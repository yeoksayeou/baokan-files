Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: The Beijing Exhibition Center and the Architectural Exhibition Center in the western suburbs of the capital are decorated with unusual freshness and beauty today. The largest exhibition in China's history, the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition, located here, will officially open tomorrow.

This exhibition was organized jointly by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and the fifteen industrial and transportation ministries of the Central Government, based on the suggestion of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Its central content is to systematically introduce the great leap forward situation and the great victories that have emerged on the industrial and transportation fronts after the Chinese people resolutely implemented the general line of socialist construction on the basis of successfully completing the first five-year plan, achieving "one day equals twenty years." Through this exhibition, the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism will be further encouraged, breaking the mysterious views on running industry and transportation, thereby pushing the current upsurge of the whole people running industry and the whole people running transportation to a new peak.

The exhibition has a total of fifteen pavilions, covering an area of approximately 40,000 square meters. These pavilions are: metallurgy, machinery, electric power, petroleum, coal, chemical industry, forestry, light industry, textile, geology, construction, railway, transportation, and post and telecommunications exhibition halls; China's emerging industrial sector - the atomic energy industry - also has a pavilion here.

Now, after several months of active preparation, all preparations for this exhibition have been completed. The square in front of the Beijing Exhibition Center has been completely renovated. Two large plaster statues representing the great image of China's working class stand valiantly in front of the square. The newly hung eighteen circular color paintings representing various industrial and transportation sectors are even more brilliant in the golden autumn sunshine. Walking into the grand arch of the exhibition hall, a spirited statue of Chairman Mao stands in the center of the hall. Slogans written in gold letters on a red background, stating the basic points of China's general line of socialist construction, have also been hung on the four walls.

The 50,000 exhibits to be displayed have already been arranged in each pavilion. Most of them are the fruits of the Great Leap Forward. Among them are models of primary rolling mills that represent China's industrial manufacturing level and can roll seven or eight-ton steel ingots into steel billets, large electric shovels that can excavate three cubic meters of earth at a time, and some components of a 2,500-ton hydraulic press that can process large steel ingots weighing more than 40 tons, various mining machinery, precision machine tools, measuring tools, cutting tools, and instruments, newly produced cars and tractors this year, new varieties of steel, non-ferrous metals, and light textile industry products, etc. Various advanced experiences that have emerged in the national industrial and transportation sectors after implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises with indigenous and foreign methods are displayed in prominent positions in each pavilion. Here are major innovations in the machinery industry – simple combined machine tools used for "ants gnawing at bones," machines made of ceramic or wood, motors using iron sheets instead of silicon steel sheets, various indigenous blast furnaces, small converters, oil refining pots, small power stations, and simple railways run by the people, etc.

The exhibition fully reflects the upsurge of the whole people running industry and the whole people running transportation that has emerged in various places across the country after the implementation of the general line of socialist construction, and the high-speed development of industry and transportation promoted by this upsurge. Many distribution maps of factories and mines arranged like stars in the sky and charts with rockets indicate that this year China's steel production will reach 10.7 million tons, doubling last year's output, coal will reach 210 million tons, only 10 million tons less than the projected output of the old British Empire this year; machine tools are expected to reach 80,000 units, more than doubling last year's output; power generation will increase by 42%; railway freight volume will increase by 31%....

In order to fully reflect the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, some pavilions have also specially set up report-good-news platforms and leap-forward platforms to report new creations and new achievements of workers in various places in a timely manner during the exhibition.

The exhibition is tentatively scheduled to last for three months. In addition to visits by the general public, technical exchange activities will also be conducted. Each pavilion has compiled more than 700 kinds of technical materials, which are sold by Xinhua Bookstore. Each pavilion has also established technical exchange groups to hold report meetings and seminars to answer various technical questions.

The exhibition also plans to show films about the Great Leap Forward and popular science and technology.

    请看全国人民在大跃进中创作的美丽画图
    全国工业交通展览会开幕
    据新华社14日讯　首都西郊的北京展览馆和建筑展览馆今天打扮得格外清新美丽，设在这里的我国历史上最大的展览会　　全国工业交通展览会，将在明天正式开幕。
    这个展览会是根据中共中央建议，由国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会和中央十五个工业交通部共同筹办的。它的中心内容，是系统地介绍我国人民在胜利完成第一个五年计划基础上，坚决执行了社会主义建设总路线以后，在工业、交通运输战线上出现的“一天等于二十年”的大跃进形势和伟大胜利。通过这次展览，将进一步鼓舞全国人民建设社会主义的热情，打破办工业和交通运输业的神秘观点，从而把当前全民办工业、全民办交通运输事业的热潮推向新的高峰。
    展览会共有十五个分馆，占地面积约四万平方公尺。这些分馆是：冶金、机械、电力、石油、煤炭、化工、森工、轻工、纺织、地质、建筑、铁道、交通和邮电展览馆；我国新兴的工业部门——原子能工业也在这里设馆展出。
    现在，这个展览会经过几个月的积极准备，各项筹备工作已经全部完成。北京展览馆前面广场上布置得焕然一新。两座表现我国工人阶级伟大形象的大石膏像英姿焕发地伫立在广场前面。新挂上去的十八幅代表各个工业交通部门的圆形采画，在秋天金色的阳光下更加灿烂夺目。走进展览馆的大拱门，神采奕奕的毛主席雕像站在大厅中央。写着我国社会主义建设总路线各个基本点的红底金字的标语牌，也已经在四壁悬挂起来。
    准备展出的五万件展品早在各分馆陈列好了。它们大部分是大跃进中的丰收果实。其中有代表我国工业制造水平的能把七、八吨重的钢锭轧制成钢胚的初轧机的模型，有一次挖土三立方公尺的大电铲，有可以加工重达四十多吨大钢锭的两千五百吨的水压机的一部分部件，各种矿山机械、精密机床、量具、刃具和仪表，今年新生产的汽车、拖拉机，新品种的钢材、有色金属和轻纺工业的产品等。全国工业交通部门在贯彻大中小型企业并举和土洋结合方针后出现的各种先进经验，在各分馆里都以显著的地位展出。这里有机械工业中的重大创举　　“蚂蚁啃骨头”用的简易组合机床，陶瓷或木头做的机器，用铁片代替矽钢片的电动机，各种土高炉、小转炉、炼油锅、小型发电站和民办简易铁路等等。
    展览会充分反映了全国人民在贯彻社会主义建设总路线后在各地出现的全民办工业，全民办交通的高潮，及由于这个高潮而促成的工业和交通运输业高速度发展的情景。许多布置得像满天星斗一样的工厂矿山分布图和画着火箭的图表表明：今年我国的钢产量将达一千零七十万吨，比去年翻一番，煤将达到二亿一千万吨，比老牌英帝国今年的预计产量只差一千万吨；机床预计为八万台，比去年增产一倍以上；发电量增长42％；铁路货运量增加31％……。
    为了充分反映全国大跃进的形势，有些分馆还专门设立了报喜台和跃进台，以便在展出期间及时报道各地职工的新创造新成就。
    展览会暂定展期为三个月。除了一般人的参观以外，并将进行技术交流活动。各馆已编写了七百多种技术资料，由新华书店负责发售。各分馆还分别成立了技术交流小组，准备举办报告会和座谈会，解答各项技术问题。
    展览会还准备放映有关大跃进和科学技术普及影片。
