Glossary of Terms

    Cheng-Zhu School of Neo-Confucianism: Cheng refers to the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi), and Zhu refers to Zhu Xi. They were all Neo-Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty. Neo-Confucianism is a philosophical field that discusses abstract principles and began to develop in the Northern Song Dynasty. Both the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi were objective idealists. Zhu Xi believed that spirit preceded matter. He called spirit "Li" (理, principle) and matter "Qi" (气, vital force). Zhu Xi said that "Li" is the root of existence, meaning that spirit is the fundamental origin of all things. The Qing Dynasty rulers, in an attempt to eliminate scholars' anti-Manchu ideas, vigorously promoted Zhu Xi, considering him the orthodox of Confucianism, and advocated the Cheng-Zhu School of Neo-Confucianism.

    Old Text School of Confucianism: At the end of the Western Han Dynasty, Confucian classics split into two schools: the Old Text School and the New Text School. At that time, the classics written in seal script (characters from the Warring States period and the small seal script of the Qin Dynasty) were called Old Texts, and the school that transmitted the Old Texts was called the Old Text School of Confucianism. The Qing Dynasty rulers adopted a high-pressure policy on culture and thought, and many Confucian scholars abandoned studying the classics for practical application, focusing instead on phonology and exegesis, leading to a great flourishing of textual research. The Old Text School of Confucianism was revived.

    Lu-Wang School: Lu refers to Lu Jiuyuan, a philosopher of the Song Dynasty who was contemporary with Zhu Xi. He had different views from Zhu Xi, advocating "The universe is my mind, and all things are complete within me," believing that the world is in my mind, and without me, there is no world. He was a subjective idealist. Wang refers to Wang Shouren (Wang Yangming), a philosopher of the Ming Dynasty. He inherited Lu Jiuyuan's philosophical views, believing that the principle of all things in the world is in people's minds. He said: "Principle is not outside my mind; to seek principle outside my mind is to find no principle at all." He believed that the reason why the mind becomes the substance of the universe and the reason why the mind is principle is because there is an innate "innate knowledge" (良知) in the human mind. Correct understanding requires clarifying the mind, and clarifying the mind is also clarifying principle. Wang Shouren's doctrines had a great influence in the Ming Dynasty.

    名词解释
    程朱理学  程是二程（程颢、程颐），朱是朱熹。他们都是宋朝的理学家。理学是讲抽象道理的属于哲学性质的学问，从北宋开始发展起来。二程、朱熹都是客观唯心主义者。朱熹认为精神先于物质。他把精神叫作“理”，物质叫作“气”。朱熹说“理”是生之本，就是说精神是产生万事万物的根本。清朝统治者企图用理学消灭学者的反满思想，极力推崇朱熹，认为是儒学正宗，提倡程朱理学。
    古文经学  西汉末年，儒家经学内部分化成今、古文经学两派，当时用篆文（战国时文字及秦小篆）写的经书叫古文经，传授古文经的学说叫古文经学。清朝统治者对文化思想采取高压政策，很多经学家放弃读经致用，专力音韵训诂，考据之学大盛，古文经学复兴。
    陆王  陆是陆九渊，是宋代和朱熹同时的哲学家。他和朱熹的见解不同，主张“宇宙即是吾心，万物皆备于我”，认为世界就在我的心里，没有我就没有世界，是个主观唯心主义者。王是王守仁，是明代的哲学家。他继承了陆九渊的哲学观点，认为天地间一切事物的理都在人的心里。他说：“物理不外吾心，外吾心而求物理，无物理矣。”他认为心所以成为宇宙的本体，心所以就是理，是因为人心里面本来有先天的“良知”。正确的认识就要明心，明心也就是明理。王守仁的学说在明代发生很大的影响。
