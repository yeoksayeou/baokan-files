　　Silage Sweet Potatoes as Feed
　　Animal Husbandry Production Bureau, Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation

　　Sweet potatoes are a favorite food of livestock and are an important feed for developing animal husbandry (especially raising dairy cows and pigs). Especially in the winter when there is a lack of succulent feed, sweet potatoes are a good succulent feed for livestock.

　　This year, the planting area of sweet potatoes has been expanded across the country, and a bumper harvest is expected. Therefore, the yield of sweet potatoes will greatly increase compared to last year. Such a large amount of sweet potatoes, in addition to being reserved for seed potatoes and human consumption, and used as raw materials for winemaking, starch, etc., will also be used as livestock feed. How can we properly store the sweet potatoes used for feed? Several state-owned farms in Beijing have some experience in making silage sweet potatoes as feed, which deserves our attention.

　　The Benefits of Silage Sweet Potatoes

　　In 1953, state-owned farms such as Shuangqiao and Nanjiao in Beijing, based on the advanced Soviet experience in making corn stalk silage, trial-produced sweet potato silage and mixed silage of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines. The test results were very good. After the cellar was opened in the spring of 1954, the quality of the silage sweet potatoes was very good, and the livestock loved to eat them. Since then, the method of making silage sweet potatoes has been promoted in state-owned farms in Beijing, and the amount of silage has increased year by year. In early 1954, a trial silage of 1.78 million jin of sweet potatoes was made, and in 1957, the amount of silage reached more than 5.8 million jin.

　　In the past few years of making sweet potato silage feed, whether making pure sweet potato tuber silage or making mixed silage of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines, in addition to normal losses (generally, sweet potatoes near the cellar wall will be lost, and the loss amount accounts for about 25% of the total storage amount), there has been no large-scale damage.

　　Sweet potato silage is a good succulent feed with good taste, many nutrients, and a sour, sweet, and slightly lees-like aroma. According to the chemical composition of the farm's feed, the nutritional value of the feed is compared as shown in the attached table.

　　From this comparison table, it can be seen that 2 jin of sweet potato silage can be equivalent to 1 jin of oats, and 2.5 jin of sweet potato silage can be equivalent to 1 jin of corn. Sweet potato silage feed can also increase the appetite of livestock, thus enhancing the health of livestock and increasing the yield of livestock products, and also saving the amount of concentrate feed. Years of experience have proved that dairy cows can increase milk production by 3 to 4 jin per day by adding silage sweet potato feed to their rations. Feeding pigs with sweet potato silage can generally increase weight by more than 1 jin per day. If you mix it with some roughage to feed sows, you can also increase the farrowing rate of pigs.

　　How to Make Sweet Potato Silage

　　Sweet potato silage feed is generally started after harvest. After about 40 to 60 days of fermentation, it can be taken out for use. After sweet potatoes are ensiled, they can be preserved for one or two years without spoiling if they are stored in a tightly closed state.

　　The method and procedure of making sweet potato silage are roughly similar to that of corn stalk silage, but because sweet potatoes contain a lot of water, in order to prevent spoilage, each operation link must be done more strictly during silage.

　　　1. Digging the cellar: The cellar site should be selected in a place that is high and dry, with firm soil, convenient drainage, low groundwater level, and no bricks or tiles mixed in the soil, and close to the livestock shed. In order to reduce transportation, cellars can also be dug on the spot in the sweet potato field for silage. When digging the cellar, the bottom of the cellar must be tamped firmly, and the cellar wall should be repaired firmly and smoothly. If conditions permit, the cellar wall and bottom can be built with bricks and stones. The bottom of the cellar should be one foot and five inches above the groundwater level to avoid water seepage from the bottom of the cellar. In areas with excessively high groundwater levels, walls can be built on the ground and the soil can be cultivated to create semi-underground cellars or above-ground cellars. The bottom of the wall of the above-ground cellar should be three and a half feet to five feet thick, and the upper thickness should be two to two and a half feet. The shape of the cellar is similar to a trough. The capacity of the cellar varies depending on the type of silage raw materials. The storage capacity of each cubic foot of the cellar is generally about 50 jin for mixed silage of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines, and 70 to 75 jin for pure sweet potato silage.

　　　2. Types of silage: It can be divided into three types: One is mixed silage of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines. The ratio of this silage is: 1 jin of sweet potatoes and 2 jin of sweet potato vines (harvested before frost), or 1 jin of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines each (harvested after frost). The second is sweet potato silage. In order to absorb the pulp juice exuded from the silage sweet potatoes, 10% to 20% of bran (rice bran, millet bran) must be added. The third is mixed silage of sweet potatoes and various dry grass powders. The ratio of silage can be half each, or about 20% of crushed dry grass (1 to 1.5 inches long) can be mixed with sweet potatoes for silage.

　　　3. Chopping sweet potatoes and filling the storage material: No matter which kind of sweet potato silage is made, the sweet potatoes or sweet potato vines used need to be air-dried in the sun for two or three days to reduce their water content. The soil attached to the sweet potatoes should be removed before air-drying. If it is firmly attached, it can be washed away with clean water. To chop sweet potatoes, you can use a straw cutter or a green feed cutter. If there is no machine, you can also put the sweet potatoes in a wooden trough and chop them with a shovel or break them with a wooden stick. If you are making mixed silage of sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines, you can mix the sweet potatoes and sweet potato vines in proportion, and use a machine to chop them at the same time and fill them into the cellar. When making silage, the chopped sweet potatoes should be mixed evenly with the bran, dry grass, and hay to be mixed.

　　When filling the cellar, it should be tamped firmly while filling the material, and each foot thick should be leveled and thoroughly tamped once, and attention should be paid to tamping the edges and corners of the cellar.

　　　4. Sealing the cellar and covering the soil: After filling the entire cellar (the middle should be about two feet higher than the cellar opening, that is, piled into a convex shape), sprinkle a layer of bran on the top of the storage material, and then cover the storage material tightly with clean hay or dry sweet potato vines, about six to eight inches thick, and then cover the cellar with soil. The soil should be tamped firmly with feet and patted with a shovel. The degree of subsidence of sweet potato silage after sealing the cellar is greater than that of silage corn stalks. Therefore, in the first few days after sealing the cellar, it should be checked every day, and soil should be filled and compacted according to the collapse situation. Generally, the top of the cellar can be plastered with mud after ten days.

　　5. Opening the cellar: Sweet potato silage can be opened for 40 to 60 days and used to feed livestock. Open the cellar from one end, open the cellar in the south in winter and open the cellar in the north in summer. After opening the cellar, take the material in sections according to the needs of each day. Each section should be dug from the top to the bottom at once, do not dig randomly, and do not dig holes. After each material is taken, it should be covered with straw or straw curtains to prevent freezing or sun exposure.

　　Several Important Experiences

　　In the past few years, state-owned farms in Beijing have achieved great success in making sweet potato silage feed and have also gained a lot of experience. These experiences are mainly:

　　1. Do a good job of preparation. Making sweet potato silage feed is a tense process. In order to make sweet potato silage well and avoid unnecessary losses, you must master the three elements of "fast, solid, and tight" during the production process. That is: make it fast, tread it solid, and seal the cellar tightly. The time for making silage is mostly during the busy farming season, and the production of silage requires completion within one or two days, so it is necessary to make plans in advance, arrange properly, designate special personnel to be responsible, and do a good job in the organization and deployment of labor.

　　2. There should be special personnel to manage and check frequently. After the silage is made, it should be checked frequently, especially in rainy areas, and each cellar should be checked after each heavy rain. The use of silage feed should be planned to prevent waste. Each farm in Beijing has designated technical personnel or technical workers to be specifically responsible for this work. Farm leaders also regularly check and supervise.

　　3. Each cellar should not be too large. It is more appropriate to store about 100,000 jin of storage material. There are many inconveniences if the silage cellar is too large, such as not being able to be filled in the shortest time during production, extending the filling time, and not being able to be used up in a short period of time after opening the cellar.

　　青贮甘薯作饲料
　　农垦部畜牧生产局
    甘薯是一种牲畜很喜欢吃的东西，是发展畜牧业（特别是养奶牛和猪）的重要饲料之一。尤其在缺乏多汁饲料的冬季，甘薯更是牲畜的良好多汁饲料。
    今年全国甘薯栽种面积扩大，丰收在望，因而甘薯产量将比去年大为增加。这样大量的甘薯，除了留作种薯和人吃，以及用作制酒、淀粉等原料以外，还有部分作为牲畜饲料。怎样才能把用在饲料上的甘薯保管好呢？北京市几个国营农场有一些青贮甘薯作饲料的经验，值得我们重视。
    青贮甘薯的好处
    北京市国营双桥、南郊等农场在1953年曾根据苏联制作玉米秸青贮的先进经验，试制了甘薯青贮、甘薯和甘薯蔓的混合青贮。试验成绩很好，经1954年春开窖检查，青贮的甘薯品质很好，牲畜都很爱吃。从此青贮甘薯的方法在北京国营农场中得到推广，青贮的数量逐年增加。1954年初试青贮甘薯一百七十八万斤，1957年青贮量达到五百八十多万斤。
    几年来在制作甘薯青贮饲料上，无论是制作纯甘薯块青贮或制作甘薯和甘薯蔓的混合青贮，除了正常的损耗（一般靠近窖壁的甘薯要损失一些，损失量约占总贮存量的25％左右）以外，并没有大量损坏过。
    甘薯青贮是一种良好的多汁饲料、味道好、养分多，并且具有酸、甜、稍带酒糟的芳香气味。如按农场饲料的化学成分，换算饲料中含有的营养价值比较如附表。
    从这个比较表中可以看出：二斤甘薯青贮即能顶上一斤燕麦，二斤半甘薯青贮能顶上一斤玉米。甘薯青贮饲料还能增加牲畜食欲，因而有增强牲畜身体健康和提高畜产品产量的作用，同时还能节省精料的喂量。几年经验证明：奶牛在口粮中增加青贮甘薯饲料，一般的奶牛每天可以增产牛奶三到四斤。用甘薯青贮喂猪，一般每天增重可达一斤以上。如果搭配一些粗饲料喂母猪，还可提高猪的产仔率。甘薯青贮的制作方法青贮甘薯饲料，一般在收获以后开始。约经过四十到六十天的发酵过程，就可以取用。甘薯青贮以后，如果使它处于密闭状态下贮藏，可以保存一、二年也不坏。
    甘薯青贮在制作方法和制作程序上同玉米秸青贮大体相似，但因甘薯含水多，为了防止腐烂，在青贮的时候，就要更严格地做好每个操作环节。
      1、挖窖：窖址应当选择地势高燥，土质坚固、排水方便、地下水位低、土内不夹杂砖石瓦块，并且接近畜舍的地方。如果为了减少运输，还可以在甘薯地里就地挖窖青贮。挖窖时必须把窖底夯实，窖壁修整坚固、平滑，条件许可时，可以用砖石砌窖壁窖底。窖底应该在地下水面上一尺五寸，以免窖底渗水。在地下水位过高的地区，可在地面筑墙培土，作成半地下窖或地上窖。地上窖墙底要厚三尺半至五尺，上厚是二至二尺半，窖形似马槽。窖的容量由于青贮的原料种类不同而不同，每一立方尺的窖藏量，一般甘薯和甘薯蔓混合青贮有五十斤左右，纯甘薯青贮有七十到七十五斤。
      2、青贮的种类：可分为三种：一种是甘薯和甘薯蔓的混合青贮。这种青贮的配合比例是：甘薯一斤、薯蔓二斤（霜前收获的），或甘薯、薯蔓各一斤（霜后收获的）。第二种是甘薯青贮。为了吸收青贮甘薯渗出的浆汁，必须掺入10％到20％的糠秕（稻糠、谷子糠）。第三种是甘薯和各种干草粉末混合青贮。青贮的比例可以各半，也可以用20％左右的碎干草（一至一寸半长）和甘薯混合青贮。
      3、甘薯的切碎和贮料的装填：不论制作哪种甘薯青贮，所用的甘薯或甘薯蔓都需要风干日晒两、三天，减低它的含水量。附着在甘薯上的泥土应在风干前去掉，如果附着牢固，可以用清水洗去。切碎甘薯可以用铡草机或青饲切割机，如果没有机械，也可以将甘薯放在木槽内用铁锹切碎或以木棍打碎。如果制作甘薯和薯蔓混合青贮时，可以将甘薯和甘薯蔓按比例混合，以机械同时切碎填入窖内。在青贮时要把切碎的甘薯和所要混合的糠秕、干草末、干草等混合均匀。
    在装窖时，要随装料随踩踏实，每填一尺厚就要摊平，彻底踩踏一次，并应注意踏实窖边窖角等处。
      4、封窖复土：装满全窖（中间要高出窖口二尺左右，即堆成凸形）以后，在贮料的上面撒一层糠秕，然后再用清洁的干草或干的薯蔓将贮料盖严，复草厚约六——八寸，然后培土封窖，培土要用脚踩实和用铁锹拍打。甘薯青贮在封窖后下陷程度比青贮玉米秸要大一些，因而在封好窖的最初几天，每天都要进行检查，并根据塌陷情况，填土补严。一般在十天以后就可以用泥将窖顶抹好。
    五、开窖：甘薯青贮四十至六十天即可开窖，用来饲喂牲畜。开窖要从窖的一头打开，冬季开窖在南口，夏季开窖在北口。开窖后，每天按需要分段取用，每段要由上部一下子挖到底，不要乱挖，更不要掏窟窿。每次取料以后，要用秸秆或草帘子复盖好。防止冻结或日晒。
    几点重要经验
    几年来北京市国营农场在制作甘薯青贮饲料方面获得了很大成功，也摸索了许多经验。这些经验主要是：
    1、做好准备工作。制作甘薯青贮饲料是一个紧张的过程，为了把甘薯青贮作好，避免不应有的损失，在制作时一定要掌握“快、实、密”三个要素，这就是：做的快、踏的实、窖封的严密。制作青贮的时间多在农忙时期，而制作青贮要求在一、二天内赶紧制完，因而事先必须作好计划，妥善安排，指定专人负责，做好劳动力组织调配。
    2、要有专人管理并要经常检查。青贮作好以后，要经常进行检查，特别是在多雨地区，在每次下大雨以后都要逐窖检查一遍。青贮饲料在饲喂上要做到有计划使用，防止浪费。北京各农场都指定有技术人员或技术工人专门负责这项工作。农场负责人也经常进行检查督促。
    3、每一个窖不宜过大，一般贮料十万斤左右，比较适宜。青贮窖过大，有很多不便的地方，如制作的时候，不能在最短时间内装满，装窖时间要延长，开窖后又不能在短时期内用完。
