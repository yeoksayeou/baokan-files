    Jinning County's Good Methods to Overcome the Severe Shortage of Labor
    Workers Help Farmers, Farmers Help Workers, Workers and Farmers Join Hands to Leap Forward
    (Our newspaper reporter Zhang Tinggan reports) Jinning County, Yunnan Province, has solved the problem of a severe labor shortage by using the method of comprehensive cooperation between industry and agriculture, enabling industrial and agricultural production to rapidly form a comprehensive leap forward situation.
    Due to the lack of a clear direction for the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture in the first half of the year in Jinning County, the development of industry and agriculture was very unbalanced. From January to May, local industry only completed 14.4% of the annual plan. Although more than 30,000 factories were nominally established, because they were not equipped with manpower, only a few county-run industries were put into production, thus becoming a backward county in the Yuxi District in terms of industry.
    With the development of agricultural production, the problem of insufficient industrial and agricultural labor became increasingly serious. Out of 70,000 laborers in the county, 30,000 were transferred to build water conservancy projects and railways. The remaining 40,000 people had to bear nearly eight mu of land per person. During the mid-tillage and summer hoeing, the workload per person increased more than tenfold compared with the same period last year. Under such circumstances, some townships and communes drew workers from local industries to engage in agricultural production, some cadres requested that people repairing water conservancy projects be transferred back to engage in mid-tillage, and some hoped to reduce the development speed of local industries. All kinds of right-leaning conservative thinkers found an excuse from the labor problem, demanding to slow down the pace of the leap forward. The county party committee analyzed the situation at the time and believed that it was necessary to rapidly develop local industries to establish a new foundation for the technological revolution in agriculture. The county party committee submitted this issue to the masses for discussion, mobilizing the masses to study solutions to the labor shortage.
    In the debate, townships and communes calculated an account: the entire mid-tillage and summer hoeing only had 1.4 million workdays, requiring the completion of more than 12 million workdays. Therefore, it was urgent to supply new agricultural tools to make up for the difference in workdays. At the same time, various townships and communes recalled that local industries supported agriculture during the spring plowing this year, saving more than 5 million workdays for agriculture; during the drought resistance, due to the supply of more than 80 water pumps by local industries, the county only mobilized more than 5,000 people to overcome the major drought that had not occurred for decades.
    After the debate, a massive mass movement of finding and reporting mines, contributing and selling materials, and supporting local industries with manpower and materials was launched in the rural areas of the county. The county party committee also made a determination to transfer another 10,000 people from the 40,000 agricultural laborers to work hard in industry. Minerals such as coal, iron, aluminum, pyrite, and refractory materials that were previously believed not to exist within the territory were also found by the masses. The slogan of the people of all ethnic groups was: "Give whatever is needed, contribute whatever there is." At the same time, the broad masses of employees also conducted a major debate on how to serve agricultural production. Through the debate, they universally criticized the idea of only focusing on output value and not wanting to produce new agricultural tools, and clarified the task of local industries. With the vigorous support of the people of the whole county, industries at the county, township, and commune levels produced 70,000 new agricultural tools, more than 500,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and 90,000 tons of native fertilizer for agricultural production in June and July. In just over ten days, every agricultural laborer in the county had a weeding rake, fertilizer delivery vehicles were popularized, and more than 30,000 new agricultural tools were prepared in advance for autumn harvesting and planting.
    Through collaboration, the problem of insufficient labor in agriculture and industry was initially resolved, and industry and agriculture simultaneously entered a higher tide of the leap forward. During the 47 days of mid-tillage and summer hoeing, a total of more than 63,000 pieces of new and improved tools were used in the county, saving more than 6.7 million workdays for agriculture. Local industries themselves also developed rapidly. By August 13, Jinning County had overfulfilled this year's leap forward plan by 125%.

    晋宁县克服劳动力严重不足的好办法
    工帮农　农帮工　工农携手跃进
    本报讯　记者张廷干报道：云南省晋宁县运用工业与农业全面协作的办法，解决了劳动力严重不足的问题，使工农业生产迅速形成了全面跃进的局面。
    晋宁县由于上半年对工农业并举的方针不够明确，工农业的发展很不平衡。1至5月，地方工业只完成全年计划的14.4％，虽然名义上办了三万多个厂，因为没有配备人力，只有少数县办工业投入了生产，因而成为玉溪专区工业方面的落后县。
    随着农业生产的发展，工农业劳动力不足的问题日益严重。全县七万个劳动力抽调了三万个去修水利和铁路，剩下的四万人，平均每人负担近八亩地，在中耕夏锄中，每人的工作量比去年同期增加了十倍以上。在这种情况下，有的乡、社便把地方工业的工人抽来搞农业生产，有的干部要求把修水利的人调回来搞中耕，也有人希望降低地方工业的发展速度。各种有右倾保守思想的人都从劳动力问题上找到了借口，要求放慢跃进的脚步。县委分析了当时的情况，认为必须迅速发展地方工业，为农业的技术革命建立新的基础。县委把这个问题提交群众讨论，发动群众研究解决劳动力不足的办法。
    在辩论中，乡乡社社算了一笔账：整个中耕夏锄中，只有一百四十万个劳动日，需要完成一千二百多万个劳动日的工作量，因此迫切需要供应新式农具，才能补足劳动日的差额。同时各乡社回忆了：今年春耕中地方工业支援农业，为农业节省了五百多万个劳动日的情况；在抗旱中，由于地方工业供给了八十多部抽水机，全县只出动了五千多人，就战胜了几十年来没有过的大干旱的事实。
    经过辩论，全县农村展开了声势浩大的找矿报矿、献料售料和以人力物力支援地方工业的全民运动，县委也下决心从四万个农业劳动力中再抽调一万人大干工业。过去认为境内没有的煤、铁、铝、黄铁、耐火材料等矿产，也被群众找到了。各族农民的口号是：“要什么给什么，有什么出什么”。同时，广大职工也进行了怎样为农业生产服务的大辩论，通过辩论，普遍批判了只想抓产值，不愿生产新式农具的思想，明确了地方工业的任务。在全县人民的大力支援下，县乡社各级工业在6、7月份，就为农业生产了七万件新式农具，五十多万吨磷肥和九万吨土化肥。在十多天内，就做到了全县每个农业劳动力一把薅秧耙，送肥车子化，并提前为秋收秋种准备了三万多件新农具。
    通过协作，使农业和工业的劳动力不足问题得到了初步解决，工农业同时进入了一个跃进的更高潮。在四十七天的中耕夏锄中，全县共使用了新式改良工具六万三千多件，为农业节省了六百七十多万个劳动日。地方工业本身也很快发展起来，到8月13日，晋宁县已经超额125％完成了今年的跃进计划。
