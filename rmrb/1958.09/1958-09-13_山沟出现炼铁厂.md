Zhangjiakou Prefecture Small Blast Furnace Command Post, Wu Guichun

The countryside has changed its appearance,
Iron smelting plants appear in mountain valleys.
Lacking materials, we make our own,
Our mountain valleys are full of treasures.
Even if the mountains are high and the roads are dangerous,
Everyone goes up the mountains to find treasures.
Zhuge Liang and Lu Ban are all at work,
Mountain valleys have become iron smelting plants.
Rainbows hang in the sky,
Songs fill the mountains.
The blast furnace produces iron, red as the sky,
People's laughter is like a mountain torrent.

    山沟出现炼铁厂
    张家口专署小高炉指挥部　吴贵春如今乡村变了样，山沟出现炼铁厂。缺材少料自己搞，咱们山沟遍地宝。那怕山高路多险，人人上山把宝找。诸葛鲁班齐上阵，山沟成了炼铁厂。彩虹挂天边，歌声满山巅。高炉出铁满天红，人们的笑声像山洪。
