    纸厂也炼钢
    （粤曲平喉）
    全国曲艺会演广东省代表团　黄锦培
    （胡姬怨）真真欢畅，一夜炼成功高级钢。（重句）干劲冲天，斗志昂扬，齐齐落力，运砂拾煤，炼出一炉钢。
    （爽二王）广州纸厂，炼成矽钢，全厂工人，原非在行，会炼钢。
    （了缘曲）总路线，放光芒，照耀四方，大家决心，齐心建筑炼钢工场。
    （白杭）炼钢号角响，干部带头忙，工人四面来，磨拳又擦掌，不怕烈日晒，心热赛太阳。我搬耐火砖，你挖粘土壤，国家工业化，炼钢定主张。虽然穷且白，齐将办法想。不用十五年，定比英国强。
    （爽?板）陈副书记，亲任队长，昼夜策划，指挥炼钢、工场。工人们，已经换了几班，但系陈副书记，并未休息、半趟。还有封厂长、与张书记，搬砂担石，同大家一样、奔忙。
    （中板）为了社会主义，思想解放，纸厂也炼成钢，功绩辉煌。国家工业化，无钢无得讲，领导干部带头，力量来自多方，保健站邓素云，担焦煤不肯让，黎国强技士，绘图又砌墙，托儿所臧克，把砂土运上，周老技师，把排管安装。
    （三字句）不论老技师，或系小学校长，下班之后，都来帮忙。
    （快中板）热火朝天，齐来炼钢，支援建设理应当。
    （滚花）广州纸厂，钢花怒放，一齐跟着总路线方向，飞奔前方。
