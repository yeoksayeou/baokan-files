Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th: Anhui Province is vigorously organizing the masses to mine iron ore. By September 11th, the province had mined 2.94 million tons of iron ore. In addition to ensuring the production of various blast furnaces in the province, 100,000 tons were transferred to support other provinces.

Anhui Province plans to mine 6.48 million tons of iron ore this year. To ensure the completion of this task, 14 counties and 2 cities in the province have mobilized more than 140,000 people to participate in the ore mining work. They have overcome difficulties such as insufficient labor, technical force, and equipment, and the output of ore has continued to increase. From September 1st to 11th, the average daily output of ore reached more than 32,000 tons, more than double the average daily output in August.

The enthusiasm and creativity shown by the broad masses in mining ore is unprecedented. In Xiaopeng, Huangpu, and six other townships and one town in Tongcheng County, more than 6,900 cadres and masses, led by the township Party secretaries themselves, launched a great battle to pan for iron sand in the Dahe River. In just four days and nights from August 30th to September 3rd, they panned one million jin of iron sand from the Dahe River. In the Yeshan mining area of ​​Tongling County, after the transportation work from the foot of the mountain to the mine was changed from manual carrying to cable car transportation, the amount of ore transported by each person per day increased from the original 390 jin to more than 2,280 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th: From the Greater Khingan Mountains to the Helan Mountains in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, an advance force of 200,000 farmers, herdsmen, and workers of all ethnic groups is working day and night to mine and transport ore. They are working hard in the deep mountains and wilderness, enduring all kinds of hardships. Recently, they have mined more than 620,000 tons of iron ore.

In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area of ​​the Zhaowuda League in the southeast of the Autonomous Region, more than 30,000 people of Mongolian, Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups, led by Party secretaries at all levels, have been climbing mountains and wading through rivers to develop mineral deposits for months. By the beginning of September, the output of iron, copper, lead, and other ores had reached more than 60,000 tons, ensuring the production needs of the 383 newly built small blast furnaces. In the Ulanqab League, 50,000 people are put into the mining and iron smelting campaign every day. By the 16th, more than 500 indigenous blast furnaces had been built, producing about 100 tons of iron and steel.

The upsurge of all people mining and smelting is gradually developing towards the grasslands and deserts of Inner Mongolia. Mongolian herdsmen and lamas in the Xilin Gol League, together with local workers, are mining iron ore, copper ore, refining coke, and making refractory bricks. The ten or so indigenous iron and copper smelting furnaces they have built have already produced the first batch of pig iron and copper ingots.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Kang Guozhi reports: While universally using indigenous methods to mine small iron mines, Jilin Province is concentrating efforts in various aspects to fully cooperate, using semi-mechanized methods to focus on mining more than ten medium-sized iron mines with large reserves and high grades in eight counties in the province. Therefore, the output of iron ore has been rapidly increased. As of the 18th, the province had mined more than 134,000 tons of iron ore, most of which was mined from key mines. The ore that has already been mined is enough for the province to complete the need of smelting 30,000 tons of iron in September. Now all localities are storing ore to welcome a larger iron smelting task in October.

Since Jilin Province's iron ore resources are scattered, more than 20 cities and counties in the province are mobilizing the masses to mine iron ore locally by hand. This method of mining is less efficient and transportation is also inconvenient. Therefore, in late August, relevant departments organized the technical forces and mechanical equipment of four cities, eight counties, five provincial-run mines, and some coal mines and forestry bureaus at the same time to focus on mining more than ten medium-sized iron mines with large reserves and high grades, so that large and small mines could be developed simultaneously. The ore produced by these key mines this year will account for more than 70% of the total ore required by the province.

At present, the five provincial-run mines alone have supported the key iron mines with more than 800 technical cadres and workers, and supplied more than 40 rock drills and a batch of air compressors and other power equipment. With the support of all parties, the daily output of the Heping Iron Mine in Chefeng County reached 2,000 tons on the 17th, an increase of more than 1,000 tons compared with the average daily output in early September. The average daily output of other key iron mines is also around 1,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Ma Ming reports: Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, is taking measures to solve the problems of insufficient tools and lack of mining technology for farmers who go to the mountains to mine.

There are currently more than 200,000 farmers in Yuci Prefecture mining in the Taihang and Lüliang Mountains. As of the 14th, 151,686 tons of ore have been mined. The current problem is that the mining efficiency is low, and the daily mining volume between mining units also varies greatly. There are two main reasons: one is the lack of tools, and the other is that the mining personnel lack the ability to identify ore and the technology of mining, which greatly affects the mining efficiency.

The Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county committees studied the above situation and took many effective measures. In terms of tools: (1) Requisitioning excavation and transportation tools that are temporarily not needed for building reservoirs; (2) Selecting steel drills, iron hammers, iron bars, and other tools and substitute tools from the scrap iron purchased from various places. Yuci and Shouyang counties have picked out more than 2,000 tools; (3) Mobilizing large factories and coal mines to support mining work in various places; (4) 140 tons of raw steel have been transferred from civil construction and other aspects in the entire prefecture, and machine processing plants, carpenters and handicrafts cooperatives have been organized to rush to make mining tools for various mining areas day and night. In terms of mining technology: (1) More than 500 geological exploration personnel currently in the entire prefecture, belonging to the central, provincial, and prefectural levels, have gone to key mining counties and iron ore areas to explore resources while explaining ore grades to the masses and providing technical guidance; (2) A group of technical workers with mining experience were transferred from more than 100 large and small coal mines in the entire region, and used the method of masters teaching apprentices to provide technical guidance in the mines; (3) A group of professionals were trained in each mining team and group to improve the level of mining technology, and on-site promotion meetings were held with mines as schools and construction sites as classrooms, various ore samples were exhibited, and geological mining education was carried out for farmers using examples.

    吉林集中力量先采富矿　榆次解决工具技术问题
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省大力组织群众开采铁矿石，到9月11日止，全省已采出铁矿石二百九十四万吨。这些矿石除保证了全省各种高炉的生产以外，还调出了十万吨支援外省。
    安徽省今年计划开采铁矿石六百四十八万吨。为了保证这一任务的完成，全省已有十四个县和两个市发动了十四万多人参加矿石开采工作。他们克服了劳动力、技术力量和设备不足等困难，使矿石的开采量不断增加。9月1日至11日，平均每天矿石的产量达到三万二千多吨，比8月份每天的平均产量增加了一倍以上。
    广大群众在开采矿石中表现出来的那股积极性和创造精神是罕见的。桐城县晓棚、黄铺等八个乡和一个镇就有六千九百多名干部和群众，由各乡党委书记亲自率领向大河展开了淘铁砂的大战。仅8月30日到9月3日的四天四夜中，就从大河里淘出了一百万斤铁砂。铜陵县叶山矿区从山脚到矿厂的运输工作，由人工挑改用滑车运输后，每人每天运送的矿石由原来的三百九十斤增加到二千二百八十多斤。
    据新华社呼和浩特19日电　内蒙古自治区从大兴安岭到贺兰山，由二十万各族农牧民、职工组成的钢铁前哨大军，正在为采运矿石夜以继日地苦战着。他们在深山荒野中不辞千辛万苦，风餐露宿，最近已开采出铁矿石六十二万多吨。
    在自治区东南部的昭乌达盟半农半牧区，各级党委书记率领的三万多名蒙古、汉、回等族人民，连月来爬山涉水开发矿藏，到9月初，采出的铁、铜、铅等矿石已达六万多吨，保证了当地新建三百八十三座小高炉的生产需要。乌兰察布盟每天有五万人投入采矿炼铁运动，到16日止，已建起土高炉五百多座，生产出钢铁一百吨左右。
    全民采矿冶炼高潮正逐渐向内蒙古草原、沙漠地带发展。锡林郭勒盟的蒙古族牧民和喇嘛们，同当地职工一起，开采铁矿石、铜矿石，炼焦炭，制耐火砖，他们建成的十多座炼铁、炼铜土炉，已经生产出第一批生铁和铜锭。
    据新华社长春19日电　新华社记者康国志报道：吉林省在普遍用土法开采小铁矿同时，集中多方面力量充分协作，采用半机械化的方法突击开采省内八个县的十多个矿量大、品位高重点中型铁矿，因此迅速提高了铁矿石的产量。到18日止，全省已采出铁矿石十三万四千多吨，其中大部分都是从重点矿山开采出来的。已经采出的矿石，足够全省完成9月份炼铁三万吨的需要。现在各地正在为迎接10月份更大的炼铁任务储备矿石。
    由于吉林省的铁矿资源分散，全省有二十多个市、县都在发动群众就地采用手工方法开采铁矿石。这种方法开采效率较低，运输也不方便。因此，有关部门就在8月下旬同时组织四个市、八个县、五个省营矿山，以及部分煤矿、森工局等单位的技术力量和机械设备，重点开采十多个矿量大、品位高的中型铁矿，使开采大矿和小矿同时并举。这些重点矿山，今年出产的矿石将占到全省矿石需要总量的70％以上。
    目前仅省营五个矿山就给重点铁矿支援了八百多名技术干部和工人，供应了四十多台凿岩机和一批压风机等动力设备。在各方面支援下，车丰县和平铁矿的日产量在17日已达到二千吨，比9月上旬平均日产量提高了一千多吨。其他重点铁矿的平均日产量也在千吨上下。
    据新华社太原19日电　新华社记者马明报道：山西省榆次专区正在采取措施，解决上山采矿农民工具不足和缺乏采矿技术的问题。
    榆次专区到太行、吕梁两大山区采矿的农民目前有二十多万人，到14日为止已经采出矿石十五万一千六百八十六吨。目前存在的问题是采矿效率低，各个采矿单位之间的每日采矿量也相差悬殊。主要原因有两个：一个是工具不足。另一个原因是采矿人员缺乏识别矿石的能力和采矿的技术，大大地影响了采矿效率。
    中共榆次地委和各县委研究了上述情况，采取了许多有效措施。在工具方面：（一）挪用修建水库暂时不需要的开凿运输工具；（二）从各地收购的废铁中挑选钢钎、铁锤、铁杠等工具和代用工具，榆次、寿阳两县已经拣出了两千多件工具；（三）发动大工厂煤矿支援各地采矿工作；（四）从全专区民用建筑和其他方面，已经调出一百四十吨原钢，组织各机器加工厂、铁木匠和手工业社，日夜为各矿区赶制采矿工具。在采矿技术方面：（一）全专区现有中央、省、专区属的地质勘探人员五百多人，都分赴采矿重点县和铁矿区，一边勘探资源，一边向群众讲解矿石品位，进行技术指导；（二）从全区一百多个大小煤矿中抽调一批具有采矿经验的技术工人，用师傅带徒弟的办法，到矿山进行技术辅导；（三）在每个采矿队、组中培养一批专业人员，提高采矿技术水平，并以矿山为学校、工地为课堂召开现场促进会，展览各种矿石样品，用实例向农民进行地质采矿教育。
