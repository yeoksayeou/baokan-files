Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: The suburbs of Beijing have already realized the people's commune system. The original 1,680 agricultural cooperatives in the entire suburban area, including 464,570 peasant households, have been merged and established as 56 people's communes. Each commune averages 8,000 households, the largest commune has more than 20,000 households, and the smallest has more than 1,300 households.

The movement to establish communes in the suburbs began in mid-July. The broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, all believe that establishing communes is another great joyous event after agricultural cooperativization. In Fengtai District, within a few days, more than 27,000 cooperative members wrote applications to the local Party committee to join the commune. Thousands upon thousands of big-character posters and reports of good news supporting the establishment of communes were posted on the streets of many villages. On the night of the discussion about establishing a commune, members of the original Liming Cooperative drove out two tractors overnight and worked until dawn, deep plowing twelve mu of wheat fields. Currently, the entire suburban area is filled with songs praising the goodness of socialism and the goodness of people's communes. The eight communes in Shunyi District successively held founding meetings from August 29th to September 1st, forming an unprecedented festival of nationwide celebration of the commune. At the founding meeting of the Mulindongfanghong People's Commune, members wrote on large signs: "Beans one zhang three [丈三, approx. 3.9 meters], sunflowers can be umbrellas, grains of rice are like eggs, sweet potatoes are dug out like boats, as long as we work hard to the sky, what is difficult about it."

After the realization of the people's commune system in the suburbs, a new upsurge of production was quickly launched. The Weixing (Satellite) People's Commune in Changping District organized a deep plowing team and a manure delivery team of 15,000 people to fully deep plow the land and deliver fertilizer in a timely manner. From August 28th to 30th, Tongzhou District organized more than 11,000 people in wheat specialized teams in only five villages, eating and living in the fields, rushing to deliver manure and deep plow day and night. To sow 400,000 mu of wheat, the entire district has already accumulated nearly 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. In order to deliver fertilizer to the fields in a timely manner, the Liqiao People's Commune in Shunyi District is working hard day and night to realize the motorization of transportation, the rubber-tiring of large carts, the ball-bearing of axles, and the roadification of traffic.

    人人喜气洋洋投入新的生产高潮
    首都郊区跨进公社大道
    新华社11日讯　北京市郊区已经实现了人民公社化。全郊区原有的一千六百八十个农业社，包括农户四十六万四千五百七十户，已合并建立为五十六个人民公社。每个公社平均八千户，最大的公社有两万多户，最小的一千三百多户。
    郊区建立公社的运动是从7月中旬开始的。广大群众，尤其是贫农和下中农，都认为办公社是农业合作化后的又一件大喜事。在丰台区，几天之内就有二万七千多社员向所在地党委写了入公社申请书，许多乡的街道上都贴出了成千上万张拥护办公社的大字报和喜报。原黎明社社员在讨论建立公社的当晚，连夜开出两台拖拉机，一直干到天亮，深翻了十二亩麦田。目前整个郊区到处是社会主义好和人民公社好的歌声。顺义区八个公社，在8月29日到9月1日相继举行了成立大会，形成了全民性的欢庆公社的空前盛节。在木林东方红人民公社成立大会上，社员们在大字标牌上写着：“豆角一丈三，葵花能当伞，谷粒赛鸡蛋，白薯挖成船，只要冲天干，这有什么难。”
    郊区实现人民公社化后，迅速掀起了新的生产高潮。昌平区卫星人民公社组织了一万五千人的深耕队、送粪队，全力深翻土地，及时送肥。通州区从8月28日到30日，仅五个乡就组织了一万一千多人的小麦专业队，在地里吃、地里住，日夜突击送粪和深翻土地。全区为播种四十万亩小麦，已经积肥每亩近十万斤。顺义区李桥人民公社为了把肥料及时送到地里去，正在日夜苦战，实现运输车子化、大车胶轮化、滚珠轴承化和交通公路化。
