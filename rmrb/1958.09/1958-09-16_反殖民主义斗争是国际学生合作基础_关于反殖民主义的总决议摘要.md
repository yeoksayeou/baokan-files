Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: The following is a summary of the general resolution on anti-colonialism passed by the Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students:

The Fifth Congress of the International Union of Students recognizes that the global struggle of students against colonialism and for national independence is the most important characteristic of the international student movement.

The Congress notes with satisfaction that during this period, in many regions of Asia and Africa, the majority of the people have participated in this struggle, determined to strive for the independence of their motherland and defend their national sovereignty; the Congress attaches great importance to the heroic struggles of Algeria, Cameroon, Cyprus, and Black Africa, and the victory of the people of the Middle East, North Africa, and Indonesia against colonial aggression.

The Congress emphasizes the increasingly significant contributions made by students and their organizations to the noble struggle to eliminate colonialism.

The Congress takes into account that in many countries of the world, people are still suffering from the poison of colonialism, colonial wars are still continuing in Algeria, Cameroon, and elsewhere, and the inhuman atrocities of colonial armies are undermining the just aspirations of the people and students.

The Congress takes into account that recently, colonialist and imperialist countries in many parts of the world, such as Indonesia, the Middle East, and North Africa, have been trying in every possible way to put their shackles back on peace-loving people. Colonialism endangers civilization and national traditions, hinders the comprehensive development of national education and culture, hinders the political, economic, and social development of various nations, threatens world peace, intensifies international tensions, deprives academic freedom, prohibits the pursuit of knowledge, and suffocates freedom of thought, speech, and association.

The Congress pledges its full support to the struggle of students and people for national independence, declares that the anti-colonial struggle is one of the foundations of international student cooperation, and that no national or international student organization can ignore or stand outside the anti-colonial movement. The Congress calls on all national and international student organizations to strengthen their actions in support of the anti-colonial struggle of students; and believes that these joint actions will unite students of all countries in friendship.

The Congress urges students in colonial countries and other countries to oppose all forms of teaching and propaganda that defend colonialism; and to do everything possible to help students in colonial countries fighting for national independence.

The Congress is convinced that the International Union of Students, faithful to its traditions and concerned about the needs and demands of students around the world, will continue to take a firm stand in support of all activities aimed at ending colonialism and human shame.

    反殖民主义斗争是国际学生合作基础
    关于反殖民主义的总决议摘要
    新华社15日讯　国际学联第五届代表大会通过的关于反殖民主义的总决议（摘要）
    国际学联第五届代表大会认识到学生反殖民主义、争取民族独立的世界性斗争是国际学生运动的最重要的特点。
    大会满意地注意到，这个时期内，在亚非许多地区，大部分人民都参加了这个斗争，决心争取祖国的独立，保卫他们的民族主权；大会十分重视阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、塞浦路斯、黑非洲的英勇斗争，中东、北非、印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义侵略的胜利。
    大会强调指出，学生和他们的组织对消灭殖民主义的崇高斗争所作的具有重大意义的越来越多的贡献。
    大会考虑到世界许多国家里，人民仍然受到殖民主义的毒害，殖民战争仍然在阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆和其他地方继续进行着，殖民主义军队惨无人道的暴行破坏了人民和学生的正义的愿望。
    大会考虑到最近殖民主义和帝国主义国家在世界许多地方，如印度尼西亚、中东、北非，千方百计地要把它们的枷锁重新加在热爱和平的人民的身上。殖民主义危害了文明和民族传统，妨碍了民族教育和文化的全面发展，妨碍了各民族政治、经济、社会的发展，威胁了世界和平，加剧了国际紧张局势，剥夺了学术自由，禁止了对知识的追求，扼杀了思想、言论、结社的自由。
    大会保证全力支持学生和人民一起争取民族独立的斗争，宣布反殖民主义斗争是国际学生合作的基础之一，任何全国性或国际性学生组织都不能漠视或置身于反殖民主义运动以外。大会号召所有全国性和国际性学生组织加强他们支持学生反殖民主义斗争的行动；相信这些共同行动将把各国学生团结在友谊之中。
    大会敦促殖民地国家和其他国家的学生反对为殖民主义辩护的一切教学和宣传形式；尽一切力量帮助争取民族独立的殖民地国家中的学生。
    大会深信，国际学联忠实于他们的传统，关心世界各国学生的需要和要求，并将继续采取坚定的立场支持旨在结束殖民主义和人类耻辱的一切活动。
