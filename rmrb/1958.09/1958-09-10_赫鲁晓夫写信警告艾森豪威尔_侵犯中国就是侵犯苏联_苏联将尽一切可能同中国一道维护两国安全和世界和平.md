Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: TASS, Moscow, September 8th: "An infringement upon our great friend, ally, and neighbor, the People's Republic of China, is an infringement upon the Soviet Union. Faithful to its obligations, our country will do everything possible, together with the People's China, to safeguard the security of both countries, the interests of peace in the Far East, and the interests of world peace." The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, wrote a letter to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, on the 7th regarding the situation in the Taiwan area, making the above stern warning. Khrushchev said in the letter, "If someone in the United States comes to the conclusion that China can still be dealt with in the same way as some great powers in the past, then that is a great miscalculation. This miscalculation may have serious consequences for the cause of world peace. So let us make the matter completely clear, because ambiguity and misunderstanding about such things are the most dangerous of all."

This letter from Khrushchev has been handed over to Eisenhower by the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Davis. Khrushchev said in the letter that due to the policy adopted by the United States towards China, especially the actions currently taken by the U.S. government in the Taiwan and Taiwan Strait areas of China, a dangerous situation has formed in the Far East. Mankind is once again faced with the direct threat of war.

The main source of the current tense—and it must be said straightforwardly—very, very dangerous situation lies in the fact that the United States has forcibly occupied Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times, continues to occupy these territories, and is also attempting to expand its aggression to China's coastal islands.

Khrushchev said to Eisenhower, don't you think that moving warships around, to a large extent, is no longer of much significance, at least for countries with modern weapons? The era of the supremacy of surface fleets has passed, and this era is gone forever. In the era of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons, which are unprecedentedly powerful and act unprecedentedly quickly, these naval warships, which used to be terrifying, can actually only be used for ceremonial visits and firing salutes, and they can also be used as targets for appropriate types of rockets.

When talking about the U.S. policy of intimidation, Khrushchev said, it can be said with complete certainty that threats and intimidation will not frighten the Chinese people. This can be seen very clearly from the statement made by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on September 6. The Chinese people hope for peace and are defending peace, but they are not afraid of war. If anyone wants to impose war on China, then we have no doubt that the Chinese people will definitely give the aggressor the response it deserves.

"If an attempt is made to regard this letter I am giving you as an intentional exaggeration, or even some kind of threat, then that is far from the actual situation. We just want to remind you of the situation that we and you cannot escape if war breaks out in the Far East. We hope to find a common language with you in order to stop the current rapidly deteriorating situation and use the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, and other countries to eliminate the tense situation in the Far East."

Khrushchev emphasized in the letter that China has every legitimate right to take all necessary measures against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The actions of the U.S. government are a completely different matter, attempting to obtain the right to send its armed forces to places tens of thousands of miles away from the United States to guard the Chinese islands it has occupied. It is no accident that even allies who have formed military groups with the United States are quite loudly condemning the policy adopted by the United States towards China as unrealistic and dangerous.

The Soviet government believes that the United States must first abandon its narrow and fundamentally unrealistic attitude towards the great historical changes that have taken place in China, must recognize the legitimate rights and interests of the People's Republic of China, and must forever end its policy of provocation and blackmail against the Chinese people.

As long as the U.S. fleet does not withdraw from the Taiwan Strait, as long as U.S. troops do not leave Taiwan and return home, there will be no lasting peace in the Far East.

Khrushchev finally emphasized that whether the Far East can maintain peace or continue to become a dangerous source of war will entirely depend on the future actions of the United States.

　　赫鲁晓夫写信警告艾森豪威尔
　　侵犯中国就是侵犯苏联
　　苏联将尽一切可能同中国一道维护两国安全和世界和平
　　水上舰队全盛的时代已经一去不复返了。在核武器和火箭武器的时代，这些海军军舰实际上只能鸣鸣礼炮和作为火箭的打靶目标。
　　希望用苏联、美国、中国和其他国家的共同努力来消除远东紧张局势。
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：“对我国伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的侵犯也就是对苏联的侵犯。忠于自己义务的我国，将尽一切可能同人民中国一道来维护两国的安全、维护远东和平的利益和世界和平的利益。”苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫7日就台湾地区局势问题写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，提出上述严正警告。赫鲁晓夫在信中说，“如果在美国有人得出结论，认为还可以像过去某些列强那样来对付中国的话，那就大大失算了。这种失算可能给世界和平事业带来严重的后果。所以还是让我们把问题完全说清楚，因为对这样的事情含含糊糊和发生误解，是最危险不过的。”
    赫鲁晓夫这封信已经让美国驻苏联临时代办戴维斯转交给艾森豪威尔。赫鲁晓夫在信中说，由于美国对中国所采取的政策，特别是由于美国政府目前在中国的台湾和台湾海峡地区所采取的行动，在远东形成了危险局势。人类又一次面临着燃起战火的直接威胁。
    当前紧张的——而且必须直截了当地说——非常非常危险的局势，其主要根源在于，美国以武力侵占了自古以来就是中国的领土——台湾和澎湖列岛，继续占领着这些领土，并且还企图把它的侵略扩大到中国的沿海岛屿。
    赫鲁晓夫向艾森豪威尔说，您不觉得把军舰调来调去，在很大程度上至少是对于拥有现代武器的国家现在已经没有什么意义了么？水上舰队全盛的时代已经过去了，这个时代已经一去不复返了。在威力空前强大、作用空前迅速的核武器和火箭武器的时代，这些过去曾经是可怕的海军军舰实际上只能用作礼节上的访问和鸣鸣礼炮而已，它们还可以作为适当类型的火箭的打靶目标。
    在谈到美国的恫吓政策时赫鲁晓夫说，可以完全肯定地说：威胁和恫吓是吓不倒中国人民的。这一点从中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来9月6日的声明中就可以很清楚地看出来。中国人民希望和平，并且正在捍卫着和平，但是他们并不害怕战争。如果有人想把战争强加在中国身上，那末我们丝毫也不怀疑，中国人民必将给予侵略者以应有的回击。
    “如果企图把我给您的这封信看作是有意过分渲染，甚至是某种威胁的话，那就离实际情况太远了。我们只不过想提醒您注意到假如在远东燃起战火、你们和我们都逃脱不了的那种局面。我们希望能同你们找到共同的语言，以便制止目前这种急转直下的局势，用苏联、美国、中华人民共和国和其他国家的共同努力来消除远东的紧张形势。”
    赫鲁晓夫在信中强调说，中国完全有合法权利来对蒋介石这个卖国贼采取一切必要的措施。而美国政府的行动却完全是另外一回事，它企图取得这样一种权利，即派遣它的武装部队到离美国十万八千里的地方去把守它所侵占的中国岛屿。甚至同美国组成军事集团的盟国也相当大声地斥责美国对中国所采取的政策是不现实的和危险的，这并不是偶然的。
    苏联政府认为，美国首先必须放弃对中国发生的伟大历史变化采取狭隘的根本不现实的态度，必须承认中华人民共和国的合法权利和利益，必须永远结束对中国人民进行挑衅和讹诈的政策。
    只要美国舰队不撤离台湾海峡，只要美国兵不离开中国的台湾，不撤回家去，远东就不会有持久的和平。
    赫鲁晓夫最后强调指出，远东是否能保持和平还是继续成为危险的战争策源地，这将完全取决于美国今后的行动。
