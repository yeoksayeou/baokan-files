    Rally Under the Red Flag of Laborers
    Should we be laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, or intellectuals who are physically lazy and know nothing about agriculture and are detached from labor? This is an important ideological problem that needs to be resolved by young students and teachers across the country.
    Our people's education serves politics and is integrated with labor. To thoroughly solve the problem of education serving politics, we must further solve the problem of combining education with labor. Education serving politics must be reflected through the combination of education and productive labor, so that our education can strongly promote the development of socialist productive forces. Conversely, only under the principle of education serving politics can we guarantee the socialist orientation of education and ensure that education is truly combined with productive labor to serve socialist production. In the socialist Great Leap Forward, universities and colleges across the country have already taken a step forward in combining education and labor, such as implementing work-study programs, half-work and half-study programs, running factories and farms, and linking up with factories and rural areas outside the school, etc. Many students have been tempered and improved through labor. The idea that labor is valuable has been imprinted in people's hearts. Many students not only enthusiastically participated in work-study programs but also truly solved problems ideologically. However, a thorough and comprehensive examination will show that the concept of combining education and labor has not been consolidated. Therefore, this education needs to be further strengthened.
    The laborers we want to cultivate are those who have a high degree of socialist consciousness and a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, that is, those who are both red and expert, capable of both literary and military skills, capable of working at both higher and lower levels, integrating mental and physical labor, and combining experts and laborers, intellectuals and workers and peasants into completely new people. They throw themselves into factories and rural areas, work with workers and peasants, engage in productive labor, solve new problems raised in production practice, better promote the Great Leap Forward in production, and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland. The view that workers and peasants only engage in simple physical labor is incorrect. In the socialist Great Leap Forward, workers and peasants are constantly creating unprecedented miracles in production. Workers created a tool that can do twenty years of work in one day; peasants plant experimental fields, raising the yield of wheat and rice to an unprecedented level of thousands or tens of thousands of catties per mu. This shows that workers and peasants are engaged in heroic and magnificent undertakings. To be a creative worker or peasant, we still need to work hard. A college student who participated in factory labor held the pliers, hunched over, with his legs squatting and his head twisted backward, afraid of being touched. The worker criticized him, saying, "This is not setting off firecrackers during the Spring Festival!" It can be seen that if college students do not go to labor to train themselves, they cannot even be ordinary workers or peasants. The ultimate purpose of learning and mastering knowledge is to use it in practice and guide practice. Only by handing over knowledge to the working people and combining it with labor can we truly create something. Only by solving practical problems can we truly benefit the people, the country, and ourselves. The argument that "it is a waste for college students to be workers, peasants, and laborers!" reflects the bourgeois idea that mental labor is superior. To be a versatile person who understands both politics and business, who has both knowledge and experience, who can engage in both mental and physical labor, is precisely the talent needed by socialism; while to be a bookworm who is detached from production, detached from reality, unable to carry burdens on their shoulders or baskets in their hands is the greatest waste! We must not only use our brains to labor but also use our hands to labor. This is the general law of nature pointed out by Marx. In class society, the exploiting classes reject this law; while in socialist society, everyone must adapt to and master this law to become a laborer.
    Participating in productive labor can strengthen students' labor concepts, enrich their knowledge of production struggles, and enhance their physical fitness, which is of great significance to the all-round development of students. Young students who resolutely implement the combination of education and labor are working enthusiastically and getting more and more energetic. New products are blooming in their hands; new knowledge is gushing out in front of them. "One month of productive labor is better than studying half a year of technology." "Participating in labor, we have a common language with workers and peasants." "In the past, we would drag out or avoid labor as much as possible, but now we feel uncomfortable when we are idle and have nothing to do!" "Participating in labor, we sleep better and don't need to take medicine." Students have created many new products that have reached and surpassed world levels! These are all the crystallization of students combining education with productive labor. A college student wrote a poem praising labor, saying, "If it weren't for hard work and frugality, how could we be both red and expert?" This is a correct understanding; but some people worry and say, "Combining education and labor will reduce teaching quality." Is this really the case? We must ask: What is the quality required by socialist education? It is to cultivate students to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, that is, to enable students to develop in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. The exploiting classes, however, use the old scale of "all occupations are inferior, only studying is noble" to measure teaching quality. Some bourgeois experts and professors believe that as long as students learn book knowledge well, they can be given a score of five, regardless of whether they get zero points in labor production. What do these bourgeois experts and professors teach students? Some rice experts cannot grow rice, some construction experts cannot build corners, and some entomology experts only study the length of insects' antennae and the number of times their wings vibrate per second, but are ignorant of how to prevent and control them. Some professors are teaching current students with textbooks from years or even decades ago. May I ask, what do young students learn in such textbook teaching? Even if they learn a lot of such book knowledge, it is of no help and is not needed in practice. If book knowledge is not combined with productive labor, it will become dead knowledge, and there is no quality to speak of. Only by combining it with productive labor will it become living knowledge, will we gain comprehensive and rich real skills, and will we achieve the quality required by socialist education.
    The elimination of the boundaries between mental and physical labor is indeed not a matter of a short period of time. However, there are two opposing attitudes towards this issue. One is to embark on the starting point of combining mental and physical labor and actively promote this combination. This is a far-sighted attitude that sees both the present and the future. The other attitude is to only look at the past, ignore the present, and not look at the future. They are like eyes growing on the back of their heads, only looking backward and not forward. They only see the separation of mental and physical labor but not the beginning of the combination of the two. Our Party has always attached importance to and promoted the combination of mental and physical labor. As early as the ten years of civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, organs, troops, and schools carried out mass production movements to strengthen the labor concepts of cadres. Not long ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on cadres at all levels participating in physical labor, requiring cadres at all levels to participate in physical labor to gradually combine mental and physical labor. Now schools are training laborers, and cadres are being sent down to factories and rural areas, which is a necessary step to make intellectuals workers and peasants. And eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, and carrying out technological and cultural revolutions are necessary steps to make workers and peasants intellectuals. We have now seen many workers writing books and many peasants serving as researchers at the Academy of Sciences. This situation of a great leap forward in culture shows that workers and peasants are beginning to become the masters of culture and will all become knowledgeable people. The era of treating knowledge as a monopoly property, hoarding it for speculation, and using knowledge as a bargaining chip with the people is about to pass. Of course, the complete combination of mental and physical labor must also have a strong material foundation. But where does this material foundation come from? It is precisely the result of the increasing combination of mental and physical labor. Therefore, we should promote this combination in many ways and never go backward. As for the division of labor, it depends on what kind of division of labor it is. The division of labor we are talking about is based on the increasing combination of mental and physical labor, not the division of labor that maintains the opposition between physical and mental labor. Those who say that "the combination of mental and physical labor is a distant future thing" and that "a socialist society has not yet been built, and it cannot be combined at all" are obviously wrong.
    Combining learning with political struggle and production struggle is the characteristic of socialist universities. This approach is very good and correct! A person studies from elementary school to university graduation for sixteen or seventeen years, more than just "ten years of hard study." What is the benefit of being detached from labor, detached from production, and locked in a study every day, "not hearing anything outside the window and only reading business books with all one's heart" during this long period of time? That can only cultivate some bourgeois intellectuals who climb on top of the people, and cannot create laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Confucius ran schools to train "scholars" to serve the feudal class, the bourgeoisie ran schools to train bourgeois intellectuals, and the proletariat ran schools to train laborers. Each has its own purposes and methods, which are clearly different and should not be confused. Confucius's educational views collapsed during the May Fourth Movement when "Down with the Confucius Shop" was called out. Now we must also defeat the bourgeois educational views. We believe that combining education with labor, combining theory with practice, combining mental labor with physical labor, combining intellectuals with workers and peasants, and studying and working is the correct path for socialist education. This is the regular path, and the opposite is not the regular path. The view that one must maintain the regular education of the old universities in thought is an outdated and stale concept in education and must be discarded. The young students of our generation must use their own hands to completely change the state of separation between labor and education.
    Why do young students also have incorrect views on labor? Many of them come from exploiting class families and are deeply influenced by the bourgeois ideas of despising labor and the working people; they are not used to the socialist education policy, and even have resistance. The exploiting classes' ideas of idleness and aversion to work still have a market among them. In particular, the bourgeois ideological toxins spread by some bourgeois experts and professors among young students in the past have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, in the process of combining education and labor, we will inevitably encounter various ideological obstacles, and there must be a fierce struggle. This struggle is a struggle between the two lines of bourgeois education and proletarian education, and also a struggle between two ideological systems. Only through this struggle can this contradiction be resolved, and can the red flag of proletarian education be raised high. Therefore, universities and colleges must closely combine the reform of teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and teaching content, and launch a major debate on the combination of education and labor.
    The great debate on the combination of education and labor is a concrete reflection of the struggle between two roads and two ideological systems. However, this is a struggle within the people, so we must adopt the method of unity-criticism-unity, present the facts, reason things out, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. In the debate, we must grasp the main contradictions, prevent getting stuck in the horns of a dilemma; we must debate on principle issues, connect with reality, break down concerns, boldly expose ourselves, and strive to improve our understanding.
    In the great debate on the combination of education and labor, young students must, in the spirit of conscious revolution and continuous revolution, not stop at ninety miles when walking a hundred; but must resolve ideological contradictions, turn from the conservative side to the advanced side, not hesitate and wait, but take a good stand, run to rally under the red flag of laborers, move forward, and catch up with the great leap forward pace of the great motherland where one day equals twenty years!

    到劳动者的红旗下集合
    是要做有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，还是做四体不勤、五谷不分的脱离劳动的知识分子？这是目前全国青年学生和教师在思想上要解决的重要问题。
    我们人民的教育是为政治服务、与劳动结合的。要彻底解决教育为政治服务的问题，就必须进一步解决教育和劳动结合的问题。教育为政治服务，必须通过教育和生产劳动结合而体现出来，使我们的教育事业有力地推动社会主义生产力的发展；反过来说，也只有在教育为政治服务的原则下，才能保证教育的社会主义方向，保证教育真正同生产劳动结合，为社会主义生产服务。全国高等学校在社会主义大跃进中，已经把教育和劳动结合向前推进了一步，如实行勤工俭学、半工半读、办工厂、农场，同校外工厂、农村挂钩，等等。许多学生在劳动中受到锻炼，得到提高。哈尔滨工业大学一个班的学生参加炼钢。他们的豪语是：“在为祖国炼出黑钢的同时，要把自己炼成红钢。”劳动可贵，这一观念已印入人心。许多学生不只热情地参加了勤工俭学活动，在思想上也确实解决了问题。可是，深入而全面地检查一下，就会看到教育和劳动结合的观念还没有巩固。因此还需要继续加强这个教育。
    我们要培养的劳动者，是既有高度社会主义觉悟，又有高度文化科学知识的劳动者，也就是又红又专，能文能武，能上能下，把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合在一起，把专家和劳动者，把知识分子和工人农民结合在一起的全新的人。他们投身到工厂和农村中去，同工人农民一起，去从事生产劳动，解决生产实践中提出的新课题，更好地促进生产大跃进，加速祖国的社会主义建设。那种认为工人农民只从事简单的体力劳动的看法是不正确的。在社会主义大跃进中，工人农民在生产上不断创造空前奇迹。工人创造了一个工具，一天可以做二十年的活；农民种试验田，把小麦水稻的产量提高到历史上从来没有过的亩产几千斤、几万斤的水平。这就说明，工人农民从事的是英雄豪迈的事业。要做一个有创造性的工人农民，还有待我们去努力。有一个大学生参加工厂劳动时，手把着钳子，弓背蹲腿，头向后扭，生怕碰着，工人批评他道：“这不是过春节放鞭炮！”可见，大学生不到劳动中去锻炼，连一个普通的工人农民也当不像。学习和掌握知识的最终目的，就是为了用于实践，指导实践。只有把知识交给劳动人民，同劳动结合，才能真正有所创造。解决实际问题，才能真正有益于人民，有益于国家，有益于自己。“大学生去做工人农民，做劳动者简直是浪费！”这种论调，是资产阶级把脑力劳动看作高人一等的思想的反映。做一个既懂政治又懂业务，既有知识又有经验，既能从事脑力劳动又能从事体力劳动的多面手，正是社会主义需要的人才；而做一个脱离生产，脱离实际，肩不能挑担，手不能提篮的书呆子，才是最大的浪费！我们不仅要用脑来劳动，而且要用手来劳动，这是马克思指出的一般自然规律。在阶级社会里，剥削阶级排斥这个规律；而在社会主义社会里，每个人就都必须适应和掌握这个规律，使自己成为一个劳动者。
    参加生产劳动，可以加强学生的劳动观念，丰富生产斗争知识、增强体质，对于学生的全面发展有着重大的意义。坚决贯彻教育结合劳动的青年学生，正在如火如荼，越干越起劲。在他们手下，新产品如百花齐放；在他们面前，新知识如泉水迸涌。“一个月的生产劳动，胜过读半年工艺学。”“参加劳动，同工人农民有了共同的语言。”“过去对劳动能拖就拖，能躲就躲，现在闲下来没活干就难受！”“参加劳动，觉也睡好了，药也不吃了。”学生们作出了许多达到世界水平的和超过世界水平的新产品！这些都是学生们把教育同生产劳动结合的结晶。一个大学生写诗歌颂劳动道：“若非勤工又俭学，怎能红专一齐来？”这是正确的认识；但是也有的人担忧地说：“教育和劳动结合，会降低教学质量。”事实果真是这样吗？我们要问：什么是社会主义教育所要求的质量呢？这就是培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，也就是要学生在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展。而剥削阶级则按照“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”的老秤来衡量教学质量。一些资产阶级专家、教授，认为只要学生学好书本知识，就可以送给五分，不管在劳动生产上得不得零分。这些资产阶级专家、教授教给学生们什么呢？有的水稻专家不会种水稻，有的建筑专家不会砌墙角，有的昆虫专家只研究昆虫的触角多长、每秒钟翅膀震动多少次，而对于如何防治却茫然不知。有的教授捧着几年前甚至几十年前的教本在教现在的学生。试问，在这样的书本教学中，青年学生所学到的是什么呢？即使学到一大堆这样的书本知识，也于事无补，不为实际所需要。书本知识如果不和生产劳动结合，就会变成死知识，根本谈不到什么质量。只有把它同生产劳动相结合，才会变成活的知识，才会得到全面的丰富的真才实学，才能达到社会主义教育所要求的质量。
    关于脑力劳动和体力劳动界限的消除，确实不是短时期内的事情。但是，对待这个问题，有两种相反的态度。一种是，踏上脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的起点，而且积极地促进这种结合。这是既看到现在又看到将来的有远见的态度。另一种态度是只看过去，忽视现在，不看将来。他们好似眼睛长在后脑上，只向后看，不向前看。他们只看到脑力劳动和体力劳动的分离，而看不到这两者结合已经开始。我们党一向是重视和促进脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的。远在十年内战和抗日战争时期，机关、部队、学校，都进行了群众性的生产运动，加强了干部的劳动观念。不久以前，中共中央又发出关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示，要求各级干部参加体力劳动，使脑力劳动和体力劳动逐步结合。现在学校培养劳动者，干部下放到工厂农村，是使知识分子工农化的必要步骤。而扫除文盲，普及教育，进行技术革命和文化革命，则是使工农知识分子化的必要步骤。我们现在已经看到许多工人著书立说，许多农民当科学院研究员。这种文化大跃进的形势，表明工人农民开始做文化的主人，都将成为有知识的人。把知识当作垄断财产，奇货可居，利用知识作为向人民讨价还价的时代就将过去了。当然，脑力劳动和体力劳动的彻底结合，还必须有强大的物质基础。然而这种物质基础是从哪里来的呢？也正是脑力劳动和体力劳动日益结合的结果。因此，我们应该多方面地来促进这种结合，而决不能开倒车。至于分工问题就要看是什么样的分工。我们说的分工是在脑力劳动和体力劳动日益结合的基础上的分工，而不是保持体力劳动和脑力劳动对立的分工。那些说什么“脑力劳动和体力劳动结合是遥远的未来的事”，“现在社会主义社会还没有建成，根本结合不了”等等论调，显然是错误的。
    学习同政治斗争和生产斗争相结合是社会主义大学的特色。这种作法好得很，这样做得对！一个人从小学读到大学毕业，就要十六、七年，何止“十年寒窗”，在这漫长的时间里，脱离劳动，脱离生产，天天关在书房里，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”，有什么好处呢？那只能培养一些爬在人民头上的资产阶级知识分子，而不能造就有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。孔子办学要培养为封建阶级服务的“儒者”，资产阶级办学要培养资产阶级知识分子，无产阶级办学要培养劳动者。各有各的目的和方法，分明异常，混淆不得。孔子的教育观在五四运动“打倒孔家店”的时候已经垮下去了，现在我们还要打垮资产阶级教育观。我们认为，教育和劳动结合，理论和实践结合，脑力劳动和体力劳动结合，知识分子和工农结合，又读书又劳动是社会主义教育的正确路线，这才是正规，反之，就不正规。那种思想上要保持旧大学的正规教育的观点，是教育上倒退的陈腐观念，早已过时了，必须抛弃。我们这一代的青年学生，一定要用自己的手，彻底改变劳动和教育分离的状态。
    青年学生中为什么对劳动也有不正确的看法呢？他们中间，有许多人出身于剥削阶级家庭，受到资产阶级轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的思想的深刻影响；对于社会主义的教育方针还不习惯，甚而产生抵触情绪。剥削阶级的好逸恶劳的思想，在他们之中也还有市场。特别是一些资产阶级专家、教授，过去在青年学生中间散布的资产阶级思想毒素，还没有彻底肃清。因此在教育和劳动结合的过程中，必然会碰到各种思想障碍，必须经过一场剧烈的斗争。这个斗争是资产阶级教育和无产阶级教育两条路线的斗争，也是两种思想体系的斗争。只有经过这场斗争，才能解决这个矛盾，才能把无产阶级的教育的红旗高举起来。因此，高等学校必须密切结合教学计划、教学大纲、教学内容的改革，展开关于教育和劳动结合的大辩论。
    教育和劳动结合的大辩论是两条道路、两种思想体系的斗争的具体反映。但是，这是人民内部的斗争，所以必须采取团结——批评——团结的方式，摆事实，讲道理，坚持真理，修正错误。在辩论中，要抓住主要矛盾，防止钻到牛角尖里去；要辩论原则问题，要联系实际，要破除顾虑，大胆暴露自己，也要努力提高认识。
    在教育和劳动结合的大辩论中，青年学生要本着自觉革命、不断革命的精神，不要人行百里，止于九十；而要解决思想矛盾，从保守方面转到先进方面来，不要徘徊观望，而要把队站好，跑步到劳动者的红旗下面集合，向前迈进，赶上伟大祖国一天等于二十年的大跃进步伐！
