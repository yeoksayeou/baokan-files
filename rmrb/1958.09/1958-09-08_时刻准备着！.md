Ready at All Times!

Peaceful Beijing has now become a city of anger!

Demonstrations against the U.S. imperialist military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area have been continuing since the 6th, one night and then another morning; now, under the scorching sun, millions of people are surging towards the heart of Beijing—Tiananmen Square.

Among countless bright flags, one red flag is particularly eye-catching: "Ready to Strike to Defend the Sacred Territory and Sovereignty of the Motherland!" Under the red flag, infantry, motorized infantry, armored soldiers, artillery, air force, navy, anti-aircraft artillery, paratroopers, engineers, and public security soldiers are lined up, solemnly standing, with bayonets drawn, shining coldly in the sun!

The American aggressors openly want to carry out military provocations and war threats against the great Chinese people. The hearts of the soldiers are excited and angry!

In the infantry ranks, nineteen-year-old new soldier Yang Zhongzhi tightly grips the gun in his hand. His face is red because of the heat and even more so because of excitement. He is from Gu'an County, Hebei Province, and only joined the army in January of this year. On the evening of the 6th, he was reading the news in the newspaper about the large-scale establishment of people's communes in Hebei Province, feeling happy and proud of the infinitely beautiful prospects of his hometown. Then, the radio station broadcast Premier Zhou's solemn statement. The American aggressors are coming to invade us. Yang Zhongzhi didn't sleep well all night. In the past, he always hated himself for being born too late to catch up with the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, or even the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea! Now it seems it is not too late. The American aggressors ran into a wall in the Middle East, and now they want to come and try their luck at the gate of the great People's China! Fine, he, Yang Zhongzhi, will not let down the teachings of his father and elder brothers, and will definitely let the aggressors taste the strength of this generation of heroic Chinese people! Thus, he often woke up at night, really afraid that the team had already set off without him, this new soldier. In fact, although he had not fought against the American aggressors, he knew long ago that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. There are so many veteran soldiers around him, people's heroes who beat the paper tiger to pieces.

Now, right in the ranks beside him, a pair of close comrades-in-arms—Company Commander Zhang Cheng, a captain, and Instructor Chen Qiyun, also a captain—had already competed with the American aggressors. During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the winter of 1950, they were among the first volunteers to go to Korea and only returned after the Korean armistice. They participated in the five campaigns, fighting all the way to the Han River, and then defended Kaesong, confronting the American aggressors face to face, only tens of meters apart. Just a few days before the Korean War armistice in 1953, they eliminated an American aggressor reinforced company and an artillery company with a strengthened platoon, killing and wounding more than 300 enemies and capturing three prisoners alive. Now, they are here again recalling the past, talking in low voices, and they laugh: "See, the American aggressors are just big, one shot for each, and the target is also big!" "Yes, we know their bottom line. As long as the higher-ups give an order, we will definitely eliminate them in the sea!" They despise and disdain their defeated soldiers so much.

Paratrooper Warrant Officer Li Zhong couldn't wait any longer: "Our paratroopers have been ready for a long time, just waiting for an order to move out! What is Dulles talking nonsense about? The Chinese people liberating their own territory is described as seizing new territory?! Our liberation of Kinmen and Matsu is like the liberation of Zhoushan and Hainan Island, all are recovering our territory. This time, if I can have the glorious task of liberating Kinmen and Matsu, I will definitely not hesitate to shed my blood and even contribute my life to protect the happiness and safety of the people of the motherland and liberate the compatriots who are still in deep waters!"

The heroic spirit of infinite contempt for U.S. imperialism and infinite loyalty to the socialist construction of the motherland permeates the hearts of all soldiers. Lu Xibin, an air force lieutenant colonel who has been through many battles and participated in the Long March, summarized the thoughts of all the soldiers. He said that we have such full confidence in defeating U.S. imperialism not only because we have a strong land, sea, and air fighting force, but also because we have the strong support of the 600 million people of the country, and the entire socialist camp and all peace-loving people in the world are standing on our side. The soldiers all believe that with the leadership of the beloved Party and Chairman Mao, we are invincible in the world. Chairman Mao taught us long ago: what determines the outcome of a war is people, is the nature of the war, not atomic bombs. If the American aggressors have not learned their lesson from the failure in the Korean War and still dare to compete with us, then let them go from failure to destruction! As for him, this veteran Red Army soldier himself, although he is already over forty years old and his temples are already showing white hair, he is still boldly confident: after defeating the American aggressors, he will continue to contribute his infinite strength to the cause of communism!

The meeting began. In the repeated speeches and bursts of slogans, the soldiers held up their rifles, the bayonet tips pointing straight into the sky, as if piercing the heart of the aggressors! On the sea of countless red and green small flags, a forest of glittering bayonets emerged. This is the bayonet of the invincible soldiers. Their swords and guns form a Great Wall to defend the happiness of the people of the motherland. Look, around them are workers who have just run from the steelmaking furnace, members who have just rushed from the autumn harvest fields of the people's commune, students and teachers who have just come out of laboratories and classrooms, and also the armed ranks of "everyone a soldier" composed of workers, farmers, and students... The soldiers loyally protect the safety of the people, and the people warmly support them.

"Long live the heroic People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" The demonstration began. When the soldiers' team set off, the people watched them with infinite joy and trusting eyes, and the clear voices of the Young Pioneers shouted in bursts, applauding them. The soldiers' majestic steps and high morale aroused constant praise from the crowd on the roadside: "Look! These lads are so great, each one is as lively as a dragon and tiger!" "Look! These lads can blow up the paper tiger in one breath!"

The powerful people's soldiers, the rolling iron torrent, marched forward with their heads held high in the cheers and praises of the crowd!

　　时刻准备着！
    和平的北京现在已经成了愤怒的城市！
    反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅的示威游行从6日起已经连续了一个夜晚又一个早晨；现在，烈日当空，成百万的队伍又向着北京的心脏——天安门涌来。
    在无数面鲜明的旗帜中间，一面红旗特别耀眼：“为保卫祖国的神圣领土和主权—待命出击！”红旗下，步兵、摩托步兵、装甲兵、炮兵、空军、海军、高射炮兵、空降兵、工兵和公安兵各各列队，森然肃立，刺刀出鞘，在烈日下闪着寒光！
    美国侵略者公然要对伟大的中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，战士们的心激动了，愤怒了！
    在步兵行列里，十九岁的新战士杨忠智紧握着手中的枪，他的脸因为天热，更因为激动而显得通红。他是河北省固安县人，今年1月才参军。6日晚，他读着报上登载的河北省大建人民公社的消息，正为着家乡无限美好的远景而感到幸福和骄傲，接着，广播电台传出了周总理庄严的声明。美国侵略者要来侵犯咱们。杨忠智一夜没有好睡，以前他总恨自己生得太迟，赶不上抗日战争，赶不上解放战争，连抗美援朝战争也没有赶得上！现在看来并不太迟。美国侵略者在中东碰了一起，现在又要到伟大的人民中国大门口来碰一碰！好吧，他，杨忠智不会辜负父兄一辈的教诲，一定要让侵略者尝一尝中国这一代英雄人民的好歹！就这样，夜里他时常醒来，真怕队伍全出发了，没有带上他这个新战士。其实，他虽则没有和美国侵略者交过仗，但他早知道美帝国主义是个纸老虎，他周围有多少身经百战的老战士，就是把纸老虎打得落花流水的人民英雄。
    如今，就在他身旁的行列里，一对亲密的战友——连长张诚上尉和指导员陈起云上尉早就和美国侵略者较量过。1950年冬抗美援朝战争时，他们头一批志愿去朝鲜，一直到朝鲜停战以后才回来。他们参加了五次战役，一直打到汉江边上，以后又保卫开城，和美国侵略者面对面对峙着，相距不过几十公尺。就在1953年朝鲜战争停战前几天，他们一个加强排就消灭了美国侵略者一个加强连和一个炮兵连，打死打伤敌人三百多人，还活捉了三个俘虏。现在，他们在这里又回忆起往事，低声地交谈着，他们笑起来了：“你看怎样，美国侵略者就是个儿大，上来一枪一个，目标也大！”“是啊，我们知道它的底，只要上级一声命令，我们一定要把它消灭在海里！”他们是那样地蔑视鄙视着自己手下的残兵败将。
    空降兵准尉李忠早就急不可耐了：“我们空降兵早就准备好了，只等一声令下，我们就出动！杜勒斯在胡说些什么，中国人民解放自己的领土，倒说成是什么夺取新的领土？！我们解放金门、马祖，就如解放舟山和海南岛一样，都是收复国土。这次，如果能让我有解放金门、马祖这种光荣任务的话，我一定毫不犹豫流出我的鲜血以至贡献我的生命，保卫祖国人民的幸福和安全，解放还在水深火热中的同胞！”
    对于美帝国主义的无限蔑视，对于祖国社会主义建设无限忠诚的英雄气概，洋溢在所有战士的心间，身经百战，参加过长征的空军中校吕锡彬总结了所有战士的思想，他说，我们对战胜美帝国主义有这样充分的信心，不仅是我们有着强大的陆海空战斗行列，还有着全国六亿人民的坚强支援，而且整个社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民都站在我们一边。战士们都相信，有了亲爱的党和毛主席的领导，我们是无敌于天下的。毛主席早就教导过我们：决定战争胜负的是人，是战争的性质，而不是什么原子弹，美国侵略者如果还没有从朝鲜战争的失败中取得教训，还敢来和我们较量的话，那就让它由失败走向灭亡！至于他，这位老红军自己，虽则已经四十多岁，两鬓已经微露白发，但他还豪迈地自信：打完美国侵略者还要为共产主义事业继续贡献自己的无穷力量！
    大会开始了，在一次次的讲演和一阵阵的口号声中，战士高举步枪，刀尖直刺天空，仿佛刺向侵略者的心脏！在无数面红绿小旗起伏着的海洋上，涌现着一片寒光闪闪的刺刀的森林。这是无敌战士的刺刀。他们的刀枪列成了捍卫祖国人民幸福的长城。看，在他们周围，是刚从炼铁炉旁跑来的工人，是刚从人民公社秋收地里赶来的社员，是刚从实验室和教室里出来的学生和教员，也有着工人、农民、学生组成的“全民皆兵”的武装行列……战士忠心保卫着人民的安全，人民热烈地支援着他们。
    “英勇的人民解放军万岁！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”示威游行开始了，当战士的队伍出发，人民以无限喜悦、信赖的眼光注视着他们，红领巾们的清脆的声音一阵阵喊着，向他们鼓掌。战士们雄壮的步伐，高昂的士气，引起了路旁人群不绝地赞扬：“看！这些小伙子多棒，一个个生龙活虎般！”“看！这些小伙子能把纸老虎一口气吹破！”
    强大的人民子弟兵，那滚滚的铁流，就在人群的欢呼和赞扬声里昂首阔步地前进，前进！
