　　U.S. Imperialism is the Common Enemy of Mankind
　　All Countries' People Stand With Us
　　Many Countries' People's Organizations Express Support for the Chinese People's Struggle
　　African People's Union Expresses:
　　African People Support Chinese People in Recovering Territory
　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th - The African People's Union sent a telegram to Chen Jiakang, the Chinese ambassador to the United Arab Republic, expressing support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate China's territory, Taiwan and the coastal islands.
　　The telegram, signed by the Union's Secretary-General, Abdul Aziz Ishaq, stated that "The people of the African continent support the great Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism to recover occupied territories." The telegram expressed strong belief that the struggle of the Asian and African people will surely be victorious.
　　Arab-China Friendship Association Issues Statement
　　Oppressed People Ready to Fully Defend China
　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th - The Arab-China Friendship Association issued a statement on the 6th, calling on all peace-loving countries in the world to unite and protest against the United States' acts of aggression against the People's China.
　　The statement said that the Arab-China Friendship Association sincerely further suggests that all free countries in the world loudly unite to protest and condemn the recent actions of aggression and infringement upon the legitimate rights of the great China in the Far East. The great China is a country with a long history of culture, has always made positive contributions to world peace, and has always advocated peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems.
　　The statement pointed out that the United States, under the guise of anti-communism, constantly uses force to interfere with or threaten national independence movements. It uses the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, transports weapons and pilots to support Indonesian rebels, and directly interferes in Indonesia's internal affairs. Not long ago, the United States, under the pretext of opposing "indirect aggression," sent troops to invade Lebanon, thousands of miles away from the United States, and still refuses to withdraw its troops. These acts of aggression are nothing more than the "policy objectives" of the United States in the Far East and Asia.
　　The statement continued that the United States, under the pretext of anti-communism, has long occupied South Korea and South Vietnam, turning them into colonies. It also organized the Baghdad Pact under the pretext of anti-communism.
　　The statement pointed out that those mad leaders of U.S. imperialism should know that the great China is by no means isolated in opposing their barbaric colonial policies. Hundreds of millions of people of different faiths and nationalities have established genuine, active friendship and cooperation with socialist China. In addition to a number of countries having established diplomatic relations or concluded friendship agreements with the great and humane People's Republic of China, the oppressed countries and peoples of the world regard China as their most loyal friend. The facts have indeed proved to these countries and nations that China and other socialist countries are the most determined supporters of their struggle for independence and freedom. Therefore, it is no wonder that these countries, nations, and people are ready to sacrifice everything in their power to defend the territory and other legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, so that they are free from the barbaric invasion and aggression of the United States or any other imperialist country in the world.
　　Syrian-China Friendship Association Condemns U.S. Provocation
　　The Chinese People's Struggle Will Surely Be Victorious
　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th - The Syrian-China Friendship Association sent a telegram to the United Nations on the 6th, condemning the United States' provocations against China.
　　The telegram said: "We are indignant and hateful at all the provocations of the United States and the threats of atomic war, because this endangers world peace. We are fully convinced that the great Chinese people will be victorious in their struggle for liberation and unification, because all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world stand firmly with them."
　　The telegram also said: "The victory of the Chinese people in liberating their own territory is the victory of all liberation movements, because the struggle for freedom and against imperialism, whether in the Far East, in the Middle East, or anywhere else, is inseparable."
　　The telegram was signed by Bakuri, Chairman of the Arab-China Friendship Association and Minister of Religious Foundations of the United Arab Republic, Zirkli, Secretary-General of the Syrian-China Friendship Association, Fadl Qadri, Deputy Secretary-General, and Ali Buzzo, head of the Syrian parliamentary delegation that visited China, and Adnan Kuatli, head of the Syrian legal workers delegation that visited China.
　　British and Italian Peace Organizations Issue Statements
　　U.S. Provocations Against China Seriously Endanger Peace
　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th - The British Peace Committee issued a statement last night, accusing the United States' war provocations in the Taiwan Strait of "seriously endangering peace."
　　The statement pointed out that the United States' concentration of a large number of warships and aircraft in the Taiwan Strait is seriously endangering peace.
　　The statement called on the British government to sever its military and diplomatic support for Chiang Kai-shek's policies and to work to restore China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.
　　The statement demanded that the British government refuse to act as an accomplice to the United States when it engages in military action to support Chiang Kai-shek and oppose China.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th - Tass News Agency, Rome, 7th: The Secretariat of the Italian National Peace Council issued a statement emphasizing that U.S. imperialism's provocations against the People's Republic of China once again threaten world peace. "The events in the Far East once again show that if China is not recognized and is still deprived of its legitimate seat in the United Nations and the Security Council, despite the demands of representatives from all countries at the Stockholm Peace Conference, peace in the Far East cannot be maintained."
　　The statement continued, "No ideological prejudice should belittle the rights of 600 million people; there is no reason to justify supporting imperialist provocative forces."
　　The Italian National Peace Council therefore demands that "the Italian government immediately recognize People's China, thereby promoting the consolidation of the cause of peace."

　　美帝国主义是人类公敌

　　许多国家人民团体表示支持中国人民斗争
    非洲人联盟表示
    非洲人民支持中国人民收复领土
    新华社开罗7日电　非洲人联盟致电中国驻阿拉伯联合共和国大使陈家康，表示支持中国人民解放中国的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争。
    由这个联盟的总书记阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹·伊沙克签署的电报说，“非洲大陆人民支持伟大的中国人民为收复被占领的领土而同美帝国主义进行的斗争。”电报表示坚信亚非人民的斗争定将取得胜利。
    阿中友协发表声明
    被压迫的人民准备全力保卫中国
    新华社开罗8日电　阿拉伯—中国友好协会6日发表声明，呼吁全世界爱好和平的国家联合起来抗议美国对人民中国的侵略行动。
    声明说，阿拉伯—中国友好协会真诚地进一步建议全世界各自由国家大声联合抗议，谴责最近在远东侵略和侵犯伟大的中国的合法权利的行动。伟大的中国是文化悠久的国家，一直对世界和平作出积极的贡献，一直主张在不同社会制度的国家之间实行和平共处和和平竞赛。
    声明指出，美国在反共的幌子下，不断使用武力干涉或威胁民族独立运动。它利用台湾蒋介石集团卖国贼，运送武器和飞行员去支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子，直接干涉印度尼西亚的内政。不久以前，美国借口反对“间接侵略”，派遣军队侵入离美国几千英里的黎巴嫩，并且目前仍然拒绝撤军。这些侵略兽行都不过是美国在远东和亚洲的“政策目标”。
    声明继续指出，美国借口反共，长时期霸占南朝鲜和南越，把它们变为殖民地。它还借口反共，组织巴格达条约。
    声明指出，现在美帝国主义的那些疯狂的头子应当知道，在反对他们的殖民地的野蛮政策方面，伟大的中国决不是孤立的。不同信仰和国籍的亿万人民已经同社会主义的中国建立了真正的积极的友谊和合作。除了若干国家已经同伟大的人道的中华人民共和国建立外交关系或者缔结友好协定以外，全世界受压迫的国家和人民都把中国当作它们最忠实的朋友。事实也的确向这些国家和民族证明，中国及其他社会主义国家是他们争取独立和自由的斗争的最坚决的支持者。因此难怪这些国家、民族和人民随时准备牺牲他们力所能及的一切来保卫中华人民共和国的领土和其他合法权利，使它们不受美国或世界上其他任何帝国主义国家的野蛮的侵犯和侵略。
    叙中友协谴责美国挑衅
    中国人民的斗争一定会取得胜利
    新华社大马士革7日电　叙利亚—中国友好协会在6日打电报给联合国，谴责美国对中国的挑衅。
    电报说：“我们对于美国的一切挑衅和关于进行原子战争的威胁都感到愤慨憎恨，因为这是危及世界和平的，我们完全相信伟大的中国人民在他们争取解放和统一的斗争中会取得胜利，因为全世界的一切爱好和平和自由的人民都坚决地同他们站在一起。”
    电报还说：“中国人民解放自己领土的胜利就是一切解放运动的胜利，因为争取自由、反对帝国主义的斗争，不管是在远东，在中东还是在任何其他地方，都是不可分开的。”
    在电报上签名的有阿拉伯—中国友好协会主席、阿拉伯联合共和国宗教基金部长巴库里，叙利亚—中国友好协会秘书长齐尔克利、副秘书长法德·卡德里，以及访问过中国的叙利亚议会代表团团长阿里·布佐、访问过中国的叙利亚法律工作者代表团团长阿德南·库阿特利等。
    英意和平组织发表声明
    美国对中国挑衅严重危害和平
    新华社伦敦7日电　英国和平委员会昨晚发表声明，指责美国在台湾海峡的战争挑衅行动“严重地危及和平”。
    声明指出，美国在台湾海峡集中大批军舰和飞机的做法是严重危及和平的。
    声明呼吁英国政府赶紧同美国的在军事上和外交上支持蒋介石的政策断绝关系，并且努力使中国恢复在联合国的合法席位。
    声明要求英国政府在美国投入支持蒋介石、反对中国的军事行动的时候，拒绝作美国帮凶。
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社罗马7日讯：意大利全国和平理事会书记处发表声明强调指出，美国帝国主义对中华人民共和国的挑衅再一次使世界和平受到威胁。“远东所发生的事件再一次表明，如果不承认中国，并且不顾斯德哥尔摩和平大会各国代表的要求，仍然剥夺中国在联合国和安全理事会的合法席位，远东地区的和平就无法保持。”
    声明接着说，“任何意识形态上的偏见都不应轻视六亿人民的权利；没有任何理由可以为支持帝国主义挑衅势力辩解。”
    意大利全国和平理事会为此要求“意大利政府立即承认人民中国，从而促进和平事业的巩固。”
