　　High-Yield Secrets of the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant
　　By our reporter Tang Ying
　　The Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant in Funing County, Hebei Province, famous for creating "Funing-style" small blast furnaces, recently launched two high-yield "satellites" in a row. In early August, the No. 1 small blast furnace exceeded its design capacity, with a daily output of 7.2 tons. Soon after, the No. 2 small blast furnace surpassed it again, reaching a daily output of 7.98 tons. The output of these two small blast furnaces is one to two times higher than the daily output of Funing-style small blast furnaces in many areas of Hebei Province, making them the red banner of small blast furnaces in the province. From August 20th to 24th, relevant departments in Hebei Province held an on-site meeting at this plant to summarize and promote their experience in normal production and creating high yields.

　　How exactly did they create such high yields?

　　The No. 1 and No. 2 small blast furnaces of the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant were put into production in January and July of this year, respectively. When they were first put into production, their output was not high. Since the No. 1 blast furnace was put into production in January, its daily output has remained at around four tons, and sometimes even dropped below three tons.

　　How to further increase output? Finding ways to increase hot blast temperature was a key issue.

　　Usually when people cook rice, if the fire in the stove is burning strongly, the rice will heat up quickly and smell particularly fragrant when cooked. Iron smelting is the same. If the hot blast temperature can be increased, the combustion inside the blast furnace will be strengthened, increasing the temperature inside the furnace, which will not only increase output but also improve the quality of pig iron.

　　The workers of the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant had tried many times to increase the hot blast temperature of the hot blast stove, but the first few times did not achieve the expected results. Once the hot blast temperature was increased, but the hot blast pipe was melted and deformed. At this time, some people with conservative ideas said: "The semi-native, semi-foreign small blast furnace does not have the advanced equipment of a fully foreign large blast furnace, and the wind temperature cannot be further increased." Their conclusion was: "Small blast furnaces are inherently low-yield crops."

　　However, the daring and capable workers did not give up their efforts to continue increasing wind temperature because of this. In July, the Party branch of the plant specifically held a meeting to determine the establishment of a high-yield experimental plot in the No. 1 furnace, and a core team with worker participation was established to lead the broad masses of workers in finding ways to increase output.

　　Once, an accident occurred in a small blast furnace at the Qinhuangdao Municipal Commercial Bureau Iron Smelting Plant. Xu Zhaolun, the "native expert" of the Duzhuang Iron Smelting Plant – the director of the workshop – was invited to treat the furnace. In the process of handling the accident, he discovered that this furnace had a great advantage: because the piping in the hot blast chamber was installed reasonably, although the hot blast temperature was very high, the hot blast pipe was not burned. After Xu Zhaolun returned to the factory, he immediately worked with the workers to study the experience of the Qinhuangdao Commercial Bureau Iron Smelting Plant and improved the defects in the plant's equipment. They first changed the diameter of the hot blast pipe from 250 mm to 150 mm, and the thickness of the pipe wall from 30 mm to 15 to 20 mm, so that the pipe could transfer heat quickly and have a high temperature. At the same time, the original single-pipe series connection method was changed to a multi-pipe parallel connection method. The number of straight pipes was increased from 32 to 48, and the length of the pipes was increased from 40 meters to 120 meters. This not only greatly increased the heat-receiving area of the wind, but also increased the heat-receiving time by nearly two times due to the increase in the length of the pipes. In the past, there was only one gas burner, which directly hit the hot blast pipe. When the gas was burned, the temperature often reached 1200 degrees Celsius, which melted and deformed the cast iron hot blast pipe. Now, they have increased the number of gas burners to two, and the longitudinal depth of the combustion chamber has therefore been increased from 700 mm to 850 mm, making the gas burn more evenly and providing more heat.

　　After this equipment was rebuilt, the wind temperature in the hot blast chamber quickly rose from 400 degrees to 600 degrees, effectively enhancing the ability to melt ore and significantly increasing output.

　　Increasing air volume is as important as increasing wind temperature. If the wind temperature remains the same, the greater the air volume, the better the coke in the blast furnace will burn, which can increase smelting intensity and achieve the same effect of increasing output.

　　In the past, the air volume of the plant's blast furnace was small, mainly because the speed of the locomotive boiler was low. The factory leaders had also asked the workers to speed up the engine, but the air volume had not increased significantly. Later, the Party branch secretary personally went to the locomotive boiler room and worked with the drivers to understand the crux of the problem: because the workers were not skilled in technical operations, they were afraid of running the engine at full power and being held responsible for accidents, so they did not dare to speed up the engine frequently. With the help and encouragement of the Party branch secretary, the workers liberated their thinking, strengthened their courage, and strengthened the maintenance of the machine, so that the number of revolutions of the locomotive boiler was increased from 220 revolutions per minute to 330 revolutions per minute, which significantly increased the blast volume. They also improved the joint method of the air supply pipe. The original pipe joint adopted the flange connection method, because the interface was not tight, and there was a lot of air leakage. After adopting the chemical rust connection method, the problem of air leakage was solved. This greatly shortened the smelting time, and the charging speed increased from 4 to 5 batches per hour to 10 batches.

　　Some workers do not pay attention to the management of raw materials. Raw materials often have impurities such as ash and soil mixed in, the amount of charging is not accurate, and the average iron content of the ore is unstable; the coke is sometimes very wet, and the particle size is not uniform, causing the temperature inside the furnace to fluctuate frequently, resulting in abnormal production. The situation in the No. 2 furnace is the opposite. Although this furnace has only been in production for more than a month, and the workers' operations are not yet skilled, they have paid attention to strengthening the management of raw materials based on the experience of the No. 1 furnace in increasing output. Before raw materials such as ore and coke are put into the furnace, they must be screened to prevent impurities such as ash and soil from entering the furnace. Each charge must also be weighed and made to have a uniform particle size. This not only ensures good air permeability inside the furnace but also makes the ore easy to be heated and reduced.

　　While strengthening the management of raw materials, the workers in the No. 2 furnace also paid attention to the study of the performance of iron ore. The mine here is magnetite, which generally contains more silicon dioxide. In order to meet the requirements of desulfurization for refining gray pig iron, the melting point and alkalinity of the slag must be increased, and the amount of limestone used must be relatively increased. Less than half a month after they took these measures, the daily output increased from around three tons to 7.98 tons, exceeding the output of the No. 1 furnace.

　　Now, under the slogan of "Striving for high output and striving for first place," the workers of the No. 1 and No. 2 small blast furnaces of this plant are further strengthening technical management, implementing graded treatment of raw materials, graded charging into the furnace, and striving to improve the level of operating technology to give full play to the potential of the equipment. They have proposed to increase the daily output to nine tons in September and strive for ten tons.

　　杜庄炼铁厂的高产窍门
　　本报记者　唐荧
    以创建“抚宁式”小高炉闻名的河北省抚宁县杜庄炼铁厂，最近一连放出了两颗高产“卫星”。8月初，一号小高炉，超过设计能力，日产量达到七点二吨；不久，二号小高炉又超过它，日产量达到了七点九八吨。这两座小高炉的产量，比目前河北省许多地区的抚宁式小高炉的日产量高出一至二倍，成为全省小高炉的红旗。8月20日到24日，河北省有关部门在这个厂召开了现场会议，总结和推广了他们正常生产和创造高产量的经验。
    他们究竟是怎样创造高产成绩的呢？
    杜庄炼铁厂一、二号小高炉是分别在今年1月和7月投入生产的。刚刚投入生产，它们的产量也不高。一号高炉从1月份投入生产以来，日产量一直停留在四吨左右，有时还要下降到三吨以下。
    如何进一步提高产量？设法提高热风温度是一个关键问题。
    平常人们煮饭的时候，如果炉灶内的火烧的旺，饭就热得快，而且烧出饭来格外香。炼铁也是如此。如果能使热风温度提高，高炉内的燃烧加强，增加了炉内的温度，便不仅可以提高产量，还可以提高生铁的质量。
    杜庄炼铁厂的职工曾多次设法提高热风炉的热风温度，但是开始几次都没有达到预期的效果。有一次热风温度提高了，但是热风管却被烧融变了形。这时候，有保守思想的人便说：“半土半洋的小高炉，没有全洋的大高炉设备先进，风温不可能再提高”。他们的结论是：“小高炉天生就是低产作物”。
    但是，敢想敢干的职工们，并没有因此而放弃继续提高风温的努力。7月份，这个厂的党支部专门召开了会议，确定在一号炉搞高产试验田，并且成立了一个有工人参加的核心小组，来领导广大职工设法提高产量。
    有一次，秦皇岛市商业局炼铁厂的一座小高炉发生了事故。杜庄炼铁厂的“土专家”——车间主任许兆伦被请去给这个炉子治病。他在处理事故的过程中，发现这座炉子有一个很大的优点：由于热风室的管道安装得合理，虽然热风温度很高，却没有烧坏热风管。许兆伦回厂以后，马上跟工人一起研究，根据秦皇岛商业局炼铁厂的经验，对本厂设备上的缺陷作了改进。他们首先把热风管的口径由二百五十公厘改为一百五十公厘，管壁的厚度由三十公厘改为十五到二十公厘，作到管子传热快，温度高。同时，把原来的单管串连法改为多管并连法，直管由过去的三十二根增加到四十八根，管子的长度由四十公尺增加到一百二十公尺。这样，不仅大大地增加了风的受热面积，还由于管道的增长，比过去增加了近两倍的受热时间。过去，煤气燃烧嘴只有一个，直接冲向热风管，煤气燃烧时，温度常常达到摄氏一千二百度，把铸铁热风管烧融变形。现在，他们煤气燃烧嘴增加到两个，燃烧室的纵深长度因此由七百公厘增加到八百五十公厘，使煤气燃烧得更均匀，提供更多的热量。
    这样改建设备以后，热风室的风温很快由四百度上升到六百度，有效地增强了熔化矿石的能力，产量显著地提高了。
    提高风量像提高风温一样重要。在风温不变的情况下，风量越大，高炉内的焦炭燃烧得越好，能够提高冶炼强度，同样获得提高产量的效果。
    过去，这个厂高炉的风量小，主要原因是锅驼机的转速低。工厂的领导人员也曾经让工人加快转速，但是风量还没有显著增加。后来，党支部书记亲自到锅驼机房，跟司机一块劳动，才了解到问题的症结：由于工人技术操作不熟练，怕开足了马力，出了事故负不起责任，所以不敢经常加快转速。在党支书的帮助和鼓舞下，工人们解放了思想，壮大了胆量，加强了机器的维护，使锅驼机的转数由每分钟二百二十转提高到三百三十转，结果显著地提高了鼓风量。他们还改进了送风管的接头方法。原来的管道接头是采用法兰盘联结法，因为接口不严密，跑风很多。采用化学锈接法以后，跑风的问题解决了。这样便大大缩短了冶炼时间，下料速度由每小时四至五批，增加到十批。
    有些工人不注意对原料的管理。原料经常有灰土等杂质混入，下料数量不准，矿石含铁平均品位不稳定；焦炭有时很湿，而且粒度不均匀，造成炉内温度经常波动。结果生产不正常。二号炉的情况相反。这座炉虽然投入生产才一个多月，工人的操作还不熟练，但是他们根据一号炉提高产量的经验，注意加强了原料管理。矿石、焦炭等原料在入炉以前，都要坚持过筛，不让灰土等杂质进入炉内。每次上料还要过称，并作到粒度均匀。这样，既能使炉内透气性良好，又使矿石易于受热还原。
    在加强原料管理的同时，二号炉的工人还注意了对铁矿石性能的研究。这里是矿磁铁矿，一般含二氧化矽较多。为了满足炼灰生铁脱硫的要求，必须使渣的熔点及碱度提高，相对地增加石灰石的用量。他们采取这些措施以后不到半个月，日产量就由三吨上下提高到七点九八吨，超过了一号炉的产量。
    现在，这个厂的一、二号小高炉的职工们，正在“力争高产量，力争第一”的口号下，进一步加强技术管理，对原料实行分级处理，分级入炉，努力提高操作技术水平，充分发挥设备的潜力。他们提出，要在9月份使日产量达到九吨，争取十吨。
