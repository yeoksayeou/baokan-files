The combat multiple events are a central event in this Friendly Army Games that can demonstrate the combat training level of athletes. Since every country must participate, it is one of the events with the most points awarded for the team championship, and it has a great impact on the overall team championship standings of the sports games. All countries have selected excellent athletes to participate. Moreover, with 40 to 50 people participating from each country, this is also the competition with the largest number of participants in this sports games.

This sport includes three events: obstacle course, grenade throwing accuracy, and small-bore rifle shooting. The obstacle course consists of many obstacles such as barbed wire, low walls, and trenches set on a 200-meter long field. The target for grenade throwing is 30 meters away from the throwing point, and each person throws three times, with a full score of 24 points.

When Han Guishan finished the competition, the VIP of the sports games, the world-renowned long-distance runner, Lieutenant Colonel Zatopek of the Czechoslovak People's Army, warmly congratulated Han Guishan and took a photo with him.

After achieving excellent results, Han Guishan told reporters, "I strive for this achievement not for myself personally, but for the honor of the Party and the country. In the old society, I was a hired peasant, and I only turned over when the Communist Party of China led the peasants in land reform. By now, I have been in the army for ten years." He then said: "If the American imperialists dare to prevent us from liberating Taiwan and impose war on the Chinese people, I will definitely use the military skills taught to me by the Party to join my comrades in giving the invaders a devastating blow."

    友军运动会中我运动员续创优异成绩
    韩贵山获战斗性多项运动冠军
    周连立获得一一○公尺高栏第一名
    新华社来比锡28日电  本社记者刘桂梁、沈一鸣报道，根据27日夜间宣布的战斗性多项运动比赛最后计分结果，我国田径运动员韩贵山少尉以总分一千六百三十八点五的优异成绩获得了冠军。
    战斗性多项运动是这次友军运动会中可以表现出运动员战斗训练水平的一个中心项目。由于每一个国家都必须参加，因此它是团体冠军得分最多的项目之一，对评定运动大会团体总冠军的影响极大，各国都选出了优秀运动员参加。而且由于每一个国家都有四十到五十人参加，这也是这次运动会中参加人数最多的一项比赛。
    这项运动一共包括三个项目：通过障碍地带、手榴弹投准和小口径步枪射击。障碍地带由设在二百公尺长的场地上的铁丝网、矮墙、堑壕等许多障碍物组成。手榴弹投掷目标距投弹处三十公尺，每人投三次，满分二十四分。小口径步枪一百公尺射击满分是一百环。
    韩贵山是在26日下午带病参加这项比赛的。他的通过障碍地带的成绩是五十六点八秒，投弹成绩是十九分，射击成绩是七十八环。这三项的总分超过了在这以前几天中各国运动员的成绩，当时就引起了注意。在韩贵山比赛完了的时候，运动大会的贵宾、世界著名长跑运动家、捷克斯洛伐克人民军的查托皮克中校热情地向韩贵山祝贺，并和韩贵山一起照了像。
    韩贵山在创造了优异成绩以后对记者说，我争取这项成绩并不是为了我个人，而是为了党和国家的荣誉。我过去在旧社会是一个雇农，在中国共产党领导农民进行土地改革时才翻了身。到现在，我参军已有十年了。他接着说：“如果美帝国主义者胆敢阻止我们解放台湾而把战争强加在中国人民头上，我一定要运用党所教给我的军事技术同战友们一道给侵略者以毁灭性的打击”。
    新华社来比锡27日电  中国运动健将周连立今天下午在友军运动大会田径决赛中以十四秒六的成绩获得一百一十公尺高栏冠军，这是我国军队体育代表团在参加友军运动大会以来所获得的第一枚金质奖章。他的这一成绩打破了他自己创造的十四秒八的全国纪录。
