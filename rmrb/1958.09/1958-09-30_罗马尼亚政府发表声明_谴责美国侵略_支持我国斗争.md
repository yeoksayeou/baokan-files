Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, September 29th - The Romanian government today issued a statement condemning the aggression of American imperialists against China and supporting the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

The statement said that the Romanian government and people are watching the development of the situation in the Far East with unease, and believe that the actions of the United States against the People's Republic of China are not only a serious threat to peace in the Far East, but also a serious threat to world peace. The statement accused the American aggressors of continuing to violate China's territorial waters and airspace, regardless of China's repeated warnings and the protests of many countries and world opinion. In the Sino-US ambassadorial talks in Warsaw, the United States put forward various unacceptable proposals that hindered the progress of the talks. At the same time, the United States continues to send military forces and atomic weapons to Taiwan.

The Romanian government firmly opposes the provocations of the United States against China, and believes that all governments have a responsibility to demand an immediate halt to such acts of aggression and the withdrawal of American armed forces from the Taiwan region. The statement concluded by saying that the Romanian government and people believe that the liberation of its territories of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands and other islands by the People's Republic of China is an internal affair of the Chinese people. The Romanian People's Republic fully supports the sacred struggle of the People's Republic of China to defend its national security and territorial integrity.

    据新华社布加勒斯特29日电  罗马尼亚政府今天发表声明，谴责美国帝国主义者对中国的侵略，支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的正义斗争。
