(Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, 2nd) The county town of Dingxiang, east of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, was once again recovered by the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army on the 29th of last month. The Yan's army entrenched in the city retreated to Xin County. Yan Xishan attempted to use Dingxiang as a springboard from Xin County to Mount Wutai and repeatedly invaded the city. After being first occupied by the Yan's army at the end of October last year, it was recovered by the Eighth Route Army in mid-November. Soon after, it was occupied by the Yan's army again, and this is the second time it has been liberated.

(Our Newspaper, Taiyue Front, 2nd) As the Yan's army in western Shanxi collapsed across the board, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army launched a swift counterattack against the city of Lingshi on the Tongpu Line in central Shanxi. After seven hours of fierce fighting, the city was liberated again at 7:00 AM on the 30th. Most of the Yan's army's Sixth Security Regiment was annihilated. According to preliminary statistics, over six hundred enemies were killed or wounded, and nine hundred and ninety enemy personnel, including Guan Zhaoyuan, the deputy commander of the Sixth Security Regiment, were captured alive. The army seized two mortars, over ten small cannons, over twenty machine guns, over two hundred rifles, over thirty thousand rounds of ammunition, one radio station, over ten telephones, twenty-three mules and horses, and many other military supplies, which are currently being inventoried.

(Xinhua News Agency, Luliang Front, 2nd) The Yan's army, reinforced by five regiments to coordinate with parts of the 71st and 46th Divisions, again invaded the Luliang Liberated Area. The army was intercepted by the Eighth Route Army at Zhongjie, Baijiabao, and Beixinwu, thirty miles northwest of Jiexiu, and was unable to advance. On the 29th of last month, under the cover of aircraft, they retreated eastward. Currently, except for the periphery of Fenyang city, there are no traces of the Yan's army on the 150-mile-long plains north and south along the west bank of the Fen River.

    【新华社同蒲前线二日电】同蒲铁路北段东侧之定襄县城已于上月二十九日为晋绥八路军再次收复，盘踞该城阎军退回忻县。阎锡山欲以定襄作为忻县至五台的跳板，曾屡次侵夺该城，自去年十月底被阎军第一次侵占后，十一月中旬即为八路军收复，不久又被阎军侵占，此次乃再度光复。
    【本报太岳前线二日电】当晋西阎军全线崩溃之际，太岳八路军以神速动作反击晋中同蒲线上之灵石城，经七小时激战，于三十日晨七时将该城再度解放，阎军保六团大部被歼。据初步统计，毙伤敌六人，生俘保六团副团长关朝元以下九百九十余人，缴迫击炮二门，小炮十余门，机枪二十余挺，步枪二百余枝，子弹三万余发，电台一部，电话机十余部，骡马二十三头，其他军用品甚多，正清查中。
    【新华社吕梁前线二日电】由同蒲路增援五个团配合七十一师、四十六师各一部再犯吕梁解放区之阎军，被八路军阻击于介休西北三十里中街及白家堡、北辛武一线，无法进展，乃于上月二十九日借飞机掩护向东退却。现汾河西岸除汾阳城周外，南北一百五十里平原上已无阎军踪迹。
