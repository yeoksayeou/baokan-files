　　[Our Newspaper's Report] In Zhao Village, an old liberated area in Wu'an, after a month of meticulous distribution of the fruits of victory, equal distribution has now been achieved. The following is a report on the distribution process: After the movement to cut off the "tails" of landlords last winter, village cadres generally did not pay attention to land distribution, feeling that after several years of rent reduction and anti-rent, everyone had land to cultivate, so they just casually distributed the remaining few hectares of land. Only the distribution of other properties was considered important. However, after the distribution of miscellaneous items, an inspection revealed that many land issues remained. The land varied in distance from the village, and in fertility. Distant fields, five or six *li* away, could only be fertilized twice a day, while fields close to the village could be fertilized twenty or thirty times a day. Fertile land could yield three *shi* (small *shi*) per *mu*, while barren land could only yield two or three *dou* per *mu*. Some households had land that was both close and good, while others had land that was both distant and poor. The cadres thought this was unavoidable, and planned to distribute roughly three or four *mu* per person to equalize things. Some households, with two *mu* of good, close land yielding three *shi* per person, would be given another *mu* of similar quality to reach three *mu* total; while others, with eight *mu* of land yielding only a little over two small *shi* per person, were deemed to be fine. During the distribution, priority was given to the 170 households of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs, but after only 160 households were filled, there was no more close land left. Some of the military dependents originally had very good land, yielding over ten *shi* per person, and they even exchanged their few poor *mu* for good land. The general poor peasants were dissatisfied, creating opposition to the military dependents. Later, the leadership and the appraisal committee jointly discussed and unanimously decided to change this land distribution method. The total land yield of the entire village was calculated, and it was determined that each person could have a little over five *shi*. The method of distribution was then implemented based on yield, with military dependents not exceeding about six *shi* per person, and general land recipients not receiving less than about five *shi*. At the same time, a call was made to village cadres and activists who had obtained more and better land in the rent reduction and anti-rent movement (either recovered or bought back cheaply) to voluntarily relinquish some of it to help their poor brothers and sisters to turn over a new leaf. Li Bugui, the manager of the cooperative, and the militia captain were the first to respond, giving up more than ten *mu* of good land. Xue Changlin's family, a military dependent, also voluntarily gave up more than six *mu*. Subsequently, several activists and newly liberated households who had obtained more land voluntarily relinquished land, totaling more than one *qing* of medium-quality land. After more than ten days of meticulous distribution, as decided by the masses, on the one hand, distribution was based on yield, and on the other hand, appropriate adjustments were made to take into account the quality and distance of the land. The method was to allocate more distant land to those with more labor, and more close land to those with insufficient labor; those with all distant land were given some close land, and those with all close land were exchanged for some distant land. As a result, yields are now generally similar, and the quality is no longer as disparate as before. (East)

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] In the in-depth anti-despotism movement in the Fourth District of Wuxun, the phenomenon of village cadres enriching themselves was found to be quite widespread. The leadership decided to re-examine the distribution of the fruits of victory. In 52 villages throughout the district, most villages had not distributed the fruits of victory, or the distribution was unfair. For example, in Ni Village, village cadres casually bought the fruits of the struggle at low prices. In addition to a lot of pocket money, the self-defense captain also wanted a good coffin, which he sold to someone else in exchange for a house. The masses reflected that, "I won't struggle anymore! We spend all night without anything to eat. We follow the struggle all the time, but we don't get anything big or small. What's the point?" This created contradictions between village cadres, and between village cadres and the masses. The masses became disheartened and the organization fell apart. Based on the situation in the village, the leadership was determined to distribute the fruits of victory reasonably. First, the cadres were educated to clear their minds, and the fruits of victory were redistributed according to the principle of "whatever we have, we share." Land was leveled up from the bottom, and floating wealth was all priced and divided equally. As a result, every family received a share of the fruits of victory, and everyone was happy.

    自动让田实现填补
    武训四区教育村干重新分配果实
    【本报讯】武安老区赵庄村经过一个月来的细密分配果实，现已实现填平补齐。兹将其分配过程报导如次：该村在去冬割尾巴运动之后，村干部一般都不重视分田，觉得经过几年来减租查减，谁家也有了地种，只把最后斗出的几顷地随便分分就行了，只有其他财物的分配是重要的。但在杂物分配之后，一检查，却发现土地问题还很多。地有远有近，有肥有瘦，远的五、六里，一天送粪只能送两次，近的一天能送二、三十次。肥的一亩打三石（小石）、瘦的一亩打二、三斗。有些户土地又近又好，有些户的地又远又坏。干部认为这是没办法的事，打算马马虎虎照每人三、四亩填平就算。有的户每人有产三石的二亩好近地，还给再填一亩同等地，以便合够三亩；而另外有些户每人八亩地、只打两小石多，也认为这就行啦。分时先尽一百七十户军烈属分好的，结果，只填了一百六十户就没一点近地了。其中有的军属原来地都很好，每人达到十几石产量，还把很少的几亩坏地也都换成好地。一般贫农都不满意，与军属形成对立。以后领导上与评议会共同讨论，一致议决改变这种分田办法，将全村土地产量总计一下，每人能合五石多。实行按产量计算，军属每人不超过六石左右，一般得地户不低于五石左右。同时号召以前在减租查减中获地（或收回、或贱买回）多而又好的村干部积极分子自动让出一部来帮助穷弟兄翻身。合作社经理李补贵与民兵队长首先响应，让出好地十多亩。军属薛长林家也自动让出六亩多。接着有几家得地多的积极分子新翻身户纷纷自愿让田，共让出一顷多中等好地。后经群众议定，一方面按产量分，一方面照顾好坏远近地适当调剂。方法是劳力多的多分点远地，劳力不足的多分点近地，全是远地的填点近地，全是近地的换给点远地。这样，又经过十多天细密分配，现在产量一般都差不多，质量也不像以前那么悬殊了。（东）
    【本报讯】武训四区在深入查减运动中，发现村干中饱现象相当普遍，领导上决定重新检查果实分配。全区五十二村，大部分村庄没分果实，或分的不公。如倪屯村村干随便以低价买斗争果实，自卫队长除了好多零用东西外，又要了一口好棺材，转卖给别人换了一处宅子，群众纷纷的反映说：“再也不斗啦！有熬的夜，没吃的食，经常跟着斗，大小东西得不到一点，还干个啥劲”。形成了村干与村干、村干与群众相互之间的矛盾，群众消沉，组织涣散。领导上根据该村情况，决心把果实合理的分配。首先教育干部，打通思想，按没啥分啥的原则重新分果实。地一律从下往上补齐，浮财都作成价划等分配，这样一来家家都分了果实，人人都高兴。
