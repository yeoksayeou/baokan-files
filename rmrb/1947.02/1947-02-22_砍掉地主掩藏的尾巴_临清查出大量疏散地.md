　　Cutting off the Landlords' Hidden Tails
　　Linqing Uncovers Large Amounts of Dispersed Land
　　[Our Newspaper] In the four and a half districts west of the Wei River in Linqing, the problems left over from the mass movement over the years were resolved in this investigation and rent reduction, and the landlords' dispersed land was thoroughly cleaned up. In Malan Village, the landlord falsely sold as much as 219 mu, and in Taipingzhuang, the landlord Sun Yukun falsely mortgaged as much as 89 mu. In Xiaoluzhuang, the amount of land concealed in darkness reached more than two qing, and there were even more serious situations in Xiabaosi, Tongcun, and other places. In order to maintain their feudal rule, the landlords used the method of dispersing land to hide their feudal tails. In this investigation and rent reduction, the leadership mobilized the masses to investigate, and the landlords' conspiracies were exposed house by house by the masses. There are many types of land dispersed by landlords. Generally, they are: 1. Nominee Land: That is, without any formalities, the land is registered under the names of relatives and friends, and only a name is added to the burden register. 2. Fake Mortgage and Fake Sale Land: That is, in order to escape liquidation, the landlord buys over the masses, and the buying and selling households agree to find an agent to handle the formal establishment of a contract. Fake mortgages and fake sales are the most common, with prices being less than one-tenth of the market price, and the buyers are mostly relatives and friends. 3. Black Concealed Land: Some landlords and rich peasants collude with village cadres, and some families of resistance members and village cadres conceal land. There are also many problems of this kind. 4. Fake Division of Family Property: Landlords and rich peasants divide the property ostensibly but not actually. In form, the land has been dispersed and become middle peasants, but in reality, the wealth is very large. 5. Suspended Land: In reality, this is a type of black concealed land. That is, the landlord and rich peasant give the land to their daughters, but in reality, neither village bears the burden, and some landlords and rich peasants withdraw from the burden register and transfer it to others. 6. Entrusted Land: This type of land is very far from the two villages, and the land buyers are mostly landlords and rich peasants. The general principle for resolution is to distribute the land dispersed by the landlord to farmers with little or no land. Nominee land mostly belongs to running dog elements and is taken over by the farmers' association. If it is a poor person who is a nominee for the landlord, more consideration is given. Fake mortgages and fake sales are taken over by the farmers' association for unified distribution, and black concealed land is severely punished, depending on the wealth of the landlords and rich peasants. Fake divisions of family property must be studied in terms of wealth. If they are still feudal landlords, they must be liquidated. The solution for suspended land is to take care of the poor, or confiscate it and give it to the farmers' association in the poor village. Entrusted land should also take care of the poor village.

　　砍掉地主掩藏的尾巴
    临清查出大量疏散地
    【本报讯】临清卫河西的四个半区，在这次查减中解决了数年来群运所遗留的问题，彻底清理了地主的疏散土地。马兰村地主假当卖达二百一十九亩之多，太平庄地主孙玉坤就假当八十九亩之多，小芦庄黑瞒地达两顷之多，夏堡寺、同村等都有更严重的情形。地主为了保持其封建的统治，用疏散土地的办法，掩藏封建尾巴，在这次查减中领导上发动群众清查，地主阴谋都被群众逐户的揭破。地主疏散土地是多种样式的，一般的是：一、顶名地：就是不经任何形式，把地作为亲戚朋友的，仅在负担册上添个名。二、假当假卖地：即是地主为了逃避清算，收买群众，买卖户约好，找经纪办理假形式的立文契。假当假卖最为普遍，价钱低于市价十倍以上，买者多为亲友。三、黑瞒地：有的地主富农和村干拉拢，有的抗属和村干瞒地，这类问题同样不少。四、假分家：地主富农明分暗不分。形式上土地已分散变成中农，实际上财富很大。五、悬空地：实际上则是黑瞒地的一种。即是地主富农把地说给闺女，实际上两村都不负担，有的地主富农从负担册退下，移到别人身上。六、寄庄地：这种地两村距离很远，买地户多系地主富农。解决的一般原则是把地主疏散的土地分给无地少地的农民。顶名地多系走里分子，收归农会所有，如系贫民给地主顶名即多照顾。假当假卖收归农会统一分配，黑瞒地从重处罚，根据地主和富农的财富处理。假分家必须研究富力，如仍系封建地主必须清理。悬空地的解决，照顾贫民，或没收归于贫村农会。寄庄地同样的要照顾贫村。
