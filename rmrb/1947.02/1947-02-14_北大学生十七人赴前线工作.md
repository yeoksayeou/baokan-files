    Seventeen male and female students from Northern University, after Principal Fan Wenlan proposed responding to cultural work to comfort the troops and support the patriotic self-defense war, have been requesting to participate in front-line work. Lü Ying and 16 others from the College of Arts and Education were selected as the first group. On the 4th, all teachers and students of the school held a farewell meeting. The seventeen students proposed to compete with each other in revolutionary work and play a model role. On the 5th, the heads of the school and colleges personally led all the staff to line up to see them off. Before parting, Principal Fan gave the students seventeen words: "Observe discipline, obey orders, and serve the people wholeheartedly." (Shao Ziqiang)

    北大学生十七人赴前线工作
    北方大学男女学生，自校长范文澜同志提出响应文化劳军，支援爱国自卫战争以后，就纷纷要求参加前线工作，文教学院吕英等十七人当选为第一批。四日全校师生开欢送大会，十七位同学互相提出在革命工作中竞赛，要起模范作用。五日，校院各首长亲率全体人员列队欢送。临别时，范校长赠给同学十七个字：“遵守纪律，服从命令，全心全意为人民服务”。（邵自强）
