    Taihang News Briefs
    Xiangyuan Local Grain Taxes
    Completely Self-Sufficient in Production
    Xiangyuan County's local grain taxes can now be completely self-sufficient in production this year. This will reduce the entire burden on the county's people by 11 percent. After the Taihang Administrative Office held a financial meeting last year, the county extracted a portion of the local grain taxes, under the principle of not affecting expenditures, to invest in the county's Wuyang Coal Mine and Woolen Mill. Currently, the coal mine's annual profit reaches 3,000 stones of fine grain, and the woolen mill can also generate profits of over 2 million yuan.
    Postal Construction Perfected, Sending to All Liberated Areas
    Taihang's postal construction is becoming increasingly perfect. Starting this year, in addition to the Northeast, registered mail can be sent to Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, Jin-Cha-Ji, Su-Wan, and Shandong. Furthermore, due to the Kuomintang army's offensive and the tense war situation in Qinyang and Bo'ai counties in northern Henan after October of last year, post offices suspended parcel and remittance services. Now, due to the development of our guerrilla warfare in the area and the stabilization of the situation, parcel and remittance services have resumed this year.
    Dajing, Fourth District of Huguan, Establishes Public Culture Center
    Sun Shoushan, the joint principal of Dajing in the Fourth District of Huguan, and Li Tibao, the model team leader, led the masses to establish a Public Culture Center. The center has a reading group of 12 people, a broadcasting group of 3 people, and a public blackboard group divided into four sections for writing, submitting, interviewing, and reviewing. Combining radio station broadcasts to promote current events and production news, there are cultural instructors responsible for teaching the masses literacy classes, with a fixed meeting system every five and ten days. The masses are extremely satisfied and say, "Public culture is run by everyone, this is great!" (Zhao Sixin)
    Adapting to Production Needs, Donggou Organizes Night School
    Due to some parents' requests for students to study at night and spare some time for production during the day, schools in the Donggou school district of Wuxiang have successively organized night boarding students to strengthen nighttime learning. Currently, the entire school district has reached 132 night boarding students. After the opening of night boarding classes, nighttime learning is extremely intense. Parents say, "Students learning one night's worth of material can match a day's worth." "Winter learning can compensate for delays during the busy farming season." This movement is currently being continued, and all teachers in the district are very enthusiastic. (Li Rong)

    适应生产要求  东沟组织夜校
    武乡东沟学区各校，因有些家长要求学生夜晚学习，白天能搞出些时间生产，便纷纷组织夜宿生，加强夜间学习。现全学区夜宿生已达一百卅二名。开办夜宿班后，夜间学习极为紧张，家长们说：“学生学一夜的东西，能顶一天。”“冬天学习可补偿农忙时的耽误。”现正继续开展这一运动，全区教员都很起劲。（李荣）
