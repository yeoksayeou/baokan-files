    Two Documents

    This newspaper published Comrade Bo Yibo's call for production and thrift to welcome the light on the 7th of this month; on the 10th, it published the notice from the Central Bureau Administrative Office and the General Branch Committee regarding the launch of a personal production campaign for the organs. Comrade Bo Yibo's call is the action guideline for all military and civilians in the rear of our region to dedicate all their strength to support the front in achieving the great task of defeating the invading Chiang troops. The notice from the Central Bureau Administrative Office and the General Branch Committee is the concrete method for completing this task. These are two extremely important documents at present. Seriously implement and realize these two documents, and we will transform ourselves, transform the lives of our organs, improve our work and study, and allow each of us, each organ, to record our names on the merit book in the movement to perform meritorious service for the people.

    Currently, the production and thrift movement in various organs is underway. We hope that everyone can earnestly study these two documents, deeply understand the spirit of the documents, create more methods, and launch a mass production and study upsurge.

    两个文件
    本报于本月七日发表了薄一波同志生产节约迎接光明的号召；十日发表了中央局行政处及总支委会关于开展机关个人生产运动的通知。一波同志的号召，是我们全区后方军民，在实现打败进犯蒋军的伟大任务中，拿出一切力量支援前线的行动指针。中央局行政处及总支委会的通知，则是完成这一任务的具体办法。这是当前两个极重要的文件。认真贯彻与实现这两个文件，就会改造我们个人，改造我们机关的生活，改进我们的工作与学习，就会让我们每一个人，每一个机关，在为人民立功运动中，在功劳簿上记下自己的名字。
    现在，各机关的生产节约运动正在开展。我们希望大家都能认真学习这两个文件，深切体会文件的精神，创造更多的办法，掀起一个群众性的生产与学习的热潮。
