　　Mutually Connecting to Mobilize the Backward to Expose Many Hidden Landlords
    The Second District of Xiangyuan Deepens Movement Experience
    [This newspaper’s Taihang dispatch on the 26th] After half a month of effort, the Second District of Xiangyuan has fully mobilized the six hundred-odd "backward" peasants discovered in the door-to-door inspection last month. The awakening of this backward stratum has resolved many hidden landlords, deepening the movement in the district. For example, after farmers like Li Yousheng in Beilixin Village broke the "fate" viewpoint, they immediately complained and connected with each other. After the hired laborer Ma Shanqing in Dongshandicun became aware, he united the masses and overthrew the feudal group in the village. The "backward" masses in Quxiang Village rose up and overthrew the landlord Li Yuzhen, who had been shielded by past cadres, and were able to automatically urge the cadres and monitor special agents during the movement. The "backward" masses in Dongboyang Village also cleared up four "capable" landlords recognized by the cadres and recovered a lot of fruits. The methods and experiences of mobilizing the backward in the district are: 1. Investigate, research, and patiently educate: District cadres, based on detailed investigations, categorized and researched their actual thoughts. The district discovered more than ten types of people, including those who spoke of "conscience," "fate," "favor," feared change, feared having their crops cut, thought the elderly couldn't get ahead, petty pseudo-cadres, those suspected of being running dogs, those who were bumped into for speaking out due to poor cadre work style, those who were dissatisfied with the fruit distribution, those who had no problems and thought they wouldn't get any fruit, and those who were often not in the village such as sheep workers and hired laborers. After researching various thoughts, on the one hand, the Joint Defense held general meetings of the "backward" masses, using the method of touching hearts to guide them to complain, and using practical examples to inspire their awakening; on the other hand, typical examples were selected in each type for education to connect them. 2. Mobilize the masses to connect with each other: For example, in Nanlixin Village, the thoughts of backward members were first opened up in the farmers' association, and the members were used as the backbone to form the entire village into eighteen groups, competing with each other to divide labor and make surprise attacks, and each member was allowed to choose a mobilization object to "see through the disease and prescribe the right medicine," and persuade them. In this way, seventy-two silent people in the village were mobilized in five days. 3. Cadres and "backward" masses hold joint meetings, on the one hand, cadres review themselves, and on the other hand, they support them. 4. After the backward stratum is involved in the movement, attention should be paid to studying their thoughts and emotions, and education should be carried out at any time with practical facts. It is not necessary to wait for them to be fully aware before entering into action, but should gradually educate and mobilize in action. 5. After the "backward" masses become active, a joint meeting of new and old activists should be convened to unify understanding and resolve relationship issues. The old activists should change their arrogant style of looking down on latecomers, and the new activists should respect the former. In this way, the few who have not yet moved will also be affected and quickly rise up.

　　互相串连发动落后追出不少隐蔽地主
    襄垣二区深入运动经验
    【本报太行二十六日电】襄垣二区经半月努力已将全区上月挨门挨户检查中发现的六百余“落后”农民完全发动起来。这一落后层的觉悟解决了不少隐伏的地主，使该区运动深入一步。如北里信村农民李有圣等打破“命运”观点后，立即诉苦串通。东山底村雇工马善庆觉悟后，团结群众斗倒了该村的封建集团。曲襄村的“落后”群众起来斗倒了过去干部包庇着的地主李玉贞，并能在运动中自动督促干部与监视特务。东伯阳村“落后”群众又清算了四家干部认为的“干”地主、收回不少果实。该区发动落后的作法与经验是：一、调查研究耐心教育：区干部根据细致调查，就其思想实际分类加以研究。该区共发现讲“良心”、“命运”、“情面”、怕变天、怕割韭菜、认为老年吃不开、小伪干部、有狗腿嫌疑及因干部作风不好发言被碰过的、不满意果实分配、无问题自认为分不上果实与常不在村的羊工雇工等十余种，将各种思想加以研究后，一面以联防普遍召开“落后”群众会议，用摸心事办法引导其诉苦，用实际例子启发其觉悟；一面在每一类型中选择典型加以教育使其串通。二、发动群众互相串通：如南里信村首先在农会中打通落后会员思想，以会员为骨干将全村组成十八个小组，互相竞赛分工突击，并让每一会员自选一发动对象，“看透病、下对药”；加以说服。这样五天即将全村七十二个不吭气的人发动起来。三、干部与“落后”群众开联席会，一面干部检讨自己，一面对其撑腰作主。四、落后层卷入运动后应注意研究其思想情绪，随时以实际事实加以教育。并不必等待其完全觉悟后始进入行动，而应在行动中逐渐教育、发动。五、“落后”群众积极起来后，应召开新旧积极分子联席会统一认识，解决关系问题。使旧积极分子转变看不起后进者的自高自大作风，使新积极分子尊重前者。这样，少数还未动起来的也会受到影响很快起来。
