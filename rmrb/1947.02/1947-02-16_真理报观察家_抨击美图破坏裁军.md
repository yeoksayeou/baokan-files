　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 14th: TASS reports: A diplomatic observer for Pravda recently authored an article stating: World democratic public opinion and millions of people do not understand why the Security Council has not fulfilled the task previously assigned to it by Chiang and both parties, namely to immediately begin practical measures for universal disarmament. Genuine disarmament clearly frightens certain elements in the United States, who are prepared to oppose it. During the Security Council's discussion of a simple procedural issue, the US representative in fact came out against the UN General Assembly's resolution on disarmament from last year. According to the US representative's opinion, before the US takes responsibility based on a disarmament plan, "effective safeguards" that "guarantee security" should be created. "Effective safeguards" means the US's 'take-it-or-leave-it' approach of forcing others to accept the US's "control of atomic energy plan." When the US representative agreed to establish a disarmament committee, they attached a condition to this "concession," namely that the committee should not deal with the issue of atomic bombs, so that the most dangerous weapons of destruction should be "exempt from restrictions" and "reductions"! This is not conducive to guaranteeing universal peace and security.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 14th: According to various reports: The Security Council re-discussed the procedural issue of implementing a disarmament plan on the 12th, but no agreement was reached. The focus of the dispute lies in the relationship between the authority of the proposed disarmament committee and the atomic energy committee. US representative Austin insisted that the disarmament committee should only deal with all "ordinary" weapons, while all "weapons of mass destruction should be handled by the atomic energy committee." Soviet representative Gromyko believed that the responsibilities of the two committees should not be separated and accused the United States of hindering attention to the basic task of disarmament by creating opposition between the two committees, instead concentrating attention on organizational issues. Australian representative Hasluck proposed a compromise, namely that the relationship between the authority of the two committees should not be strictly defined. The Security Council did not make any decisions on all of the above opinions.

### 真理报观察家  抨击美图破坏裁军

    抨击美图破坏裁军
    【新华社延安十四日电】塔斯社讯：真理报外交观察家顷著文称：全世界民主舆论与千百万人们，不了解安理会何以未实践蒋及两方以前交与它的任务，即对普遍裁军，立刻开始实际的措施。真正的裁军，显然是吓住了美国某些方面的人士，他们已准备反对此举，在安理会讨论单纯的程序问题时，美代表事实上是出面反对联大去年关于裁军的决议。按照美代表的意见，在美国根据裁军计划，担负责任之前，“应该造成保证安全的”“有效的保障”。“有效保障”即美国的哀的美敦书方式，强令别人接受美国“管制原子能计划”之谓。美代表在同意成立裁军委员会时，对于这一“让步”提出条件，即该委员会不应处理原子弹问题，这样一来最危险的毁灭武器就应该“免除限制”与“缩减”了！这是不适应保证普遍和平与安全之利益的。
    【新华社延安十四日电】据各方报导：安理会于十二日重新讨论实施裁军方案的程序问题，仍未获协议。争执焦点，在于拟议中的裁军委员会与原子能委员会的权限关系。美代表奥斯丁坚持裁军委员会只处理一切“普通”的武器，而一切“大规模毁灭的武器，则交原子能委员会处理之”。苏代表葛罗米柯认为，两个委员会的职责不应分开，并指责美国在两个委员会之间所造成的对立，阻碍了对裁军基本任务的注意，而把注意力集中在组织问题上。澳代表哈斯洛克提出折衷意见，即两个委员会之间的权限关系，不作严格规定，安理会对所有上述意见，俱未作出决定。
