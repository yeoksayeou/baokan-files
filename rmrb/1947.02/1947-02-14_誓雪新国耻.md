    Vow to Wipe Out the New National Humiliation
    November 4th is the day that the national degenerate Chiang Kai-shek signed the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty". Since the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government decided that this day should be a National Humiliation Memorial Day, it has been unanimously accepted and responded to by the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas. This newspaper reports that the third meeting of the Border Region Government Committee has decided that this day will be a National Humiliation Memorial Day, and every year on this day, all sectors of the Border Region will lower the flag to half-mast to express grief until the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" is abolished. This move is a manifestation of the will of the 30 million people in the region, and it is to safeguard national dignity and national interests. We resolutely support this wise decision of the government.
    In order to implement this decision of the government and wash away the national humiliation, we call on all sectors of the military, government, and people in the region to widely publicize the government's decision and the letter to compatriots throughout the country. Expose Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of expanding the civil war and selling out national territory and sovereignty; expose the aggressive policies of the American imperialists, their support for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, and all kinds of crimes of enslaving the Chinese people. Make these crimes known to every household in the entire region, understood by women and children, arouse righteous indignation, and turn it into action.
    The will of the great people is inviolable, and the national humiliation must and will be redressed. Japanese imperialism and Wang Jingwei are examples that everyone remembers vividly. The decision of the Border Region Government will further promote the people of the entire region to resolutely fight to complete this sacred task.

    誓雪新国耻
    十一月四日，是民族败类蒋介石签字“蒋美商约”的日子。自陕甘宁边区政府决定是日为国耻纪念日后，先后得到各解放区广大军民一致接受响应。本日报载，边府委员会第三次大会已决定是日为国耻纪念日，每年这天全边区各界下半旗志哀，直至“蒋美商约”废除为止。这一举措，是全区三千万人民意志的表现，是维护民族尊严与国家权益，我们坚决拥护政府这一贤明决定。
    为贯彻政府这一决定，洗雪国耻，我们号召全区军政民各界，根据边府决定及告全国同胞书，广为宣传。揭发蒋介石扩大内战出卖国家领土主权的罪恶；揭发美帝国主义者侵略政策，及其支持蒋介石内战，和奴役中国人民的种种罪行。使这些罪行在全区人民中家喻户晓。妇孺皆知，激起义愤，变成行动。
    伟大人民的意志是不可侮的，国耻必须昭雪，也必定能昭雪，日本帝国主义与汪精卫，便是大家记忆犹新的例子。边府的决定将更加推动全区人民为完成这个神圣的任而坚决奋斗。
