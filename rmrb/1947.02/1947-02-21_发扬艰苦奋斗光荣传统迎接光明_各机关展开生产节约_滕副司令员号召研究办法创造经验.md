　　【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】 The production and thrift campaign is currently being widely carried out in various agencies directly under the Border Region, as well as various military region party, government, military, and civilian units. Deputy Commander Teng of the Military Region specifically commended this active response to the Central Bureau's call to vigorously implement production and thrift at the joint meeting of various agencies directly under the Central Bureau's General Office. He said, "Under the Central Bureau's call for production and thrift, all agencies have been organized. The cadres of the Central Bureau agencies have been spinning cotton and letting the public work, etc., for production; the Border Region government achieved great results in production last year and is continuing to work hard this year; other units such as the Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, Supply Department, People's Daily, and Xinhua Bookstore are all doing very well in production and thrift, and many agencies are now formulating production and thrift plans, which are all very good phenomena. The Party member comrades of the Supply Department disclosed their property to the Party and handed over more than one million yuan to the Party, which is also worthy of commendation." Then, Deputy Commander Teng praised the actions of the Taihang Administrative Office in reducing the standard of living, the Taiyue agencies in becoming completely self-sufficient except for clothing and food and handing over 2,000 yuan to the public, and the units in southern Hebei and Hebei-Shandong-Henan in working hard on production and thrift; he then called on all units to continue to study methods, introduce experiences, and commend models, and to develop this year's production and thrift campaign into a universal, large-scale, and mass-based movement. Finally, Deputy Commander Teng specifically put forward two points that must be paid attention to in order to do a good job in the production and thrift campaign in the future: (1) It is necessary to put down airs. He said: Because of the "peace talks," many people's appetites have increased, so it is difficult to put down airs, but they must be put down quickly. Deputy Commander Teng gave an example: He once visited a seventeen or eighteen-year-old young messenger in the Military Region Dispatch Office, who could spin four ounces of cotton per day, but because his appetite for smoking was too great (he smoked a pack of cigarettes every day), his production efforts could not keep up with his consumption. (2) Responsible comrades in administration and party branches, as well as general affairs management departments, must calculate accurately and scientifically organize life and manage life. Otherwise, even if the entire agency has worked hard on production and thrift, the life management department will still be wasteful or poorly organized, and then everyone's standard of living will still be unprotected to a certain extent. Deputy Commander Teng emphasized that if life management is well organized, then under today's supply conditions of thrift production and reduced living standards, life can still be good, such as at the Military and Political University, which is also under today's supply conditions, precisely because they manage well, so each person can guarantee to eat two catties of meat per month and six mace of oil and six mace of salt per day. Good living conditions can not only ensure the smooth progress of work, but more importantly, can also ensure that everyone gets sick less or not at all during the disease season, and is very healthy.

　　【News from This Newspaper】 After reading the notices from the Administrative Office and the General Branch Committee, the Central Bureau Reception Office began to reorganize the original production organization and determined that the agency's production should focus on transportation and secondarily on building houses. Individual production should focus on making shoes and secondarily on growing land and bean sprouts. The preparations for individual production have now been completed, and all staff members are participating in shoe production. They have all sawed the shoe sole splints with wood, which can increase the speed by one time. The villagers have also begun to imitate them. Six hammers have been made, technical instructors have been hired, and group leaders have been elected. Each person must complete more than three hours of tasks, and write down in writing how to ensure the completion of the tasks and hand them over to the group leader for safekeeping for inspection. In order to promote and organize praise and criticism more effectively, a wall newspaper has also been created. The first issue has now been published, and submissions from residents have been accepted. The comrades in the kitchen mainly use raising pigs for thrift as their individual production. In addition to this, they also planted more than one mu of land and are now accumulating fertilizer. But when the organization told them that the kitchen had no production tasks, they proposed to cultivate this production (planning to produce 300 catties of millet) for Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng.

　　发扬艰苦奋斗光荣传统迎接光明
    各机关展开生产节约
    滕副司令员号召研究办法创造经验
    【本报特讯】生产节约运动，目前正在边区直属各机关、各军区党政军民单位普遍展开。军区滕副司令员对此种积极响应中央局号召，厉行生产节约的行动，特在中央局办公厅各直属机关的联席会上提出表扬。他说：“在中央局生产节约的号召下，各机关都组织起来了。中央局机关干部进行了纺花，让公家做工等生产；边区政府去年生产就很有成绩，今年又在继续努力；其他如军区司令部、政治部、供给部、人民日报、新华书店，生产节约都搞得很好，许多机关现在都在订生产节约计划，这都是很好的现象。供给部党员同志们，把自己财产向党公开，并把一百多万块钱交给党，这也是值得表扬的。”接着，滕副司令员赞扬了太行行署降低生活水平，太岳各机关除衣食外全部自给并交公两千元，冀南、冀鲁豫等单位努力生产节约的行动后；即号召各单位，应当继续研究办法，介绍经验，表扬模范，把今年的生产节约运动开展成为一个普遍性的，大规模的群众性的运动。最后，滕副司令员特别提出了今后生产节约运动要搞好必须注意的两点：（一）必须放下架子。他说：因为闹“和平”，许多人的胃口都提高了，因此一下架子放不下来，但是，必须赶快放下来。滕副司令员举了一个例子：他曾经访问了军区收发处一位十七八岁的青年通讯员，他每天可以纺四两花，但是就是因为他抽烟的胃口太大（每天要抽一包纸烟），因此他的生产努力无论如何也供不上他的消耗了。（二）行政上和党的支部负责同志，总务管理部门，必须精确计算，科学的组织生活与管理生活。不然，尽管全机关努力进行了生产节约，生活管理部门却一样浪费或组织得不好，那么大家一定程度的生活水平仍然会是没有保障的。滕副司令员强调的提出：要是生活管理组织得好，那么在今天节约生产、降低生活水平的供给条件下，仍然可以把生活搞好，如像军政大学也是在今天的供给条件下，正因为他们管理得好，因此每人每月可以保证吃二斤肉，每天每人吃六钱油，六钱盐。生活搞好了不但可以保证工作很好的进行，更重要的，也可以使大家在生病季节到来的时候，保证大家少生病和不生病，身体很健康。
    【本报讯】中央局招待处，读了行政处与总支委会的通知以后，就开始整顿原有的生产组织，并确定机关生产以运输为主，以盖房为副。个人生产以做鞋为主，以种地生豆芽为副。现在个人生产的准备已经完成，所有工作人员都参加做鞋生产，自己都用木头锯好了纳鞋底的夹板，这样可以增加速度到一倍。老乡们也都开始仿造。锤子已打好了六个，聘请了技术指导人，选举了小组长，每人都要完成三小时以上的任务，并把自己如何保证任务完成的办法用书面写出来交给小组长保存以备用来检查。为了推动与组织表扬与批评的更加有力，又创刊了墙报，现在第一期已经出版，并吸收了住所人员投稿。伙房的同志主要以养猪节约为自己的个人生产，除此以外他们还种了一亩多地，现在正在积肥。但组织上告他们说伙房没有生产任务时，他们就提出来要把这生产下的东西（计划要生产三百斤小米）替刘司令员和邓政委作代耕。（琳）
