    The People's Army Performs Meritorious Service for the People
　　How Vicious and Shameless Chiang Kai-shek Is!
    People have already drowned, and the Yellow River water has already flowed past, yet he sends planes to scatter leaflets downstream in the old course, shedding crocodile tears, feigning compassion. This will only further increase the people's anger and determination to seek revenge!
    [Report from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 30th] At noon on the 24th, two American-style airplanes secretly flew over the old course of the Yellow River, scattering leaflets in the Fan County, Shou Zhang, and Zhang Qiu sections, with countless leaflets falling into the Yellow River. The leaflet's "Emergency Notice" stated: "The Yellow River's water is now flowing eastward, so please, compatriots residing within the old course, quickly relocate to avoid the danger of being flooded." Chiang Kai-shek had already released the water on the 28th of last month, and the head of the water had already flowed past the old course in our liberated areas. Residents along the river who were flooded and picked up this "Emergency Notice" unanimously condemned Chiang Kai-shek's viciousness and shamelessness. Gao Tanghui, a resident of Gao Zhuang Village in Shou Zhang County, received 21 mu of land after the land reform. After the Yellow River water flowed into the old course, he has already lost 10 mu. If the water level rises again, all of his fields will be submerged. The reeds he planted in the riverbed last year have also been completely submerged. He picked up this "Emergency Notice" and said fiercely: "Every wrong has its doer, every debt its debtor. Sooner or later, I'll let you know how powerful the common people are!" Lin Jinhai, a disaster victim from Fan County living in Li Zhuang Village in Shou Zhang County, picked up an "Emergency Notice" while returning home to salvage his belongings. He took it back to show his father, who said: "People have already drowned, and Chiang Kai-shek is still shedding crocodile tears. Son, don't panic; this revenge will be taken sooner or later!"

    人民的军队为人民立功
　　好狠毒无耻的蒋介石！
    人都早已淹死了，黄水早已流过去了，他又派飞机在故道下游撒传单，猫哭耗子假慈悲，这只有更增加人民的愤怒与复仇决心！
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】二十四日中午，美式飞机两架，潜黄河故道在范县、寿张、张秋等段散发传单，无数传单散落在黄水中。传单“紧急通告”说：“黄河的水，现已向东流，居住在故道里面的同胞们，请赶快迁移以免受到水淹的危险。”蒋介石在上月二十八日就已放水，水头早已流过我解放区故道。沿河被淹居民拾得这张“紧急通告”，一致通告蒋介石狠毒与无耻。寿张县高庄居民高棠辉，翻身后分得土地二十一亩，黄水流入故道后，已损失了十亩，若水势再涨，所有田地将全被淹没。去年他栽在河床中的芦苇，也全被淹没了。他拾得这张“紧急通告”，狠狠的说：“冤有头，债有主，早晚叫你晓得老百姓的厉害！”住在寿张县李庄的范县灾民林金海，回家打捞财物时，拾到一张“紧急通告”，他带回给父亲看，他父亲说：“人都淹死了，蒋介石还来个猫哭耗子，孩子别慌，这个仇总是要报的！”
