　　The Rapidly Victorious Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Region
    Zhan Chao
    Since last winter, good news has been constantly coming from the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area. What exactly is this place?
    Let's open the map and take Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Bengbu, and Xinyang as base points to delineate the area west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, south of the Longhai Railway, and north of the Huai River. This is the general outline of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area. Its central area is in the area east of the New Yellow River, including Qi (County), Tai (Kang), and Yong (Cheng). In the language of the Anti-Japanese War period, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu was a "grid," situated between three railways and crisscrossed by many highways and the New Yellow River. This "grid" is now beginning to be broken, and its central area is connected to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area north of the Longhai Railway.
    The creation of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area, like other liberated areas, went through a difficult and tortuous process. Except for some relatively barren parts along the coast of Bohai, Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu is a rich area, especially the Ying River (later the New Yellow River) and the Huai River basin, which in the past were known as "Golden Qi County, Silver Tai Kang." However, due to the warlord infighting of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Chiang Kai-shek government, this area became impoverished. In particular, Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Yellow River dikes at Zhaokou and Huayuankou in Central Plains in June 1938 caused the Yellow River's waters to flood and engulf 320,000 people, destroying 6.5 million mu of fertile land, making the people here even more miserable. Even so, the traitors and bandits of the Chiang Kai-shek government still did not relax their extortion of the people in the flooded areas, insisting on squeezing oil from bran! An old scholar named Chen Lun in Xiliu Village, Huaiyang County, committed suicide because he could not bear the extortion of the Chiang Kai-shek government, leaving behind a poem of despair before his death:
    "My Huaiyang,
    Truly pitiable!
    The people have no skin left intact!
    Tigers eat meat!
    Wolves gnaw bones!
    Rice, wheat, and money are all taken!
    The house is empty,
    Nothing to burn,
    Fathers and sons, brothers do not look after each other!
    ………
    There is no door to the earth,
    There is no road to heaven,
    Only death leaves the family to weep!"
    A wealthy family in a wealthy county suffered such a fate, so one can imagine what happened to others! The people there even cried out: "We would rather be burned and killed by the devils than have the 13th Army (Tang Enbo's troops) stationed here!" This shows that Chiang's army was even worse than the Japanese invaders. Therefore, when the Japanese invaders attacked Central Plains in 1944, Chiang Kai-shek's 13th and 96th armies fled in panic, so embarrassed that even the horses' hooves were wrapped in cotton covers. At this time, the people there automatically rose up, seized their guns and cannons, and fought against the Japanese invaders.
    In order to support the guerrilla warfare of the masses in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border region, southern Henan, and western Henan, and to recover the vast territory abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, at the request of the people, advanced into the Japanese-occupied areas of Central Plains in three routes: the first route departed from Hubei and Anhui and went north along the Beijing-Hankou Railway; the second route crossed the Yellow River from the Taihang and Taiyue Mountains and entered western Henan; the third route departed from northern Jiangsu and Shandong and Henan, advancing into eastern Henan, which is the central area of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu. At that time, eight anti-Japanese democratic county governments were quickly established behind enemy lines. Comrade Peng Yunfeng, commander of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army and commander of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, gloriously sacrificed his life in this battle to liberate the people of the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border! In order to commemorate this national hero, the people there changed Yongcheng County, where Commander Peng died, to Xuefeng County.
    After half a year of construction, the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area was consolidated. By January 1945, Peng Xuefeng's troops alone had fought 183 battles with the Japanese and puppet troops, removing 39 enemy strongholds, killing and wounding 98 Japanese company commanders and county advisors and below, capturing two alive, killing and wounding 592 puppet brigade commanders and county magistrates and below, capturing 1,150 alive, and 47 defecting. In April and May, they attacked Renji, an important town in northern Jiangsu, capturing Ren Yahang, commander of the puppet 15th Division, and more than 500 others; crossed the New Yellow River and swept away enemy and puppet strongholds, successively capturing important towns and villages such as Chaizhuang between Yanling and Weishi, Nancao, Huanglongdian, and Zhuanqiao Town and Wangting Temple between Shangshui and Shangcai; in early August, the Dasheng (newly established county) Brigade marched sixty miles and advanced to Xinghuaying on the Longhai Railway, fifteen miles west of Kaifeng, and the Helou area between Kaifeng and Zhuxian Town, severely annihilating the Japanese garrison troops and the puppet Baojia self-defense团 in the area.
    When Japan surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek let the Japanese and puppet troops "maintain order" for him, which deeply angered the people of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu. They raised their fists and shouted: "Let's do it!" Thus, thousands of militiamen and thousands of stretchers followed their sons and brothers, the New Fourth Army and the Eighth Route Army, to the front lines. As a result, Kaifeng, Xuefeng, Taikang, Qixian and other county towns and vast territories were liberated, and the traitors and executioners Du Chuntai and others were either captured or killed.
    Just as the people of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu were about to breathe a sigh of relief and build their own peaceful and happy lives under the leadership of the Communist Party's democratic government, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war cannons pointed at the people of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu again. Last year—from May to June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek used the 81st Division, 181st Division, and other forces of more than 20,000 men to repeatedly "suppress" the heartland of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, forcibly occupying 312 towns such as Qixian, Taikang, Fugou, and Chenliu. Immediately afterward, a second "suppression" came in late June. Chiang Kai-shek attempted to destroy the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberated Area in one fell swoop, and specially equipped the 81st Division with ten American-made tanks, forty military vehicles, and many other heavy weapons.
    But the victor was not Chiang Kai-shek, but the soldiers and civilians of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu. Last August, just as Chiang's army was advancing north, the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu people's armed forces and the large army led by General Liu Bocheng echoed each other, launching a surprise attack on the Kaifeng Airport, one of the nerve centers of Chiang's army, and liberating Zhuxian Town, one of the four major towns south of Kaifeng. The battle to recover Qixian even annihilated the elite of Chiang's 81st Division. Even more, from the 5th of this month, they recovered seven county towns including Qixian, Taikang, Luyi, Zhecheng, Bozhou, Ningling, and Suixian in five days. This further proves that this vast area will ultimately belong to the people. These county towns have recently been voluntarily evacuated due to strategic considerations, but Chiang's army's entry into the abandoned empty cities only increases the chance of being annihilated.
    The year before last—on November 14, 1945, the New York Afternoon newspaper published a letter from an American soldier, which mentioned his observations in the Yellow River flood area of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu: "On every side you can see, there is water, and there are only some small islands in the water, with trees and houses on them. Their entire fields are submerged in water, and I don't know how they live! I think chickens, ducks, pigs, and household industries are probably all submerged in water!" In fact, during the most difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu army and civilians had only five villages as anti-Japanese democratic base areas, and these villages were all in the watery area mentioned by the American soldier. Communist Party members, Eighth Route Army soldiers, New Fourth Army soldiers, and democratic government workers, loyal to the cause of national liberation, not only persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle in such difficult environments and solved difficulties with their own hands, but also helped the masses to plant and cultivate the land. In 1944, when the New Fourth Army's Commander Peng's army marched west to save the people of Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, they not only fought battles, but also planted more than 100 mu of sorghum fields, and later turned all 4,206 mu of mountains, rivers, and reeds in the deserted flooded area into fertile land. The masses who had fled from famine returned one after another, helping the old and the young, and rebuilt their homes with the help of the democratic government.
    Now, on this land irrigated with the blood of General Peng Xuefeng and spreading the names of heroes such as Wang Kangtai and Li Liansheng who crossed the river to kill the enemy, the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu army and civilians are cooperating with the armies and civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas in combat. In this war of self-defense, it can pierce the spine of Chiang's army at any time.

　　捷音频传的豫皖苏
    展潮
    去冬以来，捷音不断从豫皖苏解放区传来，倒底那是什么样一个地方？
    且让我们把地图打开，以徐州、郑州、蚌埠和信阳为基点，把津浦路西、平汉路东、陇海路南、淮河以北这块地方划下来。这就是豫皖苏解放区大的轮廓。它的中心区在新黄河以东的杞（县）太（康）永（城）一带。用抗日战争时期的话来说，豫皖苏是“格子网”，它处在三条铁路之间，其中还有许多公路线和新黄河割裂着。这个“格子网”现在开始被打破了，它的中心区和陇海路北冀鲁豫解放区已联成了一片。
    豫皖苏解放区的创建，也和其他解放区一样，是经过艰难曲折的过程的。豫皖苏除渤海沿岸某些部分比较贫瘠外，向富足之区，尤其是颖水（后来的新黄河）和淮河流域，过去有“金杞县、银太康”之称。但是由于蒋军阀混战，蒋政府的横征暴敛这一带是穷了。尤其是蒋介石一九三八年六月在中原赵口和花园口两处决开黄河堤，一泻千里的黄水，吞没了三十二万人口，冲毁了六百五十万亩良田，把这里的人整得更惨了。就是这样，蒋政府的汉奸土匪们，仍不放松对泛区人民的勒索，硬要从糠秕里榨出油来！淮阳县西柳村一个老秀才叫陈伦，因为受不了蒋政府的讹榨而自杀，临死时留下一首绝命诗：
    “我淮阳，
    真可哭！
    民间未有完肌肤！
    虎吃肉！
    狼肯骨！
    米、麦、钱物一齐出！
    屋已空，
    吃烧无，
    父子兄弟不相顾！
    ………
    入地地无门，
    上天天无路，
    只有一死留下家人哭！”
    一个富裕县份里的一个富裕家庭，竟是如此遭遇，其他人可想而知！那里老百姓甚至发出这样的呼声：“宁叫鬼子烧杀，不愿叫十三军（汤恩伯部）来驻扎！”足见蒋军比日本侵略者还要坏。因此，当一九四四年日寇进攻中原，蒋介石的十三军九十六军等仓惶撤走，狼狈得连马蹄都是用棉套包裹着。这时候那里的老百姓便自动起来把他的枪炮夺过来，和日本侵略者战斗。
    为了支援豫皖苏边和豫南、豫西群众的游击战争，收复被蒋介石遗弃的广大国土，八路军和新四军应人民之请，分三路先后向中原沦陷区挺进：第一路从鄂皖出发，沿平汉路北上；第二路从太行太岳横渡黄河，进入豫西；第三路从淮北、冀鲁豫出发，挺进豫东，这就是豫皖苏的中心区，当时很快就建立了八个敌后抗日民主县政权。而新四军第四师师长兼淮北军区司令员彭云枫同志，便在这次解放豫皖苏边人民的战斗中光荣殉国！为了纪念这位民族英雄，那里的人民便把彭师长殉国的永城县，改为雪枫县。
    经过半年的创建，豫皖苏解放区巩固起来了。到一九四五年一月间，仅彭雪枫部下便和日伪军进行了一百八十三次战斗，拔除敌据点三十九个，毙伤日军中队长、县顾问以下九十八名，活捉两名，毙伤伪大队长县长以下五百九十二名，活捉一千一百五十名，反正的四十七名。到四、五月间，更东袭淮北重镇任集，活捉伪十五师团长任亚航以下五百多人；西渡新黄河、横扫敌伪据点，连克鄢陵尉氏间的柴庄、南曹、黄龙店、商水、上蔡间的砖桥镇，王亭寺等重要村镇；八月初，达生（新设县）大队更以六十里的强行军，挺进到陇海路上、开封以西十五里的杏花营和开封、朱仙镇间的何楼一带，痛歼该地的日军守备部队和伪保甲自卫团。
    日本投降时，蒋介石却让日伪军替他“维持秩序”，深深的激怒了豫皖苏人民，他们轮起拳头高呼：“干啊！”于是乎，千百个民兵，千百付担架，紧随着自己的子弟兵新四军、八路军上前线，于是乎，开封、雪枫、太康、杞县等县城和广大的国土都已解放了，汉奸刽子手杜春台等就擒的就擒、死的死了。
    豫皖苏人民正待舒舒展展地松一口气，在共产党民主政府领导下，建设自己和平幸福生活的时候，蒋介石卖国独裁内战的炮火，又指向着豫皖苏人民。去年——一九四六年五月到六月，蒋介石用了八十一师、一八一师等二万余人的兵力，反复“清剿”豫皖苏的腹心地区，强占去杞县、太康、扶沟、陈留等三百一十二座城镇。紧接着，六月下旬又来了个第二次“清剿”。蒋介石企图一下就把豫皖苏解放区摧毁了，特地给八十一师等配制了十辆美制坦克、四十辆军用汽车，还有其他许多重火器。
    但是胜利的不是蒋介石，而是豫皖苏全体军民。去年八月，正当蒋军向北推进的时候，豫皖苏人民武装和刘伯承将军率领的大军遥相呼应，一举攻入蒋军内部神经中枢之一的开封飞机场，解放开封以南中国四大镇之一的朱仙镇。光复杞县之役，更将蒋军八十一师的精锐歼灭。乃至于本月五日起五天收复杞县、太康、鹿邑、柘城、亳县、宁陵、睢县等七座县城。更证明这广大区域最后终将属于人民。这些县城，最近都因战略关系主动撤出了，但蒋军进入留下的空城，却更增加被歼的机会。
    前年——一九四五年十一月十四日，美国纽约下午报曾经刊载一个美国兵的家信，其中有一段提及他在豫皖苏黄泛区的见闻说：“在你可以看到的每一个方面，都是一片水，水里只有一些小岛，上面有树木和房子，他们的整个田地都浸在水里，我不知道他们怎样生活！我想鸡、鸭、猪以及家庭手工业，大概都浸在水里！”其实，在抗日战争最艰苦的岁月里，豫皖苏军民只有五个村的抗日民主根据地，而这些村子全都是在那个美国兵所说的水乡里。忠诚于民族解放事业的共产党员、八路军、新四军和民主政府的工作人员们，不仅能在这样艰苦的环境里坚持抗日斗争，亲自动手解决困难，还帮助群众种地锄苗。一九四四年新四军彭师大军西进，拯救豫皖苏人民时，一面打仗，一面还播种了一百多亩高粱地，后来又把荒芜无人的泛区里四二○六亩山川、蒿地，全部变成了良田。逃荒在外的群众纷纷扶老携幼归来，在民主政府帮助下重建家园。
    现在，这块灌溉着彭雪枫将军的血、流传着王康太、李连生等渡河杀敌英雄名字的土地上，豫皖苏军民正在和冀鲁豫、山东、苏皖解放区的军民配合作战，在这次自卫战争中，它随时可以刺穿蒋军的脊背。
