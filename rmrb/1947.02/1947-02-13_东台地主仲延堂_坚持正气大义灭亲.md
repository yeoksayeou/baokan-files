Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th -- Mr. Zhong Yantang, a landlord in Dongtai, upholds righteousness and kills his own relatives. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded his hometown of Jiuzhao, Mr. Zhong dispersed and buried his family's property. He also persuaded his wife to move to a safe area. His younger brother and nephew repeatedly urged him to join the Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home Corps," but he sternly refused, saying, "I am Chinese, and if I die, I will die in the Liberated Area, which advocates patriotism, peace, and democracy." The Chiang Kai-shek troops demolished his house to build a bunker, and he said angrily, "The counter-offensive will come sooner or later." Not many days later, the Chiang Kai-shek bunker in Jiuzhao was destroyed by the local guerrillas, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops were forced to retreat. Mr. Zhong said with a smile, "I, Zhong Yantang, am still Zhong Yantang, but the bunker is gone." His younger brother, Zhong Yanbao, colluded with the "Returning Home Corps" and committed many evils, causing everyone to gnash their teeth. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops were defeated and retreated, Zhong Yanbao attempted to hide at home, saying to Mr. Zhong, "Second Brother! I am family, right?" Mr. Zhong scolded angrily, "What family? Those who are running dogs of the reactionaries are enemies of everyone."

    坚持正气大义灭亲
    【新华社华中十一日电】东台地主仲延堂先生，坚持正气大义灭亲。仲先生当蒋军侵至其家乡九灶时即将家中财物疏散埋藏，并说服其夫人转移至安全地带，其弟其侄先后劝他参加蒋记“还乡团”均被严词拒绝，他说：“我是中国人死也要死在主张爱国和平民主的解放区”。蒋军将其家宅拆毁筑碉堡，他愤怒的说：“反攻胜利总要到来的”，没隔几天，九灶蒋军碉堡即为当地游击队所摧毁，蒋军被迫退走。仲先生笑着说：“我仲延堂还是仲延堂，碉堡却没有了。”其弟仲延宝勾结“还乡团”作恶多端，人人切齿，蒋军败退时，仲延宝企图到家躲藏，向仲先生说：“二哥！我是家里人吧！”仲先生怒骂道：“什么家里人，当反动派走狗的都是大家的敌人。”
