Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang, 16th—The Yan'an sympathy delegation has arrived in Wenshui, Jinzhong, which was newly recovered. Citizens have been visiting the delegation in a continuous stream these days, accusing Yan Xishan of his crimes. Citizen Zhang Shuwen grabbed Battalion Commander Cui Tianfu's hand and said, "Last October, the Gouzi soldiers (the local people's name for Yan's army) took my son away, and his life and death are still unknown. My son is only seventeen years old!" Zhang Shuwen built bunkers for the Gouzi soldiers for half a year last year, and the land at home was all deserted. Wu Zhaolun is an old man in his sixties. He said that from the fifth month to the twelfth month of the lunar calendar last year, the people in the city were caught to build bunkers and dig trenches every day, and they were not even allowed to go home for lunch. People of his age were also beaten by the Gouzi soldiers. After Wenshui was recovered, Old Man Wu received three dan of relief grain. He said, "I would have starved to death if the Eighth Route Army hadn't entered the city." According to the peddler Feng Lichang, since September last year, they have been taking turns guarding the city wall every night, once every three days, and many people have fallen ill from the cold. The farmer Xiang Jiqing complained: "One tael of silver grain costs two shi three dou and five sheng of wheat. In addition, each mu of land has to produce six taels of cotton, one chi two cun of homespun cloth, and 250,000 yuan in funds. There are also household donations, ranging from 15,000 to 30,000, and each household is assigned one or three railway sleepers, each costing 15,000." They place infinite hope on the Yan'an sympathy delegation. They said, "You must tell Chairman Mao, please let the Eighth Route Army overthrow Yan Xishan quickly, the people are really unable to survive under his oppression!" (Hai Leng)

　　文水人民访延安慰问团
    控诉阎锡山罪行
    【新华社吕梁十六日电】延安慰问团已抵达新收复之晋中文水城，连日市民络绎访问该团，控诉阎锡山统治的罪行。市民张书文拉着崔田夫营长的手说：“去年十月勾子军（当地人民给阎军的称呼）把我的儿子抓走了，至今生死不明，我的儿子才十七岁呀！”张书文去年给勾子军修了半年碉堡，家里的土地都荒芜了。武兆伦是一个六十多岁的老汉，他说从去年阴历五月到腊月，城里的老百姓天天被抓去修碉堡挖战壕，连吃午饭都不让回家，像他这样的年纪也挨了勾子军的打。文水收复后，武老汉得到三石救济粮，他说：“八路军再不进城我就要饿死了。”据小贩冯立昌说，从去年九月起他们每晚轮流到城墙上守夜，三天轮一次，许多人冻病了。农民向吉庆诉说：“一两银粮出两石三斗五升麦子，此外每亩地还要出六两棉花，一尺二寸土布，二百五千元款；还有户口捐，少则一万五，多则三万，每户被摊派了一根或三根枕木，每根又是一万五。”他们对延安慰问团寄予无限希望，他们说：“你们千万告诉毛主席，请八路军赶快把阎锡山打倒吧，老百姓被他逼得实在活不下了！”（海棱）
