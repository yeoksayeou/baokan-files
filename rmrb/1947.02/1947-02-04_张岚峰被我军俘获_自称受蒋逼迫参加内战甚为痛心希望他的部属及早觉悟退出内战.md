[This dispatch from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 2nd by our correspondent, although] (Delayed) Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the Third Security Column of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense, was captured by the Eighth Route Army and has now arrived at the rear of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. When the Eighth Route Army besieged Jinxiang, Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong repeatedly ordered Zhang Lanfeng to personally lead one regiment each from his First and Second Detachments to aid Jinxiang from the east, coordinating with Fang Xianjue's 88th Division to attack us. When they advanced to Datianji near the west of Jinxiang, they were completely annihilated. Although Zhang Lanfeng himself once escaped the encirclement with a small number of followers, he was finally intercepted by our local troops near Chengwu. After being escorted, on January 21st, General Liu Bocheng sent a special car to pick him up to his field headquarters. Mr. Zhang is short and stout, 45 years old, from Zhecheng, Henan. He served as a cadet under Mr. Feng Yuxiang in his early years. In the 14th year of the Republic, he was sent to Japan to study at the military academy. After returning, he served as the commander of the artillery regiment of the Northwest Army. During the Jiang-Feng War, he served as the principal of the Northwest Army Military Academy. In the 21st year, he went to Tokyo again to study economics at Waseda University. After the July 7th Incident, he served as the commander-in-chief of the puppet Second Army Group in Nanjing. When Mr. Zhang arrived at General Liu Bocheng's field headquarters, it was Lunar New Year's Eve. The weather was cold, and it was snowing heavily. Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Military Region, had known Mr. Zhang in the 26th Route Army of the Northwest Army. Seeing that Mr. Zhang was only wearing an ordinary soldier's gray short military uniform on his upper body and thin riding pants on his lower body, he took off his own leather overcoat and gave it to Mr. Zhang to keep warm. On New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, General Liu Bocheng and General Deng Xiaoping hosted Mr. Zhang twice, and the hosts and guests were very happy. When reporters visited, Mr. Zhang was in high spirits and talked freely about why the Third Column he led could still exist in the past. The main reason was that Chiang's side wanted to fight a civil war, and they believed that the column could still be used by them. When the Japanese devils surrendered, the unit had a total of 36 regiments, about 90,000 people. Last spring, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the reduction to 50,000, but then came another order, giving only six regimental designations, about 20,000 people. Mr. Zhang said that the result of the downsizing was that more than 600 officers under his command lost their jobs. Although the team was about to be completed, they did not pay wages until after the Longhai Campaign began last August, when Chiang Kai-shek began to pay wages and repeatedly ordered an attack on the Eighth Route Army. Mr. Zhang said, "Under such coercion, we participated in the civil war of mutual slaughter. This time, Jinxiang was in a tight spot, and we were ordered to come to aid, knowing that there would be no good results, but there was nothing we could do." Mr. Zhang continued, saying that the crimes and stains of the enemy and puppet period had not yet been washed away, and new crimes of civil war had been added, which was very painful. Finally, when the reporter asked how to deal with the remaining troops under his command, he said very sincerely: "There is still a part of the Third Security Column left in the area of Zhecheng, south of the Longhai Road. I only hope that they will recognize the current situation and awaken as soon as possible, putting the country, the nation, and the people first, so that they will no longer be used by others, be enemies of the people, and become sacrifices in the civil war."

　　张岚峰被我军俘获
    自称受蒋逼迫参加内战甚为痛心希望他的部属及早觉悟退出内战
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】（迟到）蒋介石国防部保安第三纵队司令张岚峰被八路军俘获，现已到达晋冀鲁豫军区后方。在八路军围困金乡时，蒋介石、顾祝同再三督令张岚峰亲率其第一、第二支队各一个团，东援金乡，配合八十八师方先觉部向我进攻，当其进至金乡以西大田集附近时，即遭全部覆灭。张岚峰本人虽曾带少数随从一度逃出重围，终在城武附近被我地方部队截获，经转辗护送，至一月二十一日由刘伯承将军派专车接至其野战司令部。张氏身材矮胖，现年四十五岁，河南柘城人，早年在冯玉祥先生部下当学兵，民国十四年送日本入士官学校，归来任西北军炮兵团长，蒋、冯战争时任西北军军官学校校长，二十一年再度东渡入东京早稻田大学学习经济。七七事变后，任南京伪第二集团军总司令。张氏抵达刘伯承将军野战司令部时，正值旧历除夕，岁暮天寒，大雪纷飞，军区李达参谋长原在西北军二十六路军与张氏有旧交，及见张氏上身仅着普通士兵灰色短军服，下身着单薄马裤，当将自己的皮大衣脱下，送给张氏御寒。除夕及元旦日，刘伯承将军与邓小平将军等曾两度欢宴张氏，宾主颇为欢洽。记者往访时，张氏精神焕发，围炉畅谈其所率之第三纵队过去所以还能存在，主要是蒋方要打内战，认为该纵队还可供他们驱使。日寇投降时，该部共有三十六个团，约九万人，去春蒋介石下令缩编为五万，但随即又来命令，只给六个团的番号，约两万人。张氏称，缩编结果，使其部下六百余军官失业，队伍虽然快编完了，但又不发饷，直至去年八月陇海战役开始后，蒋介石始一面发饷，一面再三督令进攻八路军。张氏说：“就在这样逼迫下，我们才参加了自相残杀的内战。这次金乡吃紧，复奉命来援，明知不会有好结果，但又无可如何。”张氏继称，敌伪时之罪过与污点尚没有洗清，复又添上内战新的罪过，甚为痛心。最后记者询以对其所余部队如何处理时，他很诚挚的说：“保安第三纵队还有一部留在陇海路南柘城一带，我只希望他们认清时局，及早觉悟，以国家民族和人民为重，要不再被人利用，与人民为敌，作内战的牺牲品。”
