　　Yanggu Lets Go and Does It in a Big Way, Setting Fires Everywhere
    Over Four Hundred Villages Drawn into Struggle
    [Our newspaper's telegram from Jilu豫, 16th] Under the guiding ideology of letting go and doing it in a big way, the Yanggu land-to-the-tiller movement has unfolded on a large scale. More than 430 villages in the county have been drawn into the tide of struggle, and a total of 893 struggles against traitorous despots, landlords, and secret agents have been carried out, yielding a large number of fruits. According to statistics from seven districts (missing the third and ninth districts), more than 21,000 mu of land have returned to the people, as well as more than 300 cattle and horses, more than 1,000 houses, and a large amount of other grain and vehicles. In the struggle, peasant organizations have expanded from more than 10,000 people to more than 40,000 people. Even in the old liberated areas before the struggle, feudal forces were still very powerful. For example, in the fourth district, which has more than six years of work history, there were still 54 ultra-poor households and 23 feudal landlord households in the 71 villages of the district. Since the beginning of the self-defense war, evil influences have risen even further. Landlord Lang went to the peasants' fields on purpose to check on them and threaten the masses. In the new areas, secret agents were active, and the remnants of the enemy and puppets colluded with feudal landlords to maintain feudal rule, and the masses dared not move. In Xihu Township, in the first district, just as a peasant association was about to be established, an activist was assassinated by a secret agent. Coupled with the burden of war service, the masses were passive and indifferent, while the county leadership's thinking was "rather do less but do it well." Cadres who went to the villages did not dare to let go and do it in a big way, but instead moved cautiously and individually. In Taihai Village, in the sixth district, poor peasants actively demanded struggle, but we went to hold a forum with middle peasants. The middle peasants dodged and were unwilling to listen, and the poor peasants' enthusiasm cooled down. Later, the county party committee made a review, clarifying two new spirits: First, let go and do it in a big way, shout loudly, and make full use of administrative power. Second, boldly move "stones," remove all concerns of the masses, fully organize forces, comprehensively mobilize the masses, and set fires everywhere. Cadres went deep down to listen to the voices of the masses. The masses demanded to kill the extremely evil traitor Hao Daopeng, and immediately organized a public trial meeting of more than 2,000 people, with more than 20 victims complaining. He was shot on the spot, and the masses' emotions rose. Those attending the meeting during the day in Ningchang Village struggled in their own village at night. Within three days, more than 20 villages in the whole sub-district were shocked. The first district held a peasant conference of 1,300 people, and a joint struggle meeting of 6,000 people. These mass meetings created an atmosphere of enthusiasm for turning over. The old, tired fourth district convened a peasant conference of more than 1,500 people, and more than 30 villages carried out joint struggles. The atmosphere of land returning to the people swept through like a storm.

　　阳谷放手大干到处点火
    四百余村卷入斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】在放手大干的指导思想下，阳谷土地还家运动已大规模展开。全县四百三十余村群众卷入斗争热潮，先后共斗争奸霸地主特务八百九十三次，获得了大批果实。据七个区（缺三、九区）的统计，即有土地二万一千余亩回家，及牛马三百余头，房屋一千余间，其他粮食、车辆等很多。斗争中农民组织扩大了，由一万多人发展到四万多人。在斗争前即在老区封建势力仍很强大，如六年多工作历史的四区，全区七十一个村尚有赤贫五十四户，封建地主二十三户。自卫战争开始，邪气更抬头了，郎某某地主，故意到农民地里去查看威胁群众。新区则特务活跃，敌伪残余勾结封建地主，保持封建统治，群众不敢活动，一区西湖乡刚要成立农会，积极分子便被特务暗杀了。加以战勤负担，群众消极冷淡，县领导思想上却是“宁愿搞少要搞好”。干部到村不敢放手大干，而是小手小脚个别的动员。六区泰海村贫农积极要求斗争，而我们却去召集中农座谈会，中农躲躲闪闪不愿听，贫农情绪放冷了。以后县委曾作了检讨，明确了两个新精神：一、放手大干，大喊大叫，充分运用行政力量。二、大胆搬“石头”，解除群众中的一切顾虑，全力组织力量，全面发动群众，到处点火。干部深入下去听取群众呼声，群众要求杀罪大恶极的汉奸郝道鹏，当即组织了两千多人的公审大会，有二十多个苦主诉苦，当场把他枪毙了，群众情绪高涨起来。宁昌村白天参加大会，晚上本村斗争，三天内全小区二十多个村轰动了。一区更举行了千三百人的农民会议，和六千人联合斗争大会，这些群众性的大会造成了翻身热气。老疲塌的四区，召集了千五百多人的农民会议，三十多个村进行了联合斗争。土地还家的空气，像暴风样刮起来了。
