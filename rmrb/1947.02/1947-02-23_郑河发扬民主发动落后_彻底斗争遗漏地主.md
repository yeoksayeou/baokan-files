　　[Reported from Jinnan on the 21st of this month] In Wei County, Zhenghe has promoted a democratic style of work, mobilized the backward masses, and smoothly launched the investigation of omitted landlords. Farmers in Zhenghe Village educated backward members at group meetings. Wang Peixian resolved to no longer inform the landlords, Wu Wenlin reported that the landlord Wu Sanfeng had hidden a table at his house, and Wu Lizhong reported that he had hidden a rolling mill belonging to the landlord Wu Binhou. Because democracy was promoted in the village, many activists emerged. For example, Wang Huayuan, Wu Zirong, and Wang Youjia have been earnest and democratic in their work from being group leaders to being elected as representatives, and they have won the support of the masses. Old activist Wang Yongsi performed best in the last mass movement, and is also very active this time. Due to the full mobilization of the masses, village cadres and activists have established an excellent style of work. Old activist Ma Xiaofan said: "Previously, a few people took over everything, which easily led to factionalism. Now, after discussions and resolutions by the masses, no one is provoking trouble anymore, because the power of the masses is greater, and even if they provoke, they cannot stir anything up." During the New Year, the landlords, in order to win over village cadres and mass leaders Ma Xiaofan and Wu Sanwei, sent two catties of mutton. Landlords in the west street sent chickens, cigarettes, and wine to host feasts, but were firmly rejected. The village has identified twelve households of omitted landlords and is now conducting struggles against them.

    【本报冀南二十一日电】威县郑河发扬民主作风，发动落后群众，对遗漏地主的清查顺利展开。郑河村农民在小组会上对落后会员进行了教育，王佩显决心不再给地主报讯，武文林报出地主武三峰藏他家一张桌子，武力仲报出藏地主武彬厚轧车一辆。该村由于发扬了民主，涌现出很多积极分子，如王化元、吴子荣、王有家从当组长到当选代表，一直办事认真，作风民主，深得群众拥护。老积极分子王用思，上次群运时表现最好，这次也很积极。由于群众的充分发动，村干积极分子都建立了优良作风，老积极分子马笑范说：“先前几个人包办，好闹宗派，现在经群众讨论议决，再没人挑弄事了，因为群众力量大了，挑弄也挑弄不动。”过年时，地主为了收买村干及群众领袖马笑范、武三维，送了二斤羊肉，西街地主送鸡子、烟、酒请客，都被坚决拒绝了。该村已清查出十二户遗漏地主，现正进行斗争。
