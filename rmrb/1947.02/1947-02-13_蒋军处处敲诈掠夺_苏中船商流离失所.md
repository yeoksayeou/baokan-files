    Chiang's Troops Extort and Plunder Everywhere
    Suzhong Ship Merchants Displaced

    [Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong, 7th] Ship merchants from the Suzhong Liberated Area who went out to do business have been looted by Chiang's troops, and a large number have been displaced. More than fifty shipowners from the coastal ports of Dongtai have been doing business in Shanghai, Wusong, Changshu, and other places since November of last year, and there has been no news of them since. According to Chen Jinghai, who recently returned from Jiangnan, "It is said that the famous shipowner Gu Yonghai took goods worth 35 million 法币 (legal tender) to the Jinghu area for business in early October of last year and made a considerable profit. Zhang Yingzhi and Xu Yachang, personnel from the Chiang army garrison headquarters, took the opportunity to extort money, deliberately accusing him of transporting military supplies for the New Fourth Army, and subjected him to torture and imprisonment for two months. Gu spent 28 million 法币 before he was released. Others, such as fisherman Gu Qihua, whose three generations of grandparents depended on two fishing boats for a living, were extorted millions of 法币 in Shanghai this time, and even his wife was seized by Chiang's troops. Shipowner Wang Youwen, a family of six, was extorted three times by Chiang's troops in Wusong in two months. In the end, he had to pay off his debts with the only remaining merchant ship worth 200 dan of rice, and is now wandering overseas without a livelihood. Wang Dezai was extorted when he transported goods to Wusong. After returning, he had no way to make a living. The Jianghai Company of the democratic government immediately provided relief with eight dan of cotton to help him revitalize his business. Currently, shipowners Cui Guangru, Zhong Dekuan, and others who are still drifting in Shanghai, Changshu, and other places are also often extorted by Chiang's troops, who demand dozens or even hundreds of shi of grain. Human rights and property rights are not guaranteed at all."

    蒋军处处敲诈掠夺
    苏中船商流离失所
    【新华社苏中七日电】苏中解放区出外经营之船商，遭蒋军掠夺，大批流离失所。东台沿海之海港，五十余名船主，自去年十一月间陆续至上海、吴淞、常熟等地经商，至今音信断绝，近据江南返里之陈景海称：“闻名之大船主顾永海，于去年十月初旬，携价值三千五百万法币之货物，至京沪一带营业，盈利甚丰，蒋军卫戍司令部人员张营之、徐亚常，乘机敲诈，故意加以新四军转运军用品之罪名，并施苦刑，监禁两月，顾先后花费二千八百万元始得释放。其他如渔民顾其华，祖孙三代依赖两只渔船度活，此次在上海被敲诈数百万元，连其妻亦为蒋军霸占。船主王有文，一家六口，在吴淞两个月，即被蒋军敲诈三次，最后只得以仅剩之价值二百担大米之商船抵债，近流浪海外生活无着。王得斋贩货到吴淞，横遭勒索，回来后已无法生活，民主政府江海公司，即救济棉花八担，协助其重振营业。目前尚飘泊上海常熟等地之船主崔光如、钟得宽等，亦常遭蒋军敲诈，动辄就得数十石以至百石粮食奉献，人权财权毫无保障。
