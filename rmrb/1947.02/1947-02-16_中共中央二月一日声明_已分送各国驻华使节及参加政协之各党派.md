Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 14th: The February 1st statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the non-recognition of any foreign agreements concluded unilaterally by the Chiang Kai-shek government after the Political Consultative Conference without the consent of all parties of the Political Consultative Conference has been sent by General Zhou Enlai with a letter to foreign envoys in China, all parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference, and all members of the Political Consultative Conference, and all have been dispatched. According to a Nanjing dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek, convener of the Political Consultative Conference, returned the statement to the Nanjing Liaison Office of the Chinese Communist Party on the 12th, three days after receiving it. This once again proves that Chiang Kai-shek has absolutely no respect for the Political Consultative Conference, the highest provisional representative body in China recognized by the world.

　　中共中央二月一日声明
    已分送各国驻华使节
    及参加政协之各党派
    【新华社延安十四日电】中共中央委员会二月一日关于不承认政治协商会议以后蒋介石政府不得政治协商会议各党派同意而单独订立的任何对外协定之声明，已由周恩来将军备函分送各国驻华使节、参加政协各党派及政协各会员，均已发出。据南京讯：政治协商会议召集人蒋介石于收阅后三天之十二日，将该项声明退回南京中共联络处。由此再度证明蒋介石对于全世界所公认的中国最高临时代议机关之政治协商会议已丝毫无尊重之意。
