    The Landlord's Vision of Turning to Industry
    ——A Visit to Mr. Zhuang Xiaoguang
    Hong Liu

    "The path of Zhang Yongtai in Yan'an is the path that all seventy-one landlords of Datian should take. I am preparing to gradually move towards running a cooperative textile factory based on my family," said Mr. Zhuang Xiaoguang, a senator who used to own over a thousand acres of land, as he led the reporter to visit his small-scale family textile factory. This consisted of two and a half spacious and bright rooms, with two large iron weaving machines, a newly made wooden cotton gin bow, a flat cotton spinning wheel, and large bales of newly ginned cotton. He approached the cotton gin bow, stroked his beard, and said, "Ninety percent of the landlord families in Datian are now spinning thread, and several families are weaving cloth, all having bought large iron machines. Some hire workers to weave, while others weave and starch the cloth themselves, and the money earned from weaving is enough to feed and clothe the whole family." He showed the reporter the cotton gin bow made according to his specifications, saying, "This was purchased jointly with Senator Zhuang Bocai of Lindetang, costing a total of 50,000 Northern Currency. Our intention is not only to make money, but also to enable the young people of the landlord families in Datian to learn some textile skills and cultivate textile talents." After visiting the factory, Mr. Zhuang led the reporter back to his room, where he discussed the income from textile production: "Running a textile business is a steady and practical approach. My two iron machines can weave twenty bolts of homespun cloth per month. Each bolt sells for 10,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan. On the cost side, twenty bolts of cloth require 145,000 yuan for thread, 7,600 yuan for the two weaving workers including food and wages, and 4,600 yuan for miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, the net profit from weaving each month is 41,000 yuan, which is enough to feed and clothe my family of six." At this moment, sunlight streamed in through the glass window, shining on Mr. Zhuang's daughter, Daju, who was wearing new cotton clothes and bursting into the room, singing: "My brother is in the Children's Corps, my sister is in the literacy class..." Behind her were her brother, sister-in-law, and second sister-in-law, all wearing brand new cotton clothes. Mr. Zhuang looked at his children and happily said, "Landlords turning to the textile industry is a broad and prosperous road. Last year, I added a cotton gin bow, and this year I will buy a cotton ginning machine, and a small-scale textile factory will be established." (Shandong News)

    ——访庄晓光先生
    洪流
    “延安张永泰的道路，是我们大店七十一家堂号所有地主都应走的道路，我正准备从家庭的基础上，逐渐走向办合作纺织工厂。”旧日拥有千余亩土地的四余堂地主庄晓光参议员，边谈边引记者去参观他的小型家庭纺织工厂。这是两间半宽大明亮的房屋，屋里摆着两张大铁机，一张年前赶制的木装弹花弓，一个平搭纺花车，和新弹的大包棉花。他走近弹花弓，抚摸着胡须说：“我们大店的地主家庭，现在已有百分之九十纺线了，织布的也有好几家，都各买有大铁机。有的雇工织，有的自己织、自己浆，织布挣的钱都够一家人吃穿。”他让记者细看那架依他心意制造的弹花弓，他说：“这是同林德堂庄伯才参议员合股买的，共花五万元北币。我们的用意不只是为了赚钱，也因为要使大店地主的青年子弟们学些纺织业的本领，培养纺织人才。”参观工厂后，庄先生又引记者回到他的房里，他和记者谈起纺织获得的情形：“办纺织是稳扎稳打的办法，我的两架铁机，每月能织二十匹土布，一匹卖一万元，共能卖二十万元。在成本方面，二十匹布共需线钱十四万五千元，两个织布工人，连吃带工资共需七千六百元，杂支四千六百元，计每月织布能净赚四万一千元，足够我一家大小六口的吃穿。”这时，阳光从玻璃窗上透进来来照在正闯进室来的庄先生的女孩大莒的新棉衣上，她正高唱：“哥哥是儿童团，妹妹是识字班………………”走在后面的，是她的哥哥、大嫂与二嫂，他们也都穿着崭新的棉衣。庄先生看着他的孩子们，高兴的说：“地主转向纺织工业，是一条康庄大道，我去年添置了弹花弓，今年再买个轧花机，一个小规模的纺织工厂就开办起来了。”（山东通讯）
