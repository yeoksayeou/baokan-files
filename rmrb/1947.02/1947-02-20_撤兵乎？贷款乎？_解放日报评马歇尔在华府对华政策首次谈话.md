Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. *Liberation Daily* here published yesterday an editorial entitled "Withdraw Troops or Grant Loans?" criticizing Marshall's policy statement on China at his first press conference in Washington on the 9th of this month, pointing out that Marshall's statement exposed the American imperialists' desire to ease the opposition of the Chinese and world people in order to further gain convenience in dealing with the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March. The editorial stated: "No one would doubt that Marshall's departure from China and the dissolution of the Executive Headquarters marked the initial failure of American imperialism's policy toward China. The reason for the failure of this policy was definitely not, as Marshall said when he left China, 'the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party,' but rather that American imperialism's policy of aggression against China, like the previous Japanese imperialism's policy of aggression against China, had suffered resolute and stubborn resistance from the entire Chinese people, and had suffered opposition from the American people and all democratic people in the world."

The newspaper pointed out: "In the past three months, especially since November of last year, the victorious patriotic self-defense war of the military and civilians in the liberated areas and the demands of the entire Chinese people for the withdrawal of American troops from China for several months, especially the patriotic student movement at the end of last year demanding that American troops 'get out' which swept across twenty-four cities in China, undoubtedly were the most important and direct factors forcing the failure of American imperialism's policy of intervention."

The newspaper pointed out that Marshall's statement proved the fact that the U.S. military's attempt to station troops in China for a long time was certain. The editorial dismissed Marshall's claims that the purpose of the U.S. military's stay in China was to "assist in training the Chinese Navy to defend China's coastal areas from piracy and smuggling" and that Qingdao had "deep water and a large sea surface, where the Seventh Fleet is stationed." The editorial stated: What is meant by "assisting in training the Chinese Navy"? That is to seize China's naval bases and control China's entire territorial waters. As for the so-called "defense of China's coastal areas from piracy and smuggling," that is even more shameful and ridiculous! Who doesn't know that since the Japanese aggressors were driven away, it is none other than the American air and naval personnel and the Chiang clique's comprador bureaucrats colluding with American warlords who are engaged in piracy-style smuggling in the coastal areas of China. Because Chiang Kai-shek sold out all of China's navigation rights, American-made and American planes can run rampant everywhere without any registration or inspection by the Chinese side, carrying smuggled goods. For example, the three Robert Wien brothers, international smuggling kingpins arrested in Shanghai on August 14 last year, used their status as U.S. naval and air force personnel to engage in import and export smuggling. U.S. military aircraft flying from India and Manila freely sell smuggled goods, and no one dares to question them. The startling smuggling case of the "Linsen Fleet," composed of eight dilapidated small American ships established with American help, further proves who is really helping smuggling. As for Marshall's statement that Qingdao has "deep water and a large sea surface, where the Seventh Fleet is stationed," that is even more absurd. The United States has many ports with wide and deep waters. If Britain or the Soviet Union did not want to deploy a fleet, but only deployed one warship to "station there," saying it was to defend the United States from pirates and smugglers, how would the Americans feel? The American imperialists are really bullying the Chinese too much.

Regarding the 500 million dollar loan, the newspaper believed that this was another proof that the U.S. government had not acted in accordance with its own announced policy of December 25, 1945. The editorial pointed out: "The U.S. government has already given Chiang Kai-shek $66 million in loans and $855 million in surplus materials in the past year. It is also widely rumored that the United States will transfer a large amount of Lend-Lease materials stored in India and the Philippines to Chiang Kai-shek. It is with the help of the U.S. government, as well as other major assistance in military, political, and economic aspects, that Chiang Kai-shek has forced China not to move towards 'peace and unity,' but towards all-out civil war and all-out division; not to end but to prolong as much as possible the 'one-party government.' The result of the U.S. government's aid is definitely not, as Truman said more than a year ago, to help China 'rebuild its country, improve its agricultural and industrial economy,' and achieve 'the development of a sound economy for all of China and sound trade relations between China and the United States.' On the contrary, the result of U.S. financial aid to Chiang has led to the total outbreak of the financial and economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today. Regarding this crisis, even the most conservative New York Times said: 'China's bankruptcy will not only be an economic bankruptcy, it may mean a social and political bankruptcy.' The reason is just as the U.S. Foreign Policy Association's report in January of this year said: 'The United States should be held responsible for China's current economic difficulties and civil war.'"

The newspaper concluded: "The Chinese people know very well that this new loan from the United States, like its previous aid to Chiang, will only continue to expand China's civil war and further deepen China's financial and economic crisis, and therefore will inevitably be strongly opposed by the Chinese people. If the American imperialists' policy of intervention over the past year has already failed miserably, then what reason is there to determine that it can succeed in the future?"

　　撤兵乎？贷款乎？
    解放日报评马歇尔在华府对华政策首次谈话
    【新华社延安十八日电】此间解放日报昨日发表题为《撤兵乎？贷款乎？》之社论，批评本月九日马歇尔在华盛顿首次记者招待会中对华政策之谈话，指出马氏谈话暴露了美国帝国主义者想缓和一下中国和全世界人民的反对，进一步取得应付三月莫斯科外长会议的方便。社论称：“谁都不会怀疑马歇尔的离华和军调部的撤消，标志着美国帝国主义对华政策的初次失败，使这一政策失败的原因，决不是马歇尔离华时所说的什么“国共双方之猜疑”，而是美国帝国主义的侵华政策，如同以往日本帝国主义的侵华政策一样，遭受到了全中国人民坚决顽强的反抗，并遭受到了美国人民和全世界一切民主人士的反对。”
    该报指出：“三个月来，特别从去年十一月以来，解放区军民胜利的爱国自卫战争和几个月来全中国人民要求美军撤退中国，特别是去年年底遍及中国二十四个城市的要求美军“滚出去”的学生爱国运动，决无疑义是迫使美国帝国主义干涉政策失败的最重要与最直接的因素。”
    该报指出马氏谈话证明了这一事实：即美军企图长期驻华是确定的了。社论对于马氏所谓美军留华目的在“协助训练中国海军，以防御中国沿海地带之海盗及走私行为”及青岛“海水深，海面大，第七舰队即停泊该地”云云，认为不值一驳。社论称：什么叫做“协助训练中国海军”？那就是攫取中国的海军基地，控制中国的全部领海。至于所谓“防御中国沿海地带之海盗及走私行为”，那就更加可耻和可笑了！谁不知道从日本侵略者被赶走以后，在中国沿海地带做海盗式的走私勾当的不是别人，正就是美国的海空军人员以及与美国军阀勾结的蒋记买办官僚。由于蒋介石出卖了中国的全部航权，以致美制美机可以不经过中国方面的任何登记与检查，在各处横冲直撞，夹带私货。例如去年八月十四日，在上海被捕的国际走私要犯罗勃温三兄弟，就是利用他们身为美海空军人员的地位经营出入口走私的。由印度、马尼剌飞来的美国军用机，自由销售私货，无人敢予过问。而由美国帮助建立由八艘美国破旧小型舰所组成的“林森舰队”的惊人走私案，更证明了谁在真正帮助走私。至于马歇尔所说青岛“海水深，海面大，第七舰队即停泊该地”，那就更加荒唐了。美国港阔水深的港口也多得很，如果英国或苏联不要开一个舰队、而仅仅开一艘军舰“停泊该地”，也说是为了替美国防御海盗和走私，请问美国人又将作何感想？美帝国主义者真把中国人欺得太厉害了。
    关于五亿元贷款问题，该报认为这是美国政府一点没有照它于一九四五年十二月二十五日自己宣布的政策办事的又一明证。社论指出：“美国政府在去年一年内，即已给了蒋介石六千六百万美元的借款，八亿五千五百万美元的剩余物资，最近还盛传美国将以存在印度与菲律宾的大量租借物资转借给蒋介石。蒋介石就靠着美国政府的这些帮助以及其他在军事政治经济各方面的重大帮助，才迫使中国不是向“和平及团结”前进，而是向全面内战与全面分裂前进；不是结束而是尽量延续“一党政府”。美国政府这样援助的结果，也决不如杜鲁门在一年多前所说的是帮助中国做到“重建其国家，改进其农业及工业经济”，做到“有助于全中国健全之经济及中美间健全贸易关系之发展”。恰恰相反，美国财政援蒋之结果，促成了今天国民党统治区的财政经济危机之总爆发。关于这个危机，连最保守的纽约时报也说：“中国破产将不仅是经济破产，它可能意味着社会和政治的破产”。其原因则正如今年一月份美国外交政策协会的报告所说：“美国应对中国目前的经济困难和内战负责”。
    该报结论：“中国人民知道得很清楚，美国的这笔新借款将和它历次援蒋一样，只是继续扩大中国的内战，更加加深中国财政经济的危机，因此必然遭到中国人民强烈的反对。假如说美国帝国主义一年多来的干涉政策已经惨败了，那末今后还有什么理由可以断定它能够成功？
