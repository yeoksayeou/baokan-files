　　How to Treat Scabies?
    Those who have suffered from scabies often say: "Treating scabies is not difficult, but eradicating it is." The fundamental reason is still the treatment method. Simple scabies will not turn into pustules. The reason for pustules is unclean skin and unclipped fingernails, often scratching the scabies, allowing pyogenic bacteria to invade the scabies and become pustular scabies. The general treatment method is to apply some ointment to the affected area, but neglecting the fact that bacteria can spread all over the body through lice, fingers, clothes, and bedding, so it cannot be eradicated. Based on my personal experience with scabies and its treatment, whether it is dry scabies or pustular scabies, comprehensive treatment should be implemented. The method is:
    First, wash the whole body with boiling water and soap, then apply sulfur mercury ointment. The formula is as follows: nine qian of sulfur, one qian and five fen of mercury, three liang of Vaseline (multiply this proportion if you need more). First, use a small amount of Vaseline to grind the mercury, then mix in the sulfur powder. Wash and apply every night (apply until the skin feels hot), once a day (too much application is prone to poisoning). Do not take off your underwear when sleeping at night to avoid contaminating the bedding. With this treatment method, you are guaranteed to recover in a week. (Zhang Shangde)

　　如何治疥？
    患过疥疮的人常说：“治疥不难，难于除根”。基本原因，还是治法上的问题。单纯的患疥，是不会变成脓泡的，所以成脓泡，是因为皮肤不清洁，和手指甲没有剪，经常在患疥处抓痒，使化脓菌侵入疥中成为脓泡疥。一般人的治法，只是在患处搽些药膏，而忽略了细菌是会借着虱子、手指、衣服、被褥而传满全身的，所以不能除根。根据我个人害疥与治疥的经验，不管是干疥、脓泡疥，都应该实行全面治疗，其办法是：
    先用开水和肥皂将全身洗净，后擦以硫黄水银膏，其配法如下：硫黄九钱、水银一钱五、凡士林三两（多配以此分量类推），先用少许凡士林将水银研开，后搅和硫黄末即成。每天晚上先洗后擦（擦至皮肤发热为止），一日一次（擦得多了易中毒），晚上睡觉不脱衬衣裤、以免染污被褥，这样治法，一星期保险痊愈。（张尚德）
