　　[By Our Correspondent] The military region's directly subordinate units are currently entering an upsurge of intense training. A certain regiment of the Military Region Guard Regiment is personally leading training. The training method is new. For each subject, the cadres practice first, and after they are proficient in the movements, they teach the soldiers. Every morning before reveille, each company automatically goes out to run and climb mountains. Before dawn, they practice bayonet drill and grenade throwing. After breakfast, they practice aiming and shooting. On Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, there is game time, and the whole regiment collectively practices grenade throwing, digging fortifications, or doing calisthenics. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they chop firewood for production. Political and scientific lessons are also proceeding intensely. The regiment's spring training plan was successfully completed in January, with great progress in skills. A certain leader of the military region praised it greatly. The February and March plan calls for completing all tasks in February, and then devoting most of March to stepping up production, combining production and training.

　　The Military Region Directly Subordinate Replenishment Regiment has launched an upsurge in training cadres. The regiment's original three-week crash course has completed two weeks. The average grenade throw is now over 30 meters, and everyone has learned the key points of aiming and shooting. Bayonet movements are already quite skilled and precise. The third week of training is even more intense. Some comrades get up at night to practice bayonet drill, and some disabled comrades can throw grenades 40 meters. Mutual aid groups have also put forward study plans to help comrades who are weaker. Revolutionary competitions have been launched between squads and platoons. In addition to continuing to practice the three major skills this week, the focus will be on night village attacks. In extracurricular time, they learn earthwork operations, exercise marching ability, and practice night movements.

　　The replenishment regiment newly formed by the Military and Political University cadres began intensive training on the 12th and visited the Directly Subordinate Replenishment Regiment on the 18th to understand the training situation and exchange experiences to quickly improve their skills.

　　军区警卫团紧张练兵
    技术上有极大进步
    补充团掀起训练干部热潮
    【本报特讯】军区直属部队刻正进入紧张练兵热潮中。军区警卫团某团又亲自领导练兵、训练方法是新的课目，先由干部操练，动作熟练后再教战士。每晨起床号前，各连均自动带出，跑步爬山。天色微明，即苦练刺枪与投弹，早餐后练瞄准射击。每星期一、三、五、六四天游戏时间，全团集体练习投弹挖工事或作器械操。星期二、四两日砍柴生产，政治课及科学课亦在紧张进行中。该团春季练兵计划，一月份已胜利完成，技术上有极大进步，军区某首长曾备加赞扬。二、三月份计划决定在二月份全部完成，三月份则抽出大部时间加紧生产，将生产与练兵结合起来。
    军区直属补充团，已展开了训练干部的热潮。该团原定三周的突击教育，已完成二周。投弹平均在三十公尺以上，都学会了瞄准要领及射击要诀，刺杀动作已相当熟练、确实。第三周的训练更加紧张，有的同志夜间起来练习刺杀，有的残废同志投弹距离到四十公尺。互助组也都提出了学习计划，以帮助较差的同志。区队与区队，班与班发起了革命竞赛。这一周除了继续练习三大技术外，并着重夜间村落攻击。在课外时间来学习土工作业，锻炼行军力及夜间动作。
    军政大学干部新组成的补充团，于十二日开始紧张训练，并于十八日到直属补充团参观，了解训练状况，交谈经验，以迅速提高技术。（王文治）
