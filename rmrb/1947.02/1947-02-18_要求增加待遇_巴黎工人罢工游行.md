Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: A compilation of Paris news reports: At 4 PM on the 14th, Paris workers went on strike and staged a demonstration march to protest the government's wage policies. From 4 PM to 8 PM that day, automatic telephone connections between Paris and other provinces were cut off. Agence France-Presse stated that this was the first time in Paris's history. As a result of the strike, no newspapers were published in Paris from the afternoon of the 13th to the evening of the 14th. According to a Reuters dispatch, the strike began at 9 AM on the morning of the 11th, initiated by the city's newspaper staff (excluding reporters and printers) demanding wage increases. Participants included truck drivers, clerks, typists, telephone operators, and odd-job workers. Because Ramadier refused the workers' demand for a 25% wage increase, the strike expanded to include typesetters. Employees of state-owned tobacco and match factories, post offices, and other public utilities in Paris (including the police) had all joined the strike wave by the 14th.
