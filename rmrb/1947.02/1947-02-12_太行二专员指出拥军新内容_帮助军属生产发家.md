    Taihang Second Commissioner Points Out New Content in Supporting the Army
    Help Military Families Produce and Prosper
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Commissioner Fan of the Taihang Second Administrative Office pointed out at the county magistrate joint meeting regarding army support work that future focus should be on establishing military families' livelihoods. He first stated that after realizing "land to the tiller," the old view and practice of ensuring military families do not go hungry should today be further developed to help military families and veterans to turn themselves around, produce, and prosper, universally reaching the living standards of middle peasants. We must start from two aspects: 1. Inspect the turn-around: We must pay special attention to the degree to which military families have turned around and the size of any deficits, quickly filling them to ensure they are thoroughly turned around. 2. Comprehensively help them engage in production and establish their livelihoods: (1) Substitute farming and independent farming: Provide substitute farming for those without labor, and organize those with labor for independent farming. (2) Substitute side occupations and independent side occupations: Organize military families and veterans to engage in side-occupation production, doing whatever they can, developing family handicrafts such as spinning thread, etc. To solve the problem of labor shortage, the Yushi experience is to combine substitute farming with "substitute side occupations," and to mobilize and organize the investment of military families' turn-around capital into cooperatives, distributing a certain amount of extra dividends to them through the mass line. In some places, the masses pool shares into cooperatives, topping up and distributing dividends to poor military families.

    太行二专员指出拥军新内容
    帮助军属生产发家
    【本报讯】太行二专署樊专员在县长联席会上关于拥军工作指出今后应着重建立军属家务。他首称在实现耕者有其田后，保证军属不饿肚子的旧观点旧做法今天应进一步帮助军属荣誉军人翻身生产发家，普遍达到中农生活水平。要从两方面着手：一、检查翻身，要特别注意军属的翻身程度，窟窿大小，迅速填补起来，使他们彻底翻身。二、全面的帮助他们进行生产、建立家务，１、代耕自耕，无劳力者给代耕，有劳力者组织自耕。２、代副自副，组织军属荣退军人稿副业生产，没啥干啥，能啥干啥，发展家庭手工纺线业等。解决劳力缺乏问题，榆社经验是把代耕与“代副”结合起来，把军属得到的翻身资本，动员与组织投入到合作社，经过群众路线，给他们多分一定的红利。有的地方群众集股入合作社、给贫苦军属顶股分红。
