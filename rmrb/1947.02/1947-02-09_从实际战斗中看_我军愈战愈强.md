    Seeing From Actual Combat:
    Our Army Grows Stronger With Each Battle
    [This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, February 7th] The People's Liberation Army grows stronger with each battle, its combat effectiveness and technology improving daily, as can be seen in actual combat.
    During the recapture of Dingtao, one unit took only five minutes to break into a heavily fortified castle the enemy had spent four and a half months building, and completely resolved the battle in fifty minutes, achieving a high level of success in the assault battle with our troops combining command, technology, and courage. After Dingtao City was occupied by the Chiang army in August of last year, the masses within 30 li of the city were forced to build bunkers and enclosed villages for four and a half months, constructing two rows of caltrops, a wooden city wall, and two rows of outer trenches. The outer trenches were laid with landmines, and the battlements had rolling logs, bricks, hand grenades, and lime powder, specifically for dealing with attacking troops. The four gates of the city and the crossroads on both sides of the streets had bunkers, pillboxes, and wire obstacles, while the stockade walls had dense machine gun and mortar positions. On the 23rd at night, a unit of the Eighth Route Army quickly surrounded the enemy in the freezing cold. At 4:20 PM on the 24th, one unit first removed all obstacles in its path, and then launched an attack. The 9th Company of one unit broke through the enemy's fortifications in five minutes, stormed into the city, and immediately pounced towards the west. At the same time, our army on the west side also broke into the west gate and advanced eastward. The two armies then met in the center of the city. The enemy was forced to shrink into the northwest corner of the city, fragmented and in disarray, attempting to escape by jumping over the city walls. However, a unit of our army had long ago spread a net outside the gates. After the enemy entered the net, it was tightened layer by layer, and the enemy laid down their weapons. Shi Fuqi, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet security captain, was killed while fleeing. Pang Shaoxu, the deputy head of the 428th regiment of the 68th Division, and his battalion commander changed into plain clothes and mingled with hundreds of "Homecoming Corps" members, attempting to escape, but they were also captured. Thus, the Dingtao assault battle ended with the swift, thorough, and decisive annihilation of the enemy and a complete victory.
    After Chiang Kai-shek occupied Cao County City in September of last year, he often garrisoned it with a brigade, constantly reinforcing the city walls and bunkers day and night. Since the successive liberation of cities such as Juye, Jiaxiang, Chengwu, and Dingtao, the Chiang army entrenched in the city became even more frightened, maintaining martial law day and night, and forcibly demolishing houses outside the four gates, leaving more than a thousand refugee families homeless in the freezing weather. The Chiang army believed that such a high city with wide moats could guarantee safety, but unexpectedly, the Eighth Route Army conquered the city in one day and one night. At the beginning of the attack, the Eighth Route Army's heroic artillery fired the first shell, setting the east gate tower ablaze, suppressing all the Chiang army's firepower. The main attacking force climbed the city walls in a quarter of an hour. The Chiang army fell into chaos, abandoning their weapons and fleeing into civilian houses to change into civilian clothes, attempting to escape. The residents rose up to assist the Eighth Route Army in capturing them. In addition to killing and wounding more than 500 people, Wang Baode, the deputy commander of the Chiang Kai-shek Shandong 11th Special District Security Brigade, and more than 1,500 others were captured, with no one escaping.

### 从实际战斗中看  我军愈战愈强

    从实际战斗中看
    我军愈战愈强
    【本报冀鲁豫前线七日电】人民解放军愈战愈强，战斗力与技术日益提高，可于实际战斗中见之。
    在收复定陶时，某部以五分钟时间攻入敌人修筑四个半月之坚固城堡，五十分钟内全部解决战斗，取得攻坚战斗中我部队以指挥、技术、勇猛相结合之高度成就。定陶城于去年八月为蒋军侵占后，即强迫城周围卅里地以内之群众修筑碉堡围寨，前后达四个半月，修成两道鹿砦，一道木城，两道外壕，外壕上敷设地雷，城垛上有滚木、砖头、手榴弹、石灰粉，专为对付攻城部队；城四关及街道两侧十字街口，均有碉堡及地堡垒、铁丝障碍等，砦墙上有密集的机枪及迫击炮阵地。二十三日夜八路军某部在冰雪严寒中迅速将敌包围，二十四日午后四点二十分，某部首先拔除前进路上一切障碍，继即发起冲锋。某部九连以五分钟时间突破敌人坚固工事，攻入城内，随即向西猛扑，同时西路我军亦突入西门，向东发展，两路大军遂于城中心会师，敌人被迫缩至城西北一隅，支离破碎，立呈紊乱状态，企图跳城墙逃窜，但我某部早在关外撒下天罗地网，待其入网后，即层层紧缩包围，敌人遂全部放下武器。蒋记伪保安大队长石福起于逃窜中被击毙，六十八师四二八团副团长庞绍绪及其营长则换上便衣，杂入数百“还乡团”团员内，企图潜逃，但亦被俘。定陶攻坚战于是以迅速彻底干脆的消灭敌人，而全部胜利结束。
    曹县城于去年九月蒋介石侵占后，经常以一个旅困守，日夜加修城墙碉堡。自钜野、嘉祥、城武、定陶等城相继光复后，盘踞该城之蒋军更惊恐万状，日夜戒严，并强拆四关民房，使一千余户难民在冰天雪地中无家可归。蒋军以为如此高城宽壕可保无虞，不料一天一夜八路军即将该城一举攻克。攻城开始时，八路军神勇炮兵第一个炮弹就使东门炮楼燃起熊熊大火，蒋军火力全被压倒，主攻部队一刻钟后即行登城。蒋军乱成一团，纷纷丢弃武器，钻进民房换去军衣，企图逃脱，居民奋起协助八路军加以捕捉，除毙伤五百余人外，蒋记山东十一专区保安旅副司令王宝德以下一千五百余名，悉被俘获，无一漏网。
