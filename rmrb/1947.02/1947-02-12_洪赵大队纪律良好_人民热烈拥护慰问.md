    【Report from the Taiyue Front by this newspaper on the 5th】 The Huo County government and representatives of the masses, carrying over 130,000 Jicha banknotes, 34 silver dollars, 170,000 in legal tender, as well as towels, soap, cigarettes, etc., rushed to the front line overnight to comfort the commanders and fighters of the Hong Zhao Brigade. Since entering the Eighteenth Military Subdistrict, the Hong Zhao Brigade has strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and the mass discipline is extremely good. During the war, they conducted discipline reflection every day, and reflected even after a day of marching. Upon arriving at a village, the troops only entered the houses after the masses had cleared them out. The next morning, they first bundled up the straw bedding and put it back where it was, cleaned up, washed the pots and bowls, and then asked the villagers to check for any losses. Only after the villagers confirmed that everything was correct would the troops assemble and depart. Once, the directly subordinate team failed to clean the courtyard for the masses before leaving, and the captain personally supervised the cleaning. Chang Xinhong, a soldier from the twelfth squad of the first company of the second squadron, was a newly liberated soldier who quickly reformed his thinking. He accidentally broke a villager's small bowl in a village, and wanted to compensate the person but didn't have any money. In the end, he had no choice but to give his new cotton shoes to the person as compensation and apologize. The Hong Zhao Brigade also widely carried out propaganda work, taking advantage of lulls in the fighting to convene local mass meetings, publicizing the victory of the People's Liberation Army and our policy of self-defense.

    洪赵大队纪律良好
    人民热烈拥护慰问
    【本报太岳前线五日电】霍县县政府与群众代表，携带冀钞十三万余元，银元三十四元，法币十七万及毛巾、肥皂、纸烟等，星夜赶到前线慰劳洪赵大队指战员。洪赵大队自进入十八分区后，严格执行三大纪律八项注意，群众纪律极好。在战争中每天进行纪律反省，一天行军后也要反省，到村直待群众把房子腾出来后部队才进入房舍，次晨首先把铺草捆好搬放原处打扫干净，锅碗洗净，然后请老乡检查一次有无损失，直到老乡认为没错，部队才集合出发。有次直属队临行未给群众打扫院子，队长亲自督促打扫，二中队一连十二班战士常新鸿，是一刚解放过来的战士，思想改造很快，在某村打了群众一个盏子，有心赔偿人家可是又没有钱，最后没有办法将发给他的新棉鞋赔给人家并道歉。洪赵大队还普遍进行宣传工作，利用战争空隙，召开当地群众会议，宣传人民解放军的胜利，和我们的自卫政策。
