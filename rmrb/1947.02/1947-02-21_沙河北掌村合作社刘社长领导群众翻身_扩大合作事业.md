　　Chairman Liu of the Cooperative in Beizhang Village, Shahe, Leads the Masses in Turning Over a New Leaf, Expanding Cooperative Undertakings

　　[This Dispatch from Shahe] The masses in Beizhang Village, Shahe, have turned over a new leaf. During the movement, Chairman Liu of the village cooperative actively led the masses and persuaded them to invest their distributed fruits or accumulated materials in the cooperative to develop production. All men and women in the village became members of the cooperative, and the shares have increased to more than 3.39 million yuan, with the credit cooperative reaching 858,000 yuan. In the past three months, it has established businesses such as a coal factory, ash burning kiln, restaurant, dyeing workshop, flower workshop, oil mill, vinegar workshop, firecracker factory, and pharmacy. The village cooperative was founded in February of last year and underwent a tortuous development process: At that time, the village had only recently been liberated, and the villagers, having been deceived by the Japanese invaders' cooperatives, were unreceptive when Chairman Liu came to the village to mobilize shareholding. It took more than forty days and twenty mobilization meetings to convince the masses and some of the cadres. Only 20,000 yuan in shares were collected from the cadres. Later, Lao Wang, the cooperative hero of the village, called for the establishment of a brick kiln, and the cadres finally understood and actively bought shares. They then went to mobilize women weavers, military dependents, and others. The women weavers invested 25,000 yuan, and the military dependents invested 15,500 yuan, totaling 76,200 yuan. With a loan of 50,000 yuan from the Jinnan Branch of the Bank, the ash burning kiln was finally established, and the Farmers' Association selected Han Suo as the manager of the ash kiln. At that time, the total funds were only enough to burn two small ash kilns, but the Dazhong Coal Mine needed ash to build houses. Han signed an agreement with the factory to exchange coal, with the coal factory first providing the kiln with two thousand baskets of coal slag, and the ash being delivered after it was burned, thus establishing seven ash kilns. The coal factory lacked people to transport the coal chunks, so Comrade Liu Shiping, the chairman of the cooperative, patiently persuaded the cart drivers with livestock to transport the coal, guaranteeing them regular work and income. This solved the transportation problem. The Farmers' Association also formed five ash burning teams, increasing the number of ash kilns to thirteen. In May of last year, the cooperative earned 1.07 million yuan, and the Farmers' Association's fifth team earned 390,000 yuan. The Dazhong Coal Mine also gave the cooperative a bonus of 10,000 yuan to help it develop. The total profit from these three items was 1.47 million yuan. After deducting 150,000 yuan for public welfare funds, each yuan of share capital could be distributed with a dividend of seven yuan. During the distribution of dividends, bad elements spread rumors, and the masses who had not bought shares blamed the cadres for not calling on them to buy shares universally at the time; the masses who were able to receive dividends withdrew all their principal and interest. Only 25,000 yuan in cadre shares remained. In September, Comrade Guo Wanying from the Shahe Branch of the Jinnan Bank came to the village to help Chairman Liu develop the cooperative, believing that expanding the cooperative's business should be combined with the ongoing turn-over movement in the village. Comrades Guo and Liu both actively led the masses' turn-over movement and explained the benefits of the cooperative to the masses. The masses then realized their past mistake of withdrawing their share capital. All men and women in the village successively invested part of their distributed fruits in shares, and a credit cooperative was established. The cooperative and the credit cooperative have truly become mass-based and are developing vigorously. (Zhao Guoying)

　　沙河北掌村合作社刘社长领导群众翻身
    扩大合作事业
    【本报沙河讯】沙河北掌村群众翻了身。该村合作社刘社长在运动中，积极领导群众，并劝说群众将分得果实或积存物资投资该社，以发展生产。全村男女都成了该社社员，股金已增为三百三十九万余元，信用社为八十五万八千余元。三个月来，已创办了煤厂、烧灰窑、饭店、染坊、花坊、油坊、醋坊、鞭炮厂、药铺等业务。该村合作社是去年二月创办的，曾经过一段曲折的发展过程：当时该村解放不久，老乡因受过日寇合作社欺骗，刘社长到该村动员入股时，群众和一部分干部思想都没有打通。费了四十多天工夫，开了二十次动员会，只收到干部股款二万元。后来该村合作英雄老王几号召集股办砖窑，干部们才想通了，纷纷入股。他们又去动员纺妇、军属等。纺妇入股二万五千元，军属入股一万五千五百元，共集股七万六千二百元。又在冀南分行贷款五万元，烧灰窑才办了起来，农会选韩锁当灰窑经理。当时全部资金只够烧两个小灰窑，恰好大众煤矿需用灰盖房。韩和该厂签订换煤办法，煤厂先给该窑二千筐煤渣块，灰烧好再送灰，这样就开办了七个灰窑。煤厂的煤块没脚户运，合作社长刘世平同志耐心地说服了有牲口的脚户运煤，保证脚户经常有活干、有钱赚。这样才解决了运输问题。农会又组成五个烧灰窑，灰窑增为十三个。去年五月，该社赚洋一百零七万元，农会五组赚洋三十九万元。大众煤矿又给合作社奖金一万元，帮助该社发展。以上三项共赚一百四十七万元。除出公益基金十五万元，群众每元股金能分七元红利。分红时，有坏分子造谣，没有入股的群众怪干部当时不叫他们普遍入股；能分红的群众又将本利全部取走。只剩下干部股金二万五千元。九月间，冀南银行沙河分行国万英同志来该村，帮助刘社长发展合作社，认为扩充合作社业务，应与该村正在开始的翻身运动结合。国、刘两同志都积极地领导了群众翻身运动，并给群众讲合作社对群众的利益。群众才发现自己过去退股本的错误。全村男女都纷纷将分得果实一部入股，并成立了信用社。合作社与信用社才真正变为群众性的，蓬勃地发展起来。（赵国英）
