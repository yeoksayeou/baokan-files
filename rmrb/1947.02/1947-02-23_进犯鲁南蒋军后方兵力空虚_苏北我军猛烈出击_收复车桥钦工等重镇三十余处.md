　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st -- While Chiang's army is attacking southern Shandong, the soldiers and civilians in the Yancheng and Huaihai areas of northern Jiangsu have been actively fighting the enemy in the rear, where forces are extremely weak. In the 24 days from January 21st to February 13th, they killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,280 Chiang soldiers and "Homecoming Legions," seized more than 480 machine guns and rifles, and recovered more than 30 important market towns. This accumulation of small victories into a larger one further shook the rear of the enemy invading southern Shandong. Among the recovered towns include more than ten places in the triangle area of Funing, Lianshui, and Huai'an, such as Donggou, Yanggu Village, Cheqiao, Qinggong, Machang, and Shitang; six places on the south side of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway between Donghai, Shuyang, and Lianshui, such as Pingmin Mountain, Fangshan, East and West Xuebu; and nineteen market towns west of the Grand Canal and east of Hongze Lake, such as Chahe Town, Shuanggou, Renheji, and Linmatou. This has forced the Chiang army to retreat to a small number of strongholds along the highway, the Grand Canal, and the Yancheng Canal. The Chiang army occupying Shuyang City has tightly closed all four gates, leaving only a small south gate for entry and exit, and has built fortifications throughout the streets, fearing an attack by the New Fourth Army. Chiang's "Homecoming Legions" and "Self-Defense Forces" in various places have fled back to the liberated areas.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th -- Chiang soldiers besieged in various strongholds in central and northern Jiangsu are deserting in large numbers to the New Fourth Army. Approximately one regiment of the remnants of the 49th Division of the Chiang army, entrenched along the Jiangyan, Qutang, and Hai'an line in central Jiangsu, has seen more than 200 desertions in the past ten days, of which more than 120 have voluntarily surrendered to the New Fourth Army. More than 800 conscripts newly drafted from Anhui to replenish the 187th Brigade of the 68th Division deserted more than 200 on the way from Taixian Qutang to Dongtai, a distance of more than 100 li. After the Chiang army in Shenyan, north of Dongtai, was annihilated earlier this month, three to five soldiers from the 21st Division of the Chiang army in nearby Dazhongji had twelve men surrender to the New Fourth Army. On the night of the 7th, six Chiang soldiers from Rugao also deserted to the New Fourth Army, claiming that war-weariness and homesickness had permeated the entire army. Soldiers of the 44th and 83rd Divisions of the Chiang army occupying Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, are also fleeing to the liberated areas outside the city in large numbers. By the beginning of this month, the democratic governments in the suburban areas of the city had already accommodated more than 300 deserters from the Chiang army.
