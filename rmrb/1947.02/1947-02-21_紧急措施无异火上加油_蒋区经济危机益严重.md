Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. Comprehensive news from Reuters, Associated Press, and United Press International from Nanjing and Shanghai on the 17th and 18th indicate that the basic situation of the crisis has not changed at all since Chiang Kai-shek's economic emergency measures were implemented on the 16th. Only salary and wage earners, ordinary citizens, and exporters have been severely affected. An economic figure in Shanghai told an Associated Press reporter: "The government is clearly trying to lure the US$500 million loan and attempting to show at home and abroad that it has taken appropriate measures." A stockbroker pointed out: "The basic economic situation has not been resolved." A major foreign businessman told a Reuters reporter: "The irredeemable budget deficit and the issue of banknotes are the real roots of the current difficulties." Therefore, the keynote of Shanghai's reaction to the new measures is pessimistic.

The Associated Press stated: Less than 24 hours after Chiang Kai-shek announced his "last line of defense" plan to deal with the crisis, operators in the black market for US dollars and gold went "underground." An importer told reporters: "There is already an underground black market. However, operators are careful, and they will only deal with you if they know you can be trusted. In the black market, the price of US dollars has exceeded the official price to 13,000 yuan. There is no definite price for the gold black market yet, but it is expected that when the black market determines the gold price, it will be much higher than the official price." An importer pointed out: "The new exchange rate may temporarily slightly lower the price of banknotes, but just like the adjustment of the exchange rate in August last year, the black market will rise again soon. In addition to the black market, the outflow of domestic funds is expected to become more serious." In the open market, the Chiang government announced a purchase price of 12,000 yuan for US dollars, but after deducting the 3% handling fee, the actual price is 11,600 yuan; while previous buyers paid a purchase price of 18,000 to 20,000 yuan. The official gold price is set at 480,000 yuan, but previous buyers have already paid more than 900,000 yuan. From the 17th, a line of people holding small amounts of US dollars went to the Central Bank to exchange them, but the amount collected by the Central Bank by the 18th was only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. No one sold gold to the Central Bank all day on the 17th. Chiang government's forced low-price purchase of gold and banknotes only caused great losses to small and medium-sized citizens who had previously purchased gold and banknotes. Moreover, because Chiang Kai-shek ordered all secret agents to go out and search, secret agents have already stopped cars and passengers. Citizens are deeply afraid that they will search their homes and institutions and be subjected to endless harassment.

The new measures have had a particularly severe impact on salaried workers. According to United Press International, millions of people in Shanghai who rely on salaries to make a living have expressed serious anxiety about their future livelihoods. The law stipulates that salaries should not exceed the price index in January, but there are currently no signs of price declines, so the actual income of salary earners has decreased by at least 40% (while prices have increased by at least 80%). At the same time, according to the law, public services such as transportation, water, and electricity have greatly increased. The income of salaried workers is now lower than ever.

The official exchange rate (12,000 yuan) is far lower than the price level, which is also very unfavorable to exporters. According to Reuters, Shanghai exporters said that most export goods are showing signs of sharp increases, which will make the cost of export goods higher than the market price in countries such as the United States, and exporters will suffer losses or be unable to sell their goods.

### 紧急措施无异火上加油  蒋区经济危机益严重

　　紧急措施无异火上加油
    蒋区经济危机益严重
    【新华社延安十九日电】综合十七、十八日路透、合众及美联社京沪电讯消息，蒋介石十六日的经济紧急措施实行后，危机的基本情况丝毫未改，唯薪水工资收入者一般市民及出口商人惨受打击。上海一位经济界人士对美联社记者称：“政府显然是在勾引美国的五亿元借款、企图向国内外表示它已采取适当措施。”又据一位股票经纪人指出：“基本的经济情况未曾解决。”一位主要外商发言人对路透社记者说：“无可弥补的预算亏空及钞票发行的问题，才是目前困难的真根源。”因此，上海对新措施反应的基调是悲观。
    美联社称：蒋介石宣布其对付危机的“最后防线”方案后未出二十四小时，美钞黄金黑市的经营者即转入“地下”。一位进口商告记者：“已有了地下黑市。但是，经营者小心翼翼，他们明知你可信任，他才会同你交易。黑市中，美钞价格已越出官价而为一万三千元，黄金黑市尚未出现确定价格，但预料黑市确定金价时，将比官价高得多。某进口商指出：新汇率或能使钞价暂时稍稍降低，但正如去年八月调整汇率的情形，不久黑市又要上升。除黑市外，国内资金的外逃现象预计将更为严重。在公开市场中，蒋政府宣布美钞收价为一万二千元，除百分之三的手续费，实际得一万一千六百元；而前此购钞者则付了一万八千到两万元的购价。黄金官价定为四十八万，但原先购买者已付了九十万元以上的价钱。十七日起，中央银行门前有一列持有美金很少量的人前往掉换，但中央银行收额截至十八日不过三四十万元，十七日整日没有人向中央银行售买黄金，蒋政府强迫低价收进金钞。只是使中小市民原先购买金钞者大受损失。且因蒋介石命令全体特务出动搜查，已有特务拦阻汽车及乘客，市民深恐他们要搜查住房及机关，而受到无限苛扰。
    新措施对于薪金收入者打击尤大。据合众社称：沪市数百万依靠薪资糊口者，对他们未来的生计表示严重的焦虑。法令规定薪资不得超起一月份物价指数，但目前物价均无跌落之迹象，因此薪资收入的实际所得已至少降低百分之四十（物价则已至少涨了百分之八十）。同时，按照法令，公警事业如乘车费、水电费等均大为增加。现在薪资收入者所得比任何时候均为低微。
    官定汇率（一万二千元）远较物价水平为低，使出口商人亦蒙很大不利。据路透社引上海出口商称：大部分出口货物呈猛涨迹象，此将使出口货成本在美国等国家高出市价，出口商将蒙受损失或不能售出货物。
