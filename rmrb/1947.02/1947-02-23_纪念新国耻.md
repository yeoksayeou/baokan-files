　　Commemorating the New National Humiliation

　　Chiang Kai-shek is single-mindedly anti-people and determined to sell all of China to his American father. He signed many traitorous treaties with the United States. On November 4, 1946, he signed another "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," selling everything in China, from the sky to the ground, completely. This is even more harmful than the Twenty-One Demands that Yuan Shikai signed with Japan, which brought national humiliation. For example, American planes can fly freely in Chinese skies, American ships can navigate freely on Chinese waters, and Americans can not only own property, buy land, open mines, and run factories in China, doing whatever they want, but the Chiang government must also be responsible for protecting and helping them to exploit and oppress the Chinese people.

　　Such a large-scale act of national betrayal by Chiang Kai-shek surpasses any previous traitor or top-level collaborator. At the same time, it shows that the ambition of American imperialism to invade China is greater than that of any previous imperialism—even the Japanese devils.

　　All Chinese people resolutely oppose this traitorous treaty, and our border region people are even more actively taking the lead. November 4th is our new day of commemoration of national humiliation. Everyone must wash away this national humiliation and strive to abolish the traitorous treaty. We will never stop until we achieve our goal.

　　纪念新国耻
    蒋介石一心反人民，决意要把全中国卖给他美国爸爸，和美国订了很多卖国条约，在三十五年十一月四日，又订了一个“中美商约”，把中国所有东西，从天上到地下，统统卖个干净。比较袁世凯和日本订的二十一条丧权辱国还利害，例如美国飞机在中国天空可以随便飞行，美国船只在中国的水面可以随便航驶，美国人不仅可以在中国置业买地、开矿山、办工厂，想干什么就干什么，而且蒋政府还得负责保护，帮助他们来剥削压迫中国人。
    像蒋介石这样的大卖国，过去无论那个卖国贼汉奸头子都赶不上，同时也说明美国帝国主义侵略中国的野心，比过去那个帝国主义——甚至日本鬼子还要大得多。
    全中国人民坚决反对这个卖国条约，我们边区人民更是积极当先。十一月四日这天，是我们新的国耻纪念日，大家定要洗刷这个国耻，为废除卖国条约来努力，不达目的，决不停止。
