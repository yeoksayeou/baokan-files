    The Warriors in the Battle of Yangzhuang
    Fang De

    In the Battle of Yangzhuang, north of Yutai City, there were such heroic warriors who completed the task of annihilating the invading troops of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line equipped with Japanese weaponry. This is not a legendary tale, but an epic from the patriotic self-defense war.

    (I) "If the enemy doesn't surrender, annihilate them!"

    "If the enemy doesn't surrender, annihilate them!" The soldiers were very familiar with this order.

    Liu Zhuxi, holding his gun, rushed to the front of the first courtyard. An officer, resisting with a Mauser pistol, fired a dud shot at Zhuxi's head. He then frantically pulled out an American spring-loaded grenade, but before he could pull the pin, he threw it at Zhuxi's face. Zhuxi's left eyeball was blasted out of its socket, but Zhuxi didn't even touch it. Instead, he fiercely pounced forward. The fellow who was about to run away was stabbed to death before he could take a step. Zhuxi seized the pistol and continued the new battle.

    (II) The gun is exchanged for blood; never discard it, even in death.

    The enemy blockading a house at the far east end lay motionless on the ground like dead dogs, while those with minor injuries were still crying out, "Eighth Route Army officer! Finish me off with a shot!"

    "Don't shout, the medic will come to take care of you later!" Han Sanmao was comforting a wounded soldier when the enemy counterattacked from three sides. Grenades exploded on the roof, creating holes, and landed on the ground, blasting craters. Four of the seven comrades were sacrificed, and Li Xiusheng, with a minor injury, lay motionless in the corner of the room.

    "We can advance an inch but not retreat a step; we cannot lose these wounded. Old Hu, watch and fire from the south corner of the wall; I'll watch and fire from the north corner of the wall!"

    Hu Huzhi, whose left eye was half shot away, aimed and fired with his right eye. Han Sanmao, wounded in the leg, still said, "Old Hu! It's okay, shoot!"

    The enemy's grenades became more and more fierce, eventually setting the house on fire. The flames burned Sanmao's pants and singed Huzhi's eyebrows. When the grenades were used up and the bullets were gone, they could no longer move. Sanmao said to Old Hu, "Quickly hide the gun under the enemy's corpse, crawl over here, we'll die facing each other!"

    The enemy had not heard Sanmao and Old Hu's gunfire for a long time, so they cautiously poked half a head into the house and looked around. It was quiet.

    The comrades who counterattacked followed the deafening sound of the engineers' explosion and rushed into the eastern room that had been occupied by the enemy. The two martyrs who were head to head were resurrected. Faint whispers could still be distinguished: "Comrades, my gun is still under the dead dog!"

    Li Xiusheng also crawled out of the pile of corpses, carrying two rifles around his neck and a Mauser pistol stuck in his lower back. Although he had only been liberated by the Eighth Route Army in the Juan'nan campaign, he already fully understood, "The gun is exchanged for blood; never discard it, even in death!"

    (III) Heroic Medic

    "Hey! Your jaw is shot off, quickly go find the medical officer!" The instructor said with concern, looking at a young soldier who was charging towards the enemy's position with his gun.

    The soldier didn't say a word, but rescued his comrades. The instructor became anxious and repeated his order, heavily emphasizing that he come back.

    The wounded soldier answered with difficulty, "I am the medical officer Zhang Yongchang!…"

    天明, the company commander took a Type 38 rifle with a bayonet from the enemy's corpse and gave it to the young medic Zhang Fenglin, instructing him and five others to defend a house and resist the enemy's counterattack from a dozen meters away to the south.

    The enemy's grenades and small shells made the courtyard a chaotic, dark place, and they also bluffed, "Surrender your guns now!" Zhang Fenglin crawled under the loophole he was guarding, not moving at all, cursing in his heart, "Surrender our guns? Hmph! Come and get them if you have the guts! We'll take your guns later!" As soon as the enemy showed their heads, he shot them back.

    The enemy's counterattack was repelled, and the wounded soldiers crowded into his location. The medical supplies were used up. Some comrades went to tear the enemy's blankets into bandages, some rolled cloth strips, some pulled cotton, and some carried the wounded. Little Fenglin was in charge of bandaging. This tense first-aid station was set up during the intervals between repelling the enemy's counterattacks.

    During the counterattack, Little Fenglin carried grenades and charged into the enemy's position south of the road to annihilate the enemy.

    (IV) The Counterattack of Eleven People

    When the enemy was too weak to counterattack, we organized a counterattack of eleven people, which was like a hot knife through butter, taking down the independent courtyard south of the road in one fell swoop.

    Small artilleryman Yang Changsuo also carried a rifle and went in with reconnaissance man Fu Zhanming, killing and wounding the enemy. The living enemies crawled under the peasants' beds, begging for mercy…

    People dragged this group of prisoners out from under the beds, but Yang Changsuo went into the peasants' kitchen to search. A straw hat was trembling on a pile of firewood. He lifted it up and saw an enemy with a peaked cap squatting underneath.

    "Where's the gun!?"

    "No—no! Officer!"

    "No, you dog, I'll kill you!"

    "I'm a small artilleryman, the cannon is here!"

    When Changsuo took the small cannon, the prisoner said again, "Spare me! I'll give you this gold…"

    "We don't want the prisoners' things. It's cold, give you this cloth hat to wear! Don't worry, come with me, the Eighth Route Army doesn't kill prisoners!"

    (V) "Little Devil! You're back!"

    When Yue Longzhi crawled from the south into the completely destroyed west room, the enemy was still using machine guns to block the doorway. He crawled under the corpse at the doorway and quietly monitored the enemy.

    As soon as the enemy machine gunner showed his head, Little Yue's bullet flew over. After fighting for a long time, the enemy shooter could not find where the bullet was coming from. In the end, he dared not stick his head out again. The heads of people showing from the window in the north room were all wearing Eighth Route Army hats. Little Yue's heart was about to explode with joy! He jumped to the base of the north room wall and only then did he realize the machine-gun hole was too small. He quickly unloaded the things on his body before crawling in.

    Together with Company Commander Wu Yongfu, he became even braver. He fought fiercely until reinforcements arrived, and his heart finally fell to the ground with a thud.

    When he returned victoriously and threw himself in front of Company Commander Zhao Chuntang, the company commander squeezed his small hand and said, "Little devil, you're back!"

    Someone deliberately asked him: "Little devil, did the enemy confiscate your gun?"

    He replied proudly: "I confiscate the enemy's guns all day long, how could I let the enemy confiscate my gun?!"

    (VI) When Victory Comes

    Telephonist Cui Yubao sat on the ground with his legs curled up, his hands crossed, holding his knees, placing his head that he could not lift on them, with his gun slung in his arms and the telephone beside him.

    When a high-ranking commander who inspected the front line went to comfort him, he simply did not have the energy to lift his head. But, he had won, and he said excitedly, "Chief! The deputy regimental commander told us to learn from the hundred heroes of Zhangfengji; we repelled the enemy's seven counterattacks, and the loophole I guarded, the dog, never got it. Later, I also participated in the counterattack of eleven people, and I rushed up with grenades. The American 60 small cannons, the Japanese "crooked-neck" machine guns, Type 38 rifles, people, were all cleaned up…"

    杨庄战斗中的勇士们
    方德
    在鱼台城北杨庄之战中，有这样英勇的战士们，完成了消灭蒋家日械嫡系进犯军的任务。这不是传奇的故事，而是爱国自卫战争中的一段史诗。
    （一）“敌人不投降，就消灭它！”
    “敌人不投降，就消灭它！”战士们已很熟习这个命令了。
    刘珠喜端着枪冲到最前面一所院里，一个提驳壳枪顽抗的军官照准珠喜劈头一枪打了个瞎火，又仓惶掏出带弹簧的美国手榴弹，来不及拔掉保险针就迎面掷来，珠喜左眼珠被打的冒出眼眶子外面，珠喜没有摸一摸就狠命扑上去，那个拔腿要跑的家伙还没迈出步就被一刀刺死，珠喜夺过手枪又进行新的战斗。
    （二）枪是血换来的，死也不丢掉。
    堵截在尽东头一间房子里的敌人，打死的像死狗爬在地上动也不动，带花的还在叫唤：“八路军官长！补我一枪！”
    “不要叫，等会儿卫生员来了给你收拾！”韩三卯正在安慰敌人遗弃的彩号，敌人却又从三面反扑过来。手榴弹落在房上炸个洞，掉在地上崩个坑，七个同志就牺牲了四个，带重彩的李秀升躺在屋角里不能动。
    “我们进一尺不能退一寸，不能丢掉这些彩号。老胡你在南边墙角瞟住打，我在北边墙脚瞟着打！”
    胡虎之的左眼打掉了半个，就右眼瞄准射击。腿上带彩的韩三卯还说：“老胡！不要紧，打！”
    敌人的手榴弹越来越猛，最后把房子打着，火花烧着三卯的裤子，燎光虎之的眉毛，手榴弹扔完，子弹打光。最后他们也打得不能动了，三卯向老胡说：“赶快把枪藏在敌人死尸下面，爬过来，我们死要死个头对头！”
    敌人好久没有听到三卯和老胡还击的枪声，蹑脚蹑手探了半个脑袋钻进屋子里看了看，静静的。
    反攻的同志们接着工兵爆炸的巨响又冲进被敌人占领的东房，两个头对头的烈士复活了，细微的呓语还可以分辨得出：“同志们，我的枪还在死狗下面！”
    李秀升也从死尸堆里爬出来，脖子上挂了两支步枪，后腰上还插了一支盒子。他虽是鄄南战役中才被八路军解放的，却已经完全懂得“枪，是血换来的，死也不能丢掉！”
    （三）英勇的救护员
    “喂！你下腮打掉了，赶快去找卫生长！”指导员望着一个提枪向敌人阵地冲过去的小战士、很关切地说。
    这个战士却一声不响，抢救他的同伴。指导员发急了，重复而又沉重地命令他回来。
    这个受伤的战士很吃力地回答：“我是卫生长张永昌！………”  ×          ×          
        ×          ×
    天明，连长从敌人死尸上摘了一支带刺刀的三八式给年青的卫生员张凤林，让他和另外的五个坚守当中的一间房子，抵抗路南十来米远反扑的敌人。
    敌人的手榴弹、小炮弹把院里打得昏天黑地，又在瞎诈唬：“赶紧交枪吧！”张凤林爬在自己守卫的枪眼下一动也不动，心里骂着：“缴我们的枪？哼！有种就过来！等一会儿缴你们的枪！”敌人一露头，他就把他打回去。
    敌人的反扑被打退了，各院里的彩号就挤到他这里，卫生器材使光了。同志们有的去把敌人的被子撕成绷带，有的卷布条，有的拆棉花，有的抬彩号，小凤林专管包扎，这个紧张工作的救护所就在打退敌人反扑的间隙中进行工作。
    反攻的时候，小凤林就提着手榴弹冲进路南敌人的阵地去消灭敌人了。
    （四）十一个人的反攻
    敌人打到无力反扑的时候，我们就组织了十一个人的反攻，势如破竹，一举打下了路南的独立院落。
    小炮兵杨长锁也提了步枪随着侦察员傅占明进去，把敌人打死的打死，打伤的打伤，活着的敌人爬到老乡床底下一直求饶………。
    人们把这批俘虏从床底下拖出来，杨长锁却走进老乡厨房里去搜索，柴火堆上一顶草帽在颤抖，掀开一看下面蹲了一个戴大盖帽的敌人。
    “枪那里！？”
    “没——有！官长！”
    “没有，通死你狗造的！”
    “我是打小炮的，炮在这里！”
    长锁接过小炮的时候，这个俘虏又说：“饶了我罢！给你这金子，………”
    “我们不要俘虏东西，天怪冷的，送给你这顶布帽子戴吧！你放心跟我走，八路军不杀俘虏！”
    （五）“小鬼！你回来啦！”
    当岳龙之从南面爬进拼光了的西屋里，敌人仍然用机枪封锁住门口，他就爬在门口的死尸下面悄悄监视敌人。
    敌人机枪射手一露头，小岳的子弹就飞过去了。打了老半天，敌人的射手始终没找见枪子是从那里射来的。最后，再也不敢伸出头来。从北屋窗洞里露出的人头上，都是戴的八路军帽子，小岳的心喜得快炸了！蹦到北屋墙根，才发现重机枪眼太小，赶快卸了身上的东西，才钻了进去。
    和连长吴永富一起，胆儿更大了。激战到援兵打进来，他的心才扑通一下落了地。
    当他胜利归来扑到连长赵春堂跟前的时候，连长捏住他的小手说：“小鬼，你回来啦！”
    有人故意问他：“小鬼，敌人没有缴了你的枪？”
    他很骄傲地回答：“成天缴敌人的枪，还让敌人缴了枪？！”
    （六）当胜利的时候
    电话员崔玉保蜷着腿坐在地上，双手交叉地抱着膝盖，把抬不起来的头放在上面，枪斜抱在怀里，电话机子放在身边。
    当巡视前线的某高级指挥员去慰问他的时候，他简直没有精神把头抬起来。可是，他胜利了，他兴奋得喃喃地说：“首长！副团长叫我们学习坚守张凤集的百名英雄；我们打退敌人七次反扑，我守的枪眼狗造的就没夺到过。后来，我又参加十一个人的反攻，提着手榴弹就冲上去。美国的六○小炮，日本的歪把子，三八式，人，全都拾动干净了。………”
