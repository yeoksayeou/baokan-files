    【This newspaper, Taihang, 19th of this month】During the fruit distribution in Beipo Village, Zuo Quan, the masses proposed to give priority to the families of military personnel. Thus, seven large northern rooms, an ox, and a rug were first distributed to Zhao Chunhua, a first-class textile hero in the Taihang region. Comrade Chunhua felt that although she was a family member of a military person, she had no worries about food and clothing, and said to the masses, "I don't want it." The masses said, "Your son joined the army and is a military family member, and your husband works and is a cadre family member; you led all the women in the village to learn weaving, and this time you led everyone in the struggle to overthrow the landlords. You have the most credit. You can't refuse." Comrade Chunhua said, "The credit belongs to everyone. I dare not take credit. The fruits should be given to the 'Ge Dao' households. Li Heidan and Li Shubao, brothers in our village, have been in the army for many years, and their houses are small and in poor condition. I am better off than them. Give these seven large northern rooms and an ox hide to them. I don't want the rug either. Give it to those in the village who have few quilts." When cadres and the masses received the fruits she gave up, they were all moved and said, "She is truly a hero." Later, Comrade Chunhua said to Zhang Guangsheng and three other cadres who had received more fruits, "We are activists among the masses, and everyone supports us. If we get more fruits, we will be detached from the masses. Moreover, workers such as the shepherd Zhang Mihuan and several other workers have not yet completely turned themselves around." After this specific explanation, Zhang Guangsheng and others were enlightened and gave up the extra fruits they had received.
    Also: Shexian County is inspecting the cadres' thinking and continuing to implement the decision to return the fruits of labor bought cheaply from the masses. After ideological reflection, all cadres in the Ninth District of the county unanimously decided that cadres who had cheaply bought fruits of labor in the past should immediately and voluntarily return them to the masses. The method of return stipulated that they should return to their original villages and make self-criticisms at village cadre meetings and mass meetings. Through this county-wide cadre ideological inspection, they are determined to serve the masses wholeheartedly in the future and are now returning the fruits of labor separately.

　　左权军属赵春花让出果实填圪道
    【本报太行十九日电】左权北坡村在分果实时，群众都提出先给军属分。于是就先给太行区一等纺织英雄赵春花分了七间大北房、一头牛、一个花毯。春花同志觉得自己虽是军属，可是不愁吃穿，给群众说：“不要。”群众说：“你儿参军是军属，你男人工作又是干属；你领导咱村全体妇女学会纺织，这次又领导大家翻身斗争地主，数你功劳大，你不要可不行。”春花同志说：“功劳都是大家的，我可不敢摆功，果实应给‘圪道’户。咱村李黑旦、李书保弟兄两参军多年，他的房子又少又不好，我比他俩强，这七间大北房和一个牛皮给他；线毯我也不要，分给村上被子少的人。”干部和群众接收她出让的果实，都感动的说：“人家真算起个英雄。”后来春花同志又和张广胜等三个多得果实的干部说：“咱们在群众中是个积极分子，大家拥护咱，如分果实多，就要脱离群众。再说放羊工人张米换等几个工人，还未翻透身。”这样具体解释后，张广胜等打通思想，退出了多得果实。
    又：涉县检查干部思想，继续贯彻退还贱买群众果实的决定，该县九区全体干部经过思想反省，一致决定命运中贱买果实的干部立即自动给群众退回去。退的方法规定退回原村，并须在村干部会及群众会上作自我检讨。经过这次全县干部思想检查，决心今后要全心全意的为群众服务，现正分别退还中。
