　　Jincheng No. 2 High School Extracurricular Production
    Earns 180,000 Silver Dollars in Nine Months
    Licheng Experimental Elementary School Collects Coal Cinders for Heating
    [This newspaper Jincheng News] The extracurricular production of students at No. 2 High School in this county has achieved excellent results, earning over 188,000 silver dollars in the past nine months. Production began in April of last year, with government loans used to open a pharmacy and a cultural cooperative, and to raise eleven pigs, in addition to the three mu of school land. The "three-seven" profit-sharing method was used in production, greatly boosting the students' enthusiasm. The three mu of school land, in addition to providing vegetables for their own consumption, also yielded four shi and one dou and five sheng of Jin Huang rice, two shi of castor seeds, 95 jin of cotton, 5,000 jin of radishes, 98 jin of indigo, and eleven shi of grain, worth a total of over 100,000 silver dollars. The cultural cooperative earned 40,000 silver dollars, the pharmacy earned 6,000 silver dollars, and pig and chicken raising earned over 30,000 silver dollars. All publicly funded students have been self-sufficient through production since July. (School Department)
    [This newspaper Licheng News] Students at Licheng Experimental Elementary School collected 900 jin of coal cinders within ten days around the solar New Year, saving 7,200 silver dollars. Before the New Year, the local people were busy with the work of liberation and could not deliver coal to the school in time, causing some children to be unable to concentrate on their studies due to the cold. Guo Dianfa, a second-grade student, voluntarily collected a basket of coal cinders from outside the school to provide heating for everyone. The school seized the opportunity to commend Xiao Guo and mobilized everyone to collect coal after dinner, resulting in over 900 jin in ten days. In addition to being used for heating in two classrooms, 600 jin remained. It is estimated that over 1,000 jin can be collected before the holiday.

　　晋城二高课外生产
    九个月赚洋十八万
    黎城实验小学自己拾炭烤火
    【本报晋城讯】本县二高学生课外生产成绩优良，去年九个月内赚洋十八万八千余元。从去年四月份起开始生产，除三亩校地外，由政府贷款开药房、文化合作社各一座，养猪十一口等。生产中用“三七”分红办法，同学们情绪极高。三亩校地，除供给自己吃菜，另收得金皇后四石一斗五升，蓖麻籽两石，棉花九十五斤，萝卜五千斤，靛九十八斤，谷子十一石，共值洋十万余元。文化合作社赚洋四万元，药房赚洋六千元，养猪、喂鸡等赚洋三万余元。各公费生从七月份起，全做到生产自给。（校部）
    【本报黎城讯】黎城实验小学学生，阳历年关十天内拾炭渣九百斤，节约洋七千二百元。年关前住地群众忙于翻身工作，赶不上给学校驮炭，冷得部分儿童无法安心学习。二年级学生郭殿法自动从校外拾回一萝头炭渣给大家烤火。学校抓住小郭表扬，发动大家晚饭后拾炭，十天中即得九百余斤。除两个教室烧用，还余下六百斤。估计到放假前还能拾千多斤。（实小通讯小组）
