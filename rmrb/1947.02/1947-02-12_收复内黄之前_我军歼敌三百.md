    Before Recapturing Neihuang
    Our Army Annihilated 300 Enemies
    [Report from the Jiluyu Front, February 9th] Before the Eighth Route Army recaptured Neihuang City, a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division and a battalion of the 30th Division, in coordination with a part of the puppet army, counterattacked our forces from Chu Wang (an area north of Neihuang) on the 3rd. They were annihilated with 300 casualties. The Eighth Route Army captured three heavy machine guns, more than ten light machine guns, more than one hundred rifles, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. The enemy and the puppet army unit of Cheng Daosheng, besieged in Neihuang City, fled west in a panic, and Neihuang was thus liberated. Now order in the city has been restored, and the residents, who have been ravaged by Chiang's and the puppet army for more than fifty days, have immediately launched a movement to accuse and settle scores.
