Taiyue, This newspaper, 18th. The Fifth District of Jincheng is clearing away the ideological obstacles to the large-scale production movement, calling on the masses to work hard to become rich. After the completion of land reform in the Fifth District, it is actively preparing for this year's large-scale production movement. At the beginning of this month, a meeting of 195 people, including various production experts and model cadres leading production, was held to discuss how farmers can become rich after their liberation. The discussion revealed several ideological concerns hindering production. For example, the village chief of Houjiang Village said with a sad face: "Many households in our village still haven't threshed their soybeans. They think that as long as they have enough to eat and drink, it's enough. Getting rich is troublesome, and we can't persuade them." Wang Dejin, a middle peasant from Cashandi, said: "I used to be able to work hard, but someone told me, 'People fear fame, pigs fear fat,' and I became increasingly discouraged and didn't want to move anymore." The reason was that the interests of middle peasants were damaged in the mass movement, causing everyone to have misconceptions. The leadership then addressed these ideas by proposing: "Labor creates wealth, sweat exchanges for it. Men till and women weave, abundant clothing and food. Work hard to seek wealth, the government guarantees it. Labor heroes, everyone should learn from them." "Landlords and bullies, bedbugs and lice. High rents and high interest, only eating and not working. One family exploits, everyone has nothing to eat. Mobilize struggle, should be taken back." Let everyone compare the difference between landlords getting rich and our labor getting rich, which aroused many people's long memories. Li Wenxi of Sijiazhang said: "In the past, I borrowed high-interest loans from the landlord and couldn't repay the interest. The landlord wouldn't let us celebrate the New Year. On New Year's Eve, I escaped to Lingchuan with nothing and spent ten years like that until the Eighth Route Army came and I returned home. In the past few years of rent reduction and interest suspension, I recovered several acres of land. Last winter, I filled in the gaps and became a middle peasant. Now everyone in my family is working very hard. Women spin half a catty of cotton every day. In addition to farming, I also carry goods. It was the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army who made me rich. Some people say that if you get rich, you will be struggled against, but I don't believe it unless he exploits others." Then, some people who had become rich after their liberation took the lead in speaking, clearing up everyone's confused thoughts. The deputy village chief of Dongshu Village said: "I can weave mats, and I will teach others to weave when I go back so that everyone can get rich."

Taiyue, This newspaper, 18th. Qinyuan held an expanded cadre meeting on January 24 to discuss various issues in large-scale production. Villages that have achieved the goal of "land to the tiller" should seize the time to prepare for production. In terms of ideological mobilization, the following three points should be emphasized: First, after farmers have uprooted the roots of poverty, they must firmly establish the roots of wealth. The government ensures everyone's land rights. If some have more land than they can cultivate themselves, they can hire workers. Second, landlords should follow the path of Zhang Yongtai, stand with the peasants, and participate in labor well. Those with money can invest in cooperatives for production. Third, publicize the burden policy: (1) For those with uncertain land numbers, they should be cleared up to achieve fair and reasonable burdens. (2) This year, cotton planting will still not be burdened; land planting is based on land assessment of output and is not counted as income. (3) Strive for fairness in supporting the service, and the government must pay attention to the adjustment of manpower and animal power in the future. Efforts should be made to achieve balance in the burden of support in a certain area.

　　晋城五区召开生产行家会议
    扫除群众怕富思想
    沁源扩干会议讨论大生产问题
    【本报太岳十八日电】晋城五区清除大生产运动的思想障碍，号召群众努力生产发家致富。五区完成土地改革后，积极准备今年大生产运动，本月初召开了一百九十五人的各种生产行家及领导生产的模范干部会议，讨论农民翻身后如何发家致富。讨论中发现几种妨碍生产的思想顾虑，如侯匠村村长愁眉苦脸的说：“我村现在还有许多户的豆子仍然未打，认为有吃喝就行了，发了财反是麻烦，咱们也无法劝导。”擦山底中农王德金说：“我过去很能艰苦劳动，有人对我说：“人怕出名猪怕肥”，越来越泄气，就再不想动弹了。”原因是在群运中损害中农利益，使大家发生了错觉。领导上便针对这些思想提出：“劳动发财，血汗换来。男耕女织，丰衣足食。下力求财，政府保障。劳动英雄，人人学习”。“地主恶霸，臭虫壁虱。高租大利，只吃不做。一家剥削，大家无吃。发动斗争，应该收回”。让大家比地主发财与咱劳动发财有何不同，引起了许多人沉长的回忆。司家掌李文喜说：“我过去借上地主的高利贷，还不起利，地主就不让咱过年，腊月除夕光身逃到陵川，这样过了十年，直至八路军来到我才回家，前几年减租减息我就收回几亩地，去冬填平补齐，我就上升为中农，现在我家里人都很起劲的劳动，女人每天纺半斤棉花，我除了耕地还去担挑运输，这都是共产党八路军叫我发了财，有人说富了就要斗争，我就不相信，除非他是剥削别人。”接着又有些翻身后发财的人争先发言，打通了大家的糊涂思想。东属村村副说：“我会打席，回去还要教会别人打，叫大家都发财致富。”
    【本报太岳十八日电】沁源于一月二十四日召开扩干会议，讨论大生产中各项问题，实现了耕者有其田的村庄，应抓紧进行生产准备，在思想动员上应着重以下三点：一、农民挖掉穷根后要好好安富根，政府确保大家的地权，如土地多一些的，自己种不过来可雇佣工。二、地主要走张永泰的道路，和农民站在一起好好参加劳动，有钱的可投资到合作社进行生产。三、宣传负担政策：（一）土地数目不确的要进行清理，求得负担公平合理，（二）今年种棉仍不负担；种地是按土地评议产量负担，不算收入。（三）支差力求公道，政府今后一定要注意人畜力的调剂，一定地区在支差负担上要求得平衡。
