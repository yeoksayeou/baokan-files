　　Min盟 Establishes American Branch
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] According to the Chongqing Democratic Daily on the 13th of last month: The American branch of the Min盟 was established in New York at the end of last October. Dr. Zhang Weiyou was elected as the chairman. The main responsible persons include musician Liu Liangqing. Most of the members are students, professors, and overseas Chinese. The main task at present is to organize people who sympathize with democratic China into the "Friends of Democratic China Society" to report on the Chinese people's democratic movement to the American people and gain the support of the American people. When the American branch of the Min盟 was established, American congressmen Pepper, DeLacy, and Lattimore, Wallace, Mrs. Roosevelt, and others sent congratulatory telegrams. Congressman Pepper said in his congratulatory telegram: "The United States should support a democratic China, but now the U.S. military is supporting a non-democratic force; therefore, they should be withdrawn."
