Most of the participants in the survey expressed that they love democratic fighters and peaceful life most, and hate corruption, civil war, and dictatorship most. The newspaper also published a letter from a reader in Huaiyin who participated in the survey, which stated: "I am telling you without lying, I am a young member of the Kuomintang, and naturally live in the 'recovered area'." His answers are: "Oppose the stationing of US troops in China; because it helps create civil war. Oppose the US policy towards China; because in order to defend the Soviet Union, it supports Chinese diehards and prevents China's modernization. Do not support the constitution (referring to Chiang's 'constitution'), because it cannot solve national affairs, love democratic fighters most, and hate tail-dragging parties most."
