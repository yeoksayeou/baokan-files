[Special Dispatch]

　　【Our Newspaper Special Dispatch】Around the New Year, Wu'an launched another county-wide mass movement to sweep away feudal remnants. At the beginning of the movement, the county leadership reviewed the passive approach during the autumn harvest, where a prolonged period of focusing solely on war preparations allowed landlords and special agents to take advantage of the situation, hindering the mass movement. They determined to actively mobilize the masses, thoroughly eliminate feudalism, and complete land reform to welcome the war. The approach was to let the masses investigate remnants (feudal remnants), cut off remnants, investigate gaps (poor households), and fill gaps themselves. At the same time, they focused on mobilizing the backward, mobilizing women, and uniting middle peasants. During the movement, various localities universally guided the masses to divide class lines, recognize feudal forces, stabilize the emotions of middle peasants, and then absorb them into the struggle. Middle peasants in the Eighth District generally changed their past wait-and-see attitude and fear, and they all accused the landlords of their crimes, which caused heavier blows to the landlords. In Zhaijia Village, Fifth District, landlords instigated middle peasants to eat and drink extravagantly; poor peasants persuaded the middle peasants as brothers, telling them that those who worked hard to build a family were all one family. If they did not struggle, the middle peasants turned to diligent production. Poor peasants in Chongyi took the initiative to help middle peasants resolve their difficulties, explained to the middle peasants who had offered land and property out of fear, and even the middle peasants who had been wrongly attacked in the past turned to hate the landlords and the old society and participated in the complaining. For backward peasants, village cadres and advanced masses were universally educated to inspire them to rise up and struggle. Village cadres also conducted self-criticism to everyone, reviewed the fruits they had obtained in the past, taking on everything themselves, not respecting the opinions of backward masses, etc., and guaranteed that everyone would speak as much as possible this time, and that the fruits of the struggle would be used to fill the gaps first. In Chongyi Village, backward peasants in each street were mobilized to discuss and decide which remnants to cut off and which gaps to fill, and they were allowed to do it themselves, resulting in a very thorough job. In Pian Shan, backward peasants who had not yet turned over were allowed to evaluate and distribute the fruits, thoroughly realizing the filling of gaps and making up for deficiencies. Many villages' debt collection struggles were pioneered by backward masses in the past. Backward masses in Nanhezhuang said: "Today I know that what we want is our own blood and sweat!" Hejinzhen (Jicheng) used the method of "skillfully hitting the point" (stimulating from the most painful point) to mobilize many backward masses. Guo Quanxin was very backward and often did not attend meetings. The director of the peasant association seized on his past painful experience when he was a hired laborer and was falsely accused of theft by the bully He Fuchun, and deliberately said to him: "What are you busy with all day long! Wasn't your time stolen?" This hit the sore spot, and Guo Quanxin resolutely demanded justice and fought the bully to the end. The cadres further guided him to unite with everyone and act together, and as a result, he became an activist. Sun Lubao, a hired laborer in Chongyi, used to hide in the corner whenever there was a struggle meeting. This time, he was inspired by the suffering he had suffered when he was a hired laborer. Not only did he actively struggle, but he also automatically joined the militia. Sun’s old mother used to think that struggle was unreasonable, and she did not dare to wear the clothes that were distributed to her. She did not dare to go out when she wore them, and she would hide when she saw people. The awakened masses guided her to recall that in the famine year, she was forced by the landlord to sell the land to the landlord at a charity price, and then forced to buy the grain plundered by the landlord at a high price. She finally struggled. She said: I used to say that poverty is fate, but today I know that it is exploitation that makes us poor! After in-depth mobilization, women participated in the struggle very commonly this time. Under the guidance of their own men and relatives or women cadres, they joined the peasant association and complained, calculated accounts, asked for debts, and took over shops together with men. Women in villages such as Datouzhuang and Dabeizhuang charged at the landlords in the posture of vanguards, and even struggled alone when the men in the whole village went out to transport, completing the task of cutting off remnants (Diatouzhuang). Cadres and the masses who used to underestimate women have now recognized the strength of women. After in-depth and meticulous mass mobilization and liquidation of debts and struggles in various villages, most of the feudal remnants were cut off, and leveling and replenishment were universally carried out. It is expected that in the three months before the spring plowing after the old year, various types of villages will successively enter the stage of ideological education and organizational rectification to thoroughly complete land reform.

　　划分阶级团结中农巧打一点发动落后
    武安放手让群众查尾巴填窟窿
    【本报特讯】新年前后，武安又掀起全县规模扫荡封建残余的群众运动。运动开始，县领导上曾检讨了秋收时长时期单纯备战，地主特务乘机活动，迟滞了群众运动的消极做法，确定以积极发动群众，彻底消灭封建，完成土地改革来迎接战争。做法是放手让群众自己查尾巴（封建残余），割尾巴、查圪洞（贫户）、填圪洞。同时着重提出发动落后，发动妇女与团结中农。运动中，各地普遍引导群众划分阶级，认清封建势力，稳定了中农情绪，进而吸收他们参加了斗争。八区一般中农都改变了过去的观望态度与恐惧，纷纷控诉地主罪恶，使地主受到更沉重打击。五区翟家庄地主挑拨中农大吃大喝；贫农均以兄弟之谊向中农解劝，告诉他们劳动发家的都是一家人，不斗争，中农乃转向勤俭生产。崇义贫农主动向中农解圪塔，对因恐惧而献田献财的中农进行解释，连以前错受打击的中农也转而仇恨地主与旧社会，参加了诉苦。对落后农民，则普遍教育村干与先进群众去启发他们起来斗争。村干部并向大家进行自我批评，检讨自己过去所得果实，包办代替，不尊重落后群众意见等，保证这次让大家尽量说话，斗出果实尽先填坑。崇义村发动各街落后农民自己讨论决定割那些尾巴，填那些圪洞，又放手让他们自己去干，结果搞得很彻底。骈山则让落后未得翻身的农民自己评议员分配果实，彻底实现了填平补齐。不少村庄的要账斗争，都是从前由落后群众打先锋。南贺庄落后群众说：“今天才知道咱要的是自己血汗！”贺进镇（继城）以“巧打一点”（从其最痛心处激发）的办法发动了许多落后群众。郭全信很落后，时常不去开会，农会主任抓住他以前当雇工时曾被恶霸贺夫春诬赖他偷盗的这块心病，故意对他说：“你一天忙啥呀！你那时光是不是偷来的？”这一下刺到了痛处，郭全信便坚决要伸冤，与恶霸斗到底。干部更引导他和大家团结起来共同行动，结果他变成了积极分子。崇义雇工孙禄保以前一开斗争会就躲到角里，这次从他当雇工时所受苦处上启发，不仅积极斗争起来，并已自动参加民兵。孙老太太以前认为斗争不合理，分给他衣服不敢穿，穿了也不敢出门，见人就躲；觉悟群众引导她回忆灾荒年被地主逼着义卖土地给地主，又被迫高价买吃地主掠去的粮食，她终于斗争起来。她说：我以前只说穷是命，今天才知道是叫剥削穷的！妇女经过深入发动，这次参加斗争也很普遍，她们在自己男人与亲属或妇女干部们诱导下，纷纷加入农会与男子一道诉苦、算账、要账、店头、大北庄等村妇女，均以先锋的姿态向地主冲锋，甚至在全村男子外出运输之时单独斗争，完成了割尾巴的任务（店头）。从前轻视妇女的干部群众，现都认识了妇女的力量。各村经过深入细密的发动群众与清算要账斗争，封建尾巴大部割除，普遍进行了填平补齐。预计旧年后春耕前的三个月内，各类村将先后转入思想教育与整顿组织阶段，彻底完成土地改革。（东）
