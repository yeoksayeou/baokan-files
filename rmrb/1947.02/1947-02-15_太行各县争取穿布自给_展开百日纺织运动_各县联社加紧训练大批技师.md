    Taihang Counties Strive for Self-Sufficiency in Cloth
    Launch Hundred-Day Textile Campaign
    County Cooperative Associations Intensify Training of Large Numbers of Technicians
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 13th] The spring hundred-day textile campaign has been widely launched in Taihang. This campaign is a general review of the entire region's textile industry and the textile work carried out over the past few years. The Third Administrative Office, Licheng, Pingshun, Wuxiang, Shexian, and many districts and villages have held joint meetings of cooperative societies, women's salvation associations, and other systems to organize all-out efforts to complete this large-scale cloth production plan. Licheng's plan is not only to guarantee self-sufficiency, but also to export 35,000 jin this spring, and to develop 4,000 more women weavers during the campaign, and add 500 more hand-pulled shuttle looms. With weaving women as the center, all textile women are organized so that each group has a loom. The Licheng County Cooperative Association's textile training class has been expanded into a factory. A large number of apprentices are recruited to train technical talents, and technicians like Gao Jiarui are sent to the countryside to train women weavers. All the weaving women in Qiushuyuan, Lubao, Xishuiyang and other villages have been organized into intensive weaving. In order to improve technology, Qiushuyuan decided to hold irregular product exhibitions. One was held on the thirteenth day of the first month, and 23 model workers have received bonuses from the cooperative society. Wuxiang called on all women in the county to change to wide cloth. The county cooperative association gave high prices for the purchase of wide cloth as an encouragement. Pingshun promoted two-wheeled large spinning wheels, mobilizing carpenters throughout the county to rush production, and the first district completed 300 large spinning wheels in five days. The county and district cooperative associations in Shexian are training technicians in large numbers, and textile committees have been established in counties, districts, and villages to specifically promote this work. The Shahe Dukou Village Cooperative Society and the flower room have unified the leadership of women's spinning work to fully serve the textile work. The production plans in various places are based on the standard of ensuring self-sufficiency in cloth and selling a part of it, and they have full confidence in completing the plan.
