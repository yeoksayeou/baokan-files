    Half-Month Battle Situation in This Region
    From February 1st to 15th
    Our Army's Encirclement of the Longhai Railway Line Has Taken Shape
    Military Region Headquarters
    A Major Battle is Brewing and About to Unfold Fiercely
    In the first half of February, the focus of the war in the Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield shifted to the Longhai front. While Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng were stationed in Xuzhou, actively adjusting their deployments and adopting a focal point strategy to plan the Battle of Southern Shandong, and transferring the 27th Army (including the 5th Army and the 75th Division) and the Rapid 2nd Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade) to reinforce Xuzhou, our Military Region's main force reappeared on both sides of the Longhai Railway Line (exactly half a year after the Battle of Longhai in August of last year), cutting off transportation between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou, forcing the 5th Army to halt in the area of Minquan and Shangqiu. At the same time, our army captured seven cities south of the Longhai Railway (namely Zhecheng, Taikang, Suixian, Boxian, Ningling, Qixian, and Luyi), annihilating the 16th Brigade of the 75th Division, which was rushing south to reinforce, in the suburbs of Boxian. By this point, our army had recovered and liberated twenty-four county towns north and south of the Longhai Railway, creating a favorable battlefield for encircling the Longhai Railway from both sides, disrupting Chiang Kai-shek's strategic deployment of concentrating troops in Xuzhou. This situation is more favorable to us than the self-defense counterattack operation along the Longhai Railway half a year ago; it leaves the flanks of the Chiang troops participating in the Battle of Southern Shandong completely exposed and under our army's serious threat, with both Xuzhou and Kaifeng sending out emergency calls.
    Under these circumstances, Chiang Kai-shek had to change his deployment and personally flew to Zhengzhou on the 4th of this month to give instructions, ordering the 85th Division, which was defending Xinxiang and its vicinity, and the 72nd Division, which had just been transferred from the border of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, to concentrate in the area of Kaifeng, Neihuang Station, and Yejigang; together with the 5th Army, the 75th Division, and the Rapid 2nd Column, the Chiang troops have concentrated more than eleven brigades in the area of Kaifeng, Minquan, Shangqiu, and Dangshan, attempting to launch a counterattack against our Cao-Shan area, to prevent our army's offensive on the Longhai Railway and ensure the safety of their transportation. The Second Battle of the Longhai Railway is brewing, and it is expected to unfold fiercely soon.
    The Pinghan Railway and the Chiang-occupied areas of northern Henan have become even more empty. The section of the Pinghan Railway from Qixian to Xinxiang is only defended by the remnants of the 41st Division and the puppet Li Ying's troops; the 32nd Division also had to abandon its arrogant attempt to control its mobile position north of the Wei River and wait for an opportunity to advance north, and instead headed south to Tangyin and Xinxiang; Daming and Neihuang were successively recovered by our army. Now, our powerful main force has captured several strongholds on the periphery of Hebi, annihilating five companies of the puppet Sun Dianying's troops, and repelled the reinforcement of the 106th Brigade of the 40th Division on the 9th, and annihilated a part of the enemy's 32nd Division on the 11th, and is now approaching Tangyin, continuing to expand the battle results.
    In addition, on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, Dong Zhao has concentrated his main force (including the 1st and 90th Divisions) near Linfen since the 8th of this month for rest and reorganization, preparing for new acts of folly, and his movements deserve close attention.

    二月一日至十五日
    本区半月战况
    我军夹击陇海线形势已成
    军区司令部
    大战正酝酿即将猛烈展开
    二月上半月的冀鲁豫战场，战争重点已转移到陇海前线。当蒋介石、陈诚坐镇徐州，正在积极调整布署，采取重点主义，策划鲁南会战，抽调整廿七军（包括五军、整七十五师）及快速第二纵队（即四十九旅）增援徐州之际，我军区主力又重新出现在陇海线两侧（距去年八月陇海之战，恰为半年），切断徐、郑间交通，迫使第五军不得不停滞于民权、商邱一线。同时，我军更在陇海路以南连下七城（即柘城、太康、睢县、亳县、宁陵、杞县、鹿邑），歼灭仓猝南援的整七十五师十六旅于亳县城郊。至此，我军在陇海线南北已经收复与解放了二十四座县城，创造了南北夹击陇海线的有利战场，打乱了限蒋介石向徐州集中兵力的战略布置。这一形势，比半年以前我军在陇海自卫反击作战时，对我更为有利；使参加鲁南会战的蒋军之侧翼完全暴露，处于我军的严重威胁之下，徐州、开封同时告急。
    在这种情况下，蒋介石就不得不改变他的部署，于本月四日亲自飞往郑州指示机宜，把守备新乡及其附近的整八十五师与刚从鄂豫皖边调来的整七十二师调集于开封、内黄车站、野鸡岗一线；连同五军、整七十五师及快速第二纵队，蒋军已在开封、民权、商邱、砀山一线集结十一个旅以上的兵力，企图向我曹单地区举行反扑，阻止我军对陇海线上的攻势，以确保其交通运输之安全。第二次陇海线大战正在酝酿中，预计不久即将猛烈展开。
    平汉线及豫北蒋占区，已更形空虚，平汉段淇县至新乡段，仅由整四十一师残部及伪李英部来担任守备；整三十二师也不得不放弃其控制于卫河以北机动位置待机北进的狂妄企图，南开汤阴、新乡；大名、内黄相继为我军收复。现我强大主力兵团已攻克鹤壁外围据点数处，歼伪孙殿英部五个连，并于九日击退四十师一○六旅之增援，十一日歼灭援敌三十二师一部，现正逼近汤阴，继续扩张战果中。
    此外，同蒲南段方面，董钊于本月八日起集结其主力（包括整一师、九十师）于临汾附近休整，准备作新的蠢动，其动向深堪注意。
