　　Taiyue Liberation Detachment Enters Intensive Training Climax
　　[This paper, Taiyue, 22nd dispatch] The Liberation Detachment's training is in full swing. Killing-the-enemy hero Jiao Wubao said: "This training must win us another model squad." When he first started throwing grenades, he could only reach 18 meters, but he was extremely motivated. He worked hard from dawn till dusk, and as a result of his hard practice, in five or six days, he could throw up to 25 meters. The artillery company uses the dusk time to dig fortifications, and when roll is called, they leave four people to continue digging. After roll call, everyone carries their cannons to practice. Comrade Yin Kui of this unit is a teenager, and at first he could only throw 17 meters. He was determined to throw over 20 meters within a week. As soon as it was light, he got up and took five or six grenades to the training ground to practice hard. In four days, he improved by nine meters. After a week of intense hard training, the comrades of the third squad of the sixth company can throw an average of 29.3 meters. A certain unit is currently practicing village battles, siege battles, shooting, and grenade throwing, which is very intense.

　　太岳解放支队进入练兵高潮
    【本报太岳二十二日电】解放支队练兵正热火朝天。杀敌英雄焦五保说：“这次练兵非再争一个模范班不可。”他开始投弹时只能投十八米达，但他劲头极大，起早搭黑，苦苦练习的结果，五六天功夫，便能投到二十五米达。炮兵连利用黄昏时间去挖工事，点名时还留四个人继续挖，点名后大家就扛着炮去练习。有的利用诊断时间，到野外去测量打炮距离。该部银魁同志是个十多岁的小鬼，开始才投十七公尺，他下决心一周内非投到二十余公尺以上不可。天刚明就起来拿上五六个手榴弹到操场苦练，四天中进步了九公尺。六连三班同志经一周紧张苦练，全班平均能投二九点三公尺。某部近日正演习村落战，攻坚战，射击投弹，十分紧张。
