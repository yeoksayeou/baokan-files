    Peking University Literary Federation and United Performing Arts Troupe
    Offer New Year Greetings to the Democratic Army of National Construction
    The United Performing Arts Troupe of Northern University and the Border Region Literary Federation went to the headquarters of the Democratic Army of National Construction on January 25th to perform a New Year's consolation performance. That evening, they performed three short song and dance dramas, "Labor Hero Li Shunda," "Model Armed Work Team Guo Xing," and "Wang Deming Supports the Government and Cherishes the People," which were well received by the soldiers. The next day, in order to entertain the First Army of the Democratic National Construction, they performed again in the square. When the performance reached the part where the soldier Wang Deming mistakenly drove away an old fellow's pig and then returned it to the old fellow, bursts of laughter and praise erupted from the crowd. On the evening of the 27th, "The White-Haired Girl" was performed, and the audience was particularly crowded, including not only comrades from the Democratic National Construction Army but also villagers from the village. When the play reached a tense point, the stage and the audience became one, and the audience shouted, "Down with the local tyrant Huang Shiren!"
    The troupe originally planned to go to the Second Army of the Democratic National Construction for a performance on the 28th, but due to a temporary invitation to the Lucheng Expanded Cadre Meeting, they rushed to Lucheng. After the performance in Lucheng, they will still go to the Second Army of the Democratic National Construction to offer their condolences.

    北大文联联合文工团
    新春慰劳民主建国军
    北方大学与边区文联联合文工团，于元月二十五日前往民主建国军总司令部，作新春劳军公演。当晚演出“劳动英雄李顺达”，“模范武工队郭兴”，及“王德明拥政爱民”三个小型歌舞剧，深受战士欢迎。次日，为了款待民建第一军，又在广场出演，当演到战士王德明也错赶了老乡的那口猪，又送还给老乡时，人群中爆发出赞扬的笑声。二十七日晚公演了“白毛女”，观众特别拥挤，除民建军同志外，还有该村的老乡们。当剧演到紧张之处，台上台下打成一片，观众高呼：“打倒恶霸黄世仁！”
    该团原拟于二十八日赴民建第二军公演，临时因潞城扩大干部会议邀请，又赶赴潞城，就在潞城演毕后，将仍往民建第二军慰劳。
