[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Chairman Yang spoke to reporters upon returning from comforting troops on the front lines of the Taiyue District and the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang, saying that in addition to representing the border region leadership in extending greetings to the military and civilians on the self-defense front lines of the Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts, he also inquired along the way about personnel from Party, government, and civil organizations at all levels, labor heroes, and enemy-killing heroes, attending their various meetings, for a round trip of about two months. Chairman Yang said: "My overall impression of the military and civilians of the Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts is – harsh environment, full of spirit. In terms of the scale of combat, Taiyue is smaller than Ji-Lu-Yu, but because it is located in a mountainous area with extremely inconvenient transportation, sparsely populated, and on a long battle line stretching from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the north to Wenxia and Pinglu in the south, and then east to Ji (yuan) Mengdaoqing, combat maneuvers often involve two or three hundred *li*, and all transportation depends on the most primitive means of transport, with even the 'Taiping carts' of the Ji-Lu-Yu plains rarely seen. However, the soldiers there do not have any complaints. If there were any complaints, it would be as they say: that last battle wasn't fought hard enough. Everyone has the determination and confidence to win. When I extended my condolences and respect to them, their courageous and fervent enthusiasm truly excited me. A widespread campaign to earn merit is underway, with enemy-killing plans being formulated. In response to the higher authorities' call to 'Carry out the Wang Keqin Movement,' the Taiyue District vigorously launched the 'Jiao Wangbao Movement,' achieving great results. In December, they exceeded their merit-earning plan for annihilating the enemy. The Taihang Fourth Sub-district Corps unanimously expressed their unwillingness to rest, always wanting to 'go down the mountain to fight,' which is truly moving. The broad masses, as a result of the implementation of land reform, all said with smiling faces: 'This time we have truly turned ourselves over!' In order to defend the fruits of the struggle, they are automatically and consciously joining the army and participating in the war. On my way from Gaoping to Yangcheng, I personally witnessed three villages completing their military recruitment tasks in just one day or even one night, and the morale of Party, government, and civil cadres is generally high, with very few falling ill. Inquiries revealed that one reason is that all kinds of work are easier to do after the masses have turned themselves over; the other is that although life is hard, the cadres understand that it should be hard, and they work very happily and live very happily." Chairman Yang said that in his nearly two-month journey, except for a few special circumstances, he did not hear any cadres expressing any opinions about their lives. The hardship of life and the relatively simple style of work are deeply worthy of praise.

Chairman Yang then elaborated on the Taiyue District's achievements in overcoming financial difficulties, the innovations in war support work, and the various experiences in fighting the enemy on the border and in the "grid network": "Although the various conditions in Taiyue are so difficult, it has achieved remarkable results in overcoming financial difficulties and ensuring the needs of the front lines. Since July of last year, in addition to the field army, all food expenses, allowances, and miscellaneous office expenses of Party, government, civil organizations, schools, and certain local military organs have almost all been self-sufficient, which is very rare. In terms of war support work, there have been many innovations, and scientific calculations have been made. For example, in the Battle of Yuanqu in December last year, one-third of the civilian labor force was saved due to prior scientific calculations. Generally speaking, the Taiyue war support work has achieved great results in saving civilian labor. The methods are: appropriately dividing labor to manufacture and store scaling ladders, springboards, etc.; improving stretchers, and organizing capable and tightly knit cadres to take charge. The liaison between the front-line headquarters and the logistics headquarters is close, accurately calculating the required civilian labor force and unifying its distribution, and the troops have also highly developed their love and cherishment of civilian labor, carrying their own ammunition as much as possible, with the command personally inspecting and sending back those that can be reduced or not used. This spirit combined with the scientific calculation of logistics greatly saves civilian labor. When stretcher teams go to the front line, they transport ammunition, food, and other supplies, and when they come back, they carry the wounded. Militiamen and civilians go to the front line and take time to sell their labor, highly maximizing the efficiency of war support without wasting any effort, which is an even better method. Labor hero Shi Zhenming has also implemented a variable labor organization for production labor and war support, implementing a 'cattle and donkey variable labor' and 'labor ticket' system to solve various problems in combining war support and production. These are all new creations for saving and regulating civilian labor, and are worthy of great promotion and praise. Hospital work is in worse condition than Ji-Lu-Yu, with very few surgical drugs and most internal medicine drugs being self-refined and manufactured. Equipment is particularly lacking, and the Second Sub-district Hospital even had to use ordinary saws for treatment, but thanks to the efforts of all the staff, the average discharge rate last year reached more than 70%. If conditions are improved and (new treatment methods) can be universally applied, the results will inevitably be even greater.

"In terms of fighting the enemy, as far as I know, the counties of Hongtong, Linfen, Fushan, Jicheng, Xiangling, Yuanqu, and Jiyuan are the best, especially Jiyuan's 'Du Ba Lian' is the most outstanding. It is the highest banner. It had initially completed land reform in frequent battles against the enemy in July last year. (Chairman Yang specially inscribed words for them, praising them as 'River Defense Fortress, Turned-Over Model') The Jiaozuo, Qinyang, Bo'ai, and Wenxian areas of the Taihang Fourth Sub-district are also doing very well. Yang Juhe and Ren Xiuhe are banners, posing a great threat to the Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in the Jiaozuo area of northern Henan. They have created many experiences in the past six months, with various unified organizational forms and diverse working methods, persisting in guerrilla warfare behind Chiang's army and protecting grain and manpower, progressing from anti-'counter-settlement' to land reform. Other organizations and forms of struggle, such as the 'Du Ba Lian'-style border militia joint defense, the Fushan-style 'spider web joint defense,' and the rotation team-style militia rotating combat, are all very good. The Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts have very rich experience in combating Chiang and Yan's 'counter-settlement' and 'surrender' policies. One of the most important experiences is: recognizing the nature of today's patriotic self-defense war. The policies of plunder, burning, killing, and raping implemented by the traitorous, dictatorial, and reactionary faction not only harm the interests of the broad masses, but also damage the interests of many landlords. Many landlords in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas also have the idea of ​​'changing the sky' (becoming the people's world) and see that Chiang and Yan are about to fail. Captured people have already thought back to the Eighth Route Army, and fled back to the liberated areas from the Chiang and Yan occupied areas. We should pay attention to distinguishing, uniting, and winning them over. The policies we adopted in the anti-traitor and anti-'counter-settlement' campaign are: First, resolutely suppress the extremely bad 'revenge team' special agents; second, adopt a striving policy towards those who have 'changing sky' ideas and actively engage in 'counter-settlement,' such as Quwo Xing, these people 'agreed on three chapters' (contents omitted) and all were implemented. In some places, the landlords said to the masses: The higher-ups (referring to Chiang and Yan) really have official business, so let's do a fake 'counter-settlement,' and the things are still yours. Third, in the border areas where our strength is dominant, adopt a united front to fight the enemy and combat Chiang and Yan's 'surrender' policy. The method is to investigate the reasons why the militiamen or cadres were forced to 'surrender' and provide solutions. According to the experience of the Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts, the reasons for the militiamen's 'surrender' are nothing more than difficult family lives and lack of ideological preparation. As long as appropriate solutions are provided, the vast majority of militiamen and cadres who were forced to 'surrender' will return quickly."

Chairman Yang powerfully concluded his talk by saying: "However, it must be pointed out that the combination of war and land reform, and war and production, are still issues that the Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts must strive to resolve completely in the future. The land reform movement in the Taiyue District was affected for a period of time after the outbreak of war last year, mainly because the two were not well combined. There is a lot of wasteland in some areas of Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts, and order has not been well established. Although there are various reasons, we must strive to solve this problem through the scientific organization of war and production. They have initially gained these experiences, and the leapfrog development of Taiyue textiles last winter can prove this. The combination of war support work and production mobilization has laid the foundation for this year's large-scale production movement."

Finally, Chairman Yang mentioned an incidental issue, that very few "cultural troop comfort" paintings and letters are sent to the Taiyue and Taihang Fourth Sub-districts, and he hopes that the entire region will work hard in this regard in the future.

Chairman Yang also mentioned the outstanding achievements of the Taihang Fourth Sub-district in resettling about 10,000 refugees from areas occupied by Chiang's army below the mountains, enabling them to live and produce in peace in the liberated areas, which is worthy of praise. He also emphatically mentioned that the family school of the Democratic Nation-Building Army, led by Madam Liu Xiuzhen, wife of Commander-in-Chief Gao, is well-run, combining learning and production, the content of learning is relevant to needs, the leadership is democratic, and the spinning production has achieved remarkable results. Some are already able to spin six and a half *jin* of first-class thread per month. Chairman Yang praised and respected her continuously. He also said that the families of cadres from various agencies in Yangcheng, Taiyue, and the families of troops in the Taihang Fourth Sub-district have all established such schools, and instructed the reporter to interview them in detail and publish them in the newspaper to promote the family learning and production movement in this area.

　　太岳区及太行四分区
    党政军民斗志高昂
    财经战勤有新创造
    杨主席前线劳军归来谈
    【本报特讯】杨主席自太岳及太行四分区前线劳军归来语记者称，彼此次除代表边区领导机关慰问太岳及太行四分区自卫前线的军民，并沿途询问各级党政民人员、劳动英雄和杀敌英雄、出席他们的各种会议，往返约两月。杨主席说：“我对太岳及太行四分区军民总的印象是——环境艰苦，精神饱满。就作战的规模说，太岳较冀鲁豫为小，但因处在交通极其不便、地广人稀的山地里，且在北起平遥介休、南至闻夏平陆，再东向济（源）孟道清这一绵长的战线上，作战转移动不动二三百里，而担当运输全部依靠最原始的交通工具，连冀鲁豫平原的“太平车”都很少。但是那里的将士们却没有什么怨尤，如果说有怨尤的话，便是像他们所说的：那回那回仗还打得不够痛快。每个人都具备着必胜的决心与信心。当我向他们慰问致敬时，他们那种勇毅沸腾的热情，真使我兴奋极了。普遍开展着立功运动，订立杀敌计划。为响应上级“开展王克勤运动”，太岳区猛烈掀起了“焦王保运动”，成绩很大，十二月份他们超过了歼敌立功计划。太行四分区兵团，一致表示不愿休息，总要“下山去打”，真令人感动。广大群众由于实行土地改革的结果，都目笑颜开地说：“这回真是翻透身啦！”为了保卫斗争果实，自动自觉的参军参战。我自高平赴阳城途中，亲见到一天甚至仅需一个晚上完成参军任务的村庄就有三个，而党政民干部的情绪普遍高涨，很少害病的，探问结果，一是群众翻身各种工作都好做了；一是生活虽艰苦，干部了解应该艰苦，工作得很痛快，生活也很痛快。”杨主席说，在他将近两个月的行程中，除了个别特殊情况外，他没有听到干部对生活有什么意见的。生活之艰苦与作风之比较朴素，深值表扬。
    杨主席继即详述太岳区克服财经困难，战勤工作上的创造，边沿及“格子网”里对敌斗争的种种经验：“太岳各种条件虽是那么地困难，但在克服财经困难保证前线需要上，有显著的成绩，他们自去年七月起，除野战军外，党政民机关学校和地方某些军事机关一切的菜金、津贴、办公杂支费几乎全部作到自给，这很难得。在战勤工作方面，有许多创造，作到了科学计算，如去年十二月垣曲之役，因事前经过科学计算，节省了三分之一的民力。一般说，太岳战勤工作节省民力成绩很大，其办法是：适当的分工制造及保存云梯、跳板等；改良担架，组织精干严密干部负责。前线指挥部与后勤指挥部之联系密切，精确计算所需民力，统一支配，而部队更高度发扬了爱惜民力，尽量自带弹药，指挥部亲自检查，能少用或不用者，则遣之回去，这种精神与后勤之科学之计算相结合，大大的节省了民力。担架队往前线去时运送弹药粮食等物，下来抬彩号，民兵民夫到前线，抽空卖工，高度发挥战勤效率，不浪费力量，更是好办法。劳动英雄石振明更实行了生产劳动与战勤之变工组织，实行‘牛驴变工’与‘差票’制度，解决战勤与生产结合上之种种问题。都是节省调剂民力的新创造，值得大大的提倡与表扬的。医院工作，较冀鲁豫条件差，外科药品很少，内科药品大部靠自己提炼制造，器材尤缺乏，二分区医院甚至不得不用普通的锯子割治，但在全体工作人员努力之下，去年的出院率平均达到百分之七十以上。如果条件改善，能普遍运用（新治疗法），成绩必然更大。
    “在对敌斗争方面，就我所知，以洪洞、临汾、浮山、冀成、襄陵、垣曲、济源等县为最好，尤以济源的‘杜八联’最特出，他是一面最高的旗帜，去年七月间在频繁的对敌斗争中已初步完成了土地改革。（杨主席特为他们题字，誉为‘河防堡垒，翻身模范’）太行四分区焦作、沁阳、博爱、温县等也作得很好，杨聚和与任秀河是旗帜，予占驻豫北焦作分区的蒋军以很大的威胁。他们半年来创造了许多经验，各种的一元化的组织形式与多样的工作方式，坚持蒋军后方游击战争与护粮护丁由反‘倒算’进至土地改革。他如‘杜八联’式的边地民兵联防，浮山式的‘蛛网联防’，轮战队式的民兵轮番作战等组织斗争形式，都是很好的。在打击蒋、阎的‘倒算’、‘自首’等政策，太岳和太行四分区都有很丰富的经验。其中首要一个经验是：认清今日爱国自卫战争的性质，由于卖国独裁反动派所实行的抢、烧、杀、奸等政策，不仅危害广大群众利益，而且一样损害了许多地主的利益。蒋军占领区中不少地主也存在着‘变天’（变成人民的天下）思想，看到蒋阎要失败。被俘的已经回想八路军，自蒋、阎军占区逃回解放区，我们对此应注意分别团结与争取。我们在反奸反‘倒算’中，采取的政策是：第一、对付极坏的‘复仇队’特务分子，坚决予以镇压；其次，对付有‘变天’思想、‘倒算’的积极的分子，采取争取方针，如曲沃兴这类分子‘约法三章’（内容略）结果都实行了。有的地方地主向群众说：上面（指蒋、阎）有公事实在没办法，咱们假‘倒算’吧，东西还是你的。第三、是我力量占优势的边沿区，采取团结对敌方针，打击蒋、阎‘自首’政策。办法是调查该民兵或干部被迫‘自首’原因，给予解决。根据太岳太行四分区经验，民兵‘自首’原因不外乎家庭生活困难，没有思想准备，只要加以适当解决，绝大部分被迫‘自首’的民兵干部很快便会回来的。”
    杨主席有力地结束他的谈话说：“但是，必须指出的，战争与土地改革及战争与生产结合，今后仍是太岳与太行四分区努力求得完满解决的问题。太岳区土地改革运动在去年战争到来后一时期曾受过影响，主要由于两者结合不好。太岳与太行四分区之某些地区荒地不少，秩序亦作得不够。虽有种种原因，但必须求得在科学的组织战争与生产中，来努力解决这一问题。他们已初步取得这些经验，去冬太岳纺织之飞跃发展可为证明，战勤工作与生产发动之结合创造，已为今年大生产运动打下了基础。”
    最后，杨主席附带提及一个问题、即“文化劳军”的画报信件，寄到太岳和太行四分区甚少，希全区今后向这方面努力。
    杨主席又提及太行四分区安置山下蒋军侵占区难民约万人，使得在解放区安居生产之优良成绩，值得表扬。更着重提及民主建国军高总司令夫人刘秀珍先生领导下之该军家属学校办得好，一面学习，一面生产，学习内容切合需要，领导民主，纺线生产有显著成绩，有的每月已能纺六斤半头等线，杨主席赞扬礼敬不置。他并说太岳阳城各机关干部家属及太行四分区部队家属均已设立这样的学校，嘱记者详为采访登诸报端，以推动本区家属学习生产运动。（展潮）
