Taihang Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Epidemic Prevention

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 21st] As the spring breeze thaws and the weather warms, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued instructions on hygiene and epidemic prevention, stating: Frequent warfare makes the development of disease disasters extremely easy. Currently, the scabies, typhoid fever, malaria, dysentery, and other diseases suffered by the people in the border areas are pointed out by residents. Various localities should strengthen hygiene and epidemic prevention work: 1. Provide the people with universal education on hygiene knowledge (combined with the people's hygiene habits), creating a mass-based conscious epidemic prevention movement, paying special attention to the education of women and children, and creating a new atmosphere of cleanliness and hygiene in rural areas. 2. Improve existing mass hospitals, medical cooperative societies, rural health care departments, etc., and greatly increase their number through public-private joint efforts. Unite new and old medical talents, and respect the status of doctors. Various localities should appropriately provide pulse examination gifts and surgical fees according to custom to ensure the livelihood of doctors. 3. Train a large number of new medical talents, especially veterinarians and midwives. 4. Educate doctors of Chinese and Western medicine to study and learn from each other, breaking down conservative and mutually despising habits. Medical teams should be organized to provide rotational medical care in epidemic-prone areas. It also calls on public hospitals in various localities to become leaders in the hygiene movement and help local governments train hygiene personnel.
