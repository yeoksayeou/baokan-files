　　Zaozhuang Revived
　　Niu Fen

　　Zaozhuang, a city ravaged by the Chiang army for three and a half months, has now been revived. In the workers' dormitories, in the offices of the Zhongxing Company, and in the sunny squares, there are mass gatherings everywhere, because they can now speak freely again. The speed at which work is being restored here is astonishing. In three days, hundreds of Chiang army bunkers have been completely demolished, and thousands of Chiang army corpses have been buried. Once these matters are over, the focus of the work is to get the chimneys smoking again. The workers sign in on the registers according to their old habits, and eagerly climb up the iron frames, peeking at the leaks in the water tanks and repairing the water pipes. If these are repaired, and the boilers are lit, the 2,000 kilowatt motors can be started, and the 70,000 citizens can enjoy the convenience of running water and electric lights. Therefore, despite the many problems, the workers are trying their best to fix them with great enthusiasm. One repairman said, "We must fix the pipes. If we can't fix them, we will use water buckets and small water tanks to fill them. We guarantee that three tons of water will be delivered to the city every minute." At the No. 4 Kiln Sujiayuan, the workers are enthusiastically discussing the restoration of the small mine. Once these four small wells are opened, thousands of people will be employed. The staff are discussing how to set up cooperatives. Even if the machines can't be turned on, everyone's life will still be guaranteed. In just over ten days, the appearance of Zaozhuang has been restored. The streets, which had been ravaged by the Chiang army, now have more than 400 vendors selling cloth, meat, and daily necessities. The two-mile-long city street is bustling with pedestrians. Since the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has invested heavily in production, prices have fallen rapidly. When the Chiang army was here, the price of raw oil rose to 3,000 yuan per catty, but now it only costs 100 yuan per catty in Northern currency. (Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 12th)

　　枣庄复活了
    牛芬
    枣庄这个被蒋军蹂躏了三个半月的城市，现在又复活了。在劳工宿舍里，在中兴公司的办公室内，在有阳光的广场上，到处都有群众的集会，因为他们现在又可以自由说话了。这里恢复工作进行的速度是令人吃惊的，三天工夫几百个蒋军碉堡已全部拆光，并且掩埋了上千的蒋军尸体。这些事情一过去，工作的中心就是使烟筒冒起烟来，工人们按着老习惯在簿子上签了到，争先爬上铁架，窥看水箱的漏洞和修补的水管，假如把这些修理好，锅炉里一燃起火，两千基罗瓦特的电机，就可转动起来，七万市民便可以得到自来水和电灯的方便了。因此尽管毛病很多，工人们却怀着极大热情想法修好。一个修理匠说：“一定要修好管子，修不成我们就用水筒小水箱灌。保证每分钟准有三吨水送到市内。”在四窑苏家园的工人们，正热烈的谈论着恢复小会，这四个小井一开，首先会有几千人得到工作，职员们则互商如何开办合作社。即使机器开不转，大家生活仍旧有保证。十几天内恢复了枣庄的市容，曾被蒋军糟踏的街道，现有四百多家摊贩摆出了布匹、肉类和日用百货。二里路长的市街上，行人往来如织，热闹繁嚣。自从工商局大量投出生产品后，物价迅速下跌，蒋军在时曾使生油每斤涨到三千元，现在一斤只须北币一百元了。（新华社山东十二日电）
