    Joining Our Army Brings Great Love,
    Newly Liberated Soldiers Bravely Kill the Enemy
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, 6th] Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Pu reports: In this battle to recover Shan County, southwest of Shandong Province, a portion of the soldiers liberated from the Kuomintang army's 88th Division, after joining the Eighth Route Army for only three days, cooperated to wipe out another unit of the 88th Division guarding the city. They originally belonged to the 186th Regiment of the 62nd Brigade and were liberated in the battle on the outskirts of Yutai on January 9th. They joined the Eighth Route Army on the 21st and entered the battle of Shan County on the 23rd. The unit they eliminated was the 3rd Battalion of the 63rd Regiment of the 21st Brigade, all belonging to Fang Xianjue's 88th Division, a direct line of Chiang Kai-shek. The reporter held a small forum with them, and they were in high spirits. Chen Zhangming, from Guangdong, captured four guns when attacking the city on the evening of the 25th. He told the prisoners his original number within the 88th Division, explaining that he had just arrived as well, and that the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners of war well, telling them not to be afraid. The day they joined the Eighth Route Army was the Lunar New Year. The company had a meal together, and the company and platoon leaders personally served them food, which greatly surprised them. After the meal, a forum was held to discuss the life and discipline of the Eighth Route Army, followed by marching and combat. Zheng Guosheng from Jiangxi and Mao Tingxue from Sichuan were machine gunners and, together with two other veteran Eighth Route Army soldiers, captured four rifles and a machine gun. Zheng Guosheng said, "In the Eighth Route Army, we have the right to speak, and officers lead the way in battle. The soldiers are all very happy, so how can we not win victories?"
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, 5th] Chiang's army detains Chiang's army officers and soldiers who were released by the Eighth Route Army and sent home. After the Eighth Route Army recovered Shan County, more than eighty Chiang's army officers and soldiers who had been detained were re-liberated. More than eighty Chiang's army officers and soldiers from the 3rd Reorganized Division, the 41st Division, the 5th Army, and the puppet army Zhang Lanfeng's units, who had previously been sent home by the Eighth Route Army, were successively detained and imprisoned by Chiang's army in that city while passing through Shan County. After the Eighth Route Army recovered the county seat this time, they were once again liberated from Chiang's army prison by the Eighth Route Army.
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, 5th] In the battle to liberate Shan County, of the Chiang's army officers and soldiers captured by the Eighth Route Army, 104 have been sent back to their hometowns, except for those who voluntarily remain to work with the Eighth Route Army and participate in the patriotic self-defense war. In addition, after the battle ended, 110 Chiang's army soldiers with colored markings were rescued by Eighth Route Army medical personnel and have now been given hope for a new life.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】新华社记者李普报导：这次收复鲁西南单县城之战，一部分从蒋军八十八师解放过来的战士，在参加八路军三天之后，即协同歼灭了守城的八十八师另一个部队。他们原属于六十二旅一八六团，在一月九日鱼台外围之战中解放过来，二十一号参加八路军，二十三号进单县战斗，被他们消灭的为二十一旅六十三团三营，都属于蒋介石嫡系的方先觉八十八师。记者和他们举行了一个小小的座谈会，他们情绪很高。广东人陈张明在二十五日晚上攻城的时候，缴了四支枪，他把自己原来在八十八师所属的番号告诉俘虏，说明自己也是刚来的，八路军优待俘虏，叫他们不要怕。他们参加八路军的那天，正是旧历元旦，连队上聚餐，连排长们亲自给他们端饭，使他们大吃一惊，饭后开了一个座谈会，谈了一谈八路军的生活和纪律，接着就行军作战。江西人郑国胜和四川人毛庭学是机枪射击手，和另外两个老八路军一起缴了四支步枪和一挺机枪，郑国胜说：“八路军有说话的权利，作战时长官领头，当兵的都很高兴，因此怎么会不打胜仗呢？”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】蒋军扣留经八路军释放回家之蒋军被俘官兵，八路军收复单县后，八十余被扣蒋军官兵重获解放。前经八路军遣送回家之蒋军整三师、四十一师、第五军及伪军张岚峰等部之八十余蒋军官兵，于行经单县时，先后被该城蒋军扣押入狱。此次八路军收复该县城后，他们重为八路军由蒋军监狱中解放。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线五日电】解放单县之战，八路军俘虏蒋军官兵除自愿留八路军工作参加爱国自卫战争者外，一百零四名已被遣送回籍。又蒋军彩号一百一十名于结束战斗后，经八路军医务人员抢救，现已获得再生的希望。
