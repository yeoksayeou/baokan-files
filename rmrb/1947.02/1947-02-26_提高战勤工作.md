　　Improving War Support Work
    Since October last year, when the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau called on the entire region's Party, government, military, and districts to implement scientific, rational, and precise calculations in order to support the long-term patriotic self-defense war, various localities have created many good experiences, achieving the requirements of saving manpower, materials, and financial resources. Frontline troops have rigorously practiced thrift in using civilian labor, and leaders at all levels have personally inspected and urged, with remarkable results. For example, the ratio of combat personnel to civilian labor expenditure in a campaign was one to four or even one to five or six at the beginning of the war, but now it has been reduced to one to one or one to one and a half.
    Recently, war support work in areas such as Ji-Jin-Yu, Ji-Nan, Taihang, and Taiyue has had many innovations: (1) Implementing a system of calculating work points for both war support and production, and for collecting materials, with regular settlements, learning from strengths and compensating for weaknesses, so that people on missions do not worry about their families, and production continues as usual without being delayed. (2) Implementing a work-point reward system. More points are given for going on missions to encourage those who go on missions, and fewer points for production. Implementing the exchange of labor between oxen and donkeys, because oxen cannot go on quick errands, the errands all fall on households with donkeys, so they sell donkeys and buy oxen. The method of exchanging labor between oxen and donkeys is, for example, an ox producing for one day counts as ten points, and a donkey going on an errand for one day counts as twelve points, so that both production and errands are resolved. Implementing more points for carrying more, such as carrying four dou of grain for sixty li counts as ten points, then carrying five dou for sixty li counts as twelve and a half points. Under this kind of reward, some people even carried one dan of millet (280 jin). (3) Even during participation in the war, idle time is used for production or selling labor, without wasting any time. (4) Implementing rational division of labor. Villages near roads support short errands, and villages far away support long errands. Eliminating the Kuomintang style of waiting for errands in the village, errands are supported when there are errands, and production is done when there are no errands, so that supporting errands and production are not delayed. (5) The organization and systematization of war support work. For example, three stretchers form a squad, and above the squad are platoons, companies, districts, and battalions. Self-supplied with cooks, propagandists, doctors, carpenters (to repair stretchers) and cobblers (to repair shoes), and self-prepared with dry rations, bowls, chopsticks, hemp ropes, quilts, shoe nails and medicines. All problems are solved by themselves, so as to "not disturb the government, not trouble the masses." Before departure, ideological mobilization is carried out, and everyone understands that supporting the front line is to defend their own fruits of liberation, and their morale is very high. The slogan "Sincerely and wholeheartedly care for the wounded, ensure that they are not frozen and are mentally happy" is put forward. Ammunition is carried on the way there, and war spoils are transported on the way back. At the end of the war, experiences are summarized to continuously improve war support work. (6) Unified leadership and calculation. The forward command and the logistics command maintain close contact. When the forward command decides on a combat mission, it simultaneously determines the number of civilian laborers to be used and informs the logistics command. The logistics command, according to the needs of the front and the registration of labor in various places, makes planned allocation and organization to adjust the farmers' busy and slack seasons of production and the troops' surplus and deficit of supplies, so that all aspects are reasonably taken care of. (7) On-site preparation of personnel and equipment. In the past, combat equipment (such as ladders, springboards, etc.) was transported by civilian laborers. Now, according to combat needs, the special commissioner's office allocates it to various counties for on-site preparation and preservation, saving transportation power and making supplies to the troops more flexible. Guides and other personnel are also trained and prepared in advance to avoid grabbing people randomly at the last minute. (8) Using auxiliary labor. Women, children, and the elderly are all organized to participate in the war and production. They treat the sick well, make shoes and sew clothes or help with short-distance transportation, replacing a large number of male laborers. All of the above has played a great role in saving manpower, materials, and financial resources, and improving work efficiency.
    At present, war support work is of extreme importance. Today's war is relatively modern, with medium and large-scale battles and large troop formations. Our economy is a decentralized, backward small-scale agricultural economy and small-scale handicraft production, coupled with inconvenient transportation. The contradiction between needs and supplies is very large. We must fully recognize the difficulties arising from this contradiction and overcome them with all our strength and methods. The condition for overcoming difficulties is the unparalleled enthusiasm of the liberated peasant masses to fight to defend their fruits after the land reform. As long as we are good at calculating and organizing, we will be able to resolve the above contradictions and overcome all difficulties.
    The main way to give full play to the strength of the masses and transform war support work is to organize. War support work is a complex and meticulous organizational work. The implementation of production and the exchange of labor between oxen and donkeys is based on organization and mutual labor assistance. The implementation of unified registration of civilian labor, rational division of labor, work-point rewards, equal value exchange, national adjustment, and the rear area supporting the front, turns war support into a planned and organized system. The economy in the past six months has proven that all those who do well in war support work are inseparable from the organization of the masses.
    Secondly, precise calculation, military-civilian cooperation. Work exchange, work calculation, and work rewards are all premised on precise calculation. Only precise calculation can combine diverse forms of labor into a flexible and efficient organism that serves the struggle, ensuring timely supply to the troops and maximum savings in civilian labor. On the basis of saving civilian labor, the local authorities should guarantee the needs of the troops, and the troops should, under the conditions of completing combat missions, try their best to save civilian labor. Both local authorities and the army should practice precise calculation and avoid waste, especially the troops should carry out strict and reasonable organization in the way of saving labor, and provide assistance in life, so that personnel on missions can exert the highest efficiency. Leaders at all levels should urge and inspect to ensure implementation.
    This year's tasks of production and war support will be heavier than last year, and at the same time, we must do better than last year. The experiences and creations of the past six months are valuable fruits. We call on Party, government, military, and civilian organs across the country to continue to summarize past war support experiences, promote war support creations, and complete this year's tasks of war and production.

　　提高战勤工作
    自从去年十月中共晋冀鲁豫中央局为支持长期爱国自卫战争、号召全区党政军区实行科学的合理的精确计算后，各地创造了许多好的经验，达到节省人力物力财力的要求。前线部队厉行节约民力，各级首长亲自检查督促，成绩卓著。如一个战役的作战兵员数与民力支付的比例，战争开始时是一比四甚至一比五六，现在则减低至一比一或一比一个半。
    冀晋豫、冀南、太行、太岳等区战勤工作最近有许多创造：（一）实行战勤与生产计工、采计工与计分办法，定期结算，截长补短，出差的人不挂念家，生产仍照常进行，不受耽误。（二）计分奖工制度。实行出差的多计分，生产的少计分、给出差的人以鼓励。实行牛驴变工，因牛不能快不支差，差务都落在有驴户身上，于是纷纷卖驴买牛。牛驴变工办法，如牛生产一天计十分，驴出差一天计十二分，使生产与支差同获解决。实行多挑多计分，如挑四斗粮走六十里算十分、则挑五斗走六十里就算十二分半。在这种奖励之下，有人竟挑到一石小米（二百八十斤）的。（三）虽在参战期间，亦利用空闲进行生产或卖工，不耽误任何时间。（四）实行合理分工。近的路村支短差，远村支长差。消灭在村候差的国民党作风，有差即支差，无差即生产，支差生产两不耽误。（五）战勤工作的组织化与条理化。如以三付担架为一班，班之上有小队、中队、区队、大队。自带炊事员、宣传员、医生、木匠（修理担架）和鞋匠（补鞋），自备干粮、碗筷、麻绳、被子、鞋钉和药品。一切问题自己解决，做到“不打扰政府，不麻烦群众”。出发前，进行思想动员，大家懂得支援前线是为了保卫自己的翻身果实，情绪很高。提出“诚心诚意爱护伤员，保证要使他们不受冻，精神愉快”。去时携带弹药，回来时搬运战利品。战争告一段落即总结经验，使战勤工作不断提高。（六）统一领导与计算。前方指挥部与后勤指挥部密切联系，当前方决定作战任务时，同时确定使用民夫的数量并通知后勤指挥部。后勤指挥部根据前方的需要和各地劳动力的登记加以有计划的分配和组织，以调剂农民生产的闲忙及部队供应的盈亏，使各方面都得到合理的照顾。（七）就地准备人员器材。以前作战器材（如云梯、跳板等）是由民夫搬运，现在则根据作战需要，由专署分配各县就地准备保存，节省转运力量，对部队供应更加灵便。带路向导等也是预先训练准备，以免临时乱抓。（八）使用辅助劳力。把妇女儿童老人都组织在参战与生产中。他们招待好病号，做鞋缝衣或帮助短距离运输，代替了大批男劳力。所有以上这些，在节省民力物力财力，提高工作效能上起了很大作用。
    目前战勤工作有极大的重要性。今天的战争是比较近代化的，当中的，大兵团的，大规模的战争，我们的经济则为分散的落后的小农经济、小手工业生产加交通不便。需要和供给矛盾很大。必须充分认识由这一矛盾所产生的困难并用一切力量和方法去克服它。克服困难的条件，就是土地改革后翻身农民群众为保卫果实而斗争的无比热情。只要善于计算和组织，必能解决上述矛盾，克服一切困难。
    发挥群众力量，改造战勤工作的办法，主要是组织起来。战勤工作是一个复杂细密的组织工作。实行生产与牛驴变工，即以组织起来，劳动互助为基础。实行统一登记民力，合理分工，计分奖工，等价交换，全国调剂，腹地支援土地，把战勤变成有计划有组织的体制。半年来经济证明，凡战勤工作做得好的，都与群众的组织起来不可分离。
    其次，精确计算，军民合作。变工、计工、奖工无一不以精确计算为前提。只有精确计算才能把多种多样的劳动组成一个为斗争服务的灵活而有效率的有机体，保证部队及时供应和民力最大的节省。地方在节省民力的基础上保证部队的需要，部队则应在完成战斗任务的条件下尽量节省民力。地方和军队均实行精确计算，力戒浪费，特别部队在省力的方式上加以严密的合理的组织，并在生活上给予帮助，使出差人员能发挥最高的效能。各级首长则应督促检查，保证实行。
    今年生产和战勤的任务比去年将更重，同时还要比去年做得更好。半年来的经验和创造是宝贵的果实。我们号召全国党政军民机关继续总结过去战勤经验，推广战勤创造，完成今年战争与生产的任务。
