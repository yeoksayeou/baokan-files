    Delivering New Year Gifts on a Snowy Night
    Liu Jun
    On the afternoon of the first day of the Lunar New Year, Comrade Jia Yun Jin, the district chief and vice-chairman of the armed forces committee of the Third District of Anyang, led a team of militiamen with New Year gifts from the government for the military families behind enemy lines and New Year cards for the people behind enemy lines, setting off for the occupied areas east of the Shuiye-Guantai Highway.

    The snow had been falling continuously for three days and nights without stopping, covering the mountains and fields in a silver blanket. They trudged through half a foot of snow, slipping and sliding, struggling to move forward. "Ouch! Another fall!" Just as the district chief got up, militia member Cheng Erhe fell again. The district chief quickly brushed the snow off Erhe's body.

    Erhe patted his backside with a smile and said, "Our democratic government really cares about the people. It's so dark and the snow is so heavy, yet the district chief and cadres are willing to travel forty or fifty *li* to deliver rice and flour to the poor. What does it matter if we militiamen fall a few times? Even if our bodies ache, our hearts are happy!"

    It was about midnight when they entered Village XX. A boy of fourteen or fifteen opened the door of a carpenter's shop. Seeing that they were from our side, he went up to the district chief and whispered, "You're here! The 'Homecoming Legion' bastards are arresting people everywhere. My dad doesn't even dare to sleep at home. I'll go get him for you."

    In less than five minutes, his father returned. "Comrades, you've arrived! It's very cold, have something hot to eat. The 'Homecoming County' demands everything, and we can't even eat well during the New Year. We don't have anything good, but we have something bad; just eat a little!"

    No matter what, they wouldn't let the old man start cooking. They hurriedly delivered the New Year cards to the village and the rice and flour to the military families, and then quickly went to Village XX, which was a little over half a kilometer away. They used each other as ladders to climb over the walls into the village, and snow poured down the vice-director Jia's neck. The enemy had placed thorns on top of the walls. After Cheng Erhe climbed over the wall and opened the west gate, he discovered that his hands had been pierced in several places.

    Like the previous village, the "Homecoming Legion" in this village, fearing our night attacks, had all retreated to the large strongholds.

    They went to the home of landlord Xu XX to deliver a New Year card. Xu XX happily said, "I haven't even wished you a Happy New Year yet, and you're already coming to pay me a New Year visit!" He quickly stretched out his arms to "make a bow". They returned the greeting and were pulled onto the *kang* ( platform bed), where they warmed themselves by the fire and chatted.

    "...The families in our village who were struggled against before always felt that the democratic government and the Eighth Route Army were no good. They secretly hoped for the Central Army. When the Central Army came, they demanded 400,000 from Li XX (a landlord) and 500,000 from Li XX (another landlord). They are now being forced into hiding. As for me, when the masses settled accounts with me before, they still took care of my family's livelihood. Now the 'Homecoming Legion' is taking and robbing, and it's simply impossible to live!" He sighed repeatedly as he spoke.

    They delivered ten *jin* of rice to a poor peasant's home, and she was so grateful that she couldn't speak. After a while, she looked at the district chief's face and said, "The Communist Party is truly my mother from a previous life!" She followed everyone to comfort many poor military families and people along the street.

    One military family was so moved after receiving the gifts that they cried: "We're all one family, seeing each other and saying a few words is enough. What are you doing bringing all these things?!" He pointed to the broken pots and jars scattered all over the floor of his home and said, "How can my seven or eight family members survive?! Even the little bit of rice and wheat we had saved to eat during the New Year has been taken by the 'Homecoming Legion'. Those things that are worse than pigs and dogs will definitely not have a good death one day!..." He was so agitated that he couldn't speak.

    Throughout the night, they visited many villages, bringing the democratic government's condolences and concern to the suffering compatriots behind enemy lines; at the same time, they further strengthened their confidence in victory.

    雪夜送年礼
    刘钧
    旧历正月初一的下午，安阳三区区长和武委会副主任贾蕴金同志，率领着一队民兵，带着政府给敌后军属送的年礼和给敌后人民的贺年片，向水（冶）观（台）公路以东的被占区出发了。
    接连着下了三天三夜的雪还没有住，满山遍野的一片银色，他们踏着半尺厚的积雪，一步一滑，艰难地赶着路。“哎约！又滑了一跤”，区长刚爬起，民兵程二合又跌倒了。区长忙给二合掸去身上的雪花。
    二合笑着拍拍屁股说：“咱们民主政府实在关心老百姓，天这么黑，雪这么大，当区长当干部的都能走上四五十里远，给穷人送米送面，我们民兵跌几跤算个啥？身子骨受点疼，心上也是痛快的！”
    约莫半夜了，他们才走进××村，叫开一家木匠铺，出来一个十四五岁的小孩，他看是咱们这边的人，就走到区长跟前悄悄地说：“你们来啦！‘还乡团’杂种们见人就抓，俺爹也不敢在家睡，我去给你们叫俺爹去”。
    不到五分钟，他父亲回来了。“同志们都来啦，天很冷，热些饭吃吃吧。‘还乡县’啥也要，过年也吃不上好的，没好有坏，随便吃上点吧！”
    他们无论如何不让老汉安锅；匆匆地给村里送了贺年片，给军属送了米面，就很快又到离一里多地的××村去了。他们搭人梯翻围墙进了村，雪灌了贾副主任一颈窝。敌人在墙头压有圪针，程二合翻进围墙，开了西大门以后，才发现他手上被刺破好几处。
    和前面那个村子一样，这个村里的“还乡团”怕我们夜间袭击，也都钻到大据点去了。
    他们到地主许××家递贺年片，许××喜欢的说：“我还没给你们贺年禧，你们倒来给我拜年来了！”赶紧伸展胳膊就“作揖”。他们还了礼，被拉到炕上，一边烤火，一边谈叙。
    “……我们这村被斗争的几家，以前总觉得民主政府，八路军不好，心上总是暗暗地盼望中央军。中央军来了，向李××（地主）要款四十万，李××（地主）五十万，他们现在都给逼得隐藏啦。说到我吧，以前群众清算我，还照顾我家的生活，现在“还乡团”连要带抢，简直没法活下去啦！”他说得一直唉声叹气的。
    又到一个贫苦农民家里送了十斤米，她感激的说不出话来。等了一会，她看着区长的脸说：“共产党真是我前生的娘！”她跟上大家沿街慰问了好些贫苦军属和群众。
    一家军属接到慰问礼物后感动得哭起来了：“一家人嘛，来看一面，说几句话，就够亲啦，还送这些东西干甚哩！”他指着家里狼藉满地的破锅破罐说：“你们看我这七八口人怎活？！连剩下来的一点预备过年吃的米麦都被‘还乡团’要光了。那些不如猪狗养的东西，总有一天不得好死！……”他激愤得说不上话来。
    一夜，他们走了好些村子，把民主政府的慰问和关切带给了敌后的受难同胞；同时也更坚定了自己胜利的信心。
