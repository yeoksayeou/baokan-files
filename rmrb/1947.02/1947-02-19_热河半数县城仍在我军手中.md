Xinhua News Agency, Ji Re Liao, 17th -- Nearly half of the counties in the entire Rehe province are still in the hands of the Eighth Route Army, namely Xinglong, Qinglong, and Jianchang in southern Rehe, and Wudan, Xinhui, Suidong, Jingpeng, Linxi, Lindong, Tianshan, and Lubei in northern and eastern Rehe. Last autumn, three million out of the four million people in Rehe Province consciously paid public grain to the democratic government. During this period, the people's armed forces continuously attacked the invaders and recovered lost territories. On September 25th of last year, Ningcheng was once liberated, and all 1,600 men of the 3rd Regiment of the 18th Division of Chiang's 63rd Army were annihilated. Only five days after withdrawing from Chifeng (October 9th), a main force of the Eighth Route Army appeared east of the Jin(zhou)-Cheng(de) road, recovered Jianchang, and annihilated two regiments of the puppet Northeast Security 4th Detachment. The local armed forces of the Eighth Route Army in eastern Rehe are active along the Beining line east of Suizhong and Shanhaiguan. According to statistics from the local armed forces in Suizhong alone, in January, they eliminated more than 200 members of the local puppet police brigade. In the area north of the Jin-Cheng line and east of the Ye(baishou)-Chi(feng) line, a consolidated base area with a radius of 500 li has been established in the past year, making the rule of Chiang's army in Xin'yi County unstable. In the western Rehe area, the local armed forces active between Chengde and Chifeng, according to statistics for only 20 days from October 25th to November 15th last year, liberated important strongholds such as Huangtuliangzi, Dong'erdaohuzi, and Wangyedian. The Eighth Route Army in western Rehe recently advanced into Weichang, restoring large areas, and once recovered Fenshi (west of Luanping), Guojiatun, and Xidage Town (west of Fengning), important towns in western Rehe. From November 15th last year to the end of January this year, according to incomplete statistics from eastern and central Rehe (southern and western Rehe not included), the people's armed forces fought a total of 163 battles, killing or wounding 1,123 Chiang's army officers below the battalion commander level, capturing 333, killing or wounding 772 Chiang's bandit troops, capturing 374, and seizing 7 mortars, 39 light and heavy machine guns, and 1,151 rifles and carbines.

    【新华社冀热辽十七日电】热河全境县城仍有将近半数在八路军手中，即热南之兴隆、青龙、建昌三县，与热北热东之乌丹、新惠、绥东、经棚、林西、林东、天山、鲁北等县。去年秋季，全热河四百万人口中即有三百万人民向民主政府自觉缴纳公粮，在此期间，人民武装不断打击进犯者，收复失地。去年九月二十五日一度解放宁城，蒋军六十三军十八师第三团一千六百余人全部被歼。仅在撤离赤峰（十月九日）五天之后，八路军主力一部又出现于锦（州）承（德）路东，收复建昌，歼伪东北保安四支队两个团。热东八路军地方武装活跃于绥中及山海关以东之北宁沿线，仅据绥中地方武装统计，一月战果计消灭该地伪警察大队逾二百余，在锦承线以北叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线以东地区一年来开辟了方圆五百里巩固了的根据地，使得新义县蒋军统治不稳。热西地区活动于承德赤峰间的地方武装，仅据去年十月二十五日至十一月十五日二十天的统计，即解放黄土梁子、东二道河子、旺叶店等重要据点所在。热西地区八路军复于最近挺进围场，恢复大片地区，并曾一度收复热西重镇繁什（滦平西）郭家屯、隆化西大阁镇（丰富西）等地。自去年十一月十五日至今年一月底，热东、热中（热南热西未统计入）据不完全统计，人民武装共作战一六三次，毙伤蒋军营长以下一一二三名，俘三三三名，毙伤蒋记土匪七七二名，俘三七四名，缴获迫击炮七门，轻重机枪三十九挺，步马枪一一五一支。
