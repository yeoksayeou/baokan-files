　　Taihang Second Military Sub-district Bomb Factory
    Streamlines Half of Administrative Staff
    [Our Dispatch] In order to produce more weapons to supply the front lines, the Taihang Second Military Sub-district Bomb Factory has streamlined its personnel and improved efficiency. This year, half of the factory's twenty-two administrative staff members have been cut, and all remaining cadres and office workers are participating in production in addition to their own work. Factory Director Comrade Zhang Ziying personally joined the completion team and modified two tools: he changed the manually cranked windlass into one pulled by livestock, saving four people's labor per day; and he invented a detonator frame, saving more than five times the labor. In addition, instructors, accountants, purchasing agents, storekeepers, and communicators were organized into a group to help the completion teams with light tasks such as fusing and rolling paper tubes. The management platoon leader took time to turn large wheels in the sand-casting team, and the cook helped dig earthen shells whenever he had time. The entire factory is engaged in intense production work. (Yang Hongyuan)

　　太行二分区炸弹所
    精简半数行政人员
    【本报讯】太行二分区炸弹所精简人员，提高工效，以造更多武器供应前线。该所二十二个行政人员今年减去一半，每个干部和事务人员除本身工作外，剩余劳力全部参加生产。所长张子英同志亲自加入完成班工作，并改造了两种工具：将用人力绞的风胡芦改为用牲口拉，每天节省人力四名；又发明了导火器一架，节省人工五倍以上。此外，指导员、会计、采购、保管、通信员等编为一组，帮助完成班子导火、卷纸管等轻便工作。管理排长抽出时间到翻沙班转大轮子，火夫一有功夫就去完成土挖壳子。全所投入紧张的生产工作中。（杨鸿源）
