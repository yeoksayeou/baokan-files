　　US Cotton Dumping Seizes Market
    Hundreds of Cotton Factories in Pudong Close Down
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] Shanghai Wenhui Daily reports: Cotton cultivation in the Pudong area has been forced into bankruptcy due to the dumping and exclusion of US cotton and the exploitation of usurious loans. In the past, at its most prosperous, many towns in the area had dozens to hundreds of cotton manufacturers, but now they have all closed down. The signer's checks cannot be cashed, so farmers' cotton cannot be sold either. This situation has caused unprecedented rural unrest, affecting nearly eight out of ten farmers in Pudong.

　　美棉倾销夺走市场
    浦东数百棉厂倒闭
    【新华社延安十一日电】沪文汇报载：浦东一带种植棉花，已因美棉之倾销排斥，及高利贷剥削而陷于破产。过去最繁盛时，该区许多市镇上均有数十家至数百家的棉花厂商，目下已全部倒闭。签者之支票无法兑现，因此农民之棉花亦无法出售，此种情形已引起农村空前骚动，被牵连者几占浦东农民十分之八。
