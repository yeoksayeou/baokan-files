Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 11th: Comprehensive London news: Since the heavy snowfall that began in Britain on the 4th, the freezing weather has plunged the British Isles into an unprecedentedly miserable situation. The resulting coal shortage, due to transportation being blocked by heavy snow and severe cold, has forced the Labour government to implement its electricity rationing plan, announced on the 7th, starting at 8 a.m. on the 10th. The implementation of this plan has caused a nationwide shock. At 10 a.m. on the 10th, all of England, from the southeast coast through London and the Midlands to the northwest, experienced power outages in homes, pubs, shops, banks, and most schools. It is estimated that about 25 million people have been affected. In industrial areas, many factories have to close for several days a week, so 500,000 workers in London are already in a state of semi-unemployment, and 5 to 6 million workers elsewhere will be in the same situation.

    电力限用工厂陷于停顿
    【新华社延安十一日电】综合伦敦消息：自四日英国普降大雪以来，冰冻气候已使英伦三岛陷于空前悲惨情况。由于运输为大雪及严寒所阻塞，而造成的煤荒，结果迫使工党政府于十日晨八时起实行其于七日宣布的限用电力计划。该计划之实行，已引起了全国的震动，十日晨十时，全英格兰从东南海岸经过伦敦与中部直至西北，家庭，酒馆、商店、银行，及大部学校，均已停电。据估计约有两千五百万人，受到影响。工业区域许多工厂一周内得关门数天，因此伦敦已有五十万工人处于半失业状态，而其他各地则将有五百万到六百万工人处于同样情况。
