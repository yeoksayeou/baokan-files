Thoroughly Investigate and Eliminate Hidden Landlords
Tian Lin

Spring plowing is approaching, and various regions in the district are intensifying and completing land reform. However, the standards and extent of completion vary from place to place. What exactly is the standard for completing land reform? To what extent should landlords be eliminated, and to what extent should poor and landless peasants be filled in? I would like to offer the following opinions based on my personal understanding for everyone's consideration.

According to reports, in En County, all landlords except the orphaned, widowed, elderly, and weak have been "eliminated," but some have only been reduced to the status of rich peasants. In the Sixth District, landlords reduced to rich peasants account for as much as 35 percent. Because the Party's land policy does not eliminate rich peasants, it is easy to think that "landlords have been eliminated" or that it is not necessary to continue reducing them after landlords are demoted to rich peasants. However, this is inappropriate. Landlords cannot be equated with rich peasants. Even rich peasants with feudal characteristics participate in major labor, and part of their wealth is obtained through labor. We know that the land property of the landlord class is entirely plundered from the peasants, and driving them out of their homes is not enough to compensate for the losses of peasants' blood and sweat. Therefore, in order to enable them to maintain their lives and provide them with conditions for transformation, labor, and building a home, it is sufficient to leave them land equivalent to or slightly more than that of middle peasants. This should also be the peasants' gift and leniency to the landlords after the peasants have thoroughly settled accounts, the landlords have thoroughly compensated the peasants for their losses, and have bowed their heads to admit their mistakes to the peasants. The article "Zhang Yongtai's Road" in the Liberation Daily states "Landlords should retain land equivalent to or slightly more than that of middle peasants" and the editorial in this newspaper on November 5th of last year emphasizes that care and liquidation cannot be equated. I think this is the meaning.

After the land reform in the three villages of Qizhigong Castle, Beizhaolin, and Yahou Lizhuang was "completed," the leadership believed that the twelve landlord households that had been reduced to middle and poor peasants still retained an average of 92.5 mu of land per person, which was about twice that of middle peasants (middle peasants averaged 56 mu per person). It cannot be considered that the landlords have been completely eliminated. (Note: After a recent inspection of the three villages, it was believed that the only problem left was unfair distribution of fruits, which is worth discussing.) Leaving too much land for landlords to use will inevitably prevent poor and landless peasants from obtaining sufficient farmland. It also creates the conditions for them to change their appearance and continue to exploit and parasitize. The experience of rent reduction in Taihang for several years has fully proved this point. Only by leaving no more than middle peasants' land can the conditions for exploiting peasants be completely and permanently removed, and they will have no choice but to truly engage in labor production and will not be able to develop into landlords again, so that the feudal remnants can be completely eliminated. In addition, if too much land and property is left, it will inevitably become the material condition for them to continue to carry out reactionary sabotage activities and plot restoration in secret. Therefore, they must be thoroughly liquidated, and then, depending on their degree of repentance, land not exceeding the average yield of middle peasants should be given separately. As the saying goes, "To cut grass, you must remove the roots." Only in this way can the landlord class be eliminated forever. This is the standard for thoroughly eliminating landlords.

The meaning of "land to the tiller" is to enable landless and land-poor peasants to obtain sufficient land for cultivation. The editorial in this newspaper on fair compensation stated: "Leveling up and making up is generally a matter of moving both ends without disturbing the middle." My personal understanding is that the little land that the landlord is left with after a thorough liquidation should only be roughly equivalent to the level of middle peasants, and at the same time, the land of poor and landless peasants must be filled up to roughly reach the level of rich peasants, that is, landlords, poor and landless peasants should take from middle peasants to level up. Commander-in-Chief Zhu also pointed out in a broadcast: "The peasant masses, especially farm laborers and poor peasants, should obtain the benefits of land reform on the basis of equal distribution." I think the so-called basis of equal distribution means that the land and output of poor and landless peasants must reach a level equivalent to that of middle peasants or the average land per person in the whole village or the average output per person in the whole village. Unless it is a village where the land is too scattered and particularly barren, it is generally entirely possible. This should be the standard for leveling up and making up.

After the land reform in Qizhigong Castle, landlords retained an average of 9 mu of land per person, rich peasants 7.7 mu, middle peasants 6 mu, poor peasants 3.4 mu, and landless peasants 1.2 mu. In fact, this village neither completely eliminated landlords nor completely leveled up and made up. If calculated according to the principle of moving both ends without disturbing the middle and the principle of equal distribution among poor and farm laborers, the situation is as follows: 76 landlords, 1084.7 mu of land; 82 rich peasants, 742.2 mu of land; 346 poor peasants, 990.6 mu of land; 25 landless peasants, 24.2 mu of land. Excluding middle peasants, the average land per person is 5.3 mu. Adding 695 middle peasants with 3818.6 mu of land, the total average land per person in the village is 5.4 mu. If an average is taken of the landlords and poor and landless peasants, excluding middle peasants, each person can get 4.7 mu, plus part of the land withdrawn from feudal rich peasants, the poor and landless peasants can reach roughly equivalent to the total land average of the village. If this is done, the poor and landless peasants can obtain sufficient land for cultivation, and the landlords will still have enough to maintain their lives. After studying the editorial in this newspaper in light of the actual situation of the movement in the Fourth District of Qinyuan, it was also believed that a thorough liquidation of landlords could generally achieve the "Geda" of leveling up the landless and land-poor peasants. The Central Bureau's instruction to the Jinnan District Party Committee in December of last year also mentioned: "If the middle peasants do not agree to push for leveling, then thoroughly liquidate the local tyrants and landlords excluding the middle peasants, and carry out a movement to extract fat and compensate for thinness and level up and make up. Give houses to those without houses, give land to those without land; give more houses to those with fewer houses, give more land to those with less land to ensure that feudal landlords are eliminated and landless and land-poor peasants have land to cultivate." Generally speaking, the standard for completing land reform is that feudal landlords are eliminated to the level of middle peasants, and poor and landless peasants are also filled up to the level of middle peasants.

Some places have already done this and achieved satisfactory results. In Wang Erzhuang, Wu'an, the average land per person in the whole village is 3.4 mu. As a result of the thorough liquidation of local tyrants and landlords, except for the middle peasants who did not change, the poor and landless peasants were compensated to an average of 3.7 mu per person. After the land reform in Licheng, the poor and landless peasants had an average of 1.8 mu of good land per person, with an output of 3.6 shi, all reaching the living standard of middle peasants (middle peasants averaged 2.6 mu of land). In the above three villages, middle peasants accounted for 56.8 percent of the total population in Gongbao Castle, 61 percent in Wang Erzhuang, and 51.7 percent in Nanweiquan. They were not villages with particularly concentrated land, nor were they villages with particularly scattered land. They all moved both ends toward the middle to level up. Not to mention the villages where the land is more concentrated. Therefore, generally speaking, truly eliminating landlords and cutting off the feudal tails of rich peasants can truly fill up the poor and landless peasants. However, after the land reform in En County, 35 percent of the poor peasants in the Sixth District are still left, 63 percent in the Second District of Qinghe, and 68 percent in the Fourth District. The average land for poor peasants is only 2.2-3.5 mu. In the 48 villages of the Second District of Xiazhen, there were originally 1,789 poor peasant households, and now there are still 447 households left, which is far from leveling up and making up. Are these areas where feudal landlords have not been thoroughly eliminated? Or is it due to unfair distribution of fruits or is it truly due to insufficient land? It is still worth a good in-depth inspection.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu especially emphasized in his New Year's Day broadcast that he opposed land reform in name only and that landless and land-poor peasants should truly obtain the benefits of land reform. Some places fill up according to 3 mu, thinking that poor and landless peasants have obtained 3 mu of land is considered to be filled up and considered to have completed land reform. In fact, it may be in name only. After the land reform in Wu Guanying, Jize, although the poor and landless have obtained an average of 3.9 mu per person, the average yield is only 2.65 shi. On the other hand, landlords still have an average of 6.07 mu of land per person, with an output of 4.22 shi, and rich peasants have an average of 9.6 mu of land per person, with an output of 8.6 shi. Landlords and rich peasants not only have one to two times more land than the poor, but also three times more output. Therefore, not only is 3 mu filling up not necessarily up to standard, but even in places where the amount of land tends to be average, it is still necessary to see whether the soil quality is good or bad and whether the output is also roughly the same. The difference in output between good and bad land in Taihang can be as much as ten times, which is worth noting.

In the in-depth turn-over and inspection in various places in the district, many problems have been discovered in many places. It is best to check the cadres' thinking first: 1. Is the concept of thoroughly eliminating landlords and leveling up and making up clear? 2. Have they emphasized taking care of landlords in the past? 3. Is there a "close enough" mentality and complacency? Because if the cadres' thinking is not clear, unlawful landlords will not be allowed to take advantage of loopholes, and inspections should be stepped up repeatedly to track down hidden landlords who have not been thoroughly eliminated. Accumulating five thousand years of feudal exploitation in China, the landlord class maintained by the feudal rule is not only very brutal and ferocious, but also very insidious and cunning. When faced with land reform in the liberated areas, which will end their class fate in history, they will do everything possible to make a dying struggle and plot restoration after being defeated. According to inspections in various places, some backward masses and even individual village cadres are sheltering landlords. Some landlords are hiding through false enlightenment, false mortgages, false separation of families, false struggles, and false cries of poverty. Some have infiltrated financial departments and production agencies, and some have infiltrated village leadership groups and militias. Even in some mountain villages, landlords are still at large and have not been liquidated. Even those who have been economically defeated are still carrying out counterattacks in secret, threatening to buy over cadres and the masses. Some are still hiding guns, red documents, and "change the day" accounts in an attempt to restore their rule. Now we should follow up and track down, repeatedly search, and thoroughly eliminate landlords economically and politically.

How to investigate hidden landlords? There are many methods, the most basic of which is to mobilize the broad masses to investigate. In some places, in addition to holding meetings of cadres and activists to examine and reflect to break the "close enough" mentality and raise class consciousness, special attention has been paid to mobilizing backward peasants and women. Changzhi proposed: "If we cannot eliminate backwardness, we cannot eliminate landlords," and launched a movement to eliminate backwardness. Shexian, Wu'an and other counties have used the method of investigating classes to draw clear class boundaries, dispel the concerns of middle peasants, and clarify and isolate hidden landlords and feudal rich peasants. Kuangmen in Shexian confessed to handing over the hidden赃物of landlords after the 18 dog-legs repented and confessed. Peasants in Changzhi, Licheng, Lucheng and other counties have universally launched a movement to dig "air-raid shelters," proposing: "Resolutely separate from landlords," and reported hidden赃物one after another, and finally broke with landlords. Peasants in the Third District of Changzhi reported that they had given more than 6,000 mu of land hidden by 430 landlords and many other assets. In some places, landlords' guns, "change the day" accounts, and red documents were also found, and the peasants further recognized the insidious and cunning nature of the landlords, and their class consciousness was greatly improved. Experience has proved that only by mobilizing the broad masses to investigate can landlords be completely eliminated, and finally eliminate their residual influence and consolidate the results of land reform.

　　彻底清查消灭隐蔽地主
    田林
    春耕将届，该区各地正加紧进行与完成土地改革，但完成的标准和程度各地还不很一致，究竟什么是完成土地改革的标准？地主应消灭到什么程度，赤、贫农应填补到什么程度呢？仅就个人了解提出以下意见和大家研究。
    据报导，恩县地主除孤寡老弱外已全部“消灭”，但一部却只降到富农，六区地主降为富农的即达百分之三十五。因为党的土地政策并不消灭富农，所以地主降为富农后，就容易认为“地主已经消灭”或不必继续往下降了。但这是不妥当的，地主不能和富农相提并论，即使是带封建性的富农，也参加主要劳动，他的财富的一部亦为劳动所获，我们知道地主阶级的土地财产则全系掠自农民，将其扫地出门尚不足偿还农民血汗损失。因之为了使其能维持生活，并予以重新转变、劳动建家的条件，而留给相当于中农或稍多于中农的土地就足够了。而这也应该是在农民彻底清算，地主彻底偿还农民损失并向农民低头认错以后农民对地主的恩赐与宽大。解放日报论张永泰的道路一文中“给地主保留相当于中农土地或稍多于中农土地”及本报去年十一月五日社论中强调照顾与清算不能平列的提法，我想即是此意。
    企之公城堡，北赵林和衙后李庄等三个村土地改革“完成”后，领导上认为已下降为中、贫农的十二户地主，每人平均仍留有九十二亩半地，约为中农二倍（中农每人平均五十六亩）。不能认为地主已消灭彻底了。（按：该三村最近经过检查，认为遗留的只是果实分配不公问题，值得商讨。）给地主留用的土地过多或太多，必然使赤下贫农不能获得足够的耕地；同是亦即可能成为其改头换面继续剥削，寄生的条件，太行几年减租中的经验已充分证明了这点。只有留给不超过中农的土地，才能完全并永远去掉其剥削农民的条件而不得不真正从事劳动生产，并不能再发展为地主，才能将封建残余扫除净尽。此外，如留给的土地财物过多，必不可免的成为其继续暗中进行反动破坏活动及图谋复辟的物质条件。因此必将其彻底清算，然后再视其悔过程度，分别给予不超过中农平均产量的土地。俗话说：“斩草必须除根。”只有这样才能使地主阶级永远消灭，这就是彻底消灭地主的标准。
    耕者有其田的意义即是使无地和少地的农民获得足够耕种的土地。本报关于公平补齐的社论中曾提出：“填平补齐大体上是中间不动两头动。”我个人的了解，即彻底清算地主分给地留的少地只能大致上相当于中农水平，同时填补赤、贫农民的土地亦必达到大体上达平于富农水平，即是地主、赤贫、贫农向中农取平。朱总司令曾在广播中亦指出：“使农民群众，特别是雇农、贫农在平均分配的基础上得到土地改革的利益。”我以为所谓平均分配的基础，即是说必须使赤贫和农民的土地和产量均达到相当于中农程度或全村每人平均土地或全村每人平均产量。如果不是土地过分分散和特别贫瘠的村庄，一般说是完全可能的。这应该就是填平补齐的标准。
    企之公城堡土地改革后，地主平均每人仍留有地九亩，富农七亩七，中农六亩，贫农三亩四，赤贫一亩二。实际上这个村既未彻底消灭地主，又未彻底填平补齐。如按中间不动两头动，和贫、雇农平均分配的原则来计算，情形如下：地主七六人，地一○八四·七亩，富农八二人，地七四二·二亩，贫农三四六人，地九九○·六亩，赤贫二五人，地二四·二亩。中农除外每人平均地五·三亩。加上中农六九五人，地三八一八·六亩，全村总平均每人为五·四亩。如果来一个中农除外的地主和赤、贫农的两头平均，则每人可得四·七亩，再加上封建富农退出的一部土地，赤、贫农民即可达到大体上相当于该村土地总平均数。如果这样作的话，赤、贫农即可获得足够耕种之土地，而地主亦仍足够维持生活。沁源四区联系运动实际情况研究本报社论后，也认为彻底清算地主后一般的即能达到填平无地和少地农民的“圪道”。去年十二月中央局给冀南区党委的指示中亦提到：“如中农不同意推平，则实行中农除外的彻底清算恶霸地主，抽肥补瘦填平补齐运动。没房给房，没地给地；房少补房，地少补地务使封建地主消灭，无地少地的农民有地可耕。”一般说，封建地主消灭到中农水平，赤、贫农亦填补到中农水平，才算土地改革完成的标准。
    有的地方已经这样作了，而且取得了圆满成绩。武安王二庄全村每人平均土地三·四亩，彻底清算恶霸地主结果，除中农没有变动外，赤、贫农每人平均补到三·七亩。黎城土地改革后，赤、贫农每人平均一·八亩好地，产量三·六石，全部达到中农生活水平（中农平均地二·六亩）。以上三村，公城堡中农占总人口百分之五六·八，王二庄中农占百分之六一，南委泉中农占百分之五一·七，都不是土地特别集中，也不是土地特别分散的村子，都作到了两头向中间取平，土地集中的村子就更不用说了。因此一般说真正消灭地主及割掉富农封建尾巴即可以真正填平赤、贫农。但恩县土地改革后，六区贫农还剩百分之三十五，清河二区还剩百分之六三，四区还剩百分之六八，贫农平均土地仅只二·二——三·五亩。夏津二区四八村中原有贫农一七八九户，现尚余四四七户，离填平补齐尚远，这些地区究竟是封建地主没有消灭彻底呢？还是果实分配不公抑或真正由于土地不足？还值得很好的深入检查。
    朱总司令元旦广播中特别强调反对有名无实的土地改革，要使无地少地的农民，真正获得土地改革的利益。有的地方按三亩填平，认为赤、贫农获得三亩地就算填平，就算完成土地改革了，实际上可能是有名无实的。鸡泽吴官营土地改革后，赤、贫平均每人虽已获得三·九亩，而平均产量却仅二·六五石，另一面地主每人平均却尚有地六·○七亩，产量四·二二石，富农每人平均地九·六亩，产量八·六石。地主富农不仅土地比赤贫多一倍到两倍，产量更多到三倍以上。因此不仅三亩填平不一定合标准，就是土地数目趋于平均的地方，也还要看地质的好坏和产量是否也大体相差不远。太行好坏远近地产量相差可达十倍，值得注意。
    该区各地深入翻身检查中，不少地方已发现许多问题。检查最好先检查一下干部的思想：一、彻底消灭地主和填平补齐的观念是否已经明确了？二、过去是否强调了照顾地主？三、是不是有“差不多”思想和自满情绪？因为如果干部思想不明确，即不会让不法地主钻空子，应加紧反复检查并追击尚未彻底消灭的明暗地主。积中国五千年封建剥削，封建统治维持的地主阶级，不仅是非常残暴、凶恶，而且是非常阴险和狡猾的，当其面临解放区土地改革，将在历史上结束其阶级命运时，必尽一切方法作垂死的挣扎，并在被打垮后图谋复辟。根据各地检查，部分落后群众甚至个别村干包庇着地主，有的地主以假开明、假典假当、假分家、假斗争、假哭穷等方法隐蔽起来了，有的钻到财经部门、生产机关，有的钻进村领导集团和民兵中，甚至有的山庄小村地主仍逍遥法外未被清算。就是经济上已打垮的，还有的在暗中进行反攻，威胁收买干部群众，有的还保藏着枪支、红文书和变天账企图复辟。现在应跟踪追击，反复搜索，将地主从经济上和政治上彻底消灭。
    如何清查隐蔽地主？方法很多，最基本的是发动广大群众来清查，有的地方除开干部积极分子会，其反省检讨打破“差不多”思想，提高阶级觉悟外，特别注意了发动落后农民和妇女。长治提出：“消灭不了落后就消灭不了地主”，掀起消灭落后运动。涉县、武安等县都用查阶级办法划清阶级界限，解除了中农顾虑，澄出和孤立了隐藏的地主和封建富农。涉县匡门正经过划阶级，十八个狗腿悔过坦白献出地主隐藏赃物。长治、黎城、潞城等县农民普遍展开挖“防空洞”运动，提出：“坚决和地主分家”，纷纷报出隐藏赃物，最后与地主撕破脸。长治三区农民即自报出给四百三十个地主隐藏的土地六千多亩，及其他资财甚多。有的地方并搞出地主枪支、变天账和红文书，农民更加认识了地主阴险、狡猾本质，阶级觉悟大为提高。经验证明只有发动广大群众来清查方能彻底的把地主消灭，并最后清除其残余影响，巩固土地改革成果。
