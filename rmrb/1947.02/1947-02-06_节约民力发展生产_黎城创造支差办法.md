	Conserving Civilian Labor and Developing Production
	Licheng Creates Methods for Supporting Public Work
	(1) Dividing Areas into Long and Short-Term Service Zones, Adjusting Throughout the County
	(2) Scoring and Using Service Tickets, Settling Accounts on Time
	(3) Integrating Public Work with Production Organization

	[Reported by our Taihang Correspondent, February 2nd] Licheng County has several innovations in its public work system, which have greatly reduced the burden of corvée labor on the people. In particular, the division of areas into long and short-term service zones, the county-wide adjustment of public work, the scoring and use of service tickets, and the integration of public work with production are all worthy of reference by other areas. According to a recent summary issued by the county: In order to solve the difficulty of excessive public work in villages along the main roads, in addition to firmly implementing the county and districts' control over the allocation of public work, the villages along the Handan-Changzhi and Licheng-Liao counties highways are designated as short-term service zones and are not required to perform long-term services. If the short-term service is still excessive, the county will adjust manpower and animal power from other villages, or make adjustments in grain and monetary burdens. Each village organizes a Public Work Evaluation Committee (one person is elected from every ten or fifteen households), which scores each household's manpower and animal power every six months for the purpose of allocating public work. Each village also issues service tickets in four categories: public service, obligatory service (same as participation in war), substitute farming, and miscellaneous service. When civilians return to the village after performing public service, the logistics director fills out and issues a ticket. Accounts are settled every three months (or according to the production season), and those who have performed more than their share of the work are paid in rice, based on the average wage of a middle-level worker in the mutual aid group. This solves the past shortcomings of unfair service and difficult allocation. Since it is stipulated that regardless of manpower or animal power, carrying ten catties (approximately 11 pounds) back and forth sixty li (approximately 19 miles) counts as one point, with one point for every catty and a system of "fixed points, flexible work," where more carrying earns more points and less carrying earns fewer points, and since the burden of points per household has already been assessed, people of all ages and genders are willing to perform public work to earn points, greatly expanding the scope of public work. In integrating public work with production, Ren Village in the county divides into three public work brigades, which are also production mutual aid brigades. A larger portion of the manpower and animal power specializes in outside production, while another portion operates workshops in the village to be available for public work at any time. Whether it is public work or production, points are recorded based on the strength of labor, and after deducting the number of public work points each household is responsible for, dividends are distributed according to points. Dongguan Village has service plates, which are managed by the production team leader on a rotating basis. When the service plate is passed to a certain group, that group does not go far for production.

    节约民力发展生产
    黎城创造支差办法
    （一）划分长短差区全县调剂
    （二）评分使用差票按时结账
    （三）支差与生产组织相结合                
    【本报太行二日电】黎城差务工作有若干创造，大大减轻了人民差役负担，特别是划分长、短差区，全县调剂差务，评分与使用差票，支差与生产结合三点，值得各地参考。据该县最近发表之总结称：为解决沿大路村庄差务过重的困难，除坚决执行县区掌握拨差外，特划邯长、黎辽两公路沿线村庄为短差区，不支长差。如短差仍过多时，由县调其他村人、畜力调剂或在粮款负担上予以调剂，各村均组织有差力评议委员会（十户或十五户选一人），每半年按各户人、畜力评分一次，按分支差。各村均制有差票，分支差，义差（参战同），代耕，杂差四种，民户出差回村由后勤主任填发。每三月（或按生产季节）结账一次，出差超过其应负担分数者得米，以互助组中之中等工资为标准。这样解决了过去支差不公，拨差困难等缺点。由于规定了不论人、畜力以负重十斤，往返六十里为一分，一斤为一厘，死分活计，多运多顶分，少运少顶分办法，而以户为单位之负担分数又已评定，因之各户男女老幼均愿支差顶分，大大扩大了支差面。在支差与生产结合上，该县仁村分三个支差大队，亦即生产互助大队。以较大一部人畜力专门出外生产，而以另一部在村经营作坊以便随时应差，无论支差或生产均按劳力强弱记分，分红时扣除各户应负担之支差分数后按分分红，东关村则制有差牌，由生产小组长掌握轮流，差牌传至某组，某组即不远出生产。
