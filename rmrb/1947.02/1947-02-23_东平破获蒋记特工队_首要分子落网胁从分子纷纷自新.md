　　【Reported by this newspaper from the Jilu豫 area on the 20th】Dongping County has smashed Chiang Kai-shek's spy team. The spy ringleader, Liang Jiusi, and others have been arrested. Those who lost their way have repented to the government and started anew. As of now, more than 60 people have repented and started anew with the democratic government. The Chiang spies organized a rehabilitation work team (also known as the Party and Government Work Team) in Dongping, led by Geng Jing'an, the county head of Dongping under Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhang Zhibu, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang in Dongping, to carry out sabotage activities covertly in Dongping. Their organizational structure had two detachments under the rehabilitation work team: The first detachment leader was Liang Jiusi, with five groups under him, and there were also five armed platoons in name; the second detachment leader was Wang Daoyin, with ten groups under him, including a political propaganda group, which specialized in spreading rumors and propaganda. Their activities were extremely secretive, and they appeared in various guises to carry out activities. The main culprit, Liang Jiusi, used selling yarn as a public cover. Their sabotage activities were: (1) Investigating the names, birthplaces, and resumes of our cadres and miscellaneous personnel in various organs, the number of public assets and their storage locations, the location of rear factories, and the unit numbers and numbers of troops, reporting them to Jinan at any time and waiting for an opportunity to sabotage. (2) Luring and organizing the remaining armed forces of bandits and traitors (such as Li Shouben, etc.) to assassinate our individual cadres in peacetime, collect militia guns, and undermine our mass organizations, and organize riots when the situation became tense. (3) Creating rumors, distributing leaflets everywhere, and posting notices to create the idea of ​​a change of regime among the masses and disrupt our social order. (4) Luring and organizing backward intellectuals and local bullies and ruffians, appointing them as officials with letters of appointment and using "insurance when the Central Army arrives" as a deceptive means to expand the organization. After this case was discovered by us on the 23rd of last month, the main members, Liang Jiusi, and others have been arrested one after another, and important evidence such as official seals, letters of appointment, badges, and rosters have been obtained.
