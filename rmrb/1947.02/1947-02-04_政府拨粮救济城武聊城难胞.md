　　[Report from the Jilu Yu Front, Our Newspaper, 27th] (Delayed dispatch) After the town of Chengwu County was captured by the Eighth Route Army on the night of the 16th, the democratic government returned to the town on the morning of the 17th to restore social order. It issued a proclamation calling on personnel of the puppet organizations to repent and surrender, calling on landlords who had fled to return home, and mobilizing the masses to dismantle the fortifications built by the enemy so that the masses could move freely. The masses were all very happy and said, "When the Chiang troops were here, we had no freedom to enter or leave the town, but now it's great." During the Chiang troops' occupation of the city, a large number of residents were forced into bankruptcy, and many innocent residents were brutally murdered. The democratic county government has allocated 10,000 jin of grain for relief. Various businesses in the city have now resumed operations one after another.
　　[Report from Jilu Yu, Our Newspaper, 30th] After the recovery of Liaocheng, the Jilu Yu Border Region Democratic Government allocated 200,000 jin of rice to relieve the refugees in the city, and most of it has now been distributed. For those who were made homeless by the destruction of houses by the traitor Wang Jinxiang, assistance is provided with timber and bricks to rebuild their homes.

　　政府拨粮救济城武聊城难胞
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】（迟到）城武县城于十六日夜为八路军攻克后，十七日上午民主政府即回城恢复社会秩序，并发出布告号召伪组织人员悔过自首，号召逃亡地主回家，并动员群众，拆除敌人所筑工事，以便群众自由出入。群众都异常高兴的说：“蒋军在时咱们进城出城都没有自由，这下可好了。”蒋军侵占该城期间，迫使大批居民倾家荡产，并有很多无辜居民惨遭杀害，民主县府已拨粮一万斤进行救济，现城内各种商业，已相继恢复。
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】聊城收复后，冀鲁豫边区民主政府为救济城内难民特拨二十万斤米，现已发放大部。对被王逆金祥拆毁房屋无家可归者，则帮助木材砖瓦重建家园。
