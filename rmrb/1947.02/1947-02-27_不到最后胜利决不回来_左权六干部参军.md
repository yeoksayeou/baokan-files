　　We Will Not Return Until Final Victory
    Six Cadres from Zuoquan Join the Army
    [This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] On February 14th, at an enlarged cadre meeting in Zuoquan County, twelve district cadres, including the former Tian Xiang (Director of the Fifth District Armed Forces Committee), voluntarily signed up to join the army. They were inspired to enlist by the call to "Defend the fruits of the masses' liberation and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's invading army." After strict screening, when six comrades, including Yuan Tianxiang and Xia Lianjiang, were found qualified and had their wishes fulfilled, the entire audience applauded to congratulate them. They then stood up and swore: "We will not return until final victory!" (Shi Min, Jing Tang, Qian Xiang)
