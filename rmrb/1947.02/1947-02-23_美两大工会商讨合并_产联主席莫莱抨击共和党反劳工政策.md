　　US's Two Major Unions Discuss Merger
    CIO Chairman Murray Criticizes Republican Anti-Labor Policies

    (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th) According to a French news agency dispatch from Washington on the 19th, CIO Chairman Murray, while testifying before the Senate Labor Committee today (note: the chairman of the committee is the notorious Republican Taft), stated that the majority party "Republican Party" in Congress should correct its attitude towards labor issues, otherwise, the United States will fall into more economic crises. Murray condemned the Republicans' attempt to use the help of "monopoly groups" to undermine trade unions. Murray also stated that Congress should not only refrain from passing anti-union bills but should also ensure that "national income is better distributed."

    (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th) According to a French news agency dispatch from Washington on the 17th, a spokesman for the CIO announced today that the organization's vice president will meet with the vice president of the American Federation of Labor on the 18th to discuss the possibility of a merger between the two major unions. The spokesman did not indicate whether such an agreement is likely. Prior to this, CIO Chairman Murray had twice called for a nationwide labor conference on December 6th of last year and January 6th of this year to formulate a common program and implement democratic cooperation among all labor organizations to safeguard the basic interests of the labor community. In order to cope with Murray's above-mentioned cooperation proposal, American Federation of Labor President Green sent a letter to Murray on February 1st, proposing a countermeasure of "organizational merger" of the two major unions, intending to swallow up the CIO. Murray declined to comment on Green's suggestion.

　　美两大工会商讨合并
    产联主席莫莱抨击共和党反劳工政策
    【新华社延安廿日电】据法新闻社华府十九日电，产业工会联合会主席莫莱，今日于出席参院劳委会（按该会主席为臭名昭著之共和党人塔虎特）作证时称：国会中的多数党“共和党”应纠正其对劳工问题的态度，否则美国将陷入更多的经济危机之中。莫莱谴责共和党企图借“独占集团”之助，来破坏职工会。莫莱并称：国会不仅不应通过反工会法案，而且应使“国家收入得到更好的分肥。”
    【新华社延安二十日电】据法新闻社华府十七日电，产业工会联合会发言人，今日宣称：该会副主席将于十八日与美国劳工联合会副主席座谈，研讨二大工会合并之可能性。该发言人未表示此种协议，是否可能。在此以前产联主席莫莱曾于去年十二月六日及今年一月六日，两度呼吁召开全美劳工会议，制订共同纲领，实行各劳工团体的民主合作，以保卫劳工界的基本利益。美国劳工联合会主席格林，为了应付莫莱上述合作的建议，乃于二月一日致函莫莱，提出两大工会“组织上的合并”的对策，意欲吞并产联。莫莱对格林的建议拒绝评论。
