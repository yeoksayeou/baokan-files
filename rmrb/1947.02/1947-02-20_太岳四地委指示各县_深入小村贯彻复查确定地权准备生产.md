Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee Instructs All Counties
    Deeply Implement Re-examination, Determine Land Rights, and Prepare for Production

    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Eighteenth Dispatch] The Fourth Prefectural Committee recently instructed all counties to continue implementing land reform and promptly shift to preparing for this year's large-scale production campaign. It stated roughly: All four counties in the region—Wangwu, Shimin, Jincheng, and Gaoping—completed land reform in January. Yangcheng, Jiyuan, and Yuanqu will also complete it by the end of this month. However, several problems still exist: First, the movement is uneven; many small villages have been left out in the counties that have concluded the movement. Second, individual counties have infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, and this has not yet been resolved. Third, some villages have not yet completely distributed the old stored fruits to the masses. Fourth, some villages have already distributed land, but land rights have not been determined. Therefore, it is necessary to continue conducting re-examination and promptly carry out preparations for the large-scale production campaign. First, leaders must immediately overcome complacency and correct the phenomenon of neglecting small villages. Second, conduct re-examination: A. Is the fruit distribution reasonable? Are there any feudal vestiges left out? B. How is the policy towards middle peasants being implemented? Have the losses of middle peasants been compensated? C. Has the old stored fruit been thoroughly investigated? Have cadres and activists withdrawn the excessive fruit they received? D. Determine land rights, demarcate boundaries, clarify ownership, and establish new contracts. Third, reorganize various organizations in the villages, consolidate the gains already obtained by the masses, and welcome the large-scale production campaign. Activists and mass leaders in the land reform movement should participate in the leadership of various organizations for large-scale production. In border areas, special attention should be paid to reorganizing and developing the militia. Fourth, promptly carry out various spring plowing preparation works, focusing on the preparation of agricultural tools and manure.

    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Seventeenth Dispatch] The Changzi County Committee recently summarized the eighty-day mass movement. In the county's four hundred and eighty-three natural villages, four hundred and seventeen have realized "land to the tiller," and the remaining sixty-six are in the process of distributing fruit, burning old contracts and establishing new ones, and resolving disputes among farmers. This movement has truly united more than 90% of the peasants in the countryside to participate in the struggle. As a result, the number of members of the village peasant association has increased from 25,300 to 66,167. Valuable experience has been created in this regard. At the beginning of the movement last year, emphasis was placed on uniting middle peasants, and special middle peasant conferences were held to allow middle peasants to voice their grievances and absorb them into the struggle. Disputes between middle and poor peasants were resolved by "speaking reason rather than rice" and using the method of "untying knots and speaking minds." In addition, in strengthening the peasant forces, large numbers of women were absorbed into the struggle.

　　太岳四地委指示各县
    深入小村贯彻复查确定地权准备生产
    【本报太岳十八日电】四地委日前指示各县，继续贯彻土地改革，及时转入准备今年大生产运动。略谓：全区七个县王屋、士敏、晋城、高平四县，均于元月完成土地改革；阳城、济源、垣曲亦将于本月底完成，但是现仍存在着几个问题：一、运动不平衡，已结束运动的县份，仍遗漏下许多小庄。二、个别县侵犯了中农利益，至今未作解决。三、有些村庄旧存果实仍未完全分给群众。四、有些村庄土地已分配，但地权尚未确定。因此必须继续进行复查，并及时开展大生产运动之准备工作。第一、领导上立即克服松懈情绪，纠正忽视小村庄的现象。第二、进行复查：甲、果实分配是否合理，有无遗漏下的封建尾巴？乙、对中农政策执行怎样，是否赔偿了中农的损失？丙、是否彻底清查了旧存果实，干部积极分子是否退出多得果实？丁、确定地权，划界认清立新契。第三、整理村中各种组织，巩固群众已得果实，迎接大生产运动，土地改革运动中的积极分子与群众领袖应参加各种组织领导大生产。边沿区特别注意整理与发展民兵。第四、及时进行春耕各种准备工作，以农具粪土的准备为中心。
    【本报太岳十七日电】长子县委会于日前总结八十天群运，全县四百八十三个自然村，已有四百一十七个实现了耕者有其田，其余六十六个正在分配果实，或焚旧契立新契与解决农民间的纠纷问题。这次运动真正团结了农村中百分之九十以上的农民参加斗争，因此村农会会员能由二万五千三百，增至六万六千一百六十七人。在这方面创造了宝贵的经验。去年运动开始强调团结中农并专门召开中农会议让中农诉苦，吸收中农参加斗争，对中贫农间的纠纷用解圪瘩讲心思办法来解决，“说理不动米”。此外在壮大农民力量中，吸收了广大妇女参加了斗争。
