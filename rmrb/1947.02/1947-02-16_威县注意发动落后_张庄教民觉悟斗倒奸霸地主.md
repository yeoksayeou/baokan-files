(Jinan, Hebei, February 14th) In Wei County's rent reduction movement, the backward village of Beizhang Village was successfully opened up. In this village of over a hundred households, only Zhang Jiusheng's family did not practice Catholicism. Ten landlord families monopolized more than one-third of the village's land, and village affairs had always been controlled by them. The church's chairman was also manipulated by the landlords. In addition to being ruled by feudal landlords, the masses were also blinded by church superstition, and had long remained "backward." Government orders could not be effectively implemented. We couldn't even recruit students when we established a school, because the children were all learning the Bible in the church. When district staff went, no one paid attention. During this rent reduction, the cadres discovered a folk song compiled by Er Mazi: "Zhang Village, fate is not strong, charitable organizations have changed their appearance, landlords hide things in the church, landlords open flour mills in the school..." All the peasants could sing this folk song, and the cadres seized on this song to enlighten the poor peasants. At a grievance meeting, some said: "The powerful people in Beizhang Village are all rich people," and others said: "Don't even think about becoming the chairman; we're not even good enough to talk to the priests." Peasant Zhang Lange said: "The priests preach charity, but I think it's fake. Otherwise, why would the priest take my two lacquered stools and a lacquered official chair after I ate two catties of sorghum from the church during the famine year?" Everyone clamored, saying: "No wonder the priest said in the church as soon as he heard that our village was going to start a struggle: 'Don't listen to the devil's deception; destroying the Eucharist will prevent you from going to heaven.' It turns out he is a big exploiter." "Father Pan's loans always carry a 5% interest rate. Poor people can't live, but the priest lies and says: 'Everything is predestined by God. As long as you endure, you will suffer some hardships in this life, and you will go to heaven in the next life.'" After full deliberation, the majority of the masses in Beizhang Village awakened, and the landlords and bullies were overthrown. The peasants were distributed land and houses, and the utensils that the church had seized from the peasants during the famine years were returned to them. The masses reasoned with Father Pan. The director of the Nangong Church sent people to apologize to the masses and promised that the priest would no longer cover up for the landlords, and the masses calmed down. Many people are no longer willing to go to church to chant scriptures, saying: "God is deceiving people; Chairman Mao is our savior, and the liberated area is our paradise."

　　威县注意发动落后
    张庄教民觉悟
    斗倒奸霸地主
    【本报冀南十四日电】威县查减运动中，攻开落后村北张庄。该村百多户，只有张久胜家一户不奉天主教，十户地主垄断着全村三分之一以上的土地，村政一向为他们所把持，教堂的会长，也受地主们操纵，群众除受封建地主的统治外，加上教会迷信的蒙蔽，长期停于“落后”。政令不能很好推行。我们成立学校也招不到学生，因儿童们都在堂里学圣经。区工作人员去，也没人理。这次查减，干部发现了二麻子编的歌谣：“张家庄，命不强，慈善机关改了样，教堂里地主藏东西，学校里地主开粉房……”这歌谣农民都会唱，干部就抓紧这歌谣，在贫苦农民中进行了启发，在一次诉苦会上，有的说：“北张庄称劲的都是富人”，有的说：“别说咱不能当会长，连给神甫说话也够不上”农民张兰阁说：“神甫讲慈悲，我看是假的，不然为什么灾荒年我吃了堂里二斤高粮，神甫硬要我的两条漆凳和一张漆官椅”。大家一阵喧嚷说：“怪不得神甫一听咱村要起斗争，就在堂里讲：‘别听魔鬼的迷惑，破坏了圣体不能上天堂。’原来他就是个大剥削者。”“潘神甫放账从来都是五分利息。穷人不能活，可是神甫骗说：一切都是天主命定，只要忍耐，今生受些苦难，来生会上天堂。”经过充分的酝酿，北张庄群众大部觉悟起来，斗倒了地主、恶霸，农民分到了土地和房屋，教堂灾荒年吞并农民的用具都还了农民。群众和潘神甫讲理，南宫教堂的院长，派人来向群众道歉，并保证神甫不再替地主打掩护，群众才平下气来。很多群众不愿再进堂念经了，都说：“天主是哄人的，毛主席才是救命的恩人，解放区是咱们的天堂。”
