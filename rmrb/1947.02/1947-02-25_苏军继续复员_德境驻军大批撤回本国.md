　　Soviet Army Continues Demobilization
    Large Numbers of Troops Stationed in Germany Withdrawn to Their Homeland
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] TASS reports: Soldiers being demobilized in accordance with the order issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on February 5th of last year will begin arriving in Moscow, the Soviet capital, in early March, and the people are preparing a warm welcome for them. Of the soldiers demobilized in the past, 98.3 percent have returned to work in factories, manufacturing plants, and offices, and many have entered schools. According to materials from the Soviet Minister of Higher Education, Kaftanov, there are currently 100,000 veterans in Soviet institutions of higher education. This year alone, graduate schools and universities have enrolled 45,000 veterans. The new demobilization will enable even more veterans to enter schools for advanced studies, where they will receive higher allowances and higher food rations. Preparatory courses have been established for veterans in institutions of higher education in five major cities, with tuition waived and stipends provided to students. The number of books to be published this year will be double that of last year, with geographical books increasing eighty-fivefold and agricultural and literary books increasing two and a half times.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] United Press reports that the Soviet Union in Germany has been redeploying for five months, withdrawing strong detachments back to the country. Currently, the Soviet occupation forces in Germany number less than 200,000, equal to the number of American occupation forces. Soviet troops in Austria have also been reduced by half recently, leaving only about 30,000.
