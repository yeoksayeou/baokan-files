[Dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] by this newspaper, 9th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops, in coordination with the Yellow River flood, "mopped up" residents along the river in Dongyuan, creating an unprecedented bloodbath. When the Yellow River flood reached the area around Naoliji in southwestern Dongyuan, on the 16th day of the twelfth lunar month, a battalion of the 29th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's army stationed in Dongming City, along with more than 600 Chiang Kai-shek puppet Home Return Corps members, went to Jiaolou to "mop up." On that day, Jiaolou was holding a grand fair, and tens of thousands of people from within a radius of twenty or thirty *li* came to attend the fair to buy goods for the New Year. Chiang Kai-shek's troops suddenly surrounded Jiaolou from three directions and bombarded it with artillery fire. Flesh and blood flew everywhere in the village, goods were scattered all over the ground, and women and children were trampled miserably, which was extremely tragic. Those who escaped had just reached Lüzhuang Xiaoshikou when the enemy concentrated heavy and light machine-gun fire, and the masses fell to the ground one after another. Afterwards, there were more than 80 people lying in pools of blood. Cui Fenglin, a silversmith from Liulou, was shot in the head and covered in blood. Cui's son's stomach was blown open, and his intestines flowed out. The clothes of a sugar-blower from Xiaopoulou caught fire from the explosion, and the body was charred beyond recognition. A bowstring seller from Hehuizi Village had both thighs completely severed by the blast, and his head was a bloody mess from the bullet; an old woman with white hair and three children were unable to move the body and wept bitterly while embracing each other. Casualties included 11 from Liuguanying, 3 from Suji, 4 from Majunying, and almost every village within a radius of dozens of villages had casualties. People from various villages rushed to Jiaolou, sons looking for fathers, wives looking for husbands, old mothers looking for sons, crying and running, wailing all over the fields. Such a cruel massacre is unprecedented in Dongyuan. Er Tietou from Liuzhuang, whose leg was injured while attending the fair, said: "Old Chiang is determined not to let us live, and we cannot wait to die. When I recover, I will fight him!"

[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th] Several American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes twice raided San'anhe in Fuyu County, northern Jilin, on the 11th and 19th of last month, strafing the people who were busy preparing for the New Year fair at low altitude, killing and wounding more than 70 peaceful residents. The local people witnessed the tragedy and were extremely indignant. A condemnation meeting of more than 2,000 people was held on the 2nd of this month to oppose the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek air force and vowed to support the front line to kill the enemy and avenge their compatriots.
