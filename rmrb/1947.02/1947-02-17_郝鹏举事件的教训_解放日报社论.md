　　The Lesson of the Hao Pengju Incident
　　_Liberation Daily_ Editorial

　　Hao Pengju, who betrayed his promise to "withdraw from the civil war and support democracy" and abandoned the glorious title of "Central China Democratic Allied Army" to become a pawn of Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Linyi, was captured by the Shandong People's Liberation Army on the 7th. Only eleven days passed from his betrayal to his capture.

　　On January 9th of last year, Hao Pengju expressed his willingness to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and established the Democratic Allied Army. The attitude of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas towards him could not have been more friendly; the treatment of his troops by the Liberated Area government was even better than that of the People's Liberation Army. This situation led Hao Pengju, in his "Resolution to Launch a Self-Defense War Against the Reactionaries" written last summer, and in his telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on January 9th of this year, to admit: "We (Hao's troops) received warm love and help from the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, especially when they often sent us provisions and firewood from one or two hundred _li_ away, which made us extremely grateful and excited." "During this period, we were grateful and excited that the democratic government and the CCP East China Bureau provided generous material supplies to our army, showed brotherly love in spirit, and helped our army to progress and improve into a people's armed force, and all the officers and men were grateful and excited."

　　The road ahead of Hao Pengju was very clear: if he kept his promise and opposed the civil war and supported democracy together with the people, his future would be bright; if he broke his promise and became a running dog of the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek, he would inevitably be discriminated against and sacrificed by Chiang Kai-shek, and would inevitably be destroyed.

　　In the entire six months of the patriotic self-defense war, Hao Pengju, with over 10,000 troops, did not fight and did not contribute to the people, but the people still forgave him. In December of last year, when Hao Pengju's collusion with the Chiang army became increasingly evident, the People's Liberation Army once again told him: we advocate freedom to come and go and will not force anyone, but we hope that he will not participate in the civil war and will not attack the Liberated Areas, increasing the suffering of the people. Under these conditions, the People's Liberation Army would also not attack him. The People's Liberation Army can be said to have done its utmost for Hao Pengju.

　　However, on January 27th, Hao Pengju wanted to "return the army to the state." What does "return the army to the state" mean? It clearly meant surrendering to the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek whom Hao Pengju had vehemently denounced, and it clearly meant that he himself wanted to be a reactionary. Sure enough, after surrendering to Chiang, Chiang Kai-shek neither allowed Hao's troops to enter Haizhou nor placed them in an isolated position on a flank of the front line. He himself was actually willing to be a vanguard in attacking the people, and he actively attacked the Liberated Areas in this large-scale attack on southern Shandong by the Chiang army, willing to be Chiang Kai-shek's sacrificial lamb. As a result, the people were able to punish the traitor, and Hao Pengju received his due end.

　　The People's Liberation Army is clear about Hao Pengju's history. Hao Pengju is a well-known fickle figure among Chinese warlords, a cunning and treacherous feudal warlord with ambition, and a national sinner who has served as a traitor. Although this is the case, the People's Liberation Army, with the aim of treating people with kindness, hoped that when he announced his "withdrawal from the civil war and support for democracy" from Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary camp, he could truly turn over a new leaf and become a good person, transform his army into an army of the people, and do some good things for the people of our country. For this purpose, it did not hesitate to wait for his awakening for a long time. The People's Liberation Army is not afraid of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, and of course even less afraid of Hao Pengju. The People's Liberation Army also has no demands on Hao Pengju. The reason why we did our utmost was entirely out of the desire to reduce the suffering of the people.

　　But history proves that feudal warlords like Hao Pengju never turn over a new leaf. For such feudal warlords, the gun is their personal property, and all officers and soldiers are their big and small slaves. Such feudal warlords do not understand democracy at all, are not grateful for the kindness given to them by the people, and have no feelings for the people; the purpose of all their actions, including beautiful and even "revolutionary" rhetoric, is only to be opportunistic! Such feudal warlords only have feelings for imperialism and the big landlords, big compradors, and big bourgeoisie. Although they know that Chiang Kai-shek discriminates against them and wants to sacrifice them, and will not give them any good future, at a critical juncture, they will never be willing to contribute to the people, but they will definitely be willing to be Chiang Kai-shek's vanguard and sacrificial lamb. There is a group of people like Hao Pengju among the feudal warlords in China. He started his career by being fickle and by colluding with others. One of them is Zhang Lanfeng, who was recently captured. Hao Pengju, Zhang Lanfeng, and other warlords of this ilk can be puppet troops when the Japanese come, they can talk about "democracy" when the People's Liberation Army comes, and they can "return the army to the state" when Chiang Kai-shek comes, but they will never do anything for the people, not even lift a finger. They only do things for their own promotion and wealth, and for exploiting and oppressing the people. If you want to regard such an army as a democratic army, then the lessons are not far away, look at Hao and Zhang!

　　What is a people's army? What is a democratic army? How can an old army of feudal warlords be transformed into a people's army and a democratic army?

　　Obviously, simply changing the name and simply announcing an uprising cannot transform an army into a people's army and a democratic army.

　　Transforming an old feudal army into a people's army requires a painful, fierce, and thorough revolutionary process. The content of this revolution is: first, overthrow the warlord system of officers oppressing soldiers and superiors oppressing subordinates, and implement a new system, that is, a system of unity between officers and soldiers. Second, overthrow the old system of the army and implement a new system, that is, a system of unity between the army and the people, that is, a system of the army serving the people. This service is not only verbal, but most importantly, actual actions to fight for independence, peace, and democracy, and it must be thoroughly implemented in daily life, serving the people in everything, such as strictly implementing support the government and cherish the people and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Only after such a thorough and relentless great revolution and great turnaround can the old army possibly become a new army, a people's army and a democratic army. If this revolution is not carried out, then the political consciousness of the soldiers and the masses cannot be raised, and if the political consciousness of the soldiers is not raised and the soldiers cannot become the masters of the army, then even if a few officers originally wanted to make their army a people's army, it would be of no avail. If this revolution is not carried out or is not carried out thoroughly, this army cannot possibly gain support, cannot possibly wage a people's war, cannot possibly defeat a strong enemy with inferior weapons, and cannot possibly apply the strategy and tactics of a people's army. On the contrary, an army that has not undergone such a thorough revolution, no matter what it is called in name, is still a feudal army in essence, and even if it does not show it for a while, it will reveal its true colors at a critical juncture. This is an unfailing truth that has been proven repeatedly in the revolutionary movement for more than 20 years.

　　There are many truly patriotic military personnel in our country. Their most important task is to understand the above-mentioned truth and truly resolve to transform their army with unyielding perseverance. The Chinese people urgently need a truly people's own army, that is, a people's army or a democratic army, for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland, but only in the above-mentioned reform can a new army be produced from the old army. This reform is possible, but there must be determination. This reform can succeed, because the existing People's Liberation Army already serves as an example. But if there is no such determination, if one is afraid of the painful, fierce, and thorough revolutionary process, then the lesson of the Hao Pengju incident will not have been understood by us.

　　郝鹏举事件的教训
    解放日报社论
    背叛自己“退出内战拥护民主”的诺言、抛弃“华中民主联军”的光荣称号，当蒋介石进攻临沂的走卒的郝鹏举，已于七日被山东人民解放军俘获。从他背叛到被俘前后仅十一天。
    去年一月九日，郝鹏举表示愿意与人民解放军合作，成立了民主联军，解放区军民对他的态度是再友好也没有了；解放区政府对于该部的待遇，比对人民解放军还要优厚，也是再好也没有的了。这种情形，使郝鹏举在去年夏天所写的“决向反动派展开自卫战”，及今年一月九日致毛主席与朱总司令的电文中，也不能不承认：“我们（郝部）在解放区曾得到军民的热烈爱护与帮助，尤其他们常从一、二百里外送给我们给养、柴草，真是使我们万分感激与兴奋”。“在此期间，承蒙民主政府及中共华东局对本军在物质上予以优厚之供给，在精神上予以兄弟之爱护，并协助本军进步，改善成为人民武装，全军将士莫不感激兴奋”。
    放在郝鹏举面前的道路是很明白的：如果他实践诺言，与人民一起反对内战拥护民主，他的前途是光明的；如果他背弃诺言，做卖国贼独裁者蒋介石的走卒，则势必遭蒋介石的歧视与牺牲，势必归于消灭。
    在整整半年的爱国自卫战争中，郝鹏举拥兵万余未曾作战，不为人民出力，人民仍是原谅他。去年十二月间，郝鹏举与蒋军的勾结日益显著，人民解放军又曾告诉他：我们是主张来去自由的，必不相强，但是希望他不要参加内战，不要向解放区进攻，加重人民的痛苦。在此条件下，人民解放军亦可不向他进攻。人民解放军对于郝鹏举可算做到仁至义尽了。
    但是，一月二十七日郝鹏举要“还军于国”了，什么叫做“还军于国”？那明明白白就是投向郝鹏举所痛骂过的反动派蒋介石，明明白白就是自己想反动。果然，投蒋之后，蒋介石既不让郝部开入海州，又把它放在第一线上一个侧翼的孤立地位，他自己居然也愿意做进攻人民的前锋队，并在此次蒋军向鲁南大进攻中积极向解放区进攻，愿意做蒋介石的牺牲品。结果人民办到了惩罚叛逆，郝鹏举也得到了应有的下场。
    人民解放军是清楚郝鹏举的历史的。郝鹏举是中国军阀中著名的反复无常的一个，是具有野心的奸猾狡诈的封建军阀，是当过汉奸的民族罪人。虽然这样，但是人民解放军以与人为善的宗旨，当他由蒋介石反动营垒中宣布“退出内战拥护民主”之际，总希望他真能够回心向善做个好人，将其军队改造成为人民的军队，为我国人民做些好事。为此目的，并不惜长期等待其觉悟，人民解放军决不畏惧美国帝国主义和蒋介石，当然更不畏惧什么郝鹏举，人民解放军也无所求于郝鹏举。我们所以做得仁至义尽，全是因为从减少人民痛苦的要求出发的。
    可是历史证明，郝鹏举这样的封建军阀是从不回心向善的，对于这种封建军阀，枪杆子就是他的个人私有财产，全体官兵都是他的大奴隶和小奴隶。这种封建军阀根本不懂什么民主，对于人民给他的恩典是毫不感激的，对于人民是毫无感情的；他的一切作为，包括漂亮的以至“革命”的辞令在内，目的仅在投机取巧！这种封建军阀只和帝国主义和大地主、大买办、大资产阶级是有感情的，虽然明知蒋介石歧视他，要牺牲他，决不会给他什么好的前途，然而在紧急关头，他决不肯替人民出力，却一定愿意替蒋介石当马前卒，当牺牲品。中国的封建军阀里是有一批像郝鹏举这样的人的，他本就靠翻云覆雨起家，靠勾勾搭搭起家，其中之一就是最近就俘的张岚峰。郝鹏举、张岚峰这一流军阀，日本人来了可以当伪军，人民解放军来了可以讲“民主”，蒋介石来了可以“还军于国”，但是他们决不为人民拔一根毛、做一点事。他们只为自己的升官发财做事，为剥削人民压迫人民做事。如果要以这种军队当作民主军队，那末殷鉴不远，请看郝、张！
    什么叫做人民军队，什么叫做民主军队，从封建军阀的旧军队要怎样才能变为人民军队与民主军队？
    很明显的，光光换个名称，光光宣布起义，这支军队是不能变为人民军队与民主军队的。
    从封建的旧军队变为人民的军队，要经过痛苦的激烈的脱胎换骨的革命过程。这个革命的内容，就是：第一、打倒官长压迫士兵，上级压迫下级的军阀制度，实行一个新制度，即是官兵一致的制度。第二、打倒军队旧制度，实行一种新制度，即是军民一致的制度，即是军队为人民服务的制度，这种服务不但是口头上的，而且最重要的是实际行动上为独立和平民主而作战，而且要彻底贯彻到在日常生活上，事事处处为老百姓服务，如像极其严格的实行拥政爱民与三大纪律八项注意。要有这样一个彻底的不留情的大革命大翻身之后，然后旧军队才有可能变成新军队，变成人民军队与民主军队。这种革命如果没有进行，那末士兵群众的政治觉悟就不能提高，而如果士兵的政治觉悟不提高，士兵不能成为军队的主人，那末即使有几个官长原想使它的军队成为人民军队，也是无济于事。如果没有进行这种革命或者进行得不彻底，这支军队就没有可能得到拥护，就没有可能进行人民战争，就没有可能以劣势武器战胜强敌，就没有可能应用人民军队的战略战术。相反的，没有经过这种彻底革命的军队，不管名义上叫什么，实质上仍旧是封建军队，即使一时显不出来，在紧急关头就会显出原形。这乃是二十余年来革命运动中屡试不爽的真理。
    我国是有许多真心爱国的军人的，他们的最严重的任务是懂得上述的真理，而真正的下决心以百折不挠的毅力来改造自己的军队。中国人民为了祖国的独立和平民主，是急需有真正人民自己的军队，即人民军队或民主军队的，但是惟有在上述的那种改革之中，才能从旧军队中产生出新军队来。这里改革乃是可能的，但是必须有决心，这种改革可以成功，因为已有现有的人民解放军作为榜样了。但是如果没有这个决心，如果害怕痛苦的激烈的脱胎换骨的革命过程，那末郝鹏举事件的教训，就没有被我们领会。
