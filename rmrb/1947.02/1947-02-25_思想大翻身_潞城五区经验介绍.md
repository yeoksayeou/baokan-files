　　Ideological Turnaround
    Introduction to the Experiences of the Fifth District of Lucheng
    Liu Cun
    In the fifteen months of the anti-traitor, rent reduction, and land investigation movement in the Fifth District of Lucheng, because the repeated suffering and ideological education in action were only piecemeal, the peasants did not completely turn over ideologically. Therefore, the leadership put forward the slogan of ideological turnaround and carried out systematic ideological education. Several experiences were gained in the movement:
  (1) Break all kinds of hindering thoughts and form a movement of pouring out grievances.
    Pouring out grievances is an old experience, but it is a difficult problem to pour out grievances thoroughly and form a movement, because there are all kinds of hindering thoughts. The first is the "shameful thought." Shi Quanbao, a public security officer in Chen Village, used to beg for food. He thought that now that he is a cadre, it is embarrassing to mention begging in the past. He didn't pour out his grievances himself, but only chased after the masses to pour out their grievances. The masses saw that he begged for food and didn't pour out their grievances, of course they didn't pour out their grievances either. To solve this thought, we proposed: "Shameful is to shame the people of the old society, to shame the landlords, not to shame ourselves." In this way, in a turnaround ideological group in Zhang Village, five hired laborers all poured out that the landlord's daughters-in-law and daughters used their bodies to seduce them at night to exchange for their hard work day and night. After they exposed this "double exploitation," they poured out all the pain the landlord gave them. Cheng Xi told about the things he had hidden for the landlord, and ideologically separated from the landlord. The second is "words are as thin as water after saying them three times." We used the methods of "breaking the pain" and "dismantling the pain" and concrete facts, and proposed "the more you pour out your grievances, the more you have, the more you break it, the more flavorful it becomes." The third is "forgotten the pain of scabies that have fallen off," and the thought of "it's useless to say or not to say." We also used facts and proposed "if you don't pour out your grievances thoroughly, you won't turn over" to break it.
    Only by breaking the above three kinds of hindering thoughts can a large-scale movement be formed. Li Cungou, led by Liang Madou, the turnaround hero of Taihang, formed a movement before the autumn. They poured out their grievances for three days and three nights. The women's eyes were red, their voices were hoarse, and the old men and women "thought of each other when they inserted their roots." Four of them fainted from pouring out their grievances. Everyone was unwilling to go back to eat. When eating, they brought out casseroles to pour out their grievances. Many families of women combined their stoves to participate in the meeting.
  (2) "Crack" the pain, and link the pain in series.
    Pouring out the pain does not mean awakening. It is necessary to use the views of the new society (class analysis method) to "crack" the pain and "dismantle" it. First "crack" the pain, and then link the pain in series, so as to achieve "ideological turnaround."
    The old Rongze of Li Cungou was originally from Pingshun. His father smoked opium and smoked away a family fortune. He sold his mother. He fled to Licheng to graze cattle and reclaimed more than 20 mu of land after more than ten years. His "father who lost his family fortune gave it to him." He fled to Li Cungou, couldn't pay the rent and sold his wife. In the famine year, his brother worked for the landlord and starved to death. Although he hated the landlord, he also hated his "father who lost his family fortune." When his father was dying, old Rongze said: "If you die, no one will lose my family fortune." The people in the group guided him to think about how his father started smoking opium? He remembered that it was his clansman who taught him. The clansman was a landlord and had a good relationship with his father. When he lost his family fortune, he sold five mu of the best land to him. Others guided him a little bit, "Are the landlord and your father really good or pretending to be good?" Old Rongze remembered that his five mu of land yielded two seasons a year and could produce twenty stone of grain. When the landlord wanted to buy these five mu of land, his father slapped the landlord twice. His father was waiting to go to court, but the landlord changed his attitude and went to his house every day with a wine pot and a lamp to smoke opium, and became good friends with his father, inducing his father to become addicted to opium, lose his family fortune, and sell his mother, and the five mu of good land was obtained by the landlord. So he "cracked" it open. Old Rongze cried and said, "The old rich man plotted to get my five mu of land and came up with a plan to destroy my whole family." He attributed all his lifelong pain to the landlord. He realized that his father had been fooled, and he didn't hate his father anymore. He linked his lifelong pain in series: the Pingshun landlord, the Licheng landlord, the Li Cungou landlord, and the Zhang Village landlord, each of whom gave him a lot of pain. He realized that the landlords in the world are all black, and the peasants are oppressed everywhere, and the peasants in the world are equally bitter. He also compared the unity after liberation, fighting down Wang Maolin, getting a house, getting land, and also getting a wife. He said: "I am fifty-three years old. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I wouldn't have thought of living these last two days. I can climb for a day, and I want to serve the masses for a day." In this way, old Rongze woke up from history.
    In the process of cracking and linking in series, many peasants' minds have undergone a great turnaround. Many people have turned from hating dog legs to hating landlords, from blaming their parents to hating the old society. Everyone has found their opponent, seen through the old society, and their minds have been "enlightened." They realized that the system and thoughts of the old society were like magic tricks that "caught tigers."
  (3) Summarize the lifelong turnaround requirements and the experience of fighting against the landlord.
    A peasant's life is a life of demanding a turnaround. Everyone has used various means and fighting methods. Some get up early and work hard, bury their heads in suffering and try to make a fortune, but they can't stand the disasters and illnesses, and marriages and funerals. Some curry favor with the landlord, lick their relatives, and want the landlord to give them a hand, but ten out of ten are disappointed. Individuals who have awakened fight against the landlord, and those who are more awakened "form a group" and fight against the landlord. The biggest and most profound one is still after liberation. From the peasants' own fighting experience, we can summarize the importance of "unity, leadership, and armed forces," and improve their unity consciousness, organizational consciousness, and armed consciousness from their personal experience.
    Yin Ercheng, the political director of Nanjin, recalled his lifelong experience of fighting against the landlord: "You deceive my belly, and I deceive your land." When working hard, they used three hoes. Once when they were harvesting wheat and reclaiming wasteland, they ate jade noodles and @ @. They scattered wheat everywhere, and the family members who picked up wheat worked together to make noodles. He planted vegetable gardens for the landlord and discussed with several vegetable growers to align the rows, sell more and hand in less, and draw money from it. He was a long-term worker for the landlord and removed jade ling, buried it in the ground, and asked his family to dig it up. He thought of so many ways, wanting to get two mu of land to buy an old ox, but he never achieved it. After liberation, he united to fight and turned over, and he had a house, land, and a wife. When he woke up and saw a good house, he had the energy to work. Wang Lin recalled that because the landlord forcibly cut down his old locust tree, he organized more than 100 people to fight against the landlord, and four people were knocked down, resulting in failure. Everyone realized from their own experience: "Before, there was not much leadership, the unity was not tight, and the government was also theirs, so we failed; after liberation, we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us, and it is our world, so we turned over."
    The ideological turnaround of the peasants is rapidly changing the old ideas that may be used by landlords and special agents to counterattack, changing the remaining old class relations and social relations based on the old ideas, and completely liberating the peasants' minds.

　　思想大翻身
    潞城五区经验介绍
    柳村
    潞城五区十五个月反奸减租查田运动中，由于反复诉苦和行动中的思想教育只是片断的，以致农民在思想上没有完全翻了身。因此领导上提出思想大翻身的口号，进行系统的思想教育。在运动中获得几点经验：
  （一）打破各种各样的阻碍思想把诉苦形成运动
    诉苦是个老经验，但诉透苦，形成运动却是一个难题，因为有各种各样的阻碍思想，首先是“丢人思想”，陈村公安员史全保要过饭，他认为今天当了干部，提起过去要饭怪丢人的，自己不诉，光追群众诉，群众看见他要饭还不诉，当然也不诉，解决这思想，我们提出：“丢人是丢旧社会的人，丢地主的人，不是丢自己的人”。这样张庄一个翻思想小组有五个雇工却都诉出地主家的媳妇闺女黑夜用肉体勾引他们，来换取他们白天起早搭黑狠劳动。他们揭发了这种“两头剥削”之后，把地主给他们的痛苦全都诉出来。承喜把给地主隐藏的东西说出来，从思想上和地主分了家。其次是“话说三遍淡如水”，我们用“破解痛苦”“拆划痛苦”的办法和具体事实，提出“越诉苦越多，越破解越有味”。再次是“落了的疮痂忘了痛”，“说不说不顶事”思想，我们也用事实并提出“诉不透苦，翻不透身”来打破它。
    只有把以上三种阻碍思想打破，才能形成大规模的运动，太行翻身英雄梁马斗领导的李村沟，秋前就形成了运动，一口气诉了三天三夜，妇女们眼红了，嗓子号哑了，老汉老婆们“插根想起”，有四个诉得昏倒过去，大家不愿回去吃饭，吃饭时端出沙锅诉苦，许多家妇女为了参加会并了锅灶。
  （二）“破解”痛苦，连串痛苦
    诉出痛苦，不等于觉悟，必须用新社会的看法（阶级分析方法）把苦“破解”开“拆划”开，先把痛苦“破解”开，然后把痛苦连串起来，才能做到“思想大翻身”。
    李村沟的老荣则原籍是平顺人，他爹吸大烟，把一份家业吸光了，卖了他娘，他逃到黎城放牛，开荒十来年受起二十多亩地，又叫他“摔家业爹，给他了”，他逃到李村沟，交不起租卖了老婆，灾荒年兄弟给地主做活，还落了个饿死。他虽仇恨地主，但也仇恨他“摔家业爹”。他爹临死时，老荣则说：“你死了就没人摔我的家业了”。小组的人引导他想他爹是怎样吸起了大烟？他想起是他个本家教的，本家是个地主，和他爹相好，摔家业时把五亩最好的地卖给了他，别人又引导了一下“地主和你爹是真相好假相好？”老荣则想起他这五亩地一年收两季，能打二十石粮食，地主要买这五亩地，他爹打了地主两耳光，他爹等着打官司，地主却变了态度，每天拿着酒壶，提着烟灯到他家，和他爹成了相好，引诱他爹染上烟瘾，摔了家业卖了娘，五亩好地谋到地主手。于是他“破解”开了，老荣则大哭起来说：“老财谋我五亩地，生出计谋灭我全家。”他把终身痛苦都归结到地主身上，他觉悟到他爹上了当，他不仇恨他爹了。他又把一辈子痛苦连串起来：平顺地主、黎城地主、李村沟地主、张庄地主，那一个也给他许多痛苦，他觉悟到天下地主一样黑，农民到处受压迫，天下农民一样苦。他又对比了解放后团结起来，斗倒了王茂林，要房有了房，要地有了地，还娶了老婆，他说：“我五十三了，要不是毛主席我想也想不到活这末两天，我能爬动一天，要为群众服上一天务。”这样老荣则就从历史上觉悟起来。
    在破解与连串的过程中，许多农民思想来了个大翻身，许多人由仇恨狗腿翻到仇恨地主，从埋怨爹娘翻到仇恨旧社会，大家找到了对头，看穿了旧社会，思想上“开了窍”。认识到旧社会的制度与思想，像变戏法一样“捉虎”人。
  （三）总结一生翻身要求和地主斗争的经验
    农民的一生是要求翻身的一生，每个人都用了各种各样的手段和斗争方式，有的起早搭黑，埋头苦受闹发家，结果禁不起生灾闹病，婚丧大事；有的巴结地主，溜舐亲戚，想叫地主拉一把，十个有十个都失望，觉悟了的个人向地主斗争，更觉悟的“结团体”和地主斗争，最大最深刻的一次还是解放以后。从农民自己的斗争经验中，可以总结出“团结、领导、武装”的重要，从他切身经验中提高其团结自觉，组织自觉和武装自觉。
    南金政治主任尹而成回忆了他一生和地主斗争的经验：“你哄我肚皮，我哄你地皮。”打忙工三张锄，有一次割麦开荒那天吃的玉菱面、＠＠，他们几个人便丢三拉四到处洒下麦子，和拾麦的家人同心合了面。他给地主种菜园，和几个种菜把式商量好，齐了行，多卖少交，从中抽钱，他给地主打长工撇玉菱，撇下来埋到地里，叫他家里人来刨。想了多少法，想弄上二亩地买个老牛，可是始终达不到。解放后，团结起来斗争翻了身，也有了房子，也有了地了，也有了老婆了，睡觉起来一睁眼看到好房子，干工作就有劲了。王林回忆因地主强砍他大槐树，组织了一百多人和地主斗争，叫人家打倒四个，结果失败了。大家根据自己的经验认识到：“以前没多领导，团结不紧，政府又是人家的，所以失败了；解放后咱们有毛泽东共产党领导，又是咱们的天下，所以翻了身。”
    农民的思想大翻身，正迅速地改变着可能为地主特务利用借以反攻的旧思想，改变着长在旧思想基础上残余的旧的阶级关系和社会关系，使农民思想完全解放。
