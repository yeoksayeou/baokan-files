Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: The Shandong Military Region People's Armed Forces Department, based on preliminary experience in carrying out the merit citation campaign for more than two months, pointed out that the following four basic links must be grasped to develop this campaign in the future: (1) In-depth and sustained mobilization, so that the depth of mobilization is consistent with the scale of the campaign. At present, attention should be paid to the following during mobilization: A. For cadres at all levels, it should be emphasized that the merit citation campaign is a new leadership method; B. For militia self-defense mobilization, the masses should truly understand why they should achieve merits based on different regions, different objects, and different requirements. (2) Accurate reporting of merits. Any individual or group who has performed meritorious service must report the content and process of their own or the unit's meritorious service to their direct superiors in a specific and timely manner. The superior authorities must quickly investigate its authenticity, and should not make conclusions lightly based on one-sided statements. (3) Fair merit recording. Generally, the village and militia squad (or company) should be taken as the basic unit for merit recording, and a mass-based merit evaluation committee should be established to make the achievement of merits democratically recognized by the public. The following basic principles must be implemented at all levels when evaluating merits: evaluate merits based on the merits themselves, not the person; determine the rank based on the merits; give the same awards for the same merits; only offset demerits with merits, and do not reduce merits due to demerits. (4) Timely awarding of merits. After the merits are evaluated and approved by the relevant authorities, awards should be given in a timely manner, and the view that small or few merits are not worth an award should be resolutely corrected. Before the final evaluation is obtained, its deeds should be promptly reported and disseminated on blackboards, victory reports, newspapers, and merit lists.

    总结立功运动经验
    一、深入持久动员
    二、报功必须确实
    三、记功必须公平
    四、奖功必须及时          
    【新华社山东四日电】山东军区人民武装部根据两个多月开展立功运动的初步经验，指出今后发展此运动必须掌握四个基本环节：（一）深入持久的动员，使动员的深度与运动的规模保持一致。目前动员时应注意：甲、对各级干部应强调立功运动是一个新的领导方法；乙、对于民兵自卫动员应根据不同地区不同对象不同要求使群众真正了解为什么立功。（二）确实报功。凡立功之个人或团体必须将自己或单位功劳内容与经过具体及时报告直属上级，上级机关必须迅速考查其确实性，不可只听一面之词，轻下结论。（三）公平记功。一般的以村和民兵中队（或连）为记功之基本单位，并应设立群众性的评功委员会，使功劳取得民主的公认。各级在评功时必须贯彻以下的基本原则：论功不论人，按功定等，同功同奖，只可将功折罪，不可因罪减功。（四）及时奖功。功劳经有关机关评定核准后，即应及时授奖，切实纠正以为功小功少不值一奖的看法。在未获最后评定之前，其事迹应及时在黑板报、捷报、报纸以及功劳榜上迅速进行报导和传播。
