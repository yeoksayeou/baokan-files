　　[This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, February 25th] (Delayed) The People's Liberation Army proactively withdrew from Juye City on the 19th. The Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army, 45th Division, 200th Division, and 96th Division occupied the city.

　　[This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, February 24th] Chiang's 75th Division invaded northward from Jinbei and occupied our Jia City on the 21st.

　　[This dispatch from the Jilu Yu Front, February 25th] Chiang's troops invading northward from Juye City encountered a powerful counterattack from our army. On the 19th, Chiang's 96th Division occupied Juye City. On the 20th, they occupied Zaozhuang, Mazhuang, and Shazhuang, where they were met with resistance from our army. Subsequently, two regiments of Chiang's troops (five li north of Juye City), under the cover of several aircraft and tanks, launched a fierce attack northward from 7:00 AM until dusk on the 20th. Chiang's troops suffered over 300 casualties but failed to succeed, and the village remained firmly in our hands. On the same day, at Longduiji (west of Juye), Chiang's 96th Division, advancing eastward towards Wuzhuang, Bijia Hai, and Guo Jiafang, launched a fierce attack on our army's positions throughout the day. Despite air support, the above three villages remained in our army's hands until nightfall, and the enemy retreated back to the collection point. On the 21st, the 5th Army of Chiang's troops continued its northward advance along the Shatuoguo line, and encountered strong resistance from our army at Ding Guantuan and Luan Guantuan (north and northeast of Juye), inflicting several hundred casualties on the enemy, ultimately preventing them from advancing. On the same day, Chiang's troops who occupied Longduiji advanced northeastward and were blocked by our army in the Hanshiqiao, Chenlou, and Chenmiao areas. Chiang's 85th Division, advancing eastward along the Heze highway, was blocked on the 21st in the Huangji and Shatuji areas (on the Heze highway). Each advance by the above units of Chiang's troops was met with strong resistance from our army, and Chiang's troops paid a heavy price.
