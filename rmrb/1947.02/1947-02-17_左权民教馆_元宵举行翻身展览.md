Zuoquan People's Education Center
    Holds Land Reform Exhibition on the Lantern Festival

[This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] The Zuoquan County People's Education Center held a major land reform exhibition on the Lantern Festival, attracting over eight thousand visitors in two days. At the entrance, two figures depicting the contrast between the rich and the poor were displayed: a rich man wearing silk and a top hat, and a poor man dressed in rags. Li Sannv from Mu Village remarked after seeing it, "The way we used to argue with the landlord Xing Ping was exactly like this." Further along, there was a display of landlord Wen Zhimo's silk bellyband, silk quilt, and the tattered quilt that Liu Yuxiang's entire family of five from Wulihou had shared for twenty years, so dirty that it was unrecognizable and as black as coal. Zhang Sixi indignantly said, "Lao Liu, how could you cover yourself with this every day, you really have endurance!" As he said this, he remembered how he had been exploited by landlord Wang Xiuwen, and his eyes turned red. People nearby were also wiping away tears. Further along were the landlord's oversized measuring containers and loan documents, with thumbprints and affixed stamps on the accounts. The narrator explained to the audience loudly, one by one: "Poor peasant Guo Daman borrowed 100 silver dollars from landlord Wang Aibao in the city. The landlord forced him to pay 30 silver dollars in interest upfront. With no other choice, he gave the landlord his red donkey." Old man Zhuang Zewang said, "In the past, the old rich were so greedy they would only let go of your hind legs after grabbing your front legs." On the main wall were displayed comic strips of Zhang Xiaosan's land reform journey. When people saw the scenes of Zhang Xiaosan being exploited and oppressed by landlord Li Yugui, they pointed and cursed. When they saw Zhang Xiaosan obtaining land under the democratic government, his whole family eating well during the New Year, and a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging, the masses were all smiles. An old woman with missing teeth pointed and said, "Xiaosan! Under Chairman Mao's education, work hard!" On the other side of the wall were statistical charts showing the fruits obtained by the masses and the participation in the army to defend the good times. In the west courtyard were displayed weapons seized by the Eighth Route Army in the patriotic self-defense war. The narrator pointed to the items and said to the masses, "Our county has overthrown 363 landlords, and the peasants have reclaimed 28,835 mu of land. 890 young people have joined the army..." As he explained this, he asked, "Are these days good or not?" "Good!" The masses answered emphatically. "We are well off, but Chiang Kai-shek doesn't want us to be well off. What should we do?" "We will join the army, join the war, and beat the dog-day old Chiang!" (Hao Shiming)

　　左权民教馆
    元宵举行翻身展览
    【本报左权讯】左权县立民教馆，元宵节举行翻身大展览，两天参观群众达八千人以上。门口两个贫富对比的男子，富的穿着绸缎戴着大礼帽；穷的穿着破烂衣服。沐池李三女看了说：“以前咱和人家地主骂星平比，就是这样。”再走过去陈列着地主温之谟的缎暖肚、绸被子和五里堠刘玉祥全家五口人伙盖的一条盖了二十年的破被子，脏得不成样，黑得如煤。张四喜气愤愤地说：“老刘你怎么每天盖它来，真是有熬性！”说到这里，他想起他过去受地主王修文的剥削，他的眼圈发红了。旁边的人也在擦泪。再过去是地主的大斗大秤和揭钱文书、放债的账，账上按着手印，贴有印花。说明员放大嗓子给观众一件件解说：“贫农郭大蛮揭城内地主王爱保大洋一百元，人家逼他先交杂利三十元，当下没法，把自己一头红驴给了人家。”庄则王老汉说：“过去老财是捉住你前腿才敢放你后腿。”正墙上贴着张小三翻身的连环画。当人们看见张小三被地主李玉贵剥削压迫的场面时，都指指点点地骂着。看到最后张小三在民主政府下揭了石板，全家过年吃上好饭，挂着毛主席的像，群众都一个个喜笑颜开。一个脱了牙的老太婆指着说：“小三！你在毛主席教养下好好干吧！”墙那边挂着群众获得的果实和参军保卫好时光的统计图表，西院里陈列着八路军在爱国自卫战争中缴获的武器。说明员向群众指画着说：“我们全县斗垮了地主三百六十三户，农民夺回土地两万八千八百三十五亩，青年参军八百九十人………”他一面这样解说一面问：“这日月好不好？”“好！”群众斩钉截铁的回答。“咱们好，蒋介石不叫咱们好，怎么办？”“咱们参军、参战，打狗日的老蒋！”（郝世民）
