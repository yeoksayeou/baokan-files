　　Despite the stubborn obstruction of reactionary forces in Britain, the people are still striding forward.

　　The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) is growing stronger and has become a mass party with over 40,000 members and organizations throughout the country. The Party has a great influence among intellectuals, with many famous scholars and experts among its members and sympathizers, such as Professor Hyman Levy, a renowned biologist and Fellow of the Royal Society; the famous political commentator, Dutt; Britain's best historical archaeologist, Gordon Childe; the outstanding physicist and Fellow of the Royal Society, Professor Bernal; the Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, etc. The CPGB has a large number of excellent cultural figures, and the Party's publications are very popular with the people. The CPGB's newspaper, *The Daily Worker*, has become one of the most influential newspapers in Britain. Due to paper rationing, it has a circulation of 250,000 copies. It is most representative of the will of the people and can point out the direction of struggle to the people at every important moment. It is a beacon in the political life of the British people. Hyman Levy, the Dean of Canterbury, and the famous Irish playwright and revolutionary, O'Casey, are all members of the editorial board. In addition, the CPGB's publications also include the comprehensive cultural monthly *Our Time*, and the theoretical quarterly *Modern Quarterly*. Works on politics, economics, philosophy, and natural sciences are widely sold and have a great influence. *Labour Monthly* represents the Central Committee's guidance for the workers' movement.

　　The CPGB's influence in the trade unions is growing. The most powerful trade unions, such as the Miners' Federation and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, are under its leadership. Although the CPGB's request to join the Labour Party has been sabotaged by reactionary elements in the upper echelons of the Labour Party, more and more Labour Party grassroots welcome the CPGB's participation, and the number of votes in favor has been steadily increasing in several votes.

　　Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution and the oldest industrial country. Socialist thought has a long history in Britain, and the British people generally demand progressive politics. The reason why the Labour Party was elected is because they proclaimed a progressive program and policies. However, the leadership of the Labour Party is manipulated by social democratic elements such as Bevan and Morrison. Their progressive program is only for obtaining political power and they are not prepared to truly implement it. To make the Labour government fulfill its promises, it is necessary to organize the people to wage unremitting struggle against it. Past facts have shown that the CPGB has played a central role in this struggle, and they have always stood firmly on the side of the people. In the past year or so, Britain has realized the nationalization of the Bank of England and the nationalization of all coal mines. In terms of social undertakings, universal social insurance and a national health system are about to be implemented. Although there is some resistance from aristocratic workers and capitalists, they cannot prevent the universal demands of the people. Today, the issue of nationalizing the steel industry has been put on the agenda. The steel industry is the best-organized industry in Britain, and the big capitalists are absolutely unwilling to give up this strong fortress. They are uniting with the reactionary factions of the Conservative Party and the Labour Party to prevent the implementation of this plan. The CPGB is organizing forces to carry out the struggle. The construction of housing is also the most pressing issue in Britain today. During the war, millions of houses in Britain were destroyed, and many people were displaced. The Labour government promised to build three million houses within a few years, but only a small portion has been completed. The CPGB and the British people are fighting the Labour government for this.

　　In addition to fighting for democracy and improving people's livelihoods, the current struggle of the CPGB and the British people also urges the government to adopt a progressive foreign policy. Strengthen Anglo-Soviet friendship, improve diplomacy with new democratic countries, support the Chinese democratic movement, no longer be the tail of American imperialism, and withdraw foreign troops. Because Britain is an exporting country, to prosper the British economy and improve the people's lives, it is necessary to restore exports. This requires a consolidated peace.

　　Despite the fact that the reactionary elements in the upper echelons of the Labour Party have been working hand in hand with the Conservative Party and abandoning their own program, the British people, under the leadership of the CPGB, are resolutely fighting them. A year ago, the CPGB helped the Labour Party get elected with great effort. Today, they believe that they also have the power to change the Labour Party's current erroneous policies.

　　英共与英国人民
    在英国虽有反动势力顽强的阻挠，人民仍是大踏步地前进着。
    英国共产党日益壮大起来，已成为群众性的大党，拥有四万以上的党员，组织遍于全国。党在知识分子中影响极大，党员与同类分子中有许多著名的学者和专家，如名生物学家皇家学会会员海登教授，名政论家杜德，英国最好的历史考古学家苟敦柴德，出色的物理学家皇家学会会员贝尔诺勒教授，坎特伯里大主教约翰森等。英共拥有大批优秀的文化人，党的出版物极受人民的欢迎。英共机关报《工人日报》已成为英国最有影响的报纸之一，因受纸张配给的限制，发行二十五万份。它最能代表人民的意志，在每一个重要时期都能给人民指出斗争的方向，是英国人民政治生活中的灯塔。海登、坎特伯里大主教、爱尔兰名戏剧家和革命家殴卡西都是编辑委员。此外，英共出版物还有综合性的文化月刊《我们的时代》，及理论性的《近代》三月刊等。关于政治、经济、哲学及自然科学各方面的论著，销行极广，影响极大。《劳动月刊》代表中央对于职工运动的指导。
    英共在职工会中的影响日益增强。最有势力的职工会如矿工联合会、工程师联合会，即在其领导之下。英共加入工党的要求虽被工党上层反动分子所破坏，但工党下层群众欢迎英共参加的却日益增多，几次表决赞成票一直是递增的。
    英国是工业革命的策源地，是最老的工业国，社会主义思想在英国有了悠久的历史，英国人民普遍地要求进步的政治。工党之所以能当选，就是因为他们标榜了进步的纲领和政策。可是工党的领导机关是操纵在社会民主分子贝文、摩里逊之流的手里。他们的进步纲领只是为了获取政权，并不准备真正实现。要想使工党政府履行它的诺言，还需要组织人民向他做不懈的斗争。过去的事实说明：在这种斗争中，英共是起了核心作用，他们始终是坚定不移的站在人民的立场上。一年多来，英国已经实现了英格兰银行的国有和全国煤矿的国有。社会事业方面，普遍的社会保险及全国保健制度，即将付出实行，虽然有一些贵族工人、资本家的反抗，但他们终不能阻止人民的普遍要求。今天钢铁工业国有化的问题，已经提上了议事日程。钢铁工业是英国组织得最好的工业，大资本家们绝不情愿放弃这一强固的堡垒，他们正联合保守党和工党的反动派来阻止这一计划的执行。英共正在组织力量进行斗争。住宅的建筑也是当前英国最迫切的问题，战争中英伦有上百万的房屋被破坏了，许多人流落在街头，工党政府曾答应在几年内建筑住宅三百万所，可是只完成了一小部分。英共和英国人民正为此而与工党政府斗争。
    英共与英国人民当前的斗争，除了争取民主、改善民生外，还督促政府采取进步的外交政策。加强英苏友谊，改善对新民主国家外交，支持中国民主运动，不再做美帝国主义尾巴和撤回国外驻军、因为英国是出口国家，要想繁荣英国的经济，改善人民的生活，就必须恢复出口。这样就需要巩固的和平。
    尽管工党上层的反动分子一直与保守党携手，背弃了自己的纲领，而英国人民在英共领导下与他们坚决的斗争。一年前英共以极大的努力帮助了工党当选，今天他们相信也有力量改变工党现行的错误政策。
