　　Landlords Exploiting Loopholes Due to Unclear Class Divisions
    Wangwu Conducts In-Depth Investigation
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] During the land reform review in Wangwu, feudal remnants were discovered again. Landlords in villages such as Tieshan, Kancun, and Bei Li'ao escaped struggle by conducting sham liquidations. Throughout the county, except for one part of the Third District, land rights were generally not determined in villages, and new contracts were not established. The reasons for this are: (1) Only looking at the surface of the problem, each village completed its tasks before the Lunar New Year, conducting rushed struggles and distributing the fruits of the revolution, ending the movement with a celebration rally. Therefore, many feudal remnants remained hidden and were not discovered. (2) Class divisions were not clear, so some landlords, after dispersing their property, were considered middle peasants, while some middle peasants were wrongly regarded as landlords and were liquidated or forced to donate land. (3) Ideological education was neglected during the movement, so after distributing land, people breathed a sigh of relief and did not pay attention to the landlords' conspiracies. Now, the entire county is concentrating cadres to study the discovered problems and continue to conduct in-depth reviews. The method of proceeding is divided into three types of villages: (1) Villages where feudal exploitation has been completely eliminated, inspiring peasants with the idea of ​​getting rich and preparing for production and organizational rectification. (2) Villages that still have feudal remnants, educating peasants to conduct in-depth reviews. (3) Villages where land rights have not been determined, demarcating boundaries and establishing new contracts.

　　阶级未划清地主钻空子
    王屋深入追查
    【本报太岳二十一日电】王屋在土地改革复查中，又发现封建尾巴。铁山、看村、北李凹等村地主，逃避斗争，进行假清算，全县除三区一部外，普遍村庄未确定地权及立新契，其原因：（一）只从表面看问题，各村在旧历年前完成任务，突击斗争及分配果实，以开过庆祝大会结束了运动，因此许多封建尾巴依然隐藏着未被查出。（二）划分阶级不明确，因此有些地主分散财产后被认为中农，有些中农反当作地主被清算或献田。（三）在运动中忽视思想教育，所以在分配土地后大松一口气，未注视地主的阴谋。现在全县正集中干部研究所发现之问题，继续进行深入复查。进行方式分为三种类型村庄：（一）封建剥削已经彻底消灭的村子，启发农民发家致富思想，准备生产整顿组织。（二）仍有封建尾巴的村子，教育农民深入复查。（三）地权未确定村庄，划界立新契。
