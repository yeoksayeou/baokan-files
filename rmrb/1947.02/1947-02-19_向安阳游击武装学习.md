　　Learning from the Anyang Guerrilla Armed Forces
    The Anyang guerrilla force has taken the initiative to strike deep into the enemy's rear. In one month, they have engaged in over a hundred battles, large and small, and achieved significant victories. The Duan Fazhang working team alone has recovered more than ten villages and established small guerrilla base areas. Like a sharp blade, they are plunged into the enemy's heart, inspiring the people behind enemy lines, frightening the enemy and puppet bandits, and preparing favorable conditions for our all-out counter-offensive.
    The reason why the Anyang guerrilla warfare has been able to develop rapidly is mainly because all their actions demonstrate their determination to protect the interests of the masses, and to sacrifice themselves to serve the people. For example, Zhang Dingkui, the captain of the Tenth District, said after being wounded: "I still want to serve the people, I still want to fight. Although I am missing a hand, I still have one hand to kill the enemy..." Duan Fazhang also encouraged himself and his soldiers with the same words, "It is glorious to die for the people." Therefore, they can unanimously display a spirit of actively attacking the enemy, seizing the opportunity to fight the enemy, and completely annihilating them, creating a brilliant example of a seven-to-two-hundred casualty ratio between us and the enemy in one month. Their tenacious fighting spirit of taking the initiative to attack at the cost of sacrifice is a model for armed workers in the border areas!
    Chiang's army is doomed to failure, and the counter-offensive stage of our army is coming soon. In order to cooperate with the main force's counter-offensive and recover all lost territories, all localities must promptly bring out all their strength and vigorously carry out guerrilla warfare. As long as we resolutely implement the Party's policies, rely closely on the masses, and fight heroically, we will surely achieve victory.

　　向安阳游击武装学习
    安阳游击队主动出击深入敌后，一月来大小战斗一百余次，且获重大战果，仅段法章武工队，即收复十余村庄，创立了小型游击根据地，像一把利刃，插在敌人心脏里，振奋敌后人心，惊破敌伪贼胆，且为我全面反攻，准备下有利条件。
    安阳游击战之所以能够飞跃发展，主要是他们一切行动，处处表现着为保护群众利益，抱着不惜牺牲为民立功的决心，如十区张鼎魁队长负伤后说：“我还要为人民立功，我还要战斗，我虽然缺了一只手，可是还有一只手可以杀敌……。”段法章亦同样以“为人民而死是光荣的”鼓励自己，鼓励战士。因此，他们能全体一致发挥积极向敌人进攻的战斗精神，抓住敌人就打，而且干脆彻底的歼灭敌人，造成一月来我、敌伤亡七比二百的光辉战例。他们这种不惜牺牲主动出击的顽强斗志，足为边沿区武装工作者的榜样！
    蒋军败局已定，我军反攻阶段即将到来，为配合主力反攻收复一切失地，各地必须及时拿出一切力量，大力开展游击战争，而且只要我们坚决执行党的政策，紧紧依靠群众，英勇奋斗，我们一定能得到胜利。
