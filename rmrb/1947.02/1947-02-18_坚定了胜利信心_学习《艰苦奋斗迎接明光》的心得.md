Here are two more articles on ideological education and business learning, coming from new business people and financial workers. We still sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will earnestly study Chairman Mao's thought and their own businesses. If there are any practical insights, we would still like to publish them in the future.

　　Strengthened Confidence in Victory
    ——Insights from Studying "Hard Struggle to Welcome the Bright Future"
    Zhao Tongfeng, Changzhi City General Chamber of Commerce

    I.
    The peace negotiations after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan should not be seen entirely as a fantasy of peace; rather, they were a political victory for us. After a year of negotiations, agreements, and repeated sabotage by the Chiang side, the people recognized the Communist Party's sincerity in striving for peace and understood that Chiang Kai-shek, the American running dog, would never allow the people to have peace. The Communist Party gained greater faith among the broad masses of the people. In particular, Chairman Mao's personal visit to Chongqing further enhanced his prestige throughout the country and the world.

    II.
    Chiang Kai-shek tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the reactionary American government aided Chiang in the civil war. One replaced Wang Jingwei, and the other replaced Japanese imperialism. This is not surprising; it is the inevitable struggle of the reactionary and feudal landlord running dogs of the monopoly bourgeoisie when they are at the end of their rope. In the future, they will become even more frantic and rampant, reaching the peak, which will be the day of their death.

    III.
    Strengthened my confidence in our victory, and recognized the strength of the people in the liberated areas. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the liberated areas have the hard struggle of 140 million soldiers and civilians, have implemented land reform, the peasants have turned over, and are implementing a new democratic political system. People from all walks of life are united, and workers, peasants, businessmen, troops, and cadres are all studying Chairman Mao's thought. The troops are fighting well at the front, training well, and doing a good job of mass work; the masses in the rear are ensuring the supply of soldiers, ammunition, and grain, and are doing a good job of medical rescue work. The soldiers and civilians of the entire liberated area are fighting on the stand of national independence, peace, and democracy, steadfast and unyielding, sacrificing and struggling, and have become an invincible force. This is the basis for saying that the people will inevitably win, and the time will not be far off.

    IV.
    Believe that the difficulties in our finances and economy are difficulties that can be overcome. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, we have been fighting while producing. Most areas have achieved "cultivating three years and having one year's surplus." This year, we have launched a large-scale production campaign. All walks of life, troops, and institutions are full of confidence in production. The vast majority of peasants who have turned over will flock to the production front. The leadership has also paid attention to cleaning up public and private property, strictly prohibiting extravagance and waste, and calling for thrift and frugality. Self-sufficiency in the liberated areas is conditional and inevitably achievable. According to our business experience, as long as everyone in the shop is enthusiastic and everyone is diligent, we will not only not go bankrupt, but we will definitely make money.

    V.
    Believe that the economic crisis of American imperialism will arrive this year or next. American goods entering China have bankrupted even those in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who sell food and drink (cakes, steamed buns, etc.). Five mao of legal tender can buy a box of American cigarettes, which shows that the United States has overproduction and is desperately seeking outlets. But its expansion policy is becoming increasingly isolated, and its dumping policy is opposed by the people of all countries. The upsurge of resisting the invasion of American goods is unstoppable. Their own people cannot afford to buy them, and China and other countries are resisting them everywhere. This serious crisis can no longer be escaped. Our responsibility is to resolutely resist American goods and develop the industry and commerce of the liberated areas.

　　坚定了胜利信心
    ——学习《艰苦奋斗迎接明光》的心得
    长治市商联总会  赵桐封
    一、
    抗战胜利后的和平谈判，不能完全看做和平幻想，恰恰是我们在政治上取得的胜利。经过一年的和谈、协议和蒋方的一再破坏，人民认识了共产党争取和平的诚意，懂得了美国走狗蒋介石决不让人民有和平。共产党在广大人民间取得更大的信仰。尤其是毛主席亲临重庆，更在全国和全世界提高了威望。
    二、
    蒋介石撕毁政协决议，美国反动政府援蒋内战，一个代替汪精卫，一个代替日本帝国主义，不是奇怪的事，是独占资产阶级反动派和封建地主走狗买办们处在穷途末路时必然的挣扎，今后还会更疯狂更猖獗，达到顶点，就是他死亡的日子。
    三、
    坚定了自己的胜利信心，认识了解放区人民的力量。解放区有毛主席的英明领导，有一万万四千万军民的艰苦奋斗，实行了土地改革，农民们翻了身，执行着新民主主义的政治制度，各阶层人士都团结一致，不论工人、农民、商人、部队、干部都在学习着毛主席思想。部队在前方，打好仗，练好兵，做好群众工作；群众在后方，保证了兵员弹药、粮食的供给，并做好医药救护工作。全解放区军民站在为祖国独立、和平、民主的立场上作战，坚强不屈，牺牲奋斗，成为一支不可战胜的力量，这就有根据说人民必然要胜利，而且时间还不会很远。
    四、
    相信了我们财政经济的困难，是可以克服的困难。我们自抗战以来，就是一边打仗、一边生产，大部分地区做到耕三余一，今年开展了大生产运动，各行各业、部队机关、都充满了生产信心，绝大多数的翻身农民，更会涌上生产战线，领导上又注意了清理公私财产，严戒了铺张浪费，号召了节衣缩食，解放区的自给自足，是有条件也是必然能做到的。依我们做生意的经验，只要铺子里人人热心、大家勤快，不仅决赔不垮，而且一定赚钱。
    五、
    相信了美帝国主义的经济危机，今年或明年就会到来。美货侵入中国，把蒋管区卖吃喝（糕、馍等等）的，都顶垮了。五毛法币就可以买美国纸烟一盒，这说明了美国生产过剩，拚命寻找出路。但是他的扩张政策，日近孤立，倾销政策，遭到各国人民反对。抵制美货侵略的高潮，无可阻止。他们本国人民买不起，中国和其他国家到处抵制，它这个严重危机，再也逃不过去了。我们的责任就是坚决抵制美货，发展解放区的工商业。
