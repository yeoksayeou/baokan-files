　　Military Industry Department Factories Launch Merit Competition
    Many People's Heroes Emerge in Yuanchao, Puyang
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the "Serve the People and Earn Merit" campaign was launched in front-line troops, local troops, militias, guerrillas, and war support departments, it has achieved great results and further elevated the campaign. This movement is continuing to develop in front-line combat units and is expanding to rear service departments.
    Following the Military Industry Department's Third Factory's proposal for a "Support the Front Line and Earn Merit" competition to the First Factory, and the First Factory's challenge to the entire region, the campaign has gradually unfolded in various factories. On the 8th of this month, at a joint meeting of political work cadres and trade union cadres from the department's factories, it was decided to adopt the creation of a "Liu Bocheng Factory" as the banner of the movement to launch a widespread competition and implement Chairman Mao's policy of "large quantities, good quality, low cost, and sufficient raw materials." The specific requirements are: (1) Complete and exceed the specified tasks on time. (2) Maximize the power of existing machines, personnel, and tools, ensuring that no machine stops or a production step is affected for any reason. (3) Avoid damaging machine tools, repair, improve, and create machine tools. (4) Improve the political and technical level of apprentices and masters, increasing output and reducing waste each month. New apprentices should be able to perform specialized work within three months at the latest. (5) Establish work rules for each department and strictly adhere to them. (6) Save on raw materials and materials. (7) Strictly enforce various accounting systems and cost accounting. (8) Strengthen the unified leadership of the Party in the factory, closely integrate the relationship between the branch, administration, and trade union. Promote a democratic style, fully leverage the enthusiasm and creativity of employees, and truly grasp the principles of "mutual benefit for both public and private" and "public before private." Strengthen ideological education for employees, practice strict economy, and organize family production. Currently, each factory in the department has formulated specific plans, and all employees have been swept up in the competition.
    On the 14th and 15th of this month, the Second Branch Factory of the Military Industry Department convened an emergency meeting of all cadres above the rank of foreman in the factory. Political Instructor Chen Niu called for the launch of a merit campaign to produce more artillery shells to support the front line. Following the reading of the challenge letter from the Installation Department, all cadres unanimously approved joining the First Branch Factory in challenging all factories under the leadership of the Military Industry Department, striving to become a glorious "Liu Bocheng Factory."
    Since the launch of the merit campaign in Yuanchao, models have emerged in large numbers. Zhang Jingzong, the military minister of the district committee, led the militia three times to fight the enemy, showing courage, composure, and boldness. His consistent positive work has earned him a major merit. Wang Tong, Wang Jihan, and Cao Dianling, three cadres from the Fourth District, have a good work style and outstanding performance, earning them two merits each. Guo Zengqi, the militia captain of Xitian Village in the Seventh District, voluntarily led three militiamen to the front line to participate in combat groups, cooperating with the troops. He received a commendation from the district armed forces committee. In war support work, Han Hongzhang, the village chief of Dawangzhai Village, voluntarily led the entire village's stretcher team to the front line, completing the task in freezing weather. Wang Xuezhong, the director of the Beizhuang Farmers' Association, led a work team of over ten people to patrol various villages every night, inspecting work without complaint. Han Jinting, the militia captain of Hanzhuang, Pan Yichen, the head of Zhanglu Town, Yue Jijing, the public security officer of Wujiahe, Yue Senlin, the community cadre of Lv Village, and Wang Hongjun of Wangjiazhuang have all played a leading role in their work. The district has issued a commendation order to them and encouraged them to continue their efforts.
    Since the launch of the Xia Shuping campaign in Puyang, cadres in various places have actively persisted in the struggle against the enemy, determined to earn merit for the people. Comrade Xu Zhiyi, the acting director of the Second District's Suppression Department of the county, persisted in the struggle for seven days and seven nights when the enemy occupied Puyang. He also led the guerrillas in actively fighting the enemy, engaging in more than ten battles in a month, capturing fifty-nine enemies. The Fourth Prefectural Committee specifically commended him. In the Seventh District, during the Lunar New Year, a campaign was launched among all district cadres, guerrillas, and militiamen to elect combat heroes and models of hardship. Liu, the district head, Jiang Zhenwu, Cheng Bajin, and militiaman Chang Yufa, along with ten other comrades, were elected. In the Gaozhai battle, District Head Liu personally led eleven people to repel the Kuomintang and puppet troops' attack, recovering grain and supplies. He is also a model of hard struggle, personally cooking and working day and night in the freezing cold and snow without complaint. Before Puyang was occupied by Chiang's army, Jiang Zhenwu bravely carried stretchers twice. After Chiang's army occupied it, he called on cadres to disarm and go deep into the villages to work, and he was the first to volunteer. Cheng Bajin served as a vanguard in every battle, charging ahead. These heroes of the people fought hard for two months, repelling the attacks of puppet troops and protecting the interests of the masses.
