    Several Experiences in the Land Leveling Movement in Lin County
    Popularly Publicize "Land to the Tiller"
    Mobilize the Poor and Hired Peasants to Unite the Majority
    (1) Universally, openly, and boldly publicizing the policy of "land to the tiller" is a crucial link in supporting the people in becoming masters of their own affairs. The movement proved that villages that did this saw rapid and full mobilization of the masses. Conversely, the movement would not unfold smoothly. For example, at the beginning of the movement in Chengguan, the middle peasants were afraid to act due to the "cutting the leeks" mentality, and the poor and hired peasants thought, "We have no problems to raise, and we will never be able to turn ourselves around." As a result, the village cadres felt that "leveling and replenishing is not the demand of the broad masses" and were not active; some district cadres also said, "Villages like these without a work foundation should not engage in leveling and replenishing for the time being." After the district leadership discovered this, they criticized these arguments and helped the village cadres hold a mass meeting of all the people in Chengguan, boldly publicizing: "Thoroughly eliminate feudalism, implement leveling and replenishing, what is feudalism, who to mobilize, who to struggle against, who to unite," and made it clear that they would support the masses in taking charge, and the masses quickly started to work, and the target was very accurate. The district cadres working in Xiyu and Sangyuan villages only stayed within the circle of village cadres and did not boldly publicize "land to the tiller," and the masses were not mobilized for a long time.
    (2) Taking the poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite the majority of the masses, to mobilize the poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to support and encourage them, dispel their ideological concerns, and inspire them to "find the root of poverty and pursue the truth." Generally, there are several ways to do this: First, district cadres go directly to each household for individual mobilization and hold small forums to discover activists; second, rely on good village cadres to mobilize; third, district cadres help the village hold a poor and hired peasant grievance meeting, some even hold joint defense meetings. After the movement started, attention should be paid to cultivating poor and hired peasant leaders. Many villages absorb the poor and hired peasants into the land investigation committee and the fruit evaluation committee (for example, poor and hired peasants account for half of the Wangjiazhuang evaluation committee), and let them participate in the presidium during meetings, so that they can exercise their abilities, establish prestige, and master leadership in the movement, which is very effective. To mobilize women, we must start with mobilizing poor and hired peasant women, and it must be closely combined with mobilizing men. Lijiazhuang used the method of "mobilizing the entire family of poor and hired peasants to complain about their suffering" to unify the movement of men and women. After the poor and hired peasants are truly mobilized, uniting the middle peasants becomes their urgent demand, because they feel that without the broad middle peasants, it will not be easy to defeat the landlords. For example, the poor and hired peasants and middle peasants in Longmiao Village jointly held a grievance meeting to help the middle peasants "unload their burdens," which is a typical example. After the great unity of the poor, hired, and middle peasants, educating the "running dogs" and digging the landlords' "air-raid shelters" became the main problems of uniting the majority and isolating the landlords. We must not hate these people, but patiently help them to awaken. For example, in Qilintai, more than a dozen honest peasants were found to be hiding things for the landlord Li Jianji. After everyone concentrated their efforts to educate them, these people said, "Separate from the landlord," and quickly took out the things, and Li Jianji was completely isolated.
    Exhibiting Fruits, Educating the Masses
    (3) Holding fruit exhibitions to educate the masses and promote the movement. After the major movement, each base point seized the time to hold exhibitions of the fruits of the struggle, educating the masses with the fruits and letting the most awakened emancipated peasants speak, arousing the peasants' hatred for the landlords. For example, Li Heyang, a very poor man in Chengguan, held a newly distributed quilt in one hand and a tattered quilt that he used to beg for food in the other at the exhibition meeting, and said to the masses: "This new quilt was given to me by the Communist Party. I will protect it well. I will not destroy this tattered quilt, but hang it on the wall and look at it every day as a memorial to my suffering. I will not destroy it until the reactionaries no longer exist, because as long as the reactionaries are there, the poor will suffer." After the Xiencheng base point held the fruit exhibition meeting, the masses all said: "This is better than holding a ten-day meeting. We will go back and settle accounts with the landlords thoroughly."
    Transforming Cadres, Not Negating Achievements, Not Accommodating Backwardness
    (4) Transforming cadres in the movement. At the beginning of the leveling movement, there were problems with cadres: 1. They turned themselves around and forgot the masses; 2. Their work style was not democratic, and they gained too many fruits; 3. They sheltered landlords; 4. Bad elements mixed into the cadres. These were all obstacles to deepening the movement. When solving these problems, we generally adopted the transformation policy of "not negating achievements, not accommodating backwardness." Experience has proved that transforming cadres must be carried out in the movement to be successful. In terms of practice: One is to first hold a cadres' meeting to examine and understand the ideology, and then examine themselves to the masses. This is mostly carried out in places with a relatively solid work foundation; the second is to leave the cadres aside and directly mobilize the masses to educate the cadres. For example, Cui Quanxi, the chairman of the Nanguan Farmers' Association, was a very poor man who sheltered landlords. After individual education, he did not change. Later, the masses rose up and left him aside for a day and a night. He was so anxious that he could not sleep all night. The next day, he automatically reflected to the masses and said, "Everyone left me aside, and I felt like I had lost my life. Compared with the landlords, the masses are more important." Through this, he quickly changed. However, for those who refuse to change to the end, the masses can replace them. However, for landlord elements who have infiltrated the struggle, they must be resolutely purged through the masses. For example, at the Chengguan base point, after fifteen bad cadres were replaced, fifteen poor and hired peasants were immediately promoted, and the movement did not suffer any losses.
    Comparing Suffering, Comparing Time, Leveling First, Replenishing Later
    (5) New experience in distributing fruits. First of all, solve ideological problems. For example, in order to break the idea of ​​dividing by shares, dividing by opinions, and dividing equally among people in Dongguan, a discussion was launched among the masses on issues such as: comparing suffering, comparing crimes, comparing time, settling accounts, and comparing struggles to see who gets more fruits. Finally, the masses established the idea of ​​leveling. Secondly, in the organization of the evaluation committee, more poor and hired peasants should be absorbed. When distributing things, all places grasped the principle of "filling the holes first and replenishing later." Land, houses, and grain were leveled, and miscellaneous items were replenished. This leveling is the most thorough. For example, in Dongguan, 84 households out of 50 households that were replenished received fruits. Military cadres and demobilized soldiers were given preferential treatment. For example, in Wangjiazhuang, 18 households, that is, 18 households, received fruits.

    林县填补运动中的几点经验
    普遍宣传耕者有其田
    发动贫雇团结大多数
    （一）普遍的公开的大胆的宣传耕者有其田的政策，这是撑腰作主的主要一环，运动中证明：那个村这样做了，群众发动即迅速、充分。反之，运动就不会顺利的展开。如城关运动开始，中农因“割韭菜”思想而不敢动；贫雇认为“咱没问题可提，永翻不了身”。因此村干部觉得：“填平补齐不是广大群众的要求”，亦不积极；部分区干部亦说：“像这些工作没基础的村，暂且不用搞填平补齐”。区领导上发觉后，批判了这些论点，并帮助村干部召开全城关群众大会，大胆宣传了：“彻底消灭封建，实行填平补齐，啥是封建，发动谁，斗争谁，团结谁”，并表明要给群众作主，群众很快就干起来，而且目标打的很准。在西峪、桑园两村工作的区干部，只是钻在村干部圈子里，没有大胆宣传耕者有其田，群众好久也未发动起来。
    （二）以贫雇为骨干，团结多数群众，要把贫雇发动起来，就必须给他们撑腰鼓气；解除其思想顾虑，启发“找穷根、追真理”。一般有以下几种办法：一是区干部直接深入各户个别动员，开小型座谈会，发现积极分子；二是依靠好的村干部去发动；三是区干部帮助村召开贫雇农诉苦大会，有的还以联防开。运动起来后，就要注意培养贫雇领袖，许多村是把贫雇吸收到查田委员会及果实评议会中（如王家庄评议会中贫雇即占一半），开会时让他们参加主席团，使其在运动中锻炼能力，树立威信，掌握领导权，收效很大。发动妇女，也要从发动贫雇妇女入手，并要与发动男人紧密结合，李家庄就是用“发动贫雇农全家诉苦”的办法，使男女运动统一起来的。贫雇真正发动起来，团结中农就成为他们的迫切要求，因为他们感到没有广大中农，就不易斗垮地主。如龙庙村贫雇农与中农共同开诉苦会，帮助中农“解包袱”，即是一个典型例子。贫苦、中农大团结后，教育“狗腿”与挖地主的“防空洞”就成为团结多数，孤立地主的主要问题。对于这些人不能仇视，而是耐心的帮助他们觉悟。如麒麟台发现有十多个老实农民给地主李见基隐藏东西，经大家集中力量教育，这些人便说：“与地主分家”，很快便拿出东西，李见基便完全孤立。
    展览果实  教育群众
    （三）开果实展览会，教育群众，推动运动。大运动过去，各基点都抓紧开了斗争果实展览会，对着果实教育群众，并让最觉悟的翻身农民讲话，激起了农民对地主的仇恨。如城关赤贫李合羊，在展览大会上，一手拿着刚分下的一条新被子，一手拿的他过去要饭时的一条烂被子，向群众说：“这新被是共产党给我，我要好好保护，这烂被我也不毁它，要挂在墙上，每天看它，作为我受难的纪念，啥时反动派不存在，我才毁它，因为反动派在一天，就有穷人受罪”。贤城基点开了果实展览大会后，群众都说：“这比开十天会都强，回去跟地主彻底算账。”
    改造干部  不抹煞功劳不迁就落后
    （四）运动中改造干部。填补运动开始，干部问题有：一、自己翻了身，忘了群众；二、作风不民主，多得果实；三、包庇地主；四、混进干部中的坏蛋。这些都是深入运动的障碍，解决时一般都是采取了“不抹煞功劳，不迁就落后”的改造方针。经验证明，改造干部必须在运动中进行才能搞好。做法上：一种是先开干部会检讨弄通思想，再向群众检讨，这多是在工作较有基础地方进行；二是丢开干部直接发动群众，教育干部。如南关农会主席崔全喜是个赤贫，包庇地主，经个别教育不改，后来群众起来，丢开他一天一夜，他就急坏了，一夜睡不着觉，第二天即自动向群众反省说：“大家把我丢开，我就好像丢开命一样，地主和群众比起来，还是群众要紧”，经此，他很快便转变了。但对死不转变的人，经过群众可以撤换。但是对于混进斗争中的地主分子，要通过群众坚决清洗出去，如城关基点，撤换了十五个坏干部后，马上提拔了十五个贫雇，运动一点也没受损失。
    比痛苦比时光  先填平后补齐
    （五）分配果实的新经验。首先解决思想问题，如东关为打破按股分，按意见分，按人平均分的思想，即在群众中展开了：比痛苦、比受罪、比时光、算总账，比斗争以求谁得果实多等问题的讨论，最后群众便树立了填补的思想。其次，在评议会的组织上，要多多吸收贫雇。在分东西时，各地均掌握了：“先填窟窿后补齐”的原则，地、房、粮、填平，杂物补齐，这样填补最彻底，如东关补零五十户中八十四户得到果实。军干属与荣退军人都受到优待，如王家庄十八户，即有十八户分得果实。（万达、余光、万里、振刚、波涛）
