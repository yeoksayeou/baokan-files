    Overcoming Ideological Concerns Through Organized Visits:
    Licheng Immigrants Gain Experience
    [This newspaper, Taihang, 5th] The partial immigration implemented in Licheng has yielded preliminary experience. The first step was to overcome ideological concerns. Initially, immigrants exhibited thoughts such as "Longing for the east while giving up the west, fearing ending up with nothing" and "Home is good for a thousand days, but it's always difficult when you go out." To resolve these issues, assurances were made that they would definitely be able to turn their lives around, and immigrants were organized to visit, such as Chiyu and Jiulongshan, who first visited Xiwu Village. Furthermore, a Chiyu veteran, who had settled in Xiwu, returned to his village to promote, saying, "Go! Turning your life around is not a problem," dispelling everyone's concerns. Thirty-two families, totaling ninety people, were relocated from Xiwu Village alone. In their original villages, these immigrants had an average of only one mu of land per person and one room per household. After being allocated the fruits of labor upon relocation, they had an average of 3.1 mu of land, one room, over nine dou of grain, and over one thousand yuan per person. After the immigrants settled down, new and old households held a joint celebration. The newcomers gratefully said, "If it weren't for the leadership of the government and everyone's help, we wouldn't be able to turn our lives around in this lifetime." At the meeting, sixteen immigrants immediately signed up to join the militia, fostering a very harmonious relationship between new and old households.

    打破思想顾虑组织参观
    黎城移民取得经验
    【本报太行五日电】黎城实行部分移民，获得初步经验。首先是打破思想顾虑，开始时，移民中发现有“想望东，舍了西，恐怕落个两手空”及“在家千日好，出门时时难”的思想。解决这些问题，提出保证一定能翻了身，再组织移民参观，如赤峪和九龙山，就是先到西仵村参观。又有赤峪一荣誉军人，移在西仵安了家，回村宣传说：“去吧！翻身不成问题”，打破了大家的顾虑。仅西仵一村移来的即有三十二家，九十口人，这些移民在原来村，每人平均只有一亩地，每户平均一间房。移来分果实后，每人平均有三亩一分地、一间房、九斗多粮、一千多元钱。移民安家后，新旧户开联欢会，新来户感激的说：“如果不是政府领导与大家帮助，我们一辈也不能翻身。”会上移民十六人，当场报名参加民兵，新旧户间甚为融洽。
