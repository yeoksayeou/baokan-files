Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to TASS, Tokyo: On January 28th, the number of participants in the anti-cabinet demonstration in Tokyo reached 350,000, not the previously estimated 50,000. At a rally in the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, representatives from the Government and Public Office Employees Union, the Japan Transportation Workers' Union, the Japan Labor Union Council, the Japan Federation of Industrial Workers, and other affiliated labor unions delivered speeches, unanimously condemning the Yoshida government's policies. They declared that the Yoshida government was launching an attack on the working masses and aggravating inflation for selfish purposes. Speakers demanded the immediate dissolution of the Yoshida government, reiterating the demand of the broad masses to form a people's democratic government composed of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other working-class and peasant organizations. A spokesman for the Labor Federation stated in his speech that the Federation did not oppose forming a cabinet in coalition with conservatives, which was strongly opposed by the participants. A representative of the "Democratic Culture League" denounced right-wing Socialist Party leaders Nishio Suehiro and Hirano as traitors to the working masses. The speech by Japanese Communist Party leader Okano Susumu was deeply supported by the masses. He declared: "Forty days have passed since we gathered in the same place for the same purpose last month. At that time, the Yoshida government did not want to pay attention to the workers' demands for the cabinet to resign and dissolve the Diet. Now, this government is on the verge of collapse. It can be seen from the fact that the democratic spirit of Japanese workers has greatly increased in these forty days, that government and public office employees and workers, who have always been considered the most conservative class of laboring people, have also stood at the forefront of the struggle today. The government has found it difficult to delay the implementation of the workers' demands. It only has two ways to maintain its position: one is to use force to suppress, and the second is to finally put out a 'coalition cabinet,' which is nothing more than a way to paralyze the working class struggle by inviting socialists to join the government. Such a government is still a continuation of the current capitalist landlord and bureaucratic government. In other words, it is the same old wine in a new bottle. But they will never be able to deceive the workers. A government that is indifferent to the laboring masses, who account for 95 percent of the country's population, and to the masses who live in unbearable circumstances, is the enemy of the nation." Okano Susumu warned everyone not to be overly optimistic, saying: "There are still many difficulties on the road. The general strike scheduled for January 1st will affect the fate of the country." The conference passed a resolution condemning police terror. Other resolutions opposed the conspiracy to establish a right-wing coalition government, calling for the immediate resignation of the Yoshida government and its replacement by a people's democratic government.

　　东京倒阁示威游行
    三十五万日人参加
    冈野进演说揭穿了吉田诡计斥其假装改组政府欺骗人民
    【新华社延安一日电】据塔斯社东京讯：一月二十八日东京一地、倒阁示威游行参加人数达三十五万人，并非前此估计之五万人。在皇宫前广场大会上，政府及公共机关雇员工会、日本交通工人工会、日本劳工组合会、日本产业工人联合会，及其他联工会代表均发表演讲，一致谴责吉田政府的政策。他们宣称：吉田政府正进行对工人群众的进攻，为自私目的加重着通货膨胀。演说者要求立即解散吉田政府。重申广大群众的要求，即组织社会党、共产党及其他工人阶级和农民团体组成的人民民主政府。劳工联合会发言人于演说中曾谓，该会不反对与保守派联合组阁，受到与会者极力的反对。“民主文化同盟”代表指斥社会党右翼领袖西尾至平野为工人群众的叛徒。日共领袖冈野进的发言深受群众拥护，他宣称：“自从上月我们抱同样的目的在同样的地方聚会以来，四十天已过去了，那时候吉田政府不想注意工人要求内阁辞职和解散国会的呼声，现在这个政府已走向崩溃的边沿。在这四十天内日本工人的民主精神，有了很大的增强，从这个事实可以看出来，就是一向被认为是劳工人民中最保守的阶层的政府和公共机关的职员和工人，今天也站到斗争的前头来了。政府已感到很困难再延缓实现工人的要求，它只有两个办法来维持它的地位：一个就是用武力来镇压，第二个是最后搬出一个“联合内阁”来，这无非是以邀请社会党人加入政府的办法来麻痹工人阶级斗争而已。这样的政府，仍旧是目前资本家大地主和官僚政府的继续。换一句话说，换汤不换药。但是他们决计欺骗不了工人，对于占全国人口百分之九十五的劳动人民群众，对于处在不堪忍受的境况下生活的群众漠不关心的政府，就是国家的敌人。”冈野进警告大家，不要过份乐观，他说：“现在仍有许多困难在道途上，预定于元月一日举行的总罢工，将影响到国家的命运。”大会通过了一项谴责警察恐怖的决议案，其他决议案为反对设立右翼联合政府的阴谋，呼吁吉田政府立即辞职，由人民的民主政府来代替之。
