Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: Heavy taxes and levies in the Chiang-occupied areas of Central Jiangsu make it impossible for the people to live. In Zhigang, Liubao, Fanshui and other places in the suburbs of Baoying City, Chiang Kai-shek's self-defense forces went to the countryside to collect payments by force of arms around the end of the year, forcing every household to weep. The current "household tax" has increased to 70 catties of rice per household, the "population tax" is 40 catties of rice per person, and there are many other plundering items such as "township office operating expenses" and "military rice." Taking Wayaobao as an example, from October 5th of last year to January 5th of this year, in a period of three months, it has been extorted 454,600 yuan in legal tender and 40 shi of grain. In addition, 23.5 shi of "military rice" were forcibly purchased at one-third of the market price. Yao Wei and Lizhuang, landlords' stewards south of the Qingting River in Qintong, were forced by Chiang's army to pay a "household tax" of one shi of grain per household and a "gun fee" of two dou per mu. The stewards had no choice but to hand over all the surplus grain. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, they were again required to pay "miscellaneous expenses for district and township offices." The stewards were driven to the point of desperation and hanged themselves on the 17th of last month. Fortunately, they were discovered and saved by neighbors. Zhang Wanyou, a landlord in Huanghao District, Baoying, was taxed 60,000 yuan in legal tender and 13 shi of rice. Chiang's army then forced him to pay a "gun fee" of 800,000 yuan. At present, in order to survive, the people in various places are launching struggles against taxes and levies.
    
People's Daily, Jin-Lu-Yu Frontline, 9th: Among the deceptive propaganda materials seized from the Chiang Kai-shek army in the battles to recover Qicheng, Juye, Chengwu, and Shanxian, there is a "Three Gospels for the People in the Recovered Areas." The first one is "Stop confiscating grain." Let us look at the facts: More than 20 bags of wheat belonging to landlord Fan Zuolin of Dafan Village, Yuncheng, were snatched away by the Chiang Kai-shek army. Fan Zuolin's wife knelt down and begged, but was scolded by the Chiang Kai-shek army: "What is your grain? It all belongs to the Eighth Route Army!" The Chiang Kai-shek army took away 10,000 jin of wheat, more than 11,000 jin of white flour, 500 jin of rice, and more than 600 jin of miscellaneous grains from Qilipu, Yuncheng... The second "gospel" is: "Restore the people's freedom." The fact is: in the villages where the generals arrive, Baojia is immediately organized, and residents are required to guarantee each other in groups of five, and report to the Baojia chief when entering and leaving. When going out at night, you must carry a lantern, and each family must take a photo and buy a "residence permit." Checkpoints are set up everywhere on the streets, and notices are posted everywhere saying "Those who do not report guests will be severely punished." Farmers who have grain must also report the amount of grain they have stored to the government within a time limit." The third "gospel" is even more high-sounding: "Severely punish corrupt officials." Let's not talk about the four big thieves, Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen, who started their careers by corruption. Here, let's just look at the township head of Xiangu Store in Jinxiang County. In his 100-day term of office, he privately stored 30 bags of wheat and 500,000 in legal tender. The corruption of other district chiefs and county heads can be imagined. Chiang Kai-shek's three "gospels" are really the disasters for the people in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army!

    苏中蒋占区捐税苛重
    地主也被逼得上吊
    【新华社华中八日电】苏中蒋占区捐税苛重，人民无法生活。宝应城郊直港、柳堡、泛水等地，年关前后蒋记自卫队下乡武装催款，逼得户户啼哭。现“户口捐”每户增至大米七十斤，“人口捐”每口稻四十斤，其它“乡公所开办费”及“军米”等等掠夺名目甚多。以瓦窑堡为例，自去年十月五日至今年一月五日三月中，已被敲诈法币四十五万四千六百元，粮食四十石，另有以市价三分之一强购去二十三石半“军稻”，溱潼蜻蜓河南之姚圩、李庄地主管家银，蒋军向其逼索“门户捐”每户要一石粮食，“枪支费”每亩二斗。管无法，只得将全部余粮缴出。不意年关中又要“区乡公所杂支费”，管被逼得无路可走，遂于上月十七日悬梁自尽，幸被邻居发觉救下。宝应黄浩区地主张万有被捐去六万元法币及十三石稻后，蒋军又逼索“枪支费”八十万元。现各地人民为求生计，正纷纷开展抗捐斗争。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线九日电】我军收复祁城、巨野、城武、单县战斗缴获蒋军的欺骗宣传品中，有一种是“三项收复区人民的福音”。第一条“停止没收粮食”。我们且看看事实吧：郓城大樊庄地主樊作霖的麦子，被蒋军抢去二十多布袋，樊作霖的老婆跪下哀求，反被蒋军骂道：“什么你的粮食，这都是八路军的！”郓城七里铺被蒋军拉去麦子万斤，白面万一千余斤，米五百斤，杂粮六百余斤……。“福音”的第二条：“恢复人民自由”，事实是：将军所到的村庄，立即编保甲，居民要五家连保连坐，出入要向保甲长报告。夜间出门一定要打灯笼，每家要照像买“居住证”。街头四处设岗检查，“有客不报者严惩”的布告贴满街头。农民有粮食，也要限期向政府自行报告存粮数额”。第三条“福音”更官冕堂皇：“严惩贪污人员”。蒋宋孔陈贪污起家的四大贼户且不去讲他，这里只看看金乡县仙姑店的乡长，在任期一百天内，私存麦子三十袋，法币五十万，其他区长县长之贪污可想而知。蒋介石的三项“福音”实在是被蒋军侵占区人民的祸音！（君谦）
