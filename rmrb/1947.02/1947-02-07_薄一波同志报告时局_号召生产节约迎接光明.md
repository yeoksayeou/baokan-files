    Comrade Bo Yibo Reports on the Situation
    Calls for Production and Thrift to Welcome the Dawn
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On February 3rd, Comrade Bo Yibo reported on the current situation and tasks for this year at a meeting of party member cadres directly under the Central Bureau. He pointed out that the current domestic situation is on the eve of a nationwide democratic movement upsurge. The current political situation should be viewed more optimistically. He said: The symbol of this democratic movement upsurge is mainly seen from the KMT-controlled areas. (In the liberated areas, the people's enthusiastic support for the front lines and the thorough implementation of land reform and patriotic democratic movements are already at their peak.) From a political perspective: After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, our Party Central Committee put forward the proposition of peace, democracy, and unity. We have made every effort to achieve it, but Chiang Kai-shek has consistently adhered to the traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policies, and sabotaged the truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. These have long been recognized by the people of the whole country; especially its convening of the pseudo-National Assembly, the passage of the pseudo-constitution, and the signing of the traitorous Sino-American Commercial Treaty, which is even more thorough than the Twenty-One Demands signed by Yuan Shikai, have been abandoned by the people of the whole country. The Kuomintang is politically isolated. The unwavering attitude of the Democratic League is a clear sign. Chiang Kai-shek threatened them with assassination and enticed them with high-ranking officials and generous salaries, but they all refused. They insisted on the Political Consultative Conference stance. Why are they so determined? Because they see very clearly that the broken ship of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is about to sink to the bottom of the water; because the broad masses in the KMT-controlled areas are backing them. From a military point of view, Chiang Kai-shek has even more difficulties. In the past six months, the People's Liberation Army annihilated 45 brigades of the Chiang army. Everyone should understand: Chiang Kai-shek's strength to attack us is the strength accumulated during the eight years of passive resistance against Japan, plus the equipment after Japan's surrender, plus American weaponry. Although he had these forces, he was still annihilated by us in 45 brigades last year. In January alone this year, 14 brigades were annihilated. Now our army has gradually taken the initiative, and large areas of lost territory are being recovered. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to organize a new offensive in one area, he has to transfer troops from other battlefields. His troops are weak in combat effectiveness and not strong. Although they have American equipment, they will inevitably be annihilated in large numbers by us. Chiang Kai-shek, who lacks soldiers, made a plan to recruit 2 million soldiers last year, but only completed less than 200,000. The actual collection of agricultural tax is even more pitiful. Jiangsu is a rich area, but it only completed 0.5 percent. Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis of being unable to support his combat offensive is deepening. In terms of finance and economy, Chiang Kai-shek's crisis is even greater. Before the world economic panic has arrived, the economic crisis in the KMT-controlled areas has been destined to arrive, and has formed a general panic. In order to seek more assistance from its American masters to carry out dictatorial civil war, Chiang Kai-shek had to sell China's sovereignty to American imperialism and sign the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, causing a large dumping of American goods in the KMT-controlled areas and a large number of national industries to close down. This serious economic crisis is rapidly advancing Chiang Kai-shek's political and military crises. This kind of crisis is on the verge of breaking out. For example, the Shanghai stall incident and the Peiping U.S. military rape of female students incident have formed large-scale mass movements. In such a situation, even knowledgeable people in the Kuomintang and newspapers of the bourgeoisie in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin also recognize this point. They are also somewhat disappointed with the rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung and Chen families.
    On the contrary, the Communist Party's position in the country has been unprecedentedly improved. People of all strata throughout the country have placed their hopes on our Party, on the victory of the patriotic self-defense war in the liberated areas. Therefore, our liberated areas should use all their strength to win more victories and support the national democratic movement, promote each other, and welcome the arrival of the upsurge of the democratic movement.
    Comrade Yibo continued to analyze the current favorable international situation from the conditions of the United States' isolation, the Soviet Union's strength, and the world people's left-leaning, and then put forward our tasks under the current political situation. He said: On a national scale, unite all democratic parties, progressive people, and the people of the whole country to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek clique's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war, and strive for China's independence, peace, and democracy. In the liberated areas, the People's Liberation Army must continue to annihilate the enemy's effective strength. The party, government, army, and people in the rear must devote all their strength to support the front lines, annihilate more enemy troops, vigorously launch guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, persist in the struggle behind enemy lines, defeat the "reverse accounting" movement, continue to implement land reform, and launch a large-scale production movement. At this point, Comrade Yibo emphasized: In order to welcome the arrival of victory, we must ensure the supply needed for the self-defense war. The current contradiction before us is to supply the modern large-scale operations of large corps with a decentralized, backward, small-scale peasant economy, small-scale handicraft production, and inconvenient transportation. The financial difficulties arising from this contradiction must be fully understood. The solution is to launch a large-scale production movement. Some people think that production is too slow to solve the urgent problem, and put their calculations on commercial speculation or gambling. This is wrong. In addition, we must promote saving people's labor and promote scientific and rational calculation. For example, in war service work, the ratio of stretchers and civilians to combat troops required for each battle is enough to be one to one or one to one point five, while some troops and some areas use three to four or five, which are shocking wastes. Therefore, we must implement scientific calculation, not abuse a single manpower, and not waste a single yuan. At the same time, we must also universally carry out the thrift movement, save food and clothing to supply the front lines. All rear institutions should formulate their own production and thrift plans to carry out production and thrift in a planned way. Our principle is that everything is subordinate to the front line, the rear takes care of the front, and the local takes care of the army. In financial and economic work, we must guarantee the military supply of the front line with all our strength. As long as this work is done well, other construction works, even if they are done poorly or not well, should be rewarded. Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed changing the organizational and lifestyle, and called on the whole party to work hard. We must immediately change. In terms of organizational style, strict discipline is required, and bargaining under the pretext of clearing up thoughts is not allowed. At present, clearing up thoughts means everything for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. In terms of lifestyle, we must emphasize hard work and share the joys and sorrows with soldiers, and not emphasize anti-egalitarianism. This year, one set of summer clothing will be canceled, and office miscellaneous expenses will be reduced by half. The small stoves in the organs will be changed to medium stoves, and the medium stoves will be canceled altogether, and automatic thrift will be promoted. During the difficult period of the war, the lives of cadres and soldiers should gradually tend to be balanced. All departments of the agency should strictly clean up finances and rectify the rear. Half of all cleaned public grain and public funds will be turned over to the public, and half will be retained for self-use. Some of our cadres, because they entered the city last year, their living requirements have been raised, and coupled with the "peace" idea, they have relaxed labor production and forgotten the glorious tradition of hard work in the past, and now they must resolutely correct it. Overcoming all difficulties should be solved from the direction of production. The difficulties of each unit are encouraged to be solved independently; individual difficulties are solved by individuals, and do not push everything to the public and rely solely on the public.
    Finally, Comrade Yibo called on everyone: To resolutely respond to the call for production and thrift put forward by the Party, work hard in practical actions to produce and save, overcome difficulties, and welcome the arrival of the dawn.

    薄一波同志报告时局
    号召生产节约迎接光明
    【本报特讯】二月三日，薄一波同志在中央局直属机关党员干部大会上，报告目前形势及今年任务。指出目前国内情况，正处于全国民主运动高潮的前夜。对目前政治形势，应多从乐观方面去估计。他说：这一民主运动高潮的象征，主要是从蒋管区看的。（在解放区人民热烈支援前线，彻底实行土地改革爱国民主运动早已处于高潮。）从政治上看：抗战结束后，我党中央提出和平民主团结的主张，我们已尽一切努力求其实现，但蒋介石却一贯坚持卖国独裁内战政策，破坏停战令和政协决议，这些早已为全国人民所认识；特别是它召开伪国大通过伪宪法，签订卖国的比袁世凯所签订的二十一条卖的更彻底的蒋美商约，更为全国人民所共弃。国民党在政治上已处于孤立，民盟的坚定不移的态度，就是一个明显的标志。蒋介石用暗杀威胁他们，用高官厚禄引诱他们，他们都拒绝了。他们坚持政协立场。他们为什么会这样坚决呢？因为他们看得很清楚，蒋记反动集团这艘破船快要沉到水底去了；因为蒋管区的广大群众给他们作后盾。从军事上讲，蒋介石的困难更多。去年半年中，蒋军即被人民解放军歼灭四十五个旅，大家要了解：蒋介石向我们进攻的力量，是在八年消极抗战所积累起来的力量，加上日本投降后的装备，再加上美械化。他虽有这些力量，在去年亦被我消灭了四十五个旅。今年仅一月间，即消灭他十四个旅。现在我军已逐渐掌握主动权，大块失地正在收复中。蒋介石在一个地区若想组织新的进攻，就非抽调其他战场的军队不可了。其部队战斗力稀松，并不强，虽有美械装备，也免不了大批被我歼灭。兵员缺乏的蒋介石，去年作了二百万征兵计划，结果连二十万也未完成。田赋征实更为可怜，江苏是富饶地区，也只完成了百分之零点五。蒋介石不能支持其作战进攻的军事危机正在加深。在财政经济上，蒋介石的危机更大。世界经济恐慌尚未到来以前，蒋管区的经济危机就已经注定要到来，并已形成普遍性的恐慌。为了求得它美国主子的更多援助进行独裁内战，蒋介石又不得不把中国主权出卖给美帝国主义，签订蒋美商约，致美货在蒋管区大量倾销，民族工业大批倒闭。这种严重的经济危机，正飞速推进蒋介石的政治、军事危机。此种危机一触即发，如上海摊贩事件，北平美军强奸女生事件，均形成规模巨大的群众运动。在这样的情况下，连国民党中有识人士、京沪平津的资产阶级的报纸，也都承认这一点。他们对蒋宋孔陈四大家族的统治，也有些失望了。
    与此相反，共产党在全国的地位却空前提高了，全国人民、各阶层人士，都把希望寄托在我党身上，寄托在解放区爱国自卫战争的胜利上。因此，我们解放区应以一切力量多打胜仗，支援全国的民主运动，相互推动，迎接民主运动高潮的到来。
    一波同志继续从美国的孤立，苏联的强大，世界人民的左倾等条件，分析了目前有利的国际形势之后，提出了目前政治形势下我们的任务。他说：在全国范围内，联合各民主党派、进步人士、全国人民反对蒋介石集团卖国独裁内战，争取中国的独立和平与民主。在解放区，人民解放军要继续消灭蒋军有生力量，后方党政军民要拿出一切力量来支援前线，消灭更多蒋军，要用大力发动敌后游击战争，坚持敌后斗争，打退“倒算”运动，继续贯彻土地改革，开展大生产运动。至此，一波同志强调指出：为了迎接胜利的到来，我们必须保证自卫战争所需要的供给，目前摆在我们面前的矛盾，是以分散的落后的小农经济、小手工业生产，加上交通不便，去供应近代的大兵团的大规模的作战。由这一矛盾所产生的财政困难，必须足够认识。解决的办法是开展大生产运动。有些人认为生产缓不济急，把算盘放在商业投机或票板机上，这是错误的。此外，我们必须提倡节省民力，提倡科学的合理的计算。比如在战勤工作中，每次战役所需的担架、民夫与作战部队的比例，是一比一或一比一点五即够用了，而某些部队、某些地区，则用到三个以至四五个，这些都是惊人的浪费。所以，必须实行科学计算，不滥用一个民力，不枉用一元钱，同时我们也必须普遍开展节约运动，节衣缩食供应前线。一切后方机关，均应订出自己的生产节约计划来，有计划的进行生产节约。我们的原则是一切服从前线，后方照顾前方，地方照顾军队。在财政经济工作上，要以全付力量保证前线的军需供给，只要把这一工作作好，其他各种建设工作那怕做得差些，做得不好些，也应受到奖励。刘少奇同志提出改变组织方式与生活方式，号召全党艰苦奋斗，我们必须立即转变。在组织方式上，严格纪律，不准借口打通思想讨价还价。目前打通思想，就是一切为了打败蒋介石。在生活方式上，要强调艰苦奋斗与士卒共甘苦，不强调反平均主义。今年取消一套单衣，办公杂支费一律减发一半，机关小灶改成中灶，中灶一律取消，并提倡自动节约。在战争困难期间，干部与战士生活应逐渐趋于平衡。机关各部门，要严格清理财政，整顿后方，所有清理出来的公粮公款，决定一半缴公，一半留下自用。我们有些干部，由于去年进了城市，生活要求提高了些，再加上闹“和平”思想，因而放松了劳动生产，忘记了过去艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，现在必须坚决改正。克服一切困难，却应从生产方向去解决。各单位的困难，提倡各单位独立解决；个人困难，个人解决，不要一切推给公家，专门依赖公家。
    最后，一波同志号召大家：要坚决响应党所提出的生产节约的号召，在实际行动中努力生产节约，渡过困难，迎接光明到来。
