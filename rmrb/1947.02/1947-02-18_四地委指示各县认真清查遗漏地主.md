　　The Fourth District Committee Instructs All Counties to Conscientiously Investigate Omitted Landlords
　　[Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch on the 16th] The Jinnan Fourth District Committee recently issued instructions to Qianxi Ren County, Yaoshan, Baixiang, Lingping, Ningnan, and Nanhe, pointing out that after the basic completion of land reform, the issue of omissions should be resolved thoroughly with all efforts. Appropriate compensation should be given for past damages to the interests of middle peasants, and apologies should be made to middle peasants who were struggled against. Villages where the fruits of the struggle have not yet been fully distributed should distribute them completely and without reservation, paying particular attention to whether the landlords have been completely eliminated and whether there are instances of sham struggle. For landlords who have been generally settled after accounting, the Zhang Yongtai road should be explained to them, and they should be united to devote themselves to production.

　　四地委指示各县认真清查遗漏地主
    【本报威县十六日电】冀南四地委日前对迁西任县、尧山、柏乡、陵平、宁南、南和发出指示，指出在基本上完成土地改革后对遗漏问题，应全力深入解决。对过去损害中农利益应适当赔偿，并对被斗中农道歉。果实尚未分清的村庄应毫无保留的分净，特别注意清查地主是否完全消灭？是否有假斗争现象？对一般清算后地主，应解释张永泰道路，团结他们致力生产。
