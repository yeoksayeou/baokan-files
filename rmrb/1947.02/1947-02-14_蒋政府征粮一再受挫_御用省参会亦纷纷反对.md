Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 10th: According to newspapers in the Jiang-controlled areas, the Jiang government's deadline for grain collection has been repeatedly extended, but it has still failed to meet the predetermined target. Song Ziwen originally ordered all provinces to "fully deliver and resolve" by the end of December last year, but only 28 percent was collected by the deadline. The deadline was extended to the end of January this year, but by mid-January, only 40 percent of the grain collected in kind and only 0.1 percent of the grain converted to cash had been received. After the deadline passed again in January, the Central News Agency reported on the 6th of this month that Sichuan, "ranked second in the country (Jiang-controlled areas) in terms of grain collection performance," had only collected 80 percent. However, the reliability of this figure from the Central News Agency is actually highly questionable. The Jiang government's tyrannical grain collection policies have even been opposed by the puppet provincial assemblies of Jiangsu and Hubei provinces in recent times. The Standing Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly resolved on the 4th of last month to demand that the Jiang "Central Government" cease grain collection and borrowing from this year onwards. After the second provincial assembly opened on the 1st of this month, this was also a major topic of discussion, with some assembly members stating that it was "harmful to the people and detrimental, a cruel policy of the state." Influential provincial assembly members in Hubei also unanimously advocated for the cessation of grain collection this year, warning against breaking the rice bowls of the people and making it impossible for everyone to survive.

    蒋政府征粮一再受挫
    御用省参会亦纷纷反对
    【新华社延安十日电】据蒋区报纸讯：蒋政府征粮时限一再展延，终未能达成预定数字。宋子文原令各省限去年十二月底“扫数缴解”，但届期只收百分之二十八。复再限今年一月底“扫解”，至一月中旬，征实部分只收到百分之四十，折价部分则只获百分之零点一。至一月份已满，再度超过时限后，中央社于本月六日电称：“列为全国（蒋区）征实成绩第二”的四川，亦只收达八成。但中央社此数字之可靠性，实际尚大成疑问。蒋政府之征实暴政，甚至苏鄂两省御用省参会近亦表示反对。江苏省参会驻会委员会上月四日即决议要求蒋“中央”自本年起停止征实征借，本月一日第二次省参会开幕后，亦以此为主要议题，若干参议员均谓为“病民不利，国之虐政”。湖北较有声望之省参议员亦一致主张本年停止征实，借免敲碎饭碗，大家活不成。
