    Teachers and Students of Southern Hebei Schools Work Together to Establish a New School Spirit of Labor Production: Collecting Firewood, Gathering Manure, and Rolling Cigarettes to Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Life
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 10th dispatch] After the land reform, striving for production and honoring labor have become the new school spirit everywhere. Half a year ago, the desks and benches of the Qiaotou No. 3 High School in Fudong were made of piled-up bricks, the utensils were borrowed from the masses, there was no firewood for burning, and the meals were often not cooked properly. Everyone called it "Poor No. 3 High School." In order to get rid of this title, all the teachers and students of the school "contracted to pull" more than 2,000 mu of wheat during the wheat harvest last year, earning more than 8,000 yuan in wages. The teachers and students worked together to make 28 benches, 13 desks, 3 tables, and a fire door. The kitchen's steamers and bellows were also sawn from boards by themselves. They collected firewood twice a week, collecting 36,485 catties in two and a half months. Thanks to their active production, they picked a total of 1,600 catties of cotton last year. In order to take care of the students' production enthusiasm, the school put forward methods such as "four-six batch red" and electing labor heroes. The school distributed the odd change under a hundred to the students to buy stationery, clearly defined the shares for the round sum, and invested 2,000 yuan in the oil mill organized by the district office and 32,000 yuan in the cooperative in the village. They made a cigarette rolling machine themselves, which can produce more than 50 boxes of cigarettes a day, earning 2,300 yuan in just one week. Now they are rushing to make more cigarette rolling machines, preparing to roll more. After half a year of hard work, "Poor No. 3 High School" has become "Rich No. 3 High School." The No. 2 High School in Yuanchao used spare time to launch a firewood collecting campaign. Thirty-six students were divided into five groups, and teachers, staff, and odd-job workers also participated in groups. Before the old year, all firewood and bedding grass had been completely self-sufficient. No. 4 High School also launched a manure and firewood collecting campaign. After collecting for twenty days, each person collected an average of 300 catties of firewood. In addition to solving the firewood problem, they also piled up two large piles as high as houses. In order to respond to the call for saving production and supporting the front line, all the teachers and students of the Dongli Primary School in Guangzong held a meeting to study the incorrectness of the concept of "hating labor and loving ease" and decided to collect firewood. A student who was the most naughty in the new students also said: "Chairman Mao's son has to work and produce, why shouldn't we?" After the meeting, 90 teachers and students collected 3,054 catties in two days. The Yaoshan No. 4 District Primary School has more than 300 students, all of whom are peasant children who have been liberated. They are not afraid of hardship, study labor, and actively produce. In October, they bought two pigs, which have now earned 15,000 yuan. Every Sunday, all teachers and students go to the beach south of the village to cut grass, and they can cut 400 catties a day.

    冀南各校师生一齐动手
    树立劳动生产新校风
    打柴拾粪卷烟力求生活自给
    【本报威县十日电】土地改革后，努力生产，劳动光荣，已成各地新校风。阜东归家桥三高，半年前桌凳用破砖头垒成，用具向群众借，没有烧柴，饭也经常烧不熟，人人都呼为“穷三高”。全校师生为了洗掉这个称号，在去年过麦时“包拔”了二千多亩麦子，得工资八千余元。师生动手，自造了板凳二十八条、案子十三张、桌子三张、风门一个，火房的蒸笼、风箱也都是自己锯的板子，他们每星期拾两次柴，两个半月拾了三万六千四百八十五斤。在他们的积极生产下，去年共摘棉花一千六百斤。学校为照顾学生的生产情绪，提出了四六批红，选举劳动英雄等办法，学校把百数下的零钱都分给学生买文具，整数明确了股份，在区公所组织的油坊内入了两千元的股，在本村合作社内入了三万二千元。他们自造了一个卷烟机器，每天可出卷烟五十余盒，仅一个星期赚洋两千三百元。现又赶造卷烟机，准备多卷。经半年的努力“穷三高”已变成“富三高”了。元朝二高利用课余时间，展开拾柴运动，学生三十六人分五组，教职员、杂务员也都分组参加。旧年前烧柴、铺草均已全部自给。四高也发起了拾粪、拾柴运动，拾了二十天，平均每人拾柴三百斤，除了解决烧柴问题外，还堆积了像屋高两大堆。广宗董里完小为响应节约生产支援前线号召，全体师生开会研究了“恶劳好逸”观念的不正确，决定拾柴。新生中一个最挑皮同学也说：“毛主席的儿子还要生产劳动，咱凭啥不干”？会后师生九十人两天工夫，拾了三千零五十四斤。尧山四区完小共有学生三百余名，都是翻身后的农民子弟，他们在不怕艰苦，学习劳动，积极生产，十月里买了两口猪，到现在已赚了一万五千元。每星期日师生全体到村南沙滩去割草，每日能割四百斤。
