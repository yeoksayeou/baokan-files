    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Fifth Sub-district Guerrilla Militia
    Actively Attack "Home-Returning Corps"
    Eliminating Over 400 Enemies in a Month, Receiving Commendation from the Sub-district
    [Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch, 10th] The guerrilla militias of Heze, Dongming, and Changyuan counties in our Fifth Sub-district are active day and night behind enemy lines. According to incomplete statistics, they have eliminated a total of more than 460 enemies in the past month, seized more than 700 long and short guns and bullets, and killed four despots, including the notorious Zhou Erxun. The Fifth Sub-district has issued a special order of commendation and collectively awarded them a merit. On January 10th, a company of Chiang's troops in Heze, in coordination with more than 400 puppet troops and bandits, went to Chaoji to seize grain and conscript soldiers. They were defeated by our Heze working team, with more than 30 enemies eliminated. On the 16th, more than 40 puppet personnel from Daotun, Heze, went to the Duan Haixi village area of Heze to conscript soldiers and seize grain. Our militia, upon hearing the news, pursued them and, in addition to liberating seven captured civilians, also recovered three carts, thousands of catties of firewood, and 100,000 yuan, which were returned to the victimized masses. On January 21st, the guerrilla team of Dong (ming) Chang (yuan) County took the initiative to attack the puppet town team stronghold of Ge Datun Nan Song Village in the Second District of Dongming, annihilating all 20 personnel in the stronghold. The leader of the Home-Returning Corps, the despots Zhou Erhuaji and Song Dali, were killed. The next day, the puppet squadron leader of Dongmingji led more than 100 men to attack our Ge Datun, but we defeated them again, eliminating more than 10 people and capturing the squadron leader Zhou Erxun alive. After Chiang's troops occupied Dongming, Zhou turned traitor.
