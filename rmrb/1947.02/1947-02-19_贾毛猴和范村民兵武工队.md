　　Jia Mao Hou and the Fan Village Militia Guerrilla Unit
    Wang Boying
    The town of Fancun, with its population of over 1,500 households, is an important town connecting Taiyuan Prefecture in the north to Lucheng in the south. During the period of Japanese occupation, Fancun was used by the Japanese invaders as a throat to control the Taihang area from the Taigu plains. But it was during this period that Jia Mao Hou organized underground activities locally, regularly providing intelligence on the enemy and puppet forces in Fancun to the Eighth Route Army. For eight years, the people of Taigu were able to persevere in their victorious struggle under the brutal sweeps of the Japanese invaders, and their help was not insignificant.
    After the counter-offensive began, Jia Mao Hou and his comrades cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to liberate Fancun. This underground army became the publicly known Fancun Militia. However, Yan Xishan, the "Earth Emperor" who had ruled Shanxi for more than 30 years, wanted to enslave the people of Fancun again, and constantly invaded the area. Jia Mao Hou's militia rose up to fight against Yan's puppet regime, annihilating small groups of harassing enemies time and again, and shouldering the glorious task of defending their homeland.
    Last October, Yan's troops occupied × Zhuang, more than ten miles away from Fancun, and went out to loot grain and conscript soldiers. Jia Mao Hou led the militia to attack × Zhuang at night, firing dozens of shots and throwing several hand grenades. The enemy cowardly hid in their bunkers and fired machine guns wildly all night, wasting thousands of rounds of ammunition. Six days later, Yan's puppet troops from × Zhuang came to loot grain again, and were given a head-on blow by Jia Mao Hou's work team when they reached ×× village. One enemy company commander was killed and four were wounded. The enemy, enraged, launched a fierce counter-attack, and Jia Mao Hou was unfortunately wounded. A militiaman wanted to carry him off the battlefield, but he resolutely said: "We can't leave in this situation." He still endured the pain to direct the battle, and finally repelled the enemy, and the masses did not suffer any losses.
    In order to recover lost ground and defend the surrounding villages, Jia Mao Hou organized the militia teams of nearby villages into rotating strike teams, which often operated and attacked in Rencun (very close to the Yan's puppet stronghold). Wherever Jia Mao Hou's team was active, the "Village Governance Work Team" (Yan's armed secret service team) did not dare to show its face. But Jia Mao Hou always wanted to find an opportunity to strike a heavy blow against the "Village Governance Work Team."
    One day, he went to Rencun to investigate the situation. The village chief (Yan's spy) asked him: "Why does your machine gun only fire in single shots? Is it broken?" Jia Mao Hou guessed that there was a reason behind his words, and deliberately said: "It just can't fire continuously." The village chief then asked: "How many more days will you stay?" Jia Mao Hou saw through his plot and pretended not to know, saying: "We will disband tomorrow." The village chief immediately ran to report to the enemy, wanting to eliminate Jia Mao Hou's work team. Jia Mao Hou knew what was going on, and the next day deliberately took the team to play in ×× village for half a day. Only then did he explain the plan to everyone and set up an ambush. Sure enough, the ×× Village Governance Work Team boldly came running. When they approached ×× village, the machine guns on both sides suddenly rang out, causing the Yan's troops to turn around and run wildly. Jia Mao Hou led the work team to chase them for three miles, capturing one alive and seizing one rifle.
    They returned in triumph and arrived at ×× village just in time for a performance. The villagers told them that two Yan's puppet secret agents from Rencun were also watching the performance. They captured the two agents on the spot, removing a great scourge for ×× village.
    Jia Mao Hou's work team went to Bianyan × village to cover the autumn harvest. All the men and women in the village rushed to harvest more than 100 mu in one day. When the harvest was almost complete, gunshots were heard from Fancun. Jia Mao Hou immediately led the work team back to Fancun, but when they arrived at ×× village, they found that 85 enemies were looting grain in the village. He quickly set up a formation and surrounded the enemy from all sides. Zhang Ronghu, who was fourteen years old, threw several hand grenades, killing three enemies and seizing a cart.
    The next day, more than 300 Yan's puppet troops gathered to attempt revenge, and fiercely attacked our Fancun. Jia Mao Hou calmly and cleverly directed the battle. He would fire a machine gun for a while, and then whistle for a while. From 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., the enemy's seven charges were repelled. In this battle, three enemies were killed and eight, including the village chief, were wounded. After the battle, the masses rushed to deliver soup and pancakes to comfort the heroes.
    After this battle, Jia Mao Hou knew that the enemy would never give up. He quickly told the masses to hide their grain well. Sure enough, on October 31st, the "Love the Homeland Corps" of Taigu and the Village Governance Team of Rencun, with more than 200 people, launched another major attack on Fancun. Jia Mao Hou led the militia to quickly bury landmines in various places in the village, and then covered the masses to move outside the village. The enemy, with high arrogance, rushed into the village and saw that it was empty. Just as they were wondering, they stepped on a landmine in the center of the street, blowing up two enemies. A group of enemies pushed open the door and entered the courtyard, wanting to loot, but four landmines exploded again, blowing seven enemies into pieces. This time, the enemy was frightened and quickly retreated. After Mao Hou returned to the village, he seized the opportunity to explain the landmine warfare to the masses in detail, telling them to learn how to bury landmines.
    Jia Mao Hou's eagle-catching-rabbit tactics are well-known in the Taihang area. His work team created a brilliant record of one-to-twenty-six, earning the commendation of the military sub-district. At the Second Taihang Heroes Congress, he was elected as the first-class enemy-killing hero, becoming a banner of guerrilla warfare in the entire region.

　　贾毛猴和范村民兵武工队
    王伯英
    这个一千五百多户的范村镇，是北达太原府南通潞安的一个重要市镇。日寇统治时期，曾把范村当成太谷平川控制我太行区的咽喉。但就在这个时期，贾毛猴已在当地组织地下活动，经常把范村敌伪的情报供给八路军。八年来，太谷人民能在日寇残酷扫荡下，坚持胜利的斗争，得力于他们的帮助是不小的。
    反攻开始后，贾毛猴和他的伙伴们配合八路军解放了范村。这支地下军就变成公开的范村民兵队。但统治山西三十多年的土皇帝——阎锡山又想奴役范村的人民，不断向那儿进犯，贾毛猴的民兵队就起来和阎伪斗争，一次次地歼灭了小股出扰的敌人，负起保卫家乡的光荣任务。
    去年十月，阎顽侵占了距范村十多里的×庄，四出抢粮、抓丁，贾毛猴×夜带领了民兵队去袭扰×庄，打了数十枪，扔了几个手榴弹，敌人胆怯地躲在乌龟壳里乱打了一夜机枪，白耗敌人子弹数千发。隔了六天，×庄阎伪又来抢粮，走到××村被贾毛猴的武工队一个迎头痛击，毙敌连长一名，伤四名。敌人恼羞成怒，猛烈反冲，贾毛猴不幸负伤。一个民兵要背他退出战场，他坚决地说：“这样情况可不能离开。”仍忍着痛指挥作战，终把敌人击退，群众未受到一点损失。
    为了收复失地和保卫周围村庄，贾毛猴将附近村庄的民兵队组织起轮番出击队，常在任村（离阎伪据点很近）活动出击。只要贾毛猴的队伍活动的地方，“治村工作队”（阎伪的武装特务队）就不敢露头。但贾毛猴却老想找机会痛击，“治村工作队”。
    有一天，他到任村去探动静，村长（阎特）问他：“你们的机枪为啥打点发，是不是坏了？”贾毛猴猜他话中有因，故意说：“就是不能连发了。”村长又问：“你们还住几天？”贾毛猴识破了他的阴谋。装着不知说：“我们明天就解散。”村长立刻跑去报告敌人，想将贾毛猴武工队斩草除根。贾毛猴心里有数，次日将队伍故意带到××村耍了半天，他才给大家说明计划，布好伏击阵势。果然××治村工作队大胆地奔来了，当逼近××村时，两边的机枪突然响起来，打得阎军扭头乱跑，贾毛猴带着武工队一直追了三里，活捉一个，缴步枪一枝。
    他们凯旋归来，到××村正赶上唱戏，老乡告诉他们任村的两个阎伪密探也在看戏，他们当场将两个特务捕捉，为××村除了大害。
    贾毛猴武工队去边沿×村掩护秋收，全村男女一天抢割完一百余亩，快收完时，范村传来了枪声，贾毛猴立刻带武工队赶回范村，但到××村时，已发现敌八十五名在村抢粮，他迅速布好阵势，将敌四面包围，十四岁的张荣虎，猛扔几个手榴弹，毙敌三名，缴大车一辆。
    次日，阎伪军集结三百余人企图报复，猛攻我范村，贾毛猴沉着机敏地指挥，他一会打打机枪，一会儿吹口哨，从上午十时一直打到下午七时，敌人七次冲锋都被击退。是役毙敌三名、伤敌村长以下八名。战斗结束，群众争着挑汤送饼，慰劳英雄。
    这次战斗后，贾毛猴知道敌人决不会干休。他赶紧叫群众藏好粮食。果然，十月三十一日，太谷“爱乡团”与任村治村队二百余人，又大举进攻范村。贾毛猴率领民兵很快地在村里各处埋好地雷，然后掩护群众转移村外，气焰高涨的敌人猛扑进村，一看空无一人，正在疑虑之际，踏响了街心地雷，炸倒两个敌人。一群敌人推门进院，正想抢掠，四个地雷又开了花，七个敌被炸得血肉横飞，这下敌人可吓慌了，就赶快撤退。毛猴回村后，抓紧对群众细讲地雷战，叫他们个个要学会埋雷。
    贾毛猴的鹰抓兔战术在太行区是很有名的，他的武工队创造一比二十六的辉煌战绩，博得军分区表扬，在太行二届群英大会上，他被选为第一等杀敌英雄，成为全区游击战争的一面旗帜。
