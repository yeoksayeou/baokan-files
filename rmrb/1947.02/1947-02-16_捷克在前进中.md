　　Czechoslovakia Marches Onward
    English Communist Party General Secretary Bolite

    Labor is Glorious and Great
    The Prague district is an important center of heavy industry in Czechoslovakia. Many important iron factories, mines, and various light industries are concentrated here. The Czech workers call it the black of Kalanuo. But as soon as you step into the city, you will feel that the political movement in the district is red. It is the birthplace of Weinose, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Czech government and one of the Czech Communist Party leaders who is warmly loved by the Czech people. As you step into the city, many workers will come forward and tell you: "This is Comrade Weinose's hometown!" One worker asked me to allow him to take me to visit the place where Comrade Weinose used to work, which has four thousand Communist Party members. The steel industry throughout Czechoslovakia has been nationalized. When I stepped into the steel mill for less than two minutes, I had already discovered some special facts of particular significance to our England. I felt that all the workers had a special enthusiasm for their work, and they all unanimously expressed that this steel mill was their common glory. The workers' unparalleled enthusiasm is specifically reflected in the following moving slogans. "Increase production to ensure the great state-owned plan" and "Produce more and better steel for our republic" are slogans posted all around the factory. These slogans are not just promotional and appealing tricks, but have been transformed into iron facts by the workers' active labor. When the German fascist bandits ruled the Kalanuo Steel Factory, they prepared 350 managers, engineers, and supervisors. But now the entire factory has only eight managers, engineers, and supervisors, and the efficiency of work is constantly improving.
    I once went to visit a modern factory that manufactures electric wires. When the manager of the factory led me to visit various departments of the factory, he confidently said to me: "I am guiding you to visit the most modern factory for a democratic Czechoslovakia." This positive, confident, and happy mood can be seen everywhere.
    I also saw the same emotional expression in the large-scale Benas mine. At the entrance stands a simple and solemn monument. It was built to commemorate the twenty-three outstanding Communist Party members who were taken away from here and shot during the fascist rule. Many fragrant flowers were planted around the monument. The workers throughout the mine will always commemorate these sacrificed workmates and comrades with practical actions.
    The mine shaft entrance of the mine looks like an elegant office hall. The spaciousness and cleanliness of the machine room are unprecedented to me. I think if our miners had the opportunity to see the workers at the Benas mine go to that exquisite X-ray treatment room for X-ray irradiation after taking a shower, they would definitely doubt whether this is a fairyland in a dream or the real situation of a mine.

  Workers and Peasants Unite as One
    In Prague, I went to visit the Zibuluoyueka factory. The famous Bren gun was invented and manufactured here. This factory employs a total of nine thousand workers, of which three thousand seven hundred and fifty are Communist Party members. Now, this factory is manufacturing tractors on a large scale. The enthusiasm and self-confidence revealed on the workers' faces are inspiring. The factory instructor told me in detail that after the factory was nationalized, the atmosphere in the factory immediately turned to a rapid development in a positive direction. Production continues to increase, and many batches of tractors have been sent to farms in various places to help promote the increase in production movement. The factory's technical workers will often tell you how to organize volunteer shock brigades to go to farms in various regions on Sundays to help farmers repair farming tools or tractors. They believe that this is the most glorious job for them.
    In Czechoslovakia, all banks, private insurance companies, mines, and various basic and important industries have been nationalized. Czechoslovakia's state-owned laws include 70 percent of the country's various important industries and enterprises. The Czech working masses are very active and excited about the revival work because they deeply understand that the new Czechoslovakia is built on the basis of new democracy.

    The Czech Communist Party and the People are United as One
    This spirit was even more strongly expressed at the Eighth National Congress of the Czech Communist Party. To celebrate the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Czech Communist Party, the miners of Aoshidalawa specially sent their delegation to report to the congress: "On March 24, 1,200 Communist Party miners worked eight hours extra. They produced 15,000 tons of coal more for the republic and gave all their wages for that day to the party. The miners in the Kalanuo district did two extra working days for the democratic republic. At the same time, the textile workers in the district worked extra for several working days. They unanimously handed over the extra wages to the Minister of Agriculture to relieve a completely destroyed rural area." The delegation of workers from the Konev factory reported to the party's National Congress: "In order to commemorate the implementation of the state-owned plan and wish the party's National Congress a success, our workers brothers throughout the factory have made eight more trucks of telegraph paper and various machines on this day." The workers in the iron and steel industry made 400 tons of various tools more on this day and handed them over to the government for transfer to residents of villages and towns affected by disasters. All the workers in the Boldina steel industry have worked 20,000 working hours extra. They donated all the total harvest of these working hours to the state (I personally saw them do an extra job in order to achieve this goal). In order to strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants, the workers of the Zibuluoyueka factory donated two tractors to the nearby rural areas. All the workers of the Baja Shoe Factory have decided to work one more shift on March 31, and the miners in the Bulun area have also donated all the extra 140,000 working hours to the government. In short, these exciting examples are countless in all regions of Czechoslovakia. I saw the reconstruction of the new democratic Czechoslovakia. I deeply felt that the Czech people have unparalleled confidence and enthusiasm for their bright future. I unhesitatingly affirm that only the existence of an unprecedentedly strong and prestigious Communist Party can make these miracles become iron facts.

  The Czech Communist Party, Tempered Through Hardship
    The Czech Communist Party is the strongest political party in the country. It plays a major leading role in the construction of the new Czechoslovakia. It is prepared to strive for the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party to obtain the vast majority of national votes in the general election in May (this point has been successfully achieved by the Czech Communist Party - Editor).
    The chairman of the Czech Communist Party is the famous Comrade Kliman and Gottwald. When he appeared at the Party's National Congress, the enthusiastic cheers and applause were something that I rarely had the opportunity to see. At the congress, he excellently and specifically clarified the Party's political program and briefly explained the great significance of national unity, revival construction, and increased production. He shouted loudly: Our Party's slogan is "Intensify production for a democratic republic." This slogan has been repeatedly proven not to be sudden.
    When reviewing the history of the Czech Communist Party's struggle over the past ten years, Comrade Slansky, the General Secretary of the Czech Communist Party, reported to the National Congress: "Among the fifty members of the Central Committee of the Party in 1936, eighteen have been shot by the Nazis, sixteen have died in concentration camps everywhere, and four have been forced into exile abroad. Among all the members of the second Central Committee of the Party, fourteen have made heroic sacrifices in the course of battle. Hitler's fascist bandits have shot a total of 25,000 party members at all levels, and 60,000 have been captured and sent to concentration camps."
    Slansky finally said: "In the past, we have paid a heavy price and shed an infinite amount of blood. Now, we will do everything in our power to actively work for the construction of a democratic republic."

  Communist Party Rally in Prague
    The Czech Communist Party has 100,000 party members in the Prague area alone. When they want to convene a mass rally, they must gather on the lawn near the city auditorium. During the uprising in May 1945, many of the most intense battles were launched in this place. Therefore, this large lawn is invisibly equal to the Red Square of the Czech people in the future.
    The Prague district Communist Party decided to hold a rally on this large lawn on March 29. The three purposes of convening the mass rally are: (1) To listen to the report on the achievements of expanding the party movement. (2) To welcome the delegates from all over the country who attended the Eighth National Congress of the Czech Communist Party. (3) To welcome the representatives of fraternal parties from Britain, France, Spain, Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark who came to participate in the Party's Eighth National Congress.
    At 5:30 in the afternoon on that day, the streets in all directions of the city of Prague could see the vast workers' teams moving in an orderly manner towards the large lawn. Magnificent brass bands led each very long workers' team! And among the ranks of the teams fluttered countless bright and splendid Czech national flags, red flags, and flags of various trade union organizations. The district representatives of the Czech Communist Party National Congress, the entire members of the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party, and the representatives of fraternal parties from various countries also formed a magnificent team, gathering towards the vast lawn. The vast lawn has a total of six entrances. Everywhere, you can see the great workers' teams entering the lawn in an orderly and disciplined manner, concentrating at the locations that have been planned in advance. The Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party and the representatives of fraternal parties from various countries took their seats on the platform. Behind the platform fluttered countless long and narrow red flags. At this time, the entire large lawn had been packed with countless workers' masses. Someone reported to the stage: "There is still a worker team that is one mile long outside that has no way to enter the large lawn."
    They have prepared to report the detailed situation of the conference to the entire city of Prague and the other six smaller lawns in Prague that are already full of masses. We listened to the detailed reports on the conference situation from the open-air broadcasting machine.
    At this time, it was already dark. Suddenly, the searchlight beams emitted from the surrounding buildings of the large square surrounded the entire lawn. It was indeed an unparalleled magnificent and beautiful scene. The fierce searchlight beams illuminated the "sea of faces", illuminated thousands of bright red flags fluttering in the wind. I have never seen such a great and exciting scene in my life. Countless Czech national flags and Communist Party red flags are intimately crossed. This scene symbolizes the great future of the new democratic Czechoslovakia.
    Dozens of brass bands simultaneously played the Czech national anthem. In an instant, everyone quickly took off the hats on their heads. Everyone sang the songs they respected and loved with excitement and loud voices. After singing the Czech national anthem, the entire audience immediately fell silent again. Immediately following was the playing of the Soviet national anthem. The songs of the 100,000 masses resounded through the clouds, spreading to the distant west.
    After singing the Soviet national anthem, the 100,000 masses immediately began to cheer rhythmically and consistently towards their Communist Party leaders, like roaring waves. It reminded me of a sentence written by William Rist: Like the roaring tide of the ocean that is about to be stormed!
    The speeches began. Each person's speech was answered with thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers from the masses. Together with Jacques Duclos of France, Litsalais of Greece, Andeng of Spain, General Kosman of Yugoslavia, and a Bulgarian comrade, I was invited to represent the British Communist Party and the British workers and peasants to speak to the conference. I hope I have not tarnished the party. The mood was indeed pleasant, if you know what I mean—when I was able to hear the crowd shouting "Long live Bolite" as I ended my speech, because in past gatherings of the same nature, I have from time to time heard other opinions from the crowd.
    Comrade Nobak was responsible for ending the conference. The national anthems of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia immediately resounded through the clouds again through the throats of thousands of masses. After a moment of silence, the tune of the Internationale immediately broke through the surroundings of the lawn, spreading to the entire Czechoslovakia, spreading to the hearts of every oppressed person. I have never heard such a magnificent and magnificent song as I have seen here. Full facts two days later proved that every family and every street in Prague had listened in detail to the proceedings of the conference.
    After singing the Internationale, the long workers' teams began to gradually move out of the field in an orderly manner again. The marching masses held up tens of thousands of torches, illuminating the surroundings. The entire scene of the march was indeed great and moving. Especially when the march had not yet begun, the masses had raised the huge statues of Stalin and Gottwald high and walked straight through the center of the large square, making everyone feel a real excitement of revolutionary enthusiasm.
    What great strength and iron-like unity is reflected in such a great gathering! It proves that the Czech Communist Party is an invincible force in the lives of the Czech people. At the same time, this is an unparalleled powerful answer to those reactionaries who still dream that reactionary forces will rise again in Czechoslovakia. This is truly a great experience that will never be forgotten. (End)

### 捷克在前进中
波立特

　　捷克在前进中
    英共总书记  波立特
    劳动是光荣伟大的
    普拉格区是捷克重工业的重要中心地。许多重要的铁厂、矿场，和各种轻工业都集中在这里。捷克的工人把它叫做黑色的卡拉诺。但是当你一踏入该城市里，你便会觉得该区的政治运动是赤色的。它是维诺色氏的出生地。他是捷克政府的内政部长，同时也是捷克人民所热烈爱戴的捷共领袖之一。当你踏入该城时，就会有许多工人走上前来告诉你：“这是维诺色同志的家乡！”有一个工人曾要求我允许他带我去参观过去维诺色同志曾工作过的地方，其中有四千名是共产党员。捷克全国的钢铁工业已实行收归国营。当我踏入该制钢厂尚未满二分钟时，我已经发现了一些对我们英国具有特别重大意义的特殊事实。我觉得所有的工人对工作都已有特别的热情，而且他们都一致表示这个制钢工厂是他们的共同光荣。工人的无比热情通过下述的动人标语具体的反映出来了。“提高生产来保障伟大的国营计划”，“为我们的共和国生产更多更好的钢铁”等标语，贴满了工厂的四周。这些标语不只是宣传和号召的花样，而且已被工人的积极劳动转变为铁的事实。当德国法西斯匪徒统治卡拉诺制钢工厂时，他们备用了三百五十个经理、工程师和监工。但是现在全厂只有八个经理、工程师和监工，而且工作的效率却能不断提高。
    我曾经去参观一个现代化的制造电线的工厂。当该厂的经理引导我参观该厂的各种工作部门时，他很自信的对我说道：“我正在引导你参观对民主捷克最摩登的工厂”。这种积极、自信和快乐的情绪是到处可以看到的。
    在规模宏大的贝奈斯矿，我也看到同样的情绪表现。在入门的地方树立着一个简单而庄严的纪念碑。它是为了纪念法西斯统治时代从这里抓去枪毙的二十三位优秀共产党员而建立的。纪念碑的周围种植了许多芬芳的鲜花。全矿场的工人将永远用实际行动来纪念他们这些牺牲了的工友和同志。
    矿场的矿井口很像一个雅致的办公堂。机器房的宽敞和整洁程度是我从来所未见过的。我想，假如我们的矿工有机会看到贝奈斯矿场的工人在洗澡后前往那个精美的Ｘ光治疗室照射Ｘ光的情形时，他们一定会怀疑这是否梦里的仙境或是一个矿场的真实情形。
  工人和农民团结一致
    在布拉格，我曾去参观兹布罗约卡工厂。有名的布连枪就是在这里发明和制造的。这间工厂总共备用九千个工人，其中有三千七百五十名是共产党员。现在，这间工厂正在大规模的制造牵引机。工人脸上表露出来热情和自信心是令人感奋的。工厂的指导员曾详细告诉我，在该厂归国营后，工场里的空气立即转向积极方面迅速发展。生产不断的增加，而且有许多批的牵引机已被派到各地的农场去帮助推进增产运动了。工厂里的技术工人常常会告诉你怎样组织志愿的突击队在星期日到各地区的农场去义务帮助农民修理耕耘工具或牵引机。他们认为这是他们最光荣的一件工作。
    在捷克，所有的银行，私人的保险公司，矿场和各种基本的重要工业都已实行收归国有。捷克的国营法令包括了国内各种重要工业和企业的百分之七十。捷克的工人大众对复兴工作非常积极和兴奋；因为他深刻了解新捷克是建设在新民主主义的基础上。
    捷克共产党和人民打成一片
    在捷克共产党第八届全国代表大会里更加强烈的表现出这种精神。为了庆祝捷共第八届全国代表大会的召开，奥士打拉瓦的矿工曾特派他们的代表团去面告大会道：“在三月二十四日，一千二百个共产党矿工曾多做了八小时工作。他们多产了一万五千吨的煤送给共和国，同时把他们当天的工资全部献给党。卡拉诺区的矿工曾为了民主共和国而义务的多做了两个工作日的工作。同时该区的纺织工人曾多做了好几个工作日。他们一致把额外的工资交给农业部长去救济一个完全遭受破坏的农村。”科尼夫工厂工人代表团曾向党的代表大会报告道：“为了纪念国营计划的推行和预祝党代表大会的胜利，我们全厂的工人兄弟已在这一日多制了八卡车的电报纸和各种机械。”制铁工业的工人在这一日多制了四百吨的各种工具交给政府转送各受灾害的村镇居民。波尔狄纳钢铁工业全部工人已多做了两万个工作小时。他们把这些工作小时的总收获全部赠送给国家（我曾经亲眼看见他们为了达到这个目的而多做了一项工作）。为了加强工人和农民的联盟，兹布罗约卡厂的工人曾赠送两架牵引机给附近的农村。拔佳鞋厂的全部工人已决定在三月三十一日多做一班工，同时布伦区的矿工也把额外的十四万个工作小时全部收获赠送给政府。总之，这种令人兴奋的例子在全捷克各地区是算不完的。我看到了新民主捷克的再建。我深切的感觉到捷克人民对他们自己的光明前途具有无比的信心和热望。我毫不犹豫的肯定：只有存在着一个空前强大和有威信的共产党，才能够使这些奇迹成为铁的事实。
  苦炼成钢的捷克共产党
    捷克共产党是全国最强大的政党。它对新捷克的建设起着主要的领导作用。它准备在五月间的大选过程中争取共产党和社会民主党获得全国选举票的绝大多数（这一点捷共已经胜利的达到——编者）。
    捷共的主席是著名的克里曼、哥德瓦特同志。当他在党的代表大会出现时，喝彩和鼓掌的热烈情形是我自己所很少有机会看见的，他在大会上用优异的方法具体地阐明了党的政治纲领并扼要的说明了民族团结，复兴建设和增加生产的重大意义。他大声疾呼的说道：我们党的口号是“为民主共和国而加紧生产”。这个口号已一再被证明并不是突然的。
    在检讨捷共这十年来的奋斗历史时，捷共的总书记斯兰士基同志向代表大会报告道：“在一九三六年的党中央委员会的五十个中委当中，有十八位已被纳粹枪杀，有十六位死在各处的集中营里面，而且还有四位被迫流亡国外。在第二次的党中央委员会的全部中委当中，有十四位在战斗过程中作了英勇的牺牲。希特勒法西斯匪徒曾总共枪杀了二万五千名各级的党员，而且还有六万名曾被捉进集中营里去。”
    斯兰士基最后说：“过去我们曾付出了惨重的代价，洒了无限量的热血。现在，我们将尽所有的力量，为民主共和国的建设而积极工作。”
  普拉格城的共产党集会
    捷克共产党单单在普拉格区就拥有十万党员。当他们要召开一个群众大会时，他们必须在市礼堂附近草场集合。在一九四五年五月间的起义，曾经在这个地方展开了许多次最猛烈的战斗。所以，这个大草场无形中已等于捷克人民将来的红场。
    普拉格区的共产党曾决定在三月二十九日在这个大草场召开一个大会。召开群众大会的三个目的是：（一）听取关于扩大党运动的成绩报告。（二）欢迎出席捷共第八届全国代表大会的各地代表。（三）欢迎由英国、法国、西班牙、波兰、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、荷兰、比利时、瑞典和丹麦前来参加党第八届代表大会的各国兄弟党的代表。
    在当天下午五点半的时候，普拉格城四面八方的街道，都可以看到在走向大草场有秩序的前进的广大的工人队伍。雄壮的铜乐队前导着每一个很长的工人队伍！而在队伍之行列间则飘扬着无数光明灿烂的捷克国旗，红旗和各职工团体的旗帜，捷共代表大会的各区代表，捷共中央委员会的全体委员和各国兄弟党代表也共同组成一个雄壮的队伍，向广大的草场集合。广大的草场一共有六个进口处。到处都能看见伟大的工人队伍有秩序和有纪律的走进草场，到事先已经有计划地分配好的地点去集中。捷共中央委员会和各国兄弟党的代表到讲台上坐定了自己的席位。讲台的后面，飘扬着无数狭长的红旗。在这个时候，整个的这大草场，已经被无数的工人群众塞得水泄不通。有人向台上报告说：“外面还有一个长达一英里的工人已经没有办法进入大草场。”
    他们已准备将大会的经过情形向全普拉格城外和普拉格城内的其他六个较小的草场也已经塞满了群众。我们听取露天的播音机对大会情形的详细报告。
    这时候，天已经暗了。突然间，由大广场周围的建筑物发射出来的探照灯光包围了整个草场，那实在是一个无比拟的雄壮和美丽的场面。猛烈的探照灯光，照亮了“人脸的海”，照亮了几千面随风飘扬的鲜红旗帜。我一生从来未曾看见过这样一个伟大和令人兴奋的场面。无数的捷克国旗和共产党的红旗都亲密的交叉着。这种情景象征着新民主捷克的伟大前途。
    几十个铜乐队同时吹奏着捷克国歌。一霎那间，所有的人都迅速的脱下了头上的帽。每一个人都以兴奋的心情和宏亮的嗓子唱着他们所尊敬和心爱的歌。唱完了捷克国歌，全场又立即肃静下来。立即跟着而来的是吹奏苏联国歌。十万群众的歌响彻了云霄，传播到遥远的西方。
    唱完了苏联国歌后，十万群众立即开始一致向他们的共产党领袖不时有节奏地欢呼，好象怒吼的波涛一样。它使我记起威廉里士所写的这样一句话；好象暴风雨将要到来的海洋的怒潮奔腾！
    演讲开始了。每个人的演讲都获得群众掌声如雷和热烈欢呼的回答。和法国的雅克斯杜克罗斯，希腊的莱查莱士，西班牙的安登，南斯拉夫的哥斯曼将军与一个保加利亚的同志在一起，我被邀请代表英国共产党和英国工农大众向大会演讲。我希望我未曾玷辱了党。情绪的确是愉快的，假如你了解我的意思的话—当我在结束我的演讲辞时，能够听到全场的群众欢呼着“波立特万岁”的时候，因为在过去同样性质的集会里，我曾经不时听见过别种的群众意见。
    诺巴克同志负责结束了大会。苏联和捷克的国歌又立即通过千万群众的歌喉响彻了云霄。在一霎那的肃静之后，国际歌的声调又立即冲破了草场的四周，传播到全捷克，传播到每一个被压迫者的心灵。我从来没有听见过这样雄伟和壮丽的歌，象我在这里所见到的一样。在两天后充分的事实证明普拉格的每个家庭和每条街道都曾经详细的聆听着大会的经过情形。
    在唱完国际歌后，绵长的工人队伍又开始有秩序的向场外逐渐移动。游行的群众高举起整千整万支火把，照耀了四周。整个游行的情景的确是伟大动人的。尤其是当游行还没有开始的时候，群众曾高高举起斯大林和哥德瓦特的巨像直穿过大广场的中央，使每一个人都感觉到一阵真正的革命热情的激动。
    这样伟大的一个集会反映出多么伟大的力量和钢铁般的团结！它证明了捷克共产党在捷克人民的生活中是一个无敌的势力。同时，对于那些还梦想反动力量会再在捷克抬头的反动分子，这是一个无比有力的回答。这真是一个永远不会忘记的伟大经验。（完）
