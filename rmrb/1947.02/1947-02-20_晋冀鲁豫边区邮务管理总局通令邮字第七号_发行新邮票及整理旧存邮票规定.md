Circular Postal No. 7 of the General Bureau of Postal Administration of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region
Regulations on the Issuance of New Stamps and Sorting of Existing Stamps

To all District, City, County Bureau Chiefs, Station Masters, Agency Offices, and Sales Outlets:

It is hereby stipulated that starting from February 1st, new stamps bearing the portrait of Chairman Mao will be issued, with denominations of two yuan (brown), ten yuan (green), twenty yuan (red), and thirty yuan (dark blue). The sample stamps received by the General Bureau should be immediately transferred to all bureaus and stations, and kept safe for verification.

Last year, due to the large-scale alteration of stamps, the variety of stamp denominations became excessive, resulting in considerable confusion in stamp issuance and significantly affecting business operations. In order to overcome this phenomenon and improve operations, the following measures are stipulated for sorting existing stamps:

1.  Based on the policy of expanding business and increasing revenue, all levels of bureaus and stations should regard actively expanding business scope and promoting stamp sales as a primary daily task and make diligent efforts; and should prioritize selling existing altered stamps, so as to reduce them as quickly as possible. In order to overcome the confusion as early as possible, it is stipulated that for similar stamps (stamps of the same face value), if there are any altered stamps in stock, old stamps will not be sold. This point should be strictly observed.

2.  From May 1st, all altered stamps (including those altered by the General Bureau and those altered by the Taihang and Taiyue regions) will be uniformly discontinued from circulation and sale in the Jinan and Taiyue regions. All bureaus, districts, and stations should be responsible for selling off as much of the altered stamps as possible before April 30th, according to the provisions of item one. Those that cannot be sold by the deadline should be collected and returned to the General Bureau before the end of April, and must not be sold again. In short, from May 1st onwards, any mail found to have altered stamps affixed in the Jinan and Taiyue regions will be treated as underpaid. The altered stamps from last year may only be circulated and used within the Taihang and Ji-Lu-Yu regions from now on. All mail sent from the border region to other regions must have new stamps affixed to be valid.

3.  The temporary stamps issued by the Ji-Lu-Yu region should be discontinued and invalidated from May 1st to ensure uniformity.

4.  Recently, counterfeit stamps have been continuously appearing in various places. All levels of bureaus, stations, and offices should pay close attention to distinguishing authenticity. From now on, anyone found to have counterfeited or altered stamps should be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrator immediately handed over to judicial authorities for punishment. If the offender is a staff member, the judicial authorities should be notified on the one hand, and the person in charge of the work unit should be informed by letter on the other hand, so that administrative and legal sanctions can be imposed to serve as a warning and maintain law and discipline. The situation should be reported to the General Bureau in detail at any time; and the already sent mail should be handled as underpaid.

5.  In the Jinan and Taiyue regions, any senders who have altered stamps in stock should exchange them for new stamps at various post offices and stations before the end of April. Those who have Ji-Lu-Yu temporary stamps in stock should also go to all levels of post offices and stations in the entire border region to exchange them for new stamps before the end of April. Expired exchanges will not be allowed, but temporary stamps will only be allowed to be exchanged and recovered within the time limit, and must not be affixed for use again. The Ji-Lu-Yu temporary stamps received in exchange in the Jinan, Taihang, and Taiyue regions can be handed over to the General Bureau for exchange for new stamps and must not be sold or used.

You are required to comply with the above provisions and publish this order in local newspapers so that the public is aware and it is conducive to implementation.

This order.

    以上各节仰即遵照办理，并应将本令在各地报纸发表，俾众周知，而利执行为要。  此令
