(From our newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 25th) In the process of implementing land reform, various counties have discovered that many overthrown despotic landlords have concealed the fruits of struggle. Liu Lao Jue, a landlord from Sijiali in Yanggu, buried 20 large and small silver ingots, totaling 600 taels, 2,600 silver dollars, 230 catties of copper coins, 200 catties of cash, and 120 pieces of clothing. When Chu Yushan, a landlord from Fanzhuang, was struggled against last year, he only handed over dozens of mu of land. This time, the masses settled old scores with him, and he said to the masses, "I don't have much else, only eighteen dan of grain. I don't have anything else, and I won't lie." The masses did not believe him and, as a result, unearthed more than a hundred dan of grain and two large vats of silk clothing. On the dawn of February 6th, Wang Hanlin, a landlord from Wangsha in Yuncheng First District, put a shed on his cart, hung quilts on both ends, and pretended to be marrying off a daughter, but inside were seven leather suitcases full of valuables. He was intercepted by the masses on the way and has been handed over to the Farmers' Association for processing.

　　冀鲁豫各地揭破地主欺骗狡计
    挖出大量隐蔽资财
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】各县贯彻土地改革中发现许多被斗恶霸地主掩藏斗争果实。阳谷四甲里地主六老绝，埋藏大小元宝二十个共六百两，现洋两千六百元，铜元二百三十斤，制钱二百斤，衣服一百二十件。范庄地主楚玉善去年被斗时只拿出几十亩地，这次群众向他清算老账，他对群众说：“我多了没有，只有十八石粮食，别的东西一点也没有了，我不会说瞎话。”群众听了不相信，结果挖出粮食百多石，绸缎衣服两大缸。郓城一区王沙地主王汉林，二月六日拂晓把大车扎上棚，两头挂着被子，假装娶亲内载皮箱七个，尽是贵重物品，途中被群众查获，已交农会处理。
