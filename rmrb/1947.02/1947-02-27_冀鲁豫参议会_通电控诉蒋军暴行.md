　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Provisional Assembly
    Cables Denouncing Atrocities by Chiang's Troops
    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan bureau, 25th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Provisional Assembly sent a cable to the whole country, denouncing the atrocities of Chiang's troops. The original text reads: "To all compatriots across the country: The traitor Chiang is selling out the country and acting dictatorially, starting a civil war and making himself the enemy of the people of the whole country. In our Third and Fifth Special Administrative Regions, under the poison of puppet bandits, evil-doers, and hooligans, over ten thousand people have been brutally murdered, while acts of rape, looting, arson, and forced conscription are countless. Families of those resisting [the Japanese] have been slaughtered, martyrs' tombs have been destroyed, and twelve-year-old members of children's corps and thirteen-year-old members of sister corps have been subjected to abuse. Peaceful residents have suffered the horrors of having their eyes gouged out and their tongues cut off, and after being killed, people are not allowed to cry or bury them. The cruelty and brutality are appalling. The suffering of the people is unparalleled in the world. We, representing the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated areas, accuse [the KMT forces] before compatriots across the country and fair-minded people worldwide, hoping that compatriots across the country and international people of justice will unite in opposing the atrocities of Chiang's troops."

    通电控诉蒋军暴行
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】冀鲁豫参议会通电全国，控诉蒋军暴行。原文称，全国同胞公鉴：蒋贼卖国独裁，发动内战与全国人民为敌。我第三、第五专署区，在伪匪恶棍流氓的荼毒下，被惨杀者达一万以上，而奸淫虏掠烧杀抓丁更难以数计，抗属被屠杀，烈士陵墓被毁，十二岁的儿童团员、十三岁之姊妹团员备受欺凌。和平居民，惨遭挖眼割舌，杀死人不准哭、不准埋。其残忍暴虐骇人听闻。人民遭灾之惨，举世罕见。我们代表冀鲁豫解放区向全国同胞、全世界公正人士控诉，望全国同胞及国际正义人士一致反对蒋军暴行。
