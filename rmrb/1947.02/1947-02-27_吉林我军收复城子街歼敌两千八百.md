Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th: A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated 2,800 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops and recovered the important stronghold of Chengzi Street. The American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek army, the 89th Regiment of the 30th Division of the New First Army, along with one battalion of the 22nd Regiment and the division's directly subordinate mountain artillery battalion, which had occupied Chengzi Street, northeast of Jiutai, Jilin, had been constantly invading and harassing the area. On the morning of February 23rd, the Democratic Allied Army launched a counterattack at 11:00 AM. After eight hours of fierce fighting, all five battalions were annihilated. Two thousand three hundred enemy troops, including Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Shengpu, were captured alive, and a total of 500 were killed or wounded. Sixty-eight American-made rocket launchers and anti-tank guns, one hundred twenty-seven light and heavy machine guns, one hundred sixty-three American-style machine guns, and eight vehicles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st: In the patriotic self-defense war of the first month of this year, the 7th Regiment of a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army had already completed and exceeded its annual plan to eliminate the enemy and render meritorious service. In the battle of Shijia Township in Baonan, each platoon bravely charged into the enemy's courtyard. Squad Leader Jia Yuming continued to fight despite being wounded. Soldier Li Xiangtian pointed his gun at the window and shouted, "Surrender!" and all the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers laid down their weapons. In the Dingxian battle, the platoon captured 181 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop, seizing 95 rifles, 8 light machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, and 2 submachine guns. (Note: The majority of the company were new recruits; they decided at the beginning of January to eliminate 180 enemy soldiers for the whole year.)
