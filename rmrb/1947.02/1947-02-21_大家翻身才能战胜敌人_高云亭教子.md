Everyone Liberated Can Defeat the Enemy
    Gao Yunting Teaches His Son
    Tian Fei

    Gao Yunting is a 52-year-old peasant. At the emancipation heroes' conference in the second district of Tunliu, he was publicly elected as the number one emancipation hero in the entire second district. In the mass movement, he was the most patient person in persuading and helping others to emancipate themselves. He once mobilized a silent person to participate in the struggle thirty-six times, and finally, he succeeded.

    Gao Yunting's son, Gao Shun'er, is a very capable young man, but when the emancipation movement first started, he was very selfish. He himself said: "When my family was first emancipated, I was focused on production, watching over my little bit of property. What about others? What does their emancipation have to do with me? At that time, I was an extremely selfish fellow!" But with the help of his father, Shun'er has now transformed into a hero praised by everyone in the village (former village). When Shun'er initially didn't care about others' emancipation, Gao Yunting called him over and asked him: "Shun'er, is it okay if you only care about your own emancipation and don't care about others' emancipation?" Shun'er casually replied: "We're emancipated ourselves, why bother about others? Useless, just looking for trouble!" After six or seven conversations between father and son, Shun'er's thinking was not changed.

    Gao Shun'er said in his report of his heroic deeds: "I was just such a person, which made my father very angry. He often scolded me unceremoniously, and then persuaded me gently. That's how I changed!"

    Once, the old hero Gao Yunting asked his son Shun'er: "If our family is emancipated, but other families aren't, will that work?" Shun'er answered as he had in the past. This time, Gao Yunting was not at all anxious, and calmly asked again: "Son, if we are emancipated, but many of the basic people are not, will they be willing?" Shun'er was even more stubborn, answering without thinking: "Whether they're willing or not, can our family handle public affairs?" Gao Yunting changed his approach and asked: "If someone wants to hit me today, would you care?" Shun'er said without hesitation: "Of course, I would. What kind of son wouldn't care if someone hit his father?" Gao Yunting felt it was an opportunity and quickly asked: "There are more of them, and fewer of us, what do we do?" Shun'er naturally replied: "Wouldn't I find some neighbors to help me?" The old hero laughed for a while and continued to ask Shun'er: "If people aren't willing to help you, do you have any other way? Can you alone withstand the great traitor Chiang Kai-shek's attack on our liberated areas? Silly child, can each person only take care of their own family and still get things done!" This time, Gao Shun'er's thinking was changed, and he immediately swore to the old hero: "I didn't understand this before. In the future, I will definitely help others emancipate themselves. If our family is emancipated, we must also let everyone be emancipated." Gao Yunting finally carefully exhorted Shun'er: "Help others emancipate themselves, but be careful to choose the right people and don't harm the interests of our basic people."

　　大家翻身才能战胜敌人
    高云亭教子
    田非
    高云亭是五十二岁的老农民，在屯留全二区的翻身英雄大会上，被大家公推为全二区的第一号翻身英雄。在群众运动中，他是一个最肯耐心说服和帮助别人翻身的人，曾经三十六次动员一个不吭气的人参加斗争，最后他是胜利了。
    高云亭的儿子——高顺儿，是一个很精干的青年，但是在起初闹翻身的时候，他却十分自私自利，他自己说：“我家刚翻了身的时候，我就是有心生产，看住我这点点家当。别人呢？翻不翻身和咱有啥相干？我那时是一个顶自私自利的家伙！”可是高顺儿在他老子的帮助下，如今也转变成全村（原村）人称赞的英雄了。当顺儿起初不关心旁人翻身的时候，高云亭把他叫到跟前，问他：“顺儿，你光顾你自己翻身，不管旁人翻身行不行？”顺儿便随口答道：“咱自己翻了身，还管旁人干啥？尿，白找麻烦受！”父子俩经过六七次谈话，也没有打通了顺儿的思想。
    高顺儿在报告他的英雄事迹时，这样说：“我就是这样的一个人，可把我老子气坏啦，他常很不客气的教训我一顿，后来又和和气气的劝说了我一番，这回我才转变啦！”
    有一次，高云亭老英雄问自己的儿子顺儿道：“咱一家翻身，别人家不翻，能行不能行？”顺儿还是和过去一样地回答。高云亭这回可一点也不着急，从从容容地又问道：“孩儿呀，咱翻了身，很多基本人没翻身，他们能愿意吗？”顺儿更顽强了，毫不加思索地答道：“管他愿意不愿意，咱这一家可能办公家的事呢？”高云亭就变了个办法，问道：“今天假如有人要打我，你看管不管呢？”顺儿毫不迟疑的说：“那还能不管，那有打老子当儿的不管的道理呢？”高云亭觉得是机会了，便抢着问道：“人家人多，咱家人少，怎办？”顺儿很自然地答道：“我不会找几家邻居来帮助我吗？”老英雄哈哈地笑了一阵，又继续问顺儿道：“人家不肯帮助你，你再有办法没有？大奸臣蒋介石进攻咱解放区，你一人能顶住吗？傻孩子，各人只管自家还能办了事！”这一下，可把高顺儿的思想打通了，马上对着老英雄宣誓道：“我以前没弄通这件事，以后我一定要帮助别人翻身，咱一家翻了身，也要叫大家翻了身。”高云亭最后又很仔细的叮咛顺儿道：“你帮助别人翻身吧，可要看好对象，不要妨害了咱们基本人的利益。”
