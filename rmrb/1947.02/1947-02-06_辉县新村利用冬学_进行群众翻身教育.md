Xinxiang County's New Village Utilizes Winter School to Conduct Land Reform Education Among the Masses
    Shi Feng
    New Village is a village of 881 people. At the beginning of the movement, the masses were afraid of a change in the political climate. The leading figures of the village's ruling class were not overthrown, and the masses, under threat, dared not speak. The Winter School therefore conducted current affairs education comparing the strengths of the two forces. First, it analyzed the class forces in the village. During the discussion, some people said, "We are not afraid of the local despots and secret agents, but Jiang Jieshi is their backer." Others said, "Except for a few secret agents and despots, who in our village wants the Central Army to come?" "Old Jiang, like the despots in our village, is on a downward slope and will inevitably fail in the end!" "The things that the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party do are for the liberation of the common people." Some, while calculating, said, "Our New Village has 881 people. Except for the 19 targets of struggle, who doesn't support the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party!" This led everyone to calculate: the whole village, the whole district, the whole county, and even the whole of China – how many despots are there, and how many common people are there? After heated discussions, the masses unanimously concluded: "The Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party are working for the people, liberating the poor. All the Chinese people support them, and they are on an upward slope and will surely win in the end!" In this way, the Winter School exposed the bad people's rumors of a change in the political climate, and the secret agent elements began to reveal themselves. The leading figures of the village's ruling class were also overthrown. The masses launched a grievance-airing movement in the Winter School. From the airing of grievances, someone said: Cui Futang and Wang Tai told him that the Central Army was coming, that the Eighth Route Army was no good... These rumors attracted everyone's attention. The masses then discussed why he said "the Central Army is coming, the Eighth Route Army is no good..."? After tracing the root cause, they discovered a secret agent assassination group organization headed by Futang and Wang Tai. The masses began to accuse the secret agents and despots, and denounced the crimes of Wang Tai and Cui Futang, launching a fiery mass movement of "thorough accounting combined with anti-espionage."
    As the movement deepened, it was discovered that cadres and the masses did not clearly understand the meaning of "leveling and filling gaps." Many people thought: "Leveling means making everything flat, and filling gaps means making everything even; however high you want to go, that's how high it should be, and what's uneven should be re-divided." They did not understand whose tail to cut off and whose "gaps" to fill. Therefore, middle peasants were afraid and offered houses and land, and secret agents took the opportunity to exploit the situation.
    At this time, the leadership asked the masses, "Why are middle peasants offering land?" Some people said: "They have figured it out, they are enlightened, and they are willing to do it voluntarily." Others asked: "Why didn't they do it voluntarily when we weren't struggling against them?" "This proves that the middle peasants haven't figured it out, they are afraid of struggle!" Some further questioned: "Why do those without any facts of being despots also offer land?" After discussion, everyone asked: "Whose tail are we cutting off, and whose gaps are we filling in the end?" Only then did the masses understand that they had to cut off the tails of the feudal landlords and continue to struggle and vent their anger against those who had not been thoroughly struggled against. For the middle peasants who had already been struggled against, the cadres and the masses relieved their worries and reassured them, putting forward the slogan "Poor and lower-middle peasants unite tightly, and the struggle for liberation makes us one family." They continued to carry out class demarcation education, making the masses more clear about who was the enemy and who was one of their own. A large number of middle peasants were absorbed into the peasants' association, so that the middle peasants could actually experience that leveling and filling gaps was not a struggle against themselves. The peasants became more united and launched a thorough reckoning with the cunning feudal landlords.
    When distributing the fruits of the struggle, some people advocated equal distribution, and some advocated that whoever made suggestions should get more. Everyone then discussed: "Is overthrowing the despots and liberating ourselves only for a few people, or is it to liberate all the poor?" "Whose strength is it to overthrow the despots? Is it enough to just make suggestions?" After discussion, the idea of liberation for everyone was established. This was then extended to "How should we distribute the fruits of this struggle in order to level and fill gaps?" Most people agreed that the poor should get more. "The poor have been oppressed more in the past, which is equivalent to investing more shares in a cooperative; today, when we overthrow the despots and distribute dividends, the poor should get more." The masses also suggested that more care should be given to the families of soldiers. Finally, the principle was determined to be "first down, then up (that is, first the poor, then the rich), first the masses, then the cadres." Then, appraisal committee members were selected, and the households receiving the fruits were divided into four classes according to wealth, with the families of soldiers being a special class. During the distribution, the masses were first allowed to propose what they wanted, and the distribution was made after appraisal. Any different opinions were resolved by the masses. Cadres were also distributed to various streets to listen to the masses' feedback. There was a sheep that was not distributed fairly, and it was resolved after three reconsiderations by the masses.

    辉县新村利用冬学
    进行群众翻身教育 
    石峰
    新村是八百八十一人的村子。运动一开始，群众怕变天，村里的统治头没有扣起，群众受着威胁，不敢说话。冬学就进行两种力量对比的时事教育：首先分析了本村的阶级力量。在讨论中，有的群众说：“恶霸、特务不害怕，但是人家蒋介石作后台。”也有人说：“咱村除几个特务恶霸以外，谁愿叫中央军来？”“老蒋和咱村恶霸一样，正往下坡路走，最后非失败不可！”“八路军、共产党办的事情是叫老百姓翻身哩。”有的一面计算一面说：“咱新村八百八十一人，除十九个斗争对象外，谁不拥护八路军共产党！”这样引起大家都计算：全村全区全县一直算到全中国，有多少恶霸，有多少老百姓。经过热烈的讨论，群众一致结论：“八路军、共产党是为人民办事，叫穷人翻身的，全中国老百姓都拥护他，正往上坡路走哩，最后一定要胜利！”这样，在冬学里揭发了坏人的变天谣言，特务分子即开始显露出来。村里的统治头亦被扣起。群众在冬学里即展开诉苦运动。从诉苦中有人说：崔福堂、王太对他说中央军要来，八路军不中……等谣音，引起了大家的注意，群众就讨论开他为什么说“中央军要来，八路军不中……”？经过追根后，发现了以福堂、王太为首的特务暗杀团组织。群众开始了对特务恶霸的控诉，控诉王太、崔福堂的罪恶。展开了热火朝天的“清算结合反特”的群众运动。
    运动走向深入的时候，发现干部、群众对“填平补齐”认识不清楚，很多人认为：“填平即是平展展的，补齐即是齐整整哩；要多高都多高，不平的要重分。”不明白割谁的尾巴，补谁的“齐”。所以中农害怕即献房、献田，特务趁机钻空子。
    这时领导上向群众提出“为什么中农献田？”有人说：“人家想通了，觉悟了，愿意自动。”也有人问道：“咱不斗争时候他为啥不自动？”“证明中农不是想通了，是怕斗争哩！”有的又提问：“没有恶霸事实的为啥也要献呢？”经过讨论。大家又问：“倒底割谁尾巴，补谁齐？”群众这才明确要割封建地主的尾巴，没斗透的要继续斗争、出气。对已经被斗了的中农，干部、群众给解圪塔、安心。提出“贫雇中农团结紧，斗争翻身一家人。”继续就进行阶级划分教育，使群众更明确了谁是敌人，谁是一家人。大量吸收中农参加农会，使中农实际体会填平填齐不是斗争自己。农民更加团结，向狡猾的封建地主展开了彻底的清算。
    分配果实的时候，有人主张平均分配，有的主张谁提意见谁得。大家又讨论：“打倒恶霸把身翻，是只少数人翻身，还是叫所有穷人都翻身？”“打倒恶霸是谁的力量，光提意见行不行？”经过讨论，树立了翻身大家翻的思想。再引到“咱们这次斗争果实怎样分，才能填平补齐。”多数人同意穷人多分。“穷人过去受压迫多，就等于合作社入的股多；今天打倒恶霸分红利，穷人就该多分。”群众又提出应多照顾军属。最后确定原则是“先尽下，再尽上（即先穷后富），先尽群众，后尽干部”。然后选出评议委员，把得果实户按贫富分成四等，军属为特等。分配时，先让群众提出自己爱要的东西，经过评议分配。有不同意见由群众解决。干部也分布各街听取群众反映。有一只羊分的不公，又经群众复议三次，获得解决。
