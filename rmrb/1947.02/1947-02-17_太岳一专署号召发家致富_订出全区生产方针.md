Taiyue First Administrative Region Calls for Wealth Generation
Sets Production Policy for the Entire Region

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch dated 15th] The Taiyue First Administrative Region has specifically established a production policy for the Northern Yue region to launch a movement for establishing homes and building wealth after the return of land to the peasants. The focus is on developing mutual aid and cooperation, ensuring the combination of war and production, improving textile production, developing animal husbandry, promoting cotton planting, and striving for "cultivating three and saving one." 1. Produce 240,000 *shi* of coarse grains, restoring pre-war land yields within two years. Increase fertilization, plowing, and hoeing, exchange seeds, and promote superior varieties to guarantee increased production. 2. Improve textile production to complete 27 million *chi* of cloth needed for both military and civilian use. To this end, it is necessary to increase the number of looms by 2,000 and promote 1,000 shuttle-pulling looms. If the existing 20,000 flat looms are insufficient, the number can be increased to this amount. In addition, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of textile production and sales in a planned way. More attention must be paid to organizing to ensure the completion of this task, organizing small training classes, and promoting the technology of shuttle-pulling looms. 3. Develop animal husbandry, increasing the number of livestock by 3,000 head, and developing pig, sheep, and chicken raising. Establish a breeding station in at least every two districts for large-scale breeding and reward model veterinarians. Every village should buy a book on treating livestock diseases. Livestock should not be requisitioned for labor for three months before and after birth. Raising chickens, sheep, and pigs generates considerable income and is also a major source of fertilizer. The general requirement for counties is one pig for every three households, one pig for every five households in Tunliu, and one pig for every ten households in Qin County. Each county should plan for raising chickens and sheep. 4. Plant cotton. The new and existing cotton fields will total 80,000 *mu*.

　　太岳一专署号召发家致富
    订出全区生产方针
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳一专署特订出岳北区生产方针，开展土地还家后的成家立业发家致富运动。重点在发展互助合作，确保战争和生产的结合，提高纺织，发展畜养，推广植棉，争取耕三余一。一、产杂粮二十四万石，在两年内恢复战前土地产量。增肥、多犁、多锄一次，交换种子与推广优良品种，以保证增产。二、提高纺织，完成军民需布二千七百万尺。为此，需增织机两千架，并推广拉梭机一千架，旧有平机如不足两万架，可增到此数。此外必须有计划解决纺织供销困难。更要注意组织起来，保证这一任务完成，组织小型训练班，推广拉梭机的技术。三、发展养畜，增加牲口三千头，并发展养猪、养羊、养鸡。最低每两个区设一配种所，大量配种，奖励模范兽医。每村都买一本家畜病治疗法。牲口胎前产后三个月不支差。养鸡、养羊、养猪收入都很大，也是积肥的主要来源。一般的县要求三户一猪，屯留五户一猪，沁县十户一猪。养鸡、养羊各县计划。四、种植棉花。新增旧有共种棉田八万亩。
