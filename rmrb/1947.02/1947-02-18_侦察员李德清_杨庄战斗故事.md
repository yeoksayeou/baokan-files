　　Reconnaissance Man Li Deqing
    The Story of the Yangzhuang Battle

The enemy's machine gun cut off our follow-up support and blocked the main street ahead. It was like getting shot as soon as you showed your head. To deal with the enemy, we had to take the courtyard to the north first, but what about the machine gun blockade? Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang told the reconnaissance man to find the engineers. Li Deqing said "Okay" and ran off quickly. In less than three minutes, he led three engineers crawling over under intense fire. With a "boom," the north room was blown open. Li Deqing, holding a submachine gun, ran over like an arrow, and swept the enemy back with a burst of fire. He entered the room, grabbed a light machine gun, and shouted happily, "Comrades, come quickly! The enemy has run away, and the machine gun is in my hands." As the troops followed, he searched each room. Before entering a house, he would throw two grenades first. The enemy in the east courtyard attempted to counterattack. Li Deqing threw thirty-two grenades from the roof in one go, scattering the enemy in chaos. Finally, they were forced into a house, and he shouted, "You are surrounded on all sides, surrender your weapons, and the Eighth Route Army will not kill you." An old woman also shouted to the enemy, "Fighting is no use anymore! Surrender your guns, the Eighth Route Army doesn't kill people." Seeing the situation was hopeless, the enemies threw their guns into the yard. The old woman helped carry three light machine guns, three 60mm mortars, and eight rifles, time and time again, and all eighteen enemies became prisoners.

　　侦察员李德清
    杨庄战斗故事
    敌人的机枪卡断了，我们后续的接济，又封锁了前进中的一道大街，简直是一露头就挨打。要想搞敌人，只有先夺取北面那一座院子，但机枪封锁怎么办呢？张副团长叫侦察员去找工兵。李德清说了个“好”字，就飞快的跑去了。不到三分钟，他领着三个工兵在密集的火力下爬过来。“轰隆”一声北房炸开了。李德清端着冲锋枪，箭一样快的跑过去，用枪一扫，把敌人打退。他进房抓住一挺歪把机枪，高兴的喊着：“同志们快来吧。敌人跑了，机枪到了我手里。”部队跟上来，他又到每个房搜索一下。每进一座房子，先打两个手榴弹。东院敌人企图反击。李德清一股劲从房上打过三十二个手榴弹，把敌人打的乱叫乱跑。最后压到一座房子里，他高喊：“四面把你们包围了，缴了枪，八路军不杀你们。”一个老太太也向敌人喊道：“再打不行啦！你们缴枪吧，八路军不杀人。”敌人看情势不对，都把枪丢到院里。老太太帮着一次又一次把三挺歪把机枪、三门六公分炮、八枝步枪抱过来，十八个敌人都当了俘虏。
