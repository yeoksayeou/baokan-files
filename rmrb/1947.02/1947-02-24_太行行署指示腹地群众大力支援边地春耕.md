Taihang Administrative Office Directs Hinterland Masses to Vigorously Support Spring Plowing in Border Areas

[This newspaper, Taihang, 22nd dispatch] The Taihang Administrative Office recently called on the masses in the hinterland of the entire region to support the anti-enemy struggle and mass production in the border areas. The instruction stated: For more than a year, the border areas of Taihang have suffered repeated plundering by the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, with houses reduced to ruins and grain and resources exhausted. In Shouyang, ten villages; in Taigu, fifteen villages; in Pingding, more than thirty villages; in Yuci, sixteen villages; a total of one hundred and fifty villages in Yuanshi, Huolu, Gaoyi, Jingxing and other counties, as well as most of the areas occupied by Chiang's stubborn troops on the west side of the northeast Ping-Han Railway and in the western section of Taihang, have become no-man's-lands. The masses in Qingshan Village, Shouyang, had everything they hid from the Japanese invaders during the eight years of the War of Resistance looted by Yan's troops, and all their livestock and tools were taken away. More than 5,000 people from Beizhuang, Baijing, Baian, Guanzhuang and other villages around the Yan's troops' outposts in Pingding have no clothes or food, and rely entirely on relief. However, our compatriots in the border areas have all armed themselves and fought bravely against the enemy; many people from their fallen homelands have withdrawn with us. The elders of our entire region should uphold the spirit of "the liberated areas are one family," help and love each other. In addition to quickly helping our own brothers settle down and resume production, we should also prepare to support the upcoming struggles in the border areas. For this reason, the following is stipulated: the textile hinterland of the First, Second, and Fifth Special Districts will support the border areas of this special district, and the Third Special District will support the Fourth Special District. This kind of support should continue until the complete end of the self-defense war.

　　太行行署指示腹地群众大力支援边地春耕
    【本报太行二十二日电】太行行署顷号召全区腹地群众，支援边沿区对敌斗争与群众生产。指示称：一年多来，我太行边沿地区遭受蒋伪军的轮番洗劫，房舍为墟，粮资一空。寿阳有十个村，太谷有十五个村，平定有三十余村，榆次有十六个村，元氏、获鹿、高邑、井陉等县共一百五十个村，以及东北平汉西侧与太行西段的大部蒋顽侵占地区，均已变成无人区。寿阳清山村群众，在抗战八年中隐藏而未被日寇抢去的东西，却受阎军悉被抢去，牲畜工具也被劫无余。平定阎军驻点周围之北庄、柏井、白岸、冠庄等村五千余群众，无衣无食，全靠赈济，但我边沿区同胞，无不武装奋起，与敌战斗；有不少家乡沦陷人民，随我撤出。我全区父老应本“解放区一家”精神，互助互爱，除对于自己兄弟，应迅速帮助安家生产外，并准备支援边区即将到来的斗争。为此规定：一、二、五专区纺织腹地支援本专区边地，三专区支援四专区。此种支援，应至自卫战完全结束为止。
