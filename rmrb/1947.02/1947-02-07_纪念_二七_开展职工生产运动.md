    Commemorating the "February 7th" Strike by Launching a Workers' Production Movement
    The great "February 7th" anniversary is approaching, and the vast number of workers in our region are preparing to cooperate with the overall production movement in the region to promote industrial production. Our guiding principle for factory production is to realize Chairman Mao's instructions: "Sufficient raw materials, low cost, high quality, large quantity, and wide sales." Implementing the policy of labor-capital cooperation to develop production and mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm for production to support the front lines is the direction of the workers' movement in our region in 1947.
    Our region has created many experiences in realizing labor-capital cooperation to develop production. Such as labor-capital joint ventures, comprehensive profit sharing (such as small factories in Changzhi and other places), awarding prizes or sharing profits for exceeding the prescribed production standards; increasing wages at the same time if the production standards are generally improved due to improved tools or increased labor intensity; calculating wages by the piece, with more labor resulting in more income; rewarding inventions and creations; and establishing factory management committees to absorb workers' participation, etc., in order to stimulate production upwards. This can improve the workers' sense of responsibility and initiative, and the capitalists are also happy to invest. In the future, we should continue to study ways to improve production, such as promoting economic accounting, cost accounting, etc., in order to further implement the policy of labor-capital cooperation to develop production.
    At present, the lives of workers in the border region have been appropriately improved; in addition to current affairs education, the future direction of struggle should be to strengthen education on new labor viewpoints, technology, production, democracy, and love for the factory, etc., to fully mobilize the workers' consciousness to serve production for the self-defense war. We should also promote respect for teachers and love for apprentices, respect for technology, and mass research on technology and inventions. Among people and factories, we should promote unity, mutual assistance, and common development of production, establish workers' cooperatives, organize workers' families for production, and establish housework.
    The industrial production movement must be a movement of all staff and workers in the entire factory; if only the workers move and the staff does not, the movement will not be successful. In the past, the workers' movement only paid attention to the workers and neglected the mobilization of the staff (or cadres). When the workers were mobilized and production efficiency improved, the supply of raw materials and tools, the storage and sales of finished products, and the organizational system and work style remained stagnant, failing to keep up with the requirements of the movement, thus often affecting the development of the movement. This phenomenon must be corrected. In the future, all staff (including factory directors) and workers should be absorbed into the movement without exception. When the masses have been mobilized and the workers' sense of responsibility has been strengthened, labor and work efficiency will inevitably improve, thus inevitably requiring the streamlining of unnecessary personnel (including staff and workers), changing unreasonable systems, and opposing bureaucratic work styles. The leadership must implement the mass line, and all non-enterprise and bureaucratic institutions, systems, and work styles that hinder the mobilization of the masses of workers should be transformed and discarded. According to the needs of production and the masses, new institutions, systems, and work styles should be built to meet the requirements of comprehensive factory transformation and comprehensive improvement.
    All work related to the movement's planning, competition, inspection, summary, and selection must be carried out by fully mobilizing the masses of workers throughout the factory, relying on the consciousness of the masses, and implementing the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." According to the production and the needs of the masses in the factory, the person in charge and the heroes should take the lead, and all the employees of the factory should make individual plans to improve production in their own positions; then, when they are gathered together, they will become the specific requirements of the entire factory movement. Whether it is a challenge, a response, a summary, or a selection, this should be the standard. Timely summaries, comparisons, and rewards should be made to encourage the continued development of the movement. In order to exchange experiences in a timely manner, influence each other, and facilitate the selection of model factories, areas with more concentrated factories should be grouped together (regardless of which system they belong to) and competitions should be launched with each other; and the factories should jointly organize competition committees to understand and promote each other. When the movement is summarized, it will take on the leadership work of comparison and selection, so that the truly model factories can be selected. In the movement, attention should be paid to cultivating labor heroes and model workers, first creating a model department to promote the entire factory.
    Since the land reform, our region's dispersed small-scale handicraft industry is developing, and it should be a part of the industrial production movement. In the movement, attention should be paid to helping it, organizing it in the form of cooperation, and participating in the movement. At present, some carpentry, ironwork, coal mining, porcelain, saltpeter boiling, leather, agricultural tool and other factory handicraft industries and cooperatives have emerged in various places and have achieved great results. This movement should be promoted to develop the factory handicraft industry in the entire region.
    Among the workers and peasants, we must emphasize the idea of workers and peasants as one family, and strengthen worker-peasant unity and worker-peasant mutual assistance. After the rural areas are organized, they should take the initiative to mobilize the surplus labor force to work in factories and coal mines, while the workers and coal mine workers should take the initiative to help the peasants to turn themselves around and develop sideline occupations, and carry out the movement of small handicraft industries and factories.
    The idea of serving the people of the liberated areas and serving the front lines of the self-defense war should be universally established among all workers; the view of reducing production quality solely for the purpose of completing production quantities or solely for the purpose of making money must be corrected. We should pay close attention to improving technology and production quality. Some industrial and commercial operators have a purely profit-making view, such as the result of the blind development of the cigarette industry, where the factory loses money and the workers lose their jobs, which outweighs the gains. The local government and the trade union should convene a joint factory meeting to negotiate a solution; and they should generally publicize the view of developing industry according to the needs of the war and the people.
    In order to ensure that the movement is successful, the leadership must be unified, the unity of the three-person committee must be strengthened, the administration must respect the opinions of the trade union, and the trade union should cooperate with the work of the administration. The three-person committee should first unite and become the core of uniting all employees and workers and boldly launching the workers' production movement.
    Let all factory and mine employees and workers be actively mobilized, carry forward the Chinese working class's spirit of hard struggle and heroic dedication, and strive to develop industrial production, serve the front lines of the self-defense war, and welcome the arrival of light!

### 纪念“二七”开展职工生产运动

    纪念“二七”开展职工生产运动
    伟大的“二七”纪念来临，我区广大职工正在准备配合全区大生产运动，促进工业生产。我们指导工厂生产的方针是实现毛主席的指示：“原料足，成本低，质量高，产量多，销路广。”贯彻劳资合作发展生产的方针，发动职工生产的热忱，支援前线，是我区一九四七年职工运动的方向。
    我区在实现劳资合作发展生产方面，曾创造许多经验。如劳资合营，全面分红（如长治等地小型工厂），超过规定生产标准即发给奖品或进行分红；如果由于改良工具或加强劳动强度而普遍提高生产标准时，则同时增加工资；按件计算工资，多劳动多获得；奖励创造发明；以及成立工厂管理委员会，吸收职工参加等等办法，以刺激生产向上。这可以提高职工的责任心与积极性，而资方亦乐于投资。今后还应继续研究提高生产的办法，如提倡经济核算、成本会计等，以便进一步贯彻劳资合作发展生产的方针。
    目前边区职工生活已经取得适当改善；今后奋斗方向，除时事教育外，应加强新劳动观点、技术、生产、民主、爱厂等教育，以充分发动职工自觉性为自卫战争服务生产。并提倡尊师爱徒、尊重技术，群众性的研究技术和创造发明。在人与人、厂与厂间，提倡团结互助共同发展生产，建立职工合作社，组织职工家属生产，建立家务。
    工业生产运动必须是全厂全体职员与工人的运动；单纯是工人动，职员不动，运动就搞不好。过去工运只注意工人而忽略职员（或干部）的发动，当工人群众发动起来，生产效率提高了，而在原料工具供给、成品保管推销、机构制度作风等方面，停止不前，赶不上运动要求，因而常常影响运动的发展。这种现象必须改正。今后不论职员（厂长在内）或工人，应该毫无例外的吸收到运动中来。当着群众已经发动起来，职工的责任心已经加强之后，劳动及工作效率必然提高，因而必然要求精简不必要的人员（包括职员及工人），改变不合理的制度，及反对官僚主义的作风。领导上必须实行群众路线，一切非企业化与妨碍职工群众发动的机构制度及官僚主义，都应加以改造和抛弃。根据生产及群众的需要，建设新的机构、制度与作风，以达到工厂全面改造全面提高的要求。
    运动的计划、竞赛、检查、总结、比选等一切工作必须放手发动全厂职工群众，依靠群众的自觉性，贯彻从群众中来又到群众中去的群众路线。根据本厂生产及群众需要，由负责人及英雄带头，全厂职工都在自己岗位上，订出个人提高生产的计划；然后集中起来，就是全厂运动的具体要求。不论挑战、应战、总结、比选，均以此为标准。及时总结、比选与奖励，以便鼓励运动继续开展。为及时交流经验，相互影响推动，便于比选模范厂，以工厂较集中之地区为一集团（不论其属于任何系统领导），相互展开竞赛；并由各厂联合组织竞赛委员会，相互了解与推动。运动总结时它便担任起比选领导工作，使真正模范的工厂得以被选。在运动中应注意培养劳动英雄与模范工作者，首先创造一个模范部门，以推动全厂。
    土地改革以来，我区分散的小手工业正在发展，它应该是工业生产运动的一个部分，在运动中应注意帮助它，采取合作形式组织起来，参加运动。目前各地已出现一些木工、铁工、采煤、瓷器、熬硝、皮革、农具等工厂手工业及合作社，已有很大成绩。应推广这一运动，使全区工厂手工业发达起来。
    在工农群众中，必须强调工农一家的思想，加强工农团结、工农互助。农村组织起来后，应该主动的把剩余劳动力动员到工厂、煤矿里去做工，而工厂和煤矿职工则应主动的友爱的帮助农民翻身与发展副业，开展小手工业工厂作坊的运动。
    为解放区人民服务，为支援自卫战争前线服务的观点，在全体职工中，应普遍建立起来；单为完成生产数量或单为赚钱而降低生产质量的观点必须纠正。应十分注意提高技术，提高生产质量。某些工商业经营者，单纯营利观点，如对纸烟业盲目发展的结果，厂方赔钱，工人失业，得不偿失。当地政府及工会应召开工厂联席会议，协商解决；并应普遍宣传根据战争及人民需要而发展工业的观点。
    为保证运动搞好，领导必须统一，加强三人委员会的一元化，行政要尊重工会意见，工会则应配合行政的工作。三人委员会首先团结一致，并成为团结全体职工放手发动职工生产运动的核心。
    一切工厂矿山职员工人积极动员起来，发扬中国工人阶级艰苦奋斗、英勇献身的精神，努力发展工业生产，为自卫战争的前线服务，迎接光明到来！
