    【This newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch】 After land reform in Gao Ping, the peasants who have turned over, in order to protect their fruits, made a turn-over declaration. The oath is as follows: 1. Think about the past suffering, compare it with the good times now. The peasants who have turned over must unite, and unity is like iron. 2. The peasant association organization must be cherished, the militia must be armed, transportation and stretchers must not lag behind, and support the front to fight against Chiang Kai-shek. 3. Recognize landlords and despots. Secret agents often want to revive. We must improve our vigilance. Whoever wants to revive, eliminate them. 4. Organize mutual aid and large-scale production, and every household should make production plans. Organize men, women, old and young, work hard together, and get rich together. 5. Support the democratic government and implement the government's new decrees. 6. Support the sons and daughters soldiers, expand the sons and daughters soldiers, cherish the Eighth Route Army, and the army and the people are one family. Respond to Chairman Mao's call, support the Communist Party's propositions, and always follow the Communist Party.
    【This newspaper, Weixian, 5th dispatch】 In the Great Examination Movement, Wu Xun timely proposed to "change the mind" in order to improve the masses' awareness. Peasants, women, militia, and village cadres all held "think meetings" to recall the past and compare it with the present by means of accounting, clarifying that the present good times were given by the Communist Party. At the small group meeting in Dazhifangtou Village, the old man Cao Zhentang said: "Our family of five had nine mu of land. When the traitor was in power, the land was sold and fled. When the Communist Party came, the nine mu of land was redeemed. We harvested 18 shi of grain in three years and were also allocated several mu of land." After such accounting, the masses' awareness was improved, and then a washing face meeting of mutual criticism was launched to examine the bad things they had done. The village chief of Zhifangtou Village reflected: "I used to have some corruption." The peasant association chairman reflected on wasting the fruits of the struggle, and middle peasant Cao Chengzhu said that he tried to avoid going on business trips and wanted to sell the cow. After this reflection, the masses consciously achieved great unity and consolidated the organization. They also consciously took an oath. Many people said: "The good days were given by the Communist Party, Chairman Mao is our head of the family, if Lao Jiang comes, we will fight him to the end together."
