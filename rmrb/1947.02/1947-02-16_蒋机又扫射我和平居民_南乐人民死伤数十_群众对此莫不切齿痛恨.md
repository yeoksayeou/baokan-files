　　Chiang Kai-shek's Planes Strafe Peaceful Residents Again
　　Dozens of Casualties in Nanle, People Bitterly Hate This
　　[Our Newspaper Jilu Yu Dispatch, 14th] Chiang Kai-shek's planes strafed peaceful residents in Nanle again. On January 9th, Zhang Guo Village in Nanle was holding a large market, and the crowds were very dense. At 10:00 AM, two American-style Chiang Kai-shek planes flew over and circled, then opened fire and strafed the crowd, killing more than twenty people, seriously wounding twelve, and slightly wounding three. Liang Fugui, a villager from Dongmei Village who was attending the market, was shot in the abdomen, and his intestines spilled out, resulting in his death. The Fugui brothers were also seriously injured. Their family still has a sixty-year-old father who was allocated several acres of land and relied entirely on the labor of the two brothers. Now, with one dead and one injured, the situation is tragic. Wang Dao-yi's old mother from Zhang Er Village, who was leading her fifteen-year-old granddaughter to the market to sell straw hat braids, was also shot dead. Wang Dao-yi's mother was shot in the waist and died half an hour later. The little granddaughter was shot in half of her head, and a small hair braid was still tied to the bloody half of her head. Zhi En, a farmer in his fifties from Zhang San Village, was shot in the waist, leaving a fist-sized hole, blood flowing all over the ground, and died in agony. Chiang Kai-shek is so ferocious and evil that the masses are filled with immense indignation.
　　[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] Two American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes flew over Cheng Zhao Village, west of Gaoyi City, on the 28th of last month, and dropped two bombs on peaceful residents celebrating the New Year. Then, they strafed Wan Cheng Town at low altitude. The local people are filled with bitter hatred for this atrocity committed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes.
　　[Xinhua News Agency Jin Sui Dispatch, 14th] Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been circling and bombing the Suihua liberated area in Jin Sui for days. After bombing Yao County outside the city, they bombed Shuo County City again, killing and wounding nine peaceful residents. In the past half month, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have strafed Xiao, Lishi, Huai Ren and other places four times.
