　　Daming Municipal Government Issues Regulations
　　Calling on Landlords Who Fled to Return to the City
　　[Report from this newspaper's Jinnan bureau, 18th] After the liberation of Daming, our democratic government immediately promulgated provisional regulations concerning landlords and called on landlords who had fled to return to the city. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the area, some lawless landlords, supported by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, illegally reversed the results of the masses' liquidation. Some not only demanded the return of what was taken but also imposed additional penalties on the peasants. The large landlord Zhang Heiwu, in addition to reversing the liquidation of materials, also demolished the houses of peasants and said fiercely, "I will dig up the roots of your walls." Wei Dian landlord Zhu Zhi became the enemy's head of the large township and buried six village cadres from that village alive. However, many landlords understood righteousness deeply and stood with the peasants, protecting our cadres and the families of soldiers and workers resisting the enemy. For example, Wei Yuqing, a landlord in South Street, went through the enemy's strict blockade to comfort the families of soldiers and workers resisting the enemy who were suffering in the disaster. Under his influence, no household in South Street was subject to reversal, and no one was brutally murdered. The democratic government, based on the different behaviors of the landlords, announced four provisional measures for landlords: 1. Those who participated in the "Homecoming Corps," resolutely supported the enemy's leadership in "reversing the liquidation," and the traitorous and tyrannical landlord Zhu Zhi, who brutally murdered the people, will be arrested and their property confiscated and distributed to the disaster-stricken masses. 2. Those who followed the "Homecoming Corps" to reverse the liquidation but did not inflict additional harm on the peasants will be ordered to return the materials taken and given a serious warning. If they can faithfully implement the decrees of the democratic government in the future, they will be declared innocent. 3. Landlords who appear neutral on the surface but speak sarcastically behind their backs, but have not taken any action to reverse the liquidation, will be educated in public. 4. Those who abide by the law and protect the interests of the families of soldiers and workers resisting the enemy and the people, such as Wei Yuqing, will be commended and encouraged. Since the announcement of these measures, some landlords have returned to the city one after another and expressed their gratitude for the democratic government's lenient policy.

　　大名市府颁布条例
    号召外逃地主回城
    【本报冀南十八日电】大名解放后，我民主政府即颁布对地主各项暂行条例，并号召外逃地主回城。在蒋军盘据时，有部分不法地主，在蒋军扶植下，非法倒去群众清算的果实，有的除索回被清算者外，还给农民以额外处罚。大地主张黑五，除倒去被清算的物资外，又拆掉农民的房子，并狠狠的说：“非把你的墙根刨光不可。”魏店地主朱智，当了敌人的大乡长，活埋该村村干六人。但亦有很多地主深明大义，和农民站在一起，保护我干部与抗军工属。如南街地主魏玉卿，曾通过敌人的严密封锁，去慰问在灾难中的抗军工属，在他的影响下，南街没有一户被倒算，没一人被惨杀。民主政府特根据地主的不同表现，对地主公布四项暂行办法：一、对参加“还乡团”坚决事敌领导“倒算”，与惨杀人民的朱智等奸霸地主，除通令严缉外并将其财产没收，分给被灾群众。二、对随从“还乡团”进行倒算，但没有额外残害农民者，除将倒走的物资退还群众外，并给予严重警告，日后如能忠诚执行民主政府法令，即宣告无罪。三、对表面中立背后说风凉话，确无倒算举动之地主，当众予以教育。四、奉公守法保护抗军工属及人民利益者，如魏玉卿等，予以表扬鼓励。自该办法公布后，某些地主纷纷回城，对民主政府的宽大政策极表感谢。
