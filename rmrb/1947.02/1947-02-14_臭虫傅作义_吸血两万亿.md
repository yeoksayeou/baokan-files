Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, February 10th: Under the military and political power of Fu Zuoyi, the Kuomintang's warlord in Suiyuan, his "bureaucratic capital" has been expanding fiercely over the years. The business firms and money houses opened by Fu are all over several provinces. According to existing materials, there are four in Xi'an: Gongyi Firm, Heji Money House, Yongxing Firm, and Yongsheng Firm. In Lanzhou, there are five: Yongsheng Firm, Yongxing Firm, Lanzhou Warehouse, Jicheng Firm, and Gongji Woolen Mill. Also, there is Yongli Firm in Chengdu, and Kecheng General Merchandise Store in Ningxia, etc. The total capital is about 6 billion yuan, not including the various branches. In addition, under the guise of land reclamation, he has seized farmland from Mongolian pastures in many ways. The suffering of the people as a result is incalculable. Fu Zuoyi ruled Suiyuan for fifteen years, and the proceeds of his plunder were mostly invested in other provinces or deposited abroad to avoid attracting attention. According to a revelation at the Fourth National Political Consultative Conference, Second Session, Fu Zuoyi's deposits in the United States ranked fourteenth among Chinese depositors. According to an estimate by a senior general in Fu's army, Fu's total assets are more than two trillion yuan. If divided equally among the two million people of Suiyuan, each person would receive about one million yuan.

    臭虫傅作义
    吸血两万亿
    【新华社晋绥十日电】国民党绥远军阀傅作义之“官僚资本“历年来在其军事政治力量下猛力扩展傅氏开设之商号钱庄遍布数省。据现有材料计有西安公益号、合记钱庄、永兴号、永胜号四家。兰州之永胜号、永兴号、兰州货栈、济成号、公积毛织厂五家，及成都之永利号，宁夏之克城公杂货店等资金总计约六十亿，各个分号尚不在内。此外更用开垦名义，在蒙民牧场多方面占民田，人民因此受其害者无法计算。傅作义统治绥远凡十五年，搜刮所得多投资外省或存放国外，以避人耳目。据国民参政会四届二次大会中有人揭露，傅作义在美存款占中国存款第十四位。据傅部某高级将领估计，傅资产总额当在两万亿以上，若由二百万绥人平分，每人约得百万元。
