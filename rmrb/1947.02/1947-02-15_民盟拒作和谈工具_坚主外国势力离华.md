Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 8th (Delayed Dispatch): According to a Tianjin newspaper report citing a Shanghai special dispatch: The China Democratic League (CDL) hosted a gathering for Shanghai's industrial, commercial, cultural, and journalistic circles on the first of this month. Over 300 people attended, including Ma Yinchu, Liu Yazi, Shen Tilan, and Sheng Pihua. All CDL leaders remaining in Shanghai were present. Zhang Lan, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji, Shi Fuliang, and others spoke successively, unanimously advocating: (1) Expanding the CDL, recruiting democratic figures into the League, and uniting various democratic groups to engage in deep, widespread, and genuine democratic movements. (2) Regarding peace talks, they unanimously advocated refusing to be a "tool for peace talks," insisting on the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), and enhancing the PCC's power to resolve national affairs. (3) Speakers strongly advocated that foreign labor should withdraw from China; otherwise, China's democracy and peace would be hopeless; and the so-called "reorganization of the government" before democracy and peace are established would only be detrimental. Professor W.H. Grant, a Canadian friend attending the reception, also spoke, vehemently denouncing the U.S. policy toward China, which unfairly interferes in any Chinese event, and put forward the aggressive slogan of "Open Door Policy," which is thoroughgoing imperialism. Mr. Grant called on Chinese intellectuals to strive for the democratic movement to save the people and save the world, because people all over the world are against war.

    民盟拒作和谈工具
    坚主外国势力离华
    【新华社延安八日电】（迟到）据天津报载上海专电：民盟于本月一日招待沪工商文化新闻各界，出席马寅初、柳亚子、沈体兰、盛丕华等三百余人，民盟留沪领袖均出席。张澜、张东荪、罗降基、施复亮等先后发言，一致主张：（一）扩大民盟，延揽民主人士入盟，并联合各民主团体以从事深入、普遍、真正的民主运动。（二）关于和谈，一致主张拒绝作“和谈工具”，坚持政协，提高政协权力，以解决国事。（三）发言者力主外国劳力应撤出中国，否则中国民主和平无望；而民主和平未确立前之所谓“改组政府”，只有坏处。出席招待会之加拿大友人文幼章教授亦发言，痛斥美国对华政策，对任何中国事件均作不公正之干涉，并提出“门户开放”之侵略口号，此为彻头彻尾之帝国主义。文氏呼吁中国知识分子努力民主运动，以拯救人民、拯救世界，因为全世界人民都反对战争。
