    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Military Region Supply Department held a meeting of over a hundred cadres on the 26th of last month, reviewing the phenomena of peaceful illusions, extravagance and waste, and taking public funds to do one's own business. It was decided that the clearing of warehouses and the consolidation of accounts would be completed by the beginning of summer. At that time, surplus materials worth 100 million yuan can be offered to the Party. Minister Zhou called on everyone to carry out production and savings, stipulating that each person's spare-time production task should be 6,000 to 10,000 yuan, organizing all cadres' family members to participate in production to achieve "self-sufficiency through labor," and transferring odd-job personnel to coal mines to mine coal. Minister Zhou announced his own plan: (1) Reduce one of the two draft animals on the establishment. (2) Abolish the small kitchen. The cadres attending the meeting immediately responded, sparking a wave of donations, each proposing a plan for production and savings. Many comrades contributed their larger savings to the Party. By the end of the meeting, donations had reached one million yuan.

    军区供给部干部订出生产节约计划
    并将个人积蓄贡献给党
    生产节约迎接光明
    【本报特讯】军区供给部于上月二十六日召开百余干部会议，检讨和平幻想、铺张浪费，以公款做自己买卖等抓一把现象，决定于夏初完成清理库房、整理账目。届时可将价值十万万元的积余资材供献给党。周部长号召大家进行生产节约，规定每人的业余生产任务为六千元至万元，组织所有干部家属参加生产，做到“劳动自给”，并抽调勤杂人员到煤窑挖煤。周部长宣布自己的计划：（一）把编制上的两头牲口，减去一头。（二）取消小厨房。与会干部立即响应，激起献金浪潮，各自提出生产节约的计划。许多同志将自己较多的积蓄贡献给党，此次献金在会议结束时已达百万元。
