Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. On the 27th of last month, Shanghai industrialists Zhang @bo and Bao Dasan gave an interview to Wenhui Daily reporters, denouncing Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Kuomintang's puppet organization "National Federation of Commerce," and others for their "Appeal for Peace Declaration," saying they were speaking for the Jiang government and attempting to leave themselves an out in the event of military setbacks, rather than genuinely seeking a path to peace. The two stated: "Empty calls for peace are of no use. There should be conditions and actions to demand it. The industrial and commercial sectors, as well as people nationwide, should, on the one hand, demand that the government stop conscription and grain requisition, reduce rent and interest, and on the other hand, prepare to express the determination of the industrial and commercial sectors to demand peace through action. Only in this way can peace be hoped for." Note: On the 25th of last month, Wang Xiaolai and others issued a declaration in Shanghai, echoing the Jiang government's peace offensive.

　　王晓籁为“和平”攻势帮腔
    实业家张＠伯痛斥
    【新华社延安一日电】上月二十七日上海实业家张＠伯、包达三两氏，向文汇报记者发表谈话，指斥国民党御用团体“全国商联会”理事长王晓籁等之“呼吁和平宣言”为蒋政府帮腔，企图在军事不利时留一余地，而并非想由此开一和平坦途。二氏称：“空言呼吁和平无补于事，应有条件有行动来要求，工商界以及全国人士应一面要求政府停止征兵征粮，减租减息，一面准备以行动表示工商界要求和平之决心。如此，和平方能有望。”按：上月二十五日王晓籁等曾在沪发表宣言，呼应蒋政府之和平攻势。
