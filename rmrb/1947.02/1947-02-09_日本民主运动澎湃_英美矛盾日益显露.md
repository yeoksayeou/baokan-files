    Japanese Democratic Movement Surges Forward
    Anglo-American Contradictions Become Increasingly Apparent
    Japan, Britain, and the United States have been the center of major world events in the past week.
    In Japan, the General Federation of Labor's strike was originally scheduled to begin on February 1st. This strike had been planned for over a month, and its power can be seen from the Nanjing flag-lowering demonstration on January 28th. 350,000 people participated in this demonstration. The "Internationale" shook the declining "Eight ＠ One Characters" of the imperial capital, and the Yoshida Cabinet was once in jeopardy because of it. Labor leaders, unwilling to be intimidated by the American officials of MacArthur's headquarters and the terror tactics of the Japanese reactionaries, insisted on preparing for the general strike. Their statement that they would rather go to jail than betray the workers is truly admirable. When MacArthur explicitly forbade the General Federation of Labor's strike on January 31st, on the one hand, they abandoned the plan to launch a general strike by seventeen trade unions simultaneously, and on the other hand, the workers themselves prepared to launch individual strikes to wait for an opportunity to respond, which is also truly admirable. The ferocious face of the U.S. occupying forces was further exposed by MacArthur's order. The Japanese working class, in the planning of this general strike, fully demonstrated that its organization and awareness have been unprecedentedly improved. Even the most conservative government employees among the staff have stood at the forefront of the struggle. This will undoubtedly have a great significance for the development of the Japanese democratic movement in the future.
    In Britain, its diplomatic dynamics are particularly noteworthy. The House of Lords held its first debate on the China issue on January 23rd. Lord Lindsay, a Labour Party peer, criticized the Chiang Kai-shek government and suggested sending representatives to Yan'an to establish direct contact with the CCP. Most speakers in the debate expressed concern. Regarding the United States' monopolization of trade with China, Justice Minister Jowitt reiterated the decision on the China issue made at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers the year before in response to this question. He proposed and declared that Britain did not want to see "China subjected to the forced power politics of any group or party." The Chinese people deeply welcome these fair opinions of the British. Anglo-Soviet relations are also an urgent issue facing the Labour government recently. After Bevin condemned *Pravda* for abandoning the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, the note to Stalin and Stalin's reply were considered by *The Times* and others to have "provided the possibility of improving Anglo-Soviet relations." TASS has recently been urging Britain to abide by the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, which "stipulates that the two countries jointly undertake the organizational work of European security and economic prosperity." And advocates modifying and strengthening the treaty. The Anglo-Soviet Friendship Conference was held on the 26th, launching a mass movement throughout Britain to strengthen Anglo-Soviet friendship. Labour opposition MPs have indicated that they will question the government in the House of Commons about "decorating" Anglo-Soviet relations. In addition to its policies towards China and the Soviet Union, the Labour government has been busy dealing with a series of colonial issues in the past week, such as the Indian Constituent Assembly, Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, Anglo-Burmese negotiations, and the Palestine Conference. This shows on the one hand that the colonies under the rule of the old British Empire are unstable everywhere, and on the other hand, it shows that the US imperialist expansion policy in the British colonies is causing the Labour government a great headache. The U.S.-armed Jewish underground army in Palestine continues to riot, and U.S. Senate officials have recently reiterated their hope to occupy a larger share in Indian trade. Even as the Anglo-Burmese negotiations were just concluding, the U.S. State Department publicly declared that the United States and Burma had established a so-called "sincere" relationship. This month, the British Empire Conference will be held specifically to discuss the issue of imperial preference demanded by the United States to be abolished.
    Regarding the United States, calculated according to last winter's production level, the total output value has reached a peak of 305 billion U.S. dollars per year in peacetime. In order to pursue profits, U.S. capitalists will expand production by 3.6 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months of this year. The economic crisis of overproduction will thus come as soon as possible. And overproduction of food is a *fait accompli*. The Department of Agriculture has announced its readiness to destroy 630,000 tons of potatoes. What a satire this is to the "official attire" of American diplomats who boast about the United States' relief to the starving people of various countries! Recently, economists from almost all European countries have unanimously believed that the United States will soon have a "commercial depression." Most of them believe that it will be before the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Those conservative groups relying on financial support are fearfully talking about this.
    The evolution of Anglo-Soviet relations, Britain's concern about the China issue, Anglo-American differences on Eastern issues, and MacArthur's policies in Japan will naturally have an impact on the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference to be held on the tenth of next month.

### 日本民主运动澎湃  英美矛盾日益显露

    日本民主运动澎湃
    英美矛盾日益显露
    日本、英国和美国成了过去一周世界大事的中心。
    在日本，总同盟罢工原定二月一日开始，这次总同盟罢工筹划已历月余，其力量之雄伟可由一月廿八日南京倒旗大示威中见之。参加此次大示威者达三十五万人。“红旗之歌”震撼了没落的“八＠一字”的帝都，吉田内阁曾因此岌岌可危。劳工领袖不愿麦克阿瑟总部美官员的恫吓，以及日反动派的恐怖手段，坚持准备总罢工工作。声言宁愿入狱而不肯背叛工人，毅然决然令人起敬。及一月三十一日麦克阿瑟明令禁止总同盟罢工后，则一方面放弃十七个工会同时发动总同盟罢工的计划，另一方面各工人自行准备发动个别罢工续机应变，又实在令人赞叹不已。美占领军当局的狰狞面目，却因麦克阿瑟的一纸命令，更暴露无遗。日本工人阶级在这次同盟罢工的筹划中，充分证明了其组织性与觉悟性已空前的提高。甚至向来职工中最保守的政府公务员，也站在斗争的前列。这对今后日本民主运动的发展，无疑将会有巨大的意义。
    在英国，其外交动态殊堪注意。上院于一月二十三日首次展开关于中国问题的辩论，工党上院议员林赛爵士，批评蒋介石政府，并建议派遣代表到延安与中共建立直接联系。辩论中多数发言者，均表关切。关于美国独占中国的贸易，司法大臣佐威特于答复此问题时，重申前年三国外长莫斯科会议，关于中国问题的决定。他提议并声明英国不愿看到“中国受到任何一个集团或政党所强行的强权政治”，对于这些英国人士的公允的意见，中国人民深表欢迎。英苏关系亦为工党政府近来所面临的迫切问题。贝文于真理报谴责其抛弃英苏同盟条约后，给斯大林的照会以及斯大林的复文，被泰晤士报等认为“提供了改进英苏关系的可能性”。塔斯社近力促英国遵守英苏同盟条约中“规定两国联合担负欧洲安理与经济繁荣的组织工作的一部分”。并主修改与加强该条约。英苏友谊场合已于二十六日召开，在全英展开一加强英苏友好的群众运动。工党反对派议员已表示将在下院质问政府“装饰”英苏关系。除对华对苏政策外，工党政府周来忙于处理一连串的殖民地问题，印度制宪会议、英埃谈判、英缅谈判、巴勒斯坦会议等。这一方面表现老大的大英帝国统治下的殖民地到处不稳，另一方面又显示美帝国主义对英殖民地的扩张政策，使工党政府大感头痛。巴勒斯坦的美械犹太地下军，骚动未已，而美国上议院官员近又重申希望在印度贸易中占更大场面。甚至当英缅谈判刚告结束，美国务院即公开声明美国与缅甸建立所谓“诚挚”关系。本月份内，大英帝国会议将召开专为商讨美方所要求取消的帝国优先权问题。
    关于美国按去年冬季生产水准计算，生产总值已达每年三千零五十亿美元的和平时期最高纪录。美资本家为追逐利润，在今年首三个月又将以三十六亿美元扩充生产。生产过剩之经济危机，将因之尽速到来。而粮食生产过剩，则为既成事实。农业部已宣布准备毁坏六十三万吨洋芋，此对口口声声夸耀美国救济各国饥民的“峨冠燕服”的美国外交家，是何等的讽刺？最近欧洲所有国家的经济学者，几乎一致认为美国不久即将有一“商业萧条”。时间绝大多数认为在今年底或明年初以前。那些靠金元撑腰的保守集团，正恐惧地谈论着这点。
    一周来英苏关系的演进，英国对中国问题的关切，英美对东方问题的分歧，以及麦克阿瑟在日本的政策等等，对下月十日举行的四强外长莫斯科会议，自然会发生影响。
