[This article was] Transmitted from the Front Lines of the Ji-Lu-Yu [area] on the 6th of this month: The order issued by Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense on October 16th of last year to suppress the petitions of Chiang's army officers who had been demobilized has been seized by the Eighth Route Army during the recapture of Shan County. The telegram is numbered Quántǒng [銓統] 0077 by the Ministry of National Defense. It states: "Recently, a considerable number of people are requesting accommodation in the name of unemployed officers, and some are arbitrarily organizing groups and electing representatives to petition. An investigation reveals that these elements are nothing more than soldiers who 'cherish life and fear death,' or those who formerly held military positions but 'refused to sacrifice during the War of Resistance,' or 'local ruffians masquerading as officers.' If strict investigation and suppression are not carried out, the situation will inevitably become uncontrollable, and it will easily undermine law and discipline, be exploited by 'treacherous bandits,' affect public security, and bring disaster to society. Military and police agencies in all localities, upon encountering such organizations, shall immediately disperse them and detain the representatives for severe punishment."

    蒋介石镇压请愿军官
    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】蒋介石国防部于去年十月十六日所发镇压蒋军编余军官请愿之命令，已为八路军在收复单县缴获。该电令为国防部铨统字○○七七号，内称：近以无职军官名义请求收容者不在少数，且有任意组织团体，复举代表请愿者，查其分子不外“贪生怕死”之军人，或过去曾任军职，在“抗战中不肯牺牲者”，或为“地痞流氓冒充军官者”，若不严为查办取缔，则势无抑止之效，抑且足以破坏法纪，易为“奸匪”利用，影响治安，祸患社会，各地军警机关，凡遇此类组织，立即予以驱散，并将代表予以扣留处办重惩。
