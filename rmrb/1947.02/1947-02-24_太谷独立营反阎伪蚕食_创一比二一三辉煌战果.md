　　Taigu Independent Battalion Fights Back Against Yan's Puppet Encroachment
    Creating a Brilliant Victory of 1:213
    [Reported from Taihang on the 22nd of this month] In the three months from December to February, our Taigu Independent Battalion, in its fight against Yan's puppet encroachment, killed and wounded 120 enemies and captured 93 enemy personnel including company commanders. We achieved a brilliant victory with an enemy casualty ratio of 1:213. The experience of success is as follows: (1) We concentrated our forces to attack the enemy's weaknesses. Later, against Yan's puppet's "flood-like" offensive, our troops moved quickly, hitting the enemy everywhere. We did not defend key points and engage in head-on confrontations with the enemy. (2) We created plains village ambush tactics, flying ambushes, and "thunder in the east, rain in the west" tactics to confuse the enemy, along with sniper and mine warfare and outflanking tactics. (3) Master the enemy's patterns of movement. During night marches, remain silent, avoid main roads, and do not pass through villages. When reaching the ambush village, if dogs bark, feed them with dry rations. Set up triangular, double-walled, or bag-shaped formations at the ambush site. Once the enemy enters our ambush circle, launch a fierce attack and rapid pursuit. After throwing a volley of grenades, charge into close combat to quickly eliminate the enemy. (4) When leading the militia to fight, if they are only used as reserves, they are often unwilling. They should charge alongside the troops. During ambushes, they should expose themselves on the periphery to attract and threaten the enemy, playing a direct supporting role. (5) All commanders and fighters take the lead in charging and fighting. Troops, local cadres, and militia share hardships and joys together to unite internally and boost confidence in victory. (6) After each battle, immediately withdraw the troops to a safe place to rest, reorganize, and summarize experiences. At the same time, closely monitor the enemy's situation and seize opportunities to strike again. (7) Ambush locations should be selected in landlord's houses, temples, depressions, graves, vegetable gardens, and walls around canals to prevent the enemy from burning civilian houses after entering the village. (Dong Ruqiang, Li Tuofu)
    [Reported from Taiyue on the 22nd of this month] In the past month, under the influence of Gao Huida's combat team, the Zhao City militia has launched a revenge movement. They fought 16 battles, annihilated 40 enemies, destroyed two military vehicles, captured one rifle, 30 rounds of ammunition, and over 10,000 catties of foreign flour.

　　太谷独立营反阎伪蚕食
    创一比二一三辉煌战果
    【本报太行二十二日电】十二月至二月三个月内，我太谷独立营在反阎伪蚕食中，毙伤敌一百二十名，俘中队长以下九十三名。创造我敌伤亡一比二百一十三的辉煌战果。获胜经验如下：（１）我集中兵力，打击敌人弱点。以后阎伪的“水漫式”进攻，我部队满地飞，弄得敌到处挨打。并不把守要口与敌硬拚。（２）创造了平原村落伏击战，飞行伏击，和“东边响雷，西边下雨”，迷惑敌人的冷枪地雷迂回战。（３）掌握敌行动规律。夜间行军要肃静，不走大道，不过村，到伏击村狗叫就用干粮喂它。在伏击地布好三角形、双壁形、或布袋形等阵势，敌人进入我伏击圈内，随即猛扑急追；打一排子炸弹后就冲出白刃格斗迅速歼灭敌人。（４）带领民兵作战若仅叫他们作预备队，他们多不愿意。应使他们和部队一齐冲锋。打伏击战时，应叫他们在外围到处暴露，以吸引和威胁敌人，起直接配合作用。（５）全体指战员一律冲锋陷阵，部队、地方干部与民兵共患难同甘苦，以团结内部，提高胜利信心。（６）每次战斗后，马上将部队撤至安全地方，休息整理并总结经验。一方面又要掌握敌情，一有机会抓紧敌人又打。（７）伏击地点应选择地主房屋、庙宇、凹道、墓坑、菜园、水渠围墙等，以免敌进村后烧毁民房。（董儒强、李托夫）
    【本报太岳二十二日讯】一月来我赵城民兵在高辉达战斗队影响下，展开复仇运动。作战十六次，歼敌四十名，毁军汽两辆，缴步枪一支，子弹三十排，洋面万余斤。
