[This dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 10th] Chiang's aircraft have been strafing our employees repairing dikes and residents passing by in the old course of the Yellow River for days. On the morning of January 28th, a Chiang aircraft flew in from the southwest and began indiscriminate strafing over Sunkou, Shouzhang. More than 30 residents were crossing the river at the time. Eight people were shot dead, two drowned when the ferry was hit and sank, and two more froze to death after floating to shore. On the 30th, villagers in a village north of Yuncheng repaired a damaged boat and put it in the water for self-rescue. On that day, the entire village gathered to pull the boat when a Chiang aircraft circled overhead and strafed for 20 minutes, killing four and wounding nine. Ding Huaifang’s eleven-year-old daughter, a resident of the village, was watching from the courtyard and had her arm broken. On the 31st, Meng, the chief of our Yellow River Committee, led more than 100 employees to rush to repair the washed-out dikes at Chuwa, Fanxian. At 10 a.m., a Chiang aircraft intruded and strafed for an hour, killing Li Ziyi, a worker, and Chu Erxiao, a child who was helping repair the dike, along with thirteen others; fifteen were wounded. On February 1st, Chiang’s aircraft strafed employees repairing dikes at Sunkou, destroying four carts and wounding three employees. The next day, they strafed again at Sunkou, killing one carter and one head of livestock. After strafing, they flew over the south gate of Shouzhang City and strafed residents at the market, killing one and wounding five. The masses in northern Yuncheng picked up shell casings dropped by Chiang's aircraft with the letters "U.S.A." on them. Seeing the American letters, they said with even greater resentment: "What crime have the people committed? Chiang, this American foster son, released the water to flood us, and now he's using such vicious tactics!"

[This dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 10th] After Chiang's side released the water, our employees repairing the dikes were murdered by Chiang's troops, and repair materials were robbed. On January 13th, our Yellow River Committee led the masses to rush to repair the river dikes at Machang, Nanhua, when a unit of Chiang's troops stationed in Dongming suddenly opened fire and strafed the employees, killing six and wounding four, and robbing more than 600 catties of hemp rope for repairs. The masses were extremely angry. Li Erhai, a dike repair worker who was wounded, said: "What is Chiang's intention? He released the water and won't let us repair the dikes. Does he want us to be drowned alive?"

[This dispatch from our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 10th] The people along the river at Kunwu are extremely resentful of the Yellow River's diverted flow. Before the Yellow River changed its course, because Chiang Kai-shek's government did not properly repair the dikes, the crops along the river were often flooded, and the grain harvested each year was not enough to eat. The residents all ran around, begging for food. Uncle Ge, a river resident, said: "I moved eighteen times in my twenties, almost always fleeing and wandering. The crops are planted in the water, and when they are harvested in the autumn, the stalks constantly cut our legs and feet, causing constant bleeding, and mosquito bites cause sores all over the body. All year round, it's really hard! After the Yellow River changed its course, the Eighth Route Army came, and everyone lived a peaceful life. But Chiang Kai-shek, this bastard, can't be killed with soldiers, so he wants to drown us with water. We'd rather die fighting him!" After the floodwaters came, a woman from Haicun went to Beiheyan Road to visit her mother. When she returned, there was no ferry, so she had to wade across the river. She froze to death as soon as she reached the shore. On the 24th, two old men waded across the river and collapsed and drowned in the water because they couldn't stand the cold. On the 26th, seven or eight residents from the south bank went to Xichengji on the north bank for the market and all froze to death while wading. In just four or five days, more than thirty people have been killed. I don't know how many people will be hurt when the water is high. Now the democratic government is leading the masses to rise up to save themselves and is rushing to build ferries.

    蒋介石继续破坏我方修堤
    残杀我员工抢劫我物资
    五天遭蒋机扫射死伤达六十三人
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】蒋机连日在黄河故道上空扫射我抢修堤坝员工及来往居民。一月二十八日上午，蒋机一架从西南方向飞来，至寿张孙口上空即横肆扫射，此时正有居民三十余人渡河，当被射死八人，因渡船着弹落水淹死二人，其余浮到岸旁又有二人冻死。三十日，郓北某村群众为自救而将破船修补下水。是日全村群众，齐集拉船，突有蒋机一架，盘旋上空，扫射达二十分钟，当射死群众四人，伤九人。该庄居民丁华方之十一岁幼女在院外观看，也被击断臂膀。三十一日，我黄委会孟段长率领员工百余人，在范县储洼抢修被冲刷之堤坝。上午十时蒋机窜至上空，扫射达一小时，工人李子义与修堤儿童储二小等十三人被射死，负伤十五人。二月一日，蒋机扫射孙口修堤的员工，被击毁大车四辆，击伤修堤员工三人。次日，又在孙口扫射，击毙车夫一人，牲口一头。扫射后又飞向寿张城南关上空，向赶集居民扫射，死一人，伤五人。郓北群众拾到蒋机丢下的弹壳上，有“Ｕ·Ｓ·Ａ”字样，他们见有美国字，更愤恨的说：“老百姓有啥罪过？老蒋这美国的干儿子放了水淹咱，还又下这样的毒手！”
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】蒋方放水后，我方抢修堤坝的员工又遭蒋军屠杀，并劫去抢修物资。一月十三日，我黄委会率领群众在南华马厂抢修河堤，忽有驻东明蒋军一部，开枪向员工扫射，当被打死六人，伤四人，并抢去修理麻绳六百余斤。群众极为愤怒，被击伤的修堤工人李二孩说：“老蒋是啥居心？他放了水还不让咱修堤，难道咱就叫活生生淹死不成？”
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】黄河水流到昆吾，沿河老百姓极为愤恨。黄河未改道时，因为蒋介石政府不好好修堤，沿河庄稼时常被淹，每年收的粮食不够吃。居民均东奔西跑，讨饭乞食。河民葛大爷说：“我二十多岁就搬了十八个地方，几乎年年逃亡流浪。庄稼种在水里，秋天收拾时，腿上脚上被庄稼秆子刷的不断流血，再加上蚊子一咬，就满身成疮。一年到头，可苦坏了！黄河改道后，八路军来了，大家才过了安生日子。可是蒋介石这孬孙，用兵杀不了，又想用水来淹咱，宁死也要和他拚！”黄水来后，有一妇女从海村往北河沿路探母亲，回来时无渡船，只得涉水过河，抵岸后即被冻死。二十四日有两位老头涉水过河，涉到当中，因受冻不过，倒在水里淹死。二十六日有南岸居民七八人，到北岸习成集赶集，因涉水全被冻死。四五天的时间，就害了三十多人。不知水大时要伤多少人。现在民主政府领导群众奋起自救，正赶造渡船。
