    Clearly Demarcate Class Boundaries, Eradicate Feudal Remnants: Wu'an Conducts In-Depth Land Investigation and Class Identification; Chengguan Mobilizes Backward Elements to Expose Feudal Remnants

    [Our Newspaper Wu'an News] The current central task of the mass movement in the Third District of this county is to clearly identify class and investigate land ownership; that is, on the one hand, to continue mobilizing backward elements and repeatedly investigate the feudal remnants hidden by landlords in every possible way; on the other hand, to check whether the distribution of land, property, and other fruits of the revolution is fair and reasonable to the masses, and whether the poor peasants have thoroughly overturned their situation, in order to ultimately and completely realize land reform. Regarding what constitutes a thorough movement, four standards are proposed: 1. Thorough land investigation and fair distribution. 2. Landlords cannot be active and cannot sabotage. 3. There are no backward elements, and 90% of the masses understand that the struggle is reasonable and legal. 4. The whole village has recognized leaders and a group of activists, and every member of the masses dares to express their opinions. Currently, all villages in the district are deepening the movement according to their own situations and striving towards these standards. (Ling)
    [Another Dispatch] Wu'an Chengguan launched a struggle to "investigate class, investigate land, and investigate remnants" before the Lantern Festival. First, more than 300 cadres and activists from the entire Chengguan gathered to examine their thinking and proposed "Think about the past, compare it to the present," which aroused everyone's memories. Cadres from various streets used various examples to illustrate the history of suffering of the poor. At the grievance meeting the next day, everyone vied to speak, especially the women, and the entire audience burst into tears. After the grievance, complacency and fatigue towards the struggle were broken, and class consciousness was greatly improved. The leadership immediately led the masses to launch a reasoning struggle against Li Xiyuan, a large landlord and local tyrant in the Fifth Street. First, his record of post-liberation activities was read aloud, which aroused everyone's anger even more. The leadership immediately proposed: "See if your street has a Li Xiyuan?" "Why is Li Xiyuan still able to be active?" Upon inspection, each street also had ten or eight, and some even had no struggle at all. Everyone realized that the past methods of struggle were simple and had not undergone a good reasoning struggle, so that the landlord truly lowered his head, the masses' ideological consciousness was not enough, and some backward elements harbored old wealthy people, and some even acted as "telephone poles" (informers). When studying the problem of backward elements, some said: "Whoever harbors them, confiscate their property," and some said: "These people are just disgracing the Peasants' Association, fight them once and drive them out." The leadership guided everyone to discuss and made everyone realize the formation of these backward people was mainly a leadership problem, because we had loopholes in our work, the cadres' style of work was not good enough, the distribution of fruits was unfair, and the landlords took advantage of the loopholes. If we adopt a打击打击attitude towards backward elements, it is exactly what the landlords welcome. When further examining "whether the wife and husband, parents and children are of one mind," the head of the Fifth Street said: "My three brothers have three different minds." The militia captain said: "I took back the fruits of the struggle, but my wife secretly returned them to others." This inspection made everyone more deeply realize the insidiousness of the landlords and the reasons for the existence of backward elements. Therefore, everyone clearly recognized that if there are backward elements, the struggle cannot be truly thorough, and the existence of backward elements provides a hiding place for feudal remnants. Then, discussing how to mobilize the backward elements, everyone believed that the best methods were: (1) Husband mobilizes wife, wife mobilizes husband, the whole family is of one mind, and then mobilize others; (2) Grasp the most painful thing for him and inspire his class consciousness; (3) Cultivate more activists, unite more people, and turn everyone into activists.
    After four days of meetings, everyone said: "In this way, there is no problem for the movement to be thoroughly carried out."

    划清阶级界线铲除封建残余  武安深入查田查阶级  城关发动落后层查出封建大尾巴
    【本报武安讯】本县三区群运当前中心，明确提出查阶级查土地；即一方面继续发动落后，反复清查地主千方百计隐藏的封建尾巴；一方面检查群众土地财物等果实分配是否公平合理，贫苦农民是否翻透身，以求最后彻底实现土地改革。关于怎样才算运动彻底，提出四个标准：一、彻底查田，分配公平。二、地主活动不开，破坏不了。三、没有落后分子，百分之九十群众都了解斗争是合理合法的。四、全村有公认的领袖有一团积极分子，每个群众都敢提意见。现全区各村正根据本村情况深入运动，向这样的标准努力。（凌）
    【又讯】武安城关于元宵节前展开“查阶级、查田、查尾巴”斗争。首先全城关干部积极分子三百余人集会，检查思想，提出“想想过去，比比现在”，引起大家回忆，各街干部用各种事例说明穷人的痛苦史。在第二天诉苦大会上，大家争相发言，尤其是妇女，全场痛哭失声。经过诉苦，打破自满与对斗争的疲惫情绪，阶级觉悟大为提高，当即领导群众对五街大地主、大恶霸李喜元展开说理斗争，首先把他的变天账读了一遍，更激起大家的气愤，领导当即提出：“看看你街有没有李喜元”？“为什么李喜元至今还能活动。”一检查，那个街也有十个八个，甚至还有根本没斗争的。大家都认识到过去斗争方式简单，没经过很好的说理斗争，使地主真正低下头来，群众思想觉悟不够，还有些落后分子包庇老财，还有人当“电线杆子”。在研究对落后分子问题时，有的说：“谁包庇就没收谁”，有的说：“这些人在平民会才是丢人败兴来，斗上一顿赶出去”。领导上就引导大家讨论，使大家认识了这些落后人的形成，主要是领导问题，因我们工作上有漏洞，干部作风不够好，果实分配不公，地主钻了空子，如果我们对落后分子采取打击态度，正为地主所欢迎。又进一步检查“老婆汉子、父母双亲是不是一条心”时，五街长说：“我弟兄三个三条心”。民兵队长说：“我拿回斗争果实，我老婆又偷的退给人啦”。这一检查，使大家更深刻的体会到地主的阴险，和落后层存在的原因。因此大家明确的认识了有落后分子，斗争就谈不到真正彻底，落后分子的存在，就给封建尾巴留下掩蔽处。接着讨论如何动员落后，大家认为最好的办法：（１）汉子动员老婆，老婆动员汉子，全家一条心，再去动员旁人；（２）抓住他最痛心的一件事，启发他的阶级觉悟；（３）培养更多的积极分子，团结更多的人，把每个人都变成积极的。
    经前后四天会议，都说：“这样，运动搞彻底，可不成问题啦”。
