[Report from this newspaper in Weixian on the 27th] Cadres in the first district of Xin County, at the district and village levels, are examining their thinking and establishing a new work style. The stage of mass development in Xin County's first district has passed, but the organizations in various villages are not sound or consolidated. In some villages, the fruits of labor have not yet been clearly distributed; some village cadres are still keeping the fruits for their own use, and some cadres have not yet returned the excess fruits they received. In order to completely and quickly distribute the fruits to the peasants and develop next year's production movement, cadres in each sub-district have been holding soul-searching meetings, distinguishing between districts and villages, to examine their thinking and establish a new work style. After this examination, the remaining work was quickly handled: In Ximiao, some middle peasants, individual old peasants, and poor peasants were excluded, and the fruits were not distributed according to the principle of "filling gaps and making up deficiencies," but rather to whoever participated. Furthermore, 500,000 yuan had not yet been distributed, resulting in dissatisfaction from those who did not participate and dissatisfaction from those who participated but did not receive the fruits. After this examination, it was unanimously agreed that excluding middle peasants, honest old peasants, and poor peasants and not distributing fruits to them was a sign of an unstable stance. They resolved to return to their villages and complete the task of distributing the fruits within three days. Tu Lou had just obtained 8,000 yuan from the families of those who had been struggled against. Village cadres spent 4,000 yuan on eating and drinking during a trip to the market in the city. Cadres of the Armed Committee in the fourth district took away some fruits while attending training at the branch, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, but they dared not speak out. After this examination, the village cadres confessed everything one by one and acknowledged that this was a serious mistake. They immediately collected money upon returning to the village to repay the masses and apologized to them. The Farmers' Association chairman of Lao Yan Village reflected, saying, "If we don't distribute a little more to our families, the adults and children at home won't be happy. However, if we eat and spend lavishly as soon as we distribute the fruits and don't work, will our families be happy? If we do whatever we want and criticize the masses if they don't follow our opinions, will the masses follow us? In the future, we must resolutely overcome these bad habits of being gluttonous, lazy, temperamental, and detached from the masses."

　　莘县一区召开反省会检讨思想
    区村干部树立新作风
    一、退出多分果实二、分配积存果实三、决不大吃大喝
    【本报威县廿七日电】莘县一区各小区、村干部检讨思想，树立新作风。莘县一区群众大发展阶段已过，但各村组织不健全不巩固，有的村果实还未分清，有的村干将果实还保存着自用，有的干部还未退出多分果实。为将果实完全迅速分到农民手里，以便发展明年生产运动。各小区干部分区分村，召开了检讨思想，树立新作风的反省会。经过这次反省后，遗留工作迅速处理：西庙部分中农，个别老农贫农，被关到门外，分果实不按填平补齐办法，而是谁参加，分给谁，并且还有五十万元未分，结果未参加的不满；参加的没得到果实也不满。经过这次反省，一致认为把中农老实贫农关到门外，不分给人家果实，是立场不稳，决心回村，三天以里完成分果实任务。土楼刚从被斗户家得来八千元，村干进城里赶集一次吃喝四千元，四区村武委会干部到分会受训带走部分果实花了，群众知道了不满，但不敢言。经过这次反省，村干都一一坦白了，并认为这是严重的错误，回村马上集款分还群众，并向群众认错。老阎庄农会长反省说：“不多分点东西，家里大人孩子不喜欢，但是，刚分点果实，就大吃大花啦，也不干活啦，家里人会喜欢吗？咱们愿怎样就怎样，群众如不随咱的意见就批评他，群众会跟咱走吗？今后要坚决克服这好吃懒做耍脾气、脱离群众的坏现象。”
