    Taiyue, February 13th (from our newspaper) Gaoping has launched a campaign to inspect the "three incompletes." The reason is that in 22 natural villages, including Mishan in the county, the filling-in process had three shortcomings: the feudal vestiges were not completely eradicated, the fruits of the struggle were not thoroughly distributed, and a few gaps were not filled. These 22 villages underwent a vigorous filling-in and rectification campaign for more than a month last winter, achieving "land to the tiller." However, during the Lantern Festival celebration of the return of land to the farmers, it was discovered that many farmers were asking village cadres to continue the struggle. For example, Yuan Shengsun, a farmer in Mishan, said to the village cadres, "I haven't completely turned over yet. Can I still struggle against feudalism in the future?" In this village, village cadres had shielded the奸霸 (jianba - treacherous tyrant) Song Songsheng, hiding several houses. The land returned to the farmers had old contracts not burned and new contracts not established. In Pangcun, the feudal aspects of two former rich peasant households had also not been settled. Except for Mishan and two other villages, the fruits of the struggle in the remaining 19 villages were still not thoroughly distributed, especially as the village offices still retained some grain, quilts, and other supplies. Therefore, a few households were missed and not made whole. For example, Yang Xicai from Mishan village, who had served in the army for nine years and is now returning home injured, has not been allocated a single tile or inch of land. Wu Baochang from Pangcun is destitute, served in the army for nine years, and also not left any housing or land. The main key to the above three incomplete phenomena lies in the "close enough" mentality of the village cadres and their unclear mass perspective. Therefore, the entire county decided to conduct another in-depth review, door-to-door, before the spring plowing to check on the "two incompletes."
    Jinan, February 13th (from our newspaper) In Wu'yi's查灭 (chamiè - investigate and exterminate) campaign, many conspiracies by overlooked landlords and despots to resist the struggle were smashed by the masses. Many evil despotic landlords in the fourth district tried every means to avoid the struggle. Initially, they used threats to suppress the masses. When they saw that the masses were organized and especially that the broad middle peasants were participating in the struggle, they switched to using soft methods to resist. Some "offered land" in an attempt to缓和 (huanhe - mitigate) the struggle. Some bought off backward elements to hide things, some pretended to divide their families, and some attacked and won over activists and their families, and so on. Gen Sheng of Liangjiawu was used by the landlord in the first mass movement to hide things for the landlord. This time, reflecting, he said: "In the past, I hid things for the landlord and bought livestock together, saying it was my own, and he was going to give me land. After the movement was over, he started calculating the accounts with me. I will never be fooled again this time." Before the struggle, many landlords asked farmers to hide things. After串联 (chuanlian - linking up) and education, most of the farmers became aware and turned everything over. Li Fengtong, a young soldier who returned home to recuperate, actively helped the peasants turn over. One day, the landlord Li Fu'an bought him two roast chickens and a bottle of wine. During the struggle against Li Fu'an, he put the roast chicken and wine on the table and questioned Li Fu'an: "Why did you buy this for me?" The landlord said: "Because you are sick." He then asked: "Why didn't you buy it for me for more than three months since I came home, but you bought it for me during the struggle?" Then the landlord told the truth: it turned out that he heard that Li Fengtong was going to give him advice. At the meeting, the masses shouted: "Resolutely do not be used by the landlord, learn from Comrade Li Fengtong!" Liu Yonghan of Zhangjia Yuan Village in Guandong Third District once led tenants in a struggle against the landlord. In the spring of the year before last, after being elected as the chairman of the farmers' association, the landlord tried every means to use the masses and cadres, seized on a few shortcomings of Liu Yonghan, and dismissed him, electing Zhang Liye, a lackey of the landlord. During this great review of turning over, the deceived masses in the village became aware and re-elected Liu Yonghan as the director. First, they struggled against Ren Xianzhang, the landlord's most loyal lackey. He confessed the facts of the landlord's bribery with money, intimidation with变天 (biàntiān - a drastic political change), and seduction with beautiful women. Then seven or eight lackeys automatically confessed and jointly struggled against the landlord, defeating the feudal forces. In the whole village of 108 households and 578 people, land was supplemented to more than five mu per person, and 34 mu were given to those with surplus land in other villages.

    高平深入复查
    武邑粉碎地主恶霸阴谋
    尾巴是否彻底割掉？
    果实是否彻底分配？
    窟窿是否彻底填平？
    【本报太岳十三日电】高平掀起检查三不彻底运动。原因是该县米山等二十二个自然村，在填补中有三不彻底。即封建尾巴没有完全割掉，斗争果实没有彻底分配，少数窟窿没有填平。这廿二个村庄去冬曾经过月余轰轰烈烈的填平补齐运动，实现了耕者有其田。但在元宵节庆祝土地还家，发现了不少农民向村干部要要求斗争。如米山农民袁盛孙向村干部说：“我还没有翻透身，以后还能斗封建不能？”这村在斗争中村干部曾包庇过奸霸宋松生，隐藏着几间房子，退给农民的土地，旧契未焚新契未立；庞村有两户旧富农的封建部分也未被清算。两基点除米山等三村外，其余十九个村庄斗争果实仍末彻底分配，特别是各村公所仍存留部分粮食、被子及其他用具。因此漏下少数窟窿户未能补齐。如米山村杨喜才参军九年，现负伤还家，未给分配片瓦寸地，庞村吴保昌是个赤贫，参军九年，亦未留给房地。上述三种不彻底的现象，主要关键在于村干部的“差不多”思想，和群众观点不明确，因此全县决定在春耕前再来一次挨门挨户的深入复查，检查二不彻底。
    【本报冀南十三日电】武邑查灭运动中，许多遗漏地主、恶霸抵抗斗争的阴谋被群众粉碎。四区很多恶霸地主，千方百计躲避斗争，初用威吓镇压群众，当看到群众组织起来特别广大中农都参加斗争后，就换软法抵抗。有的“献田”，企图缓和斗争，有的收买落后分子运藏东西，有的假分家，有的进攻拉拢积极分子和其家庭等等。良家务根生，在第一次群运中，受地主利用给地主藏东西，这次反省说：“过去我给地主藏东西，伙着买牲口，说是我自己的，他又当给我地，运动过去，他就给我算起账来了，这次我再也不上当了。”不少地主在斗争前，叫农民收藏东西，经过串连教育，大部农民觉悟，都把东西交出。回家养病的青年军人李凤同，积极帮助农民翻身，一天地主李福安买了两只烧鸡一瓶酒给他送去，在斗争李福安时，他把烧鸡和酒放在桌子上，质问李福安：“为什么给我买这个？”地主说：“因你有病。”又问：“为什么我回家三个多月你不给我买，在斗争时给我买？”然后地主才说了实话：原来是听到李凤同要给他提意见。会上群众高呼：“坚决不受地主利用，向李凤同同志学习！”关东三区张家院村刘永汉，曾领导佃户对地主作过斗争，前年春被选为农会主任以后，地主便千方百计的利用群众与干部，抓住刘永汉的一点缺点把他撤职，另选上地主的走狗张立业。这次翻身大检查中，该村被骗群众觉悟，随又选了刘永汉主任，首先斗了一个地主最忠实的走狗任宪章。他坦白出地主对他金钱贿买、变天威吓、美女引诱等事实，接着七八个走狗，自动坦白，共同向地主进行斗争，把封建势力打垮了。全村一百零八户，五百七十八人，土地补地到每人五亩以上，下余者还赠送外村三十四亩。
