　　Neiqiu's Experience in the Fill-in-the-Gaps Movement
    Neiqiu Joint Office
    I. The Training and Mobilization of Poor and Hired Peasants
    The Fill-in-the-Gaps movement is a review of the land reform movement after several climaxes. Filling in the gaps is to fill in for all the masses who have not yet turned over, especially the honest (backward) poor and hired peasants. Therefore, in terms of guiding ideology, we must mobilize the backward masses. The so-called backward masses are mostly poor and hired peasants who have been deeply affected by feudal exploitation and rule, and who are bound by their conscience and fate, and are not easily awakened for a while. In the Fill-in-the-Gaps movement in Neiqiu, the poor and hired peasants were first trained. In the training, everyone checked their attitude towards turning over and eliminating feudal forces. They also checked the leadership and work style of cadres, broke through ideological obstacles, and boldly let go in leadership. The poor and hired peasants then, in the posture of masters, launched and promoted the movement, giving the feudal forces a ruthless and fatal blow. At the same time, they united and mobilized the broad masses of middle peasants and reformed the cadres. In solving the internal problems of the peasants and stabilizing the emotions of the middle peasants, and uniting the broad masses of middle peasants, a village in Neiqiu widely adopted the method of holding family meetings (except for those who were struggled against) to carry out mass discussions and inspections, and raised the question of whether the land reform in our village had been thorough, who was the target of the inspection, and where did the things to be filled in come from? Everyone discussed it. The honest peasant Hao Migui said well, "In the past, the world was like this: the poor are not busy, the rich are not busy, and the two household masters (middle peasants) are running around, and the middle peasants are also exploited." The old man Su Hongzi said, "A family that is not harmonious is bullied by outsiders. The middle peasants and us are one family, and we cannot fight ourselves." Su Futai said, "The feudal forces in our village are gone, there is nothing to fill in. If we lack clothes, we must spin and weave well. If we lack food and furniture, we must organize production and earn money to buy them. We cannot fight our own family members." After repeated debates, everyone said that the opinions of comrades such as Hao Migui were correct, breaking the middle peasants' concerns about being struggled against, uniting the middle peasants, making the middle peasants feel that they could participate in the meeting and discussion, and that they were one family with the poor and hired peasants, which was very pleasant. The poor and hired tenants felt that they had a backing, isolating the feudal forces and making them unable to take advantage of them. After breaking through their thinking, they carried out a massive inspection from top to bottom, from individuals to groups, and from groups to the entire masses. In the thorough investigation of the feudal struggle, if the emotions of the middle peasants are not stabilized and the thinking is not united in advance, it will disrupt the camp and help the middle peasants' equal distribution of property ideas. After the thinking is united, the poor and middle peasants unite to isolate the feudal forces, so that they can fight hard and accurately, and not hit their own people.
    Experience proves that only by mobilizing the poor and hired peasants can the anti-feudal movement be thorough, and only then will there be backbone in the masses, and the work of filling in the gaps can be carried out truly and thoroughly along with the ideological awakening of the poor and hired peasants and all the peasants who have not yet turned over, and the feudal system can be eliminated. Only then can we overcome the work style of cadres and activists monopolizing the movement. However, we should also do a good job in breaking through the thinking of village cadres, so that the cadres can support the poor and hired peasants and be their masters, rather than forming an opposition between the poor and hired peasants and the village cadres. Therefore, the training of poor and hired peasants is the primary key to mobilizing and carrying out the Fill-in-the-Gaps movement.
    II. The Problem of Engaging Hidden Property
    Filling in the gaps is to cut off the feudal tails and fill the holes of the poor. After several climaxes of the movement, engaging hidden property is one of the main contents of the struggle in the movement. However, engaging hidden property is a life-and-death struggle between the peasants and the landlords. The landlords will clench their teeth and resist stubbornly. Experience proves that a large amount of hidden property cannot be obtained without letting go, in order to fill in the gaps. As long as we aim at the main and stubborn remnants of feudalism, the masses will be able to do it, but we must master the tactics. After a mass and thorough investigation and correct judgment, the leadership must be firm in its position on engaging hidden property. If the landlord does not take out the buried fruits to repay the masses' debts, the masses will not take care of them. At this time, it must be emphasized that the first shot must be fired to influence the general, combined with mobilization, to produce buried fruits. After the fruits are produced, they must be exhibited, which will increase the masses' confidence in victory, and the emotions will become higher and higher. If the preliminary investigation and research work is not enough, and the landlord resists stubbornly, the masses' emotions will gradually decline, and other landlords will also clench their teeth and try to preserve their capital for counterattack. At the same time, it has been proven in the movement that only by getting out the landlord's hidden property, that is, by getting rid of his counterattack capital, will the landlord be convinced and be able to change and follow the masses.

　　内邱填补运动经验
    内邱联合办公室
    贫雇的训练与发动问题
    填平补齐运动，是在经过几次运动高潮后的翻身大检查运动。填补是向一切没有翻身的群众，特别是老实（落后）的贫雇进行填补。所以在领导思想上必须面向落后群众进行发动。所谓落后群众，大都是受封建剥削统治最深，而受良心命运束缚，一时不容易觉悟的贫雇农。内邱在填平补齐运动中，首先训练了贫雇农，在训练中每个人检查了翻身与封建势力的消灭态度。也检查了领导与干部作风，打破了思想上的障碍，领导上大胆地放手，贫雇农便以主人翁的姿态，掀起了与推动着运动，给予封建势力以无情的致命的打击。同时也团结了与发动了广大中农改造了干部，内邱某村在解决农民内部问题和安定中农情绪，团结广大中农上，广泛的采取召开家庭会议方式，（除被斗户都参加）开展群众性的讨论检查，提出咱村翻身是否已彻底了，检查的目标对准谁，补的东西从那里来？由大家讨论。老实农民郝米贵说的好，过去世道是：穷不忙，富不忙，二户主子（中农）跑断肠，中农同样受剥削。老年苏红子说：“家道不和人外欺，中农和咱是一家人，自己不能斗自己。”苏福太说：“咱村封建势力不沾了，没头补了，缺衣要好好纺织，缺粮缺家具要组织生产，赚下钱来置，也不能斗自己家人。”经过再三争论都说郝米贵等同志的意见对，打破了中农怕斗的顾虑，团结了中农，使中农感到能参加会讨论，和贫雇农是一家人，很痛快。贫雇佃感到有了靠山，孤立起封建势力，使其无隙可乘。打通思想后，开展自上而下由个人到小组，由小组到全面群众性的大检查。在彻底清查封建猛然斗争中，如不稳定中农情绪，事先打通思想团结中农，就要斗乱阵营，会助长中农的均产思想，打通思想后，中贫农团结起来孤立起封建势力，才能打的痛、打的准、也不至打着自己人。
    经验证明：只有把贫雇农发动起来，反封建运动才能彻底，群众中才有骨干，填平补齐工作才能随着贫雇及一切没有翻身农民的思想觉悟，进行真正彻底的消灭封建。才能克服了干部积极分子包办运动的作风。但亦应很好的打通村干部的思想，使干部很好给贫雇撑腰作主，而不是形成贫雇与村干部的对立。因之贫雇农的训练是发动为开展填平补齐运动的首要关键。
    二、搞隐蔽财产的问题
    填平补齐，是割封建尾巴，填穷人的窟窿。凡在经过几次运动高潮后，来搞隐蔽财产，乃为运动中主要斗争内容之一。但搞隐蔽财产，是农民与地主的生死斗争，地主会咬紧牙关，顽强对抗。经验证明：不放手是不能搞出大量隐蔽财产，来进行填平补齐的。只要对准主要的顽强的封建残余，群众是会搞的，但要掌握策略，经过群众性的周密的调查与正确的判断后，领导上搞隐蔽财产立场要坚定，地主不拿出埋藏果实来偿还群众的账，群众是不会照顾的，这时必须强调第一炮要打响，拿第一炮去影响一般，结合动员，搞出埋藏果实。搞出果实后，要进行展览，这会提高群众胜利信心，情绪会越斗越高。如果事前调查研究工作不够，遇着地主顽强对抗，群众情绪逐渐低落下去，其他地主也会咬紧牙关，而图保守他的反攻本钱。同时在运动中证明了只有将地主的隐蔽财产搞出来，即是将他的反攻本钱搞掉了，地主才会服气，才能变跟着群众去。
