    Learning the Mass Line from Grade Evaluation
    ——A Study Experience
    Wang Hua
    I. Revising Suitable Standards Based on Reality
    After a period, factories must evaluate workers' grades and provide remuneration based on their skills.
    Our factory has always based grade evaluation solely on skills. Since going down the mountain last year, due to peacetime construction, there has been a severe shortage of technical personnel. Coupled with the wave of opposition to the "Anti-Japanese War burden" at the time, technical skills were overemphasized, almost to the point of a purely technical perspective. Regardless of whether you were an old or new worker, a leader or a subordinate (such as a foreman or a regular worker), this led to two biases:
    First, some people with skills were mischievous and didn't work properly. They would emphasize difficulties and demand good materials and new tools from the factory to guarantee quality, but they didn't apply their skills to their work. This made people feel that "people with skills are difficult to lead." Yet, these people would still be promoted during grade evaluations.
    Second, some people had a sense of responsibility and the ability to organize production, and their presence often made it easier to increase output. However, due to reasons such as insufficient physical strength, their individual output was not high, and naturally, they could not be promoted.
    To overcome these biases, in July of last year, we boldly revised the grading standards, adding "work attitude" as an item in addition to skills. We divided workers from foreman to trainee into four grades, with different requirements for each grade. We clearly defined "skills" as "work ability," so people with the ability to organize production were considered to have skills.
    After this standard was announced, mischievous people themselves said at the meeting, "I can't be promoted because my attitude is not good." Moreover, during discussions at the factory department meeting, some comrades, although not promoted, felt that their attitude was not good and that they should correct it, so they worked very actively. After the standard was determined, it was democratically discussed among the workers, using a show of hands. For example, someone would propose: "XXX should be promoted to what grade." The chairman would say: "Those who agree, raise your hand." Some people initially disagreed, but under the gaze of the crowd, they also raised their hands. The factory department clearly knew that this worker should not be promoted, but the democratic opinion was to promote him. If the factory department negated this, the workers would be unhappy and would have opinions about the factory department. Therefore, although this standard was well-researched and had great educational significance, it did not follow the mass line, and even if the factory department's decision represented the correct opinion, it failed to satisfy the masses.
    II. Evaluating Grades by Following the Mass Line
    This year in January, grade evaluations were to be conducted again. Everyone first agreed to continue using the standard revised in July of last year. However, there were three problems at the time: (1) Discussing with dozens of people together made some people afraid to speak, and it took a long time, making people feel tired; (2) Good words (advantages) were easy to say, but shortcomings were difficult to express; (3) A show of hands could not represent everyone's true opinion. Based on the above three points, it was decided to divide into small groups of ten or so people, with each group jointly discussing one person. After the meeting, the factory department would synthesize everyone's opinions into a complete opinion. The person being discussed would leave the meeting during the discussion, and the factory department would convey everyone's opinions to the person concerned later. If they disagreed, they could state their reasons. After the discussion, a general meeting would be held to announce the results publicly. Then, a secret ballot would be conducted.
    This method was indeed good, because the person concerned was not present, so people said what they needed to say, eliminating the hypocrisy of having to say many advantages first. Instead, everyone spoke about the other person's shortcomings they had observed, one after another. When two groups discussed the same person at the same time, even if they had not communicated beforehand, their opinions were often similar. After the factory department conveyed the opinions to the person concerned, some people did not accept them. At this time, even comrades who were unwilling to speak at the general meeting would speak up, because they had already spoken in the group meeting, breaking the ice. After everyone and the comrade who had received comments fully agreed, a secret ballot was conducted. The grades written on everyone's ballots were very reasonable. If someone should not be promoted, it was written that they should not be promoted. The factory department almost completely approved each person's grade according to the opinions of the masses. Everyone was very satisfied with this grade evaluation. Many people also felt that they had these shortcomings and immediately corrected them. One person was criticized for going home too often, which affected his work, so he reduced the number of times he went home and said, "No one has ever given me such feedback before. I know my shortcomings and will correct them immediately." All the workers in the factory received a half-year evaluation in this grade evaluation. This evaluation was based on the opinions of the masses and agreed upon by the person concerned. In the future, every worker in our factory will receive such a mass evaluation every half year, so that they can often look in the mirror and move forward.

    从评定等级中学到群众路线
    ——业务学习心得
    王华
    一、从实际出发改定合适的标准
    工厂里过了一个时期，一定要评定一次工人的等级，根据技术发给报酬。
    我们工厂里从来评定等级只根据技术为标准，自从去年下山以后，因为和平建设，技术人员太缺，加之当时在反对“抗战包袱”的浪潮下，更强调技术，几乎成了单纯的技术的观点，不管你是老工友新工友，也不管你是领导者或被领导者（如工人中的领班与普遍工人），因而产生了两种偏向：
    第一种，有技术，调皮倒蛋，不好好工作，更有强调困难，要他保证质量，他就向厂方要什么好材料、新工具，好技术用不到工作上，使人感到：“人有了技术就难领导了”。可是像这种人，评定等级时还会升级。
    第二种，工作有责任感，有组织生产能力，如有这种人在，往往易于提高产量。但他本人因为体力不足等原因，数量不高，当然也就不能升级。
    为了克服这种偏向，在去年七月我们评定等级时，大胆修改了评级标准，除技术外，又加上了“工作态度”一项，并把从领班到练习生分为四等，对各等人要求各有不同，把“技术”两个字明确的解释为“工作能力”，因此，组织生产有办法的人，也就成了有技术了。
    这个标准宣布后，调皮的人自己在会上说：“我不能升，因为态度不好”。且在厂部的会上讨论时，有同志虽未升级，但自感平时态度不好，应该好好改正，工作非常积极。标准确定后，就在工友中民主讨论，用的方法是举手表决。比如：有一个人提出：×××该升到什么级。主席说：同意举手。有些人本来不同意，但在众目睽睽之下，也举了手。厂部明明知道这个工友不该升，民主意见要升，厂部把他否定了，工友不痛快，对厂部就有了意见。所以，这次标准虽然研究得很好，也起了很大教育意义，但因为没有走好群众路线，即或厂部的决定代表了正确意见，但并未能为群众所满意。
    二、走群众路线来评定等级
    今年一月又要评定等级了，大家首先同意标准仍用去年七月改订后的那个。但当时有三个问题：（１）好几十个人在一起讨论，有的人不敢发言，且占时间久，嫌疲劳；（２）好话（优点）易说，缺点讲不出口；（３）举手表决不能代表各人真实意见。根据上述三点，决定分十来个人一小组，各小组共同讨论一个人，会后，由厂部把大家意见综合起来，成为一个完整意见。讨论谁时谁就退席，将来由厂部把大家意见转给本人，如不同意，还可以声明理由。讨论完后，再开大会，当众宣布。然后进行不记名投票。
    这个办法果然好，因为本人不在，该说什么就说什么，把过去说话非要先说许多优点的虚伪客套话取消了。而把平时看到对方的缺点，你一言我一语的都说了出来。两个组同时讨论一个人，虽然事先没有打通，说的往往差不多。厂部把意见转达给本人后，有的人不接受，这时即使在大会上不愿发言的同志也要发言了，因为自己已经在小组会上说过了，打破了情面。待大家及被提意见的同志完全同意后，再进行不记名投票。大家票上写着的等级都很合理，不能升就写不升，厂部差不多完全依照群众意见批准各人等级，这次评等级都很满意。有许多人还感到自己有这些缺点，马上纠正。有一个人大家批评他回家太勤，影响工作，他就减少回家次数，并说：“从来大家没有这样给我提过意见，我知道了自己的缺点，马上要改。”全厂的工友们，在这次评定等级中，都等于作了一个半年鉴定，而这鉴定是群众意见又经本人同意的，今后我们工厂里每个工友每半年就要得到这样一次群众鉴定，使他常常能够照镜子，向前进。
