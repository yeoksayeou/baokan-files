Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th. A platoon of officers and soldiers from the Jiang Army's 65th Division raped family members and relatives of Sun Lixin, the former 33rd Division commander of the Jiang Army's Han Deqin's troops. Among the victims were Sun's 50-year-old eighth aunt, his 18-year-old cousin, his brother Sun Liwen's wife, and several cousins' wives, totaling five people. Many more distant relatives were also raped. Division Commander Sun's home is in Sunxinzhuang, located four or five miles north of Lianshui city, on the west bank of the Yanhua River. On January 8th, when the Jiang Army passed through, his family did not flee because they were considered "one of their own." When the Jiang Army broke into their residence, the family immediately presented the memorial tablet of the deceased as proof of being "one of their own." Because the tablet contained the name of Division Commander Sun, the Jiang Army said, "It's even better that you're one of our own; your family is the same outside," and then forcibly gang-raped them collectively in a courtyard. Afterward, Division Commander Sun's second sister-in-law wept bitterly. His younger brother Li Yi's wife, after being defiled, became mentally deranged due to excessive shame and anger. She is now delirious, refusing to eat or sleep, and cries out "Help, help!" day and night. After hearing the news, the local democratic government immediately sent personnel to express their condolences.

　　蒋军孙师长家人亦遭蒋军轮奸
    【新华社华中十三日电】蒋军六十五师官兵一个排，轮奸蒋军前韩德勤部三十三师师长孙礼信之家属族人，其中有孙之五十岁的八婶母。十八岁的叔伯妹妹，亲弟孙礼文之妻及堂兄弟媳等五人，其远房亲属被奸者亦有多人，孙师长家住涟水城北四五里盐河西岸的孙新庄。一月八日，蒋军过境时，其家人以“自家人”，故未逃避，蒋军闯入其住宅时，全家人即拿出亡人牌作为“自家人”的证据，因牌子中有孙师长的名字，蒋军说：“自家人更好，你家人在外也是这样的”，遂在一院子内强行集体轮奸。事后，孙师长的二弟媳痛哭流涕，他把弟礼仪之妻被污辱后，因羞恼过度，已成痴迷不吃不睡，日夜惊呼“救命救命”。当地民主政府闻讯后，即派员前往慰问。
