　　Chiang Kai-shek Harbors Sinister Intentions
　　Plotting to Detain Our Personnel Stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] According to various indications, Chiang Kai-shek is preparing, after the CCP representatives and staff of the Beiping Executive Headquarters have withdrawn, to attempt to detain CCP personnel stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing through various means. Chiang Kai-shek has twice inquired, through Ambassador Stuart and Pi Zongkan, whether the CCP's Nanjing Liaison Office would withdraw the liaison personnel from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. Pi Zongkan even used the excuse of "the government needing the houses" to ask whether the CCP liaison personnel stationed in Nanjing would withdraw. At the same time, CCP personnel in Beiping who have been transferred from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing should, according to the original procedure, retreat to Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the Chiang faction representative of the Beiping Executive Headquarters actually refused to guarantee their safety. Such actions, and the two inquiries in Nanjing, all show that the Chiang Kai-shek government is attempting to force CCP liaison personnel to withdraw voluntarily. However, when CCP personnel asked whether the government had decided that CCP personnel should withdraw, they all avoided answering. The CCP spokesperson in Yan'an stated: The establishment and existence of the CCP liaison offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were previously requested by both Chiang and the US, and permitted by Chiang. Their task is to liaise with all parties, both Chinese and foreign, including the UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Unless the Chiang faction is determined to no longer negotiate from now on and formally notifies the CCP to withdraw these organizations, or the CCP decides to withdraw on its own, there is absolutely no reason to cancel them.
　　Since the CCP advocates that if Chiang Kai-shek acknowledges the restoration of the military positions of January 13th and cancels the bogus constitution, it will certainly not decide to withdraw the liaison personnel from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. Now, the Chiang faction is using various excuses to force CCP personnel to withdraw voluntarily. If this fails, they are prepared to deal with CCP liaison personnel through the insidious means of framing them with secret agent tactics and secret arrests. Such means are extremely base and despicable, and are sufficient to show their determination to close the door to peace talks. If the Chiang faction neither formally notifies the CCP to withdraw, but also dares to conspire to detain CCP personnel, then the Chiang faction should bear full responsibility for all consequences.

　　蒋介石包藏祸心
    图扣我驻京沪渝人员
    【新华社延安二十日电】据各种迹象证明，蒋介石准备于北平执行部中共代表及工作人员撤完后，企图以各种手段达到扣押中共驻南京、上海、重庆三处人员之目的。蒋介石已两次经过司徒大使与皮宗阚询问中共南京联络处是否撤退京沪渝三处联络人员，皮宗阚则以“政府要用房子”为理由，问中共驻京联络人员是否撤退。同时，北平中共人员有自京沪渝三处调用者，按原定手续应向京沪撤退；乃北平执行部蒋方代表竟拒绝保证他们安全。似此行动，及南京两次询问，都显出蒋介石政府企图逼迫中共联络人员自动撤走。但当中共人员问以是否政府决定中共人员撤走时，则皆避而不答。延安中共发言人称：京沪渝三地中共联络处之设立与存在，以前皆为蒋美双方所请求及蒋方所许可者，其任务为与中外各方联络，包括与联总、行总联络在内，除非蒋方决心从此以后再不谈判，正式通知中共撤退此等机关，或中共方面自行决定撤回，则决无取消之理。
    中共方面既然主张如果蒋介石承认恢复一月十三日军事位置及取消伪宪法，当然不会决定撤退京沪渝联络人员。现在蒋方以种种借口逼迫中共人员自动撤退，不成功则准备以特务的嫁祸手段与秘密逮捕来对付中共联络人员，这种手段卑鄙下流已极，适足以表示他们决心关死和谈之门。如果蒋方既不正式通知中共方面撤退，还要胆敢阴谋扣捕中共人员，则一切后果自应由蒋方完全负责。
