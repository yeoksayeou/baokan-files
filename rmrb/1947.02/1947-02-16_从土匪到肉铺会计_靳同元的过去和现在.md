　　From Bandit to Butcher Shop Accountant
    Jin Tongyuan's Past and Present
    ·Er Dong·
    If it weren't confirmed by Jin Tongyuan himself, I would hardly believe he had ever been a bandit. He is now an accountant at the Zhao Zhuang Cooperative butcher shop in Wu'an. He puts down his abacus and picks up a butcher knife, puts down the butcher knife and picks up the fire tongs, constantly moving in and out, so busy that he rarely even goes to watch the lively opera performances during the New Year. Clearly, he is a very diligent and capable worker. When he speaks, his eyes dart around, revealing kindness and timidity. He can endure all kinds of taunts and ridicule and gets along with everyone. People therefore call him Old Honest. How could such a person be a bandit?

    However, when I spoke with him personally and with the village cadre, and learned that he had indeed gambled, used drugs, and been a bandit in the past, I couldn't help but doubt again: Could this transformation be lasting? So, I further investigated his life.

    "People only do bad things when they have no other choice!" When I asked Jin Tongyuan why he became a bandit, both he and the people around him told me this. They cited the example of the Li Grelu and Li Gexun brothers, bandits from this area who were previously captured and killed by the landlord: "They couldn't afford the levies, and the head of the bao took away all the dumplings they steamed for the New Year. Seeing that they were about to starve to death, what wouldn't they dare to do? Everything was dark, who could dream of having today! Just live one day at a time, and if you lose your head, so be it!"

    Since he was young, Jin Tongyuan followed his father to cultivate that meager nine mu of land and was originally very hardworking and enduring. During the agricultural off-season, he carried peppercorns, handled mountain goods, and helped his father run the butcher shop, slaughtering pigs and sheep, never leaving the heated brick bed from morning to night. However, most of the earnings from his labor went to pay levies. The family had to eat bran and vegetables and wear tattered clothes. After his father died, things became even harder. He and Jin Shiyuan co-founded a butcher shop. Earning money was already difficult, but Jin Shiyuan took four-fifths of the profits (his excuse was that it was money he borrowed, but the interest was paid by the shop). Unable to earn money and pay levies, the nine mu of land was also sold. "My mother was sick, my wife was crying, it was truly agonizing!"

    "What thrived in the old society was 'imperialism,' and they were considered heads of the community. How could we dare to provoke them?" Jin Tongyuan recalled: "The butcher shop couldn't be run, and I had no intention of running it anymore. I had no capital to do anything else. With no path to take, I took a small path! At first, it was gambling, and then I started doing everything!"

    "When Li Gexun took me to rob, my mother was already very ill, my wife wanted to spin cotton but had no money to buy any, and my children were crying from hunger. I thought: If I don't do it, I'll die anyway, so let's do it. While walking to the other person's house, my heart was pounding. What kind of ending would I have!"

    "That was the only time I did it, and it wasn't even successful. They noticed, and a fight broke out. Two guns short didn't help, and we fired two shots and ran away. I couldn't stay in the village either, so I had to run away that night. After going out, I felt relieved, knowing I couldn't succeed and wouldn't do it again. I gritted my teeth and resolved to turn over a new leaf, no matter what, I would find a legitimate job."

    This poor man, to escape the landlord's capture, the encirclement of drugs, and a hellish life, once ran to Tonghui Village south of Wu'an City, wanting to join the puppet security force. When he discovered that all twelve puppet soldiers at that stronghold were opium addicts, he borrowed six yuan for travel expenses and ran to Tunliu. But Tunliu had even more drugs than Wu'an, so he ran to Anze to work as a farmhand.

    In the winter of 1945, he heard that his hometown had completely changed: the evil landlords had been overthrown, there were no drugs, the poor had land to cultivate, and the levies were very light. He was overjoyed, but he didn't dare to return. He asked someone to contact the village cadres, vowing to turn over a new leaf, and said they could drive him out again if his words and actions didn't match. The village cadres, in turn, guaranteed to the masses that he would change. Finally, in March of last year, he returned to his long-lost hometown.

    The peasant association allocated him five mu of good land, three rooms, pots, bowls, furniture, everything. He and his former wife and children started working hard from dawn till dusk. In June, the mutual aid team elected him as the team leader, and later the peasant association also elected him as the team leader. In the two militia participation battles in July and September, he automatically carried his gun to the front. In the autumn, when the cooperative needed someone to run the butcher shop, the masses found him again. During the winter land investigation and the struggle to cut off the landlord's "tails," he was an activist. Recently, during the allocation of land and houses, he was allocated another five mu of good land and exchanged for a good house, and he was publicly elected as a councilor. Everyone says that he is now "truly changed."

    "At first, how did you dare to guarantee that he wouldn't do bad things again?" I asked the village cadres. The village cadres seemed to take it very calmly. They simply said, "Do bad things again? The masses won't allow it!"

    "Won't he run away with the money he earns?"

    "Where would he run to? The Eighth Route Army's methods are everywhere! His tricks won't work anywhere!"

    "Won't he run to the Kuomintang side?"

    "He won't run! He has such a good life here!"

    On the ninth day of the first lunar month, I went to Jin Tongyuan's house for a chat. His wife, wearing brand new cotton clothes, was making dumplings with her mother. The filling was all mutton. His seventeen-year-old son, handsome and sturdy, was taking care of the coal fire. The house was bright and warm. When I declined the dumplings they offered me, Jin Tongyuan said, "In the past, when you came to my house, even if you asked to eat, I wouldn't give it to you, because I didn't have enough myself! This year, you came, and you must eat!"

    While eating dumplings, he started talking about last year's production. Although the harvests in summer and autumn weren't good, he still harvested three or four shi of grain and sixty to seventy jin of cotton. After the autumn butcher shop season, he received 80,000 yuan in dividends (the butcher shop made 1 million yuan on a capital of 260,000 yuan). And his tax burden was only 20 jin of rice. Compared to the past, when one mu of land yielded two silver dollars (equivalent to two dou of rice, sixty jin), nine mu yielded eighteen yuan, which is twenty-seven times lighter. His wife spun and wove cotton year-round, enough to provide clothing. He praised his wife for spinning quickly and weaving well, and his wife praised him for being "good at plowing, sowing, hoeing, harrowing, slaughtering pigs and sheep, bookkeeping, and calculating everything!" Even his mother-in-law and son, who were usually expressionless, couldn't help but smile secretly.

    Jin Tongyuan said that if they run the butcher shop again in the autumn, he doesn't plan to take dividends. I asked him if he was really willing to sacrifice, and he said, "The Eighth Route Army is sacrificing their lives at the front, what is my little bit?" This is a common and effective way to resolve disputes when the masses in Zhao Zhuang argue over personal interests. When Jin Tongyuan said this, he added with emotion, "Without the Eighth Route Army, even if there were a hundred Jin Tongyuans, they would be eaten by dogs!" He pointed to all the furniture, tables, chairs, cabinets, and jars in the house, and finally said, "Even my life was given to me by the Eighth Route Army!"

    I asked him if he had settled accounts with Jin Shiyuan (the guy who cheated him when they ran the butcher shop together). He said, "What's there to settle? Jin Shiyuan ran away long ago, and his son joined the Eighth Route Army. His son came back for the New Year a few days ago, and when I mentioned it, he said that his father was a tyrant, and he wouldn't object if the house and land were confiscated. The Eighth Route Army is his home now. As soon as I heard that, I immediately withdrew my objections. He relies on the Eighth Route Army to live, and I rely on the Eighth Route Army to live, we are all one family, what is there to argue about? He is even more enlightened than me!"

    "All the foundations of rural tragedy have been eliminated!" I thought finally, completely affirming Jin Tongyuan's transformation.

　　从土匪到肉铺会计
    靳同元的过去和现在
    ·而东·
    如果不经靳同元本人证实，我简直不相信他曾经当过土匪。他现在在武安赵庄合作社肉铺当会计，放下算盘拿屠刀，放下屠刀拿火箸，里屋外屋，成天穿进穿出，忙得连过年时那么热闹的大戏都很少去瞧。显然他是一个很勤快，很精干的劳动者。说话时，眼睛躲闪着，露出善良与怯懦。他能忍受各种挖苦与讥讽，和任何人都处得来。人们因此都叫他老厚子。这样的人怎能当土匪呢？
    但是，当我和他本人谈话，和村干谈话，确知他过去赌钱、吸毒、当土匪都干过时，不禁又怀疑起来，他这转变能持久吗？于是我进一步去了解他的生平。
    “人都是没了一点奈何才干坏事的呀！”当我问到靳同元为什么当了土匪时，旁人和他自己都这样告诉我。他们举出本口以前被老财捕杀了的土匪李格鲁、李格训弟兄为例：“出款出不起，保长把他家过年蒸的团子都端走了。眼看要饿死，还有啥不敢干的？两眼漆黑，谁还能梦到有今天！反正活一天算一天，掉了脑袋活该啦！”
    靳同元自幼跟着父亲种那九亩薄地，本来是很勤劳、很能受的。农闲时担花椒、弄山货，跟着父亲闹肉房，杀猪宰羊，从早到晚屁股不挨炕。但是，劳动所得却大部分出了款。家里只好吃糠菜，穿破衣。他爹死了，穷得更狠。他和靳时元合开肉房。赚钱本来不多，还被靳时元独得五分之四（他的借口是他借来的本钱，但利钱却是柜上出）。挣不下钱，款出不上，九亩地也卖啦。“娘病，老婆哭，过得真心焦呀！”
    “旧社会兴的是‘帝国主义’，人家也算社首哩。咱敢惹人家？”靳同元回忆说：“肉房没法干，也没一点心思干啦。做别的又没本钱。没路走，就走开小路啦！起初是赌钱，后来就啥也干开啦！”
    “李格训搭我去抢的时候，娘已经病得很重，老婆想纺花没钱买，孩子饿得直叫。心想：不干也是死，干就干吧。一边往人家家走，一边心跳。将来落个啥下场呀！”
    “就干了这一回，也没干成。人家发觉了，打起来。两条缺枪不顶事，打了两枪就逃出来。村也不能在了，只好连夜跑。出去以后，心倒也安生了，反正干不成，以后也再不干了。咬咬牙，决意改邪归正，好歹要找个正事干。”
    这个可怜的人为逃避老财的捕杀，逃避毒品的包围与鬼的生活，曾经跑到武安城南同会村想当伪警备队。当他发现该据点十二个伪军全是料面鬼时，又借了六元盘缠跑到屯留。但屯留的毒品比武安还多，于是又跑到安泽给人家种地。
    一九四五年冬，他打听到故乡已完全变了样：恶霸老财打倒了，毒品没有了，穷人都有了地种，出款也很轻了，他高兴得要发狂，但又不敢回来。他托人来向村干部接洽，发誓改邪归正，言行不符时再撵出去；村干部又转向群众作了保证，他终于在去年三月回到久别的故乡。
    农会拨给他五亩好地、三间房，锅碗家具，一应俱全。他就和昔日的老婆孩子起早搭黑干起来了。六月，互助组选他当了组长，后来农会也选他当了组长；七月和九月的两次民兵参战，他都自动扛枪前去；秋后合作社闹肉房，群众又找到了他；冬季查田，割尾巴斗争，他是积极分子；最近分配土地房屋，又分给他五亩好地，换给他一座好屋，他被公选为评议员。无论谁，都说他现在“真变好了。”
    “起初你们怎敢保证他不再干坏事？”我问村干部。村干部们却看得似乎十分平淡。他们简单的说：“再干坏事？群众不行他！”
    “赚上钱他不会跑吗？”
    “往那儿跑？遍地都是八路军的办法！他那一套到那儿也兴不了啦！”
    “他不会跑到国民党那边吗？”
    “他不跑！他在这儿时光有多好！”
    阴历正月初九，我到靳同元家闲坐。他老婆穿着全新的棉衣，正和他丈母娘包饺子哩。馅子全是羊肉。十七岁的儿子长得漂亮而结实，正在收拾煤火。屋子亮而温暖。当我拒绝吃他们端给我的饺子时，靳同元说：“往年你来我家，张嘴要吃我也不给，我自己还没的吃哩！今年你来了，不吃就不行！”
    吃着饺子，他就扯起去年的生产来。夏秋两季，年景虽不算好，也收了三四石粮食，六、七十斤花。秋后闹肉房，他分得人股红利八万元（肉房以二十六万本钱赚了一百万）。而负担只出二十斤米。比起过去一亩地出两块现洋（合二斗米、六十斤），九亩地十八元，轻了二十七倍。老婆成年纺织，足供穿衣。他极口称赞老婆纺得快、织得好；老婆则极口称赞他“犁、耧、锄、耙，杀猪、宰羊、记账、打算样样都行！”连他那一直无表情的岳母和儿子也得偷偷一笑。
    靳同元说，秋后若再闹肉房，他就不打算分人股红利了。我问他真肯牺牲吗，他说：“八路军在前方连命都牺牲，咱这一点算啥？”这是赵庄群众为个人利益发生争执时，通常有效的排解话。靳同元说到这句话时，感慨的加了一句：“要没八路军，再有我一百个靳同元也叫狗吃啦！”他把家里上下左右桌椅缸柜都指了一遍，最后说：“连命也是八路军给我的！”
    我问他和靳时元（以前伙闹肉房时讹他的家伙）算账没有。他说：“那还算啥？靳时元早跑啦，他儿子当了八路军啦。他儿子前几天回来过年，我提了一句，人家说，他爹是恶霸，把房地没收了也没意见，八路军现在就是他家，我一听，马上收回意见。他靠八路军活，我也靠八路军活，都一家啦，还有啥争的？人家比咱还有认识！”
    “一切农村悲剧的基础都消灭了！”我最后想，完全肯定了靳同元的转变。
