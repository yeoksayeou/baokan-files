Visiting UN Relief Representative Mr. Harrison
    Xu Liyi

    This reporter interviewed Mr. Harrison, the UN Relief representative in charge of transporting relief supplies to the residents of the riverbed area, on the 20th of this month. The UN Relief office was originally stationed in Zhangqiu Town, but it had to be moved to the countryside due to repeated attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. When the reporter met Mr. Harrison, he had just returned from seeking shelter from an air raid in the countryside, covered in dust and still visibly shaken. When the reporter asked him why UN Relief had also become a target of Chiang Kai-shek's planes, he shook his head and said, "The Executive Yuan (of the Kuomintang government) asked us to come for relief, but the Kuomintang also sent planes to attack. We can't carry out our work, so we have to withdraw." Mr. Harrison and his team of four arrived in the Liberated Area on the 12th of this month from Kaifeng to deliver relief supplies. They experienced all kinds of difficulties passing through the KMT-controlled areas and finally arrived in Zhangqiu on the evening of the 14th. The Executive Yuan sent Cao Fulin's troops to escort them from Kaocheng to Caozhou, but upon arriving in Caozhou, it was discovered that the money box had been cut open with bayonets. After investigation, a total of 470,000 yuan was lost. On the 14th, when they arrived in Bangcheng, a Chiang Kai-shek plane was already tailing them for reconnaissance. On the morning of the 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's planes began bombing and strafing in shifts. Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been harassing them every day, resulting in the bombing and destruction of a relief supply truck on the 19th. Mr. Harrison spoke about the circumstances of the truck being bombed, saying: "The 'CHT' truck that was destroyed had a white cloth banner indicating that it was a UN Relief vehicle. Before we came to the Liberated Area, we had notified the Kuomintang military authorities, but it was still attacked." He emphasized: "It is very clear that we not only cannot carry out our work, but our lives are also in danger." Mr. Harrison personally inspected the areas along the old course of the Yellow River and witnessed the disaster and the destruction of the riverbed. He felt that the residents of Sunkou were the most severely affected. When his car stopped in Sunkou, many disaster victims immediately surrounded it, asking UN Relief to provide urgent assistance. He said, "I have taken photos of the tragic situation of the people affected by the disaster." He also told the reporter that after the ferry in Sunkou was bombed and sunk, many farmers with pale faces, who were unable to cross the river due to the blockade, shouted and cursed: "Chiang Kai-shek is a coward!" As he spoke, the roar of airplanes sounded in the sky again. Mr. Harrison ran to the countryside to take shelter. He told the reporter, "You see, how can we carry out our work?"

    许力以
    记者于本月二十日访问运送河床居民救济物资的联总代表韩森先生。联总办事处原驻张秋镇、但因蒋机连日轮番袭击，已赶移乡村。记者见韩森先生时，他刚从野外躲避空袭回来，满身灰尘惊骇之色未去。当记者问他为何联总也成为蒋机袭击之目标时，他摇摇头说：“行总一面叫我们来救济，但国民党又一面派飞机来袭击，我们无法进行工作，只得撤回去了。”联总一行四人，于本月十二日由开封送救济物资来解放区，中经蒋区，百般阻难，辗转至十四日晚始抵张秋。由考城到曹州行总曾派有曹福林部队押送，但抵曹州时发现钞票箱被剌刀割破，清查结果，共损失四十七万元。十四日抵邦城时，即有蒋机一架尾追侦察。十五日晨抵张秋后蒋机即轮番轰炸扫射。连日来蒋机无日不来骚扰，致十九日救济物资汽车一辆被炸焚毁。韩森先生谈及该汽车被炸经过情形称：“被炸毁的‘ＣＨＴ’汽车，挂有白布标帜表示为联总车辆。我们来解放区之前，曾通知国方军事当局，然而竟遭袭击。”他着重地说：“这是很明显的，我们不但不能进行工作，而且生命也很危险。”韩森先生曾亲赴故道沿岸视察，目睹灾情与此次河床破坏情形他感觉孙口居民受灾最严重。当他汽车停在孙口时，许多灾民即围住要求联总急予救济。他说：“老百姓受灾惨状，我都摄有照片的。”他又告诉记者，在孙口渡船被炸沉后，许多面色惨淡的农民，因被阻隔不能过河而喊骂：“老蒋孬种！”谈到这里，忽然轰轰的飞机声又在上空响起，韩森先生奔跑到野外躲避，他告诉记者说：“你看我们怎能进行工作呢？”
