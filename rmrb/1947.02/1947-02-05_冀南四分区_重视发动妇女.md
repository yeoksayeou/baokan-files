Southern Hebei Fourth District
	Emphasizes Mobilizing Women

[Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 2nd] The Julu, Pingxiang, Wei and other counties in the Fourth District of Southern Hebei, pay attention to mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the liquidation of landlords during the rent reduction movement. They have been freed from their basic suffering - feudal economic and political oppression. The Julu County Party Committee resoundingly proposed: "If the women in an area are not thoroughly mobilized or have not been mobilized to stand up, it can only be considered that a part of the task has been completed." With the efforts of the cadres, most of the women in each village in the county participated in the movement. In Da Xiao Pan Village, under the slogan "Everyone, men and women, has a share in standing up," members of the peasant association personally mobilized the women in their families to join the association. Many families were united in their hearts, and everyone was a member of the association. In Hou Lanjiaying, except for the women in the families of seven landlords and rich peasants, all the remaining women were organized. Cadres in Pingxiang County districts and villages broke the idea that male comrades were not suitable for women's work, and working women have been active on the battle line of struggle. Wang Er's wife, a cadre of Dongjiazhuang Village in the Third District, actively liaised day and night, and 96 women joined the women's association in five days. In Zou Village, Fifth District, the women's association added more than 100 new members in one day, and in Sanxia Village, Second District, 90 percent of the women had already joined the organization. In Pan Gu Village, Wei County, the women's association used to have only 30 to 40 old women. Because the cadres went deep into the women's households, used "life is not easy" to enlighten the women to find the root of poverty, and proposed to stand up like men, they then connected one by one. All 190 women in the village joined the association. After the women in Sanxia Village, Second District, Pingxiang, were organized, they deeply discussed the exploitation of the poor by the landlords, and gradually realized that they ate chaff and wild vegetables and suffered poverty with their men, and they should not hate the men or their own bad fate, but hate the landlords who exploited their families with usury and heavy rent. They said that they must settle accounts with the landlords. After class education, a large number of women activists emerged. When Julu Zhao Village struggled against the landlord Song Dechang, the woman Li Xiumei led everyone to pour out their grievances and transport the fruits of the struggle from east to west for two days without rest, and said that the landlords occupied the land and houses in famine years and oppressed the poor, and these things were ours. Du Yueqin, a women's leader in Xixiading, rushed to do work at night and actively brewed and organized and led the struggle during the day. The women's peasant association of Sanjie Village, Wei County, carried out the struggle together. At the meeting, the women spoke boldly, greatly improving the status of women. The Julu Zhang Qiying Women's Association separately struggled against the wife of the landlord Zhang Laomao, the "female tiger" Cao Luan. The women who poured out their grievances at the meeting were very enthusiastic.

　　冀南四分区
    重视发动妇女
    【本报威县二日电】冀南四分区巨鹿、平乡、威县等县，在查减运动中，注意发动广大妇女，参加对地主的清算。她们解脱了基本痛苦——封建经济及政治压迫。巨鹿县委响亮提出：“如那区妇女发动的不彻底或未发动翻身，只算完成了一部。”在干部努力下，全县各村大部妇女参加运动。大小潘庄在“翻身男女都有份”的口号下，农会员都亲自动员自家女人入会，很多户全家心齐，人人在会。后兰家营除七家地主富农家中妇女外，其余全部妇女组织起来。平乡县区村干部打破男同志不适合作妇女工作等思想，劳动妇女已活跃在斗争的战线上。三区董家庄村干王二媳妇，不分白天黑夜积极串连，五天中有九十六名妇女参加妇会。五区邹庄妇会一天中添了新会员百余名，二区三夏庄百分之九十的妇女已参加组织。威县潘固妇会，过去只有老妇女三四十人，由于干部深入花户，用“过日子不容易”，启发妇女找穷根，提出和男人一样闹翻身，从此一个一个串连。该村一百九十名妇女全入了会。平乡二区三夏庄妇女组织起来后，深刻讨论了地主对穷人的剥削，渐渐觉悟了自己吃糠咽菜跟着男人受穷，不能恨男人或恨自己的命运不好，要恨用高利贷重租把自家剥削穷的地主，她们表示一定要和地主清算。经过阶级教育涌现出大批妇女积极分子。巨鹿赵庄斗争地主宋德常时，妇女李秀梅领导大家诉苦，搬运果实，从东头到西头，两天不休息，并说地主们灾荒年霸占了土地房屋，坑压穷人，这些东西都是咱的。西下町妇女领袖杜月琴夜里赶出活来，白天积极进行酝酿，组织领导斗争。威县三洁村妇女农会共同进行了斗争，会上妇女大胆发言，大大提高了妇女地位。巨鹿张起营妇会单独斗争了地主张老茂之妻、母老虎曹銮，会上诉苦妇女非常踊跃。
