    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th. Moscow Radio broadcasted on the 5th, commentator Masinu, commenting on current affairs in China, said: The so-called "government reorganization" being carried out by the Kuomintang is an attempt by the Kuomintang reactionaries to carry out their one-party dictatorship and anti-communist policies under this guise. This is not only deceiving public opinion, but also expanding the anti-democratic civil war. Chinese democrats pointed out that Senator Vandenberg's recent speech on supporting the Kuomintang's anti-communist policy towards China is a declaration of the United States' agenda, which is bound to become the basis of Marshall's activities. This agenda is consistent with the "government reorganization" trick played by the Kuomintang. Wenhui Daily said: The US policy towards China has not changed, and the "government reorganization" carried out by the Kuomintang is used to deceive the foreign ministers' conference to be held in Moscow and to deceive the people of China and the United States. Some American commentators have also come to the same conclusion. For example, far East affairs commentator, Mr. Slater, said: The United States government is stepping up its propaganda in order to convince Americans that China's new "government" is a "democratic" government and the newly passed "constitution" is a "democratic" constitution, so that the United States can step up its military assistance to the Kuomintang.

    中外舆论一致指出：
    蒋介石“改组政府”
    是扩大反民主内战
    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科五日广播，评论员马西努论中国时事称：国民党正在进行的所谓“政府改组”是国民党反动派企图在这种掩盖之下，执行其一党独裁与反共的政策，这不仅是欺骗社会舆论，而且是扩大反民主的内战。中国民主人士指出：最近美国参议员范登堡关于支持国民党排斥共产党的对华政策演说，是宣布美国的纲领，它势蒋成为马歇尔活动的基础。这一纲领与国民党所玩的“改组政府”把戏是一致的原则。文汇报说：美对华政策没有改变，国民党所进行的“改组政府”是用来欺骗将在莫斯科举行的外长会议，并欺骗中美人民。美国某些评论员也得出了同样的结论，如远东问题评论员史列特说：美国政府在加紧进行宣传，其目的在使美国人相信中国新的“政府”是“民主”政府，新通过的“宪法”是“民主”宪法，这样美国好加紧对国民党的军事援助。
