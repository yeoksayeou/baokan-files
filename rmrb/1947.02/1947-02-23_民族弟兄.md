　　National Brothers
    By V. Vasilevska, translated by Yi Zhenjie

    To the frontline commanders and fighters, who have long expressed their love for Soviet war novels. Today, on Red Army Day, we have specially selected this piece as a commemoration and to share with our readers.
          ——Editor

    ——Hey, national brothers, time to eat!
    ——Coming!——Resakov replied. The three of them walked into the smoke-filled field kitchen together.

    Whenever the tank captain asked, "Where are the national brothers?" every Red Army soldier could accurately point to a gigantic gray tank.

    There were three of them in total – a Ukrainian, a Russian, and a Jew, all tank drivers. Not only did they have to be together in the tank, but they were inseparable everywhere else. They slept together, ate together, and had long conversations together.

    ——You're always talking, what do you talk about? Doesn't it get boring?
    Fenchelishtein smiled shyly.
    ——Boring? There are so many questions… We talk about our own things, it doesn't bother anyone else.

    To be honest, the one who loved to talk the most was Fenchelishtein. Mikola always liked to laugh and listen. Resakov, on the other hand, was often silent and worried.

    ——What do you think? … Take life, for example, I tell you, I really like life… and I hope to live as well as possible… What a great country we have? We know ourselves what a good people we are!... Everything there is getting better year by year, even month by month…

    This is very clear,——Fenchelishtein began his lengthy discussion.——With capitalism, there is war. With capitalist encirclement, we have the threat of war.

    Resakov listened, nodded, and sighed deeply.
    ——I know, I know everything, you don't need to lecture me.——But you have to know that understanding this is only one side of the issue, and the other side!——That's difficult, what do you think?
    ——It's all because we're occupying our positions and not doing things.——Mikola interjected in a man's bass.
    ——What else can we do...?——When bullets are whistling over our heads, there's no time to think.
    ——As for me——Fenchelishtein confessed——I happen to want to think at that time…!
    ——What do you think about?
    ——Not think about what, but think about who... I often think about her, her name is Shaniang.
    ——Your girl?
    ——Yes, I often think about Shaniang.
    ——What kind of person is she?——Mikola asked with great interest.
    ——Her? Shaniang… Shaniang, is a short person, at most only up to my shoulder height… She has black hair, black eyes. Ah, so black… When she smiles, she has dimples on her cheeks…
    ——Yes, Mikola said affirmatively with expression——Round little dimples…
    ——How do you know her——Fenchelishtein asked uneasily.
    ——I wasn't talking about Shaniang, I was talking about Shasha…
    ——Aha…
    ——Resakov sighed.
    ——I already have two children: a girl and a boy. Both are clever and cute children.
    ——How old is the oldest?——Mikola asked with great interest.
    ——Six or seven years old, is a boy, very naughty, how does his mother deal with him at home?... The girl... is a very clever and cute girl! When she sings, her voice is as clear and beautiful as a nightingale, she will become an actress in the future... What about your Shaniang?...

    Shaniang is in the factory, she works in a clothing factory. My father is also in the factory, in the textile factory. My mother has passed away, she died very early, and now I can't even remember her. I am the youngest…

    ——Do you have siblings?
    ——Of course… My sister is a doctor, my brother is in the Far East Red Army… There are three of us in total… Originally four brothers, one middle brother died.
    ——Aha,... Fenchelishtein, please tell me, what do you think the situation will be like after the war?
    ——After the war? It depends on many things… the German working class…
    They listened intently to his account.
    ——You are very knowledgeable, Fenchelishtein... Where did you study, in the library... You must have been a university professor or something... Don't be in a tank...
    Fenchelishtein smiled shyly.
    ——I also wanted to be a university professor... My father often said at home: "Shimuli, you have such a good brain!"
    ——You want to be a university professor... This can only happen after the war...
    ——Of course, after the war.
    ——You still need to study, study hard...
    ——After the war, on the first day after the war, I will immediately marry Shasha, and we will run the collective farm well. We will have children, many, many children, and I will take care of farm work.
    ——After the war, I want to go to the Caucasus with Linna, she has never been to the Caucasus, I promised her long ago, but I have never been able to do it. But we must go after the war.
    ——Listen to me——Fenchelishtein said spiritedly——Let's meet again after the war! Me and Shaniang, Mikola and Shasha, you and your wife, all come to our Kharkov.
    ——I think, it's best to go to my house. Why go to the city? Come back, you can lie on the grass in the orchard. Our orchard, aha! I tell you, there are so many apples, if you bring the children there, they will be very happy. Your children can also climb the tree to pick apples.
    …………………
    ——Can you make pancakes?——Resakov asked.
    ——Why not? We can also make some pancakes... But it's best to let Shasha make pancakes for us, using cheese batter, when you eat them, you always want to eat, always want to eat, until your stomach is bloated, but it is impossible to spit them out, our pancakes are like that.
    ——I don't really care about eating... Lying on the grass. Walking by the river, that's fine——Fenchelishtein agreed——Shaniang really likes scenery…
    ——Comrades, let's consider this an agreement!
    ——Consider it an agreement.
    ——I hope we can drive away the Germans!
    ——Don't be afraid, we will drive them away...
    ——I know… but I hope it's faster…
    ——It depends on how fast!
    ——The First World Imperialist War continued… Fenchelishtein began lecturing again.
    Resakov waved his hand.
    ——What First World Imperialist War! There were no tanks or airplanes at that time, generally speaking, technology… Now it's different, things will develop faster.
    ——It may be faster——Fenchelishtein agreed.
    ——I hope we go straight ahead——Mikola sighed.
    ——We must go straight ahead——Fenchelishtein comforted him——But strategy requires…
    ——Hey, national brothers, get ready!
    They immediately ran into their own "house." The gigantic tank rumbled forward with deafening sounds.
    High in the sky, the sound of airplane engines echoed. The faint sound of artillery in the distance, like the suppressed roar of a huge beast in the deep night, vibrated the air. Far away on the horizon, the bright fire of exploding shells ignited, like the reflection of a burning field. The tank advanced along the road in the darkness of the night. In the distance, the grinding sound of tank tracks rang around, the heavy scraping sound of steel. On the road, pine branches hung low, startled birds flew up in the darkness, flapping their wings helplessly in the darkness of the forest, the tank column, like a long steel snake, moved forward with a rumbling roar, the tanks – these speechless, blind monsters, advanced one after another.

    The battle began in the morning. The heavy tanks moved forward with the huge metallic grinding sound, pushing down small trees, breaking off tree trunks, the small birch forest, like oats under the sharp blade of a sickle, obediently fell down, dewdrops on the leaves, like raindrops, fell on the steel plates of the leading tanks. The thin branches on the white birch trunks, like a beautiful green on the milky white congealed matter, as if the tanks, which were about to crush everything in their path, were heading towards the milky white smoke, towards the swaying green vastness of the birch trees, towards the fern thickets covering the ground like feathered palmate leaves. In an instant, shells flew over, exploding with fierce light with moaning and whistling sounds. The artillery roared, the machine guns fired @@@@.

    Resakov constantly held his machine gun in his hand, accurately spreading death among the German troops who were approaching with barbaric and unpleasant cries. Due to continuous firing, the entire body of the tank was vibrating, roaring, the steel plate was already very hot, the weather was stuffy and hot, and full of the smell of gunpowder, the tank slowly crawled on the hill, the entire weight of the vehicle was pressing on the rear, the tracks were rolling on the dry ground, in the blink of an eye, the birch tree was crushed, the broken branches crackled, and suddenly a vast open space appeared in front of the tank.

    Creak... Resakov felt that, in addition to the sound of the birch trees being broken, there were also human bones, human skulls, human bodies, being crushed under the tracks like "oil worms," Resakov thought with disgust.

    At this moment, something rang, the steel monster trembled, beeped a few times, moved forward slightly again, and stopped moving.

    ——Track!——Mikola shouted in a beastly voice.

    Resakov nodded, and the two of them sat in front of another machine gun. The immobile tank, like a hazy hill, lay amidst the birch trees lying in a mess, amidst the green branches that had not been touched by the golden hand of autumn.

    ——Woooooo…

    Resakov immediately heard this sound, and felt as if he was humming it himself. The Germans were firing directly at them. He saw their blood-red faces, their wide-open shouting mouths, they were drunk as usual, drunk, and in their drunken daze they were heading towards unavoidable death. He looked back and saw Mikola and Fenchelishtein covering their eyes with their hands, their machine guns were no longer firing. Blood flowed out from Fenchelishtein's fingers like a stream.

    ——Eyes, eyes, eyes!——Mikola repeated monotonously.

    A chill ran down Resakov's spine. He went to the injured, just at this moment, the German fire became tighter. He quickly pounced on his machine gun. Seeing them walking forward, rushing forward recklessly.

    ——Bullets! Can you pass me the bullets?

    So Fenchelishtein groped and crawled to his side, and Mikola touched the bullets with trembling hands.

    ——Bring it, bring it. Can you pass me the bullets?
    ——Wait a minute, I will soon, soon………

    He didn't look back at their blood-soaked faces, but he could clearly hear their difficult breathing and the sound of mechanically passing bullets behind him. He only aimed at the clearly visible targets, aiming at the Germans who were appearing from behind the small hill and would shoot.

    ——Bring it, bring it, bring the bullets! (To be continued)

　　民族弟兄
    Ｖ·华西列夫斯卡著  伊真节译
    前线指战员们，早就表示爱看苏联的战斗小说。今天红军节，我们特选载这一篇以为纪念，并与读者。
          ——编者
    ——喂，民族弟兄们，吃饭吧！
    ——就来！——雷萨科夫答道。三个人一块走进烟气薰薰的野战厨房。
    什么时候当坦克队长问：“民族弟兄在什么地方”？每一个红军战士都能准确地指给一辆巨型的灰色坦克。
    他们一共三个人——乌克兰人、俄罗斯人、犹太人，都是坦克驾驶员。他们三个人，不仅在坦克上要在一块儿，而且无论在什么地方都是形影不离的。他们一块儿睡觉、一块儿吃饭、一块儿进行长时间的谈话。
    ——你总是谈天，谈什么呢？也不觉得厌烦吗？
    芬切里什丁含羞地笑了笑。
    ——厌烦什么？有这么许许多多的问题……我们谈我们自己的，又不妨碍别人。
    说老实话，最爱谈天的还是芬切里什丁。米考拉总喜欢笑，喜欢听。雷萨科夫则常常是沉默忧虑的。
    ——你以为怎样？……就说生活吧，我告诉你，我是非常喜欢生活的………而且希望尽可能生活得好一些……。我们的国家，啊，是一个怎样好的国家啊？我们的人民——我们自己知道，是一个怎样好的人民啊？……那里的一切，一年比一年好，一年比一年，简直是一月比一月好………。
    这是十分明白的，——芬切里什丁开始了他冗长的议论。——有资本主义，就有战争。有资本主义包围，我们就有战争的威胁。
    雷萨科夫听着，点着头，长叹了一口气。
    ——我晓得，我什么都知道，用不着给我上课。——可是要知道，明白这只是问题的一方面，而另一方面！——那就困难了，你以为怎样？
    ——这全是因为我们占着位子不做事情。——米考拉用着男子的低音插上了一句。
    ——不然又该怎样呢………——当子弹在我们头上啸叫的时候，连思索的时间也没有了。
    ——我呢——芬切里什丁自白道——我恰巧在那时候要想…！
    ——你想什么？
    ——不是想什么，而是想谁……我常常想，她叫沙娘。
    ——你的姑娘吗？
    ——是的，我就是常常想沙娘。
    ——他是一个什么样的人？——米考拉很感兴趣的问道。
    ——她吗？沙娘……沙娘，是一个身裁短小的，顶多只达我的肩膀高……她有着黑色的头发，黑色的眼睛。啊哈，是那样的黑哟……一笑的时候，两颊上的酒窝……
    ——是的，米考拉有声有色的肯定的说——圆圆的小酒窝……
    ——你怎么知道她——芬切里什丁不安的问。
    ——我不是说沙娘，我是说夏沙……
    ——啊哈……
    ——雷萨科夫叹了一口气。
    ——我已经有两个小孩：一个女孩，一个男孩。都是聪明伶俐的小孩子。
    ——大的几岁？——米考拉颇感兴趣的问道。
    ——六、七岁，是个男孩子，非常调皮，母亲在家里怎样对付他呢？……女孩子，………是一个非常聪明伶俐的女孩子！唱歌的时候，声音黄莺一样清脆好听，将来要做个女演员………你的沙娘呢？……
    沙娘在工厂里，她在被服厂工作。我的父亲也在工厂里，在纺织工厂。我的母亲已经去世了，她死得很早，现在甚至已记不起她了。我是一个最小的……
    ——你有兄弟姐妹吗？
    ——怎么没有……我的姐姐是医生，我的哥哥在远东红军里………我们一共三个……原来是四个弟兄，中间一个哥哥死了。
    ——啊哈，……芬切里什丁，请你告诉我，你以为战后情形怎样？
    ——战后吗？这要看许多……德国的工人阶级……
    他们紧张地听着他的讲述。
    ——你是很有学识的，芬切里什丁……你在什么地方学习的，在图书馆……你做过大学教授或什么吧……不要在坦克上…
    芬切里什丁羞涩地笑了笑。
    ——我也很想做个大学教授……父亲在家时常常说：“什木里，你有一个多好的头脑啊！”
    ——你要做大学教授………这只有战后……
    ——当然要在战后。
    ——你还需要学习，好好的学习……
    ——战后，在战后第一天，我要立刻同夏沙结婚，我们要把集体农场办好。我们要生孩子，生很多很多的孩子，我要料理农事。
    ——战后，我要同林纳到高加索去，她从来没有到高加索，我早就答应她了，但始终没有做到。可是战后一定要去。
    ——你们听着，——芬切里什丁生气勃勃的说——战后我们还是重逢吧！我和沙娘，米考拉和夏沙，你和你的妻子，都到我们霍尔科夫去。
    ——我以为，最好都到我家里去。干吗到城市里去呢？你回来吧，你们可以躺在果木园的草地上。我们的果木园，啊哈！我告诉你们，有那么多的苹果，要是你把小孩子们也带到那里去，他们一定非常高兴。你的小孩还可以爬到树上去摘苹果呢。
    …………………
    ——你们会做煎饼吗？——雷萨科夫问。
    ——怎么不会？我们也可以做一些煎饼………不过最好让夏沙给我们做煎饼，用乳酪的发面的煎饼，吃的时候，你总想吃，总想吃，吃得肚子都发胀了，可是要吐出来，那是不可能的，我们的煎饼就是这样的。
    ——我对于吃东西倒不太在乎…………在草地上躺着。在河边散步，这倒可以——芬切里什丁同意着——沙娘非常喜欢风景…………
    ——同志们，这就算是预约了吧！
    ——算做预约了吧。
    ——希望把德国人打走就好了！
    ——不要害怕，我们要把他们打走的……
    ——我知道…………不过希望快一些……
    ——要看怎样的快法！
    ——第一次世界帝国主义大战继续了…………芬切里什丁又开始讲课了。
    雷萨科夫把手一挥。
    ——什么第一次帝国主义大战！那时候还没有坦克飞机，一般说来技术…………现在不同了，事情要发展得更快一些。
    ——可能更快一些，——芬切里什丁同意道。
    ——希望一往直前就好了——米考拉叹了一口气。
    ——就是要一往直前，——芬切里什丁安慰他说——但是战略需要……
    ——喂，民族弟兄们准备好！
    他们立刻跑进自己的“小屋”。巨型的坦克响着震耳的轰轰隆隆的声音向前开动了。
    在高高的上空，响着飞机的马达声。远处隐约的炮声，好像深夜里巨大野兽被压抑住的吼声，震荡着空气。远远的在地平线上，燃起了雪亮的炮弹爆炸的火光，如同火烧场的反光。坦克在夜的黑暗中沿着大路前进着。远处，周围响起了坦克轮带的轧轧声，钢铁笨重的磨擦声。大路上，松枝低低的下垂着，受惊的鸟儿在黑暗里飞起来，在森林的黑暗中，无可奈何地鼓动着翅膀，坦克纵队，像钢铁的长蛇一样发着轧轧的巨响向前驶去，坦克——这不会说话的盲目的怪物，一个跟着一个前进了。
    战斗在早晨开始了。沉重的坦克响着巨大的金属磨擦的声音前进着，推倒了小树，压断了树杆，小小的白桦林，如同燕麦在利刃的镰刀下服从地倒了下去，树叶上的露珠、雨点般的落在前几辆坦克的钢板上。细小的树枝在白色的白桦树杆上，像在乳白色的凝结物上一样发着优美的绿色，好像是要把前进道路上的一切都要压得粉碎的坦克，正向着那乳白色的烟雾，向着那摇曳不定的白桦树的绿色苍茫，向着那羽毛似的掌状叶铺扫大地的羊齿丛驶去。顷刻之间，炮弹飞了过来，带着呻吟呼啸的声音放射着张烈的光芒爆炸了。大炮在轰轰隆隆的响着，机关枪在＠＠＠＠的放射着。
    雷萨科夫不停的用手握着自己的机关枪，准确地向那些发着野蛮难听的叫喊走向前来的德国部队散布死亡。由于不断的射击，坦克的整个机体在震动着，轰鸣着，钢板已发高热，天气又闷又热，而且充满着火药味，坦克在小丘上慢慢的爬行着，车的全部重量都压在后面，轮带在干燥的土地上滚动着，转眼间，白桦树被辗碎了，压断了的树枝，发着暴裂的声音，刹时在坦克前面现出一片广阔的空地。
    咯吱吱……雷萨科夫觉得，除去白桦树被压断的声音，还有人的骨头，人的头颅，人的躯体，像“油虫”一样在轮带下被压碎了，雷萨科夫带着嫌恶的心情想着。
    正在这时，什么东西响了一声，钢铁的怪物颤动了一下，嘟嘟了几声，又向前稍微移动了一下，便停止不动了。
    ——轮带！——米考拉用着野兽般的声音叫着。
    雷萨科夫点了点头，他们两人便坐到另一挺机枪前面去。不能移动的坦克，像朦胧的小山一样，在横七竖八倒卧着的白桦树中间，在那未经秋天的黄金手触动过绿色枝条中间仰卧着。
    ——呜呜………
    雷萨科夫立刻听到了这个声音，而且觉得，仿佛自己在哼似的。德国人向他们直接地开火了。他看见他们血红的脸，张得大大的叫喊着的嘴巴，他们照例又喝醉了酒，喝醉了，他们就在醉意朦胧中走向难以避免的死亡。他回头看了一下，看见身后米考拉和芬切里什丁用手蒙着眼睛，他们的机枪已不再响了。血像小溪一样从芬切里什丁的手缝里往外流。
    ——眼睛，眼睛，眼睛！——米考拉单调的反复叫喊。
    雷萨科夫身上打了一个寒战。他走到受伤者们面前，恰在这时，德军的枪更加紧密了。他连忙扑到自己的机枪旁。看见他们正在向前走，在不顾一切的向前冲。
    ——子弹！你们能不能把子弹递给我？
    于是芬切里什丁摸索着爬到他身边，米考拉用发抖的手去摸子弹。
    ——拿来，拿来。你们能不能递给我子弹？
    ——等一等，我马上，马上………
    他并没回头去看他们那鲜血淋淋的脸，可是他们在他背后艰难的呼吸和机械地传递子弹的声音，他都能清楚地听到。他只顾瞄准那清楚可见的目标，瞄准那从小土丘后面出现的德国人会开枪射击。
    ——拿来，拿来，拿子弹来！（未完待续）
