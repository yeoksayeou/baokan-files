[Report from our newspaper in Weixian on the 6th] After Yuan Dynasty completed land reform, various villages combined war service with production. In Yinjia Village, Wang Fengchao's group made specific divisions of labor, some going on business trips, some pressing oil, clarifying responsibilities. This not only completed war tasks but also combined with production, earning a profit of 33,000 yuan in one month from oil pressing. After the emancipation movement, Tishang Village in the Sixth District, under the leadership of the militia instructor and the farmers' association director, established groups for milling flour, ginning cotton, and pressing oil. These two groups have already gained a gross profit of 300,000 yuan. In Puxian Village in the Fifth District, the entire village voluntarily helped each other in preparation for war, preparing for war on one hand and engaging in sideline production on the other. Thirty militiamen took the lead in various groups, and in one month, twenty-three groups earned a total of more than 130,000 yuan. After investigation and rent reduction, Zhang Village organized four mutual aid groups, three timber groups, and one fruit selling group, earning 168,000 yuan in half a month. The masses of the entire village have realized that participating in mutual aid groups can increase production and ensure that spring plowing will not be difficult.

[Report from our newspaper in Weixian on the 6th] Han Dahei, a labor hero from Hanzhuang in Hengshui, leads the entire village in production. A young landlord who was struggled against, at his persuasion, picked up firewood every day, often passing by Dahei's door, deliberately letting people see him. Dahei often said to his wife, "The Communist Party and the democratic government have liberated us. We would be letting Chairman Mao down if we didn't work actively." Now he has repaired plows, harrows, ropes, carts, etc., and is actively preparing for spring plowing. Under Dahei's leadership, after the sixth day of the new year, the mutual aid groups are actively preparing mud and manure soil, and also preparing fodder for the livestock, saving manpower and animal power to prepare for large-scale production. Women are busy washing clothes and making shoes. On the fifteenth day of the new year, the village will hold a mutual aid group meeting to plan that the mutual aid groups will start working immediately after the ground thaws.
