    Jinnan Emancipated Peasants
    Actively Build Homes and Study Independently
    [Report from our newspaper in Jinnan, 10th] The emancipated peasants of Jinnan are actively building homes and studying independently. Sun Heguai Village in En County is located in the old liberated area, with poor land and impoverished people. Before the War of Resistance, most people, except for a few landlords, made a living selling candied haws and braiding hemp ropes. In famine years, one-third of the village's population fled to the Northeast, and 106 people have still not returned home. After the emancipation movement, the mass leader Sun Yichao called for the establishment of a cooperative. Ninety-seven percent of the village's population raised one million yuan and opened two oil presses and a lumber shop (also burning charcoal). All men and women, young and old, in the village are actively engaged in production. Two loafers, after being reformed by the village peasants' association, have also begun to collect firewood and manure. The village has never had a school. In order to teach their children to read, the peasants established a primary school, and all the children are attending school. Every evening, the children's corps, women's group, militia, and cooperative members compete in singing. Fan Lao'e of Zonggege Village in the Fourth District was unable to make a living due to poverty since childhood and worked as a long-term laborer for others all his life. He has been a widower for more than fifty years. In this mass movement, he obtained land and recently married a wife, establishing a family. He is overjoyed and often says, "I will never forget Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, who would care if I starved to death?"

    冀南翻身农民
    积极建家自学
    【本报冀南十日电】冀南翻身农民积极建家自学。恩县孙贺拐村地处老区，地瘠民贫，抗战前除几户地主外，多数卖糖葫芦和做八股绳为生。灾荒年全村三分之一的人口逃荒关外，至今还有一百零六口未回家。经过翻身运动后，群众领袖孙义朝号召成立合作社，全村百分之九十七的人口集资百万元，开了两个油坊，一个木料店（兼烧木炭），全村男女老少都在积极的生产，两个二流子经村农会的改造，亦开始拾柴拾粪。这村历来没有过学校，农民为叫孩子们识字，便成立了一处小学，全体儿童都上了学，每晚儿童团、姐妹团、民兵、合作社的伙友都比赛唱歌。四区冢圪塔村范老峨，自幼家贫无法生活，给人家作了一辈子长工，鳏居五十多年，这次群运中，获得土地，最近又娶了媳妇，建立了家务，他喜上加喜，常常说：“我啥时也忘不了毛主席共产党，要不是毛主席饿死我谁管”。
