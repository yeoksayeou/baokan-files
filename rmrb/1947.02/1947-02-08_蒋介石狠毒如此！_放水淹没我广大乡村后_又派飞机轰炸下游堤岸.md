    Jiang Jieshi is so vicious!
    After flooding our vast countryside,
    he sent planes to bomb the downstream dikes
    [Our newspaper's front-line report from the Ji-Lu-Yu area, 6th] For days, Jiang Jieshi has been sending planes to bomb the Yellow River dikes in the Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area downstream, attempting to breach the dikes and flood vast areas inhabited by our people in the Ji-Lu-Yu region. Jiang Jieshi is playing a double game. While engaging in negotiations, he also closed the gap and released the water. On January 12th, the Yellow River water entered the Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area between Changyuan and Dongming. On the 13th, it flowed to Batou in Puyang; on the 14th, it passed Yecheng and Linpuji; on the 15th, it flowed to Xiaoyanglou; on the 16th, it flowed to Liqiao in Puyang; on the 17th, it flowed through Fanxian into Shouzhang; and on the 19th, it flowed to Zhangqiu, and on the 25th to Dong'a County. Wherever the Yellow River water reached, it became a vast expanse of water. Tens of thousands of mu of wheat fields in several counties along the river were flooded; the losses of houses, livestock, and firewood are incalculable. The people along the river have suffered an unprecedented disaster, but Jiang Jieshi still thinks it is not enough. Recently, he has been sending one or two or three planes every day to scout along the river, bombing our people along the river who are repairing the dangerous sections. Regardless of humans or animals, as soon as a target is spotted, Jiang's American-made planes indiscriminately strafe them; this inhumane atrocity clearly aims to put the people along the river in the Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area to death. All the people in Ji-Lu-Yu are filled with righteous indignation at this act of Jiang, and they have lodged complaints with our democratic government and appealed to the people of the whole country and the world to quickly stop this inhumane crime of the Jiang Jieshi government.
    [Our newspaper's report from Ji-Lu-Yu, 6th] At 10:00 AM on the 1st of this month, an American-made Jiang plane flew in from the southeast, flew to Sunkou ferry in the first district of Shouzhang, and suddenly flew low to wantonly strafe our dike repairing workers, destroying four large carts and injuring three of our dike repairing workers. The masses were filled with righteous indignation at this atrocity of Jiang Jieshi. Everyone said angrily: "Jiang Jieshi is a coward. On one hand, he releases water, and on the other hand, he uses planes to strafe our dike repairing workers, hindering our dike repair and trying to drown the residents along the river in our liberated area with the Yellow River water. We cannot watch ourselves being drowned by the Yellow River water. We must organize and fight him to the death."

    蒋介石狠毒如此！
    放水淹没我广大乡村后
    又派飞机轰炸下游堤岸
    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】蒋介石连日派飞机轰炸黄河下游冀鲁豫解放区黄河堤岸，企图使河水决堤，淹没我冀鲁豫区广大地区人民。蒋介石玩弄两面手法，一面谈判，一面合龙放水后，一月十二日黄水即进入冀鲁豫解放区之长垣与东明之间。十三日流至濮阳坝头，十四日过邺城临濮集，十五日流至小杨楼，十六日流至濮县李桥，十七日由范县境流至寿张，十九日流至张秋，二十五日流至东阿县。黄水所至，一片汪洋。沿河数县被淹没之麦田约数万亩；房屋、牲畜、柴草的损失，更不可计数。沿河人民遭此空前浩劫，蒋介石犹以为未足，近复每日派飞机一架到两三架，沿河侦察，炸我正在进行抢修险工的沿河人民。不分人畜，一发现目标，蒋记美式飞机即滥肆扫射；这种惨无人道的暴行，显系欲置我冀鲁豫解放区沿河人民于死地而后已。我全冀鲁豫人民对蒋贼此举，义愤填膺，纷纷向我民主政府提出控诉，向全国及全世界人民呼吁，迅速制止蒋介石政府这种惨无人道的罪行。
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】本月一日上午十时，美制蒋机一架从东南方向飞来，飞至寿张一区孙口渡口，突然低飞向我修堤坝员工肆意扫射，击毁大车四辆，击伤我修坝员工三人，群众对蒋介石此种暴行，无不义愤填膺，大家愤慨地说：“蒋介石个孬种，一面放水，一面用飞机扫射我们修坝工人，阻碍我们修坝，想用黄水淹死咱们解放区沿河居民。我们不能看着被黄水淹死，我们要组织起来誓死跟他拚。”
