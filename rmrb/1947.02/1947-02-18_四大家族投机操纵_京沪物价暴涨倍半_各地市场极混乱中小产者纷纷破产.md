Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 15th: A comprehensive report from various sources indicates that the wave of skyrocketing and plummeting gold and U.S. dollar prices, triggered by speculation and manipulation by the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, has swept through major cities in the KMT-controlled areas, plunging the entire market into extreme chaos. Many small and medium property owners have gone bankrupt one after another within days.

This crisis began at the start of the Gregorian calendar year and reached its peak today due to the Chiang government's promulgation of export subsidy and import surcharge measures, as well as the subsequent massive speculation by the Kung, Soong, Chiang, and Chen families. In the forty days from the beginning of the year to the first ten days of this month, prices in Beijing and Shanghai have risen by an average of more than 150%. On the 3rd of this month, the Chiang government suddenly announced new import and export trade measures, causing gold and U.S. dollars to rise even more wildly, the legal tender to plummet, and prices to soar. On the 10th and 11th, prices rose by an average of 60%, with some items even doubling. However, gold reached its peak on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, rumors suddenly spread in the Beijing and Shanghai area that the Legislative Yuan would pass a resolution "nationalizing gold." At the same time, in several major cities, the Chiang government authorities successively issued orders prohibiting the buying and selling of U.S. dollars. Xuan Tiewu, the Shanghai Police Chief, even ordered the search of rice shops. As a result, gold prices in various places plummeted sharply from the 12th, with many silver shops even refusing to accept gold. However, prices not only did not fall accordingly but continued to rise.

At this point, the market was in chaos. In Shanghai, rice was available but not sold for three or four consecutive days from the 11th, with rice shops closing their doors and refusing to sell. Similar situations occurred in other cities. Many small and medium property owners could not make a living and vented their anger on rice shops and silver shops. On December 1st, a silver shop in Nanchang was destroyed by the masses for refusing to accept gold. Several silver shops in Xuzhou were also destroyed. Shanghai citizens, unable to buy rice, destroyed several rice shops in one district alone and took the rice away. In Fuzhou, "people are dying of starvation every day" due to soaring prices. In Guangzhou, those lining up to buy food at various subsidized canteens resembled a long snake. These lines were usually comprised of working-class poor, but recently, many middle-class citizens and civil servants have been found mixed among them. Due to the high prices, they have lost even their last shred of self-respect. According to the "Central News Agency," the main figures in the gold and U.S. dollar case are Soong Tzu-wen and Kung Hsiang-hsi, etc., and the involvement is quite broad. Public opinion in Beijing and Shanghai is criticizing them one after another. Kung Hsiang-hsi has been openly attacked by many newspapers in Shanghai, which have determined that he manipulated the gold market in Shanghai. Yu Hongjun stated at the Political Participation Council on the 14th: "He has also heard about the use of military salaries to purchase gold in Shanghai." Some newspapers have suggested thoroughly investigating the gold sold by the Central Bank, publishing the names of the major purchasers, demanding the dismissal of Soong Tzu-wen, and investigating the property of Soong and Kung. American public opinion is also quite shocked by this, believing that all credit of the legal tender has disappeared and that the Chiang government's economic crisis cannot be saved.

### 四大家族投机操纵  京沪物价暴涨倍半  各地市场极混乱中小产者纷纷破产

　　四大家族投机操纵
    京沪物价暴涨倍半
    各地市场极混乱中小产者纷纷破产
    【新华社延安十五日电】综合各方报导：由于蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族投机操纵而掀起之黄金美钞暴涨暴跌风潮；席卷蒋管区各大城市，整个市场陷于极度混乱。许多中小产者，数日之间纷纷破产。
    此次危机开始于阳历年初，而由蒋政府颁布出口津贴进口附加办法，以及随之而来的孔、宋、蒋、陈四大家族的巨大投机，以至今日达于高点。年初至本月上旬四十天内，京沪物价平均已涨一倍半以上。本月三日，蒋政府突颁布进出口贸易新措施，黄金美钞遂更狂涨，法币狂跌物价飞跃上升。十日十一日两日，物价平均涨了百分之六十，某些物品甚至涨了两倍。但在十一日，黄金涨到最高峰。十二日上午京沪一带，忽盛传立法院将通过决议。“黄金收归国有”同时若干大城市，蒋政府当局先后下令禁止美金美钞买卖。上海警察局长宣铁吾甚至下令搜查米店，结果自十二日起各地金价均剧烈下跌，甚至银楼多拒绝收进，但物价却不但未随之下跌，而且继续上涨。
    这时市场已告混乱。上海自十一日起接连三四日食米有价无市，米店闭门拒售，其他城市亦有类似情形，许多中小产者无以为生，迁怒于米店银楼。十二月一日南昌有一银楼，因拒收黄金为群众捣毁。徐州亦有数银楼被毁。上海市民因买不到米，仅在一区内即捣毁米店多家，把米拿走。福州由于物价飞腾“饿毙者日众”。广州各平价食堂排队购买者，有如长蛇阵。此种行列向为劳苦贫民，日来则发现不少中等市民及公务员夹杂其间。因物价高涨关系，已使彼等仅有之自尊心亦已为之丧失。据“中央社”透露：黄金美钞案之主角为宋子文、孔祥熙等，而牵涉则颇广，京沪舆论对彼等纷纷抨击，孔祥熙被上海许多报纸公开攻击，断定他操纵上海的黄金市场。俞鸿钧在十四日参政会上则称：“彼对利用军饷在沪购买黄金事，亦有所闻。”若干报纸建议彻查中央银行卖出之黄金，公布主要购买者姓名，要求将宋子文撤职；并调查宋孔财产。美国舆论对此也颇为震惊，认为：法币的一切信用，均已消失，蒋政府经济危机无法挽救。
