　　This Newspaper Reporter Comments on the Situation in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Battlefield:
　　Chiang's Troops are Weary of Running Around and are Passive Everywhere, Changing Commanders Three Times in Half a Year and Becoming Increasingly Embarrassed
    [Report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front by our correspondent Qi Yuqing on the 31st] This newspaper reporter, Qi Yuqing, commented on the fact that Chiang's troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield are tired of running around and are passive everywhere, saying: Two months ago, a general on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front said, "When Chiang's troops are fighting, their commander is less Bai Chongxi or Chen Cheng, and more General Liu Bocheng." Consider that in November last year, after Chiang Kai-shek's direct line American-equipped Fifth Army and the 75th Division invaded Juancheng and Yuncheng, General Liu's troops advanced with great strides, using the tactic of "piercing the heart like a tiger" to break into the depths of Chiang's army, quickly wiping out its command center, and annihilating two of Chiang's brigades, totaling ten thousand men. This victory threatened Xinxiang, shocked Kaifeng, disrupted the entire Chiang army deployment, and forced the Chiang army on the eastern front to transfer troops in a hurry. The Eighth Route Army on the eastern front then recovered Juancheng on November 20. The Chiang army, who were isolated in Yuncheng, also fled south on November 22. In early November, Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly clamored to attack Daming and Handan, and to join forces in Xingtai, and transferred his 85th Division from Xinxiang to Anyang in the north. But before it could stand firm, Wuzhi was attacked by our local troops, and Xinxiang and Jiaozuo were simultaneously alarmed, so they rushed to aid Jiaozuo on November 18, and then increased defenses in Xinxiang on the 20th. Then they went east to Hua (County) and Jun (County), and cooperated with the Fifth Army, the 75th Division, the 32nd Division and other troops, and separately occupied Puyang, Qingfeng, Neihuang, Guancheng, Nanle, Daming and other counties, in an attempt to realize their dream of advancing north to occupy Handan and Xingtai, and to open up the Pinghan Railway line. However, General Liu then marched south, starting with the recapture of Juye and Jiaxiang and the siege of Jinxiang on New Year's Day, followed by the recovery of Chengwu, Dingtao, Shanxian, and Caoxian, directly approaching the Longhai Railway. As a result, the Fifth Army, which was entrenched in Nanle and Qingfeng, had to rush south overnight to reinforce the Kaifeng-Minquan line, and Guancheng, Puyang, Nanle, Qingfeng and other cities were successively recovered by us. At present, the Chiang army on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front is in a state of embarrassment, running around and unable to attend to everything. In the past six months, the results of our army's eight battles and eight victories have forced the invading Chiang army in Hebei, Shandong and Henan to change commanders three times. In the Battle of Dayang Lake in September last year, the entire 3rd Division was annihilated, and Liu Zhi was kicked out of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters; as soon as Gu Zhutong came to power, he suffered two serious blows in Juannan and Huaxian. In the 26 days of January, our army recovered 13 county towns, and Hu Zongnan, the anti-communist "expert," replaced Gu Zhutong. How confident is Hu Zongnan that he will not follow the old path of Liu Zhi and Gu Zhutong?

　　本报记者评冀鲁豫战场形势：
    蒋军疲于奔命处处被动半年三易主帅日益狼狈
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十一日电】本报记者齐语顷就冀鲁豫战场蒋军疲于奔命，处处被动发表评论称：两月前，冀鲁豫前线某将军曾说过：“蒋军作战，其指挥官与其说是白崇禧、陈诚，毋宁说是刘伯承将军。”试看去年十一月间，蒋介石嫡系美械第五军及七十五师侵占鄄城、郓城后，刘将军所部却大踏步向前滑挺进，以猛虎掏心战术，突入蒋军纵深，迅速扑灭其指挥中枢，歼灭了蒋军两个旅达万人之众。这一胜利，威胁新乡，震动开封，打乱蒋军整个部落，使东线蒋军不得不仓惶四调，东线八路军乃于十一月二十日收复鄄城，孤守郓城之蒋军，亦于二十二日分头南窜。十一月上旬，蒋介石一再叫嚣要进攻大名、邯郸，会师邢台，并将其八十五师由新乡北调安阳，但立脚未定，因武陟为我地方部队袭入，新乡、焦作同时告警，又仓惶于十一月十八日驰援焦作，廿日又增防新乡，然后东出滑（县）浚（县），配合第五军七十五师、三十二师等部队，分头占我濮阳、清丰、内黄、观城、南乐、大名等县，以图实现其北进侵占邯郸、邢台，打通平汉线的梦想。但刘将军于此际挥戈南下，元旦日以连克巨野、嘉祥围困金乡为序幕，紧接着收复了城武、定陶、单县、曹县等城，直迫陇海。这样一来，固守在南乐、清丰一线的第五军，又不得不星夜南下，增援开封民权一线，观城、濮县、南乐、清丰等城，亦先后为我收复。目前，冀鲁豫前线蒋军已处于疲于奔命、顾此失彼的狼狈状态。半年来，我军八战八捷的结果，迫使侵犯冀鲁豫的蒋军三易主帅。去年九月间大杨湖一战，整三师全部被歼，刘峙被踢出了郑州绥靖公署的大门；顾祝同一上台，就遭受了鄄南与滑县两次严重打击，在元月二十六天内，我军收复十三座县城，胡宗南这位反共“能手”又代替了顾祝同上台。胡宗南究竟有多大把握不再走刘峙、顾祝同的老路呢？
