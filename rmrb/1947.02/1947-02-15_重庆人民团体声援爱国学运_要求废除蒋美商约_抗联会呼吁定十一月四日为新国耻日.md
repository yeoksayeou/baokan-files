The declaration stated: "We cannot stand idly by as American goods, running amok, invade the Chinese market and crush national industries. We vow not to recognize the 'Sino-US Treaty of Commerce,' which sells out the nation's lifeline and the ancestors' burial grounds. We must oppose the 'Sino-US Treaty of Commerce' as we opposed the Japanese imperialists' 'Twenty-One Demands,' designate November 4th, the day the 'Sino-US Treaty of Commerce' was signed, as a new national humiliation day, and boycott American goods being dumped on the Chinese market."

Three students were seriously injured, more than ten were slightly injured, and all the theatrical props were destroyed. The representative of the Anti-Japanese Alliance issued a statement to fellow countrymen that evening, denouncing the Kuomintang authorities for condoning the secret agents' sabotage of the students' patriotic movement as extremely shameless, and stating: "We want to solemnly declare that no matter how barbaric the violence, we will never live on our knees, we will die standing up, die in the camp of patriotism!"
