The Land Reform Movement in Nanweiquan
·Xiao Hanqing·
	I. Class Conditions Before the Movement
	Nanweiquan administrative village, under the jurisdiction of the fifth district of Licheng, includes several small villages such as Chapengtan, Dongshan, and Qiaoshang. Nanweiquan was the location of the political and economic ruling group. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the four major landlord families, Zhang, Wang, Li, and Wei, successively served as the head of the village (社首), controlling the political power. Whenever they had weddings, funerals, or festivals, the poor people of each village, especially the poor people who reclaimed land in Dongshan, had to send gifts of money and grain. Any delay would result in being tied up, beaten, or expelled. According to statistics, the total value of gifts sent by the poor each year was enough for their own New Year expenses. Another form of extra exploitation was the annual "mountain price" of 200 silver dollars forced upon the poor people of Dongshan, otherwise they were not allowed to reclaim land. Land rent was as high as six to seven dou per mu. Farmer Shen He rented four mu of land from landlord Wang Yulan. The annual output was one shi and six dou, but the rent was two shi and four dou. Unable to pay the rent, he was forced to flee to Yueyang and became a beggar. Usury included forms such as "black donkey rolling" (黑驴打滚 - compounding interest rapidly) and "one-cent interest" (老一分 - very high interest). Farmer Jia Youfu borrowed 12 yuan from landlord Wei Yuqi. As a result of compounding interest, he mortgaged his house and his only five mu of land. His son was forced to join the army, and he joined an opera troupe.
	After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the democratic government was established, and extra exploitation was greatly reduced. Through the mass movements of 1942 and 1944, landlords retreated some land due to rent reduction and sales, and the peasants were initially mobilized. However, because the focus was on settling accounts based on problems at that time, cadres did not pay enough attention to ideological mobilization, and the rent reduction period was also limited (the law stipulated from the 29th year of the Republic of China), and the positions of village head and deputy village head were occupied by old rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, so the movement was very incomplete, and the phenomenon of clear reduction but secret non-reduction was serious. Zheng Fusheng, a poor peasant from Qiaoshang, returned the rent grain reduced during the day to landlord Wei Yuqi at night, and apologized, saying, "This is the cadre's fault," it was not what he wanted. The landlord took the opportunity to change the rented land into mortgaged land, hiding his assets. Wang Yulan then transformed into a "self-cultivating middle peasant" with only 20 mu of land, but his mortgaged land reached 84 mu. At that time, this kind of mortgaged land accounted for a little less than 11% of the total land in the village. Many original tenants became mortgagors. Tenant Zhao Jin, a family of four, had no privately owned land (死契地), and only relied on nine mu of mortgaged land to survive. In Dongshan, 83 people only had 31 mu of privately owned land, an average of less than 0.4 mu per person.
	According to a survey, before the "fill-in-the-blanks" movement last winter, the land ownership, tenancy, and mortgage relationships of all classes in the village were as follows:
	Land Ownership by Class: Landlords: 27 households, 104 people, accounting for 5.6% of the total population, 947.79 mu of land, an average of 9.11 mu per person, accounting for 22.2% of the total land, actually operating 511.7 mu. Rich peasants: 40 households, 153 people, accounting for 8.3% of the total population, 706 mu of land, an average of 4.61 mu per person, accounting for 16.5% of the total land, actually operating 626.8 mu. Middle peasants: 270 households, 949 people, accounting for 51.7% of the total population, 2273 mu of land, an average of 2.4 mu per person, accounting for 53.4% of the total land, actually operating 2468.8 mu. Poor peasants: 107 households, 403 people, accounting for 21.8% of the total population, 330.5 mu of land, an average of 0.82 mu per person, accounting for 7.7% of the total land, actually operating 675.6 mu. Extremely poor: 86 households, 219 people, accounting for 12.3% of the total population, no land, actually operating 217.2 mu. Total: 530 households, 1828 people, 4257.4 mu of land, an average of 2.3 mu per person, actually operating 4500.1 mu. (Note: The land actually operated includes public land and mortgaged land calculated for the village, not included in the land ownership section.)
	Village Tenancy Relationships: Landlords: 9 households, rented out 91 mu (4 mu in and outside the village). Rich peasants: 11 households, rented out 39.9 mu. Middle peasants: 11 households, rented out 42.7 mu (including 2 mu outside the village). A total of 31 households rented out land, 173.6 mu. Extremely poor: 48 households, 135 people, rented in 118.1 mu (including 11.3 mu outside the village). Poor peasants: 58 households, 218 people, rented in 197.5 mu. Middle peasants: 48 households, 179 people, rented in 134 mu (including 10 mu outside the village). A total of 154 tenants, 532 people, 449.6 mu of land. (Note: Includes some public land.)
	Village Mortgage Relationships: Landlords: 20 households, mortgaged out 345.2 mu (including 37 mu outside the village); another 2 households, mortgaged in 8 mu. Rich peasants: 6 households, mortgaged out 47.3 mu (including 8.3 mu outside the village); another 66 households, mortgaged in 170.2 mu (including 9 mu outside the village). Middle peasants: 29 households, mortgaged out 71.6 mu (including 3 mu outside the village); another 46 households, mortgaged in 151.1 mu (including 16.6 mu outside the village). Poor peasants: 2 households, 6 people, mortgaged out 3.5 mu; another 28 households, 70 people, mortgaged in 99.1 mu (including 12.7 mu outside the village). A total of 59 households mortgaged out land, 477.6 mu; 142 households mortgaged in land, 499 people, 428.4 mu.
	From the above, it can be seen that: (1) Landlords account for only 5.6% of the total population of the village, but their land ownership reaches 22.2%; the poor peasant population accounts for 34%, but their land accounts for only 7.7%, and 219 extremely poor people have no land at all. Therefore, the vast majority of extremely poor peasants eagerly demand and support the implementation of land reform. (2) The mortgage relationship between this village and other villages is intertwined, and landlords can easily exploit this loophole to conceal land. A thorough investigation is necessary to completely eliminate feudalism. (3) A considerable number of middle peasants rent out, rent in, mortgage out, and mortgage in land. It is necessary to vigorously mobilize them and appropriately take care of them. Therefore, before the movement, the county and district sent three cadres to the village to assist in the work.

	II. Mass Ideological Preparation
	In early December last year, the "fill-in-the-blanks" movement began. In the preparation stage, it was first discovered that there were many ideological obstacles among the masses. Poor peasant Cui Hehan said, "Why bring up the meat that has been hurt?" Wang Ersuo, a hired laborer for more than 20 years, did not have cotton clothes in winter and still considered himself "born poor." Poor peasant Zhang Youfu did not speak, fearing that speaking would not help and would only bring trouble. In 1944, he requested a rent reduction, but it was not resolved due to the limited period. Landlord Gao Tingbi scolded him in the village office: "Poor people extort people, maggots grow without holes." The village cadres did not support him, and as a result, he was ashamed to go out for three days. Poor peasant Zhao Laoer said, "We fled to Nanweiquan, and only by renting four mu of land from landlord Wei Yuqi did we not starve to death." Poor peasants in Dongshan heard that Wu'an was preparing for war and that Chiang's planes bombed Changzhi, and were "afraid that the Central Army would come." ...
	The masses' fighting spirit was not high and needed to be mobilized urgently; however, there were still many problems in the ideology of the village cadres and their relationships with each other. The cadres first expressed their determination to completely eliminate feudalism and fill in the gaps for the poor households, allowing the masses to freely prepare; on the other hand, they held meetings to review the administrative command style and other issues in the past movement, and conducted self-criticism to improve class consciousness. Zhang Quanlin, director of the militia committee, originally from Gengle Village in She County, when he first moved to Nanweiquan, Wang's landlord family would send people to snatch the wheat harvest whenever it ripened, and he would gain nothing after a year of hard work. During the self-criticism, he sobbed uncontrollably. Political Director Zhang Xiaoji and Farmers' Association Chairman Zhu Fengtang reviewed the impact of their "contradictions" on the movement, and resolved to unite and lead the peasants to completely turn themselves around. On the spot, everyone made a clear division of labor and proposed to use suffering to attract suffering, focusing on mobilizing the poorest of the poor in mountain villages.
	After the meeting, the village cadres carried luggage and food and went to small mountain villages such as Dongshan, Qiaoshang, Baiyugang, and Gaojiagou, starting with one person and one group to organize self-criticism.
	In Baiyugang, Zhang Quanlin used his tragic experience when he first arrived in Nanweiquan to guide the poor peasants from other places to speak out about their suffering. Yao Wandang, who was oppressed by Wei Yuqi's high rent, was awakened and became an activist. The method of tracing history had a good effect in various villages, especially enlightening the elderly. Shen He was driven off his land by Wang Yulan in the 19th year of the Republic of China. His daughter had to become a child bride, and his child died without care. He fled to Yueyang to beg for food... Thinking of these things, he burst into tears and became active from then on. After finding the root of poverty, Wang Ersuo said: "You can't get rid of poverty if you don't expose your money. When you become a hired worker, your body gets ruined, you always take medicine, you spend countless money, and your wages are low, so you have to be poor." The idea of being "born poor" was broken. The masses in Baiyugang and other villages conducted a review of the history of the War of Resistance, dispelling "concerns about the change of regime." He Xiaowo said: "We defeated Japan, what are we afraid of the Central Army, let alone the old rich." In this way, from point to surface, a mass self-criticism movement was formed with individual self-criticism, small chats, people with grievances looking for people with grievances, and people with suffering looking for people with suffering. One hundred and five new activists emerged from this. They united with the old activists, helped each other (the new activists criticized Zhang Xiaoji for protecting the landlords in the past), and connected with each other, greatly encouraging the fighting spirit of the masses. Hired laborer Wang Maicheng often said, "Movement, movement, isn't it just the same old thing?" This time, he was determined to settle accounts with Wang Yulan.
	Seizing the peasants' high hatred for the landlord class, the leadership proposed the voluntary formation of turn-over groups, and on this basis, six turn-over brigades were formed, and a turn-over committee was elected. However, 28 middle peasant households in Chapengtan were excluded from the turn-over groups. Middle peasant Hu Choutang had many grievances to express, but the extremely poor peasants did not allow him to participate in the organization because he had been "fooled" before. The leadership immediately proposed that "middle and poor peasants are one family, and they all have suffering," and carried out education. Hu Choutang also "washed his face" to the masses. The middle peasants then all joined the movement. The turn-over committee then proposed to divide classes and determine the targets of struggle. After heated discussions in each group, Wei Yuqi and other four major landlords were determined as "centralized targets," and Li Jintang and other 24 households were determined as "second-class targets." However, the fourth team determined 51 target households. After repeated discussions, everyone clarified the idea that "farmers all over the world are one family, unite to turn themselves over," distinguished the middle peasants and emerging rich peasants, consolidated the peasant camp, and attacked the landlord class together.

	III. Tortuous Struggle Process
	Based on in-depth self-criticism, clarifying class boundaries, organizing peasants, and raising class consciousness, the leadership loudly put forward the slogan "Return the grain you ate, return the rice you ate." The struggle of the peasants to unite and settle accounts with the landlords for their blood and sweat began victoriously on December 12.
	The original plan was to first settle accounts with the four major landlords. Due to the fact that ideological problems had not been better resolved, as soon as the battle began, some peasants felt "no problem" and became passive. One group of fifteen households in the second team only had eight households left when they settled accounts with the landlord that night, and all seven old middle peasants went to sleep. Some peasants lost their direction of struggle. Poor peasant Yang Huoer demanded to solve family problems first and settle accounts with his brother Yang Panrong (middle peasant). ... The peasant camp became chaotic, and the leadership immediately put forward the slogan "Everyone unite, everyone turn over," and the first group of the second team launched heated criticism and self-criticism. Zhu Pang reflected: "I am an old middle peasant, I am afraid of not getting anything, and I am also afraid of hurting feelings... I will definitely help my poor brothers turn over in the future." From the discussion of the landlords' persecution of everyone, each group clarified that: your problem is also my problem, my problem is also your problem, and middle and poor peasants established a close relationship. The struggle was re-launched, and the method was a combination of general meetings and group settlements. In the turn-over group, the peasants boldly calculated their own accounts and submitted them to the turn-over committee for research. At the general meeting, they collectively reasoned with the landlords. After the meeting, each group took turns settling blood and sweat accounts with the landlords.
	At the settlement meeting on the 16th, Wei Yuqi, Wang Yulan, and others admitted that exploitation was unreasonable, but in addition to land, they only repaid the masses a few hundred yuan in cash, and said a lot of empty words such as "try to repay the masses' blood and sweat accounts" in an attempt to paralyze the peasants.
	At the same time, the peasants, after preliminary settlement, had already divided a batch of fruits (land, houses, livestock) and became complacent. Jia Youfu said, "It's almost enough!" As a result, many peasants did not participate in the struggle. The leadership then guided the peasants to calculate the changes in the landlords' property from history and explained that, based only on the known materials, Wei Yuqi had lent 300 yuan in cash and rented out more than 100 mu of land. Wang Yulan was a "government official family" in the old society, and his ancestors had served as Daotai, and his father, the "third young master," had served as the magistrate of Xuchang (Qing Dynasty). They owed the masses more than 3,000 shi of grain alone. Only taking out that little bit of stuff was obviously refusing to pay. After discussion, the masses were freed from the landlords' trap, and the struggle continued. However, Wei Yuqi always resisted the peasants' just struggle with his "stubborn" attitude. Even after four general meetings and five group settlement meetings of fierce struggle, he still refused to give up anything. It turned out that Wei Yuqi had joined the Yan Special Organization "Jingjian Society" through the special agent Fan Kerren in 1943 and had a set of reactionary tricks, which he now used to be stubbornly stubborn. He shamelessly said that he originally had money and bought things, "If I have money, I'll take it out, wouldn't that be great?" Wang Yulan tried to soften the peasants and let the tenant Yang Huoer beat him a few times to vent his anger.
	Due to the landlords' rascality and deception, some peasants were again tired. Zhao Jin said, "Let's put it aside and do it again." Some said, "How long will this go on?" Some middle peasants became onlookers, neither actively offering opinions nor actively taking action, but just "watching the fun" on the sidelines. Some even developed sympathy for the landlords. Political Director Zhang Xiaoji actually helped Wei Yuqi calculate his accounts from history, saying that he bought land and houses in such and such years, "The money may be gone."
	Faced with the task of improving the peasants' fighting spirit, the leadership put forward slogans such as "Don't forget the pain after the scars are revealed," mobilized further self-criticism, and reawakened class consciousness; on the other hand, they organized activists to check out 105 documents and postings called "poor seedlings" from the homes of Wei Yuqi and Gao Tingbi to educate the peasants with these practical materials. Because in the movements of 1942 and 1944, the landlords had already reported that the documents and postings were completely lost and wrote "recovery" for the rent reduction and interest reduction masses. Now, things were completely clear, and the peasants further recognized the landlords' conspiracy, and their hatred greatly increased, and they beat Wei Yuqi one after another. However, Wei Yuqi still treated them with a "stubborn" attitude.
	At this time, the peasants analyzed the landlords' rascal thoughts and estimated that their hidden properties were concentrated and placed together, fearing complete exposure and "cutting off the roots." They then changed the method of struggle, letting the landlords find guarantors and set a time limit for delivering a certain amount of property. In this way, the stalemate was broken, and the landlords' "stubborn" tricks were shattered. Soon, Wei Yuqi, Wang Yulan, and others handed over more than a thousand cash yuan and several silver ingots. The peasants' fighting spirit was even higher, and they put forward the slogan "Fight to the end," raising the movement a step further.
	While continuing to settle accounts with the four major landlords, they also settled accounts with the "second-class targets." However, in terms of the method of struggle and the method of accounting, the peasants distinguished between the primary and secondary objects. For the four major landlords, in addition to recovering the capital, they also calculated interest. The four major landlords admitted that this was what they deserved, saying that this method of calculation was "the way they used to do it." For the "second-class targets," they only calculated a little interest. They also held a forum for "second-class targets" to let them solve problems with the peasants faithfully and automatically. As a result, they took out more hidden wealth than the four major landlords and were quite stable. Wang Shugui said after repaying the masses' blood debts: "I can rest assured now."
	The fierce settlement struggle once involved the problem of middle peasants. Poor peasant Zhang Lao Han once asked to settle family problems with middle peasant Zhang Shutian (village chief). Some extremely poor peasants had the idea that "life is good, but we still have to do it even if there is no problem." This caused middle peasants to worry about being "cut like chives." Emerging rich peasant Xu Guangfu donated ten mu of land, and some middle peasants were uneasy. The leadership then took the labor hero Shi Cunjin of Huo Jia Yao in this county as an example to explain that those who became rich through labor cannot be struggled against, and put forward "cutting off the feudal tail, not cutting off the peasant tail" and "walnuts and dates cannot be counted in the same way." After discussion, the peasants' thinking was raised a step, and they refused to accept Xu Guangfu's donated land, corrected the phenomenon of random struggle, the peasants' unity became more and more consolidated, and they concentrated their efforts to settle accounts with the landlords.
	After several fierce struggles, the peasants gained important victories. On the 20th, a unity meeting was held. At the meeting, the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family, we must share good and bad" was put forward, and the accumulated disputes among the farmers were cleared up through mediation. Zhao Ertou broke a jar of Shen Wuguang. Shen Wuguang said: This is a matter between farmers, it's over after we talk it over. Xu Guanshun mortgaged some of the farm tools of the poor peasant Cheng Jintang. Through mediation, the wealthier Xu Guanshun was allowed to repay three small shi of rice without touching the land, houses, or livestock. One side apologized, and the other side made concessions, and the "knots" were untied. Then the cadres and the masses conducted self-criticism with each other. Political Director Zhang Xiaoji admitted his mistakes to the masses - protecting the landlords. Middle peasants Wang Hetu, Wang Tude, Jiang Deyi, Hu Chun, poor peasant Meng Qingde and others also made self-criticism, saying that when they struggled against Wang Yulan in 1944, they protected him, did not offer their own opinions, and helped him explain, not allowing others to offer their own opinions, which affected everyone's turn-over.
	In this section of the movement, the peasants raised a total of 548 issues of rent arrears, debt settlement, wages, bullies, and corruption with the landlords, 264 issues with the feudal rich peasants, and 13 disputes among the middle and poor peasants, all of which were resolved one by one, and the peasants achieved a huge victory.

　　南委泉的土地改革运动
    ·萧寒青·
    一、运动前的阶级状况
    南委泉行政村，辖茶棚滩、东山、桥上等数小村，属黎城五区。南委泉是政治经济统治集团所在地，抗战前，张、王、李、魏四大地主世袭依次担任社首，掌握政权。他们每逢嫁娶，或过年过节，各村贫民，特别是东山开荒贫民，必须送钱、粮等礼物，稍有迟误，或则捆吊毒打，或则驱逐出境。据统计，贫民每年送礼总值，足够自己过年开支之用。另一种额外剥削，是每年逼使东山贫民交纳二百元现洋的“山价”，否则不准开荒。地租高达每亩六斗至七斗。农民申和，承租地主王玉兰四亩地，常年产量一石六斗，租额却是二石四斗，交不起租，被迫远逃岳阳，流为乞丐。高利贷有黑驴打滚与老一分等形式。农民贾有福，借地主魏玉奇十二元，滚利叠息的结果，押光了房子和仅有的五亩地，儿子被迫出去当兵，他进了戏班子。
    抗战后，民主政权建立，额外剥削大减。经一九四二、四四年群运，地主因退租变卖了部分土地，农民初步发动；但因当时是以问题为中心算账，干部注意思想发动不够、退租年限也有限制（法令规定自民国二十九年始），而村长、村副等职位，又为旧富农、富裕中农占据，故运动很不彻底，明减暗不减现象严重存在。桥上贫农郑福生白天收回退租粮，夜里又给地主魏玉奇背回去，并赔礼说：“这是干部的过”，不是他愿意减租。地主乃乘机将租地改作典地，隐蔽自己。王玉兰遂一变而为仅有二十亩地的“自耕中农”，其典地却达八十四亩。当时此种典地占全村土地总量的百分之十一弱，不少原佃户变为承典人。佃户赵进，四口人，无一亩死契地，只靠九亩典契地过活。东山八十三人，只有三十一亩死契地，每人平均不足四分。
    据调查，去冬填平补弯运动前，全村各阶层占有土地及租佃、典当关系情况如下：
    各阶层土地占有：地主二七户，一○四人，占总人口百分之五·六，土地九四·七九亩，每人平均九·一一亩，占土地总量百分之二十二·二，实际经营五一一·七亩。富农四○户，一五三人，占总人口百分之八·三，土地七○六亩，每人平均四·六一亩，占土地总量百分之十六·五，实际经营六二六·八亩。中农二七○户，九四九人，占总人口百分之五十一·七，土地二二七三亩，每人平均二·四亩，占土地总量百分之五十三·四，实际经营二四六八·八亩。贫农一○七户，四○三人，占总人口百分之二一·八，土地三三○·五亩，每人平均·八二亩，占土地总量百分之七·七，实际经营六七五·六亩。赤贫八六户，二一九人，占总人口百分之一二·三，无土地，实际经营二一七·二亩。总计全村共五三○户，一八二八人，土地四二五七·四亩，每人平均二·三亩，实际经营四五○○·一亩。（按：实际经营土地中有公地及典租算村土地，未统计在土地占有项内。）
    全村租佃关系：地主九户，租出九一亩（内外村四亩）。富农一一户，租出三九·九亩。中农一一户，租出四二·七亩（内有外村二亩）。以上共出租户三一，地一七三·六亩。赤贫四八户，一三五人，租入一一八·一亩（内有外村一一·三亩）。贫农五八户，二一八人，租入一九七·五亩。中农四八户，一七九人，租入一三四亩（内有外村一○亩），以上承租户共一五四，人五三二，地四四九·六亩。（按内有公地一部。）
    全村典当关系：地主二○户，典出三四五·二亩（内有外村三七亩）；另有二户，典入八亩。富农六户，典出四七点三亩（内有外村八·三亩）；另有六六户，典入一七○·二亩（内有外村九亩）。中农二九户，典出七一·六亩（内有外村三亩）；另有四六户，典入一五一·一亩（内有外村一六·六亩）。贫农二户，六人，典出三·五亩；另有二八户，七○人，典入九九·一亩（内有外村一二·七亩）。全村出典户共五九，地四七七·六亩；承典户一四二，人四九九，地四二八·四亩。
    从上述情况看：（一）地主仅占全村人口百分之五·六，土地占有则达百分之二十二·二；贫农人口占百分之三十四，土地则仅占百分之七·七，赤贫二百十九人，指地皆无。故广大赤贫农热切要求与拥护土地改革之贯彻。（二）典租关系本村与外村交错，地主易钻此空子，隐瞒土地，须深入清查，始能彻底消灭封建。（三）中农有相当数量的出租、承租、出典、承典土地，既须大力发动，又需适当照顾。故运动前县区即派出三个干部，前往该村协助工作。
    二、群众性的思想酝酿
    去年十二月初，整平补齐运动开始。在酝酿阶段中，首先发现群众思想障碍颇多。贫农崔合汉说：“疼过的肉提它干什么！”二十多年的雇工王二锁，冬天没有棉衣，还自认“天生命穷”。贫农张有福不说话，怕说了不顶事，反讨没趣。四四年他曾要求退租，因年限限制未获解决，地主高庭璧反在村公所骂他：“穷人讹人，没孔生蛆”，村干部没给他撑腰，结果羞得他三天不敢出门见人。贫农赵老二说：“逃荒到南委泉，全凭租了地主魏玉奇四亩地，才没饿死。”东山贫农听说武安备战，蒋机炸了长治，“怕中央军过来”。……
    群众斗争情绪不高，急待发动；但村干部的思想上、相互关系上也还有不少问题。干部乃一面表明彻底消灭封建、填平贫户的决心，让群众自由酝酿；一面开会检讨过去运动中的行政命令作风等问题，并进行诉苦，以提高阶级自觉。武委会主任张全林，原籍涉县更乐村，移至南委泉之初，每当麦子成熟时，王家地主即派人抢割，自己忙碌一年，一无所获。诉苦中，他哭不成声。政治主任张孝吉、农会主席朱逢堂，检讨了互相“闹矛盾”给运动的影响，决心团结一致，领导农民翻透身。当场大家作了明确分工，提出以苦引苦，突击山庄窝铺，深入发动痛苦最深的赤贫农。
    会后，村干部们背上行李粮食，分头深入到东山、桥上、白玉港、高家沟等小山庄，从一个人一个组入手组织诉苦。
    在白玉港，张全林以初到南委泉时的悲惨遭遇，引导外来户赤贫农诉苦。使在魏玉奇高租压榨下的姚完旦觉悟起来，成为积极分子。追溯历史的方法，在各村收到良好效果，特别有力的启发了老年人。申和于民国十九年被王玉兰下了地，女儿只好给人家作了童养媳，孩子失养夭折，他逃到岳阳讨饭……想到这些，他痛哭流涕，从此积极起来。经过找穷根，王二锁说：“不是揭钱穷不了，当了雇工，身子弄坏，老是吃药，花钱没数，工资寥寥，不得不穷”。“天生命穷”的思想打破。白玉港等村群众，进行了抗战史回忆，解脱了“变天顾虑”。何小凹说：打败日本，还怕什么中央军，更不怕老财。这样经点到面，形成个别诉苦、三五闲扯、有冤人找有冤人、有苦人找有苦人的群众性的诉苦运动。从中涌现出一百零五名新的积极分子，他们与老积极分子团结一致，互相帮助（新积极分子批评了张孝吉过去包庇地主），互相串连，大大鼓舞了群众斗志。雇工王麦成常说：“运动运动，还不是那么回事”，这次也坚决要和王玉兰清债。
    抓紧农民对地主阶级高昂的仇恨情形，领导上提出自愿结合翻身小组，并在此基础上组成了六个翻身大队，选出翻身委员会。但茶棚滩有二十八户中农被关在翻身小组的门外，中农胡丑堂，有许多苦急着要诉，赤贫农却不让他参加组织，因为他以前上过“当”。领导上当即提出“中贫农是一家，都有苦”，进行教育，胡丑堂也向群众“洗了脸”。中农遂全部卷入运动。翻身委员会乃提出划阶级，确定斗争对象。各组经热烈讨论，确定魏玉奇等四大地主为“集中对象”，李金堂等二十四户为“二类对象”。但第四队却确定了五十一户对象，经过反复讨论，大家明确了“天下农民是一家，团结起来齐翻身”的思想，把中农、新兴富农划出来，巩固了农民阵营，齐向地主阶级进攻。
    三、曲折的斗争过程
    在深入诉苦，划清阶级界限，农民组织起来，并提高了阶级觉悟的基础上，领导方面响亮提出“吃谷还谷，吃米还米”的进军口号。农民团结一致向地主清算血汗账的斗争，于十二月十二日胜利展开。
    原定计划是：首先清算四大地主。由于思想问题未更好解决，刚一交锋，部分农民便感到“没有问题”而消极起来。二队一个十五户的小组，当夜和地主算账时，只剩了八户，七户旧中农全睡觉去了。有的农民则失掉了斗争方向。贫农杨活儿，要求首先解决家庭问题，要和他哥哥杨泮荣（中农）算账。……农民阵营紊乱起来了，领导上当即提出“大家团结，大家翻身”的口号，二队一组遂展开了热烈的批评与自我批评。朱胖反省说：“我是旧中农，怕分不到东西，还怕伤情面……以后我一定帮助穷兄弟翻身。”从讨论地主对大家的迫害中，各组明确了：你的问题也是我的问题，我的问题也是你的问题，中贫农建立起血肉关系。斗争重新展开，方式是大会与小组清算结合。在翻身小组里，农民大胆的自己算自己的账，并提交翻身委员会研究。大会上集体与地主讲理，会后，各组轮番和地主算血汗账。
    十六日清算大会上，魏玉奇、王玉兰等承认了剥削无理，但除土地外，只偿还了群众几百元现洋，还说了一顿“尽量还群众的血汗账”等空话，图以此麻痹农民。
    与此同时，农民经初步清算，已分得一批果实（地、房、牲口），自满起来。贾有福说：“可差不多啦！”于是，好多农民不参加斗争了。领导上便引导农民从历史上计算地主的财产变动，并说明仅就知道的材料来讲，魏玉奇放了三百元现洋的债，租出一百多亩地。王玉兰在旧社会里是“官宦人家”，祖上当过道台，他父亲“三少爷”当过许昌的知县（清代）。他们光欠群众的粮就在三千石以上，只拿出那点东西，显系赖账。经过讨论，群众从地主的圈套中解脱出来，斗争继续展开。但魏玉奇始终以其“硬顶一态度，抵抗农民的正义斗争。虽经四次大会，五次小组清算的激烈斗争，还是一毛不拔。原来魏玉奇一九四三年即经特务樊克仁介绍，参加了阎特组织“精建会”，颇有一套反动诡计，这时便施展起来，要死顽固。还无耻的说什么原来有钱，都买了东西，“要有钱，拿出来，还不是呱呱叫”。王玉兰则图软化农民，让佃户杨活儿打他几下出出气。
    由于地主的无赖和欺骗，部分农民又呈现疲劳。赵进说：“搁搁再搞吧。”有的说：“这样搞下去，搞到什么时候？”一部分中农则观望起来，既不积极提意见，更不积极行动，只在一旁“看稀罕”。有的则产生怜悯地主情绪。政治主任张孝吉，竟帮助魏玉奇从历史上算账，说那年那年买了地买了房，“钱或者没有了”。
    面对着提高农民斗志的任务，领导上一面提出“不要揭了疮疤忘了疼”等口号，发动进一步诉苦，重新唤起阶级觉悟；一面组织积极分子从魏玉奇、高廷璧家检查出农民叫做“穷秧”的一百零五张文书和揭帖，以此实际材料，教育农民。因为在一九四二、四四年运动中，地主即已报过文书揭帖完全损失，给退租退息群众写了“收复”。现在，事情完全清楚了，农民进一步认识了地主的阴谋，仇恨心理大增，纷纷扭打魏玉奇。但魏玉奇仍以“硬顶”态度处之。
    此时，农民便分析地主的无赖思想，估计他们的隐蔽财产集中的放在了一起，怕完全暴露，“割了根”，乃转变斗争方式，让地主找保具结，限期交付一定数额的财物。这样，僵局打开，地主“硬顶”诡计被粉碎。不久，魏玉奇、王玉兰等交出千多现洋和若干元宝。农民斗争情绪更加高涨，提出“斗争斗彻底”的口号，把运动提高了一步。
    在继续清算四大地主中，同时清算“二类对象”。但在斗争方式与算账方法上，农民区别了对象的主次。对四大地主，除索回血本外，并计算利息。四大地主承认这是应该的，说这种算法是他们“打下的样子”。对“二类对象”则只稍算一点利息。并召开“二类对象”座谈会，让他们自己忠实的自动的与农民解决问题。结果他们比四大地主拿出的暗财还多，并且情绪相当稳定。王书魁在偿还群众血账后说：“心可放下啦。”
    激烈的清算斗争，曾牵连到中农问题。贫农张老汉曾要求和中农张书田（村长）清算家庭问题。有的赤贫农则存在着“生活好，没问题也要搞”的思想。引起中农怕“割韭菜”的顾虑。新兴富农许光富献地十亩，部分中农情绪不安。领导上便以本县霍家窑劳动英雄石寸金为例，说明劳动发家的不能斗，并提出“割封建尾巴，不是割农民尾巴”，“核桃枣不能一律数”。经过讨论，农民思想提高一步，拒受许光富献田，纠正了乱斗现象，农民团结益趋巩固，集中力量清算了地主。
    经过几次激烈斗争，农民获得了重要胜利。二十日，乃举行团结大会。会上，提出“天下农民是一家，有好有歹要担待”的口号，用调解方式，扫清了农民间的积存纠纷。赵二头打过申五广一个缸，申五广说：这是农民间的事，说清楚了就算完。许官顺押过贫农程金堂的若干件农具，经调解，让生活富裕的许官顺，在不动地、房、牲口原则下，偿还了三小石米。一方道歉，一方让步，“疙瘩”解开。接着干部群众互相进行了检讨。政治主任张孝吉向群众承认了错误——包庇地主。中农王合秃、王土德、江德义、胡春，贫农孟庆德等也作了自我批评，说一九四四年斗王玉兰时，包庇了他，自己不提意见，还帮他解释，不让别人提意见，影响了大家翻身。
    这一段运动中，总计农民向地主提出退租、清债、工资、恶霸、贪污问题五百四十八件，向封建富农提出二百六十四件，中贫农之间纠纷十三件，均一一获得解决，农民获得了巨大胜利。
