　　Surrendered KMT Platoon Leader Flees with Weapons
    Disarmed by the Masses
    [This Newspaper, Taihang, 24th] Jiang Huaqing, a KMT platoon leader who surrendered, killed two of our soldiers and attempted to escape, but was disarmed by our masses. On January 15th, Jiang Huaqing, platoon leader (special agent chief) of the 1st Platoon, 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Regiment, 7th Division of the KMT army in Huolu, and seven soldiers surrendered to our Jingxing Independent Battalion. Our local military and civilians expressed a warm welcome. However, they betrayed their faith. On the 21st, under the instigation of special agent Jiang Huaqing, they killed two of our soldiers and attempted to escape, forcing our militiamen to lead the way. Our militiamen led them towards the mountains while notifying the masses in various villages. Immediately, the masses of the entire Jingxing District, men, women, old and young, each wielding sickles, axes, and clubs, first blocked the main roads of each village, and then pursued them towards the mountains. Although Jiang and the others possessed American-style machine guns and other weapons, under the power of our masses' soaring anger and shouts of killing, they had no choice but to surrender and hand over their guns. One of them still tried to resist, and was killed by the masses. The masses immediately seized one machine gun, one submachine gun, six rifles, one pistol, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. Pointing their fingers at these untrustworthy people, the masses said: "The people of the liberated areas are not to be bullied. If you sincerely cooperate with us to fight Chiang Kai-shek, we will be like brothers. If you do this, we will not be polite."

　　投降蒋军排长携械逃跑
    当被群众解除武装
    【本报太行廿四日电】蒋军排长姜华青向我投降后，杀我战士两名，企图逃跑，当被我群众解除武装。上月十五日获鹿蒋军第七师二十团一营一连一排长（特务长）姜华青及士兵七名，向我井陉独立营投降，我当地军民曾表示热烈欢迎。但彼等背信弃义，廿一日在特务姜华青策动下，竟杀死我两名战士，企图逃跑，并强迫我民兵带路。我民兵则一面带至大山一带，一面通知各村群众。一时全井陉一区群众，男女老少，人人手持镰刀、斧头、棍子，首将各村要道封锁，然后向大山一带追击。姜等虽持有美式机枪等武器，但在我群众怒气冲天杀声四起的威力下，只好屈服缴枪。其中一名仍图顽抗，当被群众击毙。群众即将机枪一挺、冲锋枪一支、步枪六枝、手枪一支、子弹千余发全部缴获。并手指此等有信者说：“解放区的人民不是好欺负的，你们要诚心和我们合作打蒋介石，咱们就和亲兄弟一样，要是这样做，我们就没有客气讲”。
