　　TASS Broadcast
    Urges Britain to Fulfill its Alliance
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. According to United Press and Associated Press dispatches of the 28th and 29th, TASS broadcasts are strongly urging Britain to fulfill the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. TASS stated: "No one can say that Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union is in line with the principles and requirements of the alliance treaty." The agency further stated: "Britain, together with the United States, has jointly opposed the Soviet Union on numerous occasions. Although Britain has not formally concluded an alliance treaty with the United States, no one doubts the existence of a close, de facto military alliance between Britain and the United States. The time has come to abide by the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty, especially the part that stipulates that the two countries should jointly undertake the organizational work of European security and economic prosperity." It is reported that TASS's broadcast was issued hours after the new Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Georgy Zarubin, held a lengthy meeting with Bevin. According to Moscow Radio, the Red Star newspaper commented on the 28th on the foreign press's hype about the exchange of notes between Stalin and Bevin, believing that "British newspapers are trying to emphasize that this move has caused great satisfaction among all parties." The Red Star newspaper commented: "Empty talk about discussing the extension of the Anglo-Soviet treaty cannot practically solve the problem of Anglo-Soviet allied relations. Superficial recognition of the treaty is of little significance."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. London report: The British government convened a cabinet meeting on the 28th. It is generally believed that cabinet members discussed Stalin's proposal to revise the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty.

    力促英国履行盟约
    【新华社延安三十日电】据合众社美联社二十八、廿九日电讯报导，塔斯社广播正力促英国履行英苏同盟条约。塔斯社称：“谁也不能说英国的对苏政策是符合同盟条约的原则和要求的。”该社又称：“英国和美国一起曾有不少次的共同出而反对苏联，虽然英国并未正式与美国缔订同盟条约，谁也怀疑英美之间存有亲密的事实上具有军事同盟的关系。遵守英苏盟约精神，尤其是遵守规定两国应联合担负欧洲安全与经济繁荣的组织工作的那一部分，现在已是时候了。”据悉：塔斯社的广播是在苏驻英新大使乔治·查鲁宾与贝文作长时间会谈之后数小时发出的。又据莫斯科广播，红星报于二十八日评论国外报纸对斯大林与贝文交换照会之事的渲染时，认为“英国报纸力图着重指出此举已引起各界所有人士的十分满意”。红星报评称：“空谈讨论英苏条约的延期，是不能在实际上解决英苏盟国关系问题的，在表面上对于条约的承认，它的意义是不很大的。”
    【新华社延安三十电】伦敦讯：英政府于二十八日召集阁议，一般认为阁员们曾讨论了斯大林关于修改英苏同盟条约的建议。
