Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st – Explosion squads from Tan County and Ju County inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy invading Linyi in early February. One day and night, they laid nine mines before and after Tadian, and the next morning, when the enemy advanced north, one squad was blown up. During this period, they crossed the Shu River twice at night to lay 46 mines between Zhangzhuang and Nanhua Highway, and planted 35 mines inside and outside of Tancheng. When the enemy entered the city, they exploded successively, forcing the enemy to have two men push a stone roller ahead to clear the way when they went out to attack, only advancing five li per day.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st – Wang Da Niang of a certain district in Zhao＠ (north of Pixian County, Xinxian County), Southern Shandong, remained unyielding in the face of danger and made great contributions to protecting public grain. Last year, when the 26th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army (now completely annihilated) invaded Lanling, Wang Da Niang, who was over sixty years old, was unable to escape and was captured by the enemy, who forced her to reveal the location of public grain storage. Wang Da Niang endured torture with wooden sticks, cold water, and chili water, sternly answering the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers: "I won't say it even if you cut me into a thousand pieces!" She died and was revived twice in this manner, never revealing the secret. Wang Da Niang's injuries have not yet healed, and she is lying in bed. She said to the representatives of the democratic government who came to comfort her: "As long as we protect the grain we earned with our blood and sweat, it's worth sacrificing my old life!"

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st – After the Chiang Kai-shek army occupied Tancheng, the county's democratic government immediately led residents of villages occupied by Chiang to evacuate to safe areas, ensuring the safety of the masses' lives and property and creating great difficulties for the enemy. The preliminary experience is as follows: (1) Sufficient organizational work must be done in advance. The masses to be evacuated from each village should be organized into groups of five neighboring households, with a group leader elected. Each village should be a company or detachment, led by a stronger village cadre. In case of emergency, the groups should gather at the district, led by the village cadres, and evacuate. (2) Strengthen education and strengthen the confidence of the masses. During the evacuation, they should be inspired to discuss "How Chiang Kai-shek treats us when he comes" and "Chiang Kai-shek's army is bound to be defeated, and our army is bound to win," so that they can understand clearly and act consciously, and lead the militia to participate in guerrillas and stick to working in place. (3) Adequate material preparation. First of all, the masses' livestock should be organized, and grain and firewood should be transported to the rear. Immediately organize them to produce and break the simple "escape" mentality. At the same time, mobilize the masses in the rear, love and help each other, and provide them with material and spiritual care and comfort.

　　鲁南遍布地雷进犯军遭重挫
    赵＠王大娘临难不屈立大功
    【新华社山东二十一日电】郯县、莒县各县爆炸队于本月上旬予进犯临沂之敌以重大杀伤。一日夜在塌店前后布雷九枚，次晨敌北犯时一个班被炸。在此期间，曾两次夜渡沭河至张庄南湖公路间布雷四十六枚，在郯城内外埋下三十五枚，敌进城时先后爆炸，逼使敌出犯时先使两人推一石滚前行开路，每天行军只五里。
    【新华社山东二十一日电】鲁南赵＠（新县邳县北）某区王大娘临难不屈，立下保护公粮大功劳。去年蒋军二十六师（现已全部被歼灭）侵犯兰陵时，年逾花甲的王大娘未能走脱，被敌抓去逼供公粮储存地址。王大娘忍受了木棒、凉水、辣椒水等毒刑，严正的回答蒋军：“零刀子切了我也不说！”如此死而复苏者两次，始终未泄露秘密。王大娘至今刑伤未愈，卧在床上，向去慰问她的民主政府代表称：“只要保住咱们血汗换来的粮食，搭上我这条老命也值得！”
    【新华社山东二十一日电】蒋军侵占郯城后，该县民主政府即领导蒋占各村居民转移至安全地带，群众生命财产得以保障，并给敌人以极大困难。其初步经验如下：（１）事先要作充分的组织工作。应将每村转移群众按邻居五家编为一组，自选组长，以一村为一中队或分队，由一较强村干部带领，在情况紧急时按组集合到区，由村干部率领转移。（２）加强教育，坚定群众信心。转移时要启发他们讨论“蒋介石来时对咱怎样”及“蒋军必败我军必胜等问题，使其认识清楚，成为自觉的行动，并领导民兵参加游击队，坚持原地工作。（３）充分的物质准备。首先应将群众的牲畜组织起来，将粮食柴草运到后方，立即组织他们生产、打破单纯“逃跑”思想。同时发动后方群众，互爱互助，予以物质与精神上的照顾和安慰。
