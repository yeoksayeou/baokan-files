Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Fourteenth. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents have intensified their suppression of the patriotic movement. On the 8th of this month, Chongqing students were again brutally beaten by Chiang's special agents while conducting patriotic propaganda. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's Chongqing dispatch on the 9th: The Chongqing Students' United Association Against American Atrocities propaganda team, consisting of 212 people, set out from Shangqingsi at 11:00 a.m. on the 8th to conduct propaganda in Jiangbei. While passing Datong Road, they were surrounded and blocked by hundreds of thugs. The assailants dispersed after ten minutes of continuous beating. Thirteen members of the Anti-Atrocities League were seriously injured, and more than twenty were slightly injured. Several of the seriously injured had their heads cracked open by wooden sticks and stones, and were bleeding profusely. One female student, after having her head cracked open, fainted in a pool of blood and was dragged out and beaten again by the thugs. On the night of the 8th, the presidium of the Anti-Atrocities League received reporters and reported on the details of the tragedy. However, Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing headquarters shamelessly decided in the official gazette of the same day that the Anti-Atrocities League should be held responsible for all actions regarding the two incidents (the first beating occurred on the 5th) in which Chongqing students conducting anti-atrocity propaganda were brutally beaten by thugs. Student Anti-Atrocity Leagues in Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other places are preparing to voice their support for the Chongqing case. The Shanghai Chinese Academic Workers Association issued an "Appeal to Compatriots Regarding the Anti-Patriotic Atrocities in Chongqing" on the 9th.

    平津沪杭等地学联激愤正拟支援
    【新华社延安十四日电】本月八日，重庆学生在进行爱国宣传中，再次遭蒋记特务凶殴。据沪大公报重庆九日讯：重庆学生抗议美军暴行联合会宣传大队，二百十二人，于八日十一时自上清寺出发，再赴江北宣传，行经大同路时，遭遇数百暴徒包围阻击，连续十分钟，打手始散，抗联人员重伤十三人，轻伤二十余人，重伤中有数人头部为木棒及石块击裂，血流如注，内一女学生头部被击裂后，晕倒在血泊中，复被暴徒拖出殴击。抗联主席团八日夜，招待记者报告惨案经过，但蒋介石重庆行辕，于同日之官报中，对渝学生抗暴宣传者两次（第一次被殴事发生于五日）被暴徒痛殴事件，均无耻决定、要抗联负一切行动的责任。现平、沪、津、杭、京各地学生抗暴联合会，均已准备为渝案声援，沪中国学术工作者协会，于九日发表“为渝反爱国暴行告同胞书”。
