Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. The Liaoji Democratic Allied Forces returned to Tanglatuohai, north of Nong'an, Jilin Province, on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The people were beaming and said, "Welcoming the God of Happiness on the first day of the Lunar New Year, we have truly welcomed the God of Happiness." An old man named Du, over seventy years old, walked to the door with a limp, staring at the rosy and strong faces of the soldiers, and said, "Since you left, the 'Step-by-Step Tighteners' (referring to the Chiang troops) have come again and arrested 'National Soldiers' here four times. Now that you have come, the fifth time 'National Soldiers' won't be arrested." At that time, wind and snow were flying in the sky, and the folks quickly cleaned the houses and took the soldiers in to rest. The landlord boiled water and chopped grass to feed the horses, not allowing the breeders to do it. The boys jumped and ran to each house to count how many soldiers and horses had come. A twelve-year-old girl, Du Guanhua, pestered her mother and said, "Mom, I want to join the Eighth Route Army. Look, there are several female Eighth Route Armies in that house!"

　　“正月初一迎喜神”
    民主联军回到唐拉沱海
    【新华社东北十五日电】辽吉民主联军在新春的大年初一又回到了吉林省农安北面的唐拉沱海。老百姓眉飞色舞地说：“正月初一迎喜神，可真把喜神接来了。”一位七十多岁的老杜蹒跚地走到门口，凝视着战士们绯红健壮的脸说：“自从你们走后，又来了‘步步紧’（指蒋军）这里已经抓了四次‘国兵’，现在你们来了，第五次‘国兵’可抓不成了。”当时天空飞舞着风雪，老乡们赶紧打扫房舍，把战士们接进去休息。房东一面烧水，一面铡草喂马，不让饲养员动手。男孩子们蹦蹦跳跳，跑到各家去数，到底来了多少人马。十二岁的小姑娘杜官花纠缠着母亲说：“妈妈，我要参加八路，你看那屋里有几个女八路呢！”
