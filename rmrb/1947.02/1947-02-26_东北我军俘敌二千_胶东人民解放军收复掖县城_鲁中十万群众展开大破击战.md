　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The main force of the Chiang army invading the Linjiang area of ​​Andong Province continued to suffer heavy losses, and another regiment and an engineer battalion were wiped out. The Chiang army, which launched this (third) invasion, concentrated parts of the 12th Army, the New 6th Army, the 71st Army, and the 60th Army, and launched an arc-shaped attack from four directions: west, southwest, and northwest. The 91st Division of its 71st Army attacked from Sanyuanpu East of Tonghua North on the 18th. The Democratic Allied Forces annihilated its 27th Regiment and the entire engineer battalion directly under the division in the area of ​​Dongxi Gaoling Chengzi, northeast of Tonghua, on the morning of the 22nd, capturing more than two thousand people alive. The vanguard of the 2nd Division of the 52nd Army of the Chiang army invading the southern line of the Linjiang area attempted to outflank the position of the Democratic Allied Forces south of Xiaohuangou on the morning of the 21st, but failed and was partially eliminated, capturing more than two hundred people alive. Its 26th Division of the New 6th Army was still blocked by the Democratic Allied Forces in the Xiangmuqiaozi area south of Tonghua; the 21st Division of the Provisional 21st Division of the 60th Army of the Chiang army, which invaded from the northwest, was wiped out a regiment by the Democratic Allied Forces on the night of the 17th, capturing more than 1,300 people alive (see this newspaper on the 22nd). After retreating, they dared not move for several days. In total, since the Chiang army launched its offensive on the 18th, it has lost more than 3,000 people in the past week, and no progress has been made on all four routes.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th] The Jiaodong Eighth Route Army recovered Yexian City on the 18th. The Chiang army, which had long clamored to attack Longkou and Yantai, abandoned the city and fled west. Since the Chiang army launched a large-scale attack on southern and central Shandong, it has successively transferred the 8th Army, the Honorary 1st Division, and the 103rd Division, which had invaded the Yexian area, to the west, leaving only the 166th Division of the army to guard the empty city. The Jiaodong Eighth Route Army cooperated with the local armed forces to press them, and the surrounded Chiang army finally abandoned the city and fled on the morning of the 16th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th] Since the 26th of last month, 100,000 people in Boshan and other places have carried out seven consecutive days and nights of large-scale sabotage warfare, which has greatly hindered the military transportation of the Chiang army attacking the northern line of southern Shandong. In the past ten days, the Boshan local armed forces forced the Chiang army entrenched in Xishidian to withdraw, completely destroyed all seventy-three large and small fortifications they had built, and demolished a bridge. The Zizhong people's armed forces attacked the Xishidian Chiang army stronghold forty miles west of Boshan on the 9th, killing and capturing eighteen Chiang soldiers.
