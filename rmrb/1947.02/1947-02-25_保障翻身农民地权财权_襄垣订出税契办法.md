　　To Guarantee the Land and Property Rights of Emancipated Peasants
    Xiangyuan Enacts Deed Tax Measures
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 23rd] In order to guarantee the ownership of land and houses acquired by emancipated peasants and to promote the great production movement, the Xiangyuan County Government has enacted three deed tax measures: 1. The deed tax price for newly distributed land and houses to peasants shall be determined by the masses themselves through discussion. The standard for land price shall be 30% to 70% of the average annual grain yield (i.e., the price of land yielding one *shi* of grain can be three to seven *dou*). Each kiln cave is equivalent to one *mu* of medium-quality land, and three rooms are equivalent to one kiln cave. 2. If landlords conceal houses and land by renting, pawning, or giving them to others, they shall all be taxed according to the newly distributed land and receive tax deeds, and the landlord's original deeds shall be invalidated. 3. The deeds of the enemy and puppet government in the newly liberated areas are invalid and must be taxed and deeded again. In order to completely crush the landlord's restorationist ideas, all the landlord's original汇契 deeds will be burned. At present, villages are organizing discussions and will complete them before the spring plowing.

　　保障翻身农民地权财权
    襄垣订出税契办法
    【本报太行二十三日电】为保障翻身农民取得土地房屋所有权，开展大生产运动。襄垣县府订出税契办法三项：一、农民新翻身分配之田房，税契价格，由群众自己讨论确定，土地价格的标准，为平年产粮三成至七成（即产粮一石地价可为三斗到七斗）。窑每孔和中等地一亩同，房三间顶窑一孔。二、凡地主为隐藏房地，出租出典或自给别人者，一律按新分配地领纸税契，地主之原契作废。三、新区敌伪政府之契纸无效，须重新税契。为彻底打垮地主的复辟思想，并把地主的原汇契全部焚烧。现各村已有组织的进行讨论，于春耕前即可完成。
