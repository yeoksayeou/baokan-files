　　【Taihang News】 With the Qingming Festival approaching, the Taihang Administrative Office issued a notice to the entire region to plant trees, stipulating that each person in the masses and organizations must plant one tree and guarantee a survival rate of 70 percent. Local agricultural and forestry bureaus, farms, and villages should immediately organize and lead this work. At the same time, vigorously publicize forest protection, promote private or cooperative management of forest farms, and encourage the existing custom of planting trees alongside crops among the masses. Wasteland suitable for afforestation should be allocated to private individuals, the closure of mountains should be continued, and forest protection covenants should be formulated according to local conditions.

　　清明将届太行号召植树
    【本报太行讯】清明将届，太行行署通令全区植树，规定群众与机关团体每人须植树一株，并保证活百分之七十。各地农林局、农场及各村均应立即组织领导这一工作。同时大力宣传护林，提倡私人经营或合作经营林场与群众中存在的伴种树等习惯。应将适于造林之荒山空地划归私人，继续恢复禁山，根据各地情况制定护林公约。
