Thirty Heavy Chains
An Introduction to the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce
Yan Ling

In early February 1946, Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek concocted a scheme to deceive the Chinese people: while ostensibly agreeing to a ceasefire order and convening a Political Consultative Conference, the U.S. government was in fact more actively helping Chiang Kai-shek to prepare new offensives against the Chinese people. At the same time, the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce began to be secretly negotiated in Chongqing.

By November 4th, after Chiang Kai-shek violated the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and arbitrarily issued the pseudo-“National Assembly” convocation order, and before this farce had even begun, Chiang Kai-shek was suffering military setbacks everywhere and was mired in a political quagmire. The Sino-American Treaty of Commerce was formally signed in Nanjing by Wang Shijie, Stuart, and others. The next day, it was passed by the Chiang government's Executive Yuan at its regular meeting, and on the third day, it was approved by the Chiang government's Supreme National Defense Council at its 209th meeting. On the fifth day, it completed the "legislative formalities" at the 311th regular meeting of the Chiang-controlled Legislative Yuan. Prior to this, Chiang Kai-shek had sold various Chinese sovereign rights to the United States piecemeal and in batches. This time, he used a "complete" and "legal" form to "consolidate" all of these. Such an important treaty, with "administrative formalities" and "legislative formalities" completed so quickly, is rare in history.

The full name of this treaty is the "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation." The scope of "friendship" is very broad, certainly not purely commercial. This treaty includes international trade, commerce, finance, exchange, industry, mining, agriculture, cultural, educational, and even travel, residence, construction, land purchase, lawsuits, inheritance, and even military-related rights and activities, large and small, all meticulously considered and meticulously arranged. The full text consists of thirty articles, with the Chinese version being over 15,000 characters long. Each sentence is an interlocking iron ring, and each article is a heavy chain. Many chains are intertwined into a net, trapping the entire of China and presenting it to the financial capital oligarchs of the United States!

Apart from several articles that are superficially unequal, most of the articles simply state "this party" and "that party," seemingly "equal and reciprocal" on the surface. But what about in reality? Even Zhang Zhaoyuan, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chiang-controlled Legislative Yuan, said in his report on November 9th: "The economic strength of the two countries is vastly different. The wording of the treaty is indeed very equal, but reciprocity is questionable!"

Let's take a look at the full text of the treaty:

Article 1 is just a few "official and high-sounding" empty words, stating that "peace and friendship should be maintained forever between the Republic of China and the United States of America." In reality, the U.S. government is helping Chiang Kai-shek attack the Chinese people and is undermining the friendship between the Chinese and American people. The meaning of this clause is simply "peace and friendship should be maintained forever between the Chinese and American reactionaries."

According to Article 2, Americans are permitted to "reside, travel, and do business throughout the territory" of China, "without being subject to unreasonable interference," and "shall not be required to apply for or carry any travel documents other than a valid passport or other identification document issued by their own competent authorities." Americans in China "shall be free from interference in engaging in and operating commercial, manufacturing, processing, scientific, educational, religious, and charitable enterprises," as well as various occupations (!). They can also freely build houses, lease land, and select agents and employees of any nationality. The most insidious part is the addition of the following sentence: "to engage in any matter ( !) as may be occasionally needed ( !) or necessary ( !) to enjoy any such rights and preferences." Under "the same conditions," they enjoy the same treatment as Chinese people. But can Chinese people go to the United States to enjoy these "rights and preferences"? Let's see: "Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed to affect the existing laws of either Party relating to immigration." This means that the U.S. "immigration laws" restricting Chinese people from entering the country remain in effect.

According to Article 3, "corporations and associations" within the United States (including "limited liability or unlimited liability and profit or non-profit (!) corporations, companies, partnerships, and other groups (!) that have been or will be (!) created or organized") should "have their legal status recognized" in China, allowing them to "establish branch offices and carry out their tasks." They can engage in the many businesses that Americans (individuals) can engage in under Article 2 within Chinese territory, but with the addition of "finance." That is to say, these company bosses can set up banks in China, handle deposits, loans, and remittances, and even issue banknotes to do U.S. dollar business (in fact, U.S. dollars have long been freely circulating in China). These companies and groups can also freely build houses, lease land, and select agents or employees of any nationality in China, and can engage in "any matter" that is "occasionally needed" or "necessary" "without interference." But if Chinese "corporations and associations" want to go to the United States, they must abide by the laws of each state due to the different laws in each state of the United States. They cannot go to a state that does not allow them, and they cannot engage in businesses that a state does not allow.

According to Article 4, U.S. nationals and "corporations and associations" can organize "corporations" or "associations" in China, or participate in Chinese "corporations" and "associations," and can exercise management and managerial powers within them, and can engage in the businesses listed in the previous article.

According to Article 5, if the right to explore and develop Chinese mineral resources is granted to any other country, it must also be granted to the United States. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek has successively sold the development rights of oil, aluminum, antimony, manganese, and other mines in Northwest China, Shandong, Hunan, Taiwan, and Northeast China to U.S. imperialism.

According to Article 6, U.S. citizens throughout China "shall enjoy the most constant protection and security for their persons and property." "Any person accused of a crime shall be promptly tried." While in custody, they "shall enjoy reasonable and humane treatment." Their property in China "shall not be taken without due process of law and prompt payment of fair and effective compensation." Moreover, they can "obtain foreign exchange on the most favorable terms to withdraw compensation." U.S. nationals, corporations, and associations "shall have freedom to bring actions before the courts and administrative tribunals of all grades throughout China, to select lawyers, translators and representatives, whether for the purpose of instituting or defending their rights," just like the Chinese. U.S. corporations and associations without permanent establishments, branch offices or agencies in Chinese territory may also exercise the above rights "without any formalities of registration or enrollment." Moreover, if there is a dispute between Americans and Chinese, it can be resolved by "arbitration." The decision of the "arbitrator" shall be given "full faith" by all Chinese courts. ("Arbitration" is "arbitration," and this institution is attended by people from both countries, such as the recently formally established "Sino-American Commercial Arbitration Association," which is a disguised revival of consular jurisdiction.)

According to Article 7, Americans' "residences, warehouses, factories, shops, and other places of business, and all appurtenant premises, shall not be unlawfully entered or disturbed," "no such residence, building, or premises shall be entered for inspection or search, and no books, papers, or accounts therein shall be examined." Even if there is "any inspection, search, or examination permitted by any exception to this Article," "due regard shall be had for the convenience of the occupant of such residence, building, or premises and for the ordinary conduct of any business or other enterprise therein, and interference therewith shall be kept to the minimum extent consistent with the necessities of the case."

According to Article 8, Americans in China may own real property or other immovable property and may freely dispose of such immovable property. However, "if any State, Territory, or possession of the United States of America now or hereafter does not permit nationals, corporations, and associations of the Republic of China to acquire, hold, or dispose of real property and other immovable property on the same conditions as nationals, corporations, and associations of the United States of America, the foregoing provisions shall not apply."

According to Article 9, within Chinese territory, "the exclusive right to their inventions, trademarks, and trade names" and "the enjoyment of rights to their literary and artistic works" of U.S. nationals, corporations, and associations "shall be effectively protected," and the rights and preferences enjoyed shall not be lower than those of Chinese nationals, corporations, and associations.

According to Article 10, U.S. nationals, corporations, and associations residing, doing business, or engaging in other enterprises in China "shall not be subject to any internal taxes, fees, or charges other or higher than" those levied on Chinese nationals, corporations, and associations.

According to Article 11, when U.S. "commercial travelers" "enter, sojourn, and depart" Chinese territory, they cannot be charged more taxes than "commercial travelers" from any third country.

According to Article 12, Americans in China have freedom of belief, worship, establishing schools, preaching, or teaching "other knowledge (!)," and shall not be subject to any hindrance or disturbance because of religious belief or "other reasons (!)."

According to Article 13, if Americans in China are harmed, injured, or die, their relatives or heirs in the United States have the right to sue and have the right to obtain monetary compensation, just like the Chinese.

Article 14 is even more serious: "If at any time either Contracting Party is engaged in hostilities with any third country ( !) or countries in the application of measures for the fulfillment of its obligations for the maintenance of international peace ( ?) and security ( ?), or engaged in any action involving the employment of land or naval forces ( !) in common with any third country or countries, then general compulsory military service, either by land or sea" requires that Americans can participate in the Chinese army and navy, and Chinese people must also participate in the American army and navy in the United States.

Article 15 is a "reaffirmation" of supporting international schemes for "the elimination of all discriminatory treatment and monopolistic restrictions in international commerce" and "the expansion of international trade." This is obviously intended to make China a vassal of the United States in the U.S. expansionist economic aggression policy. In reality, in the vast ocean of international trade, only U.S. monopoly capital has the possibility of running rampant. China will not be able to gain any benefits.

Article 16 stipulates that China should give the same treatment no less than that afforded to her own citizens and third-party nations and associations to any nation, association or citizen of the U.S. with regard to tariffs, surcharges, or handling fees levied on any exported or imported item (in China, exported items are mainly "seedlings" and "products"; imported items are mainly "manufactured goods"); "indirect trade" (such as U.S. merchants transporting Japanese goods to China for sale) "shall not be unnecessarily impeded." Even more unfavorable to China is the provision that no prohibition or restriction shall be imposed on import, export, sale, distribution, or use. This is precisely the poisonous scheme of "industrial America, agricultural China" and the ambition of the United States to monopolize the Chinese market and Chinese raw materials.

According to Article 17, the customs tax rates of all ports in China must be uniform; when tax rates are increased, they must be announced quickly, and goods that have already been shipped en route at the time of announcement cannot be taxed according to the increased tax rate after arrival. Moreover, "within thirty days after the aforementioned date of announcement," goods imported for "consumption" ( ?) are "customarily exempt from such newly established or increased burden." The most wonderful thing is that "if there are documentary errors in the import of products or manufactured goods, and such errors are obviously due to clerical errors or can be proven to be in good faith,... no penalty higher than nominal shall be imposed."

According to Article 18, the internal taxes to be paid on American goods after entering China cannot be higher than the taxes paid on Chinese domestic goods. The same applies to goods grown, produced, or manufactured by Americans in China.

According to Article 19, when the Chinese government establishes or maintains any form of control over "methods of international payment" (such as how money should be given and received for foreign countries buying raw materials or selling goods in China, and how profits, dividends, or interest received from investment or loans in China should be given and received) and "international financial trade" (such as exchange, deposits, and loans between countries) (such as prohibition, restriction, delayed payment of remittances, and increases or decreases in exchange rates and taxes or fees on exchange transactions), the United States must be given treatment no less than that of any third country and must not affect the "competitive relationship" of the United States with any third country, causing the United States to "suffer disadvantage." The control of these matters must not be more favorable to the Chinese than to the Americans.

According to Article 20, state-owned enterprises or public institutions established by the Chinese government for import, export, purchase, sale, distribution, or production, or any institution authorized to grant these privileges, shall give American commerce "fair treatment" in the purchase of foreign goods or the sale of goods exported to foreign countries. When purchasing or selling any goods, such state-owned enterprises or institutions "shall be governed entirely" by purchase and sale conditions such as price, quality, sales channels, and transportation. This means that China must buy "cheap and high-quality" American goods, and the United States has a lot of money and can offer high prices, so Chinese raw materials must be sold to it.

Article 21 is also relatively important. According to it, ships flying the American flag and having American nationality certificates have the freedom to load cargo and sail to "all ports, places, and territorial waters of China now or in the future open to foreign commerce and navigation," including "all ships," "whether private or privately operated, or public or publicly operated."

Following this, Article 22 stipulates that American ships and the goods they carry shall receive the same treatment in Chinese ports and territorial waters as Chinese domestic ships and cargo. Regardless of where these ships come from, or where they are going to. The taxes and other fees to be paid on these ships and goods in Chinese ports and territorial waters shall also not be more than those on Chinese ships and cargo. The provisions on passengers, tickets, and freight on ships must also not give Chinese ships any preferential treatment over American ships. What is most infuriating is that this article also stipulates: American ships (including warships and fishing boats) "compelled by stress of weather or by reason of any other distress ( !) to take refuge in any port, place, or territorial waters of China" "open to foreign commerce or navigation ( !), such ships shall receive friendly treatment and assistance, as well as necessary and available supplies and repairs."

According to Article 23, American ships shall not pay more taxes or fees than Chinese ships for exporting from or importing into China all goods. When Chinese ships are rewarded or favored, American ships must also enjoy the same reward or favor.

According to Article 24, American ships can unload and load cargo in any port, place, and territorial waters of China without paying more taxes than Chinese ships.

According to Article 25, people and baggage (regardless of whether they are American or not) coming directly or indirectly from the United States or going to the United States, as well as American people and baggage coming from or going to any place, and goods coming directly or indirectly from or going to the United States, "shall be granted freedom of transit over the most convenient routes for international transit" through China, and shall not be subject to "transit taxes," and shall not be subject to delays or restrictions. These baggage and goods can also be stored in the Chinese customs house for them without paying a deposit, and when they are to be transported for export within one year, "shall be exempt from all customs duties or similar charges." In this article, a sentence is also revealed: "Special provisions shall be made regarding non-landing flights of aircraft."

Article 26 is several annotations to the above articles, of which two points are worth noting: First, China cannot cite the preferential treatment given by the United States to Cuba and the Philippines as precedents. But China can cite any preferential treatment given to any other country as a precedent for the US. Second, "The provisions of this Treaty shall not be construed as granting any right or privilege to the organization or participation of corporations and associations engaged in political activities." This has the effect of preventing the activities of Chinese and American people's organizations.

Article 27 explains that the "territory" of "both parties" mentioned in this Treaty includes all land and water areas, "except the Panama Canal Zone."

Article 28 stipulates that "disputes" between "the two governments" regarding this Treaty can be submitted to the International Court of Justice, or they can "be resolved in other peaceful ways without submitting it to the International Court of Justice." In fact, between the obedient Chiang Kai-shek, the child emperor, and his handy American father, what "disputes" could there be?!

Article 29 states that once this treaty takes effect, it will "replace" (!) many treaties previously signed between China and the United States (the Five-Port Trade Regulations of 1844, etc.). This shows that this treaty is a comprehensive collection of all past unequal treaties.

Article 30 is almost an order: "This Treaty shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Nanking as soon as possible"!

Two other points are worth noting: almost every article in the Treaty contains the phrases "in accordance with the laws and regulations now or hereafter enforced by lawfully constituted authorities" and "not less than the treatment accorded to any third country." Regarding the former, we know that under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government, "laws and regulations" are only made to protect the interests of the ruling class minority; the so-called "lawfully constituted authorities" can actually be "constituted" by Chiang Kai-shek at will, and they will be "constituted" specifically to carry out the will of U.S. imperialism. (Such as the "Sino-American Police-Military Joint Operations" "authorities" in Beiping). China still does not have a democratic constitution recognized by the people, and the existing "authorities" are only produced by the reactionary Kuomintang clique. Regarding the latter, it is actually the revival of the "most-favored-nation clause," which is specifically stipulated to ensure that U.S. imperialism monopolizes China. (End)

　　三十条沉重的锁链
    蒋美商约介绍
    燕凌
    一九四六年二月初，马歇尔和蒋介石定下了欺骗中国人民的诡计：表面上答应下停战令、召开政治协商会议，背地里美国政府就更积极帮助蒋介石对中国人民布置新的进攻。同时，蒋美商约就偷偷摸摸地在重庆正式开始谈判了。
    到十一月四日，在蒋介石违背政协决议擅自颁布伪“国大”召集令以后，在丑剧还没有开场之前，蒋介石在军事上处处失利，而政治上又陷于疆局的时候，蒋美商约由王世杰和司徒雷登等在南京正式签了字，第二天就经蒋政府行政院例会通过，第三天就经蒋政府国防最高委员会二○九次会议批准，第五天就在蒋记立法院第三一一次例会上完成“立法手续”了。在这以前，蒋介石就把中国的各种主权零星分批出卖给美国不少，这一下子就用“完整”的“合法”的形式把这些都“巩固”了起来。如此重大的条约，“行政手续”和“立法手续”完成得这样快，是历史上少有的。
    这个条约的全名是“中美友好、通商、航海条约”，“友好”所包括的范围大得很，决不单纯是商业性质。在这条约中包括国际贸易、商业、金融、汇兑、工业、矿业、农业、文化、教育等事业，以至旅行、居住、筑屋、买地、陈诉、遗赠、继承……甚至有关军事的各项权益与活动，大大小小一切问题，真是设想得十分周详，无微不至。全文共三十条，中文本长约一万五千余字，一句一句都是互相扣紧的铁环，一条一条都是沉重的锁链，许多锁链又交织成天罗地网，把整个中国套起来奉送给美国的金融资本寡头们！
    条文上除了好几条在表面上也不平等外，大都只是说“此方”“彼方”，表面上似乎是“平等互惠”的。可是，实质上呢？连蒋记立法院外交委员会委员长张肇元十一月九日报告审查意见时也说：“两国经济力量悬殊，条约字面固极平等，但互惠则有问题！”
    我们试把条约全文拿来看看吧：
    第一条只是几句“官冕堂皇”的空洞的漂亮话，说什么“中华民国与美利坚合众国间应常保和好，永敦睦谊”。实际上美政府却正帮助蒋介石进攻中国人民，正在破坏着中美人民之间的友谊。这一条款的意义，只是“中美反动派间应当保和好，永敦睦谊”。
    按照第二条，应许美国人在中国“领土全境内居住旅行及经营”，“不应受不合理之干涉”，并且除了美国“本国主管官厅所发给之有效护照或其他身份证明文件外，应无须申请或携带任何旅行文件。”美国人在中国，应“不受干涉从事并经营商务、制造、加工、科学、教育、宗教及慈善事业”、以及从事的各种职业”（！）。而且可以随便建筑房屋，租赁土地，选用任何国籍的代理人和员工。最狠毒的是下面还加上一句：“从事为享受任何此项权利及优例所偶需（！）或必需之任何（！）事项”。在“同样条件下”行使这些“权利和优例”和中国人所受的待遇完全相同。而中国人能不能到美国去享受这些“权利和优例”呢？且看：“本约中任何规定，不得解释为影响纽约任何一方有关入境移民之现行法则”。这就是说，美国限制中国人入境的“移民律”，仍旧有效。
    按照第三条，美国国内的“法人及团体”（包括“业已或将来（！）创设或组织之有限责任或无限责任及营利或非营利（！）之法人公司合伙及其他团体（！）”），在中国都应“承认其法律地位”，允许其“设立分事务所，并执行其任务”。在中国领土内从事经营第二条所载的美国人（个人）所能从事经营的那许多事业，不过格外还多加了一种“金融”事业。就是说这些公司老板可以在中国设立银行，办理存款、放款、汇兑甚而发行钞票作美钞生意等（实际上美钞在中国早已可以自由流通了）。这些公司、团体在中国也可以随便盖房子、租土地，选用任何国籍的代理人或员工，并可从事“偶需”或“必需”的“任何事项”，而“不受干涉”。可是中国的“法人和团体”要到美国去，则因美国各州法律的不同，到那一州就得遵守那一州的法律，那一州不许去就不得去，那一州不许经营的事业就不许去经营。
    按照第四条，美国国民以及“法人和团体”可以在中国组织“法人”或“团体”，也可以参加中国的“法人”和“团体”，可以在里面操管理及经理之权，可以经营前条所列举的那些事业。
    按照第五条，中国矿产资源之探勘及开发的权利，要是给予任何别的国家，就也得给美国。事实上，中国西北、山东、湖南、台湾、东北等地的石油、铝、锑、锰等矿的开发权，蒋介石已经相继出卖给美帝国主义了。
    按照第六条，美国人在中国全境内，“关于其身体及财产，享受最经常之保护及安全”。“凡被控犯罪之人，应迅行审判”。被看管时“应享受合理及人道之待遇”。他们在中国的财产，“非经合法手续并迅付公平有效之偿金，不得征取”。而且，他们可以用“最优厚之条件获得外汇，以提取偿金”。美国国民法人及团体“不论为行使或防卫其权利”，享有向中国各级法院及行政机关控诉、选出律师翻译员及代表人的自由，和中国人完全一样。在中国领土内无常设机构分事务所或代理处的美国法人及团体，也可以行使上述的权利，“而不需登记或入籍之任何手续”。而且，美国人和中国人起了争执，可以由“公断”解决，“公断人”的决定，全中国法院“应予以完全信任”。（“公断”就是“仲裁”，这机构是由两国人都参加的，如最近正式成立的“中美商事公断会”即是，这是领事裁判权的变相的复活。）
    按照第七条，美国人在中国的“住宅、货栈、工厂、商店及其他业务场所，以及一切附属房地，概不得非法进入或侵扰”，“任何此项住宅、建筑物或房地，概不得进入察看或搜查，其中所有之任何书册、文件或账簿亦不得查阅”。即使有“本条之例外规定所许可之任何察看、搜查或查阅”，但“对于此项住宅建筑物或房地之实用人或任何业务或其他事业之通常进行，应予以适当顾及，并尽可能使受最低限度之干涉”。
    按照第八条，美国人在中国可以置地产或其他不动产，而且对这些不动产可以随意处分。但是，“倘美利坚合众国任何州、领土或属地，现在或将来不许中华民国之国民、法人及团体与美利坚合众国之国民、法人及团体在同样条件下取得、保有或处分地产及其他不动产时，则前句之规定概不适用。”
    按照第九条，美国国民法人及团体，在中国领土内，“其发明、商标及商号之专用权”及“其文学艺术作品权利之享有”，“应予以有效之保护”，享受的权利与优例得低于中国国民法人及团体。
    按照第十条，美国国民法人及团体在中国居住、经商或从事其他事业，“概不得课以异于或高于”对中国国民法人及团体“所课之任何内地税，规费或费用”。
    按照第十一条，美国的“旅行商”“进入、暂住及离去”中国领土时，不能对他收比任何第三国的“旅行商”更多的税款。（⑵⑶）
    按照第十二条，美国人在中国有信仰、礼拜、设立学校、传教或传授“其他知识”（！）的自由，不因宗教信仰、或“其他原因”（！）而受任何妨害或侵扰。
    按照第十三条，美国人在中国被害受伤或死亡，其在美国本国的亲属或继承人有控诉权，并有取得金钱补偿之权，和中国人一样。
    第十四条，就更严重了：“缔约双方在任何时期内因对同一第三国（！）或数国施行为履行维持国际和平（？）及安全（？）之措施时，或对同一第三国或数国同时采取敌对行为（！）而施行陆军或海军行动（！）有关之普遍陆海军强迫服役时”，美国人可参加中国海陆军服兵役，中国人在美国亦须参加美国的海陆军服兵役。
    第十五条是“重申”赞同“消灭国际商务上一切歧视待遇及独占性之限制”、“扩充国际贸易”的国际方案。这很明显的是要中国在美国扩张经济劳力的侵略政策中做美国的附庸。实际上在国际贸易的大海里，只有美国独占资本横冲直撞的可能，中国是捞不到什么好处的。
    第十六条规定对任何输出品或输入品（在中国，输出品主要是“种植物”和“出产品”；输入品主要是“制造品”）所征关税、各种附加费用及提货的手续等，中国对美国国民、法人及团体应给予不低于本国及第三国的待遇；对“间接贸易”（如美国商人从日本运日本货来中国销售）也“不得构成不必要之阻碍”。对中国更不利的是还规定了对输入、输出、销售、分配、使用，都不得加以禁止或限制。这正是“工业美国，农业中国”的毒计，也是美国独占中国市场及中国原料的野心所在。
    按照第十七条，中国各港口的关税税率必须一律；提高税率时要很快公布，在公布时已运到中途的商品，运到后不能照提高的税率征税。并且，“在上述公布之日后卅日内”，为“消费”（？）而输入之物品，“照例豁免此项新设或增加之负担”。最妙的还有：“出产物或制造品之输入，如有文件上之错误，而此项错误显系由于笔误或能证明其为善意者，……不得科以高于名义上之惩罚。”
    按照第十八条，美国货物进入中国后应纳的内地税不能比中国国产货物所缴的税较高。美国人在中国所种植出产或制造的商品也一样。
    按照第十九条，中国政府对于“国际支付方法”（如外国在中国买原料或卖货物应给的钱应收的钱及在中国投资或贷款所收的利润红利或利息，怎样给怎样收的方法）及“国际金融贸易”（各国间的汇兑、存款、放款等），设立或维持任何方式的管制时（如禁止、限制、迟延支付汇款及对于外汇的汇率及关于汇兑交易的税款或费用的提高或降低等），对美国要给予不低于任何第三国的待遇，不得影响美国对任何第三国的“竞争关系”，致使美国“蒙受不利”。对这些事项的管制，对中国人也不得比对美国人优待。
    按照第二十条，中国政府关于输入、输出、购买、销售、分配或出产所设立之独占事业或公营机关，或发授与以这些特权的任何机关，在购买外国物品或输往外国物品之销售，应给予美国商务以“公允之待遇”。这种独占事业或机关，于购买或销售任何物品时，“应完全取决于”价格、品质、销路、运输等买卖条件。这就是说，中国一定要买“价廉物美”的美国货，美国钱多，出价高，中国的原料一定要卖给它。
    第二十一条也是比较紧要的，按照它，挂有美国旗、备有美国国籍证明文件的船舶，有装载货物开到中国“现在或将来对外国商务及航业开放之一切口岸地方及领水之自由”，包括“一切船舶在内”，“不论其为私有或私营的，抑为公有或公营的”。
    紧接着，第二十二条又规定美国船舶和所载的货物，在中国口岸及领水内所受待遇应和中国本国船舶及载货一样。不论这些船是从那里开来的，不论它们是要到那里去的。对这些船、货，在中国口岸地方及领水内要征收税款和其他应缴的费用，也不得比中国船、货较多。对船上的旅客、船票和运费等的规定，中国船也不得比美国船享有任何优惠。最令人气愤的是这一条中，还规定了：美国船舶（包括军舰及渔船在内）“由于气候恶劣或因任何其他危难（！）被迫避入中国“对外国商务或航业了（！）开放之任何（！）口岸地方或领水时，此项船舶应获得友好之待遇及协助。以及必需与现有之供应品及修理器材。”
    按照第二十三条，美国船自中国输出或输入中国一切物品，无须比中国船缴更多的税款或费用。要奖励或优待中国船时，美国船也得享受同样奖励或优待。
    按照第二十四条，美国船可以在中国任何口岸地方及领水内卸货、装货，不比中国船缴较多的税。
    按照第二十五条，直接或间接从美国来或往美国去的人和行李（不论是不是美国人），不论从那里来或要到那里去的美国人和行李，以及直接或间接来自或前往美国的物品，“概须给予经由国际交通最便捷之途径”通过中国的自由，不得征收“过境税”，不得予以迟延或限制。这些行李、物品还可以不纳保证金而由中国税关替他们保管，而且在一年内要运送出口时，“应豁免一切关税或类似费用。”在这一条里，还透露出来一句：“关于航空器之不着陆飞行另有约定”。
    第二十六条是几项对于以上条文的注释，其中值得注意的两点是：一、美国给予古巴与菲律宾的优惠，中国不能援例。而中国给予任何别国的优惠，美国都可以援例。二、“本约之规定不得解释为对从事政治活动之法人及团体之组织或参加，给予任何权利或优例。”这是有防止中美人民团体活动之作用的。
    第二十七条解释本约中所说的“双方”的“领土”包括一切水陆区域，“惟巴拿马运河区不在其内”。
    第二十八条规定“双方政府间”关于本约有“争议”时可以提交国际法院，也可以不提交国际法院而“另以其他和平方式解决”。其实，在唯命是从的蒋介石儿皇帝和他的得心应手的美国爸爸之间，还会有什么“争议”呢？！
    第二十九条说，这一条约一生效，就“替代”（！）了中美间以前所订的许多条约（一八四四年的五口通商章程等等）。这正说明了这个条约是集了过去所有不平等条约之大成的。
    第三十条几乎是一条命令：“本约应予批准，批准书应在南京尽速互换”！
    还有两点值得注意的是条约中几乎每条都有“依照依法组成之官厅，现在或将来所施行之法律规章”和“不得低于第三国所受之待遇”的字样。关于前者，我们知道，在蒋介石独裁政府下，“法律规章”都是只为保护统治阶级少数人的利益而制订的；所谓“依法组成之官厅”，实际上蒋介石是可以随意“组成”的，而且是会专为秉承美帝国主义的意志而“组成”的。（如北平的“中美警宪联勤”的“官厅”）。中国至今还没有为人民所公认的民主宪法，现有的“官厅”只不过是国民党反动派一手包办而产生的。关于后者，实际上就是“最惠国条款”的复活，是为了保障美帝国主义单独霸占中国而特别订定的。（完）
