Handan International Peace Hospital
Sets Production and Savings Plan
President Zhu Calls for Promoting a Spirit of Mutual Assistance
[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Handan International Peace Hospital held a production and savings mobilization meeting on February 20th, announcing that the purpose of institutional production is to obtain 3.2 million yuan, the hospital's minimum annual overhead expenses, and the purpose of individual production is to guarantee the fulfillment of one to three hours of specific production tasks. Since Comrade Bo Yibo's call for production and savings was announced, from the president to the janitorial staff, they have been brewing methods for institutional production and individual production and savings plans. Comrades in the pharmacy and some doctors plan to use scientific methods to extract medicinal materials from the Taihang Mountains, not only to complete production tasks but also to expand the scope of rural medical care. Comrades in the nursing class formed mutual aid groups, setting out production methods such as spinning, sewing, grinding tofu, and raising pigs. Doctor Li Youlin and others decided to take care of the hair of all comrades in the hospital (the hospital has no barber), have found the tools, and set a salary of eighty yuan per haircut, guaranteeing the completion of the production task. Sister-in-law Liu, who just rushed from Huguan, heard that the government was calling for production, and she declared that all her expenses for clothing and food would be self-sufficient. She has planned a new spinning wheel and loom, and is preparing to spin and weave in large quantities. Other cooks have planned to use the gaps in cooking to open up land for growing vegetables. The production mobilization meeting announced that the initial determination of institutional production was to open an oil mill, sugar mill, raise pigs, and raise sheep; and reported the detailed production and savings plan of each comrade, such as President Zhu (Lian), whose production task is one hour each, mainly spinning, supplemented by writing. The plan is to spin yarn for twenty-two production days each month from March 1st to the end of the year, seven qian per day, fifteen liang and four qian per month, which is equivalent to 481.25 yuan at the current salary. At the official price of rice at forty yuan per jin, she will get more than 120 jin of rice by the end of the year. The eight to nine days left each month are reserved for outpatient visits and her own illness (she has had stomach problems for a long time); and she will think of drafts on the way to each outpatient visit, and use the manuscript fees to make up for the rice task that is short. In terms of savings, it is determined that she will not receive anything the public provides to her, will not eat the public's preferential small stove dishes and rice, and will try to use waste paper for internal office work. The mobilization meeting also required all comrades in the hospital to conduct an organized study of Comrade Yibo's report and other documents once within three days. It was announced that formal production will begin on March 1st, and all tools and raw materials must be prepared as soon as possible. President Zhu called for: (1) Promoting the spirit of mutual assistance from planning to the entire production process; (2) Using game time for production as much as possible without hindering work and study; (3) In the future, medical work should be more serious, so that patients can recover their health as soon as possible, which includes the meaning of production.
