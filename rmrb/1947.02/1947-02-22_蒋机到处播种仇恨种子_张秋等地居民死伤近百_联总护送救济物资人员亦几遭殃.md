(Transmitted by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 20th) Chiang Kai-shek's planes indiscriminately bombed Zhangqiu Town, the location of our Relief Association and the Yellow River Commission, on the 15th, sowing seeds of hatred everywhere. A batch of UNRRA relief supplies was transported from Kaifeng to Zhangqiu on the night of the 14th. On the morning of the 15th, three American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes flew in from the southwest, reconnoitering and strafing over Zhangqiu for 20 minutes. At 2 p.m., four more American-made giant planes arrived and bombed and strafed in shifts for two hours. Most of the bombs dropped were air-burst and ground-burst types, with more than ten of them being heavy bombs, leaving craters that could swallow a person. Several houses were destroyed in each location. According to preliminary investigations, people were killed or wounded: more than 20 seriously wounded, two of whom were blown to pieces beyond recognition, and four oxen grazing by the village were killed. UNRRA personnel stationed at our branch were terrified. A bomb exploded not far from them, but fortunately, they were not injured. Our Zhangqiu Town is hundreds of miles away from the Longhai front and was originally a place where our Relief Association and the Yellow River Commission entertained foreign guests.

(Transmitted by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 20th) On the 14th of this month, four gentlemen from UNRRA, Rupert Hocinre, Ytoing Barnelt, Pervgi Hnson, and Hasold fohnson, escorted a portion of relief supplies to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area. As soon as they arrived in Zhangqiu Town, they were subjected to two rounds of bombing by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes. They could not escape in time. One bomb landed only a hundred paces away, and fragments flew close to their heads. Fortunately, they were not injured, but they were very frightened by this accident. They believe that Chiang Kai-shek's planes are wreaking havoc and undermining UNRRA's work. They stated that they would report to UNRRA officials and protest to the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Steader (Pcaldstinr) (British), a reporter for the American Christian Science Monitor who came with them, also witnessed the tragic state of the people of Zhangqiu being bombed. This is another consequence of the civil war brought about by U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek.

(Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 20th) Chiang Kai-shek's planes frantically bombed the towns of Juancheng and Juye in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, further arousing the indignation of the military and civilians in the liberated areas. When Chiang Kai-shek's planes attacked Juancheng at 11 a.m. on the 15th, more than 60 Flying Fortresses carried out indiscriminate bombing, killing or wounding 24 residents and destroying more than 130 houses. At the same time, large and small villages within 15 miles of the city were also bombed and strafed by these planes. In Wangshaqin Village, south of the city alone, more than ten people were killed or wounded. Three cart drivers were also wounded on the Yuncheng-Juancheng highway. At the same time, several bombers were dispatched to bomb Juye and strafed and dropped bombs outside the city, killing or wounding 20 residents.

(Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th) On the 12th, a truck carrying relief supplies in Jiaodong, bearing an air defense symbol issued by UNRRA, was strafed twice by Chiang Kai-shek's planes on its way to Fushan County, with several bullet holes in the vehicle.

　　蒋机到处播种仇恨种子
    张秋等地居民死伤近百
    联总护送救济物资人员亦几遭殃
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】蒋机于十五日对我救济分会及黄委会驻地张秋镇滥施轰炸。联总救济物资一批，于十四日夜由开封运张秋，十五日早即有美造蒋机三架，自西南方飞来，在张秋上空侦察扫射二十分钟。下午二时又有美造巨型机四架赶来，轮番轰炸扫射达二小时之久。所投炸弹多为空中爆炸及落地爆炸者，有十余枚，均为重磅炸弹，坑可没人。每处均炸毁民房数座，人民死伤初步调查：重伤二十余人，有二人被炸血肉模糊，村边耕牛四头被炸死。联总驻我分会人员饱受惊恐，一弹在他们身边不远爆炸，幸未受伤。我张秋镇距陇海前线数百里，原为我救济分会及黄河委员会招待外宾之地。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】本月十四日，联总何起色（Rubert Hocinre）巴列弟（Ytoing Barnelt）韩森（Pervgi Hnson）生蒋（Hasold fohnson）四先生，护送救济物资一部来冀鲁豫解放区，刚抵张秋镇，即遭美式蒋机二次轮番轰炸。他们逃避莫及，一炸弹落下仅距百步，碎片近头飞过，幸未受伤，但遭此意外，十分惊恐。他们认为蒋机如此肆虐，破坏联总工作，表示将报告联总负责人，向美蒋提出抗议。同来之美国基督教科学箴言报记者斯梯德（Pcaldstinr）（英籍）亦目睹张秋人民被炸惨状，这是美国援蒋以来又一次招致内战恶果。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线廿日电】蒋机狂炸冀鲁豫鄄城、巨野等城镇，更引起解放区军民愤激。十五日上午十一时蒋机袭击鄄城时，出动空中堡垒六十多架轰击机到处狂轰乱炸，居民死伤二十四人，民房百三十余间被毁。同时城周十五里以内之大小村庄亦遭该机轰炸扫射，仅城南王沙禽一村即死伤十余人，郓城、鄄城大路上亦有三名车夫被炸伤。同时又派数架轰击机轰炸巨野，并在城外扫射投弹，居民死伤二十人。
    【新华社山东二十日电】十二日胶东救济物资汽车一辆，上悬有行总发给之防空标帜，于驶往福山县途中遭受蒋机两度扫射，车身中弹数处。
