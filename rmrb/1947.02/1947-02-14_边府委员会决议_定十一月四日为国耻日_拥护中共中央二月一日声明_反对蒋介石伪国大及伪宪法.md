    Border Region Government Committee Resolution
    Designating November 4th as National Humiliation Day
    Supporting the CCP Central Committee's February 1st Statement
    Opposing Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet National Assembly and Puppet Constitution
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] The Border Region Government's plenary committee on February 10th, on its third day, resolved to designate November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day, support the CCP Central Committee's February 1st statement, and oppose the Kuomintang's unauthorized convening of the puppet National Assembly and puppet constitution. It also decided on three concrete measures: First, to issue a letter to compatriots, designating "November 4th" as National Humiliation Day, and issue a declaration opposing the puppet National Assembly and puppet constitution; second, to issue a circular to all organs, schools, mass organizations, etc., to fly flags at half-mast on this day every year and hold various commemorative ceremonies; third, to use various methods to conduct propaganda and education among the broad masses, and to add the content of "November 4th" National Humiliation to the textbooks of people's schools, winter schools, junior primary schools, senior primary schools, and middle schools, and to compile popular pamphlets. After an hour-long discussion, the entire committee passed the resolution by a show of hands. At this point, Jia Xinzai, a committee member from the Pingyuan group (covering Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei), speaking on behalf of the group, proposed sending a telegram to express condolences to the wise people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and to express condolences to the ever-victorious General Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all the commanders and fighters, especially the wounded and sick soldiers. The entire committee stood in silence and passed the motion, and observed three minutes of silence for the fallen martyrs, all of which were approved by the conference. Finally, it was resolved to write letters of condolence to all the cadres who have been working hard in the guerrilla areas and border areas and supporting the farmers' liberation, and to issue a circular commending the achievements of Hebei-Shandong-Henan in harnessing the Yellow River and Southern Hebei in harnessing the Wei and Fu rivers.
