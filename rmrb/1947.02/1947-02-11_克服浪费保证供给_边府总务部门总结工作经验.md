    Overcome Waste, Guarantee Supply
    Border Region Government General Affairs Department Summarizes Work Experience
    [Our Newspaper] In order to reduce waste and guarantee life, the General Affairs Department of the Border Region Government has recently summarized the following experiences:
    (1) Ideologically: First, there must be a determination to serve the masses. Second, we must use our brains more and deliberate deeply, such as how to organize production; how to achieve great harvests; how to save coal; what to eat in winter, what to eat in summer; how to coordinate small workshops with pig raising...etc., and come up with specific improvement measures. (2) In terms of practice: First, we must plan comprehensively, distinguishing between priorities, and avoid doing everything and accomplishing nothing. Second, we must act on things immediately and never procrastinate. Third, we should prepare early and not sharpen our swords at the last minute, for example, storing coal and grain in summer and winter to reduce the difficulty of transportation during heavy rain and snow. Storing grass after autumn…etc. Fourth, we must grasp principles and adhere to the system. Except for special problems that can be handled flexibly, general problems must not exceed the principles. The establishment of a sound and reasonable system is very necessary. (3) In terms of organizational leadership: First, make everyone use their talents to the fullest, clarify the division of labor, and arrange tasks specifically for the purpose of inspection. For all those being led, we should adopt the method of more rewards and less criticism to improve work morale. (Pei Zhi)

    克服浪费保证供给
    边府总务部门总结工作经验
    【本报讯】边府总务部门为减少浪费，保证生活，近总结出如下几点经验：
    （一）在思想上：第一必须有为群众服务的决心。第二要多用脑筋，深思熟虑，如生产怎样组织；怎样收获大，煤炭怎样能省，冬天吃啥饭，夏天吃啥饭，小作坊如何与养猪配合……等，都想出具体的改进办法来。（二）在作法上：第一要全面计划，分开轻重缓急，避免啥也做，啥也做不成。第二要有事就作，千万不要推拖。第三应及早准备，不要临阵磨刀，例如夏冬两季屯煤屯粮减少大雨大雪运输困难。秋后屯草…………等等。第四要掌握原则、坚持制度，除特殊问题机动处理外；一般问题不得超过原则。健全合理制度的订定是很必要的。（三）在组织领导上：第一使每一个人都是人尽其材，明确分工，布置具体，以便检查。对一切被领导的人员，应采取多奖励、少批评的办法，提高工作情绪。（培智）
