    Introducing Some Small Experiences in Supporting and Loving the People
    Zhang Liyun
    Last year, the Military and Political University did a relatively good job in supporting and loving the people in the Lucheng New District. I would like to introduce a few small experiences for reference by various agencies and troops.
    I. Discipline Inspection
    Checking discipline is a key focus of the work of supporting and loving the people, but there are often many concerns about this point among the troops and the masses. The former are concerned that if problems are found, they will have to pay compensation and be punished, and the higher-ups will have a bad impression of them; the latter are concerned that if they speak out, the army will retaliate, and even if they do, they may not be compensated, but instead harm harmony. Poor peasants have just turned over and are endlessly grateful to the Eighth Route Army, so they are unwilling to raise discipline issues. Therefore, discipline inspection should not be regarded as a purely technical task, but the reasoning should be explained to the troops and the masses. The Second Battalion of Officers of the Military and Political University put forward the slogan at a mass meeting: "One suggestion to the army is better than ten catties of pork as comfort," and as a result, the masses reflected many discipline problems. The inspection is divided into two methods: internal is registering borrowed items. Hold a forum on discipline issues and conduct ideological reflection. Experience has shown that relying solely on the first two methods does not fully expose the problems, and many of the most serious and hidden problems can only be identified during ideological reflection. External is the troop's civil affairs team combining with village cadres to conduct house-to-house inspections, convene village meetings of various systems, and conduct classified inspections (such as government cadres focusing on checking errands and borrowed items), send civil affairs teams to inspect outside villages, or conduct repeated inspections by civil affairs teams, village cadres, and troop cadres in succession. Only through such internal and external coordination of inspections can discipline problems be clarified. Sometimes, after a preliminary inspection, immediate compensation can also inspire the masses to reflect on more problems.
    II. Convening a Support-the-People's-Army Conference and Public Compensation
    After the discipline inspection is completed, it is necessary to convene a support-the-people's-army conference to conduct support-the-people's-army reflection and compensation work. First, troop cadres, owners, and village cadres should jointly hold a compensation evaluation meeting to explain the significance of compensation and discuss compensation methods. Then, a special military-civilian conference is convened. Comrades in the troops who have committed serious disciplinary violations must reflect in front of the masses, compile statistics on the facts of the masses supporting the army and read them out publicly, express gratitude on the spot to the villagers who have done a good job in supporting the army, and tell their facts of supporting the army on the spot. At this time, the masses also scrambled to pull the comrades in the troops out of the ranks and tell everyone how this comrade helped himself, and even some villagers embraced the comrades in the troops and were so moved that they could not speak.
    In addition, compensation is carried out. The slogans "Compensate for what is damaged" and "All disciplinary issues should be handled publicly at the conference as much as possible" were put forward. Pots, bowls, ladles, spoons, cups, plates, baskets, and other items to be compensated to the masses were purchased in advance, carried to the venue and displayed, and labeled with the owner's name. If no items were compensated, the items were converted into grain or money and carried to the venue. This method of compensation made a deep impression on the military and civilians, and the masses were greatly moved, breaking the rumors spread by special agents: "Investigation will not result in compensation, the Eighth Route Army only knows how to talk." When compensating, the comrades who damaged the items took the items to be compensated, found the owner on the spot to apologize, and the villagers, after receiving education on supporting the army, often refused and told the many benefits of the army in public. In this way, a lively scene of mutual praise and encouragement between the military and civilians will be formed at the venue.
    For some things that cannot be compensated at the venue, on-site compensation is implemented. Each team carries the items to be compensated, carrying, holding, and carrying them, followed by a team, beating gongs and drums, and shouting slogans, going to each house to compensate. Every time they arrive at a house, adults and children come out to greet them, tearfully telling about their life after turning over and the sincerity of not asking the Eighth Route Army to compensate. The troops then launched a campaign to love the people, once again forming a scene of mutual praise and encouragement. After putting down the compensated items, they beat gongs and drums and went to another house. This scene of compensation moved the comrades in the troops and the villagers, giving people a deep impression that can never be forgotten.
    III. Ideological Education
    The central link of supporting and loving the people is the issue of ideological education. At that time, the higher authorities stipulated: "Support-the-people's-army education is an integral part of pre-course education, and the central requirement is to clarify the idea of serving the people." Organize comrades from peasant class backgrounds to conduct grievance telling, and organize comrades from landlord backgrounds to report on the process of political awakening and the tragic state of exploitation and oppression of peasants by their families. Improved the class consciousness of the students. Solved ideological problems such as "Who exploits whom, who oppresses whom," "Whom should we serve?" "What is the difference between the Eighth Route Army and the Kuomintang army?" and cleared up some incorrect understandings of the support-the-people's-army movement. Then enter reflection, starting with the understanding of the people, and then talking about where they have failed the people (such as beating and scolding the masses), and further guide them to reflect on many hidden facts. After reflection, analyze and criticize from the bottom up, from oneself to the class, pointing out the roots of these thoughts and actions.
    Among the captured officers, the method of cadre demonstration and typical promotion was used, and great results were also achieved, and the "military-first thought," "promotion and fortune thought," and "corruption and enjoyment thought" imposed on them by the Kuomintang rulers were also initially cleared.
    IV. Combining Ideological Education with Practical Action
    In the support-the-people's-army movement, ideological education is certainly very important, but it should not stop here, but should be combined with practical action. At that time, the Military and Political University proposed that helping peasants turn over is the most practical work for supporting and loving the people, and the Second Battalion helped the peasants in Anyang turn over, gaining excellent military-civilian relations. When some cadres and students were about to be transferred, the masses grabbed their clothes and blocked the road, reluctant to part.
    The method was that after the ideological education was deepened, the leadership put forward the slogan "From understanding to action" and called on everyone to do one good thing for the masses every day, and to make support-the-people's-army plans and support-the-people's-army pacts. So each class formed a labor group and assigned work to each family of the masses, proposing that every family of the villagers should not lack water, and manure should be delivered to the fields, and even pushing millstones, grinding flour, cleaning houses, moving things, painting New Year pictures, pulling carts, cutting grass, and mediating family disputes were all helped by the villagers. College students, civil servants, intellectuals... who had just come from the Kuomintang areas were also involved in this movement. This practical help to the masses not only saved manpower, but also made the masses realize that the Eighth Route Army is truly the people's army. For the students, it greatly enhanced the concept of labor and the concept of the masses.

    介绍几点拥爱小经验
    张立云
    去年军政大学在潞城新区的拥爱工作，作得比较好，有几点小经验，介绍出来供各机关部队参考。
    一、纪律检查
    检查纪律是拥爱工作的一个重点，可是这一点在部队和群众中往往有许多顾虑。前者顾虑到检查出来要自己赔偿，要受处分，上级对自己印象不好等；后者顾虑是怕说出来军队要报复，说出也不一定会赔、反而伤了和气，穷苦农民刚翻了身，对八路军感恩不尽，纪律问题不愿提。因此，不应把检查纪律当成单纯的技术工作，而应在部队和群众中说通道理。军政大学军官二大队在群众会上提出：“对军队提一个意见，胜慰劳十斤猪肉”的口号，结果群众反映出许多纪律问题。检查分内外两种方法：内部是登记借物。开纪律问题座谈会，进行思想反省。经验证明，单靠前两种方法，问题还暴露不完，到思想反省时才能把许多最严重的、最隐蔽的问题检查出来。外部是部队民运组结合村干部挨户检查，召开村中各系统会议，分类检查（如政权干部着重检查差务、借物等），派出民运组到外村检查，或由民运组、村干部和部队干部连续进行反复检查，这样内外配合检查的结果，才能把纪律问题搞清楚。有时经初步检查后，马上进行赔偿，也能启发群众反映更多的问题。
    二、召开拥爱大会与公共赔偿
    纪律检查结束后，就要召开拥爱大会，进行拥爱反省与赔偿工作，首先由部队干部、物主和村干部共同开个赔偿评议会，说明赔偿意义，讨论赔偿办法。然后专门召开军民大会，部队犯纪律严重的同志，要在群众面前进行反省，把群众拥军的事实作成统计公开宣读，对拥军好的老乡当场致谢，把他们拥军的事实当场讲述，而群众这时也抢着把部队上的同志从行列中拉出来，告诉大家这个同志怎样帮助了他自己，甚至有的老乡抱着部队同志感动得说不出话来。
    另外，就是进行赔偿。提出“损坏什么赔偿什么”、“凡属纪律问题，尽量在大会上公开处理”等口号。把要赔偿群众的锅、碗、瓢、勺、杯、盘、篮、筐等都事先买来，等到开会时担到会场上摆起来，标上物主姓名，没有赔东西的，就把东西折成粮食或钱，扛到会场。这样的赔偿法，军民印象都很深刻，群众感动很大，打破了特务分子说的：“调查了也不会赔，八路军就是会说”等谣言。进行赔偿的时候，损坏了东西的同志拿着要赔的东西，当场找到物主进行道歉，老乡因受了拥军教育，往往不要，却把军队的许多好处当众讲述一番，这样，会场上就会形成一个军民互相表扬、互相鼓励的热烈场面。
    有的东西，会场上赔不下去，就实行登门赔偿，各队把要赔的东西抬着、扛着、拿着、担着，后面队伍跟着，打着锣鼓，呼着口号，一家一家去赔。每到一家大人小孩都迎出来，感动得流着眼泪诉说自己翻身以后的生活和不叫八路军赔东西的诚意，部队则展开爱民宣传，再一次形成互相表扬鼓励的场面，把赔的东西放下后，打着锣鼓再到另一家，这样赔偿的场面，感动了部队同志和老乡，给人以永不能忘的深刻印象。
    三、思想教育
    拥爱工作中心一环是思想教育问题，当时上级规定：“拥爱教育是预科教育的一个组成部分，中心要求是明确为人民服务的思想。”组织农民阶级出身的同志进行诉苦，组织地主出身的同志作政治觉醒过程及其家庭对农民剥削压迫惨状的报告。提高了同学们的阶级自觉。解决了“谁剥削谁，谁压迫谁”，“我们应当为谁服务？”“八路军和国民党军队有什么区别？”等思想问题，并清除了对于拥爱运动的一些不正确认识。接着进入反省，从对人民的认识检查起，接着谈到什么地方对不起人民（如打骂群众等），深入一步引导到反省许多隐蔽的事实。反省之后，由下而上，从自己到班进行分析批判，指出这些思想和行动的根源。
    在俘虏军官中，运用了干部示范、典型推动的办法，也获得很大成果，把国民党统治者加于他们的“军人第一思想”、“升官发财思想”、“腐化享乐思想”等也初步作了清算。
    四、思想教育与实际行动结合
    拥爱运动中，思想教育固然很重要，但不应当停留在这里，而应与实际行动相结合来进行。当时军政大学提出帮助农民翻身是拥爱最实际的工作，第二大队帮助安阳农民翻了身，获得极良好的军民关系。一部分干部学员要调走时，群众牵衣拦道，不忍离别。
    进行的办法是在思想教育深入以后，领导上提出“由认识到行动”的口号，号召大家每天每人给群众作一件好事，订拥爱计划、拥爱公约，于是各班成立劳动小组，把各家群众都分了工，提出让老乡家家不缺水，粪土都给送到地里，以至推碾、磨面、打扫房子、搬东西、画年画、拉大车、切草，到调解家庭纠纷等都帮老乡作了。刚从国民党区域来的大学生、公务员、知识分子……也都卷入了这一运动。这样实际帮助群众，不仅节省了民力、而且使群众认识到八路军真正是人民子弟兵。对于同学来说，则大大增强了劳动观念和群众观念。
