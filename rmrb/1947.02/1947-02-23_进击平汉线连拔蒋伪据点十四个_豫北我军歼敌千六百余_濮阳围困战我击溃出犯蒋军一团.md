　　Taihang People's Liberation Army, coordinating with the operations on the Lunan and Longhai fronts, launched an offensive along the Tangyin-Qixian-Jixian line in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway from the 7th to the 13th. They captured fourteen strongholds, including Dengjia, and more than thirty pillboxes. They destroyed ten miles of railway between Qixian and Jixian, blew up five railway bridges and one military train, and collected more than 5,000 catties of electric wire. They killed or wounded 867 men from the Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd and 44th Divisions and the puppet Sun Dianying and Wang Ziquan's forces, and captured 775 men. They seized two small cannons, 71 light and heavy machine guns, 571 long and short guns, 150,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than 50 mules and horses. Zhao Qinggong, commander of the 2nd Regiment of the 5th Column of the puppet Sun Dianying's forces, led his troops to surrender voluntarily to the People's Liberation Army in a fierce battle on the 13th.
    [Delayed report from the front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, February 20th] After the Eighth Route Army recovered Neihuang, they besieged the Chiang army's 127th Brigade of the 47th Division entrenched in Puyang. On the 15th, the 315th Regiment of this brigade launched an attack and was defeated by the Liberation Army near Wanghu (west of Puyang), with over 70 killed or wounded and 150 captured. Six light and heavy machine guns, eight portable machine guns, over 80 rifles, and three small cannons and grenade launchers were seized.
