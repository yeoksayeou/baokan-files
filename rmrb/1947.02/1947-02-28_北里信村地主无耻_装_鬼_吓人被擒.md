　　Shameless Landlord of Beilixin Village Dresses Up as a "Ghost" to Scare People and Gets Captured
    [Our Newspaper, Taihang, 26th Dispatch] Landlord Han Haigui of Beilixin Village, Xiangyuan County, dressed up as a ghost to sabotage the mass movement and was exposed by the village masses a few days ago. Last month, after the government executed the village's special agent Li Jiugui by firing squad, the village heard "ghost" cries every night, especially fiercely outside the doors of liberated peasants and military dependents, causing unrest throughout the village. The mother of military dependent Han Tangchun was frightened and became ill, and many people dared not attend the people's school. Superstitious thinking grew throughout the village, and the movement declined. Cadres and militiamen knew it was a special agent's activity, so they followed the sound when the "ghost" cried and captured it. When the masses saw that it was Han Haigui, they were extremely angry and held a meeting to question him. Superstitious thinking was immediately shattered without a trace.

    装“鬼”吓人被擒
    【本报太行二十六日电】襄垣北里信村地主韩海贵装鬼破坏群运，于日前被该村群众破坏。上月政府枪决该村特务犯李久贵后，村中入夜即闻“鬼”叫，特别在翻身群众与军属门外叫的凶，致全村不安，军属韩堂春娘被吓生病，许多人不敢上民校。全村迷信思想滋长，运动消沉。干部民兵知是特务活动，即于叫时跟踪将“鬼”捕获。群众见系韩海贵，愤怒异常，开会向其质问。迷信思想立即粉碎无遗。
