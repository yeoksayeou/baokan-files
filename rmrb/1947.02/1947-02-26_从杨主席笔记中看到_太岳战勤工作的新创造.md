    Shi Zhenming's "Work Tickets" and "Incentive Work" System

    On December 20th, Chairman Yang visited Shi Zhenming, a labor hero from the Taiyue District, at Xisongshan (Shi's home) in Fushan Fancun, and had a long conversation. The following are the investigation notes on Shi Zhenming's "Work Tickets" and "Incentive Work" system:

    I. Implementing the "Work Ticket" system to resolve the contradiction between supporting the war effort and production. Shi Zhenming's United Brigade's method was that militiamen participating in the war and supporting the war effort received work tickets. Initially, it was stipulated that one day of supporting the war effort was worth ten points (one work unit), and one day of work by a mutual aid group was worth ten points. Because the work ticket was worth fewer points, the phenomenon of unwillingness to support the war effort occurred. Later, it was changed to twelve points for one day of supporting the war effort, while one day of work was still worth ten points, correcting the bias. The masses considered it very fair." Chairman Yang then added a note from another investigation: "The method of the Yanshan United Brigade is that each group uniformly registers all labor power and informs the village office of the number. When the village office assigns tasks, it uniformly distributes the number of people each group should send based on the amount of labor power in each group, giving them work tickets. Each group, based on the number of tasks assigned by the village office, divides the number of tasks by the labor power in the group to determine the number of points each laborer should contribute. Then, based on the principle of not affecting support of the war effort and production, a certain number of people are organized to go. Those who stay at home to produce do work for the families of those who go to support the war effort based on the work tickets (number of tasks to be done) they have been assigned, converting the work tickets into work points, with the surplus being compensated for by the shortfall. The settlement is made after the people supporting the war effort return."

    II. Cattle-donkey exchange work is another creation of Shi Zhenming's mutual aid united brigade. Because cattle do not support the war effort (cattle in the Taiyue area cannot carry things), while donkeys do, and there were only five donkeys in the entire village (compared to 234 cattle), the donkey tasks were too heavy. Shi Zhenming came up with the idea of cattle-donkey exchange work, stipulating that one donkey carrying eight dou of grain for sixty li was equivalent to a cow plowing one and a half mu of land for the mutual aid group. The masses considered this method fair, reflecting that if it could be earnestly implemented, they would not sell their donkeys, and the whole village planned to increase the number of donkeys by forty."

    III. Incentive Work System. In the righteous transportation, the problem of unwillingness to carry more arose (because carrying more did not earn more points). Shi Zhenming's mutual aid united brigade discussed and agreed that each person carrying four dou of grain for the mutual aid group was worth ten points (one work unit), carrying five dou was worth twelve and a half points, and each additional dou carried earned an extra two and a half points; after implementing the incentive work system, many people carried seven or eight dou, and one firewood-gathering hero even carried one shi of millet (280 jin). This saved the number of laborers needed to go out to support the war effort.

    A New Type of Stretcher Team in Yangcheng

    On the 22nd, Chairman Yang went to comfort the frontline soldiers and field hospitals of the Fourth Military Subdistrict of Taiyue, and learned in detail about a new type of stretcher team—the Yangcheng stretcher team, which brought its own cook, shoemaker, and even a propagandist. Chairman Yang recorded the experience of this stretcher team, even many details:

    During the Yuanqu campaign, the masses in the fourth and sixth districts of Yangcheng organized 350 stretchers, staying on the front lines for two days and one night. Some even only ate two meals, rescuing the wounded seven times, with four injured and one killed in action. When departing, to save manpower, they brought 84 coffins and 15,000 bombs, saving 777 people. Under fatigue, they helped the army transport spoils of war, luggage, and medicines. The Second Company of the Sixth District alone transported 4,500 jin of wheat for a certain unit. What is worth our learning and praising is that they worked with the army on the front lines to complete their tasks, shedding blood and sweat. Despite the heavy workload and difficult living conditions, their spirits remained high and they won the praise of the army. The reasons for their achievements were mainly that they implemented "the tiller owns his land," the peasants were emancipated, and it was clear that they were participating in the war, not just supporting it, to defend the fruits of emancipation. Secondly, the army took care of them in terms of living conditions and they had a sound organization.

    I. "Participating in the war, not just supporting it": After receiving the task from the district, village cadres immediately convened the masses in the winter school to mobilize them, letting everyone discuss (1) Who are we participating in the war for? And for what? (2) Do you want to live a happy life? Do you want to live a dark life? The masses felt that the army was shedding blood for us, so our sweating was nothing. They were determined to eliminate the enemy and defend the fruits of emancipation. Jiwang, Bairun, Sihou, Sucun, Yanshan, Gulong, Huanghe, Sannanpo, and other villages automatically signed up to participate, exceeding the originally assigned tasks. Cheng Youbei from Sihou village had just been emancipated and had not supported the war effort in the past due to his disability, but this time he volunteered to participate, carrying five colored signals on his back overnight on the front lines, and transported them once to a place fifteen li away. When departing, four old men from Gulong who could not go sent a jin of oil for the stretcher team to light lamps, a jin of hemp for them to make shoes, and 500 yuan for their travel expenses. Many villages (such as Dongcun) put on plays for them, led the way, and sent them off, telling them on the road, "Be hardworking and endure hardship, take good care of the wounded, complete the task, and strive to be a model!" The Taoge militiamen said on the road: "In the past, supporting the war effort meant being beaten and scolded, and we would run away whenever we had the chance. Now we are volunteering to sign up and being sent off by people, it's really delightful, we must work hard to the end, otherwise we will let down the masses who sent us off." When going up the Shili slope, everyone composed and sang songs: "Yangcheng takes the lead and everyone gathers strength, if we don't defeat the stubborn army, we won't have a good life, we want to join the army and participate in the war and make explosions, we will continue to work hard and fight with Chiang Kai-shek." When arriving at the Yuanqu front line, they sang: "Yuanqu County is settling accounts, the revenge team wants to return home, Chiang Kai-shek is a bastard, truly not born of a mother, what hatred does the common people have against you, you are afraid of the people turning over, alas! The Chinese people will never be fooled by you again." Some complained along the way.

    II. Organization and leadership of the stretcher team: Strict organization, specific division of labor, and complete equipment, they planned on the road "not to disturb the masses and not to trouble the government." Their organization was: (1) Three stretchers as a squad, elect a squad leader and deputy squad leader, and set up a cook, a total of thirteen people. (2) Three squads as a platoon, with one platoon leader and one deputy platoon leader each. The platoon leader is held by a strong village cadre, and the deputy platoon leader is elected from the militia. In addition, there are four militiamen, one cook, for a total of forty-five people. (3) Three platoons are a company, and the company leader and deputy company leader are held by strong village cadres. A good primary school teacher is appointed as the propaganda officer, one doctor, one shoemaker, and two communication soldiers, for a total of one hundred and forty-three people. (4) An administrative district team headquarters is established, with the district chief and district cadres as cadres, one carpenter, and five communication soldiers, for a total of seven people. (5) County Brigade Headquarters, a communications squad, and four mobile cadres.

    III. Attached equipment: Seven days of dry food, salt, sesame paste, cloth bags, bedding, wooden sticks, bowls, foreign pipes, cigarettes, needles and thread, hemp rope, matches, shoe nails, two people per strip of bedding, socks, dishes (general). Each stretcher carries a hemp rope, two carrying poles, each squad prepares cooking utensils, the carpenter carries nails, the shoemaker carries leather rope, and the propaganda officer carries chalk, paper, etc.

    IV. Model Deeds: Squad leader Tan Wenh虎 rushed down nine wounded soldiers in front of the bunker root under machine gun fire. Gulong Liuzhu carried colored signals on his back, his pants stained with blood, not only did he not resent it, but he told everyone he met: "This is glorious blood!"

    Some Specific Experiences in the Second Military Subdistrict

    In order to more completely solve the problems in the combination of war and production, Chairman Yang made some supplementary investigations. The following are the notes on some specific experiences of the Taiyue Second Military Subdistrict's wartime logistics work:

    (1) Strengthen the stretcher group (similar to the Yangcheng stretcher team, omitted). When the stretcher team departs, the county issues a participation certificate, which specifies the number of people, the name of the person in charge, and is brought to the troops as an introduction. When the task is completed and returned, the troops add notes on the performance and opinions in the wartime logistics, and the person in charge of the stretcher team brings it back as the basis for summarizing the merits and demerits.

    (2) After the expeditionary stretcher arrives at the front, if there is a gap, it will organize to sell labor to help the masses in the border areas with the autumn harvest. Because the expeditionary stretcher departs for a long time, affecting the autumn harvest, the village organizes rotational service and regular shifts. Another method is to organize a rolling transfer, mainly to solve the problem of some stretcher carriers who are too young to dare to approach the front line, and carry them to the rear area.

    (3) The coffins are distributed by the special district to each county in a certain number, which are prepared by the county. As for ladders, springboards, and top poles, they should be appropriately divided and manufactured and stored by small administrative districts and villages, saving a lot of transportation power and making troop operations more convenient. However, there must be scientific planning and organization work in advance.

    (4) Usually, the local area takes the county as a unit to select capable young people or adults from the militia for training, so as to help the troops scout and lead the way in wartime, reducing the phenomenon of temporary grabs, and being able to complete the task in a timely manner. For example, in a certain battle, before the enemy's artillery fire could be deployed, it was scouted clear in advance by our well-trained militia, leading the troops around to the artillery position and capturing the artillery.

　　从杨主席笔记中看到
    太岳战勤工作的新创造
    展潮
    石振明的“差票”与“奖工”制
    十二月二十日，杨主席访问太岳区劳动英雄石振明于浮山范村之西松山（石家），畅谈竟日。下面便是关于石振明的“差票”与“奖工”制的调查笔记：
    一、实行“差票”制，解决支差与生产的矛盾。石振明联合大队的办法是民兵参战与支差得差票，开头规定出一天差顶十分（一个工），互助组干一天活顶十分，因差票顶分少，发生不愿支差现象，后来又改为支一天差顶十二分，做一天活仍顶十分，纠正了偏向，群众认为很公道。”接着杨主席又补记上他另一次调查：盐山联合大队的办法是，各组统一登记所有劳力，将数目告知村公所，村公所派差时依据各组劳力多寡统一分配各组应出差人数给以差票，各组根据村公所给差数，以组内劳力分除得出每个劳力应支差的分数，然后依不影响支差与生产原则，组织一定人数出差。留在家里生产的人，根据自己分得差票（应出差数）给出差人家做活，把差票顶成工票，长余短补，等出差人回来再行结算。”
    二、牛驴变工是石振明互助联合大队的又一创造，因为牛不支差（太岳区牛不能驮东西），驴支差，全村只有五头驴（牛二百三十四头），驴差太重，石振明即想出了牛驴变工办法，规定驴一头驮八斗粮行六十里地，互助组里的牛给犁一亩半地。群众认为这个办法公道，反映如果能认真实行，就不卖驴，全村还计划要增加四十头驴。”
    三、奖工制。在义运中发生不愿多挑的毛病（因挑多也不顶分），石振明的互助联合大队，就讨论商定每人担四斗粮，互助组里顶十分（一个工），担五斗即顶十二分五，每多担一斗多顶二分五厘工；实行奖工制后，有好多人担七、八斗，个别的有一位打柴英雄担一石小米（二百八十斤）的，这样就节省了出去支差的劳动力数量。
  阳城一个新式的担架队
    二十二日，杨主席去慰劳太岳四分区前线将士及野战医院，详细了解一个新式的担架队——自带伙夫鞋匠，还有宣传员的阳城担架队。杨主席把这个担架队的经验，甚至许许多多细节都记录下来：
    阳城四、六区群众在垣曲战役中，组织担架三百五十付，在火线上两天一夜，有的甚至只吃两顿饭，抢运伤员七次，负伤四人，阵亡一人。出发时为节省民力，捎带棺材八十四付，炸弹一万五千个，节省民力七百七十七人，在疲劳下帮助军队运胜利品行李药品，单只六区二中队给某部运麦四千五百斤。值得我们学习与表扬的是：在火线上与军队分工完成任务，又流血又流汗，繁重、生活艰苦，但精神始终饱满，获得军队称赞。其成绩获得的原因，主要是实行了劳者为其田，农民翻了身，明确是参战不是支差，是保卫翻身果实。其次是军队在生活上对他们的照顾与有健全的组织。
    一、“参战不是支差”：村干部接到区给任务，即召集群众在冬学中动员，让大家讨论（一）参战是为谁？为了什么？（二）愿过幸福日子？愿过黑暗日子？群众感到军队流血为咱们，咱流汗不算啥，坚决消灭敌人保卫果实，吉汪、白润、四候、苏村、岩山、固龙、黄河、三南坡等村，自动报名参加的人超出原分到的任务。四候村程又北才翻身，过去因残废就不支差，这次自愿参加，在火线上一夜背下五个彩号，又往十五里远的地方运送了一次。出发时，固龙有四个老汉不能去，送了一斤油给担架队点灯，麻一斤叫他们钉鞋，钱五百元给他们做盘费，有好多村（如董村）给他们演剧、带路和欢送，并告诉他们在路上，“要吃苦耐劳，爱护伤员，完成任务，争取模范！”桃河民兵在路上说：“过去支差受打挨骂，抽空就跑，现在是自动报名，受人欢送，真是痛快，一定要努力干到底，不然就对不起群众们的欢送。”上十里坡时大家就编歌子唱：“阳城在先齐鼓起劲，不打退顽军日月过不成，要参军要参战爆炸搞现成，再接再厉和蒋军拚。”到垣曲火线上又唱：“垣曲县倒算账，复仇队要还乡，蒋介石王八蛋，真不是娘生，老百姓与你何仇恨，你怕人民翻身当那桩，唉！中国人民绝不会再上你的当。”有的在路上就诉起苦来。
    二、担架队的组织领导：严密组织具体分工，并带用具齐备，他们计划在路上“不打扰群众不麻烦政府”。他们的编制是：（一）三副担架为一班，选正副班长，设一炊事员，共十三人。（二）三班为一分队，正副队长各一人，正队长由强村干部担任，副队长由民兵中选举，另配民兵四人，炊事员一人，共四十五人。（三）三个分队为一中队，正副队长由强村干部担任，好小学教员任宣干，医生一人，鞋匠一人，通讯员二人，共一百四十三人。（四）以行政设一区队部，由区长区干部任干部，木匠一人，通讯员五人，共七人。（五）县大队部，通讯班一个、机动干部四人。
    三、附带用具：干粮七天，盐、芝麻面、布袋、被单、木棍、碗、洋烟筒、烟、针线、麻绳、火柴、鞋钉、两个人一条被、穿袜、菜品（一般的）。每付担架带麻绳一条，扁担两根，每班备做饭工具，木匠带钉，鞋匠带皮绳，宣干带粉笔纸等。
    四、模范事迹：分队长谭文虎在机枪射击下，到碉堡根前抢下九个伤兵。固龙留柱背彩号，裤上染上血，不但不怨恨，反而见人就说：“这是光荣血！”
  二分区的几点具体经验
    为了更完满的解决战争与生产结合中的问题，杨主席又作了一些补充调查。下面是他笔记的关于太岳二分区战勤工作的几点具体经验：
    （一）加强担架组（与阳城担架队相彷，从略）。担架队出发时，由县发给参战证，上面写明人数，负责人姓名，带交部队作介绍，任务完毕返回时，由部队添注在战勤中表现及意见，交担架队负责人带回，作为总结成绩优劣的依据。
    （二）远征担架出到前方后，如有空隙就组织卖工，帮助边沿区群众秋收。因远征担架出发时间较长影响秋收，村里组织轮流服务，定期换班。另一种办法是组织轮着倒送，主要解决一部分担小不敢接近火线的人，在靠近后方倒运。
    （三）棺材由专区分配各县一定数目，由县准备，至于梯子、跳板、顶杆等是要以小行政区村为单位适当分工制造保存，节省大量的转运力量，且使部队行动更加方便，但事先须要有科学的计划与组织工作。
    （四）平时地方以县为单位，从民兵中挑选精干青年或壮年加以训练，以便战时帮助部队侦察带路，减少临时抓的现象，又能及时完成任务。如在某次战斗中，敌人炮火尚未施展，即被我方早已训练好的民兵事前侦察清楚，带领部队绕到炮位，将炮夺过来啦。
