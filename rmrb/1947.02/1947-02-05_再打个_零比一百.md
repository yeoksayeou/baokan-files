　　Let's Score Another "Zero to One Hundred"
　　Lǚ Liáng
　　The newspaper carrying the *Liberation Daily* short commentary "Learn from the Shouyang Local Troops" had just arrived at the Shouyang Independent Battalion headquarters when the excited words "Chairman Mao is praising us!" spread throughout all the squads. After reading it aloud in front, the newspaper was passed around among the commanders and fighters who had personally created the glorious achievement of "Zero to Seventy," from the battalion to the company, from one squad grabbing it from another. The illiterate soldiers clamored for others to read it to them; everyone felt honored and happy.
　　To create even greater victories, the deputy battalion commander and deputy political commissar were constantly studying how to fight the enemy, aiming to achieve a "Zero to One Hundred." Cadres would say to each other upon meeting. The squads were filled with the heat of battle and the sound of bayonet charge drills. From the beginning of December, in order to improve skills and eliminate more enemies, half a month of military training was conducted. After it ended, everyone saw that the New Year was approaching, but they all resolutely demanded: "Eliminate two enemy forces and celebrate the New Year, as an answer to the higher-ups and Chairman Mao." The platoon leaders went to the railway two days earlier to "figure out the pattern," and after getting accurate information, they immediately sent a messenger back. Still afraid it wasn't reliable enough, Wang Wanyou, the third platoon leader of Company ×, rushed back again at night to lead the team to attack.
　　The enemy was terrified of the Shouyang Independent Battalion! Seeing troops in military uniforms, they would turn and run, so they changed into various civilian clothes, looking for opportunities to attack. The troops ambushed on the ridge above the train, but the enemy didn't come out, so they had about a dozen militiamen cooperating in the operation go down to the blockhouse by the railway to "invite" and lure the enemy. But the enemy remained hidden in their tortoise shell. The third time the militiamen went down to the blockhouse, one of them deliberately shouted loudly: "My gun is jammed, I can't shoot anymore," and turned to run back, which finally "invited" the enemy out, led by a Japanese instructor and a platoon leader, carrying machine guns and small cannons, chasing after them. The ambushing squad deliberately exposed themselves and fired a volley, leading the enemy into the ambush circle. "Let's get a few machine guns to celebrate the New Year!" The words had just been spoken when the enemy, carrying machine guns, was close. The soldiers pounced on them like a pack of tigers, seizing all three machine guns the enemy had brought.
　　At the New Year's dinner, everyone happily sang the song "The Battalion's Battle Blooms," praising their achievements throughout the year. The twenty-three enemy-killing heroes elected by the entire battalion led everyone in formulating their merit-earning plans for the year. After visiting their achievements throughout the year: ninety-five rifles, nine machine guns, six small cannons, and a large pile of binoculars, pistols, raincoats, coats, etc., everyone was extremely excited. On January 6th, the Yan puppet army launched a "Great Flood," sending over 5,000 people, attempting to eliminate this "pain in their side," but the enemy's vicious plot was crushed. The enemy also plotted to sabotage and disintegrate the troops, capturing and torturing the soldiers' families, threatening the soldiers to go home, but not a single "coward" appeared in the Independent Battalion. Before the enemy's attack, the soldiers who had asked for leave to go home sneaked back to the troops through the enemy's encirclement; the troops were not short of a single person. They said: "We are a team praised by Chairman Mao; we must continue to create glorious achievements."

### 再打个“零比一百”

　　再打个“零比一百”
    吕梁
    载着解放日报短论《向寿阳地方部队看齐》的那张报刚到寿阳独立营营部，“毛主席表扬咱们啦！”兴奋的话语就传遍了各班。在前宣读以后，报纸在那些亲自创造“零比七十”光辉战绩的指战员手里传着，从营传到连，从这班抢到那班。不识字的战士，吵着要旁人念给听，大家都感到光荣和愉快。
    为创造更大战绩，副营长和副政委，整天在研究怎样打敌人，并要打个“零比一百”，干部们见面就说。班里到处充满着战斗的热气和刺枪冲锋的演习声。从十二月上旬起，为了提高技术，更多的消灭敌人，进行了半个月的练兵，结束后，眼看快过年了，但是他们都坚决要求：“消灭两股敌人过年，回答上级和毛主席。”排长们早两天就到铁道上去“摸规律”，得到准确情况，立刻送信回来。还怕靠不住，×连三排长王万有又黑夜赶回来引队伍去打。
    敌人被寿阳独立营打怕了！看见穿军衣的队伍扭头就跑，他们又换了各色便衣，找机会袭击敌人，队伍埋伏到车过岭上，可是敌人不出来，他们就让配合作战的十来个民兵，下到铁路边炮楼跟前去“请”，迷惑引诱敌人，但敌人还是缩在乌龟壳里不动。第三次民兵下到炮楼跟前，有一个故意大声叫：“枪卡了壳，不能打啦”，扭头往回跑，这才把敌人“请”了出来，由日本教官和一个排长带着。扛着机枪小炮，追过来了。埋伏着的那个班，又故意暴露自己，打了一排枪，把敌人引进伏击圈。“闹几挺机枪过过年！”话刚落音，敌人扛着机枪已到了近前，战士们像一窝老虎似的猛扑过去，把敌人带来的三挺机枪，一下都夺过来了。
    在新年会餐席上，大家欢愉地唱着歌颂自己全年战绩的“营兵打的莲花开”的歌。全营选举的二十三名杀敌英雄，领导大家纷纷订了今年的立功计划。参观了自己全年的战绩：九十五枝步枪，九挺机枪，六门小炮和一大堆望远镜，手枪、雨水、大衣等，大家都兴奋无比。一月六日，阎伪军发动了五千多人的“大水漫”，企图消灭这个“腹中大患”，但敌人的毒谋被击溃了；敌人又阴谋破坏瓦解，把战士家属捉去拷打恐吓，威胁战士回家，但独立营没出现一个“孬种”。在敌人进攻前，请假回家的战士，偷过敌人包围又回到了部队，部队一个人也不短。他们说：“咱们是毛主席表扬过的队伍，一定要继续创造光荣战绩。”
