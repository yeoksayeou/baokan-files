Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th. The Yan army's brutal execution of seventeen-year-old rural female Communist Party member Liu Hulan at the same time and place, along with six kind civilians, has aroused great indignation among the people of Wenshui. On January 12th, when the 72nd Division, 215th Regiment of the Yan army surrounded Yunzhou Village in the fifth district of Wenshui County, they ordered the villagers to hold a meeting. They immediately tied up the young woman Liu Hulan and farmers Shi Anlin, Chen Guizi, and five others, and immediately subjected them to fists and kicks, and all kinds of insults, forcing them to confess. Liu Hulan answered with her head held high: "I am a Communist Party member, and I will never surrender!" (See this newspaper on the 9th.) and calmly faced death under the guillotine. The other six also died under torture with the great righteous spirit of the Chinese people. Among the dead, two were elderly men in their seventies, all of whom were patriotic people who had fought bravely against the Japanese invaders for a long time. When they were guillotined, their family members and villagers who were forced to watch the execution cried out in unison. This extremely cruel killing of the people also occurred the next day (13th) in Yuele Village, ten li from Wenshui City. On that day, the Yan army, according to a pre-made list, used iron shovels to kill on the spot the village deputy, Yan chief, and seventeen villagers.
