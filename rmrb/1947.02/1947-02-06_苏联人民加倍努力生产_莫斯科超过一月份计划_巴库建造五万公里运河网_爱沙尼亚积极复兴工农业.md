    [This article is transmitted by TASS] Moscow, February 3rd: Millions of Soviet people are celebrating the elections of the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics with redoubled efforts. Moscow's industry has exceeded its January production plan, and factory workers are guaranteeing to complete the first three months of the year's plan ahead of schedule. The January production plan has already been completed ahead of schedule in Leningrad, Gorky, Kiev, and other Soviet industrial centers.
    [Another dispatch] Five large iron smelting furnaces will be established in Soviet steel factories this year, as many as were built in the entire pre-war period. The first of these will begin operation in February. In accordance with the decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers on accelerating the development of light industry, the scope of capital construction for light industry in the capital in 1947 will be twice that of last year. Most of the sixty new enterprises to be constructed under the Five-Year Plan will be completed this year or in early 1948. Among the newly established factories will be many weaving mills, clothing factories, footwear and hosiery factories, tanneries, and glass factories. This year, the production of footwear and hosiery will increase by 44% compared to last year, and woven goods will increase by 55%.
    [Another dispatch] A huge construction plan is underway in Baku, with deep canals being dug to the level of the sea's saltwater tide, after which the land will be irrigated with fresh water. An irrigation canal network is being built here simultaneously. A total of 50,000 kilometers of canals have already been built on the grasslands. As a result, collective farms and state farms in Azerbaijan will obtain hundreds of thousands of hectares of fertile land.
    [This article is transmitted by TASS] Moscow, February 3rd: The Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic recently published an article in *Pravda*, stating that the Estonian people are rebuilding their country to achieve new levels, and other sectors of the national economy are also developing. Estonian factories are producing more pulp, wood pulp, and paper, and grain production is progressing rapidly. The output of factories under the Republic's local industry department has increased by 65%, and thousands of Stakhanovite workers have emerged. Forty-eight thousand farm households have received land from the Soviet government for the first time, and twenty-five machine and tractor stations are working in Estonia.
