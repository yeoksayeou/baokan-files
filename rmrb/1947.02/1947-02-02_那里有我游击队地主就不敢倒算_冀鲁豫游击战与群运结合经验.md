(From Our Correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 30th) In Juancheng, the enemy occupied the area for twenty days, but our guerrillas frequently operated on the fringes. Only a few landlords demanded grain and land back from the peasants, and there were even fewer killings. In Yuncheng, the enemy occupied the area for forty days. In eastern Yuncheng, where our guerrilla activities started earlier, only a few of the most "stubborn" villages (Guan Tun) saw landlords kill two activists from the peasant association. We executed one of the worst "Homecoming Legions" members and arrested several collaborators. After educating them, we released them. From then on, the landlords dared not kill peasants or demand grain and land back. Some landlords who were about to demand land and grain back stopped when they saw our activities. In southern Yuncheng, where our guerrilla activities started later, landlords killed nineteen peasants, and some landlords also demanded grain back but had not yet demanded land back. In Yunju, the enemy occupied the area for twenty days before we began activities. Landlords universally demanded grain back and killed dozens of peasants. However, the landlords were still very afraid, demanding grain and land back during the day but not daring to stay at home at night. The peasants, under duress, temporarily endured, waiting for the Eighth Route Army to arrive and seek revenge. To sum up the above situations, in the occupied areas, wherever our guerrillas entered early, landlords not only did not demand grain, land, or kill people, but some even returned the grain they had taken from peasants. We could even win over some landlords to oppose the atrocities of the Chiang army with us. Wherever our guerrillas dared not enter or entered late, more peasants were killed, resulting in the greatest losses. This has increased the difficulty of re-launching guerrilla warfare in the northern Hebei region. From this, we can see that the main struggle in the Chiang-occupied areas is the peasants' opposition to landlords demanding grain and land back and killing people, while also uniting people from all walks of life to oppose the Chiang army's grain requisitioning, conscription, rape, arson, and murder. Therefore, in areas preparing for guerrilla warfare and those already launching it, we must clearly put forward the slogan of "Protect Land, Protect Grain, Protect Lives." Regarding opposing retribution and thoroughly distributing land as the central content of guerrilla warfare, we must publicly announce to landlords and peasants that implementing "land to the tiller" is the law, and that landlords demanding grain and land back is illegal behavior, and those who kill must pay with their lives. We must resolutely suppress individual key bad landlords, firmly win over secondary ones, and resolutely support the basic masses, protecting the land they have already obtained. While preserving the peasants' acquired land, we must unite with landlords to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. Guerrilla teams in Chiang-occupied areas should strive to launch operations in a timely manner and not delay, as it will become increasingly difficult. If we enter in a timely manner, the "Homecoming Legions" and landlords will fear us, the masses will rely on us, and mass guerrilla warfare can be quickly and victoriously launched.

　　那里有我游击队地主就不敢倒算
    冀鲁豫游击战与群运结合经验
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】鄄城敌人占了二十天，我游击队常至边沿活动，地主只有个别向农民倒粮倒地，杀人更少。郓城敌人占了四十天，郓东我游击活动较早，只个别最“顽固”的村子（官屯），地主杀了两个农会积极分子。我们将“还乡团”的一个最坏的杀了；将几个胁从分子逮捕，经过教育后释放了。从此地主再不敢杀农民、倒粮、倒地了。有些地主正在要倒地倒粮，看见我们的活动都停止了。郓南我们游击活动较晚、地主杀死农民十九个人，一部分地主也倒了粮，还未倒地，郓巨敌人占了二十天我们才进去活动，地主普遍倒粮，杀了农民几十个人，但地主仍很害怕，白天倒粮倒地，夜间不敢在家，农民在不得已的情况下，就暂时忍着，等待八路军到时再报仇。总括以上情况，在被占区，凡是我游击队进去早的地方，地主不但不去倒粮、倒地、杀人，有的倒了粮，农民送回去，并且还能争取一部分地主与我们共同反对蒋军的暴行。凡我游击队不敢进去或进去晚的地方，农民被杀死的人多，损失最大。冀北地区给再开展游击战争增加了困难。由此可知，蒋占区的主要斗争是农民反对地主倒粮、倒地、杀人，同时联合各阶层人民反对蒋军的征粮、抓丁、奸淫和烧杀。因此在准备游击战争和正在开展游击战争的地区，必须明确提出“保地、保粮、保命”的口号。反倒算与彻底分田，作为游击战争的中心内容。我们要向地主与农民公开宣传，实行耕者有其田，地主倒粮、倒地是违法行为，杀人者偿命。对个别首要坏地主坚决镇压，次要者要坚决争取，对基本群众要坚决撑腰，保护群众既得的土地。在保存农民既得的土地情况下，联合地主反对蒋介石卖国内战，蒋占区游击队争取及时发动，不应拖延时间，越来越困难；如我进去及时，“还乡团”和地主就怕我们，群众就靠我们，群众性的游击战争就能迅速胜利的开展起来。
