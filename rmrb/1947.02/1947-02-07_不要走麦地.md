    Don't Walk on the Wheat Fields
    Comrade Editor: Recently, on the road from Nei Yang to Xingtai, which is more than 120 li long, I counted a total of 137 trampled wheat patches, totaling approximately 10.7 mu. Calculating a yield of 5 dou per mu, this amounts to a loss of 5 shi, 3 dou, and 5 sheng of wheat. If we were to calculate this for the entire Taihang area and the entire border region, the loss of wheat production would be staggering. My suggestion is to publish this issue in the newspaper to draw everyone's attention to it. People from all walks of life should avoid walking on wheat fields, and at the same time, wheat field owners should quickly block off small paths through the wheat fields. Don't wait until spring warms up to do so. This will help with this year's wheat harvest.

    不要走麦地
    编辑同志：最近我从内羊到邢台的一百二十多里长的路上，计算了一下被践踏的麦苗共一百三十七块，约计十亩七分多，按每亩收五斗计算，要损失五石三斗五升麦子。如把全太行区全边区计算起来，损失麦的产量更是惊人的。我的意见应该在报上把这问题登载出来引起大家的注意，各界人士不要走麦田，同时麦地主人赶快断绝麦地小路，不要等到春暖再断绝，这样对今年麦子的收成是有帮助的。
