　　Contact Villages and Districts Outside the Locality for Mutual Inspection
    Discussion on Land Investigation Methods at the Same Meeting
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] In the current land investigation and class investigation movement in the Third District of this county, emphasis is placed on the following points to various villages: The main goal of land investigation is still landlords. We must make every effort to investigate and clear out all the land hidden by landlords. The class investigation mainly distinguishes who are the exploiters? Who are the exploited? We must tell all the sufferings and turn ourselves inside out. Therefore, the class investigation must be combined with telling sufferings to distinguish boundaries, recognize our own people, and improve ideological awareness. After the land and class are clearly investigated, the important issue is fair distribution. This is a matter for our own family. We should help each other and be friendly. Good and bad land, near and far land, should be well adjusted. People with more land should promote their voluntary concession for adjustment, and there should be no slightest coercion. Regarding how to investigate the land, because the landlords have many tricks to hide the land, the following investigation methods were discussed at the same meeting: 1. Thoroughly demand the old contracts. In order to avoid struggle, many lands sold by landlords at low prices have excuses for losing the old contracts, writing supplementary contracts to the buyers, and some lands seized through struggle have not been given written contracts, all of which must be given the old contracts. We put forward to the masses: "Keeping the old contracts is thinking of changing the sky, not wanting to come out unwillingly." 2. Check false mortgages and false sales, check the intermediaries who say land is bought and sold to see if they are relatives or lackeys of the landlord, colluding to deceive the poor or backward masses, sheltering the landlords. Because in the investigation it was found that many landlords used such false mortgages and false sales to avoid struggle. 3. Investigate false ancestral halls and false names, take the land account and various old and new written contracts to quote each other, and the false names and false ancestral halls hidden by the landlords' clever plans can be revealed. 4. Contact and check each other with villages and districts outside the locality, compare the new and old contracts of the whole village with each other, and then compare the land plots, which will be clear.

　　联系外村外区互助检查
    同会讨论查田办法
    【本报武安讯】本县三区在当前查田查阶级运动中，着重向各村提出：查土地的主要目标还是地主，要尽一切力量把地主所有隐藏清查出来；查阶级主要是分清谁是剥削人的？谁是受剥削的？要诉尽苦、翻透身。因此查阶级中必须结合诉苦，分清界限认清自家人，提高思想觉悟。土地阶级都查清楚，重要问题就是公平分配，这是自己家里的事，应互助友爱，好坏远近要很好调剂，地多的人应发扬其自觉自动让出调剂，不能有丝毫免强。关于怎样查土地，因地主隐藏土地诡计多端，同会基点讨论出以下几种清查办法：一、彻底要老约。地主为避免斗争贱价卖出的地有不少借口老约遗失，给买主写的补约，还有些斗出的地没要出文约的，一律要出老约。向群众提出“存老约是想变天，不要出来心不甘”。二、检查假当假卖，检查买卖土地的说合人，看是否地主亲友或狗腿，互相拉手骗穷人，或落后群众包庇地主，因在清查中发现地主不少这样假当假卖以避免斗争。三、清查假堂号假人名，拿地亩账与新旧文约各方引证，地主巧计隐藏的假名假堂号即可露出。四、和外村外区互相联系，互相检查，把全村新老约相互对照，再对地块，就会查清楚。
