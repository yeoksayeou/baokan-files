　　Promoting the Exemplary Action of Cadres Relinquishing Gains
    Cadres and activists voluntarily giving up extra land and housing, distributing it to farmers who received too little land and housing, is now emerging in large numbers of models in various places.  In Jinnan and Taiyue, many cadres have done this. Zhao Chunhua, a first-class textile hero of Taihang, declined the fruits allocated to her by the masses and mobilized other cadres to give up their extra shares. This demonstrated the heroic nature of those who grew up among the masses and did not forget them, worthy of the praise of the masses.

    In our region, there are still many villages where the leveling and replenishing work has not been done well because cadres and activists occupy or receive too many gains. It is hoped that the leadership in various places will pay close attention to promoting this exemplary action. This will not only truly improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also allow cadres and activists to put down the conservative and selfish baggage that hinders their progress!

    In addition, some organs and troops, in the past, in order to carry out production, borrowed village public property or rented land from landlords and farmers. To ensure that cultivated land returns to farmers, it should all be returned to the farmers. Some county and district organs have also retained confiscated land from traitors, which should also be handed over to the local masses to ensure that on the basis of equal distribution of land, the impoverished peasants can truly obtain land.

　　推广干部退让果实的模范行动
    干部积极分子，自觉让出多分房地，分给得地得房过少的农民，现正在各地涌现大批的模范。冀南、太岳都有不少干部这样做了，太行一等纺织英雄赵春花谢绝群众分配给她的果实；并动员其他干部也将多得部分让出来，表现了从群众中生长起来而不忘群众的英雄本色，不愧群众的赞誉。
    在本区，现还有不少村庄，因干部积极分子占有或分得果实过多，致使填平补齐至今未能做好，希各地领导上切实注意推广这一模范行动。这不但可使干群关系得到真正改善，而且可使干部积极分子放下妨害自己进步的保守与自私的包袱！
    另外，有些机关部队，过去为了进行生产，曾有借用村公产或从地主与农民手中租种土地者，为保证耕地归农，应一律归还农民。个别县区机关，也有将没收汉奸土地留用者，也应交给当地群众，以保证在平均分配土地的基础上，让赤贫农真正能获得土地。
