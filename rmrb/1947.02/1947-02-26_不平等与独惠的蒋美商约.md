　　The Unequal and Preferential Sino-American Commercial Treaty
    Du Bo
    After the signing of the nation-selling and traitorous Sino-American Commercial Treaty, the propaganda organs of the Chiang government and their kept echoers shamelessly clamored that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was a "great success of Chinese diplomacy" and "the first reciprocal and equal commercial treaty between China and a foreign country since the signing of treaties with foreign countries." However, everyone with national self-esteem or a sense of justice unanimously said that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was even more shameless and ugly than the Twenty-One Demands, was "the most unequal treaty signed after the abolition of unequal treaties in China," and was "a collection of all unequal treaties in China for a hundred years."
    Indeed, on the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, the newspapers all wrote the words "friendly," "equal," and "reciprocal," and both sides had the provision of "most-favored-nation treatment." However, this so-called "equality" and "reciprocity," when signed between a country like China, which is extremely underdeveloped in industry and backward in agricultural technology, and an imperialist country like the United States, which has abundant capital and high production capacity and technology, is in reality the most unequal and preferential to the United States, no matter how beautifully worded the clauses are. This is like a strong and burly man fighting a person with extreme physical weakness, and agreeing in advance that you punch me once and I punch you once. On the surface, this naturally seems very equal; but in reality, the physically weak person is bound to suffer greatly. Even Britain, a country with fairly developed industry and commerce, would not dare to sign such an open-door treaty with the United States today. After the end of the war, Britain borrowed $4.4 billion from the United States, but after more than a year of negotiations, the United States only lent her $3.7 billion, because the United States intended to use the power of its gold standard to coerce Britain into relinquishing the "imperial preference" in its colonies, which Britain refused to do. The so-called "imperial preference" is the right of Britain to have priority in investing, establishing factories, and importing goods in its colonies, while adopting a policy of excluding goods and capital from other countries. If Britain allowed the abolition of this "preference," cheap American goods would flood into her colonies like a burst dike, completely driving out her influence. Of course, compared to China, Britain is much stronger in terms of capital, production capacity, and production technology. Britain still does not dare to sign this so-called "equal" and "reciprocal" treaty with the United States today, so how could China be worthy of it? However, the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek brazenly signed it. If the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is fully implemented, it will completely bankrupt China's fragile national industry, further deplete the impoverished countryside, turn China completely into a colony of the United States, and reduce future generations to slaves and beasts!
    Article II, Section 2 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty stipulates: "Nationals of either High Contracting Party shall be permitted to engage in and carry on, within the entire territory of the other High Contracting Party, business, manufacturing, processing, finance, science, education, religion, and charitable activities, which are not prohibited by the laws and regulations enforced by legally constituted officials." Article III, Section 3 stipulates: "The High Contracting Parties shall, for the purposes of commerce, manufacturing, processing, finance, science, education, religion and charity, acquire, hold, construct or lease and occupy suitable buildings, and lease suitable land, ... to engage in any matter occasionally needed or necessary for enjoying any such rights and privileges, without interference." On the surface, it seems full of the spirit of equality and reciprocity, but we must not be deceived by the superficial words, and must examine the actual effects that the treaty can have. As is well known, the United States has plenty of capital, plenty of cheap and high-quality goods, and plenty of merchant ships weighing 100,000 tons. Of course, they can come to China to do business according to the "equal" spirit of this commercial treaty, massively dump their goods in our coastal and inland areas, and can export capital, establish stores in our country, purchase raw materials, open factories, and do whatever business they want, doing whatever they want. But what about us? Does our China have capital to export to the United States to establish stores, purchase raw materials, and open factories? Do we have goods to "dump" in the United States? Do we have ships to cross the vast Pacific Ocean to do business? Regarding these questions, there can obviously only be negative answers. According to official materials from the Chiang government, from January to September last year, the value of our imported goods was 99.75 billion yuan, of which imports from the United States accounted for 57.53 billion yuan, accounting for 58 percent of the total value of imported goods. American goods filled all the large and small cities and villages in the KMT-controlled areas. In places like Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, American gasoline was cheaper than boiled water. The low price of American milk caused even fried dough sticks and sesame seed cake vendors to lose their jobs. As for our national industry, from last autumn to the Lunar New Year, more than 27,000 companies closed down one after another, causing a large number of workers to lose their jobs, wander the streets, cry for food and warmth, and have no way to make a living. After the implementation of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, this phenomenon will only become more serious. These are the things that the Sino-American Commercial Treaty "reciprocates" to the Chinese people!
    Article XVI, Section 3 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty stipulates: "Neither High Contracting Party shall impose any prohibition or restriction on the importation, sale, distribution or use of any plant, product or manufacture of the other High Contracting Party, or on the export of any article to the territory of the other High Contracting Party." On the surface, it seems very fair, because American agricultural products can be freely transported to our China for sale, and our Chinese agricultural products can also be transported to the United States. China is an agricultural country, and the United States is an industrial country, so we should be able to transport a large number of agricultural products to the United States for sale, right? But the actual situation is not like this. Apart from the problem of transportation ships, according to the national laws of the United States, all goods transported to the United States must be allowed by the American consul in the port of export before they can be loaded. In other words, if we want to transport goods to the United States, we must first ask the American consulate to inspect and approve them, otherwise the United States will not allow imports. There is no "freedom" of "trade" at all. Furthermore, although China is an agricultural country, its production methods and production technology are backward, and its costs are high. The price is also high; although the United States is an industrial country, its agricultural production uses machines, the output is abundant, and the costs are low, and the price is also low. In addition, it has convenient conditions such as ship transportation, and China cannot compete with the United States in any case. According to official statistics from the Chiang government, from January to September last year, among the 99.75 billion yuan worth of goods imported by our country, cotton and cotton textiles accounted for 28.66 billion yuan, of which imports from the United States reached 11.4 billion yuan; fruits and vegetables accounted for 139 million yuan, of which imports from the United States reached 97 million yuan; miscellaneous grains and miscellaneous grain flour accounted for 168 million yuan, of which imports from the United States reached 40 million yuan; tobacco accounted for 262 million yuan, of which imports from the United States reached 255 million yuan; wood accounted for 87 million yuan, of which imports from the United States reached 55 million yuan. Even these agricultural products are being dumped by the United States, so of course China has no major or large agricultural products that can be transported to the United States for sale. The future of our rural areas, which have been ravaged and depleted by the Chiang family's conscription and grain shops, is truly unimaginable under the impact and threat of American agricultural product dumping!
    The above are just two examples, and this essence and spirit of inequality and preference permeates every clause of the entire Sino-American Commercial Treaty.
    Then, is the language of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty completely "equal" and "reciprocal"? No! Even in the language, there are still provisions that are unequal and preferential to the United States.
    Article II, Section 4 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty stipulates: "Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed to affect the laws and regulations of either High Contracting Party relating to immigration, or the right to enact laws and regulations relating to immigration." This means that Americans can enter China as long as they have a certificate issued by the American authorities, and reside and travel throughout China, engaging in business, manufacturing, processing, finance, science, education, religion, and charitable activities, and the Chinese government cannot interfere; but Chinese people entering the United States are still subject to the restrictions of the American "immigration law." What is the "immigration law"? This is a law unique to the United States that specifically prohibits and restricts people from other countries from entering the United States. According to this "immigration law," all colored people were previously on the list of "prohibited immigrants." White people going to the United States are also divided into two categories: the first category is called "free immigrants," limited to Anglo-Saxons (i.e., British); the second category is called "quota immigrants," which limits the number of people entering each year, with specific regulations for each country. The United States' laws prohibiting Chinese immigration originated in 1882, and were revised in 1917 and 1924. Now, the treatment of Chinese people is handled according to the second category of "quota immigrants," with an annual quota of 104 people, and they must also undergo medical examinations and go through various complicated procedures to obtain passports from the American consulate. Also, the United States not only has national "immigration laws," but its 48 states also have local "immigration regulations," and there are various troubles and restrictions when going from one state to another. Since the freedom of Chinese people to enter the United States has been completely deprived, the so-called residence, commerce, manufacturing, processing, etc., become nothing but flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water.
    Regarding the provisions for purchasing real estate: If any state, territory, or possession of the United States does not allow Chinese people to enjoy the same rights as American people to purchase real estate, then the provisions of China to the United States may not be applicable. (Article VIII, Section 1) Article XXVI, Section 4 stipulates: The preferential treatment given by the United States and its territories or possessions or the Panama Canal Zone to Cuba or the Philippines shall not apply. The former means that Americans can purchase any real estate in China without any restrictions, but if any state in the United States now or in the future has regulations restricting Chinese people from purchasing real estate, China may not need to give American nationals residing in that state rights superior to those given to Chinese nationals by that state. The latter means that although China and the United States have "most-favored-nation treatment," that is, each party gives the other "no less favorable treatment than it gives now or in the future to any third country," the preferential treatment given by the United States to Cuba and the Philippines cannot be cited as an example by China. May I ask: Where in ancient and modern China and foreign countries is there such "equality" and "reciprocity"? !
    The facts are as clear as a blazing fire. The beautiful and glittering words in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty are entirely for deceiving the Chinese people and covering up the crimes and misdeeds of the Chiang traitor in selling the country. But the eyes of the Chinese people are sharp and bright, and they have never recognized any nation-selling and humiliating treaties signed by any dictator and traitor. Of course, they will not recognize the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, the culmination of the most unequal and most shameful treaties selling out the country. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, representing the interests and will of the Chinese people, has recently issued a solemn statement that it will not recognize all foreign loans and all humiliating and country-selling treaties concluded independently by the Chiang Kai-shek government after January 10, 1946, and will never assume any obligations. There is no doubt that, under this just and solemn announcement, the entire Chinese people will launch a more resolute struggle for the abolition of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, for national independence, and against American imperialism and its running dogs.

　　不平等与独惠的蒋美商约
    杜波
    丧权卖国的蒋美商约签订之后，蒋政府的宣传机关及其豢养的应声虫们，便无耻的喧嚷着，蒋美商约是“中国外交的伟大成功”，是“中国和外国签订条约以来第一次的互惠平等商约”。但是，一切具有民族自尊心或正义感的人，无不异口同声的说，蒋美商约比二十一条件还要无耻与丑恶，是中国“不平等条约废除以后，第一次签订的最不平等的条约”，是“集中国百年来不平等条约的大成”。
    诚然，在蒋美商约上，报纸都写着“好友”、“平等”、“互惠”的字样，双方都有“最惠国待遇”的规定。但是，这种所谓“平等”、“互惠”，以中国这样工业极不发达，农业技术也很落后的国家，与美国那样资本雄厚，生产能力和生产技术都很高的帝国主义国家来签订，无论词句写的如何美妙动人，实际上是最不平等和独惠于美国的。这如同一个身强力壮彪形大汉，与一个身体极端衰弱的人角斗，事先相互约定，你打我一拳，我也打你一拳，表面上看来这自然是很平等了；但实际上，身体衰弱的人是一定要大大吃亏的。像这种开门揖盗的商约，就是工商业颇为发达的英国，今天也不敢和美国签订。战争结束以后，英国曾向美国商借四十四万万美元，但谈判年余，美国才贷给了她三十七万万美元，原因是美国图借金元的力量要挟英国，要她让出在其殖民地的“帝国优先权”，而英国却不答应。所谓“帝国优先权”，就是英国在其所属各殖民地国家中，有优先投资、设厂和输入商品的权利，而对其他国家的商品和资本采取排斥的政策。如果英国允许取消这种“优先权”，价廉的美货便会像决堤的洪水一样滚滚流入她的殖民地，把她的势力完全驱逐出去。当然，英国比起中国来，无论就资本或生产能力、生产技术上讲，都比中国强多了，英国今天尚且不敢和美国订立这种所谓“平等”、“互惠”的条约，中国又怎么配？可是，民贼独夫蒋介石却竟悍然签订了。蒋美商约如果全部实现起来，将会使中国脆弱的民族工业完全破产，凋敝的农村更加枯竭，使中国完全变成美国的殖民地，子子孙孙沦为奴隶牛马！
    蒋美商约第二条第二款规定：“缔约此方之国民，在缔约彼方领土全境内，应许其不受干涉从事并经营，依法组织之官员所施行之法律规章所不禁止之商务、制造、加工、金融、科学、教育、宗教及慈善事业”。第三条第三款规定：“缔约双方…………为商务、制造、加工、金融、科学、教育、宗教及慈善之目的，而取得保有建造或租赁及占有适当之房屋，并租赁适当之土地，………从事为享受任何此项权利及优例所偶需或必需之任何事项，并不受干涉。”在表面上看来，似乎充满了平等互惠的精神，但是，我们决不能为表面的字眼所迷惑，而必须去考察条约所能发生的实际效果。如所周知，美国有的是资本，有的是价廉物美的商品，有的是重达十万吨的商船，人家当然可以根据这个商约的“平等”精神到中国来做生意，向我们中国的沿海和内地大量倾销其商品，而且可以输出资本，在我国成立商店，收买原料，开设工厂，做他们所愿意做的一切买卖，为所欲为。可是，我们呢？我们中国有资本可以输出到美国去成立商店，收买原料和开设工厂吗？有商品可以运到美国去“倾销”吗？有船只横渡烟波浩渺的太平洋去做买卖吗？关于这些问题，显然是只能有否定的答案。根据蒋政府官方的材料，从去年一月到九月，我国的进口货物价值是九千九百七十五万万元，其中美国输入占五千七百五十三万万元，占进口货物总价值的百分之五十八。美货充满了蒋管区一切大小城市与乡村，平津京沪等地，美国汽油比白开水的价钱还要贱，美国牛奶价格之低，使油条烧饼小贩也都失业了。至于我们的民族工业，自去年入秋到旧历年关为止，相继倒闭的就有二万七千余家，引起大批工人失业，流落街头，啼饥号寒，无以为生。蒋美商约实施后，这种现象只会更加严重。这些就是蒋美商约所“互惠”于中国人民的东西！
    蒋美商约第十六条第三款规定：“缔约此方对缔约彼方之任何种植物、出产物或制造品之输入、销售、分配或使用，或对输往缔约彼方领土之任何物品之输出，不得加以任何禁止或限制。”表面上看来，似乎也很公道，因为美国的农产品可以随便运到我们中国来出卖，我们中国的农产品也可以运到美国去，中国又是农业国家，美国是工业国家，应该可以把大批农产品运到美国出卖了吧。但实际情形却非如此，除了运输船舶成问题外，依照美国的国家法律，一切运往美国的货物，须经过出口港美国领事的允许，方能装运。换句话说，我国要运货物到美国去，必须先请美国领事馆检查和批准，否则美国便不准进口。“贸易”可以“自由”是一点也没有的。再者，中国虽然是农业国家，但生产方式和生产技术落后，成本高。价格也就高；美国虽然是工业国家，可是农业生产用的是机器，产量丰富，且成本低，价格也就低，加之又有船只运输等方便条件，无论如何中国是竞争不过美国的。根据蒋政府官方的统计，去年一月到九月，我国进口货物价值九千九百七十五万万元中，农产品方面，棉花及棉织品占二千八百六十六万万元，美国输入的即达一千一百四十万万元；果品蔬菜占一百三十九万万元，美国输入的即达九十七万万元；杂粮及杂粮粉占一百六十八万万元，美国输入的达四十万万元；烟草占二百六十二万万元，美国输入的即达二百五十五万万元；木材占八十七万万元，美国输入的即达五十五万万元。连这些农产品也被美国运来倾销，中国当然再没有什么主要的或大宗的农产品可以运到美国去出卖了。备受蒋家兵役粮店横征暴敛而凋敝枯竭的我国农村，在美国农产品倾销的打击与威胁之下，其前途诚不堪设想！
    上面只是随便举了两个例子，而这种不平等与独惠的实质和精神，是贯串于整个蒋美商约的每一条款的。
    那末，蒋美商约在文字上是不是完全“平等”、“互惠”的呢？不是！即使在文字上，也还有不平等和独惠于美国的规定。
    蒋美商约第二条第四款规定：“本约中任何规定，不得解释有影响缔约国任何一方有关入境移民之暴行法规，或制订有关入境移民法规之权利。”这就是说，美国人只要有美国官厅所发给的证明文件就可以进入中国，到中国领土全境居住旅行，从事商务、制造、加工、金融、科学、教育、宗教及慈善事业，中国政府不能加以干涉；而中国人进入美国，却仍要受美国“移民律”的限制。什么是“移民律”呢？这是美国所独有的专门禁止和限制别国人进入美国的法律。依照这种“移民律”规定，凡有色人种，过去都在“禁止移民”之列。白种人到美国去，也分两等，甲等叫“自由移民”，限于盎格鲁撒逊人（即英国人）；乙等叫“限额移民”，每年限定入境人数，对每个国家都有具体规定。美国禁止中国移民的法律，创始于一八八二年，一九一七年、一九二四年曾经有过修改。现在对中国人的待遇，是按照乙等“限额移民”办理，每年限额一百零四名，还要经过验病及向美国领事馆领取护照种种烦杂的手续。还有，美国不仅有国家的“移民律”，她的四十八个州还有地方的“移民法规”，从这一个州到那一个州去，还有种种麻烦和限制。中国人到美国去的入境自由既已剥夺竭尽，所谓居住、商务、制造、加工等等，也就成为水花镜月了。
    关于购置不动产的规定：倘美国任何州、领地或属地，有不许中国人民与美国人民享有同等之权利购置不动产时，则中国对美国之规定，亦可不适用。（第八条第一款）又第二十六条第四款规定：美国及其领地或属地或巴拿马运河区对古巴或菲律宾，所给予之优惠，概不适用。前一条的意思是说：美国人可以在中国购置任何不动产而不加以任何限制，但如果美国任何州现在或将来有限制中国人购置不动产的规定时，中国对在该州有住所之美国国民也可以无须给与优于该州所给予中国国民的权利。后者表示中国与美国虽互有“最惠国待遇”，即此方给予彼方均“不得低于现在或将来对于任何第三国的待遇。”但美国对于古巴及菲律宾的优惠，中国却不能援例。试问：中外古今，那有这样的“平等”与“互惠”？！
    事实了如烈火，蒋美商约中之美妙闪烁的词句，完全是为了欺骗中国人民，而且掩盖蒋贼卖国的罪行与劣迹。但中国人民的眼睛是雪亮的，对于任何独夫民贼对外所签订的丧权辱国条约，从来没有承认过；对于最不平等最可耻的出卖国条约之大成的蒋美商约，当然更是不会承认……。代表中国人民利益与意志的中国共产党的中央委员会最近已发表了郑重的声明，对于一九四六年一月十日以后由蒋介石政府单独成立的一切对外借款，一切丧尽辱国的条约，现在和将来均不承认，并决不担负任何义务。毫无疑义的，在这个正大庄严的昭告之下，全中国人民将为着废除蒋美商约，为着民族的独立、对美帝国主义及其走狗展开更坚决的斗争。
