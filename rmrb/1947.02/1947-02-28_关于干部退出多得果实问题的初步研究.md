　　Preliminary Research on the Issue of Cadres Returning Excess Gains
　　迦陵

　　During the land reform movement, due to the selfishness of some cadres, their ideas of privilege and merit, the phenomenon of cadres gaining excess benefits has occurred in many areas, and in some areas it is quite serious. According to a survey in Wei County, in 101 villages throughout the county, if the gains were distributed fairly and reasonably, everyone could receive an additional three mu of land. However, because village cadres obtained excessive gains (for example, the public security officer of a certain village, with a family of six, bought 80 mu of land), the land problems of many villages' poor peasants remained unresolved. To ensure that hired and poor peasants receive the benefits of land reform, it is crucial to seriously examine and resolve this issue in order to deepen the movement.

　　During the inspection, Zhu De's suggestion of "equal distribution" must be studied. But how should the meaning of equal distribution be understood? I believe it means making land ownership roughly equal, and the average amount of land or the average yield of the whole village should be the standard for equality. In our area, this equal distribution is the idea and slogan of "leveling the highs and compensating the lows," which is already familiar to the broad masses. In the past, we have done a good job of publicizing this idea and have achieved great results. In the future, we need to repeatedly promote it and vigorously implement it, so as to enable impoverished peasants to reach the living standards of middle peasants. If the gains obtained by cadres exceed this standard too much, in order to allow impoverished peasants to thoroughly turn over, to eliminate the gap between cadres and the masses, to achieve the unity of all peasants, and thereby improve the political level of cadres, cadres must return the excess portion.

　　In resolving the issue of cadres returning excess gains, most areas advocate returning the portion gained by cadres during this land reform movement to the masses, and have achieved great results in practice. However, opinions are still divided on whether to return the gains obtained in the past through the accounting of problems. Many places do not advocate returning them. I think this issue is worth studying.

　　The past method of accounting by problems allowed some people with many rent and interest problems to account for to obtain considerable gains, while those with no accounts to settle did not receive any gains. Of course, this is a historical issue. At that time, it was proper and reasonable for cadres to recover their hard-earned gains through struggles such as rent reduction and interest reduction. However, there are several situations worth noting: First, cadres got exactly what they calculated; the masses may not. Hu Tingyan, chairman of the Nong Hui (Peasant Association) in Guanjun Village, Qinyuan County, said in his self-criticism: "Others didn't get enough when calculating the landlords' things, but I got the original amount, and even got an extra stone mill." Second, in many places, cadres picked the best when buying gains and bought them first, while the masses did not have this convenience. When fruits were distributed this spring in the first district of Qinyuan County, the masses said: "Only Li Caiyuan is qualified to buy, because he is an old cadre from 1942." Third, the phenomenon of cadres buying gains cheaply is very common. Not only village cadres, but also some county and district cadres bought gains cheaply. This phenomenon had already aroused dissatisfaction among the masses at that time. Similar problems have not been resolved in some areas, but many places have resolved them well. For example, in Wangjiazhuang, Xiangyuan County, during this review of the turning over process, it was found that the fruit distribution this spring had affected 11 peasant households in the village who had not yet turned over. At that time, the village chief, Shen Lansheng, made a self-criticism in front of the masses: "This spring, I distributed 16 mu of good land, four cave dwellings, and more than 20 pieces of clothing, and my gains were indeed more than others." He then resolutely returned three mu of wheat seedlings, two mu of autumn land, and a leather robe. Under his influence, many cadres also returned land, houses, grain, livestock, etc. And the 800 village cadres in the county returned more than 1,000 mu of land and 300 houses. After discussion, Yan Yongzhi, a Communist Party member in Shijialing Village, Yangcheng County, took the lead and returned nine houses. Several village cadres in Wei County and Wu Xun also voluntarily returned the excess gains. These are all extremely valuable achievements.

　　Experience has shown that the correct policy for resolving this issue is to conduct education to raise the class consciousness of cadres, so that they can voluntarily give up excess gains on a conscious basis to help poor brothers turn over. According to the experience of various places, the following three links must be grasped when implementing the education policy: (1) self-reflection by cadres; (2) self-criticism by leaders; (3) opinions from the masses. Among these three links, self-reflection by cadres is fundamental. And there are two aspects to the self-criticism of leaders: First, county and district cadres should cooperate with practical actions to make self-criticism, first withdraw the cheaply bought fruits, and educate village cadres. There are already many examples of this in Taihang. One is that county and district cadres should first examine their own responsibilities. In the past, village cadres were not well educated, which resulted in cheap buying, excessive buying, and excessive gains. Jinnan counties have grasped this point very tightly and have made good achievements. Of course, the purpose of both is to better promote village cadres to consciously withdraw the excessive gains. As for the masses' opinions, they should be based on the principle of "talking about merits and talking about shortcomings," educating the masses to first recognize the merits of cadres in leading the masses' struggle, and then helping village cadres reflect. However, this point is more difficult to do. If it is not done well, it will become a pure attack on cadres, and it will create internal divisions among the peasants, giving landlords and bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of. For example, in Tou Village, Xiangyuan, when the leadership was solving the problem of cadres returning fruits, because they did not pay attention to opening up the cadres' minds, nor did they educate the masses, but first called on the peasants to make comments on the cadres. This allowed twelve targets of struggle to mix into the masses, destroying the progress of the movement, and conspiring to kill twelve village cadres. After this incident was discovered, cadres and the masses deeply realized that disunity within the peasants would create a great opportunity for the landlords. Another example is when the Sixth District of Qin County dealt with this problem, at first some villages, such as Ni Village, only unilaterally emphasized that the masses should check and give opinions. As a result, the cadres not only did not reflect, but instead went to inquire about who had made comments on them, preparing to retaliate. The relationship between cadres and the masses became more and more estranged. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately put forward the slogan of "walking face to face." They asked the masses: "If the cadres are not good, are there still some benefits?" After discussion by the masses, the advantages of the cadres were promoted. At the same time, the cadres were also asked to think: "You said that the masses are making things difficult for you, but have you not done anything to offend the masses?" This promoted reflection by the cadres and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.

　　However, what is more important is to organize cadres to take the lead. Facts have proved that in dealing with this issue, many village cadres still have some things they cannot figure out. They always feel that they were not afraid of offending the landlords in the past, and why should they return the fruits they have worked so hard to get? In addition, some are afraid of losing face, afraid of being punished, and afraid of losing prestige in the masses' struggle. Because of this, various places have adopted various methods to help village cadres open their minds. Many areas have adopted the method of comparing life and fruits with the masses; using historical memories, and having peasants who have not turned over tell their suffering to inspire cadres to be conscious. These methods have achieved the purpose of cadres consciously withdrawing the excess gains and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses. Some repeatedly stated that only those who have made mistakes and are unwilling to correct them, who are unwilling to put down their burdens, and who are unwilling to wipe off the black on their faces are the most shameful and cannot be forgiven by the masses. Only by putting down the burden, washing their faces and wiping off the black, and returning the excess or cheaply bought fruits to the masses can they restore their original prestige and be supported by the masses. These methods are all very good.

　　In short, cadres withdrawing excess or cheaply bought gains has become an urgent demand of peasants who have not turned over. In order to meet the demands of peasants who have not turned over, cadres must find ways to withdraw the excess gains. The main method is to make cadres more aware of the significance of "leveling the highs and compensating the lows" in their thinking, promote their reflection, and make them consciously and voluntarily withdraw.

　　关于干部退出多得果实问题的初步研究
    迦陵
    在土地改革运动中，由于某些干部存在着自私心理、（特权思想与功劳观点，干部多得果实的现象，不少地区均已发生，若干地区并且相当严重。据威县调查，全县一百零一个村中，如何将果实公平合理分配，每人都可补到三亩地。但由于村干分得果实过多（某村公安员，六口人，买了八十亩地），许多村庄的贫农仍未解决土地问题。为了确保雇贫农得到土地改革的利益，认真检查与解决这一问题，实为深入运动中的重要工作。
    在检查时，须把朱总司令所提“平均分配”的建议加以研究。但平均分配的意思究竟应如何了解？我以为就是使土地占有大致趋于平均，而中农的土地或全村土地的平均数与平均产量就是平均的标准。这种平均分配，在我区就是已经为广大群众所熟悉的“填平补齐”的思想、口号。过去我们对于这一思想已经做了很好的宣传，且获得很大成绩。今后尤需反复宣传，大力贯彻，务使赤贫农达到中农的生活标准。如果干部所得果实，超过这个标准过多，为了使赤贫农彻底翻身，为了解除干部与群众间的隔阂，达到全体农民的团结，并从而提高干部的政治水平，就必须使干部退出多得部分。
    在解决干部退出多得果实问题时，各地多主张把此次土地改革运动中干部多得部分，退给群众，并且在实践中已获得很大成绩。但是，对过去按问题分得的果实，是否要退？各地意见还不一致。有许多地方就不主张退。我觉得这问题值得研究。
    过去按问题算账的办法，使一些租息问题多，有账可算的人得到了不少果实；而无账可算的人就没有得到果实。当然这是一个历史问题。在那时，干部经过减租减息等斗争，收回自己的血汗账就应该的、合理的。但是，有几种情况值得注意：第一，干部实算实得；群众就不一定。沁源官军村农会主席胡廷彦检讨时说：“别人算地主的东西都得不够，我却原数都得到了，并且还多得了碾子。”第二，不少地方干部买果实有拣好的、先买等现象，群众却无此便利条件。沁源县第一川今春分果实时，群众就说：“只有李财源一人有资格买，因为他是四二年的老干部。”第三，干部贱买果实现象很多。不仅村干部如此，若干县区干部也有贱买果实者。这种现象在当时已经引起群众不满。类似以上问题，有的地区一直没得解决，但也有许多地方解决得很好。如襄垣王家庄在此次检查翻身时，发现由于今春按问题分果实，以致影响了村内还有十一户农民没有翻身。当时村长申兰生即在群众面前检讨：“今春分了十六亩好地、四孔窑、二十多件衣服，果实确比别人多。”遂坚决退出三亩麦苗地、二亩秋地、一件皮袍。在他的影响下，又有许多干部退出地、房、粮食、牲口等。而全县八百村干部退出土地千多亩，房三百间，阳城史家岭村支部经过讨论，共产党员阎永智以身作则，退出房子九间；威县、武训的若干村干，亦纷纷自动退出多得果实。这都是极可宝贵的成绩。
    经验证明：解决这一问题的正确方针是进行教育，提高干部的阶级觉悟，使其在自觉的基础上拿出多得果实，帮助穷弟兄翻身。在执行教育方针时，根据各地经验来看，又必须掌握三个环节：（一）干部的自我反省；（二）领导上的自我批评；（三）群众提意见。在这三个环节中，干部的自我反省又是基本的。而领导上的自我批评，亦有两个方面：一是县区干部以自我检讨配合实际行动，首先退出贱买果实，教育村干部。这在太行已有不少范例。一是县区干部首先检查自己的责任。由于过去对村干部没有很好的进行教育，以致发生了贱买、多买，多得果实等现象。冀南各县对这一点抓得很紧，且已做出了很好的成绩。当然这两者的目的，均系为了更好促使村干部自觉退出多得果实。至于群众提意见，即应本着“谈功劳、谈缺点”的原则，教育群众首先认识干部在领导群众斗争中的功劳，然后帮助村干部反省。不过，这一点是比较难做的，弄不好，就会变成是纯打击干部，且会造成农民内部的分裂，使地主与坏分子有隙可乘。例如襄垣头村，领导上在解决干部退果实问题时，因为没有注意打通干部思想，也没有教育群众，而首先号召农民向干部提意见。这样就使十二户斗争对象混进群众中，破坏运动的进展，并阴谋打死十二个村干部。这事情被发现后，干部和群众都深刻认识到农民内部不团结，是会给地主造成很大的空子。又如沁县六区处理这一问题时，起初有些村子，如倪村，只片面的强调了由群众检查，提意见，结果干部不仅不反省，反而专去打听谁对他们提了意见，准备报复。弄得干、群关系越来越隔阂。领导上发现后，当即提出“面对面走”的口号。向群众提出：“干部不好，究竟还有些好处没有？”经过群众讨论，发扬干部的优点。同时，又让干部想想：“你说群众和你为难，难道你就没有对不起群众的地方？”这样即促使了干部反省，密切了干、群关系。
    但是，更重要的还是很好的组织干部带头。事实证明，在处理这个问题上，村干部还有不少想不通的地方。他们总觉得自己过去不怕得罪地主，辛辛苦苦得来的果实，为什么还要退呢？另外，有的还怕丢人，怕受处分，怕群众斗争失掉威信等等。正因为如此，各地便采用了各种各样的办法，帮助村干部打通思想。许多地区采用了与群众比生活比果实的办法；用回忆历史，用未翻身的农民诉苦，启发干部自觉。这些办法，都达到了干部自觉退出多得果实与密切干、群关系的目的。有的则反复说明，只有犯了错误不愿改正，背上包袱不愿放下，脸上有黑不愿擦掉的人，才最丢人，最不能得到群众的原谅。只要能放下包袱，洗脸擦黑，将多得或贱买的果实退还群众，然后才能恢复原有威信，得到群众的拥护。这些方法都是很好的。
    总之，干部退出多得或贱买果实，已经成为未翻身农民的迫切要求。为了满足未翻身农民的要求，干部多得的果实必须设法使其退出，其办法主要的是使干部在思想上更加明确“填平补错”的意义，促使其反省，使其自觉自愿的退出来。
