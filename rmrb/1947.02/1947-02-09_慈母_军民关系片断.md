Kind Mother
Fragments of Army-People Relations
Mei Cun

Braving the drizzling autumn rain, I walked all night and day. My whole body was soaked, and my bedroll was like it had just been fished out of the water. My back ached, my legs were sore, and my calves felt like they had two anvils tied to them.

As dusk approached, we arrived at Hujia Ping, which was our campsite.

In a small square courtyard. Four earthen rooms, from the door on the right, came an old woman, about fifty or sixty years old. She wore a half-worn blue cloth garment, a head of disheveled white hair, a thin yellow face, prominent cheekbones, and a face full of wrinkles, like a dried walnut. She smiled and greeted us.

"Oh dear! Look at the comrades, drenched like drowned chickens! Come into the house quickly... Oh dear!..." As she spoke, she reached out to take my bedroll from my back.

"It's alright, I'll carry it myself, old lady!" I said, smiling as I declined, and walked into the house.

The other comrades also politely declined her help.

The room was empty, but very clean. There was a mat on the kang (platform bed).

"Sit down and rest! These days, I heard the Kuomintang troops are going to attack. I hid all my belongings. This mat was only pulled out when I heard you comrades were coming... Haha..."

We placed our bedrolls on the mat and sat down. Our bodies trembled slightly from the cold.

"Old lady, we are troubling you!"

"Don't mention the trouble, we're all one family..."

She smiled and ran out, and in a moment, she dragged in a log of wood, with an axe in one hand. The wood was covered in dirt, obviously just dug out of the ground.

We guessed that she was going to make a fire for us. Before she could put it down, we stopped her, saying: "Old lady, don't burn your firewood. We will fetch firewood in a while!"

"Just burn this, it's the same!" As she spoke, she put down the wood and raised the axe to chop it.

Seeing that we couldn't stop her, we discussed: we'll give her money later, or return her firewood, but we can't let her chop it. Everyone rushed to snatch the axe from her hand.

"Yes! Burning your firewood first is fine, but let us chop it ourselves. You're so old..."

"Hey, hey, no need, no need! I can chop it. You're tired from running, rest a little longer." She held tightly to the axe handle, refusing to let go.

In the end, old Wang snatched the axe and started chopping.

The old woman did not rest, but ran to find a handful of dry grass, and lit the firewood in the corner of the room.

"Hurry up and warm yourselves, don't catch a cold!"

We all gathered around the roaring flames, took off our coats, and began to dry them.

She ran out again and brought in a large iron, put fire inside it, and placed it on the kang. Then, she bent down and began to unpack the bedrolls.

"Oh my heavens! Look how wet the quilts are! How will you sleep tonight!?" She muttered to herself as she unpacked, "It's all the fault of that turtle-son Chiang Kai-shek! If it weren't for his mischief, the comrades wouldn't have to suffer like this. Chiang Kai-shek, the damned!"

She bit her teeth hard, as if she wanted to bite something off. We asked her again: let us dry the quilts ourselves, don't worry, old lady. But she wouldn't listen. Instead, she put on a stern face, like a mother scolding her children:

"You all hurry up and dry your clothes! It won't do if the clothes aren't dry. I'm idle anyway, what's wrong with helping the comrades dry them?..."

Unable to dissuade her, we had to let her do it.

She spread the quilt on the kang and began ironing it with the heated iron. A puff of white smoke rose from the place the iron passed. After ironing it several times, it dried. She ironed patiently and carefully, ironing one strip dry before ironing the second.

It was getting darker and darker, so she ran to light a sesame oil lamp. Under the dim lamplight, she continued to work...

We felt indescribable gratitude to her, and didn't know how to repay her. When it was time for dinner, we scooped a large bowl of rice and half a teacup of vegetables, and took them back to her, because she hadn't eaten yet.

But she refused to take it, tearing at it for a long time before reaching out and taking it, placing it on the windowsill. She continued to iron the quilts.

We urged her to eat while it was hot, and then iron. But she said sternly:

"Eating is a small matter, the comrades' sleep is a big matter. Maybe they'll have to go to war tonight."

She paused, thought for a moment, and suddenly seemed to remember something and said:

"Hey, when are you going to fight?"

We said, "We don't know." She bit her teeth and said fiercely:

"Fight! Don't let those scourges come! Our people have just turned over, if they come, we won't be able to live!"

"Old lady, has your family suffered at the hands of Chiang Kai-shek?" one of our comrades asked.

"How could we not! When the Japanese were here, Hu Yougui became the village chief. He confessed that he was the Kuomintang's something district branch secretary, I don't remember clearly. Relying on the power of the Japanese, he rode on the heads of the people and shit on them. He dragged my child's father to do corvee labor, and he died outside and never came back! Then he said my child was a secret Eighth Route Army soldier – my child was a secret militiaman at that time – forcing my child to be afraid to stay at home, and he ran to the mountains... He dragged my old woman to beat me half to death, half alive! Look, the scars on my hands! On my hips, on my waist, and more... Beating people wasn't enough, he also swindled me out of five mu of land – that was my five mu of lifeline! Wouldn't that be taking my life! ...Alas! Comrade, I dare not mention the past..."

Her tears fell like broken beads onto the quilt.

"What about that traitor Hu?" a comrade asked urgently.

"He was beaten to death by our people! In the autumn of that year, the Eighth Route Army came... Ah! This time, the people finally had a hole in the kiln roof and saw the blue sky! ...I avenged my revenge, cleared my hatred, took back my five mu of land, and also received ten mu of good land and this courtyard... My child also came back and became the militia captain. This spring, he married a new wife... I often think, I'm like a tree that's about to dry up, but the Communist Party watered it, and now it's full of flowers... Haha..."

"What about your child and daughter-in-law?" I hurriedly interjected.

"Oh, I haven't gotten to that yet... This autumn, the government mobilized people to join the army, and I sent my child. I said: Child, go! Go and fight Chiang Kai-shek well. Chiang Kai-shek is the same as the Japanese, if you don't drive him away, if he comes, we won't be able to keep the fruits of our liberation. Before, when you were a secret militiaman, he arrested you. Now, you're the militia captain, go fight! My daughter-in-law? Well, she went back to her mother's house..."

In this way, while we talked, she continued to iron the quilts non-stop.

She crawled on the quilt, carefully ironing one end and one side. We repeatedly urged her to eat first, but she refused. Only when a comrade who had dried his clothes first snatched the iron did she pick up the bowl of cold rice and go to the room on the left.

At night, because the situation changed, we got up again before we fell asleep.

The old woman also got up. She wanted to cook for us, but we said we didn't have time to eat. She wanted to boil water for us, but we said we didn't have time to drink. ...She repeatedly said how sorry she was.

We said goodbye to her. We gave her money for firewood and lamp oil. She refused no matter what, and said angrily:

"What? Aren't we one family?!"

There was no way, so we had to quietly press the money under her lampstand. We left.

She saw us off to the gate, and in the darkness, she told us with sadness:

"Don't forget this old woman! Come to my house if you pass by here on your way back..."

    慈母
    军民关系片断
    梅村
    冒着籁籁的秋雨，走了一夜一天。全身衣服都湿透了，被包像刚从水里捞出来。腰疼、腿酸，两个腿肚子上，像拴了两个铁砧子。
    天快黑的时候，到了胡家坪，这就是我们的宿营地。
    在一个小方院里。四间土屋，右边的门里，出来一个老太太，约五六十岁。穿一身半旧蓝布衣裳，一头蓬松的白发，一副削瘦的黄脸，颧骨凸出着，满脸皱纹，像一颗干核桃。她笑着，向我们迎来。
    “啊呀！看同志们淋成水母鸡啦！快到屋里来，………啊呀！………”说着，她伸手来接我背上的被包。
    “不要紧，我自己拿，老太太！”我笑着谢绝他，走进屋里去。
    其他同志，也都照例这样谢绝她。
    屋里空落落的，但扫的很干净。炕上放着一条席子。
    “快坐下歇歇吧！这几天，听说遭殃军要进攻啦，俺把东西都藏啦，这条席子，是听说同志们来啦，才扒出来的……哈哈……。”
    我们把被包放在席上，都坐下去。身体冷得微微发抖。
    “老太太，麻烦你老人家啦！”
    “可不要说麻烦啦，一家人不说两家话……。”
    她笑着跑出去，顷刻拉着一骨辘木头进来，一只手提一把斧子。木头上沾着泥土，显然也是才从土里扒出来的。
    我们已猜着她是要给我们生火的，没等她放下，就拦住说：“老太太，不用烧你的柴，我们等一会就领来劈柴啦！”
    “就烧这吧，一样！”说着，她把木头放下，抡起斧子劈起来。
    我们看拦不住，于是一商量：回头给她钱，或还她柴火吧，可是不能让她给劈，大家就抢着夺她手中的斧子。
    “对！先烧你这柴也行，那就叫我们自己劈吧，你这么大年纪啦……。”
    “哎，哎，不用，不用！我可以劈，你们跑累了，多歇一会。”她紧握住斧子柄死不丢。
    结果，是老王夺过斧子劈起来。
    老太太并未休息，又跑去找了一把干草，在屋角里把劈柴火生起来。
    “赶快烘烘吧，看冻下病啦！”
    我们都围过去，在熊熊的火焰旁，脱下上衣烘起来。
    她又跑出去，拿来一个大熨斗，在它里面架上火，放到炕上。然后，伏下身子解被包。
    “啊呀，老天爷哪！你看被子湿成啥！？夜里怎样睡呀！”她一面解，一面自言自语说：“都是蒋介石龟孙子作的孽！要不是他胡闹，同志们也不会受这种罪，蒋介石这该死的！……”
    她把牙狠狠的一咬，好像要咬掉什么。我们又要求她：被子让我们自己烤，不要你老人家操心。但是，她不听，她反而板起面孔，像母亲训孩子似的：
    “你们快烘衣服吧！衣服烘不干也是不行的。俺闲着没事，帮同志们烘一烘有啥关系？……”
    扭不过她，只好让她烘去。
    她把被子铺在炕上，用烧热的熨斗，在上面烫起来。熨斗经过的地方，冒起一股白烟，烫上几遍，就干啦。她耐心地细致地烫着，烫干一条，再烫第二条。
    天气越来越暗，她就跑去点了一盏麻油灯。在暗淡的灯光下，继续的工作。……
    我们说不出的感激她，不知怎样报答她才好。吃晚饭时，盛了满满一大碗干饭，和半茶缸菜，给她带回去。因为她还没吃饭哩。
    但她说啥也不接，撕揣了半天，才伸手接过去，放在窗台上。仍继续烫着被子。
    我们催促她趁热吃，吃了再烫。她却严正地说：
    “吃饭事小，同志们睡觉事大呀，说不定夜里还要去打仗呢。”
    她把话停住，沉思了一下，忽然想起了什么似地说：
    “喂，你们啥时候去打仗？”
    我们说：“不清楚”。她把牙一咬，狠狠地说：
    “打呀！可不要让那些祸害来！咱老百姓刚刚翻了身，叫他们来，就又活不成啦！”
    “老太太，你家受过老蒋的苦害没有？”我们中的一个问起来。
    “咋没有！老日在时候，胡有贵当了村长，他自己坦白说是国民党什么区分部书记呢，俺记不清啦，仗着老日势力，骑在老百姓头上拉屎。把俺孩他爹拉去支差，死在外面没回来！……又说俺孩是暗八路——俺孩那时候是暗民兵，——逼的俺孩不敢在家，跑到山上……。又把俺个死老婆子，拉去打的死几死，活几活！——你看，俺这手上的伤！胯上，腰上，还有咧，……打了人还不算，又讹去俺五亩地——俺就那五亩命根子呀！你说不是活活要俺的命是啥！……唉！同志，过去的事情不敢提……。”
    她的眼泪，像断了线的珠子，扑籁籁掉到被子上。
    “那个姓胡的汉奸呢？”一个同志急急地问。
    “叫咱老百姓给砸死啦！年时秋天，八路军来了，……啊呀！这一下老百姓算是窑顶上透了个洞，见青天啦！……俺报了仇，雪了恨，把五亩地要回来了，另外又分到了十亩好地，和这一所院子，……俺的孩也回来啦，当了民兵队长。今年春天，娶了个新媳妇……。俺常想，俺像一株快干死的树，被共产党浇了水，又开了满树花啦……哈哈，……”
    “你的孩和媳妇呢？”我急忙插问。
    “吆，俺还没说到呢，……今年秋天，政府动员参军哩，俺就送俺的孩去了。俺说：孩呀，去吧！去好好打老蒋吧，老蒋和老日一样，不打走他，要叫他来了，俺家的翻身果实总是保不住啊。从前你当暗民兵他还捉你呢，这阵，你当了民兵队长，打去吧！俺媳妇？唔，她回娘家了……。”
    就这样，我们一面拉话，一面她仍不停手的烫被子。
    她爬在被子上，细心地一头一头，一面一面的烫着。我们一再催她先吃饭都不肯，还是一个先烤干衣服的同志夺过熨斗来，她才端起那碗冷饭，到左边那个房里去了。
    夜里因为情况变化，我们还没睡着觉，就又起来了。
    老太太也起来了。要给我们做饭，我们说来不及吃了，要给我们烧开水，我们说来不及喝了。………她一再说着过意不去的话。
    我们向她告别。给她柴火钱，灯油钱。她无论如何不要，并且，生气地说：
    “怎么？不是一家人啦！？”
    没办法，只得把钱悄悄压在他的灯台下。走了。
    她把我们送到大门外，在黑暗中，难过地叮嘱我们：
    “不要忘记俺这死老婆子呀！回来路过这里，到俺家……。”
