　　Inspired by New Glorious Tasks
    Military University Students Diligently Practice Skills
    A Large Number of Cadres Will Go to the Front Lines
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] To fully support the front lines and ensure the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, Deputy Commander Teng of the military region announced at a meeting that the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University will soon send ××× cadres to the front lines to meet the counter-offensive. This nationally renowned military and political university trained countless military and political cadres during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, defeating Japanese imperialism. Now, in order to strive for the realization of the motherland's new independence, peace, and democracy, it is undertaking an even greater and more glorious task than in the past. To understand the current intense training situation at the Military University, this reporter paid a special visit to Deputy Commander Teng, who is also the President and Political Commissar of the Military University, as Deputy Commander Teng personally went to the Military University to guide the work after the New Year. Regarding the current situation of the Military University, he gave the following brief introduction to the reporter: The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University was formed after the Ping-Han Campaign, when the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group was determined to betray the country and engage in dictatorial civil war. It consisted of the Taihang Detachment, Taiyue Detachment, and part of the Yan'an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University Headquarters, plus the Army Middle School and other units. Although the several parts were not familiar with each other, inspired by the new glorious tasks, they fully understood the importance of training military cadres today. Therefore, in the midst of intensive teaching, everyone united closely.
    Since its establishment, the school has successively enrolled ××× military and political cadres from this region and educated youth from the KMT-controlled areas for training. The entire study is divided into two stages: preparatory and undergraduate. The teaching policy is mainly to combine theory with practice (combine with war, combine with local work). The main content of preparatory study is political rectification and current affairs education. Through this kind of study, each student clearly recognizes that he is a cadre of the people's army and must wholeheartedly and loyally serve the people. This education has also been well tested among the masses. Last summer and autumn, the Military University organized turn-over teams to participate in the Jinnan mass turn-over movement, helping peasants obtain land and organize militia guerrilla teams. The turn-over troupe they organized gave the liberated peasants great education and inspiration. More than 1,000 students from Taihang and Taiyue have now transferred to undergraduate studies. Motivated by the enthusiasm to go to the front lines, they have achieved great results in the four major technical studies: grenade throwing, shooting, bayonet fighting, and earthwork operations. For example, in grenade throwing, the standard specified in the education plan is 35 meters, but each team has already reached 32.5 meters, and the farthest has reached 47.7 meters. It is expected that grenade throwing will exceed the original plan in the shortest possible time. In terms of shooting, the plan requires 70% of live ammunition to hit the target, but the current general level has exceeded 66%, and some have reached 75% to 80%. As for earthwork operations and bayonet fighting, everyone is as serious as in combat, regardless of day or night, regardless of the cold weather, everyone is working hard and practicing intensively. Therefore, their skills are quickly becoming proficient. This group of students will successfully complete their studies by the end of next month and go to the front lines. More than 500 cadres from the Yu-Wan-Su Military Region entered the Military University for study for only three months, but because of the rapid development of the situation in the region, the enthusiasm for learning has become even higher. They will complete the first phase of their study plan by the end of this month and return to work in their region. He also said that the Military University has also achieved great results in educating more than 2,000 Chiang-Yan military officers at the school and battalion level who laid down their weapons during the Dang-Ping-Han Campaigns. In addition to a small number who resolutely requested to stay in the Eighth Route Army for further study and work, most were happily sent home to do the work of opening up the second battlefield. Before leaving, they expressed that they would never be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek again, and swore to go to the KMT-controlled areas and their troops to carry out revolutionary work. In addition, General Gao Shudong also sent hundreds of cadres to the Military University to study the mass line and troop training methods of the people's army. In their studies, they painfully denounced the darkness of Chiang Kai-shek's army and praised General Gao's Handan Uprising, guiding them onto the path of light. At this point, Deputy Commander Teng pointed out four recent experiences in teaching at the Military University: (1) In-depth political and ideological mobilization has guaranteed the students' high enthusiasm and initiative in learning, and motivated each student to formulate a personal study plan, which has also well coordinated the completion of the entire school education plan. (2) Good use of clubs, blackboards, and radio stations to commend heroes and models in learning can greatly increase the enthusiasm of all students for learning. The improvement of students' lives has fully guaranteed the progress of learning. Each person at the Military University can now eat two catties of meat per month, can often eat tofu, and can eat six cents of oil and salt per day. (3) Organize mutual assistance visits. Classes and teams exchange learning experiences and lessons through it. This approach has greatly promoted and encouraged learning. (4) In terms of education methods, we should implement the mass line, advocate hard work, less lecturing and more practice, and encourage students to discuss and research more. Teachers should not give academy-style lectures, but only make some inspirations. Finally, Deputy Commander Teng called on cadres in the army, cadres in the locality, middle and high school students in the liberated areas, and intellectuals in the countryside to enthusiastically apply to the Military University for study, and welcomed young students and intellectuals from the KMT-controlled areas to study at the Military University, to jointly strive for the early realization of a new China with independence, peace, and democracy.

　　在新的光荣任务鼓舞下
    军大学生苦练技术
    大批干部将赴前线
    【本报特讯】全力支援前线，一切为着爱国自卫战争的胜利。军区滕副司令员，在某次会议上当场宣布，晋冀鲁豫军政大学即将欢送×××位干部走上前线，迎接反攻。这座全国闻名的军政大学，在八年抗战期间曾训练了无数万的军政干部，打败了日本帝国主义。现在，为着争取祖国新的独立和平与民主的实现，它又担负起较之过去更重大的光荣任务了。记者为了了解军大目前紧张训练的情形，特拜访军大兼校长政委滕副司令员，因为滕副司令员于新年之后曾亲赴军大指导工作。关于军大目前情况，承向记者作如下的简述：晋冀鲁豫军政大学是在蒋介石反动集团决心卖国独裁内战的平汉战役以后，才由抗大太行大队、太岳大队、延安抗大总校一部，加上陆军中学等部组成的。几个部分虽在不熟习，但在新的光荣任务鼓舞下，他们充分理解到今天培养军队干部的重要性；因而在紧张的教学中，全体亲密的团结起来了。
    学校成立后，已先后招收本区军政干部及蒋管区知识青年共×××人进行训练。整个学习分预科、本科两个步骤。教学方针主要是与实际相结合（与战争结合，与地方工作结合）。预科学习的主要内容是政治整训、时事教育。通过这种学习使每个学员明确认识自己是人民军队的干部，必须全心合力忠诚为人民服务。他们这种教育又很好的在群众中进行了考验。去年夏秋，军大曾组织了翻身队参加冀南群众翻身运动，帮助农民取得土地，组织民兵游击队。他们组织的翻身剧团，更给翻身农民以极大教育和鼓舞。太行、太岳参加的一千多位学生，目前已转入本科学习，他们在奔赴前线的热情激励下，投弹、射击、刺杀、土工作业等四大技术学习已获得很大成绩。比如投弹，教育计划规定的标准是三十五米达，现各队已达到三二点五米达，远的已达四七点七米达，预计最短期内投弹即达超过原定计划。在射击方面，计划要求实弹命中百分之七十，现一般水平已过百分之六十六，有的已达百分之七十五到百分之八十。至于土工作业和刺杀，大家也同作战一样的认真，不管白天黑夜，不管天寒地冻，每个人都在紧张的苦练和演习。因此，他们的技术就很快的熟练了。这一批学生，下月底即可胜利完成学习，开赴前线。豫皖苏军区五百多位干部进入军大学习才三个月，因为该区形势的迅速开展，学习情绪便更加高涨，他们在本月底即可完成第一期学习计划，回归本区工作。他又说：军大在教育上党、平汉两役放下武器的二千多位蒋阎军校尉级军官方面，也获得很大成绩。他们除少数坚决要求留在八路军继续深造和工作外，大部都被欢送回家去做开辟第二战场的工作，他们临别除表示再也不作蒋介石的炮灰外，并宣誓到蒋管区及其部队去进行革命的工作。此外，高树动将军也送来了几百位干部到军大学习人民军队的群众路线和练兵方法。他们在学习中，沉痛的控诉了蒋介石军队的黑暗，而歌颂着高将军的邯郸起义，引导着他们走上了光明。至此，滕副司令员指出了军大最近教学上的四点经验：（一）深入政治思想动员，保证了学员们高度的学习热情和积极性，发动每个学员订个人学习计划，又很好配合了整个学校教育计划的完成。（二）很好的利用俱乐部、黑板报、广播电台，去表扬学习中的英雄和模范，可以大大提高全体学员学习的热情。学员生活的改善，又充分的保证了学习的进行。军大现每人每月可以吃到两斤肉，可以经常吃到豆腐，每天每人可以吃到六钱油和盐。（三）组织互助参观。班与班、队与队，通过它来交流学习心得和经验。这种办法，对学习推动鼓励很大。（四）教育方法上，应贯彻群众路线，提倡苦练少讲多作，多让学生讨论研究，教员不作学院式的讲授，只作一些启发。最后，滕副司令员号召军队里的干部、地方上的干部、解放区的大中学生、在乡知识分子，涌跃的到军大来投考学习，欢迎蒋管区的青年学生们、知识分子们来军大学习，共同争取祖国独立和平民主新中国早日的实现。
