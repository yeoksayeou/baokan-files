　　The midday sun shone on the clear river water. Along the riverbank, a group of old men and middle-aged men dressed in peasant clothes hurried along. They crossed the wooden bridge and entered the wicker gate with the wooden sign "Zhuhai County Majining District Workers and Peasants Joint Association."

　　These peasants were all comrades of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army ten years ago, each with a hard and heroic experience. When General Zhao Shangzhi, General Li Zhaolin, and Comrade Feng Chongyun successively left Zhuhai, they were unable to follow, either because they were injured or because they were old. They hid their identities, sold labor, endured hardship, rented land, endured the bullying of Japanese invaders, traitors, secret agents, and police, and waited, waited, waited for the day of liberation. Ten years passed, and the comrades of the work team arrived in Wujimi. They lived in poor people's homes, helped carry water, swept the floor, and chatted cordially with the people about national affairs... From their behavior, style, and the content of their conversations, this group of people who had not dared to reveal a word for ten years finally revealed the affectionate word "Anti-Japanese Allied Army" to their own people.

　　Today, they rushed to the District Workers and Peasants Joint Association from the village because "Old Feng," who had once led them in battle, was coming to see them.

　　Even the youngest of them had deep wrinkles on their foreheads. They smoked tobacco and talked about the past—the past that they remembered as soon as they closed their eyes; they talked about familiar people—those who had once been in and out of the line of fire together; they talked about the small Old Zhao, the square-faced Representative Zhang (Note 1), the bearded Old Feng... They talked as if the river had opened the floodgates, they talked as if time had gone back ten years.

　　"Chairman Feng is here! Chairman Feng is here!"

　　The shouting outside the window had just died down when the door was pushed open, and the stalwart, cherry-colored wool hat wearing, black-rimmed glasses, the Old Feng that everyone was talking about and looking forward to walked in. He was one of the leaders of the former Anti-Japanese Allied Army's Third Army, and now the Chairman of Songjiang Province, Comrade Feng Zhongyun.

　　Old Lu, who was fifty-eight years old, rushed over from the kang and grabbed Chairman Feng's arm: "Old Feng, it's been more than ten years!" He smiled, he pulled hard, his eyes were bright with tears. The rest of the people came together, squeezed in front of the kang, climbed onto the kang, and surrounded "Old Feng," who was pulled onto the kang by Old Lu.

　　Chairman Feng reached out and shook hands with those old comrades one by one. His bold and loud voice poured into everyone's heart: "I recognize you!—You, I recognize you too!—It's just been too long! I can't remember the names, it's been too long!"

　　Old Lu leaned his face closer and carefully looked at Chairman Feng for a while, saying happily: "You've gotten fat!"

　　"Old Luo! Your hair has also thinned!" Chairman Feng took off his wool hat, revealing his bald forehead.

　　"It's been more than ten years!" Voices of emotion came from both on and off the kang.

　　"Are those old people in Sangu Liuba, Banjie Hezi still around?" Chairman Feng asked with concern.

　　"Some have moved, some have left, they've all been replaced by new people."

　　"Oh!" Chairman Feng retracted his forward-leaning upper body and fell silent.

　　The comrades of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army asked Old Feng about the names of the people they were concerned about, asking about their whereabouts:

　　"Where did Director Guan (Note 2) go?"

　　"He died in battle! Died in Xiabala!"

　　"What about Old Wu?"

　　"Is that Wu Damaizi who always had seven-star ammunition in his waist? He also sacrificed himself."

　　"Is Old Liu still there?"

　　"Liu Haitao?" (Note 3) He entered the pass and became a sub-district commander in Shandong, and later he also sacrificed himself."

　　"Is Zhang Lianke (Note 4) still alive?"

　　"No more. He died in Tieling!—Not many of the old comrades of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army who went out from here are alive. Nine out of ten have died." Chairman Feng's tone was filled with remembrance and emotion.

　　"Ah!" Long sighs were drawn from all around. These best comrades, the closest relatives, "nine out of ten have died," and years of silent prayers and secret wishes were in vain. People's hearts felt like they were weighed down by a piece of lead.

　　The door opened, and two more old men came in, Old Yangtou and Old Di. Old Yangtou was one of the first seven people organized by General Zhao Shangzhi. As soon as he entered the door, he said: "I was harvesting in the field. I heard you were coming soon, so I quickly dropped my crops and ran over. When I saw two large carts coming down the road, I could see from afar that the tall man with glasses was you, sure enough!" He took off his hat, revealing short silver hair, climbed onto the kang, and sat to Chairman Feng's left: "How did you guys get through afterwards?"

　　"That was really hard!" Chairman Feng shook his head slightly, "In 1935, the Japanese devils launched a large-scale attack on us, burning houses and stockades. It was a really fierce burning. By 1936, we couldn't settle down. Old Zhao left first, then Old Wang also left, and finally Zhang Lianke and I also left Zhuhai, went to Bin County, crossed the river, passed through Tongjiang, and went to Tangyuan. There, we met Commander Zhao and Representative Zhang, had a meeting, and organized the people in the Xiajiang area. Yilan, Tongjiang, Fujin, Tangyuan, Boli... The common people all rose up, and the strength was much greater than it was here. The Anti-Japanese Allied Army expanded to ten armies. But the little Japanese devils set fire to houses again. We couldn't move around and went back to the villages. We couldn't leave the stockade during the day, and only came out at night to pick corn and dig potatoes to eat..."

　　"In the end, the Japanese devils burned more and more fiercely. We entered small villages, they burned small villages, we entered big villages, they burned big villages. Just like that, they merged small villages into big villages, and big villages into even bigger villages, burning the point that only eight large villages were left in the entire county! Our troops couldn't enter the stockades."

　　"But the Anti-Japanese Allied Army is a team led by the Communist Party, how could there be surrender or submission!"

　　"Rather die than submit!" Several voices burst out simultaneously. This was the familiar battle oath of the old days! Everyone suddenly raised their heads.

　　"Later we went to Heilongjiang, and the Japanese devils still used the same method to deal with us. We retreated to Beida Mountain. Ah, the climate there was much colder than here! And there was no food. Summer was okay, everyone picked leaves and collected mountain vegetables to eat—I recognized fifty-two kinds of mountain vegetables. But when autumn came, the frost killed all the leaves. Everyone slaughtered horse meat to eat, boiled horse skin to eat, and even gnawed the horse bones clean. Not to mention corn husks, even Wula boots were taken off and boiled to eat!"

　　"Difficult!" In the midst of the sighs, some people's eyes were wet.

　　"Five years ago, I was active outside, and Representative Zhang commanded the troops inside. He didn't have a single grain of rice for fifty days, and the brothers were so hungry that they couldn't get up from the ground. Later, we carried grain in, made soup with millet, and poured it into them one by one, and only then did they come back to life." Chairman Feng paused, and the room was silent as death.

　　"Winter was really deadly!" Chairman Feng raised his glasses and continued: "The enemy was advancing behind us. We had to walk during the day, circling in the mountain valleys. At night, we didn't have houses to live in, and we were too poor to buy tents. The snow fell so deep (Chairman Feng pressed his waist), what should we do? Everyone stepped on the snow, made a snow shell, and lit a pile of fire—it wasn't comfortable to bake by the fire! The fire warmed the chest, but the wind blew cold on the back, and the snowy wind pierced through the back—lying in the snow shell was considered sleeping. Even so, we didn't stop fighting for a single day." Chairman Feng quickly raised his glasses again, and the gloomy tone turned into cheerfulness. "We finally survived several winters, and survived until 'August 15th.' The Soviet Red Army sent troops, and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army launched a pincer attack, and the Japanese devils surrendered. The scattered Anti-Japanese Allied Army expanded again and formed the Democratic Allied Army. We said a long time ago: "We must win! Don't think the Japanese devils' guns and cannons are fierce, they will definitely collapse in the future!" Now what? We weren't wrong in the past, were we! The little Japanese devils ultimately couldn't 'float' past us, and presented their treasures in front of us!"

　　Note 1: Representative Zhang is Zhang Shouyan, also known as General Li Zhaolin.
　　Note 2: Director Guan's name is Guan Huaxing.
　　Note 3: Liu Haitao was originally the commander of the First Regiment of the Third Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army.
　　Note 4: Zhang Lianke was originally the commander of the Third Regiment of the Third Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army.

　　团员
    ——记冯仲云同志和抗联同志的会见
    周洁夫
    中午的阳光射在清澈的河水上。沿着河岸，一群穿着农民服装的老头子和中年人，匆匆忙忙地赶着路。他们渡过木桥，走进挂着“珠河县马吉宁区工农联合会”木牌的篱笆门。
    这群庄稼汉都是十年前抗日联军的同志，每个人都有一段艰苦英勇的经历。当赵尚志将军、李兆麟将军、冯冲云同志先后离开珠河的时候，他们或因负伤，或因年迈，没有能够跟走。他们隐藏起自己的面目，卖工、抗活、租地种，忍受着日寇、汉奸、特务和警察的欺凌，等待着，等待着，等待着翻身的一天。十年过去了，工作队的同志到了乌吉密，他们住在穷人家里，帮助担水、扫地，和老百姓亲切的拉家常、谈国家大事，…………从他们的行为、作风和谈话的内容中，这群十年来不敢漏一点点口风的人，才向自己人吐露出“抗联”这个亲切的字眼。
    今天，他们从屯里赶到区工农联合会，就因为曾经领导他们战斗过的“老冯”要来看望他们。
    他们之中的即是最年轻的人，额上也出现了深深的皱纹。他们吸着烟草，谈论着往事——那些一闭眼睛就想起来的往事；谈说着熟悉的人——那些曾经一同在刀尖火山口出入的人；他们谈着小个子老赵，谈着方脸盘张代表（注一），谈着大胡子老冯………他们谈着，好像河水开了闸，他们谈着，好像时间倒退了十年。
    “冯主席来了！冯主席来了！”
    窗外的喊声刚落，房门就推开了，魁梧的、戴着樱色呢帽、架着黑边眼镜，大家谈论着和期待着的老冯走了进来，他便是前抗日联军第三军的领导者之一，现在松江省的主席冯仲云同志。
    五十八岁的老吕从炕上扑过来，一把拉住冯主席的胳膊：“老冯，十来多年没见了呀！”他笑，他用力拉，他的眼睛水亮。其余的人都走拢来，挤到炕前，爬上炕，围住被老吕拉到炕上的“老冯”。
    冯主席伸出手来，跟那些老战友逐一握手。他的豪迈而宏亮的声音灌进每个人的心头：“我认识你！——你，我也认识的！——就是太久了！记不起名字来了，太久了啊！”
    老吕凑过脸，仔细端详了一会冯主席，喜欢的说：“你胖了！”
    “老罗！头发也秃了”！冯主席脱下呢帽，露出秃了前额的头顶。
    “十多年了啊！”炕上炕下先后发出感慨的声音。
    “三股六、半截河子，那些老人都还在吧？”冯主席关切地问。
    “搬的搬，走的走，都换了新人罗。”
    “噢！”冯主席缩回前俯的上身，沉默了。
    抗联的同志纷纷向老冯提出自己所关切的人的名字，询问他们的下落：
    “关主任（注二）到哪去了？”
    “战死了！死在下八拉！”
    “老吴呢？”
    “是那个腰里常别着七星子的吴大麻子吗？他也牺牲了。”
    “老刘还在不在？”
    “刘海涛？”（注三）他进了关，在山东当分区司令员，后来也牺牲了。”
    “张莲壳（注四）还有吧？”
    “没有了。在铁岭殁了！——这里出去的抗联老同志，活着的不多了，十个里头死了九个。”冯主席的声调中带着追怀和感慨。
    “唉！”四围抽出长长的叹息。这些最好的战友，最亲的亲人，“十个里头死了九个”，多年的默祷暗祝落了空，人们的心头像压上了一块铅。
    门推开了，又进来两个老人，这是老杨头和老狄。老杨头是赵尚志将军最先组织的七个人中的一个，他进门就说：“我正在地里收割，听说你快来啦，我赶紧丢下庄稼跑来。见路上奔来两辆大车，我远远一瞅，就瞅出那个戴眼镜的高大个儿是你，果然！”他脱去帽子，露出短短的银发，爬上炕，坐到冯主席的左边：“后手你们怎么过的呀？”
    “那个说起来真苦哪！”冯主席轻微地摇了摇头，“一九三五年日本鬼子向我们大举进攻，烧房子并墙子，烧得真是凶呀。到了三六年，我们安不住身，老赵先走，随后老王也走了，最后我和张莲壳也离开珠河，到宾县，渡过江，经同江，奔汤原，在那里会见了赵司令和张代表，开了个会，又把下江一带人民组织起来。依兰、同江、富锦、汤原、伯力………老百姓都起来了，力量比在这里大多了。抗联的部队扩大到了十个军。可是小日本鬼子又放火烧房子了。我们活动不开，归了屯。白天不能出围子，晚上才出来摘包米，扒土豆子吃…………”
    “到了最后，日本鬼越烧越厉害，我们进了小屯，他烧小屯，我们进了大屯，他烧大屯，就这么着，他们把小屯并成大屯，把大屯并成更大的屯，烧得一个县只剩下八个大屯！咱们的部队进不去围子。”
    “可是抗联是共产党领导的队伍，哪有个投降屈服的！”
    “宁死不屈服！”几个声音同时迸出。这是旧日熟悉的战斗誓言呀！每个人都忽地抬着头来。
    “后来我们到了黑龙江，日本鬼子还是用那套办法对付我们。我们退到了北大山。呵，哪边的气候比这里冷多了！又没有粮食。夏天还好过，大伙儿摘树叶，采山菜吃——我就认识了五十二种山菜。可是秋天来了，打了霜，树叶子全枯了。大伙儿就杀马肉吃，煮马皮吃，马骨头也啃得尽尽的，别说包米盖儿，连兀拉靴都脱下来煮吃了！”
    “困难哪！”在叹息声里，有的人眼睛潮湿了。
    “五年前我在外面活动，张代表在里面指挥部队作战。他整整有五十天没沾一颗米粒，弟兄们都饿坏了，躺在地上起不来。后来我们背着粮食进来，用小米熬汤，一个一个灌他们，这才活过来。”冯主席顿住，房子里死一样地沉默。
    “冬天一到可真要了命哪！”冯主席抬一抬眼镜，接下去说：“敌人在后面进，白天得走路，在山沟里转圈，晚上没房子住，又穷，买不起帐蓬子。雪下得这么深（冯主席按了按腰部），怎么办呢？大家把雪一踩，打个雪壳子，烧起一堆火——烤火也不好受哪！火烤胸前暖，风吹背后寒，那雪风把背都刺穿啦——往雪壳子里躺算是睡觉了。就那么样也没有一天停止过战斗。”冯主席迅速地又抬了一下眼镜，阴沉的音调又转成爽朗。“好容易熬过了几个冬天，熬到了“八·一五”，苏联红军出兵，抗联的部队一夹击，日本鬼子就投降了。分散的抗联部队又扩大起来，成立了民主联军。咱们老早就说过：“我们一定要胜利！别看日本鬼子枪炮凶，将来一定要垮！”现在怎么样？过去没说错吧！小日本子终究“鳔”不过咱们，在咱们眼前献了宝！”
    注一：张代表即张寿延，亦即李兆麟将军。
    注二：关主任名关华兴。
    注三：刘海涛原为抗联第三军一团团长。
    注四：张莲壳原为抗联第三军团团长。
