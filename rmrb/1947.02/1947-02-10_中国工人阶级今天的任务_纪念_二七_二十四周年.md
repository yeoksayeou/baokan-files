The growth of the Chinese working class's strength has been truly astonishing in these twenty-four years. They have gone from strikes to armed uprisings, from semi-public political struggles to seizing political power. Of particular importance, the Chinese working class has put forward unparalleled rich experiences in the history of the Eastern—especially colonial and semi-colonial—workers' movement: how to closely rely on the peasants, relying on the peasants as the main force to fight against imperialism and feudal forces. Through their vanguard, they ensured that the peasants obtained the land they had dreamed of for thousands of years. And thousands upon thousands of peasants responded to the call of the working class with their flesh and blood, and supplied the Chinese working class with the most necessary source of strength—the living force of the army, food, and the advanced base for fighting imperialism and the feudal comprador class—the countryside. In this way, these two iron arms embraced each other and gradually crushed the ruling foundation of imperialist and feudal forces.

Not only that, but the Chinese working class and peasants have also erected a glorious banner in the storms of the past twenty years—the banner of Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of this banner, the War of Resistance was launched, and Japanese imperialism and the traitor Wang Jingwei were overthrown. Today, American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism to destroy China, and Chiang Kai-shek has replaced Wang Jingwei to be a traitor selling out China; however, today the strength of imperialism is greatly weakened compared to what the Chinese people encountered more than twenty years ago, and the consciousness and strength of the Chinese people have surpassed any previous era. The people are roaring, popular uprisings are spreading like wildfire, the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas are bravely resisting the war, and the great motherland is on the eve of a new great storm.

Faced with huge historical events, looking back on the past, we feel both unparalleled excitement and unparalleled responsibility. We can tell Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, and countless martyrs who have shed blood for the Chinese workers' movement in the past twenty-four years: the strength you built with your flesh and blood today has enough power to complete the tasks you entrusted.

So, what issues should be particularly raised before the Chinese working class meets this arduous historical task?

First, the most urgent problem in our motherland today is to liberate ourselves from the clutches of American imperialism. The influx of American goods and the monopoly of American and its comprador capital are strangling the throat of our national industry, causing workers and national capitalists to perish together. The most urgent task of the Chinese people today is to establish and consolidate a national united front against American imperialism and its running dogs. Workers and all patriotic national capitalists should work together to overcome the current national economic crisis. Therefore, on the one hand, Chinese national industrialists should take care of the workers' minimum living standards today, and actively improve their lives according to factory conditions, in order to achieve labor-capital cooperation and wage a desperate struggle against American imperialism and feudal comprador bureaucrat capital. On the other hand, workers should also try their best to overcome the crisis through labor-capital coordination and ensure joint action against the main enemy of the Chinese people—American imperialism and its running dogs.

Second, the workers' movement itself today urgently needs broad unity and coordinated action more than ever before. In other words, a broad united front against American imperialism and dictatorship should be established quickly. We hope that all workers' organizations of various political beliefs and religious factions will unite quickly and closely for the independence and liberation of the motherland and for the common interests of the working class!

Third, the most central task for workers in the Liberated Areas today is how to accomplish their assigned tasks in striving for victory in the war of defense. All workers directly and indirectly involved in military industrial production should launch a new heroic competition and fight to produce more shells, bullets, grenades, and landmines. Railway workers and various transportation workers should complete their work faster and better. All handicraft workers and employees should intensify production in a more planned way and make contributions to ensuring that the People's Liberation Army has enough food and clothing and strengthening the strength of the Liberated Areas in all aspects. Our workers and trade union organizations must also help the peasants in land reform and further consolidate the unity of workers and peasants.

In the past twenty-four years, the Chinese people and the Chinese working class have learned to unite and strengthen themselves, and have achieved many victories. Let us strive for greater and decisive victories to commemorate next year's "February 7th"!

    中国工人阶级今天的任务
    纪念“二七”二十四周年
    在这二十四年中，中国工人阶级力量成长的速度真是惊人。他们由罢工体验到武装起义，由半公开的政治斗争到掌握政权。特别重要的，中国工人阶级提出了东方——尤其是殖民地半殖民地工人运动史上无与伦比的丰富经验：如何和农民紧紧靠在一起，依靠农民这主要力量来和帝国主义封建势力斗争。他们通过了自己的先锋队，保证农民得到他们数千年来梦寐以求的土地。而千千万万的农民，就以他们的血肉响应了工人阶级的号召，并以最必要的力量源泉供给中国工人阶级——军队的有生力量、粮食，与向帝国主义与封建买办阶级搏斗的前进基地——乡村。这样两个铁的胳膊合抱起来，逐渐地碾破帝国主义封建势力的统治基础。
    不但如此，中国工人阶级与农民在二十多年来的风暴中，还树立了一面光辉的旗帜——毛泽东的旗帜。在这旗帜的领导下，抗战发动了，日本帝国主义和汉奸汪精卫被打倒了。今天，美国帝国主义却代替了日本帝国主义来灭亡中国，蒋介石代替了汪精卫来做出卖中国的汉奸；可是，今天帝国主义的力量，比起二十多年来中国人民所遭遇的是大大削弱了，中国人民的觉悟与力量却超过了以往任何一个时代。人民在怒吼，民变在燎原，解放区军民在英勇抗战，伟大的祖国正处在新的大风暴的前夜。
    面临着巨大的历史事变，回顾已往，我们一面感觉无比的兴奋，一面感觉无比的责任。我们可以向林祥谦、施洋以及二十四年来为中国工人运动流血的无数烈士们告慰，你们用血肉筑成的力量，今天已具有足够的力量完成你们交下的任务了。
    那么，中国工人阶级在迎接这艰巨的历史课题之前，有那些问题应该特别提出来的呢？
    第一，今天我们祖国最迫切的问题是从美帝国主义魔掌中解放出来。美货的充斥和美国及其买办资本的垄断，正扼断我国民族工业的喉咙，使工人与民族资本家同归于尽。中国人民今天最迫切的任务，就是建立和巩固反对美国帝国主义及其走狗的民族统一战线，工人与一切爱国的民族资本家应该携手合作，克服当前民族经济的危机。因此，今天一方面中国民族工业家应该照顾工人的最低生活水准，主动地按工厂条件提高生活，以便劳资合作，向美帝国主义与封建买办官僚资本作决死的斗争。另一方面，工人也应尽量经过劳资协调的方式，渡过危机，保证反对中国人民的主要敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗的共同行动。
    第二，工人运动本身，今天比任何时候更加急迫需要广泛的团结与协同的动作。换言之，应该迅速建立反美帝反独裁的广泛的统一战线。我们希望所有各种政治信仰及宗教帮派的工人组织，为着祖国的独立解放，为着工人阶级的共同利益，迅速和亲密地联合起来！
    第三，解放区工人今天最中心的任务，是如何达成争取保卫战争胜利中自己担当的任务。一切直接与间接参加兵工生产的工人，应该开展新英雄主义的竞赛，为多造炮弹、枪弹、手榴弹和地雷而斗争。铁路工人，各种运输工人，应该更快更好地完成工作。一切手工业工人和雇工，应该更有计划地加紧生产，为保证人民解放军的足食足衣，加强解放区各方面的力量而立功。我们的工人和工会组织，还要帮助农民的土地改革，更加巩固工人与农民的团结。
    二十四年来，中国人民中国工人阶级已学会了团结与壮大自己，并取得了很多的胜利。让我们争取更大的有决定性的胜利来纪念明年的“二七”吧！
