Jining and Daming People Protest Chiang Kai-shek's Troops' Atrocities
[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 29th dispatch] Since our Eighth Route Army annihilated two companies of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Xingfu Village, south of Jining City, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jining have become even more panicked, conscripting civilians on a large scale to repair the city and dig trenches. The masses were forced to wade in broken ice and mud, their legs and feet frozen numb. When men were not at home, women were forced to take their place, and more than 30 female laborers came from Jinpu Street. If even female laborers couldn't be provided, money had to be spent to hire someone. One laborer cost 1,500 yuan a day. The houses outside the city walls have been demolished. From the south gate west to the Yu Huang Temple soil area, and north to Chulu Nunnery, there is not a single house left. Many people have been forced to sleep in the open. An old Mr. Liu from Tushan said, "The houses that Liu Bengong (a traitor) didn't demolish, Chiang Kai-shek demolished for us. He is even worse than a traitor." All the trees inside and outside the city have been sawn down. One day, an old lady's tree was being sawn down. She pleaded with the Chiang Kai-shek's troops, "This is the material for my coffin. I am sick and dying soon. Please, officers, have mercy and leave it for me." She was kicked twice, but the tree was still sawn down. Two days later, the old lady really died, and the neighbors had to bury her in a mat. Chiang Kai-shek's troops are forcibly recruiting soldiers in Jining. First, two from each bao (group of families), then four in October, and now eight from each bao. Those who don't have people have to buy a replacement, with one soldier costing as much as 50,000 yuan. The people are complaining bitterly. The Chiang Kai-shek government's taxes are even more varied, including consolidated tax, property management tax, inheritance tax, and taxes on various industries. Second-class businesses in Jining, such as Lanfangqi, have already been taxed more than one million yuan, causing many businesses to prepare to close. Prices in Jining are soaring, and people's lives are very difficult. It costs 600-700 yuan to eat a meal, which is impossible for ordinary citizens. Everyone secretly says, "When the Eighth Route Army comes, we'll kowtow to the north." People are fleeing or resisting the atrocities. One day, two puppet soldiers went to Sunjiajing in the south of the city to collect military supplies. On the way through Zhangjiaying, they were killed by a farmer who was collecting manure. The farmer got two guns and joined the guerrillas.
[Our newspaper, Jinan, 29th dispatch] After Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied Daming County, they looted extensively, taking all the pork in the city. Liu ×× on West Street had just finished grinding wheat flour, and it was also taken away. The peanut candy seller on East Street had everything eaten up. The masses who fled from the city complained to their own government, saying, "The common people really can't live." Chiang Kai-shek's troops are grabbing soldiers everywhere. While repairing the city walls, most of the young and middle-aged men are detained. More than 80 people have already been detained at the East Gate. In Qilidian, north of Daming City, Chiang Kai-shek's troops divided all the women in the village into three categories: wives and daughters without children, young women with children, and middle-aged women in their thirties and forties, and committed rape. In the area between Weixian and Touji, Chiang Kai-shek's troops used the excuse of investigating household registration to go to the people's homes at night and arbitrarily rape and loot. In less than ten days, Xiaoyang Village was forced to pay five sheng of wheat per mu of land. In Xiaowang Village, with more than 30 households, Chiang Kai-shek's troops forcibly demanded 450,000 yuan. The masses complained bitterly, and either resisted Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities or fled to the liberated areas.

　　济宁大名人民纷抗蒋军暴行
    【本报冀鲁豫廿九日电】自从我八路军在济宁城南兴福集消灭蒋军两个连后，济宁的蒋军更加恐慌，大征民夫修城挖壕。群众被迫插足在碎冰泥水里，腿脚冻得失了知觉。要夫时若男人不在家，就要女的来替，津浦街就出了卅多个女夫，女夫也出不上的，就得花钱雇。一个夫一天要花一千五百元。城墙外的房子拆光了，从南门西到玉皇庙土山区，北到出露庵，已没有一座房子。四季春澡塘、同乐戏园等，都已变成一片瓦砾，很多人被迫露宿。土山的一位刘老先生说：“刘本功（汉奸）没拆过的房子，老蒋都给咱拆了，他真比汉奸还坏。”城里城外的树都锯光了，一天要锯一位老太太的树，她哀告蒋军说：“这是我的棺材料、我病的快要死了，老总们行好给我留下吧。”她挨了两脚，树还是锯了。过了两天这位老太太真的死了，街坊只得用席埋葬了她。蒋军在济宁强迫要兵，先是每保两个，十月里每保四个，现在则是每保八个，没有人的得花钱买，一个兵贵到五万元，人民叫苦连天。蒋政府的捐税，更是五花八门，有统税、管业税、所得遗产税，以及各行业的税。济宁的二等买卖，像兰芳齐，即已捐到百多万元，弄得很多商家都准备关门。济宁市物价高涨，人民生活非常困难，吃顿饭要花六七百元，一般市民都没法过。大家都暗说：“八路军来了朝北瞌头。”人民纷纷往外逃或抗拒暴行，某日两个伪军到城南孙家井去催军，路过张家营，被一个拾粪的农民，将他两打死。这个农民得了两支枪，参加了游击队。
    【本报冀南二十九日电】蒋军侵占大名县城后大肆抢掠，把全城的猪肉都抢光了，西大街刘××刚推好麦子面也给抢去，东大街卖糖花生的被他们吃光。纵城内逃出之群众向自己政府哭诉着说：“老百姓真没法过了。”蒋军到处抓兵，在修城墙时，青壮年多扣起来，东门口已扣了八十多个。大名城北七里店，蒋军把全村妇女分成没有孩子的媳妇闺女，有小孩的青年妇女及三四十岁的中年妇女三等，进行奸淫。在魏县与头集进一带，蒋军以调查户口为名，夜里不时上门，任意到老百姓家奸淫抢掠。不到十天，小杨庄每亩地已要到五升麦子，三十余户的小王庄，蒋军强要四十五万元，群众叫苦连天，纷纷抗蒋暴行或逃往解放区。
