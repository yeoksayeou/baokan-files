    【Reported from Taiyue on the 6th of this month】Yesterday, during the Lantern Festival, various places in Taiyue held meetings to support the army, support the government, and love the people. In Yangcheng, in addition to meetings held in various districts, a 3,000-person meeting was held in the city. Liberated men and women wore new clothes and showed joyful expressions. Many military dependents rode donkeys from three hundred li away to attend. More than ten Yangko dance teams performed programs such as the struggle for liberation, getting rich through labor, and "Attacking Lingshi City" amidst the sounds of gongs and drums. After the meeting, Director Niu of the Administrative Office delivered a speech, in which he put forward two appeals: First, we must pay attention to the issue of military dependents while leveling out and making up for deficiencies. After the military dependents of landlord status are purged, we must help solve their difficulties in production; we must also help military martyrs' families and honorably discharged soldiers who have been allocated land to solve difficulties in production such as fertilizer, farm tools, and livestock, and encourage them to participate in mutual aid. Second, in order to support the self-defense war, we must do a good job in combining logistics and production to ensure the supply of the troops at the front. Director Gui of the Military Region called on the troops to defend the Taiyue area and protect the fruits of the masses' liberation. The rear troops should also engage in their own production to reduce the burden on the people. The liberation hero Bi Jinchuan said: "When drinking water, don't forget the well digger; when liberated, don't forget the Eighth Route Army. We must support the army, comfort the army, and give preferential treatment to military dependents." Mr. Li Hengnian, a representative of military dependents, said in his speech: "Last year, the government lent me 40,000 yuan for production, which allowed me to earn four shi of millet and enabled me to start a family and get rich. I will definitely tell my son to fight well and defend this good time."

    太岳各界元宵举行拥爱大会
    【本报太岳六日电】昨日元宵节，太岳各地纷纷召开拥军拥政爱民大会。阳城除各区分别召开外，城内开了三千人的大会，翻身男女身着新衣面露喜色，有不少军属骑着毛驴从三千里外赶来。十余伙秧歌队，在锣鼓喧天中表演着翻身斗争，劳动发财及“攻打灵石城”等节目。开会后首由行署牛主任致词，他提出两点号召：第一、要在填平补齐中注意军属问题，地主成份的军属被清算后，要在生产中帮助解决困难；分到土地的军烈属及荣退军人，还要帮助解决生产中的肥料农具牲口等困难，吸收其参加互助。第二、为支援自卫战争，一定要做好后勤与生产的结合，保证部队前线的供给。军区桂主任号召部队保卫太岳区，保卫群众翻身果实，后方部队还要自己生产减轻人民负担。翻身英雄毕金川说：“吃水不忘掏井人，翻身不忘八路军，要拥军劳军优待军属”。军属代表李恒年先生讲话，他说：“去年政府贷给我四万块钱生产，叫我赚了四石小米，使我起家发财，可要叫我儿好好打仗，保卫这好时光”。
