　　Murderers Cannot Escape the Punishment of the People
　　Taihang Branch
　　During our forced capture of Wen County last December, Kuomintang secret agents and black gun leaders Zhou and Ren Shu'an, who had escaped the net, were annihilated by our army in Zhugou Village, Wen County, during this year's Wen County campaign, greatly inspiring the people. After the Japanese surrender two years ago, when our army liberated Wen County, Zhou and others hid in the Zhangqiang area. On the night of October 18th of this year, they assassinated our district chief and deputy chief, Li Yan and Liu Hongjiang, as well as comrade Li Zhaomin, a civil education assistant. Only when the local masses, under the leadership of the democratic government, launched a movement against local bullies and black guns, were Zhou and others unable to hide any longer and fled to Xinxiang.

　　After Chiang's army occupied Wen County last year, Zhou and other lackeys followed their masters back to Wen County and formed an assassination squad, entrenched in the Zhangqiang Village area of the Third District, carrying out assassination activities. Because Zhou and others robbed along the road during the day and shot people with black guns at night, they created a "black world" in the Zhangqiang area where roads were cut off and people were scarce. Since last winter, they have even helped the vicious landlords carry out retaliatory actions, and the masses hate them to the bone.

　　On the night of January 22nd, when our army attacked Wen County, Zhou's black gun group of fourteen people had just come out of the city and arrived at Zhugou to take on the outer perimeter guard duty. They were gathered in the house, warming themselves by the fire, when our army was advancing towards Wen County city in the snow. They heard someone inside and wanted to go in to find a guide. The enemy immediately opened fire. Our army quickly surrounded the house, climbed onto the roof, and attacked with grenades. But the enemy still refused to surrender. Under the anger of our army, they were bombarded with grenades, killing seven enemies, including Zhou Tie, in the house. Ren Shu'an and five others were about to break through the fire and escape, but they were also seized by us. Only two people escaped with injuries during the battle.

　　The next day, the second day of the Lunar New Year, our army captured Wen County. After the democratic government sentenced Ren and others to death, the proclamation stated: "Murderous criminals, even if they escape to the ends of the earth, cannot escape from the hands of the people."

　　杀人犯逃不了人民惩处
    太行分社
    去年十二月，我强攻温县时漏网的国民党特务黑枪头子周逆、任述安等，在此次年来温县战役中，已被我军歼灭于该县朱沟村，人心极为振奋。前年日本投降，我军解放温县后，周等即潜藏张羌一带，于本年十月十八日夜，暗杀我正副区长栗筵、刘鸿江，民教助理员李兆民等同志。就在当地群众在民主政府领导下，展开反恶霸、黑枪运动，周逆等再也无法藏身，才逃到新乡。
    蒋军于去年侵占温县后，周逆等走狗，便尾随其主人返回温县，结成暗杀队，盘踞在三区张羌村一带，进行暗杀活动。由于周逆等白天沿路寻劫，晚上黑枪打人，造成了张羌一带路断人稀的“黑世界”。去冬以来，更帮凶恶的地主实行倒算，群众莫不恨之入骨。
    一月二十二日夜，我军攻击温县时，周逆黑枪集团十四人，刚由城内出来进至朱沟担负外围警戒。正团聚屋内烘火卿天之际。我军正冒雪向温县城挺进，听到屋内有人，要进去找向导，敌即开枪射击，我军即迅速包围，登上屋顶，以手榴弹轰击。但敌仍不肯缴枪，在我军激愤下，当以手榴弹将周铁等七敌炸死于屋内；任述安等五人正要突出火网逃走，这时也被我扭住，战斗中，仅两人带伤逃走。
    第二天，大年初二，我军攻克了温县城，民主政府在判处任逆等死刑后。布告上写着：“杀人凶犯们，既使逃到天涯海角，也逃不出人民手中。”
