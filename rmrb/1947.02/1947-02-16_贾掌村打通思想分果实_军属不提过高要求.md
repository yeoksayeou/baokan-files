　　[Our Newspaper Taihang Fourteenth Dispatch] In the land redistribution movement, various localities are paying attention to taking care of military dependents and assisting honorably discharged soldiers in establishing homes. In the Twelve Streets outside Shagoumen, Wuan City, there are 46 military dependent households. Because the street is relatively poor, the masses were not able to provide sufficient care to the military dependents, so the wealthier streets distributed 600,000 yuan in kind to the military dependents in the Twelve Streets. The military dependents of the street used 450,000 yuan to form a military dependents' cotton workshop (cotton ginning and carding), which earned more than 460,000 yuan in just over fifty days. In order to take care of and improve the relationship between honorably discharged soldiers and cadres and the masses, the Third District of Wuxiang specifically convened a meeting of honorably discharged soldiers and discussed five measures: (1) Distribute land according to production and grain according to population, and distribute goods according to need. (2) Give special consideration to those who settle in this county from other counties. (3) Give special preferential treatment to the old, weak, and disabled. (4) Honorably discharged soldiers must not be special. (5) Absorb honorably discharged soldiers to participate in the land reform and evaluation committees. When Jiazhang Village in Changzhi distributed the fruits of the revolution, some military dependents made excessive demands, with the mentality of "planting trees for shade and raising children to guard against old age" of relying on past contributions. After discovering this, the case of Gui Shun's father starving to death during a famine when Gui Shun was away serving, was used to resolve everyone's ideological problems, and they no longer made excessive demands, and model military dependents were selected to participate in the evaluation committee.

　　贾掌村打通思想分果实
    军属不提过高要求
    【本报太行十四日电】各地填补运动中注意照顾军属，并帮助荣退军人建家。武安城沙沟门外十二街，有军属四十六户，因该街较穷，群众对军属照顾不过来，较富的街分给十二街军属果实洋六十万元。该街军属用四十五万元，组或一个军属花坊（弹花、轧花），五十余天即赚洋四十六万余元。武乡三区为了照顾及改善荣退军人与干群关系，专门召开了荣退军人会，讨论了五项办法：（一）按产粮分地，按人口分粮，按需用分东西。（二）外县在本县安家者特别照顾。（三）老弱残废者特别优待。（四）荣退军人决不特殊。（五）吸收荣退军人参加翻身与评议委员会。长治贾掌村在分果实时，部分军属提出过高要求，存在有“栽树为歇凉，养儿防备老”的居功思想。发现后以贵顺在家时荒年他爹饿死的实例，打通了大家思想，不再提过高要求，并选出模范军属参加评议会。
