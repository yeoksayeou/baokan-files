　　Changzi Second District Eight Cadres
    Conserve Their Entire Year's Supply
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] All cadres in the Second District of Changzi, in the midst of enthusiastic discussions about production and conservation to support the front lines, unanimously agreed that without victory at the front, nothing else could be discussed. When researching individual conservation plans, Comrades Yang Jinhe and Feng Zhijun took the initiative to propose: handing over all of this year's supply to the Party to support the war, and resolving all difficulties themselves. Moved by their spirit of wholeheartedly working for the Party, Farm Association Director Li Guichang, Deputy District Head Yang Qingwen, and Zhao Dongxi, Li Yuancheng, Guo Shouyi, and three other comrades also eagerly proposed to conserve their entire year's supply. Comrades with more difficult family situations also proposed to provide their own clothing. The entire district, with a total of twenty-six cadres, can save 900,000 yuan by the end of the year. Everyone is also preparing to implement this spirit among the masses, and strive, after this year's election, for all village government cadres to switch to not separating from production, in order to reduce the burden on the masses, and to overcome the difficulties of office expenses by cultivating some land themselves.

　　长子二区八干部
    节约全年供给
    【本报讯】长子二区全体干部在热烈讨论生产节约支援前线中，一致认为没有前线胜利，一切都无从谈起。在研究个人节约计划时，杨金和、冯智俊二同志首先自动提出：今年供给全部交党以支持战争，一切困难自己动手解决。在他们全心全意为党工作的精神感动下，又有农会主任李贵长、副区长杨清文及赵东喜、李元成、郭守义等六同志也争先提出全部节约今年供给。家庭较困难的同志，亦提出衣服自给。全区共计二十六个干部到年底可节约九十万元。大家并准备将这精神贯彻到群众中去，争取今年民选后，村政权干部全部改为不脱离生产的，以减轻群众负担，由自己种些地克服办公费的困难。
