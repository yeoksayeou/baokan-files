    Note: From July to December of last year, our army annihilated nearly 110,000 enemies in self-defense counterattacks. This January alone, our army annihilated over 61,000 enemies, approximately two-thirds of the number annihilated in the last half of the year. Regarding the capture and recovery of county towns, a total of 18 county towns were captured and recovered in the last half of the year, while this month alone, 19 county towns were captured and recovered, exceeding the total number in the last half of last year. Based on the above two comparisons, it is evident that the Chiang army's fighting will and combat effectiveness are declining daily, while our army is becoming stronger with each battle.

　　军区司令部公布全区元月份战绩
    歼敌六万余克城十九座
    证明我军益强敌力日衰
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区司令部顷发表第四号作战公报，公布一九四七年元月份战绩如次：
    （一）攻克与收复县城十九座——翼城、巨野、嘉祥、临漳、聊城、濮县、涡阳、定陶、城武、单县、范县、曹县、观城、清丰、温县、南乐、灵石、柘城、太康（以上顺序按收复时间排列）。
    （二）歼蒋、阎正规军十五个半团，其番号为六十八师二四一团，五十五师二二○团，五四三团等全部，七十师一四○旅旅直及二八○团全部，二七九团大部，八十八师六十三团一八六团全部，一八四团两个营，五十八师二十九团一个营，三十团两个营。阎军六十九师二○五团二○六团全部，暂四十四师、暂四十五师、暂四十六师、七十一师、七十二师、七十三师各一部，八总队、九总队各一部，暂三十九师两个营。并毙伤正规军九千七百人，生俘一四○旅旅长谢懋权、团长周觉、阎军六十九师副师长王熙明以下官兵两万四千八百余人。
    （三）歼顽伪地方团队及政府人员，计九个保安团——国防部保安第三纵队张岚峰部第一总队第一团、第二团，第二总队第四团、第三团等全部，第三总队第六团一个营，山东保安旅孙性斋部两个团，巨野定陶保安团，阎保安第六团两个营。十一个县政府——郓城、寿张、阳谷、汶上、巨野、灵石、翼城、定陶、曹县、单县、城武。七个县的警察队（郓城、汶上、巨野、定陶、曹县、单县、城武），三个县的还乡团（郓城、沁水、翼城）。毙伤团长石佛起以下官兵五千六百七十四人，生俘伪国防部保安第三纵队司令官张岚峰以下官兵二万一千七百十人。
    总计毙伤俘顽正规军与杂顽六万一千二百七十四人。
    （四）缴炮二十二门，战防炮二门，迫击炮八十六门，小炮、掷弹筒三百四十四门。
    （五）缴重机枪一百五十八挺，轻机枪一千一百三十二挺。
    （六）缴步马枪一万九千四百一十六支。
    （七）缴各种子弹五十万发，各种炮弹四千余发。
    （八）缴汽车一十八辆。
    （九）其他军用品甚多。
    按：去年七月份至十二月份我军在自卫反击中共歼敌近十一万人，而今年元月一个月中我军则歼敌六万一千余人，约为去年半年歼敌数字之二分之一强。在攻克与收复县城上，去年半年共计攻克与收复县城十八座，而今年一个月则攻克与收复县城十九座，超过去年后半年的总数。根据以上两点对比，很明显的证明了蒋军战斗意志，战斗力已日益衰败，而我军则愈战愈强。（二月十日）
