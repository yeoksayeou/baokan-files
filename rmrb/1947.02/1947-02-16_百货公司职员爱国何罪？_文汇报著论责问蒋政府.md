Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 14th: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an editorial on the 10th, denouncing the Kuomintang secret agents for disrupting the patriotic rally in Shanghai on the 9th and the atrocities of beating patriotic people. It stated: "We are wondering what kind of world this is, that loving domestic goods has become a heinous crime. Then aren't those who want to live all damned criminals?" It continued: "Loving domestic goods and boycotting American goods are two sides of the same coin. To love domestic goods, one must boycott American goods. Those who claim to love domestic goods but oppose boycotting American goods are deliberately opposing the love of domestic goods and are deliberately acting as compradores for American goods. Today, the industrial and commercial sectors are at a critical juncture for their own survival and for the survival of the people of the whole country. They stand up in response to this call, and receive a 'no' verdict, being beaten to injury and even death. Tell me, is there any right or wrong? What kind of world is this becoming? This is not only a question of whether or not there is democracy, but a question of whether or not to be patriotic, a question of whether or not to live on; it is not only a question for the industrial and commercial sectors, but a question for the people of the whole country, a question of whether or not the people of the whole country want to be patriotic, want to live on. Mr. Liang Renda's life is gone, and the blood of dozens of injured people should further illuminate the path we should take." The newspaper reported on the same day, describing the events of the atrocity that day: Over a hundred people were beaten and injured. The thugs carried iron rulers and wooden sticks. After the assault, one of them, holding a handgun, directed the group to leave in formation. Afterwards, in addition to those who sought medical attention themselves, 19 injured people were taken to the Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau. Liang Renda, who was seriously injured, died at Renji Hospital at 4:40 pm. He leaves behind an elderly mother and a frail wife. His wife is five months pregnant, and upon hearing this tragic news, she has become mentally unstable.

　　百货公司职员爱国何罪？
    文汇报著论责问蒋政府
    【新华社延安十四日电】沪文汇报于十日发表社评，痛斥国民党特务捣乱九日沪市爱国集会，殴打爱国人士暴行内称：“我们奇怪现在究竟是‘什么世界，爱用国货既成了大逆不道，那么要活命的人不都是该死的罪人吗？’继称：‘爱用国货与抵制美货是一件事情的两方面，爱用国货就必须抵制美货，要是口称爱用国货而反对抵制美货的，就是存心反对爱用国货，存心做美货的买办。今天工商界为自己生死存亡关头，为全国人民生死存亡关头。站起来响应这号召，而得了一个‘非是’的罪命，挨打至于伤，至于死，试问还有是非没有？还成个什么世界？这不仅是要不要民主的问题，而是要不要爱国的问题，要不要活下去的问题；不仅是工商界的问题，而是全国人民的问题，是全国人民要不要爱国，要不要活下去的问题。梁仁达君生命以亡，数十位受伤者的血，应该更照彻我们应走的道路”。该报同日消息报导：当日暴行经过称：被殴伤者及挨打者百余人，暴徒带有铁尺、木棍。行凶毕，其中一执手枪者，指挥结队而去。事后，受伤者除自行投医者外，为沪警局黄浦分局带去十九名，至伤重之梁仁达于午后四时四十分，死于仁济医院，彼现遗有老母及弱妻，妻已怀孕五月，闻此噩耗，已神智失常。
