    Gleanings from the Student Patriotic Movement
    During a parade at Nanjing's Jinling University, students imitated the "Down with the Imperialists" song, creating a "Yankee Soldiers Go Home" song. One verse went: "Go home quickly! Go home quickly! American soldiers! American soldiers! Your wife is calling you, your children are shouting for you; Go home quickly! Go home quickly!"
    Eighty professors at Peiping's Sino-French University posted a notice during a student parade stating: We fully agree with the resolutions of the "Committee for Protesting Atrocities," your opinions are our opinions.
    During a student parade in Peiping, rickshaw pullers also joined the marching ranks in droves. Alumni of Peking University, upon learning of the march's departure, automatically rushed to Dongdan Training Ground to boil water for supply.
    Students at Shanghai's Great China University decided to participate in the New Year's Day parade in Shanghai, but were prevented by school authorities. The president said: "What's the use of protesting?" The Dean of Students said the rape incident was "complicated." The "Autonomous Association," established under the "commission" of the school authorities, was initially forced to send people to contact various schools in Shanghai to prepare for joint action under the firm demands of the vast majority of students. However, when the teams from various schools appeared on the streets, the Great China University "Autonomous Association" deliberately did not notify the students, causing them all to fail to participate. Public sentiment was indignant, and the representatives of the "Autonomous Association" were severely criticized, who were considered to have disgraced the school's reputation. Afterwards, a student from Great China University wrote a letter to Wenhui News saying: "The students of Great China University will one day break out of their cages and call out their voices!"
    Students at Peiping's China University sent a letter to the press on New Year's Day, stating that they were extremely "saddened" that they were unable to participate in the parade due to pressure from the authorities. They pointed out that the more than 200 "certain elements" sent by the school authorities to disrupt the parade could not represent the more than 3,000 students of China University. They also stated that even in China University, which is known as the "reactionary base camp of the Peiping student circle," democratic forces still prevail. The fact that only more than 200 people out of more than 3,000 students participated in the disruptive team is clear evidence.
    The principal of the Shanghai Sports College used the words "I guarantee with my head one hundred percent that there will be trouble during the parade" to intimidate the students, and asked the marching students to write "guarantees" or similar "written statements" to the Dean of Students. It is said: "This move is a matter of life and death, and the school cannot bear the responsibility."
    On the 29th of last month, more than 200 disguised student spies, instigated by the Kuomintang authorities, entered Peking University to make trouble. While tearing and fighting, they asked each other: "How's it going?" The answer was: "Fifty thousand yuan!" They held a meeting on the spot. When the "chairman" called "Fu Jen University," no one responded. The "chairman" panicked and said: "Old Wang! Aren't you from Fu Jen?" Old Wang suddenly realized and hurriedly replied: "Fu Jen is here! Fu Jen is here!" There were occasional quarrels in the audience, and someone immediately shouted: "Comrades, don't misunderstand!"

    学生爱国运动拾零
    南京金陵大学游行时，仿“打倒列强”作成“美军快滚蛋”歌，其中一首为“赶快回去！赶快回去！美国兵！美国兵！你的老婆唤你，你的娃子喊你；快回去！快回去！”
    北平中法大学的八十个教授在学生游行时贴出布告说：我们完全同意“抗议暴行委员会”的决议，你们的意见就是我们的意见。
    平市学生游行时，三轮车夫也成群加入游行行列。北大校友得悉队伍出发消息，自动赶来东单教练场烧开水供应。
    上海大夏大学学生决定参加元旦上海游行，受到学校当局阻止。校长说：“抗议何用？”训导长说：强奸事情“复杂”。在校方“委任”下成立之“自治会”，初虽在最大多数同学坚决要求下，被迫派遣人联络沪市各校，准备一致行动；但当各校队伍出现街头时，大夏“自治会”故意不通知同学，致均未能参加，群情愤慨，对“自治会”代表痛加责难，认为有辱校誉。事后大夏一学生投书文汇报称：“大夏学生总有一天冲出笼子，呼唤出他们的声音！”
    北平中国大学学生于元旦致书报界，声明在当局压迫下未能参加游行，异常“难过”。指出该校当局派出捣乱游行之二百多“某种分子”并不能代表三千余学生的中大。并称：即在这号称“北平学生界反动大本营”的中国大学，也还是民主势力占优势，三千余学生中只二百多人参加捣乱队伍就是明证。
    上海市体育专科学校校长以“百分之百的拿头颅来担保游行时要出乱子”的话来恐吓学生，并要游行学生向训导处写出“保证书”之类的“字据”。据称：“此举因系性命攸关，学校难负其责。”
    上月二十九日，国民党当局唆使下进入北大捣乱之二百余伪装学生的特务，一边撕打，一边相互问：“怎么样？”回答：“五万元！”他们当场举行集会，点名时“主席”叫至“辅仁大学”无人应，“主席”慌了，说：“老汪！你不是辅仁吗？”老汪恍然大悟，急答曰：“辅仁有！辅仁有！”台下偶有争吵，有人即喊：“同志，不要误会！”
