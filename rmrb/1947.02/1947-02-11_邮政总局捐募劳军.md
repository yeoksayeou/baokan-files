    Post Office Headquarters Donates to Comfort Troops
    [This newspaper report] The Post Office Headquarters recently studied the current situation, and their confidence in victory is even higher. Recently, they resolved to work actively and support the front lines, and enthusiastically donated money to comfort the front lines. The entire organization of twenty-eight people donated sixteen towels, twelve bars of soap, over 1,800 yuan in silver dollars, as well as toothpaste, socks, and twenty accompanying letters of appreciation. A young staff member who had been working for less than a year also enthusiastically wrote a letter. The items were all placed in comfort bags made by each person, and written in red and green colors were the words "Presented to the comrades who are fighting for the motherland," and "Wishing the people's heroes constant victory," and other words.

    邮政总局捐募劳军
    【本报讯】邮务总局最近学习时事，胜利信心更高，最近决心积极工作，支援前方，并热烈捐款慰劳前方。全机关二十八人，捐出毛巾十六条，肥皂十二条，大洋一千八百余元，及牙粉、袜子等带附慰问信二十封。一个参加工作不满周年的小鬼也热情的写了信，物品都装在各人做的慰问袋里，并用红红绿绿的颜色写着“赠给为祖国而战的战友们”，及“祝人民英雄们常胜”等话。（李启艳）
