(Reported from Southern Hebei, 14th) With the help of the democratic government, river transport in Hengshui has developed unprecedentedly. Hengshui is a port on the lower reaches of the Fuyang River, a distribution center for imported goods and local products. Before the war, during the Kuomintang's rule, merchant ships were often robbed by bandits, officials and soldiers requisitioned labor, and the government imposed exorbitant taxes, leading to the depression of river transport. During the Anti-Japanese War, river transport came to a complete standstill due to the destruction of ships and the silting of waterways by the Japanese invaders, and boatmen and porters all lost their jobs. After Hengshui was liberated the year before last, the democratic government organized porters and helped the masses repair ships and dredge rivers, issuing clear orders to protect ships and strictly prohibit extortion at all ferry crossings. By March of last year, 300 small ferries and fishing boats were traveling to and from Tianjin to transport grain and salt. With a freight rate of four yuan per catty and a load of 80,000 catties, a profit of 320,000 yuan could be made. Many boats staying in Tianjin and other places came one after another. As of now, there are 40 large ships with a load of 80,000 catties, 25 with a load of 40,000 catties, 15 with a load of 10,000 to 20,000 catties, and 35 fishing boats, with a total of 487 boatmen. To facilitate business transactions, the government also organized exchanges to be responsible for transaction procedures. According to one day's statistics, 400,000 catties of coarse salt alone were traded. After the outbreak of the civil war, river transport was blockaded by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, causing great difficulties. In order to take care of the boatmen's livelihood, the government organized the transfer of homespun cloth, grain, salt, charcoal, pottery and porcelain between Central Hebei and Southern Hebei. The ×× Freight Yard alone transported 174,000 catties of charcoal and 62,000 catties of pottery and porcelain from the wharf in two months, shipping about 50,000 catties of charcoal and pottery to Central Hebei. Zhang Caozhong and three others jointly transported goods, earning more than 80,000 yuan in silver each in three months. Cui Yu's family of seven only had a small seven-zhang long boat, earning more than 200,000 yuan a year. He said happily: "I am like a farmer who has good land, and I have turned over." Due to the development of river transport, the number of freight yards (transporting cotton and grain) in Hengshui has increased from six to twenty-four, the number of pottery and porcelain businesses has increased from five to sixteen, the number of coal businesses has increased from eight to sixteen, and the number of shopkeepers has increased from more than 280 to more than 491.

　　千余船只运销土产
    衡水河运空前发展
    【本报冀南十四日电】民主政府帮助下，衡水河运空前发展。衡水是滏阳河下游一个码头，是外来物品与内地土产集散地。战前国民党统治时代，商船经常遭土匪抢劫，官兵抓差，加上政府横征暴敛，河运萧条。抗战期间，因日寇破坏船只，河道淤塞，河运更完全停顿，船民脚行全部失业。前年衡水解放后，民主政府一面组织脚行，一面帮助群众修船浚河，明令保护船只、严禁各渡口勒索。至去年三月，即有三百只小摆渡和渔船来往天津运输粮盐。每斤货四元脚力，载重八万斤就能得卅二万元。很多停留天津等地的船便纷纷驶来。截至目前已有载重八万斤的大船四十只，载重四万斤的二十五只，载重一、二万斤的十五只，渔船三十五只。船民四百八十七人。为便利生意成交，政府又组织交易所，负责成交手续。据某日一天统计，仅大盐成交四十万斤。内战暴发后，河运遭蒋军封锁，大感困难。政府为照顾船家生活，乃组织冀中与冀南的土布粮食盐炭缸碗等调济。××货栈两个月即由码头运炭十七万四千斤，缸碗六万二千斤，输往冀中炭碗约五万斤。张曹中等四人合伙运货，三月内每人赚洋八万多元。崔玉家七口人，只有一只七丈长的小船，一年挣二十多万元。他高兴的说：“我也像庄户人有了好地一样，翻了身了。”由于河运发展，衡水货栈业（运输棉粮）也由六家增到二十四家，缸碗业由五家增到十六家，煤炭业由八家增到十六家，铺商由二百八十余家增到四百九十一家。
