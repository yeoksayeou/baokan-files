Sima Village Cadre Activists
	Overcome Meritorious Thinking
	Rationally Distribute the Fruits

[This Newspaper Despatch] In the distribution of the fruits of struggle in Sima Village, Changzhi, the cadres' meritorious thinking was very serious, and they all wanted to take a larger share. After the distribution, they still expressed dissatisfaction. For example, the village deputy took a pair of trousers allotted to him at the evaluation meeting and said, "This is how the common people see us; they never see us getting up early and working late." As a result, many village cadres were in low spirits, thinking that they had contributed to the struggle under the leadership, but could not speak up when it came to distributing the fruits. The next day, all the village cadres held a meeting to examine themselves and reflect on their thinking. When discussing "Who is the struggle ultimately for?", the chairman of the farmers' association said, "Yesterday afternoon, the evaluators gave a satin mattress to the one who was elected, but didn't give me one. The two of us started arguing. Now that I think about it, it's really wrong. I was only thinking about myself and forgot about the masses." Then he added, "Now I want to make up for the shortfall just this once. Today, we should help the backward masses to thoroughly turn themselves over." Tian Shui, the director of public security, said, "I wanted a red quilt so I could get married later, but what I want, the masses also want. As cadres, we shout slogans every day about leading the masses to turn themselves over, but when it comes to things, we forget about the masses. I realize this is very detached from the masses." After the self-criticism, all nineteen cadres said that in the past, when distributing the fruits, the cadres took the good things and forgot about the masses. Since they struggled together with the masses, they should turn themselves over together. One person for everyone, and everyone for one person. The distribution of the fruits must be evaluated fairly by the common people. If the cadres plan for every household, the masses will have no complaints about the cadres.

[Another Despatch] In the distribution of the fruits of struggle in Beidong Village, Changzhi, the village cadres combined self-reflection with the masses' evaluation of the models of liberation, overcoming the cadres' meritorious thinking, praising the cadres' contributions, and deeply mobilizing the backward masses. When the village distributed the fruits, some cadres thought that they had worked hard all winter and had special ideas, wanting to take a larger share. If they didn't get it, they became passive. The leadership promptly carried out education, first convening a meeting of cadres and activists to let everyone talk about their thoughts and feelings, and to raise their feelings about the distribution of the fruits. Everyone poured out their thoughts. Du Qiaocheng said, "I thought I had been busy all winter, getting up early and working late, and I couldn't get a bigger share. I was very unhappy in my heart, thinking it would be better to be a carpenter and earn more money." Everyone said, "When I went home, my five brothers and two sisters all said to me, 'What have you gotten from being so active every day? Isn't selling charcoal twice as profitable as a few hundred yuan?!'" At this point, everyone was asked to discuss, what is the struggle for? Is it worth it to calculate gains and losses? ×× said that in the past, even if he wasn't a cadre and didn't delay work, but his two brothers worked as long-term and short-term laborers, they suffered all year round and could not make a living. Now they have houses to live in and land to cultivate, and the grain they harvest is enough to eat, and they are no longer oppressed. After the initial breakthrough in thinking, the village launched a campaign among the masses to commend and elect models, selecting forty-three male and female heroes. Everyone's spirits were high, and they further discussed how to thoroughly overthrow the landlords and completely liberate themselves.

　　司马村干部积极分子
    打破居功思想
    合理分配果实
    【本报讯】长治司马村在分果实中，干部居功思想很严重，都想多分了东西，分过后，还表示不满足。如村副在评议会上拿着分给自己的一条裤子说：“这就是老百姓看见咱啦，起早搭黑倒是看不见”。不少村干因此情绪很低落，都以为领导斗争有功，分果实时反到不能说话。次日全村干部开会检讨，并作思想反省。讨论“斗争究竟是为了谁”时，农会主席说：“昨天下午评议员给了有评议上玻璃缎褥子，没给我分上，我们二人便吵起架来，现在检讨起来，实在不对，光为自己打算，忘了群众。”接着又说：“现在我想填平补齐就这一次啦，今天应该帮助落后群众彻底翻身。”公安主任天水说：“我想分上条红被子，以后好结个婚，但是咱想要的东西，群众也想要，当干部每天口口声声喊领导群众翻身，但遇到东西就忘了群众，我检讨这事情是很脱离群众的”。检讨后，十九个干部都说，过去分果实，干部分好的，忘了群众，和群众共同斗争，应该共同翻身，一人为大家，大家为一人。分果实中一定要叫老百姓评议公道，干部为家家打算，群众对干部也就没有什么意见了。
    【又讯】长治北董村分果实中，村干部反省与群众评选翻身模范结合，克服了干部的居功思想，又表扬了干部功劳，并深入发动了落后群众。该村分果实时，有部分干部以为起早搭黑干了一冬天，抱着特殊思想，想多分果实，分不到便消极了。领导上抓紧进行教育，首先召开干部积极分子会议，让大家谈心思话，提出分果实的感觉，各人都把心思话倾吐出来，杜巧成说：“我心想起早搭黑忙了一冬天，还不能多分，心中非常不高兴，心想还不如当木匠挣钱多”。大家说：“我回到家兄弟五个、姐妹两个都说我，天天积极分到了什么？卖两次炭还不挣几百块钱？！”这时便让大家讨论，斗争为什？算计是否吃亏？××说，过去不当干部，也不误工，但兄弟二人作长工打短工，受一年罪连年也没法过。现在有房住有地种，打的粮食满够吃，也不受人压迫了。初步思想打通后，又在群众中展开表扬评选模范，选出男女英雄四十三人，大家情绪高涨，进一步讨论如何彻底斗倒地主翻透身。
