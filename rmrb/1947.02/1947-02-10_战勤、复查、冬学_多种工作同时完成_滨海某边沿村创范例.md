Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th. A certain village on the edge of a city in the Shuhe District of Binhai has created a model for completing multiple tasks simultaneously, including wartime support for the front lines, re-examination, anti-traitor activities, and winter study. The village first established a Front Support Land Re-examination Committee, led by the village peasant association and with the participation of various mass organizations, to provide unified leadership. Underneath it were set up a porter association, stretcher team, cart team, donkey team, laundry group, caretaking group, and re-examination group. The members of the Front Support Committee also served as team leaders of the various groups, and the remaining members were assigned to the groups as core members. This organization also served as a winter study group, with the front support team leader as the natural study group leader, under the unified leadership of the Re-examination Committee. The content included discussions such as "Who are we supporting the front lines for?", "Are there any little Chiang Kai-sheks in the village?", and "Is the emancipation of the poor complete?". As a result, informal schools sprung up everywhere. When porters were needed, the committee assigned them to various groups according to their labor power. Those who stayed at home continued the re-examination, especially mobilizing women and the elderly to participate. Those who worked outside also participated in the work when they returned in the evening. If they could not hold meetings during the day, they held them at night. If there were troops stationed in the house, they held meetings outside. When the whole village, young and old, discussed "Are there any little Chiang Kai-sheks in the village?", they discovered hidden murderers, special agent landlords, and other criminal activities. From this, a mass anti-traitor exposure movement was launched, and in the winter study, three lackeys were educated and reformed, and they all came to fight against the despotic landlord. As a result, the masses' enthusiasm was greatly aroused, with eleven young people joining the militia, more than sixty peasants joining mass organizations, demanding old contracts back from the landlords, and measuring the land. In the gaps between supporting the front, the re-examination was completed in seven days. This news further encouraged the porters from this village serving on the front lines. After the re-examination, various groups stepped forward, determined to protect the land and their homes. The old men formed "Guiding Teams", and the women formed "Sewing Clothes" and "Making Pancakes Teams". All kinds of work were very active.

    战勤、复查、冬学
    多种工作同时完成
    滨海某边沿村创范例
    【新华社山东四日电】滨海某城沭河区边沿某村，创造了战时支援前线、复查、反奸、冬学等多种工作一齐完成的范例。该村首先以村农救会为主，吸收各群众团体参加，成立支前土地复查委员会，统一领导，下设民夫会、担架队、大车队、驴子队、洗衣组、看护组、复查组，支前委员会委员，兼任各组队长，其余委员分配到各组充任骨干。此种组织同时应为冬学小组，支前组长为当然学习组长，由支查会统一领导学习。内容：如讨论“支援前线是为谁干的”，“村里有没有小蒋介石”，“穷人翻身彻底不彻底”等，因而不拘形式的学校到处出现，需要民夫，由该会按劳力分配各组，家里留下的人，仍继续复查，特别是发动妇女、老人来复查。出外工作者，晚上回来也参加工作，白天不能开会就晚上开，家里驻有军队就到外面开。在全村老少讨论“村里有没有小蒋介石”时，就发现了隐藏的杀人犯、特务地主等各种罪恶活动，由此展开了群众性的反奸检举运动，并在冬学中教育改造了三个狗腿子都来同恶霸地主斗争，于是群众情绪大为高涨，有十一个青年参加了民兵，六十余农民参加了群众组织，向地主要回旧契约，丈量了土地。在支前空隙中，七天完成了复查。这一消息更鼓舞了本村在前线服务的民夫。复查后，各团体纷纷挑起来，坚决保田保家，老头子成立了“带路队”，老婆成立了“缝衣服”、“烙煎饼队”各种工作均非常活跃。
