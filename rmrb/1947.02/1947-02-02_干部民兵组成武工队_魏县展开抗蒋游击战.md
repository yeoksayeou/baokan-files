　　Cadres and Militiamen Form Armed Work Teams
    Wei County Launches Anti-Chiang Guerrilla Warfare
    [Our newspaper's Jinnan Weixian dispatch on the 27th] After the Chiang army invaded the south bank of the Zhanghe River in Wei County, individual despotic landlords took the opportunity to run rampant and establish puppet organizations. Wei County cadres and militiamen organized armed work teams and established county, district, and village command posts on the south bank of the Zhanghe River to cooperate with the guerrilla corps and persist in the struggle on the spot. When the cadres and militiamen of the Eighth District returned to their district, the masses were extremely happy, boiling water and cooking, and reporting enemy information. One night, our armed work team cut dozens of miles of enemy wires and laid minefields near strongholds and highways, and the enemy did not dare to move. At the same time, Li, the despotic landlord of Nantaitou Village, who carried out "retribution" and fined the family members of the militiamen ten dan of wheat, and two bad elements who colluded with the enemy were tied up. A meeting of village cadres from twenty-two villages and three mass meetings were convened, stating that they were determined not to leave here and to coexist with the masses. Resolutely suppress the despotic landlords and bad elements who collude with the enemy to carry out "retribution", and conduct current affairs education. The confidence of the masses in victory has been greatly increased, and they are determined to persist in the anti-Chiang struggle. They said, "Our dark days will not last long, and the light is long-term. During the anti-Japanese period, there was a bunker every three li and a stronghold every five li, and we were still able to persist in the struggle. Now we can persist even more!"
