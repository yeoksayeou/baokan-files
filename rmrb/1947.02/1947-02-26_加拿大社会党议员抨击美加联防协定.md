　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 23rd: According to TASS, Canadian Social Democratic Party MP, Yanyihad, commented in the House of Commons on the 17th that the US-Canada joint defense agreement during peacetime could easily become "the Munich Agreement of 1947." Yanyihad pointed out that it is impossible to say what position the United States will fall into tomorrow, but if mass unemployment occurs in the United States, it may fall into imperialist adventures. The US-Canada joint defense agreement, opposed by Yanyihad, was announced on the 12th of this month, stipulating that the two countries will conduct joint wartime defense measures within the framework of the United Nations, including mutual exchange of military personnel, standardization of equipment training, and mutual use of each other's defense equipment. Previously, according to Reuters: Canadian opposition leader and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation leader, Coldwell, said to the House of Commons on the 14th when discussing the US-Canada joint defense agreement: "For a long time, we have not gotten rid of the rule of Downing Street, but we do not want to see Downing Street replaced by Washington."

　　加拿大社会党议员抨击美加联防协定
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据塔斯社消息：加拿大社会党议员亚尼哈德，十七日于下院评论美加在和平时期的联防协定，很容易地变成“一九四七年的慕尼黑协定。”亚氏指出现在要说明美国明日会陷入怎样的地位是不可能的，但如果大批失业在美国发生时，它可能坠入帝国主义的冒险中。亚氏所反对之美加联防协定，系于本月十二日宣布者，其中规定两国在联合国范围内进行两国之战时联防措施，包括互相交换军事人员、装备训练之标准化，及互相使用对方防御设备等。前此据路透社讯：加拿大反对派领袖及自治领合作党领袖科德维尔，十四日于论及美加联防协定时告下院称：“很久以来我们即没摆脱唐宁街的统治，但我们不愿见到唐宁街为华府所代替。”
