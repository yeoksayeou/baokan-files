　　Postal Administration Takes Action to Produce
    [Our Newspaper] In response to Comrade Bo Yibo's call to "work hard and struggle to greet the light," all comrades of the Postal Administration have launched a production and thrift campaign. In the past week, the entire organization has formed four groups, starting production of milling flour, raising pigs, making tofu, rolling cigarettes, spinning cotton, and providing haircuts. Tests show that milling 100 catties of wheat can generate a profit of 1,600 yuan. Milling has been done for five days (three hours per day), earning 3,400 yuan. Haircuts for two days earned 900 yuan. Making tofu from 16 catties of soybeans can yield a net profit of 700 yuan. Everyone is very enthusiastic about production and has full confidence in completing the tasks. Regarding thrift: the organization has once again lowered its living standards and tightened its expenditures; calculations show that for lamp oil and coal alone, 238,000 yuan can be saved annually. For all other office supplies, it is stipulated that savings will be divided "20% to the public, 80% to the individuals." (Li Qiyan)

　　邮务总局动手生产
    【本报讯】邮务总局全体同志响应薄一波同志“艰苦奋斗迎接光明”号召，展开生产节约运动。一周以来，全机关组成四个小组，开始磨面、喂猪、做豆腐、卷烟、纺花、理发等生产。试验每磨麦子一百斤可获利一千六百元。已磨五天（每天三小时），赚洋三千四百元，理发两天，赚九百元。做豆腐每十六斤豆子，可得净利七百元。大家生产劲头很大，完成任务有充分信心。节约方面：机关又再次降低生活水平，紧缩开支；计算只灯油、煤炭两项，全年可省二十三万八千元。其他一切办公用物，规定节约所得“公二私八”分红。（李启艳）
