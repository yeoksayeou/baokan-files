Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: After the Japanese government agencies and public utilities unions' general strike plan was abandoned due to MacArthur's ban, the unions still broke up into smaller units and launched individual strikes. On the morning of the 1st, the unions did not hold a general strike, but the Transportation Workers' Union announced in the morning that the Railway Freight Car Workers' Union (with 130,000 members) under its jurisdiction would begin a separate strike at midnight on the 1st. According to a United Press reporter, it is expected that other unions will follow suit and hold separate strikes. Labor circles unanimously interpreted MacArthur's ban as being directed only at general strikes and not at individual strikes. On the night of the 31st, when Ii Shun, chairman of the Joint Struggle Committee, broadcast the cessation of the general strike plan, his tone was extremely sad and very brief. He concluded by saying: We shout: Long live the Japanese workers and peasants! We must recognize that this point has made a deep impression on the labor circles.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist leader Kyuichi Tokuda, commenting on MacArthur's order banning the general strike on the afternoon of the 31st, said: He was very sorry about this. He believes that MacArthur's order may destroy some of the achievements obtained by the Japanese labor organizations based on the Potsdam Declaration and the labor policy of the Far Eastern Commission. He also announced that he would issue a formal statement on the 1st.

　　日本总罢工横遭无理禁止后
    各工会发动个别罢工
    日共领袖德田抨击麦克阿瑟
    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：日本政府机关及公用事业等工会的总罢工计划，因麦克阿瑟的禁令而放弃后，各工会仍化整为零各自发动个别罢工。一日晨，各工会未举行罢工，但交通工人工会于晨间宣布，该工会所属铁路货车工人工会（拥有会员十三万人）将于一日午夜时分开始单独的罢工，据合众社记者称，预期其他工会亦将各别地跟着举行罢工。劳工界方面一致解释麦克阿瑟的禁令仅为对总罢工而非对个别罢工而发。三十一日夜，联合斗争委员会主席井伊俊广播停止总罢计划时，语气悲愤已极，且甚简短，他结语称：我们高呼：日本工农万岁！我们必须认识此点对劳工界印象极深。
    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：日共领袖德田球一于三十一日下午评论麦克阿瑟禁止总罢工的命令时称：他对此甚为遗憾，他认为麦克阿瑟的命令可能摧毁日本劳工组织基于波茨顿宣言及远东委员会的劳工政策所获得某些成果问题。并宣布他定于一日发表正式声明。
