    The People's Army Performs Meritorious Service for the People
    A Certain Unit on the Jiluyu Front
    Conducts Ideological Education During a March
    [Report from the Jiluyu Front, January 30th] The Second Company of a certain unit on the Jiluyu Front conducted ideological education during a march, ensuring high morale for battle, and the results were extremely significant. When marching through the recovered areas, the company's political instructor, wherever they went, investigated the suffering of the people during the occupation by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and compared it with their past free and happy lives for educational purposes. In a certain village in Juancheng, an old couple was enthusiastically boiling water for the soldiers, while wiping away tears. The political instructor asked the old couple why they were crying, and they cried as they said, "After the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived in Juancheng, they demanded two Mauser pistols from them, forcing them to sell all their possessions." Two liberated soldiers angrily said, "That gang of Chiang Kai-shek is evil; with Chiang Kai-shek, the people just can't live." Li Wenhe, a liberated soldier from the Second Platoon, also burst into tears as he recalled his own history. Originally, his family had a mother and a younger sister, with more than 30 mu of land, and they lived very well, but Chiang Kai-shek wanted to fight a civil war and forcibly conscripted him, leaving him with nothing. The political instructor asked him, and he cried and said angrily, "I'll talk about it when I get to my door, I can't say anymore now." Some newly liberated soldiers said, "In Chiang Kai-shek's army, we didn't do a single good thing, now that we've joined the Eighth Route Army, we must do good things."

    人民的军队为人民立功
　　冀鲁豫前线某部
    行军中开展思想教育
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十日电】冀鲁豫前线某部第二连在行军中开展思想教育，保证饱满的战斗情绪，收效极大。在收复区行军时，该连指导员每到一处，即调查蒋军侵占期间人民受灾苦况，和过去自由幸福的生活进行对比教育。在巨野某村，有一对老夫妇一面热心地为战士们烧水，一面擦着热泪，指导员问这对老夫妇为什么哭，他们哭着说：“蒋军到了巨野后，要他们出两枝盒子枪，逼得他们倾家荡产。”两个解放战士气的说：“蒋介石那一伙人就是坏，有一人蒋介石弄得人民就是不能活。”二排解放战士李文和想起自己的历史，也痛哭起来。原来他家一个母亲一个妹妹，有卅多亩地，生活过的很好，但是蒋介石要打内战，把他抓出来，弄个人财两光。指导员问他，他又哭又气地说：“我到我家门再说，现在我说不下去。”有的刚解放来的战士说：“在蒋介石队伍里，我们没有干一件好事，现在到了八路军一定要干出好事来。”
