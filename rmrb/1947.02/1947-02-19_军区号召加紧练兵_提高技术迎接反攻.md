　　Military Region Calls for Intensified Training
　　Improve Techniques to Prepare for Counter-Offensive
　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] To intensify training, improve techniques, and strive for victory in the Self-Defense War, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued instructions to all military sub-regions and field armies in late January, calling for the integration of war and training, the integration of technology and politics, and the resolute implementation of the mass line, launching a Wang Keqin movement in the training. The instructions reviewed the shortcomings of our army's past general lack of attention to training (except for certain field armies), and proposed that in the future, all gaps in the war must be used to conduct training to improve the combat effectiveness of the troops to meet the counter-offensive. In training, the instructions pointed out: it is necessary to combine war and training, combine politics and technology, so as to achieve consistency in learning and application, to fight on one side and train on the other, and after the training is over, training should be carried out immediately to prepare for the next battle. The experience and lessons of the battle should be fully incorporated into the training, with emphasis on repeated exercises, especially night exercises. Training should adhere to the principle of being "lean but precise," so that the combat effectiveness of the troops can be improved. All phenomena of using combat fatigue as an excuse for failing to seize the time for training must be overcome. Secondly, it is necessary to implement the mass line in training and launch the Wang Keqin movement. The People's Daily editorial on January 7 on "The Achievements of the Sixth Column in Implementing the Mass Line and the Spirit of the Gutian Conference" should be widely studied and implemented in the troops, and leaders must take the lead and combine leadership with the masses. Thirdly, in order to ensure that cadres are constantly replenished and improve their command ability, it is necessary: 1. In-service cadres should strengthen tactical learning, implement bottom-up mass-based combat summaries in the troops, constantly absorb new experiences, and study in detail the combat summaries of the field armies. 2. Military regions and military sub-regions should regularly hold short-term rotational training teams, cultivate battalion and company-level and special forces cadres at military and political universities, and should also transfer some local cadres to cultivate them as military cadres. 3. Cadres of guerrilla teams and armed work teams behind enemy lines should also be rotated back to study and summarize their experiences. 4. Military regions should, if possible, also hold short-term training classes for engineering, artillery, and machine gun personnel. As for political work in training, it is to ensure the completion of the above tasks. The tasks of political work are consistent with the tasks of military work, and its center is current affairs education and ideological education. It is necessary to use various specific facts to inspire commanders and fighters to hate the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, clarify the nature of the people's army, promote new heroism, and enhance courage and confidence in victory. The method of education can be to adopt the mass line as much as possible, such as speaking bitterness, reflecting on oneself, helping each other, and teaching each other. Some troops have adopted the method of mutual teaching among three types of people: old Eighth Route Army soldiers, new liberated area soldiers, and newly liberated soldiers, which has been very effective and should be promoted. Finally, the instructions called for: strengthening supplementary training and striving to complete new recruit education within a month.

　　军区号召加紧练兵
    提高技术迎接反攻
    【本报特讯】加紧练兵，提高技术，争取自卫战争胜利。晋冀鲁豫军区于一月下旬指示各军区及一切野战部队，号召战争与训练结合，技术与政治结合，并坚决贯彻群众路线，开展练兵中的王克勤运动。指示检讨了我军过去对训练普遍注意不够的缺点（某些野战军除外），提出今后必须利用一切战争空隙，进行练兵，以提高部队战斗力迎接反攻。在训练中，指示指出：必须使战争与训练结合、政治与技术结合，作到学用一致，作到一面战斗、一面训练，训练结束后，应即速进行训练，给下次战斗作好准备。战斗中的经验教训，应全部贯注于训练中，并着重反复演习，特别是夜间演习。训练应确掌少而精的原则，如此，部队战斗力必能提高。一切借口战斗疲劳，不抓紧进行训练的现象均须克服。其次，必须实行群众路线的练兵，开展王克勤运动。人民日报一月七日关于“第六纵队执行群众路线和古田会议精神的成就”的社论，应在部队中普遍学习和贯彻，并须实行首长亲自动手，领导与群众结合。第三、为保证干部不断获得补充和提高其指挥能力，必须：一、在职干部应加强战术学习，在部队中实行自下而上的群众性的战斗总结，随时吸取新的经验，并对野战军的各次战斗总结详细加以研究。二、军区、军分区应经常举办短期轮训队，在军政大学培养营、连级及特种兵种干部，并应抽调一部地方干部培养为军队干部。三、敌后游击队、武工队干部，也应轮番抽回学习总结其经验。四军区如有可能的话还应举办工兵、炮兵、机枪人员的短期训练班。至于训练中的政治工作，是保证上述任务的完成，政治工作任务与军事工作任务是一致的，其中心为时事教育与思想教育。必须用各种具体事实启发指战员对蒋介石反动集团的仇恨，明确人民军队的本质，发扬新英雄主义，提高勇气与胜利信心。其教育方法，可尽量采取诉苦反省互助互教等群众路线。若干部队采取八路军老战士、解放区新战士及新解放战士三种人互教办法，收效甚大，应予发扬。最后指示号召：加强各补充训练，争取在一个月内完成新兵教育。
