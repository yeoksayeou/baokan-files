    In the past month, the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops guarding the southern front of Taihang, the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, and along the Daqing Railway, as well as the northern front around Shijiazhuang and along the Zhengtai and Tongpu Railways, were confined to their strongholds due to the widespread guerrilla warfare we launched. Especially on the southern front, they dared not send out small units to harass. The largest offensive launched by the enemy and puppets against Taihang in January was on the 5th, when Yan Xishan's puppet troops, reinforced by a small number of Japanese soldiers, used five regiments to infiltrate the hinterland of Shouxian County.

    (1) Southern Front, Northern Henan Area: Under the call of the emulation campaign, the fighting capacity of our army has been generally improved. We have launched guerrilla warfare in the enemy-occupied areas, besieging the large strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, eliminating small strongholds, attacking traitorous armed forces "Returning Home Corps" and despots returning to villages, mobilizing the masses to oppose "counter-settlements," establishing guerrilla base areas behind enemy lines, and restoring democratic order. In the first ten days of the month, our army launched an offensive on the west side of the Pinghan Railway, successively capturing strongholds such as Zhanggongyuan, Heishan, Zhao Jiachang, and Shiyan west of Tangyin, Miaozhen in Qi County, Sanwenying north of Huojia, Fanglan and Gangzao northwest of Ji County. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops of Sun Dianying's department and the puppet security regiments of various counties were completely annihilated by us, either in whole regiments or companies. These battles shocked the enemy and puppets and boosted the morale of the people in the occupied areas. At the same time, the local armed forces and militia work teams of Anyang, Tangyin, Ji, Qi, and Hui Counties went deep behind enemy lines and recovered vast areas of lost territory. For example, Hui County recovered 42 villages and towns, and the Anyang Duan Fazhang work team alone recovered more than ten villages. The Anyang militia launched flying explosions, attacking the enemy and puppets with landmines, penetrating east of the Shuiye-Guantai Highway and the Zhanghuding and Tianzhu villages near Fengle Station. Shuiye and Jishan town south of it were frequently attacked by our militia. The enemy's rear guerrilla warfare in Tangyin has also penetrated to the east and west Jiusi villages east of Hebi and Lou Lou. The strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Hui County are extremely isolated. Our army and work teams are often active in the Wang Tomb of Xinxiang Lu and the Guancheng of Hui County. Around the Lunar New Year, we launched a political offensive, and the people in the enemy's rear launched an anti-"counter-settlement" movement. The traitorous despots who returned to the village for "counter-settlement" fled one after another. Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army was also panicked and shaken. On the 15th, four soldiers of the Jiaozuo Chiang Kai-shek army escaped and surrendered to us. On the 21st, our army launched an offensive on the Daqing line, crossed the railway, and captured the strongholds of Dahongqiao, Xiaogao, Xiaodong in Wuzhi, Xindian in Xiuwu, Erxianmiao in Qinyang, and Xijincheng in Boai in one fell swoop. On the 22nd night, we once captured Wen County, completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops defending the city. Now the vast rural areas south of the Daqing Road and on both sides of the Qin River have been recovered by us, and we are carrying out mass guerrilla warfare, launching anti-"counter-settlement," and rebuilding democratic order. In the overall situation of the enemy and our struggle on the southern front, we have completely grasped the initiative.

    (2) Northern Front, the outskirts of Shijiazhuang were relatively quiet in January. Wei Yonghe's puppet army and the "Returning Home Corps" of Yuanshi County occasionally robbed grain and raided. In the past, guerrilla warfare was not widely carried out, and the simple defense of fortifications and joint militia operations formed a passive situation. When the enemy and puppets surrounded the villages and towns, they adopted the tactics of attrition against the militia, dividing their forces to intercept our supporting militia, which made the joint defense ineffective. Now this situation has begun to change, and guerrilla warfare has gradually become active. At the same time, the construction of tunnels in the villages on the border of Gaoyi County has been scaled up, and the border joint defense has been expanded into a large joint defense, with enhanced strength. On the 17th, 80 puppet troops from Liao Village, Yuanshi County, who invaded Ji Village, were defeated by our Yanbao joint defense militia, killing and wounding 26 puppet troops, seizing one machine gun, five long and short guns, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. The puppet troops left four corpses and were defeated, creating a model case of militia warfare. After our army won a great victory in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway in the late ten days of the month, the 3rd Army of Chiang Kai-shek's army in Shijiazhuang, Huolu, and Jingxing has been partially transferred north, and we are launching sabotage operations on the eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway.

    (3) Shanxi, along the Zhengtai and Tongpu Railways: On the 3rd, Yan Xishan mobilized the entire 46th Division and parts of the 49th Division, 71st Division, and the 8th Column from Taiyuan, Yuci, Shouyang, and Yangquan, as well as a small number of Japanese troops, a total of five regiments, and on the 5th, they launched an offensive in four directions along the Zhengtai Railway into the hinterland of Shouyang, attempting to carry out large-scale military encroachment and annihilation of our Shouxian Independent Battalion. Our troops maneuvered and moved to outside the encirclement, cooperating with the militia to launch landmine warfare and attack their small units. By the 10th, the enemy's 46th Division had fled westward along the Zhengtai Railway, and other units of Yan's puppet troops had gradually withdrawn. By the 22nd, there were no enemy traces in the liberated areas of the county except for one village, Hedi. The characteristics of Yan's puppet offensive were the adoption of the Japanese invaders' tactics of excavation and mopping up, searching the mountains and clearing the countryside, and carrying out large-scale conscription and looting of property; politically, they carried out deception: such as not beating or scolding the masses when searching, not touching the property in the village at first, only looting the property of the empty houses in the wilderness, and sending the elderly back with travel expenses. However, young people were conscripted, and the masses were counter-settled, forcing the militia to betray and kill village cadres, activists, and military dependents.

    Yan's puppet's policy of creating no-man's land in January has been crushed by us. On the 4th, we annihilated more than 130 puppet soldiers of the 10th Column in Pingding, and on the 12th, we annihilated more than 30 puppet soldiers of Yan who committed crimes in Xiaobaicun, Taigu. Our local armed forces extensively launched guerrilla warfare, and the militia launched landmine warfare. Yan's puppet troops did not dare to move out in small units. At the same time, some of the masses who were forced by Yan's puppet troops to enter the city suffered from life difficulties and fled one after another. Yan's puppet's frenzied looting and conscription aroused dissatisfaction from all walks of life. We sent cadres and militia back to the village to gradually restore the no-man's land, mobilizing the masses to return to the village to organize guerrilla warfare and landmine warfare. After the 18th, our army attacked in Yuci and Qixian, recovering the 12 strongholds of Dongxijianzi in Yushe, Zhangming in Qixian, and others. The local situation has changed, and guerrilla warfare is advancing forward.

    南线展开立功运动
    高邑扩大边地联防
    太行边地一月对敌斗争
    一月来太行南线豫北平汉与道清沿线，北线石家庄外围、正太与同浦沿线守备之蒋伪，在我游击战争普遍开展下，特别是南线，困守据点，小股不敢出动窜扰，仅本月五日阎伪配属少数日军以五个团的兵力窜入我寿阳腹地，为一月份敌伪对太行最大的一次进攻。
    （一）南线豫北方面：在立功运动号召下，我军战斗力已普遍提高，开展了敌后被占区的游击战，包围蒋伪大据点，扫除小据点，打击奸特武装“还乡团”与回村恶霸，发动群众反“倒算”，建立了敌后游击根据地，恢复了民主秩序。上旬，平汉西侧我军发动进攻，连续攻克汤阴以西之张公园、黑山、赵家厂、石岩，淇县之庙镇，获嘉以北之三温营，汲县西北之方蓝、冈糟等据点，守备之蒋伪孙殿英部及各县伪保安团均系整营或一个中队被我全部歼灭。这些战斗震慑敌伪，振奋了被占区的人心。同时我安阳、汤阴、汲、淇、辉县各县地方武装与民兵武工队则深入敌后，收复了广大的失地。如辉县即收复了四十二村镇，安阳仅段法章武工队即收复了十余村庄。安阳民兵展开飞行爆炸，以地雷向敌伪进攻，已深入水（冶）观（台）公路以东，丰乐车站附近之张胡顶，天助村一带，该县水冶及其以南之积善镇均经常遭受我民兵的袭击。汤阴敌后游击战亦已深入至鹤壁、鹿楼以东之东西酒寺村一带，辉县蒋伪据点均极孤立，我军与武工队经常活跃于新乡潞王坟及辉县城关。旧历新年前后我展开政治攻势，敌后人民掀起反“倒算”运动，回村“倒算”之奸特恶霸纷纷逃窜。蒋伪军亦恐慌动摇，十五日焦作蒋军士兵四人即逃出向我投诚。二十一日道清线我军发动攻势，越过铁路，一举攻克武陟大虹桥、小高、小东、修武新店、沁阳二仙庙、博爱西金城等据点。并于二十二日夜一度攻克温县城，全部歼灭了守城蒋伪。现道清路南沁河两岸广大农村又为我收复，正开展群众游击战，发动反“倒算”，重建民主秩序。整个南线敌我斗争形势，我已完全掌握主动。
    （二）北线石家庄外围一月份较沉寂，元氏伪军魏永和部与还乡团不时抢粮与奔袭。过去游击战开展不大，由于单纯工事守卫与民兵联防作战形成被动。敌伪包围村镇时，对民兵采消耗战术，分兵截击我支援民兵，致联防作用失效。现此种形势已开始转变，游击战已逐渐活跃，同时高邑边地村庄，地道工事建设已具规模，边地联防亦已扩大成大联防，力量增强。十七日元氏廖村伪军八十余犯姬村即被我阎堡联防民兵击溃，毙伤伪二十六名，缴机枪一挺，长短枪五支及子弹数百发。该伪遗尸四具，溃不成军，造成民兵作战的模范战例。下旬平汉北段我军大捷后，石家庄、获鹿、井陉蒋军第三军已部分北调，我正对正太东段展开破击作战。
    （三）山西正太、同蒲沿线：三日，阎锡山自太原、榆次、寿阳、阳泉调集了四十六师全部及四十九师、七十一师、八纵队各一部，并有少数日军共五个团的兵力，于五日自正太沿线分四路突向我寿阳腹地进攻，企图对我作大规模军事蚕食与歼灭我寿阳独立营，我部队机动转移至合击圈外，配合民兵展开地雷战与打击其小股。至十日敌四六师即仓惶经正太路西调，其他各部阎伪亦逐渐撤回，至二十二日除河底一村外该县解放区内已无敌踪。此次阎伪进攻特点采用了日寇的抉剔扫荡，搜山清剿，大肆抓丁与抢掠资财；在政治上则进行欺骗：如搜出群众不打不骂，村中财物初到不动，仅抢掠野外空舍清野的财物，老年人支差发路费送回等。但青年则被抓走，并向群众倒算，强迫民兵叛变与残杀村中干部、积极分子与军属。
    一月份阎伪制造无人区的蚕食政策已被我粉碎。四日平定我歼伪十纵队一百三十余人，及十二日太谷我歼大小白村出犯阎伪三十余人，我地方武装广泛展开游击战，民兵展开地雷战，阎伪小股已不敢出动。同时被阎伪强迫入城的部分群众，生活困难纷纷逃出，阎伪的疯狂掠夺与抓丁引起了各阶层的不满。我则派干部与民兵回村逐渐恢复无人区，发动群众回村组织游击战与地雷战。十八日后榆次、祁县我军均出击，收复榆社东西见子，祁县张名等十二据点。当地形势一变，游击战争正向前推进。
