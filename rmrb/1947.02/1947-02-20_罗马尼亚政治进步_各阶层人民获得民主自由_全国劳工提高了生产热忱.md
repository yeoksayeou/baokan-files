Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 18th: London dispatch: News reporter Younger recently stated in a radio commentary: Under the capable leadership of Dr. Groza, Romania will become a nation of the people's world. Younger discussed the results of his visit to Romania, proving that the Groza government enjoys the overwhelming trust of the majority of the people. He said, "When I say 'people,' I mean not only industrial workers and farmers, but also many churches and other groups." He said that shortly after the opening of the new Romanian parliament, delegations of soldiers and a church delegation personally led by Baterich visited Groza. These delegations expressed satisfaction with the results of last November's election and guaranteed the loyal support of the people they represented for the government. Ethnic minorities are also represented in the parliament. Although most of Romania's farmers are illiterate, they are well aware of the overall situation, opposing Maniu's opposition Peasant Party and supporting Groza's Peasant Front, which cooperates with the Democratic Alliance (including the Communist Party and the Socialist Party). Romania's recovery work is currently underway under difficult conditions according to plan. The degree of success Romania has achieved in saving itself from complete economic ruin is due to the selfless attitude and assistance of the Soviet Union and the new labor spirit that has grown out of Romania's democratic system. Romanian workers have many reasons to complain, but they have never complained or gone on strike. Because they believe that the future belongs to them, and the quality of this future depends on how they act. The new status of women is also an important factor in Romania today. There are sixteen female members of parliament and female cabinet members. Female workers receive equal pay for equal work. The author concludes by saying: "Of course, the Romanian people have not yet completed the journey of overcoming the remnants of the old regime, and to some extent, the new regime has not yet bridged the gap between cities and villages. But the people already feel that the old way of life is giving way to freedom."

　　罗马尼亚政治进步
    各阶层人民获得民主自由
    全国劳工提高了生产热忱
    【新华社延安十八日电】伦敦讯：新闻记者杨格，顷在无线电评论中称：在格罗查博士干练的领导之下，罗马尼亚将成为一个人民世界的国家。杨格谈他访问罗国的结果，证明格罗查政府享有压倒多数人民的信任。他说：“当我说‘人民’时，我的意思不仅是产业工人、农民，还有许多教会与其他团体”。他说罗国新国会开幕后，不久拜访格罗查的，有军人代表团与巴特利契亲自率领的教会代表团。这些代表团，均表示满意于去年十一月的大选结果，并保证他们所代表的阶层人民，对政府的忠诚拥护。少数民族在国会中，亦有代表。罗国农民虽大部是文盲，但均深明大局，反对马尼乌的反对派农民党，而拥护与民主联盟（包括共产党与社会党）合作的格罗查的农民阵线。罗国的恢复工作，刻正依据计划在困难条件下进行。罗国在使自己免于完全的经济毁灭上的大小成功，均应归功于克己为人的苏联之态度与援助，以及罗国人民从民主制度中生长出来的新的劳动精神。罗国劳动者虽有许多理由可以抱怨，但他们从未抱怨，也未罢工。因为他们认为将来是属于他们的，这个将来的好坏，要看他们自己怎样作。妇女的新地位亦是今日罗国的一个重要因素，国会有妇女议员十六人，并在内阁中有阁员。女工获得了同工同酬的待遇。作者结语说：“当然，罗国人民还未走完克服旧政权残余的路程，在某种程度上说，新政权尚未填平城市与乡村间的鸿沟。但是人民已觉得旧的生活方式，是让位于自由了”。
