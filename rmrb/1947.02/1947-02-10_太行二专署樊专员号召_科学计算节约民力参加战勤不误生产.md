Taihang Second Administrative Office, Prefectural Commissioner Fan Calls For
    Scientific Calculation to Save Civilian Labor, Participate in War Service Without Delaying Production
    [This newspaper reports] At the joint county magistrate meeting held by the Taihang Second Administrative Office in January, Prefectural Commissioner Fan called on all counties to vigorously resolve the contradiction between war service supply, the people's burden, and production. Regarding the burden of civilian labor, he pointed out that there are now problems such as heavy corvée, a small burden-bearing population, and an imbalance in corvée. In a wartime environment, first of all, we must establish a mass perspective of cherishing, saving, and promoting civilian labor; secondly, we must scientifically calculate, organize, and promote civilian labor. In addition to regular preparations for rapid concentration and rapid demobilization, we must also seize the gaps in the war to organize participating masses to produce. Voluntary transportation should strive to have a return trip and be able to make money. The leadership should carefully plan the location and route of voluntary transportation to avoid carrying the wrong cargo and delaying work. Supporting the front should promote the experiences of Xiyang and Heshun, turning supply stations into transportation stations, so as not to delay corvée or production. Promote the method of Dazhong Village in Yushe, which unifies the scoring of all the village's labor force, setting fixed scores flexibly, overcoming the difficulty of labor shortage, and doing a good job in participation in the war, voluntary transportation, and production. Last year, during the voluntary transportation in Licheng in August, this method saved several thousand laborers, and all localities should learn from it. In addition, it is necessary to organize auxiliary labor and reward elderly men, women, and children for light and short corvée to reduce the number of people who do not bear corvée. Militia participation in the war, training, and cadre meetings should be converted into work points. Regarding the issue of imbalanced corvée, a inspection and reporting system should be established, with the administrative office coordinating various counties, the county coordinating districts, and the district coordinating villages. Regarding the issue of village financial and social burdens, a top-down approval system should be established to overcome random donations and arbitrary spending. Donations for supporting the army and joining the army must be approved by the county and district. Village expenditures should be based on production self-sufficiency and not taken from the people.

    太行二专署樊专员号召
    科学计算节约民力参加战勤不误生产
    【本报讯】太行二专署元月份召开的县长联席会上，樊专员号召各县大力解决战勤供应人民负担与生产的矛盾。关于民力负担，他指出现在有差务重、差力负担面小、差务不平衡等问题。在战争环境下。首先要树立爱惜、节省与发扬民力的群众观点；其次要科学计算，组织与发扬民力。参战工作，除经常准备使能迅速集中与迅速复员外，还要抓紧战争空隙，组织参战群众生产。义运要争取有回脚，能赚钱。领导上要精密计划义运地点与路线，避免背误工。支差要发扬昔阳、和顺经验，把兵站变成运输站，既误不了差，也误不了生产。发扬榆社大众村将全村劳力统一评分、死分活定，克服劳力缺乏的困难，把参战、义运、生产都搞好。黎城去年八月义运中以此办法省了好几千劳力，各地应学习。另外要组织辅助劳力，奖励老汉与妇女儿童出轻差与短差，减少不支差人数。民兵参战、集训、干部开会，折顶勤工。差务不平衡问题，要建立检查报告制、由专署调剂各县，县调剂区，区调剂村、关于村财政社会负担问题，要建立自上而下的批准制度，克服乱捐与随便花销。劳军、参军时的募捐，均要经县区批准。村的开支，应以生产自给，不自民取。（玉）
