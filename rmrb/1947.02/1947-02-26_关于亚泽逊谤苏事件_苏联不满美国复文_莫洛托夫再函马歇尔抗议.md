Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 23rd: TASS reports that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent a note to U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith on February 14th regarding the anti-Soviet statement made by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Iazykov. Molotov received a reply from U.S. Secretary of State Marshall on February 18th, stating: Iazykov's statement cannot be considered unforgiving, as it was within his responsibilities, and the statement should be attributed to his frankness rather than hostility. On February 20th, Molotov replied to Marshall, stating that Marshall's reply regarding Iazykov's hostile remarks was unconvincing, and the Soviet government still adheres to the views expressed in Molotov's note of February 14th.

　　关于亚泽逊谤苏事件
    苏联不满美国复文
    莫洛托夫再函马歇尔抗议
    【新华社延安二十三日电】塔斯社报导，苏外长莫洛托夫二月十四日曾就美副国务卿亚泽逊发表仇苏声明一事，致送美国驻苏大使史密斯照会一件。莫洛托夫于二月十八日接到美国务卿马歇尔之复电，内称：亚氏声明不能称为不是原恕，盖此乃其职责所在，该声明应归于他的坦白而非敌意。二月二十日，莫洛托夫函复马歇尔称，马氏关于亚泽逊敌意谈话之复函不足令人信服，苏联政府仍坚持二月十四日莫洛托夫照会中所阐明之见解。
