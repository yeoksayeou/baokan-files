    Through individual visits with relatives and friends
    Dongzhang Mobilizes Backward Peasants
    [This newspaper Taihang, 2nd dispatch] Dongzhang Village, in the fifth district of Changzhi, is a small village. District cadres don't stay long, and village cadres are bought off by landlords. The masses have revolted several times, but were suppressed by the landlords. In order to eliminate this backward village, the district transferred on the 11th of last month nine activists from Nan Song Village, including Qin Luyou, five women including Wang Baobei, and two district cadres to form a work team to help the masses of Dongzhang Village to achieve liberation. At first, they could not find any problems, so they began to conduct individual visits through kinship. Song Shangui went to mobilize Wang Xiaohai, asking him why he didn't want to be liberated. He said he didn't dare. When asked if it was good that the Eighth Route Army had come, he said it was good, but it wasn't good for him. He cried and said: "My father starved to death during the famine, and I herded sheep at the age of nine and became a farmhand at the age of nineteen. I demanded to struggle against the landlord and settle accounts for my labor, but the village head listened to the landlord and beat me up. Who dares to speak?" After this problem was discovered, they seized the opportunity to publicize and deliberate, and quickly mobilized 56 people and educated the cadres. They are now thoroughly settling accounts with the landlords.

    通过亲友个别访问
    东掌发动落后农民
    【本报太行二日电】长治五区东掌村，因为村小，区干部不久住，村干部被地主收买，群众几次闹翻身，都被地主打下去了。区上为了消灭落后村，上月十一日从南宋村抽调出积极分子秦禄有等九人、妇女王宝贝等五人、区干部两人，组成翻身队，帮助东掌村群众翻身。开始发现不了问题，后来便通过亲戚关系，个别访问。宋拴贵去动员王小孩，问他为啥不翻身，他说不敢，问他八路军来了好不好，他说好是好，就是对我不好，说着就哭了说：“俺爹是灾荒年饿死，自己九岁放羊，十九岁当长工。我要求斗地主算工账，村长听上地主的话，把我打了一顿，谁敢说话呀。”这问题发现后，就抓紧宣传酝酿，很快便发动了五十六个群众，并教育了干部，现正向地主进行彻底清算。
