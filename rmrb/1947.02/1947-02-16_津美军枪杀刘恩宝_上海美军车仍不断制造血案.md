At around 10 a.m. on the 3rd, while moving cargo boxes for the US military, he accidentally damaged one of the boxes. A US soldier supervising the work came forward to beat him, and Liu Enbao tried to escape.

In order to determine responsibility, the hospital asked the accompanying US soldier to sign and take responsibility. At around 12 p.m., he died in the hospital due to his severe injuries. This atrocity has aroused great indignation among the citizens. Liu's elder sister has requested the Tianjin Municipal Government to lodge a serious protest with the US military authorities, negotiate for the punishment of the murderer, and demand compensation.
