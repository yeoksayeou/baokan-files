　　Dongyuan People Take the Initiative to Attack and Open Up the Enemy's Rear
    Sixty-Year-Old Man Leads His Son to Join the Army and Wage Guerrilla War Against Chiang
    [Our newspaper's telegram from Jilu豫 on the 1st] In Dongyuan, Chiang's troops rape, kill, burn, and loot everywhere, seizing grain and conscripting soldiers, leaving the vast masses with nothing to eat or wear, and unable to survive. This has aroused strong anger among the people of the entire county. The masses in certain two districts have risen up to join the Eighth Route Army and guerrilla forces. Yu Kezhi, an old tenant farmer from Luozhai Village in the Sixth District, is over sixty years old and led his three sons to join the army. The eldest son is a cook in a certain unit, the second son is in the district team, and the third son is a squad leader in a certain unit's company. The old hero Yu Kezhi is in a certain unit's militia company and is as brave as a young man in every battle, telling others, "If we don't defeat the reactionaries, we won't have a home!" In a certain village, a family of three brothers all joined the army together. All three brothers were tenant farmers who lived a happy life of plenty under the leadership of the democratic government. Now, they have been made unable to live by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Therefore, the three brothers were determined not to go home until the reactionaries were defeated.
    How was the guerrilla warfare situation opened up in Dongyuan?
    When Chiang and puppet troops had not yet invaded Dongyuan County, the military and civilians in the county were not fully prepared ideologically or organizationally. When Chiang and the puppets occupied the county, they once hastily gathered county, district, and village cadres, militia, and their families, and all withdrew from the county. Chiang and the puppets, in cooperation with local secret agents, quickly established a government and secret agent armed forces. The leadership studied the situation and believed that they must fight back and persist in the struggle, organizing several armed guerrilla teams and work teams from the county cadres to advance towards their hometowns. After returning to Dongyuan, the first battle was fought, defeating more than fifty puppet secret agent troops and capturing more than ten alive. They cracked down on die-hard evil secret agent elements. As for those who had gone astray among the enemy's forces nearby, they were allowed to reflect, and they were asked to admit their mistakes in front of the masses to win them back. They proposed, "Regardless of whether it is voluntary or forced, as long as they are determined to turn back, they will not be held accountable." On November 16th of last year, they shattered the enemy's last large-scale encirclement and suppression, with the enemy paying the price of more than twenty people. Thus, after countless battles by our military and civilians, the situation was finally opened up. The puppet regimes and secret agent armed forces of most townships, towns, and bao retreated in panic. In our central area, we have a foothold, opened up a vast base area, order has been restored, and the people can live on their own land again.

　　东垣人民主动进攻游击敌后打开局面
    六十老汉带子参军游击抗蒋
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】东垣蒋军到处奸淫烧杀，抢粮抓丁，闹的广大群众无吃无穿，不能活命，引起全县群众的强烈愤怒。某两区群众已纷纷起来参加八路军与游击队，六区罗寨村老佃户于可智已六十多岁了，领着三个儿子参了军。长子在某部任炊事员，次子在区队，三子在某部一连任班长。于可智老英雄在某部民兵连，每次作战和青年一样的英勇，并告诉别人说：“打不退反动派就没有家”！某村有一家亲弟兄三人一齐参了军。弟兄三人都是佃户出身，在民主政府的领导下过着丰衣足食的快活日子，现在又被国民党反动派弄得无法生活。于是弟兄三人下定了决心，不打退反动派不回家。
    东垣游击战局面是怎样打开的？
    当蒋伪军未进犯到东垣县时，该县军民在思想上、组织上都未充分准备。蒋伪侵占该县时，曾一度手忙脚乱的集合了县、区、村干部、民兵及家属，全部退出了县境。蒋伪配合当地特务，很快建立了政权及特务武装。领导上研究了情况，认为必须打回去坚持斗争，将全县干部组织了数支武装游击队和武工队向老家进发。进回东垣后，第一仗就打响了，击溃伪特务武装五十余人，活捉十余人。他打击了死心塌地作恶的特务分子，对附近敌的失足分子，则让他们反省，叫他们在群众面前承认错误，争取他们回头。提出“不管自愿或被迫的，只要决心回头，概不追究。”去年十一月十六日，粉碎了敌人最后一次大规模的围剿，敌人还付出了二十多人的代价。这样经过我军民无数次战斗，终于打开了局面。使大部分乡、镇、保伪政权及特务武装狼狈退出。我中心区，我们有了立脚点，开辟了广大的根据地、秩序也恢复了，人民又能生活在自己的土地上。
