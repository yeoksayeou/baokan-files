　　[Peking University News from this Newspaper] Peking University is launching a production and thrift campaign. In terms of production: flour mills, tofu workshops, cooperatives, grinding mills, transportation... etc., have been established. The Finance Institute alone has earned 203,860 yuan in ocean currency from transportation and cooperatives, which is enough to cover the public miscellaneous expenses of the institute. Currently, various institutes have launched a wave of agricultural production, deciding that each person should cultivate one mu of land, and more than 2,500 baskets of fertilizer have been accumulated. In terms of thrift: President Fan took the lead in quitting smoking cigarettes, and Director Zhang of the Academic Affairs Office, Secretary-General Luo, and others responded, which can save a total of 240,000 yuan in cigarette money for the whole year. It was also decided that the school's public miscellaneous expenses for the whole year would be resolved by production in each institute. The total annual allowance for all faculty and staff, amounting to 652,000 yuan, will be entirely saved. The allocation of wheat has been drafted as follows: (1) the allocation for staff members will be reduced from two-thirds to one-quarter, saving a total of 46,300 jin; (2) the allocation for students and general affairs personnel will be reduced from one-third to one-quarter, saving 46,220 jin. The entire school can save a total of 892,000 yuan in ocean currency and 92,520 jin of wheat. (Wang Liangyi, Liu Jianmin, Wang Lishan)

　　[Taihang News from this Newspaper] Taihang Third Middle School responded to the call for production and thrift. On February 9th, a meeting was held to determine that each person should complete 200 jin of vegetables for public production and 1,500 yuan for personal production throughout the year. Public production will focus on agriculture and be supplemented by transportation. It is estimated that 100 mu of land will be cultivated, with each mu yielding 500 jin of vegetables (potatoes), for a total yield of 50,000 jin. After deducting one-tenth for rewards, a net of 45,000 jin of vegetables can be harvested, which can supply the entire school of 300 teachers and students for five months. In addition, an agricultural experimental field will be opened to plant various special crops, so that through agricultural production, the use of soil, fertilizer, and seeds can be learned. In terms of transportation: they carry their own coal for burning, which can generate a net income of more than 360,000 yuan per month. Personal production: includes handicrafts and sideline occupations, and the school will provide assistance. It is stipulated that for those earning up to 1,500 yuan, profits will be divided according to a 20/80 public/private split; for those exceeding 1,500 yuan, profits will be divided according to a 10/90 public/private split. Currently, activities underway include spinning cotton, weaving cloth, weaving towels, making soap, toothpaste, pickles, raising pigs, and raising chickens. There are also plans to dig medicinal herbs and cut wood in the mountains to solve some of the difficulties with supplies. (Xiao Yanguang)
