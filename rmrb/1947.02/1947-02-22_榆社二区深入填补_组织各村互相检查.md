[Taixing Telegraph, This Paper, 19th] The filling-gaps movement in the second district of Yushe has entered a deeper stage. In order to completely eliminate feudalism, villages are organized to carry out mutual inspections. The organizational method is as follows: inspection members are selected by the masses to work with village cadres to form inspection teams; the inspection method involves holding meetings for discussion and conducting individual visits through relatives. After several days of work, it has been discovered that Sanzhuang Village did not adequately care for small poor villages in the distribution of fruits. In Yinjiao, Zhongnihe and other villages, there are still backward people who pity landlords. In Xiakou Village, military dependents were not adequately cared for in the distribution of land. In Xuebu Village, it was discovered that landlords Wang Shoukui and others were still hiding ten trees, a large pot, farm tools, and other items. This inspection broke the cadres' complacency, and everyone unanimously recognized that the roots of feudalism had not yet been completely eradicated. Now, all villages are actively conducting in-depth inspections and mobilizing the backward, determined to complete land reform before spring.

[Taixing Telegraph, This Paper, 20th] The emancipation movement in the third district of Shouyang, lasting forty days from December 10th of last year to the present, has seen peasants take back more than 2,000 mu of land and other property from the hands of local bullies and landlords. The movement is being carried out in conjunction with the war, holding guns on one hand and struggling on the other. For example, in Nanxu, Senlin, and Fengpo, under the "flood-style" swallowing offensive of the Yan puppet regime, liaison sentry posts were set up to monitor the enemy, and meetings were held in the village to pour out grievances and struggle. At the beginning, the district leadership paid attention to ideological mobilization, first conducting training for more than fifty poor peasants and hired laborers, clarifying the two issues of "the poor's poverty is rooted in the landlords, and the landlords' wealth is rooted in the poor" through enlightenment and grievance-pouring. Secondly, during the movement, attention was paid to uniting the middle peasants. In the distribution of fruits, the principle was to distribute what was lacking first, filling the holes before making up for the rest. Most villages used village-wide unified distribution and took care of poor villages. Now, the movement in this district has entered a deeper stage.

　　榆社二区深入填补
    组织各村互相检查
    【本报太行十九日电】榆社二区填补运动，已进入深入阶段，为彻底消灭封建，组织各村展开互相检查。其组织办法为：由群众选出检查员，配合村干部共同组织检查组；检查的方式是运用开会研究及通过亲戚关系进行个别访问。进行数日，已发现三庄村在分果实中，对小穷村照顾不够。银郊、中泥河等村，还有落后人可怜地主。峡口村分田对军属照顾不够。薛补村查出地主王守奎等，还藏有十株树，一口大锅，农具等物。经过检查，打破了干部的自满情绪，大家一致认识了封建根底还未刨尽。现各村正积极进行深入检查，发动落后，决予春前完成土地改革。
    【本报太行二十日电】寿阳三区翻身运动，自去年十二月十日至今历时四十日，农民由恶霸地主手中，夺回土地二千余亩及其他财物。运动是结合战争进行的，一面持枪，一面斗争，如南窳森林凤坡，即在阎伪“水漫”式的吞食进攻下，伙放联络哨，监视敌人，村中开会诉苦斗争。开始时区的领导上即注意了思想发动，首先进行了五十余人的贫雇训练，从启发诉苦中，明确了“穷人的穷根在地主，地主的富根在穷人”两个问题。其次在运动中，注意了团结中农，在分配果实上，是按缺甚分甚，先填圪洞后补齐的做法，大部村庄是以编村统一分配，并照顾了穷村。现该区运动已进入深入阶段。
