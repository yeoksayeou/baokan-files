Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. A comprehensive report from various sources: Following the unprecedented economic crisis in the KMT-controlled areas triggered by the gold case, Chinese and foreign public opinion fiercely criticized the speculation and manipulation by the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. U.S. imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk, recognizing that the crisis had affected the entire rule of the Chiang regime, hurriedly came forward to defend them. At a press conference in Washington on the 15th, Marshall defended the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen, saying, "The majority of the Chinese people are farmers, and the extent to which they are directly affected by the currency value is not as great as that of the American people." On the 17th, Chiang Kai-shek made a true portrayal of himself and his comrades: "Those who engage in speculation and trickery think they can manipulate the market to their advantage, without shame, and morality is completely swept away. The recent gold case in Shanghai is clear proof of this." His subordinates, such as Soong and Kung, attacked each other, shirking responsibility. At the Legislative Yuan meeting, it was openly attacked that the Executive Yuan was seriously corrupt and inefficient, and that Soong and Kung should bear full responsibility for the gold case. Soong Tzu-wen and Kung Hsiang-hsi hurriedly "firmly denied that he had purchased gold or was related to the main gold purchasers" (see Central News Agency English draft). On the 14th of this month, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen "urged immediate inspection," and Kung's associate Yu Hongjun declared at the参政会 ("Council of State Affairs"): "I have also heard about the use of military pay to buy gold in Shanghai," deliberately implying that this was done by the Ministry of National Defense, while the Ministry of National Defense was vague, seemingly denying it, but not really denying it.

At the same time, the Jiang authorities immediately adopted so-called "emergency measures," shifting the blame to small and medium-sized producers. On the 14th, Chiang Kai-shek sent his trusted secret service chief Zheng Jiemin to Shanghai to cooperate with the municipal government and the police bureau to inspect business people, who were used as scapegoats. The Shanghai Municipal Government forced rice shops to sell rice at 78,000 yuan per shi on February 5th, while the price of rice had already risen to 200,000 yuan, and many rice shops were forced to close. Xuan Tiewu immediately ordered a search of rice shops, taking the opportunity to make a fortune. The second scapegoat is private banks. According to the Associated Press, "Tongfeng," one of the oldest gold shops in Shanghai, has suffered. In Guangzhou, under the emergency measure of "banning unapproved banks," 83 large firms were forced to stop business.

However, the rising prices could not be stopped by this. On the 16th, the Supreme National Defense Council issued the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," and Chiang Kai-shek also made a speech. In his speech, he first stated that the economic crisis was due to "eight years of destruction by Japanese pirates"; in the future, "we will certainly achieve democratic politics and restore the normal state of our country's economy," and hoped that friendly countries would "sympathize and understand," that is, asking the United States to continue to provide large amounts of aid, especially to allocate the US$500 million loan as soon as possible. Secondly, he blamed the CCP, saying that the economic crisis "is caused by the Communist Party's disturbance of the country and destruction of peace in the past year," as an excuse to expand the civil war. In fact, the liberated areas led by the CCP are the safest economic and happiest paradise for the people in the country, which cannot be compared with the KMT-controlled areas.

The so-called "Economic Emergency Measures Case" includes the following important items: (1) Increase the tax revenue directly plundering the people, that is, "strictly implement various tax revenues to enrich the treasury, pay special attention to the collection of direct taxes, and add new tax rates." (2) Gold is nationalized, foreign exchange is prohibited from being bought and sold, and financial and import and export trade controls are strengthened. Any bank or firm may not engage in foreign remittances and goods sales business without government entrustment. All gold note holders must exchange legal currency with the Central Bank, and those who violate it will be confiscated and sentenced to imprisonment. That is, it is forbidden for legitimate business people going abroad to have any freedom to trade or obtain foreign exchange, and all gold notes are concentrated in the hands of the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen, and only they can engage in speculative manipulation. It was also decided that the Central Bank would allocate US$200 million in foreign exchange to facilitate their use. (3) Dominate materials, control prices, and the transportation and sales of rice, flour, cloth, fuel, salt, white sugar, cooking oil, and other daily necessities and prices are completely monopolized by the government (that is, the four families), and legitimate merchants have no foothold. (4) Attack workers and reduce workers' living standards. "The living figures in January of this year shall be used as the highest index, and the basic salary shall not be increased in any way," and "factory closures, strikes, or go-slows are prohibited" to stifle the labor movement. The four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen made economic crises by speculating and manipulating, and made a fortune from the "crisis," causing the lives of people of all classes to quickly go bankrupt. At the same time, under the pretext of the economic crisis, emergency measures were issued to deprive the people of any right to earn a living, so that all industrial, commercial, and financial undertakings were completely concentrated in their own hands, and speculative manipulation was legally guaranteed. This is the most vicious way to suck the blood and sweat of the people of the country to fatten the four families. Yesterday, United Press reported that this method would only add fuel to the fire of the economic crisis.

### 蒋政府颁发“经济紧急措施”  四大家大发“危机财”

　　蒋政府颁发“经济紧急措施”
    四大家大发“危机财”
    【新华社延安十九日电】综合各方报导：蒋管区由黄金案而引起之空前巨大经济危机发生后，中外舆论对蒋宋孔陈四大家族之投机操纵猛烈抨击。美帝国主义与蒋介石等辈鉴于危机已影响蒋政权整个统治，急忙出面辩师。马歇尔十五日在华府记者招待会上替蒋宋孔陈四大家族辩护称：“中国大部分民众均为农民，其直接受币值影响之程度，不若美国人民之甚。”蒋介石十七日替自己及其同道作了写真：“投机取巧者，自以为能操纵市场为得计，恬不知耻，礼义廉耻扫地无余。上海最近发生之黄金案即其明证。”其下宋孔等一辈则相互攻讦，推卸罪责。立法院会议上公开攻击行政院贪污严重、效率低微，宋孔对黄金案应负全责任。宋子文、孔祥熙连忙“坚决否认他曾购买黄金或与主要的黄金购买者有关”（见中央社英文稿）。在本月十四日，沪市长吴国桢“催促立即检查”，孔系俞鸿钧在参政会上宣称：“对利用军饷在沪购买黄金事，亦有所闻”，故意暗示此事系国防部所为，而国防部则含糊其词，似乎否认，又不否认。
    与此同时，蒋当局即采取所谓“紧急措施”，嫁祸中小产者。蒋介石十四日派亲信特务头子郑介民到上海会同市府与警察局检查，被作为替死鬼开刀的商民。沪市府迫答米店于二月五日米价以七万八千元一石售出，而其时米价已涨至二十万元大关，不少米店被迫停业。宣铁吾即下令搜查米店，乘机大发横财。第二号替死鬼是民营银行，据美联社透露，已有一家沪市最老金店“同丰”遭殃。广州在“取缔未经核准的银行业”的紧急措施下，八十三家大行号被迫停止营业。
    但物价涨风并不能由此平止，十六日国防最高委员会乃颁发“经济紧急措施方案”，蒋介石并发表谈话，其谈话首称此次经济危机系由于“八年日寇之破坏”；今后“必能达到民主政治及恢复我国经济之正常状态”，尤望各友邦“予以同情及谅解”，即要美国继续大量援助，尤其是早些拨出五亿美金贷款。其次则嫁祸中共，说此次经济危机“系一年来共党扰乱国家、破坏和平之所致”，以作为扩大内战之借口。而实际上，中共所领导之解放区为全国经济最安全、民生最幸福之乐园，与蒋管区不可同日而语。
    所谓“经济紧急措施案”，其重要项目有：（１）加重直接掠夺人民的税收，即“严格执行各种税收以裕库存，特别注意征收直接税，并附加新税率”。（２）黄金国有，禁止买卖外汇，加强金融与进出口贸易管制，任何银号行庄非经政府委托不得兼营国外汇款及物品购销业务，凡金钞持有人必须向中央银行兑换法币，违者没收，并处徒刑。即禁止正当出外工商业者有任何贸易或取得外汇自由，将所有金钞集中到蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族手中，唯有他们可作投机操纵勾当。并决定由中央银行拨出二万万美金，外汇便利他们使用。（３）统治物资，管制物价，食米、面粉、纱布、燃料、食盐、白糖、食油及其他日用必需品之运销和价格，完全由政府（即四大家）垄断，正当商人无立足余地。（４）进攻劳工，降低工人生活。“以本年一月份之生活数为最高指数，亦不得以任何方式增加底薪”，并“禁止闭厂罢工或怠工”，以窒息工运。蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族以投机操纵制造经济危机，大发“危机财”，使各阶层人民生活迅速破产。同时，又以经济危机为理由，颁发紧急措施方案，剥夺人民任何谋生权利，使一切工商金融事业完全集中到自己手里，投机操纵得到合法保障，这是吸干全国人民血汗以养肥四大家族的最恶毒办法。昨日合众社电讯称：此一办法对于经济危机只会火上加油。
