Combining Investigation, Rent Reduction, and Military Training
Hukuan Achieves Results

In preparation for supporting the armed counter-offensive in the border areas and recovering lost territories, the Hukuan militia has launched military training during the rent reduction campaign, with 105 main villages achieving remarkable results. In the Lingdong and Hedi sub-districts of the Third District, 20 main village militias have learned bayonet fighting and mine laying; grenade throwing generally reaches 34 meters. In the Second District, military training has been widely carried out in 27 out of 30 main villages. In the Sixth District, all 24 village militias are utilizing the rent reduction campaign, or winter production breaks, to engage in military training, combined with current affairs education.

    查减练武结合
    壶关获得成绩
    为准备支援边地武装反攻，收复失地。壶关民兵于查减运动中展开练武，已有一百零五个主村获得显著成绩。三区岭东、河底两个小区，有二十个主村民兵学会刺枪、埋雷；投弹一般已达到三十四米。二区三十个主村中有二十七个普遍开展练武。六区二十四村民兵们都利用查减，或冬季生产间隙练武，并结合时事教育。
