    Yan'an Agencies
    Will Transfer Large Numbers of Cadres
    To Participate in Land Purchase
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government promulgated a draft land purchase regulation last year and sent work groups to implement it on a trial basis. Statistics from only five townships show that farmers agreed to purchase 26,000 mu of land. During the purchase, landlords were left with at least 50% more land per person than middle peasants, and the basic interests of rich peasants were not infringed upon. Most middle peasants had been deceived and exploited by landlords, and they actively participated in the struggle against local bullies and landlords at mass meetings. Many tenant farmers and middle peasants also purchased land. The farmers who obtained land immediately displayed a surge in production enthusiasm. Farmers in Haojiaqiao, Suide, are working day and night to repair farm tools in preparation for spring plowing. People are singing joyfully, waving their arms and stamping their feet: "Rent reduction and interest reduction, a half-turnover," "Land purchase, a complete turnover," "Land is the home, the farmer is the master." After the land purchase in Wangjia Yuan Township, Qingyang County, 90% of the farmers organized themselves. In order to strive for the thorough completion of land reform, Yan'an agencies will transfer a large number of cadres to Suide, Longdong and other districts to participate in this work.

    延安各机关
    将调大批干部
    参加土地征购
    【新华社延安九日电】陕甘宁边区政府，于去年公布征购土地条例草案，并派工作团试行结果，仅五个乡统计，农民即承购土地二万六千亩。征购时，对地主每人留地至少超过中农百分之五十，对富农基本利益并未侵犯。中农大部分均受过地主的欺骗剥削，在群众大会上，对恶霸地主的斗争，也积极参加，不少佃户中农，也承购到土地。获得土地的农民，生产热情立即高涨。绥德郝家桥的农民，正日夜加工修理农具，准备春耕。人们欢欣得手舞脚蹈地唱着：“减租减息半翻身，征购土地全翻身”，“土地是老家，农民是主人”。庆阳县王家塬乡征购土地后，百分之九十的农民组织起来。为争取彻底完成土地改革，延安各机关将抽调大批干部赴绥德、陇东等分区，参加该项工作。
