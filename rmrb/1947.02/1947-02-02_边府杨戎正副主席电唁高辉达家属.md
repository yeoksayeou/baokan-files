　　Border Region Government Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong Send Condolences to the Family of Gao Huida
To the Family of Comrade Gao Huida, via the Taiyue Administrative Office, Zhao Cheng:
    We are deeply saddened to learn of Comrade Gao Huida's heroic sacrifice in the Battle of Huma. To protect the interests of the people who had been emancipated, Comrade Gao Huida led the militia and resolutely fought against the ferocious enemy, demonstrating boundless ingenuity and bravery, and creating flexible tactics. He was a model for the entire border region's militia. His sacrifice is a true loss for the people, but Comrade Gao Huida's spirit will forever shine in the hearts of the people of the border region. We will annihilate more enemies to avenge Comrade Gao, until the final victory of the people. We send our condolences.
    Yang Xiufeng, Rong Wusheng, Government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region
