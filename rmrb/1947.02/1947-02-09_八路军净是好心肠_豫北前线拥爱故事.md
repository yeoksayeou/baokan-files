	"The Eighth Route Army is all good-hearted!" Stories of Support and Love on the豫North Henan Front
	Cao Xin
	It had just snowed, the sky was gloomy, and it was terribly cold.

	"Comrade, hurry, hurry and warm yourself, look at you, soaked to the bone." He Dongniang wiped the tears from her eyes, using a tone of utmost gratitude, speaking to Miao Hongxi, the clerk of the company headquarters, and Gao Changxiao, the communication soldier.

	A grass fire was burning brightly in his house, and lying on the kang (heated brick bed) was a nine-year-old child, just recovering—seriously ill.

	"I'm alright, as long as the child can be saved." Miao Hongxi didn't think he had done anything remarkable, answering with a comforting tone.

	He Dong's father put down the firewood in the village office, ran back panting, and seeing this scene, didn't say a word, picked up the wine bottle and left.

	He Dongniang remembered that there were dozens of eggs hidden in the inner room, and immediately took them out, stir-frying two large plates full.

	Seeing the situation was not good, Gao Changxiao picked up his wet socks and was about to run out, when he ran into He Dong's father head-on.

	"Comrade, quick, quickly drink some wine to warm your heart!" He Dong's father hurriedly pushed them into the house.

	"Comrade, don't be so distant, quickly eat some, you risked your lives to save my child, how can I repay this kindness?" He Dongniang pulled at them, saying.

	"I'm not good with words, but this is my true intention, you must take some, only then will I feel at ease." He Dong's father forcibly pressed them onto the chairs, reluctantly putting the chopsticks in their hands.

	"We are all one family, your child is just like our brother, how can we not save someone who is dying, this is our responsibility, it's nothing, we can't eat this wine and food," Changxiao said:

	"If you don't eat some, we're not one family, look at how wet your socks are, I can't even change them for you, you must take some." He Dong's father picked up the wine cup and was about to pour it for them.

	"If it weren't for your Eighth Route Army, this child would have been ruined, I'll recognize the child as yours, and in the future, we'll become relatives!" He Dongniang sincerely said to Miao Hongxi:

	"Don't do that, I'm only twenty-five years old, this would make me feel terribly ashamed." Miao Hongxi laughed.

	"You suffered such a great fright in the well, quickly drink some."

	Miao Hongxi and Gao Changxiao helplessly drank a few mouthfuls of wine, feeling that they really shouldn't accept this treat, and quickly ran back to the company headquarters.

	"I'm really scared when I think about it!" This child is really naughty, usually he wouldn't dare go near the well, the well is so deep, with two or three zhang (丈, a Chinese unit of measurement, approximately 3.3 meters) of water, good heavens, I don't know what happened? He went to grab the goat's horn and started fighting with the goat, the goat kicked, and kicked him into the well.

	"I was holding a little girl on the kang, his older brother and sister-in-law had gone out to pay New Year's visits and hadn't returned yet, his father was doing labor service, getting firewood in the village office, there wasn't a single man at home, his second brother (only twelve years old) came back and shouted, I was really so frightened that my soul left my body, I quickly went to the well and looked, the child had fallen into the well, face up, the neighbors in the back street lowered a well rope for him, the child grabbed it, so he didn't sink, shouting in the water, "Quickly pull me up, quickly pull me up!" his face frozen like a peanut shell.

	"We didn't dare pull the rope he was holding upwards, afraid that halfway up, his hands would freeze and let go, and he would fall down again, sink to the bottom, then it would be over, some people stood at the well's edge but didn't dare go down.

	"It really made me anxious, if we waited any longer, the child would freeze stiff, let go, and it would be over! I jumped, I cried, I howled, calling for help, but there was no way, so I ran into the company headquarters. The comrades' hearts were really good, they put down their work and rushed out, they couldn't understand what I was saying, before I could explain, one comrade straddled the edge of the well and went down.

	"That comrade was really capable, he went down and grabbed the child's arm, then lowered a basket, pressed the child into the basket and hoisted him up, going down the well, pulling the rope, it was all our Eighth Route Army.

	The child was frozen stiff, unable to even speak.

	I was dizzy with anxiety, turned around and went to get dry grass. The comrades were really amazing, not even thinking about whether they were cold, they picked up the wet child and ran to my house, just afraid of the child getting cold.

	The comrade who went down the well got his socks and trouser legs wet, not even warming himself, letting us warm the child first.

	If it weren't for the company headquarters, if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, even ten He Dongs would have been ruined.

	Truly risking one life to save another, the Eighth Route Army is neat and tidy, and their hearts are all good, I will repay this kindness…." He Dong's father then asked: "Comrade, you are sent by the regiment headquarters to investigate this matter, right? Then please report to the regimental commander for me, the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion of the ×× Regiment treats our ordinary people incredibly well, my child was saved by Miao Hongxi, the clerk of the company headquarters, Gao Changxiao, the communication soldier, Zuo Maosheng, Li Huangmao, and Zhou Miao, the medic.

	I will always remember these names in my heart, the Eighth Route Army is good, I will publicize it everywhere."

    “八路军净是好心肠”  豫北前线拥爱故事
    曹欣
    才下过雪，天阴沉沉地，冷得要命。
    “同志，你快，快烤一烤吧，看你这一身水。”和冬娘擦着眼眶里的泪珠，用万分感激的声调，向连部文书苗鸿喜和通讯员高长小说。
    干草火在他屋里熊熊地燃烧着，炕上躺着一个才缓过气来的九岁小孩—重病。
    “我不碍事，只要孩孩能救过来就好。”苗鸿喜并不觉得自己做了什么了不起的事，带着安慰的口吻回答。
    和冬爹在村公所里放下了柴草，气喘呼呼地跑了回来，看到这情景，一句话也没说，拿上酒瓶就走。
    和冬娘想起里间房里还藏了好几十颗鸡蛋，马上就拿出来，满满地炒了两大盘。
    高长小看情况不妙，掂上湿淋淋的袜子就要往外跑，迎头碰上了和冬爹。
    “同志，快，快喝上些酒暖暖心吧！”和冬爹赶忙把他们往屋里推。
    “同志，不要外气，快吃上些吧，你们破上命救了俺孩孩，这恩情我怎么报答你呀？”和冬娘拉扯着他们说。
    “我不会说话，这可是我的实心意，多少得用上些，我心里才过得去。”和冬爹硬把他们按在椅子上，把筷子勉强塞在他们手里。
    “咱们都是一家人，你家孩孩就跟俺兄弟一样，见死还能不救呀，这是我们的责任，这不算啥，咱可不吃这酒菜。”长小说：
    “不吃上些就不是一家人了，你看你袜子湿成啥了，我也不能给你换换，这你总得用上些。”和冬爹端起酒杯就要给他们灌。
    “要没有你们八路军，可把这孩孩毁了，我把孩孩认给你，今后咱们成个亲戚吧！”和冬娘真诚地对苗鸿喜说：
    “可不能，我才二十五岁，这可要把我愧死了。”苗鸿喜笑了。
    “你们在井里受了这样大的惊骇，快喝上些吧。”
    苗鸿喜和高长小无可奈何地喝了几口酒，心里实在觉得不应该受请，就赶紧跑回了连部。

    “我想起来真怕呀！”这孩孩真淘气得伤，平时他可不敢走近井边去，井可深了，就有二三丈水，老天爷，不知怎么闹的？他去抓住了羊角跟羊打起架了，羊一蹶，就把他蹶进了井里。
    “我正抱了个小妮妮孩在炕头上，他大哥、嫂子出去拜年还没回来，他爹当抗勤，在村公所里弄柴草，家里一个男人也没有，他二哥（才十二岁）回来一叫唤，我真骇得魂不附体，赶紧去井边一照，孩孩掉在井里，脸朝着天，后街的乡亲给他撩下了根井绳，孩孩抓住了它，算没沉下去，在水里直嚷“快捞我呀，快捞我呀！”脸冻得像花生壳一样。
    “拉在他手里的绳绳就不敢往上撮，怕撮到半当中，他冻脱了手，再跌下去，沉了底，那就完了，井圈上站了些人都不敢下。
    “真把我急死了啊，再停一会，孩一冻僵，一放手，就毁了！我又蹦，又跳，又哭，又嚎，叫救人，没法了，就窜进连部。同志们心真好，放下工作就窜出来，我说话他们听不懂，不等我把话说清，一个同志岔住井沿就下去了。
    “那同志真有本事呀，下去就抓住了孩孩的胳膀，又下了个篓子，把孩孩按在篓子里就吊上来了，下井，拉绳，都是咱八路军。
    孩孩冻得直挺挺地，连话也不会说。
    我急晕了，回头就去抱干草。同志们真算绝了，先不说自己冷不冷，抱上湿孩孩就往我家跑，只怕冻着孩孩。
    下井的那个同志袜子，裤腿都踩湿了，连烤也不烤，先让俺烤孩孩。
    要没有连部，没有八路军，就十个和冬也毁啦。
    真是破着一条命救了一条命，八路军齐齐整整地，净足好心肠，这场恩情我是要报的……。”和冬爹接着问：“同志，你们是团部派来调查这件事的吧？那请你替我向团长呈报，××团三营八连待咱们老百姓是好绝了，俺孩孩是连部文书苗鸿喜、通讯员高长小、左茂生、李黄毛，卫生员周苗救活的。
    这些名字我永远记在心里，八路军好，我是要向四处宣传的。”
