    Jiao Wubao

    Nineteen-year-old youth Jiao Wubao, with a slender body, carries a rifle as tall as himself. He is a model soldier and model mutual aid group leader of the Ninth Platoon, Fourth Company, of the Liberation Detachment. He grew up in a well-to-do family in Xiaoshizhuang, Gaoping. In the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), when the Kuomintang's 98th Army retreated, soldiers blocked the door of the village with machine guns, robbed him of his clothes and bedding, and pressed the muzzle of a gun against his chest, searching for more than ten silver dollars. From then on, an irrepressible hatred was branded on his young heart. In the same year, the Eighth Route Army came here, caring for the masses in every possible way, not taking even a needle or a thread. He was very moved, so at the age of eighteen, he voluntarily joined the Eighth Route Army. He said, "Our struggle is precisely for the future happiness of the people." He treats the work of the platoon as if it were his own, working diligently and conscientiously from morning till night. The troops departed from × County, marching ninety li along the rugged mountain road of Kulong Mountain, the hardship of which is unimaginable. However, seeing a soldier was tired, he disregarded his own fatigue and carried that soldier's rifle for more than twenty li. When they arrived at the encampment, the soldiers were all snoring and sleeping, but he, weary from the day, busied himself borrowing pots and bowls, making a fire and cooking. After the meal, he warmed a pot of hot water so that the soldiers could wash their feet. Only after he had done everything did he rest. He is usually the most able to help and care for new soldiers. He taught Cheng Beifang the aiming and shooting posture techniques on the training ground. Once, during a march, the whole platoon received eighteen jin of flour, and he carried it all day and all night. The platoon leader urged everyone to take turns carrying it, but before the platoon leader could finish speaking, he said, "Don't ask everyone to carry it. I don't feel tired carrying it. As long as our platoon doesn't have anyone lagging behind, I'll be happy." He always takes on more hardship himself, asking the new soldiers to rest more, which moved the new soldiers to voluntarily participate in the labor. New soldier Pang Tongshan said, "Wubao is really good to us, as close as blood brothers." He spoke what was in everyone's heart. Jiao Wubao can not only set an example and play a model role, but also has a new working method—solving the problems that arise among comrades ideologically. Every three to five days, he talks with the soldiers. Once, during a conversation, he learned that Pang Tongshan was homesick, so he immediately advised him, "Your home is now occupied by the Chiang army and you can't go back. Only by fighting back the Chiang army with peace of mind, then you can go home and see." Because he often talks with everyone, the platoon is very united and rarely has problems. Jiao Wubao is such a soldier; he has become the pillar of the whole platoon and the reliance of the soldiers.

    十九岁的青年焦五保，在那瘦削的身体上背起一支和他一样高低的步枪，他是解放支队四七部队九连九班的模范战士和模范互助组长。他生长在高平小柿庄一个饱暖的家庭里，民国三十年的秋天国民党九十八军溃退时，经过的村子，兵士们把机枪堵住门口抢去了他的衣服被子，枪口逼在他的胸膛上，搜去了拾几块现洋，从此在他幼小的心灵上烙下不可抑制的仇恨。同年八路军来到这里，一切爱护群众，不动一针一线，他非常感动，所以在十八岁那年便自动参加了八路军，他说：“我们的战斗，正是为了人民的未来幸福。”他把班里的工作当他自己的事情一样，从早到晚任劳任怨的干着。部队由×县出发，路经窟窿山崎岖的山路行军九十里，劳苦是可想而知，但他见一个战士累了自己就不顾疲劳把那个战士的步枪代扛了二十多里。到了宿营地，战士们都呼呼地睡起来，他却带着一天的倦困忙着借锅借碗，烧火煮饭，吃罢饭他又温着一锅热水，让战士们洗脚，一切事情都做完了他才休息。他在平时就最能帮助和爱护新战士，成北方的瞄准射击姿势要领都是他在操场上教习的。一次行军，全班领了十八斤面，他整整扛了一天一夜，班长动员大家轮流扛，可是没等班长说完，他就说：“不要叫大家扛，我扛着并不累，只要咱班没有一个掉队的，我心里就高兴了。”他屡次都是自己多吃苦，叫新战士多休息，把新战士感动的自动参加劳动。新战士庞铜山说：“五保对我们可真好，跟亲兄弟一样的亲。”他一个人说出了大家心里的话。焦五保不但能以身作则起模范作用，而且有一套新的工作方法——从思想上解决同志间所发生的问题，每隔三五天找战士们谈心，有一次谈心中了解了庞铜山想家，就立刻劝他说：“你的家现在是蒋军占领区，不能回去，只有安心的打退蒋军，那时才好回家看看”。由于他经常和大家谈心，班里的团结很好，很少发生问题。焦五保就是这样的一个战士，他成了全班的支柱和战士的依靠。
