　　Jiaxiang Masses Complain and Settle Scores
　　[This newspaper's dispatch from JiluYu, 31st] After Jiaxiang was recovered, our democratic government led the masses to take revenge and recover the land of the peasants. During the three months that Jiaxiang was occupied by the Chiang army, local rogues, secret agents and reactionary landlords carried out extremely cruel massacres against the people. After the recovery of Jiaxiang, because we did not immediately mobilize the masses to take revenge, the emotions of the masses appeared dull. However, after the leadership further understood the demands of the masses, everyone unanimously believed that opposing Chiang, taking revenge, and returning the land home were the current direction of work. The people's blood debts must be settled, and murderers must be resolutely suppressed. They loudly proposed "a life for a life," "return the grain," and provide relief to the families of the victims, and avenge the dead, in order to ignite the people's anger and then reclaim their land. After this policy was determined, the emotions of cadres and the masses gradually rose. At the anti-Chiang revenge meeting held in the Zhifang District, the dead were mourned, the families of the murderers wore mourning clothes for the dead, the martyrs were buried, and the people's accumulated anger was vented. From daring not to hold meetings to daring to hold meetings, from daring not to ask for grain to daring to ask for grain, and to obtain their own land.

　　嘉祥群众诉苦清算
    【本报冀鲁豫卅一日电】嘉祥收复后，我民主政府领导群众起来报仇雪恨，要回农民的土地。嘉祥被蒋军侵占的三个月中，曾与地方流氓特务与反动地主，对人民进行了极其残酷的屠杀。嘉祥收复之后，由于我们没有立即发动群众报仇，因而群众情绪表现沉闷，但当领导上进一步了解群众要求之后，大家一致认为反蒋报仇，土地回家，是当前的工作方向，人民的血海深仇必需清算，对杀人凶犯必须坚决镇压，响亮的提出“杀人偿命”，“倒粮还粮”，救济死难家属，为死者复仇，以此去燃起人民的怒火，进而要回自己的土地。此方针确定后，干部及群众情绪逐渐高涨。在纸房区召开的反蒋复仇大会，追悼了死者，凶手家属为死者披麻带孝，给烈士安葬，人民的积愤得以倾吐，由不敢开会到敢开会，不敢要粮到敢要粮，及取得自己土地。
