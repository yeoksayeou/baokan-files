[This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch of the 8th] Yanggu Second District, Yuzhuang, the local tyrant landlord Sun Xingjin, sabotaged land reform. After the government resolutely supported the masses, it shattered the deception of the fake peasant association. Yuzhuang is a key village in the Second District, but landlords and local bullies still rule the masses, control a few lackeys, and create clan struggles in the village, attempting to preserve their ruling position. For more than two years, the masses have not been able to turn themselves around. When this land reform movement began, the government supported the masses and detained five people, including the landlords and local bullies Sun Xingrang and Sun Xicheng. However, Sun Xingxu's brother, Sun Xingjin, secretly carried out activities, colluding with peasant association member Gao Erhuai and others to organize a fake peasant association controlled by him, and demanded that Sun Xingrang and others be released back to the village for struggle. Under Sun Xingjin's activities, the masses only dared to raise some minor opinions: such as not allowing them to pick firewood, not allowing them to walk on his land, etc. When a few masses mentioned his crimes of colluding with the enemy and killing people, Gao Erhuai immediately said: "We, old and young, must rely on our conscience! If there is any, we will mention it, if there is none, we will mention it to others. Just talking about someone killing people, where is the knife, where is the blood?" No one spoke anymore. District cadres saw that something was wrong, so they detained Erhuai to allow the masses to express their opinions, and everyone spoke their true feelings. After a few days of education, Gao Erhuai also realized and said: "That night when the meeting was held, Sun Xingjin gave the idea, he said he would tell me to say whatever he told me to say." The masses said that Erhuai had become someone else's running dog. After this exposure, the masses rose up to fight the landlords and local bullies, and the next morning they took out all their floating wealth for distribution and began to investigate his land.
[This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch of the 9th] Yanggu Wudikou Village disbanded the Black Peasant Association, and the masses truly mobilized. The village has more than 160 households. Some of the masses who had been traitors and bandits often said, "Better to cross Jiujiangkou than to cross Wudikou." The masses had never been mobilized. A few past traitorous hooligan elements organized more than a dozen masses from the west of the village, pulled away a rich peasant's cattle from the east and took away the grain. At that time, the big hooligan Li Weikui in the east also organized the households in the east to fight against the west. District cadres went to the village to understand the situation, convened a village meeting, separated the bad elements and the masses at the meeting, and then more than forty people joined the peasant association. The next day, when the meeting was held, the masses boldly raised their opinions and struggled against the local tyrant landlord Yu Zixiang, and took out his farm tools, livestock, and other things to continue the investigation of land.

    揭破地主假农会
    斗倒恶霸分土地
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】阳谷二区于庄恶霸地主孙兴津破坏土地改革，政府坚决撑腰后，击碎假农会的欺骗。于庄是二区的一个重点村，但地主恶霸仍然统治群众，掌握着几个狗腿，制造村内宗派斗争，企图保全其统治地位，二年多来群众未得翻身。这次土地改革运动开始，政府为群众撑腰，把地主恶霸孙兴让、孙希成等五人扣起来。但地主孙兴需之弟孙兴津又暗中活动，拉拢农会委员高二坏等，组织由他操纵的假农会，并要求保回孙兴让等回村斗争。在孙兴津活动下群众只敢提了些小意见：如柴不叫拾啦，不叫在他地里走等，有群众少一提他通敌杀人的罪恶，高二坏即说：“咱老少爷们都要凭良心啊！有的咱就提，没有的给别人家提，光说人家杀人来，刀在那里，血在那里？”群众没人再说话了。区干部看出了这有鬼，即把二坏扣起让群众提意见，大家才谈出真心话。经过几天教育，高二坏也觉悟说：“那天晚上开会时，孙兴津给出主意，他说他叫俺说啥俺就说啥。”群众说二坏是当了人家走狗了。经过这样揭发，群众起来斗了地主恶霸，第二天一早便把他们的浮财全部拿出来分配，并进行清查他的土地。
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】阳谷武堤口村解散黑农会，群众真正动起来。该村共有一百六十余户人家，有些当过奸汉和土匪的群众常说：“能过九江口，不过五堤口，”群众也没发动过。几个过去的奸汉的流氓分子，组织起村西的十多个群众，把东头一个富农的牛拉走粮食装走。当时东头的大流氓李伟魁便把东头的各门各户也都组织起来，和西头斗争。区干部到这村了解了情况，召集了村民大会，把坏分子和群众在会上分开，接着就有四十多个人参加了农会，第二天开会，群众都很大胆的把意见提来，斗争了恶霸地主于子祥，把他的农具和牲口等东西都弄出来，继续清查土地。
