　　[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bureau Party School, in response to Comrade Bo Yibo's call for production and thrift, has launched a school-wide upsurge in production and thrift. Following a general mobilization meeting on the 12th, various production groups were quickly established within two or three days. The farming group searched everywhere for wasteland to cultivate, building brick toilets to accumulate fertilizer; the textile group busied itself finding spinning wheels and cotton, with some already starting to spin yarn; the tofu group's daily production of tofu was sufficient for eight kitchens; the bean sprout group began producing vegetables; the cigarette rolling group purchased cigarette rolling machines and raw materials. In addition, a shoe-making group, a barber group, and a lime group were also formally organized. In terms of thrift: six administrative personnel in the North Kitchen saved clothing, bedding, etc., equivalent to over 2,000 jin of millet; eight comrades in the supply section saved over 1,900 jin of millet. Currently, everyone has set individual production and thrift plans, launching a heated competition. According to preliminary calculations, the total personal production this year could reach around 40,000 jin of millet, and savings will be over 15,000 jin. (Guang)

　　中央局党校全体动员起来
    学习空隙中进行生产
    【本报讯】中央局党校响应薄一波同志生产节约号召，全校掀起生产节约热潮。经十二日全体动员大会后，各种生产小组两三天内纷纷成立起来。种地组四出寻找荒地，砖筑厕所积肥；纺织组忙于找车纺花，有的已经开始纺线；豆腐组每天出的豆腐已足供八个灶用；豆芽组开始出菜；卷烟组采购卷烟机与原料。此外，做鞋组、理发组、石灰组也都正式组织起来。在节约方面：北灶六位事务人员节约被服等合小米二千多斤；供给科八位同志节约小米一千九百多斤。现每人均订出生产节约计划，展开热烈竞赛。据初步计算：本年个人生产总量可达小米四万斤上下，节约数将在一万五千斤以上。（光）
