Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th -- The Jiang-controlled "Returning Home Corps" dispatched to Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have three major weaknesses and two major contradictions:

The first weakness is being enemies of the people. The "Returning Home Corps" is largely composed of traitors and local bullies who already owe the people a debt of blood. Moreover, under the protection of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, they are carrying out so-called "land restoration" and "rent reversal," engaging in widespread burning, killing, and looting, which has further aroused the opposition of people from all walks of life.

The second weakness is economic difficulty and inability to sustain themselves. The "Returning Home Corps" is entirely self-funded, and their food, clothing, and supplies all rely on looting. However, the limited wealth they plunder mostly ends up in the pockets of a few leaders, so their actual difficulties cannot be resolved.

The third is a lack of combat effectiveness and a fear of death. Many of them don't even know how to fire a gun, and they often run away as soon as they hear gunfire.

The two major internal contradictions are:

First, the contradiction with the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The Chiang Kai-shek troops treat the "Returning Home Corps" as a shield. During marches, the "Returning Home Corps" are driven to the front as scouts; when stationed, the "Returning Home Corps" are placed on the periphery. When battles occur, the Chiang Kai-shek troops do not provide assistance. The "Returning Home Corps" must even guarantee they will not be beaten if they ask the Chiang Kai-shek troops to come to the countryside. For example, the "Returning Home Corps" of Zhanghe Township, Jinsha District (north of Haimen), once asked the Chiang Kai-shek troops to come to the countryside, but they were ambushed by the militia, resulting in more than 20 casualties. The members of the "Returning Home Corps" were then imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek troops and ordered to compensate ten dan of cotton per person.

Second, the contradiction between the new and old "Returning Home Corps" members. New members are assigned low-level positions, and their property is forced to be used to buy guns and ammunition, making it impossible for them to make a living.

    苏皖蒋记“还乡团”
    三大弱点两大矛盾
    【新华社华中六日电】派来苏皖之蒋记“还乡团”具有三大弱点两大矛盾：第一个弱点与人民为敌，“还乡团”成份多是汉奸恶霸，本来就欠下人民一笔血债，加上在蒋军庇护下进行所谓“复田”“倒租”，普遍烧杀抢掠，更激起各阶层人民的反对。第二个弱点是经济困难，不能持久。“还乡团”经费全部自给，衣食用品全靠抢掠，而抢掠有限的资财，因多入少数头目私囊，实际困难不能解决。第三是无战斗力，贪生怕死。好些人连枪也不会打，往往一闻枪声，即飞奔逃命。两大内部矛盾：一是与蒋军的矛盾，蒋军把“还乡团”当挡箭牌，每次行军时，“还乡团”被驱作尖兵；驻扎时“还乡团”被放在外围，发生战斗时，蒋军不予救援，“还乡团”请蒋军下乡还得保证不挨打。如金沙区（海门北）张河乡“还乡团”，一次请蒋军下乡，全遭民兵伏击，死伤二十余人，该“还乡团”员即被蒋军监禁，并勒令赔偿每人十担棉花。二是新老“还乡团”的矛盾，新团员被分配低微职务，财产被迫拿出买枪弹，弄得无法生活。
