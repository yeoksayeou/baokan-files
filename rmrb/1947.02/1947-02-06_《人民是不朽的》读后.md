    Reflections After Reading "The People Are Immortal"
    Lu Zhimo
    "The People Are Immortal" is a war novel by the Soviet writer Vasily Grossman. This book played a significant role in the Soviet Patriotic War. Now that reprinted editions are circulating in the liberated areas, it offers many insights for the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas who are currently engaged in a war of self-defense.

    What does it tell us?

    First, it makes us more confident that the people's army, in a just war, will inevitably triumph in the end, no matter how many difficulties it faces at the beginning.

    The author scientifically and objectively analyzes the fundamental differences between the Soviet and German armies. In analyzing the German army, he acknowledges its advantages in organizational integrity and precise calculation. However, more importantly, even when the German army is winning victories, he clearly sees the serious and insurmountable weaknesses inherent within it, namely that "in their complex and enormous operations of commanding millions of troops based on discipline rather than thought, there is something degenerate, something incompatible with the free spirit of man; their culture is not an intellectual culture, but an instinctive civilization, similar in nature to the organization of ants and livestock." Therefore, the conclusion is that "they will never conquer our country."

    Let's compare this to the Chiang army led by current traitors! With the help of their American masters, they should be acknowledged as superior in terms of equipment, but their composition relies entirely on the two magic weapons of oppression and deception. As for organization, calculation, and internal secret service rule, they are inferior even to their big brother Hitler's army. The Chiang army is like a chaotic swarm of locusts, and it is extremely obvious and certain that they will be wiped out under the attack of our awakened and emancipated people's army, which possesses a fully free spirit and intellectual culture.

    The author also writes about how the Soviet people learned to love and hate. The soldier Ignatiev learns to hate in the course of the war. It is precisely because the Soviet people deeply love their lives and the happiness that the Soviet system gives them that they have unparalleled hatred for the fascist beasts who destroy their peaceful happiness. This love is love for freedom and labor, and this hate is hate for oppression and exploitation. Our soldiers and masses also have this lesson before them: to learn to love and hate: love the freedom and labor of the liberated areas after emancipation; hate the oppression of American imperialism and the cruel and shameless feudal comprador exploitation of the Chiang family. It is the responsibility of writers to write about this love and hate and further educate the people to love and hate.

    Second, it helps us understand the tactical spirit of the people's army.

    This combat spirit is first and foremost active, offensive, and annihilating. After a successful attack on a village, everyone is elated, but Bogolyubov criticizes the regimental commander Mayer Salov: "You didn't command very well!" because he let enemies who could have been annihilated escape. This teaches some of our troops' lower-level cadres that they should not only accept lessons when things are difficult or failing, but also not neglect shortcomings or abandon inspection after a victory, and should see if the operation has achieved the goal of fully annihilating the enemy.

    When the military commissar of the battalion, Bogolyubov, is planning a breakout in the forest, Rumiantsev plans it very carefully, so that they can sneak past safely. But Bogolyubov criticizes him as "absurd." He advocates "giving the enemy a blow from behind, inflicting the greatest possible losses on him, and then we will break out victoriously!"

    Secondly, it points out that the guidance of modern warfare requires a high degree of calculation and organization, requires mobility, flexibility, and coordinated action, and requires learning warfare in warfare.

    Mayer Salov, a Soviet hero who won medals for his bravery in battle and personally led the reconnaissance company at the front, also has his shortcomings. He neglects the control of the entire unit, and he lacks planning and organization. Bogolyubov criticizes him by saying that it is not enough just to be brave, but more importantly, "you should use your brain until beads of sweat break out on your forehead." In our current war of self-defense, it is also necessary not only to be "brave" but also to "use our brains," that is, to have commanders who are both intelligent and brave.

    However, Mayer Salov was tested, developed, and discovered himself in the war, and he understood that "this spirit of not fearing death cannot be regarded as having fulfilled his responsibility in commanding the battle." In the war, when the German commander complacently said, "The Russians distribute the pressure evenly across the entire line, and a frontal attack comes, which they call a 'head-on blow'..." But before he could finish laughing, Mayer Salov's troops had already struck his headquarters, "He who laughs last laughs best!"

    Third, the author uses a vivid type of military commissar (equivalent to our political commissar) to portray the political leadership in the people's army who adheres to principles, overcomes biases, and connects with the masses.

    The battalion military commissar, Bogolyubov, carefully studies specific materials and makes a correct comparison between the enemy and ourselves, thereby strengthening his confidence in victory. He does not let go of any remarks that may affect the combat mood, and his thinking is sharp and clear. Mishansky boasted about the enemy's strength in the regimental headquarters, and Bogolyubov immediately gave him a severe criticism: "Psychologically, you are someone who has been retired for a long time, and your voice has a tone of willingness to surrender!"

    In the forest surrounded by the enemy, he severely punished the escapists and changed the mood of the troops. He did not hide the danger from the troops, but instead boosted their confidence in the struggle. The impression of Bogolyubov among his comrades was "an inviolable force, he is stern and harsh!"

    However, he did not make the soldiers afraid and dare not approach because of his sternness and harshness. Because of his consistency in word and deed, setting an example with his own actions, he gave the soldiers strength and confidence, shared the joys and sorrows with them, and won the sincere support of the soldiers. In the most difficult times, the soldiers gathered their last bit of tobacco and gave it to Bogolyubov: "Our commissar hasn't slept for several nights! He's always studying maps, it's best to let him have a puff of smoke!"

    Finally, this is a novel with thought. As Mao Dun said in the preface: "Our Chinese writers should pay special attention to it. The statement of overemphasizing the sense of real life is naturally more correct than emphasizing skills, but if the ideological foundation is neglected, the sense of real life will also be rootless, and people and things cannot be seen deeply and correctly." In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, very few good war novels appeared. Not being able to see, not being able to see accurately, and lacking deep thought cannot be said to be a reason. How to correct this? This requires writers to not only experience, but also to deeply think and analyze the current great patriotic self-defense war with Mao Zedong Thought.

### 《人民是不朽的》读后

    《人民是不朽的》读后
    鲁之沫
    《人民是不朽的》是苏联格罗斯曼著的战争小说。这本书在苏联的爱国自卫战争中起过很大的作用。现在解放区已经有了翻印本流行，对于正在展开着自卫战争的解放区军民来说，也有很多的启示。
    他启示我们一些什么呢？
    首先使我们更加确信：人民的军队在正义的战争中，不论开始有多少困难，最后必然胜利。
    著者科学地客观地分析了苏德两方军队本质的不同。在分析德军时，承认他的组织完整计算精密的优点，然而更重要的是，在德军着着胜利的时候，明眼看出它本身包含着严重的不可克服的弱点，即是在“他们的这种不要思想，但凭纪律以指挥数百万大军的复杂而庞大的行动中，却有着一些退化的东西，和人的自由精神不相容的东西，他们的，不是理知的文化，而是本能的文明，在性质上是和蚂蚁及牲畜的组织性有些相同。”因而所得的结论是“他们永远不能征服我们的国度”。
    把当前卖国贼统率的蒋军对比着看看吧！在装备上由于他美国主子的帮助，应当承认是优越一些的，而其组成却全靠压迫和欺骗两件法宝。至于组织，计算，以及其内部的特务统治，较其大哥希特拉的军队，则比都比不上。蒋军正像一群乱哄哄的蝗虫，在我们觉悟了翻身了的具有充分自由精神、理知文化的人民军队打击之下，必被扑灭，当然是极为明显，也极为肯定的结论。
    作者又写出了苏联人民怎样学习了爱与恨。士兵伊格那底也夫在战争的过程中学会了憎恨。正因为苏联人民极度的热爱自己的生活，热爱苏维埃制度给予自己的幸福，所以对于那些破坏他们和平幸福的法西斯野兽，也就无比的憎恨。这种爱是爱自由、劳动，恨是恨压迫、剥削。在我们的战士和群众们面前也有这一课，学习爱与恨：爱翻身后解放区的自由、劳动；恨美帝国主义的压迫和蒋家残酷无耻的封建买办剥削。作家们的责任就是把这种爱与恨写出来，更教育人民去爱与恨。
    第二、使我们领会了人民的军队的战术精神。
    这种作战精神首先是积极的、进攻的、歼灭性的。在进攻一个村庄胜利以后，大家都兴高采烈，然而包加列夫却批评了团长迈尔彩洛夫：“你指挥的不太好！”因为放走了可以歼灭的敌人。这教育着我们的部队有些下级干部，不仅是在困难的时候、失败的时候才肯接受教训；就是在胜利之后，也不要忽视了缺点、放弃了检查，应看看作战是否达到了充分歼敌的目的。
    营军事委员包加列夫在森林中计划突围的时候，路米扬来夫计划得十分周密，可以安安全全的偷跑过去，而包加列夫则批评他“荒唐”。他主张“从敌人后面给他一个打击，使他蒙受最大损失，然后我们再胜利突围而去！”
    其次是指出近代战争的指导，需要高度的计算和组织，需要机动、灵活和协同动作，需要在战争中来学习战争。
    迈尔彩洛夫，一个苏联英雄，战斗中勇敢得过勋章，在战斗中亲自带着债察连跑在最前面，然而他的缺点也正在这里，他忽视整个部队的掌握，他缺乏计划性与组织性，包加列夫批评他的就是：不仅仅是需要你的勇敢，更重要的是“应该用脑筋，直到汗珠钻出在额角”。在我们当前的自卫战争中，也同样是不仅需要“勇猛”，而且需要“用脑筋”，就是说需要智勇双全的指挥员。
    然而迈尔彩洛夫在战争中，经受了考验，发展和发现了自己，他了解了“这种不惜一死的精神，并不能算是他已经尽了指挥作战的责任”。在战争中当德军的指挥官洋洋自得的说：“俄罗斯人是把压力平均分配全线，而正面进攻来了，这个他们称之谓‘迎头痛击’……”然而在他还未笑完的时候，迈尔彩洛夫的部队，已打到了他的司令部了，“谁笑的最后，谁笑的最好！”
    第三、作者用一个军事委员（相当于我们的政治委员）的活生生的典型，刻划出人民军队中坚持原则，克服偏向，而又连系群众的政治领导。
    营军事委员包加列夫，仔细研究具体材料，对敌我双方作出正确的对比，因而坚定了胜利的信心。他不放松任何足以影响作战情绪的言论，他的思想是尖锐而清醒的。弥香斯基在团部夸耀着敌人的强大，包加列夫立即给以严厉的批评：“在心理上你却是一个早已退休了许多时候的，你的声音里就有甘愿屈服的调子！”
    在被敌人包围的森林中，严厉的处罚了逃跑主义者，转变了部队的情绪，他不向部队隐蔽危险，却鼓起了部队斗争的信心，包加列夫在他们同伴中的印象是“一个凛然不可侵犯的力量，他是严厉与苛刻的！”
    然而他却不因严厉与苛刻，而使士兵害怕，不敢接近，正因他的言行一致，以身作则，给了士兵以力量和信心，同甘苦，共患难，而得到士兵真诚的拥戴，在最困难时，战士们把自己最后的一点烟，凑起来，送给包加列夫“我们的委员几夜没睡觉了！老是研究地图，最好是让他有一口烟抽抽！”
    最后，这是一本有思想的小说。正如茅盾在序中所说：“我们中国作家实在应当特别注意。过分强调生活实感的说法，自然要比强调技巧要正确得多，然而忽略了思想基础，则生活实感亦将无根，看事看人都不能深入而正确的。”抗战八年，极少好的战争小说出现，看不出，看不准，缺乏深刻思想，不能说不是一个原因。怎样改正呢？那就要求作家们，不仅体验，而且要用毛泽东思想深入思考分析当前的伟大爱国自卫战争。
