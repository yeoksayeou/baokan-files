　　The Sino-American Commercial Treaty and the Twenty-One Demands
　　Moye
　　The Chinese people endured eight years of hardship and sacrifice, shedding countless blood and sweat, and finally defeated the heinous Japanese fascist imperialism, winning the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Consequently, the "May Ninth National Humiliation," for which so many patriotic individuals had tirelessly advocated, even to the point of cutting off their fingers and writing in blood, was also wiped clean with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. However, in no time at all, the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek has once again branded the suffering and precarious Chinese nation with a new national humiliation. The symbol of this new national humiliation is the Sino-American Commercial Treaty signed by the traitor Chiang and his master, American imperialism, on November 4, 1946!
　　Although, in essence, both the Twenty-One Demands and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty are indentures that sell out the interests of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, judging from the scope and depth, the latter can indeed be said to have "surpassed the former"! According to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, China is completely open to the United States, and American imperialism can do whatever it wants in China. American enterprises enjoy various special treatments, and China has completely forfeited its tariff autonomy, coastal and inland navigation rights, and so on. This unlimited economic control that American imperialism has obtained from Chiang Kai-shek is the basis for its unlimited political and military control over the Chiang regime. As an economist said: According to the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, "China will no longer be a China for the Chinese, but a China for the Americans!" Chiang's treachery is so generous and thorough that it can be described as "a sight to behold"!
　　In the Twenty-One Demands, Yuan Shikai mainly sold out the special rights of Shandong and Manchuria and Inner Mongolia to Japanese imperialism, while all the special rights that Chiang Kai-shek sold out to American imperialism in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty are spread throughout the "entire territory" of China. Article 1, Section 3 of the Twenty-One Demands: The Chinese government promises to open suitable places in Shandong Province as commercial ports. Article 2, Section 3: Japanese subjects will be allowed to reside, travel, and conduct business in Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia at will. Let's take a look at the Sino-American Commercial Treaty: Article 2: "(1) Nationals of either Contracting Party (should read as the United States – note by Moye) shall be permitted to enter the territory of the other Contracting Party (should read as China – note by Moye) and shall be permitted to reside, travel and operate within the entire territory. ... and shall not be required to apply for or carry any enforcement documents other than (A) a valid passport or (B) other identification documents issued by its national authority." Article 3: "... agree that corporations and associations of either Contracting Party may engage in commercial manufacturing processing finance, science, education, religious and charitable activities within the entire territory of the other Contracting Party, and acquire, hold, construct or lease and occupy suitable houses for the purpose of commercial construction processing finance, science, education, religion and charity, and lease appropriate land..." This means that China is full of commercial ports and activities of American imperialism, and Americans can go to any place in China to carry out any collusion. Article 2, Section 4 of the Twenty-One Demands: The Chinese government shall grant Japanese subjects the right to exploit all mines in Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia. Regarding this transaction, the Sino-American Commercial Treaty stipulates it more cleverly and extensively: "...with respect to the ownership of shares in corporations and associations of the other Contracting Party engaged in business on public land of the other Contracting Party, according to the provisions of this section, either Contracting Party shall not be required to grant its nationals, corporations and associations rights and preferences superior to those obtained by its nationals, corporations and associations from the other Contracting Party." (Article 4, Section 1) In fact, Chiang Kai-shek had already sold the rights to explore and extract oil in Northwest China to the American Universal Company, and twenty-five wells in the Gobi Desert are already under exploitation. Last July, the American Reynolds Company announced that it would operate aluminum mines in Shandong, Taiwan, and Northeast China. Recently, the Chiang government sold all the mining rights of special metals related to national defense in Hunan—antimony, manganese, etc.—to American imperialism. Article 3 of the Twenty-One Demands stipulates that the Hanyehping Company should be operated as a joint venture between China and Japan. However, Chiang Kai-shek is even more generous: "Nationals, corporations and associations of either Contracting Party shall, within the entire territory of the other Contracting Party, have the right to organize and participate in the corporations and associations of the other Contracting Party, to engage in commercial manufacturing processing scientific education religious and charitable activities," (Article 4, Section 2) Compared with a Sino-Japanese "joint venture" Hanyehping Company and countless Sino-American "joint venture" legal entities of various kinds (not to mention the American sole proprietorship), it is really "a minor sorcerer in the presence of a great one." Article 4 of the Twenty-One Demands is: The Chinese government shall not cede or lease all Chinese coastal harbors and islands to other countries. Admittedly, there is no such express provision in the published Sino-American Commercial Treaty, but we know that the negotiation of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was completely secret, and it is only a part of the Chiang-American secret agreement that has been revealed. According to the Shanghai "News and Communications" report in September last year: The sale of American surplus materials to China is attached with a secret agreement for a 30-year dock agreement. According to this agreement, all Chinese seaports can be freely accessed and used by American warships within 30 years. (Note: Article 22, Section 5 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty: If a vessel of either Contracting Party is forced to take refuge in any port, place or territorial waters of the other Contracting Party that is not open to foreign trade or navigation due to severe weather or any other distress, such vessel shall be accorded friendly treatment and assistance, and the necessary and existing supplies and repair equipment. This section shall also apply to warships and fishing vessels and vessels provided for in Section 2 of Article 21.) In fact, Shanghai, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, and even Keelung and Kaohsiung in Taiwan, have become bases for American imperialism today. Regarding the coastal harbors and islands of China, if Yuan Shikai opened a check to the Japanese invaders, then today Chiang Kai-shek has already cashed it to American imperialism.
　　What Yuan Shikai admitted and did, Chiang Kai-shek has already admitted and done, without any less, but more; and what Yuan Shikai did not dare to admit and did not dare to do back then, the traitor Chiang actually brazenly admitted and did regardless of everything!
　　Except for Item 6 (regarding the economic rights and interests of Fujian), Yuan Shikai did not dare to admit the remaining items of Article 5 of the Twenty-One Demands. Item 1: The Chinese government must hire Japanese people as consultants for military, financial, and political affairs. This item has long been done by Chiang Kai-shek to American imperialism. Not only are individual consultants hired, but also a "military advisory group" of four or five thousand people. As for Li Du, Savage, etc., and what American generals, doctors, and the like, are too numerous to mention in Chiang Kai-shek's child emperor's court. Item 2: All Japanese hospitals, temples, schools, etc. established in the Chinese mainland are permitted to own land. Regarding this requirement, the traitor Chiang has also admitted to American imperialism, and has added to it. Article 8, Section 1 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty: "Nationals, corporations and associations of either Contracting Party shall be permitted, within the entire territory of the other Contracting Party, to acquire, hold and dispose of real estate and other immovable property." Item 3 is: The police in necessary places shall be jointly operated by China and Japan, or Japanese people shall be hired in the police offices in these places to improve the Chinese police organization. This requirement is very vicious, but Chiang Kai-shek has already done it to American imperialism. The "Sino-American Cooperative Office" jointly operated by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek has long completely ruled the Kuomintang's police and secret agents. The so-called "Sino-American Secret Agent Training Class" has spread all over the country—last November, the so-called "Sino-American Police and Military Police Liaison Office" was established in Beiping to implement the joint operation of Sino-American police and military police. Recently, Bullmoore, the former chief of the Barclay Police Bureau in the United States, was invited by Chiang Kai-shek to "reform the Chinese police administration." Item 4 is: Japan shall purchase a certain amount of armaments. As everyone knows, the armaments supplied by American imperialism to the traitor Chiang for the civil war far exceed the "certain amount." Item 5 is: Permission shall be granted to Japan to build railways connecting Wuchang and Jiujiang Nanchang, and railways between Nanchang and Hangzhou, and between Nanchang and Chaozhou. According to the Jiangji Peace Daily on October 12 last year, Deputy Director Liu of the Yuehan Railway Bureau told our reporter: The United States and China will jointly build the Yuehan Railway, and the United States is willing to lend 500 million US dollars, and all materials must be purchased in the United States. The loan will be used in part to build the Yellow River Railway Bridge, and all engineering plans have been undertaken by American construction companies. It is clear that the "construction rights" of the Yuehan and Pinghan railways have been presented by the traitor Chiang to his American father. Item 7 is: Japanese people are allowed to preach in China. This is also carefully considered and not omitted in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty: "Nationals of either Contracting Party shall, within the entire territory of the other Contracting Party, be permitted to exercise freedom of belief and worship, and to establish schools to educate their children, and to conduct religious ceremonies and preach or impart other knowledge in their own homes or any other suitable buildings, alone, collectively or in religious or educational corporations and associations, without any hindrance or disturbance due to religious belief or other reasons." (Article 12, Section 1)
　　The people's historians have long drawn a conclusion on Yuan Shikai's being a great traitor. It is by no means writing a reversal article here to exonerate him; but rather, it is intended to use a comparison of some historical facts to enable us to more deeply understand how unprecedentedly shameless and ugly Chiang Kai-shek's crime of selling out the country today is! Yuan Shikai conspired to restore the imperial system himself. In order to obtain the assistance of Japanese imperialism to achieve this goal, he did not hesitate to "sell out the country for glory," disregarding the national destiny and the people's lives, and accepted the Twenty-One Demands of the Japanese invaders. More than thirty years later, today, in order to persist in the anti-people civil war, in order to maintain the feudal compradore fascist dictatorship of the four major families, Chiang Kai-shek inherited the mantle of selling out the country of "rather giving to friendly countries than to domestic slaves," and signed the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, a great collection of treaties that sell out the country from ancient and modern times, with increased intensity. But we know that the wheels of the era, driven by the will and power of the people, are upright and ruthless towards the great dictator and traitor. The Twenty-One Demands did not save Yuan Shikai's dying fate. The result was still a "New China Spring Dream," a disgrace. The previous lesson can be a warning. Chiang Kai-shek should use this mirror of history to look at himself.

　　蒋美商约与二十一条
    漠野
    中国人民曾经八年困苦艰辛的岁月，支付了无数血汗头颅，终于击败了穷凶极恶的日本法西斯帝国主义，赢得了抗战胜利，从而，多少爱国志士曾为之奔走呼号断指血书的“五九国耻”，也就随着抗战的胜利而一并湔雪了；可是，曾几何时，民贼独夫蒋介石又给灾难深重万庆苏苏的中华民族烙印上了一个新的国耻，这个新国耻的标志，便是一九四六年十一月四日蒋贼与其主子美帝国主义所签订的蒋美商约！
    虽然，在本质上，二十一条与蒋美商约都是出卖中华民族与中国人民之权益的卖身契约，但就其范围之大小与程度之深浅来较量，则后者的确可以说是“后来居上”！根据蒋美商约，中国对美一切开放，美帝国主义在中国可以为所欲为，美国企业享受了各种特殊待遇，中国完全断送了关税自主权、沿海及内河航行权等等。美帝国主义从蒋介石手里所取得的这种经济上的无限控制权，乃是其政治上军事上对蒋政权握有无限控制权的张本。诚如某经济学者所说：根据蒋美商约，“中国将不是中国人的中国，而是美国人的中国了！”蒋贼卖国之慷慨彻底，可谓“叹观止矣”！
    在二十一条中，袁世凯所出卖给日本帝国主义的主要是山东与满蒙的特权，而蒋介石在蒋美商约中出卖给美帝国主义的一切特权，却普及于中国的“领土全境”。二十一条第一号第三项：中国政府允诺开山东省内合宜地方为商埠。第二号第三项：日本臣民将在满洲及东部内蒙古任便居住来往，并经营商业等项生意。我们再看看蒋美商约吧：该约第二条：“（一）缔约此方（应读作美国——野注）之国民，应许其进入缔约彼方（应读作中国——野注）之领土，并许其在该领土全境内居住旅行及经营。………并除其本国主管官厅所发给之（甲）有效护照或（乙）其他身份证明文件外，应无须申请或携带任何执行文件。”第三条：“………同意缔约此方之法人及团体在缔约彼方领土全境内，从事经营商务制造加工金融、科学、教育、宗教及慈善事业，为商务建造加工金融、科学、教育、宗教及慈善之目的，而取得保有建造或租赁及占有适当之房屋，并租赁适当之土地，……”这就是说，中国到处都是美帝国主义的商埠与活动的所在，美国人可以到中国任何地方去进行任何的勾当。二十一条第二号第四项：中国政府允将满洲及东部内蒙古各矿开采权，许与日本臣民。关于这项买卖，蒋美商约是规定得更为巧妙而广泛的：“…………关于缔约此方国民法人及团体在缔约彼方公有土地上经营行业之该缔约彼方之法人及团体中之股票所有权，根据本款之规定，缔约此方无须给予优于其国民法人及团体自缔约彼方所获得之权利及优利。”（第四条第一款）事实上，蒋介石早已将中国西北探测与采油权利出卖给美国环球公司了，戈壁沙漠已有二十五井在开采中。去年七月美国雷诺公司宣布，将经营山东台湾东北之铝矿。最近，蒋政府又将湖南所有与国防有关的特种金属——锑、锰等矿开采权，通通卖给了美帝国主义。二十一条第三号规定：将汉冶萍公司作为中日两国合办事业。而蒋介石却来得更为慷慨：“缔约此方之国民法人及团体，在缔约彼方全部领土内，应享有组织与参加该缔约彼方法人及团体之权利，以从事于商务制造加工科学教育宗教及慈善事业，”（第四条第二款）一个中日“合办”的汉冶萍公司与无数个各色各样的中美“合办”的法人团体（且不说美国独办的），相形之下，真是“小巫见大巫”呵。二十一条第四号是：中国政府允准所有中国沿海港湾及岛屿，概不让与或租借与他国。诚然，在公布的蒋美商约中还没有这样的明文规定，但我们知道，蒋美商约的谈判是完全秘密的，它仅仅是蒋美密约透露出来的一部分。据去年九月上海《新闻通讯》报导：美国剩余物资售华附有密约三十年船坞协定，依此协定，三十年内中国所有的海港，美国军舰皆可自由出入使用。（按：蒋美商约第二十二条第五款：倘缔约此方之船舶，由于气候恶劣或因任何其他危难，被迫避入缔约彼方对外国商务或航业不开放之任何口岸地方或领水时，此项船舶应获得友好之待遇及协助，以及必需与现有之供应品及修理器材。本款于军舰及渔船以及第二十一条第二款所规定之船舶，亦适用之。）事实上，上海、青岛、秦皇岛等地，乃至台湾的基隆、高雄，今天都已成为美帝国主义的基地了。关于中国沿海港湾岛屿，如果说袁世凯对日寇开了一张支票，那么，今天蒋介石对美帝国主义是已经兑现了。
    袁世凯所承认的所作的，蒋介石都已经承认了作了，毫无不及，而有过之；而当年袁世凯尚不敢承认尚不敢作的，蒋贼也竟悍然不顾一切地承认了作了！
    廿一条第五号除第六项（关于福建经济权益者）外，其余各项袁世凯是未敢承认的。第一项：中国政府须聘用日人为军事、财政、政治等项顾问。这一项，在蒋介石对美帝国主义是早已办到，岂仅聘用个别的顾问，而且是为数四五千人的“军事顾问团”呵。至于李度、萨凡奇等等，以及什么美国的将军博士之流，在蒋介石儿皇帝的朝廷里是不胜枚举的。第二项：所有在中国内地所设日本病院寺院学校等，概允其土地所有权。关于这项要求，蒋贼对美帝国主义亦已承认，而且有所补充。蒋美商约第八条第一款：“缔约此方之国民，法人及团体，在缔约彼方全部领土内，应许其取得，保有与处分地产及其他不动产。”第三项是：将必要地方之警察，作为中日合办，或在此等地方之警察官署，聘用日人改良中国警察机关。这项要求是非常毒辣的，然而，蒋介石对美帝国主义却早已办到。美蒋合办之“中美合工所”，很久以来就完全统治了国民党的警察和特务，所谓“中美特工训练班”，遍及各地——去年十一月，北平又成立了所谓“中美警宪联络室”，实行中美警宪联勤。最近，美国前巴克莱警局局长布尔摸，又被蒋介石请来“改革中国警政”。第四项是：由日本采办一定数量之军械。众所周知，美帝国主义所供给蒋贼进行内战的军械，是远远超过“一定数量”了。第五项是：允将接连武昌与九江南昌之铁路，及南昌杭州间，南昌潮州间，各铁路之建造权，许与日本。据去年十月十二日蒋记和平日报载称：粤汉路局刘副局长顷告本报记者：中美合筑粤汉路，美国愿贷美金五亿元，各种材料须在美国采购。借款将移用一部，作为架设黄河铁桥之用，所有各项工程计划，已经美国建筑工程公司承办。灼然可见，粤汉、平汉两路的“建造权”，已被蒋贼奉送给他的美国爸爸了。第七项是：允日本国人，在中国有宣教之权。这在蒋美商约中亦复是设想周详，备而不漏：“缔约此方之国民在缔约彼方全部领土内，应准许其行使信仰及礼拜之自由，并设立学校以教育其子女，并将在自己住宅或任何其他适当建筑物内，单独、集体或于宗教或教育法人及团体中，举行宗教仪式及传教或传授其他知识，不因宗教信仰或其他原因，而受任何妨害或侵扰。”（第十二条第一款）
    袁世凯之为大卖国贼，人民的历史家早有定论，在这里绝不是写翻案文章，为他解脱；而是意欲借诸一点史实的对照，使我们得以更深刻地认识蒋介石今天的卖国罪行是何等的空前无耻与丑恶！袁世凯阴谋帝制自为，为了取得日本帝国主义的援助以达此目的，竟不惜“卖国求荣”，置国脉民命于不顾，接受了日寇的二十一条；三十余年以后的今天，蒋介石为了坚持反人民的内战，为了维持四大家族的封建买办法西斯的独裁统治，继承“宁赠友邦，勿予家奴”的卖国衣钵，变本加厉的签订了集古今中外卖国条约之大成的蒋美商约。但我们知道，对待大独裁者卖国贼，为人民的意志与力量所推动的时代之轮是严正无情的，二十一条并没有挽救了袁世凯的垂死命运，结果还是一场“新华春梦”，身败名裂，前车可鉴，蒋介石应当用这面历史的镜子，照一照自己。
