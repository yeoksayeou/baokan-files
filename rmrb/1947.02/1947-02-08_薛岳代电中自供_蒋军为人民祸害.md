    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd. The following are several telegrams seized by the People's Liberation Army from Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, during a certain county town battle, which self-confess the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek army's rape and plunder. The December 4th telegram stated: "According to reports, along the Jinpu Railway line, troops (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek army) have 'borrowed' eight or nine out of ten pieces of furniture from the people. When relocating, not only do they not return them to the owners, but they take everything away, even dismantling and taking away doors and windows. Even when ordered to return to their original defense positions, they do not bring back the furniture they took away, and requisition from the village chiefs with urgency, showing anger at the slightest delay… When stationed in civilian houses, they expel all the owners… The troops in Huaishui and Suqian, once they enter, 'rape, loot, and ransack everything.' They are brutal to the people, forcing sales and purchases, and even raping women at night.” The October 14th telegram stated: "When searching and purchasing civilian goods, the transport troops use five trucks, resorting to any means to force 'purchases.'" Xue Yue's telegrams show that the Chiang Kai-shek army is a murderer harming the people. The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department's "reason" for refusing to restore the military positions of January 13th, saying "once retreated, there will be nothing to rely on," is a complete lie.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th. In the one hundred and one days that Zaozhuang was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army, more than 800 people were killed or injured, and more than 1,000 houses were burned down. In Xinzhen alone, 97 people were kicked and beaten by the Chiang Kai-shek army, and 138 people were shot or buried alive. In Sanhe Street in the city, seven mass graves of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers have been discovered in two locations, with a total of sixteen people buried alive. Some were killed by bayonets, including the bloody and mangled corpses of three young girls, clearly killed after being raped. Zhao Da Sao, who was nine months pregnant, and Liu Da Ma, who was over fifty years old, were also insulted. The destruction in the city was extremely severe, with the greatest losses in the three major streets of Beida Temple Center Victory. The democratic government is now actively carrying out relief efforts.

    薛岳代电中自供
    蒋军为人民祸害
    【新华社山东二日电】下面是某县城战役中人民解放军缴获徐州绥署主任薛岳的几份代电，自供了蒋军奸淫抢掠的暴行。十二月四日代电内称：“据报津浦沿线一带部队（指蒋军）将民间家俱“借去”十之八九，移防时不惟不归还业主，竟全数携带一空，并将门窗亦拆除带走，甚至奉命驻返原防时亦不将带走之家俱带回，复向乡保长征用，切急如星火，稍有迟缓即声色俱厉。……………驻扎民房时则将房主全体驱出。………淮宿部队一入“奸倒便搜劫一空，对民众则态度横暴，强卖强买，并当夜强奸妇女之事发生。”十月十四日代电内称：“搜购民物，辎重部队利用汽车五辆不择手段强迫‘购买’。”薛岳代电说明蒋军为祸害人民凶手，国民党中宣部为拒绝恢复一月十三日军事位置之“理由”有谓“如一经撤退即无所依托”是十足的谎话。
    【新华社山东五日电】在枣庄被蒋军侵占的一百零一天中，杀死杀伤群众八百余人，烧毁房屋千余间，仅新镇一处被蒋军踢打成伤者九十七人，枪杀活埋致死者一百三十八人，市内三合街已发现蒋军七人，坑两处，共十六棉花活埋者，有被刺刀所杀者，其中有三少女尸体血肉模糊，显系奸后杀死，镇内怀孕九月的赵大嫂及五十余岁的刘大妈亦遭侮辱，市内被毁甚剧烈，以北大庙中心胜利三大街损失最重。现民主政府正积极进行救济。
