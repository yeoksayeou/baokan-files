　　Wang Futing from Chishiqiao Village in Qinyuan is a liberated peasant. During the previous Lüliang campaign, in order to defend his liberation and defend Chairman Mao, on November 19th of last year, he and others voluntarily carried grenades from Han Hong to Fensi and Jixian. Passing through Wangzhuang in Huoxian, they discovered the enemy, who scattered the civilian laborers, leaving more than 300 people behind. Cadre He, who was in charge of the civilian laborers, was very worried because the front line urgently needed ammunition. Hearing that the enemy was about to launch a surprise attack, he called on the civilian laborers to transfer the ammunition. Wang Futing took the lead in volunteering, and the other civilian laborers followed Wang Futing to transfer the ammunition overnight. It wasn't until the third day that they requested civilian laborers from Lingshi to cooperate with the Qinyuan civilian laborers to transport the ammunition to Xicun in Fensi. Later, they had to send it to Qiaocun in Jixian, but some civilian laborers were hungry because their rations were finished, and they wanted to return. Wang Futing not only did not suggest returning, but he also wanted to follow the troops all the way and fought several battles with the troops. The first time was in Longyuan Village in Puxian. At night, he carried sixty grenades and followed the troops, sticking close until the battle ended at dawn. When returning, he and the soldiers of the Special Task Company carried a stretcher all the way to the stones under the shade. The second battle involved carrying things to the Xiguan Village area in ×× County, and when returning, he carried a bag of foreign noodles and a blanket on his back. The third time he participated in the Guanshan battle in Wucheng Town. The fourth time he participated in the southwest battle of Wucheng Town. By the fifth battle of Wucheng, all the civilian laborers from Qinyuan had left, leaving only him. He said to the comrades in the army, "Others have left, but I won't leave. Unless I die, and if I don't die, I must participate to the end." Once, while cleaning the battlefield, he saw the political workers carrying the wounded, so he carried them twice in a row, and together with everyone else, carried the wounded away. He lived with a certain unit for seven days, never idle. After the battle ended, he rested in the supply department. The cadres and soldiers in the army treated him very well, and everyone felt that his spirit of participating in the war was good, so before leaving, they gave him a donkey and other things.

　　由沁源随军到吕梁担架运输样样立功
    【本报太岳二十二日电】沁源赤石桥村王福廷是个翻身户，前次吕梁作战，他为保卫翻身保卫毛主席，曾在去年十一月十九日和大家自动从韩洪担上手榴弹送往汾西、吉县，路经霍县王庄发现敌人，把民夫冲散了，留下三百多人，带民夫的贺干事着了急，前方需用弹药很急，怕完不成任务，又听到敌人要来奔袭，便号召民夫转移弹药。王福廷首先自报奋勇，其他民夫也跟着王福廷一块儿把弹药连夜转移走，直到第三天，才从灵石要来民夫配合沁源民夫运到汾西的西村。后来又要往吉县的桥村送，有些民夫困为给养吃完了，提出来要往回返，王福廷不但没提回的意见，而且他还要跟上部队一路走，并与部队在一起打了几次仗；第一次在蒲县的龙苑村，晚上他担的六十个手榴弹和部队相跟上走，直到天明战斗结束时，他还是跟的紧紧地，回来的时候，又和特务连的战士抬上担架，一直抬到荫底下石头。第二次战斗，担上东西送到××县席关村一带，回来时扛了一袋洋面，背了一块毯子。第三次参加午城镇关西山战斗。第四次参加午城镇西南战斗。到第五次午城战斗时，沁源的民夫都走了，只留他一个人。他对部队同志说：“别人走了我不走，我除非死了，要死不了我就非参加到底不可。”一次打扫战场时，他看见政工人员都搬伤员，自己也就连背二次，和大家共同把伤员背走了。他和某部在一起住了七天，每天不闲。战斗结束了，他休息在供给部，部队上的干部战士待他都很好，大家都感到他这种参战的精神好，所以在临走时，送给他一头毛驴和其他东西。
