    American Policy Toward China Has Bankrupted
    For the past year, the United States has been interfering in China's internal affairs under the guise of "mediation," supporting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war, and should bear serious responsibility for the situation in China.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] TASS reports that Izvestia's diplomatic observer commented on the 1st: The United States' decision to withdraw from the Three-Person Committee summarizes a certain stage of American foreign policy toward China. The observer traced back, stating: In December 1945, the Moscow Conference resolved that the three countries would not interfere in China's internal affairs. At that time, the United States was forced to slightly modify its policy toward China, concealing its interference in China's internal affairs with the cloak of "mediation." However, this "mediation" immediately adopted an extremely one-sided approach, which was primarily manifested in providing increasing military, economic, and financial support for all measures taken by the Kuomintang to suppress democratic groups, consolidate its one-party dictatorship, and launch a civil war. The observer stated: Under these circumstances, the Three-Person Committee was by no means playing a mediating role, but merely concealing the United States' interference in China's internal affairs by standing on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries. With this support, the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in January 1946, refused to implement the establishment of a coalition government, and convened the "National Assembly" to pass a "constitution" in an attempt to legalize the rule of the reactionary group. Chinese public opinion has undergone tremendous changes in the past year; it has realized that the unification of China is only possible on a democratic basis. Therefore, the United States' policy toward China has gone bankrupt. However, in the future, the United States may interfere in China in new forms.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] Moscow News: One day after Izvestia criticized the United States for concealing its interference in China's internal affairs under the guise of "mediation" for the past year, Pravda commented on the 2nd: The United States should bear serious responsibility for the development of the domestic situation in China due to its policy toward China. The great assistance given by the United States armed forces to the Kuomintang army, as well as the continued delivery of American military supplies to the Kuomintang army, are the two major characteristics of the American policy and methods toward China. As a result of the United States' interference in China's internal affairs, the Kuomintang warlords continue to wage war against the people's democratic forces in vast areas of China, causing massive bloodshed, the destruction of countless towns, and the prevalence of famine and infectious diseases in war-torn areas. This is the result of the United States' "mediation" in China. The purpose of the United States' "mediation" in China is to ensure the victory of the Kuomintang reactionary forces. The United States' withdrawal of its representative from the Three-Person Committee is an admission of the failure of its policy toward China.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] Moscow News: Pravda declared on the 26th of last month that if the United States implements the foreign policy advocated by the most reactionary elements of the Republican Party (Senator Vandenberg and Foreign Policy Advisor Dulles), it will undermine the foundation of international cooperation. Pravda stated: The blueprint for foreign policy outlined by Vandenberg in his speech in Cleveland on January 21st is included in the imperialist expansion plan. Vandenberg's views on the China issue advocate that the United States adopt a more active and open policy of interference. The newspaper believes that Dulles' suggestion in his January 17th speech to link the economic blockade of Germany with neighboring countries such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands is an ugly plan of an American trap for the above-mentioned countries.

### 消息报真理报发表评论称  美对华政策已告破产

　　消息报真理报发表评论称
    美对华政策已告破产
    美国一年来以“调解”的外衣掩盖着干涉中国内政，支持蒋介石独裁内战，对中国局势应负严重责任。
    【新华社延安二日电】塔斯社讯，消息报外交观察家于一日评称：美国退出三人委员会之决定，总结了美国对华外交政策之某一阶段。观察家追溯称：一九四五年十二月，莫斯科会议曾决议三国不干涉中国内政，当时美国被迫稍微修改其对华政策，将对中国内政之干涉用“调解”的外衣遮盖起来。但是，此一“调解”立即采取了极端偏于一面的方针，此种方针首先表现在对于国民党武装镇压民主团体、巩固一党独裁及发动内战之一切措施给日益增加的军事经济及财政的支持上。观察家称：在此种情况下，三人委员会绝不是起着调解作用，而仅是起着掩蔽美国站在国民党反动派方面干涉中国内政的作用。国民党反动派得到此种支持，遂撕毁一九四六年正月的停战令与政协决议，拒绝执行成立联合政府，并召开了“国大”，通过“宪法”，图使反动集团的统治合法化。中国的社会舆论，在过去一年中发生极大的变化；它认识到中国的统一，只有在民主的基础上才有可能。因此，美国的对华政策遂告破产。但今后美国将可能再以新的形式干涉中国。
    【新华社延安三日电】莫斯科讯：在消息报批评一年来以“调解”的外衣掩盖其干涉中国内政之后一天，真理报于二日评称：美国由于其对华政策，对于中国国内局势的发展应担负严重责任。美国武装部队给予国民党军以极大援助，以及美国军用物资之继续运交国民党军，是美国对华政策、方法的两大特点。由于美国干涉中国内政的结果，国民党军阀在中国广大区域内继续对人民民主力量进行战争，大量的流血，无数城镇惨遭焚毁，以及战争荼毒区域内饥荒和传染病的流行，这就是美国在中国“调处”的结果。美国在中国的“调处”，其目的是在保证国民党反动势力的胜利。美国在撤回其参加三人委员会的代表时，就是承认美国对华政策的失败。
    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科讯：真理报于上月二十六日宣称：美国若实行共和党里最反动的分子（参议员范登堡与外交顾问杜勒斯）所主张的外交政策，则将破坏国际合作之基础。真理报称：范登堡一月二十一日在克利夫兰演说中所概述的外交政策的蓝本，是包括于帝国主义扩张计划中的。范登堡对中国问题所发表的意见，系主张美国采取更积极更公开的干涉政策。该报认为：杜勒斯在一月十七日的演说中，将德国经济封锁诸如法、比、荷等邻邦结连起来的建议是一个美国圈套上述各国的丑恶计划。
