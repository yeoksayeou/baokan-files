Learning from Ehrenburg
Reading "Ink and Blood"
Wu Xiang

Ehrenburg's works need no further praise, but I would like to boldly write about the enlightenment "Ink and Blood" has given me in writing, although I may not be able to avoid errors and superficiality.

At a time when US-Soviet relations were quite tense, Stalin announced to the world: "I do not believe in the actual danger of a so-called 'new war'!" "Ink and Blood" is a powerful footnote to this statement. With unparalleled insight, Ehrenburg tore through the fog-like curtain created by slander, exposing how American military, political, and intelligence workers, as well as journalists who advocated for the big bourgeoisie, were sinfully deceiving the masses. He pointed out: "Those who create disputes openly say they do not love the Soviet Union, but I dare to add that they do not love the United States either. All they think about is world domination, the atomic bomb, the Anglo-American bloc, etc., and they have forgotten one thing—the descendants of Americans!" Here, Ehrenburg not only directly served the needs of current politics, but he also clearly distinguished between American swindlers and the American people, giving hatred and sympathy respectively, so that the vast peace-loving people of the United States could not help but become as angry as he was, shouting loudly to stop the schemers' endless slander: "Enough! I will not pay for your ink with my blood!" However, Ehrenburg used the method of a mature artist, he did not force the reader to accept any conclusions, he only wrote undeniable facts. And in these factual narratives, there is a sincere love, a love not only for the Soviet motherland, but also for all the good things in America. Therefore, what he hates also makes people feel that it should be hated. Honest emotion can win the trust of readers, especially those who originally have prejudices and misunderstandings.

Many examples can be given to illustrate that we are not good at replacing empty slogans with facts, and we often fail to make the meaning clear when narrating facts, let alone expressing enthusiasm. This is unavoidable for beginners, but we must not forgive ourselves for it.

Facts are of course more persuasive than empty slogans, but it must be added: not all randomly collected facts have great persuasiveness. For greater persuasiveness, we should study hard, not only to sharpen the pen, but more importantly, to sharpen the mind, train the senses to be sharper, and go to the sea of reality to observe, experience, capture, excavate, and select. After Ehrenburg refuted the American journalist's false claim that "Soviet tanks invaded Tehran," he wrote: "Tehran is very far from here, and now I am personally in the United States. However, news came that while I was traveling across the United States, I was always accompanied by a 'Soviet secret police officer,' but in fact, I was accompanied by a representative of the US State Department..." What a crisp and loud slap in the face he gave to all the rumor-mongering experts! Because what he cited was his own personal fact that no one could doubt.

Any moving fact will appear weak and powerless when isolated, so it is necessary to indicate the position of the fact, and it is necessary to organize the facts. This can also determine the success or failure of a work. Ehrenburg wrote: "If the Americans want to use Iceland as a base, it is for 'the security of the world.' If the Soviet Union does not want its neighbors to be used as bases for aggression against the Soviet Union, it becomes 'red imperialism.' If the United States manufactures atomic bombs, it is the mysterious work of scientists, or just harmless entertainment like football. If Red Army personnel line up and walk on the streets of Moscow to take a steam bath, it is preparation for the Third World War." This is the so-called "contrast" method that we are generally familiar with. This contrast method often strongly implies the author's concept and is one of the best methods of organizing facts.

There are many clever contrasts in "Ink and Blood." What is used to contrast the tense US-Soviet relations that were stirred up by the schemers' clamor is the intimate shouting of the soldiers of the United States and the Soviet Union when they met on the Elbe River not long ago: "We are friends!" This sentence will surely awaken the American people's memory of Soviet-American friendship, because on the day of jointly opposing German fascism, this sentence undoubtedly brought tears of joy to the eyes of Americans who eagerly hoped for victory.

American journalists who tried to get "sensational" news in order to make waves complained that they could not see anything in the Soviet Union, but Ehrenburg cited many facts that moved the Soviets themselves: "Factories producing Petlyakov bombers are manufacturing cars, factories producing tanks are manufacturing milk cans..." etc. This is also an extremely strong and thought-provoking contrast. Yes, here he used words such as "excitement," "moved," and "proud," but isn't the Soviet people's excitement, being moved, and being proud because they can work hard for peaceful construction a proof that the Soviet Union can coexist peacefully with any country?

The lessons "Ink and Blood" gives us should be more. Let us all read the full text carefully two more times!

(Editor's note: "Ink and Blood" was published in this newspaper from October 15th to 18th last year. Ehrenburg's writing style is currently worthy of study and learning by our war correspondents and authors. This article is considered an introduction. We hope to have more Ehrenburg-style short articles to portray our great patriotic self-defense war.)

    向爱伦堡学习
    读“墨水与鲜血”
    吴象
    爱伦堡的作品是无须再加添什么赞词的，但是我想大胆写一点“墨水与鲜血”在写作上给予我的启示，虽然我也许不能自免于错误与浅薄。
    美苏关系相当紧张之际，斯大林向世界宣布说：“我不相信所谓‘新战争’的实际危险性！”“墨水与鲜血”正是这句话有力的注脚。爱伦堡以深湛无比的洞察力，撕开了诽谤所造成的浓雾似的幕，揭露美国那些军事政治情报工作者，以及为大资产阶级鼓吹的新闻记者，如何在罪恶地愚弄着群众。他指出：“那些制造纠纷的人，公开的说他们不爱好苏联，但我敢大胆补充一句，他们也并不爱好美国，他们想到的只是世界统治权、原子弹、英美集团等，只差一样没想到——美国的子孙！”在这里，爱伦堡不仅直接服务于当前的政治的要求，而且他明确地区分了美国骗子与美国人民，分别给以憎恶与同情，使美国广大爱好和平的人民，都不禁和他同样的愤激起来，大声喝住阴谋家们无穷尽的诽谤：“够了！我不为你的墨水付出我的鲜血！”然而爱伦堡使用的是一个成熟的艺术家的方法，他没有强迫读者接受什么结论，他只写了无可争辩的事实。而且在这些事实叙述中蕴藏着真挚的热爱，这种热爱不仅是对于苏维埃祖国的，也是对于美国一切良好事物的。因而，他所憎恶的也就使人觉得是应该憎恶的。正直的感情能赢得读者的信任，特别是对原来有成见有误解的读者。
    可以举出很多例子，说明我们既不善于以事实代替空喊，又常常在叙述事实时使人无法看出其中的含义，更不用说表现热情了，这在初学是难免的，但我们决不能因此而原谅自己。
    事实当然比空喊说服力大，但是必须补充：并不是一般的随意掇拾的事实都有很大说服力，为了说服力更大，就应该艰苦地学习，不只要把笔磨得更尖，重要的是要把思想磨炼得更明亮，感觉训练得更锐敏，到现实的大海中去观察、体验、捕捉、掘发、选择。爱伦堡在驳斥美国记者妄言“苏联坦克侵入德黑兰”消息后，写道：“德黑兰离此很远，现在我已亲身在美国了，可是，消息传来，说我在旅行全美时，始终由一个‘苏联秘密警察’陪伴着，但事实上，是由一个美国国务院的代表在陪伴着…………”他给了所有的造谣专家们一个何等清脆响亮的耳光呵！因为他所举的是自己亲身的谁也无法怀疑的事实。
    任何动人的事实在孤立的时候都会显得单薄无力，因此必须指明事实所处的地位，必须把事实组织起来。这同样是可以决定一篇作品的成败的。爱伦堡写道：“如果美国人要把冰岛作基地，那便是为了‘世界安全的保障’，如果苏联不欲他的邻邦用作侵略苏联的基地，那就成了‘赤色帝国主义’；如果美国制造原子弹，那便是科学家奥妙的工作，或只是足球似的无害的娱乐，如果红军人员排成行列走在莫斯科街上去洗蒸气浴，那便是准备作三次世界大战了。”这是我们一般人都熟知的所谓“对比”法，这种对比法常常强烈地暗示出作者的观念，是组织事实最好的方法之一。
    “墨水与鲜血”中有许多巧妙的对比。用来和当时被阴谋家的叫嚣弄得紧张起来的美苏关系作对比的，是不久以前美苏两国的士兵在易北河相遇时亲密的喊叫：“我们是朋友！”这句话一定能唤起美国人民对苏友好的回忆，因为在共同反对德国法西斯的当日，这句话无疑曾使迫切企望胜利的美国人流出喜悦的眼泪。
    企图得到“耸人听闻”的消息，以便兴风作浪的美国记者抱怨在苏联看不到什么东西，但是爱伦堡却举出了许多苏联人自己感动的事实：“出产彼得列雅可夫式轰炸机的工厂在制造汽车，出产坦克的工厂在制造牛奶罐……”等等，这也是极强烈的使人深思的对比。不错，在这里他用了“兴奋”“感动”“骄傲”等字眼，但是，苏联人民因为自己能努力于和平建设而兴奋、感动、骄傲，不正是一种证明苏联与任何国家都能和平共处的事实吗？
    “墨水与鲜血”给我们的教益应该是更多的，让我们都仔细的把全文再读两遍吧！        
    （编者按：“墨水与鲜血”发表于去年十月十五日至十八日本报。爱伦堡的写法，目前极值得我们战地记者和作者们研究学习，本篇算作一个引子，我们希望有更多爱伦堡式的短文来刻画出我们伟大的爱国自卫战争。）
