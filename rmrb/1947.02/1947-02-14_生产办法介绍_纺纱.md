    Production Method Introduction
    Spinning
    For our organizations and individuals engaging in production, spinning is a good option. This production doesn't require a lot of capital. It's best if you can borrow a spinning wheel; if you can't, you can buy one. The current market price is around two thousand yuan. In addition, there are cotton flowers; the current market price for clean cotton is three hundred and thirty yuan per jin. According to experienced comrades, beginners can produce yarn in just a few days if they are careful and patient. As for uniformity, that depends on your diligence in spinning. Generally, amateur spinners (with two hours of production time) can spin 1.5 to 2 liang per day, which is 1.5 to 2 jin of yarn per month. At the current price of 1,200 to 1,500 yuan per jin of yarn, you can sell the yarn for 2,500 to 3,000 yuan per month. After deducting the cost of the cotton, you can earn a net profit of 1,500 to 2,500 yuan per month. If you think this is worthwhile, then please get started. (Mu)

    生产办法介绍
    纺纱
    我们搞机关个人生产，纺纱是个好门路，这个生产，不要大本钱，能借到纺车更好，借不到可买一架，目前市价为两千元的样子。另外就是花，净花目前每斤市价为三百三十元。初学纺的，据有经验的同志谈，只要你细心耐心，有三几天就可抽出纱，至于匀净、就靠你勤纺了。一般业余纺手（有两小时生产时间的）每天可纺一两五钱到二两，一个月就可纺到一斤半到两斤纱，以目前每斤纱卖一千二百元至一千五百元计，一月可卖纱二千五百元到三千元，余去花本，每月可净赚一千五百元至二千五百元。你如觉得这个合算，那么就请动手搞起来。（木）
