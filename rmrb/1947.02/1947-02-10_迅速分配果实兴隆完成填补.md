    【This newspaper, Weixian, 7th】Timely grasping and distributing the fruits of struggle, Xinglong Town in Qiu County has completed land reform. During the rent reduction movement in Xinglong Town, a total of 126 mu of land, 18 houses, three sets of millstones, one cart, and 2,496 jin of grain were recovered. The leadership urged village cadres and activists to quickly and reasonably distribute the fruits to the masses. The distribution method for land was to start from the lowest level (those with little or no land), regardless of gender or participation in the struggle, and successively supplement them up to the standard amount of land. The principle for housing was to maintain existing residences, and those without houses were supplemented with a plot of land for building. The method for distributing movable property was to price all materials, and then distribute them based on individuals and class status. The whole village was divided into five levels, with each class receiving the following scores: desperately poor 10 points, poor peasants 6 points, lower-middle peasants 4 points, middle peasants 2 points, and upper-middle peasants 1 point. Each point was worth 340 yuan, and military dependents were raised one level. When distributing items that had already been priced, each person could only take what they were allocated and could not exceed that amount. The first level had priority, and military dependents had priority.
