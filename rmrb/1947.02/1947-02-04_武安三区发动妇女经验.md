　　Experiences in Mobilizing Women in the Third District of Wu'an
[This Dispatch from Wu'an] The Third District has recently gained several experiences in mobilizing women: First, inspiring poor women to speak out about their suffering is the key to mobilization. Poor women are our main target for mobilization. In addition to suffering the same poverty and oppression as men, they also suffer an additional layer of oppression from feudal ethics and morality, and their suffering is very deep. Therefore, the first step is to organize them to speak out about their suffering, which hits them where it hurts. From their personal suffering, we can guide them to class comparison. For example, the women in Village X said that the landlord's women go out by car and return on horseback, while we grind the millstone. The landlord's women wear silk and satin, while we wear rags. Their enjoyment is all the blood and sweat of us poor people. This comparison aroused hatred, which resulted in active action for struggle. When women have the desire to struggle, the leadership should let them do it and believe in the power of women's actions. Don't think that women are useless. In Xizhou Village, more than 30 poor women were gathered to speak out about their suffering. Among them were those who had been maids and those who had cooked for the landlords. When one woman recounted that she broke a bowl of the landlord's when she was a maid and had to kneel for half the night; and another woman recounted the tragic experience of living in the landlord's house, but the landlord insisted on redeeming the house, and her mother hanged herself because she had nowhere to live, more than 30 people cried. That night, these women struggled against a landlord's family. Second, organize male cadres and male members to discuss women's issues, understand women's suffering, and examine their own ideological views of belittling women. Many village cadres examined their old ideas of looking down on women and not caring about women in the past, and many people were determined to mobilize their wives, and in the future, they would change their old mindset of fearing women going out, let them come out to turn over and open their minds, and they were determined to support women and make decisions for them. Third, in the process of mobilizing women, pay attention to resolving their family conflicts, and persuade their parents-in-law and husbands from the struggle against feudal landlords to let young women come out to participate in meetings and turn over. Educate women to recognize the peasant association and participate in the peasant association from the solution of specific problems. Some places do not pay attention to enlightening women's thinking and awareness, do not pay attention to solving women's specific problems, and simply put their names on the roster and absorb them into the peasant association. Even if they are class women, they will not play a role. Fourth, women are very enthusiastic when they are first mobilized, and they are willing to compete with men. For example, women in Yehe and other villages are willing to struggle independently and ask to learn how to make stone grenades. The leadership should pay attention to the precious enthusiasm of women and appropriately organize men and women to compete to improve their combativeness. Fifth, when women first participate in the struggle, or the struggle is initially successful, pay attention to giving them some fruits, and their enthusiasm will be even higher. Sixth, in the process of mobilizing women, individually educate women who are not upright and change the simple method of attacking and struggling. For example, everyone discussed the reasons why a "slut" in Village X was a "slut." It was because she had financial difficulties, and she was fooled when someone bought her something. If she had turned over earlier, she would not have gone astray. These people should be persuaded and educated to admit their mistakes and change.
As a result of mobilizing women, the feudal tails were cleared more thoroughly, and at the same time, women's awareness and organization were greatly improved. They come to meetings quickly and work actively. Because women participate in the struggle and show their strength, village cadres and men generally respect women more, and women's family and social status have gradually improved.

　　武安三区发动妇女经验
    【本报武安讯】三区最近在发动妇女上取得几点经验：一、启发贫苦妇女诉苦，是发动的关键。贫苦妇女是我们发动的主要对象，他们除和男人受同样的贫苦压迫外，还多一层封建礼教压迫，痛苦是很深的。因此首先组织诉苦即打在疼处，由切身苦处，引导到阶级对比，如×村妇女说地主妇女车上来马上去，咱碾道来，磨道去；地主妇女穿绸挂缎，咱是破衣烂衫，他们享福尽是咱穷人的血汗。由对比引起仇恨，结果即积极行动起来斗争。在妇女有了斗争要求时，领导上应放手让她们去干，相信妇女的行动力量，不要以为妇女不顶事。西周庄召集三十多个贫苦妇女诉苦，其中有使女出身的，有给地主家做过饭的，当一个妇女诉到当使女时打了地主一个碗跪了半夜；又一个说到当地主的房子住，人家硬要赎房，她娘没处住上吊死了的悲惨经过时，三十多个人都哭了，当晚这伙妇女就斗了一家地主。二、组织男干部男会员讨论妇女问题，了解妇女痛苦，检查自己思想上轻视妇女的观点，不少村干部检查出过去瞧不起妇女不关心妇女的旧思想，许多人决心去发动自己老婆，今后要转变怕妇女出门的旧脑筋，让她们也出来闹翻身开脑筋，并决心给妇女撑腰作主。三、发动妇女过程中注意解决其家庭矛盾，从对封建地主的斗争中说通其公婆丈夫思想，使他们愿让青年妇女出来参加开会闹翻身。从具体问题的解决中，教育妇女认识农会参加农会。有些地方不注意启发妇女思想觉悟，不注意解决妇女具体问题，只简单上名册吸收入农会，虽是阶级妇女也不起作用。四、妇女刚发动起热情极高，愿意和男人比赛，如野河等村妇女愿意单独斗争，要求学打石雷，领导上应注意宝贵妇女这种热情，适当组织男女比赛，提高其斗争性。五、妇女一开始参加斗争，或斗争初次胜利，注意分给她们些果实，则热情更高。六、在发动妇女过程中，对不正派的妇女个体教育，改变单纯打击斗争方法。如×村一个“破鞋”，大家讨论她当“破鞋”的原因，是生活有困难，人家买点东西送给她就上了当，如早翻身不致去走邪道，对这些人应劝说教育使她认错改过。
    由于发动了妇女，封建尾巴清查得更彻底，同时妇女的觉悟和组织性也大提高。开会来的很快，工作也积极了。由于妇女参加斗争，显示了力量，村干部和男人们一般对妇女也较尊重了，妇女的家庭社会地位已逐渐提高。
