    The Political Department of the Military Region Launches a Production and Thrift Campaign
    Comrade Yang Mingshan Saves His Full Year's Clothing Allowance
    Production and Thrift Welcome a Bright Future
    [Our Dispatch] All comrades of the Political Department of the Military Region actively responded to Comrade Bo Yibo's call for "mass production and thrift to fully support the front line," and launched in-depth discussions in branches and groups. They fully support the decision to reduce the issuance of summer clothes, shoes, and the cancellation of subsidies this year, and unanimously recognize that sharing weal and woe with the soldiers in the great patriotic self-defense war is the supreme glory of every comrade. Comrade Yang Mingshan, the general affairs section administrator, came from the 5th Division Corps last year and has no savings. He also resolutely proposed at the group meeting: saving the full year's allowance of millet, one and a half sets of single-layer clothing, five pairs of shoes, and three towels. (Liu Ying)

    军区政治部全体同志展开生产节约运动
    杨明山同志节约全年应领衣物
    生产节约迎接光明
    【本报讯】军区政治部全体同志积极响应薄一波同志“大量生产节约，全力支援前线”的号召，在支部及小组展开深入讨论。对本年决定减发夏衣、鞋子以及取消补助金，都十分拥护，一致认识在伟大的爱国自卫战争中，与战士共甘苦，是每个同志的无上光荣。总务科管理员杨明山同志，去年从五师兵团过来，毫无积蓄，亦在小组会上毅然提出：节约全年津贴小米，一套半单衣，鞋子五双，毛巾三条。（柳英）
