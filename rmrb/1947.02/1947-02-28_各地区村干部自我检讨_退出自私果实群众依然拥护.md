Village Cadres in Various Regions Conduct Self-Criticism: People Still Support Them After Returning Ill-Gotten Gains

[Report from this newspaper in Jinan on the 26th] In order to implement land reform and adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, many district and village cadres have returned the cheaply bought and excessively distributed fruits of victory. Comrade Liu Hongling from the Third District of Jing County bought a large cart from the masses for 20,000 yuan last year, sold it for 31,000 yuan, privately took a bicycle, and cheaply bought a fur coat in the sub-district. Due to his influence, twelve sub-district cadres and some village cadres also cheaply bought some fruits of victory. Therefore, the masses reflected: "We have turned over, the cadres have turned over, and the cadres have gotten rich!" A few days ago, the county held a county-wide cadre meeting to review the distribution of fruits of victory and the relationship with the masses. Comrade Liu made a painful self-criticism and humbly admitted his mistakes. He firmly said: "I will definitely return the things, and even return the 12,000 yuan I earned." He also stated that he would not only return them himself, but also mobilize sub-district and village cadres to return the cheaply bought and excessively distributed fruits of victory. The village cadre of Qianxiancheng Village in the First District of Yuanchao held a self-criticism and mutual criticism meeting on the evening of February 5th. Village head Liu Weijun reflected that he had embezzled a small leather jacket and four mu of land during the rent reduction and repayment process and had a bad attitude towards the masses. He felt sorry for the masses and resolutely returned the items to the masses, admitting his mistakes in front of them. At the democratic conference of Gexinzhuang Village in Guan County, the village chief said: "The fruits of victory from last year have not yet been distributed to everyone, which is my mistake." Before he could finish speaking, former village cadre Ge Jinjiang said: "I have 2,300 yuan of old fruits of victory from three years ago that haven't been distributed. I'm really sorry. Prices were not as high as they are now, but I have to return the money to make things right with everyone." In Beijie, Guangzong City, after education from district cadres, the village cadres deeply felt that it was wrong to embezzle fruits of victory and conducted a confession at the farmers' association members' meeting on the evening of February 10th. After the village cadres confessed, the masses not only did not harbor prejudices, but also proposed that as long as the fruits of victory were returned, they would still support them.

　　各地区村干部自我检讨
    退出自私果实群众依然拥护
    【本报冀南廿六日电】为贯彻土地改革，调整干群关系，许多区村干部纷纷退回贱买与多分果实。景县三区刘洪领同志去年用二万元贱买了群众斗出的一辆大车，卖了三万一千元，私要了一辆自行车，在小区贱买了一件皮袄。由于他的影响，十二个小区干部及一部分村干也贱买了些果实。因此群众反映：“翻身翻身，干部翻身，干部发财了！”日前该县召开全县干部会，检讨果实分配与群众关系时，刘同志作了沉痛检讨，虚心承认错误、他坚决的说：“回去一定把东西退出，连赚的一万二千元也退回去。”并表示不但自己退，还要动员小区及村干退出贱买和多分的果实。元朝一区前现城村干于二月五日晚召开自我检讨与互相批评会。庄长刘维军反省出在查减中贪污一个小皮袄、四亩地，对群众态度不好。他感觉对不起群众，要坚决退给群众，并在群众面前承认错误。冠县葛辛庄民主大会上，村长说：“去年的果实还没分给大家，是我的错误。”没等说完，旧村干葛金江说：“我手里有三年前的旧果实二千三百元没分，真不对，那时物价没有现在高，我反正得退出钱来才算对起大家。”广宗城内北街，村干经过区干教育，深刻感到贪污果实不对，于二月十日晚在农会会员大会上进行坦白。村干们坦白后，群众不但不存成见，并且提出；只要把果实退出来仍然拥护。
