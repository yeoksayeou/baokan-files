　　[This report from Taiyue on the 22nd] In the Ji-Meng border region, the land reform movement emphasizes first mobilizing the masses ideologically; therefore, the movement is rapid and large-scale. At the beginning of mentioning land distribution in the border region, the masses were mostly hesitant and dared not ask for land. Some feared a "change of regime," some feared "retribution," and some feared being implicated as spies. Therefore, it was first necessary to break through these thoughts and concerns. General propaganda about current affairs and the policy of "land to the tiller" was not enough; it was necessary to use practical examples to conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological education. In Nanguanzhuang, Nanyun, and other villages, more than 30 militiamen and cadres followed the county headquarters in campaigns, recognizing the situation and their own strength. When the villages began to encourage the masses to ask for land, they said without hesitation, "If there's pork and white flour, are you afraid no one will eat it?" Under their influence, 119 people signed up to ask for land, and the masses said, "If the cadres dare to ask, we dare to ask too." Rui Village first organized a meeting of three types of people who wanted land but didn't dare to ask for it: first, those who had been "retributed" against; second, those who had participated in several struggles but had not obtained land; and third, militiamen and cadres. These three types of people had two ideological obstacles: fear of asking for land and fear of "retribution." Those who feared "retribution" said, "We struggled all spring and only got an ox, but it was taken away by retribution. How dare we ask for land?" Those who had not obtained any fruit after several struggles said, "Riding a tiger, not afraid of being bitten." The leadership immediately seized on the latter, encouraging them. As a result, 24 people asked for land on the spot, but they were not resolute. Then, to strengthen the determination of those who wanted land, a "Do we really want it?" meeting was held, allowing everyone to talk about their concerns. Some said, "If we want it, we want it. Once a basin of water is spilled on the ground, it can't be taken back." Others said ambiguously, "Wanting it or not wanting it is fine." After a heated debate, they unanimously agreed to ask for land. In Xihu and other villages, although the masses said they wanted land, no one dared to be the first to ask for it when asked from whom. Behind the scenes, some were brewing the facts of how the landlord Feng Jianqing had oppressed and exploited people in the past. The Second District Chief heard this and immediately supported and encouraged the masses: "The land originally belonged to us. We must take it back—Feng Jianqing is a die-hard spy, and the government has ordered his arrest. Everyone, be bold and do it!" As soon as the masses heard that the government was supporting them, they complained to Feng Jianqing and asked for land.

　　济孟边沿区进行土地改革中
    首先打破思想顾虑
    “骑虎不怕虎咬”群众纷纷要地
    【本报太岳二十二日电】济孟边沿区土地改革运动中，重视首先从思想上发动群众；因此运动迅速，规模巨大。边沿区开始提起分土地，群众多是幌幌不定，不敢要地，有的怕“变天”，有的怕“倒算”，有的怕牵线（特务），因此首先要打破这些思想、顾虑。一般的宣传时事与耕者有其田政策是不够的，必须用实际例子进行深入细致的思想教育。南官庄、南云等村，有三十多个民兵与干部跟着县指挥部东征西奔的活动，认清了局势与自己的力量，该村开始启发群众要地时，他们便毫不犹豫的说：“有猪肉白面还怕没有人吃？”在他们的影响下，即有一百一十九人报名要地，群众说：“干部敢要咱也敢要。”瑞村首先组织想要地而又不敢要的三种人开会：第一种是被“倒算”户；第二种是曾经参加几次斗争而未得土地户；第三种是民兵与干部。这三种人有两种思想障碍，怕要地怕“倒算”户说：“斗了一春天得到一条牛还被倒算去了，还敢要地？”经过几次斗争，皆未得到果实的人却说：“骑虎不怕咬。”领导随即抓住后者给予鼓励，结果当场即有二十四人要地，但并不坚决。接着再坚定要地人的思想，召开“究竟要不要”会议，让大家漫谈心事，有的说：“要就要，一盆水泼倒地上已经收不回来了”，还有人模棱两可的说：“要不要都可以。”经大家热烈的争辩后，一致要地了。西胡等村群众，口里虽说要地，但一提出向谁要，便没有人敢开头一炮，背地里有人在酝酿地主冯建清过去如何压迫剥削人的事实，被二区区长听见，立即给群众撑腰壮胆：“土地本来就是咱们的，要收回来—冯建清是个死心塌地特务，政府已经下令捉拿。大家大胆的干吧！”群众一听政府给作主，便纷纷同冯建清诉苦要地。
