    Hao Pengju Cuts Himself Off From The People
    Lin Yi residents say: The Liberated Areas adopt a completely free and generous attitude towards any army participating in the democratic cause, welcoming those who come and seeing off those who leave; Hao Pengju's fickle and treacherous conspiracy is self-destructive and leads to his own demise!

    [Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 2nd] Former Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Democratic Allied Army, Hao Pengju, betrayed the people and defected, taking office on the 27th of last month as Commander-in-Chief of Chiang Kai-shek's 42nd Army Group and so-called "Commander of the Lu Nan Pacification Zone." The reaction among people here is extremely indifferent, because the people in the Liberated Areas adopt a completely free and generous policy towards any army participating in the democratic cause, welcoming those who come and seeing off those who leave, without any coercion whatsoever. However, Hao's fickle and treacherous conspiracy, his actions of utter faithlessness to the people and to the democratic and patriotic officers and soldiers under his command, apart from cutting himself off from the people and his own officers and soldiers, have no significant impact on the people's liberation cause in the Shandong Liberated Area and our current patriotic self-defense war. Hao himself and his officers and soldiers, under the broad love, care, and education of the people in the Liberated Area for the past year, originally had a very bright future in the cause of the Chinese people's democratic liberation. Now he has destroyed this future himself and thrown himself into the path of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war, which he himself condemned in his "First Anniversary of the Righteous Uprising of the Central China Democratic Allied Army" just two weeks ago. This is truly self-destruction. As for the usual set of slanders and abuse against the CCP and the military and civilians of the Liberated Area and reactionary "declarations" after the defection, such shameful actions are not worth the notice or refutation of informed people.

    郝鹏举自绝于人民
    临沂人士表示：解放区对任何军队参加民主事业，全抱自由宽大态度，来者欢迎，去者欢送；郝鹏举这种翻云覆雨阴谋，乃是自毁前途，自取灭亡！                
    【新华社临沂二日电】前华中民主联军总司令郝鹏举率部叛变背离人民，于上月二十七日就任蒋介石四十二集团军总司令及所谓“鲁南绥靖区司令官”，在此间人士中所引起的反应极为淡薄，因解放区人士对任何军队参加民主事业全抱自由和宽大政策，即来者欢迎，去者欢送，绝不加任何勉强。但郝氏这种翻云覆雨阴谋，对人民和对其部下民主爱国官兵毫无信义的举动，除自绝于人民和自绝其部下官兵外，对山东解放区人民解放事业及我们目前正在进行的爱国自卫战争，并无任何值得重视的影响。郝本人及其官兵，一年来在解放区人民宽大之爱护教育下，在中国人民民主解放事业上，原有极光明的前途，现在他自己又毁灭了这个前途，而投入他自己仅仅两星期以前发表的“华中民主联军一九举义周年感言”中所唾弃的蒋介石卖国独裁内战的道路，实自取灭亡。至于叛变后，照例要来一套对中共对解放区军民的污蔑漫骂和反动的“宣言”等，这种可耻行动则其不值识者一笑和一驳了。
