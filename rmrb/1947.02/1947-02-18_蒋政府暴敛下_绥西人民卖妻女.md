Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th—According to a report in the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 8th, the burden on the people of Sui West is as follows: In Dongsheng County, west of the river, the total grain produced last year was only over 10,000 shi, but over 13,000 shi were extorted as public grain, and even the remaining seeds were taken away. In Minyi Township, Guyang County, when resident Bai Yimin was unable to pay the grain, the grain collectors even held his two-year-old daughter upside down by her legs to demonstrate their power. In Tianzhen, some people sold their wives and daughters because they had no money to pay the public grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th—The Chiang government's collection of field tax in Jilin is more than double what it was under the puppet Manchukuo regime. According to official materials quoted by the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on the 15th of last month: those who paid one yuan during the puppet Manchukuo period must now pay one hundred and fifty yuan. The highest tax rate during the puppet Manchukuo period was no more than six yuan per qing, while the actual collection at present, such as in Yongji, exceeds two thousand yuan per qing.

　　蒋政府暴敛下
    绥西人民卖妻女
    【新华社延安十五日电】据八日津大公报报导，绥西人民负担情形称：河西东胜县，去年所产全部粮食仅一万余石，被勒索公粮竟达一万三千余石，存留之种籽也被追尽。固阳县民义乡居民白义敏因无力纳粮，征粮人员竟倒提其两岁幼女之双腿，以示淫威。天镇因无钱缴公粮，有出卖妻女者。
    【新华社延安十五日电】蒋政府在吉林征收田赋，竟高出伪满时一倍以上。据上月十五日沪文汇报引官方发表材料：伪满时期缴纳一元者，今须缴一百五十元，伪满最高税额每垧不过六元，而目前实际征收者如永吉被征每垧竟超出两千元。
