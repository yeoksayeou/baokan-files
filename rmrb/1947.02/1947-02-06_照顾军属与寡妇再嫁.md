I am a district office cadre (working as a secretary). I am currently facing a problem that I cannot understand and cannot resolve. The problem is this: There is a woman, 42 years old, who is a military dependent. Since her son joined the army last July, she has been living alone. After the land reform movement, she now owns more than ten acres of land. A widower from another village, also in his forties, lives in the same village. He has six or seven acres of land and also lives alone. Because he continuously helped her with farm work last year, the two of them "got into a relationship." However, recently, the village cadres, thinking that the woman was a military dependent and fearing that the soldiers at the front would be unhappy about this, arrested them and sent the man to the district. At that time, the woman came to the district, saying that she did not have enough manpower at home and requested to marry the widower. I did not have a proper solution to this problem at the time. I hope you can answer it in your column.

Comrade Liu Qifu:
According to the situation you described in your letter, we believe that as long as both the woman and the widower are sincere and willing, they can be allowed to marry. Of course, considering that the woman is a military dependent is necessary, but this woman is a widow, not the wife of a soldier. Government decrees encourage widow remarriage. Moreover, both the woman and the widower are single, and the woman's family has land but no one to cultivate it. Finding such a widower is a good match. If the two get married, this military dependent's family can be well established. We think that the village cadres acted that way possibly due to two thoughts: one is the feudal ideology left over from the old society, which believes that widows should remain chaste until old age. This old ideology should be broken. The other is that they think the widower is an "outsider" and have sectarian ideas that discriminate against him, which is also not good. We should unite and help people from other villages, especially these widowed and lonely people. The government should pay special attention to them and try to help them establish a family and career. Please investigate and, if there are the above situations, educate the village cadres. This is our opinion, which may not be practical, and we offer it for your reference.

    编辑同志：
    我是一个区公所干部（担任秘书工作），现在遇到一个问题，思想上弄不通，没法处理。问题是这样的：有个老婆，今年四十二岁了，是个军属，自她儿去年七月参军后，家里就只她一个人，经过翻身运动，现有地十余亩。本村住的一个外村老汉，也有四十多岁了，家里有六七亩地，也是他一个人，因在去年种地时，他不断给她家做地土生活，俩人就“搞上了关系”。可是最近村干部以为这个老婆是个军属，恐怕前方战士知道此事不满，因此就  把他们捉起来，把男人送区，当时这个老婆还来过区，诉说她家里没有人手，要求和那个老汉结婚，我当时对此问题，没有适当办法，请在贵栏答复是盼。
        潞城一区读者刘起富刘起富同志：
    据你信中所谈情形，我们觉得只要老婆老汉双方都出于真心自愿，是可以批准结婚的。当然，考虑老婆是军属是应该的，但这个老婆是个寡妇，并不是军人的妻子，政府法令是奖励寡妇再嫁的，况且老婆老汉都是单身人，老婆家又有地无人种的情况，找个这样的老汉正是门当户对，很合适的，假如两人结了婚，这家军属就能很好的建立家务。据我们想，村干部所以那样作，可能由两个思想所促成：一个是旧社会所遗留下的封建思想，觉得寡妇应该守节到老，这种旧思想应该打破。一个是以为那个老汉是“外路人”，存在对他歧视的宗派思想，这也是不好的。我们对外村人，应该团结帮助，特别是对这种鳏寡孤独的人，政府应该特别照顾，想法帮他们成家立业。你调查一下，如有上述情形的话，可向该村干部进行教育。我们意见就是这样，不一定切合实际，谨提出供你参考。
