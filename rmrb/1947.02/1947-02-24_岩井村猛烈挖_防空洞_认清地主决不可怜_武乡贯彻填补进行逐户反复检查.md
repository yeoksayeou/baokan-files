[Report from this newspaper, Licheng] In the Rock Well base village of the Second District, during the rent reduction movement, some individual farmers developed the idea of pitying the landlords and preserved property for them. After the leadership exposed the landlords' conspiracy and rewarded those who voluntarily reported hidden landlord items, the villages vigorously launched a "dig air-raid shelters" movement. The liberated serf group in the village had cadres and the masses jointly recall past suffering and discuss whether the landlords had been thoroughly struggled against and whether the landlords were truly pitiable. The Director of the Rock Well Military Committee said, "Landlord Zhang Wenjiao once arranged to assassinate cadres and put poison in the pond water we drink, wanting to poison us all to death. Think about it, what is there to pity about him?" Many cadres pointed out that the landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. For example, when checking household registrations, forty silver dollars and more than a dozen pieces of silk clothing were found in the home of landlord Zhang Gengchen, and good clothes hidden in a broken pillow and a package hidden in a haystack were found in the home of landlord Zhang Senxiang. These facts clarified the masses' thinking. Everyone said, "Look how cunning the landlords are! Hiding good clothes in a broken pillow, we can't be fooled!" After mass discussion, it was decided that those who voluntarily reported hidden landlord items would be rewarded with fifty percent. Zhang Xiaoheng, Wang Erpang, and ten other households successively reported 125 items of clothing and over 200 silver dollars, and were rewarded accordingly. Seeing these items, the masses all said, "We must dig 'air-raid shelters' well. We really haven't thoroughly dealt with the landlords!" (Wang Lüduan)

[Report from this newspaper, Taihang, 22nd] Wuxiang has preliminarily completed filling the gaps and is currently continuing to mobilize backward farmers. Earlier this month, the county party committee issued the instruction: "Implement thorough filling of gaps, conduct repeated checks door to door." At the same time, training classes were held in each district to train backward farmers (three to five people per village) to dispel ideological concerns. The training lasted three to five days and has now concluded throughout the county. Furthermore, typical investigations were conducted. Through this training and typical investigation, the cadres' complacency was shattered, and past fixed views were corrected. The cadres recognized the truth that "if the backward cannot be mobilized, the movement is not thorough, and the old rich will take advantage." Furthermore, class relations were established with the backward masses. Currently, the county has launched a widespread and in-depth movement to mobilize backward masses and check feudal remnants.

　　岩井村猛烈挖“防空洞”
    认清地主决不可怜
    武乡贯彻填补进行逐户反复检查
    【本报黎城讯】二区岩井基点村在查减运动中，个别农民产生可怜地主的思想，替地主保存财物，经领导上揭穿地主阴谋，奖励自动报出隐藏地主东西后，各村猛烈开展挖“防空洞”运动。该村翻身组让干部与群众共同回想过去的痛苦，讨论地主是否斗彻底，地主是否真可怜等问题。岩井武委会主任说：“地主张文焦曾经布置谋杀干部，把咱们吃的池水里放毒药，要想把咱们统统毒死，大家想想，他有啥可怜？”许多干部纷纷提出地主斗得不彻底：如清查户口时在地主张更辰家检查出四十块现洋，十几件绸缎衣服，在地主张森祥家搞出藏在破枕头里的好衣服，藏在草堆里的包袱。这些事实明确了群众的思想，大家说：“你看地主多鬼计！破枕头里藏好衣服，咱可不能上当！”经群众讨论：自动报出隐藏地主东西者奖励百分之五十。张小恒、王二胖等十户接连报出衣被一百二十五件，银元二百余块，分别予以奖励。群众看见这些东西，都说：“我们可得好好挖‘防空洞’，地主真没搞彻底哩！”（王履端）
    【本报太行二十二日电】武乡初步完成填补，刻正继续发动落后农民。本月初该县县委一面发出：“贯彻填平补齐，进行逐门逐户反复检查”的指示。一面在各区开办训练班，训练落后农民（每村三人至五人）解除思想顾虑。训练三天到五天，现全县均已结束，同时还进行了典型的调查。经过此次训练与典型调查，打破了干部的自满情绪，并纠正了过去的固定看法。使干部认识了“落后发动不起来，就是运动不彻底，老财要利用”的真理。并与落后群众建立了阶级感情。现该县已开展了普遍深入的发动落后群众，检查封建尾巴运动。
