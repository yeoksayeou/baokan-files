　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 25th: The Yan'an military spokesperson commented on the war situation, stating: The unprecedented great victory in Shandong has thoroughly shattered Chiang Kai-shek's plan to annihilate our army in the Southern Shandong campaign, and has caused Chiang's troops to suffer unprecedentedly severe blows, which will inevitably lead to extremely serious consequences for Chiang's army. The spokesperson highly praised all the soldiers of the Shandong People's Liberation Army and their leaders, Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu. The spokesperson pointed out: While concentrating forces to attack Southern Shandong, Chiang Kai-shek also ordered Hu Zongnan to concentrate forces in an attempt to attack Yan'an. After the Hu army invaded the Guantun area of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and occupied its capital, Ma, it is now transferring its main force, the reorganized First Division, from Southern Shanxi, crossing the Yellow River west from the Xicheng area, and is obviously actively preparing to attack Yan'an, the sacred site of democracy. Chiang and Hu's attack on Yan'an will inevitably follow the same disastrous path as in Southern Shandong, without a doubt.

　　延安军事发言人评战局
    鲁南蒋军遭受空前打击进犯延安必将蹈其覆辙
    【新华社延安二十五日电】延安军事发言人评论战局称：山东的空前大捷，已经彻底粉碎蒋介石企图在鲁南会战中歼灭我军的计划，并且使蒋军遭受空前未有的严重打击，因而必然引起对于蒋军是极其严重的后果。发言人盛称山东人民解放军全体战士及其领导者陈毅粟裕两将军。发言人指出：蒋介石一面集中兵力进攻鲁南，一面又令胡宗南集中兵力，企图进攻延安。胡军于侵犯陕甘宁边区关屯地区占领其首地马之后，现正由晋南插调其主力整顿第一师，由西城地区西渡黄河，显然北积极布置对民主圣地延安之进攻。蒋胡对延安的进攻，必将蹈其鲁南之覆撤，毫无疑问。
