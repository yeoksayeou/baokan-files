    Homemade Carbon Paper: Economical and Durable
    Today, everything is expensive. Even the cost of a sheet of carbon paper is higher than that of stencil paper. But we can't do without it. Here's a way to make carbon paper at home without spending any money.

    The method is very simple. After we've finished mimeographing, the mimeograph machine, the roller, and the stencil paper all have a lot of ink on them. This is often wasted. We can take a thin but tough piece of paper (thin hemp paper should be chosen, without lumps and even in texture), place it on top of the stencil paper with ink, and use the roller to roll over it, scraping all the ink adhering to the mimeograph machine onto this paper, until the ink penetrates and becomes a little moist. Then, this carbon paper is considered successfully made. Black ink makes black carbon paper, and blue ink makes blue carbon paper.

    After use, store it for future use. When storing, sandwich it between two sheets of paper, roll it up, and place it in a relatively humid place, because if it's too dry, the ink will easily evaporate. When it has been used for a long time and the ink is a bit dry, you can use the roller to roll on some more ink, and you can continue to use it.

    It has many advantages. Not only does it utilize waste and save money, but it is also more durable than ordinary carbon paper sold outside. Because in the places where the strokes have been written, the ink can slowly seep through again. As for the color it produces, it is also better looking than ordinary carbon paper, and looks very much like lithography. (West)

### 自制复写纸省钱又经用

    自制复写纸省钱又经用
    今天，样样东西都贵，就是买一张复写纸的钱，都要比腊纸贵些。可是又不能不用，这里就介绍一种不花钱自制复写纸的方法。
    做法很简单。我们印过油印以后，油印机上、滚筒上和腊纸上都有很多油墨附在上面，这往往都是浪费了的，我们就可以用一张薄而韧的纸（薄麻纸要搛上面没圪瘩而且匀的），垫在有油墨的腊纸上面，用滚筒在上面滚，把所有粘在油印机上的油墨，一起都刮来滚在这张纸上，直到油墨浸透而有点润湿时，这张复写纸就算做成功了。黑油墨成黑色的复写纸，蓝油墨成蓝色的复写纸。
    用过以后，把他保存起来，以后再用。保存的时候用两张纸挟着卷起来，放在比较潮湿的地方，因为太干燥了，油墨容易挥发。到用过很久油墨比较干些的时候，又可以用滚筒滚点油墨，一直可以继续用下去。
    它的好处很多，不但是利用废物节省了金钱，而且比外面卖的普通复写纸，还经久耐用些。因为写过笔划的地方，油墨又可以慢慢浸过来。至于他写出来的颜色，也比普通复写纸好看，很像石印。（西）
