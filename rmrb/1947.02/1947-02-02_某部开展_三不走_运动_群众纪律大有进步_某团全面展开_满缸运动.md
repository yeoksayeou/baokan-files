[Reported by our newspaper from the Jiluyu Front on the 31st] The reconnaissance and communications company of a certain unit launched the "Three No-Goes" movement, and mass work and mass discipline have greatly improved, and the morale of the soldiers has also greatly increased. The reconnaissance and communications company of a certain unit used to have relatively loose mass discipline and an insufficiently strict living system due to the large dispersion of work, which affected the morale of the soldiers. In order to change the past style, the leaders of the company proposed the "Three No-Goes" movement to the entire company: "Don't leave until the floor is swept clean, don't leave until the things are all delivered, and don't leave until the water in the jar is full." The implementation of this movement first involved "not forgetting one's roots" introspection among cadres and soldiers. At the introspection meeting, everyone reflected on past mistakes in violating mass discipline and examined their mass concept. After this political and disciplinary education, each squad proposed a "Three No-Goes" competition. After ten days, the whole company selected twelve mass work models. Zhang Xuezhu's squad planted more than ten ridges of garlic for the masses in ten days, took out two large carts of sweet potatoes, pushed twenty-eight carts of manure, and carried sixty-five loads of water. After practicing the "Three No-Goes" movement, the company not only made great progress in mass work, but also, because the soldiers' lives became regular, the style of leadership and soldiers changed, and the morale of the soldiers also increased. Now the "Three No-Goes" movement of the reconnaissance and communications company of the unit has been extended to all troops, which has improved the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people.

[Special dispatch from our newspaper] A certain regiment of the Fifth Sub-district of Jiluyu especially emphasized the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people in the guerrilla environment. The regiment specifically stipulated that each person should carry at least ten loads of water for the villagers every month. After mobilization, the full jar movement was launched throughout the regiment. Many comrades in the Second Battalion made plans to carry more than ten loads of water per month. Liu Donggui made a plan for twenty-five loads and carried thirty loads in four days; Wang Zhaoyi planned for thirty loads a month and completed it in five days; a communicator from a certain battalion said: "It's terrible, the landlord's jar is too small, so I have to scoop the water into his pots, cans, pots and bowls." The soldiers of each company also jokingly complained about "small jars." All the villages where the team was stationed were able to fill every household's jar. When living in Sunhai Village, soldier Wang Desheng carried a load of water and went to three houses but had nowhere to pour it, angrily saying: "I'll get up in the middle of the night tomorrow and see who gets there first." Some comrades who were not active enough saw others carrying water to their landlords' jars and blushed, saying: "Don't smear our faces, wait and see!" Under the influence, they also became active.

　　某部开展“三不走”运动
    群众纪律大有进步
    某团全面展开“满缸运动”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十一日电】某部侦（察）通（讯）连开展“三不走”运动，群众工作和群众纪律大有进步，战士情绪亦大为高涨。某部侦通连由于工作上分散性较大，过去群众纪律较松懈，生活制度也不够严格，以致影响了战士情绪。为转变过去的作风，连的领导上向全连提出“地扫不光不走，东西送不齐不走，瓮里水不满不走。”的“三不走”运动。这一运动的开展，首先在干部和战士间进行“不忘本”的反省，在反省大会上，每个人反省了过去违犯群众纪律的错误，检查了自己的群众观念。经过这一政治和纪律教育后，各班就提出“三不走”的竞赛，十天后全连选出了十二个群众工作模范。张学助班十天内共给群众种蒜十余畛，出红薯两大车，推粪二十八车，担水六十五担。实践了“三不走”运动后，该连不但在群众工作上有了很大进步，更由于战士生活走上正规，由领导到战士都转变了作风，战士情绪也高涨了。现该部侦通连的“三不走”运动已推广到全部队中，将拥政爱民工作提高了一步。
    【本报特讯】冀鲁豫五分区某团，在游击环境中，特别强调了拥政爱民工作，团里具体规定每月每人最少给老乡担水十挑。经动员后，满缸运动即在全团展开。二营很多同志订了超过每月十担水的计划，刘东桂订了二十五担，四天就担了三十担；王朝义计划一个月三十担，五天就完成了；某营通讯员说：“真糟糕，房东缸太小了，只好把水舀在他的盆罐锅碗里。”各连战士也都开玩笑似地怨“缸小”。所有该队驻村都做到了家家缸满。住在孙海村时，战士王得胜担着一担水走了三家也无处倒，气的他说：“我明天半夜里就起来，看谁占先。”个别不够积极的同志，看见别人担往自家房东缸里倒，红着脸说：“别往咱脸上抹灰，往后看！”在影响下也积极了。
