Xinhua News Agency, Jiaodong, February 14th: In the past ten days, the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army has recovered multiple towns and villages in northern Jiaodong and re-established five district governments. Jimo is pressing against the Jiang army and the Sugiyama stronghold. More than 30 villages have also been recovered north of Zhe County. In Southern Ye (southern part of the newly established Ye County), the Jiang puppet troops have been almost completely wiped out, and more than a hundred Jiang family village governments have been destroyed. In the Gaomi area, strongholds such as Zhangjiadun and Maojiatun have been recovered. The Jiang army's occupied areas in Jiaodong are experiencing a shortage of military strength and are resorting to aerial bombing, naval harassment, and sending special agents to infiltrate and carry out activities in an attempt to salvage the situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Shandong, February 13th: The Chiang army occupying Laiwu is terrified by the siege and attacks of local militia and guerrillas. The landmines laid by the militia extend directly to the vicinity of the strongholds, scaring the Jiang army into forcing livestock or civilians to lead the way with every step they take. From the 2nd to the present, the guerrillas have killed or wounded more than 400 Jiang soldiers in surprise attacks on the northeast of Laiwu city and south of Boshan. The two Jiang army communication lines, Bo (shan) Lai (wu) and Zhang (qiu) Lai (wu), extending over 200 li, have been completely destroyed, making it extremely difficult for the Jiang army to supply provisions.

　　胶东蒋占区兵力空虚
    我军收复村镇多处
    【新华社胶东十四日电】胶东八路军在过去十日中在胶北恢复村镇多处，重建了五个区政权，即墨逼至蒋军和杉山据点，浙县北亦恢复三十余村庄，南掖（新县掖县南部）蒋伪军几全被消灭，百余处蒋家村政权被摧毁。高密地区收复张家墩毛家屯等据点。胶东蒋军侵占区兵力空虚，正以飞机空袭，海舰滋扰及派遣特务潜入活动，图谋挽救困难。
    【新华社鲁中十三日电】侵占莱芜之蒋军，遭当地民兵游击队围困袭击，恐慌异常。民兵敷设之地雷等，直伸展至据点附近，吓得蒋军每行一步，驱牲畜或强迫群众开路前导。自二日至今，游击队于强袭莱芜城东北及博山以南等战斗中，共毙伤蒋军四百余名。到达二百余里之博（山）莱（芜）及章（邱）莱（芜）两条蒋军联络线已彻底破坏，蒋军给养运输困难万分。
