    The Newspaper's Various Departments Enthusiastically Engage in Production
    Production and Thrift to Greet the Dawn
    [This Newspaper News] Our newspaper is actively responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call, enthusiastically engaging in personal production within the organization. Since the establishment of the Production Committee on the 8th, comrades from all departments and sections have, in accordance with the administrative office's notice, determined production tasks of one to three hours for each comrade, based on their work and physical strength, with the exception of the cooks. After the mobilization meeting for production and thrift on the 11th, everyone's enthusiasm has been further heightened. The Production Committee calls on every comrade to regard production as equally important as work and study; to carry out production through "multiple varieties, free combination, and mutual aid," and to provide each comrade with a production fund of 3,000 yuan. In the past two or three days, comrades from various departments and sections have researched more than a dozen production methods, such as spinning, making shoes, rolling cigarettes, printing, and growing vegetables, all of which are practical and concrete. For example, the comrades in the Electrical Department, with an average task of three hours, plan to charge three boxes of batteries, print two hundred sheets of telegram paper, and make ten whistles each day, which will amount to at least five thousand yuan, making the completion of the task no problem. The Research Department and the General Affairs Section are studying collective production plans, while individual comrades have already started making shoes, spinning yarn, and collecting manure. Currently, the Production Committee is entrusting specialists to go out to solve the problem of spinning wheels and negotiate cigarette rolling and other issues. It has been decided that the entire newspaper will generally enter the production movement after the 20th.

    本报各部门工作同志热烈进行生产
    生产节约迎接光明
    【本报讯】本报积极响应薄一波同志号召，热烈进行机关个人生产。自八日成立生产委员会后，各部、科同志均按行政处通知，根据每个同志的工作、体力，确定除炊事员外，均有一至三小时的生产任务。十一日召开全机关生产节约动员大会后，大家情绪更为高涨。生产委员会号召每个同志必须把生产和工作、学习看得一样重要；要“多种多样，自由结合，变工互助”的进行生产，并贷给每个同志生产基金三千元。两三天来，各部科同志已研究出纺织、做鞋、卷烟、印刷、种菜等十几种生产办法，都很实际具体。如电务科同志平均三小时任务，计划好每天充电三匣，印收电纸二百张，做口哨十个等，至少能大洋五千元，完成任务不成问题。研究部、总务科一面研究集体生产计划，同时个别同志已开始做鞋、纺线、拾粪。现在，生产委员会正托专人外出解决纺车，交涉卷烟等问题。决定二十号以后全社即可普遍进入生产运动。
