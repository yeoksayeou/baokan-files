The People's Daily Jilu Yu Frontline, 10th report: The directly subordinate units of the Frontline Field Headquarters convened a summary meeting on the work of supporting and cherishing the people during the half-year self-defense war on the 8th at their station, and awarded model individuals for supporting and cherishing the people. In the past six months, the various units of the department have made remarkable achievements in supporting and cherishing the people under tense working conditions. In terms of helping the masses in production, the Third Brigade alone helped the masses harvest 315 mu of millet last autumn, hoe 20 mu of land, pulled 37 large and small carts of sorghum beans, and carried 85 loads of manure. The Fourth Brigade universally carried out the "Full Jar Movement," and universally carried out "writing one village after staying in one village" and "opening the mouth" for writing slogans and oral publicity to the masses, improved the organization of the civil affairs group, and conducted social investigations in an organized manner as soon as they arrived at the station to help local mass work. In the past six months, various units have selected 58 models of supporting and cherishing the people, including Yin Shimin, Qiao Tongbao, Zhang Baoyin, Cao Jian, and Gu Wenxing, including staff officers, soldiers, administrative personnel, and telephone operators. Soldier Yin Shimin led the whole squad to help the masses harvest 28 mu of crops in less than half a month, and changed the Dingzhuang landlord's incorrect understanding of the Eighth Route Army in helping production. Telephone operator Qiao Tongbao wrote 167 slogans in half a year, publicized 257 people, and led the carrying of 460 loads of water. Zhang Baoyin wrote 5,000 slogans in half a year, and actively learned the local dialect from the local masses in order to publicize to the masses. Gu Wenxing, a feeder liberated from the Kuomintang army during the Lanfeng Campaign, has never violated mass discipline since joining the Eighth Route Army. In addition to helping the masses with work himself, he can also help others carry out mass work. During the current month of supporting and cherishing the people, various units conducted introspection among cadres and soldiers in order to do a better job of supporting and cherishing the people, and launched competitions. Cadres and soldiers of various departments helping the villagers in the recovered areas to stand up has become one of the daily tasks. During the month of supporting and cherishing the people, the Fourth Brigade of the department made the greatest progress in supporting and cherishing the people.
    The People's Daily Jilu Yu Frontline, 10th report: Gu Wenxing, a feeder from the Fourth Company of the Fourth Brigade of the Jilu Yu Frontline "Peace" Department, who was liberated from the Kuomintang army, was selected as a first-class model for supporting and cherishing the people. Last year, he was captured by the 181st Brigade of the Kuomintang army in his native Henan and forced to serve as a soldier. In August of the same year, he was liberated by the Eighth Route Army during the Lanfeng Campaign and became a feeder in the department. He enthusiastically helped the villagers with work in his spare time. He helped the landlord feed horses, sweep cowsheds and courtyards, and carry water for the villagers every day, so the masses were very kind to him, and three old ladies specially sewed cotton quilts for him. No matter which village he lived in, the villagers welcomed him very much. He also told the villagers about the suffering of the masses in the Kuomintang-occupied areas and mobilized them to carry out the struggle to stand up. When he was in Shouzhang County, he went to the district office to collect horse feed. The district chief had a bad attitude towards him. He explained humbly, which caused the district chief to conduct self-criticism. Li Chenglang, a cook from the company who was liberated from the Kuomintang army, was worried about his captured brothers and his family in the Kuomintang-occupied area and could not concentrate on his work. Gu Jingxing said to him: "Your brother has been liberated by the Eighth Route Army just like us. As long as we defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we can go home." Li Chenglang cleared his mind and worked actively and enthusiastically helped the villagers with work. On the 4th of this month, when Gu Jingxing was selected as a first-class model of supporting and cherishing the people, he said with emotion: "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are all for the people and do not bury good people. I will give everything I have."
