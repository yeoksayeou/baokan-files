    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. The Han and Yi people of Xikang's Ya'an and Ningyuan continue to resist Chiang's troops' "encirclement and suppression." According to a Chengdu dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on January 27th, fierce fighting in various parts of Ya'an has caused setbacks for Chiang's troops within the county. Chiang's troops in Lingguan County near Ya'an were besieged, and it is reported that a certain regimental commander was also captured. Furthermore, according to news from the Ronghua West China Daily: tens of thousands of armed Yi people from Guojizhi in Liangshan and Puxiong, and the middle and lower Puxiong Yi people, belonging to Ningchang (Xichang), are bravely resisting "suppression." As of early January, they had caused serious difficulties for Chiang's troops. Chiang's army deputy commander, a certain Sun, telegraphed his subordinates, saying that the Yi people were "united and strong, and stubbornly resisted based on their advantageous terrain," making it very difficult for the "suppression" army to advance. The telegram also revealed that the Kuomintang authorities have now adopted a shameless assassination plot, hoping to heavily reward the assassination of the Guojizhi Yi people's leader, Hahe Qinghe Lumu Zi. It is also learned that Chiang's troops are prepared for a long-term "suppression" of twelve years. A spokesman for the Xichang Equipment Department stated: "Combat aircraft have been approved to remain in Chang for a long time to assist in the suppression." On January 29th, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published an editorial on this massacre policy of the Chiang government, stating: "The darkness of local politics and the complexity of ethnic issues are ignored by the government, which stubbornly believes that rebellion must be dealt with by force. This is a dangerous and reckless move. The people do not fear death, why use death to frighten them!" It also stated: "Using aircraft to bomb backward people is not a wise move."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. According to news from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: The Chiang government's conscription in Sichuan is extremely brutal, and the people are resisting it. Last month, the Guang'an County authorities used the pretext of showing free movies to lure county residents into the venue and implemented conscription, pulling away more than a hundred people in one night. On the 13th, when more than 300 conscripts were escorted for departure, the families of the conscripts went to block them, and some grabbed the escorting officers and soldiers and fought desperately. Qian, from Jiangmen Township in Xuyong County, had three sons. The eldest son was conscripted to Sichuan and has not returned, the second son is disabled at home, and the youngest son is fourteen years old and studying at the central school in the township. On December 30th, on his way home from school, he was caught by the Baojia chief and others and taken to the township office. The township head said that the student had been selected and should enlist in the army. His mother died of grief. Two police officers from the Toutu Township Public Office in Nanchuan County forcibly conscripted Wang Dongliang on the 4th of last month. Wang was filled with irrepressible anger and stabbed the two policemen with a sharp blade before fleeing elsewhere. In Zigong City, southern Sichuan, conscription has been rampant recently. Every night, the sounds of chickens crowing, dogs barking, women weeping, and children crying can be heard. To avoid being captured by the authorities, the citizens are exposed to the wind and rain and sleep in the wilderness, changing their location several times in one night. The Ta Kung Pao stated: At present, the supply of conscripts has been exhausted, and it is difficult for the authorities to make up the quota even with indiscriminate arrests.

    西康夷民英勇反抗“清剿”
    雅安宁远蒋军受挫
    天津大公报猛抨蒋介石屠杀政策
    【新华社延安八日电】西康雅宁两属汉夷民，继续反抗蒋军之“进剿”。据津大公报一月二十七日成都专电透露，雅属各地战事激烈，已使县境之蒋军遭受挫败，雅安附近灵关县蒋军被围，并传某团长亦被俘去。又据蓉华西日报消息：宁昌（西昌）所属凉山、普雄之果鸡支夷民及中下普雄夷民数万武装，英勇反抗“清剿”，截至一月初，已使蒋军遭受严重困难。蒋军副司令孙某曾电其部属谓：夷民“团结坚强，据险顽抗”，“进剿”军进展甚难。电中在披露国民党当局现已采用无耻的暗杀阴谋，想重赏刺杀果鸡支夷民领袖哈合青合鲁木子。另悉：蒋军且已准备作十二年之长期“进剿”。西昌设备部发言人称：“作战飞机已奉准长期留昌协助进剿。”一月二十九日，津大公报对蒋政府此一屠杀政策发表社评称：“地方政治的黑暗，民族问题的复杂，政府置之不顾，硬认为叛乱必须施诸武力，这是危险卤莽的举动。民不畏死，奈何以死惧之！”并谓：“以飞机轰炸落后人民，非明智之举”。
    【新华社延安九日电】据津大公报消息：蒋政府在川征兵，备极残暴，人民时予反抗。广安县当局上月以放映免费电影为名，引诱县民入场，实行拉丁，一夜拉去百余。十三日解送壮丁三百余名出发时，壮丁家属前往拦阻，有扭住解送官兵拚命者。叙永县属江门乡钱氏所生三子，长子被征出川未返，次子残废在家，幼子十四岁肄业该乡中心学校，十二月三十日由校返家中途，被保甲长等抓住，押至乡公所后，乡长谓该生已中签，应入营服役。其母因悲痛过度，气绝而死。南川县头渡乡乡公所警丁二名，上月四日强拉壮丁王栋良，王怒不可抑，当执利刃将二警刺倒逃遁他方。川南自贡市近来抓丁，每到深夜，辄闻鸡鸣犬吠，妇啼儿号之声；市民为逃避官方捕捉，不避风雨，露宿荒郊，一夜之间，数易其地。大公报称：目前壮丁业已枯竭，官方乱抓亦难足额。
