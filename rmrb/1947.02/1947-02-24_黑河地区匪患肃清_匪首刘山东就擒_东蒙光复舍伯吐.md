Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd: The military and civilians of Heilongjiang Province have captured Liu Shandong, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit leader and commander of the Mixed 6th Brigade. The banditry in the Black River area has now been completely eliminated. Liu was originally a Hun bandit. After the liberation of northern Manchuria, he disturbed the Black River area under the name of Chiang Kai-shek's "underground army." Later, he split into two groups. One group fled to the Wuyun area, and the other group once fled west to the borders of Nenjiang, Nehe, Dedu, and other counties. After being severely suppressed by the local military and civilians, they fled back to Black River. On the 2nd of this month, bandit leader Liu Shandong and Chiang's secret agent Chen Duowei and others were captured at the same time. In addition, his deputy brigade commander Liu Hanchen, regimental commander Li Wanchen, and 350 others were killed. It is also reported that Zhang Dongshan (bandit name Zuo Shan Diao), commander of the 2nd Detachment of the Northeast 9th Column of the Chiang bandits who disturbed the Mudanjiang area, and 25 others have also been captured on the 1st.
    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 22nd: (Delayed) The Mongol-Han Allied Forces recovered Shebotu, the location of the Dongke Banner Democratic Government in eastern Mongolia, on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The Mongol-Han people celebrated the Spring Festival with the People's Liberation Army with unparalleled joy. Shebotu is located 90 li northwest of Tongliao. It was occupied three times by units of Chiang's 71st Army and Chiang's bandit gangs on November 9th of last year and January 1st and 20th of this year. When the Chiang bandits occupied the area, they seized men and grain, and abused the families of the Mongolian Autonomous Army. In the severe winter cold with wind and snow, they forced residents to dismantle windows and destroy doors to build bunkers and fortifications, and dug shelters and trenches in the streets and suburbs, causing the people to suffer greatly. In this battle, the Mongol-Han Allied Forces entered the area after two hours of fierce fighting. The Chiang bandits suffered 200 casualties, and the remaining troops fled back to Tongliao.

    东蒙光复舍伯吐
    【新华社东北二十二日电】黑省军民已擒获蒋记匪首混成第六旅旅长刘山东，黑河地区匪患至此全告肃清。刘原系胡匪，北满解放后，即以蒋介石“地下军”名义窜扰黑河地区，后又分两股，一股东窜乌云一带，另股曾西窜嫩江、讷河、德都等县边境，经当地军民痛剿后回窜黑河，至本月二日，匪首刘山东及蒋家特务陈多卫等同时落网。另击毙其副旅长刘汉臣、团长李万臣以下三百五十人。另悉窜扰牡丹江地区之蒋匪东北第九纵队第二支队司令张东山（匪号坐山雕）以下二十五人亦已于一日被擒。
    【新华社西满廿二日电】（迟到）蒙汉联军于旧历除夕光复东蒙东科旗民主政府所在地舍伯吐，蒙汉人民以无比喜悦与人民解放军共度春节。舍伯吐位于通辽西北九十里，曾于去年十一月九日及今年一月一日与二十日三度遭蒋军七十一军所部及蒋记匪股侵占。蒋匪盘踞该地时，曾抓丁抢粮，凌辱蒙古自治军家属，在风雪交加的隆冬严寒中，威逼居民拆窗毁门，构筑碉堡工事，并在街头及城郊挖掘掩体与壕沟，人民备受荼毒。此次蒙汉联军经二小时激战进驻该地，蒋匪死伤二百人，余部窜回通辽。
