Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 26th: Yesterday, the *Liberation Daily* editorial "Peel Back Another Layer" launched a powerful attack on the fascist atrocities committed by the Kuomintang authorities in Beiping, who recently arrested more than 2,000 people from all walks of life in the city within a week. The editorial stated: "Peeling back a layer of rouge and powder, the hideous face of the 'democratic Chinese model' under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership has recently reappeared in Beiping." It pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek has arrested and killed countless people over the past twenty years, and this is what Chiang Kai-shek calls "democracy and freedom," and what Marshall praises as the "democratic Chinese model." The editorial listed numerous anti-people atrocities committed by the Chiang government during and after the convening of the sham "National Assembly" which was meant to "return power to the people": For example, the assassination of Zhu Xuefan in Hong Kong on November 25th of last year, the Shanghai hawker incident on November 30th, the arrest of 3,000 people in Guangzhou on December 7th, and the repeated beating and killing of patriotic propaganda students by secret agents in Chongqing on February 5th and 8th of this year, the Shanghai massacre on February 9th, etc., proving that the atrocities have intensified under the guise of the "democratic constitution." The editorial said: "Chiang Kai-shek's rule is a prison, it is hell, and his 'democracy' and 'constitutionalism' are bloody fascist dictatorship; the people under the rule of this 'democratic' regime are nothing more than slaves of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, and their lives and deaths are at the mercy of this small group of the most corrupt figures. Isn't this obvious?"

The editorial believes that the following erroneous arguments, which are clearly helping the demon Chiang Kai-shek, must be refuted:

One argument is that under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, China can gradually move towards democracy. This is just the nonsense of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, the new ogre heads and horse faces hired by the ghoul Chiang Kai-shek. The facts are as clear as they can be. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is only relying on the design of his American boss, waving the banner of "democracy," and moving towards a more ruthless fascist dictatorship. The reason why he wants to wave the banner of "democracy" is precisely because the Chinese people have become so unprecedentedly awakened that, apart from using the guise of "democracy" to temporarily cover up his fascist dictatorship and deceive both at home and abroad, it is difficult for him to survive in any other way.

Another argument is that since the civil war exists, there is no such thing as political consultation. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) line can be abandoned, the PCC resolutions can be ignored, and Chiang's fake constitution can exist. As long as the "democratic parties" and "social elites" participate in the government and vigorously "strive," then democracy can be achieved. This argument is actually only helping Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship. Its subjective purpose is only to seek an official position from the four families and gnaw on a few bones; its only effect is to act as a vicious dog for Chiang Kai-shek. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party's "participation in the government" is just like this.

Another argument is that Chiang Kai-shek is indeed bad, but he is still the "legitimate" leader "recognized at home and abroad," and the Chinese people should try to make him a good person, so that China can achieve democracy. The essence of this argument is to ask the Chinese people to submit to a despotic emperor. Everyone knows that the despotic dynasty of the Manchus, the reactionary rule of Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlords, when they were in power, were they not "legitimate" rulers "recognized at home and abroad"? However, Sun Yat-sen did not recognize this rule as legitimate, and the Chinese people did not recognize this rule as legitimate. Sun Yat-sen and the Chinese people only recognized this rule as a traitorous, despotic, and corrupt rule that must be overthrown. Now Chiang Kai-shek's rule is at least ten times worse than the rule of the Manchus and the Northern Warlords. And the Chinese people's expectations and patience for him are at least ten times greater than Sun Yat-sen's treatment of the Manchu royal family and the Northern Warlords. The Chinese people have been too good to Chiang Kai-shek. They have been expecting and tolerating Chiang Kai-shek for a full twenty years, asking him to abandon evil and return to righteousness, and asking him not to be a ghost, but to be a good person. But a ghoul is, after all, a ghoul, and he will never become a human being, let alone a good person. Even today, he is still launching large-scale offensives against the liberated areas and arresting and killing large numbers of patriotic and democratic people. Peeling back the skin, what is Chiang Kai-shek? It is still the old saying of the *Ta Kung Pao* on April 7, 1930, that he is a devil who "says all the good words, but does all the bad things"; or as Mr. Chen Jiageng said correctly, that Chiang Kai-shek wants democracy, "that is like seeking the skin of a tiger; the result is not only that democracy cannot be obtained, but those who ask for it will be killed."

The editorial finally called on the people of the whole country to strive for the abolition of Chiang's fascist misrule and for the realization of genuine democracy and freedom throughout the country. It pointed out: "Everyone who is sensible knows that if people are afraid of ghosts, the ghosts will be fierce and ruthless. If you are not afraid of ghosts at all, then there will be no ghosts. What's more, the Chinese people today already have their own Zhong Kui, who is wholeheartedly making contributions for the people. No matter how many heads and arms and what backers Chiang Kai-shek, this ghoul, has, let's see where he can escape!"

### 再剥开一层皮看  蒋家统治就是牢狱  解放日报评北平蒋特滥捕人民

　　再剥开一层皮看
    蒋家统治就是牢狱
    解放日报评北平蒋特滥捕人民
    【新华社延安二十六日电】昨日延安解放日报社论“再剥开一层皮”，对北平国民党当局最近一周内逮捕平市各界人士二千余人之法西斯大暴行，提出有力之抨击。社论称：“剥开一层胭脂水粉的皮，作为蒋介石领导下的‘民主中国型式’的狰狞面目，最近又在北平再现了一次色相。”指出二十年来蒋介石抓人杀人千千万，这就是蒋介石自称的“民主自由”，也就是马歇尔所称颂的“民主中国的型式”。该社论列举“还政于民”的伪“国大”开会期间及开会以后，蒋政府各种反人民暴行已数不胜数：例如去年十一月二十五日朱学范在港遇刺，十一月三十日上海摊贩事件，十二月七日广州三千人被捕，今年二月五日及八日重庆特务再度殴杀爱国宣传学生，二月九日上海惨案等等，证明暴行反在“民主宪法”的掩护下变本加厉起来。社论说：“蒋介石的统治就是牢监，就是地狱，他的‘民主’‘宪政’也就是血腥的法西斯专政；在这个“民主”政权统治下的人民，都不过是蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族的奴隶，其生杀予夺只能一任这一小群最腐败人物的摆布，这还不明显吗？”
    社论认为，显然系为恶魔蒋介石帮腔的下列几种错谬论调必须加以驳斥：
    一种说法是，在蒋介石的统治下面，中国能够逐渐走向民主。这只是狞鬼蒋介石新雇的牛头马面青年党、民社党的屁话。事实摆得再明白也没有，蒋介石今天只是靠着他美国老板的设计，打着“民主”的旗帜，走向更狠辣的法西斯专政。其所以要打着“民主”的旗帜，也正是因为中国人民已经有了如此空前的觉醒，以致除了用“民主”这套胭脂水粉的外衣来暂时掩盖其法西斯专政、来对待内外进行欺骗之外，很难再有其他的方法来苟延残喘了。
    再有一种说法，认为内战既然存在，就无所谓政治协商。因此，政协路线可以抛弃，政协决议可以不管，蒋记伪宪可以存在，只要各“民主党派”与“社会贤达”参加政府大力“争取”，那么民主就可以实现。这种说法，实际上只能是对蒋介石法西斯专政的帮腔。其主观目的，只是想从四大家族膀下求得一官半职，嚼几根骨头；其唯一的效果，就是替蒋介石当凶恶的狗腿子。青年党、民社党的“参加政府”，就是如此。
    再有一种说法，认为蒋介石果然坏，但他仍然是“中外公认”的“合法”的领袖，中国人民应该好好争取他成为好人，这样中国就可以得到民主了。这种说法的实质，也就是要中国人民向一个专制帝王屈服。谁都知道，满清的专制皇朝，袁世凯和北洋军阀的反动统治，当其在朝之时，他岂不是“中外公认”的“合法”的统治？但是，孙中山不承认这种统治为合法，中国人民也不承认这种统治为合法，孙中山和中国人民只承认这种统治是卖国专制腐败的统治，而必须推翻。现在蒋介石的统治，比起满清和北洋军阀的统治来至少要坏过十倍。而中国人民对于他的期待和忍耐，比起当年孙中山的对待满清皇室与北洋军阀来，至少超过十倍。中国人民对待蒋介石实在是太好了，他们对蒋介石期待和忍耐了足足二十年，要他改邪归正，要他不要做鬼，好好做人。但是，狞鬼，终于是狞鬼，他终不会变做人，更不会变做好人。直到今天，他还是向解放区大举进攻，要大批捕杀爱国民主人士。剥开皮来看，什么叫做蒋介石呢？那还是民国十九年四月七日大公报所讲的老话，就是“好话为先生说完，而坏事为先生做尽”的魔鬼；还是陈嘉庚先生讲得对，他说蒋介石要民主，“那是与虎谋皮；结果非但民主要不到，要求者反有杀身之祸。”
    社论最后号召全国人民为废除蒋记法西斯恶政、争取全国真正民主自由而努力。指出：“凡是懂事的人都知道，人若存心怕鬼，那鬼就凶就狠。若是根本不怕鬼，那鬼就没有了。何况中国人民今天已经有了他们自己的钟馗，他一心一意为人民立功。蒋介石这个狞鬼，任凭他有三头六臂和什么靠山，看他还能逃向何处！”
