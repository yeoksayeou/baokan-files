Short Commentary:

　　After the upsurge of production and thrift arises, a crucial link to consolidate and develop it lies in having organizational, and especially individual, plans. With individual plans, it becomes possible to gradually inspect, supervise, and strive for their realization. Without individual plans, the upsurge will not be sustainable. Individual production plans should include production time, production types, production organization, and wage amounts. They should not merely be a general scope but rather the result of concrete investigations and precise calculations (many individual production and thrift plans published in this newspaper can be used as references). Having annual plans requires formulating more specific monthly plans based on them. Monthly inspections and summaries should be conducted according to the plans, with commendations, evaluations, and encouragement. Labor emulation campaigns can then be launched, ensuring the completion of tasks.

　　制定个人生产节约计划
    生产节约的热潮起来以后，要巩固并发展它，必须有机关的特别是个人的计划，这是一个主要环节。有了个人计划就可逐步检查督促，争取实现。如无个人计划，则热潮将不能持久。个人生产计划中应包含生产时间，生产种类，生产组织和工资数量等。它不应只是一个笼统的范围，而应是具体调查与精确计算的结果（本报已发表的许多个人生产节约计划可作参考）。有了全年计划，还要根据它再定更具体的每月计划。按照计划每月检查总结，报功评功、表扬鼓励，立功运动就可开展，完成任务就有保证。
