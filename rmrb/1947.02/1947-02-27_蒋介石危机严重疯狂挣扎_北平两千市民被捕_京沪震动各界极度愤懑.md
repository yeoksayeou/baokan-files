　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 25th: According to a Beiping dispatch: An unprecedented fascist atrocity of trampling on personal freedom has recently occurred in Beiping. In the week from the 14th to the 20th of this month, more than two thousand people from all walks of life have been arrested by the Chiang government. These include local gentry, professors, students, members of the Democratic League, primary school teachers, government officials and other citizens. Among those arrested are philologist Fu Dingyi, Xing Ting, a famous book collector of a wealthy family in Hebei Province, Wang Zhixiang, a professor at Peking University, and Zhang Zongying, the son of Zhang Dongsun. It is reported that this atrocity was instigated by Chiang Kai-shek and carried out by Wu Zhiren, the head of Chiang's secret service and chairman of the Beiping Municipal Party Department, Zhu Weiping, the deputy director of the police bureau, Ma Hansan, the director of the civil affairs bureau, and Zhang Gongrui, the director of the headquarters inspection office. After the atrocity occurred, Beijing, Shanghai and other places were shocked. Many newspapers published the news in prominent positions, and people from all walks of life were extremely indignant. It is generally believed that this fascist atrocity fully demonstrates that Chiang Kai-shek's ruling crisis has become increasingly serious and he is now engaged in a frantic struggle to suppress the surging patriotic and democratic movement across the country.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 25th: In response to the unprecedented atrocity of the Chiang government in Beiping arbitrarily arresting more than 2,000 citizens from all walks of life, the famous jurist Mr. Chen Jinkun specially invited reporters to make a statement, saying: This is Chiang Kai-shek's military failure becoming more and more serious, his politics becoming increasingly bankrupt, and his economy increasingly heading towards total collapse, a frantic struggle; this is a manifestation of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule becoming weaker and weaker in the face of the people's democratic forces. In the end, Mr. Chen firmly stated: "This extraordinarily large-scale crime in Beiping once again exposes Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to persist in civil war and dictatorship, which will arouse deeper anger from the people of the whole country towards the Chiang government."
