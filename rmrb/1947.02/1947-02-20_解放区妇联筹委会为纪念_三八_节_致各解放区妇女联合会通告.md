The Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas Issues Circular to Women's Federations of All Liberated Areas in Commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day

　　(1) The central tasks for commemorating "March 8th" this year:
　　(1) Make the greatest effort to mobilize the broad masses of women in a timely manner to support the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, organize women to participate in the war, crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and strive for the arrival of victory.
　　(2) Step up and timely mobilize women to participate in the land reform struggle. The more women mobilized, the more widespread, the better. In the rural emancipation movement, oppressed women should also be emancipated. Break the feudal shackles in social systems and customs for thousands of years so that women can better exert their strength, support the patriotic war, thoroughly solve the land problem, and participate in various constructions in the liberated areas.
　　(3) Check women's production undertakings, further widely and deeply organize women, carry out spring plowing after obtaining land, develop agricultural production, and step up the promotion of textile and other industrial production to improve women's lives and develop the economy of the liberated areas.
　　(4) Demand that the U.S. military completely withdraw from China, oppose American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, abolish the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, and care for and support the patriotic student movement across the country and the struggle of the people in the KMT-controlled areas for freedom and survival.

　　(2) The method of commemorating "March 8th" this year is mainly to mobilize women cadres to go to the countryside and combine with the broad masses of women to strive to achieve the above tasks. Practical actions and practical work should be the most meaningful commemoration. In addition, on March 8th, various regions can decide on appropriate commemorative methods according to the war situation and environmental possibilities, and based on women's interests and needs.

　　(3) During the commemoration of "March 8th," local women's federations should give verbal and written awards and commendations to female heroes and model workers in the patriotic self-defense war, land reform struggle, and production front.

　　(4) Slogans for commemorating "March 8th" this year:
　　(1) Women, unite and strive for China's independence, peace, and democracy!
　　(2) Women, unite as one, demand that the U.S. military completely withdraw from China, oppose American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, abolish the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, demand an immediate cessation of aid to Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas, and strive for China's national independence!
　　(3) Women, rise up and strive to abolish the pseudo-constitution, reopen the National Assembly, and restore the CPPCC line!

　　(6) Women, rise up and actively participate in the land reform movement, strive for the fruits of land reform, and women must also be emancipated in the peasant emancipation movement!
　　(7) Better and more deeply organize women to participate in spring plowing, consolidate the fruits of the land struggle, and step up the development of the textile industry!
　　(8) In order to develop women's labor force, ban foot-binding, promote foot-unbinding, and oppose the abuse of women!
　　(9) Organize production, child-rearing, and love work, promote women's health, and achieve both prosperity in people and wealth!
