　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st -- TASS, New York: The United States Department of Agriculture recently announced its plan to destroy 20 million bushels (620,000 tons) of "surplus" potatoes. This has drawn sharp criticism from the New York Post, which stated that the United States is destroying "surplus" food while many Asian and European countries are suffering from hunger. The destruction of potatoes is only the first instance of the US implementing its policy of destroying food to maintain the commercial price of agricultural products. For many years, the US government has been asking farmers to plant less wheat, even rewarding farmers who leave their wheat fields uncultivated, so as to avoid overproduction of wheat that would lead to lower prices, thereby reducing the profits of most grain merchants.

　　欧亚各国饥饿声中
    美将大量毁坏食粮
    【新华社延安三十一日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：最近美国农业部宣布准备毁坏二千万布舍尔（合六十二万吨）“剩余”马铃薯。此事引起纽约邮报尖锐的攻击，该报称美国毁坏“剩余”食粮，而许多亚洲、欧洲国家则正遭受肌饿，毁坏马铃薯仅是美国实行毁坏食粮以保持农业生产品商价政策之第一次，此仅为美国毁坏粮食之一例。多年来美政府即要农民少种小麦，甚至奖励不种小麦而让麦田荒芜之农家，以免小麦生产过剩而致价格下跌，使大部粮商利润减少。
