　　Taiyue Troops Improve Quality, New "Jiao Wubao" Figures Continuously Emerge
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 30th] The Jiao Wubao mutual aid movement has now penetrated deeply into the Taiyue troops, and new "Jiao Wubao" figures are emerging one after another. The First Battalion of the 409th Unit universally conducted discussions and education. During the Jicheng Campaign, each unit was able to concretely apply and develop Jiao Wubao's leadership methods, and many new "Jiao Wubao movement activists" emerged. Hao Deming of the Second Company taught all the new recruits in his squad shooting aiming and utilizing terrain and features in just over ten days, and emboldened the new recruits during combat. During training, he often said to the new recruits, "Sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime." Therefore, the new recruits' actions have indeed improved quickly. Three "Jiao Wubao movement activists" have also emerged in the Third Company, enabling the rapid improvement of the troops' quality. Comrade Sun Jingniu of the First Company of the 19th Military Sub-district is also a Jiao Wubao-type figure, and treats new recruits exceptionally well on the battlefield. Liu Deliang, a soldier of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment, wrote to the military region's newspaper saying: "Our company's squad leader of the Fifth Squad implements mutual aid well, carrying bedding for others, unafraid of fatigue. After arriving at the station, he also helps everyone with chores. This time, in the 'Yicheng Campaign,' under his mutual aid, the completion of the combat mission was guaranteed."
