    Downstream Riverbed Residents Reluctantly Relocate
    Democratic Government Provides Relief
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 13th dispatch] Residents of Puxian, Yunbei, Hechuang New Village and villages along the river, through which the Yellow River flows, are moving west with the old and the young in tow. Our democratic government is providing relief and arranging housing for the victims. After Liqiao Village in Puxian County was flooded by the Yellow River, all the houses were washed away due to the rapid current, and the property was buried at the bottom of the river and could not be salvaged. Before the Lunar New Year, the village planted more than 20,000 trees on the riverbed, and all of them were submerged in the water when the Yellow River suddenly rose. Calculating each tree at 500 yuan, the loss amounts to 10 million yuan. Now the villagers are wading in the water to salvage what they can, and three more people have frozen to death. Shi Naimiao in Yunbei County was a village established by the democratic government only the year before last. All of the more than 500 new houses built by more than 100 households in the village were washed away and turned into yellow sand after the Yellow River flood. The villagers said angrily: "The Eighth Route Army built houses for us, and Chiang Kai-shek released the water to destroy the houses."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th dispatch] More than 2,000 households in more than fifty villages in the riverbed of the lower reaches of the old course of the Yellow River in the Lijin liberated area are reluctantly relocating with the old and the young in tow to escape the Yellow River disaster. The democratic government has dispatched a large number of vehicles and livestock to assist them in their relocation, and is trying to make room for housing to properly resettle them. The relocated residents are all extremely saddened to see the thousands of acres of fertile land they have cultivated for many years about to be submerged by the rolling Yellow River.

    下游河床居民忍痛搬家
    民主政府正进行救济
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】黄水流过濮县、郓北、河床新村与沿河村庄居民，均纷纷扶老携幼，往河西搬家。现我民主政府正进行救济，并按排灾民住地。濮县李桥村被黄水淹没后，因水势太急，所有房屋，全被冲坍，财物沉葬河底，无法打捞。该村年前在河床植树木二万余棵，黄水骤来悉没水中，每株按五百元计算，损失即达千万元之巨。现该村居民涉水打捞，又被冻死三人。郓北县石奶奶庙，是民主政府在前年才辟的村庄，全村百余户人家所盖新房子五百多间，黄水过后，全被冲平，变为黄沙。全庄居民愤慨的说：“八路军给咱盖房子，老蒋放水来破房子。”
    【新华社山东十三日电】黄河故道下游利津解放区河床五十余村庄二千余户居民，为逃出黄水灾害，正扶老携幼忍痛迁移。民主政府派大批车辆牲口协助彼等迁居，并设法让出房屋妥为安置，迁移居民看见经营数年之千里沃野即将为滚滚黄水所淹没，无不痛慨万分。
