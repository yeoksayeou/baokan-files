Jining County Draws Over Three Hundred Activists
    To Help with Mass Movement in Newly Recovered Areas

    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 30th] Jining has recently drawn village cadres and activists from the Fourth and Fifth Districts, totaling over three hundred and fifty people, to help with the mass movement in the new districts. The Fourth and Fifth Districts are famous as "mother-child" districts in carrying out work. After the recovery of Jining City last year, a large number of village cadres and activists were sent to help the poor in their movement to turn the tables. Recently, due to the liberation of the Huxi area of ​​Jining County, the Fourth and Fifth Districts immediately drew fifty village cadres, concentrated them for training, and sent them to work in the new districts. They also organized a propaganda team of two hundred people, including stilt walkers, colored lanterns, flower boats, dragon lanterns, and Yangko dancers, in addition to propaganda groups, investigations, condolences, and writing slogans. They have already started working in Diangui Village, in the First District. Before arriving in the village, the masses heard the sounds of drums and gongs and saw the colorful actors, rushing from all the streets and alleys. At this time, we began to speak, talking about our army annihilating fifty brigades of the Chiang army, recovering Jiaxiang, Juye, and Liaocheng, and surrounding Jinxiang and Yutai. The masses all listened with smiles and attentive ears. Then came the actors' performance. This kind of propaganda is extremely popular with the masses and is very effective.

　　济宁县抽调三百余积极分子
    帮助新恢复区群运
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】济宁顷自四、五区抽调三百五十余个村干、积极分子帮助新区群运。四、五区以开展工作的“母子”区著名，去年济宁城收复后，曾派大批村干积极分子帮助了穷人翻身运动。最近由于济宁县湖西地区的光复，四、五区又马上抽了五十个村干集中训练后，开往新区工作，并组织了二百人的宣传大队，内有高跷、彩灯、花船、龙灯、秧歌，此外还有宣传组，调查慰问写标语，已开始在一区甸贵屯进行工作。未到此村，群众听到鼓锣声音，看到花红柳绿的演员，争先恐后的从各街巷口拥挤而来。就在这时，我们开始讲话，讲到我军消灭蒋军五十个旅，光复嘉祥、巨野、聊城，包围金乡、鱼台时，群众都面带笑容，侧耳静听。随后就是演员表演。这样的宣传方式极受群众的欢迎，收效极大。
