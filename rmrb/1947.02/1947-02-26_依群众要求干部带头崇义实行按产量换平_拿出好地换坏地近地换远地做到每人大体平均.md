　　Following the Masses' Demands, Cadres Take the Lead in Chongyi to Implement Land Equalization Based on Output
	Taking out Good Land to Exchange for Bad Land, Near Land to Exchange for Far Land to Achieve a Roughly Average per Capita Distribution
	[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Chongyi Village (new district), Wuan Eighth District, has victoriously completed land reform after half a month of in-depth filling and patching. The progress is introduced as follows: Since liberation, through five movements, the peasants have recovered a total of 4,183 mu of land. The poorest farmers received an average of four mu per person, reaching the village's average per capita amount. From a formal perspective, it seems that land reform has been completed, but in reality, the problem is still very serious. The village's average output per person is 2.78 dan, but nearly a hundred of the 349 newly emancipated peasant households do not meet this standard. Some even have an average of more than four mu per person, but the output is only two dan. Even many of the former middle peasant households do not meet this standard. Although the "filling the holes" movement in December of last year filled the "holes" in the quantity of land, the "equalization" of output has not yet been addressed. Therefore, further "filling and patching" from the perspective of output has become the demand of the masses.

	The Tide of Voluntary "Equalization"

	Although "equalization" from the perspective of output has become the demand of the masses, how to get cadres, activists, and newly emancipated households who exceed the output to contribute land for "equalization" is a very difficult problem to handle. Although this movement has recovered another 70 mu of land that can be filled, it is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem. It is necessary to make a major change to the land that has been distributed in the past year.

	To carry out this work, in addition to educating the masses ideologically, the leading role of cadres and activists is the decisive key to the success of the movement. Therefore, it is very important to first straighten out the thinking of cadres and make them establish the concept of serving the people.

	Village Head Yang Guozhu has a family of five, 22 mu of land, and an average output of 4.3 dan per person. After straightening out his thinking, he voluntarily gave up 10 mu of good land to the masses. He said, "My emancipation depends entirely on everyone. Too many people need nearby land, and I am willing to give up 10 mu." The chairman of the farmers' association also voluntarily gave up six mu. Cadres promoted activists, and activists promoted the masses, so voluntary "equalization" became a tide. Everyone was talking about this on the streets and alleys. Newly emancipated households that exceeded the output were willing to equalize. They said, "When it comes to merit, the cadres have the greatest merit. They are willing to volunteer, so why should we fall behind?" People with more nearby land talked to those with more remote land, and people with excess output talked to those with insufficient output, to voluntarily exchange. Everyone praised this as "finding an object" and "touching hearts."

	Leadership in "Equalization"

	In order to make this work proceed quickly and fairly, they divided into five streets to carry out the work. Cadres participated in the leadership separately, in order to master and exchange experiences. The principle is an average of four mu of land and 2.87 dan of output per person. As far as possible, everyone should have nearby land, remote land, good land, and bad land. The method is to first let everyone declare themselves, to see the number of households that are returning land and the number of households that need land, and then make adjustments. According to the situation of everyone "finding an object," see if it meets the standards, and then adjust and fill in the gaps. Everyone participated in the discussion, and everyone became a reviewer.

	The Problem of Old Middle Peasants

	There were 99 old middle peasant households in the village before liberation, with an average of four mu of land per person. The gap between their output and the standard output is not too big. However, the output of the emancipated middle peasant households has largely exceeded that of the old middle peasants. Therefore, this movement is basically a matter of the new middle peasants "voluntarily" giving up land. According to the survey, the highest output in the old middle peasant households is no more than 3.5 dan, while the output of the new middle peasants exceeding 4 dan is quite a lot. Some old middle peasants' output slightly exceeds the standard, and they want to "volunteer," but they are rejected. For old middle peasant households with no labor force who "volunteer" to give land, because they are willing, consideration is given to accepting it. In addition, there are many old middle peasant households that do not meet the standard output. For example, the Jin Rong family has 10 people, 30 mu of land, and an average output of only 1.9 dan per person, which is also "filled" according to the standard output.

	Several Considerations

	The standard output has been determined, but it cannot be the same for every household. It must be considered according to different situations.

	1.  Military dependents, as long as they have labor, can exceed the output. Generally, it is 3 to 3.5 dan, which should not be too high, and should be based on being relatively wealthy, otherwise it will cause conflicts between military dependents and the masses. For military dependents without labor, try to allocate nearby land. In order to take better care, the village has let everyone voluntarily declare the land they are cultivating on behalf of military dependents. Some are cultivating 3 mu on behalf, and some are cultivating 5 mu on behalf, completely voluntarily forming groups, which can save a lot of trouble. 2. Widows, widowers, and those without labor are also given special care, and they are given nearby land as much as possible. 3. For bachelors, their future marriage problems must be taken care of. The general output is 5 dan, and the highest is 7 dan. The principle is that people with fewer people have more output. Newly emancipated middle peasants, due to their poor foundation, can exceed the standard output. The poorer they are, the more output they have, so that they can "fill" their "gully," but it should not be too different.

	Solving Two Problems

	1.  The general masses, due to the lack of labor (according to the survey, each livestock in the village cultivates an average of 50 mu of land), want nearby land, so everyone is scrambling for nearby land, forming a problem. When mediating this problem, those with lower output or those with less nearby land are given priority. If everyone's output and nearby land are similar, it can be distributed equally.

	2.  Some households exchange nearby land for remote land, but the nearby land is planted with wheat, and they are reluctant to give it up. The solution is to exchange it after the wheat is harvested, but the right to the land is already fixed. Some remote land is planted with wheat and they want to exchange it for nearby land. The solution is for both parties to split it in half. This can further promote the enthusiasm of everyone to voluntarily exchange land.

	Repeated Inspection After Fair Distribution

	After the land distribution in a street is completed, everyone should be allowed to discuss it again to thoroughly check whether it is fair and reasonable, so that everyone can speak when distributing and no one can say anything after the distribution. Then the cadres of each street will collectively study and discuss it again to see if there are any incomplete or mutually protective phenomena. Finally, a general meeting is held to pass it until everyone has no objections.

### 依群众要求干部带头崇义实行按产量换平  拿出好地换坏地近地换远地做到每人大体平均

　　依群众要求干部带头崇义实行按产量换平
    拿出好地换坏地近地换远地做到每人大体平均
    【本报特讯】武安八区崇义村（新区）经半月来的深入填补，现已胜利完成土地改革。兹将其进展情形，介绍于下：该村自解放后，经过五次运动，农民共收回土地四千一百八十三亩，赤贫农每人平均到四亩地，达到全村每人平均数。从形式上看，似已完成土地改革，而实际上问题还很严重。该村每人平均产量为两石七斗八，可是新翻身的三百四十九户农民，就有近百户达不到此标准。有的甚至每人平均超过四亩，而产量只是两石，就连过去的老中农户也有很多达不到这一标准。虽然去年腊月的“填窟窿”运动，但只填了土地数量上的“窟窿”，产量上的“补齐”还没注意到。因此进一步的从产量上“填平补齐”已成为群众的要求。
    自愿“换平”的热潮
    从产量上“填平”虽已成为群众要求，但如何使超过产量的干部、积极分子、新翻身户献出土地“换平”，却是十分难处理的问题。虽然此次运动又收回七十亩地可以填补，但“杯水车薪”无济于事。必须将过去一年中已分配好的土地来一次大变动。
    进行这一工作，除在思想上教育群众外，干部、积极分子的带头作用，是运动成功的决定关键，于是首先打通干部思想，使他们确立为人民服务的观念，是十分重要的工作。
    村长杨国柱五口人，二十二亩地，产量每人平均四石三斗。在打通思想后，自愿退出十亩好地给群众。他说：“我翻身全靠大家，需要的近地太多了，情愿退出十亩。”农会主任也自愿退出六亩。干部推动积极分子，积极分子推动群众，于是自愿“换平”成为一种浪潮。街头巷尾无不在谈此事。新翻身超过产量户，都愿换平。他们说：“论功劳还是人家干部功劳大，人家都愿意自动，咱为啥要落后呢？”近地多的人，找远地多的谈，超过产量的人，和产量不足的谈，来自愿交换。大家称道为“找对象”“碰心事”。
    “换平”中的领导
    为使此一工作进行得迅速、公平，他们分开五道街进行。干部分头参加领导，以便掌握与交流经验。原则是每人平均四亩地、两石八斗七产量。尽可能做到人人有近地、远地、好地、坏地。办法是先让大家自报，看退地户与要地户若干，后再进行调剂。根据大家“找对象”的情形，看是否合乎标准，后再调剂填补。讨论时，大家都参加，做到了人人都当评议员。
    老中农问题
    该村老中农在解放前是九十九户，每人平均土地四亩，他们的产量和标准产量的悬殊并不太大。但翻身的中农户产量，绝大部分已超过了老中农，因而此次运动基本上是新中农“自动地”的问题。据调查：老中农户内产量最多的也不过是三石五斗，而新中农产量超过四石的却很不少。有些老中农的产量，多少超过标准一点，他们想“自动”，但也遭到拒绝。对于家内无劳力的老中农向外“自动”的，因为他们是甘心情愿，才考虑予以接受。另外在老中农户里，也有不少是达不到标准产量的。如靳容家，十口人，三十亩地，每人平均产量才一石九，这也按标准产量予以“填平”。
    几条照顾
    标准产量是确定了，可是又不能户户都是这样，必须根据不同情况予以照顾。
    一、军属只要有劳力，可以超过产量。一般的为三石至三石五，不能太高，应以较富裕为原则，否则会引起军属与群众间的矛盾。对于无劳力的军属，尽量分配近地。为能照顾得更好，该村已将给军属代耕的地让大家自报。有的给代耕三亩，有的给代耕五亩，完全自愿结合成小组，这可省去很多麻烦。二、孤寡无劳力的，也特别照顾，尽可能使其种近地。三、对于光棍汉，必须照顾其将来成家问题。一般的产量为五石，最高的到七石。原则是人少的产量多。刚翻身的中农，由于基础差，产量可超过标准，越穷，产量越多，这样可“填平”其“圪道”，不过不宜悬殊太大。
    两个疙瘩的解决
    一、一般的群众，由于劳力缺乏（据调查全村每头牲口平均耕五十亩地），故都想要近地，因此凡是近地大家抢着要，形成一个疙瘩，调解此问题时，是先尽产量低的要，或近地少的要。如果大家产量近地都差不多，可平均分配。
    二、有些户拿近地换远地，可是近地种的是麦子，又舍不得。解决的办法是麦子收割后再换，可是土地的权柄已经固定。有的远地种的是麦子，想换近地，办法是双方对半分。这种更能促起大家自愿换地的热潮。
    公平分配后  反复检查
    在一个街土地分配结束后，应再让大家讨论，彻底检查是否公平合理，真正做到分时人人都讲话，分后人人无话说。然后各个街干部，再到一块集体研究讨论，看是否有不彻底，或相互包庇的现象。最后召开全体大会通过，到大家无意见时为止。
