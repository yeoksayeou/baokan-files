    Spinning Wheel Needs Improvement
    If you want to spin yarn quickly and well, it is very important to improve the hand-cranked spinning wheel. In some places, the spinning wheels are made with a wheel diameter of only two chi (尺 - a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 meter). Because it is too small, it slows down the spindle, which reduces production. Generally, each person spins only three or four liang (两 - a traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 50 grams) per day. If the wheel is enlarged (diameter increased to two chi six cun (寸 - a traditional Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/10 chi) to three chi), each person can spin at least two liang six qian (钱 - a traditional Chinese unit of weight, approximately 1/10 liang) to three liang five qian more yarn per day. Another improvement is to add a speed-up wheel between the large wheel and the spindle frame. The rope of the wheel and the rope on the spindle are both connected to this speed-up wheel, which can spin even faster. However, this type of wheel requires skilled spinners; beginners may find it difficult to spin well due to the fast rotation. Furthermore, the spindle is best made of wood. If wood is not available, iron spindles should be straightened to avoid slight bending, and a length of about one chi two cun is appropriate. The distance from the spindle frame to the crank should not exceed two chi four cun (it can be slightly longer with a speed-up wheel). The spindle rope should be crossed when attaching it to avoid slippage and reduce speed and output.

    纺车要改良
    要想纺纱纺得快、纺得好，改良手摇纺车很要紧。有些地方做的纺车，车轮直径不过两尺长，因为它太小了，使锭子转得慢，产量便减少。一般每人每天不过纺三、四两。如果把车轮加大（直径增长到二尺六寸到三尺）的话，每人每天至少要多纺二两六钱到三两半纱。另外是在大车轮与锭架之间，加一个加速轮，车轮的绳与锭上的绳都连到这个加速轮上，可以纺得更快，不过用这种车，熟纺手才行，生手因转动快反而纺不好。再就是锭子，最好是木质的，如没木的，铁锭则要取直，勿使稍弯曲，长度约一尺二寸为宜。锭架距摇把，不要超过二尺四寸（有加速轮的可稍长些）。锭绳要交叉着上，以免滑脱，减少速度与产量。
