【Reported by our newspaper in Weixian on the 2nd】After Chiang's puppet troops occupied Daming on January 1st, Comrade Yan Mingqian of the Third District of Weixian frequently led the militia to operate behind enemy lines, attacking the enemy puppets and persisting in guerrilla warfare in the area east of Chuwang. On the morning of the 6th, two squads of Chiang's puppet troops attempted to cross the river east of Gucun to plunder. Yan Mingqian led a militia unit to ambush the south bank of the Wei River, and when the enemy approached, they fiercely fired at the enemy. As a result, one enemy soldier was wounded and a bicycle was seized. On the evening of the 9th, they attacked the Chiang's puppet troops guarding the river crossing. The machine gun swept the small house of Chiang's puppet troops on the opposite bank, so that Chiang's puppets dared not show their heads. Militia Li Jinduo, under the cover of the machine gun, crossed the river in a dustpan prepared in advance and recaptured the boats of Chiang's puppet troops on the north bank. Two squads of militiamen boarded the boat and crossed the river. Chiang's puppet troops resisted in the house. The militia threw a burst of grenades and rushed into the house, capturing two Chiang soldiers. The rest abandoned their guns and fled north, and two more were killed or wounded by the militia. A total of four rifles and one donkey were seized. The militia escorted the prisoners and returned happily.
    【Reported by our newspaper in Weixian on the 1st】The guard battalion of the Ninth Military Subdistrict actively fought against Chiang Kai-shek to make meritorious service. When Chiang's army retreated and crossed the bridge at Walin River Estuary via Linzhang, the 2nd platoon of the 4th company of the battalion took the opportunity to pursue. Approaching the enemy, they concentrated fire and fired fiercely, killing and wounding 18 enemy soldiers. One platoon each of our 2nd and 4th companies stationed in Dabuzhuang repelled several attacks by two companies of the enemy. In several battles, a total of more than 30 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and we only wounded four and killed one. All the commanders and fighters of the battalion have more confidence in winning the struggle against the enemy.

　　魏县三区民兵坚持游击战争
    【本报威县二日电】一月一日蒋伪军侵占大名后，魏县三区阎明谦同志经常带领民兵，活动于敌后，袭击敌伪，坚持楚旺以东一带的游击战争。六日上午，蒋伪军两班，企图由谷村东渡河抢掠。阎明谦带领民兵一部，埋伏卫河南岸，等敌人接近时，向敌猛烈扫射。结果打伤敌人一名，缴获自行车一辆。九日晚，又袭击守卫河渡口的蒋伪军。机枪照着对岸蒋伪军的小屋扫射，打得蒋伪不敢露头。民兵李金铎在机枪掩护下，坐着事先准备好的簸箩渡河，将北岸蒋伪军船只夺回。两班民兵上船过河，蒋伪军恃屋抵抗，民兵打了一阵手榴弹，冲进屋内，捉蒋军两名。其余弃枪北逃，又被民兵毙伤二名。计获步枪四支，驴一头，民兵押着俘虏，高兴而回。
    【本报威县一日电】九分区警卫营积极抗蒋立功。当蒋军撤退临漳经瓦林河口渡桥时，该营四连二排乘机追击。逼近敌人，即集中火力猛射，毙伤敌十八名。我驻大部庄二、四连各一排，曾击退敌两个连的数次进攻。几次战斗共毙伤敌三十余人，我仅伤四人，亡一人。全营指战员对敌斗争胜利信心更高。
