　　All Employees of the Newspaper Printing Plant
    Conserve Materials and Work Hard to Produce
    [Our Newspaper] The employees of our newspaper's printing plant, responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call for "Production and thrift to welcome the light" and the Trade Union Federation's "Meritorious Service Campaign," are engaging in intense large-scale production and a materials conservation movement. Based on the characteristics of our plant, we are primarily focused on completing the newspaper's publication tasks. Under this general principle, we reward "more work, more pay" and undertake the printing of various books, forms, and propaganda materials for "both public and private benefit." At the same time, we are organizing all surplus labor for agricultural and small-scale handicraft production. Typesetting workers, material clerks, correspondents, and cooks primarily engage in agricultural production in their spare time, and also raise pigs and grind tofu. Engraving workers undertake the engraving of official seals, private seals, official stamps, and various other seals. The female comrades of the proofreading section are organizing the sprouting of soybeans, etc. In terms of conservation, we ensure that not a single bit of paper, ink, lead, iron, or coal is wasted. Comrade Li Chengcai, a correspondent, has already taken the lead by sifting out more than ten kilograms of coke from the coal accumulated last winter. All comrades unanimously stated: "In order to respond to the call of the higher authorities, support the front lines, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, we must bring out the spirit of production we had during the War of Resistance, and with just our two hands, we are confident that we can produce more wealth for the border region." In order to perform more meritorious services for the people, the employees have voluntarily proposed public assignment tasks for their spare-time production. All employees are currently formulating detailed production plans and conservation programs, and the movement is in full swing. (Cheng Fang)
