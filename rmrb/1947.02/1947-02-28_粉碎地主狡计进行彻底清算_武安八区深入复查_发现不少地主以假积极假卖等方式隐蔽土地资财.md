　　Smash Landlord Tricks and Conduct Thorough Liquidation
    In-depth Review in the Eighth District of Wu'an Reveals Many Landlords Concealing Land and Wealth Through False Activism and Sham Sales
    [Our Newspaper] Although the "cutting the tail" movement was launched vigorously in the twelfth lunar month of last year in the eighth district of Wu'an, many village landlords still live in good houses, retain near and good land, and even individual landlords have not touched their hidden wealth at all, and have not bowed their heads politically. During this land investigation, a meeting of village cadres was first convened to explain the cunning of the landlord class, and to call on everyone to conduct a serious and careful inspection. When the district work team inspected Shunyi Village, the village cadres said, "Our village has been thoroughly dealt with." Only after in-depth investigations among the masses did they discover that the cadres were protecting the landlords. The landlord Kang Tianxiu in the village had never been struggled against, and even those who had been struggled against were not thoroughly dealt with. Those who had served as puppet Baochang (local security chief under Japanese occupation) in the past are now also participating in the peasant association, and many backward peasants are still keeping things for the landlords. The masses had raised objections to the cadres, but were scolded in return. Now, more than twenty new activists have emerged in the village, and the masses have been re-mobilized to thoroughly liquidate the landlords. In Wencun in the district, it was previously thought that the landlords were poor and there was nothing to struggle against, but this time another fifty taels of silver ingots were found. In Shangquan Village, it was found that seventy or eighty peasant families were short of housing, and the landlord Liang Baotang (female) pretended to be very active in order to avoid struggle and served as the deputy leader of the women's team. The masses said, "No one dares to struggle against her now that she is a cadre." No one dared to raise objections to the fact that the son of the landlord He Qingyuan was a primary school teacher. Now, with the help of the district cadres, a general liquidation of the landlords has been launched. During the land investigation in Sanbaishu, it was discovered that the sale of twenty mu of land by the landlord Long Weiyu to his long-term worker Zhi Qiu was a sham. Now Zhi Qiu is still feeding a mule with him. When digging for "hidden wealth", it was found that his family's clothes were scattered throughout the remaining villages, and even farm tools were buried underground. A "change of dynasty" ledger was also found, recording who took his land and house, and more than one hundred red contract documents were discovered. This issue has now attracted great attention in the district. Currently, in addition to a few villages that are discussing land distribution, most are conducting in-depth reviews to smash landlord tricks and conduct thorough liquidation. (Tian Lin)

　　粉碎地主狡计进行彻底清算
    武安八区深入复查
    发现不少地主以假积极假卖等方式隐蔽土地资财
    【本报讯】武安八区虽经去年腊月轰轰烈烈的割“尾巴”运动，但有不少村地主住的还是好房，留的是近地、好地，甚至个别地主内货丝毫未动，政治上也没低头。此次查田时，首先召开了各村干部会议，说明地主阶级的狡猾，号召大家认真的仔细检查。该区工作员到顺义庄检查时，村干部说：“俺这村早彻底了。”在群众中深入调查后，才发现干部为地主包庇。该村地主康天秀从未斗过，其他斗过的也不彻底，从前当过伪保长的，现在也参加了农会，不少落后农民还给地主保存东西。群众曾向干部提意见，但反被骂了一顿。现该村已涌现出二十几个新积极分子，重新发动群众向地主彻底清算。又该区温村，过去认为地主穷，没什么可斗的，这次又弄出五十两元宝。上泉村又查出七八十家农民缺房子住，地主梁保堂（女）为躲避斗争，装得很积极，担任妇女副队长。群众说：“人家当了干部可不敢斗。”地主何清源家的儿子当着小学教员也无人敢提意见。现经该区干部帮助，已掀起对地主的总清算。三柏树在查田中，发现地主龙维雨卖给其长工智秋方二十亩地是假的，现别人还跟他伙喂着一条骡。挖“内货”时，发现他家衣服疏散遍到余村，就连农具也埋在地下，并查出“变天”账一本，写着谁要了他的地和房子，并要出红契文书一百多张。现此一问题，已引起该区极大重视，目前除少数村正讨论分配土地外，大部分正深入复查，粉碎地主狡计，进行彻底清算。（天林）
