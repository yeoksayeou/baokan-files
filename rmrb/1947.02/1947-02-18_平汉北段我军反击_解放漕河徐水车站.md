Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: Just as the Chiang Kai-shek troops were invading westward from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, occupying Yi County and peering at Tanghu Town on the south bank of the Yishui River, the Eighth Route Army on the Pingbei Front launched a counterattack in self-defense. On the morning of the 13th, they once again liberated Caohe and Xushui stations north of Baoding, and besieged the Chiang Kai-shek troops' strongholds of Tiancun, Jingtangpu, and Liu Xiangdian. All the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in the above-mentioned areas were annihilated.
