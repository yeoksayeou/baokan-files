Short Commentary:

　　Vigorously Launch the Merit Campaign
Our heroic troops have achieved brilliant results in carrying out the merit campaign. This new leadership method should be widely carried out in all rear-area organs, schools, and organizations to improve our work. We must respond with full enthusiasm to Chairman Yang's call at the Border Region Government Committee. The merit campaign is to promote the initiative and creativity of the masses, to guide everyone to come up with ideas, to find solutions, to overcome all difficulties, and it is a manifestation of the mass line advocated by the Party. Any indifference or apathy towards this new leadership and working method is incorrect.
    Carrying out the merit campaign must truly come from the masses and implement the combination of leadership and the masses. How to report merits, evaluate merits, record merits, and reward merits, how to establish merit committees, merit books, merit plaques, etc., can be created by everyone according to the specific situation. Many materials published in the newspapers can be used as a reference. The initial standards should not be too high to avoid restricting the development of the movement. Those who lag behind should be helped in a planned manner. Those who have not made merits should strive to make merits, and those who have made merits should not be proud or complacent, and strive to add merit to merit. In the enthusiastic production and conservation of various organs, this movement must be carried out.

　　大力开展立功运动
    我们的英勇部队在开展立功运动中已得到辉煌的成绩，这一新的领导方法，应在一切后方的机关、学校和团体中广泛开展起来，把工作提高一步。杨主席在边府委员会上所做的号召，我们要以满腔热忱去响应。立功运动就是发扬群众的积极性和创造性，就是引导大家出主意，人人想办法，就是克服一切困难的法宝，就是党所提倡的群众路线一种表现的形式。对于这种新领导方法与工作方法，任何冷淡与漠不关心都是不对的。
    开展立功运动要真正从群众中来做，要贯彻领导与群众相结合。如何报功、评功、记功、奖功、如何成立立功委员会、功劳簿、立功牌等等，可按具体情况大家创造。报上发表的许多材料可作参考。开始标准不应过高，以免限制运动发展。对于落后层要有计划的加以帮助。未立功者人人争取立功，已立功者不骄傲、不自满，争取功上加功。在各机关热烈的生产节约中，必须把这一运动开展起来。
