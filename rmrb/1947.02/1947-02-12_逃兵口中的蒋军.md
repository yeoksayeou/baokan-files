    The KMT Soldiers as Told by a Deserter
    Wang Dexiu

    Comrade Song Ying of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, got separated during the Central Plains Breakout and hid in the homes of the people of Lushi County. On his way home, he was captured by KMT soldiers and assigned to the First Company of the First Battalion of the 16th Independent Engineer Regiment as a new recruit. After working for more than a month, he seized an opportunity to run back to the Liberated Area. He talked in detail about the inside story of the KMT army. The main points are recorded below:

    The 16th Engineer Regiment only has two battalions. In October of last year, one battalion was annihilated by the Eighth Route Army, and most of them were captured. Now the Second Battalion alone has more than 60 returned prisoners of war. Both battalion commanders were also captured by us twice. When originally formed, each company had 140 to 150 people, but now they only have 50 to 60 people left. More than 48 people ran away from Puyang after living there for ten days, and more than 40 people ran away from Weihui after living there for ten days. Three platoon leaders have run away. Four hundred new recruits were replenished in Henan, but only two or three of those who ran away are left. In his class, seven out of thirteen people ran away, leaving only six.

    Why did they run away? Some said, "There's no way to fight, can't stand it!" Some said, "Good guns can't hold out either. You can't find them when you're fighting, and grenades come at night when you're not fighting!" Some people are desperate to go home, and some want to go back to the South to eat rice.

    Their officers deceived people by saying that the artillery regiment had wiped out seven regiments of "traitorous troops" in a city, but the soldiers didn't believe it. The people and the soldiers were all saying, "The Eighth Route Army surrounded seven divisions and the Fifth Artillery Regiment in Xuzhou with 200,000 troops. They are all real Eighth Route Army of Mao Zedong." People spread rumors one after another, "The Eighth Route Army is going to counterattack!" Although the officers' speeches and the slogans of the political department all said "traitorous troops," "traitorous party," and "traitorous bandits," the soldiers didn't believe those nonsense. All they said was "Commander Liu," "Eighth Route Army," and "local Eighth Route Army."

    Despite your officials talking about the "traitorous troops" implementing the "Three Alls Policy;" the soldiers, especially those who had been captured, didn't believe it. They secretly said, "Our Nine Alls are enough; trees cut down, bricks dismantled, beds and dowries burned, vegetables eaten, chickens caught, baskets and carrying poles used up, civilians conscripted, strong men captured, and women raped." The day they borrowed a bed from the common people, saying they were going to sleep, the next day the villagers went to see that the bed had turned to ashes.

    Raping women is open, and the soldiers run around visiting door to door. The officers know about it, but they don't say anything. Old soldiers stay out at night and ask new soldiers to stand guard for them, 2,000 yuan at one o'clock. Song Ying himself stood guard for them four or five times.

    Whether they are officials or soldiers, gambling is open, and they do it whenever they are idle. Soldiers can lose 700,000 to 800,000 yuan a night, and some even lose 2 to 3 million yuan. If they don't have money, they use gold rings as collateral. When they run out, three or five of them go to other villages for a trip. Then they have it again.

    Where does this money come from? Isn't it extortion from the common people! There is also a source, which is selling bullets. The superiors issue 100 bullets to each person, but in fact each person only gets 30 to 40 bullets, and they all sell them. If there is an inspection, the squad leader will borrow bullets from other squads for his brothers.

    On the surface, when Chiang Kai-shek is mentioned, they stand at attention, but behind their backs they all say, "China is dead. Chiang Kai-shek has ceded everything south of the Yellow River to the United States."

    The Engineer Regiment is Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, and its corruption is so unbearable, how can it not collapse at the first blow?

    逃兵口中的蒋军
    王德秀
    新四军五师的宋英同志，中原突围时掉了队，隐藏在卢氏县老百姓家中。返家途中，被蒋军抓去，编到独立工兵十六团一营一连当新兵。干了一个多月，乘隙跑回解放区，谈蒋军内幕情形甚详，择要记在下面：
    工兵十六团，只有两个营，去年十月间被八路军歼灭了一个营，大部被俘。现在光二营就有放回的俘虏六十多人。两个营长也都被我们俘过两次。原编时每连百四五十人，现在都只剩五六十人了。在濮阳住了十来天，一夜就跑了四十八人，卫辉住了十来天，又跑了四十多人。排长中有三个跑了。在河南补充了四百个新兵，跑的只剩下两三个了。他在一班上，十三个人就跑了七个，只剩下六个。
    他们为啥跑呢？有的说：“没法打，吃不住！”有的说：“好枪也顶不住。打时找不见了，不打时黑夜里手榴弹来了！”有些人是一心想回家，有些人是想回南方吃大米。
    他们的长官诳人说炮兵团在一个城里，消灭了“奸军”七个团，但士兵都不相信，老百姓和当兵的都乱说：“八路军二十万包围了徐州七个师和炮五团，都是毛泽东的真八路”。人们纷纷传说：“八路军要反攻了！”尽管长官讲话，政治处的标语都说什么“奸军”、“奸党”、“奸匪”，但当兵的那里信那些鬼话，一说就是说“刘师长”、“八路军”、“八路军地方”。
    尽管你当官的讲“奸军”实行“三光政策”；但当兵的尤其被俘过的都不信。暗里都乱说：“咱九光也够了；树砍光、砖拆光、床和嫁妆烧光、菜吃光、鸡捉光、筐筐扁担用光、民夫要光、壮丁抓光、妇女奸光。”头天借老百姓床，说是要睡，第二天老乡去看，床都成了灰了。
    奸淫妇女是公开的，当兵的乱串门，当官的知道了也不吭。老兵在外住夜，找新兵替站岗，一点钟二千元，宋英自己就替站了四五次。
    不论当官的、当兵的，赌博公开，一闲就干。当兵的一晚上能输七八十万，还有输二三百万的。没钱用金镏子顶，输光了，三五人到外村一趟。又都有了。
    这些钱那里来？还不是讹老百姓的！还有个来源，就是卖子弹，上边每人发一百粒，实际每人只三四十粒，都卖了。如遇检查，班长还替弟兄到外班借子弹呢。
    对于蒋介石表面上一提蒋主席就立正，但背后都说：“中国是亡了，蒋介石把黄河以南都划给美了。”
    工兵团是蒋军的嫡系，其腐败不堪，如此怎能不一击即溃呢？
