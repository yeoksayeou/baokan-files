    Child Poet Miao Deyu
     New clothes, so clean and bright,
     A red flower pinned upon my chest.
     My brother is going to the battlefield,
     Joining the main force to defend our home.
     Cloth-soled shoes, sturdy and strong,
     Sent to my brother at the front lines.
     It’s just a small token,
     Expressing my little brother's warm heart.
     A small towel, white and long,
     My brother takes to the front lines.
     You can use it to wipe away sweat,
     Wipe your eyes clear for better fighting.
     A notebook, with a long pencil,
     My brother takes to the front lines.
     Study hard to learn more characters,
     Become a champion scholar and warrior.
     Small bayonet, big rifle,
     My brother carries to the battlefield.
     Brother, brother, listen to me,
     Defeat the reactionaries and then come home.
    This is a poem written by Miao Deyu, a child poet from Miao Family Village, Yinan, Lunan, for his brother who is joining the army. He is fourteen years old this year and is a worker-peasant correspondent for the "Dazhong Daily" in central Shandong. When he was young, due to bad harvests, his father fled famine to the Northeast, and he grew up relying on his mother's upbringing. At the age of nine, he attended Leshentang private school. Later, he studied diligently and assiduously. After achieving economic emancipation, his enthusiasm for studying culture became even higher, and he wrote more than two hundred news poems in two years. Because he is a peasant child who has been emancipated and participates in various current work, the articles he writes are very vivid and closely integrated with current work, and are welcomed by the general peasants.
    When Miao Family Village was liberated, Miao Deyu was only eleven years old. He led and organized the children's corps and wrote children's corps jingles. His family had two mu of land, and when he participated in the labor exchange team, he wrote a short song for the labor exchange team. During the land redistribution movement, he wrote more than a dozen kinds of emancipation ballads. His spirit of hard self-study is especially admirable. During the busy farming season, he often wrote until late at night. Sometimes, after thinking of the content at night, he would get up early in the morning to start writing. He not only wrote himself, but also helped others write. He went to neighboring villages to promote the establishment of newspaper correspondence groups. Now the Shandong Central Youth Federation, the Shandong Central Dazhong Daily, and the Xinhua News Agency Shandong Central Branch have jointly rewarded him and called on all members of the Youth Salvation Association and worker-peasant correspondents to learn from him and launch a broad worker-peasant cultural emancipation movement.

    儿童诗人苗得雨
     新衣服，净光光，
     一朵红花挂身上。
     我家哥哥上战场，
     参加主力保家乡。
     布底鞋，壮又壮，
     送给哥哥上前方。
     本是一点小意思，
     表表弟弟的热心肠。
     小毛巾，白又长，
     哥哥带着上前方。
     你在前方擦汗用，
     擦得眼明好打仗。
     日记本，铅笔长，
     哥哥带着上前方。
     学习文化多识字，
     学中文武状元郎。
     小刺刀，大长枪，
     哥哥扛着上战场。
     哥哥、哥哥听我说，
     打垮反动派再回家乡。
    这是鲁南沂南苗家庄孩子诗人苗得雨送他哥哥参军所作的一首诗。他今年十四岁，是鲁中《大众报》工农通讯员。小时因年景不好，父亲逃荒去东北，依靠母亲教养长大。九岁时，上过乐身堂私塾。后来就刻苦勤学。经济上获得翻身以后，学习文化情绪更高，两年间写新闻诗歌达二百余篇。因为是翻身后的农民孩子，又参加当前的各种工作，所以他写出的稿子非常生动，并能紧紧与当前工作结合，为一般农民所欢迎。
    苗家庄解放时，苗得雨才十一岁，就领导组织儿童团，并写了儿童团顺口歌。他家有二亩地，当时他参加变工队，便写了变工队短歌。在土地还家运动时，他又写了十几种翻身大鼓。他那种刻苦自学的精神，尤其令人敬佩。农忙时，常写到深更半夜。有时晚上想好内容，一早起来动手写，他不但自己写，还帮助别人写作。到邻近庄去推动成立报纸通讯组。现在鲁中青联、鲁中大众报社、新华社鲁中分社，联合奖励了他，并且号召全体青救会员、工农通讯员，向他学习，展开广大的工农文化翻身运动。
