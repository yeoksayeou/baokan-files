    [This Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, February 6th] On the 3rd, two regiments and an artillery battalion of the 16th Brigade of the 75th Division of Jiang's troops, reinforcing Boxian, were completely annihilated except for a hundred or so who broke through and escaped. Over a thousand were killed or wounded, over a thousand were captured alive, and eight mountain guns, four anti-tank guns, and many other spoils were seized. These are currently being inventoried.
    [This Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, February 6th] Following the destruction of a Jiang army armored train at the Xiaoba Railway Station on the 3rd, the Eighth Route Army on the Longhai Front destroyed two more Jiang army armored trains at Huanggu Temple (east of Xiaoba) on the 4th. The battle proceeded as follows: On the 3rd, a regiment of Jiang's 45th Division, advancing westward along the railway from Shangqiu, was surrounded by the Eighth Route Army at the Liuhe Railway Station. An armored train rushing from Shangqiu to reinforce them was completely destroyed. The results of this battle were reported previously (see this newspaper on the 6th). On the 4th, the regiment broke out of the encirclement, attempting to escape to Shangqiu, but was surrounded again near the Xiaoba Railway Station. Over a hundred Jiang soldiers were captured, and one heavy machine gun, five light machine guns, and over fifty rifles were seized. On the same day, two more armored trains arrived from Shangqiu as reinforcements, but were completely destroyed at Huanggu Temple. One mountain gun and eighteen carriages were seized, along with many other spoils, which are currently being inventoried.
    [This Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, February 6th] (Delayed) Over a thousand Jiang troops besieged in Yutai ventured out of the city on the 2nd, heading east to attack the old city base. They were intercepted by local troops, who killed over ten enemy soldiers, causing the enemy to immediately flee back into the city.
