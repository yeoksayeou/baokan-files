　　Weekly Comprehensive War Report
    Chiang's Army Faces Extreme Difficulties, Favorable Conditions for Our Army to Annihilate the Enemy Have Been Created
    January 16th to 22nd
    This week, on the battlefields centered around southeastern and southwestern Shandong, Chiang's army found itself striking empty air everywhere, while the People's Liberation Army, with highly skillful mobile warfare, created favorable conditions for annihilating the enemy. Due to the severe economic crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas and the extreme demoralization of the frontline soldiers, Chiang Kai-shek attempted to divert domestic and international attention by attacking Yan'an, and the war in the Guanzhong sub-district has begun. This time, Chiang Kai-shek transferred eleven brigades of troops (with some still in transit) from southern Shaanxi, western Henan, and Lüliang to the southern front of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. On the 18th, they began a five-pronged attack on the Guanzhong sub-district from the east and west. The first-line force consisted of thirteen regiments, approximately 30,000 men, under the overall command of Liu Kan, commander of the 29th Army. Their vanguard troops occupied Malan City, the capital of the Guanzhong sub-district, on the 20th.

    For years, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan have dreamed of capturing Yan'an, deploying troops and generals countless times. On the military maps in their staff offices, the arrows pointing to Yan'an have been drawn countless times. Today, in the midst of crises, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan probably cannot avoid truly taking risks. However, the soldiers and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have long been prepared for self-defense. If Chiang Kai-shek dares to invade rashly, he will surely be punished severely.

    In southern Shandong, Chiang's army deployed over 200,000 troops densely along a broad front of over a hundred li, advancing step by step and abreast. The People's Liberation Army deliberately withdrew from Linyi on the 15th, and Chiang's army temporarily gained an empty city. In reality, Bai Chongxi had already admitted that "capturing Linyi can only boost the morale of the troops." Chen Cheng and Xue Yue also said to Hao Pengju, "Even if we occupy Linyi, it will not solve the problem."

    General Liu Bocheng's troops, with their large-scale advances and retreats, opened up a new liberated area in Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu across the Longhai Railway, and then retreated in large strides, leaving the Chiang army on this line completely in a passive position. The main force of Chiang's army, including the 5th Army, was passively driven from southwestern Shandong to northern Henan, southern Hebei, the Pinghan Railway, and then the Longhai Railway, making a large circle and becoming a tired force. After being unable to pass through to reinforce southern Shandong, they once again scurried to southwestern Shandong, successively occupying Shanxian, Cao County, and Dingtao. This area is precisely the Chiang army's graveyard, where Chiang's puppet troops under Zhang Lanfeng, Mi Wenhe, and Liu Ruzhen suffered disastrous defeats and annihilation not long ago.

    The 21st Division of the 60th Army of Chiang's army, entrenched in Jinchuan and Liuhe counties of Andong Province in the Northeast, launched a third offensive against the Linjiang area on the 16th. On the 17th, it was intercepted by the Democratic Allied Army at Tonggou, thirty li south of Jinchuan. Its 63rd Regiment and most of the division's directly subordinate artillery battalion were annihilated, with 300 killed and wounded. The regimental commander, three infantry battalion commanders, one artillery battalion commander, and 1,300 others were captured. The offensive has come to a standstill.

    This week's reports show that Chiang Kai-shek's offensive "is facing extreme difficulties." Therefore, the Chiang's Ministry of National Defense, which had announced that it would no longer publish war reports, was flustered and repeatedly spread rumors in order to "cover up defeats and divert attention," attempting to confuse people and stabilize the interior.

　　一周综合战报
    蒋军进攻面对极端困难我军有利歼敌条件已成
    一月十六日至二十二日
    本周内，以鲁东南与鲁西南为中心之战场上，蒋军到处扑空，而人民解放军则以高度机巧之运动战，创造了有利歼敌条件。由于蒋管区严重之经济危机，与前线士气之十分颓丧，蒋介石乃企图以进攻延安来转移国内外的视线，关中分区战争已揭开了序幕。这次蒋介石自陕南、豫西、吕梁各地调结十一个旅兵力（尚有部分在运动中）至陕甘宁边区南线，十八日开始自东西两线分五路进攻关中分区。第一线兵力共十三个团，约三万人，由二十九军军长刘戡担任总指挥，其先头部队于二十日侵占关中分区首府马栏市。
    蒋介石、胡宗南几年来总是梦想着攻下延安，调兵遣将也不知道有多少次，他们参谋室的军用地图上，指向延安的箭头不知已指过多少回了。蒋介石、胡宗南在危机四伏的今天，这些大概不能不真正冒险了。然而，陕甘宁边区军民很早就有着自卫准备，蒋介石胆敢冒然进犯，定将遭到断腰折骨的惩罚。
    鲁南蒋军在百余里宽阔的战线上密集二十余万兵力，步步为营，齐头并进。人民解放军于十五日有计划撤离临沂，蒋军暂时得了一座空城，其实白崇禧早已自认“打下临沂，只能给部队打打气。”陈诚、薛岳、也向郝鹏举说：“就是占领临沂，也不能解决问题。”
    大踏步进退的刘伯承将军所部，在横跨陇海路开辟了豫皖苏新解放区后，又大踏步后退，使这一线的蒋军完全陷入被动。蒋军主力第五军等部，被动的从鲁西南而豫北、冀南，而平汉路，而陇海路，兜了个大圈子，已成疲惫之师，在增援鲁南无法通过后，又复窜扰鲁西南，先后侵占单、曹、定陶等地，而这个地区正是不久前蒋伪军张岚峰、米文和、刘汝珍等部惨遭覆没，遭受歼灭性打击的蒋军坟场。
    在东北盘踞安东省金川、柳河等地的蒋军六十军暂廿一师，十六日开始向临江地区发动第三次进攻，十七日在金川南三十里通沟遭民主联军阻击，其六十三团全部及该师直属炮兵营大部就歼，死伤三百人，团长和三名步兵营长，一名炮兵营长以下一千三百人全被俘虏，攻势已呈停滞状态。
    这一周的日报，显示蒋介石的进攻“正面对着极端的困难”，因此曾经宣布再不发表战报的蒋记国防部，为了“掩饰败绩，转移视线”，又慌得一再散布谣言，企图炫惑人心，稳定内部。（新华社延安二十三日电）
