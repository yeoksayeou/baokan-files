　　Left Right Convenes Correspondence Work Conference
    Land Reform Movement Reporting Greatly Improved. County Secretary and County Head Take the Lead in Regularly Writing for Party Newspapers.
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan News] On the evening of the 14th of this month, Comrade Wang Yaodong, Minister of Propaganda of the Zuoquan County Party Committee, took advantage of the opportunity for county and district cadres to come to the county to summarize the mass movement and convened a correspondence work conference. Comrade Wang said: "During the fifty days of the land reform movement, the number of correspondents in the county increased from more than ten to more than seventy, writing more than 300 articles for the county mimeographed newspaper. In the past eight or nine days, the People's Daily has continued to publish five articles, making the correspondence work change from inactive to active - this is the glory of our correspondents and also shows the progress of our correspondence work." In order to improve writing skills, several typical articles from the mass movement were selected and read aloud and discussed on the spot. It was unanimously agreed that the county's "How the Manger Mobilized Backward Masses," published in this newspaper on the 3rd, was more successful. It was reviewed that the general common problems in past writing were: untimely reporting; not good at writing small articles (referring to length), writing more prominent and typical materials (referring to content); loving to write large and monotonous articles, and not loving to write small articles with guiding significance. It is required that everyone study "Correspondence Work" etc. to overcome the above shortcomings. The Deputy County Head reflected that he wrote the least in the past because it was "difficult" and he was "lazy." In the future, he will definitely write two articles per month. Comrade Zhai Ying, Secretary of the County Party Committee, called on county and district cadres to write articles for the People's Daily and the Taihang Xinhua Daily. And pointed out: (1) Be bold and dare to write; (2) Be truthful, write what you do; (3) Don't be afraid of trouble, review it twice after writing it well. At that time, twenty-one county-level cadres (including the County Head and County Secretary) and eighteen district cadres and below (including the District Head and Branch Committee members) registered to regularly write for this newspaper in the future.

　　左权召开通讯工作会议
    土地改革运动中报导有极大进步县书县长带头将经常为党报写稿
    【本报左权讯】本月十四日晚左权县委宣传部长王耀东同志就全县区干部到县总结群运之便。召开通讯工作会议。王同志说：“在五十天土地改革运动中，全县通讯员由十多名增至七十余名，给县油印报写稿三百余件；近八、九天内，人民日报继续刊登五篇，使通讯工作由消沉走上活跃——这是我们通讯员的光荣同时也表现了我们通讯工作的进步。”为提高写稿技术，检出群运中几篇较典型稿子当场朗读、讨论，一致认为本报三日发表之该县“马厩是如何发动落后群众的”较成功。检讨出过去写稿一般共犯毛病：报导不及时；不善于写小型稿（指篇幅）写出较突出较典型的材料（指内容）；爱写大的而又千篇一律的稿子，不爱写小的富于指导意义的稿子。要求大家多学习“通讯工作”等，以克复上述缺点。正副县长反省他过去写稿最少是由于“难”、“懒”，今后一定每月写稿两篇。县委书记翟英同志号召县、区干部都给人民日报及太行新华日报写稿。并指出：（一）大胆，敢写；（二）真实，作啥写啥；（三）不怕麻烦，写好后重看两遍。当有县级干部二十一人（包括县长、县书），区干部以下十八人（包括区长、分委）十八名报名今后经常给本报写稿。
