    【Report from Tuntliu】After the leadership of Dongjie, Chengguan County, put forward the slogan of "filling in the gaps and leveling differences, turning over every family," cadres, the masses, and military families greatly promoted the spirit of mutual concession and mutual assistance to respond to this call. At the beginning of the month, the masses repeatedly discussed the method of distributing the fruits in groups, and finally used the method of comparison to determine the number of shares for each household, which was posted on the list. Subsequently, the fruits were distributed. Li Fulin, vice chairman of the Farmers' Association, said to the masses: "I am alone and have no burden. Forty-five shares are too many. I want to reduce four shares to help the military families turn over." Zhang Jianhua, a retired soldier, interrupted him before he finished speaking, saying, "That won't work. You are over sixty years old and have no labor force. How can you live on too few shares?" But Li Fulin insisted on doing so, and everyone could not refuse, so they had to allow him to reduce two shares. Then Sun Fuyuan, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, asked to reduce ten shares, and Pang Yuanlin, the group leader, asked to reduce ten shares. Everyone knew that this was all sincere, so they had to agree and decided to add the reduced shares to the families of poor military dependents Pang Dongke and Li Xinfang. Based on this spirit of mutual concession and mutual assistance, the fruits were fairly and reasonably distributed, and the filling and leveling were thoroughly completed. In particular, the relationship between the masses and the cadres became better and more united. Old Chen, who was in his fifties, said: "When Yan Xishan ruled us, the people in the village who handled affairs were the masters of the village. Hard work was assigned to the common people, but they got rich. Since the Eighth Route Army came and Chairman Mao led us well, the cadres who handled affairs were so busy day and night that they didn't look like human beings. The share of fruits is even less than that of the masses. Compared with Yan Xishan, isn't this a world of difference!"
    【Taoyue Report, 6th】Wangwu County has completed land reform. Wangwu began filling in the gaps and leveling differences from December 15th of last winter to January 15th. In this process, 2,250 peasant households who had not previously received land were allocated two to three mu per person, and 85% of them rose to the level of middle peasants. The smooth progress of land reform in the county was due to breaking down the following two obstacles: (1) Eliminating the estrangement between cadres and the masses. In the past struggles, cadres and activists had caused dissatisfaction among the masses because they had obtained more fruits, and the cadres also believed that the masses were backward and deliberately opposed them. Cadres in Nanman Village mobilized poor peasants to join the militia, and they said: "You are soldiers to defend your land, what about us?" Therefore, when the filling and leveling began, the disputes between cadres and the masses were first mediated, and cadres were called upon to conduct self-criticism. After reflection, many cadres apologized to the masses and returned the excess fruits to the farmers with less land. (2) Unite and win over the middle peasants. During the anti-traitor and anti-hegemon movement last spring, due to a confused understanding of the middle peasants, many places damaged the interests of the middle peasants, and some middle peasants thought that "bachelors don't suffer immediate losses," so they simply offered their land first. After the leadership discovered this, they immediately tried to correct the situation of middle peasants offering land, and educated the peasants ideologically to unite with the middle peasants, so that the focus of the movement was aimed at the landlords.

    屯留东街干部为了大家翻身
    自动减低果实份数
    王屋干部退出多分果实
    发扬互让互助彻底完成填补
    全县顺利完成土地改革
    【本报屯留讯】本县城关东街在领导上提出填平补齐、家家翻身的口号后，干部、群众与军属都大大发扬互让互助精神来响应这一号召。在月初由群众分组反复讨论分配果实的办法，最后用了比一比的办法决定了各户份数，挂榜公布。随后进行分配果实，农会副主席李福林对群众说：“我是独一个人，没有累赘，四十五份太多，我要减四份帮助军属翻身。”荣退军人张建华不等他说完就抢着说：“那不行，你六十多岁了，没有劳动力，份数太少你怎么过活呢？”但李福林执意要这样，大家推让不过，只得允许他减两份。接着农会常委孙富元要求减十份，小组长庞元林要求减十份。大家知道这都是诚心诚意的，只好照着应承下，并商定把减下来的份数给贫苦军属庞东科家、李新房家加上。基于这种互让互助的精神，果实得到公平合理的分配，彻底完成了填平补齐，尤其群众与干部的关系越发良好，团结得越发紧密。五十多岁的老陈说：“阎锡山统治咱的时候，村里办公的就是村里的老爷，苦差事轮着老百姓，发财可轮着他们。自从八路军来了，毛主席领导的好，办公事的干部们白天黑夜忙碌得不像人样，分果实反比不上群众多。这和阎锡山比不是差到天上地下！”
    【本报太岳六日电】王屋全县完成土地改革。王屋自去冬十二月十五日开始至元月十五日经过填平补齐，过去未有分得土地的二千二百五十户农民，此次每人分得二亩至三亩，且有百分之八十五上升为中农。该县土地改革得以顺利进展，是因为打破了如下两个障碍：（一）消除了干部与群众间的隔阂。过去斗争中干部与积极分子曾因多得果实引起群众的不满，干部亦认为群众落后故意和他作对。南满村干部动员贫农参加民兵，他们说：“你们当民兵是为了保卫自己的土地，我们为甚呢？”因此填平补齐开始时，首先调解干部与群众间的纠纷，号召干部作自我检查，不少干部经过反省后向群众认错，并把多得的果实退出分给少地的农民。（二）团结与争取了中农。去春反奸霸运动中，因对中农认识糊涂，不少地方损害了中农利益，有的中农则认为“光棍不吃眼下亏”，索性先把田献出来。领导发现后，立即设法纠正中农献田，并从思想上教育农民团结中农，才使运动锋芒对准地主。
