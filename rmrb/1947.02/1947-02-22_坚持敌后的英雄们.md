Heroes Persisting Behind Enemy Lines

    The Eighth Route Army Is Still By Our Side

    Comrade Yang Rulian, head of the Second District of Linze, bravely avenged the masses, disregarding his own safety. After the landlord Zhang Dengling, who had fled from Dazhangji, returned home with the Chiang troops, he oppressed the masses, demanding tenfold repayments, reversing the fruits of struggle, and hunting down our activists and farmer association members everywhere. Shi Hongxiang was beaten half to death and buried alive. At night, the masses flocked to our cadres to complain and demand revenge. Comrade Yang, the district head, resolutely took on the task given to him by the masses. He vowed not to be the district head if he did not kill the tyrant Zhang Dengling. One night, he led two messengers, disguised with the insignia of the enemy’s Mudan Detachment, to Dazhangji. When he arrived at Zhang Dengling’s door, District Head Yang knocked and said, "I am from the Mudan Detachment, open the door." Zhang Dengling thought it was a "central guest" and quickly came out to open the door. But as soon as he opened the door, a pistol was pointed at his chest. He turned and ran, hiding in the house. District Head Yang used a flashlight to chase him in, dragging him out from under the bed like a rat. He trembled and said, "Who…who are you, grandpa, please spare me!" District Head Yang shot him in the head. At this time, the enemy heard the gunfire and chased after them, but District Head Yang safely led the messengers back. After Zhang Dengling was killed, the landlords in the Dazhangji area were suppressed, and the masses said, "The Eighth Route Army is still by our side."

    Alert and Decisive Wang Dengshan

    Comrade Wang Dengshan is the fifth squadron leader of a certain militia work team in Huxi. He always led the way in every battle. Once, he was walking through Zuxingji alone to reconnoiter the enemy's situation when he saw the enemy's telephone line lying on the ground. He wanted to cut the line, but since he had no knife, he had to grab it with both hands and kick it with his feet. After the wire broke, the poles on both sides of the wire made a "crashing" sound. This was noticed by the enemy sentry, who quickly asked him, "What are you doing?" He said without hesitation, "The wire is broken, I'm here to fix it for you." The enemy was fooled.

    Learn from Comrades Yang and Hao

    When the Chiang troops occupied Qingfeng, Comrades Yang Jinzue, the organization committee member of the First District, and Hao Yanzong of the Armed Forces Committee, completed the Party's tasks and persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines. The Qingfeng County Committee issued a special commendation and called on the cadres in the guerrilla area to "learn from them." When the enemy entered the First District, Comrade Yang was driven out by the enemy because he did not immediately gather the militia. However, that same night he turned back and led the masses in a legitimate struggle against the enemy, and went to various villages to check on the work left behind, persisting until the end when he grasped the democratic power. Comrade Hao Tingzong of the Second District proposed to his superiors that he wanted to organize armed forces to fight the enemy when the enemy arrived in Qingfeng. After the superiors decided to appoint him as the instructor of the district team, he quickly organized fifty militiamen. In the past month, he led the team to cooperate with the troops in battle, personally leading every battle, acting as both instructor and fighter, playing a leading role among the team members.

　　坚持敌后的英雄们
    八路军还在我们身边
    临泽二区区长杨汝连同志，不顾自身危险，勇敢为群众复仇。大张集逃回地主张登领随着蒋军回家后，欺压群众，以一还十，倒回斗争果实，并到处捕杀我积极分子农会员，石洪祥被打半死后活埋，群众夜里纷纷找我干部诉苦，要求复仇。我该区杨区长坚决负担起群众所给他的任务，他发誓不杀掉恶霸张登领不当区长。一夜他领着两个通讯员，化装敌人木丹支队的番号，到大张集去了。到了张登领门口，杨区长敲门说：“我是木丹支队的，开门吧。”张登领以为是“中央客”，赶快出来开门，那知一开门手枪就对着他的胸口，于是转身就奔，躲到屋里，杨区长用手电筒照着追进去，从床底下把他象老鼠一样拖出来，他打抖着说：“您是……谁，大爷请饶饶吧！”杨区长一枪就把他的头开了花，这时敌人闻着枪声追来，但杨区长率着通讯员早安全跑回来了。张登领被打死之后，大张集一带的地主都被镇压下来，群众说：“八路军还在我们身边呢。”
    机警果敢的王登山
    王登山同志是湖西某武工队五分队长，每次战斗他都走在前面。一次他一个人走经组兴集侦察敌情，看见敌人电话线拉在地上，他想把线弄断，但因无刀子，只得用两手扎上用脚一登，电线断后，两边架线的杆子“哗啦”的响起来，这是敌人哨兵发觉了，赶快问他：“你是干什么的”。他毫不犹豫的说：“电线断了，我是给你接上呀。”敌人被骗过去了。
    向杨郝两同志看齐
    蒋军进占清丰时，一区组织委员杨金学和武委会郝延宗两同志完成了党的任务，坚持在敌后斗争。清丰县委会特通令表扬，并号召游击区的干部“要向他们看齐。”敌人进占一区时，杨同志因没马上把民兵集合起来，即被敌人赶出来，但当天晚上他又转回去，领导着群众与敌人做合法的斗争，并且到各村检查留下来的工作，一直坚持到最后掌握了民主政权。二区郝廷宗同志在敌人到清丰时，他就向上级提出要组织武装，与敌人拚，上级决定他任区队指导员后，他很快的组织了五十民兵。一个月来他率队配合部队战斗，每次战斗都是亲自带领，又是指导员，又是战斗员，在队员中起了带头作用。
