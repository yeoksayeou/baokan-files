Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: "The Kuomintang army harms the people, patrolling the streets recklessly. Doors and windows are taken away, and then they come to rape!" This is a folk song of the people of Boshan Village along the Jiaoji Railway about the behavior of the Kuomintang army. Of the 650 textile machines originally in the town's textile industry, only a little over 200 remain. More than half of the 5,000 households in the city no longer have looms. In Shantou Village, Boshan alone, more than 120 people have been drafted as soldiers in the first round, and 90 in the second round, with more being captured. The two businesses in the city have been severely exploited with more than 30 kinds of taxes. Recently, there are even more "house donations": 20,000 yuan in legal tender for each tile-roofed house, and 5,000 yuan for each thatched house, plus head taxes, citizen registration taxes, marriage, and birth donations... The people's burden reaches four-fifths of their income, which is twice as high as during the enemy-puppet period. In January of this year, this provoked a demonstration of more than 400 merchants and residents to resist. Xu Zhenzhong, the Kuomintang county magistrate of Linzi, beat over ten village chiefs near Xindian because they could not pay enough. In Zhu Jia, a small village of fewer than 50 households, more than 20 farmers were beaten. In one instance, the grain requisitioned was equivalent to 171 catties of wheat, 55 catties of millet, 23 catties of soybeans, 15 catties of sorghum, 100 catties of firewood, and 90,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency for every tael of silver. Farmers are unable to pay and have risen up in resistance. In Zichuan alone, the number of people resisting injustice and participating in popular uprisings has reached several hundred.

　　胶济沿线蒋军占领区
    民不聊生群起抗蒋
    【新华社山东二十三日电】“国军害民、沿街胡巡，门窗搬净，又来奸淫！”这是胶济线的博山村人民对蒋军行为的一首歌谣。该镇纺织业原有布机六百五十台，现只剩二百余台，全市五千户人家半数以上没有织布机，博山山头村一地被抓壮丁达一百二十余名，第二期九十名，正在抓捕中。城内两家则遭严重压榨，名目达三十余种之多，最近更多的“房屋捐”，瓦屋每间法币二万元，草屋五千元，人头捐、公民登记税、婚姻、生育捐………。人民负担达其收入的五分之四，较敌伪时期尚有增倍。今年一月间又引起四百余商民示威反抗。临淄蒋记县长徐振中因无力缴纳不足毒打辛店附近十余村村长，农民挨打者仅朱家不足五十户之小村即有二十余人，一次被征粮款每两银折合物麦子一百七十一斤，小米五十五斤，豆子二十三斤，高粱十五斤，柴一百斤，蒋币九万元。农民无力缴纳，群起反抗，仅淄川一地抗了抗义之民变已达数百人。
