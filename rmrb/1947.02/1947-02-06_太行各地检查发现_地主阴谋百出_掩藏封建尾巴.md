    Taihang Area Inspections Reveal
    Landlords' Numerous Conspiracies
    Concealing Feudal Remnants
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Reports from multiple correspondents: In-depth inspections in the Taihang HeShun Changzhi old and new areas have revealed that feudal rulers are using various cunning and conspiratorial means to conceal their feudal remnants and stubbornly resist the masses' liquidation. (1) Qu BoSheng, a landlord from Qujia Mountain in Changzhi's third district, attempted to avoid thorough liquidation by feigning enlightenment and donating 34 silver dollars and 600 strings of copper coins. The masses thought that after three liquidations, Qu had nothing left to hide. However, after inspection, it was found that Qu was still hiding 14 silver ingots and 23 silver dollars. Guo MiGu, a landlord from Gaoqiu, HeShun, donated some bad land to pretend to be enlightened, but in reality, he retained a large amount of property gained from the blood and sweat of the peasants. Jing QiSheng's wife, the landlord from Beizhang Village, Changzhi, pretended to be poor and begged for food. However, 248,000 silver dollars and a large amount of scattered and hidden materials were taken out during the struggle. (2) They attempted to use small favors or "honey traps" to buy off cadres and protect their property. Du JinLin, a landlord from Canxing Village, HeShun, lent 1,000 yuan and a cow to a cadre on credit. Chen BaoZe, a landlord from Changzhi, used the same method to win over the political director Chen ××, lending him 1,000 yuan to join the cooperative. A landlord from Hebei Village in the second district of HeShun used his daughter to "make peace" with a village cadre, also saying that a son-in-law is half a son, keeping 20 acres of good land. Qu DongGou, a landlord from Qujia Mountain, used his own daughter to win over militiamen, and then tried to win over the children of the Farmers' Association director, provoking disputes between the Farmers' Association and the militia. Most shamelessly, a landlord from Chenjia Village, HeShun, used his own woman to soften the village chief to shield the struggle. (3) They used honest peasants to disperse and preserve their property. Wang QiuGen, a landlord from Huihe, Changzhi, gave 50 silver dollars to Li QiYun, an honest peasant, saying, "Even if you are beaten to death during the struggle, don't say anything." The landlord of Zhonghe and his concubine hid many things outside, threatening the peasants, "If you talk, you will be punished the same as me." Chen SiZe, a landlord from Nanhe, gave Wang YuanHu, a poor peasant, a few pieces of ragged clothes to prevent him from raising any opinions. In addition, they used clan relationships to create sectarian opposition, used fake family divisions to cover up their class status, and pretended to be progressive to seize political power, etc., attempting to undermine the masses' efforts to turn the tables and prepare to counterattack at any opportunity. Although the above examples have been crushed by the masses, their cunning conspiracies deserve utmost vigilance. (Cheng Quan, Guo Zhen)

    太行各地检查发现
    地主阴谋百出
    掩藏封建尾巴
    【本报特讯】综合通讯员报导：太行和顺长治新老地区深入检查中，发现封建统治者运用各种奸滑阴谋手段，掩护其封建尾巴，顽强的抵抗群众清算。（一）长治三区屈家山地主屈柏盛，以假开明方式献洋三十四元，铜钱六百串，逃避彻底清算，群众以为屈某经过三次清算没啥内货，但经过检查，屈某仍掩藏元宝十四个现洋二十三元。和顺高邱地主郭觅固，献出一点坏地装开明，实则保留农民大批血汗财产。长治北漳村地主景其盛妻装穷要饭，但从斗争中却拿出二十四万八千现洋，及分散隐藏物资甚多。（二）企图以小恩小惠或“美人计”收买干部保藏财产。和顺蚕兴村地主杜金林以一千元一头牛赊给干部，长治地主陈保则，以同样方法拉拢政治主任陈××，借给他一千元入合作社。和顺二区河北村地主用闺女与村干“和亲”，还说女婿顶半个儿，给保留二十亩好地。屈家山地主屈东狗用自己女儿拉拢民兵，又去拉拢农会主任的孩子，挑拨农会与民兵纠纷，最无耻的是和顺陈家庄地主用自己女人去软化村长包庇斗争。（三）。利用老实农民分散保存财物。长治辉河地主王秋根将现洋五十元交给老实农民李起运，说“到斗争时打死你也不要说”。中和地主和他的小老婆在外寄藏很多东西，威胁农民“你谈了和我同罪。”南和地主陈四则给贫农王元虎小孩几件破衣服，不让他提意见。此外或利用家族关系制造宗派对立，利用假分家来掩盖成份，伪装进步面貌掌握政权等等手段，企图破坏群众翻身准备伺机反攻，以上事例虽遭群众粉碎，但其狡猾阴谋值得万分警惕。（成泉、国珍）
