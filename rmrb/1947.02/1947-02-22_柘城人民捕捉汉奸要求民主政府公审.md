　　[This dispatch from the Longhai Front, 20th] When the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhecheng, the notorious traitor Zhang Yingchen (nicknamed Zhang Taiye, who was the head of the Zhecheng puppet security regiment when the Japanese devils were present) was captured by the local people and handed over to the Eighth Route Army. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, this criminal relied on the power of the Japanese invaders to extort money from the local people, using the extorted money to buy more than 40 hectares of land. Those farmers who resisted or refused to be extorted were killed. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhang Yingchen personally killed several innocent people. Relying on the protection of his traitorous armed forces, he sat firmly in Zhecheng. Any woman with good looks, once he took a fancy to her, could never escape his rape. His sixth concubine was a respectable girl seized in Zhecheng. After Zhang was arrested, the people within 20 li around the city were greatly delighted. The families of the victims have filed complaints with the democratic government, demanding a public trial and the return of the extorted land and houses. An old lady in the city burned an extra stick of incense while praying, kneeling on the ground to pray: May Mao Zedong and Zhu De's troops always win victories!

　　柘城人民捕捉汉奸要求民主政府公审
    【本报陇海前线二十日电】陇海路南八路军于解放柘城时，著名汉奸张应臣（外号张太爷，日寇在时，是柘城伪保安团长）。被当地人民捕获，送交八路军。该犯在抗战八年中，依靠日寇势力，敲诈当地老百姓，把敲诈来的钱买了四十多顷地。对于稍事反抗或不听其讹诈的农民，即行杀戮，张应臣在抗日战争期间，还亲手杀了数名无辜老百姓。他依仗汉奸的武装保护，稳坐在柘城内，凡是有姿色的妇女，一经他看上，就再也难逃他的奸淫。他的第六个姨太太，就是在柘城城内霸占的良家闺女。张逆被捕后，城周二十里以内的民众，莫不大大称快。被害的家属纷纷向民主政府控诉，要求开大会公审，并倒出被讹诈的土地房屋。城内有个老太太烧香时多烧了一炷，跪在地上祷祝：让毛泽东朱德的队伍永远打胜仗！
