　　He Shun's emancipated peasants
    Review their arms and prepare to join the war
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 22nd] On the 8th of this month, the emancipated peasants of He Shun reviewed their own strength and prepared to join the war. A total of more than 7,900 people participated in the militia self-defense team, which lasted for three days. After the universal hard training and self-study last winter, the farmers in the county have greatly improved their skills. The inspection items are divided into: shooting, grenade throwing, bayonet practice, landmine laying, combat drills, political tests, and stretcher carrying, etc. On that day, after the deafening sound of artillery, the militiamen, carrying rifles with gleaming bayonets, marched into the arena in formation amidst the majestic sound of bugles. The audience was a sea of people. An old man surnamed Zhang, who had lost some teeth, said with joy, "Good! The landlords say the situation is changing, those bastards don't want to live anymore." During the shooting competition, Liu Chenghe, a militiaman from Bairen Village in the Third District, scored 19 rings out of three shots. Except for a very few, most of the militiamen who participated in the shooting were able to hit the target. Among the 130 people who participated in the grenade throwing, most were able to throw over 30 meters. The militiamen in the Third District buried landmines quickly and were not easily discovered, and more than a dozen new landmine laying methods were created. According to the comrade in charge of the county, "After the emancipation of the peasants in the county, their class consciousness has been raised, and the results of martial arts training last winter have made a leap forward compared with previous years."
