    Significant Development Achieved in the Border Region Economy and Various Constructions Over the Past Year

    Chairman Yang presented a summary report on the border region's construction over the past year, as follows: In terms of economic construction, the principles of organization in agriculture, handicrafts, and sideline occupations have been implemented, surpassing any previous year. Taihang achieved the greatest results, with 840,000 people organized in 20 counties, accounting for 78% of the total labor force, and women and children accounting for 57%. In Jize County, Hebei Province, 67% of the total labor force was organized. At the same time, attention was paid to improving varieties and combining agricultural and sideline occupations, with many places achieving a "cultivate three, surplus one" level, such as in Pingshun, Wuxiang, and Licheng in Taihang. In terms of industry, privately-owned and jointly-owned public-private partnerships were adopted. In the past year (before the Self-Defense War), the coal mines in Liuhegou, Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, and Shigijie have recovered to pre-war levels. The machine kilns in Jincheng, Gaoping, and Yangcheng have increased from four before the war to nine, and with the addition of small kilns, the output has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. In the iron industry, 462 furnaces have been restored in the above three counties. The Pengcheng porcelain industry, famous in North China, has restored 54 kilns. The export value of the Xingtai fur industry reached over 75 million yuan in ten months. Highways are open, and commerce is thriving, with more than 2,500 merchants and peddlers added in Handan.
    At this point, Chairman Yang emphasized: Regarding the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course and repairing the dikes, Chiang Kai-shek has broken his promise and destroyed the agreement, delaying the payment of construction funds and relief funds. However, all our compatriots and administrative personnel in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces have overcome difficulties and used 2.33 million workers to repair 1,462 li of dikes. Recently, Chiang and the US have violated the agreement and released water. Our compatriots in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces are fighting against both Chiang Kai-shek's "human army" and "water army" while rushing to rescue and provide relief to the disaster victims and relocate people. This is a joint conspiracy between Chiang and the US, related to the lives and property of millions of people, and is a major issue of common concern for the entire border region. We must fight together with our compatriots in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Hebei's achievements in river management last year were also significant, with four new rivers dug, ten old rivers dredged, totaling more than 100,000 zhang in length, and about 150,000 zhang of canals opened, with a total of more than 16 million workers used. This can reduce the flooded area by 4.8 million mu, a huge achievement worthy of reward.
    Furthermore, 270,000,000 yuan was reduced or exempted from the people's burden. After Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive, we supported the Self-Defense War by tightening our belts and reducing unnecessary expenses, without increasing the people's direct burden. Our financial policy is that banks serve production. Last year, the total amount of various loans was 350,000,000 yuan. We reward and support private banks. Some banks in the Chiang-controlled areas have moved to our area, such as the Yuxing Bank of Taigu.
    In terms of education, Northern University was established last year, with more than 1,400 faculty and students. There are 65 secondary schools, three times the number before the victory of the counter-offensive. Senior primary schools increased from 360 to 793, an increase of 120%, and the number of students increased by 77%. Junior primary schools increased from 17,752 to 43,510, an increase of 145%, and the enrollment rate of children in school is as high as 86% in Hebei Province.
    In terms of disaster relief, the government spent more than 15 million jin of millet and more than 500 million yuan last year. The UNRRA relief supplies we received to date are only over 20.4 million tons, equivalent to 2/1000 of the goods shipped to China last year. According to the proportion of disasters in our region since the Anti-Japanese War and the needs of the whole country, we should have received 90/1000. This unfair and unreasonable situation is due to the corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, who embezzles relief supplies and uses them to attack the liberated areas. We have been striving to deal directly with UNRRA in the hope of improving the situation.
    Chairman Yang then immediately emphasized and clearly stated that the main task at present is only one: everything is to defeat the invader Chiang Kai-shek, everything is subordinate to the war, everything serves the war, and all work is for the needs of the war. To this end, first, we should put supporting the front line and ensuring war supplies in the first place of our work. We should advocate production and thrift, tighten our belts, and share weal and woe. We should do a good job in supporting the army, giving preferential treatment to military families, and resettling the families of martyrs and veterans. Second, we should carry out a large-scale production campaign, paying special attention to the combination of war and production, the combination of labor and military affairs, promoting scientific and technological accounting, saving manpower, and further focusing on agriculture, industry, and sideline occupations to produce wealth. In order to develop production, we must vigorously support farmers and quickly complete land reform. The central area must be completed before spring plowing, and the border area should strive to complete it before the summer harvest. In areas temporarily occupied by the Chiang army, we should combine guerrilla warfare and counter-liquidation struggles to implement land reform. Third, in order to meet the demands of the emancipated peasants, we should focus on ideological education that liberation should be thorough both physically and mentally.
    After Chairman Yang's report, he proposed a motion to oppose Chiang and the US's commercial activities, oppose the bogus constitution, and designate November 4 as National Humiliation Memorial Day. It was 3 p.m., and the chairman announced that the group would discuss the report and the proposals of the committee members tomorrow, and adjourned the meeting.

    边区经济及各种建设
    一年来获得重大发展
    关于一年来边区建设，杨主席概括报告如下：经济建设方面，农业、手工业、副业实行了组织起来的方针，去年超过以往任何一年。太行成绩最大，二十个县组织八十四万人，占全劳力的百分之七十八，妇女儿童占百分之五十七。冀南鸡泽一县，组织全劳力的百分之六十七。同时，注意改良品种，农副业结合，不少地方达到耕三余一，如太行平顺、武乡、黎城。工业方面，采取民营、公私合营方式，一年来（自卫战争前）六河沟、峰峰、焦作、石圪节煤矿，已恢复战前水平。晋城、高平、阳城机器窑由战前四座增到九座，加上小窑，产量超过战前一倍以上。铁业，以上三县恢复四六二座。闻名华北的彭城磁业，恢复五十四个窑。邢台皮毛业，十个月出口总值达七五○○余万元。公路通行，商业繁荣，邯郸坐商摊贩增至二五○○余座以外。
    至此，杨主席着重指出：关于黄河归故与修堤问题，蒋介石背信弃义，破坏协定，延付工款救济费，而我冀鲁豫全体同胞及行政人员，克服困难，用工二百三十三万，修复大堤一千四百六十二华里。最近蒋美违约放水，我冀鲁豫同胞正在抢险救灾移民救济，与蒋介石的“人军”与“水军”同时搏斗。这是蒋美的共同阴谋，是数百万人民生命财产所系，是全边区休戚相关的大问题，我们要偕同冀鲁豫同胞一起奋斗。冀南去年治河成绩也是很大的，挖新河四道，浚旧河十道，共长十万多丈，开渠约十五万丈，总计用工达一千六百多万，可减少水淹面积四百八十万亩，成绩巨大，值得奖励。
    并减免人民负担二十七万万元，蒋介石大举进攻后，我们以节衣缩食，紧缩不必要的开支等方法支持自卫战争，未增加人民直接负担。我们的金融政策是银行服务生产，去年一年各种贷款总计三十五万万元。奖励扶植私人银号，蒋管区银号有搬来我区者，如太谷之裕兴银号等。
    教育方面，去年设立北方大学，员生千四百余人。中等学校六十五处，为反攻胜利前之三倍。高级小学由三百六十到七百九十三处，增加百分之一百二十，学生增加百分之七十七。初级小学，由一万七千七百五十二处到四万三千五百一十处，增加百分之一百四十五，入学儿童如冀南占学龄儿童百分之八十六多。
    在救济灾荒方面，上年度政府支出小米在千五百万斤以上，款五万万余元。我们得到的联总救济物资，截至目前只二千四万余吨，相当去年运华物资的千分之二。按照本区抗战以来灾情与全国需要比率说，我们应得千分之九十。这样不公平不合理，是由于蒋介石反动集团贪污中饱，利用救济物资进攻解放区。我们曾争取与联总直接交道，以期情况有所改进。
    杨主席继即强调提出并切实说明当前的主要任务只有一个：一切为了打败进犯者蒋介石，一切服从战争，一切服务于战争，一切工作为着战争的需要。为此，第一、我们应把支援前线，保证战争供给放在工作的第一位。提倡生产节约，节衣缩食，甘苦与共。把拥军优军安置烈属及荣退军人工作做好。第二、开展大生产运动，特别注意战争与生产结合，劳武结合，推进科计学算，节省民力，进一步着重农工副业，生产财富。为着发展生产，必须大力支援农民，迅速完成土地改革，中心区春耕前一定完成，边沿区争取夏收完成，蒋军暂时占领区结合开展游击战争，反倒算斗争，贯彻土地改革。第三、适应翻身农民要求，着重进行翻透身也要翻透心的思想教育。
    杨主席报告毕，提出反对蒋美商的反对伪宪，规定十一月四日为国耻纪念日的提案。时已下午三点，主席宣布明日小组讨论报告及各委员之提案，休会。
