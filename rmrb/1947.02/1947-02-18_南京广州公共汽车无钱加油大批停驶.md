　　Nanjing and Guangzhou Public Buses
    Stop Running En Masse Due to Lack of Funds for Fuel

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] According to Associated Press and Central News Agency reports: A large number of public buses in Nanjing and Guangzhou have stopped running due to soaring prices. As of the 10th, less than one-third of the buses continued to operate in Guangzhou, and further shutdowns are expected. Ninety private bus companies have ceased operations, all due to skyrocketing gasoline prices and severe losses, leading to widespread complaints from vehicle owners and passengers. Simultaneously, long lines of gasoline tankers and freight trucks in Nanjing have also stopped operating due to fuel shortages.

　　南京广州公共汽车
    无钱加油大批停驶
    【新华社延安十一日电】据美联社中央社消息：南京、广州两地大量公共汽车已因物价暴涨而停驶。广州继续行驶者至十日已不及三分之一，且将继续停驶。停驶汽车之民营车行达九十家，均因汽油价格飞腾，亏累过重所致，车主乘客怨声载道，同时期南京长列的汽道与货车，亦因缺油停驶。
