Column: New Democratic Countries

　　Yugoslavia
　　This land of 247,000 square kilometers, stretching from the Hungarian Plain to near the Aegean Sea, and from the doorstep of Austria to the bottleneck of the Adriatic, is the new democratic Republic of Yugoslavia, led by the famous Yugoslav Communist leader Marshal Tito. It includes Serbians, Croatians, Slovenians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, and Bosnians, with a population of thirteen and a half million, most of whom are farmers.
　　Before the establishment of the new Yugoslavia, like other new democratic countries, Yugoslavia had also experienced the dictatorship of a tyrant, suffered the ravages of the Nazis, and produced some reactionary traitors. Furthermore, there were conflicts and disputes among the various ethnic groups in the country.
　　When Nazi Germany attacked Belgrade in April 1941, the Yugoslav Communist leader Tito organized various ethnic groups and social strata in the country that demanded independence, peace, and democracy. By 1942, it had become a large guerrilla force of 200,000 soldiers, containing 300,000 enemies. After the establishment of the "Liberation Front," it was succeeded by the "National Front," which in June 1944 signed an agreement with the Yugoslav Subasic government-in-exile for mutual cooperation in the struggle against the enemy. After the Red Army liberated Yugoslavia, the new unified Yugoslav government was officially established on March 8, 1945, with Yugoslav Communist leader Marshal Tito as Prime Minister. Under the wise leadership of Marshal Tito, the long-standing ethnic disputes in Yugoslavia disappeared.
　　The new Yugoslavia was officially named the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in November 1945, including six People's Republics: Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, one autonomous province ("Vojvodina"), and one autonomous region (Kosovo-Metohija).
　　The highest organ of power in Yugoslavia is the National Assembly, composed of the Federal Chamber and the Chamber of Nationalities. Representatives to the National Assembly are directly elected by the people through secret ballot. The National Assembly is responsible for electing the cabinet that governs the country. Its cabinet committees are divided into two types, similar to those in the Soviet Union: one is the All-Union departments, which lead and manage various national affairs of Yugoslavia, and the other is the People's Republic departments, which lead the departments of the same name in each People's Republic to handle matters under their respective departments. The Assembly elects a Presidium, which is formally the executive organ, with tasks similar to those of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, namely, announcing the opening and closing of the National Assembly, enacting laws, receiving and appointing ambassadors, and performing duties required by the situation during the adjournment of the National Assembly. Representatives to its Federal Chamber are elected in proportion to the population, with one representative for every 50,000 people. The Chamber of Nationalities is elected based on ethnic units (30 representatives from each republic, 20 from Vojvodina, and 15 from Kosovo-Metohija).
　　In the economic sphere, the new Yugoslavia focuses on state planning and socialization. Major industries, large banks, insurance companies, and other large enterprises are nationalized, cooperative enterprises are developed, and private enterprises that are not harmful to society are allowed. Major economic undertakings such as underground resources, natural energy sources, railways, air transport, telephone, telegraph, postal and radio communications have all been socialized. Last year, in terms of economic recovery, 250,000 houses were rebuilt, 1,000 kilometers of railways were repaired, and hundreds of new factories and enterprises were established. This year, national industrialization and electrification will be implemented.
　　In terms of land reform, the land of enemies, war criminals, and large landlords has been confiscated and redistributed to landless or land-poor farmers, and there are plans to promote experimental collective farms on a considerable scale.
　　Women in Yugoslavia, especially rural women, have always been regarded as appendages of men, with unequal status in political, cultural, and economic fields. However, the birth of the new Yugoslavia has brought them light, liberating them from the shackles of long-term feudal oppression and allowing them to enjoy equal rights with men.
　　In diplomacy, not only was a twenty-year treaty of cooperation, mutual assistance, and friendship signed with the Soviet Union in April 1945, but also a good-neighborly and friendly diplomacy was adopted with neighboring fraternal countries. For example, a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance was signed with Czechoslovakia in May last year, and a treaty of mutual assistance was signed with the Republic of Albania in July. They are determined to unite and defend national independence, freedom, and territorial integrity. (Wu Fang)

　　南斯拉夫
    由匈牙利平原到爱琴海附近，又由奥地利的门口伸展到亚得里亚海的瓶颈上的这一块二十四万七千方公里的土地，就是有名的南共领袖铁托元帅领导的南斯拉夫新民主主义共和国。它包含了塞尔维亚人，克罗提亚人，斯洛文尼亚人，马其顿人，门的尼哥罗人及波斯尼亚人，人口有一千三百五十万，他们大部都是务农。
    在新南斯拉夫没有建立起来以前，南斯拉夫也和其他各新民主主义国家一样，有过暴君的独裁专政，遭受过纳粹的践踏，产生了一些反动派卖国分子，而南国则又有各民族间的对立纷争。
    一九四一年四月纳粹德国进攻南京伯尔格来德时，南共领袖铁托就将国内要求独立和平与民主的各民族各阶层组织了起来，一九四二年成了一支拥有二十万兵士的大游击队，箝制了三十万敌人。并成立了“解放阵线”后又由“民族阵线”继承于一九四四年六月与南斯拉夫苏巴西区流亡政府签订对敌斗争中互相合作的协定，红军解放南国后，南斯拉夫新联合政府在一九四五年三月八日正式成立，南共领袖铁托元帅任总理。在铁托元帅英明领导下，南国存在很久的民族纷争就烟消云散了。
    新南斯拉夫于一九四五年十一月间正式定名南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国，包括了六个人民共和国即塞尔维亚、克罗提亚、斯洛文尼亚、波斯尼亚——赫兹哥维那，门的尼哥罗等，一个自治省“伏之狄那”）与一个自治区（柯索伏——米托希亚）。
    南国最高权力机关是国民大会，由联邦院与民族院合组而成。国民大会代表由人民用秘密投票法直接选出。国民大会负责选出治理国家的内阁，其内阁委员会分为两种与苏联的相同，一为全联盟各部领导和管理南国的全国性的各种事项，二为人民共和国各部，领导各人民共和国同一名称之部，以办理各该部所属事宜。大会选出主席团，在性质上是正式的执行机关，任务与苏联的最高苏维埃主席团类似，即宣布国民大会开会闭会，制定法律，接见与任命大使、国民大会闭会期间执行为情势所需的职务。其联邦院代表系人口比例选出，每五等万人出代表一名，民族院按民族的单位选出（每一共和国出三十名，伏之狄那出二十人，柯索伏——米托希亚出十五人）。
    新南斯拉夫在经济方面注重国家计划与社会化。将各重要工业，大银行，保险公司等大企业收归国营，发展合作事业及对社会无害的私营事业。如地下资源，天然力源、铁路、空运、电话、电报、邮政与无线电交通等各种主要经济事业都已社会化了。去年在经济复兴工作方面，就重建了房屋二十五万栋，修复铁路一千公里，新创数百家工厂企业，今年并将实行国家工业化与电气化。
    在土地改革方面，没收敌人、战犯及大地主等的土地重新分配给无地或少地的农民，并计划推行相当规模的试验性的集体农场。
    南国的妇女，特别是农村的妇女，一向被认为男子的附庸，在政治、文化、经济等各方面与男子地位不平等，但新南斯拉夫的诞生，给她们带来了光明，从长期封建压迫的枷锁中得到了解放，享受着与男子平等的权利。
    外交方面，不但在一九四五年四月间与苏联签订了二十年合作互助友好条约，其与邻邦兄弟国家，也采取亲善睦邻的外交，如去年五月与捷克签订了友谊互助条约，七月间又与阿尔巴尼亚共和国签订了互助条约，他们决心联合一致，保卫国家的独立自由与领土完整。（吴访）
