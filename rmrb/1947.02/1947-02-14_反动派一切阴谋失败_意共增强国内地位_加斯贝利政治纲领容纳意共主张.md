    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th -- According to United Press, Rome: The Italian Communist Party Executive Committee published a communique in the party newspaper "Unità" on the 9th, stating briefly: The solution to the Italian government "crisis is undeniable, the Communist Party has achieved victory, and all attempts to isolate the Communist Party in the parliament and the formation of the government have failed." In the new cabinet, the Italian Communist Party takes over the ministerial positions of the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Justice. On the 9th, the Constituent Assembly also elected a Communist as Speaker of the House, and the Italian Communist Party occupies a pivotal position in the Higher Commission on Food. In addition, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Transportation are already in the hands of left-wing socialists, and the Communist Party has obtained from De Gasperi "precise agreements on the main program issues of the new government." It is generally believed that this agreement includes many Communist Party members participating in workers' committees (which now participate in the management rights of Italy's major industries), and imposing confiscatory heavy taxes on large estates. This has been confirmed in the program released by De Gasperi on the 9th.

    意共增强国内地位
    加斯贝利政治纲领容纳意共主张
    【新华社延安十二日电】据合众社罗马讯：意共执委会于九日在党报《团结》上发表公报，略称：意大利政府“危机的解决是无可否认的，共产党已获胜利，所有想在议会中与政府构成中孤立共产党的一切企图，均告失败”。在新的内阁中，意共接管公共工程部、运输部及司法部等部长职位。九日立宪议会并已选出共产党人为议长，在粮食高级专员委员会中，意共占有枢纽地位。此外，工业部、劳工部，以及交通部已在左翼社会党人手中，共产党已自加斯贝利方面获得“关于新政府主要纲领问题上，精确的约定”。一般相信此约定中包括许多共产党员参加工人委员会，（现在该委员会参与意国主要工业的管理权），及课大地产以没收性的重税。这已在加斯贝利九日发布的纲领中，得到证实。
