[By Our Correspondents] A large-scale communication campaign is underway throughout the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. First, the District Party Committee issued instructions on the 16th of last month, calling for further development of a region-wide communication campaign. Proposals: (1) Responsible comrades of the prefectural and county party committees should treat communication work as one of their leadership tasks, taking time to report, inspect, summarize, and arrange communication work. (2) The propaganda departments of the prefectural and county party committees should regard communication work as one of their central tasks, promptly formulate reporting points, summarize and exchange experiences, and carry out newspaper reading work. (3) The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily should expand its reporting coverage, improve reporting methods, launch competitions, commend models, and adopt leadership methods that follow the mass line. On the same day, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Develop a More Extensive Communication Campaign," praising correspondents in various work positions, reviewing the shortcomings of the past, such as "insufficient integration with reality" and "failure to mobilize the strength of the entire party to organize a stronger communication team," and pointing out that in the future, it is necessary to implement the "the entire party runs the newspaper" principle and the District Party Committee's instruction to "go deep into the masses and integrate with reality." Finally, it called for "holding a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, and establishing merit for the people in reporting work." On the same day, the newspaper published the spring submission competition rules, launching a competition with a prize of 150,000 yuan, setting the date for January 2nd. Since then, a heated communication campaign has unfolded in the region. Yang Pu, a comrade from the Nanhuai County small newspaper editorial team, guaranteed that the county's submission competition would achieve excellent results and decided to strengthen the publication of newspapers. Chen Zongxiang, a communication cadre in Yucheng, received more than forty articles in one month. Fan Yimin, a communication cadre in Linze, received letters from correspondents in various places, all saying: "We must respond to the call of the Party newspaper and are determined to establish merit in communication work." The Dazhong Daily of the Third Sub-district and the Victory Daily of the Fifth Sub-district were re-published successively in the tense guerrilla environment. The Seventh Prefectural Committee has published the "Grand Canal Newspaper," instructing each county committee to equip communication cadres to take the lead in writing articles. In terms of organizational leadership: Yucheng, Yunbei, Qingfeng, Linze and other counties have successively summarized, rectified and established communication organizations. Li Sen, Secretary of the Qiyu County, arranged writing tasks within the agency, stipulating that each person should write at least two articles per month. Li Rongcun, Secretary of Qibin County, personally wrote two articles under the tense conditions of fighting the enemy. A certain unit held a symposium for correspondents during the war intervals to summarize experiences, improve writing methods, and further develop the communication campaign. Wang Xiuzhang, the instructor of a certain battalion, regarded communication work as one of the political tasks.
