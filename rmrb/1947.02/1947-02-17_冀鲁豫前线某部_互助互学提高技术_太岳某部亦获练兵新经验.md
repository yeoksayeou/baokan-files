　　A Unit of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front
    Improves Skills Through Mutual Assistance and Learning
    A Unit of the Taiyue Region Also Gains New Experience in Military Training
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Wang Keqin Movement continues to deepen. The Second Detachment of a unit on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front is using mutual assistance and learning methods to train a large number of new sharpshooters. Using Wang Keqin's teaching methods, after two weeks of "sharpening the knives," this unit cultivated fifteen sharpshooters in a certain heavy machine gun unit, all of whom were trained from new recruits. In live ammunition shooting, each person fired three rounds in succession, averaging above eleven rings, with Comrade Jia Yu scoring twenty-two rings alone. To practice nighttime actions, all comrades learned to troubleshoot and disassemble/reassemble the machine gun, while blindfolded. Geng Genchang was the fastest, completing the disassembly and reassembly in just twelve minutes. The thirty-nine light machine gunners cultivated through two weeks of "sharpening the knives" scored well in live ammunition shooting, with Su Jincheng scoring twenty-two rings and Wang Jianzhong scoring eighteen rings. After the Seventh Squad of the Fifth Platoon was transferred to the machine gun squad, because they were all new comrades, they helped each other learn during the mutual assistance "knife sharpening" without resting. After two weeks, the squad's live ammunition shooting averaged above fifteen rings.
    [Dispatch from this Newspaper, Taiyue, 15th] The Third Company of a certain unit is conducting military training during lulls in the war, achieving great results in the past week. In grenade throwing, they progressed from twenty-five meters to over thirty meters. Soldiers Zhang Dengke and Gao Yunbiao even threw to forty-two meters. Most of the bayonet skills have been learned, and they are now striving for proficiency. The summary of training experience is as follows: First, the Jiao Wubao mutual assistance movement was adopted, with veteran and new soldiers teaching each other. The entire company has three military training mutual assistance groups. In the Song Zhu mutual assistance group, new recruit Zhang Zhangxu could only throw twenty meters at the beginning, and his arm ached after a few days of training. Song Zhu patiently explained to him: "To protect your own life and property, you must learn the skills to kill the enemy. Learning skills requires hard work, and the arm will no longer hurt if you work harder." So Zhang Zhangxu practiced after meals and while walking. Later, he could throw thirty-five meters, and his arm no longer hurt. The Li Jianwu group practices with small cannons, and the group leader patiently helps others learn. Newcomers Meng Yuansheng and He Jinkui have learned to operate the cylinders and aim. Second, any progress, no matter how small, is immediately praised. Third, the company commander personally takes the lead in hard training, implementing officers teaching soldiers and soldiers teaching officers. Fourth, the entire company, group against group, and squad against squad, proposes competitions, requiring fast and good training. Fifth, improve the life of the entire company, increase the supply of boiled water, and eat meat once every seven days to improve everyone's training morale.

　　冀鲁豫前线某部
    互助互学提高技术
    太岳某部亦获练兵新经验
    【本报特讯】王克勤运动继续深入，冀鲁豫前线某部二分队，用互助互学方式训练大批新射手。该部以王克勤的教学方式，经过两周“磨刀”后，某重机枪单位培养出十五个射手，都是从新战士中培养出来的。实弹射击每人连发三弹，平均十一环以上，贾玉同志独得廿二环。为着练习夜间动作，他们每个同志都蒙上眼学会排除故障和大小拆卸，耿根昌最快，拆装一次只要十二分钟。经过两周“磨刀”培养的三十九名轻机枪射手，在实弹射击中，苏金城中二十二环，王建忠中十八环。五小队七班调到机枪班后，因为他们都是新同志，在互助“磨刀”中，他们不休息，互相帮助学习，该班经两周时，实弹射击平均十五环以上。
    【本报太岳十五日电】某部队三连在战争空隙中进行练兵，一周来获得巨大成绩。投弹方面从二十五米进到卅余米。战士张登科、高云标且掷投到四十二米。刺枪已大部学会，现正向熟练方面努力。总结练兵经验如下：第一，采用了焦五保互助运动，老战士新战士你教我，我教你。全连有三个练兵互助组。宋柱互助组新战士张章许，开始只能投二十米，练了几天臂痛起来。宋柱就耐心地与他解释：“要保卫自己的生命财产，就得学会杀敌本事，学本事不能不下苦，再苦练臂就不痛了。”于是张章许饭后也练，走路也练。后来能投卅五米，臂也不痛了。李建武组练小炮，组长耐心帮助别人学习，生手孟元生、贺金魁已学会上下筒子和瞄准。第二，一有进步，不论大小都立刻表扬。第三，连长亲自带头苦练，实行官教兵、兵教官。第四，全连组与组、班与班提出竞赛。要求作到练得快，练得好。第五，改善全连生活，增加开水，七天吃一次肉，提高大家练兵情绪。
