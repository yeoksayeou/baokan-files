Moreover, it must be understood that the masses themselves are not inherently backward. The existence of backward elements is primarily due to the lack of in-depth leadership and work. For example, some cadres and activists often look down on those who are backward; some have not broken free from feudal clan sentiments, fatalistic views, or thoughts of changing the world; and some live far away in mountain villages and remote huts, which cadres rarely visit, and other reasons. When mobilizing backward peasants, the first step is to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, guiding both sides to reflect. Cadres should "wash their faces," giving affirmative signals to peasants who have not yet turned themselves around, leading them to do so, and supporting them in the struggle to boost their confidence and courage to turn themselves around. Among backward elements, they should be enlightened to compare themselves with those who have turned themselves around. How did others manage to turn themselves around? Clarify their own path to struggle and turn themselves around. Many villages in Huguan started from this point to involve backward elements in the movement. Secondly, under the slogan of "leaving no backward peasant behind," cadres conducted thorough investigations and visits door-to-door in mountain villages. Many cadres in Changzhi were assigned tasks, each finding an object to mobilize, and then using those who were more enlightened to arouse others by sharing their sufferings, connecting them with others, which proved to be very effective. In Changzhi, the three villages of Huzhai, Beidong, and Yincheng alone mobilized all two hundred and thirty-four backward peasants to consciously rise up and struggle. In Huguan Dian, a cadre followed a shepherd for three days, patiently persuading him until the shepherd's mind opened up and he became active. Furthermore, through widespread publicity of the policy of "land to the tiller," the idea that one could not turn oneself around without problems was broken. They were enlightened to pour out their grievances, recognize that all the enjoyment of the landlords came from the blood and sweat of the peasants, break the views of conscience and fate, and consciously struggle with reason and strength. In the three villages of Beidong in Changzhi, statistics show that three hundred and twenty people who had never uttered a word in previous movements are now actively participating in the struggle.

    干部耐心深入检查
    各找对象以苦引苦
    另外必须了解群众本身无所谓落后，所以有落后分子的存在，主要是领导与工作不深入的原因，如有些干部、积极分子多看不起落后，有些因封建宗族情面命运或变天思想等未打破，有些是远住山庄窝铺，干部经常不到等等原因。在发动落后农民时，首先是改善干部与群众的关系，引导双方反省，干部洗脸，给未翻身农民肯定表示，领导他们翻身，在斗争中给他们撑腰，以鼓舞其翻身信心和勇气。在落后分子中要启发他和翻身户比较，人家是怎样翻身，明确自己起来斗争翻身的道路，壶关好多村庄是从这样下手把落后分子卷入运动的。其次是在“不留一个落后农民”的口号下，干部挨门逐户深入山庄进行检查访问。长治有不少干部分工，各找发动对象，再以先觉悟了的以苦引苦，串通别人，这样收效很大，长治仅琥寨、北董、荫城三个村，即发动所有二百三十四个落后农民自觉起来斗争。壶关店一个干部跟上羊工放了三天羊，苦口劝说，这个羊工脑筋才开了，积极起来。再次经过广泛宣传耕者有其田的政策，打破了没问题不能翻身的想法。启发诉苦，认清地主一切享受都是农民血汗，打破良心命运观点，自觉斗争有理有力。长治北董等三村统计有三百二十个人在以前运动中，一言不发，现都积极参加斗争。
