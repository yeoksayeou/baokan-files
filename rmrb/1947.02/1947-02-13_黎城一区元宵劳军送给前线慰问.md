    Licheng First District Yuanxiao Festival Laboring the Troops
    Sending Comfort to the Front Lines
    [Our newspaper’s Licheng dispatch] During the Yuanxiao Festival, the first district of this county enthusiastically labored the troops, sending 131,465 yuan in comfort money, 108 letters of sympathy, and 263 comfort bags to the front lines. On the thirteenth and fourteenth days of the lunar calendar, the district first held village meetings to review the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families over the past year. Shen Mugu, a turned-over hero from Liangwu Village, said at the meeting: "Today we have been liberated and cannot forget the Eighth Route Army. In the past, I thought it was troublesome to support the army, which was wrong." Li Siping, the secretary of the Women's Federation, proposed making comfort bags for the soldiers at the front, which was unanimously supported by the women. On the fourteenth alone, 96 comfort bags and letters of sympathy were sent to the front. (Ren Qing, Ri Sheng)
