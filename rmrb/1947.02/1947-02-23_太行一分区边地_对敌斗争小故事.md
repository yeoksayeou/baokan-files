　　Taihang First District Border Area
    Small Stories of the Struggle Against the Enemy
    Zhu Jiong
    If you dare come again, I'll make you roll out again!
    On the evening of December 22nd last year, more than 30 enemies (Homecoming Corps) from Tian Village surrounded Xujiazhuang in the Third District of Gaoyi. Three enemies went to Liu Rongzi's house (his brother works in the district). Rongzi waited behind the door with his weapon - a dung fork. The enemy said in the yard, "Rongzi, hand over your gun." "Come in and get it!" Rongzi said from inside the house. The enemy, holding a gun, immediately walked into the house, about to step through the door. Rongzi stabbed at the enemy with the dung fork - "Get out!" The enemy stepped back in fright and shouted in the yard, "Rongzi, if you don't hand over your gun, we'll stab you to death with a bayonet." "Come on, if you dare to come again, I'll make you son of a bitch roll out again!" Rongzi said from inside the house. The enemy was furious and stubbornly tried to enter, but Rongzi drove him out again with the dung fork. After three attempts, the enemy couldn't get in. The enemy was annoyed and set the house on fire... Just as the situation was critical, the machine guns in the east of the village started to fire, and the High Independent援 army arrived. The enemy had no choice but to hurriedly carry a bloody喽@ and run back.
    The Women's Association Director's "Thunder" is Popular
    Zhang Rong, the Deputy Director of the Women's Association of Sun Village, Fifth District of Zanhuang, is usually very active in preparedness work. She personally made many stone mines and buried them around the house, with the wires placed on top of the house. If the enemy comes, she can pull the wire to detonate the mine on whichever side of the house they are on.
    At the end of November last year, more than 50 "Homecoming Corps" members from Yuanshi City came to his village to rob grain. She closed the gate and went up to the roof. The enemy had already reached her door. She threw a hand grenade, preventing the enemy from advancing. The enemy turned to the back, preparing to climb the house. Comrade Zhang Rong saw the enemy's intention and detonated the landmines behind the house. One enemy was wounded. The enemy turned to the east, and the landmines on the east also exploded. Turning to the west, the landmines on the west also exploded. After holding out for more than half an hour, the joint defense militia came and drove the enemy away. The enemy didn't take anything.

　　太行一分区边地
    对敌斗争小故事
    朱炯
    你敢再来，就叫你再滚出去
    去年十二月二十二日晚，田村敌人（还乡团）三十多人包围了高邑三区徐家庄。三个敌人到刘荣子（他哥在区工作）家，荣子拿着他的武器——粪叉在门后等着。敌人在院里说：“荣子缴枪”。“进来拿吧！”荣子在房内说。敌人端着枪即往房内走，将垮进门，荣子用粪叉向敌人一刺——“滚出去吧！”。敌人吓的倒退几步，在院内又喊叫“荣子，你若不缴枪，进去非拿刺刀刺死你不可。”“你来吧，你若再来；就叫你狗日的再滚出去！”，荣子在房内说。敌人气极了，硬着头皮往进走；但又被荣子用粪叉赶出来。一连三次，敌人都进不去。敌人恼了，就用火点房子……正危急中，村东机枪哒哒的叫起来，高独援兵赶来了。敌人只好慌慌忙忙，抬着血淋淋的一个喽＠跑回去了。
    妇会主任的“雷”吃香了
    赞皇五区孙庄妇女会付主任张荣同志，平时对备战工作很积极，亲自打了很多石雷埋在房子四周，把线都放在房子上面，若敌人来，上了房子要那一面炸，就拉那一根线。
    去年十一月底元氏城“还乡团”五十多人到他村抢粮。她关上大门上了房子，敌人已经到她的门口；他便投下一个手榴弹，使敌人再不敢前进，敌人转到后面准备爬房子。张荣同志看清敌人的企图，便拉炸了房后的地雷，一个敌人被炸伤了，敌人转到东边，东边的地雷也爆炸了；转到西边，西边的地雷又爆炸了。坚持了半点多种，联防民兵来把敌人赶走了。敌人一点东西也没有抢走。
