    [Urgent Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, February 5th] The Eighth Route Army in the Yuwansu Military Region south of the Longhai Railway, from January 30th to February 2nd, successively captured five county towns including Zhecheng, Taikang, Luyi, Qixian in eastern Henan, and Boxian in northwestern Anhui. Most of the lost territory in the Yuwansu Liberated Area has been recovered. On the evening of January 30th, the Eighth Route Army south of the Longhai Railway, after two hours of intense fighting, recovered Zhecheng, annihilating two security regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Ministry of National Defense. On January 31st, the Eighth Route Army followed up with a victory by recovering Taikang. On the morning of February 1st, Luyi was recovered, and all Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops entrenched in the city were wiped out. On the same day, Qixian was also recovered. At 8 p.m. on February 2nd, Boxian was recaptured, and all Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops entrenched in the city were also completely destroyed. The 16th Brigade of the 75th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army rushed to reinforce, but were mostly annihilated in an area five miles north of Boxian. The above battles yielded abundant spoils, and the results are currently being tallied. Note: The above-mentioned five counties suffered greatly in the early stages of the War of Resistance due to the Kuomintang's decision to breach the Yellow River dike. For several years, the people of this area struggled bitterly under the combined attacks of the Japanese invaders and the Yellow River flood. Fortunately, under the leadership and assistance of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, they established democratic anti-Japanese regimes and persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. After the Japanese surrender, Qixian and Taikang were liberated from the hands of the enemy and puppets by the Eighth Route Army on August 31st and September 25th of the 34th year of the Republic of China respectively. They were invaded by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops on October 5th and 14th of the same year. In mid-August of last year, they were recovered by the Eighth Route Army again, and in late August they were reoccupied by Chiang's troops. Zhecheng was also recovered by our forces last year, but was later invaded by puppet troops. Now that the people of the five cities have been liberated from the oppression and trampling of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, they are overjoyed and bow their heads in celebration, one after another accusing the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops of their crimes to the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government. Order in each city has now been restored, shops have opened for business, and the people are rejoicing and celebrating the Lantern Festival.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, February 5th: The Jinzhong Eighth Route Army recovered Wenshui County, on the Taiyuan-Fenyang line, and Kaishan, an important town between Wenshui and Jiaocheng, on February 2nd. The battle to recover Wenshui began at 2 p.m. on February 2nd and ended in six minutes. The city was liberated from the hands of the Japanese invaders by the Eighth Route Army on September 1st two years ago, and was occupied by Yan Xishan's troops on September 9th, after which it became a springboard for attacking the Fenyang-Xiaoyi Liberated Area. Kaishan Town was occupied by Yan Xishan's troops on June 14th last year. In the battles in the above two places, over 2,000 Yan Xishan soldiers, including Tang Jianqiu, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the 72nd Division of the Yan army, and Zhang Yuxiu, Commander of the 215th Regiment, were captured alive.
