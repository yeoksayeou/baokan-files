　　Following Zhang Yongtai's Path to a Good Life
    Landlord Li Sanhai Achieves Prosperity Through Labor

    [Reported by This Newspaper] After rent reduction and liquidation in Hongbao Village, Heshun, landlord Li Sanhai and his family engaged in production and now live a prosperous life. Li was a large landlord in Hongbao Township, owning four and a half qing of land, seventeen head of livestock, and employing six and a half long-term laborers, sheep herders, and cattle herders. He used to live solely by exploiting tenant farmers and hired laborers. After the area was liberated the year before last, his property was mostly used to compensate the losses of the farmers after two rounds of mass struggle and liquidation. He retained fifty-five mu of land and one large and one small ox. At first, he was very pessimistic. Later, after the government explained that all income from labor would belong to him, he increased his confidence in "living by labor." So, he actively persuaded his entire family to join last year's great production campaign. His family had four male full laborers, two half laborers, six female full laborers, and two half laborers. They were divided into male and female groups. The men reclaimed wasteland, and the women cut down forests, collected tree roots for fertilizer, and delivered meals. As a result, they reclaimed seventy mu of wasteland (and thirty mu of felled forest land that had not yet been reclaimed). They applied 100 to 200 dan of fertilizer per mu, more than anyone else. Although Heshun suffered wind, frost, and rain last year, his family still harvested sixty-eight shi of grain. In addition, using their spare time, the men went out to do odd jobs and transportation, and the women spun cotton and made shoes. The annual income was five shi of jade millet, eleven jin of cotton, eighty-five zhang of homespun cloth, and 27,000 yuan. Besides food and clothing for the whole family, there was still a considerable surplus. Last autumn, they bought one and a half donkeys, and now they are preparing to buy another one and reclaim another hundred mu of wasteland. He is very satisfied with the government's policy of rewarding production and often says, "Labor money lasts for ten thousand years." Recently, he responded to the government's call to develop the textile industry and sent his sister-in-law to Keju Village to learn weaving.

　　走张永泰道路过好时光
    地主李三孩劳动发家
    【本报讯】和顺红堡村地主李三孩经过减租清算，全家动手生产，现在生活富裕。李是红堡乡的大地主，原有土地四顷半，牲口十七头，雇长工、羊工、牛工共六个半人。专靠剥削雇佃农度日。前年该地解放后，经过两度群众斗争清算，财产大部赔偿了农民损失。留下土地五十五亩，大小牛各一头。开始他很悲观，后经政府解释，明白了今后劳动所得全归自己，提高了“靠劳动生活”的信心，于是积极说服全家，一齐投入去年的大生产运动。他家有男全劳力四个，半劳力二个，女全劳力六个，半劳力二个，分成男女两组，男人开荒，女人伐林、拾树根积肥、送饭，结果开荒七十亩（还有伐倒林未开的三十亩）。每亩上粪一百担至二百担，比谁家都上得多。去年和顺虽遭风霜雨灾，他家仍收粮六十八大石。此外，利用剩余时间，男人出去打短工、运输，女人纺花、做鞋，全年收入玉菱五石、棉花十一斤、土布八丈五，洋二万七千元。除全家吃穿外，还有不少富余。去秋买驴一头半，现在又准备再买一头，再开荒一百亩。他对民主政府奖励生产的政策非常满意，时常说：“劳动钱万万年。”最近又响应政府发展纺织的号召，派弟媳到科举村学习织布。
