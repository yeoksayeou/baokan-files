    【Report from the JiluYu Front, 10th of this month】 General Liu Bocheng has recently received many letters of gratitude from the people in various parts of Southwestern Shandong, thanking the victorious army under his command for liberating them. The people of Tang Village, Fan County, in a gilded letter of thanks to General Liu, stated: "General, with your patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit, you have chilled the heart of the bandit Chiang with one battle and shattered the courage of the Chiang army with another. The recovery of cities such as Fan, Yun, Jia, and Ju, and the regaining of liberation by the people, is due to your general's功也 (gōng yě, achievement). General, your prestige is as heavy as Mount Tai, and your merits are towering. You are truly the savior of the people." The comfort letter from the people of the Tenth District of Juancheng said: "In twenty-six days, the Eighth Route Army recovered thirteen county towns, and more than 30,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were annihilated. You are heroes who win every battle, and you are the capable pillars defending peace, freedom, and democracy. We are now sending young and strong people to serve in the front and rear as porters for the wounded soldiers and guards for the prisoners. At the same time, we are intensifying the struggle against counter-reckoning and ensuring the completion of land reform before the spring plowing."
