　　Defend the Fruits of Victory, Prepare for Counter-Offensive
　　陵川(Lingchuan) Sees a Thousand People Join the Army in Two Days
　　[Report from this newspaper in 陵川(Lingchuan)] After sweeping away feudal remnants and returning land to the peasants, the consciousness of armed struggle has soared to unprecedented heights. The peasants of 陵川(Lingchuan) are rising up to join the army, defending the fruits of victory and preparing for the counter-offensive. Guo Laizhong, a 22-year-old youth from 平城(Pingcheng) Township, said when signing up: "My cows are tethered behind the trough, the sheep are watched inside the house, I live in a brick house, and the grain is upstairs. Why shouldn't I join the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek!" In the same township, sixty-nine people, as consciously as him, signed up to join the army. In the Seventh District, after only one day and two nights of mobilization, a total of 360 people flocked to the district to sign up. Military dependents such as Zhang Cun, Zhao Xiu'e, and Wang Fuling also resolutely wanted to go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Wang Laifu from 下河(Xiahe) was too short, and failed the physical examination the last time he signed up. This time, people advised him to wait until he grew taller, but he was very dissatisfied and went to the county to sign up himself. Xue Baigou from 下川(Xiachuan) also voluntarily joined the army after his family's fortunes were turned around. Someone advised him to finish his middle school education, but he said: "The Eighth Route Army is a great university, and fighting Chiang Kai-shek is more important than going to school." In many districts, the number of people joining the army exceeded the original plan. The Fifth District originally planned to mobilize forty people, but ninety people signed up within half a day. In the Sixth District, 360 people signed up in one day. In the entire county, more than a thousand people joined the army within two days.
