    Frontline Troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Improve Military Reporting
    The troops on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front are striving to improve military reporting work, organizing cultural soldiers to actively write articles. The Propaganda Department of the "Hezheng" Department, in order to improve future military reporting work, held a symposium after the New Year, calling on everyone to organize writing and reading newspapers, advocating that soldiers dictate and cadres write on their behalf, and those who hold pens should praise those who hold guns. At the meeting, Comrade Peng Mingchuan, director of the Political Department of a certain regiment, who organized 12 articles in three days during a battle and wrote three articles himself, and Comrade Jia Lufeng, chief of the Organization Section, who was good at combining communication reports with his own work, were commended and rewarded. Comrades Sun Hanmin and Wang Changrong, who were responsible for the typesetting of small newspapers in various troops, were also commended. After the "Army Building News" of a certain unit put forward the slogan "Large pens and small pens move together" during a field battle, it received more than 100 articles from more than 20 instructors, company commanders, instructors, health captains, clerks, and soldiers.
