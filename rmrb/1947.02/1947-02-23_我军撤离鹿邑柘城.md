Our People's Liberation Army, having completed its mission of depleting the enemy south of the Longhai Railway, actively withdrew from the Liuhe to Xiaoba section of the Longhai Railway and the two cities of Luyi and Zhecheng on the 14th, 16th, and 17th, respectively. They moved to advantageous positions and surrounded the intruding Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division and local reactionary puppet forces.
