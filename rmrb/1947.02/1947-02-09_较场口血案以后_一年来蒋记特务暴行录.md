After the Jiao Chang Kou Bloodshed – A Record of Chiang Kai-shek's Special Agent Atrocities in the Past Year

On February 10th last year, over twenty organizations from Chongqing's cultural, industrial, and agricultural sectors enthusiastically convened a meeting at Jiao Chang Kou to celebrate the victory of the Political Consultative Conference. As the conference began, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents swarmed the stage, wielding clubs, throwing stones, and violently attacking the presidium and the participating masses. More than sixty people, including Guo Moruo, Ma Yinchu, Li Gongpu, workers, and journalists, were injured.

Now, a year has passed since the "February 10th Bloodshed." In this year, Chiang Kai-shek has sabotaged peace, suppressed democracy, strangled public opinion, and carried out countless bloody atrocities in murdering democratic人士. I will now list some of the major incidents:

February 20th last year: The Peiping (Beiping) Special Agent Office gathered a large number of agents to surround the Military Mediation Execution Department, barging into the offices, causing disturbances and shouting, bringing the work of the execution department to a standstill for several hours.

February 22nd: The Kuomintang reactionaries created anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda, buying, deceiving, and inciting a portion of Chongqing students to hold anti-democratic demonstrations. Chiang's special agents seized the opportunity to destroy the Chongqing Xinhua Daily business department and the Democratic League's organ, the Democratic Daily business department, injuring four Xinhua Daily employees and five Democratic Daily employees. The destroyed newspapers and books were piled up on the street and inside the newspaper offices, reaching waist-high.

February 24th: Students at Yenching University in Chengdu refused to participate in anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic demonstrations, and the school gate was destroyed by special agents.

March 1st: Special agent students at Fudan University, because the "Valley Wind" wall newspaper criticized the anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people demonstrations in Chongqing, "publicly tried" editor Zhuang Ming. Professors Hong Shen and others went to dissuade them but were beaten and chased by special agent students. On the same day, Chiang's special agents in Xi'an used White Russian hooligans and Korean vagrants to destroy the business department of the joint edition of the Valley Wind Industry and Commerce Daily. The Eighth Route Army office was also disturbed.

March 9th: Northeast People's Leader, Commander of the 3rd Army of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, General Li Zhaolin, was assassinated by Chiang's special agents in his private residence in Harbin.

March 18th: More than 20,000 students and civilians in Nantong welcomed the arrival of the Huaiyin team and held demonstrations. Chiang's special agents carried out slaughter and destruction. The eyes and nose of Sun Daping, a reporter for the Minguo Daily, were gouged out, and his body was thrown into the Yangtze River at Tianshenggang. More than 30 staff members of various organizations and faculty and students from various schools were arrested and disappeared.

April 21st: The Beiping National Assembly Representative Election Promotion Association held a lecture on the National Assembly Representative election issue in Zhongshan Park. When Professor Chen Jinkun took the stage to speak, pre-arranged special agent thugs threw bricks and tiles at the stage and into the crowd. Professor Chen suffered serious head injuries, and more than ten students were injured. Professor Jiang Yuan and Mr. Foster, the head of the US Information Office, were also beaten.

April 22nd: The Chengdu Minzhong (People's) Times store was destroyed by special agents, and the Guangzhou Huashang (Chinese Merchants') Daily and Zheng Bao (Upright Report) branch stores were also destroyed.

May 1st: The current president of Yan'an University, Mr. Li Furen, was kidnapped by special agents in Xi'an and assassinated in Xianyang. He was later rescued by a farmer, narrowly escaping death.

May 4th: The Guangzhou Kuomintang reactionaries instigated students to hold a so-called "patriotic" movement meeting. During the march, a large number of special agents seized the opportunity to rush into the Hong Kong Huashang Daily, the Guangzhou branch of the Zheng Bao, and the Brothers Book Company, carrying out extensive destruction.

June 23rd: More than ten representatives of people's organizations in Shanghai, including Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Zhang Jibo, and Lei Jieqiong, took a train to Nanjing to petition the Kuomintang authorities and Marshall for peace and to oppose the civil war. When Mr. Ma and others arrived at Xiaguan Station, pre-arranged Chiang Kai-shek's special agents surrounded Mr. Ma and others in the station, verbally abused and insulted them. More than ten representatives, including Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, and Gao Ji, a reporter from the Dagong Bao, and Pu Xixiu, a reporter from the Xinmin Bao who were at the scene covering the event, were beaten and injured.

July 11th: Mr. Li Gongpu, one of the "Seven Gentlemen" of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, was assassinated by Chiang's special agents in Kunming on his way home from the street, dying as a result.

July 15th: While Li Gongpu's bloodstains were still fresh, Wen Yiduo, a famous writer and professor at Southwest Associated University, and his son, Wen Lihe, were ambushed on the way out of the Democratic Weekly office at Fuyong Road No. 14 by several Chiang's special agents who surrounded them and opened fire. Mr. Wen was seriously injured and died on the way to the hospital, and his son was also seriously injured.

July 18th: Sun Zhongyuan, of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, was kidnapped by special agents.

August 6th: The Chongqing office of the Chinese Labor Association was forcibly taken over by more than 20 soldiers and police officers and plainclothes special agents led by reactionaries. Chiang's special agents severely tortured 38 arrested labor association personnel, attempting to fabricate evidence to frame the arrested personnel in order to cover up their crime of forcibly occupying the labor association.

August 18th: Zhang Lan, chairman of the Democratic League, was beaten by special agents while presiding over the memorial service for Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo in Chengdu.

November 25th: Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Chinese Labor Association and executive member of the International Federation of Trade Unions, was stabbed by Chiang's special agents in Hong Kong for refusing to participate in the puppet National Assembly.

Every atrocity listed above, directed by Chiang Kai-shek through his special agents, has been met with righteous resistance from the Chinese people. Although Chiang Kai-shek, in order to continue to uphold his traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policies, will further intensify the suppression of people's freedom and the strangulation of democracy through special agent rule, the Chinese people will not be deterred. They will certainly inherit the spirit of the sacrificed democratic fighters and resolutely struggle against the dictators. Their calls and actions for independence, democracy, and peace will become even louder and more widespread. (Wu Fang)

    较场口血案以后
    ——一年来蒋记特务暴行录
    去年二月十日，重庆文化界、工业界、农业的界等二十多个团体热烈地在较场口开会庆祝政协会议的胜利，大会刚开始的时候，蒋记特务蜂涌上台，挥动棍棒乱掷石子毒打主席团及参加大会的群众，郭沫若、马寅初、李公朴、工人、新闻记者等六十多人受伤。
    现在“二一○血案”已一年了，这一年中，蒋介石破坏和平，摧残民主、绞杀舆论，杀害民主人士的血腥暴行，简直不胜枚举，兹仅就其荤荤大者，列举于下：
    去年二月二十日：北平特务机关，纠集大批特务分子包围军事调处执行部，闯入办公处，骚扰叫嚣，使执行部工作停顿达数小时之久。
    二月二十二日：国民党反动派制造反苏反共舆论，收买欺骗与煽动重庆一部分学生举行反民主的游行，蒋特即乘机捣毁重庆新华日报营业部及民主同盟机关报民主报营业部、打伤新华日报职员四人，及民主报职员五人，被毁的报纸与书籍在街上及报馆内堆着，高及腰际。
    二月二十四日：成都燕大学生拒绝参加反苏反共反民主的游行，校门被特务捣毁。
    三月一日：复旦大学特务学生，因“谷风”壁报批评渝市反苏反共反人民游行，而“公审”编辑庄明三。洪琛等教授前往劝阻，被特务学生殴打追击。同日，西安蒋特务用白俄流氓与朝鲜浪人捣毁谷风工商日报联合版营业部，八路军办事处也被扰乱。

    五月四日：广州国民党反动派策动学生举行所谓“爱国”运动大会，至游行时，大批特务乘机冲入香港华商报，正报的广州分社及兄弟图书公司，大肆捣毁。
    六月二十三日：沪市各界人民团体代表马叙伦、阎宝航、张继伯、雷洁琼等十余人为反对内战要求和平，乘车赴京。向国民党当局及马歇尔请愿，当马氏等抵下关车站时，预伏的蒋记特务将马氏等包围于车站内，谩骂侮辱，马叙伦、阎宝航、雷洁琼、陈震中等代表及在场采访的大公报记者高集，新民报记者浦熙修等十余人都被殴受伤。
