　　[Our Newspaper] More than 20,000 people in Changzhi Lucheng carried gifts to comfort the Democratic National Construction Army during the Lantern Festival and held a support-the-army meeting locally. At the meeting, Deputy Commissioner Hou of the Third Special District first delivered a speech, and then Commander-in-Chief Gao thanked the masses on behalf of the entire army, stating the history of the Democratic National Construction Army and its future mission to follow Chairman Mao in striving for the liberation cause of the Chinese people. Finally, they reviewed each other, which promoted further unity between the army and the people. The meeting ended with the slogan "The army and the people are one family." In addition, the masses in the fourth district of Lucheng and the Second Army of the Democratic National Construction Army also held a military-civilian get-together in Huangnian on the same day.

　　长治潞城两万人
    慰劳民主建国军
    【本报讯】长治潞城两万余群众于元宵节纷纷携带礼物，慰劳民主建国军，并在当地举行拥军大会。会上，三专署侯副专员首先致词，随即高总司令代表全军向群众致谢，申述民主建国军历史及今后跟随毛主席为中国人民解放事业奋斗的任务。最后彼此检讨，促进了军民更进一步的团结，大会在“军民一家”的口号中结束。又潞城四区群众与民主建国军第二军亦于同日在黄碾举行军民联欢会，民主建国军第二军军长乔明礼将军、潞城县长赵军同志均前往参加。
