　　Taihang Jinnan Bank Branches
    Set Production and Savings Plans
    Huguan Cadres Lower Living Standards
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 20th] In the production and savings campaign, cadres of the Taihang District Jinnan Bank branches launched a major ideological review, adopting a method of concentrating cadres from the district bank and various sub-district branches for introspection. The leadership also put forward the slogan "wash your face," calling on all cadres to thoroughly eliminate hedonistic thoughts, strictly enforce various bank systems, eradicate waste and disguised corruption, and call for production and savings to solve their own living difficulties through self-reliance. The district bank and the first and fourth branches have now completed their inspections. Individual cadres' violations of the system and disguised corruption have been resolved. The enthusiasm of all cadres has doubled. They are determined to implement the spirit of hard struggle, run the bank well for the Party and the people, and welcome victory. Cadres' living standards have been generally reduced in accordance with this spirit, and plans for production and savings for this year have been initiated. The district bank has decided to organize a cadres' mutual aid cooperative, mainly engaged in agricultural, sideline, and handicraft production, supplemented by commerce. Five to ten percent of the profits will be used to solve the medical and other difficulties of poor cadres' families. Banks at all levels will be organized accordingly. Cadres' family members will also be educated to support themselves through production and change their reliance on public care.
    [This newspaper reports] The Huguan County Government, in response to the call for production and savings, launched a campaign to save food and clothing to perform meritorious service for the people. On the 8th, the county held a cadres' meeting to resolve the hedonistic thoughts of individual cadres and unanimously decided to lower the living standards of the government organs. Each person made concrete savings plans. The cadres and service personnel attending the meeting were in high spirits and unanimously agreed to meet the established standards of meritorious service. At that time, it was resolved that the 70 people in the county government, bank, and treasury would reduce their monthly white flour ration from 15 meals to 4 meals. In addition, 70 straw hats and 160 catties of yellow tobacco would be saved. Thirty-five people incorporated daily necessities and allowances into their savings plans.
