    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 5th] After Chiang's puppet army under the traitor Cheng Daosheng occupied the area south of the Zhang River in Wei County in January, they colluded with local lawless landlords to carry out massacres and looting. In just ten days, in more than twenty villages in the third district of Wei County, they massacred more than seventy village cadres and family members of soldiers. The number of those arrested, missing, and subjected to severe torture is impossible to count. After the lawless landlord He Guangmeng and others from Lijiao Village in that district returned to their village with Cheng, they looted all the grain and belongings from the homes of the village militia members and smashed all the pots and pans in each household. The seventy-year-old mother of militia member Wang Dianjia was beaten so severely that she was bedridden. Wang Mengzhou, the deputy director of the Farmers' Association, was burned to ashes by the enemy; his eldest son, Wang Weiping, was shot dead, and his six-year-old son was hacked to death. His wife, after being severely beaten, hanged herself due to unbearable pain. The entire family of five was left with only one orphaned young daughter. The atrocities of Chiang's puppet army and lawless landlords have not subdued the strong will of the masses. Now the masses in the third district have wiped away their tears and risen up with homemade weapons to wage guerrilla warfare with the stubborn puppets.

    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 5th] A report from the front-line reporters of the Jinnan Branch: In the area south of the Zhang River in Wei County, the masses are rising up against Chiang's atrocities in response to the killings and robberies by Chiang's army. With our cadres holding meetings everywhere and the militia actively attacking the enemy and striking at the "Home-Returning Corps," the evil forces have been suppressed. The "Home-Returning Corps" mostly hide in strongholds, and no evil landlord dares to "settle accounts." In Yangquan Village in the fourth district, two reckless hooligans became Chiang's puppet village chiefs and acted tyrannically. After repeated warnings were ignored, they were executed. After this news spread, many landlords and despots in other villages did not dare to work for the enemy. Some who were village chiefs even consulted with the masses on matters. The head of the "Home-Returning Corps" in Xiaocangkou wanted to "settle accounts," but when he heard that our cadres and militia were active nearby, he dared not "settle accounts." The masses in the fourth district openly discussed in the streets and alleys without any fear: "They (referring to the 'Home-Returning Corps' and the landlords) say their day has dawned, but I think it is still our day that has dawned." Now the masses in this area are full of victorious confidence in the anti-Chiang struggle. They say: "If Chiang's army and the Home-Returning Corps kill one of us, burn down one of our houses, and rob one of our families, then there will be millions of people to avenge us."

    魏县人民纷起抗蒋
    民兵痛击还乡团
    地主不敢“倒算”
    【本报威县五日电】蒋伪军程逆道生部自元月进占我魏县漳河以南地区后，结合当地不法地主，大肆残杀抢掠，仅十天的时间，在魏县三区二十来个村内，即残杀我村干及军属七十多人，被捕失踪及遭受严刑拷打者，无法统计，该区理教村不法地主贺光孟等随程逆返乡后，将该村所有民兵家内粮食什物抢掠一空，并将各家锅碗瓢勺砸碎，民兵王殿甲七十岁的老母被毒打得卧床不起，农会副主任王孟周被敌烧焦成灰，其大儿王未平被枪杀，六岁小儿被劈死，其妻被毒打后因疼痛难忍悬梁自缢，全家五口只剩一孤苦幼女。蒋伪军及不法地主之暴行，并未压服群众的坚强意志，现三区群众已擦泪奋起拿起土造武器，随民兵与顽伪展开游击战争。
    【本报威县五日电】冀南分社前线记者团报导：魏县漳河南岸地区，群众在蒋军抢杀下，纷纷奋起抗蒋暴行。在我干部到处开会和民兵主动袭击敌人打击“还乡团”的情况下，压倒了邪气，“还乡团”大都钻到据点里，恶霸地主谁也不敢“倒算”。四区杨圈村两个不知死活的流氓当了蒋伪村长横行霸道，屡次警告不改，被枪毙了，这消息传出后，好多村庄的地主恶霸，不敢给敌人办事，有的当村长，有事也和群众商量。小仓口“还乡团”头子要“倒算”，但闻我干部民兵在附近活动，即不敢“倒算”了。四区群众街头巷尾无所顾忌的议论：“他们（指‘还乡团’和地主）说他的天晴了，我看还是咱的天晴”。现该地区群众都满充了抗蒋斗争的胜利信心，他们说：“蒋军、还乡团杀我们一个人，烧咱一家房，抢咱一家东西，就有千万人替咱报仇”。
