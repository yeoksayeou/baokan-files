[This report from our newspaper's Jilu Yu office on the 30th] The Xindian villagers in the Jining border area, with the militia blocking and attacking the traitor troops, saw farmers' association members distribute land. Xindian was a stronghold of resistance against Japan for eight years. The militia's weapons were confiscated by the Japanese invaders six times, but they resolutely re-armed themselves in less than a month. This time, when the traitor Wu Huawen occupied Jining, the 5,000 people of Xindian again took up broadswords and rifles, shouldering the vanguard task of the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. The traitor Wu repeatedly attempted to break through this tough barrier, but his attacks, time and again, resulted in fleeing in disarray. When land reform began, the Xindian village cadres said at the district-wide village cadres' meeting: "Although our village is fighting every other day, we cannot fall behind." When they returned to the village, they convened meetings of various groups, saying: "We are implementing land reform in our village, to return the land to its rightful owners. The members can rest assured that they can attend meetings at home to study the issues, while we, with the militia, will go to Xinzhaikou every day to block the traitor troops from Jining." In less than ten days, the land reform in the entire village was completed. The masses all said: "Although the situation in our village is tense, we still do what needs to be done."

　　民兵守卫农会分田辛店完成土地改革
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】济宁边沿区辛店村民兵堵击汉奸队，农会员分田地。辛店是坚持八年的抗战堡垒，民兵曾六次被日寇收枪，但不到一月又坚决的武装起来。这次汉奸吴化文占了济宁，辛店五千群众又拿起大刀钢枪，担当对蒋伪斗争的前哨任务，吴逆无数次的企图打开这个坚硬的壁垒，但三次五次的进攻，总是丢盔弃甲的逃窜。土地改革开始，辛店村干在全区村干会上说：“俺村虽然三天两头打仗，还不能落在后面。”他们回到村里，召开了各团体会议，说：“咱庄上实行土地改革，要叫土地回老家。会员们在家安心的开会研究，俺带着民兵天天到新闸口去堵住济宁的汉奸队伍。”不到十天工夫，全村土地改革完成，群众都说：“咱庄虽然情况紧张，该办啥的还是办啥。”
