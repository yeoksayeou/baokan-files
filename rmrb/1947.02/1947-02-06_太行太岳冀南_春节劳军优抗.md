Taihang, Taiyue, and Southern Hebei
Spring Festival Support for the Army and Preferential Treatment for Resistance
[Report from our Changzhi Office, 3rd] During the Lunar New Year, people from all walks of life in Taihang's urban and rural areas launched enthusiastic campaigns to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families. People in various places wrote letters to the front lines to congratulate them on their victories. Military families also wrote letters to their children on the front lines, reporting on the preferential treatment they received at home during the New Year. To this end, post offices in Taihang did not close during the New Year holidays to quickly convey the enthusiasm of the five million people in the region to the front lines. Special district and county governments organized慰问 (wèi wèn - comfort) groups, carrying large quantities of gifts and慰劳 (wèi láo - appreciation) funds to comfort hospitals in the rear. Merchants in Xingtai, Changzhi, Wu'an, Yangyi and other places donated large sums of money to support the army. Merchants in Licheng city and Shangyao alone donated more than 399,000 yuan. Factories donated large quantities of daily necessities such as towels, soap, socks, and gloves. Workers also donated large sums of money. For example, the first batch of慰劳 (wèi láo - appreciation) funds sent by workers from the Lucheng coal mine amounted to more than 203,000 yuan. Elementary school students from Licheng No. 1 and No. 2 High Schools donated 13,000 yuan. Gujiao Elementary School in Lingchuan also donated 38 new books to the soldiers on the front lines. The liberated peasants were even more enthusiastic in supporting the army. In addition to receiving a large number of vegetables and pork and mutton from the masses, the Cixian government also received more than 380,000 yuan. The masses in Huguan donated more than 410,000 yuan to support the army, while Xingtai County donated 5.44 million yuan. Military families eating dumplings during the New Year has become the minimum condition. The masses in Beizhang Village, Shahe, took out 80,000 yuan to slaughter pigs and sheep to send to military families. An old lady of a military family in Suobao Town, Shexian County, received five catties of white flour, two and a half catties of meat, vermicelli, salt, firewood, and Ji banknotes from the masses. She said, "I have never had such a rich year." The Xinhua Bookstore in Yetao Town, Wu'an, printed more than 2,000 copies of the 1947 lunar calendar comparison table and gave them to military families in the town. The Private Accounting School recently launched a campaign to support the army, donating a total of 30,520 yuan and writing letters of慰问 (wèi wèn - comfort), which have been forwarded to the front by this newspaper.
    [Report from our Taiyue Office, 3rd] Eleven units including the Taiyue Administrative Office and various organs and troops directly under the military region launched a campaign to comfort the wounded and sick during the Lunar New Year. They raised more than 50,000 yuan in Ji banknotes, 37 towels, as well as tooth powder, soap, pork and mutton, cigarettes, etc. They also organized comfort groups to carry the above-mentioned慰劳 (wèi láo - appreciation) items to the hospital in the freezing cold to comfort the wounded and sick comrades. The wounded and sick comrades were all moved and said, "Comrades are so concerned about us, we can only recover from our injuries quickly and go to the front line as soon as possible to repay everyone."
    [Report from our Weixian Office, 3rd] Southern Hebei enthusiastically supported the army during the New Year. Sixteen representatives from various agencies in the Fourth Military Sub-district and state-run shops and factories in Nangong carried 160,000 yuan to the Sub-district Health Department to comfort the wounded and sick. Political Commissar Xu and Deputy Commander Hu of the Seventh Military Sub-district visited the hospital to comfort the wounded and sick comrades, and gave each comrade a慰问 (wèi wèn - comfort) money of 500 yuan. When the recuperating members temporarily stayed in Wangqiao Village, Guantao, the village cadres quickly arranged them well. Elementary school students sent cigarettes, and women carried jars and pots to feed the wounded water with small spoons. They also organized dismantling and washing teams, self-defense teams, and care teams. The wounded comrades said with emotion: "After we recover from our injuries, we are determined to go to the front line again, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and defend everyone."
