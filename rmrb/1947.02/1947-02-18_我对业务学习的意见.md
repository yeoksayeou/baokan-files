　　My Opinions on Business Learning
　　·Yang Qianli·
　　I started out doing educational work. In several years of work, I thought other jobs were promising, but my own job was hopeless, so I looked down on business learning in my position. Precisely because I was not proficient in my work, and my work was not done well, I finally left educational work.
　　Later, I came to work in the finance department. Before long, I felt that financial work was also hopeless. However, upon hearing that many comrades in positions I considered very satisfactory also said that their work was hopeless, I realized that the saying "The other mountain looks taller from this mountain, but when you climb it, it's just as tall" makes a lot of sense. This gave me a great education in my thinking, made me feel at ease at work, and also gave me interest and confidence in business learning.
　　I think that to learn business, one must first establish a business ideology and find interest in learning business. When you are proficient in your business, you can give play to your creativity at work, and you can also adapt to the situation at the time and place in the implementation of policies.
　　Secondly, business learning should be combined with political learning. It should be clear in the concept that learning business is to serve politics; learning politics is to guide business. Any one-sided idea that politics is important and business is secondary, or that business is important and politics is secondary, is wrong.
　　Thirdly, business learning should not simply be learning regulations, but should be linked to the current work. In my auditing business learning, I only learned the regulations, so when solving problems, I would not consider the actual specific difficulties, and there was no way to establish an overall concept. Since the rectification of finance, I have found that there are many problems, which made me feel that simply mechanically implementing the system will not solve the problems. We must first understand the situation and actively solve the problems. On the other hand, in times of financial difficulties, we must make finance more open so that everyone understands our family property and everyone is responsible, so that the system can become a useful system.
　　Fourthly, we must always and everywhere humbly learn from others. Experience has proved that without learning from others, relying solely on one's own hard thinking, progress is very slow and one will take detours. At the same time, one should realize that what one does is only a small part, and of course, experience is limited. If one learns from others frequently, one will make rapid progress in business.

### 我对业务学习的意见

　　我对业务学习的意见
    ·杨谦离·
    我一开始是做教育工作的，在数年工作中，认为别的工作有出息，自己的工作没出息，所以对本岗位的业务学习看的就扯淡了。正因为自己不精通业务，工作没搞好，终于离开了教育工作。
    后来到了财政部门来工作，不久，又觉得财政工作也没出息，但听到有许多在我认为很满意的工作的同志，也同样提出他的工作没出息，至此，我才体会到，俗话说的“这山望见那山高，上去那山一般高”很有道理，给我思想上很大教育，使我工作安心，对业务学习也有了兴趣和信心。
    我觉得学习业务，首先要树立业务思想，从学习业务中找兴趣。当精通业务以后，在工作上能发挥自己的创造性，在政策的执行上，也能适合当时当地的情况了。
    其次，学习业务要与政治学习相互结合，在观念上应明确，学习业务就是为政治服务；学习政治是为了指导业务。任何政治重要业务次要，或业务重要政治次要的片面想法都是不对的。
    第三，业务学习不能单纯学条文，而要与当前的工作联系起来，我在审计业务的学习中，只学会了条文，所以解决问题时，就不会考虑到实际具体的困难，整体观念就无从树立，整顿财政以来，发现存在有许多问题，这才使我感到单纯的机械的执行制度是不会解决问题的，必须首先了解情况，主动的去解决问题，另一方面，在财政困难之际，我们要更加财政公开，使每个人都了解我们的家当，大家负责，这样制度才能变为有用的制度。
    第四，要随时随地虚心向别人学习，经验证明，不向别人学习，单凭自己的苦思，进步是很慢的，要走冤枉路。同时应认识自己做的事，只是一小部分，当然经验有限，若经常向人学习，在业务上就会飞速进步的。
