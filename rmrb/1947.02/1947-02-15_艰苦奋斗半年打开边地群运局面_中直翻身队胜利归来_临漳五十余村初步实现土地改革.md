    Half a Year of Arduous Struggle Opens Up Mass Movement in Border Areas:
    Central Directly Subordinate Turn-Over Team Returns Victoriously;
    Preliminary Land Reform Achieved in Fifty Villages in Linzhang
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Central Directly Subordinate Turn-Over Team, composed of cadres from various organs drawn by the Mass Movement Department of the Central Bureau, went to Linzhang, Handan, and other places last June to help the masses turn over, and returned victoriously before the new year. In the past six months, the team, undeterred by the constant harassment of the pseudo-bandit Guo Qing's plainclothes secret agents, worked tirelessly and won the enthusiastic support of the masses. Thanks to their arduous struggle, the mass movement to turn over has finally been opened up in the border areas. In this arduous struggle, comrades Zhao Naiguang from the Border Government and Zhang Tingjun from the Later Political Department gloriously sacrificed themselves for the peasant turn-over movement. The people of the border areas mourned them, calling them cadres sent by Chairman Mao and truly turning over for the suffering people. They unified their ideological understanding with the local cadres and supported the masses together, so that the land demands of more than 25,000 peasants in more than 50 villages along the Zhang River were met. It is estimated that 27,000 mu of land, more than 2,000 houses, 3,600 shi of grain, 146,000 jin of cotton, and materials worth more than 55 million yuan were recovered in 50 villages in the third and sixth districts of Linzhang, and extreme poverty was eliminated in most villages. According to statistics from 21 villages: Among 1,334 poor peasant households, except for 320 households, 76 percent of them were given 3 mu of land and rose to become middle peasants. Expanding the peasants' seizure of guns and weapons from feudal landlords in the struggle to arm themselves, the militia has developed more than three times than before the turn-over. The enthusiasm of the turn-over peasants to protect their land is unprecedentedly high. In the self-defense action against the invasion of Linzhang by the Chiang Kai-shek troops before the end of the year, it proved the high enthusiasm of the turn-over masses for patriotism and self-defense. When summing up the work of the team, the comrades of the turn-over team put forward the following points of experience: (1) In the border areas where the feudal ruling forces are strong, support again and again is the key to opening up the situation. (2) The combination of armed forces and mass movement is the central content of land reform in the border areas. (3) The combination of ideological enlightenment and action is the main link to fully mobilize the masses.

    艰苦奋斗半年打开边地群运局面
    中直翻身队胜利归来
    临漳五十余村初步实现土地改革
    【本报特讯】由中央局民运部抽调各机关干部组成的中直翻身队，去年六月分赴临漳邯郸等地帮助群众翻身，已于年前胜利返回。该队半年来，在伪匪郭清便衣特务的不断袭扰下，不避艰险的工作，取得群众的热烈拥护。由于他们的艰苦奋斗终于打开了边地群众翻身运动的局面。在这艰苦的奋斗中边府赵乃光同志、后政张廷钧同志先后为农民翻身运动而光荣牺牲，边地翻身人民悼念他们，称他们为毛主席派来的干部、真正为受苦人翻身。他们与当地干部统一了思想认识，协同一致为群众撑腰，使漳河沿岸五十余村二万五千余农民的土地要求得到满足。计临漳三、六区五十村，共收回土地二万七千余亩，房二千余间，粮食三千六百石，棉花一十四万六千余斤，物资折价五千五百余万元，大部村庄消灭了赤贫。据二十一个村统计：一千三百三十四户贫农，除三百二十户外，百分之七十六分得三亩土地，上升为中农。扩大农民从斗争中夺取封建地主枪支武装自己，民兵较翻身前发展三倍以上，翻身农民保田热情空前高涨，在年关前抗击蒋军侵犯临漳的自卫行动中，证明翻身群众爱国自卫积极性的高涨。翻身队同志在总结该队工作时，提出以下几点经验：（１）在封建统治势力强大的边地，撑腰再撑腰，是打开局面的关键。（２）武装与群运结合是边沿区土地改革的中心内容。（３）思想启发与行动结合，是充分发动群众的主要环节。
