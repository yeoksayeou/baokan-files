    Spring plowing is coming soon
    Kunshan organizes labor to support the military
    [Jilu Yu Daily News, 1st of this month] Spring plowing is just around the corner, and Kunshan is organizing labor to support the military. There are 4,000 families of military martyrs and dependents in the county. After the land reform, the land per family member is generally around six mu. If labor support for the military is not organized more rationally before spring plowing, it will greatly affect the production of military dependents and the masses. In the past, labor support for the military was generally carried out by temporary assignments, but this had great drawbacks, creating a temporary chaotic situation. During the busy farming season, military dependents would ask village cadres for labor and cattle, and the village cadres would be busy assigning people and cattle, causing chaos among the masses. Some people would rather plant ten more mu of land than provide temporary support to military dependents for a few days without a plan. Both sides suffered, production decreased, and the number of democratic plowing rotations increased. Now, Kunshan has implemented the following methods: (1) The land of military martyrs and dependents without labor is cultivated on their behalf, with 1.5 mu cultivated on behalf of each family member of workers and 2 mu cultivated on behalf of each family member of military personnel (except for widowers, widows, and the lonely). The surplus land is managed by themselves or by using semi-labor or hiring a few short-term workers. (2) The land cultivated on behalf of the military dependents is completely allocated to each household. (3) Households cultivating eight to twelve mu of military dependents' land are exempt from war service and equalized labor. (4) In villages with a particularly large number of military dependents, efforts are made to transfer them to smaller villages.
    [Jilu Yu Daily News, 3rd of this month] The masses and staff of various organs in the Jilu Yu area are very excited about the great victories repeatedly won by the frontline soldiers who shed blood in resistance against Chiang, and they have been donating money to support the military during the New Year. Two hundred and forty-nine staff members of the Sixth Special District Office donated a total of 430,000 yuan, and cook Song Yude donated 1,000 yuan. Although the Kaocheng militia battalion is working hard behind enemy lines, it has still launched a wave of frugality to support the military. The cadres and staff of the battalion headquarters and company headquarters donated more than 2,000 yuan in silver dollars. The political commissar and company commander of the 12th Company also led all comrades to establish a "quit smoking" association, donating the money saved from cigarettes to the front lines. Cadres in Guancheng County and district donated all their savings, and have now donated more than 110,000 yuan. The masses in various villages in the Third District of Shou Zhang and the masses in Nanfeng Li Tai Village donated two pigs and seventy catties of beef, as well as cigarettes, vermicelli sheets, vermicelli, and cabbage to the wounded.

    春耕快要到来
    昆山组织劳力优军
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】春耕眼看就来到，昆山组织劳动优军。该县的军工烈属有四千户，经过土地改革后，一般家属土地每人都在六亩左右，在春耕以前不把劳力优军组织得更合理，将大大应响到军属和群众的生产。过去劳力优军一般采取临时支差的方式，但这毛病很大，形成临时忙乱现象。农忙时军属找村干要夫要牛，村干忙着去派人派牛，群众也忙乱不堪，有些群众宁愿多种十亩地，不愿无计划去替军属支几天差。双方吃亏生产减低，活作的慢，民主轮的次数就更多。现在昆山实行了这样办法：（一）无劳动力的军烈工属的土地代耕，工属每人代耕亩半，军属代耕二亩，（鳏寡孤独者例外），多余的土地由他自己想办法或利用半劳力或觅几个短工。（二）所代耕之土地完全分配到每一花户。（三）每户代耕军属地八亩到十二亩者免战差平差。（四）军属特别多的村，则设法调剂到小庄去。
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】冀鲁豫区群众及各机关人员对前线将士流血抗蒋屡获大捷非常兴奋，新年纷纷献金劳军。六专署干杂人员二百四十九名共献金四十三万余元，炊事员宋玉德捐献一千元。考城民兵营虽处在敌后坚持工作，但仍掀起节约劳军热潮，营部和连部的干杂人员，共捐洋两千余元，十二连政委连长并领导全体同志成立“断烟”会，将所节省之烟钱捐献前线。观城县区干部把自己积余的钱都献出来，现已献金十一万多元。寿张三区各村群众和南峰李台村群众对伤员捐献猪两头牛肉七十斤及纸烟粉皮粉条白菜等。
