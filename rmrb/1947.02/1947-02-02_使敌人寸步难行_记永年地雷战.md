　　Make the Enemy Unable to Move an Inch
    A Record of the Landmine Warfare in Yongnian
    Explodes at a Touch
    The puppet troops in Yongnian city went to a residence in Shipengying to loot. Seeing the door was closed, they were about to push it open, but they suddenly remembered the landmines. So, they became cautious and went around to the window facing the street, then squeezed in to open the street door. He carefully watched his feet as he moved forward. As soon as the door cracked open, his head exploded like a watermelon, and the puppet soldier was killed. At this time, another puppet soldier found an old woman and forced her to test for landmines with a gun. The old woman refused. Just as she reached the courtyard, there was a loud bang, and the puppet soldier died in the thick black smoke. The puppet army officers, one wearing a black uniform and the other wearing a Japanese coat, strutted around and said, "We need to disarm the landmines!" They swaggered into the courtyard, drawing a circle around any fresh dirt, saying, "This is one." Finally, they pointed to another patch of fresh dirt and said, "This is definitely one too." As soon as the words left his mouth, the militiamen in the fortifications pulled a line, and with a loud bang, the three were blown to three different places. The one wearing the coat had his face blown off. The wounded puppet soldier ran into the street, trembling and saying, "These landmines are really strange; they explode at a touch."
    Escaping Over the Roofs
    When the puppet troops arrived at Shiguanying, about ten of them ran into a residence to loot. The two guys in front were covered in cloth blankets and burlap sacks, holding guns, each harboring a desire to get rich. As soon as they entered the door, they strutted in, shouting, "Old woman, old woman!" As they walked into the middle of the courtyard, there was a sudden bang, and black smoke filled the air. They never shouted for the old woman again. The seven or eight surviving puppet soldiers frantically screamed on the roof, "There are people inside, there are people inside!" They fired several shots from the roof into the rooms. The militiamen inside were gleefully laughing, waiting for the puppet soldiers, but they dared not come down into the courtyard. After screaming for a while, they scurried from the roofs.
    See Who is Truly Defeated
    On November 24th, five or six hundred puppet troops attacked Nan Hujia in three directions. The militiamen planted landmines and retreated. The puppet troops thought the militiamen were truly defeated, so they rushed straight into the village. Seven or eight of them entered a residence to search for things. When they entered the west room, a landmine at the door exploded. Heading toward the north room, two hand grenades exploded on the door one after the other. One puppet soldier was killed, and two were seriously injured. The others who suffered minor injuries dared not stand in the courtyard and dared not go through the street door. Finally, they pushed down the wall and ran out through a narrow alley to the east.
    Make Them Unable to Move an Inch
    On November 26th, the traitor Tie Motou led more than three hundred men out of the city, one group went to Nan Hujia again. The militiamen hurried to plant landmines. While they were planting, they heard a commotion on the street. Just as they finished planting, they heard the sound of someone trying to force the door open. The militiamen went through the back door. Not far away, they heard a loud "bang!" Several puppet bandits perished along with the explosion. Other puppet bandits thought there were no more landmines, so they aggressively went to the north room. A landmine on the door of the north room exploded again. Another group of puppet soldiers ran into the room and saw a lacquered table with two drawers. Thinking there must be good things inside, he pulled, and two hand grenades exploded. Many puppet soldiers suffered serious injuries. After the enemy left, the militiamen happily said, "Let's fill the village with mines, so the sons of bitches can't move an inch!"

　　使敌人寸步难行
    记永年地雷战
    一指就响
    永年城内伪军到石篷营一个宅子里去抢东西，一见门关着，正打主意去推，忽想起地雷来，他便多了个心眼，绕到临街的窗子前钻进去开街门，他小心谨慎地看着脚下向前走去；门刚一闪缝，头上像一个西瓜开了花，这个伪军一命鸣呼了。这时另一伪军找了个老太太，用枪逼着她去试地雷，老太太不去，刚到院里，轰的一声，伪军又死在浓黑的烟雾中。伪军的军官一个穿着黑军装，一个穿着日本大衣，装腔作势的说：“要起地雷！”他们大摇大摆的走进院里，看见新土就划个圈，连说：“这是一个。”最后又指着一块新土说：“这保险也是一个。”话音刚落，民兵在工事里一拉线，一声巨响，三人炸到三处，穿大衣的脸都没有了，受伤的伪军跑到街里，战战兢兢的说：“这地雷真怪，一指就响。”
    越房而逃
    伪军到了石官营，有十来个跑到一处宅子里抢东西，前边二个家伙身上披着布被、麻包，手里持着枪，每人抱着一颗发财的心。一进门就得意洋洋的边走边喊：“老太太，老太太！”走到院的当中，霹雳一声，黑烟弥漫，再也不喊老太太了。七八个未死的伪军急的在房上恐慌狂叫：“里边有人，里边有人”。从房上向房里打了几枪，民兵们在房里却得意的笑着，等着伪军，可是他们那里敢下来院，狂叫了几声就从房上窜了。
    看谁真败了
    十一月廿四日，伪军五六百，三路进攻南胡驾，民兵埋好地雷转移了。伪军以为民兵当真败了，便直扑该村。有七、八个人进一个宅子里搜索东西，进西屋时，门上雷响了，向北房去，门上又连响了两个手榴弹，一个伪军被炸死，两个带了重伤，其他带彩的人不敢在院里站脚，又不敢在街门上走，最后朝东一个狭小的夹道里把墙推倒跑出去。
    叫他寸步难行
    十一月二十六日，汉奸铁磨头，带了三百多人出城，一股又去南胡驾，民兵赶紧下地雷，正下着，听着街上乱哄哄的；刚下好，听着有拨门的声音，民兵从后门走去，走不远，听着“轰”的一声响了，几个伪匪随着响声同归于尽。其他伪匪以为没有地雷了，凶凶的到了北屋，北屋门上雷又响了。另一群伪军跑到屋里，见一个油漆的桌子上面有两个抽屈，他想里面一定有好东西，一拉，两个手榴弹开了花，好多伪军带了重伤。敌人走后，民兵们高兴的说：“咱们把村上埋满雷，叫狗娘养的寸步难行”。（冀南分社）
