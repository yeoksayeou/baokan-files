　　Chiang Planes Bomb Relief Supplies
    Hansen et al. Telegraph UNRRA to Protest

    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 25th dispatch] Chiang's planes have continuously bombed and strafed the Yellow River's former course dikes, ferries, and UNRRA relief supplies for residents of the riverbed for days. UNRRA representative Hansen and Liberated Area representative Wang Xiaoyi have telegraphed UNRRA's Henan branch and UNRRA Shanghai's General Edgerton to lodge a serious protest. The telegram stated: "Since we arrived in Zhangqiu, Guofang (Nationalist) planes have continued to indiscriminately bomb and strafe this area along the Yellow River dike and ferries. Transportation teams carrying funds to relieve residents of the riverbed have also become targets of air raids. Pedestrians on the dike have been killed, dike repair materials have been destroyed, and trucks marked with (CHT) transporting relief supplies have been strafed and burned. UNRRA personnel have been blocked and unable to cross the river. While the Executive Headquarters specifically ordered to come to this area to carry out dike repair and resident relief work and suggested that local people build boats, the Kuomintang planes are simultaneously and actively attacking and destroying in the same area. We believe this is an extremely brutal and unreasonable act and lodge a serious protest. Due to the above reasons, work has had to be suspended and will return to Kaifeng after the ferry is repaired."

　　蒋机轰炸救济物资
    韩森等电联总抗议
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】蒋机连日轰炸扫射黄河故道堤坝渡口及联总救济河床居民物资，联总代表韩森、解放区代表王笑一，特电联总河南分署和上海联总艾格顿将军，提出严重抗议。电称：自我们抵张秋后国方飞机一直继续来此区域沿黄河大堤及渡口滥施轰炸与扫射，运输救济河床居民款项之运输队亦成为空袭之目标。堤上行人被打死，复堤材料被炸毁，饰有标帜（ＣＨＴ）装运救济物资之卡车亦被扫射焚毁，联总行总人员被阻隔不能渡河。行总一方面特令前来此区域举行复堤及救济居民工作，并建议地方人民建筑船只，一方面国民党飞机即在同时同地如此积极袭击破坏。我们认为此乃极为惨暴无理行为，特提出严重抗议。由于上述原因工作只得暂停，在渡船修复后即返开封。
