Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 8th: According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch of February 7th, citing the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, Chongqing students held a propaganda movement against U.S. military atrocities. While staging the play "U.S. Military Atrocities" in the suburbs of Chongqing, over two hundred "masses" suddenly broke in and attacked, seriously injuring three students and lightly injuring more than ten. Student groups have lodged a serious protest with the authorities, demanding punishment for the instigating groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 8th: According to delayed Chengdu newspaper reports, after students from Sichuan University, Huaxi University, and other schools in Chengdu held a protest parade against U.S. military atrocities in Peiping on the 5th of last month, students from the West China Union High School also went on strike on the 6th and paraded again, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops. On the 5th, when the students held a demonstration, they were subjected to planned sabotage by secret agents. On that day, two students who were writing slogans disappeared. After they were discovered, the masses poured into the police station to question them. Only after the police chief came out to guarantee the release of the missing students did the masses disperse. After the demonstration, students from various schools appointed representatives and began to organize a joint association to protest U.S. military atrocities. The Chengdu Women's Federation and the Sichuan branch of the Democratic League also issued declarations, firmly demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 9th: Peiping dispatch: The U.S. military court's trial of the Peiping U.S. military's rape of Peking University student Shen Chong has concluded on January 22nd, declaring the principal offender, Pierson, William, guilty of rape. On February 1st, the court also declared the accessory, Pritchard, guilty of accessory. However, it is said that the sentence must await the approval of the U.S. Secretary of the Navy before it can be announced. Various circles here generally believe that this trial by the U.S. military court is a revival of U.S. imperialism's consular jurisdiction in China, and is itself illegal. The Peiping Student Union has recently issued a statement denying its validity and demanding a retrial to safeguard the dignity of the Chinese nation.

    北平学联要求重审沈案
    【新华社延安八日电】据合众社上海七日电引大公报重庆讯称：重庆学生举行反对美军暴行宣传运动，而在重庆近郊演出“美军暴行”一剧时，突有二百以上的“群众”闯入袭击，重伤学生三名，轻伤在十名以上，学生团体已向当局提出严重抗议，要求惩处启事团体。
    【新华社延安八日电】据迟到的成都报纸消息，成都川大、华大等校学生于上月五日举行抗议北平美军暴行游行示威后，华西协合高中学生亦于六日罢考，再度游行，要求美军撤退。五日学生举行示威时，曾遭特务有计划的破坏，是日有二名写标语的学生失踪，被发觉后，群众涌入警局提出质问，直至警局局长出来担保释放失踪学生后，群众始散。示威后各校学生都推出代表，着手进行组织抗议美军暴行联合会。成都妇联及民盟四川支部亦发表宣言，坚决要求美军退出中国。
    【新华社延安九日电】北平讯：美军法庭审讯北平美军强奸北大女生沈崇暴行结果已于一月二十二日宣告，被告正凶皮尔逊，威廉姆所犯之强奸罪行成立。二月一日该法庭又宣告被告帮凶普利查德所犯帮凶罪亦告成立。但据称：尚须等待美国海军部长批准才能公布罪刑。此间各界咸认美军法庭之是项审判乃复活了美帝国主义在华的领事裁判权，其本身即属非法。北平学联近已声明否认其效力，要求予以重审，以维护中华民族尊严。
