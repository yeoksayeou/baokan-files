　　General Liu Bocheng Sends a Personal Letter of Commendation to Yongxing Printing Bureau
　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After the manuscript of "Combined Tactics," a monumental work on Soviet military science translated by the authoritative military scholar General Liu Bocheng, was delivered to the Yongxing Printing Bureau, all the workers in the factory felt excited, believing that this was another major contribution by General Liu to the patriotic self-defense war. Therefore, all personnel in the bureau worked extra hard to typeset and print it, in order to express their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines. It has now been printed in large quantities and transported to the front lines. The printing of the book is excellent. On the 16th, General Liu personally sent a letter to Manager Wang of the bureau and all the personnel to express his gratitude, saying: "The 'Combined Tactics' you printed this time is very clear in both the text and the illustrations. There are few typos, and the binding is also very good. I am very satisfied after reading it. In short, this time you have all worked hard and made the greatest effort to complete this book, which is a great contribution to the self-defense war. I hope you will carry forward this working spirit and carry it forward, so that printing technology can be further improved to meet the victory of the counter-offensive." On the 19th, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of the bureau's personnel in supporting the front lines, specially allocated 40,000 yuan as a reward.
