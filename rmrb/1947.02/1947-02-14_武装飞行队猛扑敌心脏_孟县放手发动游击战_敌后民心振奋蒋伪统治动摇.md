[This report from the Taiyue area is dated the 9th] (Delayed) Since Meng County unleashed guerrilla warfare, it has opened up a guerrilla zone in the county. On the night of January 13th, the county's independent battalion, combined with the Ji and Meng militias, totaling several hundred people, organized a short, sharp, and highly mobile "flying squad" and pounced on Tianzhang and Qinglonggou, near the enemy's heart, the county seat; capturing more than ten counter-settlement elements alive; and distributing and posting leaflets and slogans. The masses, when awakened, realized it was the Eighth Route Army. They rushed out to welcome them, eagerly reading the propaganda. At the same time, the squad split into two groups for rapid advances. One group ambushed Zhang Liancun, scattering Zhang Bohua's company of more than eighty men in disarray. Some didn't even have time to put on their pants before jumping into the river to escape. The other group fiercely attacked Zhaocun. The enemy fled in panic, and were ambushed by us next to the village. The two groups together killed or wounded more than ten enemies. The militia backbone team, taking advantage of the combat cover, convened mass meetings in villages near Jiyuan, publicizing current events and the land reform in Jiyuan, calling on the local masses to rise up in the anti-"counter-settlement" struggle. They also started wildfires everywhere, with flames stretching for dozens of miles, terrifying the enemy in the county seat all night long, preventing them from daring to come out. This offensive greatly boosted the morale of the people behind enemy lines, with fifteen "bao" (villages) refusing to maintain order for the enemy, paving the way for future work in the guerrilla zone.

Meng County's guerrilla warfare has achieved such results, mainly due to four experiences: (1) The first is the issue of unleashing the masses. After Meng County was occupied by the enemy, our militia and guerrilla teams could only rely on Qinyang and Jiyuan to conduct large-scale forays into Meng County. Therefore, the leadership had more concerns and initially did not dare to boldly let the militia and guerrilla teams go out and operate. The militiamen were very enthusiastic about defending their homes and did not agree with this restrictive policy. The Third District first allowed the militia to act freely, and they attacked Yudao several times, shaking the enemy's rule and suppressing the arrogance of the local bullies involved in counter-settlement. (2) Correctly implement the policy of leniency combined with suppression, stressing both aspects. First, specifically explain to cadres how to implement the policy, and then let everyone boldly do it. Inevitably, there will be deviations in some places at the beginning, but they can be rectified through continuous struggle. It is unrealistic to expect the policy to be perfectly implemented from the start. Therefore, in implementing the policy, one should not be too restrictive at the beginning, so as not to limit the development of guerrilla warfare. Continuous research should be conducted during the implementation process based on the situation. (3) Open up the situation militarily, quickly restore political power, and consolidate the gained positions.

    武装飞行队猛扑敌心脏
    孟县放手发动游击战
    敌后民心振奋蒋伪统治动摇
    【本报太岳九日电】（迟到）孟县放手发动游击战争以来，已打开该县游击区的局面。一月十三日夜，县独立营结合济、孟民兵共数百人组织短小精干的飞行队，猛扑敌心脏城关附近的田丈、清龙沟；活捉倒算分子十余人；并散发张贴传单标语。群众惊醒时才知道是八路军。急忙起来迎接，争着宣读宣传品。同时该队又分两路飞行进军，一路偷袭张莲村，打的张伯华部一个中队八十余人落花流水。有些连裤子都穿不及跳河逃了。一路猛袭昭和村，敌仓惶逃出，又在村旁遭我伏击。两路共毙伤敌十余名。民兵基干队等趁作战掩护，在济源附近村庄召开群众大会，宣传时事及济源的土地改革，号召当地群众起来作反“倒算”斗争。又四处点起野火，几十里地一片火光，使城关敌人彻夜受惊，不敢出来。这次攻势大大兴奋了敌后民心，已有十五个保不再维持敌人，给今后游击区工作开辟了一条道路。
    孟县游击战争获得这样的成绩，主要有四个经验：（一）首先是放手问题。孟县被敌侵占后，我民兵游击队只能依托沁阳、济源向孟县作大踏步的进出活动，因此领导上顾虑问题较多，开始不敢大胆让民兵游击队出去活动。民兵们在保卫家乡热情很高不同意这种不放手政策。三区首先放手让民兵干，他们曾几次袭击禹导。动摇了敌人统治，镇压了恶霸倒算气焰。（二）正确执行宽大政策，镇压争取并重先对干部具体说明如何执行政策，然后让大家大胆去干。开始不免有出入地方，但能在不断斗争中加以贯彻。不能想像政策执行一入手就四方四正。因此在执行政策上，开始时不能过于拘束，以免限制游击战争的开展。应在执行过程中根据情况不断进行研究。（三）在军事上打开局面，迅速恢复政权，巩固已得阵地。
