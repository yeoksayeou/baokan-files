Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to Chongqing newspapers, the atrocities of rape by American soldiers are happening everywhere. US Marines openly dragged Chinese women to US military camps, raped them for several days before releasing them. The wife of a tofu shop owner in Chuqimen was taken away by American soldiers in a jeep and went missing for eight days before being sent back. Her husband told reporters that many women in the Chuqimen area had been taken away and humiliated. One day at a fair in Muerchang, Jiangbei, American soldiers suddenly started grabbing women, causing the women attending the fair to run all over the street. Some who escaped to the fields were still not spared. As a result, a female farmer and a female teacher were taken away and raped for several days before being driven out by car.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, at noon on the 3rd of last month, an American military jeep sped past the entrance of the "Peace Daily" on Shangqing Temple Road in Chongqing, knocking down a 15 or 16-year-old boy, who was seriously injured and immediately sent to the hospital. On the 5th, Chengdu American military jeep number 6853 was recklessly driving inside the imperial city, driving directly onto the sidewalk, resulting in several deaths. At the time, the American soldiers continued driving regardless, arousing the indignation of a young man who jumped onto the jeep and grabbed the American soldier.

    【新华社延安三日电】据重庆报纸载称：美军强奸暴行到处发生。美陆战队将中国妇女公开拉到美兵营强奸几天才放回。储奇门某豆腐房老板娘被美军用吉普拉去，失踪八天后才送回来。据她的丈夫告记者，储奇门区一带被拉去受辱的甚多。江北木耳场一天逢场时突有美军拉女人，把赶场的妇女赶得满街跑；有逃至田野者，仍不能幸免，结果一农妇及妇女教员被拉去强奸几天后，用车送出来。
