How to Untie Knots?

　　In addition to the method of "looking for it where you lost it" created by Xia Zhuang (see page 2 of this newspaper on January 19th), the old liberated area of ​​Pingshun has the experience of "dredging and reconciling" in Huyao Village, District 6, etc., in adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses. It is introduced as follows for reference in various places:

　　"Dredging and reconciling" first involves discovering the problem, understanding what problems exist between cadres and the masses, and what knots have formed. There are two ways to do this:

　　The first is to conduct in-depth investigations among the masses. For example, the Liu family went deep into mountain villages and talked with the masses, discovering cadres sheltering landlords and problems with their work style. Most poor peasants in Shibutou reflected that no matter how active they were, it was useless, without houses or land, and the cadres had arranged everything properly. The masses in Xingcheng reflected that cadres closed the door to divide the fruits of victory during the movement last year, and they were no longer active! Wang Qu discovered that people on the east and west streets were engaging in sectarianism, and talks were divided into factions. The second is to discover problems from the internal self-criticism of cadres. Huyao Village in District 6 first convened a meeting of cadres and activists to examine their attitude towards the masses, proposing that the masses are water and we are fish, and fish cannot be raised without water. This enlightened cadres to reflect and discover problems.

　　After the problem is discovered, the next step is to guide the cadres to make profound self-criticism and encourage the masses to offer opinions based on the problem discovered. On the cadre side: first break through the ideological barrier of not daring to speak out, fearing that the masses' struggle will be humiliating. For example, Xu Yongfu, chairman of the Black Tiger Farmers' Association, saw that the masses were very energetic and thought that they would definitely try to bring him down; there were also some cadres who resisted ideologically, such as the Wang Qu cadres who said that this was the fate of being a cadre. At this time, it is necessary to dispel their concerns and guide them well. For example, Black Tiger suggested that as long as the self-criticism is good, and the transformation is good in the future, the masses will definitely support them. Shibutou suggested that cadres should wash their faces every day to make progress. The second is to guide cadres to recall past history. For example, Tang Qilin, the village chief of Wang Qu Village, reflected on his past as a hired worker. Now that he is the village chief, he should not forget the pain after the wound has healed, forget the suffering of the masses, and ignore the masses who have not been emancipated. The village chief of Chongyan said: I used to be a poor man too, but now that I am a cadre, I have forgotten the poor masses in the mountain villages, and sometimes I stare at them and judge them unfairly. Under this kind of process, many cadres were moved to tears, and they all resolved to correct themselves, lead the masses to emancipate themselves, and make self-criticism to the masses face to face.

　　On the side of the masses: the main thing is to put forward all opinions. However, because the cadres' work style is not good, the masses are afraid of giving opinions to the cadres and being retaliated against, so the masses' concerns must be dispelled before they will speak their minds. Black Tiger proposed to guarantee that cadres would not retaliate and used the actual examples of village cadres making self-criticism in the county and district to educate the masses. After Wang Qu understood the concerns of the masses, they proposed that cadres and the masses are one family, and should be frank with each other and say whatever they have to say. In this way, the masses can talk about their dissatisfaction with the cadres. For example, the masses in Wang Qu Village and mountain villages said that they were responsible for dispatching labor, but not for sharing the fruits of victory. The masses in Anyang said that the good land was taken by the cadres, and everyone was not emancipated. In this situation, if the guidance is not good, all hatred will be concentrated on the cadres. For example, the Black Tiger masses said that the root of poverty is rooted in the landlords, and now that the landlords have collapsed, the cadres are the fine roots. For another example, after the masses in Nanzhuanggou said about the political director Guo Keze's sheltering of landlords and selfishness, the masses resolutely demanded that he be dismissed and struggled against. Therefore, it is necessary to guide the masses to make a turn and correctly understand the contributions of the cadres and the reasons why they have not been emancipated. When the masses in Nanzhuanggou were opposed to the cadres, they explained it in the people's school, but it did not work, so they went deep into the masses and educated the activists, explaining that cadres have shortcomings and achievements, and used the fact that the village had not been emancipated due to disunity to educate them. As a result, they all turned around and said that if Keze had not led everyone to fight the landlords in 1944, everyone would not have been emancipated. Sheltering landlords was deceived by the landlords, and it was still the landlords who were making trouble, and hatred immediately turned to the landlords. In this way, after the masses recognize the reasons why they have not been emancipated and the achievements of the cadres, the cadres and the masses can further make self-criticism together, and both sides can communicate their ideas.

　　After the above two steps are done well, the next step is for cadres and the masses to work together to carry out reconciliation work, that is, cadres make self-criticism and the masses make proposals. When carrying out this work, it must be after the cadres and the masses have a certain degree of awareness, the cadres are willing to lead the masses to emancipate themselves, and the masses recognize that the cadres and the masses are one family. On the basis of mutual awareness, the relationship will be straightened out. The masses in Huyao said: The cadres are telling the truth, no matter what, we are all one family. Old man Chen Lvcheng said: Cadres will correct their bad attitudes, and ideologically they are one family with us. Both sides became intimate. (Wang Julin)

### 怎样解圪瘩？

　　怎样解圪瘩？
    平顺老区调整干部与群众关系经验，除了下庄创造“那里丢那里找”办法之外（见一月十九日本报二版）尚有六区虎窑等村“打通弄和”的经验，兹介绍如下，供各地参考：
    “打通弄和”首先是发现问题，了解干部与群众间存在着什么问题，结下什么圪瘩。在做法上有以下两种：
    第一是深入群众中进行调查，如刘家深入山庄窝铺和群众圪拉中，发现干部包庇地主与作风问题。石埠头大部分贫农反映，不管怎样积极也不顶事，没房没地，干部都打叠合适了。杏城群众反映，去年运动干部关门分果实，不积极啦！王曲发现东西街闹宗派，谈话分圪堆。其次从干部内部检讨中发现问题。六区虎窑村首先召开干部积极分子会议，检讨对群众态度，提出群众是水、我们是鱼，没有水是养不住鱼的，这样启发干部反省，发现问题。
    问题发现以后，就针对发现的问题，诱导干部作深刻的检讨及鼓励群众提意见。在干部方面：首先打破思想上存在不敢往外说，怕群众斗争丢人。如黑虎农会主席徐永福看见群众劲很大，以为非把咱打击下去不行；还有一部分干部，在思想上抵抗，如王曲干部说，当干部就这个下场。这时必须解除顾虑，很好引导。如黑虎提出只要反省的好，以后转变好、群众一定会拥护。石埠头提出干部要天天洗脸，才能进步。其次是引导干部回忆过去的历史，如王曲村长唐其林，反省自己过去当雇工，现在当了村长，不该好了疮疤忘了疼，忘了群众的痛苦，不管群众没翻身。崇岩村长说：过去我也是个穷人，现在当了干部忘了山庄贫苦群众，有时把眼一瞪，还评判群众不对。在这样进行下，许多干部都感动的落泪，都决心改正，领导群众翻身，向群众当面检讨。
    在群众方面：主要是有意见都提出来。但由于干部作风不好，群众怕给干部提意见，记下仇，所以必须把群众顾虑解除之后，群众才会把心事话谈出来。黑虎提出保证干部不报复并拿上村干部在县区反省的实际例子来教育群众。王曲了解群众心事以后，提出干部群众是一家人，应该当面锣对面鼓，有啥说啥。这样群众对干部不满意的事情，都能谈出来。如王曲村、山庄的群众说，支差有咱，分果实没咱，安阳群众说，好地都让干部要了，大家没翻了身。在这种情况下，如果引导不好，就会把全部仇恨集中在干部身上，如黑虎群众说穷根扎在地主身上，现在地主垮了干部就是毛根。又如南庄沟群众把政治主任郭科则的包庇地主，自私自利的事情，说出以后，群众坚决要求要罢免斗争。所以必须引导群众转弯子，正确认识干部的功劳与自己没翻身原因。南庄沟群众对干部对立时，在民校解释不成，就深入群众并教育积极分子，说明干部有缺点也有成绩，并拿上村里没翻身是吃了不团结的亏来教育，结果都转过来了，都说不是科则领导大家四四年向地主斗争，大家也不会翻了身，包庇地主是上了地主当，还是地主捣鬼，仇恨马上转到地主身上。这样使群众认清自己没翻身的原因和干部的功绩以后，进一步干部与群众就可以到一块检讨，双方把话说通。
    上两步做好以后，再进一步就是干部与群众到一块，进行和的工作，就是干部检讨群众提议，在进行这工作时，必须要在干部与群众有一定觉悟以后，干部愿意领导群众翻身，群众认清干部群众是一家人，在双方觉悟的基础上，关系就会弄通。虎窑群众说：干部都说的实话，不管怎样都是一家人。陈率成老汉说：干部态度不好会改正，思想上和咱是一家人。双方都亲热起来。（王巨林）
