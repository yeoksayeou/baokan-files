　　“Overturning Starts with Overturning the Mind”
    Shè County Mobilizes Backwardness, Experiences and Insights

    In the in-depth rent reduction and anti-usury campaign in Shè County, the leadership emphasized: "The rent reduction movement in the old liberated areas must be thorough and meticulous. We must concentrate our efforts and completely eliminate landlords, the extremely poor, and backwardness." In practice, they created some methods to enlighten backward peasants.

    I.  Pour Out Grievances: Cadres Take the Lead by Example, Mobilizing the Whole Family to Pour Out Grievances. For example, the vice chairman of the trade union mobilized his 67-year-old father, saying, "People are overturning themselves by pouring out their grievances. Are you going to do it or not? Does our family have grievances or not?" This reminded his father that he was related to Li Bǐngchāng. During the Tóngzhì reign, he borrowed 50 strings of cash from him. During the Guāngxù reign, he repaid a portion, paying interest every year, but he still owed interest every year, eventually owing 10 strings of cash. Even after paying it off, the contract was never returned." The mute in Zhàn'āo, unable to speak, used hand gestures to tell of the suffering caused by the landlord's oppression.

    II. Combining Visits, Exhibitions, and Propaganda to Arouse Bitterness. The method used by activists in Běigāng to mobilize women was not to say they were holding a meeting, but to say they were going to "visit" the home of landlord Li Bǐngchāng (the Li family had been wealthy for five generations, and their home was very lavish; in the past, poor people could not even enter his home). The cadres asked the women who came to visit, "Have you ever been to his house before? Have you ever slept under such good quilts? Have you ever used such fine plates and bowls?" The women, filled with envy, said directly, "Who would dare to go to his door in the past?" This aroused the bitterness of the poor. Many women automatically requested to join the peasant association to make revolution. Nánguōkǒu used the method of organizing a "Turning-Over Pavilion" to turn the village inside out in terms of landlords oppressing poor people. Such things as the landlord forcing poor people to hang themselves and children starving to death were made into model paintings and displayed. Qiū Rénzǐ's wife cried as soon as she went inside. She remembered that her man had been a farmhand for the landlord for fourteen years, and the suffering the whole family had endured was just like the models. She cried, and her cries influenced others to cry as well, and they were able to trace out the root of their poverty.

    III. Use Examples to Break Down Superstition about Fate and Ideas of "Changing Heavens." For example, in Dōngdòuzhuāng there were more than 50 poor old men who had never participated in struggle and did not want the fruit of the land distributed to them, saying, "Ill-gotten gains don't make a poor man rich. It's better to stick to what you have." Later, they were guided to discuss, "Where does fate come from?" Liú Déyì, who was an extremely poor peasant who had turned himself around, introduced his experience of turning himself around, how he was poor in the past, but is now rich. Did he not have fate in the past, and now has fate? This enlightened an old man who sold candied haws, who realized that he had been talking about fate his whole life, but had never turned himself around. This time, he was given a good quilt and a good robe. Someone said, "If I cover myself with a good quilt tonight and die, that is my poor fate; otherwise, it is not fate." The old man's thinking was cleared up, and other honest peasants said, "If you dare to take it, I dare to take it too." As this story spread, many people came to understand that fate was originally a lie. (Jú Xiāng)

　　“翻身先翻心”
    涉县发动落后经验点滴
    涉县在深入查减中，领导上强调提出：“老区的查减运动必须深入与细致，要集中精力，彻底把地主、赤贫、落后消灭完”。在执行中创造了一些启发落后农民的办法。
    一、诉痛苦，干部以身作则，发动全家诉苦。如工会副主席动员六十七岁的父亲说：“人家翻身诉痛苦的，你翻不翻？咱家有苦没苦？”提醒了他父亲，想起和李秉昌是亲戚，同治年间揭他五十吊钱，光绪十年还了一部，年年还利，还是年年欠利，最后欠到十吊钱，还清了至今不给抽文约。”占凹哑吧不会说话，用手比划，诉说地主欺压他的痛苦。
    二、一面参观，一面展览，一面宣传引起苦来。北岗积极分子动员妇女的办法是不说开会，说到地主李秉昌家去串串（李系五辈财主，家里非常阔气，过去穷人根本不能进他的家门）。干部向来参观的妇女问：“你来过人家家没有？盖过这样好的被子吗？用过这样细盘子细碗吗？”眼气的妇女直说：“过去谁敢上人家门？”这样就引起穷人的苦来，许多妇女自动要求参加农会闹翻身。南郭口用组织翻身馆的办法把村子里地主压迫穷人的事，如用地主逼的穷人上吊孩子饿死等事实，搞成模型画像展览。邱仁子的老婆进去一看就哭，想起他男人给地主住十四年长工，一家人所受的痛苦，就和模型一样，她哭起来，影响别人也哭起来，追出了穷根。
    三、用实例打破命运迷信和变天思想。如东豆庄有五十多个穷苦老汉，从没参加过斗争，分给果实也不要，他们说：“外财不富命穷人，守本分就好。”后来引导他们讨论：“命是从那里来的？”刘德益是赤贫翻身的，便介绍了自己翻身经过，过去穷，现在富，难道过去没命现在有命吗？启发了卖麻糖的老汉，想到自己一辈子讲命，却没翻了身，这次分了一个好盖的，好袍子，有的说：“今天晚上盖上好被子，烧死了就是命穷，否则不是命。”老汉思想通了，别的老实农民说：“你敢要，我也敢要。”这样的事情传开来，许多人都弄通了命运原是骗人的。（菊香）
