    【Report from This Newspaper in Taihang】 Winter production in Taihang has been underway for two months. In order to implement and complete the plan, the Second and Third Special Districts have instructed all subordinate counties to inspect the situation of winter production. The following is a brief summary: 1. Inspect the production plan, production scale, and achieved production results. According to existing materials, He Shun plans to produce more than 100 million yuan this winter, but from the perspective of production organization and scale, the production plan is greater than the concrete results, while Ping Shun and Yu She have production results exceeding the production plan. Experience has proven that the district and county plans must be consistent with the production actions of the districts and villages; only in this way can we avoid starvation and prevent the plan from failing. 2. There are two kinds of thinking in winter production. One is to compensate for the frost damage in the autumn harvest, and the other is to top up one season's harvest to ensure "three parts cultivation, one part surplus." The former is prone to complacency and should be overcome, while the latter mostly uses the production income to purchase production tools, preparing for this year's large-scale production and should be promoted. Ping Shun’s Shannan Di village moved towards a production upsurge after correcting this. 3. Solve the contradiction between the personal production of village cadres and leading everyone. According to the experience of Li Dong Yangguan: cadres should be assigned tasks, with one person leading a department and participating in the production of that department. 4. Others, such as Yuci Border Area and Li Cheng Beiliu Village, found work to do from "nothing to do"; their experience should be drawn upon during the inspection so as to be promoted throughout the area.

    【Report from This Newspaper in Taihang】In order to universally improve technology and promote special crops, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Second Special District of Taihang has opened an agricultural technology training class. The class is located in Dongguan, Zuoquan, and is scheduled to start on February 16. It will train production assistants from various counties and districts, as well as some labor heroes, for a period of 20 days. After the training, they will return to their respective areas to carry out extensive publicity and run small-scale technical training in various villages, requiring cadres and the masses to universally improve technology and strengthen technical leadership. The content focuses on special crops, promoting cultivation, fertilization, and cultivation techniques, and improving varieties, all of which will be subject to practical experiments and specimen demonstrations.

    为今年大生产作准备
    太行二三专署检查冬季生产
    二专农林局设技术训练班
    【本报太行讯】太行冬季生产已进行两月。为贯彻完成计划，二、三两专署均指出所属各县，检查冬季生产情形。略为：一、检查生产计划、生产规模与已得的生产成绩。据现有材料，和顺今冬要生产一万万余元，但从生产组织、规模看，是生产计划大于具体成果，而平顺榆社则是生产成果超过生产计划。经验证明，区县计划必须与区、村计划生产行动吻合，如能生产才不致矣饿。计划才不致落空。二、冬季生产中有两种思想。一是补偿秋收时的风霜减成，一是顶一季收成，保证耕三余一，前者容易自满应克服，后者则多是以生产所得购置生产工具，为今年大生产作准备应发扬。平顺山南底村是这样改正后走向生产热潮的。三、解决村干部个人生产和领导大家的矛盾。据黎东阳关的经验是：干部分工，一人领导一个部门并参加该部门生产。四、其他如榆次边地、黎城北流村从“没啥干”中找出活计；检查时应吸取其经验，以便向全区推广。（兴华）
    【本报太行讯】为普遍提高技术，推广特种作物，太行二专署农林局，开设农业技术训练班。该班设左权东关，定二月十六日开学。训练各县区生产助理员，部分劳动英雄等，时间二十天，训练后回各地展开广泛宣传，开办各村小型技术训练，要求干部、群众普遍提高技术，加强技术领导。内容着重特种作物，推广耕作、施肥、栽培技术，改良品种等，均作实习试验，和标本示范。（法彰）
