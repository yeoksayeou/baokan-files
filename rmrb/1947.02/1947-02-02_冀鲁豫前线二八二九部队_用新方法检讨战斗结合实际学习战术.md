[Special Dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Front's 2829 Unit used new methods to review the Liaocheng battle, further enhancing the combat morale, victory confidence, and combat skills of the soldiers. During that battle, when the 2728 unit and the 78 unit had not yet successfully scaled the city walls, some soldiers in the 2829 unit were somewhat affected by the situation. Later, this matter was spontaneously reviewed among some commanders and fighters of the 1st company, raising the question: "Why were six people able to get up?" This sparked a keen interest in learning among everyone. Therefore, the leadership absorbed the opinions brewed by the masses and summarized them into four questions: (1) Why were some of us able to get up there? (2) Why were none of those who got up injured or killed? (3) Why were the enemy throwing bricks? (4) Why were there casualties among those in the rear? After a day of section-by-section review, the commanders and fighters generally arrived at the following answers: (1) The city wall can be climbed, as proven by those who climbed up. (2) The more fierce and rapid the action, the more it can reduce and avoid casualties. (3) The enemy's firepower is not strong; otherwise, why would they be throwing bricks? After understanding these four whys, the soldiers became even more courageous in combat.

Recognizing the significant gains of these methods, the 1014 and 275 units also successively promoted "using new methods to review combat" in their own internal publications. The 275 unit believes that this is consistent with the method used by a certain unit of the New Fourth Army to review combat, "It will enable our soldiers' military learning to gain new methods, increase their interest in learning, and thus greatly improve combat skills."

　　冀鲁豫前线二八二九部队
    用新方法检讨战斗结合实际学习战术
    【本报特讯】冀鲁豫前线二八二九部队用新的方法检讨聊城战斗，更加提高了战士们的战斗情绪、胜利信心和作战技术。该役，二七二八部队和七八部队登城尚未成功时，二八二九部队也有一部分战士情绪受些影响。后来这事在一连部分指战员中自动地检讨起来提出：“为什么能上去六个人？”的疑问，引起了大家热烈的学习兴趣，于是领导上吸收群众酝酿的意见，归纳为四个问题：（一）为什么我们能上去一些人？（二）为什么上去的人都没有伤亡？（三）为什么敌人打砖头？（四）为什么在后面的反有伤亡？经过一天的分班检讨，指战员们普遍地得出下面的答案：（一）城墙可以登上去，爬上去的即是证明。（二）动作愈猛愈快愈可减少与避免伤亡。（三）敌人的火力并不强，不然他为什么打砖头呢？明白了这四个为什么之后，战士们作战时就更加勇敢了。
    认识了这些办法的显著收获，一○一四及二七五部队也先后在本部机关报上广为提倡“用新的方法去检讨战斗”。二七五部队认为这和新四军某部检讨战斗的方法是一致的，“它将使我们战士的军事学习获得新的方法，提高其学习兴趣，并因而大大的提高作战技术。”
