    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline Report, February 15th] After nine battles and nine victories, General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army has recovered vast areas of lost territory and is actively responding to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's New Year's Day call to help the people in the recovered areas carry out land reform. A large number of cadres have been selected from various units to form peasant emancipation work teams. When the team was established, General Liu Bocheng personally gave a speech, earnestly telling everyone: "The peasants are our lifeline. If we don't help the peasants to liberate themselves, then our fighting and bloodshed will be meaningless... " In addition to instructing the Field Political Department to mobilize all commanders and soldiers to actively help the peasants to liberate themselves, General Liu also transferred his guard, Comrade Kang Li, who had been with him for many years, to work in the emancipation team. He also gave detailed work instructions, repeatedly urging him to work hard and serve the people. After a short period of study of land policy, the emancipation team has now been assigned to the newly recovered areas of Juye, Jiaxiang and other seven counties to help local farmers carry out the land-to-the-tiller movement, with a view to completing land reform before the spring plowing, so that the farmers who have suffered under the ravages of Chiang's army can restore their happy lives. When the team arrived in various places, the farmers were all elated and said, "The Eighth Route Army drove away Chiang's army for us, and now they are here to help us completely liberate ourselves!" When the emancipation team was holding a peasant emancipation meeting in a village, a large number of Chiang's army officers who had laid down their weapons happened to pass by. A farmer surnamed Lü sarcastically pointed at the Chiang's army officers and said, "You still dare to come back for revenge?!" The emancipation team assigned to Juye County has, after a week of work, helped the farmers in some villages to recover the land and grain seized by traitors, local bullies, and landlords. The farmers have automatically risen up and sent a large number of traitors and local bullies to the democratic government. At the request of all the farmers, the democratic government has publicly tried and executed Yu Baojiang, a heinous traitor from Xiaoguantun. The commanders and soldiers who have made meritorious contributions on the self-defense battlefield are now launching a campaign to make further contributions to the people in the emancipation movement. The farmers in each village are clamoring for the emancipation team to go to their own villages as soon as possible to help them emancipate themselves.
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Report, February 15th] The Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, responding to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's New Year's Day call, has actively assisted the masses in carrying out land reform, achieving great results, strengthening the relationship between the army and the people, laying a solid foundation for carrying out mass guerrilla warfare, raising class consciousness within the army, and fostering close relations between officers and soldiers. The army has been unprecedentedly consolidated and has been commended by the leaders of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, becoming a model for the army in helping the masses carry out land reform. Its main experiences are: (1) All commanders and soldiers must first recognize ideologically that land reform will solidify and expand the foundation of the people's army, and that only by helping the people to obtain land can we gain the long-term support of the people. (2) The method of ideological mobilization within the army should not be simply lecturing, but should take the form of recounting past grievances, allowing the soldiers to compare their past lives with the present lives of the masses, thereby raising class consciousness. (3) First help the masses with production and labor to get close to the masses, understand the problems of the masses, in order to help the masses carry out land reform.

　　前线部队响应朱总司令元旦号召
    帮助收复地区群众翻身
    巨野嘉祥等地农民倒回被夺土地
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十五日电】刘伯承将军所部人民解放军，继九战九捷收复广大失地之后，积极响应朱总司令元旦号召，帮助收复区人民进行土地改革。特由各部队中抽调大批干部，组成农民翻身大队。当该队成立时，刘伯承将军亲临讲话，他谆谆告诉大家：“农民是我们的命根，如果不帮助农民翻身，那末我们作战流血就毫无意义了。………”刘将军除嘱野战政治部动员全体指战员积极帮助农民翻身外，并将随从自己多年的警卫员康礼同志调到翻身队工作。并给以详细的工作指示，再三叮嘱努力工作，为人民服务。翻身大队在进行短期土地政策学习后，现已分配至巨野、嘉祥等七县新收复区，帮助当地农民进行土地回家运动，以期春耕前完成土地改革，使遭受蒋军蹂躏过的农民恢复幸福生活。该队到达各地后，农民们都欢欣鼓舞地说：“八路军为咱们打走蒋军后，又来帮助咱们彻底翻身了！”当翻身队正在某村开农民翻身大会时，恰有前线大批放下武器的蒋军军官路过。农民吕某讽刺地指着蒋军军官说道：“你们还敢来倒算吗？！”分配到巨野县的翻身队，经一周工作，已帮助部分村庄的农民把被汉奸恶霸地主夺去的土地和粮食倒回。农民已自动起来，将大批汉奸恶霸捆送民主政府。民主政府在全体农民的要求下，已将肖官屯罪大恶极的汉奸俞宝江公审枪决。曾在自卫战场上立过功的指战员们，现正展开在翻身运动中为人民再立功。各村农民都纷纷要求翻身队早日到他们自己村庄中去，帮助他们翻身。
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】冀鲁豫汶上大队二连，响应朱总司令元旦号召，积极帮助群众进行土地改革，获得巨大成绩，密切了军民关系，打下开展群众性游击战争的坚实基础，在部队内部提高了阶级觉悟，亲密了官兵关系，部队得到空前的巩固，荣获冀鲁豫军区首长通令嘉奖，已成为部队帮助群众进行土地改革的旗帜。其主要经验是：（一）全体指战员必须首先在思想上认识土地改革会坚实扩大人民军队的基础，帮助人民获得土地始能得到人民长期支持。（二）在部队内部进行思想动员的方法不是单纯上课讲话，而应采取诉苦方式，让战士们将自己过去的生活和现在群众的生活联系比较，提高阶级觉悟。（三）首先帮助群众生产劳动以接近群众，了解群众中的问题，以便帮助群众进行土地改革。
