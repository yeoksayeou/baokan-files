[This report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 20th] Our democratic government cares about the masses affected by Chiang Kai-shek's disaster, and has specially reduced and exempted the collection of public grain. The ninth district of Juye County was the most severely affected by Chiang Kai-shek's disaster. The government reduced the collection of public grain from 150 Qing of land – equivalent to more than 240,000 Jin of millet. The reduction and exemption particularly took care of active militia members and poor farmers, while no reductions or exemptions were given to landlords who fled or participated in the puppet regime. After the completion of the reduction work, the masses deeply felt the care of the democratic government. An old woman in the West Street of Chengguan originally had a burden of eight mu, but because she was severely affected by the disaster, the government reduced it all. Guo Fuxiang from East Street had a burden of eleven mu, and eight mu of land were reduced. The masses all reflected: "This spring, children and adults will not go hungry."

　　政府关心鄄城受蒋灾群众
    减免公粮征收
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】我民主政府关心受蒋灾群众，特减、免征收公粮。鄄城受蒋灾以九区为最严重，政府减征一百五十顷地的公粮——合小米二十四万余斤。减免中特别照顾了民兵积极分子、贫苦农民，对逃亡地主参加伪政权者一律不减免。减征工作完后，群众深感民主政府的关心。城关西街一个老大娘，原八亩负担，但因受灾严重，政府都减了。东街郭俯祥的十一亩负担，减去了八亩地。群众都反映：“今年春天小孩大人都不致挨饿了”。
