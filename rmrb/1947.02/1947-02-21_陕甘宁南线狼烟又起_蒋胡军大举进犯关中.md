　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: The southern front of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is once again filled with the flames of civil war ignited by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Yesterday, the main force of Hu Zongnan's army, consisting of seven brigades and thirteen regiments, divided into five routes and, with the support of two aircraft, launched a large-scale offensive against our Guanzhong Sub-region. They have already occupied more than ten villages and towns, including Heping Village, Yetaishan (Chishui), and Changshentou (Xinzheng), located thirty to eighty *li* east, west, and south of Malan City, where the Guanzhong Commissioner's Office is located. In recent weeks, Hu's forces have been actively deploying for an attack on the Border Region, having telegraphed various parties to transfer their main forces to the southern front of the Border Region and establish eastern and western front commands. Liao Ang (former commander of the 76th Division), the commander of the eastern front, arrived in Yijun on the 13th to assume his duties, while Zhong Shi (former commander of the 36th Division), the commander of the western front, arrived in Zhitian Town on the 16th. Since the beginning of the month, the 78th Brigade of the 1st Division, the 47th Brigade of the 27th Division, and one regiment of the 13th Brigade of Hu's forces have crossed the western border from Shanxi Province and are stationed in the Yichuan and Luochuan areas. The 144th Brigade and 24th Brigade of the 76th Division, originally stationed near Xi'an, have moved to中部 (this appears to be a place name, likely 中部县 Zhongbu County but cannot be confirmed) and Yijun, while the entire 15th Division (the 315th Brigade and the 64th Brigade) has also been transferred from western Henan and southern Shaanxi to ＠zhou and Xianyang.
