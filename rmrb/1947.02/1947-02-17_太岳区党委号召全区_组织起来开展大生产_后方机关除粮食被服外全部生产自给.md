　　[This newspaper Taiyue 15th dispatch] The Taiyue District Party Committee recently issued instructions on launching a large-scale production campaign this year, calling on farmers throughout the district to widely organize after the land is returned to them, carry out a large-scale production movement, move towards building a prosperous family and getting rich, and strive for cultivating three and saving one.

　　Party, government, and civilian personnel at all levels in the district must devote 90 percent of their energy to leading this huge movement in order to guarantee military and civilian supplies and strive for the complete victory of the patriotic self-defense war. The instructions emphasized that agricultural production should be the main focus, stressing that "organization" should replace machines, three workers saving one worker, especially the widespread organization of full and semi-labor forces, so that production is combined with war, land reform, support, and preferential treatment for soldiers. Attention should be paid to voluntary combinations and exchanges, and the mass line should be implemented. The government should vigorously help the masses solve specific difficulties in production. The difficulties of draught animals should be solved by means of mutual assistance and labor exchange of human and animal power, combining public and private, rewarding the purchase of livestock to other areas, and organizing people to pull plows. Attention should be paid to helping landlords and gentry whose property has been confiscated to live and solve their difficulties in production, and to follow the path of Zhang Yongtai. Secondly, it is pointed out that agriculture must be combined with sideline occupations, so that the whole region can move towards self-sufficiency. The development of sideline occupations should focus on organizing transportation. Village cooperatives should become organizations that lead the masses in agricultural and sideline production, overcoming the tendency of purely making profits. It is also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen handicraft production, mainly textiles, papermaking, oil pressing, and salt making, improve quality, expand the scope of raw materials, improve tools, and eliminate the scissors gap between grain and necessities. In addition, in the large-scale production movement, it is necessary to accurately calculate, save manpower, reorganize services, resolutely implement the service regulations, practice thrift and reorganize finances, change the old burden methods, so as not to overburden the emancipated households and affect production, and implement the policy of rewarding production and labor heroes.

　　Regarding the production in border and guerrilla areas, it must be closely combined with guerrilla warfare and land reform. The first priority is the combination of labor and military, strengthening the unified leadership of the headquarters or the war participation committee, and establishing a joint defense and joint village organization that combines labor and military. Various armed forces in the border areas (including local corps, guerrillas, and armed work teams) must protect the masses in production during spring plowing and other important production seasons. At present, the focus should be on war and land reform. The main preparations before spring plowing are to rectify mutual aid groups, solve various practical difficulties in spring plowing, and dispel the ideological concerns of the masses who dare not move towards getting rich. Every farmer should formulate a plan for settling down or getting rich, and every mutual aid group, mutual aid brigade, and cooperative should also formulate a production plan. Before spring plowing, each village should conduct a democratic assessment of land output as a burden standard. Grasp specific preparations such as accumulating fertilizer, collecting firewood, and transporting coal.

　　The instructions finally called on all rear-area organs to launch a large-scale production self-sufficiency movement this year. All organs in the rear area should participate in production this year and strive to be entirely self-sufficient except for food and clothing. All party, government, and civilian personnel are required to contribute 2,000 yuan, with equal emphasis on agricultural, industrial, and sideline production, and to correct the tendency of purely commercial production. The heads of each organ should personally take action to mobilize the vast number of cadres and masses in the organ to participate in production together and give full play to their skills.
