Wei County Summarizes Model Village Work
    Further Deepens Mass Movement
    [This paper, Wei County, 9th] The work of 49 inspection and rent reduction model villages in ten districts of Wei County has come to an end. In the ten model villages of the first district, more than 30 landlord households were liquidated before the old year, feudal exploitation was completely eliminated, and mass organizations were rectified. After summarizing the work of the model villages, the county party committee emphasized that, in addition to measuring the degree of mass mobilization from the perspective of land and class changes, continued attention should be paid to resolving organizational unity and ideological awareness in order to fully mobilize the masses. It further pointed out that county and district cadres should pay attention to cultivating mass leaders, strengthening their education in serving the masses, and cultivating their democratic style. Finally, it summarized the general steps and experiences of this mass mobilization: The first step is to conduct universal mobilization, clarify the policy of "land to the tiller," express the leadership's attitude, and emphasize that poor and middle peasants are one family. The second step is to conduct a democratic general inspection, resolve internal problems, and elect a turn-over committee, allowing the masses to review the reasons why they did not turn over in the past or did not turn over thoroughly. The third step is to launch a mass-based appeal to bitterness and trace the roots of bitterness, improve class consciousness, and launch struggles. After the struggle comes to an end, hold a thinking meeting to conduct education.

    进一步深入群运
    【本报威县九日电】威县十个区四十九个查减模范村工作告一段落，一区十个示范村，旧年前即清算了三十多户地主，彻底消灭了封建剥削，整顿了群众组织，县委于总结示范村工作后，强调提出，除从土地及阶层变化上衡量群众发动的程度外，还应继续注意解决组织上的团结，思想上的觉悟，以求充分发动群众。继指出县区干部应注意培养群众领袖，加强其为群众服务的教育，培养其民主作风。最后总结出这次发动群众的一般步骤与经验；第一步普遍动员，明确“耕者有其田”方针，表明领导态度，强调贫中农是一家。第二步进行民主大检查，解决内部问题，选举翻身委员会，让群众检讨过去未翻身和翻身不彻底的原因。第三步开展群众性的诉苦追苦根，提高阶级觉悟，开展斗争。斗争告一段落，举行想想会进行教育。
