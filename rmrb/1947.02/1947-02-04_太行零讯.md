It was pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to implement the mass line of combining collection with organizing mass production, and the policy of village funds for production and self-sufficiency. Vigorously develop sideline occupations, especially the textile and transportation industries, to increase income and overcome financial difficulties. When the land investigation movement ends and transitions to large-scale production, a certain amount of time should be spent educating cadres ideologically so that all cadres and the masses understand our resources, strengthen the scientific organization of logistics work, and promote the use of civilian labor. Strictly establish and implement various systems, and transform financial and grain cadres, to ensure the supply for the patriotic self-defense war.
