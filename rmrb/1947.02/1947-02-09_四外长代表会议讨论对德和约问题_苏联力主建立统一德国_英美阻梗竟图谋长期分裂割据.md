Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Reports from various sources: The London Foreign Ministers' Conference, convened for nearly three weeks, has yet to achieve concrete results. At the meeting on the 30th of last month, the Soviet Union's previous procedural plan for the German peace treaty was discussed, sparking heated debate. The Soviet procedural plan was: the four powers prepare a draft peace treaty, and the four foreign ministers simultaneously listen to the opinions of other allied countries. Once the draft peace treaty is ready and Germany has formed a central government with the ability to accept obligations, the four powers will convene a peace conference on Germany with relevant allied countries to discuss the treaty. At that time, the German government will be able to offer its opinions. When the work of the peace conference is completed, the four powers will draft the final peace treaty, which will be signed and ratified by the Allied countries and the German government. The United States and Britain disagreed with the Soviet plan, and this discussion did not yield any results. Since the 28th, representatives of various allied countries have begun to state their opinions on the German peace treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Associated Press dispatch: Moscow Radio has just refuted the British and American proposal to form a federation of small countries in Germany and advocated for a unified Germany.

This Newspaper: TASS London, 30th: It is reported that Polish representative Felburaski made a statement at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on January 27. He elaborated in detail the Polish government's views on the German issue, pointing out that the complete democratization of Germany, complete disarmament, and complete elimination of militarist and fascist remnants, together constitute one of the conditions for the European peace treaty. The Polish representative refuted suggestions to divide Germany and supported the political and economic unification of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Paris dispatch: The French government's memorandum on the German Ruhr issue was delivered to the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to France on the afternoon of the 1st for submission to their respective governments. It is reported that the plan, drafted by French Foreign Minister Bidault, advocates transferring ownership of the Ruhr industry to the United Nations and advocates strictly limiting the level of German heavy industry.
