　　Introduction to Production Methods
    Since the call for "seeking production avenues and saving methods," we have received submissions from readers. Here we publish three of them. These three methods may not be suitable for every organization, especially the latter two, which are combined with business operations. They are only intended as examples for comrades in various organizations to consider during production.
          ——Editor
  Comrade Water-Carrying Editor: Aren't you soliciting personal production methods? Now I'll tell you one, please publish it. In Wu'an, many villages lack water, especially those along the Wu-She highway, because there is so much traffic. For example, Luanshiyan has eighteen shops, each of which needs twenty loads of water every day. The shops alone use three hundred and sixty loads of water every day. This water is obtained by hiring people to carry it at a high price of sixty yuan. For example, Yang Tianxing from our company takes time to carry two loads of water a day and earns two thousand yuan in seventeen days. Comrade Zhao Yuxiu, a health worker living in Ye Tao, also makes a lot of money doing this. As long as we can guarantee to carry one load of water a day, everyone can calculate how much money we can earn in a month. (Xi Ying)
  Charging Batteries
    We are engaged in electrical work, and one of our production tasks is charging batteries. The method is to use a 12V hand-cranked generator (this machine is for searchlights), run two wires from the machine to the storage battery, and then crank the generator by hand. Each time we crank for twelve hours, we can charge three batteries. At first, everyone could only crank for ten minutes before getting tired, but now everyone is trained to be able to crank for an hour at a time. In the past, our six machines needed at least thirty-two dry batteries per month, costing four thousand five hundred yuan per battery, totaling one hundred and forty-four thousand yuan. Now that we charge our own batteries and are completely self-sufficient, we charge fifty batteries per month. Each battery can earn a salary of seven hundred yuan. In addition to earning a salary of thirty-five thousand yuan per month, we can also save one hundred and nineteen thousand yuan in electricity costs per month. (Wen)
  Printing Manuscript Paper
    Printing manuscript paper is one of the production methods of our group (a production group of this newspaper office – Editor). But how to print without a printing press? So we thought of a method: use a cast lead plate (a woodcut plate will also work), place it flat on a wooden board, roll an inked printing roller over the lead plate, then lay a piece of white paper on it, and then cover it with three or four layers of waste newspaper. Then, take another roller without ink and push it over. This is how a sheet of manuscript paper is printed. The white paper must be covered with thick paper to be printed cleanly and without tearing. Nail this thick paper to one side of the wooden board for easy lifting and laying. Three people can print about two hundred sheets per hour. The cost of one sheet of manuscript paper is more than five yuan, and it can be sold for at least six or seven yuan, so you can earn more than two hundred yuan per hour. (Xiu Shi)

### 生产办法介绍

专栏：

　　生产办法介绍
    自“征求生产门路，节约办法”后，已接得读者的来稿，兹择三则发表，这三种办法，不一定每个机关都适合，特别是后两则，是结合业务进行的，只作为各机关同志生产时的一个借镜。
          ——编者
  挑水编辑同志：你们不是征求一些个人生产的门道吗？现在我告诉一个，请发表。在武安讲，有很多村庄都缺水，尤其沿武涉大路的村庄，因来往车马如织，用水更多。像乱石岩有店房十八家，每家每日须水二十余担，全村光店家用水每日即达三百六十担。这些水都是以六十块钱的高价觅人挑来，如我们连队的杨天行，一天抽空挑两担水，十七天即得利二千元，住在冶陶的卫生员赵玉秀同志，也作此项生产挣钱不少。只要我们一天能保证挑一担水，一个月能挣多少钱，大家可以算算了。（曦影）
  充电池
    我们是作电务工作的，在我们的生产中，有一项是充电池。办法是用１２Ｖ的手摇发电机（此机是供探照灯用的），从机上拉两根线接到蓄电瓶上，然后用手去摇发电机，每次摇十二小时，即可充成三块电池。起初每人只能摇十分钟就疲倦了，现在每人锻炼得能一次摇一小时了。从前我们六部机器每月至少需用干电池三十二筒，每筒以四千五百元计，共需十四万四千元，现在自己充电、电池全部自给，每月充五十块，每块可得工资七百元，除每月可挣工资三万五千元外，每月尚可节约电费十一万九千元。（文）
  印稿纸
    印稿纸是我们小组（本报馆的一个生产小组——编者）的一种生产办法。可是没有印刷机如何印呢？于是想了一种方法：用铸好了的一块铅板（木刻板也行）把它平放在一块木板上，拿一个有滚有油墨的油印滚子在铅板上滚过后，铺上一张白纸，再用三四层厚的废报纸盖在上面，然后拿另一个没有油墨的滚子推过去，这样一张稿子就印成了。白纸上盖着厚纸才能印的干净，不会破。把这厚纸钉在木板的一边，揭铺才方便。三个人印，每小时可印二百张左右。一张稿纸的成本需用五元多钱，最低可卖六七元，那么每小时即可赚二百多元了。（秀实）
