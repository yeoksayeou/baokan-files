How to Cure Swine Fever?

    Editor: Recently, swine fever has been very severe in various places. The symptoms are heavy breathing, gasping for air, and while the pigs want to eat, they vomit as soon as the food reaches their mouths, as if there is a problem with their throats. They die after a few days. Please ask a consultant to come up with a solution, and it would be best if it could be published in the newspaper as soon as possible.
    Reader Liu Wei

    The cause of swine fever is a filterable virus that exists in the blood, tissues, secretions, and excretions of infected pigs. Healthy pigs can be infected if they come into contact with these substances from sick pigs, eat leftover feed from sick pigs, or are fed by people who also feed sick pigs. Therefore, in areas where swine fever exists, healthy pigs must be quickly isolated from sick pigs. As for treatment, highly immune swine fever serum should be used for subcutaneous injection, but it is not easy to prepare the serum. Therefore, this column specially asks the animal doctors in the border area to quickly tell us what simple treatment methods are available. If there are effective remedies submitted that prove effective in treatment, this column will offer a small reward.

    怎样治猪瘟？
    编者同志：近来各地猪瘟很厉害，症状是一呼一吸，一口接不住一口地喘气，倒也想吃东西，但一到嘴就吐了，好像喉咙有毛病，几天之后就死了。请你们代找一个顾问给想个办法来，最好能在报上发表，越快越好。
    读者刘伟
    发生猪瘟的原因，是一种滤过性的毒素，存在于病猪血液、组织、分泌物和排泄物中，好猪如和病猪这些东西接触，吃病猪吃剩的饲料，或者喂病猪的人再喂好猪，都可传染。所以有猪瘟的地方，要赶快把好猪和病猪隔离开来。至于治疗法，要用高度免疫猪瘟血清，施行皮下注射，但配装血清很不容易。故本栏特请边区畜医界，快点告诉我们有何简便医疗法，如有以有效良方应征，医治有效者，本栏当致薄酬。
