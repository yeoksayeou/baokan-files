    Reduction of Public Grain, Production and Savings
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th] The Administrative Committee of the Joint Office of the Northeast Liberated Areas held its 15th Standing Committee meeting on the 11th. It was decided that the total amount of public grain for this year would be reduced by 10% compared to last year, and an agricultural hall would be established to lead production organizations. In addition, water conservancy loans of 100 million yuan (15 yuan per legal tender) will be issued to restore old water conservancy construction. At the same time, all agencies are strictly implementing production and savings. The General Political Department of the Democratic Allied Army has abolished small kitchens and changed to medium and large kitchens, and everyone is making shoes themselves. The department's tobacco expenses have been reduced from 120,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per square. The paper loss of the Northeast Daily Printing Plant has been reduced from 5% to 0.4% per day, saving 40,000 yuan per day. The Finance and Economics Department is simplifying administration and reducing living standards, with office expenses reduced by half. After streamlining, the logistics department of the Songjiang Military Region also saved one-third of its expenses. Currently, all units are preparing to raise pigs, raise chickens, open mills, and grow vegetables to strive for self-sufficiency.
