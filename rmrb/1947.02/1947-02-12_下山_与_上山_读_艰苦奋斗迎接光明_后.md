    "Descending the Mountain" and "Ascending the Mountain"
    After Reading "Struggle Hard and Greet the Light"
    Zheng Shidi

    Since this publication solicited articles on thought and obligatory study on the 19th of last month, we have successively received submissions. Apart from the one or two that have been published previously, we now select the following two for publication. We hope that everyone will continue to write more articles in this area as the situation develops and as the work and study of various organizations progresses.

    After carefully reading "Struggle Hard and Greet the Light," I feel that today's struggle is still to strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation and to seek the nation's "great turnaround." The objects of the struggle are the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen, as well as their godfather, the American imperialists. The method of struggle is the military self-defense war in response to Chiang Kai-shek's damned civil war policy. Coordinate with the world-scale anti-American fascist democratic united front. Greet the upcoming new high tide of the democratic movement. Although we still have difficulties, such as some areas inevitably becoming guerrilla zones occupied by the Chiang army, as well as financial and economic difficulties, the period of defeating the dictatorial, civil war-mongering traitor—Chiang Kai-shek—will not be too long, and the bright future of establishing a New Democratic state system is not too far away.

    Looking back, after the Japanese surrender, I had quite harmful peaceful illusions. I believed it when the Chiang government representatives signed the Political Consultative Conference resolution, and when Chiang Kai-shek distributed the personally signed ceasefire order by plane. I unconsciously breathed a sigh of relief! I thought: the life of climbing mountain gullies for the past eight or nine years could be considered over. I descended the mountain and entered Xingtai City. I often ridiculed myself, saying, "The opposition to urban viewpoints has not yet been completely countered, and it's time to oppose rural viewpoints again." What I meant was that after entering the city, engaging in peaceful struggle, using the set of methods from the rural environment would no longer be appropriate. Because of this viewpoint, I started learning to drink alcohol, started sitting on sofas, arranging flower vases, and paying attention to "fashion." We are not people who are content with poverty; naturally, we can use these things in the city, but from then on, I developed a sense of complacency, and further developed the idea of going home for family reunion, relaxing revolutionary work, which was a significant mistake.

    Chiang Kai-shek killed Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu, then convened a one-party-dominated pseudo-National Assembly and attacked the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, among others, called on us to change our way of life, asking us to emphasize discipline and prepare to use our thighs as tables. All of this made me deeply reflect. While Xingtai was preparing for war, I was recuperating from illness and returned to the mountain gully. Peaceful illusions were shattered, followed by impatience, thinking that there would be at least another eight years of anti-American war, and I was really worried about the possibility of a third world war, unconsciously overestimating the role of war instigators, as if Churchill and Vandenberg could still succeed. After reading "Struggle Hard and Greet the Light," and recalling Stalin's remarks, "A Soviet-American war is impossible!" I couldn't help but nod in agreement! Indeed, the new high tide of the democratic movement—the anti-American and anti-Chiang democratic movement—will soon rise, and the patriotic movement of the broad masses of students against the atrocities of the American army is a signal. In order to greet the light, I must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle that I have cultivated in the Taihang Mountains for many years. Once the ideological burden is removed, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.

    “下山”与“上山”
    读“艰苦奋斗迎接光明”后
    正士弟
    自上月十九日本刊征求思想和义务学习的文稿以来，已陆续收到应征稿件，除过去已发表的一两篇外，现择下列两篇发表。我们希望大家随着时局的发展，各机关工作学习的进程，继续多写这方面的稿件来。
              ——编者          
    细心的读了“艰苦奋斗、迎接光明”，我觉得今天的奋斗仍是为了争取中华民族的解放，求得民族的“大翻身”。斗争对象是蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族，以及他们的干爹美帝国主义者。斗争方法便是回答蒋该死内战政策的军事自卫战争。配合世界规模的反美法西斯的民主统一战线。迎接快要到来的新的民主运动高潮。我们虽然还有困难，如某些地区难免沦为蒋军占领的游击区，以及财政经济上的困难。战胜独裁内战的卖国贼——蒋该死的时期不会太长，建立起新民主主义国家制度的光明前途不会太远。
    回想自日本投降以后，我产生过颇有害的和平幻想。蒋政府代表在政协决议上签了字，蒋介石用飞机散发亲自署名的停战令，我都信以为真。不自觉的松了一口气！心想：八九年来爬山沟的生活可算结束了。我下了山，进了邢台市，我常自嘲说：“反对城市观点还没有反完，又该反对农村观点了”。意思是说：走进城市后，进行和平斗争，再用农村环境那一套，便不合适了。由于这一观点，我开始学喝酒了，开始坐沙发，摆花瓶，讲究“时髦”了。我们并非是安于贫困的人，城市里有这些东西，自然可以用，但我从此产生了太平观念，进一步产生了回家团圆的思想，放松了革命工作，却是遗误不小。
    蒋介石杀害了闻一多、李公朴，又召开一党包办的伪国大，进攻陕甘宁边区，朱总司令、刘少奇同志等，号召我们改变生活方式，叫我们强调纪律性、准备用大腿当桌子，都使我深自反省。而邢台备战时我正在养病中，又回到山沟里来了。和平幻想打碎了，接着来的便是急燥情绪，以为至少又得八年抗美战争，真的担心有第三次世界大战的可能性，不自觉的过高估计战争挑拨者的作用，好像邱吉尔、范登堡之流还会成事似的。读了“艰苦奋斗迎接光明”，再想起斯大林的谈话：“苏美战争不可能！”我不禁暗自点头称是！真的，新的民主运动高潮——反美蒋的民主运动巨浪，不久便会起来，广大的学生反对美军暴行的爱国运动便是个信号。为了迎接光明，我一定要把多年来在太行山中锻炼出来的艰苦精神发扬起来，思想上去了包袱，就没有什么困难不能克服，也没有什么事情不能干成功了。
