　　The Life of Farmers in "Tianfu"
    Sichuan Rural Communication
    Sichuan countryside, once known as "Tianfu" (Land of Abundance), has become hell today.

    Last year, just a few days after the harvest, many farmers in Liangshan, Shi＠ and other counties in eastern Sichuan could only eat one meal of corn porridge a day; even farmers in the relatively affluent Longchang, Fushun and other counties in southern Sichuan were mainly eating sweet potatoes. Even worse, Sichuan produces salt, but farmers in Liangshan, Shi＠ and other counties had no salt to eat, and many farmers could not afford clothes. In Tongjiang and Nanchong in northern Sichuan, Pengshui and Qianjiang in eastern Sichuan, and Gulin and GuSong in southwestern Sichuan, naked farmers, wearing only a piece of ragged cloth around their waists to cover their shame, could be seen everywhere. Those slightly better off wore a net-like patchwork of rags. In the piercing cold wind, they could only huddle in dirty huts, tending the firewood, waiting for spring to arrive. Bedding was out of the question. A pile of corn leaves or a "rice seedling felt" woven from straw was their treasure for resisting the cold nights. There is a popular folk song in Sichuan now that says: "When you go out, take the door with you, lest the ox eat the bedding." This is in stark contrast to the fine clothes and delicacies of the gentlemen. The lives of primary school teachers in rural areas are also unbearably hard. In a primary school in Xianfeng Township, Xingwen County, southern Sichuan, the teachers sleep on straw and eat corn. No one has shoes to wear, and all forty or fifty students in the school have no pants to wear. This situation is all too common in rural Sichuan.

    Where does such a tragic life come from? In just one year last year, the Chiang government ordered the collection of nine million piculs of land tax in Sichuan, with as many as 240 kinds of miscellaneous levies. Taking the land tax as an example, even a small landlord cannot afford it. Zhang Zhiqing, a landlord in Ba County, was forced to pay land tax that accounted for 60 to 70 percent of his total rent last year. Last year, 80% of his land yielded a harvest of eighty piculs of rice. The tenants received twelve piculs, Zhang received sixty-eight piculs, but he had to pay more than forty piculs in tax. As for the farmers, it was even more miserable. Self-cultivating farmers with a little land were naturally driven to the brink of death, and landless tenant farmers were not spared either, because landlords always shifted the land tax onto the tenant farmers. For example, a tenant farmer named Li near Chengdu, due to owing land rent, had to pay land tax on behalf of the landlord. As a result, he was forced to buy a few pounds of pork and secretly put poison in it, poisoning his entire family to death. After Song Ziwen strictly ordered all provinces to complete the payment by the end of December last year, the Sichuan-Kang Supervisory Envoy, the provincial government, and personnel from the Ministry of Food jointly formed a "Tax督征团Supervisory Group," which set out in six routes to supervise the collection of taxes. County-level agencies also desperately squeezed the people. In counties such as Luojiang, officials and runners were not enough, so they also hired a large number of gangsters to "assist in the collection," sending one or two to each farmer who owed taxes, requiring them to provide cigarettes, alcohol, tea, and food every day, "beating, scolding, and demanding money." Under such coercion, how could the farmers not be ruined?

    In the Chengdu Plain and various counties in southern Sichuan, the land rent is mostly seven parts for the landlord and three parts for the tenant, or even the tenant only gets 15 or 20 percent. For example, a tenant farmer in Xinglong Township, Ba County, told a reporter from the National Gazette: "He harvested twenty-one piculs of grain last year, and sixteen piculs went to pay the landlord's rent." A major reason for the high land rent is the heavy taxes. Zhang Zhiqing, a landlord in Ba County, said: "With taxes and the low price of grain, how can we not increase the rent?"

    The threat of exorbitant taxes and levies is even greater for tenant farmers. In Ba County, tenant farmers who cultivate twenty to thirty piculs of grain land have to pay at least about 10,000 yuan per month for winter defense fees, village chief office expenses, local soldier fees, and other taxes, which is equivalent to one picul of grain. In addition to paying land rent, the farmers cannot even afford the taxes with their by-products. They have no choice but to borrow money to pay taxes. The general rural interest rate is two-thirds, with a four-month term. For example, if you borrow 10,000 yuan, you have to add 3,200 yuan for one term, and many creditors have to deduct the interest first when borrowing money, that is, borrowing 10,000 yuan actually only gets 6,800 yuan, and the higher interest rate is far beyond this. Therefore, the land or the deposit for rented land of the borrowing farmers disappears in the blink of an eye, and they are forced to leave the land with tears and wander to the city or run to Liangshan.

　　“天府”农民的生活
    四川农村通讯
    向称“天府”的四川农村，今天变成地狱。
    去年在刚收获后不久的几天，川东梁山、石＠等县许多农民，每天只能吃到一顿包谷稀粥；连富庶的川南隆昌、富顺等县的农民，亦以番薯作主要食粮。更惨的是四川的产食盐，而梁山、石＠等县农民都没有盐吃，大量农民穿不上衣服。川北的通江、南充，川东的彭水、黔江，川西南的古蔺、古宋等地，随处见到是赤身露体，只在腰间围着一块遮羞的破布的农民，稍好一些的披着一袭网状的百结鹑衣，在刺骨寒风里，他们只能缩在肮脏的小屋中爬着柴火等待春天降临。被子更谈不到了，床上的一堆包谷叶或一条用稻草编成的“秧毡”，就是他们抵御夜寒的宝贝。四川现在流行着一句民谣说：“一出门来把门带，只怕牛儿吃铺盖”。这和当老爷们的锦衣玉食正成一对比。农村里小学教师们的生活，也苦得不可言状。川南兴文县仙峰乡的一所小学，教师们都是睡稻草吃包谷，没有一个人有鞋穿的，全校四五十个学生，全体都没有裤子穿，这种情形在四川农村里是太平常了。
    这样的悲惨生活从何而来？仅去年一年，蒋政府即下令在四川征收田赋九百万石，而各种苛杂名目达二百四十种之多。以田赋说，连个小地主也吃不消。巴县的一个地主张志清，去年被勒缴的田赋占他全部地租的百分之六七十，去年他的田里八成收，产稻谷八十石，佃户分得十二石，张分得六十八石，缴出赋却去了四十多石。至于农民们那就更惨，多少有一点地的自佃农，自然被逼得死去活来，无地的佃农也不能幸免，因为地主总是转嫁田赋于佃农。如成都附近佃农李某，因欠地租，只得代地主缴田赋，结果被逼得买了几斤猪肉暗放毒药，将满门毒死。去年宋子文严令各省限十二月底缴完后，川康监察使者、省府和粮食部人员合组“督征团”，分六路出发督征，县级机关也就拼命向人民压榨。如罗江等县，官吏差役不够用，还雇用大批流氓“助征”，给欠赋农民每家派去一两个，每天要供给烟酒茶饭，“一打二骂三要钱”，这样威逼下，农民怎不倾家荡产？
    四川的地租，在成都平原及川南各县，大多是主七佃三，甚至佃户只得百分之十五或二十，如巴县兴隆乡某佃农告国民公报记者说：“他去年收谷二十一石，缴地主租就去十六石。”地租高的一个重要原因是捐税重。巴县地主张志清说：“又有捐税，谷价又相因（便宜之意），我们不加租唧格得了”。
    苛捐杂税对佃农的威胁更大，在巴县种二三十石谷子田地的佃农，每月负冬防费、保长办公费、乡丁费等捐税最少在万元左右，即相当一石谷子，农民除交地租外，连同副产物也不够应付捐税，迫不得已只有借债缴税。而一般农村利率为三分二，以四个月为一期，如借一万元，一期须加出三千二百元，且很多债权人在借钱时须先扣除利息，即借一万元只实得六千八百元，高的利率更远超于此，所以借债的农民，他的土地或租地的押金转眼不见，便只有被迫着吞着泪离开土地，流落城市或奔上梁山了。
