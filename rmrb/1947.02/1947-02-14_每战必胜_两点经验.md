    Every Battle is Won
    Two Points of Experience
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 11th dispatch] After the heroic sacrifice of Gao Huida, a hero of the Hongzhao defense of the homeland, the militiamen of the Hongzhao Third District, in order to further develop the defense of the homeland movement, summarized the two main experiences of Gao Huida's ever-victorious combat team: First, Gao Huida led the combat militia in close combination with the mass struggle. Before each struggle, he carefully considered the relationship between combat and the interests of the masses, and how to fight well. Therefore, each time he protected the interests of the masses and received enthusiastic support from the masses. He usually paid special attention to the relationship with the masses, patiently persuading and waiting for the backward masses. When the Chiang army initially invaded, some people in the village were quite frightened and asked him to leave the village. He did not blame the masses for being backward. He temporarily moved to the field to arrange combat. When the Chiang army was driven away and his hometown was protected, he immediately used examples to raise the awareness of the masses, guiding them to automatically rise up to fight, unite around the militia, and become the ears, eyes, hands, and feet of the militia. Second, Gao Huida was good at creating various tactics, mastering the principle of fighting when advantageous and not fighting when disadvantageous. When advantageous, he considered how to fight to be more advantageous; when disadvantageous, he considered how to deal with the enemy and avoid losses to the masses. Therefore, Gao Huida's combat methods each time were sometimes ambushes, sometimes provoking two groups of enemies to fight each other, sometimes disguising himself as the enemy in plain clothes to capture the enemy alive, and sometimes using landmine explosions, instead of fighting blindly, hard, or chaotically.

    每战必胜
    两点经验
    【本报太岳十一日电】洪赵保乡英雄高辉达光荣牺牲后，洪赵三区民兵为进一步开展保乡运动，总结出高辉达战斗队常胜的两点主要经验：第一、高辉达领导战斗民兵是与群众斗争密切结合的。他每次斗争前，都仔细考虑战斗与群众利益的关系，及如何打才好等问题。因此，每次都保卫了群众利益，得到群众热烈拥护。他平时特别注意与群众的关系，对落后群众耐心说服等待。蒋军最初进犯时，村里有些人相当恐惧，要他离开村子，他并不怪群众落后，自己暂时转移到野外布置战斗，到打走蒋军，保住家乡时，他即用实例提高群众觉悟，引导群众自动起来战斗，团结在民兵周围，成为民兵的耳、目、手、足。第二、高辉达善于创造各种战术，掌握有利就打，无利不打的原则。有利时，考虑怎么打才更有利，不利时，考虑如何对付敌人，使群众避免损失。因此，高辉达的战斗每次的打法忽而伏击，忽而挑拨两股敌人对打，忽而化装敌人便衣，活捉敌人，忽而用地雷爆炸，而不是蛮打硬打乱打。
