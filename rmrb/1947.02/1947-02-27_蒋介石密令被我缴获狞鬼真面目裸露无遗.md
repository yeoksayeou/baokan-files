Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: The People's Liberation Army seized a crucial secret order from Chiang Kai-shek when it recovered Bo County on February 2nd. The full text of Chiang Kai-shek's secret order is published below, along with an editorial note from our agency. The original text is as follows:

Confidential Order Shi Tian No. 70 (December 30th, Republic of China Year 35)

The bandit suppression military operations of this year (Note: since January of the 35th year of the Republic of China; the armistice agreement was signed on January 10th, and the Political Consultative Conference opened) have been effectively directed by our commanders at all levels (Note: the commanders at all levels are directed by Chiang Kai-shek through "bandit suppression" secret orders; publicly claiming "peace" while secretly ordering "suppression"; publicly advocating a "political solution" while secretly pursuing a military solution; the reactionary chieftain Chiang Kai-shek is consistently like this). Officers and soldiers have been loyal and brave, striving for the cause (Note: Fascism, betrayal of the country), sacrificing for the revolution (Note: utter counter-revolution), and have largely accomplished arduous tasks (Note: losing 44 brigades from July to the end of the year), laying the foundation for unification (Note: military "unification"). This is sufficient to comfort the nation (Note: the Chiang family) and the spirits of the fallen soldiers (Note: the spirits of fallen Japanese invaders and Wang's puppet regime soldiers who fought against the Communists, certainly not the spirits of those who died fighting the Japanese), and also sufficient to wash away the endless shame of our party (Note: the Wang party, the Chiang party), and the nation (Note: the nation of the four major families). But the thought of the soldiers' tragic deaths and injuries (Note: Chiang Kai-shek forced them to be cannon fodder in the civil war), and the suffering in the frozen land (Note: also a gift from Chiang Kai-shek's civil war), makes me restless in my dreams (Note: crocodile tears). Now, I will briefly describe to my officers and soldiers the relationship of important battles this year and the gains and losses in various regions:

The Battle of Siping Street laid the foundation for the recovery of the Northeast (Note: the Northeast had already been recovered by the people; Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Siping Street was merely a "bandit suppression military operation"); the bloody battle of Jining initiated the victory of the overall situation in Chahar; the recovery of Anji, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou re-established the rhetoric of national defense (Note: Chiang Kai-shek is bluffing, vainly trying to pose as an anti-Soviet vanguard, truly a paper tiger easily exposed). The annihilation of Li's bandits in northern Hubei (Note: referring to the Central Plains Military Region of the People's Liberation Army under the command of General Li Xiannian), the bloody battle of Hua-Pu in northern Henan, the crushing defeat of the treacherous bandits in northern Jiangsu, northern Shandong, northern Henan, southern Shanxi, and eastern Hebei, and the opening of the Ping-Gu, Ping-Sui, Fu-Ji, Lin-Yi, and southern Tongpu lines, gradually stabilized the turbulent situation in North China (Note: it is clear that all of these were planned and step-by-step offensives). All of this is sufficient to coordinate with the strategic policy (Note: it is clear that all political maneuvers, such as the Four Pledges, the truce order, the Political Consultative Conference, and even the bogus National Assembly and bogus constitution, are merely deceptive means for Chiang Kai-shek), to achieve most of our national defense objectives (Note: Trampling the Chinese people underfoot is Chiang Kai-shek's "national defense objective"; his so-called "national defense" is the defense of the four major families). Repeatedly hearing news of victories fills my heart with joy (Note: look how much Chiang Kai-shek loves "peace"! Especially the Provisional 38th Division's defense of the people, fighting bitterly on one side; the 9,000-plus men (formed by local troops, now the reorganized 52nd Division, transferred to Hunan for rest and reorganization) holding Lincheng firmly for ten days; and the Hebei Provincial Security Column's brave and resolute defense of Baoding (Note: repeating a few miscellaneous brands with a few words is also crocodile tears; in reality, sacrificing miscellaneous brands) ensuring key towns, causing the enemy bandits to lose heart, turning the situation from danger to safety, and reversing military defeats into victories, is even more commendable (Note: the conspiracy is cruel, the ferocious face is fully exposed; those who still have illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talks" should wake up!). However, after studying the past major and minor battles and reviewing the gains and losses, there are still the following shortcomings in offensive and defensive tactics that urgently need attention and correction. I hereby instruct the commanders as follows:

(1) Cooperation between units is not close enough. In the future, special attention should be paid to liaison and coordinated action. You must know that this bandit suppression and pacification of rebellion (Note: should be read as initiating a civil war) is the final result of our revolutionary (Note: should be read as Chiang Kai-shek's fascist counter-revolution) defeat (Note: How sad he sounds!). Whether in career, history or life, the KMT army (Note: referring to the Chiang army) up and down are a whole (Note: What share do the ordinary soldiers and junior officers have in the property of the four families of Chiang, Kong, Soong and Chen?!), that is, if they prosper, they prosper together; if they are humiliated, they are humiliated together; if they live, they live together; if they die, they die together (Note: Hitler's old trick). If the revolution (Note: Fascist counter-revolution) fails and the communist bandits become rampant (Note: the people gain power), then what face will all our officers and soldiers have to stand between heaven and earth (Note: at that time, there will be no more conscription and grain requisition, and no more bureaucratic capital of selling out the country and dictatorship)? And how can we comfort the spirits of our fallen officers and soldiers (Note: victims of the anti-communist civil war) in heaven (Note: wronged souls)? Therefore, the entire army must be of one mind and share the same hatred for the enemy (Note: be Chiang Kai-shek's cannon fodder, oppose the people). In the face of the danger of friendly forces, we must give full assistance. We must never stand by and do nothing, delaying the military opportunity (Note: battlefield experience proves that Chiang's army does not help each other if they are 30 miles apart; Chiang's direct line of troops never rescue the miscellaneous troops) causing the communist bandits (Note: referring to the People's Liberation Army) to defeat them one by one and perish together (Note: Chiang Kai-shek is heartbroken at the annihilation of the direct line of troops, but not for the miscellaneous troops). For example, the defeat of the 43rd Division of Lu (Note: direct line) and the capture of Division Commander Zhao (Note: Zhao Xitian) (Note: the Central News Agency once said "this is not true") are the shame of our KMT army.

(2) Explicit instructions have been given repeatedly regarding preventing the bandit side from specializing in attacking command headquarters at all levels and specifically shooting at our commanders at all levels, and regulations have been issued on how division and brigade commanders should position themselves, how command headquarters at all levels should maintain confidentiality and mobility (Note: the word "mobility" is wonderful, referring to easy escape), which have been distributed on file with detailed warnings, more than twice. However, the commanders still failed to implement them effectively (Note: they can't even escape as well as Chiang Kai-shek). The capture of Brigade Commander Huang of the First Brigade in southern Shanxi in September (Note: Huang Zhengcheng, direct line, heartbroken!), the defeat of the 25th Division in the Northeast (Note: direct line) and the capture of Division Commander Li (Note: Li Zhengyi), and the recent defeat of the Reorganized 69th Division in northern Jiangsu (Note: the division headquarters and all three brigades were completely wiped out), Division Commander Dai's (Note: Dai Zhiqi, a confidant of Chen Cheng) suicide and martyrdom (Note: a total of 99 Chiang army generals were killed or captured, but only one committed suicide, accounting for one out of 99). This is solid expression of revolutionary spirit (Note: Fascist foreign slave spirit) and integrity (Note: the "integrity" of Chiang family's lackeys). It is right and proper to not be spineless in the face of disaster and to die in the right place (Note: heartbroken that a loyal lackey died!). However, the entire battle situation was greatly affected by one person's momentary oversight (because they didn't escape, should die! should die!). Thinking of this, I am not only filled with unforgettable grief, but also with irredeemable regret. How can we not be deeply vigilant!? (Note: long live escaping generals!)

(3) All units should regard the six basic tactics in the Lushan bandit suppression training (Note: established in 1933 after the "Fourth Encirclement Campaign"), namely: 1. Searching, 2. Liaison, 3. Reconnaissance, 4. Guarding, 5. Covering, 6. Shooting, as the basic subjects of bandit suppression tactics. In particular, lower-level cadres such as company, platoon, and squad leaders must have a deep understanding of this, pay attention to flexible application, to prevent unexpected attacks by treacherous bandits and avoid unnecessary losses. For example, the annihilation of the 99th Brigade Commander Zhu Zhixi (Note: direct line) in Huangqiao, northern Jiangsu, was caused by neglecting the above principles. In the future, if there is an opportunity for short-term training in each unit, they should use the regiment as a unit, convene lower-level cadres, and train and practice these six specialized skills in a pragmatic way to become proficient, so as not to repeat the previous mistakes (Note: Chiang Kai-shek does not blame himself for the lack of military strength, the army's war-weariness in the military, the treacherous dictatorship in politics, and the people's livelihood in the economy. He only blames his subordinates for not having good tactics, and he will inevitably repeat the past mistakes).

(4) For every stronghold that our army recovers, I have stipulated (Note: pay attention to the words "I have") that defensive works be constructed within three hours of occupation, so that the enemy bandits will no longer be able to counterattack and capture it. But the troops still failed to implement this regulation. In the western Shandong campaign, many strongholds occupied by our army were lost due to enemy counterattacks (Note: because Chiang Kai-shek gave the People's Liberation Army many American cannons), and even brigade and regimental commanders were killed as a result. For example, Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division was captured in western Shandong because of this. From now on, commanders at all levels must constantly check, earnestly study, and handle the time, method, technology, and equipment for constructing fortifications, and strictly follow the regulations to prevent the enemy bandits' habitual tricks, so that they can no longer succeed.

(5) The units failed to properly safeguard and maintain important tools such as communications, transportation, vehicles, especially joint operations agencies and their troops (Note: the transportation lines are so long, how can they be protected?), causing the army's actions to be slow and delaying the opportunity, which is too much (Note: Having to march, fight, build fortifications, and maintain transportation, and still get scolded, how can actions not be slow?). From now on, senior commanders should personally supervise, regularly check, to avoid corruption and unnecessary damage (Note: Chiang's direct troops are all engaged in speculation and smuggling, eating empty salaries, and selling military supplies, how can they not be corrupt and damaged?).

The above are all important lessons learned from the past year's battles (Note: the important lessons are treacherous diplomacy, political reaction, economic collapse, lack of military strength, and the army's war-weariness, but Chiang Kai-shek did not review any of them). The commanders must earnestly reflect (Note: Chiang Kai-shek should reflect first), follow the improvement, and do not repeat the mistakes (Note: if you follow Chiang Kai-shek's secret order, you will definitely fail!). In the first half of next year (the 36th year), the combat objectives of each unit should be to open up the Longhai, Jinpu, Tongpu, Pinghan, and Chinese Eastern Railway lines, and eliminate the bandits (Note: referring to the People's Liberation Army) in the territory of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi (Note: including Yan'an), to restore national traffic and ensure security. (Note: This is Chiang Kai-shek's half-year combat objective, determined on December 30th of last year, which is enough to prove that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "peace talks" proposed in January this year were completely insincere. However, Chiang Kai-shek's combat objectives, not to mention not being achieved in half a year, will not be achieved in half a century. The People's Liberation Army will definitely be able to crush the Chiang army's offensive!) The chief officers of each war zone and pacification zone should actively prepare and complete their respective tasks in their respective jurisdictions; in particular, they should prepare for mountain warfare and mobile warfare to deal with the guerrillas of the treacherous bandits. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to the political training of the treacherous bandits and the work of intelligence and propaganda should be actively enhanced to accelerate the effectiveness of military operations. However, bandit suppression and pacification of rebellion must be coordinated militarily and politically (Note: so we must pass the pseudo-constitution, "reorganize the government," and strengthen the secret services to fabricate rumors, etc.). The local administrative work in the recovered areas is particularly important (Note: the method is to invite the traitors back to give them official titles and promote them, organize secret service bully returning home teams, confiscate farmers' land, and slaughter patriotic people); after our army enters each bandit area, we must guide our officers and soldiers at all levels to assist local governments at all levels, pay attention to the organization and training of the masses, reorganize armor, and strengthen the people's self-defense forces (Note: the armed forces of bullies, traitors, and secret agents) to stabilize local order and restore various productions (Note: that is, to loot and take over). In handling land disputes, we should pay particular attention to the implementation of the pacification zone's rent reduction regulations (Note: Chiang Kai-shek is most afraid of the land reform in the liberated areas), and ensure that those who return have their land (Note: bullies, traitors, secret agents, and officers have their land). This is the basic issue of the political struggle between our army and the communist bandits (Note: Listen to the "democrats" who oppose land reform in the liberated areas!). I hope our generals will conscientiously implement it and not neglect the ancient saying "Those who travel a hundred miles are only halfway after ninety". At this time when the National Congress (Note: Chiang's pseudo-National Congress) has been successfully completed and the Constitution (Note: Chiang's fascist pseudo-constitution) has been formulated, the domestic and foreign views of our national government and the KMT army have changed (Note: Chiang Kai-shek wanted to use the pseudo-National Congress and the pseudo-Constitution to isolate the democratic forces, but as a result, he isolated himself), and the bandit army has suffered the greatest fatal blow in terms of both military and political aspects (Note: not long after this secret order was issued, our People's Liberation Army annihilated the Chiang army's 26th Division, 57th Division, First Rapid Column, and many other Chiang puppet troops). Our KMT army's bandit suppression work has reached a time of nine deaths and one life (Note: it has reached the time of going downhill). As long as our generals are sincere and work hard in the coming year (Note: previously said five months), we can completely eliminate (Note: this is called "political solution") the wicked and treacherous bandits (Note: Those who advocate national independence, peace, and democracy are called "wicked and treacherous bandits". What is the difference between Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei?), and sweep away the last obstacle to the revolution (Note: Fascist counter-revolution) (Note: Chiang Kai-shek is the last traitor and dictator in our country), then the great disaster can be resolved in one day, and the Three Principles of the People (Note: should be read as Fascism) can be realized throughout the country. I can tell my Prime Minister (Note: Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Kuomintang have long been usurped by Chiang Kai-shek) and the heroic martyrs (Note: Hitler and Wang Jingwei) who died in the revolutionary (Note: taking the lives of the people) battles in heaven. The magnificent achievements of our officers and soldiers (Note: the magnificent achievements of selling out the country and dictating) will be forever recorded in the glorious and splendid history of the National Revolution. (Note: infamous for ten thousand years!) I hope you all will work hard.

　　蒋介石密令被我缴获狞鬼真面目裸露无遗
    【新华社延安廿四日电】人民解放军于二月二日收复亳县时曾缴获蒋介石极重要的密令，兹将蒋介石密令全文公布如下，并由本社编辑部加按语。原文如下：
    侍天字第七十号密令（民国三十五年十二月三十日）
    本年一年（按：自民国卅五年一月以来，是年一月十日停战协定签字，政治协商会议开幕）之剿匪军事（按：公开称中共，密令称“匪”；公开说要“和”秘令说要“剿”；公开说“政治解决”密令说军事解决；反动派头子蒋介石一贯如此），全由我各级将领指挥（按：各级将领又由蒋介石以“剿共”密令指挥）有方，官兵忠勇奋发（按：内战内行，外战外行），为主义（按：法西斯主义，卖国主义）牺牲，为革命（按：十足的反革命）奋斗大多能达成艰巨任务（按：七月到年底送掉四十四个旅）为奠定统一（按：武力“统一”）基础，既足以安慰国家（按：蒋家）及阵亡将士（按：日寇及汪逆的反共阵亡将士，决非抗战阵亡将士）之灵，亦足以湔雪我党（按：汪党、蒋党）国（按：四大家族之国）无穷之耻。惟念将士死伤之惨（按：蒋介石逼他们当内战炮灰），以及冰天雪地之苦（按：也是蒋介石的内战之赐），不禁为之梦魂不安（按：猫哭老鼠）。兹对本年重要战役之关系与各地区经过之得失为我将士略述之：
    自四平街一役，奠定收复东北之基础（按：东北早已由人民收复，蒋介石进攻四平街只是“剿共军事”而已）；集宁血战，启导察视全局之胜利；安集、承德与张垣之收复，重奠国防之言论（按：蒋介石打肿脸充胖子，妄想冒充反苏先锋，确实是一戳即穿的王鸡瓦犬）。鄂北李匪（按：指李先念将军所部之中原区人民解放军）之溃灭，豫北滑濮之血战，苏北、鲁北、豫北、晋南及冀东各地奸匪之蹙败，以及平古、平绥、腹济、临沂与同蒲南段诸线之打通，使华北动荡不安之局势渐告安定（按：可见这些一切都是有计划有步骤的进攻），此均足以配合政略之方针（按：可见政治上的一切如四项诺言、停战令，政治协商以至伪国大、伪宪法等等，蒋介石仅作为欺骗手段），达我国防大部之目的（按：把中国人民踏在地下，就是蒋介石的“国防目的”，其所谓“国防”就是四大家族的家防）。迭闻战讯，衷心快慰（按：看蒋介石何等爱“和平”！）尤以暂编第三八师之保卫人民，苦战一方；第九千多人（系地方部队编成，现为整编五十二师，调湖南休整）之固守临城，为时十万；与冀省保安纵队保守保定，勇毅坚定（按：把几枝杂牌重复上几句，亦是猫哭老鼠，实际上牺牲杂牌），确保重镇，使敌匪为之丧胆，大局转危为安，军事反败为胜，更堪时尚（按：阴谋残忍，凶相毕露；对蒋介石的“和谈”还有幻想的人们应该清醒！）。惟研究历次大小战役，检讨得失，对于攻守战术尚有下列缺点，亟需注意改正，特向各将领指示如下：
    （１）各部队与部队间，合作亦未密切。今后对于联络与协同动作，更应特别注意。须知此次剿匪平乱（按：应读发动内战），我国革命（按：应读为蒋介石的法西斯反革命）战败最后之结果（按：其鸣也哀！）。国军（按：指蒋军）上下，无论事业历史与生命皆是整个的（按：蒋孔宋陈四大家族的财产，小兵外官有什么份？！），就是荣则同荣，辱则同辱，生则同生，死则同死（按：希特勒的老一套）。如果革命（按：法西斯反革命）失败，共匪猖獗（按：人民得势），则我全部官兵复有何颜立于天地之间（按：那时就没有抓兵征粮，也没有卖国独裁的官僚资本了）？且将何以慰我阵亡官兵（按：反共内战的牺牲品）在天之灵（按：冤魂）？故必须全军一心，同仇敌忾（按：替蒋介石当炮灰，反对人民），对于友军之危急，应全力救援，切不可观望不前，贻误戎机（按：战场经验证明，蒋军相隔三十里即不互相救援，蒋军嫡系对杂牌军从来不救援），致共匪（按：指人民解放军），各个击破，同归于尽（按：蒋介石痛心的是嫡系的消灭，对杂牌则不然）。如鲁四第三师（按：嫡系）之覆败，赵师长（按：赵锡田）之被俘（按：中央社曾说“并无其事”），皆为我国军莫人之耻辱（按：嫡系被歼，伤心落泪）。（⑴⑵）
    （２）对于防止匪方专以袭击各级司令部及其专射我各级指挥官之战术，迭经予以明确指示，并规定各师旅长之指挥位置与各级指挥部所在地如何保守机密与机动（按：“机动”二字妙，指易于逃走而言），皆已分行在案，详切申诫，何止再三？然各将领仍未能确实奉行（按：连逃也不如蒋介石会逃）。九月晋南第一旅黄旅长（按：黄正成，嫡系，伤心！）之被俘，东北第二十五师（按：嫡系）之失败及李师长（按：李正谊）之被俘，与此次整编六十九师（按：嫡系）在苏北之失败（按：师部及三个旅全军覆灭）、戴师长（按：戴之奇，陈诚心腹）之自杀殉节（按：蒋军将级军官被毙俘者共九十九个）自杀的只此一个，占九十九分之一），此固为我革命精神（按：法西斯洋奴精神）与气节（按：蒋家走狗的“气节”）之发扬，临难不荀，死得其所，理所当然（按：忠实走狗死了一条，伤心哉！伤心哉！）而以一人一时之疏失（不会逃走，该死！该死！），以致整个战局竟受莫大之影响；言念及此，不仅悲痛难忘，而且后悔无及，能不为之深切警惕耶！？（按：逃将军万岁！）
    （３）各部队应对庐山剿匪训练（按：创办于一九三三年“第四次围剿”后）中之六项基本战术，即：一、搜索，二、联络，三、侦探，四、警戒，五、掩护，六、射击、作为剿匪战术之基本课目，尤须各连排与班长等下级干部人员对此均有深切之认识，注意灵活之运用，以防奸匪不意之袭击，而免受无谓损失。即如第九九旅长朱志席（按：嫡系）在苏北黄桥之覆灭，乃因忽视上述原则所致。今后各部队如有短期训练之机会，即应以团为单位，召集下级干部，对此六种专技应实事求是，训练演习，以资熟练，勿再蹈以往覆辙（按：蒋介石军事上兵力不足，兵心厌战，政治上卖国独裁，经济上民不聊生，却不怪自己，只怪下属战术不好，必然再蹈以往之覆辙）。
    （４）凡我军收复之据点，余曾规定（按：注意“余曾”二字）于占领后三小时内构成防守工事，不再让敌匪反击所攻陷；无奈我各部队仍未能照此规定实施。在鲁西战役中，我军已占领之据点，有遭敌人之反击许多失陷者（按：因为蒋介石送给了人民解放军许多美国炮），甚至旅长团长因之阵亡，如第六八师一一九旅刘旅长广信在鲁西之被俘，即由此失。嗣后各级指挥官对于构筑工事之时间、方式、技术与器材等，均须不断检点，切实研究，并按照规定办理，严防敌匪之惯技，使之勿得再逞。
    （５）各部队对于通讯、交通、运输、车辆等重要工具，尤其是联合动务机构及其部队，均未能妥加保管，注意维护（按：交通线这样长，那里保护得住？），致使军队行动迟缓，耽误时机，莫此为甚（按：又要行军，又要战斗，又要筑工事，又要维护交通，还要挨骂，行动怎能不迟缓）。今后高级指挥官更应亲自督察，经常检点，以免腐化与无谓之损坏（按：蒋之嫡系军队均在投机走私，吃空额，出卖军火，如何能不腐化，不损坏）。
    以上各项，均系一年以来历次战役中所获得之重要教训（按：重要教训是卖国外交、政治反动、经济崩溃、兵力不足、兵心厌战，蒋介石一条也没有检讨出来），各将领务须切实反省（按：蒋介石应该首先反省），遵照改进，勿蹈覆辙（按：依照蒋介石密令做去，必败无疑！）。至明年（三十六年度）上半年，各部队作战目标应以打通陇海、津浦、同蒲、平汉与中东铁路诸线，肃清冀鲁晋陕（按：包括延安在内）等地境内股匪（按：指人民解放军），以恢复全国往来交通，确保治安。（按：这是蒋介石半年的作战目标，于去年十二月三十日定出，足证今年一月里蒋介石提出的所谓“和谈”绝无丝毫诚意。但是，蒋介石这样的作战目标，莫说半年达不到，半世纪也达不到。人民解放军一定能够粉碎蒋军的进攻！）各战区及绥靖区主管长官，宜各就所辖地区，积极准备，完成各个所负之任务；尤其应准备山地战与机动战，以对奸匪之游击战。至对奸匪政训工作与情报、宣传等工作，更应特加研究，积极增强，以加速军事之效果。惟剿匪平乱，必须军事与政治互相配合（按：所以要通过伪宪，“改组政府”，加强特务相造谣等），收复区内之地方行政工作尤关重要（按：办法是把汉奸请回去加官进爵，组织特务恶霸还乡队，没收农民土地，屠杀爱国人民）；我军进占各匪区之后，必须督导我各级官兵，协助各级地方政府，注重民众组训，整理铠甲，加强人民之自卫力量（按：恶霸，汉奸，特务之武装），以安定地方秩序，恢复各种生产（按：即是劫收）。对于处理土地纠纷，尤应注重实行绥靖区减租法规（按：蒋介石最怕的是解放区土地改革），务使还者有其地（按：恶霸、汉奸、特务、军官有其地），此为我军与共匪政治斗争之基本问题，（按：反对解放区土地改革的“民主人士”听者！）务希我将领切实厉行，毋忽视古云“行百重者半九十”。当此国民大会（按：蒋记伪国大）圆满告成，宪法（按：蒋记法西斯伪宪）制定之际，国内国外对我国家政府与国军之观听为之一变（按：蒋介石想以伪国大与伪宪来孤立民主力量，结果却孤立了自己），匪军精神上无论其军事与政治各方面皆受最大致命之打击（按：此密令发出不久，我人民解放军消灭蒋军第二十六师、第五十七师、第一快速纵队及其他许多蒋伪军），我国军剿匪工作至此已达九死一生之时（按：到了走下坡路之时），只要我将领在今后一年期内（按：以前说是五个月）淬励精诚，奋发努力，彻底消灭（按：此之谓“政治解决”）万恶之奸匪（按：主张祖国独立和平民主的叫做“万恶奸匪”，蒋介石与汪精卫有什么区别？），扫除革命（按：法西斯反革命）之最后障碍（按：蒋介石是我国最后一个汉奸卖国贼和独裁魔王），则滔天大祸平于一旦，三民主义（按：应读作法西斯主义）实现于全国，乃可告慰我总理（按：孙中山的三民主义与国民党早被蒋介石篡夺了）与革命（按：革老百姓的命）阵亡将士之先烈（按：希特勒与汪精卫）在天之灵。我官兵之丰功伟绩（按：卖国之丰功，独裁之伟绩），且将永垂于国民革命光荣灿烂之史迹。（按：遗臭万年！）望各勉旃。
