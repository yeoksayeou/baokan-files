Summary of Mutual Aid Group Work

(1) Mutual aid group activities have existed in the past in the military, but they soon stopped without any formal announcement. Since the beginning of the self-defense war, mutual aid group activities have been re-launched in the military, starting with the mutual aid groups during marches before the Longhai Self-Defense Operation. At that time, they were only mutual aid groups for marching, and later gradually developed into combat and training, and then became combat and training mutual aid groups.

(2) This kind of mutual aid group is formed and developed under the combination of the soldiers' mass, high degree, marching, combat, training, political consciousness, and high degree of revolutionary friendship. That is to say, it is formed and developed by the combination of a high degree of political enthusiasm for fighting for the nation and the people, and mutual brotherly love. Now the vast majority of soldiers have deeply experienced the progress and strength that mutual aid groups have given them, so they say: "At home, we rely on our parents, but in revolution, we rely on mutual aid." This kind of mutual aid group is generally established within the squad. During marches, in order to ensure that everyone reaches the destination without anyone falling behind, under the guidance of the squad leader and deputy squad leader, mutual aid group leaders are democratically elected based on physical strength and marching ability, and freely combined to form two to three marching mutual aid groups (six to eight people form two, nine to twelve people form three mutual aid groups). The squad leader and deputy squad leader also join each mutual aid group separately. During the march, mutual aid work is carried out, such as helping the weak or those with difficulties to share the burden of carrying guns and supplies. During the march, we can see active members of the mutual aid groups vying to help those in need carry things, and encouraging and helping everyone to keep up with the team. During night marches, in order to avoid losing contact, some even hold a rope from the head of the squad to the end; the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and mutual aid group leaders almost always have a fixed position during the march. After arriving at the campsite, under the guidance of the squad leader and deputy squad leader, each mutual aid group is responsible for various services for setting up camp, such as: cleaning the barracks, tidying up bedding, publicizing to the masses, borrowing items, and boiling water. Before the battle is about to begin, within a squad, due to new tasks, new mobilization, and new requirements, the mutual aid group leader is re-elected and re-integrated. If the mutual aid group leader during the march is often elected for their strong marching ability, then the conditions for the mutual aid group leader here are that they are rich in combat experience and brave. During the battle, the squad leader almost directs the battle of one mutual aid group at a time, and each mutual aid group acts under the command of the squad leader towards a certain goal and task. What each mutual aid group is responsible for depends on the task assigned to that squad and the specific situation at the time. In short, during the battle, each group cooperates and supports each other, and each member within each group also takes care of each other, helps each other, and encourages each other at all times around the group leader. In the event of casualties, if a certain mutual aid group can no longer be a complete group, it will automatically join the neighboring group. If neither group is complete, they will quickly combine into one, and under the command of the squad leader, take on a certain task; when the squad leader and deputy squad leader are casualties, the mutual aid group leader will immediately replace the duties of the squad leader and deputy squad leader according to the order previously designated by the squad leader, and continue to command the battle until victory. In training: Under new and different tasks and requirements, mutual aid groups are formed and launched again in the military to carry out mutual aid activities for military and political study. Here, the conditions for the mutual aid group leader are combat experience, military skills, and political awareness. In addition to mutual aid groups in marching, combat, and training, there are also mutual aid groups of other natures (such as those for consolidating new soldiers or rectifying discipline).

(3) What are the benefits of this kind of mutual aid group? There are several benefits: First, in addition to the squad leader and deputy squad leader, it can bring into play the different strengths and roles of each member of the squad, which is convenient for cultivating activists. Second, with two to three mutual aid groups in a squad, there are two to three smaller groups, or smaller groups of soldiers, which makes it easier for the squad leader to command and control, and facilitates marching and training. Under the conditions of increased firepower, it is especially convenient for combat, and can reduce casualties. Moreover, because of the mutual aid groups, revolutionary competitions between the groups can often be inspired, which is much better, more detailed, and more organized than a squad leader commanding and managing seven or eight units of scattered soldiers. Third, the formation of mutual aid groups within the squad greatly increases the cohesiveness of the squad, which is enough to avoid the possible chaos or loss of control caused by the interruption of command and management due to the casualties of the squad leader, truly making each squad a strong organism that cannot be defeated.

(4) How to lead the activities of mutual aid groups? Mutual aid groups must first be possible under the condition of the soldiers' high degree of political consciousness and the combination of revolutionary friendship. After creating this foundation, the leadership should actively guide and help voluntary associations to form them, and pay attention to the appropriate allocation and adjustment of veteran soldiers, new soldiers, and liberated soldiers in the mutual aid groups. Without the above foundation, relying solely on orders to form them will have little effect. Secondly, the work content of mutual aid groups should be different according to the specific circumstances of the members of each group, the specific requirements, and the different development of political awareness. It is best to encourage each group to discuss and decide on its own. Therefore, the conditions and requirements are different, and there is no need to formulate general work regulations to force them to be consistent and reach the same level. If you force all groups to have the same requirements, it will become formulaic, rigid, and lifeless. Thirdly, the mutual aid group leader can generally be produced in a democratic way, but sometimes the squad leader can also adopt a method of half-designation and half-election. The group leader is still a general soldier in the military, not a cadre at a higher level. He is just a backbone core member of the soldiers. Therefore, the group leader does not issue orders in his work style, but adopts the method of uniting and organizing everyone to learn from each other and help each other, promoting everyone's enthusiasm, and implementing the squad leader's instructions. The conditions for the mutual aid group leader should be political firmness, bravery in combat, combat experience, prestige among the soldiers, physical strength, and willingness to help everyone. Some combat heroes are the best mutual aid group leaders. Furthermore, there are two procedures for forming a group: first elect the group leader, and then freely combine to form a group, or first freely combine to form a group and then elect the group leader; both methods are acceptable. Finally, after the mutual aid group is formed, the leadership of the group leader should be strengthened, his progress should be helped, his ability should be improved, and the experience of the mutual aid group should be summarized and introduced at any time to improve it. At the same time, every Communist Party member should be mobilized to play a exemplary role in mutual aid and become an activist in the mutual aid group. Of course, some party members can also be elected as mutual aid group leaders.

    关于互助组工作总结
    （一）互助组的活动过去部队也曾有过，不过不久又无形的停止了。自卫战争开始以后，互助组的活动从新在部队中开展起来，开始于陇海自卫作战以前的行军中，当时仅为行军中的互助小组，后来逐渐发展到战斗和练兵中，又变成为战斗的和练兵的互助组。
    （二）这种互助组是在战士群众性的、高度的、行军的、战斗的、练兵的、政治觉悟性与高度的革命友爱相结合之下形成起来发展起来的。也就是说，高度的为民族和人民而战的政治热忱和相互之间的兄弟的热爱的结合形成起来发展起来的。现在广大的战士已经深深体验到互助组给予自己的进步和力量，所以他们说：“在家靠父母，革命靠互助。”这种互助组，一般的建立在班内，在行军中为了保证每一个人到达目的地，没有一个掉队落伍的。在正副班长指导下，根据体力和行军力的强弱，民主的选举互助组长，并自由的结合起来形成两个到三个行军互助组，（六人到八人建立两个，九人到十二人建立三个互助小组。）正副班长亦分别加入各互助组内，在行军中展开帮助体弱的或有困难的同志分担背枪背东西等互助工作。在行军中，我们可以随时见到互助组中的积极分子争着帮助有困难者背东西，鼓励和帮助每一个人跟上队伍。夜间行军为了不致失联络，有的甚至从班头到班尾拿着一条绳子；正副班长和互助组长在行军中几乎都有一定的位置。到达宿营地以后，在正副班长指导之下，各互助组分头担任设营的各种服务。如：打扫营舍、整理铺盖、宣传群众、借物、烧水等。在战斗快要到来之前，在一个班内又因新的任务、新的动员和新的要求，从新选举互助组长从新结合起来。如果行军中互助组长常是选举行军力强的话，这里的互助组长条件，则是要富于战斗经验和英勇的。在战斗过程中，班长几乎是指挥一个一个互助小组进行战斗，每一个互助小组则在班长指挥之下向一定的目标和任务活动着，究竟那一个互助组担任什么，要以那个班所受领的任务和当时具体情况如何而定。总之，在战斗过程中各小组之间是相互配合策应着，每一个小组以内的各个成员亦是时时刻刻的在组长周围相互关照相互援助、相互鼓励着。如遇伤亡，某一互助小组已不能成为完整小组时，便自动加入友邻小组，两个小组都不完整时，则迅速结合为一，在班长指挥之下担任一定的任务；正副班长伤亡时，互助组长即根据班长事前所已经指定的次序立即代替正副班长的职务，继续指挥战斗，直到战斗胜利。在练兵中：在新的不同的任务和要求下，互助组又在部队中从新形成和开展其军事政治学习的互助活动，这里互助组长的条件是战斗经验、军事技术、政治觉悟等。除行军、战斗、练兵等场合之下的互助组以外，有时也还有其他性质的（如有时巩固新战士或整顿纪律的等）互助组的形成与活动。
    （三）这种互助组有什么好处呢？有这样几个好处：第一、在一个班内除正副班长以外，能够发挥班内各个分子不同的特长和作用，便利于培养积极分子。第二、在一个班内有了二个到三个互助小组，则一个班内有了两个到三个更小的集团，或更小的兵群，班长便利于指挥掌握，便利于行军、练兵，在火力增强的条件下尤其便利于战斗，又可减少伤亡。而且因有互助组的缘故，常能启发各组间的革命竞赛，较之一个班长指挥管理七八个单位的散兵好得多，细织得多，有组织得多。第三、班内互助组的形成，大大的增进了一个班内的凝结力，这样足以避免因班长伤亡指挥管理中断所引起的可能的混乱或失去掌握，真是做到每一个班成为一种走不垮打不烂的坚强的机体。
    （四）如何领导互助组的活动呢？互助组首先必须是在战士高度的政治觉悟性和革命友爱相结合的条件下才有可能。造成了这种基础之后，领导上即积极从旁指导帮助自愿结合组成，并注意老战士、新战士、解放战士在互助组中之适当配当和调剂。没有上述基础，单纯依靠命令组成，作用是小的。其次，互助组的工作内容是要按各组内成员的具体情况，具体要求政治觉悟程度的发展不同而各有不同，最好推动各组自己去讨论决定，因此条件和要求各有差别，不必去制定一般的工作条例，勉强求其一致和达到一样水准。如果勉强去规定所有小组一样的要求，就会公式化、死板化、没生气。再其次，互助组长一般可采取民主方式产生，但有时亦可经过班长采取半指定及半选举通过的办法产生。组长在军事上仍然是一个一般的战士，不是一级干部。他只是战士中的骨干核心分子，因此组长在工作方式上不是发号施令，而是采取团结和组织大家互学互助，发扬大家积极性，贯彻班长的指示。互助组长的条件应该是政治坚定，作战勇敢，有战斗经验，在战士中有威信，身体强壮而又肯于帮助大家的，有些战斗英雄就是最好的互助组长。再则小组的组成可以有两种程序：先选举组长，然后自由结合成小组，或先自由结合组成小组再选组长；两种办法均可。最后，互助小组形成后，应加强对组长的领导，帮助他的进步，提高他的能力，并随时总结和介绍互助小组的经验，使其提高。同时应动员每个共产党员在互助中起模范作用，成为互助组中的积极分子。当然，有的党员一样可以选为互助组长。
