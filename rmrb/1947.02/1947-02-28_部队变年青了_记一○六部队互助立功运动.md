　　The Troops Have Become Younger
    On the Mutual Assistance and Merit Campaign of the 106th Regiment
    Ze Ran
    "Officers and soldiers, together with the people, should use every possible means to fight the enemy... This is the reason why we are invincible." Commander-in-Chief Zhu, in his discussion of the Liberated Areas battlefield, once issued this call to the People's Army on the lines and methods of leading troops. The mutual assistance and merit campaign of the 106th Regiment is another good example of promoting "everyone thinking of ways" and "everyone offering ideas." Relying on this method of employing troops, the 106th Regiment has become an even more invincible force, and is becoming younger and younger through battle.
    To this end, the reporter interviewed the political commissar of the 106th Regiment. They only shifted their attention to this aspect and raised it to a level of consciousness three months ago, after the Battle of Huaxian. He said: Before that, we had participated in many victorious battles, but regrettably, we had never achieved the goal of thoroughly and completely eliminating the enemy, which greatly stimulated all officers and soldiers. After the Battle of Huaxian, the regiment held a congress of heroes during a lull in the fighting, and each company selected heroes and models. Only then did the leadership realize that many creations, experiences, and talents at the lower levels had not been promoted, and that they had not yet mastered the mass line in their methods of leading troops. Therefore, the regimental party committee made a special decision to change its style of work and follow the mass line, and humbly observed and learned from other fraternal units. When the leadership turned to the masses, everyone's enthusiasm and creativity were constantly discovered and promoted.
    In order to promote the enthusiasm of the masses, we focused on the Merit Committee. The 7th Company of a certain regiment first used an old soldier named Bai as a typical example to enlighten everyone. This soldier had been wounded and awarded merit in the Xiangtangpu battle. Later, he did administrative work in the company. For many years, he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the entire company. He won the sincere love of all the soldiers in the company and was also loved by the people, who helped him find a wife. Why was this person able to win the support of the masses? Should he be awarded merit? This sparked a lively discussion and reflection. Everyone deeply examined their own past and expressed their determination to perform meritorious service for the people in the future. Thus, on the basis of awareness and willingness, the first Merit Committee in the company was established. This experience was quickly promoted, and the Merit Committees of each company were rapidly and universally established.
    The Merit Committee focuses on the company level. It is elected democratically by company heroes, models, and party, government, and military cadres. It is a mass organization within the unit that regularly conducts merit evaluation and recording. Every soldier, regardless of any excellent performance in any area, the Merit Committee immediately leads everyone to evaluate the merit and record his achievements in the merit book. From then on, the slogan "Perform meritorious service for the people" became the most powerful action slogan for promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of every soldier.
    This merit campaign initially started from the operational aspect. After the regiment's congress of heroes, various heroes and creations in combat increased rapidly. At the congress of heroes of a certain unit after capturing Chengwu, the number of heroes and models in killing the enemy more than doubled, which played a significant role in improving the combat effectiveness of the unit. This merit campaign was even more effective in training troops, and training quickly became a craze. Many squads and platoons automatically practiced hard day and night, and made rapid progress. In terms of technology, all kinds of new creations and methods, such as destroying the enemy's concealed bunkers in Luzhai, and skillfully passing through the water surface of the outer moat, were devised. Later, this movement developed into all aspects of the unit, creating many methods in the relationship between the military and the people, in the life of the unit, and in the mutual assistance of the unit's marching, and many heroes and models emerged. These creations and inventions were quickly spread throughout the army through newspapers such as "Strive for Glory" and "Merit," and became examples for everyone to learn from. At the congresses of heroes held in various units, in addition to giving spiritual and material rewards to these meritorious heroes, the units also sent representatives to each other, carrying gifts to express condolences and encouragement (such as infantry sending things to the engineers, writing letters of condolence, infantry writing letters to the artillery, thanking them for their close cooperation, etc.). This mutual praise and encouragement made the soldiers' enthusiasm for performing meritorious service and killing the enemy even higher.
    In order to make the glory of the soldiers' meritorious service become the glory of the soldiers' entire hometown, the 106th Regiment created a method of reporting merit after the Juye campaign. The achievements of each soldier were reported by the political organs of the unit to the local government, and then the government sent a special person to report the merit to the soldier's family. This kind of merit reporting encouraged the family members to hope that the soldiers would bravely kill the enemy on the front line, and the soldiers on the front line also doubled their efforts to perform meritorious service in order to win more glory.
    The merit campaign quickly promoted the army's killing-the-enemy competition. This competition drew in every part of the army. When the infantry put forward its own goal of competing for merit, it was not only to eliminate the enemy and capture more weapons and personnel, but also to further focus on new discoveries and new creations in combat methods. The engineers and artillerymen studied how to open the way for the infantry in time, the medical and health personnel studied how to reduce the suffering of the wounded, and the communicators and telephone operators ensured that communication was maintained under any circumstances... In the face of the army-wide competition for merit, all amazing creations for killing the enemy emerged in the face of the wisdom of the masses.
    Another method of promoting the soldiers' enthusiasm and creativity is to organize mutual assistance groups. This is the most basic mass organization of the unit. It is a good way for the unit's small group movement and the three types of people in the unit (old soldiers, new soldiers, and liberated soldiers) to help each other, improve each other, and adjust each other in combat training and life. Before the battle, these mutual assistance groups mainly discussed the implementation of the orders from the higher levels, mobilized everyone to think of ways, and everyone offered ideas, so that every soldier felt that there were ways to fight and had confidence, and the resolutions of the higher levels became the conscious resolutions of each soldier, and everyone was determined to complete them thoroughly. After the war, the mutual assistance groups mainly conducted combat reviews and summaries. In training, the old soldiers of the mutual assistance groups mainly promoted their tactical thinking and leading role; the newly liberated soldiers of the mutual assistance groups promoted their military technology, because they knew the characteristics and weaknesses of the enemy, and could provide many technologies for eliminating the enemy, destroying enemy obstacles, and building defensive fortifications; the new soldiers of the mutual assistance groups promoted their high learning enthusiasm and quickly learned the skills they urgently needed.
    Recently, in order to expand the individual's meritorious service into collective meritorious service, and to make the unit's mass organization a unified organization, the 106th Regiment unified the Merit Committee and the Mutual Assistance Group into the "Mutual Assistance and Merit Committee." Their slogan is: "Carry out a mutual assistance-based merit campaign."
    After three months of the mutual assistance and merit campaign, the enthusiasm and creativity of everyone in the 106th Regiment have been brought into play. All the difficulties encountered in the unit have been quickly overcome in the face of the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses. The leadership of the unit and the masses are more closely integrated. Everyone in the unit now feels more than ever that there are ways to work and that they have confidence. The entire unit is even more vibrant. The test of these achievements is the glorious battle record of the unit's self-defense operations last month. Last month, they carried out four major annihilation battles in a row (the Battle of Yangzhuang in Yutai, the Battle of Chengwu in Juye, and the Battle of Shanxian). In addition to thoroughly and completely eliminating the enemy, they also recovered the three cities of Juye, Chengwu, and Shanxian, and captured 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops alive.
    Now, the 106th Regiment is no longer the thirty-something-year-old that it was once compared to. They have become younger!

　　部队变年青了
    记一○六部队互助立功运动
    泽然
    “官兵与人民，人人想尽一切办法打敌人，……这就是我们战无不胜的道理。”朱总司令在论解放区战场中，曾这样召示人民军队带兵的路线与方法。一○六部队的互助立功运动，就是发扬“人人想办法”“大家出主意”的又一好榜样。靠着这种用兵方法，一○六部队更加成了战无不胜的劲旅，而且愈战愈年青了。
    为此，记者走访了一○六部队政治委员。他们把注意力转到这方面来，并提高为意识化，还只是三个月前滑县战役后的事。他说：在这以前，我们曾参加了多次胜利的战斗；遗憾的都没有达到干脆彻底消灭敌人的要求，这给全体官兵的刺激很大。滑县战役以后，部队在战争空隙中召开了群英大会，每连都选有英雄和模范。这次领导上才认识了下边有许多创造、许多经验、许多人才都没有被发扬，在带兵方法上还没有掌握群众路线。因此部队党委会专门作了转变作风、走群众路线的决定，并虚心向旁的弟兄部队进行观摩学习。当领导上面向着群众的时候，大家的积极性、创造性就不断被发现和得到了发扬。
    为了发扬群众的积极性，我们抓紧了立功委员会。某团七连首先把一个姓白的老战士作为典型启发大家。这个战士在向堂铺战斗中就负过伤立过功，后来在连上作事务工作，多年来不辞辛苦为全连改善生活，获得全连战士的衷心爱戴，也受到老百姓的爱护，替他娶了老婆。这个人为什么能受群众的拥护呢？他应不应立功？由此引起大家的热烈讨论、反省。每个人都深刻的检讨自己的过去，表示今后要为人民立功的决心。于是在自觉自愿的基础上，建立了连队中第一个立功委员会。这一经验很快推广，各连队的立功委员会就迅速普遍的建立起来。
    立功委员会重点放在连队里。由连队英雄模范及党政军干部经过民主选举后产生。它是部队中一种群众性的组织，它经常进行评功与记功。每个战士，不管在任何方面表现出优良的成绩，立功委员会便立即领导大家评功，把他的功迹记在功劳簿上。从此，“为人民立功”的口号，就成为发扬每个战士积极性创造性的最有力的行动口号。
    这个立功运动，最初是从作战方面开始的。部队群英大会以后，战斗中的各种英雄和创造，就飞速的增加了。某部在攻克城武后的群英大会上，杀敌英雄与模范即增加到两倍以上，这对部队战斗力的提高起了极大作用。这个立功运动，在练兵方面收效更大，很快练兵就形成热潮，不少班排，自动不分昼夜的苦练，进步极快。在技术方面，为破坏鹿寨暗堡。以及巧妙通过外壕水面等各种新创造、新办法，都尽力想出来了。以后这个运动又发展到部队的各个方面，使部队在军民关系上、部队生活上、以及部队行军互助上，都创造出了许多办法来，涌现出许多英雄和模范。这些创造与发明，通过部队所出的“争光”“立功”等报纸，又很快传播到全军，成为大家学习的榜样。在各部举行的群英大会上，除对这些立功英雄予以精神和物质的奖励外，各部之间也互派代表，携带礼物，进行慰问和鼓励（如步兵给工兵送东西，写慰问信，步兵给炮兵写信，感谢他们的密切配合等等）。这种互相的表扬和鼓励，使部队战士的立功杀敌情绪更加高涨。
    为了使战士立功的光荣，成为战士全家乡的光荣，一○六部队在巨野作战后，又创造了报功办法。部队每个战士的功绩，都由部队政治机关，报功给地方政府，再由政府专人向战士家庭报功。这种报功的鼓舞，使家属更希望战士在前线英勇杀敌，前线战士也为争取更多的光荣而加倍的立功。
    立功运动很快推动了部队的杀敌竞赛。这个竞赛使部队每一部分都卷进去了。当步兵提出自己竞赛立功的目标时，已不只是消灭敌人和多缴人枪，而且要进一步着重在作战方法上有新发现和新创造。工兵们、炮兵们则是研究如何作到及时给步兵开路，医务卫生人员们，则是如何减少伤员的痛苦，通讯员、电话员则是保证在任何情况下保持联络，……在全军竞赛立功的面前，一切惊人的杀敌创造，都在群众的智慧面前产生了。
    发扬战士积极性、创造性的另一方法，是组织互助组，这是部队最基础的群众组织，是适合于部队小兵群运动与部队三种人（老战士、新战士、解放战士）在战斗练兵及生活中互相帮助互相提高互相调剂的好办法。这种互助组，在战斗前，主要是讨论贯彻上级的命令，发动大家想办法，人人出主意，使每个战士打仗都感到有办法，有信心，上级的决议都成为每个战士自己自觉的决议，大家都坚决彻底去完成。战争之后，互助组主要是进行作战检讨与总结。在练兵中，互助组的老战士主要发扬他的战术思想与带头作用；互助组的新解放战士，则发扬他的军事技术，因为他深知敌人的特点与弱点，可以提供许多消灭敌人破坏敌人障碍，修筑防御工事的技术，互助组的新战士则发扬他的高度学习热情，飞快的学会急切需要的本事。
    最近，一○六部队为了把个人的立功，扩大成为集体性的立功，并使部队的群众组织成为统一的组织，他们就把立功委员会与互助组统一成为“互助立功委员会”。他们的口号是：“开展互助性的立功运动”。
    经过三月互助立功运动的一○六部队，人人的积极性和创造性都发扬起来了。部队中碰到的一切困难，在群众智慧与群众积极性的面前，都迅速的克服了。部队的领导与群众日益密切的结合起来了。部队的每一个人，现在比任何时候都更感到工作有了办法，有了信心。整个部队更其朝气勃勃，这些成绩的考验，就是上月份该部自卫作战的辉煌战迹。上月全月，他们连续进行了四次大的歼灭战斗（鱼台杨庄之战，巨野城武及单县之战），除干脆彻底的消灭敌人外，还收复了巨野城武单县三城，生俘蒋军一万人。
    现在，一○六部队已经不是过去曾经比喻过的三十多岁的人了，他们变年青了！
