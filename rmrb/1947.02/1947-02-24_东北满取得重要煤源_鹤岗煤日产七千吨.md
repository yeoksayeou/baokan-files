Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th: Our special correspondent Liu Boyu reports: The reporter visited the Hegang coal-producing area, forty li north of Jiamusi, famous in the Northeast, and witnessed the workers' enthusiastic production. The red flags of outstanding competition are being contested by various mining areas and displayed everywhere. According to company manager Min Yifan, the coal reserves in Hegang reach 600 billion tons, and its production is in its prime. Although the number of workers is less than in the past, the output has more than doubled (it is reported that the maximum daily output is 7,500 tons), making it the main supply base of coal in Northeast Manchuria.

　　Since August 15th, many outstanding heroes have emerged here. Tian Gongchuan thwarted the Japanese attempt to blow up the mine, and single-handedly guarded the power plant, maintaining all the machinery, keeping it running without stopping for a moment. He said, "I've been longing for this, finally the sky is clear!" Young worker Zhang Jixiang repaired the No. 1013 grinding motor car (this car has traction and can pull twenty coal cars each time). Japanese technicians had not repaired it for five years, and it had been burned by electric fire and sent to the hospital. But he insisted on repairing it, determined to "burn myself to death, I will repair it", and finally succeeded. Three coal miners overcame all difficulties and restored production to the Xinshan New Third Coal Mine, which had been closed for a year due to fire.

　　Compared with the past, today's workers' lives have entered another world. During the enemy occupation, workers had to work at least twelve hours a day, and at least four or five lives were lost every day. The foremen whipped and drove the workers into the mine. Now they work eight hours a day, and no worker has been injured. The company pays for medical treatment when workers are ill. Workers eat white flour for every meal, and the workers' quarters were filled with meat during the Spring Festival. A batch of tables and chairs were piled up in the courtyard of the workers' quarters. The workers are preparing to start regular studies. When Tian Chuan led the reporter to visit the warehouse, he took out a bunch of keys from under his cotton-padded jacket and said with a smile: "Chinese people were not allowed to enter the warehouse before, but now it's our world, and it's hanging on our workers' waists."

### 东北满取得重要煤源  鹤岗煤日产七千吨

　　东北满取得重要煤源
    鹤岗煤日产七千吨
    【新华社东北十八日电】本社特派记者刘伯羽报导：记者访问了佳木斯北四十华里，驰名东北的鹤岗产煤区，目睹工人热烈生产情形，一面竞赛优胜的红旗，被各矿区争夺着开展各处。据公司经理闵一帆谈称：鹤岗煤藏量达六千亿吨，出产正当青年期，工人虽比过去少，产量却提高了一倍以上（据悉最高日产七千五百吨）成为东北满煤源主要供给地。
    从八一五开始，这里涌现了不少杰出的英雄。田工川阻止了日寇企图炸毁矿山的阴谋，一人坚守发电所，保持全部机械，使它一刻未停止转动。他说：“盼星星盼月亮好容易才露了青天了！”青年工人张吉祥修理一○一三号磨电机车（这车牵引力，每一次能拉二十车箱煤），日技师五年来没有修好，曾被电火烧坏，送入医院。但他坚持修理，决心“烧死我也要修”，终于成功。三个掘煤工人克服一切困难，使因发火而封闭一年的兴山区新三煤矿恢复生产。
    和过去比较，今天的工人生活进入了另一个世界。敌占时工人每天最少要工作十二小时，每天要丧掉四五条人命，工头天天鞭打着赶工人下窑。现在每天工作八小时，没有一个工人受过伤害，工人患病时公司发给疗养费。工人每餐吃白面，春节时工房内摆满了肉食，工房院子里堆着一批桌椅，工人们准备开始正规学习，为田川引记者参观仓库时他从棉袄下摸出一串钥匙笑着说：“从前不准中国人接进仓库，现在是咱们的天下了，这就挂在咱工人腰上。”
