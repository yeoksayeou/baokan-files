    Land Reform Achieved in Shi Min and Five Other Counties; Entering Re-examination Stage, Preparing for Spring Plowing
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 9th] Shi Min, Jincheng, Gaoping, Jiyuan, and Wangwu five counties in the twenty-first district, have basically completed the land reform, and are now entering the re-examination stage and preparing for spring plowing. The border areas of Jiyuan and Wangwu continue to carry out armed land protection movements. In the general liquidation and complete liberation, the methods used varied from county to county due to different circumstances. Shi Min adopted two methods: The first was to first inspire landless and land-poor peasants to complain about their suffering and demand land, and then guide the masses to identify their targets and wage struggles. In villages that adopted this method, a large number of activists emerged from the landless and land-poor peasants, and the fighting spirit was unprecedentedly high. The second was to use cadres and activists as leaders, and then mobilize the broad masses to fill in the gaps. At the beginning of the movement in Jincheng, one-sided emphasis on the equal distribution of land harmed the interests of middle peasants in many villages. The leadership corrected this in a timely manner, held heart-to-heart talks with middle peasants, organized peasant unity meetings, compensated middle peasants for their losses, and corrected the donation of land by middle peasants, which put the movement on the right track and made a relatively thorough job of filling in the gaps. As the masses of Dayang Village said: "Patch the tears, fill the holes, and don't touch the middle peasants," only then can the feudal forces be defeated. Jiyuan's slogan is that landlords and tenants, poor and middle peasants are one family, unite to fight against landlords and despots, and ensure that middle peasants also benefit. Their method is to inspire the masses to demand land, and then discuss who to demand it from, so that the peasants direct the spearhead of their struggle at landlords and local bullies, and any land donated by middle peasants is rejected. The mountain villages in Wangwu are scattered, so they adopted the method of "eating from a big pot and holding big meetings," concentrating their firepower to carry out a liquidation and distribution with landlords and local bullies in one go. As a result, the movement developed rapidly, and is now undergoing the final re-examination in preparation for spring plowing. In the border areas of Jiyuan and Wangwu, they are first unifying various armed forces such as guerrillas and militia, carrying a gun in one hand and calculating accounts in the other, launching military and political offensives against the enemy,打击打“倒算队”打, and covering a large number of cadres who go deep into the enemy-occupied villages to lead the masses in secret preparations and even separate struggles, distribute as they fight, with a narrow struggle front and a wide distribution range. After the land distribution, they called for an armed land protection movement.

    士敏等五县实现土地改革
    进入复查准备春耕
    【本报太岳九日电】二十一分区士敏、晋城、高平、济源、王屋五县，基本上已完成土地改革，现已进入复查及准备春耕；济源、王屋之边沿区，继续开展武装保田运动。在总清算齐翻身中，因各县的情况不同，进行方法亦各异，士敏分两种作法：第一种首先启发无地少地的贫苦农民诉苦要地，再诱导群众认清目标进行斗争。采取此种方法的村庄、从无地少地的贫苦农民中，涌现出大批积极分子，斗争情绪空前高涨。另一种是通过干部与积极分子带头，进而发动广大群众进行填补。晋城在运动开始时，因片面强调平均土地，致使许多村庄伤害了中农利益，领导上及时纠正，开中农谈心会、农民团结会，赔偿了中农损失，纠正了中农献田，才使运动走向正轨，进行了比较彻底的填平补齐。正如大阳村群众说：“补布绽、填窟窿、中农不准动”，然后才能打垮封建势力。济源的口号是雇佃贫中是一家，团结起来斗争地主和奸霸，而且使中农得到利益。其作法是启发群众要田，然后再讨论向谁要？使农民将斗争锋芒指向地主、恶霸，中农献田，一律谢绝。王屋山地村庄分散，采取了“大锅吃饭开大会”，集中火力与地主恶霸进行一次清算一次分配，因此运动迅速发展，现在正进行最后复查，准备春耕。济源与王屋之边沿区，进行一手持枪一手算账首先统一游击队民兵等各种武装力量，向敌展开军事、政治攻势，打击了“倒算队”，并掩护大批干部深入接敌区村庄，领导群众秘密酝酿以至分开斗争，随斗随分，斗争面窄分配面宽，土地分配后，又号召进行武装保田运动。
