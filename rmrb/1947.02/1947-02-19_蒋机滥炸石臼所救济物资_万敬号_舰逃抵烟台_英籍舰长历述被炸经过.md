Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 17th: The "Wan Jing," a transport landing ship under the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) which narrowly escaped after being bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes in Shijiusuo, arrived in Yantai on the afternoon of the 9th. Wang Yunjiu, Secretary-General of the Shandong CRRRA office, along with representatives from the Jiaodong Liberated Area Relief Committee and the Yantai Municipal Government, made a special trip to the dock to express their condolences and host a banquet. Captain MacCork, the British captain of the ship, recounted the bombing: "On the 4th of this month, the 'Wan Jing' set sail from Shanghai, carrying 800 tons of relief supplies bound for the Shandong Liberated Area. At 9:00 AM on the 6th, we arrived at the designated port of Shijiusuo. Just as we were preparing to unload the cargo, two Kuomintang planes suddenly flew in from the direction of Qingdao. After circling and reconnoitering, they flew away, but at 12:25 PM, they turned back and bombed the ship from an altitude of 3,000 meters. The first bomb landed and exploded 20 yards from the stern, while the second and third landed and exploded on either side. Facing this unexpected attack, the ship had no choice but to sail to Yantai without unloading. As a result, all the urgently needed relief supplies destined for Linyi had to be left here." He continued, "The ship is American-made, and the planes are also American-made. Knowing it was a relief ship, they still bombed it relentlessly. I don't understand the reasoning!" The ship left Yantai on the 12th and returned to Shanghai.

　　蒋机滥炸石臼所救济物资
    “万敬号”舰逃抵烟台
    英籍舰长历述被炸经过
    【新华社山东十七日电】在石臼所横遭蒋机轰炸脱逃之行总运输登陆舰“万敬号”，于九日下午驶抵烟台。山东行总办事处秘书主任王云九偕胶东解放区救济委员及烟市政府代表，特赶赴码头慰问，并设宴招待。该舰英籍舰长麦克考克历述被炸经过：“本月四日，‘万敬号’由沪启碇，载有运往山东解放区救济物资八百吨，六日上午九时即抵达指定海口石臼所，正待卸货，突由青岛方面飞来国民党机两架，在上空盘旋侦察后飞去，十二点二十五分忽又转回，在三千米达高空向本舰投弹轰炸，第一颗炸弹在舰尾二十码处落海爆炸，第二、第三颗落于左右两侧爆炸。本舰遭此意外，不及卸货，即驶来烟，故所有急需运往临沂之救济物资，亦只能留此搁置。”继称：“船是美国制的，飞机也是美国制的，明知是救济船仍狂加轰炸，不知是何道理！”该舰已于十二日离烟返沪。
