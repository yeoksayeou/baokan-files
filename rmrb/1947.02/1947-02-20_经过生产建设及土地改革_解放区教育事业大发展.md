    Education in the Liberated Areas Greatly Develops
    The Four Liberated Areas of Northeast China, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Have Seven Universities, Two Hundred Middle Schools, and More Than Eighty Thousand Primary Schools
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th】School education and social education in the Liberated Areas have undergone significant development in recent years. According to statistics from the four liberated areas of Northeast China, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia at the end of last year: there are seven universities with 12,100 students, 210 middle schools with 69,560 students, and 87,898 primary schools with 4,853,072 students. University and middle school education is most developed in the Northeast, with four universities, 9,000 students; and 93 middle schools with 36,000 students. Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region and Shandong are next, the former has one university with 1,500 students, 65 middle schools with 11,464 students; the latter has one university with 1,200 students, and 45 middle schools with 19,290 students. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has one university with 400 students, and seven middle schools with 2,806 students. Primary school education is most developed in Shandong, with 30,292 primary schools and 1,952,934 students. Next is the Northeast, with more than 12,000 primary schools and 1,532,450 students. The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has 793 higher primary schools with 100,585 students; 43,510 lower primary schools with 1,226,204 students. Primary schools in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are divided into private and public, the former has 940 schools with 15,373 students; the latter has 363 schools with 20,931 students. The further development of production and construction and the vigorous land reform movement after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan are powerful factors promoting the vigorous development of education. For example, in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, compared with the past, the number of middle schools has increased three times, the number of higher primary schools has increased by 130%, the number of lower primary schools has increased by 145%, and the number of lower primary school students has increased eight times. In addition to school education, various forms of social education suitable for the rural environment are also very developed. Shandong has 23,130 national primary schools that combine production and learning, with 1,355,852 students; 22,934 night schools with more than 1,180,800 students. There are 11,317 literacy groups with 171,117 members. The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has 21,391 winter schools with 1,696,696 students. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has 3,000 winter schools with 50,000 students. Blackboards, known as "rural broadcasting stations," are extremely common. There are 3,174 in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area alone. In addition, rural theater troupes and yangko dance teams organized and performed by farmers themselves are active in the countryside during rural festivals, vividly expressing the joy of the liberated Chinese peasants.

　　经过生产建设及土地改革
    解放区教育事业大发展
    东北、晋冀鲁豫、山东、陕甘宁四解放区有大学七所中学二百所小学八万余所              
    【新华社延安十五日电】解放区学校教育与社会教育数年来有重大发展，截至去年底。据东北、晋冀鲁豫、山东和陕甘宁四个解放区的统计：有大学七所，学生一万二千一百人，中学二百十所，学生六万九千五百六十人，小学八万七千八百九十八所，学生四百八十五万三千零七十二人。大学和中学教育，以东北最发达，计有大学四所，学生九千人；中学九十三所，学生三万六千人。晋冀鲁豫边区和山东次之，前者有大学一所，学生一千五百人，中学六十五所，学生一万一千四百六十四人；后者有大学一所，学生一千二百人，中学四十五所，学生一万九千二百九十人。陕甘宁边区有大学一所，学生四百人，中学七所，学生二千八百零六人。小学教育以山东最发达，有小学三万零二百九十二所，学生一百九十五万二千九百三十四人。其次是东北，有小学一万二千余所，学生一百五十三万二千四百五十人。晋冀鲁豫边区有高小七百九十三所，学生十万零五千一百八十五人；初小四万三千五百十所，学生一百二十二万六千二百零四人。陕甘宁边区小学分私办和公办两种，前者有九百四十所，学生一万五千三百七十三人；后者有三百六十三所，学生二万零九百三十一人。抗战胜利后，生产建设的进一步发展和轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动，是促进教育事业蓬勃发展的有力因素。例如晋冀鲁豫边区，现在和过去相比，中学数增加三倍，高小数增加百分之一百三十，初小数增加百分之一百四十五，初小生增加八倍。除了学校教育以外，适合农村环境的各种社会教育也很发达。山东有生产和学习结合的国民小学二万三千一百三十处，学生一百三十五万五千八百五十二人；夜校二万二千九百三十四处，学生一百十八万零八百余名。识字组一万一千三百一十七个，组员十七万一千一百十七名。晋冀鲁豫边区有冬学二万一千三百九十一处，有学生一百六十九万六千六百九十六人。陕甘宁边区有冬学三千所，学生五万人。被称为“农村广播台”的黑板报，极为普遍，晋冀鲁豫解放区一地就有三千一百七十四处，此外由农民自己组织并演出的农村剧团和秧歌队，每当农村年节时，即活跃乡间，解放了的中国农民的欢欣，都有生动的表现。
