Rewarding Inventions Beneficial to the People
　　Taihang Administrative Office Allocates Huge Bonuses
　　[This newspaper's Taihang News] The Taihang Administrative Office recently allocated 440,000 yuan as production and construction bonuses to reward mass creativity and inventions. The first recipients are the Guanhe Bridge recently completed in Wuxiang, the man-powered vehicle created by the Wuxiang Tool Factory, and the blower jointly researched and installed by the Huguan County Tool Factory and the Baichi Iron Industry Cooperative. The Administrative Office believes that the construction of the Guanhe Bridge has greatly facilitated east-west transportation and has significant economic value. Moreover, the people of Wuxiang, under today's conditions of backward technology and material shortages, overcame the extremely difficult Guanhe River with a hundredfold of effort, which is a great achievement. In addition to allocating 300,000 yuan in construction funds for subsidies, the Administrative Office also issued a commendation order for Li Xingtang, the construction section chief of the county, for his active planning of the bridge construction project, awarding him a bonus of 10,000 yuan. The man-powered vehicle can carry more than 300 jin and is easy to pull by one person, making a significant contribution to the transportation industry. A commendation order was issued for workers Jia Zhihou and others, awarding them a bonus of 50,000 yuan. The creation of the blower has greatly increased iron production, and it has already been widely promoted. In addition to issuing a commendation order for the Huguan Tool Factory, a bonus of 80,000 yuan was awarded.
