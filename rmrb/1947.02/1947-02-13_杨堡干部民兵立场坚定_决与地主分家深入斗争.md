    Yangbao Cadres and Militia Firmly Stand Their Ground:
    Determined to Break with Landlords and Deepen the Struggle
    [Our Dispatch] In the in-depth movement in Yangbao Village, Changzhi, cadres and the masses are resolutely breaking with the landlords, thwarting their conspiracies to buy them off with kinship ties, money, and women. Although the village has undergone several struggles, unscrupulous landlords are still trying every means to hide their feudal tails. The landlord Zhu Banzhao attempted to evade the struggle by luring the village head Jia Mao, promising to give his daughter to the village head's younger brother as a wife. Jia stood firm, immediately exposing him in public, arousing the anger of the masses. Zhu had to confess his sinister plan to sell land and hide money while waiting for the situation to change. The landlord ×× instructed his mother to win over his nephew, the militiaman Qi Pangzhi, saying, "Others are struggling against your aunt, can you struggle against your aunt?!" Pangzhi said, "What aunt or auntie, I won't carry these sentimental burdens!" The landlord Zheng Sanzhi's mother used two thousand yuan to buy off a neighboring militiaman, Xiao Sanhai. Sanhai took the money and pretended to say, "Right! Right! Do you still have silver dollars hidden? Tell me, so I can help you cover them up." After Sanhai found out, he immediately reported to the cadres, recovered the silver dollars, and returned them to the masses. Under their influence, the deceived old farmhand Changfa, and Lin Han's wife, who washed clothes for the landlord, became active members in the struggle against the landlords.
