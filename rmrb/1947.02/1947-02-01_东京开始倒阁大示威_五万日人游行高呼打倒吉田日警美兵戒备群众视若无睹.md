　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Tokyo: The long-planned cabinet overthrow demonstration was launched on the morning of the 28th. 50,000 workers from the Government and Public Servants Workers' Union held a mass rally in the Imperial Palace Plaza, shouting "Down with the Yoshida Cabinet!" and marched after the meeting. The demonstration, stretching for miles through the streets of Tokyo, started from the Imperial Palace Plaza, passed through Ginza, Tokyo's most bustling area, and went to the Prime Minister's residence and the Diet Building. Hundreds of red flags fluttered in the demonstration procession on Ginza Street, and thousands of people sang "The Red Flag Song" and "The Internationale" in unison. Japanese police and cavalry, as well as American military police, were deployed along the route, but the demonstration procession ignored them. Upon arriving at the Prime Minister's residence they demanded that Yoshida appear. Yoshida avoided them and only sent his secretary to accept the workers' protest letter. At the mass rally before the demonstration, Kato, a leader of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, and Okano Susumu, a leader of the Japanese Communist Party, both gave speeches. The written speech of Kikunami, chairman of the Industrial Union Federation, who was injured in an assassination attempt, was also read at the meeting. Kato was elected chairman of the meeting. Most of the speakers at the meeting not only called for the overthrow of the Yoshida Cabinet, but also opposed the so-called "Three-Party Coalition Cabinet" of the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the right wing of the Social Democratic Party.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow, 28th broadcast: The Japanese Communist Party has decided to formally announce its participation in the work of the All-Japan Trade Union Strike Committee. The Japanese Communist Party has proposed to the Socialist Party to jointly participate in the work of this committee.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Tokyo: While the cabinet overthrow movement and the general strike plan are progressing, rumors of forming a three-party coalition government are circulating in Tokyo. This time, the one coming forward to organize it is Kijuro Shidehara, the leader of the Progressive Party, not Yoshida, the leader of the Liberal Party, who previously planned it. Yoshida had tried to rope in the right wing of the Socialist Party into the cabinet in mid-February, but then suddenly stopped the cabinet formation negotiations due to MacArthur's support. Recently, Shidehara held a special press conference, praising Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the Socialist Party, as Japan's "MacDonald" (who was once the leader of the British Labour Party and then betrayed his party to collude with the Conservative and Liberal parties). Although the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party still intend to join the cabinet, they fear that doing so will make them the target of the cabinet overthrow movement and general strike, along with the Liberal and Progressive ruling parties.

　　东京开始倒阁大示威
    五万日人游行高呼打倒吉田日警美兵戒备群众视若无睹
    【新华社延安二十九日电】东京讯：筹备已久之倒阁大示威，已于二十八日晨发动，政府及公共机关工人联合会之工人达五万人，在皇宫广场举行“打倒吉田内阁”群众大会，并于会后游行。东京市街长达数英里之示威队伍，自皇宫广场出发，经东京最热闹之银座以至首相官邸及议会会堂，银座街上飘扬着示威行列的数百面红旗，数千人齐声高歌“红旗之歌”及“国际歌”。日本警察及骑兵、美国宪兵均出动沿途警戒，但示威行列对之视若无睹，一直至首相官邸，要求吉田出见，吉田躲避不出，仅由其秘书接受工人代表之抗议书。在示威游行之前的群众大会上，社会民主党左派领袖加藤及日共领袖冈野进均发表演说，被刺受伤之产业工会联合会主席菊波之书面演辞，亦在会上宣读。加藤当选为大会主席，会上演说者大部分不仅要打倒吉田内阁，而且反对自由党、进步党以及社会民主党右派之所谓“三党联合内阁”。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科二十八日广播：日本共产党决议正式宣布参加全日本职工会罢工委员会的工作，日共已向社会党提议共同参加这一委员会的工作。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】东京讯：与倒阁运动及总罢工计划着进展之同时，东京又流传组织三党联合政府。此次出面活动的是进步党党魁币原，而非前次居中策划之自由党党魁吉田。吉田曾于本月中旬拉拢社会党右派入阁，其后因得麦克阿瑟的支持，又突然中止组阁谈判。最近币原曾举行特别记者招待会，大捧社会党主席片山哲誉为日本的“麦克唐纳”（曾为英国工党领袖后变节与保守党自由党同流合污）。社会党右派领袖虽然仍图入阁，但又恐这样一来曾与自由进步两执政党同为倒阁运动与总罢工之对象。
