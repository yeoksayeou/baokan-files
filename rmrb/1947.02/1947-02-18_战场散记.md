　　Battlefield Jottings
　　Du Bingru, Jin Qingtang
　　No Notice Given
　　Su Minwu, the nurse team leader of the Kuomintang's 343rd Regiment, was captured at the tail end of the enemy's retreat. I asked him, "Why were you running at the very end?" He said, "You wounded several hundred of our men last night. I was changing bandages when I heard a commotion outside. When I went out to look, I realized all three regiments had run away. I dropped my rope and jumped off the fortress wall to escape, but everywhere I looked, there were your men. In the end, none of the three regiments escaped." He then complained, "When you run, you should give advance notice."
　　Officer, Spare My Life
　　During the encirclement and annihilation of Liu Ruzhen, General Wang of a certain unit of our Weihe forces, riding his warhorse, led his troops to charge. Niu Zhanshan, a mortar squad leader of the Kuomintang army, pitifully knelt before General Wang and said, "Officer, spare my life!" General Wang helped him up and comforted him, "It's alright, your life is absolutely guaranteed. Lay down your weapons, and you will be our good friend."
　　I'm Carrying Seven Chiang Kai-sheks on My Back
　　Our soldier Jin Huaichen had just recovered from his wounds. When he heard the enemy was running, he charged empty-handed. He snatched grenades from the enemy on the battlefield and used them to attack. In the end, he captured seven brand-new "Zhongzheng-style" rifles. He asked me, "Isn't Zhongzheng Chiang Zhongzheng?" I said, "Yes." "Oh, my, I'm carrying seven Chiang Kai-sheks on my back!" he said excitedly. "Seven is nothing! They're piled up everywhere," a soldier next to him said with a laugh.
　　Have a Good New Year
　　We were staying in Zhang Village, and the villagers told me, "You fought so decisively. We won't be sending grain to those bastards (referring to the Kuomintang) anymore. This fight means all the poor people in our village will have meat to eat. With the help of our Eighth Route Army comrades, people from our village dragged back three big dead horses from the south (referring to the battlefield). The Eighth Route Army's marksmanship is so accurate, they shot the horses dead while they were running!" "It wasn't just the horses, the officers on the horses died too! I saw it from the wall," a thirteen-year-old child said, jumping up and down.
　　Changing Clothes
　　Niu Bao, who had been liberated, went to the street, and a child pointed at him and sang, "Chinese, American-made, wearing American clothes, wearing an American hat." Niu Bao heard this, blushed, and went back. He immediately went to see the company commander and said, "Give me some new clothes. Get rid of the traitor's skin, put on the Eighth Route Army uniform, and go down to the platoon to serve the people."

　　战场散记
    杜炳如、晋庆堂
    事先没通知
    蒋军三四三团看护队长苏民武，是在敌人退却的末尾捉来的。我问他：“你怎么跑在最后呢？”他说：“你们昨夜打伤我们几百人，我正在换药，听着门外乱跑，我出去一看，才知道三个团都跑光了，我丢下绳带从寨墙上跳下来就跑，谁知道四下都成了你们人，结果三个团一个也没跑掉。”最后他埋怨的说：“跑的时候，事先也不通知。”
    官长饶命
    在围歼刘汝珍时，我卫河某部王将军骑着战马率兵冲去，蒋军一个迫击炮班长牛占山，可怜的跪在王将军的面前说：“官长饶命吧！”王将军把他扶起来安慰道：“没关系，绝对保证你生命安全，放下武器，你就是我们的好朋友。”
    我背着七个蒋介石
    我战士靳怀臣负伤刚愈，这次他听到敌人跑了，空手冲上去，在战场上夺过敌人手榴弹就打敌人，最后他缴了七枝“中正式”的新枪，他问我：“中正不是蒋中正吗？”“我说是。”“啊呀，这会我背着七个蒋介石！”他兴奋地说。你七个算啥？到处堆的都是。”旁边一个战士笑着说。
    过个好年
    我们住在张庄，老百姓给我说：“你们打的真干脆，以后可不给他王八旦们（指国民党）送粮了，这一打俺全村穷人都有肉吃了，俺村的人在咱们八路同志帮助下，从南地（指打仗地方）拖来了三个大死马，八路枪法真准，马跑着就打死啦！”“不是光马，马上的官也死啦！我在墙头上看见的。”一个十三岁的小孩跳着说。
    换衣服
    解放过来的牛宝到街上，一个小孩子指着他唱：“中国人，美国造，穿着美国衣，戴着美国帽”。牛宝听了，脸一红回去了，马上去见连长说：“你给我换衣服吧，去了汉奸皮，穿上八路衣，下到班里，去为老百姓出出力。”
