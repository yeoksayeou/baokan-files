    Rescuing Civilian Homes
    One morning, our troops were firmly defending the Jinxiang North Gate position when enemy artillery fiercely bombarded us. Suddenly, a shell landed on a civilian house, immediately setting it ablaze. Comrade Niu Genfa, 18 years old, immediately climbed onto the roof to put out the fire. Two enemy machine guns in the city started firing at him, but he was not afraid at all. Comrades on the ground told him to be careful, and he replied, "It doesn't matter, it's an honor to die for the people." He persisted until he extinguished the fire.

    Repairing Dilapidated Houses
    East of the location of the Fifth Squad of the 104th Unit, there was an old woman in her eighties living in a dilapidated house. Half of the south wall had collapsed and hadn't been repaired, and it seemed the whole house would collapse soon. The comrades of the Fifth Squad of the unit voluntarily repaired it for her. The old woman was so moved that her eyes were filled with tears, and she didn't know what to say.

    Presenting a Show
    When the Eighth Company of the 83rd Unit was stationed in Zhu Temple, although the weather was very cold, none of the comrades picked up dry branches from the trees to make a fire. When borrowing things from the people, they respected local customs and manners, asking for permission before entering. They also carried water for the masses every day. The masses all said, "The Eighth Company are true Eighth Route Army soldiers, just as good as the Political Department that lived here before." One day, the village chief came to the Eighth Company headquarters and said to the company commander, "The people in the village want to put on a show for you." "No need, it's too wasteful," the company commander quickly said. "The show is their own, it won't cost money. They said if you don't agree, they'll all come to see you." The village chief forced the company commander to agree, and the company commander had no choice but to agree.

    The villagers of Zhu Temple were very concerned about the comrades of the Eighth Company. After He Chengzhi of the Fourth Squad of the Eighth Company fell ill, the landlord insisted that he go to the main room to sweat it out. Comrade He was embarrassed to go, but the landlord said, "If you don't go, then we're not family!" When the Seventh Squad moved houses, the landlord refused to let them move, no matter what.

    Borrowing Certificates
    The Third Detachment of the 2526th Unit created borrowing certificates in carrying out the Support the Army and Cherish the People campaign, and stipulated three conventions: First, publicize to village cadres and the masses that no items will be lent without a borrowing certificate; Second, anyone found borrowing things without a borrowing certificate will be considered a violation of discipline; Third, if an individual damages something, the individual will compensate; if the squad damages something, the whole squad will compensate. Since the creation of this method, damage to the people's belongings has been greatly reduced compared to the past.

    Discipline Inspection
    The 104th Unit, in the gaps between battles, organized a discipline inspection team, divided into three groups. On January 21st, they had already departed separately to the stationed areas of subordinate units and the villages they had previously been stationed in, to conduct mass discipline inspections and convene army-civilian unity meetings, to further strengthen army-civilian relations. The masses warmly welcomed the team wherever it went.

    Not Borrowing Civilian Clothes
    Comrade Yue Qingyun of the Seventh Detachment was liberated from the Shangguan battle. On the night of the 31st, when the North Gate of Jinxiang was captured, he waded through the water because the bridge was narrow and crowded, and pounced on the city gate, attacking the enemy with grenades. At dawn, when the troops withdrew to the North Gate, his clothes were soaked and he was frozen purple. Other comrades put a single layer of clothing on him, but it didn't help. Many comrades advised him to borrow a piece of clothing from a villager, but he said excitedly, "That belongs to the people, we must observe discipline!" He remained frozen for a whole day, and the comrades were deeply moved by him.

    抢救民房
    一日上午，我军坚守金乡北关阵地，敌人的炮火向我猛烈轰击，忽然一颗炮弹落在一座民房上，立刻燃烧起来，十八岁的牛根法同志，随即爬上房顶救火，城里敌人的两挺机枪对准他叫起来了，但他一点也不怕，地下的同志招呼他小心，他回答说：“不要紧，为老百姓死了也光荣。”他一直坚持着把火扑灭。
    修理破屋
    在一○四部队五班驻地的东边，有一个八十多岁的老太太，住着一间破陋不堪的房子，南山墙塌了半边，也没有修理，说不定那时房子整个会倒下来的。该部五班同志自动给她修好了，感动的老太太眼里含着泪珠，不知说什么好。
    送一台戏
    八三部队八连住朱庙时，天气虽很冷，八连没有一个同志去拾树上的干棒烤火，他们在向老百姓借东西的时候，遵重当地风俗人情，先打招呼才进去，又每天给群众担水，群众都说：“八连是老八路，和过去政治部住的一样好。”一天村长到八连部对连长说。“村里的人要给你们送一台戏哩。”“可不要，太浪费了，”连长抢着说：“戏是自己的，不用花钱，他们说你不答应，他们都来见你。”村长逼着连长答应，连长只好答应了。
    朱庙的老乡对八连同志们十分关心，八连四班何成志病了后，房东一定要他到上房里发汗，何同志不好意思去，房东说：“你要不去，那就不是一家人啦！”七班搬房子时，房东说啥也不叫搬。
    借物证
    二五二六部队三分队在开展拥爱运动中，创造借物证，并规定了三条公约：第一、向村干及群众宣传，没有借物证不借给东西；第二、大家发现借东西不用借物证以破坏纪律论；第三、个人弄坏了东西，个人赔，班里弄坏了，全班赔。自从创造这一办法后，弄坏老百姓东西比过去大为减少。
    检查纪律
    一○四部队，在战争空隙中，组织了纪律检查队，划分了三个小组，一月二十一日已分头出发，到所属部队驻地及已往驻过的村庄，进行群众纪律检查，并召开军民团结大会，使军民关系更进一步密切起来。该队所到之处，群众热烈欢迎。
  不借民衣
    七分队岳清云同志，是上官战斗解放过来的，三十一日夜攻下金乡北门时，因桥窄人挤，他便涉水过去，扑到城门下，用手榴弹打击敌人，天明时，部队撤回了北关，他全身衣服湿透，身上冻得发紫。别的同志给他套上单衣，可是不顶事，许多同志劝他，老乡家里借件衣服穿，他很激昂的说：“那是老百姓的，咱要守纪律呀！”他一直冻了一天，同志们都被他深深的感动了。
