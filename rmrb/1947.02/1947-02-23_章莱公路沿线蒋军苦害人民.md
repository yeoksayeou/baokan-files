Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st: More than sixty villages around Kouzhen along the Zhang (Qiu) Lai (Wu) Highway, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army's 12th Corps, had all their trees, tombs, and steles cut down, leveled, and destroyed. The wood and furniture were used for construction purposes, and wooden furniture, plows, rakes, spinning wheels, and weaving machines were all broken up and used as fuel. The flour and pork that the masses had prepared for the Spring Festival were also looted. According to a district statistic in Kouzhen, more than 400 young men were conscripted, and most of the women who did not escape were raped, even relatives of the "Homecoming Corps" were not spared. Zheng Zhuanghan, a landlord in Xiaoqin Village, relying on his son-in-law's position in the "Homecoming Corps," did not send his daughter and daughter-in-law away, and both were raped. Currently, the district democratic government has launched a "Bowl of Grain Movement" to help the disaster-stricken compatriots in several towns.

　　章莱公路沿线蒋军苦害人民
    【新华社山东二十一日电】沿章（邱）莱（芜）公路上口镇周围蒋军十二军侵占之六十余庄，所有树木坟墓碑石等悉被砍伐、掘平、打毁。木料、家具作为构筑工事之用，木制家具及犁耙纺车布机等均被折毁当作燃料。群众留备春节食用的面粉、猪肉，亦均被抢光。据口镇一个区统计，被抓壮丁四百余名，妇女未逃走者多被奸淫，即令“还乡团”亲友亦难幸免。小芹村地主郑庄汉自恃女婿在“还乡团”任职未将女儿与儿媳送走，均遭奸污，现该区民主政府发起“一碗粮运动”，救济几镇等处受灾同胞。
