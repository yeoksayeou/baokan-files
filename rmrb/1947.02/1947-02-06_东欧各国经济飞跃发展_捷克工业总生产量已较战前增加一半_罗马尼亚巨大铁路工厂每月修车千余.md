Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. A comprehensive report on the economic dynamics of Eastern European countries. Czechoslovakia's total industrial production has increased by half in the eighteen months since liberation. Current production is equal to 70 percent of the 1937 level. Trains, locomotives, cement, and textiles have greatly increased. The production of trucks and motorcycles has reached pre-war peak levels. Steel and electricity production has reached pre-war levels, and coal production has exceeded them. UNRRA Director LaGuardia said, "Between the Labe River and the Soviet border, no one has achieved greater recovery than Czechoslovakia."

The Yugoslav Ministry of Industry released a summary of last year's production, pointing out that the textile industry increased by 176 percent, the leather industry increased by 170 percent, and the electrical industry increased by 203 percent.

The Bulgarian Supreme Economic Council has approved a two-year economic plan. The main goal of this plan is to overcome the economic difficulties caused by fascist rule and war, to reach and exceed pre-war production levels, and to improve the living conditions of the people.

The largest railway factory in Europe, located in Dimitrovgrad, Romania, will replace the old, destroyed railway factory. Nine large factories, each 200 meters long, have now been completed and can repair 1,500 cars and 500 engines per month.

Last year, Finland imported 558.7 million rubles worth of goods from the Soviet Union, mainly grain and machinery. The Soviet Union imported 402.5 million Finnish marks worth of goods from Finland, mainly timber and paper.
