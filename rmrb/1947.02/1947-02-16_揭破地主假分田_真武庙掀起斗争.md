　　Exposing Landlords' Sham Land Distribution
    Zhenwu Temple Unveils Struggle
    [Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 14th] Zhenwu Temple in the Second District of Yanggu was under enemy rule for a long time. After liberation, it underwent democratic and livelihood struggles, but the masses were never mobilized or organized. Before the new year, land reform was carried out. When cadres arrived in the village, they first investigated why the masses had not acted in the past. After investigation, it was found that the landlords of this village had taken out their own land and distributed it to poor peasants to avoid struggle. The poor peasants believed that it had become their own land, so they no longer acted. During the land reform before the new year, when the Chiang army entered Fan County and Guancheng, the landlords revealed their true colors and forced the land back. The leadership proved this fact and educated the masses, making them realize that without struggling against the landlords, they could not truly achieve emancipation. The masses also awakened and acted, established peasant associations, and produced peasant leaders, and then struggled against the landlords.

　　揭破地主假分田
    真武庙掀起斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】阳谷二区真武庙，曾经敌长时期统治，解放后，曾经过民主民生斗争，但群众一直未发动起来，也无组织。年前进行土地改革，干部到村首先研究为啥过去群众不动？经调查后，发现这庄的地主，过去把自己的地拿出来，分给贫农种，以躲避斗争，贫农则认为成了自己的地，所以也不再动。在年前正进行土地改革时，蒋军进到范县、观城，地主露了真面目，又把地逼要回去。领导上就证明这事实，教育群众，使群众认识到不向地主作斗争，就不能真正得到翻身，群众也觉悟动起来了，建立了农会，产生了农民的领袖，就向地主斗起来。
