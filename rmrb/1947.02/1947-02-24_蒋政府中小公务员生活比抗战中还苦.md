Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to the Nanjing Central Daily News on January 20th, a detailed statistical report by the Central News Agency shows that the life of lower and middle-level civil servants in the Chiang government is even more difficult than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In December of last year, prices in Nanjing had risen 10,075 times compared to 1937. Although the salaries of "central"-level civil servants in the Chiang government were adjusted five times last year, they still lagged far behind prices. The December adjustment included a living allowance of 170,000 yuan and a 1,100-fold increase in base salary. A civil servant with a base salary of 100 yuan before the war could now receive more than 280,000 yuan, but their actual income was only equivalent to 27.9 yuan before the war, just slightly more than a quarter of their pre-war income. Even the Central News Agency reporters had to point out: "With this meager income, it is impossible to even have enough to eat, let alone maintain integrity and administrative efficiency." "All the government's policies to stabilize prices have failed." It also stated that last year's five salary adjustments were only "relief given when prices were too high and the lives of public and educational personnel were on the verge of collapse, in order to extend their lives."

　　蒋政府中小公务员生活比抗战中还苦
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据上月二十日南京中央日报载：中央社详细统计说明，蒋政府中下层公务员生活，较抗战时期更形痛苦。去年十二月份，南京物价较一九三七年涨了一万零七十五倍。蒋政府“中央”一级公务人员，待遇去年虽经五度调整，但始终远远落在物价后面。十二月份的调整，是生活补助费十七万元，底薪增加一千一百倍。战前底薪百元的公务员，这时候可以拿到二十八万余元，但其实际收入，只等于战前的二十七元九角，仅当战前收入四分之一稍强。甚至中央社记者亦不得不指出：“以此微薄之收入，温饱已不可能，更何谈养廉及行政效率。”“政府各种稳定物价之政策，一切均告失败。”并称：去年的五度调整待遇，仅为“物价过高，公教人员生活濒于绝境时，始不得不予以救济，以延长其生命。”
