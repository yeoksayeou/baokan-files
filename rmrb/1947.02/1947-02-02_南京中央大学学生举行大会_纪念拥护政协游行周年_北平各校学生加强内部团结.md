Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Nanjing Report: On the 25th, Central University in Nanjing held an anniversary commemoration of the "January 25th" mass parade (Note: The school held a parade and demonstration in support of the Political Consultative Conference on the same day last year). More than 3,000 students attended, and representatives from various political parties were invited to give speeches. Many professors from Central University also attended the meeting. First, the chairman of the student union gave a speech, stating briefly: The success of the Political Consultative Conference was the hope of the people of the whole country; unfortunately, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were not implemented. The "January 25th" parade was a landmark shift for Central University from conservatism to democracy, and it will now serve as the vanguard of the national student democratic movement. After the chairman's speech, a congratulatory letter from the Liaison Office of the Communist Party of China stationed in Nanjing to the association was read aloud. Li Xiangfu, the representative of the China Democratic League, gave a speech, emphasizing that since the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were not implemented, the people would never recognize the one-party "National Assembly" and the pseudo-constitution. The destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions was the result of the Kuomintang's warmongers' unwillingness to abandon dictatorship, unilateral U.S. aid, and the collusion of small parties. Li said: Democracy will surely win, and he hoped that everyone would rise up and fight for it! Li's words received enthusiastic applause from the audience. Chen Qitian of the Youth Party was booed off the stage when he spoke. When Chen said that "the National Assembly constitution has realized a part of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions," condemnations arose from all around, and Chen had to step down in embarrassment. That morning, Central University students also posted slogans throughout Nanjing: "Oppose civil war!" "Oppose the Sino-US Commercial Treaty!" "Strive for the realization of the Political Consultative Conference!" "Down with bureaucratic capitalism!" "Parties withdraw from schools!" The slogans were also posted high at the gate of the National Government and the "National Assembly" meeting place. A small number of party members at Central University tried to obstruct the commemoration, but ultimately failed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: According to a Beiping dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 15th: After the parade and demonstration by students in Beiping to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military, students from various schools are carrying out internal solidarity organization work. Since the start of the semester at Peking University, there has been no student union. After this movement, students felt the necessity of organization. The medical school and the preparatory class of the university have established student unions respectively. The Faculty of Arts is also actively preparing to establish a faculty association and has already begun to elect representatives. The faculty association of the Faculty of Science is also preparing to be established. The report also stated that the Peking University "Anti-Violence Association" protested the incident on the 29th of last month when more than 200 special agent "students" went to Peking University to make trouble, and has requested the school authorities in writing to resolve the matter reasonably. The school authorities were forced to state that "if it is found that the instigator is a student of this school, they will be expelled immediately. As for the outside thugs, the security authorities will be asked to investigate." Peking University students are currently awaiting concrete results.

　　南京中央大学学生举行大会
    纪念拥护政协游行周年
    北平各校学生加强内部团结
    【新华社延安三十日电】南京讯：廿五日京市中央大学举行“一、二五”大游行周年纪念（按：该校曾于去年同日举行拥护政协游行示威），到同学三千余人，并邀各党派代表出席演讲，中大教授多人亦出席会议。首由学生自治会主席致词，略称：政协成功为全国人民的希望；不幸政协决议竟未实行。“一·二五”游行为中大从保守走向民主的划时期的转变，今后党为全国学生民主运动先锋。”主席致词毕，次即朗读驻京中共联络处致该会之贺函；民盟代表李相符致词，强调政协决议未实行，人民决不承认一党“国大”及伪宪；政协决议被毁破，为国民党好战派不愿放弃独裁、美国片面援助及小党派帮凶之结果。李氏谓：民主一定胜利，希望大家起来争取！李氏的话博得全场热烈鼓掌。青年党陈启天之演讲，则遭全场一致唾弃。当陈讲至“国大宪法已将政协决议实现一部分”时。斥责四起，陈不得已狼狈下台。该日清晨，中大学生并在南京全市张贴标语：“反对内战！”“反对中美商约！”“争取政协实现！”“打倒官僚资本！”“党派退出学校！”等。标语并高贴国府及“国大”会场门口。中大少数党团分子曾对此纪念力加阻挠，但终告失败。
    【新华社延安三十日电】据天津大公报十五日北平消息：平市各大学抗议美军暴行游行示威后，各校学生均进行内部团结组织工作。北大开学以来，迄无学生自治会；经过此次运动，同学均感有组织之必要，刻该校医学院与先修班已分别成立自治会；文学院亦积极筹备成立院会，并已进行选举代表；理学院院会亦将筹备成立。又该报载称：北大“抗暴会”都抗议上月二十九日二百余特务“学生”到北大捣乱事件，已书面请求学校当局合理解决，学校当局被迫表示“启事人如查明有本校学生，当即开除。校外暴徒，当函请治安当局追究。”北大同学刻正等候具体结果。
