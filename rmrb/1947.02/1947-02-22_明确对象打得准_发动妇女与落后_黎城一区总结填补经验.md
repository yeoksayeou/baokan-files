　　Clearly Define Targets for Accurate Strikes
    Mobilize Women and the Backward
    Licheng First District Summarizes and Fills Gaps in Experience
    [Our Newspaper reported] After a widespread struggle against feudal landlords in Licheng First District, 9,723 mu of land, 3,790 rooms of houses and kilns, as well as livestock and grain, have been seized. The work of leveling and replenishing has been initially completed. Recently, a district-wide cadre meeting was held to summarize the following experiences: (1) The targets of liquidation were clearly defined, resulting in accurate strikes. For example, in Beifang Village, under the slogan "Uproot trees, uproot the big roots; Strike, strike accurately," a second wave of liquidation movement against landlords was launched. (2) Using the suffering of the bitter to lead the bitter, go door-to-door to ignite those who are silent and women. Gui Tian from Nanjie was the most silent peasant. After being mobilized by the cadres, he not only mobilized his entire family of three, but also mobilized six honest peasants. Using this method, one hundred and forty basic peasant households were turned into active members of the land reform movement. Zhang Dacui, the secretary of the Women's Federation in Dongguan, organized one hundred and twenty women to engage in liquidation struggles against landlords, demonstrating the power of women in the movement. Li Enping, the secretary of the Women's Rescue Association in Xiwu, reported two guns belonging to the major special agent Liu Guanghan during her grievance telling. The concubine of the landlord Wang Zhaoduan in Xiazhuang proposed a divorce from Wang Zhaoduan after becoming enlightened. (3) Integrate land reform with production. In villages where the elimination of feudal exploitation was relatively thorough, it was proposed to combine land reform with production, achieving land reform without hindering production. Based on the above experiences, the district meeting determined the future tasks: continue to implement ideological mobilization, launch the land investigation movement, not allowing landlords to leave "air-raid shelters," and achieve the complete elimination of feudalism.

　　明确对象打得准
    发动妇女与落后
    黎城一区总结填补经验
    【本报讯】黎城一区经过对封建地主的普遍斗争，清算出土地九千七百二十三亩，房窑三千七百九十间及牲口、粮食等，现已初步完成填平补齐，近特召开全区干部会总结经验如下：（一）、明确了清算对象打的准，如北坊村在“刨树要刨大根，打要打准”的口号下，展开二次对地主连发的清算运动。（二）以苦引苦挨门点火发动不吭气的人与妇女。南街桂田是最不吭气的农民，经干部发动后，他不但把自己全家三口人发动起来，还发动了六个老实农民。用这办法将一百四十户基本农民变成翻身运动中的积极分子。东关妇女会秘书张大翠组织了一百二十个妇女与地主进行清算斗争，表现了妇女在运动中的力量。西仵妇救会秘书李恩平，在诉苦中将大特务刘光汉的两支枪报出来。霞庄地主王兆端的小老婆在觉悟后提出与王兆端离婚。（三）翻身与生产结合进行。在消灭封建剥削较彻底的村，提出翻身与生产结合，做到了翻身不误生产。该区会议根据以上经验确定今后任务：继续贯彻思想发动，展开查田运动，不让地主留下“防空洞”，达到彻底消灭封建。
