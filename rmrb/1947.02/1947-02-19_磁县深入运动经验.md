　　Magnetic County Deepening Movement Experience
　　Chen Ting
　　The mass movement in Magnetic County entered a deepening phase at the beginning of January. After half a month of effort, according to the county-wide expanded cadre meeting on January 27, most of the county, except for a few villages close to the enemy, had been mobilized (226 out of 373 villages). The following experiences were gained during the movement:

　　Checking Land and Class Status is the Focus of the Deepening Movement
　　1. Checking land and class status should be the main content of the deepening movement, and we should seriously check whether the landless poor have been eliminated, whether the poor peasants have risen in status, and whether the landlords have been eliminated. In Yangjiao Township and other villages in the Eighth District, it was found that landlords falsely divided their families, changing themselves into middle peasants (some families were divided into eight households) to deceive the masses, and transferred their property to mountain gullies. In other cases, after the major movement, the quality of the land left to the landlords to maintain their livelihoods was too good, and there was still a large gap compared with the landless poor and poor peasants. In Pengcheng, it was discovered that the feudal kiln owner Niu Kuanzhou had secret kiln caves, where he concealed a large amount of property, handguns, etc. We must start with specific problems and overcome the "almost" and "no profit" mentality in order to discover problems. We should not only pay attention to eliminating the landlord class economically, but also see whether the landlords have bowed their heads politically. For example, Pengcheng deepened the movement under the slogan of "digging out the brains, overturning the thoughts, pursuing the organization, and thoroughly fighting politically."

　　2. Open up the minds of cadres and resolve the estrangement between cadres and the masses. In the Sixth District, it was generally found that village cadres were shielding landlords. The leadership proposed to launch a "heart-to-heart talk" movement among the cadres, which aroused the inner ideological struggle of the cadres. The political director of Donghuayuan Village confessed that when he struggled against the landlord, his wife scolded him and his mother ignored him, and the landlord said: "Being a cadre will not end well. Even if you are not a cadre, you will still have something to eat." As a result, he softened and shielded the landlord. Other cadres also confessed that they had shielded the landlord's property, etc. Because of the transformation of the cadres, the masses became more motivated and continued to thoroughly fight the landlords. During the famine in Beijiabi Village, cadres borrowed grain from landlords. During this inspection, it was found that it was almost a case of "each protecting a landlord" (each shielding a landlord). In the "heart-to-heart talk" movement, they reflected on and examined the mistake of shielding landlords under the pretext of taking care of their lives. Only 18 households were found to have hidden four rifles, 55 mu of land, and a lot of houses and grain for the landlords. In Liangdou Village, hooligans were in power and embezzled, and suppressed the masses. After the leadership discovered the problem, they went deep into the masses to brew and collude, and the masses rose up to impeach the bad cadres and launched a struggle. In Pengcheng Hequan Village, cadres and the masses held a reunion meeting, untied the knots, and the cadres withdrew the extra fruit they had divided, and then deepened the struggle. Generally speaking, except for a few villages where bad cadres must be replaced, it can generally be said that cadres can be persuaded to dare to admit their mistakes in front of the masses and withdraw the extra fruit they have gained, and the masses can be persuaded to forgive and cherish the history of the cadres, seek unity between the two sides, and then launch a struggle against the landlords.

　　Combining Combat Readiness and Struggle Transforms the Mood of the Masses
　　3. How to combine combat readiness with the deepening movement? In the two major combat readiness campaigns, at first, it was just simple and passive combat readiness. The masses' thinking of changing the world was very strong, and they showed panic. The cadres believed that combat readiness would prevent the mass movement from proceeding. Timid peasants and village cadres returned things to the landlords and spoke good words, and the landlords also took the opportunity to threaten the masses, affecting the continuation of the movement. Later, it was transformed into carrying out combat readiness through mobilizing the masses to struggle, exposing the landlords' sham struggle and offensive conspiracies, and finding out the weapons hidden by the landlords. In the border areas, militia were organized to guard and take the initiative to attack, which changed the situation with such an active and proactive struggle. For example, the militia of Zhang Village in the Fourth District (five li away from the enemy) took the initiative to attack, determined to go to the south bank of Henan to see what the enemy looked like. Then they went three times in ten days, distributed leaflets, and burned a blockhouse, greatly increasing the confidence of the masses in the struggle and resolutely fighting the landlords. The First District also used the same method to take the initiative to attack the enemy in Linzhang. The first time they captured five special agents, which promoted the development of the mass movement in the entire district. In the Third District, Jiangwucheng Village discovered during combat readiness that the masses were not actively transferring. After checking the reasons, they found that the landlords controlled the village administration and pretended to struggle against the landlords but actually struggled against the middle peasants. The district cadres then held a middle peasant meeting to explain, and the middle peasants became active and reported that many households had stored guns for the landlords. Then, it was discovered that 50% of the households in the village were storing things for the landlords, and a struggle against the landlords was launched, while completing combat readiness.

　　4. The problem of mobilizing backward villages: The backward villages discovered in this deepening movement have the following characteristics: First, landlords and special agents secretly hijacked the peasant association's political power, using their confidants to pretend to be active and deceive the leadership into giving them leading positions. Second, they pretended to struggle against the landlords but actually struggled against the middle peasants, and many middle peasants suffered losses. For example, in Quantou Village, they called for land contributions. The landlords pretended to contribute, but the middle peasants really contributed. In the Zhao Yuanzhuang peasant association, one group of 15 people struggled against 11 (all middle peasants). Third, the masses were particularly afraid of feudal landlords and dared not rise up to struggle, and did not trust the leadership. Based on this situation, the leadership generally used the following methods to open up the situation: (1) Bypassing the cadres and directly going deep into the poor and bitter masses to inspire them to speak out their grievances and discover activists to let them collude themselves. (2) Supporting the new activists. (3) Comparing strengths to make the masses realize whether their strength is greater or the landlords' strength is greater. (4) Believing in the activists and letting them go ahead and do it. (5) Explaining to the middle peasants and mobilizing the middle and poor peasants to speak out their grievances together and absorb them into the struggle.

　　磁县深入运动经验
    陈挺
    磁县群运从元月初进入深入阶段，经过半月努力，据一月二十七日全县扩干会检查，全县除少数近敌村庄外，大部分都已动起来（三百七十三村中动了二百二十六个村）。运动中获得以下经验：
  查田查阶级是深入运动重点
    一、查田查阶级应为深入运动主要内容，认真检查赤贫是否消灭？贫农是否上升？地主是否消灭等问题。在八区羊角铺等村发现地主假分家改变为中农（有的一户分为八户）来欺骗群众，并将资财转运山沟中。还有的是大动过后，留给地主维持生活的土地质量过好，与赤贫贫农比较尚有很大悬殊。在彭城发现封建窑主牛宽周有暗窑洞，隐存大量财物、手枪等。要从具体问题检查入手，克服“差不多”“没油水”思想，才能发现问题。不仅要注意经济上使地主阶级消灭，而且要看地主政治上是否低头。如彭城是在“脑子挖透、思想倒透、组织追透、政治上斗透”的四透口号下，深入了运动。
    二、打通干部思想、解决干部与群众隔阂。六区普遍发现村干部包庇地主，领导上在干部中提出开展“良心话”运动，引起了干部的内心思想斗争，东花园村的政治主任，讲出了自己斗地主时，老婆骂、母亲不理，地主说：“当干部没下场，你不当干部也有你吃的。”这样自己软化了，对地主包庇。其他干部亦均检讨出自己包庇地主的东西财物等。由于干部的转变，群众的劲头就又大起来，继续把地主斗透。北贾壁村干部灾荒时借过地主粮，此次检查中，发现几乎是“各保一主”（各包庇一地主）。在说“良心话”运动中，反省检讨了借口照顾地主生活而包庇地主的错误，仅十八户即查出为地主埋藏的步枪四枝、土地五十五亩，及房子粮食等甚多。粮斗庄流氓当道贪污，并压抑群众，领导上发现问题后，即深入群众中去，酝酿串通，群众起来罢免了坏干部，开展了斗争。彭城河泉村，干部与群众开团圆会，解开圪塔，干部退出多分果实，而后深入开展斗争。总起来讲，除过少数村的坏干部必须撤换外，一般的可说通干部敢于在群众面前承认错误退出多得果实，说通群众原谅与宝贵干部历史，求得双方团结，而后开展对地主的斗争。
  斗争中备战转变了群众情绪
    三、备战怎样与深入运动结合？在两次大备战中，起初只是单纯消极备战，群众变天思想很厉害，表现恐慌，干部认为备战就不能进行群运，胆小的农民和村干给地主退东西，说好话，地主也趁机威胁群众，影响运动的继续进行。后来转变为从发动群众斗争中进行备战，揭穿地主假斗争和进攻阴谋，查出地主暗藏武器等。边沿区则组织民兵警戒，主动出击，这样积极主动的斗争，转变了局面。如四区漳村（距敌人五里）民兵主动出击，决心到河南岸看看敌人是啥样子，接着在十天中去三次，并散发传单，还烧了一个炮楼，群众斗争信心大增，坚决和地主进行了斗争。一区亦以同样办法，去临漳主动打敌人，第一次就捉回五个特务，推动了全区群众运动的开展。三区讲武城村，在备战中发现群众不积极转移，检查原因，发现该村地主把持村政，假斗地主实斗中农，区干部便开了中农会进行解释，中农积极起来，报出不少户为地主保存的枪支，接着就发现本村有百分之五十户为地主存东西，开展了对地主斗争，同时完成了备战。
    四、落后村的发动问题：此次深入运动中发现的落后村，有以下几个特点：第一是地主特务暗中劫持农会政权，以自己的心腹假装积极骗上领导地位。第二是假斗地主实斗中农，中农很多受了损失，如泉头村号召献地，地主假献，中农真献。赵援庄农会一个小组，十五人中斗了十一个（均中农）。第三是群众对封建地主特别害怕，不敢起来斗争，对领导上不相信。依据这种情况在领导上一般都运用了以下的方法打开局面：（一）撇开干部，直接深入贫苦群众中去启发诉苦，发现积极分子让他们自己去串通。（二）替新的积极分子撑腰。（三）对比力量，让群众认清自己力量大？还是地主力量大？（四）相信积极分子，放手让他们起来干。（五）对中农进行解释，发动中贫农共同诉苦，吸收他们参加斗争。
