　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Tokyo dispatch: Simultaneously with the breakdown of cabinet formation negotiations, the negotiations between representatives of government civil servants and public utility unions and the government also broke down at 9 pm on the 29th. When union representatives left the Prime Minister's residence at night, they sang "The Internationale." In view of the government authorities' continued stubborn refusal to meet workers' demands, the outbreak of a general strike by 2.7 million people is imminent. Many other unions and public utility unions have expressed sympathy and support. The All-Japan Federation of Newspaper and Radio Workers Associations decided on the afternoon of the 29th to participate in the general strike on February 1st. This union attempted to strike last October but failed to do so. According to union leaders, streetcar and bus workers in major Japanese cities may participate in the general strike on February 1st. If such sympathy strikes are realized, the number of strikers will increase to over 3 million. It is reported that American officials at MacArthur Headquarters are still threatening union leaders to cancel the strike. According to a United Press reporter, the atmosphere in Tokyo on the evening of the 29th was more tense than at any time in recent months.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Comprehensive Tokyo report: The second round of negotiations between the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the right-wing of the Socialist Party regarding the formation of a three-party coalition cabinet has again broken down. The Socialist Party officially announced its refusal to join the cabinet on the 29th. Prior to this, Tokyo had been rife with rumors for days that a three-party cabinet was about to be formed, with claims that right-wing Socialist Party leaders Tetsu Katayama, Komakichi Matsuoka, and Rikizo Hirano had been internally designated to serve as Ministers Without Portfolio, Minister of Labor, and Director of the Reconstruction Board, respectively. These right-wing Socialists originally intended to occupy five seats in the cabinet, and even after only securing three seats (with the position of Director of the Reconstruction Board being subordinate to that of a minister), they still intended to join the cabinet; however, the cabinet formation negotiations broke down again at the last moment on the night of the 28th. It is rumored that the reason was that Katayama and Yoshida had already reached a compromise to remove the current Minister of Finance, Ishibashi, and replace him with the president of the Bank of Japan, Zensuke Ando. However, the "elders" of Yoshida's Liberal Party, upon hearing of this matter, went to see Yoshida and insisted on Ishibashi remaining in his post. It is said that the majority of the party's supporters are "new zaibatsu" represented by Ishibashi. If Ishibashi were to be removed, these zaibatsu would immediately cease their financial support for the party. These zaibatsu had greatly profited during Ishibashi's tenure and were able to freely engage in black market activities. Ishibashi's fiscal policy had already caused widespread discontent. Therefore, although the right-wing Socialists were eager to join the cabinet, they were also unwilling to be responsible for Ishibashi's evil policies and insisted on his removal, leading to the final breakdown of the negotiations. The political atmosphere in Tokyo on the 29th and 30th was extremely tense and chaotic.

    东京空气紧张
    二百七十万人终将总罢工
    【新华社延安三十一日电】东京讯：与组阁谈判破裂同时，政府公务员与公用事业工会代表与政府间之谈判，于二十九日晚九时亦告破裂，工会代表于夜间离开首相官邸时，高唱《红旗之歌》。鉴于政府当局依然固执拒绝工人要求，二百七十万人之总罢工爆发有如箭在弦上。许多其他工会与公用事业工会表示同情与支持，全日报界与广播工人协会，已于二十九日午后决议参加二月一日总罢工，该工会曾于去年十月意图罢工而未实现。据工会领袖们表示，日本各大城市之电车与公共汽车工人可能参加二月一日之总罢工，如此等同情罢工一旦实现，则罢工人数将增至三百万以上。据悉麦克阿瑟总部美方官员仍威胁工人领袖取消罢工。据合众社记者称，二十九日晚，东京空气较数月来任何时候更为紧张。
    【新华社延安卅一日电】综合东京消息：自由党、进步党与社会党右派间关于组织三党联合入阁的第二次谈判又告破裂，社会党于二十九日正式声明拒绝入阁。前此东京连日盛传三党内阁即将组成，有谓社会党右派领袖片山哲、松冈驹吉及平野力三等三人已内定分别出任无仟所（按即不管部）大臣、劳工省大臣及复兴局三职，此等社会党右派原拟在内阁中占五席，其后虽仅获三席（且其中复兴局一席地位次于大臣）亦拟入阁；但是组阁谈判于二十八日夜最后一刻又告破裂。据传原因为片山与吉田原已妥协决定现任藏相石桥去职、由日本银行总裁前由代之，及吉田之自由党，“元老”闻悉此事后，即往见吉田，坚持石桥留任。据谓该党支持者大多数是以石桥为代表之“新财阀”，如石桥去职，则此等财阀即将停止对该党财政上之支持。此等财阀曾在石桥任内大事渔利，并得自由进行黑市活动石桥之财政政策已闹得怨声载道。故社会党右派虽渴望入阁，但亦不愿替石桥之恶政负责而力主其去职，因而谈判最后破裂。二十九、三十两日东京政治空气极为紧张与混乱。
