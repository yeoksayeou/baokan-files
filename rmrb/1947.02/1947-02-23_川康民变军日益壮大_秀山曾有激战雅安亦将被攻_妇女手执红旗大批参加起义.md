Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th. The uprising in Xikang continues to develop. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th, the "People's Self-Defense Army" uprising force of 5,000 people is assembled a few miles east of Ya'an, preparing to attack the city. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao and other sources: "Ninety percent of the people in Xikang are suffering to the point where they are not clothed and cannot eat their fill, which is the fundamental cause of the war in Xikang." Many women in Xikang also participated in the uprising forces. In the team that attacked Feixian Pass in Ya'an last month, a women's team led by Bao Sanniang appeared on the front line, preserving the red flag, and the team members all had red crosses nailed to their shoulders. At the same time, according to the Central News Agency: The Chiang government insists on a policy of massacre against the uprising. Zhang, the director of Chiang Kai-shek's Chongqing Provisional Headquarters, convened a planning meeting in Chengdu. When he arrived in Chongqing on the 17th, he said: "He has ordered the Sichuan and Kang pacification headquarters to be responsible for supervising the troops to suppress the uprising." At the same time, Liu Wenhui also returned to Kang from Rong on the 19th to execute the "suppression" order.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. Comprehensive reports from newspapers in Chongqing and Shanghai: Armed uprisings in Sichuan have been active recently. In Badong County, eastern Sichuan, there is a "very well-equipped" (Shanghai Wen Hui Bao) uprising team, about 1,500 people, which attacked the county seat on January 16. After a fierce battle with the garrison, they retreated into the mountains. The uprising force of more than 100 people led by Li Mingju in Longguan Mountain, Longchang, southern Sichuan, appeared on the Longchang Highway in the county a month ago, with dozens of machine guns and many pistols, grenades, and rifles. The weapons are better than the security police. Zhai Bogai's troops on the border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei fought fiercely with more than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Xiushan, Sichuan a month ago. In western Sichuan, a "democratic people's army" of several hundred people is active between Qionglai County and Mingshan. There are also armed uprisings active in the mountainous areas between northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi. The Sichuan authorities of the Kuomintang call them "bandits" and telegraphed the Shaanxi Provincial Committee last month to send troops to "jointly suppress" them.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. According to the Rong Huaxi Daily on the 12th of last month: In Zizhong County, Sichuan, hundreds of sugarcane farmers destroyed the county government and police station on January 8. Because the Kuomintang authorities in the county undervalued sugarcane, they aroused the anger of sugarcane farmers who rushed into the county government. The county magistrate and staff saw that there were many people and great momentum, so they escaped through the back door. The police actually opened fire and shot and killed two farmers. The masses became even more angry and resisted bravely. After a stalemate of hours, the police retreated, and the farmers then smashed the documents, utensils, doors and windows of the county government and police station in anger.
