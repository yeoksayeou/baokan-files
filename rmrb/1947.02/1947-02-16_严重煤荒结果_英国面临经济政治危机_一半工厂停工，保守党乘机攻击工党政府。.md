Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 14th: Comprehensive London news: The domestic economic crisis caused by the British coal shortage is becoming increasingly serious. It is said that over 50% of factories in the United Kingdom have now stopped working. On the 13th, a spokesman for the British Ministry of Commerce estimated that approximately five to six million workers have already lost their jobs, the majority due to this unprecedented coal shortage. It is said that crippling unemployment has spread to all sectors of British industry. More factories will close next week, which will inevitably lead to the expansion of unemployment to cities across the country, possibly developing into a subversion of the entire national economy. On the afternoon of the 10th, Attlee made an appeal to the nation in the House of Commons, asking the British people to cooperate with the Labour Party in this crisis. Conservative figures such as Churchill condemned the Labour government's handling of the crisis as "unqualified to occupy high positions." However, when a Labour Party member requested cooperation between the Conservative and Labour parties to alleviate the coal shortage and industrial crisis, Churchill rudely replied, "There is no possibility of unity." Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton also stated that the Labour Party currently has no intention of forming a coalition cabinet with the Conservative Party. The French Communist newspaper L'Humanité commented on the British crisis on the 12th, stating that "Foreign Secretary Bevin should be held responsible for the current most serious economic crisis." The newspaper criticized Bevin for keeping millions of laborers in the military, sacrificing the needs of Britain domestically.

The New York Herald Tribune, in an editorial on the 11th regarding the true cause of the current British crisis, also wrote, "The final analysis may prove that the lack of manpower cannot be resolved without significantly reducing the current armed forces of 1.5 million."

　　严重煤荒结果
    英国面临经济政治危机
    一半工厂停工，保守党乘机攻击工党政府。
    【新华社延安十四日电】综合伦敦消息：英国煤荒所造成的国内经济危机，已日形严重。据称：联合王国内百分之五十以上的工厂，现已停工。十三日，英商务部某发言人估计，约有五百万至六百万工人，已经失业，其中大部是由于此次空前未有的煤荒所致。据称：麻弊性的失业，已扩展及英国工业各部门，下周将有更多的工厂倒闭，随之而来的必是失业扩延及全国各都市。并可能发展为颠覆整个国家经济。十日下午，艾德礼在下院曾向全国呼吁，要求英人在此危难中与工党合作。保守党邱吉尔等，则谴责工党政府关于此次危机的处置，是“没有资格盘据高位”。但是当某工党人士提出要求保守党与工党合作，以谋减轻煤荒与工业危机时，邱吉尔则粗暴地回答道：“无联合之可言”。财长达尔顿亦称：工党目前无意与保守党组成联合内阁。法共人道报十二日评论英国危机时称：“贝文外相应对目前最严重的经济危机负责”。该报责备贝文保持成百万人的劳动力于军队中，以牺牲英国国内的需要。
    纽约先驱论坛报于十一日社论中，关于英国目前危机的真正原因，亦写道：“最后的分析，或可证明不把目前数达一百五十万的武装部队，予以相当地裁减，是无法解决人力的缺乏的”。
