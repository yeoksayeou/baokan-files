Jinnan District Party Committee Calls on Cadres to Return Excess Fruit

[Report from our Jinnan office on the 26th] The Jinnan District Party Committee recently convened a meeting of cadres above the county level. The meeting emphasized that the phenomenon of village cadres receiving too much fruit and district cadres and certain members of the turning-over teams buying fruit at low prices is a behavior that harms the interests of the masses and reflects a lack of a wholehearted service to the masses. In order to ensure that all the fruits belong to the masses and to thoroughly complete the land reform and adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, the above phenomenon should be corrected quickly. To this end, the District Party Committee specifically calls on leading organs at all levels to pay close attention, conduct in-depth inspections, strengthen the education of cadres in serving the masses wholeheartedly, and ensure that village and district cadres and certain members of the turning-over teams consciously return the excess fruit and the fruit bought at low prices to the masses.
