    Licheng Landlord Wan Zhuhua
    Joins Transportation Team for Production
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] Landlord Wan Zhuhua and others in Licheng and Shexian, who were subjected to liquidation, disregarded the idea of being parasites again and actively participated in production with the masses. Wan Zhuhua is a landlord from Xijian Village, Licheng. After liquidation this year, the masses left him enough land for cultivation, food, and clothing, but he was too lazy to move and wandered around the village all day long. When winter production began, district and village cadres persuaded him to get moving and mobilized him to join the sports team, where he worked with everyone every day. With everyone's help, he "quickly learned how to raise livestock." Similarly, Zhou Xian, a liquidated landlord in the same village, also participated in the cooperative to engage in production. The two of them said to their fellow villagers: "Since everyone doesn't treat us as outsiders, we will definitely rely on labor to eat in the future." Zhao Liye and Zhao Tingfang, landlords from Shuiyihe, District Three, Shexian, also participated in winter production after being liquidated, and they were very active. In less than a month, they each earned more than 20,000 yuan, which could buy 700 jin of millet. They repeatedly stated that they would be self-reliant in the future and would no longer be parasites. They also proposed to everyone: "Let's have a general evaluation before the Lunar New Year to see who is a model and who earns the most money." (Ren Qing, Zhi Sheng)

    黎城地主万株花
    参加运输队生产
    【本报太行讯】黎城、涉县被清算地主万株花等不顾再当寄生虫，与群众一起积极参加生产。万株花是黎城西件村地主，今年清算后，群众给留下足够耕种、吃穿的土地，但他赖得动弹，成天在村里转来转去。冬季生产开始，区村干部劝他动弹，动员他参加运动队，天天和大伙儿一起干，在大家帮助下“很快学会了养牲口。同样，该村被清算地主周贤也参加合作社闹生产。他俩对乡亲们说：“大家既不把我们当外人看待，后今后一定靠劳动吃饭。”涉县三区水溢河地主赵立业、赵廷芳，也在被清算后参加了冬季生产，且很积极，不到一个月就各赚洋两万多元，可买小米七百斤，他们一再表示今后要自食其力，不再当寄生虫。并向大家提出：“旧历年前来一次总评选，看谁模范，谁赚的钱多”。（任卿、志胜）
