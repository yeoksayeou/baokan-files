    [This Dispatch from Our Weixian Office, 9th] Jialiuzhuang, Guan County, completed land reform after investigation and reduction. Before the investigation and reduction, the village had 186 households with 808 people, owning 3430 mu of land. It was an old village with a working foundation. In the famine of 1932, a grain borrowing struggle was conducted, at which time there were 50 peasant association members, 64 women's association members, and 14 militia members. In 1934, a hired peasant movement and democratic struggle were launched. The number of peasant association members increased to 99, women's association members to 128, and militia members to 17. After several mobilizations of the masses, feudal exploitation was greatly weakened, but still not thoroughly eliminated. The land problems of the extremely poor and poor peasants had not been resolved. After the start of the investigation and reduction, representatives from the three district peasant associations, the village chief, the director of the armed forces committee, the director of the women's association, and the chairman and vice-chairman of the peasant association participated in the district peasant representative conference to study the implementation of land reform. After returning to the village, a village cadre meeting was convened to convey the resolutions of the district peasant representative conference, and a mass meeting was held to publicize policies and expand the organization. During the investigation and reduction, the peasant association developed 20 new members, the women's association 11 new members, and the militia added 10 new members, plus 72 children's corps members and 65 sister corps members, forming a total of 429 people in the village. Subsequently, groups were divided, and village cadres were assigned to lead specific discussions of policies, checking which households? How to treat the families of soldiers who are landlords? How to treat general landlords? How to treat despotic landlords? Initially, some of the masses felt that discussing it over and over again was too troublesome, but the majority of the masses thought this was good, that we the common people were truly in charge, and that discussing it several times was a good thing. After discussion, the masses adopted different methods and handling measures according to different targets, and carried out struggles, investigating a total of 120 mu of land, three tile-roofed houses, eight factory sheds, one flat house, five cattle, two carts, five millstones, and scattered furniture worth 4,632,17 yuan. The method of land distribution was to first convert it into standard land and then fill it up from the bottom up. Families of martyrs were given 3.5 mu per person, families of soldiers 3 mu, families of workers 2.7 mu, and general masses 2.3 mu. After the distribution, the class status of the masses changed. There were no more extremely poor people, 13 poor peasant households with 41 people, with a total of 108.1 mu of land, averaging 2.64 mu per person; 172 middle peasant households with 723 people, with a total of 3263.3 mu of land, averaging 4.277 mu per person; one rich peasant household with 4 people, with a total of 59.53 mu, averaging 14.93 mu per person; no landlords. After the floating wealth was evaluated and converted into value, one extremely poor household with one person received 40 shares, totaling 7,800 yuan; 43 poor peasant households with 95.5 people (including children's corps) received 1,225 shares, totaling 238,875 yuan; 39 poor middle peasant households with 84.5 people received 508 shares, totaling 98,670 yuan; 56 middle peasant households with 168 people received 413 shares, totaling 82,485 yuan; 20 rich middle peasant households with 47.5 people received 55.5 shares, totaling 10,822 yuan. Now the village has completely eliminated feudal landlords and eliminated extreme poverty, and the lives of poor peasants have been greatly improved.

    [This Dispatch from Our Weixian Office, 9th] The investigation and reduction movement in Wuyi County is entering a deeper stage. Cadres in the First District are carrying out the final work with unremitting and tireless spirit, completely cutting off the feudal tail, rationally distributing the fruits of victory, and establishing various organizations in the village. Most of the villages in the Second District have also ended the struggle, and the leadership is calling for the development of an inspection movement, with the following inspection contents: (1) Whether feudal landlords have been politically and economically defeated; (2) Whether there are middle peasants among the households that have been struggled against; (3) Whether the distribution of land is in accordance with the principle of leveling and filling, and whether the floating wealth is distributed according to the principles of population and class, and whether the distribution has been fully democratized through group discussions; (4) Whether there are disputes within the internal organization, whether it is democratic, and whether the various organizations are sound.
