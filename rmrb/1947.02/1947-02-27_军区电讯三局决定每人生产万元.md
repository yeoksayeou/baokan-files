Military Region Communications Bureau No. 3
    Decides Each Person Will Produce Ten Thousand Yuan

    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Communications Bureau No. 3, responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call, is launching a surge of production and thrift. After discussions in branch meetings and soldiers' meetings, the bureau selected an economic committee and decided on a target of ten thousand yuan per person. In terms of agricultural production, each section, squad, and platoon has found land, and many comrades have now learned to spin yarn. The medic, Comrade Tang Jinchang, was a prisoner from the Ping-Han Campaign and was a labor hero last year, handing in two thousand catties of vegetables and earning over ten thousand yuan. This year, as soon as production was mentioned, he built a plot of land in the river ditch and carries manure to the field before dawn. In addition to farming, he will knit ten sweaters and guarantees to provide all his own shoes. In addition to guaranteeing the completion of their work tasks, the communications squad will participate in labor services through mutual aid. Recently, they participated in repairing houses and carrying yams, earning an average of five hundred yuan per person. The technicians of each radio station are also taking action. The second detachment gins cotton for the people, charging only thirteen yuan per catty (market price is twenty-five yuan), and can gin forty catties of cotton per day. In terms of conservation: In January, the medium-sized mess hall was canceled. Plans and measures for saving on office supplies and lamp oil have been formulated. (Zhao Bin)

　　军区电讯三局
    决定每人生产万元
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫军区电讯三局响应薄一波同志号召，掀起生产节约热潮。该局经过支部大会与军人大会的讨论，选出经济委员会，决定每人一万元的任务。农业生产方面，各科、班、排都找到了地，许多同志现在已经学会纺线。卫生员唐金昌同志是平汉战役的俘虏，去年是劳动英雄，交菜两千斤，得钱一万余元；今年一提出生产，他就在河沟里修了一块地，天不亮就把粪担到地里去。除种地外他还要打十件毛衣，并保证全部鞋子自给。通讯班的人除了保证工作任务完成外，要以变工互助的方法参加劳役。最近参加修房子和担山药蛋，每人平均赚五百元。各电台的技术人员，也都行动起来。二分队给老百姓轧花，每斤只要十三元的工钱（市价二十五元），一天可轧四十斤花。节约方面：一月份取消了中灶。对办公用具及灯油都订出节约计划与办法。（赵宾）
