    Important Correction
    In Chairman Yang's report on page one of this newspaper on the 13th, "We received UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplies, totaling only 2,400,000 tons so far," the character "hundred" was mistakenly printed as "ten thousand." Also, the headline of the last item on page two of the same day should be "Comfort Bags Sent to the Front Lines."

    重要更正
    本报十三日一版杨主席报告中，“我们得到联总救济物资，截至目前只二千四百余吨”，其中“百”字误为“万”字。又同日二版末条消息标题应为“送给前线慰问袋”。
