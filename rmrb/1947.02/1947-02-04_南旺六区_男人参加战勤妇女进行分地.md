(This dispatch from the JiluYu [Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan] Border Region, dated 30th) In Nanwang Sixth District, 24 villages, with the heavy burden of war support tasks, many women engaged in speaking bitterness, promoting the land reform movement. Comrade Sun Fang from Nanxi Caomiao, a housewife in her forties who had only recently left production less than a year ago, upon returning from a district meeting, summoned the women in the village and asked them if they wanted land. Most said they did. She then asked why the land should be taken back. Everyone was silent. She said: We must "uproot poverty," but everyone remained silent. She then pointed to an elderly woman and said: "Second Sister-in-law, do you still remember the year you didn't light the stove for three days?" She said, "How could I not remember? That year, begging for food was impossible, and often the stove wasn't lit for three days." Before she finished speaking, another person immediately said: "That year, eating grain husks caused constipation..." and everyone began to recount their suffering. On the third day, with women as the backbone, a mass meeting was held. After several people spoke of their suffering, everyone's awareness was raised, and they decided to take back the land of landlords like Han Youlan and others, and elected land evaluation members to calculate how much each person should make up. Several women in Zhao Lou, when discussing "Should we poor people be given land to cultivate?" all recounted their own hardships. The mother of three children said: "Our eight family members originally had eighteen mu of land. In the year of famine, we borrowed food and money from others, and with interest accruing, we now only have eight fen of land left. Now that we have turned over and are struggling, we should have a good life." Then, Li Daofu's mother said: "Once, when I went to Caomiao to beg for food, I walked on the edge of landlord Han Yongwen's land. He insisted that I stole his wheat. I argued with him, and he beat me. After returning home, I was in pain and cried half the night, and was so angry that I was delirious for more than a month, and didn't even get to glean wheat." Those women were extremely hateful when they heard her tell about the bad deeds of the landlord, and shouted: "The land was originally cultivated by poor people with their labor, and we should let the land return to its old home for the New Year." Thus, with the active participation of women, twelve villages in Nanwang Sixth District implemented land reform within twelve days, and the masses in another twelve villages are also actively carrying out land distribution.

    男人参加战勤妇女进行分地
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】南旺六区廿四村，在战勤任务繁忙下，许多妇女进行诉苦，推动了土地改革运动。南西草庙的孙方同志，是个刚脱离生产不到一年的四十来岁的家庭妇女，她由区开会回来，便召集村里妇女，问她们愿要地不要，大部分说愿要。他又提出为什么要收回土地？大家都不说话。她说：咱们得“刨穷根”，大家也不吭声。她即指着个有年纪的老婆婆说：“二嫂子，你还记得那年你三天不动锅不？”她说：“我还能不记得，那年要饭要不到吃的，常常三天不动锅”。她的话还没完，另一人即说：“那年吃谷糠拉不下屎来………………”，大家即诉起苦来。第三天，又以妇女为骨干，召开了群众会，经过几个人的诉苦，大家觉悟提高，决定要收回韩有兰等三家地主的地，并选出评地员，算出每人该补齐多少。赵楼的几个妇女在讨论到“咱穷人该分地种不？”的时候，都拉起自己的苦处来。三个孩的娘说：“俺八口人原有十八亩地，闹荒那年借了人家的粮食和钱，还利滚的俺如今还剩八分地，现在翻身斗争啦，俺可该过好日子了”。接着李道福的娘说：“有一回俺上草庙要饭，在地主韩永文地头间走，他硬说俺偷他的麦子啦，俺和他分辩了两句，他就打了俺一顿，回家后俺疼得叫了半夜，气得迷了一个多月，也没捞着拾麦”。那些妇女听她说出了地主的这些坏事，都恨极了，嚷嚷着说：“地原都是受穷人出力治的，咱就该叫土地回老家来过年。”这样在妇女积极参加下，南旺六区前后十二天内，有十二个村实行了土地改革，还有十二个村的群众也积极的进行分地。
