(Reported from Weixian on the 5th of this month) The Jinnan First Prefectural Committee issued instructions to all its subordinate counties, pointing out that as the war has affected Yuancheng, Guanxian, and Guantao counties, in addition to actively organizing to defend themselves and crush the attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, they should continue to carry out the great inspection movement of emancipation to ensure the thorough completion of land reform before the spring plowing. The instructions pointed out that new areas should pay attention to: (1) Launching liquidation struggles against landlords who have been missed, to completely eliminate feudal rule and exploitation. (2) Quickly distributing the fruits of the struggle to the masses. Only by distributing the fruits fairly and reasonably to the masses can the principle of "land to the tiller" be realized. Distributing the fruits to the masses sooner will allow them to prepare fertilizers, seeds, and mutual aid for cultivation earlier, laying the foundation for this year's great production movement. (3) Great attention should be paid to checking whether the interests of middle peasants have been damaged during the mass movement of land reform. For middle peasants who have been wrongly struggled against, their land and movable property should be resolutely returned, so as to achieve the goal of uniting well with the middle peasants. (4) Further raise the class consciousness of the masses. It is necessary to universally launch "thinking sessions" to allow each person to recount the suffering they endured under feudal exploitation and the fruits of struggle they gained after land reform. This will allow them to understand that the Communist Party is their savior, Chiang Kai-shek is the mortal enemy of the peasants, and only by following the Communist Party and repelling the attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits can the peasants live a happy and peaceful life. It will also allow them to specifically discuss how each person can plant "rich seedlings" and build a family business. In addition, it was pointed out that the masses in the old areas, after three major mobilizations, had thoroughly eliminated feudal rule and exploitation, but after the investigation and rent reduction ended, they shifted to tasks such as joining the army, preparing for war, and providing war service, leaving many problems unresolved. Therefore, it is necessary to fairly, reasonably, quickly, and thoroughly distribute the fruits of the investigation to the masses, resolutely return the land and property wrongly calculated as belonging to middle peasants, universally hold "thinking sessions" to consolidate the emancipation position ideologically, and conduct education on production and prosperity.

    冀南一地委指示各县检查翻身
    【本报威县五日电】战争波及元朝、冠县、馆陶三县，一地委向所属各县发出指示，指出：除积极组织起来，进行自卫粉碎蒋贼的进攻外，应继续开展翻身大检查运动，保证在春耕前彻底完成土地改革。指示指出新区应注意：（一）向遗漏的地主开展清算斗争，以达彻底消灭封建统治剥削。（二）迅速把果实分到群众手里，只有把果实公平合理的分配到群众手里，耕者有其田才算实现，把果实早分到群众手里，群众就早一天准备肥料种籽和互助耕地，就给今年大生产运动打下了基础。（三）要十分注意检查土地在群众大动中是否损伤了中农利益，对于被斗争的中农应当坚决退回其土地和浮财，以便达到好好团结中农的目的。（四）进一步提高群众的阶级觉悟，必须普遍展开想想会，使群众每个人诉出在封建剥削下所受到的苦，及经过土地改革后所得的斗争果实，使他们了解到共产党是他的救命恩人，蒋介石是农民的死敌人，只有跟着共产党走，只有打退蒋贼进攻，农民才能幸福过太平日子，并具体讨论每个人怎样栽富苗，兴家立业。此外指出老区群众经过三次大发动，彻底消灭了封建统治与剥削，但查减结束后，转入参军备战及战勤等工作，遗留下很多问题，没有解决。因此必须把查出的果实公平合理、迅速彻底的分配到群众手里，坚决退回误算中农的土地财物，及普遍开想想会，从思想上巩固翻身阵地，并进行生产发家教育。
