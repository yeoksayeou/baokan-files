[This report from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 11th] The land reform movement in Wangwu has turned to the river defense zone along the border. Despite the threat of firepower from Chiang's troops across the river, the accounting and land distribution continue as usual. The people in the river defense zone, which stretches for 125 li along the Yellow River, are persistently fighting the landlords day and night in a harsh environment, reclaiming their land and property. The villages of Dajiao and Xiaojiao in the first district are right on the riverbank. After hearing the news of land distribution in the old liberated areas, the peasants organized themselves to monitor the enemy on the opposite bank while simultaneously struggling against the landlords. The peasants said, "People depend on land, tigers depend on mountains. For the sake of the land, we are willing to fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death." Luoyu Village in the third district is a front哨 in the river defense zone, constantly under the threat of fire from across the river, but the masses still shouted thunderously as they settled accounts and carried grain with the landlord Cui Zhuxing. After discovering this, Chiang's troops frantically strafed with machine guns, but this did not deter the resolute masses. On the contrary, the masses shouted, "As long as you, Chiang Kai-shek, have bullets, keep shooting! We will still carry the grain back to our homes, and the land will still be distributed." That evening, Chiang's troops gathered a group of fleeing landlords and shouted across the river, threatening the masses, "I will be back in a couple of days. Whoever dares to touch my land will be in trouble when I return!" This further angered the masses, who replied, "You weren't home when the land was distributed. When you come back, we will settle accounts with you." The twenty-four members of the Land Reform Committee in Jiaoyu Village swore to share life and death and to fight to defend the land of the masses after the land distribution. After the struggle, they also appropriately took care of the lives of the landlords and those who had returned from fleeing. For example, Gao × Qi, the father of Gao Lingyun, Wangwu's biggest special agent, was captured when our army liberated Yuanqu, but he was still left with land for production. He said with emotion, "Everyone did not punish me, and even left me land. This is truly generous to me."

    不怕炮火威胁武装保卫翻身
    王屋百余里河防区
    农民日夜清算分田
    【本报太岳十一日电】王屋土地改革运动转向边沿的河防区，在河对岸蒋军火力威胁下，照常算账分田。沿黄河一百二十五里的河防区民，在严重的环境下，坚持不懈的与地主日夜进行斗争，收回自己的土地与财产。一区大交、小交两村就在河边上，农民听到了老区分配土地的消息，组织起来一面武装监视对岸敌人，一面斗争地主。农民们说：“人凭土地虎凭山，为了土地和蒋介石拼命也干。”三区落峪村是河防区的前哨，随时可以受到对岸火力威胁，但群众仍喊声如雷的与地主崔柱兴算账、扛粮食，对岸蒋军发觉后，疯狂的用机枪扫射，但并未吓退坚决斗争的群众，相反的群众高喊着：“只要你蒋介石有子弹，尽管打吧！粮食还要扛回我家里，土地还要分配。”当晚蒋军又集中一伙逃亡地主，在对岸喊话，威胁群众说：“我三两天就过去了，谁敢动我的土地回去可不行！”这更激怒了群众，回答道：“你不在家把土地分了，你回来咱们还要和你算账。”焦域村土地改革委员会二十四个委员，在分完土地后，宣誓同生死共患难，为保卫群众土地而奋斗。在斗争后又适当的照顾了地主与逃亡归来户的生活，如王屋最大特务头子高凌云父高×歧，被我军解放垣曲时俘虏回来，仍给他留下生产地，他感动地说：“大家不制裁我，又给我留下土地，真是宽大我了。”
