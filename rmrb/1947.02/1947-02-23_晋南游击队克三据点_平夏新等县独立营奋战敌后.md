Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Lu-Yu, 21st: The Jinan Guerrilla Detachment recovered the towns of Qucun and Liangzhen between Yicheng and Quwo on the evening of the 4th, and the Yaotou stronghold of Pinglu on the 13th, eliminating 263 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops.

Our newspaper, Taiyue, 21st: Around January, the independent battalions of various counties in the third sub-district of Taiyue were active behind enemy lines, crushing the destructive mopping-up offensives of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. A total of 145 enemies were eliminated, and three machine guns, 18 rifles and other spoils of war were captured. The Xia County Independent Battalion fought 33 battles, eliminating 56 enemies and collecting more than 400 catties of electric wire. The ambush at Gaozhuang, in particular, which wiped out an enemy platoon, was praised throughout the region. The Pinglu Independent Battalion blocked an enemy force ten times its size at Niangniangmiao on December 28th, holding out for 24 hours and covering the safe transfer of the masses. On January 5th, the battalion attacked the enemy at Wa, killing or wounding more than 30 enemies and capturing one machine gun. The Xinjiang Independent Battalion penetrated the "grid network" south of the Fen River to attack the enemy, operating over 200 miles, fighting six battles and killing or capturing 43 enemies. The Anyi Independent Battalion cut off all enemy power lines between Wang (Yu) and Xia (County), An (Yi), and attacked Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds such as the Xihu Salt Flats, killing 12 enemies. The Taiyue Third Sub-district issued a special commendation to the above independent battalions.

Our newspaper, Taiyue, 21st: The military and civilians of Jinan, who have undergone ten months of arduous struggle, have gained preliminary experience in persisting in guerrilla warfare:

One, to persist in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, it is necessary to adopt struggle methods such as centralized transfer, dispatch activities, decentralized persistence, secret concealment, and advancing as the enemy advances, based on specific circumstances. Blind persistence and fearful flight are both wrong. When the enemy implements point-line occupation, the guerrillas should basically adopt small-scale decentralization and persist in the struggle. If single individuals are dispersed or concealed, they are easily captured by the enemy and are easily shaken by pessimistic emotions from their families or the masses. It is also not advisable to concentrate activities frequently, so as to avoid detaching from the masses and creating favorable conditions for the enemy. When the enemy carries out area occupation with strong forces, it is advisable to temporarily implement centralized transfer. Then, in groups of several people, actively carry out alternating dispatch activities, gradually grasp the enemy's situation and unite with the masses; then use them for larger dispatch activities, and longer-term persistence and decentralized guerrilla warfare. In older liberated areas, if the enemy occupies points and lines, we should implement decentralized guerrilla warfare and siege and harassment. If small groups of enemies attack, we should combine explosions and implement joint defense operations. If the enemy "clears and suppresses" with large forces, we should use explosions to block and quickly cover the transfer of the masses, and then immediately move to the empty enemy rear to operate. Some cadres in the plains once adopted a die-hard approach, and when in danger, mechanically adhered to the principle of secret concealment, which did not yield good results.

Two, in the environment of frequent battles in guerrilla warfare, all organizational forms should be militarized and combatized. Those who leave the county and district where they are located should be concentrated to form a county and district headquarters. Personnel not related to the war should be transferred to the rear. If various systems and departments persist in preserving and commanding the original organization and personnel, it will inevitably affect the whole. Xinjiang County has done a better job in this regard, in addition to resettling personnel unrelated to the war in a rear area, the rest are uniformly organized into an independent team. Cadres are all organized according to the army's structure, and duties are re-determined, and the transferred militia and guerrillas are uniformly combined. This not only solved the militia supply problem (the same supply as the guerrillas), but also quickly improved the militia's combat effectiveness. Cadres should go deep into mobilization and explanation, eliminate the militia's concerns about regularization, and ensure that they can freely return home after fighting back to their old homes. Therefore, the militia's fighting spirit is very high.

Three, in Xia County in December, 30 militia members in one district turned against the enemy and returned to our side with their weapons. In carrying out the work of winning them over, the cadres were all able to understand. Because most of the militia who turned to the enemy were forced or deceived. When they return, they should first be comforted, not insulted or monitored, and they should be used boldly. Those who have been connected to the enemy with a joint security system, and who are afraid to return immediately, but have already sent letters declaring their intentions, should be forgiven, and it should be pointed out what work they can do.

　　晋南游击队克三据点
    平夏新等县独立营奋战敌后
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫廿一日电】晋南游击队四日晚收复翼城、曲沃间之曲村镇、量镇，十三日收复平陆之窑头据点，消灭蒋伪军二百六十三名。
    【本报太岳二十一日电】一月前后，太岳三分区各县独立营，活跃敌后，粉碎蒋伪军毁灭性扫荡进攻。计歼敌一四五名，缴机枪三挺，长短枪一十八支及其他胜利品甚多。夏县独立营作战三十三次，歼敌五十六名，收割电线四百余斤。尤以高庄伏击战，歼敌一个班，传颂全区。平陆独立营，十二月二十八日在娘娘庙阻击十倍之敌，坚持一昼夜，掩护群众安全转移。一月五日，该营袭击在瓦之敌，毙伤敌三十余人，缴机枪一挺。新绛独立营深入汾南“格子网”袭敌，纵横二百余里，作战六次，毙俘敌四十三名。安邑独立营将王（峪）夏（县）、安（邑）间敌电线全部割毁，并出击西湖盐地等蒋伪据点，毙敌十二名，太岳三分区特通令表扬上述各独立营。
    【本报太岳二十一日电】经历十个月艰苦奋斗的晋南军民已取得坚持游击战争的初步经验：
    一、要坚持敌后游击战争必须根据具体情况，及时采用集中转移，派遣活动，分散坚持，秘密隐蔽及敌进我进等斗争方式。盲目坚持和畏惧逃跑都是不对的。敌实行点线占领时，游击队基本上应采小型分散，坚持斗争。如用单人分散或隐蔽极易被敌抓去和易受家庭或群众悲观情绪影响而动摇。亦不宜常集中活动，以免脱离群众，给敌造成有利条件。在敌人以强大兵力实行面的占领时，宜暂实行集中转移。而后数人一组，积极进行轮番的派遣活动，逐渐掌握敌情和结合群众；然后用为较大派遣活动，和较长期坚持与分散游击。在较老的解放区，敌如占领点线，我宜实行分散游击和围困袭扰。小股敌人出犯，我宜结合爆炸，实行联防作战，敌以大兵“清剿”，我应以爆炸阻击，迅速掩护群众转移，然后立即绕至空虚的敌后活动。曾有个别平地干部采用死打硬拚，危险时又机械坚持秘密隐蔽方针，都没得到良好结果。
    二、在战斗频繁的游击战争环境中，一切组织形式皆应军事化，战斗化。离开所在县区地方的，应集中组成县区指挥部。与战争无关人员应转移后方。如各系统、部门坚持保存并指挥原有组织和人员，势必影响整体。新绛县在这方面做得较好，除将与战争无关的人员另安置一个后方，其余都统一编成一个独立队。干部全按军队编制，从新决定职务，并把转移出来的民兵和游击队统一合编。这不但解决了民兵供给问题（和游击队同样供给），并很快提高了民兵的战斗力。干部应深入动员解释，消除民兵怕正规化的顾虑，保证打回老家后，可自由回家。因此民兵战斗情绪很高。
    三、夏县十二月一个区里即有三十名投敌民兵摧枪反正。在进行争取工作中，干部皆能谅解。因民兵投敌多是被迫或被骗的。他们反正回来要首先安慰他们，不污辱，不监视，而且放手使用他们。对曾向敌具有连环保、不敢马上回来、但已捎信声明的民兵，应予原谅，并指出他们可能作的工作。
