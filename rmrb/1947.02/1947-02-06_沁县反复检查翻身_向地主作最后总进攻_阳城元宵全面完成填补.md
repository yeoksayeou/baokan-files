    [Report from our Taiyue office on the 3rd] Qin County has begun a deep and meticulous land reform verification campaign, and has created several new methods. Under the slogan of "No family left without land to cultivate, no poor person left without liberation," they have decided to conduct repeated checks, completely eradicate the roots of poverty for farmers, and launch a final general offensive against feudal landlords. The Chengguan and Guyi base areas held fruit exhibitions, bringing all the fruits of the farmers' labor since land reform for review. This gave great encouragement and enlightenment to farmers who had not fully liberated themselves, and they actively requested to participate in the struggle again. Villages such as Kou Tou conducted door-to-door inspections by groups and households, and the problems discovered were dealt with separately every night. Liujia Gou conducted three inspections, discovering more than 30 problems. Therefore, the Guyi base area re-struggled "Five Tigers," and Fancun re-struggled "King Yama." For disputes between farmers, the "Jie Ta Ge" method was used for mediation. Some villages, although frequently harassed by the enemy in the past, had weak militia forces and unconsolidated organizations because farmers had not completely freed themselves from feudal oppression. After land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for protecting their land soared, and they actively participated in the militia. For example, in villages such as Beili and Xiaowang, there were no militia at all six months ago, but now they have developed into male and female ××× people, guarding their land with guns day and night, and intensifying their martial arts training. The women's militia are determined to learn the three major skills of explosion, shooting, and grenade throwing, and are preparing to keep pace with men in protecting their homes and land.

    [Report from our office] In Guyi Village, Qin County, Taiyue, all 48 households, except for four targets of struggle, have received fruits of their labor. Through the distribution of fruits, 19 poor peasant households rose to middle peasant status, and one destitute household rose to poor peasant status. All 123 mu of land and five head of cattle in the village have been returned to the farmers from the hands of the local despots and landlords. Now everyone is concerned about the few farmers who have not been completely liberated. The farmers' association has organized a expedition team to go to other villages to assist farmers who have not been completely liberated in their struggle.

    [Report from our Taiyue office on the 3rd] More than 30 villages in Yangcheng have completed land reform, and more than 20 villages are distributing the fruits of their labor. It is expected that all leveling and replenishment will be completed by the Lantern Festival. Although the land reform in Yangcheng has taken a long time, it is thorough and meticulous, and has gained preliminary experience: (1) Conduct struggles by village. Large villages will have larger struggles and smaller villages will have smaller struggles. After several years of rent and interest reduction movements in the Second, Fifth, and Sixth Districts, the large feudal despots and landlords have been destroyed or weakened, while feudal vestiges are mostly hidden in mountain villages and small ravines. Therefore, the flames of struggle have been ignited in each small village. The leadership should call on each village to hold meetings to struggle over their own problems. Those related to the entire village should be liquidated in a large meeting, so as not to waste time and to allow the masses to fully express their grievances. (2) Distribute the fruits of labor with mutual assistance and concession. In Hujia Village in the Sixth District, more than 30 households, except for a few landlord households, all need land, but the land obtained through struggle is only more than 80 mu. The small villages are also numerous, and the households are scattered, making it inconvenient to cultivate. Therefore, the masses put forward the slogan of "mutual assistance and concession," and the land was adjusted according to its quality. As a result, the masses who needed land were very satisfied. (3) Use symposiums to resolve disputes between farmers. In Hanshang Village in the First District, both parties with disputes between farmers were gathered together to peacefully resolve their concerns.

### 沁县反复检查翻身  向地主作最后总进攻  阳城元宵全面完成填补

    沁县反复检查翻身
    向地主作最后总进攻
    阳城元宵全面完成填补
    【本报太岳三日电】沁县开始转入深入细致的翻身检查运动，并创造出几种新的办法。他们在“不让一家没地种，不留一个穷人没翻身”的口号下，决定三番五次的进行检查，彻底斩断农民的穷根，向封建地主作最后总进攻。城关、固亦两基点进行果实展览，将农民自翻身以来所得果实全部拿来检阅了一次。这样给了未翻透身的农民一个很大的鼓励和启示，并积极要求重新参加斗争。口头等村分组分户的沿门检阅，每天晚上将所发现的问题分别处理。刘家沟曾反复进行了三次检查，发现问题三十余件，因此固亦基点，再斗“五只虎”，樊村重斗“阎王”，对农民之间的纠纷采用“解塔圪”的办法，进行调解。有些村庄过去虽不时遭受敌人的袭扰，但因农民未彻底解脱封建压迫，所以民兵武装薄弱，组织不巩固，翻身后农民保田情绪高涨，踊跃参加民兵。如北里、小王等村，六个月前根本无民兵，现在发展为男女×××人，日夜持枪保卫自己的土地，并加紧练武。妇女民兵决心学会爆炸、射击、投弹三大技术，准备与男人并驾齐驱保家保田。
    【本报讯】太岳沁县固亦全村四十八户人家，除了四户斗争对象外，其他全部得到果实。经过果实的分配，使十九户贫农上升为中农，一户赤贫上升为贫农。全村的一百廿三亩土地及五头耕牛，已经从恶霸地主手中，归还农民了。现在大家都很关心几户未翻透身的农民，农会组织了远征小组，出发到其他村子，协助未翻透身的农民进行斗争。
    【本报太岳三日电】阳城已有三十余村完成土地改革，二十余村正进行分配果实，预计元宵节即可全部填平补齐。阳城土地改革虽时间较长，但深入细致，并获得初步经验：（一）分庄斗争，大的大斗，小的小斗。二、五、六区经过几年的减租减息运动，大的封建恶霸地主皆被摧毁或削弱，而封建尾巴多隐藏于山庄小沟。因此各个小庄燃起斗争烈火，领导上应时号召各庄的问题各自集会斗争，有关全村者大会清算，一则不让浪费时间。二则群众可尽情诉苦。（二）分配果实互助互让。六区护驾村三十余户除数户地主外，都需要土地，但斗争出的土地仅八十余亩，小庄又多，住户分散，不便耕种，于是群众提出“互助互让”的口号，以土地好坏进行调剂，结果要地的群众都很满意。（三）以座谈会形式解决农民间纠纷。一区汉上村将农民间有纠纷的双方都召集一块，和和气气的解决了心事。
