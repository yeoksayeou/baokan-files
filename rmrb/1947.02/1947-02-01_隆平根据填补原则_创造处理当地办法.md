[This Dispatch from Weixian on the 30th] During the rent reduction movement, Longping has created some new methods for dealing with local problems. When allocating land in Longping villages according to the principle of filling in and leveling up disparities, some farmers raised concerns: "Will the land I'm farming under a mortgage agreement be counted? If it is, and someone redeems the land, I'll have no land at all." Others said, "If mortgaged land isn't counted, the mortgagee benefits too much. Even if the land is eventually redeemed, there's still value in it. It's unreasonable not to count it."

The solution adopted by the Xiaozhuang district was:

1.  Land mortgaged by landlords to middle and poor peasants to escape burdens or due to temporary inconvenience, regardless of whether the term had expired, was to be taken over by the farmers' association. Then, a portion of land would be retained, valued, and cut off to compensate the mortgagee for the loss. The retained land would be treated as a permanent sale, with the price calculated according to the market price for permanently sold land. This method was adopted because the farmers' association had no special funds to redeem the land. If movable property were sold to redeem it, the middle peasants who hoped to share in the movable property would be unwilling. In Xiaozhuang, 38 households of landlords were struggled against, mortgaging a total of 304 mu of land to 85 mortgagee households. By valuing the land, the mortgagee households retained a total of 36 mu. Those who retained enough for one mu or more kept the original plot, while those with only a fraction had their original plots completely allocated to the farmers' association. The farmers' association allocated the complete plots to several mortgagee households for joint cultivation (or the land could be sold and the proceeds distributed).

2.  For middle peasants who did not receive land allocation, the existing mortgage relationships between them remained unchanged.

3.  For middle peasants who did not receive enough land and poor-middle and poor peasants who did receive land, if there were mortgage relationships, the mortgage price paid by the mortgagee would be converted into mu based on the price of permanently sold land, counting it as their own land. This was called "valuing and counting as permanent sale." The mortgagor, after deducting the land valued and counted as permanently sold by the mortgagee, would still have the remaining land registered in their name. This was called "reserving space and counting the amount." For example, if someone mortgaged 5 mu of land to another person for 5,000 yuan, and the market price for permanently sold land (before the mass movement) was 5,000 yuan per mu, when allocating land to the first person to level it up, that person would be counted as having one mu of land, while the second person would have 4 mu "reserved" in their name. There were many such cases in the farmers' association. In Xiaozhuang's 93 households, 25 mu of land were "valued and counted as permanent sale," and 200 mu of land were "reserved" for the mortgagors.

4.  For land mortgaged by poor peasants to other poor peasants, the principle was to eliminate the mortgage relationship, either by converting it to a permanent sale or by redeeming it at the original price. This method was only implemented if both parties could have their land holdings leveled out.

Other villages adopted different methods. For landlords' mortgaged land, some was taken over by the farmers' association, some was compensated by the farmers' association, some received no compensation, and some was redeemed by the landlords themselves. For mortgage relationships between middle and poor peasants, the mortgagee and mortgagor each calculated half, but the contract remained unchanged. For poor peasants mortgaging to other poor peasants, the mortgage relationship was to be eliminated, with the original owner redeeming the land. Some individual villages proposed completely eliminating mortgage relationships, not allowing any redemption at all, and having the farmers' association rewrite the contracts as permanent sales. This method was opposed by middle peasants who did not receive enough land, as it benefited those who mortgaged a lot of land.

### 隆平根据填补原则  创造处理当地办法

　　隆平根据填补原则
    创造处理当地办法
    【本报威县三十日电】在查减运动中，关于当地问题，隆平创造了一些新的办法。隆平各村以填平补齐原则分配土地时，有的农民提出：“我种着当契地能算数吗？如果算数，人家把地赎走，我就没有地了。”有的说：“当契地不算数，承当人太占便宜，即便将来地被赎回，还有价在，不算数可不合理。”解决这个问题，萧庄小区的办法是：一、地主为了逃避负担，或因一时不便当给中贫农的土地，不管到年限与否，一律收归农会，然后留地作价，割下一块补偿承当户损失。留地作为死契，价按死契地时价算。这种办法是因为农会无专款赎地，如变卖浮财去赎，分不到土地希望分浮财的中农就不愿意。萧庄三十八户被斗地主，共当出地三○四亩承当者八十五户，以地作价，承当户共留下了三六亩，承当户留的够一亩以上者就留原地，几分者即将原地完全拨给农会，农会拨给整地块，给几家承当户伙种（亦可变价分款）。二、中农分不到土地者，相互间的典当关系，一概不变。三、填不到土地的中农和填到土地的贫中农及贫农，如有典当关系，承当人出的当价按死契地价折合为亩数，算作自有地，然后进行填补，这叫做“计价算死”；出当人除去承当人计价算死地外，余地要仍在本人名下，这叫“留空算数”。例如某甲当了某乙地五亩，出当价五千元，死契地时价（群运发动前）每亩五千元，给某甲填平土地时，某甲按有了一亩地计算，而某乙名下留空四亩。农会中这类问题很多，萧庄九十三户中，“计价算死”地二五亩，给出当人“留空算数”地二百亩。四、贫农当给贫农的土地，原则上是消灭典当关系，或改为死契，或按价赎回，这个办法一定在双方能够填平土地的情况下实行。其他村的办法，地主的当契地，有的收归农会，有的由农会给价，有的不给，也有由地主出价赎回的。中贫农之间有典当关系，则承当人与出当人各按一半计算，但不变动契约，贫农与贫农之间，要消灭典当关系，由原主赎回。个别村庄提出典当关系完全消灭，根本不许赎回，由农会改写死契，这个办法，填不到土地的中农不同意，种当契地多的就沾光了。
