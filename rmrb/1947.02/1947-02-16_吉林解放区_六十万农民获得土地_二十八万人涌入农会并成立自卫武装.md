　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: In the Jilin Liberated Area, 600,000 peasants have obtained an average of more than five mu of land per person. Land reform in the entire area began in July of last year; by November, it had initially come to an end in most areas. Within five months, land distribution work had been completed in 365 of the 605 villages in Yanji, Helong, Changchun, Dunhua, and Jiaohe counties. In Wangqing, Emu, and Antu counties, 278 of the 406 villages had also been completed. The highest amount of land received per person in Emu was seven mu, and the lowest in Wangqing and Helong was five and a half mu. After the masses obtained land, they were enthusiastic, with 280,000 people joining mass organizations such as peasant associations and women's associations, and establishing self-defense forces. The masses in Wangqing, Yanji, and Emu seized more than 1,000 long and short guns from traitors and local bullies. In the Yongji (North) area along the border, people shouted: "If we don't protect the land, we will not be worthy of our ancestors above, nor of our descendants below."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: According to people from Jinan, the vigorous land reform in the Shandong Liberated Area has aroused good reactions and support from people of all classes in Jinan. The vast number of coolies, poor people, and vendors in the city are extremely happy that their families in the Liberated Area have obtained land and their lives are becoming increasingly prosperous. They all say: "We have lived in the city for many years and haven't earned a penny. Thanks to the Communist Party, our families have enough to eat and wear. If we can't make a living here in the future, we'll go back home to farm." Landlords who fled to the cities after listening to rumors from secret agents have returned to the Liberated Area one after another because the Liberated Area has left them enough land to maintain their livelihoods during the land reform, and because the Chiang-occupied cities are full of heavy and numerous taxes, making it impossible to live.

    六十万农民获得土地
    二十八万人涌入农会并成立自卫武装
    【新华社东北十三日电】吉林解放区已有六十万农民平均每人得地五亩以上。全区土地改革始于去年七月；至十一月，在大部地区初步告一段落。在五个月内，延吉、和龙、长春、敦化、蛟河五县，六百零五乡中已有三百六十五乡完成分地工作。汪清、额穆、安图三县，四百零六屯亦完成了二百七十八屯。额穆每人得地最高数为七亩，汪清、和龙最低数为五亩半。群众得地后，情绪热烈，有二十八万人涌入农会、妇女会等群众团体，并成立了自卫武装，汪清、延吉、额穆群众，从汉奸恶霸手中收缴长短枪一千余支，边沿区永（吉）北等地人民高喊着：“不保田，上对不起祖先，下对不起子孙”。
    【新华社山东十三日电】据济南来人谈，山东解放区轰轰烈烈的土地改革已引起济南各阶层人士的良好反映与拥护，市内广大苦力贫民小贩等，对其家属在解放区分得土地，生活日趋富裕，莫不欣喜异常。他们都说：“俺们在城市里住了多年，没挣下一个钱，家里靠共产党的福，有吃有穿了，今后这里不能混，就回家种地。”听信特务谣言逃亡城市内的地主，由于解放区在土地改革中都给他们留有足够维持生活的土地，更兼蒋占城市苛杂繁重，无法生活，相率逃回解放区。
