　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 29th, State Department news official McDermot declared today (the 29th) that "Instructions for the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps stationed in China will soon be issued, in line with the US plan to withdraw from the Executive Headquarters." According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 30th, "A considerable number of US troops stationed in China may be recalled." "However, approximately 3,000 US armed forces personnel will remain, with 1,000 to 2,000 Marines staying in Qingdao." (Note: The Chinese people have consistently demanded the complete withdrawal of all US troops stationed in China, but the US State Department official's statement does not explicitly state whether the US Navy, Air Force, and military advisory group stationed in China will be withdrawn. Even according to the US Information Service dispatch, at least approximately 3,000 US armed forces personnel will continue to be stationed in China in the future, which still infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and violates the wishes of the Chinese people.)
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: A Washington dispatch on the 30th stated: "Regarding the US announcement on Wednesday of its decision to terminate relations with the Three-Man Group, it is generally believed that a considerable number of US troops stationed in China may be recalled. Currently, there are 12,000 US Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel in China, including over 900 Marines, most of whom are assigned to support the Executive Headquarters in Beiping. The Executive Headquarters was established by the Three-Man Group for the purpose of supervising and implementing the ceasefire, demobilization, and reorganization of Chinese armed forces on the ground. Since the United States has decided to terminate its association with the Three-Man Executive Group and the Executive Headquarters, the Marines assigned to protect the Executive Headquarters will naturally be relieved of their duties and withdrawn. Subsequently, approximately 3,000 armed forces personnel will remain in China. One to two thousand Marines will remain in Qingdao, a city on the North China coast facing the US-occupied area of Korea. In addition, 750 officers and soldiers will remain in Nanjing to train Chinese personnel at military academies. The remaining US military personnel will be stationed in various locations to protect and dispose of remaining US supplies. The US Export-Import Bank's $500 million fund will continue to be used for loans to China. It is generally pointed out that once the situation in China changes and a sound economic plan can be implemented, China can draw upon this fund."

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping on the 30th: The spokesman for the highest US authority in the Military Mediation Department stated to reporters on the afternoon of the 30th: "Along with the withdrawal of US personnel, the US military observer group in Yan'an and the liaison group in Harbin have also decided to be abolished."

　　美国务院官员宣称
    驻华美军将部分撤退
    但还要留三千名占据青岛助蒋练兵海空军等是否撤离也没有明确表示延安观察组哈尔滨联络小组亦撤销
    【新华社延安一日电】据美联社华盛顿二十九日电：美国务院新闻官员麦克德茂今日（即二十九日）宣称：“与美方退出执行部之计划相合，撤出美国驻华海军陆战队之指示不久即将颁发。”据美新闻处华盛顿三十日电：“驻华美军或将有不少被召回。”“但美国武装部队人员将剩有三千人左右，陆战队一、二千名将留在青岛。”（按：中国人民一贯要求为所有驻华美军全部撤离中国，但美国务院官员之声明，对于驻华美海军空军及军事顾问团等是否撤离中国，并无明确表示。即据美新闻处消息，则将来至少仍有美国武装部队人员三千人左右继续留驻中国，此仍属侵害中国主权，并违反中国人民之愿望。）
    【新华社延安一日电】华盛顿三十日电称：“关于星期三美国宣布决定终止对三人小组之关系一节，一般认为驻华美军或将有不少被召回。目下在华之美国海陆军及陆战队人员一万二千名，内有九百名以上为陆战队，其中大半被派为支持北平之执行总部。该执行总部系三人小组所设立，其目的在于就地监督并执行中国武装部队之停战、复员与改编。美国既已决定终止对三人执行小组及执行总部之关连，则被派保护执行总部之陆战队自将卸职撤退。此后，留在中国之武装部队人员将剩下有三千人左右。陆战队一二千名将留在青岛，此处为华北沿海之城市，面对朝鲜美国占领区。此外，军官与士兵七百五十名将留在南京，从事训练军校之中国人员。其余美军人员则驻在各地，以便保护及处置美国之剩余物资。美进出口行五亿美元之基金，将继续作为对华贷款之用。一般指出：一俟中国局势改变，而能实行健全之经济计划时，中国即可提用此项基金。”
    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社北平三十日电：军调部美方最高当局发言人三十日下午对记者发表谈话中称：“随美方人员之撤退，在延安之美军观察组及哈尔滨之联络小组亦决定撤销。”
