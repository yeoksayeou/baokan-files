　　Taiyue Field Hospital No. 2
    Carrying Stretchers, Building Stoves, Making Beds
    Saving 178 Units of Civilian Labor Twice
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] The staff of Taiyue Field Hospital No. 2 saved 178 units of civilian labor on two occasions. The first time, when transferring the wounded and sick from Gedui, Anze to Shidu, they organized six stretchers themselves, led by Instructor Wang (who also carried one himself). They climbed mountains and crossed ridges, traveling over 80 li, taking two days to reach their destination. Their morale was very high along the way, and the comrades did not feel tired. The people along the way said, "The Eighth Route Army cherishes the people, and the cadres even carry the wounded soldiers themselves." The second time, when they moved to Duan's ×××, to construct hospital ward kitchens, Director Wang, Political Instructor Wang, and all the staff of the hospital personally took action, some carrying bricks, others carrying water and earth, and others laying floorboards. They worked intensely for three days, making 150 beds and repairing the stoves in two kitchens, saving 120 units of civilian labor.

　　太岳野战卫生二所
    自己抬担架、修灶、做病床
    两次节约民力一百八
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳野战卫生二所工作人员，两次节约民力一百七十八个。他们第一次由安泽圪堆往石渡转运伤病员时，自己组织了六付担架，由王指导员带领（他自己也抬）。爬山越岭，经过了八十余里，走了两天才到目的地。沿途情绪很高，同志们都不觉疲倦。沿途老百姓说：“八路军就是爱惜老百姓，干部还自己抬伤兵。”第二次他们转移到端氏×××时，建设病房厨房，王所长王政指及全所工作人员亲自动手，你抬砖，我担水挑土，他放铺板。紧张地工作了三天，就做成了一百五十个病床，修好了两个厨房的锅灶，节省了民力一百二十个。
