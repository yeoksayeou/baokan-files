　　[This paper, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 25th report] According to people who escaped from the Chiang-occupied area of Fengxian County to the liberated area: After the 88th Division of the Chiang army was largely wiped out by the Eighth Route Army in Jinxiang, Yutai, and Shanxian counties, Fang Xianjue repeatedly requested the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to replenish new recruits. The Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters then ordered all counties to forcibly conscript young men, with Fengxian County alone required to provide more than 2,500 men. Eight hundred men have already been conscripted, with each bao required to provide eight men. Even Huizhuang, a small village of eighteen households west of the city, had to provide eight men, and the county, district, and bao chiefs were strictly ordered to be executed if they failed to complete this task. Bao chiefs fled in droves to avoid this. In Zhangxi District alone, more than thirty bao chiefs fled. They also advised the people, saying, "Those who were captured before, their fate is still unknown. If you are captured again this time, there is probably little chance of survival. You should all hide!" As a result, the people there fled to the liberated areas en masse. Seeing that the conscription plan had failed, the Chiang family's district and township offices then surrounded market towns everywhere to seize recruits, but most of those captured were the old and weak. The conscription efforts all failed. The Chiang army has now announced a postponement to deceive the people into returning home, taking the opportunity to conscript again. But the people know their tricks and no one has returned home. Now there are very few young and middle-aged men to be seen in the Chiang-occupied area of Fengxian County. (Jun Qian)
　　[This paper, Taihang, 24th report] (Delayed) The Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 49th Division of the Yan Army, stationed in Dianyu and Baiziyu southeast of Shouyang, on the 12th, the 9th Company of the battalion sent 42 men to Yuzui to loot grain and seize recruits. Our Shouyang Independent Battalion, upon hearing the news, rushed to the village and surrounded the enemy regiment. After forty minutes of fierce fighting, 23 enemies were killed or wounded, and 11 were captured. Only the enemy company commander and eight soldiers escaped. We captured three light machine guns, two small cannons, one grenade launcher, and twelve rifles. We suffered two minor injuries.
　　Further report: On the night of the 10th, our unit penetrated deep into the enemy's rear in Huixian County and liberated Wangcunpu east of the city. Four soldiers of the newly formed 85th Army (puppet Li Ying's unit) of the Chiang army were killed, and twenty-five soldiers including the platoon leader were captured. We seized one light machine gun and twenty-five rifles.

　　丰县蒋军勒令抽丁保长出走青壮逃亡
    寿阳独立营痛歼抓丁阎军
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】据由丰县蒋占区逃到解放区之来人谈：蒋军八十八师自在金（乡）鱼（台）单（县）等县为八路军消灭大部后，方先觉一再请求徐州绥署补充新兵。徐州绥署即勒令各县强抽壮丁，只丰县就要两千五百人以上。已抽抓八百人，每保要八人。城西惠庄虽是十八户的小村，也要出八名，并严令县区保长不能完成此次任务者，均处死刑。保长纷纷逃亡躲避。只丈西一个区，即逃亡保长三十余人。他们并劝告民众们说：“以前抓去的，到现在还不知死活，这回再抽抓去，大约是活路不多，你们也都躲躲吧！”因之该地民众均相率逃来解放区，蒋家区乡公所见抽丁计划失败，遂又到处包围集市抓丁，但所抓到的多数是老弱。抽抓均告失败后，蒋军现又宣布缓期，以欺骗民众回家，乘机再抽再抓。但民众已知其鬼计，没有一个人回家。现在丰县蒋占区已很少见到青壮年。（君谦）
    【本报太行二十四日电】（迟到）盘寿阳东南之颠峪、柏子峪阎军四十九师二团三营，十二日该营九连派出四十二人到鱼咀抢粮抓丁，我寿阳独立营闻讯赶至，当蒋阎伪团团包围于该村，经四十分钟激战，毙伤敌二十三名，俘十一名，仅敌连长与八名士兵逃走。我缴获轻机枪三挺，小炮两门，掷弹筒一个，步枪十二支。我轻伤二人。
    又电：十日夜，我×部深入辉县敌后，解放城东之王村铺。击毙蒋军新编八十五军（伪李英部）四名，俘排长以下二十五名，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪二十五支。
