[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] General Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, recently reported to the Border Region Government on military work in the seven-month self-defense war. General Teng stated: Chiang Kai-shek, determined to implement his policy of selling out the country, launching a dictatorial civil war, completely violated the ceasefire orders and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in July of last year, launching a large-scale civil war offensive against all liberated areas. After mid-July, our region was entirely in a state of war. Chiang's troops invaded our region along the Longhai, Tongpu, and Pinghan (including the Daoqing line) three fronts, with a total force of over fifty brigades, successively occupying thirty-nine county towns in our territory. Simultaneously with the military offensive, they also intensified the return of the Yellow River to its old course, diverting the Yellow River to divide our liberated areas. Under the pressure of a large army, we implemented the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's strategy of concentrating superior forces, making large-scale advances and retreats, not caring about the gains or losses of one city or one place, annihilating the enemy's living forces one by one through mobile warfare, and boldly mobilizing the masses, persisting in the struggle in the occupied areas, and defending the fruits of struggle through guerrilla warfare. At the same time, we made every effort to carry out land reform and mobilize the masses. On this basis, we organized the strength of the entire people to carry out the self-defense war and fully support the front lines. General Teng stated: We resolutely implemented the above-mentioned policies, made a general and urgent mobilization throughout the region, and since November of last year, the war situation has begun to change drastically. The field army has continuously annihilated a large number of enemies in mobile warfare, and guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas has already begun. The enemy's forces are even more insufficient, the front lines are vast, and they are forced to disperse most of their forces for defense. At this point, we began a partial active offensive, crushing Chiang Kai-shek's plan to open up the Pinghan line. Now our army has advanced to the Longhai line and its southern areas, recovering more than one-half of the lost territory. Our army has taken the initiative along the Jilu Yu and Pinghan lines. Although the Jiang-Yan forces on the Tongpu line once broke through, our army successively recovered Lingshi and Xiaoyi and cut it off again. General Teng praised the significant contributions of the military region's armed forces and militia, saying: Local armed forces and militia annihilated 50,000 enemies in half a year, with a ratio of five to six compared to the annihilation of enemies by the field army. In the past two months, the war situation in our region has undergone tremendous changes, and the confidence in victory among the soldiers and civilians throughout the region has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and the unanimous effort of the entire people is increasingly moving towards a full-scale counter-offensive.

General Teng used figures to illustrate the achievements of the self-defense war from July to December 20th of last year. A total of more than two thousand six hundred and fifty large and small battles were fought, annihilating sixteen brigades of Chiang's regular army, and, including miscellaneous, stubborn, and puppet troops, killing or wounding 44,189 officers and soldiers below the division commander level, and capturing more than 60,000, including Division Commander Zhao Xitian. Eighteen county towns were captured. Eighteen tanks, thirty-seven mountain guns, eight howitzers, and more than a thousand various other artillery pieces, more than two thousand seven hundred light and heavy machine guns, and more than thirty-seven thousand submachine guns, hand-held machine guns, and rifles and carbines were seized. In half a year, militia combat, based on incomplete statistics from the Taihang and Taiyue areas alone, involved more than ten thousand battles, with 200,000 militia participating. More than 11,000 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, and more than thirty light machine guns, one thousand seven hundred rifles and carbines, and mortars and rocket launchers were seized. Achievements in January of this year: Nineteen county towns were captured and recovered. Fifteen and a half regiments of Jiang-Yan regular troops were annihilated, killing or wounding more than nine thousand seven hundred Chiang's troops, and capturing 24,800 officers and soldiers below the level of Xie Maoquan, brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division of Chiang's army, and Wang Ximing, deputy division commander of the 69th Division of Yan's army. The annihilation of puppet local troops and county government personnel is estimated at: more than five thousand six hundred killed or wounded, and twenty-one thousand seven hundred officers and soldiers below the level of Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the 3rd Security Column of the Puppet National Defense Ministry, captured. The above totals 61,274 annihilated Chiang's troops, twenty-two mountain guns, eighty-six mortars, three hundred and forty-four small cannons, one thousand two hundred and ninety light and heavy machine guns, nineteen thousand four hundred rifles and carbines, and more than five hundred thousand rounds of various bullets were seized. Adding the seven county towns recovered in February, the actual number of county towns recovered at the beginning of this year is twenty-six.

Speaking of the military construction work of the past seven months, General Teng said: 1. We have built the field armies of the various military regions. Each military region has formed a field army group, undertaking the task of independently annihilating the enemy, persisting in border area struggles, and cooperating with the main forces in combat. The combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. 2. The Yuwan Su Military Region has been established, and the struggle in the vast areas south of the Longhai Road, east of the Pinghan Road, west of the Jinpu Road, and north of the New Yellow River has been persisted in. The situation in the region is now developing vigorously. 3. The organization has been generally reorganized, rear organs have been streamlined, combat troops have been replenished, various systems have been strictly enforced and reorganized, and strict discipline has been established. 4. The new work style of the mass line in the troops has been widely developed. This line has been adopted in combat training and political work, with great results. A new heroism and the Wang Keqin movement are now being widely developed. There has also been great progress in the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people. The phenomenon of violating mass discipline has been largely overcome after strict handling and in-depth education. There has also been progress in the work of prisoners of war. Since July, 50,000 soldiers liberated from Chiang's army have been absorbed into the army. They have made many contributions in combat and training. But there is a prerequisite, that they must be strictly reformed to be integrated with the people. 5. A large number of cadres have been trained, and new recruit replenishment regiments have been generally established to ensure war needs.

General Teng especially mentioned the work of the rear areas supporting the front lines, "Truly reaching the scale of a war of the whole people." The greatest thing is that on the basis of land reform, 100,000 new soldiers have been mobilized to replenish the field armies and military region troops. Governments at all levels and the people have participated in war support work with the greatest effort. In particular, in Jilu Yu, the war is the most frequent and the mobilization of civilian labor is the greatest, but their work is generally done well. The wounded are well cared for, reducing the death of the wounded, and ammunition transport is generally also very rapid. Government agencies at all levels are generally able to save on food and clothing to support the war. Military industrial production has greatly improved in the past six months. Taking the production in May of last year as the standard, it has now increased by one time.

General Teng summarized the basic experience of the seven-month self-defense war, saying: First, we must overcome peaceful illusions, resolutely carry out the patriotic self-defense war, and organize the strength of the entire people to strive for the victory of the self-defense war. Second, we must unite a considerable number of troops, adopt the strategy of expanding maneuverability, making large-scale advances and retreats, concentrating superior forces, and seeking out the enemy's weaknesses, focusing on annihilating the enemy's living forces one by one in mobile warfare, and implementing the principle of primarily relying on mobile warfare. Implement the principle of resolutely not fighting attrition warfare or battles without certainty of victory. Third, we must resolutely adopt the guerrilla warfare strategy of advancing when the enemy retreats and advancing even when the enemy does not advance, persisting in the struggle in the occupied areas. Rely closely on the people, boldly mobilize the masses, and arm the masses to rise up to defend the fruits of struggle, defend life and production, and fight against "counter-settlements." Fourth, we must mobilize the strength of the entire people. The front focuses on fighting, and the rear focuses on supporting the front lines, doing a good job in land reform, production, finance, and economy, etc. ... a whole set of work, the war will certainly be won. Fifth, we must resolutely promote land reform and conduct in-depth current affairs education in order to mobilize the people of the whole region's high enthusiasm for the patriotic self-defense war.

General Teng estimated the future war situation, pointing out: Chiang's army's living forces have been largely annihilated, and the troop strength is seriously insufficient. In the vast majority of the occupied areas in this region, the defenses are very weak and may be attacked and annihilated by us at any time. We have taken the initiative in most areas. In addition, Chiang's army has concentrated its forces to defend the Longhai line, and the possibility of launching a strategic offensive against us simultaneously in several regions has been greatly reduced. Our army is launching a counter-offensive in many areas (such as recently in the areas north and south of the Longhai line). This offensive will continue to unfold vigorously, and will continue to recover lost territory and liberate new areas. However, General Teng said: It is not that the entire region has stopped Chiang's army's offensive and started our counter-offensive. Today, Chiang Kai-shek may still launch a strategic offensive against southern Shandong. This is a decisive battle in which Chiang Kai-shek concentrates his greatest strength after suffering continuous defeats, a desperate gamble. Only by crushing this offensive or giving it one or two more decisive blows, annihilating a certain number of its living forces, can Chiang's army's strategic offensive be stopped. Our army will also invest in this battle to coordinate the self-defense war in the Shandong Liberated Area. In addition, Chiang's army's operational offensives against our region, such as conducting encirclement and suppression sweeps in some areas, will continue constantly, which must be guarded against. General Teng said: No matter how Chiang Kai-shek struggles, the period of full-scale counter-offensive is approaching. As long as we annihilate forty or fifty more brigades, we can enter the counter-offensive in four or five months. We must make full preparations ideologically, organizationally, and materially.

General Teng pointed out that the central task of future struggles is to strive for the victory of the war with all our strength and to step up preparations for the counter-offensive. Not to conserve strength, but to take out all our strength. Scientifically, precisely, and planned mobilize manpower and material resources to the front line to strive for the victory of the counter-offensive, recover lost territory, and expand the liberated areas. To this end, we must: 1. Strengthen combat and strengthen troop training to improve the combat effectiveness of the main force and the military region troops, and continue to annihilate a large number of enemies. 2. Persist in developing guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, carry out guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-controlled areas, and cooperate with the counter-offensive. 3. Ensure a continuous supply of soldiers and cadres, replenish combat formations, and form new corps. In addition to training and cultivating within the army itself, we should also mobilize a large number of local cadres and young students to join the army. 4. Strengthen war support work and military industrial production, and properly settle honorary soldiers. 5. Strengthen the work in the recovered areas and vigorously mobilize the masses to support the front lines. 6. Vigorously implement production and economy, reduce the burden on the people, and ensure the combat strength necessary to support a long-term war and maintain the counter-offensive.

　　滕副司令员向边府委员会报告
    七个月自卫战争中的军事工作
    【本报特讯】军区副司令员滕代远将军，日前向边府委员会报告七个月来自卫战争中的军事工作。滕将军称：蒋介石决心贯彻其卖国内战独裁的政策，于去年七月完全破坏停战命令和政协决议，向全国各解放区发动大规模内战进攻。七月中旬以后，我区即全部处于战争状态。蒋军沿陇海、同蒲、平汉（包括道清线）三条战线侵入我区，总兵力达五十个旅以上，先后陷占我三十九座县城。与军事进攻同时，并加紧进行黄河归故，引黄水以割裂我解放区。在大军压境之下，我们执行了中共中央集中优势兵力、大踏步进退、不计一城一地得失、各个歼敌有生力量的运动战和放手发动群众、坚持沦陷区斗争、保卫斗争果实的游击战争方针，同时又以全力进行土地改革，发动群众。在这一基础上组织全民力量，进行自卫战争，全力支援前线。滕将军称：我们坚决执行上述方针，在全区作了普遍而紧急的动员，从去年十一月份以后，战局开始激烈变化，野战军连续在运动中歼灭大量敌人，沦陷区游击战争已经展开。敌兵力更加不足，战线辽阔，被迫以大部兵力分散进行守备。至此我们即开始了局部的主动出击，粉碎蒋介石打通平汉的计划。现我军已进至陇海线及其以南地区，收复失地二分之一以上。我军在冀鲁豫、平汉沿线已掌握主动。同蒲线蒋阎军虽曾一度打通，但我军先后收复灵石、孝义，又将其切断。滕将军赞扬军区武装与民兵的重大贡献，他说：地方武装与民兵半年歼敌五万，与野战军歼敌比例为五与六之比。两个月来，本区战局已有了巨大变化，全区军民胜利信念空前提高，全民一致日益走向全面反攻。
    滕将军以数字说明去年七月至十二月二十日的自卫战绩。计大小战斗二千六百五十余次，歼蒋正规军十六个旅，连杂顽伪军共毙伤师长以下四万四千一百八十九人，俘师长赵锡田以下六万余人。攻克县城十八座。缴坦克十八辆，山炮三十七门，榴弹炮八门以下各种炮千余门，轻重机枪二千七百余挺，冲锋机枪、手提机枪及步马枪三万七千余支。半年中，民兵战斗仅太行、太岳两区不完全统计，共作战万余次，参战民兵二十万。毙伤俘敌一万一千余人，缴轻机枪三十余挺，步马枪一千七百余支及迫击炮、火箭炮等。今年一月份战绩：攻克与收复县城十九座。歼蒋阎正规军十五个半团，毙伤蒋军九千七百余人，俘蒋七十师一四○旅旅长谢懋权、阎军六十九师副师长王熙明以下官兵两万四千八百人；歼伪地方团队及县政府人员计：毙伤五千六百余人，俘伪国防部保安第三纵队司令张岚峰以下官兵两万一千七百余人。以上共计歼蒋军六万一千二百七十四人，缴山炮二十二门，迫击炮八十六门，小炮三百四十四门，轻重机枪一千二百九十挺，步马枪一万九千四百余枝，各种子弹五十余万发。如加上二月收复县城七座，则今年初实已收复县城二十六座。
    谈到七个月来的建军工作，滕将军称：一、建设了各军区的野战军，每个军区均已组成野战集团，担负起独力歼敌、坚持边沿斗争、配合主力作战的任务，战斗力已大为提高。二、建立了豫皖苏军区、坚持了陇海路南、平汉路东、津浦路西、新黄河以北广大地区的斗争，现该区局面正猛烈发展。三、普遍整理了组织，紧缩后方机关，充实战斗部队，严格和整理了各种制度，建立了严肃的纪律。四、部队中群众路线的新作风已普遍开展。无论作战练兵政治工作均采取这种路线，收效极大，现正普遍开展新英雄主义和王克勤运动。对拥政爱民工作亦有很大进步，破坏群众纪律现象经严格处置和深入教育后已大为克服。俘虏工作亦有进步。七月以来已吸收五万纵蒋军中解放的战士入伍，他们在战斗与训练中均已贡献不少成绩。但有一个先决条件，即必须予以严格改造使与人民结合。五、培养了大批干部，普遍成立了新兵补充团，保证战争需要。
    滕将军特别提及后方支援前线工作，“真正达到了全民战争的规模。”最伟大的是在土地改革的基础上动员了十万新战士补充各野战军及军区部队。各级政府和人民均以最大的力量参加战勤工作。特别是冀鲁豫，战争最频繁、民力动员最大，但他们工作一般作得很好。对伤员照顾很好，减少了伤员死亡，在弹药运输上一般也很迅速。各级政权机构一般均能节衣缩食支援战争。军工生产半年来有很大提高，如以去年五月生产为标准，现在已增加一倍。
    滕将军总结七个月自卫战争的基本经验称：第一、必须克服和平幻想，坚决进行爱国自卫战争，组织全民力量争取自卫战争的胜利。第二、必须团结相当数量兵力，采取扩大机动大踏步进退、集中优势兵力、辗转寻找敌人弱点，要把握的在运动中各个歼灭敌人有生力量，实行以运动战为主的作战方针。实行坚决不打消耗战与无把握的仗的原则。第三、必须坚决采取敌退我进，敌不进我亦进的坚持沦陷的斗争的游击战方针。紧紧依靠人民，放手发动群众，武装群众自己起来为保卫斗争果实，保卫生命生产反“倒算”而斗争。第四、必须发动全民力量，前方努力打仗，后方尽力支援前线，搞好土地改革、生产及财政经济……等一整套工作，战争一定能胜利。第五、必须坚决推行土地改革，进行深入的时事教育，才能发动全区人民爱国自卫战争的高度热情。
    滕将军估计今后战局时指出：蒋军有生力量大量被歼，兵力严重不足，在本区绝大多数沦陷区的守备已非常薄弱，随时有遭我打击歼灭可能，我们在大多地区掌握了主动。加以蒋军又集中兵力守卫陇海，其在几个地区同时对我发动战略性进攻的可能已大为减少。我军在许多地区则正在发动反攻，（如最近在陇海南北地区）这一攻势仍将猛烈展开，并将继续收复失地和解放新的地区。但是，滕将军说：并不是整个地区已停止了蒋军的进攻和开始了我们的反攻，今天蒋介石还可能向鲁南作战略性的进攻，这是蒋介石遭受连续失败后集中其最大力量带有孤注一掷性的决战，只有粉碎了这一进攻或再给以一两个决定性的打击，歼灭其一定数量的有生力量，才能停止蒋军的战略进攻。我军亦将同时投入这一作战以策应山东解放区的自卫战争。此外蒋军对我区战役进攻是在某些地区进行清剿扫荡则将继续不断，这是必须警惕到的。滕将军说：不管蒋介石如何挣扎，全面反攻的时期已逼近了，只要再歼灭它四五十个旅，我们即可在四五个月内进入反攻。我们必须从思想上组织上物质上作充分的准备。
    滕将军指出今后斗争的中心任务是全力争取战争的胜利和加紧准备反攻。不是保守力量，而是拿出我们一切力量。科学的精确计划的动员人力物力到前线上去，争取反攻胜利，收复失地，扩大解放区。为此，必须：一、加强作战、加强部队的训练，提高主力军及军区部队战斗力，继续大量歼灭敌人。二、坚持发展沦陷区游击战争，开展蒋管区游击战争，配合反攻。三、保证兵员和干部源源不断得到补充，充实战斗兵团，组成新的兵团。干部补充除军队本身训练培养外，还应动员大批地方干部和青年学生参军。四、加强战勤工作和军工生产，妥为安插荣誉军人。五、加强收复区工作，猛烈发动群众支援前线。六、厉行生产节约，减轻人民负担，保证支持长期战争和保持反攻所必须的战斗力量。
