　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch】 After hearing the news that Chiang Kai-shek bombed and released water, flooding the liberated areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the peasants who had overthrown landlords in various places rose up to protest and launched a donation campaign to help the disaster. At the celebration of the overthrow of landlords attended by 30,000 farmers in Bao Liu County, a telegram was sent to express sympathy to the disaster victims. The telegram stated: "Your disaster is our disaster, and we vow to be your backing." The conference passed a resolution to launch a donation campaign throughout the county to donate money and materials to help the brothers and sisters in the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Changzi County also launched a "one dollar movement" to help the disaster victims in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan.
