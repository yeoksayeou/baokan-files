　　Xiajin Turnover Team
    Responsible Cadres Take the Lead as Role Models
    [This newspaper's report from Jinnan, 26th] In order to powerfully promote the return of over-extracted and cheaply bought fruits, the responsible cadres of the Xiajin Turnover Team of the District Party Committee took the lead as role models. A meeting was convened at the brigade headquarters a few days ago. In addition to focusing on strict self-criticism of the leadership's ideology and the mass viewpoint and position, special regulations were made regarding the methods and procedures for returning fruits: 1. Responsible cadres of the turnover team must take the lead in returning all cheaply bought fruits, and mobilize general cadres to clear their thinking and consciously return the cheaply bought fruits. 2. The deadline for returning is March 10th for cadres of the District Party Committee and directly affiliated organs, and can be extended to the end of April for cadres who have been transferred. 3. For return procedures, before returning the items, write "Received by so-and-so from such-and-such village in such-and-such district of Xiajin, price in silver dollars (according to the purchase price at the time)." Currently, this work of returning fruits is progressing rapidly.
