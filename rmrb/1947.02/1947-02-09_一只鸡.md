    A Chicken

    Anecdotes of General Zuo Quan
    In the summer of 1942, the enemy launched a treacherous "raid" on the Jin-Dong Headquarters. At that time, Chief of Staff Zuo led a part of the troops and cadres from the Party School to fight a guerrilla war; the fighting was exceptionally brutal, and they could not get proper sleep and rest for several days and nights. Because the villagers had "fortified" all the grain, persimmon flour (persimmons ground into flour, which ordinary and poor farmers in southeastern Shanxi used as food) became everyone's only sustenance, causing everyone to have difficulty with bowel movements. Although Chief of Staff Zuo was even more hardworking and concerned than others (as soon as the troops stopped, he would open the map, study the enemy situation, and deploy the battle), he was no exception when it came to eating persimmon flour.
    One day, the troops moved to a small village, and the orderly carried a pot into the Chief of Staff's room.
    "What's that?" the Chief of Staff asked, a fragrant smell entering his nostrils.
    "Chicken, chicken soup cooked for you. You've barely eaten these past few days..."
    "Where did the chicken come from?!... Bought it? The people have all fled, where would there be chickens for sale?" the Chief of Staff interrupted the orderly.
    The orderly said, "I left enough money in the chicken coop to buy two chickens..."
    The Chief of Staff frowned. He didn't speak, nor did he eat the chicken. A cadre nearby said:
    "It's already cooked, shouldn't you eat it? For your health..."
    Before he could finish, the Chief of Staff pointed to the chicken in the pot and said to the orderly:
    "Take it, take it to the village entrance and wait there. When wounded soldiers come, divide it among them to eat!"…

    一只鸡
    项军
    左权将军轶事
    一九四二年夏天，敌人对晋东司令部进行了一次阴谋的“奔袭”。当时左参谋长带领一部分队伍和党校的干部，与敌人打游击；战斗是异常残酷的，一连几昼夜都不能好好的睡眠和休息。因为老乡把粮食都“坚壁”起来了，所以柿子面（用柿子磨面，晋东南一般中贫农作为粮食）就成了大家唯一的食粮，吃的大家都拉不下屎来。左参谋长虽然比别人更加辛苦、操劳，（队伍一停下来，他就打开地图，研究着敌情，部署着战斗）但吃柿子面也不例外。
    一天，部队转移到一个小村，警卫员提着一个壶走进参谋长的房子。
    “那是什么？”参谋长问，一股很香的味道钻进他的鼻孔。
    “鸡，给你煮的鸡。这几天你很少吃……”
    “那来的鸡呀？！……买的？老百姓都跑了，那里还有卖鸡的？”参谋长打断了警卫员的话，这样问。
    警卫员说：“我在鸡笼里放了足够买两只鸡的钱……”
    参谋长皱起了眉头。不说话，也不吃鸡，旁边一个干部说：
    “已经作熟了，还是吃了吧？你的健康……”
    没等他说完，参谋长指着壶里的鸡，对警卫员说：
    “去，把他拿到村口上去等着，一会有伤兵过来时，给他们分着吃了！”…
