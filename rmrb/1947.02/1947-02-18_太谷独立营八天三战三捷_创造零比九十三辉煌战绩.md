　　Taigu Independent Battalion Achieves Three Victories in Eight Days
    Creating a Brilliant Record of Zero Casualties Against Ninety-Three Enemy Losses
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Taihang, 16th] The Taigu Independent Battalion achieved three victories in three battles within eight days, from January 30th to February 6th, creating a brilliant record of zero casualties against ninety-three enemy losses. It was commended by the leaders of the Taihang Second Military Subdistrict in a circular, hailed as the "banner of guerrilla warfare in central Shanxi," and rewarded with 20,000 yuan in foreign currency. On January 30th, enemy special agents of the "Qinwu Revenge Team" attacked our Liangcun. The battalion pursued and engaged them near Nantuanbai, killing thirteen enemy soldiers. On the 4th, the battalion coordinated with the Jinan Campaign, and together with a unit of the Qixian Sixth Company, actively attacked Baitown in Taigu, annihilating the Third Company of the enemy police brigade. Over one hundred and eighty enemy soldiers from Bei＠cun came to reinforce them, and a part of the battalion immediately outflanked the enemy, resolving the battle within half an hour, killing and wounding twelve enemy soldiers, capturing twenty-three, and seizing two light machine guns, twelve rifles, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. On the night of the 5th, the entire battalion penetrated deep behind enemy lines to Siguacun; on the 6th, the Eighth Company of Yan Xishan's puppet 23rd Security Regiment arrived at the village to seize grain and was ambushed by the battalion. With the exception of five who escaped, all were annihilated. More than twenty enemy soldiers, including a platoon leader, were killed or wounded, twenty-five were captured, and three machine guns, fifteen rifles, and over two thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. In the above three battles, we suffered no casualties. (Dong Ruqiang, Li Tuofu)
