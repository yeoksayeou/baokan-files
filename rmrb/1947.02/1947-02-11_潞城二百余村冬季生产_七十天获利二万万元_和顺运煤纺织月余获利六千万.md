[This article was] Transmitted by this newspaper from Lucheng. Lucheng recently summarized its winter production over seventy days. According to statistics from 213 villages, 137 cooperatives earned over 20,000,000 yuan in dividends; 148 villages organized transportation, earning 62,790,000 yuan. The entire county had 85 saltpeter furnaces, producing 130,000 jin of saltpeter, earning over 30,000,000 yuan. In 150 villages, over 17,000 women were engaged in weaving, earning over 30,000,000 yuan. The County United Cooperative earned 7,000,000 yuan from collecting and weaving straw hats in eighty days. Three hundred eighty-five small cooperatives in one hundred villages earned over 20,000,000 yuan.

The total profit from the above six items was over 200,000,000 yuan, equivalent to over 130,000 shi of grain. Based on a calculation of over 60,000 people in 122 villages, each person received an average of more than four shi of grain. Based on over 60,000 livestock participating in transportation, each animal received an average of more than twenty-two shi of grain, equivalent to over 30,000 yuan.

County Magistrate Zhao pointed out at the expanded cadre meeting, based on the seventy-day production situation, that future work should still focus on deepening mass mobilization, combined with continuing to fulfill production requirements, truly ensuring that no one person or livestock in the county is idle, developing small-scale weaving, and striving for the county's self-sufficiency in clothing in 1947.

[This article was] Transmitted by this newspaper from Heshun. Heshun, combined winter production with the anti-feudal movement. From the late eleventh month to the end of the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, in forty days, the area earned 60,000,000 yuan, averaging more than 700 yuan per person in the county. The production characteristics of the county are as follows: 1. The county is richest in coal reserves. The county government specially loaned 2,300,000 yuan to help the people open many new kilns. The County United Cooperative established four coal lines and four coal stations throughout the county. In Nuanyao Village, with over sixty households and only thirty-four donkeys, the County United Cooperative set up a small coal station in the village to transport and sell charcoal to the Mingshui Factory, earning one million yuan in forty days and buying twenty-four new donkeys. 2. Mafang had no winter production habits in the past. This winter, it also organized a large number of porter teams to transport and sell persimmon cakes and coal. 3. In the movement to eliminate feudalism, middle peasants initially feared struggle and did not produce. After the masses explained and the leadership provided guarantees, they all became involved in production. 4. Heshun does not produce cotton, so there is no weaving tradition. This winter, after the government called for action and the cooperatives bought cotton, more than 7,400 women (about one-third of the county) participated in weaving. In Ren Yuanhan Village, First District, five women from Zhang Sibao's family participated in weaving, starting with eight jin of cotton as capital, and have already provided new clothes for all twelve members of the family and sold twenty zhang of cloth.

    【本报和顺讯】和顺在扫封建运动中结合冬季生产，从阴历十一月下旬至十二月底四十天中，获利六千万元，按全县人口平均每人赚七百多元。全县生产特点有以下几点：一、全县藏煤最富，县府特贷款二百三十万帮助老百姓大量开设新窑。县联社在全县建立了四条煤线和四个煤站。暖窑村六十余户，只毛驴三十四头，县联社即在该村设一小煤站运销明水工厂的炭，四十天获利百万，新买毛驴二十四头。二、马坊向无冬季生产习惯，今冬也组织了大批扁担队，运卖柿饼煤炭等。三、扫除封建运动中，中农开始怕斗，不生产，经群众解释，领导上提出保证，都卷入生产。四、和顺不产花，故无纺织习惯，今冬经过政府号召，合作社买花，已有七千四百余名（约全县三分之一）妇女参加纺织，一区任园汉村张四保家五个妇女参加纺织，八斤花起本，已作到全家十二口换季，还卖布二十丈。（政治处通讯小组）
