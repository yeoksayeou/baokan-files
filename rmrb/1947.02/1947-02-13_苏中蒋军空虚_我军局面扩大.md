Xinhua News Agency, Central China, February 11th: The situation in Central Jiangsu (the area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Xinghua-Dongtai line) has undergone significant changes. This is the result of the struggle of the military and civilians in the liberated areas against the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the occupied areas. The basic characteristics of this major change are two-fold: (1) The strength of the Chiang Kai-shek troops is becoming increasingly depleted, and internal contradictions and panic are growing. Before the Yancheng campaign, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Central Jiangsu numbered more than ten brigades. Afterwards, this was reduced to eight brigades. The largest contingent of Chiang Kai-shek troops was transferred north to the Shandong battlefield. Currently, only about five brigades, approximately 35,000 men, remain in the two hundred and several dozen Chiang Kai-shek strongholds in Central Jiangsu. Moreover, the majority of these are new recruits (for example, new recruits account for 90% of the remnants of the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division), and their combat effectiveness has been greatly reduced. Although Wang Maogong, the Chiang-appointed chairman of Jiangsu Province, personally went to Rugao, Huangqiao, Taixing, and Taizhou to deploy so-called "comprehensive suppression," in the past month, the scope of his "suppression" has been limited to the areas on both sides of the Rugao-Huangqiao and Dingyan-Juegang lines, and its scale is also much smaller than before. The areas south of the Rugao-Huangqiao and Taixing-Huangqiao lines were recovered by the local military and civilians within a few days. After the Xiguan, Xiaohai, and Xizha strongholds were removed in the Dongtai area, the Chiang Kai-shek troops have been unable to carry out "suppression" to this day. The military and civilians in Xinghua, Baoying, Qintong, Gaoyou and other places have reported frequent victories, successively recovering Wangdaqiao, Zhongguan and other strongholds and vast areas. As the defeat becomes increasingly apparent, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are intensifying their oppression of "security teams" and "home returning corps." For example, when the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Dongtai led its troops to harass, they were forced to drive the Dongtai security team as a shield. The 49th Division forced new recruits to serve as sentries. (2) Due to the increasing strength of the military and civilians in Central Jiangsu, they are launching successful attacks everywhere, and have entered a stage of large-scale liberation from small-scale resistance. In recent months, they have continuously shattered the Chiang Kai-shek troops' repeated "suppression" campaigns, and have been able to annihilate large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek troops. For example, in the victory of Shen Yanzhi in Dongtai on the first of this month, more than 400 enemies were wiped out in one fell swoop. During the same period, 25 Chiang Kai-shek strongholds of various sizes were removed, and vast rural areas were restored, allowing certain divided liberated areas to be connected and expanded, while the Chiang Kai-shek troops were compressed into a small number of strongholds.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, February 11th: The local armed forces in Xinghua, Central Jiangsu, annihilated more than 240 enemies in three days. At midnight on the 2nd, a unit of a certain regiment penetrated into Jiazhuang Village (more than ten miles southeast of Linze) on the Linze-Xinghua line, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chiang Kai-shek Fourth District Squad for two hours, completely eliminating them. The Chiang Kai-shek self-defense team leader and more than 50 others were killed, wounded or captured, and more than 30 rifles were seized. The unit suffered only two deaths and four injuries. On the 4th, a unit of the Chiang Kai-shek naval forces in Xinghua, aboard two iron-clad boats, cooperated with the "home returning corps," totaling more than 400 men, to plunder Guojiazhuang. Our Dongxi Laoshe (more than thirty miles northeast of Xinghua) and local armed forces cut off their rear. After four hours of fierce fighting, more than 80 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "home returning corps" members were captured, more than 120 Chiang Kai-shek troops were killed, and three machine guns and 36 rifles were seized. We suffered only two deaths and three injuries.

### 苏中蒋军空虚  我军局面扩大

    苏中蒋军空虚
    我军局面扩大
    【新华社华中十一日电】目前苏中（长江以北、兴化、东台一线以南地区）形势已发生重大变化，这是解放区军民在蒋军侵占区斗争的结果。形势大变化的基本特点有二：（一）蒋军兵力日益空虚，内部矛盾与恐慌日益滋长。盐城战役前，苏中蒋军兵力在十个旅以上，其后即减至八个旅，最大批蒋军北调鲁南战场，现在苏中二百几十个蒋军据点内所留仅约五个旅约三万五千人左右，且其中大部为新兵（如六十五师一八七旅残部新兵占百分之九十），战斗力已大大降低。蒋记苏省主席王懋功虽亲至如皋、黄桥、泰兴、泰州等地布置所谓“全面清剿”，但近一月来其“清剿”范围仅限于如（皋）黄（桥）、丁（堰）掘（港）等线两侧地区，其规模亦大不如前。如（皋）黄（桥）、泰（兴）黄（桥）线以南地区，不数日即为当地军民收复。东台地区被拔除西关、小海、西渣等据点后，蒋军“清剿”迄今无法进行。兴化、宝应、溱潼、高邮等地军民更捷讯频传，先后恢复王大桥、中关等据点及广大地区。在败局日益显露下，蒋军对其“保安队”“还乡团”等压迫愈甚，如东台蒋军六十五师一八七旅率部出扰时，必驱迫东台保安队为挡箭牌，四十九师则迫新兵为前哨。（二）由于苏中军民力量日益强大，到处胜利出击，已自小块坚持进入大块解放的局面。近月来不断粉碎了蒋军的多次“清剿”，且能大量歼灭蒋军，如本月一日东台沈燕之捷，一次歼敌四百余名，同时期内拔除蒋军大小据点二十五处，恢复广大乡村，使某些被分割的解放区得到联系与扩大，而蒋军则被压缩到少数据点内。
    【新华社华中十一日电】苏中兴化地方武装，三天内歼敌二百四十余名。二日午夜，某团一部挺入临（泽）兴（化）线上季家庄（临泽东南十余里），与蒋记四区区队激战二小时，将其全部解决，毙伤俘蒋记自卫队队长以下五十余人，缴步枪三十余支，该部仅伤四、亡二。四日，兴化蒋军水上部队一部，乘铁板船两艘配合“还乡团”共四百余名掳掠郭家庄，我东西老舍（兴化东北三十余里）及地方武装将其后路切断，经四小时激战，俘蒋军及“还乡团”八十余名，毙蒋军一百二十余名，缴机枪三挺，长短枪三十六支，自身仅伤三亡二。
