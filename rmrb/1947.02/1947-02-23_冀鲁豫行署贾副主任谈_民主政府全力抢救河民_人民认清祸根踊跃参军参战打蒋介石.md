[Jinji Luyu 20th Dispatch] On the 16th of this month, reporters from this newspaper visited residents along the Yellow River to express our condolences and interviewed Mr. Jia Xinzhai, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office. We received the following reply: Chiang Kai-shek's first diversion of the Yellow River flooded the people of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Now, in order to coordinate with his military offensive, he is restoring the Yellow River to its old course, which will flood the people of the Liberated Areas again. He is truly a great traitor who harms the country and the people. Therefore, when the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan heard the news of Chiang Kai-shek blocking the river mouth and releasing water, they reacted like a volcanic eruption, unanimously opposing it. At that time, throughout every village in the area, people were discussing nothing else. Old men and women were so worried that they went on hunger strikes and hanged themselves. After the Kaifeng meeting at the end of March last year, I (Mr. Jia referring to himself) accompanied the Kuomintang representatives to the Liberated Areas to inspect the Yellow River project. At a welcoming meeting, thousands of people complained and pleaded, and the whole audience cried. Some residents of the riverbed questioned the Kuomintang representatives on the spot, "Do you want the people or not?!" We inspected the coast of the Bohai Sea in Shandong, and the people complained wherever we went. Deputy Director Jia, who is over half a century old, spoke with a slightly pale face, took a breath, and continued his conversation: Not to mention the great harm that the people of more than 20 counties on both sides of the Yellow River will suffer, just considering the disasters suffered by the residents of the riverbed, according to the Central News Agency, only one-twentieth of the water has been released, and the river water is already three li wide and seven hundred li long. There are more than 270 new villages in the riverbed in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and more than 400 in the Bohai area. Assuming 50 households per village, more than 30,000 villages will be submerged! Deputy Director Jia explained: These lands were newly opened up by the residents of the riverbed, and the houses were newly built! With just one sentence from Chiang Kai-shek, these lives and properties are gone with the water! In the past, the masses had boats, fishing nets, and a set of ways and habits to maintain their lives. After the Yellow River changed its course for seven or eight years, the masses changed from fishing to farming. The flood suddenly struck, catching them off guard, their lives and property were no longer guaranteed, isn't it extremely natural for the people to fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death?

Deputy Director Jia changed his tone and said: The democratic government acts for the people. It held Kaifeng, Heze, and Nanjing agreements with the Kuomintang government one after another, but breaking promises and betraying faith is Chiang Kai-shek's nature, what is the use of agreements? He cannot change his determination to release water. The democratic government then coordinated with all the cadres of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and led thousands of people to stop all work—what work is more important than saving lives? In the scorching heat, in a month's time, 2.33 million people started working, repairing 1,400 li of dikes (total length on both sides). However, because the Kuomintang Executive Headquarters withheld the funds for the project, the dangerous sections have not been repaired, and the flood is still unavoidable. The people along the river fully realize that the flood cannot be saved unless Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. Therefore, they are organizing Yellow River self-rescue teams and actively joining the army and participating in the war.

　　冀鲁豫行署贾副主任谈
    民主政府全力抢救河民
    人民认清祸根踊跃参军参战打蒋介石
    【晋冀鲁豫二十日电】本月十六日记者代表本社慰问黄河沿岸居民，走访冀鲁豫行署副主任贾心斋先生，承蒙答复如下：蒋介石第一次黄河改道大水淹了豫皖苏的人民，现在为了配合他的军事进攻，重搞黄河归故，又要淹解放区人民，真是祸国殃民的大奸贼。所以冀鲁豫人民一听到蒋介石堵口放水的消息，像火山爆发一样，一致反对，当时走遍全区每个村庄，人民议论纷纷，没有第二个问题，老头老婆愁得绝食上吊，去年三月底开封会议之后，我（贾先生自称）偕同国民党代表到解放区来视察黄河工程，一个欢迎会上数千群众诉苦哀告，全场大哭，有的河床居民当场向国民党代表提出质问“要人民不要”？！我们视察到山东渤海边，沿路走到那里，人民控诉到那里。年逾半百的贾副主任，说得面色微微发黄，换一口气继续他的谈话道：黄河两岸二十余县人民将受多大危害，姑且不论，仅就河床居民所受灾难来说，据中央社消息才放水廿分之一，河水即有三里宽，七百里长。河床新村冀鲁豫有二百七十多个，渤海区有四百多个，按一村五十户计，淹没三万余村庄！贾副主任解释说：这些土地是河床居民新开辟的，房屋是新建筑的！蒋介石一句话，这些生命财产就付诸东流了啊！过去群众有船只，有鱼网，有一套维持生活的方式和习惯；黄河改道七八年来，群众一改打鱼生活而农耕，大水突然袭来，措手不及，生命财产失掉保障，人民要和蒋介石拚命不是极其自然的吗？
    贾副主任转过语调来说：民主政府为人民作主，与国民党政府先后举行开封、荷泽以及南京协议，但是出尔反尔，背信弃义是蒋介石的天性，协议有什么用处？放水的决心他是改变不了的。民主政府乃协同冀鲁豫全体干部率领千万人民，停止一切工作，——还有什么工作比救命更重要呢？——正当炎热的大气，一个月的工夫，动工二百三十三万人，修堤一千四百里（两岸共长）。但因国民党行总扣留工款，险工尚未修补，水患仍不可免。沿河人民完全认识到不打败蒋介石，黄水是救不了的。因此他们一面组织黄河自救队，一面踊跃参军参战。
