Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 7th. Although Chiang's army has gathered 20 to 30 brigades of troops in the Xuzhou-Hai Prefecture section of the Longhai Railway, and Chen Cheng, Zhou Zhirou, and Chiang Kai-shek himself have successively come to Xuzhou to supervise the battle, in the past ten days, because Chiang's army is very wary of the power of the People's Liberation Army, progress has been minimal. Since the central route of Chiang's army occupied Tancheng and Matou, about 50 kilometers south of Linyi, the Lunan campaign has become a stalemate. Military observers here believe that most of the officers and soldiers of Chiang's army have suffered serious lessons from the People's Liberation Army. In particular, the complete annihilation of the 26th Division and the First Rapid Column has dealt a greater blow to the morale of Chiang's army. This time, Chiang's army was driven to invade Lunan, and its officers and soldiers felt endangered, not knowing when it would be their turn to be unlucky. Some senior commanders believe that the Lunan decisive battle personally planned by Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng this time is an absurd adventure; if this battle fails, the entire Chiang army will fall into an irreparable situation, so the will to fight is unprecedentedly low. On the other hand, the People's Liberation Army has won successive battles, its morale is high, its equipment is superior, the people love it, and everyone is of one mind, all waiting to show their skills in this decisive battle. In addition, the People's Liberation Army on both sides of the Longhai Railway west of Xuzhou has also turned to counter-offensive and restored the vast liberated areas, which has given the Lunan defense battle a particularly important encouragement. Chiang's army is overwhelmed and embarrassed; therefore, the outcome of victory and defeat can be known without calculation.

    鲁南战事成相持状态
    蒋军官兵人人自危战志低落
    我军士气高昂咸抱胜利信心
    【新华社临沂七日电】蒋军虽在陇海路徐海段集结二三十个旅的大军，并由陈诚、周至柔、蒋介石等先后亲至徐州督战，但十日以来，因蒋军对人民解放军威力甚为戒惧，进展极微。自蒋军中路进占临沂南约五十公里的郯城、马头两地后，鲁南战役即成相持状态。此间军事观察家认为：蒋军大部官兵均受过人民解放军的严重教训，特别是二十六师、第一快速纵队的干净歼灭，对蒋军士气打击更大。此次蒋军被驱进犯鲁南，其官兵人人自危，不知何日轮到自己倒霉。若干高级指挥官认为蒋介石、陈诚此次所亲自策划的鲁南决战是一种荒唐的冒险；此战如果失败，则蒋军全局均将陷于不可收拾，故战志空前低落。反观人民解放军方面，则连战连胜，士气高涨，装备优越，民众爱戴，上下一心，均待于此次决战中大显身手。加以徐州以西陇海两侧人民解放军也转入反攻，恢复广大解放区，这给鲁南保卫战以尤为重大的鼓励。蒋军顾此失彼，窘态毕露；故胜败之数已可不计而知。
