[Report from the Jiluyu Frontline, this paper, 7th] During the operations on the Jinxiang Frontline, the 1036 Unit paid full attention to rectifying the mass discipline of the troops, enabling the support-the-people work to be closely integrated with the war. During the march, the 264th Unit specifically organized a discipline inspection team to carefully check the discipline of the troops, making timely criticisms and commendations. Because the leadership attached importance to maintaining discipline, a mass movement was created. The mutual aid group of the Seventh Squad of the 38th Unit worked out three measures: (1) Borrow things locally, with the principle of being close to their own garrison; (2) One class has three mutual aid groups, with specific division of labor for borrowing bowls, cleaning, and finding straw for bedding; (3) Issue "borrowing certificates" when borrowing things. Xu Xizhi, the head of the horse-driving class of the 223rd Unit, also paid attention to discipline. His class, which handled six or seven horses, never allowed them to nibble on a single tree. The Eighth Detachment of a certain unit of the 265th Unit helped the masses with their work every time they arrived at a place during the march south, warmly responding to the call of the Party Committee and the unit commander to "achieve merit in observing discipline." Fan Shilin, the company commander of the 36th Unit, took good care of the firewood and grass for the masses. Every time he arrived at a place to get grass for bedding, he carefully weighed it and instructed each squad not to burn grass for heating. Soldiers Liu Renhe and Chen Guoshuan were even more able to carry water and collect firewood for the masses every time they arrived at a place, which was well received by the masses. As the troops continued to advance into areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army, the entire army launched an investigation into the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek army. From the facts, everyone knew how much the masses longed for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army.

[Report from the Jiluyu Frontline, this paper, 6th] Comrade Wei Jiyu, the company commander of a certain front-line company, reported on his actions of loving the people under fire, saying: "The artillery fire was bombarding us, and five enemy planes were taking turns bombing and strafing our positions. The soldiers habitually entered the bunkers, monitoring the enemy in Jinxiang city. The incendiary bombs set the houses ablaze, and the entire Xiguan was shrouded in smoke. Many houses and grains were turned into ashes. How cruel the enemy is, disregarding the lives of the people! A shop owned by a family surnamed Han also caught fire, and smoke billowed from the doors and windows. Everything inside was about to be destroyed. Li Wenqing, the communication soldier, suggested to me: 'Let's move the things out, so the people can still use them in the future.' I naturally agreed with his suggestion. We put our guns in the courtyard, and the two of us went into the fire three times, turning us into ash men. However, two large boxes of cigarettes, a lunch box, quilts, clothes, etc., had already been piled up in the courtyard. In the afternoon, Li Wenqing and I went to inspect the work again. Three villagers were tying up their belongings, saying, 'I don't know which comrade was so kind, otherwise the things would have been gone long ago?' I told him that we had carried them out when the fire broke out, and he was so grateful that he didn't know what to say, just kept bowing to me. The next morning, two more villagers came back to move things, looking worried at the dilapidated courtyard. Dong Mou and I explained to him that the democratic government would find a solution after the war. He said, 'I know, the comrades risked the fire to help rescue things before the fighting was even over.'"

    金乡前线我军拥爱工作与战斗结合
    魏冀玉同志在炮火下给老乡抢救东西
    【本报冀鲁豫前线七日电】一○三六部队在金乡前线作战中以充分的注意力整顿了部队的群众纪律，使拥爱工作得以和战争紧密结合。在行军中二六四部队专门组织纪律检查大队，仔细检查部队纪律，及时批评表扬。由于领导上重视维护纪律，便造成群众运动，三八部队七小队互助组研究出三条办法：（１）分地方借东西，原则是靠近自己驻地。（２）一班三个互助组，具体分工、借碗、打扫卫生和找铺草。（３）借东西给“借物证”。二二三部马夫班长徐锡志也很注意纪律，他班招呼六七匹马从来没有啃过一棵树。二六五部队某部八分队在南下行军中，每到一地，就帮助群众干活，热烈响应了党委会和该部队长“在守纪律上立功”的号召。三六部队范士林连长替群众好好保护柴草，每到一地要铺草就仔细过秤，并嘱咐各班不能烧草烤火。战士刘仁和、陈国拴每到一地更能给群众担水拾柴，群众反映很好。部队继续前进进入蒋军侵占过的地区，全军上下一齐展开蒋军暴行调查，从事实里大家知道群众是怎么渴望人民解放军的来临。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】前线某连连长魏冀玉同志报导他在炮火下的爱民行动称：炮火在向我们轰击，五架敌机在我们阵地上空轮番轰炸、扫射。战士们习惯的进了地堡垒，监视着金乡城里的敌人。我和通讯员李文庆从前沿检查防务回来，燃烧弹打的房子都冒着熊熊的火，整个西关被烟笼罩住了，许多房屋粮食化成火灰。敌人是多么的残忍啊，竟这样不顾人民的死活！一家姓韩的店铺也着了火，烟从门窗中冒出来，眼看着里面的一切就要毁灭了。李文庆向我建议道：把东西给搬出来吧，以后老百姓还可以用。我当然的同意了他的意见。把枪放在院子里，我俩便向火中去了三次，使我俩成了灰人。可是两大箱纸烟，和提盒被子衣服等已经堆在院子里。下午我和李文庆又去检查工作，三个老乡正一面捆着东西，一面说：“这不知是那个同志多好心，要不然东西不早就没有了吗？”我跟他说这是着火时我俩扛出来的，他感激的不知说啥好，只不住的向我拱手。第二天早晨又有两个老乡回来搬东西，看着破落的院子发愁。我和董谋向他解释，打完仗民主政府会给想法的。他说：“知道的，没打完同志就冒火帮助抢出东西来。”
