　　Jize Completes Land Reform
    Impoverished Now Average Four Mu of Land
    [Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] Through the filling-in movement, Jize has victoriously completed land reform. The rule and exploitation of landlords have been thoroughly eliminated, and the average land holding of impoverished farmers has increased to more than four mu per person. In the past, although Jize had undergone struggles such as rent reduction, interest reduction, anti-corruption, and anti-concealment, feudal forces still ruled the countryside, either openly or secretly. For example, according to a survey of 76 villages before the purge, the land ownership of each class was as follows: landlords averaged 8.013 mu per person, rich peasants 5.99 mu, middle peasants 4.49 mu, poor peasants 3.24 mu, and the impoverished 2.59 mu. Each mu of land owned by a landlord was equivalent to five or six mu owned by the impoverished. Therefore, the peasants called the previous mass movement "turning over half of their bodies" and proposed to "turn over completely." This check-and-reduction movement began in early October last year and ended in late November. During the process, the 23 crimes of landlords were first brought forward based on survey materials, and it was clearly stated that "a wolf eats people," "a landlord drinks the blood of peasants," and "a thousand years of grievances will be avenged together." A large-scale liquidation movement against feudal landlords was then launched. By mid-October, the landlords of the entire county had been struggled against once, and the land problem of the peasants had been partially solved. However, the landlords had not yet surrendered and spread rumors to slander the peasant movement. In late October, a second upsurge was launched, emphasizing the need to speak out about grievances and expose the ugly conspiracies of the landlords. Economically, the struggle against floating wealth destroyed their material foundation, and a struggle to cut off the feudal tails of the rich peasants was also generally carried out. According to the previous survey of 76 villages, more than 20,000 mu of land, more than 1,000 courtyards, more than 9,000 houses, 657 livestock, and materials worth more than 39.9 million yuan, and more than 20,000 shi of grain were recovered. During the movement, due to the leadership's unclear policy towards middle peasants and the problems in analyzing class components, the interests of some middle peasants were harmed. After the discovery, help was given to correct the situation, and losses were appropriately dealt with or compensated according to the specific circumstances, and they were absorbed into the farmers' association. After this movement, according to the survey of the 76 villages, middle peasants received more than 3,000 mu of land, poor peasants received more than 10,000 mu of land, and the impoverished received more than 3,000 mu of land. The average land holding of landlords dropped from 8.013 mu per person to 4.353 mu per person. The average land holding of rich peasants dropped from 5.99 mu per person to 4.134 mu. The average land holding of middle peasants increased from 4.49 mu per person to 4.62 mu. The average land holding of poor peasants increased from 3.24 mu per person to 4.205 mu. The average land holding of the impoverished increased from 2.59 mu per person to 4.8 mu. In the distribution of fruits, the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers were generally taken care of, and they generally lived a middle-rich peasant life.

　　鸡泽完成土地改革
    赤贫平均有地四亩
    【本报冀南十七日电】经过填补运动，鸡泽胜利完成土地改革，地主的统治与剥削彻底消灭，贫苦农民每人土地平均增至四亩以上。过去鸡泽虽曾经过减租减息、反贪污、反黑瞒等斗争，但封建势力仍在或明或暗的统治着农村。如查灭前根据七十六个村的调查，各阶层的土地占有状况：地主每人平均八点零一三亩，富农五点九九亩，中农四点四九亩，贫农三点二四亩，赤贫二点五九亩。地主的土地每一亩地，相等于赤贫的五亩或六亩，因此农民把以前的群运称为“翻了半个身”，提出要“翻透身”。这次查减运动开始于去年十月初，结束于十一月底，进行中，首先根据调查材料，提出地主罪恶二十三条，并明确提出“是狼就吃人”，“是地主就喝农民的血”，“千古仇冤一齐报”。对封建地主大规模的清算运动随即展开。到十月中旬全县地主大都斗了一遍，农民的土地问题部分得到解决，但地主还没有屈服，且散布谣言污蔑农民运动。十月下旬又掀起二次高潮，强调诉苦揭发地主的丑恶阴谋，在经济上斗浮财又摧毁其物质基础，对富农亦普遍进行了割封建尾巴的斗争。仍按前七十六村调查，在查减运动中，共追回土地二万余亩，院落一千余所，房子九千余间，牲口六百五十七头，物资折款三千九百九十余万元，粮食二万余石。运动中因领导上对中农政策不够明确，分析成份也有毛病，致侵害了部分中农利益。发现后帮助纠正，并根据具体情况适当处理或赔偿损失并吸收参加农会。经过此次运动，仍据该七十六村调查，计中农分得土地三千余亩，贫农分得土地一万余亩，赤贫分得土地三千余亩，地主由每人平均八点零一三亩，降为每人平均四点三五三亩，富农原每人平均五点九九亩，现四点一三四亩，中农原每人平均四点四九亩，现四点六二亩，贫农原每人平均三点二四亩，现四点二零五亩，赤贫原每人平均二点五九亩，现四点八亩。分配果实中，普遍照顾了烈抗军工属，一般都过着中富农的生活。
