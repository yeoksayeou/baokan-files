　　Bo'ai Militia Fight Bravely Behind Enemy Lines
    Jiaozuo-Bo'ai Highway Under Our Control
    [This newspaper, Bo'ai News] From December 15th to January 29th, the Bo'ai militia work team went deep behind enemy lines, engaging in 25 battles. Currently, the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai Highway is completely under our control. The decrees of the democratic government are unimpeded, and landlords are returning the fruits of their "reverse accounting." The masses in the enemy strongholds mostly cross the highway at night to pay public grain to our democratic government. They say, "Dark clouds cannot obscure the blue sky, the Eighth Route Army will return." The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Bo'ai city are extremely panicked, and the puppet district office has retreated within the four gates. They often close the city gates tightly during the day, checking household registrations, saying there are Communists. The enemy and puppet soldiers' war-weariness is high, and desertion is rampant, with as many as thirty-five soldiers deserting in four days.

　　博爱民兵奋战敌后
    焦博公路为我控制
    【本报博爱讯】自十二月十五日至一月二十九日，博爱民兵武工队深入敌后，战斗二十五次。现焦博公路已完全为我控制。民主政府政令通行无阻，地主纷纷退还“倒算”去的果实，敌据点群众大都黑夜越过公路，向我民主政府缴纳公粮。他们说：“黑云蔽不了青天，八路军就要回来。”博爱城内蒋伪军异常恐慌，伪区署都退缩在四关内。常常白天紧闭城门，清查户口，说是有共产党。敌伪士兵厌战情绪高涨，逃风极盛，曾有四天开小差的达三十五人。
