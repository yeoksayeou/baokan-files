[This report from Taiyue on the 30th] The Qingxu Village in Qin County carried out the final task of "resolving knots" to solve disputes among farmers. During the land reform and great inspection, many villages raised opinions about some middle peasants, but they were not resolved at that time. Later, after it was clarified that the internal problems of farmers should not be resolved through struggle, those who had raised opinions stopped talking about them. Although the leadership repeatedly enlightened them, they still did not mention it, but it was ultimately a problem. Both the people who raised opinions and those who were subjected to them were uneasy. The former was worried because the IOUs were still in the hands of others, and they didn't know if they would have to pay them back in the future. The latter knew that there were problems and felt unstable without them being resolved. At this point, enlightenment was carried out and a free negotiation method was adopted. Both parties were free to decide how to resolve the issues. Individual conversations were held where possible and did not need to go through group meetings. If the group came to an agreement, it was not necessary to hold a general meeting. In this way, with open and honest communication, more than seventy problems were resolved within seven days, and one IOU was returned. During the high tide of the mass movement in Yuanyuan Village, a middle peasant threatened another middle peasant named Rang Gou Xiaobao, for a small debt, and compensated several hundred catties of reeds. Now, he also realized that this was not appropriate and personally returned the reeds to the original owner in full. The two sides talked, and the knot was untied.

　　青修农民自由议和中农问题迅获解决
    【本报太岳三十日电】沁县青修庄进行了最后一个课题“解疙瘩”，以解决农民互相间的纠纷。在翻身大检查时，即有许多村子提出一些中农的意见，但当时未解决，后来既经明确了农民内部问题不采用斗争方式，提过意见的人也就不说了。领导上虽多次启发他们，还是不提，但终久是个问题。提过意见的人与被提意见的人双方均不安，前者因文书还在别人手里，不知将来是否还要还账；后者自知有毛病不经解决自己觉得站不稳。至此进行启发，并采取自由议和方式，双方愿怎样解决就怎样解决，个别谈通了便不必经小组会议，小组谈通了便不必召开大会，如此开诚相见，七天之内，解决了七十余件问题，退回文书一张。年远庄群众运动正高潮时，曾因小债务问题，另一个中农威胁过中农让狗小包赔了数百斤芦苇，这时亦自知不妥当，亲自将芦苇如数退还原主，双方谈了一下，解了疙瘩。
