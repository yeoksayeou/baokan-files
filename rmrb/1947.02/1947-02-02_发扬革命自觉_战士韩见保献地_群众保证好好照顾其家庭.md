　　Promoting Revolutionary Consciousness
    Soldier Han Jianbao Donates Land
    Masses Guarantee Good Care for His Family
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] Han Jianbao of Shentou Village, Lucheng, was a landlord. He joined the Eighth Route Army the year before last. After more than a year of education in the army, he took leave in mid-December last year and voluntarily donated 12 mu of land, three earthen kilns, and a mule to repay the masses for their blood and sweat. He said to the masses, "My family used to exploit people, which was really wrong. It is right to repay them." The masses, considering him a revolutionary soldier and that the land he donated was not enough to fully compensate for the past blood and sweat debts, generously helped him and said to Han, "You should fight the reactionaries well. We will definitely take good care of your family." Han's family still has 12 mu of land, four earthen kilns, and all the household utensils and sundries remain untouched. Han recently returned to the army. Before leaving, he told his family, "Work hard in production to achieve a life of plenty through your own labor."

　　发扬革命自觉
    战士韩见保献地
    群众保证好好照顾其家庭
    【本报长治讯】潞城神头村韩见保系地主，于前年参加八路军，经一年多的部队教育，去年十二月中，请假返里，自动献出地十二亩、土窑三座、骡一头，偿还群众血汗果实。并向群众说：“我家过去剥削人，实在不对，偿还是应当的。”群众以其为革命军人，献出之田产，虽不足完全赔偿过去之血汗账，也慷慨相助，并对韩说：“你好好打反动派吧，你家我们一定好好照顾。”现韩家尚有土地十二亩，土窑四座，家中用具杂物完全未动。韩最近已返回部队，临行前嘱其家人说：“好好生产，以自己劳动闹个丰衣足食。”
