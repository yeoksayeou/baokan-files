Take the Initiative, Seize the Enemy and Crush Them
    The Great Development of Guerrilla Warfare in Anyang
    Duan Fazhang's Armed Work Team Creates a Small Guerrilla Base
    [Report from this newspaper in Anyang] In January, our Anyang troops took the initiative to strike deep behind enemy lines. Duan Fazhang's Armed Work Team alone recovered more than ten villages, with a total of 127 battles, large and small, of which only 25 were defensive battles. They burned more than 200 enemy pillboxes, killed 103 enemies (55 of whom were killed by landmines), wounded 97, and captured 24 puppet soldiers, "Homecoming Corps" members, and reactionary landlords. They seized 5 rifles, 3 pistols, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, and many other spoils of war. We sacrificed only one person and wounded six, creating a brilliant battle record of a casualty ratio of 7 to 200 between us and the enemy. The experience of guerrilla warfare in Anyang in January is as follows:
    (1) The merit-making campaign has reached an in-depth stage. Militiamen from all routes have more universally established the belief in killing the enemy to make meritorious contributions and the determination to sacrifice for the people. Zhang Dingkui, captain of the 10th District, wrote after being wounded: "I still want to make meritorious contributions for the people, I still want to fight! Although I am missing a hand, I still have one hand to kill the enemy..." Duan Fazhang, captain of the 3rd District, said: "It is glorious to die for the people."
    (2) Take the initiative to attack, go deep behind enemy lines, and crush the enemy when you catch them. For example, in the Battle of Shiyan on January 2nd, our southern militiamen cooperated with the ×× Regiment and resolved the battle in less than ten minutes, killing more than 70 members of the enemy's "Homecoming Corps," recovering all the villages in the 7th District, destroying more than 200 bunkers, and developing the situation in the 8th and 9th Districts, reaching directly to the railway line.
    (3) Closely combine landmine warfare with sniper warfare. Launch the blasting movement, establish blasting training classes, and blasting experts are further improving their mine-laying and camouflage techniques in training. Appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making the enemy lose heart. For example, the blasting team of the 6th District went deep behind enemy lines and planted landmines at the door, inside the desk, in the drawers, and under the legs of the chairs of the Xu Pu puppet office, killing an enemy secretary. The enemy and puppet personnel were frightened and said: "Now even the daytime is no longer our time."
    (4) Capture warfare. Our militia heroes often go deep behind enemy lines to capture traitors and bullies. Duan Fazhang from the 3rd District captured two reactionary landlords, Feng Bangcheng, etc., in Lijiachulu, Daye. Guo Migui and other militiamen from the 6th District captured Zhang Tongshan, the puppet secretary of the Third Village, etc., in Jiadian. This greatly encouraged the people behind enemy lines, frightened the bullies and secret agents, and smoothly carried out the counter-liquidation work. (Beidou)
    [Report from this newspaper in Taihang on the 17th] Duan Fazhang's Armed Work Team of Anyang × District, opened up the situation behind enemy lines and initially created a small guerrilla base. The team has been active behind enemy lines. Since the middle of last month, in 20 days, it has launched 16 attacks, killing and wounding three members of the "Homecoming Corps," capturing alive four puppet Bao chiefs, nine "counter-liquidation" traitors and bullies, one puppet township office secretary, and one member of the secret society armed forces, driving away the Homecoming Corps in five villages, and the regime has once again been grasped by the masses. The team has successively stabilized the emotions of the masses in seven villages, propagated policies and victory news, and exposed the deceptive propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. At the same time, it carried out organizational work, launched a counter-liquidation movement in nine villages, restored the armed forces of the masses, and launched guerrilla warfare. The confidence of the masses in victory has greatly increased, and many objects of struggle have approached the peasants under the comparison of the enemy's and our policies. This small guerrilla base behind enemy lines has become the team's base for taking the initiative to strike at Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. In the recent summary, 26 models of combat work, such as Duan Fazhang, Wang Jingui, and Chen Xiyun, were selected, and the Third District Headquarters specially awarded Jichaopiao 14,200 yuan.

　　主动出击抓住敌人就打垮他
    安阳游击战争大发展
    段法章武工队创小型游击根据地
    【本报安阳讯】一月份，安阳我军主动出击深入敌后，仅段法章武工队即收复十余村庄，计大小战斗一百二十七次，其中防御战仅二十五次。烧敌炮楼二百余个，毙敌一百零三名（五十五名系触雷炸死），伤九十七名，俘获伪军二十四名、“还乡团”及反动地主六十四名。缴步枪五枝，手枪三枝，子弹三百余发及其他战利品甚多。我仅牺牲一人，伤六人，造成我敌伤亡七比二百的光辉战例。一月份安阳游击战经验如次：
    （１）立功运动达到深入阶段。各路民兵更普遍地建立了杀敌立功的信念和为人民牺牲的决心。十区张鼎魁队长负伤后来信说：“我还要为人民立功，我还要战斗！我虽缺了一只手，可是还有一只手可以杀敌………”三区段法章队长说：“为人民而死是光荣的。”
    （２）主动出击，深入敌后，抓住敌人就打垮他。如一月二日石堰之战，我南路民兵与××团配合，不到十分钟就解决战斗，毙敌“还乡团”七十余人，收复七区全部村庄，平毁碉堡二百余座，并开展了八、九区局面，直达铁路线。
    （３）地雷战与冷枪战密切结合。开展炸破运动，设立爆炸训练班，爆炸能手们在训练中更提高埋雷和伪装等技术。神出鬼没，使敌人破胆。如六区爆炸队深入敌后，在许朴伪办公处门口、桌内、抽屉里、椅脚下都埋上地雷，炸死敌书记一名。吓得敌伪人员说：“现在白天也不是我们的天下了。”
    （４）捕捉战。我民兵英雄经常深入敌后捕捉奸霸，三区段法章同志在大堰李家炉捉回反动地主冯邦成等两名。六区民兵郭米贵等在贾店捕回伪三村总书记张同山等三人。大大地振奋了敌后人心，吓破了恶霸和特务们的胆，顺利地进行了反倒算工作。（北斗）
    【本报太行十七日电】安阳×区段法章武工队，打开敌后局面，初创小型游击根据地。该队在敌后活动，自上月中旬，二十天中，出击十六次，毙伤“还乡团”三名，活捉伪保长四名、“倒算”奸霸九名、伪乡公所书记一名、会门武装一名，赶走五个村的还乡团，政权又为群众掌握。该队先后在七个村安定群众情绪，宣传政策及胜利消息，揭穿蒋伪欺骗宣传。同时进行组织工作，在九个村展开反倒算运动，恢复群众武装，开展游击战。群众胜利信心大大提高，不少斗争对象在敌我政策对照下，靠近农民。这块小型敌后游击根据地，已成为该队主动打击蒋伪的根据地。最近总结中，选出战斗工作模范段法章、王金贵、陈息云等二十六名，三区指挥部特奖冀钞一万四千二百元整。
