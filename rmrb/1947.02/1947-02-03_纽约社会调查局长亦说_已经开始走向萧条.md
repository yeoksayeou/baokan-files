Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - According to Agence France-Presse, New York, 30th: The director of the Social Research Bureau, Baxter, believes that the United States is heading towards an undeniable economic depression, saying, "This will be the most serious one in our history." Mr. Baxter pointed out that huge military expenditures and heavy taxes have made people unable to purchase cars and radios. At the same time, Mr. Mason, the director of the management department of the National Association of Manufacturers, an organization of American monopoly capital, believes that the government can take measures to avoid an economic depression, namely, to abolish restrictions on prices and profits, and to abolish workers' right to strike. These so-called "measures" of Mr. Mason's cannot actually avoid a depression, but only shift the disasters caused by the depression to the broad masses of the people, especially the workers.

　　纽约社会调查局长亦说
    已经开始走向萧条
    【新华社延安一日电】据法国新闻社纽约三十日讯：社会调查局局长巴克斯特尔认为美国正走向无可置疑的经济萧条，并说：“这将是我们历史上最严重的一次”。巴氏指出军费浩大与捐税繁重，使人民无能购买汽车和无线电收音机。与此同时，美国独占资本组织的美国全国制造商协会的经理部主任马逊氏，则认为政府可以采取办法来避免经济萧条，即取消对物价及利润的限制，取消工人罢工权利。马氏这些所谓“办法”，其实并不能避免萧条，而只是将萧条所造成的灾难转嫁到广大人民阶层，特别是工人身上。
