    [This Newspaper, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 7th dispatch] The Eighth Route Army recovered the two county towns of Daming and Neihuang on the evening of the 6th. The defending Jiang army fled westward in a sorry state, and we are pursuing them in victory. Neihuang was invaded and occupied by the Jiang army on December 10th of last year, and Daming was invaded and occupied by the Jiang army in January of this year. The local Eighth Route Army and local guerrillas continuously besieged and attacked the enemy entrenched in these two cities, making them uneasy. After Nanle and Qingfeng were successively recovered, the enemy in these two cities became even more isolated. Tang Yongliang, commander of the 32nd Division of the Jiang army, personally sat in Daming, attempting to maintain this forward position extending into our liberated area, so as to wait for an opportunity to attack Handan from the north. However, with continuous defeats on the southern front, Neihuang and Daming were in a situation of being attacked from both sides. Moreover, the supply line of the Jiang army in the Anyang area of the Pinghan Railway was often cut off by militiamen and guerrillas. The Jiang army's 32nd Division and the puppet army Cheng Daosheng's troops, who were trapped in these two cities, were deeply afraid of being annihilated, so they were forced to abandon the cities and flee. Chiang Kai-shek's loudly proclaimed dream of "opening the Pinghan Railway and joining forces in Xingtai" has once again been declared shattered.
    [This Newspaper, Taihang, 6th dispatch] The Taihang Eighth Route Army captured the Jiang army stronghold of Fenjiangchi (north of Hetun Station) near Xinxiang on the evening of the 3rd. In this battle, a squadron of the Xinxiang Security Regiment was annihilated, killing more than ten enemies and capturing forty-six people below the squadron leader. Two machine guns, forty-eight rifles, and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition were seized, and nineteen enemy bunkers were destroyed. A platoon of the 58th Division of the Jiang army stationed near the stronghold fled in panic upon hearing the news, and five of them were captured alive by our forces.

    我军收复大名内黄
    蒋介石打通平汉线之迷梦又告破灭
    新乡附近蒋军据点分将池为我攻克
    【本报冀鲁前线七日电】八路军于六日晚收复大名、内黄两县城，守城蒋军狼狈西窜，我正乘胜追击中。按内黄于去年十二月十日为蒋军侵占，大名于今年一月为蒋军侵占，当地八路军及地方游击队不断对盘踞该两城之敌围困袭击，使其坐卧不安，自南乐、清丰相继收复后，该两城之敌愈陷孤立，蒋军三十二师师长唐永良虽亲至大名坐镇，企图保持此伸入我解放区之前沿阵地，以便待机北犯邯郸；但以南线不断失利，内黄、大名遂处于腹背受敌之境，其平汉线安阳一带之补给线又常遭民兵、游击队切断，困守该两城之蒋军三十二师及伪军程道生部深恐被歼，乃被迫弃城逃窜。蒋介石叫嚣的“打通平汉线、会师邢台”之迷梦，遂又一次宣告破灭。
    【本报太行六日电】太行八路军于三日晚攻克新乡蒋军据点分将池（何屯车站北）。是役，歼灭新乡保安团一个中队，计毙敌十余，俘中队长以下四十六人，缴机枪二挺，步枪四十八支，子弹三千余发，平毁敌碉堡十九座。驻该据点附近蒋军五十八师一个排，闻讯仓惶逃窜，为我生俘五名。
