　　Chiang Kai-shek Secret Order: Execute First, Report Later, for Officials Neglecting Duty in the Civil War
    [This Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front Line, 29th] Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered all military commanders to have the power to execute first and report later with regard to administrative personnel neglecting their duties in the civil war. When the Eighth Route Army recently recovered Puyang County in western Shandong, it seized the No. 786 Order of the Joint Office of the Party and Government of Lincheng County, Shandong Province, forwarded to the Puyang County Kuomintang Party Department. This order relayed a top-secret telegram issued personally by Chiang Kai-shek to the Shandong Provincial Government, stating: When Li Xiannian's troops broke through the encirclement in the Central Plains and fought their way to southern Shaanxi, Kuomintang county chiefs and county committees were extremely passive and offered no resistance. Furthermore, when the Eighth Route Army counterattacked along the Longhai Railway last year, the local people welcomed the Eighth Route Army, and local Bao and Jia leaders and the masses actively cooperated with the Eighth Route Army in destroying the roads. Therefore, it was decided that all Party and government officials in charge of the Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi areas would be executed according to the principle of collective responsibility, and the Bao and Jia leaders along the Longhai Railway would be severely punished. In the future, if any administrative officials at all levels neglect their duties in the civil war and the above-mentioned facts continue to occur, they will be dealt with by military law, and commanders are allowed to shoot them first and then report.

　　对内战怠工官吏蒋密令先斩后报
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】蒋介石手令各军事长官对内战怠工之行政人员有先斩后奏之权。八路军最近收复鲁西濮县城时，缴获国民党山东省临城区党政联合办事处转发给濮县国民党党部第七百八十六号训令，转达蒋山东省府所奉蒋介石亲手发出的机密电令，内称：李先念部中原突围转战陕南时，国民党各县长和县委异常消极，没有抵抗。而八路军去年在陇海路反击时，沿途民众欢迎八路军，当地保甲长及群众并积极配合八路军破路。为此，对豫鄂陕地区党政负责人员决定一律按照连座法处死刑，对于陇海路沿线保甲长决定严办。以后各级行政官吏，如对内战怠工、继续发生上述事实，都以军法从事，准允各长官先行枪决，而后呈报。
