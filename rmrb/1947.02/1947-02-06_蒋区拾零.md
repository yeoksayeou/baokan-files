    Gleanings from the Chiang Area
    Starting from the 29th of last month, the field reporters in Fuzhou and the special correspondents stationed in Fuzhou from Shanghai and Nanjing held a general strike. The reason was that the Fujian Provincial Government issued an order to its subordinates, strictly prohibiting officials at all levels from revealing information to journalists, and those who violated this would be punished for leaking official secrets.
    A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 31st revealed that in order to strengthen its control over the newspaper industry in various regions, the Kuomintang Propaganda Department issued an order to classify paper as a restricted import item, restricting its import, and promulgated six measures, forcibly ordering newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas to reduce their size.

    上月廿九日起，福州市外勤记者及京沪驻福州特派员举行总罢勤。原因为闽省府通令所属，严禁各级职员向新闻记者透露消息，违者以泄漏公务论罪。
    中央社南京卅一日电透露，国民党宣传部为加强其各地报业之控制，特下令将纸张列为限制进口物之一，限制输入，并颁布办法六项，强令蒋管区各地报纸缩减篇幅。
