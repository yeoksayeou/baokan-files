　　Political Report of the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League stated:
    China's Civil War is the Responsibility of Chiang and the U.S.
    Chiang Kai-shek's "Government Reorganization" Completely Closed the Door to Peace Talks
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th】 Shanghai Dispatch: The China Democratic League held a press conference here on the 20th. Present were Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, and central committee members Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Deng Chumin, and Liu Wang Liming. Luo Longji reported on the main points of the political report of the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic League. After pointing out the nature and policy of the China Democratic League, the report reviewed the process of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and the situation of the PCC resolutions being torn up by the Kuomintang. The report pointed out: The reason for the failure of the PCC was that the Kuomintang excluded the Northeast from the ceasefire scope in the ceasefire agreement, which was caused by the Kuomintang's anti-communist and the United States' anti-Soviet private intentions. The PCC was completely torn up because the Kuomintang reversed the procedures of the PCC resolutions and deliberately misinterpreted them, thus creating the current situation. The report analyzed the domestic situation and concluded: "The Chinese people need peace and hope to stop the civil war." The report summarized the international situation, pointing out that "the United States' foreign policy has made major mistakes, causing long-term civil war and division in China. The United States is the culprit of world peace." The report detailed the Kuomintang's anti-democratic and anti-peace actions over the past year, such as banning democratic publications and persecuting democrats, but it has failed to subdue the people. At present, the democratic movement is surging unprecedentedly. Finally, the report put forward the China Democratic League's three preconditions for participating in the resumption of peace talks: First, guaranteeing people's freedom; Second, the Kuomintang should stop the long-term civil war preparations of conscription; Third, the Kuomintang should earnestly recognize and respect the equal and legal status of political parties. At the same time, it put forward the China Democratic League's four proposals for the current situation: First, strive to resume peace talks, but resolutely oppose the Kuomintang's current measures to win over two small parties to reorganize the government, which is a policy of completely closing the door to peace talks. Second, re-hold the Political Consultative Conference, but the power of the PCC must be increased in the future, and the participating parties have the power to discuss the overall political, military, and economic issues of the country. Third, implement the previous PCC resolutions, but the China Democratic League agrees to modify the previous resolutions through consultation due to environmental changes. Fourth, establish a coalition government, and use local coalition governments as a transitional solution to solve practical problems.

　　民盟二中全会政治报告中称：
    中国内战责在蒋美
    蒋介石“改组政府”是彻底封闭和谈之门
    【新华社延安三十日电】上海讯：民盟二十日于此间举行记者招待会，到民盟主席张澜、中委沈钧儒、章伯钧、邓初民、刘王立明等，由罗隆基报告民盟二中全会政治报告要点。报告在指出民盟性质与方针之后，即检讨政协经过及政协决议被国民党撕毁情形。报告中指出：政协失败原因，是在停战协定中国民党将东北划在停战范围之外，这是由于国民党反共、美国反苏的私意所造成。政协被彻底撕毁，乃由于国民党将政协决议程序加以颠倒，故意曲解，故造成今日的局面。该报告分析国内情势，结论称：“中国人民需要和平，希望停止内战。”该报告总结国际形势，指出“美国外交政策犯重大错误，造成中国长期内战与分裂，美国实为世界和平之罪人”。报告详述国民党一年来反民主、反和平、封闭民主书刊、迫害民主人士等，但并未能使人民屈服，目前民主运动反而空前澎湃。最后，该报告提出民盟对参加恢复和谈的三个先决条件：一、保障人民自由；二、国民党应停止征兵征实的长期内战准备；三、国民党应切实承认并尊重党派平等合法地位。同时提出民盟的四项时局主张：第一、努力恢复和谈，但坚决反对国民党目前拉拢二小党改组政府的措施，此举是彻底封闭和谈之门的政策。第二、重新举行政治协商，但今后政协权力必须提高，而参加的各党派有权力商讨全国政治、军事、经济等全盘问题。第三、实行以往政协决议，但民盟同意因环境变迁，以协商方式修改前次决议。第四、成立联合政府，并以地方联合政府做过渡办法来解决现实问题。
