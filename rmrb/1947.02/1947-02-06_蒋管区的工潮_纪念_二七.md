    The Labor Movement in the Jiang-Controlled Areas
    —Commemorating the "February 7th" Incident
    On February 4, 1923, the workers of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, in order to resist the oppression of the Northern Warlords who were fostered and supported by imperialism, and to fight for the freedom and democratic rights to organize trade unions, carried out a general strike despite the bloody massacre, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese working class. Twenty-five years have passed since the "February 7th" Massacre. Today, China is once again on the eve of a high tide of the democratic movement, and the workers' movement in the Jiang-controlled areas is one of the main factors promoting this high tide. The following is a compilation of the workers' movement in the Jiang-controlled areas based on incomplete materials, as a commemoration of the "February 7th" Massacre.
                  —Editor
    From the victory in the Anti-Japanese War to the end of that year, more than 1,000 labor disputes occurred in Shanghai, and in the spring of last year, there was a rapid development. Forming an unprecedented climax, until the end of last year's demands for year-end bonuses and adjustment of treatment, it was sometimes slow and sometimes fierce, and never interrupted. The labor movement involved all industries in the city, including water and electricity, transportation, textiles, flour, customs, foreign firms, printing, books, rice and grain, tobacco, local products, shipyards, rickshaws, etc. According to statistics for the first half of last year alone, the number of people involved was more than 310,000.
    In addition to Shanghai, labor unrest also surged in other places. Workers in various private and "state-run" factories in Tianjin went on strike to demand wage increases in proportion to the rising prices of coal, grain, and oil. Workers at the East Asia Tobacco Company, affiliated with the Jiang government's Ministry of Economic Affairs in Qingdao, and printing workers throughout the city went on strike in November last year to demand wage increases. Wuxi silk reeling workers repeatedly went on strike over wage issues. In the major strike in September last year, male and female workers in more than 70 silk factories in the county were involved. In Guangzhou, in September last year alone, bus drivers and conductors, tailors, sailors, and watch factory workers successively went on strike to demand wage increases. Since the end of November 1945, after the Hong Kong authorities proposed to the Engineering Workers' Union to extend working hours, which aroused the workers' protest and struggle and won, strikes were held by workers of companies such as tram and power companies, the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and the four shipyards, water affairs, and telecommunications companies to demand improved treatment. Workers at the Minsheng Machinery Factory in Chongqing and all drivers on the Xiang-Qian Highway also went on strike in mid-September. The labor movement in the Jiang-controlled areas of the Northeast also began with the strike of tram workers in Changchun on October 6. Electric repair workers and railway employees in Qingdao, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Guiyang, and even Xi'an rose up in opposition to layoffs and pay cuts in September and October last year, and went on strike. The Pingjin Highway was even collectively shut down in protest against the Jiang government's collection of "road tolls."
    The fundamental reason for the surging labor unrest in various places is precisely the national economic depression and the crisis of national industry caused by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and civil war. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Authorities, in September last year, among the 167 labor disputes in Shanghai, those caused by dismissals, shutdowns, and layoffs accounted for 38 percent, ranking first among all types of labor disputes.
    The Jiang government relies on the excessive issuance of currency to supply the anti-people civil war, and prices have soared. The Shanghai labor dispute statistics for September last year show that those that occurred due to demands for adjustments to treatment accounted for 23 percent, ranking second among all types of labor disputes. In addition, the Jiang government's layoffs and pay cuts in various public utilities due to increased military spending for the civil war, as well as the destruction of workers' human rights and the suppression of the workers' democratic movement, are all causes of labor unrest.
    For these workers' legitimate demands and righteous actions, the Jiang government adopted cruel suppression, bloody massacres, or deceptive and shameless divisive tactics. During the large-scale labor unrest in Shanghai last spring, the Jiang government, on the one hand, expressed that it would "resolve the issues in a democratic way" and carried out some "mediation"; on the other hand, it openly prohibited strikes and attempted to suppress the labor unrest by means of massacres and arrests of workers. After the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the suppression was even more brutal. CC dispatched Gu Zhenggang, one of the special agents' leaders, to Shanghai to carry out activities to "weaken" the labor unrest. Subsequently, it announced the so-called "Labor-Capital Dispute Adjudication Measures" on April 24, which was actually a suppression measure that forced workers to be unable to strike or go slow. Since March last year, tragedies have continued to occur. In June, Gu Zhenggang shamelessly declared: "We must establish labor-capital cooperative factories," which in fact meant that workers had to work for them while starving, in order to be cruelly exploited. At the same time, this was also a conspiracy to expand the territory of CC's monopolistic business.
    The workers carried out resolute and heroic struggles against the Jiang government's atrocities and shameless suppression. During the hunger march of unemployed workers in Shanghai in January last year, they wrote their own blood and tears on the utility poles on Nanjing Road: "Work one day, eat one day, stop one day, starve one day," "Pawn everything, sell everything, eat everything." During the blood-stained clothing parades and petitions held in May and June to protest the authorities' suppression, the mothers and wives of the victimized workers also set off in rickshaws with the team. On May 31, more than 1,000 unemployed workers sat in front of the Social Bureau and carried a coffin to the City God Temple, shouting: "We have prepared the coffin. Today, either you die, or I die." These precisely demonstrate the tenacity of the Chinese working class's struggle, and are precisely the continuation and development of the heroic and tragic spirit of "Heads can be severed, but work cannot be resumed" in the "February 7th" Massacre.
    In the struggle, the workers and staff demonstrated great unity and organizational power, and the methods of struggle and political awareness were greatly improved and strengthened.
    In January last year, Shanghai workers proposed to the Political Consultative Conference the establishment of a coalition government, the revision of labor laws, and the eradication of fascist remnants and influences in factory management. In the February movement, workers and staff experienced the importance of peace and democracy from their own interests, and put forward slogans such as "Stop the civil war," "Chinese should not fight Chinese," and "Immediately realize a democratic coalition government," and realized that "to achieve democracy, we must rely on ourselves." On the "May Day" Labor day, they also issued a letter to the workers, clearly putting forward the task of eliminating fascism in any form and ensuring the victory of democracy and freedom.
    Along with the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his four major families, we believe that a new February 7th and a new high tide of the workers' democratic movement are coming soon. (Shi Jiang)

### 蒋管区的工潮——纪念“二七”

    蒋管区的工潮
    ——纪念“二七”
    一九二二年二月四日，京汉路工人为了反抗为帝国主义所豢养支持的北洋军阀之压迫，为了争取组织工会的自由与民主权利，不顾血腥的屠杀，实行总罢工，表现了中国工人阶级的英勇气概。“二七”惨案已经二十五年了，今天中国又处在民主运动高潮的前夜，蒋管区的工人运动是促进这个高潮的主要因素之一。兹根据不完全材料将蒋管区工人运动情况汇集如下，作为对于“二七”惨案的纪念。
                  ——编者
    在对日战争胜利后至该年年底，上海工潮即发生了一千多件，而去年春更有迅速发展。形成空前高潮，一直到去年年底的要求年关分红及调整待遇，时缓时烈，从未间断，卷入工潮者包括全市水电、交通、纺织、面粉、海关、洋行、印刷、书业、米粮、烟草、南货、船厂、人力车等等各业，人数仅去年上半年统计就有三十一万余人。
    除上海外，其他各地工潮亦风起云涌，天津各民营、“国营”工厂工人曾为要求按煤粮油各物上涨比例增加工资而怠工罢工。青岛蒋政府经济部所属东亚烟草公司及全市印刷工人于去年十一月间均因要求增资而罢工。无锡缫丝工人屡为工资问题罢工，去年九年间的大罢工，全县七十余家丝厂男女工人均卷入。广州于去年九月一个月中，先后发生公共汽车司机车员、缝衣匠、海员、及钟表厂工人要求增资的怠工。港九自一九四五年十一月底，香港当局向机工总会提出要延长工作时间而引起工人抗议斗争胜利后，又先后发生电车电力公司，广九铁路英段及四船坞水务邮电等公司工人的要求改善待遇或罢工。重庆民生机器厂工人及用湘公路全体司机工等亦于九月中罢工。东北蒋管区之工潮亦因十月六日长春电车工人的罢工而发端。青、渝、昆、蓉、筑乃至西安等各地电修工人及各铁路员工于去年九、十月间均纷起反对裁员减薪，并罢工。平津公路甚至因反对蒋政府征收“买路钱”而集体停驶。
    造成各地澎湃工潮的基本原因，正是由于蒋介石卖国独裁内战所招致的民生凋敝与民族工业的危机。据沪市当局统计，去年九月份上海一六七件工潮中，因解雇、停业、遣散所引起的占百分之三十八，占各类工潮首位。
    蒋政府依靠滥发通货，供应反人民内战，物价突飞猛涨，去年九月份上海劳资纠纷统计，说明因要求调整待遇而发生者达百分之二十三，占各类工潮的第二位。此外，蒋政府因增加内战军费，各公用事业裁员减薪，及摧残工人人权，镇压工人民主运动等等也都是激起工潮原因。
    对于这些工人们的这些正当要求，正义行动，蒋政府采取了残酷的镇压、血腥屠杀、或者欺骗与无耻分化的手段，去年春上海大规模工潮时，蒋政府一面表示“以民主方式解决”，并进行若干“调解”；一面则公开禁止罢工，以屠杀与逮捕工人等方法，企图镇压工潮。在国民党二中全会后，镇压尤为残酷，ＣＣ派遣特务头子之一谷正纲亲到上海，进行“削弱”工潮活动，随之公布四月二十四日的所谓“劳资纠纷评断办法”，实即强制工人不能罢工、怠工的镇压办法。去年三月起，惨案不断发生，六月间谷正纲更无耻地宣称：“要建立劳资合作工厂”，实际上是要工人为他们挨饿做工，以便残酷的剥削，同时，这也是扩大ＣＣ垄断事业地盘的一个阴谋花样。
    在蒋政府这种暴行与无耻镇压，同工人们进行了坚决与英勇的斗争。去年一月间上海失业工人的饥饿游行，在南京路电线杆上写出了自己的血泪语：“做一天吃一天，停一天饿一天”，“当光，卖光，吃光”。五、六月间为抗议当局镇压而举行的血衣游行请愿，被害工人的母亲妻子也乘三轮车随队出发。五月三十一日，一千多失业工人坐在社会局门口，并抬了一口棺材放在城隍庙里，高呼：“我们已预备好棺材，今天不是你死，就是我死”。这些正表现了中国工人阶级斗争的顽强性，也正是“二七”惨案中“头可断，工不可复”之英勇悲壮精神的继续与发展。
    在斗争中，职工们表现了很大的团结力与组织力，斗争的方法与政治觉悟也大大提高与加强了。
    上海工人在去年一月间，曾向政协提出成立联合政府。重订劳工法规，及根绝工厂管理中法西斯的残余和影响等提案。在二月运动中，职工们从切身利害体验到和平民主的重要性，提出“停止内战”，“中国人不打中国人”，“立即实现民主的联合政府”等口号，并认识到“要达到民主必须靠我们自己”。“五一”节又发表告工友书，明确提出了消灭任何方式之法西斯主义，使民主与自由获得胜利的任务。
    随着蒋介石及其四大家族的反动统治，我们相信，新的二七，新的工人民主运动高潮，不久就要到来的。（施绛）
