　　Jiang's Troops "Sweep" Southern Shanxi Mountains
    Implementing Four-Alls Atrocities
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 16th] The Jiang troops are conducting a devastating sweep in southern Shanxi, carrying out a four-alls policy of kill all, burn all, rape all, and loot all. Under this policy of destruction, in the mountain area of Xia County alone, in one night, more than 300 head of cattle were killed, 100 sheep, more than 500 pigs, more than 2,000 *shi* of grain were burned, more than 290 houses were burned, and even more than 570 cooking pots were destroyed. The houses in villages such as Gancun were completely burned. In addition, people were killed and raped everywhere. Farmer Zhao Gaoran was brutally murdered, and old Mrs. Wei of Xigou was stabbed more than 80 times. They even said, "Even a small tree by the side of this village must be cut down." Soldiers of the 31st Brigade said, "Kill all, loot all, burn all and see if you obey the government." As a result of the sweep, large numbers of local disaster victims were displaced and unable to live. But these affected people have not succumbed. "Even if Chiang Kai-shek is burned to ashes, we will never forget your four-alls method."

　　蒋军“扫荡”晋南山地
    实施四光暴政
    【本报太岳十六日电】蒋军在晋南进行毁灭性的扫荡，进行杀光、烧光、奸光、抢光的四光政策，在此毁灭政策之下，仅夏县山地一个夜晚就被杀死牛三百余头，羊一百只，猪五百余口，粮食烧毁二千余石，房屋烧毁二百九十余间，连煮饭锅也都被捣毁五百七十余口。干村等村子房屋全部烧毁。除此外，到处杀人奸淫，农民赵高然被残杀，西沟老卫媳妇被戳八十余刀，还说：“这村边的一株小树也要砍掉。”三十一旅的士兵说：“杀光、抢光、烧光看你服从不服从政府”。因此扫荡结束后，当地灾民大批流离失所，无法生活。但这些被灾的老百姓仍没有屈服，“把蒋介石烧成灰，也忘不了你的四光办法。”
