Xinhua News Agency, Lunan, 6th: Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive against Lunan began on the 26th of last month. Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng, in mid and late January, collected more than 200,000 troops from Northern Jiangsu, Lunan, and Jilu Yu areas, concentrated them along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway (Xuzhou-Haizhou line), and launched a four-pronged attack on the liberated areas north of the railway: One route advanced north from Yunhe Station, occupying Pixian County on the 26th (left flank); one route attacked Baijiaji from Wayao Station on the 30th, occupied Changnan and Wangjiayuan on the 31st, and occupied Matou Town southwest of Tancheng on the afternoon of the 1st; one route attacked north along the Shuyang-Linyi highway from Xin'anzhen on the 31st, occupying Tancheng at 4 pm on the 1st (the above two routes are the central route); one route attacked north from Xutang on the 30th, occupying Taolin Town southeast of Tancheng (right flank). The People's Liberation Army under the command of Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu is valiantly resisting.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Chiang Kai-shek's personal trip to Xuzhou on the 2nd of this month to command the unprecedented battle of Lunan, following Chen Cheng, has finally revealed the truth of his so-called "peace talks." This Lunan campaign was a long-planned scheme by Chiang Kai-shek since the offensive against the Suwan liberated area in early July last year. Before this, the Chiang troops in Xuzhou had repeatedly attempted to invade Linyi, but all failed. On January 10th, the day when Sun Ke, President of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan, issued a statement on "resuming peace talks," the 74th Division, 7th Division (formerly 7th Army), and 65th Division of the Chiang troops in Northern Jiangsu occupied Shuyang, more than 50 kilometers southwest of Haizhou. Following this, Chiang Kai-shek desperately mobilized large forces from Northern Jiangsu and other areas to attack the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's Lunan campaign plan, which had been blocked for half a year and had resulted in huge losses, was then actively put into action. On January 16th, the Kuomintang sent a so-called "peace plan" to the CCP through US Ambassador Stuart, and on January 17th, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to rush from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou to supervise the battle. On January 18th, the Chiang troops in the direction of Shuyang continued to advance north and occupied Xin'anzhen and its vicinity, located directly south of Linyi, the center of the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway. On January 23rd, the 11th Division of the Chiang troops in the direction of Suqian, west of Shuyang, advanced along the Grand Canal and occupied Pao Che and other places west of Xin'anzhen on the Longhai Line, and continued to advance north on the 26th, occupying Pixian County. At this time, the Chiang troops on the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Line and the Xuzhou-Lincheng section of the Jinpu Railway had gathered 25 divisions and three brigades, 65th Division two brigades (above are in the southeast of Linyi, as the right wing of the invasion of Linyi), 74th Division three brigades, 7th Division two brigades, 67th Division three regiments (above are directly south of Linyi, as the middle route of the attack on Linyi), 11th Division three brigades (in the southwest of Linyi, as the left wing of the attack on Linyi), and 58th Division one brigade, 77th Division two brigades, 59th Division two brigades, 64th Division two brigades, 20th Division two brigades (above are in the Xuzhou Taierzhuang, Lincheng area, may re-offend the Zao, Lanling, Xiangcheng line) and other units. On January 28th, coordinating with the ground forces' offensive, Zhou Zhirou, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Air Force, also rushed to Xuzhou to command the Kuomintang Air Force to indiscriminately bomb residents in Linyi, Feixian, Qufu, and other places. The Kuomintang Central News Agency also openly announced that "the prelude to the battle centered on Xuzhou has officially begun." On January 29th, Kuomintang spokesman Peng Xuepei stated that he rejected the CCP's proposal to restore the military positions of the January ceasefire last year through negotiations. On February 1st, Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division of the Chiang troops occupied Tancheng, about 50 kilometers directly south of Linyi. On February 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Chinese civil war, disregarded domestic and foreign criticism, abandoned the "peace talks" mask, and went to Xuzhou himself to command this unprecedented massacre.

In order to attack Lunan, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng not only mobilized large forces in the Longhai section and went to Xuzhou to supervise the battle, but also actively released the Yellow River water to return to its original course, in an attempt to cut off the connection between the liberated areas of Lunan and Jinji Luyu, and transferred the three divisions of the 5th Army, the 75th Division, the 27th Division, and the 49th Division (newly reorganized into the Second Rapid Column) from the Jilu Yu front and the Pinghan line to the Shangqiu, Dangshan, and Xuzhou lines. Wang Wu's Chiang troops on the Jiaoji Line also appear to be moving south to reinforce. Military observers here say that the large forces of the Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army have already moved south of the old course of the Yellow River and are threatening Xuzhou from both sides of the Longhai Railway to support Lunan, putting the Chiang troops in Xuzhou in a state of being attacked from both sides. And the Chiang troops on the Jiaoji Line cannot escape the attacks of the New Fourth Army on the Jiaoji Line.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: According to reports from the United Press and Associated Press: After his trip to Xuzhou on the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek secretly flew from Nanjing to Zhengzhou on the morning of the 4th, held a meeting of senior generals in Zhengzhou, and returned to Nanjing that day. The Associated Press said: "All indications prove that Chiang has ordered a full-scale general offensive." The United Press commented on the 4th: "Chiang Kai-shek's trip today, shrouded in secrecy and accompanied by many military aides and advisors, adds to the speculation that the civil war will tear up all hopes of resuming peace talks, and that the civil war will break out on a large scale everywhere."

    南京和平烟幕真相最后揭晓
    蒋军四路会犯鲁南
    山东人民解放军正英勇抗击
    冀鲁豫我军大兵团威胁徐州
    【新华社鲁南六日电】蒋介石对鲁南之大规模进攻，已于上月二十六日开始。蒋介石、陈诚于一月中下旬搜集苏北、鲁南、冀鲁各地部队约二十万以上兵力，集中陇海路东段徐（州）海（州）一线，分四路向铁路以北解放区进攻：一路自运河站向北进犯，二十六日侵占邳县城（左翼）；一路于三十日自瓦窑车站犯白家集，三十一日占昌南、王家园，至一日下午占领郯城西南之马头镇；一路于三十一日自新安镇沿沭（阳）临（沂）公路北犯，一日下午四时侵占郯城（以上两路为中路）；一路于三十日自徐塘北犯，侵占郯城东南之桃林镇（右翼）。刻陈毅、粟裕二将军所部人民解放军，正英勇抗击中。
    【新华社延安六日电】蒋介石继陈诚之后，于本月二日亲赴徐州指挥进攻鲁南的空前大战一事，已使其所谓“和谈”真相最后揭晓。此次鲁南会战，是蒋介石去年七月初进攻苏皖解放区以来久已预定的计划。在此以前，徐州方面蒋军虽曾数度进窥临沂，均告失败。至今年一月十日，即国民党立法院长孙科发表所谓“恢复和谈”声明之日，苏北蒋军七十四师、七师（原七军）、六十五师等部攻占海州西南五十余公里的沭阳，接着蒋介石即从苏北及其他地区拚命调集大军进攻陇海路徐海段之线，蒋介石在被阻半年之久、损失浩大兵力以后的鲁南会战计划乃得积极进行。一月十六日，国民党经美国司徒雷登大使向中共送出所谓“和平方案”，而一月十七日蒋介石即令其参谋总长陈诚由郑州赶赴徐州督战。一月十八日，沭阳方向的蒋军即继续向北进占陇海路徐海段中心临沂正南的新安镇及其附近。二十三日，沭阳以西宿迁方向的蒋军十一师，又沿运河进占新安镇以西、陇海线上的炮车等地，并于二十六日继续北进，侵占邳县。此时，陇海线徐海段与津浦路徐临（城）段蒋军，已集有二十五师三个旅，六十五师两个旅（以上在临沂东南，为进犯临沂之右翼），七十四师三个旅，七师两个旅，六十七师三个团（以上在临沂正南，为进攻临沂之中路），十一师三个旅（在临沂西南，为进攻临沂之左翼），及五十八师一个旅，七十七师两个旅，五十九师两个旅，六十四师两个旅，二十师两个旅（以上在徐州台儿庄、临城一带，可能重犯枣、兰陵、向城之线）等部。一月二十八日，配合着地面部队的进攻，国民党空军总司令周至柔亦赶赴徐州，指挥国民党空军向临沂、费县、曲阜等地居民滥施轰炸。而国民党中央社亦公开宣布“以徐州为中心之会战序幕，现已正式揭开”。一月二十九日，国民党发言人彭学沛声明拒绝中共以谈判方法恢复去年一月停战令时的军事位置，二月一日蒋军七十四师张灵甫部侵占临沂正南约五十公里的郯城，二月二日中国内战的头子蒋介石乃不顾中外责难，抛弃“和谈”面具，自赴徐州指挥这一空前的大屠杀。
    蒋介石、陈诚为了进攻鲁南，除在陇海段调集大军，并自赴徐州督战外，并积极放黄河水复归故道，以图隔断鲁南、晋冀鲁豫两区解放军联络，并自冀鲁豫前线、平汉沿线方面，赶调五军的三个师七十五师、二十七师及四十九师（新改第二快速纵队）至商邱、砀山、徐州之线。胶济线王武部蒋军，亦有南下增援模样。此间军事观察家称：冀鲁豫八路军之大兵团，已早出黄河故道以南，且自陇海路两侧威胁徐州，声援鲁南，使徐州方面蒋军处于腹背受敌状态。而胶济线蒋军，亦无法摆脱胶济线新四军的打击。
    【新华社延安六日电】据合众社美联社消息：蒋介石继二日徐州之行后，又于四日上午自南京秘密飞往郑州，在郑召开高级将领会议后，当日返京。美联社称：“一切迹象证明，蒋已下令全面总进攻”。合众社四日评称：“为秘密所笼罩、并带有很多军事副官及顾问的蒋介石今日之行，增加了此种猜测，即内战将撕破一切希望恢复和谈的借口，并且内战将在各地大规模爆发”。
