　　Anziling Rewards Livestock Feeding
    Implementing an Assessment and Differential Labor System
    [This newspaper reports] In the past, in Anziling, Wu'an, labor service was allocated based on livestock ownership, leading many households with livestock to sell them off. Since the implementation of the assessment and differential labor system in the first half of last year, the number of livestock has increased by more than thirty heads in half a year. The method for setting labor quotas is as follows: one point is assigned for an expected yield of three *shi* (石), one point for a mule, and 0.6 points for a donkey or ox. Laborers (aged 17-50) are assigned 0.6 points. The labor service grain is allocated based on these points. The differential price for labor service is stipulated as 15 *jin* (斤) of rice per day for one person driving one donkey transporting 104 *jin* of goods over 60 *li* (里) (5 *jin* for the person, 10 *jin* for the donkey). More or less transportation is converted according to this standard. Therefore, everyone is willing to transport more, overcoming the previous phenomenon of perfunctory labor service. One person driving two donkeys earns 26 *jin* of rice in differential price, with an extra *jin* awarded. This encourages households to raise two livestock and save labor by combining short-distance transport. Carrying a stretcher or other personal labor is worth 6 *jin* of rice per day. Militia deployments and village cadres attending meetings in other villages also count towards labor service, solving the problem of lost work time for militia and cadres. One *jin* of rice is worth one point, and labor service tickets are printed and distributed by the anti-conscription director. Long-distance labor services such as transporting public grain are allocated to mutual aid teams based on their labor service points. The mutual aid team is the unit for transportation, and households without livestock compensate with labor or wages within the team, combining voluntary transport with mutual aid. In this way, accounts are settled every half year, with households contributing more labor receiving rice, and those who don't buy livestock or avoid labor paying rice. As a result, the number of livestock has increased, and everyone is willing to perform labor service. Merchants in Yetao County used to be assigned labor service based on the number of people in their business, which was disadvantageous to small and loss-making merchants. Recently, it was discussed that every 50,000 yuan in profits would be equivalent to one laborer's labor service, taking into account both people and profits. Everyone responded well. The labor service of merchants and farmers is separated according to proportions, with the Merchants' Association bearing one-sixth of the total labor service. (Song Zhuqin)

　　安子岭奖励喂牲口
    实行评分支差办法
    【本报讯】武安安子岭过去按牲口支差，有牲口户纷纷出卖牲口，自去年前半年实行评分支差办法，半年来增加牲口三十多头。订分办法，按应产量三石订一分，骡一头订一分，驴牛订六厘，劳动力（十七岁——五十岁）订六厘，按分起支差米。出差差价规定一个人赶一个驴运六十里，重一百零四斤算一天，米十五斤（人算五斤，驴算十斤），多运少运按此标准折合。因此都愿多运，克服了以前支差应付现象。一人赶两个驴差价二十六斤，多算一斤，奖励一户喂两个牲口和捎差省工办法。抬担架等人差一天六斤米，民兵出发、村干部到外村开会均顶差，解决了民兵干部误工问题。一斤米作一分，印成差票由抗勤主任收发。义运公粮等长差，按支差分分到互助组内，以互助组为单位运，没牲口户在组内还工或付工资，使义运与互助结合起来。这样半年一算账，出差多的得米，不买牲口户躲差户出米。因此牲口增多，人人愿意出差。该县冶陶商人支差，以前按人派，小商人和赔钱商人很吃亏，最近讨论每红利五万元顶一劳力出差，人利兼顾负担，大家反映很好。商人与农民支差按比例分开，商联会负担支差总数六分之一。（宋祝勤）
