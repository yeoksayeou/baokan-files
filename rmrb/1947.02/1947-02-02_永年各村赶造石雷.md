　　[This dispatch from Weixian, dated the 30th of the month] The Yongnian Military Commission of Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has continuously held stone mine explosion training classes, organizing villages to rush to manufacture stone mines, and vigorously launch a mass-based stone mine warfare. They use broken stone tablets to make stone mines, with very good results, breaking the idea that stone mine explosions cannot be carried out on the plains. Broken stone tablets and broken stone rollers on the plains are all very good materials. The manufacturing method is simple and easy to learn. Now, all villages are actively rushing to manufacture them, preparing to crush the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive.
