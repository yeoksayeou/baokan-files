Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th—Our reporter interviewed Mr. Zhong Yantang, a landlord famous for persisting in struggle on the borderlands and for his righteousness in exterminating relatives, in a certain place in Dongtai. At the time, he was publicly recognized by the Dongtai gentry conference as a banner of struggle. Mr. Zhong is over forty years old, wearing a black coarse cloth gown, with agile manners and a humble attitude. He is a Christian who owns one hundred and thirty mu of land. He believes that the current patriotic self-defense war is consistent with the spirit of Christianity. He said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is perfect, but it must be achieved through struggle." He personally went near the Jiang army strongholds, captured Wa Fu, who betrayed the people and joined Jiang's "Homecoming Corps," and handed him over to the democratic government for legal action. He also entered the Jiang-occupied area many times at night, knocking on people's windows, reminding them, "Don't suffer! The New Fourth Army has been here for five or six years, which one wasn't for the benefit of the people? They will definitely come back." He even burned the official (more than thirty miles northeast of Hai'an) bunkers together with the armed work team. When the red light appeared in the darkness, he happily said, "The reactionaries demolished my house to build bunkers, but in the end, they were destroyed in my hands." The masses respected and loved him very much. His house was burned down by the Jiang army, and the masses gave up their houses for him to live in. He said, "The enthusiasm of the masses moved me very much." When talking about the recent Central News Agency's slander that the CCP was persecuting Christians in the liberated areas, he said, "This is nothing more than the reactionaries wanting to undermine the unity between the democratic government and Christians. There are currently two Christians near Libao, who were originally church members who moved from Haimen. After being allocated land in the land reform, their lives have been greatly improved, and Xu and Zhang are serving as village chiefs and teachers in the democratic government, participating in guerrilla warfare like me." Mr. Zhong has two daughters who are now serving in the Central China Rear Hospital.

　　坚持边乡斗争的地主
    仲延堂先生访问记
    华中通讯
    【新华社华中十八日电】记者于东台某地访问了坚持边乡斗争并以大义灭亲闻名的地主仲延堂先生，当时他正被东台士绅会议公认为一面斗争的旗帜。仲先生已年逾四十，着黑色粗布长袍，举止敏捷，待人谦和，他是一个拥有一百三十亩田的基督教徒，他认为目前的爱国自卫战争与基督教的精神是一致的，他说：“天国是美满的，但必须经过斗争才能实现。”他曾亲至蒋军据点附近，擒获背叛人民参加蒋记“还乡团”的娃福，送交民主政府法办。他还多次于深夜进入蒋占区，敲着人家窗户，提醒他们说：“不要受罪呀！新四军在这里五六年，那一件不是为老百姓？他们一定要回来的。”他更和武工队一起烧毁了官方（海安东北三十余里）的碉堡，当在黑暗中现出红光时，他高兴地说：“反动派拆我的房子筑碉堡，结果还是毁在我手里。”群众对他很敬爱，他的住屋被蒋军烧掉了，群众就让出房子给他住。他说：“群众热情使我感动极了”。谈到最近中央社污蔑中共残害解放区基督教徒，他说：“这无非是反动派想破坏民主政府与基督教徒之间的团结罢了，现在李堡附近就有二个基督教徒，他们原都是海门移来的教民，在土地改革中分得田地后，生活大大改善了，且有徐、张二人在民主政府任村长和教师，像我一样参加打游击。仲先生有两个女儿，现在华中后方医院服务。
