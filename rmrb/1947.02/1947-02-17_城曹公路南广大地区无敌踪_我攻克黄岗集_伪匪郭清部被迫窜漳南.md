　　[Jilu Yu Daily, 14th] Our local corps, in coordination with the main force's major victory on the main front, immediately entered the sandy area to actively attack the enemy. On January 16th, we eliminated the enemy at Dongzhuang. On the 19th, we eliminated the local reactionary Gao Di stronghold around Jingdian. On the 26th, we eliminated the enemy on an outing. The total results were 138 enemy killed or captured, and 42 long and short guns seized, as well as 111 sheep... Our casualties were one each. The captured sheep were immediately called for the masses to claim.
　　[Jilu Yu Daily, 15th] The enemy-rear guerrilla force in southeastern Caoxian launched continuous attacks on the 4th, 5th, and 7th of last month, capturing Huanggangji, annihilating 180 defending puppet troops, seizing one machine gun and 80 rifles. Four Chiang Kai-shek district headquarters and dozens of township governments fled in panic upon hearing the news. At present, there are no enemy traces in the vast area of 80 li north and south and 40 li east and west south of the Cheng (Wu) Cao (County) Highway.
　　[Jinan Daily, 15th] Bandit Guo Qing's troops, entrenched on the north bank of the Zhanghe River in Linzhang, have been continuously attacked by our army and people, and on the 8th they abandoned Zhangkantai, Yankantai, Gaozhuang Walin and other strongholds, and all fled back to Henan. Chiang's army, which retreated from Daming on the 6th, also crossed the river westward. Our pursuing troops killed, wounded, and captured 14 enemy soldiers in Zhangzhuang on the night of the 6th, seizing one light machine gun. Another unit of our army captured 6 enemy soldiers in Xiaowang Village, seizing 6 rifles.
