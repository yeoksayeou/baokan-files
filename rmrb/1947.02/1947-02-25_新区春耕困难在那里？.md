　　Lincheng Fourth District Organizes Investigation
　　Existing Labor and Animal Power Can Only Cultivate Half of the Land; Fertilizer, Farm Tools, and Firewood are Lacking Among All Classes
　　[Our Newspaper Taihang News] Amidst the preparations for spring plowing, Lincheng County conducted an in-depth investigation of its Fourth District. Before liberation, this district was a guerrilla zone. After a year of emancipation, the masses' enthusiasm for production is quite high. However, some people are unwilling to take more land, and there are "cutting韭菜 (chives)" thoughts towards the middle peasants. In addition, the lack of labor, animal power, fertilizer, firewood, and farm tools among the newly emancipated peasants has become a problem that needs to be solved urgently. For example, when farmers in villages like Shicheng divide the harvest, they prefer to take more movable property or houses and are unwilling to take more land, and some even return land. Some farmers still indulge in excessive eating and drinking, wasting the harvest. The district suffered greatly from enemy and puppet (Japanese collaborator) destruction in the past, resulting in a severe shortage of labor, animal power, and farm tools, especially among the newly emancipated peasants. On average, each male laborer in the district needs to cultivate more than 30 mu of land. If all women are involved in agricultural production, with two female full laborers equivalent to one male full laborer, each laborer still averages 20.4 mu, and each head of livestock needs to cultivate 54.3 mu. The situation is even more serious in villages near the railway, where, even with all men and women involved, each laborer averages 48 mu and each head of livestock averages 88 mu. According to local conditions, to cultivate the land well, each laborer can only cultivate 14 mu. Last year, there was a lot of wasteland, and most villages did not plow in the autumn. A survey of eleven emancipated households showed that they had only two shovels and one spade for more than 170 mu of land. In the Luzhuang Village with 73 households, the entire village had only two usable large hoes, and more than ten households shared an average of one spade and one shovel. Fertilizer and firewood are generally lacking. Four old middle-peasant households in Shicheng now have an average of only three dan (approx. 110 lbs) of manure per mu, and their firewood is mostly gathered as they burn it. As for mutual aid: in the villages that were organized last year, most accounts have not been settled, and there are many outstanding cases that need to be resolved urgently. Because there is a lot of wasteland, the county transferred more than 200 households from the mountainous areas of the old district last year. However, some immigrants have the idea of occupying resources in both places and are unwilling to abandon their old homes. In addition, local people sometimes mock the immigrants because of different customs, and some villages do not provide enough care for the immigrants when dividing the harvest, making them uneasy about production. Based on the above investigation, the county believes that if these problems are not solved promptly and vigorously, they will seriously affect this year's production campaign. The county has decided that, in addition to conducting production education for the masses in conjunction with checking the emancipation, it will vigorously rectify and develop mutual aid, solve the difficulties of the immigrants, and mobilize the masses to purchase livestock and farm tools, with a long-term perspective of breeding livestock.

　　新区春耕困难在那里？
    临城四区组织调查
    现有劳畜力仅能耕种半数土地肥料农具柴草各阶层均感缺乏
    【本报太行讯】准备春耕声中，临城县特对该县第四区作了深入的调查。该区解放前为游击区，经去年一年的翻身运动，群众生产情绪颇高。但部分群众中存在着不愿多要土地与中农的割韭菜思想等，以及劳力、畜力、肥料、柴草与翻身农民的农具困难，成为急待解决的问题。如石城等村农民分果实，愿多分动产或房屋而不愿多要土地，甚至有退地现象。个别农民尚有大吃大喝浪费果实现象。该区过去受敌伪摧残甚烈，劳、畜力、农具缺乏，新翻身农民尤甚。全区每一男劳力平均须耕种三十亩以上，如妇女全部投入农业生产，以两个女全劳力折一男全劳力，每一劳力亦平均二十亩四分，牲口则每头须耕种五十四亩三分。铁路附近村庄尤为严重，男女全部投入，每劳力亦平均四十八亩，每牲口平均八十八亩。根据当地条件，如须种好，每一劳力仅能种十四亩，去年荒地甚多，大部村庄没有秋耕。十一个翻身户的调查，共一百七十余亩土地仅有两把铲，一把锹。七十三户的炉庄村，全村只两把能用的大锄，十多户平均一把锹一把铲，肥料、柴草普遍缺乏。石城四户老中农现每亩平均仅有三担多粪，柴多是随烧随拾。至于互助：去年已组织的村庄，多未结账，悬案甚多，急待解决。因荒地多，去年该县曾从老区山地移来二百余户，但部分移民有两头占思想，不愿放弃老家。而当地又有因风俗不同，嘲笑移民，有的村分果实照顾移民不够，亦多不安心生产。该县根据以上调查，认为如不及时大力解决，将严重影响今年生产运动。决定除结合检查翻身对群众进行生产教育外，大力整顿与发展互助、解决移民困难，并动员群众购买牲口，农具，从长期着眼，繁殖牲口。
