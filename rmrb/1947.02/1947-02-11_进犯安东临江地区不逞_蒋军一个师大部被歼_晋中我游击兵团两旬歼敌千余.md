Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: The Liaodong Democratic Allied Army annihilated most of the Chiang Army's 195th Division, which had invaded the Linjiang area of Antung Province. The results are still being tallied. The entire 52nd Army and part of the New 6th Army of the Chiang forces began to aggressively attack Linjiang from the Tonghua area at the beginning of this month, dividing into two routes. The left route, the 195th Division of the 52nd Army, invaded areas such as Dongxi Gaolicheng, 30 kilometers northeast of Tonghua, on the 3rd. The Democratic Allied Army launched a counterattack in self-defense on the morning of the 5th. After a fierce battle until dusk, more than half of the division was annihilated. Its commander, Chen Linda, led over a thousand remnants in a panic back to Tonghua. The right route of the Chiang forces advanced east along the Tonghua-Linjiang railway line, and part of the New 22nd Division of its New 6th Army has also been routed. The Democratic Allied Army seized the opportunity to expand its gains and completely controlled Erdaojiang, the eastern gateway to Tonghua, by noon on the 5th. It is noted that Du Yuming had previously invaded Linjiang with four divisions in mid-December of last year, but failed. The Democratic Allied Army, which persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in Liaodong, has recovered most of the areas it had occupied.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 9th: A certain local guerrilla corps in central Shanxi, in twenty days from the 10th to the 30th of last month, crushed six plundering offensives by Yan's army, and recovered 19 strongholds such as Hekou and Madigou west of Yangqu. They killed or wounded 718 Yan soldiers, captured over 500 people including regimental commander Xing Wei, seized 348 rifles, 18 light and heavy machine guns, and 4 artillery pieces.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 9th: The Chiang army has increased its troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. In addition to the 53rd and 94th Armies originally stationed on the line, part of the 92nd Army was newly transferred from eastern Hebei, and the 16th Army and 22nd Division were transferred from southern Chahar to the Zhuoxian and Laishui areas north of Baoding, appearing to attempt to invade the Laiyi line again.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 9th: More than 600 of Fu Zuoyi's cavalry, accompanied by 33 vehicles and one tank, attacked the liberated area from Tuoketuo County. At 1:00 AM on the 3rd, they once again invaded Qingshuihe County, south of Sui.
