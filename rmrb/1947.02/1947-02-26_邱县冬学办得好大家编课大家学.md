　　【This dispatch from our Jinnan correspondent on the 24th】Qiu County's winter schools were established during the rent reduction movement. In the first and second districts alone, there are over 11,200 male and female students enrolled. Matou, through the winter school group, reorganized the Farmers' Association and purged bad members. Balangzhai conducted war preparedness education in the winter school, organized eleven sets of transportation stretchers and two sets of frontline stretchers, and completed the task of hiding grain and cotton within two days. Huatai Village held "thinking sessions" in the winter school. Chen Dawen said, "My father farmed for the landlord's steward for eighteen years when he was healthy. When the landlord built the house, my father overexerted himself, became prematurely weakened and disabled, and starved to death after being bedridden for three years." He couldn't continue speaking because he was crying, and the listeners were all moved to tears, hating the landlord even more. In addition, each village promoted the method of everyone compiling lessons and everyone learning. Cadres participated in winter school and compiled lessons and learned together with the masses. For example, when spending time in "thinking sessions," the story of Chen Dawen's suffering was compiled into teaching material: "Father of Dawen truly wronged; farmed for the landlord for eighteen years, every drop of blood, every drop of sweat, toiling and suffering beyond bearing, got injured, so pitiful, resentfully starved and died." The masses found it easy to learn, easy to remember, and also easy to struggle.

　　邱县冬学办得好大家编课大家学
    【本报冀南二十四日电】邱县冬学是查减运动中建立起来的，仅一二两区的统计，入学男女就有一万一千二百余人。马头通过冬学小组，整理了农会组织，刷洗了不好的会员。八郎寨在冬学里进行备战教育，组织转运担架十一付，火线担架二付，在两天内完成藏粮、藏棉任务。花台村在冬学里开想想会，陈大文说：“俺父亲给地主任清时种地十八年，给他盖房时又过分用了力，未老先衰残废了，三年未下炕饿死了。”他说到这里，哭的不能说了，听者都流下泪，对地主更加痛恨。此外各村还提倡了大家编课，大家学习的方法，干部参加冬学和群众一同编课，一同学习，如花费在开想想会时就将陈大文诉苦的事编成教材：“大文父亲真正冤；给地主种地十八年，一点血、一点汗、出力受罪不堪言，受了伤，真可怜，含愤挨饿归阴间。”群众易学、易记、也易斗争。
