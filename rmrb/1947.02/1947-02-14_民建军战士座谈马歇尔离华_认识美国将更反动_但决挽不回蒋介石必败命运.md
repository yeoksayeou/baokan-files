    民建军 Soldiers Discuss Marshall's Departure from China
    Recognizing America Will Be More Reactionary
    But Will Never Be Able to Save Chiang Kai-shek's Inevitable Defeat
    [This Newspaper News] Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Lu Ming reported: The soldiers of the Third Squad, Third Company of the Democratic National Construction Army held a meeting the other day to discuss the issue of Marshall's statement upon leaving China. Everyone spoke freely and eagerly. Soldier Xiong Jinsheng said, "Marshall has been in China for a year and has made many contributions to American imperialism. The most important thing is that he helped Chiang Kai-shek launch the civil war and seize China's sovereignty. I think he will definitely be promoted after he returns, but for China, it will be ominous." A soldier named Gao Shuping said, "There are many people in the United States who oppose Truman's approach to China, maybe that's why Marshall was recalled?" Before he finished speaking, Huang Guanglin interjected, "There is a problem with your statement. If that were really the case, why hasn't Truman withdrawn his troops when people all over the world have been opposing the US military's presence in China for a year?" Then everyone talked about their own views and unanimously believed: "Marshall is a good executor of Truman's reactionary policy towards China. He has completed the task Truman gave him, launching the civil war and turning China into a colony of American imperialism. After he returns, the United States will be even more reactionary and will help Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war." However, everyone firmly believed that no matter what, he would not be able to save Chiang Kai-shek from his inevitable defeat. Everyone also decided at the meeting to intensify military training, improve combat skills, and strive to participate in the patriotic self-defense war as soon as possible.

    民建军战士座谈马歇尔离华
    认识美国将更反动
    但决挽不回蒋介石必败命运
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者鲁明报导：民主建国军三连三班的战士们，日前开会座谈关于马歇尔离华声明问题，大家毫无拘束争先发言。战士熊金声说：“马歇尔在中国一年，给美帝国主义立了不少功劳，最主要的是帮助蒋介石发动了内战，夺取了中国的主权，我看他这次回去一定要升官，对中国可是凶多吉少。”一个叫高树培的战士说：“美国现在有许多人反对杜鲁门对中国的办法，也许是因此才把马歇尔召回的吧？”话未说完，黄广林就抢着说：“你这说法有问题，假若真是如此，那么全世界人民一年来都反对美军驻华，杜鲁门为啥不把他的军队撤回去呢？”接着大家都谈了自己的看法，一致认为：“马歇尔是杜鲁门对华反动政策的好执行者，他已完成了杜鲁门给他的任务，发动了内战，把中国变成美帝国主义的殖民地。他回去后，美国更要反动，更要帮助蒋介石独裁内战。”但大家坚信，无论如何他也挽不回蒋介石必败的命运。大家在会上并决定加紧练兵，提高战斗技术，争取早日参加爱国自卫战争。
