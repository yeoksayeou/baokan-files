    Beiliu Masses in Licheng
    Create a Model for Combining Investigation, Rent Reduction, and Production
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] Beiliu Village in Licheng County is a model production village in the entire county. In this winter's investigation and rent reduction, they created a model for combining winter production with the investigation and rent reduction movement. The village has a total of 230 households, with over 3,000 mu of land, averaging 4.1 mu per person. There are a total of 21 large and small cooperatives, a textile factory, workshops, a coal factory, and three production mutual aid teams and small winter schools. After the rent reduction was proposed last month, they used the mutual aid teams, textile teams, and factory workshops as units to deliberate, voluntarily forming twelve groups and eight emancipation brigades. They organized 92% of the entire village to participate in the movement. Cadres also went deep into the production units to conduct investigations and provide leadership. In terms of work arrangements, each group engaged in free production and deliberation during the day, and held collective meetings at the winter school in the evening to resolve problems. They organized the livestock for transportation, with one person driving several animals, and assigned activists to tell of their suffering and discuss policies of leveling and compensating land along the way. In the workshops and beside the spinning wheels, a hot wave of speaking bitterness and achieving emancipation formed. Zhao Shenshan's wife, a middle peasant, was spinning cotton when she saw the women weeping and telling of their suffering. Feeling that her husband was backward and not participating in the emancipation group, she went home and cried for half the night, saying: "I suffered poverty ever since I was in my maiden home. Now that I've come to your family, you're still showing sympathy to the landlord. When will we ever achieve emancipation?" After being mobilized, her husband also became active in the struggle. During the movement, they paid special attention to mobilizing backward peasants and old men to find the root of their poverty. The masses' emotions were high. Many people feared missing the opportunity to speak bitterness, and got up before dawn to carry coal and rush home to participate in the struggle. In the general meeting, many old women, old men, and young women who had never spoken before poured out their grievances on the spot. Their indignant shouts and tears brought tears to the eyes of every villager from other villages who came to the market. Granny Su Qin sat on the ground and questioned the landlord Zhang Zang: "How did my grandson die?" She said: "The old thief Zhang Zang bullied my granddaughter-in-law and sold 'golden pills' to impoverish my family's eighty mu of land. My grandson ran away to become a soldier and died." The speaking of bitterness moved all the women present, and they swarmed forward and beat Zhang Zang and his concubine severely. Then a thorough liquidation was carried out.

    创查减生产结合范例
    【本报黎城讯】黎城北流村，是全县生产模范村，在今冬查减中创造了冬季生产结合查减运动的范例。该村共二百三十户，有土地三千余亩。平均每人四亩一分。共有大小合作社二十一个。纺织厂、作坊、煤厂各一座，生产互助队及小型冬学各三个。上月提出查减后，他们以互助队、纺织队和工厂作坊为单位进行酝酿，自愿结合成十二个小组，八个翻身大队。组织起全村百分之九十二人，参加了运动。干部也按生产单位深入的进行调查和领导。在工作按排上，各组白天自由生产和酝酿，晚间在冬学集体开会解决问题。把牲口组织起来运输，一人赶几个牲口，并配备积极分子在路上诉苦、讨论填平补齐政策，在作坊里，在纺花车旁形成了诉苦翻身的热潮。中农赵生善女人，在纺花时，看见妇女们一把鼻子一把泪在诉苦，感到自己男人落后不参加翻身组回去哭了半夜说：“我从娘家就受穷，来婆家你还和地主讲情面，啥时才能翻身。”经过动员男人也积极起来斗争。在运动中他们特别注意动员落后农民和老汉找穷根，群众情绪高涨，许多人怕错过诉苦机会，都起五更驮炭，赶早回家参加斗争。在大会上，许多从不说话的老婆、老汉和年青妇女都当场倾倒自己的苦水，她们愤激的呼喊、泣涕使每个赶集的外村群众都落下了眼泪，苏芹奶奶坐在地上，质问地主张赃：“俺孙是怎样死的。”她说：“张赃老贼欺负了俺孙媳妇，又卖金丹把俺家八十亩地弄穷啦，孙子跑出去当兵死啦。”诉苦激动全场妇女，蜂涌上前把张赃和他小老婆痛打了一顿。接着进行彻底清算。（履端、东魁、芝田）
