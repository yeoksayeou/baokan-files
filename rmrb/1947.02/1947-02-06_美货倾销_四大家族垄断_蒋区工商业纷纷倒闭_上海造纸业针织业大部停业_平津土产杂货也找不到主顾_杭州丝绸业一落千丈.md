Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to the Tianjin Yishibao on January 27th: Amidst the cries of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in Shanghai, the paper industry is also facing a major crisis. Of the 23 paper mills in Shanghai, only about eight are barely able to maintain production, while the rest have all closed down. Even among those paper mills that are barely surviving, they operate intermittently, only working for two or three weeks each month. The biggest difficulty for the paper industry now is the difficulty in sourcing raw materials and the dumping of foreign paper. Before the war, most of the pulp used for papermaking came from the United States, Sweden, and Norway. Currently, the United States prohibits the export of pulp, and when ordering from Sweden and Norway, the Central Bank does not allow for foreign exchange rate increases. Foreign paper is dumped domestically, and the sales of domestic paper stagnate, making it impossible to turn over capital, further pushing the paper industry into a desperate situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to the Shanghai Shidai Daily on the 6th: Shanghai's knitting industry has fallen into dire straits due to the impact of American goods smuggling. According to industry insiders: American goods flooding the market, glass silk stockings sell for about 160,000 to 170,000 yuan per dozen, while the cost of domestic products is also as high as 150,000 yuan per dozen, so they cannot compete with American goods. Currently, knitting factories in the city such as Qihua, Yihua, Anzhong, Xingzhong, and Guotai have officially declared bankruptcy, and the rest that are barely operating are only working for three or four hours a day, in a very miserable situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to the Tianjin Yishibao on January 25th: The Tianjin native product market is operating sluggishly. Merchants dealing in native products, except for hog bristles, mostly suffer losses. The reason for the sluggishness of native products is the impact of the Chiang government's low exchange rate, where foreign prices are lower than Tianjin prices, leading to a decline in exports. In addition, many production areas have suffered war damage, and transportation is difficult, resulting in a general depression in the native product industry. Major Tianjin native product exports such as hides, wool, casings, egg products, and straw braid hats are all in a slump.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: Beijing dispatch on January 20th: The Chiang government's 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan banknotes have appeared on the market, stimulating prices in Beijing, causing them to rise sharply. Within three days, Canadian flour rose from 70,000 to 108,000 per bag, local flour rose from 39,000 to 56,000, and pork also jumped from 1,800 to 2,300 yuan per catty. The price of gold rose from around 400,000 to over 500,000 yuan per tael. Citizens' lives are becoming more difficult, and social order is increasingly chaotic. According to official statistics from the Chiang government, there are 20,000 households in Beijing in extreme poverty who need relief. In Tianjin, more than a dozen robberies occurred in the ten days leading up to the New Year. Accompanying the rising prices is a wave of shop closures. More than 200 shops have closed down in Beijing in the past month, and more than 50 tea merchants, southern goods merchants, and medicinal material merchants have closed down in Tianjin in the past month. More than 200 sundry goods merchants and salt merchants have closed down, more than 20 cotton cloth merchants have closed down, and more than 50 wholesalers have closed down.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao's Hangzhou dispatch on the 17th: Hangzhou's industry and commerce, known as "Paradise," are extremely desolate due to the impact of the civil war and inflation. Major products such as silk, satin, and tea cannot be exported, and industries are collapsing under the pressure of high-interest loans and high taxes. For example, Hangzhou Dalian Silk Company and Weicheng Company have recently announced the suspension of work due to tight cash flow and lack of raw material sources. Tian F茂 Shoe Store, which was known for its wealth before the war, had to close down at the end of the year. According to the Hangzhou Municipal Government's report, as of the end of last year, more than 250 factories and businesses had closed down within a year.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 30th: Shanghai dispatch: The companies of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, the Central, China, and Communications Banks, the Central Trust Bureau, and other institutions, jointly formed a "Shanghai Silk Export Special Committee" on the 15th of this month, and agreed with various silk companies in Shanghai that foreign trade in silk products will be monopolized by them.

    美货倾销·四大家族垄断
    蒋区工商业纷纷倒闭
    上海造纸业针织业大部停业
    平津土产杂货也找不到主顾
    杭州丝绸业一落千丈
    【新华社延安二日电】据上月二十七日天津益世报讯：在上海一片工商业倒闭声中，造纸工业亦面临重大危机。沪市纸厂二十三家中，目前勉强能维持生产的仅十分之八，其余均已全部闭歇。就在这勉强维持的纸厂中，亦时开时停，每月仅开工二三星期。造纸业目前最大的困难，是原料来源困难，与洋纸倾销。战前造纸用的纸浆，大多来自美国、瑞典、挪威。目前美国禁止纸浆出口，向瑞挪定购，中央银行又不允外汇加价，洋纸倾销国内，国产纸张销路停滞，资金无法周转，更使造纸业沦于绝境。
    【新华社延安二日电】据沪时代日报六日载：沪市针织业受美货走私影响，已陷入山穷水尽的困境。据该业中人称：充满市场的美货，玻璃丝袜每打售价约为十六七万元，而国产品成本每打亦达十五万元，故无法与美货竞争。目前本市针织厂已有琪华、益华、安中、兴中、国泰等厂正式宣告歇业，其余勉强开工的，每日开工不过三四小时，处境甚为凄惨。
    【新华社延安二日电】据上月二十五日天津益世报称：津市土产市场，营业颇为不振。经营土产的商人除猪鬃以外，大都感受亏折。土产业不振的原因，为受蒋政府低汇率影响，国外价格比津市价格低，输出减退；加以产地多遭受内战生产破坏，交通困难，遂使土产业普遍呈萧条景象。占天津土产业出口大宗之皮张、毛绒、肠衣、蛋品、草帽辫等均呈一蹶不振现象。
    【新华社延安二日电】北平上月二十日讯：蒋政府五千元与万元大钞，出现市面，刺激平市物价，急剧上涨。三天内加拿大面粉每袋由七万涨至十万零八千，土面粉由三万九千涨至五万六千，猪肉每斤也由一千八百跳跃至二千三百元，金价每两由四十万左右进而突破五十万元大关。市民生活更觉困难，社会秩序益形紊乱。据蒋政府官方统计，平市赤贫必须救济的就有二万户，津市在临近年关十天内，就发生抢案一十余起。与涨风同时袭来的，是商店的倒风。平市一月来商店倒闭达二百余家，天津一月来茶商、南货商、药材商倒闭五十余家。杂货商、盐商倒闭二百余家，棉布商倒闭二十余家，批发商倒闭五十余家。
    【新华社延安二日电】据十七日天津大公报杭州通讯称：素以“天堂”见称的杭州工商业，因受内战与通货膨胀等影响，至为凋敝。主要的物产丝、绸、茶叶均不能外销，工业则受高利贷高捐税的压迫，而纷纷倒闭。如杭州大联丝绸公司、纬成公司，近来亦因周转不灵及原料来源缺乏，而宣告停工。战前素称殷富的田福茂鞋庄，亦不得不于年终倒闭。即据杭市府报告，截至去年年底止，一年中停歇工厂商号，已达二百五十余家。
    【新华社延安三十日电】沪讯：蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家之中的公司，中央、中国、交西三大银行，中央信托局等机关，于本月十五日合组一“上海丝织输出特种委员会”，并与上海丝织各公司约定，丝织品对外贸易，均将被其垄断。
