　　Zhuxian Eighth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Districts
    Speaking Bitterness, Clearing Accounts, and Distributing Land
    Landlords and Destitute Peasants Eliminated in Li Hai Village
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 29th dispatch] Currently, the land reform and speaking bitterness movement in the eighth, ninth, and thirteenth districts of Zhuxian County (Liaocheng) are being carried out vigorously. More than 30 traitors and local bullies have been liquidated. The masses in Litang Village, Ninth District, conducted a demonstration and parade, and struggled against eleven landlord bad eggs. The land reform in the county has only just begun. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses is high, and they are busy day and night with this momentous happy event.
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 29th dispatch] In Li Hai Village, Zhuxian (Liaocheng), since the implementation of land reform, two destitute households and seventy-three poor peasant households have been upgraded to middle peasants, and 70% of the masses have been organized. Li Hai, Zhuxian, is a well-known village in the Tenth District. Before the land reform, the village originally had 216 households. Due to being unable to withstand the years of famine and the persecution of the puppet Third Detachment, seven households fled to other villages, and 39 households went to Shanhaiguan (Northeast). There were actually 170 households, including three landlord households, averaging 16.4 mu of land per person; 12 rich peasant households, averaging 8 mu of land; 81 poor peasant households, averaging 2.745 mu of land; and two destitute households with no land. The work in the village went through three stages: returning land, anti-traitor speaking bitterness, and land reform. During the return of land, the farmers' association only had 20-30 people. After the anti-traitor speaking bitterness and land reform, it has grown to 137 people. The anti-traitor speaking bitterness and land reform struggled against 21 households, obtaining 20,230 jin of millet and 23,420 jin of wheat, 136.5 mu of land. In addition, eight households donated land, totaling 56.3 mu. This distribution of fruits was studied very carefully and thoroughly, and fully promoted democratic discussion, using group discussions and collective voting. These fruits of grain were divided equally according to the circumstances of wealth and poverty, and the land was divided according to the leveling method, that is, divided according to about three mu per person, and when divided, the allocation was made according to the convenience of cultivation and the combination of good and bad land and high and low land, so everyone was very happy. After the land distribution in Li Hai, there were no more landlords, and two destitute households and seventy-three poor peasant households were upgraded to middle peasants. Because the peasants received land and grain, their enthusiasm was extremely high, work was automatic, and various organizations were also developed and strengthened. Those who participated in various organizations accounted for 70% of the total population.
