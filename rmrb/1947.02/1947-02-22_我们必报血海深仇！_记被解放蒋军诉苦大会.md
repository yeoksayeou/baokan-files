　　We Must Avenge This Blood Debt!
    ——A Record of Liberated KMT Soldiers' Grievance Meeting
    In a five-room house, two hundred and forty brothers, liberated from the KMT army by one of our units in the Yuanqu Campaign, were gathered. Today, on this free land, they were recounting the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and settling their blood debts one by one, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek must pay.
    Wang Qingwa spoke to the other brothers through his tears, and all the brothers lowered their heads: "Brothers, I am from Tianshui, Gansu. My family consists of my parents, older brother and sister-in-law, a family of five, living in two dilapidated houses, with a dozen or so acres of hillside land. But the Chiang government constantly demanded grain and money year after year, leaving us with little to eat and wear, relying entirely on my brother carrying cotton on a shoulder pole to make a living. One day in February of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], my brother returned carrying cotton, and as soon as one foot stepped into the door, Guo, the village head, arrived with several people. He said only one sentence: 'He is your 'conscript', let's go, official business is urgent!' Without saying a second word, they tied my brother up and dragged him away. My parents knelt down and kowtowed to them, pleading with them, but it was no use, watching them drag him away. That night, my brother secretly ran home, his hands still tied, wearing nothing but rags, his whole body frozen stiff. He died the next night! (Weeping) Because we couldn't afford a coffin, my mother bought five feet of plain white cloth and sewed a cloth bag. My father wove a willow basket, and we put my brother in it and buried him. The day after my brother was buried, my father died of anger! (Weeping) Guo, the village head, came again, holding an egg-thick stick in his hand, pointing at my mother and saying: 'Even if your whole family dies, you still have to provide a conscript!' My mother was so angry that she spoke harshly, saying: 'Go get a knife and kill my whole family!' Enraged, Guo, the village head, raised his stick and beat her, driving my mother and me out of the house. My sister-in-law hanged herself from the beam! (Weeping) In just four days, not only did three members of my family die, but Guo, the village head, also seized our house, saying that it wasn't enough to pay for the conscript. By the fifth day, my family had become homeless dogs. My mother went out begging, and I herded sheep for Guo, the village head, to offset the conscript fee. In the dead of winter, my mother took off the cotton clothes from the body of a dead child in the wild, and I finally got some cotton clothes to wear, but Guo, the village head's wife, took the cotton out again. The next year, he still counted me as offsetting the conscript fee."
    Kang Xiaotang burst into loud sobs as soon as he spoke. He said between sobs: "Brothers, I am from Kaifeng, Henan. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], the dog-day Chiang Kai-shek breached the Yellow River, causing a great flood. My family of four fled to Tongbai County to escape the famine. We didn't return home until the 31st year [1942], but there was still nothing to eat, and my mother starved to death. After my mother died, my brother sold my sister-in-law to buy a coffin. My brother and I cried bitterly, and after starving for a day, we ran to Daqiao Village in Weishi County and were sold to the division headquarters by the conscription office. My brother was in the eleventh company, and I was in the twelfth company. Who knew that being a soldier also meant starving? We got two meals of corn a day, not enough to fill our stomachs, and we were constantly standing at attention and at ease. The slightest mistake meant a beating with sticks, and my body was constantly covered in bloody welts. In May or June of the 32nd year [1943], we marched from Weishi County to Xiaoyuzhou. My brother had a nosebleed and fainted, and they buried him alive! (Loud crying) I complained, and my squad leader slapped me several times, saying: 'Cry, cry, go with your brother!' My heart ached, but I dared not shed tears! A few days later, I fell ill and was sent to the hospital. I wanted a drink of boiled water, and I called for my parents for a whole day, but no one came to see me. I had to crawl to the door to relieve myself. After living like this for a few months, I almost lost my life. After I recovered, I was sent to the transportation company of the 55th Army. Every day, I carried two boxes of ammunition while marching. If I couldn't carry them, I was beaten with a carrying pole. This continued until the Japanese surrendered, and the army moved eastward. On the way, I deserted. At Zehe, I was caught by the 90th Army. On January 12th of last year [1946], at Tianzhuang in Mengjin, we were told to clean our guns, which meant crossing the river to fight the Eighth Route Army. The platoon leader said I hadn't cleaned my gun properly and slapped me a few times. My head was spinning and I couldn't stand straight, so he said I was 'disrespecting my superior' and stabbed me with a bayonet. Now that I've come to the liberated area, it's like coming home. I knew long ago that the Eighth Route Army was for the poor. If I had come earlier, I wouldn't have suffered so much! (Weeping) My family died so miserably! I want to catch Chiang Kai-shek, and if I don't flay him alive, I'm not worthy of being born a human being!"
    At this time, the meeting place was filled with crying, and all the brothers were weeping. Their eyes were hidden under the brims of their caps, and their hands were constantly wiping away tears. They were recounting the darkness and cruelty within the KMT army. Duan Youming, from Beitongguan, was also conscripted. He said he had lived in the "Skinning Hall" (division headquarters) and the "Hall of the King of Hell" (political training office), and the beatings and scoldings were countless. In the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he contracted dysentery in Caijiawan, ×nan. He had to climb mountains every day. One time, he couldn't climb up, and the company commander said: "Even if you die, you have to drag your corpse up for me." He managed to climb up, and the company commander gathered the whole company to make an example of him. The squad leader and deputy squad leader took turns beating him with tree branches until he almost died. Wang Xingkai was also tied up with ropes. He fed horses for the company commander in the fifth company of the 164th Regiment. When the horse died, the company commander wanted him to pay with his life, insisting on strangling him with a rope. The rope was already around his neck and about to be pulled when someone noticed and spared his life. Meng Xianwu said: "The things that the officers do are unspeakable. We had a He Qingyang in our company, from Hunan, who was also an old soldier of seven or eight years. In the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he was stationed in ×fang Village, Luochuan. He was so homesick that he went crazy, cursing and hitting people every day. The officers didn't care, saying: 'It's his own fault if he dies.' One time, he ran away and didn't come back for a day. We went to look for him at night and found him dead in a temple. The company commander used this as an excuse to tie up all the village chiefs and heads of the baojia system, saying that the common people had killed him, and hung them up and beat them. The village chief paid two hundred thousand yuan, which the company commander pocketed. He Qingyang was buried in a mat. In less than a few days, dogs dug up his body, tearing it into pieces. The brothers would cry whenever He Qingyang was mentioned."
    Their two hundred and forty mouths were endlessly recounting, two hundred and forty people were shedding tears, and two hundred and forty hearts issued vows of revenge: "Serve the people to the end, and avenge our blood debt!"

　　我们必报血海深仇！
    ——记被解放蒋军诉苦大会
    一座五间大的房子里，垣曲战役被我某部队解放的二百四十名弟兄们在集会，他们今天在这自由的土地上，诉说着蒋介石的罪恶，而且一宗一宗的清算着血账，他们要蒋介石必须偿还。
    王青娃痛哭着对其他的弟兄们讲，所有的弟兄们都低下了头：“兄弟是甘肃天水人，家有父母哥嫂，一家五口人，两间破房，十几亩山坡地。但蒋政府一年到头不断要粮要款，闹得少吃少穿，全凭我哥耍扁担担棉花过日月。民国三十二年二月的一天，哥担花回来，一只脚刚踏进门里，村里郭保长带着几个人来了，只说了一句话：‘是你的‘壮丁’，走吧，公事紧！’没说第二句话，把哥随手捆住，拉上就走。爹娘跪下给人家磕响头，说多少好话都不济事，看着人家拉走了。当天半夜，哥偷跑回家，手还被绑着，上下没穿一根纱，一身都冻发僵了，到第二天黑夜就死了！（痛哭）因为买不起棺材，娘买了五尺生白布，缝了一个布袋，爹编了一个柳条筐，把哥装殓上埋了。哥埋了第二天，爹就活活气死了呀！（痛哭）郭保长可又来了，手里拿着一根鸡蛋粗棍子，指着娘说：“你一家人死完，也得给我出壮丁”娘太生气了，出口没好话，说：‘你去拿刀子来，把我一家人都杀了吧！’惹恼了郭保长挥起棍子便打，把我母子赶出家，嫂子吊死在梁上！（痛哭）没过四天，我一家死了三口人不说，郭保长把房子也都霸占了，还说不够人家的壮丁钱。到第五天，我一家就成没窝狗了。娘出去讨饭，我给郭保长放羊，顶壮丁钱。十冬腊月了，娘在野外把死了的孩子身上的棉衣剥下来，我才换上了棉衣，但郭保长的老婆，又把棉花掏了去。到第二年，他又把我顶了壮丁的数。
    康孝堂一开口就大放悲声的哭了，他不成声的说：“弟兄们，我是河南开封人。民国二十七年，狗日的老蒋把黄河掘开了，遭了大水灾，我一家四口人，到桐柏县去逃荒。三十一年才逃回来，到家还是没有什吃，娘就饿死了。娘死了，哥把嫂卖了，买了副棺木。我兄弟俩抱住大哭，饿肚子一天，跑到尉氏县大桥村，被招兵处卖到师管区了，哥在十一连，我在十二连。谁知道当兵也是饿肚子，一天两顿玉谷粮，喝不饱，整天是立正稍息，一点不对就是棍子打，身上打的血道子就没落过。三十二年五六月间，从尉氏县行军到小禹州，哥流鼻血流迷了，没死就拉出去埋了！（大哭）我诉说，我班长打了我几个耳巴说：‘哭，哭，跟你哥一路去’我心里痛，眼里不敢流泪！没几天生了病，被送到医院，想喝口开水，爹呀娘呀叫了一天也没人去打照面。屎尿自己爬到门口。这样住了几个月，几乎把命送了。病好了，又到五十五军运输连，每天抬两箱子炮弹行军，抬不动就是扁担打，这一直到日本投降，队伍往东边开，路上我开了小差。到泽河又叫九十军抓住。去年（三十五年）元月十二日，在孟津田庄叫擦枪，就是要过河打八路军。排长说我枪没擦好，打了几耳巴，头打晕了没立正，说我‘藐视上级’，又用刺刀在身上乱扎。现在来到解放区，就跟到我家一样。我早知道八路军是为穷人，早来些时，也不会受那症呀！（痛哭）我一家人死的好苦呀，我要捉住蒋介石，不活剥他的皮，就不是人生父母养的！”
    这时会场充满了哭声，所有的弟兄们都哭了。他们的两眼掩盖在大盖的帽子下，双手不停的擦着眼。他们诉说着蒋军内部的黑暗与残忍，段有明是北潼关人，也是抓出来的，他说他住过“剥皮厅”（师管区）、“阎王殿”（政训处），挨打受骂就说不清。三十三年在×南蔡家湾害痢疾，每天爬山，有一次爬不上去，连长说：“死了也得把尸首给我拉上来”。他硬爬上去，连长集合全连人要作样给大家看，正副班长轮替着用树枝打得他断了一遍气。王兴开也是用绳子绑出来的，他在一六四团五连给连长喂马，马死了，连长要他抵命，非要用绳子勒死他不行。绳子套在脖子上就要拉，被人发觉了才饶了命，孟宪吾说：“当官人作的事就不能提，我们连有个何清扬，是湖南人，也是七八年的老弟兄，三十三年，在洛川×房村驻，他想家急疯了，每天乱打乱骂，当官的也不管，说：‘死了活该’。有一次跑出去一天没回来，晚上去找他，已死在大庙里了。连长借口这事，把村里的保甲长都绑起，说老百姓把人害了，吊起打。保长上了两万元，连长装到腰包了，一条席把何清扬卷着埋了。不到几天，狗把他的尸体刨出来，拉得东一块西一块，弟兄们一提起何清扬就流泪。”
    他们二百四十张嘴在无尽的倾诉着，二百四十个人在流着泪，二百四十颗心发出了复仇的誓言：“为人民服务到底，报我们的血海深仇”！
