　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 24th: United Press International, London, February 23rd: It is reported that the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to establish an economic agreement with Britain in addition to a political agreement. British diplomatic experts believe that there are definite signs that the Soviet Union is willing to have a comprehensive and economic understanding to supplement the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. Britain is expected to provide a large amount of machinery and other important equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials. Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have been going on for quite some time, and the British government recently suggested sending Overseas Trade Minister Marquand to Moscow again to continue discussions.

　　英苏可能缔结经济协定
    【新华社延安二十四日电】合众社伦敦二十三日电称，据息：苏联曾表示愿与英国除了政治协定之外，再成立经济协定。英外交专家相信有确定的征象，说明苏联愿有全面的与经济的谅解，以作英苏同盟条约的补充。英国预料可提供大量的机器及其他重要装备，以换取苏联的原料。英苏贸易谈判已进行了相当长的时间，英政府最近建议再派海外贸易部长马昆前往莫斯科赓续讨论。
