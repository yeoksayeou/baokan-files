　　Cadres in Bao Village Raise Awareness
    Return Gains, and Change Their Style
    [This article was] Transmitted by Taiyue [region] on the 19th [of February] – In Bao Village, Fifth District of Changzi [county], the slogan "Cadres must perform meritorious service for the masses" was put forward, transforming the cadres and their work. During the land reform movement last year, the work style of the village cadres was very poor. Due to revenge and personal grudges, five middle peasant households were wrongly struggled against. Several cadres locked themselves in the temple to distribute the gains, without going through the masses. They gave themselves the best shares and gave the worst to the masses, and they even kept over a hundred *shi* of grain without distributing it. They were proud and arrogant, keeping their hair long and wearing leather shoes, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. In November last year, District cadre Wang Jianguo came to the village and discovered this situation. He talked to Hai Jin, the chairman of the village farmers' association: "If we are like this, will the masses dare to approach us? If we want to truly serve the masses, we must first put down this pretense." He advised Hai Jin to shave his head, but Hai Jin pointed to Wang Jianguo's head and said, "Why don't you shave yours?" Wang said, "I will shave it immediately." Hai Jin listened to this advice and shaved his head with the district cadre that same day. Then, a village cadre meeting was held to conduct self-criticism. The cadres all said with shame: "We were too selfish in the past. We must get rid of these problems in the future." Everyone unanimously proposed to perform meritorious service for the masses from now on. Immediately, they continued to cut off feudal remnants and distributed the accumulated gains. First, they absorbed representatives of the masses to participate in the evaluation. Those who had received more in the past received less this time, and those who had received less received more. The cadres who had received more in the past voluntarily proposed not to receive any this time. Comrade Jianguo also said to the village cadres: "The masses dare to speak up now, which is a result of your change in style." The masses all said: "The cadres have changed greatly now. This time, the distribution of gains is truly satisfactory, fair and reasonable." Cadres like Hai Jin also said happily: "More people mean higher wisdom, democracy is still good." One hundred and eighty households out of the entire village's two hundred and seventeen households received gains. Regarding the five middle peasant households who were wrongly struggled against, Hai Jin took the initiative to invite them to the farmers' association to openly criticize his own mistakes and compensate them for their losses. The middle peasants were very satisfied. The peasants throughout the village united to thoroughly liquidate the feudal exploitation of the sixteen households in the village, realizing "land to the tiller."

　　鲍村干部提高觉悟
    退出果实转变作风
    【本报太岳十九日电】长子五区鲍村，提出了“干部要为群众立功”的口号，改造了干部和工作。去年土地改革运动时，该村干部作风很不好，因报复私恨，误斗了五家中农，几个干部关住庙门分果实，不通过群众，好的自己多分，坏的就给了群众，还存下一百多石粮食也没分。留头发、穿皮鞋骄傲自大，引起群众不满。去年十一月，区干部王建国到村发现这种情形，就和村农会主席海金谈话：“像咱们这个样子，群众是否敢接近呢？我们要真正为群众服务，就要先把这个架子放下。”劝海金剃掉头发，海金就指王建国的头说：“为什么你不剃”？王说：“我也就马上剃去。”海金听了这番劝解，当天就和区干部一同把发剃去了。接着就召开了村干部会检讨，干部都惭愧的说：“过去自己太自私，以后这些毛病非改掉不行。”大家一致提出今后要为群众立功。随即继续割封建尾巴，并分配积存果实，先吸收群众代表参加评议，过去分多的少分，分少的多分。过去干部多分了，这次自动提出不分。建国同志并向村干部说：“群众敢说话了，是你们转变作风的结果。”群众都说：“现在干部大变了，这次果实分的真合心思，又公平又合理。”海金等干部也高兴的说：“人多主意高，还是民主好”。全村二百一十七户就有一百八十户分到果实。对那五家被误斗的中农，海金主动的把他们请到农会当面检讨了自己的错误，并补偿了他们的损失，中农很满意，全村农民团结起来彻底清算了本村十六户的封建剥削，实现了土地回家。
