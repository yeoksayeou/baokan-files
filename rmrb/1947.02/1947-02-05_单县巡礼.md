　　【This dispatch from the front lines of the Jilu-Yu region was reported by our newspaper's reporter Li Pu on the 2nd.】The city of Shan County in southwestern Shandong was recovered late at night on the 26th. This morning, the reporter entered the city for a tour. Most of the residents from the four gates had evacuated to the countryside during the fighting, but their news traveled fast, and they were already pushing their carts back. One elderly man insisted on pulling a cadre from the Eighth Route Army to his home for dumplings, recounting a bit of history: "When the democratic county government retreated on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month last year, the people asked to resist, but the comrades from the county government said, 'Let them come; we'll be back in a few months.' Just five months later, you really are back."

　　Entering the city from the west gate, the main direction of attack last night, the Eighth Route Army was cleaning up the bodies of the Chiang soldiers on the city walls and streets. Batches of prisoners walked by, some with cotton coats draped over them, some with white cloths wrapped around their heads, and some still wearing their American-style wide-brimmed hats, looking particularly limp and utterly pathetic. It was truly a sorry sight. A Chiang soldier claiming to be a supply sergeant was accompanied by a rather modern-looking female companion, and he had an old man carrying his four beautiful leather suitcases. A cadre from the Eighth Route Army had to tell him, "Friend, it is our policy to treat prisoners leniently, but you should know that you are not here as an official. Please carry some of it yourself!"

　　Personnel from the democratic county government opened the prison gates, and more than two hundred prisoners surged out, grabbing the hands of their liberators, unable to speak for a moment, only tears streaming down their gaunt faces. Among them were six children aged twelve to sixteen, members of the children's corps, and five members of the women's national salvation association. After a moment of silence, they began to speak. One farmers' association member said, "Catch the puppet county magistrate and Judge Wang; they must be handed over to us to deal with. We'll bite them to death, bite by bite!" A militiaman said, "Just wait until I get back; see how I'll deal with them!" A veteran of the Eighth Route Army, who had been imprisoned for over twenty days and suffered much torture, ran into the street and shouted, "If you hadn't come, I would have been buried alive!" The Chiang soldiers' puppet county government and the Home-Returning Corps had buried about four hundred civilians alive. A farmer who had just been released, not knowing from where, caught a fat man from the Home-Returning Corps, tied him up with a rope, and sent him to the democratic county government, shouting, "It's him, it's him who arrested me."

　　The entrance to the Catholic church was piled high with guns, cannons, and ammunition. Fang Xianjue was a direct descendant of Chiang Kai-shek, and his equipment was not bad. The victors were busily carrying these spoils of war. Three artillery shells hit the Chiang army headquarters, damaging the radio station. Father Ge, a German priest at the Catholic church, repeatedly praised the accuracy of the Eighth Route Army's artillery to the reporter. Piled on the desk at the Chiang army headquarters was a stack of receipts, the most numerous of which were vouchers from the regimental commander's mansion, stating that they had received a certain amount of canned beef and a certain amount of canned pork. It seemed he was very interested in these American canned goods. Empty cans were piled up in the corner of the courtyard. The American imperialists certainly took good care of Chiang Kai-shek!

　　单县巡礼
    李普
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】新华社记者李普报导：鲁西南单县城于二十六日深夜收复，记者清晨进城巡礼。四关的老百姓大部分在战争时疏散下乡，他们的消息真快，这时候又推着小车回来。有一个老年人，一定要拉一位八路军干部到他家里去吃饺子，他说了一段历史：“去年阴历八月初四，民主县政府撤退时，老百姓要求抵抗一下，县政府的同志说：‘让他来吧，用不了几个月我们就要回来的。’刚刚五个月，你们真的回来了。”记者从西关进城，这是昨晚的主攻方向，八路军正在收拾城墙上和街上的蒋军尸体，俘虏们一批一批的从街上走过，有的把棉袄披在身上，有的用白布包着头，有的仍旧带着美式宽边帽子，特别显得软塌塌的，狼狈不堪的样子，真是难看之至。有一个自称军需上士的蒋军，带着一位相当摩登的女眷，他的四只漂亮的皮箱，叫一位老百姓挑着。一位八路军的干部不得不告诉他：“朋友，优待俘虏是我们的政策，可是你总应该知道你不是来做官的，还是请你自己挑一挑吧！”民主县政府的人员打开监狱的栏栅两百多个囚犯一涌而出，抓住解放者的手，一时都说不出话来，只有眼泪从瘦得吓人的脸上流下。其中有六个十二岁至十六岁的小孩，他们是儿童团团员，还有五个妇女救国会的会员。沉默了一会，他们才开始说话，一个农会会员说：“抓住伪县长和王法官，一定要交给我们办，我们要一口一口咬他！”一个民兵说：“这回回去，你看我怎么干它！”一个八路军的复员战士被关了二十几天，受了许多苦刑，他跑到街上就喧嚷起来：“你们再不来，我就会被活埋了！”蒋军伪县政府和还乡团一共活埋了老百姓约四百人。一个农民刚刚释放出去，不知道从那里捉到一个还乡团的大胖子，用绳子捆着送到民主县政府，一面嚷着说：“就是他，就是他把我抓来的。”天主堂门口堆满了枪炮弹药，方先觉是蒋介石的嫡系，装备很不坏，胜利者正在忙碌的搬运这些战利品。蒋军指挥部中了三发炮弹，打坏了电台。天主堂的德籍葛神父连声向记者称赞八路军的大炮打得真准。蒋军指挥部的案子上堆着一堆单据，其中最多的是团长公馆的领条，上面写着领到牛肉罐头若干，猪肉罐头若干，看起来他对这些美国罐头很感兴趣、空罐头盒子堆满在院子的角落里，美国帝国主义者豢养蒋介石真是周到之至！
