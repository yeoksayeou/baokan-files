    Anyang Flying Demolition Squad
    Achieves Repeated Successes
    Turning Dead Mines into Live Mines to Attack the Enemy
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 9th] Since January, the flying demolition squads in Anyang have combined with small armed units to conduct in-depth demolitions behind enemy lines, fulfilling Taiwu's call to "turn dead mines into live mines" and "attack the enemy with mines." On the night of the 12th, Lin, the deputy political commissar of the Fourth District of Anyang, personally led more than 30 militiamen and a flying demolition team on an expedition to Xiatianzhu to suppress the activities of the "Homecoming Corps" (还乡团) and local bullies in the village. The "Homecoming Corps" resisted stubbornly from a high building. Under the cover of our firepower, the demolition team approached the high building and buried explosives and landmines to destroy the building, killing three enemies and wounding several others. The militia took advantage of the situation and charged forward, killing Han Shifu, the captain of the "Homecoming Corps" in the village. We returned safely. The county headquarters issued a special circular to commend them and awarded Comrade Lin, the deputy political commissar, and other leading comrades with first-class certificates of merit, and the demolition team with a second-class award of 20 catties of rice. Also, the demolition team of the Sixth District combined with the militia to attack Xupu, killing the special agent Han Tianqi, and then laid mines and returned. The next day, personnel from the puppet Xiu Public Office went to the office, and when they pushed open the door, they triggered a mine and were immediately blown to death. Several enemy puppets were killed. When transporting Han's body, they triggered another landmine under the body, and the enemy fled in panic, with unclear casualties. Other demolition teams, such as Lu Bingquan, Li Shuizhu, Zhang Xi from Shuiye, and Wang Jinhai from Guantai, have all achieved victories in demolitions behind enemy lines and have been rewarded by the county headquarters.
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 9th] Since Taiwu called for the development of the demolition movement in mid-November of last year, it has lasted for two months. The Taihang demolition war has now spread throughout the border areas and behind enemy lines of the entire region, greatly restricting the looting activities of the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops. In the border areas of Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Zanhuang, and Huolu counties in the First Military Sub-district, located in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the mass demolition movement is being promoted in conjunction with fortifications and tunnel warfare. In the Second Military Sub-district, located in the triangle area of Zhi (县) Tai (原) and Tongpu Railways, including Pingding, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Qi County, and other places, the widespread development of the demolition movement has created many favorable conditions for our local guerrilla corps to annihilate small armed units of Yan Xishan's puppet troops. Frequent small-scale battles in Taigu, Shouyang, and other places where the enemy is simply annihilated are examples of this. In the Third Military Sub-district, Anyang, Tangyin, Huixian, and other places, the mass base of the demolition war is particularly extensive. Moreover, in coordination with small "flying everywhere" armed units, flying demolitions and counter-liquidation struggles are carried out behind enemy lines, and landmines are often buried at the gates of the "Homecoming Corps" and treacherous landlords. The demolition teams of the Fourth Military Sub-district, which are active on the Luqianqing side and the Jiao (Zuo) Bo (Ai) highway, often blow up and intercept the enemy's transportation and supply vehicles, and seize their vehicles and livestock.

    屡建奇功
    变死雷为活雷以雷进攻敌人
    【本报太行九日电】元月以来，安阳各地飞行爆炸组结合小股武装，深入敌后开展爆炸，做到了太武“变死雷为活雷”，“以雷进攻敌人”的号召。十二日夜，安阳四区林副政委亲率民兵三十余人及飞行爆炸队远征下天助，镇压该村“还乡团”恶霸地主活动；“还乡团”据高楼顽抗，爆炸队在我火力掩护下，接近高楼，埋炸药地雷将楼炸毁，毙敌三人，伤数人。民兵乘势冲杀，击毙该村“还乡团”队长韩士付后。我安然返回。县指挥部特通令表扬，并奖给林副政委等领导同志以一等奖状，爆炸队以二等奖米二十斤。又六区爆炸队结合民兵袭击许朴，打死特务韩天起后，埋雷而回。次日伪休公所人员赴所办公，推门触雷立被炸毙，敌伪数人，搬运韩尸时，又触尸下地雷，敌仓惶逃命，伤亡未明。其他如水冶吕炳全、李水珠、张喜及观台王金海等爆炸队，均深入敌后爆炸获胜，先后受县指挥部奖励。
    【本报太行九日电】自去年十一月中旬，太武号召开展爆炸运动后，历时两月。太行爆炸战，现已遍及全区边地敌后，大大限制了蒋阎军之抢掠活动。位于平汉北段一分区之元氏、高邑、赞皇、获鹿等县边地，群众爆炸运动，正随着工事、地道战相辅推进。地处止太同蒲三角地带二分区之平定、寿阳、榆次、太谷、祁县等地，由于爆炸运动之普遍开展，给我地方游击兵团歼灭阎伪小股武装，造下不少有利条件。太谷、寿阳等地经常有干脆歼敌的小型战斗，即为例证。三分区安阳、汤阴、辉县等地之爆炸战，群众基础尤为广泛。且配合“满天飞”小型武装，在敌后展开飞行爆炸及反倒算斗争，地雷掩埋在“还乡团”和奸霸地主大门上，尤为常事。四分区活跃于路迁清侧及焦（作）博（爱）公路上的爆炸队时，常爆炸、截击，伪军之运输补给车辆，并缴获其车辆牲口。
