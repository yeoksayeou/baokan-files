    The Coal-Saving Method of Xu Chengzhi, Our Newspaper's Model of Thrift
    Xu Chengzhi, a model of coal conservation, while sick, sat idly in a villager's tofu workshop. He noticed that the big fire used to boil soybean milk produced very clean coal ash, with no waste at all. He thought, "I must make up my mind to eliminate all the waste I have made in the past and become a model of thrift." So he asked the villager in detail and carefully studied the method. After recovering from his illness, he used the method he had researched in practice, and the result was a saving of one-third of the coal. Previously, when the cooks were burning the fire, they put the charcoal in the fire, and a very high chimney was installed behind the stove. The fire would naturally burn with the suction of the chimney, but it would never burn through completely, and a lot of crushed coal powder would remain in the coal ash (leaking from the fire into the ash pit). This crushed coal powder could not be used.
    The saving method he researched was to use bellows to fan the fire, stopping when not needed, and the fire would naturally become smaller. When charcoal briquettes could not be bought, crushed coal was mixed with water and added to the fire. When the fire was no longer hot enough, it was taken out. After removing the burnt waste that could not be used from the fire, the remaining crushed coal and second-grade charcoal, plus half good coal, were mixed with water and added to the fire. This time it could be burned through completely. Because the second-grade charcoal and good coal, once burned, would be refined into large pieces of coal ash, no more crushed coal powder would leak down. Although the flame of the second burning was not as large as the first, the heat was still very strong, and the choking coal gas was reduced. The cooking fire for more than 100 people used to require 15 jin of coal per meal to cook the dishes, but now only 10 jin are needed.

    本报节约模范徐成志的烧煤节省法
    节约煤炭模范徐成志，他在病中到老乡豆腐房里闲坐，看见人家熬豆浆用的大火，烧出来的煤渣很干净，一点也不浪费。他就想：我一定要下决心，把过去浪费的现象取消尽，作一个节约模范。于是他就详细的问了老乡，自己又细心的研究了一下。病好后，他用研究出的方法实地试用，结果可以节省三分之一的煤炭。从前炊事员们烧火时，是把炭放在火里，火台背后安一很高的火筒，用火筒的吸引力，那火自然就烧起来了，但是总烧不透，煤渣里留有很多的碎煤面，（从火上漏在煤渣坑里的）这些碎煤面就不能用了。
    他研究出的节省办法是用风箱扇火，不用时停扇，火自然就小了。买不到炭块的时候，是把碎煤用水拌搅，添在火里。等到烧的没有火力的时候就捐出来，除去火中烧透不能用的废渣后，把剩下的碎煤和二炭再加上一半好煤，用水和起来添进火里，这一次就能烧透了。因为二炭和好煤一烧就炼成大块煤渣也不会再漏下碎煤面了。第二次烧虽然火焰不如第一次大，但火力仍然很强，更减少了熏人的煤气。一百多人食用的炒菜火，从前一顿须用十五斤煤才能炒熟，现在只用十斤就行了。
