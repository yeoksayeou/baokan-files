　　[This Dispatch from Taihang, dated the 23rd] In order to ensure a steady flow of coal shipments from Xiyang, the three counties of Xi (yang), Shou (yang), and Ping (ding) have specially established a joint coal station in Zhanshang Town, Xiyang, with a capital of 300,000. It was also decided to set up branch stations in Songta Town, Pingding, and Dasaikou, Xiyang, to shorten the coal transportation distance. Xiyang also decided to organize the masses to burn charcoal, under the principle of not affecting the mountain forests, as a way for the masses to increase their income from return trips and reduce coal transportation costs.
