Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, February 26th: After the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated seven divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the area north of Laiwu, it seized the opportunity to recover Boshan County, the terminus of the Zhangdian-Boshan branch line of the Jiaoji Railway, on the 24th. Boshan is famous throughout the country for its coal mines, magnetic industry, and glass industry. In the mining area along the Zichuan-Boshan border, there are more than 100,000 workers. The city has several large power plants and is one of Shandong's modern cities. The city was first liberated from the enemy and puppets by the Eighth Route Army on August 23, 1945. Since then, it has changed hands three times. Chiang Kai-shek's troops invaded and occupied the city on July 10 last year. This is the fourth liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, February 26th: A certain unit of the Bohai Eighth Route Army, in coordination with local militia, launched a full-scale sabotage of the Jiaoji Railway, the lifeline of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, on the 20th evening, stretching over 200 li from Changyi in the east to Wangsherenzhuang in the west. Currently, the section west of Yangjiazhuang, west of Jinan to Zhoucun, is impassable.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, February 26th: On the afternoon of the 23rd, the People's Liberation Army on the Laiwu front shot down a Chiang Kai-shek plane that was assisting in the battle. The pilot, Zhang Yilun of the Third Aviation Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's army, was killed upon crashing to the ground.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, February 26th: For strategic needs, the People's Liberation Army on the Lunan front proactively withdrew from the county seat, Zaozhuang, and Shengxian County successively on the 17th, 18th, and 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, February 26th: The 166th Division of the Eighth Army, Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage, which had entrenched itself in Yexian County, Jiaodong, was largely annihilated by the Eighth Route Army while fleeing westward from Kecheng. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops fled from Kecheng to Shahe Town, more than 20 li southwest of Yexian County, on the morning of the 18th, they were immediately intercepted and surrounded by the Eighth Route Army. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops launched several fierce attacks to no avail. On the afternoon of the 13th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops, under the cover of aircraft, broke through in several directions, but before they could advance two li, the Eighth Route Army completely wiped out their 498th Regiment, and then took advantage of the victory to sweep away the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek troops. Currently, more than 40 strongholds, large and small, including Yexian County and Shahe Town, and 200,000 people have regained liberation. In this battle, according to incomplete statistics, more than 800 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander of the 498th Regiment of the 166th Division of the Eighth Army, were captured, more than 2,500 were killed or wounded, and 118 light and heavy machine guns and more than 150 submachine guns were seized, and one Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down.

    【新华社华东前线二十六日电】华东人民解放军于莱芜以北地区歼灭蒋军七个师后，复乘胜于二十四日收复胶济路张店博山支路终点博山县城。按博山以煤矿、磁业、玻璃业驰名全国，在淄（川）博（山）边界一带矿区，有工人十余万。城内有大发电厂数处，为山东近代化城市之一。该城系一九四五年八月二十三日第一次为八路军自敌伪手中所解放，此后曾三易其手，去年七月十日蒋军侵陷该城，此次为第四次解放。
    【新华社山东二十六日电】渤海八路军某部配合当地民兵，于二十日晚对东起昌乐，西迄王舍人庄，长达二百余里的蒋军内战动脉的胶济铁路展开全面破击，现济南至周村以西之杨家庄，已不能通车。
