Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 22nd: Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to sell UNRRA supplies worth 200 million US dollars on the black market has, in effect, been confirmed by the official statement of UNRRA Director Rooks. According to the US Information Service in Washington: Rooks stated that UNRRA still has machinery and other materials awaiting shipment to China. The Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) proposes to exchange them for cotton and wheat worth 200 million US dollars to be shipped to China for use. The Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) believes that the stimulating effect of such basic supplies on China's (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) economy and currency system would be greater than the current UNRRA plan. Rooks stated that this request would be submitted to the Liaison Central Committee for study as one of various options. Regarding the Chiang government's request to sell supplies on the black market, Rooks stated: "The rumor that the Chinese side proposed to allow the sale of UNRRA supplies on the black market is 'absolutely false.' The Chinese side has stated that UNRRA should allow grain to be sold in the 'free market' (i.e., the black market), but in view of the lack of a rationing system and price controls, UNRRA has always refused." Prior to Rooks' statement, the United Press disclosed this news, and the New York Evening Post commented that this action was a greedy theft of funds due to the people by the Chiang Kai-shek government, proving its political and spiritual bankruptcy. The Chiang government denied the United Press report. On the 19th, Soong Tzu-wen "absolutely denied" this claim to reporters from the Central News Agency in Shanghai, considering the report to be completely unfounded. Huo Baoshu, Director of the Chiang government's Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), even on the 20th, still "firmly denied the United Press report" through the Central News Agency, even saying that "Half of the UNRRA supplies to China have already arrived, and the number of those not yet shipped is only 40 to 50 million US dollars. If 100 to 200 million US dollars of relief supplies were sold, it is not known where the remaining insufficient supplies would come from." After Rooks' official statement was published, Chiang government officials in the United States were very embarrassed and had no way to deny it. According to a Central News Agency report: Zheng Baonan, director of the Chinese (referring to the Chiang government) CRRRA office in Washington, said that Rooks' statement that China had "hinted" (note: according to the US Information Service translation, it should be "stated") that it wanted to sell food on the "free market" was a mistake. Zheng was supported by his Chinese officials.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 22nd: According to United Press and Central News Agency reports on the 21st: The Kuomintang authorities' request to UNRRA to change its 200 million US dollar relief plan for China into goods that could be sold on the black market in China has been further confirmed by various parties. Sources close to UNRRA in Washington said that Director Rooks of the Liaison Office stated in his report to the Liaison Central Committee that UNRRA and the Kuomintang authorities had already discussed the Kuomintang's construction industry. However, it was also stated that "Most of the above-mentioned 200 million US dollars has been used to order supplies, and this amount can no longer be used. Only the 49 million US dollars that have not yet been ordered can be used for any purpose." Chiang government's ambassador to the United States, Zhang Bojun, has appealed to the UNRRA Central Committee to immediately consider the Kuomintang authorities' request to replace the original plan's industrial machinery with cotton and other major consumer goods. United Press reporter Rundel reported from Shanghai on the 20th: An UNRRA senior official commented on the matter, pointing out that regardless of whether you call the Chinese market a "free market" or a "black market," the fact is that the Kuomintang's request is to use the funds given to it for thoroughly non-relief purposes to support the Nanjing Kuomintang regime. Rundel said that this matter has caused widespread anger. Rundel also quoted UNRRA sources as revealing that when UNRRA discovered that a large percentage of cotton and cloth made from UNRRA cotton was used as Kuomintang military uniforms, UNRRA had to intervene. After this fact was revealed, the Kuomintang authorities were angered and instigated CRRRA to file a protest with UNRRA Deputy Director Eggerton on February 1, demanding the punishment of the UNRRA personnel who leaked the information, and officially issued a statement from the UNRRA China Office, expressing "great indignation" at this kind of random remarks.

　　联总署长鲁克斯证实
    蒋介石盗卖救济物资
    棉花布匹竟用作军服
    【新华社延安二十二日电】蒋介石拟请准将价值二万万美元之联总物资在黑市出售一事，实际上已为联总署长鲁克斯之正式声明所证实。据美国新闻处华府讯：鲁克斯声明中称，目前联总尚有机器等物资留待运华，中国政府（按指蒋政府）拟请易以价值二万万美元之棉花与小麦运华应用。中国政府（指蒋政府）认为此类性质之基本供应品，其在中国（指蒋管区）经济及币制方面可能引起之鼓励作用，实较目前联总计划为甚。鲁氏称：该项请求，将作为各种方案之一种提交联络中央委员会研究。关于蒋政府请求将物资出售黑市一节，鲁氏称：“外传中国方面拟请准许在黑市销售联总物资一节，‘绝无其事’。中国方面曾表示，联总应准许粮食在‘自由市场’（按即黑市）中销售，但鉴于配给制度及物价管制之缺乏，联总始终予以拒绝。”按在鲁克斯声明之前数日，合众社即披露是项消息，纽约下午报评论此举乃蒋介石政府对人民应得的款项之贪婪的盗窃，证明其政治上及精神上均已破产。对合众社之报导，蒋政府曾加以矢口否认，宋子文十九日在沪对中央社记者“绝对否认”此说，认为此项报导完全无据。蒋政府行总署长霍宝树甚至在二十日，仍经过中央社“坚决否认合众社之报导”，竟谓“联总予华物资，业已至半运华，现尚未运华者，其数目仅四五千万美元，若在一二亿美元救济物资出售，其余不足的之物资，实不知从何而来”。鲁克斯正式声明发表后，在美的蒋政府官员甚为狼狈，而尚无抵赖。据中央社电称：中国（指蒋政府）行总驻华盛顿办事处主任郑宝南称，鲁克斯谓中国曾“暗示”（按：据美国新闻处之译文应为“表示”）要在“自由市场”出售食物，乃系错误。郑氏受其中国官吏之支持。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据合众社中央社二十一日消息：国民党当局要求联总让其对华二万万美元救济计划，改为在中国黑市可以销售之货物一事，续为各方所证实。华盛顿方面接近联总人士谓：联络署长鲁克斯于联络中央委员会之报告中，谓联总与国民党当局对国民党建设业已加以讨论。不过同时说明“上述二亿美元中，多半已用以定购物资，该笔款项业已不能再行动用，唯尚未定货之四千九百万美元，尚可从事任何用途。”蒋政府驻美大使章伯钧已吁请联总中央委员会，立即考虑国民党当局将棉花及其他主要消费品代替原计划中工业机器之请求。合众社记者伦德尔二十日自上海报导：联总某高级职员评论此事时，指出不管你叫中国市场为“自由市场”或“黑市市场”，事实是国民党此项要求，是将给它的款项用于彻头彻尾的非救济目的，以支持南京国民党政权。伦德尔称：此事已引起广泛激怒。伦德尔同时引证联总方面人士透露消息称：联总当发现很大百分率的棉花及由联总棉花制成的布匹用作国民党之军服时，联总就不得不加以干涉。此项事实被揭露后，国民党当局恼羞成怒，曾唆使行总于二月一日向联总分署长艾格顿提出抗议，要求处分透露消息之联总人员，并由联总中国办事处正式发表声明，对此种随意发言，表示“甚为愤慨”云。
