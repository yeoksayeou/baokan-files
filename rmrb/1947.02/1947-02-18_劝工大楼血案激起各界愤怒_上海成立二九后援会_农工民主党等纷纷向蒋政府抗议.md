Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai, 12th: Since the Quanggong Building atrocity, public sentiment in Shanghai has been extraordinarily indignant. Various people's organizations have formed the "February 9th Massacre Support Association," which will issue a formal statement refuting Wu Guozhen's lies. The Shanghai Workers' Association, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (i.e., the Third Party), and others have all formally issued statements expressing their indignation and protest, and vowing to support the victims of the bloody incident. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, sent a telegram from Hong Kong to express his condolences. The "Preparatory Committee for Loving National Products and Resisting American Goods" published a letter to compatriots across the country, condemning the crimes of Kuomintang secret agents, and stating: "Even if this association suffers such cruel persecution, we will never give up halfway; as long as we have a breath left, this determination will not change." Citizens enthusiastically donated money to encourage the injured and deceased in the Quanggong Building incident. The "Liang Renda Funeral Committee" received over 3.78 million yuan from Puyi in one day.
