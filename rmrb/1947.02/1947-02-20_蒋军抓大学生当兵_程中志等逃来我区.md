　　Chiang Kai-shek's Army Seizes University Students as Soldiers
    Cheng Zhongzhi and Others Flee to Our Area
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 17th] On the 4th of this month, Cheng Zhongzhi, clerk of the 2nd Battalion of the 115th Regiment of the 9th Brigade of the enemy 40th Division stationed in Lunzhang, Anyang, and Lu Hanhun, a soldier of the 2nd District of the battalion, fled to our area at night. Cheng is from Anhui and a graduate of Jiaotong University. Last November, he was detained by the 40th Division in Anyang while en route to Beiping. On November 16th, he was sent to the Xinbing Camp in Guantai. Later, due to his frail health, he was transferred to the battalion headquarters of the 2nd Battalion as a clerk. Lu Hanhun is from Hanchuan, Hubei. Last November, he went to Anyang to visit relatives and was seized and conscripted at the same time as Cheng. After the two fled to the Liberated Area, they were warmly received by the democratic government and the masses and were extremely moved. When Cheng spoke of the rampant conscription of soldiers and the persecution of intellectuals by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, he said, "In Chiang's controlled areas, even the most basic social order no longer exists today." Lu Hanhun said, "When fighting the Japanese, I wanted to fight to my heart's content, but Chiang Kai-shek never issued a clear order to fight. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he resolutely opposed his own people. Of course, I will not be Chiang Kai-shek's scapegoat." They also expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the democratic construction work in the Liberated Area.

　　蒋军抓大学生当兵
    程中志等逃来我区
    【本报太行十七日电】本月四日，驻安阳伦掌敌四十师九旅一一五团二营文书程中志及该营二区兵卢汉魂，乘夜逃来我等。程系安徽人，交通大学毕业，去年十一月于赴平途中，被四十师在安阳扣押，十一月十六日送观台入新兵营，后因身体孱弱，调二营营部任文书。卢汉魂湖北汉川人，去年十一月赴安阳省亲，与程同时被抓当兵。两人逃来解放区后，倍受民主政府及群众热烈招待，极为感动。程谈及蒋伪抓兵横行及对文人的摧残时说：“蒋管区的天下，今日连最低限度的社会秩序也不存在了。”卢汉魂说：“打日本时，咱想痛痛快快干一下，可是蒋介石总没有响响亮亮的下个打的命令，抗日战争胜利后，反对待自己人坚决起来，当然我是不当蒋介石的送死鬼了。”他们并表示愿献身于解放区民主建设工作。
