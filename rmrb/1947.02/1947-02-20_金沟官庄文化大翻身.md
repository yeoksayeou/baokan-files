　　The Great Cultural Leap Forward in Jingou Guanzhuang
    Li Xihui · Xu Jun
    Jingou Guanzhuang, a village in Junan County, Shandong Province, with 160 households and a population of 741, has undergone a great cultural leap forward under the leadership of the democratic government. The blackboard newspaper is crowded with people all day long. In the past year, more than 40 people have contributed to the blackboard newspaper, 43 people have read newspapers, and almost every young man, woman, and child can write letters and travel permits. Recalling the situation under the rule of the Kuomintang government ten years ago, only a dozen or so sons of rich peasants and landlords attended private schools. Among people over the age of 30, only five were literate, and only two of them could do arithmetic. At that time, an interesting story happened: Dong Xuewen, an illiterate peasant, pasted the couplet "May the livestock flourish" on the head of his bed and "Head of the household" on the cowshed during the Spring Festival. Now, this liberated village has produced a "new champion," Ji Shifu, who is a model for youth learning in Junan and is leading the people of the village out of the bitter sea of hunger and poverty. He also developed a strong demand for culture. Without books or fixed teachers, he memorized the slogans on the walls and the words in the newspapers, and asked literate people when he met them. He quickly learned more than 400 characters. Ji Shifu also promoted the benefits of literacy everywhere. At first, he met many obstacles, and people replied, "What does it matter to you whether I learn or not?" However, one person cannot withstand the crowd's words, and a tree cannot withstand a hundred axes. Finally, a literacy group was established, setting off a village-wide movement of hard study. Every household wrote "Good combination of production and learning, culture must be improved" on their doors, and the main street was marked with slogans such as "Don't forget to study while eating, don't forget to produce while studying." Some people wrote characters on the handlebars of their carts when carrying manure, reciting them as they walked; when harvesting crops, they carved characters on the handles of their sickles or wrote them on their legs. When weeding, Ji Shifu wrote characters on his stomach, reading as he hoed. Some people even practiced the method of drawing on the ground during the day and drawing on their stomachs at night for hard study. Under the upsurge of self-study and hard study by young men and women, the culture of the whole village has greatly improved. Now they have put forward a new slogan: Take learning and culture a step further and strive to become a cultural model.

　　金沟官庄文化大翻身
    李西恚·徐军
    金沟官庄，是山东莒南县一个一百六十户人家、七百四十一口人的村庄，在民主政府领导下，全庄文化大翻身。黑板报跟前，整日都拥挤着人。过去一年，为黑板报写稿的，有四十多名，读报纸的有四十三人，而写信、路条等，几乎每个男女青年和儿童都会。回忆一下十年前国民党政府统治的情况，那时全庄只有十二、三个富农地主子弟上私塾，三十岁以上的人共有五个人识字，而其中会算的才二人。当时曾发生过一件有趣的故事：一个不识字的农民董学文，过年贴对联，把“槽头兴旺”贴在自己睡觉的床头上，把“一家之主”贴到牛棚里了。现在，这个解放了的村庄，出了个“新状元”纪石福，他是莒南的青年学习模范，领着全庄人民走出饥饿贫穷的苦海。又对文化发生了强烈的要求，没有书，也没有固定的老师，碰到墙上的标语和报纸上的字就记，遇见识字的人就问，很快就识了四百多字。纪石福又到处宣传识字的好处，起先，他碰了不少人的钉子，人家回答是：“我学不学管你什么事？”可是，人担不住众语，树担不住百斧，终于识字小组建立了，掀起了全村苦学运动。每家门前都写着“生产学习结合好，文化要提高”，大街上写着“吃饭不忘学习，学习不忘生产”的标语。有些人推粪时，把字写在车把上，一边走，一边念，割庄稼时，把字刻写在镰把下，写在自己的腿上；锄草时，纪石福把字写在肚皮上，一面锄，一面读，还有的人实行白天划地皮，晚上划肚皮的苦学方法。在青年男女的自学苦学热潮下，全庄人民的文化大大提高了，现在他们又提出了新的口号：把学习和文化提高一步，争取文化模范。
