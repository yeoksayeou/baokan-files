How the Stable Mobilized Backward Peasants

　　In Ma Jiayu Village, Zuoquan, when the district proposed "cutting off tails and filling holes," the village cadres had similar thoughts, believing that the task could be completed in three to five days. After returning to the village, without ideological mobilization and serious inspection, they simply entered the struggle to cut off tails. In the struggle, only the activists and cadres did the work, while the silent ones sat in the back smoking, adopting a bystander attitude. District cadres and resident agency cadres suggested to the village cadres: "We should face the backward." Most village cadres felt that facing the backward was troublesome and wasted time. Some said, "Backward people didn't become backward in a day or two"; others said, "They can't be mobilized in a lifetime." The district cadres mobilized again before they reluctantly did it.

　　When starting the mobilization, it was determined that each activist would guarantee that two backward elements would speak, but they didn't touch their sore spots, only asking bluntly: "Why don't you speak? Don't you have any suffering?" The backward elements said: "We don't have any suffering." Some said: "I worked as a long-term laborer and suffered feudal exploitation." The activists felt that the mention was too general and immediately rejected it. Another method was for cadres to divide the work and convene meetings of backward elements in each area, talking about how the fruits were our blood and sweat, and that it was right to fight landlords, etc., from morning to night without sleeping, talking for several days. They all thought that the masses' thinking was clear, but unexpectedly, during the struggle, these people were just as silent as before, not caring about anything, still sitting in the back smoking.

　　After the meeting, cadres and activists discussed again. Some said: "I knew they wouldn't speak," others said: "It's really a waste of work." Finally, they unanimously decided to first find those who clearly had suffering but didn't complain, and individually conduct "suffering visits." First, they mobilized the hired worker Zhao De'ai, asking "Do you have any suffering?" He said, "I don't have anything." They then enlightened him: "You worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord Li Cunjiu, didn't you suffer?" He said, "I worked as a long-term laborer for him because I didn't have land. Besides, I ate cooked food and earned raw food from him, so I should endure it?" Finally, they asked him: "How did your feet get frostbitten?" This question excited him, and he began to tell everyone about his suffering. He said, "Speaking of my feet, I remember when I twisted my leg carrying grain for the landlord's family. It hurt so much that I couldn't walk. I leaned on a carrying pole, but the shopkeeper scolded me, fearing that it would damage his carrying pole tip. He didn't care about my leg pain. Thinking about it, a poor person is really not as good as the landlord's carrying pole. My leg hurt so badly that I couldn't rest, so I went to thresh hemp for him. Wearing shoes, I was scolded again, because my shoes were too hard and crushed his hemp seeds. I had to take off my shoes and thresh hemp in the cold dirt yard all day long. Since then, both of my feet have been constantly hurting. Even then, he didn't care about me at all, and forced me to soak hemp stalks in cold water. I really couldn't stand the cold, and lost my job." The activists further enlightened his hatred: "Everyone in Ma Jiayu knows that the landlord Li Cunjiu's donkey refuses to carry coal in the summer. Donkeys really live better than poor people." Finally, De'ai realized and decided to fight the landlord. He was then asked to mobilize others. Influenced by his complaints, many people spoke their minds: "Now we know, we must fight the damned landlord to the end." During this process, the landlord also took advantage of loopholes to confuse the backward elements. The landlord Hou Gengzi said: "Don't be fooled by the cadres. When we had things, the cadres didn't let you speak, but now that we don't have things, they want you to stir up trouble." This kind of activity made some backward elements stop mentioning it. For example, Niu Fuxiu was spat on by the landlord Zhao Sanwu. Everyone knew it was a pain in his heart, so they mobilized him to complain to the landlord. He said: "It's been so many years, it's not worth any money, why bother stirring up trouble?" At this time, the cadres put forward the slogan "Return grain for grain" and "Return rice for rice." You were spat on in public for no reason in the past. Although it didn't hurt, it was shameful and disheartening. Now, although it can't be counted as money, you should vent your anger. He finally understood. Influenced by his complaints, many honest peasants who had been bullied but hadn't spoken up launched a struggle against the landlords. Zhao Baoheng was forced to work as a long-term laborer because the landlord Hou Gengzi took seven mu of his flat land. At first, he never mentioned it because he was a cousin of Hou. This time, he not only complained, but also angrily ran to beat his cousin. From then on, the honest peasants in Ma Jiayu who didn't speak all spoke up. Cadres and activists said: "These backward people all had suffering, but we didn't help them well." After such mobilization, people who didn't speak carried out a powerful reasoning struggle against the landlords, and many honest peasants, such as Li Chang, who hid millet and cattle for the landlord Li Cunjiu, and Li Sansan, who saved oil, also automatically reported to the farmers' association. The relationship between cadres and the masses was much more harmonious than before the mobilization. Previously, when cadres had problems in their work, the masses just grumbled behind their backs. Now, they can kindly point out the shortcomings of the cadres. Cadres and activists deeply felt that: facing the backward can completely eliminate feudalism and truly achieve unity of all peasants.

### 马厩是如何发动落后农民的

　　马厩是如何发动落后农民的
    左权马厩村，在区上提出“割尾巴，填窟窿”时，村干部都有着差不多思想，认为三五天就能完成任务。回村后，没有经过思想发动和认真检查，就简单进入割尾巴斗争。在斗争中，仍是积极分子和干部独干，不吭气的后边坐着抽烟，采旁观态度。区干部和驻村机关干部给村干部提议说：“应该面向落后。”大部村干部嫌面向落后麻烦，误时间。有的说：“落后人并不是一天两日才落了后”；有的说：“一辈子也发动不起来。”区干部又作动员，才勉强去做。
    开始发动时，确定每个积极分子保证两个落后分子说话，并没摸着他们心病，只硬问：“你们为啥不说话，你就没有苦？”落后分子说：“咱也没什苦。”有的说：“我住过长工受过封建剥削。”积极分子嫌提的笼统，马上给碰回去了。另一种干法是干部分工召集各片落后分子开会，讲果实是我们的血汗，斗地主是应该的等，从早到晚半夜不睡觉，讲了好几天，都以为群众思想闹通了，不料斗争时，这些人和以前一样不吭气，不管事，仍是坐在后边吸烟。
    会后干部积极分子又重行讨论，有的说：“我就知道人家不吭，”有的说：“真是白误工。”最后一致决定先找明知他有苦不诉的人，个别的去进行“访痛苦”。首先动员雇工赵德爱，问问“有苦没苦？”他说：“咱也没有什”，又启发他：“你给地主李存九做长工，受罪不受罪？”他说：“咱给人家做长工，是怨咱没地，再说吃上人家熟的，赚上人家生的，不好好受就行啦？”最后问了他一句“你的脚怎样冻坏了？”这一问才激动了他，便向大家诉起苦来，他说：“说起脚来就想起给人地主家担谷扭了腿，疼的不能走路，柱了一柱扁担，掌柜见了骂了咱一顿，怕坏了人家扁担尖，咱腿疼人家却不管。想起来咱一个穷人真还不如人家地主一根扁担。腿疼的没办法，不能歇，又给人家去打麻子，穿着鞋，又被掌柜训教了一顿，嫌咱穿的鞋硬，踏碎人家的麻子；只好把鞋脱了，赤着脚在冷土场里打了一天麻，自此两双脚便不断的疼了起来。就这人家也不心疼咱一点，还逼着下冷水里沤麻杆，实在冻的下不去，从此失去了饭碗。”积极分子更进一步启发了他的仇恨：“咱马厩谁不知道人家地主李存九家驴，一到夏天就不肯叫驮煤了，驴真比穷人好活的多呢。”最后德爱觉悟了，决心要和地主干，又让他去动员别人。在他的诉苦影响下有不少人都说了真心话：“这一下咱就知道啦，非和狗日地主斗到底不可。”在这当中，地主又钻空子，迷惑落后分子，地主侯更子说：“你们就不要上干部们当，俺们有东西时，人家干部不让你们说话，现在没东西了，又叫你们瞎惹人哩。”这样一活动便有些落后分子不提了。又如牛福秀被地主赵三五唾过一面，大家都知道是他心里一块病动员他向地主诉苦，他说：“事情已经多少年啦，也算不上人家钱，何必白惹人呢？”这时干部们便提出“吃谷还谷”“吃米还米”的口号，过去无故被他当众唾了你，虽然不痛，可是丢人败兴哩，现在虽不能算钱，气也该出一出。他这才想通了。在他诉苦影响下，不少受过气没说话的老实农民，都向地主展开斗争。赵保恒因被地主侯更子下了七亩平地，逼的住了长工，起先他因与侯是表弟关系，永不肯提，这次不但诉了苦，而且激愤地跑去打了他表哥。从此马厩不吭气的老实农民都说了话。干部积极分子说：“这些落后人，原来都有苦，是咱们没好好去帮助呀。”经过这样发动，不说话的人向地主进行了有力的说理斗争，还有不少老实农民，如李长把给地主李存九隐藏的小米毛牛，李三三给保存的油，也都自动报给农会。干部与群众关系较未发动前融洽的多了。以前干部在工作中有毛病，群众只是在背后圪噪，现在干部有缺点都能善意的提出，干部和积极分子才深深感到：面向落后，就能彻底消灭封建，真正达到团结全体农民。
