　　[Our Newspaper Weixian Dispatch, 1st] Based on the Central Bureau's instructions to the Jinnan District Party Committee, Jixian focused on Zaoyuan, Zengjia Village, and Houguo Village in the Fourth District for in-depth and specific investigation. It was discovered that many feudal landlords had not been eliminated, and the land issue for peasants had not been thoroughly resolved. The county leadership has now decided to conduct another inspection, promote a "filling in the gaps" campaign, and strive to completely eliminate feudalism and complete land reform. Before land reform, Zaoyuan Village had six landlord households, with eleven people, and 326.5 mu of land, averaging 29.7 mu per person. After the reform, five households still maintained their landlord status, one household was reduced to middle peasant, and a total of 150.7 mu of land remained, averaging 13.7 mu per person. Among them, Zhang Xinwang's family of one (working outside) still had 29.5 mu of land, Zhang Xinxing, one person (also working outside), still had 16 mu of land, and the Zhang Xincheng and Zhang Zanqi families each had more than 16 mu. Before the mass movement, the village had nine rich peasant households, with a total of 54 people, and 497 mu of land, averaging 9.2 mu per person. After the mass movement, they still had 342.2 mu of land, averaging 6.3 mu per person. Among them, six households maintained their rich peasant status, with each person having more than 7 mu of land, two households were reduced to prosperous middle peasants, and one household was reduced to rich middle peasant. Before the mass movement, the village had 102 middle peasant households, with 508 people, and 2743.7 mu of land, averaging 5.4 mu per person. There was no change after the mass movement. Before the mass movement, there were 181 poor peasant households, with 545 people, and 1508.5 mu of land, averaging 2.76 mu per person. After the mass movement, their status did not change, but their land increased to 1726.9 mu, averaging 3.2 mu per person (including some saline-alkali land not converted). The five destitute households, with fifteen people, had a total of 5.4 mu of land before the mass movement; now each person has been supplemented to 1.8 mu. Before the mass movement, the three landlord households in Zengjia Village remained unchanged in status. Before the struggle, they had 173.5 mu of land, averaging 11.6 mu per person. After the struggle, their land decreased to 111.9 mu, averaging 7.5 mu per person. Among them, Li Shu'en, a woman (with five family members working outside, but owning a cloth shop), originally had 30.8 mu of land. After donating 10 mu, she still had 21.8 mu. In addition, one household still had an average of 6 mu per person, and another household still had 7.7 mu per person, still relying on sharecropping or hired labor. Before the struggle, there were twelve rich peasant households, with 71 people, and 509.7 mu of land, averaging 7.1 mu per person. After the mass movement, they had 413.2 mu of land, averaging 5.8 mu per person. Among them, the status of five households remained unchanged, six households were reduced to prosperous middle peasants, and one household was reduced to middle peasant. Before the mass movement, there were 33 prosperous middle peasant households, with 123 people, and 855.9 mu of land, averaging 7 mu per person. There was no change in status after the mass movement. Before the struggle, there were 56 middle peasant households, with 184 people, and 736.3 mu of land, averaging 4 mu per person. There was no change after the struggle. Before the mass movement, there were 81 poor peasant households, with 266 people, and 454.5 mu of land, averaging 7.1 fen per person (Note: there should be 1.7 mu per person); after the mass movement, their land increased to 583.7 mu, averaging 2.2 mu per person. Only five military dependents households were supplemented with 3 mu of land per person, rising to the level of middle peasants. Before the struggle, there were 19 destitute households, with 37 people, and no land. After the struggle, except for one military dependents household supplemented with 3 mu per person, the rest were supplemented with 2 mu each, totaling 77.5 mu of land. Before the struggle, landlord Song Jinlu in Houguo Village had 60 mu of land, with six people. After the struggle, he still had 40 mu of land, with four people. Before the struggle, landlord Song Laoxiao had 55 mu of land, with five people. After the struggle, his land remained untouched. Only the feudal exploitation of landlord Song Changke's household was completely eliminated. Among the four rich peasant households who were struggled against or donated land, they originally had 223 mu of land, with 25 people. They donated a total of 15 mu, and later 10.5 mu were returned. The destitute peasants in the village were only supplemented with 2.18 mu per person, but there were still six households with less than 1 mu per person. The Fourth District was originally considered by county and district cadres to be the best land reform area in the old liberated areas, and Zaoyuan and Houguo Villages were the advanced villages in the Fourth District. Since last October, they have been fully engaged in mobilizing the masses, and a second check and reduction was carried out in December. The county committee was preparing to quickly shift to large-scale production. However, after conducting in-depth investigations with these three villages as the focus, it was discovered that land reform was still not thorough, and a new filling in the gaps campaign is now underway.
    [Our Newspaper Weixian Dispatch, 1st] On January 20th, the Nanguan Township of Yaoshan County convened a joint meeting of the Farmers' Association and the Women's Association to review the past emancipation struggle. From the reports of the group leaders, the following problems were discovered: 1. When struggling against the landlord Li Laozhen in West Street, a certain cadre shielded him, telling the masses to return things, saying that the Women's Association was deceiving Laozhen. The Farmers' Association often handled matters with only one or two people. 2. Cadres ate ten thousand yuan worth of food at the restaurant, all charged against the "fruits of victory." 3. The masses proposed to struggle against ×× and two others, former puppet Baos who had taken advantage of their power to bully people in the past, but the puppet Baos treated the village cadres to drinks, and nothing happened. The masses proposed to clean up the fruits of victory, distribute the remaining fruits immediately, and let the masses vent their anger. Cadres should implement democratic elections. The leadership educated the village cadres and accepted the opinions of the masses. Everyone's emotions were extremely high, and they all said, "Tonight's meeting is really good, it suits my heart!" Nanguan is now brewing a new struggle.

　　根据中央局指示经过重点调查
    冀县重新进行填补
    尧山南关揭穿地主收买干部逃避斗争阴谋
    发现枣园等先进村大批地主仍未消灭
    【本报威县一日电】根据中央局对冀南区党委指示，冀县以四区之枣园、增家庄、后郭村为重点，深入具体调查，发现很多封建地主未消灭，农民土地问题未获彻底解决。现该县领导机关已决定再度进行检查，推行补齐运动，力求彻底消灭封建，完成土地改革。枣园村在土地改革前，有地主六户，人十一口，土地三百二十六亩半，每人平均二十九亩七；改革后，尚有五户保持地主成份，一户降为中农，土地共剩一百五十亩七分，每人平均十三亩七分。其中之张新望全家一口人（出外）尚有地二十九亩五，张新兴一口人（亦出外），尚有土地十六亩，张新成、张赞起等户每人亦在十六亩以上。该村富农群运前九户，共五十四人，土地共四百九十七亩，每人平均九亩二分；群运后仍有地三顷四十二亩二分，每人平均六亩三分。其中有六户保持富农成份，每人土地在七亩以上，二户降为中农，一户降为富袷中农。该村中农在群运前一百零二户，五百零八口人，土地二十七顷四十三亩七，每人平均五亩四；群运后全无变动。贫农群运前有一八一户，五百四十五口人，土地十五顷零八亩半，每人平均二亩七分六；群运后成份无变化，土地增到十七顷二十六亩九，每人平均到三亩二（内有一部分沙碱地未折合）。赤贫五户，十五口人，群运前共有地五亩四；现在每人补齐到一亩八分。增家庄群运前三户地主，现在成份都原封未动。斗争前地一顷七十三亩半，每人平均十一亩六。斗争后土地减少到一顷一十一一亩九，每人平均七亩半。其中李书恩一个妇女（在外五口，但有布店一座）原有地三十亩零八分，除献田十亩，尚有二十一亩八分。另外，有一户每人平均尚有六亩，一户每人尚有七亩七，仍靠捎种或雇工耕种。斗争前富农十二户，人七十一口，土地五○九亩七，每人平均七亩一；群运后有地四顷一十三亩二，每人平均五亩八，其中五户成份未变，六户降为富裕中农，一户降为中农。富裕中农群运前三十三户，人一百二十三口，土地八顷五十五亩九，每人平均七亩；群运后成份无变化。斗争前中农五十六户，一百八十四人，七顷三十六亩三分地，每人平均四亩，斗争后无变化。群运前贫农八十一户，二百六十六口人，四顷五十四亩半土地，每人平均七亩一分；群运后土地增为五顷八十三亩七分，每人平均二亩二分，其中只有五户军属，土地补到每人三亩，上升为中农。斗争前赤贫十九户，卅七口人，无地；斗争后，除一户军属每人补到三亩，其余均补到二亩，共得到土地七十七亩半。后郭村地主宋进禄，斗争前六十亩地，六口人；斗争后尚有地四十亩，四口人。地主宋老消，斗争前五十五亩地，五口人；斗争后土地根本未动。只有地主宋长科一户的封建剥削被彻底消灭。被斗或献地的四户富农中，原有地二顷二十三亩，人二十五口，共献田一十五亩，后又送回十亩半。该村赤贫农每人只补到二亩一分八，但尚有六户每人均在一亩以下。四区原为县区干部认为老区中土地改革最好的地区，而枣园、后郭村又为四区的先进村庄，自去年十月即全力进行发动群众，十二月又进行过一次查减，县委会准备很快即转入大生产；但以该三村为重点进行深入调查后，始发觉土地改革仍未彻底，现正重新进行填补中。
    【本报威县一日电】尧山县南关于一月二十日，召开农会妇会联席会，检讨过去翻身斗争，小组长从汇报中，发现以下问题：一、斗争西街地主李老珍时，某干部打掩护，叫群众往回倒东西，说妇女会欺骗老珍。农会有事常是一二人包办。二、干部在饭铺吃了十来万元，都从果实中当账。三、群众提意见愿意斗争过去当伪保长仗势欺人的××等三人，但伪保长请村干喝了酒就没事了。群众提出将果实清理一下，剩的果实马上分了，还得叫群众出出气；干部应实行民主大选举。领导上对村干进行了教育，接受了群众的意见，大家情绪异常高涨，都说“今天晚上这会开的真好，可趁俺的心哩”。现南关正酝酿新的斗争。
