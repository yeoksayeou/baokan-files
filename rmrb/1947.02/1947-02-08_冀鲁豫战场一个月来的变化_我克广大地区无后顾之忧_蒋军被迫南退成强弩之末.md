Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Pu's commentary on the changes in the JiluYu battlefield in the past month:

[Report from the JiluYu Front, February 6th] Xinhua News Agency special correspondent Li Pu commented on the changes in the JiluYu battlefield in the past month, stating: In early January, Chiang's troops, Wang Jingjiu and Wang Zhonglian, occupied Daming from the east and west routes, attempting to reopen the Pinghan Railway under the guise of a peace offensive. General Liu Bocheng's troops marched straight to southwestern Shandong, deep into their flanks, annihilating approximately 30,000 of Chiang's troops, and recovering six county towns including Juye, Jiaxiang, Chengwu, Dingtao, Shanxian, and Caoxian, as well as recovering Liaocheng in northwestern Shandong, eliminating worries about the rear. The six county towns of Puyang, Guancheng, Fanxian, Qingfeng, Nanle, occupied by Chiang's army east of the Jilu border, and Linzhang in northern Henan, occupied by Chiang's army to the west, were also successively recovered by General Liu's troops, not only once again thwarting Chiang's delusion of opening the Pinghan Railway, but also directly threatening the Longhai Railway with the force of thunder, closely coordinating with the victorious counterattacks in the Shandong Liberated Area, seriously threatening important bases of Chiang's troops such as Xuzhou and Kaifeng, forcing Wang Jingjiu's troops, which had been clamping down from the east, to retreat south in panic after suffering losses, stretching across the Longhai Line at right angles to their western clamp, putting them in a position to be attacked everywhere. The Fifth Army under Wang Jingjiu's command is the backbone of Chiang Kai-shek's northern invasion, repeatedly making futile trips and becoming exhausted, and is indeed facing its demise.

    冀鲁豫战场一个月来的变化
    我克广大地区无后顾之忧
    蒋军被迫南退成强弩之末
    新华社记者李普评述
    【本报冀鲁豫前线六日电】新华社特派记者李普评述冀鲁豫战场一个月来之变化称：一月初，蒋军王敬久、王仲廉由东西两路占我大名，在和平攻势烟幕之下，再一次要想打通平汉路。刘伯承将军所部挥戈直下鲁西南，深入其侧后，歼蒋军约三万之众，收复巨野、嘉祥、城武、定陶、单县、曹县等六个县城，并收复鲁西北之聊城，解除后顾之忧。冀鲁边界蒋军东钳所侵占之濮县、观城、范县、清丰、南乐及西钳所侵占之豫北临漳等六座县城亦先后为刘将军所部收复，不仅又一次粉碎蒋军打通平汉之妄想，且以电霆万钧之势直逼陇海路，与山东解放区之胜利反击密切配合，严重威胁徐州、开封等蒋军重要基地，迫使蒋军东钳之王敬久部不得不于创痛之余仓惶南退，横陈于陇海线上，与其西钳形成一直角，处于处处挨打之地位。按王敬久所辖之第五军为蒋介石北侵之主干，几度往返徒劳，疲惫不堪，实已面临其末日。
