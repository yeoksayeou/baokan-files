After District Chief Zhang, on behalf of the people of the entire district, paid tribute to the troops, he called on everyone not to forget the Eighth Route Army after liberation, to strengthen production, and to do everything to support the front lines. After Director Li of the rectification team reported on the victory situation, the shout of "Support the Eighth Route Army and defend the good times" shook the mountains and valleys, and the faces of the masses were full of smiles. When the drum music started, the masses carried condolences around the venue and sent them to the troops, including live pigs, pork, chickens, sheep, and many other miscellaneous items. (王野风, 王履端)
