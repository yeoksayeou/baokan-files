　　"Take the road of prosperity through labor!"
    Soldier persuades family to donate land
    Zhu Wen
    Comrade Meng He's family was a landlord family. In this land reform movement, before the masses had settled accounts with his family, his father ran to the army to find Comrade Meng He and said, "The poor people in the village want to struggle against us, what should we do?" Comrade Meng He knew that "the revolution cannot succeed without mobilizing the peasants." He quickly explained this principle and the mistake of exploiting the poor to his father. His father listened and didn't quite understand, but he didn't say anything and went back.
    A few days later, Comrade Meng He took leave to go home, taking advantage of a break in the war.
    First, he returned to the village office. The village cadres praised him when they saw him and offered him cigarettes. Meng He started chatting with them, from the victory on the front lines to the land reform movement, and then to the affairs of the village. Comrade Meng He apologized to everyone, saying, "Last time my father went to the front to find me without consulting you. I criticized him at that time, please forgive me!" The village cadres all said, "That's okay, we haven't taken good care of your family, please bear with us!" Everyone chatted happily for a while.
    After returning home from the village office, Meng He said to his father, "Now is the time for peasants to turn over, our family must honestly confess to the masses." His father listened and said indignantly, "What do you want me to confess? Although we were landlords in the past, we have never done anything bad in the street!" Comrade Meng He patiently persuaded him: "Think about it, where did our family property come from? Wasn't it accumulated by several tenant households tying their stomachs and sending us grain? We used to hire four laborers, and they worked hard all year round, but they only got a little bit of grain from our family, not enough for the whole family to eat. Isn't this a serious exploitation of them? If it weren't for the poor people working for us, we wouldn't have been able to harvest grain even if we had land!" At first, his father frowned a little when he heard this, but later his face softened, and he nodded occasionally. Meng He continued, "Because we are a military family, the village is polite to us, but we must be proactive." After persuading his father, he went to his grandmother and said, "Grandma, the village is not struggling against us because we are a military family, but our family must be more proactive to be worthy of their kindness..." At first, his grandmother was very reluctant, but Meng He enlightened her for a long time, and his grandmother finally said, "I have sixty-five silver dollars, I'm old and I don't need them, aren't I leaving them for you anyway?" Comrade Meng He said, "That's good, if you leave them to me, I'll donate them voluntarily." His grandmother said, "Then okay!..." and took out the sixty-five silver dollars.
    The news of Comrade Meng He mobilizing his family to donate things spread throughout the village, and the villagers praised him: "Fighting against Chiang Kai-shek is for us, and he also mobilized his family to donate voluntarily to help us turn over. The Eighth Route Army is full of good people."
    At the mass meeting, the village cadres read out the items donated by Comrade Meng He: "Three carts, one waterwheel, two stone and six dou of grain, sixty-five silver dollars, five main rooms, one house, nine mu of land..." The masses proposed, "Although Meng He's family is a landlord, he is a military family, and he doesn't have much land or manpower. Let's return the nine mu of land to Meng He's family!" The whole audience unanimously agreed.
    After the matter was settled, Comrade Meng He persuaded his family to produce well and take the road of prosperity through labor. Only then did he return to the team happily.

　　“要走劳动发家的路子！” 
    战士说服家人献田
    朱文
    孟和同志家庭是个地主，这次农民翻身运动中，群众还未和他家算账，他父亲就跑到部队上来，找孟和同志说：“村里穷人要斗争咱哩，怎么办？”孟和同志知道“农民不发动起来，革命不能成功。”他很快的将这个道理和家里剥削穷人的错误，给他父亲解释了一番，父亲听了，思想并没打通，但也不啃气就回去了。
    隔了些天，孟和同志利用战争的空隙请假回家。
    首先回到村里村公所，村干部见了都夸奖他，并买纸烟招待。孟和便和他们拉谈起来，由前线打胜仗拉到翻身运动，然后拉到村里的事。孟和同志向大家道歉说：“上次我父亲没和你们商量就去前方找我，我那时已批评了他，请大家原谅！”村干部都说：“那不要紧，对你家里照顾不周，还望你多包涵哩！”大家都很客气的欢谈了一阵。
    从村公所回到了家里，孟和就和他父亲说：“现在是农民翻身的时候，咱家要好好向群众坦白。”他父亲听了，愤忿不平的说：“你叫我坦白啥呀，咱过去虽是地主，但咱在街上没有做过坏事！”孟和同志很耐心的说服着：“你想想，咱的家业从那里来的？还不是以前几家佃户捆着肚子给咱送粮，积攒下来的吗？咱们过去用四个雇工，人家一年到头忙个死去活来，粮食收到咱家里，人家倒分一点点，不够全家吃用的，这不是剥削得人家很厉害吗？要不是人家穷人给咱劳动，咱有地也不会收粮食呀！”在开始，他父亲听了有些皱眉头，后来听的脸色转和了，间或也点点头，孟和接着说：“因为咱是军属，村里才对咱客气，但咱可要自动。”在说服了父亲之后，他又去到祖母那里，说：“奶奶，村上不斗争咱，因咱是军属，不过咱家可得自动些才对得起人家的好意呀………”祖母初很不乐意，孟和细细开导了半天，祖母才说：“我就是那六十五块现洋，我老了要它没用，还不是给你留下吗？”孟和同志说：“那就好，留给我我就把它自动了”，祖母说：“那么好吧！……”把六十五块现洋拿了出来。
    孟和同志动员家庭献东西的消息马上传遍了全村，乡亲们都称赞他：“打老蒋为了咱，叫咱们翻身又动员家里自动，八路军里净是好人。”
    群众会上，村干部把孟和同志献的东西念了一遍：“大车三辆、水车一辆、粮食两石六斗、现洋六十五块、堂屋五间、宅子一所、地九亩……。”群众提出：“虽然孟和家是地主，可是他是军属，地也不多，人手也少，还是把九亩地退还孟和家吧！”全场一致同意。
    事情办妥，孟和同志又说服家人，好好生产，要走劳动发家的路子。这才很愉快的归队去了。
