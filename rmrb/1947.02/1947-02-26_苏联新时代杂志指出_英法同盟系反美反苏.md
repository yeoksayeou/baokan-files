Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 24th: Moscow dispatch: The "New Era" magazine commented on the Anglo-French alliance treaty on the 22nd, stating that Britain urgently needs to form a Western European bloc with France because it believes that without it, it would feel too weak to compete with the Soviet Union and the United States. The purpose of this Western European alliance is aggressive, anti-Soviet, and has a strong anti-American sentiment, because the United States first threatens the European market, and secondly threatens the colonies of Western European countries, which are being eroded by American expansionism.

　　苏联新时代杂志指出
    英法同盟系反美反苏
    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科讯：新时代杂志二十二日评论英法同盟条约称，英国之所以急需与法国缔成西欧集团，是因为她认为若不如此，则与苏美竞争深感太弱。这个西欧同盟的目的是侵略性的，反苏，并且有浓厚的反美，因为美国首先威胁着欧洲市场，其次是威胁着西欧各国的殖民地，这些殖民地正在被美国的扩张主义蚕食中。
