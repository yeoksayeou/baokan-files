　　(Reported by He Gaomin of the Anyang County Committee from Changzhi): In the past month and a half, the situation in Anyang's struggle against the enemy has completely shifted to our initiative, and widespread guerrilla warfare has been launched behind enemy lines. Our militia and local armed forces are now able to operate in villages dozens of * li behind enemy lines. In the past month and a half, there have been a total of 564 battles, large and small, with the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing 403 enemy and puppet platoon leaders and below. The ratio of enemy to our casualties is ten to one. We have recovered 49 villages and towns, burned 54 enemy blockhouses, and seized many other guns and ammunition. The active struggle has excited the broad masses behind enemy lines and struck a blow at the ferocity of the special agents and "Homecoming Corps." The experience of the month and a half of struggle against the enemy proves that: 1. Only by taking active actions can we seize the initiative. We used the method of commending meritorious service to motivate cadres' will to fight and launched widespread guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. 2. Only by cadres and militia establishing an independent fighting spirit and overcoming the viewpoint of simply relying on the main force can we actively carry out guerrilla warfare. The passive situation in the early stage of the Anyang struggle was due to the idea of simply relying on the main force. However, after overcoming the idea of simply relying on the army, the situation quickly opened up. 3. The combination of cadres taking the lead and taking action themselves and boldly mobilizing the militia is an important link in carrying out and persisting in the struggle. After the situation opens up, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the militia, give full play to their creativity and initiative, so as to make the guerrilla warfare active and powerful. Otherwise, the militia will be passive, moving only when pushed, and will not achieve more victories. 4. Adapt the organizational form to the environment and strengthen unified leadership. We have unified and organized various forces in different regions, such as the garrison area, the springboard area, the guerrilla area behind the stubborn enemy, the basic company, the district cadre team, and the militia, into a joint defense, making defense and offense flexible and powerful.
    How to Carry out the Meritorious Service Campaign
    Since Anyang put forward the meritorious service campaign in November, the cadres and militia of the whole county have actively performed meritorious service in fighting against the enemy. In 25 days, they have fought independently more than 400 times, and the situation of struggle in the whole county has changed dramatically. The preliminary experience of the meritorious service campaign is as follows: 1. The leadership should first break the illusion of being afraid of collapse tomorrow if they are praised today. Use the method of commending meritorious service to motivate cadres' will to fight against the enemy. It is proposed that war is not only a test of work, but also an appraisal of one's own revolutionary qualities. The backbone of Anyang people is not soft, and they have always preferred to be knocked down than dragged down. 2. Formulate the criteria for meritorious service in combination with the call according to the actual situation. The initial requirements should not be too high to prevent failure. Even if it is a disturbance to the enemy once or a trip behind the enemy lines, it should be counted as a contribution. Anyone who can be the first to fire on various fronts is valuable. 3. Timely commend and reward individuals and collectives to set off a meritorious service competition. When County Magistrate Ma, Zhang Li, Lu Guobao and other comrades returned victoriously from behind enemy lines, they encouraged the courage of the majority of comrades, who said, "If the county magistrate dares, so do we!" This proves the importance of the leader taking action himself in a campaign. 4. Cultivate backbones and popularize the campaign. After the campaign takes shape, the leadership should go deep into the lower levels, unite the creations and experiences on all fronts in a timely manner, and consciously cultivate "locomotives" among the awarded cadres and militia, so as not to make the campaign die young. They also put forward slogans such as "reward meritorious service, create meritorious service if there is no meritorious service, add meritorious service to meritorious service, and don't be proud of meritorious service." 5. After a period of time, it is necessary to hold an award ceremony with a certain ceremony to promote the campaign to move forward. For example, at the cadres' meeting last November, ten combat models, two model district company teams, and nineteen cadres were awarded in the form of commendation, bonuses, award flags, and oral commendations. Grasp the organization of the competition and promote the new heroic spirit of each comrade, so that the meritorious service campaign will become a mass campaign.

　　安阳游击战的几点经验
    【本报长治讯】据安阳县委何高民同志报导称：安阳近一个半月来对敌斗争的形势，我已完全转入主动，广泛开展了敌后游击战争。我民兵地方武装已能在敌后×十里的村庄内进行活动。一个半月来总计与敌大小战斗五百六十四次，毙伤俘敌伪排长以下四百零三名，敌与我伤亡为十比一，我收复村镇四十九处，烧毁敌炮楼五十四座，其他枪支子弹甚多。积极的斗争兴奋了敌后广大群众，打击了特务“还乡团”的凶焰。一个半月的对敌斗争经验证明：一、只有积极行动才能争取主动，我们用表扬立功办法，激励干部斗争意志，广泛开展了敌后游击战争。二、干部民兵树立独立斗争思想，克服单纯依靠主力军观点，才能积极开展游击战争。安阳斗争初期之被动局面即由于单纯依靠主力的思想作怪，但在克服了单纯依靠军队思想后，局面即迅速打开。三、干部带头亲自动手与大胆放手发动民兵相结合，是开展与坚持斗争的重要环节。局面打开后，便须大胆放手运用民兵。发挥其创造性与主动性，才能使游击战争活跃有力，否则民兵出于被动、拨一拨、动一动，那就不会取得更多胜利。四、适应环境改变组织形式，加强一元化领导。我们将警备区、跳板区、顽后游击区，及基干连、区干队、民兵等各种不同地区的各种力量统一组织联防，使防御与进攻灵便有力。
    如何开展立功运动
    安阳自十一月提出立功运动后，全县干部民兵即积极立功对敌斗争，二十五天内单独作战四百余次，全县斗争局势为之一变，立功运动的初步经验如下：一、领导上应首先打破怕今天表扬，明天垮台的错觉。用表扬立功的办法，来激励干部对敌斗争的意志。提出战争不仅是对工作的考验。而且也鉴定自己的革命品质。安阳人的骨头并不软，从来就是宁叫碰垮，也不叫拖垮。二、根据实际情况结合号召提出立功标准。开始要求不要过高，以防落空。即使是出扰敌人一次或到敌后走一趟，也要算做功劳，凡能在各个战线上打头一炮都是宝贵的。三、及时表扬奖励个人与集体，以掀起立功竞赛。当马县长、张礼、吕国宝等同志由敌后胜利归来时，鼓舞了大多数同志的勇气，都说：“县长敢，咱也敢！”证明了一个运动中首长亲自动手的重要。四、培养骨干，普及运动。运动形成后，领导上即应深入下层，及时团结各战线上的创造和经验，并有意识的在受奖干部民兵中培养“火车头”，不使运动夭折。并提出“有功表功，没功立功，功上加功，有了功不骄傲”等口号。五、运动告一段落即需以一定的仪式举行发奖，促使运动更向前推进，如去年十一月干部大会上分以通报、奖金、奖旗与口头表扬等形式奖励了十个战斗模范、两个模范区连队，十九个干部。抓紧组织竞赛，发扬每个同志的新英雄气概，这样立功运动即成为群众性的运动。
