    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 6th: A dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th revealed in a Shanghai newspaper's Southern Jiangsu correspondence the tragic killing of five young people, including Shen Wei, who were Communist anti-Japanese guerrilla fighters, by the Kuomintang authorities in Southern Jiangsu. Shen and the others were local people who, after the Double Tenth Agreement the year before, when the Communist army withdrew north from southern Anhui, had not retreated and were arrested by the Songjiang-Jinshan-Qingpu (San Qu) Commissioner's Office, and were escorted to the Zhujiajiao training ground in the district and shot on January 10th of this year. The correspondence stated: The Kuomintang authorities, using only the abstract excuse of "kidnapping, extortion, and unruly behavior," without any factual accusation, and without any factual evidence, treated human lives as a game and carried out indiscriminate killings.

    抗日期中我游击队员
    惨遭苏南蒋政府屠杀
    【新华社延安六日电】南京二十六日讯：顷据沪报苏南通讯中揭露，苏南国民党当局惨杀中共抗敌游击队员沈蔚＠等五青年事实。沈等为当地人民，在前年双十协定后，中共军自皖南北移时，未撤退后即遭松金三区专员公署逮捕，于今年一月十日解往该区朱家角校场枪杀。该通讯称：国民党当局仅以抽象的“绑架勒索横行不法”为借口，并无任何事实之控告，更没有任何事实之证据，儿戏人命，横加杀戮。
