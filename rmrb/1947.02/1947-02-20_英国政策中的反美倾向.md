　　Anti-American Tendencies in British Policy
    Varga
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: TASS Moscow, 15th: Pravda published an article by the famous Soviet economist Varga, entitled "Anti-American Tendencies in British Policy." Varga wrote: Bevin's unwavering policy of acting in a united front with the United States has met with growing opposition in Britain. Under current conditions, Bevin's policy means that British foreign policy is subordinate to the United States. The tendency of opposition comes from extremely opposing social camps. It is well known that within the Labor Party there is strong dissatisfaction with Bevin's foreign policy of allying Britain with the United States. The Labor Party's left wing recognizes that the alliance with the United States increases the reactionary tendencies in American foreign policy and harms friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Within the Conservative Party, even among the die-hards, there is a sharp tendency to oppose Bevin's policy of unreserved cooperation with the United States, which is less known. Needless to say, this opposition is not directed at the reactionary essence of Bevin's foreign policy; rather, it condemns Bevin for not actively defending the interests of the British Empire and for failing to offer due resistance to the United States' attempts to undermine the economic foundation of the Empire—the preferential tariff system. Preferential tariffs are the only barrier to prevent American competition from driving British industry out of the Imperial market. History shows that the importance of the Imperial market for British export trade has increased over the past decade. The United States underwrote Britain's entire export, accounting for 37 percent in 1919, 45 percent in 1928, and 48 percent in 1937. After World War II, due to the low purchasing power of the European, Japanese, and Chinese markets, the importance of the Imperial market increased even further. According to reliable data from 1946, the United States' exports to the Imperial market (i.e., British colonies) accounted for more than 52 percent of its total exports. In this way, it is easy to understand why the British bourgeoisie strives to defend the Empire and its economic backbone—the preferential tariff system—while the American bourgeoisie attacks this system, calling it imperialism. The mouthpiece of the opposition faction that condemns Bevin for not being active enough in defending the interests of the British Empire and for failing to offer due resistance to the United States' attempts to undermine the economic foundation of the Empire is the well-known British Conservative politician and former Secretary of State for India, Amery. He expounds his views in a book recently published in London entitled "The Washington Loan." The main idea of the book is that the United States has used and is still using Britain's wartime and post-war difficulties to undermine the position of the British Empire and to economically and politically dominate Britain. The author believes that the United States' policy is to pursue the goal of establishing American economic hegemony throughout the world. After analyzing each chapter, Varga wrote: The whole book vividly shows how clearly this capable representative of British big capital sees the threat that the United States poses to their interests! It shows how acute the Anglo-American contradictions have become! However, the anti-American sentiment in British policy has a broader basis than the threat to the British Empire. A belief that is becoming increasingly widespread among people of all classes is that the burden of the common war and the fruits of the common victory are not distributed fairly between the United States and Britain. Indeed, the United States had one death for every [unclear number] people in the war, while Britain had one death for every hundred. The United States became richer in the war, while Britain lost about a quarter of its national wealth, and gold, American stocks, works of art, and platinum in British hands were shipped to the United States. The United States became the creditor of the entire capitalist world, while Britain became a debtor to the United States and its own colonies. The United States had larger and better production machines after the war, while most of the equipment in British industrial factories was old and worn out. The United States is currently producing higher than any peacetime production, while in Britain many factories are closed due to lack of coal. In the United States, the consumption of each person is higher than before the war, while in Britain, consumer goods can only be purchased with ration cards. The United States obtained most of the fruits of victory, while Britain's only gain was the temporary occupation of Italian colonies, while the United States obtained many coasts around the world (including bases in British colonies). Finally, the United States consolidated its position in South America against Britain and dominated the Pacific from Hawaii to the Philippines and Japan. The United States has almost completely driven Britain out of China and has established a foothold in the Near East. The rifts between the British colonial empire—India, Egypt, and Palestine—appear deeper, and many Britons believe that certain American groups tacitly support these centrifugal tendencies within the Empire.
    Varga concluded: The law of unbalanced development, where the weak are prey to the strong, applies perfectly to US-British relations. This is why, no matter what Bevin and Marshall's policies are, the further deepening of contradictions between the United States and Britain is inevitable.

### 英国政策中的反美倾向

　　英国政策中的反美倾向
    瓦尔加
    【新华社延安十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：真理报刊载苏联著名经济学家瓦尔加一文，题为“英国政策中的反美倾向”。瓦尔加写道：贝文毫不变移地按照与美国联合战线而行动的政策，在英国遇到了日趋增长的反对。在目前条件下，贝文这种政策意味着英国外交政策附属于美国。反对的倾向系来自极相反对的社会阵营。大家都已知道，在工党内部对于贝文使英国与美国同盟的外交政策，有一种强烈的不满。工党左翼认清与美国同盟增加了美国外交政策中的反动倾向，并且损害了英苏之间的友好关系。在保守党内部，即是在死硬派中间，也存在着一种尖锐反对贝文毫无保留的与美国合作政策的倾向，这倒是少有人知道的。无须说，这一反对不是针对着贝文外交政策反动的本质；而是谴责贝文保卫大英帝国的利益不够积极，并未能予美国破坏帝国经济基础——特惠税率制度的企图以应有的反抗。特惠税率是防止美国的竞争，不至于把英国工业逐出帝国市场的唯一壁垒。历史显示，在这十年来帝国市场对于英国输出贸易的重要性是增加了。美国承销了英国整个输出，在一九一九年占百分之三七，一九二八年占百分之四五，一九三七年占百分之四八。在第二次世界大战之后，由于欧洲、日本与中国市场购买力之低下，帝国市场的重要性更为增加，根据一九四六年可靠的材料，美国对帝国市场（即英国的殖民地）之输出额，占其总输出额百分之五十二以上。这样一来，英国资产阶级竭力保卫帝国及其经济脊骨——特惠税率制度，而美国资产阶级则攻击这一制度，称之为帝国主义，便十分容易了解了。谴责贝文在保卫英帝国利益时不够积极，并且未能予美国破坏帝国经济基础的企图以应有的反抗的这一反对派的喉舌，是英国著名的保守党政客，前印度事务大臣阿梅利。他在一本最近在伦敦出版的题为“华盛顿贷款”书中，阐明了他的观点。该书的主要思想，是美国曾利用而且现在仍在利用英国在战时与战后的困难，来破坏英帝国的地位，与在经济上、政治上统治英国。作者认为，美国的政策是追求建立美国在全世界经济霸权的目的。瓦尔加在逐章分析了之后，写道：整本书生动地显示出英国大资本这位干练的代表，是如何清楚地看到了美国对他们的利益的威胁啊！它显示出英美矛盾已是如何尖锐了。然而，英国政策中的反美情绪，较英帝国所受的威胁具有更广泛的基础。全国各阶层人民中间日益普遍的一种信念，是在美国与英国之间共同战争的负担与共同胜利的果实是分配得不公平的。的确，美国在战中每××人中有一人死亡，而英国在每×百人中即有一个。美国在战争中愈加发财了，而英国丧失其国家财富约四分之一，且英国手中的黄金、美国股票、艺术品以及白金都已运往美国。美国成为整个资本主义世界的债主、英国则成为美国及英国自己殖民地的债务人了。美国在战后拥有更大更好的生产机器，而英国大多数工业工厂的设备是陈旧了与用坏了。美国目前生产较任何平时生产为高，在英国许多工厂由于缺煤而关闭了。在美国，每一个人的消费较战前为高，在英国仅凭配给证才能购得消费品。美国获得了大部分的胜利果实，而英国唯一的收获是暂时占有了意大利的殖民地，美国则得到了全世界上许多海岸（包括英国殖民地的基地在内）。最后，美国巩固他在南美反对英国的地位，并且统治了从夏威夷到菲律滨与日本的太平洋。美国几乎已将英国完全逐出中国以外，并在近东建立了立脚点。在英殖民帝国——印度、埃及与巴勒斯坦之间的裂痕，显得更深了，许多英国人认为某些美国集团不动声色的支持帝国以内这些离心的倾向。
    瓦尔加结语称：弱肉强食的不平衡的发展规律，用于美英关系是完全适用的。这就是为什么不问贝文与马歇尔政策如何，而英美之间矛盾进一步加深得不可避免的原因。
