　　In Person at Bo'ai Mountain Area
    Chairman Yang Comforts Refugees
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] After returning from comforting the front-line military and civilians in the Fourth Administrative Region of Taihang, Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government made a special trip to Zhanglukou Village in the Bo'ai Mountain area on the seventh of last month to comfort the evacuated masses. On that day, the masses of the village lined the streets to welcome him. Chairman Yang smiled from afar, and as he approached, he shook hands warmly with the evacuated masses, asking about their well-being. He said, "In the past, you suffered from the oppression of the bandit troops and the 27th Army. Under Chiang Kai-shek's attack, you resolutely persisted in the struggle. You are good sons and daughters of the Chinese nation." Chairman Yang then asked everyone what difficulties they had and how the government's relief efforts were proceeding. The masses replied in unison, "The government's care is very thorough, providing both loans and grain, and also leading us in production. Our situation is getting better and better." Before leaving, Chairman Yang said, "Losing a city or county is nothing. Now we have already eliminated more than fifty enemy brigades. After we eliminate dozens more brigades, we can launch a counter-offensive down the mountain and fight back to our old homes." Everyone said excitedly, "Without realizing it, we've wiped out fifty brigades!"

    杨主席慰难胞
    【本报长治讯】边府杨主席、于太行四分区慰问前线军民归来，特于上月七日前往博爱山地张路口村，慰问撤出群众。是日该村群众夹道欢迎，杨主席远远即含笑，走近时，并与撤出群众亲切握手，问寒问暖，他说：“过去你们受尽土匪军和二十七军的压榨，在蒋介石进攻下，你们毅然坚持斗争，你们是中华民族的好儿女。”杨主席继又询问大家有什么困难，政府救济如何？群众异口同声答道：“政府关照的可周到啦，又贷款又拨粮，再加上领导俺们生产，光景近有长余哩。”临别时杨主席说：“我们丢了一城一县不算什么，现在我们已经消灭敌人五十多个旅，再消灭上几十旅，咱们就可以反攻下山，打回老家了。”大家兴奋的说：“不觉就干了它五十个旅”
