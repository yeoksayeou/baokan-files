The "Counter-Liquidation" Struggle in Tangyin Behind Enemy Lines

After the Lucheng battle last December, county leaders took personal charge and led the militia back behind enemy lines. At the time, in the occupied villages, the landlords' "Homecoming Corps" largely returned and established associations, organized special agent forces, and universally carried out "counter-liquidation" against the masses who had turned over. Wang Zhiguo of the Longwo "Homecoming Corps" relied on his association's dozen or so guns to seize the fruits of the masses' liberation, and even drove away a flock of sheep belonging to the farmers' association. Dong Changzhen of the Shaguo Kiln "Homecoming Corps" said, "Your Eighth Route Army grandpas are gone, they're no good anymore, take everything out!" and levied funds and weapons on the masses. Li Dengke, a landlord from Dongtou, acquired five or six guns and carried out counter-liquidation on a large scale, even killing several liberated masses.

Armed Political Offensives Open the Situation

After the militia fought back behind enemy lines, they first launched political offensives in these villages. At night, they directly posted slogans and leaflets on the doors of the landlords' "Homecoming Corps" and threw grenades into the yards of the "counter-liquidation" traitors as a demonstration, shouting slogans: Return the fruits of the masses, confess and repent, and the matter will be over; if you don't return them, you will be arrested and never forgiven. As for the major agents Dong Changzhen and Li Dengke, they shouted: A reward of 20,000 yuan for anyone who can capture or kill them. At the same time, they also made current affairs broadcasts. After this, the landlords immediately returned the sheep and fruits of counter-liquidation to the masses. The landlord group also began to split; some of the special agent leaders ran to Tangyin city. Li Dengke of Dongtou, before running, even called the association team home and instructed them: "I'm going to the city, you must be careful at home." After he left, the association team buried their guns. Most landlords, reluctant to leave their homes and land, established relationships with the families of the militia. From then on, we gained a firm foothold behind enemy lines to carry out guerrilla warfare.

In the area of ××, the "Homecoming Corps" and special agent "association teams" were extremely rampant in counter-liquidating the fruits of the masses' liberation. Our secret farmers' association organizations that remained behind enemy lines, after colluding and uniting a group of people, carried out underground struggles. Furthermore, our small militia and armed forces attacked the general counter-liquidating landlords, and the remaining "Homecoming Corps" members began to disintegrate internally. After we basically controlled political power, we dealt with the enemy on one hand, and on the other hand, the basic masses and the families of the withdrawn militia cadres were given living guarantees. Once, the militia secretly returned and stayed for a night. The cadres said, "We are responsible for the family, you don't need to worry about it." This stabilized the militia's emotions and helped them persevere in guerrilla warfare. In addition, they also stipulated intelligence liaison codes and methods to coordinate with the militia's activities.

The "Starry Sky" Tactic Is the Main Key to Reversing the Situation

In order to widely connect with the masses and carry out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, in addition to the large-scale joint political offensives, there should be continuous "starry sky" small-scale armed activities. This form of struggle organization can at any time and any place launch surprise attacks and suppress traitors or special agent armed forces. After our continuous attacks on the Wenjiagou "Homecoming Corps" and the arrest of all five landlord families, the "Homecoming Corps" completely showed signs of wavering. Wen Youji, one of the rulers of the village, lowered his head and colluded with us, saying: "We still have six guns, come and attack us again tomorrow, and we can hand them over to you, so we can deal with the enemy." Wen Cifu, the special agent leader who had run to the Shilin area, was also flustered at this time. He said: "As long as the Eighth Route Army doesn't kill me, I can agree to any conditions." Under the influence of our active small-scale armed activities, the twenty long guns assigned to each bao by the association teams in the villages near Wenjiagou disappeared without a trace. The masses' reaction to this tactic was: "As long as it's our own people with guns, even if only two or three come back, it's a big deal, it also boosts our courage."

A Few Points of Experience

To carry out the counter-liquidation struggle behind enemy lines, it is best to let the local militia and cadres, or the outside cadres who previously led the masses to carry out the turn-over, return. The advantage of their return is that it is easy to quickly connect with the masses, and it is also easy to grasp the masses' thoughts and master the strategies and policies for dealing with the targets of attack and handling problems.

Political offensives and military struggles must be closely integrated. For example, after suppressing the main traitors, the same continuous political offensives should be carried out. This is one of the most effective methods of counter-liquidation. Because after our military attacks, the landlord group will waver and disintegrate, and the masses' struggle emotions will gradually increase. If we continue to launch political offensives, the landlords will inevitably be more fearful, and the fruits of counter-liquidation will be easily and quickly returned to the masses.

When making broadcasts, we must shout out the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, or just say that the county magistrate or district chief has come. This can encourage the masses' fighting will. After we made broadcasts in Shaguo Kiln, Guojiagang and other villages, the next day the masses colluded and醞釀 on the street: "Don't be afraid, the county magistrate has already come down!" We must make different broadcasts to different targets. In the Longwo political offensive, the "Homecoming Corps" ran to Gulou River. We shouted for the second time: "If you don't return the things, even if you run to the ends of the earth, the Eighth Route Army will find you." In this way, the "Homecoming Corps" felt more like they were seeing ghosts everywhere, and dared not settle in one place. Our small-scale guerrilla activities could spread everywhere.

### 汤阴敌后的“反倒算”斗争

    汤阴敌后的“反倒算”斗争
    去年十二月鹿楼战役后，县领导上即亲自动手，带领民兵打回敌后。当时被占村庄，地主“还乡团”大部回村，并成立了会局，组织起特务武装，普遍向翻身群众进行“倒算”。龙卧“还乡团”王治国就凭着他会局的十几条枪，夺去群众翻身果实，还赶走农会一群羊。沙锅窑“还乡团”董长珍说：“你们八路军爷爷走了，不中了，东西都拿出来吧！”并向群众派款派枪。东头地主李登科，弄了五六枝枪，大肆倒算，还打死好几个翻身群众。
    武装政攻打开局面
    民兵打到敌后，首先就在这些村庄开展政攻。夜间直接把标语传单贴在地主“还乡团”家的大门上，并向“倒算”奸霸院里扔手榴弹示威，大喊口号：退出群众果实，坦白悔过，作为了事，如不退，捉住一定不饶。对大特务董长珍、李登科，则喊出：如捉住或能打死，悬赏两万元。同时并进行了时事喊话。此后，地主们立刻把倒算的羊群果实都向群众退还了。地主集团也起了分化，特务头子有的跑到汤阴城，东头李登科临跑时，还把会队叫到家嘱咐说：“我是到城呀，你们在家要小心。”他走后，会队便把枪支埋起来了。一般地主因家地难舍，纷纷和民兵家属建立关系。从此我在敌后便站稳了开展游击战争的脚步。
    在××一带，“还乡团”和特务“会队”，倒算群众翻身果实，极其猖狂。我留在敌后的农会秘密组织，经过串通，团结了一把人，进行地下斗争，加以我小型民兵、武装又给一般倒算地主以打击，残余“还乡团”分子内部，便起了分化。政权基本为我掌握后，一面对敌应付，同时基本群众与撤出民兵干部家属，更得到生活上的保障。有一次民兵偷回住了一夜，干部们说：“家里我们负责，你们不用结记。”安定了民兵坚持游击战争的情绪。另外并规定了情报联络记号和配合民兵活动的办法。
    “满天星”战术为扭转形势主要关键
    为了广泛联系群众开展敌后游击战争，除了声势浩大的联合政势外，应有不间断的“满天星”小型武装经常活动。这种斗争组织形式可以随时随地给奸霸或特务武装以偷袭和镇压。温家沟“还乡团”经过我连续性的打击，并将其五户地主家属全数逮捕，“还乡团”内部完全呈现动摇，该村统治人之一温有吉。便向我们低头串通说：“我们还有六支枪，再一天你们来打一下，就可缴给你们，我们好应付敌人。”跑到石林一带去的特务头温赐福，这时也着慌了，他说：“只要八路军不杀，我什么条件也能答应。”就在我这种小型武装积极活动影响下，温家沟附近村庄会局每保派的二十支长枪，便消声匿迹了。群众对这种战术的反映是：“只要是咱的带枪的，那怕回来三两个就顶事，也助胆。”
    几点经验
    到敌后进行反倒算斗争，最好是让当地民兵、干部，或过去在那里领导群众进行翻身的外来干部，他们回去的好处是容易很快和群众联系起来，及捉摸群众思想，也易掌握对打击的对象和处理问题的策略和政策。
    政攻与军事斗争要有密切结合，如对主要奸霸镇压后，接着同样应进行连续性的政攻，这是反倒算最有效验办法之一。因为在我军事上打击后，地主集团要动摇分化，群众斗争情绪逐渐提高，如继续政攻，地主必然更恐惧，倒算果实极易迅速退还群众。
    在喊话时，要把共产党八路军喊出来，或者就说是县长区长来了，这样能鼓舞群众斗争意志。我在沙锅窑、郭家岗等村喊话后，第二天群众就通街串通酝酿：“不怕了，县长已经下来啦！”对不同的对象，我们要进行不同的喊话。在龙卧政攻中，“还乡团”却跑到古楼河去，我们第二次就喊：“不退出东西，跑到天边，八路军也找着了。”这样“还乡团”更觉得草木皆兵，不敢固定住于一地，我小型游击活动，到处可以伸展。
