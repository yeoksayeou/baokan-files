　　[Report from our newspaper in Taihang, 31st] To strengthen the unity between urban and rural masses and mediate disputes arising between them during the mass movement, Changzhi City and County have specifically organized a Township-Village Dispute Mediation Group. It is composed of comrades such as Guo Shaoyi, Head of the Judicial Section of the Municipal Government, Wei Jin from the Municipal Party Committee, Shi Bingqian from the County Government, and Li Zongtang from the County Party Committee. The mediation principle is to resolve conflicts by combining ideological work with practical problem-solving. The following specific measures have been proposed: 1. Before January 5th, regardless of whether it is the city or the county, if any landlord property has already been distributed by one party, it will no longer be pursued; if it has not been distributed, it will be distributed according to a 30/70 split, such as if a village has landlord property from the city stored there, the village gets 70% and the city gets 30%. 2. If the fruits of the struggle involve industrial and commercial capital, appropriate consideration should be given. 3. If any local tyrants or landlords are hiding in the city or countryside, they should be handed over unconditionally. The group officially started working at the Changzhi County Farmers' Association on the 7th of this month. In the first two days, it mediated more than 20 dispute cases between Pengjia Village and Changzhi City. It is estimated that all discovered disputes between urban and rural areas will be resolved by the end of the month.

　　长治市县成立
    城乡问题调处小组
    【本报太行三十一日电】长治市、县为了加强城乡群众团结、调处群运中相互发生的纠纷，特组织城乡问题调处小组，由市府司法科长郭绍义、市委卫锦、县府史秉谦、县委李宗唐等同志组成。调解原则是：解圪塔，在方式上采取打通思想与解决实际问题相结合，并拟出以下几条具体办法：一、在元月五日前，无论市县任何一方，只要属于地主物资，已经一方分配者，不再追究；未分配者，按三七分配，如某村寄存有城市地主财物，村得七、城市得三。二、果实如涉到工商业资本时，要适当照顾。三、如有恶霸地主隐藏在城或乡者，均应无条件交出。该组已于本月七日在长治县农会正式办公，头两天内即调解了彭家村与长市纠纷问题二十余件。所有城乡已发现的纠纷问题，预计月底即可全部解决。
