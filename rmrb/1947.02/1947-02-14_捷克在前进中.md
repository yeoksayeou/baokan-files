    Czechoslovakia is Moving Forward
    By Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain
    Czechoslovakia is already being rebuilt. Hitler's Nazi Party tried its best to plunder Czech industrial machinery and agricultural products. They consumed the entire Czech national economy. Although the material damage inflicted on Czech industry by the German fascist bandits did not exceed ten percent, the economic loss to the entire Czech nation reached a severe level of fifty percent. The total property loss of the Czech and Slovak people within Czechoslovakia amounted to 750 million pounds. In this situation, only resolute and far-sighted steps could restore the country's economic life.

    The Law on Nationalizing Industry

    The people of Czechoslovakia understand that economic revival and the building of a new democratic Czechoslovakia must rely on the nationalization of industry. They resolutely and boldly promoted the following urgent steps: First, the property of Germans, Hungarians, national traitors, and collaborators was placed under state control. The managers were democratically elected by the workers of the relevant enterprises. In October 1945, nine thousand enterprises, large and small, were already under state control. This measure paved the way for the nationalization of industry and various large enterprises.

    Second, all land belonging to German and Hungarian landlords and Czech and Slovak national traitors was confiscated. These lands were fairly distributed to the vast number of farmers of all nationalities within Czechoslovakia, based on the actual situation. The land confiscated from German landlords alone amounted to 6.4 million acres. Half of it was suitable for cultivation. Calculating 25 acres of land as a unit, 130,000 farmer families have already obtained enough arable land. In Slovakia alone, 80,000 to 90,000 farmer families received this distribution of arable land.

    Third, all banking enterprises, private insurance companies, local mines, and basic industries have also been nationalized. The mining industry has been 100% nationalized, the machinery industry 85%, and the food industry 20%. Considering all industries in Czechoslovakia, 70% have been nationalized. (Although the British Labour Party government declared in its platform that it was preparing to nationalize various private enterprises, to this day it has only planned to nationalize 20%.)

    National Front Government

    The Czechoslovak government is vigorously promoting this nationalization plan. The Czech government is composed of six parties forming the National Front, including the Communist Party of Bohemia, the Social Democratic Party, the National Socialist Party, the Catholic People's Party of Bohemia, and the Communist Party of Slovakia and the Democratic Party of Slovakia. The current political system of the New Czechoslovakia differs in many ways from the political system before the war. Before the war, there were a total of sixteen political parties in Czechoslovakia, including various reactionary parties representing Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, and German landlords and monopolistic financial capitalists. Today, the new democratic Czech government has closed down the above-mentioned reactionary parties and absolutely prohibits them from participating in any political activities. This strict restriction on reactionary parties has helped the rapid development of Czech democratic forces and the progress of the country.

    The most important and largest party in the Czech government is the Czech Communist Party. Since its establishment in 1921, it has become one of the most powerful parties in Czechoslovakia. In the last pre-war election in 1935, the Communist Party occupied 30 of the 300 seats in the parliament, becoming the fourth largest party in the country. However, at that time, the number of party members was only tens of thousands. Today, the Communist Party has one million members, with 1,200 local and factory organizations as the backbone of the party. The various daily newspapers published by the Communist Party have a daily circulation of more than one million copies. In addition to the above-mentioned one million members (all of whom are Czech), there are 200,000 members who are Slovak. Therefore, the total number of Communist Party members in Czechoslovakia is actually more than 1.2 million, accounting for 11.2% of the country's population. According to the Ministry of Food, the population of Czechoslovakia is 10.7 million. If we exclude children, the percentage of Communist Party members in the total population of the Czech Republic will obviously be even higher.

    The Czech Party's official newspaper is the "Red Flag Daily." The work of editing, printing, and distributing the "Red Flag Daily" is carried out in the publishing house of the pre-war Agrarian Party (a fairly powerful reactionary party in the past - Editor). I have not seen such a magnificent and beautiful publishing house except for the "Pravda" building in Moscow.

    The Czech Communist Party has a total of eighty party schools. All school buildings are quite magnificent. Czechoslovakia, to this day, has not had time to publish enough educational pamphlets to educate its members.

    Communist Party Members are the Most Active Elements in the Country

    Communist Party members occupy several important positions in the current Czech government, including Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Propaganda, Minister of Education, Minister of Social Welfare, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Slovakia, among other important positions. The political program of the National Front mainly relies on the leadership of important leaders of the Communist Party to implement it. The people of Czechoslovakia and other parties recognize the Communist Party as the most active and vigorous factor in the National Front and the government.

    During the Eighth National Congress of the Czech Communist Party, which was recently held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, the party chairman, Klement Gottwald, declared at the end of the conference: "Our policy will continue to be to support and support the National Front. We maintain and further consolidate the unity of the National Front. In order to further consolidate the National Front, we will absorb trade unions, cooperatives, and farmers' associations representing the broad masses of the people to participate." Today, the Czech trade union movement is united and strong. During the period from 1937 to 1938, the trade unions under the leadership of the nineteen trade union headquarters in Czechoslovakia totaled only about eight. At that time, the entire trade union movement was fragmented due to differences in the political lines of the various parties. Today, all the trade unions in Czechoslovakia are 100% united. Their total membership reaches more than two million. The chairman of the Czech Confederation of Trade Unions is Antonin Zapotocky. He is one of the important leaders of the Czech Communist Party.

    The General Election of May 26

    There is no doubt that the Czech Communist Party is the largest and strongest party in the country. The national election held on May 26 proved how satisfied and supportive the broad masses of the people are of the Czech Communist Party's policies. (As a result of the election, the Czech Communist Party won the greatest victory and became the largest party in the parliament. Gottwald has become the Prime Minister of the Czech cabinet - Editor).

    The Unity of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party

    The close unity between the Czech Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party guarantees that the great struggle of the Czech people to seize power will surely achieve a glorious victory. Within the National Front, the Czech Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Slovak National Socialist Party (i.e., the party led by former Czech President Benes before the war - Editor) have jointly organized the "Workers' National Group" in cities and villages. On June 10, 1945, they (i.e., the above three parties - Editor) signed a historic agreement on government policies, on the National Committee (Czechoslovakia is a multi-ethnic country - Editor), and on jointly establishing unified trade unions, cooperatives, sports associations, and youth organizations. This "National Group" composed of these three parties obtained 90% of the votes in the national election. This fact is enough to prove that this "National Group" is the most powerful force that determines everything.

    Czechoslovakia will be the First to Implement Socialism after the Soviet Union

    Please pay attention to Czechoslovakia! It is advancing rapidly on the road to new democracy, and after the Soviet Union, it will be the first to realize socialism.

    Today, the people of Czechoslovakia are encountering considerable difficulties in many ways. But they are also in an exciting new environment. They are working hard in unity to rebuild their country and lives. They deeply understand; they are running towards that road, and they are determined to run through it in the shortest possible time.

    For example: their attitude towards state-owned enterprises is particularly exciting. Why? Because they understand that they themselves are the main driving force behind this state-owned plan. They understand: the complete realization of the state-owned plan is not only to ensure the glorious future of the entire nation, but also for their own happiness. During my visit to Czechoslovakia, I discovered the following encouraging examples.

    捷克在前进中
    英共总书记  波立特
    捷克斯洛伐克已经在再建中。希特勒纳粹党曾尽量掠夺捷克的工业机械和农产品。他们消耗了捷克的全部国民经济。虽然德国法西斯匪徒对捷克的工业在物质上所造成的损害未超过百分之十，但是捷克全国在经济上的损失却达到百分之五十的严重程度。捷克斯洛伐克境内捷克和斯洛伐克人民的财产损失总共达七十五万万磅。在这种情况下，唯有坚决和目光远大的步骤才能够恢复国家的经济生活。
    国家工业化的法令
    捷克斯洛伐克的人民都懂得，经济复兴和建设新民主的捷克必须依靠工业的国家化。他们坚决和大胆的推进了下列的急需步骤：第一、德国人、匈牙利人、民族叛徒和附逆分子的财产都归国家管理。各管理人都由各有关企业的工人进行民主选举。在一九四五年的十月间，有九千个大小企业已在国家的管理下。这种措施开辟了实行工业和各种大实业收归国营的道路。
    第二、德人大地主、匈牙利人大地主和捷克与斯洛伐克民族叛徒的所有土地都实行充公。这些土地都根据实际的情形公平的分配给捷克国内各民族的广大农民。单是德人大地主被没收的土地就达六百四十万英亩。其中有一半是适于耕种的土地，以二十五英亩土地为一单位来计算，就已经有十三万个农民家庭获得足够的耕地。单单在斯洛伐克省就有八万至九万家农民获得这种耕地的分配。
    第三、所有的银行企业，私人的保险公司，各地的矿场和基本的工业也已经收归国有。矿业已经百分之一百的收归国有，机器工业百分之八十五，而粮食工业百分之二十。就以捷克国内的全部工业来计算，已经百分之七十收归国有。（英国工党政府虽然在政纲上宣称准备将各种私人企业收归国有；但是一直到今天为止，它还只是计划着将百分之二十收归国有而已。）
    民族战线的政府
    竭立推动这个国营计划的正是捷克斯洛伐克政府。捷克政府由组成民族战线的六个政党共同组成，其中包括捷克省的共产党、社会民主党、民族社会党、天主教人民党和斯洛伐克省的共产党与民主党。新捷克的现存政治制度和战前的政治制度有许多不相同的地方。在战前，捷克国内总共有十六个政党，其中还包括代表捷克人、斯洛伐克人、匈牙利和德国人大地主和独占金融资本家的各反动政党。今天，新民主的捷克政府已封闭上述各反动政党并绝对禁止它们参加任何政治活动。对反动政党的这种严厉的限制，帮助了捷克民主力量的迅速发展和国家的进步。
    捷克政府中最重要和最大的政党是捷克共产党。自从它在一九二一年成立以来，即成为捷克国内最强大的政党之一。在战前一九三五年最后一次的选举中，共产党在国会的三百议席中占三十席，成为全国第四个大政党。但是，当时党员的数量却只有几万人而已。今天共产党已经拥有一百万党员，已有一千二百个当地组织和工厂组织为党的骨干。共产党出版的各种日报每日的销数达一百万份以上。除了上述的一百万党员以外（全数是属于捷克民族的），还有二十万党员是属于斯洛伐克民族的。所以，捷克全国的共产党员总数实际上达一百二十万以上，占全国人口的百分之十一·二。根据粮食部统计，捷克全国人口达一千零七十万。假如我们把儿童除外，则共产党员在全捷克总人口中所占的百分比显然会更加高。
    捷克党的机关报是《红旗日报》。编辑、印刷和发行《红旗报》的工作都是在战前的农村党（是过去的一个相当强大的反动政党——编者）的出版机关进行的。除了莫斯科的“真理报”馆以外，我没有见过一间这样堂皇和漂亮的出版机关。
    捷克共产党一共有八十所党校。所有校舍建筑都是相当宏伟的，捷克一直到今天为止，还来不及出版足够的教育小册子来进行对党员的教育。
    共产党员是全国最积极的分子
    共产党员在现捷克政府中占着几个相当重要的职位，包括副总理、内政部长、宣传部长、教育部长、社会福利部长、斯洛伐克省的副外交部长等重要职位。民族战线的政治纲领主要的是依靠共产党的重要领袖来领导执行的。全捷克的人民和其他各政党公认共产党是民族战线和政府里最积极和活跃的因素。
    在最近曾于捷克首都布拉格市召开的捷克共产党第八届全国代表大会的过程中，该党主席克里曼·哥德瓦特氏曾在大会结束时宣称：“我们的政策将继续是拥护和支持民族战线。我们保持和进一步巩固民族战线的团结一致。为了更加巩固民族战线，我们将吸收代表广大人民的职工会，合作社和农民协会等来参加”。今天捷克的职工运动是团结一致和强大的。在一九三七年至一九三八年的期间内，捷克全国的十九个职工总部领导下的职工会总共只八个左右。那时，整个职工运动曾由于各政党政治路线的分歧而被弄成四分五裂。今天，全捷克的职工都已经是百分之一百的团结起来了。它们的会员总数达二百万以上，捷克的职工联合总会的主席是安南军雅巴多基氏。他是捷克共产党的重要领袖之一。
    五月二十六日的大选
    毫无疑问，捷克共产党是全国最大和最强的政党。五月二十六日举行的全国大选证明广大人民是如何满意和拥护捷克共产党的政策。（大选结果，捷克共产党获得最大胜利，成为国会里最大的政党、哥德瓦特已为捷克内阁的总理——编者）。
    共产党和社会党的团结
    捷克共产党和社会民主党之间的紧密团结，保证捷克人民夺取政权的伟大斗争必然获得光荣的胜利。在民族战线以内，捷克的共产党，社会民主党与斯洛伐克民族社会党（即战前捷克总统贝奈斯领导下的政党——编者）已经在城市和乡村里共同组织了“劳动者民族集团”。在一九四五年六月十日，它们之间（即上述三个政党之间——编者）对政府的政策，在民族委员会方面（捷克是一个多民族的国家——编者）和关于共同建立统一的职工会、合作社、体育会和青年组织等问题已经签订了一个有历史意义的协定。由这三个组成的“民族集团”获得全国百分之九十的选举票。这个事实足以证明这个“民族集团”是决定一切的最强大的力量。
    除苏联外捷克将首先实行社会主义
    请大家注意捷克斯洛伐克！她在迅速的向新民主主义的道路猛进中，而且除苏联之外，它将首先实现社会主义。
    今天捷克的人民在许多方面都遭遇到相当的困难。但是他们却同时处在一个令人兴奋的新环境里面。他们正在团结一致，为重建他们的国家和生活而努力奋斗。他们深切的懂得；他们正在向那一条道路跑，而且已决心在最短时期内跑完它。
    例如：他们对国营的态度是特别令人兴奋的。为什么呢？因为他们懂得他们自己是这个国营计划的主要推动力。他们懂得：国营计划的彻底实现，不只是为了保证全民族的光荣前途，而且同时也是为了他们自己的幸福，我在访问捷克的过程中，发现了下述这几个令人鼓舞的例子。
