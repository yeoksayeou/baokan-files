    Xinhua News Agency, Lvliang Front, 11th -- Since the Jinzhong Eighth Route Army recovered the county seat of Wenshui and the important towns of Gujiao, Hekou, and Kaishan, and removed 55 large and small strongholds occupied by Yan's troops, the entire territory of Wenshui, most of Jiao (cheng) Yang (qu), and the mountainous areas bordering Qing (yuan) and Tai (yuan), totaling 240,000 people, have been liberated. The 90-li-long Yuheda section of the Tai (yuan) Fen (yang) highway from Jiaocheng to Fenyang in the northeast is completely under the control of the Eighth Route Army. The vast Jinzhong plain and mountainous areas have been linked together. Consequently, Fenyang City, the springboard for Yan's troops to attack the Liberated Areas, has fallen into isolation.
