Yinwa, Yinwa, how old are you this year?
	I am already eleven years old!
Yinwa, Yinwa, why do you want to join the army?
	To avenge my parents!
The landlord and the wicked gentry are really vicious,
They killed my parents and burned our home.
I have hatred in my heart,
I want to wipe out all the reactionaries.
Yinwa, Yinwa, you are still young,
You cannot carry a gun or a cannon.
Yinwa, Yinwa, what can you do in the army?
	I can deliver letters and carry stretchers.
I can be a sentinel and stand guard,
I can recognize the landlord's lackeys.
When I grow up a little,
I will annihilate the bandits with big guns!
Our Yinwa is really good,
He is brave and strong-willed.
Everyone, let us all learn from him,
To liberate all of China!
