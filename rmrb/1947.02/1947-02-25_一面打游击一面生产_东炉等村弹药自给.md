　　Fighting Guerrilla Warfare While Simultaneously Engaging in Production
    Donglu and Other Villages Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Ammunition
    [This Newspaper, Taihang News] In the seventh district of Taigu, the cadres, militia, and their families from Donglu, Shangzhuang, Dongli, Xiaobai, Zinian, and other villages occupied by Yan's puppet army, under the policy of persisting in struggle and simultaneously engaging in production, have gradually moved towards self-sufficiency. Each village has organized front and rear headquarters. The front is led by armed cadres and political directors who lead the militia in combat, while the rear is a production and supply department, leading all evacuated men and women in production. Men transport goods, while women make shoes and spin cotton. After a month of effort, Donglu and Shangzhuang villages have achieved complete self-sufficiency in life and ammunition. The remaining villages have also achieved half self-sufficiency. The production funds of Donglu and Shangzhuang villages have reached one million yuan. Furthermore, in order to enable the militia to be self-sufficient in ammunition, the district allocated 100 shi of grain last winter to establish a militia cooperative, which is managed by armed cadres. Currently, by February, the cooperative is able to supply all provisions and ammunition for 40 militiamen and subsidize half of the grain for the evacuated villages. It is estimated that by March, it will be able to supply all militiamen who have left production and gone deep behind enemy lines to fight.
