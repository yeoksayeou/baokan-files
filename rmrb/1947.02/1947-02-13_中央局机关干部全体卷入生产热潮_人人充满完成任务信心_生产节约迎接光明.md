    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call for production and thrift to greet the bright future, the cadres of the Central Bureau organs have all plunged into the production and thrift campaign. After dinner on February 10th, this reporter walked through the various departments of the organs and saw that every comrade was working hard in production.

    At the primary school east of the Central Bureau's residence, groups of male and female comrades, communicators, and young children were climbing in front of more than 30 walls, whitewashing each section of the wall with lime. These were comrades from the Administrative Office, the Civil Affairs Department, the Organization Department, and the Communications Section contracting for production for the Preparatory Committee of the ×× Conference. In just a few days of labor, they had produced wealth worth 18,500 yuan. The general branch secretary, Secretary Cui, and the Communications Section formed a mutual aid contracting team, and also brushed 19 rooms in three days, earning wages of 8,900 yuan. The reporter talked with each comrade in their mutual aid group, and they never felt that production and work would conflict. Secretary Cui told the reporter: In order to free up more time for the comrades in the Communications Section to engage in production, and to free up one comrade in the mutual aid group to go to Xingtai to learn how to operate a hand-cranked spinning machine, he had to set aside some of his administrative work time to receive and send letters for the Communications Section, which meant that his administrative work had to become more planned and intensive. Recently, this mutual aid group has also specifically studied the scientific arrangement of each comrade's work, and they have found that they can save even more manpower to carry out production, and the work of their department has become more rationalized.

    The reporter stepped into the courtyard of the Administrative Office and heard the melodious sound of a spinning wheel from afar. This was Comrade Li Xuwu spinning cotton. In the face of the Communists, difficulties never exist. After the Central Bureau's mobilization meeting for production and thrift, Comrade Li Xuwu did not hesitate at all and chose this production work that he had never done before, and volunteered to spin cotton for three hours a day after work. After carrying the spinning wheel back from eighty li away, he only worked hard for one day and learned how to spin cotton, and he can spin one and a half taels of thread every day. Like him, comrades from the Transportation Section, the Supply Section, the Civil Affairs Department, the Secretariat and other departments are also engrossed in spinning cotton. They have newly made nine spinning wheels. The Transportation Section has spun half a catty of cotton for the villagers, earning wages of 350 yuan. Secretary-General Tao, who is busy with work, also spent 3,000 yuan to buy a spinning wheel, and he guarantees to produce for one hour every day.

    In the Research Office of the General Office, the production of cadres and young children is organized together, adopting a package of labor approach. They are rushing to make notebooks, and relying on this production, the production tasks of everyone in the Research Office can be completed quickly. They clearly stated that after completing the production tasks quickly, they will continue to produce and establish a household.

    The comrades of the General Affairs Section, who are busy with life affairs, are also carrying out production in conjunction with their own work. The production task of 80,000 yuan for the entire group of eight people is completed by sprouting soybeans, planting small vegetables, spinning cotton, and making soy sauce. In the past ten days, they have made and sold forty catties of ham and sausage, and they are very optimistic that one-half of all production tasks can be completed in February.

    In addition to spinning cotton, the comrades of the Civil Affairs Department are now purchasing sewing machines, preparing to sew clothes for production. The comrades of the Propaganda Department and the Organization Department are also preparing to buy a mule to grind flour for the public. Although other miscellaneous staff members have not stipulated production tasks due to the busyness of their work, they have also plunged into this hot production and thrift campaign in order to reduce the supply of the public.

    The reporter has walked through all the departments of the organs that are engaged in production, and has not seen a single person who is not full of confidence in completing the production tasks. In addition to actively producing, they are striving to carry out thrift. Some have saved all the supplied clothing, allowances, and daily necessities, and some have saved most of them except for a few daily necessities. According to the extremely incomplete statistics of various departments, the entire organ (missing two departments) has saved a total of 2,740 kilograms of allowances, seven sets of single clothing, seventeen people have saved cotton clothing, forty-eight people have saved cotton quilts, seventy-five pairs of padded shoes have been saved, thirty-five pairs of socks, ninety-one towels, ninety-nine bars of soap, one hundred and thirty-seven packs of tooth powder, and forty-eight toothbrushes. This movement is continuing to expand in depth.

    中央局机关干部全体卷入生产热潮
    人人充满完成任务信心
    响应薄一波同志号召
    生产节约迎接光明
    【本报特讯】响应薄一波同志生产节约迎接光明的号召，中央局机关的干部们，全体卷进了生产节约运动。二月十号晚饭后，记者走遍了机关的各个部门，看到每个同志都在紧张的生产。
    中央局驻地东边的小学校，一群一群的男女同志、通讯员、小鬼们，正爬在三十多间墙壁的前面，用石灰把每垛墙壁洗刷得雪白。这是行政处、民运部、组织部、通讯班的同志们在替××大会筹委会包工生产。短短几天的劳动，他们已生产了一万八千五百元的财富。总支书、崔秘书和通讯班合组的互助包工小组，在三天内也刷了十九间房，挣工资洋八千九百元。记者同他们互助组的每个同志攀谈过，他们从来没有感到生产与工作会发生矛盾。崔秘书告诉记者：他们为了抽出通讯班同志更多的时间去生产，为了抽出互助组内一位同志去邢台学习手摇纺纱机，他必须在自己行政工作时间中抽出一部分，替通讯班收发信件，他的行政工作就不得不更加变得有计划和紧张了。最近，这个互助组又专门研究科学的按排每个同志工作的问题，他们发现还可以节省更多的人力去进行生产，而且他们部门的工作也更走上了合理化。
    记者跨进行政处的大院，很远就听到悠扬的纺车声，这是李叙五同志在纺花。在共产党人面前，困难从来就是不存在的。李叙五同志在中央局生产节约动员大会之后，没有丝毫犹豫，就选择了这门他过去没有作过的生产工作，并自动报名每天工余纺花三小时。他从八十里外背回纺车后，只下了一天苦工，就学会了纺花，而且每天可以纺一两半线。和他一样埋头纺花的，已有交通科、供给科、民运部、秘书处等部的同志们，他们新制了九部纺车。交通科已替老乡纺了半斤棉花，挣工资三百五十元。工作繁忙的陶秘书长，也花了三千块钱买回一部纺车，他保证每天要生产一小时。
    办公厅的研究室，干部和小鬼的生产是组织在一起，采取一揽子劳动的方式的。他们正在赶制笔记簿，靠着这项生产，研究室每个人的生产任务，很快就可以完成。他们明白的表示：在迅速完成生产任务之后，还要继续生产，建立家务。
    忙于生活事务的总务科的同志们也结合自己的业务进行着生产。全组八个人，八万块钱的生产任务，是靠生豆芽、种小菜、纺花、作酱去完成。最近十天中，他们已作了四十斤火腿、香肠出卖了，他们非常乐观的表示：在二月份内全部生产任务的二分之一即可以完成。
    民运部的同志们除纺花外，现正购买缝衣机，准备缝衣生产。宣传部、组织部的同志们，也正准备买一头骡子，替公家磨面。其他杂务员同志们，虽然因为工作的繁忙，没有规定生产任务，但他们为了减少公家的供给，也卷入了这一火热的生产节约运动中。
    记者走完了机关生产的各个部门，没有看见一个人不充满着完成生产任务的自信，他们在积极生产之外，正努力进行着节约。有的把全部供给的服装、津贴和日用品都节约了，有的除留少数日用品外，大部也进行了节约。根据各部极不完全的统计，全机关（缺两个部门）共节约津贴来二千七百四十公斤，单衣七套。节省棉衣的十七人，节省棉被的四十八人，夹鞋节省七十五双，袜三十五双、毛巾九十一条，肥皂九十九条，牙粉一百三十七包，牙刷四十八个。现这一运动正在继续深入的扩展。
