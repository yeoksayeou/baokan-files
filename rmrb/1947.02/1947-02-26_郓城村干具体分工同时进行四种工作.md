Yuncheng Village Cadres Divide Labor to Simultaneously Carry Out Four Tasks

[This Newspaper] After the liberation of Yuncheng's Second District, the masses were uneasy and the cadres were unable to start work. Currently, wartime support, land reform, taxation, and the selection of outstanding individuals are urgently needed. The district cadres' meeting discussed the combination and completion of these four tasks and decided to adopt the method of specific division of labor and simultaneous implementation. A district-wide village cadre meeting (including senior and junior teachers) was held to study how to specifically divide labor and leadership, determining that: the village chief, in charge of agricultural product taxation work, the self-defense captain, and the squad leaders would be responsible for wartime support, and the peasant association chairman would lead the emancipation movement. Through this scientific division of labor, significant achievements were made in the district within four days: the taxation work exceeded the original target by one-fourth, and the wartime support work resulted in a total of eighty-three carts and sixty-nine stretchers (exceeding the target by nine). Registration of military families is underway, and land reform is also being accelerated.

　　郓城村干具体分工同时进行四种工作
    【本报讯】郓城二区实行科学分工领导，四种任务同时完成。郓城解放后，二区群众情绪慌慌不定，干部工作无法入手，目前战勤、土地改革、征收、优秀等工作又急待进行。即在区干会上讨论四项工作结合与完成问题，决定采取具体分工，同时进行的办法。召开全区村干大会（内有高初级教员），研究如何具体分工领导，确定：村长、农产品征收工作、自卫队长、分队长担任战勤，农会长领导翻身，经此科学分工，全区四天内就有显著成绩；征收工作超过原定任务四分之一，战勤工作：共出大车八十三辆，担架六十九付（超任务九付）。军属登记正在进行，同时土地改革，亦在加紧进行。
