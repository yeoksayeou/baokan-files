[This dispatch is from the Jilu Yu Border Region, dated the 17th] The Yuncheng County Party Committee has called on good Party member cadres to perform meritorious service for the people in the land reform, and has established specific measures: 1. Land reform is the urgent demand of millions of peasants. Every Communist Party member must unconditionally put down all personal ideological burdens, bravely and resolutely participate in this earth-shaking mass movement, and perform meritorious service for the people in action. 2. The three major disciplines in land reform are: A. Do not take a single fruit from the masses, and do not harm the interests of the masses in the slightest. B. It is forbidden to accept or borrow anything from landlords to repay the masses for any reason. C. Do not take leave during land reform. 3. Standards for meritorious service: A. Be loyal to one's duties without avoiding difficulties and conscientiously complete tasks. B. Be good at following the mass line in work and have prestige among the masses. C. Consciously obey the organization and abide by discipline. 4. Competition conditions for each district: A. Complete the land reform task on time. B. In fully mobilizing the masses, 70% of the villages in the new area should mobilize 70% of the masses, and 30% of the villages should mobilize 90% of the masses. C. The land reform should be well combined with the mobilization work to ensure the completion of the support-the-front task. D. Establish accurate statistics in the land reform and promptly summarize experiences and write manuscripts. 5. Correctly grasp the policy towards the middle peasants.
　　
[This dispatch is from the Jilu Yu Border Region, dated the 17th] After the recovery of Juancheng, the evil landlord of Tuqiao Village was arrested, and the masses were enthusiastically engaged in a total "reckoning" with the traitors and bullies. Tuqiao Village had undergone rent reduction and interest reduction and anti-bullying movements, and the basic living conditions of the masses had been considerably improved, and the masses also had considerable organization. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Heze, the entire Ninth District launched a land reform movement, but before the land was distributed, the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived. The "Homecoming Corps" in the village returned home, threatening and beating the masses, and robbing the masses of the property they had received. Li Xingyu, the object of the struggle, committed even more atrocities, taking the lead in reversing the land and taking back the fruits. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops were driven away, Li Xingyu and other "reversing calculation" landlords pretended to be good people at home. Activists rose up to lead the struggle, but the masses still had concerns. The cadres arrested Li Xingyu and his son, and only then did the masses dare to move. A mass meeting was convened that night, and after deliberation and struggle, the fruits were returned. The fruits were immediately distributed, and the masses were in high spirits, saying, "Hum! What are we afraid of? Let's do it!" Other "reversing calculation" landlords asked the peasants' association to allow them to hand over what they had taken back. Now the masses are enthusiastically promoting land reform.
