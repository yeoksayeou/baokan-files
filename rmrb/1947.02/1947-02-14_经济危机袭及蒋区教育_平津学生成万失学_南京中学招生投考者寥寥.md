Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to a CNA dispatch on the 7th, the number of applicants for this semester's enrollment in Nanjing's secondary schools has broken previous records for its low numbers. According to statistics from eight private schools, there were only 102 high school applicants and 114 junior high applicants. CNA had to admit that this "sufficiently reflects the current economic difficulties and the general public's financial straits." Tuition fees at Nanjing middle schools are 200,000 (currency not specified), which most young people cannot afford. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, approximately 80,000 children in Tianjin are out of school. At Tsinghua University in Peiping, 36 students have requested leave of absence due to economic hardship or illness. Faculty and staff at Tangshan Institute of Technology have twice considered a general resignation due to excessively low salaries. In order to purchase winter coal, colleges and universities in Peiping and Tientsin have had to divert demobilization funds, so that the classrooms have gradually been heated, but the dormitories remain like ice caves. Tsinghua University President Mei Yi-qi said, "We will do as much as the government gives us money for."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: A dispatch from Peiping on the 1st: The local World Daily reports that education in the Northeast is suffering from a kind of "anemia." Academic books available in ordinary bookstores are too few; most are publications of a salacious nature, or else books promoting Kuomintang ideology. It also states that there is a lack of funding, teachers, and school buildings. Before November of last year, widespread teacher strikes prevailed throughout the Northeast. Teachers are issuing calls for survival in order to live.

    经济危机袭及蒋区教育
    平津学生成万失学
    南京中学招生投考者寥寥
    【新华社延安十日电】据中央社七日电：南京各中等学校本学期招生，考生之少，打破已往记录。据八个私立学校统计：高中考生仅一○二人，初中一一四人，对此中央社也不得不承认：“足以反映我当前经济的困难和一般人生活的窘迫。”南京各中学校学期收费二十万，大部分青年不能负担。另据天津大公报讯：津市失学儿童达八万左右。北平清华大学学生因经济困难，或生病请求休学的共三十六名。唐山工学院教职员因待遇太低，曾两度酝酿总辞职。平津各院校为添购冬煤，只得挪用复员费，教室的火，才算陆续生起，宿舍则仍如冰窟。清华校长梅贻琦说：“政府给我们多少钱，我们就做多少事。”
    【新华社延安十日电】北平一日讯：此间世界日报载称：东北教育正患一种“贫血病”。在普通书店中所能看到的学术用书太少，大部分都是黄色型的刊物，不然就都是党化书籍。又称：无论经费、师资、校舍都感缺乏，去年十一月以前流行性的罢教，遍布东北。教师们为了要活，发出求生的呼吁。
