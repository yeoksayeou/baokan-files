　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: According to Shanghai reports, the Tokyo "Mainichi Shimbun," representing Japanese Zaibatsu, recently openly repeated the old tune of "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China." The paper's January 11th editorial stated: "The economic prosperity of China and Japan should be closely linked." The future of China's economy depends less on industry and more on the exchange of agricultural products. Japan will manufacture necessities for the people of inland China." "China can supply Japan with salt, vegetables, oils, hemp, and fertilizer, while Japan will exchange textiles, bicycle parts, and seafood." The fact that Japanese wool fabrics and cotton yarn began to be dumped into China at the end of last year, and that the Kuomintang authorities decided to continuously ship large quantities of Chinese salt to Japan to meet Japanese industrial needs, proves that this plan has been actively underway for some time.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: According to a United Press report from Hong Kong on the 11th of last month: Japanese daily necessities are increasingly being shipped to Hong Kong, China. MacArthur Headquarters is now quite anxious to increase Japan's exports to various parts of the Far East in order to earn foreign exchange to meet Japan's main import and export needs. Japan's first batch of 2.2 million pounds of cotton yarn and 200 boxes of bicycles after the war have already arrived here. A large amount of rayon and cotton fabrics have also been ordered from Japan and will arrive here within two days.

　　日本财阀亟图侵略中国
    大批日货轮华倾销
    东京每日新闻重弹“农业中国工业日本”老调。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据沪报载，代表日本财阀之东京《每日新闻》报，最近公然重复“工业日本，农业中国”老调，该报一月十一日社论声称：“中日经济之繁荣应密切联系”，中国经济前途依赖于工业者少，而依赖于农业品之交换者多，日本将制造必需品以供中国内地人民应用”。“中国可供给日本食盐、蔬菜、油类、大麻、肥料，日本则以织物、脚踏车零件、海产品作为交换”。去年年底日本毛织物及棉纱等开始来华倾销，及国民党当局决定我国食盐不断大量运日，供日工业需要，证明此计划早在积极进行中。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据上月十一日合众社香港消息：日本日用品运往中国香港者日众，麦克阿瑟总部现颇急于增加日本对远东各地之出口货，用以换取外汇，作为日本主要进出口之需。日本战后第一批棉纱二百二十万磅，脚踏车二百箱，业已运抵此间。大量人造丝及棉织品亦已向日本定妥，两日内亦将运抵此间。
