Heroic Veteran Yu Yusuo Joins the Battle
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front of this newspaper] Heroic veteran Yu Yusuo has been with the army for five months without going home. Yu Yusuo is from the eighth district of Yuncheng. Since the Patriotic Self-Defense War broke out last year, he has followed the troops and taken on the glorious task of transporting ammunition. It has been more than five months, and he has never mentioned going home, persevering until now. When transporting ammunition, he takes great care of every bullet and shell, walking around the truck twice before going to sleep, and checking it again before dawn. He said, "Losing a bullet means I haven't fulfilled my responsibility and have failed to kill one less Chiang Kai-shek soldier." Every time he is asked why he doesn't go home for a break, he says, "The 'Central Army' burns, kills, and plunders everywhere. Anyone with a conscience should follow the Eighth Route Army and fight him (Chiang's army) to the end." During the battle of Shangguan Village last year, under such intense artillery fire, he automatically led the masses to the front line to deliver bullets, asking others to stand against the base of the wall to receive them while he transported them back and forth. Now he is asking to be issued a gun so that he can go to the battlefield to counterattack the enemy.

　　参战老英雄于玉所
    【本报冀鲁豫前线讯】参战老英雄于玉所随军五个月不回家。于玉所是郓城八区人，自去年爱国自卫战争打起来后，他就跟上部队，担任了运军火的光荣任务，现已五个多月了，他从来不提起回家，一直坚持到现在。在运军火时，他尽心爱护每一颗子弹和炮弹，睡以前要围车转两周，天不亮又到车旁检查一遍。他说：“丢一颗子弹就是自己没尽到责任，少打死一个小蒋介石。”每次问到他为什么不回家换班时，他说：“‘中央军’到处烧杀、糟蹋，只要有点人心的就要跟上八路军和他（蒋军）拚到底。”在去年上官村作战时，在那么激烈的炮火下，他自动的带领群众上火线送子弹，叫别人站在墙根下接手，他来回搬运。现在他又请求发给他枪，去上战场反击敌人。
