　　Yangyi Private Yufeng Bank Actively Supports Agricultural and Industrial Production
　　[Reported by our newspaper] The Yangyi Private Yufeng Bank was established in April of last year and has experienced significant business development over the year. Currently, it has received a total of 1,424,000 yuan in share capital. In addition to the 400,000 yuan investment from the Jinnan Bank Wu'an Branch, it has more than 1,000 shareholders, including over 200 merchant shareholders and 800 farmer shareholders. It regularly attracts deposits of over 1,500,000 yuan. The Jinnan and Ruihua Banks also strongly support it, providing interbank overdrafts that regularly amount to around 3,000,000 yuan. Therefore, in the nine months from April to the end of the year, it has loaned out a total of 49,340,000 yuan to 1,070 borrowers. Among these, 5,850,000 yuan were loaned for sideline occupations, 660,000 yuan for industry, 190,000 yuan for agriculture, and 24,525,000 yuan for small merchants and vendors. The number of borrowers and the amount loaned in these categories account for two-thirds of all borrowers and loans. As for large merchants, there were only 302 borrowers, with a total of 18,120,000 yuan loaned, which is less than one-third of the total. During the loan process, the bank personally studies the loan purpose in detail with the borrowers, informs them of economic information, and guides them in the correct direction of operation. As a result, these loans have played a significant supporting role in the production of impoverished masses. For example, among the 94 agricultural loans, 54 were from borrowers in this town. Adding their own funds, they collectively increased their livestock by 52 animals. There was a donkey driver in the town who borrowed 20,000 yuan and transported goods between Xingtai and Yangyi. Within two months, after repaying the principal, he had a net surplus of 1,500 jin of sea salt. He sold some of it and bought a donkey. By the end of last year, excluding the 50,000 yuan invested in a felt hat factory and the 200,000 yuan invested in Ruihua Bank, for which dividends have not yet been settled, the bank's loan interest income and the profits from its warehouse operations alone amounted to 2,940,000 yuan. After deducting 980,000 yuan in deposit interest paid and 260,000 yuan in bank expenses, the net profit was over 1,710,000 yuan. After deducting public reserve funds and public welfare funds, each share can still receive a dividend of over one yuan. (Xi Min)

　　阳邑民营裕丰银号
    积极扶植农工业生产
    【本报讯】阳邑民营裕丰银号于去年四月建立，年来业务有极大发展。目前共收到股金一百四十二万四千元，除冀南银行武安支行的投资四十万元外，共有股东一千多户，计商人股东二百多户，农民股东八百户。经常吸收存款在一百五十万元以上，冀南、瑞华两银行亦大力予以扶植，两行给予它的同业透支款，经常在三百万元左右。所以，从四月到年底的九个月内，便共贷出款达四千九百三十四万元，贷款户共一千零七十户。内中副业贷款五百八十五万元，工业贷款六十六万元，农业贷款十九万元，小商人及摊贩贷款二千四百五十二万五千元，以上贷款户数及贷到款数均占全部贷户及贷款的三分之二；至于大商人贷款只有三百零二户，共贷款一千八百十二万元，均不足全数的三分之一。在贷款时，银号并亲自与贷款者详细研究贷款用途，告诉他经济情报，指导他经营的正确方向；于是，这些贷款在生产上对于贫苦群众起了极大的支持作用。如九十四户农贷中，本镇的贷款者即有五十四户，加上他们自己的资金，共增加了五十二头牲口。该镇有一个驴夫，贷款二万元，往返于邢台和阳邑之间跑运输，两个月内，除归还原本，净剩海盐一千五百斤，他卖了一部分，换了一头驴。到去年年底为止，除投资毡帽工厂之五万元，及入股瑞华银行的二十万元，尚未结算出红利外，仅据该银号的贷款收息及兼营仓库的利润，初步结算的统计，共收入利息二百九十四万元，去掉付出存款利息九十八万元，及银号所有开支二十六万元外，净获纯利一百七十一万余元，再扣去公积金及公益金，每元股金仍可获得红利一元以上。（西民）
