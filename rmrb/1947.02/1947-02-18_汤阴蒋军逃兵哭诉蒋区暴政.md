　　(Taixing, This Newspaper, 16th) Duan Zhengcai, a new recruit of the Chiang army from Tangyin, unwilling to be cannon fodder for the civil war, recently ran to our liberated area and tearfully recounted to the democratic government his experience of being conscripted, saying: "I am from Changcun Village, Luoning County, Henan Province. My family has an old mother and a ten-year-old younger sister, and we all rely on me selling firewood to survive. The young and strong men in the village are afraid of being conscripted, so they all became 'local Eighth Route Army' (local people call the popular uprising armed forces 'local Eighth Route Army'). I thought I was the only son, so I wasn't afraid at home. Who would have thought that on November 14th last year, I was grabbed while selling firewood at the market. I was locked up in the first company of the new recruit camp in the county for more than twenty days before being taken away by train. After the Chiang puppets had grabbed enough more than 450 people in Luoning County, they were transported from the county to Tangyin." He said: "We were not allowed to move on the train. When we went out, the platoon leaders were on both sides, sandwiching us in the middle. When the new recruits arrived in Tangyin, the Kuomintang officers lectured the soldiers, saying: 'Don't dare to desert, or you will be beheaded or buried alive if you are caught by the Eighth Route Army.'" He said: "We didn't believe this nonsense. When the Eighth Route Army passed through my home, they bought and sold fairly and didn't scold or beat people. They didn't even touch the people's things. So I resolutely ran over here." He also said: "When the new recruits of the unit were transferred from Luoning to Tangyin, more than fifty people fled overnight when they camped at Yanqiu Town, Tangyin." Now Duan has been given travel expenses by our democratic government and sent home.

　　汤阴蒋军逃兵
    哭诉蒋区暴政
    【本报太行十六日电】汤阴蒋军新兵段正才，不愿作内战炮灰，日前跑来我解放区，并向民主政府痛哭陈述自己被抓经过称：“我是河南洛宁县长村人，家有老娘和十岁的妹妹，全靠我卖柴养活，村里的青壮年怕抓兵，都当了土八路（当地人民称民变武装为土八路），我觉得我是孤子单丁，在家不怕，谁想去年十一月十四日，我到集上卖柴，突被抓走，在县里新兵营一连关了二十余天，才让火车拉走。蒋伪于洛宁县抓够四百五十多人后，始由该县运至汤阴。”他说：“在车上动也不许动，出去时，两边是班排长把我们夹在中间。新兵开到汤阴时，国民党的军官又给士兵训话说：‘千万不敢开小差，叫八路军抓住不是杀头就是活埋。’他说：‘我们都不相信这鬼话，八路军从我家走过，公买公卖不打不骂，老百姓的东西动都不动。所以我坚决跑过来。”并称：“该部新兵由洛宁开往汤阴，路经汤阴延秋镇宿营时，一夜即逃跑五十余人。”现段已由我民主政府发给路费遣送回家。
