In Southern Shanxi, there's a heroic story circulating: "A single tiger blocks a flock of sheep." Since December, the people of Southern Shanxi have continuously crushed the destructive sweeps of the 31st Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army three times. Wang Qiye, the militia captain of Qian Gou, is the most outstanding hero to emerge from this. When four thousand soldiers of the 31st Brigade invaded Qian Gou, Wang Qiye led fourteen militiamen from his village to resolutely resist. He himself guarded the strategic mountain pass behind Qian Gou, single-handedly and calmly resisting more than four thousand enemies. After fighting for about two hours, he killed or wounded six enemies. After covering the evacuation of the people, he safely withdrew.
