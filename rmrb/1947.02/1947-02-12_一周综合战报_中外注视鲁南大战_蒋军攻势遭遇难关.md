    Weekly Comprehensive War Report
    The Lu Nan Battle Attracts Attention at Home and Abroad
    Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive Encounters Difficulties
    February 2nd to 8th
    During this week, the development of the Second Battle of Lu Nan has drawn close attention from people at home and abroad. A large number of reporters from Shanghai and Nanjing have arrived in Xuzhou, indicating that everyone understands the importance of this battle in Lu Nan.
    In this offensive, Chiang Kai-shek invested 200,000 troops, gathering most of the forces that could be drawn from the battlefields of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Jiangsu-Anhui to Lu Nan. Chiang Kai-shek himself personally went to Xuzhou and Zhengzhou on the 2nd and 4th to arrange the offensive. According to Chiang Kai-shek's past historical pattern, whenever he personally takes command of the battle, it is the most critical moment of the war situation. Chiang Kai-shek has reached a new juncture.
    Chiang Kai-shek used 22 brigades and six regiments in the front line of Lu Nan, as well as the air force and special forces that could be used. Since the northern invasion from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway began on the 26th of last month, Chiang's propaganda machine has been exaggerating and fabricating victories, claiming that Chen Yi's troops only "surrendered" or "fled," which is completely like shouting loudly while walking in the dark, just to embolden themselves. In fact, after passing Tancheng, Chiang's army did not dare to advance rashly. The Central News Agency had to admit on the 4th of this month that it was a "stalemate." The Associated Press also saw that if Chiang's army advanced further, "a major resistance is inevitable." The Central News Agency itself reported that fierce fighting had taken place southeast of Tancheng on the 6th and 7th, probably they had initially tasted the flavor of resistance. The Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station shamelessly spread rumors that street fighting had broken out in Linyi, but on the 8th, the United Press International sent a telegram from Nanjing saying: "The official news that the government forces have entered Linyi and are engaged in street fighting is likely premature."
    Not only that, but the rear of Chiang's army in Lu Nan has been completely exposed. The vast area south of Xuzhou is thinly guarded by Chiang's army. Although they cut flesh to mend sores and transferred the Fifth Army and the 75th Division from the Daming area, abandoning the long-touted "Daming Victory," the large army under General Liu Bocheng crossed the Longhai Railway, preventing the Fifth Army and others from advancing or retreating. They also sent troops south to eastern Henan and northern Anhui, and successively recovered the five cities of Zhecheng, Taikang, Qi County, Luyi, and Bo County from the 30th of last month to the 2nd of this month. The battle results in Luyi and Bo County alone eliminated 6,000 Chiang's troops, causing the Central News Agency to exclaim in alarm that "Liu Bocheng's troops are moving eastward."
    Chiang's 12th Army under the command of Wang Luowu, led by Huo Shouyi, occupied Wucheng on the 5th, attempting to coordinate with Lu Nan. But he probably wouldn't consider how the New Fourth Army along the Jiaoji Railway would arrange him any less than Chen Cheng.
    Another shocking battlefield for Chiang Kai-shek is in central Shanxi. After the Eighth Route Army recovered Wenshui City, more than 70 kilometers southwest of Taiyuan, on the 2nd, Yan Xishan's weakness became more apparent. Chiang Kai-shek took the opportunity to annex Yan Xishan, and it was widely rumored in Taiyuan that Chiang Kai-shek wanted Yan Xishan to go to Nanjing to take on a "new position."
    The following situation shows that Chiang's army also finds it difficult to maintain the Pingjin transportation. After the Eighth Route Army once captured Anding Station and Weishanzhuang Station on the Beining Railway, more than 100 miles southeast of Beiping, on the 2nd of last month, it liberated Wanzhuang Station southeast of Anding on the 31st and once attacked Lutai Station, 40 miles north of Tianjin, on the 5th of this month. Tianjin's transportation is the artery of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war transportation in North China. If the civil war continues, he will find that military transportation between Beiping and Tianjin will become increasingly inconvenient.
    The Liaodong Democratic Allied Army crushed Chiang's army's second offensive against the Linjiang area of ​​Andong Province in four days from the 5th to the 8th. The 195th Division of Chiang's 52nd Army lost more than half of its strength, with more than 2,000 people annihilated, and the 107th Division of the New Sixth Army was also wiped out.
    The Eighth Route Army recovered the eight cities of Daming, Neihuang, Taikang, Qi County, Luyi, Zhecheng, Bo County, and Wenshui this week, but this week was only "minor contact." (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th)

### 一周综合战报  中外注视鲁南大战  蒋军攻势遭遇难关

    一周综合战报
    中外注视鲁南大战
    蒋军攻势遭遇难关
    二月二日至八日
    这一周中，鲁南第二次大战的发展，引起了国内外人士的密切注意。大批京沪新闻记者已到徐州，说明大家都了解鲁南此次战役之重要。
    蒋介石在这次攻势中，投入了二十万兵力，几乎把冀鲁豫和苏皖两战场上能抽掉的部队，大部集结到了鲁南。蒋介石自己也在二日与四日先后亲到徐州、郑州布置进攻。按照蒋介石过去的历史规律，凡是他亲自出马指挥作战的时候，就是战局最危急的时候，蒋介石又走到了一个新的关口。
    蒋介石在鲁南第一线使用了廿二个旅又六个团的兵力，以及所可能使用的空军和特种兵。自上月廿六日开始由陇海东段北犯以来，蒋记宣传机关自己虚张声势捏造战果，不是说陈毅部只有“投降”，就是说只有“逃窜”，这完全是黑夜走路大喊叫，只是为了给自己壮胆。事实上，蒋军过郯城后即不敢冒然前进，中央社到本月四日也不能不承认是“相持状态”了。美联社也看到蒋军如再前进，“难免有大抵抗”。中央社自己报导六、七两日郯城东南方已发生激战，大概他们已初步尝到抵抗的味道了。南京中央广播电台竟厚颜无耻的造谣说临沂已发生巷战，但八日合众社却由南京发出电讯称：“官方消息所称政府军已进入临沂正在巷战的谣言当嫌过早。”
    不仅如此，鲁南蒋军的后方已经完全暴露出来了，徐州以南的广大地区，蒋军十分单薄，虽挖肉补疮从大名一带调回第五军和七十五师等部，放弃了吹嘘多时的“大名胜利”。然而刘伯承将军麾下大军却横跨陇海路，使第五军等进退不得；并遣师南下豫东、皖北，自上月三十日迄本月二日连续收复柘城、太康、杞县、鹿邑、亳县五城，仅鹿邑、亳县两役战果，即消灭蒋军六千人，使中央社不能不惊呼“刘伯承部正向东移动”。
    王罗武指挥下的蒋军十二军霍守义部，于五日侵占了芜城，企图策应鲁南，但他对于胶济路沿线的新四军会对他如何安排，大概不会比陈诚更少考虑吧。
    蒋介石另一吃惊战场在晋中，八路军于二日收复太原西南七十余公里之文水城后，阎锡山弱点益露，蒋介石乘机欲并吞阎锡山，太原已盛传蒋介石要阎锡山到南京另就“新职”了。
    下述情况，显示平津交通蒋军也不易维持了。八路军继上月二日一度攻克北平东南百余里北宁路上之安定车站及魏善庄车站之后，复于三十一日解放安定东南之万庄车站，并于本月五日一度攻入天津北四十里之芦台车站。天津交通是蒋介石华北内战运输的动脉，内战如果继续下去，他将会发现北平、天津间的军事运输将愈来愈不便。
    辽东民主联军自五日迄八日四天内，粉碎了蒋军对安东省临江地区的第二次进攻，蒋军五十二军一九五师损失过半，被歼二千余人，而新六军一○七师亦被歼一个团。
    八路军这一周收复大名、内黄、太康、杞县、鹿邑、柘城、亳县、文水八城，但这一周还只有“小接触”。（新华社延安十日电）
