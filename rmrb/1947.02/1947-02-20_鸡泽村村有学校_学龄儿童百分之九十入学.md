[This article was] transmitted by our newspaper from Southern Hebei on the 9th: As a result of the land reform, national education in Jize County has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past year. Primary schools have increased from 20 at the time of liberation to 100, and senior primary schools have increased from one to four. Of the county's 146 administrative villages, every village except for eight or nine small villages in the border areas has a school. Some small villages have also established schools by merging villages. The number of enrolled children accounts for 90% of the county's school-age children, reaching 9,535. The basic experiences of education work in the past year are: First, a large number of teachers have been trained. There are already 128 enthusiastic teachers who are beloved by the masses. These teachers are rural intellectuals who are enthusiastic about education after short-term training. They teach students in practical work, and they also learn at any time. Many teachers can humbly ask others for advice when they have difficulties. Comrade Li Yuting, a teacher from Dongbeizhuang, has only been to school for three years, but he teaches very well, and the masses and students support him very much. Comrades such as Yang Chunsheng and Liu Changhao have improved the school while teaching and learning, and have created many teaching experiences. Second, the new education policy has been implemented. During the spring production last year, the teachers in each village not only carried out production education for the students, but also implemented the every-other-day system, the every-other-shift system, and the small-teacher system according to the opinions of the masses, so that every child could go to school and study outside the school according to the family situation, so that 80% of the students participated in family production. Comrade Zhao Qin from Mubao Village in the Fourth District led 80 students to leach more than 1,000 jin of salt in half a month, and organized mutual aid groups with ten relatively large students to plant 112 mu of land, harvesting more than 5,000 jin of grain, 2,200 jin of cotton, and 2,500 jin of radishes. Girls also carried spinning wheels into the school, spinning while reading, and many primary schools became textile factories, which greatly encouraged farmers to send their children to school. In the mass movement, teachers and students were involved in the struggle of farmers to turn themselves over, reasoning and settling accounts with landlords together with the masses, and they compiled many songs according to different characters. Teachers also took time out of their busy schedules to lead the "radio station" and mass blackboard, and also compiled more than 100 songs and fast clapper rhymes.

　　鸡泽村村有学校
    学龄儿童百分之九十入学
    【本报冀南九日电】由于经过土地改革，鸡泽去年一年中，国民教育突飞猛进，小学由解放时二十处增至一百处，高小由一处增至四处，全县一百四十六个行政村，除八九个边沿区小村外，村村有学校，有些小村也用并村办法建立了学校，入学儿童占全县学龄儿童百分之九十，达九千五百三十五名。一年以来，教育工作的基本经验：第一是大量培养师资，已有了一百二十八个热心教育的教师，这些教师都是群众爱戴的农村小知识分子，他们经过短期的训练，对教育事业非常热情，他们在实际工作中教育学生，自己也随时学习。许多教员有疑难时都能虚心求教别人。东北庄教员李玉亭同志，只上过三年学，但他教的很好，群众学生都很拥护。如杨春生、刘昌浩等同志，都是在一面教一面学当中，把学校也提高了，并创造了许多教学经验。第二是实现了新教育方针。去年春季生产时，各村教员不仅对学生进行了生产教育，并根据群众意见，实行了隔日制、隔晌制、小先生制，使每个儿童都能根据家庭情况到学校里读书和在校外读书，使百分之八十的学生都参加了家庭生产。四区慕堡村赵勤同志，带领学生八十人，在半月内淋盐一千多斤，并以十个比较大的学生组织了互助组，种地一百一十二亩，收粮五千余斤，棉花二千二百斤，萝卜二千五百斤。女生也搬着纺车走进了学校，一面纺线，一面读书，许多小学变成了纺织工厂，大大鼓励了农民送子弟入学。在群运中，教员和学生都卷入了农民翻身斗争，和群众一起对地主说理、算账，他们并按照不同的人物，编了许多歌子。教师们在百忙中还抽出时间，领导“广播台”、大众黑板，还编了百多篇歌曲、快板。
