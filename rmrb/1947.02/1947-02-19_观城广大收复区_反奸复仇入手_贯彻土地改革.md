    [Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, 17th] The land reform movement in Guancheng County had just begun when it was interrupted by the war. When the enemy retreated after the Lunar New Year, the County Party Committee immediately convened a meeting to study the situation in the county. Most villages had not yet fully implemented land reform (the Fourth District was largely completed). It specifically proposed the policy of "starting with suppressing traitors and revenge, and fully implementing the land-returning-to-home movement." It also pointed out that the propaganda offensive should be combined with the government's clear policy of eliminating traitors to support the people, so as to dispel the masses' concerns. The meeting also discussed the past "leniency" that had alienated the masses, leading to thoughts among many village and even district cadres of resorting to "going too far" by killing bad elements and suppressing local bullies, and their reluctance to hand them over to the government. County Head Shen stated that this time, they were determined to follow the mass line and implement the policy of eliminating traitors. All districts could arrest all the bad elements who were present when the enemy was there, and the county government would handle them according to the opinions of the masses. He also pointed out that support must be proactive, timely, and specific. All cadres clearly used the thought of land reform to guide the struggle against traitors and revenge, and carried out the struggle against traitors and revenge together with the calculation of exploitation accounts, so as to implement land reform.

    [Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, 17th] In Guancheng, after the leadership accepted the new spirit of the civil affairs work forum and proposed boldly and resolutely supporting the masses, the mass movement became extremely active. Currently, more than 2,000 activists throughout the county are gathering. The First District has already arrested more than 40 secret agents and "homecoming corps" members. The women of Macun automatically demanded the bad elements detained by the district to be brought out for street struggle. The high tide of the mass movement throughout the county will soon arrive. All cadres in the county are determined and confident to throw themselves into the struggle with a spirit of meritorious service.
