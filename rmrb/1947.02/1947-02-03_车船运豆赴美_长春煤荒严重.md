Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: According to a Changchun dispatch in the Tianjin Yishibao on the 8th of this month, the reason for the coal shortage in Changchun is not the lack of coal, but the lack of transportation. The railway bureau uses a large number of vehicles to transport soybeans to Huludao for shipment to the United States. The cold suffered by the citizens of Changchun at minus 30 degrees is of no concern to them. Most of the factories taken over by the Kuomintang have stopped working. "Changchun is not an industrial city, but already 20,000 workers have lost their jobs." The market is flooded with American cigarettes, canned goods, clothing, cosmetics, stationery, etc., while the number of refugees and unemployed students is increasing daily, and those in need of relief account for about one-tenth of the city's population.

    长春煤荒严重
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据本月八日天津益世报长春通讯称：长春正闹着煤荒的原因不是没有煤，而是没有车运，铁路局大批车辆都运了大豆到葫芦岛装船去美国。而在零下三十度的长春市民的寒冷是不在他们心上的。经过国民党接收的工厂大半停了工。“长春不是一个工业城市，可是已经有两万多工人失了业”。市面上源源而来的是美国的香烟、罐头、衣料、化装品、文具等，成群难民与失学失业者则与日俱增，需要救济的人约占全市人口十分之一。
