Big Tyrant Tai Wenqing Pays for Murder with His Life
Tai Village Masses Demand Blood Debt
[Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 14th] After the Dong'e County government executed the big tyrant and murderer Tai Wenqing, the masses in Tai Village have begun to mobilize and carry out land reform. The village farmers' association was very weak in the past, for two reasons: First, during the democratic struggle last year, the government failed to meet the urgent demands of the masses in handling the problem of the evil landlord Tai Wenqing. The evil tyrant Tai Wenqing personally killed six people. At that time, the masses demanded a life for a life, but the government failed to respond to the demands of the masses. The masses were afraid that the evil tyrant would regain power and kill them, so the farmers' association was not enthusiastic. Second, when mobilizing the masses at that time, one-sided emphasis was placed on taking the path of tenant farmers and the poor. In a village of more than 300 households, there were only more than 130 members. The members did not believe in their own strength. When the district cadre talked to the village cadres about their work, the village cadre held up his thumb and said, "This obstacle cannot be removed, and land reform in this village cannot be done." After understanding the situation, we first held a meeting of activists. Bitter plaintiff Tai Lanqing said: "My family of seven, four were killed by the evil tyrant Tai Wenqing. The most painful thing is that my sister-in-law was shot seven times. I went to relatives' and friends' houses to hide. My motherless niece was only seventeen years old and was taken over by the evil element Zhang Zhengxiu. The family was in ruins." She cried and asked everyone: "Brothers, if you can avenge me, I will never forget your kindness for the rest of my life." At this time, the whole audience expressed their indignation and vowed to resolutely seek revenge. After three or four days of brewing, the masses took enthusiastic action. At a conference of three or four thousand people, the victims complained, and the government, based on the opinions of the masses, executed the evil tyrant Tai Wenqing by firing squad. The masses immediately confiscated his family property and divided the fruits. Their emotions were very high, and they are now continuing to discuss how to carry out land reform.

　　大恶霸泰汶清杀人偿命
    泰庄群众索回血债
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】东阿县府枪毙大恶霸杀人犯泰汶清后，泰庄群众已开始动起来进行土地改革。该村农会过去很疲塌，原因有二：一、去年民主斗争时，政府在处理恶霸地主泰汶清问题上，未能满足群众的迫切要求。恶霸泰汶清亲手杀死六条人命，当时群众要求偿命，但政府未能答复群众要求，群众怕恶霸再当权来杀害自己，因此农会不起劲。二、当时发动群众，片面强调走佃贫路线，在三百多户的村子里，只有会员一百三十余名。会员不相信自己力量。区干与村干部谈工作时，村干大姆指一伸说：“这个障碍去不了，这村的土地改革是不能办的。”情况了解以后，首先开积极分子会，苦主泰兰青说：“我一家大小七口，被恶霸泰汶清打死整四口，最痛心的是我大嫂挨了七枪，我到亲友家躲避，我那无妈的侄女才十七岁，又被恶霸分子张正秀霸占，家中弄的七零八散。”她哭泣着向大家要求：“兄弟爷们要能为我报仇雪恨，我一辈子忘不了你们的恩情”。这时全场同声愤慨，并宣誓坚决复仇。经过三四天的酝酿，群众热烈行动起来，在三四千人的大会上，苦主诉了苦，政府根据群众的意见，将恶霸泰汶清执行枪决。群众即将其家产没收，分了果实，情绪非常高涨，现在正继续讨论如何进行土地改革。
