　　Exorbitant Taxes and Levies Abound
　　Even Landlords with 5,000 Mu of Land Find it Hard to Survive
　　— People in the New Yu-Wan-Su Area Voice Their Grievances
　　[Our newspaper's front-line dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 21st] The people in the newly recovered areas of Ningling and other counties in the Yu-Wan-Su area south of the Longhai Railway are successively denouncing the Kuomintang's tyrannical rule. During the period of the KMT military occupation, the area suffered from exorbitant taxes and levies and the forced conscription of soldiers, plunging the masses into dire straits. Even landlords owning 500 Qing of land found it impossible to survive due to the oppressive taxes. In addition to the heavy taxes on land and business, the KMT military also extracted levies for conscripts, the Three People’s Principles Youth League, KMT party fees, propaganda expenses, and comfort fees, with a multitude of different categories. Last year's wheat harvest yielded only 70 Jin per Mu, of which as many as 45 Jin were confiscated. Even impoverished scavengers had to pay more than 2,000 Yuan in taxes each month. Some villages were even taxed three times a month. Many peasants were unable to pay the taxes, and their land was seized by KMT military officers, county magistrates, township chiefs, and Bao heads. The peasants said angrily: "The land will eventually belong to those people anyway, so we might as well block up our doors and flee to other places to escape the hardship." Secondly, the KMT military carried out large-scale conscription, with each Bao required to provide 10 to 20 men. In order to avoid being drafted, young men dared not stay at home for long periods of time, even sleeping in the snow on snowy days. One old man in Zhecheng cut off two of his fingers to avoid military service. After our army recovered the area, it first carried out relief work. The Eighth Route Army also helped the peasants to emancipate themselves during breaks in the fighting and prepared to carry out land reform. In addition, those who were seized by the KMT military as soldiers were released; in Luyi County alone, hundreds of people were repatriated.

　　苛捐杂税名目繁多
    五千亩地主也难活
    ——豫皖苏新区人民诉冤屈
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】陇海路南豫皖苏区宁陵等县新收复区人民纷纷控诉蒋家暴政。在蒋军侵占期间，该地苛捐奇重、强拉壮丁，群众生活陷于绝境。拥有五十顷地的地主亦因捐税所逼，无法为生。蒋军除苛征地亩营业各税外，并索取壮丁捐、三青团捐、国民党党费、宣传费、慰劳费等，名目繁多。去年麦收每亩仅七十斤，竟被征去四十五斤。拾荒贫民每月也要纳税两千元以上。有的村庄竟一月纳税三次。农民多因无力缴税，土地多被蒋军军官、县长、乡长、保长等霸占。农民们愤激地说：“地早晚都是那批人的，咱们不如早早垒上门子到外面去逃难。”其次蒋军大量抽丁，每保要抽十人至廿人。为了逃避抓丁，青壮年长期不敢在家，大雪天还躲在雪地里睡觉。柘城一位老百姓自己断去两个手指，逃避兵役。我军收复该地区后，首先进行救济工作。八路军在战斗空隙中并帮助农民翻身，准备进行土地改革。此外并释放被蒋军抓去壮丁，仅鹿邑一县即遣放数百人。
