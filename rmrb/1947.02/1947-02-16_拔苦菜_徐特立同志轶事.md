　　Pulling Bitter Herbs
    Anecdotes of Comrade Xu Teli
    "Bitter herbs are really hard to eat, so bitter and astringent... I'd rather not eat than eat bitter herbs!" This was the cry of some comrades during the drought prevention and famine preparation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1945. However, Elder Xu did not have such sentiments. It is said that in 1936, when Elder Xu was the Minister of Education of the Soviet government in northern Shaanxi, he was already an old man in his sixties, but every day after work, he led the comrades from the Ministry of Education to the mountains to pick bitter herbs. One evening, a comrade returning from a walk in the fields saw them pulling bitter herbs and advised them:
    "Elder Xu, you are so old, bitter herbs are not good for you, they are hard to digest and can easily cause stomach problems. Doesn't the government provide special care for you in terms of living arrangements?..."
    Before they could finish speaking, the comrades who were also pulling herbs said in unison with some complaints: "We advised him not to come and pull bitter herbs, but he insisted on coming. The mountains are high, and the herbs are bitter. Eating them is hard to digest..."
    "No, no, bitter herbs are delicious, I have eaten them, it's okay... Northern Shaanxi is originally poor in land and people, with a small population, coupled with years of drought and civil war, everyone is very difficult. Everyone is a revolutionary comrade, all the same, how can I enjoy special treatment?! Hehe, bitter herbs are delicious, delicious, it's okay..." Elder Xu said, chuckling, while bowing his head to pull bitter herbs.
    After this incident spread, it played a considerable role in saving and enduring hardship at that time. Some comrades even said with emotion: "Elder Xu is truly arduous, treating bitter herbs as delicacies."

　　拔苦菜
    徐特立同志轶事
    “苦菜真难吃又苦又涩口……我宁肯不吃饭，也不愿吃苦菜!”这是一九四五年陕甘宁边区防旱备荒时某些同志的呼声，可是徐老确没有这样的情绪。听说，一九三六年，徐老在陕北任苏维埃政府教育部长时，已是六十高龄的老人，可是每天工作余暇还领着教育部的工作同志到山上采苦菜。一天黄昏，从田里散步回来的同志，看他们正在拔苦菜，就劝他们：
    “徐老，你这样大的年纪，苦菜不能吃，吃了不消化，易得肠胃病，公家对你老人家在生活上不是另有照顾吗？……”
    没有等他们把话说完，同在拔菜的同志异口同声地带些埋怨说：“我们劝他不要来拔苦菜，他一定来，山又高，菜又苦，吃了还不消化……”
    “不，不，苦菜好吃，我吃过，没关系，……陕北本来地薄民贫，人口又少，加以年年灾荒内战，大家都很困难，大家都是革命同志，都是一样，我那能例外享受呢？！嘿嘿，苦菜好吃，好吃，没关系……”徐老一面嘿嘿地笑着，一面又低头拔苦菜。
    这事传出去后，对于当时的节约与吃苦起了相当作用。有些同志甚至感动的说：“徐老真艰苦，苦菜当山珍。”（摘自彭涛同志作《徐老的二三事》，原载冀南日报）
