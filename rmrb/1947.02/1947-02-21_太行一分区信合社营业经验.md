Operational Experience of Credit Cooperatives in the First District of Taihang

The rural credit cooperatives in the First District have gained preliminary operational experience: (1) Through propaganda and education, idle funds from the masses are absorbed. After the group movement in Gufang Village, Shahe, the leadership proposed the establishment of a credit cooperative, explaining to the masses that credit cooperatives serve production and are the best form of "labor-capital combination." The cooperative was established in this village on November 28th last year, and within a month, it received 542,375 yuan in deposits from the masses. On the 18th day of the lunar month of December, it received 1,330 yuan in one day. An old widow said, "I'll deposit 3,000 yuan first, and then deposit more when I sell my wheat." By the end of the year, it had received more than 700,000 yuan in deposits. After learning about the disadvantages of "money without labor – idle money; labor without money – idle people," the masses in Beizhang Village voluntarily established a credit cooperative. In Gaoyi Chengguan Credit Cooperative, Wang Ren, the head of household registration, and the village head took the lead in depositing 6,000 yuan, which aroused the masses to deposit, and 126,000 yuan were received in five days. After using the education of "digging out the roots of poverty," "planting the roots of wealth," and "defeating the reactionaries and living a good life" in Zan Huangjialin Credit Cooperative, the cooperative, agricultural members, elementary school, and children's corps and women deposited a total of 858,470 yuan, which exceeded the original estimate of 300,000 yuan by two and a half times. (2) Loans are closely linked to agricultural and sideline industries and are focused on key areas. Because Gufang Village is close to the main road, it is suitable for transportation in winter. The credit cooperative loaned more than 410,000 yuan to the masses to buy 13 pack animals. Each animal earns more than 400 yuan a day. As a result, the loans have now been repaid, and the animals can be used as an important foundation for this year's large-scale production movement. Yangjiazhai Credit Cooperative in Yuanshi loaned more to porters because it was not far from Zanhuang City. Li Ruixiang and Yang Jinghong borrowed 30,000 yuan to carry pot lids and oil. Since the beginning of December, they have earned 12,000 yuan in foreign currency four times. Li Ruixiang said to others: "If it weren't for the credit cooperative, I would still be staring blankly." (3) Deposit and loan methods are geared towards the interests of the masses. The Beizhang Village Credit Cooperative can lend enough money to porters to buy a pack animal at one time, but the earned porterage can be returned in installments, which is called "taking out in lump sums and repaying in installments." Zanhuang Yecaozhi Credit Cooperative loaned Zhai Zhenfang 10,000 yuan for transportation. Zhai earned 6,300 yuan net in ten days. After deducting 400 yuan in interest, the remainder was deposited in the credit cooperative to earn interest, which is called "lending the capital (the capital of production) and depositing the profit (the profit of production)." In addition, Gufang Village Credit Cooperative also has methods such as "depositing in installments and withdrawing in lump sums" and "depositing in installments and withdrawing in installments," which are convenient for the masses. (4) Credit cooperatives can make money by serving the masses. For example, according to one month's calculation, Yangjiazhai Credit Cooperative in Yuanshi had a total income of 24,556 yuan in interest and a total expenditure of 9,351 yuan in loan (bank) and deposit interest. The net profit was 15,205 yuan.

　　太行一分区信合社营业经验
    一分区农村信用合作社取得营业初步经验：（一）经过宣传教育，吸收群众游资。沙河固坊村群运一结果，领导上即提出成立信用社，向群众说明信用社是为生产服务的，也是“劳资结合”的最好组织形式。该村社去年十一月二十八号成立，一月内收到群众五十四万二千三百七十五元存款，阴历腊月十八，一天就收到一千三百三十元，一个老寡妇说：“我先存三千元，等我把麦子卖了再存”。到年底已收到存款七十多万。北掌村群众于了解到“有钱无劳力——闲钱；有劳力无钱——闲人”的坏处后，便自动成立信用社。高邑城关信用社因户籍王任和村长打头炮入款六千元，引起群众存款，五天收到存款十二万六千元。赞皇家林信用社用“挖穷根”、“栽富根”、“打退反动派过好光景”教育群众后，合作社、农会员、小学校及儿童团、妇女共存款八十五万八千四百七十元，超过原估计三十万元的两倍半。（二）放款紧紧结合农副业，并采取重点。固坊村因临大道，冬季宜作运输，信用社即贷款四十一万余元给群众买牲口十三头驮脚，每一牲口一天赚四百多元，结果现已还清了贷款、牲口即可作为今年大生产运动的重要基础。元氏杨家寨信用社因离赞皇城不远，多贷款些脚夫。李瑞祥和杨晶红贷款三万，挑锅盖、担油，十二月初起，四次即赚洋一万二千元。李瑞祥对人说：“要不是信用社，我还是干瞪眼”。（三）为群众利益着眼的存款、贷款方法。北掌村信用社贷款给脚夫买牲口，可以一次贷给足够买一匹牲口的钱，但运脚中可把赚下的脚价零星归还，这叫“整取零还”。赞皇野草之信用社贷给翟振芳运输款一万元，翟运输十天净赚六千三百元，除出息四百元，余作“存款”放进信用社生息，这叫做贷本（生产之本）存到（生产之利）”。此外，固坊村信用社还有“零存整取”、“零存零取”等办法，群众无不称便。（四）信用社为群众服务就能赚钱。如元氏杨家塞信用社，据一个月计算，共收入利息二万四千五百五十六元、共出贷款（银行）及存款息九千三百五十一元，纯利收入为一万五千二百零五元。
