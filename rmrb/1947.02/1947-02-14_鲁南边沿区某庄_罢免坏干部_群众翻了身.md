Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th. In a certain village in a certain county bordering the Chiang-occupied area in Southern Shandong, bad cadres were dismissed and land reform was quickly completed amidst intense war preparations. Since the spring of 1944, work in this village had been hampered because village cadres like Zhu and others forgot their origins after being liberated, were bought off by landlords, and failed to thoroughly liberate poor peasants. At the beginning of this year, district cadres discovered this problem and immediately conducted land reform education among the masses, promoting new activists like Leng Xinde to establish a land distribution committee. Within seven days, 129 mu of land and 5 mu of gardens were recovered, and the land and population of the entire village were calculated equally, with 2 mu per person as the standard, compensating those with less from those with more, so that everyone had land. After obtaining land, the masses were in high spirits. The bad cadres, like Zhu, showed no remorse and even threatened the masses, saying, "Who dares to divide my land?" The masses were not afraid and dismissed them at a village meeting, electing Leng Xinde, who truly served the masses. This time, the front line needed supplies, and the entire village worked together to make 100 jin of fried cakes overnight and send them to the front.

    鲁南边沿区某庄
    罢免坏干部
    群众翻了身
    【新华社山东九日电】鲁南接近蒋占区的某县某庄，在紧张备战中罢免了坏干部，迅速完成土地改革。该村工作自四四年春后，由于村干部祝某等翻身后忘本，受地主收买，致贫苦农民未得彻底翻身。本年初区干部发现这一问题，立即对群众进行土地改革教育，提拔新积极分子冷心德成立土地分配委员会。七天内收回土地一百二十九亩、场园五亩，并将全庄土地人口平均计算，每人以二亩为标准，以多补少，做到人人有地。群众获地后，情绪极高，坏干部祝某等不知悔悟，反威胁群众说：“谁敢分我的地？”群众不为所惧，在村民大会上将其罢免，选出真心为群众服务的冷心德。此次前线需要给养，全村一齐动手，一夜办好一百斤油饼送往前方。
