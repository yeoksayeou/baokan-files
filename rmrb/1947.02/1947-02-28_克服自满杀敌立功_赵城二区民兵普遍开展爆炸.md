　　Overcoming Complacency to Kill the Enemy and Render Meritorious Service
    Zhao Cheng Second District Militiamen Universally Launch Explosions
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch] The militiamen of the Second District of Zhao Cheng, due to overcoming pride and complacency, have immediately seen a significant shift in tactics and are now launching an explosion campaign. In the past, the district's militia rotation team was equipped with machine guns, grenade launchers, and other weapons, coupled with District Armed Forces Committee Director Comrade Zhang Yi's marksmanship, which was unfailing. Having repelled Yan's troops several times in Mingjiang and other places, the militiamen gradually became arrogant, believing that planting landmines was not as satisfying as using machine guns, and burying stone mines was not as impressive as wielding rifles. Therefore, they only superficially complied with the higher authorities' instructions to launch explosions. Since suffering an enemy attack in Mingjiang a month ago, their thinking has begun to change. Comrade Zhang Yi personally studied the higher authorities' instructions on explosions, researched mine laying techniques with Guo Changwa, who had received explosion training, and laid stone mines with the Anze rotation militiamen in Hou Village, demonstrating the explosive power on the spot. At this time, militiamen Zhang Yongsheng and Zhang Huatong also used stone mines to destroy a truck of the diehard army near Shupu, making everyone believe that explosions could kill and injure the enemy, and the morale of the militiamen immediately improved. Comrade Zhang Yi then accompanied Zhang Yongsheng to bury mines in Shangxia Jiluo, Wulongchuan, and Nanwang Village west of the Tongpu Road. Within three days, Chiang's troops stepped on a mine in Wulongchuan, killing three and wounding two. The militiamen changed their past tactics of hard hitting and direct assault. On the 29th of last month, after County Commander Xu, Political Commissar, conveyed the policy of combining guerrilla warfare with land reform at a cadre meeting, comrades such as Zhang Yi first challenged the First District, saying, "We will complete the explosion blockade line within two months, and carry out ten flying explosions within one month." Currently, the explosion campaign in the Second District has rapidly unfolded.

　　克服自满杀敌立功
    赵城二区民兵普遍开展爆炸
    【本报太岳二十六日电】赵城二区民兵，由于克服了骄傲自满，在战术上立刻有了显著转变，现已开展爆炸运动。按过去该区民兵轮战队配备有机枪掷弹筒等武器，加上区武委会主任张仪同志的枪百发百中，并曾在明姜等地几次打退阎军，民兵便逐渐骄傲起来，认为埋地雷不如用机枪痛快，埋石雷不如卷步枪威风，所以对上级开展爆炸的指示只是表面应付。自月前在明姜受敌袭击后，思想开始转变，张仪同志亲自研究了上级的爆炸指示。并和受过爆炸训练的郭长娃研究了按雷技术，和安泽轮战民兵在侯村按了石雷，当场试验爆炸威力。民兵张永盛、张化同此时也在树堡旁用石雷炸坏了顽军的一辆汽车，大家相信爆炸可以杀伤敌人，民兵们情绪马上提高。张仪同志便随同张永盛到同蒲路西上下纪落、五龙川、南王村等处埋雷。三日内蒋军即在五龙川将雷踏响，三人炸死，二人受伤。民兵转变了过去硬打硬攻战术。上月二十九日，县指挥部徐政委在干部会议上传达了游击战争与土地改革结合的方针后，张仪等同志首先向一区挑战说：“两月内要捆好爆炸封锁线，一个月中要飞行爆炸十次。”现二区爆炸运动已迅速开展。
