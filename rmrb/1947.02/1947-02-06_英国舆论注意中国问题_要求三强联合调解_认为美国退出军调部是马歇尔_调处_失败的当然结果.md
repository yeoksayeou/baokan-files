Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 4th: Shanghai Dispatch: According to a London dispatch from the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 30th, British public opinion believes that the US withdrawal from "mediating" the Chinese civil war is a natural result of Marshall's failed "mediation." Some opinions suggest a joint mediation by Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. The News Chronicle, a newspaper of the Socialist Party (i.e., the Labour Party), published an article calling for the three powers to jointly determine the steps to be taken on the China issue. The report stated: "This will encourage the Chinese government to adopt more moderate means, making China's future brighter." The report hopes that Foreign Secretary Bevin will take action on this.
