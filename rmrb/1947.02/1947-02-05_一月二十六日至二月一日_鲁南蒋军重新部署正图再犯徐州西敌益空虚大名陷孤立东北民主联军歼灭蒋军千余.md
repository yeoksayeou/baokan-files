　　Weekly Comprehensive Battle Report

　　January 26th to February 1st
    Jiang's Army in Southern Shandong Redeploys, Plots to Re-invade Xuzhou, Western Enemy Increasingly Weakened, Daming Falls into Isolation, Northeast Democratic Allied Army Annihilates Over a Thousand of Jiang's Troops
    This week is the transitional period between two major campaigns. The recovery of Zaozhuang on the 20th of last month ended the Southern Shandong Campaign in January.
    Currently, the new offensive launched by Chiang Kai-shek has its main battlefield still in Southern Shandong, with Chen Cheng, Zhou Zhirou, and others personally commanding the land and air forces in Xuzhou.
    On other battlefields, Chiang Kai-shek launched some local offensives, but they were all defeated. At the same time, in areas where his defensive forces were weak, the Eighth Route Army liberated a number of cities.
    During the past week, the People's Liberation Army on all fronts annihilated more than 17,000 of Chiang's troops and recovered eight cities: Caoxian, Shanxian, Qingfeng, Wenxian, Dingxiang, Lingshi, Xinle, and Dingxian.
    On the main battlefield in Southern Shandong, Chiang's army is concentrating its main forces and deploying for an offensive. To coordinate with the Southern Shandong operation, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the 12th Army, led by Huo Shouyi, to invade Laiwu from the western section of the Jiaoji Railway on the 16th. On the 25th, the Chiang army in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway launched a diversionary offensive in the area west of Jimo. Huo's troops were repelled on the 30th, and over 1,400 enemies west of Ji (mo) were annihilated.
    The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Route Army, from the 22nd to the 26th, successively recovered the four cities of Wenxian, Qingfeng, Caoxian, and Shanxian, annihilating over 5,000 enemies. Zhanggong Town in Ningling, eastern Henan, south of the Longhai Railway, was also liberated by the Eighth Route Army. Chiang's army west of Xuzhou has fully exposed the weakness of its sparse forces, and the enemy in Daming has become even more isolated.
    On the Shanxi battlefield, Yan Xishan used ten divisions (not all) and two columns to invade the liberated areas of Xiaoyi and Fenyang. After annihilating 6,000 of them on the 20th and 21st, the Lvliang Eighth Route Army annihilated over 4,000 more by the 28th. Yan Xishan urgently transferred five regiments from the Tongpu Railway to reinforce, but they were all defeated and are now in full retreat. As a result of Yan Xishan drawing troops to attack Fenxiao, Dingxiang, ninety kilometers northeast of Taiyuan, and Lingshi, one hundred and fifty kilometers south of Taiyuan on the Tongpu Railway, were recovered by the Eighth Route Army on the 29th and 30th respectively.
    A part of Hu Zongnan's army invaded the border of Chishui County in the Guanzhong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia on the 31st and was severely attacked by the Eighth Route Army. Two battalions were annihilated, suffering losses of over 900 men, and we also captured 20 cannons and over 50 machine guns.
    The Eighth Route Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway recovered Xinle on the 26th and liberated Dingxian City on the 28th, annihilating 4,000 enemies. Over two hundred li of the Pinghan Railway between Baoding and Shijiazhuang are now under the control of the Eighth Route Army.
    The Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated over 1,600 enemies in the areas north of Tonghua in Andong Province and west of Changling in Liaobei Province this week. The local offensives of Chiang's army were all thwarted. (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd)

　　一月二十六日至二月一日
    鲁南蒋军重新部署正图再犯徐州西敌益空虚大名陷孤立东北民主联军歼灭蒋军千余
    这一周正是两大战役的过渡时间。上月二十日枣庄之收复，结束了一月鲁南战役。
    目前蒋介石发动的新的攻势，其主要战场仍在鲁南，陈诚、周至柔等都在徐州亲自指挥陆空军作战。
    在其他战场上，蒋介石发动了若干局部性进攻，但都被击败了，同时在其守备兵力单薄的地区，八路军又解放了一批城市。
    上周间，各线人民解放军共歼蒋军一万七千余人，并收复城八座——曹县、单县、清丰、温县、定襄、灵石、新乐、定县。
    鲁南正面战场蒋军，正调集主力部署进攻。为配合鲁南作战，蒋介石曾令其第十二军霍守义部于十六日由胶济路西段南犯莱芜，胶济东段蒋军于二十五日在即墨以西地区又发动牵制性进攻。霍部于三十日已被击退，即（墨）西之敌亦被歼一千四百余人。
    晋冀鲁豫八路军，自二十二至二十六日，连续收复温县、清丰、曹县、单县四城，歼敌五千余人后，而陇海路南豫东宁陵之张弓镇又为八路军解放。徐州以西蒋军，已充分暴露兵力空虚的弱点，大名之敌亦更加陷于孤立。
    在山西战场上，阎锡山以十个师（非全部）及两个纵队兵力，进犯孝义、汾阳解放区。吕梁八路军继二十、二十一两日歼灭其六千人后，迄二十八日止，又歼灭其四千余人。阎锡山曾由同蒲线急调五个团增援，但均被击溃，现已全线败退。正因阎锡山抽兵进攻汾孝的结果，太原东北九十公里之定襄及太原以南一百五十公里同蒲线上之灵石，于二十九及三十日分别为八路军收复。
    胡宗南军一部于三十一日进犯陕甘宁关中分区赤水县边沿，被八路军痛击，两个营就歼，损失九百余人，我并缴获炮二十门，机枪五十余挺。
    平汉北段八路军于二十六日收复新乐，二十八日解放定县城，歼敌四千，保定石家庄间平汉路，已有二百余华里在八路军掌握中。
    东北民主联军，本周内在安东省通化以北及辽北省长岭以西地区，共歼敌一千六百余，蒋军的局部进攻均被阻遏。（新华社延安三日电）
