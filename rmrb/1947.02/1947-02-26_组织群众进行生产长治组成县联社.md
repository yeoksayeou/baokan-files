　　Organizing the Masses for Production: Changzhi Forms County Federation of Cooperatives
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] To lead liberated peasants in production and prosperity, Changzhi has organized a county federation of cooperatives, and liberated peasants are actively buying shares. In Shijiazhuang, District One, 215,000 yuan of shares were purchased. Out of the village's 230 households, 229 people became shareholders. In Nanbeijuncheng and two other villages in District Three, 374,000 yuan of shares were purchased in three days. Throughout the county, a total of 5,115,250 yuan of shares were purchased. The federation was officially established on January 29th, and the production guidelines for this year were set: 1. Organize large-scale textile production. With 190,000 people in the county, in order to address the change of seasons in the spring, each person needs two jin of cotton, requiring a total of 380,000 jin of cotton for textiles. A textile tool factory has already been established, purchasing 18 cotton carding bows and 5,520 jin of cotton. 2. Organize transportation, transporting hemp and iron produced locally in exchange for cotton, and increasing livestock to alleviate the shortage of animal power. 3. Promote cotton planting to fundamentally solve the shortage of cotton raw materials. 4. Address the shortage of agricultural implements, organizing blacksmiths and carpenters in each village to manufacture tools. An agricultural implement factory has already been established. 5. Support the development of the iron industry, organizing ironworkers to carry out production, and organizing Changzhi's organs and shops to provide assistance. (Changzhi United Office)
