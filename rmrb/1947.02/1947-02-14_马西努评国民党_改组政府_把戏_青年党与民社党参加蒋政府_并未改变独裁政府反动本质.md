Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 11th: Moscow Radio on the 10th broadcast: Commentator Masinu on current affairs in China. On February 6th, Chinese newspapers reported that the Kuomintang government had reached an agreement with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the reorganization of the government. The Kuomintang newspapers therefore widely publicized that "the work of reorganizing the government is about to be completed." However, Chinese democrats have a different assessment of this issue. They believe that absorbing one or two leaders from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party into the Kuomintang government will not change the nature of this government at all, because these two small parties do not represent the interests of democrats; in fact, they are no different from the reactionaries who absorbed them into the Kuomintang government. According to the booklet "Current Situation of Various Small Parties in China" distributed by the Kuomintang secret service agency "Central Statistics Bureau," the Youth Party initially supported Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang, supported the Northern Warlords during the Great Revolution, and colluded with the enemy and puppets during the Anti-Japanese War. Zeng Qi was the liaison between Chongqing and Nanjing. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Youth Party is one of the Kuomintang reactionaries, although they did not directly join the Kuomintang. The Youth Party participated in the so-called "National Assembly" convened by the Kuomintang, and is now participating in the so-called "reorganizing the government" farce. As for the Democratic Socialist Party, Chinese democrats pointed out that it has nothing to do with democracy or socialism, and they are seeking compromise with the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are both running dogs of the Kuomintang reactionaries in realizing their so-called "reorganizing the government," but this kind of reorganization does not conform to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the government should be reorganized on a democratic basis and representatives of genuine democratic parties should be absorbed into the government, but this kind of genuine democratic reorganization is not suitable for the plans of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the plans of foreign reactionaries who aid the Kuomintang. The reactionaries' attempt is to create a "legal" form to cover up the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship and foreign interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, Chinese democrats pointed out that American reactionary leader Vandenberg's speech in Cleveland on January 11th, which preemptively announced the Kuomintang's reorganization of the government by non-communist parties, was faithfully followed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, because it suited their wishes.

    马西努评国民党“改组政府”把戏
    青年党与民社党参加蒋政府
    并未改变独裁政府反动本质
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科十日广播：评论员马西努论中国时事。二月六日中国报纸消息，国民党政府关于改组政府，已与民社党及青年党达到协议，国民党报纸因此大事传布“改组政府的工作快完成了”。可是，中国民主人士对这一问题却另有估计，他们认为吸收民社党与青年党一两个领袖参加国民党政府，丝毫不能改变这个政府的本质，因为这两个小党派不是民主派利益的代表；实际上，他们与吸收他们参加国民党政府的反动派没有丝毫区别。据国民党特务机关“中统局”散发的“中国各小党派现状”小册子记载，青年党在最初捧吴佩孚、孙传芳，大革命时拥护北洋军阀，抗战时期与敌伪勾结，曾琦即是担任重庆与南京的联络人。中国民主人士指出，青年党是国民党反动派之一，虽然他们没有直接加入国民党。青年党参加国民党召集的所谓“国大”，现在又参加玩弄所谓“改组政府”的把戏。至于民社党，据中国民主人士指出，它与民主主义或社会主义毫无关系，他们正图与国民党反动派寻求妥协。中国民主人士指出，青年党与民社党都是国民党反动派实现其所谓“改组政府”手段的走狗，可是这种改组绝不符合于政协决议。按政协决议要在民主基础上改组政府，吸收真正的民主党派代表参加政府，可是这种真正的民主改组是不适合于国民党反动派的计划与援助国民党的外国反动派的计划的。反动派的企图是想造成“合法”的形式，掩盖国民党的一党独裁政治及外人对中国内政的干涉。因此中国民主派人士指出，美国反动派首领范登堡一月十一日在克利夫兰的演讲，预先宣布国民党由非共产党的党派改组政府，这个演说获得国民党反动派的忠实遵行，因为他适合他们的心意。
