A short commentary:

Thoroughly Expose and Struggle Against Hidden Landlords

The cunning of landlords has been demonstrated by many facts. If land reform has progressed to a certain stage, and people see that the landlords have been defeated on the surface, they become complacent and think it's "good enough," failing to continue mobilizing the masses to pursue and thoroughly expose them. This will leave loose ends, and the peasants will not be able to truly liberate themselves. In Lv Village, Lin County, after several years of struggling for liberation, this time, the mobilization continued to pursue and attack the landlords and local tyrants, and 300 mu of land hidden by the landlords was unearthed. This shows how important it is to launch a continued pursuit.

As the experience of Lucheng shows: one of the most ingenious ways for landlords to resist the peasants' struggle is to kill two birds with one stone by depositing things in the homes of peasants. On the one hand, they preserve their own belongings; on the other hand, the peasants carry a mental burden. This gives us an important revelation: if we cannot truly defeat the landlords economically, we cannot truly defeat them politically. There are still many facts about landlords hiding land and property in various places, some of which have been exposed, and some of which have not yet attracted enough attention from the masses. It is hoped that leaders in various places will pay attention to this fact, guide the masses to continue the pursuit, and continue to review, so that no feudal vestiges are left in any village!

　　把隐蔽地主斗透
    地主的狡猾性，已有许多事实证明了。如果土地改革进行到一定阶段，看到地主在表面上被打垮了，就产生“自满、差不多”，不继续发动群众性的追击，追透斗透，那便会留下尾巴，农民仍然翻不透身。林县吕庄村，闹了几年翻身，这次发动继续向地主恶霸追击，地主隐蔽的三百亩土地挖掘出来；可以看出，发起继续追击是何等的重要。
    确如潞城的经验：地主抵抗农民斗争，最巧妙的办法之一，是一箭双雕，在农民家里寄放东西，一方面保存了自己东西，另一方面农民思想上背了包袱，这给我们一个重要启示：如果不能把地主在经济上真正打垮，政治上也不能做到真正打得垮。各地地主隐蔽土地财产的事实还不少，有些是被揭发了，有些还未引起群众足够的注意。希望各地领导上注意这一事实，引导群众继续追击，继续复查，要使每一个村不留一个封建尾巴！
