    To the Editor:
    After reading "Position Reconnaissance" and "The Battle of Yangzhuang" in your newspaper on January 27th, I was filled with endless thoughts. When I read the part in "The Battle of Yangzhuang" where the deputy regimental commander said, "We must fight even if there is only one person left," I was reminded of his decisive, firm, and courageous command spirit, and how Company Commander Wu fought bravely and tenaciously alone, which made my blood boil. I extend my highest respect and gratitude to the deputy regimental commander, Battalion Commander Teng, Company Commander Wu, and all the commanders and fighters. I read it four times in a row, and at night I thought about the situation of "The Battle of Yangzhuang" on the kang, and I couldn't fall asleep. I thought to myself: I am working in the rear, and my life is not tense enough, and I am a little scattered. Especially, I have done too little work. If I continue like this, from the perspective of revolutionary conscience, how can I be worthy of the soldiers fighting on the front line today? From now on, I will work, produce, and study with a fighting spirit and tension, and do a good job in supporting the front line. Only in this way can we further increase the bravery of the soldiers on the front line, achieve greater victories, and accelerate the victory of independent, peaceful, and democratic ideals.
    Therefore, I suggest: (1) All departments in the rear should implement the spirit of "Position Reconnaissance" and "The Battle of Yangzhuang" into work, production, study, and military training, so that everyone can form a huge force with such a tense, courageous, and decisive fighting spirit to complete and exceed tasks, in order to support the victory of the front-line self-defense liberation war.
    (2) It is suggested that front-line reporters write more articles like "Position Reconnaissance" and "The Battle of Yangzhuang." It is suggested that playwrights and musicians write these stories into one-act plays or make them into songs to educate rear workers and the people, so that their thoughts are closely linked with the fighting spirit of the soldiers on the front line, and they can work, produce, study, practice martial arts, prepare for war, and eliminate the enemy with tension.
    Editor: I don't know if my idea is right, please publish it to tell everyone. Wishing you all the best!

    读了“杨庄之战”等通讯  我有两点建议编辑同志：
    读贵报一月廿七日的“阵地侦察”及“杨庄之战”后，使我心中有无限感想。读到“杨庄之战”中的副团长说：“剩下一个人也要干，”的地方，使我想到他的果断、坚定、勇敢的指挥精神，和吴连长如何在单独顽强的勇敢战斗着，使我的血液沸腾起来了，对副团长、滕营长、吴连长及全体指战员，致以崇高的敬仰和感谢之忱，我接连读了四次，夜里在炕上又想“杨庄之战”的情境，不知为什么又睡不着。内心想：我是在后方工作，生活不够紧张，有些散漫。尤其是工作作得太少了，我再要像这样下去，从革命的良心来讲，怎样对得起今天在前线的将士呢？自现在起，我要以战斗精神，紧张工作、生产、学习，把我们支援前线的工作做好，只有那样才能更增加前方将士的勇敢，胜利更大，独立和平民主就会加速的胜利。
    为此，我建议：（一）后方各部门应把“阵地侦察”、“杨庄之战”的精神，贯彻到工作、生产、学习、练武中去，使每个人以那样紧张、勇敢、坚决的战斗精神，形成一种巨大力量，完成任务，并且超过，以支援前线自卫解放战争胜利。
    （二）建议前线记者多多写“阵地侦察”、“杨庄之战”一类的文章，建议戏剧作家及音乐工作者，把这类故事写成独幕剧或制成歌曲，教育后方工作者和人民，使在思想上同前方将士作战精神，确切的联系起来，紧张的工作、生产、学习、练武和备战、消灭敌人。
    编辑同志：我这个意思不知对不对，请登报告诉大家。敬祝编安！
