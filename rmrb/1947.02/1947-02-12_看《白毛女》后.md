    After Seeing "The White-Haired Girl"
    Liu Xiuzhen
    In the past, I was a person who didn't step out of the main gate or the inner gate, didn't look askance, and obeyed the "three obediences and four virtues." I had never been abused or humiliated by anyone, and always thought that as long as I treated people well, they would definitely not treat me badly.

    The first time I saw "The White-Haired Girl," I was very sad, thinking that it might be an isolated incident and would never be a common occurrence. But this event often revolved in my mind, constantly making me think: Can people be so cruel to each other? The second time I saw "The White-Haired Girl," seeing the experiences of Yang Bailao and Xi'er, I almost burst into tears. I gave Yang Bailao and Xi'er infinite sympathy. I hate landlords, I hate exploiters, I hate bullies who oppress the poor. I understand that this event is by no means accidental, but is caused by the feudal system. I further experienced how profound the ancient saying "The rich are unbenevolent" is! Indeed, it speaks to the essence of the exploiters. I think the poor should stand up, should completely eliminate the cannibalistic feudal system!

    The tragic life of the White-Haired Girl in the cave, if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army's resistance against Japan, and the Communist Party's help in establishing a democratic government for the people, implementing rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and breaking superstitions, then the poor Xi'er would have died miserably in the cave, full of grievances, never to be redressed!

    When the democratic government mobilized the masses to reduce rent and interest, the landlord Huang Shiren even used the ghost story of the White-Haired Immortal to threaten the masses. He never expected that the White-Haired Immortal was Xi'er, whom he had abused, raped, and murdered, causing her to run away. However, the peasants he exploited and suppressed actually believed it to be true, thinking that even the White-Haired Immortal did not approve of rent reduction and interest reduction, so how dare the common people even dream of it? Wealth and poverty are predestined, don't daydream! Seeing this, I finally understood that the so-called Bodhisattvas and Living Buddhas, listening to fate, are all tools used by the rulers to suppress the people. Xi'er suffered for many years in the cave. Why didn't a Bodhisattva or Living Buddha show compassion and save the poor Xi'er? It wasn't until the Eighth Route Army came that she was rescued. It can be seen that the real Bodhisattvas and Living Buddhas who save people from suffering are not in heaven, but on earth; it is not some religion that eats vegetarian food and chants scriptures, but the Communist Party that seeks the interests of the people; it is not Jesus, Sakyamuni, or Jigong the Living Buddha, but the great revolutionary teacher—Mao Zedong!

    看《白毛女》后
    刘秀珍
    我过去是一个大门不出二门不迈，目不邪视，遵守“三从四德”的人，从来没有受过人的虐待和侮辱，总以为只要自己待人好，人待自己就一定不会坏的。
    第一次看《白毛女》我很难过，以为那或者是一件偶然的事，决不会是普遍的事情；但这一件事情经常围绕在我的脑海里，使我不断地思索：人对人会那样残忍么？第二次我又看《白毛女》，看到杨白劳和喜儿的遭遇，我几乎放声大哭，我对杨白劳和喜儿给以无限的同情。我恨地主，恨剥削者，恨欺压穷人的恶霸，我了解这件事情决不是偶然的，而是封建社会的制度所造成的。我更体验出“为富不仁”的一句古训，说的如何深刻！的确说穿了剥削者的本质。我认为穷人应该翻身，应该把吃人的封建制度铲除尽净！
    白毛女在山洞里悲惨的生活，如果没有八路军抗战，没有共产党帮助人民树立民主政权，实行减租减息，破除迷信，那末，可怜的喜儿，就会苦死在山洞里，满腹冤仇，永无昭雪之日！
    在民主政府发动群众减租减息的时候，地主黄世仁还假白毛仙姑给他托梦的鬼话威胁群众，他万没想到白毛仙姑正是他虐待、奸污、谋杀因而逃跑的喜儿；然被他剥削镇压的农民们却都信以为真，以为白毛仙姑都不赞成减租减息，老百姓还敢妄想么？贫富自有命定，不要胡思乱想吧！看到这里，我才明白了，原来所谓菩萨活佛，听天由命，都是统治者借以镇压人民的工具。喜儿在山洞里受了多年灾难，为什么没有一个菩萨或活佛大发慈悲拯救可怜的喜儿呢？一直等到八路军来后，才把她营救出来。可见真正救苦救难的菩萨活佛并不在天堂，而是在人间；不是吃斋念佛的什么教，而是为人民谋利益的共产党；不是耶稣、释迦牢尼、济公活佛，而是伟大的革命导师——毛泽东！
