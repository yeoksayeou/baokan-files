    Small Method

    Sweet Buckwheat Straw for Lye-Making
    Burn sweet buckwheat straw (bitter buckwheat straw won't work) into ash, put it in a basin, and stir with boiling water. For every pound of ash, add one pound of water. After about ten minutes, filter the clear water into a clean pot and cook over low heat until it turns red. When it is almost dry, take it out and put it in the sun to dry or on a warm kang (heated brick bed) for a day, and it becomes red lye, which can be used for steaming buns or washing clothes.

    甜荞麦秸熬碱
    把甜荞麦秸（苦荞麦秸不行）烧成灰，放在盆里，用开水冲搅，每一斤灰放一斤水，约在十分钟后，把澄清的水，滤到净锅里，烧上小火煮，即变成红色。到快熬干时，取出来，放在太阳底下晒或放在暖炕头上过一天时间，就成了红碱，蒸馍或洗衣服都能用。
