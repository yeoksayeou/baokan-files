Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th -- The New Fourth Army in the rear of the Jiang-occupied area of Suzhong wiped out more than 400 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops in one fell swoop. Since last autumn, after repeated failures of Chiang Kai-shek's army's "encirclement and suppression" in Suzhong, Wang Maogong, the Chiang-appointed chairman of Jiangsu Province, personally went to Dongtai to "supervise the suppression." On January 31st, he commanded the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army stationed in Dongtai (note that this brigade was already encircled and annihilated by the New Fourth Army at Jiali City on the Ru(gao)-Huang(qiao) line at the end of August last year, and the brigade commander and deputy brigade commander were captured; only recently were conscripts from Guangdong used to fill the original designation) and its subordinate units, along with security teams, etc., to invade and occupy Shenzao (40 li northeast of Dongtai) and reoccupy Xituan (60 li northeast of Dongtai), attempting to rebuild "encirclement and suppression" bases. Only one hour after the Chiang Kai-shek troops entered Shenzao, a unit of the New Fourth Army surrounded them. After fierce fighting until the afternoon of the 1st, they wiped out parts of the first battalion of the 599th Regiment and the first battalion of the 560th Regiment of the brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army, as well as the entire Third Column of the Dongtai Security Regiment, totaling more than 400 people. Only a few Chiang Kai-shek troops escaped under the cover of two fighter planes. The New Fourth Army captured three artillery pieces, 15 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 200 rifles. Shenzao returned to the hands of the people. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek troops who reoccupied Xituan also withdrew in panic.

    苏中再次粉碎蒋军“清剿”
    新四军歼敌四百
    【新华社华中四日电】苏中蒋占区后方新四军一举歼灭出犯蒋军四百余名。自去秋以来，蒋军对苏中“清剿”连遭失败后，蒋记江苏省主席王懋功乃亲至东台“督剿”，于一月三十一日指挥侵踞东台之蒋军六十五师一八七旅（按该旅早于去年八月底被新四军围歼于如（皋）黄（桥）线上之加力市，正副旅长均被俘，直至最近始以抓自广东之壮丁顶用原番号）所部配合保安队等侵陷沈灶（东台东北四十里）重占西团（东台东北六十里），企图再建“清剿”基地。当蒋军进入沈灶仅一小时，新四军某部将其包围，激战至一日下午，歼灭该旅蒋军五九九团一营、五六○团一营各一部，及东台保安团第三纵队全部共四百余人，仅少数蒋军在战斗机两架掩护下逃脱。新四军缴获炮三门，轻重机枪十五挺，步枪二百余支，沈灶重入人民之手。与此同时，重占西团蒋军亦仓惶撤走。
