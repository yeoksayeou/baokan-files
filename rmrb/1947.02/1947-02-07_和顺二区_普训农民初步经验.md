    Heshun Second District
    Preliminary Experience of Universal Training for Peasants
    According to a report from the Taihang Branch: The first phase of concentrated training for liberated peasants in the Second District of Heshun has concluded. The process and preliminary experiences are introduced as follows: The overall plan was to first have the district directly train one-fourth of the district's peasants (approximately 2,500 people in two batches) in concentrated sessions. This group would then serve as the main force to educate all peasants at the village level. All twenty villages in the district were divided into four base points, led personally by district cadres, and carried out simultaneously. The first phase lasted five days, with a total of 1,020 peasants receiving training (40 to 70 people per village). The method of concentrated training was to hold meetings and discussions to stimulate self-awareness. First, the leadership would raise several questions, which would then be discussed in small groups. After a typical example was identified, a typical speech would be given at a general meeting to inspire everyone. Then, the leadership would promptly draw a brief conclusion and guide the discussion of the following issues until all issues were discussed. Finally, the leadership would make a systematic summary.

    The concentrated training resolved the following ideological problems: 1. Starting from finding the root of poverty and reviewing history (general complaint), it resolved the question of who is the master of the land. Peasant Li Ruyi cried bitterly at the general meeting, saying: "In the past, I rented a piece of wasteland from landlord Guo Kuiwen. After several years of hard work, I cultivated it so it could grow crops. He then took it away. I sold a load of eggs for six yuan and asked my brother to steam twenty large steamed buns, which we delivered to them together, begging him to rent the land back to me. He wouldn't even let us in the door. My brother died of anger because of this matter, and my whole family became poor because of it." Liu Heshang said: "I rented a barren slope from landlord Li Zhanyuan, paying three shi of rent per year. It never grew crops. I spent a great deal of effort to make it look like land. Li Zhanyuan took it all back and rented it to someone else. Did he ever cultivate it himself!" As he spoke, he stood up and angrily said to everyone: "Whose land is it really?" Everyone said in unison: "Whoever reclaims it, the land belongs to them." Another peasant said: "I understand that the slope originally belonged to no one in the village. Li Zhanyuan's grandfather was an intellectual and privately wrote a red contract, and that's how it became his." After typical speeches, a backward peasant who originally thought, "When heaven and earth were created, the three emperors arranged the land. Those who were assigned more became landlords, and those who weren't assigned any should work for others," said after the meeting: "It turns out the land belonged to no one. The rich people's land was all seized by force." When the masses had this realization, the leadership promptly made a brief conclusion: "The land is cultivated by the peasants, and the peasants are the masters of the land. Landlords live by exploiting the peasants. Their land is all seized from the peasants. They are false masters. The old society was unfair." 2. Peasants were slaves in the old society and masters in the new society. Peasants should control political power and armed forces to protect themselves. After the peasants understood that "the land belongs to the laborers," the leadership guided them in this way: "Since the land belongs to the peasants, and it was wrong for landlords to oppress peasants in the old society, why didn't the peasants resist earlier? Why did they wait until today to turn over?" Old hired laborer Zhao Xiaoma said: "The political power in the old society belonged to the landlords. People often say: 'The yamen faces south, but it's hard to get justice without money.' Peasant Liu Guai sold six mu of his eight mu of land to the Jiao family landlord, keeping two mu for himself. The Jiao family insisted on taking two more mu. The lawsuit went all the way to Taiyuan, but the court still ruled that those two mu belonged to the Jiao family." A peasant from Keju Village said: "In the past, a woman in our village took two ears of corn from her own field. The landlord insisted that she stole them, immediately detained her in the village office. The woman died of anger on the landlord's doorstep after being tortured. Her husband went to reason with the landlord and was also beaten to death. Two lives were lost because of two ears of corn. Where was the justice? Today, we can turn over because the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government have stood up for us." The leadership immediately concluded: After we turned over, we should rely on the Communist Party, seize political power, strengthen the militia, and protect our interests. 3. Believe in ourselves and unity, don't believe in gods and ghosts. Regarding this issue, the peasants said: "When I was a full-time worker for the landlord, he often used the Great Immortal to scare me: 'If you make trouble, the Great Immortal will punish you.' I was really scared. Once, the landlord asked me to burn incense to the Great Immortal. On the way, I secretly ate the wine and meat offerings. Nothing bad happened that year. I realized that gods are paper tigers used by landlords to scare people." Inspired by him, everyone competed to speak, citing many facts from their experiences of turning over to prove that gods and ghosts are fake. The leading comrade pointed out succinctly: "Gods and ghosts are clever methods used by landlords to rule peasants. Our turning over proves that gods and ghosts cannot protect landlords. We rely on the power of unity to defeat the landlords." 4. As long as we are closely united, the sky will never change. The leadership first guided: "Today we have become the masters of the new society, so why are some people afraid to take the fruits?" Peasant Yan Qiansuo said: "I am afraid of 'the sky changing' and dare not settle accounts with the landlord." Du Rulan said: "The sky cannot change. The Eighth Route Army already has more than a million troops today. We are not even afraid of the Japanese devils, so why should we be afraid of Chiang Kai-shek? Our people dig up the roots of trees (landlords) in the rear, and the Eighth Route Army cuts down the tree trunks on the front line. As long as we are united, we will definitely defeat the reactionaries!" This issue was debated most heatedly. Finally, in addition to making a comparison of strength, the leadership particularly emphasized: "Our strength is the unity of the broad masses of the people, and we also have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. The reactionaries are a minority, and they are bound to fail." 5. Uproot poverty and establish wealth, organize to engage in production. The leading comrades first guided: "We have turned over economically, politically, and ideologically, does that mean we have become rich?" After deliberation, everyone unanimously concluded: "Turning over is liberation, getting rich depends on production, and production requires organization." However, some people still had the "cutting leeks" mentality, which was resolved after discussing the direction of Wu Manyou.

    Through separate discussions and general meeting summaries, most peasants had a relatively complete ideological awareness and broke many ideological concerns. For example, the honest peasant Du Liuai had never spoken at village meetings and was embarrassed to take the fruits he was given. This time, he also spoke: "When I got the fruits at home, I felt uneasy, but now I know I am taking back what is mine." Yan Lahu said: "In the past, I was afraid of 'the sky changing' and dared not take the fruits, but now I understand that the sky will never change."

    和顺二区
    普训农民初步经验
    据太行分社报导：和顺二区第一期集训翻身农民已告结束，其经过情形及初步经验介绍如下：整个计划确定先由区直接集训全区农民的四分之一（约二千五百人分两次），以这批人为主力，再以村为单位，教育全部农民。全区二十个村，分四个基点，由区干部亲自领导，同时进行。第一期时间五天，受训农民共一千零二十人（每村四十至七十人）；集训方式是开会座谈，启发自觉。首先由领导上提出几个问题，依次经小组酝酿，成熟发现典型后，即开大会作典型发言，启发大家，然后经领导上及时作出简要的结论，并引导进行以下问题的讨论，使全部问题讨论完毕，再由领导上作出系统的总结。
    集训中解决了以下几个思想问题：一、从找穷根，回顾历史（总诉苦）入手，解决了到底谁是土地的主人翁的问题。农民李如义在大会上痛哭流涕的说：“过去俺租种地主郭魁文一块荒地，费了好几年工夫，修理的能长田禾啦，他便夺去了，我拿一担鸡蛋卖了六块钱，叫俺弟弟蒸了二十个大馍馍，一齐送给他们，求告他还把地租给俺，他连大门都不让进，弟弟为此事气死，俺全家就穷在这上头”。刘和尚说：“俺租地主李占元一道荒坡，每年出租三石，从没长过田禾，俺费了九牛二虎之力才收拾的像个地样，李占元便全部收回，另租给别人了，你问他开过一荒没有！”说着他就站起来，怒气冲冲向大家说：“到底这地是谁的？”大家异口同声的说：“谁开出来，地就是谁的”。另一个农民说：“俺了解，那荒坡本村就没主，李占元的祖父是知识分子，私写了一张红契就成了他的”。经过典型发言，一个落后农民原来认为：“开天辟地，三皇治世时，就把土地按排好啦，安的多的就成了地主，没安上的就该给人家动弹”，会后，他也说：“原来地就没主，老财们的地都是生法霸占的”。当群众有此觉悟时，领导上便及时的作了简要结论：“土地是农民开出来的，农民是土地的主人，地主是靠剥削农民过活的，他们的土地都是霸占农民的，他们是假主人，旧社会就是不公道”。二、农民在旧社会是奴隶，在新社会是主人，农民应当掌握政权与武装、保卫自己。农民了解了“土地是属于劳动者”之后，领导上便这样的诱导：土地既是农民的，旧社会地主压迫农民既然不对，农民为什么不早反抗，要等到今天才闹翻身呢？”老雇农赵小马说：“旧社会的政权是地主的，人常说：‘天下衙门朝南开，有理无钱难进来’。农民刘拐有八亩地卖给焦家地主六亩，剩下二亩自己种，焦家就硬要多带二亩，官司打到太原，结果还是把那二亩地判成焦家了”。科举村一个农民说：“俺村过去有一个妇女，从自己地里拿回二穗玉茭，地主硬说是偷他的，马上把他扣在村公所，那女人受活罪后，便气死在地主门上，她的丈夫去讲理，也被地主打死，因为自己的二穗玉茭却送了两条人命，那里有理，今天咱们能翻身，是共产党、八路军、民主政府，给作了主”。领导上马上便总结说：我们翻了身，就应当依靠共产党，掌握政权，壮大民兵，保卫我们的利益。三、信自己团结，不信鬼神。对于这个问题农民们和说：给地主当常工时，他常拿大仙爷吓唬我：“你要捣蛋，大仙爷就要处罚你”。我确实害怕，有一次地主叫我去给大仙爷烧香，在半路上把上供的酒肉偷偷吃了，那年什么灾难也没有，我才知道神是地主们用来吓唬人的纸老虎”。经他启发，大家争着发言，举出许多翻身经过的事实，证明神鬼是假的。领导同志即扼要指出：“鬼神是地主统治农民的巧办法，我们闹翻身就证明了神鬼并不能保佑地主，我们是靠团结的力量打垮地主的。”四、只要我们团结紧，天永远不会变。领导上首先诱导：今天我们成了新社会的主人啦，为什还有人不敢要果实？农民阎千锁说：“我就是怕‘变天’，不敢跟地主算账”。杜如兰说：“天变不了，八路军今天已有了一百多万大军，日本鬼子咱都不怕，还怕个蒋介石？咱们老百姓在后方刨树根（地主），八路军在前线砍树身只要团结好，定能战胜反动派”！这个问题争论最热烈，最后领导上除作了力量对比的说明外，特别强调指出：“我们的力量是广大人民的团结，又有毛主席的正确领导，反动派是少数人，他们一定要失败”。五、拔了穷根安富根，组织起来闹生产。领导同志首先诱导：“咱们经济上、政治上、思想上都翻了身，是不是就等于发了财”？经过酝酿，大家一致的结论是：“翻身是解放，发家靠生产，生产要组织”。但是有些人还有“割韭菜”思想，经讨论吴满有方向后遂亦解决。
    经过分别讨论与大会总结，多数农民有了比较完整的思想自觉，打破许多思想顾虑，如老实农民杜六孩，在村里开会从未发过言，分给他果实，他不好意思要，这次也发了言：“我在家时，得了果实，觉得良心下不来，现在才知道是拿回自己的东西”。阎拉虎说：“以前我怕‘变天’，不敢要果实，现在心里清楚啦，天决不怕变”。
