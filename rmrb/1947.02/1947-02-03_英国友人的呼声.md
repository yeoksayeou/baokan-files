　　On New Year's Day this year, Ta Kung Pao published a New Year's letter from 27 British Labour Party MPs to the Chinese people, saying, "We are constantly thinking of you, and we believe that the future destiny of the world will be decided in the Far East, and China will play an important role in this decision." On January 22, the British House of Lords debated British policy towards China. Labour MP Lord Lindsay criticized the autocratic corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek government, saying that if it were compared with the Franco government, "then the Spanish government would be considered a liberal democracy," and therefore "one cannot expect Chiang Kai-shek to accept democratic ideas." He praised the achievements of the CCP, saying, "The CCP is against a one-party dictatorship government, and it has created an unprecedented new situation in North China, where farmers can preserve their land and harvests and overcome the suffering that the people of North China have historically suffered." He suggested that the British government should freely consult with the United States and the Soviet Union on the China issue to prevent China's civil war, and suggested sending representatives to Yan'an to establish direct contact with the CCP. The Labour government's Lord Chancellor Jowitt, in his reply on behalf of the government, specifically mentioned the announcement of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, saying, "According to this unanimous policy, Britain does not want to see China subjected to the totalitarian rule imposed by any group or party, and the British government welcomes the implementation of the Moscow Declaration on the broad participation of democratic elements in the National Government." He also said that the British government "firmly adheres to the decision not to interfere in China's internal affairs."
　　The above remarks by British figures are the calls of China's friends, and they partially reflect the just opinions and concern of the British people for the Chinese situation, which is worthy of welcome from the Chinese people. At a time when the U.S. "mediation" in China has officially declared failure, and the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is about to be held, these opinions from the British government and the public have even greater practical significance. It is only a pity that there are still many greedy cowards among the main power holders in Britain today. Due to their political myopia, they often only calculate small gains and suffer big losses. They should really "deeply study this issue" as Lord Lindsay said.
　　Since World War II, China and Britain should have been good friends who shared weal and woe. During the war, they were comrades-in-arms fighting side by side; after the war, they were fellow sufferers suffering from the oppression of American imperialism. As wartime comrades-in-arms and post-war fellow sufferers, standing on the same front, mutually "constantly thinking, sincerely hoping to end the pain" and achieve happy results, this is a logical thing. Unfortunately, Britain produced a Churchill, who insisted on relying on the United States as a good strategy, like a chick burrowing under the belly of a hen, chattering and issuing his arguments of selling out his own country and committing suicide. Attlee's government also actually went a long way with him. The British people saw through this reactionary traitorous policy and have already demonstrated their firm will and strength by ousting Churchill and opposing the foreign policy of the Attlee government. In China, there emerged a Chiang Kai-shek, who is truly worse than Franco, desperately pursuing dictatorship and civil war, and selling out the country and the people to American imperialism. The Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country saw through this scum and refused to agree to him doing so, and therefore rose up to oppose the "one-party dictatorship government" and demanded the establishment of a democratic coalition government to build a "unified, democratic China agreed upon by the three foreign ministers." Thus, it is very clear that the struggles of the Chinese and British people today have a common goal, which is to oppose the aggression and oppression of U.S. imperialism. In order to achieve this goal, the two peoples, in their opposition to the traitorous Churchill policy and the Chiang Kai-shek policy, should encourage and support each other, which is only natural. The Chinese and British people should have already joined hands closely in a common struggle under one goal, and this common front of the Chinese and British people will be an important force in resisting the American expansionist policy.
　　In order to develop the interests of both countries, the Chinese people fully understand the importance of British business to China. Britain is now in urgent need of foreign trade, of which trade with China occupies a very important position. For their own economic interests, the Chinese people are also in urgent need of establishing normal business relations with friendly countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has become a major obstacle to this development. He sold China's entire sovereignty to U.S. imperialism with the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." The Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen four comprador families have used American capital and commodities to monopolize the Chinese market, and in order to please their master, U.S. imperialism, they do not hesitate to use various means to undermine the friendly relations between the Chinese and British people. From this, it can be seen that British Lord Chancellor Jowitt, in this debate in the House of Lords, on the one hand, pointed out that Sino-British trade must be restored, and on the other hand, emphasized that "Britain does not want to see China subjected to the totalitarian rule imposed by any group or party," and is willing to "work and associate with a strong, consolidated government that can faithfully fulfill its obligations and is based on a broad democratic foundation," which is by no means without basis. For more than a year, what the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people have been striving for is to oppose the centralized rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and establish a strong and consolidated democratic coalition government with a broad democratic foundation. Only when such a government emerges can it guarantee a truly peaceful and democratic life in China, and only then can it establish truly friendly relations with various friendly countries in political, economic, and cultural aspects on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
　　China is enduring difficulties, and the Chinese people cannot help but express their gratitude for the concern of friendly people. We naturally also welcome the suggestion that the Allied powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should strictly fulfill the obligations stipulated by the Three Foreign Ministers Conference and assist China in moving towards independence, peace, and democracy. However, we want to solemnly point out that China is a great country with a long history, and the Chinese people have sufficient estimation of their own wisdom and will. Their greatest wish is to abide by the "policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs" of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and to let the Chinese people handle their own affairs. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to clear their own obstacles and solve their own problems along the track of democratic progress in the world, so that they and all friendly countries can "achieve happy results" on an equal footing. It can be asserted that the Chinese people will never disappoint the British people and democratic people all over the world.

### 英国友人的呼声

专栏：解放日报社论

　　英国友人的呼声
    今年元旦，大公报发表了一封廿七位英国工党议员给中国人民的贺年信，内中说：“我们在不断的想念着你们，我们相信世界将来的命运决定于远东，而在这决定中，中国会扮演一个重要的角色。”一月二十二日英国上议院辩论英国对华政策，工党议员林赛爵士斥责蒋介石政府的专制腐败说：如果拿它与佛朗哥政府相比，“那么西班牙政府还算是自由主义的民主政治”，因此“不能希望蒋介石会接受民主思想”。他赞扬中共的政绩说：“中共是在反对一党专政的政府，所在华北已造成有史以来未有的新情况，农民得以保存他们的土地和收成，并能克服华北人民历来所受的苦难。”他建议英政府应与美苏两国对中国问题自由协商，防制中国的内战，并且建议派遣代表到延安，与中共建立直接联系。工党政府司法大臣佐威特在代表政府作答时，特别提起莫斯科三外长会议的公告，他说：“根据此项一致的政策，英国不愿看到中国受任何一个集团或政党所强行的极权统治，英国政府欢迎实践莫斯科宣言关于民主分子广泛参加国民政府的决定。”又说：英国政府“坚决遵守不干涉中国内政的决定。”
    上述英国人士的言论，是中国的友人的呼声，它们部分反映了英国人民对中国局势的公正意见与关怀，这是值得中国人民欢迎的。正当美国对华“调处”已经正式宣告失败，而莫斯科四强外长会议又将举行的今天，英国朝野的这些意见更有其重大的现实意义。只可惜英国今天主要的当权者还不少贪婪的懦夫。他们由于自己的政治近视，经常只能算小账蚀大本。他们当真应该像林赛爵士所说的“深长的研究这个问题”。
    从二次大战以来，中英两国本该是患难与共的好朋友，在战时，它们是并肩作战的战友；在战后则是同受美国帝国主义压迫的难友。战时的战友与战后的难友，大家站在同一条阵线上，相互“不断地想念、诚恳地希望结束痛苦”、获致幸福的结果，这本是合乎逻辑的事情。无奈英国出了个邱吉尔，他偏偏以依附美国为得计，像小鸡钻在老母鸡肚子底下一样，呱啦呱啦大发其出卖自己国家和自杀一议论，而工党的贝文也居然跟他走了一大程；英国人民看穿了这个反动卖国政策，已经以赶走邱吉尔反对贝文外交表现出自己的坚强意志与力量。在中国则出了个蒋介石，他真是比佛朗哥还要坏，拚命地独裁内战，把国家与人民出卖给美国帝国主义；中国共产党和全国人民看破了这货色，不答应他这样办，因而起来反对“一党专政的政府”，要求建立民主联合政府，建设“三国外长一致同意的统一的民主中国”。如此，就很明白中英两国人民今天的奋斗有着一个共同目标，那就是反对美帝国主义的侵略与压迫。为要达到这个目标，两国人民在其反对卖国的邱吉尔政策与蒋介石政策中，作相互的鼓动与声援，那是理所当然的。中英两国人民早已应该在一个目标之下亲密携手共同奋斗了，而中英人民的这一共同阵线，将是抵抗美国扩张政策的一个重要力量。
    为了发展两国的利益，中国人民充分了解英国对华商务的重要性，英国现在急迫需要对外贸易，其中对华贸易占着很重要的地位。中国人民为了自己的经济利益，也急迫需要在平等互惠的基础上与各友邦建立正常的商务关系。但是，蒋介石反动集团却成了这一发展的重大障碍，他以“中美商约”把中国的全部主权卖给美帝国主义，蒋宋孔陈四大买办家，已用美国的资本与商品独霸了中国的市场，并且为了讨好其主子美帝国主义，不惜用种种手段破坏中英人民的友好关系。由此可见，英国司法大臣佐威特在这次上院辩论中，一面指出中英贸易必须恢复，另一面着重说明“英国不愿看到中国受到任何一个集团或政党所强行的极权统治”，而愿意“与一个强大巩固的能忠实履行其义务的，并且是基于广泛的民主基础上的政府共事与往来”，这决不是没有根据的了。一年多来，中国共产党和全中国人民所努力的，就在于反对蒋介石集团的集权统治，建立一个有广泛民主基础的强大而巩固的民主联合政府。只有这样一个政府出现了，才能保证中国国内有真正和平民主的生活，而对外才能在平等互惠的基础上与各友邦建立政治、经济、文化各方面的真正友好关系。
    中国是在困难中熬煎，中国人民对于友邦人士的关怀不能不表示感激；对于要求英美苏盟邦严格履行三国外长会议所规定的义务，协助中国走向独立、和平与民主的建议自然也表示欢迎，但是我们要郑重指出，中国是一个历史悠久的伟大国家，中国人民对于自己的智慧与意志有足够的估计，他们最大的愿望是遵守莫斯科三强外长会议的“坚持不干涉中国内政事务之政策”，中国的事让中国人自己办。我们坚信中国人民能够按着全世界民主进步的轨道扫除自己障碍，解决自己的问题，使自己和各友邦都在平等的基础上“获致幸福的结果”。可以断言，中国人民决不会使英国人民和全世界民主人士失望。
