    Brigade Commander Carries Stretcher in Yangzhuang Battle
    On the last night of the Yangzhuang battle, the gunfire gradually subsided, heavy snow was falling. The tense battle had passed, and now the most urgent task was to transport the wounded. The leaders of a certain brigade appeared among the stretcher bearers, and everyone was excited and happy. Some said: "The brigade commander has been wounded seven times." Others said: "The director's leg is crippled." As for the political commissar and the chief of staff, everyone knew that they had been working day and night during the battle, and now they didn't rest for a moment and came to carry the wounded. Everyone's hearts were filled with admiration and respect. They admired the heroes for making such great contributions this time, and admired the leaders for taking such good care of the brave soldiers under their leadership. The leaders were covered in sweat. In the dark night, the muddy road was so slippery that they stood up and fell down, and fell down and stood up again. A young wounded soldier was so moved that he shed tears, his heart filled with countless words to say. Finally, he stammered, "Leaders, although I was wounded for the people, how can I let the leaders worry so much!" A soldier who was liberated from Shao'erzhai said: "When you are wounded as a soldier in the 'Central Army', no one cares even if the dogs eat you. Here, the leaders treat us like this, no matter how much blood I shed or how much pain I suffer, I am happy in my heart. I want to recuperate well and recover from my injuries soon to see the leaders."
    Section Chief Mu Ruiming and Wang Wenzhen, Li Zhonghe, and Cui Hongsheng carried a stretcher together. They had planned in advance, "We must make the wounded person smile, otherwise it will not be considered a success." So, they told jokes, sang Erhuang operas, and talked about the battle gains to the wounded all the way. They lit cigarettes for the wounded, asked about their well-being, took off their cotton coats and put them on the wounded, and after walking for a while, they asked, "If you feel uncomfortable anywhere, just say so, don't suffer." Then, they started telling stories. Sure enough, the wounded man on the stretcher smiled. He smiled and said, "You are too tired, you are too tired!"
    The wounded from the Yangzhuang battle were transferred to the hospital by the brigade and regimental leaders, cadres from various units, and staff members in this way.

    杨庄战斗中旅长抬担架
    杨庄战斗的最后一天晚上，枪声逐渐稀疏了，大雪纷飞着，紧张的战斗过去了，现在最紧张的是搬运彩号。某旅首长们出现在担架队里，大家又兴奋又愉快。有的说：旅长负过七次伤。有的说：主任腿是残废的。而政委和参谋长，大家都知道他们作战时日夜操劳，现在一刻儿也不休息，又来抬运彩号，大家心里充满了羡慕和钦佩。羡慕英雄们这回立下了这样大的功劳，钦佩首长这样爱护在他领导下的英勇的战士。首长们满头大汗，黑夜里，这样泥湿路滑，立起来又滑倒了，滑倒了又立起来。一个年青的负伤战士感动得流出泪来，他的心灵里不知道有多少话要说。最后，他吞吞吐吐的说道：“首长，我虽是为人民负了伤，怎能叫首长们操这样大的心！”一个在邵耳寨解放过来的战士说：“在‘中央军’里当兵挂彩，狗吃了也没人管。在这里首长们这样对我们，不管流多少血，受多大痛苦，我心里也高兴，我要好好休养，早点养好伤回来见首长。”
    股长穆瑞明和王文贞、李忠和、崔鸿声抬一付担架，他们事先就定下计划，“一定要使抬的伤员笑，不然不算成功。”于是，他们一路上给伤员说笑话，唱二簧，谈战斗缴获，给伤员点火吸烟，一面问寒问冷，把自己的棉衣脱下来给伤员盖上，走一会又问“那儿不好受你吭气，不要受了罪”。然后，又说起故事来。果然，抬子上的伤员笑了。他一边笑一边说道：“你们太辛苦了，你们太辛苦了！”
    杨庄战斗的伤员，就这样由旅团首长各单位干部和事务人员转送到医院里去。
