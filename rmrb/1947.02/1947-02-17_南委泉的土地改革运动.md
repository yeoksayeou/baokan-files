　　The Land Reform Movement in Nanweiquan
　　Xiao Hanqing
　　Four, Pursuit-style In-Depth Movement

　　Following the initial distribution of fruits, the in-depth movement of clearing out landlords began on January 9th.

　　After the great liquidation struggle, the farmers concentrated on distributing the fruits, and the movement stagnated, forming a state of being tight at first and then loose. On the 9th, the leadership raised the question in the winter school: "Has the feudal tail been cut off completely?" In this discussion, it was found that most farmers had fatigue, complacency, and negative thoughts. The poor peasant Fu Changming said: "There is no time to collect firewood, what will we burn for the New Year?" Some extremely poor peasants thought that "we also have land to cultivate, and we also have houses to live in," so it was "almost" enough. Some said: "There are quite a lot of things!" Some middle peasants, seeing that their names were not on the "filling the hole" list, said: "We struggled all winter, but it's not our share." So they became negative. In addition, due to the fact that in the previous stage of the struggle, the landlords used hypocritical words such as "exhausting property to repay debts" to deceive the peasants; on the other hand, they dispersed and concealed their wealth in the homes of relatives and friends early on, especially the things from the empty houses and cleared fields during the Anti-Japanese War, which were kept by honest farmers in mountain villages and earthen huts. These honest farmers also had some ideological concerns, so it was difficult to unearth the hidden property of the landlords. The reason why the landlords were stubbornly deadlocked in the liquidation struggle was also due to these conditions. Based on the above two situations, the leadership first inspired the peasants to further in-depth complaints, mobilized the masses to resolutely separate from the landlords, and the class consciousness of the peasants was further improved; then they proposed "not leaving a single tail for the feudal landlords!" and organized the masses to discuss.

　　Yao Wandan warned everyone at the meeting: "The landlords say they will try their best to repay their debts, but Gao Tingbi's lined jacket and single clothes, and Wang Shutian even hid the furniture they used." Everyone immediately launched an in-depth discussion: "What if the feudal tail is not cut off?" The activist Liang Haichao said: "If you want to turn over completely, you must expose the air-raid shelters." Fu Changming proposed: Peasants resolutely refuse to be the landlords' "air-raid shelters!"

　　After deliberation, a mass meeting to "find air-raid shelters" was held on the 12th. Gao Jigou shouted on the spot: "Air-raid shelters must be dug by ourselves!" Then he reported a cow of his family, Gao Tingbi, hidden in Niuju Village. Retired soldier Yang Linsen, voluntarily took out the cloth, robes, and shoes that Wang Shutian had hidden in his house. Women's Rescue Chairman Zhao Zhuxiu reported the ten thousand yuan banknotes that the landlord Gao Fuying had entrusted to her family for safekeeping. Fu Wende revealed Pei Senhu's three vats of soybeans. He Changbao revealed Gao Tingbi's five mu of land hidden in Beiweiquan. The masses were in high spirits.

　　Cadres and the masses boldly and finally tore their faces with the landlords. In order to promote the movement one step further, the leadership seized this enthusiasm and proposed a discussion method to reward conscious peasants who voluntarily reported, exposed, and inspected the hidden property of the landlords. Everyone unanimously decided: Anyone who acts as a "air-raid shelter" for the landlord should report it voluntarily within two days, and a reward of 50% will be given, and the poorest household will be given all of it; those who fail to report within the time limit and are found out will be dealt with by mass discussion; those who are found out by various methods will be rewarded with 60%. Gao Tingbi's cow was immediately discounted for 30,000 yuan, and Gao Jigou was awarded 15,000 yuan, Zhao Zhuxiu was awarded 5,000 yuan, and Yang Linsen was awarded cloth, robes, and shoes...

　　This reward method has become a very good way to investigate the hidden property of the landlords. In addition, a meeting of relatives of landlords was held, and the slogan "Be a poor friend, don't be a rich relative" was put forward. As a result, about a hundred households of landlords' relatives voluntarily reported or exposed the hidden property of the landlords. This experience was推广 (popularized/extended) to the whole region, and a squeeze in each village revealed a large amount of hidden property of the landlords. In just two days, the 12th and 13th, seventy-two "air-raid shelters" were smashed, and the current ocean alone reached more than 54,000 yuan. The peasants were in unprecedented high spirits. Wang Yuwen happily said: "This is a good way to eliminate feudalism!" Political Director Zhang Xiaoji also said: "This inspection is worth half a liquidation movement." Through this inspection, the class consciousness of the peasants was further improved, and they further realized the cunning face of the landlords.

　　Five, Fruit Distribution Eliminates All Impoverished Peasants

　　The struggle to attack the landlords for the second time was victorious. The political and economic rule of the landlord class was crushed. The peasants recovered the blood and sweat they had been plundered. Fourteen of the most fair people with "peasant standpoints" were elected to form an evaluation committee to carry out the distribution.

　　The preparation work for distributing the fruits was carried out in the winter school. The opinions of the masses were very inconsistent. Poor peasants such as Yang Dongcheng demanded that those who raised more opinions should be given more. Middle peasant Guan Jintang planned to "exchange bad houses for good houses." Middle peasants Tang Erguang and others wanted to seize the opportunity to separate their families in order to distribute more fruits. Some contradictions also occurred between villages. Nanweiquan produced more fruits and was always afraid of distributing too much to other villages. Villages such as Chapengtan repeatedly emphasized that they were very poor. As a result, Nanweiquan appraisers Li Furong and Jia Qiweng and Chapengtan appraisers Yuan Licun and Wang Jiexin argued with each other, so that the appraisal work could not proceed.

　　According to the slogans put forward by the leadership, such as "don't laugh with the landlords yourself," "everyone gets it and everyone shares it," "get what you need," and "the turned-over peasants help the un-turned-over brothers," everyone launched a new discussion. Each group criticized the "incorrect purpose" of separating families to seize the opportunity. Yuan Licun had a strong localism. Everyone used concrete facts to show that the land distributed in Chapengtan was not small and not bad. He also reflected on the incorrect thinking of "wanting to distribute more to himself and wanting to distribute more to his own village." Since then, everyone has united again in the distribution of fruits.

　　After the evaluation committee and the turnaround committee detailedly registered the number of fruits and the number of households without land or houses, after accurate calculation, and according to the opinions of each group, it was determined that each person should occupy two mu of land and one room as the standard. The principle is: those with no land or little land will be supplemented with land, those with nearby and good land will be distributed with remote and bad land, and productive trees such as walnuts and persimmons will be distributed to households without labor. The specific method is: first, each person puts forward their opinions according to their needs, and the turnaround group makes the first evaluation, submits the group's opinions to the evaluation committee for evaluation, the evaluation committee makes a decision, announces it in detail, lets everyone consider it individually, conducts group discussions, then the masses collectively discuss it once, submits it to the evaluation committee for re-evaluation and announcement, the masses discuss it again, and make the final decision.

　　During the distribution, everyone fully promoted the spirit of unity and mutual assistance. Activist Liang Haichao (new middle peasant) said: "Newly rich households are not as good as bankrupt rich households, and more should be distributed to those with deep gullies to fill them up." The distribution of livestock took care of households without labor, and the number of points was determined by the amount of labor. Some households were given a cow, and the minimum was ten households sharing a mule. Poor military dependents and retired soldiers were given special care. Retired soldier Huang Guoqiang, a family of two, was given five mu of good nearby land and two buildings. As a result, everyone was very satisfied. He Laoer, who moved down from Dongshan, said: "I never thought I would be able to live in a building and cultivate land that yields two dan and six dou per mu in my life."

　　After the movement of filling in the gaps, the original eighty-six extremely poor households without a foothold were divided into 402 mu, with an average of 1.83 mu per person, and all were upgraded to middle peasants. Because the land yield in this village is relatively high, one mu can harvest three dan and six dou, and the extremely poor (and the poor peasants) mostly distributed good land, so about two mu per person reached the middle peasant living standard. The poor peasants originally averaged 0.82 mu per person, and now average 1.82 mu per person, and all have been upgraded to middle peasants. Middle peasants now average 2.64 mu per person. Rich peasants average 3.84 mu per person. Except for the feudal rich peasants who reduced their land by 118.4 mu, the rich peasants who became rich through labor did not suffer losses. For example, Xu Guangfu (not a cadre), originally from Linxian, moved to Nanweiquan fifty years ago, and worked as a tenant farmer. All his land was reclaimed or purchased by transportation. Now he has a family of five and forty-eight mu of land, averaging more than nine mu per person, and was not touched in the movement. The landlords originally averaged 9.11 mu per person, with a total of 682.3 mu of land, and now average 2.62 mu per person, which is enough to maintain the living standard of middle peasants.

　　Six, Several Key Experiences

　　(1) Due to the deception and rascality of the landlords, and also because it was difficult for the peasants to "separate" from the landlords all at once, the peasants' fighting spirit rose and fell, making the movement present many twists and turns. Therefore, not only is it necessary to have necessary ideological preparation before the struggle, but also during the struggle, especially at major junctures of the movement, such as after a climax, it is especially necessary to vigorously implement ideological mobilization to ensure the fullness of the masses' fighting enthusiasm. Experience has shown that each in-depth ideological mobilization becomes the basis for a new climax. The main contents of ideological mobilization are two: one is to gradually and deeply guide the peasants to complain and constantly expose the landlords' conspiracies; the other is to constantly solve the internal contradictions of the masses ideologically. In addition to organizing complaints and discussions according to the needs of the struggle situation, the methods of ideological mobilization are especially necessary to put forward slogans and vivid materials (such as documents and postings hidden by the landlords for many years) in a timely manner.

　　Furthermore, ideological mobilization and militia guard work—or other methods—need to cooperate with each other. In Nanweiquan, throughout the entire movement, the militia patrolled day and night, monitoring the activities of the major bullies, reducing the worries of the peasants. Without this work, the destruction of the major bullies, or even taking the opportunity to escape, would affect the masses who had just been mobilized or were being mobilized, and increase their concerns.

　　(2) For the main objects that everyone hates, it is necessary to concentrate firepower and fight fiercely, and persist in fighting without stopping until they completely bow their heads. This struggle process is the process of winning over secondary objects. When the main object is fought to a certain extent, the problem can be solved smoothly by applying a gentler struggle to the secondary object. As a result of Nanweiquan's use of this method, the secondary objects took out no less hidden wealth than the main objects.

　　(3) "Digging air-raid shelters" is one of the basic contents of the in-depth movement, and it is also an important step to completely eliminate feudalism. In the old areas, especially after the great movements of 1942 and 1944, the movable and immovable property of the landlords had a certain amount of earlier and more rigorous hiding. Therefore, after one or two climaxes, the landlords still retained a certain economic power, and some peasants, even activists and cadres, still maintained certain connections with the landlords, so the landlords still had a certain influence among the peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all the peasants, and finally tear their faces with the landlords, "separate their families," and dig out the landlords' "air-raid shelters" completely. This not only has significant economic significance, but also has significant political significance.

　　(4) Repeated democratic discussions to obtain the satisfaction of all peasants is one of the basic methods of distributing fruits. Nanweiquan did not spend more effort on assessing grades and calculating methods, but spent a lot of time on mass discussions, and as a result, everyone was very satisfied. This experience can also be used as a reference in various places.

　　南委泉的土地改革运动
    萧寒青
    四、追击性的深入运动
    紧接初步分果实之后，清查地主的深入运动，于一月九日开始。
    在大清算斗争之后，农民集中力量分配果实，运动停滞，形成先紧后松的状态。九日，领导上在冬学里提出：“封建尾巴是不是已经割净？”在这次讨论中，发现大部农民存在疲劳，自满与消极思想。贫农傅长命说：“连打柴的工夫也没有，过年烧什么？”另有些赤贫农以为“也有地种了，也有房子住了”，“差不多”了。有的说：“东西可不少了呀！”一部分中农，见“填窟窿”的榜上没有自己的名子，有的就说：“白斗了一冬天，没咱的份。”于是消极起来。另外，由于前一阶段斗争中，地主一面伪善以“尽财产还账”的空话欺骗农民；一面早早将财物分散掩藏于亲友邻家，特别是抗战中间空舍清野的东西，由山庄窝铺的老实农民保管起来，这些老实农民又有些思想顾虑，因而地主的隐蔽财产发掘较难，地主之所以在清算斗争中要死顽固，也仰仗于这些条件。领导上根据上述两种情况，首先启发农民进一步的深入诉苦，发动群众坚决和地主分家，农民阶级觉悟遂更加提高；接着提出“不给封建地主留一点尾巴”！组织群众讨论。
    姚完旦在会上警告大家：“地主们说尽量还账，高廷璧的夹衣单衣，王书田连使用的家具都藏起来了。”大家当即展开深入讨论：“封建尾巴割不净怎么办？”积极分子梁海潮说：“想翻透身，必须揭破防空洞。”傅长命提出：农民坚决不当地主“防空洞”！
    经过酝酿，十二日举行了“找防空洞”的群众大会。高计狗当场高喊：“防空洞要自己挖！”遂将本家高廷璧藏在牛居村的一头牛报告出来。荣退军人杨林森，自动拿出王书田藏在他家的布、袍、鞋。妇救主席赵竹秀报出地主高富英交他家保藏的万元钞票。傅文得揭发出裴森虎的三缸黄豆。何长保揭露高廷璧隐藏在北委泉的五亩地。群众情绪高涨异常。
    干部和群众大胆的最后的向地主撕破脸了。为使运动提高一步，领导上抓紧此种热情，提出讨论办法，奖励自报、揭发、检查地主隐藏财产的自觉农民。大家一致决定：凡给地主当“防空洞”者，两天内自动报出，提奖百分之五十，最穷的户，则全部奖给；过期不报而被查出者，由群众讨论处理；用各种方法调查出者，提奖百分之六十。并当场将高廷璧的牛折价三万，奖给高计狗万五千元，奖赵竹秀五千元，奖杨林森以布、袍、鞋………。
    这种奖励办法，成为清查地主隐藏财产的很好方式。加以召开了地主亲属会议，提出：“能为一个穷朋友，别为一个富亲戚”的口号。结果有百户左右地主亲戚自报或揭发了地主的隐蔽财产。这一经验推广到了全区，各村一挤，地主隐蔽财产大量暴露出来。总计在十二、十三两日内，即捣出七十二个“防空洞”，光现洋即达五万四千余元。农民情绪空前高涨，王玉文高兴的说：“这才是消灭封建的好办法！”政治主任张孝吉也说：“这个检查，顶住半个清算运动。”经这次检查，农民阶级觉悟更加提高，进一步认识了地主的狡猾面目。
    五、果实分配赤贫农全部消灭
    二次进攻地主的斗争胜利了，地主阶级的政治经济统治会摧垮，农民收回了被掠夺的血汗果实，选出十四个最公正的有“农民立场”的人，组成评议委员会，进行分配。
    分果实的酝酿工作，是在冬学里进行的。群众意见很不一致。贫农杨冬成等，要求提意见多的人多分。中农关金堂打算“以歹房换好房”。中农唐二广等户为了多分果实，想趁机分家。村与村之间也发生了些矛盾。南委泉斗出的果实较多，老怕多分给了外村。茶棚滩等村又一再强调他们穷得厉害。结果南委泉评议员李富荣、贾其文和茶棚滩评议员袁礼存、王戒心顶起嘴来，以致评议工作无法进行下去。
    根据领导上提出的“自己不和地主笑”，“大家得来大家分”，“需要什么分什么”，“翻身农民帮助未翻身弟兄”等口号，大家展开了新的讨论。各小组都批评了趁机分家的“目的不对”。袁礼存本位思想很重，大家用具体事实说明茶棚滩分的地不少也不坏。他也反省了“自己想多分，想叫自己村多分”的不正确思想。此后，大家在分果实中又团结起来。
    评议委员会与翻身委员会在详细的登记了果实数目、没地没房户数目之后，经精确计算，并根据各组意见，确定每人以占有二亩地一间房为标准。原则是：无地少地的补地，有近地、好地的分远地、坏地，核桃、柿子等生产树全分给无劳力户。具体作法是：先由各人根据需要提出意见，经过翻身小组作第一次评议，把小组意见提交评委会评议，评委会作出决定，详细公布，让大家各自考虑后，进行小组讨论，再由群众集体讨论一次，交评委会复评公布，群众再讨论一次，作出最后决定。
    在分配时，大家充分发扬了团结互助精神。积极分子梁海潮（新中农）说：“新发户不如破财主，圪道深的多分才能填平。”牲口的分法，照顾了无劳力户，以劳力多少决定分数，有的一户分了一头牛，最少的是十户分一头骡子。贫苦军属及荣退军人，都得到特别照顾。退伍军人黄国强，二口人，分了五亩好近地，二间楼。结果大家都很满意。从东山搬下来的何老二说：“一辈子没想到能住住楼，种种二石六斗产量的地。”
    经过填平补齐运动，原先无立锥之地的八十六户赤贫，分得四○二亩，每人平均一·八三亩，全部上升为中农。因该村土地产量较高，一亩能收小石三石六斗，赤贫（贫农亦然）多是分的好地，故每人二亩左右即达中农生活水平。贫农原来每人平均·八二亩，现每人平均一·八二亩，全部上升为中农。中农现每人平均二·六四亩。富农每人平均三·八四亩，除封建富农减地一一八·四亩外，劳动发家的富农未受损失。如许光富（不是干部），原籍林县，移至南委泉已五十年，当过佃户，其土地全系开荒或运输购买的，现五口人，四十八亩地，每人平均九亩多，运动中未动。地主原来每人平均九·一一亩，共有地六八二·三亩，现每人平均二·六二亩，足够维持中农生活水平。
    六、几点主要经验
    （一）由于地主的欺骗和无赖，也由于农民一下子难于和地主“分家”，故农民斗争情绪一起一伏，使运动呈现颇多的曲折。因此，不仅在斗争前须有必要的思想酝酿，在斗争中，特别是运动的重大关头，如一个高潮过后，尤须大力贯彻思想发动，以保证群众斗争热气的饱满。经验证明：每一次的深入思想发动，都成为新的高潮的基础。思想发动的主要内容有二：一为逐步深入的引导农民诉苦与不断揭发地主的阴谋；一为不断从思想上解决群众内部矛盾。思想发动的方法，除了根据斗争形势的需要，组织诉苦与讨论外，及时的提出口号与活生生的材料（如地主隐藏多年的文书揭帖等）尤为必要。
    再，思想发动与民兵的警戒工作——或其他方法，有互相配合的必要。南委泉在运动全程中，民兵日夜巡逻，监视大恶霸的活动，给农民减少了顾虑。没有这一工作，大恶霸的破坏，甚至乘机逃脱，都会给刚发动或发动中的群众以影响，增加顾虑。
    （二）对人人痛恨的主要对象，要集中火力狠斗，并坚持不歇的斗下去，直到他们完全低头。这个斗争过程，就是争取次要对象的过程。当主要对象斗到一定程度时，对次要对象施以较缓和的斗争，问题即可顺利解决。南委泉采用此种方法的结果，次要对象比主要对象拿出的暗财并不少。
    （三）“挖防空洞”是深入运动的基本内容之一，又是彻底消灭封建的重要步骤。在老区，特别是经过了一九四二、四四年的大运动，地主的动产与不动产，均有一定数量较早的与较为严密的隐藏起来。故在一次二次高潮过后，地主仍保有一定的经济势力，若干农民，甚至积极分子和干部，仍与地主保持着某些联系，因而地主在农民中仍有一定的影响。因此，需要发动全体农民，最后的和地主撕破脸，“分开家”，把地主的“防空洞”挖个干净。这不仅有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义。
    （四）反复经过民主讨论，取得全体农民的满意，是分配果实的基本方法之一。南委泉没有在评定等级、计算方法上花更多的功夫，但在群众讨论上却花费了不少时间，结果大家很满意。这一经验各地也可参考。  
    （完）
