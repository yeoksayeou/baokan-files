    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 4th: Shanghai dispatch: After the U.S. government's reactionary policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war suffered strong opposition from the Chinese and American people, in addition to continuing to find ways to openly aid Chiang under various pretexts, it is now secretly transporting military supplies to aid Chiang, using Taiwan as a base. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek is also selling out Taiwan in exchange. Half of the U.S. military supplies delivered to Taiwan, located in Taipei and Keelung, have been transported to various places in Central and North China to supply Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war. The Chiang Kai-shek government has allowed the U.S. military to establish a military port in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, which is being built by the U.S. military and will be completed in February this year. The Chiang government has also allowed the U.S. military to establish an airfield and aircraft repair plant in Xitun Township, Taichung, which is also being built by the U.S. military and will be completed in June.

    蒋竟出卖台湾作交换
    【新华社延安四日电】上海讯：美国政府援蒋内战的反动政策遭受中美人民有力反对之后，现除继续设法以各种借口公开援蒋外，正以台湾为基地秘密运输军火援蒋。同时，蒋介石亦以出卖台湾作为交换。美方输交台湾之军火，其在台北基隆者，已有二分之一运至华中、华北各地，供给蒋介石打内战。蒋介石政府则允许美军在台湾南部高雄设军港，该港正由美军建筑，将于今年二月竣工于今年。蒋政府又允美军在台中之西屯乡设立飞行场及飞机修理厂，亦由美军建筑，将六月竣工。
