Reading Letters from Home
A Glimpse into the Life of Frontline Troops
Wang Minzhao

On Lunar New Year's Eve, the snowflakes fell thicker and faster.

The room was packed with people – boiling water, warming themselves by the fire, singing, playing instruments – turning the Fifth Company's sickroom into a temporary club.

Model Company Commander Hao Rulian, for the past few days, had been working tirelessly to help the soldiers treat scabies. He was busy from morning till night, chopping wood, carrying water, helping the soldiers wash and apply medicine, and wash clothes. Even at mealtime, he held his bowl next to the stove to stoke the fire. When someone told him to eat first and then stoke the fire, he always said, "It's convenient, it doesn't matter, it's a sure thing I won't spill the rice into the stove." Now, he'd washed his face and was singing a Wuxiang Yangge folk song in the room.

"Quartermaster, give us a quick-talk rhyme!"

At everyone's shout, the lively Quartermaster immediately recited: "Our cooks, guarantee they won't make undercooked rice… The platoon's messenger, seeing the company commander blackened with smoke, without a word, without persuasion, automatically goes to fetch boiling water…"

People stamped their feet and clapped their hands along with him, adding to the lively singing, when someone outside shouted:

"Cheng Dequan, Cheng Dequan!"

Cheng Dequan was stoking the fire, his face flushed red. The person who came in handed him something: "Here, a letter from home."

"Read the letter aloud!" everyone shouted again. No matter whose letter it was, everyone liked to hear it. Cheng Dequan opened the letter and handed it to the person next to him to read without even looking at it himself. It was written by his brother.

"Brother, everyone at home is well, please don't worry."

Cheng Dequan smiled slightly.

"This time, during the mass movement, our family's land in Daochang Gully was given to the masses, I think you'll agree…"

Everyone glanced at Cheng Dequan, who was still smiling.

"The village cadres distributed the fruits of victory to us: a set of clothes, half of the pear orchard that Cheng Delin donated, and a sheep…"

"That's right, what belongs to others should be given to them," Cheng Dequan waved his right hand, as if pushing the land in Daochang Gully away, while simultaneously grabbing it back with his left hand, "What is rightfully ours is truly ours."

Old Zhang, who was reading the letter, pulled another piece of paper out of the envelope. "Hey, Zhou Mingda, there's a letter for you too, written by the village cadres."

"Read it, read it," Zhou Mingda said before anyone could ask him to.

"During this mass movement in our village, the poor have all turned over."

Everyone nodded and applauded.

"You've been allocated 2,500 yuan in silver dollars…"

"Louder, Old Zhang, read it louder!" a scabies patient shouted from the bed.

"Two thousand five hundred yuan," Old Zhang raised his voice, "a robe, more than one stone of grain, and we will be responsible for helping to solve all other difficulties. We hope you won't worry, and will focus on your work, strive for model worker status, and fight for the revolution…"

"Good, Mingda, very good!"

During the scabies treatment campaign, Zhou Mingda really became a model worker.

From the corner of the room, someone shouted:

"Mingda, Dequan, protect the fruits of the liberation!"

"Of course!" the two answered in unison, like singing.

The quick-talk rhyme of the Yangge couldn't go on, and many people took out their letters and read them in turn. The New Year's Eve entertainment turned into a home letter reading party.

The snow outside the window fell even harder, and the laughter in the room grew brighter and brighter, like the sunlight after the first snow.

    读家信
    前线部队生活之一角
    王敏昭
    旧历年除夕，鹅毛雪飞得越来越密。
    房子里挤满了人，烧水的、烤火的、唱的、打家伙的，把五连的病号室变为临时俱乐部。
    模范连长郝如连同志，几天来为了突击帮助战士们治疥，他一天忙到晚，不是劈柴，就是担水，帮助战士洗疥擦药、洗衣服，吃饭时都还捧着碗在灶旁边烧火。有人叫他吃完饭再烧，他总是说：“现成，不碍事，保险不会把饭扒到灶里去。”现在也洗了脸，在房子里唱起武乡秧歌来。
    “事务长，来一段快板吧。”
    大家一喊，活宝事务长就顺口念出来了：“咱们的炊事班，保证做不下生米饭………连部的通讯员，看见连长熏成黑煤炭，不用说，不用劝，自动去把开水担。………”
    人们踏着脚拍着掌替他和着、正在唱得热闹关头，外边有人喊叫：
    “程德泉，程德泉”。
    程德泉正在烧火，脸烤得红红的。进来的人塞给他一件东西：“拿，你的家信。”
    “念念家信！”大家又喊起来，不管谁的家信来，大家都愿意听听的。程德泉把信拆开，还没有看就交给旁边的人念起来了，这是他兄弟写来的。
    “哥哥，咱家人都安康，请你不必挂念”。
    程德泉微笑着。
    “这次群众运动把咱道昌沟的地献与群众，我想你是同意的………。”
    大家都向程德泉望了一眼，他还是微笑着。
    “村干部给咱分配胜利果实，衣服一套，程德林献下的梨园一半，绵羊一个………。”
    “对嘛，该人家的献给人家”，程德泉右手一甩，像是把道昌沟的地推出去了，同时左手一把抓了回来，“该分给咱的才真正是咱的。”
    念信的老张又从信封里拉出一张纸来，“喂，周明达，也有你的信，村干部写来的”。
    “念吧，念吧，”周明达不等大家叫就说。
    “这次咱村群众运动，穷人都翻了身”。
    大家都点头鼓掌。
    “给你们分大洋二千五百元………。”
    “大声一点，老张，念大声一点”，疥号同志在床上喊。
    “二千五百元”，老张提高了嗓子，“袍子一件，粮食一石多，其余一切困难，我们负责帮助解决。希你不必挂念，好好安心工作，为革命奋斗，争取工作模范………。”
    “好呀，明达，真好呀”！
    在治疥运动中，周明达真的成为工作模范了。
    房角里，不知是谁在叫：
    “明达、德泉，要保卫翻身果实啊”！
    “当然罗”！两人齐声应着，像唱歌一样。
    秧歌的快板唱不下去了，许多人都掏出信来轮流着念，除夕的娱乐变成了家信朗读晚会。
    窗外的雪下得更大了，屋子里的笑声像初雪后的太阳光一样，越来越明亮。
