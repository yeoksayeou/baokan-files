　　Lin County, Ren Village
    Cadres Return Excess Fruit
    [This newspaper's correspondent in Taihang, 20th dispatch] During the in-depth movement in Ren Village, Lin County, the leadership proposed a thorough emancipation, but the masses were not enthusiastic. The reason was found to be that cadres had distributed too much fruit, and the masses had complaints. The leadership immediately educated the cadres to "wash their faces" and encouraged the masses to raise opinions. At the mass meeting, the political director first reflected, saying: "In the past, I embezzled a woolen sweater, cheaply bought a courtyard, and a hillside. I am very sorry to the masses and am determined to return them." The town head said: "I privately issued a pass to let my father-in-law (a landlord) go. This is a matter of losing my position," and he also returned three mu of land that he had taken too much of on the spot. Under their influence, other cadres also made self-criticisms and returned things. The masses were greatly moved and also automatically made self-criticisms. Hu He said: "I listened to the bad words of the landlord's special agents and once tried to defeat the village cadres. Today, I realize I was wrong." Everyone said, "In the future, we must unite well and be careful not to be fooled by the landlord's special agents."
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Licheng] In Qiushuyuan Village, Third District of Licheng, cadres voluntarily returned excess fruit, and farmers voluntarily reported land and property hidden for landlords, realizing "filling the gaps" throughout the village. Village cadre Yang Shutang had divided a little too much fruit, and automatically admitted his mistake at the meeting, requesting a reduction. The masses thought that knowing the problem was enough, so they only allowed him to return a crock. Jiang Xiuqi, the current district cadre, also voluntarily returned land he had taken too much of. Militia instructor Niu Fushun also voluntarily returned property he had taken too much of. In Wangmiao's "air raid shelter," farmer Zhao Qijia voluntarily reported that he had preserved more than sixty pieces of landlord's clothing, gaining the support of the entire village. Influenced by this, farmers Li Fengming and Dong Yinjiang also reported the fields and properties they had concealed for the landlord, totaling thirty mu of land, thirty-two rooms of kiln, nine head of livestock, and eleven shi and four dou of grain, filling the "gaps" for the entire village.

　　林县任村
    干部退出多分果实
    【本报太行二十日电】林县任村在深入运动时，领导上提出彻底翻身，群众情绪不高，检查原因是干部多分果实，群众有意见，领导上当即教育干部洗脸，启发群众提意见。群众会上政治主任首先反省说：“我过去贪污过一件毛衣，贱买了一座院，一个山坡，太对不住群众，决心退出来。”镇长说：“我私开路条放走俺岳父（地主），这是丧失立场的事”，也当场退出多分之三亩地。在他们影响下，其他干部也作了检讨退东西。群众大受感动，也自动检讨，胡和说：“我听了地主特务的坏话，曾企图打垮村干部，今日才知道不对。”大家都说：“以后咱们可得团结好，小心上地主特务的当。”
    【本报黎城讯】黎城三区秋树垣村干部自退多得果实，农民自报代地主隐藏之土地财物，全村实现了填平补齐。该村干部杨树棠果实分多了些，自动在会上认错，请求减少，群众认为知道毛病就行，结果只允他退出一口缸。江秀奇现任区干部，也自动退出多分的地。民兵指导员牛福顺也自动退出多分的财物。在王庙“防空洞”农民赵其家，自动报出保存地主衣服六十多件，得到全村拥护。影响农民李凤鸣、董引江也都报出替地主掩藏的田产，计地三十亩、窑三十二间、牲口九头、粮十一石四，填平了全村的“圪道户”。
