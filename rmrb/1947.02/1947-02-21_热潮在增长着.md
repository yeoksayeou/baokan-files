Short commentary:

    Since Comrade Bo Yibo issued the call for production and thrift to welcome the dawn, many rear-area organizations have entered the movement one after another, and the upsurge of production and thrift is growing. Deputy Commander Teng has specifically commended this, and this upsurge, like our glorious army fighting victoriously at the front, demonstrates the heroic spirit that the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas should have in this great combat era. However, at the same time, it should also be noted that a small number of rear-area organizations have not been fully mobilized, and weaknesses such as a "warming the bench" mentality, fatigue, fear of trouble, and a lack of the spirit to overcome difficulties have not been completely eliminated. The upsurge that has already been created must be further expanded and enriched. We call on all rear-area organizations, schools, and groups to take action without exception and enter the movement. Leading administrative comrades should take the lead and set an example. Every Party branch and every Communist Party member should play a leading and backbone role in the movement. We should immediately begin to formulate individual and organizational production and thrift plans, and carry out merit-making campaigns to unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and ensure the completion of this major political task.

　　热潮在增长着
    薄一波同志做了生产节约迎接光明的号召以后，许多后方机关一个接一个进入运动，生产节约的热潮正在增长。滕副司令员为此特提出了表扬，这种热潮正如我们光荣的军队在前方胜利作战一样，表现了解放区军民在伟大战斗时代应有的英雄气概。但同时还应注意，少数后方机关没有充分发动起来，烤火、疲踏的情绪，以及害怕麻烦，缺乏克服困难精神等弱点还未完全肃清。已经造成的热潮还须进一步加以扩大和充实。我们号召一切后方机关、学校、团体无例外的行动起来，进入运动。行政负责同志应亲自动手，以身作则。每个党的支部，每个共产党员应在运动中起带头和骨干作用。应立刻开始制定个人和机关的生产节约计划，并开展立功运动以发挥群众的积极性和创造性，保证这一重大政治任务的完成。
