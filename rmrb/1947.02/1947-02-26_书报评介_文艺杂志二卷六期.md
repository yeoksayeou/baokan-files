Book and Newspaper Review
Literary Magazine, Volume 2, Issue 6

Literary Magazine, Volume 2, Issue 6 has been published. This publication was founded last year and has now been running for a full year. In this year, it has achieved great success, serving the actual struggle with literary forms, absorbing and uniting a large number of literary writers, and encouraging and cultivating many practical work cadres to create, opening up the foundation for a mass literary movement. Moreover, it has practiced and continues to practice the general goal of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many works closely grasp the themes of the people's struggle and the people's liberation. The strong realism is its consistent characteristic.

Like the people's soldiers constantly strive to improve their skills in killing the enemy, the Literary Magazine is also constantly improving. Volume 2, Issue 6 may give readers the greatest impression: the works are quite neat, and many vividly reflect reality. From this, we deeply feel that it should not be seen as just a magazine, but as a book of accusations, a hymn to the people's heroes. The endless pain and sorrow that the big tyrant Chiang Kai-shek has given to the people, was so in the past, and still is now. "The Flesh Forever Hanging in My Heart" (Run Cang), "Dad is Back" (Lin Shichai), "The Hunter's Mother" (Ke Gang), "The Refugee" (Shu Tiangong), etc. are not just tragic stories and poems, but strong accusations against the big tyrant Chiang Kai-shek, filled with a high degree of hatred. This hatred can inspire the will of the fighters.

Only by understanding hatred can one better understand love. "Pausing the Qin River" (Ji Mu), "Little Militia" (Li Zi), "Stories of Heroes on the Front Lines" (written by Bing Ru), "Broken Arm Still Asking to Go to the Front Lines" (written by He Tian), etc., depict the unyielding character of the people's heroes, which consciously grows out of hatred for the big tyrant Chiang Kai-shek and love for their own lives, love for the land, and love for their parents and wives. These works vividly depict and record such heroic figures, which is a manifestation of the magazine's enhanced realism and militancy.

The future efforts of the Literary Magazine, as stated in "A Year's Review of the Magazine," will be: First, adopt the method of directly serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strive to write more texts that ordinary people can understand and read; second, launch research and criticism, and write boldly and boldly give play to creativity. The magazine has obviously begun to pay attention to opening up this path. Several poems can be easily understood, such as "The Hunter's Mother," which is a better work. In terms of drama, the greatest possible use of "dramatic language" stems from practical analysis of several scripts ("Li Zicheng" and "Defend the Good Times," etc.) and is permeated with theoretical guidance, with many insightful views. These efforts of the Literary Magazine will be of great benefit to the development of the Taihang literary movement. (Bo)

　　书报评介
    文艺杂志二卷六期
    文艺杂志二卷六期出版了，该刊于去年创刊，至今已整整一年。这一年，它的成绩是很大的，以文艺形式服务了实际斗争，吸收与团结了大批文艺写作者的执导，并鼓励与培养了不少实际工作干部动手创作，开辟了群众性文艺运动的基础。而且，它实践了与继续实践为工农兵服务的总目标，有不少作品，紧紧抓住了人民的战斗、人民的翻身等主题，现实性的强烈，是它一贯保持的特色。
    像人民战士不断努力改进自己杀敌技术一样，文艺杂志也不断在改进中。二卷六期可能给读者最大的印象：作品都相当整齐，且有不少是生动地反映了现实。从中让我们深切感到：不应单单是成一本杂志，应该看成：它是一本控诉书，是一本人民英雄的赞美诗。大恶霸蒋介石所给予人民的是无尽的痛苦和悲愁，过去是如此，现在还是如此，《永远挂在我心上的肉》（润苍）、《爸爸回来了》（林十柴）、《猎人之母》（柯岗）、《逃难者》（舒天巩）等都是些只是凄惨的故事和诗篇，而是对大恶霸蒋介石的强烈控诉，充溢了高度的憎恨，这种憎恨可以激发战斗者的意志。
    懂得憎恨，才更懂得爱。《暂停沁河》（棘木）、《小民兵》（李紫）、《前线英雄故事》（炳如写）、《打断了胳膊还是求上火线》（河田写）等，描绘了人民英雄不屈的性格，就是从对大恶霸蒋介石的憎恨和对自己生活的爱、土地的爱、父母妻子的爱，自觉成长起来的。这些作品生动地描绘与纪录了这样的英雄人物，这是文艺杂志的现实性与战斗性更加增强的表现。
    文艺杂志今后努力的方面，像“该刊一年回顾”所说，它将来：一、采取直接为工农兵服务的方法，努力多写点老百姓能懂能读的文字；二、展开研究批评，并大胆的写，大胆的发挥创造性。该刊显然已开始注意开避这一门径，几篇诗都能做到通俗易懂，如《猎人之母》即为较好之作。在剧作方面，尽量的“剧话”，是从几处剧本（《李自成》和《保卫好时光》等）实际的分析出发而又贯穿了理论指导，有不少精辟的见解。文艺杂志的这些努力，对太行文艺运动的发展，会有很大的好处。（波）
