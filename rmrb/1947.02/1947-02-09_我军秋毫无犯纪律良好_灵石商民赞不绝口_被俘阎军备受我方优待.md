    Our Army Commits No Offenses and Maintains Excellent Discipline:
    Lingshi Merchants and Residents Praise Enthusiastically;
    Captured Yan Soldiers Receive Excellent Treatment from Our Side
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] Merchants and residents of Lingshi county town unanimously praised the Eighth Route Army's excellent discipline of committing no offenses. After entering the city, the Eighth Route Army engaged in fair buying and selling and did not enter civilian houses. All merchants and residents did not suffer any loss. Grocery store owner Guo Weizhi said, "There has never been such a good army. When they came to my shop, they didn't even lift the counter door." Although the Yan army spread rumors saying, "The Eighth Route Army kills and sets fires," the residents all hoped for the Eighth Route Army to enter the city. Mr. Zhang Shengeng said, "I experienced the Eighth Route Army entering the city last August, who doesn't know the good discipline of the Eighth Route Army!" When the troops' discipline team checked the mass discipline house by house, the shopkeeper of Zhongxiangzhai said, "They even paid me fifty Jicha notes for buying a pen nib from me." An old lady next to him added with a smile, "The Eighth Route Army are all good people, not to mention discipline, they don't even want a pinch of tobacco."
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 6th] More than 700 prisoners, including Guan Chaoyuan, the major deputy head of the Bao Sixth Regiment, captured in the battle to liberate Lingshi, passed through a certain village in Lingshi on the 31st. This reporter made a special trip to visit them. The first to speak with the reporter was Nan Tianzhen, a lieutenant quartermaster of the Third Battalion of the Bao Sixth Regiment, who said, "Yan Xishan said that the Eighth Route Army brutally kills and loots. Now I have personally experienced that these are all slanderous propaganda, nothing more than used to deceive us into selling our lives for his personal gain." A military doctor named Yang Yuping standing next to him said that because the Eighth Route Army had learned from a friend who was captured and then released that the Eighth Route Army did not abuse prisoners and treated them well, he did not run away after the Eighth Route Army entered the city, but surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. The reporter also interviewed Wang Shihua, the wife of Liu Guozhen, the puppet county magistrate of Lingshi County. She was holding her three-year-old daughter and feeding her milk. She told the reporter, "The Eighth Route Army is very good, pays attention to politeness and morality, and there is no abuse. They treat us very considerately." Now she lives in a very clean and warm room. She said, "We are also unwilling to fight a civil war. Why should Chinese people fight Chinese people?" As she was speaking, an Eighth Route Army soldier brought a watch that another Yan army family member had lost on the battlefield. The family member was so moved that tears streamed down her face and said, "The Eighth Route Army is so good, the Eighth Route Army is so good!" Finally, the reporter met Guan Chaoyuan, the deputy head of the Bao Sixth Regiment, who was being served dinner by two receptionists. He was captured in the city and witnessed the strict discipline of our army. He praised, "After the battle ended, the Eighth Route Army brigade immediately moved outside the city. A small number of military police patrolled the city, the order was well maintained, and not a single soldier entered civilian houses privately or forcibly bought goods from stores."

    我军秋毫无犯纪律良好
    灵石商民赞不绝口
    被俘阎军备受我方优待
    【本报太岳七日电】灵石城关商民对八路军秋毫无犯的良好纪律一致赞不绝口。八路军在入城后公买公卖，不入民房，所有商民均未受丝毫损失，杂货店老板郭维之说：“从来也没有这样好的队伍。到我铺子里连柜户门也没揭起过。”虽然阎军造谣说：“八路军杀人放火”，但居民却都盼望八路军进城。张生梗先生说：“去年八月间八路军进城，我是经过的，谁还不知道八路军的纪律好！”当部队的纪律组挨户检查群众纪律时，中祥斋的掌柜说：“就是买了我一个笔尖，还给了我五十元冀钞。”旁边的老太太带笑补充说：“八路军可都是好人，不要说鸡驴（纪律）了，连烟叶都不要一把。”
    【本报太岳六日电】解放灵石战役之俘虏保六团少校副团长关朝元以下七百余人，三十一日道经灵石某村，记者特往访问。与记者首先谈话的是保六团三大队中尉军需南天珍，他说：“阎锡山说八路军如何如何的残杀抢夺，现在亲身体验到这都是污蔑的宣传，无非是用来欺骗我们为他个人卖命。”立在旁边的一个军医杨玉平说，因为八路军曾从一位被俘虏后释放的一个朋友口中了解八路军不虐杀俘虏而且优待，所以八路军入城后他没有逃跑，而投了八路军。记者又访问灵石县伪县长刘国珍的妻子王世华，她正抱着三岁的女孩子喂奶，她对记者说：“八路军很好，讲究礼貌道德，没有任何打骂，对我们招呼得很周到。”现在她住在一间非常清洁又暖和的房间。她说：“我们也不愿意打内战，中国人为什么要打中国人呢？”正说话间，有一个八路军战士送来一个手表，是另一个阎军眷属在战场上遗失的。这位眷属感动得连眼泪都流出来说：“八路军真好，八路军真好！”最后，记者见到保六团副团长关朝元，正有两个招待员侍候晚餐，他在城内被俘，目睹我军军纪严格，他赞扬的说：“在战斗结束后，八路军大队立即搬到城外，城内由少数纠察队巡逻，秩序井然，没有一个战士私入民房，或向商店强买物品的。”
