    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, February 7th: The people's self-defense guerrilla warfare in the Subei Yancheng-Huaihai area has spread to all parts. Within the first seven days of the Chiang troops' occupation of Yancheng, the suburban guerrillas launched five attacks, killing and capturing 26 Chiang soldiers. The Chiang troops in the city were terrified, burned down the bridge on the main road in the west, and dared not go to the west of the river at night. On January 9th, the local armed forces in Suqian attacked the Chiang army stronghold in Zhuo Wei, eight miles east of the city, using three hand grenades to wipe out a Chiang-controlled town office, capturing all personnel and weapons. On the same day, the Chiang army in Xugou, Huaiyin, launched an attack, but was blocked by the militia, resulting in more than ten casualties. Since the masses in Sheyang County (20 miles east of Funing) launched the campaign to establish merit through persisting in the on-the-spot struggle, they have annihilated 51 enemies in 20 days. On January 23rd, the Huaihai local troops ambushed a company of Xu Nili's (traitor Xu's) troops who were attacking from Xiangji, Guanyun, and on January 25th, they ambushed a part of the 28th Division of the Chiang army, more than 500 strong, who were advancing towards Lizhuang and Hou Xuzhuang, and won complete victories. On the night of the 27th, the local troops took the initiative to attack the "vagabond troops" harassing the northwest area of Dayishan (south of Guanyun), and at one fell swoop defeated the enemy in Mengji, Qingdun, and Shimen. According to statistics from the Yancheng-Huaihai areas from December 20th to January 17th and the Huaihai area for the first seven days of late January, a total of 402 Chiang soldiers and "Homecoming Legions" were killed, wounded, or captured, two machine guns and 112 long and short guns were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, February 5th: The local armed forces and militia of the New Fourth Army in Central Jiangsu launched widespread attacks. According to incomplete statistics, from New Year's Day to the 12th, they captured, killed, or wounded 409 Chiang soldiers, including Chiang army battalion commanders, Chiang's "Homecoming Legion" regimental commanders, and "Self-Defense Force" captains. They recovered 17 Chiang army strongholds, including Ya'erzhuang in Taixian, Wangdaqiao in Gaoyou, Daxiaozhujiazhuang in Rugao, Xixie Xiaohai and Xizha in Tai(Dongtai)bei which were twice occupied by Chiang's army, Mao Shan and Zhongguankou in Qintong (New County), and seized one 82mm mortar, eight light and heavy machine guns, four grenade launchers, 119 long and short guns, and recovered ten civilian ships and 70 dan of grain. Wangdaqiao was a fortified stronghold of the Chiang army on the Lin (Ze)-Jie (Shou) highway, with four bunkers and underground works. It was captured by local armed forces in just one hour of combat, and all the defending enemies were captured.
