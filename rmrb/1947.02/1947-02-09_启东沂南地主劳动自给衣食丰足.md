Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: Qidong landlord Song Yiqian, after the land reform, the whole family participated in labor and were abundant in food and clothing, which was highly praised by the masses. The Song family were hereditary landlords, owning 438 mu of land. He once served as a puppet township head and was deprived of his civil rights for six months during the suppression of traitors (now restored). In the land reform, he should have been allocated 7,800 bu of land (each 1,000 bu is equivalent to 4 mu), but the masses reduced it by 100 bu due to his collaboration with the enemy. During the land review, the masses saw that his whole family was enthusiastic about labor and added 100 bu back to him. His old mother and two long-term hired laborers of more than thirty years were given special care, each receiving an extra 200 bu. He himself participated in democratic education work and received a monthly salary of 120 jin of grain, plus 200 bu of land for teachers' living expenses. In his spare time, he engaged in weeding and cutting firewood. The hired laborer, Xu Jing, became his family's production mentor, and the master-slave relationship was no more. Due to the family's diligent production, after the land reform, they harvested 14 shi of soybeans, 17 shi of corn, and 6 dan of cotton, using more than 2,000 jin of corn as wages for hired laborers, and their own lives were very good. During the recent "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's troops, he still insisted on education work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Yuan Shaoqi, landlord, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and principal of the primary school in Jiehu Town, Yinan (southern part of the new Yishui County), Central Shandong, was given more than five mu of land per person in his family by the masses during the land reform. The women in his family spun thread and knitted socks, his son participated in the work of the Datian Medical Cooperative, and he himself served as a doctor in the town's medical cooperative, and invested more than 200,000 yuan in industry and commerce. The income from dividends alone was enough for the whole family's food and clothing, and their life was prosperous. Yuan graduated from Chaoyang University in Beiping, was open-minded, spared no effort in donating land to support the army, and was enthusiastic about running schools. He once donated 30 mu of land and a school building and has been elected as a county councilor by the masses. The Gao Jiabei brothers, who are landlords, cultivated more than 60 mu of land. This year, they invested 70,000 yuan in the Liyuan Factory and can distribute more than 120,000 yuan in dividends, and their lives are comfortable. Landlord Nie Yutian retained more than 30 mu of land. In June, he invested more than 10,000 yuan in the Liyuan Factory and the cooperative, distributing more than 30,000 yuan in dividends. He has quit the bad habit of smoking, is broad-minded and healthy, and his spirits are refreshed.
