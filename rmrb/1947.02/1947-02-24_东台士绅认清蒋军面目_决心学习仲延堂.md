Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st. On the 26th of last month, the Dongtai Democratic County Government convened a symposium for local gentry in a certain location. Seventy-nine representatives of gentry from various places attended, including those from remote areas such as Fu'an, Sancang, Jiaoxie, and the suburbs of Dongtai city. They braved dangers and broke through the Chiang troops' heavy blockades to arrive on schedule. The gentry members bitterly denounced the atrocities of the Chiang troops to the democratic government. Cao Zhu, a member of the Dongtai County Provisional Council, reported: During the 31 days that Sancang Town was occupied by the Chiang troops, seven innocent people were killed, twelve were injured, fifty women were raped, more than one hundred and eighty houses were burned down, and five hundred and twenty-seven *mings* of grain were looted. When Mr. Cao spoke of a twelve-year-old girl who was gang-raped by eight Chiang soldiers and is still bedridden, the entire audience gnashed their teeth and stamped their feet in anger, condemning Chiang Kai-shek's inhumanity. The disaster-stricken people of Sancang Town organized an accusation team and rushed to the meeting to make their accusations. After tearfully recounting the crimes of the Chiang troops, they unanimously shouted: "The democratic government must lead us in seeking revenge!" Lin Zhuoguan and Wang Xingbin, two gentry members from Sancang who escaped from the Chiang stronghold in Anfeng, said: "We were kidnapped by the Chiang troops when they withdrew from Sancang. We were given only two bowls of porridge a day. We finally seized the opportunity to escape back to the liberated area. It was like orphans seeing their parents." Mr. Shen Yantang, a landlord who insisted on self-defense struggle in the border area and was known for his righteousness in exterminating his relatives, reported that he personally captured his cousin Yanfu, who had joined the Chiang clique's "Homecoming Corps," and handed him over to the democratic government for legal action, as well as his entire struggle process. The entire audience raised their arms and shouted: "No compromise, no surrender to the enemies of the nation and democracy! Learn from Mr. Zhong Yantang's spirit of righteousness in exterminating his relatives!".
