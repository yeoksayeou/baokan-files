Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. The Shanghai Wenhui Bao of January 16th reported: The Chinese Labor Association, led by Zhu Xuefan, issued a statement strongly protesting the US military's rape atrocities in Beiping and the incidents of US military personnel killing and injuring Tanggu worker Luo Guangfu (December 25th) and Shanghai rickshaw driver Cheng Yongfang (New Year's Day), demanding the withdrawal of US troops. The statement pointed out that the United States had not fulfilled the Moscow Declaration of December 1945 and the resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference. The US government's one-sided military and economic aid to China has led to the continuation and expansion of the Chinese civil war over the past year. It also pointed out that the US policy towards China is to turn China into a colony. For China's own independence, the Chinese people unanimously oppose the US military's presence in China. We, representing the Chinese workers, appeal to our American worker brothers to take joint action to stop the continued implementation of the US government's wrong policies towards China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. Shanghai News: According to the Hangzhou dispatch of the Wenhui Bao on the 18th of last month: Zhejiang University students held a strike at the beginning of January to protest the atrocities of the US military in Beiping, demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops. Half a month has passed, and there is still no sign of withdrawal. Therefore, on the 18th, the student representative meeting decided to continue the strike for three days from the 19th to strengthen organization and liaison work. If necessary, all students will conduct widespread propaganda work to various agencies, factories, and shops inside and outside the school. It is said that this kind of strike will form a long-term movement, and the movement will not stop until the US military withdraws. It is also learned that the school plans to launch the "Don't Read Bad Books and Newspapers Movement" at the same time to respond to the same movement of Shanghai students.

    【新华社延安三日电】一月十六日沪文汇报载：由朱学范氏领导的中国劳动协会发表声明，对北平美军强奸暴行及塘沽工人罗光福（十二月廿五日）、上海车夫程永芳（元旦）被美军毙伤事件提出严重抗议，要求美军撤退。声明指出：美国没有履行一九四五年十二月莫斯科声明和三外长会议的决议。美政府对华片面的军事经济援助，使一年来中国内战继续并扩大。并指出：美国的对华政策是要把中国变为殖民地。为了中国自身独立，中国人民一致反对美军驻华。我们代表中国工人向美国工人兄弟呼吁，以共同行动制止美国政府对华的错误政策的继续施行。
