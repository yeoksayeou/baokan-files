　　Female Guerrilla Gao Peiying
    In the Battle of Li'erzhuang in Jining, from 8:00 AM until dark, our militia had to retreat to Wangzhuang to the south due to being outnumbered. The militia were regrouping and preparing for a counterattack when a strong woman rolled up her sleeves, holding two hand grenades, standing at the end of the line. This was Comrade Gao Peiying, the director of the Women's Association of the Fourth District.
    I asked Comrade Peiying in surprise, "Are you going to charge up there too?"
    "I just arrived, I came with the militia. We've been holding Li'erzhuang for seven or eight hours already."
    The attack began. The enemy was still firing north from Li'erzhuang. Comrade Gao Peiying was busy on the militia's skirmish line, helping the militia find terrain. Bullets passed by her, but she wasn't afraid at all and continued to advance. The machine guns fired more intensely, and the enemy began to retreat. The militia charged through Li'erzhuang. Comrade Gao Peiying, covered in sweat, with the grenade pins hanging from her fingers, went along the street to comfort the afflicted families. I was already panting and sitting on the base of the wall to rest. The enemy was in full retreat, and Comrade Gao Peiying continued to urge the militia to pursue them.
    I asked, "Peiying, can you still run?"
    "Yes!" She chased them for five or six li before returning.
    It turns out that she is not only a simple and lively women's leader, but also an outstanding guerrilla. Since the traitor troops came to Jining, she has often led the militia in fighting the enemy. (Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch)

　　女游击队员高培英
    济宁李二庄战斗，从上午八时直到天黑，我民兵因众寡不敌，才转移到南边的王庄。民兵们正在整队准备反冲锋，一个雄壮的妇女卷起袖子，提着两个手榴弹站在队尾。这是四区的妇女会主任高培英同志。
    我惊奇的问培英同志：“你也跟着冲上去吗？”
    “我刚才来，和民兵一块来的，我们已坚持李二庄七八个钟头了。”
    冲锋开始了，敌人还在李二庄向北打枪，高培英同志在民兵的散兵线上，忙来忙去的替民兵找地势，子弹在她的身边穿过，她一点也不害怕，仍然前进。机枪响得更紧了，敌人开始撤退，民兵冲过李二庄，高培英同志满头大汗，手榴弹弦挂在指头上，沿街慰问被难的家属。我已经气喘喘地坐在墙根上休息，敌人正在溃退，高培英同志还继续叫民兵追击。
    我问：“培英，你还跑得动吗？”
    “行！”她追了五六里才回来。
    原来她不但是一个朴实活泼的妇女领袖，而且是一个出色的游击队员，自从济宁来了汉奸队，她便经常领导着民兵打敌人。（冀鲁豫电）
