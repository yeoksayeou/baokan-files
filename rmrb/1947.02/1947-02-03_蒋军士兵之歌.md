Song of the Chiang Kai-shek Soldiers
    Compiled by Qi Yu
    More than a month ago, before the Chiang Kai-shek army crossed the Yellow River and occupied the Puyang and Qingfeng areas, many folk songs were popular in the Chiang Kai-shek army's Fifth Army. One of them was:
    “I’d rather go south a thousand *li*,
    Than go north a single brick,
    Vow to never cross the Yellow River,
    Vow to never enter the Taihang Mountains.”
    The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers all thought that crossing the Yellow River and entering the Taihang Mountains meant there was only a way to go, no way to return. This folk song fully revealed the Chiang Kai-shek army's war-weariness.
     Recently, there is a song:
     “One Cheng (Chen Cheng) is not as good as one Cheng (Liu Bocheng, often written as Liu Bocheng by the Chiang Kai-shek army),
     Five Lius (Liu Zhi, Liu Maoen, Liu Ruming, Liu Ruzhen, Liu Guangxin) are not as good as one Liu (Liu Bocheng).”
     This folk song also shows that the morale of the Chiang Kai-shek army is low, pessimistic about the future of the civil war, and resentful of their officers' incompetence.
     In addition, there is a rumor of the three deaths (divisions) (the Fifth Army has a total of three divisions):
     1. Killed by marching (officers ride in cars, soldiers walk on the ground).
     2. Exhausted by digging fortifications (the Chiang Kai-shek army digs fortifications whenever it occupies a place).
     3. Killed by the Eighth Route Army.
     In order to escape the fate of death, there is also a song to find a way out:
     “Zhongzheng is not upright,
     Treatment is different;
     If you want to find a way out,
     Look for Mao Zedong.”

　　蒋军士兵之歌
    齐语辑
    一个多月以前蒋军尚未过黄河占领我濮县清丰一带时，在蒋军第五军中流行着许多歌谣，其中有一首是：
    “宁肯往南走一千，
    不愿往北走一砖，
    誓死不过老黄河，
    誓死不进太行山。”
    蒋军士兵们都以为过了黄河，开进太行山，只有去的路，没有回来的路，这首歌谣充分透露了蒋军厌战的情绪。
     最近有一首是：
     “一诚（陈诚）不如一诚（刘伯承，蒋军多写作刘伯诚），
     五刘（刘峙、刘茂恩、刘汝明、刘汝珍、刘广信）不如一刘（刘伯承）。”
     这首歌谣也说明蒋军士气低落，对内战前途悲观，而怨其长官无能。
     另外还有三死（师）（第五军共有三个师）之谣：
     一、行军拖死（军官行军坐汽车士兵地下赶路）。
     二、挖工事累死（蒋军每占一地先挖工事）。
     三、让八路军打死。
     他们为了逃脱死亡的命运于是又有一首找出路的歌子：
     中正不正，
     待遇不同；
     要找出路，
     找毛泽东。”
