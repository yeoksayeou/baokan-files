Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Revisits Lieutenant General Zhou Yuying

As the sun set, I walked along the frozen path to visit Lieutenant General Zhou Yuying, commander of the Kuomintang army's 51st Division, who had laid down his arms. General Zhou Yuying was wearing a military uniform with a silver-gray leather overcoat and brown-purple leather shoes. He is seventy-one years old this year, and his white hair is visible under the wide-brimmed military hat. He spoke eloquently, from his twenty-eight years of military life to the customs and culture of his hometown, Zhucheng, Shandong, to his education as a classmate of Xue Yue in the sixth class of the Baoding Military Academy, all the way to the Northeast Army's contribution to unity and resistance against Japan in the Xi'an Incident, the 51st Division's achievements in the War of Resistance, and the experiences of Generals Zhang Xueliang and Yu Xuezhong. The focus of the conversation finally centered on the tragic fate of the "miscellaneous troops" in Chiang Kai-shek's army, which General Zhou had personally experienced for more than a decade. Zhou revealed that a large number of Chiang's secret agents had infiltrated the 51st Division (formerly the Northeast Army), and they blatantly did whatever they wanted. They carried out a series of methods such as buying off, numbing, dividing, and disintegrating the officers and soldiers of the 51st Division. Junior officers were gradually replaced by graduates of Chiang Kai-shek's military academy. Zhang Xiyao, the head of the Huangpu clique in the division and director of the political department, constantly monitored the original Northeast Army officers. Zhou said: "Zhang Xiyao and those people are not to be trifled with. If he doesn't do well, he will file a report to his superiors, and we will be unlucky. The Huangpu clique is the most popular there now. None of our 51st Division commanders and brigade commanders have Huangpu qualifications. They are all 'black officials' (meaning unlucky), and they are always worried about being replaced. We simply cannot move at all. Wang Tiehan of the 49th Division is an example. He let Huangpu officers in, and the 49th Division was said to be 'centralized,' and Wang could no longer be an official." "We fought in the War of Resistance for several years. After Japan surrendered, the 51st Division did not have the right to accept the surrender. The 'Central Army' that flew in from Yunnan and Guizhou accepted the surrender, and the puppet army Wu Hwa-wen also became the 'National Army.' These are the things that hurt us the most! Some of our guns were brought into the country during the 'September 18th' Incident. We have not added new weapons in the past ten years. Some machine guns are old, and bullets can be loaded from the muzzle. There are also many 'single-shot' rifles. We have repeatedly requested to improve the equipment, but the 'Ministry of National Defense' has repeatedly approved the words 'No stock in the warehouse, difficult to approve.' In fact, how could this be?! A fire in an armory in Shanghai destroyed who knows how many guns and ammunition!" He paused for breath and added: "The 51st Division was only recently stationed in Zaozhuang, and each company was issued a 60mm mortar; this is far behind the direct line 74th Division."

    "After the 26th Division and the Rapid Column were annihilated, we were ill-prepared and had few soldiers. We knew we couldn't win, but the higher-ups repeatedly ordered us to 'hold fast for reinforcements.' We had no choice but to hold fast. If we withdrew from Zaozhuang, we would be dismissed and executed."

    "We have to garrison many places we occupy, so our forces are dispersed; and the command is very bad. The higher-ups don't tell us the overall plan for the Lunan operation. We only know how to execute orders. The entire deployment of the 51st Division, even the location of a company, is designated by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, and we cannot change it. For example, the Pacification Headquarters wanted Li Buqing, the commander of the 114th Brigade, to take a battalion to guard the county seat, under the command of Ma Liwu, and did not want us to ask. But Ma never contacted me. The Pacification Headquarters ordered Li Yutang, the commander of the 113th Brigade, to send two battalions to guard Hancun and one battalion to guard Guoliji; even more ridiculous is that the Pacification Headquarters designated a company to guard the southwest of Hancun. Before the Yangzhuang battle started, I wanted to concentrate my forces, but the Pacification Headquarters did not allow it. How do you think we could not be annihilated!"

    新华社特派记者重访周毓英中将
    夕阳西下，我踏着冰冻的小路去访问放下武器的蒋军五十一师师长周毓英中将。周毓英师长军服，外罩着银灰色的皮大衣，穿一双棕紫色的皮鞋，他今年七十一岁了，宽沿军帽下露出花白的头发。谈锋硕健，从他的二十八年戎马生活讲到他故乡山东诸城的风俗人情，讲到他在保定军官学校六期与薛岳同窗的学历，一直讲到西安事变中东北军对团结抗日的贡献，五十一师抗战功绩以及张学良和于学忠二位将军的遭遇。话题的中心最后集中到杂牌军在蒋介石部队中的悲惨下场，这是周师长十几年来亲身体验到的。周氏透露蒋记特务大批钻进五十一师（原军），明目张胆为所欲为，他们对五十一师官兵进行一连串的收买、麻醉、分化、瓦解等手段，下级军官逐渐换上了蒋介石军校毕业学生，该师黄埔系特务头子——师政治部主任张希尧时时监视原来东北军的军官。周说：“张希尧那些人惹不得，弄得不好他向上级打一个报告，我们便倒霉。那边现在做事最吃得开的是黄埔系，我们五十一师师旅长都没有黄埔资格，都是‘黑官’（不走时运的意思），时时担心着被换掉，我们简直无法动弹一点，四九师王铁汉就是一个例子，他让黄埔军官进来，四九师说‘中央’化了，王就做不得官了。”“我们抗战好几年，日本投降后，五十一师没有受降权，让从云南、贵州飞来的‘中央军’受降，伪军吴化又也变成‘国军’了。这些最使我们伤心！我们有一部分枪械还是‘九一八’事变时带进关内来的，十几年来没添过新武器。有些机枪老了，子弹可以从枪口装进去；还有不少‘单打一’的步枪，我们屡次呈请改善装备，‘国防部’屡次批下‘库无存品，碍难照准’几个字。其实，何尝如此？！上海一个军火库失火就不知烧掉了多少枪炮弹药！”他喘一喘气补充说：“五十一师直到最近驻枣庄后，才发给每连一门六○小炮；这比起嫡系七四师相差太远了。
    “二十六师和快速纵队被歼后，我们准备差、兵员少，明知打不赢，但是上方一次又一次地限令我们‘坚守待援’，我们只好坚守，如果退出枣庄，我们就要被撤职杀头。”
    “我们占领很多地方都要兵马守，因此兵力分散；而指挥上又非常坏，我们对鲁南作战的全盘计划，上方不告诉我们，我们只知执行命令，五十一师全师部署，连一个连的位置都是徐州绥靖公署给我们指定的，我们不能变动。例如：绥靖公署要一一四旅旅长李步青带一个营守卫县城，归马励武指挥，不要我们问，而马又从来不与我联系。绥署要一一三旅旅长李玉堂派两个营守韩村，一个营守郭里集；更笑话的是绥署指定一个连守韩村西南，杨庄战斗开始前，我要集中兵力，绥署不允许，你看我们怎能不被歼灭呢！”
