Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. The Chiang Kai-shek troops occupying Haian, Suzhong, committed a shocking blood case in Nantian Township in late October last year. The details, which have only recently been passed around, are as follows: After the Chiang troops occupied Haian in early August last year, they forced the people of Nantian Township to organize "Civilian Corps" and "Patrol Teams" to protect their transportation lines, which was rejected by the local people. Therefore, one night in late October, the Chiang troops disguised themselves as the New Fourth Army, went straight to each household's door, pretending to be "guerrillas", and tricked people into opening the door. They immediately pulled out their bayonets, grabbed the person who opened the door, and stabbed them one by one. They deceived and killed 46 people in succession from house to house. Then came the so-called "gong-beating team" shouting to catch bandits. After that, Chiang troops in yellow uniforms fired a few shots as a pretense. The murderers who had disguised themselves as the New Fourth Army fled in all directions. The Chiang troops in yellow uniforms then used the pretext of "suppressing bandits" to trick more than 200 people, dividing them into three groups: one group was the cadre team, who were tied up and taken away, and their fate is still unknown; one group was the strong men's team, who were forced to wear yellow uniforms and replenish the troops; the last group was the old, young, women and children, who were forced to hand over six catties of rice per person to the general every day. Afterwards, all the fake New Fourth Army, the gong-beating team, and the Chiang troops in yellow uniforms gathered in Haian separately to share the money and goods, and feast.

    又一笔血债！
    侵占海安蒋军
    黑夜挨户杀人
    【新华社华中十二日电】侵踞苏中海安蒋军，去年十月底在附近南田乡制造惊人血案，直至最近如辗转传日，其经过如下：去年八月初，蒋军侵占海安后，即强迫附近南田乡民众组织“民团”、“巡逻队”，保护其父通线，为当地民众拒绝，蒋军乃于十月底某夜以一部伪装新四军，直奔各家门口冒充：“打游击的”，骗开门来，当场拔出刺刀，抓住开门的人，一刀一个，挨户欺骗，一连杀了四十六人。随后是所谓“打锣队”大嚷捉土匪。再后是穿黄军装的蒋军假打数枪，原先伪装新四军的杀人犯便四向逃散，穿黄军装的蒋军复假“剿匪”为名，又骗去群众二百多人，分为三群：一群是干部队，捆了带走，至今生死不明；一群是壮丁队，强迫穿起黄军装，补充部队；一是老少妇孺，迫令他们每天每人交给将军六斤米。事后所有假新四军，打锣队和穿黄军装的蒋军分头到海安集合，分钱分物，大吃大喝。
