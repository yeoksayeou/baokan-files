Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 30th, American newspapers and radio commentaries have widely commented on the US announcement of its withdrawal from the Executive Headquarters for Mediation, emphasizing that "this decision does not imply any significant change in US policy towards China, and the US determination to assist the 'Chinese people' in achieving political and economic 'stability' has not diminished in the slightest." Here, the so-called "Chinese people" is actually a euphemism for the Chiang Kai-shek government, and the "newspapers" mentioned are mostly mouthpieces of financial oligarchs. It is reported that the New York Times, which often reflects the White House's views, commented: "Anyone, whether at home or abroad, who believes that the United States will henceforth ignore Chinese affairs is making a grave mistake." The newspaper believes that the United States will always "maintain China's territorial integrity and the Open Door Policy," and yesterday's action does not change this policy. The purpose of the action is only to "make the method by which the United States implements this policy have greater flexibility." Radio commentator Davis said: "This decision does not mean that we are withdrawing from China. We have not abandoned the task of 'assisting' China, and if the facts allow, we will not even slightly change our policy of assisting in mediating the civil war and political deadlock." He continued: "American education, technology, and economic aid to China have not only not decreased, but are increasing." "The $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank is still reserved, and this loan can be issued immediately." The Washington Post, which is close to the State Department, also discussed the loan issue and stated that aid would be given to the Chiang government.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to a United Press report from Washington on the 1st, although there are reports of the withdrawal of US Marine Corps stationed in China, the Marine Corps headquarters in California stated that it still plans to send 1,000 Marines to China for rotation on Monday (i.e., February 3rd).
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 2nd: According to a United Press reporter, the United States has signed a secret agreement with the Chiang government on the use of the Qingdao naval base. According to this secret agreement, the United States and China will jointly use the Qingdao naval base in the event of war. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department denied this, but did not explain the reason.

　　美国反动报纸叫嚣
    美政府将更积极援蒋
    五万万美元对蒋贷款即将发放并拟派一千名陆战队到中国换防蒋美签订共同使用青岛秘密协定
    【新华社延安二日电】据美新闻处华盛顿三十日电：美各报及广播言论对美国宣布退出调处执行部事多所评述，咸强调谓：“此项决策并未含有美对华政策任何重大变更之性质，美国协助‘中国人民’争取政治及经济‘稳定’之决心亦未稍馁。”此处所谓“中国人民”实际是蒋介石政府之代名词，而“各报”云云，则多系金融寡头的喉舌。据悉：经常反映白宫意见的纽约时报评称：“任何人不论在国内或海外，若以为美国从此对中国之事不问不闻，则实为莫大之错误。”该报认为：美国将始终“维护中国领土主权与门户开放”，日昨之行动，对于此种政策并无变更。行动之目的，唯在于“使美国执行此种政策之方法具有更大的选择余地。”广播评论员德维斯氏称：“此项决策并非吾人退出中国之谓。吾人迄未放弃‘协助’中国之工作，如事实允许，吾人甚至亦不稍变协助调解内战及政治僵局之方针。”继又谓：“美国教育技术及经济援华非但未见减少，且在增加中。”“进出口银行之五亿贷款额现仍保留，此项贷款即可发放。”接近国务院之华盛顿邮报亦论及贷款问题，并称，对蒋政府将一援助之。”
    【新华社延安二日电】据合众社华盛顿一日电称：驻华美军陆战队虽有撤退之消息，但加利福尼亚州陆战队司令部消息称，仍拟派一千名陆战队于星期一（即二月三日）赴华换防。
    【新华社延安二日电】据合众社记者报道：美国已与蒋政府签订关于使用青岛海军基地的秘密协定。根据这一秘密协定，一旦发生战争时，美国与中国将共同使用青岛海军基地。据美联社华盛顿消息，美海军部对此加以否认，但未说明理由。
