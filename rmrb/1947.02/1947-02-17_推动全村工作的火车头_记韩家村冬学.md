　　The Locomotive Driving the Work of the Whole Village
    A Record of Hanjiacun Winter School
    Long Zhiqing
    The winter school in Hanjiacun, Second District, Pingshun, is a place for peasants to carry out their emancipation, production, and various recreational activities. The village has been running the winter school for three years, and this year it has 187 students (out of a total village population of 540). On the second day of school, the land reform policy was explained first, and a campaign to pour out grievances was launched. Han Fuli said, "My mother cooked for others and we suffered oppression along with her. The landlord dug a cellar right in our house, but we didn't dare say a word. Now, after attending winter school, my mind understands everything. To be emancipated, we must fight the landlords to the end." Han Baoze, the civil affairs director, said, "When I was a militiaman the year before last, the landlord wouldn't even lend me a quilt! We must fight to the end." Everyone became enlightened, forming a great unity of peasants for emancipation. Feudal remnants had nowhere to hide, and all the debt-ridden households were able to fill their holes. Then, it was explained in the winter school that emancipation depends on struggle, and getting rich depends on labor and production. Immediately, six livestock and fifteen people were organized to go out for transportation. Women worked from dawn till dusk, engaging in both emancipation and spinning 270 catties of cotton. Han Zhangfa, who has a limp, also spun twenty-one catties of cotton and was elected as a model for combining production with emancipation. Now, everyone has fully shifted to production. First, twelve mutual aid teams were organized in the winter school, and a village-wide plan for delivering manure was drawn up, requiring it to be completed before the twenty-fifth day of the lunar month. Han Jinke's team started the earliest and completed their plan of one thousand loads of manure in ten days, and the teams challenged each other to competitions. On February 1st, eighty-three women in the winter school summarized and reviewed the last winter's textile plan, selected eight spinning models including Yang Zhihua, and set a plan for the "March 8th" Women's Day. Old woman Guo Chounv said, "Without an army, we can't defeat Old Chiang. To promote textiles, we must expand the membership." As a result, the women's association membership increased by thirty-four. In cultural learning, those who are illiterate are divided into groups for classes. Han Yinmu, a literacy model, has already learned to write more than eighty characters, and generally everyone can write a road pass. In December, the winter school discussed supporting the army, unanimously agreeing that without the Eighth Route Army, they could not be emancipated. "Automatic donations of silver dollars ×× yuan!" was shouted repeatedly. Guo Chengjiao and Guo Fujiao were late, and when they heard it was for supporting the army, they immediately donated three hundred yuan each. Public Security Officer Han Dean said, "I used to be a shepherd. My brother went to the army. If there were no Eighth Route Army and Communist Party, we wouldn't have anything. Sacrifice and bloodshed are for us." He immediately donated 8,320 yuan. The next day, the women brought it up for discussion in class, and the fifty-year-old woman Zhang Gongjing said, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, our ancestors would not have been able to be emancipated, and I will automatically donate 150 yuan." In a short while, 3,050 yuan was collected. When the children's corps heard about supporting the army, they also automatically donated more than 400 yuan and nine books. On the fifth day, in order to give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and cadres, the winter school first divided into four groups, reviewed the shortcomings of past work in this area, and made new plans to guarantee that the land would be cultivated better than their own. On that day, twenty-one military and cadre families were invited, and the masses presented them with cakes, wine plates, and dumplings. Guo Shi, a military family member, said before finishing eating, "My brother is fighting for our own sake. Treating us with preferential treatment is wasting everyone's work." Smiling, she squeezed out two tears.

　　推动全村工作的火车头
    记韩家村冬学
    龙之庆
    平顺二区韩家村的冬学是农民进行翻身，生产及各种文娱活动的场所。该村举办冬学已有三年历史，今年学员达一百八十七名（全村共五百四十人）。开学第二天，首先讲解了土地改革政策，展开了诉苦运动，韩付丽说：“俺娘给人家做饭，咱随着受压迫，老财打地坑打到俺家里也不敢吭声，今冬上课脑筋啥也懂得了，要翻身就和地主干到底。”民事主任韩保则说：“我前年当民兵时，老财连条被子还不借哩！非干到底不成”。每个人都觉悟了。形成农民翻身大团结，封建尾巴无处可藏，窟窿户都得以填平。接着在冬学里说明翻身靠斗争，发家致富还得劳动生产，立即组织了六个牲口、十五个人出外运输，妇女起早赶黑一面闹翻身，一面抓紧纺花二百七十斤。拐子韩章法也纺了二十一斤花，当选为生产结合翻身模范。现在已全部转入生产，首先在冬学里组织起十二个互助组，订立全村送粪计划，阴历二十五日前要全部送完，韩进科组起的最早，一千担粪计划十天送完，各组并互相挑战比赛。二月一号八十三个妇女在冬学里，总结、检查去冬的纺织计划，选出杨枝花等八个纺花模范，并订出“三八”节前的计划，老太太郭丑女说：“没军队打不败老蒋，要闹纺织就得扩大会员。”结果妇救会员又增加了三十四个。文化学习上把不识字的分做小组上课，识字模范韩引木已经写会八十多个字，一般都能开路条。腊月在冬学里讨论劳军，一致认为没八路军就不能翻身，“自动大洋××元”！喊成一片，郭成交、郭付交二人来迟了，一听是拥军，立即各报三百元。公安员韩德安说：“俺过去是放羊的，哥去当兵，一天没八路军、共产党，一天就没咱。牺牲、流血为的是咱。”立即自动大洋八千三百廿元。第二天妇女上课也提出来讨论，五十岁的老太太张恭敬说：“要不是八路军咱祖辈子翻不了身，俺自动一百五十元。”一会就集了三千零五十元。儿童团听说劳军，也自动四百多元，书九本。初五优抗拥干，首先在冬学里分四组，检讨过去优抗工作的缺点，订出新计划，保证地要耕的比自己的好。是日，二十一个军干属被请来，群众送上饼、酒盘子、饺子，军属郭实没等吃完就说：“俺哥打仗是为的咱自家，优待倒浪费了大家的工。”笑眯眯的挤出二颗眼泪。
