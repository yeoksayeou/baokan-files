　　Experiences in Adjusting Cadre-Masses Relations in the New District of Xiyang
　　Last November, Xiyang held meetings of four different types of people (active, semi-awakened, backward, middle peasants) in the new district sub-districts to review the mass movement. According to the review of the meetings, the main reasons for the failure to go deeper were: first, cadres were selfish in the distribution of fruits, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses; second, cadres' work style was undemocratic, looking down on backward masses and even shielding landlords. Based on this, each district generally adopted the following practices:
　　(1) The leadership supported and took charge, developing free thinking. At first, the masses did not dare to speak, fearing retaliation from cadres. They believed that district and village cadres were of one mind, and that cadres' words and thoughts did not align. The leadership then proposed to say whatever was on their minds, guaranteeing nothing would happen. However, in the speeches, some bad guys would take advantage of the situation, instigating backward masses to unconsciously oppose cadres. As a result, some cadres resisted ideologically and wanted to suppress the masses. Some thought that being a cadre was not worth it, fearing struggle and unwilling to be cadres. At this time, the leadership continued to support the masses, letting them speak, while also mobilizing cadres, explaining the support to cadres, and controlling the intensity. When the masses had fully vented their grievances, they quickly organized a change of direction. (2) Enlightening class consciousness and recognizing the merits of cadres. After the masses had fully vented their grievances, they were guided to combine their emancipation and conduct discussions from both the good and bad aspects of cadres. At this time, except for a very few bad guys whose purpose was to defeat cadres, most upright masses aimed to transform cadres. They all felt that cadres could not sleep at night during the movement, working for their emancipation, and that cadres' bad work styles could be transformed, and they should not be dismissed. If they were dismissed, who would dare to be cadres? In this way, the masses realized that cadres were their own cadres, fundamentally different from the rulers. If cadres' work styles were not good, everyone should transform them, not struggle against them like landlords. (3) Checking feudal remnants, discovering problems, and developing the mass movement. After the relationship between cadres and the masses was resolved, it was immediately proposed to deal with the masses who had not been emancipated, combined with tracing the roots of poverty. For example, at the meeting of the four types of people in the Second District, someone immediately raised a question: In Duzhuang, someone asked whether a cooking woman in their village, who had earned thirty silver dollars, should be struggled against? After discussion, the class line was clarified, and it was unanimously agreed that the landlord should be liquidated through struggle. The silver dollars earned by the cooking woman were earned through labor and should not be struggled against. At the meeting of the four types of people in the Fourth District, feudal remnants were checked, and it was found that six households in Yitou had not been liquidated, three households in Yuzhang had not been struggled against. A middle peasant in Sijia Ping said: In the past, they were afraid of struggle and did not expose the landlord's silver dollars themselves. This time, they would definitely tell the truth when they went back and re-struggle. Six tenancy problems were discovered in Changling. In the First District, 50 out of 70 peasant association members in Beizhangcheng stored things for landlords. Now, some villages have shifted from resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses to returning fruits and struggling against feudal landlords. (4) Several experiences. 1. Because the masses have been under feudal rule for thousands of years, coupled with the undemocratic work style of cadres, the backward masses are full of anger and dare not speak. At this time, the leadership should express its attitude, explaining that the purpose is to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, so that they can talk about their inner thoughts. However, in resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, the time should not be prolonged. After the resolution, it should quickly turn to the movement. Because the resolution of the relationship between cadres and the masses is the starting point for methods in deepening the movement, not the central issue of deepening the movement; the central issue is to check feudal remnants and launch a movement against feudalism.
　　2. In resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, the awareness of cadres should be raised. For example, cadres in Huyu previously had disagreements between the government and the armed forces. After checking their work styles, the masses raised many opinions, and they all realized that they all had problems, and the divisions between cadres were also mutually forgiven. Most importantly, through this ideological movement, they fully experienced the greatness of the masses' power. For example, cadres in West Street, Huyu, all reflected: Without the masses, they simply cannot stand. They must unite with the masses in the future. The masses' awareness has also greatly improved, realizing that cadres are their own cadres, and that bad guys want to overthrow cadres, which are their own enemies.
　　3. In deepening the movement, the relationship between cadres and the masses should be resolved first. However, if the mass mobilization is still poor and villages without district cadre leadership are developed, it will form an anti-cadre movement, which will not only fail to resolve the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also strike at cadres. Therefore, Xiyang only develops in villages where the power of the masses is dominant and there is district cadre leadership. Villages with poor mass mobilization do not emphasize resolving the cadre issue first. (Xiyang Joint Office of the League)

　　昔阳新区调整干群关系经验
    昔阳于去年十一月，曾在新区分区召开不同的四种人（积极、半觉悟、落后、中农）会议，检查群众运动。根据会议的检查，形成不能深入的主要原因，一是在分配果实上，干部自私，惹起群众不满。一是干部作风不民主，看不起落后群众，甚至包庇地主。据此，各区大致采取了如下作法：
    （一）领导上撑腰作主，开展自由思想，一开始群众不敢说话，害怕干部报复。认为区村干部是一条心，干部嘴和心不碰等。领导上便提出有啥说啥，保证没事。但在发言中，有时会给一些坏家伙钻空子、挑拨落后群众不自觉的积极反干部。这样一来，有的干部思想抵触，想压制群众。有的认为当干部没下场，害怕斗争，不愿当干部。这时领导上一面继续给群众撑腰，让他们说话，一面又动员干部，给干部解释撑腰，并掌握火候。在群众发透牢骚时，赶快组织转弯。（二）启发阶级自觉，认识干部功劳。在群众牢骚发透后，引导群众结合翻身，从干部好坏两方面展开讨论。这时除极少数坏家伙，目的在于打垮干部外，大部正派群众目的就是为了改造干部。都感觉干部在运动中，黑夜睡不上，为咱翻身，干部作风不好可以改造，不应撤职，如撤职了谁还敢当干部哩。这样群众认识了干部是自己的干部，和统治者根本不同，干部作风不好大家来改造他，不应和斗争地主一样。（三）检查封建尾巴发现问题，开展群运。干部与群众关系解决后，随即提出没翻身的群众怎办，结合追穷根。如二区在四种人会上，当即有人提出问题：杜庄提出他村一个作饭老婆，赚下三十元银洋，是否该斗？经讨论明确了阶级界线，一致认为应给地主斗争清算，作饭的银洋是劳动赚下的，不应该斗。四区在四种人会上检查封建尾巴，发现冶头有六户没清算，峪掌有三户没斗争，寺家坪中农说：以前怕斗，自己不暴露地主银洋。这次回去一定说出，重新斗争。长岭发现租佃问题六件。一区北掌城七十个农会会员，有五十个给地主存放东西。现在有些村庄已由解决干部与群众关系，转上退果实向封建地主斗争。（四）几点经验。一、由于群众在几千年封建统治下，再加上干部作风不民主，所以落后群众满肚气不敢说。这时领导上应表明态度，说明目的是改善群干关系，才能谈出内心话来。但在解决干部与群众关系中，时间不要拉长，解决后，应很快转入运动。因为群干关系的解决，是深入运动中作法上的着手点，不是深入运动的中心问题；中心问题是检查封建尾巴，对准封建开展运动。
    二、在解决干部与群众关系上，提高干部觉悟。如胡峪干部在以前政权与武装闹意见，经检查作风，群众给提出好多意见，他们才都认识了自己都有毛病，干部间的隔阂，也都互相谅解了。最重要的是经过这次思想运动，充分体验了群众力量的伟大。如胡峪西大街干部都反映说：没有群众简直站不住，以后可得团结群众哩。群众觉悟也有很大提高，认识了干部是自己的干部，坏家伙想把干部打下来，这是自己的敌人。
    三、在深入运动中，首先应解决群干关系。但如果在群众发动基础尚差而没有区干部领导的村庄来开展，是会形成反干运动的，不但群干关系解决不好，而且会打击了干部。所以昔阳只是在群众力量占优势而有区干部领导的村庄开展，群众发动差的村庄，先不强调解决干部问题。（昔阳联合联公室）
