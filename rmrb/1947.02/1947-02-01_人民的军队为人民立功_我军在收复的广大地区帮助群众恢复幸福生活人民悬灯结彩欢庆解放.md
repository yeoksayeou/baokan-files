    The People's Army Performs Meritorious Service for the People
　　Our Army Helps the Masses Restore a Happy Life in the Vast Recovered Areas; The People Hang Lanterns and Streamers to Celebrate Liberation
    [Reported from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 30th] The Eighth Route Army, having recovered the two counties of Juye and Chengwu and all their vast subordinate areas, disregards battle fatigue, actively helps the masses restore a happy life, and carries out consolation and propaganda work. In nearly a month, the Eighth Company of a certain unit helped the masses grind grain six times, chop four hundred catties of grass, carry seven hundred and thirty-six loads of water, push nineteen carts of manure, and hold ten mass meetings. Another unit helped the masses carry five hundred loads of water in ten days, held twenty-four mass meetings, and wrote two thousand slogans, ensuring that they would not use a bowl of water or a piece of firewood from the masses. Every time they arrived in a village, they visited the families of people persecuted by the Chiang army, and the masses were moved to say, "The dear ones have come; we have been waiting for two or three months."
    [Reported from the JiluYu Front, this newspaper, 28th] On the 23rd, when Liu Bocheng's unit of the Eighth Route Army advanced towards Dingtao, the masses along the way welcomed their army with New Year's Eve-like celebrations. When Liu Ruzhen and Mi Wenhe, who had fled from Xitaiji in panic, passed through the city, they deceived the masses, saying, "Those three regiments (the three regiments eliminated by us at Xitaiji) are coming to defend Dingtao." Although the Chiang army had been building the city walls for more than four months and had cut down all the trees within six li of the city, our army recovered the four passes that evening. The next night, after launching a general attack, they resolved all the enemies in the city in just thirty minutes. That night, every household in the city hung lanterns and streamers to celebrate liberation. The democratic government immediately entered the city to carry out relief and consolation work. When the Chiang army occupied the city, they extorted 900 yuan in legal currency, 26 catties of grain, and 50 catties of firewood and grass from the masses per mu of land. The residents complained to the democratic government.

    人民的军队为人民立功
　　我军在收复的广大地区帮助群众恢复幸福生活人民悬灯结彩欢庆解放
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十日电】收复巨野城武两县及全部所属之广大地区的八路军，不顾作战疲劳，积极帮助群众恢复幸福的生活，并进行慰劳宣传工作。某部八连在将近一月内，共帮助群众推磨六次，铡草四百斤，担水七百三十六担，推粪十九车，召开群众大会十次。某部更在十天内帮助群众挑水五百担，召开群众大会廿四次，写标语两千条，作到保证不用群众一碗水一根柴，每到一村即向被蒋军迫害的人民家属进行慰问，群众被感动的说：“可是亲人们来了，咱们整整盼望了两三个月”。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十八日电】二十三日八路军刘伯承部向定陶挺进时，沿途群众以过年的狂欢来欢迎自己的军队。从西台集落荒而逃的刘汝珍、米文和经过该城时曾欺骗群众说：“那三个团（西台集被我消灭之三个团）过来守定陶。”蒋军虽然把城墙修筑了四个多月，砍光了城周围六里以内的树木，但当晚我军即将四关收复，次日晚发起总攻后，仅三十分钟即将城内敌人全都解决，当日夜城内户户悬灯结彩，欢庆解放。民主政府亦随即入城进行救济抚恤工作。蒋军盘据该城时，向群众每亩地勒索法币九百元，粮二十六斤，柴草五十斤，居民纷粉向民主政府诉苦。
