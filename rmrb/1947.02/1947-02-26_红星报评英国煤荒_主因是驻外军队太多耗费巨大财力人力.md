　　Red Star Newspaper Comments on British Coal Shortage
    Main Reason is Excessive Overseas Troops Consuming Huge Financial and Human Resources
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 24th] Moscow Dispatch: A commentator in Red Star Newspaper on the 22nd, discussing the British coal shortage, stated that the emergence of the British economic crisis is mainly a result of its foreign policy. British troops number 1,385,000, a large part of whom are stationed in foreign territories, becoming the root of many political conflicts and requiring huge expenditures. If the troops were demobilized, not only could this expenditure be reduced, but hundreds of thousands of soldiers could participate in industrial production, and national income could be increased by 400 million pounds.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 20th] London Dispatch: The British government released a white paper on the 21st, listing the main points of this year's production plan as increasing coal production to 200 million tons and increasing the number of miners from the current 690,000 to 730,000. The number of troops will be reduced by a quarter, to 1,087,000 by next March.

　　红星报评英国煤荒
    主因是驻外军队太多耗费巨大财力人力
    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科讯：红星报评论家二十二日论及英国煤荒称，英国经济危机之产生，主要是由于其外交政策的结果。英国军队为数达一百三十八万五千人，其中大部驻扎于外国领土中，成了许多政治冲突的根源，且需耗费巨大款项，若使军队复原，不但可减少这项支出，且可使数十万士兵能参加工业生产，并可增加国家收入达四亿英镑。
    【新华社延安二十日电】伦敦讯：英政府于二十一日公布一白皮书，列举今年生产计划要点为煤产增至二亿吨，矿工自目前之六十九万增至七十三万人。军队人数缩减四分之一，至明年三月减至一百零八万七千人。
