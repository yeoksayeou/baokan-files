    [This newspaper's front line in the Jilu豫 region, 13th dispatch] A group of Chiang Army colonel-level officers who laid down their arms in the Dingtao-Caoxian campaign have been released by us. Those released include: Pang Shaoxu, Lieutenant Colonel and Deputy Regiment Commander of the 428th Regiment, 143rd Brigade, 68th Division of the Chiang Army; Xu Wencong, Major Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion, 428th Regiment; Jin Yaoji, Lieutenant Colonel Instructor of the 63rd Regiment, 21st Brigade, 88th Division; Zhao Xiangju, Third-Class Quartermaster of the 13th Regiment of the Shandong Security Force; Wei Maolin, Third-Class Military Doctor; and Zhu Jie, Liaison Staff of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters stationed in Caoxian and other counties. Our army's forward political department specially hosted a farewell banquet at noon on the 9th of this month. Leaders of our army attended the banquet to offer their best wishes, and the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves immensely. During the banquet, Deputy Regiment Commander Pang, Instructor Jin, and Battalion Commander Xu successively spoke, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial crimes and the cruel facts of their forced participation in the civil war. In particular, when they talked about the various oppressions they had personally suffered under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of eliminating "miscellaneous troops," Pang, Xu, and others could not help but burst into tears. They all repeatedly expressed that they would definitely stand on the people's side in the future, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policy of internal war and dictatorship, and fight for China's peace, democracy, and independence. After the banquet, they left our army's station amidst farewells and cheers.
