　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: United Press reports that the British Communist Party Congress has opened in London. Participating in the conference are representatives from thirty-one foreign communist parties, including twenty from European countries. The Netherlands has three representatives, and the German Communist Party from the British occupied zone has six. Most other communist parties have sent one representative each. Italy and Albania have not sent representatives because those two countries do not have diplomatic relations with Britain. It is said that such a grand gathering is unprecedented in the history of the British Communist Party and is the largest gathering of international communist party representatives since the dissolution of the Communist International.

　　英共代表大会开幕
    其他三十一国共产党代表列席
    【新华社延安二十三日电】合众社报导，英共代表大会已在伦敦开幕，参与此次会议的尚有国外的三十一国的共产党代表，其中来自欧洲的达二十个国家，荷兰有三名代表，英占区德国共产党则有六名，其他各国共产党多各派代表一名，意大利与阿尔巴尼亚未派代表出席，因该两国与英国无外交关系，据说这样盛大的集会是英共历史上空前的，也是共产国际解放后数目最大的国际共产党代表的一次集会。
