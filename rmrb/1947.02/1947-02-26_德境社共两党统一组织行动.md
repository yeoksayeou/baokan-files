　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. Berlin dispatch: Neues Deutschland recently published the communique of the February 14th meeting between representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the Communist Party (KPD) in the British and American occupied zones. The communique points out that the domestic and international political situation in Germany is extremely serious and emphasizes the importance of German political and economic unity. The meeting believes that joint actions by the socialist parties in the German zones and the unity of the German workers' movement, regardless of the boundaries of the occupation zones, must be achieved rapidly. In order to create the preconditions for organizing a unified socialist party throughout Germany, representatives of the leading organs of the Communist Party organizations in all regions (excluding the French occupied zone) and representatives of the Socialist Unity Party agreed to organize a standing committee of the two parties and to establish a central bureau in Berlin and a liaison bureau to contact the Communist Parties in the various occupied zones.
