Introduction to the Suobao Credit Cooperative
    Xi Min, Zhi Yong

　　In the process of preparing for the establishment of the Suobao Credit Cooperative, it was first felt that the following two issues must be resolved: one is the relationship between the credit cooperative and the mixed-business cooperative; and the other is the level of loan interest rates. Otherwise, the credit cooperative would not be successful.

　　Although everyone has recognized the benefits of establishing a credit cooperative, if the credit cooperative is independent, its profits will be a bit too low, which will affect the masses' willingness to invest and deposit. To overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to appropriately adjust and support it with the profits of other businesses. Therefore, it was decided to establish a credit department within the mixed-business cooperative and treat it as part of the entire cooperative, rather than establishing it separately. In the future, when distributing dividends, it was decided to implement an overall dividend distribution method, distributing dividends on all shares based on the total income of various businesses. At the same time, in the current situation of excessively high commercial profits, in order to avoid other departments from transferring or encroaching on credit funds and causing the credit business to fail, the principle of independent credit funds was also established. In addition, because the main purpose of the credit cooperative is not to seek profit, but to provide the masses with capital in a timely manner and support their production work, its business cannot be mixed with mixed businesses and other businesses. In order to avoid mutual entanglement in the future, the method of exclusive business operations was further established.

　　Regarding the issue of loan interest rates, the results of everyone's research showed that it should be determined based on the actual profit of the borrower. Before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, if a merchant borrowed 10,000 yuan, the best business could only see a profit of one cent per yuan at most each time. Calculated with five turnovers per month, the total profit would only be 500 yuan; while if the loan was calculated at a monthly interest rate of 2.5%, the monthly interest payment would be 250 yuan, accounting for about 50% of the net profit. If it was calculated at a monthly interest rate of 3%, that would be 60% of the net profit. Therefore, before the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, a monthly interest rate exceeding 1.5% was usury. What about now? If you borrow 10,000 yuan, you can earn more than 10,000 yuan a month if you run a good business, and generally you can earn 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Even if calculated at a monthly interest rate of 5%, the monthly interest payment only accounts for less than 10% of the net profit. Therefore, even if commercial loans are slightly higher today, they cannot be called usury. As for the interest on deposits, in order to facilitate attracting deposits, in addition to the general preferential measures such as high interest rates and low minimum deposit amounts, a semi-annual settlement and compound interest system of adding interest to the principal was implemented.

　　After these issues were properly resolved, after four days of mobilization, the mixed cooperative received 679,750 yuan in new shares, plus the original capital of 230,000 yuan, the total capital of the entire cooperative reached more than 909,000 yuan. 250,000 yuan was taken out from the total capital as the independent fixed capital of the credit cooperative, and 250,000 yuan was borrowed from the South Bank at a low interest rate. It officially opened on April 1st of last year.

　　In the first three months, the credit cooperative achieved considerable success. A total of 268,500 yuan in agricultural loans was granted to 42 households (26 poor farmers and 16 middle farmers), purchasing a total of 32 pieces of agricultural equipment and 30 livestock. After obtaining agricultural equipment and livestock, in addition to helping each other cultivate land, the masses earned 262,300 yuan in transportation profits. Plus, the 30 livestock and 32 pieces of agricultural equipment can be converted into the current market price of 1,584,930 yuan. After deducting the 268,500 yuan loan, the total net profit was 1,578,430 yuan. A total of 883,000 yuan in loans were granted to small businesses (i.e., peddlers), and the profit was more than 600,000 yuan. 41 female weavers in the village borrowed 30,000 yuan and earned a profit of 20,000 yuan. 120,000 yuan was loaned to the village's textile factory to purchase weaving machines, spinning wheels and other equipment. In addition, in three months, fixed deposits of 34,650 yuan and current deposits of 29,300 yuan were absorbed. Loans combined with mass funds of 360,000 yuan to support mass production. A total profit of 2,470,858 yuan was obtained in three months, with an average profit of more than two yuan per yuan. This is more than three times higher than the 160% profit earned by the mixed cooperative in half a year before the establishment of the credit department. The only difference is that the vast majority of these profits were obtained by the borrowers themselves. Therefore, the masses said: "The credit cooperative has a great role in helping the poor, which is much better than ordinary cooperatives."

　　索堡信用合作社介绍
    西民·智勇
    索堡信用合作社在筹备的过程中，首先感到有如下两个问题必须加以解决：一个是信用合作社与混合业务合作社的关系；另一个是贷款利息的高低，否则，信用合作社是不会搞好的。
    虽然，大家都已认识到成立信用合作社的好处，但如把信用社独立起来，它的利润究竟有点太低，这就会影响群众入股和存款。要克服这一缺点，就必需由其他业务的利润来适当的调剂，予以扶植，因而便决定在混合业务合作社内成立一个信用部，把它作为整个合作社的一部分，不再单独成立。将来分红的时候，则确定实行整体分红办法，按照全部股金数目，将各种业务的收入总额平均批红。同时，在目前商业利润过高的情形下，为了避免其他部门移用或侵占信用资金，而使信用业务落空，又确定了信用资金独立的原则。另外，因为信用合作社主要的不是为了谋利，而在于及时的供给群众资本，扶助他们的生产工作，它的业务是不能够和混合业务和其他业务混淆在一起的，为了今后互相不受牵扯，就更确定了业务专营的办法。
    关于贷款利息高低的问题，大家研究的结果，认为应根据贷款者实际利润多寡来定。在抗战以前，一个商人贷款一万元，经营最好的一块钱每次顶多只能看一分利，一个月以周转五次计算，才共能盈余五百元；而贷款以月利二分半计算，一个月即需付息二百五十元，约占纯利的百分之五十，若以月利三分计算，那就是纯利的百分之六十了。所以在抗战前，月息超过分半就是高利贷。现在呢？贷款一万元，经营好了一个月可盈利一万元以上，一般亦可赚到五六千元，就按月利五分计算，每月的利息也只占纯利的不到百分之十。所以今天商业贷款纵使稍高，也是不能称为高利贷的。至于存款的利息，为了便于吸收起见，除规定了利息高及存款起码数低等一般的优待办法外，并实行了半年一结账，将利折本的复利制度。
    在这些问题得到适当解决之后，经过四天的动员，混合社就收到新入股金六十七万九千七百五十元，加上原有股本二十三万元，全社资金共达九十万九千元以上，乃从全部资金中提出二十五万元，作为信用社独立的固定资本，又从南银行低利贷到二十五万元，从去年四月一日起，正式开幕营业了。
    在最初三个月内，信合社的营业便取得不少成绩。计农业贷款二十六万八千五百元，贷给四十二户（贫农二十六户，中农十六户），共买农具三十二件，牲口三十头。群众获得农具牲口后，除互助耕地外，运输盈利二十六万二千三百元，加上三十头牲口及三十二件农具可折合目前市价一百五十八万四千九百三十元，除去二十六万八千五百元贷款，共获净利一百五十七万八千四百三十元。小本商人贷款（即担挑小贩等），共贷给三十二户货款八十八万三千元，盈利六十多万元。本村纺妇四十一户贷款三万元，盈利二万元。贷给本村纺织厂十二万，购买了织机纺车等用具。此外，三个月吸收定期存款三万四千六百五十元，活期存款二万九千三百元。又贷款结合群众资金三十六万元，扶植群众生产。总计三个月共获利二百四十七万零八百五十八元，平均每元得利二元多。较混合社未成立信用部前，半年获利百分之一百六十，要高过三倍以上。所不同的，只是这些利润的绝大部分为贷款户自己所获得罢了。因之，群众都说：“信用社对穷人的扶助作用就是大，比一般的合作社要好的多了。”
