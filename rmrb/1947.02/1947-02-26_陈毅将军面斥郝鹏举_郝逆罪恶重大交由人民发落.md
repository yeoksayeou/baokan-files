　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: Hao Pengju, the traitor who betrayed the people, was escorted to a village near Linyi on February 13th and requested to meet with Commander Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army. Commander Chen, with his consistent leniency, granted him an interview. A reporter participated in the interview, and the following is a report on the conversation:

　　Upon seeing Commander Chen, Hao Pengju said: "I am deeply sorry to the people and to the Commander. To be able to see the Commander today, I have no regrets even if I die. I wonder if the Commander can forgive me?"

　　Commander Chen smiled and said: "Please sit down and let's talk slowly." At this time, Hao was at a loss, overwhelmed with guilt and shame, and tears welled up in his eyes.

　　Commander Chen asked: "Did you go to Xuzhou and meet Chen Cheng?"

　　Hao: "I went to Xuzhou and met Chen Cheng, we only talked for two hours."

　　Chen: "Did you meet Chiang Kai-shek?"

　　Hao: "No."

　　Chen: "What did you talk about with Chen Cheng?"

　　Hao: "We talked about the war situation. Xue Yue was also present."

　　Chen: "What are Chen and Xue's opinions on the war situation?"

　　Hao: "Chen Cheng said that the Shandong campaign is the key to the success or failure of the National Army and wanted me to lead my troops to participate."

　　Chen: "Do they have confidence?"

　　Hao: "I don't think they have enough confidence, because they are adopting a steady and cautious approach. They are all afraid of having their flanks exposed and their rear lines cut off. Moreover, they have suffered too many defeats in the past six months, so they have no confidence. And they all know that even if they enter Linyi, they still cannot solve the problem."

　　Chen: "Did they want you to serve as the Commander of the Lunan Pacification Headquarters, and did you have confidence in that?"

　　Hao sighed deeply and replied: "Chen Cheng told me that the designation of the 42nd Army was just a formality because the war zones and group army designations of the National Army have been cancelled. He wanted me to use only the name of the Commander of the Lunan Pacification Zone to command in the future. I knew then that I had been fooled, that they just wanted me to let my weak and isolated troops die in Lunan. I asked for post-adjustment training, but they didn't agree, so I didn't mention it anymore."

　　Chen: "How did Chen and Xue replenish your troops?"

　　Hao sighed deeply again and replied: "On the 29th day [Note: December 19th, the third day after Hao's defection] after I returned to my unit from Xuzhou via Haizhou: 1. The troops were not allowed to enter Haizhou city; 2. I was immediately ordered to take over the defense of Baitabu and undertake the task of 'encirclement and suppression'; 3. The troops did not receive any funding, only a portion was temporarily borrowed from Duan Maolin [Note: Commander of Chiang's 57th Division, currently leading troops stationed in Haizhou], which was not enough, and the withdrawal procedures were too cumbersome. When receiving rice, it was calculated by the bag, not by the catty. In reality, each bag weighed only 130-140 catties, but it was still counted as 200 catties, so the troops couldn't get enough to eat, and there was no question of smoking or wearing shoes. Thinking back to the past year in the liberated areas, I had no worries about food and clothing, everything was satisfied, and the withdrawal procedures were simple. The treatment was better than the New Fourth Army and Eighth Route Army troops, which was a world of difference compared to the Kuomintang. Not receiving funds, I changed to receiving rice. When the People's Liberation Army approached me on February 6th when the situation arose, they immediately ordered me to lay down my weapons. I personally experienced Zhuge Liang's strategy of 'attacking the heart'."

　　Chen: "Then why did you surrender to Chiang?"

　　Hao sighed regretfully: "Because my position was unstable, and I fell for Chiang Kai-shek's political lure."

　　Chen: "You said you were tricked into surrendering to Chiang. Why did you shoot the several liaison officers I sent, and why didn't you send them all back?"

　　Hao: "This was entirely done by a few bad elements in my unit, who attempted to use this to report their merits to Chiang and Chen. This time, my mistake was that I did not strictly control my subordinates. In the days before and after surrendering to Chiang, I was very distressed, truly in a state of 'being beside myself', as the ancients said. In short, I am responsible for everything. Politically, I have reached a point of no return. I accept any punishment from the Commander."

　　Commander Chen's attitude was very gentle: "Now that you have finished stating your opinions, I can tell you a few things here: First, before June of last year, we wanted to persuade you with the principle of democratic self-consciousness to accept the army-building experience of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army and transform your old-style troops into an armed force that could truly serve the people. Unfortunately, after repeated persuasion and guidance, you could not accept it. After June of last year, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas, and his conspiracy was revealed, making a self-defense war unavoidable. I knew that there was no hope for the transformation of your troops. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram instructing me to adopt a consistent policy of leniency towards your uprising troops, that is, not to use force to forcibly transform them. In order to faithfully implement the CPC Central Committee's democratic and voluntary policy of 'welcome those who come, see off those who leave' for uprising troops, I transferred your troops from the central area of ​​the liberated area to the eastern coastal border. You know very well that it was to let you choose your own future. If we wanted to solve you by force, or to retain you, it would not be difficult at all. We were willing to let you go to the border, and after you arrived at the border, all treatments remained unchanged. The hope was to let you awaken and transform to serve the people. This meaning is very clear, very clear, and very generous, tolerant, fair, and selfless. Today, I don't think anyone in your troops can deny this."

　　Hao nodded frequently and said: "The party, government, army, and people in the liberated areas, as well as the CPC Central Committee and Commander personally, have always cared for us. This is a fact."

　　Chen: "Then why did you say after surrendering to Chiang that the CCP was monitoring you very closely, and that we had no control ability, so you were able to safely surrender to Chiang? What does this mean?"

　　Hao: "That was the Central News Agency's propaganda."

　　Chen: "I heard about the collusion between Chiang, Xue, and you around the time of the loss of Huai'an and Huaiyin last September, and I knew it very clearly. I sent people, wrote letters, and sent telegrams to repeatedly advise you not to lose your personality and betray the people. I was very worried about you and did not pursue the past. In mid-January of this year, you moved your troops south to the city of Haizhou without authorization. I knew that your conspiracy with Chiang and Xue had started again, and I immediately advised you that you should stand on the side of the people to have a way out. Surrendering to Chiang would only add another funeral object for Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. You still didn't realize it. I knew there was no hope, but I still left a message that as long as you didn't openly surrender to Chiang, I would never add a single soldier or a single soldier to you. Unexpectedly, you later sought your own death and openly betrayed the people; openly surrendering to Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the people, was of no loss to the liberated area, so we did not attach importance to your surrender to Chiang. But even at this time, I still gave you a warning in the last minute, asking your troops to quickly stay away from the civil war battlefield and not to attack the liberated area, but you just wouldn't listen and dared to participate in the frontline offensive in early February. Only then did I send troops to meet you, and I captured you in one day and one night. I will tell you clearly here that I expected you to drag your troops away, and I also expected that if you dared to bite back after dragging them away, you could be quickly arrested and punished. But I can also tell you that I did not expect that you would capture and kill the liaison officers I sent when you dragged your troops away, because I did not expect people to be so unconscionable!"

　　Hao lowered his head and stamped his feet and sighed in reply: "The matter of capturing and killing the liaison officers sent by the Commander when I was leaving was completely a beastly act. I didn't know about it, it was done by my subordinates. I couldn't control my subordinates, I deserve to die!"

　　Chen: "From your rebellion to your capture, it was only eleven days. This proves that doing democratic work requires the revolutionary spirit of self-sacrifice to serve the people. Anyone who takes shortcuts will inevitably be discredited and finally cannot escape the punishment of the people. You are a demonstration of taking shortcuts. This is the first point. It also proves that an old-style warlord army cannot undertake the great task of democratic struggle without thorough transformation. This is the second point. The facts also prove that from American imperialism to Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Xue Yue, and others, after a disastrous defeat, they turned to Hao Pengju for participation. The relationship between you is too ugly, so the power is even more corrupt, so it is vulnerable. It also proves that the power of the Chinese people lies in justice and patriotic self-defense, so it is justified and powerful. As soon as you take action, you will all fall. This is the third point. The above lessons are useful to anyone, and I am afraid they are most useful to the United States, Chiang, and you."

　　"Now that you have arrived here, everything should be handled by the people. Wherever it can be preserved and forgiven, the people will definitely be able to consider it; however, what you have done is too bad, too sorry for the people, too violated human relations, and you have betrayed the country and the nation again. The crime is too great, and it depends on whether the people can forgive you. I will immediately send someone to send you to the rear to await your fate."

　　After Commander Chen finished speaking, he ordered him to leave. Hao bowed his head and said goodbye, repeatedly saying: "I am responsible for everything. I am too sorry for the people, sorry for the CCP, and sorry for the Commander!"

　　陈毅将军面斥郝鹏举
    郝逆罪恶重大交由人民发落
    【新华社山东二十三日电】背叛人民之郝逆鹏举于二月十三日被押解于临沂附近某村，要求谒见新四军军长陈毅将军，陈军长仍以宽大态度赐予接谈。记者在旁参加，兹将谈话经过报导如下：
    郝鹏举见着陈军长即说：“万分对不起人民，对不起军长；今天能见军长一面，虽死无憾，不知军长能原谅我吗？”
    陈军长笑道：“请坐下，慢慢谈。”郝此时手足无所措，感愧交集，眼泪夺眶而出。
    陈军长问：“你到过徐州见着陈诚吗？”
    郝：“到过徐州，见着陈诚，只谈了两小时。”
    陈：“你见着蒋介石吗？”
    郝：“没有。”
    陈：“你与陈诚谈什么？”
    郝：“谈战局，薛岳亦在座。”
    陈：“陈、薛（按即指陈诚、薛岳）对战局的意见怎样？”
    郝：“陈诚说山东会战是国军成败关键，要我率部参加。”
    陈：“他们有信心吗？”
    郝：“我看他们信心是不够的，因为他们采取稳扎稳进的办法，他们均怕侧面暴露和后路被切断；且半年来失败太多，故均无信心。而且都知道，即使进了临沂，仍不能解决问题。”
    陈：“难道要你出任鲁南绥靖司令，你反有信心？”
    郝长声叹气回答：“陈诚向我说，四十二集团军番号仅系一个号召，因为国军战区及其团军番号均已取消，要我以后只用鲁南绥靖分区司令的名义指挥，我便知道上了当，不过是要我以一个孤弱部队死在鲁南。我要求后调整训，他们不答应，我不便多提。”
    陈：“陈、薛对你们部队的补充如何？”
    郝又长声叹气回答：“我二十九当天（按系一二月十九日，郝叛变后第三天）由徐州绕海州返部后：一、部队不准进驻海州城；二、立即奉命接防白塔埠，并担任“围剿”之任务；三、部队未领到经费，仅由段茂霖（按系蒋五十七师师长，现率领部队驻海州）暂借一部分，又不够用，且取款手续太烦。领取米又论包不论斤，实际每包一百三四十斤，但仍照二百斤算，所以部队吃不饱，抽烟穿鞋更谈不到。想到一年来在解放区衣食毫无顾虑，样样满足，领款手续简便，待遇比新四军、八路军部队为更好，比之国民党真是有天渊之别，领不到款改领米。我在二月六日发生情况时，人民解放军接近我，即命令迅速放下武器。诸葛亮所说攻心为上的战略，我这一回算是亲身领受。”
    陈：“那么为什么你要投蒋呢？”
    郝悔恨叹气：“由于我立场不稳，上了蒋介石政治诱惑的当。”
    陈：“你说是被骗投蒋，为何又枪杀我派去的几名联络人员，为什么不完全送回？”
    郝：“这完全是我部下少数坏分子干的，企图以此向蒋、陈报功，这次我的罪过是对部下管束不严。在投蒋前后数日内，我很痛苦，真如古人所说到了“魂不守舍”的地步。总之，一切由我负责，政治上已到了无法挽救的地步，军长给我任何处分，我都接受。”
    陈军长态度很温和：“你讲完了你的意见，我在这里可以告诉你几点：第一、去年六月以前，我们是想以民主自觉的原则说服你们，接受八路军、新四军建军经验，把你们这一支旧式部队改造成为一支真正能为人民服务的武装，无奈百般说服劝导，你们都不能接受。到了去年六月以后，蒋介石大举进攻解放区，逆谋已露，自卫战已不能避免。我知道你们部队改造已无希望，中共中央来电要我对你们的部队采取一贯的宽大政策，即不用武力强迫改造。我为忠实执行中共中央对起义部队“来者欢迎，去者欢送”的民主自愿的政策，故把你们部队由解放区中心区调到东海边境。这你很明白，是让你们自己选择自己的前途。假如要用武力解决你们，或者要保留你们，是毫不困难的，愿你开到边境、且于来到边境之后，各种待遇不变，无非希望你们觉悟，向服务人民方向转变，这个意思很清楚，很明白，而且非常大度宽容，公正无私的。今天我看你们部队任何人不能否认这一点。”
    郝频频点首说：“无论是解放区党政军民，无论是中共中央和军长个人，一贯对我们是爱护的，这是事实。”
    陈：“那么为什么你投蒋后，一说中共监视你们很严，又说我方无控制能力，故你们能安全投蒋，这是什么意思？”
    郝：“那是中央社广播的造谣。”
    陈：“到了去年九月两淮失守前后，蒋、薛与你们的勾结，我早有所闻，且知道得很清楚，我又派人又写信，又用电报屡次劝告你们，不要丧失人格，背叛人民。我对于你们更是万分忧容，不究既往。到了今年一月中，你们擅自将部队南调，开至海州城下，我知道你们与蒋、薛的密谋又起，我又立即劝告你们，应站在人民方面方有出路，投蒋不过替蒋介石增加一个独裁的殉葬品，你们仍毫不觉悟。我知道已无希望，但仍然留言只要你们不公开投蒋，我绝不以一兵一卒相加。不意你们以后竟寻死路，公开背叛人民；公开投降人民公敌蒋介石是于解放区并无什么损失，故我们并不重视你投蒋的事。但是即使到这个时候，我仍然在最后一分钟下了一道警告给你，要你们部队迅速远离内战战场，不要向解放区进攻，但你们硬不听话，敢于在二月初即参加前线进攻。我这时才派部队迎击，一昼夜即捉你过来。我在这里明白告诉你，对于你们拖走部队是料定了的，对于拖走后如敢反噬，定可迅速缉拿归案惩办，也是早料定了的。但我又可以告诉你，对于你们拖走部队时，竞捕杀我派去的联络人员，则出乎我之意料，因为我不料人之无良，竟到了这种地步！”
    郝低头顿足叹气作答：“对于临走捕杀军长派来之联络员一事，完全是禽兽行为，本人不知道，是部下干的，我不能控制部下，罪该万死！”
    陈：“从你叛变到被俘前后仅十一日，这证明了干民主事业的，需要有为人民服务的自我牺牲的革命精神，凡投机取巧，必致身败名裂，最后难逃人民的惩罚，你就是一个投机取巧的示范，这是第一。又证明了一支旧式的军阀部队不经过彻底改造，绝不能担负伟大的民主斗争任务，这是第二。又从事实上证明，从美帝国主义到蒋介石、到陈诚、薛岳等人，惨败之余转而求之于你郝鹏举去参加，你们之间的关系太丑恶了，因而力量是更腐朽了，故不堪一击；又证明了中国人民的力量之于正义和爱国自卫，故名正言顺，力量伟大，一出手你们就纷纷落马，这是第三。以上这些教训，对于任何人都有用处，恐怕对美、蒋及你作用最大。”
    “目前你既然到了此地，一切应由人民处理。凡是能够保全、能够宽恕的地方，人民定可准予考虑；不过，你作的事太坏，太对不起人民，太违犯人情，再次背叛国家民族，罪恶实在太大，要看人民是否能宽恕你。我立刻派人送你到后方去，听候发落好了。”
    陈军长谈话至此，即令退，郝俯首辞出，连呼：“一切由我负责，我太对不起人民，对不起中共、对不起军长！”
