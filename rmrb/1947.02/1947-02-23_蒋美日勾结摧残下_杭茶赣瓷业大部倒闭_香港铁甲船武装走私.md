　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: The Tianjin Dagongbao's Hangzhou correspondent reported on January 31st: Hangzhou, famous for its silk and tea, has been affected by the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek and high-interest loans, resulting in the closure of more than eighty tea firms last spring. Currently, only forty remain, and most of them are on the verge of collapse.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: A Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th reported: Jingdezhen porcelain, one of Jiangxi Province's specialties, is currently in a state of depression. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 150 porcelain kilns; currently, only 76 remain. Before the war, the annual output of porcelain reached 199,954,800 pieces; during the war, it was 3 million pieces; currently, it is only 2 million. According to business people, the reason for the decline of Jingdezhen porcelain is the influx of Japanese porcelain and American glass products, which are cheaper than Jingdezhen porcelain and difficult to compete with.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: The Chongqing Democratic Daily's Hong Kong shipping news on January 13th stated: Hong Kong has become the center of smuggling into mainland China, on a scale unprecedented. There are several newly arrived armored ships from the United States, specializing in smuggling. Participants are powerful figures from all walks of life, and it is rumored that a small number of customs patrol ships are also gradually participating in the activity.

　　蒋美日勾结摧残下
    杭茶赣瓷业大部倒闭
    香港铁甲船武装走私
    【新华社延安十九日电】上月三十一日。天津大公报杭州通讯称：素以丝茶著名的杭州，因受蒋介石发动之内战及高利贷等影响，以致去年春间共八十余家茶行，倒闭至目前仅余四十家，其中大半亦濒危境。
    【新华社延安十五日电】中央社十四日电：赣省特产之一的景德镇瓷器目前正陷于不景气状态中，抗战前瓷窑达一百五十余窑，目前仅剩七十六窑，战前年产瓷器达一亿九千九百五十四万八千件，战时为三百万件，目前则仅产二百万。据商场人士谈，景瓷衰败原因为日本瓷品及美货玻璃品充斥，价钱较景瓷低廉，难与竞争。
    【新华社延安二十日电】一月十三日渝民主报香港航讯称：香港已成为中国本部走私之中心，规模之大可称空前。海上有由美国新近运到之铁甲船若干艘，专司走私。参预者均为各界有力分子，并传少数辑私船舰，亦逐渐参预其事。
