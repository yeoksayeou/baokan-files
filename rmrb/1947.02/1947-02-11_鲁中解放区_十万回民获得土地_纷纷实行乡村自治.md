100,000 Hui People Obtain Land
Actively Implement Village Autonomy

(Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th) Over 100,000 Hui people in the Luzhong Liberated Area have obtained sufficient land in the land reform movement and are now actively implementing village autonomy. On January 5th, in the Chaizhiyu area of Yishui County, thousands of Hui people established an autonomous township. When the founding meeting was held, more than 300 Hui representatives from Yinan, Yibei, Yi County, and other places came from afar to offer their congratulations. At the meeting, they unanimously supported Chairman Mao's leadership in thoroughly liberating them and returning the land to them. On January 16th, 400 Hui people in Yicheng also gathered to establish an autonomous street government. To date, there are twenty Hui autonomous villages and two Hui autonomous townships in the rural areas of Luzhong. In addition, wherever the Hui and Han people live together, there are joint Hui-Han regimes.
