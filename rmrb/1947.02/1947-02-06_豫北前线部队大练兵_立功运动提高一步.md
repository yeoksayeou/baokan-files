    Yubei Front Troops Conduct Large-Scale Military Training
    Emulation Campaign Raises to a New Level
    [Special Dispatch] A report from the Yubei Front Press Corps: Since the victory of annihilating the enemy in the Loulou campaign last December and the great victory of annihilating the enemy at Zhao's Factory on New Year's Day this year, the main force on the Yubei Front has entered a period of rest and training. The slogan of the entire force is "Prepare for a great victory!" The "Taishan" unit is holding a hero's conference, comparing heroes, discussing experiences, thinking of ways, and formulating plans for each unit and individual to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds. The "Yantai" unit has launched a mass emulation campaign; the 203rd unit has created a "leading meeting" method for recording merits and cultivating activists, so that heroes are not buried, and old heroes cultivate new heroes. They proposed: "Those who have made contributions, add merit upon merit; those who have not made contributions, work harder to make contributions." The 205th unit wants to cultivate countless model mutual aid groups in the emulation campaign and carry out the Wang Keqin movement. Zhong Caijun, a newly liberated fighter and heavy machine gunner, is determined to learn from Wang Keqin, to patiently teach the whole platoon the disassembly and shooting of heavy machine guns, to skillfully troubleshoot, to practice field movements and to study tactics. The "Wutai" unit will apply the experience of the Sixth Column in following the mass line to the scabies treatment campaign, creating a mass movement that has achieved amazing results, with 90% recovery within ten days, greatly improving the consolidation and combat effectiveness of the troops; the closeness and unity of officers and soldiers and the active emotions have also risen to an unprecedented level. Soldiers of the original Eleventh Division who had been liberated were moved to tears and said: "I have never seen such a troop before. Leaders of the company, battalion, regiment, and brigade care for and love the soldiers so much, personally washing the soldiers' scabies and applying medicine. I also had scabies in the Kuomintang army, but no one in the班管 cared, and I still had to be assigned to public errands." All the soldiers said: "This is better than staying in a hospital, even better care than at home, and revolutionary comrades and superiors are more kind than our own parents." The "Chengdu" unit launched a heart-to-heart talk campaign, creating new experiences in consolidating the troops, and took the emulation campaign a step further in studying Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's New Year's message. The front headquarters' "Battlefield" newspaper continuously used the titles "Victory Depends on Pre-War Preparation" and "Prepare for Great Victory" to call on: (1) Seize the opportunity to strengthen education on the current situation, recognize the bright future, fight bravely and arduously, strive for greater victories, and welcome the light. (2) Combine courage and technology to conduct mass military training. (3) Combine ideological mobilization and organizational work, do a good job in mutual aid groups, and mobilize everyone to help each other and find ways to win battles. Launch a campaign to make meritorious service for the people, mobilize everyone to fight bravely and tenaciously, and strive to make the first contribution for the people. At present, a great upsurge of learning, training, and making meritorious service has been set off in the troops. On the snow-covered and ice-bound Yubei Plain, in the biting cold of the early morning, all the troops are conducting combat exercises. "Sweat more in peacetime and bleed less in wartime," and "Practice diligently in peacetime, and don't panic on the battlefield" has changed from a slogan to the thinking of the masses of soldiers.

    豫北前线部队大练兵
    立功运动提高一步
    【本报特讯】豫北前线记者团报导：豫北前线主力部队自去年腊月鹿楼歼灭战及今年元旦赵家厂歼敌大胜之后，即进入休整练兵，全线部队的口号是“准备打大胜仗”！“泰山”部队正在召开群英大会，比英雄、谈经验、想办法、订各单位及个人的杀敌立功计划。“烟台”部队展开了群众性的立功运动；二○三部队创造了记功与培养积极分子的“带头会”的办法，使得不埋没英雄，以及老英雄培养新英雄。提出：“有功者，功上加功；无功者，加油立功”。二○五部队要在立功运动中培养出无数的模范互助组，开展王克勤运动。新解放战士重机枪射手钟才均，决心要向王克勤学习，要耐心教会全排人重机枪的拆卸和射击，熟练排除故障，演习野外动作和研究战术。“五台”部队将学习六纵队走群众路线的经验，运用到治疥运动中，造成群众运动，获得惊人成绩，十天之内百分之九十痊愈，使部队巩固及战斗力的提高得到很大的进步；官兵关系的亲密与团结及活跃情绪也空前高涨。被解放过来的原整十一师士兵，被感动得流泪说：“这种部队从来没有见过，连、营、团、旅首长这样的关心爱护战士，亲自替战士洗疥擦药。我在国民党军队中也生过疥，班里也没人管，还要派公差勤务”。全体战士都说：“这比住医院好，比自己家里招呼还周到，革命同志和上级比自己的爹娘还亲切”。“成都”部队开谈心运动，创造了巩固部队的新经验，在学习毛主席朱总司令新年献词的文件中，将立功运动提高了一步。前线总指挥部“战场”报连续以“胜利要在战前准备”及“准备打大胜仗”为题，号召：（一）抓紧空隙，加强时局形势教育，认识光明前途，英勇奋斗艰苦奋斗，争取更大胜利，迎接光明。（二）将勇敢和技术相结合，进行群众性的练兵。（三）将思想动员和组织工作相结合，搞好互助组，发动大家互相帮助，大家想办法打胜仗。开展为人民立功运动，发动大家英勇顽强的打胜仗，争取为人民立第一功。现各部队掀起了学习、练兵、立功三大热潮。厚雪冰封的豫北平原，在刺骨刮耳的清晨寒气中，各部队都在进行战斗演习，“平时多流汗，战时少流血”，“平时练习勤，战场不发慌”，已从口号变成为战士群众的思想。（王敏昭）
