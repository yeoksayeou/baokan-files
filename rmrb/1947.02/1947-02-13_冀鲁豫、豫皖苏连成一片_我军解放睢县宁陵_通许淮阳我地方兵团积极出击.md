The border areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu are now connected.
    Our army liberates Suixian and Ningling.
    Our local armed forces actively strike in Tongxu and Huaiyang.
    [Report from the front lines of Longhai Railway on the 9th] The Eighth Route Army, combined with local guerrilla forces and people's armed forces south of the Longhai Railway, recovered the cities of Suixian and Ningling on the 9th. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu liberated areas are now joined. The Suixian Security Regiment was completely annihilated, and the Ningling Security Regiment fled at the first sign of trouble. The results of the battle are still being tallied. After the recovery of Suixian and Ningling, the prominent Kuomintang strongholds of Minquan and Shangqiu are now directly exposed to the iron pincers of General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army both north and south of the Longhai Railway.
    [Report from the front lines of Longhai Railway on the 11th] The Eighth Route Army's local armed forces south of the Longhai Railway are actively operating, coordinating with the large-scale counter-offensive of our army on the Longhai Railway. On January 28th, the Tongxu Brigade destroyed a military truck of the 55th Division north of Tongxu in Guipo. On February 2nd, the Huaiyang local armed forces annihilated more than 20 members of the self-defense regiment of Yecheng, east of Huaiyang, including the deputy brigade commander, and seized more than 20 long and short guns.
    [Report from the front lines of Longhai Railway on the 11th] The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Eighth Route Army recovered the five cities of Taikang, Qixian, Luyi, Zhecheng, and Bozhou in the four days from January 30th to February 2nd. A total of more than 10,000 Kuomintang troops were annihilated, including two regiments of the 16th Brigade of the 75th Division, remnants of the 30th Regiment of the New 10th Brigade of the 58th Division, two regiments and one battalion of the Kuomintang National Defense Ministry's Third Column under the puppet Zhang Lanfeng, the Henan Provincial Security Regiment, and the Luyi County Security Regiment. 2,000 were killed or wounded, and more than 8,000 were captured, including regimental commander Zhang Yongcheng and the Kuomintang Luyi County Magistrate and Security Regiment Commander Sun Jingxuan. The spoils of war included 40 cannons of various types, 400 heavy machine guns, 5,000 rifles, 500,000 rounds of ammunition, one tank, 19 trucks, 150 barrels of gasoline, and countless other items.
    [Report from the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 11th] Kuomintang officers and soldiers are weary of war, and as a result, they indulge in licentiousness and corruption, drug use, and gambling, which has caused Chiang Kai-shek's panic. In recent battles, our army seized a Kuomintang telegram with the serial number 574, dated November 1946, which stated: "It was reported that many unit commanders are indulging in lavish banquets, advocating extravagance, spending money like dirt, building magnificent private residences, with extravagant furnishings, and some even keep Japanese prostitutes, indulging in lust in their boudoirs, and committing suicide by opium, unaware of the harm. They neglect their duty to defend the country and only seek momentary pleasure, ignoring the complaints of the soldiers. At this time of crisis, even if they are on guard day and night, they are still afraid of being taken advantage of..." Although Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly telegraphed orders to prohibit his troops from war-weariness and corruption, his lower-level officers and soldiers are unwilling to be cannon fodder for his traitorous civil war and can only sink into wine and women to relieve their depression. If Chiang Kai-shek continues his dictatorial civil war, the war-weariness of his lower-level officers and soldiers will only deepen. (Attached picture)

    冀鲁豫、豫皖苏连成一片
    我军解放睢县宁陵
    通许淮阳我地方兵团积极出击
    陇海路南八路军结合当地游击兵团及人民武装于九日收复睢县、宁陵两城，冀鲁豫与豫皖苏两大解放区至此已打成一片。睢县保安团全部被歼，宁陵保安团望风逃窜，战果正清查中。睢县、宁陵两城收复后，民权、商邱两个突出的蒋军据点，已直接暴露在陇海路南北刘伯承将军所部人民解放军铁钳夹击之下。
    【本报陇海前线十一日电】陇海路南蒋军后方八路军地方兵团积极活动，配合陇海路我军大规模反击攻势。一月二十八日通许大队在通许城以北贵坡炸毁五十五师军用卡车一辆，二月二日淮阳地方兵团在淮阳以东业城镇歼灭该镇公所自卫团大队副以下二十余人，缴获长短枪二十余枝。
    【本报陇海前线十一日电】豫皖苏八路军自上月三十日至本月二日四天内收复太康、杞县、鹿邑、柘城、亳县五城，共歼蒋军七十五师十六旅两个团及一个炮兵营、五十八师新十旅三十团残部、国民党国防部第三纵队伪张岚峰部两个团一个营、及河南省保安团、鹿邑县保安团等部共万余人，计毙伤两千，俘团长张永承及蒋记鹿邑县长兼保安团长孙敬轩等八千余；缴获各种炮四十门，重机枪四百挺，步枪五千枝，子弹五十万发，坦克一辆，汽车十九辆，汽油一百五十桶，其他胜利品无算。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十一日电】蒋军官兵厌战，因而纵欲腐化，吸毒聚赌，已引起蒋介石之恐慌。我军在最近战斗中，缴获蒋军民国三十五年十一月牧书字第五七四号代电，内称：“曾奉主席蒋酉寒防一科一字一一一二号代电内开：据报告部队主官，每多恣意游筵，崇尚浮华，掷万金若尘土，私邸壮丽无伦，陈设铺张，备极奢靡；甚有私藏日妓，纵欲闺房，鸦毒自戕，罔知其害。疏忽干城之纪，徒争旦夕之娱，士兵之谤怨无闻。际兹危机四伏，纵令日夜戒备、犹惧为彼所乘………。”蒋介石虽一再电令，禁止其部队厌战腐化，但其下层不甘为其充当卖国内战炮灰，只有沉于美酒妇人，以解苦闷。蒋介石继续独裁内战，其下层官兵之厌战情绪只有日益加深。（附图片）
