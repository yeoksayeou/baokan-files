　　[Taixing News from our paper] The peasants in the suburbs of Jiaozuo City are currently manufacturing mines in large quantities day and night to blockade the enemy and prepare for spring plowing. From January 31st to February 7th, four villages including Xizhangzhuang have already made more than 300 stone mines. Every day, as soon as the sun rises, the sound of mine-making can be heard everywhere in the villages, mountain gullies, roadsides, riverbanks, hillsides, and ridges. The militiamen are monitoring the enemy and covering the mine-making. The district headquarters has also sent special personnel to the various guerrilla villages to set up short-term blasting training classes on the spot. In addition, a small repair shop has been established to specialize in manufacturing detonators and repairing militia firearms. A large number of explosives and detonators have been raised from the rear. A test planting of four mines the other day has already wounded two members of the puppet home-returning corps, including Kong Sanmao.

　　焦作市郊人民造雷保卫春耕
    【本报太行讯】焦作市郊农民刻正连夜大批造雷，封锁敌人，准备春耕。从上月三十一日起迄本月七日止，西张庄等四村已造石雷三百余个，每日太阳刚升，在各村、山沟、路边、河旁、山坡、岭上、即可到处听到叮叮当当的造雷声。民兵则监视敌人掩护造雷。区指挥部并派出专人到各游击村庄，就地开设短期爆炸训练班。又成立小修械所，专造雷管与修理民兵枪械。并向后方筹集炸药、雷管甚多。日前试埋四个，已炸伤伪还乡团孔三毛等两名。
