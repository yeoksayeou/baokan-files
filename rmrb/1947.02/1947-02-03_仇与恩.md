　　Hatred and Gratitude
    Yang Minshan
    On January 13th, the Chiang troops who invaded Yuhuangmiao (west of Jinxiang) were routed. When the Eighth Route Army followed in pursuit, they found a Chiang army bugler crying by the roadside, shouting, "Eighth Route Army! Eighth Route Army!"
    His name was Li Shiyun, eighteen years old, from Liuhe Village, Ningling, Henan. His father was seized by the Chiang army and forced to be a cook in the Fifth Regiment of the Henan Security Forces last August. He went to deliver shoes to his father, but he was also detained and forced to be a bugler. His mother was driven to hang herself because of this.
    This time, his father was wounded while following the Chiang troops to invade Yuhuangmiao, and was lying on the ground moaning. Li Shiyun thought of the Eighth Route Army, so he said to his father, "Dad, have you forgotten how the Eighth Route Army helped us and treated the common people so well when they came to our village last July? You wait here, and I will find the Eighth Route Army brothers to carry you to the hospital."
    He cried out everywhere, and finally met the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army soldiers followed him to carry his father. But when they found him, he had unfortunately died from excessive blood loss. He held the body and wailed, "Dad, it was the Central Army that took your life!"
    The Eighth Route Army bought a coffin for his father and buried him by the side of Yuhuangmiao Village, and erected a wooden sign with his father's name, age, and origin written on it. After the burial, Li Shiyun suddenly hugged an Eighth Route Army soldier and said, "I want to join the Eighth Route Army, I want revenge!"

    一月十三日，进犯玉皇庙（金乡西）的蒋军溃退了。八路军跟踪追击时，发现了一个蒋军小号兵在路边哭喊着：“八路军！八路军！”
    他叫李世运，十八岁，河南宁陵柳河村人。父亲在去年八月被蒋军抓到河南保安第五团当伙夫，他去给父亲送鞋，也被扣下强迫当了号兵，母亲因此被逼得上了吊。
    这次他父亲跟着蒋军进犯玉皇庙时受了伤，躺在地上呻吟着，李世运想起了八路军，就对他父亲说：“爹，你忘了去年七月间八路军到咱村时救济咱，对老百姓那样好吗？你在这里等着，我去找八路军大哥来抬你到医院去。”
    他到处哭叫着，终于遇到了八路军。八路军战士们就跟着去抬他的父亲。但当找到以后，不幸已因流血过多死了。他抱住尸体哭号：“爹，这是中央军要了你的命呵！”
    八路军给他父亲买了棺材，埋葬在玉皇庙村边，并且立了一个木牌，上面写着他父亲的姓名、年龄、籍贯。埋葬以后，李世运突然抱住八路军战士说：“我要参加八路军，我要报仇！”
