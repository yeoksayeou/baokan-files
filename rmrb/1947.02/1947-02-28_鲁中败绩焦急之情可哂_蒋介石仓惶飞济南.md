    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] The day after Chiang's troops of seven divisions, totaling 50,000 men, were completely annihilated in the Laiwu area of central Shandong (24th), Chiang Kai-shek fled to Jinan in panic from Nanjing. According to Reuters, "In Jinan, he met with Shandong Province Chairman General Wang Yaowu and other senior officials and military experts." Associated Press simultaneously reported, "The Ministry of National Defense announced that just ten days after occupying Linyi, news came of the Communist Party severely threatening Jinan."
