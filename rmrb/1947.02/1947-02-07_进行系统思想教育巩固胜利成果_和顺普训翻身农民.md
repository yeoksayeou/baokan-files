    Conducting Systematic Ideological Education to Consolidate Victory
    Heshun Widely Trains Emancipated Peasants
    [Report from this newspaper] Heshun County has completed land reform, and the movement in the few villages that are still dividing the spoils and continuing in-depth inspections is also nearing completion. The county party committee believes that in order to consolidate the achievements of land reform and victoriously transition to organizing for large-scale production, it is necessary to conduct a summary education, systematically and universally resolve several basic problems, and improve the ideological and political consciousness of all peasants, especially backward peasants, to finally pursue and eradicate feudal remnants. To this end, it was decided to widely train 80,000 emancipated peasants throughout the county. Led by cadres from various districts, first 14,000 people will be directly trained from the base villages, and then they will return to their villages to train all peasants. District training is conducted in three phases, each lasting five to seven days, and is expected to be completed by mid-February. Currently, the first phase of training for more than 7,000 people in each district has been completed. Training for all peasants in the county is expected to be completed before spring plowing.
