　　Taihang Holds Training Work Conference
    From the Ideological Perspective Unifying the Understanding of the Importance of Military Training
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In response to the military training call of the Jinji-Luyu Military Region, the Taihang Military Region convened a training work conference on the 2nd of this month. The training team leaders, training section chiefs of the military region, the chiefs of staff of the field corps and military sub-districts, training section leaders, training team leaders, and directors of the armed forces committees all attended; Zhao Huilou, Deputy Commander of the military region, personally presided over the discussion. The meeting held detailed discussions on issues such as the future military training plans and education plans for the troops. On the 7th, Deputy Commander Zhao made a special summary speech based on the discussions at the conference. This meeting will have a great impact on the development of the military training movement in the Taihang area. During the discussions at the meeting, everyone unanimously recognized that only by first unifying the understanding of the importance of military training ideologically, can we then talk about leaders taking action personally and guaranteeing political work, and can training workers be more actively engaged in their work. At the same time, based on the achievements of last year's military training, they have a deeper understanding of two issues: one is that the leader who grasps it tightly will have greater military training achievements; and the better the soldiers are trained, the greater the achievements in combat. For example, a certain corps has achieved great results in military training and combat in Taihang. The most important reason for this is that the responsible comrades of the corps personally went deep into the companies to arrange military training work and personally participated in leading the military training. Secondly, seize all war gaps and conduct focused, intensive education. In the case of frequent battles, the method of combining combat and military training closely while fighting and training at the same time has proven very effective. In training, launch a merit campaign for military training, seize typical cases to promote the whole, and give more praise and more rewards. Military sub-districts and corps can hold several military training model representative conferences within the possible scope; it can not only promote the movement, but also provide the leadership with more military training experience; this is also a very important part of the military training movement.

　　太行召开训练工作会议
    从思想上统一认识练兵的重要
    【本报特讯】响应晋冀鲁豫军区练兵号召，太行军区于本月二日召开训练工作会议。军区轮训队队长、训练科长、各野战兵团及各军分区参谋主任、训练股长、轮训队长、武委会主任均出席参加；军区赵辉楼副司令员亲主持讨论。会中对今后部队训练计划、教育计划等问题作了详尽的讨论。七日，赵副司令员根据大会讨论，专门作了总结发言。这次会议，对太行区练兵运动的开展有很大的作用。在会议讨论中，大家已一致的认识到：只有首先从思想上统一认识练兵的重要，然后才能谈得上首长亲自动手和政治工作上的保证，训练工作者才能更积极的去工作。同时，根据去年练兵的成绩，他们更深刻的认识到两个问题：其一就是那个首长抓得紧，那里的练兵成绩就大；兵一练得好，打起仗来成绩也就特别大。如某某军团，在太行的练兵作战成绩都很大，当中最重要的原因就是该团的负责同志亲自深入到连队里去布置练兵工作，亲自参加领导练兵的原故。其次，抓紧一切战争空隙，进行有重点的突击教育。在战斗频繁的情况下，仍一面战斗一面练兵，把战斗与练兵密切结合起来的方法收效很大。在训练中，开展练兵的立功运动，抓住典型推动全体，多表扬，多奖励。各军分区各兵团，在可能范围内可以展开几次练兵模范代表大会；它不仅能推动运动，还可提供领导上以更多的练兵经验；这也是练兵运动中很重要的环节。
