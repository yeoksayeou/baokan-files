    Gao Huid's Combat Team
    Launches Revenge Campaign
    29 Enemies Eliminated in January
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 11th] Under the battle cry of "Avenge Gao Huid," Gao Huid's Combat Team eliminated 29 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including company commanders and below, in January. Since Gao Huid's glorious sacrifice in the Humazhu blockade battle, the members of Gao Huid's Combat Team have transformed grief into strength and launched a revenge campaign for Gao Huid. At the heroes' meeting on New Year's Day, all members of the team resolutely swore: "Each person will eliminate at least one enemy." They brought into full play Gao Huid's tactic of combining sniper warfare with landmine warfare, becoming even more active than before, eliminating enemies everywhere along the Tongpu Railway and on both banks of the Fen River. The most outstanding event was the ambush at Shangjiluo Village on January 28th. On that day, a Chiang Kai-shek motorcade carrying a large quantity of foreign flour was heading north. After Gao Huid's Combat Team learned of this, Captain Wang Wentong and eleven others ambushed them in the gully north of Shangjiluo Village. When the motorcade approached, they concentrated their firepower to fire, destroying two vehicles, capturing four Chiang Kai-shek soldiers escorting the vehicles and the drivers, and seizing 200 bags of foreign flour (approximately 10,000 jin), with countless other spoils of war.

    高辉达战斗队
    掀起复仇运动
    一月歼敌二十九名
    【本报太岳十一日电】在“为高辉达复仇”的行动口号下，高辉达战斗队一月份共歼蒋军连长以下二十九名。自高辉达在胡麻阻击战中光荣牺牲后，高辉达战斗队的队员们变悲痛为力量，掀起为高辉达复仇运动。在元旦日的英雄会上，该队全体队员坚决宣誓：“最少一个人歼灭一个敌人”。他们发挥高辉达冷枪战与地雷战结合的战术，较前更为活跃，在同蒲线上和汾河两岸到处歼灭敌人。最出色的是一月二十八日上纪落村的伏击战。是日有蒋军汽车队载大批洋面北上，高辉达战斗队得悉后，队长王文通等十一人便在上纪落村北头沟内埋伏。等汽车队驶近，即集中火力射击，击毁汽车二辆，俘押车蒋军与汽车夫四人，缴洋面二百包（约万斤），其他胜利品无算。
