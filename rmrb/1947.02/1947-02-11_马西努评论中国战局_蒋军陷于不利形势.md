Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 9th. Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, commenting on the situation in China, stated: The Kuomintang has begun a massive military operation, and fierce battles are unfolding on the Lunan front. The Kuomintang is attempting to eliminate the Suyu Liberated Area and the People's Liberation Army; however, the Kuomintang army will never achieve this goal! Recalling the summer and autumn of last year, the Kuomintang also wanted to achieve this goal, but as a result, hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers were disarmed, and the People's Liberation Army seized a large number of weapons, including many American weapons. On February 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek personally inspected Xuzhou, and on the 4th, he inspected the front lines again. According to foreign reports, Chiang Kai-shek's flying around like this proves that the Kuomintang army's new offensive has encountered significant difficulties.

According to information from Chinese democrats, China's political, economic, and military situation is even more unfavorable to the Kuomintang's new offensive compared to the summer and autumn of last year. On the eve of the Kuomintang's new offensive, attempts to deceive public opinion by convening the "National Assembly" to pass a "constitution" and "reorganize the government" have failed. The plan to split the democratic alliance and weaken the CCP's power through these means has also been thwarted. The democratic forces alliance has undergone arduous tests and is even more consolidated; the Democratic League has never been as determined as it is now to oppose the reactionaries' conspiracies.

According to newspaper reports, the Kuomintang's new offensive has been in an unfavorable military situation from the start. On February 5th, immediately after the Kuomintang began its offensive in Lunan, the Central News Agency released a message stating that General Liu Bocheng personally led four columns to flank the southwestern periphery of Xuzhou; this operational posture is that the Kuomintang army is encircling from southeast to northeast of Xuzhou, and the People's Liberation Army is encircling and counter-encircling from northwest to southwest. The Kuomintang's official news agency issued this message, indicating that the Kuomintang army's offensive situation is unfavorable. At the same time, Wenhui Bao and other newspapers reported that the People's Liberation Army had captured five cities in eastern Henan in succession and launched activities along the Pinghan and Beining lines, recovering Ding County and other places.

At the time when the Kuomintang began its new offensive, the domestic military and political situation made Chinese democrats have more reason to declare that the Kuomintang's continued civil war is hopeless, which has never been as obvious as it is now.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 9th. The Chengde dispatch in Tianjin's Yishi Bao on the 31st of last month revealed the military situation in Rehe, stating that the Chiang army only occupied points and lines, and the vast rural areas were still in the hands of the CCP army. The dispatch stated: The Kuomintang government's power cannot escape the scope of points and lines. Chairman Liu Duoquan once ran to Nanjing and announced a so-called three-year plan for "building a new Rehe", stepping up the expansion and training of county security teams and provincial security regiments, but it was still powerless.

    马西努评论中国战局
    蒋军陷于不利形势
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科广播评论员马西努论中国时局称：国民党已开始巨大军事行动，鲁南战线展开激战，国民党企图消灭苏鲁解放区与人民解放军；可是，国民党军是永远不能实现这个目的的！回忆去年夏秋两季，国民党也想实现这种目的；但是结果几十万官兵被解除了武装，人民解放军缴获了大量武器，包括许多美国武器。二月二日蒋介石亲赴徐州视察，四日又到前线巡视。据外报消息，蒋介石这样飞来飞去，是证明国民党军的新进攻已遇到重大困难。
    据中国民主人士消息，中国的政治经济及军事状况与去年夏秋比较，是更加不利于国民党的新进攻了。国民党开始新进攻的前夜，想以召开“国大”通过“宪法”、“改组政府”来欺骗社会舆论的企图，已告破产了。以这些手段来分裂民主派联盟、削弱中共力量的打算，也遭到失败。民主力量联盟经过了艰苦的考验，是更加巩固了；民主同盟从未像现在这样坚决地起来反对反动派的阴谋诡计。
    据报纸消息，国民党的新进攻一开始就陷于不利的军事形势。在二月五日，即国民党在鲁南开始进攻之后，中央社公布消息，说鲁西南刘伯承将军亲率四个纵队将侧击徐州西南外围；此一作战势态，为国民党军自徐州东南而东北，人民解放军自西北而西南，一面包围，一面反包围。国民党官方通讯社发出这一消息，是说明国民党军的进攻形势是并不利的。同时，文汇报及其他报纸都载着人民解放军在豫东连克五城、在平汉、北宁沿线展开活动，收复定县等地。
    在国民党开始新进攻时，国内军事政治情况使中国民主人士更有根据声明国民党继续内战之毫无前途，任何时候都没有像现在这样明显。
    【新华社延安九日电】上月三十一日天津益世报承德通讯透露热河军事情况称：蒋军占领的只是点和线，广大农村仍在中共军手中。该通讯称：国民党政府的力量跑不出点线范围，主席刘多荃曾跑到南京一次，并公布了一个所谓“建设新热河”的三年计划，加紧扩充训练县保安队及省保安团队，但依然无能为力。
