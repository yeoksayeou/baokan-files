Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, February 12th: Our special correspondent Hai Leng reports: I met the renowned General Wang Zhen at the Lüliang Front Headquarters with the Yan'an All-Circles慰问团(Comfort Group). I was deeply moved when he warmly embraced the labor hero Wu Manyou, a testament to the close unity between the people and the People's Liberation Army. These two friends, who once fought side-by-side on the Nanniwan production front, met again on the victorious self-defense battlefield. When General Wang Zhen saw that Wu Manyou was still wearing the felt hat he had given him at the Yan'an Labor Hero Congress in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), he couldn't help but recall the grand scene of Nanniwan production in those years. He pointed to Wu Manyou's beard and said, "You are still so strong! It's been a long time, we all miss you very much!" Wu Manyou said in a cordial tone: "I not only still wear the warm hat you gave me, but I have also brought the care that the people of the border region have shown you over the years." Just as these two old friends were raising their glasses together, General Chen Geng arrived. He doesn't drink alcohol, so Wu Manyou said, "I'll drink one for our heroes!" General Chen Geng said, "Combat heroes are based on labor heroes. Without millet, we cannot win battles. You should drink more." Wu Manyou said with a smile, "Without the Eighth Route Army, the common people can't produce anything, so what kind of labor hero could I be!" At this time, Brigade Commander Zhou Xihan specially presented Wu Manyou with a Sten gun, a prize of war, for his son to use to defend the border region. Wu Manyou took it and repeatedly touched the gun body, saying, "This gun has a solution in the hands of Chinese peasants. Was this made for us by America?" At this moment, countless voices outside the window interrupted Wu Manyou's words; it turned out that they were there to see the labor hero. Wu Manyou immediately went out to shake hands and chat with everyone: "You have worked so hard to help the people of Lüliang turn over a new leaf, I want to visit you!" Many officers and soldiers asked Wu Manyou for his autograph. Everyone held hands and embraced each other; it wasn't until the waning moon hung in the mountains and the starlight resembled water that they reluctantly left. After coming out, I asked a soldier what his thoughts were, and he readily replied: "It's really an honor to be慰问(comforted) by Wu Manyou!"

    【新华社吕梁前线十二日电】本社特派记者海棱报导：记者随延安各界慰问团在吕梁前线指挥部会见了名震南北的王震将军，当他和劳动英雄吴满有热烈拥抱时，这种炽热的人民与人民解放军之间密切团结的感情，使我异常感动。这两位在南泥湾生产战线上曾经并肩作战的朋友，今天又重逢于胜利的自卫战场上。王震将军看到吴满有仍带着民国三十年延安劳动英雄大会上他送给他的那顶毡帽时，不禁回忆起当年南泥湾生产的盛大景况。他指着吴满有的胡子说：“你还是那样健壮！好久不见了，我们大家都很想你！”吴满有以亲切的口吻说：“我不仅还戴着你给我的暖帽，而且我把边区人民几年来对待你们的关怀都带来了。”当这两位老友正举杯共饮时，陈赓将军来了，他不会饮酒，吴满有就说：“我代表我们英雄干一杯！”陈赓将军说：“战斗英雄是以劳动英雄做基础的，没有小米就不能打胜仗，你应该多喝一杯。”吴满有笑眯眯的说：“没有八路军，老百姓生产都不可能，还当什么劳动英雄哩！”这时周希汉旅长特以胜利品斯登式枪赠给吴满有，给他儿子保卫边区用。吴满有接过来，反复的摸着枪身说：“这个枪背在中国农民身上就有办法了，这是美国给咱造的吗？”这时窗外无数人的声音打断了吴满有的话，原来是看劳动英雄的；吴满有立即走出与大家握手谈笑：“你们帮助吕梁老百姓翻身太辛苦了，我要去看望你们！”很多指战员请吴满有签名。大家你拉着手，他拥着肩；直到缺月衔山、星光似水时才恋恋不舍地离去。走出后，我问一个战士有何感想，他顺口而答：“能得到吴满有来慰问真是光荣！”
