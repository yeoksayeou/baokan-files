　　What newspapers are there in the Border Region?
    In our Border Region, besides the specialized small newspapers of each special district, county, district, and each army column, brigade, and regiment, there are twelve larger newspapers. Belonging to the whole Border Region, there is the "People's Daily," the organ of the Central Bureau of Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu, printed in lead, broadsheet. It is currently alternating between two and four pages every other day. The "People's Pictorial," compiled by the Political Department of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military Region, was previously a 16-open book, but is now a single sheet of 4-open size, published on the Jin-Lu-Yu front line.
