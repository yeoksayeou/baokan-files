　　Chiang Kai-shek's Forces Obstruct UNRRA Relief Efforts
    Refuse to Allow Our Representatives to Go to Shanghai or Be Stationed in Beiping
    Chiang's Planes Strafe Zhangqiu, UNRRA Vehicles Destroyed by Bombing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 20th: Huang Hua, chief of the Communist Party's press office at the Executive Headquarters, told reporters that the Kuomintang authorities have refused to allow the CCP UNRRA liaison officers to be stationed in Beiping, and have refused to allow CCP representatives to attend the meeting in Shanghai regarding the distribution of UNRRA relief supplies. UNRRA is preparing to distribute $200 million worth of supplies in China. Without the CCP's liaison work, the transportation of these supplies in the KMT and CCP areas of North China cannot proceed. It is urgently requested that representatives of the Liberated Areas Relief Association be stationed in Beiping.
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu豫, 20th] At 6:00 AM on the 19th, a Chiang Kai-shek plane flew to Zhangqiu Town, the location of the UNRRA office, and heavily bombed the UNRRA supplies intended for the liberated areas. One UNRRA vehicle carrying relief supplies (GHT10076) was hit and destroyed. This vehicle was clearly marked, but was nevertheless destroyed, which is yet another ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage of UNRRA relief efforts. Mr. Ballew, Jiang Sheng, He Qise, and Han Sen, who were escorting UNRRA relief supplies, are extremely indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of relief work and are preparing to withdraw soon.

　　蒋方阻挠联总救济工作
    拒绝我代表赴沪及驻平
    蒋机肆虐张秋联总汽车被炸毁
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据美联社北平二十日电：执行部中共方面新闻处长黄华告记者称：国民党当局拒绝中共联总联络官留驻北平，并拒绝中共代表应邀赴上海参加关于联总救济物资分配事宜的会议，联总准备在中国分配者尚有两万万美元的物资，没有中共的联络工作，此项物资在华北国共双方区域之输送工作不可能进行，迫切要求解放区救济总会的代表驻于北平。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】十九日晨六时，蒋机一架飞至联总办事处驻地张秋镇，瞄准联总救济解放区物资大肆轰炸。联总载运救济物资汽车一辆（ＧＨＴ１００７６）中弹焚毁。该车标帜显明，竟被摧毁，实为蒋方破坏联总救济工作之又一铁证。联总护送救济物资之巴列梯、蒋生、何起色、韩森等先生，对蒋方摧残救济工作极为愤慨，准备最近撤去。
