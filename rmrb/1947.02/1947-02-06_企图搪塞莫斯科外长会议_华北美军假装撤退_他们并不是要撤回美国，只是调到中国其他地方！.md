    Attempting to Deceive the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference
    North China US Troops Feign Withdrawal
    They are not withdrawing back to the United States, but are merely being transferred to other parts of China!
    [This newspaper Shanghai 4th dispatch from TASS] According to eyewitnesses who have just arrived here from North China, some of the US troops stationed in Tianjin, Tanggu, Beiping, and Shanhaiguan are currently being transported to certain unspecified destinations. Ships carrying trucks and other materials have recently departed from Tianjin. The US troops being transferred from those places in North China are taking not only their military equipment with them, but also tents, refrigerators, bed frames, and even wooden planks. This gives reason to infer that they are not being transferred back to the United States, but are merely going to some other coastal areas of China. It is rumored that the US authorities are transferring these troops to Qingdao. Well-informed sources believe that this measure by no means implies that the US authorities have decided to withdraw their troops from China, especially this partial withdrawal of US troops from the aforementioned locations. The fact is this: the US authorities believe that the execution of the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference decision to withdraw US troops stationed in China may raise questions at the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. It is generally believed that if this question is raised, the US authorities will be in an awkward position; while the partial transfer of US troops from some places in North China to other places will enable the US authorities to say that they have begun to implement the decision made in Moscow regarding the withdrawal of troops from China. Further dispatch: US military dependents continue to arrive in Beiping from the United States.

    企图搪塞莫斯科外长会议
    华北美军假装撤退
    他们并不是要撤回美国，只是调到中国其他地方！
    【本报讯】塔斯社上海四日电：据顷由华北抵此之目睹者谈称：驻天津、塘沽、北平及山海关之美军中，有若干人现正运往某些未详的目的地，载有货车等物之船舰，顷从天津启程。由华北那些地方调走的美军，不但随船带着他们的军器，且还带着帐蓬、冷却器、床架甚至木板。此事使人有理由推断，他们不是调回美国，不过是到中国沿海某些别的地方。据传美国当局是将这些军队调至青岛。消息灵通人士相信：此种措施决非暗示美国当局决定从中国撤退其军队，特别是美军从上述地点的此种部分的撤退。事实是这样：美国当局认为在即将到来的莫斯科外长会议中可能引起质问一九四五年莫斯科三外长会议决定撤退驻华美军的执行。一般认为：假如引起这个质问，美国当局会处于窘境之中；而美军从华北某些地方部分的调至其他地方，会使美国当局能说他们已着手执行在莫斯科关于自中国撤军的决定。又讯：美军眷属继续从美国抵达北平。
