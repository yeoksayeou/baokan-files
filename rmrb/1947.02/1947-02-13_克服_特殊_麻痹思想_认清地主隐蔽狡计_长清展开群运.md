    Overcome "Special" Paralysis of Thought
    Recognize the Landlord's Hidden Tricks
    Changqing Launches Mass Movement
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] Changqing overcame "special" thinking, and the land reform movement unfolded. The second, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts have all taken action, and villages such as Xiaolipu in the eighth district have carried out struggles; some villages have already passed the peak. The experience of this movement has clarified the following issues: First, in the past, we believed that this area was "special," with scattered land and little reform to be done. After several years of democratic livelihood struggles, the remaining prestige of feudal landlords, traitors, and local bullies had been swept away. However, this movement proved that Changqing is not "special" at all, and feudal forces are still strong. The reason why we previously thought it was "special" was completely subjective. The landlords' methods of concealment, such as pretending to be poor, fake sales, and dividing up the family property, confused us. The most important thing was that our leadership was paralyzed and did not go deep enough, only approaching a few village cadres and activists, and the landlords were very respectful and flattering to them, and bribed them in every way, so they felt that the landlords were nothing. Even today, the landlords' rule is still very consolidated. In Liuguanzhuang in the second district, a feudal landlord raped women, colluded with the enemy to extort the masses, and forcibly occupied civilian land, committing all kinds of heinous crimes. Due to the paralysis of the leadership, the peasants did not stand up and settle this blood debt until today. Second, the development process of the masses from unawareness to awareness: When we first arrived in the village, the masses were indifferent to "returning the land to the farmers." Even the peasants who wanted land felt, "Can other people's meat be pressed onto our bodies?" Some masses even thought it was a matter for the higher authorities. The leadership then seized on a few typical households to enlighten them, found several prominent crimes of the landlords, and carried out liquidation and complaining. The middle elements then followed suit, and the backward elements also raised many questions in the process of everyone complaining. For example, when Liuguanzhuang complained that the landlord raped and forced people to death, and Zhaizhuang complained that our branch secretary was killed by the Red Society regiment leader, the whole audience wept bitterly. At this time, the masses unanimously believed that the landlords' vast wealth was the blood and sweat of the people, and that giving the landlords a livelihood was a gift to them. The masses consciously took action. Third, the struggle method of dealing with landlords, bullies, and traitors all together. The advantage is that the meeting is lively, and the masses have high fighting spirit. Most villages in the second, seventh, and eighth districts started this way.

    克服“特殊”麻痹思想
    认清地主隐蔽狡计
    长清展开群运
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】长清克服“特殊”思想，土地改革运动展开。二、六、七、八四个区已行动起来，八区孝里铺等村均进行了斗争；有些村高潮已过。这段运动的经验，明确了以下几个问题：一、过去我们认为这个地区“特殊”，土地分散，没啥改革，经过几年来几次的民主民生斗争，封建地主汉奸恶霸的余威已扫除净尽。但在这次运动中，证明长清并不“特殊”，封建势力还大，过去之所以认为“特殊”是完全主观的。地主的隐蔽办法，假富、假卖，分家迷了我们，最主要的是我们领导上麻痹不深入，只接近几个村干积极分子，而地主对他们又唯恭唯敬，各方收买，他们对地主便感到没有啥。直到今天，地主的统治仍很巩固。二区刘官庄，封建地主强奸妇女，勾敌敲诈群众，强占民田，种种大罪恶，因领导上的麻痹农民直到今天才翻起身来，清算这笔血债。二、群众由不觉悟到觉悟的发展过程：我们开始到村，群众对“土地还家”冷淡，就是愿意要地的农民，也感觉“人家的肉能按到咱身上？”还有些群众认为是上级的事。领导上便抓紧几个典型户启发其觉悟，找到地主的几个突出罪恶，清算诉苦，中间分子便跟上来，落后分子在大家纷纷诉苦中也提出了不少问题。如刘官庄诉到地主强奸逼死人命时，翟庄诉到我们一个支部书记被红会团长杀死时，全场痛哭流涕，这时群众就一致认为地主万顷家财是人民的血汗，给地主留生活是对地主的恩赐。群众自觉行动起来。三、地主、恶霸、汉奸一锅端的斗争方式。好处是会场热烈，群众斗劲高，二、七、八区多数村是这样搞起来的。
