　　Pingshun Eight Thousand Farmers Remember the Source of Their Happiness
    Send Telegrams to Wish Chairman Mao a Long Life
    [Our Newspaper Pingshun News] Pingshun County has realized "land to the tiller," and more than 80,000 farmers have benefited from the land reform. Farmers everywhere are celebrating the Spring Festival to celebrate their liberation. The county's liberated heroes held a Lantern Festival gathering to celebrate their victory and decided to change the Lantern Festival into Pingshun People's Liberation Day. A total of ninety-six liberated heroes attended the meeting (six women). Among them were thirty-three veteran cadres who continued to be loved by the masses after the transformation of their work style, thirteen retired soldiers who shed blood in the national self-defense struggle, and sixteen new cadres and a large number of awakened hired and poor peasants. These people are all leaders supported by the masses and have played a backbone role in the struggle to eliminate feudalism. It is particularly commendable that Zhang Baoze, a liberated hero from Huiyuantou in the Third District, has consistently been active in the liberation movement. In the distribution of fruits, he did not take credit for himself or be selfish, and he gave his share of robes, etc., to the military dependents. After the hero meeting, a 5,000-person celebration meeting was held in the Chengguan Victory Hall. In order to thank Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for leading the farmers to return the land to their homes, the entire group presented a table of exquisite "beauty cups" and two pairs of ivory chopsticks to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Liberated hero Cao Genmao stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and said, "Our farmers have been oppressed for generations. Since the Communist Party implemented land reform, everyone has been liberated and has land to cultivate. We have decided to send a small gift to express our gratitude." At the meeting, a telegram was also sent to wish Chairman Mao good health and a long life.

　　平顺八万农民饮水思源
    电祝毛主席万寿无疆
    【本报平顺讯】平顺全县已实现了耕者有其田，八万余农民得到土地改革的成果，各地农民欢度春节庆贺翻身。全县翻身英雄元宵集会庆祝胜利，决定把元宵节改为平顺人民翻身节。参加会的翻身英雄共九十六名（六名妇女）。其中有三十三名老干部，在作风转变后受到群众继续爱戴，有十三位曾在民族自卫斗争中流血的荣退军人，还有十六名新干部和大批觉悟的雇贫农。这些人都是群众拥戴的领袖，在消灭封建斗争中起了骨干作用。特别值得表扬的，是三区回源头翻身英雄张宝则，在翻身运动中一贯积极，在分配果实中，毫不居功自私，并且把自己应分得的袍子等送给军属。英雄大会结束后，接着即在城关胜利堂召开五千人庆祝大会，为了感谢毛主席朱总司令领导农民土地还家，全体特献出一桌精致的美人杯，两双象牙筷给毛主席、朱总司令。翻身英雄曹根毛站在毛主席像前说：“我们农民辈辈受压迫，自从共产党实行土地改革，人人翻身有地种，我们决定送一点礼物，表表我们的心意。”会上又打电报祝毛主席身体健康，万寿无疆。
