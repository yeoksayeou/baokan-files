　　Commemorate Lenin with New Endeavors
    Aleksandrov, Head of the Propaganda Department of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
    Editor's Note: This article is a translated excerpt from Aleksandrov's report at the memorial meeting held in Moscow on January 21st, the 23rd anniversary of Lenin's death. Although a month has passed, it provides the most direct and concise introduction to the current situation of the Soviet state and party, so it is reprinted here.
          Comrades:
    Today is the 23rd anniversary of Lenin's death. This year, the Soviet Republic created by the great Lenin will be thirty years old. In these thirty years, Lenin personally guided the Soviet state for only seven years. After Lenin's death, our party has been working for twenty-three years to realize Lenin's will, consolidate and elevate the greatness of our Soviet state, establish and unite our Soviet society, and make it advance along the path charted by Lenin.
    These years have been a time of many events. The Soviet Republic has encountered many severe tests. In this short period, the Soviet people have completed the great task of fundamentally changing our country. Our party, its Leninist Central Committee, and Comrade Stalin have resolutely advanced towards the path of socialist victory, striving to ensure the consolidation and prosperity of the Soviet system. Over these years, the Bolshevik Party has proudly held high the banner of Lenin, advancing and moving further forward, displaying its glory. On the eve of the war, every worker had already felt the tangible results of his labor in building a new socialist order. It was a time of prosperity, the beginning of a prosperous life for workers and peasants, when the people had the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of socialist culture. If it had not been for the fascist bandits forcing us into war, the Soviet state would have reached new heights of prosperity, and the Soviet people would have fully enjoyed the material and cultural benefits of socialism.
    The war showed that no force could defeat the power of Soviet society. The economic foundation established under several Five-Year Plans allowed our people to immediately begin the task of rapidly restoring the economy and further peaceful construction, both during and after the war.
    The transition from war to peace raised the issue of economic construction, restoration, and further development of the national economy. The war brought enormous destruction and losses to our country. Because this war even affected the economies of those countries that never suffered enemy looting and devastation, those countries that never felt the full force of the war's tension in the first few years of the war. It is well known that countries such as Britain and the United States only launched large-scale military operations after landing in Western Europe in June 1944, after opening the second European front, that is, when it was very clear that the Soviet army could occupy the whole of Germany with its own strength without the help of its allies, and liberate the people of all European nations from the oppression of German fascism. The Soviet state, which had to strain all its strength from the first few days of the war to drive out the enemy and bear the heavy burden of the German fascist invasion, suffered particularly severe disasters in the war. Naturally, the consequences of the arduous war and the devastation of many regions of our country have now affected our country's economic situation and created many difficulties. For example, there is now a strong shortage of coal, metal, timber, building materials, and many kinds of equipment. The war has weakened agricultural productivity. This year's poor harvest in Ukraine and the western regions of the Soviet Union has caused many additional difficulties and complicated our country's food situation. Currently, the Soviet people working on a broad front are eliminating the consequences of the war and launching a struggle for the further rise of their economy.
    The first year of the new post-war Five-Year Plan has achieved great successes in the national economy. Industry has been transformed to civilian production, and the areas that suffered deeply from German occupation have been rapidly revived. In these areas, since liberation, twenty-five blast furnaces, more than a hundred open-hearth furnaces, and dozens of rolling mills have been restored. Especially in those areas destroyed by the enemy, a huge housing construction program is underway. Compared with 1945, iron production in steel factories increased by 12 percent in 1946, steel increased by 9 percent, and rolled steel increased by 13 percent. Oil increased by 12 percent, cement increased by 85 percent, tractors increased by 72 percent, and trucks increased by 38 percent. In the past year, the electricity output of power stations has also greatly increased. In 1946, compared with 1945, the textile and light industries produced more consumer goods. Cotton fabric production increased by 17 percent, wool fabric increased by 30 percent, silk fabric increased by 36 percent, and leather shoes increased by 28 percent. Overall, in 1946, civilian industrial production increased by 20 percent. Railway freight volume increased by 13 percent.
    In the past year, the Party and the Soviet government have taken many important measures to consolidate collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. The Soviet government has provided grain and various other kinds of huge assistance to collective farms affected by drought. Comrade Stalin has determined to achieve a rapid rise in agriculture. The task is to greatly increase output and obtain large harvests on Soviet fields. In this regard, the task of spring sowing, of implementing strong preparations for sowing at a high level this year, has become very important.
    The export industry and the consolidation of the Soviet trade system, as one of the most important means of increasing people's prosperity, have also become more important. The Party and the government have taken measures for post-war economic construction and the development of trade circulation. The fund of consumer goods invested in trade institutions has increased. Transitional measures have been taken to bring the high prices of goods and the low prices of rationed goods closer and closer, creating the conditions for abolishing the rationing system and establishing a single price. The government's decision to develop cooperative trade and to increase the production of consumer goods by state-owned and cooperative factories in the near future will lead to an important increase in the quantity of consumer goods on the market.
    The Soviet state, taking advantage of its planned economy, has organized the transformation of the economy to the path of peaceful development. The important significance of construction and production is now particularly great, because the earliest possible elimination of the evils of war, the restoration and development of the national economy, and the improvement of the material life of our people depend on this. This is why Lenin particularly emphasized raising labor productivity. Comrade Stalin has repeatedly pointed out that, under the current conditions, raising labor productivity and accelerating industrial development is the competition of advanced workers, advanced factories, and mines. The socialist competition of workers and staff in factories, mines, power stations, and railways, which is widely carried out throughout the country, plays an important role in the practice of this task. In order to effectively solve the complex economic tasks facing the country and achieve the goals of the Bolshevik Party, it is necessary to practice Lenin's and Stalin's instructions to continue to improve the economic management system, improve the efficiency of management institutions, and carry out the struggle against the overstaffing of institutions, against inertia, laziness, and all kinds of indolence. Soviet and economic workers should always remember Lenin's and Stalin's instructions on strictly saving every item and on the need to use all our country's resources in the most rational way.
    The arduous war is over. But our Party is called the Party of Lenin. It is precisely because, even after defeating the enemy and achieving great victory, it still teaches the people not to rest on their laurels, but to be extraordinarily vigilant. It is well known that, after the defeat of German and Japanese imperialism, new warmongers, headed by Churchill, and their British and American friends have still not ceased their activities. As our people say, a black dog can never be called a white dog. However, it should also be stated directly that the reactionaries of today have clearly overestimated their strength in the international arena and in the struggle against democracy and against the people in capitalist countries. It is not so easy for the enemies of peace to provoke new wars now. It is true that the working class in capitalist countries still underestimates its strength in the struggle for the cause of peace and in the struggle for its own rights. However, the forces of democracy and peace far outweigh the forces of reaction and warmongering. Our Soviet government and our Party, following Lenin's teachings, pursue a consistent policy aimed at establishing a solid democratic peace between all countries, so that the attempts of imperialism and the remnants of fascism to incite hatred among the peoples, to spread seeds of discord and hostility, and to prepare the basis for another war are nipped in the bud. The Soviet state can be proud of its achievements in this struggle for the peaceful life of all nations, in its struggle for the victory of the democratic order and ideals. It can be proud of its leaders who work in the field of our foreign policy in the Leninist way.
    Comrades! Twenty-three years have passed since Lenin's death. Thanks to the Leninist policy of our Party, the Soviet state has occupied the leading position among the progressive forces of modern times.
    Lenin believed that, in order to turn communism into a practical cause, the builders of the new world would need a high degree of class consciousness and culture. Therefore, Lenin attached great importance to the education of the working people. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has practiced the teachings of its mentor and has carried out great work to cultivate socialist ideas among the Soviet people, overcome the remnants of capitalist ideology among the working people, and cultivate new qualities among the builders of socialism. Socialism requires its builders—workers, peasants, and intellectuals—to have the ability to manage the country and consciously guide the economy. Therefore, it is very important for Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals to clearly understand the tasks facing them, to be able to discover and support new socialist elements in life in a timely manner, and to detect and quickly eliminate everything that drags us backward and hinders the consolidation and development of socialism. The Central Committee of our Party has taken many important measures to improve the communist education of the working people, consolidate the political work of party organizations, and raise the ideological and cultural work of the entire party to a higher level. As a result of these measures, a new upsurge of culture and art has occurred in our country, the ideological, political, and propaganda work of party organizations has been strengthened, and the entire cadre education cause is being raised to a higher level in accordance with the tradition of the fighting Bolshevik Party and in the spirit of Leninism. The formation of new socialist qualities of the people constitutes an important part of the plan to build a communist society. It requires tenacious work in destroying deeply rooted prejudices, rigid habits, and capitalist remnants that hinder socialist construction. The cultivation of these new qualities of the Soviet people and their continuous growth in cultural level means that the most complex problems can be solved correctly.
    Many such problems have occurred and are still occurring in our country's history. How thoughtful and deliberate the Party is, weighing all the advantages and disadvantages, all the opposing factors, and wisely solving these problems every time! If the Soviet Union has now become a powerful force, a force that everyone cannot ignore, our people should be grateful for the policy of our Party. If the Soviet Union has crushed its enemies in the war and is now beginning to rapidly and fully expand its economic development, the Soviet people should rightly attribute this credit to the work of the Communist Party, to the work of the Party's leaders and guiding force—the Leninist and Stalinist Central Committee. If our people have encountered many great difficulties on their road and have found a way out each time, skillfully overcoming and eliminating these difficulties, it is only because of the strict organization and discipline of our great Party, because the leadership of the Central Committee has made it possible. The success of the Bolshevik Party's policy is due to the constant guidance of Leninist doctrine and its legacy in its work.
    Our people are enthusiastically preparing for the elections of the Supreme Soviets of the Soviet Union's allied and autonomous republics, practicing the principles of Soviet democracy—democracy for the working people. Everyone now sees the unity of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in all republics of the great Soviet Union in supporting the candidates for the Supreme Soviets of allied and autonomous republics nominated by the Party and the non-Party alliance. The upcoming elections will further strengthen the unity between the Party and the working people, strengthen our Soviets, and bring all their work to a further upsurge.
    The Soviet people's trust and love for the Leninist Party have been vividly manifested in the growth of our Party. Our Party constantly absorbs the most outstanding representatives of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals who are the leading class in our society. We know that during the Patriotic War, the Party lost tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters who fought heroically against the enemy on the front lines, in the ranks of the Soviet armed forces, and sacrificed their lives for the socialist motherland. But at the same time, more and more advanced people in our country have joined the Party in an endless stream. Before the war, the Party had nearly 3.5 million formal and probationary members. Now, the number of Party members has exceeded 6 million.
    Comrades! This is a great force. Our Bolshevik Party continues to consolidate and increase its ranks. The backbone of our Party is formed by workers who permanently work in industry and advanced collective farm peasants in our country. The Party has absorbed the best representatives of the Soviet intellectuals. Now, more than 400,000 Party members have received university education, nearly 1.3 million have received secondary education, 148,000 are engineers, 24,000 are agriculturalists and other agricultural experts, nearly 40,000 are doctors, and 80,000 are teachers. A great achievement of our Party is that more than 1 million Party members are women, which means that women enjoy equal rights with men in the Soviet Union and represent a huge force in our country's political, economic, and cultural life.
    Now, which of the parties in power in the bourgeois countries can be proud of having the same prestige among the people and enjoying the same trust and love of the broad working people? Among all the ruling bourgeois parties and those parties close to them, there is not and cannot be such a party. Our advanced people have been fighting under the banner of Lenin for half a century. Among the many great powers of modern times, how many different parties have appeared, almost all of which have disappeared without a trace. Only our glorious Party has stood strong, full of strength and power, sharp and wise, all these years, and its endless victories have amazed the world!
    After Lenin's death, the core leadership of our Party was finally formed. This core leadership, in the fierce struggle against the enemies of the Party, held high the banner of Lenin, united and reunited the entire Party, the entire people around Lenin's teachings, and led them to the broad and true road of building a communist society. The core of the Bolshevik Party is the Central Committee of our Party. Its leader and the guiding force of the Party is Lenin's most outstanding student, the powerful heir to Lenin's cause, the great Comrade Stalin!

　　以新的奋斗纪念列宁
    联共中央宣传部长  亚历山大洛夫
    编者按：本文是亚历山大洛夫于一月二十一日在莫斯科举行的列宁逝世二十三周年纪念会上的报告节译。虽然已过了一个月，但对苏联的国家和党的近况，作了最直接扼要的介绍，所以特予转载。
          同志们：
    今天是列宁逝世二十三周年纪念日。在今年，伟大的列宁所缔造的苏维埃共和国将是三十岁了。在这三十年中，列宁亲自指导苏维埃国家只有七年。在列宁逝世后，我党已在二十三年来进行工作以实现列宁的遗言，巩固与提高我们苏维埃国家的伟大，建立与团结我们的苏维埃社会，使它沿着列宁所拟定的道路前进。
    这些年来，曾经是事变纷纷的年代。苏维埃共和国遇到了许多严重考验。苏维埃人民在这一短短的时间内，已完成了根本改变我们国家的伟大思想。我们的党、它的列宁主义的中央委员会以及斯大林同志，坚决地向着社会主义之胜利的途程前进，奋力保证苏维埃制度的巩固与繁荣。这些年来，布尔什维克党骄傲地高擎着列宁的旗帜前进与更向前进，发挥它的光荣。在战争前夕，每一个劳动者已感到了他建筑新的社会主义秩序的劳动所获得的确实的成果。当人民获得享受社会主义文化的成果的机会时，曾是富裕时期，工人与农民富裕生活时期的开端。如果不是法西斯匪徒强迫我们走上战争，那末，苏维埃国家将达到新的繁荣兴盛，而苏维埃人民会充分地享受到社会主义的物质与文化的福利。
    战争表明出没有什么力量能够驱退苏维埃社会的威力。在几个五年计划之下所建立的经济基础，允许我国人民还在战争时期以及在战争之后，即刻着手进行迅速恢复经济及进一步和平建设的任务。
    从战争到和平的转变，提出了经济建设、复兴与进一步发展国民经济的问题。战争带给我们国家以巨大的破坏与损失。因为，这次战争甚至影响到那些从未遭受敌军抢劫与荼毒的国家的、那些在战争头几年内从未感到战争紧张的充分力量的国家的经济。人皆周知，诸如英美等国，仅在一九四四年六月在西欧登陆之后，在开辟欧洲第二战场之后，即是当苏军没有盟国帮助亦能以其自己的力量占领整个德国，从德国法西斯压迫之下解放欧洲各族人民，当这些已经看得很清楚的时候，才发动了最大规模的军事作战。自从战争开初几天即须紧张其一切力量驱逐敌人，担负德国法西斯入侵的重担的苏维埃国家，在战争中遭受到特别严重的灾难。很自然地，艰苦战争的后果以及我国许多区域惨遭摧毁，现在影响了我们国家的经济情况并产生了许多困难。举例来说，现在已强烈感到煤炭、金属、木料、建筑物资及许多种装备的短缺。战争已减弱了农业的生产力。今年乌克兰及苏联西方区域的歉收引起了许多额外的困难，使我国的粮食情况趋于复杂了。目前，在广泛战线上工作的苏维埃人民正在消除战争后果，并展开争取其经济进一步高涨的斗争。
    战后新五年计划的第一年，已在国民经济方面达到伟大的成绩。工业已转变为民用生产，由于德国占领而受灾深重的各区已迅速地复活了。在这些区域内，自从解放以来已恢复了廿五座鼓风炉，百余座敞口炉，数十座辗铁机。特别是在那些敌人破坏的区域内正在进行巨大的建筑住宅的计划，钢铁工厂在一九四六年与一九四五年比较，铣铁产量增加了百分之十二，钢增加了百分之九，卷钢增加了百分之十三。煤油增加了百分之十二，水门汀增加了百分之八十五，拖拉机增加了百分之七十二，卡车增加了百分之三十八。在过去的一年，电站的电量亦大大增加了，一九四六年，纺织工业与轻工业和一九四五年比较，出产了更多的消费物品。棉制品产量增加了百分之十七，毛制品增加了百分之三十，丝织品增加百分之三十六，皮鞋增加百分之二十八。整个说来，一九四六年，民用工业生产品增加了百分之二十。铁路载货量增加了百分之十三。
    在过去的一年，党与苏维埃政府采取了许多重要的措施来巩固集体农庄，国家农庄与机器拖拉机站。苏联政府曾给予旱灾侵袭的集体农庄以粮食与种种的巨大援助。斯大林同志已确定在农业方面达到迅速高涨。出产量大大增加，在苏维埃田地上获得大量收获的任务。在这方面，春季播种，今年在高度水平上实行播种的强大准备工作的任务已成为很重要了。
    作为增进人民繁荣最重要手段之一的输出业与巩固苏维埃贸易制度亦更为重要了。党与政府已采取战后经济建设与发展贸易流通的措施。投入贸易机构的消费品基金已增加了。已采取过渡的措施，使高额的商品价格与低额的配给物品的价格日益接近，造成废除配给制与建立单一价格的条件。政府关于发展合作社贸易与在最近将来由国立的及合作社的工厂增加消费品生产的决定，将使市场上大批消费品的数量达到重要的增加。
    苏维埃国家利用自己的计划经济的优点，有组织地把经济转变到和平发展的道路。现在建设与生产的重要意义是特别重大，因为尽早的消除战争恶果，恢复与发展国民经济，改善我国人民的物质生活都是以此为转移。这就是列宁特别重视提高劳动生产力的原因。斯大林同志曾一再指出：在目前条件下，提高劳动生产量与加速工业发展就是先进工人、先进的工厂与矿场的竞赛，全国广泛开展着的工厂、矿场、电站、铁路当中工人职员的社会主义竞赛，在实践这一任务中起着重要的作用。为要有效地解决摆在国家面前的复杂的经济任务，达到布尔什维克党的目标，必须实践列宁与斯大林继续改进经济管理制度的指示，提高管理机构的效率，进行反对机构人员庞大，反对因循、惰性及各种各样懒惰的斗争。苏维埃的与经济的工作人员，应该经常记着列宁与斯大林关于严格节省每一件东西，及必须以最合理的方法使用我国所有一切富源的指示。
    艰苦的战争已成过去了。但是我们的党所以称为列宁的党。正是因为它甚至击败敌人，获得伟大胜利之后，还教导人民不要高枕无忧，而且应当异常警惕。人皆周知，在击败德日帝国主义之后，在现在，以邱吉尔为首的新的战争挑拨者及其英美的朋友们，依然没有停止活动。我国人民一句老话，黑狗是永不能说成白狗的。但是，也应该直截了当地指出，现在的反动派，显然是过多地估计了其在国际舞台上与在资本主义国家内反对民主与反对人民斗争中的力量。现在，和平的敌人要挑起新的战争不是那末容易的。诚然，资本主义国家内的工人阶级，依然过低估计了他们在争取和平事业的斗争中，在争取自己的权利的斗争中的力量。然而，民主与和平的力量，却远远超过了反动派与主战派的力量。我们的苏维埃政府和我们的党，遵照列宁的遗教，奉行始终一贯的政策，其目的在建立各国之间巩固的民主和平，使帝国主义与法西斯残余想煽起各族人民中间仇恨的火焰，散播不和与仇视的种子，准备另一次战争基础的种种企图在一萌芽时即将其扑灭。苏维埃国家可以以它在这一争取各民族的和平生活的斗争中，在其争取民主秩序与理想的胜利斗争中的成绩而自豪。可以以它的在我国外交政策领域中以列宁的方式进行工作的领袖们而自豪。
    同志们！在列宁逝世之后，我们的国家已前进了二十三年。苏维埃国家由于我们党的列宁政策，已占在近代的进步力量的领导地位。
    列宁相信：如要将共产主义变成实际的事业，新世界的建造者将需要高度的阶级觉悟与文化。因此，列宁很重视劳动人民的教育。苏联共产党实践了导师的遗言，已进行了巨大的工作，使苏维埃人民养成社会主义思想，克服劳动人民中间资本主义思想的残痕，在社会主义建设者中间培植起新的品质。社会主义要求其建设者——工人、农民、知识分子——并且具备管理国家，自觉地指导经济的能力。因此，苏联工人、农民、知识分子清楚了解摆在他们面前的任务，能够及时地发现与支持生活中新的社会主义因素，侦察与即速消灭一切把我们拖向后退、及妨碍社会主义巩固与发展的事物，是非常重要的。我们党的中央委员会，已采取了许多重要的措施，改进劳动人民的共产主义教育，巩固党组织的政治工作，提高整个党的思想与文化工作至更高的水准。由于这些措施的结果，在我们的国家内已发生了新的文化与艺术的高涨，党的组织之思想、政治与宣传工作已形加强，而且按照战斗的布尔什维克党的传统，按照列宁主义精神的整个干部教育的事业正提高至更高的水平。人民新的社会主义品质的形成，这构成建立共产主义社会计划的重要部分。要求在摧毁根深蒂固的偏见、僵化的习惯、妨碍社会主义建设的资本主义残痕中进行顽强的工作。苏维埃人民这些新的品质的培养，他们的文化水准之不间断的增长，意味着最复杂的问题找到正确的解决办法。
    在我国的历史中，曾经发生过而且依然发生着许许多多这种问题，党是多么深思熟虑、衡量一切利害正反双方一切对抗因素，每次都英明地解决这些问题呢！如果说现在苏联已成为一强大的力量，人人都不能不重视的力量，我国人民应该感激我们党的政策。如果说苏联已在战争中粉碎了它的敌人。现在着手迅速地全力扩展其经济发展的话，苏联人民应该正当地把这一功劳归于共产党的工作，归于党的首脑与指导力量——列宁与斯大林中央委员会的工作。如果说我们人民在他们的道路上遇到许多巨大的困难之后，每次都找到了出路，技巧地克服与清除这些困难的话，这只是因为我们伟大的党的严格的组织性与纪律性，因为有中央委员会的领导才成为可能的。布尔什维克党政策的成功，是由于在它的工作中经常不变地受到列宁学说及其遗言的指导。
    我国人民正在热情地准备苏联各盟员共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃的选举，实践苏维埃民主——为劳动人民的民主的原则。每一个人现在都看到伟大苏联的一切共和国的工人农民与知识分子支持党与非党联盟所推选的盟员共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃候选人的一致性。行将举行的选举，将使党与劳动人民之间的团结更加强固，加强我们的苏维埃并使其全部工作达到进一步的高涨。
    苏联人民对于列宁党的信任与敬爱，已在我们党的增长中生动地表现出来了，我们的党经常地吸收在我们社会中作为领导阶级之工人阶级的，农民的与知识分子的最优秀的代表。我们知道，在爱国战争中，党损失了成千成万的优秀的儿女，他们曾在前线上，在苏维埃武装部队的行列中与敌人英勇作战，并且为社会主义的祖国而牺牲了他们的生命。但在同时，我国更多的先进的人民，潮流不息地加入了党。在战前，党有将及三百五十万正式与候补党员。现在，党员已超过六百万了。
    同志们！这是一枝伟大的力量。我们的布尔什维克党在继续巩固与增加他的队伍，我们党的骨干是由永久在工业中工作的工人与我国先进的集体农庄农民所形成。党吸收了苏维埃知识分子中的最好的代表，现在，党员当中有四十万以上受过大学教育，将及一百三十万受过中级教育，十四万八千名工程师，二万四千农业家及其他农业专家，将及四万医生，八万教员。我们党的伟大的成绩是一百余万党员为妇女，这意味着在苏联妇女享受与男子同等的权利，代表着我国政治、经济与文化生活中一支巨大的力量。
    现在，在资产阶级国家内当政的政党有那些能够骄傲在人民中间有同样的威信，享受广大的劳动人民之同样的信托与敬爱呢？在一切统治的资产阶级政党及接近此种政党的那些政党中间，没有而且不能有这样的政党。我国先进的人民，已在半世纪来在列宁的旗帜之下战斗，在许多近代的大国中曾出现过多少各种各样的政党，几乎都是无影无踪地消失了。只有我们的光荣的党在这些年来，强大地具有充分力量与威力地、锐敏地与英明地屹然站立着，它的无止息的胜利使世界惊叹不已！
    在列宁逝世之后，我党的领导核心已最后形成了，这一领导核心，在反对党的敌人的激烈斗争中，高举起列宁的旗帜，在列宁的遗教周围团结与团聚了整个党、全体人民，领导他们走向建设共产主义社会的宽广而真实的道路。布尔什维克党的核心就是我们党的中央委员会。它的领袖与党的指导力量，就是列宁最卓异的学生，列宁事业之有力的继承人，伟大的斯大林同志！
