　　“Old Hou's Leg”
    A Story of Capturing Prisoners by the Xinjiang Guerrilla Unit
    Lang Qiao
    "Old Hou's Leg" - although it is a very ordinary term, it is a title of honor that is admired by everyone in the guerrilla units of Southern Shanxi. Hou Wenqing, the reconnaissance squad leader of the Xinjiang Guerrilla Unit, is as good at running around as other scouts, but why is his leg so famous? Because he has never returned empty-handed from any of his deep dives into enemy-occupied areas.
    At noon on December 12th, Old Hou appeared on the highway section of Hengshui and Dongzhen in the KMT-occupied area with three scouts. They were disguised as die-hard soldiers, with "Central"-made hand grenades hanging from their waists and rifles on their backs, walking swaggeringly from north to south. Five miles north of Hengshui Town, a group of people slowly approached them. The guerrillas' eyes were immediately drawn to this, and Old Hou excitedly and decisively instructed his companions: "Listen to my command when the time comes, don't make a fuss." The three scouts, who had just been promoted from militiamen, were doing this for the first time, but they calmed down. They continued to walk forward and could clearly see that it was a large cart with a soldier wearing a leather aviator cap sitting in the front, and a fat-headed, red-faced man and a thin, black man in plain clothes sitting in the back, as well as a farmer driving the cart. "Stop! Which unit are you from?" Old Hou first ordered the driver, then questioned the people in the cart. "Motor Vehicle Company," the man in the leather cap replied coldly, obviously wanting to put on airs. "Get down!" Old Hou said sternly, putting on a serious face. He pointed at the cart and critically said: "Has tax been paid on the cigarettes in Dongzhen?" "Comrade, these cigarettes are for personal use, there's no need to pay tax, right?" The fat-headed, red-faced man, seeing that the situation was not good, quickly stepped forward with a smile. Then he said: "If it's really not allowed, we can pay the tax in Hengshui." "No! We are from Dongzhen." "Oh! Oh! So it's... Please bear with us, brother." As he spoke, the fellow pulled out a wad of banknotes from his pocket and handed it over. "This is official business, don't try that." Old Hou refused and pointed to the road leading to the southeast, ordering the driver: "Drive the cart away." The soldier still wanted to argue, but Old Hou had already raised his gun and pointed it at his chest, shouting: "Go!" They traveled more than thirty miles and arrived safely at the guerrilla base in the evening. After that, they captured prisoners every day except for their rest day. By the sixth day (the 17th), Old Hou and several guerrillas had controlled this section of the highway, and the stubborn bandits did not dare to travel freely here. At noon on the 17th, a stubborn soldier from the Jiang County "Love the Hometown Corps" and two village assistance members encountered Old Hou's inspection here again. One of the assistants explained in a confused manner: "We are really not 'rebellious bandits', why are you arresting us?" This unreasonable insult of the word "rebellious" further angered Old Hou, so he raised his rifle butt and beat the assistant's shoulder severely. Only then did he understand, and he pleaded repeatedly: "Ah... Grandpa Bandit, spare my life! I'll go with you, I'll go with you."

　　“老侯的腿”
    新绛游击队捉俘虏故事
    朗樵
    “老侯的腿”——这虽是一个极平常的称语，但在晋南各游击队中却是人人敬慕的荣誉的称号。新绛游击队侦察班长侯文清和别的侦察员一样善于到处奔跑的，但为啥他那条腿却格外著名呢？因为他历次深入敌占区、从未空着回来的。
    十二月十二日上午，老侯带着三个侦察员出现在蒋占区横水、东镇段汽路上。他们扮成顽军，腰间挂着“中央”造的手榴弹，各背一支步枪，大模大样由北往南走。北距横水镇五里路时，远处有一伙人向他们慢慢走来。游击队员的眼睛立刻被这吸引住了，老侯兴奋果断地叮嘱同伴：“到时候听我指挥呀，你们可不要乱哗哇。”三个刚由民兵升级的侦察员是初次干这工作的也沉住了气。他们继续往前走，已经可以清楚的看出是一辆大车，前头坐着一个戴皮航空帽的军人，后面坐着一个肥头红面的和一个黑瘦穿便衣的人，还有一个赶车的老百姓，“站住！你们是那一部分？”老侯先命令车夫，接着盘问车上坐的人。“汽车连。”戴皮帽的冷冷地回答了一句，显然他想摆出官架子。“下来！”老侯摆起面孔严厉地说。并指着车上挑剔的说：“纸烟在东镇上税了吗？”同志，这烟是自己吸的，用不着上税了吧？”那个肥头红面的看见风头不好，连忙上前陪笑脸。接着又说：“一定不行这也没有什么，我们就到横水补税吧。“不行！我们是东镇的”哦！哦！原来是……请老兄受点屈吧。”那家伙说着从衣袋里抽出一叠钞票递过来。公事公办，你休要这一套。老侯一面拒绝，一面指着通往东南去的车路命令车夫道：“把车赶走。”那军人还想强辩，但老侯已把枪端起来对住他的胸口，喝道：“走！”他们走了三十多里，傍晚时，安抵游击队驻地。以后他们除了休息的那天外，每天不空的捉回俘虏。到第六天（十七日），老侯和几个游击队员就控制了这段汽路，顽匪不敢在这里自由通行。十七号中午，有一个绛县“爱乡团”的顽兵和两个治村协助员在这里又遇到老侯的盘查。一个协助员摸不着头脑似的解释：“我们真不是叛八呀，为什要抓我们呢？”这“叛”字的无理侮辱更激怒了，老侯便高举枪托痛揍这协助员的肩膀。他才明白了，就连声哀求起来：“呀……八老爷侥命吧！我跟你们走，我跟你们走。”
