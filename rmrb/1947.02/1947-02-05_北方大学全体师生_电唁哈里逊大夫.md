　　【This Newspaper News】The entire faculty and students of Northern University and its Medical College sent a telegram to Mr. Ruike of the Canadian Red Cross, expressing condolences for the death of Dr. Harrison. The original telegram is as follows:
　　Xinhua News Agency, please forward to Mr. Ruike of the Canadian Red Cross: We were shocked to read in the newspaper that Dr. Harrison of UNRRA suffered difficulties and persecution from the Chiang Kai-shek side while transporting relief supplies, leading to his unfortunate death from overwork. When Dr. Harrison first came to our border region last year, he visited Northern University and its Medical College. In addition to generously admitting that he intended to raise funds for equipment for the medical college, he also promised to personally take on teaching positions when possible. Now, his voice and appearance are still fresh in our minds, but the sad news has arrived. All faculty and students of our university, in addition to expressing our deep condolences and high respect for Dr. Harrison, warmly welcome all international friends to continue to cooperate sincerely with us!
　　Fan Wenlan, President of Northern University, and Qian Xinzhong, Dean of the Medical College, respectfully express condolences on behalf of all faculty and students.

    电唁哈里逊大夫
    【本报讯】北方大学及医学院全体师生电加拿大红十字会瑞阿克先生，吊唁哈里逊大夫之死，原电如下：
    新华社请转加拿大红十字会瑞阿克先生大鉴：阅报惊悉联总哈里逊大夫于运送救济物资途中，备遭蒋方留难迫害，以致不幸积劳病逝；哈里逊大夫去年初次到我边区时，曾至北方大学及医学院参观，除慨然自承拟为医学院广募器材设备外，并允于可能时亲任教职。今则音容未杳，恶耗传来，本校全体师生，除对哈医生致以沉痛悲悼与崇高的敬意外，并热烈欢迎一切国际友人能与我们继续精诚合作！
    北方大学校长范文澜医学院院长钱信忠率全体师生敬唁
