Chiang Kai-shek deliberately acts like a prostitute, feigning coyness, "reproaching" his American masters for not thoroughly supporting his civil war, and openly announcing "no compromise" with the CCP in order to gain more aid.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 21st: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 15th, Chiang Kai-shek, when meeting with a group of American reporters visiting China in Nanjing on the 14th, made "off-the-record informal remarks" stating that he would not compromise with the Communist Party. He urgently requested continued assistance from the U.S. government, saying: "The only way to 'end' the Chinese civil war is to restore active American support for the National Government."

Chiang Kai-shek also postured and said: "The U.S. policy statement last June, which prohibited the sale of arms to the Nationalist side and stipulated the suspension of loans to China until the establishment of a coalition government, powerfully strengthened the Communist Party and made the continuation of the civil war inevitable." He even "reproached" the U.S. government, saying that this statement "almost amounted to non-recognition of the National Government." Chiang Kai-shek "praised Marshall highly" and said that he was "currently striving to 'liberalize' the National Government, hoping to increase the 'liberal elements' participating in the government." The Associated Press dispatch also stated: "In this off-the-record conversation, American officials in Nanjing also expressed the same views as Chiang." After the publication of this conversation, Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda minister, Peng Xuepei, suddenly issued a statement at midnight on the 17th, making a "serious correction," admitting that Chiang Kai-shek had expressed his "unwillingness to make public his opinion that calling for the Chinese organization of a coalition government including the Communist Party as a condition for selling arms and providing loans would make the CCP's attitude even more rigid and refuse to negotiate with the government." Peng Xuepei denied that Chiang Kai-shek had "reproached the United States for prolonging the Chinese civil war." Peng Xuepei also said: "The Associated Press reported that Chiang Kai-shek 'sternly refused to accept documents submitted by CCP political leaders.' This is thought to refer to the CCP's so-called denial of treaties signed by the government. At the time, the government officials in charge of receiving and sending documents believed that it was absurd and outrageous for a political party to deny the government's foreign treaties, so they returned the documents."

The Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: Chiang Kai-shek tore up the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, convened the fake National Assembly, created the fake constitution, and launched and carried out a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas. These are all universally known facts, demonstrating his determination to "never rest in peace until the Communist Party is eliminated." Now, he openly announced to American reporters that he "will never compromise with the Communist Party," his purpose being nothing more than to act tough in front of his American masters like Vandenberg, so as to solicit more assistance from the American reactionaries. At the same time, it also exposes his desperation when his resources are exhausted and his embarrassment is revealed; he has encountered serious crises in politics, economics, and military affairs. Now American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are truly united and wearing the same pants. "American officials also expressed the same views as Chiang," which is of course not surprising. The New York Times openly wrote: "The Chinese problem is also the American problem." Gu Weijun said: "China's financial and economic affairs are naturally of concern to the United States." Chiang and the United States are completely integrated, Chiang Kai-shek sells out the country wantonly, and American imperialism can also take advantage of the fire and loot wantonly. As for Chiang Kai-shek's "mild criticism" of his masters, that is just a prostitute's coquetry. He dislikes the fact that American imperialism's aggression against China and its assistance to Chiang Kai-shek in strangling the CCP and all Chinese democrats are not thorough enough. This fully exposes Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous heart, which is ten thousand times more vicious than Qin Hui. After his conversation was published, he then instructed his propaganda minister Peng Xuepei to come forward to "correct" it, denying that he had ever "reproached" the United States, which further revealed his obsequious slave-like appearance.

　　蒋介石故作娼妓撒娇
    “责备”美国主子支持他内战不彻底，公然宣布对中共“决不妥协”，以博取更多援助。        
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据美联社上海十五日电称：蒋介石于十四日接见南京美国访华记者团时，发表“不许记录之非正式谈话”称，他不会和共产党妥协。并迫切要求美政府继续援助说：“唯一‘结束’中国内战的办法，是恢复美国对国民政府之积极支持。”
    蒋介石又装腔作势说：“禁止向国方售卖军火，并规定在联合政府成立之前停止交付对华贷款之去年六月美国政策声明，有力地加强了共产党，并使内战之延续变为不可避免。”甚至“责备”美国政府这种声明“几乎等于不承认国民政府”。蒋介石“盛赞马歇尔”，并称“刻正努力使国民政府‘自由主义’化，希望参加政府之‘自由主义成份’增加”。美联社电讯又称：“在此一不许记录之谈话中，南京美方官员也表示和蒋氏相同之观点。”此项谈话发表后，蒋介石的宣传部长彭学沛忽于十七日午夜发表谈话，作“严正之更正”，承认蒋介石曾发表其“不愿公开之意见，谓公叫评论使中国组织包含共产党之联合政府为售卖军火供给贷款之条件，则使中共态度更变强硬，而拒绝与政府作任何谈判。”否认蒋介石“曾责备美国延长中国内战”。彭学沛又说：联合社所传蒋介石“严厉拒绝收受中共政治领袖所提之文件，此想是系指中共所谓否认政府所订条约之文件，当时政府主管收发人员认为以一政党而否认政府对外条约、殊嫌怪诞不经，故将文件退还。”
    新华社记者对此评称：蒋介石一手撕毁了停战令与政协决议，召开了伪国大，制造了伪宪，发动和进行了的解放区的全面进攻，已经为举世共知的事实，说明了他“不消灭共党死不瞑目”的决心。如今却公然向美记者宣布他“决不和共产党妥协”，其目的无非在他的美国主子如范登堡之流面前充硬汉，索取美国反动派对他更多的帮助。同时，也暴露当他的山穷水尽，窘态暴露；在政治经济军事上，已遭遇严重的危机。现在美国帝国主义与蒋介石真正是打成一片，合穿了一条裤子。“美方官员也表示和蒋氏相同之观点”，这当然没有什么稀奇。纽约时报公然写道：“中国问题也就是美国的问题”，顾维钧说：“中国的财政经济当然为美国所关心。”蒋美浑然一体，蒋介石放肆地卖国，美国帝国主义也就可以放肆的趁火打劫。至于蒋介石对其主子的“微词”，那只是娼妓的撒娇。他嫌美国帝国主义的对华侵略与帮助蒋介石绞杀中共与中国一切民主人士的作为还不够彻底。这十足暴露了蒋介石这个卖国贼比秦桧还狠毒万倍的心肠。他的谈话发表后，却又授意他的宣传部长彭学沛出面“更正”，否认曾经“责备”美国云云，这更加显出他一付媚外的奴才相。
