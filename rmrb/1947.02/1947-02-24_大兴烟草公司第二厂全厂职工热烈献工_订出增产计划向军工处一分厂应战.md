[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Daxing Tobacco Company No. 2 Factory, under the Public-Operated Management Office, in response to Comrade Bo Yibo's and the Trade Union Federation's call for production and thrift, all employees enthusiastically launched a labor offering campaign and drafted an increased production and thrift plan to challenge Military Industry Division No. 1 Factory and challenge Factories No. 1, 3, and 4 of the company.

　　While studying the documents calling for production and thrift, the factory's employees strengthened their confidence in defeating Chiang Kai-shek and clarified the task of the Chinese working class today. Worker Yuan Desheng said, "Chiang Kai-shek's American weapons are useless. Our Eighth Route Army has already defeated 59 of his brigades. If we defeat another 40 or 50, we will launch a major counter-offensive!" Machine rolling worker Xie Sitang said, "The life of us workers in the liberated areas is truly like heaven compared to the workers in the Chiang-controlled areas! We must produce well, supply the front lines to win victories, and liberate those unemployed worker brothers in the Chiang-controlled areas."

　　When the factory held a general meeting of all employees to discuss how to respond to the call with practical actions, the workers' emotions were exceptionally high. Xie Sitang, representing the second major group, said, "After Japan surrendered and there was peace, our workers' wages immediately increased a lot, and our lives improved. But Chiang Kai-shek won't let us live a good life. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and strive for victory in the counter-offensive, I propose to restore the hard life of the eight-year war of resistance." Workers Jiang Baocheng and Yuan Desheng continued, "We agree to restore the tough style of the Taihang Mountains. We suffer today in order to live a good life in the future. The more hardship we endure and the more effort we put in today, the more enemies the soldiers on the front lines can kill, Chiang Kai-shek will fall sooner, and victory will come sooner." At this point, tobacco wrapper Duan Songshan, ingredients mixer Hu Xiu, and packaging worker Li Naiyue successively spoke, unanimously expressing their willingness to make contributions to the people, step up production, and volunteer to offer five days of free labor each month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated.

　　At the meeting, amidst the shouts of "Support labor offering, defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" seventy-three people volunteered to sign up, offering 562 days of labor. The chief of the industrial affairs section also proposed on behalf of all cadres to change the salary system to a supply system, abolish Sundays, and implement it until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, expressing the determination to share weal and woe with the workers. On the spot, all employees unanimously passed a resolution to change the full week to a half-week system (resting half a day on Sunday), thoroughly implement the ten-hour workday system every day, and at the same time formulate an increased production and thrift plan, guaranteeing to improve production quantity and quality and reduce costs, as conditions for challenging Military Industry Division No. 1 Factory and challenging Factories No. 1, 3, and 4 of the company.
