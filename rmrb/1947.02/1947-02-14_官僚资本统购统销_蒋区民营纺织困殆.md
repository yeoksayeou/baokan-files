    Bureaucratic Capital's Unified Purchase and Sale
    Private Textile Industry in the Chiang Area Faces Ruin
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 11th: Shanghai News: The Chiang government has re-implemented cotton yarn and cloth controls. According to regulations issued by the authorities, starting from January 1, 1947, for cotton yarn produced by yarn factories that obtained foreign exchange from the Chiang government to purchase cotton, or cotton cloth self-woven from yarn, the Chiang government will purchase half of it at a price based on its cost plus 20% profit. This purchase method has been implemented since January 13th. Generally, independent industrialists are extremely anxious. They believe that the Chiang government's purpose in doing this is: (1) to supply the military cloth needed for its civil war; (2) following the China Textile Industries Corporation's monopoly of the cotton textile industry, to further control and exploit the entire private cotton textile industry through this. This is a reappearance of the wartime cotton yarn and cloth policy, and also a new method of low-price exploitation. The Economic Weekly, Volume 4, Issue 1, commented: "From now on, the government's controllable yarn and cloth can be expanded from one-third of the total output to two-thirds. Under further control, the end of the private textile industry is approaching."

    蒋区民营纺织困殆
    【新华社延安十一日电】沪息：蒋政府重新实行纱布管制。据当局颁布办法规定，自三十六年一月一日起，凡由蒋政府供给外汇购棉之纱厂所得之棉纱或由纱自织之棉布，均由蒋政府依其成本并加百分之二十的利润之价格收购其半数。此收购办法已自一月十三日起实行，一般自由工业家极感焦虑，他们认为：蒋政府此举之目的在于；（一）供给其内战的军布需要。（二）继中纺公司独占棉纺业之后，又借此进一步控制与剥削全部民营棉织业。此乃战时花纱布政策之再现，亦是低价剥削的新办法。此间经济周报四卷一期评称：“从此政府可控制的纱布，可由全部产量的三分之一扩充到三分之二，民营纺织工业在进一步统制下，末路快要到了。”
