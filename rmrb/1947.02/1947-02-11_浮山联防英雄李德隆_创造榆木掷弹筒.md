    Fushan Joint Defense Hero Li Delong
    Creates Elm Wood Grenade Launcher
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 9th] Li Delong, the sharpshooter hero of the Fushan Spider-Web Joint Defense, painstakingly researched and created the elm wood grenade launcher during the war. It combines an elm wood cannon with a hand grenade. It is easy to manufacture, throws far, and can be fired up to 350 meters in two seconds with good accuracy. After testing by the County Military Committee, it was deemed a good weapon for the militia. On the 7th of last month, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the city came out to harass us, sharpshooter Li Delong used the elm wood grenade launcher for the first time on the north slope of Chennan River, killing several enemies with one shot.

    浮山联防英雄李德隆
    创造榆木掷弹筒
    【本报太岳九日电】浮山蛛网联防英雄神枪手李德隆，利用战争时期，辛苦研究创造了榆木掷弹筒。系将榆木炮与手榴弹结合而成，制造方便掷得远，能在两秒钟内，射达三百五十米达，准头又好。经县武委会试验，认为是民兵的良好武器。上月七日城内蒋军出扰，神枪手李德隆在臣南河北坡上，首次使用榆木掷弹筒，一弹就毙敌数人。
