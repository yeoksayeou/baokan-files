Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: TASS, Tokyo - The Japanese Communist Party's (JCP) newspaper "Red Flag" published an article on the 7th by Shiga, a member of the JCP's Political Bureau, titled "The General Strike is Prohibited, But the Struggle Continues." It pointed out that the current poverty of Japanese workers is because the Yoshida Cabinet is leading the country to ruin, and not fundamentally relieving the increasingly dire lives of the working people. The government did not show sincerity in negotiations with the workers, but haggled with them like a small shop owner. Shiga said that the trade unions had cancelled the general strike, but it was not possible to deprive them of their right to fight for a minimum standard of living. In conclusion, Mr. Shiga pointed out that the Yoshida Cabinet is trying to divide the unity of the working people and called for strengthening the movement to overthrow the cabinet, calling on workers and peasants to unite with those being repatriated, those affected by war disasters, and small and medium-sized property owners to establish a democratic people's front.

    日共领袖志贺著文
    号召建立日本人民阵线
    加强团结继续开展倒阁运动
    【新华社延安十日电】塔斯社东京讯：日共机关报《红旗》，七日刊载日共政治局委员志贺所撰“总罢工被禁止了，但斗争在继续中”一文。指出：目前日本工人的困贫，是由于吉田内阁正导国家入于毁灭之途，而根本不是救济劳动人民益形惨重的生活。政府在与工人谈判时未曾表示诚意，而是像小商店老板一样与工人斤斤计较。志贺说工会取消了总罢工，但没有可能剥夺他们为最低生活水准而战斗的权利。志贺氏结语中指出吉田内阁正图分裂劳动人民的团结，并号召加强倒阁运动，号召工人农民联合起来与遗送回国的人，受战争灾难的人，及中小有产者一起建立民主的人民阵线。
