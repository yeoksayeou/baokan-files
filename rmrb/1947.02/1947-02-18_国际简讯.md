　　International Briefs
    According to a delayed Washington dispatch from the Associated Press, dated January 24th: The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) of America has published a booklet stating that it intends to join the World Federation of Trade Unions with labor groups from the Soviet Union and other countries to jointly maintain democracy and peace.
    London dispatch: The United States recently refused to buy 2.25 million tons of "surplus" potatoes from the United States, citing the prevention of domestic food from being harmed. According to a U.S. Information Service cable dated February 2nd, the United States had a surplus of more than 4.68 million tons of potatoes last year. It was originally estimated that Britain needed 3.28 million tons, so the United States still had a surplus of 1.4 million tons of potatoes that could not be processed. Now that Britain has greatly reduced its purchases, the amount of so-called "surplus" potatoes that the United States will destroy in order to maintain high prices for agricultural products will be even more staggering. According to previous assessments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it has already planned to destroy 620,000 tons of potatoes.
    New Delhi dispatch: Former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw, while transiting through New Delhi on his return to Burma from London, declared that the British government had not given a satisfactory response to Burma's demand for independence. U Saw is a member of the Burmese delegation and has refused to participate in the agreement signed by Aung San and Attlee.
    Radio Moscow correspondent Petrov reports: The negotiations between U.S. representatives and Philippine President Roxas regarding the issue of U.S. military bases have concluded. According to U.S. demands, the Philippine President has agreed to allow the United States to establish naval bases in the Philippines. The outcome of these negotiations provides a legal basis for the stationing of U.S. troops in the Philippines, and the United States uses various laws to ensure its dominant position in the economic life of the Philippines. The Philippines remains a colony of the United States.

    伦敦讯：美国最近以防止国内粮食遭受危害为辞，已拒绝收买美国“剩余”之二百二十五万吨洋芋。又据美新闻处二月二日电，美国去年结存之洋芋多至四百六十八万余吨，原计英国须要三百二十八万吨，因此美国尚剩余一百四十万吨洋芋，无法处理。今英国既大量停购，则美国为维持农产品高额价格，而行将毁坏之所谓“剩余”洋芋量数字必更惊人。按美农业评前已计划毁坏洋芋六十二万吨。
