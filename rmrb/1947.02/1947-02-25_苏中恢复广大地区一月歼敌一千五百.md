Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: The Suzhong Military Region (including the area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Xinghua-Dongtai line) recently announced its battle results for January, stating that a large amount of lost territory south of the Bengyan River in the territory of Zou Tong County (a new county, northeast of Feng County) has been recovered. Except for the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Dazhongji and Xiaoyan along the Dong (Dongtai) - Yan (Yancheng) Road, the large area of 15,000 square miles is also under the control of the people. In this month, local militia fought more than eighty times, and the people's militia fought more than a thousand times, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 1,500 Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Legions," seizing one mortar, twenty light and heavy machine guns, and more than 370 rifles, and recovering more than 20 large and small strongholds such as Yazhouzhuang near Yingxi in Taixing, Xiaohai, Xizha, and Xituan north of Tai (Dongtai), Kunbao on the Baoying Canal line, Wang D橋, a major town on the Lin (Ze)-Jie (Shou) highway, and Maoshan and Yankou in Qintong.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: The military and civilians in the Second Sub-district of Su (near Baoying and Xinghua) launched a political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the "Homecoming Legions." Since the Spring Festival, they have won over more than 200 "Homecoming Legion" members and fugitives to return to their hometowns. More than half of those who were coerced into fleeing by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Baoying have returned, and more than 100 fugitives from the Pingwang District in the suburbs of Xinghua have returned to their hometowns. Shi Liangxin, a member of the "Homecoming Legion" in Qintong Zhou Zhuang, returned to his hometown and, with the help of the masses, reorganized the long-stalled oil mill and started production. Under the influence of the New Fourth Army's victory, the contradictions between Chiang Kai-shek's "Homecoming Legions" and "Self-Defense Forces" and Chiang Kai-shek's troops are deepening. Zhao Hongyin, the Chiang Kai-shek district chief of Pinglu District in Xinghua, committed suicide by hanging himself after being fined 270 shi of wheat for failing to provide enough boatmen for Chiang Kai-shek's troops. In mid-January, the district drew the following experiences from the offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's troops: (1) The working methods can include holding meetings of "Homecoming Legion" family members, beating gongs to make announcements, and issuing merit and demerit books; (2) It is necessary to understand the specific situation, select key points for work, and focus on explaining the lenient policy to those who have been won over to eliminate their concerns; (3) Political work must be combined with military struggle to disintegrate the enemy under the active armed actions of all the military and civilians, and this should be listed as regular work.
