　　Guaranteeing Early Completion of Wartime Support Tasks
    Dongda Women and Children Transport Grain
    Saving Over a Hundred Male Labor Days, 24 Model Individuals Emerge
    [Our Dispatch] After the mass transport efforts last winter, the consciousness of the masses in Dongda Village, Sixth District of She County, has greatly improved. Liberated peasants throughout the village, regardless of gender or age, eagerly joined the grain transport and reception station work. Since the leadership assigned the grain transport task after the New Year, Ren Guiying, the director of the Women's Association, had been brewing a call to action in the winter school. At that time, 19 women voluntarily signed up, and under their influence, 66 women and 102 children were organized into a grain transport brigade. In total, they transported grain three times, with women carrying 4,750 jin and children carrying 3,200 jin, saving a total of 133 male labor days. In addition to completing the originally assigned 90,000 jin, they transported an extra 950 jin. During the grain transport, 24 model individuals emerged among the women and children. Women Shen Lianxian and Guo Sannv each carried 60 jin every time. When the director of the Farmers' Association got tired on the road, they even helped him carry the load together. The men all said in unison, "The women have truly been liberated! At first, we were afraid the women would get tired on the road, but we didn't expect them to be even better than us!" In addition, seven old men in the village joined the reception station work, boiling four large pots of water every day for the passing grain transport teams. Among them, Li Gouzi is partially blind and used to beg for food. After liberation, he was allocated two mu of paddy fields and three rooms. At the reception station, he eagerly carried seven or eighty loads of water every day, and everyone praised his ability. (Xi Zhenzhong, Ma Changtai, Zhao Yuanqing, Qin Ruxiang)

　　保证战勤任务提前完成
    东达妇女儿童运粮
    节省男劳力百余工涌现模范二十四人
    【本报讯】涉县六区东达村经过去冬群运，群众觉悟大为提高，全村翻身农民不分男女老少争先恐后卷入运粮及招待站工作。自年关领导上布置运粮后，妇女会主任任贵英便在冬学里酝酿号召，当时有十九个妇女自动报名，并在她们的影响下组织起来六十六个妇女、一百零二个儿童参加了运粮大队。总计运了三次，妇女背了四千七百五十斤，儿童背了三千二百斤，合计节省了男劳力一百三十三个工，除原数九万斤按排完成外，又多运了九百五十斤。在运粮时妇女儿童中涌现了二十四名模范，妇女申莲先、郭三女每次都是担六十斤，路上农会主任走累了，她们还帮助他伙担。男人们都异口同声地说：“妇女们可真翻了身！起先咱怕妇女们累路，不想比咱还行哩！”此外，该村有七个老汉加入招待站工作，每天要给来往运粮队烧四大锅开水。其中李狗子是个半瞎子，过去常到外边讨饭，翻身后分了二亩水地、三间房子。在招待站上他每天抢着担七、八十担水，人人称赞他能干。（席振中、马常太、赵元庆、秦如香）
