　　Lu Nan Chiang Troops Suffer Severe Setbacks
　　Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare Presents a New Situation
　　This week (February 9th to 15th), the main battlefield remained in Lu Nan. On the northern front, Wang Jingwu forcibly ordered the miscellaneous troops of Huo Shouyi to advance south from Jiangwu alone, attempting to coordinate with the frontal offensive. So far, they have been obstructed in an area more than 200 miles northwest of Linyi, and their long communication lines are in danger of being cut off from time to time. On the southern front, Hao Pengju, a traitor to the people, has received his due punishment. Only eleven days after defecting to Chiang, he was captured alive by the People's Liberation Army, and his headquarters and the entire Second and Fourth Divisions were annihilated. The Central News Agency once boasted that Hao's defection "had a major impact on the situation in Lu Nan and Su Bei," but now all their joy has vanished. Chiang Kai-shek's air force has indiscriminately bombed Linyi and other towns in Lu Nan for days, killing and wounding hundreds of peaceful residents, arousing the boundless anger of the people of Shandong. The Lu Nan war continues to develop. The Central News Agency has fabricated "battle results" and publicized them, but the Associated Press sees that "the Kuomintang has actually suffered a serious defeat in the Linyi area, many of their troops have been killed and captured, and morale is extremely low."
　　On the flanks of the Lu Nan battlefield—on the Longhai Road west of Xuzhou—fighting for reinforcement and obstruction is unfolding. General Liu Bocheng's powerful corps has cut off the Longhai Railway, trapping Chiang's Fifth Army and Seventy-fifth Division in the Shangqiu-Minquan area. Following this, they recovered the five cities of Qixian, Luyi, Zhecheng, Bozhou, and Taikang (Taikang was once evacuated on the 9th, but recovered six hours later), annihilating more than 10,000 enemies. On the 9th, they also recovered the two cities of Suixian and Ningling simultaneously, opening up a new area of more than 200 square kilometers on the south side of the Longhai Road.
　　The battle reports received this week show that anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare has begun to enter a new phase. Guerrilla corps are accumulating small victories into large victories, developing from holding small liberated areas to restoring large liberated areas, and at the same time, they are able to take advantage of the Chiang army's weakness to attack more important cities.
　　The Jidong People's Guerrilla Force captured Qianmafang, near Qinhuangdao, in one fell swoop on the 4th. From the 3rd to the 5th, they successively captured important towns and villages such as Anping Town, Luotun, Chenxinzhuang, Wangjiaban, Hexiwu west of Xianghe, and Banqiao Town east of Ninghe. The Pingjin Highway was cut off in the middle. On the 7th, they once again attacked Baodi City and its station, causing great shock in Tianjin and Beijing.
　　The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Su Wan are trapped in several empty cities, and their "government orders" cannot leave the city. The Suzhong People's Guerrilla Force uprooted more than a dozen strongholds in Xinghua alone, including Dongpao. Since the end of last month, the Huaibei People's Guerrilla Force has successively recovered important towns and villages such as Zhangji between Pixian and Suining, Guirenji and Jietouji between Sixian and Suqian, and Caoxu in Sixian. The Huaihai People's Guerrilla Force also uprooted four strongholds, including Luji and G塞. In the above large and small battles, a total of more than 3,000 enemies were annihilated.
　　This week, the People's Liberation Army recovered the two cities of Suixian and Ningling and the two stations of Xushui and Caohe in the northern section of Pinghan. Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the three cities of Shanxian, Yixian, and Chengwu. (Xinhua News Agency, February 16th)

### 鲁南蒋军遭严重挫折  敌后游击战呈新局面

　　鲁南蒋军遭严重挫折
    敌后游击战呈新局面
    本周（九日至十五日）主要战场仍在鲁南，北线王经武强令杂牌军霍守义部孤军由江芜南下，企图配合正面攻势，迄今仍被阻挠于临沂西北二百余里地区，且其绵长之交通线时有被切断之虞。南线叛变人民的郝鹏举已受到了应得惩罚，投蒋仅十一天，即被人民解放军生擒，其总部和二、四两个师全部就歼。中央社过去曾吹嘘郝部叛变“对鲁南、苏北局事发生重大影响”，现在一团高兴全部落空。蒋家空军连日滥炸临沂及鲁南各城镇，死伤和平居民百余人，激起山东人民的无比愤怒。鲁南战争仍在继续发展中，连日中央社捏造“战果”大肆宣传，可是合众社却看到“国民党实际上在临沂区吃到严重的败仗，很多国军被击毙被俘，士气极为低落”。
    在鲁南战场的侧背——徐州以西的陇海路上，正展开了增援和阻援的战事，刘伯承将军强大兵团横断了陇海铁路，使蒋军第五军和七十五师等部被困在商邱民权一带，并且又紧接着收复杞县、鹿邑、柘城、亳县、太康五城（按太康曾于九日一度撤离，六小时后即告收复）歼敌万余人之后，又于九日同时收回睢县、宁陵两城，在陇海路南侧开辟了二百余平方公里的新地区。
    这一周收到的战报，显示敌后游击战开始进入了新的局面，游击兵团积小胜为大胜，从坚持小块解放区发展为恢复大块解放区，同时并能利用蒋军兵力薄弱攻入较重要的城市。
    冀东人民游击队在四日一举收复临近秦皇岛的前马坊，三日至五日内相继攻克香河以西的安平镇、罗屯、陈辛庄、王家板、河西务以及宁河以东的板桥镇等重要村镇，平津公路被拦腰切断，七日复一度攻入宝坻城及其车站，平津两市大为震动。
    苏皖蒋军困守着几座空城，“政令”不能出城，苏中人民游击队仅在兴化一地即拔除东炮等十余据点。淮北人民游击队，自上月下旬以来，先后收复邳县、睢宁间的张集、泗县宿迁间的归仁集、界头集、泗县的曹圩等重要村镇，淮海人民游击队也拔除陆集，古塞等四座据点。在以上大小战斗中，共歼敌三千多人。
    这一周内人民解放军收复睢县、宁陵两城及平汉北段徐水漕河两车站，蒋军侵占单县、易县、城武三城。（新华社十六日电）
