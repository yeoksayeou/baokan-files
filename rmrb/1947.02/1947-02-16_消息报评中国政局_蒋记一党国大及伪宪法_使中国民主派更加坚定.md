Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: TASS Moscow, 11th: Izvestia commentator Olimpiyev commented on China's "National Assembly," saying: Chinese democrats believe that convening the "National Assembly" and promulgating the "Constitution" are another trick of the Kuomintang, the purpose of which is to split the domestic democratic camp and achieve certain goals in diplomacy, primarily to ensure continued US support in the civil war. It is no wonder that some American newspapers are singing the praises of the Chinese "Constitution." The New York Times was even so moved as to say that it was "a symbol of the dawn of the new world shining throughout Asia." In reality, convening the "National Assembly" and promulgating the "Constitution" do not solve China's major political problems at all, and they further exacerbate the domestic political situation. Now, democrats cannot but realize that what stands before them is a reactionary force backed by the United States, attempting to keep the country in a semi-colonial, oppressed state. The "National Assembly" undoubtedly helps to clarify the situation, drawing a line between democracy and reaction, and true democrats are prepared to continue fighting for China's democracy.

　　消息报评中国政局
    蒋记一党国大及伪宪法
    使中国民主派更加坚定
    【新华社延安十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：消息报观察家奥利米也夫评论中国“国民大会”称：中国民主人士认为召开“国大”及颁布“宪法”是国民党的另一手法，其目的在于分裂国内的民主阵营及在外交上达到某些目的，首先是保证它在内战中继续得到美国的支持。难怪美国某些报纸在大肆赞扬中国“宪法”，纽约时报甚至感动到这样的程度，说它是“新世界的曙光遍照亚洲的象征”。实则召开“国大”与颁布“宪法”根本谈不上解决了中国的重大政治问题，而又使国内的政治形势更加紧张。如今民主分子不能不了解到摆在他们面前的是反对美国作后台的，企图把国家停滞在半殖民地被压迫地位的反动派；“国民大会”无疑是有助于澄清形势，它在民主与反动之间划了一道鸿沟，而真正的民主分子则准备为中国的民主而继续斗争下去。
