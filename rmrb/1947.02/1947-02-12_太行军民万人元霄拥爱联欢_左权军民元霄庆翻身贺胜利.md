    Zuoquan Military and Civilians Celebrate the Lantern Festival, Rejoicing in Liberation and Victory
    [This Dispatch from Our Taihang Office on the 6th] To celebrate the Lantern Festival, over ten thousand military personnel and civilians in the Taihang area held a get-together to support the army and cherish the people in Zhangnan Town, She County. Participants included soldiers from directly subordinate units and male and female residents from the first and ninth districts of She County. Throughout the day, gongs and drums resounded on both banks of the Zhang River, and dozens of stilt walkers and Yangko dancers joyfully sang songs about liberation and supporting the army. Local rural theatrical troupes gathered in Zhangnan Town and She County to perform. The troops also presented programs like the "Overlord Whip" dance. The peasants who attended were dressed in bright red and green, their faces beaming with smiles, fully expressing their prosperity and joyful mood after liberation. Villagers brought numerous gifts to support the army, including towels, soap, chickens, eggs, walnuts, persimmon cakes... as well as countless comfort bags and letters of support for the soldiers at the front. During the meeting, Minister Guo of the Military Region's Political Department's Mass Movement Department and Vice County Head Si Rong of She County called on the military and civilians to continue to unite closely and work together to defeat the bandit Chiang. The troops and the masses exchanged mutual pledges of supporting the government and cherishing the people, and supporting the army, pledging to guarantee their implementation. Finally, the Military Region presented the government with a banner that said "Serve the People," thanking the government and the people for their support of the front lines.
    [This Dispatch from Our Zuoquan Office] On the eve of the Lantern Festival, more than two thousand people from military, government, and civilian circles in Zuoquan City held a grand get-together to celebrate the liberation of the people and congratulate the victory on the self-defense front. When the heroic soldiers of the XX Regiment, who had just returned gloriously from the front lines, carried machine guns and cannons seized from the enemy into the venue, an old man from Xiguan Street led his little grandson, pointing to the troops and saying, "Look! Our Chairman Mao's army is so mighty! They are the benefactors who let us eat dumplings for the New Year!" After the meeting, Regiment Commander Ran reported on the XX Regiment's half-year record of self-defense and called on all officers and soldiers to earnestly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, strengthen the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people, and respond to the people's ardent hopes and love by winning battles to eliminate the reactionary party's offensive. Vice County Head Gong, on behalf of the 95,000 people of Zuoquan, extended a salute of condolences to the officers and soldiers who had fought for a long time and returned from the front lines. He also called on the people of the whole county to: (1) Do a good job in logistics and work hard to produce and support the front lines; (2) Help military families and families of martyrs to establish their households and solve all their difficulties. Yin Chengming, a liberated peasant from South Street, said: As long as it is for the army and for the front lines, we should do our best to do it first. As the慰劳 began, loads of food, vermicelli, tofu, chicken, meat, towels, soap, etc., were sent to the stage, expressing the people's love for the army. (Jing Tang, Pi Yu)
