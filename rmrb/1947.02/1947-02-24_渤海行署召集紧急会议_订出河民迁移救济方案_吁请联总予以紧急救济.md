Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd. The Bohai Liberated Area Administrative Office convened an emergency meeting on the 10th, attended by the heads of civil affairs from eleven counties including Kenli, Putai, Lijin, and Qingcheng, to discuss the relocation and relief of residents on both sides of the old course of the Yellow River. At the meeting, each county reported on the progress of emergency repairs and immigration. Taking Kenli County as an example, 105 villages with 6,520 households and 20,635 people in the riverbed area must be relocated. Each county has formulated preliminary relief plans. For example, Lijin County is organizing disaster victims to develop textile sideline businesses; Qingcheng County is developing papermaking, weaving handicrafts, and water and land transportation. Kenli County plans to build new villages and reclaim 20,000 mu of wasteland to solve the housing and land problems of more than 1,000 households, and develop fishery, animal husbandry, textile, transportation, and other sideline businesses, which can solve the livelihoods of more than 5,000 households of refugees. The total cost of relocation and resettlement of refugees in the Bohai region is estimated at over 1.9 billion Northern Currency (equivalent to 290 billion Kuomintang currency), which is beyond the capacity of the people in the liberated areas. The region has appealed to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for emergency relief.

　　渤海行署召集紧急会议
    订出河民迁移救济方案
    吁请联总予以紧急救济
    【新华社山东二十二日电】渤海解放区行政公署于十日召集垦利、蒲台、利津、青城等十一县民政科长紧急会议，研讨黄河故道两侧居民的迁移救济事宜。会上各县汇报抢修移民等情形，以垦利一县而论，河床被灾居民必须迁移者达一○五村，六千五百二十户，二万零六百三十五人。各县为此曾作出初步救济方案，如利津组织灾民发展纺织副业；青城发展造纸编织手工业及水陆运输等；垦利计划另建新村，开荒二万亩，以解决一千余户居民的居住与土地问题，并发展渔、牧、纺织、运输等副业，可解决五千余户难民的生活。总计渤海全区难民的迁移安置费，需北币十九亿余元之巨（合蒋币二百九十亿元）殊非解放区人民所能负担。该区已吁请联总行总予以紧急救济。
