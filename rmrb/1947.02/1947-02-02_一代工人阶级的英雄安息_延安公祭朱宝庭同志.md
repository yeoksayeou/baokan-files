　　A Generation of Working Class Heroes Rests in Peace
    Yan'an Holds Public Memorial for Comrade Zhu Baoting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] On the afternoon of the 29th, people from all walks of life in Yan'an held a public memorial service at the General Office of the CCP Central Committee for Zhu Baoting, a leader of the Chinese working class. More than 600 people from all walks of life in Yan'an and Zhu's former comrades-in-arms attended. Amidst mournful music, Zhu Baoting's wife, Zhang Xiuzhen, and others held a family memorial service, followed by the public memorial. The main officiants were Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Liu Shaoqi, with Xie Juezai, Yang Zhihua, and Zhu Zhicheng as co-officiants. Zeng San read the eulogy aloud, and Zhou Enlai reported on Zhu's heroic deeds in fighting against imperialism and its running dogs, the feudal warlords, throughout his life. He emphasized, "Comrade Baoting was loyal to the cause of liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese workers, for thirty years as one day; even on the day before his death, he wrote to me to show concern for a comrade who was working as a seaman in the KMT-controlled area." Liu Shaoqi, in his speech, emphasized that Zhu represented the excellent qualities of the Chinese working class. He joined the Communist Party in 1922, when there were only thirty-odd Communist Party members in Shanghai. In the early days of the Party's founding, he demonstrated exemplary Party spirit of consciously, automatically, and resolutely implementing the Party's resolutions and respecting the organization. He was the first to lead Chinese seamen workers onto the political stage. In Shanghai, he often used his meager income to pay Party dues and fought with unwavering determination, never caring about personal life or gains and losses. After the memorial service, representatives from all walks of life escorted the coffin to the Martyrs' Cemetery for burial. In the fading twilight, this "hero of the working class" (Mao Zedong's eulogy) was laid to rest in the sacred land of democratic China.

　　一代工人阶级的英雄安息
    延安公祭朱宝庭同志
    【新华社延安三十日电】延安各界于二十九日下午三时在中共中央办公厅公祭中国工人领袖朱宝庭。到延安各界及朱氏生前战友六百余人。哀乐声中，朱宝庭夫人张秀珍等举行家祭后，即开始公祭。主祭人为朱总司令、刘少奇，陪祭人谢觉斋、杨芝华及祝志澄，曾三慕读祭文，周恩来报告朱氏一生与帝国主义及其走狗封建军阀斗争的英勇事迹，并着重地说：“宝庭同志忠于中华民族与中国工人的解放事业，三十年如一日；即在他临终前一天，还写信给我关心一位在蒋管区担负海员工作的同志。”刘少奇讲话时，强调朱氏代表着中国工人阶级的优秀品质；他一九二二年参加共产党，当时上海仅有三十多个共产党员。在建党初期，即表现了自觉自动坚决执行党的决议和尊重组织的模范党性。他是第一个领导了中国海员工人走上政治舞台。在上海，他经常以收入微薄的工资缴纳党费，坚贞不屈的斗争，从不计较个人生活与得失。追悼会后，由各界代表送灵榇至烈士公墓安葬。在暮色苍茫中，此一代“工人阶级的英雄”（毛主席挽词）遂安眠于民主中国的圣地。
