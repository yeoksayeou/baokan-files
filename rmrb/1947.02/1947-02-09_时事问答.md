    Current Affairs Q&A
    To Comrades Lei Fang and a reader from the Public Security Bureau General Bureau:
    We have received your letters, asking about (1) the differences between the two houses of the French Parliament; (2) which countries are referred to by the Fourth Republic; and (3) the relationship between the French Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Army. Based on what I know, I will briefly answer as follows:
    (1) According to the French new constitution, the two houses of the French Parliament are: “The Parliament is composed of the National Assembly and the Senate of the Republic. The National Assembly has "complete legislative power" and is composed of six hundred and seventeen members elected by "direct, equal, secret and universal suffrage." The Senate of the Republic has between two hundred and fifty and three hundred and twenty members, some appointed by the National Assembly and some elected by electoral colleges (composed of people elected by towns and provinces). The Senate can draft bills and submit them to the National Assembly for decision. The legislation of the National Assembly can also solicit the opinions of the Senate. If the Senate has amendments or vetoes, the National Assembly must re-vote with an absolute majority." The two houses secretly vote together to elect the president. The Senate is also known as the Upper House, and the National Assembly is also known as the Lower House.
    (2) "Fourth Republic" does not refer to those countries, but refers to the fact that France has established a republic four times. The first was established on September 22, 1792, overthrowing the feudal autocratic dynasty. The second was established in February 1840, overthrowing the restoration of King Louis Philippe. The third was established in 1870 after the Franco-Prussian War, abolishing Napoleon III's autocracy. The Fourth Republic refers to the fact that France re-established its constitution after this World War and became a new democratic country.
    (3) The French Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Army are equal in terms of administrative relations, but there are significant differences in their powers. The Ministry of Defense is responsible for the overall planning, mobilization, deployment, training, and overall command and strategic decision-making of the navy, army, and air force during combat. The Ministry of the Army is only responsible for the administrative affairs of the army and acts according to the plans of the Ministry of Defense.

    时事问答雷方、公安总局一读者同志：
    先后收到你们的信，问到（一）法国国会的两院有何不同？（二）第四共和国指的那几个国家。（三）法国国防部与陆军部之关系如何等问题。仅就所知，简复如下：
    （一）法国议会的两院，根据法国新宪法的规定为：“国会由国民议会及共和国参院两院组成。国民议会有“完全的立法权”，由“直接、平等、秘密而普遍的选举”，产生议员六百十七名组成。共和国参院有议员二百五十到三百二十名，一部分由国民议会任命，一部分由选民团（该团由各镇各省选出的人员组成）选举。参院可以草拟法案，交由国民议会决定。国民议会的立法，也可以征询参院的意见，参院如有修正或否决，则国民议会须从绝大多数重新表决之”。两院秘密投票共同选出总统。参院亦称上院，国民议会亦称下院。
    （二）“第四共和国”，不是指那几个国家，而是指法国已经四度建立了共和国。第一次成立于一七九二年九月二十二日，推翻封建专制的王朝。第二次成立于一八四○年二月，推翻法王路易腓力的复辟。第三次成立于一八七○年普法战争后，废除了拿破仑第三的专政。第四共和国是指此次世界大战后，法国重订宪法，成为新民主主义的国家。
    （三）法国国防部与陆军部，在行政关系上是平等的，而在职权上则有重大区别。国防部职掌海陆空军的全盘计划，调动，配备、训练、以及在作战时的全面指挥，战略决定。陆军部仅仅负责陆军的行政事宜，根据国防部的计划行事。
