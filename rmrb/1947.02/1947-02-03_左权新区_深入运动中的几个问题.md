　　Zuoquan New District
    Several Issues in the Deepening Movement
    Liu Yinlong
    The Zuoquan New District created several experiences in the deepening movement stage:
    I. Starting with resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and then uniting the farmers internally and thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants: In the last major movement, many problems were left over due to the unfair distribution of fruits. According to a survey in Hanwang, among the 37 households that received fruits, cadres and activists accounted for 16. There were even individual cadres who received buildings while the masses only received thatched sheds, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses towards the cadres. In this in-depth inspection, cadres were mobilized to conduct self-criticism to adjust relations with the masses, but the problem was not prolonged in internal disputes among the farmers. We analyzed that the cadres' sheltering of selfishness was mostly caused by the attacks of landlords. For example, in Hanwang, a special agent element from a bankrupt landlord family was discovered, who was hiding in the village cadres and carrying out instigation and sabotage work, attempting to create rifts and opposition between cadres and the masses. After the masses' ideological awareness improved, the target was immediately turned to the struggle against the special agent feudal cliques. In this way, internal unity was achieved, and the farmers' political awareness was improved.
    II. Facing backward problems: In the deepening movement, overcoming the complacency of village cadres and activists and facing the backward masses was the key to opening up the situation. The Majiu Village broke through this key by launching cadres to recall their emancipation experiences. From concrete facts, they overcame their complacent thinking of looking down on backward farmers after they had been emancipated, and put forward the slogan "Give a Helping Hand" to help poor brothers become emancipated, and took the initiative to unite and mobilize the backward farmers. In this way, 25 honest farmers in Majiu actively participated in the movement.
    III. Throughout the ideological mobilization: In carrying out the movement to fill in the gaps and make up for deficiencies, it once caused ideological confusion among some of the masses and disorganization of the ranks. A thought spread among the masses in the Chengguan District: "More land is feudalism, and wealth is a remnant." "If you cut the hemp, you'll expose the stubble. If you overthrow the landlords, you're afraid you'll be next." After ideological inspection, a total of 39 households (mostly middle peasants) were panicked about the fill-in policy. The middle peasant Li Haizhen believed that raising pigs this year would make a profit of 10,000 yuan, which would also become a "remnant," and was preparing to donate money to the masses. After the leadership discovered this, they encouraged the masses to launch a free discussion, so that the farmers clearly understood that feudal exploitation was the feudal remnant, dispelling the concerns of most middle peasants. Some poor and hired peasants were not aware, so they were enlightened to come forward to complain and struggle. The hired peasant Sun Xiaosan, after complaining and calculating accounts, recalled the scenes of suffering under the landlords for three generations, breaking the previous idea that fighting the landlords was really desolate, and revealed the property hidden by the landlords on the wall, becoming an activist. The poor peasants Chen Sanman and Song Zhongwen, who had always been silent, eliminated their fatalistic thoughts in the mass struggle actions. They consciously stood in the position of masters and united all the farmers, launched a joint struggle against the landlord Chen Sanyang in Chengguan, and achieved victory. According to the different ideological situations of the masses, ideological mobilization was carried out in every action.

    深入运动中的几个问题
    刘印龙
    左权新区在深入运动阶段创造了几点经验：
    一、从解决干部与群众关系着手，进而团结农民内部、彻底消灭封建尾巴：在上次大运动中由于分配果实不公遗留下不少问题，据寒王调查分得果实三十七户中，干部积极分子就占了十六户。甚至有个别干部分得楼房，群众只分了草棚的，引起群众对干部不满。在这次深入检查中，发动干部检讨，调整群众关系，但并未把问题长期停留在农民内部纠纷上。我们分析了干部包庇自私，多由地主进攻引起的，如寒王发现一个出身破落地主特务分子，即隐藏在村干部中进行挑拨破坏工作。企图造成干部与群众间裂痕与对立。当群众的思想觉悟之后，立即把目标转向特务封建集团斗争。这样内部达到团结，而且使农民在政治觉悟上得到提高。
    二、面向落后问题：在深入运动中，对克服村干部积极分子自满、面向落后群众，是打开局面的关键。马厩村是从发动干部翻身回忆中突破了这个关键，从具体事实中，打通其翻了身看不起落后农民的自满思想，提出“拉一把”口号，帮助穷弟兄翻身，主动去团结与发动落后层农民。这样马厩即有二十五个老实农民积极起来参加运动。
    三、贯穿思想发动问题：在开展填平补齐运动中，曾引起一部分群众思想迷惘和阵容混乱、城关区群众中流传着一种思想：“地多是封建，财富是尾巴”。“割了麻露出茬，打倒地主恐怕就挨上了咱”。经过思想检查，一共就有卅九户（大部为中农）对填平政策恐慌。中农李海珍，认为今年喂猪长下一万元钱，也成了“尾巴”准备向群众献款。领导上发觉后，使群众展开自由讨论，使农民明确认识了封建剥削才是封建尾巴，解除了大部中农的顾虑。有些贫雇农不觉悟，注意启发他们起来诉苦斗争。雇农孙小三经过诉苦算账，回忆起他三辈子给地主受苦的情景，打破了以往觉得斗争地主实在凄惶的思想，揭发出地主隐藏在墙头的财产，变成了积极分子。贫农陈三蛮、宋中文等，一向不吭气，在群众斗争行动中消除了命运思想，他们自觉的站在主人翁地位团结全体农民，向城关地主陈三样展开了联合斗争取得了胜利。根据群众不同思想情况，把思想发动贯穿到每个行动中。
