(Our newspaper's dispatch from the second district of Jilu Yu) The land reform in Yanggu Sixth District's Xiaomi Zhazhen Village has been distributing [land] based on struggle, greatly satisfying the masses. This village is a newly liberated area. The Peasants' Association has been established in both the front and back villages. In the past half-month, the back village has struggled against three landlords and two traitors, obtaining 7,918 catties of grain, 8,790 catties of firewood, and furniture and items worth 205,930 yuan (in foreign currency). The front village struggled against two traitors and one landlord, obtaining 8,371 catties of grain, 5,353 catties of firewood, and furniture and items worth 56,000 yuan (in foreign currency). The front and back villages together obtained 632 mu of land. The distribution of the fruits of struggle has the following characteristics: First, the practice of distributing immediately after struggle has greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the masses. The back village fired the first shot of the land-returning-home movement. On the day of the victorious struggle against Sun Yukun, a landlord who colluded with traitors, more than thirty male and female peasants immediately received a bag of grain each. The masses excitedly said, "This time, we can be considered to have truly turned over!" Second, the distribution followed the opinions of the majority of the masses, not mechanically adhering to the old methods. The distribution of the fruits of struggle in both the front and back villages was first discussed by each group and then approved at the members' congress. The front village's method of distribution was divided into three classes: the landless poor and the particularly active poor peasants were in the first class, receiving 150 catties of grain; the general poor peasants were in the second class, receiving 120 catties of grain; and the middle peasants were in the third class, receiving 100 catties of grain. In the back village, the debate was fierce during the group discussions. One opinion was that the poor and the rich should not be distributed the same amount; another opinion was, "The poor people have land to divide, but the middle peasants get nothing. If they can't get some grain, we can't just keep calling them to meetings." The result of the discussion was an equal distribution. Because this distribution was only of floating wealth, the majority of the members were poor peasants, and most of the poor peasants agreed with this method of distribution.

　　阳谷小迷村分浮财
    随斗随分群众满意
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】阳谷六区小迷轧阵村土地改革随斗随分群众满意。该村是新解放区，前后两个庄都成立了农会，半月来后庄上斗争了三家地主，两家汉奸获得果实粮七千九百一十八斤，柴草八千七百九十斤，家具物品折洋廿万伍千九百三十元。前庄斗了两家汉奸一家地主，获得果实粮食八千三百七十一斤，柴五千三百五十三斤，物品家具折洋五万六千元，前后庄共得到土地六百三十二亩。分果实有以下几个特点：一、随斗随分群情特别高涨，后庄打开土地还家运动的第一炮，是清算勾结汉奸的地主孙玉坤斗争胜利当天，三十多个男女农民、立即都分到了一布袋粮食，群众兴奋的说：“这次可算是翻身啦”。二、听从多数群众的意见，不机械的按老一套办法来分。前后庄的果实分配、都是先由各小组讨论，然后在会员大会上通过。前头庄的分法是三等，没地的赤贫和特别积极的贫农是一等，分粮一五○斤；一般的贫农是二等，分一二○斤；中农为三等，分一百斤。后庄在小组讨论的时候，争论得很厉害，一种意见是贫的富的不能一样分；一种意见是“穷人有地分，中农摊不着；人家粮食再捞不到些，不能光叫人家开会”。讨论的结果是平均分了。因为此次分果实，只是分浮财，会员大多数是贫农，而贫农多数同意此分法。
