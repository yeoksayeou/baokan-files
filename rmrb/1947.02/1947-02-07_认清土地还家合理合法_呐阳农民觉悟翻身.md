Recognizing Land Return as Reasonable and Legal
	Nayang Peasants in Jibei Awaken and Overturn Their Fate

[Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 3rd Dispatch] Nayang in Jibei was originally a blank slate village. This time, land reform created a mass movement within five or six days. Now, the main experiences are introduced as follows:

1.  Conducting vigorous propaganda to rationalize and legalize land reform in the minds of the masses. This is the first task after entering the village. The propaganda emphasizes: A. The victory against Chiang and the news of preparing for a counter-offensive to break the "change of dynasty" thinking. B. The propaganda of "land returning home" explains that "suffering from hunger and cold is all because there is no land to cultivate. The land is reclaimed by the poor, the trees are planted by the poor, and it is right to take back the land." “Having two more mu of land can support a family; you won’t have to worry about food and clothing". "Land return home is a decree; the military and civilians must implement it". "Land returning home is reasonable and legal". The method of propaganda is large meetings and small discussions. In this way, open brewing is carried out in various villages, so that reactionary thoughts dare not raise their heads.

2.  Understand the concerns of the masses and grasp their demands. An old man said, "I haven't had land for eight generations. This year, I was given land, and I can marry a wife for my nephew." Some people said, "Just dividing the land is not enough to quench the immediate thirst. The New Year is coming soon, it would be good to get some food to eat." Asking for food and land are the two major demands of the peasants. Further understanding revealed that the masses were afraid of the landlords. It was decided to support the masses and propose "asking for food and land to have a good year." A poor people's meeting was convened, and at the same time, an administrative meeting was convened for the landlords, explaining that the decree must be implemented, and violators will be punished, and those who are enlightened will be taken care of. In this way, the stone was removed from the masses, and the masses moved.

3.  Combining administrative power with in-depth mobilization, convene a poor people's meeting, guiding everyone to speak out their suffering and recall the past, and encouraging the will to fight. Then concentrate efforts to increase wages for hired laborers, adopting a swarming approach. The masses' slogan is "Village helps village, neighbor helps neighbor, poor people of the world help poor people." More than 200 people chanted slogans and paraded on the streets, and the masses were in high spirits. A poor peasant who was bought by the landlord said, "It's too shameful to ask for land like this. Secretly asking for it will make people look down on you." At this time, seize the opportunity to distribute food and land, and the morale of the masses will quickly improve.

[Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 3rd Dispatch] After Jibei County's 5th, 6th, and 7th districts broke the ice, land has been returning home one after another. Since the merger of Jibei and Shushan Special Districts, the three districts have been mobilized one after another from December to early January, and the masses are preparing to carry out land distribution work after the lunar new year. In half a month, the masses in more than 20 villages received more than 130,000 catties of wheat. At the enlarged county party committee meeting on January 19th, the movement in the past half month was estimated to have partially broken the ice. The experience is: 1. Break the masses' "change of dynasty" thinking and dispel the masses' concerns, publicize the victory, and pursue the roots of poverty. 2. Concentrate firepower to break the masses' timidity and support the masses. 3. In action, attention should be paid to active elements mastering leadership, and not be mastered by hooligan elements.

    认清土地还家合理合法
    呐阳农民觉悟翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】济北呐阳原是个白板村，这次土地改革在五六天内造成了群众性的运动，现把几点主要经验介绍于下：开展有力的宣传，把土地改革在群众思想中合理合法化，这是进村后的第一个工作。宣传中强调：甲、反蒋胜利和准备反攻的消息，打破变天思想；乙、宣传土地还家说明“受饿受冻都是因为没地种，地是穷人开，树是穷人栽，要回土地是应该。”，“有上二亩可拉头（地），穿衣吃饭不发愁”，“土地还家是法令，军民一律要执行”，“土地还咱家，合理又合法”，宣传的方法是大会讲、小会谈，这样一来在各村公开酝酿，使反动思想不敢抬头。二、了解群众顾虑，掌握群众要求。一位老头说：“八辈子没有地了，今年分了地，给俺侄娶个媳妇”。有一部分人说：“光分地，远水不解近渴，快到年啦，弄点粮食吃才好。”要粮要地是农民的两大要求。进一步又了解到群众怕地主。决定给群众撑腰提出“要粮要地过好年”，召开穷人大会，同时用行政力量召开地主会，说明法令必须执行，违犯者受处分，开明者一定照顾。这样一来，给群众搬去了石头，群众便动起来。三、行政力量和深入动员相结合，召开穷人大会，引导着大家诉苦进行回忆，鼓励斗争意志。接着便集中力量给雇工增资，采用了一窝蜂上门的办法，群众的口号是“村帮村、邻帮邻、天下穷人帮穷人。”二百多人呼着口号，在街上游行示威，群众情绪很高。一个被地主收买的贫农说：“这样要地多光面，偷偷的要了落个被人看不起”，这时抓紧分粮分地，群众的情绪很快提高。
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】济北县五六七区轰开局面后，土地纷纷还家。自济北和蜀山特别区合并后，自十二月至一月初，三个区先后都动起来，群众准备在阴历年后即进行分地工作。半个月中有二十余村群众共得麦子十三万多斤。在一月十九日扩大县委会上对这半个月的运动，估计是局部的突开了局面，经验是：一、打破群众“变天”思想与解除群众的顾虑，宣传胜利，追穷根。二、集中火力打破群众的胆怯，给群众撑腰。三、在行动中要注意积极分子掌握领导权，不要为流氓坏分子掌握。
