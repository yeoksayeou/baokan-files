    Taihang Second Special District Plans for Organ Production
    Achieving Full Self-Sufficiency in Agricultural and Sideline Handicraft Products and Public Miscellaneous Vegetable Funds
    [This newspaper Taihang News] The Taihang Second Special District has summarized organ production and proposed taking agriculture and sideline handicrafts as this year's production direction. On January 27, all personnel of the district office held a meeting to summarize last year's organ production. The harvest of vegetables alone was more than 30,000 jin; production models such as Qiao Zhaoxiang were selected and rewarded on the spot. Subsequently, this year's production issues were raised. Secretary Feng called on everyone to engage in production and practice economy to solve their own difficulties, reduce the burden on the people, and support the patriotic self-defense war. Then, the overall production task for this year was set, planning for 7 million yuan in cash and 80,000 jin of vegetables, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in public miscellaneous expenses and vegetable funds. The specific approach is: to open up 50 mu of land and invite experienced farmers to guide technology, with all organ personnel participating in labor. There is a textile factory in Zuoquan city, where handicrafts will be developed, and organ staff and their families will be absorbed to participate, solving their livelihood problems through production. Each person will produce 200 jin of vegetables for the public; by knitting clothes and socks, raising chickens and pigs, each person will accumulate 10,000 yuan in production throughout the year, ensuring no commercial activity.

    太行二专署计划机关生产
    经营农副手工业公杂菜金全自给
    【本报太行讯】太行二专署总结机关生产，提出以农副手工业为今年生产方针。元月二十七日全署人员开会总结去年机关生产。光蔬菜即收获三万余斤；选出生产模范乔兆祥等二人，当场奖励。随提出今年生产问题。冯秘书主任号召：要做到人人生产，个个节约，解决自己困难，减轻人民负担，支持爱国自卫战争。继订出今年总生产任务，计划现金七百万元，菜八万斤，做到公杂费和菜金等自给。具体作法是：开地五十亩，请老农指导技术，机关人员全体参加劳作。在左权城内有纺织工厂一座，一面发展手工业，一面吸收机关干属参加，从生产中解决她们的生活问题，每人生产二百斤菜交公；打衣织袜、养鸡喂猪，达到每人全年生产积蓄一万元，保证不搞商业。（法彰）
