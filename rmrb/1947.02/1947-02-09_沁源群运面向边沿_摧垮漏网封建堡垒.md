    Qinshui Mass Movement Faces the Periphery: Destroying the Feudal Strongholds That Slipped Through the Net
    [Report from Taiyue, this paper, 6th] Qinshui, after five years of mass movement, discovered Beixin Village, a village completely ruled by feudal forces. The village's feudal landlords and local tyrants, Duan Ge Tang, Duan Bao Tian, and Duan Xue Tian, known as the "Two Tigers and One Eagle," posed as middle peasants and manipulated the government over the years, deceiving superiors and subordinates in all their work. To resist tenant farmers' demands for land, they revised the reasonable burden laws. For example, tenant farmer Liu Ge Jing spent five years accumulating money to buy seven mu of land from landlord Duan Xiu Sheng. When the land was in Duan's hands, the burden was eight dou per mu, but when it came into Liu's hands, it was changed to one shi two dou five sheng per mu. Liu Ge Jing could not afford it and had to reluctantly sell the land. After the land reform in the core areas of the county was completed, the leadership concentrated its efforts on the backward areas on the periphery, discovered the Beixin Village problem, and then conducted deliberations and convened mass meetings. At the beginning, the masses did not dare to speak out and only gossiped in private: the cadres were communicating with the "Two Tigers and One Eagle" to see if their thinking was aligned. After education and deliberation, the deceived cadres became aware and together exposed the crimes of the "Two Tigers and One Eagle," launching a struggle and cutting off the tail of feudal politics and economics. The peasants of Beixin Village were emancipated.

    沁源群运面向边沿
    摧垮漏网封建堡垒
    【本报太岳六日电】经过五年群众运动的沁源，发现一个完全被封建势力统治的村子北辛庄。该村封建地主、恶霸段戈唐、段宝田、段学田，号称“二虎一雕”冒充中农，历年来操纵政权，任何工作瞒上欺下。为抵制佃户要田，修改合理负担法令，如佃户刘圪靖五年积蓄点钱，买下地主段秀升七亩地，在段手时每亩负担八斗，到刘手时，便改为每亩一石二斗五升，刘圪靖无法负担，只得忍痛将地出卖。当全县腹心地区土地改革完成后，领导上便集中力量，面向边沿的落后区，发现了北辛庄问题，随即进行酝酿与召开群众大会，开始时群众还不敢发言，只有背地里闲谈：干部与“二虎一雕”通气，先看看他们的思想通了没有。经过教育酝酿，被骗的干部觉悟，一同揭破“二虎一雕”的罪恶，掀起了斗争，割掉了封建政治经济尾巴，北辛庄农民翻了身。
