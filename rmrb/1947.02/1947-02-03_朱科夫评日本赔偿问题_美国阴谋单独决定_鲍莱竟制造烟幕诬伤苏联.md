[News Report] According to TASS, Moscow, January 29th: "News" recently published Zhukov's commentary on Japan's reparations issue. The article states: In December 1946, the US State Department released to the press a document titled "Part of the Report of US Reparations Commissioner Pauley." This "part of the report" is filled with deliberate anti-Soviet rumors and absurd attacks.

The publication of Pauley's slanderous report proves that certain Americans not only persist in trying to hinder the correct resolution of the reparations issue but also resort to despicable means. In his report, Pauley estimates the losses suffered by Manchurian industry during the "Soviet occupation" at $885 million. Some Kuomintang newspapers published in Changchun "supplemented" this figure to $900 million. They used this method to distort the following facts: The Soviet army, which defeated the Kwantung Army in fierce battles, seized the following war trophies: weapons and military supplies, as well as some industrial equipment and materials used by the Japanese army for war purposes. According to the most generous estimates of the qualified Soviet authorities, the industrial equipment that formed part of its war trophies was worth only $95 million. Conscious that his slanderous report was completely superficial, Pauley immediately made another provocative "inference," namely that the actions of the Chinese Communist Party after the withdrawal of the Soviet army caused even greater losses to certain industrial sectors. In his report, Pauley also said that the continuing internal struggles are the main factor hindering the economic recovery of Manchuria. So, we can ask: What does this have to do with the Soviet Union and the reparations issue? Is it the Soviet army or the army of another powerful country that is stationed on Chinese territory and participating in or helping to expand the civil war? One can agree with Pauley that in those areas of China where war is continuing or threatened, reconstruction work cannot be accomplished. The quickest way to eliminate these situations is to completely end the Chinese civil war instigated by imperialist interference in China's internal affairs, withdraw foreign troops stationed in China, and implement a program of genuine democratic reform in the country. In fact, Pauley is not very concerned about the recovery of war-torn areas in China. The purpose of his report is different, namely to create a smokescreen that will help the United States implement its reparations policy, which completely disregards the interests of other allied powers that participated in defeating Japanese imperialism. As is well known, the Allied powers established a special body, the Far Eastern Commission, to formulate their policies towards defeated Japan. It includes representatives of all countries that participated in the war against Japan, and therefore it can formulate policies that reflect the common opinions of all countries concerned, rather than the opinions of any one country. The Far Eastern Commission is capable of handling all matters relating to the Japanese mainland and reparations, including the disposal of Japanese property on Japanese islands. The Reparations Committee, established as a subsidiary body of the Far Eastern Commission, completed important preliminary work in drafting a temporary Japanese reparations plan in 1946. Many of the documents prepared by the committee were unanimously adopted by the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, it seemed natural that the Far Eastern Commission could break the deadlock on Japanese reparations in order to quickly destroy Japan's war economic potential and monopolize concerns for general peace and security. However, instead of making the most reasonable use of this opportunity, some people attempted to divert the Far Eastern Commission from discussing the actual reparations issue and instead tried to discuss Japan's so-called "foreign assets" (in other words, Japanese investment abroad) in the name of discussing war trophies. This issue is absolutely not within the scope of the Far Eastern Commission's discussion. Behind Pauley's slanderous rumors about the Soviet Union's "unilateral actions" in Manchuria, the US authorities are preparing to violate inter-allied agreements and truly "resolve" the reparations issue unilaterally. Japanese newspapers have systematically and continuously disseminated Associated Press reports about the United States' decision to immediately begin obtaining reparations from Japan, even without the full consent of the Soviet Union and other wartime allies. Undoubtedly, such reports will be welcomed by the Japanese reactionary camp. The un-disarmed Japanese militarists and the giants of the Japanese monopoly groups will strive to gain the greatest benefit from the lack of coordination among the Allied powers on Japan, especially on the issue of reparations. One can see this from some of the facts that have already been revealed. For example, as is well known, in the period from June to August 1946, the list of Japanese factories to be relocated for reparations published by MacArthur Headquarters included 1,090 mechanical enterprises. As a result of repeated revisions and "corrections" of these lists by the US military authorities, this number had fallen to 934 by the end of 1946. Which factories were affected by this reduction? 334 of the 447 aircraft factories, 235 of the 273 private munitions factories, and 43 of the 49 refineries remained on the list. The extremely shocking fact is that 24 of the aircraft factories removed from the reparations list were located underground. This behavior very clearly reveals an unwillingness to fully extract reparations from Japan in strict accordance with the Potsdam Declaration of the Allied powers, in order to ensure Japan's complete demobilization and the destruction of its war economic potential. Apart from those who dream of a new war, who can benefit most from this reparations policy other than the owners of Japanese military industries and various adventurers? This situation is certainly not in the interests of peace and security in the Far East. Obviously, the issue of fair Japanese reparations, which is not only necessary to compensate for the losses caused by Japanese aggression but also as a means of disarming Japan economically, cannot be satisfactorily resolved by unilateral actions of the US occupying authorities.

　　朱科夫评日本赔偿问题
    美国阴谋单独决定
    鲍莱竟制造烟幕诬伤苏联
    【本报讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：消息报顷发表朱科夫关于日本赔偿问题之评论。论文称：一九四六年十二月美国务院曾向报界发布“美国赔偿委员鲍莱报告之一部分”的文件，此“报告之一部分”充溢着反苏的有意之谣言与荒谬之攻击。
    鲍莱诽谤性的报告之发表，证明某些美国人士不但坚持着努力来阻碍正确的达到赔偿问题之解决，而且还采用着卑鄙的手段。在日报告中，鲍莱估计在“苏维埃占领”期间的满洲工业所受之损失为八万万八千五百万美元。某些在长春出版的国民党报纸“补足”此数为九万万美元。他们用这种办法曲解着下述之真实情况，即在激烈战斗中击溃关东军的苏军取得了如下之战利品：武器和军需品以及一部分为日本军队作战争之用的工业设备与材料。依照有资格的苏联当局最宽大的估计，形成其战利品一部分的工业设备仅值九千五百万美元。鲍莱自觉他的诽谤性之报告是完全浅薄的，于是立即作出了另一个挑拨性的“推断”，即自苏军撤退后，中国共产党之行动造成了某些工业部门更重大之损失。在他的报告中，鲍莱还说：内部继续不已的斗争为妨碍满洲经济复兴的主要因素。那么，我们就可以发问：这与苏联及赔偿问题又有什么关系呢？驻留在中国领土上而且参加内战或帮助扩大内战的难道是苏联的而不是另一强大国家的军队吗？人们可以同意鲍莱的这个说法，在中国那些正继续战争或有战事威胁的地区，复员工作是不能有所成就的。消除这些情形的最捷门径就在于：彻底终止为帝国主义干涉中国内政所鼓动的中国内战，撤退外国驻华军队，在该国实现真正的民主改革的纲领。其实，中国遭受战争摧毁地区的恢复问题对于鲍莱是无甚烦扰的。他这个报告的目的是别有所在，其目的乃欲放出烟幕，这烟幕会帮助美国实行其完全不顾其他曾参加击溃日本帝国主义之同盟强国利益的赔偿政策。如所周知，同盟强国为了制定其对战败的日本之政策，曾成立特别机关——远东委员会，其中有一切曾参加对日作战之国家的代表，并且因此它能制定反映一切有关各国之共同意见而不是其中任何一国之意见的政策。远东委员会是能处理一切有关日本本部领土和包括直至关涉到处理日本岛屿上日人财产的赔偿之问题的。作为远东委员会之附属机关而成立的赔偿委员会，在一九四六年已完成草拟日本暂时赔偿计划之重要的初步工作。该委员会所制备的文件许多均经远东委员会一致通过。因此，远东委员会曾能打开关于日本赔偿的僵局，似属自然，这赔偿是为了较快地摧毁日本战争经济潜力和独占康来恩以利一般的和平与安全。但是有人却不最合理地利用这个时机，反而企图转移远东委员会不讨论实际的赔偿问题，而强欲借名讨论日本的所谓“国外资产”（换言之即日人在国外之投资）问题，以讨论战利品问题。这个问题是绝对地不在远东委员会讨论范围之内的。在鲍莱关于苏联在满洲“单方面行动”之诽谤造谣的烟幕后面，美国当局正准备违反盟国间协议，把赔偿问题真的单方面“解决”。日本报纸有系统地连续地传布美联社的报导——关于美国立刻开始甚至无苏联与其他战时同盟国之完全同意，即自日本取得赔偿之决定。无疑地，此种报导将受到日本反动阵营的欢迎。未解除武装的日本军阀和日本垄断集团的巨头们，将竭力自同盟国对日特别是对赔偿问题态度的缺乏协调中取得最大利益。人们可以从某些已显露的事实看出这点。譬如，如众所知，在一九四六年六月至八月的阶段中，麦克阿瑟总部所发表的因为赔偿而需迁移的日本工厂名单，包括一○九○家机械企业。由于美国军事当局反复修订和“改正”这些名单的结果，到一九四六年底此数字已降至九三四家。什么工厂受到这个削减的影响了呢？四四七家飞机工厂中有三三四家，二七三所私营军火工厂中有二三五所，四九所制炼所中有四三所留在名单上。极端惊人的事实是自赔偿名单取消飞机工厂中有二十四家均系设于地下。此种行为十分显然地泄露出不愿充分依照同盟强国波茨顿宣言之赔款严格地自日本索取赔偿，以保证日本之完全复员及摧毁战争经济潜力。除了是梦想新战争，日本军事工业所有者们和各类冒险家们，谁能由这种赔偿政策首先获得利益呢？这种情势是一定不符合于远东和平与安全之利益的。显然，不但必须赔偿日本侵略所致之损失，而且也作为解除日本经济武装上手段之日本的公平赔偿问题，不能惬意地由美占领当局单方面的行动来解决。
