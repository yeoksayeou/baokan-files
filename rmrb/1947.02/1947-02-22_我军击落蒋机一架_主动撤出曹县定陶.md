　　Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th: The People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Cao County and Dingtao on the 16th. Several Chiang planes strafed during the Cao County battle, and one was shot down by the People's Liberation Army. The 5th Army and the 85th Division of the Chiang army occupied Cao County and Dingtao. The 5th Army is the main force of the Chiang army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, originally intended to advance into southern Hebei, based along the Puyang-Qingfeng-Nanle line. When Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng planned to attack southern Shandong, they transferred the army back to the Longhai Railway, Shangqiu-Kaifeng line, attempting to coordinate and reinforce the attack on southern Shandong. At the beginning of the month, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared on both sides of the Longhai Railway and successively recovered seven county towns including Suixian and Qixian, controlling 70 li of the Longhai Railway's Minquan-Shangqiu section, seriously threatening the advance on various liberated areas in southern Shandong. Therefore, the Chiang army's 5th Army and others launched an attack on Cao County, Suixian, Chengwu, Dingtao, and other places in southwestern Shandong, aiming to reduce the threat of the main force in this area. This area is precisely where the troops of Mi Wenhe and Liu Ruzhen were defeated and annihilated not long ago.

　　我军击落蒋机一架
    主动撤出曹县定陶
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十日电】人民解放军于十六日主动撤出曹县定陶两城。曹县之役蒋机数架掩护扫射，被解放军击落一架。侵占曹县定陶两城者为蒋军第五军及八十五师等部。按第五军为冀鲁豫蒋军主力，原为向冀南进犯，盘据于濮阳清丰南乐一线，蒋介石、陈诚布置向鲁南进攻之时，即将该军调回陇海路商邱开封一线，企图策应增援向鲁南之进攻。月初冀鲁豫人民解放军突出现于陇海路南北两侧，并连续收复睢县、杞县等七座县城，控制陇海路民权商邱段七十华里，严重威胁进犯鲁南解放区各地，是由蒋军第五军等部向鲁西南曹县、睢县、城武、定陶等地之进攻，目的即在于减除这一带的主力威协，这原是解放区正是不久的米文和刘汝珍等部遭受覆没与歼灭打击之场所。
