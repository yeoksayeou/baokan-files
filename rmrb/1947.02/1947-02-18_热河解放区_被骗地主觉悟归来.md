Xinhua News Agency, Jireliao, 13th – In the Rehe Liberated Area, a small number of landlords who were deceived into fleeing have awakened and returned. Wang Lelin, a fleeing landlord from Xin Yi District, personally admitted his mistakes to the democratic government after returning. The government comforted him and stated that they would not hold his past actions against him. Five households of fleeing landlords have returned to Chengbei Qi District. The government convened a symposium for them, explained various policies, and encouraged them to resume production at home. Some time ago, fleeing landlords in the Chiang-occupied areas, unable to bear the oppression of the tyranny, are preparing to return. A landlord who fled to a certain district of Chaoyang last spring with his entire family of seventy-nine people due to believing rumors spread by special agents, had seven family members conscripted. He recently sent a letter to the democratic government, expressing his desire to return to the Liberated Area. The democratic government immediately replied, welcoming his return.

    被骗地主觉悟归来
    【新华社冀热辽十三日电】热河解放区少数被骗逃亡地主纷纷觉悟归来，新意一区逃亡地主，王乐林回来后，亲至民主政府承认错误，政府备加抚慰，并说明不咎既往。城北七区回来了五户逃亡地主，政府召集他们开座谈会，解释各项政策，鼓励他们按家生产。前些时在蒋占区的逃亡地主，因不堪暴政压迫，均准备回来。去年春天因误信特务造谣带着全家七十九口人逃亡朝阳×区之地主，七口人被抓作壮丁，近寄信民主政府，表示要回解放区，民主政府当即复信欢迎其归来。
