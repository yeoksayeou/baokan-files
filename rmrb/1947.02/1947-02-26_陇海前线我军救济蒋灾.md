　　Our Army on the Longhai Front Provides Relief to Victims of Chiang Kai-shek's Disasters
　　[This newspaper, JiluYu Front, 25th dispatch] The Eighth Route Army provides relief to victims of Chiang Kai-shek's disasters in the newly liberated areas. Long Fuquan, a platoon leader of our army in a certain unit, was conducting mass work in ××ji along the Longhai railway line. He discovered that the Liu and Wang families in the village had been emptied by looting from Chiang Kai-shek's army, leaving three old ladies without clothes or food. Mrs. Liu's son had been captured by Chiang Kai-shek's army to serve as a soldier, and the family was reduced to beggars. After Platoon Leader Long returned to the platoon, he launched a campaign to provide relief to victims of Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. The entire platoon donated sixteen pieces of clothing, four pairs of shoes, three towels, three pairs of socks, two thousand yuan in cash, and eighteen catties of millet, and immediately sent people to express their condolences. The masses said, "The Central Army comes to rob things and conscript soldiers, while the Eighth Route Army comes to deliver rice and clothes." They were extremely moved. Also, when the Fourth Company of a certain unit was stationed in Macun Village, a soldier named Xu Desheng saw an old lady crying in a room during the day. After inquiring, he learned that her clothing and utensils had been completely looted or destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's army. The two soldiers immediately donated one thousand yuan each to provide relief. Currently, the unit is universally launching a campaign to provide relief to victims of Chiang Kai-shek's disasters in the recovered areas.
　　[This newspaper, JiluYu Front, 24th dispatch] Our good supply cadres are voluntarily donating money and grain to relieve the masses in the recovered areas who had previously been helped by the generals. Zhang Chungong from Wanglou Village in × county is the director of the farmers' association, and his eldest son works at the supply station. When Chiang Kai-shek's army invaded, Zhang Chungong also participated in the supply station. At this time, the landlords seized grain and land, and his daughter-in-law was forced to hang herself, leaving behind three young children who cried every day and could only eat some sweet potatoes when they were hungry. After our unit entered the village and discovered this matter, the supply department's correspondent was moved to tears. Several cadres then voluntarily donated money. They believed that it was easy for ten people to save one person. Chief Fu, Section Chief Zhang, Deputy Section Chief Liu, and Deputy Political Instructor Zhang each donated 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Section Chief Zhang and everyone also saved a month's worth of allowance rice and sent it to his family. Coincidentally, Zhang Chungong and his son also arrived and were deeply moved by the scene. They only stopped for two hours before returning to work in the unit.

　　陇海前线我军救济蒋灾
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十五日电】八路军在政复区救济蒋灾。某部我军排长龙富泉在陇海沿线××集进行群众工作，发现该村刘王两家被蒋军抢夺已空，三位老太太无衣无食，刘老太太的儿子被蒋军抓走当兵，家中流为乞丐。龙排长长已回到排里，发动救济蒋灾。全排共捐出衣服十六件、鞋子四双、毛巾三条、袜子三双、现钞二千元，小米十八斤，即派人前往慰问。群众说：“中央军来抢东西，抓丁，八路军来送米、送衣。”极为感动。又某部四连在马村驻军时，战士徐德生白天见到一位老太太在房内哭叫。问明后，知其衣物用具被蒋军全部抢去或打毁。该二战士当时各捐出一千元，予以救济。现该部队在收复区普遍发动救蒋灾。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线廿四日电】我供给好干部自动捐募钞粮，救济收复区会曾被将军救济的群众。×县王楼张春功是农会主任，大儿在兵站工作。当蒋军侵犯时，张春功亦参加了兵站。这时地主夺粮夺地，媳妇被迫上吊而死，留下三个小孩子，天天啼哭，饿了只能吃点的山芋。我部进入该村，发现此事后，首先供给处通讯员激动的哭了，于是几个干部自动募捐，他们认为十人救一人容易，傅处长、张股长、刘副股长、张副政指每人捐出法币两千元，张股长和大家又一次节约了一个月的津贴米送给他家。可巧张春功和他儿子亦赶来，看见这样情形，十分感动，只停了两个钟头就又返部工作去了。
