    US Proposes Draft for Exclusive Control of Japanese Islands
    Insisting on Inclusion in Security Council Agenda
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st – Reports from various sources: Disregarding the opposition of the British and Australian governments, the US delegation to the UN submitted a trusteeship agreement draft on the 17th to UN Secretary-General Lie for Pacific islands currently occupied by the US military, and requested that this draft be included in the Security Council agenda. According to reports: "The American draft stipulates that in these areas, the United States is the sole country responsible for administration, and allows for the establishment of fortifications in certain areas, which are also considered 'restricted zones,' off-limits to other countries. The areas referred to in the American draft are all former Japanese mandated territories before the war, totaling one thousand five hundred small islands and coral reefs, including the three major island groups of the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and Caroline Islands. The Security Council is about to handle the 'trusteeship agreement for strategic areas' for the first time. The UN Charter stipulates that the handling of such trusteeship agreements falls within the jurisdiction of the council.
