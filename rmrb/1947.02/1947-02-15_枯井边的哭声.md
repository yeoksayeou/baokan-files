    Cries by the Dry Well
    Ying Nan

    This reporter followed the army into the liberated Zhongyang City on December 12th of last year. Amidst the joyful atmosphere, a discordant, miserable cry suddenly arose. I followed the sound to the southwest corner of the city, to a dry well beside a raised mound of yellow earth. I saw a group of elderly, weak, women and children, beating their chests and weeping. This dry well was the pit of sin where Yan Xishan slaughtered the people. The old people all knew that the well was nineteen "zhang" deep, but when measured with a rope now, it was only eight "zhang". The space below was filled with over two hundred corpses. White-haired old women cried for their sons, young women cried for their husbands, sons cried for their fathers. Old man Wang Hongzhi, with tears in his eyes, stamped his feet and shouted, "I want revenge!" His home was in Pangjia Village, five "li" north of the city. His eldest son, Wang Bingsheng, his second son, Wang Jihu, who was fifteen years old, and his son-in-law, Li Juhua, were all thrown into this dry well by Yan's army. At the time, Yan's army wanted his son, Wang Bingsheng, to admit "I am a 八路军 [Eighth Route Army] worker," and subjected him to torture such as force-feeding with chili water, the tiger bench, and inserting red-hot iron rods into his anus. After the tortured son's hands and feet were crippled, he, Wang Jihu, and Li Juhua were all tied with their hands behind their backs, their mouths stuffed with cotton, and thrown into the dry well at night. In July of last year, when Liu Yousheng from Qiaojia Village, five "li" from the city, was arrested and taken to the detention center, his son Liu Jindong came to deliver food. He received the reply that "your father has gone to Xi County to receive training." He was worried about his father's life, so he carried a manure basket and wandered around. Finally, he picked up one of his father's shoes by the dry well. With tears in his eyes, he glared at the dry well for a long time, but dared not speak out. He quietly tucked his father's shoe under his arm and ran back. The "secret of the dry well" was finally revealed by a prisoner. The families of the victims knew that their loved ones were in the well, but dared not speak out, nor dared to cry. After the liberation of Zhongyang, when they began to retrieve the bodies, the people who went down were unable to stand due to the dense stench in the well. They then switched to using a hook to retrieve them, pulling up a strange corpse with its head stuck to its arm. This was a person from a village eight "li" from the city. As soon as his family saw the corpse, they pointed at him and cried out, "Oh God!" He was arrested and brought into the city on June 16th of last year, and Yan's army filled him into the dry well the day before they retreated. The corpses were hooked up one by one and piled on the mound of yellow earth. More and more were constantly being brought up. The cries of "We want revenge" shook the mountains and the city.

    枯井边的哭声
    英南
    记者随军于去年十二月十二日进入解放了的中阳城，在欢欣鼓舞的气氛中，突然传出一种与此不谐调的凄惨的哭声，我循声走到城西南角，在隆起的黄土堆旁的枯井边，见到一群老弱妇孺，正在捶胸哭泣，这枯井便是阎锡山屠杀人民的罪窟。老年人都知道，井深十九丈，但现在用绳子量，只有八丈了，下面的空间，被二百多具尸体填满了。头发苍白的老太婆哭儿子，年青的妇女哭丈夫，儿子哭父亲。王宏智老汉老泪盈眶顿足高喊：“我要报仇！”他的家在城北五里的庞家会，大儿王炳升，十五岁的次儿王吉虎，和女婿李居好，都被阎军填进这眼枯井中。当时阎军为要他儿子王炳升承认：“我是八路军工作人员”，曾施以灌辣椒水、老虎凳、用火红的铁棍插入肛门等非刑，当被拷打的儿子手脚都受到残废后，他与王吉虎李居好都双手背缚口塞棉花，在夜里倒填进枯井中。去年七月，距城五里的乔家沟的刘有生被抓进看守所时，儿子刘金洞来送饭，得到“你父亲到隰县城受训去了有的回答，他担心父亲的生命，便背起粪筐到处游转，终于在枯井旁拣到父亲一只鞋，他含着泪怒视枯井良久，但不敢声张，悄悄地把父亲那只鞋挟在腋下，跑了回来。“枯井的秘密”终于被狱入泄露出来了，惨死者的家属明知亲人在井里，但不敢声张，也不敢哭。中阳解放后，开始打捞尸体时，下去的人都被井中浓厚的臭气薰的立不住脚。又改用吊勾打捞，拉上一具头上贴在臂膀上的怪尸，这是离城八里一个村子的人。他亲人一看见尸体，便用手指着他在哭叫“天呀！”他是去年六月十六被抓进城的，阎军退走的前一天才把他填进枯井。尸体一个个钩上来，堆在黄土堆上，下面不断的还往上运，“我们要报仇”的哭声，震撼了群山和城池。
