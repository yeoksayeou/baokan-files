Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 9th: The commercial trade between the newly liberated areas of Western Shanxi and the four liberated areas of Northwestern Shanxi, Taiyue, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is now unimpeded. Textiles from the Taiyue area, salt from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and pigs, sheep, hemp, oil, and wine from Northwestern Shanxi are flowing to each other. Pack animals carrying goods travel constantly along the roads. In just half a month, more than 100,000 jin of sesame oil were transported from Linxian and Lishi to Xixian for sale. Business firms in Xixian, which had suffered from the Yan army's exploitation and whose businesses had been bankrupted, have recently resumed operations one after another. In the past two months, the number of merchants in the county seat has increased from more than twenty to more than one hundred and thirty, a tenfold increase compared to the time of liberation. The 30-yard Dike Street is crowded with people all day long. The military-civilian cooperative's trade volume reached 200,000 yuan in three days during the Spring Festival, and prices have generally fallen by 50%.

    陕甘宁、晋西、晋西北、太岳连成一片
    商业贸易畅通
    隰县解放两月商贩增加十倍
    【新华社晋绥九日电】晋西新解放区与晋西北、太岳、陕甘宁，四解放区之商业贸易已畅通无阻。太岳区之布匹、陕甘宁边区之盐，及晋西北之猪、羊、麻、油、酒等，正源源互流。商运骡马络绎于途，仅从临县离石两地运销隰县之麻油，半月中即达十余万斤。过去遭受阎军苛榨，商业陷于破产之隰县商号，近已纷纷复业，该县城两月来商贩已由二十余户增到一百三十余户，较解放时增加十倍。卅咽堤街，终日人群拥挤不堪，军民合作社在春节三天中贸易额达二十余万元，物价普遍下降百分之五十。
