    Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shandong, 8th. At a symposium held on the 26th of last month by nearly a hundred people from all walks of life in Zaozhuang and representatives of the democratic government, Mr. Zhao Honglie, a mid-level employee of the Zhongxing Company, accused Chiang's troops of various acts of tyranny during their 101-day rule of Zaozhuang: Due to the harsh treatment of workers, more than 10,000 employees were unemployed; furthermore, the rampant issuance of legal tender caused prices to soar, making life miserable for the people. Even employed workers felt the difficulty of making a living. Director Du of the Zaozhuang Mining Area Office then spoke, explaining the steps taken by the liberated area's democratic government to restore work: First, solve the urgent problems, such as repairing the motors to get the lights on, so that the kilns can be opened and coal can be produced, allowing coal miners to be employed quickly. In addition, iron factories will be opened to employ skilled workers; other work will be carried out gradually. Subsequently, Director Liu of the Industry and Commerce Bureau put forward measures to stabilize prices. After the meeting, everyone expressed that the people and the democratic government would cooperate more closely in the future to strive for the restoration of production in the Zaozhuang coal mines.

    枣庄矿工受蒋军虐待重获解放后生活安定
    【新华社鲁南八日电】在上月二十六日枣庄各界人士及民主政府代表近百人的座谈会上，中兴公司中级职员赵鸿烈先生控诉蒋军统治枣庄一百零一天中的种种暴政：由于对工人之苛刻虐待，有一万多职工失业；更滥发法币，使百物昂贵，人民生活苦不堪言。即连一般在职工人，亦感生活困难。枣庄矿区办事处杜主任继起发言，说明解放区民主政府恢复工作进行的步骤：首先解决目前迫切问题，如先把电机修理好，使电灯发亮，方可开窑出炭，使炭工迅速就业。另外开办铁工厂，以使技工就业；其余工作当逐步进行。继由工商管理局刘局长对稳定物价问题提出办法。会后大家表示以后人民和民主政府将更密切合作，为恢复枣庄煤窑的生产而努力。
