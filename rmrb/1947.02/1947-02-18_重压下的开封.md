Kaifeng Under Heavy Pressure
    Hong
    Since the Kuomintang opened the pseudo "National Assembly," not only is there no "public opinion" or "freedom," but even the people's mouths have to be shut. The people of Kaifeng must look around when speaking normally, and if there are strangers, they avoid speaking, otherwise they are in danger of being arrested. Once, two escaped small landlords were doing petty business on the street. After being inspected by the police, they were scolded: "Damn it, get out! Get out!" and kicked twice. The two people swallowed their anger and whispered: "Hum! It's not as good as those people (referring to our liberated areas)!" They were immediately arrested and taken to the police station.
    The prices in Kaifeng are truly rising daily. White flour costs more than 600 yuan per jin, oil costs 2,600 yuan per jin, renting a room costs 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, taking a bath costs more than 2,000 yuan, and cloth costs 2,200 yuan per chi. An ordinary clerk's monthly income is only tens of thousands of yuan, making it difficult to maintain his own life, let alone support his family.
    The people's burden is increasing day by day. In the past, the Kuomintang announced a one-year exemption, but in less than half a year, it began collecting again. Not only were they collecting, but they also added various donations and taxes, several times higher than what should actually be paid. Coupled with the flood of American goods, the number of stores closing down in Kaifeng is increasing daily. As for the lives of the peasants, they are being squeezed to the point of death. Over the past year, the average yield per mu has been no more than 100 jin of cotton, one dan of grain, or eight dou of wheat, which can be sold for about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan at market prices. Selling all of this income is only enough to pay half of the taxes and levies. In recent years, a saying has secretly been circulating among the people: "The grain harvested from the land is not enough to pay the taxes, and the children raised by the wife are not enough for Old Chiang."
    But no matter how "strict" Chiang's rule is, the people demand peace and recognize the truth. The students of National Henan University in Kaifeng once requested the school to subscribe to three progressive newspapers: Xinhua Daily, Dagon Bao, and Wenhui Bao. The school only subscribed to one Wenhui Bao, which immediately caused student dissatisfaction, and they applied to the school to protest: "They are all Chinese newspapers, why can't we read them?"
    Regarding the incident of American soldiers raping female students in Beiping, all students in Kaifeng schools (except for three missionary schools) held a parade and demonstration of tens of thousands of people on January 3rd, despite various disturbances and suppressions from the authorities and secret agents. The streets were plastered with slogans such as: "Oppose American soldiers raping Chinese women!" and "Demand that American troops withdraw from China!" This could be considered a breath of fresh air under heavy pressure.

　　重压下的开封
    虹
    自国民党开了伪“国大”后，什么“民意”，什么“自由”，不但没有，而且连老百姓的嘴都要堵起来，在开封的人民，平时说话，必须四周看一看，若有生人，则避而不说，否则就有被捕的危险。有一次有两个逃亡小地主在街上做小贩，被警察检查过后，骂了一顿：“他妈的，滚开！滚开！”并被踢了两脚。那两人忍气吞声的小声说：“哼！不如人家（指我解放区而言）呢！”立刻就被抓到警察局里去。
    开封的物价，真正是一日数涨，白面每斤六百多元，油每斤二千六百元，住一间房子要两三万元，洗一次澡要二千多元，布每尺二千二百元，一个普通职员，每月的收入不过十几万元，很难维持自己一人的生活，更难说养活家小了。
    人民负担日益加重，过去国民党宣布免征一年，不到半年，又征实起来，不但征实，反而又加上了各种捐税，比实际应出的还高几倍，加上美货的滚滚侵入，现在开封市上的商店，倒闭的日渐增加。至于农民的生活，更是被压榨得奄奄一息了，一年来，一般每亩地平均可收棉花不过一百斤，收谷子不过一担，收麦子不过八斗，能合市价约七、八万元，将此收入完全卖尽，只能够交付出赋捐税的一半。年来在老百姓中秘密的流行着一句话：“地里打的粮食不够交款的，老婆养的孩子不够老蒋的。”
    但是不管蒋家统治如何“严密”，但人民是要求和平的，是认识真理的，在开封国立河南大学的学生，曾要求校方订阅新华日报、大刚报、文汇报三种进步报纸，而校方只给订了一份文汇报，当即引起学生不满，向校方申请抗议：“都是中国报纸，为什么我们不能看呢”？
    这次美兵强奸北平女生事件，开封各校学生（除三个教会学校外），全体学生，于一月三日在当局与特务的种种捣乱和压制下，进行了数万人的游行示威，大街上都贴满了：“反对美军强奸中国女人”！“要求美军撤出中国”等等标语算是在重压下透出了一口气来。
