Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th: Land reform in the rear of the Chiang-occupied area of Central Jiangsu has entered the review stage. Huian District in Qidong County completed the land review work before the Chinese New Year, enabling middle peasants to also develop during land reform. For example, in Production Village, before the review, households gaining land accounted for 50%, households giving up land accounted for 43%, and those who had to give up land accounted for 7%. In the initial review, 19 middle peasant households were compensated, totaling 2,300 *bu* of land (approximately 4 *mu* per 1,000 *bu*). This time, another 15 middle peasant households were compensated. The majority of middle peasants, due to renting land that has become their own, have also risen to become households gaining land, making households gaining land account for 90% of the entire village, and households giving up land only account for 10%. After the review, various townships successively held unity meetings, creating great unity in the countryside. Land reviews are also being conducted in some areas of Baoying County under tense conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning, 9th: Tianshan County in Rehe has completed land reform amidst the continuous harassment of Chiang's army and bandits. Except for a few occupied areas, a large amount of land in areas such as Wulan Hada and Wulan Chang has been distributed to peasants. The land reform in the county had undergone several twists and turns. When the democratic government was established in June last year and began to mobilize the masses, landlords spread rumors rampantly, and cadres did not pay enough attention, believing that land in Tianshan was worthless. The masses adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in the failure to implement land reform thoroughly. From June to early August, only over 100 *mu* of land were distributed throughout the county. In mid-August, when the county inspected the work, it put forward a work plan centered on solving the land problem. County-level cadres went to the countryside in person, concentrating the strength of district cadres to tackle this work. At that time, cadres did not have sufficient understanding, simply notified the farmers' association to solve the land problem, or only convened a meeting of farmers' association cadres, resulting in the land in the Wulan Hada district not being thoroughly resolved. Phenomena such as not allocating land foundations or secretly not dividing land despite nominally dividing it were still quite serious. After the county cadres conducted a second self-criticism in October and discovered the above situation, they straightened out the cadres' thinking and carried out a thorough review, which led to the current achievements.

    补偿中农损失农民大团结
    天山经过复查实现土地改革
    【新华社华中九日电】苏中蒋占区后方，土地改革进入复查阶段。启东县惠安区，于年关前完成土地复查工作，使中农在土地改革中亦得到发展，如生产村复查前得田户占百分之五十，出田户占百分之四十三，不得不出者占百分之七。初次复查补偿中农十九户，计田二千三百步（每千步为四亩），此次又补偿中农十五户，大部中农因租田变自田，也上升为得田户，使全村得田户占百分之九十，出田户仅占百分之十。各乡于复查后，相续举行团结大会，造成农村大团结。宝应部分地区亦在紧张情况下进行复查。
    【新华社冀热辽九日电】热河天山县，在抗击蒋军土匪不断骚挠中完成土地改革，除少数被占地区外，所有乌兰哈达、乌兰场等区，已有大量土地分给农民。该县土地改革曾几经曲折，去年六月建立民主政权开始发动群众时，地主大肆造谣，干部也重视不够，认为天山地不值钱，群众则抱观望态度，致使土地改革未能贯彻。六月至八月初，全县仅分配土地一百余亩。八月中旬，该县检查工作时，提出解决土地问题为中心的工作计划，县级干部亲身下乡，集中区干部力量突击这一工作，当时干部认识不够，简单通知农会解决土地问题，或者只召集农会干部开个会，致使乌兰哈达区土地未得到彻底解决，旧照不划地基或明分暗不分等现象仍相当严重。十月份经过县干部二次检讨发现上述情形，才打通干部思想，进行彻底复查工作，始获得现有成绩。
