    Report from a Pravda Correspondent
    [Dispatch from this newspaper] TASS Moscow, 7th: Pravda correspondent Yuri Zhukov, recently returned from the United States, wrote that as early as January, the American Economic Advisory Council submitted an ominous "New Year forecast" to President Truman. Experts acknowledged that, in general opinion, the foundation of current industrial activity is somewhat artificial, and declared that the reduction of production and the increase in unemployment cannot be prevented. The key point is that the height of price increases in the past five months has been equivalent to that of the fifteen months during the war, and the wages of ordinary Americans have fallen sharply since the abolition of overseas labor wages. On December 13, the Department of Labor issued a bulletin stating that the significant event of 1946 was the appearance of the highest price levels since World War I. Therefore, President Roosevelt passed a law prohibiting price increases and establishing a price control conference. After the war, this system collapsed under the attacks of the monopolists. Although 80 million head of livestock are being fed on ranches, long queues are forming everywhere, and meat has suddenly disappeared from all stores. Housewives smashed the windows of butcher shops and condemned the government. But when Truman abolished controls, meat reappeared everywhere at night...at double the price.
    American states are now building houses on a large scale, with over 100 million US dollars being invested in construction each month. Although, as Mayor Dewey admits, 750,000 New Yorkers are now homeless, I have never seen a completed house in New York with new tenants living in it. The new buildings have not been completed because rent control has not been lifted, and the Real Estate Owners Association decided in November to launch a rent increase campaign. Landlords are now making very high profits - about 100 million yuan a year, without spending a penny on repairs. Because of the lack of housing, people are willing to move into any slum. Last year in Chicago, people even used streetcars as residences (President Truman has declared that the United States now lacks five million homes, and only 500,000 homes cannot meet their basic needs). Many landlords prefer to leave their houses unfinished until rent control is lifted. Then they will be able to extort tenants as they please.
    In order to raise prices, an atmosphere of acute shortage of goods is essential. When customers see that goods are disappearing from the market, they will not care about the price. This simple profit-making technique allows large supplies to accumulate in warehouses. According to statistics from the Civilian Production Administration, these supplies have increased 4.5 times since 1945 and are valued at 3.4 billion US dollars, and now this figure is increasing by 100 million yuan per month. When sober businessmen are asked whether the accumulation of goods can be prevented or whether all the goods that are rotting and gathering dust can be utilized, they shake their heads worriedly. In 1944 (when prices were much lower than they are now), the University of California conducted an interesting study. Their calculations showed that the minimum annual requirement for a family of four was $2,964. However, according to recent materials published in American newspapers, 70 percent of American families do not have this minimum supply capacity. As for American workers, their situation is particularly miserable. 80 percent of American workers live below the subsistence level. It is not meaningless that Wall Street news agencies of American bankers have begun to talk about the threat of "overproduction," which means that in a very short period, when American capitalists see the actual possibility of not selling accumulated supplies, they may have to close factories, but this will indeed be the beginning of a terrible economic crisis. This omen makes Wall Street tycoons lose their peace of mind. Murray, chairman of the Industrial Union Federation, pointed out in his letter to the Economic Advisory Council that if the American production level drops to the expected level of 1944, considering the increased mechanization in the past few years, this will lead to the formation of 19 million unemployed people! Economists point out that if drastic measures are not taken, this decline in production levels will occur near the end of the year or in the summer of 1948. American newspapers have conveyed many reports that anti-labor legislation is being carried out in the United States to "suppress stubborn elements." At the same time, people who keenly pay attention to American public life should also be wary of such short reports, such as the exposure of the fascist group "Columbians" in Georgia, which was established in the image of Hitler's party; or the establishment of volunteer troops in New York. General Hu de Rome, who was appointed as the captain of the team, declared: The members of the team will be trained to "suppress serious domestic disturbances," which is commendable for his frankness. After this, the newspaper asked Dewey if he knew that this kind of army could easily become the core of American assault squads (referring to fascists)? Unfortunately, he did not answer.

### 美国经济的危机  真理报访员报导

    美国经济的危机
    真理报访员报导
    【本报讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：真理报访员尤里·朱可夫顷从美国归来著文称，早在一月，美国经济咨询会议即以不吉祥的“新年预测”呈交杜鲁门总统。专家们承认按照一般意见，现今的产业活动基础是有些人为的，而且宣称生产的减少和失业的增加未被阻止。要点是在于，过去五个月内物价上升之高度已如战时十五个月内上升者，而普通美国人的工资，从籍外劳动工资废止以来，已经剧烈下降。十二月十三日，劳工部发表布告谓：一九四六年显著的事，就是出现了第一次世界大战以来最高的物价水平。故罗斯福总统曾通过禁止提高物价和成立物价管制会议的法案。在战后，这制度在垄断者们的打击下崩溃。虽然八千万群牲口正在牧场上喂养着，到处形成漫长的行列，肉类却突然的从一切商店绝迹。主妇们打碎肉店里的窗子，而且谴责着政府。但当杜鲁门废止了管制以后，肉类又在晚上到处出现……而且是双倍价格。
    美国各州现正大量建造房屋，以使十万万余美元每月投入建筑，虽然像市长杜威所承认的，七十五万纽约人现在没有住所，但是我在纽约从未看见一所完成的房子有新租客住在里面。新的建筑未告成，因为房租管制未曾取消，和地产所有者协会曾在十一月决定发动涨租运动，房主现在正拿很高的利润——每年十万万元左右，而且不费一文去修补。因为缺少房屋，人们愿意搬入任何陋巷破屋。去年在支加哥人们甚至将电车用作居室（杜鲁门总统已宣称：美国现在缺少五百万家住所，而只有五十万户的住所，不能满足其基本需要）。许多房主宁愿让房屋不完整，直至房租管制取消为止。那时他们将能为所欲为地勒索租客。
    为了抬高物价，商品之急剧缺乏的空气是必然的。当顾客看到商品正自市场上绝迹时，他就不论价钱了。这种很简单的谋利技术放任大量供应中堆积在货栈中。根据民用生产局的统计，这些供应品自一九四五年以来已增加四·五倍，并且估价计为三百四十万万美元，而今此数字每月又增加十万万元。清醒的商业家被问到货物的堆积是否可以阻止或所有正在腐烂和积尘的货物是否能够利用时，他们忧虑地摇头。在一九四四年（该时物价比现今低的多）加利福尼亚大学曾作有趣的研究。他们计算结果：维持四口一家，一年最低需要二九六四美元，然而事实上根据最近美国报纸发表的材料，美国百分之七十的家庭没此种最低限度的供应能力。至于美国工人，其情况更是特别凄惨，美国工人百分之八十都在衣食水平以下生活。那不是无意义的，美国银行家的华尔街新闻机关已开始谈论“生产过剩”的威胁，其意义即为，在很短时期以内，当美国资本家们看到没有售出堆积的供应品之实际可能时，他们可能必须关闭工厂，但是这的确将成为可怕的经济危机预兆之开始。这个预兆使华尔街大亨们失去心中的平静，产业联合会主席穆莱在他致经济谘询会议的信中指出：假如美国的生产水平将降至预料的一九四四年的水平，就过去数年内增高的机械化而论，这将引起一千九百万失业者的形成！！经济学家指出：如果不用激烈的措施，生产水平的这种下降，在将近年底或一九四八年夏季，将会发生。美国报纸曾传达了不少的报导：反劳工立法正在美国进行，以“抑制顽固分子”。同时，尖锐地注意美国公共生活的人们也应谨防此种简短的报导，如佐治亚州“哥伦比亚人”的法西斯团体的暴露，这团体是按照希特勒匪党的模样建立的；或如志愿军队在纽约的建立。被派为该队队长的胡·得罗姆将军宣称：本队队员将受训练，以“镇压国内严重的紊乱”，其坦白可嘉。在此之后，报纸询问杜威是否知道：此种军队能够极容易成为美国突袭支队（按指法西斯性者）的核心呢？可惜，他没有回答。
