　　[Report from our Jiluyu Bureau, January 30th] Chiang Kai-shek's causing flooding has made the peace-loving residents on both sides of the Yellow River in the Liberated Areas hate him bitterly. In Yunbei, all twenty *qing* of land in Miaozhuang Village have been flooded, with ten *qing* already submerged. The entire land area of Xuzhuang Village is a vast expanse of water. Miao Yunqi and 70-year-old Miao Guangju of Miaozhuang Village had only just turned over a new leaf under the leadership of the democratic government and obtained land when, unfortunately, they were flooded again by the Chiang bandits. Miao Yunqi stomped his feet in anger and cursed: "I only got five *mu* of land, and I was looking forward to a good life. Now it's all over. If Old Chiang is forcing us to fight him to the death, then so be it!" Zhou Dama, who is over 70 years old, and her 64-year-old brother, who are both old and helpless, had just had a small house built for them by the whole village before the New Year. They are now worried and cursing every day because they are watching it collapse from the flood. Luo Chuanbao, a 14-year-old from Xuzhuang, used to beg for food with adults. Now his family has acquired several *mu* of land, and his life has improved. Luo Chuanbao has also put on a new navy blue cotton jacket. Now that all the land in Xuzhuang has been flooded, his life is immediately destitute. He cursed Old Chiang in anger for having no humanity and vowed: "Don't think that you can just flood us and get away with it. This debt will be settled on your head soon!" Zhang Yunmei, who was next to him, also cursed bitterly: "If I catch Old Chiang, I will bite him a couple of times to vent my hatred!"

　　[Report from our Jiluyu Bureau, January 30th] Because the Chiang side tore up all previous Yellow River management agreements and defaulted on levee repair funds, more than ten dangerous sections of the old course from Puyang to Zhangqiu, such as Liqiao and Wangzhuang, could not be repaired. The largest dangerous section, the "Jiangsu Dam," has a breach as wide as 2,100 *chi*. After the Yellow River water flowed into the old course, these more than ten dangerous sections are being eroded. The "Jiangsu Dam" dangerous section is in imminent danger. Our Yellow River Committee is now stepping up emergency repairs day and night. Due to the lack of straw materials, if the water level continues to rise, it will inevitably become dangerous. In the riverbed, eight villages including Nanzhuang, Meizhuang, and Gaozhuang in Shouzhang have now collapsed. Our Yellow River Committee's Third Repair and Defense Office has organized a self-rescue engineering team of more than 300 members, who are helping residents along the river and in the riverbed to salvage flooded property and repair levee dangerous sections day and night.

　　蒋介石放水成灾田庄冲毁
    下游居民切齿痛恨
    濮阳至张秋险工多处危在旦夕我黄委会组织工程队日夜抢修
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】蒋介石放水成灾，解放区黄河两岸之和平居民，无不切齿痛恨。郓北苗庄全村土地共二十顷，已有十顷被淹没，徐庄全村土地一片汪洋。苗庄村民苗云起及七十岁之苗广举，才在民主政府领导下翻了身，获得土地，不幸又被蒋贼放水淹没。苗云起气得跺脚大骂：“才分了五亩地，眼望着可以过好日子，这一下又完了，老蒋逼着我们和他拚命就拚了吧！”苗庄七十多岁之周大娘及其六十四岁之娘家兄弟衰老无依，年前全村帮他盖起的小屋，眼看就为洪水冲塌，两位老人为此整天发愁和咒骂。徐庄十四岁的罗传宝，以前跟着大人要饭吃，现在他家置了几亩地，生活改善了，罗传宝也穿起海蓝色新大袄来，如今徐庄土地全部被淹，生活顿时无着，气得他大骂老蒋没有人心，发誓说：“不要以为你淹了我们就算啦，这笔账很快就会算到你头上的！”旁边的张运梅也切齿骂道：“我逮住老蒋非得咬他两口，才能解恨！”
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】因蒋方撕毁历次治黄协议，拖欠修堤款项，致濮阳至张秋故道所有之险工李桥、汪庄等十余处均无法动工兴修，最大的险工“江苏坝”缺口宽达二千一百余尺。黄水流入故道后，此十余险工正被冲刷。“江苏坝”险工危在旦夕，现我黄委会正日夜加紧抢修中。因秸料缺乏，若水势续涨，势必成险，河床之新村现已有寿张的南庄、梅庄、高庄等八个村庄被冲坍，我黄委会第三修防处，已组织自救工程队，队员三百余人，日夜帮助沿河及河床居民抢救被淹财物，抢修堤防险工。
