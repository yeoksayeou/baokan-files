    Changzhi and Qiu Counties Distribute Land
    Paying Attention to Caring for Military Families
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 3rd] In the land redistribution movement in the first district of Changzhi City, special attention was paid to military families and helping honorably discharged soldiers establish households. Before the fruit (of the struggle) was distributed, specific measures for taking care of them were studied. After the meeting, each street universally conducted discussions among the masses and held forums for military families and honorably discharged soldiers to solicit their opinions, so that selected representatives could participate in the evaluation meeting. This time, the fruit distributed to military families accounted for 18% of all fruit. Ninety-nine military households, except for four rich peasant households, received fruit. Among them, eighteen poor households and six poor peasant households were elevated (in class status). Seven honorably discharged soldiers, including Weng Jiliu, who settled in the district, all worked in the explosive ordnance facility. The masses also proposed to give them seven rooms, three mu of land, and 140,000 yuan to help them establish households.
    [This newspaper's Wei County dispatch, 3rd] In the rent reduction movement in the second district of Qiu County, special attention was paid to caring for the poor and needy families of martyrs, military personnel, workers, and foreign military families. When distributing the fruit, after democratic evaluation by the masses, it was decided to raise the status of families of martyrs by two grades and families of military personnel by one grade, and they all had priority in purchasing furniture. In the entire district, there were 527 households of martyrs, military personnel, and workers in 42 villages. Each person received an average of more than one mu of land. In this rent reduction movement, each person received an average of 2.5 mu of land and more than 5,000 yuan. The land, houses, farm tools, and cattle of the poor and needy families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers in the entire district were thoroughly resolved. For soldiers without families, the land and houses that should be allocated to them were kept by the village office and cultivated by the masses on their behalf. After the military families in each village received the fruit, they sent letters to their sons, brothers, and husbands. Yan Huaiwang, a military family member, wrote a letter to his son telling him: "Our family has been treated very well by the village in this struggle. We have enough land to cultivate, enough houses to live in, and no difficulties at all. You should fight Chiang Kai-shek well at the front, and that will be filial piety to me."
