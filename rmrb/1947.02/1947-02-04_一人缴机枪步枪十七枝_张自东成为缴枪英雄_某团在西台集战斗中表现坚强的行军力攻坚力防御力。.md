[Report from the Jiluyu Front, this paper, dated January 31st] "Gun-Capturing Hero" Zhang Zidong single-handedly captured one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, two Canadian submachine guns, and thirteen rifles. Zhang Zidong is a soldier in the fifth company of a certain unit. During the Battle of Xitaiji in Dingtao, when the company charged into the breach at night, they were blocked by a heavy machine gun fiercely firing from the Chiang army. Zhang Zidong cleverly went around to the back of the Chiang army in the darkness, suddenly held down the machine gun and shouted: "Surrender or not?" At this time, the Chiang soldiers still thought it was their own people joking and said carelessly: "Who's messing around!" He kicked the Chiang soldier over and seized the heavy machine gun. His decisive action greatly encouraged all the soldiers in the company, who rushed to capture guns and prisoners. First Platoon Leader Zhang Shanting single-handedly captured one 60mm mortar, one pistol, one rifle, and captured a Chiang army company commander and more than ten soldiers. (Wu Xiang)
[Report from the Jiluyu Front, this paper, dated February 2nd] In the Battle of Xitaiji in Dingtao, after four consecutive nights of marching, a certain regiment captured the walled village in just a quarter of an hour, demonstrating strong marching and sharp assault capabilities. The next day, it continuously repelled more than nine counterattacks by 5,000 Chiang soldiers supported by airplanes and artillery, and firmly defended the northeast corner of Xitaiji, demonstrating even stronger defensive capabilities. In addition to special commendations, the leaders of the unit also made three award banners: "First in Establishing Military Merit," "Attacking Like a Fierce Tiger, Defending Like Mount Tai," and "Invincible," which were awarded to the model companies of the regiment that took the lead in attacking and defending, as well as the artillery.

    张自东成为缴枪英雄
    某团在西台集战斗中表现坚强的行军力攻坚力防御力。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线卅一日电】“缴枪英雄张”自东一个人缴重机枪一挺，轻机枪一挺，加拿大冲锋枪两枝，步枪十三枝。张自东是某部五连的战士，在定陶西台集战斗中，该连在夜间冲进突破口时，被蒋军一挺猛烈扫射的重机枪所阻，张自东就机智地在黑暗中绕到蒋军后边，突然按住机枪喊：“缴不缴枪？”此时蒋军犹以为是自己人开玩笑，不在意的说：“谁胡闹什么！”他一脚把蒋军踢翻，夺下了那挺重机枪。他的果敢行动给全连战士一极大鼓励，纷纷抢先去缴枪捉俘虏。一排长张善廷一个人就缴了六○炮一门，手枪一枝，步枪一枝，俘虏蒋军连长一名，士兵十余名。（吴象）
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】定陶西台集战斗中，某团在连续四夜行军后，仅以一刻钟的时间即攻入围寨，表现了坚强的行军力和锋锐的攻坚力。次日一日内又连续打退有飞机大炮配合的五千蒋军九次以上的反突击，固守了西台集的东北角，又显示了更坚强的防御力。该部首长除专加慰勉外，并制“首立战功”“攻似猛虎守如泰山”“无坚不摧”三面奖旗，分奖给该团之主攻与固守的模范连队及炮兵。
