    [Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu Front on the 13th] On the night of the 10th, our local guerrilla units completely destroyed five *li* of the Longhai Railway between Minquan and Liu River, recovering over 1,000 *jin* of electrical wire.
    [Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu Front on the 13th] In the battle to recover Neihuang, the Eighth Route Army annihilated over 700 Chiang's troops. On the 1st, two companies of the puppet army under Cheng Daosheng were wiped out at the four gates of Neihuang, with over 70 killed or wounded, and over 80 captured, seizing two light machine guns and 60 rifles. On the 3rd, the 318th Regiment of the 106th Brigade of Chiang's 40th Division, and a battalion of the 32nd Division, in coordination with the puppet Cheng Daosheng's troops, came to reinforce from Chu Wang. They were completely defeated by the Eighth Route Army at Da Xiao Zhanglong (northwest of Neihuang), with over 300 enemies killed or wounded, and over 250 captured, seizing 14 light and heavy machine guns, over 100 rifles, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition.
    [Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu Front on the 13th] Our army recovered Neihuang city, and, capitalizing on the victory, expanded the results of the battle. The remnants of the puppet Cheng Daosheng's troops, entrenched in Chu Wang (north of Neihuang) and Huilong (north of Chu Wang), were intimidated by the might of our army and fled in disarray westward towards Anyang. Thus, both banks of the Wei River, from Daming in the north to Neihuang in the south, are now free of enemy presence.
