　　Recognizing Landlords as the Root of Suffering
　　Julu Women Rise Up to Overthrow Their Oppressors
　　Dongzhang Village Unearths Landlord's Hidden Wealth

    [This dispatch was] transmitted from Jinnan on the 26th by our newspaper: The broad masses of women in Julu enthusiastically surge into the land reform movement. Zhang Chunren, a traitorous landlord in Dongzhang Village, District One, hid cloth and clothing at the home of a relative. The women's association investigated and confirmed this, asking his wife to confess. After repeated questioning by the women's association and the presentation of facts, she admitted to keeping two bundles, one stone of sesame seeds, one cart of sorghum, and one loom at her relative's house. Seeing that her confession was in line with the investigation, they allowed her to return home on bail. This action changed the men's view of belittling women. In Jinghuawo, District Two, in the past, young women were restricted by old family ethics, and only twenty elderly women participated in the movement. They did not offer opinions at meetings and did not believe in their own strength. This time, they were bold in the movement. When they discussed how to thoroughly overthrow their oppressors, after three days of networking by Jing Shumin and others, more than sixty women organized themselves. On the sixteenth day, according to the old custom, daughters-in-law all returned to their parents' homes. All the Party members then discussed which was more important, overthrowing their oppressors or returning to their parents' homes? Ms. Gao said: "I haven't returned to my parents' home once since I married at the age of sixteen. My mother cooks for the rich, and my father carries loads for others. We have nothing to eat or drink. Only by overthrowing our oppressors can we return to our parents' home." Gao Minnv said: "My family lacks food and clothing, and the land is small and the house is broken. If we go to our parents' home, it will delay the overthrow, and we will have to live a poor life for the rest of our lives." Er'ai said: "My husband's family is my own home. I resolutely will not go to my parents' home during the overthrow." Finally, they said in unison: "Overthrowing our oppressors is a major event; going to our parents' home is not important." At the struggle meeting in Shangcun Village, District One, women boldly recounted their sufferings. One woman pointed at the household being struggled against: "Why did you oppress me in the past? You forced my mother-in-law to death, tore down my house, and forced my family out. You even sold my child!" Speaking to this point, tears streamed down her face, and she was filled with anger. She stepped forward, grabbed the landlord, and said angrily: "You dog, you had the power to oppress me before, and I didn't even dare to breathe. Today, I must settle the accounts with you, you dog!" At the conference to struggle against the local tyrant landlord Pu Lao Jun in Xunhu Village, women spoke out about their suffering. The wife of the militia captain said, "When you were the village chief, you concealed land and had others pay your taxes for you. During the famine years, my whole family only had three liters of mung beans, and you robbed them all from us. My whole family starved for a day." Yu Suo's wife said: "You embezzled public funds when you were the village chief, even embezzling 170 yuan in cash for school funds. You levied too many taxes, and my child's father encouraged the poor not to pay. You called the police and arrested my child's father and took him to Daming, spending all my family property, and my child's father was imprisoned for half a year." Zhen Ze's wife said: "My husband was the village chief. You hated him for working for the poor and hired bad people to beat him to death. Was it you or not?" When they spoke of their pain, they aroused the anger of all the men and women in the audience, and everyone raised their fists and shouted to beat him.

　　认清地主是苦命根
    巨鹿妇女奋起翻身
    东张庄追出地主隐蔽财物
    【本报冀南二十六日电】巨鹿广大妇女热烈涌入土地改革运动。一区东张庄汉奸地主张纯仁，把布匹衣服藏在亲戚家，妇会调查确实，要他妻子坦白，经妇会再三追问和事实证明，才承认放在亲戚家两个包袱，一石芝麻，一车高粱，一个条机。大家见坦白的和调查的差不多，才叫她取保回家，这一行动转变了男子对妇女轻视的观点。二区景花窝过去因青年妇女受家庭旧礼教限制，只有二十个老年妇女参加运动，在开会时也不提意见，不相信自己力量。这次运动中就大胆了。当他们研究如何彻底翻身时，经过景淑敏等三天串连，有六十多名妇女组织起来，十六日按旧风俗媳妇都回娘家去，全体党员便讨论翻身和回娘家那个事要紧？高女说：“我从十六岁嫁了就没回过一次娘家，俺娘给财主做饭，爹给人家扛活，没吃没喝，只有翻了身才能回娘家。”高密女说：“家里少吃无穿，地少房破，要走娘家耽误了翻身，还得过一辈子穷日子。”二爱说：“婆家才是自己的家，在翻身中坚决不走娘家。”最后异口同声的说：“翻身是大事，走娘家不要紧。”一区上町村斗争大会上，妇女大胆诉苦，有个妇女用手指着被斗户：“为什么你从前欺压俺？逼死了我的婆婆，把俺的房屋都给拆掉？把俺家逼到外边去。把孩子也卖了？”说到这里，两眼落泪，怒气四冲，上前抓住地主，激愤的说：“狗儿的先前你有势力压迫俺连气都不敢出，今天就得给你狗儿的算算总账。”寻虎村斗争恶霸地主蒲老均的大会上，妇女纷纷诉苦，民兵队长媳妇说：“你当村长瞒地让别人替你拿款，过灾荒年时，俺全家只三升绿豆，你给俺全抢走，俺全家人干巴巴的饿了一天。”玉锁媳妇说：“你当村长贪污公款，连校款现洋一百七十元都贪污了，为你派款太多，俺孩子爹鼓动穷人不缴，你叫巡警把俺孩子爹抓到大名去，把俺的家产花光了，俺孩爹还坐了半年狱。”振泽媳妇说：“俺丈夫当村长你嫌他给穷人办事，买弄坏人把他打死，是你不是你？”她们说到痛处，激愤起全场男女群众，个个举拳喊打。
