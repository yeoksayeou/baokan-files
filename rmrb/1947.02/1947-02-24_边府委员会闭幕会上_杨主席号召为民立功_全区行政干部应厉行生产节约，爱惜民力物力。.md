　　At the Closing Meeting of the Border Government Committee
    Chairman Yang Calls for Meritorious Service to the People
    All Administrative Cadres in the Region Should Practice Production Economy and Cherish People's Strength and Material Resources.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Third Congress of the Border Government Committee successfully concluded at 2:00 PM on the 16th. In his closing remarks, Chairman Yang emphasized the call for all administrative cadres in the border region to practice production economy and launch a campaign to perform meritorious service for the people. He stated in brief: In the great production movement, production in government offices must create a surge. We must call on the people to work hard and change the past practice of emphasizing commerce and neglecting industry and agriculture. We must produce wealth. This will not only reduce the government's difficulties but also improve individual lives. More importantly, participating in production will raise our labor consciousness, help us understand that every grain comes from sweat and blood, and empathize with the people's lives. For those of us who have become separated from production and the masses, it can cultivate a mass perspective. Regarding family production, Chairman Yang pointed out that we should promote the "Chen Min Movement," follow the path of self-sufficiency through production like Comrade Chen Min in Yan'an, reduce the people's burden, and ensure the livelihood of families. Chairman Yang said: Production is primary, but we also need to practice economy. The first thing in practicing economy is to overcome extravagance and waste, and cherish the people's strength and material resources. Use an envelope three or four times, use domestic paper instead of foreign paper, and always remember "every grain of rice and every thread of cloth comes with difficulty" before we can talk about building a family. Like a comrade in a certain county who put on several days of opera when marrying his daughter-in-law, that is terrible! Although such things are individual cases, they should be taken seriously. The conservation efforts reported by the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Committee at this meeting should be commended. All regions are now also practicing economy, which is excellent. The fact that the majority of comrades do not want supplies or allowances should also be commended. Chairman Yang then proposed, in the name of the Border Government Committee, to launch a campaign to perform meritorious service for the people (unanimously agreed by all members), saying in brief: It is already behind reality to propose the meritorious service campaign today, as cadres have already performed many meritorious deeds. The leadership has not paid attention, and it is wrong to not reward meritorious deeds and only criticize mistakes, which should be reviewed. The Wang Keqin Movement in the army has played a significant role. The administration should learn from the army, promote its strengths, and enhance the creativity and enthusiasm of cadres to perform meritorious service for the people. Those who have already performed meritorious service should add more merits to their achievements. In order to carry out the meritorious service campaign, it is also necessary to solve the ideological problems of some cadres: First, overcome complacency and self-satisfaction, feeling that they are already correct and complaining about not being rewarded. Second, overcome the idea that there is no opportunity to perform meritorious service, such as some people thinking that stencil cutting or accounting cannot be meritorious, and that only combat support or mass movements can be. This is wrong; any kind of work can be meritorious. Third, get rid of baggage, such as showing off qualifications, being indifferent, saying "not enough experience," feeling depressed and uneasy, listless, and self-abandoning, etc. These baggage must be removed. As long as everyone works hard, influences and promotes each other, these ideological obstacles of a few comrades can be quickly overcome. Regarding the criteria for meritorious service, Chairman Yang introduced Shandong's four principles for reference: First, those who lead a department or an organization and have made significant achievements; second, those whose work exceeds the general level or has made significant achievements; third, those who have made special creations that can promote work; and fourth, those who overcome difficulties, complete tasks, and actively respond to the leadership's calls and actively make suggestions to the leadership that contribute. At this point, Chairman Yang said: The times create heroes. In this tense and struggling environment, anyone, anytime, anywhere, and in any matter can perform meritorious service. We should awaken all government working comrades, learn from the new heroism of our army in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, learn from the examples of the neighboring regions of Central China and Shandong, universally launch a campaign to perform meritorious service for the people, and develop it into a revolutionary competition wave.

　　边府委员会闭幕会上
    杨主席号召为民立功
    全区行政干部应厉行生产节约，爱惜民力物力。
    【本报特讯】边府委员会第三次大会十六日下午二时胜利结束，杨主席在闭幕词中强调号召全边区行政干部厉行生产节约，开展为人民立功运动。略称：在大生产运动中机关生产要造成热潮，号召人民要劳动，改变过去重商轻工农的作法，要生产财富。如此不仅减少公家困难，且可改善个人生活；更重要的是从参加生产中提高劳动观念，可以帮助我们了解粒粒皆血汗，体念人民生活，对于我们脱离了生产与群众隔离的人，可以培养群众观念。关于家属生产，杨主席指出，应该提倡“陈敏运动”，走延安陈敏同志生产自给的道路，减轻人民负担，保证家属生活。杨主席说：生产是主要的，但还需厉行节约。节约的第一件事是克服铺张浪费，爱惜民力物力，一个信封用三四次，用国纸不用洋纸，时刻在念“粒米寸缕来之不易”，才可以谈建立家务。像某县一个同志娶媳妇唱几天戏，不得了啊！这类事情虽然是个别的，但是应该严重注意。对于冀鲁豫委员在这次会上所报告的节约努力，应加以表扬；现在各区也都在厉行节约，是很好的。对多数同志不要供给、不要津贴也应表扬。接着杨主席提议以边府委员会名义号召开展为人民立功运动（全体委员一致同意），略谓：今天才提出立功运动，已落后于现实了，干部已立了很多的功。领导上没有注意，有功不赏，有错批评，这是不对的，应该检讨。部队上王克勤运动的作用是很大的，行政上应向部队学习，发扬优点，提高干部的创造性积极性，为民立功；已立功的，要功上加功。为了开展立功运动，还要解决某些干部的思想问题：一、克服居功自满思想，自觉不错了，埋怨不赏他。二、克服无机会立功的思想，如有人认为刻钢板当会计等等不能立功，作战勤或群众运动才行。这是不对的；那一种工作都能立功。三、解除包袱、如摆资格，满不在乎；说“经验不够”，心情烦闷不安心，暮气沉沉，不振作，自暴自弃等等包袱，必须解除。只要大家努力互相影响推动，这些少数同志的思想阻碍会能很快克服的。关于立功的标准，杨主席介绍山东的四条原则，供给参考：一、领导一个部门或一个组织有显著成绩者；二、任何工作超过一般水平或有显著成绩者；三、有特殊创造因而能推动工作者；四、克服困难，完成任务，并积极响应领导上的号召与积极向领导上建议有贡献者。至此，杨主席说：时势造英雄，当此紧张斗争环境，任何人任何时候任何地方任何事情都可以立功，应该唤起全体政府工作同志，学习我军打败蒋介石进攻的新英雄主义，学习友邻区华中、山东的榜样，普遍开展为人民立功运动，发展成为革命竞赛的浪潮。（秀山、辛生）
