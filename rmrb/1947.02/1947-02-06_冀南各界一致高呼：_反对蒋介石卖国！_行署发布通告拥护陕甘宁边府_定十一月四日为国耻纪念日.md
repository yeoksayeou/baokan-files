    【Benbao Weixian 31st Electric】"Swear to wash away national humiliation, abolish the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, and oppose American imperialism's aggression against China!" This is the unanimous cry from all sectors of southern Hebei after learning that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government has designated November 4th (the date of the signing of the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty) as National Humiliation Memorial Day. Ma Guorui, of the Southern Hebei CCP District Committee, stated: "In the Second World War, German, Italian and Japanese fascism had already been overthrown. The Chinese people, with their great strength, had broken free from the shackles of many unequal treaties over the past century, and many national humiliations had been washed away. Now, under the collusion between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialists, the 'Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation' has been established. This is a treaty of national betrayal by Chiang Kai-shek, a treaty of aggression against China by American imperialists, and our new national humiliation. The people of our entire region must resolutely fight to abolish this treaty of national betrayal and wash away national humiliation!" Director Meng of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office stated: "The Chiang-American Commercial Treaty is even more cruel than the Twenty-One Demands of Yuan Shikai. To maintain the survival and honor of the Chinese nation, there is only one path: to resolutely defeat and bury the dictatorial rule of the traitor and its traitorous treaties, and establish a new China." Gao Yuangui, a prominent figure in the Southern Hebei industrial and commercial circles, stated: "The Chiang-American Commercial Treaty deceives the people of the country with an absolutely hypocritical guise of 'equality.' China, which is still economically backward, is completely open to American imperialism. Surplus American goods will flood all of China like a deluge, inevitably destroying China's national industry. Once Chinese farmers lose their own industry, they will only become the object of exploitation by American imperialism, becoming its slaves. The import of American-made cigarettes and American cotton has seriously threatened the economic life of the people of southern Hebei. We swear to wash away national humiliation and abolish the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty! In addition to resolutely eliminating the invading Chiang troops, we must launch a broad movement to boycott American goods." Dynasty Pillar, a labor hero from Weixian County, hearing that the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had decided that November 4th would be National Humiliation Memorial Day, and hearing about the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty, said: "If Old Chiang attacks, and implements the treaty of national betrayal, my weaving brigade will not be able to continue. We must fight Chiang Kai-shek, who signed these treaties of national betrayal, to the death!"
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 2nd】The Southern Hebei Administrative Office has recently issued a notice endorsing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's designation of November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 4th】The Rehe Provincial Government convened a government affairs meeting on the 2nd, unanimously accepting the demands of all sectors of Ji-Re-Liao to endorse the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's designation of November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day.

    冀南各界一致高呼：
    反对蒋介石卖国！
    行署发布通告拥护陕甘宁边府
    定十一月四日为国耻纪念日
    【本报威县卅一日电】“誓雪国耻，废除蒋美商约反对蒋介石卖国，反对美帝国主义侵华！”这是冀南各界闻悉陕甘宁边府规定十一月四日（蒋美商约签字日）为国耻纪念日后，一致发出的呼声。冀南中共区党委马国瑞谈称：“在第二次世界大战中已把德意日法西斯打倒了，中国人民以自己的伟大力量从近百年来许多不平等条约的枷锁中摆脱出来，许多国耻才得到洗刷，如今在蒋介石与美帝国主义者狼狈为奸的阴谋下，又定了《中美通商航海条约》，这是蒋介石卖国的条约，这是美国帝国主义者侵略中国的条约，这是我们新的国耻。我们全区人民要为废除这一卖国条约与洗雪国耻坚决奋斗！”冀南行署孟主任谈称：“蒋美商约比袁日廿一条更为残酷，为维持中华民族的生存与荣誉，只有一条道路，这就是坚决打垮和埋葬了卖国贼的独裁统治及其卖国条约，建立新的中国。”冀南工商业界巨子高元贵称：“蒋美商约是以绝对虚伪的‘平等’的外衣欺蒙国人；在经济上仍然落后的中国，对美帝国主义一切开放，美国过剩商品将如洪水泛滥于全中国，势必摧毁中国民族工业。中国农民一旦失去自己的工业，那就只有当作美帝国主义的压榨对象，为其奴隶。美制纸烟与美棉输华，已严重威胁着冀南人民的经济生活。我们誓雪国耻，废除蒋美商约！除坚决消灭进犯蒋军外，我们要开展一个广泛的抵制美货运动。”威县劳动英雄王朝柱听到陕甘宁边区决定十一月四日为国耻纪念日，听到蒋美商约，他说：“如果老蒋打过来，一实行卖国条约，我领导的纺织大队就没法干了。咱非和订这些卖国条约的蒋介石拼命不可！”
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二日电】冀南行署顷发布通告，拥护陕甘宁边区政府规定十一月四日为国耻纪念日。
    【新华社冀热辽四日电】热河省政府于二日召开政务会议，一致接受冀热辽各界要求赞同陕甘宁边府之规定以十一月四日为国耻纪念日。
