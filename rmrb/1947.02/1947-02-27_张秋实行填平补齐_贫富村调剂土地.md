　　Zhang Qiu Implements Leveling and Equalization
    Land Adjustment Between Rich and Poor Villages
    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 25th] Zhang Qiu's Niu, Wang, and Ma Li villages are implementing leveling and equalization, adjusting land to distribute to poor peasants. After the mass movement last year, Niu Sanli and Wang Sanli villages in the Third District were extremely impoverished, with each person receiving at least two mu of land. Ma Sanli still had three extremely impoverished households and five poor peasant households, and the land problem could not be resolved. Zhou Bangnian from that village proposed that the three villages establish a reform inspection committee to take from the rich to supplement the poor and level and equalize. After persuasion and mobilization, 28 mu of land, 14 trees, and 1,400 jin of grain were adjusted, and the extremely impoverished peasants of Ma Sanli all received land and goods.
