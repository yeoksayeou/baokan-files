　　Anglo-French and Soviet Union Increasingly United
    American Diplomacy More Isolated
    What is the state of the Big Four on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference? The past week has provided some enlightenment on this question.

    When the British, American, and French foreign ministers arrive in Moscow next month, they will see the Soviet people united as never before. The Supreme Soviet elections in the seven republics on February 9th demonstrated the great unity of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and the solid alliance of the Communist Party and non-Party members. More than 99% of the voters participated in the elections, and more than 99% of them voted for candidates of the Communist Party and non-Party members. These elections show the enthusiastic support of the entire Soviet people for the Bolshevik Party and the government, which is one of the strong backings of Soviet foreign policy. This should impress the British, American, and French foreign ministers deeply.

    Looking back at Britain, the Labor government seemed to have attempted to resolve some diplomatic problems before Foreign Secretary Bevin left for the meeting. Hence, there were the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and the Anglo-Burmese negotiations, followed by the Palestine Conference. Unexpectedly, the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations broke down, and the Palestine Conference also failed. Although the Anglo-Burmese negotiations reached some agreements, they were opposed by Burmese democrats. Britain is still troubled by colonial issues. Furthermore, the economic crisis caused by the coal shortage in the past week has severely hit the whole of Britain. Half of the factories have closed down, and five to six million workers are unemployed. This is the most serious crisis since the Labor government came to power 19 months ago. Conservative Party members are plotting to take advantage of this to shake the Labor government, prompting the resignation of Fuel Minister Shinwell and thereby overthrowing the Labor's "nationalization" plan starting from the coal mines, but so far they have not succeeded. Lawther, the chairman of the British Mineworkers' Union (which has more than 700,000 members and whose general secretary is Horner, a member of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party), issued a public statement on the afternoon of the 14th, saying: "All miners fully support Shinwell and oppose the Conservative Party's use of the current coal shortage for political activities." The direct cause of this coal shortage is undoubtedly the snowstorm blocking transportation, but the fundamental reason lies in the failure to implement the nationalization plan, with large capital also hindering it. At the same time, the Labor government's foreign policy is inconsistent with its domestic policy. The French Communist Party's newspaper L'Humanité stated: "This crisis, which is causing Britain to decline, undeniably proves that the attempt to implement a progressive policy at home while pursuing an imperialist policy abroad is futile." The New York Herald Tribune pointed out that if Britain does not reduce its 1.7 million troops, it will not be able to solve the shortage of coal miners, which requires reconsidering its overall foreign policy. Recently, Britain has officially acknowledged that Bulgaria rejected American coal aid, British troops stationed in Britain were partially repelled, and rumors that Bevin will discuss treaty revisions with the Soviet side at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. These are not without cause.

    Regarding France, its recent diplomatic dynamics are also quite noteworthy. The Anglo-French alliance treaty (one of the important goals of which is to solve the British economic problem) has been drafted. The Franco-Czech alliance treaty and the Franco-Polish cultural agreement are also under negotiation; at the same time, French Prime Minister Ramadier has expressed his hope that after the Anglo-French alliance is signed, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can issue a joint declaration on mutual assistance among the three powers.

    Outside this triangular alliance, in the United States, Marshall made a secret report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 14th, which Vandenberg considered "exciting," but Marshall avoided talking about the Foreign Ministers Conference and relations with the Soviet Union at the recent two press conferences.

### 英法与苏日趋团结  美国外交更加孤立

　　英法与苏日趋团结
    美国外交更加孤立
    莫斯科外长会议召开前夕的四强处于怎样的情况中？过去一周中，对我们了解这个问题提供了若干启示。
    当英美法三国外长下月莅临莫斯科时，将看见苏联人民在空前的团结着。本月九日，七个加盟共和国的最高苏维埃选举中，表现了苏联工人、农民与知识分子的大团结，联共党与非党的巩固联盟，百分之九十九以上的选民参加选举，其中又有百分之九十九以上选举联共党与非党的候选人。从这次选举中，显示着苏联全体人民对布尔塞维克党和政府的热烈拥护，就是苏联对外政策的有力的后盾之一，这当予英美法外长甚深印象。
    回顾英国，工党政府似乎曾企图在外相贝文离英赴会之前解决若干外交难题，故前有英埃谈判、英缅谈判，近有巴勒斯坦会议，不意英埃谈判破裂于前，巴勒斯坦会议又失败于后。英缅谈判虽达若干协议，但又为缅甸民主人士所反对，英国依然为殖民地问题所苦恼。不宁唯是，一周来由煤荒而造成的经济危机，猛袭全英，半数工厂关门，五六百万工人失业，为工党政府执政十九个月以来最严重之危机，保守党分子阴谋借此动摇工党政府，促使燃料部长辛威尔辞职，并从而推翻从煤矿开始的工党“国有化”计划，唯迄未得逞。拥有七十余万会员的英国矿工联合会（该会总书记为英共中委霍尔纳）主席劳瑟于十四日下午发表公报称：“全体矿工充分支持辛威尔，反对保守党利用目前煤荒作政治活动。”按此次煤荒直接近因固为大风雪阻塞交通，但根本原因在于国有化计划未能贯彻，大资本又从中阻挠，同时工党政府的对外政策亦与其国内政策不相称。法共人道报称：“这一正使英国陷于颓败的危机，不可置辩地证明要在国内执行一个进步政策，而同时又在国外推行一个帝国主义政策的企图是无用的”。纽约先驱论坛报指出，如英国不把其一百七十万军队加以裁减，则无法解决煤矿工人的缺乏，而这就必须重行考虑其全盘对外政策。最近英国正式承认，保加利亚拒绝美国运煤援助，驻日英军部分击退，以及传闻贝文出席莫斯科外长会议时将与苏方商谈修约问题等等，这些都不是无因的。
    关于法国其最近的外交动态，亦颇堪注意。英法同盟条约（重要目的之一，在于解决英国经济问题）已草拟完竣。法捷同盟条约与法波文化协定又在谈判中；同时，法总理拉玛第并表示希望英法同盟签订后，英、法、苏能发表关于三强互助的联合宣言。
    在这三角同盟之外的美国，马歇尔于十四日向参院外交委员会作了一个范登堡认为“令人兴奋”的秘密报告，但马氏在最近两次记者招待会上，均对外长会议与对苏关系避而不谈。
