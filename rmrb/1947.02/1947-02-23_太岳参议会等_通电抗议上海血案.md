　　Taiyue Council and Others
    Send Telegram Protesting Shanghai Massacre
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 17th] Upon hearing the news of the Shanghai Quangong Building massacre on the 9th, all circles in Taiyue were filled with grief and indignation, and protested. The Taiyue Council, All-Circles United Association, Cultural Circles United Association, and others jointly sent a telegram to express their solidarity and condolences to the compatriots who were harmed. The telegram stated roughly: Just as the people of Taiyue are fully supporting the front lines and striving for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, we learned that your patriotic gathering to "save Chinese industry from bankruptcy" was sabotaged and disrupted by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. The Jiaochangkou massacre was reenacted, with twelve people seriously injured on the spot, and Mr. Liang Renda died from his serious injuries. Upon hearing this news, we unanimously protest Chiang Kai-shek's shameless traitorous behavior. In addition to sending condolences to the families of the deceased and expressing sympathy to the injured, we, on behalf of the three million people of the entire region, fully support your great patriotic action. We will work even harder to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek troops attacking Taiyue and strive for national independence, democracy, and peace. Your patriotic action represents the will of the people of the whole country, and 400 million people will be your backing. We hope you will continue your efforts and resolutely fight to the end.
