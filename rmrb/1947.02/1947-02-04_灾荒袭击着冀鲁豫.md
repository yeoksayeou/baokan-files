　　Disaster Strikes the Ji-Lu-Yu Region
　　Ji-Lu-Yu Branch

　　Ji-Lu-Yu is facing a new disaster, and thousands of people are once again plunged into the abyss of hunger and cold. The wounds of the enemy and natural disasters of the past eight years have not yet healed, and the new Chiang Kai-shek's disasters and floods will wipe out everything the people have. Here are just some extremely incomplete snippets of information.

　　In the Chiping, Boping, and Liaocheng counties of the Sixth District, which were severely damaged by past enemy disasters, more than 35,000 people were conscripted, more than 25,000 were killed, and about 160,000 died, starved, or went missing due to enemy disasters and droughts. More than 140,000 houses were burned down by the enemy, and the loss of production tools was even greater. To name a few major items: more than 3,000 carts, more than 2,000 wheelbarrows, and more than 9,000 plows. The big traitor Wang Jinxiang, who occupied Liaocheng, was only driven away by the Eighth Route Army and the people, and Luo Zhaorong came to harass again. To this day, there are still no-man's-lands in Chiping and Boping. There are currently 110,000 people in these three counties without food or clothing. The disaster-stricken sandy areas suffered severely in the notorious 1942 Great Purge, with more than 4,800 people killed and more than 50,000 houses burned down. Most of the jujube trees on which the people depended for survival were cut down. Then came the great drought of 1943. According to statistics from one district of Neihuang County, more than 3,300 people starved to death. Followed by several years of locust plagues and poor harvests, this year there was an unprecedented flood. In Neihuang County alone, the flooded area affected four districts, totaling 270,000 mu, and 80% of the only agricultural product in the sandy area, peanuts, was destroyed. Most of the jujubes in the southern part of the sandy area were destroyed by fog. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's troops invaded the sandy area and swept away all the people's meager food supplies. In the Third and Fifth Districts, with the invasion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, an unprecedented catastrophe was brought to the people. In just five months, more than 9,000 people were killed in the Third District. In the Fifth District, only more than 800 people were massacred in more than ten villages such as Sun Lao Jia in Fucheng County. A large number of young men were conscripted, and the masses fled in droves. In the Fifth District, the number of refugees from Qibin, Fucheng, and Dingtao counties was about 35,000. Some have returned successively, but there are still more than 10,000 people displaced. Although they have been relieved by the government, they cannot return home and their lives are still extremely difficult. Wherever Chiang Kai-shek's troops went, they dug three feet into the ground, and all the grain was looted. In Mafeng Village, Qibin County, 180 large carts of wheat were looted. The same was true for villages near Baimaoji in Kaocheng County. In several villages around Dayang Lake, where Chiang Kai-shek's troops were stationed, everything was looted, and there was not a single complete house left. The weather was cold, and there was no clothing or bedding. One family of seven or eight people had only one cotton quilt, and the whole family could not survive the winter. One cotton coat was taken out in turns for people to wear. The floods submerged two-fifths of the crops in the Fifth District, with only 20-30% of the harvest from previous years. In Chaocheng, 1,036 qing of land were flooded (two-thirds of which were completely submerged), accounting for one-quarter of the county's land. 169 villages were flooded (the county has a total of 364 villages). In Nanle County, which had suffered two severe droughts, more than 100 villages were flooded this year, and 2,425 qing of land were submerged (the county has 380 villages, 7,200 qing of land, and a population of 170,000). 60,000 people were flooded, and 16,000 houses collapsed in the initial survey alone. Last year's harvest was very bad, and 30% of the population went hungry after the autumn harvest. The general population can only survive until the end of the lunar year, and many people have no cotton clothes to wear. In the Seventh District, which has many lakes, the floods are even more severe. Here, Machang Lake is 30 li long and 10 li wide, and the flooded villages affect more than 40 villages. Shushan Lake floods an area of 120 li long and 40 li wide. Nan'an Lake was flooded in more than 40 villages. The Dihuji area in the first district of Nan'an was flooded in more than 10 villages, covering about 300 qing of land. In Jiaxiang, the Zhushui River flooded 40 qing of land in the mountainous and Tengfang areas respectively. To this day, more than 30 villages have been flooded in this low-lying area, covering more than 30 qing of land. The most severely affected by the floods are Cuishan and Dongping counties, which border Dongping Lake. Dongping Lake flooded more than 7,000 qing of land, Cuishan County was flooded with more than 5,000 qing, and Dongping County was flooded with 2,500 qing of land, turning it into a vast expanse of water. For example, in Machang Lake, more than 30 villages were flooded, and only one-sixth of the sorghum land remained, with each mu of sorghum yielding only 20 jin. In the past, the masses made a living by fishing, but now the fishing boats have long been sold. Two-thirds of the population of Dongping Lake fled. This year, there has been a general poor harvest in various parts of the border area. The disaster situation in Changqing and Feicheng in the First District is also severe, and the Second District also has floods and Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. According to the above materials, it can be seen that the disaster has struck every corner of the Ji-Lu-Yu border area. How to overcome this serious disaster is indeed a serious problem facing the people of the border area. Everyone is thinking of ways to practice thrift on the one hand, and vigorously carry out land reform and organize production on the other hand, preparing to meet and overcome the difficulties of the disaster that has already arrived. Recently, although some relief supplies have been transported from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), these supplies are the result of half a year of negotiations and struggles by the people of the border area. This little bit of supplies is truly a drop in the bucket in terms of the disaster situation in the border area, but we are still working hard to make these supplies exert their greatest effectiveness. We want to appeal to UNRRA: to ask UNRRA to give us more supplies, but more importantly, to rely on ourselves—the entire border area, party, government, army, and people, working together.

　　灾荒袭击着冀鲁豫
    冀鲁豫分社
    冀鲁豫正面临着一个新的灾荒，万千人民又陷入饥寒交迫的深渊，八年来敌灾及天灾的创伤未痊，新的蒋灾和水灾又将荡尽了人民的一切，这里仅仅收集了些极不完全的片断材料。
    六分区遭过去敌灾严重损害的茌平、博平、聊城三县地区，被抓壮丁达三万五千余人，被杀二万五千余人，因敌灾旱灾病死饿死失踪者约十六万人，房屋被敌人烧毁有十四万余间，生产工具损失更重，举其较大者：大车三千余辆、小车二千余辆、犁九千余具，大汉奸王金祥盘据聊城才被八路军及人民赶走，罗兆荣又继来骚扰。至今茌平、博平现还存在着无人区，这三个县目前就有十一万人无吃无穿。灾难深重的沙区，在有名的一九四二年大扫荡中，被杀四千八百余人，被烧房屋五万余间，人民生存依靠的枣树大多被砍光。接着一九四三年的大旱灾，据内黄县一个区的统计：饿死三千三百余人，跟着几年蝗灾加歉收，今年又是空前的水灾，被淹地仅内黄县就波及四个区，有廿七万亩，而沙区唯一的农产物花生即淹毁了百分之八十，枣在沙区南部大部被雾气毁坏了。最近蒋军侵入沙区，将人民仅有粮食一扫而光，而在三、五分区随着蒋军的侵入，给人民带来了空前浩劫，在短短的五个月中，三分区被残杀者在九千人以上，五分区仅复程县孙老家等十余村被屠杀八百人左右，大批壮丁被抓，群众纷纷逃亡。五分区仅齐滨、复程、定陶县逃亡者人数约在三万五千人左右，有些陆续回去的，但目前尚有万余人流浪在外，虽经政府救济，但有家归不得，生活仍极困难，蒋军到处，掘地三尺，所有粮食，均被抢光。齐滨县马峰一村即被抢麦子一百八十大车。其他如考城县白茅集附近村子都是如此。在蒋军盘据的大杨湖一带几个村庄，东西被抢光，一间完整的屋子都没有了，天气寒冷，无衣无被，有一家七、八口人，只有一个棉被，全家没法过冬，一件棉衣替换穿着出门。水淹没了五分区五分之二的庄稼，仅有往年的两三成收成。朝城被水淹没了一○三六顷地（其中三分之二是全部淹没的）占全县土地四分之一，被淹村庄一六九个（全县共有三六四村）。在南乐县曾遭过两次严重旱灾，今年水灾被淹村庄百余个，淹没地二四二五顷（全县三八○村，七千二百顷地，十七万人口）被淹人口有六万，房屋倒塌，仅初次调查，即有一万六千间。去年收成很坏，有百分之卅的人口秋收后就挨饿，一般的人口只能维持旧历年底，很多的群众没有棉衣穿。湖泊多的七分区，水灾更是严重，这里马厂湖长三十里，宽十里，被淹村庄波及四十余村，蜀山湖淹地面积长一百廿里，宽四十里。南岸湖被淹四十余村，南岸一区抵虎集一带，被淹十余村，地约三百顷。嘉祥潴水河淹没山区、藤房区各四十余顷，至今这一带洼地被淹卅余村，地卅余顷。水灾最为严重的是地临东平湖的崔山、东平两县，东平湖水淹地七千余顷，崔山县被淹没五千余顷，东平县二千五百余顷土地，成为一片汪洋。如马厂湖被淹卅余村，只有六分之一的高粱地，每亩高粱只合廿斤。过去群众打渔为生，现在渔船早已卖掉，东平湖群众逃亡者占全人口三分之二。今年边区各地普遍歉收，一分区长清、肥城灾情亦重，而二分区也同样有水灾和蒋灾。根据以上材料，可知灾荒已经袭击到冀鲁豫边区的各个角落，如何克服这一严重灾荒，确实是边区人民面前的一个严重问题。大家想办法，一面实行节约，一面大力进行土地改革，组织生产，准备迎接与克服已经到来的灾荒困难。最近虽从联总运来了一点救济物资，这些物资是经过半年的谈判交涉与边区人民斗争来的。这一点物资按边区灾情来说，真是杯水车薪，但我们仍然努力使这些物资，发挥其最大的效能。我们要向联总呼吁：要求联总给予我们以更多的物资，但更重要的是依靠我们自己——全边区党政军民一齐努力。
