    The Chicken Coop People's Cooperative in Jize Serves the People Everywhere
    Jinan Branch
    The Jize People's Cooperative has been operating for nine months, and it has always worked on the principle of seeking the interests of the masses. Initially, the fund was only 2.6 million yuan, but due to the continuous investment of the masses and the cooperative's business growth, it has now grown to more than 6 million yuan. There has also been significant progress in the scope of operations and the expansion of business. In recent months, it has successively opened Jizhong Hospital, oil workshops, flower workshops, restaurants, sauce shops, vinegar and oil workshops, etc. Since its establishment, it has been inseparable from the prosperity of the Jize city market and the development of industry and commerce. It has also played a significant role in solving the unemployment of poor vendors and the county's surplus labor force.
    Some poor vendors often fell into unemployment because they had no capital. The cooperative set a solution: when purchasing goods from the cooperative, they do not need to pay capital first, but pay after selling the goods. When calculating the price of goods between the cooperative and small merchants, the cooperative gives the small merchants a considerable profit. Poor merchants in Chengguanying in the first district, Lufang, Beifengzheng in the second district, Shuangta in the third district, and Chengguan all rely on the cooperative to maintain their livelihoods. After the government confiscated the property, cloth, and clothing of the traitors, the cooperative bought them and let the poor masses take the materials to places with high prices to sell first, and then give the money to the cooperative after they came back. The money earned belongs to the masses. The masses in Chengguan and the masses in Liuxia and Xizhuang villages in the third district also benefited from this cooperative.
    When women in the county started spinning but had no capital, the cooperative bought cotton and lent it to the spinning groups in various villages throughout the county at low interest. In order to promote women's active spinning, the cooperative decided not to let women store cloth in their hands. If there are no foreign merchants buying cloth, the cooperative will collect it at the price of cloth, which solves the difficulty for poor women who have cloth but cannot sell it. In this way, the spinning movement in the county has flourished.
    According to the difficulties and needs of the masses, the cooperative and the government jointly established Jizhong Hospital, and hired several Chinese and Western doctors. Because the hospital has a complete range of Chinese and Western medicines and skillful treatment, and the hospital's drug prices are lower than market prices, it has solved many difficulties for the local masses. According to the immediate needs of the masses in each period, the cooperative went to Linzhang, Qingfeng, Weixian, Nangong, Linqing, Xingtai, Handan and other places to sell and buy the necessities needed by the masses, and completed the task even if it suffered great setbacks and difficulties. Such as buying mats, pigments, ironware, porcelain, etc., and selling them to the masses at low prices.
    To solve the surplus labor force of the masses, the cooperative adopted the method of jointly operating with the masses using its own funds and the manpower of the masses. In Xianbeiying in the first district, it combined with the masses to set up three oil workshops, in Xizhuang Yichenghuang in the third district, it combined with the masses to set up a small flower workshop, and in the city, it combined with the masses to set up a restaurant, thus solving the problem of the surplus labor force of the masses.
    To support the cooperative undertakings in districts and villages, the cooperative allocated 2 million yuan of funds and lent them to the thirteen central cooperatives in the county respectively, so that the central cooperatives could solve the capital difficulties and operate actively. The cooperative also lent capital to general cooperatives in the village, on the condition that the village operates well and has little capital.
    With the support and cultivation of the cooperative, the market in the city has become increasingly prosperous and expanded, and it has formed an inseparable relationship with the masses. For example, during the recent preparation for war, when the cooperative moved materials out, some poor vendors and masses believed that the cooperative was about to leave this place, and it would be difficult for poor merchants in the city to maintain their livelihoods. Zhao Zhou and Shen Zhenjiang from Xiguan went to the cooperative one after another and said: "The cooperative should not move anyway. If it moves away, the city will collapse, and it will not be cheap for us to do business." The cooperative explained the reason for evacuating the materials to them according to the requirements of the masses, and after promising that it would not relax its support for them in the future, they felt relieved.

    处处为人民服务的鸡泽大众合作社
    冀南分社
    鸡泽大众合作社，至今已经营九个月之久，它始终是在与群众谋利益的原则下进行工作。起初基金仅二百六十万元，由于群众源源不断的入股和社的经营生息，现在已发展至六百多万元。在经营的范围和生意的扩大上，亦有显著进步，数月以来，先后分别开办了济众医院、油坊、花坊、饭铺、酱铺、醋油坊等。自创设以来，就与鸡泽城内集市的繁荣和工商业的发展分不开，在解决贫苦商贩的失业与全县的乘余劳动力上，也起了很大作用。
    有些贫苦商贩，过去常因无本钱陷于失业，大众社定了解决办法，到大众社办货时，首先不拿本钱，等将货物卖出再交本。在大众社与小商人计算物价时，给小商人以相当的利润。一区程官营、二区路方、北风正、三区双塔的及城关的贫苦商人，都依靠大众社而维持了生活。政府没收汉奸的财物布匹衣服等，大众社买了后，即让贫苦群众先将物资拿到物价贵的地方卖，回来后再给大众社交钱，赚的钱归给群众。城关的群众和三区柳下、西庄等村的群众，也得到这个社的利益。
    在全县妇女纺织起初还没本的时候，大众社则买棉花，低利贷给全县各村的纺织组，为了促进妇女积极纺织，大众社决定不叫妇女手里存布，如没有外商买布时，大众社则按布价收庄，这样便解决了贫苦妇女有布卖不出去的困难。如是全县纺织运动遂逢勃开展起来。
    根据群众的困难和需要，大众社和政府合设了济众医院一所，聘请中西医生数人。由于院内中西药材俱全，医治高明，医院药价低于市价，解决了当地群众不少的困难。根据每一个时期群众的切身需要，大众社就分往临漳、清丰、威县、南宫、临清、邢台、邯郸等地，卖买群众需用的必须品，即使受多大的挫折和困难，也要完成任务。如买席、颜料、铁器、磁品等等，并以廉价出卖给群众。
    解决群众的剩余劳动力，大众社采用自己的资金与群众的人力合伙经营的办法。在一区的县北营，与群众结合办油房三处，在三区的西庄一城隍，与群众结合成立小花坊，并在城内与群众结合成立饭馆一座，如是解决了群众剩余劳动力的问题。
    扶助区村合作事业，大众社曾抽出二百万元的资金，分别贷给全县的十三个中心社，使各中心社解决资本困难，营业活跃起来。大众社还将资本贷给村的一般合作社，条件是本村经营的好而资本少的。
    经大众社扶植和培养，使本城的集市日渐繁荣与扩大，他与群众产生了血肉不可分离的关系。如这次进行备战时，大众社往外疏散物资，有的贫苦商贩及群众，认为大众社要离开这地方，城里贫苦商人就难以维持生活。西关赵周、申振江等人，纷纷到大众社去说：“大众社好歹不要搬，如搬走城市就得垮台，我们做买卖也不便宜了。”大众社就根据群众这些要求，给他们解释了疏散物资的道理，和以后并不放松对他们的扶持之后，他们才安心。
