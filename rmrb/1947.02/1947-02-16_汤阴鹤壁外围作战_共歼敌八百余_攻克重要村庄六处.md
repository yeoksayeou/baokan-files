[Taixing, Our Newspaper, Fourteenth Dispatch] The Taihang Military Region today issued a public communique on the outskirts operations at Tangyin and Hebi, stating: In this counterattack by our army against the outposts of Chiang's and puppet Hebi, a total of over 500 enemy soldiers of Sun Dianying's and other units were killed or wounded, and over 360 enemy soldiers, including battalion and company commanders, were captured. One mortar, two small cannons, two heavy machine guns, forty-five light machine guns, and over one hundred and sixty long and short guns were seized. Ji’s Family Mountain, Ji’s Family Gully, Kang’s Family, Chunshulin (erroneously reported as Deng’s Family in the previous telegram), Sun Sheng Gully, Yang Family Village and six other locations have been captured. The Chiang's and puppet Hebi is now surrounded. The offensive began at 8:00 PM on the 7th. Our army simultaneously launched a fierce attack on the above-mentioned villages. The puppet troops holed up in the bunkers were completely eliminated in one to three hours at most. On the afternoon of the 8th, over one hundred enemy troops from Tangyin coming to the rescue were also defeated east of Hebi. In this battle, a total of over one hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, over two hundred and sixty people were captured, thirty-three light machine guns, two small cannons, over one hundred and sixty long and short guns, and a large amount of ammunition were seized. We suffered only a dozen or so casualties. On the morning of the 9th, a unit of Chiang's and puppet troops besieged in Hebi extended to Jiajia Village (three miles east of Bihe) to probe, and immediately retreated upon encountering our army. On the afternoon of the 9th, a unit of over a thousand soldiers from the 106th Brigade of the 40th Division of Chiang's army in Anyang passed through the Liansi Station (south of Anyang) to reinforce Hebi, launching a fierce bayonet charge. Our follow-up troops arrived successively, and after forty minutes of intense fighting, they broke into the village, and the enemy fled in panic. In this battle, the enemy suffered hundreds of casualties, and all the men and women in Yuanzhuang Village were captured by the enemy to carry the wounded soldiers. On the morning of the 11th, four regiments of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, who had newly fled from Chu Wang, Neihuang, and returned to Tangyin City, invaded westward to reinforce Hebi, and were repelled at Luocun (more than ten miles south of Hebi). Over one hundred enemies were killed, one battalion and one company commander were captured, one mortar, two heavy machine guns, and twelve light machine guns were seized.

Furthermore: On the evening of the 10th, our × unit attacked the Five Villages' Shops east of Hui County. A company of the puppet Li Ying's unit stationed there had fled beforehand, leaving a platoon to ambush outside the village. When our army arrived, the puppet troops threw grenades fiercely at us. Because we were unprepared, eight of our soldiers were wounded. However, our army did not panic and immediately surrounded and disarmed them all. A total of four enemies were killed, twenty-five people were captured, one light machine gun, and over twenty rifles were seized.
