    [Pingshun News from Our Newspaper] Pingshun began its movement to realize "land to the tiller" in early December of last winter. Within 40 days, around January 10th, land reform was universally completed throughout the county. At the beginning of the movement, the leadership clearly put forward the slogan of "cutting off the tails and filling the holes," and the cadres went deep into the mountain villages and scattered homes, facing the "hole-ridden" households and mobilizing the backward elements. For example, in Longyugou in the First District, a family of nine was found living in a cellar, and none of them had cotton-padded clothes. While going deep into the mountain villages and scattered homes, they also resolved the relationship between cadres and the masses, and publicized the land policy among the broad masses of peasants, especially repeatedly publicized the middle peasant policy, stabilized the middle peasant sentiment, and actively participated in the struggle. This period lasted about five to ten days. After brewing and finding the "tails," they entered the period of great struggle, organizing accusations to discover problems, further digging out the "tails," electing overturning committees, holding struggle meetings, and centrally managing the fruits of victory. This stage also lasted about five to seven days. After the struggle ended, the fruits of victory were distributed. The method was to conduct evaluation discussions, elect management committees and distribution committees, announce and exhibit the fruits of victory, hold celebration meetings, summarize and evaluate heroes and models, calculate the benefits of being emancipated, and finally organize for production. In the past 40 days, according to the statistics of the five districts (missing the Third and Fifth Districts), farmers recovered 16,558 mu of land, 8,312 houses, 40,900 dan of grain, 2,261 head of livestock, 17,599 sheep, and more than 30,000 pieces of clothing and furniture from the landlords, a total of 40,493 peasants obtained land, and 1,582 extremely poor peasants have risen to the status of middle peasants. Throughout the entire movement, cadres and the masses showed a high degree of awareness. For example, Song Tongze, director of the Armed Committee of Longyugou, said: "In the past, I was more concerned about the fruits of victory and less concerned about the movement; now I am more concerned about the movement and less concerned about the fruits of victory," which is exactly the opposite. Li Yinke from Daqu said: "In the past, the old rich had a 'hairy god of wealth,' and we have three 'living gods of wealth' – the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the Eighth Route Army, and the village cadres." In the awakening of the masses, the landlords' "tails" could not be hidden. Yang Laoyan organized more than 30 people to specifically search for the things hidden by the landlords in the mountain gullies. In one search in a stone cliff, they found more than 900 jin of salt, more than 60 jin of cotton, more than 40 bolts of cloth, and 20 dan of grain. After summing up the experience of the emancipation, the masses showed high enthusiasm for production and armed struggle. In the afternoon, Jing textile and transportation earned 900,000 yuan, and Yangjingdi earned more than 5 million yuan. Guo Guicheng, an old man from Chuandi, insisted that his son join the militia. The son was initially unwilling, and the old man angrily wanted to return the fruits of victory, saying: "If you don't join the militia and no one protects it, what do I want this for?" Another example is Yang Hei, 46, from Longzhen, who wanted to join the militia. The cadres and militiamen said: "You are too old!" He said: "Too old? When you call me to join the war, I can't be a cook or clerk, I have to participate." He joined the militia, and the masses all called him "Old Clerk." In addition, the care for military dependents and demobilized soldiers is also very thorough. For example, 20 military dependents in Liucun were allocated land and livestock, and demobilized soldier Su Defu was allocated all furniture, houses, and land. The experiences for achieving such results in the 40-day movement are: (1) Boldly and freely mobilizing the masses is the mass line of combining the leadership with the masses. For example, Comrade Zhang Chengjiao, political commissar of the Second District, said: "At the beginning, I didn't believe that the masses could do well, but in fact, the masses did very well." (2) Thoroughly eliminate feudalism and unite all peasants. To thoroughly eliminate feudalism, it is necessary to unite all peasants. For example, Xiaowen rejected the offering of middle peasant Liu Xiaozhao, and the struggle became more active, holding meetings during the day and carrying manure in the morning.

    调整干群关系深入发动落后
    平顺普遍完成土地改革
    五个区农民收回土地一万六千亩
    一千五百余户赤贫贫农上升中农
    【本报平顺消息】平顺于去冬十二月初即开始了实现耕者有其田运动，到一月十号前后四十天的时间，在全县范围内普遍的完成了土地改革，运动开始时，领导上即明确提出割尾巴填窟窿的口号，干部们即深入到山庄窝铺，面向窟窿户，发动落后层。如一区龙峪沟发现了一户九口人，住在地窖中，并且都没穿上棉衣。一面深入山庄窝铺，一面即解决干部与群众关系，并在广大农民中宣传土地政策，特别是反复宣传了中农政策，稳定了中农情绪，积极参加了斗争，这一时期共五天到十天的时间。经过酝酿成熟找出尾巴后，即进入大斗争时期，组织了诉苦发现问题，进一步的深入找尾巴，选翻身委员会，开斗争会，集中保管果实。这一阶段也大约有五天到七天。斗争结束后即分配果实，作法是评议讨论，选举保管委员会分配委员会，公布展览果实，开庆祝会，总结、评选英雄模范、算翻身账，最后组织起来进行生产。四十天来据五个区的统计（缺三、五区），农民从地主手中收回土地一万六千五百五十八亩，房屋八千三百一十二间，粮食四万零九百石，牲口二千二百六十一头，羊子一万七千五百九十九只，衣服家具等共三万余件，共四万零四百九十三个农民获得了土地，一千五百八十二户赤贫农已上升为中农。在整个运动中，干部和群众都表现了高度的觉悟性，如龙峪沟武委会主任宋童则说：“过去是对果实多操心，对运动少操心；现在是对运动多操心，对果实就少操心”了，恰恰颠倒过来。如大渠李引科说：“过去老财有个‘毛财神’，咱们有三位‘活财神’——共产党、毛主席，八路军和村干部。”在群众的觉悟中，地主的尾巴也藏不住了。羊老岩就组织了三十多人专门到山沟里去找地主所藏的东西。一次在一个石崖中就找出食盐九百多斤，棉花六十多斤，布四十多斤，粮食二十石。总结翻身后，群众生产与武装情绪很高。下午井纺织运输赚洋九十万，羊井底赚洋五百余万，川底一个老汉郭桂成非叫他儿子参加民兵不可，儿子开始不愿意，老汉生气的要把果实送回去，并说：“你不参加民兵没人保卫，我要这东西干啥？”又如龙镇四十六岁的杨黑则要参加民兵，干部和民兵都说：“你年纪大啦！”他说：“年纪大啦？叫你们参战时我不能当火夫或事务长，非参加不行。”他参加了民兵群众皆呼之为“老事务长”，另外对军属荣退军人照顾也很周到，如留村二十户军属都分配了土地和牲口，荣退军人苏德福分得了全部家具房屋和土地，四十天运动所以获得如此成绩的经验是：（一）大胆放手发动群众是领导与群众相结合的群众路线。如二区政委张成蛟同志说：“开始总是不相信群众能搞好，但事实上群众弄的都很好。”（二）彻底消灭封建团结全体农民。想彻底消灭封建，也就必须团结全体农民。如孝文拒绝了中农刘小招献出后，斗争就较积极，白天开会，早晨担粪。
