　　Cadres Overcome Selfishness, Poor Households in Xiguan, Zuoquan Fill the Gap
　　[This newspaper reports] After the struggle to cut off the "tails" (referring to remnants of the landlord class) in Xiguan, Zuoquan County, a thorough mass inspection was carried out before the distribution of the fruits of victory. It was discovered that some people did not participate in the speaking bitterness meetings, and some who did, did not speak up. Economically, they were not completely liberated. Some cadres had a poor attitude towards the masses, and the masses were dissatisfied with the cadres and activists. This had to be seriously addressed in order to smoothly distribute the fruits of victory and complete the task of filling the gap (referring to leveling the economic disparity). Therefore, a meeting of cadres was convened for preliminary self-reflection. It was deemed that cadres who had made mistakes should first sincerely "wash their faces" with the masses. A meeting of those who had benefited was then convened to encourage the masses to offer their opinions on the distribution of the fruits of victory and the conduct of the cadres. Finally, a general review meeting was held between cadres and the masses to eliminate all estrangement. Sun Sanwan, a member of the Farmers' Association, was the first to frankly admit his mistakes to the masses, saying: "During the distribution of the fruits of victory at the meeting, I always stood in front, guarding my share, afraid that I wouldn't get something satisfactory. At first, it was decided to give me a donkey, and I was very happy. A few days later, it was decided not to give me a donkey but to give me an ox, and I wasn't very happy. Finally, the representatives discussed giving me only a sheep, and I was very unhappy, saying: 'I don't want it!' Now, when I compare myself with everyone, I feel that everyone was not being harsh on me by giving me a sheep. There are still many poor people like me who haven't been liberated. Only caring about myself and not taking enough care of my poor brothers is very wrong. At that time, there was also something I couldn't figure out, which was that the leadership repeatedly emphasized that cadres should not take too many fruits of victory. I felt that the leadership was not taking care of us enough, so I said that if we can't take the big things, what's the big deal about taking some small things? Now I realize that I really benefited from them. It's true that if you listen to the leadership, things will be done well." Cadre Li said: "Everyone elected me as a representative. Although I said I would distribute things reasonably and take care of everyone, I had selfish intentions. I gave the good things to relatives, neighbors, and those who were nice to me, and I picked the bad things for those who didn't speak up and those who were not close to me. Usually, I couldn't stand sneaky things. But during the distribution of the fruits of victory, I thought that since we are working here all day long, isn't it always 'passing through a government office and being exploited'? If we can't take the big things, what's the big deal about taking some small things? So I took two cowbells. Now I know I did wrong. Although the things are small, if the landlord knows about it, it will ruin the mood of us poor people." Then he took out the cowbells from his pocket and said repentantly to everyone: "I'm returning the cowbells. Please deal with me." At this point, old man Wang Yinzi said: "I used to hear about cadres 'washing their faces,' but I didn't believe it. I thought it was just empty talk. In the old society, would the village chief or deputy village chief apologize to anyone? It was simply impossible. Only in the places led by Chairman Mao is work done so seriously, and everything is for us poor people." One person said: "The cadres' self-criticism is not 'bad.' They are saying the truth. Now that they have admitted their mistakes and the matter has been clarified, they should do a good job in the future. We are all one family. Resolving the problem can't be like struggling against the landlords." One person said: "There's no need to return the things. Liberation doesn't depend on those worthless small things. But things were not done well, and it needs to be clarified. Originally, everyone sincerely relied on you to do things, but unexpectedly, you put a layer of bran in everyone's hearts. You are suspicious of me, and I am suspicious of you, so we are not of one mind. Now that this layer of bran has been removed, you should still wholeheartedly serve everyone. We are united again, and the bad guys can't exploit our weaknesses." As a result, the estrangement between cadres and the masses was eliminated, and those who had been silent became active. In an atmosphere of excitement and unity, the fruits of the struggle were distributed fairly, and the holes of the households that had not been liberated were filled. (Gui, Jin, Xiang, Hong)

　　干部打破自私观念左权西关贫户填平
    【本报讯】左权县西关经过割尾巴斗争，在分果实前，进行群众性的深入检查，发现有些群众没有参加诉苦，有的参加了也不吭气，他们在经济上也没翻透身。某些干部对群众态度不好，群众不满干部、积极分子，必须认真解决，才能顺利分果实、完成填补。于是召开了干部会，进行初步反省，认为犯错误干部应先向群众认真洗脸。大会又召开得利户会议，启发群众对分果实与干部作风等问题提意见。然后干部与群众开总检讨会，解除一切隔阂。农会委员孙三弯首先坦白地向群众承认错误说：“大会分果实时，我总站在跟前守着，怕自己分不上合意的东西。起先决定分给我一头驴，我很高兴。过几天，又确定不给驴，要给我分牛，就不大乐意。最后代表们讨论只分给我羊，我就很不乐意地说：‘我不要啦！’现在我和大家一比，觉得大家分给我羊，对自己并不刻薄，还有许多像咱一样的穷，没翻身呢。光管自己，照顾穷弟兄不够，是很不对的。那时我还有一件事也没闹通，就是领导上一再提干部们不能多分果，我嫌领导上太不照顾咱，就说大东西不能拿吧，拿点小东西还算什么大事？现在才觉得倒底是沾了人家光啦，真是听了领导话，事情办不差。”干部李某说：“大家选我当代表，嘴里虽说要合理分配，照顾大家，可是我存着私心，把好东西分给亲戚邻家和对事人，坏的就拣给不吭气的和关系疏远的人。平常我最见不得偷偷摸摸的事。可是分果实时，我却以为咱成天在里边办事，什么时候不是‘过一道衙门剥一道利’？大东西不拿吧，取点小的有哈关系？我就拿了两个牛铃。现在才知道办错了。东西虽小，可是让地主知道了，就给咱穷人败兴啦。”接着他就从身上掏出牛铃，忏悔地对大家说：“我把牛铃退出来，请大家处理我。”至此，王银子老汉说：“我以前听说叫干部洗脸，就不相信。以为是灌米汤。旧社会里，村长村副还给人家认错？根本就不可能。只有毛主席领导的地方，办事才这样认真，事事为咱穷人。”一个说：“干部们检讨得不‘赖’，说的都是实在话。他们既认了错，事情已闹清楚，以后好好办事好了。咱们都是一家人，解疙瘩可不能像斗地主一样。”一个说：“东西也不用还了。翻身不翻身倒不在乎那些不值钱的小东西，可是事情是办的不好，得弄清楚，本来众人都实心靠你们办事，不想你们这一来就给大家心上垫了一层麸，你防我，我猜你，就不一心啦，现在这层麸弄掉了，你们还是贴贴实实为大家办事吧。咱们又团结起来，坏人没法钻咱们的空子。”结果干部和群众间的隔阂消除，不吭气的也积极起来。在兴奋团结的气氛中，公平地分配了斗争果实。填平了没翻身户的窟窿。（贵、晋、祥、鸿）
