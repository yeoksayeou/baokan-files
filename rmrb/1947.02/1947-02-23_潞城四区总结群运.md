　　Lucheng Fourth District Summarizes Mass Movement
    [Report from Lucheng] After two months of in-depth movement in the fourth district of this county, extreme poverty has been eliminated, and most of the poor peasants have been promoted to middle peasants. The remaining vestiges of landlord rule in the countryside have been destroyed. On the 10th of this month, more than 1,000 village cadres, women activists, and militia activists were convened to summarize the mass movement, launch a mass ideological turnaround movement, and raise class consciousness. At the meeting, many cadres and heroes of liberation took the lead in examining their own thoughts or recalling their past poor times to make a total accusation of suffering. For example, Zhang Minsheng, a cadre from Chitou Village, reflected on his past as a hired laborer and shepherd for landlords. After the Communist Party came, he was liberated and became a cadre. He said: "The landlord used beautiful women to buy me off and protect the landlord. I am really sorry to the poor. I will definitely correct myself in the future and serve the masses better." Wei Baowen from Yanlizhuang used his own experience in the new and old societies to say: "In the old society, I was completely bare. Now I have land, a wife, and children. This is all given to me by Chairman Mao. I will never forget him even if I die!" Everyone unanimously believed that: not only must their own ideology be turned around, but the ideology of their parents, wives, and children must also be thoroughly turned around in order to truly live a good life."

　　潞城四区总结群运
    【本报潞城讯】本县四区经两个月深入运动，赤贫绝迹，贫农亦大部升为中农，地主在农村中的统治残余已被摧毁。特于本月十日召集村干部，妇女、民兵积极分子等一千余人总结群运，开展思想大翻身运动，提高阶级觉悟。会上，许多干部、翻身英雄均带头检查自己思想或回忆自己过去的穷时光来一次总诉苦。如赤头村干部张民生反省从前给地主当雇工，放羊，共产党来了翻了身，当了干部。他说：“地主用美女收买过我，包庇地主，真对不起穷人，以后一定改好，更好为群众办事”。阎里庄魏保文用自己在新、旧社会的经历来说：“旧社会里光净光，现在有了地，有了老婆有了孩子，这都是毛主席给我的，我死也忘不了他”！大家一致认为：不但自己思想上要翻身，自己的父母、老婆、孩子的思想上也都要翻透身，才能真正地过好光景。”（席兴福）
