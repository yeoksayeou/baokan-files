Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, Urgent Telegram, 24th: The East China People's Liberation Army, in the Shandong Campaign, first annihilated 50,000 Chiang's troops in the northern line within 65 hours, achieving an unprecedented victory since the self-defense war. According to the No. 11 Communiqué of the Headquarters of the East China People's Liberation Army: Our field army, from the evening of the 20th to 5 p.m. on the 23rd, counterattacked the invading Chiang's troops in the Laiwu area north of central Shandong, annihilating two reorganized armies (under the jurisdiction of six divisions) and one reorganized division of Chiang's troops, a total of seven divisions. This is a great achievement of our army in grasping the strategic initiative and voluntarily abandoning Linyi. After Chiang Kai-shek gained Linyi without a fight, he greatly hyped up the so-called "victory" and attempted to join forces with the troops of Li Xianzhou, deputy director of the Jinan Pacification Headquarters, to encircle and annihilate our army in the central Shandong mountainous area. After this counterattack, the headquarters of the Kuomintang's 73rd Army, under the command of Li Xianzhou, and its subordinate 15th Division, 77th Division, and 193rd Division (Note: This army received U.S. military training in 1945, all equipped with U.S. weaponry. It was airlifted from Xuzhou to Jinan in June last year and actively engaged in the civil war), the headquarters of the 46th Army and its subordinate New 19th Division, 175th Division, and 188th Division (Note: The 46th Army, also known as the Reorganized 46th Division, was reorganized from the original 16th Army Group of the Gui Faction under Xia Wei, and was transported from Hainan Island to Qingdao in late October last year), and the New 36th Division of the 12th Army, a total of seven reorganized divisions, together with Li Xianzhou's headquarters, totaling more than 50,000 people, were completely wiped out, and dozens of important towns such as Xintai, Laiwu, and Tusikou were recovered. A complete victory was achieved in the first stage of the Shandong Campaign, and the personnel and weapons of the annihilated and captured Chiang's troops will be announced to the people of the whole country in the near future.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th: The Shandong Liberated Area is urgently mobilized to organize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources to meet Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive against southern Shandong. Support-the-frontline headquarters at all levels have been successively established. The Shandong Provincial Support-the-Frontline Committee has dispatched capable cadres to various places in Binhai, central Shandong, and southern Shandong to help with the work. The rear organs have thoroughly streamlined administration and troops to adapt to the war environment. More than 1,000 cadres directly under the East China Bureau of the Communist Party of China have gone to the front-line villages, and hundreds of thousands of militiamen are enthusiastically heading to predetermined locations to support the battle. The military and civilians in the rear are saving food and clothing, overcoming difficulties, and assisting the front line. Old people, children, and women are all participating in production to consolidate the rear order. Women in Shalutou Village, Junan, share administrative work so that the support-the-frontline work is not affected. In Shengliang Village, Yinan County, central Shandong, 71% of the village's labor force has been organized to participate in mutual aid. They push carts, carry manure, and plow the land with high morale. The military and civilians in the war zone thoroughly carry out emptying the houses and fields, and launch guerrilla warfare and the explosive movement. When Linyi was evacuated, even coffins were buried. The Tanxian explosion team buried hundreds of landmines from Honghuabu to Jichuan, killing and wounding more than 100 Chiang's soldiers. In central Shandong, when Chiang's troops first attacked Laiwu, 60 landmines collapsed and exploded, killing and wounding more than 40 soldiers below the regimental and battalion levels, forcing Chiang's 96th Army's 12th Division and part of the 111th Division, a total of four regiments, to guard the Zhang (Qiu) Lai (Wu) highway, but under the harassment and attacks of the military and civilians, it was difficult to pass.

　　华东自卫空前大捷我歼灭蒋军七个师
    【新华社华东前线二十四日急电】华东人民解放军，在山东会战中，首于北线在六十五小时内歼灭蒋军五万，获得自卫战争以来之空前大捷。据华东人民解放军总部第十一号公报称：我野战军自二十日晚至二十三日下午五时，在鲁中莱芜以北地区反击进犯蒋军，一举歼灭蒋军两个整军（辖六个师）及一个整师，共七个师。这是我军掌握战略主动、自动放弃临沂后的伟大收获；蒋介石不战而得临沂后，曾大肆喧嚣所谓“胜利”，并企图与济南绥署副主任李仙洲所部南北夹击我军于鲁中山区；经此次反击，李仙洲指挥下之蒋嫡系七十三军军部及所辖之十五师、七十七师、一百九十三师（按：该军于一九四五年曾受美军事训练，全部为美械装备，去年六月由徐州空运济南，积极从事内战），四十六军军部及所辖以新十九师、一百七十五师、一百八十八师（按：四十六军即整编四十六师，为原桂系十六集团军夏威部所改编，去年十月下旬由海南岛运抵青岛），及十二军之新三十六师共七个整师、连同李仙洲总部，总计五万余人全部就歼，并收复新泰、莱芜、吐丝口镇等重要城镇数十处，取得了山东会战第一阶段的全胜，被歼俘蒋军之人员武器当于近日向全国人民公布。
    【新华社山东廿五日电】山东解放区紧急动员起来，组织一切人力物力财力迎接蒋介石对鲁南大规模的进攻，各级支援前线司令部已相继成立。山东省支援前线委员会派出得力干部，分赴滨海、鲁中、鲁南各地帮助工作，后方机关彻底精兵精政，适应战争环境，仅中共华东局直属机关即有千余干部到前线区村去，数十万民兵正热烈开赴预定地点支援战斗。后方军民节衣缩食、克服困难、援助前线，老幼妇女一齐参加生产巩固后方秩序，莒南沙炉头村妇女分担行政工作，使支援前线工作不受影响。鲁中沂南县圣良庄已组织全庄人口百分之七十一的劳动力参加变工，他们推车、担粪、刨地翻土，情绪高昂，战地军民则彻底进行空室清野，展开游击战爆炸运动，临沂撤退时连棺材都埋藏起来，郯县爆炸队自红花埠至岌川一线，共埋地雷数百颗，毙伤蒋军百余名，鲁中方面，蒋军第一次进攻莱芜时，坍踏响地雷六十余枚，死伤团营以下四十余名，迫使蒋军九十六军十二师全部及一百十一师一部共四个团的兵力掩护章（邱）莱（芜）公路，但在军民困扰袭击下，终难通行。
