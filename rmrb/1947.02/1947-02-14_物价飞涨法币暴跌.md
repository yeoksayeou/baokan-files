【Another Dispatch】 Shanghai News: The Chiang government announced new measures on February 3rd regarding import and export trade, namely, imposing an additional tax of 50% on all imported goods except machinery, rice, wheat, cotton, and fertilizer, and providing a 100% subsidy for export commodities. As a result, the prices of gold, US dollars, and daily necessities in Nanjing and Shanghai immediately soared. Within a week, gold rose from over 400,000 to over 600,000, an increase of about 50%; the US dollar rose from 7,800 to 13,500, an increase of over 70%. Daily necessities generally rose by 50% to 100%. Economic figures in Shanghai pointed out that the Chiang government's adoption of this measure is due to the fact that the trade deficit of 400 to 500 million US dollars in the past year has brought the Chiang government's foreign exchange fund of 500 million US dollars, established last spring, close to exhaustion. Therefore, it attempts to dig a well only when thirsty to ease the trade deficit and even swindle overseas Chinese. At the same time, this measure is a cruel method for the four major families to amass the people's blood and sweat. On the one hand, the four major families have monopolized export trade through the "Export Promotion Committee" and "Unified Purchase and Sales Method," and the export subsidies mainly subsidize the four families themselves. On the other hand, the comprador trusts of the four major families who deal in American goods, such as the "Sino-American Industrial Company" jointly established by Soong Mei-ling and Claire Chennault, Soong Tzu-wen's "Kinshan Company," Kung Hsiang-hsi's "Yangtze Construction Company," and Chen Li-fu's "Taiping Xingye Company," have hoarded a large amount of American goods and obtained exorbitant profits of 50% to 100% due to the import tax increase. The burden of the soaring prices of goods caused by the import tax increase falls on the common people. However, it is fundamentally impossible for the Chiang government to use this measure to ease the trade deficit. As for export trade, according to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th, the Chiang government's export subsidy plan is almost doomed to failure from the start. First, the increase in prices is enough to offset these subsidies; second, the US side has already notified the Chinese side (referring to the Chiang government) that all Chinese goods entering the US market must pay an additional tax equivalent to the subsidy (i.e., collect an additional tax of 100%).

    物价飞涨法币暴跌
    【又电】沪讯：蒋政府于本月三日宣布对进出口贸易的新措施，即除机器、米、麦、棉花、肥料外，对一切进口货均课以百分之五十的附加税，对出口商品则予以百分之百的补贴。此举结果，立刻引起京沪黄金美钞和生活用品之涨价，一周内黄金已由四十余万涨至六十余万，约涨百分之五十；美钞已由七千八百涨至一万三千五，计涨百分之七十以上。日用品则一般涨了百分之五十到百分之百。沪上经济界人士指出：蒋政府之采取此项措施，是由于一年来四、五亿美元之入超，已使蒋政府去年春间设立的五亿美元的外汇基金临近涸竭，遂图临渴掘井以缓和入超，甚至套取侨胞；同时，此举又为四大家族搜刮人民血汗的残酷办法。一方面四大家族经过“输出推广委员会”及“统购统销办法”而垄断了出口贸易，出口补贴主要是补贴了四大家自己。另一方面，四大家的买办美货的托辣斯如宋美龄与陈纳德合组的“中美实业公司”，宋子文的“金山公司”，孔祥熙的“扬子建业公司”，陈立夫的“太平兴业公司”等，已囤积了大量的美国货，因进口加税而取得了百分之五十至一百的暴利。而进口加税结果所引起的百货狂涨，其负担均落在老百姓的身上。但蒋政府要借此举以缓和入超，根本不可能。至于出口贸易，据美联社南京九日电称：蒋政府贴补出口计划，几乎一开始即注定要失败。第一、物价增高足以抵消此等贴款；第二、美方又已通知中国方面（指蒋政府）所有进入美国市场之中国货物皆须支付相等于补助金之附加税（按即征收百分之百的附加税）。
