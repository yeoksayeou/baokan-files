　　Model Squad Leader Yu Daiquan Creates
    Experience in Transforming Liberated Soldiers

    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] Under the transformation of Model Squad Leader Yu Daiquan of a certain unit, the liberated soldiers who joined his squad quickly transformed into loyal and brave people's fighters. He created the following experiences: First, stabilizing the emotions of liberated soldiers. When liberated soldier Ding Xiaoyuan first arrived at the squad, he felt he was an "outsider." Squad Leader Yu introduced himself as an "outsider" as well, took special care of him, and helped him solve difficulties. When he didn't have a face towel, he gave him one of his own. This initially stabilized Ding Xiaoyuan's emotions and laid the foundation for his transformation. Second, starting with small truths and moving to big principles. Although Ding Xiaoyuan no longer considered himself an "outsider," he was very homesick. Squad Leader Yu explained to him: "Who doesn't have a home? But if we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we can't go home. If we go back, they'll just arrest us again, and we'll still suffer." Ding Xiaoyuan slowly came to understand this and became a brave fighter. Third, constantly instilling Chairman Mao's military thought is the basic method of consolidating the troops. Once, the unit arrived in Hongdong and camped one mile away from the Chiang army, awaiting an opportunity to fight. Later, they retreated to the mountains. Liberated soldier Liu Linbao became suspicious. Squad Leader Yu took the initiative to explain to him: "This is because the enemy is concentrating all its forces to attack. They won't be able to hold out for long." A few days later, our troops indeed descended the mountain again. Liu Linbao was convinced by the reasoning of Squad Leader Yu. Fourth, caring about their daily lives. Once, the unit launched an attack from Wangtao to Yuerquan, and Liu Linbao had a stomach ache. Squad Leader Yu took care of him all the way, preventing him from drinking cold water, boiling water for him, and asking the medic for medicine for him.

　　模范班长余代全创造
    改造解放战士经验
    【本报太岳十七日电】在某部模范班长余代全的改造下，参加该班的解放战士很快都转变为忠勇的人民战士，他创造了下面几个经验：第一、稳定解放战士的情绪。解放战士丁小原初到该班时，认为自己是“外路人”，余班长就介绍自己也是“外路人”，对他特别关心，给他解决困难，他没洗脸手巾，就把自己的一块送他。初步地稳定了丁小原的情绪，给改造打下了基础。第二、从小道理说到大道理。丁小原虽不再认为自己是“外路人”，但很想家，余班长又给他解释：“谁没家？可是不打败蒋介石，有家也回不得，回去了人家又来抓去，还不是受罪”？丁小原才慢慢想通了，成为勇敢的战士。第三、随时随地灌输毛主席的军事思想，这是巩固部队的基本办法。有回部队到洪洞，离蒋军一里地住下来，待机作战。后又撤到山上。解放战士刘林保怀疑起来。余班长主动向他解释：“这是敌人集中所有兵力来犯，不会长久稳住的。”过几天，果然我部队又下了山。刘林保信服了余班长讲的道理。第四、关心他们的日常生活。有次部队从王陶出击渔儿泉，刘林保肚痛，余班长一路照顾他，不让他喝凉水，给他烧开水，向卫生员要药给他吃。
