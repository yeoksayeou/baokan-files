　　Huangqiao Public Cooperative
    Expands Business During Anti-"Encirclement and Suppression"

    The Huangqiao Public Cooperative, which persists in the Jiang-occupied area of ​​Central Jiangsu, continues to expand its business in the midst of the anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign. The cooperative was originally located in Huangqiao City and was formed by 4,320 households of citizens who raised funds. Since Huangqiao was occupied by the Jiang army in July last year, it has moved to the countryside with the citizens to continue operating. Nearby residents abandoned Huangqiao to buy goods from the cooperative, forming a stark contrast to the desolate Huangqiao City under Jiang's occupation. When the Jiang army conducted "encirclement and suppression" with Huangqiao as the center, the cooperative dispersed its members to carry baskets, shoulder poles, and push carts to do guerrilla business in various rural areas. Refugees fleeing from the Jiang-occupied areas also joined the cooperative to work, engaging in business while publicizing the crimes of the Jiang army. Slogans such as "The Public Cooperative is doing mobile business, persisting in anti-'encirclement and suppression,' and transactions must be in 'Resistance Currency'" frequently appeared on the streets of Huangqiao. When the situation was tense, the cooperative staff carried goods and moved with the guerrilla groups. Whenever they arrived at a location, the guerrillas set up guard, and the cooperative conducted transactions with the local residents. In case of enemy activity, the guerrillas immediately attacked, and the cooperative and the masses safely evacuated. Sometimes, it also cooperated in combat, mobilizing customers to carry stretchers to the front line several times. Its business scope has expanded from the vicinity of Huangqiao to twenty or thirty li away. Goods are sold at 20% off the market price, but so far, it has already earned a surplus of more than 400,000 catties of wheat. Now, the people around Huangqiao consider the Communist Party, the New Fourth Army, the democratic government, and the Public Cooperative as their benefactors. The main reasons for the cooperative's success are two: First, it seeks benefits for the masses, with shareholders and citizens advancing and retreating together, and staff truly serving as public servants of the people; second, it adapts to the environment, transforms its business methods, and becomes a part of the combat force itself. Therefore, even in the extremely tense anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle, it only feels convenient and does not become a burden. Now, the cooperative has become a new direction for persisting in and developing the cooperative cause in the guerrilla areas.

### 黄桥大众合作社  反清剿中扩展营业

　　黄桥大众合作社
    反清剿中扩展营业
    【新华社华中二十九日电】坚持苏中蒋军侵占区的黄桥大众合作社，在反“清剿”中仍不断扩展营业。该社原设黄桥市，由四千三百二十户市民集资组成。自去年七月黄桥为蒋军侵占后，随市民转移到农村继续经营，附近居民都撇开黄桥争往该社买货，与蒋占处顿形冷落的黄桥市成一强烈对照。蒋军以黄桥为中心进行“清剿”，该社即将社员分散携篮、挑担、推车到各农村去做游击生意，从蒋占区逃出的难民，亦加入该社工作，一面做买卖，一面宣传蒋军罪行。黄桥街头经常出现“大众合作社流动做买卖，坚持反‘清剿’，交易要‘抗币’”等标语。情况紧张时，该社人员即背着货物与游击小组一起行动。每到一地，游击队布好警戒，合作社与当地居民进行交易，一遇敌情，游击队立刻出击，合作社和群众就安全转移，有时它还配合作战，曾几次动员顾客带担架上前线，其营业范围已由黄桥附近扩展到二三十里外。货物仅按市价八折出售，但迄今已盈余小麦四十余万斤。现在黄桥周围人民心目中的恩人除共产党、新四军和民主政府外，就是大众合作社。该社成功的主要原因有二：一、是为群众谋利益，股东市民同进同退，职员亦真正做人民的公仆；二、是适应环境，转变营业方式，本身成为战斗体的一部分，因此虽在极紧张的反“清剿”斗争中，仍只感便利而不成为累赘。现该社已成为坚持与发展游击区合作事业的新方向。
