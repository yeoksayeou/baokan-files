    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 5th: According to a delayed Shanghai Wenhui Bao report dated January 5th: The Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association issued a statement on Chiang's "Constitution," pointing out that the "National Assembly" unilaterally convened by the Kuomintang government was neither freely and universally elected by the people, nor was it convened in accordance with the resolutions and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference. It not only cannot represent the people of the whole country, but also infringes upon the rights and interests of the people of the whole country. The statement continued: "The Chinese people have forty years of painful and failed constitutional experience, and today they know that a truly democratic constitution is not bestowed upon the people by the rulers; moreover, they know that when democratic forces are on the rise, the rulers will play a set of democratic tricks to oppress the people and divide the democratic camp. Now, another set of Nanjing "Constitution" has been published. When the people measure it with a historical perspective, how does it differ from Cao Kun's bribery-elected "Constitution"? The people have awakened and will not fall into the trap. The constitution is the sacred fundamental law of the country, and it must be formulated for the purpose of realizing peace, unity, democracy, and unification, and to enable the people to obtain freedom and to protect their rights. Therefore, standing on the position of Sanmin Zhuyi believers, we solemnly declare that the Nanjing Constitution is immediately invalid!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 5th: Beiping News: On January 17th, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published an editorial criticizing the false provisions regarding the people's rights in Chiang's "Constitution." The editorial pointed out: The provisions of Article 23 of Chiang's Constitution show that "the government can restrict the scope of the people's freedom and rights by invoking various 'necessary' 'laws and regulations,' which is still so broad." The newspaper criticized the current Kuomintang government's various retrogressive acts in culture, stating: "Newspaper and magazine registration is difficult, and distribution is difficult after registration. There are all kinds of restrictions and nitpicking. In addition, various places arbitrarily list banned books. Liberal and pro-democracy publications are sealed up or closed down, institutions are destroyed, and people are beaten, resulting in cultural decline and the poverty of writers." And in politics: "Under the pretext of 'dissenting party members plotting wrongdoing' and 'maintaining social order,' people's gatherings are arbitrarily suppressed, prohibited, or dissolved." The newspaper called for "genuine personal freedom, spiritual freedom, and freedom of assembly."

    三民主义同志会发表声明
    宣布不承认蒋宪有效
    大公报抨击蒋介石绞杀人权
    【新华社延安五日电】据迟到之上海文汇报一月五日消息：三民主义同志联合会对蒋记“宪法”发表声明，指出此次国民政府片面召开的“国大”既非由人民自由普选产生，又违反政协决议与其程序而召集，这不仅不能代表全国民众，且侵害全国人民的权益，继称：“中国人民有四十年惨痛失败的制宪经验，今天知道真正民主宪法不是靠统治者赐予人民的；更知道民主力量在高涨时期、统治者会玩弄一套民主的戏法来欺压人民、分化民主阵势的。现在又公布了一套南京“宪法”，在人民面前用历史眼光把它衡量一下，试问比曹锟的贿选“宪法”有何相异呢？人民已经醒悟了，是不会入圈套的。宪法为国家神圣的根本大法，必须在实现和平团结民主统一的前提下使人民得到自由，为保障他们的权利而制定。因此，我们站在三民主义信徒的立场上郑重声明，立即宣布南京宪法无效！”
    【新华社延安五日电】北平讯：一月十七日天津大公报发表社论，批评蒋记“宪法”中关于人民权利之虚伪规定。社论指出：蒋宪第二十三条之规定，说明“政府可借口各种‘必需’之‘法规’以限制人民自由权利之范围，还是那么广泛。”该报抨击目前国民党政府在文化上的各种倒行逆施称：“报纸刊物登记困难，登记了发行困难，种种束缚，样样挑剔，再加上各地乱列禁书，自由主义及主张民主的出版物封的封、倒的倒，机关被捣毁，人被殴打，弄得文化衰落，作家贫穷。”以及政治上：“借口‘异党分子图谋不轨’，及‘维持社会秩序’等，滥加取缔、禁止或解散人民集会。”呼吁：“真正的人身自由、精神自由、集会自由”。
