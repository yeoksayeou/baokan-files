[Reported from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 13th] In Ge'@ Village, Qin County, during the Third Great Flowering Struggle, precise allocation methods were adopted for the fruits of the struggle, ensuring that poor farmers had land to cultivate and houses to live in. First, land allocation methods: 1. Allocation based on land yield. All land in the village was divided into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. Then, based on this standard, each household was investigated to determine their level of land self-sufficiency. Land from the fruits of war was used to supplement this, and appropriate consideration was given to veterans and their families. 2. Determine households eligible for land and the amount they should receive, while also appropriately considering the quality, distance, and even distribution of land. Those with upper-grade land received lower-grade land, those with lower-grade land received upper-grade land, those with middle-grade land received middle-grade land, and those with no land received middle-grade land. Those without labor received nearby land. 3. Resolve land mortgage issues. Land mortgaged by landlords to landless or land-poor farmers was entirely given to the mortgagees. If this was insufficient, it was further supplemented. Land mortgaged by landlords to middle or rich peasants was divided in half, with the mortgagees keeping half and the remaining half being handled by the masses. For land mortgaged between farmers, the amount was calculated by each party receiving half when calculating supplementary land. If this was insufficient, it could be supplemented, but the mortgage relationship still existed. After this land allocation, all hired laborers, tenants, poor people, veterans, and their families in the village rose to the level of middle peasants. Second, house allocation methods: priority was given to veterans, their families, and landless poor farmers, and then to households lacking houses. Other furniture and grain allocation methods involved dividing the villagers into nine grades based on wealth and distributing items based on their value, taking into account all classes.

    按产量评定调剂远近
    圪塔村精确分田
    【本报太岳十三日电】沁县圪＠村，在第三次大开花斗争中，对果实采取精确的分配办法，使贫苦农民户户有地种、有房住。第一、土地分配办法：一、按土地产量分配，将全村所有的土地划分为上中下三等。然后再根据这个标准逐户调查，确定每户土地自给程度，以战争果实中的土地进行填补，并适当照顾荣退军人及军属。二、确定应得土地户及应得数目等，并适当照顾土地的好坏远近均匀，如有上等地者填下等地，下等地填上等地，中等地者配中等地，根本无地者分中等地，无劳力者分近地。三、解决典地问题，地主典与无地或少地农民之土地，其土地全部归承当人，如不足者再填补。地主与给中农或富农之土地，承典人留一半，其余一半交群众处理。农民与农民间之典当土地，在计算填补时，双方各按一半计算，不足时可填补，但典当关系仍存在。如此分配土地后，全村所有之雇佃贫及荣退军人，全部上升为中农。第二、房屋分配办法：先尽荣退军人军属及无房之贫农分配，然后再填补房屋缺少户。其他家具等物及粮食分配法，是将全村群众按贫富划分为九等，以实物作价分配，照顾了各个阶层。
