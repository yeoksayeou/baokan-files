(This report from Taiyue, 17th) According to people recently arrived from Luoyang: The people of Luoyang are finding it hard to survive due to the heavy burden of taxation and rampant bandits. Although the authorities are currently loudly advocating for strengthened public security, the phenomenon of resisting grain levies and evading conscription is gradually increasing, and the disorder of society is becoming more serious. In addition, they are busy with construction projects, which has caused further unease and dissatisfaction among the people.

The conscription began in October of last year, with each "bao" (unit of collective responsibility) required to provide six, five, or four men, respectively. By December, it was ten men per "bao". The price of a conscripted man rose from 500,000 to 1,600,000 (currency not specified). Generally, each "bao" was short by about half. The county government ordered that all quotas be met by the end of the year, causing widespread panic.

Those collecting grain levies searched households indiscriminately, kicking, hitting, and cursing. They would take away corn and mung beans if they saw them. The two-year income of a poor farmer was equivalent to 580 jin of refined grain, but the burden for ten months last year was 295 jin. Deficiencies mounted monthly, and levies were exacted daily, leaving the common people with insurmountable debts. Upon hearing the sound of gongs signaling the arrival of the collectors, they would flee. They would hide outside during the day and only return home to sleep late at night. The diet of most farmers consisted of thin sweet potato porridge for breakfast and dinner, or boiled sweet potatoes. They might have a watery mixed flour noodle soup with little oil and lots of salt every three or four days.

The months of July, August, and September last year were the "central period" of "public security" in Luoyang. Since October, there have been five types of local defense teams: the Training Corps, the Security Brigade, the County Direct-Controlled Company, the Township Direct-Controlled Company, and the Guard Team. There was also a planned spear and pole team (刀矛队) which was not yet established (all men aged twelve to sixty were to be incorporated). In the entire Luoyang area, there were six "security zones" and six new police stations, and checkpoints were set up at important river crossings – a great variety of measures. In addition to the Kuomintang's military statistics office, there was a newly established Sino-American Reception Center. Each township also newly established a New Life Movement Promotion Association (many townships have not yet implemented it), strictly ordering the central principal to serve as the branch president, specifically to counter the resistance of the people.

However, since October, local order has further deteriorated, with robbery cases emerging endlessly! Four households in Duzhai were robbed, one household in Changcun, one in Daosi, one in Lijiazhuang, and three hostages were taken for ransom in Chen'ao. There were even more cases of murder: one person was beaten to death in Qilihe, west of the city; four members of a family in Yaogou; one person in Shangxuma; one person in Dongsiyuan; three people in Xibanzhenzhuang... Robberies frequently occurred on the road from Luoyang to Xi'an, and few people traveled the road after sunset. Feng Hanzhang, a landlord, merchant, and usurer in Licun Township, is now building ten blockhouses while planning to divide the family property and sell land in order to escape.

　　暗无天日的洛阳
    【本报太岳十七日电】据最近洛阳来人谈：洛阳人民因负担繁重，盗匪横行，闹得难以生活下去。当前虽然当局正在高唱加强治安工作，而抗粮款躲征兵的现象，仍逐渐增多，社会秩序的紊乱情况更加严重。加上他们忙于建筑工事，更引起人民的不安和不满。
    征兵从去年十月份开始，每保六个、五个、四个不等。十二月份每保十名。壮丁身价每名由五十万涨到一百六十万，各保普遍的欠一半左右。县府勒令一定年底交齐，人心惶惶。
    摧粮款的挨户乱搜，踢打叫骂，见到了玉茭绿豆也拿走。某户贫农的两年收入合细粮五百八十斤，但去年十个月的负担，就出二百九十五斤。月月欠，天天摧，老百姓欠账还不清了。听见打锣的就逃走了。白天出外躲，后半夜才能回家睡。大多的农民生活是早晚两顿红薯稀糊汤，或白水煮红薯，三四天一顿菜多盐少的糊糊杂面条，不吃一点油水。
    去年七八九三个月，是洛阳“治安”的“中心时期”，从十月份以来，有五种地方团队，即集训总队、保安大队、县直属中队、乡直属中队、守卫队，还有一个下令未办的刀矛队（从十二岁至六十岁的男子均编入）。全洛阳六个“治安区”，增设六个警察局，河口要道设盘查哨，花样多极了。特务机关除长官部军事调统室，国民党部调统室外，新设了一个中美招待所，各乡又新设一新生活运动促进会（很多乡尚未执行），严令中心校长任分会会长，专门对付人民的反抗行动。
    可是，从十月份以来，地方秩序更形紊乱了，抢案层出不穷！杜寨被抢四户，常村一户、导寺上一户、李家庄一户，陈凹被拉肉票三个，人命案更多，城西七里河打死一人、瑶沟一户四口人、上徐马一人、东四园一人、西半针庄三人、……。由洛阳至西安之汽车路上，时常发生劫路事件，太阳快落路人就稀少了。李村乡大地主奸商兼高利贷者冯汉章，现正一面建筑十个炮楼，一面计划分家卖地逃之夭夭。
