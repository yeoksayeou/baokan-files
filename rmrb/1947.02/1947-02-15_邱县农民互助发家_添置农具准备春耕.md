    Qiu County Farmers Get Rich Through Mutual Aid
    Adding Farm Tools to Prepare for Spring Plowing
    [Report from our newspaper in Qiu County, 12th] Through organized mutual aid production, Qiu County farmers have freed themselves from poverty and are living a life of plenty, and are now actively preparing for spring plowing. In 1943, Qiu County suffered from five disasters (enemy, hail, locusts, drought, and floods). In 1944, locusts occurred again, and in 1945, some areas were hit by hail. The lives of farmers were much more difficult than in any other part of southern Hebei. With the active help of the government, and after three years of production and disaster relief, the vast number of farmers organized transportation, textile production, and labor mutual aid, and their lives have all improved. In 1946, the Administrative Office made Qiu County the key county for leading production, and the Qiu County leading organs also concentrated their efforts on leading production, on a scale exceeding any previous year. According to incomplete statistics, there are 1,061 mutual aid groups in the county, with a total of 8,957 people, accounting for more than 15 percent of the county's population. Of the county's 2,557 livestock, 1,321 participated in mutual aid. In the 35 villages of the first district, every village has mutual aid groups, with a total of 274 groups. In Xiyaozitou in the second district, under the leadership of labor hero Wang Liansheng, land yields have increased. Last year's harvest was enough for ten households to use for two years, sixteen households enough for one and a half years, and four households enough for half a year. In the production movement, most villages attach great importance to sideline occupations, and most mutual aid groups are combined with sideline occupations, such as making tofu, grinding flour, ginning cotton, spinning cotton, transportation, salt extraction, steamed bun shops, carpentry shops, making cattle ropes, etc., thus increasing income and gradually moving towards a life of plenty. Nanliu Village encouraged twenty single men and widows to participate in mutual aid by solving the difficulties of widow Jiao Wangshi and bachelor Li Tonghai. A widow in Xinge Village said, "People always say that you can't live without a man, but I feel that you can't live without a mutual aid group." At present, all villages have begun to repair houses, build walls, buy cattle, raise pigs, and prepare farm tools. Matou now has forty-two cattle and plans to buy twenty more this year. Many farm tools have also been added. The vast number of farmers are all beaming with joy, busy building new homes and preparing for spring plowing.

    邱县农民互助发家
    添置农具准备春耕
    【本报邱县十二日电】经过组织起来互助生产，邱县农民已从贫困中解脱出来，家家过着饱暖生活，现正积极准备春耕。邱县一九四三年，遭受到五灾（敌、雹、蝗、旱、水）袭击，四四年发生蝗虫，四五年部分地区又遭到雹灾，农民生活比冀南其他任何地方痛苦得多。在政府积极帮助下，经过三年的生产救灾，广大农民组织运输、纺织和劳动互助，生活已全部改善。四六年行署把邱县做为领导生产的重点县，邱县领导机关亦集中大力领导生产，规模超过了以往任何一年。据不完全统计，全县互助和有一千零六十一组，共八千九百五十七人，占全县人口百分之十五强。全县二千五百五十七头牲口，参加互助的一千三百二十一头。一区三十五村，村村都有互助组，共有二百七十四组。二区西姚子头，在劳动英雄王连生领导下，土地产量增加，去年收成有十户够用二年，十六户够用一年半，四户够半年用。在生产运动中，大多数村庄都很重视副业，大部分互助组都结合着副业，做豆腐、磨粉、轧花、弹花、运输、淋盐、馒头坊、木匠铺、打牛绳等等，因此增加了收入，逐渐走向丰衣足食。南刘村因为解决寡妇焦王氏和光棍汉李同海的困难，鼓励了二十个光棍汉和寡妇参加互助。新各庄寡妇说：“人家都说没有男人不能过，我感觉没有互助组才不能过啦”。目前各村都开始修房、打墙、买牛、喂猪、准备农具。马头现有牛四十二头，计划今年再买二十头，农具也添置了很多。广大农民都喜气洋洋，忙着建立新家务，准备春耕。
