(Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu Office on the 7th) Wu Bijia, a landlord who fled from Wujiananchou Village, District Three, Taixi County, recognized the dark and hopeless nature of the Chiang-controlled areas and returned to the liberated area with the determination to participate in production. Wu Bijia was a former puppet village chief of Wujiananchou Village, District Three. He came from a landlord family and lived a wealthy and decadent life from childhood, never working. Last February, he was deceived by special agents and fled to Jinan. Because he had no means of support, and also hearing about the Eighth Route Army's lenient policies, he returned home. After he returned home, the villagers welcomed him and decided to leave him a waterwheel and a donkey, and return one mu and two fen of garden land so that he could make a living. He was very moved by the democratic government's leniency. At the mass meeting, he admitted his mistakes and told everyone about his prisoner-like life in Jinan and the Kuomintang's rumors and deceptions. He said very emotionally, "Everyone is too lenient with me. If I had known it would be like this, I would have returned home long ago. I will never believe the Central Army's deceptive nonsense in Jinan again. I will definitely engage in my own labor and production from now on."

    蒋管区贫富难活
    地主武必家回头
    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】泰西县三区武家南仇村逃亡地主武必家，认清蒋管区暗无天日，重回解放区决心参加生产。武必家是三区武家南仇的一个伪村长，他是一个地主家庭出身，从小过着富裕腐化生活，从不劳动。去年二月间听信特务的欺骗，逃到济南，因生活无着，又听到八路军的宽大政策，便回家了。他回家后，村里群众均表欢迎，决定给他留下水车和驴子，并退回园地一亩二分使他能过活。他对民主政府的宽大甚为感动，在群众大会上承认了错误，并把在济南的囚犯般生活和国民党的谣言欺骗告诉大家，他很感动的说：“大家对我太宽大了，要知道这个样子，我早就回家了，再不信济南中央军那些骗人的鬼话了。以后我一定自己劳动生产。”
