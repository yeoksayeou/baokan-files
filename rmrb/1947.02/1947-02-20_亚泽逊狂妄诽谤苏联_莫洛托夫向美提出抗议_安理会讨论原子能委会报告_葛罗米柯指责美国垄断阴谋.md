Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: TASS Moscow dispatch, February 16th: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presented a note of protest to the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 14th. It pointed out, "The Soviet government asks the U.S. government to take note of the intolerable behavior of U.S. Undersecretary of State Yazersen. Disregarding his government position, Yazersen personally made rude, slanderous, and discriminatory remarks against the Soviet Union in the Senate." The dispatch further stated: "On February 10th, when the U.S. Senate was discussing the appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Senator McKellar asked Yazersen whether he believed that if the Soviet Union possessed the atomic bomb, it would annex Europe and the rest of the world. In response to McKellar's rude anti-Soviet barking, Yazersen actually stated: 'Soviet foreign policy is both aggressive and expansionist.'" Note: Lilienthal is the director of the Tennessee Valley Authority. When the Senate discussed Truman's recommendation of Lilienthal on the 10th, some Republican senators, on the pretext that Lilienthal was a leftist, made opposing statements.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: Chenggong Lake News: The United Nations Security Council discussed the Atomic Energy Commission's report on the 14th. Soviet representative Gromyko spoke first, opposing the report, believing that this report, based on U.S. proposals, was a unilateral attempt to obtain atomic energy for one country, seeking direct monopoly, and believing that the main points of the report violated the UN Charter and the UN General Assembly's resolution of December 15th last year regarding universal disarmament, demanding the prohibition of the production and use of atomic weapons. He also criticized the U.S. for continuing to manufacture atomic weapons, intending to exert political pressure on other major powers. Gromyko called for the conclusion of a truly beneficial international convention for peace, which would contribute to the control of atomic energy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 16th: Reports from various sources: The Security Council passed a joint draft resolution on the procedural issues of universal disarmament and atomic energy control on the 13th. The main contents are as follows: (1) Formulate practical measures to give effect to the UN General Assembly's resolution of December 14th last year regarding universal disarmament. (2) Consider the report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission as soon as possible. (3) Establish a committee, to be named the Conventional Armaments Committee, composed of representatives of all member states of the Security Council. The committee shall submit to the Security Council recommendations on the following within a maximum period of three months: (A) Universal regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces. (B) The committee shall formulate practical and effective guarantees for disarmament to ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned resolution of the General Assembly. The above-mentioned recommendations are limited to the armaments within the jurisdiction of the new committee, and matters within the scope of the Atomic Energy Commission are not within its jurisdiction. (4) The committee should request the Military Staff Committee to submit recommendations to the Security Council on the establishment of a world police force as soon as possible, but no later than April 30th. It is reported that when voting separately on the various articles of the above-mentioned resolution, the Soviet representative approved the first and second articles, disagreed with the third article, and the attitude towards the fourth article is unknown.

　　亚泽逊狂妄诽谤苏联
    莫洛托夫向美提出抗议
    安理会讨论原子能委会报告
    葛罗米柯指责美国垄断阴谋
    【新华社延安十七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：苏联外长莫洛托夫十四日向美国驻苏大使提出抗议照会一件。其中指出“苏联政府请美国政府注意美副国务卿亚泽逊的不可容忍的行为。亚泽逊不顾自己的政府职位，竟亲在参院发表粗鲁的诽谤与歧视苏联的言论”。该电又称：二月十日当美国参院讨论任命李连素尔为美国原子能委员会主席时，参议员麦克勒询问亚氏，是否认为如果苏联握有原子弹时，会吞并欧洲及世界的其余部分？亚氏在答复麦氏此种粗鲁的反苏狂吠时，竟称：“苏联的外交政策既是侵略性的，又是扩张性的”。按：李连素尔为美田纳西州水利工程处处长，当参院十日讨论杜鲁门对李氏之推荐时，若干共和党参议员借口李氏为左翼人士，发表反对言论。
    【新华社延安十七日电】成功湖讯：联合国安理会，于十四日讨论原子能委员会的报告书。苏代表葛罗米柯首先发言，反对这一报告，认为这一基于美国建议的报告，是单方面的打算为一个国家获得原子能，企图直接垄断，并认为报告的主要点是违反联合国宪章与联大去年十二月十五日关于普遍裁军的决议，要求禁止原子武器之生产及使用。并抨击美国继续制造原子武器，是想对其他强国加以政治压力。葛氏呼吁缔结一真正有益于和平的国际公约，这将有助于原子能的管制。
    【新华社延安十六日电】各方报导：安理会于十三日通过普遍裁军与原子能管制程序问题的联合草案，主要内容如下：（一）拟定实际办法，使去年十二月十四日联大关于普遍裁军之决议发生效力。（二）尽速考虑原子能委员会所提之报告。（三）设立一委员会，定名为原有军备委员会，由安理会各会员国代表组成之，该委员须于最多不超过三个月之内，拟就下列建议，提交安理会。（甲）普遍管理及裁减军备与武装部队。（乙）由委员会拟定关于裁军之实际有效保障，以保证履行上述联大之决议。上列建议以新委员会所管辖范围内之军备为限，原子能委员会工作范围内之事宜，不在其裁处之列。（四）该委会应于军事参谋团尽速于四月三十日以前，向安理会提出设置世界警卫军之建议。据悉：在上述决议各条，分别投票时，苏代表赞成第一二条，不同意第三条，对第四条态度不悉。
