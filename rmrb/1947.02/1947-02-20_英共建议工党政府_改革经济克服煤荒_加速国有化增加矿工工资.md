　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. London dispatch: The British coal shortage has reached its eighth day on the 17th, and the climate is still below zero. Since the implementation of emergency measures, although coal reserves have hardly increased, the number of unemployed is still growing. Regarding the issue of overcoming the coal shortage, the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) issued a communique on the 16th, requesting the government to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire economic system of Britain, accelerate nationalization, increase miners' wages, and conclude trade agreements with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries in Europe.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Comprehensive London news: The Labour government is now making every effort to overcome the coal crisis. In addition to taking emergency measures to utilize electricity, the Attlee government ordered the cancellation of 147 passenger trains by the three major British railway companies from the 13th to transport coal and other major goods instead. The British Broadcasting Corporation also stopped broadcasting abroad on the 14th. In addition, 100 army trucks were mobilized and began driving into the coalfields on the 17th to transport coal directly from the pits to gas plants and power stations to supply the major towns of central England. In terms of manpower, officials from various departments of the Labour government have been mobilized to work for a certain period of time to overcome the coal shortage. According to one of the main reasons for the British coal shortage is the lack of manpower, and if the army is demobilized, this problem can be solved.

　　英共建议工党政府
    改革经济克服煤荒
    加速国有化增加矿工工资
    【新华社延安十八日电】伦敦讯：英国煤荒迄十七日已达第八日，气候仍在零度以下。自紧急措施实行以来，存煤虽难见增加，但失业人数仍在增长。关于克服煤荒问题，英共执委会于十六日发表公报，要求政府对英国整个经济制度，作一广泛的审查，加速国有化，增加矿工薪资，并缔结对苏及对欧其他民主国家的贸易协定。
    【新华社延安十七日电】综合伦敦消息：工党政府现正尽力克服煤炭危机，艾德礼政府除采取利用电力的紧急措施外，于十三日起令英国三大铁路公司，取消客车一百四十七次，以改运煤炭及其他主要物品。英国广播公司，亦于十四日停止向国外广播，另外并动员陆军卡车百辆，于十七日起开入煤田，从煤坑直接运煤至煤气厂与电力站，以供应英格兰中部之主要城镇。在人力上，工党政府各部官员多被动员，在一定时间内为克服煤荒而工作。按英煤荒主要原因之一为人工缺乏，如军队复员，则可解决此项问题。
