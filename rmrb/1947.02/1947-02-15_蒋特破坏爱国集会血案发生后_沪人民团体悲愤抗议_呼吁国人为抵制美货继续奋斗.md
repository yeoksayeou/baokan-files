Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 13th: According to various sources, on the morning of the 9th, Shanghai's department store employees held a meeting at the Labor Bank Building on Nanjing Road to promote the use of national goods, which was violently attacked by special agents. After this bloody incident, Chiang Kai-shek's police, without distinguishing right from wrong, arrested many of the attendees and those who were beaten. Wu Guozhen, the Chiang faction's mayor of Shanghai, hosted a press conference on the matter, falsely accusing the Shanghai industrial, commercial, and labor sectors of launching a "anti-American propaganda" campaign by "conspirators" to save the nation's survival, and said that the industrial, commercial, and labor sectors should bear "legal responsibility" for this case. According to a TASS dispatch on the 12th, citing a Wenhui Daily report, the Shanghai Student Union, Women's Federation, Democratic National Construction Association, and the Preparatory Committee for Promoting National Goods and Resisting American Goods have lodged serious protests against this, expressing grief and indignation at Wu Guozhen's remarks and the authorities' illegal measures. The committee and others called on all people to resist American goods, promote national goods, and continue to struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 13th: According to reports from the Tianjin Dagong and Yishi newspapers in Shanghai, the details of the Kuomintang special agents' sabotage of the patriotic rally in Shanghai on the 9th are as follows: The "Shanghai Preparatory Committee for Promoting National Goods and Resisting American Goods" was jointly initiated and formed by department store employees. On the morning of that day, the inaugural meeting was held at the venue of the branch of the Department Store Trade Union in the third district of the Labor Bank Building on Nanjing Road, with four to five hundred department store employees and manufacturer representatives attending. There were many special individuals dressed in short clothes mixed in the venue, and some of them gathered in front of the gate and on the road. When the meeting began, whistles sounded everywhere; a person holding a pistol seemed to give the order to "attack," and the ambushing thugs rushed out; for a time, tables and chairs flew, and the entire venue was in chaos. Those who escaped were also severely beaten by the ambushing thugs on the roadside. It is known that a total of twenty-five people were injured, including Liang Renda (formerly misreported as Liang Renyuan), whose head was smashed and died in the hospital. Guo Moruo and Deng Chumin, who attended the meeting, were escorted out by the desperate efforts of the employees. Ma Yinchu and Ma Lun were not injured because they had not yet arrived. On the same day, Shanghai cultural figures and people's organizations immediately held an emergency meeting and decided to first send Shen Junru, Tian Han, Ma Yinchu, and Hu Ziying as special envoys to visit the arrested and injured in the police station and hospital, and to draft protest measures. Guo Moruo called the incident a replica of the Jiaochangkou incident. Guo Moruo said: This atrocity is the greatest and best satire on the so-called "democratic constitution." Guo Moruo also wrote an angry poem: "Jiaochangkou on February 10th last year, the Labor Bank Building today, another ugly scene of peace and democracy! I sincerely express my condolences to the injured, you are glorious patriots, forever immortal! We must drive away American soldiers, American goods, and American imperialism, and also drive away the running dogs of American imperialism, otherwise there is no hope for China!"

    蒋特破坏爱国集会血案发生后
    沪人民团体悲愤抗议
    呼吁国人为抵制美货继续奋斗
    【新华社延安十三日电】据各方消息：九日上午沪市各百货业职工于南京路劳工银行大楼召开爱用国货大会，横遭特务凶殴。此一血案发生后，蒋介石警察当时不分皂白，反将与会和被殴群众多人一并逮捕。蒋方沪市长吴国桢为此事招待记者，妄诬上海工商业及劳工界为挽救民族生存而发起之爱用国货运动为“阴谋分子”的“反美宣传”，并谓工商劳工界对此案应负“法律责任”。据塔斯社十二日电引文汇报消息，上海学生联合会、妇女联谊会、民主建国会及爱用国货抵制美货筹委会已对此提出严重抗议，对吴国桢之谈话与当局不法措施表示悲愤，该委员会等呼吁全体人民抵制美货、提倡国货，继续奋斗。
    【新华社延安十三日电】据天津大公、益世两报上海专军报导，九日沪市国民党特务捣乱爱国集会大暴行经过如下：“沪市爱用国货抵制美货筹备委员会”系由百货业职工共同发起组成，该日晨假南京路劳工银行大楼三楼三区百货职业公会分会会址召开成立大会，到百货业职工及厂商代表四五百人，会场中混有身着短衣之特殊人物甚多，彼等并有一部＠集大门前及马路上。会议开始，口哨四起；一个持手枪若发令叫“打”，预伏之暴徒一拥而出；一时桌椅横飞，全场大乱，逃出者亦遭马路旁预伏之暴徒痛殴。暴徒并将群众从三楼拖至马路殴打，已知被殴伤者共二十五人，其中梁仁达（前误为粱仁远）头被击碎，当死于医院中。与会之郭沫若、邓初民，当由职工拚命保护出场，马寅初、马伦因尚未到会，均未受伤。当日沪文化界人士及人民团体立即召开紧急会议，决定先派沈钧儒、田汉、马寅初、胡子婴四人为慰问专使，分别往警局与医院慰问被捕与受伤者，并起草抗议办法。郭沫若称此事件为较场口之翻版。郭沫若氏称：这次暴行正是对所谓“民主宪法”最大最好的讽刺。郭氏并愤赋一诗：“去年二月十日较场口，今年今日劳工大楼，和平民主又出一次丑！我虔诚慰问受伤者，你们是光荣的爱国者，永垂不朽！我们一定要把美军、美货、美帝国主义赶走，还要赶走美帝国的走狗，不然中国没有救！”
