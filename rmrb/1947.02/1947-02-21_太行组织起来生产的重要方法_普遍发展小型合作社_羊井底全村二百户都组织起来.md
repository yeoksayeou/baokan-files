　　An Important Method for Organizing Production in the Taihang Region
    Universally Develop Small Cooperatives
    All 200 Households in Yangjingdi Village are Organized
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Zhu Muzhi reports: The small cooperatives currently being universally developed in the Taihang region have proven to be one of the most important methods for organizing small-scale peasant production. Their characteristics are that they organize all of the peasants' spare time into production, they are generally small in scale, and can be established with only three to five people. The capital is small, mainly relying on labor. Members can carry out various kinds of production according to their specialties. They are established during the agricultural slack season and stop during the busy agricultural season, which is extremely convenient for the peasants. The first to create this kind of cooperative was Yang Wangqiao, a liberated peasant in Yangjingdi Village, Pingshun County. In July of the year before last, Yang Wangqiao discussed with the mutual aid group members how to use the gaps after weeding the land to carry out other production. Some people in the group were originally flour mill workers and had milling tools, so everyone decided to open a small flour mill. Each contributed 150 catties of wheat as capital. A total of ten people milled for twenty days and made a lot of money. Then another six poor households were absorbed to participate. After the autumn harvest, there was more time, and in addition to milling flour, there was still a lot of surplus labor. Yang Wangqiao knew how to fluff wool, and the women in his family knew how to spin wool, so he immediately taught everyone how to fluff and spin wool. After that, seeing that it was more profitable to make wool into finished products, Yang Wangqiao and his brothers went out to learn how to knit sweaters, weave blankets, and make felt. After returning, they taught everyone. There were four retired soldiers and two cripples in the village, so they also found ways to make a living. During the summer busy season last year, everyone was willing to transport goods, so three people and two animals were immediately assigned to specialize in transportation. The women in the village originally knew how to spin cotton, but did not know how to weave cloth, so Wangqiao invited his aunt to teach everyone. After the autumn harvest, seeing that raising pigs was very profitable, two more flour mills were established, and fourteen pigs were raised. Under the influence of Wangqiao's cooperative, five more small cooperatives were established in the village. Including the village cooperative, there were a total of seven, divided into fluffing wool, spinning wool, knitting sweaters, weaving cloth, weaving towels, weaving felt, transportation, flour milling, and oil pressing. All 195 households in the village participated in cooperatives, achieving that no one was idle and no time was wasted. Last year, Yang Wangqiao's agricultural income was thirty dan, while his income from small cooperatives was sixty dan, achieving earning twice as much as cultivating; the village's agricultural income was three thousand dan, while the cooperative's income was more than three thousand two hundred dan, achieving earning more than half as much as cultivating. Now, Yang Wangqiao's small cooperative has been selected as a model small cooperative in the Taihang region.

　　太行组织起来生产的重要方法
    普遍发展小型合作社
    羊井底全村二百户都组织起来
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者朱穆之报导：太行区现正普遍发展的小型合作社，已证明为组织小农生产的极重要方法之一。其特点是组织了农民一切空闲转入生产，一般规模很小，三五人即可成立，资金不大，主要靠劳力。社员可按其特长进行各种生产，农闲成立，农忙即停止，对农民极为便利。首先创立这种合作社的是平顺县羊井底村的一个翻身农民杨王俏。前年七月间，杨王俏与互助组员讨论如何利用耨地后的空隙进行其他生产，组里有人原来是磨面工人，有磨面工具，于是大家决定开一小磨坊，各出一百五十斤麦子为资金，共十个人，磨了二十天，很赚钱，当又吸收六户贫苦户参加。秋后，时间更多，除磨面外，尚有许多剩余劳力，杨王俏会弹毛，家里妇女会纺毛，当即教大家学弹纺毛。此后，见羊毛制成成品获利更大，杨王俏与他兄弟即出外学打毛衣织毛毯及制毡，回来后转教大家，村里有四个荣退军人和二个拐子，因此也生财有道。去年夏忙时，大家愿意运输，当即抽出三个人二头牲口专门进行运输，村里妇女原会纺花，不会织布，王俏即请来他姑母教大家。秋后见养猪利大，又成立了二个粉坊养了十四口猪。在王俏合作社影响之下，村里又成立了五个小型合作社，连村合作社共七个，内分弹毛、纺毛、打毛衣、织布、织毛巾、织毡、运输、粉坊、油坊等业。全村一百九十五户，全部参加合作社。做到不闲一人，不闲一刻。去年杨王俏农业收入为三十石，而靠小型合作社之收入为六十石，达到耕一余二；全村农业收入为三千石，而合作社收入为三千二百余石，全村达到耕二余一。现在杨王俏小型合作社已被选为太行区小型合作社模范。
