　　Villages Found Not Thoroughly Overturned During General Inspection
    Southern Hebei Makes Efforts to Rectify
    [Report from this newspaper, Southern Hebei, 16th] During the land reform inspection movement in Southern Hebei, it was discovered that in all counties there were villages where the masses had not been thoroughly mobilized. Efforts are now being made to rectify this. In Yongzhi Fourth District, it was discovered that 13 villages in the district had not yet mobilized the masses, and in 50 villages the fruits of the struggle had not been distributed to the masses in a timely manner. The phenomenon of village cadres wasting the fruits of the struggle was also very serious. For example, in Kang Shengzhuang, 50,000 yuan was wasted. In Luan Village, village cadre Luan Changxiang embezzled 38,000 yuan of the proceeds. In Li Village, there was initially a fake struggle, with a total of 128 mu of land, three cattle, three carts, and three millstones "struggled" out, but the masses made an agreement with the "struggled against" households that whoever farmed the land would give half of the grain to the "struggled against" households. When the Central Army came, the land would be returned. There were also two feudal rich peasants who were missed, because one was the uncle of the Farmers' Association director, and the son of the other was studying in Jinan, and they were afraid that things would not go well when the Central Army arrived. In Li Village, two landlords were not struggled against, but they automatically took out 2,000 mu of land, and that was considered the end of the matter.
    The Wei County Party Committee, in its investigation of basic-level villages where the struggle had just ended, discovered that the struggle against the landlords was not thorough enough, and that many landlords were omitted. In Zhenghe Village alone, there were 12 such households. The reasons for the above phenomena were summarized as follows: First, the cadres were arrogant and complacent, and after the masses were mobilized, they did not seriously lead the masses in distributing the fruits. Second, the cadres did not follow the mass line sufficiently and did not fully mobilize the masses. Third, the cadres did not go deep enough, lacked investigation, and were deceived by the conspiracies and tricks of the landlords.

　　大检查中发现未翻透身村庄
    冀南努力进行填补
    【本报冀南十六日电】冀南土地改革检查运动中，发现各县均有群众尚未翻透身的村庄，现正努力进行填补。永智四区发现全区尚有十三个村群众未发动起来，五十个村果实没及时分到群众手里，村干浪费果实现象也很严重。如康盛庄浪费五万元，栾村村干栾常祥贪污果实款三万八千元，李庄先是假斗争，共斗出土地一百二十八亩、三个牛、三辆车、三盘磨，但群众却和被斗户订了公约，谁种地打了粮食给被斗户一半，中央军来了把地归还，还有两户封建富农也遗漏下，原因是一户是农会主任的叔叔，一户的儿子在济南读书，怕中央军来了不行。李庄两户地主未斗，自动拿出地二千亩，即算了事。
    威县县委在斗争刚结束的基点村调查，发现对地主斗争还不彻底，遗漏地主也不少，仅郑河一个村就有十二户。总结产生以上现象的原因：一是干部骄傲自满，群众发动后，没认真领导群众分配果实。二是干部走群众路线不够，没把群众充分发动起来。三是干部不深入，缺乏调查，被地主的阴谋花样所蒙蔽。
