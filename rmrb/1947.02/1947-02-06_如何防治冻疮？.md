    We are currently in the midst of frigid weather, and frostbite (chilblains) is most likely to occur. Let's talk about how to prevent and treat frostbite.

    Frostbite easily occurs in the extremities of the body, such as the ears, nose, fingers, and heels, because these areas mostly have fine blood vessels, and blood flow is slower. If they encounter highly cold stimulation, the blood will stagnate, the local area will be cut off from nutrition, lose body temperature and resistance, which will cause the skin to freeze, swell, and even crack or ulcerate. To avoid frostbite, pay attention to keeping the room warm and protecting vulnerable areas. If a certain part is frozen, do not try to warm it by fire, hot water, because sudden addition of external heat can easily cause the blood to stop flowing or even decay into sores. For general mild frostbite, you can use a damp cloth, ice cubes, snow or grated white radish to rub the injured area until it turns red and hot, then wrap it with cotton or cloth. If using medication, you can apply iodine, camphor ointment, or decoction of Yuanqing (traditional Chinese medicine) to wash the affected area, or mash a whole clove of garlic and apply it to the affected area, dry it in the sun, and then rub it again, or use honey and lard, steam it until cooked, and apply it to the affected area.

    如何防治冻疮？
    目前正处在严寒的天气里，最容发生冻伤（冻疮），我们就来谈谈如何防治冻伤的办法吧。
    冻伤容易发生在人体的末梢各部，如耳、鼻、手指、脚后跟等处，因为这些地方，大都分布的是微细血管，血液流动较慢，如遇高度寒冷刺激，血液即陷停滞，局部断绝营养，失去体温和抵抗力，就会使饥肤冻肿甚至迸裂或溃烂，要想不发生冻伤，要注意室内温暖，保暖易冻部分。如某部受冻，不要去烤火烧热开水烫，因骤然加外热，容易使该部血液停流甚至败坏成疮。一般轻冻伤，可用湿布或冰块雪块或烧白萝葡磨擦伤部，使它发红发烧时为止，然后用棉花、布包裹起来。如果用药，可在伤部涂上碘酒，樟脑膏、或元青（中药）熬水洗涤，或用独头大蒜捣烂，涂在患部，在日光中晒干后再磨擦，或用蜂蜜调猪油蒸熟，涂搽患部均可。（政权）
