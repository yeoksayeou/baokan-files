　　Different from the Past
    A Song of Liberation
    Changzhi City, First District Correspondence Group
    In the thorough "filling the gaps and making up the deficiencies" movement last winter, the masses' ideological awareness has been further enhanced. In the struggle, they elected truly beloved mass leaders to work for them. Below are two sections from the "Ten Differences" in the liberation songs of the Changzhi people.
    The landlord's house used to have,
    Four beams, eight pillars, and seventy-two rafters,
    With top and bottom gray brick and Western-style decorations,
    Its imposing manner and murderous aura rang loud.
    Who knew the poor lived in leaky shacks,
    With no lights at night and moonlight shining through.
    Now the world has turned upside down,
    And the poor live in brick houses.
　
    Before, if the street chief farted,
    Those below ran errands, unable to hold their breath,
    Wanting to report upwards,
    How could ordinary people dare to stand out?!
    Now, the new street chief is elected by the people,
    And mutual criticism is truly frequent,
    Whoever has mistakes accepts them,
    Big and small cadres are all the same.

　　与前大不同
    翻身歌谣
    长治市一区通讯小组
    在去冬深入彻底的填平补齐运动中，群众的思想觉悟更加提高了。在斗争中，选出了真正为他们所爱戴的群众领袖来替他们办事。下面是长治老百姓的翻身歌谣“十不同”中的两段。
    从前地主住的房，
    四梁八柱七十二根椽，
    顶底灰砖洋式装，
    威风杀气响丁当。
    谁知穷人住的破伞叉，
    黑夜没灯透月光。
    现在世界翻了天，
    穷人住上了砖瓦房。
　
    从前街长放个屁，
    下边跑腿沉不住气，
    有心向上把禀奏，
    小民那敢强出头？！
    现在民选新街长，
    相互批评真经常，
    谁有错误谁接受，
    大小干部都一样。
