    【Benbao Weixian 2nd dispatch】 The branch agency's front-line reporter group in Zhanghe reports: In Yanggangu Village, Eighth District, south of Zhanghe in Wei County, a militiaman was arrested by the Chiang army. The Chiang army asked Bai Yujin, a landlord who had been struggled against: "What does this person do?" Bai Yujin replied: "This person is indeed a good commoner." The Chiang army believed him and released the militiaman. Later, the Chiang army discovered that he was a militiaman trying to capture the landlord Bai Yujin, but Bai Yujin had already fled. According to people who escaped from the village, Bai Yujin saw through that the Chiang army, which plundered, raped, and pillaged indiscriminately regardless of rich or poor, could not last long, and that the Eighth Route Army and the masses were the future. A few landlords in the district did not run away when the Chiang army first arrived. As a result, their cattle, mules, and chickens were eaten by the Chiang army, and all their belongings were robbed. After the landlords of Huaying in the Eighth District were subjected to robbery and rape by the Chiang army, they complained to each other, saying: "The Central Army does not follow the rules, seizing women wherever they see them. What kind of bastard army is this?" The "Homecoming Corps" brought by the Chiang army ate and drank extravagantly in the village, demanding grain and cotton, and organizing landlords to establish reactionary organizations. The landlords secretly discussed, saying: "The Central Army is too bad; although the Eighth Route Army implements land reform, we have food and drink. The Central Army comes to rob, burn, and rape, making it unbearable. For the sake of living a good life, it is safer to follow the masses."

    看清蒋军必败
    地主决随群众
    【本报威县二日电】分社漳河前线记者团报导：魏县漳河以南八区杨甘固村，一个民兵被蒋军逮捕，蒋军问被斗地主白玉金：“这人是干什么的？”白玉金回答：“这人确是好老百姓”。蒋军信以为真，将该民兵释放，后蒋军又发觉是民兵要捕捉地主白玉金，白玉金早已逃走了。据该村逃来人说：白玉金看透了能军抢掠奸淫不分穷富不能长久，还是八路军和群众长远。该区少数地主在蒋军刚到时不跑，结果牛、骡、鸡被蒋军吃了，东西全被抢光。八区花营地主受到蒋军抢劫奸淫之后，互相诉冤说：“中央军不守规矩见女人就霸占，这算什么王八军队”。蒋军带来的“还乡团”到村大吃大喝，要粮要棉，组织地主成立反动团体，地主偷偷议论着说：“中央军太坏了；八路军虽实行土地改革，咱有吃又有喝，中央军来了抢烧、奸淫，闹的真没法过，咱为了好好过日子，还是跟群众保险。”
