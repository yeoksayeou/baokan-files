    On Carrying Out the Meritorious Service Movement Again
    Since the Su, Lu, and Wan troops first initiated the meritorious service movement last year, this movement has been widely carried out by troops and organizations throughout the liberated areas. Although it has become an effective tool and a great driving force for the People's Liberation Army to strive for victory, there have also been new developments in the content and methods of the movement.
    Why has the meritorious service movement of the People's Liberation Army been able to develop so vigorously? First of all, it is because of the just nature of the cause undertaken by the military and civilians in the liberated areas. Today, the self-defense war of the people in the liberated areas is not only to defend their own land and homes, but also to enable all Chinese people to enjoy the victorious achievements of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War and to free them from the aggression of American imperialism and the feudal fascist rule of Chiang Kai-shek. If Chiang Kai-shek wins this war, it will be a victory for American imperialism to colonize China and enslave the entire Chinese nation; and the victory of the self-defense war of the military and civilians in the liberated areas will determine the victory of the entire Chinese people against American imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's feudal dictatorship, and can determine the victory of our motherland's independence and freedom. Therefore, this self-defense war, in its nature, is a great national independence war after American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek replaced Japanese imperialism and Wang Jingwei. Its content is more profound and thorough than the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. It is a great Chinese national liberation war based on the unprecedentedly high awakening and unprecedentedly powerful strength of the Chinese people. All military and civilians in the liberated areas should more deeply understand the overall significance of today's war, realize the sacredness and importance of their responsibilities, and work harder to defend their land and strive for the independence and liberation of the entire nation, further promoting the new heroism and establishing more and greater merits.
    Today, all the efforts of the people in the liberated areas are for the victory of this patriotic self-defense war. For this, thousands upon thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are fighting for the people on the front lines and establishing merits for the motherland; in order to win the victory, we must still make the greatest efforts in military affairs. At the same time, we must also make the greatest efforts in implementing land reform and developing production. Recently, the meritorious service movement in various places has expanded from the front to the rear, from combat to logistics, from the main battlefield to the enemy-occupied areas and guerrilla areas, and from the troops to the organizations. This is very correct and should be done universally. And what is particularly important is that, in addition to continuing to popularize and strengthen the meritorious service movement in all departments of military struggle, it should also create a scale in military and civilian production and land reform according to the nature and needs of the work, and raise the past model worker movement to the highest stage in a way that is more in line with the current reality, so that the entire liberated area can achieve greater and sounder achievements in the three major central tasks of military, land reform, and production under the general slogan of everything for the victory of the self-defense war.
    Carrying out the meritorious service movement must also be combined with guarding against arrogance and impetuosity. The self-defense war of the past seven months has proved that Chiang Kai-shek, even with the help of American imperialism, is not terrible. What is terrible, however, is our own underestimation of the enemy and arrogance. It is undoubtedly certain that Chiang's army will be defeated and our army will win in this war. However, the US-Chiang forces still have considerable strength temporarily, and we ourselves still have many, even very serious, difficulties. We must not be arrogant! Although we are increasingly approaching victory, the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle has always been long-term, and we must not be impatient! Chairman Mao often taught us: we must be modest and prudent, and not be arrogant or impetuous. This is especially important today. The meritorious heroes of the liberated areas must always closely connect with the masses, humbly examine their own shortcomings, and play a leading role among the masses, so that they can strive for perfection and add merit upon merit. The military and civilians of the entire liberated area will be able to usher in the great victory of the patriotic self-defense war in the hot and vibrant meritorious service movement.

### 再论开展立功运动

    再论开展立功运动
    自去年苏鲁皖部队首创立功运动以后，全解放区部队机关已经普遍进行这一运动，虽然已经成为人民解放军争取胜利的有效工具和很大的推动力量，在运动的内容与进行的方式方法上，也有了新的发展。
    人民解放军的立功运动为什么能这样蓬勃开展呢？首先是因为解放区军民所进行的事业的正义性。今天解放区人民的自卫战争，不仅是为了保卫解放区人民自己的土地与家乡，而且也为了使全中国人民能够享受抗战八年的胜利成果，使其免于美帝国主义的侵略与蒋介石的封建法西斯统治。这一次的战争如果蒋介石得胜了，那就是美帝国主义殖民地化中国与奴役整个中华民族的胜利；而解放区军民自卫战的胜利，就决定了全中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略与蒋介石封建独裁的胜利，可以决定我们祖国独立自由的胜利。因此，这个自卫战争在其性质上，就是在美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石代替了日本帝国主义与汪精卫的地位之后的伟大的民族独立战争，其内容较之八年抗日战争更为深刻与彻底，它是以中国人民空前高度的觉醒与空前强大的力量为基础的伟大的中华民族解放战争。解放区全体军民应该更深刻地了解今天战争的这个全面的意义，体会到自己责任的神圣与重大，更加奋发努力，为着保卫自己的土地与争取全民族的独立解放，更高度的发扬新英雄主义，建立更多与更大的功劳。
    今天解放区人民的一切努力，就是为着争取这个爱国自卫战争的胜利。为了这，我们千千万万中华民族的优秀子女在前线为人民而战，为祖国建功；为了争取胜利，我们在军事上仍然要作最大的努力。同时，在贯彻土地改革与发展生产这些大工作上，也同样要作最大的努力，最近各地的立功运动，已经从前方扩展到后方，从作战扩展到后勤，从正面战场扩展到敌占区与游击区，从部队扩展到机关，这是很对的，应该普遍如此做的。而特别要紧的，就是立功运动除在军事斗争各部门应继续普及加强外，还应该在军民生产中间与土地改革中间按照工作的性质与需要创立起规模来，并把历来的劳模运动以更合乎当前实际的方式提高到最高的阶段，使全解放区在一切为着自卫战争胜利的总口号下，在军事、土地改革与生产这三大中心工作方面，都有更大和更健全的成就。
    开展立功运动，还必须与戒骄戒燥相结合。七个月来的自卫战争，证明了蒋介石加上了美帝国主义的帮助，是并没有什么可怕的。而可怕的，倒是我们自己的轻敌与骄傲。这个仗打下去，蒋军必败，我军必胜是确定无疑的了。但是，美蒋毕竟暂时还有相当的力量，我们自己也还有许多甚至很严重的困难，我们千万骄傲不得！尽管我们日益接近胜利，中国人民的反帝反封建斗争始终带着长期性，我们也千万急燥不得！毛主席经常教导我们：要谦虚谨慎，不骄不燥，这在今天尤其重要。解放区的立功英雄们要经常密切联系群众，虚心检讨自己的缺点，在群众中起带头作用，这样才能精益求精，功上加功。全解放区军民就能在热火朝天的立功运动中，迎接爱国自卫战争的伟大胜利。
