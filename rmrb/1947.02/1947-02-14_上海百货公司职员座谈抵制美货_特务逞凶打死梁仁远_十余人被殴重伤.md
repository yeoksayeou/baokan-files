    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. A violent act by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents against a patriotic gathering occurred in Shanghai. According to the Associated Press and Central News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: On the morning of the 9th, the Preparatory Committee for Boycotting American Goods, organized by employees of various department stores in Shanghai with the aim of saving Chinese industry and promoting the use of domestic goods, held a mass forum at the China Labor Bank Building on Nanjing Road. Democratic leaders such as Guo Moruo, Ma Yinchu, Deng Chumin, and Luo Longji attended the meeting. During the meeting, secret agents, assigned by the Kuomintang authorities and planted in the venue, suddenly started shouting and creating disturbances, and violently beat the attendees with wooden sticks and stones. Many people were injured on the spot, including twelve who were seriously injured. Liang Renyuan, an employee of Wing On Company, died of his injuries. The Huangpu Branch of the Shanghai Police Bureau only arrived to "suppress" the situation after the secret agents had completed their violent acts, and instead took all the beaten masses to the bureau for interrogation. They claimed that they would be sent to court to be "dealt with for disrupting order." Afterwards, the Kuomintang authorities, imitating the old trick of the Jiaochangkou incident, used the Central News Agency to describe the violence as a "mass brawl." Democratic figures from all walks of life in Shanghai have now lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities. Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Ma Yinchu, and Hu Ziying personally went to the police bureau to comfort the injured.

    上海百货公司职员座谈抵制美货
    特务逞凶打死梁仁远
    十余人被殴重伤
    【新华社延安十日电】上海发生蒋介石特务反对爱国集会暴行。据美联社中央社上海九日消息：九日上午，由沪市各百货公司职员组织旨在挽救中国工业，宣传服用国货的抵制美货筹备会，在南京路中国劳工银行大楼，召开群众座谈会。到会民主领袖郭沫若、马寅初、邓初民、罗隆基等。会议进行之中，国民党当局指派混入会场之特务，突起叫嚷捣乱，并用木棒、石块凶殴与会群众。当场即有群众多人受伤，其中重伤者即达十二人。内永安公司职员梁仁远，因伤重不治身死。沪警局黄浦分局，待特务暴行完毕，始赶来“弹压”，反将被殴群众悉数带局讯办。声称将解送法院，“以妨害秩序罪办理”。事后，国民党当局并效较场口故技，经由中央社将此次暴行描写为“群众互相殴斗”。沪各界民主人士，现已向国民党当局提出严重抗议。郭沫若、沈钧儒、马寅初、胡子婴诸氏并亲赴警局慰问受伤者。
