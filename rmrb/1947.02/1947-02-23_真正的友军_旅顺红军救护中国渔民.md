True Allied Forces
	Lüshun Red Army Rescues Chinese Fishermen
	On the morning of October 12th, fishermen from Yanchang Village, Longtang District, Lüshun, set out to sea for fishing. The weather was excellent when they departed, but a sudden violent storm arose at sea, with towering waves. None of the fishing boats returned, and the families ran around seeking help.

	Fortunately, a fisherman member of the village risked his life to rescue several fishing boats that were closer to the shore. However, many others had not yet returned. Chen Yonglu, the village chief of Yanchang Village, and Wang Lianru, a member of the people's dispute mediation committee, tirelessly walked to the Lüshun Municipal Government to report the incident.

	Upon receiving the news, the government immediately sent representatives to contact the Soviet Navy and dispatched warships for rescue. The Soviet naval commander readily agreed and immediately ordered warships to rush to the scene of the accident, more than twenty miles away at sea. The fishing boats were bobbing up and down in the raging waves; some boats were nearly full of water and about to sink; some boats were upside down, with fishermen clinging to the hulls in the water, shouting for help. Soviet sailors hurriedly threw ropes from the ships, but the fishermen's limbs were frozen numb and they were unable to climb; so the brave sailors did not hesitate to jump into the sea, holding the fishermen with one hand and the ropes with the other, racing through the roaring, surging waves. The storm was so strong that even the warships were constantly shaking in the fierce winds and waves. More than thirty sailors bravely vied with each other to rescue the fishermen, and after six hours of rescue efforts, they saved the lives of fourteen fishermen and seven fishing boats. The rescued fishermen were given sailors' clothes by the Soviet army, sent to the warm room on the ship to rest, and the medical staff gave each of the stranded Chinese a cup of alcohol. The revived fishermen's head and foot injuries were disinfected and bandaged. All the personnel on the ship took care of them warmly and prepared black bread (rye bread) and beef soup in the dining hall.

	The fishermen were grateful for the warm rescue and hospitality of the Soviet Red Army, and cheered "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" The warships returned to port at twelve o'clock at night.

	The next day, the surviving fishermen voluntarily sent two representatives, carrying fresh fish, white wine, and old hens, to the ship to thank them for saving their lives. The captain received them again, and great friendship filled the hearts of the two countries' military and civilians. (Excerpt from Dalian Daily)

　　真正的友军
    旅顺红军救护中国渔民
    旅顺龙塘区盐厂村一带渔民，十月十二日清晨出海捕渔，临行时天气甚佳，但出海后多时狂风暴作，波浪滔天，出海渔船全无归返；家属们，东跑西奔求救。
    幸有该村的一个渔民会员，身冒极险，把隔岸较近的渔船，救回若干。但仍有许多未归还者。盐厂村长陈永禄与人民纷争调解委员王连儒二人就不辞劳苦，徒步急行到旅顺市政府报告。
    政府得到消息后，马上派了代表去联系苏联海军。派舰驰赴援救。苏海军司令官慨然允诺，立即命令军舰急速驰赴二十余里外的海上出事地点。渔船正在惊涛骇浪中一起一伏；有的渔船中海水将满，要浸下去；有的渔船船底向上，渔人在水中扶着船沿呼喊求救。苏联水手急忙从舰上扔下绳子，但因船上渔民的身手被冻木，已无力攀登；于是英勇的水手们，毫不犹豫地跃入海中，一手举着渔民，一手拿着绳子骋驰于呼呼的汹涌涛浪中；风浪大得连军舰都不停地在狂风巨浪中动荡。三十余个水手却英勇地争先恐后地捞救渔人，经六个钟头的捞救，前后救护了十四个渔人的性命，七只渔船。被捞上的渔民都由苏军给换上了水手衣服，送入舰上暖室里休息着，医务员给遭难的中国人，每人都喝了一杯酒精，苏醒过来的渔人，头部和脚部的伤处也都消过毒用绷带包好，舰上全体人员都很亲热的看护着，在饭堂里给预备了黑列巴（按即面包）、牛肉汤。
    渔民们感激着苏联红军热诚的援救和招待；欢呼着中苏友好万岁！军舰返回港口时，已深夜十二点了。
    第二天，幸庆生还的渔民们，自动派两个代表，携带鲜鱼和白酒、老母鸡，到舰上去谢救命的恩情，舰长又接待了他们，伟大的友爱，充溢在两国军民之间。（节摘大连日报）
