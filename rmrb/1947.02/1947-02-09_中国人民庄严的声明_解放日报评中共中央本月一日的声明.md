Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 7th: *Liberation Daily* published an editorial titled "The Solemn Declaration of the Chinese People," commenting on the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's statement of February 1st, stating: "This statement is a declaration of the enlightened and firm will of the Chinese Communist Party representing all the Chinese people, and it is the solemn declaration of the Chinese people themselves. If the people of the world and the governments of all countries truly care about the fate of China and truly want to establish normal friendly relations with this great nation, which has five million square miles of land and a quarter of the world's population, they must first pay attention to this statement as the criterion for their future development of relations with China." The editorial pointed out: Since January 10th of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government has been continuously selling out all of our country's territorial sovereignty to American imperialism, establishing many humiliating and treasonous open and secret agreements and treaties. However, "The Chinese nation has always been a forthright nation that does not recognize bad debts. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have never recognized foreign aggression and domestic traitorous rule. Especially since the imperialist invasion of China a hundred years ago, the Chinese people have successively shed blood and sacrificed themselves, and their purpose is to 'abolish unequal treaties' and 'seek freedom and equality for China,' as stated in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's will." Since the founding of the Republic, the first big running dog of imperialism was the arch-traitor Yuan Shikai, who, after borrowing 25 million pounds in "rehabilitation" loans in 1913, launched a major civil war to eliminate dissidents, which was the "Jiangxi-Nanjing Campaign" of the second year of the Republic, under the name of "unification," and said, "Peace (sic) at home and abroad is the most important thing." In 1915, Japanese imperialism presented Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands, the benefit of which was to "please promote the President (sic)." Thus, Yuan Shikai signed the Twenty-One Demands and began preparing to ascend the throne, and the armies that rose up in resistance were "jointly planned for suppression, with no negligence"; and the Japanese pirates' navy sailed into China to patrol, and the army also entered many places to "maintain order." At that time, the Japanese aggressors and their running dog Yuan Shikai were indeed complacent and arrogant. However, the Chinese people's refusal to recognize and opposition to their traitorous autocracy defeated the conspiracy of Japanese imperialism and its running dog Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai's "promotion" and "restoration" collapsed after only eighty-three days, and the Twenty-One Demands were also thrown into the coffin with Yuan Shikai. Later, the Northern Warlords continued to betray the country and were swept away by the Great Revolution. During the Anti-Japanese War, Wang Jingwei, another big running dog of Japanese imperialism, also became "Chairman of the National Government" with the support of the Japanese pirates. After abolishing unequal treaties, he signed the Japan-Wang Treaty and many other traitorous agreements; in the end, the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang Jingwei, and canceled all unequal treaties between China and Japan. Now, American imperialism has replaced the position of Japanese imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek has replaced the position of Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei, and the Chinese people are even more awakened and more powerful. Learning from the past can know the future, so who can deny that the Chinese people's refusal to recognize all the traitorous agreements and traitorous acts of the Chiang Kai-shek government will ultimately be victorious?"

    The editorial also cited the history of American independence as an example: "When the British King ordered American immigrants not to move to the area west of the Allegheny Mountains in 1763, when London used various laws to restrict and cripple the industry and commerce of North America, when the British government ordered the American people to pay stamp duty in 1765, when British troops entered Boston in 1768, and according to the report of Massachusetts: 'British troops broke into people's homes, shot old men, stripped women naked and drove them into the streets, and committed all other possible shameless acts,' what was the American people's answer? The American people's answer at that time was: We will not pay any taxes that have not been approved by us or our representatives in person; it was to announce a boycott of British goods, to launch and insist on the War of Independence, and to issue the Declaration of Independence. They resolutely demanded the rejection of all the abuses of Britain in America, and solemnly declared that this demand was a true and indispensable manifestation of the freedom of the people, and that it was our unconditional right. The resolution of the American State Local Assembly Congress on November 9, 1765 is still there, and no one will doubt that the American people's answer at that time was the correct and legitimate answer, and that they were ultimately victorious. Today, the Chinese people, like the American people at that time, declare to the world that the non-recognition of the traitorous treaties, agreements, and various unilateral negotiations concluded by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government since January 10th of last year is a true and indispensable manifestation of the freedom of the Chinese people, and it is the unconditional right of the Chinese people. Anyone who despises or denies this right of the Chinese people, the ending can be seen in history! The failure of the old rulers of Britain, Japanese imperialism, Yuan Shikai, Wang Jingwei, etc., should have taught the people a lesson!"

    The editorial finally pointed out: "The Chinese people and their faithful representative, the Chinese Communist Party, have full determination and confidence in implementing their own declaration!"

    中国人民庄严的声明
    ——解放日报评中共中央本月一日的声明
    【新华社延安七日电】解放日报以“中国人民庄严的声明”为题发表社论、评论中国共产党中央委员会本月一日的声明称：“这一声明是中国共产党代表了全中国人民英明与坚强的意志的声明，是中国人民自己的庄严声明。全世界人民与各国政府如果真正关心中国的命运，真想与这拥有五百万平方英里土地、有全世界四分之一人口的泱泱大邦建立正常友谊的关系，就不能不首先注意这一声明，作为他们今后发展对华邦交的准绳”。社论指出：蒋介石的国民党政府从去年一月十日以后，不断的把我国的领土主权全部地出卖给美国帝国主义，成立了许多丧权辱国的公开与秘密的协定与条约。但是，“中华民族自古以来就是一个光明磊落的不认烂账的民族，几千年来中国人民对于异族侵略与国内的卖国统治就从来没有承认过，特别从百年前帝国主义侵入中国之后，中国人民前仆后继流血牺牲，其目的就是孙中山先生遗嘱中所说的“废除不平等条约”，“求中国之自由平等”。民国以来，帝国主义第一个大走狗就是窃国大盗袁世凯，他在一九一三年借到了“善后”借款二千五百万镑以后，就发动排除异己的大内战，这就是民国二年的“赣宁之役”，其名义也就是“统一”，并说“对内对外均以和平（？），此为最重要之事”。一九一五年，日本帝国主义向袁世凯提出二十一条，其好处是“请大总统高升），这样袁世凯便签订了二十一条，着手筹备登基，对起义反抗的军队则“一体合筹防剿，毋稍疏忽”；而日寇的海军就开进中国来巡逻，陆军也进入许多地方“维持秩序”。当时，日本侵略者及其走狗袁世凯确是自鸣得意，不可一世。但是中国人民的不认账和反对其卖国专制的运动，却打败了日本帝国主义及其走狗袁世凯的阴谋。袁世凯“高升”和“复辟”仅仅八十三天便倒下了，二十一条也跟着袁世凯一道被打入棺材里去了。其后北洋军阀继续卖国，也都给大革命扫光了。抗日时期，日本帝国主义另一个大走狗汪精卫，也由于日寇的支持当了“国民政府主席”，在废除不平等条约之后，签订了日汪条约以及其他许多卖国协定；结果呢，还是中国人民打败了日本帝国主义及其走狗汪精卫，取消了中日间的一切不平等条约。现在的情况是美国帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义的地位，蒋介石代替了袁世凯和汪精卫的地位，而中国人民却是更加觉悟和更加有力量了。鉴往可以知来，那么谁又能否认今天中国人民不承认蒋介石政府的一切卖国协定与卖国行为最后一定能胜利呢？”
    社论并举出美国独立的历史为例：“当一七六三年英王下令美国移民不准移向阿勒干尼山西地区的时候，当伦敦用了各种法令限制和摧残北美各地工商业的时候，当一七六五年英政府勒令美国人民缴纳印花税的时候，当一七六八年英军进驻波士顿，并且据马萨诸塞州的报告：“英军闯入了人家，把老汉枪杀了，把妇女剥光了身子赶到大街上，干出其他一切可能的无耻行为”的时候，美国人民的回答是什么？美国人当时的回答便是：凡非经我们亲自或我们的代表同意的任何税捐，我们都不缴纳；是宣布抵制英货，是发动和坚持独立战争，是发布独立宣言。他们坚决要求拒绝英国在美的一切虐政，并且庄严地宣告这个要求乃是人民自由之真实而不可缺少的表现，而且是我们无条件的权利。一七六五年十一月九日美各州地方议会代表大会决议案还在，谁都不会怀疑美国人民当时的回答是正确与合法的回答，而且他们最后是胜利了。中国人民今天要像当时美国人民一样，向全世界宣告不承认蒋介石卖国政府从去年一月十日以后成立的丧权辱国条约、协定与各项片面谈判，乃是中国人民自由之真实而不可缺少的表现，而且是中国人民无条件的权利。谁要轻视或否认中国人民的这个权利，其结局就可征诸历史！英国的旧统治者、日本帝国主义以及袁世凯、汪精卫等等的失败，总该给人民了一点教训！”
    社论最后指出：“中国人民及其忠实的代表中国共产党，对于实行自己的这一声明，具有充分的决心与信心！”
