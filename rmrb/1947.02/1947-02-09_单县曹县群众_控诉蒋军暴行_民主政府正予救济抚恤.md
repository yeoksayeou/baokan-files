    Masses in Shanxian and Caoxian
    Accuse Chiang's Troops of Atrocities
    Democratic Government Provides Relief and Compensation
    [This newspaper's front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 7th dispatch] On the 27th and 28th of last month, Hao, the head of the Shanxian Democratic County Government, and comrades working in Chengwu County went to Shanxian city to express their condolences to working comrades and civilians imprisoned in the county jail by Chiang's troops at the front lines. More than two hundred afflicted comrades and civilians were overjoyed to see the visiting comrades. Grasping their hands, they could only say "You've come," before breaking down in tears. Yu Qinghua, a woman's rescue association member from a certain village, spoke of the twelve-year-old children's corps leader, Gao Sifa, who was robbed and killed by Chiang's troops, and other civilians who suffered tragically at the hands of Chiang's troops, before collapsing on the ground and wailing loudly. Fourteen-year-old Tao Defa showed his arm, which had been beaten black and blue by Chiang's troops, and demanded that the democratic government avenge him. Zhang Jiande, a 54-year-old farmers' association chairman from Duan Village, said to the director of the district union: "They can break my bones, but they can't break my heart. The world will always belong to the common people." Xiao Guo, the son of the director of the Eighth District Union, wept with his father upon seeing him. Since Chiang's troops occupied Shanxian on September 2nd of last year, as many as 500 peaceful residents have been brutally murdered by Zhou Hecun, the Chiang's troops county head alone. All the farmers imprisoned in the jail knew that the devils would begin a new slaughter after their Sunday holiday. Even Liu Laohua, who guarded the prison gate, sighed with tears, saying, "The killing is too cruel!" On the 29th day of the twelfth lunar month, while the people were celebrating the New Year, Zhou Hecun was still shooting farmer Cai Xuewu outside the Dimen gate. Bai Shiyin was beaten to the point of death during his interrogation, and after his family carried him back and revived him, he was chased back and tortured to death. In prison, Feng Fuming received more than eighty blows and was beaten to death twice. During the New Year, the devils were drinking and playing finger-guessing games, while the imprisoned people were denied food and water for three days, and more than ten people died of thirst with bleeding from their nostrils and eyes. Five people were stripped of their clothes and frozen to death. Now, our democratic government has taken measures to allow the afflicted people to rest and recuperate, and to provide relief to their families.
    [This newspaper's front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 7th dispatch] After the Eighth Route Army recovered Caoxian, the masses have been reporting the atrocities of Chiang's troops to the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government. The owner of Chen's restaurant in Dongguan complained that Chiang's troops forced him to pay 600,000 legal tender, saying, "It's like the business is being done for them; the pots, bowls, basins, and ladles all belong to them." Most of the merchants in the city were extorted into closing their businesses. Chiang's troops brutally harmed the people, with more than 500 people being killed in the city alone. The twelve-year-old sisters' corps leader in the city was also brutally harmed. Our democratic government is urgently seeking to provide relief and compensation. The residents are now leveling the fortifications built by Chiang's troops, taking back their own beams and door panels, and restoring their lives with the assistance of the democratic county and district governments.
