——Answering Comrade Mei Chun's Questions

What does "Sima Zhao's heart is known to all" mean? – Sima Zhao was a person from the Wei Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period, the second son of Sima Yi. After his elder brother Sima Shi died, he inherited the position of Grand General, controlled the government, and very much wanted to become emperor, but he could not achieve this wish due to the opposition of other forces. Later, he supported his son Sima Yan to become emperor. At the time, everyone knew his intentions. Passed down to the present, the idiom "Sima Zhao's heart is known to all" is commonly used, meaning: although this matter has not been explicitly stated, everyone already knows it.

What is the free bourgeoisie? – This is spoken in contrast to the monopoly and comprador bourgeoisie. It refers to national capitalists above the general middle class who have no collusion or dealings with officials and foreign monopoly capital. They take the development of national industry and free competition as their aim, and oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the comprador monopoly of the four major families in China. In the current stage of China, they generally support independence, peace, and democracy.

Marine Corps – The Marine Corps is a group within the Navy that has received special training to be used as a landing force. Because the Navy cannot only fight at sea, sometimes it will encounter islands or coastal land. If a fleet attacks a certain island or coastal land, when approaching the island or land, the Marine Corps will land and fight the enemy. Its difference from the Army is that it can not only fight on land, but also at sea, so it is also known as an "amphibious force."

What does "Uncle Sam" mean? – "Uncle Sam" is a term for the United States. This term comes from the English (Uncle Sam). "Sam" is the transliteration of Sam, and "Uncle" is the Chinese meaning of Uncle. And the two English initials of Uncle Sam, U.S., are the abbreviation of "United States." Therefore, it has this name. At the same time, this term also has the intention of personifying the United States.

    小辞典
    ——答梅春同志问
    “司马昭之心，路人皆知”何意？——司马昭是三国时候的魏国人，司马懿的第二个儿子，他的哥哥司马师死后，承继为大将军，掌握国政，很想当皇帝，但因其他势力的反对，不能如愿，后来把他的儿子司马炎扶作皇帝，当时人都知道他的心思。传至现在，习用成语：“司马昭之心，路人皆知”，意思就是说：这事虽未明说，但已人人都晓得了。
    什么是自由资产阶级？——这是和垄断及买办资产阶级相对待说的，指一般中产阶级以上的民族资本家与官僚及外国独占资本并无勾结与往来者，他们以发展民族工业，自由竞争为职志，对美国帝国主义的侵略及国内四大家族的买办垄断，都是反对的。在现阶段的中国来说，他们一般是赞成独立和平民主的。
    海军陆战队——海军陆战队是海军中受过特别训练的一批作为登陆用的部队。因为海军不能光在海上作战，有时要遇到岛屿或沿海陆地。如一舰队进攻某一岛屿或沿海陆地，在接近该岛或陆地时，即由海军陆战队登陆与敌作战。其与陆军不同的就是它不仅能在陆上作战，也能在海上作战，故又有“两栖部队”之称。
    “山姆大叔”何义？——“山姆大叔”是对美国的一种称呼，这个名词是由英文（Uncle Sam）来的，“山姆”是Sam的译音，“大叔”是Uncle的中国意思，而Uncle Sam两个英文字字首Ｕ．Ｓ．是“美国”英文字United State的省写，故有是称。同时，这种称呼也有把美国人格化的用意。
