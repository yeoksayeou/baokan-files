Inside the Xi'an Labor Camp
Shang Xin

I spent two and a half years tasting the flavor of the labor camp. I always wanted to expose this human hell and let those who don't understand it know its true face. But because the pain was too deep, I wanted to cry whenever I mentioned it, and my mind was too乱 to write. My companions all said that my nerves were a little disordered and asked me not to mention sad things anymore, and even forbade me to write memoirs. I am very willing to accept their sympathetic advice; but today I am feeling a bit better, and I want to write out my blood and tears. Alas!

It is located outside the West Gate of Xi'an, north of the airport, occupying a clean piece of land of almost six or seventy hectares, and some houses built by German engineers many years ago that are not bad. It is surrounded by walls more than ten feet high, with dense barbed wire on top, and ditches that are both wide and deep outside the walls. The soldiers guarding the walls are called practice teams. Many bunkers are built against the walls, at irregular intervals of ten or eight feet. During the day, they carry guns like ordinary guards, facing the dormitories and classrooms inside the walls. At night, you can always hear the distant echoes of the guards.

Its organization's highest level is the director, followed by the director of education and the deputy director of education, and then various departments and teams. As far as I know, there is an education department, but I can't remember which department it was. The educational materials are the Three Principles of the People, Party History, Party Strategy, the Teachings of the Founding Father, the Words and Deeds of the Leader, critiques of Socialism, the errors of Communism, and some unimportant history, geography, mathematics, and Chinese language. The instructors are gathered from all walks of life, with students promoted from within the camp accounting for the majority. The Fourth Department is the Party Affairs Department, which uses anti-espionage methods to search for ideological offenders and loyal yes-men among the students in the camp; develops Party affairs, and captures people's hearts, so everyone likes to be summoned by the Fourth Department. Because someone is already working for you, you will soon have the qualifications of a party member. Having this qualification is a good omen. The Fifth Department is the Intelligence Department, the factory for manufacturing terror, the master switch for the source of new students, and the execution place for destroying lives. Its magic power extends internally to the students, trainees, practice teams, cleaning crews, and infirmaries of each team. Externally, it envelops the entire Northwest, with two prisons within prisons under its jurisdiction, beautifully named "Contemplation Rooms." The inner contemplation room is in the camp, and the outer contemplation room is unknown where it is outside the camp. Because those who go here must wear invisible glasses, and it must be at night. The source of criminals in the inner contemplation room is ideological offenders within the camp, and the outer contemplation room is considered even more serious. Both places have rare tortures such as "flying on a plane," "sitting on a telephone," "sitting on a tiger bench," and "applying bamboo sticks." They want to dig out the most wronged and painful complete answers from those they consider criminals. They will put you on glasses, tie you with ropes, and send you to the depths of Zhongnan Mountain in an unknown night. There is also a very large temple here. Then you can forget about seeing the sun!

The students of the labor camp come from different agencies, schools, and social departments. There are doctors who have studied at Cambridge and Harvard in Europe and the United States, and poor scholars who can't read a peck of characters. There are generals-level staff officers, section chiefs, senior instructors, innocent people who don't know why they came, Taoist priests over seventy years old, children under ten years old, girls in their bloom, old women, carpenters, barbers, and blacksmiths. All kinds of people are there, and it is not difficult to imagine why they came.

After arriving, the first step is to report to the new student team for training. The new student team is a special training rarely seen in the world. Under the "work performance" doctrine, the date you leave the new student team is determined. If it is considered that your performance is too poor, then you are not qualified to be assigned to a team. Continue to be a new student. The so-called "work" is digging new wells to fill old wells, making adobe bricks, smashing them and then making them again, burying bricks, digging up bricks, grinding bricks, and grinding brick dust. The so-called "performance" is to review your joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, words, and actions. Here, laughter is hypocrisy, anger is dissatisfaction with the status quo, sorrow is something to be noted, and happiness is bound to be purposeful. Saying too much means you have social skills, luring the masses, and having ulterior motives. Silence means you are doing things in your stomach, which is even more dangerous. Anyway, you can't cry or laugh. Young people who have not been in the world for long, this stage of stimulation will make you have disordered nerves, seeing enemies everywhere, suspicious and frightened, and commit suicide. Suicide is not news here. Many people lose their lives under knives and cleavers, and many also die from hunger strikes or drowning in wells. What is more nerve-wracking is to be disappeared. Disappearance is the judgment before the trial, the execution before the judgment. People are afraid when they hear it.

The most inhumane thing is to dig manure pits. Use the bowl you eat from to dig up the feces from the manure pit, and use the bucket for serving rice to carry it to the large manure pit on the farm. Wash it and use it again when you eat. This is the family style of the ninth team of the labor camp. Under the "performance" doctrine, who dares to say that hunger and uncleanliness are wrong? After the lights are turned off at night, you have to shout "Report" loudly to leave the dormitory. If someone outside answers something, you have to explain clearly that you want to defecate or urinate. If his answer is "come out," then you are lucky to meet a good person. You keep shouting "Report, Report" all the way to the toilet, and it is still the same when you come back. If his answer is unclear or there is no answer at all, and you think that someone has already allowed or acquiesced and you come out, then you are qualified to go to the Contemplation Room. As for who the sentries are? It is not worth mentioning here.

In summary, terror creates extreme anxiety in people's hearts, causing suspicion and fear among classmates, and creating extremely morally degenerate framing and fraud. The number of deaths here is extremely alarming, and more than 90 percent of the families of the dead rarely know their whereabouts.

News reporters from European and American visiting delegations visited the camp two years before the victory (referring to the Chinese and foreign reporters who went to Yan'an in 1943 - editor) and held a terrible tea party. The answers to the questions were rehearsed in advance. A funny reporter from a certain country used the excuse of losing a fountain pen and quietly returned after walking for half an hour. He saw the gatekeeper he had not seen the first time and shook his head and sighed, saying: "The young people here are the most pressure-resistant people. I wish you a bright future!"

Oh my god! Where is the light? I am a sufferer of two years of university, two years and six months of labor camp, and two hundred days in Zhongnan Mountain. Now, now I am in the army....

    西安劳动营的内幕
    商新
    我曾在劳动营尝过滋味二年半，每想把这人间魔窟拆穿，使不明了的人知道他的真面目；但是因为由于痛苦太深，提到这件事就想哭，而且心乱得写不下去。同伴们都说我神经有些错乱，不要我再提伤心事，更不允许我写回忆的文章。我很愿意接受他们同情的劝告；但今天精神比较爽快些，我要把我的血泪写出来了。唉！
    它在西安西关外飞机场北边，占着一片差不多六七十顷的干净地皮，和一些若干年前德国工程师建筑的很不算坏的房子。周围有高约一丈多的围墙，墙头上罩着密密的铁蒺藜网，和围墙相辅而行的外面有既宽且深的沟。守围墙的兵叫练习队。依围墙筑起不少的碉堡，十丈八丈的距离不等。白天他们和普通的警卫兵一样，扛着枪，面对墙里的各处寝室、课堂。晚上你可随时听到遥相呼应的警备。
    他的组织最高级是主任、其次是教育长副教育长，再下设各科各队，据我所知道的有一个教务科，至于他是第几科，记不清楚了。教育的材料是党义、党史、党略、国父遗教、领袖言行、社会主义的批判、共产主义的错误和一些不关紧要的历史、地理、数学、国文。教官是由各式各样凑来的，本营学生提升的占大半。第四科为党务科，在本营的学生中以反间谍的方式搜索思想犯和忠实的应声虫；发展党务，补捉人心，所以人人都喜欢四科传讯。因为已经有人替你效劳，不久便有团员的资格。有了这个资格，便是吉兆。五科是情报科，是恐怖的制造厂，是新生来源的总电钮，是毁灭人生的执行处。他的魔力内而至于各队的学生、学兵、练习队、清洁班、医务所。外而笼罩着整个的大西北，辖有监牢中的监牢两个，美名之曰“思过室”，内思过室在营内，外思过室不知在营外何处。因为要到这里的人必须戴上看不见的眼镜，并且是晚上。内思过室犯罪者的来源是营内的思想犯，外思过室是更认为严重的。两处都有人间罕有的坐飞机、坐电话、坐老虎凳子、惯竹签等酷刑。他要挖出他认为犯罪者的最冤枉最痛心的完全答复，把你在一个不知不觉的晚上，戴上眼镜，绳捆索绑；送到终南山深处，这里还有一个极大的寺院。那你就休想见天了！
    劳动营的学生，来自不同的各机关、学校、社会各部门。有留学欧美剑桥哈佛的博士，有斗大的字识不到一升的穷措大。有将官之类的参谋、处长、高级教官、有不知何所为而来的良善百姓、有年逾七十的老道士、有不满十岁的儿童、有年方二八的姑娘，有老太婆、有木匠、理发匠、铁匠。形形色色无所不有，至于为何而来，不难想知。
    既来之后，第一步便是新生队报导受训，新生队是人间少有的特别训练。在“工作表现”的教条之下，确定你脱离新生队的日期。如果认为你表现太差，那你就没有编队的资格。继续的作新生。所谓“工作”是挖新井填旧井，打土坯锤碎再打，埋砖头、扒砖头、磨砖头、磨砖灰。所谓“表现”是审查你的喜、怒、哀、乐、言谈、举动。这里的笑是虚伪，怒是不满现状，哀是须得注意，乐是必有所为。言多说你交际手腕，笼络群众，别有企图。沉默说你肚里作事，危险更大。反正哭笑不得。入世不久的青年，这一阶段的刺激，会使你神经错乱，草木皆兵，疑虑悸怖而自杀。这里自杀不是一件新闻，在小刀、菜刀之下断送生命的很多，绝食或投井而死的亦复不少。比较刺激神经的要算失踪。失踪是审判之前的判决，判决之前的执刑，人们听到没有不怕的。
    最不人道的是挖粪坑，用你吃饭的碗挖起粪坑的大便，用盛饭的桶，端到农场的大粪坑，吃饭的时候洗洗再用它。这是劳动营第九队的家风。“表现”教条之下，饥饿和不洁有谁敢说不对呢？晚上熄灯之后，出寝室得大声喊报告，外边如有人答应什么事？你便将你要解大便或解小便说明白，如果他的回答是出来，那你是该幸运碰见好人，一路到厕所的路上，报告报告喊个不停，回来仍是如此。如果他的回答不清楚或根本没有回答，而你认为人家已经允许或默许，便走了出来，那你就有到思过室的资格了。至于站岗的是些什么人？这里不值一提。
    总括的说，恐怖造成人心极大的不安，使同学间猜忌、疑惧，造成道德极端堕落的陷害欺诈。人数死亡在这里极端惊人，死者家属百分之九十以上很难知道他的下落。
    欧美访华团新闻记者在胜利前两年（按指一九四三年到延安去的中外记者团——编者）曾莅营参观，开了一个可怕的茶话会，问题的解答是预先背会而演习过，滑稽的某国记者以丢水笔为借口，走了半小时后，悄悄又回来。他看见第一次来所不曾看见的门卫，摇头叹息的说：“这里边的青年是人类耐压力最强的，敬祝你们前途光明！”
    天哪！光明在那里？我是大学两年、劳动营二年六个月，终南山二百天的苦难者，现在，现在充了军……。
