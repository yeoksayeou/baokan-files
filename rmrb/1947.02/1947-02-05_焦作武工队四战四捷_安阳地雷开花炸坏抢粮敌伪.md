[Report from Jiaozuo] The Jiaozuo militia and guerrillas have penetrated deep behind enemy lines to launch a revenge movement. The militia of the Third District crossed the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai highway and captured Li Xindou, an upper-class soldier of the 58th Regiment, and another enemy soldier in Jiahetun. They were commended by the city headquarters. On the 17th, we achieved four victories in four battles: The × Workers' Team repelled more than 70 enemy troops seizing grain in Si Hou Village; Yang Juhe's Armed Work Team of seven men and seven guns defeated more than 30 enemy troops harassing the area in Hongshaling, seizing a portion of the spoils; Ren Xiuhe's Armed Work Team and the militia of the First District ambushed the enemy in Qu Village and captured one enemy soldier; the Public Security Bureau also defeated more than 100 enemy troops seizing grain in Shuangbochi.

[Report from Anyang] On the morning of January 17, more than 60 members of the enemy's "Homecoming Corps" in Shuiye went to Xigang Village to loot cotton. The militia of nearby villages rushed to the rescue and defeated them in one fell swoop. The militia pursued them, and when the enemy fled to Xiang Village, attempting to resist with fortifications, they stepped on three landmines we had pre-buried there, killing the enemy machine gun deputy captain Li Fengqi and several soldiers. Furthermore, on January 16, an enemy × company commander led several soldiers to seize Xiaolang Mountain. The company commander stepped on a landmine pre-buried by our Shuiye Explosives Team and was seriously injured, and the enemy fled in panic.

[Further Report] On January 17, our Anyang Nanling Headquarters convened a meeting of model cadres and militiamen from various districts and the Public Security Team to exchange combat experiences and compete in killing the enemy. At the meeting, 46 model cadres and militiamen who had killed the enemy emerged, divided into three classes, all of whom received glorious awards. In summarizing combat experience, it was unanimously agreed that in the future, they should go deep behind enemy lines and launch an explosive movement. Li Xuekai's Armed Work Team, a model for killing the enemy, launched 76 attacks last autumn, burned 45 bunkers, captured 12 landlords who had collaborated with the enemy, and killed or wounded 19 enemy soldiers. Comrade Zhang You was resourceful and brave. He once crossed the Huan River secretly, burned bunkers during the day, and repelled the enemy with hand grenades in Yongding Village. Li Bang, a sharpshooter, once repelled the attack of the enemy's 40th Division with a cold shot. He killed two enemies with a cold shot in Doumazhuang, killed two enemies across the river in Xifangshan with one shot, and frightened the enemy back in Nanshanying by blowing a bugle and shooting cold shots.
