Landlords and Rich Peasants Manipulate the Government, Suffering Masses Still Not Liberated
Guantao County District Cadres Are Organizing the Village to Struggle
[Our newspaper’s dispatch from Weixian, 29th] After the rent reduction and interest rate reduction in Guantao, the land reform has been basically completed in the whole county, but the masses in Jiaocun Village have not been liberated. The main reasons are: (1) The village government is still controlled by landlords and rich peasants. The village head (a rich peasant) threatened the masses, saying, "Whoever wants to demolish the landlord's house, however it is demolished, you will have to rebuild it for them in the same way from afar." He runs errands to Tianjin for the district, doing business, and deceives individual cadres in the district. (2) The fruits of past struggles have not been distributed, and the masses are very dissatisfied with the village cadres. (3) Several soldiers who deserted and returned home were incited by the village head to obstruct the masses from turning over. After discovering this problem, the county leadership immediately sent responsible comrades to assist the district cadres in helping the masses in the village to turn over.

　　地主富农操纵政权焦圈群众仍未翻身
    馆陶县区干部正组织该村斗争
    【本报威县二十九日电】馆陶经过查减，全县基本上完成土地改革，但焦圈村群众始终没翻了身，主要原因：（一）村政权仍操纵在地主富农手里，村长（富农成份）威胁群众说：“你们谁想拆地主的房子，怎样拆的，远得怎样给人家盖。”他给区里跑天津做买卖，欺骗区里的个别干部。（二）过去斗争的果实还没有分，群众对村干非常不满。（三）几个开小差回家的战士，村长挑拨他们阻拦群众翻身。县领导机关发现这个问题后，即派负责同志协同区干帮助该村群众翻身。
