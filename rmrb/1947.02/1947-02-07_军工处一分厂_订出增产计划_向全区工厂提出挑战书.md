Military Industry Department No. 1 Factory
    Formulates Production Increase Plan
    Issues Challenge to Factories Throughout the Region
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The entire staff of Military Industry Department No. 1 Factory, based on individual plans collected and consolidated, has formulated a factory-wide plan and issued the following challenge to all factories and mines in the entire border region:

    First, it is necessary to keep abreast of production conditions at all times, and to inspect and promote the production of each group, increase quantity and quality, and fully support the front lines. During the competition period, each person will increase two voluntary workdays per month, guarantee the completion of the production tasks assigned by the higher authorities, implement a ten-hour work system, ensure that the scrap rate does not exceed 15 percent, the explosion rate of shells is 100 percent, and materials are conserved to the greatest extent possible on the premise of not affecting the quantity and quality of production within the limits prescribed by the higher authorities. Absolutely implement work systems, labor discipline, instructions and notices from higher authorities, and assigned tasks.

    Second, closely link the Party, government, and labor union into a three-in-one entity to achieve mutual respect, mutual consultation, and more consistent steps. Among employees, between teachers and apprentices, maintain close unity, further promote the traditional style of respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and guarantee that there will be no tendency to quarrel or fight. Between brother factories, absolutely avoid departmentalism. The transfer of personnel, machinery, and tools must absolutely comply with the instructions of higher authorities, acting strictly towards oneself and generously towards others.

    Third, under the principle of considering both public and private interests and rewarding labor according to work (piece-rate wages), help employees establish revolutionary households, appropriately improve the lives of employees, organize household production by employees, mobilize employee savings, establish employee cooperatives, and promote the work style of thrift and hard struggle.

    Fourth, promote democratic work styles, inspire employee initiative and creativity, adopt correct employee opinions, strengthen technical research work, reward inventions, and cultivate apprentices, ensuring that they can do specialized work independently within four months.

    Fifth, grasp the thoughts of employees, solve problems in a timely manner, carry out ideological struggle, and overcome unhealthy tendencies. Organize current events studies, strengthen political, cultural, current events, and technical learning, and eliminate illiteracy; those who already recognize fifty characters should be raised to two hundred characters, those who recognize two hundred characters should be raised to five hundred to one thousand characters, and those who recognize more than five hundred characters should be raised to the point where they can read simple documents; those who cannot do arithmetic should learn general addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and learn to read and use commonly used rulers; carry out sanitation and entertainment work to liven up political life.

    Sixth, strengthen the unity of the military, government, and people, respect governments at all levels, enforce government decrees, protect the interests of the masses, and help the masses to emancipate themselves.

    Seventh, competition period: From January 1, 1947, to May 1, of this year, for a total period of four months.
