In Lucheng, Nearly a Thousand Evil Landlords Overthrown, Absolute Poverty Eliminated, County Secretary Chen Zhenhua Calls for Overcoming Complacency and Conducting Systematic Ideological Education for Backward Elements. Three Experiences in Carrying Out the Movement: Class Demarcation, Complaint of Suffering, and Releasing Burdens.

[Report from this newspaper in Lucheng] Since the expansion cadre meeting on November 29th put forward the policy of thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants and completing land reform, Lucheng County, both in plains and mountainous areas, in villages large and small, has vigorously launched a check-up and emancipation movement. In the two months of the movement, the whole county has generally achieved "land to the tiller," absolute poverty has been completely eliminated, and the peasants have achieved significant victories. According to statistics from 108 villages, nearly a thousand evil landlords have been overthrown, and the peasants have recovered 34,995 mu of land, 6,930 houses, and 20,000 shi of grain. The peasants have greatly risen in status. In 85 villages, the original 359 households of absolute poverty have all risen to the level of middle peasants. 2,553 households of poor peasants have risen to the level of middle peasants, and 341 households of farm laborers have risen to the level of middle peasants. After this movement, the peasant ranks have been further consolidated, and various organizations have been expanded. In 108 villages, the original 1,529 members of the industrial union have increased to 1,716; the original 11,197 members of the peasant association have increased to 15,878; the original 9,486 members of the women's association have increased to 11,258; the original 2,219 militiamen have increased to 2,670; the original 2,136 activists have been joined by 1,541 newly emerged activists. Now, some villages have turned to the in-depth stage, facing backward elements and conducting systematic ideological education. In this movement, three experiences have been gained: First, class demarcation. Only by allowing peasants to discuss and clarify class boundaries can we truly unite the peasants and recognize the relationship between landlords and peasants. At the beginning of this movement, class demarcation was universally carried out in all villages. After class demarcation in Xiliu, the two fighting camps of landlords and peasants were clearly distinguished, the middle and rich peasants' fear of struggle was resolved, and the peasants' ideological concerns were resolved. Everyone said, "Today, we peasants have become a family, and we will resolutely fight against the landlords. Whoever preserves things for the landlords is harboring class enemies." As a result, 40 households took out things they had preserved for the landlords and turned to struggle. Second, complaining of suffering. Some people think that "words repeated three times become bland as water" and are not very effective, but this experience proves that the more one complains of suffering, the more suffering there is, and the more bitter it becomes. From the comparison between the old and new societies, it is directly linked to today's self-defense war. Under the leadership of Liang Madou, a hero of emancipation, Licungou carried out a root-tracing complaint, connecting their entire lives from small to large, realizing that in the old society, peasants suffered for a lifetime. Today, after being emancipated, they are engaged in a self-defense war precisely to defend the fruits of the peasants' emancipation. Therefore, it is still a struggle between peasants and landlords. An old man in Machang hated the landlord so much during his complaint that he bit the landlord's ear but failed to bite it off, only realizing that he had no teeth. When talking about emancipation, he smiled and thanked Chairman Mao. Third, releasing burdens. In addition to using beauty traps to buy off and exploit cadres to confuse people ideologically, the most clever way for landlords to resist the peasants' struggle is to "kill two birds with one stone" by entrusting things to the peasants' homes. On the one hand, they preserved their things; on the other hand, the peasants' minds were burdened, and they dared not actively struggle, weakening the peasants' will to fight. After mass discussion, it was recognized that this was a landlord's conspiracy. After calling on the masses, ideological concerns were resolved, greatly increasing the peasants' combativeness, and the struggle turned to a climax. At the county cadre meeting on January 26th, Comrade Chen Zhenhua, Secretary of the County Party Committee, pointed out that although we have achieved great victories, we must not be complacent. In the future, we should focus on the check-up and emancipation movement, combine it with production, face backward elements, conduct systematic ideological education, repeatedly check, and mobilize all peasants from the ideological point of view. We must comprehensively and thoroughly complete the land reform before the spring plowing. (Lucheng United Office)

    开展运动三点经验：划阶级  诉痛苦  放包袱
    【本报潞城讯】潞城从十一月二十九日扩干会提出彻底消灭封建尾巴，完成土地改革的方针后，全县平川山地，大小村庄都轰轰烈烈的开展了检查翻身运动。在两个月的运动中，全县已普遍的达到了耕者有其田，赤贫已全部消灭，农民取得显著胜利，根据一百零八个村统计，近千户恶霸地主被斗垮，农民收回土地三万四千九百九十五亩，房屋六千九百三十间，粮食二万石。农民大大上升，八十五村原有赤贫三百五十九户，已全部上升为中农，贫农上升中农的有二千五百五十三户，雇农上升中农三百四十一户，经过这次运动，农民阵营进一步巩固，扩大了各种组织，一百零八个村原有工会员一千五百廿九名，现有一千七百十六名，原有农会员一万一千一百九十七名，现在有一万五千八百七十八名；妇会员原有九千四百八十六名，现有一万一千二百五十八名；民兵原有二千二百十九名，现有二千六百七十名，积极分子原有二千一百三十六名，这次新涌现出一千五百四十一名。现在已有些村庄转向深入阶段，面向落后层，进行系统的思想教育。在这一运动中，取得三点经验：一、划阶级。只有让农民讨论划清阶级界线，才能够真正团结农民，认清地主和农民的关系，这次运动开始，各村普遍的划分阶级。西流经过划阶级，分清了地主和农民两个斗争阵营，解决了中富农怕斗争思想，解决了农民思想顾虑，大家说，今天咱农民成了一家人，坚决向地主斗争，谁给地主保存东西，谁就是包庇了阶级敌人，当有四十户拿出给地主保存的东西，转向斗争。二、诉苦。有些人认为话说三遍淡如水，不顶啥，但这次经验证明，苦是越诉越多，越诉越苦，从新旧两个社会的对比，一直连系到今天的自卫战争，李村沟在翻身英雄梁马豆领导下进行追根诉苦，从小到大一生连系起来诉，认识到过去农民在旧社会里是一辈子的苦，今天翻了身又进行自卫战争，正是为了保卫农民翻身果实，所以仍是农民和地主的斗争，马厂一个老汉在诉苦中恨的咬地主的耳朵，没咬下来，才知道自己是没有牙了，说到翻身时，便面带笑容，感谢毛主席。三、放包袱。地主抵抗农民斗争，除用美人计收买利用干部在思想上迷惑外，最巧妙的办法，是一箭射双雕，给农民家里寄存东西，一面保存了他的东西，另方面农民思想上背了包袱，不敢起来积极斗争，消弱了农民的斗争意志，经过群众讨论，认识了这是地主的阴谋，经过号召解决了思想上的顾虑，大大增加农民的斗争性，斗争转向高潮。一月二十六日全县干部会上，县委书记陈振华同志，提出我们虽然获得巨大胜利，但不能自满，今后应以检查翻身运动为主，结合生产，面向落后层，进行系统的思想教育，反复的检查，把所有农民最后的从思想上发动起来，一定在春耕以前全面彻底的完成土地改革。（潞城联合办公室）
