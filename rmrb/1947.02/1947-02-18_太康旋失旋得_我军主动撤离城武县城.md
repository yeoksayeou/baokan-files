(From our front lines in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 16th dispatch) The county town of Taikang in eastern Henan was briefly occupied on the 9th (previously mistakenly reported as the 11th) by the Kuomintang police force and the Taikang Security Regiment, but was recaptured by the Eighth Route Army that same evening. The Chiang army's occupation of the city lasted only six hours. Furthermore, on the 14th, the Eighth Route Army voluntarily withdrew southwest to Chengwu County town.
