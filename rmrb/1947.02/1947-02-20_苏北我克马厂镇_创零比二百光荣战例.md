Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: The New Fourth Army's children's regiment, which has persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Yancheng and Funing areas of northern Jiangsu, captured Machang Town on the Huaiyin-Lianshui highway on the night of the 10th. Of the more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek's district office personnel, district troops, and "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in the town, more than ten were killed or wounded, and the remaining 190-plus were captured alive. The children's regiment suffered no casualties, creating a glorious example of zero casualties versus two hundred enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: According to incomplete statistics from January 25th to February 9th, New Fourth Army local troops and militia guerrillas in various parts of central Jiangsu, in their anti-"mopping up" and anti-raiding operations and multiple proactive attacks, killed, wounded, and captured hundreds of Chiang Kai-shek's troops below the battalion commander level, as well as "Homecoming Corps" members, and recovered Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds such as Zhengjiazhuang in the northwest of Dongtai and Xiaoyankou and Zhunjia Garden in the northeast of Rugao. On the 29th of last month, a certain unit of the New Fourth Army ambushed the remnants of the 79th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 49th Division. After two hours of fierce fighting, two platoons of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were completely wiped out, and another company and platoon were routed, capturing a total of 57 Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers below the platoon leader level, and killing or wounding more than 50. On the 4th of this month, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek's troops and "Homecoming Corps" members, in coordination with Chiang Kai-shek's Second Gunboat Detachment's No. 50 gunboat and three ironclad boats, "mopped up" Haihe Village from Xinghua City, and were blocked by local people's armed forces at Guojia Bridge, killing or wounding more than 120 Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers below the gunboat captain level.
