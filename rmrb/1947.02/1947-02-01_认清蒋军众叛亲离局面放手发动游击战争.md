Wherever the KMT army goes, they seize men and laborers, wildly collect taxes, rape, plunder, making it impossible for the poor to survive, leading to widespread resentment and desertion. Its social foundation is very small. Today's newspaper publishes news from the KMT-occupied areas of Anyang, Daming, and Jining. From these reports, it can be seen that the KMT army's conscription and grain robbery are becoming increasingly frenzied. In Jining City, the number of conscripts per bao (unit of 100 households) has increased from four in October to eight now. In Anyang, each mu (unit of land) is forcibly taxed at 50,000 yuan, resulting in "land becoming a tumor for the people." Conscripting laborers to build pillboxes is even more common, with even women being conscripted. They have demolished houses that even the traitors didn't tear down. No wonder the people say, "The KMT army is worse than the Japanese." Conscription, grain robbery, seizing laborers... none of these can the KMT army avoid, because without them, they cannot fight. And every one of these is bitterly opposed by the people. Even landlords cannot escape. Their wives and daughters are raped, their money is confiscated, and they are even forced into the army... Some landlords have been driven to hanging themselves or jumping into wells. Except for a few die-hard despotic landlords, they can no longer tolerate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities and "benevolent governance." The fact that seven landlords from Xiabaishu, Anyang, fled to our liberated area is yet another proof of this.

Some of our cadres, for a time, underestimated this situation, mistakenly believing today's war to be a class war, with landlords and the KMT army being of one mind, oppressing us everywhere. Therefore, they lacked confidence in launching guerrilla warfare in the KMT-occupied areas and dared not move forward. With the KMT army's major defeats and the development of guerrilla warfare in vast areas, this thinking is gradually changing. And because of this change, guerrilla warfare in many areas has achieved significant results. However, it is still necessary to thoroughly liquidate this thinking. The more thorough the liquidation, the more beneficial it will be for us to boldly and comprehensively launch guerrilla warfare to strive for the early arrival of victory.

The people of all strata in the KMT-occupied areas are reaching out to us for help. We should bravely advance, resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's call and the Central Bureau's instructions for launching guerrilla warfare: when the enemy advances, we advance; even when the enemy does not advance, we still advance. Boldly and freely, organize the people in the occupied areas to launch guerrilla warfare. Let us ignite guerrilla flames everywhere in the occupied areas, and set off a tide of resistance everywhere. We are sure to be victorious.

### 认清蒋军众叛亲离局面放手发动游击战争

　　认清蒋军众叛亲离局面放手发动游击战争
    蒋军所到之处，抓丁抓夫，狂征暴敛，奸淫掳掠，贫常难活，众叛亲离，他的社会基础是很小的。今日本报发表了安阳、大名、济宁三地蒋军侵陷区的消息，从这些消息中可以看出：蒋军抓丁抢粮日益疯狂；济宁市十月份每保抽丁四名，现在竟增加到八名；安阳每亩地已强征到五万元，结果，“土地已成人民毒瘤。”至抓丁修碉堡更是常事，连妇女都抓去出夫了，汉奸所未拆掉的房屋他们拆掉了，怪不得老百姓说：“蒋军还不如日军。”抓丁、抢粮、抓夫……不论那一宗都是蒋军不能不做的，不做就不能打仗，而不论那一宗都是人民所切齿反对的。即地主也无法幸免，妻女被强奸，钱财被征去，甚至还抓他去当兵……有些地主已经被逼的上了吊，投了井，除了少数死心的恶霸地主，他们对卖国贼蒋介石的暴行和“德政”也已经不能再忍受了，安阳下柏树七个地主的逃来我解放区，就是这种事实的又一次证明。
    我们有些干部，曾在一个时期内对这种情况估计不足，误认今天的战争为阶级战争，地主和蒋军一条心，处处逼害我们，因而对于在蒋占区开展游击战争，信心不足，不敢前进。随着蒋军的大吃败仗与广大地区游击战争的开展，这种思想是在逐渐改变中，而且因为这种改变，不少地区的游击战争已获得了重大成绩，但这种思想仍有彻底清算的必要，清算得越彻底，对我们大踏步的全面开展游击战争以争取胜利的早日到来便越有利。
    蒋军侵陷区的各阶层人民正向我们伸手求助，我们应该英勇前进，坚决执行朱总司令的号召与中央局开展游击战争的指示：敌进我进，敌不进我亦进，大胆放手，组织沦陷区人民开展游击战争，让我们在沦陷区遍地燃起游击烽火，遍地掀起反抗怒潮，我们是一定可以胜利的。
