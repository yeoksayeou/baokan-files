    Solving Production Difficulties After Emancipation
    Qinghe Organizes Livestock Breeding
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 5th] After land reform in Nanqinghe Village, Zanhuang, farmers keenly felt the lack of draught animals. The village currently has a total of 70 cattle and donkeys, a decrease of 20 from before the war. Based on the village's land area, it still lacks more than 30 animals. The Jinnan Bank County Branch has provided a draught animal breeding loan, and dispatched Secretary Cui and others from the bank to assist the village in planning draught animal breeding work. Currently, the village's draught animal breeding committee has been established, composed of the village chief, cooperative head, and representatives elected from the four streets. The plan is for the cooperative to buy a good stud donkey, guaranteeing that the existing 32 female donkeys will produce 25 donkey foals in the next two years. Establish a cattle herd, and prepare experienced herdsmen for grazing. The seven fertile cows will guarantee the birth of seven calves next year. In this way, the village's livestock power will exceed pre-war levels within three years. It also calls on the village to gradually replace existing steers with fertile cows, and old stud donkeys with female donkeys, and to mobilize the organization of small draught animal cooperatives to raise female donkeys and fertile cows. Currently, livestock breeding has formed a movement in the village, with streets competing with streets, and households competing with households, protecting female donkeys and pregnant donkeys.
