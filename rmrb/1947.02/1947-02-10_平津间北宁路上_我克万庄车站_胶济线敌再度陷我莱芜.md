    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th] To impede the transportation of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the civil war, after capturing Anding Station and most of Weishanzhuang Station on the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway on the night of January 29th, troops of the Eighth Route Army liberated Wanzhuang Station (130 *li* southeast of Beiping) on January 31st, and briefly captured Lutai Station, 40 *li* north of Tianjin, on the 5th of this month. All of Chiang's military's pillbox fortifications were destroyed, capturing over 50 Chiang soldiers, including a company commander, and seizing over 50 rifles and three machine guns.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Shandong, 8th] To coordinate Chiang's army's large-scale offensive against southern Shandong, the 12th Army of Chiang's army and a portion of the American-equipped 46th Division on the Jiaoji Railway launched a new offensive against the Central Shandong liberated area at the beginning of the month. They reoccupied Laiwu city on the 5th and are currently expanding towards Xintai. The invading Chiang army encountered resistance from the Eighth Route Army and the militia in Central Shandong at every step. From the 2nd to the 5th, nearly 200 Chiang soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured. Their rear supply lines have been repeatedly sabotaged. For this reason, Chiang's army has specially allocated a division of the 73rd Army to defend it.
