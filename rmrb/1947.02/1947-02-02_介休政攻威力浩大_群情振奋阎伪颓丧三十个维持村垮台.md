(This dispatch is) from Taiyue on the 29th of this month: Since Jiexiu launched its political offensive, landlords and despots have not dared to settle old scores, and desertions from Yan's army are increasing daily. In December, the army and people of Jiexiu combined the annihilation of the enemy with a joint military and political offensive. County and district cadres personally participated in the leadership, penetrating deep into the enemy's heartland to carry out activities. More than 3,000 slogans were distributed and posted inside strongholds and on bunker walls, and slogans in more than 120 villages were altered. More than 500 mass meetings were held, and more than 10,000 people heard news of our army's victories. They demanded to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army from within, acting in coordination with attacks from outside. Some even sent their children to join the militia. In × village, two tenant farmers mobilized their sons to join the militia. The Second and Seventh Districts also convened meetings of landlords, conducted policy education, and especially visited tenant farmers' homes to comfort and support them. Under the mighty power of the military and political offensive, many landlords turned back, and traitors and bullies did not dare to settle old scores. Thirty "maintenance villages" were completely destroyed. The morale of Yan's puppet troops was demoralized, and 230 people fled to the liberated areas in half a month. The democratic government has given them appropriate resettlement.

　　介休政攻威力浩大
    群情振奋阎伪颓丧三十个维持村垮台
    【本报太岳二十九日电】介休自展开政治攻势以来，地主恶霸不敢倒算，阎又逃亡日增。介休军民，十二月曾结合歼敌运动，对敌进行军事政治联合攻势，县区干部亲身参加领导，深入敌人心脏活动，将三千余条标语发散张贴到据点内及碉堡墙上，涂改了一百二十余村的标语，召开群众大会五百余次，约一万以上群众听到我军胜利消息，他们要求在内部配合八路军里应外合，有些还将自己子弟送入民兵。×村即有两个佃户动员自己儿子参加民兵，二、七区并召开了地主会议，进行了政策教育，尤其深入佃户家中访问，给以安慰与撑腰。在军事政治攻势威力下，许多地主回头，奸霸不敢倒算，三十个维持村完全摧毁，阎伪军士气颓丧，半月中即有二百三十人逃来解放区，民主政府均予以适当安置。
