[Report from Taiyue, February 19th] In the late stage of the mass movement in various regions, disputes between cadres and the masses generally occurred. The masses in the first district of Qinshui said, "The fruits of the spring struggle are monopolized by village cadres and are not distributed fairly." Zhao Genshuan opposed the village chief buying a house, and the village chief used public office for private revenge, falsely accusing Zhao Genshuan and parading him through the streets. After the director of the Beiliu Village Farmers' Association in Yangcheng led the masses to overthrow the feudal "four pillars," he became complacent and alienated from the masses. In Pan Village, Shiming, where "land to the tiller" had been achieved, many people believed that the cadres were "new stone slabs" to be struggled against during the review. From the problems that have occurred, there are several reasons: First, cadres' unfair handling of the fruits of labor in the struggle is the main reason, with some cadres being selfish and taking more fruits of labor. Second, cadres do have great contributions in the movement, and therefore become arrogant and issue administrative orders. Third, a few cadres have bad elements, retaliate against people with personal grudges, and even tie them up. In dealing with these problems, various regions have created some experiences: the "household affairs meeting" in Gaoping, the "mutual assistance and concession" in Changzi, etc. Generally, the self-criticism starts from the cadres themselves, and those who have obtained more fruits of labor withdraw them. Some admit their mistakes and withdraw the fruits of labor in the general assembly, and some adopt the method of "distributing the fruits of labor." Cadres in Yangcheng, Gongzhuling, Baisang, Hujia, and other places distribute the extra fruits of labor they have obtained. Secondly, cadres should be persuaded and educated, explaining that cadres do have merits, but this is the responsibility of the cadres, so it is absolutely impossible to take strike methods against cadres. On the other hand, the first work carried out among the masses is to distinguish whether the opinions on cadres are from the majority or a minority or individuals? After distinguishing clearly, the opinions of the majority of people hold unity meetings and thought meetings, where they review the process of their own liberation and whether the cadres have made contributions? Are the cadres' merits greater or the errors greater? Are the cadres their own people or outsiders? According to materials from various regions, the problem is quickly resolved once the meeting is held. Pan Village proposed that "cadres work day and night for our liberation, and even their own land is deserted." With just these few words, many people who had opinions recognized the cadres' contributions. Some awakened and even wept bitterly, saying that they should not struggle against their own people. If it is the opinion of a minority of individuals, it can be resolved individually. Finally, follow-up work should be carried out. First Chuan once publicized and explained that the problem between cadres and the masses is a "family affair"; they also publicized the merits of the cadres, held unity conferences, cadres reflected, and the masses praised, resolving the contradictions and becoming a family again.

　　沁源士敏等地
    干部自动匀果实
    干群关系大改善
    【本报太岳十九日电】各地群运末期，普遍发生干部与群众纠纷问题，沁源第一区群众说：“春天斗争的果实，由村干部包办，处理的不公道”。赵根拴因反对村长买房子，村长假公报私，将赵根拴加上罪名游街。阳城北留村农会主任，领导群众斗垮封建“四大柱”后，居功自大，脱离群众。已实现耕者有其田的士敏潘庄，在复查中，不少人认为干部是“新石板”要斗争。从所发生的问题中去看，有这几个原因：一、斗争中干部处理果实不公是主要的，有些干部自私自利多分果实。二、干部在运动中确实有很大功劳，因此自高自大行政命令。三、少数干部成份不好，对有些私仇的人报仇，甚至捆绑。在处理这些问题上各地都创造了一些经验：高平“家务会议”，长子“互助互让”等。一般先从干部本身检讨起，多得果实的退出。有的在大会承认错误并退出果实，有的采取“匀果实”办法。阳城、公主岭、白桑、护驾等干部把多得的果实匀出来。其次对干部要进行说服教育，说明干部确实有功，但这是干部的责任，因此绝对不能对干部采取打击方法。另一方面在群众中进行的第一个工作，是分别对干部意见是大多数人的还是少数或个别人的？分别清楚后，大多数人的意见召开团结会议、想想会议，在会上进行检讨，想自己翻身经过，干部有没有功劳？干部功劳大还是错误大？干部是自己人还是外头人？据各地材料，一经开会以后，问题很快得到解决。潘庄提出“干部为咱们翻身，白日黑夜工作，连自己的地都荒了”。就这几句话，许多有意见的人都认识干部功劳了。有些觉悟甚至痛哭流涕说不该斗自己人。若是少数人个别人的意见，可进行个别解决。最后要进行善后工作。第一川曾宣传解释干部与群众的问题是“家务问题”；又宣传干部的功劳，召开团结大会，干部反省，群众表功，解决了矛盾，又成为一家人。
