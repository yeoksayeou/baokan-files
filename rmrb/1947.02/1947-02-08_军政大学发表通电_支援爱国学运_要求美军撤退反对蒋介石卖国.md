    Military and Political University Issues Circular Telegram
    Supporting Patriotic Student Movement
    Demanding Withdrawal of US Troops and Opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's Treason
    [This newspaper dispatch] News from the Military and Political University: Upon hearing the news of the rape of a female student by American soldiers in Beiping, cadres and students of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military Region's Military and Political University were extremely indignant. Then, seeing that young students in Ping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing had all taken action on this matter, they were even more excited. In the midst of universal indignation, they issued a circular telegram to the whole country on January 10, responding to the patriotic actions of students in major cities, demanding that US troops immediately get out of China. The telegram stated: "The Chinese nation fought a desperate war for freedom and liberation against the Japanese invaders for eight years. Countless bloodshed and sacrifices won the victory of the War of Resistance, but the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to continue their dictatorial rule, are unscrupulously offering all national sovereignty to American imperialism, striving for massive aid to carry out their shameless traitorous policy of bloody civil war and mass slaughter against the Chinese people, which is about to ruin everything!...Let our fervent, sincere, millions of patriotic young hearts be tightly linked together, and use even stronger struggles to urge the US military to get out of China!"
