　　Everyone is the Master, Everyone Manages the Household
    Experience in Rectifying Street Finances in Dongguan, Xiyang New District
  (1) Ideologically Mobilizing the Masses to Consciously Rectify Village Finances
    The village expenditures in Dongguan Street, Xiyang, were more than double the Border Region's grain tax. Village funds were mostly collected through "mobilization." During mobilization, cadres often took the lead to influence the masses. Some people, in order to "win honor" and "appear enlightened," even contributed more. In addition to "mobilization" at public schools and mass meetings, village funds were also "mobilized" according to various systems. The masses thought that this was something they should contribute, and no one wanted to be called "backward." The masses paid little attention to public property. Dongguan originally had two "official cattle," and some cadres and masses knew about it but did not ask about it, allowing it to be used privately for a year. Furthermore, most cadres did not pay attention to village financial work, thinking that it was only the responsibility of the finance committee member. When the Street Financial Management Committee held meetings, they invited the director of the Armed Forces Committee to participate, and he said, "That's your part of the work, what am I going to do there?"
    In order to implement the new policy of village funds raised by the village and managed by the village, and not collecting from the masses, the leadership first cleared the thinking of cadres and masses. First, the masses were mobilized to elect representatives to form the Street Management Committee, and an accurate survey of village expenditures was conducted. Then, the government's instructions on rectifying village finances were conveyed at the public school, and the difference between village funds and Border Region grain tax was clearly compared. To more profoundly arouse the attention of the masses, typical households from each class were selected for comparative education. After specific calculations, Liu Sandan said, "In the past, the government said that public grain tax was only paid once a year, but later there were frequent mobilizations, and I couldn't understand it. Today's rectification of village finances really strikes my heart." The enthusiasm of cadres and masses for rectifying village finances was raised, and they proposed to organize street public property into production to solve the difficulty of expenditures.
  (2) Mass-Based Sorting Out of Village Public Property
    In the past, everyone said that Dongguan had no public property, but now the masses have started the rectification work together. As a result, a lot of warehouse grain, livestock, materials, and timber have been found. Children also actively participated in this work. Li Quanhe exposed Li Chengying's embezzlement of 1,600 silver dollars.
    Facts show that the rectification of village public property must rely on the masses, and a few cadres cannot complete the task. However, two points should be noted: First, the village public property and county public property, especially the fruits of the masses' struggle, should be strictly distinguished, otherwise it will affect mass movements; second, differentiate between wealthy households and the newly turned-over poor and impoverished households. If the latter have eaten warehouse grain, asking them to pay it back will affect their lives.
  (3) Tightening Expenditures and Compiling Budgets
    After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, street cadres and the masses developed the idea of peace, thinking that after driving away the Japanese invaders, there would be no more difficulties. Cadres were extravagant and wasteful in their expenditures, and took pride in "mobilizing" more. Dongguan mobilized 80,000 yuan for a gas lamp in one go. The masses also felt that "it doesn't matter if you pay a little more, it's peace, you can go to big places to make money." Li Haihe said, "When the county council was in session, Zhang Yuan and others asked me to buy a pig with him to comfort the county councilors. In those days, they were calling for the recovery of Yangquan. I thought it was okay to send a pig, I was not afraid of failing to earn money in Yangquan in the future?" This proves that cadres and the masses were blinded by the idea of peace and did not take a long-term view. Therefore, in the process of tightening expenditures and compiling budgets, it is necessary to conduct education to break the illusion of peace and overcome financial difficulties. Due to the progress of this work and specific calculations, Dongguan's village expenditure budget was reduced by 130,000 yuan compared to last year.
  (4) Integrating Financial Management with Production
    This year, Dongguan originally planned to sell part of the public property to organize several types of production. The ones that have already been established are a sugar mill, a nail-shoe shop, and a shop (existing last year). They plan to open a carpentry shop and invest some funds in a dyeing workshop. It is estimated that the capital of the sugar mill is 100,000 yuan. After it ends, it will be converted into a koji-making and dyeing workshop, and it can earn 300,000 yuan throughout the year. The nail-shoe shop guarantees to earn 128,000 yuan. The shop has existing capital of 20,000 yuan and can earn 60,000 yuan. A total of 623,000 yuan can be earned. According to this calculation, it is guaranteed that village funds will not be collected from the masses this year.

    新区昔阳东关整顿街财政经验
  （一）从思想上发动群众自觉的整顿村财政
    昔阳东关街的村开支，比边区粮款多一倍还有余。村款多是用“动员”的方法征集的。动员时大半是干部带头影响群众。有的人为了“争光荣”、“落开明”，还要多出一些。若干村款，除了在民校、群众大会上“动员”外，还要按各系统“动员”。群众在思想上认为这是应该出的，谁也不愿让人说“落后”。群众对公产多不注意，东关原有两头“官牛”，若干干部、群众明知道也不过问，一年来只是任人私用。再就是一般干部不重视村财政工作，认为这只是财政委员的事。街财政管理委员会开会时，请武委会主任参加，他说：“那是你们那部分的事，俺去干啥？”
    为要贯彻村款村筹村管，不向群众征集的新方针，领导上便先打通干部群众思想；于是首先发动群众选出代表，组成街管委会，并对村开支作了精确调查。接着在民校传达了政府整顿村财政的指示，把村款与边区粮款差额作了明确对比。为更深刻的引起群众注意，又从每个阶层中提出典型户来进行对比教育。经过具体计算，刘三旦说：“以前，政府说一年只出一次公粮款，后来却是常常动员，我就闹不通。今天要整顿村财政，很碰我的心。”干部、群众整顿村财政的热情提高起来了，纷纷提出整理街公产投入生产，解决开支困难。
  （二）群众性的整理村公产
    以前大家都说东关没公产的，现在群众一齐下手进行整顿工作。结果，弄出不少仓谷、牲畜、物资、林木。儿童也积极的参加了这一工作。李全和就揭发出李成英贪污的一千六百元大洋。
    事实说明，整顿村公产必须依靠群众，少数干部是完不成任务的。但须注意两点：一、村公产与县公产，特别是群众斗争果实严格划清，不然会影响群运；二、区别富裕户与赤贫新翻身户。如系后者吃了仓谷，再让他还清，就会影响他的生活。
  （三）紧缩开支编造预算
    日寇投降后，街干部和群众都产生了和平思想，认为打走日寇，什么困难也没有了。干部在开支上，铺张浪费，“动员”以多为荣。东关买汽灯，一次就动员了八万元。群众也觉得“多出点，不要紧，和平啦，可以到大地方去赚钱”。李亥和说：“开县议会时，张元等叫我和他伙买一口猪，慰劳县议员。那几天，正喊叫收复阳泉，我想送一口猪也可以，将来到阳泉还怕赚不下钱？”这可证明干部与群众因和平思想作怪，而不从长期着眼。因此，在进行紧缩开支编造预算时，需进行打破和平幻想，克服财经困难的教育。由于这一工作的进行与具体计算，东关的村开支预算，比去年减少十三万元。
  （四）财政管理与生产结合
    今年东关原计划将公产物卖出一部，组织几种生产，现在已经搞起来的有一座糖坊，一个钉鞋铺，一座店房（去年原有），打算叫开一座木匠铺，并另抽一部分款投资染坊。预计糖坊资本十万元，结束后转为造曲、染坊，全年可获利三十万元。钉鞋铺保证赚十二万八千元。店房现有资本二万元，可获利六万元。共可获利六十二万三千元。这样计算下来，保证今年村款不向群众征收。
