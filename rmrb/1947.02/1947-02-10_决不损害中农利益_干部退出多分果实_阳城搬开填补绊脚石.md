    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] According to responsible comrades of the Yangcheng County Committee, the reason why 172 villages in Yangcheng County were able to universally carry out land reform and check-up, and even carry out work vigorously during the Lunar New Year, is due to two reasons: (1) Adhering to the principle of not touching the middle peasants' interests and dissuading the middle peasants from donating land. Before the movement, many middle peasants were quite fearful. For example, the middle peasants in Qiangmu Village secretly sold their livestock, and several middle peasants in Xunyang went to Jincheng to understand the "communist situation." Later, it was clearly announced that filling and leveling was to cut off the tail of feudalism, not to forcibly take the land of one group of peasants to fill up another group of peasants, thereby breaking the middle peasants' concerns and promoting the development of the movement. (2) Beginning to transform the work style of cadres, and under the slogan of "distributing the fruits evenly," cadres withdrew the excessive fruits they had obtained. For example, the cadres of Shijiazhuang, Baisang, and Hujia withdrew the excessive fruits and cheap purchases, thereby strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, removing the "stumbling blocks" on the road to the movement's progress. Therefore, this movement in Yangcheng can proceed normally and be completed quickly.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] Xiguan in Yangcheng has completed the filling and leveling, and celebrated the emancipation on the Lantern Festival, announcing the transformation of poor Xiguan into rich Xiguan. The land temple where the meeting was held was changed to Emancipation Paradise, and the fourteenth day of the first month was designated as Emancipation Day. On this day, all men and women in Xiguan Street changed out of their tattered old clothes and put on new blue clothes. Everyone was radiant with joy, and Old Woman Wei murmured like chanting scriptures, "We were emancipated thanks to Chairman Mao." At the meeting, Wang Xiaosui, the chairman of the farmers' association, reported on the process of emancipation. Village Chief Wei called for a second great emancipation—to engage in production and get rich, suggesting developing side occupations, opening a flour mill, and a coal kiln, and that women should spin two liang of cotton every day, and poor Xiguan would become rich Xiguan. The emancipated peasants unanimously resolved to engage in production and get rich.

    决不损害中农利益
    干部退出多分果实
    阳城搬开填补绊脚石
    【本报太岳八日电】据阳城县委会负责同志谈，阳城全县一百七十二个村子得以普遍进行翻身检查，甚至在旧历新年也能轰轰烈烈进行工作，其原因有两个：（一）坚持不动中农的原则，劝止了中农献田。在运动前，许多中农相当恐惧，如枪木村中农偷偷的卖了牲口，训阳几个中农特到晋城去了解“共产情况”，后经明确宣布填平补齐是割封建尾巴，不是硬拿这一部分农民土地去填另一部分农民，从而打破了中农的顾虑，推动了运动的开展。（二）开始改造了干部作风，并在“匀果实”的口号下，干部退出了多得果实，如史家庄、白桑、护驾干部退出了多得及贱买的果实，从而密切了干部与群众的关系，搬去运动进展道上的“绊脚石”，因此阳城这次运动，能正常的并将迅速完成。
    【本报太岳八日电】阳城西关已完成填平补齐，于元宵节那天，庆祝翻身，宣布了把穷西关变成富西关，又把开会地方的土地庙改为翻身乐园，订正月十四日为翻身节日。这天西关街上男女一律换下了破烂的旧衣服，穿上了蓝色的新衣服，人逢喜事精神爽，个个眉开眼笑，卫老太太念经似的呢喃着“靠毛主席翻了身”。开会时，农会主席王小随报告了翻身经过，尉村长号召还袭来第二次大翻身——闹生产发财致富，建议发展副业，开设一座粉坊，一座煤窑，妇女每天得纺二两花，穷西关就会变成富西关。翻身农民一致下决心闹生产发财。
