　　[Reported from] Taihang, 20th [of the month] – Following financial reorganization in Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang, Xianghe, Heshun, Xiyang, and six other counties in the central area of the Second Administrative Region, production organization and indirect income have reached the point where local landlords' grain funds are completely self-sufficient. On average, across all twelve counties in the administrative region, it is estimated that the burden on the people can be reduced by 20%. Furthermore, as the above-mentioned six counties still have a surplus of income, it has been decided to collect 5 million yuan from these counties to support PindDing, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, and Qixian, as militia ammunition expenses for carrying out guerrilla warfare.

    地方粮款完全自给
    【本报太行二十日电】二专区腹地左权、榆社、武乡、襄和、和顺、昔阳等六县财政经整理后，组织生产与间接收入均已达到地主粮款完全自给。全专区十二县平均，计可减轻人民负担百分之二十。除此各县收入尚可长余，特再决定由以上六县集款五百万元支援平定、寿阳、榆次、太谷、祁县等，作为民兵弹药费，开展游击战争。
