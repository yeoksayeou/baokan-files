    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 5th] Representatives from all sectors of Hebei-Shandong-Henan gathered to support the national patriotic student movement, oppose the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty, and support the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's designation of November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day. A conference was held in Zhangqiu on the morning of the 25th of last month. Deputy Director Jia of the Administrative Police first gave an impromptu speech. Deputy Commander Liu of the military region and Comrade Guo Ying, representative of the agricultural women's and youth joint association, and County Magistrate Wang of Zhangqiu County and the representative of the Zhangqiu County Women's Association spoke successively, unanimously denouncing the atrocities of the American soldiers, explaining that the rape of a Peking University female student by American soldiers was just one of thousands of atrocities. If there were no American troops stationed in China assisting Chiang Kai-shek, then Chiang Kai-shek would never dare to carry out the civil war. The magnificent movement of students across the country demanding that American troops get out and demanding that Chiang Kai-shek change his slavish diplomacy and traitorous policies is a signal of a new high tide in the Chinese people's patriotic movement. We, the military and civilians of the liberated areas, resolutely support it and pledge to be the backing, and American troops must get out of China. We must win more battles, eliminate more of Chiang's troops, strive for the victory of the overall counter-offensive, and use this practical action to support the student movement. The speakers unanimously agreed that the most shameful traitorous "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" must be eradicated. At the end of the meeting, a telegram was sent in response to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's clear order to designate November 4th as National Humiliation Memorial Day.
