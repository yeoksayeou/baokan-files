　　Taihang Organizes Labor Mutual Aid and Barter
    Unifying Leadership for War Production
    [Our Newspaper News] Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Zhu Muzhi reports: The people of the Taihang area, with a high degree of organization, have overcome the contradiction between participating in the war and production. Now, the unified leadership of war participation and production has been universally implemented in various places. The labor exchange committees, war participation committees, headquarters, or cooperatives and mutual aid teams uniformly control the labor and animal power of the entire village. Generally, all labor and animal power is divided into several teams, which take turns participating in the war and take turns in production. For example, Renzhuang Village in Licheng County, based on the original three mutual aid brigades, is divided into three corvée brigades, and each team also divides a portion of labor and animal power to operate workshops in the village to be ready for corvée duties at any time. Wangjinzhuang Village in She County is divided into three lines: the first line produces near the village; the second line does not leave the village far; the third line can go far. Each line has specialized transportation links. If the first line is insufficient to cope with corvée duties, it will find the second line, and if that is insufficient, it will find the third line, thus overcoming the drawbacks of the whole village waiting for corvée duties or being in a temporary state of confusion. All localities have also implemented large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear, with those at the front participating in the war guaranteeing the completion of war participation tasks, and those at the rear guaranteeing that no land is left uncultivated. The man-days consumed by war participation and production are ultimately accounted for uniformly. During the busy farming season, all farming tasks are first completed for the first batch of those participating in the war, so that they can participate in the war with peace of mind. During war participation, all gaps are used for production. For example, 300 stretcher-bearers in She County earned more than 300,000 by transporting goods in their spare time during war participation. Hediao Village in Heshun County earned more than 210,000 yuan by carrying goods on the return trip during 20 days of grain transportation. The Heshun County military stations established mills, organizing labor and animal power waiting for corvée duties at the stations to engage in production. The mobilization of women, children, and the elderly is the main method to make up for the lack of labor. According to statistics from Licheng, She, and Wu'an counties, last year the organization of children, women, and the elderly to participate in production reached 67 percent of the total number of semi-labor force. Licheng and other counties have also implemented large-scale labor exchange between villages, with neighboring villages with abundant labor assisting when the labor force in one village is insufficient, and then returning the labor later.

　　太行组织劳力互助变工
    统一领导参战生产
    【本报讯】新华社特派记者朱穆之报导：太行区人民以高度的组织起来，克服了参战与生产间的矛盾。现在各地已普遍的实行了参战生产的统一领导。变工委员会、参战委员会、指挥部或即依托合作社互助队统一支配着全村的劳畜力。一般的把所有劳畜力分成几个队，轮流参战，轮流生产。如黎城仁庄村依原有三个互助大队，分为三个支差大队，每队又分出一部分劳畜力在村经营作坊等，以便随时应差。涉县王金庄则分为三线，第一线在村附近生产；第二线不远离村；第三线可远出。每线有专门交通联系，第一线不足应付差务时，即找第二线，再不足找第三线，这样克服了全村候差或临时手忙脚乱的弊病。各地也都实行了前后方大变工，前方参战者保证完成参战任务，后方生产者保证不荒芜一块用地，参战与生产所耗费的工数最后统一算账。在农忙时，首先为第一批轮到参战者赶完一切农务，使参战者可以安心参战。在参战中一切空隙皆被利用进行生产。如涉县三百付担架中，在参战中抽空运输赚了三十余万。和顺灰调曲村在二十天运粮中，利用往返空隙捎带运输，赚了二十一万余元。和顺各兵站则成立磨坊，组织在兵站候差的劳畜力进行生产。妇女、儿童、老年人总动员则为补足劳力缺乏的主要方法。据黎城、涉县、武安等三县统计，去年组织儿童、妇女、老年参加生产者达全半劳力总数的百分之六十七。黎城等县更实行了村与村的大变工，本村劳力不足，由邻近劳力富裕的村庄襄助，以后再还工。
