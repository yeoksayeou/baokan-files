The Fifth Military Sub-district Armed Work Team is leading the masses in reversing the land reform in enemy-occupied areas. Once, when the Armed Work Team advanced into a village less than two miles away from a stronghold, a military dependent secretly came to us to complain. He said, "When the Central Army came, some local bullies and landlords also came with them, returning to the village and forcing other landlords to join them in demanding rent back from the masses. After taking back the original amount, they also fined each member of the farmers' association fifty to five hundred catties of wheat. Military dependents are punished even more severely. The land that the peasants had obtained since the War of Resistance Against Japan has been forced back, and they have to pay seventy-five catties of rent per mu. Now they are being extorted of all their grain and land." He tearfully said, "I didn't keep even one mu of land, not a single liter of grain, and a cart of sweet potatoes and a thousand catties of wheat stalks are about to be confiscated. My family is about to starve. There are dozens of families in our village in this situation." The next day, the Armed Work Team held a meeting in the village, explaining that Chiang Kai-shek was bound to fail and that the things taken back by the landlords during the reversal must be seized back. This further encouraged the morale of the masses. Under the suppression of the Armed Work Team, more than a dozen landlords returned the grain to the masses. A certain landlord even apologized to the masses, saying: "It's not my fault, it was led by ×× (a landlord)." Now, our Armed Work Team is holding meetings everywhere, leading the masses in reversing the land reform reversal.

    冀鲁豫五分区武工队
    领导群众反倒算  
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】五分区武工队在敌后领导群众反倒算。有一次武工队挺进离据点不到二里路的某村活动时，一位军属偷偷地找到我们诉苦，他说：“中央军来了，有些恶霸地主也跟着来了，回到村里，逼着其他地主和他一块叫群众倒租，原数要走后，又罚在农会的每个五十斤到五百斤麦子。军属罪加一等。自抗战以来农民得到的土地，都被迫倒回去，每亩还要七十五斤租子，现在叫他们讹诈的粮光地净。”他落泪说：“我地一亩也没留，粮食一升也没剩，一车红薯和一千斤麦秸，也快没收完，眼下大人孩子就要饿起来。像这种情形在俺庄上就有几十家。”第二天武工队即在这村开了会，讲明老蒋必败，地主倒算的东西一定要夺回来。这样更鼓舞了群众的情绪，在武工队的镇压下，十几个地主把粮食退还了群众，某地主并向群众道歉说：这不怨我，是××（地主）排头办的。现我武工队各处开会，领导群众反倒算。
