Lian Zhizhong's Armed Work Team

The armed work team led by Lian Zhizhong was organized by peasants who had just been emancipated. They were all farmers "with mud from wheat stalks on their legs and sorghum flowers on their heads." They had never fought before, and some had never even touched a gun, but they had a heart for revenge and defending their homes. As team member Liu Chunyu said, "We just had a good time, and the stubborn army came and caused our families to suffer. We must fight these sons of bitches!" In the past few months, they have fought bravely, defended their hometowns, and won commendations from the sub-district military committee, earning them the reputation of being the most坚强的 armed work team in the area.

When the enemy attacked the豫北 plain last year, the emancipated peasants of Xiuwu temporarily left their homes and moved to the mountains. Comrade Lian Zhizhong from the second district of Xiuwu organized a guerrilla team from the relocated peasants. Facing the enemy, they continuously crushed several major enemy mopping-up operations in dozens of days. The team did not suffer any losses. In October last year, the enemy attempted to remove this thorn in their side, using two regiments to pounce on them, but they were again crushed by the armed work team. The enemy paid the price of more than thirty lives, while the armed work team suffered no casualties. On another occasion, the Lian Zhizhong armed work team was ordered to blockade the enemy in Hanwangzhuang. They endured a torrential rain, went hungry for a day and a night, and finally completed their mission.

The enemy was frightened by them, and small groups no longer dared to come out. Those special agent armed forces were even more terrified at the sound of their names. They often went deep behind enemy lines and took the initiative to attack, capturing alive ×× special agents and despots, holding four large mass rallies, and launching political offensives against the enemy strongholds. They posted more than two hundred notices and propaganda materials near the enemy strongholds, causing the enemy to panic.

Every member of Lian Zhizhong's armed work team knows: we are all ordinary people, fighting to protect the interests of the people, so we are supported by the masses everywhere. After repelling the enemy who robbed grain in Zuiwan, the masses brought chickens and eggs to give to the armed work team. The masses said gratefully, "If it weren't for Old Lian and the others, those sons of bitches (referring to the enemy) would dare to come out even in groups of three, and all the grain and things on our mountain would be robbed." When the family members of the team members saw that their sons were supported by the people, they wrote letters telling their children, "Follow Comrade Old Lian and do a good job!"

The consolidation and strength of this peasant armed force is inseparable from the leadership of Comrade Lian Zhizhong. In every battle, he always took the lead, directing the team members to set up positions, so that the armed work team never suffered losses. Therefore, the team members often said to the new team members, "Listen to Old Lian, and you'll be safe." In the heavy rain, Comrade Zhizhong guarded the mountain top with the team members, and the team members said with emotion, "Old Lian can endure hardships like this, how can we not do a good job?!" When carrying grain, the team members only carried eighteen pounds, but he carried thirty-nine pounds. The second time, everyone automatically carried more, with the least carrying forty pounds. He also led everyone to intensify their military training, training these farmers with no combat experience into brave and战善 soldiers. During the gaps in the war, he personally led the team members to learn how to throw grenades, shoot, and lay mines, and explained using examples. On the battlefield, he directed everyone to use the terrain. After the battle, he promptly reviewed and educated the team members. He also conducted reading and explained current events during peacetime. When the enemy's offensive was at its most frenzied, some team members thought, "There are so many enemies, how can we persevere?!" Comrade Zhizhong calculated the victory account for the team members to break through their thinking. For example, in the Xiuwu County's struggle against the enemy, more than thirty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed or wounded in dozens of days, and we were only injured two. This further increased the militia's confidence in fighting the enemy.

He also cared very much about the lives of the team members and was not afraid to solve their practical problems. He often said, "Without solving practical problems, you can't get through to their thinking just by talking." Team member Li Jinglai's clothes were very thin, so he quickly found a pair of cotton pants for Li. Li Daixiang's family was starving, so he found a few斗 of grain for him. Zai Tianxi was sick, and he personally took care of him. Zai Tianxi said with emotion, "Even my own parents wouldn't do this." One team member returned home without asking for leave. After returning, Comrade Zhizhong did not criticize him, but first asked if his family was well, and then asked what difficulties his family had. The team member said, "The grain was not moved out." Comrade Zhizhong immediately sent several team members to help him move the grain. This team member was very moved. This growing peasant armed force has now become a heart disease for the Chiang Kai-shek puppets in northern Henan.

### 连志中的武工队

　　连志中的武工队
    连志中领导的武工队，是刚刚翻身的农民组织起来的，他们都是“两腿麦秸泥，一头高粱花”的庄稼人，以前都没有打过仗，有的连枪也没摸过，但是他们却有一颗复仇保家的心。正如该队队员刘春玉说的：“刚才有了好时光，顽固军就来了，闹的全家老少受这样的洋罪。非和狗日的拚不行！”几个月来，他们不断的英勇作战，保卫了自己的家乡，荣获了分区武委会通令表扬，誉为该区最坚强的武工队。
    当去年敌人进攻豫北平原时，修武边地翻身农民就暂时离开家乡转移到山地里来，翻身队里连志中同志，当时就将修武二区的转移农民组织起一支游击队，在敌人对面，数十天内连续粉碎了敌人几次大的扫荡，该队未受丝毫损失，在去年十月份，敌人企图拔掉这个眼中钉，用两个团兵力，向他们猛扑，又被武工队粉碎了。敌人付了三十多条生命的代价，武工队毫无伤亡。又一次，连志中武工队奉命封锁汉王庄之敌，在倾盆大雨里，饿着肚子坚持了一天一夜，终于完成了任务。
    敌人被他们打怕了，小股的不敢再出来。那些特务武装听见他们的名字，更是闻风丧胆。他们经常深入敌后，主动出击，前后活捉了××个特务奸霸，召开过四次大的群众集会，对据点敌人展开政治攻势，在敌据点附近张贴了布告和宣传品二百余张，致使敌人惊惶万状。
    连志中武工队的每个队员都知道：咱们都是老百姓，是为保卫人民利益而战，因此也到处受到群众拥护。在击退了嘴湾抢粮的敌人以后，群众便拿着鸡和鸡蛋等东西赶来送给武工队。群众感激地说道：“要没有老连他们，狗日（指敌）的三个也敢出来，咱这架山的粮食东西都给抢光了。”队员家属们看到自己的儿子受人拥护，都写信告自己的子弟说：“好好的跟老连同志干吧！”
    这支农民武装的巩固和坚强，是与连志中同志的领导分不开的。每逢战斗，他总是身先士卒，指挥队员们布好阵地，使武工队从未受过损失，因而队员们常对新来的队员说：“听老连的话，保险没差。”在淋漓的大雨中，志中同志和队员一样坚守山头，队员们感动的说：“老连都这样能吃苦，咱还不好好的干！？”背粮时，队员只扛十八斤，他却扛了卅九斤。第二次大家都自动多扛，最少的也背了四十斤。他又领导大家加紧练武，将这些没有战斗经验的农民，训练成勇敢善战的士兵。在战争空隙中，他亲自领导队员学习投弹、射击、埋地雷，并利用实例解说；在战场上又指挥大家利用地形；战斗结束后，就及时检讨，教育队员；在平时还进行读报讲解时事。在敌人进攻最疯狂的时候，有的队员认为“敌人这样多，怎么能坚持呀！？”志中同志就给队员算胜利账来打通思想，例如：修武县对敌斗争在几十天之内，毙伤蒋军三十多名，我们仅伤二名。使民兵对敌斗争的信心更加提高。
    他对队员生活也非常关心，并不怕麻烦地给他们解决实际问题。他常说：“不解决实际问题，光凭说话就打不通思想。”队员李经来衣服很单薄，他赶快先给李搞了一条棉裤；李代祥家里挨饿，他想法给他搞了几斗粮食；宰天喜病了，他亲自去招拂，宰天喜感动地说：“亲生父母也不过这样吧。”有一个队员没有请假回了家，回来后志中同志见了他没有批评，先问他家里安好，后问他家有啥困难？那个队员说：“粮食没有搬出来。”志中同志马上派了几个队员帮他搬粮食。这个队员很感动。这支日益壮大的农民武装，现已成为豫北蒋伪的心脏病。
