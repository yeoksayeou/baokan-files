[Report from the Jiluyu Front of this newspaper on the 2nd] The Catholic Church in Shan County was wantonly destroyed by Chiang's troops during their occupation. After the Eighth Route Army recovered Shan County on the 26th, the church has begun to rectify and restore itself. According to German Father Gv noski of the church, the church has been established for 43 years. The Eighth Route Army has twice liberated the city from the Japanese and Chiang's troops and has given special protection to the church. They are deeply grateful. During the Japanese occupation, church affairs were almost at a standstill. After the Eighth Route Army liberated Shan County for the first time, the church urgently sought to restore itself. However, as soon as the plan was completed, Shan County was occupied by Chiang's troops. The church's affiliated school and hospital were forcibly occupied by Chiang's troops as barracks, and all utensils were destroyed or moved away. Many nuns were occupied. Father Ge recounted the atrocities of Chiang's troops in destroying the church and was very indignant. Now, under the protection of the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government, the church is being rectified and restored. (Shen Rong, Fang De)

　　被蒋军摧残的天主教堂在民主政府保护下恢复
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】蒋军侵占单县期间，肆意摧残该城天主教堂。八路军于二十六日收复单县后，该堂已开始整顿恢复。据该堂德籍神父葛洛诺斯基（Gv noski）称：该教堂建立已四十三年，八路军由日本人及蒋军手中两度光复该城，对该堂备加保护，渠等深为感激。在日寇占领期间教务几陷停顿，八路军第一次解放单县后该堂亟谋恢复，但计划甫成，单县又被蒋军侵占，该堂附属学校及医院均被蒋军强占作为兵营，所有用具均被毁坏或搬走，修女多被霸占，葛神父历述蒋军摧残该堂暴行、不胜愤慨。现该堂在八路军与民主政府保护下正进行整顿恢复。（沈容、方德）
