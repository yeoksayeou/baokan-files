Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - Comprehensive reports from Tokyo: MacArthur Headquarters has abandoned the Potsdam Agreement and all pretense of democracy. On the 31st, it explicitly forbade the general strike scheduled for February 1st by government employees and public utility workers' unions. Earlier, at 8:00 PM on the 30th, American officials from MacArthur Headquarters summoned Japanese labor leaders to read out MacArthur's military order prohibiting the general strike. The labor leaders questioned the reasons for the prohibition, and the debate lasted for two hours. Finally, they requested a copy of MacArthur's order, but the American officials refused, only allowing the labor leaders to take notes on the order. The order threatened that if a general strike broke out, not only would the labor leaders be severely punished, but union members and strike instigators would also be punished, and the future Japanese labor movement would also be affected. The American officials gave the labor leaders until 2:00 AM on the 31st to submit a reply accepting the order. After leaving MacArthur Headquarters, the labor leaders declared that they had long anticipated that MacArthur Headquarters would directly prohibit the strike. They personally were not afraid of punishment, but this was a union decision and a meeting had to be held before a reply could be made. At 11:00 PM on the 30th, the Joint Struggle Committee, which was leading the general strike, met until dawn, without replying to MacArthur Headquarters. On the morning of the 31st, a spokesman for the Joint Struggle Committee told a United Press reporter that the committee's attitude was the same as its attitude towards the suggestions of senior officials at MacArthur Headquarters for the past week, and it would not abandon the general strike due to this "oral instruction." If a formal written order was received, it would be considered. At 2:30 PM, MacArthur Headquarters issued an order prohibiting the general strike. At 3:00 PM, officials from MacArthur Headquarters separately met with nine labor leaders, asking them why they had not replied to the "oral instruction" of the previous day. The chairman of the Joint Struggle Committee replied that officials from MacArthur Headquarters had not formally given them the order. Throughout the afternoon, thirteen union leaders were gathered at the Joint Struggle Committee headquarters, heavily guarded by the union's "Youth League," discussing a response. Japanese Communist Party leader Tokuda stepped into the headquarters at 4:45 PM to meet with the labor leaders. At 6:00 PM, American officials from MacArthur Headquarters again summoned the union leaders, asking them to each draft an order notifying their respective unions to abandon the strike plan. The union leaders requested time to consult with their unions, but the American officials refused to let them leave MacArthur Headquarters unless each of them issued an order to abandon the strike. The union leaders remained at MacArthur Headquarters until 10:00 PM on the 31st, without leaving. During this time, the chairman of the Joint Struggle Committee broadcast an order to abandon the general strike at 8:00 PM and announced the dissolution of the Joint Struggle Committee. In his statement, he pointed out that what was being abandoned was only the "general strike" referred to in MacArthur's order, and whether individual unions would still hold strikes would be decided by each union itself.

　　麦克阿瑟公开与人民为敌
    日本总罢工横遭阻止
    【新华社延安一日电】综合东京消息：麦克阿瑟总部已抛弃波茨顿协定以及一切民主的面具，于三十一日，明令禁止政府公务员及公用事业工人工会订于二月一日开始的总罢工。先是，卅日夜二十时，麦克阿瑟总部美官员召集日本劳工领袖宣读麦克阿瑟的军事命令，禁止举行总罢工。劳工领袖质问禁止的理由，辩论达两小时之久，最后要求将麦氏命令给他们一份，但美方官员不允，仅容许劳工领袖笔记该命令。该命令威胁：如总罢工爆发，则不仅重惩职工领袖，而且也要惩罚工会会员及罢工鼓动者，未来之日本工会运动亦将受影响。美方官员限各劳工领袖，于卅一日晨二时交出接受此命令之复文。劳工领袖于离开麦克阿瑟总部后宣称：他们许久以来即预料麦氏总部会直接禁止罢工，他们个人并不害怕惩罚，但这是工会的决定，必须举行会议然后始能作复。三十日夜十一时，领导此次总罢工之联合斗争委员会开会，直至清晨始散，未答复麦氏总部。三十一日上午，联合斗争委员会发言人告合众社记者称：委员会的态度和一周来对麦克阿瑟总部高级官员的建议的态度一样，亦不因此次“口头指令”而放弃总罢工。假如收到正式的书面命令，当加以考虑。下午二时半，麦氏总部发布禁止总罢工命令，三时麦氏总部官员分别接见九位劳工领袖，询问他们为何对昨日的“口头指令”不答复，联合斗争委员会主席曾答复称：麦克阿瑟总部官员并未将命令正式交给他们。整个下午，十三个工会领袖均齐集于由工会“青年团”警卫森严之联合斗争委员会总部中，讨论作答。日共领袖德田于四时四十五分步入该总部与各劳工领袖晤谈，下午六时麦氏总部美官员再次召集各工会领袖，要他们各自起草通知各工会放弃罢工计划的命令。各工会领袖要求给予时间，以便和他们的工会商谈，但美方官员拒绝他们离开麦克阿瑟总部，除非每人都发出放弃罢工的命令。各工会领袖一直坐在麦克阿瑟总部那里，直至三十一日夜十时尚未离开，在此期间，联合斗争委员会主席于八时广播关于放弃总罢工的命令，并宣布解散联合斗争委员会。他在声明中指出：放弃者仅为麦克阿瑟命令中所指的“总罢工”，而各个别工会是否仍举行罢工，则各自决定。
