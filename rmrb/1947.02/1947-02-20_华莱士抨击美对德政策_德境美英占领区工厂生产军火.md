　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: Agence France-Presse, Bratislava, February 14th: Wallace, in an interview with the New York correspondent of the Slovakian weekly "Roľnícke Noviny", stated that relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union today are not as tense as they were in the summer of 1946. Regarding U.S. policy toward Germany, he emphasized that some U.S. representatives stationed in European countries tend to cooperate with the most reactionary elements. Wallace advocated that the Ruhr be placed under international joint management, and that the rest of Germany should become a free federation.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: TASS reports: Katalev, in an article in "Stalin's Eagle" newspaper, stated: In western and southwestern Germany, there are still a large number of aviation research and experimental centers (such as the Aerodynamics Institute in Schleswig, Dortmund, Hanover, etc.). Foreign newspapers indicate that the more than 3,000 workers recruited at the "Blohm & Voss" aircraft factory in Hamburg are forced to sign pledges not to disclose the nature of the factory's products. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to believe that they will produce civilian consumer goods. The manufacture of diesel engines for V-2 rockets has resumed at the Maer factory near Stuttgart. Some factories in Württemberg have begun manufacturing electrical equipment for rocket aircraft. These facts prove that certain British and American groups have not abandoned the hope of burying the Potsdam decisions.

　　华莱士抨击美对德政策
    德境美英占领区工厂生产军火
    【新华社延安十七日电】据法新闻社布拉的拉发十四日电：华莱士在接见斯洛伐克“络维斯拉沃”周刊驻纽约记者时称，今天美苏之间的关系，不如一九四六年夏天那么紧张。关于美国对德政策，他强调指出美国有些驻欧洲各国代表，有与最反动分子合作之倾向。华氏主张鲁尔交由国际共管，德国其他部分应成一个自由联邦。
    【新华社延安十七日电】塔斯社讯：卡塔利夫顷在“斯大林之鹰”报上著文称：德国西部与西南部，仍有大量的航空研究与实验中心（例如石勒瑟克、多特蒙德、汉诺威等地之气体力学学院）。外国报纸显示在汉堡“布洛姆洛斯”飞机工厂招用之三千余工人，被迫具结不泄露工厂出品的性质。在此情形下，使人很难相信它们会出产民用消费品。法尼式飞弹所用第塞尔引擎的制造，已于斯图加特附近的马尔工厂恢复。武登堡的某些工厂，已开始制造火箭飞机所用的电气装备，这些事实证明英美某些集团，尚未放弃将波茨顿决定埋葬的希望。
