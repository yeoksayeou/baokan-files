　　UK Coal Shortage Remains Severe
    But Rejects US Aid
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: London dispatch: Fuel Minister Shinwell announced on the 14th that the fuel situation in the UK remains very serious, and we are still far from a victorious resolution of the crisis. However, the government seems to have no need to accept coal shipments from the United States to overcome the crisis (note: US President Truman declared on the 13th that the US government is prepared to do everything in its power to alleviate the UK's fuel crisis, and if the UK requests it, the US can divert coal ships initially destined for Europe to the UK).

　　英国煤荒仍严重
    但拒绝美国接济
    【新华社延安十六日电】伦敦讯：燃料部长辛威尔于十四日宣布，英国燃料情况仍很严重，现在距离危机之胜利解决还很远。但政府似乎无须接受美国运煤来克服危机（按：美总统杜鲁门于十三日曾宣称，美政府准备尽其力之所及，以救济英国燃料危机，如果英国要求，美即可将首途赴欧之煤船调往英国。）
