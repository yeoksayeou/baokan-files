[This dispatch from the front lines of the JiluYu area] Our reporter met Zhang Ziyi, regimental commander of the 242nd Regiment of the 81st Brigade of the Northwest Army, and Yang Zhensheng, deputy regimental commander of the 543rd Regiment of the 181st Brigade, who laid down their weapons in the Dingtao outer defense battles, in a certain location on the front lines. Commander Zhang's right hand and left arm had been disabled in previous battles. Commander Zhang had repeatedly requested to retire from the Chiang army authorities because of this, but was stubbornly refused. He said that the morale of the Chiang army is now extremely low. When the unit departed from Heze this time, they encountered a large number of Chiang army soldiers from the 3rd Reorganized Division and the 119th Brigade who had been captured and released by the Eighth Route Army. They held certificates and travel expenses from the democratic government and described the preferential treatment of prisoners by the Eighth Route Army. Commander Zhang said, "The soldiers were prepared to surrender their guns from the beginning." Commander Yang said, "This time we were sent east to have our Northwest Army reinforce Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 21st Brigade, which was surrounded in Jinxiang. But when we were surrounded, Chiang Kai-shek never sent a single person or gun to reinforce us. In the end, it was still our irregular troops who were wiped out."

[This dispatch from the front lines of the JiluYu area on the 30th] Zhu Qingchuan, senior advisor to the puppet army Zhang Lanfeng's unit, Wei Xizhou, chief of the staff office, and Song Junshan, commander of the 3rd Regiment, who laid down their weapons between Jinxiang and Chengwu, arrived at the JiluYu Front Line Headquarters a few days ago. Advisor Zhu said, "The higher-ups don't dare to tell the truth to the irregular troops. We are at their disposal." Commander Song said at the time of departure: "They want to smash us, an egg, against a rock." They said that the Chiang army had underestimated the Eighth Route Army in the past, but now they have contracted "Eighth Route Army phobia." Wei Xizhou, the former deputy division commander of Zhang Lanfeng's 17th Division and current chief of the staff office, said that under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of eliminating irregular troops, Zhang's unit, which used to have a total of 36 regiments, has now been reorganized into only 6 regiments. Before the Longhai Campaign, the Chiang army delayed providing supplies to Zhang's unit. At the beginning of the Longhai Campaign, in order to use them to fight the civil war, they hurriedly sent planes to deliver grain and money. He said: "The fate of the irregular troops is: if they win a battle, they will be reorganized when they return; if they lose a battle, they will become cannon fodder. We can survive because of the Eighth Route Army. Now, the 'big irregular army' (referring to the Eighth Route Army) has become a shelter for the small irregular armies." They are also extremely dissatisfied with the tyranny of the Chiang regime and the atrocities of the US military. Advisor Zhu said humorously: "The Republic of China has never lived up to its name. In the past, it was the Republic of the Military, and now it is the Republic of America."

　　定陶等地放下武器军官谈
    杂牌军要找出路只有投奔八路军
    【本报冀鲁豫前线一日电】记者在线前某地会见定陶外围战斗中放下武器的西北军八十一旅二四二团团长张子仪、一八一旅五四三团副团长杨振声等。张团长右手及左臂均已在过去战斗中先后残废，张团长曾因此一再向蒋军当局恳求退伍，终遭蛮横拒绝。他说，现在蒋军士气极为低落，该部此次由荷泽出发时，沿途遇到大批被八路军俘虏后又放回之整三师和一一九旅的蒋军士兵，他们持有民主政府的证明文件及路费，并叙述八路军优待俘虏的情形。张团长说：“出发时士兵们早就做了缴枪的准备。”杨团长说：“此次东进是叫我们西北军增援被围在金乡的蒋介石嫡系二十一旅，而当我们被包围时，蒋介石始终未派一人一枪来增援，结果被消灭的还是我们杂牌军。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十日电】在金乡城武间放下武器的伪军张岚峰部高级参议祝晴川、参谋处长魏西周、第三团团长宋俊三于日前到达冀鲁豫前线指挥部。祝参议说：“上峰不敢把真实情况说给杂牌，我们是任其摆布。”宋团长在出发时即曾说：“要拿我们这个鸡蛋向石头上摔。”他们说蒋军过去对八路军估计过低，现在却得了“恐八病”。原任张岚峰部第十七师副师长现任参谋处长的魏西周说，在蒋介石消灭杂牌的政策下，过去张部共三十六个团，现在仅编剩六个团，陇海战役前蒋军拖延对张部之供给，陇海战役开始，为了利用他们打内战，即赶派飞机送粮送款。他说：“杂牌的命运是：打了胜仗回去要给编完，打败仗就当了炮灰；我们能生存，是因为有八路军。现在，‘大杂牌’（指八路军）成了小杂牌的收容所。”他们对蒋政权的暴政及美军的暴行也极为不满，祝参议幽默的说：“中华民国从来没有名符其实，过去是中华军国，现在是中华美国。”
