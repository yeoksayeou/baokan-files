　　Turned-Over Citizens Raise Funds to Run Their Own School
    Xingtai Public School Officially Opens
    Adopting a "Teaching, Doing, Combining" Approach to Strive for Student Self-Sufficiency
    [Our Newspaper] The first secondary vocational school in the Border Region founded by the turned-over masses themselves, the Xingtai Citizen-Run Xingtai Public School, has been officially established. After the 50,000 citizens of Xingtai completely turned themselves over, their economic conditions have generally improved. Therefore, everyone hopes that their children can go to school and unanimously requested to establish a vocational school funded by themselves that truly serves everyone, where they can learn both culture and a set of production skills, and where students can also be self-sufficient. After discussions among the masses in various streets, it was decided to establish the Citizen-Run Xingtai Public School. In addition to issuing all the real estate and furniture of the original Yide Middle School as the school's buildings and furniture, 3 million yuan in cash and 1.2 million yuan worth of materials were drawn from the fruits of the citywide struggle as the school's production fund. It was further proposed that a machine for manufacturing the fruits of the struggle, three sewing machines, several knitting machines for socks, fabrics, and towels, as well as hundreds of wooden boards, sixteen mu of vegetable garden and vineyard, and a soap-making machine be used as tools for the school's students to carry out vocational education and self-sufficiency in the future. At the same time, Zhao Guoquan, chairman of the Salvation Association, was unanimously elected by everyone as the chairman and principal of the school, and the board of directors was jointly composed of representatives of the masses. Regarding the future admission of students to the school, the main focus is on the turned-over masses and cadres. The school's educational policy is determined to adopt the principle of "teaching, doing, combining" and part-work, part-study, with vocational education (i.e., production) and cultural learning each accounting for half of the time, with cultural learning in the morning and production in the afternoon. In terms of vocational education: based on the existing production tools, sewing, knitting, weaving, towel weaving, soap making, carpentry, winemaking, cigarette rolling, and agricultural groups will be established first. Each student can freely choose to participate in one, and it is planned that each student will be required to learn at least two production skills upon graduation. The school's future funding, in addition to the municipal government subsidizing the supply of ten faculty members, will be entirely solved by the school's own production. The students' living expenses will also be entirely solved through production. All vocational education products will fully implement a 20/80 profit-sharing system, with the school only collecting 20% for the wear and tear of production tools and using it to subsidize office expenses. In addition, in order to better take care of the students' lives, the school has specially allocated three mu of vegetable land for students to plant. All the vegetables produced, in addition to being used for students' consumption, the remaining proceeds from sales will all supplement the students' oil, salt, and other food expenses. In order to enable students to learn other vocational skills and solve part of the students' living expenses, they have also adopted the method of students concurrently serving as staff members. Currently, the school's accountant, clerk, doorman, etc. are all fully staffed by students. With the enthusiastic preparation of the masses in the city and the active efforts of the school staff, the school was prepared around the Lantern Festival in the old lunar calendar and officially established. In addition to the more than seventy students from the original Yide Middle School who have come to the school, new students have also begun to be enrolled, with a planned total enrollment of forty new students and forty transfer students. The masses all know that Xingtai Public School has become their own school, and that they can study without spending much money or even without spending any money, so everyone is enthusiastically sending their children to school.

    采取教学做合一方针争取学员生产自给
    【本报讯】边区第一个由翻身群众自己筹资创办的中等职业学校——邢台市民立邢台公学，业已正式成立。邢台市五万市民彻底翻身以后，经济状况普遍上升。因此，大家都希望他们的儿女能够上学，一致要求由自己筹资创办一个真正为大家服务，既能学习文化又能学会一套生产技术，并且学生也能生产自给的职业学校。经过各街群众的讨论，决定成立民立邢台公学。除发出原义德中学全部房产及家具，作为公学的校舍及家具外，并从全市斗争果实中，抽出现款三百万元，及价值一百二十万元的物资，作为该校生产基金；更提出斗争果实制造机器一部、缝衣机三架，织袜、织布、织手巾机各数部，以及木板数百块、菜园地和葡萄园共十六亩，制肥皂机器一部等，作为该校学生今后进行职业教育与生产自给的工具。同时，并由大家一致推举救联会主席赵国权同志为该校董事长兼校长，董事会则由群众代表联合组成。关于该校今后吸收学生的对象，主要的放在翻身群众及干部方面。公学的教育方针，决定采用“教学做合一”，和半工半读的原则，职业教育（也就是生产）与文化学习各占一半，上半天为文化学习，下半天则从事生产。在职业教育方面：根据现有的生产工具，先设立缝衣、织袜、织布、织手巾、制肥皂、木工、造酒、卷烟及农业组，每个学生可以自由选择参加一种，计划每个学生毕业时，至少要求学会两种以上的生产技术。该校今后的经费，除由市政府补助十个教职员的供给外，全部由该校自己生产解决。学生的生活费用，也全由生产来解决，所有一切职业教育的生产品，完全实行二八分红制，校方只收二成生产工具的消毫，并用以补助办公开支。另外，校方为了更好的照顾学生的生活，特别拨出菜地三亩给学生种植，所有生产的蔬菜除供学生吃用外，剩余出卖的款项，全部补充学生的油盐等菜金的消耗。为了使学生能学会其他的职业技术，更多的解决一部分学生的生活起见，他们并采用了学生兼任职员的办法，现该校的会计、文书、门房等均完全由学生担任。该校在全市群众的热烈筹备，及校方人员的积极动手下，已于旧历元宵节前后筹备就绪，正式成立。现除原义德中学学生已有七十余名来校外，新生也已开始招收，预定共招新生四十名，插班生四十名。群众都知道邢台公学已经成为他们自己的学校了，而且，不用花多少钱甚至可以不花钱就可住学，大家都踊跃的送他们的子弟来上学。（西民）
