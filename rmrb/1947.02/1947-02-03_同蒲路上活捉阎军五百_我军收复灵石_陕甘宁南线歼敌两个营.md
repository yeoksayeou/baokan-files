　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 1st] The Taiyue Eighth Route Army recovered Lingshi County, a town on the Tongpu Railway, on the 30th of last month, capturing over 500 Yan's army security regiment members, including the deputy commander. The city was occupied by Yan's army on October 10th of last year.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the 368th Regiment of the 212th Brigade of Hu Zongnan's troops invaded Liangjia Village on the border of the Guanzhong District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, coming from Tongfuzhen, Chunhua County. The local army and civilians bravely fought back, and after fierce fighting until 4:00 PM, all two invading battalions (missing one company) were annihilated. The report says that the affiliated mortar company, the heavy artillery company of the First War Zone Command, the search platoon, and the medical team were wiped out, killing or wounding over 900 invading soldiers, and capturing more than 20 artillery pieces of various types.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, 1st] One hour after the liberation of Ding County, this reporter rushed into the city and saw that order had been established, shops were open, and every household was tidying up their houses and courtyards, preparing to settle down. Some residents even enthusiastically assisted the People's Liberation Army in cleaning the battlefield and repairing the city. The proclamation of the city defense headquarters established by the Eighth Route Army was posted on various main roads, strictly declaring three things: (1) Protect the safety of all churches and protect freedom of religion. (2) Protect cultural and educational institutions and their construction. (3) Protect private industry and commerce. Ding County is located 120 miles south of Baoding, with a population of 40,000, and is an important town in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. From 1925 to 1937, the China Association for Mass Education, headed by Y. C. James Yen, established an experimental zone in the city and its surrounding villages and towns.
