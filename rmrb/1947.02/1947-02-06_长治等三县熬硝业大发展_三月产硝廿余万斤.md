    【Taixing News, 30th】In order to supply the self-defense war, the saltpeter boiling industry in Lucheng, Licheng and Changzhi counties has greatly developed during the winter production. In the three months before the Lunar New Year, the three counties produced 245,000 jin of saltpeter, with a total value of 83.3 million yuan, completing 71% of the original plan. The saltpeter boiling industry in these three counties was not well developed in the past. Only Licheng and Lucheng counties had very few saltpeter workshops. Now, there are 195 saltpeter workshops in the three counties, most of which were developed during the winter production of the past two years. Last winter, there were only 114 saltpeter boiling technicians in the three counties, but now there are 330. More than 1,000 people are engaged in saltpeter boiling. The rapid development is largely due to the government's attention to promoting it. Zhao, the county head of Lucheng, and the head of the first district personally organized the masses to boil saltpeter, so the county's achievements are also the greatest, and it has now become the main saltpeter producing area in the Shangdang district. The Construction Section of the Changzhi Third Administrative Office held a saltpeter industry conference of three counties before the Lunar New Year to summarize experience and transform winter production saltpeter workshops into year-round operations. At present, there are two types of saltpeter workshop operation: one is small-scale cooperative, such as the Chen Zilei Saltpeter Workshop in Dongguan, Lucheng, which is established by workers using their own labor, technology, and tools as shares. When distributing dividends, tools account for 15%, 5% is used as a bonus for ash (saltpeter raw material) households, and the remaining is distributed according to technical level and labor strength. The other is preparation and operation, such as the Zhang Haibao Saltpeter Workshop in Dongguan, Licheng, where Zhang himself is a skilled technician, and other workers and apprentices only get wages. The meeting believed that the operating method and dividend distribution method of Chen Zilei Saltpeter Workshop should be vigorously promoted, but the employment operation should not be forced to change. The meeting held a respect-teachers campaign to improve technology and raised the original plan for the three counties to produce 346,000 jin of saltpeter before the spring plowing to 420,000 jin.

    长治等三县熬硝业大发展
    三月产硝廿余万斤
    【本报太行三十日电】为供应自卫战争，冬季生产中潞城、黎城、长治三县熬硝业有极大的发展。旧历年前三个月，三县已产硝二十四万五千斤，总值八千三百三十万元。完成原数计划百分之七十一。三县熬硝业过去本不发达，仅黎、潞两县有极少硝坊，现在三县共有一百九十五座硝坊，绝大部分是去、今两年冬季生产中发展起来的。去冬三县熬硝技工不过一百十四人，现已有三百三十人。从事熬硝者则达千余人。发展的迅速与政府注意推动关系甚大，潞城赵县长及一区长均曾亲自组织群众熬硝，故该县成绩亦最大，现已成为上党区的主要产硝地，长治三专署建设科特于旧历年前召开三县熬硝业会议，总结经验，并使冬季生产性质的硝坊转为常年经营。目前硝坊经营方式有两种：一为小型合作性质，如潞城东关陈子垒硝坊系由工人以自己劳力，技术与工具作股开办，分红时工具占百分之十五，以百分之五作积灰（熬硝原料）户的奖金，余按技术高低，劳力强弱评分分红。一为筹备经营，如黎城东关张海保硝坊，张本人为一熟练技工，其他工人学徒只得工资。该会认为陈子垒硝坊的经营方式与分红办法应大力提倡，但雇佣经营亦不硬使改变。该会前召开展敬师运动，提高技术。并将原计划春耕前三县产硝三十四万六千斤，提高为四十二万斤。
