　　"Chairman Mao is even closer than my own father!"
　　·Shao Ziqiang·
　　Niu Chunyuan was born in Guyi Village, Fifth District of Lucheng. He lost his parents at the age of eight and was a poor orphan. He herded cattle and sheep for others until he was eighteen, and then worked as a long-term laborer for others for a full seventeen years.

　　After the Japanese invaders occupied Lucheng, Guyi became a "maintained village." In 1942, the anti-Japanese village chief Li Shuangzhi thought that Chunyuan was reliable and asked him to send intelligence to our anti-Japanese government. The special agent landlord suspected him and reported him to Ma Zhiliang, the puppet district chief, who arrested him and took him to the puppet district office. He was forced to ask: "Who is your backstage supporter?" Chunyuan thought: "I just saw the light of day, and these bad guys caught me. If I expose myself, I will die anyway, and it will also implicate Li Shuangzhi and other anti-Japanese cadres. I can't say it, I can only die. If I die, they will know how I died! They will definitely avenge me!"

　　He didn't say anything. The puppet district chief got angry and put him on the press bar. First, six people were used to clamp him. Chunyuan gritted his teeth and didn't say a word. He was pressed four times in a row. Finally, sixteen people pressed him. Chunyuan was in so much pain that he fainted three times, but when he regained consciousness, he still firmly said: "Even if you execute me, I have no backstage supporter!" The puppet district chief had no choice but to release him.

　　Chunyuan returned and continued to do underground anti-Japanese work, organizing six young people in the village to form an anti-Japanese armed group.

　　The enemy surrendered the year before last. Chunyuan led all the poor farmers in Guyi Village to settle blood debts with traitors, evil landlords, and special agents. The slogan he put forward was: "The emancipation must be thorough, the struggle must be thorough, and the complaints must be thorough!" Under his leadership, the masses in the whole village took action and killed the village's landlord bullies - Yan Dafu, Liu Zuohan and Hu Hongyou.

　　His brother-in-law, Bao Haifang, was afraid of the mass struggle and hid two parcels in his house. He took these two parcels to the village headquarters and said: "Anyone who is the target of struggle, I won't even recognize if they are my parents."

　　Last year, after leveling and making up the land, more than sixty poor peasant households in the whole village received land. Everyone agreed that Niu Chunyuan had made great contributions, so they elected him as the chairman of the trade union.

　　Now Chunyuan has three houses, twenty-six mu of land, and he has also married a wife. The family of three is living a happy life.

　　After the emancipation, he completely tore down the idols and hung a large portrait of Chairman Mao in the middle of the house. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, Chunyuan got up early in the morning and first paid New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao. His wife, lying in bed, said, "It's New Year's Day, I want to pay New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao." Trembling, she climbed out of bed and kowtowed three times to Chairman Mao. She said, "Chairman Mao is even closer than my own parents!"

　　“毛主席比俺爹还亲哩！”
    ·邵自强·
    牛春元生在潞城五区古驿村，八岁时就死了父母，是一个贫苦的孤儿。给人家拦牛羊，一直拦到十八岁，又给人当长工，整整当了十七年。
    日寇侵占潞城后，古驿成了“维持村”，四二年抗日村长李双枝，认为春元办事可靠，就要他给咱抗日政府送情报。特务地主对他怀疑，向伪区长马治良报告，把他抓到伪区署。逼问：“谁给你作后台？”春元想：“我刚见了青天，就让这些坏家伙抓住，我要暴露了，也是一死，还连累了李双枝和别的抗日干部。我不能说，只能死了，我死了他们知道了我是怎样死的！一定会给我报仇！”
    他不说，伪区长起了贼火，把他上了压杆，先用六个人夹压他，春元咬紧牙关一声不吭，一连压了四次，最后用十六个人压，春元痛得昏迷过去三次，返省过来还是斩钉切铁的说：“你枪决了我也没有后台！”伪区长没有办法，只好把他放了。
    春元回来，继续作抗日地下工作，组织村里六个青年，成立抗日武装小组。
    前年敌人投降了，春元就在古驿村领导全村的贫苦农民，向汉奸恶霸地主特务清算血债，他提出的口号是：“翻身要翻透，斗争要斗透，诉苦要诉透！”在他的领导下，全村群众行动起来，打死了村中地主恶霸——阎大福、刘左汉和胡鸿有。
    他姐夫包海方，害怕群众斗争，将包裹两个藏到他家，他就拿了这两个包裹送到村指挥部，并说：“凡是斗争对象，就是爹娘都不认。”
    去年填平补齐，全村贫苦农民六十多户得到土地，大家一致认为，牛春元的功劳大。就选他当工会主席。
    现在春元有房三间，地二十六亩，还娶了个老婆，一家三口过着幸福的日子。
    翻身后，他把神像完全撕掉，把毛主席的大像挂在屋子的中间，大年初一，春元早晨起来就先给毛主席拜年。他女人在病床上躺着说“新年大节，我要给毛主席拜年。”颤抖着从病床上爬下，给毛主席磕了三个头，她说：“毛主席比俺爹娘还亲哩！”
