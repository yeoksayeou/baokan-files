Huangshan Cadres Specific Division of Labor
Resolve the contradiction between work and production
[Reported by this newspaper] After arranging winter production, the cadres in Huangshan Village, Huguan, felt that they couldn't engage in production themselves while doing work. Therefore, some were unhappy and said, "Serving the masses means neglecting oneself." Later, after joint research, the following methods were devised: 1. Cadres pool shares for transportation. This time, eight cadres in Huangshan pooled shares to buy six loads of goods, assigned someone to transport them, and then divided the profits (according to the shares, those who went out ate from the collective, and the profit distribution was the same). 2. After the transportation cadres left, all the work in the village was the responsibility of the cadres at home. 3. In addition to their work during the day, the cadres at home went down to the kiln at night, earning fifteen catties of rice every day. Some participated in workshops. As a result, the cadres were all happy, and the cadres at home also worked very hard. Their competition condition was "Those who go out should earn money, and those who stay at home should do their work well." As a result of this win-win situation, the mass winter production campaign in the village was enthusiastically launched under the active leadership of the cadres. (Huangshan Correspondent Group)

    黄山干部具体分工
    解决工作生产矛盾
    【本报讯】壶关黄山村干部，在布置冬季生产以后，都觉得做工作，自己就不能生产，因此有的就不高兴，说：“给群众服务就不能说自己”，后来经过共同研究得出以下办法：一、干部集股运输，这次黄山八个干部集股买了六担货，抽出人去运输，回来大家分红，（按股金分，出外的吃大伙的，分红一样）。二、运输干部走后村上一切工作由在家干部负责。三、在家干部白天除工作外，黑夜下窑，每天能赚十五斤米，有的参加了作坊。这样一来，干部们都高兴了，在家干部也很努力工作，他们的竞赛条件是“出外的要赚钱，在家的要把工作做好。”公私两利的结果，该村群众性的冬季生产运动在干部积极带头下热烈开展了。（黄山通讯小组）
