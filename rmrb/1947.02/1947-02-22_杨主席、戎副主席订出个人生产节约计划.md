　　Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong Set Personal Production and Savings Plan
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government have formulated their 1947 production and savings plan, and Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong jointly announced it at the Border Region Production Mobilization Conference: (1) In terms of production: 1. Dedicate one hour each day, using a "sparrow warfare" method, to grow vegetables in the stationed village, and all vegetable production will be handed over to the public. 2. Exchange labor with guards or orderlies to participate in agricultural production teams organized by the government, completing production tasks democratically discussed and decided upon. 3. Learn to knit socks and gloves, striving for self-sufficiency in woolen goods (Chairman Yang did not set this third item). (2) Savings Items: 1. Except for subsidies and the necessary two pairs of shoes, all other supplies to be received will be saved. 2. Use waste paper as much as possible. 3. Strive to use envelopes four times. 4. Strive not to use matches during the heating season. 5. Avoid using foreign paper unless absolutely necessary. Chairman Yang stated that this plan was formulated based on personal needs and work requirements, and he would resolutely complete it. In addition to this, Chairman Yang said that he would also hand over manuscript fees as a task. Vice Chairman Rong said, "Chairman Yang is a few years older than me, and he still strives for production. I have been farming since I was a child, so it is even less of a problem for me."
