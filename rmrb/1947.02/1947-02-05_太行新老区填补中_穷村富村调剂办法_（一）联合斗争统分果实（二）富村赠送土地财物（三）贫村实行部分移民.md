　　Taihang New and Old Areas Filling the Gap
    Methods for Adjusting Between Poor and Rich Villages
    (1) Joint Struggle to Unify and Distribute Fruits (2) Rich Villages Donate Land and Property (3) Poor Villages Implement Partial Immigration
    [Our Newspaper Taihang Dispatch, 31st:] In the Taihang new and old areas' movement to fill the gap, the following adjustment methods have been adopted for particularly impoverished villages that cannot be leveled out even after thoroughly liquidating landlords: (1) Carry out joint struggles, and distribute the fruits uniformly. In Houjia Village, Lingchuan, there are five natural villages, three relatively wealthy and two relatively poor. After carrying out a joint struggle among the five villages, distribution was based on villages, setting standard scores, distributing by village first, and then distributing to the masses. Last December, Xingtai City jointly struggled against the top ten local bullies in Yangshi Street with poor villages such as Nanbei Wacao, Nanyuan, and Shenjiazhuang. Ninety percent of the fruits of the struggle were distributed to poor villages. (2) Help each other, with rich villages donating to poor villages. In Tongtan Town, Zuoquan, after overthrowing local bullies, when distributing the fruits, it was proposed, "The landlords in our village did not only exploit our own village to become rich. Zhongzhuang, Xiawu, and Wujiaqi were also impoverished by their exploitation. Let the poor brothers in the poor villages also turn themselves over." Everyone agreed that in addition to distributing the landlords' land and houses in the three villages to those three villages, they also donated 500,000 yuan to Xiawu Village and 200,000 yuan to Zhongzhuang Village. Beiquangou, Yushe, sent 50 mu of land, 10 shi of grain, 320,000 yuan, and more than 100 pieces of clothing to Zhaigou, filling the holes of more than 20 poor households. After universal class education in Pingshun, more than ten villages such as Lujiakou, Chongyan, and Heihu gave up 34 mu of land and 194 shi of grain. The poorest villages, such as Beiliutan, Caozhuanggou, and Changgou, all received subsidies. Guangdai Village in the Fifth District also left 60 mu of good land, preparing for immigrants to settle down. The Civilian Association of Six Streets in Wuan City used the fruits of the struggle, worth one million yuan, to send them to the First District of Beiguan, entrusting them to be forwarded to the street with the most poor brothers. (3) Implement partial immigration. For example, poor villages in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Licheng are immigrating to the wealthier villages in the first, second, and third districts. Currently, 105 poor people and tenant farmers, as well as 16 honorably retired soldiers, have moved, and they have been properly settled. More than 30 households have moved from poor villages to Shuicun, Xingtai, and have also settled down.

　　太行新老区填补中
    穷村富村调剂办法
    （一）联合斗争统分果实（二）富村赠送土地财物（三）贫村实行部分移民
    【本报太行三十一日电：】太行新老区填补运动中，对于特别贫困村庄在彻底清算地主后仍填不平的，采取了以下几个调剂办法：（一）进行联合斗争，果实统一分配。陵川侯家庄村五个自然村，三个较富裕，二个村较穷，进行五村联合斗争后，分配时，以村为单位，订标准分，先以村分，再分给群众。邢台市去年十二月联合南北瓦窑、南园、沉家庄等穷村斗争羊市街十大恶霸，百分之九十的斗争果实，分给了穷村。（二）互相帮助，富村赠送贫村。左权桐滩镇，斗倒恶霸后，在分配果实时，即提出“咱村的地主，不是光剥削本村富了的，中庄、下武、武家岐，也是他剥削穷的，叫穷村穷兄弟们也翻翻身吧”。大家都同意，除将地主在该三村的土地房屋分归该三村外，并赠送下武村五十万元，中庄二十万元。榆社北泉沟送给寨沟土地五十亩，粮十石，款三十二万元，衣物百余件，填平了二十余家窟窿户，平顺经过普遍的阶级教育，路家口、崇岩、黑虎等十余村，让出土地三十四亩，粮食一百九十四石，最穷的北流滩、草庄沟、长沟等村均得到填补。五区广代村，还留下好地六十亩，准备移民来安家。武安城六街贫民会，以价值百万元的斗争果实，抬送北关一区。托其转送穷弟兄最多的街。（三）实行部分移民，如黎城四、五、六区的穷村，移民于一、二、三区较富的村庄，现已有贫民及客民一百零五户及荣退军人十六户移走，并已安置妥当。邢台水村，由穷村移来三十多户，亦已安家。
