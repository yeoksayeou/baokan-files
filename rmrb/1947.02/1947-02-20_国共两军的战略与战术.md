The war, pitting two million against one and a half million, has become the largest civil war in history. The war has continued for six months in ten provinces. After approximately 500,000 casualties, the strategies of both sides have become clear.

Exchanging Cities for Armies

The Kuomintang focuses on capturing Communist cities, while the Communists focus on capturing Kuomintang armies.

Chiang has captured 183 Communist cities, and the Communists have recovered more than 50, but Chiang still has a net gain of 130. (Note: This is the figure at the end of last year. According to figures released by the Yan'an headquarters on February 7, Chiang captured a total of 199 cities from July to January, and we recovered 100 cities, so Chiang only temporarily occupied 99 cities. —Editor) These cities include the border region capitals of Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Huaiyin, as well as all of northern Jiangsu except for one. However, some of these were recovered by the Communists last week. Chiang's army cleared the Central Plains Liberated Area north of Hankou, while the Central Plains Communist Army crossed about a hundred villages and towns, large and small, and advanced to the area south of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

No Communist seems discouraged. If Chiang Kai-shek can exaggerate his victories, so can they, and they believe their victories are more important. They are constantly annihilating Chiang's armies, claiming to have eliminated 500,000 of Chiang's troops, and not through cruel massacres, but by capturing them alive and converting them to their side.

Transportation Lines and the Countryside

It is surprising that two such different strategies can meet on the battlefield. Chiang, with his superior weapons and manpower, attempts to control North China by opening railway lines and capturing strategic strongholds. The Communist army, however, carries the rails into the mountains and focuses on "land reform." Thus, the strategic cities occupied by Chiang inevitably become isolated strongholds, surrounded by the countryside ruled by the Communists.

Battles occur frequently. The Communists lose cities, but they do not suffer defeats. They cannot afford to lose. Chiang has ammunition to expend. The Communists do not. They must make each battle profitable in terms of manpower and weapons. Therefore, they do not fight for cities, at least not now. Their soldiers calmly say, "This is not our strategy."

When large Kuomintang armies approach a city, the Communist army withdraws. "Let them in, we go to the mountains!" (Note: We don't necessarily go to the mountains. According to Commander Liu, we advance and retreat in large strides. —Editor) a Communist officer said.

Sooner or later, often very quickly, these mountain watchmen see an opportunity to ambush Chiang's army—four brigades! All become fish in their net. They use overwhelming force to surround and "annihilate" them.

More Prisoners Than Killed

Their army captures more than it kills. Of course, there are casualties in battle, and it is said that casualties account for 20 percent of those surrounded, but most are captured along with their weapons. A week later, they are fighting on the Communist side.

A staff officer of the Communist army in southwestern Shanxi, General Jiang, told me an example of this tactic. Here, five Kuomintang brigades were "annihilated" in five months, thus increasing their strength by 20 percent. At the beginning, the troops retreated without a fight, allowing Chiang Kai-shek's forces under Hu Zongnan to occupy a series of cities along the railway line. The Communist army dismantled the rails beforehand.

The Communist army spread "intelligence" to Hu Zongnan, saying that their main force was somewhere about 60 miles away. Hu mobilized three brigades and concentrated them in that area. The Communist main force was actually only fifteen miles away from the headquarters, and rushed down to surround one of the brigades, crushing it in a day and night of fighting. At the same time, the remaining two brigades were held back by small battles fought by local guerrillas.

The result was that one brigade was "annihilated." The Communist army increased by 5,700 men and a large amount of American weapons in a few days. This brigade was originally one of Chiang Kai-shek's elite units.

In theory, Chiang's officers should have quickly learned how to deal with this tactic. But this tactic continues to work time and time again. The Communists say: It took the Japanese eight years to finally learn the CCP's tactics. They accuse Chiang of keeping former Japanese commander in China, Yasuji Okamura, in Nanjing as an advisor, teaching him how to fight the civil war. The Communist Party considers this very important. "But that won't help him, we have invented new tactics to deal with Chiang."

The Results of the Past Year

At this moment, the radio is reporting the results of the past six months from various battlefields to Yan'an. The record of "annihilated brigades" looks like a world series record to Americans. But every child understands that this means that even if Yan'an is occupied, it doesn't matter.

General Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army in Shandong, reported: In 500 battles, Chiang's army suffered 50,399 casualties and 71,550 were captured. General Lin Biao telegraphed from Harbin: In 1,826 battles in Northeast China in 1946, Chiang's army lost 146,460 men. General Liu Bocheng on the Longhai Railway reported: In 3,823 battles, of the 49 brigades of Chiang's invading forces, nearly 18 brigades have been annihilated—68,093 casualties and 94,503 captured. (Note: In January, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region eliminated more than 60,000 Kuomintang troops and recovered 19 cities. —Editor)

Liu told reporters in Yan'an in November: "I exchanged 17 empty cities for 140,000 of Chiang's troops. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek thinks this is a good deal and wants to continue doing it, I have no problem." (Note: The original words were: "Okay, let him continue, the final account will be calculated in the near future." See this newspaper, November 20. —Editor)

The Communist Party claims that it annihilated 463,000 of Chiang's troops in 1946. In the first week of 1947, they surrounded three and a half brigades of Chiang's army near Linyi, Shandong, again 27,000 men. At the same time, the Communist army has greatly increased its strength in manpower and weapons compared to six months ago.

They said, "If the current rate continues, in three months, our strength will be in balance with Chiang's army, and we will begin to recover towns." (Note: In less than three months, we have recovered some towns. —Editor)

　　国共两军的战略与战术
    史特朗女士作  纪云译
    一边二百万人，一边一百五十万人，使这次战争成为历史上最大的内战。战争在十个省内继续打了六个月，经过约五十万人的死伤，双方战略显示出来了。
  城市换军队
    蒋方着重在夺取共党的城市，共党则着重夺取蒋的军队。
    蒋已夺取共党一百八十三个城市，共党收复了五十多，但蒋仍净得一百卅座。（按：这是去年底的数字。据二月七日延安总部公布数字七月至一月蒋共占一九九城，我收复一百城，蒋仅暂占九十九城。——编者）这些城市包括张家口、承德、淮阴等边区首府，以及苏北除仅剩一个以外的全部。不过，在上周，其中有的已为共党收复。蒋军扫清汉口以北的中原解放区，中原共军则越过一百左右大小村镇，开到陕甘宁边区以南地区。
    没有一个共产党人看来是灰心的。如果蒋介石可以夸张他的胜利。他们也可以，他们认为他们的胜利更重要。他们不断的在歼灭蒋的军队，他们声言已经消灭了蒋军五十万人，而且决不是靠残酷的屠杀而是靠生俘与转变到他们这边来。
  交通线与乡村
    两种战略如此不同，而竟能相遇于战场，实在使人惊奇。蒋凭武器与人力的优势，企图以打通铁道线和夺取战略重镇来达到控制华北。共军却带着铁轨上山去，把注意力放在“土地改革”上，于是，蒋占的战略城市就必然成为孤零零的据点，而被共军统治下的乡村包围起来。
    战役经常发生。共军失去城市，但没有吃败仗。他们输不起。蒋有军火来消耗。共党没有。他们必须使每个战役在人力、武器上有所获利。因此，他们不为城市而战，至少现在不是。他们的军人冷静地说：“这不是我们的战略。”
    当蒋军大队迫近一个城市时，共军就退出。“让他们进来，我们上山去！”（按：我们也不一定上山，照刘司令员的说法，我们是大踏步的进退。——编者）共军长官说。
    迟早，往往很快这些山上的守望者瞧见了伏击蒋军的机会——四旅之众！都成了他们的网中鱼。他们以压倒的兵力长驱直入加以包围“歼灭”。
  俘虏比杀伤多
    他们的军队所俘的比杀的多。当然，有战斗就有杀伤，据说杀伤的占被包围的百分之二十，大部分则连武器一起被俘。过了一周，他们就站在共军方面作战了。
    晋西南共军参谋蒋将军告诉我这种战术的一个实例。这里五个月“歼灭”了蒋军五个旅，因而增强了他们百分之二十的兵力。开始时，部队不战而退，让蒋军胡宗南所部占领了沿铁道线一连串的城市。共军事先拆走了铁轨。
    共军传播给胡宗南一个“情报”，说他们的主力在约六十英里外的某地，胡调动三个旅集中到该地，共军的主力实际上离开司令部仅十五英里，直冲下来包围了其中一个旅，一昼夜的战斗中把它打得粉碎。同时，其余两个旅则被当地游击队的小战斗牵制着。
    结果是一个旅被“歼灭”。共军在几天之后增加了五千七百人与大量的美国武器。这一个旅原来是蒋介石精锐部队之一。
    按理说，蒋的军官们应该很快学会了对付这种战术。可是这种战术仍一再奏效。共党说：日本人经过了八年才最后学会了中共的战术。他们责备蒋氏把前日本驻华军司令冈村宁次留在南京当顾问，教他如何打内战。共产党认为这是很重要的。“但是，这帮不了他，我们发明了对付蒋氏的新战术”。
  一年来的战果
    此刻，无线电正从各战场向延安报告六个月来的战果，“被歼灭的旅”的记载，在美国人看来正像世界丛书录。但每个小孩子都懂得，这是说，即使延安被侵占了，也不要紧。
    山东新四军军长陈毅将军报告：在五百次战斗中，蒋军伤亡五万零三百九十九人，被俘七万一千五百五十人。林彪将军从哈尔滨来电报告：一九四六年东北一千八百二十六次战斗中，蒋军损失十四万六千四百六十人。陇海路上刘伯承将军的报告：战斗三千八百二十三次，蒋军进犯部队四十九个旅，已被歼将近十八个旅——伤亡六万八千零九十三人，俘九万四千五百零三人。（按：一月份晋冀鲁豫全区又已消灭蒋军六万余人，收复城市十九座。——编者）
    刘在十一月间对延安记者说过：“我用十七个空城换得了蒋十四万大军，据说：蒋介石觉得这是一个好买卖，还要坚持做下去，我没有问题”。（按原语为：“好吧，让他做下去吧，在不久的将来就会算出总账的。”载十一月二十日本报——编者）
    共产党称：在一九四六年共歼蒋军四十六万三千人，在一九四七年的第一个星期，在山东临沂附近包围蒋军三个半旅，又是二万七千人，同时，共军在人力武器上比六个月以前大大增强了。
    他们说：“如果目前的速度继续下去，三个月后，我们与蒋军的力量将趋平衡，我们将开始收复城镇”。（按：不到三个月，我们已收复了一些城镇。——编者）
