    Jize Convenes County-Wide Central Cooperative Meeting
    To Promote Textile Production and Prepare Farm Tools
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 7th dispatch] Jize held a joint meeting of cadres from central cooperatives across the county on January 5th, with the Mass Cooperative as the main organizer. The meeting summarized the production of the past six months to prepare for the major spring production. Managers and directors from ten central cooperatives, including Wu Guanying, attended. According to reports from each cooperative, with a capital of 3.45 million yuan, a gross profit of more than 3.1 million yuan was earned in the second half of last year. During the meeting, based on reviews, it was proposed that cooperative cadres should first overcome negative thinking such as "piling up public affairs," "trying to please everyone," and "who knows the effort put into management." They should wholeheartedly serve the masses. It was decided that each central cooperative should lend cotton to collect cloth, or exchange cotton for cloth, lead the masses to organize transportation, and vigorously promote women's textile production. To solve the need for farm tools during spring plowing, blacksmith shops should rush to produce farm tools, and cooperatives should go to Taihang to purchase iron goods. Oil presses and cotton ginning workshops should absorb a large amount of surplus labor and semi-labor, increase rural income, and support spring plowing. In terms of business skills, it was proposed to do more research, plan more, purchase the necessities of the masses according to the needs of each season, and solve the difficulties of the masses, so as to smoothly carry out this year's great production movement.
