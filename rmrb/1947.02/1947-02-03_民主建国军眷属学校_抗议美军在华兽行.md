　　Democratic Founding Army Dependents' School
    Protests U.S. Military Atrocities in China
    [This newspaper dispatch] The teachers and students of the Democratic Founding Army Dependents' School, to protest the atrocities of the U.S. military in Peiping, sent a telegram to the Peiping and Tianjin Student Anti-American Association. The original telegram is as follows: To the People's Daily of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, transferred to the Joint Committee of Peiping and Tianjin Students Protesting U.S. Military Atrocities:
    Since the incident of Ms. Shen, a student at Peking University, being raped by a U.S. soldier, the news has spread, and all teachers and students in our school are filled with indignation at this kind of bestial behavior by the U.S. military! The insult to our female compatriots by the U.S. military is an insult to our Chinese nation! A surge of anger has been stirred up across the country against American imperialists interfering in China's internal affairs, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China. All our teachers and students pledge to be the rearguard and will strive to spin yarn and weave cloth, produce for self-sufficiency, and support the patriotic self-defense war with practical actions. This is hereby telegraphed, and please convey our sincere condolences to the victims.
    Respectfully,
    Liu Xiuzhen, Principal of the Democratic Founding Army Dependents' School, leading all teachers and students
                                                  January 20th
