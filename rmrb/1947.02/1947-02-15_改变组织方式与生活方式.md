    Changing Organizational Methods and Lifestyles

    The counter-offensive stage of the Patriotic Self-Defense War is approaching rapidly, and a new upsurge in the democratic movement is drawing nearer. The struggle is becoming increasingly tense and complex. To adapt to the new situation and strive for victory, it is necessary to change organizational methods and lifestyles. Comrade Liu Shaoqi made an appeal in Yan'an, and Comrade Bo Yibo recently made another appeal.

    Changing organizational methods means strictly obeying orders, strictly abiding by discipline, and resolutely abandoning erroneous thoughts and behaviors such as using "thorough ideological understanding" and "democratic discussion" as excuses to bargain with the organization, disobey assignments, being unwilling to stay in one's post, and planning everything from the perspective of personal or sectional interests. Currently, thorough ideological understanding means everything for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. Changing lifestyles means emphasizing hard work and struggle, sharing weal and woe with the soldiers, resolutely implementing the Party's call for production and frugality, and strictly prohibiting extravagance and waste. During the difficult combat period, strive to gradually balance the lives of cadres and soldiers.

    Many places have already made significant changes in this regard, but some places have not done enough. We hope that every unit and every comrade will use the words of Comrades Shaoqi and Yibo to examine themselves, so that this instruction can be implemented, because this is a necessary condition for us to complete the current historically significant task.

    改变组织方式与生活方式
    爱国自卫战争的反攻阶段快要到来，民主运动新高潮日益接近，斗争日趋紧张而复杂。为了适应新的形势，争取胜利，必须改变组织方式与生活方式。刘少奇同志在延安曾做过号召，最近薄一波同志又号召了一次。
    改变组织方式就是严格服从命令，严格遵守纪律，坚决抛掉借口“打通思想”、“民主讨论”，因而对组织讨价还价，不服从分配，不安于职守，一切从个人或部分利益打算等错误思想行为。目前打通思想就是一切为了打败蒋介石。改变生活方式，就是强调艰苦奋斗，与士卒同甘苦，坚决贯彻党的生产与节约的号召，严禁铺张浪费。在战斗困难期间，使干部与战士生活逐渐趋于平衡。
    许多地方在这方面已有重大转变，但有的地方还做得不够。我们希望每个单位每个同志都用少奇和一波两同志的话检查自己，使这个指示得到贯彻，因为这是我们完成当前有历史意义的任务的必需条件。
