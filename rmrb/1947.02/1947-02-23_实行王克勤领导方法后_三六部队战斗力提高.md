　　After Implementing Wang Keqin's Leadership Methods, Combat Effectiveness of the 36th Regiment Increased
    [This newspaper's front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 21st dispatch] The battalions of the 36th Regiment had already disseminated and discussed Wang Keqin's leadership methods at the cadre meetings of platoons and squads and the meetings of mutual aid team leaders in December of last year. Some squads discussed it two or three times, pointing out a path for leadership to cadres at all levels of the company. The troops were able to quickly improve their skills through mutual assistance and learning during peacetime or marches, and during wartime, their actions were courageous and skillful, with small casualties and large victories. For example, during the winter march of the 8th Squad of the 1st Company of the 69th Regiment, two new comrades were young and one newly liberated comrade was physically weak. Two mutual aid teams carried their belongings, ensuring that no one fell behind. Cheng Zhaoyou, a young soldier liberated from Juan'nan, donated his own blanket to make foot wraps for the whole squad. Chen Yuting, a comrade liberated from Shangguan Village, also donated his socks to Cheng Zhaoyou. Comrades competed to do public service duties in the squad, and there was never any quarreling or scolding. During the pursuit battle in Yutai on January 9th, when a small team received the pursuit mission, the 8th Squad acted quickly, pursuing at the forefront. The whole squad obtained five new rifles and no one was injured. On January 12th, when annihilating Zhang Lanfeng's 1st Battalion of puppet bandits near Sima Temple in Jinxiang, the 1st Small Team was the assault team. After breaking into the village, the 8th Squad developed very quickly. When the enemy was forced onto the high blockhouse, the 8th Squad shouted and persuaded four of them to surrender. After our artillery destroyed the blockhouse, they immediately rushed up, obtaining a Czech machine gun, twenty-one rifles, one small cannon, and one pistol, and capturing dozens of prisoners. In the merit book, Deputy Squad Leader Li Zhuwu and mutual aid group leaders Cheng Zhaoyou and Feng Zhanchun were awarded a major merit once, and Chen Yuting, Zhang Guangqian, and Yu Wanmin were also awarded merits.

　　实行王克勤领导方法后
    三六部队战斗力提高
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】三六部队各营曾在去年十二月即在班排干部会议上和互助组组长会议上传达讨论王克勤领导方法，有的班讨论过两三次，给连队各级干部领导上指出了一条道路。部队能在平时或行军中，以互助互学方式迅速提高技术，战时则动作勇猛机巧，伤亡小战果大。如六九部一连八班冬季行军，有两个新同志年纪小，一个新解放同志体力弱，两个互助组背东西，保证了没一个掉队的。鄄南解放过来的青年战士程兆由，把自己单子捐出来，给全班做包脚布。上官村解放过来的陈雨亭同志也把自己袜子捐给程兆由穿。班里公差勤务争着干，从不吵骂。一月九日鱼台追击战中一小队领受追击任务时，八班动作快，追在最前面，全班共得了五枝新枪，没一个挂彩的。一月十二日在金乡四马庙集附近歼灭伪匪张岚峰第一营时，一小队是突击队，突进村后，八班发展很快，当敌人被逼上高炮楼后，八班喊话喊过来四个。当我们炮兵把炮楼打垮以后，他们紧接着冲上，得了捷克机枪一挺，步枪二十一枝，小炮一门，手枪一枝，俘获数十名。记功簿上副班长李柱五互助会议组长程兆由、冯占春被记大功一次，陈雨亭、张广乾、于万民也都记上了功。（仇波）
