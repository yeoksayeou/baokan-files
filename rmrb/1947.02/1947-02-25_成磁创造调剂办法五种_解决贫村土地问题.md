[This article was transmitted from Southern Hebei on the 22nd.] Chengci has universally resolved the land problems in poor villages, creating five methods for transferring land:

(1) Under the principle of permitting conditions and mass consent, launch joint struggles, and villages participating in the struggle jointly distribute land. For example, Wanghengcheng has 122 households, 745 people, and 2,920.9 mu of land, averaging less than 4 mu per person; landlords and feudal rich peasants, accounting for 28% of the village's population, own 75% of the village's land; and extremely poor peasants, accounting for 52% of the village's population, own only 7% of the village's land. Most of the landlord's land was seized from farmers in Wanghengcheng and nearby Zhaohengcheng and Zhangwuzhuang during famine years. Zhaohengcheng has 86 households, 448 people, and 713.4 mu of land, averaging just over 1.5 mu per person. There are no landlords or feudal rich peasants in the entire village, and many poor people work as tenant farmers and laborers in other villages. Although Zhangwuzhuang also has some landlords, not much land can be recovered through struggle. Based on the class and land situation in the above three villages, the village cadres and masses of Wanghengcheng were mobilized three times, educating the entire village to unify their thinking. In the joint struggle, 400 mu of land were transferred and distributed to villages such as Zhaohengcheng. In addition, Changxiang Village transferred 90 mu to villages such as Lixiaotun, and Nanshangcheng transferred 130 mu of land to Taibianzhuang.

(2) Mobilize rich villages to sell some land to poor villages. For example, after the struggle in Xipengliu Village, the average person in the village could get more than 10 mu, while the villages near Xipengliu were very poor. After education, the village kept 6 mu of land per person, and the rest was sold to the surrounding poor villages at a low price.

(3) Combine villages for struggle and distribute land equally. For example, Dongbao Village and Xibao Village were originally one village, but due to conflicts between the rulers on the east and west sides, they were divided into two villages. The masses on the east and west sides also discriminated against each other under the instigation of landlords. Dongbao Village has more landlords, with an average of more than 5 mu per person, while Xibao Village has fewer landlords, with an average of 2 mu per person. Therefore, the east and west sides merged for struggle, took out land for equal distribution, and solved the land problem of the farmers in the west. Since then, the two villages have merged, and the masses have also united.

(4) Solve land problems from the handling of pawn relationships. In general, the land pawned by landlords and feudal rich peasants in rich villages to poor villages is all turned into dead land and handled by the farmers' associations in poor villages; the land pawned by poor villages to rich villages is all recovered. Through this method, Wuji Village obtained more than 70 mu of land from Beilangbu, and Xiaotun Village obtained more than 30 mu of land from Changxiang Village.

(5) Mobilize rich villages to transfer support land to poor villages, that is, mobilize the masses in rich villages to redeem the land pawned to rich villages and then transfer it to poor villages. This work requires repeated ideological mobilization, because the masses are unwilling to bother for others. Through this method, Wuji Village obtained 76 mu of land from Chenbiandong Village, and the Sixth District transferred more than 500 mu to the Chengguan District of Linzhang, so that farmers in the two counties deeply realized that "farmers all over the world are one family."

　　成磁创造调剂办法五种
    解决贫村土地问题
    【本报冀南二十二日电】成磁普遍解决贫村土地问题，创造转移土地办法：（一）条件许可，群众同意原则下发动联合斗争，参加斗争村庄共同分配土地。如王横城一百二十二户人家，七百四十五口人，占有土地二千九百二十亩九分，每人平均四亩弱；占该村人口百分之二十八的地主及封建富农，占有全村百分之七十五的土地；占全村人口百分之五十二的赤贫农，仅占有全村百分之七的土地。地主土地大部是灾荒年剥夺本村与附近赵横城与张武庄农民的。赵横城有八十六户，四百四十八口人，地七百一十三亩四分，每人平均一·五亩强，全村没一户地主与封建富农，赤贫多给外村当佃户雇工。张武庄虽各有一家经营地主，经过斗争，亦不能收回多少土地。根据以上三村阶级、土地情况，对王横城村干群众进行了三次动员，教育全村一致打通思想，在联合斗争中转移出土地四百亩，分给赵横城等村。此外长巷村转移出九十亩给李小屯等村；南商城转移给泰遍庄土地一百卅亩。（二）动员富村出卖一部土地给贫村，如西彭留村，斗争后全村每人平均可得十余亩，接近西彭留的村却很穷。经过教育，该村每人留够六亩地，其余全部低价卖给周围穷村。（三）合村斗争平均分配土地。如东西保庄本是一个村，因东西两头封闭统治者有矛盾，划为两个村。东西两头群众在地主挑拨下亦互相歧视，东保庄地主多，每人平均五亩以上，西保庄地主少，每人平均二亩。因此东西头合并进行斗争，拿出土地平均分配，解决了西头农民土地问题。自此两村合并，群众也团结了。（四）从处理典当关系中解决土地问题。一般富村地主与封建富农出典给贫村的土地一律变为死地，归贫村农会处理；贫村典给富村的土地一律收回。经过这个办法，武吉村从北郎堡得到土地七十余亩，小屯村从长巷村得到土地三十余亩。（五）动员富村给贫村转赡土地，即动员富村群众赡回典给富村的土地，再转移给贫村。这一工作须经反复的思想动员，因群众不愿专为他人麻烦。经过这样办法，武吉村从陈边董村得到土地七十六亩，六区转移给临漳城关区五百多亩，使两县农民深刻认识到“天下农民是一家”。
