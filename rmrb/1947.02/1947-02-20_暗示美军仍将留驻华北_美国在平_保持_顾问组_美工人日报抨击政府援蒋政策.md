Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Peiping on the 11th, "Reliable sources here have learned that the U.S. military advisory group stationed in Nanking plans to maintain an advisory group in Peiping after the U.S. side withdraws from the Executive Headquarters. The arrival in Peiping of Major General Rooks, head of the advisory group, to meet with Lieutenant General Gillem, the U.S. member of the Nanking Executive Headquarters, seems to confirm the implication that there will be American troops in North China in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. The February 4th press release from the Peiping Executive Headquarters quoted the February 1st "U.S. Worker's Daily" comment on the U.S. suspension of mediation. The paper opposed the policy of sending troops to China and supplying Chiang Kai-shek with arms. The paper stated: "We are pleased that we are linked with the great democratic movement in the United States, of which General Stilwell is a symbol." The paper generally stated: "It is now reported that the U.S. military mission is still training Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and the U.S. naval base in Qingdao is still being maintained. We believe that the State Department must declare that the Chiang regime is not worthy of help in any way and stop all secret deals with the Chiang regime." The "Worker's Daily" received a letter of emotion from Mrs. Stilwell after the United States announced the suspension of mediation, and the above comments were made in response to this matter.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. The "Ta Kung Pao" of Tianjin on February 5th published a New York dispatch from its special correspondent Zhu Qiping entitled "The 80th U.S. Congress," which stated that neutral American public opinion was reviewing its China policy and considered it to be twofold: one set on the surface and another in practice. The actual action is to cultivate Chinese reactionary forces, using the Kuomintang government to oppose the Soviet Union and communism in both military and political terms. The Vandenberg policy is making the U.S. government move further away from the work of democratizing China. The dispatch generally stated: "The United States does not shy away from our interference, and the Republican 'New York Herald Tribune' said in a New York dispatch on January 5th: 'The mere fact that U.S. troops were stationed in China during and after the war constitutes a major interference in Chinese politics. The question has never been whether to interfere or not, but how to interfere to our (American) advantage.'" Zhu's dispatch pointed out: "Under the current U.S. policy of supporting Japan, the smooth result of the U.S. anti-Soviet and the Kuomintang government's anti-communist actions will be the reoccurrence of the September 18th Incident."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanking on the 13th, American engineering geologist Zhong Ru, at the invitation of the Chiang government, will come to China to inspect various water conservancy and power generation projects. The Chiang government's Water Conservancy and Power Generation Engineering Office of the Resources Committee will send personnel to accompany the inspection.

　　暗示美军仍将留驻华北
    美国在平“保持”顾问组
    美工人日报抨击政府援蒋政策
    【新华社延安十八日电】据美国新闻处北平十一日电称：“此间可靠方面获悉，美国驻南京之军事顾问团计划于军调部美方撤退之后，在北平保持一个顾问组。顾问团团长鲁克斯少将之到达北平与宁调部美方委员吉伦中将开会一事，似乎证实这一暗示，即今后在华北不会没有美军。
    【新华社延安十八日电】据北平执行部二月四日新闻司所发布新闻中引二月一日美国工人日报评美国停止调解事宜。该报反对派遣军队驻华和供给蒋介石军火的政策。该报称：“我们引为高兴的是我们和美国伟大的民主运动联在一起，史迪威将军便是这个运动的象征。”该报总称：“现据报美国军事使团仍在训练蒋介石军队，美国在青岛的海军基地仍然保持着。我们认为国务院必须宣布蒋政权在任何方面均不值得帮助，并停止和蒋政权的一切秘密交易。”工人日报在美国宣布停止调解后收到史迪威夫人一封表示感慨的信，该报上述评论即系对此事而发。
    【新华社延安十八日电】二月五日天津大公报载，该报特派员朱启平纽约通讯“美国八十届国会”称：美国中立舆论检讨对华政策，认为是两重的：表面上一套，实际上又是一套。实际行动是培植中国反动势力，在军事上政治上都在使用国民党政府反苏反共。范登堡政策，是使美政府更远离使中国民主化的工作。该通讯总称：美国并不讳言对我们的干涉，共和党的纽约先锋论坛报，其一月五日一段纽约通讯中即说：“单以战时及战后美军驻华一事而论，即已构成对中国政治的重大干涉。问题一直不是干涉与否，而是怎样干涉才能于我国（美国）有利。”朱氏通讯指出：“在现在美国扶持日本政策下，美国反苏和国民党政府反共的顺利结果，将是九一八的重临。”
    【新华社延安十八日电】据中央社南京十三日电，美国工程地质学家钟入应蒋政府之请将来华视察各水利发电工程，蒋政府资委会水利发电工程总处并派人陪同视察。
