Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to the late Shanghai Masses Weekly, the Shanghai Workers' Association, in order to deny the Jiang clique's "Constitution" and support the student patriotic movement, issued a "Letter to Workers and Staff" on January 7th. The letter first pointed out the illegality of the one-party "National Congress" and exposed the reactionary nature of the "Constitution," stating: "Recently, officials of the Kuomintang government have been trumpeting that the passage of the Constitution was 'based on the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference,' and how 'democratic' its content is. But this 'Constitution' does not have a trace of democracy; it is just another means by which the Kuomintang reactionaries deceive the people and continue their one-party dictatorship."

The letter pointed out: On the one hand, the reactionaries convene the so-called "National Assembly" and pass the so-called "Constitution"; on the other hand, they launch large-scale attacks and massacres against the people in the Liberated Areas. In their own areas of rule, they attack the people by suppressing the labor movement, banning street vendors, sealing up books and newspapers, conscripting soldiers, levying exorbitant taxes, and engaging in secret agent terror. As far as we Shanghai workers are concerned, the workers' organizations and labor associations were forced to reorganize, workers' leader Mr. Zhu Xuefan was forced to go abroad, and secret agents even followed him to Hong Kong and injured him with a car. The Kuomintang is further attempting to "Party-ize" the workers and force them to join the Party. The "Military-Industrial Team," a secret agent organization in the factory, is training secret agents to assassinate progressive elements among the workers, and they are being trained in rotation. Two terms, totaling more than 500 people, have already been trained. It is said that ten consecutive terms will be trained to cultivate more executioners. The "conscription" that is about to be implemented in the Shanghai area will bring even greater misfortune to the workers. All of this is enough to illustrate the extreme hypocrisy of the "Constitution."

The letter further pointed out: Those who recognize this Constitution, besides the Kuomintang reactionaries themselves and their lackeys, also include the American imperialist agents, Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart. This is not surprising, as it was obtained by the Kuomintang government selling out the country's naval, land, and air force bases, troop deployment rights, and navigation rights. The humiliating "Sino-American Commercial Treaty" has been signed, and the American military is not withdrawing from Chinese soil. American imperialism has already regarded China as its colony, and the Chinese people are seen as their colonial slaves in the eyes of the Americans, while the Kuomintang authorities are wholeheartedly acting as their slave overseers. The letter protested against the facts of the US military atrocities in the past, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the US military and the abolition of all unequal treaties between China and the US, expressing respect and support for the student patriotic movement.

The letter stated: The people are unwilling to be slaves. The Japanese wanted to enslave us, and we overthrew them. Now the Americans want to enslave us, and we will certainly not allow them to be an exception! The letter finally stated: We will unite with workers, students, staff, farmers, and national capitalists throughout the country to advance the cause of the Chinese people's liberation movement! And unite with workers in the United States and around the world, as well as those who advocate justice and peace, to strive for world peace and democracy!

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily reports from Hong Kong on the 4th: The Hong Kong All Circles Anti-Civil War Alliance, Women's Federation, Young Journalists Association Branch, Literary Association Branch, Huashang Daily, Zheng Bao, Guangming Bao, and Minchao Society, and 43 other people's organizations, have jointly sent a telegram to the whole country opposing the "Constitution" passed by the one-party "National Assembly."

　　上海工人协会发表告职工书
    否认伪宪支援爱国学运
    表示将联合全国职工、学生、农民、民族资本家为中国人民翻身运动一道前进！
    香港人民团体反对伪宪
    【新华社延安三日电】据迟到的上海群众周刊载，上海工人协会为否认蒋记“宪法”支援学生爱国运动，于元月七日发表“告工人职员书”。书中首先指出一党“国大”的非法性，揭露“宪法”的反动性称：“近来国民党政府官员们大吹大擂的说通过宪法是‘根据政协宪草通过’的，内容是如何的‘民主’。但这部‘宪法’并没有一点民主的气息，只不过是国民党反动派又一套欺骗人民、继续一党专政的手段罢了”。该书指出：反动派一方面召开什么“国民大会”，通过什么“宪法”；一方面大规模向解放区人民进攻屠杀。在其自己统治区，则以压迫工运、取缔摊贩、封禁书报、抓丁、苛捐、特务恐怖等手段向人民进攻。而就我们上海工人说，这次的工人团体劳动协会等被迫改组，工人领袖朱学范先生被迫出国，特务还又跟踪到香港用汽车把他碰伤。国民党更进一步在企图“党化”工人，强迫工人入党；工厂中的特务组织“军工队”即为了训练特务进行暗杀工人中的进步分子，正在轮流调训，现在训练出的已有两期共五百多人。据说，将要连续训练十期，培养更多的刽子手。马上就要实行的上海地区“征兵”，将给工人带来更大的厄运。在在皆足以说明该“宪法”之极端虚伪性。该书进一步指出：承认这部宪法的，除了国民党反动派自己及其走狗外，还有的就是美帝国主义代理人马歇尔元帅和司徒雷登大使，这是不足为怪的，这是国民党政府出卖祖国海陆空军基地、驻兵权和航海等权换取得来的。丧权辱国的“中美商约”签订了，美军在中国土地上不撤走，美帝国主义已经把中国当作他的殖民地，中国人民在美国人的眼里看成为他们的殖民地奴隶，而国民党当局死心塌地做他的奴隶总管。该书对历次美军暴行事实提出抗议，要求美军立即撤退及废除中美间一切不平等条约，对学生爱国运动表示敬意和支持。该书称：人民是不愿做奴隶的，日本人要奴役我们，给我们打倒了；现在美国人要奴役我们，当然也不允许它例外！该书最后表示：将联合全国工人以及一切学生、职员、农民、民族资本家，为中国人民的翻身运动一道前进！并联合美国及全世界工人以及主张正义和平的人士，为争取世界的和平民主而奋斗！
    【新华社延安三日电】上海文汇报载香港四日讯：香港各界反内战大同盟、妇女联谊会、青年记者学会分会、文协分会、华商报、正报、光明报、民潮社等四十三个人民社团顷联合通电全国，反对一党“国大”所通过之“宪法”。
