　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Brutally Abuse Even Underground Martyrs
　　Destroying Martyrs' Steles and Pagodas, Exhuming Graves, Opening Coffins, and Shattering Corpses
　　The JiluYu Assembly Sends a Telegram to the Nation Protesting
　　[Our newspaper's JiluYu Front, 27th dispatch] After Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied our Heze, Jining, Shanxian, and other places, they slaughtered our anti-Japanese martyrs' steles and pagodas everywhere, and the people of the border area were all indignant. The JiluYu Assembly Office, representing the people of the entire area, sent a telegram to the nation protesting. The original telegram stated: Chiang Kai-shek's troops have turned houses into ruins everywhere. What is even more heartbreaking is the destruction of the martyrs' cemetery. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our soldiers and civilians risked their lives and shed blood, sacrificing heroically for the country and the nation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the people of the liberated areas, cherishing the loyal and righteous, built martyrs' cemeteries in many scenic areas. During the Chiang Kai-shek troops' offensive, Wu Huawen and Fang Xianjue and others wantonly destroyed the martyrs' cemeteries in Jining, Heze, Hua County, Shan County, and other places, as well as thousands of martyrs' graves, dissecting human corpses and scattering bones and ashes. This is something that the Japanese invaders never did and the Chinese traitors dared not do, yet the Chiang bandits have done it so brazenly! Those who see it are heartbroken, and those who hear it are furious! They opened coffins and shattered corpses of the heroes who sacrificed for the country, abusing them even in the afterlife; while the bandit chief Yasuji Okamura is treated as an honored guest. This is clearly treating relatives as enemies and recognizing bandits as fathers. How can the Chiang bandits be Chinese?
　　[Our newspaper's Taiyue Front, 28th dispatch] Yan Xishan trained a group of secret agents in the counties he occupied, calling them "Love the Village Corps," to suppress the masses' resistance with terror. After invading Yicheng, the "Love the Village Corps" massively arrested and killed innocent farmers. Recently, more than 300 corpses of farmers who had been killed were discovered in a certain place in Wushan, Yicheng. The families who came to claim the bodies "held the corpses and cried bitterly, cursing the 'Love the Village Corps' as the 'Harm the Village Corps'." (He Wei, Ke Ren)

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十七日电】蒋军进占我荷泽、济宁、单县等处后，到处遏杀我抗日烈士碑塔，边区人民无不愤怒。冀鲁豫参议会办事处代表全区人民，通电全国抗议，原电略谓：蒋军到处庐台为墟，尤足令人痛心者，厥性摧残烈士陵园一事。八年抗战中间，我军民拼命流血，为国家民族英勇牺牲。抗战胜利以后，解放区人民，眷念忠烈，在名胜地区建筑烈士陵园多处。蒋军进攻之际，吴逆化文，方逆先觉等，竟将济宁、荷泽、滑县、单县等处烈士陵园，并数千烈士灵墓，恣意捣毁，剖开人尸，撒骨扬尘。此日寇所未曾使汉奸所不敢为者，蒋贼竟悍然为之！见者痛心，闻者发指！对为国牺牲之英烈，开棺碎尸，虐及黄泉；而寇酋岗村宁次，反款为上宾。是直以亲为仇，认贼作父，蒋贼岂为中国人。
