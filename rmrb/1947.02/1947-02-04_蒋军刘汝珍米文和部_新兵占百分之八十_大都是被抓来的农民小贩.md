(From the Frontline of Ji-Lu-Yu [Southern Hebei, Western Shandong, and Eastern Henan] on the 1st) Many of the soldiers of the Chiang troops of Liu Ruzhen and Mi Wenhe who laid down their weapons in the Xitaiji battle in Dingtao were new recruits. According to them, soldiers with one to three months of service accounted for more than 80% of the Chiang troops in these two units. In some cases, the entire squad, except for the squad leader, consisted of new recruits. These new recruits were mostly captured peasants and a small number of small traders. They opposed the civil war and were unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek. On the way to the front line this time, many deserted. In the 220th Regiment alone, two battalions saw more than 200 men desert. Those who did not escape handed over their guns to the Eighth Route Army in groups on the battlefield without firing a single shot. The new Chiang soldiers liberated by us in Xitaiji accused the Chiang army of its crimes one after another. They said, "Only by liberating our homes will we no longer be oppressed by Chiang Kai-shek." To achieve this goal, many of them have voluntarily joined the Eighth Route Army.

　　蒋军刘汝珍米文和部
    新兵占百分之八十
    大都是被抓来的农民小贩
    【本报冀鲁豫前线一日电】在定陶西台集战斗中放下武器之蒋军刘汝珍米文和部士兵多系新兵，据他们自称：该两部蒋军中一个月至三个月军龄之士兵占百分之八十以上，甚至除去班长外全班都是新兵，这些新兵多系抓来的农民和少数小商贩，他们反对内战不甘心替蒋介石卖命。在这一次开来前线时，中途逃亡很多，只二二○团的两个营就逃亡了二百多名，没有逃脱的就在战场上一枪未发成群的把枪交给八路军。西台集被我解放之蒋军新兵纷纷控诉蒋军罪行，他们说：“只有把我们的家解放了，才不再受蒋介石的欺压。”为达到这个目的，他们很多已自动参加了八路军。
