    New Achievements in Soviet Literature and Art After Strengthened Leadership

    Simonov's New Play

    Three theaters in Moscow and Leningrad are currently rehearsing Konstantin Simonov's new play, "The Russian Question." This play is based on Simonov's impressions from his trip to the United States, depicting the moral degradation of reactionary newspapers and the many slanders and fabrications of foreign newspapers against the Soviet Union. The protagonist of the play is an American journalist, Henry Smith, who is sent to the Soviet Union by the Great New York Publishing Company to write a book defaming the Soviet Union, a book that should answer ten questions, all of which boil down to "Why do Russians need war?" Smith rejects Turley's task of writing nonsense, and after returning home, he writes a book reporting the true situation of the Soviet Union, giving negative answers to all ten questions.

    Two Novels Depicting Soviet Heroic Figures

    The magazine "Soviet Literature" recently published two new novels: one is "The Night of the Strategist" by Belyayev, a war story depicting an important military battle. The protagonist of this story is General Lyutatin, the commander who drafted the battle plan, and Nikolai Uranov, a young volunteer on his first front line experience. The author describes the progress of the battle from the respective perspectives of these two individuals. The other story, written by film director Alexander Dovzhenko, is "Life in Bloom," depicting the life of the great Russian biological breeder, Ivan Michurin. The story tells us that in pre-revolutionary Russia, when Michurin already enjoyed world fame, he struggled to fight for the right to conduct experiments, and was persecuted by priests as a result. Only under Soviet power was Michurin properly recognized in his own country, his experiments attracted the attention of Lenin, and were widely expanded. (TASS dispatch)

    加强领导后的苏联文艺新果
    西蒙诺夫的新剧
    莫斯科和列宁格勒的三个剧院，都正在预演着康士坦丁·西蒙诺夫新著的剧本《俄国人问题》。这个剧本是根据西蒙诺夫旅行美国的印象写的，其中表现着反动报纸的道德沦丧以及外国报纸对苏联的许多造谣诽谤。剧本的主角是美国新闻记者享利·史密斯，他被大纽约出版公司派到苏联去写作诽谤苏联的书籍，在这一本书中要回答十个问题，总起来说就是《为什么俄国人需要战争？》斯氏摈窠了图利滥写的任务，回国以后，他就写了一本报导苏联真实情况的书，对十个问题统统作了否定的回答。
    两篇描写苏联英雄人物的小说
    苏维埃文学杂志上最近发表了两篇新小说：一篇是白里捷特所写的战争故事：《战略家之夜》，描写一次重要的军事战斗，这篇故事的主角是订出作战计划的军长律亚提宁将军，和初上前线的年轻的志愿兵尼古拉·乌拉诺夫。作者从这两个人各自的看法描述了这次作战的进展。另一篇故事写电影演出者亚历山大·德夫日科所著的：《花中生涯》，描写伟大的俄罗斯生物选种学家，伊凡·米邱林的生活，故事告诉我们，在革命前的俄罗斯，当米邱林已经享有世界盛名的时候，他曾为争取进行实验的权利而斗争，因而遭受到牧师的迫害。只有在苏维埃的权力下，米邱林在自己的国家里才被适当的认识，他的实验引起了列宁的注意，而且被广泛的展开了。（塔斯社电）
