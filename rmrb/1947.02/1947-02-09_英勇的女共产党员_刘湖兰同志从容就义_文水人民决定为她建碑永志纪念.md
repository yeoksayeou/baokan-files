    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th: On January 12th, the Yan army bloodily washed Yunzhou Village, Wenxi County. Liu Hulan, a seventeen-year-old female Communist Party member, was also forced to be interrogated in public. The Yan army asked her, "Are you a Communist Party member?" She replied, "Yes." They asked again, "Why did you join the Communist Party?" She answered, "The Communist Party works for the people." "Will you continue to work for the Communist Party in the future?" "As long as I live, I will do it to the end!" At this point, the Yan army brought out a guillotine and beheaded old man Chen Benzi, who was over seventy years old, and Shi Shihui, etc., in front of her. Then they said to her, "As long as you don't work for the Eighth Route Army in the future, we won't guillotine you." This young female Communist Party member resolutely replied, "That is impossible!" The Yan army threatened, "Are you really willing to die?" She said, "What's so scary about death?" The resolute Liu Hulan calmly lay under the guillotine and shouted, "Kill me if you want! Even if I live another seventeen years, it will still be like this!" She died heroically. The villagers present harbored deep hatred for the Yan army's atrocities. To mourn the heroic sacrifice of this female people's hero, it was decided to erect a monument to commemorate her forever.
    This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline, 5th: Gao Sifa, the leader of the children's corps, who was praised by the more than two hundred people who had suffered and were liberated from the Jiang army prison after the recapture of Shan County, was originally a child of a coolie worker outside the east gate of Shan County. He was an activist in the anti-traitor struggle last year. After the traitor Zhang Ruisheng was struggled against, he held a grudge. After the Jiang army occupied the city on September 2nd last autumn, Zhang turned to Zhou Juezi (Zhou Hecun), the Jiang army county magistrate, plotting to kill him. When he was escorted to the execution ground by the Jiang army, he shouted the slogan "Support Chairman Mao, oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek" before his execution. The twenty-five peasants who were executed at the same execution ground also shouted loudly. The remains of the twenty-six martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the people this time were buried in Zhang＠榘 outside the east gate, and the families of the martyrs have been given relief by the democratic government.

    【新华社晋绥七日电】上月十二日，阎军血洗文水县云周村，十七岁的女共产党员刘湖兰也被迫当众审讯。阎军问她：“是不是共产党员？”她答：“是。”又问“你为什么参加共产党？”答：“共产党为老百姓做事。”“今后是否还给共产党办事？”“只要活一天，就要干到底！”至此，阎军便抬出铡刀在她面前铡死七十多岁的老人陈本子同石世辉等人，然后对她说：“只要今后不给八路军办事，就不铡死你。”这位青年女共产党员坚决回答：“那是办不到的事！”阎军威吓说：“你真的愿意死？”她说：“死有什么可怕？”刚毅的刘湖兰从容地躺在铡刀下大声说：“要杀由你们吧，我再活十七岁还不是这个样子！”她慷慨就义了。在场的全村父老对阎军暴行怀着深海的仇恨。为痛悼这位人民女英雄英勇就义，决定为她立碑永久纪念。
