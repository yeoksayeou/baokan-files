To administrative and branch leaders of all agencies directly under the Central Committee:

    I. In order to respond to the call of the Central Bureau and Comrade Yibo for production and conservation to welcome the light, and to carry out this year's great production movement together with the masses of the entire region, to independently solve the difficulties of agencies and individuals, and to more powerfully support the front lines in striving for victory, we must currently intensify the personal production movement in agencies, and combine this movement with the improvement of our agency administration and agency branch work.

    II. The personal production movement in agencies is the mass production movement of agencies. In order to rapidly launch this movement, we must overcome the views of some comrades who rely solely on the public and who despise labor and are unwilling to do it themselves. We must regard production as equally important as work and study, change some of our agency's organizational methods and work methods, strive to save expenses, and strive to enable each comrade to squeeze out more time to engage in regular production. We must all take action, be organized and planned, and closely coordinate this production with agency production.

    III. Personal production tasks cannot be the same for everyone and must be specifically stipulated according to the differences in each person's labor force and time. In principle, all agency personnel should have tasks, with a minimum task of one hour of production per day. Those who produce for more than two hours a day, in addition to turning in public tasks, should also have personal self-sufficiency and family-building tasks, which must be completed in the same way as public tasks. Those who exceed the tasks will be rewarded. The table is as follows:

    Those with a daily one-hour production task: Deliver 150 jin of rice to the public throughout the year.

    Those with a daily two-hour production task: Deliver 200 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 50 jin of rice, totaling 250 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily three-hour production task: Deliver 250 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 100 jin of rice, totaling 350 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily four-hour production task: Deliver 300 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 150 jin of rice, totaling 450 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily five-hour production task: Deliver 350 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 200 jin of rice, totaling 550 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily six-hour production task: Deliver 400 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 250 jin of rice, totaling 650 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily seven-hour production task: Deliver 450 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 300 jin of rice, totaling 750 jin of rice.

    Those with a daily eight-hour production task: Deliver 500 jin of rice to the public throughout the year, self-sufficient 350 jin of rice, totaling 850 jin of rice.

    IV. Without hindering work and on a voluntary basis, it is possible to implement work exchange assistance or substitute farming tasks. The active significance of conservation is production. Except for clothing, surplus grain, and allowances, which are subject to separate conservation methods, other conservation can be included in the production tasks. However, in principle, we do not emphasize passive conservation, profit-making, or profiteering, but emphasize actively creating wealth through labor.

    V. Each comrade in the agency, including agency family members, must formulate a specific plan on how to ensure the completion of the task when formulating this year's production task and submit it to the production leadership to jointly review it with the administration and branch. Each agency must make accurate statistics on the finally approved production tasks and production plans, and report them to us on one hand, and promote the combination of similar production on the other hand, so as to understand and grasp the central production and backbone components, to promote the entire production movement, and on the basis of these production combinations, prepare to establish agency personnel cooperatives, so as to better organize production, sales, and consumption savings.

    VI. In order to be suitable for regular part-time labor and to widely attract labor, we propose to develop handicraft industry as the main focus, and agriculture and miscellaneous work as supplements. Currently, some departments are organizing textile groups, taking textile as the center to attract part-time labor and family production; some departments are also preparing to develop production and conservation that combines their own business or takes into account both public and private interests, which are all good.

    VII. In order to promote this movement, it is hoped that the administration of each agency will provide the necessary funds, tools, and equipment as much as possible, and adopt the method of collecting tasks in stages and gradually increasing the proportion of tasks to be handed over. The agency branch will take ensuring the development of this movement as its current central task, pay attention to the promotion of production emotions and production methods at any time, cultivate activists, and prevent various deviations that may arise. The agency branch and administration will regard personal production achievements and production performance as one of the items to be listed in the appraisal when they are transferred to work or at a certain period.

    VIII. The development of the personal production movement depends on the strengthening of the original wall newspaper organizations of each agency. Around this central task, put forward timely slogans, organize various reports, and effectively carry out publicity and encouragement. Next month, we plan to conduct the first production review of this year and simultaneously review the wall newspapers. At present, our requirements are: Resolutely respond to the call for production and conservation put forward by the Party, formulate plans, take action, and organize!

    The administration and branches of each directly affiliated agency should specifically discuss and deploy according to this notice, and no further notice will be given.

### 关于开展机关个人生产运动  中央局行政处及总支委会的通知

专栏：

    关于开展机关个人生产运动
    中央局行政处及总支委会的通知中直各机关行政及支部负责同志：
    一、为了响应中央局及一波同志生产节约迎接光明的号召，与全区群众一起，开展今年的大生产运动，求得独立的解决机关与个人的困难，更有力的支援前线争取胜利，目前我们必须加紧开展机关个人生产运动，并将这一运动和我们机关行政与机关支部工作的改进结合起来。
    二、机关个人生产运动，就是机关的群众生产运动，为使这一运动迅速开展，必须克服有些同志专靠公家的观点，和轻视劳动不愿亲自动手的观点。必须把生产看作与工作和学习同样重要，改变我们机关的某些组织方式和工作方式，求得能节省开支，并求得每一同志能更多挤出时间从事经常的生产。必须大家动起手来，有组织、有计划，并把这一生产与机关生产取得密切配合。
    三、个人生产任务不能一律，须按各人劳动力及时间的差别而具体规订。原则上所有机关人员都应有任务，而以每日一小时生产为起码任务。每日二小时以上者，除交公任务外，并应有个人自给建家的任务，和交公任务一样的必须完成，超过任务者有奖。兹列表如下：
    每日一小时生产任务者：全年交公一五○斤米。
    每日二小时生产任务者：全年交公二○○斤米，自给五○斤米，共计二五○斤米。
    每日三小时生产任务者：全年交公二五○斤米，自给一○○斤米，共计三五○斤米。
    每日四小时生产任务者：全年交公三○○斤米，自给一五○斤米，共计四五○斤米。
    每日五小时生产任务者：全年交公三五○斤米，自给二○○斤米，共计五五○斤米。
    每日六小时生产任务者：全年交公四○○斤米，自给二五○斤米，共计六五○斤米。
    每日七小时生产任务者：全年交公四五○斤米，自给三○○斤米，共计七五○斤米。
    每日八小时生产任务者：全年交公五○○斤米，自给三五○斤米，共计八五○斤米。
    四、在不妨害工作并在自愿方式下，可以实行变工互助或代耕任务。节约的积极意义即是生产，除被服、余粮及津贴三项另行规定节约办法外，其他节约均可合计在生产任务内。但原则上我们不强调消极的节约、生利、营利，而强调积极的以劳力创造财富。
    五、机关每一同志包括机关家属在内，自订本年生产任务，必须同时订一怎样保证任务完成的具体计划，交付生产领导上会同行政及支部审查。各机关就最后核定之生产任务及生产计划，必须作出确实统计，除一面报告我们而外，一面即促成同类生产的组合，借此了解与掌握中心生产及骨干成份，以推进整个生产运动，并在这些生产组合的基础上，准备着手机关人员合作社的建立，以便更好的组织生产推销与消费节约。
    六、为适合业余经常劳动，并广泛吸引劳动力，我们提议以发展手工业为主，而以农业及杂作为副。目前有些部门已在组织纺织组，以纺织为中心而吸引业余劳动及家属生产；也有些部门，已准备发展结合自己业务或公私兼顾的生产节约，都是好的。
    七、为使这一运动开展，希望各机关行政上尽可能的帮助必需的资金、工具及设备，采取分期收缴任务，并渐次提高交任务比例数的办法。机关支部将以保证这一运动的发展为其目前中心任务，随时注意生产情绪和生产方式的推进，积极分子的培养，以及防止可能产生的各种偏向。机关支部及行政上，对个人生产成绩和生产表现，于其调动工作时或一定时期，将作为应列鉴定之一。
    八、配合个人生产运动的发展，有赖于各机关原有墙报组织的加强，围绕着这一中心任务，提出适时的口号，组织各种的报导，有效地进行宣传和鼓励。下月我们预定将作本年第一次的生产检阅，并同时检阅墙报。现时我们的要求是：坚决响应党所提出的生产节约号召，订出计划，大家动手，组织起来！
    各直属机关行政及支部应根据此通知，具体讨论布置之，此外即不另行通知。
            中央局行政处
            中直总支委会  二月五日
