    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 9th] Chiang Kai-shek disregards the lives of the people in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region and has breached the dikes to release floodwaters. Now, millions of people in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are suffering from disaster. In this freezing weather, people are displaced and suffering immensely, arousing the indignation and protest of the three million people in the Taiyue region, who are willing to fully support the rescue and relief work in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. The Taiyue Administrative Office recently sent a telegram to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office and the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on behalf of the three million people in the entire region. The original telegram stated: "Chiang Kai-shek is using the Yellow River to carry out a conspiracy to harm the people along the river in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Bohai regions. Now, millions of people have suffered disaster. The people of Taiyue resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's sinful actions and are willing to fully support the rescue and relief work of the brother region's people. We hope you will continue to work hard and fight the American-Chiang alliance to the end!"
