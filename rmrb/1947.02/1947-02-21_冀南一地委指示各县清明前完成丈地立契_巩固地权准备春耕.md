　　Jinnan, 19th of this month (report from this newspaper) - The First Prefectural Committee of Jinnan directed all counties to complete land measurement before the Qingming Festival to consolidate farmers' land rights in order to carry out spring plowing. The directive stated: In the great review of emancipation, the fruits of struggle must be thoroughly distinguished, and the masses must be mobilized to universally measure land before the Qingming Festival. According to the Yongzhi review, most of the land obtained by the poorest peasants has not yet been measured and contracted. Some only know that they have been divided several mu of land, but they cannot identify the boundaries. Some several households have jointly divided a piece of land but have not yet measured it separately. Similar situations exist in other counties. This has a great impact on spring plowing. In order to clarify land rights, so that the masses can carry out spring plowing with peace of mind, and to prepare for this spring's tax and contract transformation burden and other work, before the Qingming Festival, we should seize the opportunity to promote the masses to organize land measurement and signing of contracts. Each village should organize its forces well to ensure the completion of the task. At the time of measurement, it is also necessary to prevent the phenomenon of lavish eating and drinking and waste. The contract style can be written: "Contract signatory so-and-so, now, according to the government's land reform decree, recovers a section of land in his own village (in a certain direction), totaling × mu and × fen, for permanent cultivation... Witness: Agricultural Association Chairman so-and-so, Village Head so-and-so, agent so-and-so."

　　冀南一地委指示各县清明前完成丈地立契
    巩固地权准备春耕
    【本报冀南十九日电】一地委指示各县，要于清明节前完成丈量土地，巩固农民地权，以便进行春耕。指示称：在翻身大检查中，要彻底分清斗争果实，发动群众在清明节前普遍丈量土地。根据永智检查，赤贫农获得的土地多数还没丈量立契，有的只知分了几亩地，但认不清地界，有的几户伙分一地还没量开，其他各县亦有类似情形，这对春耕影响很大，为明确地权，使群众安心进行春耕，并为今春税契改造负担等工作做准备，在清明节前，应抓紧时机推动群众组织进行土地丈量、立契约，各村应很好组织力量，保证任务完成。在丈量时并须防止大吃大喝浪费现象，契约样式可写：“立契约人某，今依政府土地改革法令，收回自己村（某方向）地一段，计地×亩×分，永远耕种为业…………。证明人农会长某，村长某，代某。”
