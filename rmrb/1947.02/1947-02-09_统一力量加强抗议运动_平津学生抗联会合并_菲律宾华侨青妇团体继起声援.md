Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: A dispatch from Beiping on January 29th: In order to implement the movement to protest the violence of the American military in Beiping, students in Beiping and Tianjin previously established the "Joint Association of Student Groups Protesting the Violence of the American Military Stationed in China". Recently, student representatives from both cities, in order to seek closer ties and joint action to strengthen their forces, established the "Tianjin and Beiping Student Groups Joint Association Protesting the Violence of the American Military Stationed in China" in Tianjin on January 28th. As for the original organizations in the two cities, they will be changed to branches of the association.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Beiping News: The movement to protest American military violence and the stationing of troops in China has expanded overseas. Overseas Chinese youth and women's groups in the Philippines sent a telegram to the Student Self-Government Association of Yanjing University, expressing deep indignation at the violence of the American military, expressing respect for the actions of students nationwide, and expressing their willingness to fully support them. The signatories were the Philippine Overseas Chinese Youth Association, the Modern Women's Mutual Aid Association, and the Women's Literature and Art Research Society.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Beiping News: Xiang Da, a professor in the History Department of Peking University, gave a talk to the "Yanjing News" reporter on the 21st of last month on the violence of the American military in Beiping and Marshall's statement on leaving China, believing that the violence of the American military was due to the presence of American troops in China, and the American troops were invited by the government (referring to the Chiang government), which is obviously a political issue. When discussing Marshall's statement on leaving China, Xiang said: His statement believes that the Chinese civil war is the intention of a few military leaders of the Kuomintang, and puts "Chairman Chiang" on a very high pedestal, which is infinitely mysterious. If "Chairman Chiang" sincerely loves peace, then whether his military leaders can continue to fight becomes a problem. Therefore, people estimate that Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State may more actively assist the Kuomintang in carrying out the civil war.

    统一力量加强抗议运动
    平津学生抗联会合并
    菲律宾华侨青妇团体继起声援
    【新华社延安四日电】一月二十九日北平讯：北平、天津学生前为贯彻抗议北平美军暴行运动，曾分别成立“学生团体抗议驻华美军暴行联合会”，最近两地学生代表为谋密切联系共同行动以加强力量起见，已于一月二十八日在津成立“平津学生团体抗议驻华美军暴行联合会”。至于两地原有之组织，则改为该会之分会。
    【新华社延安四日电】北平讯：抗议美军暴行及驻华运动已扩展海外。菲律宾华侨青年及妇女团体特电燕大学生自治会，表示对美军暴行深表愤慨，对全国学生行动表示敬意，并愿全力支持。署名者为菲律宾华侨青年会、现代妇女互助会、妇女文艺研究社等。
    【新华社延安四日电】北平讯：北大历史系教授向达于上月二十一日就北平美军暴行及马歇尔离华声明对“燕京新闻”记者发表谈话，认为此次美军暴行是由于有了美军驻华，美军驻华是政府（指蒋政府）邀请来的，显然这是政治问题。向氏在论及马歇尔离华声明时称：他的声明以为中国的内战是国民党少数军事领袖的意思，而把“蒋主席”弄得高高的，这里面奥妙无穷。假若“蒋主席”真心爱和平，那末他部下的军事领袖能否继续打下去就成了问题。因此，人民估计马歇尔出任国务卿，可能更积极援助国民党进行内战。
