　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that the London Palestine Conference, which began on January 27th, ended without result and adjourned on the 14th. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, representing the British government, notified the Arab representatives at the final meeting on that day that Britain had decided to submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations. The above notification has also been delivered to Jewish leaders currently in London but who did not attend the meeting. The failure of the conference was due to widely divergent opinions between the British side and the Arab representatives. The British plan was roughly as follows: (1) Palestine would be divided into four districts under British trusteeship. (2) In the next twenty-five years, 100,000 Jews would be allowed to immigrate into the Jewish autonomous region. (3) A semi-autonomous Arab-Jewish administrative committee would be established to handle administrative affairs throughout the territory. (4) Palestine would be granted independence after five years. The Arab representatives advocated: (1) Immediate declaration of Palestine as an independent state. (2) Cessation of all Jewish immigration into Palestine. (3) Palestine must be a unified country. The United States was very concerned about this conference. Marshall reiterated his support for the immigration of 100,000 Jews into Palestine, but former Secretary of State Byrnes severely criticized the Truman administration's Palestine policy on the 10th as "disregarding the interests of the Palestinian people in solving the problem." Former Interior Secretary Ickes also criticized the United States' policy on Palestine as "completely impossible." After Bevin announced that he would submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations, the American executive member of the Jewish Agency in New York, Newman, stated that he opposed the British move. The Associated Press reported that many observers in the United States believe that this move will allow other countries besides Britain and the United States, which have not yet intervened in this issue, to intervene. Agence France-Presse reported: Well-informed sources in Lake Success emphasized that "with Britain's decision, the United States will find itself in a difficult position."

　　英美帝国主义政策失败
    巴勒斯坦会议无结果
    阿拉伯人要求真正独立
    【新华社延安十七日电】综合各方报导：于上月廿七日开始的伦敦巴勒斯坦会议，已于十四日无结果而散。英外相贝文代表英政府于是日最后一次会议上，通知阿拉伯代表称：英国已决定将巴勒斯坦问题，提交联合国。上项通知，同时亦已交付现在伦敦但未出席会议之犹太人领袖。会议之无结果，乃因英方与阿拉伯代表间意见，大相迳庭。英方计划大致为：（一）巴勒斯坦在英国托管之下为分四区。（二）在今后二十五年内，犹太人可有十万名移入犹太自治区。（三）设立半自治性之阿犹行政委员会，处理全境行政事务。（四）五年后允巴勒斯坦独立。阿拉伯代表则主张：（一）立即宣布巴勒斯坦为独立国。（二）停止一切犹太人移入巴境。（三）巴勒斯坦必须为一统一国家。美国对此次会议甚为关切，马歇尔曾重申支持十万犹太人移入巴境之意见，但前国务卿贝尔纳斯则于十日痛斥杜鲁门政府的巴勒斯坦政策为：“在解决问题上，毫不顾及巴勒斯坦人民的利益”。而前内长伊克斯亦指摘美国对巴勒斯坦政策为“完全不可能”。在贝文宣布将把巴勒斯坦问题提交联合国后，现在纽约之犹太事务局之美籍执委犹门声明，反对英国此举。合众社报导：美国许多观察家认为此举，将使迄今尚未过问，这一问题的英美以外的其他国家，亦将过问。法新闻社报导：成功湖消息灵通人士，强调说：“随着英国的决定而来的，美国将发觉自己陷于困难的地位中”。
