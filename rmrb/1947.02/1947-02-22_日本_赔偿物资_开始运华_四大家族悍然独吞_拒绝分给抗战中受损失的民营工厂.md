　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. According to various reports, the Japanese reparation goods allocated to China under the U.S. "Pauley Reparations Plan," which was not agreed upon by all relevant Allied countries, have now begun to be dismantled and shipped to China. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on January 15th and 18th, of the four million tons of Japanese reparation equipment to China, the first batch of over 590,000 tons to be dismantled and shipped includes 140,000 tons of machine tools, 50,000 tons of shipbuilding machines, 330,000 tons of steel machines, 24,000 tons of ironworking machines, 29,000 tons of power machines, and 17,000 tons of light metal tools. The Chiang government has established an monopolistic "Five-Person Receiving Committee" to go to Japan to be responsible for receiving them. Regarding the handling of these reparation goods, according to the Tianjin Yishibao on February 2nd and 6th, the Chiang government, representing the interests of the four major families, has decided to monopolize them in the name of "state-owned." For example, of the thousands of machines that should have been distributed to privately-owned factories that suffered losses due to Japanese aggression, the Chiang government, using the excuse that "the machine industry should not be decentralized," refused to allocate them and decided to use these machines to establish factories under the "government." It only allows private factory owners to participate as "joint directors." The industrial sector has requested the Executive Yuan to send representatives to Japan to understand the situation of the reparation goods, but this has not been permitted.

　　日本“赔偿物资”开始运华
    四大家族悍然独吞
    拒绝分给抗战中受损失的民营工厂
    【新华社延安廿日电】据各方报导，按照未经各有关盟国同意之美国“鲍来赔偿计划”分配予中国之日本赔偿物资，现已开始拆迁运华。据一月十五日、十八日天津大公报载称：日本对我赔偿器材的四百万吨，首批即将拆迁运来之五十九万余吨中，包括工具机十四万吨、造船机五万吨、钢铁机三十三万余吨、铁工机二万四千吨、电力机二万九千吨、轻金属工具一万七千吨，蒋政府已成立独占性的“五人接收委员会”赴日负责接收。关于此种赔偿物资之处理，据二月二日、六日天津益世报消息，代表四大家族利益之蒋政府已确定以“国营”名义加以独占。例如其机器千部原应分予因日本侵略损失之民营工厂，蒋政府却以“机器工业不宜分散”为借口，拒绝配给，决定由“政府”利用此机器设立工厂。仅许民间厂主参加任“联东”，工业界曾向行政院要求派代表赴日，了解赔偿物资情形，亦不被允许。
