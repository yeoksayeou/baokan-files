Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: According to a Taiwan dispatch in the Nanjing Dagang Bao on the 4th of last month, most factories in Taiwan have ceased operations since Taiwan's recovery. A large number of workers have lost their jobs. In addition, with the downsizing of government agencies and an increasing number of people returning to their hometowns from other provinces, the unemployment problem has become even more serious. Because unemployed Taiwanese compatriots cannot solve their livelihood problems and social order is greatly affected, robbery cases are increasing day by day.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: According to a report in the Tianjin Dagong Bao on the 1st, the current situation in Shenyang under the rule of the Chiang government is as follows: All major factories in Shenyang have closed down, a large number of workers have lost their jobs, the coal shortage is severe, and the poor cannot make a living, forcing many to take risks. Robbery cases occur every day.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: According to a dispatch from the Dasha office of the Tianjin Yishi Bao on the 29th of last month, the Daqing Mining Area, located on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces and famous for producing tungsten and tin, is currently under the control and monopoly of the Chiang clique's bureaucratic capital Resources Committee and is facing a crisis of production shrinking and workers changing professions. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 40,000 miners in the area, producing 1,600 dan of tin ore and 100 dan of tungsten ore per day. Currently, there are only 1,600 miners left, producing less than 200 dan of tin ore and only 2 dan of tungsten ore per day. The reason for the current production decline is that production costs have increased, while the purchase price of the "Resources Committee" is too low and cannot keep up with the price index.

    官僚资本统制垄断
    蒋区工厂倒闭成风
    台湾沈阳大批工人失业
    【新华社延安九日电】据上月四日南京大刚报台湾通讯称：台湾光复后，工厂大半停工。大量工人失业，加以机关裁员，省外回籍者日多，失业问题更形严重。因失业台胞生活无法解决、社会秩序大受影响，抢劫案件日益增多。
    【新华社延安九日电】据一日天津大公报报导：蒋政府统治下的沈阳近况称：沈阳各大工厂全数停闭，工人大量失业，煤荒严重，贫民无法生活，被逼走险者日众，每日都有抢案。
    【新华社延安九日电】据上月二十九日天津益世报大厦通讯透露：位于粤赣边境以出产钨、锡著名的大庆矿区，目前在蒋记官僚资本资源委员会统制垄断下，正陷于生产萎缩，工人纷纷转业的危机中。抗战前，该区共有矿工四万余名，日产锡矿一千六百担，钨矿一百担。目前则仅剩矿工一千六百名，每日产锡矿不到二百担，钨矿不过二担。目前生产萎缩原因为生产成本提高，而“资委会”收购价格过低，不能与物价指数相适应。
