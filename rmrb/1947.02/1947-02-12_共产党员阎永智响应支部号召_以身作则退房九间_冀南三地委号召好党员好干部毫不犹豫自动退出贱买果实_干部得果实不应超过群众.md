Communist Party Member Yan Yongzhi Responds to Branch Call
    Takes the Lead in Returning Nine Rooms

    Jinnan Third District Committee Calls on Good Party Members and Good Cadres to Unhesitatingly and Voluntarily Return Cheaply Bought Fruits of Struggle
    Cadres Should Not Obtain More Fruits Than the Masses

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch] In the land reform movement throughout Taiyue, many cadres have voluntarily returned excess gains and conducted self-criticism, improving cadre-mass relations. At the beginning of the land redistribution in Tongshan Town, Yuanqu County, it seemed that the cadres would have to be "operated on" first. After the cadres conducted self-criticism, some people said, "If cadres are corrupt and selfish, it's like a useful stick has bent. We must straighten it. Once, twice, three times. We can't just break it in two because it's bent." After discussion, the masses' thinking was cleared, prejudices were eliminated, and relations between the two sides became close. Forces were then concentrated on the struggle against the landlords. At the "family affairs meeting" in Nanzhang Town, Changzi County, cadres reflected and voluntarily returned excess gains, which greatly satisfied the masses. Someone said, "As long as you can examine yourselves, what can't we get over?" In Shijialing, Yangcheng County, cadres' excess gains aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, who said, "Those with good land get good land again. What are we going to use to fill our holes?" "Those with houses get houses again. Our children have nowhere to live when they get married, so they have to 'live in the wild.'" The village branch immediately held a meeting to discuss this, first conducting self-examination from the perspective of serving the masses and calling on cadres and Party members to compare themselves with the masses. The fruits gained must not exceed those of the masses. After the cadres' thinking was cleared, they conducted public self-criticism at the mass meeting. Communist Party member Yan Yongzhi took the lead by example, returning nine rooms of excess gained houses. Then, an elementary school teacher returned four mu of land. The masses applauded and welcomed this. Other cadres also returned excess houses and land one after another.

[This newspaper, Qin County dispatch] In Dongzhuang Village, Third District of Qin County, in the first stage of the in-depth winter campaign, most of the masses were not enthusiastic. The leadership discovered that the masses had opinions about the cadres. However, the cadres were afraid of losing face, afraid of being sanctioned by the higher authorities, and afraid of being struggled against by the masses, so they were unwilling to examine themselves. The leadership immediately gave a guarantee: as long as they reformed, they would not be punished. They clarified their thinking by saying, "Admitting mistakes and correcting mistakes is not shameful. Not correcting is shameful." In addition, a meeting was held with twenty people who had opinions about the cadres, allowing everyone to express their opinions as much as possible. After the opinions were raised and discussed, everyone unanimously realized that although the cadres had made mistakes in the past, as long as they could admit and correct their mistakes, we should forgive them. After each person examined themselves and discussed, the cadres made a sincere self-examination to the masses at the mass meeting, and accepted the opinions raised by the masses. In this struggle against the landlord Wei Bingjia, the cadres resolutely did not take any gains. As a result, the cadres of Dongzhuang Village became one with the masses and launched a struggle against the landlords and bullies, and the movement became a vigorous success.

[This newspaper dispatch] The Jinnan Third District Committee called on cadres at all levels to clear out and return the fruits of struggle that they had cheaply bought from the masses, and specifically stated that "good Party members and good cadres must unhesitatingly and voluntarily return what they had taken." Comrades in the land reform teams were the first to respond, bitterly recounting their past wrongdoings in groups, regretting and saying, "We were called to help the masses turn over, but we bought the fruits of the masses' struggle. We are really sorry to the masses." A comrade in Jize County slapped himself in the face in regret, "Who told you to stretch out such a long hand?" Some comrades even more bravely said, "I will send it to the masses and admit my mistakes to the masses." Comrade Dui Yongxiao said, "Our return proves that we are truly serving the people." They are all now consciously returning what they took.

    共产党员阎永智响应支部号召
    以身作则退房九间
    冀南三地委号召好党员好干部毫不犹豫自动退出贱买果实
    干部得果实不应超过群众
    【本报太岳九日电】太岳各地填平补齐运动中不少干部自动退出多得果实，并自我检讨，干群关系获得改善。垣曲同善镇填补开始时，几乎要先向干部“开刀”，经过干部自我检讨后，有人说：“干部贪污自私，好像根有用的棍子弯了，我们要把它撇直，一次，二次，三次，不能因为弯了，就一刀两断。”经过讨论，群众思想打通，消除了成见，双方关系即由此亲密，集中力量向地主斗争。长子南张镇“家务会议”上干部进行反省，自动退出了多得果实，群众很满意，有人说：“只要你能检讨出，咱还有啥过不去？”阳城史家岭干部多得果实，引起群众不满，说：“人家有好地的又得好地，咱这窟窿用啥补？”“有平房又得平房，咱娃娶媳妇就没处住，只好‘赶野外’。”该村支部即刻开会讨论，首先从为群众服务的思想上加以检讨，号召干部党员与群众比一比，所得果实一定不能超过群众，干部思想打通后，即在群众大会上当众进行自我批评。共产党员阎永智，首先以身作则，退出多得果实房九间，接着小学教员退出四亩地，群众都鼓掌欢迎。其他干部也纷纷退出多得房地。
    【本报沁县讯】沁县三区东庄村在冬季深入运动的前一段，大部群众表现不积极，领导上发觉群众对干部们有意见。但干部怕丢人、怕上级制裁、怕群众斗争，不肯检讨，领导上当即提出保证：只要改过，绝不处分。并以“承认错误、改正错误不丢人，不改才丢人”来打通其思想。另外召开二十个对干部有意见人的会议，让大家尽量提意见。提出意见讨论后，大家一致认识到：干部过去做法虽有错，但只要能认错改过，我们应该原谅他们。经过各自检讨讨论，干部们又在群众大会上向群众做了真诚的自我检讨，接受了群众提出的意见；在这次斗争地主卫炳家时，干部坚决不得果实，因此东庄村干部便与群众滚成一团，开展了向地主恶霸的斗争，运动便轰轰烈烈搞起来了。
    【本报讯】冀南三地委号召各级干部清理退还贱买群众斗争果实，并特别提出“好党员好干部要毫不犹豫的主动自觉的退出来”。翻身队同志们首起响应，在小组中痛述前非，后悔的说：“叫咱帮助群众翻身，咱买了群众斗争果实，真是对不起群众。”鸡泽一同志恨得打自己脸“谁叫你伸这么长的手。”有的同志更勇敢的说：“我给群众送去，向群众承认错误。”对永孝同志说：“咱这退还，才证明咱是真正为人民服务。”现都正在自觉的退还中。
