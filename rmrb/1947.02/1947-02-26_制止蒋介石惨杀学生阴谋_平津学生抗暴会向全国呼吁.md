　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Peiping, 10th—The Peiping-Tientsin Students' Anti-Tyranny United Association issued a letter to the nation's compatriots and students on the 9th, exposing Chiang Kai-shek's plot to massacre students and calling on the people to stop it. The original text is as follows:
    "To all compatriots and students across the country!

    The Christmas Eve incident of American soldiers raping our sisters on the street. After this unfortunate incident, our students across the country, for the sake of justice, humanity, and national dignity, risked great danger to march and demonstrate, demanding punishment of the perpetrators and withdrawal of American troops. However, our demands have not yet been met, and some people are plotting to destroy our patriotic youth.

    On February 5th, a wall poster at Peking University revealed a conspiracy to destroy patriotic youth: 'On February 4th, at 2:00 PM, at the Peiping Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, special agents such as Li × (head of the Military Statistics Bureau) announced that when the military mediation department is dissolved, they would arrest patriotic students in large numbers under the pretext of a Communist conspiracy, in order to suppress patriotic democrats across the country. Fathers and elders, students across the country! Act quickly! The special agents are already making arrangements, and as soon as the head of the special agents shouts "arrest," they will immediately take action.'

    Afterwards, this association sent someone to visit Chen Xueping, a Kuomintang member in charge of student affairs at Peking University, to clarify the truth. Chen stated that if this matter is tense, it is possible, and comprehensively considering it, it is obviously not without reason. Since the matter is directed at this association, this association cannot remain silent. Therefore, we appeal to people across the country to uphold justice and stop this shameless plot to persecute youth, and demand that the whole country strengthen unity and resolutely resist it, smash the shameless plot, and safeguard the sacred right of freedom of life; and continue to work hard to support our demand to 'change the American policy towards China' with action.

    Students across the country, unite! We can no longer allow this evil bloody hand to repeat the tragedy of killing patriotic youth!

    Compatriots across the country, roar! We must never allow the sacred freedom of the individual to be easily destroyed again!"

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to a United Press dispatch from Peiping on the 19th: Thousands of Kuomintang military police and special agents, in 30 trucks, conducted a night raid from 1:00 AM to 6:00 AM, and arrested another 16 citizens (according to reports, the Chiang authorities in Peiping had already arrested more than 300 citizens in mid-February). It has also been learned from reliable sources that since the 12th, the Peiping Chiang government authorities have dispatched a large number of military police and special agents to arrest so-called political suspects, and even Zheng Zhanting, a respected elder of Hebei province and a famous book collector over 70 years old, was arrested on the night of the 13th. Now the people of Peiping are in constant fear, shops close early at dusk, residents dare not go out, and the streets are deserted after 10:00 PM, with a terror more severe than during the enemy puppet regime.

　　制止蒋介石惨杀学生阴谋
    平津学生抗暴会向全国呼吁
    【新华社延安二十二日电】十日北平讯：平津学生抗暴联合会于九日发表告全国同胞同学书，揭露蒋介石企图惨杀学生的阴谋，并呼吁国人予以制止，原文如下：“全国同胞同学们！
    圣诞节美兵当街奸污我们的姊妹，这一不幸事件发生后，我们全国同学为了正义人道与国格，冒着很大的危险游行示威，要求惩凶及撤退美军，但是我们的要求尚未达到，又有人在阴谋摧残我们爱国青年了。
    二月五日，北大壁报有人揭发摧残爱国青年的阴谋云：‘二月四日下午两点钟，在北平国民党市党部特务李×（军统局负责人）等宣布要在军调部解散的时候，以共产党阴谋为名义大批逮捕爱国学生，借以镇压全国的爱国民主人士。全国父老们！全国同学们！赶快行动起来吧！现在特务已经在布置，只要特务头子喊一声逮捕，立刻就会动手。’
    事后本会派人访问北大训导国民党员陈雪屏氏，以求明了真象，陈氏称倘此事紧张或有可能，综合观之，显非无因。事既针对本会而发，本会自难缄默，故特呼吁全国人士主持正义，制止此种无耻迫害青年的阴谋，并要求全国加紧团结一致，坚决加以抵抗，击碎无耻阴谋，以维人生自由的神圣权利；并继续努力以行动来支持我们‘改变美国对华政策’的要求。
    全国同学们，团结起来吧！我们再不能让这罪恶的血手重演杀害爱国青年的悲剧了！
    全国同胞们，怒吼吧！我们决不能再让人身的神圣自由轻易地被摧毁了。”
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据合众社北平十九日讯：国民党军警宪特千名分乘三十辆卡车，在深夜一时至六时举行夜间大搜查，又逮捕市民十六名（按本月中旬北平蒋当局即曾逮捕市民三百余人）。另从可靠方面获悉，自十二日起，北平蒋政府当局即派大批宪警与特务大事逮捕所谓政治嫌疑犯，甚至逾七十高龄之河北耆绅名藏书家郑詹亭氏亦于十三日夜被捕去。现北平人民人人自危，商店于黄昏即提早闭市，居民不敢出户，夜间十时街道即断绝人行，恐怖惨厉甚于敌伪统治时期。
