　　 Peasants in the Fifth District of Licheng Expose Hidden Assets of Landlords
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Fifth District of Licheng is deeply engaged in the movement to dig out the "air-raid shelters" of feudal landlords. During the in-depth investigation of feudal remnants in the district, the leadership, drawing on the experience of digging "air-raid shelters" in Nanwei Spring, thoroughly exposed the landlords' conspiracy to hide materials, calling on the masses to resolutely refuse to be the landlords' "air-raid shelters." Under the conscious demands of activists, each turn-over group in Shanghuangtang utilized various relationships to help tenant farmers who had hidden property for the landlords to report themselves, and conducted in-depth investigations in mountain villages and shacks to promote their awareness and self-reporting. The Farmers' Association also established reward measures to motivate self-reporting, immediately exposing a batch of hidden assets of landlords Yang Shifu and Jiang Yuzhi, greatly boosting the morale of the peasants. In Cheyuan Village, after in-depth ideological education, the masses spontaneously exposed a large amount of materials hidden by the landlords. Many peasants who had been deceived by the landlords, after raising their awareness, actively joined the "digging air-raid shelters" movement and were rewarded by the Farmers' Association. The thorough investigation of the feudal movement throughout the district is expected to be completed before the spring plowing.
