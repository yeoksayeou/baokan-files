Sending Seven Grandsons to Join the Army
Old Man Li Honored as a Model Military Family
Leading the Masses to Overturn Their Lives
[This is a] dispatch from the Taiyue [area] to this newspaper on the 2nd. The Linfen First District held a joyous banquet for military families on the 5th. At the meeting, Old Man Li, who sent seven grandsons to join the army and actively helped the masses to overturn their lives, was selected as a model military family for the entire district. Old Mr. Li is already seventy-one years old and is a ruined middle peasant. His family farmed more than ten mu of land. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, he opened a small shop to retain people. It was not until last year when land reform was implemented that he was allocated twelve mu of flat land and six shi of grain. As early as the thirty-second year, he sent a son and a grandson to join the Taiyue Detachment, both of whom have gloriously sacrificed themselves. After turning over [the land] last year, he mobilized a son and two grandsons to join the Fourth Regiment, and one grandson to participate in local work. This time, he sent another grandson to join the county security team. He said: "One person sacrificing their life is hard for ten thousand to replace. You all go to join the army, kill more enemies to avenge your older brother and uncle." In September and October of last year, when two grandsons returned home and did not want to return to the team, he mobilized and educated them to return to the team, and instructed them: "I am already seventy years old and cannot do a good job of being loyal to the nation. It is also fulfilling filial piety at home if you can first be loyal." He also declined the preferential treatment offered to him, saying: "I rely on my shop and cultivate the land to make a living." He also does not lag behind in handing over public grain and public funds. He is a leader of the farmers' association group and enthusiastically leads the peasants to overturn their lives. If others dare not do it, he takes the lead. After Jiang’s troops occupied [the area] this time, they used knives and guns to threaten him, forcing him to call back his sons. He said: "You have come, they have all left. I will use this old life to resist. My sons cannot be called back." The stubborn Jiang troops had no choice but to release him.

    送子孙七人参军
    李老汉荣膺模范军属
    领导群众闹翻身
    【本报太岳二日电】临汾一区于五日欢宴军属。会议上选出送子孙七人参军与积极帮助群众翻身的李老汉为全区模范军属。李老先生已七十一岁，是个破落的中农，家种十余亩地，在民国二十五年又开了个留人小店，直至去年实行土地改革，才又分得了十二亩平地，六石粮食。远在三十二年，他即送一子一孙参加太岳支队，都已光荣牺牲。去年翻身后又动员了一子两孙参加了四团，一孙参加地方工作，这次又送一孙参加县保安队。他这样说：“一人舍命，万人难当，你们都去参军，多杀几个敌人为你哥哥和叔父报仇。”在去年九、十月，两个孙子回家后，不想归队，他动员教育他们归队，并叮嘱说：“我已七十岁，不能很好为民族尽忠，你们能先尽忠也顶在家尽孝”。并谢绝对他的优待说：“我靠我开店，捎带种地，也能过活。”交公粮公款也不落人后，他是个农会小组长，热情地领导农民翻身，别人不敢来干，他就带头。这次蒋军侵占后曾用刀枪威胁，强迫他叫回他的儿子，他说：“你们来了，他们都走了我就是这个老命顶着，儿子是叫不回来的。”蒋顽没奈何放了他。
