　　Beidongfang Villagers Pour Out Their Grievances
    130 Impoverished Peasant Households Rise Up
    [Our Newspaper's Report] According to correspondent Song Zhuqin, the land reform in Beidongfang Village, Linzhang, has been successfully completed. A total of 819.8 mu of land were recovered, along with 5 million yuan in currency and about 4 million yuan worth of goods. The village had 192 poor and extremely poor peasant households, with each person receiving an average of more than 2 mu of land. One hundred and thirty-one households rose to the level of middle peasants. All 134 middle peasant households participated in the movement and benefited from it. Although Beidongfang is located on the border of Linzhang, where the puppet bandits harass the area, the peasants were able to completely turn the tables because the work team correctly grasped the policy of eliminating feudalism and uniting all the peasants. According to statistics, 21 households were targeted for struggle, accounting for 5.9% of the total households. Together with the eight small landlord and rich peasant households that did not participate in the peasant association, they accounted for 7% of the total households. There were 326 households participating in the peasant association, accounting for over 91% of the total households in the village. The village experienced eight struggles from the anti-traitor liquidation in July of last year to the compensation movement in November, and the masses were fully mobilized. Peasants participated in denunciation 630 times, averaging more than two times per person, and the peasants thoroughly poured out their grievances. After the peasants rose up, the broad masses of women and children were also drawn into the upsurge of struggle. During the intense struggle after the autumn harvest, the women of the village formed a large team to collectively transport materials, and were exceptionally active. More than one-third of them participated in the denunciation. During the struggle, the Women's Federation, Sisters' Corps, and Children's Corps were simultaneously established. The village truly united more than 90% of the masses and established a patriotic united front against the puppet bandit Guo Qing. During the anti-traitor liquidation, many rich peasants and small and medium landlords, under the slogan "If traitors are not eradicated, the poor cannot turn the tables, and the rich cannot live in peace," participated in denunciation and self-defense work against bandits along with the peasants. After being liberated from the bloody rule of traitors and despots, the peasants who turned the tables composed eleven old folk songs and nine new folk songs, exposing the darkness of the old society and praising Chairman Mao for leading the people to turn the tables.
