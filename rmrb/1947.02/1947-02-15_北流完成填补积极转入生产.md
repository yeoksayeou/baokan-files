    【Our Newspaper Taihang 13th Dispatch】 Beiliu Village in Licheng has completed its land reform and has now actively transitioned to production. After more than a month of investigation and rent reduction, all poor peasants in the village have risen to the level of middle peasants, and there are no longer any extremely poor people. The peasants have all obtained the conditions for production. However, cadres and the masses generally have a sense of complacency, believing that since they have been liberated this year and have a production base from the past few years, it is not a problem to start production later. For example, Liu He said: "Spring is late this year, and I was allocated a share of livestock, so hauling manure is not a problem." After being liberated, the woman Shen Xuehua set a spinning plan of only two liang of cotton per day, thinking: "I suffered for a year last year, so I can rest this year." Some middle peasants still have the idea of "cutting chives" (i.e., being content with the status quo), such as Li Fujiang, who said: "As long as we can get by, that's enough." After reflection in the winter school, the leadership put forward the idea: "You can't rely on eating fruit to live forever, you have to rely on production to live well." Through discussion, the idleness and concerns of the middle peasants were dispelled, and the whole village actively transitioned to production. According to the principle of voluntariness, mutual aid groups were reorganized, and the cooperative also expanded its share capital by more than one million yuan in a few days. The men set a goal of delivering one-third of the manure and transporting 300 loads of coal before the end of the first lunar month. The women set a goal of weaving six jin of cloth per person per month. The cooperative is now helping the liberated households buy livestock.

    北流完成填补积极转入生产
    【本报太行十三日电】黎城北流的填补完成已转入生产。该村经过月余的查减运动，贫农全部上升中农，赤贫绝无，农民均获得了生产条件。但干部与群众中普遍存在着一种自满思想，以为今年翻了身又有几年来的生产基础，迟些搞生产是不成问题。如刘河说：“今年春迟，带分了一股牲口，搬粪不成问题”。妇女申雪花翻身后，订纺织计划每天只纺二两花，认为：“去年受了一年罪，今年可得歇一歇。”部分中农仍有割韭菜思想，如李富江说：“能过就行了。”这次在冬学反省后，领导上即提出：“光靠果实吃不到老，要想好过靠生产。”经讨论打通了空闲思想与中农顾虑，全村积极的转入了生产。按自愿原则，重新组织了互助组，合作社几天内也扩大股金一百多万元。男人订出阴历正月要送粪三分之一，运煤三百驮。妇女订出每人每月织布六斤。现合作社正帮助翻身户买牲口。
