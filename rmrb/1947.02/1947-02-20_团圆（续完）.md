　　Reunion (Conclusion)
    Zhou Jiefu
    "Amidst the laughter, Old Gao, a member of the district workers' and peasants' association, entered. Chairman Feng stood up to shake his hand as soon as he saw him: "Ah! You're here too."
    "Yes. The people elected me to the farmers' association," Old Gao replied, then asked, "Is Little Zhou still here?"
    "Which Little Zhou?"
    "That thin female comrade who speaks so well."
    "Ah, that's Thin Li (Note 5). She sacrificed herself."
    Old Gao was silent and sat on the edge of the kang corner.
    "Gao Dahu, how much land did you get?"
    "One *xiang* and three *mu*!" Gao Dahu replied. Then he turned his head and laughed to himself, saying, "The Chairman hasn't forgotten my name!"
    "And you? How much did you get?" Chairman Feng asked Old Tong.
    "More than four *xiang*. There are many people in my family." Old Tong's face was red, not knowing whether it was from shyness or from the excitement of joy.
    "And you?" Chairman Feng's gaze fell on Old Zhou's face.
    "One *xiang* and four *mu*." Old Zhou is seventy-six years old this year. He used to deliver letters in the dark and crawl around on the railway.
    "Those who had no land now have land!" This was a voice full of joy.
    "Good! Now that you have land, let the government issue a land certificate. Have us poor folks ever seen a land certificate before?"
    "How could we have!" Old Yang Tou, who was sixty-eight years old, replied. Then he turned to everyone: "Now that we have our own land, we must cultivate it well. Next year, produce more grain, eat our fill, and never suffer from hunger and bullying again."
    At this moment, a comrade from the work team brought in a letter. It was a letter from a bandit leader, requesting that the army and local armed forces not attack them, and that they were willing to surrender. After reading the letter, Chairman Feng said, "The bandits have been quite a sight to behold this year, haven't they?"
    Old Zhao, sitting on the edge of the kang, suddenly turned around and said, "Quite a sight! This past April, the bandits stripped me of all my clothes and pants and even took a horse, which cost me fifteen hundred to redeem!"
    "That kid surnamed Meng has been caught," Gao Dahu chimed in from the side.
    "Which one surnamed Meng?" Chairman Feng asked.
    "That short guy who was the district chief during the puppet Manchurian regime."
    "Oh, that bad egg who later became the police chief, where was he caught?"
    "From Harbin."
    "Chief Meng did a lot of bad things in this area. Later, send him here for a public trial. Let everyone say what should be done."
    "In my opinion, he must be shot!" Gao Dahu said fiercely.
    "No one will escape!" Chairman Feng's glasses revealed a resolute light: "Even if they run to the ends of the earth, we will bring them back!"
    "In the past, these people seemed to be shrinking in a pot, with a big stone pressing on the lid. Now that the big stone is lifted off and the lid is opened, they will all be fished out one by one." Gao Dahu's voice echoed throughout the room.
    "But don't think that just because the bandits are surrendering everywhere, there is still a big bandit leader who wants to come and rob us!" Chairman Feng said seriously: "That big bandit leader is Chiang Kai-shek! In the past, he sold out the country, selling the Northeast to the Japanese devils, making the people of the Northeast live like beasts of burden for fourteen years. Now he wants to sell the Northeast to the American imperialists again, so we all have to be careful."
    Gao Dahu snorted: "Hmph! If selling to the first daddy doesn't work, does he think selling to the second daddy will?"
    That tall, thin man who had been sitting upright on the edge of the bench stood up straight, walked to the space between the kang and the bench, and said loudly: "I say, we all contributed and fought against the Japanese in the Anti-Japanese Alliance in the past. Today, the Communist Party leading us has turned the Northeast upside down, allowing us poor boys to turn ourselves over, and take the seals of power. Whoever wants to occupy the Northeast, hey, we won't let them! We must all work more actively, those who can carry rifles carry rifles, those who can take spears take spears, the young ones protect the home, the old ones stay at home. We crawled out of blood, and we must crawl back into the blood! If the Kuomintang Central Army wants to come, we'll send a hundred people and a hundred pairs of hands to beat him; if secret agent villains want to make trouble, we'll send a hundred people with a hundred pairs of eyes to stare at him. We must maintain the glory of the past and work together with one heart!"
    The speaker was the self-defense captain of Taipinggou, named Zhang Linbao. He raised his head, the veins on his neck bulging, and struck the air with both fists. Yesterday, when he heard the news that "Old Feng" was coming, he ran to the district workers' and peasants' union in one breath, mistook someone and held the hand of a staff member from the provincial government for a long time, unable to speak, and shed large tears.
    "Do it!" Gao Dahu's iron-like voice responded.
    Chairman Feng straightened his upper body, his loud voice becoming even wider and louder: "Everyone, organize yourselves well, unite together, and take up spears, steel guns, foreign cannons, and earthen platforms. Let the Kuomintang Central Army bandits come, and we'll take care of them when they come!"
    Old Sun, Old Tong, and a few younger people's eyes lit up, as if they had heard Commander Zhao's loud battle call again.
    ...
    It was time to eat. Old Di, sitting at one end of the table, did not move his chopsticks. His eyes, covered with a layer of haze, stared intently at Chairman Feng's face. He was fifty-eight years old this year, his hearing was not good, and his body was weak, so he could no longer work in the fields, but he sent his youngest son to participate in the revolution. He said: "I am not good anymore, let the next generation continue to do it." Now he sat silently, watching without blinking, and did not answer when Chairman Feng invited him to eat.
    "Eat!" Chairman Feng greeted him a second time. He shook his head and said in a hoarse, trembling voice: "Seeing you is better than eating!"
    Drinking light wine, eating vegetarian dishes and coarse rice, around the large table, face to face, this group of old comrades of the Anti-Japanese Alliance, who had struggled through difficult and dangerous environments, experiencing more than ten years of separation and remembrance, today reunited with one of their dearest leaders - "Old Feng", in Wujimi (Note 6), the birthplace of the Anti-Japanese Alliance's Third Army!
    Note 5: Thin Li's original name was Zhao Yiman, and she was the Propaganda Minister of the Zhuhai Central County Party Committee.
    Note 6: General Zhao Shangzhi first organized armed forces in Sangu Liukou, and Sangu Liukou is a village in the Wujimi District.

　　团圆（续完）
    周洁夫
    “笑声中区工农联合会委员老高进来了，冯主席一看就起来同他握手：“呵！你也在这里。”
    “是的。大伙儿把我举到农会里了。”老高回答，接着问：“小周还在吧？”
    “哪个小周？”
    “瘦瘦的那个女同志，讲话挺漂亮的。”
    “啊，那是瘦李。（注五）她牺牲了。”
    老高默然，坐到炕角落的边上。
    “高大虎，你分了多少地，”
    “分了一垧三！”高大虎回答。随后回过头独自个儿笑说：“主席还没忘记我的名字哩！”
    “你呢？分了多少？”冯主席问老佟。
    “分了四垧多。家里人口多。”老佟的脸红了，不知道是由于羞怯还是由于喜悦的激动。
    “你呢？”冯主席的眼光落在老周的脸上。
    “一垧四亩。”老周今年七十六了。早先他曾在黑夜里送过信；在铁道上爬来爬去。
    “没有地的都有了地啦！”这是一声充满着欢愉的声音。
    “好！分了地，让政府发个地照，——咱们穷棒子从没见过地照吧？”
    “哪能见！”六十八岁的老杨头回答。然后他转脸向着大家：“咱们自己有了地，就得好生种呵。来年多打粮食，吃得饱饱的，再也不要忍饥受气了。”
    这时候，一位工作队的同志拿进来一封信，那是一股中央胡子写来的信：要求军队和地方武装不要打他们，他们愿意投降。冯主席看完信，说：“今年胡子闹得够瞧了吧？”
    坐在炕沿的老赵突然回过头来说：“够瞧！今年四月间胡子把我的衣服裤子全剥去了，还牵走一匹马，化了一千五才赎回来！”
    “姓孟的那个小子给抓住了。”高大虎从一旁插进来。
    “哪一个姓孟的？”冯主席问。
    “伪满时候当过区长的那个小个子。”
    “噢，是后来当了警察署长的那个坏东西吧，从那儿抓来的？”
    “从哈尔滨。”
    “孟署长在这一带干的坏事可不少哪。以后把他送来这里公审。让大伙说说，该怎么办就怎么办。”
    “依我说，非得把他毙了不行！”高大虎气狠狠的说。
    “一个都跑不了的！”冯主席的眼镜里透出坚决的光：“跑到天边边也得把他抓回来的！”
    “过去这帮人好像缩在锅里面，锅盖上压着个大石块。现在大石块一掀掉，锅盖一打开，一个个都得夹出来。”高大虎的声音震得满屋响。
    “不过别看胡子到处投降，还有个最大的胡子头要来打抢咱们呢！”冯主席严肃地说：“那个大胡子头就是蒋介石！过去他卖国，把东北卖给了日本鬼，让东北人民过了十四年的牛马生活。现在他又想把东北卖给美国大鼻子了，大伙儿还得留点神呢。”
    高大虎响了声鼻子：“哼！卖给第一个爸爸不能行，卖给第二个爸爸就能行啦？”
    那个一直挺坐在前排凳子边边上的瘦高个子，挺直地站起来，走到炕和凳子中间，高声说：“我说，咱们过去都在抗联出过力、打过鬼子。今天领导咱们的共产党把东北翻了个身，让穷小子们都翻了身，拿了印把子。谁要来占东北呀，嘿，谁也不让！咱们都要更积极的工作，扛大枪的扛大枪，拿扎枪的拿扎枪，年轻的保家，年老的在家，咱们从血里滚出来，还得滚到血里头去！国民党中央军要来，咱们一百人出一百双手揍他；特务坏蛋要捣乱，咱们一百个人用一百双眼睛瞪他，咱们要把过去的光荣保持起来，合伙儿齐心干！”
    说话的是太平沟的自卫队长，名叫张林保。他仰起头，颈下的青筋胀着，两个拳头打着空气。昨天他听到当“老冯”要来的消息，一气跑到区工农联合会，认错了人，握住一个从省政府来的工作人员的手久久说不出话，吊下了大颗的眼泪。
    “干！”高大虎铁一样的声音响应着。
    冯主席挺直上身，他的洪亮的声音。放得更宽更大了：“大伙儿好好组织起来，团结起来，拿起来扎枪、钢枪、洋炮、土台子，让国民党中央胡子来吧，来了就收拾他！”
    老孙、老佟，几个年纪轻一点的人眼睛都亮起来，仿佛又听到了赵司令的响亮的战斗号召。
    ……
    吃饭了。坐在桌子一端的老狄没有去动筷子，他那蒙着一层翳障的眼睛死盯着冯主席的脸孔。他今年五十八，耳朵不灵便，身体亏虚，已经不能下地，可是他送自己的小儿子参加了革命，他说：“我不行了，让下一辈子继续干吧。”现在他默默地端坐看，眼睛霎也不霎，当冯主席招呼他用饭的时候他没有回答。
    “吃饭啊！”冯主席第二次招呼他了。他摇摇头，用嘶哑的颤音说：“见了你比吃饭还强！”
    喝着淡酒，吃着素菜和粗饭，围着大桌子，面对着面，这一群抗联的老同志们从困苦艰难，出生入死的环境中斗争过来的，经过十几年的离别和怀念，今天又和最亲爱的领导人之一——“老冯”，在抗联第三军的发源地——乌吉密（注六）团圆了！
    注五：瘦李原名赵一曼，是珠河中心县委宣传部长。
    注六：赵尚志将军最先是在三股六组织武装，三股六是乌吉密区一个屯子。
