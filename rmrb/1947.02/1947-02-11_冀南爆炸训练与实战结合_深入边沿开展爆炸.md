    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch on the 9th] The Second Branch of the Southern Hebei Military Commission's explosives training class combines training with the struggle against the enemy, and is deepening the village-wide explosives campaign in the border areas. The third session of the Second Branch of the Southern Hebei Military Commission's explosives training class recently went to the border area where the four counties of En (County), Gao (Tang), Ping (Yuan), and Xia (Jin) meet, to conduct small-scale training and to widely launch the explosives campaign. After learning, Wang Shizhai filled the village entrances and road intersections with landmines. On the night of the 15th, the enemy's XX unit went to the village. Before entering the village, they stepped on two landmines, and the enemy was so frightened that they ran back, retreating to a certain graveyard to gather. With a loud bang, another landmine exploded under the enemy's feet, and the enemy had to flee in panic, carrying the wounded. This practically educated the masses of each village to learn how to lay landmines and to launch a mass explosives campaign. In carrying out the explosives work, the Second Branch of the Southern Hebei Military Commission did not limit the explosions to one place, but rather spread the flames of explosions to the several counties of Pingyuan, Xiajin, Enxian, and Gaotang. It quickly developed from points to areas. The Military Commission specifically calls on all localities to learn from this practice of combining explosives training with actual explosives. "One person teaches several people, several people teach everyone, develop explosions from one village to explosions in several villages, and develop explosions in several villages to explosions in every village."

    冀南爆炸训练与实战结合
    深入边沿开展爆炸
    【本报威县九日电】武委二分会爆炸训练班训练与对敌斗争结合，深入边沿区开展遍村爆炸运动。武委二分会爆炸训练班第三期顷至边沿区恩（县）、高（唐）、平（原）、夏（津）四县交界处，进行小型训练，并普遍展开爆炸运动。王士砦学会后便将村边口、道口埋满了地雷。十五号晚敌××部到该村去。未进村就踏响了两个地雷，敌人吓得各自回跑，退到某坟地集合，轰然一声，再个地雷在敌人脚下又开了花，敌只得带着炸伤的彩号，狼狈逃窜。实际教育了各村群众学会下地雷，开展群众性的爆炸运动。武委二分会在开展爆炸工作中，没把爆炸局限在一个地方，而是把爆炸的烽火燃遍平原、夏津、恩县、高唐几个县。很快地从点开展到面。武委总会特号召各地学习这种把训练爆炸与实际爆炸结合起来。“一人教会数人，数人教会人人，开展一村爆炸到数村爆炸，开展数村爆弹到遍村爆炸”的作法。
