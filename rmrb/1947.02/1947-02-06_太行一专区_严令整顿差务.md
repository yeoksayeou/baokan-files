Taihang First Special District

Strictly Orders Rectification of Corvée Labor

[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch of the 2nd] With spring plowing imminent, the First Special Commissioner's Office, the Military Sub-district Command, and the Armed Forces Committee have jointly issued an order to rectify corvée labor. Prior to this, the First Special Commissioner's Office conducted investigations in six villages, including Shicheng Village in Lincheng, Northeast Village in Yuanshi, and Nanguan in Zanhuang, and found that corvée labor laws were not strictly enforced, resulting in an uneven burden of corvée labor on the people. For example, in Northeast Village, only 58 out of 105 eligible male laborers performed corvée labor, and in Shicheng Village, only one-third of the eligible population performed corvée labor. Village cadres, militiamen, and even union members were arbitrarily exempted from corvée labor. If this is not rectified, it will not only seriously affect production but also affect military corvée labor. To this end, the order stipulates that: except for the village chief, chairman of the farmers' association, political director, director of the Armed Forces Committee, head of the corvée station, and managers and accountants of cooperatives and state-owned stores, no one is allowed to be exempted from corvée labor. Cadres attending meetings or receiving training, and militiamen undergoing training or going on operations, can be substituted for corvée labor (during the busy farming season, operations can be substituted for work in mutual aid teams). Businessmen perform short corvée labor, and professional craftsmen perform half corvée labor. When political and civilian organs or rear-area military organs move, and when military personnel carry loads not exceeding thirty catties, the troops are not allowed to use corvée labor for tasks such as cutting grass and cooking. Establish military reception stations in villages along major roads, with cadres taking turns on duty, and abolish the practice of hiring servants. Strictly implement the regulations for allocating corvée labor, and districts and villages have no right to arbitrarily allocate corvée labor. Except for duties of a combat nature and transporting goods for the military, the corvée wages paid by the troops are stipulated at 45 liang of millet per person per day. Donkey and cattle feed is seven catties, and mule and horse feed is eight catties.

    太行一专区
    严令整顿差务
    【本报太行二日电】春耕在即，一专署及分区司令部，武委会特联合发布整顿差务命令。事前一专署曾就临城石城村、元氏东北村及赞皇南关等六村调查，发现支差法令未被严格执行，致人民差务负担畸轻畸重。如东北村适龄男劳力百零五人中仅五十八人支差，石城村支差者仅占适龄人数三分之一，村中干部、民兵甚至工会会员均任意免差。如不加以整顿，不仅严重影响生产，且将影响军差。为此命令中规定：除村长、农会主席、政治主任、武委会主任、差站长、合作社与公营商店的经理、会计外，一律不准免差，干部开会、受训，民兵整训、出击等可顶差（农忙时出击可在互助组中顶工）。商人支短差，专业手艺工人支半差。政民机关、后方部队机关搬家，行军负重不超过三十斤者，部队驻防切草做饭等杂务均不准用差。沿大路村庄设行军招待所，干部轮流值日，取消听差办法。严格执行拨差规定，区村无权任意拨差。除参战性质之勤务及运送劳军物品外，部队用差发给之差价规定为每人每日小米四十五两。驴牛料七斤，骡马八斤。
