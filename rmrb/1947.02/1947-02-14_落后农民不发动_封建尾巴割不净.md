If backward peasants are not mobilized, feudal remnants cannot be eradicated.

Therefore, in the in-depth stage, there must be no complacency. Continue to repeatedly investigate landlords. Not only must we check from an economic perspective whether they are still hiding or disguising excessive land and property, but also from a political perspective, whether they have truly bowed their heads to the peasants, whether they are still deceiving and intimidating the masses, or engaging in other reactionary behaviors, etc. Feudal landlords often use backward peasants to conceal their feudal remnants. While investigating landlords, we must also conduct in-depth inspections, discover backwardness, and mobilize backwardness to completely eliminate the air raid shelters of feudal landlords. Check what problems still exist within the peasantry and solve them in a timely manner. Resolutely purge from the ranks of cadres those treacherous and opportunistic elements who back the landlords.

    封建尾巴割不净
    因此在深入阶段中，丝毫不能再有自满思想，继续反复清查地主，不但要从经济上检查其是否还隐藏或变相隐藏过多土地资财，还要从政治上检查其是否真正向农民低头，是否还在继续欺骗威吓群众，或其他反动行为等等。封建地主常利用落后农民掩藏其封建尾巴，与清查地主同时必须深入检查，发现落后，发动落后，彻底消灭封建地主的防空洞，检查农民内部还有什么问题，以及时解决，在干部中坚决清洗背靠地主的奸细投机分子。
