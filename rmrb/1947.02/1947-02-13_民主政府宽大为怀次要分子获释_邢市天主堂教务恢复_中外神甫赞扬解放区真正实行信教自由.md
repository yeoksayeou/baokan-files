[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After the Xingtai City Catholic Church spy case was cracked, and after reasonable handling by the government and the masses, church affairs have now fully resumed. The criminals Ge Lecai, the spy ringleaders Lang Benren, Qiao Zhiyi, and Jin Lanying, due to their serious crimes, are still being held by the municipal government for continued education. The remaining minor accomplices have been released. Four Polish priests, Jia Jingduo, Lei Mingxia, Yang Baolu, and Cai Wenjie, are responsible for reorganizing church affairs.

In addition to colluding with Japanese invaders, harboring traitors, organizing espionage activities, and disregarding human life, Ge Lecai and others extorted 120 million yuan in land and property from the masses. Ge and others acknowledged that even if all the property of the Catholic Church, valued at 340 million yuan, was used to compensate the victims, it would still fall far short. However, the people of Xingtai City showed leniency and magnanimity. In order to allow the church to continue its religious affairs, they specifically allocated the North Changjie Cathedral and four courtyards of houses, totaling more than 130 rooms, from the real estate that had already been compensated to the masses, allowing the church to continue preaching. Their personal clothing, property, and all equipment were left untouched, and the Joseph Society Sisters' Convent, the Charity Association, and the Infant Asylum established by the church were provided with grain, vegetable gardens, and spinning wheels, looms and other production tools. The church's Bibles and religious rituals were also all given to them. All Chinese and foreign priests and clergy were extremely grateful for this.

When Jia Jingduo and others returned to the church and saw that all the religious objects—altars, incense burners, candlesticks, kneeling benches, organs, Bibles, and portraits—were intact, they were overjoyed and repeatedly praised the masses, saying, "The democratic government and the masses truly advocate religious freedom and show meticulous care and concern for our church." When the masses also returned more than twenty boxes of ritual clothing, they were even more delighted and overjoyed, saying, "These things have all been compensated to the masses, and they are not things we should get back. Now the masses care for us and leave these things for us, we are too grateful."

Father Qin Baoji, a doctor at the Catholic Hospital, even cheerfully said to everyone, "The masses are only struggling against war criminals; they are not struggling against missionaries, let alone specifically struggling against foreigners. Otherwise, I am also a missionary, a Pole. Why aren't the masses struggling against me?"

The church has now been completely tidied up, and normal operations have resumed a few days ago, with Mass being offered as usual. (Xi Min)

    【本报特讯】邢台市天主堂特务案件破获后，经过政府与群众的合理处理，现教务已全部恢复。罪惩葛乐才、特务首脑郎本仁、乔志义及金兰英等四人因罪恶重大，尚留市府继续进行教育，其余次要分子均已释放，贾景铎、雷鸣夏、杨保禄、蔡文杰等四位波兰籍神父正负责整顿教务。葛乐才等除勾结日寇包庇汉奸、组织特务、草菅人命等罪行外，曾敲诈勒索群众土地财物十二万万元，葛等自认以天主堂全部财产作价三万万四千余万元赔偿受害群众，尚相差极远。但邢市群众宽大为怀，为使该堂继续进行教务，特从已赔偿群众的房产中拨出北长街大教堂及房屋四院，共一百三十余间，让该堂继续传教。彼等个人所有的服装、财物及全部用具均分毫未动，并发给该堂所设之若瑟会修女院，仁爱会，婴儿院以粮食、菜园及纺花车、织布机等生产工具。教堂的圣经和宗教祭仪，亦全部给予他们。所有中外籍神甫、教士对此感激异常。贾景铎等回到教堂看见所有宗教祭品——供桌、香炉、蜡台、跪凳，风琴、圣经、挂像等均完好如故，无不喜形于色，并向群众一再称赞说：“民主政府和群众真正是主张信教自由，对我们教会的爱护关照备至。”当群众将二十余箱祭仪服装亦全部交还时，他们更是高兴万分，喜出望外，连说：“这些东西全都赔偿群众了，不是我们应该再得的东西，现在群众爱护我们，把这些东西留给我们，我们太感谢了。”公教医院的医生秦报吉神甫更愉快的向大家说：“群众只是斗争战争罪犯，既不是斗争传教士，更不是专斗外国人，不然，我也是传教士，波兰人，群众为啥不斗我呢？”现教堂已全部整理就绪，并已于日前恢复常态，照旧跪弥撒。（西民）
