　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. According to a Shanghai dispatch by TASS on the 13th, quoting Shanghai newspapers: The Shanghai Student Federation issued a declaration on the 11th, forcefully stating: "We demand that all US troops immediately withdraw from China, and we demand that the United States immediately and fundamentally abandon its shameful policy of turning China into a colony."

    Xinhua News Agency, 15th. According to the Shanghai Wenhui Bao on the 15th of last month: The Shanghai Student United Association Against US Military Atrocities has decided to establish contact with progressive organizations abroad. Fudan University and Jinan University drafted letters to the Paris World Youth Congress, the American Far Eastern Policy Association, the American Federation of Free Workers, and Major General Carlson. The content included a statement of the association's propositions and a compilation of records of US military atrocities in China over the past year and a half.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. According to a Beiping dispatch on the 7th: The Beiping-Tianjin Student Groups United Association Against US Military Presence in China, issued a statement on the 6th regarding the US government's announcement of its withdrawal from the Executive Headquarters, pointing out that the US withdrawal from the Executive Headquarters was the inevitable result of the US superficially acting as a mediator while secretly funding one side in carrying out the civil war. The US military's mission of repatriating prisoners has long been completed, and the Executive Headquarters has also been dissolved. China's sovereignty and independence must not be violated. The US military has no reason to remain in China any longer, and demands the complete withdrawal of US troops stationed in China. The American policy of turning China into a colony must be changed. Only in this way can China's sovereignty be independent and Sino-US friendship be maintained.

　　上海学联号召扩大爱国运动
    要求美军全部离华
    【新华社延安十五日电】据塔斯社上海十三日电引沪报消息：上海学生联合会，十一日发表宣言力称：“我们要求美军全部立即从中国撤退，我们要求美国立即根本抛弃其可耻的变中国为殖民地的政策。”宣言号召反抗美国支持扩大中国内战的政策，反抗美国对中国的经济侵略，呼吁加强扩大爱国运动，并且要求停止内战，重建和平。
    【新华社十五日电】据上月十五日上海文汇报讯：上海学生抗议美军暴行联合会，决定与国外各进步团体取得联系。由复大及暨大草拟致巴黎世界青年大会、美国远东政策协会、美国自由工作者协会及卡尔逊少将函件，内容除声明该会主张外，并汇录一年半来美军在华暴行纪录。
    【新华社延安十五日电】据北平七日讯：平津学生团体抗议美军驻华暴行联合会，为美国政府宣布退出军调部于六日发表声明，指出美方退出军调部，为美国表面充作调人暗中资助一方进行内战的必然结果。美军遣俘任务早已完成，军调部又告解散，中国主权独立不容侵犯，美军已无再留中国之理由，要求全部撤离在华美军，美国变中国为殖民地的政策，必须改变。只有这样，中国的主权才能独立，中美的友谊才能维持。
