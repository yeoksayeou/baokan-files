    Jinnan Eleventh Military Sub-district successfully tested a water mine. After placing the mine in the middle of the Fuyang River, as soon as a pair ignited it, with a "boom," the river water burst in all directions, splashing over the riverbank by more than 5 zhang (approximately 16.7 meters), and houses half a li (approximately 250 meters) away shook. Everyone was extremely excited upon seeing this. The captain said, "If Chiang's army dares to attack, we will make sure they can't travel by land or water, and they will hit mines everywhere." Currently, the explosion team has researched six types of mines: stepping mines, wading mines, pull mines, flip hand grenades, and water mines. The team members have all learned techniques for making explosives and detonators, and will soon go to the front lines to cooperate with the main force in combat.

    冀南十一分区试验水雷成功
    【本报讯】冀南十一分区爆炸队于滏阳河中试验水雷。将雷下在河当中后，一对引火轰的一声，河水四面开花，水溅出河堤五丈多远，距半里远的房屋被震的动荡，大家看了异常兴奋。队长说：“蒋军敢来进攻我们就叫他水陆不能走，到处撞雷。”现爆炸队已研究出踏雷、趟雷、拉雷、翻手雷、水雷等六种雷，队员都学会了制药、制雷管等技术，不日即赶赴前方配合主力军作战。
