　　Wuxiang People Immerse Themselves in Construction, Facilitating Smooth Trade Between Wudong and Wuxi;
    Tens of Thousands Gather to Celebrate the Completion of the Guanhe Bridge
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, 28th] The Guanhe Bridge, five li west of Wuxiang city, was completed before the New Year. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, over ten thousand people from all walks of life in the county gathered to celebrate, their spirits high. The Guanhe River is a tributary of the Zhuotong River. It freezes in winter and swells rapidly in summer, posing a major obstacle to transportation. This prevented coal produced in Wudong from being supplied to Wuxi and Qin County. The riverbed is sandy, making it impossible to build a bridge even in winter. A stone bridge was built before the War of Resistance, but it was washed away soon after completion. This time, County Magistrate Li Yutian and the Construction Department personally planned and led the construction, employing over seven thousand workers. It took three months of effort to complete. The bridge is over twenty zhang long, over one zhang wide, and two zhang high. The bridge foundation and bridge beams are all made of steel, with iron pillars sunk more than two zhang and five chi into the sandy bottom, making it exceptionally strong. From now on, trade between east and west will be smooth, the coal industry in Wudong will develop, and the fuel problem in the Wuxi area will also be solved. The inscription "Great Achievement of the People of Wuxiang" is engraved on the bridgehead to commemorate this. According to County Magistrate Li, after the bridge is completed, the million yuan construction cost can be recovered through mass transportation over one winter.

　　武乡人民埋头建设武东武西商运畅通
    万人集会庆祝关河大桥竣工
    【本报太行二十八日电】武乡城西五里之关河大桥已于年前竣工。旧历元旦该县各界万余人集会庆祝，情绪热烈。关河为浊潼支流之一，冬季结冰，夏季猛涨成为交通上一大障碍。致武东所产之煤，无法供给武西及沁县等地。该河河床为沙底，冬季亦无法搭桥。抗战前曾建石桥一次，修成不久即被冲毁。此次建桥由该县县长李玉田及建设科亲自筹划领导，用工七千余，经三月努力始成。桥长二十余丈，宽丈余，高两丈。桥基桥梁全用钢骨，铁柱深入沙底二丈五尺以上，坚固异常。从此东西商运畅通，武东煤业发展，武西一带燃料问题亦解决。该桥桥头刻有“武乡人民伟大成就”八个大字，以示纪念。据李县长谈：桥成后，百万元建桥费，经群众一冬运输，即可收回。
