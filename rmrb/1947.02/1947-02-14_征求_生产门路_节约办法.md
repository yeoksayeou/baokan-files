    Seeking
    Production Avenues
    Economy Measures
    Currently, all organizations are enthusiastically responding to Comrade Bo Yibo's call to increase production and practice economy to welcome the dawn, and are actively carrying out production and economy work. In order to meet the readers' demands, this column wants to introduce some specific methods for increasing production and practicing economy, but it is impossible for one organization or a few people to do this well. Therefore, we are soliciting some production avenues and economy measures, hoping that everyone will actively respond as soon as possible. The following are three proposed topics:
    I. Do you know of any production avenues that are suitable for staff to adopt? What are the specific methods?
    II. Please introduce an effective economy measure.
    III. Does your organization or nearby area have any work that needs help (such as the supply department needing people to dismantle and wash clothes, etc.)? If so, please tell us how to contact them and how many people are needed? We are willing to make introductions on your behalf.
    When replying, please specify the specific conditions for implementing this production and economy measure (such as business, funds, raw materials, tools, manpower, time, sales channels, etc.).

专栏：

    征求
    生产门路
    节约办法
    目前各机关都在热烈响应薄一波同志生产节约迎接光明的号召，积极进行生产节约工作。本栏为了适应读者要求，想介绍一些生产节约的具体办法，但一个机关或少数人是无法作好这件事的，特来征求一些生产门路和节约办法，希望大家踊跃应征，越快越好。兹拟三个题目如下：
    一、你知道有什么生产的门路，可以适合机关工作人员采用？具体怎样作法？
    二、请介绍一种行之有效的节约办法。
    三、你的机关或附近地区有些什么需要帮工的工作可做（如供给部门需要拆洗衣服的人手等）？如有，请告诉我们怎样接洽，需多少人？我们愿代介绍。
    在答复时请说明实行这个生产节约办法的具体条件（如业务、资金、原料、工具、人力、时间、销路等）。
