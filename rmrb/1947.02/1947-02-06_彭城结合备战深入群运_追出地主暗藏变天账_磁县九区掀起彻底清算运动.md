    [This Newspaper, Magnetic Hill News] Here, the Pengcheng masses, through war preparation inspections, discovered that treacherous despotic landlords were spreading rumors to counterattack. Workers, peasants, and urban residents united to launch a renewed and thorough struggle against landlords who had not yet bowed their heads, unearthing hidden "regime change accounts" and concealed weapons and documents. Last winter, when the masses were busy preparing for war, the daughter of landlord Wang Mingtang said, "Whoever struggles against my family relies on my family for sustenance! The Central Army will come to take revenge!" After the leadership discovered the landlords' counterattack activities in the war preparation, they immediately conducted education in the worker branches to overcome complacency and united with urban residents to first launch a struggle against Niu Minglun, a traitor and landlord on Xinhua Street. They unearthed Niu's concealed eight-sound gun, and he confessed to plotting to shoot citizens in the dark to retaliate. Following this, the village of Hequan unearthed a large batch of red documents buried very securely by landlord Wang Laoxiu. The village of Lianhe exposed the "regime change account" of stubborn landlord Chai Shichang. He admitted that he had a friend in the Central Army, and he wrote down the names of everyone who struggled against him, waiting for the Central Army to come and retaliate. Wang Mingtang's daughter, under pressure from the masses, confessed that she was colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's agent Zhang × to carry out rumor-mongering and deceptive propaganda. After a thorough investigation of the streets, over ten days, one hundred documents, over one hundred packages, four mules, and many silver foreign ornaments were found. During the struggle, the masses' awareness was greatly enhanced, and they unanimously demanded resolutely overthrowing Little Chiang and thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants. (Serving Labor)
    [This Newspaper, Taihang, 3rd dispatch] Magnetic Hill No. 9 District, in conjunction with war preparations, deeply mobilized the masses. Due to insufficient boldness and lack of ideological mobilization by the leadership during last year's movement, the landlords were not truly defeated. For example, Zhou Yi, a major traitor in Quanjou Village, still controls village administration and has not been liquidated. Landlords in Changning Village instigated their henchmen to detain the activist Wang Qin, undermining the masses' liberation. Last year, after the masses liquidated the major traitor and miser Xian Zhang in Shiqiao Village and took back some of the fruits from his house, he often threatened the masses, saying, "This table is mine, don't damage it. If you live in my house, you will have to pay rent in the future." The broad masses' ideological concerns (mainly the idea of a regime change) were not resolved, and they wanted to thoroughly turn themselves over but dared not move. Last December, when the situation on the Pinghan Line became tense, the leadership called for war preparations, and the local bullies and landlords intimidated the masses and took back their land and livestock, and even took the amount of one year's yield under the pretext of renting the land again. The masses in Shiqiao Village even leased land to the landlord and secretly paid the landlord for the houses they were allocated. After the district leadership discovered these problems, they immediately decided: in conjunction with war preparations, deeply mobilize the masses, boldly support the masses and be their masters, starting with suppressing traitors and bullies. District cadres directly went to the villages to support the masses and be their masters, and the masses quickly took action. The villages of Shiqiao and Heilongdong held public trials of traitors Xian Zhang and Liang Qifu, and then the masses of Quanjou Village detained the traitor Shi Mengquan and confiscated all his guns and property extorted from the masses. Zhou Yi, the local tyrant who had seized village administration, was also overthrown. Changning also defeated the landlord lackeys who ruled the masses, and elected the activist Wang Qin as their leader. After suppressing the traitors and bullies, a thorough liquidation campaign quickly spread throughout the district. The traitorous landlord Zeng in Heilongdong once again used rumors to scare the masses, saying, "We'll talk about it later." The masses angrily replied, "Okay, whoever dies first wins, we are not easy to bully." After the masses' awareness was raised, they actively participated in the militia and automatically prepared for war. The masses in Shiqiao said, "Whether the reactionaries come or not, we must turn ourselves over. If they come, we will fight them."
