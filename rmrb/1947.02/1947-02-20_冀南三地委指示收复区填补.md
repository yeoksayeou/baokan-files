Jinan Third Prefectural Committee

Directs Filling in Gaps in Recovered Areas

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 18th dispatch] The Jinan Third Prefectural Committee issued instructions regarding the recovered areas north and south of the Zhanghe River in Daming, pointing out the following: 1. Because the enemy is retreating due to insufficient forces, we must prevent blind optimism and complacency in our thinking, and seize this war gap to intensify our work. 2. Continue to implement and complete post-war reconstruction work in the recovered areas, and conduct investigations and handle the difficulties in the lives of the masses caused by the enemy's looting, rape, and murder during their occupation. When the post-war reconstruction work comes to an end, quickly transition to a thorough review of emancipation and carry out land reform. 3. In the areas north of the Daming and Wei Rivers and in key counties, strive to complete the work of filling in gaps and making up deficiencies before the spring plowing season. Currently, focus mainly on distributing the fruits of victory. When distributing, follow the mass line to ensure fairness and reasonableness, and avoid rushing things due to time constraints. Organizational education work can be carried out in the course of production.

　　冀南三地委
    指示收复区填补
    【本报冀南十八日电】冀南三地委对大名漳河南北收复区发出指示，指出几点：一、敌人因兵力不足撤退，我们思想上须防止盲目乐观、松懈麻痹，应抓紧此战争空隙加紧工作。二、在收复区继续贯彻完成善后工作，对敌在时的抢掠奸杀所造成的群众生活困难，要进行调查处理。善后工作告一段落时，即迅速转入翻身大检查，进行土地改革。三、大、魏河北地区及中心县份，争取春耕前完成填平补齐，在目前主要抓紧分果实，分时要走群众路线，作到公平合理，不能因时间限制了草从事。组织教育工作，可在生产中贯彻之。
