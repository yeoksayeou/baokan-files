[Report from the Jiluyu Front by our correspondent on the 2nd] The "Huxi Anti-Japanese Martyrs Cemetery" in Shanxian County was tragically destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. After Shanxian was recovered, the democratic government immediately assisted the local people in rebuilding it. The cemetery was built by the people of Huxi (the area west of Dushan Lake in southwestern Shandong) over half a year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. It contains the remains of Li Zhengqian, Commissioner of the Huxi Anti-Japanese Special Zone, Xiao Ming, Commander of the 10th Regiment of the Jiluyu Eighth Route Army, and more than a hundred other martyrs, commanders, and fighters of the Eighth Route Army at all levels. Commissioner Li was the founder of the Huxi People's Volunteer Army and the Huxi Anti-Japanese Base Area. Commander Xiao was the commander who persisted in the four-year guerrilla war in Huxi. They were anti-Japanese leaders sincerely loved by hundreds of thousands of people in Huxi. After Fang Xianjue's troops of Chiang Kai-shek's army, who had surrendered to the enemy, invaded Shanxian at the end of August last year, they brutally destroyed the cemetery. They dug up all the graves of the hundred-odd martyrs, split open the coffins, and desecrated the corpses. They also bombarded the tops of the martyrs' tombs with artillery fire and used the cemetery as a target for aerial bombing and strafing exercises. The local people were extremely angry at this atrocity of Chiang Kai-shek's army. After the Eighth Route Army recovered the city on January 16, the democratic government immediately cooperated with the people to rebury the remains of the martyrs and actively started work to rebuild the cemetery.

　　蒋军无耻毁我烈士墓
    单县人民复修陵园
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】单县“湖西抗日烈士陵园”，惨遭蒋军破坏，单县收复后，民主政府立即协助当地群众兴工重修。该陵园由湖西（鲁西南独山湖以西地区）人民抗战胜利后以半载时间筑成，葬有湖西区抗日专员李正乾、冀鲁豫八路军第十团团长萧明、暨八路军各级指战员烈士百余人。李专员为湖西人民义勇军及湖西抗日根据地之创始人，萧团长为坚持湖西四年游击战争的指挥员，为湖西数十万人民衷心爱戴的抗日领袖。去年八月底投敌蒋军方先觉部侵占单县后，对该陵园惨加破坏，将百余烈士灵墓悉数挖开，劈棺裂尸，并发炮轰毁烈士墓顶，更将该陵园作为空军演习轰炸扫射之目标。当地群众对蒋军此种暴行，极端愤恨。一月十六日八路军收复该城后，民主政府立即协同群众将诸烈士忠骸重行安葬并积极兴工，重修陵园。
