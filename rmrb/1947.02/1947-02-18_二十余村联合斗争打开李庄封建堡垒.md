　　The masses in the eastern part of the sixth district of Yanggu County, Jilu Yu area, carried out their own propaganda and organization, developing the situation from joint struggles to village-level struggles. Lizhuang was a feudal fortress in the sixth district, with relatively concentrated land. The reactionary forces, colluding with enemy puppets, threatened and oppressed the villages in the east, causing resentment among the masses. Under the widespread demand of the masses, this joint struggle was launched. The farmers' association in Taihai Village had more than 40 members, each actively participating in the movement. They went to various villages in groups to directly propagate and organize the masses. Twenty-one villages, with more than 800 people, directly participated in this struggle, which lasted for four days with great momentum. The masses said, "Opening up Lizhuang is the beginning of the struggle." Following this, various villages launched struggles against traitors, bullies, and feudalism. The Lizhuang struggle gave the masses a great encouragement. The masses dared to speak, the upper-level feudal forces panicked, and the rumors also stopped. Even amidst the sound of gunfire, the masses continued to carry out struggles within the villages. They automatically prepared for war, declaring, "If the Central Army comes, we will fight them!" Everyone's confidence in the struggle has soared to unprecedented heights.
