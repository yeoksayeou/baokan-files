Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: Simultaneously with instigating puppet organizations and so-called celebrities to call for "peace," Chiang Kai-shek is stepping up the organization of another new offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area. One of the characteristics of this offensive will be the extensive use and coordination of the air force, as evidenced by Air Force Commander Zhou Zhirou's arrival in Xuzhou on the 29th. Recently, such bombing has already begun in Shandong, resulting in over a hundred peaceful residents killed and wounded, and many civilian houses destroyed. On the 24th of last month, three Chiang Kai-shek planes attacked Linyi, injuring six people. On the 30th, the day after Zhou Zhirou arrived in Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed important towns in western and southern Shandong, resulting in over ninety civilian deaths and injuries.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd: On the 28th of last month, ten Chiang Kai-shek planes attacked Linyi, the capital of the Shandong Liberated Area, again, dropping more than fifty bombs in the urban area and its suburbs, and strafing with machine guns for a long time. Because the military and civilians paid attention to air defense, only four people were killed or injured.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Two Chiang Kai-shek planes invaded the airspace over Malan Town, the location of the Guanzhong Sub-district Commissioner's Office in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, at 3:30 PM on the 1st, bombing and strafing for about twenty minutes, dropping a total of eighteen bombs, killing two residents (including a one-year-old girl), injuring two, and destroying a dozen houses. Furthermore, on the 29th of December, at noon, a Chiang Kai-shek plane strafed Quzishi in the Maling District of Quzi County in the Longdong Sub-district, causing some damage.

    蒋机肆虐鲁南各地
    陕甘宁关中区马栏镇亦被炸
    【新华社山东二日电】与策动御用社团和所谓名流呼吁“和平”同时，蒋介石正加紧组织对山东解放区的另一次新进攻。此次进攻的特点之一将为空军之广泛使用与配合，由空军司令周至柔二十九日之飞抵徐州可见端倪。近日此种轰炸业已在山东开始，计死伤和平居民百余人，被毁民房多处。上月二十四日，蒋机三架袭击临沂，伤亡群众六人。三十日，即周至柔抵达徐州之次日，蒋机遍炸山东西部南部各重要城镇，共死伤民众九十余人。
    【新华社山东三日电】上月二十八日，蒋机十架再袭山东解放区首府临沂，在城关及四郊共投炸弹五十余枚，机枪扫射甚久，因军民注意防空，仅伤亡四人。
    【新华社延安三日电】蒋机二架于一日下午三时三十分侵入陕甘宁边区关中分区专员公署所在地马栏市上空轰炸扫射约二十分点，计投弹十八枚，炸死居民二人（内有一周岁女孩），伤二人，毁房屋十数间。又十二月二十九日中午曾有蒋机一架扫射陇东分区曲子县之马岭区曲子市，略有损失。
