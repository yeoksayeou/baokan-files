　　Su Village Thoroughly Mobilizes Women in Mass Movement

[This Dispatch from Changzhi] In the land redistribution and filling-the-gaps movement, Su Village in Changzhi neglected the mobilization of women, resulting in an incomplete peasant emancipation. Cadres examined this problem and educated members to first mobilize their own wives. Then, they would mobilize other women. Within two days, more than fifty previously silent women rose up to pour out their grievances. The wife of Old Man Huangmao from South Street, in a trembling voice, accused the landlord Wang Ziqing of his crimes, saying: "Our family of four only has one quilt. The year before last, due to famine, we had nothing to eat or drink, so we had to pawn the quilt to the landlord Wang Ziqing for twenty yuan. Later, we couldn't get through the winter, so we had to rent it back daily for two yuan. In the end, we couldn't repay the debt, forcing us to mortgage the land as repayment." With the women taking action to conduct detailed investigations, more than a hundred hidden bundles belonging to the landlord Liu Taixin were uncovered. In this way, the entire village was mobilized, making the movement very thorough. (Liu Qiang, Han Qing)

　　苏店发动了妇女群运搞得很彻底
    【本报长治讯】长治苏店在填平补齐运动中，忽视了发动妇女，以致农民翻身不够彻底。干部检讨了这个问题，教育会员回去首先发动自己的老婆。再由她们发动其他妇女，两天内就有五十多个不吭气的妇女纷纷起来诉苦。南街黄毛老汉的老婆，用颤栗的声音，控诉地主王子清的罪行说：“我家四口人只盖一条被。前年因闹灾荒，没吃喝，只好将被子以二十元钱押给地主王子清，后来熬不过冬，又每天掏二元钱赁来。到头还不了债，逼得将地押了来顶。”妇女们行动起来细密检查，查出地主刘太心隐藏包袱一百多个，这样，全村群众都动了起来，把运动搞得很彻底。（刘强、汉清）
