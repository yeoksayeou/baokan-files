Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 21st – In Xiachuanping Village, Baode County, Jin Northwest, during the land reform, it was discovered that the feudal tyrant Gao Dengyun family had usurped village power, ruling the entire village with extremely brutal means. The democratic government was temporarily deceived, but was finally discovered recently, and was given the punishment it deserved. The Gao family had been local tyrants for three generations. After the establishment of the new government, Gao Dengyun ordered his uncles and brothers to infiltrate the village government, and he himself infiltrated the peasant association as a member. His brother, Gao Panyun, served as the militia company commander, and his lackey, Gao Hai, served as a squad leader. His uncle, Gao Huai, and his brother's wife served as the director and accountant of the cooperative, respectively. He even used money and beautiful women to lure cadres, ordering his daughter to seduce the district brigade leader Li Yuqing, and instigated him to retire from the army. He also ordered his niece (a family member of a soldier) to divorce and remarry the district cadre Han Zhenji. Han then seized Hao Mantang's 42 mu of farmland, 5 mu of jujube forest, and school buildings, and from then on, he did whatever he wanted, like the local emperor of Xiachuanping. Gao even called himself a "revolutionary family." Of the remaining 41 households with different surnames in the village, 39 were considered "spies" by him, and he did everything from arresting and tying up to torturing, and even murdered four people. At the same time, through Han Zhenji, he reported achievements to higher authorities, and the village was even considered a model village by the county. Gao's family used the organization of "labor exchange teams" to force the masses to cultivate their land, and the team members had to pay wages in reverse. He arbitrarily raped women through the collective textile factory, threw broken shoes to Ying Ti as a textile hero, and exploited the masses in the name of the military reception station, and deducted the food of the soldiers who stayed there. In September 1943, when the Japanese invaders "swept" through the area, he killed two militiamen who had escaped from the enemy, and falsely reported to the government that Gao Hai had "bravely" killed the puppet soldiers, thus protecting Gao Hai as a militia hero. Although the masses repeatedly complained about this heinous behavior, it was all to no avail due to Gao Dengyun's sabotage and Han Zhenji's cover-up, and the peasant Hao Laotong, who participated in the complaint, was pushed off a cliff and killed by Gao Dengyun. Hao Jinbei, a family member of a soldier, was raped, and his daughter was even falsely accused by him and detained for 18 months. From then on, Gao Dengyun's murderous intentions grew stronger, and the blacklist increased to 12 people. The newly appointed district head, Zhang Lianguo, accepted the masses' complaints, but also failed due to Han Zhenji's deception. Half a month later, at a villagers' meeting, Liu Yulin, who spoke boldly at the meeting, was beaten to death by the Gao family, and the whole village was plunged into terror. Recently, the county sent Zhang Zhengxue to the village to carry out land reform. Seeing that the masses did not dare to speak and did not dare to ask for land, he carefully investigated from house to house, gradually discovered the problem, and first returned the land and houses illegally occupied by Han Zhenji to their original owners. Seeing that the democratic government was indeed supporting the people, men, women, old and young immediately boldly complained, tearfully exposing Gao Dengyun's crimes, which continued for six days and six nights, and unanimously demanded that the murderers be severely punished. The democratic government then arrested Gao Dengyun, Gao Hai, and others, dismissed district cadre Han Zhenji from his post for investigation, and returned all 220 mu of land, 25 houses, 50 sheep, and a large amount of food seized by Gao to their original owners, and used this to mobilize the masses to carry out land reform and transform the village government and various mass organizations. Now, the poor peasants in the village have an average of four mu of land per person, and 43 peasants have voluntarily requested to join the peasant association, and 50 young people have joined the militia. The village of Xiachuanping has swept away the gloomy atmosphere of the past and is full of active and new vitality.

　　高登云篡夺村政终被揭露
    下川坪严惩恶霸
    群众获得翻身各种组织大发展
    【新华社晋绥二十一日电】晋西北保德县下川坪村，在土地改革中发现封建恶霸高登云家族篡夺村政权，统治全村，手段极残暴。民主政权曾受其一时蒙蔽，但终于最近发觉，给予应得的惩处。高家已三代恶霸，新政权建立后，高登云令其叔伯兄弟混入村政权，其本人混入农会任委员，兄弟高攀云任民兵中队长，他的走狗高孩当分队长，其伯父高怀与其第媳分任合作社主任与会计。他更以金钱美女拉拢干部，令他女儿勾引区大队长李玉青，唆其退伍，又令其外甥女（抗属）离婚改嫁与区干部韩振基。并为韩霸占了郝满堂四十二亩耕地、五亩枣林地，及小学校舍，从此为所欲为，俨然下川坪土皇地。高竟自称为“革命家庭”，该村中其余四十一户外姓，有三十九人被他认为“特务”，抓绑拷打，无所不为，并曾杀害四条人命。同时通过韩振基向上级报成绩，该村竟被县上认为模范村。高家借组织“变工队”强迫群众为其耕地，队员还要倒贴地工资。他经过集体纺织厂任意奸淫妇女，把破鞋扔进英提为纺织英雄，又借拥军招待所名义剥削群众，克扣过住军人伙食。四三年九月，日寇“扫荡”时，他将从敌人手中逃出的两个民兵杀死，反向政府伪报说是高孩“勇敢”打死的伪军，因而保着高孩为民兵英雄。这种罪大恶极的行为，虽经群众多次控诉，但均因高登云破坏及韩振基从中包庇，而毫无效果，且参加控告的农民郝老同竟被高登云推崖摔死。抗属郝锦贝被奸污，其女竟被他反咬一口，拘押了十八个月。从此高登云杀机益炽，黑名单上增至十二人。新任区长张连国，接受群众控诉，亦因韩振基一手蒙蔽而失败。半月后村民开会时，会上大胆发言的刘玉林，又被高家打死，全村陷入恐怖。最近县上派张正学到该村进行土地改革，见群众不敢发言，不敢要地，遂细心地挨户调查，逐渐发现了问题，乃先将韩振基非法霸占之土地房屋退还原主。群众见民主政府确为人民撑腰，男女老幼遂即大胆控诉，含泪揭发高登云的罪恶，一直继续了六天六夜，一致要求严办凶犯。民主政府遂将高登云，高孩等逮捕，将区干部韩振基撤职查办，并将高强占之土地二百二十亩、房二十五间、羊五十只及大批食粮悉数退还原主，并以此发动群众，进行土地改革，改造村政权及各种群众组织。现该村贫农每人平均得地四亩，已有四十三个农民自动要求参加了农会，五十个青年参加民兵，下川坪村一扫过去阴沉的空气，充满了活跃新生的气象。
