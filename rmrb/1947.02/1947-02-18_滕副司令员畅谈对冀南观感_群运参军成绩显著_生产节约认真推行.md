　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] "Everything shows vigorous vitality, and everything presents an unprecedented new atmosphere." This is the general description of Southern Hebei by General Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, who has just returned from there. General Teng went to Southern Hebei on official business before the New Year and witnessed the land reform and mass emancipation movement in the counties during his tour of the area, which achieved great success last year. Each farmer has been allocated an average of three mu of land, and land reform in all counties can be completed before this year's spring plowing. He said: "The achievement of these results is inseparable from the joint efforts of the Party, government, army, and people in the area, and the in-depth work of cadres at all levels at the grassroots level." When General Teng arrived at the Southern Hebei Military Region, it was shortly after New Year's Day, but the local Party, government, army, and civilian organs were all empty. They did not take a holiday, and cadres from various systems were still working hard at the grassroots level to promote mass emancipation. Even Comrade Wang Congwu, the Secretary of the Regional Party Committee, was working at the grassroots level like every other cadre and had not returned. While staying in the village where the administrative office was located, General Teng visited many residents. He said: "I asked a family of four farmers, and they bought a total of four jin of pork and four jin of mutton for the New Year. Another family of five bought fifteen jin of meat. These emancipated farmers, men and women, old and young, all wore brand-new clothes, and everywhere was red and green. Their joy and happiness were also unprecedented." Precisely because they were emancipated and obtained land, the masses' enthusiasm for joining the army to protect their homes was also unprecedentedly high. Last autumn, 7,000 young people from Southern Hebei went to the front lines, and in winter, another 29,000 people joined the army, accounting for one-third of the total number of recruits in the region. None of these new soldiers failed to meet the standards after being sent to the troops, and none deserted. Regarding this significant achievement, Deputy Commander Teng specifically praised it at the Southern Hebei cadre meeting on behalf of the Central Bureau. In Handan City and other parts of Southern Hebei, General Teng also saw delegations sent by all sectors of society enthusiastically visiting the front lines, bringing with them a large number of congratulatory letters, various gifts, and comfort bags. In particular, the comfort bags greatly encouraged the soldiers at the front. The comfort bags were filled with all kinds of gifts and contained enthusiastic words such as "Wishing comrades good health" and "Wishing victory on the front lines." When the soldiers carried them, they thought of the millions of people in the rear who were concerned about them and supporting them, which further strengthened their determination to defend their fruits and the liberated areas. In the directly affiliated units of the Southern Hebei Military Region and the Fifth Military Sub-district, General Teng saw all the cadres of the organs summing up their work for the year, electing various models, and commending various heroes. He said: "This is the best way to strengthen the work of the rear organs, improve the combat effectiveness of the troops, and launch a movement to perform meritorious service for the people. It is best if this method can be used in all Party, government, army, and civilian organs to launch a unified meritorious service movement." He also said: "Southern Hebei is also paying close attention to production and thrift, and all organs are conscientiously implementing the Central Bureau's call for production and thrift. Around New Year's Day, the Southern Hebei Regional Party Committee, Administrative Office, and Military Region jointly issued specific measures for the entire region to promote production and thrift to support the front lines. After the small stoves in the Military Region were abolished, the various sub-districts followed suit. In particular, the field troops of the Southern Hebei Military Region, after participating in the supply meeting of the major military region, resolutely implemented the decision of the Central Bureau and handed over all the assets of their own cooperatives and factories to the Finance Office for acceptance, and they handed them over the fastest and earliest. This point is worth learning from other departments." On the basis of the mass emancipation movement in the entire region, the leaders in Southern Hebei have paid attention to preparing for this year's large-scale production movement. On the 31st of last month, they held a joint meeting of the Prefectural Secretaries, Commissioners, County Secretaries, and County Heads to discuss this year's large-scale production issues. During the meeting, Deputy Commander Teng reported the current situation and tasks to them on behalf of the Central Bureau and praised Southern Hebei for making remarkable achievements in land reform, joining the army and participating in the war, and overcoming financial and economic difficulties. He especially hoped that they would: strengthen current affairs education, eliminate obstacles to mass production, establish the masses' thinking of becoming wealthy, strengthen the organization of labor mutual aid, learn from the production experience of Daxing, increase the production of cotton planting in the plains, and organize the export of large quantities of finished cotton products (rather than raw material exports) to welcome the upcoming large-scale production movement.

　　滕副司令员畅谈对冀南观感
    群运参军成绩显著
    生产节约认真推行
    【本报特讯】“一切都表现着生气勃勃，一切都呈现出从所未有的新气象。”这是刚从冀南归来的军区副司令员滕代远将军对冀南观感的总的描述。滕将军于新年前因公赴冀南，在该区环行途中，目睹各县土地改革，群众翻身运动，在去年作得很有成绩。每个农民平均都已分得三亩土地，今年春耕以前，各县土地改革全部可以完成。他说：“这些成绩的获得，是与该区党政军民共同努力，各级干部深入下层是分不开的。”滕将军到达冀南军区时，正是元旦后不久，但当地党政军民的机关，都是空空的，他们没有放假，各个系统的干部，仍然在下边突击群众翻身工作。连区党委书记王从吾同志也和每个干部一样，深入在下层没有回来。在行署驻村，滕将军访问了许多居民。他说：“我问了一家四口的农民，他们在过新年中共买了四斤猪肉和四斤羊肉。另一家五口人，就买了十五斤肉。这些翻了身的农民男女，老头子小孩们，都穿着崭新的衣服，到处是红红绿绿，他们的高兴欢喜，那也是过去所没有见过的。”正因为他们翻了身，获得了土地，群众参军保家乡的情绪也表现出空前的热烈。去秋冀南有七千青年走上前线，冬季又有二万九千人从军，他们共占全区参军人数的三分之一。这些新战士送到部队后，没有一个不合乎标准，也没有一个人逃亡。对于这一重大成绩，滕副司令员特别代表中央局，在冀南干部会上予以表扬。在邯郸市，在冀南各地，滕副司令员更看到各界所派的代表团，热情的去慰问前线，他们摧带着大批的慰问信各种礼物和慰问袋。特别是慰问袋，给予前方战士的鼓舞很大。慰问袋里装着各种各样的礼物，并写着“祝同志们健康”“祝前线胜利”的热情的话语，战士们携带着它时，就想起后方千百万人民在挂念他，在支援他，更加增强了他保卫果实，保卫解放区的决心。在冀南军区直属队，在第五军分区，滕副司令员看见机关全体干部正在总结一年工作，选举各种模范，表扬各种英雄。他说：“这是加强后方机关工作，提高部队战斗力，开展为人民立功运动最好的方式。最好这种方式能用到党政军民一切机关中去，开展一个一元化的立功运动。”他又说：“冀南对于生产节约也抓得很紧，各机关对中央局生产节约的号召都在认真的执行。元旦前后，冀南区党委、行署、军区即联合发布了全区生产节约支援前线的具体办法。军区小灶取消后，分区各级也随着取消了。特别是冀南军区野战部队，他们在参加大军区供给会议后，即坚决执行中央局的决定，把自己本部的合作社工厂资财全部交给了财办接收，并且交代得最快最早，这点是值得其他各部学习的。”在全区群众翻身的基础上，冀南领导上已注意准备今年的大生产运动，上月三十一日他们召开了地书、专员、县书、县长联席会议，讨论今年的大生产问题。席间滕副司令员代表中央局向他们报告了目前的形势和任务，并当场表扬了冀南在土地改革、参军参战及克服财政经济困难等方面都作出了显著成绩，今后特别希望他们：抓紧时事教育，肃清群众生产障碍，树立群众发家思想，并加强组织劳动互助，学习大行生产经验，提高平原棉植生产，组织大批棉织成品出口（而不是原料出口），以迎接即将到来的大生产运动。
