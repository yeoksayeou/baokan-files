Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. According to the Tianjin Yishibao on the 19th, the Western Kang civil unrest armed forces that revolted to resist tyranny have reached 500,000 people. According to news from the Tianjin Dagongbao and Shanghai United Evening News: A part of the Western Kang rebels attacked Tianquan County on New Year's Eve, staying for five hours. Apart from searching the Kang Provincial Bank Tianquan Branch and Tianquan County Bank, the residents did not suffer major losses, only summoning the Baojia chiefs to provide one dan of rice per Bao. After collecting it, they left calmly. Other units simultaneously besieged Rongjing, Lushan, Baotong, and Ya'an, where the Chiang government's administrative commissioner's office was located. The counties east of Kangding in the province, under the jurisdiction of Ya'an, are inhabited by both Yi and Han people, while the counties southeast of Xichang and Ningyuan are Yi areas. The Chiang government has always adopted a policy of massacre against the Yi people. In April of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), a "Headquarters for Suppressing the Yi" was established, extorting silver and opium from the Yi people unsuccessfully, and then implementing armed suppression. Two regiments were captured alive by the Yi people, resulting in a major defeat. In the spring of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), Sichuan and Kang provinces simultaneously "suppressed" again. The Sichuan side fought fiercely in Leibo, Mabian, Pingba, and Ebian, which ended in May. On the Western Kang side, fierce battles took place in Tianquan and Rongjing counties. The Chiang army lost one regiment and four companies, and then transferred a division of troops to "suppress." The insurgent army, due to the disparity in the quality of weapons, retreated to Puxiong, the central area of the Yi ethnic group. According to a report by the "Western Kang Group in Chongqing Petitioning for the Protection of Their Hometowns" in Chongqing on May 3rd last year, more than 200,000 people were killed or injured in this war. Until the beginning of December last year, a certain regiment of the Chiang army extorted "public opium" in Rongjing, Tianquan and other counties, and posted notices saying: Anyone who colludes with the rebel leader Li Yuanheng in "rebellion" will have their entire family destroyed. At that time, thousands of disaster victims in Tianquan returned home in teams, and the regiment intercepted them on December 3rd, arousing the anger of the people in various counties, and the large-scale civil unrest in Tianquan and Rongjing counties broke out as a result. At the same time, nearly 100,000 Yi armed forces in Puxiong also resisted due to the Chiang government's "suppression." The Chiang government continues to adhere to a bloody massacre policy against the Yi people in Western Kang. He Guoguang, the Xichang garrison commander, recently arrived in Chongqing from Beijing, and on the 18th, he told the Dagongbao reporter that the "Yi criminal problem" would still be handled with a combination of "political and military means." On the 28th, he flew back to Xichang from Chongqing to make arrangements.

　　反抗蒋政府血腥屠杀政策
    西康五十万夷民大起义
    一度袭入天全围攻雅安荣经
    【新华社延安一日电】据天津益世报十九日载：为反抗暴政而起义的西康民变武装已达五十万人。另据津大公报、沪联合晚报消息：西康变民一部于阳历除夕之夜攻入天全县城，逗留五小时。除搜索官方之康省银行天全分行及天全县银行外，居民无大损失，仅召集保甲长每保派米一担，收齐后从容离去。其他各部同时围攻荣经、卢山、宝同及蒋政府行政专署所在地之雅安。按该省康定以东雅安所属各县，夷汉杂处，东南西昌、宁远所属各县为夷民区，蒋政府对夷民向采屠杀政策。民国三十四年四月，即成立“剿夷总部”，勒索夷民之白银鸦片未遂，实行武装进剿，被夷民生俘其两团，大败而归。三十五年春，川康两省同时再度“进剿”，四川方面激战于雷波、马边、屏巴、峨边，至五月始告结束；西康方面激战于天全、荣经两县，蒋军损失一个团又四个中队，又增调一个师兵力前往“进剿”，起义军给以武器优劣悬殊，退至夷族中心区之普雄。此次战争，据“西康留渝团体护乡联合请愿团”去年五月三日在渝报告，人民死伤二十余万。至去年十二月初，蒋军某团又在荣经、天全等县勒索“公烟”，且张贴布告谓：敢有与变民领袖李元亨伙同“叛乱”者，毁其满门。时有天全灾民数千结队返家，该团竟于十二月三日加以阻击，激起各县人民愤怒，此次天荣各县大规模之民变由是爆发。与此同时，普雄方面近十万夷民武装亦因蒋政府之“进剿”而进行反抗。蒋政府对西康夷族仍坚持血腥屠杀政策。其西昌警备司令贺国光近由京抵渝，十八日曾对大公报记者发表“夷犯问题”仍“政治军事并用”之谈话，二十八日已由渝飞返西昌进行布置。
