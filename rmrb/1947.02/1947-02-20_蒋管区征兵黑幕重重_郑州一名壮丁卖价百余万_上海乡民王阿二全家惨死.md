Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Bao reported on the heavy corruption in conscription in Chiang-controlled areas, stating: Sun, the township head of a certain township near Shanghai, recently tried to capture draftee Wang Er'a without success. He押送 (deporting, escorting) Wang's wife to the county government, leaving two young children at home. A fire broke out in the house, and because it was in a remote location, no one came to help, causing both children to be burned to death. Wang's wife returned home distraught, and committed suicide by hanging herself from a tree in the middle of the night. Er'a returned to witness the tragic scene, then grabbed a kitchen knife and ran to the home of township head Sun, killing all six members of his family, before taking his own life by slitting his throat. In Huanyu Township, Yushan County, Jiangxi, armed conscription was recently implemented, and draftee Chen Funi of the fifth bao of the township was actually executed. Moreover, in the provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, draftees are often forced to pay money to hire substitutes. In Hubei Province, due to the "inconsistent market" for buying draftees, each person's burden varies. In Wuhu, draftees bought for 10,000 to 30,000 yuan each are tied up with hemp ropes, resembling criminals. In Zhengzhou, the price of draftees has risen along with commodity prices, from 1.2 million yuan per person in December to 1.8 million yuan in January. According to those familiar with the inside story: a Zhengzhou baojia head can earn the price of one draftee by handling the purchase of ten draftees.

　　蒋管区征兵黑幕重重
    郑州一名壮丁卖价百余万
    上海乡民王阿二全家惨死
    【新华社延安十七日电】沪大公、文汇报报导，蒋区各地征兵黑幕称：上海附近某乡孙乡长近捕捉壮丁王阿二未获，将王妻押送县府，留两幼孩在家，适房屋起火，又以地处荒僻，无人施救，致两孩被烧死。王妻回家大恸，半夜在树上自尽而死，阿二归睹惨状，遂寻菜刀一把，奔孙乡长家，将其全家六个杀死，然后自刎丧命。江西玉山县属环玉乡，近实行武装抓丁，该乡第五保壮丁陈富昵竟被枪毙。又鄂豫皖各省多勒令壮丁出钱买人顶替。鄂省因买丁“行情不一致”，每人担负不等。芜湖每人出一万至三万元买来的壮丁，用麻绳捆结，形同罪犯。郑州壮丁价格随物价上涨，十二月间每名一百二十万，一月间已一跃而为一百八十万，据熟悉内幕者称：郑州保甲长经手购买十名壮丁，可赚一名壮丁价款。
