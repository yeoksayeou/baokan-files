    Thirteen Factories Along the Zhang River Hold a Meeting
    Launch an Industrial Production Increase Movement
    [Report from our Taihang correspondent] The Taihang General Labor Union convened a joint meeting of managers, factory directors, and union chairmen from thirteen factories along the Zhang River on the 27th of last month. Present at the meeting were Director Li Yiqing of the Taihang Administrative Office, and over twenty people from units such as the Military Region Clothing Factory, Taiwu Repair Shop, Postal Administration, Xinhua Printing Factory, and Paper Mill. The main topic of discussion was how to launch this year's industrial production increase movement and promote this movement throughout the entire region. In addition to workers vigorously increasing production, it was demanded that all managers and administrative personnel, based on production and the needs of the masses, as well as their own work positions, formulate specific personal plans. For mines and factories lacking labor, the labor problem should be resolved first, based on the principle of benefiting both workers and peasants. Seasonal production should prepare for a change in production methods as early as possible. Regarding the relationship between factories and employees, the issue of mutual benefit for labor and capital, as well as democratic centralism, should be resolved based on the specific circumstances of each factory. The steps of the movement are as follows: the first stage is from February 7th to May 1st, with a preliminary summary and continued in-depth promotion, and a comprehensive summary and selection of model factories will be conducted by August 1st. Strengthen the ideological education of all employees in supporting the patriotic self-defense war. The leadership should concentrate its efforts on breaking through one department, gaining experience, and promoting the entire factory. Finally, nine people were selected to form an industrial competition committee to lead this movement. Director Li Yiqing pointed out: On the industrial front, we must truly implement Chairman Mao's call to achieve "more quantity, better quality, lower cost, sufficient raw materials, and broad sales channels" to overcome our region's financial difficulties and welcome the victory of the self-defense counter-offensive.

    【本报太行一日电】太行总工会于上月二十七日，召开漳河沿岸十三个工厂经理、厂长及工会主任联席会议，到会有太行行署李一清主任及军区被服厂、太武修械所、邮政管理局、新华印刷厂、纸厂等单位二十余人，会上主要讨论如何发起本年度工业增产运动，并将此一运动推广全区。除工人厉行增产外，要求不论经理杂务人员，都要根据生产和群众需要，及自己工作岗位，订出个人具体计划，对缺乏劳力的矿山、工厂，应在工农两利原则下，首先解决劳力问题。带有季节性的生产，应及早准备转换生产方式。在厂方与职工关系上，应根据各该工厂具体情况，解决劳资两利及民主集中问题，运动的步骤。由“二七”至“五一”为第一阶段，初步总结，继续推进深入，到“八一”进行全面总结与选模范工厂。加强全体职工支援爱国自卫战争的思想教育。领导上集中力量突破一个部门，取得经验，推动全厂。最后选出九人，组成工业竞赛委员会，以领导这一运动，李一清主任指出：在工业战线上，我们要真正实行毛主席的号召，作到“数量多质量好，成本低，原料足，销路广，”以克服我区财经困难，迎接自卫反攻胜利。
