　　[Report from the Jilu Yu Front, February 25th] The 29th Regiment of the New Wang Brigade of Chiang's 58th Division, along with the Yongcheng Security Regiment, totaling 2,000 men, launched an attack on a certain local troop in the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu area on the 18th from Anyang and Longxingji (both west of Yongcheng). They were met with a forceful counterattack by our troops in the Dadinglou and Dingbaishuyuan (northwest of Yongcheng) area, suffering over 60 casualties. On the same day, over 600 enemies from Xiayi County invaded Xuanlou, the location of our Xiayi County Democratic Government. Upon hearing this, a certain detachment of our army swiftly rushed to reinforce, routing the enemy. Pursuing them for fifteen li, the enemy fled back to Xiayi City in a panic. We inflicted over 60 casualties and captured many other spoils of war. On the 19th, our army annihilated a part of the puppet army led by Zhang Shengtai in Zhumiaodian (south of Caoxian County), capturing 60 enemy rifles and many other spoils of war.
