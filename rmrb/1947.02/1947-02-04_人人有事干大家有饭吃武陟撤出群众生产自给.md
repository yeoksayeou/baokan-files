    [This newspaper’s Taihang dispatch, dated 30th] After the Chiang Kai-shek troops launched a major offensive against our northern Henan region in October of last year, the local masses were forced to abandon their homes and flee to the mountains. Through the democratic government's organization of production for self-salvation, the majority of the evacuees have now settled down. The sixteen households (twenty-eight people) evacuated from Dahongqiao in Wuzhi settled in Cuicun, Lingchuan. The government immediately provided a loan of 100,000 yuan, which, together with the fruits of their liberation, amounted to more than 200,000 yuan. To facilitate the organization of production, they voluntarily combined and divided themselves into four groups for meals. Rice, flour, and vegetables were purchased and distributed by designated personnel. In terms of the division of labor in production, assignments were made according to each person's unique skills and abilities. In terms of handicraft production, there was a carpentry group specializing in making spinning wheels, a hemp spinning group, and a women's weaving group; in terms of commercial production, there were slaughterhouses, grocery stalls, and food shops, achieving the goal of everyone having something to do and everyone having food to eat. The reason for everyone's enthusiastic unity in production is: first, the implementation of profit-sharing based on shares and skills, and consideration was given to each family's specific difficulties. Second, the encouragement, praise, and rewards from the leadership aroused everyone's enthusiasm for production. There were no lazy people in the groups. Third, the exemplary role of leaders such as Zhai Guanglie. They originally had higher skills than others, but they were no more special than others in profit-sharing and production. For example, when going to market, they never ate an extra pancake, even after being cold and hungry all day, which everyone greatly admired. Before the New Year, they settled their production accounts and found that in just two months of production, after deducting the cost of cotton clothing and food, they had made a net profit of 180,000 yuan.

　　人人有事干大家有饭吃武陟撤出群众生产自给
    【本报太行卅日电】蒋军于去年十月大举向我豫北进攻后，当地群众被迫弃井离乡撤往山地，经民主政府组织生产自救，大部撤出群众现已安家。武陟大虹桥撤出的十六户（廿八口人），在陵川崔村安家后，政府当即贷给十万元，连同他们的翻身果实，共凑到廿余万元。为便于组织生产，他们在自愿结合下，分为四组吃饭，米面蔬菜，推选专人负责置买与分发。在生产分工上，根据各人特有技术及能力大小分工分组。在手工业生产方面，有木匠组，专制纺花车，纺麻组，妇女纺织组；在商业生产方面有杀坊，杂货摊，饭铺等组做到了人人有事干，大家有饭吃。大家团结生产热烈原因是：一、实行了按股按技术分红，并依据各家具体困难，又做了照顾。二、在领导上以鼓励表扬和奖励激起了大家生产积极性。组内没有偷懒人。三、领导人翟广烈等模范作用。他们本来技术比别人高，但他们在分红与生产上，都不比别人特殊。比如在赶集时，他们受冷受冻一天，总没有另外吃过一个烧饼，大家很感佩。年前进行生产结账，仅两月生产，除大家穿棉衣吃用外，已获得净利十八万元。
