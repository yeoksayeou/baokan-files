    Our Army's Released Prisoners Mostly Detained by Chiang's Army
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline, February 9th] Most of the prisoners released by the Eighth Route Army have been detained by Chiang's army in Chengwu, southwestern Shandong. More than 40 Chiang army soldiers released by the Eighth Route Army were all detained by the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division upon returning to Shan County and were imprisoned. It was not until the Eighth Route Army recovered Shan County on the 26th of last month that they were liberated again. Furthermore, according to a letter from Wang Chenghua, a former subordinate of Dai Pu, the brigade commander of the 62nd Brigade of the 88th Division, to the 32nd Regiment of the 11th Division in Suqian on New Year's Day, "The Eighth Route Army released prisoners of our brigade, showed them minor kindness, and gave them comfort and 'stimulation,' etc., to agitate their lack of ambition. After returning to the team, they shake our military's heart and disintegrate our morale. Therefore, we now plan to detain and break up the released soldiers so that they do not talk to our soldiers." It should be noted that the prisoners released by the Eighth Route Army are all unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. The Eighth Route Army provides them with assistance and allows them to return home to resume their old occupations. Unexpectedly, they were captured by Chiang's army to be soldiers again and suffered such cruel treatment from Chiang's army.

    我军释放俘虏多被蒋军扣押
    【本报冀鲁豫前线九日电】八路军前所释放之俘虏，大部为蒋军押扣在鲁西南城武。被八路军释放之蒋军士兵四十余人，回到单县后，全部被八十八师二十一旅押扣，关在监牢里。直到上月二十六日，八路军收复单县时，才重获解放。又据八十八师六十二旅旅长戴璞之旧部王诚华元旦于宿迁十一师三二团致渠信中称：“八路军释放我旅俘虏，施以小患，并予安慰与刺激等语，煽惑其无志，归队后动摇我军心，涣散我士气，故今拟扣押破释放之兵，使其不与我士兵接谈。”按八路军释放之俘虏，均系不愿充作蒋介石内战炮灰者，八路军予以资助，放其回家，使其恢复旧业。不料又被蒋军抓去当兵，遭到蒋军这样残酷的待遇。
