　　Taiyue Organs
    Select Production and Thrift Models
    [This newspaper, Taiyue] The Taiyue District Party Committee organs, on the evening of January 14th, voted to elect comrades Zhang Bingxun, Jiang An'nan, and Bai Jixi as model workers. Since Comrade Zhang Bingxun took office as administrator, he has consistently been conscientious and responsible in his work, burying himself in hard work. He cherishes public property as if it were his own. Whenever he sees that the saddles and other equipment for the livestock are broken, he urges the feeders or personally works with them to mend them, in order to save public expenses.
    [Another dispatch] Comrade Zheng Zuozhou, a model of production and thrift, led the masses in repairing bridges, saving more than 200,000 yuan in unfixed costs because he allowed the masses to plan. Comrade Wang Duizheng earned 8,600 yuan by carrying coal, farming, and knitting sweaters in his spare time, and also taught six people how to knit sweaters. Comrade Cui Youde reduced the 102 types of forms stipulated by the Border Region Government to 85 types, making them simpler and clearer. Comrade Jin Dezhu, in three months, saved more than 100 jin of grain coupons in odd amounts, and without concealing anything, handed them over completely to the public.

　　太岳各机关
    选出生产节约模范
    【本报太岳讯】太岳区党委机关，于元月十四日晚，投票选出：张炳勋、蒋安南、白吉喜等三同志为模范工作者。张炳勋同志自任管理员以来，对工作一贯认真负责，埋头苦干，对公物的爱护如同自己的一样，我们一见牲口的马鞍等用具破了，就督促饲养员或亲自动手与饲养员一块补缝，以便节省公家开支。
    【又讯】行着生产节约模范郑作舟同志领导群众修桥，由于让群众打算，节省二十多万元未料费；王堆正同志在工作空隙中担炭、种地、打毛衣，赚洋八千六百元，还教会六个人打毛衣；崔有的同志把边区政府规定的一百零二种表格，缩减成八十五种，简单明白；靳德柱同志，在三个月里零星节余一百多斤粮票，毫不隐瞒，完全交了公家。
