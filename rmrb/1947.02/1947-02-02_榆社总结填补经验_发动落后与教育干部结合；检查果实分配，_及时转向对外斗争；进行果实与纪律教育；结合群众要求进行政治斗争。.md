　　Yushe Summarizes Experience in Filling Gaps

    【Our Newspaper News】Under the principle of filling gaps and making up deficiencies, Yushe has launched a large-scale emancipation movement in the past month. Farmers have further obtained land, houses, food, clothing, and have vented years of pent-up anger. The farmers' enthusiasm is extremely high. The recent meeting of key cadres from various districts summarized the following experiences: (1) In the movement, attention was paid to mobilizing honest and backward farmers, which is a sign of the movement's deepening. This was done more thoroughly in villages such as Tancun Chengguan, Hancun, and Haobi. Experience has shown that it is necessary to enlighten them, dispel their ideological concerns, and improve their understanding. The method of using bitterness to lead to bitterness should be used to guide them to speak out their grievances; however, in the struggle, advanced elements must be prohibited from monopolizing and substituting for them. At the same time, this work must be combined with the education of cadres, changing the cadres' view of looking down on them, changing the cadres' simplistic style, and conducting appropriate "face washing" to unite the farmers. (2) In some places, under the principle of internal rectification and unity against external enemies, emancipation inspections were carried out. Using ideological education methods and cadres' self-criticism, the problems of stance and style were cleared up, a portion of the excessive gains was given up, and procedures were cleared, so that the relationship between cadres and the masses was close and united against external enemies. Experience has shown that if there are problems with the distribution of fruits, it is not possible not to inspect; if the inspection is not clear, it will affect the farmers' emotions; if the inspection stays for too long, it will also affect the farmers' enthusiasm. The problem of inspecting fruits should be initially resolved, and then continue to resolve it in the external struggle. (3) Promotion and application of fruit education and discipline education. Cadres and activists were educated to be clean about the fruits, and regulations were also made: no selfishness, no embezzlement, no grabbing, and no material rewards. An exhibition of different kinds of "fruits" was also held, which was of great educational significance to the farmers and a good way to check the fruits of struggle. (4) In cutting the "tails" (referring to remnants of the old order), an "air-venting" struggle was launched, and some experience was gained. Farmers were very satisfied with the targets that were combined with the farmers' demands in the land reform; however, the farmers did not sympathize much with the targets that were purely political struggles without combining with the masses' demands. In the early stage of the movement, from top to bottom, from inside to outside, taking the opportunity to quickly engage in "elimination of harm," although harm was eliminated, the middle and backward strata of farmers were not very satisfied, did not sympathize much, and some were even afraid. Later, the leadership proposed opposing acute illness, opposing substitution and monopolization, proposing that bitterness should be fully expressed and anger should be fully vented, struggling while complaining, and combining economic struggle with political struggle. In this way, the demands of activists and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers were combined.

　　榆社总结填补经验
    发动落后与教育干部结合；检查果实分配，及时转向对外斗争；进行果实与纪律教育；结合群众要求进行政治斗争。
    【本报讯】榆社在填平补齐方针下，近一月来开展了大规模的翻身运动，农民进一步取得了土地、房屋、粮食、衣物，并出了多年来未出透的气，农民热情极高。日前召开的各区主要干部会议。总结出以下经验：（一）运动中注意了发动老实农民、落后农民，这是运动深入的标志。在潭村城关韩村郝壁等村做得较为深入。经验证明，必须启发他们，解除思想顾虑，提高他们的认识，用以苦引苦的方法，引导他们诉苦；但在斗争中须禁止先进分子包办代替。同时这一工作必须与教育干部相结合，转变干部看不起他们的观点，转变干部简单作风，并进行适当的洗脸，团结农民。（二）若干地方在整顿内部一致对外的原则下，进行了翻身检查，用思想教育的方法，干部自我检讨的方式，清算了立场与作风的毛病，让出一部多得的果实，清理手续，使干部与群众关系密切起来，一致对外。经验证明，果实分配有问题，不检查不行，如检查不清，会影响农民情绪，检查如果停留时间过长，也会影响农民热情。应先初步的解决一下检查果实问题，然后在对外斗争中，继续解决。（三）推广与运用了果实教育与纪律教育。教育干部、积极分子对果实清白，同时也作了规定：不自私，不挪借，不抢拿，不作物质奖励。又进行了异实的展览，这对农民的教育意义很大，又是检查斗争果实的好办法。（四）在割尾巴中，开展了出气斗争，取得了一些经验。凡在土地改革中，结合农民要求搞的对象，农民非常满意；但是不结合群众要求，单纯的政治斗争简单方式搞了对象，农民不大同情。在运动前期的由上而下，由内而外，趁机急搞，除害观点，虽然除了害，但农民中间层、落后层不大满意，不大同情，个别的还恐惧。后来领导上提出反对急性病，反对代替包办，提出苦要诉尽，气要出透，一边诉一边斗，苦诉完，气出尽，把经济斗争和政治斗争结合起来。这样，积极分子要求和广大农民的热情结合起来了。
