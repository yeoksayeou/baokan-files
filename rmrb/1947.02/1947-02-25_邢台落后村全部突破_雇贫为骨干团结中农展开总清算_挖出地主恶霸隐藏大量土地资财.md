　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Xingtai] (According to our newspaper in Xingtai) After a large-scale review of emancipation in Xingtai County last December, through two months of in-depth movement, the feudal fortresses in more than fifty backward villages have been broken through, bringing the county's movement towards balance and comprehensively entering the stage of leveling up and filling gaps. The characteristics of the in-depth movement in this county are: first, large-scale struggle against landlords and local bullies with poor peasants and farm laborers as the backbone uniting middle peasants; second, from in-depth ideological mobilization to centralized liquidation struggle. Before the in-depth movement, many backward villages had landlords sending their henchmen to serve as cadres in various systems, maintaining feudal rule unchanged. Some villages had also superficially struggled and distributed fruits, but all were instructed by the landlords to deceive the leadership and the peasants. Some landlords did give the poor a few acres of poor land, but kept a large amount of good land for themselves, or hid it in the homes of relatives and friends. The landlord of Dongshi Village still retained 300 acres of good land, the landlord of Xinchang Village retained 400 acres, and the landlords of backward villages in the Second District hid more than 50 hectares of land. During the in-depth movement, the county took "attacking the backward, eliminating feudal remnants" as its slogan, and was determined to mobilize more than 500 county and district cadres and activists from advanced villages to form work teams. These people were mostly peasant cadres familiar with the situation in backward villages. They first convened a conference of poor peasants and farm laborers from various villages with more than 2,000 people, taking the district or base point as a unit, organized typical grievance sessions, and aroused the peasants' strong hatred for feudal forces and their understanding and recognition of the powerful strength of the peasants. After the conference, they went deep into the backward villages, abandoned the village cadres appointed by the landlords, and directly sought out the poor peasants and farm laborers who participated in the conference or other peasants with the most grievances to brew and pour out their grievances, and then let them use bitterness to attract bitterness, colluding with all the poor peasants and farm laborers. Subsequently, many poor peasant groups were formed, becoming the backbone of the movement, and then they were enlightened and guided to lead the middle peasants to pour out their grievances, and finally formed a powerful peasant front, unanimously launching a general liquidation struggle against landlords and local bullies, taking back all the land and property looted, and exposing the crimes of landlords and local bullies in hiding and dispersing land and property and suppressing the emancipation of the peasants. The landlord of Wangjia Village organized fake struggles, fake beatings, and fake distributions; the landlord of Zhaogu Village changed the poor into new clothes, and even put on sweaters to confuse the work team, and met them with a set of auspicious words of "completely turned over"; the village cadres of Liyanzhuang who were bought off organized the masses to fake struggle, and arranged in advance to "act according to my wink"; the cadres of ×× Village who were bought off threatened the peasants with "whoever leaks the news will be smashed to death," preventing them from approaching the work team. But all these traps and tricks were exposed after the peasants rose up. The awakened peasants said: "Our village could not be emancipated. We used to say that it was bad luck, but now we understand that it was the landlords who were making trouble!" The bad cadres in the backward villages have been dismissed by the peasants after the struggle, and replaced by the leading peasants in the struggle; some have also automatically repented to the peasants and guaranteed that they will no longer be lackeys for the landlords. In the process of leveling up and filling gaps, they are generally taken care of appropriately, giving them a chance to start anew. (Yang Ziping)

　　邢台落后村全部突破
    雇贫为骨干团结中农展开总清算
    挖出地主恶霸隐藏大量土地资财
    【本报邢台讯】邢台县于去年十二月大规模翻身检查后，经两月来的深入运动，五十多个落后村的封建堡垒均已突破，使全县运动走向平衡，全面转入填平补齐阶段。该县深入运动的特点：一是大规模的以贫雇农为骨干团结中农向地主恶霸斗争。二是从深入的思想发动到集中的清算斗争。许多落后村在深入运动之前，都是地主委派爪牙充当各系统干部，原封不动的保持着封建统治。有些村也表面上斗争过，分过果实，但都是地主授意以欺骗领导、欺骗农民。有的地主也真给了穷人几亩薄地，但大量好地仍据为己有，或隐蔽在亲友家里。东石村地主仍保有好地三百亩，心长村地主保有四百亩，二区落后村地主隐藏了五十多顷地。该县在深入运动时，以“突击落后、扫除封建尾巴”为口号，下决心调集了五百多个县区干部与先进村干部积极分子，组成工作队。这些人多是熟悉落后村情形的农民干部。他们首先以区或基点为单位，召开两千人以上的各村贫雇农大会，组织典型诉苦，激发起农民对封建势力的强烈憎恨与对农民强大力量的体会与认识。大会之后，即深入到落后村中，抛开地主委派的村干，直接找参加大会的贫雇农或其他苦水最多的农民来酝酿、诉苦，又让他们去以苦引苦，串通所有贫雇农。随即组成许多贫雇小组，成为运动骨干，进而启发诱导他们去引中农倒苦水，最后形成强大的农民阵线，一致展开对地主恶霸的总清算斗争，夺回被掠去之所有土地财物，揭发地主恶霸隐藏分散之土地财物与压制农民翻身的罪行。王家庄地主组织假斗争、假打、假分；赵孤庄地主给穷人换上新衣服，甚至穿上毛衣去迷惑工作队，见面就是一套“翻透身了”的吉祥话；李演庄被收买的村干组织群众假斗争时，事先布置好“看我眼色行事”；××村被收买的干部以“谁透气砸死谁”威胁农民，不让与工作队接近。但所有这些圈套与诡计，都在农民起来之后揭露无余。觉醒了的农民说：“咱村翻不了身，以前咱说是命不好，现在才懂得是地主们捣鬼！”落后村的坏干部斗争后，已被农民罢免，换上斗争中的带头农民；也有一部分自动向农民悔过自新，保证以后不再给地主当狗腿。填平补齐中，一般都适当照顾了他们，给以重新做人的机会。（杨子平）
