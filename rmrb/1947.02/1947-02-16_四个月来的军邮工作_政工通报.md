　　Four Months of Military Postal Work
    ——Political Work Bulletin
Around the time of the Longhai Campaign last year, providing and transporting spiritual food and propaganda materials to the front-line combat troops, as well as sending reports from the troops to the journalist corps and newspaper offices, encountered great difficulties. The difficulty was not the lack of materials, but rather the accumulation of materials in the rear or at the front, unable to be sent out or received. Combat troops often suffered from a lack of publications and newspapers to read, and reports and communications written by troops and journalists could not be delivered to the newspaper office in a timely manner. Initially, we contacted the local post office to discuss mailing methods and used the garrison line for transshipment, but neither could solve the problem. The reason was that the combat troops were constantly marching and transferring, and the personnel of the garrison line had no specific responsibility for this task, making it difficult to deliver. Furthermore, although there were specialized correspondents in the troops, their numbers were too small to regularly deliver large quantities of spiritual food and propaganda materials to the front. After discussing this general issue at the joint conference of the Propaganda and Education Department of the Jiluyu District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office following the Longhai Campaign, it was decided to establish military postal offices in each combat unit. The organization involved setting up a general military postal office near the relatively stable local wartime service headquarters, and a military postal branch office for each combat column (the Jiluyu Military Region Independent Brigade also had a branch office). The general military postal office moved with the wartime service headquarters, maintaining contact with the postal administration bureau in the rear on the one hand, and with the branch offices in each column on the other hand. The military postal branch offices moved with each combat column. The general military postal office had one director, one secretary, one dispatcher, one distributor, and more than ten messengers; each branch office had one director and several messengers (five to nine people), and a sub-station was set up in the headquarters. These military postal workers were all drawn from local post offices. Because they were all personnel from local post offices, most of whom had worked in quiet environments in the past, and because they lacked combat experience, these comrades inevitably felt some discomfort in their work and life at the beginning of the military postal service, and showed some unfamiliarity, inexperience, and helplessness. Sometimes, as soon as the troops moved, the military postal offices lost contact with each other. In late October, a joint meeting of the directors of each military postal office was held to: (1) review the past work and absorb past experiences; (2) reassign personnel and transfer out those who were truly unqualified. Later, the headquarters issued a notice stipulating that the material supply of the military postal service was entirely the responsibility of the army (shoes were issued to the communication personnel, and livestock feed was the same as for the cavalry livestock), and the management and education of its personnel was entirely the responsibility of the unit in which they were located, with the general military postal office only responsible for business guidance. In addition, after being tempered by a period of objective war environment, the comrades in the military postal work broke their peaceful mindset and created methods to complete their tasks in their work, such as establishing temporary transit stations between the two bureaus, the contact method after the troops transferred, the letter-leaving method for finding contact, and the method of directly distributing newspapers to brigades and various departments to ensure that everyone could quickly get newspapers to read. Now the enthusiasm of the military postal messengers has generally improved, some can travel more than 130 li a day, and every day someone goes to the general military postal office. This allows things from the rear to be quickly sent to the front, and things from the front to be quickly sent back to the rear, ensuring that the combat troops can continuously see newspapers, and that the communication reports from the front can be delivered to the journalist corps and newspaper offices in a timely manner, so that time-sensitive things will not lose their timeliness. The general letters of the troops and the home letters of the soldiers were also sent quickly. When a certain column counterattacked Liaocheng, they received newspapers transferred from the Shandong Military Region and saw the experience of the Shandong troops attacking fortifications, which increased the courage of the troops to fight. Comrades in other columns said that in the past, troops could not see newspapers during combat, but now this problem has been solved.
    Now the work of the military postal service has made great progress. If its leadership can be further improved and better assistance can be obtained from the troops (especially the propaganda and education departments and communication work comrades), the achievements of future work will surely be even greater.

　　四个月来的军邮工作
    ——政工通报
    去年陇海战役前后，对前线作战部队精神食粮和对敌宣传品的供给和输送，以及部队中的报导稿件向记者团报社的寄送都发生很大的困难，这个困难不是在于没有东西，而是在于东西积压于后方或前线，送不出去，寄不上来。作战部队常常苦于没有刊物报纸阅读，部队中及记者写的报导材料与通讯亦苦于无法及时送到报社，我们最初曾经与地方邮局接洽邮寄办法，及利用兵站线转运的办法，但都不能解决问题，原因就是作战部队经常不断的行军转移，而兵站线的人员又无此项专责，所以不易寄到。此外部队中虽有专门的通讯员，但因人数太少，定期的大批输送精神食粮和宣传品到前方去，他们的力量是办不到的。陇海战役后，在冀鲁豫区党委军区行署的宣教联席会议上讨论了这个总题以后，才决定在各个作战部队中建立随军邮局的办法。其组织是在比较安定的地方战勤指挥部附近设一个军邮总局，每一个作战纵队设一个军邮分局（冀鲁豫军区独立旅也设了一个分局）。军邮总局随战勤指挥部行动，一方面与后方邮务管理局保持联系，另一方面与各个纵队上的分局保持联系，军邮分轮则随各作战纵队行动。军邮总局设局长一人，秘书一人，收发员一人，发行员一人，交通员十余人；各分局设局长一人，交通员数人（五人到九人），本部设一分站，这些军邮工作人员都是从地方邮局抽出来的。由于他们都是地方邮局的人员，过去大都是在安静环境中工作，同时他们也缺乏战斗经验。军邮建立的开始，这些同志在工作和生活上难免感到一些不习惯，和表现出一些生疏无经验没办法的地方，有时部队一行动，军邮间即失掉联系。十月下旬召开各军邮局长联席会。（一）检讨了过去的工作，吸收了过去的经验；（二）重新配备人员，并把实在不称职的人员，调出了军邮。后来本部又颁发了通知，规定军邮的物质供给完全归军队负责（发鞋与通讯人员同，发牲口料与骑兵的牲口同）及其人员的管理教育，完全由于所在单位负责，军邮总局只负业务指导的责任。加以受了一个时期客观战争环境的锻炼，使军邮工作同志打破了和平观念以后，在工作上创造出了完成任务的办法，如两局之间设立临时的过渡站，部队转移后的接头法，寻找联系的留信法，又如直接分送报纸到旅及各个部门，以求大家迅速得到报纸看的方法等；现在军邮交通员的积极性一般都提高了，有的一日能行一百三十多里，并每日有人赴军邮总局去。这样使后方的东西能很快送往前方，使前方的东西亦能很快送回后方，保证了作战部队不断看到报纸，和前线的通讯报导材料能及时送到记者团和报社，因此有时间性的东西也就不会失掉时间性了。部队上的一般信件和战士们的家信也得到了很快的寄送。某纵队在反击聊城时，接到转去的山东军区的报纸，见到山东部队攻坚的经验，增加了部队作战的勇气，其他纵队的同志都说过去部队一作战就看不到报纸，现在这个问题解决了。
    现在随军邮局的工作已有了很大的进步，若更能改善其领导，更好的得到部队方面的协助（特别是宣教部门及通讯工作同志），今后的工作成绩一定会更大的。
