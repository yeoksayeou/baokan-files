　　Bold and Careful
    ——The Story of Zhao Chuan's Guerrilla Unit
    Guang Zu
      This happened in December of last year. Zhao Chuan, a hero in killing the enemy, led his guerrilla unit through layers of enemy blockades and advanced into Beixiang Town. They walked along the road in small groups of twos and threes, looking like they were going to a market in Beixiang Town.
    Beixiang is a large town west of Yuncheng. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet district government and the "Love the Homeland Corps," relying on their solid fortifications and strategic location, were arrogantly stationed there, wantonly ravaging the people. They never imagined that Zhao Chuan's guerrilla unit would come here to "shop" at the market. Comrade Zhao Chuan led the troops all the way to the entrance of the town, reorganized them, and marched in with orderly steps, shouting: "One, two, three, four." They passed proudly through the center of the street.
    Some people at the market recognized Zhao Chuan and whispered, "Zhao Chuan is here, Zhao Chuan is here." The communicator immediately alerted Zhao Chuan, "Some people recognize you." But he ignored it. "One, two, three, four." He shouted even louder.
    The rear part of the unit remained on the main street, while the front part leisurely went to the blockhouse to find acquaintances. Zhao Chuan himself led a part of the team to rest at the entrance of the puppet government office. One soldier recognized the sentry at the entrance of the district office, and the two started chatting: "You're here, which unit are you with?" "The Love the Homeland Corps!" the soldier replied naturally. And he said, "Is there any water? Our troops have been marching all night and are very thirsty." The sentry said, "Tell them all to come and drink." "Dare they come in? Aren't you afraid the district chief will scold you?" "No, the district chief is playing cards, as long as it's not a riot." So five of them混进the yard, and slowly some slipped into the rooms on both sides, each keeping an eye on their task.
    When the smoke signal was released from the blockhouse, Comrade Zhao Chuan immediately made a gesture to everyone, preparing to take care of the enemies in the houses on both sides. He himself nimbly stepped into the north room, followed by several soldiers. The puppet district chief was engrossed in playing cards and paid no attention. Zhao Chuan said, "Let me make a phone call, okay?" The district chief said casually, "Go ahead, it's in the room inside." Comrade Zhao Chuan quickly cut the phone line. Turning around, he ordered, "Tie them up one by one!" In this way, the puppet district government was taken care of. When the team assembled, there were twenty-seven prisoners in total. The soldiers smiled humorously and said, "This trip to the market wasn't bad, we didn't spend a penny and brought back so many 'New Year's goods'."

　　胆大心细
    ——赵川游击队的故事
    光祖
  	  这是去年十二月的事情，杀敌英雄赵川同志带领着游击队穿过敌人层层封锁线挺进北向镇。三三两两在大路上走着，象是去北向镇赶集的。
    北向是运城西的大镇，蒋伪的区公所和爱乡团，仗恃坚固工事和险要地势，傲然驻扎在那里，肆意蹂躏人民。他们想不到赵川游击队要来这里赶集“办货”。赵川同志把队伍一直带到镇口，又整理了一下，迈着整齐的步伐，喊着：“一，二，三，四。”昂然地从街心穿过去。
    集上有些人认识赵川，低声地说：“赵川来了，赵川来了。”通讯员立即给赵川打了个招呼，“有人认识你。”可是他不理会。“一，二，三，四。”喊得更响亮。
    后面一部分留在正街上，前面的赖洋洋地到碉堡找熟人。赵川自己带着一部分队员在伪公所大门口休息。一个战士认得区公所门口的哨兵，两人闲拉起来：“你来了，现在那一部分？”“爱乡团”！战士很自然地回答了。并说：“有水吗？咱们部队行了一夜军，都渴坏了。”哨兵说：“叫他们都来喝吧。”“敢进吗？不怕区长骂？”“不，区长在打牌，只要不是叱虎就行。”于是一下五个都混进院子，慢慢地有的钻进两侧的住室，每个人都在留心自己的任务。
    碉堡上放了烟信号，赵川同志立即向大家做一个手势，准备解决两边房子的敌人。他自己便敏捷的踏进北房，后面跟着几个战士。伪区长牌兴正浓，没有理会。赵川说：“让我打个电话吧？”区长不在意地说：“打吧，在里边房里。”赵川同志迅速地弄断了电话线。转出来下命令说：“给我一个一个捆起来！”就这样把伪区公所解决了。队伍集合时，共有二十七个俘虏。战士们幽默地笑着说：“这次赶集还不坏，没花一个本钱，就办回这么多‘年货’。”
