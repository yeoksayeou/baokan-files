    Closely Integrated With the Turn-Over Movement
    Taihang Winter Schools Deepen into Mountain Villages
    Since the beginning of winter, winter schools in various parts of Taihang have been combined with mass movements to conduct in-depth turn-over education and current affairs education for the masses. In some counties, winter schools have penetrated into mountain villages and remote settlements, playing a significant role in enlightening the masses and promoting the turn-over movement. Baituan Village in She County is located on the border and work started relatively late. Since the village established a winter school last November, it has soon expanded to four schools. More than 360 men and women have voluntarily enrolled. Learning is coordinated with checking reductions [of rent] and filling gaps [between rich and poor], which greatly enhances the awareness of the masses. Learning is led by volunteer teachers, adopting a conversational approach, discussing the issues of filling gaps and making up deficiencies in the village. Such as what is filling gaps and making up deficiencies? Who should be leveled? Who should be made up? How to achieve filling gaps and making up deficiencies? Who should be struggled against? Who should be united? How to struggle? How to unite? In the teaching process, volunteer teachers are both teachers and students. After the masses have fully understood each issue, they make a simple summary. Problems that have not been clarified are raised, allowing the masses to go home and consider them, preparing for the next discussion. This learning method is both relaxed and practical. The masses are very supportive. Each winter school is specifically responsible by a cadre. Before class every night, all the cadres hold a teaching preparation meeting to discuss the learning content for that evening. There has also been great success in cultural learning. Originally, only three people in the village could write promissory notes and contracts, now 32 people can write them, and 25 people have learned abacus addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More young people and children are entering schools.
    Sanguanmiao in the First District of Hui County belongs to 42 natural villages, all of which are small mountain villages with three to five or ten families, totaling 124 households with 716 men and women. The entire village is divided into eight winter schools according to the natural terrain of the mountain gullies. Each winter school has one volunteer teacher and one village cadre, jointly forming a winter school committee, taking turns to help lead in each winter school. The winter school is divided into male and female classes, and the teaching content is mainly turn-over, combined with literacy. Each winter school discusses turn-over, expressing grievances, and making suggestions. The people of the village who are to be struggled against, that winter school first individually expresses grievances. When it is mature, it combines together to hold a mass meeting to struggle. In this way, the actions and opinions of the masses in each village are completely unified, and at the same time, it overcomes the phenomenon that small villages with few people cannot carry out struggle. No matter who is struggled against, the masses of each mountain village support each other. Therefore, both the winter schools and the mass movement are doing very well, and the masses have turned themselves over. Seven military dependents and dozens of poor peasant families have obtained land, and some have risen from extreme poverty to middle peasants.
    Women were afraid to speak when they first went to winter school. After organizing spinning and weaving and winter school education, the women's awareness has also improved. They participated in the struggle like men and shared the fruits.

    密切结合翻身运动
    太行冬学深入山庄
    入冬以来，太行各地冬学与群运结合，普遍地对群众进行了深入的翻身教育、时事教育；有些县份，冬学深入到山庄窝铺，对启发群众觉悟推进翻身运动上起了很大作用。涉县白芟村地处边陲，工作开展较迟，自去年十一月该村创冬学一所，不久又扩充为四所。男女三百六十余人都自愿地报了名。学习与查减配合，大大地提高群众觉悟。学习由义务教员领导，采漫谈方式，讨论该村填平补齐诸问题。如什么是填平补齐？填平谁？补齐谁？怎样做到填平补齐？谁该斗争？谁该团结？怎样斗争？怎样团结等。义务教员在教学过程中，既当先生，又当学生。每个问题等群众酝酿明白后，作简单总结。把没有弄清楚的问题提出，让群众回家考虑，准备下次讨论。这种学习方式既轻松，又实际。群众非常拥护。每一处冬学由一干部专门负责。每晚上课前该会全体干部举行一教学准备会，讨论当晚学习内容。在文化学习上也有很大成绩。原来全村只有三人会写路条文约，现已有三十二人会写，有二十五人学会珠算加减乘除，青年儿童入学的更多。
    辉县一区三官庙，共属四十二个自然村，全是三五家十几家的小山庄，总共一百二十四户，男女共七百一十六人。全村以山沟的自然形势分设八个冬学。各冬学有义务教员、村干部各一人，共同组织冬学委员会，轮流到各冬学帮助领导，冬学分男女两班，教学内容主要是翻身，结合识字，各冬学讨论翻身诉苦提意见。斗争那个庄的人，那个冬学就先个别诉苦，酝酿成熟时，就结合一起开大会斗争。这样各庄的群众行动和意见完全统一，同时也克服了庄小人少斗不起来的现象。不论斗争谁，各山庄群众都互相声援。所以冬学和群众运动都搞的很好，群众已翻起身来。七户军属与数十家贫农都得到了土地，有的已由赤贫升到中农。
    妇女开始上冬学不敢说话，经过组织纺织，冬学教育，妇女们觉悟也提高了。和男人一样参加斗争分到了果实。
