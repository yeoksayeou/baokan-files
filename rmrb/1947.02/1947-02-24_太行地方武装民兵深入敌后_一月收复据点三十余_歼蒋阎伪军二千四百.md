　　Taihang Local Armed Militia Penetrates Deep Behind Enemy Lines
    Recovers Over Thirty Strongholds in One Month
    Annihilates 2,400 Chiang, Yan, and Puppet Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 22nd] Local armed forces and militia in the Taihang border area have penetrated deep into areas occupied by Chiang's troops, recovering vast villages and towns, and igniting guerrilla warfare around Chiang's important strongholds. According to incomplete statistics, there were over a hundred major battles in January, recovering over thirty strongholds and annihilating 2,399 Chiang, Yan troops and local bandits. The weapons seized were enough to equip ten companies. On the southern front in northern Henan, in Pingxian, Anyang, Tangyin, Ji, Qi, and other counties west of the Pinghan Railway, nearly a hundred strongholds and villages have been recovered this month, including Zhang Park in Tangyin, Miaokou Town in Qi County, Sanwenying in Huojia, and Fangwei in Ji County. After recovering the strongholds of Dahu Bridge in Wuzhi, Erxian Temple in Qinyang, and Xijincheng in Boai along the road on the 21st, Wen County was also recovered on the 22nd; now south of the Daoqing Road, all the vast villages and towns on both sides of the Qin River have been completely recovered. On the northern front, guerrilla warfare around Shijiazhuang is becoming increasingly active. Militias in the border areas of Gaoyi in western Hebei, and Pingding and Taigu in central Shanxi, successively annihilated 200 Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops who invaded. From the 5th to the 12th, the Shouyang County Independent Battalion, in coordination with the militia, launched attacks and bombings, crushing the offensive of five regiments of Yan troops towards the hinterland of Shouyang; now, except for the village of Hedi, there are no enemy traces in the liberated area. In Yuci, Qixian, and other places, twelve strongholds were also recovered last month.
