　　People in War Zone Accuse Chiang's Troops of Crimes
    Our Army Vows to Avenge the People
    [Special Dispatch] When I and the political department were stationed in a village on the front lines of the Jilu-Yu region, people from dozens of miles around came with gifts to show their appreciation to the army. Several old women, hobbling on crutches, shouted as they entered the square: "We are here to accuse the Fifth Army! We are here to accuse the Fifth Army! Comrades, you must avenge us!" All the officers and soldiers of our army quickly lined up to welcome them. An old woman stood in front of the ranks, gnashing her teeth, and accused the Jiang army of its atrocities, saying: "Those grandsons of the Fifth Army came to our house, took away our pots, dragged away our people, cut down all our trees, and even made the women take off their clothes and dance the Yangko. All the women! They were all violated by them…" She choked and could not speak any further. Hatred filled the hearts of every soldier, and they angrily shouted: "Resolutely wipe out the Fifth Army to avenge our mothers!" The accusations continued. When Chen Shuxiang's mother spoke of her daughter being captured by the Fifth Army, she could not cry. The village chief of Mazhai said: "Women in Yutai over the age of eighteen and under the age of forty were all raped. One villager's wife was raped, and when he reported it to the Chiang army officer, he was shot dead. Any good girl who was pretty, they would forcibly cut off her hair, saying she was a captured Eighth Route Army worker." He beat his chest and stamped his feet as he continued: "The children's corps leader of Quli Store, who was in his teens, was captured. The enemy forced him to reveal the names of the village cadres, but the child did not say a single name until he was shot… People can't live there anymore, they all want to fight to the death. When you came, old and young alike repeatedly said to us: When you see our army, please ask them to come quickly!" Hearing this, platoon leaders Ma Yunsheng and Ma Qingyun could no longer bear it and jumped up, saying: "The old women are our mothers, we must avenge our mothers! We will meet the Fifth Army on the battlefield!" Combat hero Zhang Xuefa gnashed his teeth and said: "Who doesn't have a sister, who doesn't have a sense of honor? In the next battle, my squad must take down a few more of them!" Company instructor Wang Jianxiu and combat hero Dong Baode stood up, tears streaming down their faces, and shouted loudly: "Who are we fighting for? To not avenge is to forget our roots!" They called on their company to strive for success. Company commander Wang Haijin, on behalf of the entire company, requested the task of attacking. The flames of revenge burned in the winter fields.

　　战地群众控诉蒋军罪行
    我军誓为人民复仇
    【本报特讯】我和政部驻在冀鲁豫前线某村时，附近几十里路的群众纷纷拿着礼物来劳军，几个拄着拐杖的老大娘一走进广场就喊：“俺是告五军的呀！俺是告五军的呀！同志得给俺报仇！”我军全体指战员迅速列队欢迎，一个老大娘站在队伍前面，咬牙切齿地在控诉蒋军的暴行说：“五军那些龟孙到来俺家，锅揭走，人拉走，树锯光，还要娘们脱衣裳扭秧歌，所有的女人呀！都叫他们糟蹋了……。”她哽咽的再也说不出话来了。仇恨充满着每个战士的心，愤怒地喊出：“坚决消灭五军给咱大娘报仇！”控诉继续下去，当陈书香娘说到她闺女叫五军抓走时，哭不出声，马寨村长说：“鱼台头十八岁以上，四十岁以下的妇女都被轮奸了。一个老乡的老婆被强奸，他去报告蒋军的官长，却被枪毙了。谁家好女孩子长的漂亮，就强把头发剪掉，说是捉的八路军工作人员。”他椎胸顿足接着说下去：“曲礼店十几岁的儿童团长被捉住后，敌人逼他说出村干部姓名，小孩子一直到枪毙，也没说出一个名字来。……在那里人们是无法活了，都想拼命，我们来了，老老少少都同我们再三的说：见了咱的军队，千万请他们快来呀！”听到这里，排长马云生、马青云再也忍耐不住了，跳起来说：“老大娘就是咱们的母亲，要给母亲报仇啊！战场上和五军见面！”战斗英雄张学发咬牙切齿的说：“谁家没有姐和妹，谁没有血性，下次战斗我这一班一定要多干掉它几个！”某连指导员王见修、战斗英雄董保得站起来，泪珠横流，大声疾呼：“咱们出来为谁？有仇不报是忘本！”他们号召自己连队要争气。一连长王海金代表全连要求进攻任务。复仇的烈火燃烧在冬天的原野。（朱波）
