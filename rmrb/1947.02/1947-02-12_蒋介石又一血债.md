Short essay:

    Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal and water release have already caused significant losses to the people of the Jilu-Yu region. Recently, this vicious traitor and public enemy has intensified his actions by strafing our dike repair personnel and peaceful residents in the riverbank areas with airplanes. Today's newspaper reports that Chiang's planes strafed our dike repair workers and residents passing along the old course of the Yellow River in Shouzhang, Yunbei, and Fanxian counties, resulting in 64 deaths and injuries in five days. The dike repair workers forcibly building dikes in Machang, Nanhua, were also brutally murdered by Chiang's troops, resulting in ten deaths and injuries, and more than 600 catties of hemp rope used for dike repair were looted. In Kunwu alone, more than 30 people died from drowning and freezing in four or five days due to the overflowing Yellow River.

    These facts nakedly expose Chiang Kai-shek's true face to the world. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda organs devised all sorts of "reasons" to defend his crime of releasing water. Now everyone can see why he stubbornly went back on his word to release water. Now everyone can see why Chiang Kai-shek broke the agreements time and again, and delayed the payment of labor and materials needed for dike restoration and rescue, as well as the resettlement fees for residents. He dispatched large armies to attack the people of the liberated areas, and when the military situation turned unfavorable, he released water to flood the people of the liberated areas. When these people rose up to save themselves, he indiscriminately strafed them with airplanes. We hope that international and domestic people of justice will pay serious attention to these crimes.

    The people's blood must not be shed in vain. The people of our entire region protest this atrocity with grief and indignation, and like the people of the Taiyue region, we will launch a broad and enthusiastic support movement for the disaster-stricken people along the river. We should better carry out production and frugality, and provide these disaster-stricken people with material assistance. The most important thing is to grit our teeth and do everything we can to defeat the invading Chiang troops, because this is the root cause of the people's suffering. The blood debt created by Chiang Kai-shek must be repaid with blood!

### 蒋介石又一血债

    蒋介石又一血债
    蒋介石背信放水，已给我冀鲁豫人民造成重大损失，最近这个恶毒的卖国贼和人民公敌，竟变本加厉，在沿河地区以飞机扫射我方修堤人员及和平居民了。今日报载：蒋机在沿寿张、郓北、范县黄河故道扫射我方修堤员工及来往居民，五天内死伤即达六十四人。南华马厂强修堤防的员工，也遭蒋军残杀，死伤十人，并抢去修堤所用的麻绳六百多斤。昆吾一地，在四五天内因黄水横流被淹死冻死的就有三十多人。
    这些事实向全世界赤裸裸揭露出蒋介石的真面目。过去蒋介石的御用机关想出一切“理由”来为他的放水罪行辩护。现在谁都可以看见，他固执地背信放水倒底是为什么了。现在谁都可以看见蒋介石破坏历次协议，拖欠复堤抢险所需要的工款物资及居民迁移费倒底是为什么了。他调遣大军进攻解放区人民，当军事失利的时候又放水来淹解放区人民，而当这些人民起来自救的时候，又用飞机横加扫射，这些罪行，我们希望国际及国内正义人士加以严正注意。
    人民的血，绝不能白流。我全区人民以悲愤的心情抗议这种暴行，并且如太岳区人民一样，将对沿河难胞展开广泛热烈的支援运动。我们应更好的进行生产节约，给这些难胞以物质援助。最主要的是要咬紧牙关，拿出一切力量打败进犯的蒋军，因为这是人民灾难的总根源。蒋介石造成的血债必须要他用血来偿还！
