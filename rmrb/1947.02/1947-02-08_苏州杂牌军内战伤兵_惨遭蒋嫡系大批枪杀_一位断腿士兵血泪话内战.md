Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The Shanghai Masses Weekly published on January 7th carried a "Suzhou Dispatch" stating: On January 23rd, a group of wounded soldiers in Suzhou were massacred by Chiang's direct lineage 202nd Division. Corpses littered the streets, and blood and flesh splattered everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Afterwards, the wounded soldiers were also arrested by military police. According to a legless soldier, formerly of the ×× Brigade, who recounted the incident: "Several new brothers were in low spirits and went to the small park theater to watch a play and relax. Unexpectedly, they were beaten by soldiers of the 202nd Division. They returned to the team crying and said, 'It's unbearable to be humiliated like this.' The entire team of thousands of people unanimously disagreed and clamored to seek justice. When everyone arrived at the entrance of the small park theater, American-style submachine guns opened fire on us. Machine guns on the Great Light Building and the YMCA building fired in a crossfire." The wounded soldier continued indignantly, "We were unarmed, why would they shoot us? The Communist Party always treats prisoners of war with leniency and has always treated wounded enemy soldiers very well; but here, we were met with machine guns!" Not to mention, the boy named Zhang Qinghan, a twenty-one-year-old lad, joined the army two months before the victory. I personally saw him clutching his stomach and collapsing just now. When he left home, his wife told me to take care of him! He didn't die during the War of Resistance, nor did he die in the civil war, but now he died like this, don't you think it's a grievance?" The wounded soldier continued to talk about the situation of their unit on the front lines of the civil war, saying: "When our unit began to head north, the brothers secretly spread the word that we were going to fight the common people, and many deserted. At the Mid-Autumn Festival, we arrived at a small market near the Fairy Temple. The Communist army was defending two miles across. The superiors ordered us to advance, with ×× Town as the target. A large number of central army and military police rushed to set up a cordon behind us. Only then did the brothers realize what was happening. It turned out that we were being forced to be cannon fodder, fighting on the front lines! We were being monitored, and we had to kill our own people. As soon as we hesitated, our hand softened, the bullets would be aimed at us from behind. Our entire brigade ran more than ten miles in one breath without encountering any resistance, but when we broke into people's homes, we couldn't find a single grain of rice. Suddenly, a large number of Communist troops appeared from the side. Machine gun bullets and field artillery shells rained down like rain. We were terrified. The brothers saw that the situation was gone and refused to die in this civil war, so they laid down their guns and crossed over. The brigade commander couldn't stop them and had to lead a few hundred people to escape through small paths. I myself am one of these few hundred people." The wounded soldier pointed to his leg and said, "I still remember that it was an older sister who shot me in the mulberry tree pile. The common people hated us to death. Everyone beat us, which is right, we invaded them. Even during the War of Resistance, I have never seen the people so brave and with such strength." He continued: "We are not afraid of death, we just see if it's worth it! In the past, when fighting the Japanese, I also wore flowers on my head, almost died. In the hospital, I always thought about getting well and going to fight the devils again. Now, there is no reason to speak of, going to fight people for no reason, going to kill the peaceful and happy people, why would we be willing to fight this kind of senseless war and suffer this kind of senseless injury?" He returned to the bloody massacre by the 202nd Division, but his words were interrupted when he was taken away by armed military police who had arrived.

    苏州杂牌军内战伤兵
    惨遭蒋嫡系大批枪杀
    一位断腿士兵血泪话内战
    【新华社延安六日电】一月七日出版之上海群众周刊载“苏州通讯”称：一月二十三日，苏州一部伤兵遭蒋嫡系二○二师大批枪杀，街上尸体横陈，血肉四溅，惨不忍睹。事后，伤兵并遭宪兵逮捕。据伤兵中原属××旅之一断腿士兵叙述此事经过称：“几个新来的弟兄心境不好，去小公园戏院看戏解闷，不料被二○二师的兵打了，回到队里大哭说：“这样给人侮辱，实在做不得人了。满队千百人一古脑儿不答应，起来闹着要去评理。大伙儿走到小公园戏院门口，美式冲锋枪就向我们打将来，大光明楼上、青年会楼上两面机枪交叉射击”。该伤兵愤慨地接着说：“我们是手无寸铁的人呀，凭什么来枪毙我们呢？共产党对俘虏一律优待，对被俘虏的敌方的伤兵一向招待得很好；然而在这里，我们却吃到机关枪了”！别的不说，只是叫张清汉的那孩子二十一岁的小伙子呐，胜利前两个月入伍的，刚才是我亲自看到他捧着肚子倒下去了。离家时，他女人还关照我照应他呢！抗战时不死，内战中又未战死，现在这样死，你说冤不冤呢？该伤兵接着谈到他们部队在内战前线的情形说：“当我们部队开始朝北开时，弟兄们间就悄悄地传说是去打老百姓，不少便开了小差。中秋节开到仙女庙附近一个小集上，对面二里路就有中共军防守，上峰命令前进，以××镇为目标，大批中央军、宪兵都赶到，在我们后面布置了警戒网，弟兄们这时才觉到这是怎么一回事了，原来要逼我们去当炮灰，拚火线！给人家监视，去杀自己人，只要一犹豫，手一软，那子弹就会在后面瞄准我们。我们一旅人一鼓气跑了十多里，没有受到丝毫抵抗，但打进人家去，一个人一粒米也找不到。突然，斜刺里大批共军出现了，机枪弹、野战炮弹像雨般轰来，我们被吓得魂不附体，弟兄们一看大势已去，不肯在这内战中丧命，放下枪杆过去了，旅长也阻止不住，只好带了几百人从小路逃回去。我自己也是这几百人中的一个。该伤兵指着他的腿说：“我还记得这是一个大姐儿在桑树堆打我一枪打的，他们老百姓恨死了我们，谁都打我们，这是应该的，我们侵犯了他们。即使在抗战中，我也没有看到人民这样勇敢，有这样的力量”。他接着说：我们并不是怕死，只要看这些值不值得！过去打日本，我也带过花，在头角上，几乎死了，在医院里总想到治好了，再去同鬼子拚命。现地却讲不出道理来，无缘无故去打人家，去杀死安居乐业的老百姓，我们何尝愿意去打这种无缘无故的鸟仗，受这种无缘无故的鸟伤呢”？他话又回到眼前二○二师屠杀他们的血案上来，但他的话未讲就被赶来的武装宪兵带走了。
