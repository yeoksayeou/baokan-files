　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Belated news. According to Associated Press and United Press dispatches from the 24th and 25th of last month, the U.S. Immigration Bureau in San Francisco detained approximately 200 Chinese people for an extended period, using the excuse that "there are not enough Americans, and there is not enough time to investigate." Among them was Dr. Wu, a Chinese scientist who was invited to the United States by Yale University. Even after Professor Hoke of Yale University sent a telegram to vouch for him, he was not released. The daughter of Mr. Li, an advisor to the Chiang Kai-shek government's delegation to the United Nations, and the daughter of Lin Yutang were also detained for two days and nights upon arrival in the United States by ship. Zhang Zichang, the Consul General of the Chiang Kai-shek government in San Francisco, went to negotiate with a letter, but was met with disdain. Zhang himself stated: "I held a letter from the Chinese Ambassador (referring to the ambassador sent by the Chiang Kai-shek government) requesting care for these two people and presented it to the Immigration Bureau, but it was ignored. I remained on the ship for two days and two nights, and they did not even deign to speak to me. This is the actual situation." He also stated: "More Americans are going to China than Chinese are coming to the United States. The Consulate General has, up to this point, permitted 7,702 Americans to go to China."

　　美国移民局
    无理拘留华人
    【新华社延安十四日电】迟到消息，据上月二十四、二十五两日美联社及合众社电，旧金山美国移民局以“美人手不多，一时不及调查”为借口，拘留中国人约二百名，历时甚久。其中有中国科学家武博士，系应耶鲁大学之邀请前往美国者，虽经耶鲁大学霍琪教授来电证明，亦未获释。蒋政府出席联合国代表团顾问李某之女儿及林语堂之女儿乘船抵美，亦被拘留两日夜。蒋政府驻旧金山总领事张紫常持函前往交涉，备遭白眼。张自称：“余持有中国大使（指蒋政府所派之大使）要求照顾此两人之函件面交移民局，被置不理。余留在船上两日两夜，若辈意不屑与余一语，此乃实际情形。”又称：“美国人去华较中国人来美者为多，总领事馆至此刻为止已许可七千七百零二个美国人赴华。”
