The Border Government Full Committee
Sends Letter of Condolence to Cadres Persisting in Border Area Struggle and Supporting Farmers' Emancipation

[This newspaper reports] The Border Region Government Full Committee recently sent a letter of condolence to comrade cadres in various places who are supporting the farmers' emancipation. The original letter is as follows: To all administrative offices and special commissioner's offices, transferred to comrade cadres in all border areas and areas occupied by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops who are struggling hard and supporting the farmers' emancipation throughout the region:

Since Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war fully broke out, for more than half a year, our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has become one of the main attack directions of the invading Chiang troops. Many areas have suffered or are suffering from the ravages of Chiang's troops. Fortunately, our comrade workers in various places resolutely carry out their duty of serving the people, staying in the county, district, and even village, leading the local masses to carry out guerrilla warfare to defend the people's interests. In areas where land reform has already been carried out, they assist farmers in opposing landlord counter-settlements, protecting the people's vested interests from being lost due to the arrival of the enemy; in areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, they support farmers in taking up guns and dividing fields, so that the farmers' emancipation is not hindered by the arrival of the enemy, and their belief in victory is strengthened. In areas without war, they have more widely supported the emancipation of the vast number of farmers and carried out rent reduction movements. All of this has enabled more than two-thirds of the areas in our border region to basically realize the historical task of "land to the tillers." The full committee of this government, on behalf of the 30 million people, extends our heartfelt condolences to all comrades, and hopes that you will continue your efforts and achieve even greater success, striving to complete the full work of land reform before the spring ploughing, so as to turn to the large-scale production movement, guarantee the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, and promote the early realization of an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China. This is what we sincerely hope for!

      With best regards,
          The Full Committee of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, February 15th

　　边府全体委员
    函慰坚持边地斗争
    支援农民翻身干部
    【本报讯】边区政府全体委员，顷特致函慰勉各地支援农民翻身的干部同志，原函如下：各行署各专署转各边沿区蒋阎军侵占区艰苦奋斗及全区支援农民翻身的干部同志们：
    自从蒋介石卖国内战全面爆发，大半年来，我晋冀鲁豫边区已经成为进犯蒋军的主攻方向之一，不少地区都曾经遭受或正在遭受蒋军的蹂躏。幸赖我各地工作同志坚决执行为人民服务的天职，不离县不离区甚至不离村庄，领导当地群众开展游击战争，以卫护人民利益。在土地既经改革的地区，则援助农民反对地主倒算，保卫人民既得的果实，不因敌人的到来受到损失；在土地未经改革的地区，则支持农民一手拿枪、一手分田，使农民翻身不因敌人的到来受到阻碍，坚定了胜利信念。在没有战争的地区，则更普遍的支援了广大农民的翻身，进行了查减运动。一切这些，使我边区三分之二以上的地方都基本上实现了耕者有其田的历史任务。本府全体委员谨代表三千万人民向各同志致以衷心的慰问，并望再接再厉，功上加功，期于春耕前完成土地改革的全功，以便转入大生产运动，保证爱国自卫战争的胜利，促进独立和平民主新中国的早日实现。是所切盼！专此
      即致敬礼
          晋冀鲁豫边区政府全体委员  二月十五
