    [This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 3rd dispatch] After exposing the fake farmers' association in Guotaizi Village, Jibei, the peasants struggled against the landlord Sun Xuxian. Last spring, the Gaozhuang Farmers' Association in the third district of Wenshang was established. Sun feared that the poor masses in his village would rise up and turn over, so he bought off the village chief and a few hooligans to establish a fake farmers' association, which he controlled, giving the chairman wine and pocket money. In November, the district association proposed that the land return to the farmers. Sun Xuxian feared that the masses would rise up and ask him for land, so he divided half of the land (one hundred mu) to all the households in the village to cultivate, on the condition that: "If the Eighth Route Army is here, you can plant and eat it. If the Central Army comes, you will return it to me. If the Eighth Route Army is here, you won't do anything to me, but if the Central Army comes, I won't do anything to you." The masses were confused by his illusion. Before the new year, the leadership organized a land distribution training class, and most of the poor people in Guotaizi went to receive training. Their minds were turned around, and the idea of ​​changing the status quo was also broken. They understood the principle of returning land to the farmers. When they returned to the village, they contacted the masses from three villages, including Sanguanmiao, and united to turn themselves around. More than one hundred people from the four villages jointly reasoned with Sun Xuxian, exposed his conspiracies and tricks, exposed the hidden land, and distributed a lot of land to the masses.

    揭破地主假农会
    郭台农民闹翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】济北郭台子村，揭破假农会后，农民斗争了地主孙序贤。去年春天汶上三区高庄成立了农会，孙怕本村贫苦大众起来翻身，于是就收买村长和几个流氓成立假农会，由他把持，给会长酒喝零钱花。十一月区联提出土地回家，孙序贤怕群众起来向他要土地，便把一半的土地（一百亩）分给了全村花户耕种，条件是：“八路军在这里你种你吃，中央军来了你还给我，八路军在这里你不怎着我中央军来了我不怎着你”，群众就为他这一迷魂阵迷住了。年前领导上办了分地的训练班，郭台子的贫民大部都去受了训，心眼扭转过来，变天思想也打破了，懂得了土地回家的道理。回到村里联络了三官庙等三个村的群众，团结一块翻身，四个村的群众，一百多人，共同向孙序贤讲理，揭破他的阴谋诡计，把他隐瞒黑地揭发出来，又斗出不少土地，分给群众。
