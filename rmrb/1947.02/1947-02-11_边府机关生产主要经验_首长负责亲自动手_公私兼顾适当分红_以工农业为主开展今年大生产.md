Main Production Experiences of the Border Region Government Organs
    Leaders Take Charge and Work Personally
    Balancing Public and Private Interests with Appropriate Profit Sharing
    Focus on Industry and Agriculture to Launch This Year's Great Production Campaign
    [Our Newspaper] Last year, the Border Region Government organs achieved remarkable results in production. In agriculture, industry, transportation, and commerce, profits exceeded 12 million yuan, subsidizing government expenses by 9.6 million yuan, equivalent to 70% of the total annual expenditure. Most comrades received dividends ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 yuan per person, with the highest reaching 40,000 yuan. The reasons for this success are, first, balancing public and private interests with appropriate profit sharing. Initially, three people in the tofu workshop ground 20 jin of soybeans per day without any guarantees. Last autumn, the profit-sharing was changed to 20% for the public and 80% for the individual (now it is 30/70), and the daily grinding increased to 40 to 60 jin of soybeans. The tofu yield also increased from 1.125 jin per jin of soybeans to 2 jin. Because of the good quality of the tofu, the Central Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the villagers competed to buy it. In one and a half months last year, private dividends amounted to 45,000 yuan, and more than 100,000 yuan was handed over to the public. Other individual activities, such as growing vegetables and cotton, allowed individuals to keep everything exceeding the public quotas. Cotton ginning, cigarette rolling, and transportation also followed the 20/80 profit-sharing ratio. The second reason is that leaders took charge and worked personally, forming a mass movement. When the Border Region Government first entered Handan last year, some comrades developed a taste for personal enjoyment, abandoning the glorious tradition of hard work in the Taihang Mountains, thinking that picking up manure in the city was embarrassing. At this time, Secretary-General Sun and the orderlies went back and forth on the streets picking up manure, and Vice Chairman Rong hoed the ground until ten large blisters formed on his hands. Director Liu worked so hard that his back could not straighten up. When comrades advised them to rest, they refused. Under their influence, a production upsurge arose. After dinner every day, the indoor stadium was quiet and empty, as everyone went to carry bricks, hoe the ground, or pick cotton, creating a competitive fervor. Third, there was unified leadership and decentralized management. All production was under the unified planning and organization of the Production Committee in coordination with the General Affairs Office. The Production Committee was composed of one person selected from each office, department, and院 (yuan). Each office, department, and 院 (yuan) formed its own small group and could independently carry out production, such as planting vegetables at the village head, women comrades spinning thread, cigarette rolling, grinding flour, and cotton ginning, all of which were managed in a decentralized manner. Currently, preparations are underway to launch a larger-scale production campaign. Secretary-General Sun pointed out that this year's policy is to promote industrial and agricultural production, ensure the completion of subsidy fees, and it is expected that this year's production will achieve even greater results.

    边府机关生产主要经验
    首长负责亲自动手
    公私兼顾适当分红
    以工农业为主开展今年大生产
    【本报讯】去年边区政府机关生产成绩卓著一年农工运输商业获利一千二百余万元，补助机关经费九百六十万元，相当全年经费的百分之七十，多数同志每人分红在一万至两万五千元，最多者达四万元。成绩取得的原因，首先是公私兼顾、适当分红。豆腐坊起初三个人每天磨豆子二十斤，还无保证，去秋改为二八分红（现在是三七）每天即可磨四十斤至六十斤豆，豆腐也由每斤豆出斤十四两增到二斤。因豆腐质量好，中央局、公安局、住村群众争相购买，去年一个半月，私人分红四万五千元，交公十余万元。其他个人种菜、种棉，超过交公任务全归个人，轧花、卷烟、运输也都按二八分红。第二个原因是首长亲自动手，形成运动。去年边府初进邯郸，部分同志发展个人享受，丢掉太行山上艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，以为城里拾粪不好意思。这时孙秘书长与勤务员从街上来往拾粪，戎副主席锄地双手磨出十个大泡，刘厅长累得腰都直不起来，同志们劝他们休息遭到了拒绝。由他们的影响，生产热潮高涨起来，每日晚饭后室内球场寂静无人，都去抬砖、锄地，或摘棉花，掀起竞赛热潮。三、统一领导，分散经营，一切生产统归生产委员会协同总务处统一计划与组织，生委会由各厅院处各选一人组成，各厅院处自成一小组。可单独进行生产。如村头种菜，女同志纺线，卷烟、磨面、轧花等都是分散经营。现正准备开展更大规模的生产运动。孙秘书长指出今年方针是提倡工业农业生产，保证完成补助费，预计今年生产，将获更大成绩。
