    Taihang, February 8th (from our newspaper) - In the deep-going mass movement in the Second District of Xiangyuan, attention was paid to solving the ideological problems of village cadres, which improved their work enthusiasm. At a meeting of village cadres in the district on January 29th, it was found that some cadres, seeing individual bad cadres being removed by the masses, were temporarily unable to distinguish the situation and had a "no future" mentality. After the leaders guided everyone to fully express their thoughts, they proposed: "Does being a cadre have a future? Why do these ideas exist? Let's trace the root of the problem." After group discussions, the conclusion was: "Whether there is a future depends on oneself." Immediately, a general meeting was held for discussion. Zhang Shuichun, the village chief of Wuyang Village, said: "We cannot say that all cadres have no future just because individual bad cadres have been struggled against by the masses. For example, Gao Guisheng (the village chief) of Dongwangqiao was clearly a cadre but secretly a special agent. Shouldn't the masses fight against him?" Song Lianjun, the deputy village chief of Guozhuang, said: "My work style was not good in the past, and the masses opposed me, and the higher-ups criticized me. Recently, I have changed, and I have returned the extra fruit I received. The masses and the higher-ups all say I am good." The political director of Guozhuang said: "I also had the fear of delaying work in the past. I have recently figured it out. Work is my own business. In the old society, I got up early and worked late even before I was a cadre, and I never delayed work, but every year I was always underfed and underclothed, and the landlord forced me to not be able to survive the new year. Last year, after a year of turning over, I delayed some work, but now I have enough to eat and wear, and I have a place to live. If I lead the masses in production well this year, my family will be even richer." After he said this, the meeting unanimously said: "Doing a good job has a future." "Not doing everything for the masses and believing in the masses and working together will save a lot of effort."

    襄垣二区村干弄清前途
    改变作风做好工作
    【本报太行八日电】襄垣二区深入群运中，注意解决村干部的思想问题，提高了工作积极性。该区一月二十九日在召开村干部的会上，发现干部因见个别坏干部被群众撤换一时分辨不清，存在着“没前途”思想。领导上在引导大家尽情谈出思想后，便提出：“当干部到底有没有前途？为啥会有这些思想？大家追一下根。”经过小组圪扯，得出结论是：“有没有前途，决定在自己，”随即开大会讨论，五阳村长张水春说：“不能说个别坏干部挨了群众斗争就说干部都没前途，如东王桥高贵生（村长）明是干部，暗是特务，群众不能斗他吗？”郭庄副村长宋连俊说：“我过去作风不好，群众反对，上级批评，最近我转变了，并退出多分的果实，群众和上级都说我好”。郭庄政治主任说：“怕误工思想，我过去也有，最近想通啦，工作就是自己的事，在旧社会，我没当干部起早搭黑，从没误过工，但每年总是个没吃少穿，地主逼的过不了年，去年闹了一年翻身，误了些工，现在可有吃穿，有住的，今年再好好领导群众生产，家就会更富。”他说罢，会场一致说：“做好工作就有前途”。“不包办代替，相信群众和大家一起干，是会省许多工夫的”。
