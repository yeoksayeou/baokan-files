The "Change the World" Ledger
    Shi Hong

    Li Xiyuan was a big landlord, a major tyrant, and a major special agent in the city of Wu'an. He was publicly struggled against four times, his houses and land emptied. His wife and daughters wept bitterly, pleading with the masses to leave them a little something. But Li himself was different. He said to his wife and daughters: "It doesn't matter, we'll leave them with a 'bottom line' (meaning 'the original rent refund ledger for each village'). Once the Nationalists arrive, everything will be ours!" Unexpectedly, the "Nationalists" did not arrive in Wu'an as he wished, and the ledger fell into the hands of the people.

    This ledger is very detailed, with records of why rent was refunded to whom, the names and estimated value of the items refunded, and the names, ages, and positions of the workers, street cadres, and activists... A new militia captain from the old revolutionary base area hadn't been able to find out what he was called after several inquiries, so he was just referred to as "Militia Captain." He regarded the mass struggle as "stealing horses and robbing," so he wrote the rent refund as "coercion" and the rent reversal as "theft." At the end of each document, there was always a slogan, either "Not a penny was given, but things were settled for nothing," or "Remember this situation, do not forget it."

    When this ledger was read aloud at a meeting of city cadres and activists, everyone was so angry their eyes were spitting fire. They all said: "We thought we had struggled against him thoroughly, but who knew he was still unconvinced." Let him confess everything.

    As soon as Li Xiyuan entered the meeting place, the masses began to question him one after another. The first question people wanted him to answer was: "Why did you keep the 'Change the World' ledger?" He quibbled, saying: "It's nothing, just using it to paper the windows, so it wouldn't just be blank paper." The masses said: "You can write anything, but you just had to write about the struggle against you." Some said: "You write your things, but why do you write my name?" Others said: "What does 'settled for nothing, remember this, do not forget it' mean?"... In an instant, dozens of different opinions were raised. He slowly said: "I am old-fashioned, my thinking is incorrect." He was a stutterer, and the more the masses pressed him, the more he stuttered: "I—I am not satisfied with the struggle, I—I want to—" At this time, the masses continued: "You want to do what?" He continued: "I want to—I want to wait for the world to change, and keep a record as a basis."

    Li Xiyuan had more than 90 acres of land and hundreds of rooms. He usually trafficked in drugs and lent money and grain at high interest rates. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, famine victims wailed and the starving were everywhere, but Li bought large tracts of farmland. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the vice president of the Chamber of Commerce. Under his oppression, countless people were displaced and many families were ruined. When people thought about how he became rich by eating human flesh and drinking human blood, they wished they could cut him into a thousand pieces!

    "Let him talk about how he made his fortune," someone shouted from below:

    "I inherited my father's business." He was about to continue when Zhang Baohe immediately smashed him back: "You exploited my blood and sweat." He continued: "You used a large scale for buying and a small scale for selling in the flower room. My mother and my sisters picked three hundred pounds of flowers for you, but you only counted one hundred and eighty. Where did that one hundred and twenty go?"

    He was a major tyrant and a leader of the "Golden Diamond Way" (a special agent organization). He was full of benevolence and morality, but in everything he did, he engaged in male prostitution and female whoring. He was sixty or seventy years old, hugging five wives, and even that wasn't enough. Who knows how many innocent girls he had ruined. In famine years, he went to the Bai family to demand rent. Because the crops in the field hadn't been harvested and the adults at home were hiding, he raped their daughter.

    He was very harsh to his workers. One worker worked for him for three and a half months, but when he calculated the wages, he only counted three full months. The agreed-upon wage was two mao five cents per day, but he only gave him one mao five cents. When the worker asked him why, he said you can eat free food at my house. The worker said he was suffering and couldn't make ends meet, which angered Li Xiyuan, who beat the worker until he was covered in bruises and bleeding everywhere.

    A young man walked angrily in front of him, telling his story in a rhythmic ballad: "I said, master, when I was a long-term worker, my mother had no food to eat, so I borrowed a few kilograms of rice from you. According to the interest rate of the day, I settled the account at the end of the year and even paid you back some money. Because I had no money to pay the interest, it was deducted from next year's wages. Because I had no money, I didn't dare to say no. I worked hard all day long, I couldn't rest even in the middle of the night, I slept in the donkey shed, using half a brick as a pillow, eating bran noodles every day, only eating rice during the New Year. I planted the wheat, but I couldn't eat white flour. The cotton harvest was good, but the worker had no clothes to wear. I was a beast of burden every day, and I was still beaten and scolded. I couldn't bear it anymore, so I settled the account with you. Old Xi, you picked up the account and made up whatever you wanted. I picked up a pair of your old broken shoes, and you counted it as five dou and a half of millet for me. I wore a piece of your torn cloth, and you counted it as a whole shi of millet. Then you compounded the interest, for a total of three shi of millet. At that time, I didn't have three shi of millet, so you took a rope and tied me up. You broke half of the stick, and I hung from the beam for a long time. You stripped off all my clothes and threw me in your backyard. My mother heard about it and lost her temper, she died, my mother suffered really horribly." As he spoke, he cried. After he finished speaking, he said: "Old Xi, tell me, am I lying?" Then, "slap—slap—," he slapped him in the face a few times.

    At this time, the atmosphere in the meeting place was particularly tense. Li Xiyuan had no choice but to hang his head in front of the masses, awaiting the punishment of the people.

　　变天账
    史洪
    李西圆是武安城关一个大地主、大恶霸、大特务，曾经四次大斗，房地一空，老婆闺女痛哭流涕，哀告群众为她多留一点东西，而李个人不然，他对老婆闺女说：“不要紧，咱给他留下个底儿（即‘各村退租底账’），国军一到，啥不是咱的！”不想，“国军”并不能如愿的到达武安，而底账却已落到人民手里。
    这账非常精细，有为什么给谁退的底子，有退出东西的名称和估价，还有工作员、街干部、积极分子………的姓名，年龄和职别。新从老区下来的一个民兵队长，几次都没打听出叫什么，就号了个“民兵队长”。他把群众斗争，认为是“偷马强盗”，所以把退租写成“勒逼”，倒租写作“盗租”。在每张文约的后面，总有一句标语，不是“分文未出，凭白了事”，便是“此种情形，谨记勿忘”。
    当这本账在城关干部、积极分子会上宣读之后，都气得眼里冒着火，一致说：“原以为斗的彻底啦，那知道还不服气”。让他给坦白坦白。
    李西圆刚进入会场，群众便纷纷质问起来。人们要他回答的第一个问题是：“为什么要留变天账”？他狡辩说：“没啥，不过糊窗子显得不是白纸就是”。群众说：“你啥不能写，就偏偏写斗争你的东西”。有的说：“你写你的东西还写上我的名子干啥来”。有的说：“凭白了事，谨记勿忘是个啥意思”？……刹时间，提出几十条不同意见。他慢腾腾的说：“我是老脑筋，我思想不正确”。他是个结巴子，群众愈追，他也就显得愈结巴了：“我——我对斗争不满意，我——我想——”。这时群众接着说：“你想怎么样”接着他说：“我想——我想等变了天，留个底儿作依据”。
    李西圆有九顷多地，房数百间，平日贩卖毒品，大利发放钱粮，民国九年，饥民哀声载道，饿莩遍及全野，而李却大买庄田；抗战前，曾任商务副会长，在他的压榨下，不知道有多少人流离失所，有几多户家破人亡。当人们想到他是吃人肉、喝人血肥起来的时候，就恨不得把他千刀万刮了！
    “让他谈谈他是怎发财的”，下面喊起来：
    “我是子继父业”。他正要往下说的时候，张保合马上把他砸了回去：“你剥削的是我的血汗”。他接着说：“你开花房用大秤收小秤发，我跟俺娘俺姊妹三个人给你掬花三百斤，你只过了一百八，那一百二到那去啦”！
    他是一个大恶霸，是“金钻道”（特务组织）的一个头子，他满口仁义道德，凡事无不男盗女娼，他六七十岁了，抱着五个老婆，就这还不够，不知道又糟塌了多少个纯真姑娘，灾荒年他到白府去要租，因地里籽粒未收，家里大人隐匿不见，他便强奸了人家的姑娘。
    他对工人非常刻薄，有一雇工，给他作了三个半月，算账他却只算三个整月，说好工钱每天两毛五，到时候只给人一毛五，人家问他为什么，他说你能在我家吃白饭，雇工说受苦不开锅，气恼了李西圆，便把这位雇工打得浑身发紫，到处血流。
    有个小伙子气狠狠的走在他的脸前，用快板式的诉说：“我说主人你当长工，我娘没吃饭，借你几斤米，按天上利钱，年底把账算，倒给你找钱，没钱给你利，明年顶工钱，因为没有钱，不敢说不干。不明就往地，半夜不能闲，黑夜睡驴圈，枕的半截砖，每天吃糠面，吃米顶过年，麦子是我种，不能吃白面，棉花收成好，雇工俺没衣穿，每天当牛马，还要打骂俺，实在受不过，给你把账算，老西你拿起账，随便瞎糊算，拾了你一双破旧鞋，小米算俺五斗半。穿了你一件破布衫，算了小米整一石，然后又把利钱滚，一共小米整三石，当时我没三石米，拿起绳子把我拴，棍子你打折了根半，梁上吊了多半天，浑身衣服剥了个光，把我扔到你后院，俺娘听说没了气，气死我娘真苦惨”。他一面说，一面哭，说完后他说：“老西，你说我说的假不假”？说着，“吧——吧——”，就从他脸上打了几巴掌。
    这时，会场空气特别紧张。李西圆只得垂首于群众面前，听候人民的惩处。
