　　Xinhua Bookstore Head Office
    Starts Production Activities
    Comrade Wei Zhen'an Resolutely Participates in Six Hours of Printing
    [This Newspaper Report] According to the Xinhua Bookstore wall newspaper committee report: The head office's production activities have already begun. Comrades generally produce for two hours each day, at least one hour. As of now, in the thrift campaign, all 26 cadres have saved a total of 4,669.5 jin of millet. Some have saved quilts, cotton clothes, single-layer clothing, shoes, and socks, with saving 72 jin of millet for the whole year's allowance being the most common. Comrade Li Shuqin of the Publishing Section, in addition to saving all the items she was supposed to receive for the year (equivalent to 589 jin of millet), also donated 10,000 yuan in savings. When reporting production hours, Comrade Zhou Ziqi wanted to set two hours, but everyone, in consideration of her health, suggested she reduce it to one hour. However, Comrade Zhou proposed: "I can sew single-layer clothing for everyone, and I guarantee the completion of the two-hour task." She has already started production. Comrade Wei Zhen'an of the Receiving and Dispatching Department is over sixty years old this year. Everyone decided to exempt him from production tasks, but he insisted: "If there is a task, I must submit it; if there is no task, I must still submit it. I can guarantee six hours of time each day to participate in printing." His thinking is: Revolution is my home. He saved the allowance, quilt, socks, and two pairs of shoes issued to him. He also wrote "Slow Tempo" on the wall newspaper, saying: "Happy, truly happy! Words are clear, this year is not like previous years, production and thrift must come first. Everyone works hard together, Chiang Kai-shek's civil war cannot be done, our support for the front lines can win, Chiang Kai-shek's troops will be finished."

　　新华书店总店
    开始生产活动
    魏真庵同志坚决参加印刷六小时
    【本报讯】据新华书店墙报委员会报导：总店生产活动已经开始，同志们一般每日生产两个钟头，至少一个钟头。节约运动截至现在为止，全体干部二十六人，共节约小米四千六百六十九斤半，有的节约被子、棉衣、单衣、鞋袜，以节约全年津贴米七十二斤为最普遍。出版科李书芹同志除节约全年应领物品外（合小米五百八十九斤）还捐出存款一万元。在报生产钟点的时候，周之奇同志要定两个钟头，大家为了照顾她的健康，提出她应减成一点钟，但周同志却提出：“我可以给大家缝单衣，两个钟头任务保险完成。”现在已动手生产了。收发处魏真庵同志，他今年六十余岁了，大家决定免除他的生产任务，他却坚持：“有任务要交，没任务也要交，我每天可保证六个钟头的时间参加印刷。”他的思想是：革命就是我的家。他把发给他的津贴、被子、袜子，还有两双鞋都节约了。并在墙报上以“慢板”为题写到：“高兴，真高兴！有话说分明，今年不比往常年，生产节约要当先。大家努力一齐干，蒋介石内战无法办，咱支援前线能打胜，蒋介石队伍得完蛋。”
