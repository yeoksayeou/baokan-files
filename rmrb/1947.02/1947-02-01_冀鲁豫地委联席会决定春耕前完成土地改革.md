　　Joint Conference of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Committee Decides to Complete Land Reform Before Spring Plowing
    Break Through Old Circles and Promote New Creations; Use Administrative Power to Train Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Starting From Their Strengths
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 30th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a joint conference of district committee and civil affairs ministers on the 14th of this month to discuss completing land reform before spring plowing. The meeting lasted four days. Comrade Pan Fusheng of the District Committee first reported on the significance of the meeting, saying: "The task of land reform in our district has not yet been completed. Cadres in old areas think it is 'almost done,' that 'there's nothing left to reform,' while those in border areas think it's impossible. We are bound by a set of solidified old methods from the period of rent reduction and anti-traitor struggles, and have not used new ideas to accept the new spirit of land reform. The purpose of this meeting is to have everyone think of new ways to quickly complete the task of land reform throughout the district before spring plowing." Then, Comrade Shen Yunpu of the Sixth District Committee said: "The best way to overcome the 'almost done' mentality is to use actual materials for education. The mass movement in Zhao Guan Town, Hebei West County, has been going on for several years, but poor peasants have still not received land. If examined from the perspective of land reform, it is a blank village. This kind of ironclad fact will break through the 'almost done' mentality." Comrade Shen Yunpu continued: "Today, Hebei West and Yanggu have recognized the role of using administrative power. They have posted and publicized the decrees for land reform everywhere, so everyone knows about it. They have arrested and educated those who violate the decrees, and the situation has immediately opened up. In the past, it was thought that opening up work required work teams and relied on old village cadres and old activists. The experience of Hebei West and Yanggu proves that activists during the period of rent reduction and anti-traitor struggles are not necessarily activists in land reform. A certain movement must have certain activists. In terms of work methods, Hebei West and Yanggu have put forward new experiences, namely, concentrating a large number of poor peasant activists (in Yanggu, more than 10,000 people were concentrated, not afraid of mixing in a few vagrants and 'lackeys') for short-term training. After enlightening them with land reform ideas and grievances, they were let go to 'ignite fires' everywhere, and the movement immediately started. In short, the old methods have all failed, and the use of new methods has brought vitality to the work." Then, Comrade Wan Li of the Seventh District Committee reported on the work in Wen Shang and Jibei areas. He said: "There, Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents are rampant. As soon as the Farmers' Association was established in the Third District, nine village cadres were beaten to death. In one village, three Farmers' Association chairmen were beaten to death in a row. Here, the government issued land reform proclamations and publicized them everywhere, using administrative power to mobilize poor peasants, hired laborers, and tenants from various villages to receive training, calling on everyone to return to their villages to divide land and grain and work together, which strengthened the courage of the masses. After they returned, they were very enthusiastic and immediately established organizations, fighting and dividing simultaneously, decisively and thoroughly. In this way, more than 80 villages in Jibei, which had not been opened up for years, were opened up in just over ten days." Comrade Wan Li emphasized: "The reason we have achieved results is that we have resolutely abandoned the old ways." Regarding leadership methods, Comrade Wan Li said: "In the past, we only opened one eye to see shortcomings, so we opposed bureaucracy to the point where cadres felt there was no way out for their work. Later, we opened another eye to see advantages and creations, and proposed a merit-making movement, which aroused the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres, and the work immediately became lively." Regarding leadership style, Comrade Wan Li said: "The old method in the past was for leaders to go down and work the same way as those being led; now, leaders should humbly collect grassroots creations everywhere, help elevate them to theoretical principles, and guide the work. This enriches the leadership and improves the grassroots."
    Restoring Areas Launch Campaign to Protect Land and Oppose Counter-Settlement; Old Areas Resolve Outstanding Cases in Land Distribution
    The next day, Comrade Zhang Chengxian of the Second District Committee reviewed that the work in the recovered areas had taken a detour for a while, failing to grasp the masses' demands for revenge and land protection, and the work had cooled down. At that time, the masses demanded revenge, land protection, and opposition to counter-settlement, but some areas wanted to "hold mass rallies to denounce Chiang Kai-shek and air grievances" and "engage in a united front against Chiang Kai-shek," and to restore organizations. The masses demanded "probing the situation," asking everywhere, "Will the Chiang Kai-shek troops come again?" But we rashly and impatiently replied, "They won't come," "Don't know," "What are you asking this for?" We could not answer these questions, so we became detached from the masses. Using the old post-war settlement mentality to do restoration work in the recovered areas was a failure. Therefore, the current work policy in the recovered areas should focus on revenge, land protection, and opposition to counter-settlement, and implement land reform. Cadres should show the masses their determination never to leave again, and to share life and death with the masses.
    The meeting then entered into discussion. In particular, the old circle of work in the old areas was discussed, namely, the so-called starting from resolving outstanding cases and disputes, "from the inside out," which resulted in falling into the quagmire of disputes, sinking deeper and deeper. Everyone agreed that we should start with resolutely implementing land reform and filling in the gaps, and solve outstanding cases by finding methods such as working from the inside out during land distribution, otherwise the situation in the old areas would still not be opened up. Comrade Pan Fusheng made a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He called on everyone to put down old circles and old ideas, absorb new experiences, and create new methods in the future implementation of land reform. He pointed out in terms of policy: We must take care of the interests of the middle peasants, implement moving the two ends while keeping the middle untouched, and resolutely give land to the peasants. In order to win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, land reform must be completed before spring plowing in all areas and under all circumstances (except for guerrilla areas). In terms of leadership methods, he called for resolutely opposing the simplistic "one-on-one" mentality, and that land reform must be combined with war, and guerrilla warfare must be combined with land reform; only by holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other can we create mass guerrilla warfare. Comrade Pan Fusheng finally called for advocating a learning atmosphere, and that every comrade should humbly learn from the masses, carefully study the instructions and documents from higher authorities, carefully study the newspapers, and widely exchange their own and the masses' new creations through the newspapers.

　　冀鲁豫地委联席会决定春耕前完成土地改革
    冲破旧圈子发扬新创造  运用行政力量训练贫雇从优点出发
    【本报冀鲁豫卅日电】中共冀鲁豫区党委于本月十四日，召开地委民运部长联席会，讨论于春耕前完成土地改革问题，会议共历时四天。首由区党委潘复生同志报告开会意义称：“本区土地改革任务还没完成，老区干部认为已‘差不多’，‘没啥可革’，边缘区以为没法办。我们被一套凝固的减租反奸时期的老办法束缚着，没用新的思想接受土地改革的新精神。这次会议就是要大家来想新的办法，迅速将土地改革任务于春耕前在全区范围内求得完成。”接着，六地委申云浦同志发言称：“克服‘差不多’思想的最好办法的是用实际材料进行教育。河西县赵官镇的群众运动，搞了几年，但贫农仍未得到土地。若从土地改革观点检查，是一个空白村。用这种铁的事实就打通‘差不多’的思想了。”申云浦同志继称：今天河西、阳谷认识了运用行政力量的作用，将实行土地改革的法令到处张贴宣传，因之尽人皆知。将破坏法令分子逮捕，进行教育，局面马上打开。过去认为搞开工作局面，非用工作队不行，非经老村干、老积极分子不可，河西和阳谷的经验证明，在减租、反奸时期的积极分子，不一定是土地改革的积极分子，一定的运动要有一定的积极分子。在工作方法上，河西、阳谷提出了新的经验，即集中大量贫农积极分子（在阳谷集中了一万多人，不怕混入少数游民、“狗腿”）进行短期训练，以土地改革思想启发与诉苦后，放手将他们撒出去，到处“点火”，运动就马上搞起来了。总之，老一套的都失败了，采用新办法工作就有生气。”接着七地委万里同志汇报汶上、济北地区的工作，他说：“那里蒋匪蒋特横行，三区一成立农会即被打死九个村干，有一个村接连被打死三个农会长。在这里，政府就出土地改革布告，到处宣传，用行政力量调各村贫农雇工佃户受训，号召大家回村分地分粮一齐干，壮了群众的胆。他们回去后，积极性很高，立即建立组织，随斗随分，干脆彻底。这样在十几天内就打开了年来没有打开的济北八十多个庄子。”万里同志强调说：“我们所以有成绩，是由于坚决抛弃了老一套。”关于领导方法，万里同志说：“我们过去只睁开了一只看缺点的眼，所以反官僚主义，反得干部感觉工作没出路；后来我们睁开了另一只看优点看创造的眼，提出立功运动，唤起了干部的积极性与创造性，工作马上显得生气勃勃。”关于领导作风，万里同志说：“过去的老办法是领导者插下去和被领导者一样地工作；现在领导者应该虚心地到处去收集下层创造，帮助提高到理论原则上来，指导工作。这就丰富了领导，提高了下层。”
    恢复区开展保田反倒算  老区在分地中解决悬案
    第二天，二地委张承先同志检讨了收复区工作走了一段弯路，没有抓紧群众复仇保田要求，工作曾冷下去了。当时群众要求复仇保田、反倒算，有的地区却要“开群众反蒋诉苦大会”，“搞反蒋统一战线”，搞恢复组织。群众要求“摸底”，到处问“蒋军会再来吗”？我们却轻率地不耐烦地回答：“不来了”，“不知道”，“问这干啥”！我们不能答复这些问题，就脱离了群众，用老的善后观点去作恢复区工作是失败了。所以目前收复区工作方针，应以复仇保田、反倒算为中心，贯彻土地改革。干部应向群众表明绝不再走，和群众同生死共患难的决心。
    会议至此，进入讨论。特别讨论了老区工作的老圈子，即所谓先从解决悬案纠纷入手，“由内向外”，结果使自己掉入纠纷的泥坑，越陷越深。大家一致认为应从坚决贯彻土地改革、填平补齐入手，在分地中由里向外找等方法解决悬案，否则老区局面仍打不开的。会议最后由潘复生同志作总结，他号召大家在今后贯彻土地改革中，放下旧圈子、旧思想，吸收新经验，创造新办法。在政策上指出：要照顾中农利益，实行中间不动两头动，坚决给农民以土地。为了争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，在任何地区任何情况下（除游击区外），一律在春耕前，完成土地改革。在领导方法上，号召坚决反对简单化的“单打一”思想，土地改革必须与战争结合，游击战争必须与土地改革结合；一手拿枪，一手分田，才能造成群众性的游击战争。潘复生同志最后号召，提倡学习空气，每个同志应虚心向群众学习，好好学习上级的指示与文件，好好学习报纸，并将自己和群众的新的创造，通过报纸，广泛的互相交流。
