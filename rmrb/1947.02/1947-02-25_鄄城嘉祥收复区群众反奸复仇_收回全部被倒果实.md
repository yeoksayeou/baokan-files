　　The masses in Recovered Areas of Juancheng and Jiaxiang Fight Back Against Traitors and Avenge Their Grievances
    Recovering All Fruits Seized Through Reversal of Verdicts
    [From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 21st] On the 5th of this month, Juancheng held a county-wide anti-traitor rally to avenge the martyred Farmers' Association Chairman, Comrade Li Kunshan. The chief culprits in the murder, Zhang Xiaoduan and Zhang Xinqian, were executed by firing squad, and the fruits of the "reversal of verdicts" by landlords were recovered. Comrade Li Kunshan had been actively leading the masses in their liberation and had united more than 30 people to form a Farmers' Association, leading the peasants' struggle against the two Zhangs. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Juancheng, Li Kunshan was lying ill in Mao Village. Zhang Xinqian then appointed himself the puppet village chief, destroyed all the furniture in Li Kunshan's home, and looted everything. He then reported to the enemy, who went to arrest Li Kunshan. Kunshan was unable to escape due to his illness, and in order not to lose his integrity, he hanged himself. The two Zhangs even forbade others to bury him and reported Li's wife to the enemy for arrest. At the same time, they threatened the Farmers' Association members to hand over all the fruits of the struggle, offer wine and kowtow in apology, and be forced to sign an agreement never to struggle again, guaranteeing the safety of the two Zhangs. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops were driven back, the two Zhangs and the landlords who had "reversed the verdicts" were all arrested, and a public trial was held to try the chief culprits in the murder. At the request of the masses, the two Zhangs were executed on the spot. The landlords who had "reversed the verdicts" were doubly punished, and the masses recovered all the fruits that had been seized.
    [Another dispatch] Jiaxiang launched a campaign to fight back against traitors and avenge grievances, with the masses demanding the return of the fruits seized through "reversal of verdicts." After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Jiaxiang, the "Returning Home Corps" of local despotic landlords, relying on the power of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, arbitrarily oppressed and cruelly harmed the liberated peasants, implementing the vicious method of demanding five or eight dou of grain for every three dou when "reversing verdicts." After our army recovered Jiaxiang, more than 800 people held an anti-traitor and revenge rally in Nanwu Mountain. At the meeting, the county magistrate held the less-than-one-year-old child of martyr Liu Jixiang, talking about the circumstances of his family's persecution, even this child was almost killed. The entire audience wept when he talked about this. Finally, the meeting decided to execute four murderers to avenge the dead. At the meeting on January 13, the democratic government agreed to the demands of the masses and executed the scoundrels Lei Yumei, Gao Xuechang, and Pan Shouren, who had brutally murdered the chairman of the Farmers' Association and seized the fruits of the peasants' struggle by "reversing verdicts."
    [From our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 22nd] After the anti-"reversal of verdicts" and revenge campaign in Juancheng, the masses continued to carry out land reform. The masses in Maozai Village in the Fifth District struggled against the local tyrant landlord Xiao Erhei, recovering 28 mu of land, one ox, one house site, one house, large trees, grain, etc. In Bazhuang Village in the Tenth District, the local tyrant Ba Changrong scolded the masses after the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived in Juancheng and dragged away the chairman of the Farmers' Association's ox. At the beginning of January, the government arrested him, made him admit his mistakes to the masses, and distributed all the recovered fruits to the masses. Li Muying of Wali Village appointed himself a puppet office worker after the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the city, and the masses' land and grain were all looted, and the land of the honor veterans was also seized for cultivation. After our army recovered the city, the district cadres immediately led the masses to struggle against him, recovering the fruits of their blood and sweat.
