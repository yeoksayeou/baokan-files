Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Nanjing, 18th: Since Chiang Kai-shek issued the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" on the 16th, newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai, both among the public and semi-official, believe that this move cannot save the crisis. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily commented: This plan has placed the entire national people's economic life under control. Its purpose is for the civil war, but if the civil war does not stop, no matter what emergency measures you take, it will not save the crisis. Gold and US dollars will go into the underground market. Price controls, based on the experience of the eight years of the War of Resistance, are impossible, but the income of public school teachers and wage laborers is being controlled, and it is even more difficult for the people to survive. The Nanjing Xinmin Daily stated: The reason why finance and economy have reached today's point is entirely because of the civil war. It makes the financial deficit like an astronomical figure, and any income is instantly consumed by the civil war.

The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao also stated that the current shock originated from the continuous decline in the value of the "legal tender." If the civil war does not stop, the amount of "legal tender" issued cannot be reduced, then any method is in vain. It also stated that regarding the three points of prohibiting gold trading, abolishing the February 6th order (i.e., increasing import taxes by 50% and export subsidies by 100%) and adjusting foreign exchange rates, we see the government's frantic hand and the authorities' undisguisable failure. Prohibiting gold trading is equivalent to saying that the central bank has no gold, and it has lost a tool to absorb inflation. In the future, currency will inflate even more, which is a failure; the February 6th order, which disguisedly adjusted exchange rates for gold and banknotes, caused prices of everything to rise sharply, and the United States also protested, getting slapped on both sides, so the order was changed in the morning and evening, which is the second failure; the exchange rate was adjusted to 12,000, which is simply surrendering to the black market, which is the third failure. The newspaper stated that increasing taxes is easier said than done. The sale of "state-owned" enterprises must prevent the encroachment of monopoly capital. The difficulty of price controls in achieving results can be imagined. As for freely declaring foreign exchange, it is feared that most of it is monopoly capital, or no one will execute it, or they will execute it and report back that there is no evidence, then it will fail. But what is said above are all technical issues. The fundamental issue is still stopping the war. Ta Kung Pao described the current situation as "a second wave is brewing."

Even the "CC" faction's Nanjing Dagang Daily pointed out that this plan may have some temporary effect, but one should not have too much hope for solving the problems of national industry and commerce, etc. Moreover, the deficit caused by the civil war will still be impossible to make up for. Tax revenue cannot increase income when corruption is rampant everywhere, and the entire decree will also be corrupted. The Chinese (referring to the Chiang-controlled area) style has always been that those who steal gold are thieves, and those who steal the country are lords. It is hopeless for law enforcers to find ways [to circumvent the law].

　　蒋区经济危机无法挽救
    京沪各报抨击蒋“紧急措施方案”ＣＣ派报纸亦悲鸣认为无济于事
    【新华社延安二十四日电】南京十八日讯：十六日蒋介石发表“经济紧急措施方案”后，京沪民间的甚至半官方的报纸均认此举无法挽救危机。沪文汇报评称：这方案已将整个国家人民经济生活置于统制下，其目的是为了内战，但内战不停任你采的什么紧急措施都无法挽救危急。黄金与美钞将转入地下市场，物价管制根据抗战八年的经验是不可能的，可是公教人员与工资劳动者的收入是被统制了，人民更难活命了。南京新民报称：财政经济弄到今天的地步，全是因为内战，它使财政赤字有如天文数字、稍有收入转瞬即耗于内战。
    上海大公报亦称此次震撼，起于“法”币价值的不断低落，内战不息，“法”币发行额无法收缩，则任何办法都是徒然。并称就禁止黄金买卖、废止二月六日命令（按即进口加税百分之五十及出口贴补百分之百）与调整外汇三点，看见政府的手忙足乱及当局的无可掩饰的失败。禁止黄金买卖等于说中央银行已没有黄金，少了一件吸收通货膨胀的工具，今后通货将更膨胀，是一失败；二月六日命令，变相调整汇率金钞，百物大涨特涨，美国也抗议，两面挨耳光，于是朝令夕改，是二失败；汇率调整为一万二，简直是向黑市投降，是三失败。该报称增税是易说难做的，“国”营事业售卖要预防独占资本侵占，物价管制之难收效可以想像。至自由申报外汇，则只怕多是独占资本或竟无人执行，或执行而以查无实据回报，那就落空了。但以上所云云还都是技术问题，根本问题还在停战，大公报描写现在的情形为“第二次的风潮正在酝酿中”。
    甚至“ＣＣ”派的南京大刚报亦指出这方案可能暂时发生一点效果，但对解决民族工商业问题等等则不能存过分希望。且内战造成的赤字仍将无法弥补，税收在贪污满天下时也不能增加收入，整个的法令亦将变质，中国（按指蒋管区）从来的作风就是窃金者贼窃国者侯，执法者设法是无可救的。
