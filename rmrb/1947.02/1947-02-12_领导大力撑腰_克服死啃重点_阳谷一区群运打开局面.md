(This report from the Ji-Lu-Yu [冀鲁豫] area was transmitted on the 9th by this newspaper) In the past half-month, the mass movement in the first district of Yanggu has broken new ground. Fifty-three villages (out of a total of 108 villages in the district) have begun to reclaim land. The breakthrough is mainly due to the strong support given to the masses by the leadership. They separately convened a mass mobilization rally of ten thousand people and an activists' meeting of over a thousand people to find the roots of poverty and pour out grievances. They also organized a joint struggle rally of over five thousand people to counter traitors, settle accounts, and pour out grievances. This gave the masses the confidence to turn themselves around and dare to take action. Secondly, they worked together, overcoming the tendency to focus solely on "key areas." As a result, even Xihu Village, which had never been mobilized before, began to move.

    阳谷一区群运打开局面
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】阳谷一区群运在过去半月来，已轰开了局面，有五十三个村（全区共一零八村）进行收回土地。轰开的原因，主要是领导上大力的给群众撑腰，分别召开万人宣传动员大会及千人以上的积极分子大会，进行找穷根倒苦水，又组织了一个五千人以上的联合斗争大会，反奸清算倒苦水。这样使群众有了翻身的信心，敢起来干。其次是一齐搞，克服死啃“重点”的偏向。因此从来没有动的西湖村也动起来了。
