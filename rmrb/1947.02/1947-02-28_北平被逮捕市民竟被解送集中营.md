　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th】 United Press Beiping, 24th: Relatives of the more than two thousand citizens of this city, who were illegally arrested by the Jiang government last week, have been unable to find their whereabouts in the city's prisons. Sources say that the arrested have been sent to special concentration camps. According to family members of those arrested, the arrests were carried out in the middle of the night. The arrested were taken from their beds without even being allowed to put on proper clothing, and women were not spared. In one case, when a couple was arrested, they were forced to leave behind a four-month-old infant and a two-year-old child. The infant was still asleep. Among those arrested are many well-known lawyers and doctors. It is estimated that the number of those arrested has exceeded two thousand four hundred.

　　北平被逮捕市民竟被解送集中营
    【新华社延安二十六日电】美联社北平二十四日消息：上周横遭蒋政府非法逮捕之二千余市民的亲属，在本市各监狱中均未发现他们的踪迹，各方面消息均谓被捕者已被解送特种集中营。据被捕者家属声称，逮捕系于深夜进行，被捕者于床上起身时竟不令穿好衣服即行抓走，妇女亦不能幸免。某夫妇被捕时并强迫留下一出生仅四月之婴孩及二岁之小孩，其婴儿尚在睡中。被捕者当中包括许多著名的律师和医生，据估计被捕人数已逾二千四百人。
