Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th. Before the Lunar New Year, the Chiang government took advantage of rising gold prices to massively sell gold, creating a huge gold rush that strangled central industry and commerce. According to various sources, the price of gold in Shanghai reached its peak on February 13th before the New Year, at 398,000 yuan per tael. The Central Bank sold more than 200,000 taels of gold in a few days, absorbing more than 100 billion legal tender. Some people call this "gold policy" a "gold disaster," and its style is no different from that of speculators. When selling gold and absorbing legal tender in December, the Shanghai market's money supply suddenly tightened, and the black market interest rate soared from 14-15% to 24-25% or even 30%. This was tantamount to adding insult to injury for industrialists and businessmen in need of working capital. As a result, Tianbaofeng Silver Shop, Dacheng Silver House, and Jianguo Bank, among others, went bankrupt and were publicly reported. Countless others collapsed silently or were teetering on the brink. The Economic Weekly pointed out that the Central Bank was not selling gold to stabilize gold prices, because it did not sell gold at the beginning of the price fluctuations, but only began to sell when the price approached 400,000 yuan. The truth is that the gold sold by the bank was bought from the United States. The cost per bar, including the purchase price, was only about 1.2 to 1.3 million, but it was sold at a price of more than 3 million, more than double the original price. Therefore, this "selling at a good price" policy is a "means for bureaucratic capital to make a fortune," which only further exacerbates "the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer."

　　蒋记中央银行
    大量抛售黄金
    造成投机风潮，物价高涨、工商业倒闭。
    【新华社延安廿八日电】旧历年关前蒋政府乘金价上涨之际，大量抛售黄金，曾造成扼杀中心工商业的巨大黄金风潮。据各方消息，年关前上海黄金二月十三日为最高峰，计每两卅九万八千元。中央银行数日中抛出黄金廿余万两，吸取法币一千亿以上。此种“黄金政策”有人名之为“黄金灾”其作风与投机家无异。在十二月抛售黄金，吸取法币时，沪市银根骤紧，暗息由一角四、五突升至二角四、五乃至三角。对需要资金周转之工商业者，无异雪上加霜。因此倒闭而公开见诸报端的，即有天保丰银楼，大成银号，建国银行等。至无声倒下与动摇中者，不知凡几。经济周报指出，中央银行并非为平抑金价而抛售黄金，因为它并没有在金价开始波动之初即抛售黄金，而在金价迫近四十万大关时始行抛出。真相是该行抛售的黄金，系买自美国，每条成本连买价等，总共不过一百二三十万，以三百多万的价格抛出“砖头”，超出原价两倍，故这种“善价而沽”的政策，乃是“官僚资本发财的手段”，只是更加加重“官肥民瘦”。
