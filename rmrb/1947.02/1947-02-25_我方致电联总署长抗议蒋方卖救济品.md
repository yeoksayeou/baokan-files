　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 23rd: A United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd reported that Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, sent a telegram to General Rooks, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Washington, protesting the Chiang Kai-shek government's demand to "sell grain and cotton on the open market." Dong stated: If UNRRA agrees to this request, it means that the suffering Chinese people in war-torn areas can no longer expect to receive relief. In a letter to the Director of the UNRRA China Office, Dong stated: If UNRRA supplies are to be sold on the open market, it would be better to transport all relief supplies to the Liberated Areas, because in the Liberated Areas, relief supplies are truly used for relief.

　　我方致电联总署长抗议蒋方卖救济品
    【新华社延安二十三日电】合众社南京二十二日电，中国解放区救济总会主席董必武致电华盛顿联总署长鲁克斯将军，抗议蒋介石政府要求“公开市场上出卖谷物和棉花”。董氏称：假如联线应允此一要求，那就是说在遭受战争蹂躏地方，受苦受难的中国人民再不能期望得到救济。董氏于致联总中国办事处处长函中称：假如联总物资将在公开市场上出卖的话，那不如把所有救济物资都运到解放区来，因为在解放区救济物资是真正用在救济上的。
