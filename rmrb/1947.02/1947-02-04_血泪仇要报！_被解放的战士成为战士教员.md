　　Blood and Tears of Hatred Must Be Avenged!
    Liberated Soldiers Become Instructor-Soldiers
    [Our Special Dispatch] (1) Comrade Yu Xinke of the Second Company of a certain unit on the JiluYu Front is a newly liberated comrade. He compiled a lesson entitled "Blood and Tears of Hatred Must Be Avenged!" about his experience of being captured into the Chiang army. He is now a political instructor in the unit, taking turns giving lessons to various regiments and battalions. When he gave a lesson to the directly subordinate units of the department, his speech moved the entire audience. Newly liberated comrades said: "It's really like this. After the Kuomintang grabs soldiers, who doesn't end up with a broken family!" Old comrades said: "We can't let the Chiang army repeat this in our liberated areas." (2) Comrade Yu Rufa, a machine gunner in a certain detachment, came from the Vietnamese battlefield. He was a heavy machine gun shooter in the Chiang army. His technique is very skilled. After the Battle of Hua County, the entire company elected him as a shooter instructor. He said, "As long as I know it, I guarantee I'll teach everyone!" When he was coaching, he explained the names of each part of the machine gun, the theory of shooting, and practical application, and explained it very well. Whenever the company has time, the soldiers surround him to study.
