    Personally Guides Military Training
    Li Xiaoshan Sets a 59-Meter Grenade Throwing Record
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] Vice Commander Sun of the Taiyue Military Region personally guided military training in a certain unit. Vice Commander Sun gathered comrades from a certain battalion who could throw grenades over 40 meters to explain the essentials of grenade throwing and advocate the correct throwing posture. He said, "The grenade must be held tightly, utilizing a back-and-forth reciprocating motion; the whole body should move, and you must resolutely use the correct throwing posture, not a swing throw. Swing throwing is a way to avoid arm pain, but grenade throwing must go through the arm pain stage. Only by practicing from pain to no pain can you become a good grenade thrower. Swing throws have deviations and are not easy to hit the target. The correct throw can throw both far and accurately." He further emphasized combining hard practice with finding the essentials, but hard practice must be the main focus, finding the essentials in hard practice, which aroused enthusiastic research in the unit. Comrade Li Xiaoshan, deputy platoon leader of the third platoon of a certain company, set the highest record of 59 meters with a correct throw in hard practice, and won the title of "Grenade Throwing Hero".

    李小山创五九公尺投弹纪录
    【本报太岳十四日电】太岳军区孙副司令员亲自指导某部练兵。孙副司令员到某营召集投弹四十公尺以上的同志讲解投弹要领，倡导正投姿势。他说：“弹要十分握紧，起着往来复线的作用；要全身运动，坚决用正投姿态，不要抡投。抡投是避免臂痛的办法，但投弹必须经过臂痛阶段。由疼练到不疼才能成为好的投弹手。抡投有偏差，不易命中。正投既能投远又能命中。”他更强调要把苦练和寻找要领结合起来，但必须以苦练为主，在苦练中寻找要领，引起该部热烈研究。某连三排副李小山同志在苦练中创正投五十九公尺最高纪录，荣获“投弹英雄”称号。
