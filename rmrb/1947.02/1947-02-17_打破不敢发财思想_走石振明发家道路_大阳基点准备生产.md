　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th] On February 7th, the Dada Yang base point village convened a meeting of village cadres from Li Jiazhuang, Zhao Zhuang and other five villages to discuss production preparations after liberation. It was discovered that some people were afraid to get rich, because some middle peasants' interests were harmed during the land reform, which affected the production enthusiasm of middle and poor peasants. For example, some were willing to remain poor peasants, taking pride in being poor. In order to remove these ideological obstacles in production, the meeting decided: 1. Use the method of expressing thoughts to see what ideological concerns the masses have, and provide specific education. 2. Vigorously promote Shi Zhenming's path, calling for getting rich and building a family, and learn from Shi Zhenming. Inspire landlords to learn from Zhang Yongtai and participate in labor production. 3. From now on, whoever works will own the fruits of their labor, and whoever can get rich will enjoy the benefits. It also called on cadres and activists who actively led the liberation in the land reform to actively lead production, personally participate in labor, and become models of labor production, getting rich, and building a family.

　　打破不敢发财思想
    走石振明发家道路
    大阳基点准备生产
    【本报太岳十四日电】二月七日，东大阳基点村召开李家庄、赵庄等五村村干会议，讨论翻身后的生产准备工作。发现有些群众不敢发财，原因是由于土地改革中伤害了些中农利益，影响了中农贫农生产情绪，如有的愿意还当贫农，以贫为荣。为解除这些生产中的思想障碍，会议讨论决定：一、用表心思的办法，看看群众有些什么思想顾虑，作具体教育。二、好好宣传石振明的道路，号召发财致富和兴家立业，向石振明看齐。对地主启发他们学习张永泰，参加到劳动生产中去。三、今后谁劳动下的是谁的，谁能发财谁享福；并号召在土地改革中积极领导翻身的干部和积极分子，要积极领导生产，亲自参加劳动，成为劳动生产发财致富的模范。
