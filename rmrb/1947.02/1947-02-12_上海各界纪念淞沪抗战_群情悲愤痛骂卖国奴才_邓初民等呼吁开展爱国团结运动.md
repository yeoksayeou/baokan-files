Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th (Delayed) Dispatch from Shanghai: On January 28th, approximately 3,000 people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a memorial meeting for the 15th anniversary of the "January 28th" Incident (淞沪抗战). Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Chen Mingshu, Shen Junru, Deng Chumin, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, Luo Longji, and others formed the presidium. After Li Jishen delivered the opening remarks, General Chen Mingshu, a leader of the 19th Route Army, gave a speech. When he said, "The 19th Route Army is dead, but this seed remains in the world," tears welled up in his eyes! Deng Chumin said: "Today, the Chinese people spontaneously commemorate the anniversary of the army and people's spontaneous resistance. The Chinese people understand how to resist Japanese imperialism, and they also understand how to resist any imperialism! (Loud applause) The Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan has finally been victorious, and if we are to resist any imperialism, we will surely be victorious! (Applause) Unfortunately, after the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism, the lackeys invited American imperialism! Japanese soldiers were in China for nine years, and they never dared to rape Chinese female students in the ancient cultural city, but American soldiers dared to do so!" The whole audience roared, "We want revenge!" "Being a lackey is the same whether they are pro-Japanese or pro-American! (Loud applause) Because lackeys always have their big country master, and they have no China, no Chinese people! (Loud applause) Today, as we commemorate 'January 28th,' we must combine the commemoration of resisting Japanese imperialist lackeys with the struggle against American imperialist lackeys! (Loud applause, lasting for a long time) We must combine the struggle for national independence with the struggle for democracy and freedom! (Loud applause) As we commemorate 'January 28th,' we must establish a patriotic, democratic, and united front to fight together to win the final victory!" Guo Moruo said, "The 19th Route Army was eliminated because they were 'good at fighting external wars but inept at internal wars!' The 'heroes' who are good at internal wars are now high-ranking officials! But it must be understood that the people's armed forces are very powerful now." The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM and adopted a letter to the people of the country, calling for the launch of a patriotic solidarity movement that is different from the situation in the "January 28th" era but with the same spirit, to consolidate and expand the national democratic united front. It demanded that the United States rapidly change its China policy and Far East policy, withdraw all American military and political organizations stationed in China, and abandon all kinds of privileges and unfriendly practices towards China. It demanded that the government implement the four promises and stop policies that disturb and harm the people, such as conscription, trade requisition, grain requisition, and increased taxes.

    【新华社延安四日电】（迟到）沪讯：上月二十八日，上海各界约三千人举行“一、二八”十五周年纪念大会。李济琛、黄炎培、陈铭枢、沈钧儒、邓初民、马叙伦、马寅初、罗隆基等为主席团。李济琛致开会词后，十九路军领袖陈铭枢将军演说，在他说到“十九路军是死了，但这颗种子还留在人间”时，热泪不禁夺眶而出！邓初民说：“今天中国人民自动纪念军民自动抗日的纪念日。中国人民懂得反抗日本帝国主义，也懂得反抗任何帝国主义！（大鼓掌）中国人民的反日战争终于胜利，如果要反抗任何帝国主义也一定会胜利！（鼓掌）可惜的中国人民在战胜日本帝国主义之后，奴才们又请来个美国帝国主义！日本兵在中国共九年。都没有敢在文化古城强奸中国的女学生，而美兵却敢于这样做了”！全场怒吼：“我们要报仇”！“当奴才的不分亲日亲美总是一样！（大鼓掌）因为奴才们总是有了他的大国主人，就没有中国，就没有中国人民！（大鼓掌）我们今天纪念‘一、二八’，一定要把反抗日帝奴才的纪念和反抗美帝奴才的斗争结合起来！（大鼓掌，经久不息）要把争民族独立的斗争和争民主自由的斗争结合起来！（大鼓掌）我们纪念‘一、二八’，必须建立爱国民主统一战线，共同奋斗，以争取最后胜利！”郭沫若说：“十九路军被消灭了，因为他们是‘外战内行，内战外行’！内战内行的‘英雄’，他们现在是一品当朝！但是要知道人民的武力非常强大了”。大会于下午一时散会，并通过发表告国人书，呼吁展开与“一、二八”时代形势不同而精神无异的爱国团结运动。以便巩固和扩大民族民主联合阵线。要求美国迅速改变对华政策与远东政策，撤退全部驻华美军的军政机构，放弃对华各种特权与不友好的作风。要求政府，实行四项诺言，停止征兵、征贸、征粮、加税等扰民病民的政策。
