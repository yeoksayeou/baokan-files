　　[Jinan Dispatch, February 16th] Zhaoqiao has uncovered an omitted landlord, Guo Cunyi, and the masses are now thoroughly settling accounts with him. Guo Cunyi relied on his brother being a medical officer in Yan Xishan's army to act tyrannically in the village, engaging in usury. His current hired worker, Zhang Liu (his cousin), was once elected as the director of the district trade union. Last April, Guo Cunyi, hearing that the peasants were going to struggle against him, discussed with Zhang Liu and prepared wine and dishes, inviting several trusted workers of Zhang Liu to plot a fake struggle. Zhang Liu pretended to be sick at home, falsely claiming that the employer wouldn't pay for medical expenses, and struggled against Guo Cunyi once, even parading him through the streets. At the time, Guo Cunyi pretended not to admit his mistakes, and asked a mediator to persuade him, before putting on an act and bowing his head. As a result, he was fined 70,000 yuan. Guo Cunyi falsely sold 30 mu of good land, a house, and livestock with a cart to the trade union. Zhang Liu even falsely bought that cart. Honest workers and the entire village believed that he had truly been struggled against. Last autumn, the accounts were unclear after the harvest, and honest workers were dissatisfied but dared not mention it openly. Some workers wanted to sell the land, and backward worker Guo Er said, "Do we workers have the right to sell it? If you sell it, you'll be famous, and the Central Army will come and chop off your heads." After the rent reduction movement began this time, Zhang Liu arbitrarily classified Guo Cunyi as a middle peasant to avoid mass struggle. The peasants of Zhaoqiao were suppressed by backward elements in the trade union, and their morale was low. Later, after district cadres deeply understood the situation and boldly supported the peasants, the peasants began to move. The county trade union learned that there were several backward elements among the workers in this village, and then conducted class education. Some deceived workers woke up and exposed the truth of Guo Cunyi's bribery plot, arousing the anger of the entire village's peasants, and a thorough accounting is now underway.

　　赵桥深入清查斗倒遗漏地主
    【本报冀南十六日电】赵桥清查出遗漏地主国存义，群众正对他进行彻底清算。国存义仗他哥在阎锡山部当医官，在村横行霸道，放高利贷，现雇佣工张六（他的表弟）曾被选为区工会主任，去年四月，国存义听到农民将要斗他，便和张六商量，预备酒菜，请来张六几个亲信工人谋造假斗争，张六在家装病，假说雇主不给药费，把国存义斗了一回，还游了街，当时国存义假装不认错，托出说事人劝说，才装模作样低了头，结果罚他七万元，国存义假卖给工会好地三十亩、宅一处、大车牲口等东西，张六还假买了那辆大车，老实的工人及全村群众都以为真斗了他。去秋地里打下粮食，账目不清，老实工人不满，当面也不敢提，有的工人愿意把地卖掉，落后工人国二小说：“咱工人有权卖么？你们卖你们出名，中央军过来砍你们的头。”这次查减运动开始后，张六擅自划国存义为中农成份，避免群众斗争。赵桥农民受工会落后分子镇压，情绪消沉，后经区干深入了解情况，大胆与农民撑腰，农民才动起来。县工会了解了这村工人中有几个落后分子，遂作了阶级教育，有些被骗工人觉悟了，揭发国存义收买阴谋的真相，激起了全村农民的怒火，现正进行彻底清算。
