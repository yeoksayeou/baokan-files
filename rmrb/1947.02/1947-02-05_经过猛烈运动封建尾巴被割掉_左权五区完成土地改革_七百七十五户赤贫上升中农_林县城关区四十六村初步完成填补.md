　　After Vigorous Movement, Feudal Tails Were Cut Off
    Land Reform Completed in the Fifth District of Zuoquan
    775 Impoverished Households Rose to Middle Peasant Status
    Preliminary Completion of Land Redistribution in 46 Villages in the Chengguan District of Lin County
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan dispatch] The land reform in the Fifth District of Zuoquan has been successfully completed. This time, the scale of the movement to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller" was more vigorous and in-depth than the rent reduction in 1942 and the anti-traitor movement in 1943. In a very short period, all more than ten thousand people in the district's twenty-one villages and seventy-five natural villages were involved in the movement. A total of 109 feudal tails were cut off, and 219 internal disputes among peasants were mediated. After resolving internal problems, new and old cadres and activists in each village united to launch a fierce struggle against the feudal landlords. Through a widespread movement of speaking out about suffering and digging up roots, the ideological awareness of the peasants has been greatly enhanced. The feudal rulers' ideas of conscience and fate, which they used to control the peasants' suffering, have gradually lost their effect among the liberated masses. After the broad masses of peasants tore off the remnants of affection and conscience towards the landlords, the cunning landlords' hidden feudal tails were exposed. The Fifth District not only mobilized villages to expose and report on each other, but also reported the hidden materials of landlords in other districts to the village government for return to their original villages. Statistics for the entire district show that 6,119.5 mu of land, 2,976 rooms, 330 head of livestock, 2,020 sheep, 9,539 pieces of furniture, 4,080 pieces of clothing, and 14,738 yuan in silver dollars, as well as many ingots and copperware, were cleared out. A total of 2,876 poor peasants in the district were awarded the fruits of the struggle, and 775 impoverished households rose to the level of middle peasants. In order to help their impoverished peasant brothers and sisters to become liberated, the liberated peasants donated land and property. Yangjiao assisted the poor village of Shitan Yao with 30 mu of land and more than 50,000 yuan. Xindian donated 200,000 yuan to Houzhuang. In addition to helping Dong Huangzhang and Xishan two-bian villages to become liberated, Xi Huangzhang also assisted Shang Jiaozhang in the Seventh District with 11 mu of good water land, earnestly realizing comprehensive filling and leveling.

    [This newspaper, Taihang, 2nd dispatch] The Chengguan District of Lin County inspected the land redistribution movement throughout the district on the 21st of last month. The land redistribution in the district began in mid-December of last year. As of January 19, 46 of the district's 72 administrative villages have been preliminarily completed, 25 villages are in progress, and only one village has not yet started. According to preliminary statistics from 58 villages, in addition to recovering 3,989 mu of land and more than 3,000 rooms, peasants also recovered a large amount of grain, clothing, silver dollars, etc., with a total value of more than 20 million yuan. That is, with a total population of 50,000 in the district, each person can receive 4,000 yuan, greatly increasing the peasants' production capital. This movement took poor and hired peasants as the backbone and paid attention to mobilizing backward peasants and uniting the broad masses of middle peasants, so the scale was larger than any previous one. Statistics from 70 villages show that more than 15,000 people participated in the movement (accounting for one-third of the district's population), and as many as 1,100 activists emerged. However, the following key issues have not received enough attention in the movement: First, there is a bias towards "getting internal goods" and relaxing the resolution of land issues. For example, Datun is a village where the land issue has been resolved more thoroughly, but recently it was discovered that the dozens of mu of land that the landlord should return to the peasants have not yet been returned; in Yanjia Tai and Qilin Tai, more than one qing that should be returned have not been returned; Second, some villages have not regarded speaking out about suffering as an important link in enlightening the masses, but only regarded speaking out about suffering as making suggestions, so the ideological mobilization is still very poor; Third, the construction of mass organizations has been neglected. For example, only 60 members of peasant associations and 13 militiamen have been developed in the 17 key villages in Chengguan, and even no one has been developed in some villages. In response to the above situation, the district has determined that the next stage's policy is: villages that have initially completed land redistribution must conduct a land inventory; villages that are in progress must focus on thoroughly resolving land issues. Special attention must be paid to ideological mobilization and organizational construction. The land redistribution movement in the district is now accelerating, striving to be completed thoroughly before February 15.

　　经过猛烈运动封建尾巴被割掉
    左权五区完成土地改革
    七百七十五户赤贫上升中农
    林县城关区四十六村初步完成填补
    【本报左权讯】左权五区土地改革胜利完成。该区这次彻底实现耕者有其田翻身运动的规模，较四二年减租及四三年反奸运动为猛烈和深入。在很短时期，全区二十一个乡村，七十五个自然村，一万余群众均全部卷入运动，共割掉封建尾巴一百零九户，调解农民内部疙瘩问题二百十九件。各村新老干部积极分子在解开内部疙瘩后，即团结一致向封建地主展开猛烈斗争。经过普遍的诉苦刨根运动，农民思想觉悟大提高，封建统治者用来支配农民痛苦生活的良心命运思想，已在翻身群众中逐渐丧失作用。广大农民撕掉了对地主情面良心残余后，狡猾地主隐藏的封建尾巴均都揭发出来，五区不仅发动村与村互相揭发自报，对外区地主隐藏物资也报告村政府送还原村。统计全区共清查出土地六千一百一十九亩半，房二千九百七十六间，牲口三百三十头，羊两千零二十只，家具九千五百三十九件，衣服四千零八十件，现洋一万四千七百三十八元及元宝铜器很多，全区有二千八百七十六户贫苦农民分得果实，七百七十五户赤贫上升中农。翻身农民为了帮助贫寒村农民弟兄翻身，纷纷捐赠土地财物，羊角援助贫村石炭窑土地三十亩、款五万余元。新店赠给后庄二十万元。西黄漳除帮助东黄漳西山两编村翻身外，还援助七区上交漳十一亩好水地，认真实现全面填平补齐。（仁杰树、屏泽民）
    【本报太行二日电】林县城关区于上月二十一日，检查全区填补运动。该区填补开始于去年十二月中旬，截至一月十九日，全区七十二个行政村中，已有四十六个村初步完成，二十五个村正在进行中，只一个村尚未开始。据五十八个村初步统计：农民除又收回土地三千九百八十九亩、房三千余间外，尚有大量的粮食衣物大洋等，总值在两万万元以上。即以全区五万人计，每人亦可分得四千元，大大增加了农民生产资本。这次运动是以贫雇农为骨干并注意发动了落后农民，团结了广大中农，所以规模比过去任何一次都大。七十个村统计，参加运动的人即在一万五千以上（占全区人口三分之一），涌现出积极分子亦达一千一百人。但运动中对于以下几个主要问题仍然重视不够：一、偏重“搞内货”放松了土地问题的解决。如大屯是土地问题解决较彻底的村，最近又发现地主该退还农民的几十亩地仍未退给，阎家台，麒麟台应退未退的则在一顷以上；二、有些村庄，还没有把诉苦作为启发群众觉悟的重要环节，而把诉苦只当作提意见，因此，思想发动还很差；三、忽视群众组织建设，如城关基点十七个村，只发展了六十个农会会员，十三个民兵，甚至有的村一人也未发展。针对以上情况，该区确定下一阶段的方针是：填补初步完成的村要来一次土地清查；正在进行的村，要以彻底解决土地问题为中心。对于思想发动，组织建设要特别重视。现该区填补运动正在加速进行，争取二月十五日前彻底完成。
