Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. A Central News Agency dispatch from Guilin on the 15th reports: The Chennault Air Transport Team has established an office in Guilin. It commenced operations on the 15th. The team has added the Guilin-Guangzhou and Guilin-Shanghai routes to handle passenger and cargo transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. According to the Shanghai Wenhui Bao of the 16th of last month: Hongqiao Airport in the western suburbs of Shanghai has been designated by the Kuomintang authorities as the base for the Chennault Air Transport Team. All existing runways at the airport have been completely repaired. Three PLGR-type transport aircraft ordered by Chen from Manila have arrived in Shanghai and landed first. The team has leased Tianhe Huai Airport in Guangzhou as a landing site. This airport is the best of the four airports in Guangzhou and is currently used by the Kuomintang Air Force. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao of the 12th of last month: Since the Chiang government decided to hire Chennault as the chief advisor to the Civil Aviation Administration, Chen suggested to the Chiang government that the Kuomintang's China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC), and Chen's own air transport team be merged into a larger airline. However, this suggestion has not yet been acted upon. The Ta Kung Pao stated: The vast majority of the China National Aviation Corporation's shares are held by Americans. The Central Air Transport Corporation is nominally run by the Ministry of Communications, but the funds are borrowed from the four major families' banks: the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank.
