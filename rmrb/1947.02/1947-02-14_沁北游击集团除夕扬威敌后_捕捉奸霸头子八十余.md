    Qinbei Guerrilla Group Displays Might Behind Enemy Lines on New Year's Eve
    Capturing Over Eighty Local Tyrants and Despots
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch on the 11th] The Qin (River) North Guerrilla Group, under the slogans of "Serving the People and Building Merit" and "Protecting the People Behind Enemy Lines to Have a Good New Year," braved the snow to advance behind enemy lines on the eve of the Lunar New Year. After capturing local tyrants and despots, except for those with minor offenses who were released on the spot, over eighty major local tyrants and secret agents were captured alive. In just three days, the Qinbei puppet township government's self-defense corps and "homecoming corps" were mostly annihilated by our forces. The masses behind enemy lines were extremely excited and vied to comfort our army. The Xiuwu militia said excitedly before setting out, "We're going down to wish a Happy New Year to our families and fellow villagers." Some pointed to the guns on their shoulders and said, "We'll also wish a Happy New Year to the evil despots." When they arrived near Beizu Village, it was just dawn. The evil despots of the "homecoming corps" and the puppet self-defense forces were gathered drinking and playing cards. Our militia suddenly raised their guns and shouted, "Whoever moves will be shot dead first." Within minutes, thirty-one evil despots, puppet self-defense members, and security corps members were captured alive, and five long and short guns were seized. When the Wuzhi militia suddenly arrived at the home of Xing Rulian, the head of the Xinggao Village homecoming corps, Xing was kowtowing, praying for divine protection, when our Fourth District Chief Zhang Ming pounced on him and tied him up. Zhang Baoheng, Zhao Wenkui, Niu Zhengqing, and other reactionary landlords and evil despots of Chaishang Village were brought to justice. Other landlords held meetings and said, "We dare not engage in reactionary liquidation in the village. You know when the mountain people (referring to the militia) will come to get you." Qin Lizhi, a target of struggle in Qinhan Village, Bo'ai, even voluntarily sent someone from the city to hand over 20,000 yuan in public funds to the democratic government. This time, the militia also carried out a massive political offensive, posting slogans everywhere to publicize the victory news. In Wuzhi alone, thirty-four villages were covered. Every time our army left a village, the old and young, men and women, gathered to see them off until they were out of sight.

    沁北游击集团除夕扬威敌后
    捕捉奸霸头子八十余
    【本报太行十一日电】沁（河）北游击集团，在为民立功与“保卫敌后人民过好年”口号下，于旧历除夕冒雪挺进敌后，捕捉奸霸除罪轻者当场释放外，生俘大奸霸特务八十余人。仅历时三天，沁北伪乡公所自卫团还乡团即大部被我歼灭。敌后群众极为振奋，并争先慰劳我军。修武民兵出发前，兴奋的说：“下去给我们家属老乡们拜年”，有的指着肩上的枪说：“也给恶霸们拜个年”。到北俎近村时，天刚明，恶霸“还乡团”们与伪自卫团部队正群聚饮酒打牌，我民兵突举枪喝令：“谁动先打死谁”。数分钟内活捉恶霸伪自卫团保安团员三十一名，缴长短枪五支，武陟民兵突到邢高村还乡团长邢如连家时，邢正磕头求神保佑，当被我四区长张明挂扑上去将其按住捆起。柴尚村倒算地主恶霸张保恒，赵文魁，牛正清等三人被我正法，其他地主开会说：“咱在村上可不敢倒算，你知道山上（指民兵）啥时来拿你”？博爱秦韩庄斗争对象秦立志在城里亦自动派人交来民主政府两万元公款。此次民兵并进行了浩大政治攻势，到处贴标语宣传胜利消息，仅武陟即进行了三十四个村。每当我军离开一村时，老少男女齐集欢送，直到看不见时始返回。
