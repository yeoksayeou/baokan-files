　　Production and Land Reform Proceed Without Delay
    Ping Shun Winter Production Yields Huge Profits
    Winter Production in the Second District of Wuxiang Earns an Average Profit of Over Two Thousand Yuan Per Person
    [Report from this newspaper] Ping Shun has achieved great results in winter production. The first district made a profit of 15 million yuan in December. Their slogan is: "Production and land reform proceed without delay." The district organized more than 7,000 laborers, 500 livestock, more than 20 large cooperatives, and more than 100 small cooperatives. More than 3,000 women were organized for spinning, working tirelessly from dawn till dusk. In just one and a half months, Yangjingdi Village in the fifth district earned 2.8 million yuan. In Hongtigan, the sixth district, production began as soon as land reform concluded. All 100 livestock in the village were organized for transportation, earning 220,000 yuan in six days. The reasons for the great success are summarized as follows: (1) During land reform, the vast majority of middle peasants actively participated in speaking bitterness and shared the fruits of victory, which greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. For example, Lu Lian'gen, a middle peasant in Lujiakou, earned 15,000 yuan in one month alone. All 32 middle-peasant households in the village participated in transportation, earning 160,000 yuan. Because the land reform did not harm the newly wealthy farmers who had prospered through labor, it further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the middle peasants, who unanimously aimed to develop in the direction of "new wealthy farmers." (2) Land reform and production were combined. For example, cadres in Xiaowen Village divided the leadership. During the seven days of land reform, 32 people were assigned to transportation, earning 36,000 yuan. Those who remained, in addition to attending meetings during the day, men delivered manure to the fields early in the morning and at dusk, and women spun and wove at night, spinning more than 1,000 jin of cotton in seven days. (3) The relationship between cadres and the masses was harmonious. The estrangement between the two sides was eliminated during land reform, so they could wholeheartedly carry out winter production. At the same time, the distribution of the fruits of victory was rapid, fair, and reasonable. Everyone had a say during the distribution, and no one complained after the distribution. Therefore, production could begin immediately after land reform.
    [Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] Wuxiang's winter production, as of the end of December last year, has achieved more than in any previous year. At the county-wide labor hero conference in November last year, the goal of earning an average of 3,000 yuan per person was proposed, and significant results have been achieved in the past two months. According to statistics from the second district, profits in two months reached 59,005,500 yuan, with an average of 2,665.7 yuan earned per person, only a little over 300 yuan short of the standard of 3,000 yuan per person. A total of 9,016 male and female laborers participated, accounting for more than 80% of all male and female laborers. In the past, there were only six mutual aid societies in the district, but this winter the number has increased to 100. Among the 4,985 men participating in mutual aid, 2,188 are engaged in transportation, indicating that the transportation industry has greatly developed. In Liuhexi and Zhaohexi in the fourth district, 37 households with 192 people earned more than 583,000 yuan in two months, with an average of over 3,000 yuan per person. However, the county's recent inspection found that the integration of production with preparations for this year's agricultural production (accumulating fertilizer, transporting coal, etc.) was not good enough. The county leadership has proposed: "Pay attention to the integration of agricultural and sideline production with land reform work to achieve success in both turning over and production without delay. Strive for further achievements."

　　生产查减两不误
    平顺冬季生产获巨利
    武乡二区冬季生产平均每人获利二千余元
    【本报讯】平顺各地冬季生产，获得巨大成绩。一区十二月份即获利千五百万元，他们的口号是：“生产查减两不误”，该区组织起劳力七千多个，牲口五百头，大合作社二十余座，小型合作社一百多个，组织起纺妇三千多个，起早搭黑人人不闲。五区羊井底村仅一月半时间，即赚洋二百八十万元。六区虹梯关，查减甫告结束，就转入生产，全村一百头牲口全部组织起来运输，六天即赚洋二十二万元，总结获得巨大成绩原因：（一）查减中广大中农都积极参加了诉苦，并分得果实，因而生产情绪特别高涨。如路家口中农路连根一人在一月中即赚洋一万五千元，全村卅二户中农都参加运输，赚洋十六万元。由于在查减中，对劳动发家的新富农没有损害，故更激发中农生产情绪，一致向着“新富农”方向发展。（二）查减与生产结合。如孝文村干部分工领导，在七天查减中，抽出三十二个人运输，赚洋三万六千元，留下的人除白天开会外，男人们清早黄昏往地送粪，妇女们夜里纺织，七天中纺花一千多斤。（三）干部和群众关系融洽，在查减中双方隔阂消除了，故能全力进行冬季生产，同时分果实迅速、公平、合理，分时人人都说话，分后人人无话说，因而在查减后，能立即转入生产。
    【本报长治讯】武乡冬季生产，截至去年十二月底止，所获成绩超过以往任何一年。该县在去年十一月的全县劳英大会上，提出每人平均要赚到三千元的目标，两月来已获显著成绩。二区统计：两月获利达五千九百万五千五百元，每人平均已获二千六百六十五元七角，距每人三千元的标准只差三百余元。共参加男女劳力九千零一十六人，占所有男女劳力百分之八十以上，过去全区只有六个互助社，今冬即增至一百个，男人参加互助四千九百八十五人中，有二千一百八十八个从事运输，说明运输事业是大大发展了。四区刘河西、赵河西，共三十七户一百九十二人，两月即获利五十八万三千余元，每人平均则超过三千元，但该县此次检查，生产中对今年农业生产的准备工作（积肥，拉煤等）结合还不够好，县领导上已提出：“注意农副业结合与查减工作的结合，做到翻身生产两不误。争取进一步的成绩。”
