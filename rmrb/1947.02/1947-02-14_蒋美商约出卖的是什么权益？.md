What Interests Did the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty Sell Out?
Shi An

The Chiang-American Commercial Treaty is a new unequal treaty by which Chiang Kai-shek sells out China's interests. Although the traitors will play with the words "equality" and "reciprocity" in the text of the treaty, they are ultimately guilty and afraid. Even Ye Gongchao, a department director of the Chiang government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had to admit: "For example, if you are fifteen years old and I am five years old, and we sign an equal treaty, if you hit me, I will hit you back. This is naturally very equal, but no matter what, how can I, at five years old, beat you at fifteen years old?" It is clear that they understand this principle very well, so they dare not conduct the treaty negotiations openly. Because if the negotiations were conducted openly, they would inevitably be opposed by the people of the whole country, and the treason would become much more difficult. However, the Chiang Kai-shek's four major families dared to secretly negotiate this treaty, which sells out the interests of the Chinese people, with American imperialism in February of last year. After signing it on November 4th, before the people even had time to express their opposition, they completed the "legislative procedures" of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial government on the 9th of the same month and passed it in the Legislative Yuan. Chiang Kai-shek handed over the interests of the Chinese people to American imperialism without the Chinese people being aware of it. This also shows the determination of Chiang Kai-shek and the four major families to betray the country.

The basis of the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty was proposed by the United States, and the content was rarely modified. American imperialism, of course, wanted to satisfy its ambition to destroy China, so the terms were stipulated in great detail and meticulously, and every word and every sentence was selling out the interests of the Chinese people. To write in detail about what Chiang Kai-shek sold out is really beyond my ability. Let's talk about a few major issues.

1.  "Industrial America, Agricultural China"; "Capital America, Labor China."

According to the provisions of Articles 2 to 5 of the treaty, Americans or American companies, in addition to engaging in science, education, religion, and charity in China, can also engage in commerce, open factories, engage in financial undertakings, and mine minerals in China. Americans can do these things themselves, or they can participate in Chinese companies. Geographically, it includes the entire territory of China, which is even broader than what Japanese imperialism demanded from Yuan Shikai in the Twenty-One Demands. In terms of treatment, it must be the same as that of the Chinese people and Chinese companies, and there must be no discrimination or interference against Americans and American companies. These regulations hand over all of China's economic lifelines to American imperialism, allowing it to control them. According to these terms, on the one hand, American goods are imported into China in large quantities (currently it is already "nothing but American goods"), turning China into a commodity market for the United States, sucking the blood of the Chinese people, and realizing what Japanese imperialism advocated in the past: "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China," into "Industrial America, Agricultural China." On the other hand, American capital will also enter China in large quantities, turning China into an investment market for American capital, directly setting up factories and mines in China, directly squeezing the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, and plundering China's resources. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government has already signed contracts with American companies to allow them to set up oil factories, cement factories, shipyards, chemical industrial factories, and power plants in our country. The light metal resources in Shandong, Taiwan, and Northeast China, and the antimony and tungsten mines in Yunnan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces are also allowed to be exploited by the United States, realizing "Capital America, Labor China," making China's economic relationship with the United States the same as that of the Philippines with the United States and India with Britain. The Chinese people will become the slaves of American imperialism, and China's industry and commerce will completely collapse as a result. Xinhua Daily in Chongqing reported last July that out of 4,055 factories in Shanghai, 3,163 had already closed down. Due to the dumping of American goods, it is not known how many more industrial and commercial enterprises will close down by the end of the year. This is the inevitable result of the entry of American goods and American capital into China. At the same time, the dumping of American agricultural products into China will also harm China's rural economy. Currently, American cotton has become a major commodity imported into China. Because its price is lower than domestic cotton, domestic cotton has become almost unsalable in Shanghai. The so-called treatment of American-run companies in China being the same as that of Chinese companies is actually more favorable than that of Chinese companies. The arbitrary taxation and various restrictions imposed by the four major families' dictatorial rule on Chinese industrialists and businessmen can be protected by American companies. Moreover, the so-called participation in Chinese companies is the cooperation between American capital and the four major families. Through this cooperation, they can also obtain privileges from the dictatorial government of the four major families. For example, the Sino-American Industrial Company, mainly led by Chennault and jointly formed with Soong Mei-ling and others, is allowed by the traitorous and dictatorial government of the four major families to prohibit China National Aviation Corporation from flying on the one hand, and to specially allow Chennault's company to operate in China on the other hand. Also, due to this cooperation, the United States invested in the Yuehan Railway in China, and also gained a foothold in the Yuehan Railway. These actual situations are the best explanation of these terms.

2.  Opening the Doors Wide, Dumping of American Goods

According to the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the treaty, China shall not prohibit the export or import of American goods to China, whether directly or indirectly; Paragraph 2 stipulates that the customs duties levied and the methods of collection shall be the same as those for its own people; According to Article 18, the inland tax on American goods should be the same as that on Chinese goods. These provisions are intended to prevent China from adopting a protective tariff policy, so that China cannot prohibit the import of certain American goods in order to protect its own industries, nor can it increase the import tax on American goods. In fact, even if the import tax is increased, American capital has already directly set up factories in China to manufacture and dump goods locally, and we cannot protect our own industries. The inland tax on American goods is the same as that on Chinese goods, but in reality, under the dictatorial rule of the four major families, the taxes borne by Chinese goods are much higher than those on American goods. Not only are there these provisions in the treaty, but Chiang Kai-shek has also handed over the right to collect customs duties (Inspector General of Customs) to an American, Li Du, and even the Deputy Inspector General is a foreigner. Therefore, these clauses in the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty only protect the dumping of American goods in China and cut off China's tariff autonomy.

3.  Inland River and Coastal Navigation Rights All Offered as Gifts

According to the provisions of Articles 21 to 24 of the treaty, American ships can navigate to all open ports, and can load and unload goods along the way. Regardless of which port they depart from or which port they arrive at, no transit tax shall be levied, and the treatment shall be the same as that of Chinese ships. Article 24, Paragraph 2 stipulates that when the right to inland river navigation or coastal trade is granted to any third country, it must also be granted to the United States. In fact, the traitorous and dictatorial government of the four major families has already opened up inland river navigation rights to the United States. American ships can navigate everywhere in China. Last year, the permission for foreign ships to navigate in the Beijing, Wuhu, and Hankou rivers in China caused opposition from the Chinese shipping industry, but it had no effect. Moreover, American capital can also set up companies in China, or cooperate with the capital of the four major families, to enjoy the rights of coastal trade and inland river navigation in our country. For example, Chennault's company is allowed to equip its own ships and travel to and from various commercial ports along the Yangtze River. Therefore, these clauses actually sell out our country's coastal trade and inland river navigation rights. Since the treatment of American ships must be the same as that of Chinese ships, this makes it impossible for China's shipping industry to compete with the American shipping industry. As a result, China's foreign trade shipping, China's coastal trade, and inland river navigation will all be controlled by American imperialism. (To be continued)

    蒋美商约出卖的是什么权益？
    适安
    蒋美商约是蒋介石出卖中国利益的新的不平等条约。虽然卖国贼们在条约文字上，会玩弄“平等”与“互惠”，但作贼究竟心虚，连蒋政府外交部的司长叶公超也不得不承认：“比如你十五岁，我五岁，你我之间，订立一个平等条约，你打我一掌，我也还你一掌。这自然是很平等了，可是无论如何，五岁的我怎能打胜十五岁的你呢”，可知他们是很清楚这个道理的，因而他们就不敢把商约的谈判公开进行。因为如果公开进行谈判，必然要遭到全国人民的反对，卖国就会增加了许多困难。不过，蒋介石四大家族，竟然胆敢于去年二月间偷偷摸摸和美帝国主义开始谈判这种出卖中国人民利益的条约，在十一月四日签字之后，又使人民还来不及发表反对意见，于同月九日，就完成了蒋介石卖国独裁政府的“立法手续”，由立法院通过了。蒋介石在中国人民毫不知觉中间，双手把中国人民的利益送给了美帝国主义，这也正说明了蒋介石等四大家族的卖国决心。
    蒋美商约的底本，是美国提出的，内容很少修改，美帝国主义当然要如意的满足他灭亡中国的野心，所以条款规定得非常详细，无微不至，而每一字每一句又都在出卖中国人民的利益。要想详细写出蒋介石究竟出卖了一些什么东西，实在是笔不胜书。我们且就几个主要的问题来谈一谈吧。
    一、“工业美国、农业中国”；“资本美国、劳力中国。”
    按条约第二条至第五条的规定，美国人或美国的公司，除了在中国作科学、教育、宗教及慈善事业外，还可以在中国经营商务，开设工厂，还可以从事金融事业，和开采矿产。这一些，美国人可以自己作，也可以参加中国的公司。从地区说，是包括中国全领土，比二十一条中日本帝国主义向袁世凯所要求的还要广。从待遇说，要和中国人民中国公司是一样，不能对美国人美国公司有什么歧视和干涉。这些规定，就是把中国的一切经济命脉，送给美帝国主义，让其控制。根据这些条款，一方面美国货物大量输入中国（目前已是“无货不美”了），使中国变成美国的商品市场，吸取中国人民的膏血，使过去日本帝国主义所倡导的“工业日本，农业中国”，实现为“工业美国，农业中国”，另一方面，美国的资本也要大量进入中国，使中国变成美国资本的投资市场，在中国直接设厂开矿，直接榨取中国人民的血汗，掠夺中国的资源。蒋介石卖国政府，就已经和美国公司订立了合同，让美国公司在我国设立石油厂、水泥厂、轮船制造厂、化学工业制造厂和电力工厂、还有山东、台湾、东北等地的轻金属资源，和滇、湘、赣等省的锑矿钨矿，也让美国开采，实现“资本美国，劳力中国”。使中国与美国的经济关系，变成和菲律宾与美国、印度与英国的关系一样。中国人民将变成美帝国主义的牛马，中国的工商业也将因此而完全垮台。去年七月重庆新华日报载，上海工厂四○五五家，已倒闭者三一六三家，年关因美货的倾销，还不知有多少工商业关门。这就是美国货物、美国资本进入中国必然的结果。同时，美国农产品输入中国的倾销，也将要危害中国的农村经济。目前美棉已成为美国输入中国货物的大宗，因其价格低于国产，使国产棉花，在上海已几至无人问津。所谓美国人在中国所经营的公司，其待遇和中国人的一样，那实际上的待遇，比中国人的是更为优厚的。四大家族的独裁统治，对于中国工商业者所施行的横征暴敛及各种限制，美国公司是可以得到保护的。并且所谓参加中国公司，就是美国资本和四大家族的合作，由于这种合作，还可以从四大家族的独裁政府获得特权。比如以陈纳德为主体的和宋美龄等合组的中美实业公司，就是由四大家族的卖国独裁政府，一方面禁止大华航空公司飞行，一方面特许陈纳德公司在华的经营。又由于这种合作，美国向中国粤汉路投资，在粤汉路也插上了一脚。这一些实际情形，就是这些条款最好的解释。
    二、国门大开、美货倾销
    按条约第十六条第一款规定，不论美国对中国的输出或输入，直接或间接，中国一概不能禁止；第二款规定所课关税及征收方法，应与本国人民同样待遇；按第十八条规定美国货在中国的内地税应与中国货同样待遇。这些规定，就是要中国不能采取保护的关税政策，使中国不能因为要保护自己的某种工业，而禁止某种美货的输入，也不能提高美货的入口税。其实，即使提高入口税，美国资本已在中国直接设厂制造，就地倾销，我们也是不能保护自己工业的。内地税，美国货物和中国货物一样，实际上在四大家族独裁统治之下，中国货物所负担的税款，要比美货高得多。不仅条约上有了这些规定，而且蒋介石还把海关收税权（总税务司），早已交给了美国人李度掌握，连副税务司也是外国人。所以蒋美商约中的这些条款，只是保护美货在中国的倾销，断送了中国的关税自主权。
    三、内河、沿海航行权一律奉送
    按条约第二十一条至二十四条的规定，凡是开放的港口，美船都可以通航，可以沿途卸货载货，不管从何港口出发，也不管到何港口，都不得课过境税，待遇应与中国船舶一样。第二十四条第二款规定内河航行或沿海贸易的权利，给予任何第三国时，也必须给美国。实际上四大家族的卖国独裁政府，早已向美国开放了内河航行权。美国船舶在中国到处可以通航。去年曾经为了准许外国船舶在中国京、芜、汉航行，引起了中国航业的反对，但是没有效果。何况美国资本还可到中国设立公司，或者和四大家族的资本合作，用这种办法来享有我国沿海贸易及内河航行的权利。如陈纳德公司，就准自备轮船，往来于长江沿岸的各商埠。所以这些条款，实际上就是出卖了我国沿海贸易及内河航行的权利，由于对美国轮船的待遇须与中国轮船一样，这使中国的航业不能和美国航业竞争，结果中国对外贸易的航运，中国沿海贸易及内河航行，便都为美帝国主义所操纵。（待续）
