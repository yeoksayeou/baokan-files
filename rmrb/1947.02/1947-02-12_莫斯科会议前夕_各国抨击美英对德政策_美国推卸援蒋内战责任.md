	On the Eve of the Moscow Conference
	Various Countries Criticize the US and British Policies Towards Germany
	The United States Shrugs Off Responsibility for Aiding Chiang in the Civil War

	In another month, the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Moscow Conference will open. It is generally believed that the two major issues related to this conference have recently become the focus of the international situation.

	Firstly, the German issue. The London Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference is currently studying the opinions of various small countries regarding the German peace treaty. In addition to discussing the German peace treaty, the Moscow Conference will undoubtedly review the situation of the Four Powers' control over Germany since the Potsdam Conference. Recently, Soviet newspapers have continuously exposed that the Potsdam Agreement has not been implemented in the Western occupation zones. Politically, Nazis and militarists are sheltered, and a large number of war criminals have been pardoned, so the work of German democratization has not been implemented. Economically, arms production continues, and the trusts, cartels, and financial oligarchs that supported the war of aggression during the war have not been liquidated. Britain and the United States are trying to restore the industry in western Germany under their control, and most of the reparations agreements have not been fulfilled. This situation has recently aroused dissatisfaction among a wide range of people in Britain and the United States; not only left-wing people, but also liberals. The American Progressive Citizens Association recently issued a statement condemning the authorities for abandoning the Potsdam Resolution. Eleanor Roosevelt, Popper and others will convene 500 American celebrities early next month to discuss the German issue. Even more conservative people, such as British Conservative MP Law, and French Radical Party leader Herriot, have expressed anxiety about the chaotic situation in western Germany.

	Secondly, the China issue is also of concern to all parties. The US State Department announced on January 29th that the United States would withdraw from the China Three-Person Committee. Most American newspapers believe that this does not mean a change in the US policy towards China. The Christian Science Monitor called it only a "change in tactics and procedures." The Soviet Izvestia and Pravda believe that this is the result of the United States' failure to "mediate" for a year. According to a TASS reporter, this is because "the United States believes that the upcoming Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference may discuss the implementation of the 1945 Three Foreign Ministers' agreement on the China issue," fearing that the United States will be "in an embarrassing position" and is therefore putting on a show to prevaricate. US Senator Mansfield recently suggested that the US, Soviet Union, Britain, and China should confer on the China issue. The British News Chronicle also urged Foreign Secretary Bevin to take action on this.

	The above two major issues both involve the foreign policy of the United States. On the eve of this Moscow Conference, the expansionist elements in the United States are carrying out various diplomatic maneuvers. Vandenberg and Dulles, the spokesperson for Dewey, recently shouted for the restoration of Germany as a strong industrial power and the formation of a group with Western European countries. Many Republican members of Congress are also urging Marshall to report on foreign policy to the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, especially on the policy towards China. Marshall himself has stated that he guarantees "cooperation" with the Republican-controlled Congress and implements the so-called "bipartisan foreign policy." Therefore, what kind of policy the United States will adopt at the upcoming Moscow Conference has attracted attention from all parties. In any case, Bernes' so-called "tough policy toward the Soviet Union" has proven to be unworkable. The difficulties Marshall faces in attending the Moscow Conference this time are no less than those faced by Bernes. (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th)

### 莫斯科会议前夕  各国抨击美英对德政策  美国推卸援蒋内战责任

    莫斯科会议前夕
    各国抨击美英对德政策
    美国推卸援蒋内战责任
    再过一个月，四强外长莫斯科会议便揭幕了，一般认为与此次会议有关的两大问题，近来成为国际局势的焦点。
    首先是德国问题，伦敦外长助理会议目前正研究各小国对于对德和约的意见。莫斯科会议除了将讨论对德和约问题外，无疑将检讨波茨顿会议以来四强管制德国的情形。近来苏联报纸不断揭露西方占领区中未履行波茨顿协定，政治上庇护纳粹及军国主义者，赦免大批战犯，使德国民主化的工作亦未实行，经济上军火生产继续进行，战时支持侵略战争的托拉斯、卡特尔及其金融寡头均未被清算。英美两国正力图在其控制下，恢复德国西部工业，赔偿协定亦多未履行。此种情形，近来亦引起英美国内广大人士的不满；非仅左翼人士，而且自由主义分子亦然。美国进步公民协会近发表声明，谴责当局背弃波茨顿决议，罗斯福夫人、泼贝尔等将于下月初召集五百美国名流讨论德国问题。甚至较保守人士如英保守党议员劳氏等，以及法国急造党领袖赫里欧等，亦对德国西部的混乱情况表示焦虑。
    其次，中国问题亦为各方所关切。美国务院于上月二十九日宣布美国退出中国三人委员会，此举美国大多数报纸认为非美国对华政策改变之谓。基督教科学箴言报称之仅为“策略上及手续上之变动”，苏联消息报及真理报认为这是美国一年来“调处”失败的结果。据塔斯社记者报导：这是因为“美国认为未来莫斯科外长会议可能讨论一九四五年三国外长关于中国问题协议之执行问题”，恐怕届时美国会“处于难堪的地位”，乃故作姿态，用以搪塞。美议员孟斯菲德近建议美、苏、英、中四国会商中国问题，英新闻纪事报亦敦促外相贝文对此采取行动。
    上述两大问题均牵涉美国的对外政策，美扩张主义分子在此莫斯科会议前夕，正作各种外交上的策动。范登堡与杜威的代言人杜勒斯，日前叫喊恢复德国为强大工业国，并与西欧诸国结成集团。许多共和党议员又催促马歇尔向参众两院外委会报告外交政策，特别是对华政策。马歇尔本人已声言保证与共和党控制之国会“合作”，并实行所谓“两党外交政策”。因之美国在行将召开的莫斯科会议，将采取何种政策，已为各方注目。不论如何，过去贝纳斯的所谓“对苏强硬政策”已证明是实行不通的，这次马歇尔出席莫斯科会议时所面临的困难，自不亚于贝纳斯。（新华社延安九日电）
