　　Setting Mass Mobilization Goals and Work Discipline:
    Juye Turn-Over Teams Compete for Merit
    Ming De
    [Report from the Jiluyu Front of the People's Government] The peasant turn-over teams distributed to various counties have only been working for a week and have already achieved many results. They have ignited an enthusiastic campaign to earn merit. The Juye Central Team's detachments have automatically proposed the following slogans as their goals: 1. Rewards for those who truly mobilize the masses to liberate themselves and thoroughly solve the land problem. 2. Rewards for those who, after mobilizing the masses, establish their own organizations, transform the village government, and organize the peasants' own armed forces, which can truly play a role. 3. Rewards for those who cultivate peasant leaders and have a good relationship with district-level cadres, and whose work does not decline after the turn-over team leaves. To ensure the realization of the above goals, they have automatically proposed three major disciplines: 1. Do not eat the landlords' food, do not live in the landlords' houses, and do not accept gifts from the landlords. Violators will be punished. 2. Do not purchase the fruits of struggle, do not accept gifts from the peasant association, and strictly prohibit corruption. 3. No whoring, no gambling, and no beating people. Violations of the above three articles will be severely punished. Currently, our detachments are working hard towards this goal. In addition to holding various large and small meetings in Bigan Temple, the Fourth Detachment has reached over 600 poor women. After the female staff members of the turn-over team explained the principles of turn-over to them, they expressed many grievances that they had nowhere to express. Due to the Kuomintang army's massacre and suppression of the peasant associations, the peasants initially demanded to reorganize a more consolidated peasant association, and the women also demanded to organize a women's association. The First Detachment, with Zhouzhuang as the center, has united the poor villages of Xinghai to struggle against the local despotic landlords. Because the land within two miles around Xinghai Village has been occupied by the despotic landlords of Zhouzhuang, they have shouted the slogan "Recover the land for spring plowing." Currently, the masses in various parts of Juye are requesting the turn-over team to go to their villages. (Ming De)

　　订出发动群众目标和工作纪律
    巨野翻身队竞赛立功
    明德
    【本报冀鲁豫前线野政讯】分到各县之农民翻身队，刚进行一周工作，已收到不少成绩，他们已燃起热烈的立功运动。巨野中队各分队，已自动提出以下口号作为他们的行动目标：一、真正发动群众自己起来解放自己，彻底解决了土地问题者奖。二、群众发动起来后，建立了自己的组织，改造了村政权，及组织了农民的自己武装，能真正起作用者奖。三、培养了农民领袖，并与区级干部融洽，翻身队离开工作不会下降者奖。为保证上述目标实现，他们又自动提出了三大纪律：一、不吃地主的饭，不住地主的房子，不接受地主的礼物，违犯此条者罚。二、不购买斗争果实，不接受农会送礼，严禁贪污。三、不嫖不赌不打人。违反上述三条者，给予严重处分。现我分队均本着这个目标努力。四小队在比干庙除召开了各种大小会议外，仅贫苦妇女，即到六百余人，当翻身队的女工作员向她们讲过翻身道理后，她们纷纷诉说内心许多无处可诉的苦楚。由于蒋介石军队对于农会的屠杀镇压，因此农民在开始都要求重新组织更巩固的农会，而妇女也要求组织妇女会。一小队则以周庄为中心，将辛垓的小贫苦村庄联合起来，向恶霸地主斗争，因辛垓村周围二里内的土地，都被周庄恶霸地主所霸占，他们已喊出“收回土地春耕”的口号。现巨野各地群众，都纷纷要求翻身队到他们村庄去。（明德）
