    To Improve Military-Government and Military-Civilian Relations
    The Army Must Take Primary Responsibility

    To the Editor:
    Regarding Comrade Lu Zhimo's article "What Should the Government and Army Do in the Support and Love Movement" in the "Reader Service Column" on January 28th, I feel some points are worth discussing.
    According to Chairman Mao's thinking, if there are any disharmonies in military-government and military-civilian relations, the army should first make self-criticism and be responsible for improving the relationship between the two sides. The Political Department of the Military Region's January 13th instruction also writes: "In resolving military-government and military-civilian relations, many experiences have proven that when an attitude and method of only examining oneself and not criticizing others is adopted, the relationship immediately improves after both sides conduct self-criticism."
    However, Comrade Lu Zhimo's approach is not like this. He starts by asking what local party and government comrades should do, forgetting that the army should and must first make self-criticism in resolving certain disputes. At the same time, most of his opinions are about what local party and government comrades should do, while the remaining small portion is what the army should do. This makes it easy for people to feel that local party and government should take more responsibility for military-government relations. To improve military-government relations, one must first start from the local level. Given that some army cadres still hold this view, it is clear that the above-mentioned opinions will not help the army's support-the-government and cherish-the-people movement, nor will it help improve the overall military-government and military-civilian relations. This is the point I feel, and I don't know if it is right or wrong, please use it as a reference.

### 改善军政、军民关系军队要负主要责任

专栏：

    改善军政、军民关系
    军队要负主要责任编者同志：
    一月二十八日的“读者服务栏”中，鲁之沫同志的“拥爱运动中政府和军队应作些什么”一文里，我觉得有些意见值得商榷。
    按照毛主席的思想，军政、军民关系上如有不和谐的地方，军队首先要做自我批评，并负责改善双方关系。军区政治部一月十三日指示也这样写着：“在解决军政、军民的关系上，许多经验证明：凡是采取了只检讨自己不批评别人的态度与办法的，结果双方经过自我检讨，关系马上得到改善。
    可是鲁之沫同志的提法却不是这个样子的。他一开头就提出地方党政同志应当做些什么，而忘了军队在解决某些纠纷上应该而且必须首先做自我批评，同时他的意见中，一大半是要求地方党政同志做些什么，其余一小半才是军队所要做的，这会使人容易感到：军政关系，地方党政要多负责任；要改善军政关系，首先须从地方做起，在目前军队干部中，还有一些人正是持着这种观点的情况下，显然上述意见的提法对部队的拥政爱民运动，是不会有什么帮助的，同时对整个军政关系与军民关系的改善也不会有什么帮助的。这是我所感到的一点意见，不知对与不对，请你们参考。
