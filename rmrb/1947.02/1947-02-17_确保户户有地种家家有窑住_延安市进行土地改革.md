Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th – The Yan'an Municipal Government recently dispatched more than 50 cadres to the Northwest District, East District, and South District to assist district and township governments in commencing land reform in Yan'an City, to achieve the goal of "ensuring every household has land to cultivate and every family has a cave dwelling." According to Mayor Xie Huaide, who spoke to reporters, cadres previously considered Yan'an a city issue, not a rural issue, and regarded the area within ten li of Yan'an as a so-called "united front zone," resulting in some areas where land had been distributed allowing landlords to reclaim the land. In some areas, such as East Suburb Township, only about 30 out of more than 110 households had land. In areas where land had been distributed (old areas), such as Peizhuang and Zaoyuan, half of the farmers also had no arable land. In undistributed areas such as Xinshi Township, Wenhua Township, and South Suburb Township, the majority were landless. Mayor Xie also pointed out that another special issue of the land problem in Yan'an City is the issue of organizations and the masses of farmers. In recent years, some organizations, in order to develop organizational agricultural production, have not hesitated to rent land from landlords at high prices, causing many landlords to turn to extracting land from farmers. Therefore, in resolving the land problem in Yan'an City, it is also necessary to mobilize all organizations to follow the instructions of the Northwest Bureau, prioritizing the care of farmers to resolve the problems between organizations and farmers. At present, the municipal government has made this work its primary focus. Only a few people have been retained in the municipal-level organs, and the remaining twenty-odd cadres have all gone to the countryside. Organs such as the Yangjialing, Zaoyuan, and Wangjiaping Party Schools have also sent 30 cadres to assist, striving to basically resolve the above problems in one and a half to two months.

　　确保户户有地种家家有窑住
    延安市进行土地改革
    【新华社延安十四日电】延安市政府于日前特派遣干部五十余人，分赴西北区、东区、南区协助区乡政府，开始进行延安市的土地改革，以达到“户户有地种，家家有窑住”之目的。据市长谢怀德语记者，过去干部认为延市为城市问题，不是农村问题，且以延市十里以内为所谓“统战区”，以致部分分配过土地的地区，听任地主又抽回土地。有些地区，如东郊乡，一百一十多户只有三十多户有地；分配过的（老区），如裴庄、枣园等地，也有半数农民没有耕地；未分配区如新市乡、文化乡、南郊乡等，则更多数无地。谢市长并指出，延市土地问题之另一特殊问题即机关与农民群众的问题，因近几年来，有的机关为了发展机关农业生产，不惜以高价向地主租地，致使不少地主转向农民抽地，因此解决延市土地问题中，亦须发动各机关遵照西北局指示，以照顾农民为第一，来解决机关和农民间的问题。目前市政府已以此工作为首要中心，市一级机关只留了几个人，其余二十几个干部已全部下乡，杨家岭、枣园、王家坪党校等机关，亦派干部三十个人协助，争取月半至两月大体解决以上问题。
