　　[Our newspaper's front line in Ji, Lu, and Yu, first dispatch] The number of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers who are tired of war and deserting is increasing daily. The county and district governments of Ji, Lu, and Yu have universally established reception centers specifically to receive Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers who desert and refuse to fight. Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers who come to the reception centers are guaranteed preferential treatment, and assistance is provided to help them find suitable employment. Those who wish to return home are escorted home. Those who bring weapons and military supplies are given bonuses accordingly. The center has printed a large number of leaflets and distributed them in the Chiang-occupied areas and mobilized the masses to help Chiang Kai-shek's deserters and soldiers refusing to fight to come to the center. (Nai Yi)
　　[Our newspaper's Shihuiqu Dispatch] On the night of January 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers Bai Zhongxin, Fang Yongai, and others, totaling seven men from Huolu, unwilling to be deceived and act as cannon fodder for Chiang's bandits' civil war, revolted against the civil war. They secretly escaped from the city with one American-made light machine gun, one submachine gun, one pistol, five rifles, and one hand grenade. They arrived safely in a certain area of our district via Miao Qieshan in Jingxing and were warmly welcomed by the local people's soldiers. Bai and others said, "When we escaped, we were not far from the city when we were discovered by Chiang's soldiers in the city, who fired machine guns at us. We fought and fled. They were afraid that the Eighth Route Army had set up an ambush in the suburbs, so they dared not pursue us." Bai also said on behalf of the insurgent soldiers, "We are here to defend our motherland, oppose the civil war, and oppose the combination of Chiang and the United States to enslave China." They also requested to join the Eighth Route Army and participate in the patriotic self-defense war to defeat Chiang Kai-shek. (Chen Peixin)
　　[Our newspaper's Anyang Dispatch] Zhang Defa, a soldier from the puppet army Liu Luoxian's unit stationed in the southern bunker of Shiguan Village, Anyang, escaped to our district on the night of January 16th because he could not bear the abuse. He is from Zhangzhuang Village, Zhangde. He was originally a porter peddler, with an elderly mother and wife at home, barely able to make a living. Last year, in the fourth month of the old lunar calendar, he was captured by the puppet army Liu's unit and forced to serve as a soldier in the sixth company. Because of the Lunar New Year, his longing for home grew stronger. He wanted to take the opportunity to run away, but was discovered by the company commander and suffered severe beatings, his face was bruised and swollen, and he fainted several times. The more Zhang thought about it, the more he hated it, so he took the opportunity to run away on the night of the 16th. When he saw our militiamen and the masses, he burst into tears. Our county headquarters immediately invited him to eat and comforted him in every way. He was deeply moved and firmly said, "I will recover from my injuries and take revenge. I will fight them to the end!"

    【本报冀鲁豫前线一日电】蒋军士兵厌战逃亡日众，冀鲁豫各县区政府普遍设立招待所，专门招待蒋军逃亡及罢战官兵，凡来招待所之蒋军官兵，负责予以优待，并保证帮助寻觅适当职业，愿回家者则护送回家。携带武器及军用品者，并分别发予奖金。该所已印制大批传单散发蒋占区，并动员群众帮助蒋军逃兵及罢战官兵来所。（乃一）
    【本报石获区讯】一月十五日夜，获鹿蒋军士兵白忠信，方永爱等七名，不愿受骗，充当蒋贼内战炮灰，起义反对内战，携美造轻机枪、冲锋枪各一挺，手枪一枝，步枪五枝，手榴弹一枚，秘密跳城逃出。经井陉苗袷山安抵我区某地，受当地子弟兵热烈欢迎。白等说：“我们逃出时，离城不远，就被城内蒋军发觉，用机枪向我们扫射，我们边打边逃。他们怕八路军在城郊设伏，不敢追击。”白又代表起义士兵说：“我们是为保卫祖国，反对内战，反对蒋美结合奴役中国而来。”并要求参加八路军，参加爱国自卫战争，打垮蒋介石。（陈培新）
