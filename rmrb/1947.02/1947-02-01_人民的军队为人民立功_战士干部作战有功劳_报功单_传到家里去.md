    The People's Army Performs Meritorious Service for the People
　　Soldiers and Cadres Receive Commendations for Combat Success, "Report of Merit" Sent Home
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 29th dispatch] A certain unit's Merit Citation Committee issued a large number of "Report of Merit" forms to commend the families of cadres and soldiers who had performed meritorious service in combat. After the Jin-Yu Campaign, in which the main force of Fang Xianjue's 88th Division, a direct descendant of Chiang Kai-shek, was annihilated, the Mutual Aid Merit Citation Committees at all levels of a certain unit participating in the battle actively evaluated the heroic and exemplary deeds of soldiers and cadres since the recovery of Juye, recorded them in the Merit Book, and filled out "Report of Merit" forms for those who had rendered great service and sent them to the county government of their place of origin for forwarding to their families. Han Er'mao, a soldier of the 3rd Company of a certain unit, held his ground in a heavy encirclement. Although he suffered multiple serious injuries, he still held the original position and fought hard. It was decided to record a major merit and report his achievements to his hometown of Lin County. In addition, Qian Tongxian, an acting platoon leader of the 8th Company, usually lived a hard life and never left his weapons. On the battlefield, in addition to rescuing martyr Cai Hao, he also picked up their guns one by one. The Merit Citation Committee recorded a major merit for him and reported his achievements to his family. Some cadres and soldiers whose hometowns are in the Chiang-occupied areas will be re-reported when peace and democracy are realized. The first batch of "Report of Merit" forms has already been sent out by the unit. (Fang De)

    人民的军队为人民立功
　　战士干部作战有功劳“报功单”传到家里去
    【本报冀鲁豫即线二十九日电】某部立功委员会发出大批报功单，向作战有功的干部战士家庭报功。金、鱼战役歼灭蒋介石嫡系八十八师方先觉部主力后，我参加作战部队某部各级互助立功委员会纷纷评定战士干部自收复巨野之战以来的英勇模范事迹，记入功劳簿，凡立大功者均填具报功单寄至原籍县政府，转报他们的家庭。某部三连战士韩二卯在重围中坚守，虽身负重伤数处，仍然扼守原阵地苦战，决定记大功一次，并向其原籍林县报功。又八连见习排副骞通线平时生活艰苦，时刻不离自己的武器，在战场上除抢救彩号烈士外，还把他们的枪一一拾回，立功委员会给他记大功一次，并向其家庭报功。有些干部战士原籍在蒋占区者，待和平民主实现时再行补报，现首批报功单业已由该部发出。（方德）
