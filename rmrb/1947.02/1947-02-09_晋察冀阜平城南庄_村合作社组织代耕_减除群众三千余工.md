Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, February 5th: The Chengnanzhuang Village Cooperative in Fuping, Jijing District, organized substitute farming for the families of soldiers and martyrs, reducing the burden on the masses by more than 3,000 workdays last year. Last year, at the end of the old lunar year, village cadres added 130,000 yuan (border currency) of preferential treatment funds collected through donations to the cooperative as a preferential treatment fund. Five long-term workers were hired to cultivate land for the families of soldiers and martyrs lacking labor. The workers' wages were paid from the dividends earned from the preferential treatment fund. The food and clothing of the hired workers were reasonably shared by the families of soldiers and martyrs. In total, last year, the five hired workers worked for eight months, thus solving the problem of substitute farming. Only 200 workdays were spent on temporarily assigning workers from the masses to help the families of soldiers and martyrs in production. Compared with the 3,496 workdays used for substitute farming in the previous year, the burden of substitute farming on the masses was greatly reduced. Due to the fixed substitute farming, the families of soldiers and martyrs also actively participated in cultivation, and grain production increased by two times compared with previous years.
