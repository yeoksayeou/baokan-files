To all fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region:

On November 4th of last year, Chiang Kai-shek and the United States signed a "Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation," selling China entirely. This is a great shame for China! This government, based on the will of all the people in the region, has designated this day as the National Humiliation Memorial Day. It is stipulated that a memorial meeting be held every year on November 4th, and the flag be flown at half-mast for one day to show solemn remembrance.

The people of the whole country fought hard for eight years in the War of Resistance against Japan, driving away Japanese imperialism and abolishing unequal treaties; but Chiang Kai-shek brought in an American imperialist, allowing it to interfere in China's internal affairs, allowing its naval, land, and air forces to station and operate in China's territorial waters, land, and airspace, allowing it to occupy or use our national defense border fortresses and military bases, and allowing it to participate in our military organization and training. This is selling out China's military and national defense. After successively selling out various sovereign rights piecemeal in exchange for military and economic assistance to fight the civil war, he gave the Chinese people such a general bill of sale, placing our entire nation in the position of slaves of American imperialism.

Everyone should have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of this treaty's harm to our country and nation. This treaty treats American imperialists as masters of China. Rights that Chinese people cannot enjoy, Americans can enjoy in China, and the Kuomintang government must especially help them and protect them. According to the content of this treaty, with a document from the U.S. government, Americans can buy land and build houses, operate businesses, and set up factories in China; American planes can fly freely in China; American ships can sail freely in China; Americans can mine at will in China; Americans can enjoy various freedoms that Chinese people cannot enjoy. In short, China has become the China of American imperialism! In the past, Yuan Shikai was still apprehensive about selling out the country, but now Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country without any scruples, completely, doing what Yuan Shikai did not dare to do. Chiang Kai-shek has replaced Wang Jingwei, and the United States has replaced Japan. And his cunning, deceit, and shamelessness surpass them. Wang Jingwei explained his betrayal of the nation and country as a traitor and running dog by "saving the country through a curved path," while Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country is disguised as being one of the "Big Five" and uses "equality and mutual benefit" to deceive the people. Everyone knows that today China has absolutely no power to talk about "equality and mutual benefit" with the United States in economic terms. Chinese people themselves are discarding goods on the ground, seeking only to survive and impossible to do so. How can they have the power to set up factories, open mines, and build railways in the United States? How can they have airplanes and ships to sail to the United States to do business? Moreover, how can industrial production compete with American commodities?! Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "equality and mutual benefit" only "benefits" the United States, offering China's economic lifeline to the United States and turning China into a colony of the United States. Isn't that the reality? In the past year, except for the Liberated Areas, American goods have flooded the entire Kuomintang-controlled market. The industries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are bankrupt, Chinese goods stores are closing down, workers and shop assistants are unemployed, and farmers are starving and displaced. Isn't this the result of this "equality and mutual benefit"? Is it possible that Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary partisans are fools who do not understand this principle and fact and have been deceived by the United States? No! This is precisely the clever scheme of the collusion between Chiang and the United States: one side is willing to sell out, and the other is obsessed with aggression, and they use "equality and mutual benefit" as a cover, attempting to deceive the people and cover the eyes and ears of the world. There can be no more vicious and ruthless plan! But one hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of the world. As soon as the treaty was signed, public opinion across the country was in an uproar, and voices of opposition rose from all sides. Even fair-minded people abroad have begun to worry about China's future! The people in the Liberated Areas felt even more pain and anger, vowing to resolutely oppose it until it is cancelled. The solemn statement issued by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on February 1st of this year stated: "The Party does not recognize and will never assume any obligation for all foreign loans, all treaties that lose sovereignty and humiliate the country, and all other similar agreements and understandings concluded by the Kuomintang government alone after January 10, 1946, and all similar diplomatic negotiations that have not been approved by the Political Consultative Conference or have not been agreed to by the Party and other parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference." This is a solemn statement that represents the interests of all the Chinese people and is in line with the demands and will of all our compatriots in the region. The Committee of this government has specially telegraphed to Yan'an on behalf of the people of the entire region, expressing its firm support and seeking its implementation with practical strength.

Everyone certainly understands that the reason why the Kuomintang government is willing to sell out the motherland and sign this treaty with the United States is to exchange for capital to fight a large-scale civil war, maintain its dictatorial bloody rule, and maintain the interests of the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen. Before and after the signing of this treaty, the Kuomintang government has obtained US$4.5 billion in various loans. Under the continuing debt of selling their bodies and the oppression and devastation of Chinese and foreign reactionaries, the 450 million Chinese people will forever be reduced to slaves of American imperialism!

Everyone should understand what is the cause of the collusion between Chiang and the United States? Chiang Kai-shek cannot suppress the Chinese people's peaceful and democratic movement and launch a large-scale attack on the Liberated Areas without American help. American imperialists need Chiang Kai-shek as an internal accomplice to suppress the Chinese people's resistance in order to invade China and turn China into its colony. Therefore, they colluded with each other.

Everyone should understand that the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the help of the United States, have long been determined to fight a civil war. Last year, when they were not yet ready, the United States feigned mediation, actually covering up Chiang Kai-shek's preparations for war. They falsely signed the January 10th ceasefire agreement to paralyze the Chinese and foreign people, so they began to attack the Liberated Areas step by step before the ink was dry. For example, on January 13, when the ceasefire order took effect, they occupied Mengxian County in our region on the 14th, and then continuously occupied our villages and towns. On the one hand, they held the Political Consultative Conference, and on the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek issued the "Bandit Suppression Manual"; on the one hand, they held "peace talks," and on the other hand, they attacked the Liberated Areas. The "peace talks" were intermittent, and the fighting grew from small to large, from outside the pass to inside the pass. Facts over the past year have proved that every time Chiang and the United States talk about "ceasefire," there is a "fight" following behind. This proves that "peace talks" are precisely to deceive people in the event of military setbacks, in order to buy time to reorganize their forces and fight again. Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people and completely tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, convening a Kuomintang "National Assembly" monopolized by the Kuomintang. Not only the Kuomintang thugs designated by Chiang Kai-shek ten years ago, but even the traitors designated ten years ago, occupied the "seats" and usurped the name of "national representatives," creating a pseudo-"constitution" that consolidated the one-party dictatorship. Apart from being touted by their foreign masters and celebrating by fascist thugs, listen to the voices of people from all walks of life across the country and fair-minded public opinion at home and abroad. Who is not criticizing it? Who is not opposed to it?! Even newspapers that have always been pro-Chiang can hardly cover it up. The Chiang family, in order to persist in their dictatorial rule, selling out the country, engaging in diplomatic oppression, oppressing the people, and fighting a large-scale civil war, have become so unscrupulous! They are abandoning themselves to the people, following the old tricks of Yuan Shikai and Cao Kun. Facts over the past year have told us that Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war will not repent on its own, but will become more and more fierce. Only the victory of the people's patriotic self-defense war can win China's independence, democracy, and peace.

The movement of the broad masses of the Chinese people to strive for independence, peace, and democracy is widespread and surging. The patriotic student movement that swept across the country is sympathized with by the people at home and abroad. This movement is not only protesting the incident of American soldiers raping Chinese female college students, but also shouting slogans such as "American troops immediately withdraw from China," "Oppose selling out diplomacy, oppose civil war," and "Oppose the pseudo-constitution, demand democracy." It is a great movement of the entire Chinese people against Chiang Kai-shek's policies of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war. Combined with the victorious patriotic self-defense war of the people in the Liberated Areas, the traitors will suffer the same fate as Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei.

Compatriots! We fought for eight years in the War of Resistance, shedding blood and sacrificing, first and foremost to strive for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation! The old hatred has just passed, and the new pain has come again; November 4th is our new National Humiliation Memorial Day! We will never be slaves again, and we have the power to wipe out the national humiliation. Carry forward the spirit of heroic struggle in the eight-year War of Resistance, continue the victorious struggle of the patriotic self-defense war, make persistent efforts, and wipe out the new national humiliation! To this end, everyone must cherish their own soldiers and more enthusiastically participate in their own soldiers. Treat the families of martyrs, military personnel, and honorably discharged soldiers with even greater care. Thoroughly implement the policy of land to the tiller and develop the large-scale production movement, in order to further strengthen our patriotic self-defense forces, seize the opportunity, and bring out all our strength to support the front lines. All work must be aimed at winning a comprehensive victory in the patriotic self-defense war, wiping out the new national humiliation, and realizing an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China!

Long live the victory of the patriotic self-defense war!
Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!
Long live the independent, peaceful, and democratic new China!

    晋冀鲁豫边区政府为拥护中共中央二月一日声明
    反对蒋美商约及反对伪宪告全区同胞书全边区父老兄弟姊妹们：
    去年十一月四日蒋介石和美国订立了一个“中美友好通商航海条约”，把中国卖得干干净净。这是中国的奇耻大辱！本府特依据全区人民的意志，定这一天为国耻纪念日。规定每年十一月四日举行纪念会，并下半旗一日，以示沉痛的纪念。
    全国人民艰苦抗战八年，打走了日本帝国主义，废除了不平等条约；但蒋介石却又引来一个美帝国主义者，允许它干涉中国内政，允许其海陆空军驻扎和活动于中国领海领土领空，许其占领或使用我国国防边塞和军事基地，许其参加我国军事组织和训练，这是出卖中国的军事和国防。嗣于陆续零星出卖各种主权换取打内战的军事经济帮助之后，又给中国人民出了这样一个总的卖身文契，置我全国人民于美国帝国主义奴隶的境地。
    大家对这个条约危害我国家民族的严重性，应有足够的认识。这个条约把美帝国主义者当成中国的主人，中国人不能享受的权利，美国人在中国却能享受，国民党政府还要特别帮助他们，保护他们。按照这个条约的内容，只要有美国政府的文件，美国人在中国可以置房买地、经营商业与兴办工厂；美国飞机可以在中国随便飞行；美国轮船可以在中国随便航行；美国人可以在中国随意开矿；美国人可以享受到中国人所不能享受到的各种自由。总之，中国成了美国帝国主义的中国！当初袁世凯卖国还有所顾忌，现在蒋介石卖国则是毫无忌惮，十分彻底，为袁世凯之所不敢为。蒋介石代替了汪精卫，美国代替了日本。而奸猾欺骗无耻则又过之。汪精卫以“曲线救国”解释其出卖民族国家当汉奸走狗，而蒋介石之卖国则居然装成“五强之一”以“平等互惠”来欺骗国人。谁都知道今天中国绝没有力量与美国在经济上讲“平等互惠”，中国人本身尚货弃于地，欲求苟延残喘而不可能，那有力量到美国去办工厂、开矿山、修铁路？那有飞机轮船到美国去航行做生意？更那有工业生产和美国业商品竞争？！蒋介石之所谓“平等互惠”不过是只“惠”了美国，将中国经济命脉奉送给美国，使中国变为美国的殖民地而已。事实不正是这样吗？一年以来，除解放区外，美国货已淹没了整个国民党区的市场。国民党统治区的工业破产，国货商店倒闭，工人店员失业，农民饥饿流离，不正是这个“平等互惠”的结果吗？难道说蒋介石及其反动党徒是傻子不了解这个道理与事实而上了美国的当吗？不是！这正是蒋美勾结巧计：一方面甘心出卖，一方面醉心侵略，而以“平等互惠”作掩护，企图用以欺骗国人及遮掩世界人士耳目而已。计毒心狠莫过于此！但一手难掩天下耳目，商约刚签订而举国舆论大哗，反对之声四起，即国外公平人士亦群起评论为中国前途担心！解放区人民尤感痛愤，誓死坚决反对，非达到取消它不止，本年二月一日中国共产党中央委员会所发表之郑重声明：“对于一九四六年一月十日以后由国民党政府单独成立的一切对外借款、一切丧权辱国条约，及一切其它上述的协定、谅解，与今后未经政治协商会议通过或未经征得本党和其他参加政治协商会议各党派同意的一切同类外交谈判，本党在现在和将来均不承认，并决不担负任何义务。”是代表全中国人民利益的庄严声明，正符合于我全区同胞之要求与意志。本府委员会特代表全区人民电陈延安，表明坚决拥护，并以实际力量求其贯彻。
    大家当然了解：国民党政府之所以甘心出卖祖国与美国签订这个条约，在于换取大打内战的本钱，维持其独裁的血腥统治与保持蒋宋孔陈四大家族的利益。签订这个条约的前后，国民党政府已得了四十五万万美金的各种各样借款，中国四万万五千万人民，在继续不已的卖身债与中外反动派压榨摧残之下，将永沦为美帝国主义之奴隶！
    大家应该了解蒋美勾结的因缘是什么？蒋介石为了镇压中国人民和平民主运动及大举进攻解放区，没有美国帮助不行，美帝国主义者要侵略中国把中国作成它的殖民地亦需要蒋介石作内应来镇压中国人民的反抗；所以他们心心相印的勾结起来。
    大家应该了解：国民党反动派在美国帮助之下，是早具内战决心的。去年在他们还没有准备好的时候，美国装模作样出面调停，实为掩护蒋介石进行备战工作。假意签字一月十日停战协定以麻痹中外人民，所以在墨迹未干的时候，即开始步步向解放区进攻。例如一月十三日停战令生效，十四日就占领了本区孟县城，以后复接连不断的侵占我们的村镇。一方面举行政协会议，一方面蒋介石颁发“剿共手册”；一方面举行“和谈”，一方面进攻解放区。“和谈”若断若续，打则由小而大，由关外打到关内。一年来的事实证明：蒋美每次谈“停战”，后面都是跟着一个“打”。这证明“和谈”正是为了军事失利时欺骗一下，以争取时间整备兵力再打。蒋介石更背弃人民，完全撕毁政协决议，召开一党包办的蒋记“国民大会”，不仅十年前蒋介石指定之党徒，甚至十年前所指定的汉奸都高踞“议席”篡窃“国民代表”名义，制造巩固一党独裁的伪“宪法”。除其外国主子代为吹嘘，法西斯党徒弹冠相庆外，试听全国各阶层人民呼声，及中外公正舆论，那个不在抨击，那个不在反对？！连夙称亲蒋的报纸都难以为之讳饰了。蒋氏家族为坚持其独裁统治卖国外交压榨人民大打内战，竟肆无忌惮至于此极！是自绝于国人，师袁世凯曹锟之故技。一年来的事实告诉我们，蒋介石决心卖国独裁内战的政策，不会自行悔改，而是越来越凶。只有人民爱国自卫战争的胜利，才能争到中国独立民主与和平。
    中国广大人民争取独立和平与民主的运动广泛的汹涌的起来了，普遍全国的学生爱国运动为中外人民所同情，这个运动不仅仅是抗议美军强奸中国女大学生事件，而是喊出了“美军立即全部撤出中国”，“反对卖国外交反对内战”，“反对伪宪要求民主”等口号，是一个全中国人民伟大的反蒋介石卖国独裁内战政策的运动。结合着解放区人民胜利的爱国自卫战争，卖国贼将遭到与袁世凯汪精卫同样的命运。
    同胞们！我们抗战八年流血牺牲，首先是为了争取中华民族的独立与自由！旧恨刚去，新痛又来了；十一月四日是我们新的国耻纪念日！我们永不再当奴隶，我们有力量洗雪国耻。发扬八年抗战英勇奋斗的精神，继续爱国自卫战争的胜利斗争，再接再厉，洗雪新国耻！为此，大家必须爱护自己的子弟兵更踊跃的参加自己子弟兵。更加意的优待烈属军属荣退军人。彻底贯彻耕者有其田与开展大生产运动，以求更充实我们爱国自卫力量，抓紧时机，拿出一切力量来支援前线，一切工作要为着争取爱国自卫战争的全面胜利，洗掉新国耻，实现独立和平民主的新中国！
    爱国自卫战争胜利万岁！
    中华民族解放万岁！
    独立和和平民主的新中国万岁！
