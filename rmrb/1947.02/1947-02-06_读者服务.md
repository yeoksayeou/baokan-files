    Wolves eating people is scary, but superstition is even scarier! Introducing a story about breaking superstition. Comrade Editor:
    On December 28th last year, I stayed overnight in Haojiapo, Fourth District of Xiangyuan, and listened to the villagers talk about many absurd and ridiculous stories: Once, a wolf came to a village sheepfold to eat sheep, and the militiamen fired a gun at the wolf, but no matter what, they couldn't pull the trigger. In × village, a wolf dragged away a child, and more than a day later, they found him at the foot of a wall. Everyone said that the mountain god had locked the wolf's mouth…
    I think: Wolves eating people is scary, but superstition is even scarier!
    In the peasant emancipation movement, illegal and evil landlords, in order to maintain their sinful rule, used endless conspiracies and tricks, even resorting to ghosts and gods, using the peasants' superstitious ideas, that is, making trouble with gods and ghosts, trying to scare the peasants who rose up to fight. Some places have already been fooled, but there are also good examples of smashing the landlords' "superstition plan." Below, I would like to tell such a story:
    Li Baohai, the emancipation hero of Taihang Heshun, had his younger brother bitten by a wolf one day.
    It was during those days that Li Baohai was going to lead everyone to emancipation, and no one dared to say anything against him. People were spreading rumors saying, "Baohai is making trouble with emancipation, and the mountain god bit his brother. Whoever makes trouble with emancipation will not be able to keep his life!" Baohai was in a hurry and had no way to get everyone to offer opinions and carry out emancipation? The knot couldn't be untied. Before the bitten person had recovered, a wolf bit another child. The family that was bitten had not offered any opinions or carried out emancipation. Baohai had an idea. He swore to the masses, "You say the mountain god is scary, the mountain god is effective, I will try it with him. Tomorrow I will go to the mountain and kick down the mountain god temple and the mountain god. If I die in three days, then everyone doesn't need to offer opinions, and there's no need for emancipation. If I'm still alive after three days, it will prove that there is no god, and we will all follow me!" The masses agreed. The next day, the mountain god temple was destroyed by Li Baohai.
    Three days, four days… passed, and Baohai was still fine. He said to everyone, "Is it clear now? The families that didn't make trouble with emancipation also had their children bitten by wolves. The temple was also knocked down, and I am still living well! Where did the god go?! After that, the masses rose up and showed no mercy to wolves, landlords, and bullies, and everyone was emancipated.

    Prohibit disguised gambling and develop cultural and recreational activities. Comrade Editor:
    During the New Year, there are still gambling phenomena in some places. For example, a group of young people in Suobao Town, She County, bought cigarettes and used copper coins on the street to gamble for cigarettes (the same as gambling for money in the past). Such disguised gambling should be prohibited in a timely manner.
    During this army-loving month, it is best to organize these people into cultural and recreational activities. For example, in Zuoquan recently, many villages and towns,

    狼吃人可怕，迷信更可怕！介绍一个打破迷信的故事编辑同志：
    去年十二月二十八日，我夜宿在襄垣四区郝家坡，听着老乡谈了很多荒谬滑稽的故事：有次狼到村里羊圈吃羊，民兵开枪打狼，可是无论如何也拉不开拴。×村狼拖走了一个小孩，隔了一天多，又在一个地墙跟下寻着了，大家都说，山神爷锁了狼的嘴了，……
    我想：狼吃人可怕，迷信更可怕！
    在农民翻身运动中，非法恶霸地主们，为了保持他们罪恶的统治，阴谋诡计，层出不穷，甚至有借助于鬼神的，利用农民的迷信思想，即闹神闹鬼，企图吓倒起来斗争的农民。有的地方已上了当，但也有粉碎地主“迷信计”的好例子，下面我愿讲个这样的故事：
    太行和顺翻身英雄李保孩的弟弟，一天被狼咬了一下。
    正是那几天李保孩要领导大家翻身，说长道短谁也不敢干。人们乱传着说：“保孩闹翻身，山神爷把他兄弟咬了一口，谁要闹翻身，谁的命就保不住呀！”保孩干急没办法，怎么叫大家提意见搞翻身呀？老解不开这个圪瘩。被咬着的这人还没好了，狼又咬了一个孩子。被咬这一家是没有提过意见搞过翻身的，保孩有了主意了，他向群众宣誓说：“你们说出神爷可怕，山神爷灵，我就和他试一试，明天我就到山上把那山神庙、山神爷踢踏掉，三天以后我要死了，大家就不用提意见了，也不用翻身了。三天以后我还活着，就证明没神，咱大家就跟我干啊！”群众应承下了。第二天山神庙就被李保孩打垮了。
    又是三天、四天………了，保孩还好好的。他向大家说：“清楚了吧？不闹翻身的人家狼也咬了小孩。把庙也打倒了，我还活的好生生哩！神那里去了？！此后群众起来了，对狼、对地主、恶霸没有留情，大家才翻了身。

    禁止变相赌博开展文化娱乐运动编辑同志：
    在新年中，有些地方还有赌博现象。如涉县索堡镇一伙青年人买上纸烟，在街上用铜钱板码（和过去赌钱一样），输赢纸烟，这样的变相赌博，应及时禁止。
    在这个拥爱月中，最好把这些人组织到文化娱乐里边去，如左权近来有不少村镇为了配合拥军优抗工作，加强群众宣传教育，他们正积极组织文化娱乐工作，有的排演新剧，有的闹花戏和扭秧歌等，这种做法，大家可以学习。
