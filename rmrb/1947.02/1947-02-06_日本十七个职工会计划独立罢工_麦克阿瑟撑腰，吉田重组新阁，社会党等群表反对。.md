Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Tokyo dispatch: Seventeen trade unions are still planning "independent strikes." According to a United Press reporter, if these "independent strikes" break out one after another, their scale will be no less than a general strike. The trade unions are awaiting the government's response to their demands. In recent days, the Central Labor Relations Board has been trying to get the government and the trade unions to reach a compromise, but so far, no results have been achieved. If this negotiation breaks down, "independent strikes" will begin one after another. The railway freight car workers' union, affiliated with the Transportation Workers' Union, originally planned to start a strike on the 1st, but it has been postponed because it is negotiating with the government. On the 2nd, the National Railway Workers' Union, representing its 580,000 members, submitted a petition to the Allied Council for Japan through the Allied Far Eastern Commission, requesting the dispatch of a delegation to investigate the actual situation in Japan and demanding the abolition of MacArthur's ban.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Tokyo dispatch: With the support of MacArthur and the big Japanese Zaibatsu, Yoshida has brazenly reorganized his cabinet regardless of everything. In the new cabinet, Yoshida's Liberal Party controls the overall situation, accounting for six seats. Yoshida, in his capacity as Prime Minister, concurrently serves as Foreign Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The notorious Ishibashi not only serves as Minister of Finance but also as Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. There are also two ministers without portfolio and one Minister of Home Affairs. Shidehara's Progressive Party only obtained four seats in the new cabinet, and other non-partisan members have three seats. The ministers of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, as well as the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, were dismissed during the reorganization.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Tokyo dispatch: The formation of Yoshida's new cabinet has aroused widespread opposition. The Asahi Shimbun stated: The newly formed cabinet should resign and be replaced by a completely new cabinet. On the 2nd, the Socialist Party issued a statement again demanding Yoshida's complete resignation to apologize to the Allied Powers and all the Japanese people.

    日本十七个职工会计划独立罢工
    麦克阿瑟撑腰，吉田重组新阁，社会党等群表反对。
    【新华社延安四日电】东京讯：现有十七个职工会仍着着计划“独立罢工”。据合众社记者称：一旦此等“独立罢工”相继爆发，则其规模实不亚于总同盟罢工。各工会正等待政府方面，对其要求的答复。连日来中央劳工关系局，力图使政府方面与职工会达成妥协，但迄未获任何结果。如果此次谈判破裂，则“独立罢工”将一个接一个的开始。交通工人工会所属铁路货车工人工会，原定一日开始罢工，现因正与政府进行交涉而延期。国营铁路工人工会于二日代表其五十八万会员，经盟国对日委员会向盟国远东委员会提出请愿书，要求派遣代表团来调查日本实况，及要求取消麦氏禁令。
    【新华社延安二日电】东京讯：由于麦克阿瑟及日本大财阀的支持，吉田已悍然不顾一切的自行改组其内阁，新阁中吉田之自由党控制全局，共估六席，吉田以首相身位兼任外相及农林相，臭名昭彰之石桥不仅任藏相，且兼任经济平准局长，尚有两位无任所大臣及一位内相。币原之进步党在新阁中仅获四席，其他无党派者三席。改组中撤职者为内务省、文部省、工商省及农林省诸大臣及经济平准局局长。
    【新华社延安四日电】东京讯：吉田新阁组成后，已引起广泛之反对。朝日新闻称：新组成之内阁应当辞职，以全新的内阁来代替。社会党于二日发表声明，再次要求吉田总辞职以向同盟国及全日本人民谢罪。
