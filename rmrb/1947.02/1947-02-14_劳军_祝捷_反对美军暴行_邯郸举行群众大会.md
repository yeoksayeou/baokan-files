    Comforting Troops, Celebrating Victory, Opposing U.S. Military Atrocities
    邯郸 Holds Mass Rally
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the 5th of this month, representatives of various agencies in邯郸 City and more than 20,000 citizens from various streets and villages held a mass rally at the public sports ground to comfort the troops, celebrate victory, and oppose U.S. military atrocities. Comrade冯洋舟, deputy director of the Municipal National Salvation Association, first reported the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army in January, pointing out that the atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Beiping were a great insult to the Chinese people. Before he could finish speaking, the masses immediately roared, "U.S. troops get out of China!" Then Mayor Wang spoke, calling on everyone to unite and support the patriotic self-defense war in order to oppose the U.S. military atrocities and crush the attacks of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. More than 20,000 people presented many gifts and comfort bags on the spot, and passed a telegram to the Beiping Students Anti-Atrocity Federation. Afterwards, a demonstration parade stretching three or four *li* long unfolded, and earth-shaking roars reverberated throughout 邯郸 City: "Armymen and civilians unite!" "Smash the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's attack!" "U.S. troops get out of China!" (Xiao Fang)
