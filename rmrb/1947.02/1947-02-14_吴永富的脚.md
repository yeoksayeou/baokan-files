	Wu Yongfu's Foot
	Hu Qi
	In the winter of 1940, the Japanese devils were "mopping up" the second sub-district of Taihang. One of our machine gun squad leaders was wounded by a shell and fell into a deep snowy mountain gully. He regained consciousness in the hospital and saw that only half of one of his feet remained. Soon the wound healed, and he asked to return to the front lines. Someone suggested to him: "Your foot is no good anymore, stay in the rear and be a communications squad leader." He resolutely replied: "A bad foot won't defeat me. I can still carry a machine gun at the front."
	In 1942, during the streamlining of troops and administration, they sought his opinion: "Comrade, the struggle is becoming increasingly brutal, and your body may not be able to take it..." Before the higher-ups could finish speaking, he shouted: "If others can take it, so can I." He quietly made a pair of thick-soled shoes, stuffed them with old cotton, and found a square piece of cloth to wrap his crippled foot. He began to train in silence.
	This machine gun squad leader is today's Second Company Commander Wu Yongfu. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese devils ruined one of his feet. In the Self-Defense War, Chiang Kai-shek's army didn't even touch one of his toes. He has become the most outstanding hero of the Yangzhuang battle in Yutai.

    吴永富的脚
    胡奇
    一九四○年冬天，日寇“扫荡”太行二分区，我们一位机枪班长被炮弹打伤，跌在深雪的山沟里，他在医院里清醒过来，看见自己一只脚上只丢下了一半，不久伤口长好了，他就要求回前方去，有人给他提意见：“你的脚不行了，留在后方当通讯班长吧。”他坚决的回答：“脚坏了难不倒我，我到前方一样扛得动机枪。”
    四二年精兵简政，征求他的意见：“同志，斗争越来越残酷，你身体怕熬不住……。”他没等上级说完，就大叫大嚷起来：“怕熬不住呢，别人能熬得住，我也能熬得住。”他悄悄的做了只厚底鞋，塞了些旧棉花，找了块方布，把残废的脚一包，一个人不啃不响的锻炼起来。
    这位机枪班长就是今天的二连连长吴永富，抗战中日寇打坏了他的一只脚，自卫战争中蒋介石军连他一根脚趾头也没动到，他已成为鱼台杨庄之战最出色的英雄。
