    The Growth of "Frontline News"
    Tian Xiao
    During the Lin Nan Campaign in 1943, which aimed to suppress the puppet troops of Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, a Women's Rescue Association chairperson was delivering food to the front lines. Comrade Lu Yu wrote about this incident on a mimeograph stencil for distribution to the companies. After reading it in the trenches, a platoon leader was so moved that he shed tears. As a result, Comrade Lu Yu decided to start publishing "Frontline News" using mimeograph stencils.

    During the Shangdang Campaign, Platoon Leader Peng Huaijing was wounded in the head. Many people urged him to go to the hospital, but he insisted on staying and took charge of carrying backpacks with colored flags. After the battle, Comrade Lu Yu encountered him still working with the team and was deeply moved: "What is their attitude towards the revolution? What exactly have we, who wield pens, contributed to the revolution? This person should be commended." Battalion Commander Ma Guoliang, wounded, said to Comrade Lu Yu: "This time, you must publish something about Zhang Caihong from our battalion." He had thrown twelve hand grenades on his own. So Comrade Lu Yu mimeographed a few more issues of "Frontline News."

    During the Ping-Han Campaign, publication was suspended for a long time due to material difficulties. However, Deputy Political Commissar He resolutely advocated resuming publication and even convened a special meeting, stipulating that the task of the newspaper was to: "Praise model individuals, criticize bad behavior, and educate ourselves using our own affairs." One issue was published daily during marches and battles, and one issue every three days during training. A sum of money was taken from living expenses to solve the funding problem, and the newspaper switched from mimeograph to stencil printing.

    During each long march, when the camp was set up for the night, a large pile of manuscripts would be sent in from below, all about the good and bad examples from the day's march.

    The newspaper was often written and stenciled at night. Once, Comrade Lu Yu was so tired that he dozed off at night, causing the oil lamp to burn away half of the wax paper. However, the next day, he still printed the remaining half.

    The praise and criticism in the newspaper played a significant role. Dong Ruiyi was a captured soldier from the Ping-Han Campaign who usually behaved very poorly. After being praised just once, he transformed into an active member during marches, carrying two guns and eight bombs for others.

    During the battles to annihilate the 3rd Reorganized Division and Longfeng, "Frontline News" was published right on the front lines. The soldiers' reactions were: "You just finish fighting here, and it's already published there." "The more we crawl in the trenches, the clearer our minds become, and the more we enjoy listening to the news."

    After the newspaper received an award from Yan'an Radio, Comrade Lu Yu, the head of the propaganda and education section, became even more confident in running the newspaper. He gave the bonus from the higher authorities to the contributors. Carrying the steel plate, wax paper, ink, and roller on his back, he conducted interviews himself, edited the newspaper himself, and sometimes even stenciled and printed it himself. He selected稿s and stenciled the newspaper simultaneously, so the newspaper was published even faster. On the night of entering the battle of Shaoerzhai, the march lasted until twelve o'clock, but the next morning, "Frontline News" was already out, with articles about the previous night's march. On the second day after the troops entered Shaoerzhai, the news that "the Seventh Platoon of the Ninth Company captured a cannon" was also published in the Frontline News. I went to see the digging of fortifications, and a soldier holding a copy of "Frontline News" said to me: "Look, what's up with our Eighth Company?" "Can you read?" "No." "Then how do you know there's something about the Eighth Company?" "I only recognize the character 'eight,' and I think it's probably about our Eighth Company." I turned to the Ninth Company soldier: "Did you see yesterday's newspaper?" "I have a copy in my pocket." A soldier who was digging fortifications said as he pulled out a copy of "Frontline News"........

    “火线报”的生长
    天晓
    一九四三年讨伐伪军庞炳勋和孙殿英的林南战役中，有个妇救主席往火线上送饭，鲁鱼同志把这件事用复写纸写给各连。一位排长在战壕里读了之后，感动得流了泪，于是鲁鱼同志就决定用复写纸出“火线报”。
    上党战役中，排长彭怀井头部挂彩，好多人劝他去住医院，他坚持不去，并且负责给彩号运背包。作战完毕，鲁鱼同志碰见他还在随队工作，很受感动：“人家对革命是什么态度，咱们拿笔杆子的对革命到底贡献了什么？这个人应该好好表扬。”营长马国良负伤下来对鲁鱼同志说：“这一回可要给咱营张彩红登个报”。他一个人打了十二个手榴弹。于是鲁鱼同志又复写了几期“火线报”。
    平汉战役中，因为物质困难，很久没有出。但何副政委坚决主张恢复出报，并特别召开了个会，规定报纸的任务是：“表扬模范，批评坏的，用部队自己的事教育自己。”行军作战时一天出一期，整训时三天出一期。从生活费中拿了一笔钱解决经费问题，报纸由复写改为油印。
    每次长行军中，一宿下营时，下边就送来了一大把稿子。尽是当天行军中好的和坏的例子。
    报纸常常在晚上刻写，有一次鲁鱼同志过于疲劳，夜晚打磕睡，让油灯把腊纸烧掉一半，但第二天也还是把未烧掉的半张印了出来。
    报纸的表扬和批评起了很大的作用，董瑞一是平汉战役解放过来的，平时表现得很糟糕，只表扬了一次，就变成行军中的积极分子，他替别人背两杆枪、八个炸弹。
    消灭整三师和龙凤之战中，“火线报”就在火线上出版。战士们的反映是：“你这里一打完仗，他那里就登出来了。”“越是在战壕里爬着，脑袋里越清闲，越喜欢听个报。”
    报纸受到延安广播奖励之后，宣教股长鲁鱼同志办报的信心更高了。他把上级给的奖金给了投稿的人。自己背着钢板、腊纸、油墨、和滚子，自己采访，自己编报，有时还自己刻自己印，一边选稿、一边刻报，因此报就出得更快了。进入邵耳寨战斗的晚间，行军直到十二点，可是第二天一大早，“火线报”就出来了，上边登着昨晚行军的稿子。部队进入邵耳寨的第二天，“九连七班得了一门炮”的消息就在火线报上也登出来了。我去看挖工事，一个战士拿着一张“火线报”对我说：“你看我们八连是什么事？”“你认得字吗？”“不认得。”“那你怎么知道上边有八连的事呢？”“我光认得个‘八’字，我想大概是咱八连的事吧。”我转向九连战士：“看见昨天的报没有？”“我口袋里装有一张哩。”一位正在挖工事的战士边说边掏出一张“火线报”来…………。
