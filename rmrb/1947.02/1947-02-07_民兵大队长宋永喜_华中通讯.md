    Militia Battalion Commander Song Yongxi
    Central China Correspondence
    Song Yongxi, the militia battalion commander of a certain village beside the Thirty Mile River near the Chiang-controlled stronghold of ×× Town in a certain area of Central Jiangsu, always crosses the thirty-mile-long riverbank once or twice a day. The people say, "Battalion Commander Song really travels thirty miles every day." So everyone gave him the nickname "Thirty Mile." When he passes by the entrance of each house, the people always say affectionately, "Thirty Mile is here, now we can rest assured." After he helped more than eighty military families in the whole village solve the problems of land distribution and cultivation, they all said in unison, "Thirty Mile is like a key to our hearts. As soon as we see Thirty Mile, everything is solved." During the Ye Ting (Yancheng) Campaign, Song Yongxi mobilized forty-two stretchers through the wind and rain overnight. The masses concluded for him, "What others cannot accomplish, Thirty Mile can accomplish."
    After the Chiang troops occupied ×× Town, he was determined to persist in the struggle. Nine young men ran out and said, "We will follow Thirty Mile even if we die." The Chiang troops moved away his household belongings, attempting to threaten him, but he acted as if nothing had happened and said, "As long as we have people, who cares about furniture? When the counter-offensive comes, it will all be ours anyway!"
    On December 18th, the reporter encountered "Thirty Mile" in the ×× Village guerrilla team. He was of medium build, with full cheeks, and full of energy. He looked like a very simple and honest farmer. At that time, the troops were issuing a strange emergency order: "Comrade Song Yongxi is to immediately stop working and take time to rest." The team members gathered together and calculated that "Thirty Mile" had not closed his eyes for five days and nights. He had been busy fighting the enemy. On the very night he received the order to rest, as soon as he fell asleep, he suddenly thought of the military dependents' rations that needed to be handled, so he hurriedly left again. On another occasion, on a freezing night with the north wind howling, "Thirty Mile" escorted a certain unit to a large river. The situation was unclear, and there were no boats. Everyone felt it was difficult to advance or retreat. "Thirty Mile" resolutely took off his clothes and swam across the river, obtaining a boat. By the time everyone was safely ferried to the other side, he was completely frozen, but he still gritted his teeth and sent everyone to their destination. During the more than ten-mile march, he was barefoot, stumbling from the cold, and fell into the river bay three times. Some people who knew him were moved to tears and said, "'Thirty Mile,' didn't they tell you to rest? You've suffered enough." "Thirty Mile" replied with a smile, "For the sake of revolutionary work, it's a pleasure to suffer more." "Thirty Mile's" enthusiasm for work is not without reason, because he is a poor peasant who turned over during the land reform. In order to protect the land and his home, he fights the enemy day and night. The people on the Thirty Mile River live by the Thirty Mile River. They watch the river flowing continuously and watch "Thirty Mile" fighting non-stop, and they say with a double meaning: "With Thirty Mile here, we are here."

    民兵大队长宋永喜
    华中通讯
    坚持在苏中某地蒋据点××镇旁三十里河边的××乡民兵大队长宋永喜，每天总要在三十里长的河边上过一两次，老百姓说：“宋大队长真是每日三十里。”于是大家就给他取了一个名字叫三十里。当他走过每家路口时，老百姓总是亲热的说：“卅里来了，我们可安心了。”全乡八十多家军属在他帮助下解决了分田与耕种后，异口同声地说：“三十里是我们心上的一把钥匙，一见三十里万事就解决。”叶挺（盐城）战役中，宋永喜连夜冒风雨动员了四十二付担架。群众替他下了结论：“谁不能完成的任务，三十里能完成。”
    蒋军占领了××镇后，他就决心坚持斗争。有九个青年跑出来说：“我们死也跟三十里走。”蒋军搬走了他家里用具，企图以此威胁他，但他却置若无事地说：“只要留得人在，那怕没得家具。反攻一到，还不都是我们的！”
    十二月十八日，记者在××乡游击队碰到了“三十里”，中等身材，脸颊丰满，精神抖擞，看上去就知道是一个很朴实的农民，那时部队里正下着一个奇怪的紧急命令：“宋永喜同志立即停止工作，争取时间休息”队员们拥在一起屈指计算，“卅里”已有五昼夜没有合眼了，他一直在忙着对敌斗争。就在他接到休息命令的当天晚上，他刚一睡下，忽然想起了军属粮草要处理，于是又匆匆地走了。另一次在严寒的夜里，北风呼啸着，“三十里”护送某部转移到一条大河边，情况不清，又无船只，大家都感到进退两难。“三十里”决不迟疑的脱下衣服游过了大河，得到了船，当把所有人安渡到对岸时，他混身已经冻僵了，但他还是咬紧牙关，把大家送到目的地。在十多里的行军中，他光着脚，冻得跌跌撞撞，曾三次跌下河湾，有些认识他的人感动得流泪说：“‘三十里’上面不是叫你休息吗，你够苦了。”“三十里”却笑着回答：“为了革命工作，多吃些苦倒是痛快的。”“三十里”工作的积极是有原因的，因为他是一个贫农，土地改革中他翻了身，为了保田保家，他不分日夜在同敌人斗争着，三十里河边的人们，是靠三十里河吃饭的，他们看着河水川流不息，看着“三十里”斗争不停，就一语两关的说：“有三十里在，就有我们。”
