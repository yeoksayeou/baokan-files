Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Shanghai dispatch: The Wenhui Bao here published a Taiwan correspondence on the 14th of last month, summarizing the one year of Chiang government rule in Taiwan. The correspondence stated: The industrial production in Taiwan is largely in a state of shutdown. According to figures released by the authorities, the important industrial product of sugar cane only produced 80,000 tons last year, less than one-sixteenth of its peak period. The special product camphor manufacturing industry has been completely shut down. Rice prices have also soared, increasing to more than 70,000 yuan per dan in legal tender compared to last year, and there is still no supply at that price. Taiwan's public opinion points out that this is the result of the Chiang government transporting most of Taiwan's grain to other places for military rations. The people are suffering from hunger and cold, and robbery cases are endless. Those who are forced to take risks have posted slogans such as "Officials skim the oil, we rob." The people of Taiwan feel extremely grief-stricken and disappointed with the rule of the Chiang government. They say: "These officials have come to Taiwan to make a fortune," and they have demanded the popular election of county and city mayors to implement local autonomy.

    台湾工业大部停顿
    【新华社延安十一日电】上海讯：上月十四日此间文汇报台湾通讯：对蒋政府统治台湾一年作了总结。该通讯称：台湾工业生产已大部在停工状态中，其工业重要产品蔗糖据当局发表数字，去年仅产八万吨，不及全盛时期的十六分之一。特产樟脑制造业已全部停顿。米价飞涨也较去年增涨至每担法币七万余元，现仍有价无市。台省舆论指出，这是蒋政府将台省米粮大部分运往他地充作军粮的结果，人民饥寒交迫，抢案层出不穷，被迫挺而走险者曾高贴“官揩油我们抢”的标语，台湾人民对于蒋政府统治已感到极度悲愤失望，他们说：“这批官吏是到台湾来发财的”，并纷纷要求民选县市长实行地方自治。
