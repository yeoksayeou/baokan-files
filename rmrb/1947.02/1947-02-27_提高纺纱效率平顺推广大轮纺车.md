　　(This newspaper, Taihang, 24th) In order to complete the hundred-day spinning and weaving plan, Pingshun County is promoting the "Yan'an-style" big-wheel spinning wheel and hand-pulled shuttle loom on a large scale to improve tools. The county plans to promote 5,328 big-wheel spinning wheels, requiring at least ten in each village, and to create big-wheel spinning wheel groups or teams in villages with a foundation in spinning and weaving. The county plans to increase 480 hand-pulled looms. The tool factory of the county's cooperative has recently transferred 35 carpenters from various villages for short-term training and extensive manufacturing. The factory has also set a plan to complete 20 spinning machines, 50 hand-pulled shuttle looms, and 300 shuttles by the end of May. Note: The "Yan'an-style" big-wheel spinning wheel has a wheel diameter of 2.8 feet, a body length of 2.9 feet, a shaft length of 1 foot, and a thickness of 3.5 inches. The output can be increased by one time compared with the smaller spinning wheel.
