    Thoroughly Investigate Hidden Feudal Remnants
    Masses in Taihang Dig Air-Raid Shelters
    [This newspaper reported] During the in-depth land reform phase in Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng, Lingchuan, and other counties in Taihang, hidden landlords were investigated. The broad masses of backward peasants and women were mobilized to raise their awareness, draw class boundaries, resolutely separate from landlords, and actively expose and dig up the landlords’ "air-raid shelters," achieving great results. In Changzhi's Third District, self-reporting revealed over 6,600 mu of land, over 1,700 rooms, over 100 head of livestock, over 6,900 taels of silver ingots and jewelry, over 17,000 silver dollars, and over 7,900 pieces of clothing hidden for landlords. In Wangqing Village, Fifth District, twenty-five peasants reported concealing 71 mu of land, 82 shi of grain, and clothing, silver dollars, livestock, etc., for ten landlord households. In Lucheng's Fourth and Fifth Districts, over twenty peasant households painfully exposed the facts of being deceived and dug up the landlords' "air-raid shelters" during the in-depth grievance sessions for all peasants. Twelve women activists in Fucun exposed the landlords' hidden "reversal of fortunes ledgers," arousing mass hatred, tearing off the masks, and actively digging out "harboring," thoroughly defeating the big landlords Wang Baozheng and Wang Wenzheng. During the in-depth movement in Licheng, a movement to dig up "air-raid shelters" was universally launched in various villages. Meetings of landlord relatives were held among the masses to expose the landlords' conspiracies, proposing: "Resolutely separate from landlords." As the awareness of cadres and the masses increased, they also actively dug up "air-raid shelters." The "air-raid shelter" households in Nanweiquan actively reported hiding 13 mu of land, 98 silver dollars, over 2,000 jin of grain, and many other materials for twenty-one relatives and landlords of the same clan. Peasant ×× from Shanghuangtang reported hiding over 200 silver dollars and over 100 jin of cotton for relatives in other villages. The militia captain of Nanma Village in Lingchuan frankly said: "I was deceived and bought by the landlord Li Ruihe, acting as his "air-raid shelter" to hide his belongings and silver dollars. This is all the blood and sweat of us poor people! I resolutely take them out and let my poor brothers stand up." Under his influence, seventeen members of the masses also actively exposed "air-raid shelters" and thoroughly settled accounts with the landlords. (Lin)
