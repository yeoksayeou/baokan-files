    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th] The Eighth Route Army on the front lines of northern Henan carried out work to cherish the people amidst the artillery fire, celebrating the New Year together with the local people. More than ten villages near the Jiang army's Wulongmiao stronghold in Meng County, such as Zhangshe, Qili, Zhao Village, Xie Du, and Guo Zhuang, were usually disturbed, looted and robbed by the Jiang puppet army. Therefore, although they secretly bought some meat and vegetables and steamed some buns for the Lunar New Year, they were afraid that the Jiang army would come out to rob them, so they hid them in the haystacks, looking sad and dared not celebrate the New Year. The Eighth Route Army in northern Henan immediately sent a unit to shelter the local people to celebrate the New Year, and played Yangko stilt walkers to pay New Year's greetings to the people amidst the artillery fire. As a result, the dead villages immediately became alive. The people took out the meat, vegetables and steamed buns from the haystacks, and some even dressed in red and green. The Eighth Route Army took this opportunity to hold a meeting to explain major domestic events. The people were very happy. They said, "It is rare for the Eighth Route Army to come and protect us in such heavy snow so we can have a peaceful year. We will have a good time." Many people even brought meat and vegetables to comfort the Eighth Route Army, but they were politely declined. The army roasted and ate their own dry food on the fire. Grandma Zhu from Zhangshe Village persuaded the army to eat her food seven times, but the Eighth Route Army insisted on not accepting it. She said excitedly: "You are really a Bodhisattva army!" After speaking, she knelt down and kowtowed non-stop. The Eighth Route Army also organized the local people to establish joint village defense, so they can always have a peaceful life. More than 200 people who had been scared away before have returned one after another.
    [This newspaper] A Northern Henan Front reporter group reported: The Northern Henan Front troops launched a campaign to support the government and cherish the people during the break between battles. During the Lunar New Year, they conducted inspections of mass discipline, and apologized and compensated the government and the masses. Education and self-criticism on saving civilian manpower were also conducted. Units 203 and 205 also combined with the merit-making campaign to call on everyone to work hard to help the masses. During the Lunar New Year, the troops were mobilized to help the villagers who had no livestock to grind flour. The villagers were very happy and said, "You are good at fighting, and you are also energetic at grinding flour." In particular, the story of the Eighth Route Army risking their lives to rescue children has been widely spread among the people: On the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, Yuan Si's nine-year-old child, He Dong, the anti-Japanese director of Yihetou Village in Lin County, was knocked into a deep well of two or three feet by a sheep. The villagers were afraid to go down to fish him out. Miao Hongxi, clerk of the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion of the "Wutai" unit, and the correspondent Gao Changxiao, the health worker Zhou Miao, and soldiers Zuo Maosheng and Li Huangmao disregarded the cold and danger, went down the well to rescue the child and sent him home to warm up. The child's parents were very grateful and wanted to invite them to drink, but they all said, "This is our responsibility!"

    豫北前线我军掩护群众过年
    【本报太岳九日电】豫北前线八路军在炮火中进行爱民工作，与当地老百姓共同欢度新年。孟县蒋军乌龙庙据点附近之张舍、绮里、赵村、谢渎、郭庄等十余村，平日被蒋伪军扰乱抢劫，所以阴历年关虽也偷偷买些肉菜蒸些馍，但防卫蒋军出来抢，仍埋藏在草堆里，愁眉苦脸，不敢过年。豫北八路军随即派出一部队掩护当地老百姓欢度新年，并扮演秧歌高跷，在炮火中向老百姓拜年。于是死村子马上变成活村子，老百姓把肉菜蒸馍从草堆中拿出来，还有的穿红着绿。八路军乘此召开大会，讲解国内大事。老百姓都很高兴，他们说：“难得八路军这样大雪天还来掩护咱过个太平年，咱就好好过一下。”不少人更拿上肉菜来慰劳八路军，但都被婉言推谢了，军队在火堆上烤吃自己的干粮。张舍村朱老太太七次劝军队吃她的东西，但八路军坚持不收，她激动地说：“你们真是菩萨队伍！”说完就跪下叩头不止。八路军又组织当地老百姓，建立联村联防，永远过太平日子。以前被吓跑的二百多老百姓，都纷纷回来。
    【本报讯】豫北前线记者团报导：豫北前线部队在战斗间隙，开展了拥政爱民的活动，旧历新年进行了群众纪律的检查，向政府及群众进行道歉及赔偿。并进行了节约民力的教育及检讨。二○三、二○五部队并结合立功运动，号召努力帮助群众。旧历年关发动部队帮助没有牲口的老乡推磨，老乡们非常高兴的说：“你们打仗是好样，推磨也卖力气”。特别是八路军冒险抢救小孩的故事，在民间普遍传颂：大年初四，林县依河头村抗勤主任元四的九岁孩子和冬，被羊撞进一水深二三丈的深井，老乡们都不敢下去捞，“五台”部三营八连文书苗鸿喜，通讯员高长小，卫生员周苗、战士左茂生、李黄毛不顾寒冷和危险，下井救上小孩送回家去烤暖。小孩的爹娘非常感谢，要请他们喝酒，他们都说：“这是我们的责任！”
