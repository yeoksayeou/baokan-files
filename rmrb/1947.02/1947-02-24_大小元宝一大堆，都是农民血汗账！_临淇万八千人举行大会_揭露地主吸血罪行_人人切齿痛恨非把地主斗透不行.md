[This newspaper's] Lin County News: In order to promote the continued deepening of the land reform movement in the fourth and sixth districts of Lin County, and to enable peasants to thoroughly turn themselves around, a mass rally of 18,000 people was held in Linqi on the 7th and 8th of this month. The rally included an exhibition of struggle targets and the fruits of struggle, a collective denunciation of the monstrous crimes of the despotic landlords, and commendations for models who voluntarily reported hidden guns and property of landlords. The first day of the rally was a large exhibition. Eighteen thousand people gathered in Linqi town. The despotic landlords stood behind mountains of seized goods, confessing to the masses their history of oppressing and exploiting the peasants. Some landlords did not tell the truth and were immediately rebuked by the masses. An old white-haired woman followed behind a landlord, hitting him with a small stick while saying, "I want to vent all this grievance in my stomach!" Zhang Mingshan, a big landlord from Xize under the sixth district of Qidong, had a tall hat on which was written: "Zhang Mingshan is really ruthless in exploiting the poor, small measures out, big measures in." In front of him were placed large and small measuring containers. The tenants saw them and said, "Our roots of poverty are on these!" Zhang Mingshan used to own 2,500 mu of land. He handed over three hundred and forty large and small silver ingots, weighing a total of one hundred and thirty-five catties. Everyone pointed at the silver ingots and said, "Who of us has ever seen these silver ingots in our lives!" In addition, there were also thousands of silver dollars and all kinds of silk clothes and rotten wheat and millet. People looked at the grains that had become lumps and said angrily, "Look at how sinful the landlords are. We poor people, in famine years, fled famine and starved to death without even being able to eat grain!" An old man in his seventies or eighties from Guanyinmiao Village in the fourth district told everyone he met, "Attending this rally is the happiest thing in my life. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, who would be able to attend such a big rally!" The second day of the rally was a large-scale denunciation of the despotic landlords. Shen, the district head of Qidong Sixth District, repeatedly stated that the government would definitely stand up for the masses, and hoped that the elders and brothers who had not yet thoroughly turned themselves around could pour out all the bitterness in their stomachs. Xue Wengui from Niujiagang Village was the first to say, "My family has farmed land for Liu Xiaowu for three generations. Not to mention all the official labor (serving the landlord), my mother had to grind grain for his family, six stones a day, grinding five and a half dou out of six. He said she hadn't ground six dou, beat my mother and drove her out. This made it impossible for my family to flee to Shanxi, and three people starved to death." Yan Xiuhua continued, "I was sold to Yan Zhenquan's family as a maid when I was nine years old. He smoked opium day and night, and asked me to serve him, not being able to sleep all night. If I dozed off, they would beat me. There was a seven-year-old maid with me. His family's child fell and blamed the maid, pushing her off the cliff and killing her!" Many women shed tears as they listened. Yan Cuiying cried and complained, "I was also a maid at Yan Duobing's house when I was eight years old, and I didn't leave his house until I was fifteen. For seven or eight years, I had to carry a chamber pot for him every night, four or five times a night. Sometimes when I fell asleep, and missed something, they would take off my clothes and beat me hard with a big stick, sometimes making me kneel in the courtyard for half the night!" Zhong Youqing from Zhaoyangcheng Village continued, "My family used to farm land for Yishengtang for six generations, and we performed a lot of official labor. When his family built a house, we helped him for years. When the house was built, he wouldn't let me farm anymore! I had no choice but to flee to Shanxi, and two people starved to death." Before he finished speaking, Li Dianyuan from Jinggou Village rushed to say, "Let me also complain about all the bitterness in my stomach! I originally reclaimed wasteland in Wuximingpo, and it was agreed that no matter how much I reclaimed, I would pay one stone of rent every year, and the trees I grew would be split in half. So I worked harder to reclaim it. That year, the harvest was bad, and there was no grain in the field. He took all the grain away, and we didn't even have a handful of chaff left! We had to borrow some chaff from neighbors, and if we weren't full, we ate white soil and tree leaves. My three children starved to death that year." He cried as he said, "After reclaiming the land for ten years, the landlord saw that the trees had grown up, and he took all the trees away. We suffered a loss, but we didn't dare to say anything. And that's not all, when I reclaimed forty mu of land, he wanted to exchange it for Wu Jin's family's flat land, and took all my land away. I've been reclaiming land for more than twenty years, and it's like I've been working for him for nothing. When I think about it, I've really suffered all the hardships in the world in my life! Today I must overthrow the landlord completely and make him suffer too!" The people who had been oppressed and exploited by the landlords continued to complain, one after another, their sufferings seemingly endless. Finally, County Magistrate Bai called on everyone to continue to pursue the despotic landlords and stated that the government would resolutely support them and ensure that everyone thoroughly turned themselves around. The meeting place erupted with earth-shattering cheers: "Support the government!" "Support the Communist Party!" County Magistrate Bai then personally awarded the models who reported hidden landlord guns: Zhao Qixing from Nanyuan Village in the fourth district voluntarily reported four new rifles, and a woman from Sanguaitou reported a light machine gun, each receiving a bonus of 15,000 yuan and a medal.

This meeting enlightened the class consciousness of the broad masses of peasants. After a cadre from Fu Village returned from the meeting, he immediately took out a hidden handgun and resolutely carried out the struggle. Backward peasants in Lv Village, who had previously hidden 300 mu of landlord land during rent reduction, also voluntarily reported it. Cadres and militiamen in the village who had previously burned incense and sworn oaths with the landlords and shielded the landlords also told the truth. The movement in various villages is now deepening.

　　大小元宝一大堆，都是农民血汗账！
    临淇万八千人举行大会
    揭露地主吸血罪行
    人人切齿痛恨非把地主斗透不行
    【本报林县讯】林县四、六区为推动土地改革运动继续深入，使农民彻底翻身，特于本月七、八两日在临淇召开一万八千人的群众大会，展览斗争对象与斗争果实，集体控诉恶霸地主的滔天罪行，并表扬自动报出隐藏地主枪支财物的模范。大会第一日为大展览。一万八千人集合到临淇镇上，恶霸地主们站在堆积如山的斗争果实后面，向群众供述他压迫剥削农民的罪恶历史。有的地主不说老实话，马上受到群众的怒斥。一个白发老太太跟在地主后面，用小棍子边打边说：“我要揭出这一肚子的冤气呀！”淇东六区西泽下面的大地主张明善，高帽子上面写着：“张明善剥削穷人真狠心，小斗出，大斗进。”在他面前摆着大斗和小斗，佃户们看见都说：“咱们的穷根子在这上面！”张明善过去占有土地二千五百亩，斗出的大小元宝有三百四十个，共重一百三十五斤。大家指点着元宝说：“咱这一辈子谁见过这些元宝呢！”另外，还摆着成千成百现洋和各种各样的绸缎衣服和埋烂了的麦子小米。人们看着那结成一块块的粮食，都愤怒说：“你看地主多造孽，咱们穷人在灾荒年景，逃荒在外，饿死都吃不上粮食！”四区观音庙村一个七八十岁的老汉见人就说：“赶这大会是我一辈子最快乐的事，要不是毛主席领导好，谁能赶这样大的会呢！”大会第二日是对恶霸地主的大控诉。淇东六区申区长重复表明政府一定给群众作主，希望没翻透身的父老兄弟能把肚子里的苦都倒出来。牛家岗村薛文贵第一个说：“俺家给刘小五种了三辈子地，一切官工（为地主服劳役）不说，俺娘还要给他家碾谷，一天碾六石，六石碾五斗半，他说没有碾够六斗，把俺娘打了一顿赶出来。弄得俺家没办法往山西逃荒，饿死三口人。”阎秀花接着说：“俺九岁卖到阎振全家当使女，他天天黑夜吸大烟，叫俺一边伺候着他，整夜不能睡觉，一瞌睡人家就打。跟我一块有个七岁的使女，他家小孩跌了跤怪那使女，把人家推到崖底下活活跌死了！”许多女人听着听着就掉下泪来。阎翠英一面哭一面诉：“俺也是八岁到阎多炳家当使女，十五岁才离开他家。七八年来，天天黑夜给人家提尿盆，一夜要提四五次。有时咱睡着了，多少误点事，人家就叫脱去衣服，拿大棍子狠打，有时在当院跪半夜！”赵扬城村的钟有青接着说：“俺家过去给义生堂种了六辈子地，出了许多官工，他家盖房子，成年给他帮工。等房子盖成啦，就不叫我种地啦！俺没法，逃荒到山西，饿死两口人。”他的话没说完，井沟李殿元抢着说：“让俺也诉诉这一肚子苦吧！俺当初在武锡明坡里开荒，说好不论开多少，每年交租一石，养起的树是对半分。这样咱就加劲开起来。那一年年景不好，地里没打上粮食，人家把粮食都要去了，咱连一把粗糠也没剩下！只好跟邻家东借西借，弄点糠吃吃，吃不饱，就吃白土，吃树叶，俺的三个孩子就在那年饿死了”他边哭边说：“开地开到十来年头上，地主看见树长大啦，硬把树都要去了，咱吃了亏，也不敢说。这还不算，等俺开地开到四十亩，人家要换武金家的平地，把俺的地都夺去了。咱开了二十多年地，算白替人家开了。提起来咱这一辈子真是把人间的苦都受完啦！我今天非把地主斗光，叫他也受一受罪！”受地主欺压剥削的人们就这样一个跟一个诉下去，都是诉不完的苦。最后白县长号召大家继续向恶霸地主进行追击，并表明政府坚决撑腰作主，一定要使每个人都翻透身。会场沸腾起震天的欢呼：“拥护政府！”“拥护共产党！”白县长接着亲自给报出隐藏地主枪支的模范发奖：四区南园村赵其兴自动报出四支新步枪，三拐头一个妇女报出轻机枪一挺，各发奖金一万五千元，奖章一个。
    这次大会启发了广大农民的阶级觉悟。付村的一个干部开会回去后，立即把隐藏的手枪拿出来，坚决进行斗争。吕庄落后农民过去减租时隐藏地主的三百亩地，也都自动报出。该村干部民兵过去和地主烧香盟誓、包庇地主的事也都说了出来。现各村运动正在深入开展中。
