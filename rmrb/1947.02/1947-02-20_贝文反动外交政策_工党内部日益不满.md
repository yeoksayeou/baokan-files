　　Bevin's Reactionary Foreign Policy
    Growing Discontent Within the Labour Party
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: London dispatch: The movement within the Labour Party criticizing Bevin's foreign policy is developing daily. According to a France Press report, Labour MP Silverman declared in Birmingham on the evening of the 15th: "If Labour MPs could vote freely, two-thirds of them would oppose Bevin's foreign policy." He also said, "When we and the United States possess many strategic locations in the world, why shouldn't we recognize the Soviet Union's rights to the Dardanelles Strait?" On the other hand, at a secret meeting of Labour Party members in London on the same evening, Bevin strongly defended his foreign policy. Although Bevin's speech was not published, it is said that he mentioned the Palestine issue, British policy towards the Soviet Union, and Anglo-American relations. France Press reported: "There were many questions at the meeting, and Bevin strongly countered all attacks."

　　贝文反动外交政策
    工党内部日益不满
    【新华社延安十七日电】伦敦讯：工党内部诘责贝文外交政策的运动日益发展。据法新闻社报导，工党议员希尔维曼十五日晚，在伯明翰宣称：“工党议员如果能自由投票时，其中三分之二会反对贝文的外交政策。”并称：“当我们与美国拥有世界上许多战略地点时，我们为什么不应承认苏联对达达尼尔海峡的权利呢？”另一方面，同日晚在伦敦工党党员秘密会议上，贝文强烈地为自己的外交政策辩护，贝文的演说虽未发表，但据称他会提及巴力斯坦问题，英国对苏政策，及英美关系。法新闻社称：会上“质问很多，贝文强力反击一切进攻”。
