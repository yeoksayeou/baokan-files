Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 17th: According to a Wenhui Daily news report on January 27th, the Chiang government's unlimited requisition of grain has provoked fierce opposition even within its own puppet organs. The Jiangxi Provincial Assembly issued a circular last month, appealing to all provincial assemblies to unanimously demand that the Chiang Central Government cease the actual levy of field tax, requisition, and the "Diligent Administration" policy. The Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial Assembly has already resolved to agree (it is reported that the assemblies of Jiangsu and Hubei provinces have also made similar requests). The circular demands that these grain policies be stopped from the 36th year [1947], and that the Ministry of Food and the grain administration agencies of various provinces be abolished. It stated: "At present, in rural areas, farmhouses are empty, cattle and farm implements are scattered, and fields are barren. With the actual levy, requisition, and county-level public grain, plus local apportionments, farmers' harvests for half a year, nine-tenths of it, goes to officials, leaving them with only one-tenth." The same newspaper reported: The Changchun County Assembly, considering the excessive amount of field tax in the 35th year [1946], also demanded a reduction of half the tax on January 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 16th: According to reports in the Shanghai Dagong Daily on January 13th and 29th: The average farming family in Nantong pays over 100,000 yuan in taxes per month. The total budget for Shanghai this year amounts to over 60,000 yuan in taxes per citizen. In Taihua Township, Tang County, on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, regular apportionments for district and township expenses, conscript fees, hospitality fees, damage fees, self-defense fees, consolation fees, miscellaneous fees, etc., amount to over 9 million yuan per month. In addition, there are over 20 million yuan for office expenses, over 10 million yuan for the construction of a single blockhouse, and field tax, mule and horse tax, smoking stove tax, and wealthy household tax are all extra. The Chiang government forcibly levied house tax in Huaiyin after occupying it. A poor old woman, with only 2,000 yuan left for living expenses, had it all taken away. In Songsheng Township, Qingpu, the stipulated amount for district and township expenses and security chief training fees alone reached over 600,000 yuan last month. Each security unit was apportioned over 90,000 yuan, and one unit with 15 jia (a unit of area) was apportioned 15,000 yuan per jia, and the actual amount collected exceeded the original amount by one and a half times.
