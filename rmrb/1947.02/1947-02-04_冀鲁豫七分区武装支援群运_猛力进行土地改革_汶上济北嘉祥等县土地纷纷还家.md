[This dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan correspondent, dated January 31st] Since the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Seventh Sub-district Party Committee proposed "rectifying work styles and establishing merit" and land reform at the county-level Party Secretary joint meeting last month, cadres' morale has been universally high, and great achievements have been made in land reform in the past half-month. The situation in Wenshang, Jibei, Nanwang and other counties is summarized as follows: At the beginning of the month, the Wenshang County Party Committee, based on the land reform policy, specifically organized its forces. Because the eastern part of the county frequently encountered enemy attacks from @ and Jinan, and there were many special agents, the county brigade armed work team and district cadres were organized into the movement. Under the direct leadership of the county, taking Zhang Wu Village in the Second District as the core, land reform was completed in 60 villages in the entire district within ten days. The activities of Chiang's special agents were initially suppressed, organizations were established, and many "blank villages" where Chiang's special agents were active were transformed into consolidated liberated areas. Jining, in launching a heroic guerrilla war, struck at the arrogance of the enemy and puppets, protected the interests of the masses, and opened up the work situation. Then, focusing on the Fourth and Fifth Districts, a vigorous land reform was carried out. After extensive propaganda and legal education in the Fourth District, a meeting of more than 400 village cadres from the entire district was convened to educate them on "land returning home." Under the slogan of "The front fights old Chiang, the rear digs up Chiang's roots," land reform was completed in two sub-districts within ten days. Xin Dian Village, less than twenty miles away from Jining City, also completed land reform despite frequent enemy harassment. After the masses obtained land, their struggle against the enemy became more resolute. Militiamen take turns monitoring enemy activities every day. Farmers who obtained land conducted a "killing chickens to pledge allegiance," and proposed a "land protection movement." Enemy attacks have been repelled every time. In the past half month, Jibei County has implemented the land reform movement in a "large-scale production" manner. In the movement, activists were trained and the experience of hired tenants was used. Within three days, the situation in five villages including Datongyang in the Seventh District was opened up, turning the masses' emotions from cold to hot. After the masses' emotions warmed up, eighteen villages have already been mobilized. In Nanwang, under the heavy task of war, land reform was carried out in the Sixth District. While undertaking war tasks, land distribution work was also carried out. The leadership first carried out division of labor, which not only completed the war work, but also completed land reform in twelve villages within twelve days, creating the experience of combining land and war. After transforming the guerrilla thinking of cadres in Jiaxiang, they immediately put forward the policy of "Oppose Chiang and avenge, let land return home." The movement has now been launched in the Zifang District. The steps taken by the counties are roughly as follows: The first step was to carry out propaganda and education, with two main contents: (1) Publicize the land reform decree; (2) Publicize the current situation and eliminate the "change of dynasty" thinking. The second step was to train activists. After the activists understood their thinking, they returned home to conduct discussions among the masses. The third step was to find bad landlords to launch struggles, take action, settle accounts and complain, and seek the full mobilization of the masses. After struggling against a few bad elements, the next step was to propose "offering property." The fourth step was mass review, distribution of fruits, overturning old contracts, establishing new contracts, and measuring land. The fifth step was land protection education.
