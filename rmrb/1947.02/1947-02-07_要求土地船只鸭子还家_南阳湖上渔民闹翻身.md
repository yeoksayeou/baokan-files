[Transmitted by] This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 3rd Dispatch: Fishermen on Nanyang Lake in Jining are demanding the return of land, boats, and ducks. There are more than thirty small villages under Nanyang Lake in Jining, newly designated as the Lake District. There are two parts to this area: lake residents and fishermen. Lake residents have homes and boats, making a living by fishing, harvesting reeds, collecting grass, and raising ducks. Fishermen live by catching ducks and fishing, without homes and living entirely on boats. Each boat has a foreman, and there are landlords on the lake. In the past, fishermen suffered from oppression from both sides: the Kuomintang's deadly fish tax and the severe exploitation by landlords and foremen. With the liberation of the Lake District, the heavy fish tax on their heads was lifted, leaving only the exploitation of landlords, foremen, and others. The methods of exploitation were numerous; they monopolized most of the fishing tools and also monopolized fish prices, forcing fishermen without capital or tools to depend on them. Renting tools required paying high interest and heavy taxes. Generally, poor fishermen provided labor, while landlords and foremen provided tools. The fish caught was split in half, but the fisherman's half had to be sold to the landlord, who would calculate the weight as 150 catties for every 100, and the price was calculated extremely low. As a result, most fishermen were very poor. In winter, they would get up early, eat a little food, and then fish and harvest reeds on the ice all day, only able to eat another meal when it got dark. Their whole bodies were frozen, and some couldn't even afford cotton clothes, ending the year with nothing. On the other hand, the land, boats, and ducks of the landlords and foremen were increasing day by day. Some landlords had three or four *qing* of land, thousands of ducks, and five or six boats, all of which were the product of the blood and sweat of poor fishermen. In the Lake District, we proposed "Land to the tiller," but some fishermen were not enthusiastic. After in-depth understanding, it was found that demanding land to the tiller was only part of the issue; most fishermen were demanding the return of boats, reeds, and ducks. We promptly issued a call, and the peasants took active action. Fishermen on the lake are gathering boat by boat to hold discussions, discussing how to struggle and how to distribute the fruits of victory. Now, the fishermen on the lake are mobilized.

    要求土地船只鸭子还家
    南阳湖上渔民闹翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】济宁南阳湖上渔民要求土地、船只、鸭子还家。济宁南阳湖下有三十多个小村，新划为湖上区，这里有湖民渔民两部分，湖民有家有船，以打鱼、捞苇子、捞草、养鸭等为生活；渔民以打鸭捕鱼为生，无家一切都是在船上。各船有帮头，湖上有地主，过去渔民们受着两方面的压迫，国民党逼死人的鱼税和地主帮头的严重剥削。随着湖上区的解放，他们头上重重的鱼税被解除，剩下来的就是地主帮头等的剥削，剥削的办法很多，他们垄断大部捕鱼工具，并且垄断鱼价，使没有资本和生产工具的渔民仰求于他。渔民租借工具要付出高额利息及苛重的税租，一般的贫苦渔民出人力，地主帮头出工具，捞了鱼对半分，渔夫的那一半还必须卖给他，算账时一百五十斤顶一百斤，价钱算的额外低。这样大多数渔民是很苦的，冬天早起吃一点饭就在冰上打鱼捞苇子，一直劳动一天，到天黑才能吃另一顿饭。他们全身都是冰的，有的连棉衣都穿不上，一年到头一无所有。在另一方面地主帮头的土地船只，却一天天的多起来有的地主一家有三四顷地，几千只鸭，五六只船，这都是贫苦渔民血汗的结晶。在湖上区我们提出了“土地还家”，有部分渔民不够热心，经过深入了解之后，要求土地还家只是一部分，大部渔民是要求船只、苇子、鸭子回家。我们又及时提出号召，农民就积极行动起来了。湖上渔民，船和船并起来开讨论会，讨论看怎样斗争，怎样分配果实，现在湖上的渔民是动起来了。
