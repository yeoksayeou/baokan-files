　　Yanggu Uses United Struggle
    Actively Transform Fake Peasant Associations
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu, 21st dispatch] During the mass movement in Yanggu, many fake peasant associations were discovered. Statistics from the first, third, and fifth districts show over forty fake peasant associations. The reasons for their existence: Landlords bought off bad elements to organize peasant associations, controlling the leadership from behind the scenes, preventing the basic masses from rising up. With cadres conducting in-depth inspections and actively transforming them, more than half of the fake peasant associations have now become genuine peasant associations. The experience in transforming fake peasant associations: (1) Moving the stones. For example, the chairman of the fake peasant association in Jiang Village, Fifth District, was exploited by the feudal rich peasant Wang Fugui. After the district cadres discovered this, they actively enlightened the masses to reorganize the peasant association and remove the stones. (2) Leading the masses to participate in struggles, arousing the masses' fighting spirit.

　　阳谷用联合斗争
    积极改造假农会
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】阳谷群运中发现许多假农会。一、三、五三个区的统计有四十多个假农会。产生的原因：地主收买坏蛋出来组织农会，自己在后面掌握领导权，使基本群众不敢起来。在干部深入检查积极改造下，现已有二分之一以上假农会变成真农会了。改造假农会的经验：（一）搬石头。如五区姜庄假农会长被封建富农王富贵利用，区干部发现后，积极启发群众整理农会，搬掉石头。（二）领导群众参加斗争，鼓起群众斗争情绪。
