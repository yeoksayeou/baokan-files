    【This Newspaper, Taiyue, 5th】 Land reform in Qin County has reached its final stage. Eighty percent of the villages in the county have realized "land to the tiller," and 40,000 landless and land-poor peasants have obtained land. Sixty-seven villages were completed on average before the New Year's Day. These villages are now fully engaged in summing up their experiences of liberation, the content of which is: 1. Everyone should think about the past and compare it with the present, calculate a "liberation account," and politically raise their class consciousness. 2. Everyone should make a "liberation plan" in preparation for entering into large-scale production. 3. Everyone should check whether feudal forces and feudal exploitation have been completely eliminated, and combine this with village-level elections to reorganize the government and elect farmers' associations. The remaining villages are expected to complete the work around the Grain Rain (mid-April). Now the focus of work has shifted to backward villages, with key cadres concentrating their efforts. In addition, a group of advanced village cadres and activists have been mobilized, carrying grain to help backward villages achieve liberation. Currently, cadres throughout the county are working day and night. Guo Village did not stop the struggle even on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Villages such as Fancun Chengguan only rested for one morning, and in the afternoon, they only held meetings, striving to complete land reform throughout the county before the Grain Rain.
    【This Newspaper, Gaoping】 Quancheng in the first district of Gaoping, timely corrected mistakes in the "leveling and replenishing" movement, and realized "land to the tiller". At the beginning of the leveling and replenishing process in the village, village cadres mobilized a universal land contribution, and many middle peasants, fearing struggle, wanted to contribute land, which once caused panic. After discovering the mistake, the cadres immediately made a self-criticism and stopped the land contribution. At the same time, they launched a re-examination of the liberation process and discovered that feudal vestiges were still very strong. They then jointly conducted a general liquidation against twelve treacherous and tyrannical landlords, unearthing more than 200 mu of land, with each person receiving three mu to level out. Eighty-five repentant and reformed poor pseudo-bandits were given two and a half mu per person to level out, and thirteen poor peasant military dependents were given three and a half mu per person to level out, turning the completely destitute into middle peasants, thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller."
