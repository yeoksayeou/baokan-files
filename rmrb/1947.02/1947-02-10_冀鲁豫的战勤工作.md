The wartime support work in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has gone through a considerable period of exploration and effort and has achieved many successes. At present, as the War of Self-Defense is in a tense phase, we are introducing the experience of wartime support work in this region for reference:

    Several Key Points of Wartime Support Work

    1. Recognizing the Regularity of Wartime Support Work. The war is a relatively long-term undertaking, and wartime support work, which supports the war, must also be long-term. The leadership has grasped this point, corrected the phenomenon of cadres catching up temporarily and the masses responding temporarily, and has earnestly organized wartime support tasks into daily work.

    2. Conducting Ideological Education on Participation in the War for the Masses. Before the task arrives, ideological mobilization is carried out among the masses. During the execution of the task, ideological education is carried out. Puyang County has focused on this point. They use the method of free deliberation and discussion among the masses to make the masses connect their own past experiences (such as the cruelty of the 10th Army) to recognize Chiang Kai-shek's cruelty, and enhance their anti-Chiang enthusiasm. With activists as the backbone, they encourage each other and improve the masses' awareness and willingness to participate in the war. The stretcher teams in the farms gather and set off within a few minutes after receiving notice, indicating the masses' ideological consciousness.

    3. Strict Organization and Clear Tasks. For example, Guan County, Puyang County and other places have mastered the combination of county, district, and village-level cadres. The cadres of the village headquarters have strict division of labor, each with specific responsibilities, and several tasks are carried out in categories. For example, the headquarters of Qianxiatao Village in the fourth district of Guancheng County simultaneously entertains passers-by, struggles against local bullies and landlords, and mills rice for the troops, without interfering with each other, and all tasks can be completed.

    4. Clear Rewards and Punishments. In Fan County, there was a period when the problem of fleeing masses on errands was not dealt with in a timely manner, so fleeing became a trend for a time, and those who completed the task were cursed by the masses as "Turtle Heads." Puyang County has done a better job in this regard. Those who return halfway without reason will still have to take turns on the next business trip. Individuals or collectives who complete the task are given verbal or material rewards. The masses have a clear boundary between completing the task or not, and they recognize participation in the war as an honor. In general, we should emphasize the reward aspect and promptly commend models in order to implement the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the war.

    5. Reasonable Methods of Dispatching Labor. Collect the opinions and reflections of the masses, formulate fair and reasonable methods for dispatching labor, discuss and decide by the masses, and then implement them, so that it is easy to improve the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the war.

    The Combination of Wartime Support and Various Tasks

    1. Combining Wartime Support with Land Reform. Land is the issue that the masses care about most. When these vital issues are obtained, or are being properly resolved, the masses will actively participate in the war to defend their land. The experience of the fourth district of Guan County powerfully illustrates this point. In the early stage of mobilizing wartime support work, the masses were tired, unwilling to go on errands, or forced to go on errands, and ran away after going on errands. The village cadres also dealt with it with an attitude of dealing with official affairs. However, in the land reform movement, the masses' emotions changed greatly. When wartime support tasks arrived, they automatically gathered without waiting to be urged, and automatically solved various problems, such as temporarily paying for travel rations, organizing young people to replace dispatched militiamen, and discussing fair and reasonable dispatch methods, which powerfully supported the village cadres and activists in carrying out various tasks. The masses in the fourth district of Nanfeng said: "As long as there is land to cultivate, we can carry it for a year or two." The masses have turned over and their awareness has improved, and wartime support has become a mass movement and a matter of the masses themselves. In promoting the land reform movement, wartime support and war preparation can also be well combined. Xin Dian, a border area of ​​Jining, is an example of holding a gun in one hand and dividing land in the other, while supporting the front line.

    2. Combining Wartime Support with Production. Fan Zhuzhuang Village in the first district of Fan County, Da Liushu Village in the first district of Guancheng County, and other villages, have organized mutual aid groups in the whole village. After solving the contradiction between wartime support and production, the masses' worries about leaving their families and being unable to produce after going on errands were swept away. The method is: the livestock that are not on errands are used centrally, the labor force is concentrated to work, and special personnel are responsible for taking care of the work of the masses on errands first. Therefore, the masses are very enthusiastic about going on errands. They said: "Going out is not a worry at all." Without any worries, and participating in the war to defend their own fruits, everyone strives to be a war hero.

    3. Accurate Calculation to Avoid Waste. The leadership should pay close attention to the issue of waste of financial and material resources and manpower. There are cases in Yunbei where village food and village funds exceed public grain by several times. After this was discovered, a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of village burdens was carried out, systems were established, and waste was overcome. Investigate labor and use it scientifically to avoid waste of manpower.

    Several Characteristics

    1. Civilian-Loving Civilian Movement. After issuing the call for the "Civilian-Loving Civilian" movement to the masses participating in the war, the stretcher teams, cart teams, and militia teams in various counties carried out village stationing work, competing to solve the temporary labor shortages of the masses stationed in the villages. For example, the militia brigade in Hua County, the cart teams in Gaoling and Neihuang, and the stretcher team in Shou Zhang all plowed the land and did odd jobs for the masses stationed in the villages, "exchanging good for good," and the local masses competed to send cigarettes, wine, and vegetables to express their gratitude to them. As a result of such mutual influence, not only is the close relationship between the two parties enhanced, but also the problems of discipline and the habit of randomly moving and stealing things are automatically stopped, and the difficulties of the masses on errands are also easily solved.

    2. Cadres Take the Lead. Cadres play a decisive and leading role in completing wartime support tasks. Cadres usually live with the stretcher bearers; they are firm and calm in times of danger, and support the masses, such as in Qingfeng, Nanle, Shou Zhang and other counties. The cadres who lead the stretchers either carry the stretchers themselves or carry the colored flags on the front line with illness. "The cadres have gone, what are we afraid of?" Under the encouragement of the cadres, the masses rushed to the front line, and even if they only ate one meal a day and night, they could be happy and without complaint. This not only untied the knot between the leadership and the masses, but also relieved the masses' fear, and everyone strove to serve the war.

    3. Heroic Deeds in Wartime Support. Many model cadres and masses have emerged in the participation in the war, greatly developing new heroism. In several major battles, countless heroic models serving the people and the war can be seen. Comrade Xia Shuping from Puyang personally led the stretcher to actively educate and organize the complex emotions of the stretcher masses in the Longhai Campaign, personally went to the front line, carried the colored flags, and walked in the forefront, influencing and encouraging the cadres and masses to forget their fatigue and the threat of bullets, and everyone bravely rushed to the front line, reversing the chaotic situation and successfully completing the task. Wang Dian'an's stretcher in Kunwu transported three wounded at a time by carrying one, holding one, and carrying one on his back. The militiamen not only protected and rescued the wounded soldiers as much as possible, but also collected enemy weapons and equipment to equip themselves at any time. These heroes and models have made significant contributions to the War of Self-Defense by leading the masses.

    冀鲁豫的战勤工作
    冀鲁豫战勤工作，曾经过相当时期的摸索和努力，也取得不少成绩。目前正值自卫战争翻越山头的紧张时候，今特将该区战勤工作经验介绍于下，以供各地参考：
    战勤工作的几个重点
    一、认识战勤工作的经常性。战争是较长时期的，支持战争之一的战勤工作也不能不是较长时期的，领导上把握这点，纠正了干部临时抓和群众临时应付的现象，把战勤任务认真组织到日常工作中来。
    二、对群众进行参战的思想教育。任务到来前，在群众中作思想动员，任务执行中进行思想教育，濮县对这点抓得很紧，他们用群众自己自由酝酿讨论方式，使群众从过去亲身经验中（如十军团的残暴）联系认识蒋介石的残暴提高反蒋热情，以积极分子为骨干，相互鼓励，提高群众自觉，自愿参战。农庄担架经过教育，在得到通知几分钟后即集合出发，说明群众思想的自觉。
    三、组织严密、任务明确。如观城濮县等掌握县区村三级干部的结合，村指挥部干部严密分工，各负专责，几种任务分类进行。如观城四区前夏淘村指挥所一面招待过往人员，一面斗争恶霸地主，一面给部队碾米，各不相碍，也都各能完成任务。
    四、赏罚严明。范县有个时期对出差群众逃跑问题未及时处理，因之逃跑一时形成浪潮，完成任务的反被群众骂作“孙头”。濮县在这方面抓的紧则做得较为成功，对无故半途而返的参战群众，下次出差时仍得轮流，对完成任务的个人或集体给以口头或物资嘉奖，群众有了完成任务与否明确界限，且认参战为光荣。但总的应重赏的一面，及时表扬模范，以贯彻群众参战热情。
    五、合理的支差办法。集合群众意见、反映、制订公平合理的支差办法，经群众讨论，决定，而后施行，如此则易提高群众参战热情。
    战勤与各种工作的结合
    一、战勤与土地改革结合。土地是群众最关心的一个问题，当这一切身问题获得了，或正在获得适当解决，群众就会为保卫自己的土地积极参战。观城四区的经验，有力的说明这点。该地在战勤工作发动初期，群众情绪疲蹋，不出差，或被迫出差，出差之后逃跑，村干也以支应公事态度对付；但在土地改革运动中，群情为之大变，遇有战勤任务到来，不待催就自动集合，并自动解决各项问题，如暂垫出差草粮，组织青壮年以代替出差民兵，议订公平合理的支差办法等，有力的支持村干与积极分子展开各种工作。南峰四区群众说：“只要有地种，抬它一年两年都行”群众翻身觉悟提高，战勤成为群众性的运动，成为群众自己的事。在推进土地改革运动中，战勤与备战也能够很好的结合起来，济宁边沿区辛店一面一手拿枪一手分地，一面支援前线即是一例。
    二、战勤与生产结合。范县一区范朱庄，观城一区大柳树等村，全村组织起互助组；解决战勤与生产矛盾后，扫去了群众出差挂家，无法生产的顾虑，办法是：不出差的牲口集中使用，劳动力集中做活，专人负责，尽先照顾出差群众的活计。因此群众出差情绪很高，他们说：“出去一点也不挂家”。没有了后顾之忧，又是为保卫自己的果实参战，大家争作参战英雄。
    三、精确计算力求避免浪费。对于财力与民力的浪费问题领导上应高度注意。郓北有村粮村款超过公粮数倍情况，经发现后即普遍深入检查村负担，规定制度，克服了浪费现象。调查劳力，科学使用，以避免民力的浪费。
    几个特点
    １、民爱民运动。对参战群众提出“民爱民”运动号召后，各县担架队、大车队、民兵队出差群众即进行驻村工作，竞为驻村群众解决暂时劳力不足困难，如滑县民兵大队、高陵、内黄大车队、寿张担架队等，都给驻村群众犁地，做杂活，“以好换好”，当地群众争送烟、酒、菜以表示对他们的感激。如此相互影响结果，不特增进双方关好的亲密，也连带解决了出差群众纪律，乱动乱偷东西的习惯自动停止，出差群众困难也易于解决。
    ２、干部带头。战勤任务的完成干部起着决定与带头作用。干部在平时与担架员生活打成一片；危险时坚定沉着，给群众撑腰，如清丰、南乐、寿张诸县，带领担架的干部，或亲自抬担架，或带病上火线背彩号，“人家干部都去，咱还有啥怕的。”群众在干部鼓舞下争先恐后上火线，虽一天一夜只吃一顿饭，也能愉快无怨。这不但解开了领导与群众脱节的疙瘩，也解除了群众害怕了的心理，人人争为战争服务。
    ３、战勤中的英雄业迹。参战中涌现不少模范的干部与群众，大大发挥了新英雄主义。在几次大的战役中，可以看到无数为人民为战争服务的英雄模范。濮阳夏树屏同志，在陇海战役中，亲带担架积极教育整理复杂的担架群众情绪，亲自上火线、背彩号、走在最前面，影响鼓励干部与群众忘掉疲累与枪弹威胁，大家奋勇涌向前线，扭转了惶乱局面，胜利完成任务。昆吾王殿安的一付担架，用抬一、架一、背一方式，一次运下三个伤员。民兵不仅尽可能的爱护、救下受伤战士，并且随时搜集敌人遗弃武器装备自己。这些英雄和模范，带领群众对自卫战争作了重大的贡献。
