　　Changzhi and Taichang
    Don't Smoke Cigarettes
    [This newspaper's Changzhi news] The Changzhi Xingtaichang business firm economizes on food and clothing to support the front lines, and unanimously decided to lower living standards: eat more millet and less white flour; from the manager down, everyone smokes small pipes instead of cigarettes; entertaining guests does not involve going to restaurants; except for special events, lights are turned off early at night; clothes are all made of homespun cloth. All the money saved above is sent to the front to comfort the Eighth Route Army. And first donate 50,000 yuan to a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army on the JiluYu front. (Sun Xiu)
