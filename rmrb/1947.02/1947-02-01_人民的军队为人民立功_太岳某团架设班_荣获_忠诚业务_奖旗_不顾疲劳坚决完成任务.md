    The People's Army Performs Meritorious Service for the People
　　A Signal Platoon of a Certain Regiment in Taiyue
    Awarded the "Loyal Service" Banner
    Tirelessly and Resolutely Completing Tasks
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue Front, 29th] The signal platoon of the special service company of a certain regiment in Taiyue recently won a red banner of "Loyal Service". This is because under the leadership of squad leader Jia Zhaolin, the platoon has consistently worked hard and been able to complete tasks even in the most difficult times, and has actively studied technology to improve work efficiency. In addition, they also captured four enemies. The platoon has eight signalmen, who often have to set up power lines ten or twenty miles away. Because there are not enough animals, each person has to carry a coil of wire when traveling, and they often voluntarily help the cooks carry oil and pots. When others are resting, they often work until late at night. During the Wangwu battle in Yuanqu, they were busy collecting wires and did not have time to eat all day. After collecting the wires, they hurried to catch up with the troops. When they arrived at the new camp, they didn't even take a break and were busy setting up the power lines again. Sometimes they even collected and set up the lines twice a day, with no rest time at all. During combat, they traveled back and forth in areas blockaded by enemy fire to set up and check lines, never being careless. Once, when enemy reinforcements advanced to near Gaoluo, the troops withdrew, but they insisted on staying behind to completely recover the wires before leaving. During the Shicun battle, when the troops were transferring, a divisional signalman still had a section of line that had not been recovered. The platoon's signalman, Lu Zhiming, disregarded the danger and voluntarily recovered this section of line. They have a clear division of labor for setting up lines, carrying lines, connecting lines, and finding lines. Since they switched to using two-ended lines, their movements have become even faster. On the 2nd of this month, Jia Zhaolin and He Furong captured a general while driving and setting up lines. During the Shicun battle, they captured three more prisoners. Ge Zhenhua, an excellent signalman in the platoon, was gloriously sacrificed in this charge with the troops.

    人民的军队为人民立功
　　太岳某团架设班
    荣获“忠诚业务”奖旗
    不顾疲劳坚决完成任务
    【本报太岳前线二十九日电】太岳某团特务排架设班，最近荣获“忠诚业务”的红色奖旗一面，因为该班在贾兆林班长领导下，一贯吃苦耐劳，在最艰难时也能完成任务，并积极研究技术，提高工作效率。此外，他们还俘虏过四个敌人。该班共有八个架设员，经常要到十里二十里地以外架设电线，因为牲口不够用，行车时每人还得背一拐线，而且还常常自动帮炊事员担油、背锅。宿营时，别人休息，他们常常工作到深夜。垣曲王屋战斗时，他们忙着收电线，一天没吃成饭，收罢线赶快去追部队，到了新的宿营地，他们连休息也不休息一下，又忙着架设电线了。有时甚至一天收两次、架两次，没有一点休息时间。作战时，他们往返在敌人火力封锁的地带架线、查线，从来没有马虎过。一次敌援军进至皋落附近，部队撤走了，他们仍坚持在后面把线完全收回才走。史村战斗，部队转移时，分区架设员还有一段线没有收完，该班架设员芦志明不顾危险，自动把这段线收回来。他们架线、扛线、接线、觅线都有明确分工，自从他们改用两头线后，动作就更加迅速了。本月二日，贾兆林、和福荣在行车架线时，把一个将军捉住了。史村战斗时，他们又捉到了三个俘虏。该班优秀的架设员葛振华，就是在这次随部队冲锋中光荣牺牲的。
