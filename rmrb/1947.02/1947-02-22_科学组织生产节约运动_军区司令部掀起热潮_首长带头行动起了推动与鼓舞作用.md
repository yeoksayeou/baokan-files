[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The fiery production and thrift campaign has drawn in everyone at the Military Region Headquarters. Each person is choosing and carrying out the production work most suitable for them, all in the name of completing or exceeding the target of ten thousand yuan in production value. During rest periods after meals each day, the entire office has forty-two spinning wheels turning. Twelfth Platoon alone has fourteen spinning wheels. In a short period, the various departments have spun fifteen jin of yarn. The cotton they spin comes from the headquarters' textile factory. The military region headquarters established this textile factory to independently resolve the living issues of family members and to accommodate retired soldiers who were unwilling to leave the army. Anyone who can spin top-quality yarn can receive three jin of raw cotton from the textile factory (second-grade receives two jin twelve liang, third-grade receives two jin and a half). After spinning it into yarn, they only hand over one jin to the factory, and the rest is theirs to keep entirely (worth about 1,800 to 1,900 yuan). Comrades in the cooking staff have also organized a tofu workshop in their spare time. Currently, they have earned a profit of 70,000 yuan and are also raising fifteen pigs. For personnel with specialized skills, the management section has organized them to establish a blacksmith shop, carpentry shop, and barber shop. The income from their production is divided at an 80/20 split. In addition to carrying out transportation production, the livestock handlers have also organized a mill to solve their own production tasks. In addition, the management section has also opened a flour mill, which, in addition to engaging in public production, can supply the office with more than 3,000 jin of meat throughout the year, ensuring a certain standard of living for all personnel in the office. In the course of production, everyone has also saved 171 pairs of shoes, 97 pairs of socks, 11 pairs of cotton shoes, 3 sets of cotton clothing, and 9 pieces of single-layer clothing and pants, as well as more than 2,000 jin of subsidized rice. According to Chief Yang of the Military and Political Affairs Department: The widespread and enthusiastic development of the production and thrift campaign in the headquarters this time was greatly promoted by the personal actions of the leading cadres. He said: Vice Commander Teng's letter to the branch committee on the eleventh of last month, and his saving of everything he was entitled to receive, Vice Political Commissar Bo's call to action at the party member meeting on February 3rd, and Vice Commander Wang's initiative to cancel personal attendants, etc., have all given every comrade great encouragement and determination. He also said: After the production and thrift drive, the work of all personnel in the office has become even more intense. Now everyone is working hard to complete their work and complete their production tasks.

　　科学组织生产节约运动
    军区司令部掀起热潮
    首长带头行动起了推动与鼓舞作用
    【本报特讯】火热的生产节约运动，把军区司令部全体人员都卷进去了。每个人都在为着完成或者超过一万块钱的生产任务，选择进行着自己最适当的生产工作。当每天饭后休息的时候，整个机关就有四十二部纺车在转动。单十二班一个部门，就有十四部纺车。短短期间中，各个部门已纺了十五斤线。他们纺花的来源，是由司令部的纺织工厂供给的。为了机关独立解决家属人员的生活，安插一些不愿离开部队的荣退军人，军区司令部才成立了这座纺织工厂。凡是能纺头等纱的人员，就可以在纺织工厂领到三斤生花，（二等的领二斤十二两，三等的领二斤半）纺成纱后，只交厂方一斤，其余则全部自得（约合一千八九百元）。炊事员同志在工余时间，也组织了豆腐房生产，目前他已获利七万元，还养了十五口猪。一些专门技术的人员，管理科就组织他们成立铁匠炉，木匠铺和理发馆，他们生产所得，采取二八分红。饲养员同志除进行运输生产外，还组织起一个磨房，以解决自己的生产任务。此外，管理科还开办了一座粉房，除进行公家生产外，全年可以供给机关三千多斤肉，保证了机关全体人员一定的生活水平。在生产过程中，大家又节约鞋一七一双，袜九十七双，棉鞋十一双，棉衣三套，单衣、单裤共九件，津贴米两千余斤。据军政处杨处长说：这次司令部的生产节约运动的普遍热烈开展，首长亲自动手，起了很大的推动作用。他说：滕副司令员上月十一日写给支委会的信，并节约一切应领东西，薄副政委二月三号在党员大会上的号召，和王副司令员自动取消小鬼等带头行动，都给每个同志以很大的鼓舞和决心。他又说：经过生产节约以后，全机关人员的工作都更加紧张了，现在大家都正在为完成自己的工作，完成自己的生产而努力。
