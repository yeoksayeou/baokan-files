    Military Region Commends Meritorious Troops
    Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Troops and Taiyue Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit
    Achieve Great Feats by Long-Distance Raids Deep into Enemy Territory
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jinji-Luyu Military Region recently issued an order to commend meritorious troops who achieved significant victories by raiding deep into Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn enemy territory. The order stated: "On January 21st, amidst heavy snowfall, the troops of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district launched an attack south of the Daoqing Railway. After a forced march of over a hundred li, they captured Wen County in one fell swoop, cleared more than ten enemy strongholds in the vicinity, annihilated two enemy platoons, and captured more than 130 local tyrants. In late January, the Taiyue Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit crossed over 200 li of Chiang-occupied territory, penetrated deep behind enemy lines, destroyed the reactionary regime in the Second District of Yishi, and repelled enemy reinforcements seven times our size, killing and capturing more than 70 stubborn puppet soldiers. This spirit of not fearing fatigue or hardship and making contributions to the people fully demonstrates the essence of the people's army and should be commended in a circular." The Military Region also simultaneously issued an order to commend the Taiyue troops who recovered Lingshi County and effectively cooperated with friendly neighboring areas in combat.
    [Dispatch from Taiyue, This Newspaper, 7th] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily recently published an article calling for learning from the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Brigade of Southern Shanxi, which frequently achieves victories with ratios of 0 to 21, 30, or even 40 casualties, with no casualties or very few casualties on our side, giving the enemy annihilating blows. This has pointed out the correct direction for guerrilla warfare in the entire region. Local armed guerrilla units throughout the region should learn from the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit and create more Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Units. It further pointed out that the characteristics of the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit are, first and foremost, the result of implementing the correct policy of "enemy advances, we advance" and the flexible tactics of winning by surprise. Its leader, Comrade Zhao Chuan, is a model of wisdom and courage, best at clever disguises, feinting attacks, catching the enemy off guard, and bravely and quickly annihilating them. When the enemy "sweeps" us, they do not retreat, but boldly penetrate deep behind enemy lines to sweep the enemy, subjecting the enemy to attacks from both front and rear, forcing them to flee back. Secondly, all commanders and fighters of the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit have a fine style of hard work, heroic struggle, and tenacity. In order to win battles, they disregard all hardships and dangers (such as eating only three meals in three days during this operation). The more bold, tenacious, and calm they are, the more they can exchange small sacrifices for great victories. They are united internally and can unite the masses, so they are welcomed by the masses everywhere.

    军区嘉奖有功部队
    太行四分区部队太岳赵川游击队
    远距离奔袭突入敌人纵深建奇功
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区顷发表命令，表扬以远距离奔袭突入蒋顽纵深，获得巨大战果的有功部队。命令内称：“太行四分区部队于一月二十一日大雪纷飞中，向道清路南出击，于百余里强行军之后，一举攻克温县县城，扫除附近据点十余处，歼敌两个中队，捕获恶霸一百三十余名。太岳赵川游击队于一月下旬，穿越纵深二百余里之蒋占区，深入敌后，摧毁猗氏二区之反动政权，并击退七倍于我之敌增援部队，毙俘顽伪七十余名。此种不怕疲劳、不畏艰险为人民立功的精神，正表现了人民军队的本质，应予通令嘉奖”。又军区对于收复灵石县城，有力配合友邻区作战的太岳部队，亦同时发表命令，予以表扬。
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳新华日报顷著论号召学习晋南赵川游击大队，经常以○比二十一、三十以至四十的战绩，以无一伤亡或很少伤亡，换得了较大的胜利，给敌人以歼灭性的打击，已为全区游击战指出了正确的方向。全区地方武装游击队应向赵川游击队学习，创造更多的赵川游击队。继指出赵川游击队的特点，首先是由于执行了敌进我进的正确方针与出奇制胜的灵活战术，它的领导者赵川同志是智勇兼备的模范，最善于巧妙伪装，声东击西，出敌不意与勇敢迅速的歼灭敌人。当敌人向我“扫荡”的时候，他们不是退缩，而是大胆的深入敌后去扫荡敌人，使敌人腹背受击，被迫回窜。其次，由于赵川游击队的全体指战员有艰苦奋斗英勇顽强的优良作风，为了打胜仗，不顾一切的劳苦和危险。（如此次作战中，三天内只吃饭三顿，）越是大胆顽强沉着，就越能以小的代价换取大的胜利。他们内部团结一致，又能团结群众，所以处处受到群众的欢迎。
