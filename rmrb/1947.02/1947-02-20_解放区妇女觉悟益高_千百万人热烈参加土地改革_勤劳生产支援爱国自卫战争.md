Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Poor women in the liberated areas are enthusiastically joining the land reform movement, becoming a magnificent force in the ranks of Chinese laborers who are turning over a new leaf. Materials from various locations show that, because women have suffered all kinds of cruel exploitation and feudal oppression for thousands of years, they are eager for economic liberation and political equality. Therefore, their enthusiasm in the movement is no weaker than that of men. In Jiaodong, 500,000 women participated in the land reform movement, distributing 500,000 mu of land. In Raoyang, Renqiu and other nine counties in central Hebei, 137,500 women participated in the movement in 388 villages, accounting for half of the total. In Ningnan (a new county, south of Ningjin) in southern Hebei, 50,000 women participated in the struggle. Even in 21 remote villages in the Jingxing County in the Taihang Mountains, more than 14,000 women poured into the emancipation movement. Many poor peasant women, sewing soles of shoes, going from one home to another, discussed how to get land back from landlords. In some areas, women even replaced their husbands in the struggle. In Kangzhuang, Jingxing County, Liu Zhifang's husband was deaf, so she took her children to the accusation meeting and reasoned with the landlord, obtaining five mu of land.

A large number of women heroes and model workers have emerged in the movement, becoming new leaders and key members among the masses. Li Fengniu's mother in Daliuyuan Village, Dacheng County, central Hebei, was oppressed by the landlord for a lifetime. In the first two days of the accusation meeting, she contacted 38 women and more than 80 poor peasants, held a preparatory meeting for accusations, and was elected as the "leader of accusations" by everyone. Zhang, from Shangdong Village, Yongzhi County (formerly Qingping County, Shandong), led accusations and shouted slogans, becoming one of the leaders of the land distribution movement in her village. In various land clearing and distribution committees in Jiaodong, women accounted for half of the members, all of whom are strong core members in the movement.

In the land reform movement, women's own organizations – women's federations – have also been reformed and developed. Previously, women's federations in many areas were just empty shells, with few members, many of whom were only members in name. After the movement, women felt that they had support when they joined the federation, so they dared to struggle. Peasants also felt that women's membership had practical benefits, so they supported their wives and daughters-in-law to join, thus the women's federation had a wide development. In Ningnan County, southern Hebei, 341 women's federations were reformed and established in the movement, with more than 50,000 women attending the congress. In Yongzhi County, 3,600 women in 35 villages participated in the women's federation. In Kangzhuang, Jingxing, 45 new members were developed in three days of the accusation movement.

"Family harmony and diligent production" is a new atmosphere in the countryside after land reform. In many areas, women held "thinking meetings," putting forward slogans such as "People are people, no one bullies anyone," "Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law work hard to produce, a good family life depends on harmony between daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, and sisters-in-law," and linking and comparing the tragic life in the old society, greatly improving women's political awareness.

After women turned over a new leaf, they enthusiastically supported the self-defense war. Moving stories of mothers sending their sons and wives sending their husbands to the battlefield are numerous. In Wulong County (a new county, south of Laiyang), Jiaodong, 104 women sent their sons and persuaded their husbands to join the army. Li Dama and Wang Dama from a village in Linyi, Shandong, personally sent their sons to the army, repeatedly urging them, "Good son, go ahead, don't come back if there is no peace." Zhao Keyi's daughter-in-law in Huachi Yuancheng District, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, persuaded her husband to join the army. At the time of parting, she encouraged him, "I will work hard to produce at home, defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and then come home to reunite!" Many women enthusiastically participated in logistical work. Since the beginning of winter, Shandong has sewn hundreds of thousands of cotton military uniforms and made hundreds of thousands of pairs of military shoes. In Buzicun, Linshu (a new county, east of Linyi), 121 sets of cotton clothes were voluntarily made, and fifteen-year-old girls and sixty-year-old grandmothers were vying to make them day and night, and all were completed in less than two days. Women in a district in Shuyang, northern Jiangsu, milled 700,000 jin of flour in a week. In the areas where the People's Liberation Army passed, women voluntarily organized laundry teams, set up tea stations, took care of the wounded soldiers, and checked pedestrians, becoming an important force in supporting the front line.

　　解放区妇女觉悟益高
    千百万人热烈参加土地改革
    勤劳生产支援爱国自卫战争
    【新华社延安十六日电】解放区千百万贫苦妇女热烈投入土地改革运动，成为中国劳动人民翻身行列中一支雄伟的大军。各地材料显示，由于妇女几千年遭受尽各种残酷剥削和封建压迫，她们迫切要求经济翻身和政治平等，因之在运动中的积极性并不弱于男子。胶东有五十万妇女参加了土地改革运动，分地五十万亩。冀中饶阳、任邱等九县三百八十八村就有十三万七千五百余妇女参加了运动，占全体的半数。冀南宁南（新县，宁晋南）一个县即有五万妇女参加斗争，甚至冀晋山地井陉县二十一个偏僻的乡村，也有一万四千余妇女涌入翻身运动。很多贫农妇女纳着鞋底，东家出西家进，互相商量，怎样向地主要回土地。若干地区妇女甚至代替了她们的丈夫参加斗争，井陉县康庄刘致芳的丈夫是个聋子，她就带着孩子在诉苦大会上和地主说理，分得土地五亩。
    在运动中涌现出大批的妇女英雄和模范，成为群众中新的领袖和骨干分子。冀中大城县大流源村李风牛的母亲被地主压迫了一辈子，在控诉会的头两天，她联络了三十八个妇女和八十多个贫苦农民；开了诉苦预备会，被大家选为“诉苦领头”。冀南永智县（原山东清平县）上东村张氏，领导诉苦喊口号，成为本村分地运动领袖之一。胶东各地清算委员会与分配委员会，妇女委员占半数，都是运动中有力的核心分子。
    在土地改革运动中，妇女自己组织——妇联会也得到改造和发展，以前许多地区的妇联会只是一个空架子，会员很少，其中还有许多是空名的会员；经过运动，妇女觉得入了会有人撑腰，就敢斗争，农民也觉得妇女入会有实际利益，从而赞助自己的妻子媳妇加入，因此妇联会有了广大发展。冀南宁南县在运动中改革和建立了三四一个妇联会，大会妇女五万余人。永智县三十五个村有三千六百余妇女参加妇联会，井陉康庄在诉苦运动三天中，就发展新会员四十五名。
    “家庭和睦勤劳生产”，是土地改革后农村的新气象，许多地区妇女召开“想想会”，提出“人都是人，谁也不欺负谁”，“婆婆媳妇勤生产，家庭过好光景靠媳婆妯娌和睦”等口号，联系对照过去旧社会时的悲惨生活，大大提高了妇女的政治觉悟。
    妇女翻身后，热烈支援自卫战争，母亲送儿、妻子送郎上战场的动人故事，比比皆是。胶东五龙县（新县，莱阳南）妇女送子、劝夫参军者有一○四名，山东临沂某庄李大娘、王大娘亲自把儿子送到部队，再三叮嘱“好儿子去吧，不和平别回来”。陕甘宁边区华池元城区赵克义的媳妇劝丈夫参军，临别时鼓励他说：“我在家勤生产，打败蒋介石反动派再回家团圆！”许多妇女热烈参加后勤工作，山东各地入冬以来，共缝制棉军装××万套，做军鞋××余万双，临沭（新县，临沂东）埠子村自动领作棉衣一百二十一套，十五岁小姑娘和六十多岁老大娘都争着日夜赶制，不到两天全部完成。苏北沭阳×区妇女一周磨面七十万斤。在人民解放军经过的地区，妇女们自动组织洗衣组、设立茶水站、看护伤兵、盘查行人，成为支援前线的重要力量。
