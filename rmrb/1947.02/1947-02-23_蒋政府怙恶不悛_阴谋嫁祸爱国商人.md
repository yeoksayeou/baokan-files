　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Shanghai, 19th - Following the February 9th Massacre, the Chiang government not only failed to severely punish the perpetrators but also attempted to shift the blame for its own crimes onto the employees of department stores. According to Wenhui Daily: The Chiang-controlled Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau summoned 25 directors and supervisors of department stores, questioning who initiated and proposed the "Promote National Products and Boycott American Goods Preparatory Committee," invited Deng Chumin and Guo Moruo to give speeches, and falsely accused the directors and supervisors of being the culprits. In response, Chen Shijun, the chairman of the Department Store Workers' Union, has expressed a firm attitude, saying that he will accept the court summons without fear and refuted the authorities' conspiracy to frame them, saying: "Department store employees are all ordinary people; how can they kill people without guns?" The "Shanghai February 9th Massacre Relief Association" also issued a declaration on the 13th, recounting the events of the February 9th bloodbath at the Quan Gong Building, denouncing the crimes of the Kuomintang secret agents, and sternly refuting Wu Guozhen's rumors and slander.

　　蒋政府怙恶不悛
    阴谋嫁祸爱国商人
    【新华社延安十九日电】上海十九日讯：二九惨案发生后，蒋政府非但不严惩凶手，且妄图将自身罪行嫁祸百货业职工。据文汇报消息：蒋记沪市府社会局，曾传讯百货业理监事二十五人，诘问“爱用国货抵制美货筹备会”为何人发起何人提议，请邓初民、郭沫若演讲并诬责该理监事等为罪魁祸首。对此，百货业职工会理事长陈施君已表示坚决态度谓：将接受法院传讯无所畏惧，他驳斥当局嫁祸阴谋说：“百货业职工都是老百姓，没有枪炮何能杀人。”“沪市二九惨案后援会”，亦已于十三日发表宣言，叙述劝工大楼二九血案经过，控诉国民党特务罪行，并严正驳斥吴国桢之造谣诬蔑。
