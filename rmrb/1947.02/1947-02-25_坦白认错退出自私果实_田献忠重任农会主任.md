Honest Admission of Mistakes, Return of Selfish Gains
Tian Xianzhong Reappointed as Chairman of the Farmers' Association
[Our newspaper's Jinan dispatch from the 23rd] Tian Xianzhong, the chairman of the Yongzhi Fanweizhuang Farmers' Association, after returning the embezzled gains, has resumed active work, and the masses have re-elected him to continue leading everyone. After the masses in Fanweizhuang were greatly mobilized, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Li Yaohua, had a very rigid style. The leadership removed him from his position and replaced him with An Baoyuan. An Baoyuan was the same, and he was also removed and replaced by Tian Xianzhong. Tian Xianzhong was a hired laborer who was very active in the struggle against the landlords. However, due to a lack of democratic supervision, he embezzled nearly 100,000 yuan, 500 jin of rice, and more than 100 jin of cotton from the fruits of the struggle, and colluded with Li Yaohua to engage in corruption and degeneration. The masses were very dissatisfied, and neither the large nor small meetings of the Farmers' Association could be held. After the Overturn-the-Old team arrived in the village, they discovered that the previous simple replacement was an incorrect approach and that only by following the mass line could the village cadres be transformed. On the one hand, they mobilized Tian Xianzhong to confess and reflect, and on the other hand, they asked the masses to say whatever they wanted and promised to resolve it. The mood of the masses gradually rose and they organized a committee to clear out the spoils. After the strength of the masses was demonstrated, Tian Xianzhong confessed his mistakes to the masses. At this time, the saboteur Song Baokui actively tried to use this opportunity to attack the village cadres and wanted to detain Tian Xianzhong. The leadership guided the masses to launch a discussion. The masses said: "Tian Xianzhong has done a lot of things for us and put in a lot of effort. It is really unreasonable to detain him." Song Baokui's conspiracy failed, and everyone unanimously agreed to let Tian Xianzhong compensate 40,000 yuan. After Tian Xianzhong returned the embezzled funds, he felt that the masses were lenient towards him, and his work became active again. He kept saying to everyone, "I will definitely follow everyone's opinions and work for everyone in the future." Seeing his honest confession, the masses re-elected him as the chairman of the Farmers' Association.

　　坦白认错退出自私果实
    田献忠重任农会主任
    【本报冀南二十三日电】永智范为庄农会主任田献忠退出贪污果实后，重新积极工作，群众又重选他继续领导大家。范为庄群众大动后，农会主任李耀华作风很硬，领导上把他撤职，换上安保元，安保元也是如此，又撤职换成田献忠。田献忠是个雇工，在斗争地主中很积极，因缺乏民主监督，贫污斗争果实近十万元、米五百斤、花百余斤并和李耀华结合起来贪污腐化，群众大为不满，农会的大小会都开不成。翻身队到村后，发现以前单纯撤换是错误方式，只有走群众路线才能改造村干。便一面动员田献忠坦白反省，一面向群众提出有啥说啥，一定作主解决，群众情绪逐渐高涨，并组织起清理果实委员会。群众力量显示后，田献忠向群众坦白认错。此时破坏分子宋保魁积极活动，企图借此打击村干部，要把田献忠扣起来。领导上引导群众展开讨论，群众说：“田献忠给咱办了不少事，出力不小，把人家扣起来真说不过去。”宋保魁的阴谋失败了，大家一致意见让田献忠赔四万元。田献忠退出果实款后，感到群众对他宽大，工作又积极起来，他不断向大家说：“以后一定遵从大家意见，给大家办事。”群众见他坦白的好，又重选他为农会主任。
