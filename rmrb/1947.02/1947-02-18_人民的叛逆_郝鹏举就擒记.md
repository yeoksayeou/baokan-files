　　The People's Betrayal
　　The Capture of Hao Pengju
　　Xiao Ji
　　After a day and night of self-defense warfare by the People's Liberation Army against Hao Pengju's troops, Hao's forces had suffered heavy casualties. With only one regiment of troops, they desperately resisted from the three fortresses and fortifications in the village. However, the People's Liberation Army had already crossed the two hundred meters of open ground from the south and southeast and突進去了. Hao's troops attempted to break through from the west but were intercepted. Some fled, while others retreated back to Wang River. In the face of the People's Liberation Army, the fighting will of Hao's officers and soldiers had been completely lost.
　　Battalion Commander Peng led his troops突進了 to the front and encountered personnel sent by Hao Pengju to surrender.
　　When Battalion Commander Ji Peng walked into the alley of Hao's headquarters, the guns and cannons in the courtyard were still in firing positions.
　　Hao Pengju, disguised in civilian clothes and bareheaded, sat on a pile of straw in the main room, his face ashen and lifeless. Seeing Battalion Commander Peng arrive, he stood up and said, "You've worked hard. I said it long ago… it's all my fault."
　　At that time, Hao issued an order to disarm and surrender. Thus, Chiang Kai-shek's 42nd Army Corps Headquarters was completely annihilated.
　　This happened at dusk on February 7th.
　　That night, Hao Pengju was escorted to the forward command post of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Hao sat silently on a low stool, reaching out his hands to the stove to warm himself, his face ashen and lifeless, his eyelids somewhat red and swollen. The look of shame and cowardice added to his fatigue.
　　"I take all the responsibility," Hao Pengju repeated like a confession: "All the responsibility should be borne by me… The Liberation Army treats the farmers and me very well, both politically and materially better than the Kuomintang. I fell for Chiang Kai-shek's诱惑, I am sorry to the people in the liberated areas, I am sorry to my officers and soldiers, and I am sorry to myself." His voice was slow. He smoked a cigarette, touching his shaved mouth and large jaw. After a long time, he sighed softly, "Alas!… Now… nothing can be said."
　　Now, what else can Hao Pengju say in the face of justice?

　　人民的叛逆
    郝鹏举就擒记
    嚣基
    人民解放军对郝鹏举部的自卫战，经一昼夜的战斗，郝部已伤亡惨重，仅以一个团的兵力凭借着庄上的三个堡垒和工事绝望的抗击着，然而人民解放军已从南面和东南面越过二百米的开阔地突进去了。郝军企图从西面突围却又被截击，一部溃窜，一部又向王河逃回，在人民解放军的面前，郝部官兵的战斗意志已丧失殆尽。
    彭营长率部突进了前头，迎面碰到郝鹏举派来求降的人员。
    冀彭营长走进郝军总部的小巷的时候，院子里的枪炮仍然放在射击的位置上。
    郝鹏举化装穿着老百姓的便衣，光着头，坐在堂屋内的草堆上，脸色灰暗无光。见彭营长来了，站起来说道：“你们辛苦了，我早说……都是我的不对。”
    当时，郝下了缴械投降的命令。于是，蒋介石的第四十二军团军总司令部便从此歼灭了。
    这是二月七日黄昏的事情。
    当天晚上，郝鹏举则被押抵人民解放军某部前线指挥所。郝默默地坐在一个矮凳子上，把手伸向火炉边取暖，脸色灰暗无光，眼皮有些红肿，羞愧和懦弱的神情又增加了他的疲惫。
    “一切责任由我负”，郝鹏举像忏悔一般重复着：“所有的责任应该由我负……解放军对农民对我很好，无论政治上物质上都比国民党好。我上了蒋介石的诱惑的当，我对不起解放区老百姓，我对不起我的官兵，也对不起自己。”他的声音慢吞吞地。他吸着纸烟，摸着剃光了胡子的嘴巴硕大的下颚。良久，他轻声慨叹道：“唉！……现在……什么也不能说了。”
    现在，郝鹏举在正义的面前还有什么可说的呢？
