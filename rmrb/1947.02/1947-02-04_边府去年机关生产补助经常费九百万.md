　　Border Region Government's Last Year's Nine Million Subsidy for Agency Production Operating Expenses
　　[This newspaper's report] Last year, the Border Region Government's agency production subsidized 70% of the year's operating expenses. The total expenditure for the year was over 13,910,000 yuan, with only over 4,210,000 yuan reimbursed, and the agency subsidy amounted to 9,690,000 yuan. The completion of this task was primarily due to commerce, followed by transportation and various productions directly led by the Management Section. Commerce generated a net profit of over 7,000,000 yuan for the year, transportation 1,700,000 yuan, and various productions under the Management Section over 4,000,000 yuan. The Management Section gained two experiences in directly leading various productions: first, considering both public and private interests, which boosted the production enthusiasm of cadres; second, precise calculation and meticulous organization. Under the principle of considering both public and private interests, various profit-sharing systems such as "20-80" and "30-70" were implemented. For example, the tofu workshop of the cooking squad and the flour milling of the feeding squad, two sayings expressed their high enthusiasm: "In the tofu workshop, the bellows sound before dawn; at the milling place, the sound of foot baskets is still heard in the middle of the night." In terms of precise calculation, for example, in charcoal for heating, organizing their own charcoal kiln not only saved manpower and animal power but also ensured heating. In terms of transportation, after changing the agency's livestock to a transportation team last April, a vehicle and horse allowance was implemented. This was also beneficial to both public and private interests. In terms of financial expenditure, such as the issuance of rations and fodder for people and horses, it was about 240,000 yuan per month (calculated based on last winter's prices); the average monthly reimbursement for vehicle and horse fees was only over 100,000 yuan. In terms of organization and leadership, for example, when sending people out to purchase, they were not simply assigned a single task but were given more money to buy whatever was cheap. Wang Qingzhou, a procurement officer of the Management Section, earned an extra profit of 200,000 yuan in the nine months from April to the end of the year, in addition to completing the assigned tasks. In terms of cadres' spare-time production, the total annual income was over 1,000,000 yuan.
    Recently, all workers and miscellaneous personnel are actively engaged in production and thrift to strive for the victory of the self-defense war. (Pei Zhi)

　　边府去年机关生产补助经常费九百万
    【本报讯】去年一年边府机关生产，补助了全年经常费开支的百分之七十。全年共开支一千三百九十一万余元，报销数仅四百二十一万余元，机关补助数则为九百六十九万元。这种任务的完成，首先是商业，其次是运输与管理科直接领导之各种生产。商业全年纯利七百余万元，运输为一百七十万元，管理科各种生产为四百余万元。管理科直接领导各种生产所得经验有二：第一是公私兼顾，提高了干部生产情绪。第二是精确计算，细密组织。在公私兼顾原则下。实行了“二八”“三七”各种分红制，例如炊事班的豆腐房，饲养班的磨面，有两句话表现其情绪之高：“豆腐房、五更未到风匣响；磨面处、半夜犹闻脚箩声。”在精确计算上，例如烤火木炭，自己组织木炭窖不但省了人力、畜力同时对烤火也有了保证。在运输方面，去年四月改机关牲口为运输队后，实行了发车马费。这样一来，也是公私两利。在财厅开支方面，如发人、马给养、草料等，每月约在二十四万上下（按去冬物价折算）；报车马费每月平均不过十几万元。在组织领导上，例如派人出外采购，不单纯指定一个任务，多带一些钱，遇见啥便宜就买啥。管理科采购员王青州自四月至年底九个月中，除完成指定任务外，获得额外利润二十万元。在干部业余生产上，全年共收入一百余万元。
    最近各工杂人员，正积极进行生产节约，以争取自卫战的胜利。（培智）
