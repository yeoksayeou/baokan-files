    Discussion on Several Specific Issues in the Land Leveling Movement
    Ding Kun

    The land leveling and gap-filling movement is being carried out enthusiastically in various areas of the border region (both new and old areas). Many areas are already coming to an end. A lot of experience has been created in the specific implementation of this policy. Here, I would like to raise a few points that I have recognized for discussion with everyone.

    The first issue is that thoroughly eliminating feudal exploitation and realizing "land to the tiller" requires an extremely arduous struggle. One or even several mass (not package-deal) struggles cannot solve the problem. We must carry out repeated mass inspections and repeated mobilization (enlightening the masses' awareness) to achieve the goal. This has been an important lesson learned in the movements in Taihang, Ji'nan, and other places: The rent reduction movement in Pingshun (an old area of Taihang) in 1944 was done very well, creating experience in enlightening the masses' awareness ideologically, earnestly completing rent and interest reduction, and mobilizing 82% of the villages. However, in this land leveling and gap-filling movement (they call it "cutting off the tail and filling the loopholes"), it was discovered that many cadres were shielding landlords. In Shangwujing Village, even 70 mu of illegally possessed land by landlords was found. In Nanweiquan Village, Licheng, 18 peasant households (including cadres and honorary soldiers) were found to be hiding land, livestock, and property for landlords within two days. After an inspection in Ji County, it was believed that there were no problems. However, after another in-depth inspection, it was discovered that even in two advanced villages, there were landlords whose land had not been weakened at all, with landlords owning an average of 29 mu of land per person, while the desperately poor owned only 1.8 mu on average. ... There are too many similar examples. Analyzing the reasons, there are mainly the following three points: (1) From the perspective of the old areas of Taihang, in the past rent reduction and inspection movements, after a major mobilization, the focus was placed on inspecting policies, carrying out ideological education, and rectifying the organization ... while neglecting to continue to mobilize the "backward" to thoroughly pursue landlords, thus giving the landlords loopholes. (2) After the masses are greatly mobilized, cadres are extremely prone to complacency. This seems to be a rule. The leadership should pay close attention to this point and use concrete facts to break complacency in order to seek further in-depth work. (3) We still leave many loopholes for landlords during the major mobilization, such as the failure to fully mobilize backward masses, problems in the cadre's work style—selfishness, excessive distribution of fruits, harming the interests of middle peasants and causing fear among middle peasants, etc.; these all leave the landlords with hidden nests in the economic and political spheres. This proves that without closely following the major mobilization with in-depth and repeated inspections, it is difficult to eliminate landlords, and it is difficult for peasants to thoroughly turn themselves over. This point seems to be no longer a problem in various places, but there may still be differences in the degree of understanding, and there is still a need to raise it again for research.

    The second issue is that only by earnestly starting with ideological mobilization, facing the backward and facing the impoverished unliberated peasants, can we truly find the feudal vestiges. The constitution of Wu'an is called "checking classes" (checking whether poor peasants are liberated and whether landlords are overthrown). I think it is very good. Facts have proven that the distance between poor and backward peasants and cadres is very large; the cadres of Majiu in Zuoquan said: "Backward people did not become backward in a day or two." "Mobilizing backward masses is a waste of work." In addition, the landlords sabotage from within: "When the cadres distributed things, they didn't let you speak. Now that there's no profit, they're asking you to stir up trouble." This statement can easily hit the hearts of backward peasants, and cadres often use this as a basis for the inability to mobilize backward masses. Based on this kind of thinking, when the higher-ups give him the task of filling the gaps and continuing to inspect feudalism, it is easy to simply focus his eyes on inside information and relax the landlord who is truly hiding his tail. The experience of Pingshun is that: all those who rely solely on cadres to get inside information have taken detours, and those who truly face the backward and pay attention to ideological mobilization have found the feudal tail and can more easily get the landlord to take out the inside information. From this, it can be proven that only when all the peasants are separated from the landlords ideologically, economically, and politically can we talk about truly eliminating the feudal exploitation of the landlords.

    The third issue is that: cadres must contribute the fruits of excessive distribution. Solving this problem has two important meanings: First, it can consolidate the unity between cadres and the masses. This issue has been troubling the old areas of Taihang for several years (other areas have the same situation). At first, it was simply about attacking cadres and opposing "new nobles." Later, it was the principle of "cherishing the history of valuable cadres and also cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses" and carrying out self-criticism by cadres to inspect their work style, which played a great role, but it did not achieve a complete solution. This year, Pingshun pointed out during the gap-filling that the cadres' excessive gains are one of the important reasons for the estrangement between cadres and the masses, which can be regarded as grasping the root cause of the problem. As a mass in Xiguan, Zuoquan, said: "We rely on you wholeheartedly to do things, but we didn't expect that this time (embezzling fruits) would put a layer of numbness in everyone's hearts. You guard against me, I guess at you, and we're not of one mind anymore, so bad people will take advantage of the loopholes." The experience of many places proves that: when cadres automatically issue over-distributed fruits, the relationship between cadres and the masses will immediately improve. Second, it can ensure the complete liberation of the desperately poor peasants. According to a survey of land distribution in eight typical villages in the new area of Taihang: In the four villages where land is most concentrated, as long as the landlords and those managing the landlords' land take out four-fifths, each poor peasant can be filled up to three mu of land (equivalent to the level of middle peasants in the village). According to a survey of four villages in the plains area where land is dispersed, after the landlords take out four-fifths of the land, each poor peasant can be filled up to two mu of land (the local middle peasants average three mu and four points of land per person). However, this does not calculate the feudal weakening part of the rich peasants. If this part is added in (the latter type of village has an average of six mu of land per rich peasant), the poor peasants' land can be largely resolved. But it can be seen here that in general villages (except for particularly poor villages), as long as the fruits are distributed fairly and reasonably, poor peasants can obtain land and seek liberation. However, we should understand that it is not easy to carry out this work. Cadres must be truly ideologically conscious, otherwise it is easy to form a splash of cold water. However, in order to thoroughly complete the gap-filling, good cadres and good party members must take the lead in setting an example and promote all cadres, militiamen, and activists to automatically return the excessively distributed fruits.

    In general, I think there is a basic idea that must be clarified, that is, when the movement enters the stage of in-depth inspection and completion of gap-filling, we must earnestly and practically mobilize all peasants to thoroughly and repeatedly investigate the hidden property of feudal landlords, and we must achieve the unity of all peasants (including the relationship between cadres and the masses), without leaving any economic or political loopholes for the landlords. Only in this way can we be considered to have achieved the goal of peasants turning themselves over and completely eliminating feudal exploitation.

### 填补运动中几个具体问题的商榷

    填补运动中
    几个具体问题的商榷
    丁昆
    填平补齐运动，在边区各地（无论新区老区）都开展得很热烈，有不少地区已走向结束，在这一方针的具体执行上创造了很多经验，这里仅就我个人所认识到的几点，提出来和大家商讨。
    第一个问题是彻底消灭封建剥削，实现耕者有其田，要经过一个极艰苦的斗争过程，一次甚至几次群众性（不是包办代替）的斗争还不能解决问题，而必须开展群众性的反复检查、反复发动（启发群众觉悟）才能达到目的。这在太行、冀南等地运动中都曾得到重要的启示：平顺（太行老区）四四年的查减运动做得很不坏，创造了从思想上启发群众觉悟的经验，认真完成减租减息，发动了群众的村庄达百分之八十二。但在此次填平补齐运动中（他们叫做割尾巴填窟窿）。竟发现不少干部包庇地主，上五井村甚至还查出地主黑地七十多亩。黎城南委泉村两天内查出十八户农民（包括干部及荣誉军人）为地主隐藏土地牲口财物等。冀县经过一度检查认为没问题了，但再次深入检查，竟在两个先进村中发现尚有一亩地也未被削弱的地主，地主土地有的平均到每人二十九亩，而赤贫则每人只平均到一亩八分。……………类此的例子太多了。分析原因，主要有如下三点：（一）从太行老区的情况看，过去历次减租及查减运动，都是在大动一过就把重点放在检查政策、进行思想教育、整顿组织……………而忽视继续发动“落后”彻底追查地主，因而给了地主空子。（二）群众大动起来之后，干部极易自满，这似乎已经是一个规律，领导上应切实注意此点，用具体事实打破自满，才能求得进一步的深入。（三）大动中我们还留给地主的空子很多，如落后群众未能全部发动，干部作风上的毛病——自私、多分果实，损害中农利益引起中农恐惧等；这都给地主在经济上政治上留下隐蔽的巢穴。从此证明，不紧跟着大动过后进行深入的反复检查，地主是很难消灭的，农民是很难翻透身的。这点在各地似乎已不成问题，但在认识的程度上恐怕还有差别，还有再次提出研究的必要。
    第二个问题是只有认真从思想发动入手，面向落后、面向贫苦的未翻身农民，才能真正查出封建尾巴。武安的宪法叫做查阶级（查贫苦农民是否翻身，地主是否斗垮）。我认为很好。事实证明，贫苦的落后农民与干部之间的距离是很大的；左权马厩的干部说：“落后人不是一天两日才落后了的。”“发动落后群众是白误工。”再加上地主的从中破坏：“干部们分东西的时候，不让你们说话，现在没油水了，叫你们瞎惹人。”这话很能打中落后农民的心坎，而干部也往往以此做为落后群众不能发动的根据，以这种思想做基础，当上级给了他填平补齐继续检查封建的任务后，就很容易单纯的把眼睛放在内货上，而放松了地主真正隐藏着尾巴。平顺的经验是：凡单纯靠干部搞内货的都走了弯路，真正面向落后注意思想发动的都找到了封建尾巴，也能比较容易的让地主拿出内货。从这里可以证明，只有全体农民从思想上经济上政治上与地主分了家，才能谈得上真正消灭地主的封建剥削。
    第三个问题是：干部必须献出多分果实。解决这个问题有两个重要意义，第一是可以巩固干部与群众间的团结，太行老区对这个问题闹了好几年了（其他地区也有同样情形），起初是单纯打击干部，反“新贵”，后来是“宝贵干部历史又宝贵群众热情”的原则，开展干部自我批评，检查作风，起了很大作用，但并未求得完全解决。今年平顺填补，提出干部多得果实是干、群关系隔阂的重要原因之一，算是抓到了病根，也正如左权西关一个群众说的：“咱们全心靠你们办事，不想你们这一来（贪污果实）就给大家心里垫了一层麻，你防我，我猜你，不一心啦，坏人就会钻空子。”许多地方经验证明：当干部自动发出多分果实后，干群关系马上就会好起来。第二是可以保证赤贫贫农的彻底翻身。据太行新区八个典型村土地分配的调查：在土地最集中的四个村，地主及经营地主的土地只要拿出五分之四来，每个贫雇农就能补齐到三亩地（相当于本村中农的水平）。另据土地分散的平原地区的四个村调查，当地主拿出五分之四的土地后，贫雇农每人能补齐到二亩地（当地中农每人平均地三亩四分）。但这里未计算富农的属于封建性的削弱部分，如果把这一部分加进去（后一种村富农每人平均地六亩），贫雇农土地是可以得到大体解决的。但这里可以看出，在一般村庄（特殊贫苦村例外），只要果实分配得公平合理，贫雇农民是可以获得土地，求得翻身的。不过我们应该了解，进行这个工作很不容易，必须是干部真正思想自觉，否则容易形成泼冷水，但为了彻底完成填补，好干部、好党员，必须带头起模范，推动所有干部民兵积极分子，自动的把多得果实退出来。
    总起来讲，我觉得有一个基本思想必需明确，这就是说当运动进入深入检查完成填平补齐阶段，要切切实实做到发动全体农民彻底的反复的清查封建地主隐蔽财产，要做到全体农民的团结（包括干群关系在内），不给地主经济上政治上留一点空隙。只有这样才能算是达到农民翻身，完全消灭封建剥削的目的。
