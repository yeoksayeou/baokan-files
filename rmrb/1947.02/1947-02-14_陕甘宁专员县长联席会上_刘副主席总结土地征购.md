    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Commissioner and County Head Joint Meeting
    Liu, Vice-Chairman, Summarizes Land Requisition
    I. It is necessary to mobilize the masses from the bottom up.
    II. Boldly revise the draft plan based on the situation.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th] At the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Commissioner and County Head Joint Meeting, Vice-Chairman Liu Jingfan summarized the Wangjia Yuan requisition in Qingyang County: First, it is necessary to mobilize the masses from the bottom up. This is the only way to achieve fairness and reasonableness, unite the masses, and avoid the phenomenon of "bestowal." Second, boldly revise the initial draft of land requisition based on the actual situation and the opinions of the broad masses, so that poor farmers can generally obtain land with roughly equal quantity and quality. For example, Article 11 of the Requisition Regulations stipulates: "Requisition is only based on the current cultivated land." Therefore, some tenant farmers and poor hired laborers did not receive land. After the land requisition in Xinbao Township, 55% of the farmers were still landless or had little land, and did not receive land. Based on these circumstances, the original Article 11 will be revised to "Those who have more cultivated land than the average land obtained by general farmers can have part of their land requisitioned and given to those who are landless or have little land." Third, thoroughly solving the land problem is the key to promoting all work. The experience of five townships proves that thoroughly solving the land problem not only aroused the masses' enthusiasm for self-defense and production, but also transformed and improved the rural government and mass organizations, and developed and strengthened the rural party organization.

    刘副主席总结土地征购
    一、必须自下而上发动群众
    二、根据情况大胆修正草案              
    【新华社延安九日电】陕甘宁边区专员县长联席会上，刘景范副主席总结庆阳县王家塬征购称：第一、必须自下而上发动群众，这样才能公平合理，团结群众，以避免“恩赐”的现象。第二、按照实际情况与广大群众的意见，大胆的修正征购土地的初步草案，以使贫苦农民普遍获得土地，数量质量大体平均，如征购条例第十一条规定：“只以现耕地为基础来征购”，因而若干佃户及贫雇农均未得到土地。新堡三乡征购土地后，还有百分之五十五无地或少地农民、未得到土地。根据这些情况，即将原第十一条修改为“现耕之地超过一般农民得地之平均数者，可征购一部给无地或少地者。”第三、彻底解决土地问题，是推动一切工作的关键，根据五个乡的经验证明：解决土地彻题，不只激起了群众自卫与生产热情，而且由此改造和健全了乡村政权与群众组织，发展和加强了农村党的组织。
