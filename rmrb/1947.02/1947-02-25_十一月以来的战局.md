　　The Battle Situation Since November

　　November was the month when the Chiang army's offensive began to shift, when the People's Liberation Army began to move to the initiative, when Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis began to arrive, and when the battle situation began to change. This newspaper has already made a detailed analysis in the editorial on December 5th.

　　Chiang Kai-shek did not realize the arrival of his military crisis until after the opening of Chiang's "National Assembly," that is, in late November. As for some of his subordinates, they were even more foolish than Chiang Kai-shek; Chen Cheng only lamented his misfortune in January. When Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates realized their military crisis, they tried to struggle to escape this military crisis. For this reason, they used many political and military methods.

　　Political methods. The first was that Chiang Kai-shek advised his subordinates not to pass the openly fascist and dictatorial Five-Five Constitution draft at the "National Assembly," but to pass a more concealed fascist and dictatorial constitution draft, namely the current Chiang-style pseudo-constitution. At 4:00 PM on November 27th, Chiang Kai-shek summoned Kuomintang "National Assembly" representatives to the "Lishi Society" in Nanjing and told them to do so. Chiang Kai-shek said: "This revision of the constitution draft is to fight the Communist Party." "Now is the critical moment for the survival of our party. If everyone listens to me, there is a future; otherwise, it's over!" "We cannot insist on the Five-Five Constitution draft; we must pass the government-revised constitution draft. This is our general retreat, and the general retreat is for taking the offensive." "I am unwilling to say 'retreat'; everyone's disregard for reality and unclear strategy has forced me to say this. These words must not be spoken to outsiders."

　　The second political method was the "peace talks" that Chiang Kai-shek trumpeted in January. The purpose of this "peace talk" was to implement the so-called "on-the-spot ceasefire" in order to consolidate the occupied areas, reorganize troops, obtain new American loans, and then launch a large-scale offensive to completely eliminate the People's Liberation Army and the national democratic movement.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's military method to save the crisis was to relax secondary battlefields and concentrate forces on the main battlefield in order to restore his offensive. Since mid-December, Chiang Kai-shek has implemented this method twice.

　　The first time was from mid-December to mid-January. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's strategy was to concentrate forces to attack northern Jiangsu. For this purpose, he transferred the reorganized 44th Division, the reorganized 64th Division, and the reorganized 20th Division, a total of three divisions, to the East China battlefield; he also transferred Chen Cheng's direct line, the reorganized 11th Division, from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield to the East China battlefield; then he transferred the reorganized 70th Division from Taiwan to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield to replace the reorganized 11th Division. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek transferred four divisions to the East China battlefield. Chiang Kai-shek's deployment to attack Shuyang in northern Jiangsu was to have the reorganized 11th Division, the reorganized 69th Division, and other two divisions (or armies) attack from the west, and the reorganized 74th Division, the reorganized 7th Division, and other two divisions (or armies) attack from the south, while the 51st Division, the 52nd Division, the 77th Division, and the 59th Division advanced from the Dongtai line to Linyi for coordination. From mid-December to mid-January, our Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu launched a counterattack, cleanly eliminating the headquarters and three and a half brigades of the reorganized 69th Division of the Chiang army, and cleanly eliminating its reorganized 26th Division, reorganized 51st Division, and the First Rapid Column, and part of the reorganized 52nd Division in the southern Shandong area, achieving a great victory. Our People's Liberation Army also achieved many victories on other battlefields. In January, it achieved an unprecedented record of annihilating twelve brigades of the enemy. Statistically, in the operations from November to January, our People's Liberation Army annihilated twenty-four brigades of the Chiang army, averaging still eight brigades per month. In terms of gains and losses of cities, from November to January, the Chiang army occupied fifty-five cities, and our army liberated fifty-four cities. That is to say, the Chiang army only occupied one city in three months.

　　After the defeat in January, Chen Cheng, who was even more foolish than Chiang Kai-shek, also became anxious. Of course, Chiang Kai-shek himself became even more anxious. Therefore, Chen Cheng, Chiang Kai-shek, Zhou Zhirou, and others personally went to Xuzhou to arrange a new offensive in an attempt to reverse the deepened crisis. However, their method of saving the crisis was no other than to concentrate their forces even more on one main battlefield, thus further relaxing other battlefields and making the rear even more empty. This is the current Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against Linyi.

　　Chiang Kai-shek used all his strength for the offensive against Linyi. In terms of mobilized forces, the Chiang army attacking northward along the Xuzhou-Haizhou section of the Longhai Railway consisted of twenty-three brigades and forty-eight regiments, of which thirty-nine regiments were concentrated on the eighty-mile front of Linyi, and twenty regiments were in the second-line troops south and west of Linyi, and twenty-four regiments were attacking Linyi from the Jiaoji Railway in the north; the total strength of the Chiang army attacking Linyi from the north and south amounted to seventy-two regiments. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng also transferred the 9th Army and the reorganized 75th Division, the reorganized 85th Division from the southern Hebei and northern Henan battlefields, and the reorganized 72nd Division from the Wuhan Headquarters to the western Shandong battlefield for coordination with southern Shandong. Such a concentration of forces was the largest and unprecedented in this civil war. Precisely because of this, it is also likely to be the last time. That is to say, even if the People's Liberation Army crushes this offensive, Chiang Kai-shek may still be able to transfer forces to concentrate on attacking a certain point, but it will be very difficult to concentrate forces like this time.

　　The reason why Chiang Kai-shek must concentrate his forces to such a high degree is not because he is still very strong. By the end of January, his regular army had been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army to the extent of fifty-six brigades. The large numbers of puppet troops and security forces annihilated by us have not been included in the calculation. The reason why he must concentrate to such a high degree is, on the one hand, because of low morale, which is not enough to embolden him; on the other hand, because he vainly attempts to seek battle forward and annihilate the living forces of our Liberation Army. The Chiang army is extremely afraid of the power of the People's Liberation Army; therefore, even with such a concentration of forces, it still does not dare to rush into Linyi. It took the entire Chiang army half a month to reach Linyi for one hundred sixty Chinese miles, averaging only a little more than ten Chinese miles per day. This tortoise speed shows the degree of the Chiang army's fear.

　　Is the Chiang army's occupation of Linyi a military victory or a defeat for Chiang Kai-shek? We say that it is not his victory, but a defeat. The reason why it is not a victory is that what he got was an empty city, and he did not find the main force of the People's Liberation Army at all. The reason why it is a defeat is that after his concentrated forces strike emptiness, they will be forced to disperse again, and this dispersion will send all the previous hard work to the east, losing his local advantage. If he does not disperse and stays in the Linyi area, he cannot solve any problems. Will our warmongering "hero" not lament his "misfortune" again!? In short, this is called "being in a dilemma." Chiang Kai-shek is now in a difficult situation of "being in a dilemma" in military, political, and economic terms.

　　On the side of the People's Liberation Army, the situation is completely opposite. When the Chiang army concentrates to a high degree in one place, first, on other battlefields, second, in other aspects of this battlefield, and third, in certain sections of this front line (such as the section held by Hao Pengju's rebel army on the flank of the offensive against Linyi), it leaves more gaps. In these places, it is easier for the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy in large numbers. Before the Chiang army arrived in Linyi, the People's Liberation Army had already eliminated Hao Pengju's rebel army; after the Chiang army occupied Linyi, more good news will be spread, and it will inevitably continue to come.

　　In short, since November, the battle situation has changed from a situation of Chiang's advance and our retreat to a situation of seesaw-like advance and retreat. This is a basic change in the battle situation since November. What Chiang Kai-shek hopes is to return from this seesaw-like situation to the situation before November, but this is forever impossible; this is just Chiang Kai-shek's delusion. In the future, one possibility is that this seesaw-like situation will continue for a period of time, and the other is that this situation will turn into a situation of the People's Liberation Army steadily advancing and recovering lost territory. When the Chiang army increasingly concentrates its forces in one place, and the People's Liberation Army continues to annihilate the Chiang army in large numbers, the Chiang army's positions will change from surfaces to lines, from lines to points, and the Chiang army's initiative will change from total to partial, then from the majority of partial to the minority of partial, and then from the initiative of the minority of partial to no initiative. Every time Chiang Kai-shek concentrates his forces, it means that their front is further disintegrating. No matter how Chiang Kai-shek struggles, he cannot escape this law. The decisive factor in the battle situation is nothing else but the ebb and flow of living forces, including the ebb and flow of military strength and soldiers. With the People's Liberation Army continuing to annihilate the Chiang army in large numbers, further changes in the battle situation are inevitable. The task of all the commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army is to continue to eliminate the living forces of the Chiang army in order to strive for the further changes in the battle situation to arrive faster.

### 十一月以来的战局

专栏：解放日报社论

　　十一月以来的战局
    十一月是蒋军攻势开始转变的月份，是人民解放军开始转入主动的月份，是蒋介石军事危机开始到来的月份，是战局开始变动的月份。本报在十二月五日的社论中，已经作了详细的分析。
    蒋介石对于自己的军事危机的到来，是到了蒋记“国大”开幕以后，即十一月下旬才意识到的。至于他的某些部下，是比蒋介石更蠢些，陈诚到了一月才自叹命苦。当蒋介石及其部下意识到他们的军事危机的时候，他们就企图挣扎，来逃脱这个军事危机。为此，就用了政治上、军事上的许多办法。
    政治上的办法。第一是蒋介石劝戒其部属不要在“国民大会”上通过公开法西斯独裁的五五宪草，而通过一个比较隐蔽的法西斯独裁的宪草，即现在的蒋记伪宪。十一月二十七日下午四时，蒋介石在南京“励志社”召集国民党籍“国大”代表，告诫他们要这样做，蒋介石说：“这次修改宪草，就是为了打共产党。”“现在是本党的危急存亡关头，大家要听我的话，则有前途；否则，完了！”“我们不能坚持五五宪草，要通过政府修改的宪草，这是我们的总退却，总退却是为的采取攻势。”“退却我是不愿说出；大家这样忽视现实，不明策略，这种近视观念把我逼得不能不说了。这些话，绝对不能对外边人说。”
    第二个政治上的办法，就是一月间蒋介石所喧染的“和谈”。这个“和谈”的目的，就是要实行所谓“现地停战”，以便巩固侵占区，休整兵力，取得美国新借款，然后再来大举进攻，彻底消灭人民解放军与全国民主运动。
    蒋介石军事上挽救危机的办法，就是放松次要战场，集中兵力于主要战场，以恢复其攻势。从十二月中旬以来，蒋介石已两次实行这种办法。
    第一次是在十二月中旬到一月中旬，这时候蒋介石的方针是集中兵力进攻苏北。为此目的，他从后方调了整编第四十四师、整编第六十四师、整编第二十师，共三个师到华东战场；又从晋冀鲁豫战场抽调陈诚嫡系整编第十一师到华东战场；再从台湾调整编第七十师到晋冀鲁豫战场，代替整编第十一师。这样，蒋介石就向华东战场增调了四个师。蒋介石到苏北沭阳进攻的部署是以整编第十一师、整编第六十九师等两个师（即军）从西面进攻，以整编第七十四师、整编第七师等两个师（即军）从南面进攻，同时以五十一师、五十二师、七十七师、五十九师由东台线向临沂前进，以为配合。十二月中旬起至一月中旬，我陈毅、粟裕两将军所部展开反击，干净消灭蒋军之整编第六十九师师部及三个半旅，并在鲁南地区干净消灭其整编第二十六师、整编第五十一师及第一快速纵队，整编第五十二师一部，取得巨大胜利。我人民解放军在其他各战场亦取得许多胜利，一月份达到歼敌十二个旅的空前纪录。统计十一月份至一月份的作战中，我人民解放军歼灭蒋军二十四个旅，平均仍为每月八个旅。在城市的得失方面，十一月至一月蒋军侵占五十五城，我军解放五十四城，这就是说，蒋军在三个月中只占去了一个城。
    在一月失败之后，比蒋介石更蠢些的陈诚也发急了。当然，蒋介石自己更加发急。于是，就由陈诚、蒋介石、周至柔等亲自到徐州去布置新的进攻，以图挽回更加深重了的危机。而其挽救危机的办法，除了更加集中兵力于一个主要战场，因而更加放松其他战场和更使后方空击以外，再没有其他办法了。这就是此次蒋介石对临沂的进攻。
    蒋介石对于临沂的进攻，是用尽了一切力量的。以动员的兵力而言，在陇海路徐海段向北进攻的蒋军，为二十三个旅四十八个团，其中集中于临沂正面八十里的战线上就有三十九个团，在临沂以南及以西的第二线部队计有二十个团，在北面以胶济路向临沂进攻的有二十四个团；南北两面合计，蒋军进攻临沂的兵力共达七十二个团。此外，蒋介石、陈诚并将冀南、豫北战场的第九军与整七十五师、整八十五师及武汉行营的整七十二师调至鲁西战场，使与鲁南相配合。像这样的集中兵力，是此次内战中规模最大的空前的一次。正因为如此，它也很可能成为绝后的一次。就是说，如果人民解放军粉碎了此次进攻，蒋介石虽然还可能再抽调兵力集中进攻某一地点，但是决计很难像这次一样集中兵力了。
    蒋介石所以必须如此高度的集中兵力，并不是由于他还很强大。他的正规军被人民解放军歼灭的，至一月底止已达五十六个旅，他的伪军及保安部队被我歼灭的大数量还未算在内。他之所以必须如此高度集中，乃是一方面由于士气低落，非此不足以壮胆；另一方面因为他妄想向前求战，歼灭我解放军的有生力量。蒋军对于人民解放军的威力，是攫怕已极了的；所以即使集中了这样的兵力，仍不敢对临沂冒进，一百六十华里路，走了整整半个月才走到临沂，平均每天只走十华里多一点。此种乌龟速度，即表现了蒋军恐惧程度。
    蒋军占领临沂，对于蒋介石说来是军事上的胜利还是失败呢？我们说，这不是他的胜利，而是失败。其所以不是胜利，是因为他得到的乃是一座空城，根本没有找到人民解放军主力在什么地方。其所以是失败，是因为他集中起来的兵力扑空以后，又将被迫分散，这个分散就把以前的辛苦集中全付东流，要失掉他的局部优势。他如果不分散，呆在临沂地区，又不能解决任何问题。我们的好战“英雄”，岂不又要自叹“命苦”！？总而言之，这就叫做“进退维谷”，蒋介石不论在军事上、政治上、经济上，现在均已陷入“进退维谷”的苦境。
    在人民解放军方面，则情形完全相反。当蒋军越是高度集中于一地的时候，第一是在其他战场上，第二是在这一战场的其他方面，第三是在这一战线上的若干段（例如进攻临沂前线的侧冀上由郝鹏举叛军担任的一段），就都留出了更大空子。在这些地方，人民解放军就更容易大量歼灭敌人。在蒋军未到临沂以前，人民解放军已经消灭了郝鹏举叛军；在蒋军占了临沂之后，这种捷报就要更多的传来了，而且必将连续不断的传来。
    总之，从十一月起，战局已由蒋进我退的局面，变为拉锯式一进一退的局面，这是十一月以来战局的一个基本变化。蒋介石所希望的是从这种拉锯式的局面再回到十一月以前的局面去，但这永远是不可能的了，这只是蒋介石的妄想罢了。今后，可能的一种是这样拉锯式的局面再会继续一个时期，另一种是这样的局面转变为人民解放军稳步前进，收复失地的局面。当蒋军越来越集中其兵力于一地，而人民解放军又继续大量歼灭蒋军的时候，蒋军的阵地就由面而变为线，由线而变为点，蒋军的主动权由全部变为局部，再由多数局部变为少数局部，再由少数局部的主动权变为没有主动权。蒋介石每一次集中兵力，这意味着他们的阵线更进一步的瓦解。不管蒋介石如何挣扎，是逃不过这一规律的。战局的决定因素不是别的，仍是有生力量的消长，包括军力与士兵的消长。在人民解放军继续大量歼灭蒋军的情况之下，战局的进一步的变化是必然的了。人民解放军全体将士的任务，是继续消灭蒋军的有生力量，以争取战局的进一步的变化更快到来。（二月二十三日）
