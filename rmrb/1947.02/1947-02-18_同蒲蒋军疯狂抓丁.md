　　Kuomintang-Yan Xishan Troops in Tongpu Frenziedly Inducting Soldiers
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 16th] The Kuomintang-Yan Xishan troops in Tongpu are conscripting soldiers and engaging in burning and killing in the occupied areas and on the edges of our border areas, with methods even more vicious than the Japanese invaders. It is reported that Kuomintang troops in Wenxi are implementing a "Party, government, and military general mobilization" to frantically conscript soldiers. Young men from villages such as Luohe and Baisen in Pingyao were forcibly trained and incorporated into the 44th Division. Several thousand men in the 8th Column of the Kuomintang army in Xinjiang and a certain unit numbered 780 were all forcibly conscripted. In Houcun, over a hundred families were left with only a disabled youth after the conscription. Other villages were also mostly left with old men over forty-five years old and children under fifteen. A young man from Nanshu village cut off one of his feet to avoid being drafted, but was sentenced to five years in prison by the Yan puppet regime. Similar tragedies occur endlessly. Wealthy people are extorted one million yuan per person to buy someone to take their place. According to Yang Wentong, a new recruit from the puppet "Love the Village Corps" who fled to our area: "In order to prevent new recruits from escaping, the Kuomintang-Yan Xishan troops implement a disrupted organizational structure. New recruits are forbidden from talking in groups of two or three. New recruits must report "needing to relieve themselves" from inside their blankets in the middle of the night, otherwise they will be accused of desertion, captured, and shot.

　　同蒲蒋军疯狂抓丁
    【本报太岳十六日电】同蒲蒋阎在侵占区及我边沿区大肆抓兵和烧杀，手段之毒辣甚过日寇。闻喜蒋军实行“党政军总动员”疯狂抓丁。平遥罗鹤、柏森等村青年因被驱受训而编入四十四师。新绛蒋军八纵队与闻喜七八○某部数千余人全是抓去的。侯村有百余户人家，抓丁后只留下一个残废青年。其他村也尽是四十五岁以上的老汉和十五以下的儿童。南属村一青年把脚砍去一只，逃避编组，却被阎伪判了五年徒刑。类似的惨事层出不穷。有钱的每名要被勒索一百万元，买人顶替。据逃来我区之伪“爱乡团”新兵杨文通谈：“蒋阎军为避免新兵逃跑，实行打乱编制。禁止新兵两三人一块谈话，新兵半夜小便，必须在被子里报告“解手”，否则就以开小差论罪，抓回枪毙。
