　　[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 24th] The fruit distribution in Ningnan is closely combined with ideological education to raise awareness, and the masses are in very high spirits. The county's experience is: First, if we pay great attention to ideological education during the distribution of fruits, the ideological awareness of the masses will be further enhanced. For example, when the masses are most grateful to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we should compare Chairman Mao with gods, with Chiang Kai-shek, and with emperors. The masses listen with great interest, and the effect is enormous. For example, in Dongwang, during the celebration meeting, some kowtowed to Chairman Mao, some toasted Chairman Mao with wine pots, and some old ladies smashed their incense burners and tore up the god statues at home, and then hung up portraits of Chairman Mao. More than 2,000 households in Dongwang and more than 19,000 households of liberated farmers in the surrounding villages automatically abolished gods and invited Chairman Mao instead. At the same time, when distributing fruits, we must point out how they came about, how poor we were in the past, and burn the landlords' contracts at the meeting and issue new contracts, so that the masses' thoughts will be more consolidated. Second, when distributing fruits, we must take advantage of the masses' passionate emotions to carry out cultural entertainment, and the masses will revel when the fruits are in hand. For example, when Dongwang distributed land, 60-year-old He Laosuo put the new contract on his head and sang Hebei Bangzi opera, and middle peasant He Laojing shouted loudly while holding the distributed crude porcelain pot: "Although there is not much, this is something that has never happened before." He Erhai kept singing after getting the new contract, singing while eating, singing while walking, and singing while lying on the kang. His mother, who had been bedridden for a long time, got up excitedly when she saw the contract and said to her son, "I'm cured." The "Beat Old Chiang" song, the "Never Forget Chairman Mao After Liberation" song, and the "What is Good, What is Bad" song, which were automatically compiled by the masses in Dongwang and Dingcao, were all created at this time. Even old men and five or six-year-old children can sing a few songs. Zhang Jinping, a 70-year-old lady, can sing thirteen songs and even composed one herself. In terms of the way of distributing fruits, when land, houses, and floating wealth are returned to their owners, it is best to divide them into "three happy events entering the door" and immediately celebrate with gongs and drums. This will not only excite the masses and show strength, but also change the atmosphere in the countryside. At the same time, combine the armed defense of the fruits. For example, the militia in Dongwang has developed from more than 100 people to more than 350 people, all of whom were developed at the victory meeting. We must strive to promote democratic education when distributing fruits. The issue of fruits is related to everyone's interests, and this is the best time to carry out democracy. For example, Dongwang holds democratic meetings after each distribution of land, houses, and floating wealth. In the discussion of practical matters, the experience and understanding of democracy will be further enhanced, and the shortcomings of leadership can also be tested. The basic masses will not cause disunity due to the distribution of fruits.

### 宁南分果实中注意思想教育

　　宁南分果实中注意思想教育
    【本报冀南二十四日电】宁南分配果实，密切结合思想教育，提高觉悟：群众情绪非常高涨。该县经验是：一、分果实时要以高度的注意进行思想教育，群众的思想觉悟就会更加提高。如在群众对毛主席共产党感激最高的时候，即提出毛主席与神相比，与蒋介石相比，与皇帝相比，群众听的津津有味，效果极大。如东汪在开庆祝大会时，有的向毛主席磕头，有的提着酒壶向毛主席敬酒，有的老太太回到家里将香炉砸了，把神像撕了，随即挂起毛主席像。东汪两千多户及周围村的一万九千多户翻身农民均自动取消了神，换请了毛主席。同时分给果实时要提出是怎样来的，过去怎样的穷，今天要在大会上将地主文契烧掉，发给新文契，群众思想会更巩固。二、分果实时，要趁着群众火热的情绪开展文化娱乐，果实刚到手的当儿群众就会狂欢。比如东汪在分土地时，六十岁的贺老所将新文契顶到头上大唱梆子腔，中农贺老景提着分的粗磁壶大声说：“东西虽不多，这是开天立地没有的事。”贺二孩得到新文契后不停的唱，吃饭唱，走路唱，躺在炕上唱。他母亲久病卧床，见到文契兴奋的起来了，对他儿说：“我的病好了。”东汪、丁曹群众自动编的“打老蒋”歌、“翻身不忘毛主席”歌、“什么为好，为坏”歌，都是这个时候创作出来的，连老头们和五六岁的小孩都会唱几个歌子。七十岁的老太太张金平会唱十三个歌，自己还编了一个歌。在分果实的方式上，土地、房屋、浮财还家时，顶好分成“三喜进门”，并立即锣鼓喧天的进行庆祝，这样不但兴奋了群众，显示了力量，而且农村的空气也为之改观。同时把武装保卫果实结合起来，如东汪民兵由百多名发展到三百五十多名，都是在胜利会上发展的。分果实时必须努力推行民主教育，果实问题关系着每个人的利益，这是开展民主最好的时机。如东汪在每次分地、分房分浮财以后要召开民主会，在实际事的讨论中，对民主的体验和认识会越加提高，同时也能考验出领导上的毛病，基本群众也不会因分果实闹不团结。
