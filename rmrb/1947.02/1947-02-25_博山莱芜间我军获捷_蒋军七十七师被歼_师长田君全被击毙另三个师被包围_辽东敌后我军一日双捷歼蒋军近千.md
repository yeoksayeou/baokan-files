　　[Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, Urgent Telegram, 23rd] On the evening of the 20th, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army ambushed the 77th Division of the 73rd Army between Boshan and Laiwu, and by the morning of the 21st, it had completely annihilated it, and the Division Commander Tian Junquan was killed. On the night of the 21st, our army launched a full-scale counterattack on the Laiwu-Tusikou line. Two other divisions of the 73rd Army led by Chiang’s General Li Xianzhou and the New 36th Division of the 12th Army were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. The fighting was fierce, and all units had seizures. That night, the Chiang side's command ordered the reorganized 46th Division to move north toward Laiwu City in an attempt to have a decisive battle with us, but the army was ambushed along the way, and part of it was cut off, and the entire front line was shaken. Wang Yaowu ordered Li Xianzhou and Han Liancheng on the evening of the 21st to break through on the 22nd. Now the People's Liberation Army is dividing its forces to encircle and annihilate them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd] The Democratic Allied Army, active behind enemy lines in eastern Liaoning, achieved a double victory in one day, eliminating nearly 1,000 enemies. On the morning of the 21st, a unit of the army recovered the important stronghold of Jianchang, more than 50 kilometers southeast of Benxi, which was occupied by Chiang's army.
