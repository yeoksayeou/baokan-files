    Leprosy is Not Contagious
    Wang Kejin
    Leprosy has a history of more than two thousand years in China, and everyone is afraid of it being contagious. In society, children poison their parents who suffer from leprosy; in the past, Guangzhou was supported for shooting innocent people suffering from leprosy. The more civilized method in the world is only to drive patients to deserted islands. However, recent research by British doctors has found that although leprosy is severe, it is generally not easily contagious unless there are special factors. Some healthy people have lived with leprosy patients for twenty or thirty years without being infected. The children of leprosy patients are generally healthy and it is indeed considered non-hereditary.

    Therefore, medical experts advocate that leprosy patients should not be abandoned and should still be able to engage in labor and production. If patients are mentally happy, well-nourished, and pay attention to hygiene and recuperation, the symptoms can improve and even be cured.

    Regarding the treatment of leprosy, it has recently been proven that chaulmoogra oil is not very effective, and new sulfur-based preparations, comiu and Dizone, are indeed effective. Leprosy bacteria and tuberculosis bacteria have the same properties, and experiments are now being conducted using Streptoin-ycin (a newly invented special drug for tuberculosis) for treatment, which may be effective.

    麻疯病不传染
    王克锦
    麻疯病（癞病）在中国已有二千余年的历史，人人都怕它传染，社会上儿女毒死他们患麻疯病的父母；过去广州枪杀患麻疯的无罪的人，受人拥护。世界上文明一点的办法，也只是把患者驱入荒岛。但最近经英国医生研究，知道麻疯病虽然厉害，但是除非有特殊因素，一般人是不容易被传染的，有些健康人和麻疯病人共同生活二三十年，也未被感染。麻疯病的子女一般也都是健康人，确实认为不能遗传。
    因此医家主张，麻疯病人，不应被遗弃，同样能够劳动生产。病人如果精神愉快，营养佳良，注意卫生疗养，病症可以好转，以至痊愈。
    麻疯病的治疗，最近证明大枫子油效果不佳，用新复硫制剂。comiu和Dizone则效果确实。麻疯病菌和痨病菌性质相同，现正试验用辐射线菌素（Streptoin—ycin）（一种新发明的痨病特效药）治疗，或有效果。
