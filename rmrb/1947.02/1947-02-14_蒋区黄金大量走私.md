Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to Reuters, Associated Press, and the Central News Agency, gold smuggling has been rampant recently. On the 8th alone, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, flying from Shanghai, transported over 300 gold bars for a certain bank, which were being smuggled. The plane crashed west of Hankou. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company also transported 187 gold bars from Shanghai, which were seized on the 9th. The reason for the frequent smuggling is that gold prices in North China and Sichuan are even higher than in Shanghai, so speculative funds from all over are pouring into this speculative business.

    蒋区黄金
    大量走私
    【新华社延安十日电】据路透社、合众社及中央社消息：近日黄金走私之风甚炽，仅八日中航公司飞机由沪飞运替某银行载运走私金条三百余根，该机飞至汉口西部失事。南侨公司亦由沪运黄金一百八十七条，九日被查获。走私频繁之原因为华北及四川等地黄金涨价较沪尤烈，故各地游资纷纷投入此项投机生意。
