[This dispatch from] Taihang, 27th [of the month]: In the Chiang-occupied area of Anyang, people are suffering because Chiang Kai-shek's authorities impose heavy taxes and levies based on land area, to the point that "land has become a cancer for peasants." In Xiahe Village, the average levy is 50,000 yuan per mu, and in Xin'an Village, the average is over 67,000 yuan per person. Middle peasant Liu ××, with a family of four and ten mu of land, has already paid 300,000 yuan in levies. He cried and said, "The savings from when the Eighth Route Army was here are now completely gone!" In Beiguan, Shuizhi, thirty households were assigned thirty guns, at 600,000 yuan per gun. In Xujiagou, which fell [to the enemy] less than two months ago, 84,000 yuan was extracted for "repair fees," and 1,300 catties of rice for the "mentoubing" (armed groups from secret societies); each bao (group of households) had to provide four soldiers, at 2.5 million yuan per soldier. Beiliu Village has already paid 22 million yuan in "troop purchasing fees." Other groups, such as the puppet security forces and "Homecoming Legions," constantly demand firewood, grass, oil, and salt, extorting arbitrarily in countless ways. Puppet officials are rampant with corruption. "Commissioner" Zhao Shichen openly embezzled over 50 million yuan. The family fortune of Sun Yiqing, the Kuomintang secretary of Anyang County, has also increased to 100 million yuan. Liu Lexian, the puppet security regiment commander, made a fortune by embezzling "troop funds." Local people are unable to live and are fleeing their homes. In Xiabaishu Village alone, seven landlord families have fled to our liberated area. The Anyang Kuomintang's "Popular Daily" also said in an editorial on December 24th: "...The income per mu is only two or three dou for those with less, and four or five dou for those with more, while the levies imposed are over six dou per mu. Peasants are selling their wives and children, tearing down houses and selling roofs, and still cannot pay the grain taxes. Farmland has become a cancer for peasants.” The people are forced to resist, all saying, "We can't survive anyway!" Shen Furong and Shen Fuxi, primary school teachers from Zhang'erzhuang, who fled to the Liberated Area, said, "We have to take up arms and fight against the Kuomintang reactionaries. If we don't drive away the Central Army, there will be no good days for the rich or the poor."
