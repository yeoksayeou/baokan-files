Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 23rd: According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, the Kuomintang government's heavy taxes in various parts of Hebei have forced people to abandon their farmland and flee. This spring's plowing in eastern Hebei faces a major crisis because the endless requisitions for building bunkers, running "self-defense" programs, and purchasing arms and ammunition last year have forced farmers to sell even their plowing oxen. Tenant farmers find that even giving up all their agricultural products is not enough to cover the taxes.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 21st: According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao of the 9th of this month, as the financial and economic collapse of the Kuomintang government becomes increasingly serious, it has decided to increase the "comprehensive income tax." The tax will be levied on each household, deducting "necessary living expenses" and all types of classified income taxes already paid by the household during the year. The remaining income exceeding 600,000 yuan will be taxed at rates ranging from 5% to 50%.

　　河北蒋区捐税繁重人民抛弃耕地他逃
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据天津大公报报导，蒋政府统治之河北各地捐税繁重，人民纷纷抛弃耕地他逃，冀东今年春耕即有很大危机，因去年修碉堡办“自卫”购械弹等永无止境的摊派，农民连耕牛也都变卖，佃农拿出全部农产品也不够。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据本月九日津大公报载，蒋政府在财政经济的崩溃日益严重中已决定增征“综合所得税”，以每户为单位，每户全年中扣除家庭生活“必须费用”及每户征纳各类分类所得税后，其余额所得如超过六十万元者，即行调征税出百分之五至百分之五十。
