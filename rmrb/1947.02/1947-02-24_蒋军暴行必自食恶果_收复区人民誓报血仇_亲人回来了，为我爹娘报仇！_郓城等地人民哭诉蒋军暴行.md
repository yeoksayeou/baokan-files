　　Jiang's Army's Atrocities Will Inevitably Backfire
    People in Recovered Areas Vow to Avenge Blood Feuds
    "Our dear ones have returned, avenge my parents!"
    — People in Yuncheng and other places cry out against the atrocities of Jiang's army
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Front, February 21] This reporter followed the army to the recovered areas of Yuncheng, Puyang, and Juye. The people, with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, cheered the Eighth Route Army: "Our dear ones have returned! You really haven't forgotten us." They grabbed the hands of our comrades with tears in their eyes, recounting the humiliation and disasters they had suffered. In the west street of Yuncheng, four helpless orphans hugged the leg of an Eighth Route Army soldier, begging them to avenge their parents. Their father was beaten half to death and then buried alive by Jiang's army, and a pregnant mother was kicked to death by Jiang's army. The Sang Yihe family of Zhuo Village tried to protect their daughter from being raped by Jiang's army, and Jiang's army threw a bomb at them, killing or injuring all six members of the family. Liu Shangzhi's wife from Gao Village cried to the soldiers about the tragic situation of her eighteen-year-old daughter being gang-raped by Jiang's army. She said, "A little girl next door was also gang-raped by Jiang's army and bled to death." Old man Chen Baoshan grabbed the hands of the soldiers and said, "We've been waiting for you! The Central Army staying here for a few days is worse than three years of flooding." Zhao Yinsheng, an old man from Xiaoyuzhuang in Jinxiang who had just stood up, only returned home after hearing that the Eighth Route Army had arrived. He said to the soldiers, "Quickly recover the lost land! After you left for a few days, the bullies climbed back on the heads of the poor." When the villagers saw their own troops return, they boiled water and sent pork. They said, "If our dear ones had come any later, we wouldn't have been able to survive!" An old man who escaped from Jinxiang said to the soldiers, "If you want to attack Jinxiang, I'll lead the way. I know all the ditches and trenches there. The villagers in Jin Village are also eagerly waiting, hoping for comrades to rescue them!"
