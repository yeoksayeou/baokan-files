　　One Hundred Heads (Clapper Talk)
    By Li Mu

     Talking about heads, speaking of heads,
     On stage and off stage, all heads,
     Comrades sitting below the stage, heads,
     I am standing on the stage, head.
     Those willing to listen, lower your heads,
     Those willing to watch, raise your heads,
     Those unwilling to watch, turn your heads,
     Listen to me talk about traitorous heads:
     The grass radical above the character "jiang" (将),
     Two people standing are a stone (石头),
     Topping it is a bald head,
     He is the reactionary head of China.
     Eight years of the War of Resistance, playing tricks,
     Telling his troops to surrender to the enemy,
     He, as the warlord head of the whole country,
     Still wants to be a dictatorial head.
     Opposing communism and the people are at the forefront,
     Exploiting the people, the old rich man's head.
     Taking a plane to outside the Guān,
     Hurrying back inside the Guān.
     He is busy all day long,
     Bowing and kowtowing,
     Begging several American big foreign heads,
     To stand on China's head.
     He also gathered anti-communist military officer heads,
     Asking who is at the forefront of the civil war.
     The officers all lowered their heads,
     Knowing that fighting the Eighth Route Army is suffering,
     The Eighth Route Army has captured many big heads,
     So no one dares to go to the front.
     This made Chiang Kai-shek angry,
     Holding a pistol in his hand,
     If anyone doesn't go to the front for me,
     Will be dealt with according to military law and have your heads cut off.
     October 30th, the sun sets,
     Liu Ruzhen's troops advanced to the south of Juan City.
     General Liu Bocheng raised his head,
     Looked at the map and nodded,
     An order was passed down,
     The troops all turned their heads,
     The cadres led the way,
     No soldier wanted to be behind.
     After less than a dozen hours of fighting,
     Captured Liu Guangxin, the brigade commander head.
     Our First Company topped the front,
     Captured the regimental commander head of the 355th Regiment alive.
     A cook head came from behind to deliver food,
     Carrying a food bucket and bumped into the enemy.
     He dropped the food bucket and threw the grenade,
     Enemy officers are not even as good as cooks,
     Crawled on the ground and kowtowed,
     Afraid of having his head cut off.
     After this battle, the troops turned their heads,
     And immediately thrust into the enemy's heart.
     Shaoerzhai, the enemy's brigade commander head,
     Was arranging troops to defend the front,
     Who knew that the Eighth Route Army had reached his front,
     The main force of the Second Company attacked the east,
     The main force of the Third Company coordinated the attack on the west,
     There were a total of six or seven rocket heads,
     All kinds of artillery showed their mettle,
     Beating the enemy so they couldn't raise their heads.
     The heroes of the Second and Third Companies broke through the abatis and attacked over the outer moat,
     Climbing ladders and rushing into the village,
     Rice was transported for five hours,
     All transported into our pots.
     Five artillery pieces were pulled,
     All pulled into our ranks.
     Three hundred or more Sichuan mules and foreign horses were pulled,
     Complete with saddles and bridles,
     The officers lost their heads,
     The wives rode high horses,
     The little young masters were still biting nipples in their mother's arms,
     One by one, they were sent to the prisoner of war camps.
     In the Hancun annihilation battle, the bandit head Si Guan San was captured,
     In the Shangguan Village annihilation battle, two brigade commander heads were captured,
     These are the heads of the enemy from four brigades,
     Leaving only two empty fists,
     These two battles made the National Assembly less and less enthusiastic,
     The enemies attacking the Pinghan Line shrank their heads,
     The masses of Juancheng and Yuncheng raised their heads again,
     After the victory news spread,
     Everyone happily nodded their heads.
     Chiang Kai-shek,
     Turn your head,
     Look at the back of your head,
     The people of the whole country want to raise their heads,
     All are your mortal enemies,
     Tell you this stubborn head,
     If you insist on dictatorial traitorous civil war without turning back,
     Be careful with your stinking bones,
     Be careful with your stinking bones!

　　一百个头（快板）
    黎木作
     说个头、道个头，
     台上台下净人头，
     同志们坐在台下头，
     我是站在台上头。
     愿听的低下头，
     愿看的抬起头，
     不愿看的扭过头，
     听我来谈谈卖国头：
     将字上面草字头，
     二人站的是石头，
     顶着一颗光秃头，
     他是中国的反动头。
     八年抗战耍滑头，
     叫他的队伍把敌投，
     他身为全国的军阀头，
     他还想当个专制头。
     反共反人民在前头，
     剥削人民老财头。
     坐飞机到关外头，
     急忙又回到关里头。
     他一天到晚忙到头，
     又作揖来又磕头，
     请求几个美国大洋头，
     站在中国的头上头。
     他又召集反共军官头，
     问声内战那个在前头。
     军官们个个都低下头，
     明知打八路吃苦头，
     八路军捉过多少大头头，
     所以谁也不敢上前头。
     把蒋介石弄在气上头，
     手枪拿在手里头，
     谁要不给我上前头，
     要按军法从事杀你们头。
     十月三十号太阳落山头，
     刘汝珍部队进至鄄城城南头。
     刘伯承将军抬起头，
     看看地图点点头，
     一道命令传下头，
     队伍一齐扭回头，
     干部前面领着头，
     战士谁也不愿在后头。
     打了不够十几个钟头，
     捉住刘广信这个旅长头。
     咱们一中队顶在正前头，
     活捉三五五团的团长头。
     从后面送饭来了个伙夫头，
     担着饭桶跟敌人碰了头。
     他丢下饭桶就把炸弹投，
     敌人军官还不如作饭头，
     爬到地下就忙磕头，
     害怕杀了他的头。
     打完这一仗队伍就转头，
     一下就插到敌人心里头。
     邵耳砦敌人旅长头，
     正在布置队伍守前头，
     谁知道八路军打到他的眼前头，
     二中队主力攻东头，
     三中队主力配合攻西头，
     一共就有六七个火箭头，
     各种炮火都出风头，
     打得敌人不能抬头。
     二、三中队的英雄冲破鹿砦攻过外壕头，
     上梯子纷纷冲到村里头，
     大米运了五个钟头，
     都运到咱们的锅里头。
     大炮拉了整五门，
     都拉到咱们队伍里头。
     四川马大洋马足足拉了三百多头，
     鞍缰俱全还带皮笼头，
     军官们昏了头，
     太太们骑高头，
     小少爷还在他娘怀里咬奶头，
     一个个送到俘虏收容所里头。
     韩村歼灭战捉住伺冠三这个土匪头，
     上官村歼灭战捕住两个旅长头，
     这都是四个旅的敌人头，
     光剩下两个空拳头，
     这两仗打得国民大会也越开越没有劲头，
     进攻平汉线的敌人缩回头，
     鄄城、郓城群众又抬起头，
     胜利消息传后头，
     人人高兴点点头。
     蒋介石、
     你扭回头，
     看看你的背后头，
     全国人民要抬头，
     都是你的死对头，
     告诉你这个顽固头，
     要是坚持独裁卖国内战不回头，
     小心你那根臭骨头，
     小心你那根臭骨头！
