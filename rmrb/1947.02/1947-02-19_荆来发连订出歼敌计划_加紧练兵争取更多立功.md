[Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 17th] Jing Laifa, a special-class hero of the Liberation Detachment, known for his courage and wisdom in killing the enemy, has now formulated a plan for the entire company to annihilate the enemy and achieve meritorious service this year: (1) Maintain the glorious title of special-class hero and create more heroes. Annihilate one company and two platoons of the enemy throughout the year, and seize the enemy's new weapons to arm ourselves. Continuously study and summarize tactical experience to reduce casualties. (2) Strengthen political education to ensure constant high morale for combat. (3) Train one sharpshooter like Zhang Jizhi in each rifle squad (Zhang is the squad leader of the seventh squad of the company; in the Battle of Tiantai Temple, he killed twelve enemies with fourteen shots). Train one special-class shooter for each machine gun to ensure one enemy is hit with every five bullets. Train one artilleryman for each small cannon to ensure one hit with every two shots. And ensure that they all cherish weapons and save ammunition. (4) Seize the gaps in combat to conduct training. Master the four major skills, ensuring that each person can throw grenades an average of 35 meters. (5) Earnestly achieve unity between officers and soldiers, and unity between the army and the people. (6) Be neither arrogant nor conceited, learn from good companies, and resolutely carry out orders and instructions. (7) Abide by battlefield discipline, policies on prisoners of war, and mass discipline. (8) Universally organize and strengthen combat mutual aid groups, and learn from Jiao Wubao. (9) Strengthen administrative work, implement systems, abide by policies, regularly improve living conditions, and avoid corruption and degeneration.
