Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 19th: The Yan'an Liberation Daily yesterday published an editorial entitled "The Four Families Are the Crisis," attacking Chiang Kai-shek's remarks on economic emergency measures, pointing out that the root of the economic panic in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today lies in the US imperialist aggression against China and the rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen four families.

The editorial stated: "As is well known, if today there were no massive influx of American goods into the Chinese market (with imports exceeding exports by over one trillion yuan last year), no large amounts of American capital (four billion US dollars in loans, Lend-Lease materials, and surplus materials, as well as investments by companies like Chennault's and over a hundred other American companies in China) controlling the Chiang Kai-shek government and China's finance, industry, and commerce, if there were no humiliating treaties like the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, and if the United States did not support the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group so much militarily and politically, maintaining dictatorship and conducting large-scale civil war; tell me, how would China's industry and commerce be so unlucky? How would China's finances and currency become so corrupt? And where would a panic like the one today erupt from? Furthermore, if China did not have the traitorous, autocratic, corrupt rule of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen four families, if they did not use their unlimited political power to manipulate monopolies, 'speculate and take risks,' 'evade taxes and smuggle,' 'seize by trickery and plunder' (Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day speech this year), if they were not wholeheartedly selling out the country and recklessly engaging in civil war with the support of US imperialism; then China's peaceful life would have been established long ago, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference would have been implemented long ago, and democratic financial and economic policies would have been implemented long ago. How could China have an economic crisis of this nature like today?"

The newspaper refuted Chiang Kai-shek's fallacy about the root of the economic crisis, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek says the root of the economic crisis is 'because of the destruction caused by eight years of 'Japanese寇侵略',' is this credible? The military and civilians in the liberated areas fought bitterly behind enemy lines for eight years, and the damage they suffered from the Japanese寇 exceeded that of the Kuomintang areas many times over, but the liberated areas only see people living and working in peace and contentment, and no economic crisis. Chiang Kai-shek also says this is because the Communist Party is 'doing everything possible to destroy the economy,' is this credible? Even taking a step back and following Chiang Kai-shek's reasoning, then in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas that have not been 'destroyed by the Communist Party,' especially the southwestern provinces, the economy should be very stable. However, why are so many factories and shops closing down there, and why is the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth so terrible? Why is the economy so stable in the liberated areas under the leadership of the Communist Party, which 'makes it its business to destroy the economy,' and why is there no sign of a crisis?"

The editorial listed irrefutable facts, making a clear contrast between the social economy of the liberated areas and the Kuomintang areas: "The area of the Chinese liberated areas is larger than five Frances, and the population exceeds that of the United States, but the entire liberated area has no beggars, no unemployment, no bandits, and no financial or economic crisis. Prices here are stable, and people of all classes are moving towards a life of abundance." On the other hand, the latter's economic system already had deep and serious crises. Not to mention the distant past, in the past five months alone, according to extremely incomplete statistics: 27,000 factories and stores have closed down in 20 cities including Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, and prices have risen more than 10,000 times compared to before the War of Resistance; not to mention the bankruptcy of the countryside. At the same time, the Chiang government's finances are even more riddled with holes and have reached the end of the road.

The editorial pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek's "ingenious plan" to "rescue" the current economic crisis: First, he "'especially hopes that all friendly countries will recognize the measures to restore economic stability (?)' and 'regenerate themselves by their own efforts (?)' ... and give them sympathy and understanding." That is to say, the United States must allocate the 500 million yuan loan as soon as possible. Second, he vehemently scolded the Chinese Communist Party, aiming to mobilize his domestic and foreign reactionary forces to continue fighting, attempting to use civil war to maintain his dictatorial autocracy. As for the actual measures to "rescue" the crisis, in addition to repeating the old tune of "curbing speculation," strengthening controls, swallowing up China's industry and commerce, and better sheltering the four families, there are also: (1) All construction, except for military expenses which are the most "necessary," will be stopped; (2) Compatriots in the Chiang-controlled areas must tighten their belts even more to "support" the reactionary rule of the four families; (3) Although prices are rising and the burden is increasing, the wages of workers and staff must be actually reduced, and it is absolutely not allowed to go on strike or strike to improve treatment, and violators will be "severely punished." Therefore, the actual result of this method is like adding fuel to the fire, making wealth even more concentrated in the hands of the four families, the masses of the people even poorer, and a new crisis is bound to be even more serious.

The newspaper quoted Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointing out that the so-called "state" of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen four families is a "feudal fascist dictatorship of big landlords, big bankers, and big comprador classes," and the ideology they practice is "feudal, comprador, and fascist," and today, standing behind them and supporting them is US imperialism. Therefore, it is only natural that US imperialism "cares" about the economic crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas today, and that Marshall has declared that he will continue to assist Chiang Kai-shek, etc. However, even the Republican New York Herald Tribune says that this kind of assistance from US imperialism can only "prolong the pain," and "American money - even American money plus military supplies, cannot keep this government (referring to the Chiang government) in power forever."

The editorial concluded: "The rule of the Chiang Kai-shek-led four families is the greatest shame and disaster for the Chinese people, and it can only bring slavery, crisis, and death to all the Chinese people. The experience of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for the past twenty years and the experience of the people in the liberated areas for the past nine years have best proved a truth: if China is to be spared from famine, panic, and decline, there must be no imperialist aggression, no rule of the four families, and the Political Consultative Conference line must be implemented to establish a truly democratic coalition government."

### 四大家族就是危机  蒋介石发表经济紧急措施谰言  解放日报撰社论予以猛烈抨击

　　四大家族就是危机
    蒋介石发表经济紧急措施谰言
    解放日报撰社论予以猛烈抨击
    【新华社延安十九日电】延安解放日报昨日发表题为“四大家族就是危机”的社论，抨击蒋介石关于经济紧急措施的谈话，指出：今天在国民党统治区的经济恐慌的根源，就在于美国帝国主义对华的侵略，就在于蒋宋孔陈四大家族的统治。
    社论称：“如所周知，如果今天没有大量美货泛滥中国市场（去年入超达一万亿余元），没有大量美国资本（四十亿美元借款、租借物资和剩余物资，以及如陈纳德公司及百多家美国在华公司的投资）控制蒋介石政府和中国的金融工商业，如果没有像蒋美商约之类的卖身契，乃至如果美国不从军事和政治上如此支持蒋介石反动集团，维持独裁，进行大规模内战；试问中国的工商业那里会如此倒霉？中国的财政通货那里会取得如此糜烂？而像今天这样的恐慌又从那里来爆发？再则，如果中国没有蒋宋孔陈四大家族的卖国专制腐败统治，没有他们利用其无限的政治权力操纵垄断，“投机冒险”，“偷税走私”，“巧取豪夺”，（蒋介石今年元旦演说），没有他们一心一意卖国，在美国帝国主义支持下放肆进行内战；那末，中国的和平生活早已确立，政治协商会议的各项决议早在实施，民主的财政经济政策早在实行，中国还那里会有像今天这样性质的经济危机？”
    该报驳斥蒋介石关于经济危机根源的谬论称：蒋介石说经济危机的根源是“因为八年‘日寇侵略之破坏’，这话可信么？解放区军民在敌后苦战八年之久，其受日寇的破坏不知超过国民党区多少倍，但解放区却只见人民安居乐业，不见经济危机。蒋介石又说这是因为共产党‘尽其破坏经济之能事’，这话可信么？即便退一万步讲，照蒋介石所说的推论，那么在没有受到‘共党破坏’的蒋介石统治地区，尤其西南各省，应当是经济十分稳定的了。但是，为什么在那里工商业还是大批倒闭，民穷财尽到那般可怕的地步？为什么在以‘破坏经济’为‘能事’的共产党领导下的解放区，经济倒反十分稳定，见不到危机的踪影？”
    社论并列举无可置辩的事实，将解放区与国民党区的社会经济作了一个鲜明的对照：“中国解放区的面积大过五个法国，人口超过美国，但是整个解放区却没有乞丐，没有失业，没有盗匪，也没有什么财政危机和经济危机。这里的物价稳定，各阶层人民正走向丰衣足食。”而后者的经济体系则早已存在了深刻严重的危机。远的不说，最近五个月来，据极不完全的统计：上海、武汉、广州等二十个城市，工厂商店倒闭二万七千家，物价上涨较抗战前达万倍以上；农村的破产更不待言。照此同时，蒋政府的财政更加百孔千疮，山穷水尽。
    社论指出：蒋介石“解救”目前经济危机的妙计：首先，他“‘尤望各友邦认识恢复经济安定（？）’，‘自力更生’（？）之措施，……予以同情及谅解”。就是说，美国须从早拨付五亿元贷款。其次，就大骂一通中国共产党，目的在动员其国内外反动势力继续大打，企图用内战维持其独裁专制。至于实际“解救”危机的措施，除了重弹“遏止投机”的老调，加强管制，吞灭中国的工商业，更好地庇护四大家族之外，还有：（一）除军事费用最为“必要”外，其他建设一律停止；（二）蒋管区同胞必须更加勒紧肚带来“拥护”四大家族的反动统治；（三）物价尽管上涨，负担尽管增加，但职工工资必须实际减低，而且决不许可怠工罢工争取改善待遇，违者“从严处罚”。因此，这一办法实际的结果，正如火上加油，使财富更加集中到四大家族手里，人民大众更加贫苦，新的危机必然更加严重。
    该报引用中共中央毛泽东主席的话，指出蒋宋孔陈四大家族的所谓“国家”，就是“大地主、大银行家、大买办阶层的封建法西斯独裁国家”，他们所实行的主义，就是“封建的买办的法西斯主义”，而今天站在他们背后并为之撑腰的，则是美国帝国主义。因此，美国帝国主义的“关切”今天国民党区的经济危机，和马歇尔声明将继续援助蒋介石等等，这是很自然的。但是，美国帝国主义的这种援助，甚至共和党的纽约先驱论坛报也说，只能“延长痛苦”，而且“美国的金元——甚至美国金元再加上军需供应，都不能使此项政府（指蒋政府）永远维持政权”。
    社论结论：“蒋介石所领导的四大家族的统治，乃是中国人民的最大耻辱与灾难，它带给全中国人民的只能是奴役、危机和死亡。二十年来，国民党统治区人民的经验，和九年来解放区人民的经验，都最好不过地证明了一条真理：如若要中国免于饥馑、恐慌与衰亡，就决不能有帝国主义的侵略，决不能有四大家族的统治，而必须实行政协路线，建立一个真正民主的联合政府。”
