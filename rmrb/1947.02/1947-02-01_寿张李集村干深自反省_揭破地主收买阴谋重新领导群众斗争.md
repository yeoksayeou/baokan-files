(This report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, dated the 29th) Shouzhang Sixth District, Liji Village, exposed a landlord conspiracy and launched a struggle. After the rent and interest reduction struggle in 1942, the feudal landlords Li Mingde and Li Mengkun gave money to the peasant association cadres to open small shops, and used 7 shi of soybeans to bribe the village cadre Li, who then stopped leading the struggle. After that, the masses in the peasant association did not dare to speak up when something happened. In this land reform, several landlord families were not struggled against, but several feudal rich peasant families were. Li Mingde even gained the reputation of being a "good landlord." The masses did not get anything and complained a lot, with some saying, "Relying on the peasant association is useless; it's better to make a small business to make a living." After Yuncheng was occupied by Chiang's army, which was still 60 miles away from Liji, the landlord organized a puppet regime, appointed Li Zhaorui, who had been a puppet village chief, as the district chief, and incited the self-defense captain Li Zhaofeng and the sub-district committee member Li Jing three to oppose the current village chief, saying that the village chief Li Mingsan was corrupt. The peasant association cadres were fooled and started blaming each other. Later, after the leadership discovered this problem, they asked the village cadres to reflect on themselves, pointed out the masses' opinions about them, and pointed out the landlord's conspiracy. At that time, sub-district committee member Li Mingcun was the first to realize what was happening, and the other village cadres also came to their senses. At a mass meeting, Li Mingcun said: "Folks, I'm so sorry for you all. I was fooled by the landlords. Several of us secretly used the grain, which Li Mingde told me to do. Only now do I understand that they welcome the Central Army to take our heads." After the village cadres reflected on their actions, they immediately pulled the landlord Li Mingde to the front, and everyone got angry: "Li Mingde, you are a bad egg! Why did you sabotage the peasant association?"... Li Mingde, Li Mengkun, and Li Zhaorui finally bowed their heads in front of the masses. The three bad eggs were all escorted to the village office. The village cadres returned to the masses, and the masses were as happy as flowers blooming, with smiles on their faces. Now, under the leadership of the village cadres, the masses of the whole village have once again launched a thorough reckoning with the despotic landlords.

　　寿张李集村干深自反省
    揭破地主收买阴谋重新领导群众斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】寿张六区李集，揭破地主阴谋，掀起斗争。该村在一九四二年经过减租减息斗争后，封建地主李明德、李梦坤便给农会干部拿钱开小铺，又用七石豆子收买村干李某，干部不领导斗争了，从此农会有了事群众不敢说话。这次土地改革，几家地主没有斗，斗了几家封建富农，李明德还落了个“好地主”，群众没得到东西，怨言很多，有的说：“指望着农会不行，还是做个小买卖能糊口”。郓城被蒋军侵占后，离李集还有六十多里地，地主就组织了伪政权，叫曾当过伪村长的李兆瑞当区长，并鼓动着自卫队长李兆风及小区委员李景三反对现任村长，说村长李明三贪污，农会干部上了当，互相找错。后来领导上发现这一问题后，让村干反省，指明群众对他们的意见，并指出地主的阴谋。当时小区委员李明存首先觉悟了，其余的几个村干也想开了，在群众大会上，李明存说：“老少爷们，我太对不起你们了，我上了地主的当，我们几个人偷着使了粮食，那是地主李明德叫我做的，现在才明白他们欢迎中央军来要咱的头。”村干部反省后，当场把地主李明德拉到前面，大家的气起来了：“李明德，你是个坏蛋，你为啥破坏农会？”……李明德、李梦坤及李兆瑞，在大众面前终于低了头，三个坏蛋一齐被押到村公所。村干又回到群众中了，群众欢喜的心像花开了一样，脸上都有了笑色。现全村群众在村干领导下重新展开了对恶霸地主的彻底清算。
