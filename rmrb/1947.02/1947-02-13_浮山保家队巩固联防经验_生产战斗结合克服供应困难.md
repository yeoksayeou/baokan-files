Fushan Home Guard Team Consolidates Joint Defense Experience
Production and Combat Combined to Overcome Supply Difficulties
Mutual Learning and Assistance to Improve Skills

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th dispatch] Since the launch of the Fushan village Home Guard's spider web joint defense, it has yielded great results. The experiences are summarized as follows: 1. Engaging in both combat and production to overcome difficulties in food and ammunition. When the Home Guard teams in each village first started their activities, they ate food supplied uniformly by the village, which became a burden on the masses over time. However, going home to eat individually would hinder collective action. After discussion, it was decided to pool shares and engage in production, combining combat and production, and earning dividends to solve the food problem. Secondly, during combat, when ammunition was insufficient, some team members voluntarily contributed money to buy it, and the masses in various villages also voluntarily offered small amounts of ammunition, which solved part of the ammunition problem. 2. Improving skills. When the Home Guard teams first engaged in combat, their skills were poor, they consumed a lot of ammunition, and achieved little. After review, the slogan "Three Don'ts" was put forward to save ammunition and kill more enemies: (1) Don't shoot without approaching the enemy. (2) Don't shoot without aiming accurately. (3) Don't shoot if you can't kill. New members intensify their training in aiming every morning and evening. Chen Honghe from Mijia Yuan joined not long ago and killed an enemy with one shot in Xiaoguo Village. 3. Organizing mutual assistance between the brave and the timid. Some militiamen were nervous when they first fought, and lost their composure at the sight of the enemy. Brave people only cared about rushing forward, creating a disconnect between the vanguards and those lagging behind. Therefore, mutual assistance groups were proposed. Each brave person led two or three timid people. During combat, the brave fought in the front, and the timid followed closely behind, gradually building up their courage. Wang Cunli and others, who were timid in Guojiazhuang, Fourth District, participated in several battles under the leadership of Cui Jinrong and became bolder. He said that it was scary to listen to the fighting, but when actually approaching the enemy, he was not afraid of anything.

Distribute Spoils According to Need

4. Distribute spoils according to need to consolidate village and joint defense. Initially, the spoils of war were handled by a few cadres, and the distribution was not fair and reasonable, causing dissatisfaction among the Home Guard members and loosening the joint defense operations. Zhuge and Nanwang were originally very flexible in their contact, but due to improper distribution of spoils, the two villages once had disagreements. Later, it was changed to democratic decision-making, distributing spoils according to need, returning ox carts and some vegetables to the masses, giving more ammunition to the Home Guard teams closer to the enemy, and giving more other items to those farther away. Everyone was very satisfied with this distribution method, and the joint defense between the villages became more consolidated.

    浮山保家队巩固联防经验
    生产战斗结合克服供应困难
    互学互助  提高技术
    【本报太岳十日电】浮山各村保家队蛛网联防展开以来，收获很大。总结经验如下：一、一面打仗，一面生产，克服了食粮和子弹的困难。各村保家队开始活动是在村里统一派饭吃，长久了就成为群众的负担，可是各自回家吃又要防碍集体行动。后经大家讨论，决定集股搞生产，一面打仗，一面生产，赚下红利，解决了粮食问题。其次在战斗中子弹不够，有些队员自动拿钱去买，各村群众也多自动献出零星子弹，也就解决了部分子弹问题，二、提高技术。保家队开始作战时，技术差些，消耗子弹多，收获小。经检讨后提出“三不打”的口号，以节省子弹，多杀敌人。（１）不接近敌不打。（２）瞄不准不打。（３）打不死的不打。新队员每天早晚加紧学习瞄准。米家垣的陈红合参加不久，即在小郭村一枪打死一个敌人。三、胆大的与胆小的组织互助。有些民兵初次打仗，一见敌人就沉不住气，胆大的人只顾向前冲，形成了先锋和落后者的脱节。大家又提出组互织助组。每个胆大的带领两三个胆小的。战斗时胆大的在前面打，胆小的紧跟在后面，慢慢地胆就壮了。四区郭家庄胆怯的王存礼等在崔金荣的带领下，参加过数次战斗，就胆大了。他说打仗是听着怕，真正接近敌人就什么也不怕了。
    胜利品按需分配
    四、按需分配战果，巩固联村联防。起初战利品由少数干部处理，分配不尽公平合理，引起保家队员不满，松散了联防作战。诸葛、南王原来联系非常机动，后因分配胜利品不恰当，两村曾一度发生意见。后改为民主决定，按需分配胜利品，将牛车和一部蔬菜归还群众，距敌近的保家队多分枪弹，距敌较远的多得其他东西。这样分法大家都很满意，以后各村联防更加巩固。
