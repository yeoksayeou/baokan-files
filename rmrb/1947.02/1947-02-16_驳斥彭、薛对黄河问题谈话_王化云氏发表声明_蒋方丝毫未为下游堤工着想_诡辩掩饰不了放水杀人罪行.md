(This Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, February 15th) Wang Huayun, Director of the Jilu豫 Yellow River Commission, issued a statement refuting Peng Xuepei's statement on the Yellow River issue on January 14th and Xue Dubi's on January 26th. The full text is as follows:

Peng Xuepei's statement on January 16th and Xue Dubi's on January 24th regarding the Yellow River issue aim to cover up the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracy to inundate over ten million people along the Yellow River in Jilu豫, and to further completely accomplish this poisonous scheme. Looking back over the past year, regarding the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, we have consistently advocated rescuing the compatriots in the Yellow River flooded area, but also preventing the people of Jilu豫 from suffering the disaster of the flooded area again. This fair proposition, with the support of national public opinion, led to the signing of the Heze and Nanjing agreements with the Chiang side. The agreements clearly stipulate: "For urgent downstream projects, including the dangerous sections of the dike to be rebuilt, and local dredging of the river channel, straightening of bends, and shortening of the course, the required funds shall be fully provided by the Water Conservancy Commission, and the required materials shall be given priority and expedited supply by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration." However, the Jilu豫 Liberated Area accounts for two-thirds of the entire river dike, and of the 66 billion yuan allocated for dike reconstruction, only 6 billion yuan has been allocated to date, less than one-tenth of the total amount. Moreover, since March of last year, the Chiang side has continuously arrested our dike repair workers. Sun Youyuan, a member of our Qihe dike repair committee, and Cao Linyuan, a section chief, are still being detained by the Chiang side; Zhang Yanchang, the chief of the Ningji dike defense section, and 24 others were brutally murdered. In August, the Chiang army launched a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Area, looting all the engineering materials and equipment we had stored along the river, causing us a loss of 3 billion yuan. Chiang planes even bombed and strafed dike repair workers and water management agencies, resulting in over sixty casualties in Linpu alone. Therefore, we were forced to suspend all work, with only half of the dike construction completed, and no work done on dangerous sections or river channel dredging. Now, six months later, when it is freezing cold, the Chiang army is attacking, and Chiang planes are bombing, making it impossible for us to start work, Peng and Xue actually claim that mid-October to the end of January is the most suitable season for construction, "beneficial to dike construction" and "harmless to the downstream." In fact, the so-called most suitable season is simply the season when the poisonous scheme to inundate the Liberated Area is easiest to carry out, and the people in the Liberated Area are least able to escape and save themselves. The so-called "beneficial" and "harmless" only apply to those who are blocking the river and releasing water. How have they ever considered the downstream dike construction at all! Because our dike construction is not completed, the dangerous sections have not been repaired, and the riverbed silt has not been dredged, a sudden flood will inevitably cause flooding. Facts have proven that the water diverted from the Yin River into the old course, which is less than one-twentieth of the total river water, has already caused a major disaster. To date, more than sixty villages and over four hundred hectares of farmland have been flooded, and 90 percent of the farmland has already been sown with wheat. 300,000 riverbed residents have been displaced. More than forty people along the river have drowned while trying to cross the river on ice because there are no ferries. This is just a scattered and incomplete report. As for the houses, trees, reeds, etc., that have been flooded, it is impossible to count. If the river is blocked more in a short period of time, causing the water to rise sharply, the downstream disaster will be even greater, and the lives and property of millions of river residents will not be guaranteed. Before this unprecedented catastrophe, when millions of river residents are suffering from hunger and cold, they actually say it is harmless to the downstream. Their sinister intentions are extremely obvious.

Peng and Xue also claimed: "The unfinished dike construction can be rushed." However, recently, when we tried to rush to repair the eroded dike, we were repeatedly strafed by Chiang planes and sabotaged by Chiang agents. On the 11th of last month, Chiang agents cut seventeen sections of the Zhang Yangji dangerous section in Shou Zhang, and on the 13th, seven sections of the Sunkou dangerous section were cut again. On the same day, Nanhua dike repair workers were strafed by the Chiang army in Dongming, killing and wounding ten people and robbing over 300 kilograms of hemp rope. On the 31st, dike workers at the Chuwo dam in Xiu County were strafed by Chiang planes, killing thirteen workers including Li Ziyi. On February 1st, Chiang planes strafed Sunkou in Shou Zhang again, killing and wounding twenty-three workers. In recent days, the total number of workers killed and wounded has reached more than ninety. Under these circumstances of Chiang army and Chiang agent sabotage and Yellow River flooding, how can two thousand miles of long dike and hundreds of dangerous dike sections be "rushed"?

Peng and Xue also said: "The shacks built in the riverbed are all easy to move." In the eyes of the officials and lords who live in Western-style houses and eat big dishes, these houses are of course nothing; however, this is all the property that the river residents have earned from half a lifetime of hard work, and it is their lifeline! When the Yellow River flowed, they wandered for many years; after the Yellow River changed its course, they endured hunger and suffering for eight or nine years, reclaimed some sandy land, built some earthen houses, and planted some trees, so that their wives and children could barely make a living. Now everything is gone, what can they rely on to live? Peng and Xue said: "They can each get 100,000 in relief funds." However, since the agreement on river residents' relocation fees was signed on July 8th of last year, stipulating that 1 billion legal tender would be paid every month in August, September, and October, and that it would be paid in full in November, the Chiang side has failed to comply with the agreement and has been in arrears to this day. How could even a penny reach the people in the Liberated Area?! Moreover, the selection of a suitable time to migrate to Anqing is a pursuit of truth. In December, the Chiang side secretly released water from the Yin River into the old course, causing such a great disaster. The bloody facts are before our eyes. Today, no matter how cleverly Peng and Xue quibble, they cannot cover up the bloody smell of their crime of releasing water and killing people!

　　驳斥彭、薛对黄河问题谈话
    王化云氏发表声明
    蒋方丝毫未为下游堤工着想
    诡辩掩饰不了放水杀人罪行
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】冀鲁豫黄委会主任王化云氏发表声明，驳斥一月十四日彭学沛和一月二十六日薛笃弼对黄河问题的谈话，全文如下：
    一月十六日彭学沛与二十四日薛笃弼对黄河问题的谈话，其目的在于掩饰国民党当局淹没冀鲁沿河千余万人民的阴谋，并进一步彻底完成这一毒计。回溯一年来，关于黄河归故问题，我们一贯主张挽救黄泛区同胞，但也不使冀鲁人民重遭泛区的灾害。这一公允主张，在全国舆论支持下，曾与蒋方签订荷泽、南京两协议。协议中明文规定：“下游急要工程，包括复堤之险工，及局部整理河漕裁弯取直，所需工款由水利委员会充分筹支，所需器材由行总联总优先尽速供给。”但冀鲁解放区占全河堤的三分之二，而六百六十亿复堤工款，截止现在，仅拨给六十亿，尚不及全数十分之一。且自去年三月，蒋方即不断逮捕我修堤员工，我方齐河修堤委员孙右垣、科长曹林园，至今还被蒋方扣押；宁济修防段长张彦昌等二十四人则惨遭杀害。八月份蒋军大举进攻解放区，把我方沿河储备之工料器材抢劫一空，我方损失达三十亿元之巨。蒋机更轰炸扫射修堤员工及治河机关，仅临濮一地，就死伤六十余人。因此，我方被迫全部停工，堤工仅完成二分之一，险工及整理河漕均未进行。到今日，时隔六月之久，在天寒地冻、蒋军进攻、蒋机轰炸，我方无法动工之际，彭薛竟借口说十月中旬到正月底为施工最适宜之季节，“于堤工有益”，“于下游无害”。其实所谓最适宜的季节，只是淹没解放区的毒计最容易进行，而解放区人民最无法逃避与自救的季节。所谓“有益”“无害”，也只是对他们堵口放水者而言，何尝丝毫为下游堤工着想！因为我方堤工未完，险工未整，河床淤沙未疏浚，洪水突来，焉能不泛？事实证明，这次由引河流入故道之水，不及全部河水廿分之一，即已造成巨灾。截止目前为止，已淹没六十余村庄，四百多顷田地，而田地中百分之九十已播有麦种；河床居民已有三十万无家可归。沿河居民因无渡船，缘冰涉水而淹死的已有四十多人。这还仅是零星的不完全报告，至于房屋、树木、芦苇等被淹没的，更无法统计。如在短期间更加的堵口，使水势暴涨，下游灾害将益更扩大，千万河民的生命财产将不可保。在此空前浩劫之前，在千万河民啼饥号寒之际，竟言对下游无害，其包藏祸心，实极为明显。
    彭薛并声称：“未完成之堤工可以赶办”，但最近我方抢修被冲刷的堤工时，竟屡遭蒋机扫射蒋特破坏。上月十一日，蒋特在寿张张杨集险工割断一十七条，十三日孙口险工又被割断七条。同日，南华抢修河堤员工，被东明蒋军用机枪扫射，死伤十人，抢去麻绳六百余斤。三十一日修县储窝堤坝员工被蒋机扫射，死工人李子义等十三人。二月一日蒋机又扫射寿张孙口，员工死伤二十三人。日来员工死伤总计已达九十余人。试问在此蒋军蒋特破坏黄水泛滥的情况下，两千里的长堤，数百处堤坝险工，如何能够“赶办”？
    彭薛又说：“河床中搭盖的都是易于迁移的棚户。”在住洋房吃大菜的达官老爷们眼里，这些房屋当然不算什么；可是，这就是河民们半生血汗所换来的全部财产，就是他们的命根了！黄河在时，他们长年流浪；黄河改道后，他们忍饥受苦八九年，开垦了一些沙地，盖了一些土房，栽种了一些树木，老婆孩子才能勉强糊口。而今一切都付东流，叫他们依靠什么活命？彭薛说：“他们每人可得十万救济费。”但自去年七月八日签订了河民迁移费的协定，规定八、九、十三个日每月付法币十亿元，十一月付清。而蒋方不遵协议，拖欠至今，那会一文钱到解放区人民手里？！而况迁移安庆选择适当时间求诉真理。十二月间蒋方偷放引河水归故，已造成这样大的灾害，血淋淋的事实摆在眼前，今天彭薛再巧言诡辩，也遮掩不住他们放水杀人的血腥气味！
