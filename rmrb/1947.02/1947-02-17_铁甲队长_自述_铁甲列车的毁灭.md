　　"Ironclad Captain" Narrates:
    The Destruction of the Armored Train
    ·Wang Ruo·
    Captain Cui Deshan, deputy company commander of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek army's Armored Corps, who had just laid down his arms at the front, was in the room where he was being entertained. After drinking two cups of warm tea, he recounted his capture in a torrent of words: "Yesterday (the 2nd) at 21:30, the battalion headquarters ordered my 'Armored Train No. 23' and 'Armored Car No. 24' to patrol Xiaoba, expecting a battle to occur on the way. But I thought the Eighth Route Army's few broken machine guns couldn't penetrate the armor. When we arrived at Xiaoba, before half of the train had entered the station, we came under fire. The fighting intensified for over forty minutes. When I saw that we were surrounded, I didn't even bother to call No. 24 car and ordered a quick return to Shangqiu. Entering the 375-kilometer section, the sound of the train changed. I telephoned the driver, warning: 'Be careful, the track ahead seems to be faulty.' When the train reached the bridgehead, with a 'boom,' one entire car plunged under the bridge. The sounds of gunfire and explosions were all around. What I feared the most happened. I decided to blow up that car and notified the driver to go full speed back to Xiaoba and join up with car No. 24, so we could support each other if anything happened. We didn't go far west when the water tank was damaged by an anti-tank rifle. I tried my best to calm myself. I made up my mind that there was one mountain gun, two howitzers, one grenade launcher, two heavy machine guns, two light machine guns, and more than twenty rifles on the train, with sufficient ammunition. Moreover, the car had one or two layers of three-@ thick steel armor, with a ten-odd-centimeter-thick concrete wall in the middle. No matter what, we could hold out until dawn, then there would be a solution, so I ordered the men to resolutely defend to the death.” Cui Deshan lit a cigarette and continued, "Your artillery is truly formidable. I was there, and that one shot hit my command car." In the flickering lamplight, his face was very pale and unsightly. I don’t know if it was because he felt cold or because he was a little bewildered by the thought of last night's experience. "The car body was turned upside down by the shelling, and the steel armor of the car wall was broken. If another shot came, I believe the shell would explode in the car. At this time, I could only close my eyes and resign myself to fate. Fortunately, there were no more shells. Then the explosives went off. Division Commander He's car was almost completely stunned, and two brothers were killed on the spot. I saw that it was already dawn, and I estimated that reinforcements could arrive after dawn, so I ordered to continue to resist and wait for reinforcements. At ten o'clock, the reinforcements still did not come. I secretly opened the firing hole and looked out, seeing that all around were the Eighth Route Army, constantly approaching the armored train. Many people drilled into a neighboring car. I understood why the reinforcements didn't come; we had encountered such a tough Eighth Route Army. It was impossible to break through. Was I really going to die? What about my mother, wife, and children? I simply didn't dare to think about it. At noon, the plane came, although there was only one, I finally felt hopeful. But it was really annoying, it circled a few times and flew away. The morning passed, and the plane didn't come again. Your soldiers stuffed dry grass under the car one by one, climbed onto the roof of the car, and shouted: 'Quickly surrender, surrender and you won't be killed, if you don't surrender we will burn the car'. Who wants to be burned alive? Everyone was anxious. Since things had come to this, I said: 'Forget it, let's surrender...'." Cui Lieutenant stopped here, thought for a while, and then looked up and added, "With your kind of fighting, no one can survive." He threw the half-smoked cigarette butt far away, clasped his hands together, and let out a slight bitter laugh.

　　“铁甲队长”自述
    铁甲列车的毁灭
    ·王若·
    刚从前线放下武器的蒋军铁甲总队一大队二中队副中队长崔德山上尉，在招待他的屋子里，喝过两杯暖茶，滔滔不绝的叙述他被俘的经过：“昨日（二日）二十一时半，大队部命令我‘第廿三号铁甲列车’和‘第二十四号铁甲车’往小坝巡逻，预计在路上会有战争发生，可是我想八路军的几架破机枪是打不破装甲的。到了小坝，半截车尚未进入站口，就接上了火，打了四十多分钟，越打越紧，当我看到四面受敌时，也没顾上照呼二十四号车，就叫赶快开回商邱去。进入三七五公里地段，车声变了模样，我打电话警告司机：‘小心些，前边路轨好像出了毛病’。等火车到桥根，‘轰隆’一声，一辆车箱整个儿栽到桥下去了。车外枪声炸弹响成一片，怕的是这，恰偏偏遇上了。我决心把那辆车箱炸了，通知司机，开足马力回小坝，和二十四号车靠拢，有啥事可以互相援助。往西走了不多远，水箱被战防枪打坏了，我尽力镇静着自己。拿定主意，车上有一门山炮，两门曲射炮，一个掷弹筒，两挺重机枪，两挺轻机枪，廿多支步枪，子弹充足，何况车箱有一两层三＠厚的钢甲，中间还有十来生的厚的水泥墙，无论如何坚持到天明就有办法，所以就命令弟兄们坚决死守。崔德山燃着一枝烟继续说道：“你们的炮真是厉害啊，我是亲临其境的，那一炮就打中了我的指挥车”。在摇曳的灯光下，他的脸色很是苍白难看，不知是嫌冷呢，还是因为想起昨晚的遭遇而有些惶惑。“车身被打的左右颠倒，车墙的铁甲被打破了，要是再来一炮，我相信炮弹就会在车箱里爆炸的。我在这时候，只有闭上眼睛听天由命，幸亏炮再没有打。接着炸药响了，何分队长那个车里几乎全被震晕了，有两名弟兄当时被震死了。我看到天已经发亮，估计天亮以后，援兵就可以到，于是仍旧命令继续抵抗，等待援兵。十点钟了，援兵仍不来，我偷偷的拉开射击孔，向外了望，看见四周尽是八路军，一直向铁甲列车逼近，许多人一下钻进了邻近的一间车箱。我明白了援兵为什么不来，原来碰上了这样硬的八路。突围是不可能的。难道我真该死吗？母亲老婆孩子怎么办呢？简直不敢想下去。正午飞机来了，虽然只有一架，我终觉得有希望。但是真气人，打了几个转，就飞走了。上午过了，飞机不再来。你们的战士们一个个背着干草往车下塞，爬上车顶喊着：‘赶快缴枪，缴枪不杀，再不缴枪就要烧车了’。谁愿被活活的烧死呢？大家都着了急，事已至此，我就说：‘算了，缴枪就缴吧………’。崔上尉说到这儿，低头想了一回，又抬起头来补充了一句：“你们这种打法，无论是谁都是活不了的”。他把半截烟屁股远远一掷，交握着双手，发出轻微的苦笑。
