　　Guarantee Completion of the Hundred-Day Textile Plan
    Pingshun Trains Grassroots Women Cadres at Key Points
    [Reported from Pingshun by this newspaper] Pingshun County has set a hundred-day textile plan. After careful calculation, the county has 21,908 women who spin, 80 spinning machines, 21,903 spinning wheels, 2,773 plain looms, and 500 shuttle looms. In 100 days, deducting 25 days for miscellaneous tasks, if each woman spins an average of three liang of yarn and weaves one jin of cloth per day, they can produce 307,000 jin of yarn and 270,000 jin of cloth. Regarding the problem of 350,000 jin of raw materials (cotton), 280,000 jin were prepared last winter, the county and district joint cooperatives bought back 40,000 jin, and the remaining 30,000 jin will be solved by the cooperatives without any problem. To ensure the realization of this plan, the county women's association has specially gathered more than 30 women cadres from key villages in each district for textile training, divided into five steps: cotton spinning, sizing yarn, warping, winding yarn, and weaving. After learning, they will go back to lead the primary spinning women in the whole county. In addition, county-level agencies have jointly organized inspection teams to go deep into districts and villages to solve raw material problems. To realize the hundred-day textile plan, the Liberated Area recently convened a meeting of women's associations, cooperative managers, and woodworking workers to discuss textile issues. It was decided to manufacture 300 "Yan'an-style" large-wheel spinning wheels, because the efficiency of this type of spinning wheel is ten to six compared to the local spinning wheels. Workers from the district joint cooperative woodworking factory have been dispatched to the countryside to manufacture them. More than ten villages in the whole district, such as Hanjia, Beishe, and Doukou, have begun the campaign, proposing the slogan "people, wheels, and machines are never idle."

    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to fulfill the Party Committee's call to weave 4.75 million jin of cloth within a hundred days, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee convened a joint conference of major economic and financial cadres from various counties on the 6th to conduct a detailed study on women's spinning. The key to carrying out the textile movement: First, extensively use the activists in the mass movement, open up ideas from the lives of the masses, and widely mobilize, and combine textile with mobilizing women. Second, after the new districts let go of mobilizing women, they must be organized in a timely manner, overcoming the organizational method of gradually expanding from small to large in the 1942 production and disaster relief, but should not create mandatory orders due to emphasizing organization. Third, strengthen the women's rescue and cooperative cadres, and improve the village cooperatives to regulate raw materials and promote finished products. Fourth, on the basis of universally starting native spinning wheels and native machines, improve technology and improve tools.

　　保证完成百日纺织计划
    平顺集训基点妇干
    【本报平顺讯】平顺全县已订出百日纺织计划。经精确计算，全县纺妇二万一千九百零八名，纺纱机八十辆，纺车二万一千九百零三辆；平机二千七百七十三架，拉梭机五百架。百天内除去二十五天干杂活，每天每个纺妇平均纺纱三两，织布一斤，即可得纱三十万零七千斤，并织成布二十七万斤。而三十五万斤原料（花）问题，去冬已准备下二十八万斤，县区联社又买回四万斤，其余三万斤由合作社解决不成问题。为确切实现这一计划，县妇会特调集各区基点村妇干三十多人进行纺织训练，分纺花、浆纱、经线、络纱、织布五个步骤，学会后回去分别领导全县初学纺妇。另外县级各机关共同组织检查团，深入区村解决原料，解放区为实现百日纺织计划，于日前召开妇会、合作社经理、木工工人讨论纺织问题。确定制造“延安式”大轮纺车三百辆；因该式纺车与土纺车其效率为十与六之比，区联社木工厂工人已分别下乡制造。全区韩家、北社、豆口等十余村已开始运动，提出“人、车、机三不闲”口号。

    【本报讯】太行五地委为完成区党委一百天内纺织四百七十五万斤布的号召，于六日召开各县主要干部财经联席会议，对妇纺作了详细研讨。开展纺织运动的关键：一、大量运用群运中的积极分子，从群众生活中打通思想，广泛动员，并把纺织和发动妇女结合起来。二、新区放手把妇女动员起来后，要及时加以组织，克服四二年生产救灾中由小到大的组织方式，但不能因强调组织起来产生强制命令作法。三、加强妇救与合作干部，健全村合作社，以调剂原料与推销成品。四、在普遍开动土纺车与士机基础上，提高技术改良工具。
