　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Order
    Revision of Land Requisition Draft
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, based on the experience of various regions in requisitioning landlords' land, has proven that the principle of purchase based on current cultivation hinders the landless or land-poor people, who constitute the majority of the population, from obtaining land. It has now issued a revised order to the draft of the Regulations on the Requisition of Landlords' Land, revising Article 11 on the principle of purchase in its entirety to: "The distribution of requisitioned land should be allocated to the landless or land-poor impoverished people according to population, so that the quantity and quality of land owned by each person reaches a general average." In addition, the amendment order also decided to cancel in full Article 3 of Article 2 and Article 25 of the original regulations. Note: Article 3 of Article 2 of the original requisition regulations stated: "Land cultivated by the landlord himself shall not be requisitioned." Article 25 stated: "Trees and vegetable gardens on the land that were planted by tenants belong to the tenants, those planted by landlords belong to the landlords, and forests that grow naturally on barren hills are handled along with the land."

　　陕甘宁边府命令
    修正土地征购草案
    【新华社延安十三日电】陕甘宁边区政府根据各地征购地主土地的经验，证明以现耕为基础之承购原则，妨碍占人口大多数之无地或少地人民得到土地，顷特发布征购地主土地条例草案之修正命令，对承购原则之第十一条全文修改为“征购土地之分配，应按人口分配给无地或少地之贫苦人民，使每人所有之土地数量与质量达到大体的平均”。又该修正命令中对原条例第二条第三款，与第二十五条亦决定全文取消。按：原征购条例第二条第三款为“地主自力耕种之土地不得征购”。第二十五条为“土地上之树木及菜园属于佃户栽种者归佃户，属于地主栽种者归地主，荒山自生之森林随地处理。
