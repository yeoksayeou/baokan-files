　　The Masses of Minquan and Shangqiu Assist Our Army in Destroying Roads
　　[Report from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, Fourteenth] From the 2nd to the 4th, when our army destroyed the railway between Liuhe Xiao＠ East and West, Minquan and Shangqiu on the Longhai Line, the local people rushed to help our army dismantle the rails and roadbeds, and said bitterly: "Chiang Kai-shek transports troops to fight a civil war, and we have suffered a lot from you (referring to the railway)." Many people have begun to move to the liberated areas. They firmly believe that only the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government can guarantee the safety of the people's lives and property, and enable them to enjoy a truly democratic and free life. The hatred of the people along the Longhai Line for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and his bloody rule can be seen from this. (Fang De)
　　[Report from the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, Fourteenth] The Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Department armored vehicle team annihilated by our army on the Longhai Line was established in April last year. The patrol line of the first battalion is the Longhai Xu (zhou) Kai (feng) section and the Jinpu Xu (zhou) Pu (kou) section. The battalion has three companies, each with two armored trains. Together with the two command armored trains directly under the battalion headquarters, there are a total of eight trains. The annihilated team was commanded by the deputy company commander of the second company. There are still five battalions on the Jiaoji Line in Shandong. This is the first time that the team has been annihilated by the people's army. The captured armored vehicle compartments and car walls are made of two layers of three-tenths of an inch thick steel plates, which are filled with cement, and general artillery fire cannot penetrate them. In Chiang's armored trains, there are only two such carriages in each train, and the rest are carriages painted with oil paint, disguised as transporting goods or conscripts, in order to strengthen the momentum.

　　民权商邱群众协助我军破路
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十四日电】二日至四日，我军摧毁陇海线民权、商邱间柳河小＠东西之铁路时，当地民众纷纷自动帮助我军拆除路轨与路基，恨恨地说：“蒋介石运兵打内战，咱可吃你（指铁路）的亏不少。”并有不少群众开始迁至解放区居住。他们深信唯有八路军和民主政府才能保证人民生命财产的安全，使他们享受真正民主自由的生活。陇海沿线民众对蒋介石打内战及他的血腥统治的愤恨由此可见。（方德）
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十四日电】在陇海线上被我歼灭之蒋记国防部装甲车队，系于去年四月间成立，第一大队巡逻线为陇海徐（州）开（封）段及津浦徐（州）浦（口）段。该大队下属三个中队，每中队有铁甲车两列。与直辖大队部之两列指挥铁甲车合计共为八列。被歼者系二中队副中队长所指挥者。山东胶济线上尚有五个大队。该队为人民军队歼灭尚属首次。缴获之铁甲车厢、车壁为三分厚的钢板两层装成，其中满填水泥，一般炮火无法打透。此类车厢在蒋记铁甲列车中每列仅两个，其余多为运货或运壮丁用的车厢涂上油漆所伪装者，借此以壮声势。
