    [Report from the Jilu Yu Front, February 8th] Before the liberation of Bo County, General Liu Bocheng's troops annihilated 3,000 men of the Kuomintang Army's 75th Division (1,500 killed and 1,500 captured), seized eight mountain guns, six anti-tank guns, three rocket launchers, over a thousand rifles, and fourteen vehicles. When General Liu Bocheng's troops counterattacked Bo County, Wang Jingjiu, commander of the 27th Army of the Nationalist Army stationed in Shangqiu, urgently selected over 3,000 elite soldiers from two regiments and one artillery battalion of the 75th Division's 16th Brigade stationed in Shangqiu, led by Chen Zhida, commander of the 16th Brigade, and rushed to Bo County by car in an attempt to reinforce and defend it. However, the Eighth Route Army had already liberated the city in a two-hour fierce battle on the evening of the 2nd. On the 3rd, when the Chiang army advanced to the Dingdazhuang area, about five li northwest of the city, they were surrounded by the ambushing Eighth Route Army and a part of them was annihilated that night. On the 4th, the Chiang army sent a large number of aircraft in an attempt to cover their breakout, but the Eighth Route Army held the enemy tightly and inflicted a heavy blow. Except for Chen Zhida, who fled with about 20 followers, the rest were all annihilated.

Over a hundred were killed, and 2,890 people, including Sun Jingxuan, the Chiang's Luyi County Magistrate, and security team leaders, were captured. Seized four heavy machine guns, thirty-six light machine guns, two thousand and ninety-two rifles, eight pistols, two grenade launchers, over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, over 300 bombs, six telephones, and over 20 war horses.
