　　【This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 17th】The Taihang Administrative Office convened a meeting of the heads of civil affairs sections of various special districts and municipalities on January 9th, with the participation of the heads of civil affairs sections of six counties: Shexian, Linxian, Licheng, Lucheng, Lincheng, and Changzhi. The focus of the meeting was to inspect and strengthen the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families and cadre work in various regions. The meeting lasted for 20 days. Based on survey materials from various regions, the meeting first affirmed that the Taihang region's work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment has been successful over the years. Rich experience has been gained, and the masses in the old liberated areas, especially the emancipated masses, have established the concept of "sons and brothers of the people." No matter how heavy the logistics work is, it has never affected the people's enthusiasm for helping the army. The new areas have also changed their old perception of the army. The enthusiastic movement to send sons and brothers to join the army last year is proof of this. In the old areas, with the development of production mutual aid organizations, the system of plowing on behalf of military families has become more institutionalized. The land of military families has mostly become the public land of mutual aid organizations, and the farmers of the mutual aid groups are collectively responsible for cultivating it, changing the initial temporary support phenomenon of the Anti-Japanese Resistance Work Teams assigning people to plow on behalf of military families. Especially during the emancipation movement, demobilized soldiers and military families in both new and old areas received special care. For example, Dongguan in Heshun and other places specifically set aside a portion of the fruit to establish cooperatives for demobilized soldiers and military families, dedicated to solving their production difficulties. However, this work still has shortcomings, such as: some areas still do not pay enough attention to the production and construction of homes for military families and demobilized soldiers, resulting in some demobilized soldiers and military families not keeping pace with the masses in terms of living standards; insufficient respect for their political status; and the logistics work in various places still not keeping up with the needs of the war. This is mainly due to the brief period of peace after the counter-offensive, which led to a lack of attention to this work by the leadership in various places, while the old areas believed that the plowing on behalf of military families in the villages was no longer a problem, and therefore, inspection was insufficient. Based on this, the meeting decided that everything is for the victory of self-defense, and this year, all regions should thoroughly carry out this work. It should focus on ideological education for the people, further establish the concept of "sons and brothers of the people," strengthen care and assistance to the army, and make logistics work more scientific. The work of giving preferential treatment in the villages should be implemented throughout the year, paying attention to solving practical difficulties, especially to enable demobilized soldiers and military families to become prosperous in this year's major production campaign. They should be frequently comforted and their status respected. The relationship between demobilized soldiers and the villages should be educated on both sides, with mutual respect. The experience of Linxian and Licheng in grasping active demobilized soldiers, inspiring their self-awareness, and solving problems from within is worth emulating in other regions. Secondly, regarding the issue of strengthening cadre work: it was decided to vigorously cultivate and promote worker-peasant cadres, especially activists in the emancipation movement, to strengthen administrative efficiency in the future. The Administrative Office will set up cadre training classes. At the same time, attention should be paid to overcoming the Li Zicheng mentality of administrative cadres and taking care of their reasonable demands. Special care should be given to cadres in border areas. The meeting finally formulated and adopted supplementary regulations on giving preferential treatment to military families, and resettling and providing pensions to demobilized soldiers.

　　太行召开民政科长会议
    加强今年拥优工作
    协助荣退军与军属生产致富
    【本报太行十七日电】太行行署于一月九日召开各专、市民政科长会议，并有涉县、林县、黎城、潞城、临城、长治六县民政科长参加。会议中心为检查与加强各地拥军优军工作及干部工作。会议历时廿天，会上根据各地调查材料，首先肯定太行区历年拥军优军是有成绩的。并已取得丰富经验，老解放区群众，特别是翻身群众，均已确立了“子弟兵”观念，无论后勤工作如何繁重，从未影响人民对军队帮助的热情。新区亦改变了从来对军队的旧观念，去年各地掀起的热烈的送子弟参军运动即为明证。优军工作在老区随着生产互助组织的发展，代耕更加制度化，军属土地多已成为互助组织的公地，互助组的农民集体为之负责耕种，改变了初期临时由抗勤拨人代耕的支应现象。特别是在翻身运动中，无论新老区荣退军人与军属都获得特别照顾，如和顺东关等地特从果实中抽出一部成立荣军与军属的合作社，专为他们生产解决困难。但这一工作仍有缺点，如：部分地区对军属、荣军、生产建家注意仍不够，致部分荣军、军属生活仍赶不上群众；对他们的政治地位尊重不够；以及各地后勤工作仍赶不上战争的需要等，主要由于反攻后的一度和平空气，致各地领导上对这一工作注意差，老区则认为村中代耕已不成问题，因而检查不够。据此，会议决定：一切为了自卫胜利，今年各地应彻底作好这一工作。着重对人民作思想教育，进一步确立“子弟兵”观念，加强爱护与帮助军队，使后勤工作科学化。村中优待工作应贯彻全年，注意解决实际困难，特别要使荣军与军属在今年大生产中发家致富。经常安慰他们与尊重其地位。荣军与村中关系应教育双方，互相尊重。林县、黎城掌握荣军积极分子，启发其自觉，从其内部解决问题的经验值得各地效法。其次，关于加强干部工作问题：决定大力培养与提拔工农干部，特别是翻身运动中的积极分子，以加强今后的行政效率。行署将设立干部学习班。同时对行政干部应注意克服其李自成思想与照顾其合理要求。尤应对边地干部关心照顾。会议最后制定与通过了优军与军属、安置与优恤荣军的补充规定。
