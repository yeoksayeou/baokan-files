　　Looking at Zhao Hengcheng After Three Years
    Yi Geng
    Zhao Hengcheng is a poor village in the fourth district of Chengci. The whole village has 86 households with 448 people, and 713 mu of land, averaging 1.5 mu per person. There are no landlords or rich peasants. Eight households, consisting of 30 people, are destitute, possessing only 1.3 mu of land. Walking through the village, you won't find a single brick house. Among the 86 households, 45 are tenant farmers. Forty-two people have left their homes and gone to Manchuria and Ningxia to sell their labor, and 11 of them even left their bones in Ningxia. Eight people went to the Northeast; three died there. The rest do some small business, carrying coal in the winter and watermelons, pears, and dates in the summer, earning enough for one meal at a time. Mao Zhaiyou, who has been a hired laborer for 42 years, said: "The rich eat three meals a day, while we eat one meal at a time." It is said that 73 years ago (Guangxu 4th year), Zhao Hengcheng had many households with 180 mu or 20-30 mu of land; the whole village had about 30 qing of land. After four droughts and insect plagues, the peasants couldn't survive, and most of the land was cheaply taken by the landlord Wang Hengcheng. The landlord Wang Hengcheng not only took advantage of the disasters to oppress the peasants and seize large amounts of land, but also stipulated that peasants "sell the land but not the grain," meaning that the buyer of the land would not bear any land tax or donations, which would still be paid by the seller. How could the peasants not become poorer generation after generation? During the enemy and puppet regime's rule, in addition to the land taxes, the peasants were subjected to looting by the enemy and puppets, resulting in family ruin. In seven or eight years, more than 100 mu of good land was transferred to the landlords of Wang Hengcheng, Xi Erzu, and Lujiazhuang villages. Until before liberation, Zhao Hengcheng still paid the grain tax for 2 qing of land out of the village's 7 qing of land. Mao Qingyou said: "If the Eighth Route Army had come three years later, this village would have been scattered." After the liberation of Chengci, Zhao Hengcheng, through the movement of increasing investment to redeem land, redeemed 89 mu of land from Wang Hengcheng, Lujiazhuang, Xi Erzu, and other villages; but this was like a drop in the bucket, and hundreds of peasants still couldn't turn themselves around. Last autumn, when the great turn-over movement began, the peasants of Zhao Hengcheng prepared to jointly advance towards the feudal fortresses of the outer villages to recover their land. At the joint struggle meeting in Wang Hengcheng, 70 out of 380 people who spoke out about their grievances were from Zhao Hengcheng. Zhao Hengcheng became a model village with the closest unity in the northern district's struggle.
    The landlords and despots were overthrown, and the peasants of Zhao Hengcheng were liberated. They recovered 196 mu of land from Wang Hengcheng, 263 mu of land from Xi Erzu, and a waterwheel. After the land was fairly distributed, the landless and land-poor peasants were all promoted to middle peasants, with an average of 3.1 mu of land per person. All 86 peasant households in the village joined the Peasant Association. For many years, they were slaves to the land, but now they have become the masters of the land.
    After the victory, Zhao Hengcheng held a "think-think meeting." The peasants realized that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao were their loved ones. Without the Communist Party, they would not have been able to turn themselves around. Zhao Zhixin said painfully: "My grandfather, uncle, and brother starved to death, a total of three people. My wife and children were so hungry that they couldn't get up. We couldn't borrow even a grain of rice from the landlord..." He shed tears as he spoke, and everyone in the audience was moved to tears. But when he spoke of being able to speak in front of people as the village head and the district representative after turning over, he was filled with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy, and he spontaneously sang a song: "This year is the 35th year of the Republic of China. The peasants are united to fight the landlords, fight the landlords and traitors. The broad masses of the people have turned themselves around. After turning around, we engage in large-scale production and practice diligence and frugality to help the front lines. The poor Zhao Hengcheng has land, and the peasants must cultivate the land well so that they have food and clothing." They unanimously issued a production challenge to the rich village of Wang Hengcheng, saying: "Look at Zhao Hengcheng again in three years."

　　三年后再看赵横城
    亦耕
    赵横城是成磁四区一个穷村子。全村八十六户，四百四十八口人，土地七百一十三亩，平均每人一亩半地，没有一家地主富农，八户赤贫三十口人，仅有土地一亩三分，走过该村找不见一座砖瓦院。在八十六户居民中，有四十五家雇佃农，有的背井离乡，到关外和到宁夏卖劳力的有四十二人，其中十一人连骨头也扔在宁夏了。去东三省的有八个人，有三个人死在那里，其余的都兼做些小买卖，冬天驮炭夏天驮西瓜梨枣，赚一顿吃一顿。当了四十二年雇工的毛宅有说：“富人一天吃三顿，咱们是有一顿吃一顿”。据说七十三年前（光绪四年），赵横城多是一顷八十亩或二、三十亩地的住户，全村约有三十顷地，经四次旱灾虫灾，农民没法生活，大部分土地都为王横城的地主贱价剥去。如毛宅有家卖了三十多亩，王炳臣卖了八十亩。王横城地主，不仅乘灾荒压迫农民，大量吞并土地，且给农民规定“卖地不卖粮”，这即是买地人不负担一切田赋捐税，仍由卖地户完纳，这样农民怎能不一辈穷一辈呢？在敌伪统治时期，除按地派征外，又加以敌伪抢掠，农民家破人亡，七八年间即有百多亩好地转入王横城、西二祖、吕家庄等三村地主手里。直到解放前，赵横城全村七顷多地仍拿了二顷地的差粮，毛庆有说：“八路军再晚来三年，这个村就散了。”成磁解放后，赵横城经过增资赎地运动，从王横城、吕家庄、西二祖等村，赎回土地八十九亩；滴水不解渴，几百个农民仍翻不了身。去年秋天大翻身运动开始，赵横城农民就准备向外村封建堡垒联合进军，收回自己的土地。在王横城联合斗争大会上，三百八十个诉苦人中，赵横城就有七十人。赵横城成为北小区斗争中团结最紧的模范村。
    地主恶霸斗倒了，赵横城农民翻身了，从王横城收回土地一百九十六亩，从西二祖收回土地二百六十三亩，还有一辆水车。土地公平分配后，无地和少地的赤贫农都上升为中农，每人平均地到三亩一分，全村八十六户农民参加了农会，多年来他们做土地的奴隶，现在成了土地的主人。
    胜利后，赵横城召开了个想想会，农民们认识到共产党毛主席是自己的亲人，没有共产党就翻不了身，赵致信沉痛的说：“我爷爷、叔叔、哥哥三辈饿死三口人，老婆孩子饿的躺下起不来，向地主借一粒米也借不出来………。”说着流下泪，全场人都感动得哭了；但当他说到翻了身当了村长和小区代表在人前能讲话时，又悲喜交集热情振奋，他随口唱出一段歌来：“今年民国三十五，农民团结起来斗地主，斗地主斗汉奸，广大人民把身翻，翻了身大生产，勤俭节约帮前线；穷破的赵横城有了地，农民倒要把土地耕种好，有吃有穿。”他们一致向富村王横城提出生产挑战，他们说：“三年后再看赵横城”。
