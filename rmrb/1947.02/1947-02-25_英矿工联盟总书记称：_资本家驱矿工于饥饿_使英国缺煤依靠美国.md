　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 23rd: A delayed report from London states that the General Secretary of the British National Union of Mineworkers, Arthur Horner, said in a speech on the 17th that certain supporters of Franco should be held responsible for the current situation in Britain. Capitalists have driven miners from the coal pits into years of starvation, which is why there is not enough manpower to mine the coal the country needs so desperately. Britain needs to be able to produce 50 million tons, so that it does not need to rely on the United States. Capitalists improving coal production is the way to liberate themselves from the misfortune of becoming the 49th state of the United States. But, they should use British people to mine coal, not Polish people, nor any European immigrants. Furthermore, a news reporter stationed in Vienna said: Three members of Parliament (Labor MP Hodson and two Conservatives) who visited refugee camps in Austria housing European refugees, opposed bringing these refugees back to Britain to work. Hodson's opinion is that most of these people are not suitable for industrial work, or have not been trained for such work, and most of them have been infected by fascist propaganda.

　　英矿工联盟总书记称：
    资本家驱矿工于饥饿
    使英国缺煤依靠美国
    【新华社延安二十三日电】伦敦迟到消息，英全国矿工联盟总书记霍尔炳于十七日演说称：某些支持佛朗哥的人，应对目前英国之局势负责。资本家已将矿工自地窖中赶入饥饿的岁月中，这就是为什么没有足够的人力来采国家更需要的煤的原因。英国是需要能有五千万吨的产出，也就可以不依靠美国。资本家改进煤的生产，是从来为美国第四十九州的厄运中解放出来的办法。但是，他们要以英国人去采煤，而不是以波兰人，也不是什么欧洲移民。又新闻驻维也纳记者说：三个参观奥地利境欧洲多难民集中营的国会议员（工党荷逊及保守党二人），反对将这些移难民带回英国工作。荷逊的意见是这些人大部分不适于工业工作，或未受该项工作的训练，而且大部分是受过法西斯宣传感染的。
