    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 11th: Associated Press, Shanghai, February 8th: The entire economy of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist China is collapsing, and a very real danger has emerged as the legal tender continues to plummet. This morning, one US dollar was exchanged for 11,000 legal tender, which is 1,000 more than yesterday. Dissatisfaction with the government's policies is growing among business circles, who bitterly point out that every step the government takes to stabilize the economic situation seems to inevitably have the opposite effect. They cite Song Ziwen's measures announced on the 5th (regarding foreign exchange controls on import and export goods) as a typical example at hand. The immediate effect of these measures has been a sharp rise in living expenses and prices. Some commodities have doubled in price since Wednesday. Eating a steak in a restaurant costs twice as much as before the order was issued, clothes have increased by one and a half times, and haircuts, car rentals, etc., are all experiencing the same situation. Most businessmen point out that the legal tender must seek its own standard, and trade must be open rather than mechanically controlled, in order to encourage exports and reduce imports. All observers agree that the current collapse of the legal tender cannot continue for long without serious consequences. Many stores will not be able to maintain themselves and will close down, and the number of unemployed will increase. People at cocktail parties have already begun to talk about the possibility of riots, and even whisper their fear of revolution. The opinion of some Chinese and foreigners is becoming increasingly clear: they believe that a sweeping "purge" is an effective medicine for a weakened China; they even say: "Unless some dignitaries are purged, it will be of no use." Their theory is "to sacrifice one hundred people to save 500 million people." Merchants generally hope that Nanjing and Yan'an will reconcile and form a coalition government, which they believe is the only way to restore China's vitality. It is generally believed that foreign loans are impossible at the current stage of the civil war and continued economic deterioration. China needs peace first before the destroyed economic institutions can be restored.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 11th: The "Export Promotion Committee," which monopolizes China's export trade by the Four Families, is being organized. According to reports in the Tianjin Dagongbao on the 29th of last month and the 2nd of this month: after the establishment of the committee, the first batch of exports will be worth 50 million US dollars. The method of unified purchase and sales of special products is similar to that implemented during the Anti-Japanese War. The Central Trust Bureau has been ordered to purchase special products such as raw silk, tea, bristles, and tung oil. The price of Tianjin bristles has risen due to the Central Trust Bureau's large-scale purchases, from 23,000 yuan to 26,500 yuan per catty, and there is no supply in the market. Even an offer of 30,000 yuan has no sellers.

    四大家族残酷搜刮
    蒋区经济面临总崩溃
    人们已开始谈论暴动的可能性
    【新华社延安十一日电】美联社上海八日电：蒋介石的国民党中国整个经济崩溃，由于法币继续狂跌，已显现了极其真正的危险。今晨美钞一元兑换法币一万一千元，较昨日高出一千元。商业界对政府的政策不满的情绪日益增涨，并沉痛指出政府企图稳定经济情况所采取的每一步骤，似乎不可避免要造成相反的效果。他们以五日宋子文所颁布的措施（关于进出口货外汇管制者）作为眼前的典型例子。这些措施的即时效果，便是生活费用与物价急剧上涨，好些商品从星期三起已涨价一倍，到餐馆吃牛排要付出颁布命令前的两倍价钱，衣服涨价一倍半，剪发、租汽车等等均有同样情形。大部分商人指出，法币必须寻求其自身标准，贸易必须公开，而不机械的管制，这样才能达到鼓励出口减低进口的目的。一切观察家均同意，目前法币暴跌，不可能长久继续而无严重后果，许多商店将不能维持下去而倒闭，失业人数将增加。人们在鸡尾酒会上已开始谈论暴动的可能性，甚至低语着表示害怕会有革命。一部分中外人士的意见日益明显，他们认为一个扫除性的“清洗”才是对虚弱中国的有效药；他们甚至说：“除非清洗到某些达官贵人，还不会有用处。他们的理论是“以一百人的牺牲来救五万万人民”。商人总希望南京与延安和解组成联合政府，他们认为这是使中国恢复元气的唯一办法。一般认为，在内战进行、经济状态继续恶化的现阶段，希望外国借款是不可能的。在破坏了的经济机构恢复前，中国首先需要和平。
    【新华社延安十一日电】四大家垄断中国出口贸易之“输出推广委员会”在进行组织中。综合上月二十九日及本月二日天津大公报消息：该会成立后，第一批输出价值美金五千万元。特产出口统购统销办法与抗战期间所实施者相似。中央信托局已奉令收购生丝、茶叶、猪鬃、桐油等特产，津市猪鬃价格已因中信局大量收购而上涨，每斤由二万三千元涨至二万六千五百元，并有市无货，出价三万元仍无卖主。
