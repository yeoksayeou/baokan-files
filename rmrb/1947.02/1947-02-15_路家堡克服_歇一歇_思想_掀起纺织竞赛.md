    Lujiabao Overcomes "Take a Break" Mentality
    Launches Textile Competition
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] On January 31st, Lujiabao village discussed spring textile work. After precise calculations: the village has 973 people, and on average each person needs one zhang of cloth for the change of seasons in spring, totaling 973 zhang of cloth. To ensure everyone has cloth for the change of seasons without buying it, it is necessary to greatly develop spring textiles. However, some individuals developed a "take a break" mentality after reviewing the quotas. After Liu Wenping explained the situation to everyone: "One jin of cotton costs 300 yuan on the market, and one chi of cloth costs 200 yuan; one jin of cotton can be woven into seven chi of cloth, worth 1400 yuan, enough to buy 23 jin of cotton with two sales." Everyone's thinking was clarified, and they immediately reorganized 24 textile groups with 203 female spinners. There were originally 48 looms, and the plan is to convert 22 of them into hand-pulled shuttle looms and make another 13;改造eight two-wheeled spinning wheels; and develop 31 more female spinners. The plan is that within 100 days, each person will spin two liang per day for the first 30 days, and then three liang thereafter, which will surely complete 10,762.5 chi of cloth, with a surplus of 1,032.5 chi of cloth after self-use. Everyone set out competition conditions, with monthly exhibitions of finished products, inspections every ten days, and exchange of experiences. (Joint Office)

    路家堡克服“歇一歇”思想
    掀起纺织竞赛
    【本报黎城讯】一月三十一日，路家堡村讨论春季纺织工作，经过精确计算：村九百七十三人，春天换季平均每人一丈，共需布九百七十三丈。要做到人人换季，不买布，必需大量发展春季纺织。但个别人查减后产生“歇一歇”思想。经刘文屏向大家算账：“集上每斤花三百元，布一尺二百元；一斤花能织成七尺布，得一千四百元，倒两次就能买二十三斤花”。大家思想通了，立刻整顿起二十四个纺织组，有纺妇二百零三名。原有织机四十八架，计划把其中二十二架改成手拉梭机，再做十三架；改造两轮纺车八辆；再发展纺妇三十一人。计划一百天内，前三十天每人每天纺二两，以后三两，保险能完成布一万零七百六十二尺半，自用外余布一千零三十二尺半。大家订出竞赛条件，每月底展览一次成品，十天检查一次，交流经验。    （联办室）
