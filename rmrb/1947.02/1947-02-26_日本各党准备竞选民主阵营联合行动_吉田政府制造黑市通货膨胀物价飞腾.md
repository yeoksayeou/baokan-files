Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 22nd: Nanjing dispatch: Japanese political parties are actively preparing for the general election to be held on April 25th. In view of the possibility that conservative parties may unite to form a new party to control the general election, Japanese democratic parties are planning countermeasures. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, Japan's two major labor unions (the Federation of Industrial Organizations, with a total of 1.7 million members, and the All-Japan Labor Federation, with 1 million members) have planned to unite to support the "Democratic United Front" to fight against the conservative parties represented by the current Yoshida cabinet. The two labor unions plan to only support those candidates who agree to support the labor platform and will not limit the supply of campaign funds to these candidates.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 22nd: United Press Tokyo dispatch: Japan may immediately face an economic situation as chaotic as China's. All the corrupt bureaucrats in the Japanese government itself violate the economic regulations they issue, engaging in the black market and manipulating transportation, thereby increasing the severity of the economic situation. Today's Japanese black market has become regularized, and spiraling inflation is rising higher and faster. The amount of currency in circulation has increased from 60 billion yen to 100 billion yen in four months.

　　日本各党准备竞选民主阵营联合行动
    吉田政府制造黑市通货膨胀物价飞腾
    【新华社延安二十二日电】南京讯：日本各党派正积极准备四月廿五日举行之大选。鉴于保守党派有联合成一新党以把持大选之可能，日本各民主党派正筹划应付之策。据每日新闻载称：日本两大工会（总共有会员一百七十万的产业工会联合会，与拥有会员一百万的全日劳工联合会）已计划团结一致，支持“民主联合阵线”以进行反对吉田现内阁所代表的保守政党的斗争。该两工会计划，仅拥护那些同意支持劳工纲领的候选人，并将不限制供给这种候选人以竞选基金。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】合众社东京讯：日本或将立即面临着与中国相比的脱的混乱的经济情况，日本政府本身中一切的腐朽的官僚均违反他们自己发布的经济法规，从事黑市并操纵运输，从而增加了经济情况的严重性。今日日本的黑市已成规律，是螺旋性的通货膨胀愈升愈高，愈升愈快。按四个月中货币流通量，自六百亿日元，增至一千亿日元。
