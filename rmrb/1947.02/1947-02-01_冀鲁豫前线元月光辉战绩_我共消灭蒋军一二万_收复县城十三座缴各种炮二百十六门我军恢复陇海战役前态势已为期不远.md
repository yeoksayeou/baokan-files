　　JiluYu Front's Brilliant January Victory
    Our Army Annihilated 12,000 Chiang Troops
    Recaptured 13 County Towns, Seized 216 Cannons of Various Types. Our Army is Not Far From Restoring the Situation Before the Longhai Campaign.
    [Report from Our JiluYu Front, 30th] The Field Headquarters of the JinjiLuYu Military Region recently announced the glorious achievements of the JiluYu Self-Defense Front in January: (1) Recaptured 13 county towns, namely Liancheng, Fanxian, Guancheng, Puxian, Nanle, Qingfeng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Chengwu, Dingtao, Caoxian, Shanxian, and Woyang. (2) Killed and wounded over 5,000 Chiang and puppet troops, including Zhi Yongde (puppet Chengwu county magistrate and concurrently head of the security regiment) and Shi Fuqi (Dingtao security regiment head). (3) Captured Xie Maoquan (Brigade Commander of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division), Zhu Qingchuan (Major General Senior Advisor of the Third Column of the Ministry of National Defense, formerly Deputy Chief of Staff of the Puppet Nanjing Military Commission), Wei Xizhou (Chief of the Staff Office of the Third Column of the Ministry of National Defense, formerly Deputy Division Commander of the 17th Division), Fu Ziqin (Deputy Commander of the Third Detachment of the Third Column of the Ministry of National Defense), Wang Baode (Deputy Commander and concurrently Chief of Staff of the Caoxian Security Brigade), Zhou Jue (Regimental Commander of the 280th Regiment of the 140th Brigade of the 70th Division), Song Junsan (Regimental Commander of the First Regiment of the Second Detachment of the Third Column of the Ministry of National Defense), Wang Longyang (Caoxian Security Regiment Head), and Pang Shaoxu (Deputy Regimental Commander of the 428th Regiment of the 143rd Brigade of the 68th Division), Zhao Yu San (Deputy Regimental Commander of the 63rd Regiment of the 21st Brigade of the 88th Division), and other 25,500 people. (4) Seized 8 mountain guns, 6 anti-tank guns, 69 mortars, 133 60mm mortars, 92 grenade launchers, 190 heavy machine guns, 732 light machine guns, 12,386 rifles, 70 pistols, 8 submachine guns and automatic rifles, 50 submachine guns, 17 trucks, 174 war horses, 332,000 rounds of ammunition, 950 various shells, 3,406 hand grenades, 14 radio stations, 22 telephones, 2 gun-making devices, and countless other spoils of war.
    [Report from Our JiluYu Front, 29th] Xinhua News Agency reporters recently published a commentary on the glorious victory of General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army in the JiluYu Front, which recovered 13 county towns in 26 days, stating: Two months ago, General Liu Bocheng, in a conversation with reporters from this agency, summarized that from mid-August to mid-November, Chiang Kai-shek sacrificed 60,000 troops at the cost of occupying 17 empty cities, averaging exactly 3,530 people per city. From New Year's Day to January 26, General Liu Bocheng recovered 13 county towns in 26 days, killing, wounding, and capturing 30,500 Chiang troops, with Chiang Kai-shek losing an average of 2,346 men for each county town recovered. For each gain and loss of a county town, Chiang Kai-shek must write off 5,876 men on his general ledger. This interesting account is worth calculating by anyone with a sense of mathematics to see how many more times Chiang Kai-shek's total strength can be written off. General Liu pointed out two months ago that the victory or defeat of war does not depend on the gain or loss of a city or a place, but on the preservation or loss of the main force. He said: "If you save the men and lose the land, the land can eventually be regained. If you save the land and lose the men, you will inevitably lose both men and land." He also pointed out that when the main force of the Chiang army is eliminated to a certain extent, the Chiang army will not only be unable to attack but also unable to defend. Under the attack of finding superior forces, they will eventually spit out all the occupied towns. The facts currently occurring on the JiluYu battlefield have confirmed and realized all that General Liu said two months ago. Just look, how long ago was it that the vast land south of the Yellow River, north of Longhai, and west of Jinpu in JiluYu, which was once ravaged by Chiang Kai-shek's superior forces, only had seven isolated cities, Heze, Jining, Jinxiang, Yutai, Fengxian, Peixian and Dongming, exposed to the direct encirclement and threat of General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army. Our army is not far from completely restoring the situation before the Longhai Campaign in August last year.

　　冀鲁豫前线元月光辉战绩
    我共消灭蒋军一二万
    收复县城十三座缴各种炮二百十六门我军恢复陇海战役前态势已为期不远
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三十日电】晋冀鲁豫军区野战司令部顷公布冀鲁豫自卫前线元月份辉煌战果：（一）收复县城十三座，计联城、范县、观城、濮县、南乐、清丰、巨野、嘉祥、城武、定陶、曹县、单县、涡阳。（二）毙伤蒋伪军智永德（伪城武县长兼保安团长）、石福起（定陶保安团长）以下五千余名。（三）俘谢懋权（七十师一百四十旅旅长）、祝晴川（国防部第三纵队少将高级总参议，曾任伪南京军事委员会参谋次长）、魏西周（国防部三纵队参谋处长，曾任十七师副师长）、傅子琴（国防部第三纵队第三支队副司令）、王宝德（曹县保安旅副司令兼参谋长）、周觉（七十师一百四十旅二八○团团长）、宋俊三（国防部第三纵队第二支队第一团团长）、王龙养（曹县保安团长）及庞绍绪（六十八师一四三旅四二八团副团长）、赵钰三（八十八师二十一旅六十三团副团长）等以下两万五千五百余名。（四）缴获山炮八门，战防炮六门，迫击炮六十九门，六○炮一百三十三门，掷弹筒九十二个，重机枪一百九十挺，轻机枪七百三十二挺，步枪一万二千三百八十六枝，短枪七十枝，手提式及自动步枪八枝，冲锋枪五十枝，汽车十七辆，战马一百七十四匹，子弹三十三万二千发，各种炮弹九百五十发，手榴弹三千四百零六个，电台十四部，电话机二十二架，造枪器两部，其他胜利品无算。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十九日电】新华社记者顷就冀鲁豫前线刘伯承将军所部常胜军二十六天内收复十三座县城的光辉胜利发表评论称：两个月前，刘伯承将军对本社记者发表谈话时，总结了由八月中旬到十一月中旬三个月内，蒋介石牺牲六万兵力的代价，占去我十七座空城，恰好每座城平均花费三千五百三十人的代价。由元旦起到一月二十六日止，刘伯承将军在二十六天内收复十三座县城，毙伤俘蒋军三万零五百人，平均每收复一个县城蒋介石又损失两千三百四十六名，蒋介石对每座县城一得一失就要在他的总账上报销五千八百七十六名。这一笔有趣的账，值得每一个对数学感趣味的人去算一算，看一看蒋介石的总兵力还能报销多少次。刘将军两月前曾指出：战争之胜负不在一城一地之得失，而决定于主力的保存或丧失，他说：“存人失地，地终可得，存地失人，必将人地皆失。”并指出蒋军主力在消灭到一定程度时，蒋军将不仅无力进攻，也将无力可守，在找优势兵力攻击之下，终必将所占城镇全部吐出。目前冀鲁豫战场上所发生的事实，已将刘将军两个月以前所说的话全部证实与实现。试看曾几何时，一度为蒋介石优势兵力所蹂躏过的冀鲁豫黄河以南、陇海以北、津浦以西的广大土地，仅余荷泽、济宁、金乡、鱼台、丰县、沛县和东明等七座孤城暴露在刘伯承将军所部常胜军直接围困与威胁之下，我军完全恢复去年八月间陇海战役以前的态势，已为期不远。
