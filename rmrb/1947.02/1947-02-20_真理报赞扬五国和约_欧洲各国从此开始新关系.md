　　*Pravda* Praises Five-Power Treaty
    European Nations Begin New Relations

    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th】TASS reports: *Pravda* recently commented on the signing of the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, stating: This is an extraordinary event of our era. It indicates that relations between European countries are beginning a new historical period. It facilitates the restoration of normalcy in this part of Europe, and the development and improvement of friendly relations between countries. The newspaper continued: Although this treaty cannot completely satisfy all parties involved, it is the best treaty that can be achieved at this stage. The newspaper also stated: The signed treaties must be resolutely and unswervingly implemented. The anger of the fascist disciples and grandchildren towards the treaty is natural; their conspiracies have recently been exposed in Italy, Hungary, Finland, and Austria. The newspaper stated: This is why strict adherence to the treaty is of great importance, as it will help eliminate fascist remnants and consolidate the foundations of democracy.
