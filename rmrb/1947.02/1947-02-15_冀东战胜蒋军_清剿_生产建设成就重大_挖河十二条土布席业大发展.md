    Eastern Hebei Wins Victory Over Chiang Kai-shek's Army's "Encirclement and Suppression"
    Major Achievements in Production and Construction
    Twelve Rivers Dredged, Significant Development in Native Cloth and Mat Industries
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rehe-Liaoning, 11th] Despite being subjected to division and "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang Kai-shek's army, the Eastern Hebei liberated area still achieved significant accomplishments in production and construction last year, comparable to those in guerrilla warfare. The entire region universally managed water and repaired dikes, dredging a total of twelve rivers, involving a total of 52,200,000 cubic feet of earthwork (each cubic foot being one zhang in length, width, and height), and employing 947,200 laborers. Thirteen counties and over a thousand villages benefited. In the textile industry, according to statistics from eight counties, there were 200,941 spinning wheels and 17,997 looms. A survey of fifteen villages in Kuandi alone showed that the number of spinning wheels increased from ninety-six in the spring and summer to fifty at the end of the year. According to statistics from July of last year, there were a total of 281 cooperatives. The administrative office of the region issued a total of 500 million yuan in agricultural and textile loans in the spring and winter seasons last year. In order to launch a large-scale production campaign, it plans to issue another 10,000 dans of grain and goods this spring. In addition to native cloth being the main trade, the mat and paper industries have also greatly developed in the region. In areas such as Guonancang in Yutian, the development of the mat industry has ensured the livelihood of 70,000 people in reed-growing areas. Most of the Changlu salt flats in Eastern Hebei have been destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's army, but our people have secured hundreds of salt flats, producing over 12 million catties of salt, and will add several more salt flats this year.
