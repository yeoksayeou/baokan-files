    Shang Qingfu's Flying Demolition Team possesses two skills - sniping and laying mines. These unpredictable tactics make the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops fearful. A company commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Hongtong once wrote a letter to Shang Qingfu to negotiate terms, saying, "I am willing to remain neutral and not hinder your actions; I only hope your guns are not aimed at us." But Shang Qingfu did not relax his vigilance against the enemy because of this.

    Last autumn, the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded the Hongtong Liberated Area, approaching Quting. Shang Qingfu led his demolition team to lay more than eighty mines in Quting. Later, he ambushed the enemy in Shangzhang. Although this place was only separated from Quting by a ditch, the enemy did not dare to cross the ditch rashly. Shang Qingfu also laid more than thirty excellent mines at night. The following ballad records the scene at that time: "Landmines are strange, the militia arranges them well." "Taitou Jianxi" rings when the door opens, "Left and Right Immortals" report good news. If the Chiang Kai-shek troops dare to come in, barging in will surely result in broken legs and missing heads.

    It only took them forty minutes to bury more than thirty mines. At dawn, they were all moved to Shicun. On this day, the Chiang Kai-shek army again attacked along the line of Shicun, Quting, Yuanshang, and Zhangcun. After the Chiang Kai-shek army arrived at Shicun, Shang Qingfu firmly ordered his men to disperse, fight on their own, not suffer losses, and gather in Baicun after the battle. The militiamen, like sparrows in twos and threes, looked for targets on a fifteen-mile line from east to west, using cold shots to strike the enemy. The Chiang Kai-shek army's engineers, who stubbornly entered Quting, only removed five mines in two hours, thinking everything was fine. Who knew that countless mines were waiting for them in unexpected places. A Chiang Kai-shek soldier entered a farmer's house to rob things, triggering a drawer, and with a "boom," he was blown to pieces. A Chiang Kai-shek platoon leader walked to the entrance of the district office and encountered "Open Door Luck," and the platoon leader was also blown to smithereens. The Chiang Kai-shek army suffered a total of sixteen casualties this day.

    When the Chiang Kai-shek army retreated, Shang Qingfu's demolition team advanced to the Tongpu line to launch a transportation war. On November 27, they arrived on the Linhong Highway west of Fengzhang Village and saw two Chiang Kai-shek vehicles driving north. At that moment, cold shots rang out, and the drivers, seeing the situation was not good, abandoned their vehicles and fled. At this time, Gan Bu and Jian Qiao reinforced with more than seventy Chiang Kai-shek troops, and Shang Qingfu's demolition team was caught in a pincer attack from the north and south. He fired a few shots to create a diversion and quickly retreated from the side, while the two Chiang Kai-shek forces engaged in a fierce battle in the village for an hour, both sides suffering more than twenty casualties. By the end of the battle, they realized they were their own people.

    On December 15, Shang Qingfu's men ambushed in the trenches on both sides of the Dongbaotou Highway, and four more Chiang Kai-shek vehicles drove from the south. They rushed up and threw grenades into the cars like rain. The first vehicle escaped with corpses. Shang Qingfu became anxious, grabbed a machine gun and shot the driver of the second vehicle in the middle of the road. The machine gunner was killed, and the car stopped like a dead reptile. They captured an American-style submachine gun, two barrels of gasoline, and 120,000 legal tender. From then on, the Chiang Kai-shek army dared not take the Linhong Highway easily. They were terrified by Shang Qingfu's demolition team.

    Shang Qingfu's reputation has long been a sensation throughout the area. In 1934, he was elected as a hero in killing the enemy at the Taiyue District Mass Congress. Today, he is as brave and good at fighting as ever, wearing a hero's knot on his head and a gray coarse cloth short coat, looking heroic. He is from a village in Hongtong, extremely poor and landless. He worked as a shop assistant in a mule and horse shop at the age of fourteen, and later as a hired worker. Last year, he was allocated twelve mu of land, a small manor, and two dan of grain. He is resilient and hardworking, so he can become stronger and stronger in battle. Chiang Kai-shek's army broke into our land and trampled on his happy life. He wants to defend the land and defend the glory of eight years of struggle. Speaking of him, one must connect him with the demolition team. Who in Hongtong does not praise their bravery and thank them for defending their homeland?

    尚清福飞行爆炸队

    尚清福飞行爆炸队有两套本领——冷枪与埋雷。这种神出鬼没的战术，使进犯蒋军个个胆怯。洪洞蒋军某连长曾写信给尚清福讲条件。说：“我愿意保守中立不妨碍你的行动；但愿你的枪口别对准我们。”但尚清福并没有因此松懈对敌的警惕。
    去年秋天，蒋军侵犯洪洞解放区，逼近曲亭，尚清福带着爆炸队在曲亭埋雷八十除颗，后在上张阻击敌人，此处与曲亭不过一沟之隔，敌人却不敢冒然过沟。尚清福又在夜里埋了三十多颗出色的雷。下面一段歌谣记载当时情景说：“地雷是个怪，民兵好安排”。“台头见喜”开门响，“左右仙童”报喜来。蒋军大胆开进来，闯进来管叫你断腿缺脑袋。
    他们埋三十多颗雷，只需四十分钟。天明就都移到师村去了。蒋军这天又向师村、曲亭、原上、张村一线进攻。蒋军到师村后，尚清富坚决命令他的人马散开，各打各的，自己不吃亏，打完敌人柏村集合。民兵像三三两两的麻雀在东西十五里路一条线上，各找对象，以冷枪打击敌人。硬着头皮进入曲亭的蒋军工兵，两个钟头才起掉五个雷，以为万事大吉。谁知还有无数的地雷在意想不到的地方等待着他们。一个蒋军进入一家农民的房子里抢东西，触动抽屉就只“轰”然一声，炸得肢体分裂。一个蒋军排长走进区公所门口，遇上了“开门大吉”，排长也被炸得粉碎。蒋军这天共伤亡十六人。
    蒋军回去时，尚清富爆炸队又挺进同蒲沿线，展开交通战。十一月二十七日，他们到冯张村西的临洪公路上，望见蒋军两辆汽车向北驶来。一时冷枪四起，司机见势不对，丢下汽车逃命去了。此时有甘不、涧桥两个蒋军七十余人增援，尚清富爆炸队陷在南北夹击中，他便虚发几声，迅速的从侧面撤退，而两股蒋军却在村里混战了一小时，双方都伤亡二十余人。到战斗结束时，才知道是自己人。
    十二月十五日，尚清富的人马在董堡头公路两旁壕沟中设伏，又有蒋军四辆汽车由南驶来。他们猛冲上去手榴弹阵雨般扔进车里，第一辆载着死尸逃了过去。尚清富急了，抓起机枪到汽路中间把第二辆汽车司机被俘，机枪手被打死了，车身像死去的爬虫般停下来。缴获一挺美式冲锋机枪，两桶汽油，十二万法币。从此蒋军轻易不敢再走临洪公路，他们被尚清富爆炸队打怕了。
    尚清富的声誉早轰动全区。三十四年太岳区群众大会上被选为昆兵杀敌英雄，如今他英勇善战不减当年，头上扎起英雄结穿一身灰色粗布短衣，英姿凛凛。他是洪洞某村人，赤贫无地，十四岁时当过骡马店的小伙计，以后当过雇工。去年才分到十二亩地，一座小庄园，两石粮食。他坚韧耐劳所以能愈战愈强。蒋介石军队闯进我们土地上，蹂躏了他的幸福生活，他要保卫土地，保卫八年斗争的光荣。说到他就要联系到爆炸队，洪洞人民谁不称赞他们的英勇，感激他们保卫家乡。
