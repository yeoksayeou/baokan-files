    On Zhao Shuli's Novels
    Mao Dun
    Mr. Zhao Shuli experienced the bloody struggle firsthand, and this confession of experience is the novel "Changes in Li Family Village."
    The background is a mountain village in southeastern Shanxi. However, this mountain village is clearly a microcosm of the vast rural areas of northern China, where feudal forces are strongest. In this respect, the "Li Family Village" story has its universal representativeness. However, because it is in Shanxi, and Shanxi has a tumbler-like local warlord who is both greedy and cunning and shameless, and he has his set of deceptive and fraudulent tricks, therefore, the "Li Family Village" story has its own special characteristics in its universality; it not only represents the rural areas of North China, but also truly represents the rural areas of Shanxi that have suffered the deepest deception and oppression. The author unfolds the clues of the story from the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the Republic of China. The local emperor of Li Family Village is the landlord Li Ruzhen. This Li Ruzhen is also a tumbler. In the ten years from the seventeenth and eighteenth years of the Republic of China to the beginning of the War of Resistance, there were many major events in Shanxi, but Li Ruzhen dealt with them freely. When the Japanese came, he of course became a traitor; but what was surprising was that when the Eighth Route Army liberated this mountain village, Li Ruzhen still controlled the fate of all the villagers. It was not until the Eighth Route Army launched a mass movement and truly penetrated the masses that the true face of the old fox was revealed. Thus, the bloody struggle began. On the one hand, there was the Eighth Route Army leading the peasants to resist Japan, and on the other hand, there was the local warlord Yan Xishan and his friendly forces who pretended to resist Japan but were single-mindedly engaged in anti-communism; on the one hand, there were the peasants who demanded to turn over, and on the other hand, there was the landlord Li Ruzhen and his lackeys who could sell everything, but refused to give up his feudal privileges. This struggle was long-term, multi-faceted, and arduous; there were setbacks and sacrifices, but the liberators of the people were good at summing up experiences and lessons, and in the end the people achieved victory. The tumbler Li Ruzhen was finally overthrown, and "Changes in Li Family Village" was completed.
    Mr. Zhao Shuli did not describe the changes in the mountain village without any love or hate. His love and hate are extremely strong and clear. He stands on the side of the people. He does not shy away from the backwardness of the peasants, but what distinguishes him from the intellectuals with a strong petty-bourgeois consciousness is that he does not deny the peasants' strong national consciousness and their clear-cut spirit of struggle because of the peasants' backwardness. In the struggle, the peasants are not only able to overcome their backwardness, but also develop their creative talents. Many writers can accept this truth intellectually, but few writers can give it an image in their works. The biggest reason is that they will not devote themselves to such a real life of struggle, but Mr. Zhao Shuli not only devoted himself to such a struggle, but also embraced the sincerity of learning from the masses.
    "Changes in Li Family Village" is not only a successful novel depicting the life of the liberated areas, but also an example of the high level of literary and artistic works achieved after the "rectification campaign." This excellent work shows how the "rectification campaign" can have a profound influence on the ideological and technical cultivation of a literary and artistic worker. Some of the ideological content has already been discussed above, and now let us just talk about the techniques of this book. To evaluate it in one sentence, it has achieved popularization. There is no superficial piling up, no delicate carving, and the simplicity and醇厚 make the book a commendable success in terms of technique. This is a milestone towards national form, and it is worthy of reference for authors outside the liberated areas. And the acquisition of this technique by Mr. Zhao Shuli, I think there is no secret, just because he lives among the people, works among the people, and learns from the people, and is good at absorbing the essence of the people's lively, simple and figurative language.

    论赵树理的小说
    茅盾
    赵树理先生是在血淋淋的斗争生活中经验过来的，而这经验的告白就是小说《李家庄的变迁》。
    背景是在晋东南的一个山村。然而这山村分明是封建势力最强大的中国北方广大农村的缩影。在这一点上，“李家庄”故事有其普遍的代表性。可是因为在山西，而山西则有不倒翁式的既贪婪又狡猾无耻的地方军阀，他有他那骗人诈人的一套，因此，“李家庄”的故事在普遍性中自有特殊之处；这不仅代表了北巾国的农村，而且确是代表了受欺诈与压迫最深重的山西农村。作者远远地从民国十七八年起，展开了故事的线索。李家庄的土皇帝是大地主李如珍。这李如珍也是个不倒翁。从民国十七八年到抗战初年，这整整十年中，山西经过的大小事情可真不少呢，然而李如珍应付自如，日本人来了他当然做汉奸；可是出奇的是八路军光复了这山村时，他李如珍还是依然掌握着全村农民的命运。待八路军展开了民众运动，切实深入民众，这才把老狐狸的原形照了出来。于是血淋淋的斗争开始了。一方面是领导农民抗战的八路军，一方面是假装抗战而一心一意在那里反共的地方军阀阎锡山及其友军；一方面是要求翻身的农民，一方面是什么都可以出卖，唯独他的封建特权却不肯放弃的地主李如珍及其鹰犬。这斗争是长期的，多变化的，艰苦的；有挫折，有牺牲，然而人民的解放者是善于总结经验教训的，最后是人民得到了胜利。不倒翁李如珍终于被打倒了，《李家庄的变迁》，于是乎完成。
    赵树理先生不是无所容心地来描写山村的变迁的。他的爱憎极为强烈而分明。他站在人民的立场，他不讳饰农民的落后性，然而他和小资产阶级意识极浓厚的知识分子所不同者，即不因农民之落后性而否定了农民之坚强的民族意识及其恩仇分明的斗争精神。在斗争中，农民是不但能够克服了落后性，而且发挥出创造的才能。这一真理，许多作家可以在理智上承受，但很少作家能够从作品中赋以形象，最大的原因还是在于他们不会投身于这样斗争的实生活，而赵树理先生则不但投身于这样的斗争，而且是抱了向民众学习的诚心的。
    《李家庄的变迁》不但是表现解放区生活的一部成功的小说，并且也是“整风”以后文艺作品所达到的高度水准之一例证。这一部优秀的作品表示了“整风”运动对于一个文艺工作者在思想和技巧的修养上会有怎样深厚的影响。关于思想内容的，上面已经讲到一些，现在我们单来说一说这部书的技巧。用一句话来品评，就是已经做到了大众化。没有浮泛的堆砌，没有纤巧的雕琢，朴质而醇厚，是这部书技巧方面很值得称道的成功。这是走向民族形式的一个里程碑，解放区以外的作者们足资借镜。而赵树理先生的这种技巧的获得，我想也别无秘密，就因为他是生活在人民中，工作在人民中，而且是向人民学习，善于吸收人民的生动朴素而富于形象化的语言之精华罢了。
