Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Reports from various sources indicate a noteworthy development in the Vietnam War. Three and a half months after the French army initiated the war, the army of the Republic of Vietnam has launched defensive counter-attacks in several regions. In An Dinh, 80 kilometers northeast of Hanoi, and at the train station 18 kilometers southeast, the Viet Minh have launched local counter-offensives for days. The same is happening in the area west of Saigon in the south. The French colonial authorities in Vietnam are clearly facing significant difficulties. The Viet Minh have been greatly strengthened through the reorganization of troops and unified command. According to reports in Parisian newspapers, French Commissioner to Vietnam D'Argenlieu is rumored to be resigning, though this has not been confirmed. D'Argenlieu, a staunch advocate of a military solution, has been summoned back to France by French Prime Minister Ramadier to report.

　　越军局部反攻
    【新华社延安十二日电】综合各方讯：越南战事，近有一为各方注意之发展。此即越南共和国军队，于法军发动战争的三个半月后，已在若干地区，进行自卫反击。在河内东北八十公里之安定，及东南十八公里之车站，越军连日发动局部反攻，在南部西贡以西之地区亦然。越境法殖民地当局，显然已面临重重困难。越军已因整编部队，统一指挥，而大见增强。据巴黎各报载，法驻越专员达根留有将辞职之说，惟尚未证实。达氏为武力解决之坚决主张者，正为法总理拉马第电召返法报告。
