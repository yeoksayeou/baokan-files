    Perhaps the best symbol of the Soviet Union's strength today is the new Five-Year Plan. In factories, on collective farms, in dormitories, and in clubs, the Five-Year Plan is being discussed by experts and ordinary people, soldiers and sailors. The grand prospects and heroic posture of this plan have inspired the enthusiasm of young people; for them, this is a continuation of the intense war, and the names of Stalingrad and Magnitogorsk (meaning the city of steel and the city of electricity) signify new miracles on a new page in Soviet history. Even foreign journalists from somewhat hostile camps, recalling past experiences, are very cautious in their predictions; they at least praise the Soviet Union's determination to succeed and dare not make light of their doubts. Emile Magnus, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, also commented in the conservative "World Knowledge" on August 10th of last year: "People are talking about miracles. Miracles are the working capacity of this socialist country."

    I don't believe in those supernatural explanations. Soviet churches are open, and people often go these days, but Soviet politics and economics are not based on monstrous miracles. Other European countries have also experimented with similar plans, but they have only achieved limited results. The difference lies in the realistic view of the Five-Year Plan. The basic characteristic of the Soviet plan has often been healthy empiricism. Its starting point is the recognition of the strength shown by Soviet industry since the war.

    Stalin did not ignore the lessons learned from the war: it is necessary to increase the speed and scope of Soviet industrialization to ensure the economic independence of the country during international crises. According to his statement, only when the production of iron, steel, and coal quadruples the pre-war output, and the production of oil reaches twice that, will the Soviet Union have enough strength to cope with any unexpected events. This will take many years, perhaps even two five-year plans. But even if the current plan is assumed not to be fully completed—although most serious observers are convinced that it will be—it will still prove what I previously judged: the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day.

    In the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, the significance of ensuring national security and defending the country against any future attacks is as obvious as its foreign policy. But it would be a mistake to interpret this plan as not making military preparations. Even if genuine universal disarmament becomes a reality tomorrow, the Soviet Union will still have a five-year plan, although the goals will still be equally ambitious, and the focus will naturally be different.

    If the current troubled world—which has ended the war but has not yet achieved peace—forces the Soviet Union to put the production of iron, steel, and coal ahead of the production of consumer goods, then a large portion of the wealth is still used to build a country where people's lives are full of joy and excitement. Along with the billions of rubles allocated to heavy industry, huge funds have been allocated to build new cities, parks, workers' residences, theaters, cinemas, libraries, and schools.

    The five main headings in the report by Voznesenski, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, provide a good explanation of this:

    "1. Increase industrial production by more than 50 percent above pre-war levels.

    2. Restore agriculture and consumer goods industries to ensure the material well-being of the Soviet people.

    3. Ensure technological progress in all sectors of the national economy, providing a strong impetus for increased production.

    4. Ensure the rapid accumulation of socialist capital, with 25 billion rubles mainly used for the reconstruction and development of the national economy.

    5. Further strengthen the defense force, and equip the army with the most modern weapons."

    In the ravaged areas, the Five-Year Plan has already begun to show its prospects. When the Germans swept through Belarus, they specifically destroyed every factory and enterprise building, leaving only striking rubble. The number of destroyed farmhouses exceeded 350,000. The entire region has been reduced to the level of 1913. The German occupation authorities themselves estimated that it would take at least ten years to rebuild Belarus. But today it has been confirmed that it will be completed within this five-year plan. In the winter of 1945, industrial production had doubled compared to the spring. But in other parts of the Soviet Union, even in the ravaged areas, the Five-Year Plan is not limited to reconstruction, it requires new construction on a larger scale than before the war. Since the start of the plan, the achievements of the electrical industry have shown that by 1950, Belarus's electricity production will be twice that of 1940.

    A building frenzy first started in the ravaged areas and then spread to all regions. The local authorities in cities such as Leningrad are troubled by requests for housing—a family of five can legitimately request a house. Moscow has in fact been occupied by people from other regions who were made homeless by the war. The disaster caused by Germany's world-destroying policy has led the Soviet Union to allocate 4.23 billion rubles to housing construction.

    In the reconstruction of Belarus, designers are trying to use local raw materials to keep prices as low as possible and to prevent transportation agencies from being overburdened. Since many vehicles were destroyed during the war, the problem of providing the Soviet Union with an effective transportation agency—a problem that almost drove the best administrators of the past five-year plans crazy—has been raised to an extremely important position. The current plan not only wants to restore pre-war effectiveness, but also greatly increase the production of locomotives and skins: 7,585 locomotives—the Second Five-Year Plan produced 5,960; 472,000 wagons—the previous record was 255,000. In addition to repairing the destroyed railway lines, the Soviet Union will build another 7,880 kilometers of rails; not only will the trunk lines like Donbas-Kryvyi Rih be repaired, but a strong industrial center will be established that will link the Soviet Union's great arsenal, the Urals, and push these routes across Siberia. The Five-Year Plan allocates 4.01 billion rubles for this.

    While developing railways, the development of the automotive industry is also starting; under the Five-Year Plan, 500,000 new cars (428,000 trucks, 65,000 passenger cars, 6,500 buses) will reach the market. The Soviets are unusually proud of their latest passenger car models, especially the streamlined Zie-11 produced by the Moscow Automobile Factory and the Pobcdn car produced by the Gorky Factory.

    While the Five-Year Plan in the ravaged areas such as Belarus is amazingly carrying out construction and reconstruction at the same time, the efforts of the areas not affected by the war to build a strong and prosperous Soviet Union are also showing its most moving scene.

    The Ural Mountains are one of the richest mountains in the world, and the diversity of its mineral resources allows the Soviets to refine unusually hard steel. Italian Ambassador to Moscow, Quaroni, told me: "Now the Soviet Union's industrial wealth is stored and not even a tenth of it has been developed."

    Since the war, the furnaces of Magnitogorsk have poured a torrent of steel for Soviet guns; today they are producing for the reconstruction of the country. By 1950, Magnitogorsk alone will produce 70 percent more pig iron, 110 percent more steel, and auxiliary materials than in 1940. The entire Urals will produce two and a half times more pig iron than in 1940; coal and oil production will each increase by 2.7 times and 3.2 times compared to pre-war levels. Under the Five-Year Plan, through the construction of the Gau River Hydropower Station near Moscow and eight hydropower stations along the Ufa River, the Urals will achieve self-sufficiency in electricity. The construction of new metalworker residences is underway. It took 40 days to build each residence in the winter of 1945, and this spring (1946) it only takes 27 days.

    In addition to Magnitogorsk, new steel mills are being established in Nizhny Tagil and Chelyabinsk, and at the same time, one in Orsk-Khalilov will soon begin manufacturing a new metal containing a high percentage of chromium and nickel. The Urals' Five-Year Plan also provides for the highest degree of application of the Ural-Bakchar aluminum plant. To make all this possible, forty-one new coal mines will be developed in the next five years.

    Belarus and the Urals only illustrate the implementation of the Five-Year Plan in typical ravaged and non-ravaged areas. The same construction is also taking place in the vast Soviet territory. A number reveals the width of this industrial effort. The total amount of industrial production in the last year of the Five-Year Plan will reach 20.5 billion rubles (based on 1926-27 prices), in other words, an increase of 48 percent compared to pre-war figures.

    Although production is mainly concentrated in heavy industry, a large amount of preparation has also been made for the production of consumer goods. The textile industry is expected to produce 4.5 million meters of cotton cloth, 150 million meters of woolen fabric, 14.1 million meters of silk, 240 million pairs of shoes, and 58 million pairs of socks. As agriculture has been pushed to the highest limit, Soviet administrators are extremely hopeful that the food industry can increase by 17 percent each year. At first, it was thought that the food rationing system could be abolished this year, but based on this year's harvest situation, the Council of Ministers decided to continue it until 1947.

    Nevertheless, the figures for consumer goods output are not very meaningful, because the Soviet plan makes large purchases through trade agreements with neighboring countries to increase its own production. When I was in Moscow, a delegation from Prague led by Gottwald and Masaryk was signing an agreement that would allow the Soviet Union to obtain many products from the Czech light industry. These agreements are not beneficial to the Soviet Union. In Stockholm, I found that the Swedish Social Democratic government, which was impartial to the Bolsheviks, was also very satisfied with its new agreement, which greatly expanded Swedish machinery and consumer goods enterprises. The situation in Switzerland is exactly the same.

    In the cultural field, the Soviet plan seems to be endless. I heard leading cadres say: When the Five-Year Plan's mass education plan is completed, the Soviet people will become the most educated people in the world. I arrived in Moscow after the end of the school semester, and 550,000 students and 50,000 scientific workers had obtained degrees. When the Five-Year Plan is halfway through, 120,000 to 130,000 experts will graduate from universities and specialized schools.

    The Soviet Union has just emerged from a war for survival, which ended with the Red Army's victory entering Berlin. Now it is facing another arduous test—the battle to rebuild the Soviet Union. The Soviet people are still fighting this battle with the same confidence in final victory. Many unexpected events will occur during the course of the Five-Year Plan; we will often see leadership changes, job changes, or mass dismissals, as is happening now in Ukraine, which may make people think that the Soviet Union is on the verge of internal collapse. In fact, in many cases, these messages only illustrate that the principle of "equipping the right people for certain positions" is being resolutely implemented. According to human nature, we may inevitably think of industrial exploitation and corruption. But in the Soviet Union, these are very dangerous practices, not only because the socialist country is very serious about these issues, but also because a latent change in people's morality is opposing anyone from profiting from public efforts. One day on the Moscow subway, I was sitting next to a young soldier. We spoke in Spanish, and when he found out I was from America, his first question was: "Is it true that war profiteering is allowed in America?" He could understand peacetime profiteering, but creating private happiness from the war trade when soldiers were bleeding and sacrificing on the front lines seemed inconceivable to him.

    In any case, people should not overestimate the difficulties that the Soviet Union may encounter in implementing the Five-Year Plan—Hitler made this mistake when estimating the Soviet Union's domestic development from 1937 to 1941—which cost him Germany. It is not as difficult for the Soviet people to accept the Five-Year Plan as people in countries where the working class has not yet come to power imagine. It is ridiculous to deny certain coercive elements in the implementation of planned economies, especially when the demands on the people are so extraordinarily large. But it is equally foolish to fail to see the difference in the working attitude of workers in a socialist country and workers in a free enterprise country. As early as 1918, Lenin determined that socialist competition would play a decisive role in social reform. He said: "Capitalism produced productive forces that were completely incomprehensible in the era of serfdom. Capitalism can and will eventually be defeated, because socialism will produce greater productive forces."

    This is the basis that inspires the implementation of the Five-Year Plan. Those who forget the socialist factor will never understand the source of Soviet power.

    今天苏联力量的最好的标志也许便是新的五年计划。在工厂里，在集体农场上，在宿舍里，在俱乐部里，五年计划到处被专门家和普通人，士兵和水手们讨论着。这一计划的远大前程与雄姿，已经鼓舞了青年们的热情；对于他们，这是紧张的战争的继续，而斯大林格勒和马格涅托哥尔斯克城的名字（意即钢的城市和电的城市），就意味着在苏维埃历史新页上的新奇迹。即使是从多少带有敌意的阵营来的外国记者，忆起以前的经验，在他们的预言中也是很谨慎的；他们至少都赞许苏联对成功的决心，而不敢轻于作怀疑的评论。最近才从苏联回来的爱密尔·马格纳斯（EMILE MAGNUS）在保守的去年八月十日的世界知识上也评论说：“人们都议论奇迹。奇迹乃是这个社会主义国家的工作能力。”
    我不相信那些超自然的解释。苏联的教堂是开放着的，而且这些日子常有人去，但是苏联的政治和经济却都不是基于神怪的奇迹。欧洲其他国家也曾试验过类似的计划，但都只获得有限的成绩。他们的区别，乃在于五年计划的现实观点。苏维埃计划的基本特点曾经常是健康的经验主义。它的出发点是对于战争以来苏联工业所显示的力量的认识。
    斯大林并未忽视从战争取得教训：必须提高苏联工业化的速度和范围，以保证在国际危机时期国家经济的独立。根据他的声明，只有当铁钢和煤的生产四倍于战前的产额，以及油的生产达到两倍时，苏联才有足够的力量应付任何意外事变。这将须要好多年，也许还得两个五年计划。但现在的计划即使假定不能全部完成——虽然多数严正的观察家都深信它将完成——也仍会证明我以前所判断的：苏联正在日益壮大。
    苏联五年计划中，保障国家的安全、防卫国家抵御将来任何袭击的意义，正和它的外交政策一样明显。但如把这一计划解释为不作军事准备，则将是一个错误。就算明天真正的普遍裁军成为事实，苏联仍将有一个五年计划，虽然目标还是同样远大，而重点则当然不同。
    如果说目前纷扰的世界——它曾结束了战争但至今尚未取得和平——迫使苏联不得不把铁钢和煤的生产放在消费品生产的前面，那末，也仍有一大部分资财是用来建设一个人民生活充满着愉快和兴奋的国家的。与亿万卢布被分配到重工业一起，拨出了巨大的经费以建设新的城市、公园、工人住宅、剧院、电影院、图书馆和学校。
    国家设计委员会主席佛茨纳逊斯基（VOZNESENSKI）所提的报告中的五个主要的标题，对此作了很好的说明：
    “一、增加工业生产超过战前水平百分之五十。
    二、恢复农业和消费品工业以保证苏维埃人民的物质幸福。
    三、保证在国民经济一切部门中的技艺上的进步，为增加了的生产供给强大的动力。
    四、保证社会主义资本的迅速积累，以二百五十亿卢布主要用作重建和发展国民经济的投资。
    五、进一步增强自卫力量，军队要以最现代化的武器装备起来。”
    在被蹂躏地区，五年计划已开始显示了它的远景。当德国人扫荡过白俄罗斯时，他们还特别破坏了每个工厂和企业建筑只留下触目的瓦砾堆。被毁农舍的数目超过三十五万座。全区已降低到一九一三年的水平。德国占领当局自己曾估计，重建白俄罗斯最低限度须要十年。但今天已经肯定，它将在这一个五年计划内完成。一九四五年冬季，工业生产即已提高到春季的两倍。但在苏联的其他部分，即使是被蹂躏地区，五年计划也不限于重建，它要求在比战前更大的范围上，作新的建设。自从计划开始以来，电气工业的成就，已显示出到一九五○年时，白俄罗斯的电力生产将达一九四○年的两倍。
    一种建筑的热狂首先开始在被蹂躏地区，继而就传布到所有区域。城市的地方当局如列宁格勒就为要求住所的申请所窘困——五口之家就可以正当的要求一间房子。莫斯科事实上已被由于战争而无家可归的其他地区的人民所占据。德国的毁灭世界的政策所造成的灾难，使苏联拨出四二．三亿卢布以从事于房屋的建设。
    在重建白俄罗斯中，设计者企图利用当地的原料以保持价格尽可能低廉，并使运输机构不致过分辛劳。由于许多车辆在战争中被毁坏，供给苏联以效能卓著的运输机构的问题——一个使过去五年计划的最好的行政干部几乎疯狂的问题——已经提到了极其重要的地位。目前的计划不仅要恢复战前的效能，而且要大大增加火车头和皮的生产：七，五八五个火车头——第二次五年计划生产的为五，九六○个；四七二，○○○辆货车——以前的纪录是二五五，○○○。除修理被破坏的铁路线外，苏联将再建筑七·八八○公里的铁轨；不仅要修复像顿巴斯——克利渥埃罗格那样的干线，同时将缔结苏联伟大的兵工厂乌拉尔的强有力的工业中心，并把这些路线推进到横越西伯利亚。五年计划为此分拨了四○·一亿卢布。
    与发展铁路同时，汽车工业的发展也在开始进行；在五年计划之下，五○○，○○○辆新汽车（四二八，○○○辆卡车，六五，○○○辆客车，六，五○○辆公共汽车）将到达市场。苏联人异常骄傲于他们的最新的客车模型，特别是莫斯科汽车工厂出品的流线型的Zie—11和高尔基工厂出品的胜利牌（Pobcdn）汽车。
    当白俄罗斯等被蹂躏地区五年计划正在令人惊叹地同时进行建设和重建的时候，战争未波及地区为建设一个强大的繁盛的苏联的努力，也表现了他的最动人的一幕。
    乌拉尔山脉是世界上最富的山脉之一，而其矿产资源的多样性，使得苏联人能够精练出异常坚硬的钢。意大利驻莫斯科大使库罗涅（M Quaroui）曾告诉我：“现在苏联的工业富藏甚至尚未开发出十分之一来。”
    战争以来，马格涅托哥尔斯克的熔炉曾为苏联的枪炮倾泻出一支钢铁的洪流；今天他们却正为重建国家而生产。到一九五○年时，仅只马格涅托哥尔斯克将生产出较一九四○年增加百分之七十的铸铁，百分之一百一十的钢和补助物品。整个乌拉尔则将生产较一九四○年增加二倍半的铸铁；煤和石油的产额将各较战前水平提高二·七倍和三·二倍。在五年计划之下，经过莫斯科城附近加乌河水电站，和沿乌发河的八个水电站的建设，乌拉尔的电力将达到自给自足。新的金属工人住宅的建设正在建筑中，各个住宅在一九四五年冬要四十天才建筑起来，而今年（一九四六年）春天则只要二十七天。
    除马格涅托哥尔斯克外，在涅滋涅——太吉尔和乞利亚宾斯克，新的炼钢厂正在建立起来，而同时在俄斯克——克哈立洛夫的一个，很快即将开始制造一种新的含有很高的百分比的铬和镍的金属。乌拉尔的五年计划也提供了对乌拉尔——巴乞洛的制铝厂的最高度的应用。为使这一切可能，在今后五年中，四十一个新的煤矿将要开发出来。
    白俄罗斯和乌拉尔只是说明了五年计划在典型的被蹂躏区和未蹂躏区的实施。在广大的苏维埃领土上也在进行着同样的建设。一个数目字就透露了这一工业努力的宽度。五年计划最后一年工业生产的总量将达二○五亿卢布（根据一九二六——二七年的价格），换言之，即较战前数目字增加百分之四十八。
    虽然生产最主要的集中于重工业方面，但消费品的生产也作了大量准备。纺织业预期将生产棉布四百五十万公尺，毛织品一万五千万公尺，绸一万四千一百万公尺，鞋二万四千万双，长袜短袜五万八千万双。由于农业已推进到最高限度，苏维埃行政干部极希望在食品工业上能每年提高百分之十七。起先，曾以为今年食粮配给制度能够取销，但根据今年的收获情形，部长会议决定继续到一九四七年。
    虽然如此，消费品产额的数目字是没有很大意义的，因为苏联计划经过和邻近国家的贸易协定，作大量的购买，以增加自己的生产。当我在莫斯科时，从布拉格来的由哥德瓦尔（Goffwald）和马沙力克（Mqanryk）所领导的代表团正在一个协定上签字，这一协定将使苏联得到捷克轻工业的许多产品。这些协定并不是对苏联有利。在斯托哥尔姆，我发现毫不偏袒布尔塞维克的瑞典社会党政府，也很满意于它的新协定，这一协定大大扩展了瑞典的机器和消费品的企业。瑞士的情形也完全一样。
    在文化领域内，苏维埃计划似乎是无止境的。我听到领导干部说：当五年计划的群众教育计划完成时，苏联人民将成为世界上最有教养的人民。我到莫斯科正在学校学期结束以后，五五○，○○○学生和五○·○○科学工作者正取得了学位。当五年计划进行到一半时，十二万至十三万专家就将从大学和专门学校毕业。
    苏联才正从一个求生存的战争中脱身出来，这一战争以红军的胜利进入柏林而结束。现在它又面对着一个艰苦的考验——重建苏联的战斗。苏联人民仍抱着同样的最后胜利的信心来进行这一战斗。许多意外事变将在五年计划的进程中发生；我们将时常看到领导的更替，职务的变动或是大批的免职，如现在乌克兰发生的一样，这可能使人以为苏联是处在一个内部破裂的边缘上。事实上，许多情形下，这些消息只是说明：“配备适当的人到一定的岗位上去”的原则正被坚决地执行着。根据人类的本性，也许我们必然会推想到工业上的欺榨和贪污腐化。但在苏联，这些是很危险的作法，这不仅因为社会主义国家对这些问题非常严正，而且因为在人民道德上一种潜伏的变革在反对着任何一个人从公共的努力中营取私利。有一天在莫斯科的地下电车里，我坐在一个青年士兵的旁边。我们用西班牙文谈起话来，而当他发现我是从美国来的，他的第一个问题就是：“在美国允许发战争财，这是不是事实？”他能懂得和平时期的营利，但当士兵们在前线流血牺牲的时候，从战争的买卖里来创造私人的幸福，这对于他却似乎是不可思议的。
    无论如何，人们不应过高估计苏联在实现五年计划时可能遇到的困难—希特勒在估计苏联从一九三七年到一九四一年国内发展时犯了这个错误——这便使他赔出了德国。使苏联人民接受五年计划，并不像那些工人阶级尚未当权的国度的人们所想像的那样困难。否认在计划经济实施中一定的强制成分，特别是当着对人民的要求是这样异常宏大时候，这简直是可笑的。但如看不出一个社会主义国家的工人和一个自由企业国家工人的工作态度的区别，这也是同样的愚蠢。远在一九一八年，列宁即曾断定社会主义竞赛将在社会的改革中起决定的作用。他说：“资本主义产生了在农奴时代所完全不能理解的生产力。资本主义能够而且将最后被战败，因为社会主义将产生更伟大的生产力。”
    这就是鼓舞着五年计划实现的根据。那些忘了社会主义的因素的人们将永远不能理解苏联力量的源泉。
