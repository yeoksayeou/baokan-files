    [Report from the Jiluyu Front, February 17th] When the People's Liberation Army recovered Suixian County on the 9th, over a hundred remnant enemy troops from the local security regiment desperately broke through the siege. After reaching Longtanggang (east of Minquan), they were surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. The battle lasted 30 minutes, resulting in the complete annihilation of the enemy force. On the 11th, the People's Liberation Army marched north, further annihilating a portion of the Kuomintang's 72nd Division north of Heshangmiao Longtanggang, killing or wounding over 50 enemy soldiers and capturing over 20.
    [Report from the Jiluyu Front, February 17th] (Delayed) The Yuwansu People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Boxian County in northwest Anhui on the 13th and is currently engaged in combat with Kuomintang troops in the suburbs. The Kuomintang's 48th Division, with over 2,000 troops stationed in Guoyang, and the Yongcheng security regiment, with over 1,000 troops, launched an attack on Boxian County from Guoyang and Yongcheng along multiple routes on the 12th, under the cover of aircraft and artillery. Each advance was met with strong resistance from the People's Liberation Army and local people's armed forces. After completing the task of weakening the enemy, the People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from the city on the 13th and is now conducting mobile warfare with the enemy in the suburbs.
