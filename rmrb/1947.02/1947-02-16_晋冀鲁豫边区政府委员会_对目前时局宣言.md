　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Committee
    Declaration on the Current Situation
    Since the victory of the counter-offensive, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, have colluded with American imperialists, selling out sovereignty, and recklessly pursuing a dictatorial and civil war policy, harming the country and the people, and their crimes are obvious. The facts of the past year have proven that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to eliminate the Liberated Areas as their consistent conspiracy; negotiations for peace were originally a deception. With the help of the American reactionaries, they soon went back on their word, tore up the truce order, invaded the Liberated Areas, and suppressed the people's peaceful and democratic movement, and this has become even more intense! Recently, they have followed the example of Yuan Shikai and Cao Cao, disregarding the opposition of the people of the whole country, and arbitrarily convened the pseudo-National Assembly, usurping the name of "People's Representatives," and formulating a pseudo-constitution, attempting to whitewash democracy, deceive the world, and consolidate their one-party dictatorial rule. Those who steal the country will inevitably sell it out, and aggressors must have internal collaborators. The only difference between now and the past is that the traitors and aggressors are even more cunning! In the past year, the American imperialists' aggression against China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland have been unprecedented in their madness and viciousness! The "Chiang-American Commercial Treaty" of November 4 last year is even a hundred times more humiliating and detrimental to the country than the "Twenty-One Demands" of the fourth year of the Republic of China.
    The people's century will never allow such brutal people to do whatever they want. The nation that fought bloody battles for eight years of resistance against Japan has profound strength, and the people are determined not to be slaves and be trampled upon by others. We are convinced that the torrent of the victorious self-defense war in the Liberated Areas and the great peaceful and democratic movement in the Chiang-controlled areas will surely drown the fierce and stubborn butchers!
    The plenary session of our government committee, representing the will of the people of the entire region, solemnly declares: We swear to oppose the joint offensive of Chiang and the United States! Resolutely oppose the Kuomintang's pseudo-constitution that tramples on the people's freedom! Sincerely support the solemn statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on February 1, and do not recognize any treaties that the Chiang government has signed with foreign countries since January 10 of last year that are detrimental to our sovereignty and humiliating to our country, and do not bear any obligations. According to the demands of the people of the entire region, we designate November 4, the day the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty was signed, as National Humiliation Memorial Day, to serve as a warning!
    We swear to implement the above points with all our strength, and will never stop until our goal is achieved. We hope that all the elders and fellow countrymen across the country will rise up together and fight to the end for a new China of independence, peace, and democracy!
    Long live the victory of the patriotic self-defense war!
    Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!
    Long live the new China of independence, peace, and democracy!
              February 12, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China

　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府委员会
    对目前时局宣言
    自反攻胜利以后，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，勾结美帝国主义者，出卖主权，肆行独裁内战政策，祸国殃民，罪恶彰著。一年来的事实证明：国民党反动派决心消灭解放区为其一贯阴谋；谈判和平，原为欺骗。在美国反动派帮助之下，旋即自食诺言，撕毁停战令，进犯解放区，镇压人民和平民主运动，至今愈演愈烈！近复师法袁曹，不顾全国人民之反对，擅自召开伪国民大会，篡窃“人民代表”名义，制定伪宪法，企图粉饰民主，欺骗世人，以巩固其一党独裁统治。窃国者必然卖国，侵略者必有内应，今昔所异者，卖国贼与侵略者交为狡黠而已。一年来，美国帝国主义者之对华侵略与蒋介石之出卖祖国，其疯狂毒辣，史未前有！去年十一月四日“蒋美商约”之丧权辱国，更百倍于民国四年之“二十一条”。
    人民世纪，绝不容此辈凶残者畅所欲为。八年浴血抗战之民族，具有深厚之力量，人民决不愿作奴隶，任人蹂躏。吾人确信：解放区的胜利自卫战争与蒋管区之伟大的和平民主运动之洪流，必将使凶顽屠夫灭顶！
    本府全体委员会议，代表全区人民意志郑重宣言：誓死反对蒋美之联合进攻！坚决反对蹂躏人民自由国民党伪宪法！竭诚拥护中共中央二月一日之庄严声明，不承认蒋政府自去年一月十日以来对外所订一切丧权辱国条约，并不负担任何义务，依据全区人民要求，定蒋美商约签订之十一月四日为国耻纪念日，以资惕励！
    上述各端，誓以全力贯彻，不达目的绝不休止。尚望全国父老同胞，一致兴起，为争取独立和平民主的新中国奋斗到底！
    爱国自卫战争胜利万岁！
    中华民族解放万岁！
    独立和平民主的新中国万岁！
              民国三十六年二月十二日
