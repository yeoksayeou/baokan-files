    Small circles are numerous, large circles are numerous, organizations are constantly being created with new tricks;
    Bureaucrats are numerous, mistresses are numerous, "government" agencies have many traitors;
    Commissioners are numerous, county heads are numerous, exiled empty-shell organizations are numerous;
    Beatings and scoldings are numerous, escapes are numerous, Japanese people are numerous in the army and factories;
    Drownings in wells are numerous, hangings are numerous, "Soldier-Farmer Unity" forces many to death;
    "Son Principles" are numerous, "Mother Principles" are numerous, fascist absurdities are numerous;
    Prostitutes are numerous, worn-out shoes are numerous, female waitresses are numerous in restaurants;
    Hooligans are numerous, local ruffians are numerous, petty thieves are even more numerous than rats;
    Trash is numerous, excrement is numerous, hidden and buried landlords fleeing are numerous;

    Note: (1) "Small circles" and "large circles" are Yan's special feudal secret agent organizations, like Tongzhi associations, which are large circles, and the Enemy Work Corps is one of the small circles, which contains even smaller circles.
    (2) "Son Principles" and "Mother Principles" are Yan Xishan's traitorous theories. For example, he says "seeking survival" (i.e., letting him be a local emperor forever, maintaining feudal rule and exploitation) is the "Mother Principle," which cannot be changed; "Resisting Japan" is the "Son Principle," which can be changed; in order to "seek survival," it doesn't matter to collude with the Japanese invaders and sell out the people to fight the Eighth Route Army.

    太原社会相
    伟建  林彬
    说这多，道那多，阎家丑事特别多；
    宪兵多，警察多，满天飞的特务多；
    监狱多，刑法多，半夜活埋的人儿多；
    小圈多，大圈多，花样翻新的组织多；
    官僚多，太太多，“政府”机关汉奸多；
    专员多，县长多，流亡的空头机关多；
    打骂多，逃跑多，军队、工厂里日本人多；
    投井多，上吊多，“兵农合一”逼死人多；
    “子理”多，“母理”多，法西斯怪论多；
    妓女多，破鞋多，女招待在饭馆里多；
    流氓多，地痞多，小偷还比老鼠多；
    垃圾多，大粪多，逃亡地主埋藏的多；
    料面多，大烟多，跪街乞讨的老头多；
    市场多，游资多，囤积居奇的官商多；
    口红多，脂粉多，美国货在商店里多；
    杂税多，苛捐多，市民出的款子多；
    酒肉多，宴席多，饥寒交迫的穷人多。
    穷人多，不能活，“老朽”的日子你有几多！？
    注：（１）“小圈”、“大圈”，是阎的特务封建组织，如同志会，为大圈，敌工团是其中的一个小圈，而小圈中又有小圈。
    （２）“子理”、“母理”是阎锡山的汉奸理论。如说“求生存”（即让他永远当土皇帝，保持封建统治剥削。）是“母理”，不可变；“抗日”是子理，可变；为了“求存生”，无妨与日寇勾结，出卖人民打八路军。
