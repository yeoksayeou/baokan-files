Border Region Federation of Trade Unions Calls for Vigorously Developing the Production Movement

[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, in commemoration of the "February 7th" Strike, issued a call to all workers in the Border Region to launch a great production movement. The full text is as follows:

This year's great "February 7th" anniversary of the Chinese working class falls on the eve of the patriotic self-defense war moving towards a counter-offensive and the upsurge of the national democratic movement. All workers in the Border Region will enter this upsurge with the same heroism and enthusiasm as during the counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders. The Federation hereby calls on all workers in the Border Region to launch a comprehensive transformation and improvement of the great production movement:

First, implement the policy of labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit for both public and private interests. In the production movement, comprehensively transform and improve our production, the masses, and leadership in accordance with the needs of production and the masses. Conscientiously achieve what Chairman Mao instructed: "Large quantity, good quality, low cost, sufficient raw materials, and wide sales" to develop production and support the front lines.

Second, factories and mines of different natures and foundations should actively participate in the movement according to their specific conditions. Whether staff or workers, leaders or the masses, all should formulate plans to improve themselves and improve production, launch a new heroic competition, strive to become labor heroes and model workers, and strive to become model factories. A campaign to perform meritorious service should also be launched in production, calling on every worker and staff member to make greater and more contributions to the people in the patriotic self-defense war.

Third, in order to make the movement a success, it is also necessary to implement the mass line, care for the lives of workers, organize workers' family production, and solve the difficulties and concerns in workers' lives, so that workers can wholeheartedly and concentrate their energy on production.

Fourth, in the production movement, the trade union should strive to mobilize workers to participate in the movement, adhere to regular education, strengthen worker unity, and enhance workers' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. It should also organize mass inspections, summaries, and technical research, and cultivate worker cadres.

Comrades, workers of the entire region! Heroically and enthusiastically participate in this movement, shoulder the arduous and glorious task given to us by history, to meet the arrival of the great democratic movement upsurge!
