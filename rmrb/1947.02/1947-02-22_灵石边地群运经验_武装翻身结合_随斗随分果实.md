　　【Taiyue, This Newspaper, 19th】In Lingshi, half of the villages are carrying out land reform in conjunction with guerrilla warfare. Villages like Shijia Gou have already overthrown the feudal forces and are now distributing the fruits of the struggle. In villages like Chenjiashan and Renyi, the movement has entered a climax. Villages like Wuhenggou have moved from secret醞釀 to open struggle. The County Federation has summarized the experiences of the past three months of struggle: First, expand the peasant struggle ranks: absorb all peasants who participated in the anti-traitor and liquidation campaigns, take care of and unite with middle peasants, distribute fruits of the struggle even to those who do not participate in the struggle, explain to landlords that fleeing is a crime but staying home will allow them to live, and hold a swearing-in ceremony before the struggle to resolutely fight the landlords to the end. Second, emancipation and defending emancipation are equally important. The beginning of mobilizing the masses is the beginning of armed self-defense. When the masses of Chenjiashan united to fight the landlords, they first demanded a solution to the armed issue, buying new guns, repairing old guns, and making stone mines, etc. The organizational structure of the farmers' association has also become combat-oriented. During the tense struggle period, farmers associations in villages like Renyi set up guard platoons, custody platoons and flexible groups, and the villages jointly defended the fruits of emancipation. Third, distribute the fruits of struggle as you fight, first distributing grain and clothing, then distributing housing and land. Fourth, extensively train peasant backbones as a bridge to carry out the movement. The first district convened a peasant self-emancipation and homeland defense meeting of more than 50 people, and after returning to the village, the struggle spread like wildfire. Fifth, disintegrate the landlords' counter-offensive conspiracy: concentrate forces to fight big despots and big landlords, cut down big trees and break through big bunkers to stabilize people's hearts.

　　灵石边地群运经验
    武装翻身结合
    随斗随分果实
    【本报太岳十九日电】灵石有二分之一村庄正进行着游击战争结合土地改革。师家沟等村已将封建势力打垮，正进行果实分配。陈家山、仁义等村，运动已进入高潮。坞横河等村已由秘密酝酿走向公开斗争。县联合会总结三个月来斗争经验：第一扩大农民斗争阵营：吸收所有参加反奸清算的农民参加，照顾和团结中农，不参加斗争的人亦分果实，向地主说明逃跑有罪恶，在家有生活，斗争前举行宣誓仪式与地主坚决斗争到底。第二翻身与保卫翻身同等重要，开始发动群众即是武装保家的开始，陈家山群众团结起来斗地的时候，首先要求解决武装问题，买新枪修旧枪造石雷等，农会组织机构亦战斗化了。仁义等村农会设立警戒股、保管股及灵活小组等，紧张的斗争时期，各村联防守卫翻身。第三、随斗随分果实，先分粮食衣物后分房产土地。第四、普遍的训练农民骨干，作为开展运动的桥梁，一区召开了五十余人的农民保家翻身会议，回村后如同星火燎原似的普遍的展开斗争。第五、分化地主反攻阴谋：集中力量斗争大恶霸大地主，砍倒大树攻破大碉堡，安定人心。
