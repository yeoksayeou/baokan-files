　　Taihang Administrative Office Directs All Regions to
    Rapidly Prepare for Spring Plowing
    Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Plans to Promote Agricultural Production
    [Report from our newspaper in Taihang on the 29th] The Taihang Administrative Office issued its first directive yesterday for launching this year's large-scale production campaign, ordering the entire region to rapidly prepare for spring plowing. 1. Rectify mutual aid and further develop organizations. In old areas, the focus will be on summarizing mutual aid experiences and resolving unresolved issues in combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and combining production with supporting labor and participating in the war. In new areas, the focus will be on educating peasants who have been emancipated on how to become prosperous through production, and organizing them by drawing on the experiences of the old areas. Border areas will focus on further developing the combination of labor and military affairs. 2. Resolve production difficulties, with particular attention to resolving the difficulties of newly emancipated farmers, retired soldiers, and refugees who have withdrawn from areas occupied by the Chiang army. 3. Specific preparations should immediately include checking whether farmers have sufficient fertilizer, fuel, and seeds, and in particular checking whether improved varieties have been damaged or are impure. If so, immediately find ways to remedy the situation. In addition to "Golden Queen Corn" and other varieties, attention should also be paid to promoting good varieties suitable for local conditions. Strengthen the training of technical personnel and establish technical research and guidance organizations at all levels. Help and mobilize the masses to formulate prosperity plans. 4. Check the use of agricultural loans. The directive emphasized: all regions should be vigilant against spontaneous trends and start immediately to complete the preparations as soon as possible. Under the principle that agriculture and sideline occupations are combined and sideline occupations do not affect agriculture, attention should be paid to timely shifting the focus of winter production to spring plowing. Avoid the phenomenon of not being able to shift in time last year in some areas, which affected spring plowing.
    [Report from our newspaper in Taihang on the 28th] In order to promote agricultural production, the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has formulated this year's work plan. The guideline is to go deep into the countryside to strengthen the promotion of improved varieties and technical guidance. The plan includes: 1. Improve the ability of extension workers and establish extension bases to facilitate the propagation of various improved varieties and create experience in breeding work. 2. Help various counties establish farms, village technical committees, and nurseries. 3. Assist several village cooperatives in managing agricultural production. 4. Organize tree planting on both sides of the highway. 5. Conduct several typical rural overview surveys and agricultural technology surveys; establish research groups to study the difficulties and requirements of farmers in cultivation after the mass movement, and other issues. The bureau's affiliated experimental farm will continue various variety trials to discover new improved varieties and propagate seeds such as "169 Wheat," "811 Millet," and "Golden Queen Corn." It will continue to experiment with the domestication of "Berkshire pigs" (British breed) and raising chickens and bees. The farm has also decided to enrich its equipment this year through self-reliance in production.

　　太行行署指示各地
    迅速进行春耕准备
    长治农林局计划推进农业生产
    【本报太行二十九日电】太行行署于昨日发出开展今年大生产运动的第一个指示，通令全区迅速进行春耕准备。一、整顿互助与进一步发展组织、老区以总结互助经验，解决农副业结合、生产与支差参战结合中未获解决的问题为主。新区对已翻身农民进行生产发家教育，吸取老区经验组织起来为主。边地则以进一步发展劳武结合为主。二、解决生产困难，尤须注意解决新翻身农户，荣退军人与从蒋军侵占区退出的难民的困难。三、具体准备应即检查农户肥料、燃料、种籽是否充足，特别是优良品种应检查是否损坏或不纯，否则立即设法补救。除“金皇后玉茭”等外还应注意推广适合本地的好品种。加强训练技术人材与建立各级技术研究指导的组织。帮助与发动群众订发家计划。四、检查农贷的运用。指示着重提出：各地应警惕自流现象，立即着手，早日完成。在农副结合与副业不影响农业的原则下，注意冬季生产适时变换重点，转向春耕。避免去年部分地区到时转不过来影响春耕的现象。
    【本报太行二十八日电】为推进农业生产，长治农林局订出今年工作计划。方针是深入农村加强优良品种推广与技术指导。计划包括：一、提高推广员能力，建立推广基点，以便于繁殖各种优良品种，创造育种工作经验。二、帮助各县建立农场，村技术委员会与苗圃。三、协助几个村合作社经营农业生产。四、组织公路两侧植树。五、进行几个典型的农村概况调查与农业技术调查；设研究组，研究群运后，农民在耕作上的困难与要求等问题。该局所属试验场将继续各种品种试验，发现新的优良品种与繁殖“一六九小麦”、“八一一谷”、“金皇后玉茭”等种籽。继续试验“巴克夏猪”（英国种）的驯化及养鸡养蜂等，该场今年并决以自力生产充实设备。
