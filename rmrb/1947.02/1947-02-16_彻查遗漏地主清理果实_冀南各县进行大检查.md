Thoroughly Investigate Omitted Landlords and Clean Up the Fruits of Land Reform
Jinnan Counties Conduct Major Inspections

[Our Newspaper Jinnan 14th Dispatch] In order to implement land reform, Jinnan is universally launching an inspection movement. The Puyang County Committee decided that the inspection should focus on: 1. Going deep into each village to help and urge the handling of all pending cases; 2. Inspecting the distribution of fruits, and helping to reasonably resolve any undistributed or unfairly distributed fruits. For village cadres who embezzle fruits or become detached from the masses, educate them to confess their mistakes to the masses and return the fruits. Deeply understand the production sentiment and difficulties of the masses at all levels, clarify the legitimate rights of farmers to obtain land, and quickly complete the burning of old deeds.

According to investigations in Houguo Village and Zaoyuan Village in the fourth district, the Ji County Committee found that the feudal exploitation of many landlords had not been eliminated, and they still maintained seven to thirteen mu per person. Therefore, it was decided to continue thorough investigation and reduction before Qingming Festival, calling on cadres to not be arrogant or complacent, thoroughly defeat feudal forces, and complete land reform. 1. Conduct a general inspection to see if there are any landlords who have been omitted or not thoroughly eliminated. If any are found, thoroughly eliminate them to allow the masses to completely liberate themselves. 2. Strengthen democratic education and strengthen the relationship between village cadres and the masses. 3. Rapidly distribute land and fruits, and complete tax deed work before Qingming Festival. The Wuxun County Party Committee instructed each district: 1. In villages where fruits have not been cleared, guarantee that village cadres will return excess fruits to the masses. 2. Fruits from struggle should not be used for other expenses (such as buying guns, or being kept as cooperative funds, etc.). Resolutely return fruits from struggle that were cheaply bought by cadres. 3. Clear out omitted landlords. 4. Deepen education, foster and rectify the organization, and adjust the composition of cadres, so that poor peasants form the leading backbone. The En County Party Committee, based on the three different types of regions in the county, instructed: 1. In villages where the masses have been more thoroughly mobilized, clear the remnants of fruits, measure land, establish documents, appropriately compensate for the losses of middle peasants, conduct ideological education, and conduct education on getting rich, breaking the thought of not wanting to advance. 2. In villages where the masses have not been thoroughly mobilized, organize forces to continue mobilizing; in "fake struggle" villages, reorganize the masses to speak out about their suffering and settle accounts. 3. In border villages, coordinate armed struggle with land reform. The county will uniformly organize work teams in the third, sixth, and fifth districts to carry out work.

　　彻查遗漏地主清理果实
    冀南各县进行大检查
    【本报冀南十四日电】为贯彻土地改革冀南普遍开展检查运动。濮县县委会决定检查重点：一、深入各村，帮助和督促处理一切悬案；二、检查果实分配情形，发现未分或分得不合理的要帮助合理解决。对贪污果实或脱离群众的村干，教育他们向群众坦白认错并退出果实。深入了解各阶层群众的生产情绪与困难，明确农民得到土地的合法权利，迅速完成焚掉旧契。
    冀县县委会根据四区后郭村、枣园等村的调查，发现不少地主封建剥削未消灭，仍保持每人七亩至十三亩，因之决定在清明节前，继续彻底查减，号召干部不骄不怠，彻底打垮封建势力，完成土地改革。一、普遍检查是否有遗漏及消灭不彻底的地主，发现后彻底予以消灭使群众翻透身。二、加强民主教育密切村干与群众关系。三、迅速分配土地与果实、清明前要完成税契工作。武训县委指示各区：一，凡未清理果实村庄保证村干部多得果实退给群众。二、斗争果实不作其他开支（如买枪、留作合作社基金等）干部贱买的斗争果实坚决退回。三、清算遗漏地主。四、深入教育中酝酿整理组织调整干部成份，贫农要形成领导骨干。恩县县委根据本县三种不同地区指示：一、群众发动较彻底村，清理果实尾巴，丈量土地立文书适当弥补中农损失，进行思想教育，进行发家教育，打破不愿上升思想。二、群众发动不彻底的村，组织力量继续发动，“假斗争”村，要重新组织群众诉苦清算。三、边沿村以武装斗争配合土地改革，三、六、五区由县统一组织工作队，开展工作。
