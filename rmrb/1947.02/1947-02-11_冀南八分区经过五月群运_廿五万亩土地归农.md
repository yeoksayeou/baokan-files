    [This newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 8th] After five months of the land reform movement, over a thousand villages in the Jinnan Eighth Sub-district, including all of Qinghe, Wucheng, Enxian, Gucheng, and Xiajin, and parts of Gaotang and Pingyuan, have basically completed land reform. Approximately 25% of impoverished farmers have had their holdings supplemented to an average of two to three mu per person. The poorest farmers have received an average of more than one mu of additional land per person. In the entire sub-district, approximately 250,000 impoverished farmers have been allocated over 250,000 mu of land. More than 80% of farmers have received substantial amounts of movable property. For example, farmers in Wucheng obtained over 38,000 mu of land and 22,700,000 yuan. After land reform, the feudal exploitation by landlords has been essentially completely eliminated, with only a few elderly, weak, orphaned, or widowed landlords remaining. For example, in 123 villages in Xiajin, out of 288 landlord households, only seven elderly, weak, orphaned, or widowed households remained. In the sixth district of Enxian, out of 45 villages, only one elderly landlord remained. Wealthy peasants with feudal vestiges have also been weakened to some extent, generally reduced by more than 50%. The proportion of middle peasants has increased from 40% to 60% before the mass movement to 65% to over 90%. Each person has an average of four mu of land. Most of the poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants or poor-middle peasants. The existing poor peasants only account for 2% to 10% of the total rural households. In the sixth district of Enxian, the proportion of poor peasants has decreased from 28% before the mass movement to 6.3%. Ordinary poor people own over 22% of the total rural land, with each person generally supplemented to two to three and a half mu. Some villages have no poor peasants at all. Extreme poverty has been basically completely eliminated after the mass movement, with most rising to become middle peasants or poor peasants. Only a very small proportion remains in the poorest villages. For example, in Xiajin, out of 88 villages with 661 households, only 30 are still extremely poor. However, from a political perspective, the masses in some villages have not yet been truly mobilized. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out in-depth consolidation work, adjust the relationship between activists and the masses, and investigate overlooked landlords.

    [This newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 8th] After two months of mass movement, the Second District of Qi’s County has completely eliminated feudal rule and exploitation, realizing the principle of “land to the tiller.” In the entire district, 47 villages eliminated 103 feudal despotic landlords and weakened 180 despotic wealthy peasants, recovering over 7,000 mu of land, over 1,400 rooms, 231 homesteads, 70 head of cattle, and three mules. The land of all poor peasants in the district has been leveled up, and middle peasants have also benefited. For example, 40 poor peasant households in Luzhai have had their holdings leveled up by 2.7 mu per person, with a maximum of four mu. The elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed received five to eight mu. Middle peasants have 4.3 mu of land per person, with a maximum of six mu. Mass organizations have developed unprecedentedly. Membership in the Peasants' Association has increased from 3,254 to 3,956, the Women's National Salvation Association from 1,900 to 2,087, and the militia from 500 to 585. Sister squads and children's corps have also increased. Organized masses total over 10,000, truly organizing 90% of the masses.

    冀南八分区经过五月群运
    廿五万亩土地归农
    【本报威县八日电】经过五个月的翻身运动，冀南八分区清（河）、武（城）、恩（县）、故（城）、夏（津）全部和高（唐）、平（原）部分地区千余村，基本完成土地改革，百分之二十五左右的穷苦农民，每人平均补齐到二亩至三亩，赤贫农每人平均增加一亩多地，全分区二十五万左右的贫农分得到土地二十五万亩以上，百分之八十以上的农民分到大量浮财，如武城农民就获得了三万八千余亩地，二十二万万七千余万元。经过土地改革后，地主的封建剥削基本上完全消灭了，只留下个别老弱孤寡地主，如夏津一百二十三个村二百八十八户地主，只留下七家老弱孤寡；恩县六区四十五村，只留下一家老太太地主。带封建尾巴的富农也被削弱一部分，一般的减少百分之五十以上，中农则由群运前占总户数百分之四十到百分之六十上升到百分之六十五到百分之九十以上。每人平均有土地四亩。贫农大部上升为中农或贫中农，现存贫农只占农村总户数的百分之二到百分之十。恩县六区贫农由群运前之百分之二十八降为百分之六·三，一般贫民占有农村土地总数的百分之二十二以上，每人土地一般补齐到二亩到三亩半，有些村庄根本没有贫农了。赤贫在群运后基本上完全消灭，大部上升为中农、贫农，只有在最贫的村庄还有极小一部分，如夏津八十八个村六百六十一家，赤贫还有三十家。但从政治上看，仍有一部分村子，群众还没有真正发动起来，因此，还需要进行深入巩固工作，调整积极分子与群众的关系，清查遗漏的地主。
    【本报威县八日电】企之二区经两月的群运，彻底消灭了封建统治与剥削，实现耕者有其田。全区四十七个村，共消灭了封建恶霸地主一百零三户，削弱恶霸富农一百八十户，追回土地七千余亩。房屋一千四百余间、庄基二百三十一座、牛七十头、骡三匹。全区贫农土地都填平了，中农亦得到利益，如鲁寨贫农四十户，每人填平二亩七分，最多达四亩，老弱孤寡五亩至八亩。中农每人有地四亩三分，最多者六亩。群众组织空前发展，农会员由三千二百五十四人增到三千九百五十六人，妇救会由一千九百人增加到二千零八十七人，民兵由五百人增加到五百八十五人，姊妹团、儿童团都增多，有组织群众共一万余，真正组织了百分之九十的群众。
