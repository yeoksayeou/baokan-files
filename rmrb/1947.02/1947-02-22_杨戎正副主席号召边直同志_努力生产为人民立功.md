　　Yang Rong and Vice Chairman Call on Border Area and Directly Subordinate Comrades
    to Work Hard in Production and Render Meritorious Service to the People

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Border Region Government and all staff members of directly subordinate organizations held a meeting on the morning of the 18th, where Chairman Yang Rong, Vice Chairman, and Secretary-General Sun spoke to mobilize everyone to render meritorious service to the people and launch a production movement in the organs. Chairman Yang said: The meritorious service movement of the troops has been carried out very vigorously, but we are still lagging behind. To launch a meritorious service movement, we must overcome complacency, the "good enough" mentality, and the indifference of "an old ox pulling a cart," neither pushing nor pulling. Chairman Yang called on everyone to get rid of all kinds of burdens, be down-to-earth, and render meritorious service to the people. He also urged everyone to particularly overcome the idea that there is no opportunity to render meritorious service while working in the organs. Chairman Yang said: This year is a year of great production, and this is an opportunity to render meritorious service. Every comrade should strive to become a model production worker and learn how to do financial and economic work. Vice Chairman Rong briefly explained the financial situation of the Border Region, stating: Now, due to the Chiang Kai-shek army's offensive, expenses have increased. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and fight for the people, we must work hard and arduously to welcome the light. Vice Chairman Rong recalled the glorious tradition of the Party, government, and army engaging in labor production during the years of famine in our region, working intensely and enthusiastically, practicing frugality, eating more than 150 kinds of wild vegetables, and the Party, government, army, and people uniting as one and sharing weal and woe with the masses. He then called on everyone to immediately mobilize, launch a production movement of agriculture, sideline occupations, and handicrafts, organize "sparrow warfare," set up workshops, engage in textile production, raise pigs, and raise chickens. Vice Chairman Rong said: As long as you are determined to produce, gold is everywhere. With good production, life will improve. It is wrong to only be thrifty without working hard in production. Regarding thrift, Vice Chairman Rong asked everyone to learn from Chairman Yang. Secretary-General Sun pointed out that although the Border Government entered the city last year, it did not relax individual agricultural production, and the results were significant, mainly because the leading cadres combined with the masses. The Secretary-General suggested that everyone quickly formulate individual production and savings plans.

    [This Newspaper Report] Although the production movement of the Border Government and directly subordinate organizations has been affected by the fact that many comrades are busy with various tasks during the committee session, they have not relaxed production and frugality even in the midst of great urgency. As far as the author knows, Liu Xinghan and Ren Xiuying (doctor), a husband and wife, have learned to spin cotton and have spun two catties of thread. Director Su of the Post Office and Comrade He Yue have also started to spin cotton. The flour grinding team organized by the Post Office worked for five afternoons, and each person received a bonus of one thousand yuan. Many comrades from the printing factory participated in transportation, carrying documents and books, earning transportation fees to be turned over to the public. Other units, such as the guard team, are enthusiastically engaged in burning charcoal and pressing flowers.

　　杨戎正副主席号召边直同志
    努力生产为人民立功
    【本报特讯】边区政府及直属机关全体工作人员，于十八日上午集会，由杨戎正副主席孙秘书长讲话，动员为人民立功与开展机关生产运动。杨主席说：部队的立功运动，已经开展的很热闹，我们做的还差。要想展开立功运动，必须克服自满情绪及差不多思想与老牛拉大车，推也推不动，拉也拉不动的满不在乎。杨主席号召大家解除各种各样包袱，脚踏实地，为人民建立功劳。还要特别克服住在机关没机会立功的想法，杨主席说：今年是大生产年，这就是立功的机会，每个同志要争取当个模范生产工作者，都要学会作财经工作。戎副主席简要的说明边区财经状况称：现在边区由于蒋军进攻，开支增大，为了打败蒋介石，为人民打天下，我们不得不艰苦奋斗，以迎接光明。戎副主席回忆我区灾荒年间，党政军劳动生产，紧张热烈，及节衣缩食，野菜吃到一百五十多种，党政军民团结一致与群众同甘苦的光荣传统以后，号召大家立即动员起来，开展农业副业手工业的生产运动，组织起来打“麻雀战”，搞作坊，闹纺织，喂猪，养鸡。戎副主席说：只要有心生产，遍地是黄金。生产好了，生活就会改善。不努力生产，光节约是不对的。关于节约方面，戎副主席要大家向杨主席学习。孙秘书长指出，边府去年虽进了城市，并未放松个人农业生产，且成绩很大，主要原因是领导骨干与群众结合。秘书长建议大家赶快订出个人生产节约计划。

    【本报讯】边府及直属机关生产运动，虽因许多同志忙于委员会会期之各种工作，但在十分忙迫中亦未稍松生产节约。据笔者所知，刘兴汉、任秀英（医生）夫妇二人已学会纺花，并纺线二斤。邮局苏局长、何越同志亦开始纺花。邮局组织的磨面小组，劳动五下午，每人分红一千元。印刷厂许多同志参加运输，担送文件书籍，赚运费交公。其它单位如警卫队烧木炭、压花均在热烈进行。
