    The 21st Brigade of the Kuomintang's 88th Division, besieged by our army in Jinxiang, had become turtles in a jar. Fang Xianjue came from Yutai to reinforce them, but was intercepted and nearly 10,000 of his men were wiped out by us along the way. Xue Yue panicked and ordered Zhang Lanfeng to lift the siege. Zhang Lanfeng, who had just had a detachment headquarters and four battalions annihilated by us in Juye, was still reeling from the shock when he received this arduous task. Helpless, he had to take three regiments and his direct subordinates and set out with a stiff upper lip.
    On the 12th, as soon as he reached the Hejiatang and Yangzhuang area south of Juye, he fell into our army's encirclement again. That night, two more battalions were wiped out. At this point, Zhang Lanfeng realized that if he persisted, his entire army would be wiped out, so he decided to break through and flee on the night of the 13th. But by then, our army had already prepared a general offensive and spread a net in the Yangzhuang area.
    As soon as it got dark, the besieged Zhang Lanfeng and his subordinates scattered and tried to break through. But they could not escape the newly laid net. They were captured and disarmed in groups of three or five. Zhang Lanfeng's Major General Senior Staff Officer Zhu Qingchuan and the Fourth Regiment's Major Regiment Adjutant Guo Shou Xian led a large group out of the encirclement and fled all the way to Chengwu. They had not rested for two days and two nights, and this breakout involved a forced march of more than forty miles. When they reached Wanglou, twelve miles north of Chengwu, they were too exhausted to move. They also thought that there would be no Eighth Route Army in this area, so they boldly fell asleep. However, our 213th Unit, which had been ordered to pursue the fleeing enemy soldiers, entered Wanglou at dawn and firmly captured the enemy.
    The vanguard of the 213th Unit—the third squad of the ninth company—was about to leave the west end of the village when the squad leader, Zhang Bingxun, and others were looking for a place to rest. Suddenly, they saw a light to the north of the road. They looked through the crack in the door and saw four Kuomintang soldiers warming themselves by the fire. Thinking they were scattered enemy soldiers who had broken through, they pushed open the door and pointed their guns at them: "Don't move! Surrender your weapons!" The four Kuomintang soldiers obediently surrendered their weapons. "Are there any more inside?" "No." "Even if there aren't, I have to take a look!" They searched three rooms and found them full of Kuomintang soldiers sleeping like dead pigs. Zhang Bingxun and the others immediately captured them as well, seizing a total of thirty-two rifles, three light machine guns, one small cannon, and one pistol. When the enemy south of the road discovered this, they began to fight. Our wise and mobile commanders immediately and quickly deployed the troops, launching a pincer attack on the enemy. One force attacked the large group of enemies south of the road, another force drove northwest from the east end of the village, surrounding the north; another force rushed to a nearby village to the southwest to ambush the fleeing soldiers, immediately intercepting more than twenty enemies.
    The troops quickly deployed, and the commanders and fighters bravely launched a siege and annihilation battle in the village. Zhang Bingxun braved the enemy's fierce fire, climbed a ladder on the north side of the road, and across a road and two houses, threw more than fifty grenades in one go, persisting until our army advanced to the south side of the road. In the north of the road, a group of enemies were stubbornly resisting in a courtyard. Our mortars then cordially greeted them, firing eleven rounds in a row at an angle of eighty-three degrees, hitting the target with every shot, and quickly resolving the enemy.
    A large number of enemies were still trapped in the building in the south of the road, desperately resisting. Our flat-trajectory guns then impolitely aimed at them from the east, blasting the eaves and hitting the windows, finally causing the building to collapse entirely. When the eighth squad leader of the ninth company, Yu Likuan, and others were advancing to the south side of the road, because there was no ladder, he used his shoulders to help everyone climb in. In the end, he could not enter the courtyard himself, so he pushed open the door and rushed in, resulting in him being wounded. But he was still directing everyone to charge, capturing fifteen enemies in one courtyard. The eighth squad deputy was grazed by shrapnel, and carried the wounded ninth squad leader down from the roof, and also seized five guns. The seventh squad leader, Wang Changxiao, used his machine gun to block the enemy in one courtyard, finally forcing the enemy to surrender their weapons. Shao Erzai, a Kuomintang soldier who had been liberated by the seventh company's ninth squad, encountered three enemies. The enemies' pistols were all pointed at him, but he also pointed his gun at the enemies and shouted: "If you fire, I will kill you first!" The three enemies obediently surrendered their weapons. When his squad leader was killed, he automatically directed everyone to charge, teaching the new recruits how to conceal themselves and how to attack; when his grenades ran out, he went to the seventh, eighth squads, and second platoon to borrow some. Duan Shaozhen of the special service company fired his machine gun horizontally, forcing the three enemies in the courtyard who refused to surrender to finally surrender their weapons. In the end, only the large building in the southwest corner remained, and even that building was about to collapse from the artillery fire. The enemy had no hope left. Only then did the Major General Staff Officer Zhu Qingchuan and Major Regiment Adjutant Guo Yongxian despairingly raise the white flag of surrender. A large number of enemies were captured, and a large number of guns and ammunition were seized. The commanders, fighters, communicators, and even the grooms were all dancing with joy, each carrying several guns and wearing ammunition all over their bodies. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 14th, the enemy was completely annihilated.

    王楼追歼战
    君谦
    被我军围困在金乡城内的蒋军八八师二一旅，成了瓮中鳖，方先觉从鱼台来增援，在中途又被我消灭了近万人，薛岳慌了手脚，就又督令张岚峰去解围。这个刚在巨野被我消灭了一个支队部及四个营的张岚峰，正在惊心未定的时候，忽又接到这个艰巨的任务，无可奈何，只好带着三个团和他的直属队，硬着头皮出动了。
    十二日，刚到了巨南的贺家堂、杨庄一带，就又陷入我军的包围圈中，当夜即被消灭了两个多营。这时张岚峰也认识到再坚持下去，一定全军覆没，就决定在十三日夜突围逃命，但那时我军已一面布置总攻击，一面在杨庄一带，撒下了天罗地网。
    天刚黑，被围的张岚峰即与部下四散突围了。但他们却逃不出我们新撒的天罗地网，他们是三个、五个，一批两批的被俘缴了枪，张岚峰的少将高级参谋祝清川及其第四团少校团附郭首先率领一大股突出包围圈后，一直往城武溃去，他们两天两夜没有休息，这次突围又急行了四十余里，在到了城武北十二里的王楼时，实在疲乏得走不动了，一面他们也以为这地方不会有八路军来的，竟大胆酣睡起来。可是我奉命追击敌人溃兵的二一三部队，恰在拂晓时进入了王楼，将敌人牢牢的抓住了。
    二一三部队的前哨——九连三班，在将出村西头时，班长张炳勋等要找个地方，忽见路北有火明，从门缝里一望，见里面有四个蒋军正在烤火，他以为是敌人突出的散兵，遂推门而入，以枪指住了他们：“不要动！缴枪！”四个蒋军遂驯服的缴了枪，“里面还有吗”？“没有了”，“没有，我也得看看！”在三个屋子里一搜，里面睡满了像死猪似的蒋军，张炳勋等遂立即也将他们俘虏了，共缴步枪三二支，轻机枪三挺，小炮一门，匣枪一支。这么一来，路南的敌人发觉了，打起来了，我们英明机动的指挥员，遂立即迅速的将部队布置开，对敌人展开钳形夹击，一股钳击路南的大股敌人，一部从村东头斜驱西北，包围了北面；另一部则急驰到西南的附近村，伏击溃兵，当即截住了二十余敌人。
    部队迅速的摆开了，指战员们即勇猛的在村内展开了围歼战，张炳勋冒着敌人激烈的火力，在路北爬上梯子，隔着一条路和两间屋子，一气投弹五十多个，一直坚持到我军往道南发展时，路北的一个院里有一批敌人在顽抗着，我们的迫击炮即殷勤招待了他们，以八三度的角度，弹弹命中的一气打了十一发，很快的将敌人解决了。
    大批敌人仍困守在路南楼院里拚命顽抗着，我们的平射炮于是从东面不客气的对准了他们，打垮了楼沿，打中了楼窗，终于打的楼要整个坍倒下来。九连八班长于立宽等在往道南发展时，因为没有梯子，他用肩将大家托进去，最后他一个人不能进院，即推开门往里冲，结果他负伤了，但他仍在指挥大家冲锋，在一院里俘住了十五个敌人，八班副被弹皮擦伤后，从房上背下伤了的九班长，还缴了五枝枪。七班长王长孝端着机枪封锁住了一个院内的敌人，终于迫使敌人缴了枪。七连九班邵耳砦解放过来的蒋步成碰到了三个敌人，敌人的匣枪都张着机头对准了他，他也以枪对准了敌人喝道：“你要开火，我就先打死你！”三个敌人驯服的缴了枪；当他的班长牺牲了时，他即自动的指挥大家冲击，教给新兵如何隐蔽和如何进攻；当他的手榴弹打完了时，他即到七、八班和二排去借。特务连段少珍平端着机枪打，迫使院里三个不缴枪的敌人终于缴了枪，最后只剩了西南隅的大楼，而大楼也被炮打得摇摇欲倒。敌人已没有什么希望了，那个少将参议祝清川和少校团附郭永先，才绝望的摆出了投降的白旗，大批的敌人就俘了，大批的枪弹缴过来，指战员及通信员，甚至马夫，都手舞足蹈的每个人都扛了几枝枪，和佩挂了满身的子弹，在十四日晨八时，敌人全部被歼灭了。
