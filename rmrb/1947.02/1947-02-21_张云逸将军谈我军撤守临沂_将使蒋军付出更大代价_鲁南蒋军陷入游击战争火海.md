Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th: General Zhang Yunyi, Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army and Deputy Commander of the Shandong Military Region, made the following statement on the 16th regarding the voluntary withdrawal from Linyi: This time, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated all possible forces and made a desperate gamble to launch a large-scale offensive against the Lunan liberated area. In order to lure the enemy deep and annihilate the invading army in large numbers, it was absolutely necessary to temporarily withdraw from Linyi city voluntarily. Since the Chiang army invaded Lunan last September, more than ten brigades have been annihilated. After Chiang Kai-shek's army enters the empty city of Linyi, it will have to pay an even greater price. The most effective way to defend the liberated areas is to annihilate the invading Chiang army in large numbers. When the annihilation reaches a certain level, it will not only be possible to stop their offensive, but also to drive them out of the liberated areas. At that time, Linyi city, like all other temporarily abandoned cities in the liberated areas, will certainly be recovered. As long as the front and rear, and the military and civilians in the Chiang-occupied areas work hard together, this victorious future will soon arrive.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th: The Chiang army, which has occupied Tancheng and Linyi, has fallen into a sea of guerrilla warfare. Militiamen in a certain district of Tancheng resisted the enemy invading from the wharf, persisted for three days and nights, laid mines and ambushes seven times, and killed more than 50 enemies. Ingenious guerrilla groups went deep into the occupied areas to carry out activities, capturing special agents Liu ×× and "Homecoming Legion" leader Huang Zhuotong and executing them according to law. The large wooden bridge over the Yi River, painstakingly built by the enemy at the wharf, was destroyed overnight by the local militia. Explosion teams and local soldiers formed by the people of Linyi County have been dispatched to harass the invaders. Before the People's Liberation Army and the residents of Linyi withdrew from the urban area, the work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields was carried out extremely thoroughly. Food, clothing, pots, bowls, and utensils were all transported away. A landlord surnamed Zhang even buried an empty coffin underground, expressing bitterly: "Those bastards can't sleep in this coffin either."

　　张云逸将军谈我军撤守临沂
    将使蒋军付出更大代价
    鲁南蒋军陷入游击战争火海
    【新华社山东十九日电】新四军副军长兼山东军区副司令员张云逸将军，为主动撤出临沂，于十六日发表谈话如下：这次蒋介石集中一切可能调动的兵力，孤注一掷，向鲁南解放区大举进攻，我们为了诱敌深入，大量歼灭进犯军，暂时从临沂城主动撤退，是完全必要的。从去年九月蒋军进犯鲁南以来，已被歼灭了十个旅以上的兵力。蒋介石军进入临沂空城之后，还要付出更多的代价。保卫解放区最有效的方法是大量歼灭进犯的蒋军，当歼灭到一定程度时，不仅可以停止其进攻，而且可以把它打出解放区去。到那时候，临沂城如同其他解放区一切暂时放弃的城市一样，是一定可以收复的。只要前线后方及蒋占区军民大家努力，这个胜利的前途，不久就可以到来。
    【新华社山东十九日电】侵占郯城、临沂蒋军，已陷入游击战争之火海中。郯城某区民兵曾抗击码头出犯敌人，坚持三昼夜，埋雷与设伏七次，毙敌五十余名。精巧之游击小组深入侵占区活动，捕捉特务刘××与“还乡团”头子黄灼通等正法。码头敌人费尽心血搭起之沂河大木桥，被当地民兵连夜破坏。临沂县人民所组成之爆炸队及地方子弟兵，已纷纷出动袭扰侵犯者。此次人民解放军及临沂居民于撤离城区前，坚壁清野工作进行极为彻底，粮食衣物锅碗用具，均输送一空。一张姓地主把空棺材也埋藏地下，他恨恨的表示：“这付棺材也不能叫那些王八蛋睡了去”。
