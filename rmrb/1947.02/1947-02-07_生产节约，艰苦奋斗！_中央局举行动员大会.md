Production and Thrift, Hard Struggle!
    The Central Bureau Holds a Mobilization Meeting

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] "Production and thrift, hard struggle!" has become the slogan for comrades in the Central Bureau organs to welcome victory. To transform this slogan into the action motto of cadres in all organs, the Central Bureau convened a production and thrift meeting for all directly subordinate units on the 31st of last month. On the same evening, the Central Bureau headquarters held a mobilization meeting for all cadres to thoroughly eliminate the ideas of cadres "not engaging in labor," "extravagant waste," and "relying solely on the public." Dozens of representatives from directly subordinate organs attended, and the heads of various departments of the Central Bureau personally carried out mobilization, filling the entire venue with confidence and determination for thrift and production.

    Comrade Zhang Panshi, who attended despite being ill, spoke first. Based on the current overall victorious situation, he pointed out: Today, our goal of production and thrift is not for anything else but to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek's invasion, welcome the arrival of a bright victory as soon as possible, no longer increase the burden on the people, and also ensure a certain standard of living for ourselves. It is especially important to strengthen the labor concept of each of our comrades so that everyone can work with the masses to promote the large-scale production movement in the entire region. He then emphasized: What hinders the development of our production and thrift movement today is not that we have no methods, but the ideological problems of our comrades. He said: With the experience and training of 1943 and 1944, we do not worry about not having methods for production and thrift this year. Today, our biggest obstacle is the "peaceful thought" in our minds and the "disdain for labor" thoughts of some comrades after entering the cities. As long as we overcome these ideological obstacles, various good methods for production and thrift will be created immediately. Therefore, Comrade Panshi called on everyone to quickly make up their minds, eliminate various thoughts hindering production and thrift, and prepare to launch this year's large-scale production movement together with the masses.

    After Comrade Ping Jiesan reported on the organ's production and thrift plan, Secretary-General Tao gave a very detailed explanation of the organizational leadership issues for individual production. He praised the achievements of the organ's production last year, but also criticized the fact that due to the obstacles of peaceful illusions, each comrade's personal production did not achieve any results last year. In the future, in order to overcome the difficulties on the road to victory, we must not only do a better job in the organ's production but also do a good job in individual production. He said: Chairman Mao taught us that to defeat the enemy, we must have three kinds of troops. In addition to the fighting army, we must also have a political and cultural army and a large production army. The three are indispensable. Therefore, each of us must regard completing production as equally important as completing work and study. Regarding the stipulation of each comrade's production task, Secretary-General Tao proposed: Egalitarianism should not be adopted, but it should be determined based on each comrade's production capacity (labor intensity and working hours). Regarding the direction of production, he believes that it should be actively increasing wealth, not simply a profit-making point of view. Therefore, the Central Bureau organs should focus on the handicraft textile industry, and each department can combine its own business to carry out other production. In terms of organizational leadership, a production committee should be organized to be responsible for promoting leadership, and the branch should guarantee completion. In order to carry out individual production to the end, Secretary-General Tao also proposed: Every time a cadre is transferred, there must be a production appraisal. The unfulfilled part of the production task must be completed in the new position.

    Finally, General Branch Secretary Wu Renwen called on everyone to resolutely accept the production and thrift task given to us by the Party this year and guarantee its resolute and thorough completion. After the meeting, all comrades of the Central Bureau enthusiastically discussed the decisions of the meeting and prepared their own production plans. Secretary Li of the Administrative Office voluntarily proposed to complete three hours of production tasks every day, guaranteeing to spin one and a half liang of cotton a day. The movement to formulate plans is in full swing in various departments.

    生产节约，艰苦奋斗！
    中央局举行动员大会
    【本报特讯】“生产节约，艰苦奋斗!”已成中央局机关同志迎接胜利的口号。中央局为使这一口号变成各机关干部的行动口号，特于上月三十一日，召开直属各单位生产节约会议；中央局本单位，当晚又举行了机关全体干部的动员大会，以彻底清除干部“不事劳动”、“铺张浪费”、“专靠公家”的思想。数十位直属机关的代表，均列席参加，中央局各部长，亦亲自进行动员，全场充满着节约生产的信心和意志。
    带病参加的张磐石同志首先发言，他根据目前整个胜利的形势指出：今天我们生产节约的目的，不是为了其他，而是为了迅速打垮蒋介石进犯，早日迎接光明胜利的到来；不再加重人民的负担，还要保证自己一定的生活水准。特别重要的，也是为了加强锻炼我们每个同志的劳动观念，使大家很好的同群众一道生产，去推进全区群众的大生产运动。接着他强调指出：今天阻碍我们生产节约运动开展的，不是我们没有办法，而是我们同志们的思想问题。他说：我们有了四三、四四年的经验与锻炼，我们今年的生产节约，是不愁没有办法的。今天我们的最大的障碍，是我们头脑中的“和平思想”以及一部分同志进了城市之后“轻视劳动”的思想。只要克服了这些思想障碍，生产节约的各种好办法就会立刻创造出来。因此磐石同志号召大家：赶快下定决心，清除障碍生产节约的各种思想，准备和群众一起，开展今年的大生产运动。
    平杰三同志报告机关生产节约的计划之后，陶秘书长对个人生产的组织领导问题，作了极为详尽的解释。他表扬了去年机关生产的成绩，同时也批评了由于和平幻想的障碍，去年每个同志的个人生产，是没有作出什么成绩来的。今后，为了克服胜利道路上的困难，我们不但要更加作好机关生产，而且也要作好个人的生产。他说：毛主席教导我们，要打垮敌人，必须要有三种军队，除了打仗的军队外，还要有政治文化军和生产的大军，三者缺一不可。因此，我们每个同志，必须把完成生产与完成工作学习看成同等重要。在规定每个同志生产任务上，陶秘书提出：不应采取平均主义，而应根据每个同志生产能力（劳动强度和工作时间）来决定。关于生产方向，他认为应是积极的增加财富，而不是单纯的营利观点。因此中央局机关应以手工纺织业为主，各部并可结合自己的业务进行其他的生产。在组织领导上，应组织生产委员会，负责推动领导，支部加以保证完成。为了把个人生产一直贯彻到底，陶秘书长并提议：每个干部调动时，都须有生产鉴定。生产任务未完成部分，必须在新岗位上去完成。
    最后，总支书记吴人文同志号召大家，坚决接受党所给予我们今年的生产节约任务，并保证坚决彻底完成。会后全中央局同志，均热烈讨论大会决定，并准备自己的生产计划。行政处李秘书自动提出每日完成三小时的生产任务，保证一天纺一两半棉花，现订制计划的运动正在各部火热进行中。
