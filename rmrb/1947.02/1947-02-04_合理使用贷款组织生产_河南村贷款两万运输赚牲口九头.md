　　Reasonable Use of Loans to Organize Production
    Henan Village Earns Nine Head of Livestock from 20,000 Yuan Loan for Transportation
    [Report from this newspaper] Last year, Li Cheng county granted a total of 8 million yuan in loans. Agricultural loans accounted for 4.5 million yuan, textile loans 2.5 million yuan, and credit loans 1 million yuan. The primary purpose of these loans was to organize mass production. Recently, the Jinnan Bank County Branch and the County Government Construction Section conducted thorough investigations, summarized experiences and lessons learned as follows:

    I. They played a significant role in organizing textile and transportation cooperation, and various localities have created valuable experiences. For example, Zhao Muqun, a labor hero from Henan Village, borrowed 20,000 yuan, added 20,000 yuan of his own, and bought a mule to lead transportation efforts. Twenty days later, he earned 60,000 yuan in foreign currency, and then transferred the 20,000 yuan loan to Zhang Peiyi to buy a donkey for transportation. In less than a month, he earned back the price of the donkey and then re-loaned it to others. In this way, from spring to October, the entire village earned four mules and five donkeys with these 20,000 yuan in loans. In the autumn, they used these 20,000 yuan to organize 20 head of livestock for transportation for seven days, earning a net profit of 200,000 yuan in foreign currency. Another example is Nie Ying, the vice chairman of the women's association in Dongwang Village, who borrowed 20,000 yuan in textile loans from the government. She made ten looms, bought three sets of steel heddles and 37 jin of cotton. The enthusiasm of women for textile production was greatly enhanced. They spun the cotton into cloth and exchanged the cloth for more cotton, rotating in this way. By December, they had spun a total of 413 jin of yarn and woven 2,337 chi of cloth. In addition to providing clothing for all the textile women’s families for the change of seasons, they repaid the loans and earned 12 looms, with an additional surplus of over 20,000 yuan in foreign currency. This method of centralized use of loans generally achieved success.

    II. According to inspections and statistics, a large portion of the loans did not play any role. Some villages left the loans idle after receiving them, such as Jia Village and Beiliu Village. Some village cadres took the loans and did not invest them in agricultural and sideline production, but instead used them recklessly for their own purposes. For example, the village chief of Yan Jing Village used 20,000 yuan of cooperative loans to buy land for himself privately. The same was true in Yan Nan and other villages. Some even took textile loans to engage in business. These can all serve as lessons for the future.

　　合理使用贷款组织生产
    河南村贷款两万运输赚牲口九头
    【本报讯】黎城去年全县共贷款八百万元。农贷四百五十万，纺织贷二百五十万，信用贷一百万。各项贷款用途主要是组织群众生产。近经冀南银行县分行和县政府建设科深入彻底检查，总结经验教训如下：
    一、在组织纺织运输合作方面，起了不小的作用，各地已创造了不少宝贵的经验：例如河南村劳英赵木群贷款两万元，加上自己的两万元，买了一头骡子，领导运输。二十天后赚洋六万元，又将两万贷款转给张培义，买毛驴一头，也搞运输；不到一月把驴价赚回后又转贷给别人。如此，从春天到十月，全村靠这两万贷款赚下骡子四头，毛驴五头。秋后，又用这两万贷，组织二十头牲口运输七天，净赚洋二十万元。又如东旺村妇女会副主席聂英，向政府贷了两万元纺织贷款，做了十部织布机，买了三付钢铮和三十七斤棉花，纺妇生产情绪大大提高，把花纺织成布又换成花，轮回倒换。到十二月为止，她们共纺线四百一十三斤，织布二千三百三十七尺；除各纺织妇全家换季外，还了贷款，赚下织机十二架，另余洋两万多元。这种集中使用贷款办法，一般均获得成功。
    二、据检查统计，另有很大一部分贷款没有起什么作用。有的将贷款领回村闲搁着不动。如家庄、北流村便是。有的村干把贷款领回不投入农副业生产，由自己拿着滥化。如岩井村村长把两万元的合作社贷款私人买了地；岩南等村也是如此。也有把纺织贷款拿去作买卖的。这些都可作为今后的教训。
