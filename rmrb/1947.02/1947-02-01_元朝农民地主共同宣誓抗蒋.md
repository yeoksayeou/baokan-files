　　Yuan Dynasty Peasants and Landlords Jointly Swear to Resist Chiang
    [Jinan, Weixian, 28th dispatch] Landlords in Yaoshan and the Yuan Dynasty are resisting Chiang together with the peasants. Li Qingtian, a landlord in Xiliang Village, Yaoshan, after the settlement, realized that it was wrong for him to exploit and oppress the masses in the past; it was completely correct for the masses to reason and settle accounts with him. He understood that only by uniting well with the peasants and following the path of Zhang Yongtai can he live a peaceful life. Therefore, he swore to the masses: 1. I will not bear grudges against the Farmers' Association, and regardless of whether Chiang's troops come or not, I will never retaliate. 2. If the masses suffer losses because of me, my whole family will guarantee it. 3. I will resolutely follow the Farmers' Association, obey the leadership of the village cadres, and resist Chiang together with the peasants. Xu Fengxiang, Xu Fengyi, and other landlords in Dongmaling, Fifth District of the Yuan Dynasty, recognized their past mistakes of exploiting and oppressing the masses and began to participate in productive labor. When Chiang's bandits invaded northern Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, and entered our Jinan border area, all the villagers held a meeting to swear an oath. Peasants and landlords alike agreed that Chiang Kai-shek was selling out the country and destroying everyone's peaceful and democratic life. Finally, they jointly took a self-defense oath.

　　元朝农民地主共同宣誓抗蒋
    【冀南威县廿八日电】尧山、元朝地主随农民共同抗蒋。尧山西良村地主李清天，清算以后，认识到自己过去剥削压迫群众是不对的；群众给自己说理算账是完全地出卖中华民族，只有和农民好好团结起来，走张永泰的道路，才能过安生日子。所以他向群众宣誓：一、不给农会记仇，不管蒋军来不来，总不报复。二、如果从我身上使群众受了损失，有我一家子人作担保。三、坚决跟着农会走，服从村干领导，和农民一起抗蒋。元朝五区东马陵地主徐凤祥、徐凤义等，认清过去自己剥削压迫群众的错误，开始参加生产劳动。在蒋贼北犯进入我冀南边境，全村群众开会宣誓时，农民地主一致认为蒋介石是在卖大家的国，是在破坏大家的和平民主生活。最后共同进行自卫宣誓。
