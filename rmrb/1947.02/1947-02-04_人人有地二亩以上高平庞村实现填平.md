　　Everyone Has More Than Two Mu of Land: Gaoping Pang Village Achieves Leveling
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Pang Village, District One, Gaoping County, has thoroughly realized "land to the tiller" through the leveling and patching-up movement. The entire village now has an average of more than two mu of land per person. At the celebration of the victory of emancipation, the chairman of the farmers' association summarized that in the past year, the village farmers' struggle against feudal landlords and local bullies resulted in a total of 1,562.25 mu of land, 173 shi and 7.6 dou of grain, 1,572 pieces of clothing, and 2,888 silver dollars. These fruits were distributed in eight installments. The first distribution only benefited 46 households, but the number of households benefiting increased with each subsequent distribution. Especially during this total liquidation and all-out emancipation movement, all the farmers in the village were involved. When distributing the fruits, more than 30 households with deficits were filled in first, and then the rest was distributed equally. This time, except for 13 households who were targets of struggle, all the remaining 215 households received their share, achieving complete emancipation and uniting the poor, lower-middle, and middle peasants. During this distribution of fruits, village cadres announced in front of the masses that they had received more in the past and would not receive anything this time. The masses all said, "The cadres truly serve the people." Therefore, the cadres and the masses were even more united. Secondly, the issue of draught animals for the coming year has been completely resolved in this distribution of fruits. Based on the opinions of the masses, 440,000 yuan obtained from the struggle was used to buy 17 head of livestock, which were then sold to middle peasants at a low price. The remaining money was used to buy more livestock. This time, about 15 more were bought and distributed to those with large deficits. In this way, the whole village increased by more than 30 head of livestock, and together with the existing livestock, the level of draught animal power has largely recovered to the pre-war level.
