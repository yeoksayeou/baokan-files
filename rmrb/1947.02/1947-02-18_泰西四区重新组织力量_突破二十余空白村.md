　　【Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 16th】After reorganizing its forces and launching land reform, the fourth district of Taixi has now seen action in over twenty unoccupied villages. The Fourth District launched the "Land to the Tiller" campaign in September of last year. A pre-New Year inspection revealed that there were still more than twenty unoccupied villages. In the past, many meetings had been held in these villages, but the peasants did not receive land. The masses said, "It's all thunder and no rain." This time, forces were organized, and more than twenty turned-over heroes were sent to these unoccupied villages. After a month of struggle, the masses were mobilized and land was distributed. Experience gained during this work has proven that the theory of stages, which does not accord with the demands of the masses, is incorrect. In the past, struggle, distribution of fruits, and reorganization were mechanically divided, chilling the enthusiasm of the masses. This time, based on the demands of the masses, the iron was struck while it was hot. Distribution of fruits was seized during the struggle, and the mechanical method of distributing land to poor peasants and grain to middle peasants was overcome in the distribution method. The land was leveled and the grain was distributed according to grade, so that the households whose land was leveled also received grain to avoid immediate starvation. In the past, reorganization was carried out after the fruits were distributed. This time, grasping the demands of the masses, it was reorganized in a timely manner. New peasant association leaders emerged in ten villages, and the peasant association members supported them. Secondly, experience shows that winter school is a powerful place to promote land reform. Relying on winter school to talk about current events, breaking the masses' ideas of changing the world, and inspiring the masses' will to struggle.

　　泰西四区重新组织力量
    突破二十余空白村
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】泰西四区经过重新组织力量展开土地改革之后，现在二十几个空白村已行动起来。四区去年九月即开展了土地还家运动，年前检查尚有二十多个空白村，这些村的过去也开过不少会，但农民并没得到土地，群众说：“光打雷不下雨”。这次组织了力量，把二十多个翻身英雄派赴这些空白村，经一月斗争，群众发动起来，分配了土地。在这段工作中，经验证明不根据群众要求的阶段论是不对的，过去把斗争、分果实、整理组织等，机械划分，冷了群众热情，这次是根据群众的要求，趁热打铁，斗争中抓紧分果实，分法上也克服了贫农分地、中农分粮的机械分法。地填平粮按等级分，被填平的户，同样得到粮食，免得眼前挨饿。过去整理组织，等着分了果实才搞，这次抓着群众要求，及时整理，十个村产生了新的农会领袖，农会员都很拥护。其次一个经验：冬学是推动土地改革的有力场所，依靠冬学谈时事，打破群众的变天思想，启发了群众斗争意志。
