    Li Cheng Militia Political Training Experience
    Conduct Grievance Meetings to Raise Awareness
    Oppose Purely Technical Viewpoints
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 9th] Li Cheng’s winter militia political rectification, combined with mass movements, has raised the class and armed consciousness of the militia, and has developed, examined, and reformed the militia, making the people's armed forces stronger and more consolidated. The following two experiences were obtained during the process: First, enhance the class consciousness of the militia through grievance meetings. Some new and old middle peasant youth militia members do not have a deep understanding of feudal exploitation in the old society. They should conduct grievance meetings together with the peasants who have turned over to enlighten their class consciousness until they actively participate in the struggle. Li Bingcan, a militia member from Zhaodian, said after listening to his father's grievance: He must fight the "Dog Er" landlord, and mobilized his younger brother to join the militia. Another part of the militia was directly exploited and oppressed by the landlords. Once they complained, they went from bitterness to pain, from pain to hatred, and connected with other people in suffering, stepping forward to fight. The political rectification of the militia in Xiwu, Dongwang, and Nanmo villages, combined with grievance meetings, has significantly improved the quality. A total of 102 activists emerged in the turn-over movement, including 62 militia members, who became important pillars in the peasants' turn-over movement. Second, militia development and review. The development of the militia should be carried out at any time according to the improvement of the masses' class consciousness, and it must go through the mass line of cadre review, militia discussion, and approval. It is not appropriate for some villages to simply conduct current affairs education without going through grievance meetings and participating in the turn-over, and then think that the masses have "armed consciousness" and develop in large numbers. Some villages have undergone the turn-over, and the peasants have also had class armed consciousness, but they emphasize that they should be put to the end of the movement and then participate after current affairs education. This also violates the practice of developing a large number of militia members during and after the turn-over. The review of militia cadres should be tested through the turn-over. Those who have sheltered landlords in the movement or preserved their property and still have poor awareness should be resolutely replaced. At the same time, the selection of cadres must start from a class perspective and oppose purely technical viewpoints. Resolutely purge spies who have a fairly close connection with feudal landlords who have infiltrated the militia ranks. It must be clear that the militia is the class armed force of the peasants. The militia review certainly requires caution and meticulousness, but the requirements cannot be too high. When Dongguan reviewed the militia, they asked one by one whether they could fight. This "eliteism" view will limit the development of the militia.

    黎城民兵政训经验
    进行诉苦提高觉悟
    反对单纯技术观点
    【本报太行九日电】黎城冬季民兵政治整训，结合群运进行，提高了民兵阶级与武装自觉，并发展审查与改造了民兵，使人民武装更加壮大巩固。在进行中获得如下两点经验：一、经过诉苦提高民兵的阶级觉悟。一部分新旧中农青年民兵，由于对旧社会封建剥削体会不深刻，应和农民翻身组在一起进行诉苦，以启发其阶级自觉，直到积极参与斗争。赵店民兵李炳参，听了他父亲诉苦后，即说：非和狗儿地主干不行，并动员他弟弟参加了民兵。另一部分民兵是自己直接受过地主剥削压迫，一经诉苦，则由苦到痛，由痛到恨，并以苦连苦串通人别，挺身起而斗争。西仵、东旺、南陌三村民兵政治整训结合诉苦，质量显著提高；翻身运动中共涌现出积极分子一百零二人，其中有六十二名民兵，成了农民翻身运动中的重要支柱。二、民兵发展与审查。发展民兵，应根据群众阶级觉悟提高随时进行，并一定要经过干部审查民兵讨论与批准的群众路线。有些村不经过诉苦和参加翻身，只简单进行一下时事教育，就认为群众有了“武装自觉”，大量发展是不妥的；也有些村经过翻身，农民亦已有了阶级武装自觉，却强调放到运动结束，再经时事教育后始能参加，这也是违背了翻身中和翻身后大量发展民兵的做法。对民兵干部的审查，应经过翻身考验，在运动中包庇地主或给其保存资财至今觉悟仍差者，应坚决撤换。同时选择干部一定要从阶级观点出发，反对单纯技术观点。对混进民兵阵营中与封建地主有相当密切连系的奸细分子，则要坚决清洗。必须明确民兵是农民的阶级武装，民兵审察固然需要慎重细致，但要求条件亦不能过高。东关审查民兵时，一名一名的问能不能打仗，这种“精兵主义”的观点，是会限制民兵发展的。
