　　Taiyue 21st Sub-district Health Center Work Competition
    Model Medical Workers Emerge in Large Numbers
    [Report from our Taiyue Correspondent on the 20th] In the work competition at the 21st Sub-district Health Center, where all staff members are ensuring that discharging the wounded means ensuring victory, many model workers have emerged. Model doctor Ma Chongli, aside from one hour of study every morning, spends the rest of his time working in the ward. He's constantly asking, "How are you doing now?" or "Has your illness relapsed?" The convalescing soldiers excitedly say, "Doctor Ma doesn't sleep at night; he knows if you just call out, and he cares more than our own parents." Model female nurse Fan Bin is especially considerate of the wounded. She takes over early before dawn, spends the day going back and forth in the ward, caring for more than ten wounded soldiers single-handedly, and also helps with work in other wards. Late at night, she still quietly asks the wounded soldiers, "Comrade, wake up, would you like a drink of water?" Before leaving, she comforts them, saying, "Comrade, rest well!" Quartermaster Yuan Qiushuan never expresses dissatisfaction, no matter how many meals a day the wounded and sick need. He says, "The wounded comrades have shed blood for us; what does it matter to cook a few more meals?" When electing model workers, Old Yuan won second place. Because of the active work of all the staff, the wounded and sick recover quickly. Convalescent Han Qingzhou said, "When I was injured, I felt pessimistic about going to the hospital, but after coming to this hospital and seeing them serving the convalescents like this, I realized my past thinking was wrong."

　　太岳廿一分区卫生所工作竞赛
    模范医务人员辈出
    【本报太岳二十日电】二十一分区卫生所全体工作人员在保证伤员出院就是保证胜利到来的工作竞赛中，出现了不少模范工作者。模范医生马崇礼每天除早上一个钟头学习外，其余时间全在病室里工作，他不是问这个“现在你怎样？”就是问那个“你的病又犯了没有？”休养员都激动的说：“马医生夜里就不睡觉，叫一声都知道，真比父母还关心。”模范女看护员樊斌特别体贴伤员，天不明就接班，白天在病室里转来转去，一人照顾十多个伤员，还帮助其他病室工作，深夜她还小声叫伤员：“同志，醒一醒，喝水不？”临走时还安慰的说：“同志好好休息吧！”炊事班长原秋拴，不管伤病员一天吃几顿饭，从没有表示不满，他当说：“伤员同志为咱们流了血，多作几次饭有什么要紧。”选举模范工作者时，老原获得了第二名。由于全体工作人员积极工作伤病员迅速恢复健康，休养员韩庆周说：“我负伤时想到住医院就悲观起来，可是到这医院后，看到他们这样为休养员服务，就回想到过去的认识不对”。
