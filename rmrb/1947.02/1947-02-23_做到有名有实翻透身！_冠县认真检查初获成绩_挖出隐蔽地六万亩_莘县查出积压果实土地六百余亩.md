[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 21st dispatch] In Guan County's land reform review, it was discovered that due to the leadership failing to follow the mass line, most farmers in the Sixth and Eighth Districts only had "half their bodies" reformed, or "empty" reform. According to investigations in these two districts, out of 134 landlords, only 112 were liquidated. At the same time, the feudal vestiges of over 100 rich peasants were not eliminated, and they possessed a total of over 62,000 mu of land. However, according to statistics from 8,000 villages in the Sixth and Eighth Districts, 115 middle peasants and 23 poor peasants were struggled against, and their property was also damaged. Sectarianism was prevalent in 77 villages in the two districts. Although nearly 20,000 mu of land was recovered during the investigation and reduction of rent and interest, the spirit of leveling and compensating was not implemented in the distribution of fruits. Instead, they were sold at a set price. Due to the low purchasing power of the extremely poor, most of the land fell into the hands of those above the poor peasant class, resulting in each extremely poor person receiving an average of less than 1.3 mu of vacant land. The population of the two districts is nearly 40,000, but only 16,938 men and women participated in the investigation and reduction movement, less than 40% of the total population. The leadership has now reorganized its forces and launched an offensive against feudal rule, sorting out the fruits to thoroughly complete the leveling and compensation.

[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 21st dispatch] After in-depth investigation in Shen County, it was discovered that many villages still have outstanding problems. Currently, they are making every effort to go deep into the masses to ensure that farmers are thoroughly reformed. During this land reform review in the county, it was discovered that in all seven districts, regardless of new or old areas, there were some problems that urgently needed to be resolved: First, the fruits were not distributed fairly and reasonably to the farmers, and village cadres were severely corrupt and enriched themselves. For example, in 24 villages in the First District, 243 mu of land and over 700,000 yuan were not distributed. In Huangloudian in the Seventh District, there were still over 400 mu of land that had not been distributed. Even if land was distributed to farmers in some villages, the old deeds of the landlords were not taken out to establish new deeds. Second, the village organizations were unsound, and the mobilization of the masses was insufficient. When the war approached Jinnan, some villagers wanted to return the fruits to the landlords. For example, Gong Zhuang ××× in the First District, after hearing the sound of artillery, ran to the landlord's house and said: "Sir, I won't keep your things for you, here you go." Third, individual landlords were omitted. For example, in Wang Zhuang in the Second District, there were four landlords whose class status had not been changed, and a large landlord in the Fifth District was missed. In addition, there were also problems such as cadres buying fruits at low prices and harming middle peasants. All cadres in the county are now working hard to go deep into the masses, determined to ensure that the masses are truly thoroughly reformed economically and politically. In addition, similar problems have been found in the Qi County review.

　　做到有名有实翻透身！
    冠县认真检查初获成绩
    挖出隐蔽地六万亩
    莘县查出积压果实土地六百余亩
    【本报冀南二十一日电】冠县翻身检查中发现因领导上没走群众路线，六、八区多数农民翻了“半个身”，或翻了“空身”。据两区调查，地主共一百三十四户，被清算的仅一百十二户，同时还有百余户富农的封建尾巴没有割掉，共拥有土地六万二千余亩。但据六、八区八千个村的统计，中农被斗者一百一十五户，贫农二十三户财物上也受到损失，两个区有七十七村闹宗派。虽于查减中收回近两万亩的土地，但分果实没有贯彻填平补齐的精神，而以定价出卖的办法，由于赤贫购买力低，土地大部落在贫农以上阶层手中，以致赤贫每人所得空地平均不足一亩三分。两个区人口近四万，参加查减运动的男女仅一万六千九百三十八人，不及全人口的百分之四十。现领导上已重新组织力量，向封建统治展开攻势，整理果实以彻底完成填补。
    【本报冀南二十一日电】莘县经深入检查后，发现很多村尚有遗留问题，现正全力深入群众，决使农民翻透身。该县此次翻身检查中，发现全县七个区不论新老地区，都存在着些急待解决的问题：一、果实没有公平合理分给农民，村干严重贪污自肥。如一区二十四个村庄，土地二百四十三亩、款七十余万未分下去，七区黄楼店尚有四百余亩土地未分，有的村土地即便分给农民，也未要出地主的旧契进行立新契工作。二、村组织不健全，发动群众不充分。当战争迫近冀南后，有些村庄群众又想将果实送回地主，如一区供庄×××听到大炮声后，便跑到地主家去说：“爷们，你的东西我不给你放着啦，给你吧。”三、个别地主被遗漏。如二区王庄即有四户地主未改变成份，五区一户大地主漏了网。此外尚有干部贱购果实及损害中农等问题。该县全体干部现正全力深入群众艰苦工作，决心使群众在经济上政治上真正翻透身。此外，企之检查中，亦发现类似问题不少。
