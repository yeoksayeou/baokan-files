Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 7th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Rangoon: Burmese democrats have expressed dissatisfaction after the Burmese delegation, headed by Aung San, reached an agreement with the British government in London regarding the future of Burma. Saw San Htun, Minister of Transportation in the Governor's Executive Council, announced on the 6th that he would resign and lead his forces to crush the agreement with Britain in order to achieve genuine independence for Burma. Saw San Htun also stated that U Ba Swe, Minister of National Planning and Education, also intends to resign. Saw San Htun is now seeking support from the Communist Party and its delegation to move against Aung San's government. When the Burmese delegation was in London last time, U Ba Swe, leader of the Socialist Party, and U Saw opposed reaching an agreement with the British side, because the agreement did not specify a date for Burmese independence, and the so-called frontier provinces, accounting for one-thousandth of Burma, were designated outside Burmese territory.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 3rd: London dispatch: British-Burmese negotiations have ended, and the Burmese delegation left Britain on the 1st to return home. Before leaving, Aung San, the head of the delegation, said that both Britain and Burma had reached an agreement on all issues except the date of Burmese independence and the extent of its territory. The date of Burmese independence will be decided by the Burmese people. The Constituent Assembly will be convened in May, and the constitution will be completed in October. The Constituent Assembly will decide whether Burma will join the British Empire.

    【新华社延安七日电】据美联社仰光讯：以安山为首之缅甸代表团，在伦敦与英政府成立关于缅甸未来之协议后，缅甸民主人士已纷表不满。总督行政会议中之运输部长沙生，于六日宣布他将辞职，而率其部队致力于粉碎与英国的协议，而求得缅甸的真正独立。沙氏并称：国家计划及教育部长宇素亦拟辞职。沙氏现征求共产党及其代表团的支援，以移向妥山的政府。前次缅甸代表团在伦敦时，团员中之社会党领袖宇巴辛及宇素在反对与英方成立协定，因协定中关于缅甸独立日期既未确定，且占全缅甸为一千的所谓边疆诸省乃规定在缅甸领土之外。
