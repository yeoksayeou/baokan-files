Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to a reader's letter published in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on January 13th, the rampant banditry in the western suburbs of Shanghai in the past month is unprecedented in the past ten years. It is rumored that the bandits have more than eighty accomplices, divided into several teams. Each team of seventeen or eighteen people robs along different routes, with weapons such as ten-wheeled trucks, light machine guns, automatic rifles, Mauser pistols, and rifles. Residents west of Zhongshan North Road cannot sleep peacefully day or night, and more than a dozen families were robbed the month before.
