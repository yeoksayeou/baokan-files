Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Officers below the brigade level of the Chiang army's 51st Division, who laid down their arms in the Lunan Campaign, spent the Spring Festival happily in a certain place. Division Commander Zhou Yuying, Deputy Division Commander Han Shiru, Chief of Staff Li Xianzhong, Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Mingzhen, 113th Brigade Commander Li Yutang, Deputy Brigade Commander Cui Huisheng, and others, after drinking, gathered around the stove and chatted casually. The topic invariably focused on the tragic experiences of the Northeast Army under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of eliminating dissidents over the past decade. Deputy Division Commander Han Shiru lamented, "The 51st Division has a history of several decades. It participated in the Sino-Japanese War during the Qing Dynasty. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the entire division had twelve regiments, but Chiang Kai-shek only ordered us to fight and did not provide reinforcements, so we became smaller and smaller." Everyone was immersed in painful memories. Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Mingzhen spoke of leaving his hometown in tears when the Japanese invaders dispatched troops to Shenyang under Chiang Kai-shek's non-resistance order, and then spoke of the Xi'an Incident, saying, "At that time, our Northeast Army had six armies, including the 49th, 51st, 53rd, and 67th, and fifteen divisions, as well as the 3rd Cavalry Division, the 6th and 8th Artillery Regiments, and armored and communications battalions. I never thought we would end up like this today. We were really fooled by Chiang Kai-shek." These former Northeast Army generals couldn't help but think of their leader, General Zhang Xueliang: "I wonder how Young Marshal Zhang is doing now?" Everyone asked the reporter, inquiring about General Zhang's current situation. "Over there, the Kuomintang's Military Statistics Bureau especially prevents us from knowing, and we dare not inquire." When they heard that General Zhang was still imprisoned, they were all filled with indignation. The topic turned to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial policies. Division Commander Zhou Yuying said painfully, "This is letting the tiger out the front door and letting the wolf in the back door."

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th: General Chen Yi received five Chiang army generals above the brigade level of the 51st Division who laid down their arms in the Zaozhuang Campaign on the evening of the 2nd. They were Division Commander Zhou Yuying, Deputy Division Commander Han Shiru, Chief of Staff Li Xianzhong, 113th Brigade Commander Li Yutang, and 114th Brigade Commander Li Buqing. What Commander Chen said, "I hope that through this meeting, you can understand the truth of our struggle for peace and democracy and see through Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and traitorous conspiracy," aroused enthusiastic resonance. They all said with emotion, "We are a unit without backers. We can only move forward, otherwise we will be held accountable. Civil war is not the way out, so when we received the letters from Commander Chen and Commander Su, we unanimously agreed to lay down our arms."

    东北军五十一师官佐放下武器后
    回忆十几年来悲惨遭遇
    痛恨上了蒋介石的大当
    陈毅将军接见该师师长周毓英等
    【新华社山东四日电】鲁南战役中先后放下武器之蒋军五十一师旅以下官佐在某地欢度新春，师长周毓英、副师长韩世儒、参谋长李献中、副参谋长张铭振、一一三旅旅长李玉堂、副旅长崔慧生等多人，酒后围炉漫谈，话题不约而同的集中到十几年来东北军在蒋介石消灭异己政策下的悲惨遭遇。韩世儒副师长感叹的说：“五十一师已有几十年的历史，满清时代曾参加过甲午之战，抗战期间全师有十二个团，但蒋介石只命令打，不给补充，就越打越少了。“大家浸入沉痛的回忆里。张铭振副参谋长从日寇出兵沈阳，在蒋介石不抵抗命令下挥泪离乡，讲到双十二事变，说：“那时我们东北军还有四九、五一、五三、六七等六个军、十五个师，还有骑三师、炮六、八团，以及装甲通讯大队等，想不到有今天的结局，真是上了蒋介石的大当了。”这几位原来东北军的将领们，不由想起他们的领袖张学良将军：“张少帅现在不知怎样了？”大家齐问记者，询问张将军的现况。“在那边，国民党军统局特别是不让我们知道的，我们也不敢打听。”当他们听到张将军依然被囚禁时，都愤慨万分，话题转到蒋介石卖国独裁政策，周毓英师长沉痛地说：“这是前门出虎后门进狼。”
    【新华社山东五日电】陈毅将军于二日晚接见枣庄战役放下武器之蒋军五十一师旅以上将官，师长周毓英、副师长韩世儒、参谋长李献中、一一三旅旅长李玉堂、一一四旅旅长李步青等五人，他们对陈军长所说“希望经过此次见面，诸位能明了此间争取和平民主的真象，看穿蒋介石独裁卖国的阴谋”，引起热烈共鸣，一致感慨地说：“我们是没有靠山的部队，只有前进，否则即要问罪。内战不是出路，所以当接获陈军长、粟司令手信即一致同意放下武器。”
