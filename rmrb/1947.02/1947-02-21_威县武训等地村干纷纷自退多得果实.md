(Reported from Jinnan on the 19th by our newspaper) After the mass movement in Pancun, Wuyi County, last year, many village cadres and activists privately bought and sold the fruits of struggle, enriching themselves, which caused extreme dissatisfaction among the masses. Recently, responding to the leadership's call to return the excess gains, the cadres in the village, after review and introspection, have been voluntarily returning the excess gains. Zhao Bingchen, the head of the militia, was the first to report: "I and twelve village cadres privately sold five large trees, obtained firewood, and sold five mu of land obtained from the fruit of struggle when I was ill, without discussing it with everyone. This is all wrong, let everyone discuss and decide how to handle it." Wang Rushan, the representative of the Farmers' Association, said: "I, Wang Laopei, and Wang Laotong, privately sold four large beams, buying them cheap and selling them dear, earning 1,200 yuan. I am willing to give it all back." The cadres all reported their corruption or excess gains. After group discussions, it was believed that Zhao Bingchen truly sold land due to illness and was very honest. He had made many contributions to everyone, and he was elected as a member of the Farmers' Association for the emancipation of the peasants. Some returned the gains appropriately at the assessed price, and for a few poor people, after they honestly admitted their mistakes, they were no longer persuaded to return the gains. The discussions and resolutions by the masses were all very fair. Wuxun Yuanzhuang has eighty households and more than three hundred people. During the mass movement last spring, seven landlord households were struggled against, and ninety-two mu of land and more than 380,000 yuan were obtained, but the masses were still not fully mobilized, and the work was stagnant. After the cadres conducted an in-depth review, it was discovered that Qiao Zhongkui, the head of the Farmers' Association, managed the village finances, distributed too much of the gains, and, together with the head of the militia, monopolized a millstone and a large cow. The masses reflected: "Even if we pick someone at random in the village to be the head of the Farmers' Association, they would be better than Qiao Zhongkui." After understanding the situation, he was educated to admit his mistakes to the masses and return all the excess gains, which satisfied the masses greatly, and the work in the village has become active again.

　　威县武训等地村干纷纷自退多得果实
    【本报冀南十九日电】威县潘村去年群运大动后，不少村干和积极分子私买私卖斗争果实，从中自肥，群众极端不满。近该村干部响应领导上提出的退出多分果实号召，经过检讨反省，干部纷纷退出多分果实。自卫队长赵丙辰首先自报说：“我和十二个村干私卖五棵大树，有了柴烧，害病时候把分的果实地卖了五亩，都没给大家商量，这都不对，大家讨论处理。”农会代表王如山说：“我和王老配、王老同，私把四架大梁卖了。贱买贵卖，赚洋一千二百元，情愿拿出来”。各干部纷纷自报贪污或多得果实，经小组讨论，认为赵丙辰真是因病卖地，坦白的很实在，他对大家有很多功劳，选让他当农会翻身委员。有些适当按价退出，有个别穷苦的，坦白认错不再劝他退，群众讨论中都处理得很公道。武训袁庄有八十户人家，三百多口人，去春群运中，斗了七户地主，获得九十二亩土地，三十八万余元，但群众仍没充分发动，工作死气沉沉。经过干部深入检查，发现农会长乔仲奎管理村财政，多分了果实，并和自卫队长独占一盘轧车和一头大牛，群众反映：“在村里闭着眼摸一个人当农会长也比乔仲奎强。”了解情况后，教育他向群众承认错误，并把多得果实全部退出，群众很满意，该村工作已经活跃起来。
