Taihang Paper Mill
Saves Tools and Achieves Increased Production
[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 25th] The Taihang Paper Mill and its various branches have recently launched an increase production and meritorious service movement, fully supporting the front lines. All employees have unanimously participated in the production competition, establishing a production and savings plan from "February 7th" to "August 1st": it is estimated that 90,000 yuan in wages can be donated monthly to comfort the front lines. The production plan for banknotes will increase production by 19% per worker, and for printing and civilian paper, production will increase by 8% per worker. The quality must be: no bubbles, consistent thickness, no lumps, and every sheet must be usable. It is estimated that more than 20,000 catties of raw materials can be saved, which can save about 2.6 million yuan at market prices. Efforts should be made to save tools, such as extending the use of a paper hanger from three months to four months, and brushes from four and a half months to six months. Linen sheets will be extended from six months to seven months. The cost of paper should be reduced by 11% compared to the current price, achieving high quality and low prices. To ensure the successful completion of the plan, a movement to respect teachers, love apprentices, and study technology is now underway.
