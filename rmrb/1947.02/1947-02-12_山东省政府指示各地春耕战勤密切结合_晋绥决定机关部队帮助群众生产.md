Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. “This year's spring ploughing must be closely integrated with supporting the self-defense war, vigorously supporting the front line without delaying production.” This is the central point of the Shandong Liberated Area Provincial Government's spring ploughing work instructions. The instructions further put forward the following key points: 1. Production work should be combined with land reform. Some newly liberated areas have not completed land reform and should complete it before spring ploughing, and immediately conduct education on developing production and getting rich, investing the fruits of struggle into production. 2. Universally organize mutual aid labor, absorbing men, women, old, and young to participate in production, and pay special attention to the specific organization of women to participate in agricultural production. 3. Help the militia and civilian laborers who go to the front to cultivate the land, but keep good records of labor and accounts. Serving on the front line is calculated as one and a half workdays, and serving in the rear is calculated as one workday, which can be offset against the work accounts of the civilian labor teams. 4. Organize mutual aid labor with cattle and manpower, regulate draft cattle, and reward cattle-raising households to solve the problem of animal power shortages. 5. During the spring ploughing period, except for those necessary for the war, general conscription is prohibited. Government organs and troops should use their own manpower and animal power to help the people cultivate the land, and should not only focus on their own production and put helping the masses with production in a secondary position.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. Government organs and troops in the Jin-Northwest Liberated Area have decided that this year's production will focus on helping the masses, so that the masses in the new areas can quickly recover from bankruptcy. From now on, every time they arrive in a village, they will cooperate with the local farmers' association to help poor military families and farmers cultivate the land, and regard the achievements of helping as the production task of their unit, planning to deliver ten loads of manure and reclaim two mu of wasteland per person, and work ten days for summer weeding and autumn harvesting.

    山东省政府指示各地春耕战勤密切结合
    晋绥决定机关部队帮助群众生产
    【新华社山东七日电】“今年春耕必须与支援自卫战争密切结合，大力支援前线又要不误生产”。这是山东解放区省政府的春耕工作指示的中心。该指示继提出以下几个要点：一、生产工作应与土地改革结合，部分新解放区未完成土地改革，应在春耕前突击完成，并立即进行生产发家教育，以斗争果实投入生产。二、普遍组织变工，吸收男女老幼一齐参加生产，尤应注意具体组织妇女参加农业生产。三、帮助上前线的民兵民夫耕地，但要好好计工算帐，前线服务一天作一个半工计算，后方服务一天作一工计算，与民工组的工帐可以互相抵偿。四、组织牛力与人力变工，调剂耕牛，奖励养牛户以解决畜力困难。五、春耕期间除因战争必须者外，一般禁止支差，机关部队应以自己的人力、畜力帮助人民耕地，不应只顾自己生产而把帮助民众生产放在次要地位。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋西北解放区各机关部队，决定今年生产以帮助群众为主，使新区群众由破产状态迅速恢复。他们今后每到一村，即协同当地农会帮助贫苦军属农民耕作，将帮助成绩作为本单位生产任务，计划每人送粪十担开荒二亩，夏锄秋收十个工。
