　　Four Foreign Ministers' Deputies Meeting
　　Progress in Discussions on German and Austrian Issues
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: London dispatch: The Foreign Ministers' Deputies Meeting has made recent progress after being convened for nearly a month. On the 12th, when the procedure for the German peace treaty was discussed, Soviet representative Gusev expressed willingness to compromise. The Soviet Union originally advocated that the four powers should bear the primary responsibility for formulating the German peace treaty, but now it agreed to the American proposal to establish a small advisory committee of countries for consultation. The Deputies Meeting reached an agreement in principle on the 8th that the four-power occupation of Austria would end when the Austrian peace treaty came into effect. The authorities would also withdraw the Allied forces stationed in Austria within ninety days after the treaty came into effect.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Berlin dispatch: The Allied commanders in Germany agreed yesterday to submit a joint report on German control work to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held on the 10th of next month.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Berlin dispatch: According to a report released by the American military government in Germany on the 9th, the four-power occupation authorities in Germany have suspended the handling of certain major issues pending the outcome of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.
