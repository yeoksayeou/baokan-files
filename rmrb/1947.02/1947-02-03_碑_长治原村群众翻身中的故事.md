The Stele
A Story of the Emancipation of the Masses in Yuancun, Changzhi
Yecao

In Yuancun, Changzhi, there is a stone stele, more than six feet tall, inscribed on both sides, twice; it used to stand in the main temple, now it stands in a newly built pavilion by the pond; in the past, the "outsiders" would glare at it with envy, wanting to smash it into dust; even the "locals" said that erecting this stele was too much of a bullying act against the "outsiders." Now, both "outsiders" and "locals" have become fond of the stele, and when they talk about emancipation, they naturally mention this stele. This stele has become a symbol of the emancipation of the people of Yuancun.

Yuancun, like some villages on the Shanxi border, has "locals" and "outsiders." The "outsiders" are mostly from Linxian, and they came the earliest. In the old days, "things are expensive away from home, and people are cheap away from home." The "outsiders" in the village were subjected to more levies, and even if the "locals" lost a hundred cases, they would still lose. These were "naturally" "normal" things.

However, once, Li Wanxing, the head of the village association, heard a geomancer say that if a stage was built outside the temple (there was already a stage in the temple), his family would become even richer and accumulate more silver dollars. Li Wanxing, together with the village chief Li Congyi, his cousin, colluded and decided to build the stage. When spending "voluntary contributions" at the temple, the head of the association would hold the figures in his sleeve, dictating how much each person should contribute, and no one could escape. Needless to say, the "caohui" (ash people - a derogatory term for Henan people) were exploited again. However, this time the "caohui" were unwilling to suffer in silence and complained to the county about the head of the association and the village chief; as a result, they did not win the lawsuit, but offended the head of the association and the village chief even more.

Another time, the "outsiders" unceremoniously elected a Linxian native as the deputy village chief. Li Congyi colluded with the "district" and said that this Linxian native did not have enough property and was not qualified to be the deputy village chief. As a result, he did not become the deputy village chief, but further angered the head of the association and the village chiefs. They said: These "caohui" are really "wild," daring to disobey the "law," they are really going to "rebel," we must teach them a lesson!

Therefore, the big landlords fabricated a crime, saying that the Linxian people were forming factions and disrupting the "election"; then they created a stream of rumors: "The Linxian people are coming in large numbers, raising the prices of property!" "The Linxian people sell Jindan (a kind of drug), act as bandits, and ruin our village!" "There are no good people from Linxian, they cannot be allowed to join the association!" The landlords used this fabricated contradiction between locals and outsiders to consolidate their rule and oppression.

In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), Yan Xishan, that old fellow, started "preventing communism," pushing this feudal oppression to its peak. Li Congyi, Yuan Wenbin, Li Wanxing and their gang of village chiefs and deputies took the opportunity to erect this stele. The stele stated that most of the Linxian people were "bad eggs," selling and consuming Jindan opium, running gambling dens, and acting as bandits, disrupting "social order." Following the orders of Commander-in-Chief Yan to reorganize village administration, it was stipulated that: "Any person from another county who wants to register as a resident must have five guarantors before being allowed to enter...…" Villagers selling real estate and land must first notify the "locals," and only if the "locals" do not buy it, can the "outsiders" buy it...….

These were explicit regulations. Other things like: registering as a resident required finding guarantors and paying five more shi (a unit of dry measure) of grain to join the association, "outsiders" could not be village chiefs, deputy village chiefs, Lilzhang (neighborhood heads)...etc., were enforced by the "village chiefs" until after the War of Resistance.

Changzhi was liberated, and the flames of emancipation spread throughout the mountainous countryside. The masses of Yuancun began to struggle through accusations. After overthrowing the evil landlords such as Li Congyi, the hatred of the emancipated peasants immediately focused on this stele. "The time has come, it should have been overthrown long ago!" The local poor people also spoke up, Li Huaibao said: "What is the difference between 'locals' and 'outsiders,' aren't the poor the same!? In the past, the village chiefs and deputy village chiefs were always those few rich people! We never got to eat fried cakes or pulled noodles, but we were the ones who provided grain, paid taxes, did errands, and ran around!" Everyone, regardless of whether a meeting was called or not, rushed out of the meeting place and ran to the main temple. In a flash, iron ropes were tied around the stele, and levers were pried at the base of the stele. With a "bang," the stele was knocked down, and everyone in the courtyard felt much lighter. An old man with wrinkles and white hair smiled and said: "Even if I have to endure, I can see this stele being overthrown!"

The stele did not break, and people shouted in confusion: "Didn't break, it can be used as a茅梁石 ba!" (茅梁石 - the long stone steps in a toilet to step on), "Pave the road with it, let big and small carts crush it, so that it will never be able to turn over for ten thousand generations."

The emancipated people of Yuancun did not forget the people who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan. They erased the words that slandered the people, inscribed the names of the martyred heroes, and this fallen stele was re-erected by the hands of the people, becoming a monument to commemorate the War of Resistance and emancipation. It exposed the criminal acts of Guo Ruling and Li Xinghua, national special agents, colluding with the puppet district chief to kill Guo Hubao, the deputy secretary of our district peasant association.

The stele was still carved by stonemason Fu Shuiquan. While carving, he told people: "I am from Linxian, but those bad eggs made me carve words prohibiting Linxian people from joining the association; the wages for carving the stele were also used by Li Wanxing to pay interest, and I didn't get a penny; today, we are emancipated, even if I don't get paid, I will carve!"

The gap between "locals" and "outsiders" was also filled by the masses during the emancipation movement. No one calls anyone "caohui" anymore. The village cadres are elected by the people of Yuancun themselves, with both "locals" and "outsiders." Everyone respects each other and is as united as a family. Who led the filling of this gap and the transformation of this stele? Farmer Guo Erhe wrote these lines on his wall:

"The Communist Party leads well;
Clearer than water,
Brighter than a mirror,
United like steel."

The six-foot-high stone stele stands proudly in the newly built pavilion next to the pond, as if announcing to passers-by: "The evil feudal rule has been destroyed, and victory finally belongs to the people!"

    长治原村群众翻身中的故事
    野草
    长治原村有一通六尺多高的石碑，前后刻过两次；从前竖在大庙里，现在竖在池边新盖的碑亭里；从前“外来户”瞧着它就眼红，只想一下打它个碎末末烂；就是“本地人”也说竖这碑太欺负“外来户”了。现在不管“外来户”、“本地人”都对碑亲热起来，他们说起翻身，就自自然然说到这碑上来。这通碑已经成为原村人民翻身的标志了。
    ×  ×  ×
    原村也和山西边境有些村庄一样，有“本地人”，也有“外来户”。“外来户”以林县人为最多，来的也最早。过去的世道，“物离乡贵，人离乡贱”，“外来户”在村里多出摊派，和“本地人”打官司百理也是输。这些，原也是“理所当然”的“平常”事。
    可是有一次，社里的维首李万兴听风鉴先生说，庙外再盖上戏台（庙里已有戏台了），他家就会更富，就能积攒更多大元宝。（山里的地主顶喜欢埋存元宝。）万兴就和村长李从义，他的堂兄弟捏弄通了，要盖戏台。在庙上花“心愿”布施，维首在袖筒揣着码子，叫谁出多少，一个也出不了。不消说又狠狠的捉弄了一下“草灰”。（按：为山西地主对河南人的讥讽之称）谁料这次“草灰”们偏偏不愿再吃哑吧亏，就向县里告了维首和村长一状；结果官司没打胜，却把维首和村长等得罪痛了。
    又一次是这村副，“外来户”不客气地选了个林县人当村副。李从义和“区”上捏弄通了，说这个林县人财产不够，没有资格当村副，结果村副没当上，反更加惹恼了维首和村长副们。他们说：这些“草灰”真“野”，竟敢不服“王法”，真要起“反”了，总得给他们个利害尝尝！
    于是，大地主们就捏造了个罪名，说林县人结党捣乱“选举”；随后又造出一股一股的谣言：“林县人来多了，把产业都买贵啦！”“林县人卖金丹，当响马，把咱村闹坏啦！”“林县上来的没有好人，不能叫他进社！”地主们就利用这种强造出来的本地和外来的矛盾，巩固了他们的统治和压迫。
    民国二十四年，阎锡山这老家伙闹起“防共”来，就把这种封建压迫推倒顶点。李从义、袁文彬、李万兴这伙维首村长副们，就趁机立了这通碑。在碑上刻着林县人大部分是“坏蛋”、贩卖吸食金丹鸦片、开赌博、走响马，扰乱“社会治安”。奉阎总司令命令整理村政，所以规定：“凡外县人入籍者，非有五家保人不准入………”村人卖房产土地，先通知“本地人”，“本地人”不买，才准“外来户”买………。
    这是明文规定着的，其余像：入籍的找上保人还得再出上五石谷才能入社，“外来户”不能当村长副，闾长……等等，直到抗战后还为“村长们”执行着。
    ×  ×  ×
    长治解放了，翻身的烈火遍燃了山地的农村。原村群众开始诉苦斗争。在斗倒了李从义等恶霸地主后，翻身农民的仇恨立刻集中到这通碑上。“到时候啦，早就该斗倒它！”本地的穷人也说话了，李怀保说：“分啥‘本地人’、‘外来户’，穷人还不是一样！？过去当村长村副的，翻过来，掉过去还不是那几个有钱人！？吃烙饼拉面轮不上咱，出粮、上款、支差、跑腿，才该咱！”大家也不管开会不开会，一涌出了会场，跑到大庙里，说话间铁绳套在碑上，杠子跷在碑脚，“砰”的一声，碑裁倒了，满庙院人的身上轻快了许多。一个满脸皱纹白发苍苍的老汉笑着说：“熬我也能见斗倒这通碑！”
    碑没有摔断，人们七嘴八舌乱嚷着：“没跌破做了茅梁石吧！”（厕所里踏脚的长石条），“铺了路，大车小辆压住它，叫它万辈也翻不了身”。
    翻了身的原村人民，并没有忘记抗日战争中牺牲了的人们。他们磨去了诬蔑人民的字句，刻上了殉难烈士的英名，这通倒了的碑重新由人民的手扶起来，成为纪念抗战和翻身的碑了。它揭露着国特郭如陵、李兴华等勾结伪区长共同杀害我区农会副秘书郭虎保的罪恶事实。
    ×  ×  ×
    碑还是石匠傅水泉刻的。他一边刻着，一边给人们讲：“咱是林县人，那些坏蛋们却叫我刻上不许林县人进社的字；刻碑的工钱也给李万兴顶了利钱，一个也没落到手；今朝翻身啦，不给工钱我也要刻！”
    “本地人”和“外来户”中间鸿沟也在翻身运动中被群众填平了。再听不见有人叫“草灰”了。村干部是原村人民自己选出来的，有“本地人”，也有“外来户”。大家互相尊重，团结得像一家人一样。什么人领导着填平了这道沟，改换了这通碑呢？农民郭二合在他的墙上写着这么几行字：
    “共产党领导好；
    清于水，
    明于镜，
    团结如钢铁。”

    六尺高的大石碑，傲然地立在池子旁边新建的碑亭里，它仿佛向过路的人们宣布着：“罪恶的封建统治已经摧毁，胜利终于是人民的！”
