(Reported by our newspaper from Zuoquan) The mass emancipation movement in the old district of Zuoquan began in early December last year. After more than 50 days of vigorous mobilization, land reform has been basically completed. According to statistics from 132 natural villages in six districts (including one new district), more than 300 households of local bullies and landlords were overthrown in this struggle, more than 100 households of entrepreneurial landlords were struggled against, the "tails" of 490 households of feudal rich peasants were cut off, and peasants rationally recovered more than 28,000 mu of land, more than 17,000 rooms, more than 1,700 head of livestock, more than 14,000 sheep, more than 14 million yuan in silver dollars (including more than 56,000 silver dollars, 44 yuanbao ingots (worth more than 1,600 taels)), more than 20,000 pieces of clothing, more than 10,000 shi of grain, and more than 43,000 other utensils from the landlords. These villages have all satisfied the economic demands of the peasants and achieved thorough emancipation. In addition, more than 30 poor villages, under the slogan of "both poor and rich villages should be emancipated," carried out fraternal assistance between villages and also obtained considerable results, eliminating extreme poverty. According to statistics from six districts: more than 1,300 households in extreme poverty were eliminated, with an average of 5.5 mu of land per person; 86 households became poor peasants; more than 1,000 households rose to become middle peasants; and more than 200 households became prosperous middle peasants. A total of more than 600 households of honorably retired soldiers rose to become middle peasants in more than 400 households and prosperous middle peasants in more than 100 households, with an average of 2.91 mu of land per person. More than 4,000 households of poor and hired peasants obtained an average of more than three mu of land per person, and most of them rose to become middle peasants. In addition, more than 7,000 households of middle peasants, prosperous middle peasants, and small merchants have also received their due fruits. The emancipated peasants are unprecedentedly excited, saying one after another: "We poor people have finally made it through. If we don't farm well next year and don't get rich, we'll be letting down our Chairman Mao." The emancipated peasants of Zhuning happily wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to wish him a happy New Year, hoping that Chairman Mao would live for ten thousand years. Some honest peasants who were unwilling to perform corvée labor in the past now say after being emancipated: "It would be a pleasure to perform corvée labor and be a militiaman even during the New Year." Some village militiamen practiced martial arts after eating dumplings on New Year's Day. The emancipated masses in various villages are enthusiastically celebrating, dressing up in flower operas and singing about emancipation.

The most important experiences in obtaining the above achievements are the following three points: First, the county, district, and village cadres and activists first conducted in-depth and detailed discussions on the land policy through various meetings, realized the policy of thoroughly eliminating feudalism and realizing land to the tillers, broke the complacency and confused ideas such as "no problem" and "almost there," and truly accepted this great historical task ideologically, and let go to mobilize the masses. Second, they established a clear class viewpoint, delineated class boundaries, grasped the spirit that all the peasants in the world are one family, and under the slogan of "our own people discuss and handle things, and thoroughly settle accounts with the local bullies and landlords," solved the internal problems of the peasants, eliminated the concerns of the middle peasants about being "cut like leeks," and created unprecedented unity among the peasants. Third, a large number of district and village cadres have learned new ideological leadership and mass line methods, made extensive use of activists, promoted the movement, and used methods of visiting the suffering, digging up the roots of poverty, and using suffering to lead suffering to mobilize backward peasants.

At present, county and district cadres are gathering in the county to hold a meeting to discuss issues such as continuing to deepen and fully mobilize the backward and rectify the relationship between cadres and the masses, so as to unite internally to completely destroy the feudal economic and political rule.

    左权老区实现土地改革
    万余户农民翻透身
    现正继续深入发动落后调整干群关系
    【本报左权讯】左权老区的群众翻身运动，从去年十二月初开始，经过五十多天的猛烈发动，基本上完成了土地改革。根据六个区（内有一个新区）一百三十二个自然村的统计，此次翻身斗争中共斗倒了三百余户恶霸地主，和一百余户经营地主，割了四百九十户封建富农尾巴，农民合理的向地主收回土地二万八千余亩，房屋一万七千多间，牲畜一千七百余头，羊一万四千余只，大洋一千四百余万元，内有银元五万六千余元，元宝四十四个（折一千六百余两），衣服二万余件，粮食一万多石，其他用具四万三千余件，这些村都满足了农民的经济要求，作到了翻透身。另有三十多个穷村，在“穷村富村都翻身”的口号下，村与村进行了友爱帮助，也得到了不少果实，消灭了赤贫。据六个区统计：赤贫一千三百余户消灭，每人平均土地五亩五分，变为贫农的八十六户，上升为中农的一千余户，富裕中农的二百余户。荣退军人共六百余户，升为中农的四百余户，富裕中农一百余户，每人平均土地二亩九分一。贫雇农四千余户，每人平均得地三亩以上，大部升为中农。另外七千余户中农富裕中农及小商人，也都得到了应得的果实。翻身农民空前兴奋，纷纷说：“咱这伙穷人可算是熬出来啦。明年如种不好地，发不了财，就对不住咱毛主席哩。”竹宁翻身农民高兴的给毛主席写信拜年，盼毛主席活上万万岁。还有的老实农民过去不愿支差，这次翻了身都说：“就叫咱过大年去支差当民夫也痛快”。有的村民兵在过大年的那天吃过了扁食，便进行练武。各村翻身群众都在轰轰烈烈的闹娱乐，扮花戏歌唱翻身。
    以上成绩的获得，最主要的经验有以下三点：第一首先是县区村干部和积极分子，经过各种会议对土地政策进行了深刻细致的讨论，认识了彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田的方针，打破了“没问题”、“差不多”等自满情绪和糊涂观念，真正在思想上接受了这一伟大历史任务，放手发动了群众。第二树立了明确的阶级观点，划分了阶级界限，掌握了天下农民是一家的精神，在“自己人商议办，恶霸地主彻底算”的口号下，解决了农民内部问题，消除了中农的割韭菜顾虑，造成了农民内部的空前团结。第三大量区村干部，都学会了新的思想领导和群众路线，大量的运用了积极分子，推进了运动，运用了访痛苦、挖穷根、以苦引苦的诉苦办法，发动了落后农民。
    目前县区干部正集县开会，讨论继续深入充分发动落后和整顿干部与群众关系等问题，以团结内部达到彻底摧毁封建经济政治统治。（左权联合办公室）
