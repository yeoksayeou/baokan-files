Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 17th: Residents along the Yellow River in Guangrao, Lijin, Putai, and Kenli (new county northeast of Lijin) counties in the Bohai region are actively engaged in flood control and self-help. They have already concentrated 2.5 million bricks and 1.3 million catties of sorghum at five dangerous sections, including Dayu Zhang, Daoxu, Wang Wangzhuang, Mawan, and Dongjiazhuang, with hundreds of vehicles transporting materials daily. Between Kenli and Mawan, a distance of over 150 li, more than 30,000 catties of brambles have been transported. In the freezing weather, a dangerous section of dike three li long in Wang Wangzhuang has been completed. The masses are guarding the dikes day and night with guns, strictly preventing sabotage by special agents.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th: During the Spring Festival, this reporter passed through some villages along the old course of the Yellow River in Kenli County and saw entire groups of residents pushing carts, carrying burdens, supporting the old and leading the young, migrating everywhere in the wind and snow, forming a tragic picture of refugees. Zhujiawu Village was originally the most lively market town. When this reporter passed through the village this time, every house was silently half-closed. Everyone that remained in the village wore gloomy expressions. Farmer Chang Zuoxi of Dongxingziyuan Village pleaded sadly with his grandfather, "Let's go quickly, Chiang Kai-shek has released the river water!" The old man said reluctantly, "This is our home built with several years of hard work. How can I bear to leave it?" In the lower reaches of Kenli alone, the number of people needing to be relocated accounts for 20 percent of the county's population. Where can they all be accommodated in such a hurry? For example, the residents who moved from Zhangjia Wuzi, a village of more than 100 households, have more than doubled the original number of households. Refugees who moved in earlier could still find a thatched hut, while those who moved in later had to pile grass into houses or dig holes in the ground to temporarily avoid the attacks of heavy snow and cold winds. The cries of children freezing and starving in the middle of the night were unbearable. In previous years, Fuxing Village, the village of labor model Zhang Furong, was a scene of joy during the Spring Festival. This year, the whole village painfully abandoned their warm homes and migrated, scattering in all directions, with only seven households remaining. On New Year's Eve, a dozen or so adults in the whole village sat together silently, spending the last day of the old year tragically.

　　渤海地区河民积极抢险自救
    黄河故道一片悲惨景象
    【新华社山东十七日电】渤海地区广饶、利津、蒲台、垦利（新县利津东北）等县沿黄河居民积极抢险自救。已于打鱼张、道旭、王旺庄、麻湾、董家庄等五处险工集中二百五十万块砖，一百三十万斤高粱，每天数百辆车辆从事运送。垦利至麻湾百五十余里间，现已运到荆条三万余斤，在冰天雪地中，王旺庄三里长的一段险工已竣工，群众昼夜提枪护堤，严防特务分子破坏。
    【新华社山东十九日电】记者于春节时路过垦利县沿黄河故道一些村庄，只见整批的居民推车挑担、扶老携幼，在风雪中四处迁移，形成一幅悲惨的流民图。朱家屋村原是最热闹的一个集场，当记者这次路过该村时，见家家柴门虚掩，全村寂然无声，剩下还没有迁移的人每一张面孔都是阴沉沉的。东杏子园村农民常左席悲求他的爷爷说：“快走吧，蒋介石把河水放下来了！”那老汉恋恋不舍地说：“这是俺们几年血汗建立起来的家呵，叫俺怎能舍得离开呢？”仅垦利下游需要迁移的即占全县人口百分之二十，仓促之间，那里都安插得下呢？譬如百多户的张家屋子迁来的居民，就比原来户数增加一倍以上，早移来一步的难民还可找到一间草房，晚一点移来的就只有堆草为屋、掘地作房，暂避大雪寒风的袭击。深夜孩子们冻饿的哭喊惨不忍闻，劳动模范张福儒的复兴村往年春节是一片欢乐，今年全村忍痛抛弃了自己温暖的家，迁移流散，现只留有七户。除夕深夜，全村十几个大人团坐在一起，默默无言，悲惨的渡过了这旧年的最后一天。
