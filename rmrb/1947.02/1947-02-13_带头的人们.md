    The call for production and thrift by Comrade Bo Yibo has been met with enthusiastic responses from many organizations. The Central Bureau, Military Region Political Department, Supply Department, Xinhua Bookstore, and others are taking the lead.

    In this movement, more emphasis should be placed on individual production within organizations. If individuals in organizations can contribute a certain amount of wealth to the public, it will be the best form of thrift. Therefore, in addition to tightening belts, each organization must organize production activities. This can strengthen our sense of labor, serve as a good form of learning, and greatly encourage the masses throughout the region to launch a large-scale production movement.

    To organize individual production within organizations, administrative leaders must pay attention and personally advocate and organize it. The most important thing is to launch a merit campaign, and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of all personnel. In the development of the merit campaign, both work and learning should be improved.

    The people who take the lead are opening up the way. We call on all places that have not yet taken action to immediately respond to Comrade Yibo's call and get moving.

    带头的人们
    薄一波同志生产节约的号召发出以后，许多机关热烈响应，中央局、军区政治部、供给部、新华书店等就是带头的人。
    在这个运动中，应当更强调机关个人生产。如果机关个人都能增加一定数量财富交公，这就成为最好的节约。因此，每个机关除了节衣缩食以外，必须把生产运动组织起来。这可使我们增强劳动观念，是一种很好的学习，而对于推动全区群众开展大生产运动，则是一种极好的鼓励。
    要把机关个人生产组织起来，行政负责同志必须关心注意，亲自倡导组织。最重要的是开展立功运动，发扬全体人员的积极性和创造性。在立功运动的开展中，把工作和学习同时提高一步。
    带头的人们正在开辟着道路。我们号召一切未动起来的地方，立即响应一波同志的号召，行动起来。
