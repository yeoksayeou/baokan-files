　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 17th, private banking circles believe that the Chiang government's "temporary easing measures" to deal with the financial and economic crisis are "adding fuel to the fire." They pointed out that the current price level was reached when the exchange rate of Chiang currency to US dollars rose to 18,000 and 20,000 yuan a week ago. Therefore, the new exchange rate of 12,000 yuan is lower than the actual exchange rate. They said: The authorities' order prohibiting the publication of any exchange rate other than the official exchange rate is an admission that the black market is also mixed in. The general public's unanimous opinion on the foreign exchange order is: "Simultaneous with the order, government officials here and abroad who own the majority of foreign currency have already disposed of their foreign exchange on the black market." Both Chinese and foreign sides in Shanghai strongly stated that restoring "wartime controls" is merely an empty gesture, because during the entire war of resistance against Japan, controls were a dead letter and exports were never implemented at all, nor will they be possible in the future. Ta Kung Pao also said: The plan to encourage exports only looks "pretty good" in the newspapers. It is also learned that on the 12th, rumors of a ban on private gold holdings were rampant in Shanghai. Wenhui Daily commented: "Gold 'nationalization' is bound to fail." It also strongly stated: "No one can predict when they will be submerged in this crisis," "The root of the current inflation lies in the insistence on civil war. If the battlefield is unsuccessful, it is accelerating the economic collapse. As a result, the economic crisis increases the unfavorable situation on the battlefield. Interacting and developing, it will definitely run counter to the warmongers' calculations, and foreign debt can no longer catch up with production. The people see more clearly that the warmongers use the magic of inflation to take the money for everyone's survival into their own hands, as a desperate gamble. In front of us, there are only two paths: peace means life, civil war means death."

　　上海舆论斥责蒋政府
    管制政府加速经济危机
    文汇报指出内战为通货膨胀的根源
    【新华社延安十八日电】据合众社上海十七日讯：私人银行界对蒋政府应付财政经济危机的“暂时缓和措施”的看法，这认为是“火上加油”。他们指出目前的物价水准，是在蒋币对美钞兑换率于一周前涨到一万八千元与两万元时达到的，因此新的一万二千元兑换率是较实际兑换率为低的，他们说：当局禁止发表官方汇率以外任何兑换率的命令，正是承认黑市也是混进去。一般平民对于兑换外币命令的一致意见是：“与命令同时，在此间与外国拥有多数外币的政府大人们，都已将他们的外汇在黑市中脱手。”上海中国人与外国人方面都力称：恢复“战时管制”，不过是空洞的姿态而已，因为在整个对日作战时期，管制本为一具空文，根本出口没有实行过，将来也不可能实行。大公报亦称：鼓励出口的计划，只有在报纸上看来“满漂亮”。另悉，十二日沪上盛传禁止黄金国有论，文汇报即评称：“黄金‘国有’必然失败。”并力称：“谁也不能预料在这危机的狂澜中，何时淹没”，“目前通货膨胀的根源，在于坚持内战，如果战场不得手，正加速了经济崩溃，结果又因经济危机的猛袭，增加了战场上的不利形势。相因相成，发展下去，一定和好战者的算盘背道而驰，已非外债所能赶上生产了。人民看得更清楚了，好战者用通货膨胀的魔术，把人人活命的钱，拿到自己手里，作孤注一掷。在眼前只有两条路：和平则生，内战则死。
