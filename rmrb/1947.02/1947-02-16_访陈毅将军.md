　　Interview with General Chen Yi
　　American Reporter Betty Graham
　　Yesterday, this reporter visited General Chen Yi at his headquarters. The General told this reporter that two-thirds of the equipment and weaponry used this time on the Yixian and Taierzhuang lines were captured in the Huaibei Campaign or the vicinity of Lanling last month.

　　In analyzing these two victories that enhanced the strength of the CCP forces, General Chen pointed out two main factors: the speed with which the Kuomintang troops laid down their weapons and the large number of prisoners who voluntarily joined the CCP forces.

　　He recalled that in the Huaibei Campaign, the 69th Division was wiped out in five days and nights. Among the 18,000 who surrendered, 4,000 immediately volunteered to join the CCP army, and most of the rest turned their guns around to fight; while the Lanling Campaign took only 41 hours to wipe out the 26th Division and its Rapid Column, which were stronger than the 69th Division. Among the 20,000 who surrendered, a large number immediately turned their guns around and pointed them at their former officers.

　　General Chen Yi pointed out that the eagerness of Kuomintang junior officers and soldiers to surrender and join the CCP forces proved the rapid growth of the Chinese democratic movement. He said, "To understand the current military developments, we must first recognize the widespread and strong democratic demands in the Kuomintang troops."

　　He continued: The nature of the current war is becoming increasingly clear. The soldiers seized by Chiang Kai-shek now recognize that this is a war against dictatorship. They increasingly resent Chiang's colonial policy—as manifested in the Sino-US Commercial Treaty and the continued stationing of US troops in China and the policy of "close cooperation" with the United States. Therefore, they all feel that this war has become a national war, a war for independence.

　　Regarding the strategic significance of the two victories, General Chen believes that these two battles were of a local counter-offensive nature, rather than the beginning of a full-scale counter-offensive. He believes that it was an aid to the Yan'an front, and he expects that Chiang will concentrate his forces to repair the strength of East China by drawing troops from other battlefields.

　　"A few more such battles will force Chiang to completely stop his offensive," General Chen added. "I think it is very likely that we will achieve a few more victories in the near future."

　　General Chen Yi does not foresee any difficulties in using the newly captured American equipment. Although his subordinates are not familiar with many weapons, he explained the problem by saying: "Our troops have basic scientific military training and can master new weapons. After three or four battles, we will become experts in using these weapons." The source of his confidence, as they say, is because every new weapon is developed on the principle of the old weapon. He used the example of how rocket launchers were developed from mortars to illustrate. He emphasized, "It would be a wrong perception to think that our troops are so militarily ignorant that they cannot use new weapons. In addition, many new soldiers who have turned from the Kuomintang troops are also helping us use these weapons."

　　When talking about the Kuomintang's propaganda that the CCP army must have Japanese or Soviet advisors to use mechanized equipment quickly and effectively, General Chen Yi angrily said: "Chiang Kai-shek said in his book 'China's Destiny' that the Chinese nation is superior to both the United States and the Soviet Union, but then he thought that without the help of Americans, Soviets, or Japanese, Chinese people would not be able to understand modern weapons at all, which is really ridiculous!"

　　General Chen's opinion is that the most useful newly captured weapons are howitzers, tanks, and electrical equipment. He said, "If Chiang wants to send some more, I am willing to give him a receipt." (January 9th)

　　访陈毅将军
    美记者  白蒂·葛兰恒
    昨日记者往访陈毅将军于其指挥部，将军告记者：此次在驿县、台儿庄一线所使用之装备兵器，三分之二系在上月内于淮北战役或兰陵附近战役中所缴获者。
    陈将军于分析这增强了中共部队实力的两次胜利时，他指出两个主要因素：国民党部队放下武器之迅速及俘虏们自愿参加中共部队之极大数量。
    他回忆在淮北战役五昼夜歼灭了六十九师，降服的一万八千人中四千人即时自愿参加了中共军队，其余的大部也跟踪掉转枪来；而兰陵战役只用了四十一小时，即歼灭了强于六十九师的二十六师及其快速纵队，在投降的两万人中，有极大部分立即掉转枪口，向着他们原先的长官们。
    陈毅将军指出：国民党中下级军官及士兵投降并参加中共部队之踊跃，证明了中国民主运动飞快的生长。他说：“了解目前军事发展，必首先认清国民党部队中普遍的强烈的民主要求。”
    他继又称：目前战争之性质，日趋明显，被蒋介石抓来的士兵现都已认出这是反对独裁的战争，他们日益痛恨蒋的殖民地政策——那表现在中美商约及美军继续驻华的与美国“亲密合作”的政策，因此他们都感到这个战争已成为民族的战争，成为争取独立的战争。
    关于两次胜利的战略意义，陈将军认为此两战役系局部反攻性质，而非全面反攻的开始，他认为是对延安前线的一个援助，他并预期蒋必将为集中力量修补华东之兵力而从其他战场抽调部队。
    “再有几个这样的战役，即将迫使蒋完全会停止其进攻。”陈将军补充道：“我想很可能在最近的将来，再取得几次胜利的。”
    陈毅将军预期对新缴美式装备之使用没有什么困难，虽然他的部下对于许多武器是并不熟悉的，他解释此问题时说：“我们的部队素有基本的科学的军事训练，便能掌握新的武器，经过三四次战役，我们就成为使用这些兵器的专家了。”他的这种信心的来源，正像他们所说，是因为每一种新武器都是在旧武器的原理上发展的。他以火箭炮如何由迫击炮发展而来，作为说明之举例。他加重语气说道：“如若认为我们的部队在军事上那样无知，以致于不能使用新武器，就是错误的认识。另外很多从国民党部队中掉转过来的新兵，也在帮助我们使用这些武器。”
    谈及国民党宣传中共军必是有日本或苏联顾问才能很快有效地使用机械化装备时，陈将军气愤的说道：“蒋介石在《中国之命运》一书中说中国民族是比美国或苏联都优秀的，而以后却又以为没有美国人或苏联人或日本人的帮助，中国人则一点也不能懂得现代兵器，这实在是可笑的！”
    陈将军的意见以为最有用的新缴获的武器是榴弹炮、坦克和电料器材，他说：“如蒋想再送一些来，我是愿意打收条给他的。”（一月九日）
