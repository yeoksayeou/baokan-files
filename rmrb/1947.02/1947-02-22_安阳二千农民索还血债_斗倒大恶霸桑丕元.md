[Our Newspaper, Taihang, 19th dispatch] Over two thousand farmers from fifteen villages, including Nanleikou in Anyang, jointly launched a struggle to demand blood debt payment from Sang Piyuan, a head of a traitor and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent, who colluded with the enemy and puppets to oppress the masses. Sang was from Nanleikou. During the famine in 1920, he organized the Qingdao sect to suppress the disaster victims' movement to borrow grain from landlords. In 1924, he instigated orders for each village to buy guns, forcing countless farmers into bankruptcy due to the purchase of guns. The Kuomintang government bestowed official titles on Sang, appointing him as the Commander-in-Chief of the "bandit" suppression in Anyang and Lin counties. His control expanded to seventy-two villages, with over 1,200 guns. Later, he was promoted to Senior Counselor of the Henan Provincial Government. According to statistics from fifteen villages, he buried or brutally murdered twenty-nine people. He once organized the "Green Seed Society," with Sang as the general manager, and branches in each village. When the autumn crops ripened, he detained the farmers, giving them only two meals of thin porridge a day. People often say, "Whether you harvest or not, you eat through the autumn." Under Sang Piyuan's rule, it turned into "the poor suffer for a year, and in the autumn they are guarded." The entire village of Nanleikou, with eighty livestock, had to carry coal for him twice a year for free. He also seized over eighty acres of land from the masses. In the winter of 1945, in order to coordinate with Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn attacks, he secretly formed the "Red Spear Society" and planned an uprising, which was suppressed by our democratic government. The people of Anyang gnash their teeth and hate Sang Piyuan to the bone. During the mass movement, the masses in the first, sixth, and seventh districts of the county all demanded to vent their grievances and settle accounts with the traitor Sang Piyuan. On the 2nd of this month, a joint struggle of over two thousand people from fifteen villages against Sang was organized. When the masses recounted that Sang had shot and killed Yuan Shiwu of Quanmen Village, and that Li Bingjun was starved to death by the "Green Seed Society," and that Guo Mucun from Anhe Village was buried alive, the whole audience was furious. An old woman from Guanjiazhuang, holding a stick, went to beat Sang Piyuan and said, "Today is not your world anymore." The slogan "A life for a life" immediately resonated throughout the audience. Finally, Sang Piyuan received his due punishment, and all his family property was used to repay the blood and sweat debts of the masses.
