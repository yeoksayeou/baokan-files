　　Soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek Army on the Ji-Lu-Yu Front Cease Fighting and Complain to Us

　　[Our Correspondent on the Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 15th] Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers who laid down their arms in the battles of Dingtao, Chengwu, and Shanxian, have successively complained to us, bitterly recounting how the Chiang Kai-shek army forced them into civil war, and the oppression their families suffered. Su Qingyi, a soldier in the artillery company of the 63rd Regiment of the 88th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, who was liberated in Shanxian, said: "He is from Nanchong County, Sichuan. He already had lung disease at home, but he couldn't escape conscription. After being conscripted into the army, his lung disease worsened due to overwork. His family was in difficult circumstances, and his fiancée had no choice but to remarry. His mother was old and sick, and the harvests were poor year after year, leaving them heavily in debt and unable to make a living. He repeatedly requested to be demobilized and return home, but the Chiang Kai-shek army refused. Xiong Wenjun, the warrant officer and special agent of the 1st Company of the 63rd Regiment of the 88th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, had been wounded in the head and abdomen twice, and suffered from lung and stomach diseases, making it impossible to eat, but his repeated requests to return home were also denied. He is from Wusheng, Sichuan. His elder brother was drafted and died in battle, his sister-in-law remarried, and then his younger brother was drafted again, and his current status is unknown. When his father went to Chengdu to sell eggs, he was also seized and forced to work as a cook, and died from exhaustion. He said mournfully and resentfully: "My family is ruined, and it's all because of old Chiang's oppression!"

　　冀鲁豫前线
    罢战蒋军向我诉苦
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十五日电】定陶、城武、单县战斗放下武器的蒋军官兵，纷纷向我诉苦，痛述蒋军逼其跳入内战，和家庭遭受欺压的情形。在单县解放过来的蒋军八八师六三团炮兵连战士苏庆义说：“他是四川南充县人，在家时就已患肺病，但也没逃脱。抓丁被抓到军队后，因过度辛劳，肺病越来越重。家中生活困难，他的未婚妻不得已而改嫁，母亲年迈多病，岁岁歉收，借贷很大无法为生。他曾一再要求复员回家，均被蒋军拒绝。蒋军八八师六三团一连准尉特务长熊文俊，头上及腹部曾两处负伤，并有肺病胃病，不能吃饭，但一再请求亦未能复员，回家。他是四川武胜人，他的哥哥被抽壮丁后战死，嫂子改嫁，随后他的弟弟又被抓丁，现在生死不明。他父亲往成都卖鸡蛋时，也被抓去当伙夫而累死。他凄凉而愤恨的说：“我落得人亡家破，都是老蒋逼的！”
