Model Village Cadres Who Serve the People

Wang Shengqing, Director of the Armed Committee of Xianwang Village, Fifth District of Huaxian County, Wang Xichen, Public Security Officer, and Wang Tonggen, Director of the Farmers' Association, are frugal in their daily work and actively lead the masses in turning over. When the enemy comes, they fight guerrillas. The masses call them models of "serving the people." The village's finances are open to the public, and spending is first discussed with the masses and then the accounts are published afterwards. During the land reform, they actively led the peasants to turn over, overthrowing the deceptive "bachelor associations" of the past, and everyone in the village received more than three mu of land. When distributing fruit, they only distributed the share they deserved and refused special rewards. They said, "This is everyone's strength, we few alone are not enough." When the enemy attacked Puxian County, they responded to the county's call and took up guns to join the guerrillas. Before leaving, the village held a joint meeting of citizen group leaders for a whole night. The masses and village cadres were reluctant to part, and said in unison, "Our models will definitely come back!"

　　为老百姓办事的
    模范村干
    滑县五区献王庄武委会主任王胜清、公安员王喜辰、农会主任王同根，平时办公俭省，积极领导群众翻身，敌人来就打游击，群众称为“为老百姓办事”模范。该村财政公开，花钱先经群众商量，事后公布账目。土地改革中，他们积极领导农民翻身，推翻过去欺人的“光棍会”，全村每人补到三亩以上。分配果实时，他们只分应得的分数，拒绝特别提奖。他们说：“这是大家力量，光俺几个也不中。”敌人打到濮县时，他们响应县里号召，扛起枪参加了游击队。临走，村里开了整整一夜公民组长联席会，群众村干部依依难舍，齐声说：“咱们的模范一定会回来！”
