    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th. Han Shide, who recently fled from Yaojiaqiao, Danyang County, in Jiangnan, to the Dongtai Liberated Area, said that the people of Jiangnan still fondly remember Commander Su Yu. When Division Commander Su (Su was then the commander of the First Division of the New Fourth Army) was ordered to lead his troops north two years ago, the people wept and tried to persuade them to stay. Later, when the "Central" Army arrived, ten strong men were conscripted from each village, four guns were collected and donated from each Bao, and five catties of rice per mu of land were donated each month. Han said, "My family of five farms seven mu of land, which was more than enough to live on, but we were so impoverished by the donations and taxes that we could not make a living." When the New Fourth Army was there, the people of Jiangnan only had to pay a small amount of public grain. The "Central" Army is truly a "disaster" army, with this donation and that tax. Local bullies and traitors became village and Bao chiefs, and all the young men were conscripted. They all said, "Su Yu, come and save us, our eyes are strained from waiting." Han Shide has now moved his family to the Liberated Area. The democratic government has given them great comfort and helped them settle down and resume production. Commander Su Yu once led the New Fourth Army in Jiangnan in bloody battles alongside the people to resist the Japanese. After the victory, in order to abide by the Double Tenth Agreement and strive for the realization of national peace and democracy, he reluctantly withdrew north.

    江南人民望穿了眼睛
    殷盼粟裕司令去解救
    【新华社华中十日电】据刚从江南丹阳县姚家桥逃来东台解放区之韩世德谈，江南人民至今犹念念不忘粟裕司令，前年当粟师长（当时粟为新四军第一师师长）奉命率部北撤时，老百姓个个流泪挽留，后来“中央”军来到，每村抽十个壮丁，每保收四支枪捐，每月每亩田要捐五斤大米。韩说：“我一家五口种七亩田，原是富足有余的，可是被捐税苦得不能过日子了。”新四军在时，江南人民只要缴很少的公粮，“中央”军真是“遭殃”军，这样捐那样税；流氓汉奸当了乡保长，青年被抽光了，他们都说：“粟裕快来救救我们吧，我们眼睛都要望穿了”。现韩世德已将家属搬来解放区，民主政府备加抚慰，并帮助其安家生产。按粟裕司令曾在江南领导新四军与人民一同浴血抗战，胜利后因遵守双十协定，争取全国和平民主的实现，乃忍痛北撤。
