Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Batavia dispatch: Dutch troops have recently been continuously violating the ceasefire agreement, advancing into the defense areas of the Indonesian army. The war near the west coast of Sumatra to the east has not yet ceased; although the war near Surabaya was calm for two days due to the ceasefire agreement between the two sides on January 24, the Dutch troops again launched a sneak attack on the 27th and occupied the town of Krian, which was originally in the hands of the Indonesian Republican Army. The Indonesian Minister of Defense, Sjarifuddin, has submitted a memorandum to the Indonesian-Dutch Joint Committee (specifically established to implement the ceasefire agreement), protesting against the Dutch troops' breach of contract and invasion. On the island of Celebes, the people continue to resist the Dutch occupation forces. Several thousand representatives of the people from all over the island recently gathered and passed a resolution refusing to recognize the so-called "East Indonesia Republic" shaped by the Netherlands alone (Note: This republic includes Celebes, Borneo, New Guinea and other islands, which was formed at the beginning of last month as a plan by the Dutch authorities to split the Indonesian people), and declared that the people of Celebes have always considered themselves part of the Indonesian Republic.

    一再违反停战协议
    荷军不断进攻印尼
    西里伯斯人民拥护印尼政府
    【新华社延安三日电】巴达维亚讯：荷兰军队近来不断破坏停战协定，向印尼军防地进犯。苏门答腊西岸以东附近战事，仍未停止；泗水附近战事虽因一月二十四日双方停战协议而平静两天，但二十七日起，荷军又偷袭并占领原在印尼共和军手中之克里安镇。印尼国防部长沙里佛已向印荷联合委员会（专为实施停战协定而设者）提出备忘录，抗议荷军违约进犯。在西里伯斯岛上，人民继续反抗荷兰占领军。该岛各地人民代表数千人，于日前集会通过决议，拒绝承认由荷兰一手塑造的所谓“东印度尼西亚共和国”（按：该共和国包括西里伯斯、婆州、新几内亚等岛，于上月初组成，为荷兰当局分裂印尼人民的计划），并宣称西里伯斯人民始终认为他们是印尼共和国的一部分。
