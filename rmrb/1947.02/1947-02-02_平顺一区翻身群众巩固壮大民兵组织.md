　　Ping Shun First District Liberated Masses Consolidate and Expand Militia Organization
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 27th] After the masses in the first district of Ping Shun were thoroughly liberated, their demands for arms became even stronger, and the militia organization was further strengthened. Within twenty days, the militia was expanded by 105 people. Now, there are more than 1,200 militiamen in the 30 villages of the entire district. Due to the increase of new blood, the quality of the militia has also been unprecedentedly improved, and landlords, bullies, and special agents who had infiltrated the militia have also been cleared out by the masses. The masses' love for arms is also unprecedented. For example, Guo Guocheng, an old farmer in the Chuan district, rose from a poor peasant to a middle peasant. At the fruit distribution conference, he asked his son to join the militia. When his son did not immediately decide, he said, "If you don't join the militia, I don't want this fruit." Seeing his father's insistence, his son hurriedly said, "Dad, don't worry, I was just considering." He immediately signed up with the director of the armed forces committee. Old Guo happily took the fruit and went home. Guo Qiuke, a poor peasant in the village, had been mobilized several times in the past but had not joined the militia. This time, after liberation, he voluntarily signed up and said, "I am a militiaman for my own sake." Some old militiamen, who had a lower level of awareness in the past and did not do a good job, have also made great progress now. For example, Geng Shuilin, a militiaman from Caodiangou, had two older brothers who joined the army. In the past, he often said, "Two people from my family have already gone out, so I won't do a good job and it will be enough." Now that his awareness has been raised, he has become an active militiaman.

　　平顺一区翻身群众巩固壮大民兵组织
    【本报太行二十七日电】平顺一区群众彻底翻身后，武装要求更高，民兵组织更加壮大，二十天内发展民兵即达一百零五人。现全区三十个村共有民兵一千二百余。由于新血液的增加，民兵质量也空前提高，混进民兵中的地主、恶霸、特务分子，也被群众清查出去。群众对于武装的热爱也是空前的。如川区老农郭过成，由贫农上升为中农，在分果实的大会上，即要他儿子参加民兵，他儿当下没决定，他就说：“你不参加民兵，我就不要这果实啦。”他儿见又是如此，忙说：“爹，不要急，刚才我是考虑。”说着即向武委会主任报了名，郭老汉才高兴的拿上果实回了家。该村贫农郭秋科，过去别人动员好几次都没参加民兵，这次翻身后，自动报名参加，并说：“我当民兵是给我自己干”。有些老民兵，过去觉悟较低，不好好干，现在也大大进步了，如草店沟民兵耿水林，他两个哥哥参了军，过去他常说：“俺家已出去两个人啦，我就不好好干，也算出够力啦。”现在觉悟提高，已成了一个积极的民兵。
