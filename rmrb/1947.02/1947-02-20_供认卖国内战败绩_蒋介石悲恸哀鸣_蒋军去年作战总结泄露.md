Confessing to Selling Out the Country and Defeats in the Civil War
Chiang Kai-shek's Sorrowful Lament
Chiang's Military's Summary of Last Year's Operations Leaked

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Just as the Yan'an headquarters were filled with confidence in victory, announcing the People's Liberation Army's brilliant achievements of annihilating 56 brigades of Chiang's troops in seven months, recovering 99 Chiang-occupied county towns, and killing or capturing 102 Chiang's generals, the Chiang army's operational summary of the past year, personally issued by the civil war ringleader Chiang Kai-shek with "Hai Xian Shi Tian Character No. 70 Secret Order," was filled with discouragement and pessimism. The full text of this secret order was captured by the People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng during the annihilation of Chiang's 79th Division's 16th Brigade in Bo County. In this summary, the Chiang bandit himself admitted the defeats in the past year's civil war of selling out the country. When reviewing the failures of various important battles, the summary stated: "The communication between troops and troops, and between commanders and commanders, is still not accurate, and the cooperation is not close. As a result, they watched and hesitated, missed the opportunity, and were defeated one by one by the 'enemy bandits' and perished together. For example, the defeat of the 3rd Division in Western Shandong and the capture of Division Commander Zhao (namely Zhao Bentian) are the greatest disgrace to our army!" Regarding the annihilation of the entire army due to the destruction of the headquarters, the summary stated: "Preventing the 'bandit side' from attacking the headquarters has been repeatedly warned, but the generals still failed to comply. The capture of Brigade Commander Huang (namely Huang Zhengcheng) of the 1st Brigade in Southern Shanxi, the failure of the 25th Division in the Northeast, the capture of Division Commander Li (namely Li Zhengyi), and the failure of the 69th Reorganized Division in Northern Jiangsu this time, and the suicide of Division Commander Dai (namely Dai Zhiqí), are all due to the negligence of one person at one time, which has greatly affected the entire war situation. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad." Regarding the annihilation of the entire army due to the sudden and powerful counterattack of the People's Liberation Army, the summary stated: "The annihilation of Brigade Commander Zhu Zhixi of the 99th Brigade in Huangqiao, Northern Jiangsu, was due to neglecting the 'Lushan Bandit Suppression Tactical Principles'." The summary also stated: "In the Lunan campaign, many strongholds occupied by our army were lost due to enemy counterattacks, and even brigade commanders and regimental commanders were killed in battle. For example, the capture of Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division in Western Shandong was due to this loss." After summarizing these failures, Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to beg his subordinates, saying: "The entire army, from top to bottom, whether in career, history, or life, is a whole, that is, glory is shared, disgrace is shared, life is shared, and death is shared. If the revolution fails (referring to Chiang's civil war of selling out the country), and the 'communist bandits' are rampant (referring to the victory of the people's patriotic self-defense war), then how can our officers and soldiers stand between heaven and earth?!" At the end of the summary, Chiang Kai-shek once again requested his troops, filled with failure and fear, to "open up the Longhai, Jinpu, Tongpu, Pinghan, and Middle East railway lines in the first half of next year (the 36th year of the Republic), and eliminate the 'remnant bandits' in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi." Very well, just as Commander Liu Bocheng, the ever-victorious general, said to reporters a few months ago: "Chiang Kai-shek believes this is a good deal and wants to continue. Very well, let him do it, and in the near future, the final reckoning will come." (Zérán)

　　供认卖国内战败绩
    蒋介石悲恸哀鸣
    蒋军去年作战总结泄露
    【本报特讯】正当延安总部充满着胜利信心、公布人民解放军七个月歼灭蒋军五十六个旅、收复蒋占县城九十九座、毙俘蒋军将官一百零二人的辉煌战绩之际，内战头子蒋介石亲自以“亥陷侍天字七十号密令”发出的蒋军去年作战总结，却充满着泄气和悲观。该密令全文，已在此次亳县蒋军七十九师十六旅的覆灭中，为刘伯承将军所部的人民解放军缴获。在这总结中，蒋贼自己承认了过去一年卖国内战的败绩。当检讨到各重要战役的失败时，该总结说：“各部队与部队间，各指挥官与指挥官间，联络仍不确切，合作亦未密切。致观望不前，贻误战机，遂被“敌匪”各个击破，同归于尽。如鲁西第三师之覆败，赵师长（即赵本田）之被俘，皆为我军莫大之耻辱！”谈及因为首脑部被歼、而致全军覆没时，该总结说：“防止‘匪方’袭击司令部，详见申诫，何只再三！然各将领仍未能奉行。晋南第一旅黄旅长（即黄正成）之被俘，东北二十五师之失败，李师长（即李正谊）之被俘，与此次整编第六十九师在苏北之失败，及戴师长（即戴之奇）之自杀，均以一人一时之疏失，致整个战局竟受莫大之影响。言念及此，不禁悲胸惨怀。”谈及因为人民解放军之突然有力反击而全军被歼时，该总结说：“第九十九旅旅长朱志席在苏北黄桥之覆灭，乃因忽视“庐山剿匪战术原则”所致。总结又说：“鲁南战役中，我军占领之据点，不少遭敌反扑失陷，甚至旅长团长因之阵亡。如第六十八师一一九旅刘旅长广信在鲁西之被俘，即坐此失。”蒋介石总结这些失败之后，乃不得不哀求他的部下说：“国军上下，无论事业历史生命，皆是整个的，即是荣则同荣，辱则同辱，生则同生，死则同死。如果革命失败（指蒋之卖国内战失败），“共匪”猖獗（指人民爱国自卫战争的胜利），则我全体官兵此复有何颜立于天地之间？！”在总结末尾蒋介石又再一次请求他那充满着失败与恐惧的部队，要在“明年（三十六年）上半年打通陇海、津浦、同蒲、平汉、中东铁路诸线，肃清冀、鲁、晋、陕等省境内之‘股匪’。”好罢，正如常胜将军刘伯承司令几个月前对记者所说的：“蒋介石认为这是一个好买卖，还要坚持下去。好罢，让他做下去吧，在不久的将来，就会算出总账来的。”（泽然）
