    Pengcheng Unites Merchants and Middle Peasants
    To Search for Hidden Wealth of Landlords

    [Reported by this newspaper] In the in-depth movement to fill in the gaps and make up for deficiencies in Pengcheng, attention was paid to uniting merchants and middle peasants to participate in the struggle, and to deeply mobilize the backward elements to surrender the wealth hidden for the landlords. Initially, the merchants and middle peasants in the town were afraid of the struggle. Some small and medium-sized merchants did not dare to open for business after the Lunar New Year, and some only sold old stock and did not dare to buy new goods. When district and village cadres discovered this situation, they immediately held unity meetings in various villages, explaining that small and medium-sized merchants and middle peasants were one family with workers and peasants, and that everyone should unite to defeat feudalism. After ideological work was done, Jia Taiyou, a merchant in Lianhe Village, said: "Once, the village held a meeting and didn't call me to participate, and I was scared, thinking that it must be my turn. I didn't sleep well for several nights. Today's meeting has put my mind at ease, and I will open for business immediately when I go back." After unity meetings were held in various villages throughout the town, many shops opened the next day. Furthermore, in the in-depth mobilization, Guo Lianqing, a militia member of Xinhua Village, was the first to surrender three bundles (equivalent to 140,000 yuan in foreign currency) hidden by Wang Laoxiu, the biggest feudal head in the town, and was immediately rewarded with 40,000 yuan worth of goods. Under this influence, it was successively discovered that several farmers, including Li Rong, were also keeping bundles for Wang Laoxiu, worth more than 900,000 yuan. Merchants also voluntarily reported the things they were keeping for traitors. Currently, various villages are continuing to clear away the hidden feudal vestiges.

    彭城团结商人中农
    搜查地主隐藏财物
    【本报讯】彭城在填平补齐深入运动中注意团结商人与中农参加斗争，并深入发动落后，献出为地主隐藏的财物。该镇商人和中农最初怕斗，有些中小商人旧历年后不敢开张，有的只卖旧底不敢买新货。区村干部发现这种情况，立即在各村召开团结会，说明中小商人、中农与工农是一家人，大家团结打垮封建。经过打通思想，联合村一个商人贾太有说：“有一次村上开会没叫我参加我就害了怕，想着一定要轮到咱头上了，好几夜没好好睡。今天这个会我才放下心，回去马上就开张。”全镇各村开过团结会后，第二天许多铺子都开了张。又在深入发动中，新华村民兵郭连清首先献出全镇大封建头子王老秀存的三个包袱（合洋十四万元），当即奖励给四万元的东西，在这影响下接连发现李荣等几个农民都替王老秀保存着包袱，价值九十多万元。商人也自动报出给汉奸保存的东西，现各村正继续扫清隐蔽封建尾巴。
