Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 4th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the following statement on the first of this month:

	The Chinese Political Consultative Conference, convened on January 10, 1946, in accordance with the provisions of the October 10, 1945, Kuomintang-Communist talks and composed of major Chinese political parties and social figures, is the highest political body in China recognized by the people of the whole country and the world powers. During the period when China does not have a truly democratic parliament, all important domestic and foreign affairs that must be approved by the parliament in other democratic countries should be considered valid only after being approved by this conference or the major parties within it. However, since January 10, 1946, the Chinese Kuomintang government has not only taken many arbitrary measures in domestic affairs, but also conducted several serious diplomatic negotiations with certain foreign governments alone in foreign affairs, and has concluded various written or oral, public or secret agreements and understandings in these negotiations, without going through the Political Consultative Conference or consulting with our party and other parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference. These diplomatic negotiations include borrowing money from foreign governments, continuing to lease materials, purchasing and accepting munitions and wartime surplus materials, concluding treaties on commerce, navigation, aviation, and other economic and legal privileges, requesting or allowing foreign naval, land, and air forces to station and operate in our country's territorial waters, territory, and airspace, entering or occupying, jointly constructing or jointly using our country's defense borders and military bases, requesting or allowing foreign military personnel or other personnel to participate in the organization, equipment, training, transportation, and military operations of our country's naval, land, and air military forces, gaining insight into our country's military secrets and other state secrets, and allowing foreign interference in our country's internal affairs and other serious matters. These measures by the Chinese Kuomintang government completely violate the will of the Chinese people and have already placed and will continue to place China in a serious crisis of civil war, reaction, national betrayal and humiliation, colonization, chaos, and collapse. In order to save the crisis of the motherland, safeguard national rights and interests, and the dignity of the Political Consultative Conference, our party hereby solemnly declares that for all foreign loans, all treacherous treaties, and all other above-mentioned agreements and understandings concluded unilaterally by the Kuomintang government after January 10, 1946, and all similar diplomatic negotiations that have not been approved by the Political Consultative Conference or have not been agreed to by our party and other parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference, our party does not recognize and will not assume any obligations now or in the future.

							The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, February 1st

    为挽救祖国危机维护国家权益
    中共中央郑重声明
    蒋政府对外所订一切丧权辱国条约
    中共均不承认并决不担负任何义务
    【新华社延安四日电】中国共产党中央委员会于本月一日发表声明如下：
    一九四六年一月十日根据一九四五年十月十日国共两党会谈纪要的规定而召开的由中国各主要党派与社会人士所组成的中国政治协商会议，是全国人民与世界列强所一致承认的中国最高政治机构。在中国未有真正民主国会期间，凡在其它民主国家须经国会通过的各种重要内政外交事项，自应经过这一会议或其中各主要党派的同意方能认为有效。但自一九四六年一月十日迄今，中国国民党政府不但在内政方面作了许多专擅的措施，并且在外交方面单独与若干外国政府进行了多次性质严重的外交谈判，并在这类谈判中成立了各种书面的或口头的、公开的或秘密的协定和谅解，而未曾经过政治协商会议的通过，亦未曾征询过本党和其它参加政治协商会议各党派的意见。这些外交谈判，包括向外国政府借款、继续租借物资、购买和承受军火和战时剩余物资，缔结关于通商、航海航空及其它经济、法律特权的条约，要求或允许外国海陆空军驻扎和活动于本国领海、领土、领空，进入或占领、共同建设或共同使用本国国防边塞和军事基地，要求或允许外国军事人员或其他人员参加与本国海、陆、空军事力量的组织、装备、训练、运输与军事行动，洞悉本国的军事秘密和其它国家秘密，允许外国干涉本国内政等严重事项。中国国民党政府的这些措施，完全违背中国人民的意志，已经使并将继续使中国陷于内战、反动、丧权辱国、殖民地化、混乱与崩溃的严重危机之中。本党为了挽救祖国的危机，维护国家权益和政治协商会议的尊严，兹特郑重声明，对于一九四六年一月十日以后由国民党政府单独成立的一切对外借款、一切丧权辱国条约及一切其它上述的协定、谅解，与今后未经政治协商会议通过或未经征得本党和其它参加政治协商会议各党派同意的一切同类外交谈判，本党在现在和将来均不承认，并决不担负任何义务。
              中国共产党中央委员会二月一日
