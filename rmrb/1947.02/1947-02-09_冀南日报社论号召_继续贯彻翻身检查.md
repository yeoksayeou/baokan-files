    Jinnan Daily Editorial Calls for Continued Implementation of Emancipation Review
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 6th] On the 3rd, the Jinnan Daily published an editorial entitled "Continue to Implement the Great Emancipation Review Movement." It first stated that since Jinnan concentrated its efforts on launching a mass emancipation movement in July of last year, most areas have overthrown feudal rule and realized "land to the tillers." The level of awareness of farmers has greatly increased, and the status and strength of farmers and feudal forces in rural areas have fundamentally changed, playing a significant role in the patriotic self-defense war. Although the achievements are great, it does not mean that the task of mass emancipation has been fully completed. There are still three serious problems that need to be addressed with continued effort.
    Thoroughly Eliminate Feudal Landlords
    First, some areas have not conducted a thorough review after the mass emancipation movement, or although they have undergone a review, it was not thorough and detailed enough. As a result, many feudal landlords have not been eliminated. For example, in a certain county, after a review, many cadres believed that there were no more problems and planned to shift to production. However, after an in-depth investigation with a focus, the landlords in two villages that were previously considered to be better were still landlords, and the land problem of the poor peasants was still not resolved or not resolved thoroughly. Many cadres were misled by the booming struggle situation, focusing more on the achievements and less on the shortcomings, believing that the land problem of the farmers had been solved. This kind of complacency must be guarded against and overcome, and the review movement should be further developed.
    Fair and Reasonable Distribution of Fruits
    Second, in some areas or villages, although the feudal exploitation of landlords has been eliminated, due to the leadership's lack of attention and assistance to the issue of fruit distribution and the failure to adopt the mass line, many fruits have not been distributed, or most have not been distributed, or the distribution is unfair. There is a phenomenon of a small number of cadres and activists enriching themselves and wasting or misappropriating the fruits. For example, a cadre in Weixian bought more than 80 mu of land in the struggle. A public security officer in a certain village originally had 30 mu of land and a family of six, and bought more than 80 mu of land in the struggle. A village cadre in a certain village originally had a house, bought one during the interest reduction last year, and then got another one during the democratic movement. A village cadre in a certain village took the fruits to do business, and it has not been resolved until now. An investigation of 101 villages in Weixian showed that all had fruit disputes. According to Comrade Li Ziyuan of the Weixian County Party Committee, if the land recovered from the landlords during the hired-tenant movement and the democratic movement can be distributed well, all 101 villages in the county can be supplemented with three mu of land. For example, in a village in Quzhou, thirteen houses were recovered from the landlords, including three good brick houses. The village chief, the director of the farmers' association, and the public security officer each wanted one, and as a result, many people without houses still had no houses to live in. When a village in a certain village distributed fruits, the village cadre announced that those with livestock could no longer want livestock. As a result, the village cadre did not implement this opinion first. The public security officer and the village deputy each took a cow, and the militia captain took a mule, while the masses who did not have livestock still could not get livestock. Furthermore, none of the cadres in a district in Jixian did not compete to purchase the fruits of the struggle. Such facts as above, whether in the new area or the old area, are relatively common and serious problems that urgently need to be solved. At the same time, they tell us that distributing fruits is a very difficult task, which requires our county and district-level cadres to personally participate or earnestly help the masses to solve it through the mass line. For villages where the fruits have not yet been distributed or have not been completely distributed, assistance should be given to the masses to quickly distribute them. For villages where the distribution is too unfair and the cadres and activists have distributed too much, they should be educated to give out most or part of the excess to the masses. Leading comrades at all levels should clearly recognize that the quality of the fruit distribution after the elimination of feudal exploitation is the decisive key to realizing "land to the tillers" and is the central link in solving the current problem of cadres being separated from the masses.
    Promote Democratic Work Style of Cadres
    Third, in some areas or villages, feudal rule has been overthrown, but the masses have not been mobilized, or although they have been mobilized once, they have subsided soon after due to the undemocratic work style of the cadres and the unfair distribution of fruits. Those who are in charge in the village are still a small number of village cadres and activists who are separated from the masses. The masses are dissatisfied with the activists and are unwilling and dare not manage affairs. According to materials from various places, this phenomenon is quite serious and quite common. To solve this problem, we must greatly promote democracy, permeate democracy into all our work, highly promote a democratic work style, and establish democratic centralism; that is, a highly democratic and highly centralized work system. Without the establishment of such a work style and system, it is impossible to closely link us with the masses and consolidate the advantage of the peasants in the countryside.
    The editorial continued: Solving the above three problems is a very difficult and arduous task. All localities should make specific arrangements according to different circumstances. Areas that are undergoing major inspections should pay attention to solving the above problems. Areas that have completed the inspection should seize the time before spring plowing to further conduct in-depth inspections. Border areas and war zones should be combined with the war, and places where wartime work is busy should be combined with wartime work. In order to do this work well, all localities should assist in leading the masses to launch a major emancipation movement, unify their will, concentrate their efforts, and implement thorough and detailed inspections through mass organizations and by adopting the mass line. In the new area, the method of organizing an emancipation inspection team or other methods can be adopted, and cadres from various departments can be transferred by the district party committee to various district villages for inspection. In the old area, the sub-district representative meeting can be the main focus, combined with the in-depth assistance of county and district cadres, to concentrate efforts to move forward. In particular, the district party committee should be personally responsible for in-depth inspections with a focus, creating experience and promoting the general.

### 冀南日报社论号召  继续贯彻翻身检查

    冀南日报社论号召
    继续贯彻翻身检查
    【本报威县六日电】三日冀南日报以继续贯彻翻身大检查运动为题发表社论。首称冀南从去年七月集中力量开展群众翻身运动以来，大部地区已打垮了封建统制，实现了耕者有其田，农民的觉悟程度大大提高，农民与封建势力在农村中的地位和力量已根本改变，对爱国自卫战争起了重大作用，成绩虽然很大，但并不等于说群众翻身的任务已经全部完成了，还存在着严重的三个问题，需要继续努力解决。
    彻底消灭封建地主
    第一、有的地区在群众翻身大动之后还没有进行大检查，或虽经过一度检查，由于不够深入细密，结果仍有很多封建地主没有消灭，如某县经过一度检查，好多干部认为已经没有了问题，要计划转生产了；但经过有重点的深入调查之后，过去认为较好的两个村，地主仍是地主，赤贫的土地仍未解决或解决的不彻底，不少干部被轰轰烈烈的斗争局面所迷惑，对成绩方面看的多，缺点看的少，认为农民土地问题已经解决了。这种麻痹自满现象必须警惕和克服，要进一步开展检查运动。
    公平合理分配果实
    第二、有些地区或村庄，地主的封建剥削虽然消灭了，由于领导上对分配果实问题重视帮助不够与没有采取群众路线，因此很多果实尚未分或大部未分或分的不公平，存在着少数干部积极分子中饱与浪费果实挪用果实的现象。如威县某干部在斗争中买到八十多亩地；某村公安员原有三十亩地六口人，从斗争中买到了八十多亩地；某村干原有宅子一座，去年减息时买了一座，后来民主运动中又得了一座；某村村干拿着果实做买卖，一直到现在还没有解决。威县一百零一个村庄的调查，全部存在果实纠纷。据威县县委李子元同志谈，在雇佃运动，民主运动中，从地主手中收回的土地，如能很好分配的话，全县一百零一个村庄都可补到三亩地。又如曲周一个村庄由地主手中收回十三座宅子，其中三座好砖房，村长、农会主任、公安员就各要了一座，结果许多没有房子的群众仍然没有房子住。某村分果实时，村干宣布了有牲口的不能再要牲口，结果首先村干不执行这种意见，公安员村副各取了一只牛，民兵队长取了一个骡子，而群众没牲口的则仍然得不到牲口。再如冀县一个区的干部，没有一个不争购斗争果实。诸如以上事实，无论新区或老区都是比较普遍而急待解决的严重问题，同时告诉了我们分果实是一件非常繁难的工作，需要我们县区各级干部亲自动手，或经过群众路线认真帮助群众去解决。对果实仍未分或未分完的村庄，应协助群众迅速分配，对分配过于不公平，干部积极分子分的过多的村庄，应教育他们拿出多分的大部或一部给群众。各级领导同志应明确认识在消灭封建剥削之后，果实分的好坏是实现耕者有其田的决定关键，是解决目前干部脱离群众的中心环节。
    发扬干部民主作风
    第三、有的地区或村庄封建统治打垮了，但群众未发动起来，或虽经过一度发动，由于干部作风不民主，分配果实不公，不久又消沉下去了，在村里做主的，仍是少数脱离群众的村干和积极分子。群众对积极分子不满，不愿与不敢管事。根据各地的材料来看，这种现象相当严重也相当普遍。解决这个问题，须要我们大大提倡民主，将民主渗透到一切工作中去，高度发扬民主作风，建立民主的集中制；即高度民主与高度集中的工作制度。没有这样的作风与制度的树立，想密切我们与群众的联系，巩固农民在农村的优势是不可能的。
    社论继称：解决上述三个问题，是一个非常繁难艰巨的工作，各地应根据不同情况作具体布置，正在进行大检查的地区，应注意解决上述问题；已经检查完毕的地区，在春耕前仍应抓紧时间进一步深入检查。边沿区和战争区与战争结合起来，战勤工作繁忙的地方，要和战勤结合进行。为了使这一工作做好，各地应协助领导群众翻身大动一样，统一意志，集中力量，通过群众组织，采取群众路线，深入细密的贯彻检查。在新区可组织翻身检查队的方式或其他方式，由区党委领导各部门抽调干部到各区村去检查，在老区可以小区代表会为主，结合以县区干部的深入帮助，集中力量向前推进。特别是区党委，亲自负责有重点的深入检查，创造经验、推动一般。
