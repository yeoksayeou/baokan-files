(This Newspaper, Taihang, 29th dispatch) The Wuxiang Old Liberated Area is actively conducting a review of the land reform, with one-third of the villages already completing the filling-in phase. The remaining villages are expected to conclude by the end of the lunar new year (mid-February). In the old liberated area of the county (six out of the county's eight districts are old liberated areas), the rent reduction policy was thoroughly implemented during the War of Resistance, the feudal rule has been fundamentally broken down, and most farmers have already been emancipated. The masses have a very high enthusiasm for this land reform review, and the movement is progressing rapidly. From mid-December last year to early January, over sixty of the one hundred and eighty-plus villages have completed the filling-in phase and transitioned into production. Most of the remaining villages are in the stage of distributing the fruits of labor, while a small number of backward villages are undergoing a concentrated effort. The main goal of this movement is to mobilize the backward masses. Each village has convened meetings of honest people, starting by encouraging them to pour out their grievances. Therefore, the mobilization of the masses this time is relatively thorough. For example, in Hanzhuang, more than five hundred people participated in the struggle out of the three hundred-plus households. The county-level leadership attaches special importance to the impoverished villages such as Panlong, Damai, Xingtang, and Houjiaba, which were severely devastated by the Japanese invaders, and plans to adjust and allocate resources from the fruits of the entire county.

　　武乡老区集中力量发动落后
    六十余村完成填补
    特别贫村由全县果实中调剂
    【本报太行二十九日电】武乡老区翻身检查，现正积极进行，三分之一村庄已经完成填补，其余村庄，旧历正月底（二月中旬）亦可全部结束。该县老区（全县八个区，六个是老区），抗战中减租政策贯彻较彻底，封建统治基本上已被打垮，大部农民已经翻身。这次翻身检查，群众情绪很高，运动进行亦迅速。自去年十二月中旬开始至一月初，一百八十余村庄中，已有六十余村庄完成填补，转入生产，其余大部村庄正在分配果实阶段，少数落后村庄，亦正在突击进行中。这次运动主要目标是发动落后群众，各村都召开了老实人会议，从启发他们诉苦入手，因此这次发动群众较为充分，如韩庄三百余户参加斗争的就有五百余人。对于蟠龙、大陌、型塘、侯家坝等受日寇摧残甚烈的贫瘠村庄，县级领导特别重视，计划从全县果实中加以调剂。
