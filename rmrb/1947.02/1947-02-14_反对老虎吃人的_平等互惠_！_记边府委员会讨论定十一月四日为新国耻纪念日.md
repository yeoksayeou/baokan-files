    Oppose the "Equality and Reciprocity" of Tigers Eating People!
    A Record of the Border Government Committee's Discussion to Designate November 4th as a New National Humiliation Memorial Day
    On the second day of the Border Government's third plenary session, group discussions were held on the Education Department's proposal to designate November 4th as a New National Humiliation Memorial Day. I participated in the Plain Group (Southern Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan). When I entered the meeting room, it was already packed with attendees and observers. Most of those present were elders over forty years old. They were older, had experienced more, and knew how many traitors there had been in Chinese history, but none had sold out the country as thoroughly as Chiang Kai-shek in the "Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce." The entire room was extremely indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's crime of auctioning off China.
    Jia Xinzhai, a 62-year-old member and Deputy Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office, was the first to speak. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country is the culmination of all historical betrayals, selling everything from the sky to the ground. In the past, Yuan Shikai betrayed China by signing the Twenty-One Demands with Japan, only selling Shandong and a few other provinces, but Chiang Kai-shek allows the United States to do whatever it wants in any part of China. What kind of country are we then!"
    Meng Futang, an educator from Hebei Province and Director of the Southern Hebei Administrative Office, said, "The Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce stipulates that Americans can freely enjoy rights in China that Chinese people cannot. The Chinese people will not allow Americans to come to China and undermine Chinese sovereignty in this way!"
    Jia Guangyao, a legal expert in the border region and Vice President of the Border Government Higher Court, pointed out from a legal perspective that the Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce not only violated the basic rights of the Chinese people but also violated international conventions in many areas (such as Americans arbitrarily opening factories in the Chinese interior without going through customs or paying taxes). Chiang Kai-shek used "equality and reciprocity" to deceive the Chinese people, and we should thoroughly expose this!" Before he finished speaking, Mr. Shi Minxing, a Kuomintang elder in the audience, angrily interjected, "The 'equality' in the Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce is the same as the 'equality' in the 'Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty' after Japan invaded Korea! How can the Kuomintang govern the country with such a scoundrel?!" Mr. Shi took off his hat and said loudly, "Yuan Shikai lived for how many days after signing the Twenty-One Demands? How many days did Wang Jingwei live after signing the 'Japan-Wang Secret Agreement'? Chiang Kai-shek signed the 'Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce,' how many days can he still live?!"
    Vice President Jia gave an example, saying, "The 'equality and reciprocity' of the Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce is like a brutal robber and a paralyzed weakling signing an agreement that they can freely enter each other's houses. The robber can enter, but how dare the weakling enter the robber's door?"
    At the meeting, all comrades agreed to designate November 4th as a New National Humiliation Memorial Day. When discussing memorial methods, Mr. Shi especially hoped to include this event in textbooks so that the whole country would know about it and take action.
    The Plain Group meeting adjourned, but the Mountain Group (Taihang and Taiyue) had not yet adjourned. Their discussions were equally heated. They used the example of "a tiger saying to a person, let's eat each other" to expose the traitorous essence of the Chiang-American Treaty of Commerce. We must resolutely oppose the "equality" of tigers eating people! (Xiù Shān)

    反对老虎吃人的“平等互惠”！
    记边府委员会讨论定十一月四日为新国耻纪念日
    边府第三次全体委员会第二天，分组讨论教育厅关于定十一月四日为新国耻纪念日之提案。笔者参加了平原小组（冀南、冀鲁豫），进入会议室时，列席的旁听的已挤满屋子。在座的多为四十岁以上的长者，他们年纪大，经过的事情多，知道中国历史上曾经有过多少个卖国贼，却没有像蒋介石这次所订“蒋美商约”卖国卖的干净。对于蒋介石此种拍卖中国的罪行，全场极为愤慨。
    冀鲁豫行署副主任六十二岁的贾心斋委员第一个发言，他说：“蒋介石卖国是积历史上卖国之大成，从天上到地下都卖光了。过去袁世凯出卖中国，向日本订立二十一条件，仅仅出卖了山东等几省，而蒋介石却允许美国在中国任何地方胡闹，我们还算什么国家！”
    河北省教育家冀南行署主任孟夫唐委员说：“蒋美商约规定了中国人在中国的权利，美国人可以随便享受，中国人不能享受的权利，美国人倒可以享受，中国人民是不允许美国人进中国来如此破坏中国主权的！”
    边区法律家边府高等法院副院长贾光尧委员从法律观点指出蒋美商约不仅侵犯了中国人民的基本权利，而且在许多地方（如美国人在中国内地任意开工厂、不经海关口亦不纳税）违犯了国际公约。蒋介石用了“平等互惠”来哄骗中国人民，我们应该深入揭破这一点！”他的话没说完，旁听席上的国民党元老时敏行先生气愤的接上说：“蒋美商约的‘平等’，就等于日本侵略朝鲜后订立的‘日韩合并’那种‘平等’！国民党出了这样的坏蛋，怎样能治国？！”时老先生说到这里把帽子一摘，大声的说：“袁世凯订了廿一条活了几天？汪精卫订了‘日汪密约’活了几天？蒋介石订立了‘蒋美商约’，他还能活几天？！”
    贾副院长举了个例子说：“蒋美商约的‘平等互惠’好像一个粗暴的强盗和一个瘫患的弱者订了个协定，互相可以随便进入对方的屋里。强盗可以进，弱者怎么敢进强盗的门？”
    会议上，全体同志同意订十一月四日为新国耻纪念日。讨论纪念办法时，时老先生还特别希望把这件事编入教科书的事，让全国知道都来办。
    平原小组散会了，山地小组（太行与太岳）还没散，他们讨论的同样热烈，他们用“一个老虎对一个人说，咱们相互吃一口”的例子来揭破蒋美商约的卖国实质。老虎吃人的“平等”，我们要反对到底！（秀山）
