Taihang, Southern Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan Party and Government Organs
Launch Production and Economy Drive
Director Li of the Taihang Administrative Office Calls on Everyone to Make Production and Economy Plans

[Report from our Taihang Office, 15th] To overcome financial difficulties, the Taihang District Party Committee and the Administrative Office, after lowering living standards, have launched a mass production and economy drive. At the mobilization meeting of the District Party Committee organs on the 8th, Comrade Lai Ruoyu called on all cadres to display the spirit of working alongside the masses in Taihang Mountain in 1942 and 1943, during the production drive to overcome famine, sharing life and death, eating coarse grains and salted vegetables together, and engaging in production together, from top to bottom. In order to strengthen the front lines, greet victory, and not increase the burden on the people, this year, in addition to leading the masses in production, we must also do a good job in the production and management of government organs. The District Party Committee organs are now studying further economy measures and this year's production plans for each individual. The Administrative Office also held a mobilization meeting for production and economy in government organs a few days ago. Director Li Yiqing announced at the meeting his own production plan for this year: learn to spin cotton, plant fifty hemp plants and fifty pumpkins. His economy plan is: not to receive the full annual subsidy, clothing, and office supplies from the public. Regarding the production of the Administrative Office organs, Director Li emphasized agriculture, sideline occupations, handicrafts, transportation, and workshops. Strive to achieve 50% self-sufficiency in cadres' living expenses this year. Last year, agricultural and sideline production only accounted for 10% of total production, and transportation accounted for 12%; this year, transportation and sideline occupations should each account for 18%, and agriculture should account for 9.5%, reducing commercial production. Agricultural production should be based on the principle of "sparrow warfare," planting small plots of land, and not competing with the people for land. Economy measures should be based on the idea of accumulating small amounts to make large amounts, and accumulating zeros to make whole numbers. Implement scientific management, make government financial affairs transparent, make abiding by the system a conscious action of the masses, and promote the utilization of waste materials, such as using waste paper and waste envelopes for office work, to reduce waste. Call on everyone to make their own production and economy plans. Secretary-General Wu Guangtang then announced the draft plan for organ production: this year, the production task for all cadres and miscellaneous personnel in the entire office is 10,000 yuan per person, to be completed through vegetable growing and handicraft production. Each person must also plant 30 hemp plants to solve the problem of lamp oil for the organs. He also announced measures to economize on office supplies and public expenses. The leading organs in Taihang have recently lowered their living standards by 12%. The Administrative Office organs' economy plan this time has further reduced the amount of the organs' production subsidy (i.e., the part of the organs' expenses subsidized by their own production) by 23.5% compared to the past.

[Report from our Southern Hebei Office, 15th] The Southern Hebei Administrative Office is launching an economy drive. All cadres and miscellaneous personnel have unanimously decided that the public expenses for the first half of the year, amounting to 11,760 jin of rice, will all be supplied by organ production. Starting from the 1st, each person will save 1 liang of rice per day from their meals, and everyone is actively formulating personal plans. Director Meng and Deputy Director Wang will each save a set of unlined clothing, a year's worth of rice subsidies, and the shoe and sock expenses for the first half of the year. Director Du of the Civil Affairs Department and six others will not receive shoe and sock expenses for the first half of the year, and Director Du will also save a set of unlined clothing. Director Zhang of the Education Department and three others will also each save a set of unlined clothing and the rice subsidies for the first half of the year. Guards Yan Xiuchen and Liu Qingjiang will also save all the rice subsidies, shoes, socks, and other expenses for the first half of the year. The entire office will save more than 6,000 jin of rice in shoe and sock expenses, and many comrades will also save on matches and barber fees.

[News from our office] According to Jia Xinqi, Deputy Director of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office, after the Border Region Government decided to lower the living standards of cadres, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office immediately decided to reduce the subsidy for cadres to 6 jin of rice across the board. All Party, government, and military cadres in the region decided to save 2 liang of millet per person per day across the board, and launched a "self-assigned task" movement. In addition to saving all clothing subsidies, etc., they are actively engaged in production. Preliminary statistics at the Administrative Office level show that more than 800,000 yuan has been saved. All comrades have expressed that they can work as long as they have food to eat. It is estimated that a total of more than 2 million yuan can be saved. (Xiu Shan)

    【本报冀南十五日电】冀南行署展开节约运动。全体干杂人员，一致决定上半年的公杂费米一万一千七百六十斤，全部由机关生产供给，并从一日开始，每人每日节约伙食米一两，并纷纷制定个人计划。孟主任及王副主任今年节约单衣一套，津贴米一年，及上半年的鞋袜费。民政处杜处长等七人均不领上半年的鞋袜费，杜处长并节约单衣一套。教育处张处长等四人，也各节约单衣一套及上半年的津贴米。警卫员阎秀臣、刘清江，也把上半年津贴米、鞋、袜等费全部节约。全署节约鞋袜费共米六千余斤，并有很多同志节约火柴及理发费。
    【本报讯】据冀鲁豫行署副主任贾心齐谈称：自边区政府决定降低干部生活水平后，冀鲁豫行署即确定干部津贴一律降为六斤米。全区党政军干部决定每人每日一律节约小米二两，并掀起“自认任务”运动，个人应领衣服津贴等全部节约外，并积极生产，行署一级初步统计已节约八十余万元，全体同志表示，只要有吃的就能工作。估计全部可节约二百多万元左右。（秀山）
