　　[This dispatch from our Jinan office on the 13th] After the Chiang troops occupying Daming were forced to retreat, personnel from our Daming County government immediately entered the area to investigate the disaster and carry out appeasement and relief work. Our government has now issued loans of 2 million yuan to provide initial relief to the masses in the urban area and the third and fourth districts who have suffered greatly under Chiang's disaster. We will continue to find ways to provide relief in the future. During the month or so that Chiang's troops occupied Daming, they massacred 70 to 80 mass leaders and village cadres in our urban area. Our government, in conjunction with the masses, has found 60 to 70 bodies, and is now preparing to hold a memorial service and funeral. The Third Prefectural Committee has given the following four key points for the post-disaster work in Daming: (1) In future work, we must be especially cautious and appropriately handle the issue of mass revenge; (2) We should hold a grand meeting to commemorate the heroic militiamen, village cadres, and the masses who sacrificed themselves, and provide condolences and relief to their families; (3) We must mobilize and organize the masses to settle accounts with the evil landlords and bad eggs, in order to express grievances and relieve emotions; (4) After the post-disaster work is completed in a concentrated way, we should immediately move into an examination of emancipation, an equal and reasonable distribution of the fruits, and the implementation of land reform.
