　　Turned-over Masses Show Great Enthusiasm for Supporting the Army
    Xi Tu@ Automatically Turns and Airs Public Grain
    [From our Changzhi correspondent] After their liberation, the masses in Xitu@ Village, Wuan County, have shown increasingly high enthusiasm for supporting the army and the government. They deeply understand that grain is the material foundation for guaranteeing the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Therefore, under the leadership of cadres and the Farmers' Association, they actively turned and aired the public grain, completing the turning and airing of more than 110,000 jin of public grain in two days. On the second day, when they had just spread more than 90,000 jin of public grain on the square for drying, a torrential rain suddenly fell, making it impossible for them to transport the public grain back. At that time, everyone disregarded the rain and rushed home to bring out all the mats in their homes to cover the public grain; some even took out quilts and mattresses. Through their selfless rescue efforts, the public grain suffered no damage whatsoever.
    Since the moving news of Xitu@'s turning and airing of public grain spread, a competition has been launched in various villages, all wanting to be models for turning and airing public grain. Dongmazhuang Village and Wuji Village are also turning and airing public grain on rainy days.

　　翻身群众拥军热情高
    西土＠自动翻晒公粮
    【本报长治讯】武安西土＠村群众翻身后拥军拥政热情益高，他们深知粮食是保证爱国自卫战争胜利的物质基础，故在干部和农会领导下，积极翻晒公粮，两天内即将十一万多斤公粮全部翻晒完毕。在第二天，当他们把九万多斤公粮刚刚晒在广场时，忽然倾盆大雨，使他们无法把公粮运回。当时每个人不顾雨淋，急忙跑回家中，把全家的席子拿出来遮盖公粮；有的甚至拿出被子和褥子，经过他们奋不顾身的抢救，使公粮没有受到一点损失。
    自从西土＠翻晒公粮的动人消息传出后，各个村都掀起了竞赛，都要做翻晒公粮的模范。东马庄村、午汲村同样在多雨的日子里翻晒着公粮。
