Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: A Tokyo reporter close to the Japanese government revealed that the machinery and equipment of paper mills seized by Japan from our country have now been secretly moved to Hokkaido and are being operated by the Mitsui and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu. The Yoshida Cabinet has disbursed huge sums from the national treasury to subsidize their commencement of operations in mid-September. Among them, "Osa Paper Manufacturing Company" is the largest in scale, and all of its equipment was seized from our country. The Japanese Zaibatsu has called it a "spoils of war factory." Overseas Chinese in Japan, upon hearing this news, are all filled with indignation, and believe that the existence of such factories is an insult to the dignity of our nation and people. According to international law, such plundered items should be unconditionally returned to our country.
