    Movement Deepens on the Basis of Victory in Land Redemption
    North Dongfang Settles Accounts with "Black Bureau"
    Arch-Traitor Zhu Fang Executed, Ten Thousand Cheer
    Pictures and Photos Evoke Tears of Blood and Hatred

    Last month, the masses of North Dongfang, with extreme grief and indignation, braved the rain to gather and denounce the towering crimes of the traitor Zhu Fang. The poor people who had been forced to flee all rushed back home to participate in the meeting. On the streets and in the meeting place, there were serial pictures drawn by the turn-over team depicting the forced grain requisition, forced levies, and forced floral tributes. The people surrounding the pictures couldn't help but tell of their grievances and shed tears. Zhang Cheng's wife and the three old ladies from the families of Zhang Hua and Kong Qingrui saw the tragic scenes of their loved ones hanging themselves and being murdered, and they cried aloud. Everywhere, people were pointing and cursing Zhu Fang as inhuman, telling of his evil deeds of carrying a box to rape women and acting violently and despotically. The young people, as if crazy, shouted in the streets, "Avenge grievances, redress wrongs!" Old man Zhang Xin dug out the bloody clothes of his nephew Zhang Hua, which he had buried for a year, and grabbed Zhu Fang's chest, asking, "Isn't this ironclad proof of your murder? You forced my brother Zhang Cheng to hang himself, and I was counting on my nephew Zhang Hua to bury me, but you killed him too! You've got this day coming! Today the Eighth Route Army is here, the Salvation Association (Farmers' Association) is established, it's time for you to pay with your life!" An old lady surnamed Liu, who had run back from dozens of miles away, rushed to the meeting place to demand the land that had been seized from her by Zhu Fang. She said angrily, "We, the common people, fattened this pig! It's time to slaughter the pig and pay the debts!" Wang Jianbang, the head of Zhangli Village, who had been detained and beaten by Zhu Fang for sending public grain to the Eighth Route Army, also came to participate in the meeting. He cursed Zhu Fang, "You said I was in league with the Eighth Route Army, you led troops to rob Zhangli Village, and you robbed my family of even the dowry clothes, and you even wanted to tear down my house. Tear it down now! You dog traitor, it's not a loss even if you are cut into a thousand pieces!" Wang Jingyu, the militia captain, tearfully recounted the tragic history of being chased by the "Black Bureau" and not daring to go home, selling seven or eight acres of land at home, and two brothers starving to death. He also took out the letter of appointment from the Japanese advisor Abe to Zhu Fang (with the sun flag printed on it), which he had found in Zhu Fang's home after returning with the Eighth Route Army, and pointed to Zhu Fang, saying, "Your backstage boss has fallen! You still don't plead guilty to the people. If the Eighth Route Army hadn't captured you, you don't know how many more people you would have harmed!" In the face of conclusive witnesses and material evidence, Zhu Fang finally bowed his head and confessed his guilt. According to the opinions of the masses, the government executed the traitor Zhu Fang on the spot, and the masses responded with cheers that resounded through the clouds.

    On August 12th, the masses further launched a liquidation struggle against the traitorous and despotic village chiefs Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Rui, Zhao Tonggong, and others. They thoroughly denounced their crimes of relying on the power of the "Black Bureau" of the traitor Zhu Fang to oppress the people and embezzle for their own benefit. The amount of embezzled and extorted money was calculated to be 8,826,000 yuan. In order to take care of their lives, the masses voluntarily gave up half and only compensated 4 million yuan. At this point, the mass movement in North Dongfang has entered a stage of in-depth liquidation and complete turn-over. (Bing Ru, Zhu Qin)

    赎地胜利基础上运动深入
    北东坊清算“黑局子”
    巨奸朱方伏法万众欢呼
    图画与像片引起血泪恨
    北东坊群众以极度的悲愤于上月曾冒雨集会，控诉汉奸朱方的滔天罪恶。被逼逃亡的苦人，都赶回家来，参加大会。街道上，会场里，都有翻身队画的逼粮逼款逼花的连环图，围着看画的人，不自禁的诉说着自己的冤苦，掉下眼泪。张成的女人和张华、孔庆瑞家三个老太太，看见自己亲人上吊和被害的惨景，放声痛哭。街头巷尾，都在指骂朱方不是人，诉说他提着盒子强奸妇女，行凶霸道的恶行。年青人像疯了一样，满街呼喊着“有仇报仇有冤申冤。张欣老汉刨出他埋了一年的侄儿张华的血衣，抓着朱逆的胸襟问：“这是你杀人的铁证不是？你把我兄弟张成逼得上了吊，我指望我侄儿张华来埋我，你把他也杀了！你也有今天啊！今天八路军来啦，救命会（农会）立起啦，该到你偿命啦！”当天从几十里外跑回来的一位姓刘的老太太，赶到会场向朱逆要她被霸占的土地。她愤怒的说：“咱老百姓把这口猪养肥啦！该到杀猪还债啦！”因给八路军送公粮而被朱逆扣押吊打过的章里集保长王建邦也赶来参加大会。他痛骂朱逆：“你说我通八路，你领兵来抢了章里集，把我家连嫁装衣服都抢光，还要掀我房子，你现在掀吧！你这千刀万剐也不亏的狗汉奸！”南东坊一个卖豆芽的老汉诉说着自己三个兄弟均被朱逆杀死的冤事，两只眼气得血红，痛打了朱逆好几耳光。民兵队长王景玉挥泪诉说自己被黑局子追逐着不敢回家，家里卖掉七、八亩地，饿死两个兄弟的惨史，又把自己随八路军打回来以后从朱逆家里搜出来的日本顾问阿部给朱逆的委任状（上面印着太阳旗），展开在大众面前，指着朱逆说：“你的后台老板倒啦！你还不向人民请罪，要不是八路军捉回你来，你还不知道要害多少人哩！”朱逆在确凿的人证物证之前，终于低头认罪。政府根据群众意见，当场处决了汉奸朱方，群众报以响彻云霄的欢呼。
    八月十二日，群众进一步展开对汉奸恶霸保长王允生、赵瑞、赵桐公等的清算斗争。将他们依靠汉奸朱方“黑局子”势力欺压人民，贪赃自肥的罪恶作了彻底控诉。算出贪污讹诈账八百八十二万六千元。群众为照顾他们生活，自动让了一半，只赔四百万元。至此，北东坊的群众运动已进入深入清算，彻底翻身的阶段。（冰如、祝勤）
