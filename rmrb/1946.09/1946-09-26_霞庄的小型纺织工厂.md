　　The Small Textile Factory in Xiazhuang
　　Zhang Peili
    Xiazhuang is a small village in the first district of Licheng, with more than two hundred households. It is the village with the best textile development in the whole county. In 1943, when textile production had not yet been developed in Licheng, and the government was advocating women's textile production to struggle for self-sufficiency in clothing, the first textile group in Xiazhuang appeared under the active leadership of Li Xiulian. Its emergence can be said to have broken the old-fashioned idea that women in Licheng could not spin.

    When this textile group was established, the government cherished its birth and provided a large amount of cotton funds, which gradually expanded the textile group. In the first year, it expanded to five spinning groups, with 67 women participating. By the spring of last year, it had developed to 25 textile groups, and there was not a single woman in the village who was not in a textile group.

    Xiazhuang's textile industry not only developed greatly, but also improved its technology. Many women, under the slogan of striving for "good cloth," received government rewards and commendations. They launched competitions between groups and challenges between individuals. Until last winter, new heroes emerged, and women listed as producing "good cloth" accounted for 75% of the total number of women in the village. Last year, Licheng held a labor hero conference, and Xiazhuang's textile industry received awards, and Li Xiulian was selected as the top textile hero in the county.

    Since the beginning of spring this year, Xiazhuang's textile industry, due to the improvement of technology and the special increase in cloth production, the old textile groups could no longer meet their requirements. Also, because the government called for "cultivating three and saving one," to exceed the great production movement of any previous year, the women urgently needed a way to increase production, and they put this opinion to the government.

    In early April of the lunar calendar, Xiazhuang Village held a joint conference of parents, the village government, cooperatives, and women. After seven days of discussion, they found a new way to make money—Xiazhuang's small textile factory was established.

    The factory is located in the large temple in Xiazhuang Village, with iron looms, wooden looms, spinning wheels, thread winding machines, sock knitting machines… After breakfast, women come from all corners of the village. They work about eight and a half hours a day. Women with children and those who cook have two hours less than other women. More than 30 women produce 30 towels, 20 pairs of socks, 17 zhang (1.4 feet wide) of patterned bed sheets, and 2.8 zhang of cloth a day.

    They handed over these finished products to the cooperative and took back raw materials, cotton and thread, from the cooperative. The cooperative manager, Old Wang, stroked his beard and said with a smile: "Our village's textile industry was helped by the cooperative's loans and cotton purchases, haha! Now my cooperative has become the buyer and customer of the women's factory." Indeed, the cooperative has specially bought several mules for the women of Xiazhuang to purchase cotton and transport cloth for sale.

    With the development of the textile industry, the cooperative has also prospered. The old manager proudly said: "When the textile factory was first established, it was annoying to let the cooperative help. The cloth was not good, it could not be sold, and I was worried all day long. Now the soft towels and the white cloth are easy to sell. The livestock runs a trip from Handan to Changzhi, and the transportation profit from textiles alone, deducting 5% of the market price per foot of cloth, the cooperative's funds now have..." The old man raised his left thumb and gestured powerfully, saying: "One million yuan!"

    The women living in the small factory lead an organized collective life. Li Xiulian is their life captain, and their organizational structure is the factory management committee. This committee is composed of six people, two parents, two village government personnel, and two women, and they are elected through democratic means. They are guiding and planning everything in this factory, and everyone strictly abides by the rules and regulations of the management committee. On odd days, there are two hours of study, mainly literacy and writing imitation. Now, most people can recognize more than one hundred characters, and some women can recognize up to three hundred characters. Sometimes, current affairs education and ideological review are carried out. Recently, they can also carry out self-criticism and mutual criticism. Their attitudes are friendly and very sincere, which is very touching.

    Li Xiulian told me: "The establishment of this small factory is beneficial to both the public and the private. We have learned skills, our personal thinking has been improved, we can recognize characters, we know about national affairs, and at the same time, the money everyone earns takes care of personal family life."

    This small factory is different from the small training factories opened by general district joint cooperatives and county joint cooperatives, because firstly, the women do not leave their family life, secondly, the work is calculated by the number of feet (one point is given for each foot of cloth woven), it does not matter if they arrive early or late, and thirdly, the women also learn skills, and they learn many kinds of things, weaving cloth, weaving towels, and knitting socks.

    In order for the women to have various skills, they extracted 45% of the profits from their textiles to hire a technician to teach them. In two and a half months, nine women have learned the complete skill set. The only thing they have not yet learned is how to knit socks, because the machine is broken and cannot be completely repaired immediately.

    In order to exchange experience, before the Labor Hero Conference, they summarized everything about this small textile factory in two and a half months. In terms of profits, because the women were new to learning, they gained less, earning 50 yuan less per month than when weaving and embroidering in the textile group. But they were not discouraged by the small profit. Li Xiulian said confidently: "As long as we study for another month, you will see! We guarantee it will be better than in the spinning group."

    I asked her why it would be stronger than the textile group, and she said without hesitation: The profit earned by women who have now learned the complete skill set has already exceeded the 30 yuan previously earned in the textile group, because the factory distributes profits based on the number of feet.

    At this district Labor Hero Conference, she was again selected as the first special-class textile hero in the entire district. According to her, "Now the whole village has a total of 145 spinners and 75 weavers, 144 spinning wheels, and 40 looms. From the beginning of November in the lunar calendar last year to July this year, a total of 13,900 feet of cloth have been woven in six months. It is estimated that 3,200 feet of cloth can be woven in August, September, and October, for a total of 17,100 feet of cloth in eleven months. In addition to the needs of the whole village, 6,700 feet can still be sold. The result of this production has laid a solid foundation for the realization of 'cultivating three and saving one'."

　　霞庄的小型纺织工厂
　　张培礼
    霞庄是黎城一区的一个小村落，有二百多家人家，是全县纺织发展最好的一个村，四三年黎城纺织还未开展，政府正在提倡妇女纺织为自给衣布而斗争的时候，霞庄第一个纺织小组便在李秀莲积极领导下出现了，它的出现可以说打破了黎城妇女不会纺织的古老守旧思想。
    当这个纺织小组产生以后，政府爱惜他的新生，便大量的贷给棉花资金，使这个纺织组渐渐发展扩大起来，第一年扩展到五个纺花组，参加妇女有六十七人，到去年春天便发展到二十五个纺织组，全村里没有一个妇女不在纺织组里了。
    霞庄的纺织不仅得到了大量发展，而且也提高了技术，有不少妇女在为“好布”而努力的口号下，受到了政府的奖励与表扬，他们展开组与组的竞赛，人与人的挑战，直到去年冬天，新生的英雄涌现了，列入“好布”之列的妇女占全村妇女总数百分之七十五，去年黎城开劳英大会，霞庄的纺织受到了奖励，李秀莲被选为全县纺织英雄头一名。
    今年入春以来，霞庄的纺织由于技术的提高，布产量的特增，这旧有的纺织组已不能满足她们的要求，又因为政府号召耕三余一，要超过以往任何一年的大生产运动，妇女们急切地需要一个增多产量的办法，她们向政府提出了这个意见。
    阴历四月初，霞庄村召开了家长、村政府、合作社、妇女的联席大会，经七天的讨论，他们找到了新的发财门路——霞庄的小型纺织工厂便成立起来了。
    工厂设在霞庄村的大庙里，有铁机、有木机、纺车、拐线车、打袜机……早饭后妇女们就从村里各个角落走来，一天约八时半的工作，有孩子的、做饭的妇女们要比一般妇女少两个钟头，三十多个妇女，一天要出产三十条毛巾，二十双袜子，花面被单十七丈（尺四面），布二丈八尺。
    这些成品她们交给了合作社，又从合作社拿回来原料，棉花和线，合作社经理老王摸着胡子笑咪咪的说：“俺村纺织是由合作社放货款，购棉花帮助起来，哈哈！现今我这合作社成了妇女工厂的买主和顾客了。”的确是这样，合作社专门买了几匹骡子给霞庄妇女们购棉花运销布。
    随着纺织的发展，合作社也跟着繁荣起来，老经理得意的说：“初成立纺织厂时，让合作社来帮助，那时合作社干部都讨厌，布不好，卖不了，一天价发愁，现在毛软软的手巾，白展展的布可好出手，牲口从邯郸长治跑一趟，单分纺织的运输利，每尺布抽市价百分之五，本社资金现在有了……”老头子翘起左母指比划了一下很有力的说：“一百万元！”
    生活在小型工厂里的妇女们，她们过着有组织的集体生活，李秀莲是她们的生活队长，她们的组织机构是工厂管理委员会，这个委员会由六人组成，两个家长、两个村政人员、两个妇女，而且是经过民主方式选出来的。他们在指导和计划着这个工厂的一切，大家也都十分遵守着管理委员会的规则与章程。逢单日有二点钟的学习，主要识字、写仿，现在一般的能识一百多字，有的妇女能识到三百个字，有时进行时事教育思想检讨，最近她们也能展开自我批评与互相批评，态度友爱，都非常真诚，很使人感动。
    李秀莲告我说：“这个小型工厂成立，是公私都有利，本事学下啦，个人思想也锻炼好啦，字也认的啦，国家大事也知道啦，同时大家所赚的钱也照顾了个人家里生活啦。”
    这个小型工厂不同一般区联社县联社开的小型训练工厂，因为第一是妇女们不脱离家庭生活，第二计工是按尺数打分，（每织一尺布打一分）早到迟到没关系，第三同样使妇女学到了技术，而且学的样数也多，织布、织手巾，打袜子都学。
    妇女们为了自己有各方面的技术，从她们纺织的红利中抽出百分之四十五聘请了一位技师，让这个技师来教导她们，两个半月的时间已经有九个妇女学成了全把式。现在尚未学会的只是打袜，因机器坏了，马上还不能完全修好。
    为了交流经验，在开劳英会前，她们总结了这个小型纺缴工厂在二月半的时间里所有的一切，在红利方面，由于妇女们初学，得利较少，比在纺织组的织布绣花一月少得五十元。但她们并不因利小而气馁。李秀莲十分自信的告我说：“只要我们再学他一个月，你看！保管要比在纺花组里强”。
    我问她为什么就能比纺织组强，她毫不迟疑的说；现在学会全把式的妇女所得的利已经超过了原在纺织组里的三十块，因为工厂里是按尺打分分利。
    这次全区劳英大会上，她又被选为全区的纺织英雄特等第一名，据她说：“现在全村共有纺妇一百四十五名，织妇七十五名，纺车一百四十四架，织布机四十架，从阴历去年十一月初到今年七月共六个月已织布一万三千九百尺。预计八、九、十三个月还能织三千二百尺，共十一个月织布一万七千一百尺，除全村需用外，尚可卖出六千七百尺。这样生产的结果，已给实现“耕三余一”打下了有力的基础。
