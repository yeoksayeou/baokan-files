　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 26th: The CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau has issued a call to the army and people of the entire border region to launch a full-scale self-defense counterattack and crush Chiang Kai-shek's new offensive, stating: Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against our liberated areas is increasingly expanding in scale, and the offensive against our people's city of Zhangjiakou along the Ping-Sui Railway from both the east and west is about to begin. At this critical moment, we call on the army and people of the entire border region to engage in heroic combat, work together, launch a full-scale self-defense counterattack, and defend our new Zhangjiakou, our new Chahar, and the entire Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area! (1) Make thorough arrangements, fight heroically, and all soldiers must display the heroic spirit of fighting to the death to defend the interests of the motherland and the people, obey orders, abide by discipline, and resolutely and ruthlessly annihilate the invaders. The people must cooperate in the war, assist the main force, and completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. If Chiang's army occupies an inch of our land, we will make them pay a bloody price! (2) Consolidate the rear, eliminate spies and secret agents. All rear personnel must conscientiously and responsibly stick to their posts and obey the self-defense war effort. The vast number of people in cities and villages, especially urban workers, are admired for their spirit of working hard, day and night, without fear of hardship. Now we must further develop this spirit. (3) In areas temporarily occupied by Chiang's army, we must extensively launch mass guerrilla warfare, harass, contain, and strike the invaders everywhere, and carry forward the rich experience of guerrilla warfare in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and cooperate with the main force in the frontal battlefield. (4) Intensify the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, intensify industrial production, and enrich the material foundation for the self-defense war. We must all be prepared for a protracted war, carry forward the tenacious and arduous struggle spirit of the past eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, resist the offensive of Chinese fascism, and the final victory belongs to the people!
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 26th: Self-defense mobilization is active throughout Chahar Province. In Zhangyuan, Xuanhua, and other cities, thousands of workers and citizens' armed pickets patrol the urban areas day and night to assist the military police, protect the industrial areas and transportation lines. Transportation trade unions, rickshaw trade unions, and others have also jointly organized thousands of vehicles to rush ammunition and military supplies to the front lines. Democratic governments in various places have successively held air defense and poison gas defense training classes. More than 1,500 citizens in Xuanhua register to participate every day. A vast number of peasants are flocking to the self-defense battlefield like a tide. In Laiyuan, Yanqing, Longguan and other counties, more than 1,500 people have joined the main force. More than 10,000 militiamen have arrived in the border areas to participate in the war. The "Laiyuan Liberation Camp" organized by peasants in the Laishui area set off for the front lines amid the enthusiastic farewells of tens of thousands of liberated sisters. People in various counties in northern Sai are organizing local self-defense forces. In Wulahada Village, Chongli, more than ten boxes of explosives for mountain blasting that had been buried for more than ten years were handed over to the democratic government to manufacture landmines. Gentry Wu Shengming and others in Shangdu voluntarily donated a large number of rifles and hand grenades to the militia. He Village in Zhangbei has donated more than 30 fine horses to the militia.
