　　The most noteworthy international event of the past week has been Stalin's response to a British journalist's questions about the current situation.

　　In his reply, Stalin incisively exposed the war clamor being spread from Washington and Zurich and shattered the myths surrounding the atomic bomb, pointing out that these were deliberate acts of intimidation. Stalin said, "I do not believe in the 'actual danger' of a 'new war' (i.e., World War III)." This reflects his strong confidence in the power of the world's people to defend peace.

　　In his reply, Stalin also reiterated the possibility of peaceful cooperation between socialist and capitalist countries, and he specifically mentioned strengthening friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. He also said, "Communism is entirely possible in one country, especially in a country like the Soviet Union." If Stalin's statements are connected with the following events: Wallace's advocacy on the 14th for "peaceful coexistence between the US and the Soviet Union," Eden's appeal on the 23rd for a readjustment of the three-power relationship (especially the British-Soviet relationship), and the recent proposals from British diplomatic circles to consider the possibility of British-Soviet relations, the signing of the British-Soviet trade agreement, and Britain's disregard of the US in convening the Palestine conference, etc., it is not difficult to see that since February of this year, the US imperialism's particularly blatant anti-Soviet and expansionist policies have aroused serious domestic and international dissatisfaction and opposition. Currently, the call for three-power coordination, especially British-Soviet coordination, is becoming louder and louder. The speeches by Stalin, Wallace, and Eden are nothing less than a powerful counterattack against Benes' speech in Stuttgart and Churchill's speech in Zurich. Recently, after the British Foreign Secretary returned to Paris from London, he initiated the convocation of a Foreign Ministers' conference, at which it was decided that the peace conference should complete its work within a limited time, which may be a good omen for the peace conference to achieve some success.

　　In his reply, Stalin confirmed that the withdrawal of US troops from China is an urgent need for peace. At the same time, Gromyko formally condemned US interference in China's internal affairs at the Security Council, demanding that the US report on its troops stationed abroad. This is the first time the Soviet authorities have made such a statement. In the United States and Britain, Wallace's advocacy for foreign non-interference in China's internal affairs, and the London Observer believes that "the unrest in China, especially the war, is a potentially most dangerous area... the US military equipment of the government army to fight against the CCP is a fact known to the world." American progressive groups launched a "Withdraw from China Week" movement in thirty-five major cities; all this shows that the more actively American imperialism provides aid, the higher the tide of opposition to it rises throughout the world.

　　Civil war has broken out in Greece. Soon after the reactionary politicians rigged the popular will in the "re-election," they launched an armed attack on the areas occupied by the Northern National Liberation Front. The methods of the Greek reactionaries, and their inability to survive without foreign aid, are exactly the same as those of Chiang Kai-shek in China.

　　A wave of strikes is sweeping across countries. The strikes by Japanese railway workers and seamen have ended victoriously, the US maritime strike has also ended with partial victory, the French Ministry of Finance workers' general strike is expanding, and large-scale strikes in China and Burma have also begun.

　　国际一周
    过去一周中最引人注目的国际事件，是斯大林答复英记者关于时局的问题。
    斯大林在答复中一针见血的拆穿了从华盛顿和苏黎支散播出来的战争喧嚷，也粉碎了那些关于原子弹的神话，指出这些都是别具用心的恫吓行为。斯大林说：“我不相信‘新战争’（即第三次世界大战）的实际危险’”。“这反映他对于世界人民保卫和平的力量的坚强信心。
    斯大林在答复中又重申社会主义国家与资本主义国家和平合作的可能性，他特别提到了加强英苏两国之间的友好关系。他又说：“共产主义在一个国家内特别是在苏联这样的国家内是完全可能的。”把斯大林的这些主张和下列的事情联系起来，即华莱士十四日主张“美苏和平相处”，艾登二十三日呼吁重新调整三强关系（特别是英苏关系），以及英外交界最近主张考虑英苏关系的可能，英苏商约签订，英国不顾美国召开巴勒斯坦会议等等，就不难看到从今年二月以来美国帝国主义的特别露骨的反苏与扩张政策，已引起国内和国际间严重的不满和反对。目前三强协调特别是英苏协调的呼声愈来愈响，斯大林、华莱士、艾登的发言不啻是对贝纳斯在斯图加特和邱吉尔在苏黎支的演说之有力的反击。最近英外相自伦敦返巴黎后，发起召开外长会议，会中决定和会限期完成工作，这或者是和会达到若干成就的佳兆。
    斯大林在答复中确认美国部队从中国撤退乃和平之迫切需要，同时葛罗米柯在安理会上正式谴责美国干涉中国内政，要求美国报告其驻外军队。这在苏联当局声明中尚属首次。在美英等国里面，华莱士之主张外国不干涉中国内政，伦敦观察家认为：“在中国的不安特别是战争乃是潜在的最危险的地区……，政府军的美国军事装备对中共作战，已是举世皆知的事实。”美国进步团体在三十五个大城发动“退出中国周”运动；这一切都说明美帝国主义援助愈积极，全世界反对它的潮流就愈加高涨。
    希腊发生内战，反动政客在强奸民意的“复选”不久之后，即向北方民族解放阵线占领地区武装进攻，希腊反动派的手法与其一天没有外援就不能过日子的情况与中国的蒋介石如出一辙。
    罢工浪潮遍及各国，日本铁路工人与海员人罢工已胜利结束，美国海运大罢工亦部分胜利结束，法国财政部工人总罢工扩大，中国、缅甸大罢工亦已开始。
