　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Hanoi dispatch: Vietnam has established a ceasefire agreement. The agreement signed in Hanoi on the 27th stipulates that the Vietnamese Nationalist Party's troops will be incorporated into the Vietnamese government army led by the Viet Minh. Nationalist Party commanders will retain command of their troops under the leadership of the government. It is reported that the aforementioned war began on June 18th in northern Vietnam. With the help of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party attempted to forcibly overthrow the democratic government of various sectors of Vietnamese society, organized by the Viet Minh, while French forces launched new offensives against the Vietnamese army in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Cochinchina. However, under the counterattack of the Ho Chi Minh government, led by the Viet Minh, their plot ultimately failed.
