　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th: The Zhangjiakou Cooperatives have become an important organizer of citizen life. Currently, on average, one out of every four citizens is a member of a cooperative. Since this spring, the focus of the cooperative's business has shifted towards organizing citizen production. The city's street and village cooperatives have grown to 79, with capital and public reserve funds of nearly 10,000,000 yuan. There are 1,250 carpenters and tile workers. The old system of foreman contracting and exploitation has been abolished, and six carpentry and tile cooperatives have been established. In addition to soliciting public and private construction work, they also actively find ways to manufacture furniture for sale. The average worker's wage has increased to more than ten catties of wheat per day, and each dividend is around 50% of the wage. The threat of unemployment in winter and spring has also been avoided. For example, in the second, third, and seventh districts, rubber-wheeled cart owners have also organized transportation cooperatives, eliminating the exploitation of middlemen. Women in families in various streets have organized women's production cooperatives, lending out 30 wool spinning machines and organizing more than 180 women to spin wool, each earning more than 640 yuan per day. In addition, 873 women have sewn more than 10,000 cotton coats, earning more than 5,300,000 yuan in wages. Cooperatives organized by workers and poor people in various industries, such as flour making, shoe making, and sewing, are even more common. The municipal government recently issued 5,000,000 yuan in loans to support the cooperative cause and ordered all public enterprises in the city to sell daily necessities and raw materials to cooperatives at prices 5% to 10% lower than market prices.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 17th: The autumn harvest is a bumper crop throughout the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area. In the Hebei Central Plain, except for areas along the Hutuo and Daqing Rivers that suffered from floods, due to suitable spring and summer rainfall and the people's intensive farming, the crops are plump and strong. Yongqing and other places are expecting a full ten-year harvest. In western Hebei, such as Xingtang, Pingshan, Guanping, and Dingxian counties, the autumn fields are also extremely lush, with a harvest of 80% to 90% expected. Although the southern Chahar Plateau suffered from a spring famine, the wheat seedlings on the slopes were slightly affected, but in the irrigation areas along the Ping-Sui Railway, such as Sanggan and Yanghe, a bumper harvest can still be expected. In most areas of Xuanhua County, the rice ears are a foot long. According to experienced old farmers, ordinary silted land is expected to yield about two piculs and five dou per mu, an increase of one picul compared to before. In Changping and Huailai and other places in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, the general millet yield per mu has also increased by two to three dou compared to previous years. Farmers everywhere are happily reorganizing their work teams, repairing farm tools and warehouses, and preparing for the most pleasant harvest season of the year.

    【新华社张家口十七日电】晋察冀解放区全境秋禾丰登，冀中平原除沿滹沱、大清等河水患地区外，因春夏雨水适宜，加以群众精耕细作，作物粒穗硕壮，永清等地均足足十成年景，冀西行唐、平山、关平、定县等县，秋田亦极茂密，可望收获八九成。察南高原虽遭春荒，坡地禾苗略受影响，但平绥沿线桑干、洋河等灌溉区域，丰收仍可期望。宣化县大部地区谷穗盈尺，据有经验老农估计，普通淤地每亩可望收获两石五斗左右，较前增加一石，平绥东段昌平、怀来等地，一般黍谷每亩亦较往年增产二三斗，各地农民正喜洋洋地整顿拨工组，修理农具仓屯，迎接辛勤一年来最愉快地收获季节。
