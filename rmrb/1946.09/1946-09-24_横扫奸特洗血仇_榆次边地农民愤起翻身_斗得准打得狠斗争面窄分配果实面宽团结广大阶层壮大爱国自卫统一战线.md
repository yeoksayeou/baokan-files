　　Sweeping Away Traitors and Special Agents to Wash Away Blood Feuds
    Yuci Border Area Peasants Rise Up to Overthrow Their Oppressors
    Accurate Struggles, Fierce Blows, Narrow Scope of Struggle, Wide Distribution of Fruits, Unite Broad Sections of Society, Strengthen the Patriotic Self-Defense United Front
    [Report from our newspaper in Changzhi] Yuci is located at the triangular intersection of the Zhengtai and Tongpu Railways. For eight years, it has been occupied by the enemy and puppet regimes. Bunkers and pillboxes are scattered throughout the area, and roads are as dense as spiderwebs. The people have suffered greatly. After Japan surrendered last year, our army destroyed all the enemy and puppet strongholds and liberated the masses in the area. A movement to speak out about grievances and seek revenge was once launched, but soon after, Yan's puppet troops invaded Changning, and heavy troops were stationed in the city, making it a forward position for Yan's puppet regime to launch internal warfare and attack our area. For eight or nine years, the combination of the enemy, puppets, Yan's forces, traitors, special agents, and local tyrants and evil landlords have relentlessly oppressed and harmed the masses, creating a bloody feud for the 40,000 people of Yuci. In June of this year, after our army recovered Changning, followed by the victory of the Zhengtai Self-Defense War, it inspired the masses in the border area to launch a movement to oppose traitors and evil landlords, speak out about grievances, seek revenge, and overthrow their oppressors. After a short period of intensive training for active peasant elements in each village, the mass movement to overthrow oppressors has become like a fierce storm, settling nine years of blood debts, material debts, and money debts with traitors, special agents, and evil landlords. The flames of peasant grievances and revenge have been universally ignited in the countryside, reaching villages five or six miles away from the city and the railway line. Although Yan's puppet regime organized "revenge squads" to sabotage the overthrow movement, under our peasants' slogan of "armed self-defense and thorough overthrow," they fought while overthrowing their oppressors, achieving brilliant results. In the recent short period of twenty days, the entire border area, more than eighty villages, and over twenty thousand peasants have been swept into this earth-shaking movement. Fifteen thousand mu of land that had been plundered has been returned to the peasants, and the remaining forces of the enemy and puppet rule have been destroyed like fallen leaves swept away by the autumn wind. Now, they are quickly accelerating to further mobilize the masses. The main experience gained in the movement is: accurate struggles, fierce blows; narrow scope of struggle, wide distribution of fruits.
                                          (Xue Qiao, Jiang Feng, Ping Tao)
    [Another Dispatch] The Taihang Xinhua Daily specially published a short commentary calling on everyone to learn from Yuci's experience and emphasized the following two points, drawing everyone's attention: (1) To mobilize the masses in the border area, first understand the characteristics of the border area (the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets and the feudal ruling forces are strong, and the masses still lack the confidence and training to struggle), and boldly stir up a fierce storm of mass revenge and reckoning. Yuci's large-scale training of active elements and the willingness to work together, the rapid and fierce storm movement, is precisely the right medicine for recognizing the characteristics of the border area. If the remaining forces of the enemy and puppets and the feudal rulers are not given a severe "deterrent" with a storm-like movement, it will have little effect. Some places are secretly and painstakingly cultivating active elements one or two at a time, and then slowly "moving," thus showing powerlessness. (2) Doing a lot and doing it quickly has a principled difference from reckless action. Yuci, in the complex environment of the struggle between the stubborn puppets and us, grasped the principles of "accurate struggles, fierce blows" and "narrow scope of struggle, wide distribution of fruits." In the movement, it united broad sections of society, even middle and small landlords, strengthened the patriotic self-defense united front, and laid a favorable foundation for the patriotic self-defense war. This is completely different from the style of being timid and neglecting to unite the majority.

　　横扫奸特洗血仇
    榆次边地农民愤起翻身
    斗得准打得狠斗争面窄分配果实面宽团结广大阶层壮大爱国自卫统一战线
    【本报长治讯】榆次是正太、同蒲交点的三角地区，八年来久为敌伪盘踞，境内碉堡炮楼星罗棋布，公路密如蛛网，人民饱受灾难。去年日本投降后，我军将敌伪据点全部摧垮，解放该地群众，曾一度发动过诉苦复仇运动，但不久阎伪军又侵占我长凝，城内经常住有重兵，成为阎伪发动内战进攻我区的前哨阵地，八九年来的敌伪阎结合汉奸、特务、恶霸地主层层压榨残害群众，造成了榆次四万人民的血海深仇。今年六月，我军收复长凝后，接着正太自卫战争胜利，鼓舞边地群众掀起反奸反恶霸诉苦复仇翻身运动。经短期大量训练了各村积极层农民后，群众翻身斗争运动，已如疾风暴雨，向汉奸、特务、恶霸地主清算九年来的血债、物债、钱债。农民诉苦复仇的火焰，已在农村中普遍燃烧起来，直迫到离城和铁路线五六里的村庄。阎伪虽然组织“复仇队”破坏翻身运动，但在我农民“武装自卫彻底翻身”的口号下，一面翻身一面战斗，取得了辉煌成绩，在最近短短二十天光景，整个边地，八十多个村庄、二万余农民均卷入这一翻天复地的运动中，有一万五千亩被掠夺的土地重归农民，敌伪统治残余势力，已如秋风扫落叶被摧垮了。现正快马加鞭进一步发动群众。在运动中，得到的主要经验是：斗得准，打得狠；斗争面窄，分配果实面宽。
                                          （雪樵、江峰、平涛）
    【又讯】太行新华日报特著短论号召大家学习榆次经验，并强调提出以下两点，引起大家注意：（一）要想发动边地群众，首先认识边地特点（敌伪残余与封建统治势力强，群众还无斗争的信心与锻炼），大胆掀动群众复仇清算的疾风暴雨。榆次大量训练积极分子与要干一齐干，迅速猛烈的暴风雨运动，正是认识了边地特点的对症良药，如不以暴风雨的运动来给敌伪残余与封建统治者以“下马威”的严重打击，那是会沧海一粟效力不大的。有些地方在秘密的、手工业式的一个两个的培养积极分子，然后再慢腾腾的“运动”，因而就表现着无力。（二）大干快干，又与蛮干有原则的差别。榆次在顽伪我斗争复杂的环境中，掌握了“斗得准，打得狠”，“斗争面窄，分配果实面宽”的方针，在运动中团结了广大阶层，甚至中小地主，壮大了爱国自卫统一战线，打下了爱国自卫战争的有利基础，这与小手小脚但又忽视团结大多数的作风是迥然不同的。
