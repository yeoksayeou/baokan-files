Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: The United Press reports: The Paris Peace Conference tentatively set October 5th as the "target date" for the completion of the work of all committees yesterday, so that the conference itself can complete its work before October 23rd. According to this "target date," all committees should complete the review of all amendments and produce reports within the next four weeks, so that they can be passed at the plenary session of the Peace Conference, which will be held two and a half weeks before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Following the Fourth Foreign Ministers' Conference, the assistants to the foreign ministers met on the evening of the 9th to continue clearing amendments to the draft peace treaties in order to speed up the work of the Peace Conference. According to a British spokesman on the 9th, "The assistants to the foreign ministers have been able to make decisions on many amendments, but there is currently no direct need for the Big Four to handle these amendments." When the Italian Political Committee met on the 9th, a United Press reporter reported: "The assistants to the foreign ministers are trying to reach a consensus on the details of the proposals for the Italian-Yugoslav border and the boundary of the Free Territory of Trieste in secret meetings."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: United Press, Paris, September 7th reports: The "biggest problems currently under discussion at the Paris Peace Conference are the Trieste issue and certain economic clauses in the Italian treaty." The so-called certain economic clauses refer to Italy's reparations (or compensation for losses). The reparations issue is now the main topic of the Italian Economic Committee. This is one of the important issues on which the Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement. It is now submitted to the committee for discussion. There are twelve countries that are asking Italy for reparations (excluding the Soviet Union, as the issue of Italian reparations to the Soviet Union has been resolved), including Britain, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Abyssinia, Belgium, Poland, and Egypt. The total amount of reparations demanded exceeds two million million US dollars, of which more than one hundred million US dollars are demanded by Britain (11.5 billion dollars), Greece (6 billion dollars), Yugoslavia (1.3 billion dollars), and Albania (1 billion dollars). Britain's demand is the highest, exceeding half of the total amount. It can be seen that among the countries demanding reparations (or compensation), they can be divided into two categories. One category is typified by Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj pointed out on the 6th that Yugoslavia lost 170,000 people, 500,000 houses, 6 million horses and livestock, and 6 million sheep, etc., in the prisons of Italian aggression. The reparations demanded by Yugoslavia are only 1.3 billion dollars, which is only one-ninth of the damage suffered, and only equivalent to one-twentieth of the cost required for Italy to prepare for a war of aggression. The other category of those demanding reparations is typified by Britain. According to the Italian newspaper "Unita," the scale of compensation demanded by Britain is "equal to the financial income of Italy's sixteen budget years." Britain's demands have not only aroused complaints from the Italian side but also caused dissatisfaction from the United States, the latter opposing forcing Italy to pay excessive reparations.

　　巴黎和会加速进行
    定十月五日完成各委会工作
    英要求意大利赔款过苛
    【新华社延安十一日电】合众社报导：巴黎和会于昨日暂定十月五日为完成各委员会工作之“目标日期”，以便和会本身能在十月二十三日之前完成其工作。按照这一“目标期”，各委员会应于今后四周内完成审议一切修正案，并治成报告，以便在联合国大会开会前的二个半星期举行的和会全体大会上通过之。继第四次外长会议之后，各外长助理于九日晚聚会，继续清理各和约草案的修正案，以便加速和会工作。据英方发言人于九日宣称：“各外长助理对许多修正案已能作出决定，但目前并无直接必要让四强处理这些修正案。”当意大利政治委员会于九日开会时，合众社记者报导：“各外长助理力图在秘密会议中对意南边界以及的里雅斯特自由区疆界建议案之各细节求得一致意见。”
    【新华社延安十日电】合众社巴黎七日电称：巴黎和会“目前讨论中最大难题是的里雅斯特问题及意大利条约中的某些经济条款”。所谓某些经济条款，即指意大利的赔款（或损失赔偿）。赔款问题现在是意大利经济委员会的主要议题，这是外长会议未得协议的重要问题之一，现提交该委员会讨论，并要求意大利赔款的共有十二个国家，苏联除外，意对苏赔款问题已解决），其中有英、希、南、阿尔巴尼亚、阿比西尼亚、比、波、埃等国，要求赔款的总数超过二百万万美元，其中超过十万万美元者，计有英国（一百十五亿零二千万元）、希腊（六十亿元）、南斯拉夫（十三亿元）及阿尔巴尼亚（十亿元），英国之要求最高，超出总数之半。可以看出，在要求赔款（或赔偿）的国家中，可分为两类，一类以南斯拉夫为典型，南副总理卡德尔于六日指出：南斯拉夫在意大利的侵略牢狱中，损失了十七万人，五十万栋房屋，六百万匹马与家畜，六百万只羊等等。南斯拉夫所要求的赔款只十三万万元，只值所受损害的九分之一，仅相当于意国准备侵略战争所需费用的二十分之一。另一类要求赔款者以英国为典型，据意大利“团结”报载称：英国要求赔偿的规模，“等于意大利十六个预算年度的财政收入”，英国要求不仅引起意大利方面的怨言，且引起美国的不满，后者反对迫使意大利付出超乎寻常的赔款。
