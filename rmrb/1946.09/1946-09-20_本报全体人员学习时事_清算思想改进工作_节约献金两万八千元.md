　　The Entire Staff of This Newspaper Studies Current Affairs
    Cleanses Thoughts, Improves Work
    Saves 28,000 Yuan for Donations
    [This Newspaper] Following the Central Bureau's call to strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war and the "Liberation Daily's" editorial on crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, all comrades in this newspaper and the Xinhua Main and Branch Offices are studying with great enthusiasm to improve work efficiency, and are actively saving money to donate to support the front lines. In the study, the past empty debates were overcome, and the focus was on grasping the spirit and essence of the documents, reviewing past understandings of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, the analysis of forces, and the nature, purpose, and future development of the war, and clarifying the specific direction of future efforts. Many comrades have, based on the spirit of the documents, examined their past illusions about the United States and peace, the vacillation between left and right in the estimation of strength, and thoughts of quick victory and waiting for victory, and have formulated their own plans to improve work and increase work efficiency. Although some comrades in the editorial department are ill, and some are working while sick, they still try to find time to strengthen research. The news agency strives to speed up the work process, military news drafts are edited as soon as they arrive, and the editorial comrades often stay up late at night. The local group's output has doubled compared to the past, supplying the large demand for newspapers in the outer areas after the reduction of news. The business department and the general affairs section have studied and implemented many ways to save office expenses, and various departments have also automatically tightened the consumption of daily necessities. The distribution and transportation departments decided to speed up the delivery of letters and newspapers. Correspondent Zhao Qingshan promised that his delivery of letters would not only be fast, but also without errors or lost letters, and that all tasks would be done well. Recently, the club called for donations, and more than 28,000 yuan were donated within two days. Many comrades stated that they would not receive subsidies until the victory of the patriotic self-defense war.

　　本报全体人员学习时事
    清算思想改进工作
    节约献金两万八千元
    【本报讯】中央局争取爱国自卫战争胜利的号召及解放日报粉碎蒋介石进攻的社论发表后，本报及新华总分社全体同志正以高度热情进行学习，以提高工作效率，并纷纷节约献金支援前线。学习中克服了过去的空泛争论，而着重了掌握文件的精神实质，检讨过去对美国、对蒋介石、对力量分析，以及对战争性质、目的、发展前途等各方面的认识，明确今后具体努力方向。已有许多同志根据文件精神检讨出自己过去对美国、对和平的许多幻想，对力量估计上的忽左忽右，速胜思想与等待胜利思想等，并订出自己改进工作与提高工作效率的计划。编辑部虽有一部同志患病，并有的同志抱病工作，但仍设法争取时间加强研究，通讯社力求加速工作过程，军事报稿随到随编，编辑同志常深夜不眠，地方组产稿量较过去增加一倍，供应报纸在外区新闻减少后的大量需要；经理部与总务科研究实行了许多节省办公费的办法，各部门也自动紧缩日用品的消耗。发行交通部门，则决定加快送信送报。通信员赵清山保证自己送信不仅要快，而且要不出错，不丢信，办事都办好。最近俱乐部号召献金，两日内即献出两万八千多元。好些同志申明自己不领津贴，直到爱国自卫战争胜利。
