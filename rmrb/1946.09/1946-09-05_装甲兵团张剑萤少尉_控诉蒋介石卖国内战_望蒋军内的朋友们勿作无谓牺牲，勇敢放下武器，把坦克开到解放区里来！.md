    Lieutenant Zhang Jianying of the Armored Corps
    Denounces Chiang Kai-shek for Selling Out the Country and Starting a Civil War
    Calling on Friends within the Chiang Army Not to Make Meaningless Sacrifices, Bravely Lay Down Your Weapons, and Drive Your Tanks to the Liberated Areas!
    [Telegram from the Longhai Front, 3rd] Lieutenant Zhang Jianying of the 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment of the Training Column of the Armored Corps of the Kuomintang Army's Ministry of Military Affairs, who laid down his weapons in the Lanfeng battle, arrived in a certain liberated area on the 24th, driving a tank. He was warmly welcomed along the way. Although Lieutenant Zhang was wounded in his left arm, he was in high spirits. He told reporters in a solemn manner that he wanted to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of selling out the country and starting a civil war to the world as a Chinese citizen. He said: During the most difficult time of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek used sixteen armored companies distributed in a horseshoe-shaped encirclement line from Suiyuan in the north, to Jiuquan, Gansu in the west, to Xi'an in the south, and to Zhengzhou in the east, echoing the Japanese invaders to encircle and block the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and cut off its connection with the liberated areas behind enemy lines. Lieutenant Zhang said indignantly that in the late summer of the 27th year, he had driven this giant "569" tank in a battle against the Japanese Kou (invaders) Toihara in Lanfeng. At that time, he was just thinking of contributing more strength, but Chiang Kai-shek transferred him to the west bank of the Yellow River to encircle the liberated areas. After Japan surrendered, not only was there no opportunity to disarm the Japanese invaders, but on the contrary, he was forced to cooperate with the enemy to attack the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, who had contributed to the War of Resistance! Lieutenant Zhang continued in an excited tone: "When the battle started on the evening of the 10th, the shells were already loaded on the projectile rack, but I lost the courage I had when fighting Toihara!" At this time, under the fierce artillery fire, a shell on the projectile rack was hit, and two platoon leaders died from their serious injuries, and Lieutenant Zhang's left arm was also injured by shrapnel. In order to mourn the meaningless sacrifice of many old friends and to end his own tragic experience, Lieutenant Zhang made up his mind to let this "569" giant tank lie there quietly, waiting for the arrival of the Eighth Route Army. Finally, the moment of liberation came. Lieutenant Zhang jumped out of the tank, handed his pistol to the Eighth Route Army who came to the vehicle, bandaged his wounds, and sat back in his tank. "At this time, I don't know what kind of power it was," Lieutenant Zhang said, "that made me completely forget the pain and happily stepped on the accelerator and advanced towards the liberated area." On the way, he and his companions were chased by airplanes and more than a thousand Chiang's puppet troops, but they finally broke through the encirclement and arrived victoriously in the democratic and free liberated area. Finally, Lieutenant Zhang said very frankly: "I have now made up my mind to do my best for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland with my conscience! If Chiang Kai-shek continues to fight the civil war, I will give him a head-on blow!" Finally, Lieutenant Zhang and others asked the reporter to convey their meaning to their classmates and friends who remained in the Chiang's army, not to make meaningless sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek's sale of the country and civil war, disarm the tanks, and bravely drive them to the liberated areas.

　　装甲兵团张剑萤少尉
    控诉蒋介石卖国内战
    望蒋军内的朋友们勿作无谓牺牲，勇敢放下武器，把坦克开到解放区里来！
    【陇海前线三日电】在兰封战斗中放下武器的国民党军政部装甲兵团教导纵队二团一营一连张剑萤少尉等，已于二十四日驾驶坦克车到达解放区某地。沿途备受欢迎。张少尉虽左臂负伤，精神仍极焕发，他以严正态度向记者表示，他要以中国人民的资格，向全世界控诉蒋介石卖国内战的罪行。他说：在抗战最艰苦的时候，蒋介石以十六个装甲兵连分布在北起绥远，西至甘肃、酒泉，南达西安，东至郑州的马蹄形包围线上，与日寇互相呼应包围封锁陕甘宁边区，并割裂其与敌后各解放区的联系。张少尉很激愤地说，他二十七年夏末，曾驾驶着这辆“五六九”号的巨型坦克，在兰封和日寇土肥原打过一仗，那时正想多出一番力量，却被蒋介石调到黄河西岸去包围解放区了。日本投降后不仅没有机会去解除日寇的武装，相反地却被迫和敌人配合进攻抗战有功的八路军、新四军！张少尉以激动的语调继续说：当十日晚开始战斗时，炮弹已经装在弹架子上，可是我却失去当年打土肥原时的勇气了！”这个时候在剧烈的炮火下，弹架上的一颗炮弹被打着了，两个排长因负伤过重而死去，张少尉的左臂也被弹片创伤了。为着悼念多年老友的无谓牺牲和结束自己悲惨的遭遇，张少尉下定决心，让这辆“五六九”号巨型坦克静静地躺在那里，等待着八路军的到来。终于解放的时刻来到了，张少尉从坦克里跳出来，把手枪交给来到车前的八路军，包扎好伤口，又重新坐上他的坦克。“这时候不知有一股什么样的力量，”张少尉说：“使我完全忘掉了伤痛，轻松愉快地开足了马力，向解放区前进。”途中，他和他的伙伴们，曾遭到飞机和一千多蒋伪军的追击，但是他们终于冲出了重围，胜利地抵达了民主自由的解放区。最后，张少尉很直率地说：“我现在已经下定决心，要凭着自己的良心，为祖国的独立、和平、民主，尽最大的努力！如果蒋介石还要继续打内战，我要给他一个迎头痛击！”最后张少尉等并请记者把他们的意思传达给他们留在蒋军中的同学和朋友们，不要为蒋介石卖国内战作无谓的牺牲，把坦克车解除了武装，勇敢地开到解放区里来。
