Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 6th. After Chiang's troops occupied Faku and other places, unripe crops within two li on both sides of the Xinmin-Faku highway were forcibly harvested, and exorbitant taxes became even heavier. The tax for each livestock is 1,000 yuan. An old farmer bought 500 yuan of onion seedlings, but was robbed of 1,060 yuan in vehicle and horse tax. Chiang's police and secret agents arbitrarily confiscated money and goods from passing merchants in the name of "Eighth Route Army spies." A prison from the time of the enemy and puppet occupation in the city called "Detention Center" now holds more than 100 innocent residents. Officers of the 6th Division of Chiang's 71st Army can arbitrarily write notes to stores to demand money. When the Democratic Allied Army was suppressing bandits, Chiang's troops relieved them, and brought the wounded bandit leaders into the city for treatment. Currently, 124 people near Faku have been forced to take up arms for self-defense.

　　蒋家苛政能延几时？侵陷区人民揭竿愤起
    国民党军勾结胡匪法库人民武装自卫
    【新华社齐齐哈尔六日电】蒋军占领法库等地后，沿新民至法库公路两旁二里内尚未成熟的庄稼均被迫割完，苛捐杂税更为繁重。每匹牲口交税一千元。一老乡买了五百元葱秧，却被抢抽一千零六十元的车马捐。蒋记警察特务任意以“八路军探子”名义没收过往商旅钱物，城内有一个敌伪占领时的监狱叫做“留置场”，现在监禁在那里的无辜居民即达百余人。蒋军七十一军第六师军官可以任意写条子到商店要钱。民主联军进剿胡匪时，蒋军为其解围，并将负伤匪首，接入城内医治，现法库附近已有一百二十四人被逼拿起武器自卫。
