　　A Chiang Army Battalion Commander's Diary
　　Editor's Note: Our army captured the diary of a battalion commander of the 78th Regiment, 26th Brigade, 49th Division of the Kuomintang army (formerly Battalion Commander of the 3rd Battalion, 78th Regiment, 26th Division, 49th Army) during the Rugao Self-Defense War. The diary spans from the New Year's Address of 1946 to July 15th. Excerpts are published below:
　　January 21st (Sunny)
　　If the ideology of the general officers lacks goals and a center, morale will not be high. Speaking for myself, will I be studying at the Army University in the next six months? Will I continue to work? Or will I take off my military uniform? I can't see it myself. If a person's future has no hope, of course he will be disheartened.
　　February 5th, Changzhou.
　　The Ta Kung Pao's editorial is "Rescuing Teachers," which says that teachers' lives cannot be sustained, so they are changing careers one after another. This leads me to think about the treatment of soldiers and their future. Victorious soldiers not only do not enjoy anything, but they cannot even maintain the lowest standard of living. The most miserable people in society are the soldiers (referring to Chiang's army soldiers). They only have obligations and no rights. I cannot stop the soldiers from deserting. Standing from the soldiers' point of view, I am unwilling to add an "unwarranted" crime to the deserters.
　　February 21st (Sunny) Mazhuang.
　　Since February, I have felt uneasy. The Northeast issue is tense, and I am not sure whether the troops will move. Economically, I have already accumulated a debt of 520,000 yuan, which makes me very worried. At the same time, I think of the country's meager treatment of soldiers and the lack of security for the future, which is really frightening. Moreover, the Kuomintang-Communist issue has not been resolved. Once I am transferred north to fight, what will people think?
　　March 7th (Sunny) Jijiacun.
　　I got up in the morning with nothing to do and did not go out. I was quite bored, so I wrote a letter home, stating that I was discouraged and disheartened with military life, and especially hoped for a letter from home.
　　After breakfast, I went to the regimental headquarters and talked with the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander about the issue of the future. We all felt discouraged. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) The treatment is too meager, and the current living conditions cannot be maintained. (2) There is no security for the future. For example, the division commander's education and qualifications have always been admired by us, but after being "commended," he was suddenly ordered to be transferred to the Senior Staff of the Xuzhou Pacification Office, which serves as a lesson for us. (3) Life is too boring. (4) It is extremely difficult to lead troops. Senior officers do not know how to care for the soldiers. (5) No consideration is given to any execution from above, only good is allowed, and bad is not.
　　March 13th, Daijiacun.
　　The salary increase issue has been changed to start on April 1st, but the reorganization time has arrived, but there is no new news, which makes people suspicious and uneasy. Recently, due to the reporting of retirement matters, various units have requested to retire. This phenomenon is indeed caused by the country's extensive army and administrative disorder. Some soldiers have been in the army for more than ten years. Seeing that they do not know when their service will end, they have requested to retire one after another.
　　March 20th (Sunny) Daijiacun.
　　Today, I continued to play mahjong. Because I didn't sleep all night, everyone's faces were pale and ugly. After the mahjong game, we talked about the future of soldiers, but the more we talked, the more disappointed we became. I didn't go back to the camp until after 12 o'clock.
　　April 14th, Laojiacun.
　　The regimental commander announced that he had received a phone call from the army commander saying that the puppet army Guan Xiwu's unit would be allocated to each regiment. This regiment was allocated two companies and ordered to maintain its establishment. In other words, this regiment must disperse two companies. This matter is probably the upper-level's intention to prevent the unit from being incorporated by the Communist army, so they came up with this method. From this, we can see the darkness of the Kuomintang.
　　May 9th (Cloudy)
　　In the evening, the old battalion commander invited me and Jinghe to go to the hotel to have fun. The intention was self-evident. After we arrived at the hotel, the waiter immediately led three prostitutes to come. Because I always felt that doing this was too unfair to my father, brothers, and sisters, although I slept with a prostitute who was accustomed to a life of physical labor all night, nothing happened.
　　June 15th, Shengpu.
　　As soon as I walked into the camp headquarters, I saw a group of soldiers punching and kicking each other in a fight. Gunner Xu Qing told me that the soldiers were fighting because of gambling. When I approached, they all slipped away one by one, and no one could be caught. I was extremely angry and immediately assembled the soldiers for a lecture, and immediately investigated those who were gambling. Soon after, someone said that ××× was one of them. I beat the soldier severely, and he admitted it, but my hand was also cracked by the wooden stick, and I couldn't even hold a pen when I returned to the room.
　　July 5th (Cloudy) Shengpu.
　　The superiors forced us to prepare to attack. We had to attack blindly. We didn't know anything, so how could we talk about victory?

　　一个蒋军营长的日记
    编者按：我军于如皋自卫战中缴获国民党军第四十九师二十六旅七十八团一个营长的日记（原四十九军二十六师七十八团三营营长）自一九四六年元旦献词起，至七月十五日止，兹摘要发表如下：
    元月二十一日  （晴）
    一般干部的思想没有目标和中心，士气就不会旺盛，以我自己来说，我在今后半年之内是到陆大读书？是继续干下去？还是把军装脱掉？自己也看不出来。一个人的前途没有希望，当然是丧气了。
    二月五日，常州。
    大公报的社论是《抢救教师》，内容是说教师生活不能维持，故纷纷改业，因此联想到军人的待遇问题，和前途问题。胜利的军人不但没有得到享受，而且却连最低生活都不能维持。社会上最苦的就是士兵（指蒋军士兵），他们只有义务，而无任何权利，我对士兵的逃亡是无法制止的。站在军人的立场，我不愿意给逃亡士兵加上一个“莫须有”的罪名。
    二月二十一日（晴）马庄。
    二月来，内心颇感不安，东北问题紧张，部队是否移动不敢肯定，经济方面计算起来，已负债五十二万元，颇使人忧虑，同时想到国家对军人的薄待，前途的无保障，实令人惶恐。况国共问题亦未解决，一旦北调作战，又将令人作何感想？
    三月七日（晴）戢家村。
    晨起无事，未外出，颇为无聊，乃提笔写家书一封，述对军人生活已灰心丧气，尤盼家中来信。
    早饭后往团部一走，与团长副团长谈及前途问题，均感灰心，其原因不外下端：（一）待遇太薄，目前生活现状均不能维持。（二）前途无保障，如师长之学历资历一向为余等羡慕，然“嘉奖”之后，忽奉令调任徐州绥靖公署高级参谋，于斯给吾人以前车之鉴。（三）生活太枯燥。（四）带兵极感困难，上级官长不知体恤士兵。（五）对任何之执行上面不加考虑，只准好，不准坏。
    三月十三日，戴家村。
    加薪问题改为四月一日起，但整编时间已到，却未闻有新消息，颇使人怀疑不安，近日因报退役公事，各单位纷纷请求退伍，似此现象，确为国家兵广，行政之紊乱所致，士兵入伍至现在有达十余年者，因见服役不知终于何年何月，故纷纷请求退役。
    三月二十日（晴）戴家村。
    本日仍继续雀牌战，因彻夜不眠，每个人脸色都苍白难看，牌战毕又谈军人出路问题，但愈谈则愈失望。直到十二时后才匆匆回营。
    四月十四日，老家村。
    团长宣布奉军长电话将伪军关锡五部分拨与各团，本团分拨两个连，并令保持其建制，换言之，即本团须拨散两个连，此事盖上级之用意恐该部被共军收编故出此手段，于此可见国民党之黑暗。
    五月九日（阴）
    晚间老营长邀余与静和去旅社作乐，斯意不言即明，余等至旅社后，茶房即引三个妓女前来，余因始终觉得这样做，太对不起父兄姐妹，所以虽然与惯操肉体生涯的妓女在一起睡了一夜，却没有发生关系。
    六月十五日，盛蒲。
    刚走进营部见一批士兵磨拳擦掌的在打吵，手枪兵许青告诉我，那些士兵是因为赌博而打起架来，我走近时，一个个都溜走了，谁也捉不到，我气极了，马上集合士兵训话，并当场追究那些人赌博，不久之后，便有人说×××是其中一个、我将该兵毒打了一顿，他承认了，但我的手亦被木棍震的欲裂，回到房里执笔也不能了。
    七月五日，（阴）盛蒲。
    上级迫令我们准备攻击，我们只得盲目的攻，什么都不知道，怎能谈得上胜利。
