　　Zaozhuang Uncovers KMT Spy Case
    Using the Residence of US Representatives to Secretly Hide Weapons
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 16th] The Zaozhuang Municipal Democratic Government Public Security Bureau has uncovered a Kuomintang (KMT) spy case and seized firearms and a large sum of cash. The main culprit is Wang Chongyun, the Chinese cook of the US personnel of the Zaozhuang Executive Headquarters. After the New Fourth Army liberated Zaozhuang on June 10th, KMT spies secretly organized underground activities, using the residence of the US representatives of the Zaozhuang Executive Headquarters to secretly hide firearms, plotting to create riots and assassinations. After a long period of investigation, the local Public Security Bureau arrested the main perpetrator a few days ago. According to the confessions of the perpetrator Wang Chongyun and a female sorcerer (the third concubine of Wang Wang, Chief of Staff of the Chiang Army's 19th Army Group, who was captured when the New Fourth Army liberated Zaozhuang and left a note in mid-August and fled), "they were instructed by the Kuomintang authorities in Xuzhou to carry out intelligence work and, when the opportunity arose, arrange assassination activities." After the case was uncovered, the Public Security Bureau, together with Mr. Swaki of the US team, escorted the main perpetrator to the basement of the US representative's residence, where they found two Mauser pistols and forty rounds of ammunition, as well as 600,000 yuan of special agent activity funds provided by the Chiang side. The CCP representative of the Twelfth Executive Headquarters has officially notified Mr. Austermeier, the US representative, of the whole case.
