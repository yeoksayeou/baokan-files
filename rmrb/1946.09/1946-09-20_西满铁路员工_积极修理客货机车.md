　　Western Manchuria Railway Employees
    Actively Repair Passenger and Freight Locomotives
    [Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 17th] Railway employees under the Western Manchuria Railway Bureau, under the call of the trade union, have launched an enthusiastic work competition to actively repair vehicles and locomotives to ensure winter railway transportation. Since September 1st, the work speed in the initial stage of the competition has greatly increased. The sand casting factory melted two tons and thirty-four pounds of copper in three hours, exceeding the highest record of melting three tons of copper in twelve hours during the puppet Manchukuo period by more than two times. Hao Wenzhang, a worker in the Nankuang Factory workshop, can make four reverse hook bars a day, whereas in the past he could only produce one a day. The employees are busy repairing passenger and freight cars. Many badly damaged vehicles will come out of the factory brand new in just three to five days, one after another. The factory plans to repair 40 freight cars and 31 passenger cars in September. The workers have expressed that they will exceed the plan. Due to the offensive of the reactionaries, raw materials are very difficult to obtain, but thanks to the workers' use of waste materials and creation of new substitutes, the problem has been solved.

    积极修理客货机车
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十七日电】西满铁路局所属铁路员工在工会号召下，掀起热烈工作竞赛，积极修理车辆和机车，保证冬季铁路交通，自九月一日起，竞赛初期工作速度大为提高，翻沙厂在三小时内化铜两吨零三十四斤，超过伪满时十二小时化铜三吨之最高记录二倍以上，南匡厂工房工友郝文章一天可作成逆钩棒四根，过去一天才能出产一根。员工们正忙着修客货车，许多破坏不堪的车辆，只须三五天后即崭新地一辆一辆的走出工厂，该厂九月份计划修理好四十辆货车三十一辆客车工友们表示要超过计划。由于反动派的进攻，原料非常困难，但赖工友利用废物，创造新代用品，得以解决。
