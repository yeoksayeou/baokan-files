　　After a 150-person "Turning Over" team arrived in the Sha area on the border of Yundong En and Xia in July, they initially hesitated to fully mobilize the masses, restricting their actions. Some local tyrants and landlords intimidated the masses and bribed bad elements to infiltrate and sabotage. The masses were afraid we wouldn’t carry things through to the end and were hesitant to act. As a result, for more than a month, the work was stuck on fact-finding. After the new spirit of the District Party Committee regarding boldly mobilizing the masses was conveyed, the comrades in the work team studied it and emphasized the principle of mobilizing the masses based on their opinions. The cadres immediately integrated with the masses, sparking an enthusiastic "Turning Over" struggle. The feudal fortresses in more than twenty villages, including Youzhuang, Zhongzhengzhuang, Xiaolichangtun, and Daxing, were broken through one after another. More than twenty people, including the leading traitors and local bullies Li Zhendong, Li Fangtai, Li Fangyu, and Li Maozhu, were overthrown by the masses. The masses poured out their bitterness, settled accounts for blood debts, and established peasant associations and militia. Now, the leadership is further emphasizing the principle of "boldly and freely mobilizing the masses." The masses and activists in the advanced villages are in high spirits and are helping to mobilize the backward villages.

　　[Report from this newspaper, Handan, 2nd] Recently, Qiao Mingli, Commander of the Democratic Nation-Building Army, sent a letter to the Shahe Fourth District "Turning Over" Cadre Conference, supporting the mass "Turning Over" movement and congratulating the conference on its success. The original letter stated: "Currently, a very enthusiastic 'Turning Over' movement has been launched everywhere. I hope everyone will boldly and freely mobilize the masses. Our army is willing to do everything possible to support the 'Turning Over' of the masses." The letter also expressed the hope that the army’s existing phenomenon of being divorced from the masses would be criticized, stating: "We especially welcome criticism from the masses. We have enough courage to accept everyone's criticism and enough determination to correct our shortcomings; only in this way can our army gradually become the people's army."

    【本报威县一日电】一百五十人的翻身大队于七月到达运东恩、夏边界的沙区后，开始时因为不肯放手，束缚了群众的手足，而一些恶霸地主恫吓群众，并收买一些坏人混到群众里，进行破坏。群众怕我们干不到底，就不敢行动。结果，一个多月的时间，工作总停留在了解情况上。区党委关于放手发动群众的新精神传达后，工作队同志作了研究，强调提出根据群众意见发动群众的方针，干部立即与群众结合起来，掀起了热烈的翻身斗争。尤庄、种正庄、萧里长屯、大兴二十多个村的封建堡垒，先后被冲破了，汉奸恶霸头子李振东、李芳泰、李芳玉、李茂竹等二十多人，都被群众斗倒了。群众倒出了苦水，清算了血债，建立了农会与民兵。现在领导上更强调提出“大胆放手发动群众”的方针，先进村的群众与积极分子情绪极高，正在帮助发动落后村。
    【本报邯郸二日讯】日前民主建国军乔明礼军长致函沙河四区翻身干部大会，支援群众翻身运动，祝贺大会胜利成功。原函内称：“目前各地已展开极热烈的翻身运动，希望大家放手大胆的发动群众，敝军愿尽一切可能的力量来支援群众的翻身”。函中并希望对该军尚存在的脱离群众现象予以批评，据称：“群众的批评我们尤其欢迎，我们有足够的勇气接受大家的批评，也有足够的决心改正自己的毛病；只有这样才能使敝军逐渐成为人民的军队。”
