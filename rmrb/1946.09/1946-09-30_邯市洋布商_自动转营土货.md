　　Handan Foreign Cloth Merchants
　　Voluntarily Switch to Domestic Goods
    [This newspaper, Handan Dispatch] Foreign goods merchants in this city cherish the liberated areas and respond to the call to advocate the use of domestic goods, actively requesting to change trades. Twenty foreign cloth stores, under the leadership of Mr. Wang Moqing of the association, have already seen twelve stores switch trades, and the rest are also planning to do so. As Director Tian of the Timber Industry Association said, "Although operating domestic goods is temporarily less profitable, everyone is willing to do it to cherish the liberated areas." Through everyone's efforts, most of the goods in the city's market have become domestic goods.

　　邯市洋布商
　　自动转营土货
    【本报邯郸讯】本市洋货商人爱护解放区，响应倡用国货的号召，纷纷自动要求转业。二十家洋布店，在该会王墨卿先生领导下，已十二家转业，其余亦正筹划中。正如木业公会田主任说：“虽然经营土货一时利小，为了爱护解放区，谁也愿意。”经过大家的努力，本市市场上大部货物已变成土货。
