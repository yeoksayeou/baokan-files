(By Our Newspaper) Bo'ai County trained a thousand village cadres and peasant association activists in two sessions from late July to mid-August, in order to realize "land to the tiller" and enable peasants to completely overturn the feudal rule. They summarized the past experience of struggle to overturn the old order and resolved several ideological problems. A brief introduction is as follows:

	I. Having Land Means Thoroughly Overturning the Old Order – At the beginning, everyone thought that since rent had been reduced, there were no more bandits, the common people became cadres, and they dared to speak, "Our village has overturned the old order by eighty or ninety percent!" Some who thought it hadn't been thoroughly overturned only said that there were still some traitors and local bullies who hadn't been struggled against, or that the fruits of struggle hadn't been divided. Later, the question was raised: what exactly constitutes a thorough overturning of the old order? After heated discussion, everyone finally agreed that the primary standard should be "having enough to eat and wear, and having land to cultivate." The village chief of the next term said, "Land is a treasure bowl, with land, you don't have to worry about anything!" Everyone examined their past experiences of being exploited by high rents and heavy interest, and some worked as laborers for others, because they had lost their land. The reason landlords could suck blood and oppress people was because they had seized the land. Later, the discussion turned to who the land should belong to. Everyone felt that the land was reclaimed by the farmers, and the grain was grown by the farmers. "Hundreds of millions of people in the world, no one can do without farmers." "The working people are the living gods of wealth," so the land should belong to the farmers.

	II. Middle and Poor Peasants are One Family, Unity is Strength – At the beginning, everyone had the idea of "cutting leeks," thinking that one group would be struggled against after another, and it would be the middle peasants' turn eventually. Later, the question was raised, "What is the struggle for?" Everyone said it was for land. But, "The land is in the hands of the landlords, what's the point of struggling against the middle peasants?" Later, there was a discussion about the situation of middle peasants being exploited and oppressed in feudal society, and the proportion of middle peasants in the countryside was calculated, and everyone's thinking was cleared. Everyone unanimously recognized that "poor and middle peasants are one family, unity is strength," not only must they unite to struggle against landlords and local bullies, but also unite to consolidate the victory of the struggle. Someone then mentioned that bad middle peasants should be struggled against, but after discussion, everyone also understood the principle that "except for heinous traitors, local bullies, and black gun rulers, generally, everyone should be cleaned up and no one should touch their property."

	III. Regarding the mistakes of village cadres, everyone believed that they should be dealt with separately. The worst should be replaced (such as those who consistently sheltered landlords and local bullies and still have difficulty awakening even after education), and the general ones can be educated and enlightened to awaken them, and then they can automatically admit their mistakes to the masses and correct them (such as those who distributed too much of the fruits of struggle or have a bad work style). Their past contributions should be praised and cherished, and they should be encouraged to correct their mistakes from a positive perspective.

	IV. Redemption of land and reversal of property should be aimed at local bully landlords, and should not be done randomly, dividing the ranks of the middle and poor peasants.

	V. In the cities, the principle of "not attacking industry and commerce, only attacking traitors and local bullies and implementing rent reduction and interest reduction" should be grasped. The struggle to reduce rent should also first look at who the landlord is, and then decide what to do and to what extent.

	Finally, everyone discussed what to do after returning. Everyone unanimously decided to first quickly sort out the fruits of past struggles, immediately conduct an audit of labor service accounts, transfer burden accounts, and some will thoroughly implement reversing rents and interest, accusing and liquidating traitors and local bullies. Everyone's emotions were extremely high. Activists in Baishan Village woke up in the middle of the night and were still discussing ways to mobilize the majority of the masses and liquidate, determined to realize "land to the tiller" and completely overturn the old order.

　　明确翻身翻透思想
    博爱县集训积极分子
    获得土地是翻身的首要标准
    中贫农团结翻了身才能巩固
    【本报讯】博爱为实现耕者有其田，使农民从封建统制下彻底翻身，于七月下旬至八月中，先后两次集训村干部与农会积极分子千人，总结过去翻身斗争经验，解决了若干思想问题，特简要介绍如下：
    一、有了土地才算翻透身——开始时，大家都认为租子减啦，没土匪啦，老百姓当了干部啦，敢说话啦“俺村翻身翻的八八九九啦！”有认为没翻透的，也只是说还有些汉奸恶霸没斗，或斗争果实没分。后来提出究竟怎样才算翻透身，经过热烈讨论，最后一致认为首要的标准应该是“有吃有穿而且有地种。”下期城村长说：“土地就是聚宝盆，有了地就啥也不愁啦！”大家都检讨到过去受高租重利盘剥，有的给人家当雇工，原因就是失掉了土地。地主们所以能吸血，压迫人，就因为掠得了土地。以后又讨论土地应该是谁的？大家都觉得地是庄稼人开出来的，粮食是庄稼人种的，“天下人民千千万，谁也离不了庄稼汉”。“劳动人民是活财神”，所以土地应该是农民的。
    二、中农贫农是一家，团结起来力量大——开始时大家有“割韭菜”思想，认为是斗了一茬斗一茬，轮到中农也得斗争。后来提出“斗争为啥”，大家说是为了土地。但是，“土地在地主手里，斗争中农干啥？”后来又讨论到中农在封建社会里受剥削压迫的情形，计算了中农在农村中占的比重，大家思想通了。一致认识到“贫农中农是一家，团结起来力量大”，不仅要联合起来向地主恶霸斗争，而且要联合起来巩固斗争胜利，又有人提到坏中农该斗，但经讨论后，大家也弄通了“除罪大恶极的汉奸恶霸黑枪统治者外，一般都应该洗脸擦黑，不动他财产”的原则。
    三、对村干部的错误，大家认为应该分别处理。最坏的撤换（如一贯包庇地主恶霸经过教育仍难一时觉悟的），一般的经教育启发其觉悟后，可自动向群众认错改过（如多分斗争果实与作风不好的），要表扬与珍贵他们过去的功劳，从积极方面鼓励其改正错误。
    四、赎地倒产，应该面向恶霸地主，不应乱赎乱倒，分裂中贫农自己阵营。
    五、城市中掌握“不打击工商业，只打击汉奸恶霸及实行减租减息”的原则。减房租斗争也要先看房东是什么人，然后决定怎样做，做到什么程度。
    最后，大家讨论回去以后怎样做。一致决定先将过去斗争果实迅速清理一下，马上进行算劳役账，转嫁负担账，还有的要彻底实行倒租息，向汉奸恶霸控诉与清算等。大家情绪极高。柏山村积极分子半夜醒来还在讨论发动大多数群众与清算的办法，决心要实现耕者有其田，彻底翻身。
