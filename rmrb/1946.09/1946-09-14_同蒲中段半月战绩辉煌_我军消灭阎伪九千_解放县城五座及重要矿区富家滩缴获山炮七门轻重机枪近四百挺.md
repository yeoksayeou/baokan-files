　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng on the 8th] The patriotic self-defense campaign in the mid-segment of the Tongpu Railway Line, which shook the entire Tongpu line, swept through the five cities of Hongdong, Huo County, Zhaocheng, Lingshi, and Fenxi, and the famous coal mine of Fu (formerly mistakenly written as傅) jiatan in two weeks, along with 52 villages and strongholds, capturing and killing or wounding approximately 9,000 people. The details of the campaign are reported as follows: Just as the Chiang troops invading southern Shanxi were concentrating their forces on the 12th of last month to advance towards Dongzhen and Houma, the Yan's puppet troops in Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Huo County, Lingshi, Fenxi, Jiexiu, Pingyao, and other places in the mid-segment of the Tongpu Railway, in coordination with the Chiang troops from the north and south, concentrated their forces to invade in all directions. Initially, the entire three regiments of the 69th Division in Huo County, led by Division Commander Zhou Jianshe, advanced towards Liujiazhuang and other places east of Huo County on the 13th in eight routes, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Eighth Route Army in the area in one fell swoop, and then advance along Huo County towards Zhaocheng and Hongdong. The local soldiers and civilians had no choice but to launch a self-defense counterattack, engaging in bloody battles with the three regiments of the 69th Division on a 20-li front, using patriotic zeal and courageous charges to break through the encirclement. They annihilated the entire 207th Regiment of the division and inflicted losses on the other two regiments. In order to completely shatter the conspiracy of the Chiang-Yan troops to attack from the north and south, the Eighth Route Army, starting from the battle of Liujiazhuang, launched self-defense counterattacks towards Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Huo County. On the 120-li patriotic self-defense front, the Eighth Route Army fought alongside 200,000 people, first surrounding the outer strongholds of the three counties, such as Jiacun, Libao, and Yufeng Mountain in Hongdong, Houcun, Motou Station, and Sunbao in Zhaocheng, and Xinzhi Station, Bailong Village, Dazhang, and Zhao Village in Huo County. The counterattack of the Hongdong troops came first. After capturing the Yufeng Mountain stronghold, they besieged Hongdong City. The puppet County Chief Zhang Conglong could not hold on and fled in panic, only to be killed outside the South Gate. Following Hongdong, Zhaocheng, known as the "land fortress," although its outer bunkers were numerous and very solid, could not stop the invincible Eighth Route Army and the power of the people. After two days, they separately recovered the strongholds of Motou Station, Sunbao, etc., and immediately besieged the city gate. The remnants of the 69th Division of Fenxi rushed to reinforce them day and night, but were blocked on the west bank of the Fen River. On the 18th, the Yan troops in the city attempted to break out and escape to the west, but were annihilated at the Fen River. The Chief of Staff of the 39th Division defending the city was captured on the banks of the Fen River. After being blocked, the 69th Division retreated in a hurry and was pursued and annihilated by our army, losing a battalion. When our army heavily besieged Huo County, Yan Xishan and Sun Chu sent several telegrams to Qi Xiankong, the Commissioner of Huo Prefecture, and Xu Ziliang, the commander defending the city, ordering them to hold Huo County to the death, waiting for reinforcements, and offering rewards of 700,000 and 5 million yuan to encourage the defense of the city. However, the brave soldiers of the Eighth Route Army captured the cement bunkers of Huo County in just 30 minutes, liberating three cities in seven days. After entering the city, the troops were disciplined and did not violate the people's property. Residents and merchants welcomed them on both sides of the road. On the 26th, the Eighth Route Army and hundreds of thousands of people launched self-defense counterattacks towards Fenxi, Nanguan, Fujiatan, Lingshi, Suozhou Town, Lengquan, and a line of county towns and village strongholds. Yan Xishan had built new-style cement and steel-reinforced bunkers in the 40-li area from Fujiatan to Lingshi. In particular, Fujiatan and Lingshi were very strongly fortified. First, our army captured the outer strongholds of Lingshi: Tianjiazhuang (two li south of the city), Lijia Gou (two li northeast of the city), Suozhou Town (twenty li northeast of the city), and Lengquan (forty li north of the city). At this point, the Yan's puppet troops were extremely panicked, and Yan Xishan and Sun Chu repeatedly telegraphed orders to hold to the death. Just as our main force was besieging Lingshi, Li Zifa's troops stationed in Lingshi fled in panic and were dealt a head-on blow by our blocking troops on the west bank of the river. At the same time, when our troops in Fenxi besieged the city, the Yan's puppet troops defending the city desperately fled to the west, and the two cities were liberated on the same day. In Fujiatan, a certain unit of our army quickly surrounded Fujiatan. The main force of the Yan army stationed in Fujiatan, the Second Regiment of the 39th Division and a battalion of the 218th Regiment of the 73rd Division, fled in disarray like homeless dogs and were also severely struck by our forces on the west bank of the river. When the Yan's puppet troops fled from the above-mentioned areas, they were extremely embarrassed. For example, when our army entered the Fujiatan coal mine, the electric lights were still on. Along the way, they abandoned American-style helmets, rifles, backpacks, uniforms... Their embarrassing situation is truly indescribable. The Tongpu Campaign started on the night of August 14th and lasted until the early morning of September 1st, a total of half a month. We captured five important county towns, one large mechanized coal mine, 52 village and town strongholds, controlled approximately 270 li of railway line, captured alive over 6,400 people including Liu Yonglu, the Chief of Staff of the 39th Division, and two Japanese, killed and wounded over 2,500 people including Zhang Conglong. We seized seven mountain guns, seventeen light and heavy mortars, fifteen heavy machine guns, over 360 light machine guns, over 50 short guns, 78 small cannons, 30 grenade launchers, over 2,600 rifles and carbines, six radio stations, over 50 telephones, over 100 li of insulated wire, four generators, six locomotives, over 100 carriages, two automobiles, over 1,000 landmines, over 1,000 boxes of black explosives, over 10 boxes of yellow explosives, five boxes of fuses, all the coal mining machinery, 119 large and small boxes of gasoline, 40,000 dan of grain, and countless ammunition. This campaign demonstrates that the power of the people is invincible, and any new equipment or new fortifications will vanish like bubbles in the face of the people.

　　同蒲中段半月战绩辉煌
    我军消灭阎伪九千
    解放县城五座及重要矿区富家滩缴获山炮七门轻重机枪近四百挺
    【本报阳城八日电】震撼同蒲全线之同蒲中段爱国自卫战役，两周中风扫席卷洪洞、霍县、赵城、灵石、汾西五城，富（前误傅）家滩著名煤矿一座，大小村镇据点五十二个，俘虏与毙伤约九千人。兹将战役经过报导如下：正当侵入晋南之蒋军集结兵力于上月十二日向东镇、侯马进犯，同蒲中段洪洞、赵城、霍县、灵石、汾西、介休、平遥等地阎伪军，配合蒋军南北呼应，集中兵力四出侵犯。首以霍县六十九师全部三个团，在师长周建社率领之下，于十三日分八路向霍县东之刘家庄等地进犯，且以包围迂回姿态，企图一鼓歼灭该地八路军，然后沿霍县向赵城、洪洞推进。当地军民不得已被迫自卫反击，在廿里的战线上，与六十九师三个团浴血战斗，以爱国热情勇猛冲锋冲出包围，反将该师二○七团全部歼灭，其余两个团歼灭一部。八路军为彻底粉碎蒋阎军南北夹击之阴谋，自刘家庄战斗开始，即向洪洞、赵城、霍县自卫反击，在一百二十里的爱国自卫战线上，八路军与二十万人民并肩作战，首先包围三县外围据点，如洪洞之贾村、李堡、玉峰山，赵城之候村、磨头车站、孙堡，霍县之辛置车站、白龙村、大张、赵家庄。首先是反击洪洞部队，在攻克玉峰山据点后，围攻洪洞城，伪县长张从龙死守不住，先自仓慌出逃，终被击毙于南门外。继洪洞之后，有“陆上要塞”之名的赵城，虽然外围碉堡林立非常坚固，但阻止不住无坚不摧的八路军与人民力量，经两天时间分别将坚固据点之磨头车站、孙堡等克复，立即围攻城关。汾西六十九师残部两个团星夜赶来增援，但被堵击于汾河西。十八日，城内阎军企图突围西逃，又被聚歼于汾河畔。守城卅九师参谋长即在汾河岸上俘虏。六十九师被堵击后，急往后撤，又被我军追击消灭一个营。当大军重重围攻霍县时，阎锡山、孙楚数电霍州专员齐宪孔、守城司令徐子良死守霍县城，待兵增援，并以七十万、五百万元奖金鼓励守城。但八路军健儿仅三十分钟，便将水泥碉堡之霍县城克复，七日内连克三城。部队进城后，纪律严明，秋毫无犯，居民商人夹道欢迎，于二十六日八路军及数十万人民，继向汾西、南关、富家滩、灵石、索州镇、冷泉一线县城及村镇据点自卫反击，阎锡山在富家滩至灵石四十里地建有新式水泥钢骨碉堡，尤其是富家滩、灵石两地，工事坚固非常。首先，我军攻克灵石外围据点田家庄（城南二里）、李家沟（城东北二里）、索州镇（城东北二十里）、冷泉（城北四十里），至此阎伪军惊慌万分，而阎锡山、孙楚再三电令死守。正当我大军包围灵石时，驻灵石李子法部，仓慌逃窜，被我河西堵击部队迎头痛击，同时我在汾西部队围城时，守城阎伪军拼命西逃，两城遂于同日解放。在富家滩，我某部迅速对富家滩包围，驻富家滩之阎军主力部队三十九师第二团，七十三师二一八团一个营，如丧家之犬，仓促逃窜，亦被我在河西痛击。以上各地阎伪军逃窜时，万分狼狈，如富家滩煤矿我军进驻时，电灯尚明，以及沿路抛弃美国大盖帽步枪、背包、制服………，其狼狈情形，正是一言难尽。同蒲战役自八月十四日夜开始，至九月一日清早，前后半月，共克重要县城五座，机器大煤矿一座，村镇据点五十二个，控制铁路线约二百七十余里，生俘三十九师参谋长刘永禄以下六千四百余人，日本人两名，毙伤张从龙以下二千五百余，缴获山炮七门，轻重迫击炮十七门，重机枪十五挺，轻机枪三百六十余挺，短枪五十余支，小炮七十八门，掷弹筒三十个，步马枪二千六百余支，电台六部，电话机五十余部，被复线一百余里，发电机四部，火车头六个，车皮百余个，汽车两辆，地雷千余个，黑色炸药千余箱，黄色炸药十余箱，导火线五箱，煤矿机全部，汽油大小一百一十九箱，粮食四万石，弹药无算。从此战役中，说明人民力量是无敌于天下的，任何有新式的装备，新式的工事，在人民面前会化为泡影。
