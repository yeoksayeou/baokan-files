　　Hindu-Muslim Conflict Benefits the British
    Indian Communists Adopt a Hands-Off Attitude
    Joshi Claims India's Struggle Aims at British Imperialism After Mediation Fails

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Joshi, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, recently issued a statement on the attitude of the CPI regarding the Hindu-Muslim bloodshed conflict, saying: "The CPI intends to remain neutral in this matter." Joshi said: "India's real goal of struggle is to resist British imperialism, and both Muslims and Hindus should participate in this common struggle. However, the current struggle of the Muslim League is not against British imperialism, but has become a struggle against India. Because the Muslim League provokes incidents, the National Congress Party is able to use British bayonets to maintain law and order. This move by the leaders of the Muslim League is really foolish. The Muslim League launched a civil war, giving the National Congress Party an excuse to join the Governor-General's Office and form a provisional government, which is exactly what the British wanted." It is reported that Joshi made this statement after his mediation of the Hindu-Muslim conflict failed.

    约希调解印回失败后称印度斗争目标是英帝国
    【新华社延安二十日电】印度共产党总书记约希，最近就印回流血冲突发表印共的态度说：“印共对此拟置身事外。”约希说：“印度真正的奋斗目标，乃在反抗英帝国主义，回教徒及印度教徒均应参加这共同的斗争，然而目前回教同盟的奋斗，并不是反抗英帝国主义，而已成为反对印度的斗争，因回教同盟挑衅滋事，国民大会党乃得利用英国刺刀以维持法律与治安。回盟领袖此举实愚不可及，回盟发动内战，使国民大会党获一借口得以投入总督府，出而组织临时政府，此正为英国所求之不得者。”按约希系于调停回印冲突失败后作此声明。
