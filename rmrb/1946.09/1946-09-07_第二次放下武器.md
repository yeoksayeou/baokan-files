　　Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 31st: In the battle northeast of Boshan, after a period of shouting, a US-made light machine gun and six US-made rifles were released from the white cement pillbox. Then Hu Shifu led seven Chiang soldiers out, smiling broadly as he greeted the Eighth Route Army soldiers: "Do you recognize me? This is the second time!" It turned out that he had been captured not long ago, and according to their own wishes, he and the other seven Chiang soldiers were released to return to their units. Before leaving, Hu Shifu said humorously: "Goodbye, see you later!" This is proof that Chiang Kai-shek's deception and orders are completely bankrupt in the face of justice. Examples like this are numerous! The warmongers initially scared the soldiers by saying, "The Eighth Route Army will bury you alive when they catch you." But batches of Chiang soldiers who laid down their arms were released and returned to their units, and the wounded were even carried on stretchers. So the head of the civil war issued an order: "All officers and soldiers are only allowed to die in battle, not to be captured. Those who are captured will be beheaded!" But the number of Chiang soldiers surrendering on the front lines did not decrease. Instead, the concerns of those released and returning increased. So the head of the civil war hurriedly changed his order: "Those who are captured and return to their units with their weapons will not be held accountable. Those who return empty-handed will be severely punished!" However, the returned prisoners of war, in addition to having travel expenses issued by the Eighth Route Army in their pockets, were still empty-handed. The order was revised again: "Soldiers who return to their units will be treated leniently, while officers who are captured will be severely punished!" However, war-weariness infected the lower-ranking officers, and platoon, squad, and company commanders successively laid down their weapons on the front lines and were released back to their units. At this point, the order was again ineffective. A Chiang army company commander acutely pointed out the reason, saying, "In order to replenish troops, what can Chiang Kai-shek do?"

　　第二次放下武器
    【新华社临沂三十一日电】在博山东北方面的战斗中，经过一阵喊话，白色士敏土的炮楼里泄出了一挺美式轻机枪和六支美式步枪，接着胡士富带着七名蒋军走出来，笑迷迷地向八路军战士打招呼：“认得我吧？这是第二回了！”原来他是不久之前被俘的，按照他们自己的愿望，他和其他七名蒋军被释放归队了。临别时胡士富幽默地说：“再见，后会有期！”这就是在正义面前蒋介石的欺骗和命令完全破产的一次证明。象这样例子正多着呢！好战分子最初吓唬士兵说：“八路军捉到你们就活埋。”但放下武器的蒋军一批批被释放归队，受伤的还坐着担架。于是内战头子又下一道命令：“所有官兵只准战死，不准被俘，被俘者斩！”但蒋军在火线上缴枪的人并不减少。只是被释归队的顾虑反而增加了。于是内战头子慌忙改发命令道：“被俘者携枪归队，不准追究。徒手归队者重惩！”然而归队的俘虏除荷包里有八路军发的路费外，还是一双空手。命令又修改了：“战士归队者宽大，军官被俘者重惩！”可是厌战情绪感染了下级军官，班排连长纷纷在火线放下武器，且陆续被释放回部，至此命令又告无效。一位蒋军连长一针见血地戮穿原因说：“为了补充兵员，蒋介石有什么办法？”
