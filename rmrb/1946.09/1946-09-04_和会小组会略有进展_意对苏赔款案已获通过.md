Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris – After being away for five weeks, the head of the Soviet delegation to the peace conference, Molotov, left Paris by special plane at 6:00 AM on August 31st to return to Moscow. It is said that Molotov's return is temporary, in order to report on the progress of the peace conference to the Soviet government and to have discussions. It is expected that when the foreign ministers meet on Monday morning (September 2nd), Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky may attend on behalf of Molotov. The work of the peace conference subcommittees made some progress on August 30th. The Italian Economic Committee approved the clause in the draft peace treaty with Italy that stipulates Italy should pay the Soviet Union $100 million in reparations over five years. The proposal by the Canadian representative to postpone the discussion of this clause was rejected by a vote of 15 to 5 (Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa). Before the vote, Vyshinsky said: Countries that were fortunate enough not to be invaded have no right to ask invaded countries to give up their most moderate demands.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Paris - The assistants to the four foreign ministers held a secret meeting last night and began to review the more than 200 amendments submitted to the peace conference, striving to reach agreement on issues that can be passed, thereby accelerating the work of the peace conference.

　　和会小组会略有进展
    意对苏赔款案已获通过
    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：出席和会的苏联首席代表莫洛托夫，在离国五个礼拜之后，已于八月三十一日晨六时乘专机离巴黎返莫斯科。据传莫氏返国系属暂时性质，为的是向苏联政府报告和会进展情形，并有所商讨。预料莫氏于星期一（九月二日）上午外长会开会时，苏联副外长维辛斯基可能代表莫洛托夫出席。八月三十日和会小组委员会的工作有某些进展，意大利经济委员会于晚上批准了对意和约草案中规定意大利于五年内向苏联赔款一万万美元的条款。加拿大代表所提延期讨论这一条款的建议已以十五票对五票（澳洲、巴西、加拿大、新西兰、南非）被否决。在表决之前，维辛斯基说：凡幸而未被侵略的国家，是无权要求受侵略的国家放弃最温和的要求的。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】巴黎讯：四强外长助理于昨晚召开秘密会议，开始检讨交和会之二百余件修正案，力求在可能通过的问题上求得协议，从而加速和会的工作。
