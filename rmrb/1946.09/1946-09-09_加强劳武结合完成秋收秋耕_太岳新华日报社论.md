Strengthening Labor-Military Integration to Complete the Autumn Harvest and Planting
*Taiyue Xinhua Daily* Editorial

　　The White Dew season has arrived, and the autumn harvest is beginning.

　　The fruits of our year's hard work are about to be harvested. However, Chiang Kai-shek's army is expanding its offensive against the Taiyue Liberated Area, having already occupied cities such as Wenxi, Jiangxian, and Yuanqu. They are preparing to loot the people's grain on a large scale and destroy their production. Meanwhile, our vast masses are voluntarily going to the front lines of the self-defense war, resulting in a shortage of rural labor. This poses an even more serious task for this year's autumn harvest and planting. In order to defend the fruits of the people's liberation and labor, to improve people's lives, to enrich the material foundation to support the front lines, and to strive for the complete victory of the patriotic self-defense war, we must accept the experiences of previous years, highly promote the power of organization, implement labor-military integration, and urgently mobilize to combat the looting and destruction by Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops, and safeguard the victorious completion of the autumn harvest and planting. In order to overcome various difficulties and quickly complete the autumn harvest and planting, we offer the following suggestions for reference: First, in the border areas, we must better exert the power of labor-military integration, linking the autumn harvest and planting with the struggle to combat the incursions of stubborn troops and support the front lines. In this regard, various localities have accumulated considerable experience over the years. In particular, the "Du Ba Lian" in northern Henan created an outstanding example this summer. They achieved "quick reaping, quick harvesting, quick drying, and quick storage." They practiced "reaping wherever it ripens first" and "threshing in front and drying and storing in the rear." Their young and middle-aged men were all armed to monitor the enemy in front. They reaped when the enemy did not come, and fought when the enemy came. Their men, women, old, and young were all mobilized. After completing their own work, the old women and children also took time to help with reaping and transporting. People were so busy that they only nodded and smiled when they met. People were so calm that they hardly paid attention to the enemy's bullets flying around. As a result, they managed to clear the fields in three days, continuing the policy of emptying the villages, and the enemy never looted a single grain. The creation of this model by "Du Ba Lian" is worthy of our good example and our great effort to promote it. Our local armed forces and guerrillas should take the initiative to attack the enemy, lead the masses to launch an explosion and sabotage campaign, and protect the autumn harvest and planting of the masses with arms. Second, the war is currently tight, and the entire region is participating in the war and joining the army on a large scale, making labor feel scarce. To solve this difficulty, we must make all kinds of labor mutual aid organizations in various places more widespread, more consolidated, and more advanced, and organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers (women and children). In particular, we must pay attention to organizing semi-able-bodied laborers, even if it is temporary or small-scale, it is good. After the women of Lujiahe Village in Yancheng implemented methods such as family dividend sharing and courtyard work exchange, almost all of the village's mutual aid weeding this summer was completed by women. In the current situation of labor shortage, it is worthy of our good learning. Mutual aid organizations that have stagnated in the past must be immediately strengthened and reorganized, and temporary mutual aid groups should be widely organized. Third, we must take care of the autumn harvest and planting of the participating militia, the participating masses, and the families of revolutionary martyrs, cadres, and soldiers without labor, ensuring that they harvest cleanly and plant wheat well, so that hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians can fight the enemy with peace of mind. Recently, the masses of villages such as Jishi and Beikongtan have been weeding and plowing for the families of militiamen who have gone on expeditions. Mutual aid groups in villages such as Shimin Jiaochang have been sending manure and plowing land for the families of revolutionary martyrs, militiamen on expeditions, and the families of the participating masses. The Beichen Mutual Aid Group in Fushan wrote to the people who went to the front to participate in the war: "You should do your work well in the front, and you don't have to worry about the crops at home..." Many places have implemented work exchange for rotation of war, participation in war, and production, solving the difficulties of the families of those who serve on the front lines. All of these should be greatly promoted to make them more practical and effective. In the occupied areas such as Wenxi, Xiaxian, Quwo, Jiangxian, and Xinjiang, we should, according to the specific conditions of the local area, carry forward the rich experience of fighting the enemy in the grid network over the past few years, and discuss it well with the masses, and use all appropriate methods to oppose and reduce the enemy's harsh taxes, looting, and destruction, so as to protect the autumn harvest and autumn planting. In addition, all agencies, organizations, schools, and troops in rest should do everything possible to help the local people with the autumn harvest and autumn planting. We have rich experience over the years, we have a high degree of enthusiasm for production after liberation, and we are encouraged by the victory of the patriotic self-defense war on the front lines. As long as we mobilize and organize immediately, we will be able to overcome various difficulties, smash the attempts of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops to seize grain and destroy the people's production, and successfully complete the task of the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

　　加强劳武结合完成秋收秋耕
    太岳新华日报社论
    白露已届，秋收开始。
    我们一年辛勤劳作的果实，就要开始收获了，可是蒋军正扩大向太岳解放区的进攻，已侵占我闻喜、绛县、垣曲等城，并准备大规模抢劫人民的粮食及破坏人民的生产，而我广大群众又自动走上自卫战争的前线，农村劳力缺乏这就给今年的秋收秋耕提出了更加严重的任务。为了保卫人民翻身及劳动的果实，为了提高人民生活，充实物质基础支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争的完全胜利，我们必须接受历年的经验，高度发扬组织的力量，实行劳武结合，紧急动员起来，打击蒋阎军的抢掠破坏，保卫秋收秋耕的胜利完成。为了排除种种困难，迅速完成秋收秋耕，我们提出下列意见供作参考：第一、在边沿地区必须更好的发挥劳武结合的威力，将秋收秋耕与打击顽军进犯与支援前线的斗争联系起来，这一方面几年来各地均有不少经验，而在豫北“杜八联”今年夏季更创造了出色的范例，他们实现了“快割、快收、快晒、快藏”，他们是“那儿先熟，那儿先收”，“前面打场，后面晒藏”，他们的青壮年全部武装起来在前边监视敌人，敌不来就收割，敌人来就打仗，他们的男女老幼全部动员，老婆婆小孩们在完成自己的工作之后，还抽空帮助收割和运送，人们紧张得见面只有一笑点头，人们沉着到敌人的子弹飞舞也不大理睬，因之争取到三天地里光，继续空室清野，敌人始终没有抢走一颗粮，“杜八联”这个模范的创造，值得我们很好的效法，值得我们大大发挥。我们的地方武装与游击队，更应主动的袭击敌人，领导群众展开爆炸破击运动，武装保卫群众的秋收秋耕。第二、目前战争吃紧，全区都在大规模的参战参军，劳动力自感缺乏。为了解决这一困难，对各地各式各样的劳力互助组织，就必须把它更普遍，更巩固，更提高起来，一切全劳动力与半劳动力（妇女儿童）都组织起来。特别是要注意组织半劳动力，那怕是暂时的，小规模的，也是好的，阳城岩山芦家河妇女，实行了家庭分红同院变工等办法之后，今年夏季的全村互助锄苗，几乎全是妇女们完成的，在目前劳力缺乏的情况下，是值得我们很好学习的。过去互助已陷停顿的，更须立刻加强整理，广泛组织临时性的互助组。第三、必须照顾参战民兵，及参战群众们，及无劳力的抗属、干属、烈属的秋收秋耕，保证他们秋收干净，麦子种好，使数十万军民无牵无挂的安心对敌。最近冀氏、北孔滩等村群众，为出征民兵家属锄苗犁地，士敏教场等村互助组为抗属，出征民兵及参战群众的家属送粪犁地，浮山北陈互助组给去前方参战的人写信：“你们在前方好好支差吧，家里的庄稼不用你们操心……”许多地方都实行了轮战、参战与生产的变工，解决了服务前线者家庭的困难，凡此等等都应该大大推广，使之更加切实而有效。在沦陷区如闻、夏、曲、绛、新绛等地，应依当地具体情况，发扬几年来在格子网内对敌斗争的丰富经验，与群众很好的商讨，用一切适当的办法反对和减少敌人的苛杂掠夺与破坏，以保卫秋收与秋耕。此外各机关团体学校及休整中的部队，都应尽一切可能帮助驻地群众秋收秋耕。我们有历年来丰富的经验，我们有翻身后高度的生产热情，有前线爱国自卫战争胜利的鼓舞，只要我们立即动员起来，组织起来，一定能够克服种种困难，粉碎蒋阎军抢夺粮食与破坏人民生产的企图，胜利的完成秋收秋耕的任务。
