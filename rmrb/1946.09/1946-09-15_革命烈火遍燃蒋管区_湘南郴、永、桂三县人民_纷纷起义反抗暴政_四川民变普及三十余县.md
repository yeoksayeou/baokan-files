　　Revolutionary Flames Spread Throughout the KMT-Controlled Areas
    People in Chen, Yong, and Gui Counties in Southern Hunan
    Rise Up in Revolt Against Tyranny
    Popular Uprisings in Sichuan Spread to Over Thirty Counties
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] According to the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on August 25th: The people of Chen County, Yongxing, and Guiyang counties in southern Hunan, forced by the tyranny of the Kuomintang government, have risen up in revolt and organized a "Poor People's Corps" of tens of thousands of people. Many members of the corps are anti-Japanese guerrillas from the period of Japanese occupation, each with weapons seized from the enemy. After the Japanese surrender, large landlords returned home and forcibly bought farmers' land at low prices, starting with two shi of grain for one shi of paddy field (one-fifth of a mu), then one shi of grain for one shi of paddy field, or lending grain to farmers at usurious interest rates of more than three times the original amount, causing farmers to lose their land. Kuomintang county officials and Bao-Jia personnel distributed the local stored grain. Not only could the people not get relief from the stored grain, but they also had to contribute grain to restore the stored grain. Therefore, the people launched the "Grain Depot Breaking Movement," with several or a dozen poor people gathering together to demand that landlords provide grain for relief. Subsequently, due to the "encirclement and suppression" by the Kuomintang army, the small units combined to form the "Poor People's Corps," issuing a declaration with the slogan "We only want rice, not money," and exposing the corruption of Kuomintang officials and the exploitation of landlords, calling on those who had no food to eat to join their ranks. Although the Kuomintang army had repeatedly "suppressed" them, they did not dare to enter the revolutionary peasants' base area of ​​Longwangling.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] According to Kuomintang newspapers Chengdu Kuai Bao and Huangpu Daily, popular uprisings in Sichuan have spread to more than thirty counties, with activities in Wangcang, Guangyuan, Zhaohua, Bazhong, Nanjiang, and Mianzhu in northern Sichuan; Fengjie, Wuxi, Yunyang, @ County, and Dazhou in eastern Sichuan; Dazu, Leshan, and Emei in southern Sichuan; Dayi, Guanxian, Wenjiang, Xinfan, Xindu, Pengshan, Zou County, Jintang, Wenchuan, Chongning, Zhongjiang in western Sichuan; and Anyue, Lezhi, and Tongnan in central Sichuan. Even the areas near Chongqing, the provisional capital, and Chengdu, where the Sichuan provincial government is located, are also areas of activity. In addition to the extremely powerful uprisings in Wangcang and Guangyuan, there are more than 1,500 rebels in Chongqing and Wenchuan in western Sichuan, equipped with dozens of machine guns and several steel cannons. The Sichuan Provincial Government has recently established a joint county command post to direct operations. One detachment of the 7th Security Regiment stationed in Huaiyuan "advanced to suppress" in the direction of Longfengchang, and after a fierce battle of nine hours, the detachment was captured with more than a dozen casualties, losing two machine guns and one steel cannon. In the area bordering Chongqing, Dayi, and Guanxian, there are hundreds of rebels. The 7th Security Regiment attacked several times, resulting in nearly a hundred casualties among officers and soldiers.

　　革命烈火遍燃蒋管区
    湘南郴、永、桂三县人民
    纷纷起义反抗暴政
    四川民变普及三十余县
    【新华社延安十二日电】据八月廿五日沪文汇报消息：湘南的郴县、永兴及桂阳三县人民，被国民党政府的暴政所迫纷纷起义，现已组织数万人的“贫民团”。该团成员多系日寇占领期中的抗日游击队员，每人都有从敌人手中夺来的武器。日寇投降以后，大地主回家以低价强迫收买农民田地，开始以两石谷子换一石水田（五分之一亩），继而一石谷换一石田或以三倍以上的高利贷食与农民，致使农民都失了田地。国民党县府官吏及保甲人员分下了地方的积谷，人民不惟不能从积谷得到救济，反而要出谷恢复积谷，因此人民便展开“破仓运动”，几个或十几个穷人集合在一起，要地主出粮救济。继因国民党军队的“围剿”，乃由各小单位合组成“贫民团”，发表宣言，提出“只要米不要钱”的口号，并揭露国民党官吏的贪污，地主的盘剥，号召没有饭吃的人，去参加他们的队伍。国民党军队虽曾多次“征剿”，但都不敢进入起义农民的根据地龙王岭。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据国民党报纸成都快报及黄埔日报透露，四川民变遍及三十余县，活动地区有川北之旺苍、广元、昭化、巴中、南江、绵竹，川东之奉节、巫溪、云阳、＠县、达县，川南之大足、乐山、峨嵋，川西之大邑、灌县、温江、新繁、新都、彭山、邹县、金堂、汶川、崇宁、中江及中部之安岳、乐至、潼南，甚至陪都重庆附近、四川省府所在地的成都二近亦为活动地区。除旺苍、广元等地变民声势极为浩大外，川西崇庆、汶川有变民一千五百余人，装有机枪数十挺钢炮数门。川省府近设联县指挥部指挥作战，驻怀远之保七团一个队向龙凤场方面“进剿”，激战九小时，结果该队被俘十余人，伤亡二十余人，失去机枪两挺钢炮一门。在崇庆、大邑、灌县交界处有变民数百，保七团进击数次，结果官兵死伤近百。
