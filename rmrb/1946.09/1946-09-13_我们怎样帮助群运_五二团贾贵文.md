How We Help Mass Movements
    Jia Guiwen, Fifth and Second Regiment

　　Our teams helping the mass movement for emancipation are formed and assigned based on the principle of people from that village returning to that village. The advantage of this approach is close contact with the masses, easy understanding of the situation, and the ability to fully and accurately utilize the boldness and lack of concern characteristic of our troops. Moreover, it aligns with their own interests, as emancipation team members become part of the masses and can lead them as role models.

　　After the emancipation teams were formed, everyone felt a lack of experience and little confidence. Therefore, we found a comrade who had been a village chief for several years and led mass movements to give everyone a detailed introduction. At the same time, several issues to be aware of were raised: First, work should be carried out under the leadership of local comrades. Second, stand firm, fear no threats, and resist temptations. Third, don't just look after yourselves; when everyone is emancipated, you will be too. Fourth, give the masses more support and courage.

　　The West Bangzuo team consisted of three people: team leader Li Binglai (a veteran soldier) from a very poor background, and the other two were a hired worker and a poor peasant. When they returned to their village, the district and village cadres were not yet bold enough to stand up for the people, and the masses were influenced by thoughts of a change of regime, wanting to fight but not daring to. After they arrived in the village, the situation immediately changed. Groups of three or five people found them at their homes, chatting with them late into the night, and becoming more and more enthusiastic. They said to the masses, "Now it is our world, it's the same everywhere, let's do it, what's there to be afraid of?" Li Binglai's aunt asked him, "Binglai, you are in the army, you know the situation inside, do you think the Eighth Route Army can hold its ground?" So Li Binglai told them about his own experiences and said with certainty, "The Eighth Route Army is getting more and more stable and will never leave!" His aunt said, "Alas, my land and property… I've wanted to fight for it for a long time, but no one would stand up for me. People said the Central Army would come and it would be terrible, which made me undecided." Binglai said, "Make up your mind, what's there to be afraid of! I'm back to settle accounts too! Now Chairman Mao is calling on us to emancipate ourselves, if we don't do it now, when will we?"

　　In this way, they naturally chatted with the masses, talked about their hardships, compared themselves to others. Within five days, they mobilized Li Yu's family – whose brother was killed by the local tyrant Li Liyin – who had originally dared not fight, and turned them into activists, launching the struggle against the local tyrant Li Liyin, and achieving complete success.

　　In order not to be sabotaged by reactionary forces, they appeared as if they were home on leave, and no one except the district cadres knew that they were part of the emancipation team. They became a good bridge connecting the district cadres and the masses, often telling the district cadres the real situation and studying with them how to proceed, quickly breaking the stagnant situation. Originally, they were scheduled to work for half a month, but when they returned to the team after a month, the district cadres and the masses would not let them leave, all saying in unison, "Stay a few more days!"

　　After returning home, they were very happy because they had all received the benefits of emancipation, having houses and land. At the same time, the village's care for their families, such as plowing fields, fetching water, and burning firewood, was much better than before. In summarizing this work, they all said, "Now we truly realize that the revolution is good for us, and we must be more determined in the future!"

　　我们怎样帮助群运
    五二团贾贵文
    我们帮助群运的翻身组是依据那村人回那村去的原则组成和分配的；这样作的好处是与群众连系密切，容易了解情况，使部队同志胆子大顾虑少的特点，能充分而准确的发挥；且与本身利益一致，翻身队员成为群众的一员，能在群众中领导群众起带头作用。
    翻身组组成后，大家感到缺乏经验，信心不大，于是找了一个当了几年村长领导过群运的同志给大家作了详细介绍，同时提出了几个应注意的问题：一、要在地方同志领导下进行工作。二、站稳立场，不怕威胁不受利诱。三、不要光顾自己，大家翻了身，自己也就翻了身。四、多给群众撑腰壮胆。
    西傍佐组三个人，组长李炳来（老战士）赤贫，其余两人一是雇工、一是贫农成分。他们回到村上时，正是区村干部未能大胆撑腰作主，群众受变天思想影响，想斗又不敢斗的时候，他们到村后，村上情况立即起了变化。群众三五成群的找到他们家里，深更半夜还和他们扯，而且越扯越上劲。他们对群众说：“现在是咱的世界，到处都一样，干吧，怕啥？”李炳来的本家婶子问他：“炳来，你在队伍上，里边情形你清楚，你说八路军站住站不住？”于是李炳来把自己亲身经历的事实讲给他们以后，肯定的说：“八路军越站越稳，永不会走！”他婶子说：“唉，我的庄子地……………早就想斗了，就是没人给咱作主，人家说中央军过来就不得了，弄的我没了主意。”炳来说：“拿定主意吧，怕啥！我也是回来算账的！现在毛主席叫咱翻身还不翻，还等到啥时候？”
    就这样和群众自然地在一起拉家常，道苦处，说说自己比比别人，五天内他们把本来不敢斗争的李鱼的——被恶霸李戾银杀死了哥哥的——动员起来，成了积极分子，掀起了反恶霸李戾银的斗争，而且得到了圆满的结果。
    为了不被反动势力破坏，他们是用请假回家的面貌出现的，除了区干部而外谁也不知道他们是翻身组。他们成为区干部与群众联系的一个很好的桥梁，经常把真实情况告诉区干部，并和他们一齐研究进行，使沉闷的局面很快就打开了。本来他们预定半月的工作，结果到了一月后归队时区干部和群众还不让走，都异口同声说：“再住几天吧！”
    回家后，他们非常高兴，因为他们都得到了翻身利益有了房子和地了，同时村上对他们家里的照顾如代耕吃水烧柴等都比过去好得多了，在总结这一工作时他们都说：“现在才真正体会到革命对自己就是有好处，以后一定要更加坚决地干！”
