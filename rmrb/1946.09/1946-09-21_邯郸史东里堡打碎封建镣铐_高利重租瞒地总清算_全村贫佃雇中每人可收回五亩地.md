　　Handan Shidonglibao Smashes Feudal Shackles
    Thoroughly Liquidates High Interest Rates, Heavy Rent, and Concealed Land
    Every Poor Tenant Farmer and Hired Laborer in the Village Can Recover Five Mu of Land
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 17th Dispatch] The masses of Shidonglibao Village in this county launched a comprehensive struggle against traitors and feudal exploitation, which lasted for twenty days and concluded victoriously at the beginning of this month. Under the leadership of the Farmers' Association, the masses in the village, after listening to grievances in various mass organizations and among the families of victims, conducted a comprehensive liquidation struggle against twenty-three families of traitors, landlords, and local bullies, raising more than 450 issues. Among them, the cases of traitorous landlords Shi Zhanyuan, Wen Wanlu, and local bully Zhang Lide each accounted for more than fifty issues. The peasants calculated the three main types of illegal exploitation they suffered: (1) Concealing land: The landlords concealed all their land in the counties of Cheng'an and Ci, and shifted the burden to the poor peasants in the village. The traitorous landlord Wen Wanlu alone concealed more than 100 mu of land. The 800 mu of concealed land for the landlords and local bullies was burdened with more than 2,600 shi of millet. (2) Exploitation through high rents and embezzlement by traitorous landlords amounted to a total of 171,800 jin of cotton and more than 1,400 shi of grain. (3) Exploitation through usurious loans and embezzlement by the pseudo-village head amounted to a total of more than 1,100 million yuan in foreign currency. On September 3rd, the village held a liquidation and struggle meeting. The masses were exceptionally enthusiastic, explaining the reasons for their grievances and presenting detailed accounts of the above three types of exploitation. The targets of the struggle, upon learning that the opinions raised by the masses were completely true, lowered their heads and admitted their mistakes, and "asked for forgiveness from the fellow villagers." Based on the severity of their crimes and the extent of their exploitation, the masses left them with more than seven qing of land, enough for production and livelihood. The families of Shi Zhanyuan, Wen Wanlu, and others were also left with more than three mu of land per person. Afterwards, some landlords reflected: "The fellow villagers truly implemented the lenient policy! We committed such great crimes, yet they still left us with a good way out; as long as we work ourselves, we can still live a good life." Now, 104 poor, tenant, hired, and middle peasant families in the village are processing the fruits of the struggle. It is estimated that each person can recover five mu of land, achieving "land to the tiller." (Leng Bing)
