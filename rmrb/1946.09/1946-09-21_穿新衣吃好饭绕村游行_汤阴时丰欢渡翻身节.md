　　Wearing New Clothes, Eating Good Food, Parading Around the Village
    Tangyin Shifeng Joyfully Celebrates Liberation Day
    [Report from Changzhi by Our Newspaper on the 16th] The masses in Shifeng Village, Tangyin, who have been liberated, held a grand celebration meeting on August 26th to celebrate their victory. Everyone wore new clothes, every family ate good food, and the streets and courtyards were cleaned spotlessly. Many families pasted red and green couplets on their gates, which read: "The Communist Party has come, and the people have been liberated"; "We have settled our accounts of blood and sweat, and from now on we will live a good life." A decorated archway was built on the street, and a portrait of Chairman Mao was hung in the center of the rostrum. During the meeting, many peasants voluntarily took the stage to speak. Wang Youzhi, a sixty-year-old hired laborer, said: "I have been a farmhand all my life and have never had a good day. That year, I borrowed a dou of rice from the landlord Wang Pihou, and I could never pay it back, forcing me to flee the famine and stay away from home, afraid to return. This year, I have been allocated four mu of land. This world is really good!" A woman named Li Baoheng clapped her hands in the crowd and shouted loudly: "I am so happy today! I am so happy that I can't express it!" Some talked about the Kuomintang's offensive against the liberated areas, and everyone said: "If the Kuomintang reactionaries dare to come, we will fight them to the end!" When the chairman of the farmers' association announced the items seized from the landlords and local tyrants, the masses shouted: "This is our blood and sweat, and we want it back!" After the meeting, a large parade was held, with drums and sheng and xiao instruments, parading around the whole village. Finally, everyone unanimously decided that this day would be "Liberation Day."

　　穿新衣吃好饭绕村游行
    汤阴时丰欢渡翻身节
    【本报长治十六日电】汤阴时丰村翻了身的群众于八月廿六日举行庆祝翻身胜利大会，人人穿新衣，家家吃好饭，街院打扫得干干净净。许多人家大门上贴着红绿对联，上面写着：“来了共产党，人民翻了身”；“算回我们血汗帐，从此来过好时光；”街上搭有彩楼，主席台中央挂着毛主席像。开会时，许多农民自动登台讲话。六十岁的老雇工王有只说：“俺当了一辈子长工，没好活过一天；那年借了地主王丕候一斗米，就一直还不完，逼的我逃荒在外，不敢回家。今年我算回来四亩地，这世界真是好呀！”妇女李保衡在人群中拍着手高声喊叫：“我今天过的真高兴呀！我高兴得说不出来！”有的谈到国民党正向解放区进攻，大家说：“国民党反动派要敢来，我们就要和他干到底！”在农会主席宣布全村从地主恶霸手里清算出的东西时，群众高呼：“这是咱们的血汗，我们要回来啦！”会后进行大游行，打着锣鼓，吹着笙箱，绕遍了全村。最后大家一致决定是日为“翻身节”。
