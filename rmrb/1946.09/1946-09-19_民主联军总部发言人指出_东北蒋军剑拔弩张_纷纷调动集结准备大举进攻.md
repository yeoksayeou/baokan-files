Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th: The spokesperson for the Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters recently gave a statement to our agency reporter stating: After the announcement of the temporary ceasefire in Northeast China on June 7th, Chiang's troops immediately tore up the agreement and never ceased their attacks on our forces, successively occupying more than 30 towns and villages including Faku (June 8th), Huadian (June 10th), and Kangping (August 25th). Accompanying the spread of the flames of civil war within the passes, the Kuomintang army in Northeast China is once again tense. Since the beginning of this month, the New 6th Army has been transferred south to the Liaoyang, Anshan, and Haicheng areas, and has been harassing Liaodong for days; the 71st Army is currently gathering in the Liaoyuan, Faku, and Kangping areas, preparing to invade the West Manchurian Liberated Area; the New 1st Army is concentrated in the Changchun, Yongji, and south bank of the Songhua River areas, carrying out repairs to the Songhua River railway bridge and various fortifications, preparing to move north. On September 8th, Kuomintang newspapers in Shenyang and Changchun openly announced an attack on Harbin, and in Harbin, the rear of the Democratic Allied Forces, the Jiang Pengfei conspiracy to riot instigated by Chiang Kai-shek was recently uncovered. Judging from the above facts, it can be seen that Chiang's troops have never stopped attacking our forces for a single day, and it further shows that the Kuomintang authorities are determined to continue to expand the civil war in Northeast China. As for the mediation work of the Changchun branch of the Executive Headquarters, up to now, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the Kuomintang side, there is not a single fact that can make us believe that the Executive Headquarters will have any effect on mediating the war. We do not believe that the Changchun branch of the Executive Headquarters will have any effect on the ceasefire under the US government's policy of aiding Chiang and fighting the civil war. Facts have proven that the several groups dispatched by the Changchun branch, such as the Shuangcheng 35th Group, the Shenyang 27th Group, the Haicheng 30th Group, the Hailong 29th Group, the Siping 28th Group, and the Dehui 34th Group, have never fairly mediated the attacks of the Kuomintang army in various places. Although the American mediators are enthusiastic about the mediation work, before the US government's policy of aiding Chiang and Chiang Kai-shek's policy of civil war are not changed, the so-called mediation can only be a caricature of the civil war. Obviously, only the people of Northeast China themselves can stop Chiang Kai-shek from expanding the civil war and protect peace in Northeast China.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Military News: (1) At the beginning of the month, Chiang's New 6th Army's 22nd Division advanced towards Ximu City (southeast of Haicheng) and was repulsed by the Democratic Allied Forces, who killed and wounded more than 200. (2) On the 3rd and 5th of this month, more than 300 of Chiang's 71st Army's 88th Division in Wulajie (north of Yongji) twice invaded Gangyao, but were repelled. (3) On the 5th of this month, a unit of the Democratic Allied Forces recovered Xiangyang Fort in Huinan (east of Hailong), killing and wounding more than ten Chiang soldiers.

　　民主联军总部发言人指出
    东北蒋军剑拔弩张
    纷纷调动集结准备大举进攻
    【新华社哈尔滨十六日电】民主联军总部发言人顷对本社记者发表谈话称：六月七日东北暂时停战宣布后，蒋军立即撕毁协定，从未停止向我军进攻，先后侵占我法库（六月八日）、桦甸（六月十日）、康平（八月廿五日）等城镇三十余处。伴随关内内战烽火的蔓延，东北国民党军复剑拔弩张。本月以来，新六军已南调辽阳、鞍山、海城一带，连日向辽东出扰；七十一军现正集结于辽源、法库、康平一带，准备向西满解放区进犯；新一军集中在长春、永吉及松花江南岸一带，进行修复松花江铁桥及各种工事，准备向北蠢动。九月八日沈阳、长春的国民党报纸又公开宣布进攻哈尔滨，而在民主联军后防哈市，最近复破获蒋介石指使下的姜鹏飞阴谋暴动案。综观上述事实，可知蒋军从未一日停止过向我军进攻，更表明国民党当局决心继续扩大东北内战。至于说到执行部长春分部的调处工作，到现在为止，由于国民党方面的阻扰破坏，还没有任何一点事实能够使我们相信执行部对调处战事会发生任何作用。我们不相信在美国政府的援蒋打内战政策的情况下，执行部长春分部会对停战事发生任何作用。事实证明，长春分部所派出的几个小组如双城三十五小组、沈阳二十七小组、海城三十小组、海龙二十九小组、四平二十八小组、德惠三十四小组，从来没有对各地国民党军的进攻作过任何公平的调处，虽然美国调处人员热心调处工作，但在美国政府援蒋政策及蒋介石内战政策没有改变之前，所谓调处只能是内战的讽刺画。显然能够阻止蒋介石扩大内战保护东北和平的，只有东北人民自己。
    【新华社延安十六日电】军息：（一）海城蒋新六军二十二师月初向析木城（海城东南）进犯，为民主联军毙伤二百余。（二）本月三、五两日乌拉街（永吉北）蒋七十一军八八师三百余，两次进犯缸窑，均被击退。（三）本月五日民主联军一部恢复辉南（海龙东）之向阳堡，毙伤蒋军十余名。
