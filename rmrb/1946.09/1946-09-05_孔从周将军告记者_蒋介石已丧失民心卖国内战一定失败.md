　　General Kong Congzhou Tells Reporters
    Chiang Kai-shek Has Lost Popular Support; The Treacherous Civil War Is Bound to Fail
    [This Newspaper, Handan, 30th dispatch] On the afternoon of the 28th, this reporter met with General Kong Congzhou, commander of the 55th Division of the 38th Army of the Kuomintang, who revolted in Gongxian County, Henan Province, at the reception building of the military region. General Kong expressed his extreme indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's launch of a nationwide civil war and the crimes of American imperialism in arming and helping the Chinese reactionaries to slaughter the Chinese people. He said: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country shed countless blood to achieve victory in the War of Resistance. Now, Chiang Kai-shek, the dictator, is trying to swallow the fruits of victory alone, launching a nationwide civil war, and introducing American imperialism into China, causing the victory of all the Chinese people to be on the verge of disappearing. Which son of China is not heartbroken by this?" Then, based on everything he had personally seen, General Kong pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war was digging his own grave, and its result would inevitably be failure. He said: Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war has first of all lost popular support. In most areas of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, due to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war, famine is widespread, and large numbers of people are frequently starving to death because their grain has been completely confiscated. The director of the Jiangxi Grain Tax Collection Office of the Kuomintang also committed suicide by jumping into the river because there was no military grain for the civil war. If this continues, the officials will force the people to rebel, and the army will have no food to fight with. How can Chiang Kai-shek continue to fight? Secondly, Chiang Kai-shek has also lost the hearts of the soldiers. After the victory of the War of Resistance, regardless of direct descendants or miscellaneous troops, the soldiers eagerly hoped to disarm and return home to reunite with their families. Who would be willing to kill each other and become cannon fodder in the civil war? In addition, Chiang Kai-shek has always adopted a policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops. There are frequent contradictions and mutual infighting within his camp, so the hearts of the soldiers have long been lost! Third, he has lost the hearts of the officials. Chiang Kai-shek's policy of excluding dissidents has made it impossible for a large number of officers who have contributed to the War of Resistance to be appointed, while the party-affiliated officers of the Central Military Academy have been recruited in large numbers. As a result, most officers feel hopeless about their future. General Kong said: Based on the above reasons, the Chiang army, forced to go to the battlefield of the civil war, will inevitably become passive in their work, desert, or revolt on the front lines. When talking about the self-defense operations of the military and civilians in the liberated areas against the civil war, General Kong said: The military and civilians in the liberated areas are purely based on the righteousness of defending the fruits of the War of Resistance and their own liberation interests, which is upright and aboveboard. Therefore, the heroic self-defense war of the military and civilians in the liberated areas will inevitably crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. General Kong continued: The reason why the reactionaries can be proud of carrying out the civil war is because of the aid of American imperialism to the Chinese reactionaries. However, although Chiang Kai-shek has excellent weapons, if they are used by war-weary soldiers, his excellent weapons cannot be controlled. The military and civilians in the liberated areas, however, have the support of the people of the whole country who oppose the war, which is an infinite force. As the ancient saying goes, "Those who win the hearts of the people prosper, and those who lose the hearts of the people perish." This is General Kong's concluding remark on Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, General Kong highly praised the great victories of self-defense on the Longhai, Suwan and Tongpu lines in the liberated areas. He said: This is necessary to strive for national peace. Only by giving Chiang Kai-shek a head-on blow can the dictator be forced to lay down his butcher knife, and national peace will be realized as soon as possible.

　　孔从周将军告记者
    蒋介石已丧失民心卖国内战一定失败
    【本报邯郸三十日电】二十八日下午，记者于军区交际处大楼会见河南巩县起义的国民党三十八军五十五师师长孔从周将军。孔将军对目前蒋介石发动全国内战，美帝国主义武装帮助中国反动派屠杀中国人民的罪行，表示非常愤慨。他说：“抗战八年，全国军民，不知流了多少鲜血，才取得抗日战争的胜利。现在蒋介石独裁者，企图独吞胜利果实，发动了全国规模的内战，并把一个美国帝国主义引进了中国，使全中国人民的胜利，又将趋于消失。凡属中华男儿，对此谁不痛心？”接着孔将军以自己亲身所见的一切，指出蒋介石的卖国内战，正是自掘坟墓，其结果必遭失败。他说：蒋介石的卖国内战，首先已失去民心。国民党统治区的大部地区，由于蒋介石的独裁内战，已普遍闹着灾荒，大批人民，已因粮食缴尽而频频饿死。国民党江西粮赋征收处处长，亦因内战军粮无着而投江自杀。如此下去，官逼民反，军无战粮，蒋介石还能打得下去？其次，蒋介石同样失去了兵心，抗战胜利之后，不管嫡系和杂牌，士兵切盼解甲归里共聚天伦之乐，谁还愿意自相残杀，徒作内战炮灰？加之蒋介石一贯采取消灭杂牌政策，其阵营内部，经常矛盾，互相倾轧，故兵心早已去矣！第三、已失官心。蒋介石排斥异己的政策，已使大批抗战有功的军官，不得任用，而党化的中央军校军官，却被大批录用。因之，大部军官深感前途无望。孔将军说：基于以上数因，被迫开赴内战战场的蒋军，必致怠工逃亡或火线起义。当谈到解放区军民反对内战的自卫作战时，孔将军说：解放区军民纯系出于保卫抗战果实和自己翻身利益大义所在，正大光明。因此，解放区军民的英勇自卫战，必然会粉碎蒋介石的进攻。孔将军继称：反动派进行内战所以能自豪者，是因为美帝国主义对中国反动派的援助。但蒋介石虽有优良武器，若以厌战士兵去使用，其优良武器亦无法操纵，而解放区的军民，却有全国反战人民的援助，这是无穷的力量。古语云：“得民者昌，失民者亡。”这就是孔将军对蒋介石的结语。最后，孔将军甚赞解放区陇海苏皖同蒲各线自卫的大捷。他说：这是争取全国和平所必须的。只有给蒋介石迎头痛击后，独裁者才会被迫放下屠刀，全国和平才会早日实现。
