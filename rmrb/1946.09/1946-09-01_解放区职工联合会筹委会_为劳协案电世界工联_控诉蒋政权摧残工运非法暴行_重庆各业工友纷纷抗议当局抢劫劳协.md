Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: The Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union Federation of the Liberated Areas sent an appeal to trade unions of various countries on the 15th regarding the armed "takeover" of the Chongqing Labor Association and its welfare institutions. The original telegram to Mr. Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, is as follows: To Mr. Saillant of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Paris, and forwarded to the trade unions of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union:

    The Chinese fascists, in order to carry out a large-scale civil war and persist in dictatorial politics, are implementing further cruel oppression of the movement for peace, democracy, and unity in China after victory. They have forcibly taken over the offices of the Chongqing Labor Association and its affiliated welfare institutions, many personnel have been arrested and subjected to severe torture, they want to maintain their rule over the workers in this way. This behavior has already been inflicted in various places, such as the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, and the detention of the Guangdong representative of the Labor Association. Future oppression will inevitably deepen with the expansion of the civil war. The peaceful and democratic movement of the Chinese Labor Association has suffered a serious threat, and the resolution of the World Federation of Trade Unions for permanent human peace has been obstructed. Our 1.5 million workers in the Liberated Areas, for the sake of China's peace and democracy, and the world's human peace, resolutely oppose this illegal behavior. We will fight against any attempt to undermine the peaceful and democratic program of the Labor Association and the resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and hope you will give us your support.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Chongqing News: Workers from all industries here have been continuously writing to the Xinhua Daily in recent days, protesting the Kuomintang authorities' violent seizure of the Labor Association. A group of female workers said: "The Labor Association is the home of us workers, and it is not the 'Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' run by the government or any party. We simply do not recognize that this organization has any qualifications to 'take over'. It is truly a ferocious fascist behavior!" A group of driver workers said: "Today we have mobilized a large number of members of the same trade to fight with the 'Federation of Trade Unions' to win back the Labor Association and the arrested personnel that seek welfare for us. We will definitely fight to the end." Representatives of workers in Jiangbei said indignantly: "The Labor Association is a legitimate workers' organization, not the enemy. How can it be robbed by force in broad daylight? Workers from all walks of life unite and take righteous action!" A group of automobile workers appealed: "All members of the Labor Association and workers from all industries across the country, unite regardless of region, use our strength to demand that people from all walks of life uphold justice, request the government to handle the matter according to law, and accuse the workers of the world." A group of workers from a certain machine factory said: "The workers in this factory are extremely indignant about this unreasonable matter. The Labor Association seeks welfare for the workers, and undoubtedly we workers need her and love her. Whoever wants to seize her, not only will the colleagues in this factory not agree, but all the workers in Chongqing and the whole country will definitely stand up to oppose it!"

　　解放区职工联合会筹委会
    为劳协案电世界工联
    控诉蒋政权摧残工运非法暴行
    重庆各业工友纷纷抗议当局抢劫劳协
    【新华社南京二十八日电】中国解放区职工联合会筹委会，于十五日为重庆劳协及福利机构被武装“接收”事向各国工会发出呼吁，其致世界职工联合会秘书长赛杨氏之原电如下：巴黎世界职工联合会赛杨先生并转法英美苏四国的工会鉴：
    中国的法西斯分子，为了进行大规模的内战，坚持独裁政治，对于中国胜利后的和平民主与统一的运动实行更进一步的残酷压迫，武装接收了重庆劳协的办事处和附属的福利事业机构，许多人员被捕，并以严刑拷打，他们想这样维持他们对于工人的统治。这种行为已经加诸各地了，如李公朴、闻一多的被暗杀，劳协的广东代表被扣留。今后的压迫必随着内战的扩大而加深，中国劳协的和平民主运动已受了严重的威胁，世界工联已确定的人类永久和平的决议已遭到了阻碍。我们解放区一百五十万工友，为了中国的和平民主，世界的人类和平，坚决反对这种非法行为。我们要和任何破坏劳协和平民主纲领和世界工联决议的企图作斗争，并希望你们给以声援。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】渝讯：此间各业工友连日纷纷投书新华日报，抗议国民党当局强占劳协的暴行。一群女工说：“劳协是我们工人的家，并不是政府和什么党团所办的“市总工会”，这个团体我们根本就不承认他有什么资格来“接收”，真是凶恶的法西斯行为！”一群司机工人说：“我们今天发动了广大的同业会员，要和‘总工会’力争一下，要争回为我们谋福利的劳协及被捕人员，我们一定力争到底。”江北工人代表愤慨的说：“劳协是合法的工人团体，并不是敌人，何能在青天白日之下武装抢劫？各界工友团结起来采取正义的行动！”一群汽车工人呼吁：“全体劳协会友及全国各业工友，不分地区团结起来，以我们的力量要求社会人士主持正义，请求政府依法处置，并向全世界的工人控诉。”某机器厂一群工友说：“本厂工人对于这件无理的事都异常愤慨。劳协为工人谋福利，无疑的我们工人是需要她和爱护她的，谁要来强占她，不但本厂同仁不答应，全重庆市、全国工人同胞一定都要站起来反对的！”
