How Beifengzheng Village Realized "Land to the Tiller"

Beifengzheng Village in Jize County, Southern Hebei, is a village where the mass movement progressed from rent and interest reduction to "land to the tiller." Its experience is worthy of study and reference in various regions. We hereby introduce it.

I. Land Ownership Status of Various Classes Before the Movement: (Before September 1945)

Land Ownership Statistics of Various Classes Before the Movement (Table 1)
    Class   Households   Population   Population Percentage   Land   Land per Person   Land Percentage
    Landlord   18   128   14.25   1890.87   14.78   35.52
    Rich Peasant   21   107   12.02   903.58   8.45   16.98
    Well-to-do Middle Peasant  9   61   6.78   405.11   6.64   7.61
    Middle Peasant   86   319   35.52   1543.66   4.84   28.81
    Poor Middle Peasant  6   21   2.44   68.36   3.25   1.28
    Poor Peasant   60   239   26.61   505.89   3.12   9.48
    Extremely Poor  10   23   2.55   5.00   .22   .09
    Total Village  210   898   5322.47   Total

From the above table, the following two issues can be seen:

(1) From the perspective of land relations:

The population of landlords and rich peasants accounts for 26.27% of the total population, and 52.5% of the village's land. The population of middle peasants (well-to-do, middle, poor), poor peasants, and the extremely poor accounts for 73.73% of the total population, and 47.5% of the village's land.

Judging from these figures, the land owned by landlords and rich peasants is not considered concentrated. At the same time, the land owned by hired laborers, poor middle peasants, and middle peasants does not seem so small. This is because this village used to be a guerrilla base area. After liberation in 1944, an anti-Japanese democratic village government was established. During that time, campaigns such as increasing wages, reducing rent, clearing debts, redeeming land, and opposing corruption and local bullies were carried out. The masses redeemed some land, weakening the feudal exploitation of landlords and rich peasants. Although the masses were not fully mobilized, and rent reduction and clearing of accounts were not thorough, the land ownership situation during the enemy and puppet rule had already been changed.

However, upon closer inspection, landlords and rich peasants owned an average of 11.61 mu of land per person, and it was the best-quality land. Hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants had an average of only 3.4 mu of land per person, and it was mostly the worst-quality land. The difference is vast. Therefore, it is natural for peasants to demand thorough rent reduction and clearing of accounts, to solve the land problem, and for tillers to have land to cultivate.

(2) From the perspective of class relations in the whole village:

Landlords and rich peasants account for 26.27% of the village's population, middle peasants (well-to-do, middle, poor) account for 44.74% of the village's population, and hired laborers and poor peasants account for 29.16% of the village's population. From this, it can be seen that the two extreme classes (landlords and rich peasants, and hired laborers and poor peasants) are small, and the middle class (middle peasants) is large. Middle peasants account for nearly half of the village's population.

This shows that in the struggles for rent reduction, wage increases, debt clearing, and opposing traitors and liquidating, as long as the interests of middle peasants are not harmed, and all middle peasants are united to participate in the struggle, they can possess the majority of 73.8% of the village's population. Otherwise, if the interests of middle peasants are harmed, causing some or most of them to withdraw from the struggle, not only will hired laborers and poor peasants be isolated, making victory difficult, but also middle peasants will not be liberated.

Among the landlord class, which accounts for 14.25% of the population, one-third are small and medium landlords, one-third are general landlords and those who contributed to the anti-Japanese war, and only one-third are traitorous bully landlords (the former two categories total about 9%, and the latter about 5%).

Therefore, if appropriate care is given to the 12% of rich peasants and the 9% of middle school students, general landlords, and landlords who contributed to the anti-Japanese war during and after the mass movement, then, with the power of the 73.8% basic mass advantage, it is entirely possible to completely isolate the 5% of traitorous bully landlords to their defeat, in order to achieve the complete liberation of the peasants.

II. Changes in Land Relations of Various Classes During the Movement

    Class   Land Sold   Land Relinquished   Land Confiscated   Land Redeemed   Total Land Lost

    Middle Peasant  50.94   123.337   72.67   54.277   301.224
    Poor Middle Peasant  17.50   4.000   4.20   25.700
    Poor Peasant  349.94   133.399   50.41   533.750
    Extremely Poor  61.50   19.320   14.70   4.000   99.520
    Total  479.88   293.056   141.98   54.277   973.194

Note: The above table is based on the changes after continuing to mobilize the masses from mid-October last year to carry out the rent reduction and account clearing movement until mid-January this year. The table was created in June this year. This village began the large-scale production movement in February this year.

The general process of this most recent thorough account clearing is:

Starting from chasing rent, interest, and capital, the movement encountered resistance and sabotage from bully, special agent, and landlord elements, thus turning to the struggle against these elements. This reached a climax in half a month, and then turned to in-depth clearing of old accounts, and struggles to reverse capital, rent, and interest, until the end of the movement.

Content of account clearing:

Confiscating the land and materials of the most heinous traitors, special agents, and landlords; clearing illegal land and materials of landlords and rich peasants who falsely mortgaged, falsely sold, and evaded burdens, as well as public properties, temple lands, lands for childless people, communal lands, ancestral shrine lands, etc., that they swallowed; clearing landlords' hidden land, unfair burdens, corruption, extortion, oppression of the masses, and other problems; chasing general landlords and rich peasants’ feudal exploitation of rent, wages, interest, labor exploitation, and other problems; and redeeming land, houses, livestock, etc., that peasants were forced to lose due to disasters and oppression.

In practice, five households of the most heinous bully and special agent landlords were struggled against by the masses, and their land and property were confiscated. However, their families (including adults, children, men, women, old, and weak) were re-assigned more than four mu of land to ensure their livelihood would not be a problem.

For general landlords, the masses simply reasoned, complained, and settled accounts. Compensation to the masses was made based on the family's living conditions, land, and property. Some returned more, some returned less, and some returned nothing. In general, each family was left with at least six mu of land per person, and their lives were still relatively comfortable.

For widowed and orphaned landlords, there were a total of five households with twenty-eight people. The masses did not clear their accounts. They had a total of 89 mu of land, averaging 11.19 mu per person, and they maintained their original living conditions.

In the figures in the above table, landlords lost a total of 996 mu of land. Excluding the five households of widowed and orphaned landlords, 473 mu were confiscated from the five households of bully landlords, accounting for half of the total. The remaining half, more than 524 mu, was cleared from eight households of general landlords, mostly through selling land to pay debts.

For rich peasants, in general, only wages and interest were cleared. For those who had other illegal damages to the interests of the masses, only their feudal exploitation portion was cleared, and their self-cultivated portion was retained. From the figures in the above table, it can be seen that among the 21 households of rich peasants, only 191 mu of land were lost, of which only 24 mu were confiscated, 54 mu were redeemed, and 27 mu were falsely relinquished. 87 mu were sold to pay debts.

Only one household of well-to-do middle peasants was struggled against, and ten shi and five dou of wheat were recovered because he lent money at high interest rates. Some middle peasants were also harmed in the land redemption, but later they were compensated with fruits and money for buying land during the movement. From the figures in the above table, it can also be seen that well-to-do middle peasants and middle peasants lost a total of 62 mu of land and gained as much as 313 mu of land.

The vast majority of middle peasants were not struggled against. Poor peasants, poor middle peasants, and hired laborers were not struggled against either. For those with problems within the basic masses, they were only criticized to admit their mistakes, and their property was not touched. Mediation was mostly used to resolve the issues.

Next, let me explain how the fruits of the struggle were distributed. The distribution of fruits of the struggle can be seen from the figures in the above table. A total of 1247.72 mu of land was cleared, and the basic masses were distributed 973.19 mu. Among them, 9 households of well-to-do middle peasants gained 13 mu of land and lost 12 mu, with a surplus of 1 mu; 86 households of middle peasants gained 301 mu of land and lost 50 mu, with a surplus of 259 mu; 6 households of poor middle peasants gained 25.7 mu of land; 60 households of poor peasants gained 553.75 mu of land; and 10 households of hired laborers gained 99.52 mu of land.

On average, each extremely poor person gained 4.33 mu of land, each poor peasant gained 2.23 mu of land, each poor middle peasant gained 1.24 mu of land, each middle peasant gained 0.79 mu of land, and each well-to-do middle peasant gained 0.02 mu of land. Generally speaking, the distribution ratio was appropriate. The extremely poor received twice as much as the poor peasants, the poor peasants received slightly less than twice as much as the poor middle peasants, and the difference between the poor middle peasants and the middle peasants was smaller. In practice, however, poor middle peasants, poor peasants, and the extremely poor received land of better quality.

A total of 1249.727 mu of fruits of struggle were obtained, and the basic masses were distributed 973.194 mu of land. The remaining 277 mu were distributed to the masses in other villages (177 mu) and rented to government agencies for production (100 mu), which are yet to be distributed. These are all government properties, temple lands, communal lands, and riverside lands, which are of poor quality.

III. Current Land Ownership Status of Various Classes After the Movement

Comparison Table of Land Ownership of Various Classes Before and After the Movement (Table 3)
    Class   Households   Population   Original Land   Land per Person   Existing Land   Land per Person   Average Increase/Decrease
    Landlord  18   128   1890.872   14.78   894.745   6.99   Decrease 7.79
    Rich Peasant  21   107   903.580   8.45   712.58   6.659   Decrease 1.75
    Well-to-do Middle Peasant  9   61   405.110   6.64   406.11   6.656   Increase .016
    Middle Peasant  86   319   1543.655   4.84   1794.279   5.624   Increase .79
    Poor Middle Peasant  6   21   68.360   3.25   94.06   4.479   Increase 1.24
    Poor Peasant  60   239   505.894   2.12   1038.644   4.345   Increase 2.23
    Hired Laborer  10   23   5.000   0.22   104.52   4.544   Increase 4.39
    Total   209   898   5322.471   5044.938

Note: The difference of 277 mu between the original land and the existing land is explained in the above text. 177 mu were distributed to the masses in other villages, and 100 mu were rented to government agencies for production and are yet to be distributed.

From this comparison table (Table 3), it can be clearly seen: as a result of the three-month thorough rent reduction and account clearing movement, among the 18 landlord households in the village, only one household of six people has the most land, with more than 60 mu. The remaining landlords have an average of 6.99 mu of land per person. Numerically, this is more than the peasants of other classes, but the quality of their land is poor, so in reality, it is not more than that of the peasants.

There are still 21 old rich peasant households in the village, maintaining their original class status, with an average of 6.66 mu of land per person (some good land and some bad land), only a decrease of 1.75 mu compared to their original land.

There are 9 households of well-to-do middle peasants, with an average of 6.657 mu of existing land per person, an increase of 0.016 mu compared to their original land. In reality, they have already risen to become new rich peasants. They received less land distribution but also received some material fruits (such as furniture, clothing, etc.).

The 86 households of middle peasants now have an average of 5.624 mu of land per person, an increase of 0.79 mu compared to their original land. Due to the adjustment of some good land and the distribution of some material fruits, they have actually risen to become well-to-do middle peasants.

The 6 households of poor middle peasants have an average of 4.48 mu of existing land per person, an increase of 1.24 mu compared to their original land; the 60 households of poor peasants have 4.34 mu of existing land, an increase of 2.25 mu compared to their original land; and the 10 households of hired laborers have 4.54 mu of existing land, an increase of 4.33 mu compared to their original land. Because most of it is good land and they also received some farm tools, grain, houses, livestock, etc., they have actually become middle peasants.

In short, landlords and poor and extremely poor people no longer exist in the village. The peasant land problem, which has existed for thousands of years, has been completely reformed, truly realizing the new democratic land system of "land to the tiller."

IV. New Atmosphere in the Countryside After "Land to the Tiller"

The peasant masses of Beifengzheng Village implemented the rent reduction policy, supported the War of Resistance Against Japan, defeated Japanese imperialism, liberated their hometown, and established a democratic regime. After the victory, in a short period of three months, they also carried out an earth-shattering land reform movement, completely eliminated feudal landlord exploitation, and realized the "land to the tiller" system, uprooting the poverty of peasants who had no or lacked land.

Their organized strength—currently there are 230 members of the peasant association, 200 members of the women's association, 60 members of the children's corps, 54 members of the sisters' corps, and 21 militiamen with six guns, totaling 565 people, accounting for 60% of the total population—takes hired laborers, poor peasants, and poor middle peasants as the core, uniting the broad masses of middle peasants to carry out struggles and control and consolidate the democratic village regime.

Having victoriously obtained land, the peasants enthusiastically plunged into the large-scale production movement. On the basis of past labor mutual aid organizations, they created a new type of agricultural production cooperative from spring to summer. They further uprooted the poverty of "peasants' individual economy and undeveloped productivity" and planted the rich roots of "developing agricultural capitalism."

Their agricultural production cooperative is called the "everyone is a landlord, everyone is a tenant" mutual aid society, also known as the "mutual aid society that converts the rent-tenant relationship into standard land and standard people" (Note: This form is suitable for old liberated areas, where the masses are highly conscious and the land problem has been thoroughly resolved).

The method is: Peasants participate in mutual aid groups on a voluntary basis. Each household completely contributes its land, labor, farm tools, farming cattle, fertilizer, and seeds to the public group (ownership still belongs to the original owner, and the public group only has the right to use them). The entire group collectively manages them, and the resulting harvest is divided according to work points, after paying rent to the original landlord.

The specific method: First, the land of each household is evaluated by the entire group according to the quality of the land, distance, degree of barrenness, and estimated harvest volume, and is determined as the standard mu; second, the labor force participating in the mutual aid group is evaluated into several shares according to physical strength and technical skill, and then work is calculated by the hour, and dividends are distributed according to work points; private ownership of farming cattle by group members is evaluated to offset work according to the size of the cattle; the farming cattle publicly owned by group members are purchased by dividing money among group members and are publicly raised and used within the group; half of the fertilizer is bought by dividing money among group members, and half is purchased publicly and used publicly according to the standard mu; when there is surplus labor in the group, it is combined with sideline businesses, and the profits earned by human labor are turned over to the public; the rent rate is 30% for the landlord and 70% for the group in the wheat harvest, and 40% for the landlord and 60% for the group in the autumn harvest, and firewood is distributed proportionally with the grain.

What are the results of their production mutual aid movement?

Four-fifths of the total population in the village participate in the mutual aid society. Most of the men, women, old, and young, full labor, and semi-labor of all classes participate in the mutual aid group and the weaving group. Each group enthusiastically competes and launches a production model movement. Idlers have been reformed, and there are no lazy people. Many production activists and production models have emerged.

The entire village makes production plans by household, each group has a production plan, and the entire village has a production development economic plan.

Productivity has been greatly improved. Ten people can do the work of twelve people, and sending meals from five families can save one worker. During the spring plowing, two hundred young people plowed more than twenty qing of land, saving two thousand workdays.

The cultivated area has been expanded. During the years of enemy and puppet rule, there was a lot of wasteland in the village. Landlords could not cultivate it and did not allow peasants to cultivate it. Now the wasteland has been eliminated. Deep plowing and careful cultivation are carried out. In the past, it was hoed twice, now it is hoed four times. In the past, fertilizers were not applied, but now they are.

The total production of the village has increased by more than one-third compared to before the land reform.

From this, it can be seen that in Beifengzheng Village, under the production conditions of "land to the tiller," peasants voluntarily organize themselves into agricultural production cooperatives and actively produce. In half a year, the development of productivity and the increase in production have achieved great results. The countryside has begun to show a thriving, production development, and economic prosperity new atmosphere. This is a new embryonic form and a new direction for the development of the new democratic economy in the countryside. Currently, during the implementation of land reform and the "land to the tiller" movement, the direction of Beifengzheng Village is worth referring to in various places.

Note: This material is based on the "Investigation Table of Land Changes Since the Mass Movement in Beifengzheng Village" and the oral reports of the county party committee, district party committee, and village cadres. The figures in the statistical tables (1), (2), and (3) are slightly different from the original statistical tables, which are the result of re-checking and counting each item.

Organized on August 24, 1946

　　北风正村如何实现了耕者有其田
    北风正村是冀南鸡泽县群众运动中由减租减息达到了耕者有其田的一个村庄，其经验，值得各地研究参考，兹特介绍。
    一、运动前各阶层土地占有状况：（一九四五年九月前）
    运动前各阶层土地占有统计表（一） 成分    户数  人口   人口   土地     每人   土地
                            百分比  平均地  百分比地主    18    128    14.25  1890.87  14.78  35.52富农    21    107    12.02   903.58   8.45  16.98富中农   9     61     6.78   405.11   6.64   7.61中农    86    319    35.52  1543.66   4.84  28.81贫中农   6     21     2.44    68.36   3.25   1.28贫农    60    239    26.61   505.89   3.12   9.48赤贫    10     23     2.55     5.00    .22    .09全村   210    898           5322.47共计
    从上表中，可以看出以下两个问题：
    （一）从土地关系上看：
    地主富农的人口，合计占全人口百分之二六·二七，占全村土地百分之五二·五。而中农（富、中、贫）贫农，赤贫的人口，合计占全人口百分之七三·七三，占全村土地百分之四七·五。
    从这个数字看，地主富农拥有的土地并不算集中，同时，雇贫中农拥有的土地也不像那样微少。这是因为：这个村庄以前是游击根据地，四四年解放后，即建立了抗日民主村政权，其间曾实行过增资减租清债，赎地，反贪污恶霸运动，群众有部分地赎回土地，削弱了地主富农的封建剥削。虽然群众发动不充分，减租清算不彻底，但已改变了敌伪统治时期的土地占有状况。
    但如果仔细研究的话，地主富农每人平均占地一一·六一亩，并且是地质最好的土地。而雇农、贫农、中农每人平均有地只三·四亩，又多是地质最坏的土地，相比相差甚为悬殊。因此，农民要求彻底减租清算，解决土地问题，耕者有地种，这是自然之理。
    （二）从全村阶级关系上看：
    地主富农占全村人口百分之二六·二七，中农（富、中、贫）占全人口百分之四四·七四，雇农和贫农占全人口百分之二九·一六，由此可见，两头阶层（地主富农与雇农贫农）小，中间阶层（中农）大，中农占全村人口将近一半之多。
    这说明了雇贫农在减租、增资、清债、反奸清算斗争中，只要不损害中农利益，团结全部中农参加斗争，就能拥有全村人口百分之七三·八的大多数，否则，损害了中农利益，使一部分或大部分脱离斗争，那就不仅雇贫农陷于孤立，难得胜利，中农亦将得不到解放。
    在人口比例占有百分之一四·二五的地主阶层中，有三分之一是中小地主，有三分之一是一般地主和对抗日有贡献的，只有三分之一是奸霸地主（前二类合计约占百分之九，后一类约占百分之五）。
    因此，在群众运动前后过程中，如果注意对百分之十二的富农及百分之九的中小学生，一般地主及抗日有贡献地主给以适当的照顾，那么，在百分之七三·八的基本群众优势威力下，使百分之五的奸霸地主完全孤立于失败，以求得农民的彻底翻身是完全可能的。
    二、运动中各阶层土地关系变动
    运动中各阶层土地变动统计表（二）成分      卖出地  推出地  斗去地  赎去地 共失地地主     440.297  82.75   473.08         996.127富农      86      27       24      54    191.000富裕中农                   12             12.000中农      40.6    10                      50.600贫苦中农贫农赤贫共计     566.897 119.75   509.08   54   1249.727成分    分得地   买回地  赎回地  追回地  共得地地主富农富裕中农          13                       13.000中农      50.94  123.337   72.67  54.277  301.224贫苦中农  17.50    4.000    4.20           25.700贫农     349.94  133.399   50.41          533.750赤贫      61.50   19.320   14.70   4.000   99.520共计     479.88   293.056 141.98  54.277  973.194
    附注：上表系根据去年十月半又继续发动群众，贯彻减租清算运动到今年一月半结束后的变化情况统计的，制表时间是今年六月，今年二月本村即已开始大生产运动。
    最近这一次的彻底清算大体的过程是：
    从追租、追息、追资开始，在运动中遇到恶霸国特地主的抵抗破坏，因而即转到反恶霸反国特地主的斗争，半个月即达高潮，继而又转向深入清算旧帐，倒资、倒租、倒息斗争，直到运动结束。
    清算内容：
    没收罪大恶极的奸霸、国特、地主的土地、物资；清算不法地主富农假当、假卖、逃避负担的土地，及吞没的公产庙地，绝户地、社地、祠地等；清算不法地主的黑瞒地，负担不公，贪污、讹诈、欺压群众等问题；追算一般地主富农封建剥削的地租、工资、利息，劳役剥削等问题；赎回农民因灾荒，欺压被迫失掉的土地、房屋、牲畜等。
    在作法上对罪大恶极的恶霸国特地主共五户，群众斗争后没收其土地财产，但给其家庭（成人、小孩、男女、老弱在内）重分配四亩多土地，保证生活没问题。
    对一般地主，群众只是说理诉苦算账，按其家庭生活土地财产状况赔偿群众，有的多退，有的少退，有的不退，一般的给其家庭每人至少留有六亩多地，生活还比较优裕。
    对孤寡地主，共五户，二十八人，群众没有清算，共有地八十九亩，每人平均一一·一九亩，仍保持原来生活状况。
    上表数字中，地主共失地九九六亩，除去五户孤寡地主外，五户恶霸地主被斗去四七三亩，将占全数一半，其余一半多五二四亩是从八户一般地主中清算出来，大部是出卖地还账的。
    对富农一般的只清算工资、利息，有其他非法损害群众利益者，只清算其封建剥削部分，保留其自耕部分。在上表数字中可以看出，在二一户富农中共失地一九一亩，其中被斗去的只二四亩，赎去的五四亩，假推地二七亩，有八七亩是卖出还账的。
    对中农只斗了一户富裕中农，追出十石五斗麦子，因他放高利贷。在赎地中也损害了几户中农，以后在运动中又分给他们果实买地补偿了。从上表数字中也可以看出，富裕中农与中农共失地六二亩，而共得地三一三亩之多。
    绝大多数中农没有挨斗争，贫农、贫中农、雇工也没有被斗的，基本群众内部有问题的，只是批评认错，不动其东西，多用调解方式解决。
    其次说明一下斗争果实地是怎样分配的，从上表数字中，就可以看出果实地分配情况。清算出的土地共计一二四七·七二亩，基本群众共分得九七三·一九亩。其中富中农九户共得地一三亩，失地一二亩，余得一亩；中农八六户共得地三○一亩，失去五○亩，余得二五九亩；贫苦中农六户共得地二五·七亩；贫农六○户共得地五五三·七五亩；雇工一○户共得地九九·五二亩。
    平均每人赤贫得地四·三三亩，贫农得地二·二三亩，贫中农得地一·二四亩，中农得地○·七九亩，富中农得地○·○二亩。分配比例一般说还适当。赤贫等于贫农二倍，贫农等于贫苦中农二倍弱，而贫苦中农比中农差额较小。但实际上贫苦中农、贫农、赤贫农多分得地质较好的地。
    斗争果实共一二四九·七二七亩，基本群众共分得地九七三·一九四亩，剩余二七七亩。其中让外村群众分去和清算去一七七亩，政府机关生产租用一○○亩尚待分配。均系官产、庙地、社地、河沿地，地质较差。
    三、运动后各阶层土地占有的现状
    运动前后各阶层土地占有对照表（三）成分    户数  人口  原有地    每人   现有地  每人    平均
                              平均地         平均地  增减地主    18    128   1890.872  14.78  894.745 6.99   减7.79富农    21    107    903.580   8.45  712.58  6.659  减1.75富中农   9     61    405.110   6.64  406.11  6.656  增.016中农    86    319   1543.655   4.84 1794.279 5.624  增.79贫中农   6     21     68.360   3.25   94.06  4.479  增1.24贫农    60    239    505.894   2.12 1038.644 4.345  增2.23雇工    10     23      5.000   0.22  104.52  4.544  增4.39共计   209    898   5322.471        5044.938
    注：原有地与现有地相差二七七亩，见上文说明，其中一七七亩让外村群众分去，租用政府机关生产一○○亩尚待分配。
    从这个对照表（三）里可以明显看出：三个月彻底减租清算运动的结果，全村地主一八户中，只一户六口人地最多，有六十多亩，其余的地主平均每人有地六·九九亩，就数字上比各阶层农民都多，但其地质较差，实际上并不多于农民的。
    全村尚有旧富农二一户，保持了原来成分，平均每人现有地六·六六亩（有好地有坏地），较其原有地只减少一·七五亩。
    富裕中农九户，每人平均现有地六·六五七，比原来地增加○·○一六亩，实际上已上升为新富农了。他们分地较少，但还分得一些物资果实（如家俱、衣服等）。
    中农八六户现在每人平均有地五·六二四亩，比原有地增加○·七九亩。因调剂了一些好地，并分得一些物资果实，实际上已上升为富裕中农。
    贫中农六户现有地平均每人四·四八亩，比原有地增加一·二四亩；贫农六○户现有地四·三四亩，比原有地增加二·二五亩；雇工工人一○户，现有地四·五四亩，比原有地增加四·三三亩。因大部是好地，并分得一些农具、粮食、房屋、牲口等，实际上已变成中农了。
    总之，全村地主与贫农，赤贫已不存在了，几千年的农民土地问题彻底得到了改革，真正实现了“耕者有其田”的新民主主义土地制度。
    四、耕者有其田以后农村的新气象
    北风正村的农民群众实行了减租政策，支持了抗战，打败了日本帝国主义，解放了家乡，建立了民主政权。胜利后，短短三个月时间，又干了翻天覆地的土地改革运动，彻底消灭了封建地主剥削，实现了耕者有其田制度，挖掉了农民没有或缺乏土地的穷根。
    他们组织起来的力量——现有农会会员二三○人，妇女会二○○人，儿童团六○人，姊妹团五四人，民兵二一人，枪六支，共五六五人，占全人口百分之六○，以雇工、贫农、贫中农为核心，团结着广大中农群众进行斗争，掌握与巩固民主村政权。
    农民胜利的获得了土地，就热烈地卷进了大生产运动。在过去劳动互助组织基础上，从春季到夏季期间，又创建了新型的农业生产合作社。进一步去挖掉“农民个体经济，生产力不发展”的穷根，按上“发展农业资本主义经济”的富根。
    他们的农业生产合作社叫做“人人为地主，人人为佃户”的互助社，也叫做“租佃关系折合标准地标准人互助社”（注意：这种形式适合于老解放区，群众觉悟程度较高，土地问题解决彻底的地区）。
    其办法：农民在自愿的原则下参加互助组，各户将其土地劳力农具耕牛肥料种子完全入公组（所有权仍属原主，公组只有使用权）全组集体经营，所得收获物除向原地主交租外，其余的由全组劳力，按工分红。
    具体作法：先将各户土地按地质好坏，距离远近，荒芜程度，估计收获量大小，由全组人评议定为标准亩；次将参加互助组的劳力按体力大小，技术高低，评议成几分股，然后以时计工，以工分红；耕牛组员私有的按牛力大小评议顶工，组员公有的按人股摊钱购买归组内公养公用；肥料是一半按人股摊钱，一半按标准亩摊公买公用；组内有剩余劳动力时即结合经营副业，人力计工赢利归公；佃租率，麦收顺三七批（原地主得百分之七十，组内得三十）秋收倒四六批（原地主得百分之四十，组内得百分之六十），柴草随粮分批。
    他们的生产互助运动的成果如何呢？
    全村参加互助社的占总人口五分之四，各阶层的男女老少全劳力半劳力大部都参加了互助组，纺织组，各组热烈竞赛，开展生产模范运动，二流子改造了，没有一个懒汉，涌现出不少生产积极分子和生产模范。
    全村按家订生产计划，各组有生产计划，全村有生产发展经济计划。
    生产力大大的提高了，十人能做十二人的活计，五家送饭可省一个工。在春翻地时二百青年翻地二十多顷，节省两千个工。
    耕地面积扩大了。敌伪统治年月，全村荒地很多，地主种不了，也不让农民耕种，现在荒地消灭了。深耕细作，过去锄两遍，现在锄四遍，过去不施肥的都施肥了。
    全村生产量比土地改革以前提高三分之一以上。
    由此可见，北风正村，农民在耕者有其田生产条件下，就自愿的组织起来农业生产合作社，积极生产，在半年中生产力的发展，生产量的增加，已有很大成绩，农村开始呈现了欣欣向荣，生产发展，经济繁荣的新气象。这是新民主主义经济在农村中发展的一个新雏型，新方向。目前正值实行土地改革，耕者有其田运动之际，对北风正村的方向是值得各地参考的。
    注：这个材料，是根据“北风正村群运以来土地变化调查表”，和县委，区委及该村干口头报告的材料，整理出来的，统计表（一）（二）（三）内，各项数字与原统计表略有出入，是重新逐项校对统计的结果。
