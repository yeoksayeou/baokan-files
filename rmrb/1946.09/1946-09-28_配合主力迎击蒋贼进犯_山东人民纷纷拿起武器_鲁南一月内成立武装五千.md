　　Coordinating with the Main Force to Repel Chiang Bandit's Invasion
　　Shandong People Actively Take Up Arms
　　Over 5,000 Armed Personnel Organized in Lunan Within a Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 25th] The people of Shandong are actively taking up arms to coordinate with the main force in repelling Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. In the recent month, in counties such as Tengxian and Lincheng in Lunan, nearly 5,000 armed personnel have been organized. In counties such as Xintai and Mengyin in central Shandong, 3,000 young people have also joined the army. The chairman of the Youth League in the Chengnan district of Xintai led fifteen young people to join the army, and swore an oath "to resolutely fight to the end, and not return until there is peace." Zhang Xianchi, a teacher at Gaojiazhuang Primary School, also signed up to join the army. He said, "A son joining the war to defend his hometown is precisely filial piety; a husband joining the army is precisely for a long-term reunion in the future." The first group of more than 1,300 new soldiers from Xintai County have arrived at the garrison of the Jiaoji Brigade. Di Wenyi from Xizilai Village in Mengyin was about to get married, and when he signed up to join the army, the district advised him to get married before joining the army, but he firmly said, "It won't be too late to come back and get married after defeating the reactionaries." In Lin Yi County, Bin Hai District, more than 580 people joined the army in one week. An eighty-year-old man in the Ai Shan district, leaning on his crutches, sent his grandson to join the army, saying, "I am old, let my grandson go fight, our descendants will all go fight, and we are not afraid that Chiang's army cannot be defeated!" Cai Huifeng, a veteran of honor in Boxing County, Bohai District, signed up to go to the front line again. At the farewell meeting with the villagers, he said, "I was injured fighting the Japanese devils. Today, Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the support of the American reactionaries, is attacking the liberated areas again. My illness is cured, and I have to fight him to the death!" Model military dependent Zhou Da Niang from Jingyuan (i.e., Yanshan County) sent her third son to join the army for the third time. She said, "I have four sons. The eldest son sacrificed in the war against the Japanese devils, and the second son is still in our regular army. This time, I am sending the third son to join the army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, this bad egg."
