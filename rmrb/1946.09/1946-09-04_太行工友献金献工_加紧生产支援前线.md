　　Taihang Workers Donate Money and Labor
    Speed Up Production to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi on the 31st] Workers from various regions attending the training class of the Taihang Federation of Trade Unions have launched a donation campaign to support the self-defense war. Wang Fengliu, a worker at the Fourth District Bomb Factory, has donated all his surplus wages, except for living expenses, until Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is crushed. Yang Yongx, on the other hand, donates one week's wages every month, and other workers have also volunteered to donate unpaid labor. The Federation has also received letters from workers in Jiaozuo, Liuhegou, Shigoujie Coal Mine, Xingtai, and other places, who have proposed increased production plans and participation in workers' armed forces to defend factories and mines.
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi on the 2nd] All the staff and workers of the Taihang Industrial Research Institute and its Construction Experimental Factory have launched a donation campaign of money and labor to support the patriotic self-defense war. At the general meeting of the staff and workers of the institute on the evening of the 26th, factory storekeeper Yang Ligong proposed to intensify work, improve work efficiency, and save materials. He said, "I haven't been home for eight years of the war of resistance. This time my hometown of Zhaocheng County was recovered, and I originally wanted to go back and see it, but today I am determined not to go back. I will clean up the warehouse recently to make the storage more scientific and clean up all the usable waste iron." Most of the workers donated voluntary labor. Wang Xingwang, a weaver at the textile factory, volunteered one hour of unpaid labor and two Sundays of work every day. The factory furnace workers guaranteed to produce 200 catties more molten iron per furnace. Donations of money were even more enthusiastic. The director of the institute donated 500 yuan, cadre Li Yingbin 1,000 yuan, Tang Kemin 1,000 yuan, worker Liang Chengzhi 1,000 yuan, and others donated from one hundred to several hundred yuan each, totaling 10,995 yuan, and 58 days and six hours of unpaid labor. In addition, the staff and workers of the Taihang Xinhua Daily and the Xinhua Branch have also launched a savings and donation campaign. Most of the cadres donated the supplementary food allowance they should receive from September to the end of the year to the self-defense war. The editorial board of ten people alone donated more than 19,000 yuan. This donation campaign is in full swing in various agencies in Taihang. Cadres are willing to use their savings to enrich the material strength of self-defense.
