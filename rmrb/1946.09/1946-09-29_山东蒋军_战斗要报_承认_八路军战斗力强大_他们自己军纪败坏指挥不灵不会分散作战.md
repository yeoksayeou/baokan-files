Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 26th: In the victorious battles of the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army at Tai'erzhuang, Daxing, Zhilanzhuang, and other locations along the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, "Combat Reports" of the 54th Army and the 8th Army Political Department of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were captured. These reports revealed the weaknesses of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the strong fighting will of the Eighth Route Army. The report described the battle situation at the time, stating: "On July 28th, at 9:00 AM, the entire 5th Division of the Communist Army, approximately one thousand strong, attacked the 1st Battalion of our 12th Regiment at Zhilanzhuang... First, they bombarded fiercely with artillery, followed by the throwing of numerous explosives and hand grenades. The sound of guns and cannons shook the earth, and the shouts of killing surged like an avalanche. They launched six successive fierce attacks... However, due to being outnumbered and our side's ineffective command, the frontline bunkers were eventually breached. The Communist Army continued to charge forward under fire, and our troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to the railway station and the village, holding onto two strongholds. After two hours, the Communist Army again launched a full-scale siege on the bunkers held by our 6th Company in the village, eventually leading to exhaustion of ammunition and no reinforcements, the fortifications completely destroyed, and the entire company of officers and soldiers sacrificing themselves."

The 54th Army of Chiang Kai-shek analyzed the reasons for this battle's failure as follows: (1) The commander was overly arrogant, and officers and soldiers lost control, resulting in ineffective command. (2) Poor shooting discipline. (3) Lack of individual combat capability. (4) Slow communication. In this regard, we must admit the advantages of the Eighth Route Army in military aspects: (1) Skilled in guerrilla warfare and night combat, with a spirit of sacrifice. (2) Good at using guerrilla tactics, acting quickly, and having accurate intelligence. In political aspects: (1) The army is politicized, with military and political coordination as one. (2) Particularly good at mass mobilization and propaganda work.

　　山东蒋军“战斗要报”承认
　　八路军战斗力强大
　　他们自己军纪败坏指挥不灵不会分散作战
    【新华社莱阳二十六日电】胶东八路军在胶济路东段台上、大行、芝兰庄等胜利战斗中，曾缴获蒋军五十四军及第八军政治部的“战斗要报”，其中透路了蒋军弱点和八路军的战斗，意志旺盛，该报告描写当时战斗情形称：“七月二十八日上午九时，共军第五师全部约千名，向我芝兰庄之十二团第一营进攻，……先以炮猛轰，继以多数炸药及手榴弹投掷，一时枪炮之声震天撼地，喊杀之声排山倒海，蜂涌冲杀，反复猛攻者六次。………然终因敌众我寡，加以我方指挥不力，第一线碉堡终被突破，而共军仍冒弹冲杀，我军不支，分别退至车站及村中死守两据点。历二小时之久，共军复以全力围攻我第六连据守村中之碉堡，终至弹尽援绝，工事尽毁，全连官兵随之牺牲。”
    蒋军五十四军检讨这次战斗失败的原因为：（一）指挥官过于骄傲，官兵失却掌握，指挥不灵。（二）射击纪律不良。（三）无个别作战能力。（四）联络不敏捷。于此，不得不承认八路军之优点，在军事方面：（一）长于游击战与夜间战，抱有牺牲精神。（二）善用游击战术，行动迅速，情报确实。政治方面：（一）军队政治化，军政配合一体。（二）特长民运工作与宣传工作。
