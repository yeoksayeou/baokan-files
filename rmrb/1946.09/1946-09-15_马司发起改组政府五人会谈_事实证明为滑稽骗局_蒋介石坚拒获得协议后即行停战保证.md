Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th—The five-person talks initiated by Marshall and Stuart in late August regarding the reorganization of the National Government have reached a deadlock, proven to be a ridiculous deception aimed at luring the Communist Party into joining the government to jointly suppress the Communists, as Chiang Kai-shek firmly refused to guarantee an immediate ceasefire after an agreement was reached. It is generally speculated that the purpose of Marshall and Stuart's initiation of these talks, with Stuart as the American representative (the other four belonging to the KMT and CCP), was to salvage the impression that American mediation had completely failed, as indicated by Marshall's statement on August 10th. Most American舆论believes that since American mediation has failed, U.S. troops should be withdrawn from China, and aid to Chiang should be stopped. However, both troop deployment and aid to Chiang are insisted upon by Washington. In view of the unfavorable situation, Marshall avoided the immediate ceasefire and the reopening of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), both requested by various parties in China but opposed by Chiang Kai-shek, and initiated the five-person talks among the KMT, CCP, and the U.S. to provide a facade for Washington. Regarding these talks, the CCP indicated that the increasingly fascist evil government of Chiang Kai-shek urgently needed to be reorganized in accordance with the PCC resolutions. Although the CCP clearly knew that the Chiang side had no sincerity whatsoever, in order not to give up any opportunity to achieve peace and implement the PCC resolutions, it did not refuse to participate in such "informal" talks, so as to submit the preliminary results to the PCC for decision. However, the CCP believes that the purpose of reorganizing the government is to achieve peace and democracy, rather than to serve as a cheap decoration for Chiang Kai-shek to continue his dictatorship and civil war, and for Washington to continue aiding Chiang's dictatorship and civil war. The premise of these talks should be that the Chiang and U.S. sides guarantee an immediate ceasefire after the agreement is reached, and withdraw the five absurd demands made by the Chiang side that led to the breakdown of the June talks. As the die-hard representatives of the Chiang side refused to make this minimum guarantee, Marshall went to Lushan on July 7th. As expected, it was confirmed that Chiang Kai-shek himself was even more die-hard than his representatives. The only remaining question is whether the U.S. government, which insists on continuing aid to Chiang, is willing to stop the Chinese civil war it has created. It is reported that the U.S. side has stated that the U.S. is unable to stop the civil war being waged by Chiang Kai-shek, but can only make some criticisms when absolutely necessary. The neutral opinion circles in Nanjing and Shanghai believe that the U.S., which claims to be mediating, is only capable of supporting Chiang's civil war but unable to stop it, which is even more ridiculous than asking the Communist Party to participate in suppressing the Communist Party. According to those familiar with the inside story, although Marshall is facing a serious situation in China today, this situation is only the predetermined result of American policy. The recent sale of materials to Chiang, sponsored by Marshall, shows that Marshall does not oppose the expansion of the Chinese civil war. What troubles Marshall most now is that he can no longer conceal the American policy of creating and expanding the Chinese civil war, and the resulting failure of American mediation. Marshall's responsibility is undeniable, and his influence and credibility have fallen to their lowest point since he came to China.

　　马司发起改组政府五人会谈
    事实证明为滑稽骗局
    蒋介石坚拒获得协议后即行停战保证
    【新华社延安十二日电】八月底，马歇尔、司徒雷登所发起的关于改组国民政府的五人会谈，由于蒋介石坚拒获得协议后即行停战的保证，已证明为诱使共产党参加政府以共同讨伐共产党的滑稽骗局而陷于僵局。马司两氏发起该项会谈，并以司徒为会谈中的美方代表（其他四人分属国共两党）。一般推测，其目的是在挽救八月十日马司声明所造成的美国调处已完全失败的印象。美国大多数舆论认为美国调处既已失败，自应撤退驻华美军，并停止援蒋，但驻军与援蒋两项适为华盛顿所坚持者。马歇尔氏鉴于形势不妙，乃避开中国各方所要求、而为蒋介石所反对的立即停战与重开政协两事，而发起国共美三方的五人会谈，以为华盛顿粉饰门面。对于该项会谈，中共方面表示日趋法西斯化的蒋介石恶政府，确需依政协决议迅速改组，中共虽明知蒋方没有任何诚意，但为不放弃任何一个获得和平与实现政协决议的机会，仍不拒绝参加此种“非正式的”会谈，以便获得初步结果后，提交政协会决定。但中共方面认为改组政府的目的既是实现和平民主，而非为蒋介石继续独裁内战与华盛顿继续援蒋独裁内战的廉价装饰。此项会谈的前提，当为蒋方与美方保证会谈协议后即行停战，并撤销破裂六月会谈的蒋方五项荒谬要求。由于死硬的蒋方代表拒绝作此项最低限度的保证，马歇尔乃于七月七上庐山，依照预料证实蒋介石本人比他的代表还要死硬以后，存下的唯一问题，便是坚持继续援蒋的美国政府愿否制止他所制造的中国内战。据悉：美方曾表示美国无力制止蒋介石所进行的内战，只可以于最后必要时作某种批评。京沪中立舆论界对自居调处的美国，只有力支持蒋之内战而无力予以制止的论调，认为较之要求共产党参加讨伐共产党一事更为滑稽。据熟悉内幕者透露：马歇尔氏虽面临今日中国严重之时局，但此种局势仅为美国政策的预定结果。由马氏赞助美国最近售蒋物资一事，即可见马氏并不反对中国内战的扩大。马氏现在所最苦恼者，乃是他已无法再事掩饰美国制造并扩大中国内战的政策，及由此而来的美国调处的失败。马氏责任无可推卸，而他的作用与信誉则已降至其来华后的最低点。
