　　Anyang People Sing War Songs and Intensively Harvest Crops
　　350 Villages Complete Early Grain Harvest
　　Joint Defense Organized, Autumn Harvest Defense Committee Established
　　No Straw Enters Villages, No Grain Enters Houses—Beware of Chiang Kai-shek's Ruthless Wolves!
　　[Our Newspaper, Anyang, 22nd dispatch] "Organize mutual aid for a busy autumn harvest. Harvest quickly, thresh quickly, dry and store quickly, beware of Chiang Kai-shek's ruthless wolves, don't let them snatch a single grain."
　　This is the war song of the masses in the old and new areas of Anyang during the intensive autumn harvest. More than 350 villages in the county have finished picking the first crop of cotton, and harvesting early grain, millet, and tobacco. In the Sixth District, Shuangquan, Guyan, and 39 other villages, 20,000 farmers picked 21,540 mu of cotton, harvested 19,300 mu of early grain, 2,800 mu of autumn vegetables, and 4,750 mu of tobacco in ten days. In conjunction with the autumn harvest, all villages are universally carrying out war preparations, deciding that "men dig caves, women store things," "straw and firewood do not enter villages, grain does not enter houses," and "do not transport stalks, only cut ears, leaving them piled up in the fields." Many villages have formed large joint defenses to prevent Chiang's puppet troops from seizing grain, and established armed autumn harvest defense committees. The village chief, farmers' association chairman, military affairs committee director, and militia captain are responsible for the front-line command, leading the militia to carry out guerrilla warfare to cover the rear's autumn harvest. Deputy village chiefs, deputy farmers' association chairmen, and finance and grain committee members, and other cadres lead the autumn harvest, war preparations, grain storage, and planned relocation sites in the rear, directing retreat routes. Chen Xiaotun is close to the enemy and has few cotton pickers, so the autumn committee called on Dongxi Gaoping to organize more than 30 women to help. The masses in both villages said with smiles: "This is really like one family." In the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Districts, more than 20 occupied villages, the escaped refugees have been organized to be protected by the militia for emergency harvesting. Digging caves is also actively underway; the Sixth District alone has dug 860. The 30 mutual aid groups in Nanduan Village originally had enough caves for 30 groups, but fearing that the refugees fleeing from the front would have no place to store their things, each group dug an extra one specifically for them. The village self-defense forces are taking advantage of the moonlight to make stone mines. The Duancun joint defense has completed 600, and the Tianxi town base point in the Seventh District has completed more than 1,000. The masses said: "There are people, there are stones, make a few more watchdogs, let the sons of bitches search and go wherever they want!" It is expected that the autumn harvest in the old and new areas will be successfully completed in early October.

　　安阳人民高唱战歌紧张秋收
    三百五十村收完早谷 
    合组大联防成立保卫秋收委员会
    草不进村粮不进房提防蒋家狠心狼！
    【本报安阳二十二日讯】“组织互助秋收忙。快收，快打，快晒藏，提防那蒋家狠心狼，不让它抢走一颗粮”。
    这是安阳新老区群众在紧张秋收中的战歌，该县有三百五十多个村庄，已摘完头遍花，收完早谷、黍稷和烟叶。六区双全、固堰等三十九个村庄的两万农民十天中摘了两万一千五百四十亩棉花，收割了一万九千三百亩早谷，两千八百亩秋菜，四千七百五十亩烟叶。结合着秋收各村普遍进行备战大动员，决定“男打洞，女收藏”，“柴草不进村、粮食不进房”。“不运秆、光割穗，留在地里堆成堆”。许多村庄为防止蒋伪军抢粮已合组大联防，成立武装保卫秋收委员会。村长、农会主席、武委会主任和民兵队长负责前方指挥部，领导民兵开展游击战争，掩护后方秋收。副村长、副农会主席和财粮委员等干部在后方领导秋收、备战、藏粮、计划转移地点，指挥退却路线，陈小屯离敌人较近，摘花人手又很少，秋委会号召东西高平组织了三十多个妇女去帮忙，两村群众笑嘻嘻都说：这真像一家人一样，在四、五、八等区，二十余个沦陷村庄，逃出来的难民已组织起来由民兵掩护抢收。打洞工作也在积极进行，仅六区就打了八百六十个。南段村三十个互助组，本来三十个洞就够用，因怕前边逃来难民的东西没地方存，每组又多打了一个专给他们用。各村自卫队，趁着月夜打石雷，段村联防已完成六百颗，七区天喜镇基点，已打成的一千多个，群众说：“有的是人，有的是石头，多打几个看家狗，任凭它狗日的往那里搜来那里走！”预计新老区十月初即可胜利完成秋收。
