　　Fire Line Short Ballads
　　The Second Squad of the Second Platoon of the Sixth Battalion of the Forty-ninth Regiment had a total of eleven comrades. While climbing the wall of the city of Lanfeng, the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and one soldier were the first to be wounded. After occupying the position on the city wall, another five were wounded. When rushing down the city wall to advance into the street center, two more comrades were wounded. The entire squad was left with only Comrade Qi Hexiang. At this moment, he paused for a moment, and said with great indignation, "Even if I am the only one left, I will fight to the end!" After saying this, he wiped his bayonet, held his gun in one hand, and a grenade in the other, and then followed the Sixth Squad to charge down, pursuing the enemy who had launched a tenacious counterattack against them. When the battle ended, he had six guns hanging all over his body, and a box of American-made bullets on his shoulder. He slowly walked back to his company with a smile on his face. The comrades applauded his return, congratulated him on his victory, and warmly offered him water and food. But he didn't answer a word to the comrades, because his ears had been deafened in the battle and he couldn't hear what the comrades were saying.

　　Comrade Yang Shutian, a soldier of the First Company of the Fiftieth Regiment, threw back more than a dozen enemy grenades when fighting in Fanjiazhuang. The entire company admired him and elected him as a hero in killing the enemy. When fighting at the Lanfeng Railway Station, he was very calm. Once, when the enemy counterattacked, their squad leader was a little flustered. He said, "The combat mission must be resolutely completed. The higher-ups said: there is only advance, no retreat. Whoever retreats will be disciplined. If you want to retreat, you are responsible, I am not responsible." Due to his persistence, the task of defending the position was completed. He was wounded in the Yanlinfu battle. He said, "I am from Shandong, and my home is in the base area. Don't look at me being old, I will work for a few more years after my injury heals. If something happens to me, I hope the higher-ups will give me a certificate to take back, saying that I have worked in the revolutionary ranks and served the people, and washed away the past." (Because he came from the Pinghan Campaign)

　　火线短曲
    六○四九二连二班共有十一个同志，在爬兰封城墙时，正副班长和一个战士首先挂彩，占了城上阵地后，接着又负伤了五个，冲下城墙向街心发展时，又有两个同志负伤，全班只剩下齐贺祥同志一个人。这时他脚顿了一下，很愤恨的“唉”了一声说：“就我一个人，也要干到底！”说了后，擦了擦刺刀，一手持枪，一手提着手榴弹便又跟着六班冲下去，追击向他们曾经进行过顽强反扑的敌人。战斗结束了，他身上横竖挂了六枝枪，肩上还扛着一箱美造子弹，满面笑容的慢慢走回自己的连里，同志们拍手欢迎他的回来，庆贺他的胜利，亲热的让他喝水、吃饭，但他总是不答同志们一句话，原来他已经在战斗中把耳朵震聋了，听不到同志们说的是什么。

    杨书田同志，是六○五○第一连的战士，打范家庄时，敌人手榴弹扔过来，他又接着扔回去十几个，全连人都很佩服他，选他为杀敌英雄；打兰封车站时，他很沉着，有一次敌人反扑过来，他们的班长有点慌了，他就说道：“战斗任务要坚决完成，上级说：只有前进没有后退，谁要后退就用纪律，你要退你负责任，我不负责任。”由于他的坚持，完成了坚守阵地的任务。阎林府战斗他负了伤，他说：“我是山东人，家在根据地，不要看我年纪大，伤好了还要干几年，如果有个一长二短，希望上级给我写个证明信捎回去，说我在革命队伍上干过，为人民服务过，把过去那一段洗掉。”（因他是平汉战役过来的）
