　　Military Region Commentator's Assessment:
　　Warmongers Who Treat the People as Enemies, Though Armed with American Weapons, Are Bound to Perish
　　Chiang Kai-shek Persists in His Errors and Continues to Invade Hebei, Shandong, and Henan
　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan, 13th] Under the valiant self-defense counterattack of our military and civilians in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the four brigades of Chiang’s troops (formerly four divisions) under the personal command of Chen Cheng, Liu Zhi, and Fan Hanjie were completely annihilated on the 6th. Among them, the Third Tank Battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line semi-American-equipped Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army) was completely disarmed in the field away from the transportation lines. Before this offensive, Bai Chongxi had personally gone to Xinxiang to mobilize the troops, saying: "Our army (Kuomintang army) has American weapons and will surely be able to eliminate the Communists." However, the captured officers and soldiers became very dejected when they mentioned this. They said: "Once the tanks left the transportation lines, they were attacked by the military and civilians of the liberated areas everywhere. The further we advanced, the less support we had. Finally, when the bullets ran out and the gasoline was used up, we had no way to deal with it." The Military Region Commentator pointed out: These officers' frank statements have provided a clear summary of the Kuomintang's warmongering clique. These warmongers, who are obsessed with national betrayal and dictatorship, only know how to rely on the superior weapons of American imperialism to carry out civil war, but they do not know that the consumption of superior weapons is even greater, requiring more massive rear-area supplies. The Kuomintang civil war clique, which is wholeheartedly hostile to the people, will never receive the assistance of the people. Once this kind of American-equipped troops leave the transportation lines, they will find themselves trapped in the quagmire of the people's self-defense counterattacks everywhere, and ultimately be annihilated with "no way to deal with it." The commentator finally pointed out: This victory once again proves that the military and civilians in the liberated areas have the opposite superior conditions. Although they do not have American equipment, the national unity of patriotic self-defense enthusiasm and determination is far superior to the war-weary and anti-war Chiang Kai-shek American-equipped troops. Those warmongers who want to use American equipment to scare the Communist Party, or continue to attack us, will still find the graves of those American-equipped troops under the self-defense counterattacks of the entire liberated area's military and civilians, just like in this Hebei, Shandong, and Henan campaign.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 13th: Chiang Kai-shek's invading army has suffered a loss of six divisions in our two self-defense counterattacks. Civil war expert Chiang Kai-shek is still obsessed with his errors and is actively deploying to invade the heartland of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan again. On the eastern front, the Eleventh Division (formerly the Eighteenth Army), which departed from Xuzhou to invade Dingtao, has now advanced to the south of Ajin in Dingtao. On the southern front, the Fifth Army of Lu Qingquan's troops, which departed from Dangshan Mamuji to invade, has moved to Caoxian. On the western front, a part of the Fifty-fifth Division of Cao Fulin's troops is advancing from Mazhuangzhai and Shenji in Minquan to the Weiwai line northwest of Caoxian. The remnants of the Forty-seventh Division are gathering near Kaocheng. The Forty-first Division is gathering near Kaocheng and Changyuan. Sun Zhen's headquarters of the Fifth Appeasement District of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters is also advancing from Yangwu to Fengqiu. It is expected that a new and larger-scale invasion by Chiang's troops and our fierce self-defense counterattack battle are about to begin.

　　军区评论员评称
    好战分子以民为敌虽有美械亦必覆没       
    蒋贼执迷不悟续犯冀鲁豫
    【本报邯郸十三日电】在我冀鲁豫军民英勇自卫反击下陈诚、刘峙、范汉杰亲自指挥下的蒋军四个旅（即过去四个师）已于六日全军覆殁，其中蒋介石嫡系半美械化的第三师（即过去的第十军）的战车第三营于离开交通线的野战中即全被解除武装。在此次进攻前，白崇禧虽曾亲赴新乡动员：“我军（国民党军）有美国武器，一定能消灭共产党。”但这次被俘的官兵，一提及此事，即非常颓丧。他们说：“战车离开了交通线，到处遭受到解放区军民的袭击，越前进越无后援，最后子弹用完了，汽油烧光了，咱们也毫无办法了。军区评论员指出：这些军官们坦直的谈话，已替国民党好战集团，作了一个显明的总结，这些醉心卖国独裁的好战分子，只知依仗美帝国主义优良武器，进行内战，却不知优良武器的消耗更加巨大，需要更庞大的后方补给。一心与人民为敌的国民党内战集团，他们是永远得不到人民的援助的。此种美械化的部队，稍一离开交通线后，即处处陷入人民自卫反击的泥潭中，而至“毫无办法”的被歼灭。该评论员最后指出：这次胜利，再一次证明了解放区军民有着相反的优越条件，虽然没有美械装备，但全民一致的爱国自卫热情与决心，却远胜于厌战反战的蒋介石美械装备的部队。那些好战分子们，想以美械装备来吓唬共产党，或继续向我进攻，其结果仍将如这次冀鲁豫战役一样，那些美械装备的部队，在全解放区军民自卫反击下，一定会找到他葬身的坟墓的。
    【新华社荷泽十三日电】蒋介石进犯军在我两次自卫反击下，已损兵折将达六师之众，内战专家蒋介石仍执迷不悟，现正积极部署向我冀鲁豫腹心地区再度进犯，东线自徐州出发向我定陶进犯之十一师（原为十八军）现已进至定陶阿进以南，南线自砀山马牧集出发进犯之鲁清泉部第五军移至曹县，西线曹福林部五十五师一部自民权马庄寨、申集向我曹县西北的魏湾一线进犯，四十七师残部集结考城附近。四十一师集结考城、长垣附近，郑州绥署第五绥区孙震的总部并由阳武向封邱推进，预计蒋军新的更大规模之进犯与我猛烈之自卫反击战即将开始。
