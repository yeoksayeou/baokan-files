　　My Impressions of America
    爱伦堡 (Ailunbao)
    Editor's Note: Soviet News reporter Ailunbao, who traveled to the United States, published an article "My Impressions of America" in the New York Times on June 26 upon his departure from the United States and return to the Soviet Union, recounting his observations. We are publishing this article for our readers.

    In a few hours, I will be leaving the United States for Europe. I enjoyed my two-month stay in the United States immensely, thanks to the invitation of my American colleagues! I have seen many things in my life, but without visiting the United States, I cannot truly say that I understand the world and humanity.

    In New York, I saw a cigar that cost two hundred dollars, only to be smoked for a few days; in the Mississippi Delta, I saw an octogenarian gardener who earned only two hundred dollars a year.

    In America, I saw many idealists, and also some true slave drivers; I saw magnificent and grand universities, and also banquets hosted by "Lion's" clubs, where merchants of suspenders or electric stoves roared at the servants like lions, displaying their power.

    In Rockson City, Missouri, I once wanted to buy a drink, and someone told me, "Liquor is prohibited." Others advised me to drive to the neighboring state to buy it. When our car reached the border between the two states, someone beckoned us to cross the bridge and asked us to pay a dollar and a half, because the bridge was private, and the explanation I received was "We respect private property." From this, it can be seen that in some cases, the power of the American federal or state government is extremely great, but in other cases, the government has no power at all.

    If American journalists didn't keep saying that America has freedom and the Soviet Union lacks freedom, I wouldn't mention the following fact: I once lived in Tennessee, where teaching Darwin's theory of evolution was prohibited; as for our Soviet Union, anti-Semitic propaganda is prohibited.

    Which is better—prohibiting the theory of evolution, or prohibiting counter-revolutionary behavior? ...

    I also remember during the Yugoslav elections, some people were deprived of the right to vote because they regarded personal grievances as enemies. The American newspapers expressed great dissatisfaction with this matter. I have lived in Mississippi, where half the population has no right to vote.

    Which is better? To deprive those with a black conscience of the right to vote? Or to deprive those with black skin of the right to vote? ...

    In America, I saw many things of Christ, such as thousands of things that make life comfortable, the magnificent scenery of New York, the factories of Detroit, the huge Tennessee hydropower project, and the high standard of material life. But the most beautiful thing we saw was the malleability of the American people's spirit.

    The American people are young, sometimes reminiscent of a teenager. They have already achieved great technical achievements, and I believe they will certainly be able to create a new human culture, endowed with true wisdom, and possessing several noble qualities—straightforwardness and fortitude, diligence and strength. They bravely move forward, but not in a straight line, sometimes inevitably circling, taking detours, but they are always moving forward. This is an encouragement to us. The Americans will help humanity reach the gate of happiness together.

    In America, I have seen many things that I love, and also many things that I hate. When I return home, I have decided to offer strict criticism. I do not object to Americans criticizing our Soviet Union either.

    Some say that their reason for fabricating rumors is that the Soviet Union supposedly does not allow them to enter the country. However, I do know that there are many American journalists stationed in Moscow. Some report truthfully, some report distortedly, and some complain about the restrictions on their freedom, often saying that during their "wartime" travels in the Soviet Union, they were always accompanied by representatives of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

    During my travels in America, I was also accompanied by representatives of the State Department. Not only did we not complain about being restricted in our freedom, but we were also infinitely grateful for their concern.

    The attitude of both sides' authorities towards foreign journalists is obviously not directly related to their attitude towards their country and people. I visited America as a friend, specifically to observe and learn. However, among some of the journalists who have been to Moscow, there are clearly quite a few enemies of the Soviet Union. Before even entering Soviet territory, they already had a clear idea of what they would report.

    I plan to talk about the newspapers, because I feel deeply regretful about their attitude. Large and serious newspapers, in order to sensationalize, publish false reports about the Soviet Union, attempting to make people believe that war between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable.

    I want to loudly appeal: War will not happen! The soldiers on the Rhine and the Elbe, as well as the heroes who sacrificed in Stalingrad and Normandy, can guarantee it.

    In the two months of my visit to the United States, the anti-Soviet movement in America reached a climax. I really wanted to leave in anger, but I saw not only the newspapers, but also their readers. I know that the American people do not want war. They remember Stalingrad, and they have no ill will towards the Soviet people.

    The people of our two great nations are both great and noble. Why should we quarrel? Are our interests really in sharp conflict? No. What separates us is nothing but a fog created by slanderers who are preparing for a third world war.

    At this moment, I will apologize to my American friends. I want to say that I do not know when the people of our two countries will be able to love each other, when that foolish and disgusting talk about a third world war will end, when we will meet again like brothers. I do not know the time, but I do know the place: on the wreckage of fascist ideology.

    I believe that soon the American people will stop the tyrannical fascist elements and those who vainly attempt to launch a crusade to Moscow. At the same time, I want to affectionately tell America, thank you for your friendly hospitality, thank you for your kindness, thank you for your candor and sincerity! Goodbye!

### 我对美国的印象

　　我对美国的印象
    爱伦堡
    编者按：游美的苏联消息报记者爱伦堡，在离美返苏时，曾于六月二十六日在《纽约时报》发表我对美国的印象一文，历述观感。兹将该文刊载，以飨读者。                                           
    几小时后，我将离美赴欧，我在美勾留两月，承美国同业邀请，极感愉快！我生平已见过许多事物，但不访美国，实在说不上了解世界与人类。
    我在纽约看到过一种雪茄，售价二百元，只供几天抽吸；我在密士失必河三角洲又看到一个八旬园艺家，只赚二百元一年。
    我在美国看到过许多理想主义者，也看到了一些真正奴隶驱使者；我看到庄严伟大的大学，也看到“狮群”俱乐部主持的宴会，席间那种吊裤带或电灶商人，对仆役们咆哮如雷，其威武又如雄狮。
    在密苏里州罗克逊城，我有一次想买杯酒，有人对我说：“酒是禁止的”。另外有人劝我驾车到邻州去买，当我们车到达两州边界时，有人招呼我们过桥，要我们付一元半钱，因为桥是私桥，而人们对我的解释是“我们尊重私有财产”。由此可见，在有些情形之下，美国联邦或州的权力极大，但在另一种情形之下，政府竟毫无权力。
    如果不是美国记者老说美国自由而苏联缺乏自由，我想不提起下面这一事实：我曾在田纳西州居住，那里竟禁止讲解达尔文《进化论》；至于在我们苏联，反犹宣传是禁止的。
    那一种做法对呢——禁止进化论，还是禁止反革命的行为？………
    我还记得南斯拉夫大选时，有些人因为视颜事仇，被剥夺了选举权，美国报纸曾对这事情大表不满，我可在密士失必州住过，那一州有一半人口没有选举权。
    那一种做法好？取消黑良心的人的选举权好？还是取消黑皮胃的人选举权好？……
    我在美看到许多基督的事物，例如使生活舒适的几千种东西，纽约的壮丽景象，第特律的工厂，巨大的田纳西水电工程，以及高度的物质生活水准。但是，我们看到的最美丽的东西，还是美国人民精神上的可塑性。
    美国人民年青，它有时使人想到少年，它已经实现了技术上伟大的成就，我想信它一定能创造一种新的人类文化，它赋有一种真正的智慧，它有好几种高尚的特质，直率而刚毅，勤恳而有力，它勇敢向前，但不取直径，有时不免兜圈子、走冤枉路，但它始终在前进。这对于我们正是一种鼓励。美国人将协助人类共抵康乐之门。
    我在美国看到过许多我所喜爱的事物，也看了许多我所厌恶的事物，我回国时决定加以严格的批评。我对于批评我们苏联的美国人，也并不反对。
    有人说他们的所以造谣生事，是因为据说苏联不许他们入境，不过我确实知道，莫斯科驻有许多美国记者，有的据实报导，有的报导歪曲，有的抱怨着自由受了限制，常说他们“战时”在苏境游历，总有苏联外交委员会的代表奉陪。
    当我此番在美国游历时，我也有国务院的代表陪伴，我们不仅不怨自由受拘束，并且对于关切之情，无限铭感。
    双方当局对于外来记者态度，显然与对他们国家与人民的态度并无多大关系，我是以朋友的身份访美，专来观摩与求知，但是在有些到过莫斯科的记者中，显然有不少是苏联的仇敌，他们在未入苏境以前，对报导些什么，早已胸有成竹。
    我打算谈一谈报纸，因为我对于他们的态度深感遗憾，大而严肃的报纸为了耸人所闻，大登关于苏联的虚伪报告，企图叫人相信美苏两国不免战争。
    我要大声吁呼，战争不会发生，莱茵河与易北河上的兵士们、以及在斯达林格勒与诺曼第牺牲的英雄们，都可以为它保证。
    在我访美的两个月中，美国反苏运动正掀起了高潮，我真想一怒而去，但是我不仅看到了报纸，也看到了他们的读者，我知道美国人民并不要战争，他们记得斯达林格勒，他们对苏联人民并无恶感。
    我们这两个大国人民都伟大而高尚，为什么要争吵呢？我们的利益真有尖锐的冲突吗？没有，使我们隔阂不是别的，就是那些准备第三次世界大战的诽谤者所制造的一种迷雾。
    此刻我将向我的美国友人道歉，我要说我不知道什么时候我们两国人民能相亲相爱，什么时候那种愚蠢而厌恶的关于三次大战的言论会终止，什么时候我们再会像兄弟一般重逢，我不知道时间，但确知其地点，即在法西斯思想的残骸之上。
    我相信不久美国人民会制止暴虐的法西斯党人及妄想发动打到莫斯科的十字军的人们，同时我要亲爱地告诉美国，谢谢它友善的招待，谢谢它的好意，谢谢它的坦率诚恳！再见！
