　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 23rd: London dispatch: Labour MP, Mr. S.C. Silkin, delivered a speech to more than 500 of his constituents on the 21st, criticizing the government's current foreign policy. Mr. Silkin had just returned from a tour of Europe and received unanimous support from the Labour Party Executive Committee, Standing Committee, and Trade Union Standing Committee in his constituency. Mr. Silkin said: The time has come for the British people to realize that we are losing peace day by day and should rise up to find ways to stop this situation. He said he did not agree with Wallace's view that the United States was being held captive by British imperialism; on the contrary, Britain has gradually become subordinate to the goals and policies of the United States. However, he welcomed Wallace's ability to express the views of American liberals and trade unions. He said that Wallace proved the growing aversion of the American people to the trend of a Third World War, which would receive an appropriate response from the Soviet Union if British and American policies went further. Mr. Silkin called on the Labour government to take the necessary leadership role in stopping and reversing the trend of war. Mr. Silkin also called for the fulfillment of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty. Mr. Silkin's speech received unanimous trust from his audience. In answering questions, Mr. Silkin said that, to his knowledge, thirty or forty MPs agreed with his views.
