Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 2nd (Delayed) Except for the Central Daily News and Peace Daily News, all newspapers in Nanjing suspended publication for one day on and the day after Journalist's Day (September 1st) to protest the Kuomintang authorities' oppression of the press. Due to the soaring prices after the Kuomintang government's "adjustment" of foreign exchange rates, the livelihood of newspaper employees was thrown into panic. Newspaper offices were unable to cope with the sudden increase in expenses, especially the Nanjing Evening News. At this time, the Kuomintang's official newspaper, Central Daily News, deliberately raised employee salaries by 110% in an attempt to eliminate other newspapers and monopolize the market. Other newspapers, unable to afford this, were convened by Dagang Daily to discuss the issue. They decided to jointly petition the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department to stop the Central Daily News' behavior of destroying the industry, and to initiate the organization of a joint newspaper association. At the first preparatory meeting, it was decided that the salary increase for newspaper employees should not exceed 40%, otherwise, they would jointly suspend publication. However, Central Daily News and Peace Daily News declared that they would not be bound by this restriction, causing the planned establishment of the joint newspaper association on August 26th to be aborted. Subsequently, each newspaper separately discussed the issue of raising wages with the Federation of Trade Unions. The Nanjing Evening News had not reached an agreement by the 31st, and a strike occurred on the 1st. As a result, except for the Central Daily News and Peace Daily News, the remaining evening newspapers suspended publication on the evening of the 1st, and the daily newspapers suspended publication on the 2nd to express their protest against the authorities. A total of eleven newspapers suspended publication, including Dagang Daily, Dadao Daily, Dazhong Daily, China Daily, Construction Daily, Salvation Daily, New China Daily, Chaobao, Nanjing People's Daily, Capital Evening News, and Evening Journal. According to their nature, they can be divided into purely official, semi-official, and private.

　　南京各报停刊一天
    抗议当局迫害新闻界
    【新华社南京二日电】（迟到）南京全市报纸除中央和平两报外，于九一记者节之当日与翌日分别停刊一天，表示对国民党当局摧残新闻事业抗议。缘国民党政府“调整”外汇后物价飞涨，各报职工生活顿起恐慌，而各报馆无力应付突然提高之开支，尤其南京晚报为甚。＠于此时，国民党机关报中央日报故意将职工薪津提高百分之一百一十，以图消灭各报，独占市场，其他各报以不能负担，曾由大刚报发起邀集各报负责人会商，决定一面联合呈请国民党中宣部制止中央日报此种摧残同业之行为，一面发起组织各报联合会。在第一次筹备会中，决定各报职工增薪不得超过百分之四十，否则唯有联合停刊。但中央和平两报声明，不受此种约束，致使原定八月二十六日成立之各报联合会亦因而流产。此后各报分别与总工会商谈提高待遇问题，南京晚报至三十一日商谈未妥，一日发生罢工，因之除中央和平两报外，其余各晚报于一日晚停刊，日报于二日停刊，表示对当局之抗议。停刊报纸共十一家，为大刚、大道、大中、中国、建设、救国、新中华、朝报、南京人报、首都晚报、晚刊等，按其性质可分为纯官方者半官方者与民营三种。
