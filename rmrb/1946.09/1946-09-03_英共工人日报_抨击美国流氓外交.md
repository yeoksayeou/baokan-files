　　The British Communist "Worker's Daily"
    Condemns American Rogue Diplomacy
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: London dispatch: Several British newspapers have criticized the American "demonstration" in the Mediterranean. The British Communist "Worker's Daily" stated on the 28th that the American fleet's "visit" to the Mediterranean is a "blatant example of rogue diplomacy." The newspaper stated that it not only threatens the interests of the Soviet Union, but also threatens the interests of Britain. Driven by Wall Street and the big trusts, the American government is engaged in a frenzied march, trying to restore capitalism in Europe. The British Labour government's despicable flattery of American aggression not only endangers the social reforms desired by the British people, but also endangers world peace as a whole.

　　英共工人日报
    抨击美国流氓外交
    【新华社延安三十日电】伦敦讯：英国若干报纸对美国在地中海的“示威”加以抨击，英共工人日报二十八日称：美国舰队“访问”地中海是“流氓外交的昭著例子”。该报称：它不仅威胁苏联利益，而且威胁英国的利益。美国政府在华尔街与大托拉斯驱使下从事狂热的进军，想在欧洲恢复资本主义。英工党政府对美国侵略的卑鄙谄媚，不仅危害了英国人民所渴望的社会改革，而且危害了整个世界和平。
