　　Yan Xishan
    Admits to Losing Popular Support
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 17th] Yan Xishan wantonly wages civil war, and he himself admits to losing popular support. In a handwritten order from Yan Xishan seized by our army, dated June 28th, it stated: "We have suffered greatly due to unreliable intelligence, failing to achieve victory when we should have, and suffering great defeats when we should not have been defeated... The people give us false military information, sometimes reporting fewer troops than there are to contain our forces and disrupt our morale, and sometimes reporting more troops than there are to lure our forces into ambushes and encirclements." In the self-defense counterattack operations in the central section of the Tongpu Railway, as soon as our troops entered the areas under Yan's control, the masses eagerly volunteered to be guides, leading the Eighth Route Army to attack the Yan puppet troops who harassed the people. This "handwritten order" precisely reflects Yan Xishan's fear of the people's resistance movement.

### 阎锡山  自供失民心

　　阎锡山
    自供失民心
    【本报阳城十七日电】阎锡山恣意内战，自己承认失掉民心。我军曾缴获阎锡山六月二十八日手谕中称：“我们因情报不确实吃亏很大，该大胜而不胜，该不败而大败……………人民向我们假报军情，有时以少报多，牵制我们的队伍，扰乱我们的人心，有时以多报少，诱致我们的队伍受他们的伏击和围攻。”按此次八路军在同蒲中段自卫反击作战中，部队一进入阎军统治区，群众争先自愿为向导，带领八路军去攻击扰害人民的阎伪军。这一“手谕”正反映出阎锡山对人民反抗运动的恐惧。
