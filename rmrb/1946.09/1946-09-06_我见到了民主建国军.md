　　I Saw the Democratic National Construction Army
    Zhu Bo
    On the 22nd of this month, I arrived at the headquarters of the Democratic National Construction Army. The first thing that impressed me most was the soldiers' free and democratic songs that could be heard everywhere.
    It has been more than ten months since the Democratic National Construction Army's uprising. The relationship between officers and soldiers, and the relationship between the army and the people, are improving day by day, especially the relationship between the army and the people, which is being done even better. During the wheat harvest, the entire army, from the commander-in-chief to the odd-job men, participated in the wheat harvest. Even the sick and wounded participated. They formed groups, brought their own rations, and went to the outer villages to help the villagers with the wheat harvest. According to incomplete statistics, the First Division alone, in six days, contributed 8,150 workdays, harvesting more than 12,000 mu of wheat. Liang, the deputy officer of the First Division, after cutting wheat, said with sore legs and back: "Who knows that every grain on the plate is hard-earned. If I don't serve the people in the future, my conscience won't let me!" They were consoled and visited by 40 villages in the Fourth District. The villagers from these 40 villages brought gifts to participate in the army appreciation meeting. After the Eleventh Regiment helped the masses with production, the masses bought a lot of soap, towels, and cigarettes to comfort them, but they were all politely declined. But the masses felt bad, so they prepared to invite a theater troupe to perform. An old woman, because the troops did not accept her gifts, specially found a literate person to write a letter to the army. This letter was published in the Democratic Unity Newspaper, which read: "You are really our good army, helping us to cut wheat without even drinking water, how can I get over it!"
    Comrade Wang Hongjun of the Transportation Company of the Sixth Regiment of the Second Division rescued a child from the village in the river. The family was so grateful that they didn't know what to do.
    In the peasant liberation movement, the officers and soldiers of the Second Division first purged more than 20 landlords and despots who had infiltrated the troops and handed them over to the county for processing. Now the cadres of the Second Division have launched a land donation campaign (local cadres). Shi, the head of the Sixth Regiment, has already distributed part of his land to the masses. Now Division Commander Tian, ​​Battalion Commander Shi of the Sixth Regiment, and Company Commander Lian of the First Company of the First Battalion are all preparing to distribute their surplus land to the masses. The soldiers of the Special Task Regiment of the Headquarters helped the masses in the village with the fruits of the struggle. The struggle committee of the village wrote a letter of condolences to them to express their gratitude. Hu Guiting, a soldier of the First Company of the First Battalion of the First Regiment, said: "We were helping the rich to make a revolution against the poor in the rear. Now it's completely turned over." The deputy squad leader of the First Regiment said to the special agent who was being struggled against: "I live in your house, and you said to me: 'The Kuomintang army is still good.' You also undermined our soldiers to desert. What do you mean by this?" When the masses heard this, they immediately shouted "The Democratic National Construction Army is our own army,..." and the soldiers also echoed, shouting "Truly become public servants of the people, first help the masses to turn over!" Qiao, the army commander of the Second Army, wrote to the Shahe County Government saying: "At this time when the masses are turning over, our entire army will do everything in its power to help our fathers and elders turn over completely."
    The entire army has developed respect and love for the Eighth Route Army and Chairman Mao in the liberated areas. A soldier of the Second Regiment contributed an article to the Soldier's Life Newspaper praising Chairman Mao, writing: "He is the guide, he is the light in the darkness, we will always follow him." Another soldier wrote in the Soldier's Life Newspaper, "My good friend is the Eighth Route Army."
    Ma Hongde, a cook from the Second Battalion of the Tenth Regiment, is from Shahe County. He had not been home for nine years. This time, after returning home, the masses divided him two mu of green seedlings land that had been struggled for. The village office is responsible for planting the land. After he arrived at the regiment, others asked him, "Old Ma, how is your family?" Old Ma smiled so hard that he couldn't close his mouth and said, "The poor have turned over, and I have turned over too."
    He Fengyin, a quartermaster sergeant, is from Qingfeng County, Hebei Province. This time, after returning home, he saw that the house had collapsed and more than 20 mu of land were deserted. His wife had remarried due to the famine. He found the local democratic government and requested a reasonable solution. Now, with the help of the local government, a new house has been built, and his wife has returned through reasonable mediation by the government. The village is responsible for planting the land. The soldiers deeply feel that the government in the liberated area is a hundred times stronger than the government in the rear. Things that should be issued there are not given, and they don't care about your family problems there.
    "Officers and soldiers are united." Yin Shusen, the platoon leader of the Ninth Company of the Second Regiment, ran to the front in production and work after returning from the cadre training class. The soldiers said: "The platoon leader has made progress, let's make good progress too!" After studying, many company and platoon officers actively played an exemplary role in influencing the soldiers, and the soldiers also automatically strove for work. Li Zhenhua, a soldier of the First Regiment, went to the vegetable garden to plant vegetables and water the plants except for attending classes and standing guard. Sun, the head of the Special Task Regiment of the Headquarters, said: "In the past, officers held sticks and urged them to do a job, but the soldiers couldn't do it well, deliberately picking on you to make trouble, destroying furniture and breaking things. Now that there is work, they are rushing to do it, and they are doing it very well. This is all the benefit of implementing democracy."
    In the entire army, there is an atmosphere of mutual respect and love between officers and soldiers: Officers stay up late to check posts and check beds. These things have never happened before. Some soldiers proposed, "The cadres are too busy and tired, let's cook some other dishes for them to eat." But the cadres gratefully declined. Now, regardless of whether they are soldiers or officers, they can talk and laugh together outside of formal study. Soldiers of the Third Battalion of the First Regiment wrote in the criticism and suggestion column on the wall newspaper: "Comrade Battalion Commander! What did you do when you didn't study during the study session? Did your wife hold you back?" And the battalion commander replied on the wall newspaper: "I didn't participate in your study session because I was in a meeting. Not only can my wife not hold me back, but I also have to transform her." Soldiers could not have dreamed of such a thing in the past.
    Now the entire army has started production. Every unit has a small vegetable garden. Some can sell a part in addition to their own consumption. The Democratic National Construction School has planted nearly 300 mu of land. Each unit has a cooperative transportation company and a grocery store. Each soldier in the Special Task Regiment of the Headquarters has more than 1,000 yuan in savings. In addition, the First Division, the Second Division, and the Second Army have their own coal mines. Life has improved. They eat noodles once a day and rice once a day. In the past, they couldn't even eat salt. Now they can't finish the vegetables they produce. The Communications Battalion of the Headquarters is doing well in production and can eat meat twice a month. Wen, the director of the Military Medical Department, said: "Due to the improvement of living conditions, the number of sick and wounded has decreased a lot. In the past, each company had more than 80 sick and wounded. This year, each regiment has very few."
    The democratic system has been established. Military congresses and production review meetings are held regularly. Every living unit has an economic committee. All expenses must be discussed and approved by the economic committee. Each unit has a suggestion box. Sun, the head of the Special Task Regiment, said: "The suggestion box is opened every day, and there are many written suggestions every day." Commander-in-Chief Gao said: "In the past, one person managed everyone, now everyone manages one person." In particular, the soldiers were very happy to elect and establish an economic committee, because in the past they didn't know all the expenses and suffered a lot of losses.
    Their lives are full of joy. In addition to work and free activities, they have their own wall newspapers. The articles on them are all written by the soldiers, who write what they want to say. Many game tools such as bars and wooden horses are set up on the edge of the village. None of the soldiers have a sad face, they are all smiling. I asked a few young soldiers who were jumping on a wooden horse in the Second Division, "Why are you so happy?" They looked at me and said, "How can we not be happy! We don't worry about food and drink, and we don't get angry." Commander-in-Chief Gao said at the meeting: "You are all eating fat and full of red light, and you are all smiling so hard that you can't close your mouths. This is what is called high morale. I have been leading troops for decades, and I have only seen it today."
    In the process of the entire army moving forward, there are naturally some shortcomings, but the leadership has noticed these shortcomings and will definitely correct them, just as Division Commander Tian said: "We are learning now, and there will definitely be some problems, but we are not afraid, I am determined and confident that we can overcome them."
    Let this democratic team grow and strengthen in the embrace of the people day by day!

### 我见到了民主建国军

　　我见到了民主建国军
    朱波
    本月二十二日，我到达了民主建国军总部，在那里，首先给我印象最深的是到处可以听到士兵们自由民主的歌声。
    民主建国军从起义到今天已十个多月了。在官兵关系上、军民关系上，都一天比一天的进步着，特别是军民关系上，做的更好。麦收的时候，全军从总司令到杂务人员，都参加了麦收工作，连病号也参加了，他们成立小组，自带给养到外村帮助老乡麦收，据不完全的统计，仅一师在六天中，参加麦收人数八千一百五十个工，割麦一万二千余亩，一师梁副官割完麦，累的腿疼腰酸说：“‘谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦’。今后如不为人民服务，良心上也过不去呀！”他们在四区受到了四十个村的慰劳和慰问，这四十个村庄老乡携带礼物参加劳军大会。十一团帮助群众生产后，群众买了很多的肥皂、毛巾、纸烟慰劳他们，都被他们一一谢绝了。但群众过意不去，便准备请剧团演剧，一个老太婆因为部队不收她的礼物，特地找了识字的人，写了一封信给军队，这封信登在民主团结报上，信上写着：“你们真是俺的好军队，帮助我割麦连水都不喝，叫我怎么能过得去呀！”
    二师六团运输连王鸿钧同志，在河里救起了一个本村小孩，家人感激得不知如何是好。
    在农民翻身运动中，二师官兵在部队中首先清洗了混进去的地主恶霸二十多名，送交县里处理，现在二师干部又掀起了献田运动（当地干部），六团石团长已将自己田地分给群众一部，现在田师长，六团石营长，一营一连廉连长，都准备把自己多余的地分给群众。总部特务团的战士帮助村里群众搞斗争果实，该村群众斗争委员会写了一封慰问信给他们，以表谢意。一师一团一营战士胡贵廷说：“我们在大后方是帮助老财革穷人的命，现在完全翻了过来。”一团副班长对被斗争的特务说：“我住你家里，你给我说：‘还是国民党军队好’，你还瓦解我们战士开小差，你这是什么意思。”群众听到后，随即高呼“民主建国军是自己军队，……”而战士们也互应着高呼“真正成为人民公仆，先帮助群众翻身！”二军乔军长致书沙河县府说：“当此群众翻身之际，我全军尽所有的力量，帮助自己的父老彻底的翻过身来”。
    全军对解放区民主政府八路军和毛主席已生长着敬仰与热爱，二团一个战士在军人生活报上投稿歌颂毛主席这样写着：“他是领路人，他是黑夜明灯，我们永远跟他走。”另一个战士在军人生活报写着“我的好朋友，就是八路军。”
    十团二营伙夫马鸿德沙河县人，九年没有回家，这次回家后，群众分给他二亩斗争过来的青苗地，村公所负责给地种，他到团里后，别人问他：“老马家里怎么样”？老马就笑的合不住嘴说：“穷人翻身捎带着我也翻身啦。”
    一个军需上士何风银，是河北省清丰县人，这次回家后看到房子倒了，二十多亩地都荒芜了，老婆因灾荒嫁了，他找到当地民主政府，请求合理解决。现在由当地政府帮助，修盖了一座新的房舍，老婆经政府合理调解又回来了，土地村中负责给种。战士们都深深感觉到解放区的政府比大后方的政府强百倍，在那里应该发的东西还不给，那里还管你家庭问题。
    “官兵打成一片。”二团九连排长尹树森从干训团回去后，在生产上工作上都是跑到头里，战士们说：“排长进步了，我们也跟着好好的进步吧！”有好些连排官长学习后，都很积极的起模范作用来影响战士，战士们也自动争取工作。一团战士李振华除去上课放哨外，都是跑到菜园子里去种菜浇水，总部特务团孙团长说：“过去官长拿着棒子催着做一件工作，战士们还做不好，故意的给你挑皮捣蛋，毁家具坏东西，现在有了工作，都抢着去干，而且做的还非常好，这都是实行民主的好处。”
    在整个部队里官兵之间洋溢着互敬互爱的空气：官长半夜不睡觉，去查岗查铺，这些事过去是从来未有过的，一些战士提出来，“干部工作忙太累，给他们另做些菜吃。”但被干部感激的谢绝了。现在不管战士和官长除正式学习外，可以在一块说说笑笑。一团三营战士在壁报上的批评与建议栏写着：“营长同志！学习时你不学习干什么去了，是否叫老婆拉住尾巴了。”而营长在壁报上答复的是：“我因开会没有参加你们的学习，老婆不但不能拉腿，我还要进行改造哩。”像这样的事过去战士做梦也不敢想。
    现在全军生产都搞起来了，每个单位都有小菜园，有的除去自己吃还能卖一部份，民主建国学校种地将近三百亩，各单位都有合作社运输，杂货铺，总部特务团每个战士都有一千余元的积蓄，另外在一师二师、二军都有自己开掘的煤窑，生活都改善了，每天一顿面一顿米，过去盐都吃不到，现在生产的菜就吃不了。总部通讯营他们生产的好，每月能吃两次肉。军医处温处长说：“由于生活改善，病号减少多了，过去在大后方每连队有八十多个病号。而今年每团才有很少几个。”
    民主制度都建立起来了，定期开军人大会，生产检讨会。每一个生活单位都有经济委员会，一切开支都要经过经济委员会讨论通过。各单位都设有意见箱，特务团孙团长说：“意见箱每天开，每天有好些书面提的意见。”高总司令说：“过去是一个人管大家，现在是大家管一个人。”特别是选举成立经济委员会战士都非常高兴，因为过去一切开支自己都不知道，吃了好多亏。
    他们的生活充满了愉快，除去工作，自由活动，有自己出的壁报，那上面的稿子都是战士们写的自己要说的话，在村边设立好多杠子木马等游戏工具。战士们没有一个愁眉不展，都是笑眯眯的，我在二师里问几个正在跳木马的青年战士说：“你们怎么这么高兴呢？”他们看了看我，说：“怎么能不高兴呢！不愁吃喝，不受气。”高总司令在会上讲话说：“你们都是吃的胖胖的满面红光，都是笑的合不下嘴，所谓士气兴旺，我带兵几十年来，今天才算见到。”
    全军在向前进步的过程中，自然免不了还有些美中不足的缺点，但这些缺点，领导上都注意到了，一定会纠正的，正像田师长所说的：“我们现在正是学习，一定会有些毛病，但我们不怕，我有决心而且有信心一定能克服。”
    让这一支民主的队伍，在人民的怀抱里一天天的成长壮大起来吧！
