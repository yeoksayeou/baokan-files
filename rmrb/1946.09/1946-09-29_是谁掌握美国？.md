Who Controls America?

　　A 359-page government report by the Senate Small Business Committee, "Economic Concentration and World War II," states that eight financial groups actually control the United States today. Their bases are on Wall Street, and the main owners of these eight major groups are the Mellon, DuPont, and Rockefeller families, the Morgan and Kuhn banking systems, and the financial groups in Cleveland-Chicago and Boston. Two hundred of the nation's leading corporations have taken complete advantage of the war to gain absolute control over the nation's economic life. They also subsidize the election campaigns of members of Congress in an attempt to control political life. Of these 200 leading corporations, the eight major groups control 175. These 175 are interconnected through boards of directors and shareholders, and they are linked by two "supreme organizations": the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The shareholders of the 200 leading corporations number less than 75,000, only 0.06 percent of the national population. The Mellon, DuPont, and Rockefeller families alone own shares worth $14 billion. In addition to regular gatherings to discuss the consolidation and expansion of their economic power, the leaders of these companies also meet to discuss how best to combat organized labor. For example, in January of this year, during the strike crisis, representatives of companies such as General Motors and U.S. Steel held a meeting at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel to discuss countermeasures.

　　According to the report, the tentacles of monopoly extend everywhere. For example, Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation manufactures and sells 45 percent of all cheese in the United States. The four brewers Grimes, Schenk, Seagram-Distillers, and National Distillers control the American liquor and whiskey market.

　　The five department stores Dewey, Kroger, National Retail, First National handle the majority of department store transactions nationwide. The three soap companies, Procter & Gamble, Lever Brothers, and Colgate-Palmolive, supply 80 percent of the total soap market. DuPont Viscose virtually supplies all rayon stockings and underwear in the United States.

　　The report said: Although the number of American newspapers is increasing daily, the types of newspapers are decreasing. In 1909, there were 2,600 daily newspapers; today, there are only 1,740. Among these newspapers, two systems of newspapers are the most powerful: Hearst, Scripps-Howard, Patterson, McCormick, Herbert Block League, and Gannett. Their daily newspapers account for 40 percent of the total circulation of 48 million copies in the United States, and their Sunday newspapers account for half of all Sunday newspapers. There are three major news agencies in the United States: International News Service, United Press, and Associated Press. Hearst and Scripps-Howard occupy the first two news agencies. Associated Press is the largest news agency in the United States and has been found guilty of violating antitrust laws. Now Congress is seeking special legislation to ensure that it is not subject to antitrust laws. The publishers of these newspapers own 508 of the 886 radio broadcasting stations nationwide. Therefore, a small number of newspaper tycoons completely control the nation's speech and thought, and they are all linked to the National Association of Manufacturers through their publishers' associations.

　　In the magazine world, the report states: Although there are 6,500 weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, and quarterly magazines, five periodicals alone—Time, Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, American Magazine, and Hearst Magazine—use 52 percent of the 920,000 tons of paper consumed by newspapers each year.

　　Atomic energy is also an astonishing benefit enjoyed by those large companies. According to the report: The government has spent $1.3 billion on three atomic bomb plants in the past. These three factories are Union Carbide, Eastman Kodak, and DuPont. If atomic energy is converted to peacetime uses, then these companies will overwhelm all other companies that manufacture scientific products.

　　是谁掌握美国？
    战时工业协会经由参议院小企业委员会发表的“经济集中与第二次世界大战”一篇长达三百五十九页的政府报告，说明今天实际上控制美国的是八个金融集团。他们的根据地是华尔街，这八大集团的主要所有人是梅隆、杜邦、洛克菲勒各家族，摩根、库恩银行系和在克克兰芝加哥及波斯顿的金融集团。全美国有二百家头号大公司，完全利用战争而取得了对全国经济生活的绝对控制，它们还津贴国会议员的选举运动，以图控制政治生活。在这二百家头号大公司中，八大集团就控制了一百七十五家，在这一百七十五家之间，又因为董事股东而结合在一起，它们以二个“最高组织”为联系，那就是全国制造业协会与美国商会。二百家头号大公司的股东还不到七万五千人，只及全国人口的百分之零点六。梅隆、杜邦、洛克菲勒三家族就拥有价值十四万万美元的股份。这些公司的领袖们，除讨论他们经济势力的合并与扩张的经常集会之外，还开会讨论如何用最好的方法来打击有组织的劳工。如今年一月，正当罢工危机之时，通用汽车公司美国钢铁公司等公司的代表，即在华多夫爱司托里亚旅馆举行会议，讨论对付办法。
    据报告证明，独占的触角到处伸展着，例如克莱夫脱——范朋克斯乳酪公司所制造出售的乳酪，要占全美国的百分之四十五。格莱姆斯、星克、希莱奎纽尔克和纳特尔蒸溜产品这四家酿造商，就控制着美国酒和威斯忌市场。
    杜威、克洛格、美国纳特尔、第一纳特尔这五家百货公司包办了全国大部分的百货交易。勃罗克特和格姆布尔、莱费布罗、考尔盖特棕橄榄这三家肥皂公司所供售的肥皂，要占市场全部总额的百分之八十。杜邦维斯考斯可则实际上供给全美国所有的人造丝裤和内衣。
    该报告说：美国报纸虽日有增加，但报纸的种类却在减少。一九○九年有二千六百种日报，目前只有一千七百四十种。在这些报纸中，有二系报纸最有势力，即赫斯特、斯克立浦斯——霍华德、柏德逊、麦考米克、赫尔勃洛克李德、甘纳特，它们所属日报，在全美销数总额四千八百万份中要占百分之四十，所出星期日报要占全部星期日报的一半。美国有三家大通讯社，即国际新闻社、合众社和美联社。赫斯特和斯克立浦斯——霍华德即占有前二个通讯社。美联社是全美国最大的通讯社，被证明有违犯反托辣斯法之罪，现在国会却正在寻求特种立法，以求其可不受反托辣斯法的拘束。这些报纸的出版商，在全国八八六座无线电广播电台中据有五○八座，因此少数的报纸大王完全控制了全国的言论与思想，而它们则又全部经由它们的出版商协会而与全国制造业协会发生连系。
    在杂志界，据报告称：虽然有六千五百种周刊、半月刊、月刊与季刊，但单是五种定期刊物即时代、星期六晚邮报、柯里尔、美国人杂志、赫斯特杂志，就用去了每年报纸消耗量九十二万吨中的百分之五十二。
    原子能亦是那些大公司所享的惊人利益。据该报告称：政府过去在三家原子炸弹厂上化了十三万万美元，这三家工厂是联合炭化物工厂、伊斯脱曼柯达工厂、杜邦工厂，如将原子能转作平时用途，那么这些公司，更将压倒一切其他制造科学品的公司。
