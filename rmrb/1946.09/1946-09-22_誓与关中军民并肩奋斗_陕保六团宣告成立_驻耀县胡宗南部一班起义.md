Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. The officers and soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment, who revolted in mid-August, established the Shaanxi People's Self-Defense Armed Force – the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment – on the 10th of this month in Malan (under the jurisdiction of Xinzheng County). Dong Ceheng, the battalion commander, was appointed as the colonel commander of the regiment. People from all walks of life in the Guanzhong Sub-district presented banners and pennants and held rallies to celebrate. At the meeting, Niu Shushen, Deputy Political Commissar of the Command, delivered a congratulatory speech, saying: "The officers and soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the Shaanxi Security Regiment have transformed from Chiang Kai-shek's private army into the armed forces of the people of Shaanxi, with unlimited prospects for development." He also reminded everyone: "Recently, Chen Cheng secretly arrived in Xi'an to arrange for an attack on the border region. We must heighten our vigilance and resolutely defend the border region." Yang Yuting, Commissioner of the Prefectural Office, and Ma Xijiu, a representative of the masses, also successively offered warm congratulations on the establishment of the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment and expressed their infinite hope for the development of the Security 6th Regiment. Then, Regiment Commander Dong Ceheng took the stage to swear an oath of office, which read: "All officers and soldiers of the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment vow to fight alongside the military and civilians of Guanzhong to defend the border region and assist the people of Shaanxi in their peaceful and democratic movement." It is reported that Dong's unit was formed at the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan and achieved brilliant results in the battle to defend Zhongtiao Mountain, killing Japanese Brigade Staff Officer Tanaka Eiki. However, under Hu Zongnan's policy of eliminating dissidents, Regiment Commander Dong was imprisoned for nine days, and recently the 48th Division was dispatched to disarm them, so Battalion Commander Dong led the uprising.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th. The morale of Hu Zongnan's troops on the southern front of Guanzhong in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is war-weary. A platoon of ten men from the 5th Company of the 369th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade, stationed in Xiaoqiuzhen, Yao County, led by Platoon Leader Chen Zongyuan, staged an anti-civil war uprising and defected to the border region on August 23, bringing with them seven rifles and six hundred rounds of ammunition. As soon as they entered the border region, they took off their American hats and demanded to be issued Eighth Route Army uniforms. This platoon is the second platoon to come to the border region after the 9th Platoon of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the regiment revolted at the end of last month.

　　誓与关中军民并肩奋斗
    陕保六团宣告成立
    驻耀县胡宗南部一班起义
    【新华社延安十八日电】上月中旬起义之陕保六团三大队官兵，本月十日于马栏（新正县属）成立陕西人民自卫武装——陕西保安第六团。董策丞大队长任该团上校团长。关中分区各界纷纷赠送锦旗锦幛，并集会庆祝。开会时首由司令部牛树绅副政委致庆贺词略谓：“陕保三大队官兵由蒋介石的私有军队变成了陕西人民的武装，前途发展无限远大。”他并提醒大家说：“最近陈诚秘密到达西安布置对边区的进攻，我们要提高警惕性，坚决保卫边区。”专署杨玉亭专员、群众代表马锡九亦相继对陕保六团之成立热烈庆贺，并对保六团的发展寄以无限希望。继由董策丞团长登台宣誓就职，誓词为：“陕保六团全体官兵誓与关中军民并肩奋斗，保卫边区，援助陕西人民的和平、民主运动。”按董部系于抗日战争爆发时组成，曾在守卫中条山战役中击毙日旅团参谋长田中荣矶，树立了光辉战绩，但在胡宗南消灭异己的政策下，竟将董团长监禁九天，并于最近调遣四十八师去缴他们武装，董大队长乃率领起义。
    【新华社延安十八日电】陕甘宁边区关中南线胡宗南部军心厌战。驻耀县小邱镇之一二三旅三六九团五连一个班十人，在班长陈宗元率领下，于八月廿三日举行反内战起义投奔边区，并携带步枪七枝，子弹六百发。他们一进边区，便把美国的帽子撩了，并要求给他们发八路军的服装。该班系继上月底该团二营五连第九班起义来边区之第二个班。
