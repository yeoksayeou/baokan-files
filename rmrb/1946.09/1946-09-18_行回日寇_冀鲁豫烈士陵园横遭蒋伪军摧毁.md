　　Acting like Returning Japanese Bandits
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Martyrs' Cemetery Destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops
    [Our Jining News] When the reactionaries commanded the Yanzhou puppet troops and, under the cover of airplanes, harassed our Jining City, their troops advanced to Pipashan, west of Balipu—the Martyrs' Cemetery, the anti-Japanese revolutionary holy site laid by our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. They actually pushed down the boundary marker and the foundation stone of the Martyrs' Cemetery on the top of the mountain, and dug positions on the base of the cemetery. This reactionary and barbaric behavior of insulting anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, losing all conscience and lacking any national concept, is rare in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Therefore, the families of the martyrs and the people of this city hate them with all their heart and propose that the Construction Committee of the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery lodge a serious protest to the Kuomintang. Zhang Fuchen, member and director of the engineering department, based on the opinions of the masses, jointly telegraphed the whole country with the party, government, military, and civilians of this city to oppose this atrocity.

　　行回日寇
    冀鲁豫烈士陵园横遭蒋伪军摧毁
    【本报济宁讯】反动派指挥兖州伪军并以飞机掩护向我济宁市袭扰时，其部队进至八里铺西之琵琶山——我冀鲁豫边区奠定之抗日革命圣地烈士陵园，竟将山顶之界牌与烈士陵园奠基碑推倒，并在陵园基地挖掘阵地。此种侮辱抗日革命烈士、丧尽天良、毫无国家民族观念之反动野蛮行为，实为古今中外所罕闻。因此，烈士遗属与本市人民痛恨切齿，纷纷提议革命烈士陵园建委会向国民党提出严重抗议。委员兼工程处长张富忱氏根据群众意见与本市党政军民各界共同通电全国反对此种暴行。
