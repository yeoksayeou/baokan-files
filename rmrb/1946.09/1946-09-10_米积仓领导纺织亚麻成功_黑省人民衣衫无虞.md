Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 7th. The people of Heilongjiang Province, who in the past were often scantily clad, will soon have their clothing problems solved thanks to the success of flax textile production promoted by the democratic government. After the establishment of the province's flax factory in Hailun, under the leadership of provincial government committee member and textile expert Mi Jicang (formerly mistakenly reported as Song Jicang), the factory has been making daily progress. Currently, the factory has over 200 workers, two 50-horsepower engines, one flax-breaking machine, and one cotton-making machine. Through Director Mi's painstaking research, a giant cotton spinning machine has recently been self-made at a cost of 300,000 yuan, which can spin 10 yards of thread, 720 jin, per day. It is constantly being improved, and it is expected to spin fine thread of 20 to 30 yards. The factory is currently planning to manufacture 100 weaving machines. Once they are successfully installed, they will be able to weave 720 jin of thread into 72 bolts of sheeting cloth per day. It is also planned to add three large spinning machines next year, and it is estimated that by next year, the people of the province will no longer have to worry about clothing difficulties. The lives of the factory workers have also been improved. Each person can earn 900 yuan per day, which is nine times higher than under the enemy puppet regime. The factory also provides fuel and housing, and the workers are very enthusiastic about their work. Another factory in Yian County, covering an area of more than 30 qing, has also resumed production after repairs. It is currently processing the original stock of 30,000 jin of flax into thread, and plans to purchase more raw flax, which can be made into more than 100,000 jin. The democratic government is currently purchasing flax from the people at high prices to arouse farmers' interest in planting flax. Farmers in Yian have already planted 1,300 qing of flax, with a minimum yield of 2,000 jin per qing. At the same time, it is also actively encouraging and organizing rural women to spin and weave at home, with the government lending them flax and cotton. For spinning one jin of cotton, they can get half a tael of thread as remuneration, and wages are given according to quality in three grades. With the joint efforts of the government and the people, the clothing problem of the people of Heilongjiang Province can be solved smoothly.
