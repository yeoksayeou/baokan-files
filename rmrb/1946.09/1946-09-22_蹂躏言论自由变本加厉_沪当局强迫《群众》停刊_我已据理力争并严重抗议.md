Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 19th: After the Kuomintang military police illegally searched the "The Masses Weekly" office in Shanghai on the 4th and seized 52 copies of "The Masses Weekly", the Shanghai authorities forcibly ordered the publication to cease. On the 12th, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen summoned Pan Zinian, the person in charge of the publication, to the municipal government for talks, and unexpectedly told Mr. Pan that "If 'The Masses' does not register, it will be banned." Mr. Pan replied, " 'The Masses' moved to Shanghai from Chongqing for publication. It is not a newly created publication and has already applied for change of registration in accordance with the law." Wu, at a loss for words, pretended to "not know and will investigate." On the 13th, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau summoned the person in charge of the publication for talks, stating that they had received a secret order from the municipal government to "ensure that 'The Masses' cease publication," and forced the publication to sign a pledge to cease publication, which was sternly rejected. At 11:00 a.m. that day, the bureau sent two policemen to station themselves at the publication's distribution department and printing factory to prevent the printing and distribution of the publication. After arguing on the basis of reason, the two policemen withdrew. In response to the Kuomintang authorities' actions to undermine freedom of speech, in addition to "The Masses Weekly" lodging a protest with Wu Guozhen, the Nanjing delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, after receiving the publication's report on the matter on the 14th, also lodged a serious protest with the Ministry of Interior through Zhang Lisheng, the government's representative to the Political Consultative Conference.

　　蹂躏言论自由变本加厉
    沪当局强迫《群众》停刊
    我已据理力争并严重抗议
    【新华社南京十九日电】中共在沪唯一机关杂志《群众周刊》社四日横遭国民党军警非法搜查抢去《群众周刊》五十二本后，沪市当局又予强迫该刊停刊。十二日上海市长吴国桢氏约该社负责人潘梓年赴市府谈话，竟向潘氏提出“群众如不登记，将予取缔。”潘氏答以“群众乃由重庆迁沪出版，并非新创刊物，早已依法申请变更登记。”吴词穷理尽佯称“不知待查”。十三日上海市警察局又传该刊负责人谈话称：已奉市府秘令，“务使群众停刊”，强迫该刊具结停刊，当被严正拒绝。当日上午十一时，该局乃派警士二人分驻该刊发行部与印刷厂，阻止该刊印发，据理力争后，两警始行退出。对国民党当局此种摧残舆论自由行为，除群众周刊社已向吴国桢提出抗议外，南京中共代表团于十四日接获该社关于此事之报告后，也即经由政府政协代表张厉生向内政部提出严重抗议。
