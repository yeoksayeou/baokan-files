“Save the People of Anyang!”
    —A Record of Chiang's "Benevolent Rule"
    Téng Lìgōng
    The people in the Anyang occupied area have suffered from Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny and the disasters of civil war for a year. Now they are urgently and miserably crying out "Save the People of Anyang!" The following is an excerpt from the article "Save the People of Anyang" in the Anyang Folk Daily from August 4th to 15th:
    I. "The People of Anyang Can't Afford It Anymore!"
    Since Chiang Kai-shek seized Anyang in September last year, he has been plundering and extorting from the people in the Anyang occupied area in every possible way. At a reception in November to welcome Wang Youqiao, a member of the Kuomintang Henan Provincial Government, Mr. Zhang Shangde cried and said, "I hope that Committee Member Wang will handle the affairs of his hometown well before leaving. Anyang's burden has now been apportioned to 180,000 million yuan." As he spoke, he burst into tears. At that time, the grain price was 500 yuan per dou (a unit of dry measure), so an apportionment of 180,000 million yuan was really something to behold... In March this year, Inspector Guo came to inspect Anyang. At the welcome meeting, someone spoke on behalf of the people, saying that the people of Anyang really couldn't bear it anymore. Since "liberation," they had contributed 500,000 million yuan. However, neither the 180,000 million nor the 500,000 million are accurate statistics, but only rough estimates. If we divide the manpower and materials contributed by the people of Anyang after "liberation" by the current population in the possibly ruled area, it would be horrifying. According to our knowledge, from the "liberation" of Anyang to the end of June 1946, the people of Anyang contributed 27,483,577 jin of grain, at a market price of 200 yuan per jin, totaling 4,496,715,400 yuan. They contributed 23,157,232 jin of firewood, at 3.5 jin per 100 yuan, totaling 661,635,000 yuan. They contributed 3,318,108 jin of straw, calculated at 75 jin per 1,000 yuan, totaling 44,241,500 yuan. They contributed 1,535,832 jin of bran (half of each kind), at 150 yuan per jin, totaling 230,375,100 yuan. The above five items, grain, firewood, straw, fodder, and bran, total 5,433,967,000 yuan, most of which was used by the "National Army."... In addition to this, there are county-level expenses and clothing, county-level expenses and special commissioner's orders for apportionment, as well as other temporary expenses. From March to July, a total of 330,351,201 yuan was apportioned. In addition, the special commissioner ordered the apportionment of 67,250 feet of native cloth, and the county's summer clothing apportionment was 66,658 feet. At 400 yuan per foot, the total apportionment of cloth was 133,908 feet, which totals 53,563,200 yuan. The above-mentioned expenses, from March to July, are such a large amount in just five months. From September last year to March this year, the amount consumed would certainly not be lower than 130 million yuan, would it?

    II. "Sweat, Blood, and Lives Have Been Given!"
    Secondly, the people of Anyang have also made the greatest efforts in building bunkers, constructing villages, and digging ditches. It can be said that the people of Anyang have given their sweat, blood, and lives.
    Regarding the raw materials for building bunkers, such as wooden boards, wooden sticks, bricks, tiles, labor, and coolies, the numbers that can be found in the registers are as follows: (However, the number of feet of wooden boards and sticks cannot be calculated due to the uneven length.) According to the person in charge of collecting wood, the estimated value of wooden boards and sticks is 81 million yuan, and the estimated value of bricks and tiles is 20 million yuan. 280,000 coolies were sent, and each coolie was given 2,000 yuan per day, totaling 572 million yuan. The total expenditure for these three items is 673 million yuan. However, the above calculation is not accurate. Taking only the coolies, the county government's apportionment of coolies is the number of days that each department conscripted labor. Some conscripted two coolies for twenty days of work, and some conscripted 1,000 coolies for thirty days of work. Calculating it this way, we have no way to calculate it. A few days ago, the reporter went to Cuijiaqiao to inspect the flood disaster. Passing through Macun, the Bao chief said: Thirteen coolies were sent from their village in mid-April of the lunar calendar, and they have not returned home for almost three months. The village pays each of them one dou of wheat per day. Don't you think this is terrible!
    When it comes to the number of coolies sent, it is a muddled account, and it would take years to calculate it clearly. However, we can still use the achievements made by the coolies to imagine the astonishing amount of labor contributed by the people.
    Since the "liberation" of Anyang, three protective rivers have been dug, with an inner ditch of nine li, an outer ditch of about ten li, and the outermost ditch of about twenty li. There are also thirty li of railway protection ditches and about ten li of aircraft protection trenches. In other places such as Zongcun, Qilidian, Dapo, Xiaopo, Shaocun, Meiyuanzhuang, Sikongcun, Wangdu, Shilipu, Fanzhuang, Xindianji, Cuijiaqiao, Taibao, Caiyuan, etc., the total length of the ditches is about 200 li. The ditches are dug and dug again, and the villages are repaired and repaired again. Labor has no rest, and corvée has no stop...

    Speaking of building bunkers, it is indeed difficult to calculate in detail how much money it takes to build a bunker. However, in Mao Yijian, six bunkers were built. According to the village Bao chief, "16 million yuan was spent on six bunkers." Calculated in this way, the amount is indeed not small. Moreover, bunkers are divided into so-called sub-bunkers and mother-bunkers. According to a pro-people town chief, the construction cost of a mother-bunker is twice that of a sub-bunker. More than 150 sub- and mother-bunkers have been built in Anyang. Let people who care about the people calculate this cost!
    III. Statistics from a Town Office:
    How much should such a heavy burden be placed on each ordinary person? The author did not calculate it accurately, but the statistics of one village can give a glimpse:
    "Military grain: 1,328.0000 jin; Firewood: 1,324.0000 jin; Straw: 332.0000 jin; Bran: 332.0000 jin; Funds: 15,459.3200 jin; Wood and Mud Workers: 1,500 jin; Coolies: 16,6700 jin; Carts: 700."
    This statistical table of apportionment is based on the orders of the town office, and other expenses that must be paid without orders are probably not small. For example, a few days ago, the reporter talked to the township head of Hanling Township, who said, "There is really no way to deal with public affairs now. The township office has eaten 1,900 meals for guests in three months." The township head of Sibi Township said, "Our township office eats 1,200 meals for guests in a month." Like this, there are no orders and no rules, just because the old bosses who urge grain, grass, and funds must be entertained. As usual, there must be three or two teams of old bosses urging grain and grass waiting. On June 17th, the reporter went to the Guangrun Township Office and stayed there that night. When eating dinner, I saw the courtyard of the township office was noisy, as if there was a wedding or funeral. I asked the township head, "Why is it so lively today?" The township head replied, "It's always like this. There are not many guests today. Including the three of you, there are fourteen, all urging grain, grass, and coolies. Some villagers have not returned from harvesting wheat, and they are still urging them. The monthly entertainment expenses cannot be calculated... I have entertained hundreds of millions of yuan since February this year."

    IV. Forcing to Death
    From the above excerpts, it is not difficult to see how Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny is sucking the blood and sweat of the people in the Anyang occupied area, and then forcing them to death!
    The author of this article quoted the records of the Beiqiang Daily: "Xu, the Bao chief of Dahan Town, was forced to death because he did not pay the full amount. Also, Liu, the Bao chief of Xichai Village, also committed suicide by jumping into a well because he could not collect the full amount. Li, the Bao chief of Zhongaiting, planted more than 200 mu of land and harvested 80 shi of wheat, but he was required to pay 120 shi of wheat. Helpless, he committed suicide by jumping into a well. Also, a household named Li in Shijiagou harvested six dou of wheat, but the Bao chief wanted to collect seven dou. At that time, Li bargained with the Bao chief and temporarily paid three dou, but the Bao chief refused. Li became narrow-minded for a moment and tried to commit suicide by jumping into a well, but fortunately he was rescued and did not die."

　　“救救安阳老百姓”！
    ——蒋家“德政”录
    滕立公
    安阳顽占区的人民，一年来受尽了蒋介石暴政与内战的灾难，现在他们已在那里紧迫而悲惨地呼出“救救安阳老百姓”的伸诉，兹将八月四日至十五日安阳民间日报上的《救救安阳老百姓》一文摘录如下：
    一、“安阳民众负担不起了！”
    蒋介石于去年九月窃据安阳之后，就百端掠夺与敲榨安阳顽占区的人民，到十一月在一次欢迎国民党河南省政府委员王幼侨侨氏的席上，张尚德老先生哭着说：“希望王委员把家乡事情办好再走，安阳负担现在已摊派到了十八万万元。”他说着哭不成声，在当时粮价每市斗五百元，十八万万元的摊派可也就真够瞧了，……今年三月，郭监察使来视察安阳，在欢迎会上有人代替民众诉苦说，安阳民众实在担负不起了，由“光复”到现在已出到五十万万元，可是所说的十八万万，与五十万万元都不是确实统计，而不过是大约估计罢了。我们要把安阳人民在“光复”后供出的人力物力及目前可能统治区域里的人口数目，用除法除开要把人骇死了。据我们知道，安阳自去年“光复”到三十五年六月底止，安阳人民供出粮是二千七百四十八万三千五百七十七斤，每斤市价二百元，合洋四十四亿九千六百七十一万五千四百元，供出烧柴数为二千三百十五万七千二百三十二斤，每百元三斤半，合洋六亿六千一百六十三万五千元，供出谷草三百三十一万八千一百零八斤，每千元七十五斤计算，合洋四千四百二十四万一千五百元，供出麸料一百五十三万五千八百三十二斤（麸料各半），每斤一百五十元，合洋二亿三千零三十七万五千一百元，以上粮、柴、草、料、麸五项合洋五十四亿三千三百九十六万七千元，上述五项供出大部分为“国军”所用。……………除此而外，还有县级的经费及服装，县级经费及专署令摊经费以及其他的临时费用，由三月份到七月份共摊了三亿三千零三十五万一千二百零一元。此外，专署令摊土布六万七千二百五十尺，本县夏季服装摊六万六千六百五十八尺，每尺按四百元，总计摊布十三万三千九百零八尺，该合洋五千三百五十六万三千二百元。以上所说经费三月至七月计五个月即有如此大的数目，而由去年九月至今年三月计六个月，想消耗的数字亦决不能再低过一亿三千万余元吧？
    二、“把汗、把血、把命都拿出来了！”
    其次建碉筑寨挖沟，我们安阳的人民，亦尽了最大的努力，亦可以说安阳人民把汗、把血、把命都拿出来了。
    关于建碉的原料，木板、木棍、砖瓦、人力、民夫等项，据可以打到籍簿可查的数目字可得如下：（但木板木棍尺数因长短不齐无法计算）据收木料经手的人说：木板木棍估价是八千一百万元，砖瓦估价为二千万元，民夫出了二十八万，每夫日以二千元给资，该洋五亿七千二百万元，这三项的开支总计洋六亿七千三百万元，但上面的计算是不确实的，只以民夫一项来说，县政府摊夫是各部分征工的日数，有的征了二民夫做工二十天，有的征夫一千名，做工三十天，这样计算起来，我们就没法计算了。记者前些日到崔家桥去察看水灾，道经马村，保长说：他们村中在阴历四月中旬出夫十三名，现在已经快三个月了，还没有回家，每日村中给工资小麦一斗，我们看厉害不厉害呢！
    谈到了出民夫的数目，这是一笔糊涂帐，要想算清颇费年代，不过我们还可以拿民夫做出来的成绩去推想民众供出劳役力的惊人。
    我们安阳由“光复”到现在，挖了护成河三道，内沟长九里，外沟长约十里，最外沟长约二十余里，护铁路沟三十余里，护飞机壕沟约十余里，其他宗村、七里店、大坡、小坡、邵村、梅元庄、司空村、王度、十里铺、范庄、辛店集、崔家桥、太保、菜园等等地方，沟长之总计约在二百余里，沟是挖而再挖，寨是修而复修，劳无休息，役没停止。…………
    再说到建筑碉堡一事，建筑一个碉堡，确确实实要开支几许钞票，暂时难能详细计算，但在毛仪涧筑碉六个，据该村保长说：“六个碉堡花了一千六百万元。”照这样计算，数目亦着实不小，何况碉堡又有所谓子碉母碉之分呢，母碉的建筑费，据一位亲民的镇长说：要二倍于子碉，我们安阳是建筑了子母碉一百五十余个，这个花费数目让关心民膜的人们自己去计算吧！
    三、一个镇公所的统计：
    这样沉重的负担，轮到每个老百姓身上该是多少，作者没有精确计算，但有一个村的统计，是可以概见一斑的：
    “军粮一三二八·○○○○斤；木柴一三二四、○○○○斤；谷草三三二、○○○○斤；麸料三三二、○○○○斤；款项一、五四五九、三二○○斤；木泥工一、五○○○斤；民夫一六、六七○○斤；架车七○○辆。”
    这个摊派的统计表是镇公所有条有据奉命令照摊，其他没有命令而必须得开支的，较有可靠可证的数目恐怕亦不少，比如前些时记者给韩陵乡乡长谈话，他说：“现在的公事真没办法了，乡公所三个月客饭吃了一千九百个。”四壁乡乡长说：“我们乡乡公所一个月吃了一千二百个客饭。”像这样的既没命令又无条据，只因催粮草、催款项、催民夫的老总们就得招待，照常地要有三班两班的催粮草的老总们聚集等着。记者曾于六月十七日到广润乡公所，当天晚了就留宿在那里，吃晚饭的时候，看乡公所的院子里扰扰嚷嚷，好像闹什么婚丧事似的，就问乡长，“今天为啥这样热闹？”乡长回答说：“时常这样，今天客还不多，连你们三位，十四个，都是催粮草催民夫的，有几个村庄民夫割麦没回来，现在还来催，每月招待费算不清………今年二月我到这里招待几百万元了。”
    四、逼命
    从以上的摘引中，不难看出蒋家暴政是在怎样的吮吸安阳顽占区老百姓的血汗，接着就是逼命了！
    此文作者引证北强报的记载：“大寒镇许保长，因缴款不齐，被迫毙命，又西柴村刘保长亦因催不齐款，投井殒命，中艾亭李保长家种地二百余亩收麦八十石，保要讨麦款一百二十石，被迫无奈，投井身毙。又施家沟户民李姓，收麦六斗，保长要讨麦七斗，当时李某与保长好商量，暂交与三斗，保长不肯，李某一时心狭投井寻死，幸被得救，未死。”
