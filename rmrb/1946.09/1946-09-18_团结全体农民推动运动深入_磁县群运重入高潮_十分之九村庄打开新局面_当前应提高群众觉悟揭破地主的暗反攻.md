　　Unite All Peasants to Deepen the Movement
    Cixian County Mass Movement Enters New Climax
    Nine-Tenths of Villages Open Up New Situations
    Currently, We Should Raise Mass Awareness and Expose Landlords' Covert Counter-Offensives

    [Report from this newspaper] Cixian County United Office reports: Under the call of the District Party Committee to "further satisfy the masses' land demands and realize land to the tiller," the broad masses in this county launched a rapid and fierce liquidation movement in August. By the beginning of this month, 92% of the 343 villages in the county had initiated struggles. The number of participating masses generally reached over 75% in each village. The broad middle peasants responded to the call for "unity between middle and poor peasants," actively participating in venting grievances and settling accounts for burdens, debts, and labor exploitation. The fruits of the struggle were appropriately distributed to the middle peasants, further promoting the unity between poor and middle peasants. The liquidation movement in Beikaihe was combined with the masses' demand to oppose special agents. In a meeting of 300 people, over 200 people vented their grievances. The previously backward masses all questioned and struggled against the special agents. During the struggle in ×× village, those who had been deceived by special agents also began to vent their grievances and automatically captured the escaped special agents. In the border village of Balipu, liquidation was carried out in conjunction with "avenging the blood feud of the 17th year of the Republic of China" (this village suffered a bloody massacre by reactionary landlords after the Great Revolution). The entire village was enraged. Even the landlords' seven gunmen remembered the injustice of their own relatives being killed and joined the peasants' ranks to struggle against the landlords. In many villages, they re-vented the grievances that had not been fully vented before, and re-settled the accounts that had not been thoroughly settled. Stubborn elements who attempted to deny or delay, and were unwilling to compensate the masses, finally took out their hidden materials, land, and real estate to compensate the masses due to the concerted and resolute demands of the masses. The mass movement, which had once declined in the summer, has now re-entered a climax.

    At the beginning of launching this liquidation movement, the county party committee, in addition to holding a mobilization meeting for county and district cadres, also convened meetings of village cadres, activists, and party member activists, including 2,693 people, in different parts of the county to thoroughly review the achievements and shortcomings of the past turn-over movement. In the widespread anti-traitor, liquidation, rent reduction, and interest increase movement in the first half of the year, the masses were greatly mobilized, and some villages initially realized land to the tiller. However, due to the leadership's reluctance to let go completely, the masses' economic demands were once regarded as economism, fearing excesses, and were afraid to firmly support them, resulting in the interruption of the vigorous movement. The struggles in many villages were not thorough, the masses did not turn over, and the problems of substitution and monopolization by village cadres and administrative orders occurred quite commonly, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, and landlords and despots took the opportunity to counter-attack. At the same time, due to the lack of a clear policy of uniting the majority, the poor peasants and cadres in many villages became detached from the broad middle peasants and became isolated. Before this movement, in addition to the leadership conducting a thorough review and expressing their determination to firmly support the masses' demands and boldly let go, they also organized village cadres to thoroughly reflect on their own work styles, their relationship with the masses, and the extent of the masses' turn-over. Many village cadres deeply felt that their bad work styles had caused great adverse consequences, and were determined to go back to the masses to admit their mistakes and actively lead the masses to thoroughly turn over. Some who had serious tendencies to detach themselves from the masses and were very rigid, the leadership adopted the method of temporary training to prevent them from hindering the movement. Secondly, according to the different situations of various villages, different entry methods were proposed: backward villages should start from venting grievances and tracing the roots of poverty, while general villages must combine anti-"counter-attacks" and anti-special agents to launch liquidation. The general slogans were "satisfy the masses' land demands and ensure that every family has land to cultivate"; "completely eliminate feudal exploitation, eradicate special agent sabotage and landlord counter-attack activities"; and to the middle peasants, "middle peasants also started from suffering, unite with the poor peasants to fight landlords and special agents, and turn over together." In the Pinghan Road east area, close to Linzhang and Anyang, turn-over propaganda teams were organized to conduct political offensives against rumors of regime change, and encourage the masses to rise up and struggle; and based on the special history of the area after the Great Revolution, which had suffered bloody massacres by reactionary forces, the slogan "avenge the historical blood feud for the revolutionary martyrs of the masses" was put forward. These slogans were deeply integrated with the masses' demands and exerted an irresistible great power. Many villages started struggling after only three to five days of preparation, and were more violent than the past movements, involving more masses. The current problems are that some of the masses are not sufficiently aware and hold the idea of "following the crowd," and that the political attacks on landlords and despots are not thorough enough, so there are still covert counter-attack and sabotage activities.

### 团结全体农民推动运动深入  磁县群运重入高潮  十分之九村庄打开新局面  当前应提高群众觉悟揭破地主的暗反攻

　　团结全体农民推动运动深入
    磁县群运重入高潮
    十分之九村庄打开新局面
    当前应提高群众觉悟揭破地主的暗反攻
    【本报讯】磁县联合办公室报导：本报广大群众在区党委“进一步满足群众土地要求，实现耕者有其田”的号召下，于八月份掀起迅速猛烈的清算运动。迄本月初在全县三四三村中，已有百分之九十二展开斗争。参加群众一般村均在百分之七十五以上。广大中农响应“中贫农团结”的号召，积极参加诉苦和清算负担账与劳役剥削账，斗争果实亦适当分与中农，更促进了贫中农的团结。北开河清算运动结合群众反特务要求，三百人的大会中就有二百来人诉苦，从前的落后群众都向特务展开质问与斗争。××村斗争时，受特务欺骗的上当分子也展开诉苦，自动把逃走的特务捉了回来。边沿村八里铺，结合“报民国十七年的血仇”进行清算（该村在大革命后曾遭反动地主血腥屠杀），全村激愤连地主的七个黑枪手也想起自己亲人被杀的冤苦，转入农民阵营向地主斗争起来。许多村庄，重诉从前没诉透的苦，重算以前没算彻底的账。企图抵赖拖延，不肯赔偿群众的顽固分子，因群众成群结队坚决催讨，终于拿出所藏物资与土地房产赔偿了群众。夏季曾经一度消沉的群众运动，至此乃重新转入高潮。
    该县县委在发动此次清算运动之初，除召开县区干部动员大会外，并在全县分头召开了包括二六九三人的村干部、积极分子会议及党员活动分子会议，彻底检查过去翻身运动的成绩与缺点。该县在前半年普遍的反奸清算减租增资运动中，群众有很大发动，部分村庄初步实现了耕者有其田。但因领导上不敢彻底放手，曾经把群众经济要求看作经济主义，怕过火，不敢坚决支持，致使蓬勃的运动一度陷于中断。许多村庄斗争不彻底，群众没翻身，村干部中相当普遍的发生代替包办、行政命令等问题，群众不满、地主恶霸乘机反攻。同时由于缺乏团结多数的明确方针，许多村庄的贫雇农与干部脱离广大中农，陷于孤立，这次运动前，除由领导上做了彻底检讨，表明坚决支持群众要求与大胆放手的决心外，并组织村干部彻底反省自己作风、与群众的关系和群众翻身程度。许多村干部均痛感自己不良的作风已造成很大恶果，决心回去向群众承认错误，并积极领导群众彻底翻身。有一些严重脱离群众的错误倾向又很凝固的，领导上采取暂时调训的办法，使其不能妨碍运动。其次，根据各种村庄不同情况，分别提出不同的入手法：落后村要从诉苦、追穷根等开始，一般村则须结合反“反攻”，反特务展开清算。总的口号则是“满足群众土地要求，做到家家有地种”；“彻底扫除封建剥削、肃清特务破坏与地主反攻活动”；向中农提出：“中农也是受苦起家，要和贫农团结起来斗争地主特务，一块翻身。”在接近临漳、安阳的平汉路东一带，则组织翻身宣传队，进行反变天谣言的政治攻势，鼓舞群众起来斗争；并根据该地区大革命后曾遭受反动势力血腥屠杀的特殊历史，提出“为革命的群众先烈报历史血仇。”这些口号，都深刻地与群众要求结合起来，发挥了不可抗拒的伟大力量。许多村庄，都只经过三五天的酝酿就斗争起来，并较过去运动更为猛烈，卷入的群众更多。目前存在的问题，一个是尚有一部分群众觉悟不够，抱有“跟着跑”的思想，一个是地主恶霸们在政治上打击的不彻底，所以还在暗地有反攻破坏活动。
