Exposing the Wolf's New Excuses
　　Zeng Yanxiu
　　Following the Anping Incident and Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, twice issued extremely absurd statements on the 3rd of this month, putting forward two new "missions" for the U.S. military in China, namely, so-called "promoting peace and stability in China" and "assisting China in building a navy."
　　As everyone knows, the U.S. authorities, aware of the unreasonableness of the U.S. military landing in large numbers in China a month and a half after the Japanese surrender, have for the past ten months clung to the single "mission" of the U.S. military in China, that is, to help China repatriate Japanese prisoners of war and leave as soon as they are done. Now that the U.S. authorities are creating new complications and trying to have the U.S. military stationed in China for a long time, it is not without significance for us to take stock of the U.S. promises in this regard over the past ten months. Three weeks after the U.S. military landed, on October 23rd, Stratemeyer, Acting Commander of the U.S. Military in China, announced in Shanghai for the first time: "If the U.S. military in China can disarm all Japanese troops in China, they will all withdraw by December 25th (1945)." On October 31st, Byrnes said at a press conference in Washington: "The U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in China to fulfill the U.S. military's obligation to assist Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in accepting the surrender of Japan and disarming the Japanese army." On November 1st, General Wedemeyer, Commander of the U.S. Military in China, declared in Hawaii: "The mission of the U.S. military in China is to help China repatriate four million (?) Japanese, including two million Japanese troops in the Chinese theater of war, ... at that time, the main force of the U.S. military in China can withdraw." On November 7th, Byrnes again stated at a press conference: "The U.S. Marine Corps's dispatch to North China is to help Chairman Chiang Kai-shek implement the responsibility of accepting surrender and repatriating Japanese troops. At the same time, Wedemeyer made the same statement at a reception for reporters in Peiping: "The U.S. military has a clear mission, that is, ... to assist in the concentration, disarmament, and repatriation of four million (?) Japanese troops in the China area." "Once the mission is completed, they will leave." On November 8th, Wedemeyer again stated in Shanghai: "The U.S. military will not remain in North China for any longer than the time required to disarm the Japanese army." Subsequently, Wedemeyer made the same statement in Chongqing. On November 15th, U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson stated: "The current military problem in China related to the United States is to complete the surrender, disarmament, and withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Chinese theater of war." On November 19th, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal's representative Muzzy, after inspecting the U.S. military in Qingdao, reiterated that the main task of the U.S. military in China was to disarm the Japanese army and supervise the repatriation of Japanese troops to their country. On November 21st and 22nd, Byrnes repeatedly stated in Washington: "The Marine Corps will remain in China until the terms of the Japanese surrender are fulfilled." On December 12th, President Truman stated in Washington: "The U.S. Marine Corps will remain in China until the terms of the Japanese surrender are fulfilled." On December 13th, Byrnes stated in the U.S. Senate in response to Hurley's attack on the State Department: "I have stated very clearly that the only mission of our troops remaining in China is to assist the surrender of the Japanese troops to the National Government troops in accordance with the orders of the Allied Supreme Commander." Even more famous was Truman's policy statement on China on December 15th: "The United States has been helping and will continue to help the National Government of the Republic of China in the liberated areas to disarm and repatriate Japanese troops, and the U.S. Marine Corps is stationed in North China for this purpose." An even more authoritative statement was the agreement of the U.S., Soviet, and British foreign ministers in Moscow on December 27th. In that agreement, Byrnes, representing the U.S. government, solemnly declared that as soon as the Japanese troops had been withdrawn, the U.S. military would withdraw from China. On January 13th of this year, Lieutenant General Rockey, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, again stated in Tianjin: In order to complete the mission of withdrawing Japanese troops, "all U.S. Marine Corps can withdraw before March 1st." On May 8th of this year, in a statement commemorating the victory in Europe, Rockey again explained that the mission of the U.S. military was to "assist in the disarmament and repatriation of Japanese troops." On June 25th, the U.S. State Department, in response to Comrade Mao Zedong's statement on June 22nd, stated even more clearly: "The mission of the U.S. military in China is to repatriate Japanese troops in China at the request of the Chinese government. The only purpose of the U.S. military in China is this." On July 23rd, the U.S. State Department, in response to Mr. Song Qingling's statement on July 22nd, reiterated that the mission of the U.S. military in China was to "assist China in completing the withdrawal of Japanese troops from its territory." However, all these hundreds of solemn statements by presidents, foreign ministers, secretaries of the army, secretaries of the navy, commanders-in-chief, generals, and lieutenant generals were so worthless that a statement by Cooke, creating new complications, threw them into the toilet! We cannot help but wonder how there can be such a government in the world that disregards its credibility and national character.
　　Secondly, we are even more amazed at how Cooke and his ilk can utter the lie that the U.S. military stationed in China can "promote peace in China." People have ample reason to suspect that the words "promote peace" here were probably a mistake by the journalist who recorded the words "promote war"?! Has there ever been such a thing anywhere in the world, at any time, as sending troops, airplanes, tanks, and artillery into another sovereign country that was originally peaceful to help one part of the people fight another part of the people to "promote peace"? When the U.S. military had not yet landed in North China at the end of September last year, there was no civil war there, only domestic peace; but as soon as the U.S. military landed, the domestic peace there was immediately destroyed. Because the U.S. military immediately led the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops to occupy important towns such as Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, and Liushouying that had been liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and immediately dispatched naval aircraft to demonstrate at low altitude to the military and civilians in the liberated areas, all the way to helping the Kuomintang in the war. In December, the United States bombarded the peaceful villages of Lulong County in the Jidong liberated area, and in July of this year, it even armed and invaded and occupied Anping Town in our Jidong liberated area. All of these are the "peace" that the U.S. military in China has directly established in China. And when the U.S. military in China has successively transported fifteen Chiang Kai-shek armies to the front lines of the civil war in North China and Northeast China (of which three armies were airlifted, and the rest were all transported by the U.S. Navy in China), the peace there was completely destroyed, and the scale of the civil war expanded day by day and became increasingly cruel. Until today, when Cooke and his ilk have almost transported all of the Kuomintang's reserve forces, the civil war has become all-out, that is to say, the peace of the entire China has been completely destroyed by the civil war imposed on the Chinese people by American imperialists!
　　Cooke and his ilk's so-called "helping China build a navy" is even more deceptive and dangerous. The small number of navies that the United States "sent" to Chiang Kai-shek, can they be considered Chinese? What else can they do besides performing the same task as the U.S. Navy in China to kill the Chinese people? At most, they can be pirates on the sea in North China, attack civilian ships, or like the so-called eight "Linsen Fleet" that made a lot of noise for a few months, return fully loaded with contraband. Furthermore, from the perspective of China's future national defense construction, it is completely contrary to China's national interests and only suitable for the expansionist desires of American imperialism to "help" today's traitorous and obsequious regime like Chiang Kai-shek to "build a navy" under the control of the world's first naval power with ill intentions. To put it bluntly, who else can invade China from the sea after Japanese fascism has surrendered, except American imperialism? As long as the United States does not invade China, building a navy is by no means China's top priority today. But, are American imperialists going to "help" China build a navy to resist its own aggression against China? Of course not. Their only purpose is to build China's coast into a strategic base and bridgehead for the United States, so that in the next great and evil war prepared by American warmongers, China can be used as a battlefield and a place to garrison troops, and then lead its puppet emperor to drag the Chinese people into the bloody sea that they never want to go to. Such a base has already been built in Qingdao, where the sound of planes and artillery fire is deafening all day long, and several nearby areas have been designated as forbidden areas, prohibiting ordinary Chinese people from going there. Kuomintang officials can only applaud from the sidelines.
　　We would like to present the story of "The Wolf and the Lamb" from Aesop's Fables, which is familiar to people all over the world: A wolf wanted to eat a lamb, and wanted to eat it with good reason, so he first said that the lamb ate his grass, so the lamb should be eaten by him. The lamb replied: I was only born recently and have not eaten grass yet! The wolf then said that the lamb drank his water. The lamb said that until now I have only been living on my mother's milk and have not drunk a drop of water! The wolf then said: Then you muddied my water, shouldn't I eat you? The lamb replied again: I am downstream from you, how can I muddy your water? Finally, the wolf grabbed the lamb and said: No matter how right you are, I can't skip my lunch! The current Cooke and his ilk are exactly the same; first, your Japanese prisoners have not been repatriated yet, I have to stay in China! Then, your peace has not been achieved yet, I have to stay in China! Then, your navy has not been built yet, I have to stay in China! ... Of course, in the end, it will also be "I can't skip my lunch"! But we would like to warn these wolves in U.S. Navy uniforms, you can go ahead and be your wolves, but the Chinese people will never, and will never, be lambs. If you insist on grabbing them for lunch, they will rise up like the mighty lions of the eight-year War of Resistance to tear your clothes apart and break the paws you extend to grab them!

　　揭穿狼的新借口
    曾彦修
    安平事件后及本月三日美国驻华舰队总司令柯克上将两度发表极端荒谬的声明，提出了美军在华的两个新“任务”，即所谓“促进中国和平与安定”及“协助中国建立海军”。
    尽人皆知，美国当局自知在日寇投降的一个半月以后、美军在中国大部登陆之非理，于是十个月来便死咬住美军在华的唯一“任务”，只在帮助中国遣送日俘，送完即走的一点。当此美方当局又横生枝节、希图将美军长驻中国之际，我们来清算一下美国过去十个月来关于这方面的诺言，不是没有意义的。在美军登陆三周后，十月廿三日，驻华美军代理总司令斯特拉特梅耶，第一次在上海宣布：“在华美军如能解除中国所有日军的武装，他们将于十二月二十五日（一九四五年）全部撤离”。十月三十一日，贝纳斯在华盛顿记者会上又说：“美国海军陆战队派驻中国，乃为履行美军所负协助蒋委员长接受日本投降及解除日军武装之义务。”十一月一日，驻华美军总司令魏特梅耶在夏威夷宣称：“在华美军使命是帮助中国遣送四百万（？）日人其中在中国战场日军二百万回国，……那时在华美军的主力便可以撤退。”十一月七日，贝纳斯在招待记者会上又称：“美陆战队之开赴华北，是为了帮助蒋委员长实行受降与复员日军之责任。同时，魏特梅耶在北平招待记者作同样声明：“美国军队有一明确之任务，即……协助中国区四百万（？）日军之集中、解除武装及遣送归国。”“一俟任务完竣后，即将离去”。十一月八日，魏氏在上海又称：“美军除解除日军武装所需之时间外，决不留于华北。”嗣后魏氏又在重庆作同样声明。十一月十五日，美陆长柏德逊声明说：“与美国有关之目前中国军事问题，乃完成日军之投降缴械与撤离中国战区。”十一月十九日，美海军部次长海长代表木兹，在青岛视察美军后，他重申在华美军主要是解除日军武装，监督遣送日军返国。十一月二十一、二十二两日，贝纳斯在华盛顿连称：“海军陆战队将留驻中国，直到将日本军民遣送回国完毕为止。”十二月十二日，杜鲁门总统在华府称：“美国海军陆战队将仍留中国，直到日本投降条款之实现为止。”十二月十三日，贝纳斯在美国参院回答赫尔利攻击国务院时称：“我曾极为明白地宣布过，我国军队留在中国之唯一任务，即遵照盟国最高统帅的命令，帮助日本军队之投降于国民政府军队。”更著名的是十二月十五日杜鲁门对华政策的声明：“美国已在帮助并将继续帮助中华民国国民政府在光复地区中实行日军之解除武装及遣送回国，美国海军陆战队即为此目的驻扎华北”。更加权威的声明，是十二月二十七日莫斯科美苏英三外长的协议，在该协议中，贝纳斯代表美国政府以郑重声明方式声称：一俟日军撤退完毕，美军即撤离中国。今年一月十三日，美驻华陆战队司令骆基中将又在天津称：美军为了完成撤退日军的任务，“所有美陆战队可于三月一日前撤离”。今年五月八日，骆基在欧战胜利纪念日声明中，又说明美军任务是“协助缴械、遣归日本军队”。六月廿五日，美国务院在回答毛泽东同志六月廿二日的声明时，更明白地说：“在华美军之任务，系应中国政府之请求，用以遣送在华日军者。美军在华之唯一目的，即在于此。”七月二十三日，美国务院在回答七月二十二日宋庆龄先生的声明时，又重申美军驻华任务是“协助中国完成其领土上日军之撤退”。但是，所有这些总统的、外长的、陆长的、海长的、总司令的、上将的、中将的成百的庄严声明，竟是如此地一文不值，一个柯克的横生枝节的声明，就把他们抛在茅厕里了！我们不能不奇怪，世界上怎么会有如此不顾信誉、不要国格的政府。
    其次，我们更惊异于柯克之流所谓美军驻华可以“促进中国和平”的谎话如何说得出口，人们有充分理由去怀疑这里的“促进和平”二字，恐怕是新闻记者把“促进战争”两字记错了的吧？！全世界的任何地方、任何时候、几曾有过这样的把军队、飞机、坦克、大炮开进另一个本来是和平的主权国家去，帮助一部分人打另一部分人的“促进和平”呢？当去年九月底美国军队还没有在华北登陆以前，那里没有内战，只有国内和平；但当美军一登陆以后，那里的国内和平就马上被破坏了。因为美军立即率领蒋伪军占领了已为八路军解放的秦皇岛、北戴河、留守营……等重要的城镇，并立即派遣海军飞机对解放区军民低空示威，一直到为国民党助战。十二月，美国又炮轰冀东解放区卢龙县的和平乡村，今年七月更武装进犯和占领我冀东解放区的安平镇。所有这些，就是在华美军在中国直接建立起来的“和平”。而当驻华美军前后已把十五个蒋介石军先后运到华北和东北（其中除三个军是空运外，余均为美国在华海军一手包运）的内战前线以后，那里的和平就完全被破坏，内战的规模日益展开，日益残酷。直到今天，柯克之流几乎已把国民党的后备兵力全部运光了的时候，内战也就成为全面的，也就是说，全中国的和平都被美国帝国主义者所强加于中国人民身上的内战所完全破坏了！
    柯克之流的所谓“帮助中国建立海军”，更是带有极端的欺骗性和危险性的，现在美国“送”给蒋介石的少数海军，难道算是中国的吗？它们除了执行与美国驻华海军的同样残杀中国人民的任务以外，还能做什么呢？至多不过在华北海面上做做海盗，打打民船，或像锣鼓喧天地闹了几个月的所谓八艘“林森舰队”一样，满载私货而归罢了。再从中国将来的国防建设说，在不怀好意的全世界第一个海军强国支配之下，来帮助今天像蒋介石这样一个卖国媚外的政权“建立海军”，也是完全违反中国的国家利益，而仅仅适合于美国帝国主义的扩张欲望的。明白地说，能够从海上来侵略中国的，在日本法西斯已经投降以后，除了美国帝国主义还有谁呢？只要美国不来侵略中国，建设海军决不是今天中国的当务之急。但是，美国帝国主义者难道是要“帮助”中国建立海军来抵抗它自己对中国的侵略吗？当然不是，他们的唯一的目的，只在把中国沿海建成美国的战略基地和桥头堡垒，以便在美国好战分子们所准备的另一次大的罪恶战争中，把中国作为战场和屯兵场所，并进而率领着它的儿皇帝把中国人民拖入他们所决不愿去的血腥大海中。这样的基地已经在青岛建成了，那里终日机声轧轧，炮声隆隆，附近若干区域已划为禁地，禁止中国老百姓前往，国民党官员们也只有在旁鼓掌的份儿。
    我们愿意提出一个全世界人士都很熟悉的伊索寓言上“狼和小羊”的故事：一只狼想要吃一只小羊，而且要吃得很有理由，就先说小羊吃了他的草，因此小羊应当让他吃掉，小羊回答说：我才生下地不久，还没有吃过草哩！狼又说小羊喝了他的水，小羊说直到现在我还是仅仅吃母亲的奶汁过活，还没有喝过任何一滴水哩！狼又说：那么，你把我的水弄混了，不该给我吃掉吗？小羊又回答说：我在你的下流，如何能弄混你的水呢？最后狼一把把小羊抓过来说：不管你多么有理，我的午餐总不能不吃呀！现在的柯克之流正是一模一样；先是你的日俘还未遣完哩，我不能不驻在中国呀！然后是你的和平还未实现哩，我不能不驻在中国呀！然后是你的海军还没有建立起来哩，我不能不驻在中国呀！……当然最后也是“我的午餐总不能不吃”的！可是我们愿意警告这些穿着美军海军制服的狼们，你们尽管去想做你们的狼吧，中国人民却决不是也决不会做小羊的。如果你们一定要把他们抓来做午餐的时候，他们便会像抗战八年雄狮一样地起来撕破你们的衣服，打断你们伸进来攫捕他们的脚爪的！
