　　Domestic News Briefs
　　Of the more than 120 Western medicine factories in Shanghai, by the beginning of last month, over 60, including New Asia Nutrition Chemical Factory, Universe Pharmaceutical Factory, and Great China Pharmaceutical Factory, had closed down. The remaining factories have reduced their scale or are exclusively engaged in purchasing American medicines. A significant reason for the collapse of the Western medicine industry is the competition from a large influx of American goods.
　　Central News Agency reports: Since August, the total value of imported goods in Fuzhou has reached 788 million US dollars, with cotton yarn and cloth accounting for the majority, approximately 70%.
　　Following the launch of wars by Chiang's troops in eastern Hebei, Rehe, and Beiping, the price of coal in Beiping has skyrocketed from 1,800 yuan to 4,800 yuan per hundred catties in the past week. This is because the coal mountain area has become a front line, and Chiang's troops are forcibly conscripting coal miners to serve their military needs, making it impossible to transport coal.
　　According to statistics from the Beiping Municipal Government, using the 1937 cost of living index as a base, the cost of living index for civil servants in the city has reached 9,189 times that base.
　　Shanghai's democratic publication, "The Weekly," was forced to cease publication by the Kuomintang authorities in mid-August after publishing 50 issues. In the first half of August alone, bookstores in Shanghai, including Huanghe, Shenghuo, Huaxia, and Tianyi Book Companies, as well as the Shanghai Book and Newspaper Joint Distribution Office, were forcibly searched by the police.
　　Following the destruction of the Chongqing National Gazette by thugs on the 10th of last month, representatives from various newspaper offices in the city held a meeting to discuss the matter. Chen Yunge, Wang Wenbin, Gao Yuanbin, and ten other heads of the Chongqing Newspaper Association went to the Xingyuan Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the 14th Regiment of Military Police, and the Police Bureau to petition for a thorough investigation of the perpetrators.
