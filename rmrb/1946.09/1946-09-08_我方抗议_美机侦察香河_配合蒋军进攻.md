　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd: Xianghe News: At noon on the 2nd, Group 25 went to Xiji (northwest of Xianghe) to investigate. On the way, in Matou Town (southwest of Xianghe), they witnessed two U.S. reconnaissance planes circling over the Xianghe area for a long time. On the same day, they also saw frequent movements of Chiang's 142nd Division at the Yunhe Station; and they were building bridges and fortifications in Matou and Wangjiabai, preparing for an offensive towards the Xianghe-Sanhe area. The military reconnaissance by U.S. aircraft in the aforementioned areas is clearly in coordination with Chiang's troops' offensive. Therefore, the CCP representative in the group made an oral protest to the U.S. representative face-to-face, and reported it to the Executive Headquarters, demanding that the U.S. side immediately stop this illegal act by the U.S. military.
