　　Li Cheng Hero Wang Fengqi Leads the Whole Village
	Expected to Achieve "Cultivate Two, Surplus One" This Year
	[This newspaper, Li Cheng News] Under the leadership and promotion of Wang Fengqi, a first-class labor hero in the county, Xia Zhuang Village in the first district has made rapid progress in production, with production results exceeding any previous year. He led the masses to deeply understand from their own experience that "organizing," intensive cultivation, improved technology, promotion of superior varieties, and the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations are powerful guarantees for achieving "Cultivate Three, Surplus One." Currently, the village has a total of 209 households, with 183 households participating in mutual aid teams (which have developed from 16 teams to 25 teams). A total of 657 people are organized, and the village has increased arable land by 382 mu. Wang Fengqi's mutual aid team has been helping each other for three consecutive years, and every household is prospering and is very motivated. Some people said: "It is good to be organized, everyone gets rich, the poor and the rich benefit, and everyone can have a good time." An old man said: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, if it weren't for being organized, could we buy land and build houses? Chairman Mao is right to organize everyone to get rich." During the busy period of summer harvesting and weeding, Wang Fengqi led everyone to calculate accurately, so that labor and semi-labor were appropriately distributed, and the summer harvesting and weeding work was completed in just over ten days. In the weeding campaign, challenge competitions were launched to improve everyone's enthusiasm. Now the millet and corn have been weeded twice; the cotton has been weeded three times, and it is planned to weed it again. Wang Fengqi's team averaged 1.6 shi of grain per mu before 1944. After being organized in 1944, the average grain yield per mu was 2 shi, and the average yield per mu in the village increased by 3 dou. The village has a total of 3,740.08 mu of land, and the total increase in fine grain over two years is 14,960 shi. Currently, seven households in the village have risen from tenant farmers to poor peasants; fifteen households have risen from poor peasants to middle peasants; six households have risen from middle peasants to wealthy middle peasants; and eight households have risen from wealthy middle peasants to rich peasants (only natural villages, excluding attached villages). Under Wang Fengqi's efforts, Xia Zhuang has also become a model village for promoting superior varieties. Last year, Xia Zhuang's Golden Queen district and 169 wheat district were both promoted by him. His Golden Queen corn can produce two big shi per mu, and the village averages 1.2 shi per mu. The village has planted 452.6 mu of cotton this year (four times more than last year), and it is estimated that each mu can produce 30 jin of cotton. Calculating one jin of cotton for one big dou of rice, the total is equivalent to 2,715.2 shi of fine grain (one mu of cotton can top the harvest of five mu of grain). Under the organization and promotion of Wang Fengqi, agricultural and sideline occupations are also well combined. He can organize the surplus labor force in each period to transport goods for small cooperatives and correctly implement the 20/80 profit sharing. Since spring, the village's sideline production has earned a total of 485,800 yuan. A small textile factory has also been organized to improve technology. Currently, the village has 25 mutual aid teams, four textile teams, a small textile factory, a large cooperative, and five small cooperatives, which have gradually put the countryside on the road to self-sufficiency in food and clothing.
	The original plan was to increase the yield of fine grain by one small dou per mu this year. According to this year's production results and crop estimates, the yield can be increased by four small dou per mu. In this way, the whole village has achieved "Cultivate Two, Surplus One." Wang Fengqi is now calling on everyone to strive to achieve "Cultivate One, Surplus One." He said: "We must work hard to get rich and truly make the rich even richer."

　　黎城英雄王逢奇领导全村
    今年可望耕二余一
    【本报黎城讯】一区霞庄村在全县一等劳动英雄王逢奇的领导与推动下，生产工作突飞猛进，生产成绩超过已往任何一年。他领导群众从自己经验中深刻认识“组织起来”、深耕细作、技术提高、推广优良品种、农副业结合，是达到耕三余一的有力保证。现全村共二百零九户，参加互助组的有一百八十三户（已由十六个组发展到二十五个组），组织起来的有六百五十七人，全村共增加耕地三百八十二亩。王逢奇互助组一连互助了三年，户户发家，劲头很大。有人说：“组织起来就是好，大家发财，贫富沾光，人人都能过好时光。”一个老汉说：“不是共产党领导，不是组织起来，咱能买地修房盖屋？毛主席组织大家发财就是正确。”在夏收锄苗的紧张阶段，王逢奇领导大家精确计算，使劳力与半劳力适当分配，在十几天内即结束了夏收锄苗工作。在锄苗运动上，展开了挑战竞赛，提高了每个人的积极性。现在谷和玉茭已锄了两遍；棉花已锄了三遍，且准备再锄一遍。王逢奇组在四四年前每亩平均产粮一石六斗，四四年组织起来后，每亩平均产粮两石，全村每亩平均增产三斗，全村共有地三千七百四十亩零八分，两年共可增产细粮一万四千九百六十石。现全村已有七户由佃农上升贫农；十五户由贫农上升中农；六户由中农上升富裕中农；八户由富裕中农上升富农（仅是自然村，附村不在其中）。在王逢奇的努力下，霞庄又成为推广优良品种的模范村，去年霞庄的金皇后区，一六九小麦区，都是他一手推动的。他的金皇后玉茭每亩能打两大石，全村每亩平均可打一石二斗，全村今年种棉四百五十二亩六分（超过去年四倍），预计今年每亩可产花三十斤，以一斤花换一大斗米计算，共合粮二千七百一十五石二斗细粮（一亩花可顶五亩谷的收成）。农副业，在王逢奇的组织推动下也结合的很好，他能组织每一个时期的剩余劳动力，给小型合作社运输，正确地实行二八分红。自从春天到现在，全村副业生产共赚了四十八万五千八百元。且组织了纺织小型工厂，提高了技术。现全村有二十五个互助组，四个纺织队，纺织小型工厂，一个大合作社，五个小型合作社，使农村逐渐走上了衣食自给的道路。
    今年原计划每亩增产细粮一小斗，根据今年生产成绩与庄稼预计，每亩能增产四小斗。这样，全村已达到耕二余一。王逢奇现在又号召大家争取做到耕一余一，他说：“我们要努力发家致富，真正做到富者更富。”
