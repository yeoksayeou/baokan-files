Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th. In a certain wounded soldiers' hospital, there are New Fourth Army soldiers wounded in the self-defense war, as well as wounded KMT soldiers captured by the New Fourth Army. Under the attentive care of medical personnel and the warm solicitude of people from all walks of life, although they have varying degrees of injuries, they are in good spirits, and some can already walk with crutches. Weng Degao, a combat team leader of the New Fourth Army, pointed to his injured right arm and told reporters, "This was caused by an American-made machine gun bullet. Without American help, Chiang Kai-shek would not dare to fight a civil war." Whenever the United States was mentioned, Weng Degao had unforgettable memories. He said, "Back in 1944, an American plane crashed near Haimen. We risked our lives fighting the Japanese devils to rescue five American pilots and escorted them to the headquarters. Although everyone was living a hard life at the time, eating only two meals a day, the American pilots were treated with lavish meals of fish and meat. At that time, we believed that Allied friends should be treated this way. Who would have thought that we are now being attacked by American planes and cannons! I want to protest against the ungrateful American government!" Speaking of the KMT army's combat effectiveness, Xu Kesheng, a squad leader of the New Fourth Army, said humorously, "Probably because the bullets the Americans send are worthless, right? They fire a burst of machine-gun bullets or dozens of artillery shells at the slightest sound. Their so-called 'attack targets' are truly ridiculous. They are all cowards, and they kneel down and surrender as soon as they see our bayonets and grenades." They all share a common desire: to return to the front line as soon as their wounds heal. The reporter interviewed a captured soldier named Tan Fugui, who is from Dantu. He was a soldier of the 235th Regiment of the 79th Brigade (formerly a division) of the 49th Division (formerly an army) of the KMT army. He was injured in the Rugao southern battle, suffering from skin diseases all over his body, and is currently receiving treatment. He said, "We don't welcome American equipment. Because if there were no American equipment, there would be no civil war. We soldiers all want to go home and be ordinary people as soon as possible, and live a peaceful life. The officers deceive the soldiers, saying that American weapons were bought with Chinese money. I think whether they are bought or given, they are all a scourge to the people!"

　　苏皖后方医院负伤战士
    谴责美国忘恩负义
    【新华社淮阴六日电】某地伤兵医院里面有新四军在自卫战争中负伤的战士，也有被新四军俘掳的蒋军伤兵。他们在医务人员的殷勤看护与各界群众的热烈慰问下，虽然带着或重或轻的创伤，但精神都很愉快，有的已经可以扶杖行走。新四军的一位战斗组长翁德高指着他致伤的右手臂对记者说：“这就是美制机枪弹打的。蒋介石没有美国帮忙，他是不敢打内战的。”一提到美国，翁德高就有着难忘的回忆，他说：“当一九四四年的时候，一架美国飞机落在海门附近，经我们同日本鬼子拚刺刀才救出来，把五个美国机师护送到司令部。虽然当时大家生活都很苦，每天吃两顿饭，但是招待美国机师都是大鱼大肉的。那时我们认为，优待盟军朋友应该如此。谁知道现在打我们的正是美国的飞机大炮！我要向忘恩负义的美国政府提出抗议！”谈到蒋军的战斗力，新四军的一个班长许克胜幽默地说：“大概是因为美国人送的子弹不值钱吧？他们只要听到一点动静，就是一梭子机枪弹或者数十颗炮弹乱发一通。他们的所谓‘攻击目标’真是可笑的很。他们都是怕死鬼，一看见我们的刺刀和手榴弹，都就跪下来缴枪。”他们有一个共同的愿望，就是只等伤口一好重上前线。记者访问了一位俘虏兵谭富贵，他是丹徒人，是蒋军四十九师（原军）七十九旅（原师）二三五团的一个战士，在如皋南部战役中受伤的，满身皮肤病，正在治疗中。他说：“我们并不欢迎美国装备。因为要是没有美国装备，也不会打内战了。我们当士兵的都想赶快回家做老百姓，过些太平日子。官长们欺骗士兵，说美国武器是中国用钱买来的。我看不管是买的送的，反正都是老百姓的祸害！”
