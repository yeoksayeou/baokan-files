The Truth About the Kuomintang's Trial of Traitors
    Zeng Yanshou
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, all the traitors and national scum who could continue to oppose the Communist Party and the people were regarded as comrades by Chiang Kai-shek and incorporated into his henchmen. The traitors were even promoted and given official titles, acting even more tyrannically than before. Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, Sun Liangcheng, Jiang Pengfei, Dou Zhizhong, Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Ren Yuandao and other famous traitors from the north and south were all important figures in Chiang Kai-shek's "Party-State," and none of them were punished. An August 17th special dispatch from Shenyang in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao said: "After the recovery of the Northeast, not a single traitor has been dealt with (referring to the KMT-controlled areas), and there has been no response to the tip-off letters, causing public resentment." The few traitors who have been arrested are given extremely preferential treatment. According to reports, the traitors in Qingdao were served fish, meat, and exquisite side dishes, as well as first-class flour steamed buns, snow-white rice, bread, and other nutritious foods such as fruit. Qi ＠Yuan, Ye ＠Peng and others enjoyed milk powder and various American canned goods in the detention center. The so-called "the people cry while the traitors laugh" is a vivid portrayal of the Kuomintang's policy.
    However, Chiang Kai-shek's shameless policy of protecting traitors has been met with fierce opposition and condemnation from the people of the whole country and world opinion, so that Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang have gradually realized that if they do not try the traitors, it will only be detrimental to them. Therefore, in recent months, they have begun to try a small number of traitors in several major cities in the formerly occupied areas, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Beiping. Based on the materials published in newspapers over the past few months, it is sufficient to see the truth about the Kuomintang's policy of trying traitors.
    First, these materials prove that the Kuomintang's overall strategy for trying traitors is to "sacrifice a few to preserve the majority," which is why they only try a few traitors in a few cities, and reject the mass movement to punish traitors that the people of the whole country have demanded. And under the principle of "sacrificing a few," the executed traitors also contain unspeakable secrets. Among the major traitors in the Nanjing puppet regime, only Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, Lin Baisheng and others have been executed to date. These people were all long-time cronies of Wang Jingwei and were among Chiang Kai-shek's opposition within the Kuomintang, the so-called dissidents, whom Chiang Kai-shek had long wanted to eliminate. But many traitors who had connections with the "Central Unification" and "Military Unification" were preserved.
    The second is to protect the big traitors and use the small traitors and even ordinary people as scapegoats. In Suzhou, more than 200 "traitors" were arrested overnight, including bank trainees, store clerks, servants of giant traitors, middle school students, etc. The "trial result" was that a worker built a house for the Japanese, which was beneficial to the enemy and puppet regime, and he was sentenced to twelve years of "imprisonment"; also, a certain puppet tax bureau chief was originally afraid of being drafted, and should be "released." Under this policy, Wen Zongyao, the earliest initiator of the puppet regime who had served as the president of the puppet Supreme Court and the president of the Legislative Yuan, who deserved to die, and Lu Ying, the puppet Shanghai police chief who killed people without blinking an eye, were released. Ye Jiqing, the wife of Li Shiqun, a senior official of the puppet secret service headquarters who killed people like hemp, was sentenced to only five years in prison. Xiao Jin, a puppet legislator, was sentenced to only two and a half years in prison, and he repeatedly said "thank you" in court.
    Third, this trial of traitors refuses the participation and exposure of the masses, in order to protect the evil and suppress the development of national integrity. When Chen Gongbo was tried, only 200 guest passes were issued, and the people's request for a public trial throughout the country was rejected. When Li Ze, the general manager of Shanghai Economic Giant Traitor New New Company, who was exposed by the masses in a vigorous manner, was judged, he was found not guilty based on the account books forged by Li, and the evidence presented by most of the company's employees who had personally seen Li use a large number of military supplies to fund the factory was dismissed as "empty words of attack." The Kuomintang court allowed Zhang Shizhao, the notoriously traitorous lawyer of Li, to give a long speech on the traitorous theory that "there are no traitors in the occupied areas, only traitors in the rear" and "this kind of accusation is 'lower-level offenses against higher-level,' and this trend must not be encouraged," but refused to allow Sha Qianli, the voluntary lawyer on the accuser's side, to appear in court. People know that the reason why Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang are so secretive about the crimes of the traitors is because they are afraid of exposing their crimes of colluding with the enemy and puppet regime during the war.
    Fourth, they not only suppress the development of national integrity, but also directly speak for the rebels. In the trial, almost every traitor claimed to be a "patriot," and all acts of treason became "patriotic" acts. The Kuomintang court did not refute it, and the Central News Agency broadcast it as usual, and the official newspaper published it as usual, and even the court's judgment praised the "merits" of the traitors. For example, the verdict on the giant traitor Li Shengwu actually said that the defendant, when he was the Minister of Justice of the Puppet State, had asked the Puppet Central Political Committee to issue an amnesty, and our patriotic soldiers and anti-Japanese elements had benefited from it (!) When he was the Minister of Education of the Puppet State, he maintained the church schools and private schools with great effort (!) The extent to which he eulogized the traitors reached this point.
    Fifth is mutual protection among traitors. During the trial of traitors, the Kuomintang's so-called "underground workers" came out to defend the traitors, saying that so-and-so had "contact" with them, and so-and-so had "patriotic behavior." Kuomintang dignitaries such as Kong Xiangxi and Qian Dajun, who received wealth from the traitors, also wrote letters to protect them. In fact, the so-called "underground workers" are themselves traitors or serious suspected traitors, and of course they can only exonerate the traitors when they are called to testify.
    Sixth, the indictment and the reasons for the judgment in the judgment publicly promote anti-communist and traitorous ideas. As everyone knows, the crimes of the traitors are that they surrendered to the enemy and betrayed the motherland, but Chiang Kai-shek's yardstick is not like this. Although they used words like "participating in the enemy country," what they referred to - what they emphasized and explained, was the so-called "opposing the Central Government" and "betraying the Central Government." The verdict on Chen Gongbo said: "During the 32nd and 33rd years of the Republic of China, the puppet government formulated laws to clear the countryside in stages, called cleaning up the traitorous party, but in reality...". "Clearing the countryside" is another name for the enemy and puppet regime's attack on the liberated areas, and the verdict clearly shows that they still feel that the enemy and puppet regime's sweeping of the liberated areas was not cruel enough. When Wang Yintai was tried, the Central News Agency also publicized on behalf of the rebel that he "defended Pingjin and stabilized the overall situation in North China before the victory on September 3rd after the enemy surrendered, waiting for the Central Government to take over, and had made contributions to the country (!)" In the indictment against Chen Gongbo, he shamelessly promoted the traitorous idea that "in the past, Qin Hui's advocacy of peace could still preserve the independence of the Southern Song Dynasty (!), and Shi Jingtang's service to the Khitans only bribed the land of the Sixteen Prefectures of Yannan and did not lose his autonomy!!!" All this not only shows that Chiang Kai-shek and his group have no concept of a national state in their minds, but only the concept of dictatorship and private interests, but also contains a vicious conspiracy, that is, to confuse the public in propaganda, and attempt to prove that those who oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship are "traitors," while the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek is a "patriot." In addition, the open newspapers also revealed that Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang also attempted to use the trial of traitors to put the hat of "traitor" on those patriots and democrats who stayed in the occupied areas during the Anti-Japanese War, and use this to suppress the democratic movement.
    Now that we have clarified the truth about Chiang Kai-shek's trial of traitors, we must point out that for more than half a year, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang's propaganda machine has smeared the liberated areas' movement to punish traitors to the point where it can no longer be smeared. Why is this? From the analysis of this article, we can get a certain degree of answer. Because they love the traitors too much, so when we are vigorously punishing the traitors, they cry sadly. People can understand from the comparison of the trial of traitors in the liberated areas and the KMT-controlled areas that if everyone is like the Kuomintang, without the just and vigorous movement to punish traitors in the liberated areas, then what face would China have to stand in the world, and if there were no Chinese Communist Party to distinguish between loyalty and treachery and punish the rebels, to cleanse the nation of its shame and leave righteousness to China, then how would future generations write this period of Chinese history.

　　国民党审奸真相
    曾彦修
    抗战胜利后，凡能继续反共反人民的汉奸卖国贼，蒋介石就一律引为同志，罗为爪牙，汉奸们甚至加官晋爵，比从前更加作威作福。庞炳勋、孙殿英、孙良诚、姜鹏飞、斗致中、李守信、王英、任援道等南北著名汉奸，都曾为蒋介石“党国”要人，一个也没有惩办。八月十七日上海大公报的沈阳专电说：“东北光复后，汉奸们未办一人（指蒋管区），告密信迄无下文，人民怨声载道”。对已逮捕的少数汉奸，则予以极度的优待。据报载青岛的汉奸们，每人的面前都摆着鱼肉和精致的小菜，头等面粉的馒头、雪白的大米饭、面包，并有其他水果等营养品，齐逆＠元和叶逆蓬等在看守所内，享受奶粉及各种美国罐头。所谓：“人民哭汉奸笑”，就是国民党这一政策的写照。
    但是蒋介石这一寡廉鲜耻包庇卖国贼的政策，已遭受全国人民和世界舆论的激烈反对和责骂，以致蒋介石国民党也渐渐感觉如果再不审一审奸，对于他们是只有不利了。于是最近数月来，便在从前沦陷区中的若干大城市如上海、南京、苏州、北平等地，开始审判一小批的汉奸。根据数月来报纸发表的审奸材料，已足够看出国民党这一审奸政策的真相。
    第一、这些材料，证明蒋介石国民党审奸总的策略是“牺牲少数保存多数”，因此才只在少数城市中提审少数几个汉奸，而拒绝了全国人民所要求的群众惩奸运动。而在“牺牲少数”原则下，处死的汉奸也还包含了不可告人的隐私。南京伪政权中的大汉奸迄今处死的只有陈公博、褚民谊、林柏生等数人，这些人都是汪逆精卫多年的死党，在国民党内是蒋介石的反对派之一，即所谓异己，蒋介石早想加以剪除。但好多与“中统”“军统”有关系的汉奸，却被保存下来了。
    第二是袒护大汉奸，把小汉奸甚至普通老百姓拿来做替死鬼。苏州曾在一夜间捉“汉奸”二百多名中，有银行练习生、商店跑街、巨奸仆役、中学生等等，“审判结果”，某工人替日人建屋，那是有利于敌伪，判他十二年“徒刑”；再说某伪税务局长原是怕抽壮丁的，应予“释放”。在这种政策下，于是死有余辜的伪政权的最早发动者历任伪司法院长立法院长的温逆宗尧、杀人不眨眼的伪上海警察局长卢逆英被放生了。杀人如麻的伪特工总部高级人员该部部长李逆士群之妻叶吉卿，也仅判五年徒刑了。伪立法委员肖锦仅判了两年半徒刑，该逆当堂连称“谢谢”了。
    第三、这个审奸，拒绝群众参加和揭发，以便包庇奸恶压抑民族正气之发扬。审判陈逆公博时，只发两百张旁听证，人民要求在全国巡回公审被拒绝了。经群众轰轰烈烈检举出来的上海经济巨奸新新公司总经理李泽判决时，竟根据李逆伪造的账簿认为无罪，而对于该公司大多数员工提出亲眼看见该逆以大批军用物资资厂的证明，却斥为“空言攻击”。国民党的法庭允许臭名昭著的李逆辩护律师章士钊滔滔不绝的发表“沦陷区无汉奸，只有在后方才有汉奸”及“此种检举系‘下犯上’，此风断不可长”等汉奸理论，但却拒绝告发人方面的义务律师沙千里出庭。人们知道蒋介石国民党所以对汉奸的罪恶讳莫如深，是因为害怕他们在战争期间与敌伪往来勾结的罪恶暴露出来。
    第四、他们不但压抑民族正气的发扬，而且直接为叛逆张目。在审判中，几乎没有一个汉奸不自称为“爱国者”，一切卖国行为都成了“爱国”行为。国民党的法庭既不加驳斥，中央社也照样代为广播，官报则照样登载，甚至法庭的判决书也赞扬起汉奸的“功劳”来。如对巨奸李逆圣五的判决书上，竟说该被告于长伪司法行政部时，曾请伪中央政治委员会颁布赦令，我爱国志士及抗战分子不无蒙受其利（！）任伪教育部长时，对于教会学校私立学校维护甚力（！）其为卖国贼歌功颂德到了这等地步。
    第五是奸奸相卫。在审奸时，国民党的所谓“地下工作者”，纷纷出为汉奸辩护，说某某与他们有“联系”，某某有“爱国行为”。从汉奸手里发了接收财的国民党大员如孔祥熙、钱大钧等人，也多具函为彼等庇护。其实所谓“地下工作者”，本身就是汉奸或严重的汉奸嫌疑犯，叫他们来作证明，当然只有为汉奸开脱了。
    第六、是在起诉书和判决书的起诉及判决理由中，公然宣传反共、卖国的汉奸思想。尽人皆知，汉奸们的罪恶，就是他们投降敌人背叛祖国，但蒋介石的准绳却不是如此。他们虽用了“参谋敌国”这一类字样，但他们所指的——他们所强调解释的，却是所谓“反对中央”“背叛中央”。陈逆公博的判决书中说：“伪政府于民国卅二、三年间，曾制定法令分期清乡，名为肃清奸党，实则……”。“清乡”即敌伪进攻解放区的别名，判决书明白表示出他们还嫌敌伪对解放区的扫荡不够残酷。在审王逆荫泰时，中央社也代该逆宣传说，他“于敌人投降后九月三日胜利前，死守平津，稳定华北大局，以待中央接收，有功国家（！）”而在陈逆公博的起诉书中，更无耻地宣传卖国贼思想，说“昔秦桧主和犹能保存南宋之独立（！），石敬塘父事契丹，亦仅贿以燕南十六州之地并未失其自主之权！！！”凡此不仅说明蒋介石及其一群心目中没有一点民族国家观念而只有独裁私利的观念，而且包含了一个恶毒阴谋，就是要在宣传上混淆视听，妄图证明反对蒋介石卖国独裁的就是“汉奸”，而卖国独裁的蒋介石则是“爱国者”。此外公开报纸上还透露出蒋介石国民党还企图用审奸为名，把“汉奸”的帽子加在那些抗战时留在沦陷区的爱国者与民主人士，用这来压制民主运动。
    以上我们弄清了蒋介石的审奸真相，我们要指出半年多来蒋介石国民党的宣传机关，对解放区人民的惩奸运动污蔑到再不能污蔑了，这是为什么？从本文的分析就可以得到一定程度的回答。因为他们对于汉奸是太爱了，因此我们在轰轰烈烈的惩奸，他们就伤心的哭泣。人们可以从解放区和蒋管区的审奸的对比中明白，如果都像国民党这个样子，没有解放区的正义的轰轰烈烈的惩奸运动，则中国尚有何面目立国于世界，又如果没有中国共产党出来辨别忠奸惩罚叛逆，为民族涤奇羞为中华留正气，则中国的这一段历史，后人将如何写得下去。（九月十日）
