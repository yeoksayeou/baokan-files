　　Song of Suffering
    ——Record of Chiang Kai-shek's Tyranny
    Luo Hong
    In the Henan Provincial Assembly, when Senator Miao Chongxiu questioned Director Zhang, he said, "Those who smoke opium and raw opium are the township chiefs, the section chiefs and county magistrates of the county government, and also the anti-drug commissioners sent by the provincial government." Indeed, the township chiefs and county magistrates under the Kuomintang rule were just as oppressive and exploitative of the people. In a folk song in northern Henan, the people depict the township chief like this:
    "Girl, girl, grow up quickly,
    When you grow up, marry the township chief.
    Eating delicious food, wearing fine clothes,
    With guns hanging on both sides!
    Girl, girl, grow up quickly,
    When you grow up, marry the township chief.
    Riding in a car, beeping loudly,
    Riding a bicycle, wearing a cloak,
    Leather soles, clicking and clacking."
    The vast population of northern Henan, under the pressure of hunger and poverty, were on the verge of death, but the Chiang army still disregarded the people's lives and forced them to repair walls, build碉堡s, and deliver military rations every day. While delivering military rations, the people sang this sad song:
    "Going there pulling an ox cart,
    Returning, the cart pulls the ox,
    The ox died,
    The cart was sold,
    Only bringing back an ox bell."
    Under a regime of such exorbitant taxes and levies, the people did not feel any joy from the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. They sang about the victory of the Anti-Japanese War like this:
    "Who says victory is a marvel,
    Not as good as prices before,
    Henan is plagued with famine,
    Only escaping to Shanxi."
    In such disasters, when the people heard that international relief supplies were coming, everyone placed great hope on the relief supplies, but in the end, they were disappointed. They described the so-called "fair relief" like this:
    "Such distribution is fair and even,
    Saving the officials first, then the people,
    Bo Le truly knows how to recognize talent,
    Who knows Uncle is behind the scenes."
    Those lower-level public employees were also too poor to live, constantly complaining. They sang:
    "Newspapers carry special articles every day,
    Complaining about high prices,
    Public employees petitioning together,
    Better to sell fried dough sticks than study.
    Relief supplies come to relieve,
    Saving the officials, not the people."

　　痛苦的歌
    ——蒋家暴政录
    罗红
    在河南省参议会中，苗重秀参议员质问张厅长时，说：“抽老海与烟土的人是乡镇长、是县政府的科长、县长、也是省府派出的禁烟毒委员。”确实国民党统治下的乡镇长，和县长是一样作威作福欺榨人民的。在豫北的一个民歌里人民这样描绘着乡镇长：
    “妞，妞，快点长，
    长大嫁给乡镇长。
    吃香的，穿光的，
    两边跟的挂枪哩！
    妞，妞，快点长，
    长大嫁给乡镇长。
    坐汽车，嘟嘟响，
    骑洋车，披大氅，
    皮鞋底，喀喀响。”
    豫北广大的人民，在饥饿与贫穷的逼迫下已奄奄待毙了，但是蒋军依然不顾人民的死活，每天逼迫着他们修围墙筑碉堡送军粮。在送军粮中，人民唱出这样悲哀的歌曲：
    “去时拉牛车，
    回来车拉牛，
    牛死啦，
    车卖啦，
    拿个牛铃回来啦。”
    人民在这样苛捐杂税横征暴敛的政权下，对抗战胜利没有半点愉快的感觉，他们这样歌唱着抗战胜利：
    “谁云胜利是希奇，不及从前物价低，弄得河南多凶年，只有逃难到山西。”
    人民在这样的灾难中，听到国际救济物资来了，每个人都在救济的物资上寄托了很大的希望，但是最后他们失望了。他们又这样描写着所谓“公平救济”：
    “这般分配可均平，
    先救官员后救民，
    伯乐果然能识相，
    那知叔叔在幕中。”
    那些下级公教人员，也是穷着无法生活，叫苦连天。他们这样唱着：
    “报章日日载专条，
    叫苦连天物价高，
    公教人员齐请愿，
    读书不如卖油条。
    救济物资来救济，
    救了官爷不救民。”
