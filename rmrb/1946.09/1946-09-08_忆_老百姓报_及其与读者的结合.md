Xinhua News Agency: Li Furen, the former head of the "People's Newspaper" in Xi'an, who was assassinated in Xianyang but survived, published an article titled "Remembering 'The People's Newspaper' and Its Connection with Readers" in the Yan'an "Liberation Daily" on Journalist's Day (September 1st). The article introduces many experiences of how the "People's Newspaper" integrated with the masses, which is worth studying by news workers in various liberated areas. The following is a summary of the article:

　　The Newspaper is the Voice of the People
　　Politics has two magic weapons, one literary and one military. The military weapon is the gun, and the literary weapon is the pen. These two magic weapons are powerful when used alone, but even more powerful when used together. As long as they are used appropriately, they will be 100% effective and accurate. However, there is a prerequisite: they must be handed over to the people to manage.
　　The newspaper is a remarkable thing. It can educate the masses, organize the masses, and mobilize the masses. But there is also a prerequisite: the newspaper must be handed over to the people and become the people's newspaper, speaking what the people want to say.
　　The most important thing about a newspaper is to tell the truth. The truth is most likely to "move" people. Once the people are moved, is there anything that cannot be done?

　　The People's Newspaper
　　If you were to look at "The People's Newspaper" today, it might have many shortcomings. But at that time, we started from scratch and explored the path blindly. Looking back, there is only one valuable experience. This experience tells us: "To run a newspaper for the people, you must first learn from the people and walk with the people. Then you can educate the people, organize the people, and mobilize the people." You must understand the lives of the people, learn the vocabulary of the people, and firmly grasp the feelings of the people. Only then can you speak for the people and speak the language of the people.
　　The "People's Newspaper" had the characteristics of both a newspaper becoming like a magazine and a magazine becoming like a newspaper in terms of content. In order to adapt to the purchasing power and learning time of the people, we made the newspaper like a magazine, with issues coming out every seven or fifteen days, and the content being half current affairs and half essays and features. At the same time, we made the magazine like a newspaper, using various folk forms to synthesize seven days of current affairs into systematic reports that were both news and commentary, so that the people could more clearly understand their own affairs. In form, it was a newspaper, and it was single-sided, so it could be posted on the wall for everyone to see and taken into the trenches to read.
　　The first page of "The People's Newspaper" usually had four columns: the first column was the editorial, which didn't exist at first, then there were short comments, and later we organized an editorial committee to publish editorials on a regular basis. The second column was "Seven Days of Resistance." The third column was "Seven Days of Foreign Affairs." The fourth column was "Seven Days of Domestic Affairs." These four columns were reviewed and divided by the editorial meeting, and each person was assigned a column, using various folk forms to narrate and comment. For example, the "Anti-Japanese National Construction Program Tune" in the domestic affairs column was the "Duoduo Tune," which is the "Yuan Tune." These things were performed in many places, and the effect was considerable. Later, readers asked for them, so we printed them as single volumes, with two editions. For example, the "European War Song" (ten-character tune) and "World Situation Song" (seven-character tune) in the foreign affairs column were once written out separately by propaganda teams, posted in squares and elementary schools, and used as teaching materials for students, who then went back to the villages to sing them.
　　I remember that in the "Seven Days of Resistance" column, the things that the people liked to hear and talk about were: "Today's Performance on the Current Affairs Stage - Tang Shengzhi Sheds Tears Leaving Nanjing, Zhu De Guards the Taihang Mountains." That was a section of Qinqiang opera. As for the editorials, some of them had an effect. When Guangzhou fell and Hankou was in crisis, and the people of Xi'an were panicked, we used an allegory of an old Taoist from Nanshan to point out the crux of the situation. The editorial began with "Mysterious, mysterious, wonderful, wonderful, an old Taoist comes out of Nanshan Valley." As a result, it stabilized the hearts of the people near Xi'an, and some people even wrote letters asking about the whereabouts of the old Taoist. When southern Shanxi fell and the Lu salt was blockaded, the salt merchants in Xi'an hoarded goods, and the salt administration was extremely dark. The editorial was titled "We Cannot Eat Food Without Salt," pointing out that the supply of Huama salt, Xiaqing salt, and Sichuan salt was abundant, but the large amount of Lu salt that was stockpiled was controlled by the state to raise prices, watching the people eat food without salt. As a result, the Salt Bureau slightly changed the salt policy, and the residents benefited a lot. Other things like "Mr. Er Picking Up Manure" were performed in the Agricultural College and Zhouzhong School, and the "Wheat Harvesting Song" mobilized local troops and schools to help the people, all of which had the desired effect. This made us deeply realize that in the Kuomintang-controlled areas where the people were living in misery, as long as the newspaper spoke for them, they would not only regard the newspaper as a friend, but also as a benefactor.
　　The second page was divided into upper and lower columns: the upper column was a bit larger and was mostly about the lives of the people and various production technologies and the achievements of the War of Resistance. But there were two characteristics: one was that it focused on the lower classes, such as rickshaw pullers, porters, coolies, shop assistants (farmhands), servants (small shop clerks), poor peasants, handicraft workers, and workers; and the other was reader contributions. We published the call for contributions and the remuneration in the newspaper, and asked illiterate workers and peasants to speak orally and ask elementary school teachers to write for them, whether it was a letter or a manuscript, and we welcomed misspellings and rude words. So later, the manuscripts were very crowded. When fleeing "air raids," I once carried a sack of manuscripts (including distribution books and account books). Among them were the spinning song of Mrs. Chen, a wife from Nanzheng, the complaint letter of a girl from Lintong, the reading letters of Shi Dajiao from western Henan and Grandma Peng, manuscripts from wounded soldiers in the Fifth and Eighth War Injury Hospitals, letters from stretcher bearers in southern Shanxi and students from Qinghai, manuscripts from postal workers, road workers, telecommunications workers, and typesetting workers in Xi'an, manuscripts from farmers and tenants in the countryside, and the most were manuscripts from elementary school teachers... In these many manuscripts, we educated ourselves, let us know the suffering of many people, learned the language of many people, and used the people's words to speak for the people, and also educated many people.
　　The lower half (smaller half) of the second page was the "Reading Club," which was the core of the connection with the masses, which will be discussed later. What needs to be added here is that the side column of the second page once had a special column dedicated to various feature articles, such as the Shiquan Feature (Chang Fen), the Bombing of Xi'an Song (Shao Ren), the Shaanxi Lengwa Song (He Can), and the Outer Mongolia Three-Character Classic. Some of these had a special effect.

　　The Bridge of the People's Newspaper
　　How did the newspaper reach the masses? "The People's Newspaper" was born in Xi'an Normal School. As soon as it was published, the students read the newspaper run by the teachers everywhere and promoted it everywhere. The "People's Newspaper" was thus passed on to the people. Another relationship was that a large number of students of our group of newspaper publishers had become teachers and were teaching in the countryside. When they saw the newspaper we were running, it was in line with the taste of the people and elementary school students, so they subscribed to "The People's Newspaper" to use as teaching material for students and to promote it to the people. This was a student bridge and an elementary school bridge. Later, the Eighth Route Army Office asked for 200 copies every issue, and the Shaanxi Army also subscribed in large quantities, which sent the newspaper to the battlefields in western Henan, southern Shanxi, and central Hebei. This was a military bridge. Later, we placed advertisements in domestic publications and newspapers, and asked for exchanges and welcomed distribution and sales, so that "The People's Newspaper" spread to 13 provinces in China. This bridge of newspapers and publications was even bigger. The Xinjiang Culture Bookstore sold "The People's Newspaper" on consignment, with a circulation of 1,000 copies per issue, which was higher than the sales volume of any other newspaper in Xinjiang. These bridges were a relationship. This relationship started as one-sided radiation, but later became two-way communication. With the manuscripts from the army, the soldiers liked to read the newspaper. With the contributions from Xinjiang, Xinjiang could distribute it in large quantities.
　　Later, the World Student Association came to Xi'an, and we entertained them, asked them for advice, and asked them to take the Chinese "People's Newspaper" back. The same was true when the Nanyang reporters came, so we exchanged Nanyang overseas Chinese newspapers. The Guilin International Propaganda Information Office subscribed to "The People's Newspaper." This was the first time "The People's Newspaper" went by plane. Moscow selected 14 kinds of Chinese journals and newspapers and entrusted the Commercial Press to subscribe to our newspaper on its behalf. This was the first time our newspaper was flown overseas. The most important thing was the Hong Kong Esperanto publication "China Voice," which introduced the newspaper to foreign countries. A Hungarian elementary school teacher wanted to exhibit war of resistance cartoons by children from all over the world and wrote to the Chinese people many times, but no one paid attention. He finally wrote to "The People's Newspaper," and we selected war of resistance cartoons from children in national, private, provincial, county, and church-run elementary schools and sent them to him. He liked them very much. His niece saw that the Chinese children's works were good, so she gave her collection of stamps from various countries to the Chinese "People's Newspaper."

　　"Reading Club"
　　This name was proposed later. At the beginning, it was called "The People's Newspaper Reading Club." In fact, before the newspaper called for the organization of reading clubs, readers had already done so. A group of lovely elementary school students at Dongming Elementary School in Cha Zhi Town, Chang'an, collectively studied various issues of the newspaper under the leadership of their teacher, and wrote to the newspaper office to ask questions. They also called the editors of the newspaper teachers. Later, they took the newspaper to read to the people around the town, and the effect was very good. They excitedly reported to the newspaper office, and the newspaper office thought this was an interesting thing. Not wanting to let go, they discussed how to organize reading clubs, published the initial simple rules, and called on readers to organize reading clubs. In fact, readers and those around them already had the same method; naturally, "one call, ten thousand responses," and letters came from all over, forming a relatively practical set of rules, which were sent to readers to handle, teaching readers to study the newspaper in a planned way, read the newspaper carefully, and have the newspaper read to the people in an organized way. There were also work reports and reward measures. Of course, the newspapers for each reading club were given by us in accordance with the rules, and we also helped them if they had difficulties in their lives, such as introducing teachers, buying and sending stationery and books, answering questions, and entertaining them at the newspaper office. This little bit of meaning was considered a very good method by the readers of the newspaper at that time. In the course of two years, we developed 37 reading clubs that were in regular contact with us. We helped them to report many corrupt civil servants, village chiefs, county magistrates, troops, and military officers in accordance with the law, encouraged them to establish some learning methods, and published many of their life sufferings. They also showed amazing miracles in the reading club. In a certain county in southern Henan (I can only say a certain county), a wounded soldier opened a drugstore and organized a reading club. The business was more prosperous than before. Later, when more people came, he organized a branch in the teahouse, and organized a roving reading club nearby. A secretary from the county government came to reward him, which gradually gave him a leading role among the masses. He then organized a health department in the reading club, selling medicine at a reduced price to make more profit. He also actually sought benefits for the masses, organized a cooperative of the reading club, and mobilized the masses to ask the township head to organize a mediation office. Under the call of "Don't Spend Money to Sue" in the newspaper, the mediation office did do some good things. When the Japanese devils came, the people of southern Henan were extremely panicked. The members of this admirable reading club publicized the "Defend Our Homeland Song" of the newspaper to organize an armed force called the "Chopping Green Team." More than 200 people fought a victorious night battle with a team of Japanese soldiers. What a glorious and respectable story of the people! The development of this reading club, from thought to economic life, and then to political life, illustrates the role of the combination of newspapers and the masses, and also illustrates the rationality of the combination of newspapers and the masses, using the voice of the people as a bugle to awaken the people.

　　忆“老百姓报”及其与读者的结合
    李敷仁
    新华社按：在咸阳被特务暗杀未死的前西安老百姓报负责人李敷仁氏，九一记者节在延安解放日报发表题为《忆老百姓报及其与读者的结合》一文，介绍了许多老百姓报怎样与群众结合的经验，值得各解放区新闻工作者研究学习，兹将该文摘要如下：
    报纸是老百姓的喉舌
    政治有两个法宝，一文一武，武的是枪，文的是笔。这两个法宝单用有力，扭到一起双用更有力。只要用得适当，是百分之百的效力，百发百中。不过有个前提：得交给人民来管。
    报纸是个了不起的东西，它能教育群众，组织群众，发动群众；但也有一个前提，必须把报交给人民，成为人民的报纸。说老百姓心中要说的话。
    报纸最要紧的一点是讲老实话，老实话最能“感动”人，人民一动，还有办不到的事吗？
    老百姓报
    老百姓报要是拿到今天来看，或许缺点不少。但当时白手起家，黑摸道路，回想起来，只有一点可以宝贵的经验。这经验告诉我们：“要给老百姓办报，必先学习老百姓，跟老百姓走路。然后才可以教育老百姓，组织老百姓，发动老百姓。”你必先了解老百姓的生活，学会了老百姓的语汇，紧紧的抓住了老百姓的心情，你这才能替老百姓讲话，讲老百姓的话。
    老百姓报内容上有报纸杂志化、杂志报纸化的特点，为着适应老百姓的购买力及学习时间，所以我们使报纸杂志化，期限七日、十五日一出，内容是一半时事，一半杂文、专题。同时又使杂志报纸化，利用各种民间形式，把七日时事综合成有系统的报导，是消息又是述评，叫老百姓更清楚的了解他自己的世事。在形式上，它是一张报纸，而且是单面的，能贴在墙上大家看，带到战壕里拿着念。
    老百姓报第一版通常有四栏：第一栏是社论，起初还没有，后来才有短评，再后来就组织社论委员会，按期发社论。第二栏是七日抗战。第三栏七日外洋大事。第四栏七日国内大事。这四栏经编辑会议检讨、分工，弄成一人一栏，用各种民间形式，源源本本的夹述夹评。比如国内大事的“抗战建国纲领曲”，就是“＠＠调”，就是“元曲调”，这些东西在多处演出，效果很可观。后来读者纷纷要求，就印成单行本，共出了两版。比如外洋大事的“欧洲大战歌”（十言调），“世界大势歌”（七言调），曾经有宣传队把它单独写出，贴在广场、小学校，把它作为教材给学生讲，学生又回到村子唱。
    记得“七日抗战”一栏里边，老百姓喜听乐道的有：“时事大舞台今日表演——唐生智挥泪出南京、朱德把守太行山。”那就是一段秦腔。至于社论里边，也有几回生了效果。在广州失陷、汉口吃紧，西安人心恐惶的时节，我们假借南山老道的寓言，指出时局的症结。那篇社论一开头就是“玄玄玄，妙妙妙，南山凹里出老道。”结果安定了西安附近的人心，还有人写信问老道的下落。当晋南失陷，潞盐封锁的当日，西安盐商居奇，盐政黑暗已极。社论标题“我们不能吃莫（没有）盐的饭”，指出花马盐、下青盐、四川盐来路甚丰，其大量屯集的潞盐，由国家统制高抬市价，眼看着叫老百姓吃莫盐的饭。结果，盐务局也稍改盐政，居民获益不浅。其他“二先生拾粪”在农学院及周中等校出演，“收麦运动歌”发动地方部队及学校给老百姓帮忙，都发生了应有的效果。这使我们深切的了解到，在国民党统制区水深火热中的老百姓，只要报替他们说话，他们不但把报当朋友，而且把报当恩人。
    第二版分为上下两栏：上栏多一点，是反映老百姓的生活及各种生产技术、抗战的功绩，不过有两个特点：一个是偏重下层如洋车夫、脚夫、挑夫、伙计（雇农）、相公（小店员）、贫农、手艺工人、工人等生活，一个是读者来稿，我们把稿约和报酬登在报上，并要求不识字的工人农人用口讲，请小学教员代书，或是信或是稿都行，错字粗话一概欢迎，所以到后来稿件很拥挤，逃“警报”时有一次我背了一洋面口袋稿子（发行簿、账簿也在内），在那里边有过南郑媳妇陈氏的纺线歌，临潼丫头的诉苦信，豫西石大脚及彭老太太的读报信，五、八两伤兵医院的伤兵稿，晋南担架兵和青海学生的信，西安邮工、路工、电务工人、排字工人的稿件，乡下农人佃户的稿，最多的算是小学教员的稿子，………………在这许多的稿件中，教育了我们自己，使我们知道许多人民的苦情，学会了许多老百姓的语言，用老百姓的话，替老百姓说了许多话，也教育了许多老百姓。
    第二版的下半面（少半）是“阅读会”，这算是与群众联系的核心，留待下面再谈。此地需要补充的，就是二版偏旁曾经有个专栏，专载各种特写稿的，如石泉特写（常奋）、轰炸西安歌（少仁）、陕西冷娃歌（鹤参）、外蒙古三字经等。这里面有好些发生了特殊作用。
    老百姓报的桥梁
    报怎样到群众中间去的？老百姓报是在西安师范出世的，一出世学生们把先生办的报到处念，到处宣传，老百姓报就此传到老百姓手里。还有一个关系，我们这群办报的先生们，有一大批学生已当了先生，在乡村教学，一看到我们办的报，合乎老百姓和小学生的胃口，就订阅老百姓报给学生作教材，给老百姓宣传，这是个学生桥梁和一个小学桥梁。后来八路军办事处每期要二百份，陕军也大量订阅，这才把报送到豫西、晋南、河北的中部的战场中去，这是军队桥梁。后又在国内刊物报纸上登广告，并且要求交换，欢迎分销代售，使老百姓报传到中国境内十三省地方，这个报纸刊物的桥梁更大。新疆文化书店代售老百姓报，每期销行一千份，高出全国各报在新疆的售数。这几个桥梁是个关系，这关系开始是片面的辐射，后来就成了两方的交流。有了军队的稿子，军人才喜欢读报，有了新疆的来稿，新疆才可以大量分销。
    后来，世界学联到西安，我们招待他们，请教他们，请他们带中国的老百姓报回去。南洋记者来了，也是一样，因此交换南洋的华侨报纸。桂林国际宣传资料室订老百姓报，这是老百姓报首次坐飞机。莫斯科选订中国刊报十四种，托商务印书馆代订本报，这是本报航空到外洋去的第一遭。最重要的是香港“中国呼声”这个世界语刊物，把这个报介绍到外国去。匈牙利的一个小学教师要展览世界儿童的抗战漫画，给中国人来了多次信，没人理。给老百姓报最后来信，我们选择了国立、私立、省县立、教会立各小学的儿童抗战漫画寄给他，他喜欢极了。他侄女看见中国儿童作品好，就把她积下的各国邮票送给中国老百姓报。
    “读报会”
    这个名字是后来才有人提出的，开始叫“老百姓报阅读会”，其实在本报未号召组织读报会以前，就有读者这样干。长安茶旨镇的东明小学一群可爱的小学生，在先生领导之下集体研究报的各种问题，并且写信给报社要求解答问题，他们把报社的编者也称老师。后来他们把报拿去给本镇周围的老百姓读，效果很好。他们兴奋的报告给报社，报社认为这是个有意思的事情，不放过它去，就商讨组织读报会的办法，登出开始的简陋的章规，号召读者组织读报会。其实读者中及其周围早已经有了和这一样的办法；自然“登高一呼，万方皆应”，各处就纷纷写信来，汇成一个比较合乎实际的章规，发给读者来办，教读者有计划的研究本报，熟读本报，有组织的巡回宣读本报给老百姓。并有工作报告，有奖励办法，当然，每个读报会的报纸是我们按章规赠送的，他们在生活上有困难，我们还帮忙。例如介绍先生，购寄文具书刊，解答问题，来社招待等。这点小小的意思，在当时的本报读者就认为很好的办法。二年中间，我们发展了三十七处经常往来的读报会。帮忙他们依法检举了好些贪污公务员、乡保长、县长、军队、军官等，鼓动他们建立了一些学习办法，发表了他们的好些生活痛苦。他们也在读报会中表现了惊人的奇迹，在豫南某县（我只能说某县），一个伤兵开药铺，组织了读报会，生意比前兴隆。以后来人多了，又在茶馆组织分会，在附近组织巡回读报会，县政府来了一位秘书奖励他，使他渐渐的在群众中有了领导作用。他便在读报会中组织卫生处，减价卖药，多中取利。又实际给群众谋利益，组织读报会的合作社，又发动群众要求乡长组织调解处，在本报“打官司不要钱”的号召下，调解处的确也做了些好事。日本鬼子来了，豫南人民极度惊慌，这个可钦可佩的读报会中的会员们，宣传着本报的“保卫家乡歌”，来组织了一个叫做“砍青队”的武装，二百多人和一队鬼子兵打了个胜利的夜战。这是多么辉煌可敬的人民故事呢！这个读报会的发展，由思想到经济生活，再到政治生活，说明了报纸与群众结合的作用性，也可以说明报纸与群众结合的理性。用人民的喉舌，作为唤起人民的号炮。
