Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, September 5th: (Delayed) On the 1st, at 10:00 AM, the Twenty-Five Group visited General Rockey at the U.S. Marine Corps Headquarters in Tianjin. Major General Huang Yifeng, the chairman and representative of the CCP, first explained that the purpose of the group's visit to Tianjin was to ask Lieutenant General Rockey for his opinion on the Anping incident and to possibly answer some questions, so that this unfortunate incident could be resolved quickly and well. General Rockey stated that the group had already obtained sufficient materials on the incident's process, so he would not elaborate, hoping that this unfortunate incident would not happen again, and that he would actively avoid conflicts with the CCP army to maintain the friendship between the U.S. military and the CCP. In response to inquiries, he pointed out that the "Executive Headquarters'" vehicles might have been included in the patrol convoy for protection. In response to the question from the KMT representative about the possibility of Executive Headquarters vehicles carrying KMT ammunition and armed personnel, General Rockey replied, "It is possible," and said that he had learned that there were several places along the Pingjin Highway where CCP troops were active. Later, the CCP representative showed him a photo of a bunch of aircraft machine gun shell casings after the Anping incident on July 29th (the photo was taken by the group in Xianghe). General Rockey said: It could be aircraft machine gun shell casings, or it could be patrol heavy machine gun shell casings. The interview ended after about an hour. Afterwards, the CCP representative spoke with General Rockey alone for twenty minutes. The group left Tianjin and returned to Beiping at 11:45 AM.

    二十五小组访问骆基
    【新华社北平五日电】（迟到）一日上午十时廿五小组访问骆基将军于天津美陆战队司令部。主席中共代表黄逸峰少将首先说明小组来津目的为请骆基中将对安平事件发表意见及可能解答一些问题，以使此次不幸事件能迅速良好解决。骆基将军表示事件经过小组已获充分材料，故不详述，希望今后不再发生此不幸事件，并将积极避免与中共军队冲突，以保持美军与中共间的友谊。他在答复询问中指出：“行总”车辆参加巡逻队的行列可能系求保护。对蒋方代表询及行总车辆载有蒋军弹药及武装人员有无可能之问题，骆基将军答称：“或有可能”，并谓他曾获悉平津公路沿线有几处有中共军队活动。后中共代表以七月二十九日安平事件后之一束飞机机枪弹壳之照片见示（该照片为小组在香河时所摄），骆基将军说：可能是飞机枪弹壳，也可能是巡逻重机枪之弹壳。访谈约一小时完毕后，中共代表又单独与骆基将军谈话二十分钟，十一时三刻小组离津返平。
