　　Feng Yuxiang's Parting Words to Chiang Kai-shek
    A Heartfelt Plea for National Peace
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 7th: Shanghai dispatch: Before departing, Feng Yuxiang gave Shanghai newspapers a "Letter to Chairman Chiang Before Parting" of 1,500 words on August 31st, instructing them to publish it on the 1st. In the letter, he bitterly recounted several matters. Regarding peace, Feng stated: "Peace is a matter of course in the overall situation. International peace is necessary, and domestic peace is even more so. With peace, everything can be resolved, but fighting will inevitably lead to a painful and tragic end." Regarding developing industry, he said: "Society is withering, and the people's livelihood is impoverished, reaching its extreme. However, our country's resources have not yet been developed. It's like 'begging with a golden rice bowl.' To relieve the poverty of the people and the nation, we must quickly open mines, build railways, develop industry, and manage water conservancy." Regarding freedom of speech, he said: "Freedom of speech is the starting point of politics. The Chairman has also made clear pronouncements on this matter, but those responsible have not yet achieved it. Speech is still often obstructed, and books and publications are still restricted. In short, listening to unpleasant words is beneficial; blind flattery will ultimately lead to great mistakes. The people seek access to information, but those who speculate, flatter, and create rumors must be strictly watched. Furthermore, nothing is more painful than having no friends. The Chairman should associate with ten or twenty prominent figures outside the government, often engaging in discussions with them, so that his vision will naturally be renewed and not become blocked." Regarding the current situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, he said: "Discipline is deteriorating, administration is ineffective, the people's morale is declining, culture is underdeveloped, officials are deceiving the people, and the army is disturbing the people. In major cities and on main roads, military police are beating the common people, military police are fighting each other, and military police are clashing. This is a matter of life and death. Furthermore, this year 35 million people are starving, while those in power are squandering resources. In Shanghai, each banquet costs 400,000 yuan, luxury goods abound, and gambling is open. These are matters that the Chairman must carefully study in order to turn the tide."

　　冯玉祥临别赠言蒋介石
    痛陈国家和平大计
    【新华社延安七日电】沪讯：冯玉祥临行前，曾于八月卅一日以长一千五百字之“临别赠言上蒋主席书”交上海报纸，嘱于一日刊出，书中痛陈数事，关于和平方面者，冯氏称：“大局以和平为天经地义，国际要和，国内更要和，和则一切有办法，打则必有苦痛悲惨之结局。”关于开发实业，他说：“社会凋敝，民生贫困，今已达极点，而我国资源迄未开发，所谓‘拿着金饭碗讨饭’，欲济人民国家之穷，惟有快开矿，快筑铁路，快兴工业，快办水利。”关于言论自由，他说：“言论自由为政治之起点，主席亦早有明谕，然负责者尚未办到，言论仍多阻碍，书刊仍多限制，千言万语，以听不好听的话为有益，一味奉承，到头必上大当，人民求消息灵通，但揣摹逢迎造谣生事之辈，不可不严加注意。又最苦莫过于无朋友，主席当交结一二十位在野名流，常常与之东谈西说，自然耳目日新，不致壅塞。”关于国民党统治区现况，他说：“风纪败坏，行政寡效，民心萎靡，文化不发达，官吏欺民，军队扰民，通都大道有宪警打百姓，军警相殴斗，宪警相冲突，此为性命根本之事。又今年人民挨饿者达三千五百万人，而在上者挥霍无度，沪地每席四十万，奢侈品充斥，赌博公开，此为主席不可不悉心研究，以挽狂澜。”
