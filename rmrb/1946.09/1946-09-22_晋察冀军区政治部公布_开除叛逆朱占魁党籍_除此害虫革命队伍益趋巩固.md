Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th. The Headquarters and Political Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region announced that Zhu Zhankui, former commander of the 10th Sub-district of the Ji-Zhong Military Region of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, secretly fled to Tongzhou on the 6th of this month and surrendered to the reactionaries, becoming a traitor to the nation and the people. Note: This Zhu Zhankui was originally from the old army. After joining the people's anti-Japanese army, he was captured and surrendered to the enemy during the Japanese raid on the 9th Sub-district of Ji-Zhong in the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e. 1942]. In the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1943], he escaped back to our area. After a long period of education, he was still given the position of Deputy Commander of the 14th Sub-district after the counter-offensive, hoping he would repent. However, this Zhu Zhankui made no progress at all and took the opportunity to escape and betray the people again. The Headquarters and Political Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region have respectively decided to permanently expel Zhu Zhankui from the Chinese Communist Party. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries will, as usual, use this shameful traitor as a source of rumors and slanders, in fact, no traitor has ever been trusted by any people, and therefore can never harm the people's cause. Zhu Zhankui's escape only proves the infinite loyalty of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army to the people's cause, so that opportunistic and treacherous elements who are disloyal to the people have no chance to take advantage of the situation, and finally only expose their original ugly faces. Removing such a scourge from the revolutionary ranks not only does no harm, but also increases its purity, soundness, consolidation, and invincibility.

　　晋察冀军区政治部公布
    开除叛逆朱占魁党籍
    除此害虫革命队伍益趋巩固
    【新华社张家口十九日电】晋察冀军区司令部、政治部公布，晋察冀军区冀中十分区前司令员朱占魁于本月六日潜逃通州，投降反动派，成了民族与人民的叛徒。按：该朱占魁原系旧军官出身，参加人民抗日军队后，于三十一年日寇扫荡冀中九分区时即被敌俘虏自首，三十二年逃回我区，经教育多时，反攻以后仍予以十四分区副司令员之职，冀其悔改。乃该朱占魁竟毫无进步，乘间逃跑，再度叛变人民，晋察冀军区司令部与政治部已分别决定永远开除朱占魁中国共产党党籍，虽然国民党反动派照例将利用此可耻叛徒以为造谣诬蔑之资料，但事实上任何叛徒从来不受任何人民的信任，因此也从来不能伤害人民事业。朱占魁的逃跑，只是证明了共产党八路军对于人民事业的无限忠诚，使不忠于人民的投机与奸细分子无隙可乘，最后只有暴露其本来的丑恶面目，革命队伍中洗刷出去这样的害虫，不但毫无所损，而且是增加了自己的纯洁性、健全性、巩固性与不可能战胜性。
