　　We Also Have "American-Equipped Divisions" Now
    (Xinhua News Agency Special Correspondent Si Ma Long)
    On August 28th, I interviewed a general who had just returned from the Suzhong front. Before I could ask any questions, the general asked me in return: "The Kuomintang has American-equipped divisions. Do you think we have them too?" Then the general immediately answered himself: "Let me tell you, we also have American-equipped divisions now! The 26th Division (re-designated as a brigade) of Wang Tiehan's Kuomintang army originally had only four field guns, three of which were captured by us. Other cannons, machine guns, and carbines are difficult to count for the time being. The Chiang Kai-shek invading army has already had 60,000 men annihilated by us, and the weapons and ammunition they left behind have equipped several of our divisions. A battalion of the Chiang army has several machine guns, and a battalion of ours also has several machine guns. The Chiang army has several cannons, and we also have several cannons. Chiang Kai-shek thought he could defeat everything with American weapons, but he didn't expect that American weapons, once in the hands of the enemy, could also be used to resist everything." The general took a puff of his cigarette and continued with a smile: "The Suzhong area has a network of highways and waterways, which is very convenient for the invading army to advance. They wanted Rugao, so we gave up Rugao; they wanted Hai'an, so we gave up Hai'an. In short, we let them penetrate temporarily. Recently, we only started counterattacking in the Dingyan and Linzi areas, and they were thrown into a panic. Even Chiang Kai-shek's trusted henchman, the Transportation Corps, laid down their weapons in formation. Then, the battles of Fenjie Town and Jiali City suffered successive defeats. The Chiang army invading north of Yangzhou also suffered a severe blow. From the 22nd to the 27th of this month, within six days, the Chiang army's losses exceeded 22,000 men. Why did the Chiang army suffer such a terrible defeat? You can understand just by listening to what the common people say. The common people say, 'The Chiang army has ten cleans everywhere: the youth run clean away, the women slip clean away, the grain is looted clean, the clothes are stripped clean, the chickens are eaten clean, the doors and windows are torn down clean, the bamboos are cut down clean, the trees are sawed down clean, the crops are harvested clean, and the good people are killed clean.'" How can such a team not be defeated? We sit in the room and say that the Chiang army's invasion is barbaric and our self-defense is righteous. That is abstract. Just take a look at the places the Chiang army has passed through, and it will be clear. Some people may think that the Chiang army is bad to the peasants and workers, but surely they are more polite to the landlords and gentry? Actually, that's not true at all! The landlords' houses, melons, vegetables, utensils, and everything else are equally included in the Chiang army's "ten cleans." Some landlords went to the front door to greet the Chiang army, but their wives and daughters were raped by the Chiang army breaking in through the back door. Many victimized landlords fled crying to the New Fourth Army garrison, asking for protection. Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine slanders the reasonable and legal rent reduction and debt liquidation movement in the liberated areas as cruel and "inhumane." In fact, the cruel and inhumane one is Chiang Kai-shek himself and his fascist group. As for the guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Chiang army, it has already started like a raging fire. Guerrilla teams like Guo Haibo's in the Baipu area are everywhere. Their goal is very simple – to protect their hometown and protect their lives. Where there are people, there is a self-defense movement, and there is a democratic government. The equipment of the guerrillas is no longer just broadswords, wooden sticks, or a few broken rifles. No, they now have light and heavy machine guns, and even small cannons. The Chiang army is good at losing weapons, and we are good at seizing weapons. In the rear of the Chiang army, the prestige of the democratic government is extremely high. The exchange rate between the anti-Japanese currency and the legal tender in Rugao, Taixing, Jingjiang, and other places was 1 to 25 or 1 to 30 before the Chiang army's occupation, and now it has increased to 1 to 35. They firmly believe that the democratic government is their own government, will not forget them, and is truly with them through thick and thin."
    Finally, the general pointed out: "Although we have won many victories, we do not want war. As long as the Chiang army can stop its invasion and withdraw from the occupied areas, peace can be seen immediately. But if the reactionaries insist on acting recklessly, then we can only let them suffer greater and more blows under the iron fist of the self-defensive counterattack of the military and civilians in our liberated areas, until they are unable to attack!"

### 我们也有“美械师”了

　　我们也有“美械师”了
    （新华社特派记者司马龙）
    八月廿八日，记者访问了一位刚从苏中前线归来的某将军。未及发问时，某将军即反问记者：“国民党有美械师，你说我们有没有呢？”于是将军自己立即作了回答：“告诉你，我们也有了美械师了！国民党军王铁汉部的二十六师（改称旅）原只有野炮四门，其中三门被我缴获，其他大炮、机枪、卡宾步枪一时难于统计。蒋介石进犯军已有六万人被我歼灭了，他们放下的武器弹药也就装备了我们好几个师。——蒋军一营有几挺机枪，我们一个营也有几挺机枪。蒋军有几门大炮，我们也有几门大炮。蒋介石以为他有美国武器可以打倒一切，却没有想到美国武器一旦落到对方手里，也可用来抵抗一切。”某将军抽了一口烟，微笑着继续说下去：“苏中一带公路纵横，水道畅达，非常便于进犯军前进。他们要如皋，我们让出如皋，他们要海安，我们让出海安。总之，让他暂时深入。最近才从丁堰、林梓地区开始反击了一下，他们就手忙足乱，连蒋介石的亲信爪牙交通总队也整队的放下了武器。接着分界镇之役、加力市之役、相继遭到惨败。而扬州北犯蒋军，也受到严重打击。从本月廿二到二十七日六天之内，蒋军损失即在二万二千人以上。蒋军为什么败得这样惨呢？只要听一听老百姓的谈论就明白了。老百姓说：“蒋军到处有十光：青年跑光、妇女溜光、粮食抢光、衣服剥光、鸡子吃光、门窗拆光、竹子砍光、树木锯光、庄稼割光、好人杀光。”像这样的队伍，还能不败吗？我们坐在屋子里说，蒋军的进攻是野蛮的，我们的自卫是正义的，还不免有些抽象；但仅只要到蒋军经过的地方一看，那就明明白白了。大概有人以为蒋军对农民和工人坏，对地主士绅一定客气一点吧？其实大为不然！地主的房屋、瓜菜、用具及其他一切，同样地包括在蒋军的“十光”之内。有些地主前门去迎接蒋军，自己的妻子女儿却被后门闯进的蒋军所奸污。有不少被害地主哭哭啼啼地逃到新四军驻地，要求保护。蒋介石的宣传机关诬蔑解放区合理合法的减租清债运动如何残酷，如何“不仁”，其实残酷不仁者正是蒋介石自己及其法西斯一群。至于蒋军后方的游击战争，已经如火如荼地开展了。像白蒲地区郭海波那样的游击队到处都有，他们的目的很简单——保家乡、保性命。那里有人民，那里就有自卫运动，那里就有民主政权。现在的游击队装备已经不是大刀木棍或者几支烂步枪，不，他们现在还有轻重机枪，甚至有小型的炮。蒋军善于丢武器，我们就善于抢武器。蒋军的后方，民主政府的威信高极了，抗币与法币比值在如皋、泰兴、靖江等地，蒋军侵占前是一比二十五、一比三十的，现在提高到一比三十五了。他们坚信民主政府是他们自己的政府，是不会忘记他们的，是真正与他们祸福相依的生死与共的。”
    最后某将军指出：“我们虽然打了不少胜仗，但我们并不愿意战争。只要蒋军能停止进犯，并从侵占地区撤退，和平可以立见。但如反动派硬要蛮干下去，那就只有在我们解放区军民自卫反击的铁拳下面让它遭受到更大更多的打击，直到它无力进攻为止！”
