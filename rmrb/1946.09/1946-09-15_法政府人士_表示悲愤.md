Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. United Press reported: French government figures, upon learning of Byrnes' policy statement on Germany on the 6th, immediately expressed grief and indignation. "Because the statement directly conflicts with France's well-known views on the German issue. French government figures believe that Byrnes refuses France's demand that the Rhineland be separated from Germany." German left-wing newspapers also expressed dissatisfaction with Byrnes' speech. The Berlin Daily, in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, published an article on the 8th stating: Byrnes' suggestion to establish a German State Council will put Germany in a state of "complete division." The newspaper insisted that the merger of the US economic zones will split Germany into East and West.

　　法政府人士
    表示悲愤
    【新华社延安十二日电】合众社报导：法政府人士于六日获悉贝纳斯之对德政策声明后，立即表示悲愤。“缘该声明直接与众所周知之法国对德问题之意见相冲突。法政府人士认为贝氏以拒绝法国所提之尔莱茵区脱离德国之要求。”德国左翼报对贝氏演讲亦表示不满。德国苏占领区之柏林日报于八日著文称：贝纳斯关于成立德国国务会议的建议，将使德国处于“完全分裂”的状态。该报坚称美经济区域合一将使德国分裂为东西两部。
