　　Calling on Telecommunications Colleagues to Withdraw from the Civil War
    Bai Fengqiao Writes to Yao Manqun
    Lamenting Jiang and Yan's Ruin of the Country, Willing to Join Hands in Common Struggle
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] Bai Fengqiao, a telecommunications personnel of Yan's army who laid down his arms in the Shangdang Self-Defense Battle, recently wrote to Yao Manqun, a telecommunications expert who, opposing the civil war, defected from Yan's side to our side, in which he lamented the crimes of Jiang and Yan and called on colleagues to withdraw from the civil war. The original text of the letter is published as follows:
    Brother Manqun: Reading the People's Daily of August 16th, I learned that you have withdrawn from the vortex of the civil war, abandoned your post, and safely arrived in the Taiyue Liberated Area. This just and great action makes me feel infinitely excited!
    We parted in the summer of 1940 in Hancheng County, Shaanxi Province, and have not met since. How are you?
    At that time, when I went to your place (Communications Training School) to see you, you were desperately training future communications personnel for the purpose of driving out the Japanese invaders and striving for the liberation of the Chinese people. But the facts have made us very sad! Yan Xishan not only did not resolutely resist Japan, but also colluded with the enemy and puppets to massacre the people. All kinds of shameful events emerged one after another. Today, Jiang and Yan are colluding with each other to ruin the country, engaging in an unprecedented civil war against the people. For the sake of dictatorship and autocracy, they would rather take the motherland's territory, territorial waters, territorial airspace, inland rivers, mining and all other sovereign rights in exchange for the US imperialist's foreign guns and foreign cannons to directly slaughter their own compatriots.
    My brother is a patriotic soldier who cannot bear to witness this brutal behavior, resolutely jumped out of the flames of the civil war, and moved towards the glorious democratic camp. This is the glory of our telecommunications industry!
    We should call on more colleagues to follow your example and gradually withdraw from the civil war, come to the people's side, and serve peace and democracy.
    I came over last year during the Shangdang campaign. Everything is fine. I am now studying in the officers' training corps, jumped out of the quagmire, and gained a new life. I am currently learning the skills to fight for peace and democracy. In the future, in the great revolutionary cause, let us join hands and struggle together!
     Your younger brother, Bai Fengqiao

　　号召电讯同业退出内战
    白凤翘致函姚满群
    痛陈蒋阎祸国愿携手共同奋斗
    【本报长治讯】上党自卫战役中阎军放下武器之电讯人员白凤翘，顷致函因反对内战由阎方奔赴我方之电讯专家姚满群氏，当中痛陈蒋阎罪恶并号召同业，退出内战，兹将该信原文发表如下：
    满群兄：读到八月十六日人民日报，知你已退出内战漩涡，弃职出走，安抵太岳解放区，此种正义的伟大行动，使我感到无限兴奋！
    我们是一九四○年夏天，在陕西省韩城县别后，从未再晤，想你好吧？
    彼时我去你处（通信训练学校）看你们时，你正在拚命训练未来的通信人员，为的是驱除日寇，争取中国人民的解放。但事实却使我们十分痛心！阎锡山不但不坚决抗战，反而勾结敌伪屠杀人民，种种耻事，层出不穷。今日蒋阎交相祸国，狼狈为奸，向人民发动了空前未有的大内战。为了独裁专制，宁愿拿上祖国的领土、领海、领空、内河、矿业等一切主权，换取美帝国主义的洋枪、洋炮，直接屠杀自己的同胞。
    我兄是爱国军人，不忍睹此残暴行为，毅然跳出内战烽火，走向光荣的民主阵营来，这是我们电讯界的光荣！
    我们应号召更多的同仁，步你的后尘，陆续退出内战。走向人民方面来，为和平民主服务。
    我是去年，上党战役过来的，一切很好。现在军官教导团学习，跳出了泥坑，得到了新生，目前正学习为和平民主而奋斗的本领。将来在伟大革命事业上，让我们携手共同奋斗吧！
     弟白凤翘
