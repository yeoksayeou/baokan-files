Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Chongqing News: The "National Daily" newspaper office, founded by local figures in Sichuan, was suddenly completely destroyed by more than ten secret agent thugs on the 10th, with losses exceeding 100 million yuan. Several employees were also arrested. That afternoon, three workers from the newspaper were washing in the river near the newspaper office in the Jiangbian River when they accidentally splashed water on a nearby ferry, leading to an argument. Unexpectedly, this incident was seized upon by secret agent thugs who had long harbored hatred for the newspaper as an excuse. They immediately gathered more than a hundred people, with ferocious expressions and wielding iron rulers, and stormed into the newspaper's printing factory and editorial department in Hualong Bridge. They beat anyone they encountered and destroyed everything they saw. The typesetting room, machine room, plate-making workshop, editorial department, employee dormitories, and kitchen were all completely wrecked. After beating the editors and staff of the newspaper, several people were arrested before the secret agents swaggered away, having wreaked havoc for an hour. The newspaper has now lodged a serious protest with the authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Kunming News: Following the Li-Wen incident (referring to the assassination of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo), Liu Zhihuan, former secretary of the Kunming Municipal Government, and Sun Duolan, wife of Liu Shishang, former chief of staff of the Kunming Xingying military headquarters, were also assassinated. On the evening of the 25th, after watching a play at the provincial party headquarters, Liu escorted Sun in a car back home. On the way, near Xiaoximen Xiaozhuan Tang New Village, the driver falsely claimed that the oil had run out and stopped the car. Secret agent thugs lying in wait there immediately opened fire on Liu and Sun. Both were wounded on the spot and fell in the car, while the secret agent thugs escaped safely. Later, they were discovered and Liu and Sun were sent to the hospital for treatment. Liu was shot in the right cheek, and his tongue was pierced. Sun was shot in the left cheek, and the bone was shattered. Her injuries were very serious.
