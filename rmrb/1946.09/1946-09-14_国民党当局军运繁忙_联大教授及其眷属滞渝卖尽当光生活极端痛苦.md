Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: According to the Tianjin University Gazette of August 29th and September 1st, over 200 faculty members and their families from the former Southwest Associated University (Lian Da) are stranded in Chongqing, unable to return, and are living in extreme poverty. Professor Zhou Binglin received a telegram from Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei on August 30th stating that air transport has been busy recently and that no special planes can be allocated for the professors. Currently, the professors are planning to stay in Chongqing for an extended period and go to the Central Library to read every day. Professors Yuan Fuli, Yu Ruihuang, and Li Guangtian said, "We sold our bedding when we left Kunming. If we stay in Chongqing for a long time, everything will become a problem. The children have started to get sick, and the money is all used up." According to the Chongqing edition of the gazette, after Professor Wen Yiduo of Lian Da was murdered by special agents, no decent cloth garment could be found in his residence to use as a "shroud." Wen had not worn a new piece of clothing in eight years. Before the cremation, the university helped to buy a blue gown. The difficulty of the professors' lives can be imagined.

    联大教授及其眷属滞渝卖尽当光生活极端痛苦
    【新华社延安十一日电】据八月二十九日、九月一日津大公报载：联大滞渝教授及眷属二百余人，无法复员，生活极为痛苦。周炳琳教授八月三十日接交通部长俞大维电称：近来空运繁忙，无法为各教授增拨专机。目下各教授已在渝作久居之计，每天到中央图书馆读书。据袁复礼、余瑞璜、李广田诸教授谈：“我们离昆时已把被盖卖掉，如久滞渝，一切均成问题。小孩已开始生病，钱也用光。”又据该报渝版近载：联大闻一多教授在被特务凶杀后，其住宅内竟找不出一件像样的布衣以作“寿衣”。八年来闻氏就未穿过一件新衣服，火葬前由联大校方帮助才买了一件蓝色大衫。教授们生活之困难可知。
