　　Linqing Holds Mass Meeting at People's Park
    Public Trial of Arch-Traitor Cheng Xi, Xu Tongpu
    Over a Hundred Pseudo-Personnel Repent and Re-Reform in Three Days
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 6th dispatch] Xu Huzi and Cheng Bozi, the extremely heinous traitors of Linqing City, were publicly tried and executed by firing squad by over ten thousand people a few days ago. Over ten thousand people from the first, second, and third districts of Linqing City and the second, third, and fourth districts of Linqing County gathered at the People's Park to publicly try the die-hard traitors Xu Huzi and Cheng Bozi. Traitor Xu's original name was Xu Tongpu. He served as a construction staff member in the puppet county government, building roads, leveling airfields, and constructing blockhouses for the enemy, beating, scolding, and extorting the masses in every possible way. Citizen Liu Jiansheng was old and weak. When he was on a business trip, he was beaten half to death for being slightly late and forced to carry bricks, kneeling in the hot sun. At the meeting, Jiang Zhangshi of Gulou Street tearfully recounted: "Xu Huzi built an airfield for the Japanese devils, leveled several of our family's graves, and forced open my father's coffin, robbing the gold and silver jewelry from the corpse. Xu Huzi's crimes are too numerous to count. From the 31st to the 34th year of the Republic of China alone, he forced the masses to build fourteen pillboxes and three trenches for the enemy, extorting 130,000 yuan from the masses. The masses suffered much abuse and torture, and more than fifty people were beaten to death or injured. Cheng Bozi's original name was Cheng Xi. He served as a puppet police chief, police officer, and other positions, serving the enemy wholeheartedly, capturing and killing anti-Japanese personnel. Comrade Zhuang Tian Jiufeng was arrested by Cheng Bozi and handed over to the enemy when he went home on business that night. When Traitor Cheng saw that Liu Erni of Jiaodao Street was beautiful, he falsely accused her husband of being a "Eighth Route" soldier, murdered him, and occupied Erni; however, after playing with her for more than ten days, he drove Erni out again. Erni, filled with shame and indignation, went mad and died on the street, leaving Erni's old mother lonely and weeping all day long. After the two traitors were arrested, the government received more than a hundred indictments from the people. The government accepted the people's demands and Commissioner Bei announced the death sentence for the two traitors, Xu and Cheng, and carried out the execution by firing squad.
    [Another dispatch] In the villages in the eastern part of Linqing, after the initial liberation of Dezhou, a group of puppet army and puppet organization personnel who had fled back initially harbored doubts about us and mostly remained hidden. In order to enable them to understand the government's lenient policy, district cadres held mass meetings in various villages to carry out propaganda and explanation and cooperated with village cadres and released convicts who had returned to the village to individually persuade and mobilize them. This has had a significant effect. Within three days, 135 members of the puppet army and puppet organizations from twelve villages went to the government to repent and reform. The government also launched a confession competition, mobilizing those who had repented to go back and persuade others. The policy of leniency and confession has achieved great success in the area.

    三天内百余伪人员悔过自新
    【本报威县六日电】临清市罪大恶极之汉奸徐胡子、程跛子，已于日前经万余群众公审枪决。该市一二三区及临清县二、三、四等十几个区群众万余人，集会大众公园公审死心踏地的大汉奸徐胡子和程跛子。徐逆原名徐桐圃，曾任伪县公署建设科员，替敌人修公路，平机场，筑碉堡，打骂讹榨群众无所不为。市民刘建生年老力衰，出差时稍微迟慢即被打至半死并被迫顶砖，跪于烈日下。会上古楼街姜张氏声泪俱下的诉说：“徐胡子给鬼子修飞机场，掘平了俺家几座坟，还强迫打开俺爹棺材，抢去尸首上的金银首饰。徐胡子罪恶多端不胜枚举，仅国民卅一年到卅四年三中年即强迫群众替敌人修盖了十四个炮楼，和三道壕沟，从中榨取群众十三万元；群众备多虐待摧残，被殴死伤达五十余人之多。程跛子原名程喜，曾任伪警长，警官等职，死心事敌，捕杀抗日人员，有庄田九峰同志因事回家，当夜即被程跛子捕去献与敌人。程逆见夹道街刘二妮貌美即诬其夫为“八路”将其害死、霸占二妮；但玩弄十余天后又将二妮逐出，二妮羞愤交集疯死街头，剩下二妮老母孤苦伶仃，终日啼泣。二逆被捕后政府前后收到人民控诉状百余件，政府接受群众要求由贝专员宣布徐、程二逆死刑执行枪决。
    【又讯】临清东部各村，在德州初解放后，逃回一部伪军伪组织人员，初因对我疑惑，多隐蔽不出。区干部为使彼等了解政府的宽大政策，乃在各村召开群众大会，进行宣传解释并配合村干及回村的结案犯人个别说服动员已发生重大效果，三天内十二个村即有伪军伪组织人员一百三十五名到政府悔过自新。政府并发动坦白竞赛，发动悔过者回去去劝说别人。宽大、坦白政策在该区已收到很大成绩。
