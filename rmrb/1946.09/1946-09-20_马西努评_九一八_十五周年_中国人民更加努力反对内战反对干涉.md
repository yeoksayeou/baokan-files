　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 17th: Moscow Radio broadcast Marcinow's comments on the Chinese situation on the 16th, stating: The 15th anniversary of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (i.e., the September 18th Incident) is approaching. On September 18th, 1931, the Kuomintang was using all its strength to carry out the civil war and adopted a policy of non-resistance towards Japan, selling out Manchuria and North China. However, the Chinese Communist Party resolutely carried out the war of resistance and entered Manchuria, organizing 300,000 anti-Japanese troops (i.e., the later Anti-Japanese United Army) in a very short period of time. At the same time, the People's Revolutionary Army also broke through the Kuomintang's massive encirclement and headed to North China, the front line of the War of Resistance, advancing all the way to Ji-Re-Liao, and establishing liberated areas in one-third of China's territory. Today, the Chinese civil war is even more widespread than it was then. The Kuomintang is using 90% of its forces, with American equipment and aircraft, to attack the liberated areas, attempting to seize the fruits of victory that the people won against Japan. They are carrying out military offensives with the assistance of foreign capital, while foreign capital is using the Kuomintang reactionaries to implement Japan's plan of "using Chinese to control Chinese." Foreign capital is not only helping the Kuomintang with finances and munitions to carry out the civil war, but is even directly participating in this war. The Chinese people are calling for even greater efforts to oppose the civil war and oppose American armed intervention on the 15th anniversary of the September 18th Incident.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 16th: Moscow, 15th: Pravda observer Markov commented on the US policy towards China, pointing out that it has been a year since the Japanese aggressors were defeated, but the Chinese people have not yet obtained peace. World News and Commentary explained that "this is the result of American imperialism implementing an aggressive policy in China. American reactionary financial groups are taking advantage of the fact that their main competitor, Japan, has been eliminated, and competition from Britain and France has also weakened, in an attempt to 'conquer' the Chinese market and make the Chinese economy completely subordinate to the interests of American monopoly capital." The observer stated that this is why the United States supports the Kuomintang reactionaries, because the latter is willing to offer China to foreign capital in order to maintain its position as landlords and financial capitalists. This is the reason why the American reactionaries and monopoly capital do not intend to achieve political and economic unification and genuine democratization in China, and therefore the United States is openly carrying out armed intervention in China's internal affairs. After listing the facts of the US helping the Kuomintang transport troops and directly participating in the Chinese civil war, Markov said: The actions of the US military have aroused the anger of Chinese and world public opinion, so the US government has allowed the withdrawal of US troops stationed in China several times, but the US military is still in China and is providing extensive assistance to the Kuomintang's civil war against the people. The United States is not only using Kuomintang troops to carry out civil war in the Northeast, but also has hundreds of American officers in every Kuomintang army.

　　马西努评“九一八”十五周年
    中国人民更加努力反对内战反对干涉
    【新华社延安十七日电】莫斯科十六日广播马西努评中国时局称：日本侵略满洲第十五周年纪念日（即九一八）快到了。一九三一年“九一八”，国民党正用全力进行内战，而对日本采取不抵抗政策，出卖了满洲和华北，而中国共产党却坚决进行抗战，并进入满洲，在很短时期内组织了三十万抗日军（即后来的抗日联军）；同时人民革命军也冲破了国民党的大军包围开赴抗日前线的华北，一直挺进到冀热辽，在中国三分之一土地上，建立了解放区。今天中国内战比那时更扩大，国民党利用百分之九十的兵力，用美国的装备及飞机进攻解放区，企图夺取人民战胜日本所获得的胜利果实。他们在外国资本援助下进行军事进攻，而外国资本则利用国民党反动派实行日本“以华制华”的计划。外国资本不仅在财政与军火上帮助国民党进行内战，甚至直接参加这一战争。中国人民号召在“九一八”十五周年纪念日，更加努力反对内战反对美国武装干涉。
    【新华社延安十六日电】莫斯科十五日讯：真理报观察家玛可夫评美国对华政策，指出日本侵略者被击溃已一年，但中国人民尚未得到和平。世界新闻与评论解释“这是美国帝国主义在中国实行侵略政策的结果。美国反动财阀们利用主要竞争者日本已被消灭、英法方面的竞争也已减弱，企图“征服”中国市场，使中国经济完全隶属于美国独占资本的利益”。观察家称因此美国才支持国民党反动派，因为后者情愿将中国奉送给外国资本，借此保持其地主财政资本家的地位。这将是美国反动派与独占资本不打算使中国政治经济统一及真正民主化的原因，也因此美国才公开武装干涉中国内政。玛可夫在列举美帮助国民党运兵及直接参加中国内战的事实后说：美军的行动激起了中国与世界舆论的愤怒，因此美政府曾几次允许撤退驻华美军，而迄今美军仍在中国，并对国民党反对人民的内战予以广泛的协助。美国不仅用国民党军队到东北进行内战，而且在国民党每个军中都有数百美国军官。
