Eternal Radiance
——Do Not Forget Comrade Luo Dengxian, Founder of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army!
	Feng Zhongyun
    *This article was written by Comrade Feng Zhongyun, one of the leaders of the former Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's Third Army and current Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government, in commemoration of the "September 18th" Incident.*

    I remember in the autumn of 1931, not many days after the "September 18th" Incident, Comrade Luo Dengxian convened a meeting of senior Chinese Communist Party cadres in northern Manchuria at my home on Hongjiang's seven small sand islands on Touguan Street in Daowai, Harbin. At this meeting, Comrade Dengxian said, "Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang is selling out our Northeast compatriots with a policy of non-resistance. We Chinese Communists must share weal and woe with the people of the Northeast and strive for the liberation of the Northeast." "Wherever the enemy tramples on our compatriots, we Communists will fight alongside the people." "No one in the Party is allowed to propose leaving the Northeast. Anyone who makes such a request is a cowardly and wavering element and not a Chinese Communist Party member."

    Comrade Dengxian's instruction strengthened the determination of the Northeast Communists to fight for themselves, for the motherland, and for the liberation of the Northeast. Under this determination, the glorious achievement of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army's fourteen years of arduous and isolated struggle was established.

    Comrade Dengxian was a worker leader during the Hong Kong General Strike of the Chinese Great Revolution. He was a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee elected by the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Around the time of the "September 18th" Incident, he was the representative of the CPC Central Committee stationed in the Northeast and also served as the Secretary of the CPC Manchuria Provincial Committee, and was the main person in charge of the CPC Manchuria Branch at that time. No communist in the Northeast did not know "Daping," and "Daping" was his pseudonym. He led the anti-Japanese struggle in the Northeast with the great spirit of leading the Hong Kong strike, and this anti-Japanese struggle eventually burned for fourteen years under his leadership.

    In the spring of the year following the "September 18th" Incident, I remember him returning to Harbin from Shenyang, bringing back the "Red Flag Newspaper" published by the CPC Central Committee. This newspaper contained an article by Comrade "Wuhao" (Zhou Enlai), pointing out that a national revolutionary war must be launched in the Northeast to oppose the Japanese invaders and drive them out of the Northeast. Comrade Dengxian, based on this instruction from the CPC Central Committee, put forward the slogan within the Northeast Party that Communists should go to the countryside to launch anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. The Communists in the Northeast basically carried out this instruction.

    During his time in the Northeast, Comrade Luo Dengxian led the people in creating the Jiliao Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, the Hailun Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, the Panshi and Hailong Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, the Eastern Manchurian Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, the Tangyuan Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, and others. These guerrilla forces later constituted the various armies of the Anti-Japanese United Army. Under the leadership of Comrade Luo Dengxian, a large number of advanced workers, patriotic intellectuals, and Communists were sent to participate in the anti-Japanese forces of Li Du, Ma Zhanshan, Wang Delin, and others, calling for a united anti-Japanese front. Under his leadership, anti-Japanese movements were launched in Harbin, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places, rising from passive resistance strikes to armed struggle.

    In the autumn of 1932, I was sent to Tangyuan by Comrade Dengxian to create a guerrilla force. In a small house at a certain number on Jilin Street in Nangang, Harbin, he instructed me on the work tasks and methods after going to Xiajiang, which are still deeply imprinted in my mind. In 1933, I returned from Tangyuan after organizing the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force, but I did not see Comrade Dengxian, as he had already gone to Shenyang to guide the work.

    Comrade Dengxian was chased by the enemy several times in Shenyang, but fortunately, he escaped. Later, because the enemy's pursuit of him in the Northeast was too urgent, he returned to Shanghai to work under the decision of the CPC Central Committee.

    Upon arriving in Shanghai, he participated in the leadership of the National General Trade Union. Within a few months, he organized an anti-Japanese strike at the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. However, due to a traitor's betrayal, he was finally arrested by imperialist elements.

    I remember that Ms. Soong Ching Ling once issued a declaration to rescue Comrade Luo Dengxian. The declaration described the situation when Comrade Dengxian was tried in the Shanghai Mixed Court. Comrade Luo Dengxian resolutely declared, "Do you think I am reactionary? Let me tell you my history! I led the anti-imperialist general strike in the Chinese Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927. I launched the anti-Japanese and national salvation guerrilla movement in the Northeast; I recently returned from the Northeast and led the anti-Japanese strike at the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai. All my actions are anti-imperialist and patriotic. Who dares to say they are reactionary!"

    However, Comrade Dengxian was not released because of Mrs. Sun's rescue and the great justice of his cause. He was finally handed over by the bloody hands of imperialism to the bloody hands of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing Prison. After a long period of friends visiting him, he was covered in blood and whip marks. He, who was originally thin, was even more emaciated. However, his eyes were still bright, showing his indomitable spirit. He told his visiting friends, "They beat me, but they cannot subdue my will to always be loyal to the people and the motherland." He did not show any signs of discouragement, nor did he shed a single tear. As he left his friends, he left behind a stubborn figure.

    On a drizzly dark night in the summer of 1934, under the order of the traitorous executioner Chiang Kai-shek, Comrade Luo Dengxian, the founder of our Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and loyal leader of the Communist Party of China, passed away in a desolate burst of gunfire!

    The people of the Northeast will never forget the pain of fourteen years of subjugation after the "September 18th" Incident, will never forget the crime of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in selling out the Northeast with a policy of non-resistance, and will never forget the slaughter of their anti-Japanese leader Comrade Luo Dengxian by Chiang Kai-shek's executioners. All the servants of the people of the Northeast will forever inherit his spirit and fight to victory.

### 永恒的光辉——不要忘记东北抗联创始者罗登贤同志！

　　永恒的光辉
　　——不要忘记东北抗联创始者罗登贤同志！
　　冯仲云
    本文是前东北抗日联军第三军领导人之一，现松江省府主席冯仲云同志为纪念“九一八”而作。
    我记得一九三一年秋，“九一八”事变后不几天，在哈尔滨道外头关街的宏江七个小沙岛上我的家里，罗登贤同志召集了北满中国共产党高级干部会议。在这次会议上，登贤同志说：“蒋介石国民党以不抵抗政策出卖东北同胞，我们中国共产党人一定与东北人民同患难共生死，争取东北人民的解放。”“敌人在那儿蹂躏我们同胞，我们共产党人就在那儿和人民一起抗争。”“党内不许任何人提出离开东北的要求，谁如果要提出这样的要求，那就是恐惧动摇分子，谁就不是中国共产党员。”
    登贤同志这个指示，坚定了东北共产党人为自己，为祖国，为东北解放的决心。在这个决心下，才建立起了东北抗联十四年孤军苦战的光荣业绩。
    登贤同志，是在中国大革命时期香港大罢工的工人领袖，他是中国共产党第六次代表大会选出的中共中央政治局委员。“九一八”前后，他在东北是中共中央驻东北的代表，并兼任中共满洲省委书记，是当时中共满洲支部主要负责人。东北的共产党员没有不知“达平”的，而“达平”就是他的化名。他以领导香港罢工的伟大精神，来领导东北抗日斗争，而这个抗日斗争终于在他领导之下燃烧了十四年之久。
    “九一八”事变的次年春，我记得他从沈阳又回到哈尔滨，带回了中共中央出版的《红旗报》，在这份报上，载着“伍豪”（周恩来）同志的论文，指出在东北必须发动民族革命战争来反对日寇，驱逐日寇出东北。登贤同志就根据中共中央这一指示，在东北党内提出了共产党员要下乡发动抗日游击战争的口号。而东北的共产党员基本上是执行了这个指示的。
    登贤同志在东北期间，曾领导人民创造起吉辽反日游击队、海伦反日游击队、磐石及海龙反日游击队、东满反日游击队、汤原反日游击队等。这些游击队后来就构成抗日联军的各军。在罗登贤同志领导之下，曾派大批的先进工人和爱国的知识分子及共产党员参加当时的李杜、马占山、王德林等抗日部队，号召反日统一战线。在他领导之下，曾发动了哈尔滨、沈阳、大连以及各地的抗日运动，从消极抵抗罢工提高到武装斗争。
    一九三二年秋，我被登贤同志派赴汤原创造游击队，他在哈市南岗吉林街某号小房内，指示我去下江后的工作任务和方法，直到现在我还深印在脑海中。一九三三年，我从汤原组织了反日游击队归来，未曾见到登贤同志，那时他已去沈阳指导工作。
    登贤同志到沈阳几次遭到敌人的追捕，幸而脱脸。后来因为敌人在东北对他追捕过急，于是他在中共中央决定之下回到上海进行工作。
    他到上海即参加了全国总工会的领导工作，数月间他就组织起上海日本纱厂的反日罢工。但是由于叛徒的告密，他终于被帝国主义分子所逮捕。
    我记得宋庆龄先生曾经为了营救罗登贤同志发表宣言。在宣言中曾经描写过登贤同志在上海会审，公堂受审判时的情形，罗登贤同志倔强的声明：“你们认为是我反动吗？让我来告诉你们我的历史吧！我曾经在一九二五年——一九二七年中国大革命中间领导过反帝大罢工，我曾经在东北发动过抗日救国的游击运动；最近才从东北回来不久，又领导了上海日本纱厂的反日大罢工，我这一切行动都是反帝爱国的，谁敢说是反动！”
    但登贤同志并未因孙夫人之营救和他的事业的伟大正义性而得到释放，终于由帝国主义的血手送交卖国贼蒋介石的血腥的魔手中，他被蒋介石囚于南京监狱中。经过一个长时期朋友们去探他，他带着满身血迹鞭痕，本来是瘦弱的他，更加骨瘦如柴。然而他眼睛依然炯炯有光，表现着他的不屈不挠的精神。他告诉探视他的朋友说：“他们打我，然而不能屈服我始终忠实于人民和祖国的意志。”他并不曾表示丝毫沮丧，并没有落过一滴眼泪，当他离开他的朋友时，留下一个倔强的背影。
    一九三四年夏季一个细雨蒙蒙的黑夜，在卖国贼刽子手蒋介石的命令之下，我东北抗日联军的创始人，忠勇的中共领袖罗登贤同志，在凄然的枪声中与世长离了！
    东北人民是永世不忘“九一八”后十四年沦陷的惨痛的，永世不忘卖国贼蒋介石以不抵抗政策出卖东北的罪恶的，永世不忘蒋介石刽子手屠杀了他们的抗战领导者罗登贤同志的。所有东北人民的勤务员，将永远继承他的精神一直战斗到胜利。
