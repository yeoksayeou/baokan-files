Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Warsaw Radio: Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka (Communist) gave a speech at a mass rally in Warsaw on the 8th, commenting on US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart opposing the cession of eastern Germany to Poland. He said that the Polish people would draw the following conclusion from Byrnes' speech: "Strengthen Poland's internal unity, because no Pole can befriend those who treat our most important guarantee (i.e., the western border) in a hostile manner." Referring to the US-British note on the Polish elections, Gomulka said: "We will fulfill our electoral obligations without any pressure. Demonstrations against Byrnes' speech have sprung up all over Poland and are still continuing on the 11th. In Lodz, tens of thousands of people marched in the streets after a mass rally jointly convened by various parties. Polish trade unions passed a resolution demanding that American and British workers rise up and fight against the reactionaries who are trying to revive German imperialism.

    【新华社延安十二日电】华沙广播：波兰副总理哥穆尔卡（共产党）八日在华沙群众集会上演说，评论美国务卿贝纳斯在斯图加德的演说中反对将德国东部让予波兰。他说波兰人民从贝氏演说中会得出这样的结论：“加强波兰内部的团结，因为对于那些以敌视的方式来对待我们最重要的保证（即西部疆界）的人，是没有一个波兰人能与之为友的”。谈及美英关于波兰选举的照会时，哥氏称：“我们将不受任何压力而完成我们选举的义务。波兰各地反对贝纳斯演说的示威风起云涌，迄十一日仍在继续中。在罗兹在各党派联合召开的群众大会后，有数万人在街道上游行示威，波兰各工会通过一决议，要求美英工人起来与企图复活德国帝国主义的反动派作斗争。
