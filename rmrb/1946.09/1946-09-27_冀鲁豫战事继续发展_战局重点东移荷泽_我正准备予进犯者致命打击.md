　　[This newspaper's report from the Longhai Front on the 25th] Our front-line reporter Fang De reported: The focus of the war in the Jilu Yu region has now shifted from the western line of Kaocheng, Cao County, and other places to the central area of ​​Dingtao and Heze. In addition to transferring the 85th and 32nd Divisions and other units originally stationed in northern Henan to the western part of the Jilu Yu region to cooperate with the offensive of the central Chiang troops, the war in this area is continuing to develop. When Chiang's army occupied Heze, the center of our Jilu Yu region, this time, it paid a considerable price and its progress was very slow. It is only forty-five miles from Dingtao to Heze City. The invading army, consisting of the remnants of the 68th, 55th, 41st, and 47th Divisions, and the 4th Column of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's forces, spent a week before entering our empty city of Heze on the 20th, after our army victoriously completed its mission and was ordered to transfer to a new position. It is estimated that the daily average progress was only slightly less than six li. On the 18th, in a battle southeast of Heze, our army wounded the commander of the 45th Division, Hu Changqing, and others. The vigorous mass guerrilla warfare in the area has made Chiang's army feel deeply uneasy. After our military and civilians in the entire Jilu Yu region lured Chiang's army into a pocket encirclement, they are preparing to deal a fatal blow to the invading army and restore the lost land.
　　[This newspaper's report from the Jilu Yu Front on the 24th] The remnants of Chen Zongqiao's 41st Division of Chiang's army, which had been defeated and retreated after its first invasion into the hinterland of Jilu Yu, received Chiang Kai-shek's order again. On the 19th, they invaded north from Matouji, northeast of Kaocheng. At 3 pm on the 21st, they fell into our Dongming County again. The next day, they attacked Yuzhou Village east of the city and were counterattacked by our army and retreated to Dongming County. After the invading army entered the city, it prohibited pedestrians from entering and leaving, forcibly ordered shops to close, and arrested soldiers from door to door. Those who escaped were shot. The masses were extremely resentful.
　　[This newspaper's report from the Jilu Yu Front on the 24th] More than 50 members of the puppet army Zhi Yongde's unit, entrenched in Anrenji, thirty miles southwest of Chengwu, were completely annihilated by our local armed forces and militia on the 21st of this month, and more than 50 rifles were seized.

　　冀鲁豫战事继续发展
　　战局重点东移荷泽
　　我正准备予进犯者致命打击
    【本报陇海前线二十五日电】本报前线记者方德报导：冀鲁豫战争重点，现已由西线考城、曹县等地转至中部定陶、荷泽一带。蒋介石除将原驻豫北之八十五、三十二师等部调至冀鲁豫西部地区，以配合中路蒋军之进攻外，该地区战事现正在继续发展。蒋军此次占领我冀鲁豫中心荷泽时，曾付相当重大代价，进度十分迟缓，自定陶至荷泽城仅四十五里，进犯军六十八、五十五、四十一、四十七师残部，及伪张岚峰部第四纵队等，共费时一周，始于二十日我军胜利完成任务、奉命转移至新阵地后进抵我荷泽空城。计每日平均只进展六华里弱。十八日，荷泽东南一战，我军并将其四十五师师长胡长清等击伤。该地蓬勃开展的群众游击战争，使蒋军深感不安。我冀鲁豫全区军民诱致蒋军进入袋形包围圈后，正准备予进犯军致命打击，重新恢复失去的土地。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十四日电】第一次进犯冀鲁豫腹地被击溃退之蒋军第四十一师陈宗樵残部，复奉到蒋介石命令，十九日自考城东北之马头集北犯，二十一日下午三时再陷我东明县城，次日出犯城东宇宙屯，当遭我军反击，退守东明县城。进犯军进城后，禁止行人进出，强令商号停业，挨门挨户抓兵，遇逃避者即开枪射击，群众痛恨异常。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十四日电】盘踞城武西南三十里安仁集之伪军智永德部五十余人，本月二十一日，被我当地地方武装及民兵全部歼灭，缴获步枪五十余支。
