Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st -- According to the U.S. Information Service and other Washington sources: U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace released on the night of the 17th a letter he wrote to Truman on July 23rd, a twelve-page document detailing a plan for the control of atomic energy. The letter urged Truman to "prevent the new trend of isolationism and the catastrophic atomic world war," and advocated for improving U.S.-Soviet relations. Excerpts are as follows:

Regarding the issue of U.S.-Soviet relations, the letter strongly stated: "A war against the Soviet Union would inevitably lead to a catastrophe for all mankind, therefore, we must seek a way to coexist peacefully." It also stated: "We should start from a new perspective, that is, we should base it on the prerequisites that the Soviet Union needs to build world order through peaceful cooperation. We are prepared, even at the cost of appeasement, to agree that the Soviet Union has reasonable security guarantees." The letter suggested sending a trade mission to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviets to promote a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement. Another purpose of the mission was to formulate various proposals, including jointly rebuilding the industries and economies of regions where both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have interests, such as the Middle East. The letter stated: "Successful economic negotiations will help us bridge the gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Military force cannot guarantee security; to seek peace, mutual trust is necessary first."

The letter put forward suggestions on the atomic bomb and criticized the use of the atomic bomb to threaten the Soviet Union, stating: There is a military school of thought that advocates "attacking the Soviet Union before they have the atomic bomb. This plan is not only immoral, but also stupid." The letter pointed out: The world can no longer rely on superior military force to maintain peace. "Having a large number of atomic bombs does not mean gaining a decisive advantage. If other countries also have atomic bombs, they can also destroy our major cities and heavy industries." The letter advocated "destroying atomic weapons and establishing an effective organization to eliminate atomic weapons." It also criticized the Baruch Plan for the control of atomic energy, saying that this is equivalent to "telling" the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union is like a child, we may eventually transfer the knowledge about atomic energy to them and other countries. If we stick to our own opinions, the result will inevitably be a deadlock, forcing the Soviet Union to double its efforts to manufacture atomic bombs and decide to expand its security zone.

The letter concluded by opposing the domestic notion of "unity based on creating conflicts in the world abroad," saying: "This is not only unsafe, but also disastrous." Because the overly active unity of the two parties domestically leads to concessions to isolationism, and isolationism then expresses a stubborn realist mask in international affairs. The letter urged Truman to "provide progressive leadership according to the path he suggested, and avoid falling back into isolationism and a tragic world atomic war."

　　华氏致杜鲁门原函摘要
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据美新闻处等华盛顿讯：美商务部长华莱士十七日夜发表其于七月二十三日与杜鲁门一函，长达十二页，该函详述原子能管制计划，该函要求杜鲁门“阻止孤立主义的新倾向与灾难的原子世界大战”，并主张改善美苏关系，摘要如下：
    关于对美苏关系问题，该函力称：“为了对苏战争，势必造成全人类之浩劫，因此必须觅取和平相处之方法。”并称：“我们应自新观点出发，即应基于苏联制造和平合作共建世界秩序所需要之先决条件，我们准备甚至不惜采取绥靖政策，同意苏联拥有合理之安全保证。”该函建议派一贸易使团前往莫斯科与苏谈判，促进美苏贸易协定，该使团另一目的为拟定各种建议，包括共同重建美苏两国均有利益地区之工业与经济，如中东等。该函称：“成功的经济谈判，将协助我们填平介于美苏两国间的鸿沟，武力不能保障安全，须求和平须先互信。”
    该函提出对原子弹之建议，并批评以原子弹威胁苏联称：有一种军事思想派主张“在苏联拥有原子弹前，先下手为强，向苏联进攻，这种计划非但不道德，而且也愚蠢”该函指出：世界已不能仰赖优势武力而从事维持和平。“拥有大量原子弹，并非取得决定性优势之谓，如他国亦拥有原子弹，亦同样能摧毁我们的主要城市及重工业”。该函主张“毁灭原子武器，并设立解除原子武装之有效机构”。并批评巴鲁区控制原子能计划说，这等于“正告”苏联，如果苏联是如孩子，则我们最后或可将有关原子能知识移交彼等及其他各国。我们如坚持已见，则结果必陷于僵局，而使苏联加倍努力制造原子弹，并决定扩大其安全区。
    该函结论，反对国内“基于在国外世界造成冲突的基础上的团结”说：“这不仅是不安全的，而且是灾难的。”因求国内两党的过于积极团结，致对孤立主义让步，孤立主义跟着在国际事务上表示顽强的现实主义假面具。该函要求杜鲁门“依照他所建议之路线，而予以进步之领导，避免重陷于孤立主义及悲惨之世界原子战争”。
