　　Taiyue Labor Hero Shi Zhenming
    Organizes Mutual Aid, Saving 20,000 Workdays in Half a Year
    [Report from Yangcheng by this newspaper] After the mobilization of the masses in Fushan Second District, Fan Village, 135 out of 379 households in the whole village improved their status. The number of wealthy peasants increased from 25 to 37, middle peasants from 84 to 190, and tenant farmers decreased from 210 to 120. The enthusiasm of the masses for production is unprecedentedly high. The mutual aid team led by Shi Zhenming, a first-class labor hero of Taiyue, has been growing and expanding day by day on this basis. Last year, the mutual aid team had only 360 people, but this year it has organized 792 people, an increase of more than double, accounting for 55 percent of the total population of the village, including 400 women. In the past six months, the mutual aid team has cultivated more than 6,000 mu of land, accounting for 87 percent of the village's land, saving a total of more than 11,000 workdays. However, Shi Zhenming is not complacent. At the end of May, he organized the mutual aid teams of Fan Village, Yuantou and other five administrative villages into a joint mutual aid team of five villages, to adjust the lack of labor, strengthen the unity and exchange of experience between villages, and solve the difficulties that the leadership cannot take care of. The highest leading organ is the joint brigade headquarters, and the following five administrative villages are compiled into five squadrons. In the month or so since the establishment of the joint mutual aid brigade, it has organized 2,481 full and semi-laborers, accounting for 70 percent of the total labor force of the five villages. It has hoed more than 16,600 mu of corn and more than 10,500 mu of millet (both hoed three times), saving a total of more than 14,500 workdays. It has reclaimed 2,210 mu of wasteland, repaired 50 mu of tidal flats, and earned more than 410,000 yuan from transportation, silkworm breeding, and weaving.
