[Dispatch from this newspaper in Heze, 16th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who have once again invaded the Heze area in the heart of our Ji-Lu-Yu region, are currently advancing step by step. The 11th Division of Qiu Qingquan's 5th Army advanced from Dingtao along one route, attacking Miaozuodian southeast of Heze, but were intercepted. On the 13th, they retreated to Huangdian to the south, while another route advanced to Beixiezhuang, west of Huangdian. At the same time, the 54th Division of the 5th Army stretched further north. Its right wing attacked Jinjitou, 30 li directly south of Heze, on the 14th. Its left wing follow-up troops also pressed towards Maji and Yangchangzhai southwest of Heze. Division Commander Hu Changqing personally supervised the battle at the Dingtao front. Liu Ruming's 68th Army and the 2nd Detachment of the Provisional 4th Column under the puppet Zhang Fengfeng followed behind the 5th Army and occupied the Weiwan and Zhou Laiyuan areas northwest of Cao County, and are now attempting to advance towards Anlingji, 50 li southwest of Heze.

　　犯冀鲁豫蒋军继续冒险深入
    【本报荷泽十六日电】再度进犯我冀鲁豫腹心地带荷泽一带蒋军，现正节节推进中。第五军邱清泉部第十一师自定陶出动一路犯我荷泽东南之苗左店被阻击后，十三日退至南面之黄店，其另一路则进至黄店以西之北谢庄。与此同时，第五军五十四师更往北伸进，其右翼十四日进犯我荷泽正南三十里之金鸡头，其左翼后续部队亦逼进荷泽西南之马集、杨常砦一带，师长胡长清并亲临定陶前线督战。刘汝明之六十八军及伪张风峰部暂编四纵队二支队，则继第五军之后，进占我曹县西北魏湾、周莱园一带，现企图向我荷泽西南五十里之安陵集一带推进。
