　　Editor's Note: This material is extracted and edited from the book "Research on Manchurian Communist Bandits" compiled by the Advisory Department of the Puppet Manchukuo Military and Political Department. From these materials from the enemy and puppets, we can see how the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army led the people of Northeast China in actively carrying out the anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese struggle after the "September 18th Incident." The titles in the text are added by the editor. The book was published in 1936 and marked "Top Secret."

　　I. Overview
　　Establishment of Party Departments, Armed Forces, and Anti-Japanese Associations (Editor's note: The Party department section is omitted)
　　The process of establishing the People's Revolutionary Army is as follows:
　　(1) The First Independent Division of the First Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army in the South Manchurian Guerrilla Area was established in August 1933 (reorganized around the former South Manchurian Guerrilla Detachment of the 32nd Army of the Red Army); the Second Independent Division was established in November 1934.
　　(2) The First Independent Division of the Second Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army in the East Manchurian Guerrilla Area was established in March 1934; the Second Division of the Second Army was established in May 1934.
　　(3) The Zhuhe Red Guerrilla Detachment in the Harbin-East Guerrilla Area was established in the summer of 1933; the First Independent Division of the Third Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army was established in January 1935 (based on the Zhuhe Red Guerrilla Detachment).
　　(4) The Ning'an Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment in the Suining and Mi'rao areas was established in April 1934; the Raohe Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment was established in July 1933; the Mishan Red Guerrilla Detachment was established in December 1933; the Fourth Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established in February 1935 (based on the Raohe and Mishan Guerrilla Detachments); the Fifth Army of the United Army was established in February 1935 (based on the Ning'an Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment).
　　(5) The Tangyuan Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment in the Tangyuan Guerrilla Area was established at the end of 1933; the Sixth Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established in June 1935 (based on the "bandit" Xie Wentong).
　　(6) Hailun Red Guerrilla Detachment in the Hailun Guerrilla Area.
　　After the Manchurian Incident, all Anti-Imperialist Alliances were renamed Anti-Japanese Associations. By the spring of 1935, a preparatory committee for the Northeast Anti-Japanese General Association was established as its full Manchurian governing body. The subordinate organs of the preparatory committee of the Northeast Anti-Japanese General Association include the South Manchuria Anti-Japanese General Association (established in August 1934), the East Manchuria Anti-Japanese General Association (destroyed), the Harbin-East Anti-Japanese General Association, the Ji-East Anti-Japanese General Association, the Raohe Anti-Japanese General Association (established in June 1932), and the Tangyuan Anti-Japanese General Association (established at the end of 1935), etc., which are currently the most powerful mass organizations in Manchuria.

　　In the development of the Anti-Japanese United Army, the South Manchurian and Harbin-East guerrilla areas have repeatedly tried to organize a common anti-Japanese united front with the People's Revolutionary Army as the center, but each time they failed. However, since the Chinese Communist Party, based on the "August 1st Declaration," advocated the establishment of a national defense government and an anti-Japanese united army to launch an anti-Japanese people's front movement in China, it has been well-influenced. It is precisely these two previously unsuccessful guerrilla areas that have truly expanded and consolidated the united front movement. (1) In September 1935, the South Manchurian guerrilla area, with the Second Independent Division of the First Army of the People's Revolutionary Army as the center, gathered 24 anti-Japanese "bandit" units, resulting in the establishment of the Jiangbei General Headquarters of the Anti-Japanese United Army. (2) In October of the same year, the "bandit" leaders of seven anti-Japanese "bandit" units of the Northeast Volunteer Army in South Manchuria jointly advocated organizing the South Manchuria Anti-Japanese United Army with Yang Jingyu as the army commander. (3) Subsequently, in the name of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, the army commanders of the First Army, Yang Jingyu, to the Sixth Army, and Wu Yicheng, the commander-in-chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army, Kong Xianrong, the deputy commander-in-chief, and the Tangyuan and Hailun Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachments jointly issued a statement supporting the "August 1st Declaration." (4) Thus, Wang Fengge, the "bandit" leader of the South Manchurian political "bandit" center, who was at odds with the First Army and exchanged fire with it, also joined the anti-Japanese people's front movement, cooperated with the First Army, and carried out joint operations. The Korean Revolutionary Army also actively participated. (5) As for the Harbin-East guerrilla area, there was also a epoch-making development. In late January 1936, an "Enlarged Military and Political Conference of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army" was held in Tangyuan County. Zhao Shangzhi, Li Yanlu, Zhang Shoujian, Feng Zhigang, and other famous "Communist bandits" and "political bandits" in North Manchuria all attended. The main issues decided at the meeting were the establishment of the "Provisional Government of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese United Army" and the establishment and expansion of the organization of the "Northeast People's Anti-Japanese United Army." As a result, in the North Manchurian region, where "political bandits" were particularly active, the past dispersed and confrontational relations were quickly cleared, and they were all incorporated under the command of the General Headquarters of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. The Sixth Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army (Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army) was established (February 1936 in Tangyuan County), the Eighth Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established (around March 1936 in Wuchang County), and the Ninth Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was established (around May and June 1936 in Junlan County). (6) In the Jilin guerrilla area, the Second Division of the Second Army and the Fifth Army of the People's Revolutionary Army merged to form the Anti-Japanese United Army Second and Fifth Armies under the command of Zhou Baozhong. They absorbed more anti-Japanese "bandit" units and divided into three directions: the East Line troops, the × Line troops, and the West Line troops, to strive to open up new guerrilla areas and establish contact points with the First and Third Armies.

　　II. East Manchuria
　　The establishment of the Fifth Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army: After the dissolution of the Jidong Bureau in 1934, Zhou Baozhong, the military commissioner of the bureau, served as the director of the military department of the Suining County Party Committee and organized an anti-Japanese guerrilla detachment of about 100 people. Subsequently, due to the assistance of dozens of outstanding members of the Second Army of the People's Revolutionary Army and cooperation with the Northeast Volunteer Army to establish an office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, the guerrilla detachment under Zhou Baozhong's leadership gradually strengthened until February 20, Showa 11 (1936), when the Ning'an Anti-Japanese Allied Army and the Ning'an Anti-Japanese United Army office were dissolved, and the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army Fifth Army was established with the Badao Hezi area of Ning'an County as its base. (Editor's note: When the army was reorganized, it issued a declaration clarifying the army's mission, the first of which clearly stipulated: "To overthrow the Japanese imperialist bandits, overthrow the running dog Manchukuo, restore Chinese territory, and build an independent and free Chinese people's regime.") (The full text of the declaration is omitted)

　　The establishment of the Second Army of the People's Revolutionary Army was around March of Showa 9 (1934). Prior to this, the armed activities of the Jian Dao "Communist bandits" were carried out by self-defense organizations such as guerrilla detachments and self-defense teams of peasant groups under the leadership of the former East Manchuria Special Committee of the Manchuria ××. These armed forces greatly increased their strength by gathering bankrupt farmers in the chaotic period after the Manchurian Incident and absorbing escaped soldiers. Under the leadership of the Military Commission of the East Manchuria Special Committee, they gradually possessed the substance of an army. Around June of Showa 8, the East Manchuria Special Committee determined a new policy, deciding to reorganize the past armed forces into the People's Revolutionary Army, and to organize the guerrilla armed forces organized by various counties into a unified organization and compile them into the People's Revolutionary Army... In March of Showa 9, Wang Detai, the head of the Military Department of the East Manchuria Special Committee, Li Xiangmo, the head of the Organization Department of the Special Committee, and 15 leaders of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment, the Anti-Japanese Army leader, etc., gathered on the summit of Nengzhiying Mountain in Sandao Wei, Yanji County, and combined the guerrilla detachments and volunteer army units under the leadership of the former Special Committee to form the First Independent Division of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army Second Army... Then, on May 30, Showa 9, in Dahuangwei, Yanji County, a part of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Detachment, the Anti-Japanese members, and the anti-Manchu "bandits" in Wangqing County were gathered to form the Second Independent Division, which operated in Wangqing and Hunchun counties...

　　Where do weapons and ammunition come from? The equipment of the Second Army of the People's Revolutionary Army (Anti-Japanese United Army) seems to be quite substantial. Then, where do all their weapons and ammunition come from? According to information obtained, there are probably three ways to obtain ammunition: (1) Obtained through violent means such as raids, looting, and disarmament; (2) Obtained through "Communist bandit" sympathizers; (3) Manufactured by the "Communist bandits" themselves. (The original Japanese note gives examples here, which are omitted)

　　III. South Manchuria
　　The establishment of the First Army of the People's Revolutionary Army: Under the leadership of the Panshi Central County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Manchuria Provincial Committee, in view of the constant clearing by the Japanese and Manchukuo armies after the Manchurian Incident, for self-defense, the Party established a military department within the Party in the spring of Showa 7 (1932), and under its leadership, guerrilla detachments were established. On the other hand, the peasant associations, mass struggle organizations in rural areas, also organized armed self-defense groups, the Red Guards, and gave them military training. At the beginning of their establishment, these armed groups were very weak in both quality and quantity. However, like Zhuhe, the rebellion of the Bing "bandits" (Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, Manchu troops who defected), the uprising of the Big Sword Society, and the Red Spear Society became a condition for them to gain mass support and begin to carry out powerful military actions... Then, in September of Showa 7, Song Guorong, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the 13th Regiment of the Fifth Brigade of the Manchu Army, mutinied. Song's 370 men and other Manchu army units, the National Salvation Army, the Red Spear Society, and "bandits" joined forces to attack Panshi County and occupied it... Therefore, the Panshi Central County Committee gathered the defeated soldiers and bandits, the teachers and students of Panshi Middle School who participated in the attack, and the workers of the Ji-Hai Railway, etc., and reorganized the former Peasant and Worker Volunteer Army into the South Manchuria Guerrilla Detachment of the 32nd Army of the Chinese Red Army. On the other hand, the Red Army Guerrilla Detachment merged with the Big Sword Society "bandits" in Jinchuan County and the National Salvation Army operating in Tonghua and Liuhe counties. Its influence gradually expanded, and soldiers continued to mutiny and join the Red Army.

　　Therefore, on September 18, Showa 8 (1933), the leaders of the Red Army units held a joint meeting in Bolihe Tao, Panshi County, and established the First Independent Division of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army First Army; the commander-in-chief was Yang Jingyu (said to have both talent and ability and is a capable general), with sixteen units and 720 soldiers. Other bandit groups of about 1,000 men were under his influence... By March of Showa 9, the People's Revolutionary Army, which moved south, organized the General Headquarters of the Anti-Japanese United Army in order to unite other "bandit groups" and consolidate the anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese front, and seized its actual power. It took Qingyuan, Liuhe, and Jinchuan counties as guerrilla areas and launched active activities. After the People's Revolutionary Army moved south, the remaining troops, the "First Regiment," organized two platoons of the Youth Volunteer Army, a total of about 100 men, in January of Showa 9. Furthermore, in May of the same year, they agreed with other "bandit groups" in Yitong County to organize the Jiangbei General Headquarters of the Anti-Japanese United Army.

　　The strength of the People's Revolutionary Army gradually increased. On November 5, Showa 9 (1934), the First South Manchuria Congress was held on the border of Huinan and Mengjiang counties. The meeting decided to restore the South Manchuria Special Committee and organize the Provisional South Manchuria Special Committee and the Second Independent Division of the First Army of the Northeast People's Revolutionary Army. The Second Division, centered on Panshi... finally acquired a solid base in Huinan and Mengjiang in August of Showa 10... On the other hand, the First Division under the leadership of the Tonghua Central County Committee cooperated with the Second Division's actions and established bases in Tonghua, Xingjing, and Liuhe... As a result, regardless of the large-scale campaigns in autumn and winter and the decline of "bandit group" activities in winter, the number of "Communist bandits" in the Eastern Border Road increased significantly...

　　The discipline of the People's Revolutionary Army: The People's Revolutionary Army is orderly in everything. Its attitude towards the people is as follows: (1) Those who unreasonably beat the masses will be kept in the team on probation or expelled depending on the circumstances (the first rule of mass discipline); (2) Those who unreasonably insult the masses will be given a serious warning or kept in the team on probation depending on the circumstances (same as the first rule); (3) Those who molest civilian women will be given a serious warning or expelled depending on the circumstances (same as the sixth rule); (4) Those who rape women will be shot (same as the fifth rule); (5) Those who take the opportunity to rob the people of their property without military orders will be expelled (same as the third rule); (6) Those who kill and set fires without military orders will be expelled or shot depending on the circumstances (same as the fourth rule). The People's Revolutionary Army exists on the basis of the red masses, so it pays great attention to mass relations and strictly prohibits soldiers from acting arbitrarily... "The activities of the Red Army are completely different from those of bandits. When resting in people's homes during marches, they always pay for the meals they eat, and they always pay for the items they take away. If they don't have money at the time, they will definitely send it later." (Tonghua Police Bureau) "...When camping, they let the farmers, old and young, sleep on the kang (heated brick bed), while they sleep on the ground; if they ask the farmers to do things, they give them considerable remuneration." (Military Control Area) The People's Revolutionary Army's strict military discipline and mass attitude promote the harmony of emotions with the people and strengthen the combination of the two.

　　Peasant Committee: In the Panshi area, as in the Jiandao area, the peasant movement was carried out by peasant associations and has always been active. Later, the peasant associations were replaced by peasant committees. The peasant associations were originally organizations of poor peasants, and their power to mobilize the masses in the struggle against imperialism was far inferior to that of the peasant committees, which included middle peasants. The peasant committee focuses on the following slogans: (1) Peasants get 80% of the autumn harvest. (2) Refuse to pay taxes to Japanese imperialism and the Manchukuo government. (3) Oppose the killing of peasants by Japanese imperialism and the Manchukuo government... The peasant committee absorbed a wide range of peasants and established the leadership of farm laborers and poor peasants within it to prepare the foundation for a revolutionary regime.

　　Anti-Japanese Association: In the Panshi area, shortly after the Manchurian Incident (spring of 1932), it took advantage of the rise of anti-Japanese sentiment and combined with anti-Japanese elements to organize the Panshi Anti-Japanese Alliance... On August 20, 1934, a representative conference was held in Panshi, which decided on the program of the anti-Japanese struggle and the charter of the Anti-Japanese General Association, and established the South Manchuria Anti-Japanese General Association (elected nine members), and thus, with a new look, began organized and active activities. According to the charter of the South Manchuria Anti-Japanese General Association, its jurisdiction covers Panshi, Shuangyang, Huadian, Hui, Mengjiang, Jinchuan, Hailong... the entire South Manchuria north of the Anfeng Line... The targets of organization are workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Revolutionary Army and the Anti-Japanese Army, anti-Japanese officers, as well as disaster victims, students, teachers, merchants, Manchukuo soldiers, and all working people... The mission of the Anti-Japanese Association is to achieve the goal of anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese through propaganda, mass enlightenment movements against Manchu and anti-Japanese, material assistance to the Red Army, replenishment of Red Army soldiers, and collecting intelligence on the Japanese and Manchukuo military police. The Anti-Japanese Association is different from the organs of class struggle, but a special mass mobilization organ for national struggle. Therefore, in order to absorb the anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese masses as widely as possible, gender, ethnicity, not to mention class differences, do not become a problem...

　　The strategy of the mass movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's Manchuria Provincial Committee has always been to establish an anti-Japanese people's front, and "according to the August 1st Declaration," the main goal of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle is also placed on the anti-Japanese movement. The political weight of the Anti-Japanese Association in the mass mobilization organs they organize is increasing day by day. Currently, under the name of anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese, the power of mobilizing the masses is rising.

　　日人口中的
    东北抗日联军和中共
    编者按：本篇材料系从伪满洲国军政部顾问部所编《满洲共匪之研究》一书中摘译编辑而成。从这些敌伪口中所说的材料中，可以看出中国共产党和东北抗日联军于“九一八”后，是如何的领导东北人民积极进行反满抗日斗争。文中标题为编者所加。该书于一九三六年出版，上有“极密”字样。
    一、概观
    党部和武装及抗日会的建立（编者按党部一项从略）
    人民革命军成立的经过如下：
    （一）南满游击区东北人民革命军第一军第一独立师一九三三年八月成立（以过去红军第三二军南满游击队为中心改编的）；第二独立师一九三四年十一月成立。
    （二）东满游击区东北人民革命军第二军第一独立师一九三四年三月成立；第二军第二师一九三四年五月成立。
    （三）哈东游击区珠河红色游击队一九三三年夏成立；东北人民革命军第三军第一独立师一九三五年一月成立（以珠河红色游击队为基础）。
    （四）绥宁及密饶地区宁安抗日游击队一九三四年四月成立；饶河抗日游击队一九三三年七月成立；密山红色游击队一九三三年十二月成立；东北抗日联军第四军一九三五年二月成立（以饶河密山游击队为基础）；该联军第五军一九三五年二月成立（以宁安抗日游击队为基础）。
    （五）汤原游击区汤原抗日游击队一九三三年底成立；东北抗日联军第六军一九三五年六月成立（以谢文东“匪”为基础）。
    （六）海伦游击区海伦红色游击队。
    满洲事变后，所有反帝同盟均改为抗日会。至一九三五年春，遂设立东北抗日总会筹备会，为其全满的统治机关。东北抗日总会筹备会下级机关有南满抗日总会（一九三四年八月成立）、东满抗日总会（已破坏）、哈东抗日总会、吉东抗日总会、饶河抗日总会（一九三二年六月成立）、汤原抗日总会（一九三五年底成立）等，为现在满洲最有力的群众团体。
    抗日联军的发展上，南满和哈东两游击区过去屡试以人民革命军为中心而组织抗日共同战线，每次均归失败，但自中国共产党根据“八一宣言”提倡国防政府和抗日联军在中国展开抗日人民战线运动以来，受了良好的影响，并真正扩大和巩固了联合战线运动的正是这两个过去不行的游击区。（１）南满游击区于一九三五年九月以人民革命军第一军第二独立师为中心纠集二十四个抗日“匪”部队，遂产生了抗日联军江北总指挥部。（２）同年十月，南满东北义勇军系七个抗日“匪”部队的“匪”首联名倡议组织以杨靖宇为军长的南满抗日联军。（３）随后以东北抗日联军的名义由第一军军长杨靖宇以至第六军各军长及东北义勇军总司令吴义成，副总司令孔宪荣，汤原和海伦抗日游击队联名发表了支持“八一宣言”的声明。（４）于是从此与第一军势不两立，而以炮火相见的南满政治“匪”中心“匪”首王凤阁也与抗日人民战线运动合流，与第一军互相提携，实行联合作战，朝鲜革命军也积极参加。（５）至于哈东游击区也有划时期的发展。一九三六年一月下旬，于汤原县召开了“东北抗日联军军政扩大会”，赵尚志、李延禄、张寿ｊｉāｎ＠①、冯治纲等北满有名的“共匪”和“政治匪”均往参加，会议上决定的主要事项是树立“东北人民抗日联军临时政府”和确立与扩大“东北人民抗日联军”的组织问题。于是在“政治匪”特别活跃的北满地区，迅速的清算了过去分散对立的关系，统编于东北抗日联军总司令部指挥之下。东北人民革命军（东北抗日联军）第六军成立（一九三六年二月于汤原县）、东北抗日联军第八军成立（一九三六年三月前后于五常县）、东北抗日联军第九军成立（一九三六年五六月间于均兰县）。（６）在吉林游击区人民革命军第二军第二师和第五军合流，编成以周保中为总指挥的抗日联军第二、五军，吸收更多抗日“匪”部，分成东线部队、×线部队、西线部队三个方向，为开辟新游击区和确立与第一军及第三军的连络点而奋斗。
    二、东满方面
    抗联第五军的成立，吉东局军事委员长周保中于一九三四年该局解散后，担任绥宁县委军事部主任，组织了约有一百名的抗日游击队。此后，因人民革命军第二军中优秀分子数十名来援，以及与东北义勇军合作而设立东北抗日联军办事处，周保中领导下的游击队乃逐渐强化至昭和十一年（一九三六年）二月二十日，解散宁安抗日同盟军和宁安抗日联军办事处，成立了以宁安县八道合子方面为根据地的东北抗日联军第五军。（编者按：该军改编时，曾发表宣言，阐明该军之任务，第一条即明确规定：专以打倒日本帝国主义强盗，推翻走狗满洲国，恢复中国领土，建设独立自由的中国人民政权为目的。）（宣言全文从略）
    人民革命军第二军的成立是昭和九年（一九三四年）三月左右的事。在此以前，间岛“共匪”的武装活动，是由满洲××前东满特委领导下的农民团体之自卫组织游击队、自卫队等进行的。这些武装队伍，由于纠集了满洲事变后混乱期的破产农民，吸收了逃走的士兵，其实力大增。在东满特委军事委员会领导之下，逐渐具备了军队的实质。昭和八年六月左右，东满特委确定了新方针，决定将过去的武装军队改编成立人民革命军，将各县组织的指挥领导不统一的游击武装队伍，编为一个统一的组织，编为人民革命军……。昭和九年三月，东满特委军事部负责人王德泰，特委组织部负责人李相默，抗日游击队首脑部抗日军领袖等十五名，于延吉县三道崴能芝营山顶上集合，纠合过去特委领导下的游击队及义勇军系各“匪”，合编成了东北人民革命军第二军第一独立师……。接着昭和九年五月三十日，在延吉县大荒崴，集合汪清县内的抗日游击队、抗日会员反满“匪”之一部组成第二独立师，活动于汪清、珲春两县境内……。
    武器弹药从何而来？人民革命军（抗日联军）第二军的装备似乎相当充实，然则彼等所有之武器弹药究从何而来，根据情报所得消息，弹药入手之方法大概有三：（一）以袭击抢夺缴械等暴力手段获得者；（二）通过通“匪”分子取得者；（三）、“共匪”自己制造。（日注原文下举实例此处从略）
    三、南满方面
    人民革命军第一军的成立，在中共满洲省委领导下的磐石中心县委鉴于满洲事变后日满军不断的清剿，为自卫计，党遂于昭和七年（一九三二）春于党内设立了军事部，在其领导下成立了游击队。另一方面，在农村中的群众斗争团体农民协会也组织了武装自卫团体赤卫队，施以军事训练。成立当初，这些武装团体，在质量上和数量上都是非常微弱的。但和珠河地方一样，兵“匪”（东北抗日救国军、满洲叛变的军队）的叛乱、大刀会、红枪会的蜂起，成为其能够获得群众性开始有力的军事行动的一个条件……。接着昭和七年九月，满军第五旅第十三团第一营长宋国荣哗变，宋部三百七十名和其他满军部队、救国军、红枪会、“土匪”等合流，袭击磐石县，并占领之……。于是磐石中心县委并将残兵败匪参加袭击的磐石中学教员学生、吉海铁路工人等集合起来，改编过去的农工义勇军为中国红军第三十二军南满游击队。另一方面，红军游击队和金川县内的大刀会“匪”、通化、柳河全县内行动的救国军合流，其影响渐次扩大，不断发生士兵叛变参加红军的事情。
    于是昭和八年（一九三三年）九一八，红军部队首领于磐石县玻璃河套召开联席会议，成立了东北人民革命军第一军第一独立师；总司令为杨靖宇（据传才能器量兼而有之，不失为将才），拥有十六个部队七百二十名兵力，其他匪团约一千名在其影响之下……。至昭和九年三月，南下的人民革命军，为着结合其他“匪团”，巩固反满抗日战线，便组织了抗日联军总指挥部，并掌握其实权，以清原、柳河、金川各县为游击地带，展开了积极的活动。人民革命军南迁后，留下的部队“第一团”，于昭和九年一月组织了青年义勇军两个中队，共约百名。更于同年五月，与伊通县其他“匪团”协议，组织了江北抗日联军总指挥部。
    人民革命军的势力逐渐增长，昭和九年（一九三四年）十一月五日，在辉南、蒙江县边境召开第一次南满代表大会，会议决定恢复南满特委，组织临时南满特委和东北人民革命军第一军第二独立师。以磐石为中心的第二师……终于昭和十年八月取得辉南、蒙江地方巩固的根据地……。另一方面，通化中心县委领导下的第一师，配合二师行动，在通化、兴京、柳河方面建立根据地……。于是不管秋冬季的大讨伐，和冬季“匪团”活动的衰退等等，东边道的“共匪”数量却有显著的增加……。
    人民革命军的纪律：人民革命军无论什么都是秩序井然，其对民众的态度如下：（一）无理殴打群众者，酌情留队察看或除名（群众纪律第一条）；（二）无理辱骂群众者，酌情严重警告或留队察看（同第一条）；（三）调戏民间妇女者，酌情严重警告或除名（同第六条）；（四）强奸妇女者，枪决（同第五条）；（五）无军令乘机抢劫群众财物者，开除（同第三条）；（六）无军令杀人放火者，视情况轻重开除或枪决之（同第四条）。人民革命军，依靠红色群众为基础始得存在，因此非常注意群众关系，严禁士兵恣意行动……。“红军的活动完全和土匪不同，行军中在民家休息所吃伙食一定付钱，带走物品必照价偿付，如果当时未带钱，日后一定送来。”（通化警局）“……宿营时，让农民老幼睡在炕上，自己则睡在地下；若使农民作事时，有相当报酬。”（军管区）人民革命军这种军纪严肃的群众态度，促进和民众感情融洽，加强了两者的结合。
    农民委员会：磐石地方和间岛地方一样，农民运动由农民协会进行，向来活跃。后来农民协会遂为农民委员会代替，农民协会本来是贫农的组合，在对帝国主义斗争上动员群众的力量，远不如包含中农在内的农民委员会。农民委员会以如下口号为中心：（一）秋收八成归农民。（二）拒缴日本帝国主义、满洲国政府的捐税。（三）反对日本帝国主义、满洲国政府屠杀农民……。农民委员会吸收了广泛的农民群众，在其内部确立雇农、贫农的领导权，以准备革命政权的基础。
    抗日会：磐石地方于满洲事变后不久（一九三二年春）即乘着抗日情绪的高涨与抗日分子结合起来，组织了磐石抗日同盟……。一九三四年八月二十日，在磐石召开了代表大会，决定了抗日斗争的纲领和抗日总会章程，成立了南满抗日总会（选出九名委员），于是面目一新，开始了有组织的积极活动。根据南满抗日总会的章程，其管辖区域为磐石、双阳、桦甸、辉、蒙江、金川、海龙……安奉线以北，南满全境……组织对象为工人、农民、人民革命军和抗日军士兵抗日军官，以及灾民、学生、教员、商人、满洲国士兵等一切劳苦大众……。抗日会的使命，通过宣传反满抗日的群众启蒙运动，红军的物质援助红军士兵之补充，搜集日满军警之情报等等活动，达到反满抗日之目的。抗日会和阶级斗争的机关不同，而是为了民族斗争的特殊的群众动员机关。因此，为了尽量广泛吸收反满抗日群众，性别、民族不用说，即阶级的差异也不成其为问题了……。
    中共满洲省委领导下的群众运动的战略，向来就是确定抗日人民战线，而且“根据八一宣言”中国共产党的斗争主要目标也放在抗日运动上面，他们所组织的群众动员机关当中抗日会的政治比重，遂日益增大起来。目前在反满抗日名义之下，动员群众的力量正在高涨当中。
