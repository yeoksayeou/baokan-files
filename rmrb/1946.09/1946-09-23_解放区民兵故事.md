    The fishermen's joint defense team in Weishan Lake in southwestern Shandong are all good at swimming and shooting. They set up gun boats (small boats) and are as agile as flying. They are used to using duck guns without sights. When the trigger is pulled, they hit the target automatically. On August 23, Liu Debang led the joint defense team in a boat raid, attempting to cross the Jiang army's sailboat secretly. One shot hit the sail, and the sailboat stopped. Liu Debang used a pole to support himself and jumped onto the Jiang army's boat, capturing the "Homecoming Corps" township head and secretary alive. Then he plunged into the lake and returned in triumph.

    Liu Huanan, the traitorous commander of the First Regiment of the Second Division of the puppet army, with more than 600 men entrenched in the Jiang army's strongholds of Nan Da Ran and Bei Da Ran near Baoding, went to surround the village of Xisanlinshui at dawn on August 23. The puppet army thought the villagers were fast asleep and could be robbed and killed at will. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by the militiamen hidden on the fort walls. The militiamen waited for the puppet troops to enter close range and suddenly fired a volley of guns. The puppet troops were caught off guard and seven or eight of them were knocked down. The rest scattered like a flock of startled birds. Another group of puppet troops crawled towards the south gate of the fort. As soon as they stood up, Liu Yuanxiang, the deputy leader of the militia team lurking in the gate, shouted loudly and waved his hand. A large landmine tied to a tree exploded, and four puppet soldiers were blown into the sky. Militiamen from all the villages came to support them upon hearing the alarm. The puppet troops abandoned more than 40 corpses and fled back to their tortoise shells in Nan Da Ran and Bei Da Ran.

    At the end of August, the Jiang army at Dingxing Station on the Pinghan Railway, together with more than 2,000 men of the puppet Wang Fenggang's troops, raided the seat of the local democratic government in Nan Beipu Village. The militiamen in the surrounding areas had received intelligence in advance and used unpredictable sniper warfare to intercept them from the boundless green gauze tents along the way. The Jiang and puppet troops abandoned their wounded and rushed towards Nan Beipu Village. But they found nothing, the village was deserted. The Jiang and puppet troops fired a volley of guns and cannons and were about to turn back when a burst of gunfire flew from a tall building. The Jiang and puppet troops scattered in panic, surrounded the high building, and shouted: "Surrender! You are surrounded!" They shouted for a long time, but no one answered. The puppet troops cautiously went in to search and found that the militiamen had already moved away through the tunnel.

    鲁西南微山湖中的渔民联防队，个个善泅善射，架起枪溜子（小船）轻捷如飞，惯用无瞄准器的鸭枪，板机一动，自发命中。八月二十三日，刘德邦率联防队架舟奔袭，企图偷渡的蒋军帆船，一枪打下风蓬，帆船停住，刘德邦用槁一撑，跳登蒋军船上，活捉“还乡团”乡长和书记后，扑通往湖里一钻，凯旋归来。

    盘踞于保定南北大冉据点的刘逆化南伪第二师第一团六百余人，于八月二十三日拂晓去包围西三林水村，该伪以为村民酣睡未醒，可任意抢杀，没想到旱被隐蔽在堡墙上民兵发觉，民兵们等伪军进入近距离内，突然一齐放排枪，伪军猝不及防，被撩倒七八个，其余象一群惊鸟，纷乱逃散，另股伪军向南堡门匍匐前进，刚一站出来，潜伏在门里的民兵队副刘苑祥大喝一声，把手一扬，一颗绑在树上的大地雷应声开了花，四名伪军被炸得飞上半天空，各村民兵闻警来援，伪军遗尸四十余具逃回南北大冉的乌龟壳。
            （三）
    八月底平汉路上定兴车站的蒋军纠合伪王逆凤岗部两千余人，奔袭当地民主政府驻地南北葡村，附近各地民兵事先得到情报，以神出鬼没的冷枪战，从沿途漫无边际的青纱帐里阻击，蒋伪军遗弃伤兵，夺路向南北葡村硬冲，可是扑了个空，村中杳无人影，蒋伪乱放了一顿枪炮正准备往回转时，一座高楼里却飞来了一阵排枪弹，蒋伪军慌张的散开，包围高楼，并高喊：“缴枪吧！你们被包围了”。喊了好久，没人答应，伪军提心吊胆，进去搜索才发现民兵早已从地道转移了。
