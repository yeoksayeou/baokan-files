Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: The Chiang Kai-shek government has recently sold China's aluminum mines, electricity, electrical appliances, steel smelting, and other industries to the United States. According to the Minzhu Bao on the 11th of last month, a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on August 8th stated: The American Reynolds Metals Company announced their "cooperation" plan at the beginning of last month. According to this plan, they will use Japanese aluminum plants formerly in the Northeast and Taiwan, as well as Chinese bauxite or high-grade bauxite produced in Dutch Guiana in South America, to smelt aluminum and expand equipment. The American side will be responsible for capital and technology. It is reported that the company's interests in China are represented by Xu Shilian, former sociology professor at Yenching University and economic advisor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Furthermore, according to the Tianjin Dagong Bao on August 28th: In addition to the aforementioned mines, electricity, electrical appliances, steel smelting, and other industries are also being operated by foreign "capital," "talent," and "materials" under the so-called principle of "assistance." The National Government's Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan signed contracts with the United States and Canada.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: Shanghai Report: Imports of foreign goods are flourishing, far exceeding exports. According to a Central News Agency report: Statistics released here on the 3rd showed that a total of 830 merchant ships, totaling more than 135,000 tons, entered and exited ports in August. Exports totaled 94,869 quintals, while imports totaled 249,000 quintals, of which foreign goods accounted for 3.3 million kilograms and 100,054 quintals.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 11th: The national humiliating contract between the Kuomintang government to supply Haizhou and Jinzhou phosphate production to Japan has been signed with MacArthur. The first batch of phosphate rock began shipping in early July, transported by five special trains daily, approximately 3,600 tons. The second batch began shipping on the painful anniversary of the Japanese invasion of China—"August 13th."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: Nanjing Report: Regarding the Kuomintang authorities' move to raise the exchange rate on the 19th of last month, pessimistic and critical opinions have been voiced here, considering this a "suicidal policy" by the Kuomintang authorities. The Dagang Bao believes that this "cannot avoid an economic crisis" but rather deepens it. Even the Central Daily News had to admit that if prices are unstable, adjusting the exchange rate "will still not help national industry." Public opinion unanimously believes that the economic crisis cannot be overcome due to the civil war and the resulting aggravated inflation. Even the semi-official Shanghai Dagong Bao had to say that "it would be better if the legal tender were no longer issued." Shanghai business leaders stated: "War and production cannot coexist. The efforts of the business community for several months may be destroyed by one shot. We really need peace."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: Kunming Report: The Yunnan branch of the Industrial Cooperative Association invited relevant agencies and groups to hold a discussion meeting on supporting domestic goods on the 16th of last month. A committee was immediately organized to be responsible for promoting the work and resolved to call on the industrial sector to improve quality and to request the National Government to quickly reduce taxes on light industry, encourage production, and assist rear-area industries to compete with American goods.

　　蒋介石危害国家主权
    出卖矿产工业
    南京舆论抨击当局提高美汇
    【新华社延安十一日电】蒋介石政府近将中国之铝矿、电力、电器、炼钢等事业出卖给美国。据上月十一日民主报载中央社纽约八月八日电：美雷诺金属公司已于上月初宣布他们的“合作”计划，依此计划，以日本原在东北及台湾之铝矿厂及我国之铁矾土或南美荷属圭亚挪所产之高度铁矾土从事炼铝，并扩充设备。资本与技术方面皆由美方负责。该公司在华利益闻由前燕京大学社会学教授及经济部参事许士廉代表。又据八月二十八日天津大公报载：除上述矿外，尚有电力、电器、炼钢等事业，亦均在此所谓“帮助”的原则下，由国民党政府行政院资委会与美国及加拿大签订合同，由外国的“财”“才”“材”经营。
    【新华社延安十一日电】沪讯：洋货进口至盛，远超过出口。据中央社讯：三日此间发表统计：八月份全月进出口商轮共八百三十艘，约十三万五千余吨，出口计九万四千八百六十九公担，进口为二十四万九千公担，其中洋货占三百三十万公斤又十万零五十四公担。
    【新华社南京十一日电】国民党政府以海州、锦州之磷产供给日本的辱国契约，已与麦克阿瑟签订。其首批磷块开始于七月初起运，每日以五节专车运出，约三千六百吨。其第二批并已于日寇侵略中国的沉痛纪念日——“八一三”开始起运。
    【新华社延安九日电】南京讯：关于上月十九日国民党当局实行提高汇率一举，此间一直发出悲观与抨击的舆论，认为这是国民党当局的“自杀政策”。大刚报认为这“不能避免经济危机”，而是加深危机之举。甚至中央日报也不得不承认物价不稳定，则调整外汇“对于民族工业仍无补于事”。舆论一致认为经济危机之无法克服，乃由于内战及因此而加剧了的通货膨胀。半官方的上海大公报也不得不说要“法币不再增发才好”。上海工商界领袖们表示：“战争与生产不能共存。工商界数月之努力，可能被一炮摧毁，我们实在需要和平。”
    【新华社延安十一日电】昆明讯：此间工协云南分会于上月十六日邀请有关机关团体举行爱用国货讨论会，当即组织一委员会负责推动工作，并决议呼吁工业界改良品质，及呈请国民政府迅速减速轻工业捐税，鼓励生产，救济后方工业，以与美货竞争。
