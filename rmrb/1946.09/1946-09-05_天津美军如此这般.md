Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: The Shanghai Wenhui Daily published an article on August 13th entitled "The American Military in Tianjin Acting Like This," detailing the various ways in which American soldiers humiliate the Chinese people. The reporter stated: American soldiers in Tianjin often throw paper balls or firecrackers onto the sidewalks, hoping to hit female students and young women hurrying to school or home, and then laugh heartily, their laughter filled with pride and satisfaction.

The famous dance halls in Tianjin, such as "Huizhong," "International," and "World," are places where American soldiers can "do as they please." They can use "chivalrous" "bravery" to force young women and ladies who participate in dancing but do not want to take things further into a rendezvous. If the other party firmly refuses, they often use their burly physique to forcibly drag or pull them away.

The reporter said: Beining Park, nine miles from the city center, is a "hunting ground" for American soldiers. They can freely harass young women and can also take candy from vendors without paying. As for taking full or partial pictures of girls with cameras, it is their "proud masterpiece."

The police not only do not interfere with these behaviors of the American soldiers, but often help them speak or admire their "naive performances" with envious expressions, letting them beat rickshaw drivers until their heads are bleeding, letting them rush around and fire guns to scare people. At night, the citizens of Tianjin are often awakened by gunshots, sometimes dozens of times a night. As recently as twelve o'clock on the night of August 4th, there were two incidents of American soldiers shooting and injuring police officers, and they also shot and wounded a passerby.

What the citizens of Tianjin hate most is the increasing number of American soldiers and their constant so-called "large-scale exercises" that threaten the safety of the Chinese people. Exercises are held once every Friday. New weapons such as motorcycles, automatic machine guns, and cannons are often transported from American soldier Battalion A to Battalion B. In particular, huge military transport trucks are constantly running on the streets, and no one knows what is loaded inside or where they are going, only bringing the fear of war.

The reporter of the newspaper said: "The Tianjin people's comment on the Anping Incident is 'one hand cannot clap.' If the American soldiers go back, the Communist army will never rush to Washington, not to mention that their parents and brothers are also looking forward to their return!

When the citizens of Tianjin see American soldiers, an uneasy look immediately appears on their faces, especially at night, they walk in the streets in a way to avoid them. As for the women, they have reduced their visits to parks and other public places in the past two days, fearing that misfortune will fall on them. Yesterday (the 4th) at the French vegetable market, two American soldiers snatched a pair of pillows from a grocery stall, but the vendors did not pursue them, also because they were afraid of suffering great harm because of trivial matters.

Currently, in Tianjin, people everywhere are asking, "When will the American soldiers withdraw?"

### 天津美军如此这般

　　天津美军如此这般
    【新华社延安二日电】沪文汇报八月十三日揭载“天津美军如此这般”一文，详述美军种种凌辱中国人民的情景，该记者说：天津美军常常用纸球或鞭炮掷向行人道上，希望命中那些上学或下学归家急走的女学生和少妇，就纵情大笑，笑声中带着骄傲和满足。
    天津著名的舞厅里，如“惠中”、“国际”、“世界”是美军们“畅所欲为”的地方，他们可以用“骑士式”的“英勇”强迫那些参加跳舞而不愿作进一步事情的少妇小姐们来一次欢会，遇到对方坚拒，往往便利用他们魁壮的体格实行硬拖或强拉。
    记者称：距市中心九华里的北宁公园，是美军的“狩猎场所”，他们可以尽情的调戏青年妇女，也可以不给钱拿去小贩们的糖果，至于用照相机摄取女孩子们全面或半面像更是他们的“得意杰作”。
    美军的这种行为，警察们不但不去干涉，反常常帮着他们说话，或带着羡慕的表情欣赏着他们的“天真表演”，让他们把三轮车夫打得头破血流，让他们横冲直撞鸣枪吓人。夜间天津市民常常被枪声惊醒，有时一夜达数十次以上，就在八月四日夜十二时，有二件美军枪杀及殴伤警察的事情，还枪伤了一个路人。
    最使天津市民憎恨的是美军日渐的增多，并以不断的进行着威胁中国人民安全的所谓“大演习”。每星期五要举行演习一次，摩托车、自动机关枪，战炮等新式武器，常常由美军甲兵营运送到乙兵营去，特别是巨型军运卡车老是川流不息的在街上驰骋，里面装着什么驶到什么地方谁也不知道，只带来了战争的恐惧。
    该报记者说：“天津人对于安平事件的评论是“一个手拍不响”，要是美军回去了，中共军决不会赶到华盛顿去的，何况他们的父母兄弟也是正盼望他们回去呵！
    天津的市民们看见美军时，面上立时现出不安的神色，特别在晚间，他们是以躲避的方式行走在各个街道上。至于女子们近两日已减少往公园与其它公共场所，生怕横祸冲在自己身上。法国菜市昨天（四日）有两个美军抢去杂货摊枕头一对，可是小贩也不追索，原因也是恐怕因小事而受大害。
    目前的天津市，到处都碰到人们在询问着“美军何时撤退呵”？
