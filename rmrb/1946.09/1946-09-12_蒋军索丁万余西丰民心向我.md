Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th. After the city of Xifeng County, Liaobei, was occupied by Chiang's troops on May 11th, one day, Liu Xiao Hu Zi, a Chiang soldier in Xifeng city, led his cavalry out to plunder. He grabbed an old man and asked, "Are the Eighth Route Army good? Is the Central Army good?" The old man hated the Chiang troops in his heart, but he dared not express it openly, so he had to say, "They are all Chinese, they are all good!" The Chiang soldier then whipped the old man's face and eyes with his horsewhip, and continued to ask, "Is District Chief Ding (referring to the District Chief of Liangshui District Democratic Government in Xifeng) good?" The old man said, "Even if you beat me to death, I can't speak against my conscience. District Chief Ding both fights the old ways and works hard for the people. I dare not say he is good in front of you, but I can't say he is bad either!" The whip rained down on the old man's body and face. Later, when District Chief Ding returned here, the villagers, looking at the desolate town after the looting, surrounded District Chief Ding and cried together. A folk rhyme is popular in Xifeng city: "When the Japanese were here, we hoped for the Central Government; when the Central Government came, we suffered disasters. They rob grain, grab draftees to be 'national soldiers,' and treat old people as laborers." It is reported that more than ten thousand villagers in the four counties of Xifeng, Dongfeng, Xi'an, and Kaiyuan have been captured by Chiang's troops to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war, and old people are being forced to dig trenches and build blockhouses.

　　蒋军索丁万余西丰民心向我
    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】辽北西丰县城于五月十一日为蒋军侵占后，有一天，西丰城里的蒋军刘小胡子带着骑兵出去抢掠，抓住一位老百姓问道：“八路军好？中央军好？”老乡心里恨蒋军，但又不敢当面表露，只好说：“都是中国人，都好！”蒋军便用马鞭抽打这位老乡的脸和眼，并继续问：“丁区长（按指西丰凉水区民主政府区长）好不好？”老乡说：“你打死我，我也不能昧良心说话，丁区长又打老日子，又出力替老百姓作事，我不敢当你们的面说他好，但是我也不能说他坏呀！”鞭子雨点般的便飞往这位老乡的身上和脸上。以后丁区长回到这里，老乡们看着这被洗劫后的凄凉的镇子，围着丁区长哭成一团。西丰城内流行着一首民谣：“日本在时盼中央，盼来中央遭了殃，抢粮抓丁当‘国兵’，老年又把劳工当”。据悉：西丰、东丰、西安、开原等四县已有万余庄丁被蒋军抓去充当内战炮灰，老年人则被强迫着去挖战壕修炮楼。
