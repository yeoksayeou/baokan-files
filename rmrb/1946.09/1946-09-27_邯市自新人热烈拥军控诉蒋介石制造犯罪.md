Handan Self-Reformers Enthusiastically Support the Army and Accuse Chiang Kai-shek of Manufacturing Crimes
[This newspaper Handan, 24th dispatch] "We also want to support the army!" The self-reformers in our city's detention center, deeply influenced by the citizens' enthusiastic army support, made this request to the leadership. The leadership believed that "they don't need to donate, just have a clear ideological understanding of whether the Eighth Route Army is good for self-defense and whether Chiang Kai-shek's launching of the civil war is right or wrong." Therefore, the self-reformers engaged in a heated discussion at the meeting, painfully recalling their past, which aroused unparalleled resentment towards Chiang Kai-shek. Female self-reformers Du Chunyun and Cao Peishi both believed that "if Chiang Kai-shek had not been passively watching the war, the Eighth Route Army would have liberated Handan a year earlier, and the marriage problem could have been solved, and they would not have poisoned their husbands due to dissatisfaction with their marriages." At the meeting, they took out 900 yuan of the bonus they had earned from sewing and washing clothes for the past month to support the army. Under everyone's persuasion, they had to take back 500 yuan. Zhao Zizhong, secretary of the puppet Daoyin's office, said: "Chiang Kai-shek's non-resistance led the Japanese devils in, which made me a traitor. When the enemy surrendered, I wanted to go home, but old Chiang secretly ordered Guo Laiqin and Wang Kouying, the heads of the Handan traitors, to organize troops to resist the Eighth Route Army's surrender, and pulled me in again as an adjutant to fight the Eighth Route Army. Since I was captured, under the lenient policy and education of the democratic government, I realized that I was completely harmed by Chiang Kai-shek." Wang Shuangmian believed that "if the Eighth Route Army had come earlier, life would have been improved earlier, and I wouldn't have become a bandit and robbed people, and I wouldn't have been arrested." All twenty-one people in the center unanimously realized that their crimes were caused by the old society and Chiang Kai-shek. Finally, they collected 1,375 yuan, saved the cigarettes they were going to smoke, and wrote a letter of condolence, which they brought to the front-line soldiers to express their hatred for old Chiang and their love for the Eighth Route Army.

　　邯市自新人热烈拥军控诉蒋介石制造犯罪
    【本报邯郸二十四日讯】“我们也要拥军!”本市看守所自新人身受市民热烈拥军的影响，向领导上提出这一要求，领导上认为他们“不必献捐，只在思想上明确认识八路军自卫好不好，蒋介石发动内战对不对”就行了。于是自新人在会议上展开热烈讨论，沉痛追述自己的过去，引起对蒋介石的无比愤恨。女自新人杜春云和曹裴氏都认为“如果蒋介石不消极观战，八路军早一年解放邯郸，婚姻问题能得到解决，就不会因婚姻不满而毒害自己的丈夫。”她俩在会上把一月来缝洗衣服的红利九百元拿出拥军。在大家的劝阻下，她们只好又收回五百元。伪道尹公署秘书赵子忠说：“蒋介石不抵抗引进日本鬼子，叫我当了汉奸。敌人投降，我想回家，老蒋却给邯郸汉奸头子郭来芹、王寇英下密令，叫他们组织军队，抗拒八路军受降，又把我拉进去当副官，打八路军。自从我被俘到现在，在民主政府的宽大政策和教育下，我才知道自己是完全受了蒋介石的害。”王双眠认为“八路军要早点过来，生活早得到改善，就不会当土匪抢人，也就不会被押了。”全所二十一人一致认识到他们的罪恶都是旧社会和蒋介石造成的。最后他们凑集了一千三百七十五元，节约了自己要抽的纸烟，并写了一封慰劳信，一并带给前方将士，表示他们对老蒋的痛恨与对八路军的热爱。
