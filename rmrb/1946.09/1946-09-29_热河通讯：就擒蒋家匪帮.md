Hot River Dispatch: Capturing the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang
　　Hua Shan, from Weichang
    (1) Two divisions of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which had penetrated deep into western Rehe as an isolated force, were strung out along a hundred-li line, with only one regiment at the front outpost of Zhangsanyingzi (north of Longhua). The invaders, encountering resistance from the Eighth Route Army at Zhangsanyingzi, sensed that something was amiss and quietly retreated. Before leaving, they told the bandits they had gathered, "You are all part of the Central Army. You can expand your forces as much as you can, and we'll give you correspondingly high ranks."
    Bandit chiefs like "Double Four Points" and others then took over Zhangsanyingzi. He was a hated puppet Manchukuo policeman in Weichang, who had escaped the people's revenge and liquidation struggle after liberation, gathered many police agents and special forces, and engaged in robbery. Other bandit chiefs with similar backgrounds included "Four Seas," "Zhan Bei," "Zhi Jiaqi," "Zhan Bei Bian," and "Dong Yang." These stinking remnants of the puppet Manchukuo era became meritorious officials in the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek army. These six bandits, with a combined force of over a hundred "guns," recruited soldiers in the villages, proudly declaring, "This year's Mid-Autumn Moon is particularly bright, it's time for our Central Army to reunite." However, on the afternoon before the festival, the people led their own army into their homes, dragging "Double Four Points" from the warm kang. Just as he was about to be tied up, "Double Four Points" was still dreaming of his reunion, grinning and saying, "Don't joke around, are you really the Central Army?"
    The people's army and the villagers were not joking at all. The people served the bandits living in their homes with white flour and wine during the day, but quietly opened the door, brought in Eighth Route Army soldiers in plain clothes, and pointed to the kang, saying, "That's him, that's him!"
    The Rehe people's self-defense forces had released many bandits, giving them a chance to repent and start anew, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, intent on opposing the people, continued to harm them. The people could no longer forgive them. "Four Seas" and "Zhan Bei" were killed. Not one of the sixty-plus Chiang Kai-shek bandits escaped the people's vengeful anger. "Double Four Points" was also tied up and taken to Weichang, where he was publicly executed on the 14th.
    This is the first major victory of the Rehe people in their guerrilla warfare against the Chiang Kai-shek invaders. The Rehe people, resolutely opposed to "Manchukuo," have already begun to join hands with the Eighth Route Army, taking up arms to launch a broad-based mass self-defense guerrilla war, ruthlessly answering the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang that has penetrated deep into Rehe!

　　热河通讯：就擒蒋家匪帮
　  华山寄自围场
    （一）孤军深入热西的蒋家军两个师，搁在一百里长的点线上，最前哨张三营子（隆化北）只有一个团。在张三营子遭八路军阻击的进犯者，感到事情有点不妥，就悄悄地缩回去了。临走时，对他们收罗的土匪们说：“你们都是中央军，你们能扩充多大队伍，就放你们多大的官”。
    匪首“双四点”之流，于是接防了张三营子，他是围场街上无人不恨的伪满警察，解放后逃脱了群众复仇清算斗争，啸聚了许多警察特务，打家劫舍。同样来历的匪首，还有“四海”、“占北”、“殖加乞”、“占北边”、“东洋”等五人，这些伪满剩下的臭垃圾，到蒋家军手中，都成了功臣。这六个土匪合起来百余个“杆子”，在村中招兵买马，得意洋洋的说：“今年中秋月亮分外明，该咱们中央军团圆了”。但是，在过节的前一天下午，老百姓把自己的军队引到自己的房里，从热炕上拖起“双四点”，临到快绑起来的时候，“双四点”还在做他的团圆梦，咧着嘴说：“别开玩笑，你们到底是不是中央军？”
    人民的军队和村中的老百姓，一点也不开玩笑，老百姓白天侍候分住在他们家里的土匪们吃白面喝酒，却悄悄开了门，引进穿着便衣的八路军，指着炕头说：“就是，这就是！”
    热河人民自卫武装曾经释放过许多匪贼，让他们悔过自新，但是存心和人民作对的蒋家匪帮，却继续祸害人民，人民是不能再饶恕，“四海”和“占北”给打死了，六十几个蒋家匪帮，一个也没逃过人民的复仇怒火，“双四点”也绑到围场，在十四号当众枪毙了。
    这是热河人民从游击战争反对蒋家进犯者第一个大胜利，坚决反对“满洲”的热河人民，已经开始和八路军一起握着枪展开广泛的群众自卫游击战争，无情的回答深入热河的蒋家匪帮！
