Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai Dispatch: The Nationalist government raised the foreign exchange rate on the 19th of last month - from 2,020 Legal Tender (Chinese Yuan) per US dollar to 3,350. On the day this decision was announced, prices in various cities in the Nationalist-controlled areas immediately soared. As of the 7th of this month, in cities such as Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, Hankou, Chongqing, Kunming, and Guangzhou, gold once rose by more than 20% (Kunming reached 32%), and is now around 10%. Rice prices, except in a few rice markets, have been rising continuously. Tianjin rose by 20%, and Chongqing rice prices rose by more than 50%. However, the increase in the price of the US dollar is currently lower than the official exchange rate, generally around 3,200 yuan, so most people estimate that prices will continue to rise, causing the Nationalist areas to fall back into a vicious cycle of foreign exchange and prices. Although figures such as T.V. Soong and Wu Guozhen have repeatedly "advised" against further price increases, it has had no effect. According to Nanjing's Ren Bao (People's News), civil servants and non-civil servants are shedding tears and shouting "Long live T.V. Soong" to express their serious dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures. Another Shanghai newspaper estimates that the people's property lost 48% in value in one day, the 19th. According to Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao, the official reason for announcing the exchange rate change was to stimulate exports and reduce import surpluses, but it is rumored in Nanjing that the exchange rate was adjusted precisely on the 19th of last month because certain individuals' three major trading companies (referring to the import and export trading companies of the Kong-Soong financial clique) had recently purchased a large number of daily necessities at the old exchange rate, amounting to tens of thousands of tons, which were about to be imported. Therefore, they first increased the price to reap huge profits.

　　国民党区物价激涨
    原因是大批美货将入口
    当局提高美汇好发大财
    【新华社延安九日电】上海讯：国民党政府于上月十九日提高外汇汇率——从美金一元兑法币二千零廿元升至兑三千三百五十元。此一决定公布之日，国民党区各个城市物价立时激涨，截至本月七日为止，平津、太原、汉口、重庆、昆明、广州等各城市，黄金曾一度上涨至百分之二十以上（昆明曾达百分之三十二），现为百分之十左右。米价除少数米市外，均一直上涨，天津上涨百分之二十，重庆米价上涨了百分之五十以上。但美金上涨的程度，现都低于官方汇率，大率在三千二百元上下，故一般人士，估计物价将仍继续上涨，使国民党区重陷于外汇与物价恶性循环当中。宋子文及吴国桢辈虽然一再“劝告”不再涨价，但迄无效果。据南京人报称：公务员与非公务员两眼掉泪，大喊“宋子文万岁”，以表示对当局措施的严重不满。另据沪报估计，人民的财产在十九日一天之间损失百分之四十八。据天津大公报载称：官方宣布汇率变动之原因，系为刺激出口，减低入超，但南京盛传外汇汇率恰于上月十九日调整，是因为某些少数人物所经营之三大贸易公司（按即指孔宋财团的各进出口贸易公司）近日有以旧汇价格购得之大批日用品，数达一万数千吨即将进口，故先增其价以收大利。
