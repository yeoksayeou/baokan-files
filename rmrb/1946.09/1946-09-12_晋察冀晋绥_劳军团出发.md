Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th. The Jinchaji Border Region rear support groups arrived at the self-defense front one after another before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Zhangjiakou City Workers' Support Group carried comfort items worth more than 7,000 yuan and held a forum with officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army field corps in a certain place. When the support group mentioned that the workers in the rear factories were working overtime for more than twelve or three hours a day, serving the front day and night, the dense crowd shouted, "The elders, brothers, and sisters of the entire liberated area are supporting us. We must resolutely repel Chiang Kai-shek's attack!" "Use courageous battles to repay the workers' enthusiasm for increased production." The next day, all the worker representatives, carrying their luggage, walked to the front line to comfort the soldiers. The vehicles they were riding in were withdrawn to transport supplies and ammunition for the troops. The Huailai Township District Southern People's Support Group also arrived, after a long journey, at a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army that had been stationed in Huailai and fought bravely on its front line. The commanders and fighters inquired about local crop harvests, public security, self-defense, and other situations. A forum was held to solicit opinions from the masses on the unit's stationing. A women's representative said, "You can't find such a considerate team anywhere in the world. They were so tired from training in the first half of the year, but the soldiers still cleaned every household's doorway and yard early every morning, filled the water tanks in the evening, and even rushed to cut fodder for the livestock. We have an opinion: we hope you will repel the reactionary派's attack and return to Huailai to be stationed." The Cha Province and Xuanhua support groups, led by Zang Gongwu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, visited the wounded soldiers recuperating in the front-line field hospitals one by one, and gave each person towels, soap, cigarettes, moon cakes, grapes, and nutritional expenses.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 9th. The Jin Sui Border Region's Mid-Autumn Festival support group set off for the front line on the 6th. In recent days, the support group has received a total of more than 11.404 million yuan in agricultural notes voluntarily sent by various organs and the masses, more than 30,000 letters of condolences, and many daily necessities. This support group will conduct in-depth visits to companies and hospitals.
