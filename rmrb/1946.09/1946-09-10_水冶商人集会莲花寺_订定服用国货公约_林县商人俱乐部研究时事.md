　　[Report from our Changzhi office, 7th] In Anyang's Shuiye town, a patriotic movement to use domestic goods was launched in the latter half of last month. This movement was initiated by the town's Businessmen's Association, and merchants participated enthusiastically. A mass meeting of over five thousand people promoting domestic goods was held at Lotus Temple. On that day, all streets were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, hung with national flags, and plastered with colorful slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialist Economic Aggression" and "Love and Use Domestic Goods." At the meeting, three covenants proposed by the merchants were passed: (1) To sell off all foreign goods in the market within ten days. (2) To guarantee not to transport superstitious or luxury goods to the Liberated Areas. (3) To guarantee not to engage in smuggling; violators will be subject to punishment by the masses.

　　Another report: The merchants of Chengguan in Linxian also held a current affairs speech meeting on August 27th. After the meeting, an "Foreign Goods Auction House" was established to sell off foreign goods at half price within a limited time. Merchants in Hejian town in the county also established a "Merchant Club" to study current affairs and the struggle against the economic activities of the stubborn and puppet regimes every afternoon.
