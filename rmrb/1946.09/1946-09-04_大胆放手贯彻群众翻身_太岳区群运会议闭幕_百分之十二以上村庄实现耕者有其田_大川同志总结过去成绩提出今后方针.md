　　Boldly Unleash the Masses to Achieve Emancipation
    Taiyue Region Mass Movement Conference Concludes
    Over 12% of Villages Achieve "Land to the Tiller"
    Comrade Dachuan Summarizes Past Achievements and Proposes Future Guidelines
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 2nd dispatch] The Taiyue Regional Mass Work Conference, which opened on July 12th and concluded on August 28th, after 46 days of small and large group discussions, achieved correct solutions to issues such as realizing "land to the tiller," "boldly unleashing the masses," and "following the mass line," unifying understanding and organizing strength. In the final four days of the conference, Comrade Gu Dachuan of the Regional Party Committee delivered a concluding report. He assessed past achievements, proposed future guidelines and tasks, and pointed out that after nine months of a vigorous movement of pouring out grievances, settling accounts, and reducing rent and interest, the achievements were unprecedentedly great. However, there is still a long way to go to realize "land to the tiller," which requires even greater efforts in the future. Regarding past achievements, the summary pointed out that in the old liberated areas, among 979 villages, 535 villages had been mobilized relatively fully, realizing land to the tiller, accounting for 55% of all villages in the old liberated areas. The blank areas are less than 1%. The rest have been mobilized, but not sufficiently. Some only scratched the surface. In the new areas (excluding the border areas), among 4,146 villages, 201 villages had been mobilized relatively fully, realizing land to the tiller, accounting for 4.9% of all villages in the new areas. Blank areas accounted for 10%. In the remaining more than 80% of the villages and towns, the movement is continuing. Taking into account the old and new liberated areas and the border areas, only 12.8% of the villages in the entire region have achieved land to the tiller. 7.5% are blank areas, and the remaining villages are either being mobilized or have been mobilized but not sufficiently. Based on the above situation, based on the principle of eliminating feudal exploitation in rural areas to develop rural capitalism, and based on the spirit of boldly unleashing the masses, the conference loudly proposed the future guidelines and tasks for the entire region, unifying thinking, concentrating strength, and continuing to implement the anti-traitor settlement, rent and interest reduction, rent and interest refund, and repeated verification and reduction, in order to realize land to the tiller. Different tasks were proposed based on the different situations in the old and new liberated areas: In areas where mobilization has been relatively sufficient, the task is to consolidate farmers' land rights, develop production, and eliminate blank areas. In areas where mobilization is not yet sufficient, it is necessary to continue to go deep among the masses, discover problems, and, based on the masses' awareness and demands, lead the masses to deeply reduce rent and interest and refund rent and interest. The task in the new areas is to continue the anti-traitor settlement, rent and interest reduction, and rent and interest refund on the existing basis. Do not be arrogant or complacent, and repeatedly verify and reduce. In the border areas, due to the volatile environment, the first priority should be to lead the masses and all progressive people in anti-reactionary struggles, such as opposing massacres, opposing conscription, opposing grain grabbing, supporting labor service, exorbitant taxes and levies, corruption, occupation, and "soldier-farmer integration," in order to lift the shackles of the people and protect the lives and property of the masses. Finally, the conference pointed out that the entire region is still far from fully mobilizing the masses, and in the future, it is necessary to concentrate strength, unify steps, and lead this great movement. All other work not closely related to the mass movement can be stopped. At the sub-regional level, all systems should strive to concentrate 50% to 60% of their strength into the mass movement.

　　大胆放手贯彻群众翻身
    太岳区群运会议闭幕
    百分之十二以上村庄实现耕者有其田
    大川同志总结过去成绩提出今后方针
    【本报阳城二日电】太岳全区群众工作会议，自七月十二日召开，至八月二十八日结束，经过四十六天小会与大会讨论，对实现“耕者有其田”、“大胆放手”、“走群众路线”等问题，都获得了正确的解决，统一了认识，组织了力量。会议最后四天，由区党委顾大川同志作总结报告。估计了过去的成绩，提出了今后的方针与任务，指出经过九个月来轰轰烈烈的诉苦清算及减租减息运动，获得成绩是空前伟大的。但离实现“耕者有其田”还有很大距离，需要今后以更大的努力贯彻。关于过去的成绩，总结中指出：老解放区九百七十九个村庄，已有五百三十五村发动比较充分，实现了耕者有其田，占全老区村庄百分之五十五。空白区不及百分之一。其余都是已经发动，但不够充分。有的只从皮上过了一下。新区方面（边沿区除外），四千一百四十六个村，有二百零一村发动比较充分，已实现了耕者有其田，占全部新区村庄百分之四点九。空白区占百分之十。其余百分之八十以上的村镇，运动正继续进行中。新老解放区及边沿区合计，全区只有百分之十二点八的村庄实现了耕者有其田。百分之七点五是空白，其余村庄正在发动，或已发动而不够充分。根据上述情况，根据消灭农村封建剥削以发展农村资本主义的原则，根据大胆放手的精神，大会响亮提出了全区今后的方针与任务，统一思想，集中力量，继续贯彻反奸清算、减租减息、退租退息、反复查减，以实现耕者有其田。并根据新老解放区不同情况，分别提出不同任务：发动较充分地区是巩固农民地权，发展生产，消灭空白区。在发动尚不充分地区，要继续深入群众，发现问题，根据群众觉悟与要求，领导群众深入减租减息、退租退息。新区的任务，是在现有的基础上继续反奸清算、减租减息、退租退息。勿骄勿懈，反复查减。在边沿区因环境动荡，首先应该领导群众及一切进步人士进行反顽斗争。如反屠杀、反抓丁、反抢粮、支差、苛捐杂税、贪污、霸占及“兵农合一”等，以解除人民的枷锁，保护群众的生命财产。最后大会指出：全区离充分发动群众既有很大距离，今后就须集中力量、统一步调，领导这一伟大运动。除斗争动员外，其他与群运无大关联的工作可一律停止。分区一级各系统，应争取集中百分之五十到六十的力量投入群众运动。
