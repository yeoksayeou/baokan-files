　　Autumn Harvest is a Big Deal, One Person, One Scythe!
    Taihang Second Administrative Office Issues Autumn Harvest Instructions
    Precisely Calculate and Organize the Harvest
    Zuoquan Third District Launches Competition, Great Harvesting to Commence Soon
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi 16th Dispatch] The overall autumn harvest movement in the counties of the Taihang Mountains is about to begin. The Second Administrative Office has issued autumn harvest instructions, stating: "This year's autumn harvest is a time to vigorously support the front lines and carry out the emancipation movement. Therefore, we must accept last year's experience, promote the spirit of combat, and launch a new competition movement to ensure the rapid completion of the autumn harvest. Based on last year's experience, the following methods are proposed: (1) Break the thought of paralysis, establish a unified leadership organization in the village as early as possible, and plan the organization of forces to ensure that the front-line participates in the war, and the rear work can also be completed on schedule. (2) Calculate accurately, scientifically organize labor and livestock, arrange life, accept last year's method of planting wheat, harvesting autumn, and cultivating land at the same time, without taking empty roads, cutting one piece at a time, and implementing the "clean sweep" method of evaluating land and distributing labor upon entering the land and evaluating people upon leaving the land. Save labor and prepare to support the front line at any time. (3) "Autumn harvest is a big deal, one person, one scythe", mobilize a wide range of women and children to participate, achieve reasonable division of labor, make the best use of talents, calculate work by the piece, and unify wages, so that women and children can benefit. Implement large-scale village work exchange to improve production efficiency and overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. And expand and improve the mutual aid organization in the village one step further.
    In addition: Various villages in the third district of Zuoquan have begun to launch the autumn harvest. Shangwu Village has challenged Tongtan Town to a competition. At present, in addition to formulating autumn harvest plans, the various villages and mutual aid organizations are still busy with various preparations, such as the autumn harvest committee of Shangwu has repaired all major and minor roads, built a bridge, and the wheat fertilizer has been prepared and inspected. The village plans to complete the harvest of walnuts and prepare for autumn coal burning, and the great harvest will commence at the end of the month (late August in the lunar calendar). Currently, they are only beginning to harvest hemp and various early-maturing crops. The slogan put forward is: "Cut one piece at a time, cultivate as you cut, leave no land uncultivated, hurry up with work, and support the front line." It is also proposed that even if they are extremely busy, the militiamen must also wipe their guns and practice martial arts at any time, waiting for orders to be dispatched.

　　秋收没大小，一人一镰刀！
    太行二专署发出秋收指示         
    精确计算组织收耕
    左权三区展开竞赛不日大开镰
    【本报长治十六日电】太行山西各县全面的秋收运动即将开始。二专署特发出秋收指示称：“今年的秋收正是轰轰烈烈支援前线和进行翻身运动的时候，因之必须接受去年经验，发扬战斗作风，展开新的竞赛运动，才能保证秋收的迅速完成。特依据去年经验，提出以下办法：（一）打破麻痹思想，即早建立村中统一领导的机构，有计划的组织力量，保证前方参战，后方工作亦能按期完成。（二）精确计算，科学的组织劳畜力，安排生活，接受去年一面种麦，一面收秋，一面垦地，不走空路，割了一块割一块，实行进地评地分，出地评人分的“一扫光”办法。节省劳力准备随时支援前线。（三）“秋收没大小，一人一镰刀”，动员广泛的妇女儿童参加，做到合理分工，人尽其材，按件计工，统一工资，使妇女儿童都得到利益。实行全村大变工，提高生产效率，克服劳力不足的困难。并使村中互助组织扩大与提高一步。
    又：左权三区各村已开始展开秋收，上武村已向桐滩镇提出挑战竞赛。现各村各互助组织除订定秋收计划外，所忙的仍为各种准备工作，如上武的秋收委员会已补修各大路小道，搭桥一座，种麦肥料已预备齐全，并经过检查，该村计划先完成收核桃及准备好秋季烧煤，月底（阴历八月下旬）即大开镰。目前才开始收麻及各种早熟作物，提出的口号是：“割了一块割一块，随割随耕，不留垦地，赶出工来，支援前线”。并提出虽万分忙迫，民兵亦须随时擦枪练武，待命出动。
