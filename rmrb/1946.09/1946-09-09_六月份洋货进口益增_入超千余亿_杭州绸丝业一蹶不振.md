Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: Foreign goods imports increased in June, and the trade deficit worsened. The *Times* newspaper reports statistics from the Shanghai Customs showing imports totaling over 12.6 trillion yuan, while exports were only 670 billion yuan. The former is 19 times the latter, with a trade deficit reaching over 11.59 trillion yuan. Based on the average monthly figures from 1932 to 1937, calculated at the average exchange rate against the US dollar, imports in June exceeded pre-war levels by 60%, while the trade deficit was 38 times the pre-war level. Considering the first half of the year, the trade deficit for the first half of this year totaled over 30 trillion yuan, 17 times the average semi-annual trade deficit (converted to US dollars) of the pre-war years.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Hangzhou dispatch: Local industry and commerce are rapidly collapsing under the flood of American goods. Many shops, despite putting up signs like "Buy One Get One Free" and "Free Fan Included" for significant price reductions, still cannot compete with the attraction of cheap and good American goods. From November 15th of last year to the present, 108 shops have already closed down. The Yanjing Industrial Fishing Company in Hangzhou closed down earlier this month, with losses reaching over 100 million yuan. Hangzhou silk, famous nationwide and crucial for exports, is similarly unable to escape bankruptcy. In less than four months up to last month, 50 to 60 silk stores have already closed, accounting for a quarter of the total of over 260 silk stores in Hangzhou. There are over 53 stores that have closed. On average, over 20 industrial and commercial enterprises are closing each month in the city, and the future is very pessimistic.

　　六月份洋货进口益增
    入超千余亿
    杭州绸丝业一蹶不振
    【新华社南京六日电】六月份的洋货进口益增，入超亦益严重。时代日报载沪江海关统计的数字，进口共值一千二百六十万万余元，出口仅六十七万万元，前者为后者的十九倍，入超达一千一百五十九万万余元。按一九三二年至三七年，全国每月平均数字平均折合美金时价计算，则六月份进口超过战前百分之六十，入超则为战前三十八倍。如以半年计，则本年上半年入超共达三十余万万元，为战前各该年平均半年入超数（折合美金）的十七倍。
    【新华社延安四日电】杭州讯：此间工商业在美货泛滥下，已迅速趋向崩溃。许多商号虽挂出“买一送一”“赠送团扇”等大减价的招牌，仍不抵价廉物美的美货吸引顾客。从去年十一月十五日到现在，已有一百零八家商店倒闭。杭市盐桥实业渔行上月初倒闭，亏欠达一万万余元。全国闻名占出口重要位置的杭州绸丝，同样难逃破产命运。截至上月不到四个月时间，已有五六十家绸庄倒闭、占杭州绸庄总数二百六十多家的四分之一。在庄倒闭者已有五十三家以上。全市工商业平均每月要倒闭二十多家，前途殊为悲观。
