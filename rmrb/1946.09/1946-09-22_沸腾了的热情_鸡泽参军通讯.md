Boiling Enthusiasm
A Dispatch from Jize on Enlistment

The masses of Jize, having been liberated, responded to the call of the CPC Central Bureau to strive for victory in the Patriotic Self-Defense War, and the entire county immediately launched a red-hot wave of enlistment. The county leader said: "There is not a single village that is not enlisting, and it is impossible to find individuals enlisting alone; collective enlistment is a common phenomenon." The masses automatically solve the difficulties of the families of those who enlist; they don't wait for you to bring up the difficulties and ask for solutions. The masses show no mercy to those who want to get rich by enlisting, saying: "You stay home; we can't buy soldiers."

The masses of Wu Guanying automatically convened a meeting to discuss enlistment. The Workers' and Peasants' Association, led by Ye Wenzhang, was originally discussing preferential treatment and resistance, but on the spot, fourteen strong men who had shaved their beards wanted to enlist. When this news reached the ears of the militia and women, the militia retorted: "Even if you shave your beards and enlist, you won't pass the examination; watch us." At the women's meeting, just as the meeting was announced, Little Hei's wife stood up and said: "I will mobilize my man to enlist!" Before she could finish her sentence, fourteen or fifteen women immediately signed up, saying, "We want to send our men to drive back old Chiang." Xu Jiming's mother said: "All my life, I have lived in famine and scarcity. Ever since the Eighth Route Army liberated us, our family has had more than thirty mu of land and raised an ox. My son married a wife. If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, I would never have dreamed of this life. I guarantee that I will tell Jiming to enlist." As she spoke, she looked at her daughter-in-law's face. Qiu Ling (Jiming's wife) stood up and said resolutely: "Mother, if he doesn't go, I will help you mobilize him and guarantee that he will go."

Ma Yunhan, the director of the Farmers' Association, has been really worried these days. He calculates that he is already thirty-six years old, and looking in the mirror, his face is full of beard, and he is not qualified to enlist. Thinking of his title as a model Communist Party member, he became even more depressed. Little Haizi (Yunhan's son) is eighteen years old, and he will marry a wife in September. Besides, how could his mother bear to let him go? He felt that this enlistment work could no longer express his revolutionary enthusiasm. In this way, depression seized his heart. Only the wife understands her husband's distress. When Haizi's mother saw him like this, she thought it was about the enlistment. Haizi's mother is not only a virtuous wife and loving mother who is good at understanding her husband and doting on her son, but she is also a Communist Party member with several years of party membership. Therefore, after she understood her husband's heart disease, she asked someone to discuss it with her in-laws and mobilized Haizi herself. After she explained it well, she said to her husband: "Don't worry, there is no problem with your in-laws and Haizi." Haizi also said to his father: "What is there to worry about? I'm going to enlist." Yunhan smiled slightly after hearing what his mother and son said.

Thirty-seven young people from Wu Guanying were sent to the troops, but after inspection, only eighteen were left. The new soldiers who did not pass the inspection returned home with their heads hanging down. Bai Shangxian returned home and said to his wife with tears in his eyes: "What face do I have to see people?" Shangxian's mother rushed to the district cadres, as if fighting, and said: "What are the conditions for rejecting us? He's young and strong, but he can't even be a soldier. The inspectors should explain to me, what conditions are needed to be a soldier? Aren't we doing this to fight old Chiang?"

### 沸腾了的热情  鸡泽参军通讯

　　沸腾了的热情
    鸡泽参军通讯
    翻身后的鸡泽群众，听到中共中央局争取爱国自卫战争胜利的号召后，全县立刻掀起了热火朝天的参军浪潮。该县负责人谈：“没有不参军的村庄，找不到单个的人参军，集体入伍是普遍的现象”。群众解决参军者家属困难，都是自动的，不是等你提出困难，要求解决，群众对那些借参军想发财的，毫不留情的说：“你看家吧，不能买兵。”
    吴官营的群众，自动召集会议，讨论参军，叶文章领导的工农会，本来是讨论优抗等工作，当场竟有十四个刮了胡子的壮年要参军，这消息传到民兵及妇女耳朵里去，民兵不服气的说：“你们刮了胡子参军也验不上，看我们的吧”。妇女们的会议上，刚刚宣布开会，小黑的媳妇挺起胸膛说：“我动员俺当家的去参军”一句话没有说完，随即有十四五个妇女齐声报名“要送郎去打退老蒋”。徐继明的母亲说：“俺这一辈子，都是饥饥荒荒的过日子，自从八路军解放咱们后，俺家才有三十多亩地，喂一头牛，俺孩子娶了媳妇，这日子要不是八路军，做梦也想不到啊，我保证叫俺继明去参军”。她一面说，一面看他儿媳妇的面色，秋菱（继明媳妇）慨然的站起来说：“娘，他要不去我帮助你动员，保准叫他去”。
    农会主任马韵翰，这几天可真愁坏了，他算算自己的年龄已经三十有六了，再照镜子满脸胡子，参军已不够资格了，想想自己模范共产党员的称号，使他更加苦闷。小海子（韵翰的儿子）虽然十八岁，眼看在九月就娶媳妇，再说他娘怎能舍的叫他去呀，自己感觉这次参军工作，再也无法表现自己革命的积极性了。这样一来苦闷抓住了他的心。丈夫的苦恼只有妻子最明白，海子娘看到他这个样子，就想到是为参军的事，海子娘不仅是善于体谅丈夫溺爱儿子的贤妻良母，同时她还是个好几年党龄的共产党员，所以她了解丈夫心病后，便托人去亲家商量，自己动员海子，经她讲好后，便对她丈夫说：“不用愁了，亲家和海子都没有问题了”：海子也给他父亲说：“什么事情值得愁，我去参军去了。”韵翰听他娘俩这样一说，才微微的笑了。
    吴官营三十七个青年送到部队里去，经过检验后，只留下十八名，验不上的新战士，都垂头丧气的回来了，白尚贤回到家里，满眼泪水对媳妇说：“我有啥脸见人。”尚贤娘气冲冲的到区干部那里，像打架似的说：“有啥条件把俺验回去，年青青的，身子又壮实，连个兵也当不上，检验员给俺讲讲，什么条件才能当兵，俺不是为的打老蒋吗？”。
