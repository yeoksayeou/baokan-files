Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Paris dispatch: The Italian Political Committee continued to debate the Trieste issue on the 16th. Representatives from the US and Yugoslavia delivered speeches. Connelly, representing the United States, made statements whose main points were vastly different from Molotov's previous speech. Politically, Connelly stated that the United States was extremely concerned about the relationship between the Free Territory of Trieste and the United Nations Security Council, considering this relationship extremely important; Molotov's speech, on the other hand, emphasized that with the assistance of the four powers, the people of the Free Territory could obtain genuine democracy and autonomy. Militarily, Connelly advocated that the Security Council dispatch armed forces to garrison the Free Territory; Molotov advocated that no foreign troops should be stationed in the Free Territory, including the Security Council's forces. Molotov stated that the United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security Council's forces are to be used to deal with acts of aggression, but what is the purpose of stationing troops in Trieste? Economically, Connelly opposed Molotov's proposal for economic cooperation between the Free Territory and Yugoslavia, and further asserted that the Free Territory "must be separated from Yugoslavia and Italy." The Yugoslav representative, in his speech, condemned the US and Britain for deploying a "dense iron curtain" around the Mediterranean, attempting to build a bridgehead in the city of Trieste in preparation for future military actions against Yugoslavia.

　　莫洛托夫对的港发表声明后
    美代表提出荒谬见解
    南责英美在地中海布署军事
    【新华社延安十八日电】巴黎讯：意大利政治委员会于十六日继续辩论的里雅斯特问题。美南代表发表演说。康纳利代表美国声明的要点与莫洛托夫前此的演说大相径庭。在政治上，康氏称美国极其关怀的里雅斯特自由区与联合国安理会的关系，认为此项关系极具重要性；莫氏的演说则侧重于在四强的协助之下自由区人民能获得真正的民主与自治。在军事上，康氏主张由安理会派定武装部队驻防自由区；莫氏则主张任何外国军队都不必在自由区驻兵，安理会的部队亦包括在内。莫氏曾称联合国宪章规定安理会的部队是用于对付侵略行动，但在的里雅斯特驻军的目的何在呢？在经济上，康纳利反对莫洛托夫关于自由区与南斯拉夫经济的合作的建议，并进而主张自由区“必须脱离南斯拉夫与意大利”。南代表发言时，谴责美英在地中海周围布署“厚密的铁幕”，试图在的城建筑桥头堡垒，以备来日对南国采取军事行动。
