　　Yan Xishan Seizes Men for Military Service and Labor to Expand the Civil War
　　Pingyao Merchants Flee to Taiyue
　　Secret Agents Discovered Hidden in Yuli Village, Shexian County
　　[Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng on the 25th] According to those who escaped from Pingyao, which is occupied by Yan's army, Yan's army is currently seizing men for military service and labor on a large scale within the city. Out of Pingyao's total population of 50,000, 10,000 are being forced to construct various civil war fortifications under the bayonets of Yan Xishan's military police and secret agents. All schools were forced to suspend classes uniformly in late August to participate in this kind of hard labor. The fourteen secret service agencies spread throughout the city are imprisoning eight hundred "suspects." Most of these people are farmers who have been thrown into prison for opposing Yan Xishan's "soldier-peasant integration" civil war policy, and two hundred of them have already been buried alive. Yan Xishan still feels this is not enough and has now established a so-called "People's Self-Defense Army," in which people from all walks of life, including workers, farmers, merchants, and students, aged 18 to 47, are forced to serve in the military, acting as his tools for civil war. Hiring soldiers and buying soldiers has now become an important black market transaction, with a substitute costing twenty taels of gold. A shop called Tongxingyuan, with a manager and shop assistants totaling six people, has had three of them drafted into the army and two seized for labor, thus being forced to close down. Because they were unwilling to be slaves for Yan Xishan, the six of them have now fled to the Taiyue Liberated Area together. There are many others who escaped at the same time as them, and the democratic government has sent people to comfort them and help them solve their living difficulties.
　　[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi on the 23rd] Just as the military and civilians of our entire district are devoting themselves to the war of self-defense, secret agents hiding in the interior are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. When the masses of Yuli Village, in the second district of Shexian County, were discussing the current situation at the village public office at night, someone suddenly threw stones and bricks into the office. The masses rushed out and caught Liu Zhunan and Liu Siban. After a brief interrogation that night, they were released on bail to go home. Unexpectedly, Liu and the others were forced by their secret agent superior, Liu Handang, to hang themselves that very night. After Liu Handang was captured by the village public office, he confessed that he had forced the two Lius to death in order not to reveal his secret plan for sabotage. A similar incident also occurred in Changle Village on the same night. This has caused serious vigilance among the military and civilians of the entire county.

　　阎锡山抓丁抓夫扩大内战
　　平遥商人逃来太岳
　　涉县峪里村发现潜藏特务
    【本报阳城二十五日电】据自阎军占据之平遥逃出者谈，阎军现正在城内大肆抓丁抓夫，平遥全城五万人口，却有一万人在阎锡山军警宪特的刺刀下被迫构筑各种内战工事，所有学校，八月下旬均一律被迫停课，参加此种苦役。布满全城的十四个特务机关，囚禁着八百“嫌疑犯”，这些人多是因反对阎锡山的“兵农合一”的内战政策而被投入监狱的农民，其中二百人已被活埋。阎锡山尤嫌不足，现复成立所谓“人民自卫军”，凡十八岁至四十七岁之工农商学各界人士，均被迫服兵役，为其充当内战工具。雇兵、买兵，现成为黑市的重要交易，雇一个兵顶替索价黄金二十两，有个商店叫同兴源，经理店伙共六人，其中三人已被抽去当兵，两人被抓去做工，因此被迫停业。彼六人因不甘替阎锡山当奴隶，现已相率逃至太岳解放区，与他们同时逃出者还有很多人，民主政府已派专人前往抚慰，并帮助他们解决生活困难。
    【本报长治二十三日电】正当我全区军民致力于自卫战争，潜藏于内地的特务乘机蠢动。涉县二区峪里村群众，于夜间在村公所讨论时局时，突有人掷入乱石砖瓦，群众蜂拥而出，当捉获刘竹南、刘四本二人。当夜略加审问后，即讨保回家。讵料刘等于是夜竟被其特务上级刘汉当逼迫，上吊自杀。刘汉当被村公所捉获后，供认逼死二刘，乃为不泄露其破坏工作之秘密计划。同夜长乐村亦发生类似事件。现全县军民已引起严重警惕。
