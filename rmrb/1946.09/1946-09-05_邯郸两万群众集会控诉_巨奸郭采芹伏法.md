　　邯郸 Two Myriad Masses Gather to Accuse
    巨奸 Guo Caiqin Executed

    [From our newspaper in Handan, 3rd]: Guo Caiqin, a notorious traitor in southern Hebei, was publicly tried and executed by shooting in Beisucao Village, Handan, on August 25th, by two myriad masses. Guo was successively a division commander under the Northern Warlord Sun Chuanfang and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. During the "July 7th" Incident, he betrayed the nation and surrendered to the enemy, serving as the chief captain of the puppet "剿共" (bandit suppression) training corps. He raped, plundered, kidnapped, and conscripted, slaughtering and burying countless anti-Japanese cadres and masses alive. The people of southern Hebei hated him to the bone. Guo was arrested when Handan was liberated last autumn. After multiple interrogations, Guo confessed to everything without denial. Recently, in response to the people's request, a public trial was held. Old women and young women from dozens of miles away came in carts with dry rations, rushing day and night to seek justice and revenge for their sons and husbands. At the meeting, the masses braved the rain to accuse him, filled with extreme anger. Old Mrs. Li from He Village pointed at Guo and cried, "My family of four only had one child left. He didn't want to be a puppet soldier, so you buried him alive. How cruel! You extinguished the lineage of my family..." The old woman's eyes were glazed, she seemed to be going mad, and suddenly grabbed Guo, taking off her shoe and beating his face fiercely. Liu Changsheng and other children from Liu Village, all under fourteen years old, also complained, pulling at Guo, demanding the return of their fathers who had been shot by him. Two myriad masses simultaneously raised their fists and shouted, "Shoot the traitor Guo Caiqin! Seek justice for the murdered people!" The democratic government accepted the people's demands, immediately announced Guo's death sentence, and carried out the execution by shooting. The whole venue erupted in thunderous applause, satisfying the people's hearts, saying, "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, we wouldn't be able to avenge this!"
