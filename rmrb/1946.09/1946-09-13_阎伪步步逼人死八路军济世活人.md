Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 7th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee's first batch of over 400,000 catties of relief grain has been transported to the outskirts of Datong. A working group to assist in the emergency relief efforts has also arrived at the same time. They have now begun investigating and distributing relief, deeply appreciated by the masses who have suffered from Puppet Yan's disasters. The disaster victims of Ershilipu, who had been filling their stomachs with wheat stalks for a long time, couldn't help but shed tears when they each received dozens of catties of millet and corn, saying, "Puppet Yan's troops want the poor people's lives, but the Eighth Route Army has saved our lives!" A landlord surnamed Yan in Luotuochang repeatedly said, "Those who obey the people will prosper, and those who go against the people will perish. The Eighth Route Army has strict discipline. As soon as they arrived, they exempted the people from burdens, and now they are distributing grain to relieve the people's distress. You truly deserve to be the people's savior. The future of the ancient Chinese nation, ravaged by warlords and bureaucrats, will surely be bright." According to a preliminary investigation by the Border Region Relief Work Group, since this spring, the villages have been robbed of more than 186,000 dan of stored grain by Puppet Yan's troops, as well as 5,340 pigs and sheep, and 378 mules, horses, and other livestock. The value of the money and property extorted amounted to 46.88 million yuan in legal tender. Twenty-eight or nine people from all walks of life were buried alive by Puppet Yan for being unable to pay, and 75 were hung up and tortured. There are currently 45,030 disaster victims who are completely without food and clothing and urgently need relief. The general disaster-stricken masses also need a large amount of grain and clothing relief to survive the impending severe cold in the border region.

　　阎伪步步逼人死八路军济世活人
    【新华社张家口七日电】晋察冀边区行政委员会，首批救济粮四十余万斤已运抵大同城郊，协助办理急赈的工作团亦于同时到达，现已开始调查放赈工作，深受阎伪灾难的广大群众，初次受到民主政府的救济慰问，二十里铺灾民以麦秸等充饥已久，当每人领到数十斤小米玉黍时，不禁热泪横流的说：“阎伪军要了穷人的命，八路军可救了咱的命呵！”骆驼场一位阎姓地主再三的说：“顺民者昌，逆民者亡，八路军纪律严明，一来到就免掉民负，现在又发粮解救民困，你们真是不愧为人民的救命军。被军阀官僚糜烂的中华古邦，前途一定是光明的。”据边区赈灾工作团初步调查，今春以来各村已被大同阎伪抢劫存粮十八万六千余石，猪羊五千三百四十头，骡马等牲畜三百七十八头，被劫夺勒索款项财物，值四千六百八十八万余元法币，各阶层群众因无力缴纳而横遭阎伪活埋者，廿八九人，被吊打凌虐者七十五人，现完全无衣无食急待赈救之灾民，达四万五千零三十人，一般被灾群众亦需大宗粮食衣物赈救，始能渡过即将届临的塞上严寒。
