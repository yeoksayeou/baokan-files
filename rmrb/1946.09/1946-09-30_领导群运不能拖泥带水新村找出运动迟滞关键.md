　　Leading the Mass Movement Must Not Be Procrastinating: Xincun Finds Key to Stagnation of the Movement
    [From our newspaper in Changzhi] The struggle of the masses in Xincun against local tyrants and landlords has been ongoing, but it has lacked vigor. According to a recent review, there are several reasons for this: First, the struggle emphasized one-sided debates. The masses produced conclusive evidence, both in the form of testimonies and material evidence, of the local tyrant's crimes, but the other side continued to deny and quibble, refusing to admit their mistakes. The leadership failed to resolve the issues promptly based on the opinions of the masses, leading to a decline in morale. Second, large meetings were held for four or five days at a time, without summarizing experiences or studying methods each day, causing the problems to drag on and delaying the masses' production. Third, there were too many targets of struggle. Before one person's problems were resolved, the struggle against the second person would begin, but none of them were resolved. Fourth, some of the fruits of the struggle were not distributed to the households that suffered losses but were used by the militia to buy bullets, which the masses were not satisfied with. Fifth, the intentions of the activists and the masses were not consistent, and the leadership failed to educate and enlighten them in action to bring them into alignment, lacking a common goal. Women were completely neglected and not mobilized at all. After this review, the district and village leadership has begun to make practical improvements, and it is expected that a new situation will soon emerge in the mass movement in the village.

　　领导群运不能拖泥带水新村找出运动迟滞关键
    【本报长治讯】平定新村群众对恶霸地主的斗争一直在进行，但一直不起劲。据最近检讨，有以下几个原因：一、斗争中片面的强调双方辩论。群众把恶霸的罪恶事实人证物证都确凿地拿了出来，对方仍抵赖狡辩，不肯认错。领导上不能及时依照群众意见解决，以致群众情绪低落。二、开大会一开四、五天，每天都不总结经验，研究方法，问题拖延下去，耽误了群众生产。三、斗争对象太多，一个人的问题还没解决，就又开始斗争第二个，那一个也斗了，那一个也没有解决。四、有些斗争果实没有分给受损失户，而叫民兵买了子弹，群众不满意。五、积极分子与群众意图不一致，领导上也未能在行动中教育启发，使之一致起来，没有共同的目标。妇女群众，则根本被忽视，没有发动起来。经过这个检讨，区村领导上已开始实际地改进，预计该村群运不久即将出现一新的局面。
