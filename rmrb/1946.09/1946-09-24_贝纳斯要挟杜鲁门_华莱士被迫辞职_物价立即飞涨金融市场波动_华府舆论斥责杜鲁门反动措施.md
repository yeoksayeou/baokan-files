Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 21st: According to Agence France-Presse and other Washington reports of the 20th: U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace has resigned at Truman's request. After a brief discussion with Truman, Wallace submitted his resignation, stating: "In accordance with your request, I submit my resignation, but I will continue to fight for peace." Now H. Rodney Young has been appointed acting Secretary of Commerce. Washington observers believe that Truman made this decision because Byrnes, during a telephone conversation on the 19th, expressed considerable dissatisfaction with Wallace's speech and issued an ultimatum: either Wallace resigns, or Byrnes would refuse to continue to be responsible for the Paris Peace Conference. According to an Agence France-Presse reporter: "American diplomatic circles in Paris estimate that this matter once again proves that Byrnes's foreign policy has been unconditionally approved by the U.S. government." On the morning of the 20th, reporters crowded the White House, a scene similar to the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident, to hear Truman's statement on Wallace's resignation. Truman began reading the statement in dead silence, his voice faint and trembling, until the official announcement. In the statement, Truman affirmed his complete agreement with Byrnes's foreign policy and then explained: "The U.S. government itself must remain united. Since a "fundamental conflict" has been discovered between Wallace and the government's foreign policy, the only solution is Wallace's resignation." He also stated: "U.S. foreign policy remains unchanged and is not intended to be changed. We still fully support Byrnes." Truman concluded by stating that in the future, no government personnel will be allowed to make speeches criticizing current policies or foreign policy, and all public statements on foreign policy must be approved by the State Department before publication. If there are disagreements, I will make my own judgment. According to United Press: Wallace's resignation will affect the Democratic Party's election campaign, with liberals in the party believing that they will lose an effective attraction in the election. After Wallace's resignation, the financial markets fluctuated greatly. Prices of grains and cotton on the exchange immediately rose, with cotton rising by about two dollars, Chicago wheat averaging one and a half cents, and steel soaring. With Wallace's forced resignation, the Truman administration has become a completely homogeneous government, and all members of the former Roosevelt administration have been excluded. Originally, after Wallace met with Truman on the 18th, he had reached a temporary compromise. Truman allowed Wallace to continue as Secretary of Commerce, and Wallace agreed not to make foreign policy speeches for the time being. However, after Truman spoke with Byrnes in Paris on the 19th, Truman's press secretary Ross denied on the same day that Truman had reached a compromise with Wallace, and then Truman demanded Wallace's resignation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 21st: Washington News: After the news of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace's forced resignation spread, progressive groups, individuals, and newspapers in Washington expressed dissatisfaction and criticized it. Democratic Senator Pepper predicted on the night of the 20th that Wallace's resignation would have far-reaching impacts on the United States and possibly also on the Democratic Party. Pepper strongly stated: "The President initially modestly agreed with Wallace's speech and then denied it." The National Citizens Political Action Committee issued a statement stating: Wallace's forced resignation is a blow to progressive forces and the cause of peace across the country, and progressive and independent people have lost a powerful spokesperson in the government. The statement strongly criticized, "Now there are no leaders in the cabinet who oppose reactionary hard-line policies, which indicates to what extent our government has stumbled onto the road leading to war." The Chicago Sun agreed with Wallace's speech, saying: "Since Roosevelt's death, Wallace has not only been the most contributing person to the country, but he has also explained what kind of foreign policy we should adopt in order to promote world peace."

　　贝纳斯要挟杜鲁门
    华莱士被迫辞职
    物价立即飞涨金融市场波动
    华府舆论斥责杜鲁门反动措施
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据法新闻处等华盛顿二十日讯：美商务部长华莱士已应杜鲁门之要求而辞职。在与杜鲁门略事商谈之后，华氏即呈递辞呈，内称：“遵照你的要求，我提出辞职，但我当继续为和平而奋斗”。现在罗德·杨格已被委为代理商务部长。华府观察家认为杜鲁门作出这一决定，是因十九日与贝纳斯通电话时，贝纳斯表示对华莱士演说颇表不满，并提出最后通牒，或者华莱士辞职，否则贝纳斯当拒绝继续担负巴签和会的工作。据法新闻处记者称：“巴黎美外交界估计，此事再次证明贝纳斯的外交政策得到美政府的无条件批准。”二十日晨，记者拥在白宫，情形一如珍珠港事件爆发时相似，前来听取杜鲁门发表对华氏辞职的声明。杜鲁门在死一般的寂静中开始宣读声明，声音微而战栗，至正式宣布声明时为止。在声明中，杜鲁门肯定完全赞成贝纳斯的外交政策之后，复作解释称：“美政府本身必须保持团结，华莱士与政府外交政策之间既已发现“基本冲突”，唯一的解决办法，就是华氏辞职。”并称：“美外交政策依然不变，并不拟有所改变，我们仍然完全支持贝纳斯”。杜鲁门最后称：今后不会再有政府人员发表批评现行方针或外交政策的言论，一切有关外交政策的公开声明，均应在发表之前经国务院核准，如有不同意之处，我将自作判断。据合众社称：华莱士之辞职，将影响民主党的竞选，该党自由分子认为在竞选中将失一有效之吸引力。华莱士辞职后，金融市场甚为波动，交易所的谷物棉花立即涨价，棉花约涨二元，芝加哥小麦平均涨一分半，钢铁亦飞涨不已。按华莱士被迫辞职后，杜鲁门政府已变成清一色的政府，前罗斯福政府的所有阁员已全被排斥出去。原来华莱士十八日在与杜鲁门晤谈后，曾取得暂时妥协，杜鲁门允许华氏继续任商务部长，华莱士则允许暂不作外交政策演说。但杜鲁门十九日与在巴黎的贝纳斯通话后，同日杜鲁门新闻秘书罗思即否认杜鲁门已与华莱士获得妥协，接着杜鲁门即要求华氏辞职。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】华盛顿讯：美商务部长华莱士被迫辞职的消息传出后，华府进步团体、人士及报纸咸表不满，并纷起指责。民主党参议员泼贝尔二十日夜预测华莱士的辞职，将对美国、并且亦可能对民主党有着远大的影响。泼氏力称：“总统原先自谦地同意华莱士的演说，然后又把它加以否认。”全国公民政治行动委员会发表声明称：华莱士之被迫辞职，乃是对全国进步势力及和平事业的打击，进步与独立的人士丧失了他们在政府中一个有力的发言人。声明力斥“现在内阁中已没有任何反对反动的强硬政策的领袖了，此表示了我们政府已失足于导向战争道路到了什么地步”。芝加哥太阳报赞同华莱士演说称：“自罗斯福逝世后，华莱士不但为国家最有贡献之人，并且他已说明我们应采取何种外交政策始能促进世界和平。”
