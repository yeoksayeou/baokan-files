Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 12th: The principal culprits in the Harbin conspiracy and military riot case, Jiang Pengfei, Li Mingxin, Cui Dagang, and others, were publicly tried by the Harbin military and government authorities in a special court session lasting eight hours on the 9th. The evidence was conclusive, and the defendants confessed without denial. They were sentenced to death on the spot and executed by firing squad on the 10th. These individuals, acting on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek and Du Yuming, organized Japanese and puppet troops, along with bandits, to plan a riot inside and outside Harbin on August 28th, intending to seize Harbin and then capture Jiamusi. However, their plot was uncovered by the local public security authorities two days before the planned riot. Jiang Pengfei was a notorious major traitor, later appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the commander of the newly formed 27th Army. Li Mingxin had served as a major Japanese spy for many years and was a military committee member of the Northeast Four Provinces Branch of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee's Enemy Rear Area Work Committee. Cui Dagang, as the commander of the 3rd Army of the 6th Route Army, had defected to the enemy three times. All of them were direct organizers of this conspiracy and riot.

　　In January of this year, Jiang was instructed by Chiang Kai-shek to go to Northeast China and infiltrate the Harbin area to secretly recruit local Japanese troops, puppet troops, and bandits, responsible for disrupting the rear (referring to the rear of the Democratic Allied Army), waiting for an opportunity to occupy Harbin. Documents seized this time proved that he had successively recruited more than 30,000 puppet troops and bandits in the northern Manchuria area, as well as the Japanese troops of Ito, Kato, Yoshika, Uemura, and others, totaling more than 36,000 people. In Harbin, Jiang colluded with Japanese officers Sasaki Yoshizo, Oka Sakumio, Masaaki Yoshi, and others, along with more than 1,800 Japanese soldiers, attempting to coordinate with the riot. On July 5th, Du Yuming ordered Jiang to "coordinate with the New First Army to advance into Harbin simultaneously," and informed Jiang that the New First Army would attack Harbin on August 8th. Later, because the date of the New First Army's attack was changed, and Jiang's troops, who were lurking near Harbin in preparation for the riot, lacked food and ammunition, coupled with the approaching autumn harvest making it difficult to hide, Jiang sent a letter to Du Yuming requesting permission to carry out the riot independently before the New First Army attacked, and requested air support for rocket launchers and ammunition replenishment. At the same time, he stepped up deployments, ordering his subordinates Li Huatang, Xie Wendong, Zuo Jiantang, and other bandit troops to gather in Acheng (dozens of miles southeast of Harbin), Liu Songpo's bandit troops to gather in the suburbs of Harbin, Liu Jingshan's bandit troops to gather north of the Songhua River, and Wu Junfeng's bandit troops to gather in Taipingzhuang (all of the above were puppet troops and bandits recruited by Jiang), to adopt an encirclement of Harbin.

　　Inside the city of Harbin, Jiang closely contacted his confidants, actively carrying out the riot, and secretly scouted the locations of Harbin's banks, treasuries, companies, granaries, clothing factories, armories, motorcade, oil depots, and other material concentration points, as well as the residences of Harbin's military and government leaders. He also ordered Japanese officer Sasaki Yoshizo to prepare the chest and arm badges of the 27th Army and the yellow cloth banners of the Buddhist Association, preparing to launch the riot on August 28th. However, Jiang's conspiracy was discovered by the people of Harbin and the public security organs. On the 26th, two days before his scheduled riot, the case was cracked, Jiang and all his riot organization personnel were arrested, and incriminating documents and evidence were seized. After a short period of interrogation, the Harbin military and government authorities organized a special court, held a public trial in Harbin on the 9th with the participation of more than 400 representatives from all walks of life, and exhibited all the incriminating evidence. The presiding judge, Shao Ziren, presided over the trial. Chief Prosecutor Zhou Zhan listed the criminal facts and evidence of each defendant and filed a public prosecution. The awakened defendants and murderers Yang Zaoshun, Yang Kuiwu, Li Fengxiang, Li Xiujian, Sun Zhanren, Tang Chuichou, Tian Jiuyang, and others, listed facts and made accusations in court. The trial lasted a total of eight hours. Because the evidence was conclusive and undeniable, the rebels confessed to their crimes. The special court sentenced the three rebels to death in accordance with the law and based on public opinion, and executed them by firing squad on the 10th. The people were all elated.
