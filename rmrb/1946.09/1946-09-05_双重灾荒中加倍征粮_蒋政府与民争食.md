　　Doubled Grain Tax Amidst Dual Disasters
    Chiang Government Seizes Food from the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st dispatch] Shanghai News: A Reuters dispatch from the 17th states: It is estimated here that the actual grain tax collected in the Nationalist-controlled areas this year amounts to 117,567,700 dan (a unit of dry measure), of which more than 71 million dan belong to the provincial authorities, and the remaining 40 million dan are all sent to the Nationalist Central Government. The people of Sichuan bear the most, totaling 11 million dan. Hunan, the hardest hit by disasters, also reaches 6.2 million dan, Zhejiang 6 million dan, Jiangsu 5.7 million dan, Guangxi 4.7 million dan, Henan 3.8 million dan, Shaanxi 9 million dan, Taiwan 2.3 million dan, and the northeastern provinces a total of 30 million dan. Over the years, the Nationalist government's plundering of people's grain has reached the point of exhaustion. Last year, the grain tax collected in kind was more than 59 million dan, and only more than 21 million dan were received by January of this year. The people have no surplus grain. This year, in the midst of dual disasters, the grain tax has doubled compared to last year, and the accumulated grain debts from previous years are still being recovered. As a result, the grain shortage in the Nationalist-controlled areas and the disaster situation, including over 100 million disaster victims, have become more serious.

　　双重灾荒中加倍征粮
    蒋政府与民争食
    【新华社延安一日电】沪讯：路透社十七日电称：此间估计本年田赋征实在全国民党区共约一万万一千七百五十六万七千担，其中七千一百余万担归各省当局，余四千余万担全部解送国民党中央政府。四川人民所负担的最多，计一千一百万担，受灾最重的湖南亦达六百二十万担，浙江六百万担，江苏五百七十万担，广西四百七十万担，河南三百八十万担，陕西九百万担，台湾二百三十万担，东北各省共三千万担。历年来国民党政府搜刮人民的粮食已至山穷水尽，去年田赋征实五千九百余万担，至今年一月份才收到二千一百余万担，人民已无余粮。今年在双灾荒之中，征粮竟为上年之二倍，且历年积欠粮食仍在追缴，结果国民党区的粮荒和包括一万万以上灾民的灾情更加严重。
