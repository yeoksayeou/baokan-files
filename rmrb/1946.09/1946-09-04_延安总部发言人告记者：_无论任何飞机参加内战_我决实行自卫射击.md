Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th - When reporters asked what attitude the Chinese Communist military would take regarding the discovery in various places of civil aviation aircraft being forced by the Chiang government to engage in military transport for the civil war, the Yan'an Headquarters spokesperson said: "We have already ordered the shooting down of all aircraft carrying military supplies or troops or officers to the front lines of the civil war for the purpose of attacking the Liberated Areas, because regardless of their origin, these aircraft are participating in combat actions. For the sake of self-defense, we must implement this measure." The spokesperson said: "In any case, we will not harm any pilots or other personnel in the shot-down aircraft. If they are injured, we will do our best to treat them. We feel very sorry for all air force personnel forced to participate in the civil war, and we especially sympathize with civil aviation flight personnel forced to engage in military transport." Therefore, we oppose the use of any air force in the civil war and advocate placing the air force under the administration of the Beiping Executive Headquarters. In order to minimize the unnecessary sacrifice of flight personnel and to protect the survival and future of China's nascent civil aviation industry, we especially resolutely oppose the Chiang government's absurd measure of forcibly requisitioning civil aviation aircraft to engage in the civil war.

　　延安总部发言人告记者：
    无论任何飞机参加内战
    我决实行自卫射击
    【新华社延安三十日电】在记者问以各地发现民航机被蒋政府勒令从事内战的军运，中共军对此将取何态度时，延安总部发言人说：“为着进攻解放区的目的而载运军火或军队或军官到内战前线的一切飞机，我们都已下令射击，因为这些飞机无论来源如何，都是参与了作战行为，我们为了自卫，必须实行这个步骤。”发言人说：“无论如何，我们对于被击落飞机中的一切驾驶员和其他人员都不会伤害，如果受伤，我们当尽力救治，我们对于一切被从迫事内战的空军人员都感觉非常惋惜，对于被迫从事军运的民航机飞行人员尤其同情。”因此，我们反对在内战中使用任何空军，主张把空军放在北平执行部管理之下。而为了尽量减少飞行人员的无谓牺牲，为了保护幼稚的中国民航事业的生存前途，我们尤其坚决反对蒋政府强迫征用民航机从事内战的荒谬措施。
