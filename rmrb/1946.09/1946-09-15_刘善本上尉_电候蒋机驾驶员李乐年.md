　　Captain Liu Shanben
　　Sends Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek's Pilot Li Lenian
　　[Our Newspaper] Yan'an – Captain Liu Shanben of the Air Force, upon hearing that Nationalist aircraft pilots Li Lenian and Yu Ruifu were forced to land in our Yubei Liberated Area on August 19th due to adverse weather conditions and were rescued by the military and civilians of the Liberated Area, sent a telegram of greetings. The original telegram is as follows:

　　To Lieutenants Li Lenian and Yu Ruifu: Today, I saw in the newspaper that you were forced to land in Yubei due to bad weather. Fortunately, you are both unharmed, which is gratifying. I am a graduate of the 8th class of the Air Force Academy and originally served in the 35th Squadron of the 8th Group in Shanghai. I returned to the country last September. Because we oppose the civil war and are unwilling to use foreign weapons to slaughter our fellow countrymen, we flew a "B-24" aircraft to Yan'an on June 16th. In your large group stationed in Xi'an, there are 8th class classmates such as Li Jiwu, Wu Zhenyou, Liang Dajia, and Wang Yanxuan. Please extend my greetings to them. In Yan'an, there are also classmates from our class, Zhang Shouyi, and other Air Force personnel such as Tang Shiyao, Tang Yuwen, Li Rong＠, and Jiang Huanzhang. They all asked me to extend their greetings to you and are happy that you are both unharmed.

　　Sincerely,
　　Liu Shanben, September 4th.

    电候蒋机驾驶员李乐年
    【本报讯】延安刘善本空军上尉，顷闻八月十九日因气候恶劣，被迫降落于我豫北解放区之国民党飞机驾驶员李乐年、俞瑞甫被解放区军民救护，特电问候，原电如下：
    李乐年、俞瑞甫中尉钧鉴：今日见报载兄等因天气恶劣迫降于豫北，所幸身体无恙，颇堪庆幸。弟乃空军官校第八期毕业，原服务于上海第八大队三十五中队，系去年九月返国。弟等因反对内战，不愿用外国武器屠杀本国同胞，于六月十六日架“Ｂ２４”式机飞延。驻西安贵大队有八期同学李继武、吴振犹、梁大嘉、王延铉等，有便希代为问候。在延尚有本期同学张受益及其他空军人员唐世耀、唐玉文、李嵘＠、江焕章等，他们都嘱笔问候兄等，庆幸你们的身体无恙。
    弟刘善本九月四日。
