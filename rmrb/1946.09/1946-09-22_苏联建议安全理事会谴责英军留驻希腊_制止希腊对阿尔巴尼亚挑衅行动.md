　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: New York dispatch: The Ukrainian government's accusation against Greece for threatening Balkan peace has been under discussion in the Security Council for days. At the meeting on the 16th, the Dutch representative, Kerstens, proposed submitting the Ukrainian accusation to a special committee for review. Ukrainian representative Manuilsky said: The Dutch representative is amending the UN Charter, and the Soviet representative also opposes this delaying plan. On the 17th, the Soviet representative proposed that the United Nations condemn the British military presence in Greece and force Greece to stop its provocative actions against Albania. Before the Greek government implements the Security Council's decision, the issue should remain on the agenda. At the meeting that day, Polish representative Lange, who was relieved of his duties as chairman, stated: The case brought forward by the Ukrainian representative has sufficient evidence to prove that Greece is a threat to Balkan peace. Lange said: In Europe, the shadow of Munich still looms. He cited U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Germany on the 6th of this month as an example, pointing out that Byrnes's attempt to cancel the agreement on Poland's western border in the Potsdam Agreement "proves that the shadow of Munich is directly threatening our country (Poland). But we remember the painful experience of Czechoslovakia's submission in 1938 to the Munich policy, and we will not yield." Poland supports keeping the Greek issue on the agenda. Before the adjournment, the Greek representative defended the visit of the U.S. ship "Roosevelt" to Greece.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th: New York dispatch: The United Nations Economic and Social Council, after reconvening on the 10th after three months, has had as its main agenda item the discussion of Yugoslavia's request for the United States to return Yugoslav ships illegally detained by the authorities in the U.S.-occupied zones of Germany and Austria, as well as international refugee relief issues. At the meeting on the 11th, when discussing Yugoslavia's request for the U.S. to return the detained ships, the U.S. representative stated that they were unwilling to discuss it alone, but were willing to discuss the issue of freedom of navigation on the Danube River. Yugoslav representative Krasojević replied that the Danube issue is a legal issue and has nothing to do with the return of Yugoslav ships. The Soviet representative supported the Yugoslav representative's opinion. During the discussion, the French and Greek representatives questioned whether the issue of returning ships was within the scope of the council's authority. The issue of the International Refugee Organization was the theme of the council's discussions on the 14th and 16th. At the meeting on the 11th, UNRRA Director La Guardia delivered a speech, advocating immediate action to take care of homeless refugees. This issue includes the scope of work of the International Refugee Organization, financial allocation, resettlement and repatriation of refugees. It is said that the vast majority of these refugees are exiles from Poland, the Baltic states, and Yugoslavia, who, because of their hatred of the new democracy and socialist development in their home countries, are still being supported by Britain and the United States as tools for British and American imperialists to oppose the new democratic countries of Europe. During the discussion, the United States advocated finding ways to resettle these refugees, especially political refugees, in other countries, rather than sending them back to their homeland, while the Soviet Union strongly advocated sending them back home, arguing that those who do not want to return home are not worthy of being helped. The meeting on the 16th still had no result.

　　苏联建议安全理事会谴责英军留驻希腊
    制止希腊对阿尔巴尼亚挑衅行动
    【新华社延安十九日电】纽约讯：乌克兰政府对希腊威胁巴尔干和平的控诉，连日来仍在安理会讨论中。十六日会议上，荷兰代表克里芬斯提议，将乌克兰的控诉提交特别委员会审查。乌代表曼努意斯基说：荷兰代表是修改联合国宪章，苏代表也反对这个拖延计划。十七日，苏代表提出建议，要求联合国谴责英军驻希，并强迫希腊停止对阿尔巴尼亚的挑衅行动，在希腊政府尚未执行安理会决定前，问题应保留在议程上。当天会上解脱了主席职务的波兰代表兰吉发言说：乌代表所提出的案件，有充分的证据，证明希腊是对巴尔干和平的威胁。兰氏说：在欧洲，目前慕尼黑的阴影依然笼罩着。他以美国务卿贝纳斯本月六日在德国的演说作为例子，指出贝纳斯取消波茨顿协定中关于波兰西部边界协议的企图，“证明慕尼黑的阴影正直接威胁我国（波兰）。但我们记得，捷克屈服于一九三八年，慕尼黑政策的惨痛经验，我们将不屈服。”波兰赞成将希腊问题保留在议程上。休会前，希腊代表则为美舰“罗斯福号”访问希腊作辩护。
    【新华社延安十八日电】纽约讯：三个月的联合国经济社会理事会，于十日复会后，连日来主要议题为讨论南斯拉夫要求美国发还德奥美占领区当局非法扣留南国船只问题及国际难民救济问题。十一日会议上，讨论南国要美发还被扣留船只要求时，美国代表表示不愿单独讨论，而愿讨论多瑙河的航运自由问题。南国代表克拉索维奇回答说：多瑙河问题是法律问题，与发还南国船只一事无关。苏联代表支持南代表的意见。讨论中，法国与希腊代表则怀疑发还船只问题是否是理事会的权力范围。国际难民机构问题，为理事会十四、十六两日讨论之主题，十一日会议上，联总署长拉瓜第亚发表演说，主张立即采取行动，以照顾无家可归的难民。这一问题中，包括国际难民组织的工作范围、财政分配、难民的移居及遣送回国等。据说此等难民绝大部分为波兰、波罗的海各国与南斯拉夫的流亡者，这些人因仇视祖国的新民主主义与社会主义的发展，迄今受着英美豢养，为英美帝国主义者进行反对新民主主义欧洲各国的工具之一。讨论中，美国主张设法使这些难民，尤其是政治难民移居他国，而不送回故土，而苏联则力主将他们遣送回国，不愿回国者就不值得受帮助。会议十六日仍无结果。
