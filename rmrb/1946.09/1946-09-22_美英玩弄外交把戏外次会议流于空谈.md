Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: TASS reports: The Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting, which was discussing amendments and proposals to the peace treaty, has stalled due to the tactics employed by the US and British delegations. After reviewing the voluminous two-volume set of amendments, the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting reached agreements on certain issues and decided not to support 62 amendments in the various committees of the conference. These amendments or proposals contained nothing new, but were merely designed to confuse and entangle issues. They were mainly put forward by delegations from British dominions and certain South American countries in an attempt to obstruct certain clauses in the draft peace treaty. Although these clauses were adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers, they were not very convenient for the US and Britain. The passage of these clauses was a concession that the US and British delegations demanded from the Soviet Union at the Council of Foreign Ministers. Bound by their promises, the US and British delegations could not propose amendments at the peace conference, so they instructed Australia, Brazil, and other countries to submit a large number of amendments at the conference, while the US and Britain took a very negative attitude towards this activity. On the other hand, they were reaping their own benefits. At the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting, the British and American representatives played many tricks to support those amendments that violated the draft peace treaty. They might say that this was not an amendment at all, but a new proposal that had been agreed upon at the Council of Foreign Ministers. When their trick was exposed on the spot, pointing out that this suggestion was actually amending or simply abolishing the resolution passed by the Council of Foreign Ministers, they found another way out, saying that these suggestions had not been discussed at all in the Council of Foreign Ministers, and therefore were not subject to any obligations in this regard. All of this created considerable difficulties for the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting, with hours and hours wasted on empty talk and discussion on this unlimited topic: what is the difference between an amendment and a proposal, how to distinguish them, new proposals and old agreements, and so on.

　　美英玩弄外交把戏外次会议流于空谈
    【新华社延安十九日电】塔斯社报导：研讨和约修正案与建议案的四强外长助理会议，由于美英代表团玩弄策略而停滞不前。外次会议在审查浩繁达两巨册之修正案后，曾在某些问题上达到协议，决定和会各委员会中不支持六十二条修正案，这些修正案或建议没有什么新的东西，只是一些惑乱人心和纠缠不清的问题而已，主要为英自治领及某些南美国家代表团所提出的，是企图阻碍和约草案中的某些条款。这些条款虽为外长会议所通过，但对美英两国不太方便。这些条款的通过，是美英代表团在外长会议上要求苏联的让步，美英代表团为自己的诺言所约束，不能在和会上提出修正案，便指使澳、巴西等国来在和会上大量提出修正案，而美英方面对此种活动则是取消极态度。另一方面却在大捞其本，在外长助理会议上，英美代表为了支持那些违反和约草案的修正案，玩弄了许多花样，他们可以说这根本不是修正案，而是外长会议上曾取得协议的新建议。当他们的诡计被人当场揭穿，指明此一建议实际上是修正或干脆废除外长会议通过的决议时，他们又找到另一条逃路，说这些建议是外长会议中根本未讨论过的，因此在这方面不受义务之限制。所有这些给外长助理会议造成了相当大的困难，一小时又一小时地浪费在空议和讨论这个毫无限制的题目上：即修正案和建议案的区别是什么，如何区别，新的建议和旧的协议等等。
