　　Review of the Hebei-Henan-August Mass Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Henan Branch
    Following the Hebei-Henan Regional Party Committee's self-criticism on July 13th and a renewed deployment of the mass movement, the Regional Party Committee issued another call on August 8th, demanding that the entire Party unite from top to bottom, wholeheartedly and fully support and unleash the peasant emancipation movement. Upon receiving this call, the entire Party immediately responded. The Administrative Office promptly announced detailed and specific policies, the Military Region issued instructions for the troops to participate in and support the mass movement, and the Hebei-Henan Daily also published an editorial at the same time. This call stirred the enthusiasm of every cadre in the region. Comrades from the aforementioned organs all hoped to be sent to the countryside, while comrades from the old areas eagerly wished to go to the new areas. In late July, peasant emancipation teams began to go to the countryside in succession. The Regional Party Committee extracted more than 200 cadres from the Party School, and the first, fourth, and fifth sub-districts transferred more than 500 cadres to the border areas. The third sub-district organized a large emancipation team of more than 1,000 people to go to various counties, and each county also organized emancipation teams of 20 to 100 people to go to various villages. A 50-person emancipation team from Xingtai Northern University arrived in Nanhe, and teachers and students from the Puyun Middle School also went to the countryside in teams to study. Soldiers squeezed time from combat and training to participate in the mass movement in their stationed areas. Our army stationed in Linzhang also dispatched a company of people to help the peasants emancipate themselves. At the end of August, the leading organs organized another large team of more than 100 people, including several important cadres, each with the same heart: "We will not return until the peasants there are thoroughly emancipated."
    The emancipation teams arrived in the newly liberated areas one after another. Under the unified leadership of the local authorities, they cooperated with local cadres to launch a vigorous struggle in some areas and deepened the struggle in the newly initiated areas and areas where activities such as increasing wages, redeeming land, and reducing rent and interest had been carried out in the past. In villages that had not yet been mobilized, hired, tenant, poor, and middle peasants also responded to our call for exposing and accusing traitors and thoroughly emancipating themselves, actively uniting all peasants. Therefore, this type of area developed more rapidly than the border areas. Currently, development is generally carried out from points to areas, such as in Yuanchao, Guanxian, Wuxun, Gucheng, Wucheng, Feixiang, Yongnian, Ningnan, and Nanhe counties.
    In the newly liberated areas in the border regions, such as Gaotang, Xiajin, Enxian, Pingyuan, Linzhang, Weixian, Cheng'an, and Yongzhi counties, the Kuomintang special agents, puppet bandits, and traitors, along with feudal landlords and local bullies, still maintained a brutal feudal rule over the peasants. They spread rumors, assassinated people, and the Kuomintang army constantly coordinated with the puppet bandits to harass the area. Therefore, the masses had many concerns and dared not approach us. After investigation and research, and understanding the masses' concerns and urgent demands, we believe that we should first disarm the special agents and puppet personnel and arm the masses. In Gaotang, Enxian, Xiajin, Linzhang and other counties, on the one hand, our regular army and public security teams cooperated with the militia to clear out special agents and bandits, and on the other hand, we announced the lenient policy of our government. More than 600 special agents, puppet soldiers and puppet personnel in Enxian and Gaotang, who had been deceived, immediately repented and surrendered to our government. The masses have experienced the importance of armed forces. Xiajin established a joint defense, and Linzhang also organized a district joint defense command. Only with the suppression of special agents and the establishment of mass armed forces could social order be stabilized and the anti-traitor liquidation movement begin to enter an in-depth stage of preparation. Enxian, Xiajin, Gaotang, Weixian, and Linzhang have begun a networking movement, but in the most marginal areas, such as the seventh and eighth districts of Pingyuan and Gaotang, and the southern part of Linzhang, they are still engaged in fierce armed struggles with the invaders, and there are still many difficulties in mobilizing the masses to emancipate themselves.
    In the old liberated areas where the peasant emancipation movement has been launched, on one hand, pending cases are resolved, and on the other hand, production is carried out (not yet forming a movement). Leaders have summarized that in the mass movement of the past year, only a few counties, such as Jize, have eliminated the abject poor. Investigations in Nangong, Guangzong, Julu, Ningnan, and Baixiang, five counties in the fourth sub-district, show that the number of abject poor has risen by 50% to 90%, and the number of poor peasants has risen by about 30%. Feudal landlords still maintain 50% or so of their economic and political advantages. The number of peasant households participating in the organization is 50% to 80%, and the masses' awareness has been improved compared to the past. However, there are still some internal contradictions, such as the need to solve problems such as the actual distribution of fruits of victory. In short, the masses in the old areas need to continue to be thoroughly mobilized on the one hand, and the outstanding issues left over from the past need to be resolved on the other.
    How to open up the situation in the new areas? First, it is necessary to conduct detailed and in-depth investigation and research to understand the concerns and urgent demands of the masses, and then start to mobilize. Second, in general, it is necessary to start with anti-espionage. The ringleaders of the traitors and special agents who have committed heinous crimes should be punished according to law, while a lenient policy should be adopted towards the majority of those who have been coerced and deceived, and efforts should be made to win them over to repent and start anew. Third, launch a publicity offensive to support the masses. Anti-traitor liquidation should be regarded by the masses as reasonable and legal, and the government should post announcements to support the peasants. Fourth, in the newly launched areas, it is necessary to fully promote the existing activists, carry out networking, and organize movements to achieve rapid mobilization and a grand scale. Fifth, according to the experience of Linqing, in the anti-traitor liquidation in the city, first, the time of the poor citizens should be taken care of so as not to delay their business, and second, it should be publicized and implemented that industrial and commercial capitalists should not be struggled against, so that industrialists and businessmen can operate with peace of mind and invest in the movement.
    In the leadership methods of boldly mobilizing the masses, county and district cadres have initially explored experience, and the main thing is to master four links. First, affirm a concept in the minds of cadres, that is, the masses can liberate themselves, not afraid of the masses making mistakes, and if they make mistakes, they can come again, and boldly hand over the policies to the masses. Second, discover and cultivate activists to become true mass leaders. Their most important conditions are to maintain close contact with the masses and always maintain a democratic style. Third, letting go is by no means letting things take their course. On the contrary, it is necessary to deeply understand the situation and grasp the changes, but not to take over and interfere. Enlighten the masses (generally through activists) to examine themselves, master policies themselves, and the representative meeting makes resolutions and sets disciplines, and so on. Fourth, create a base point to promote the general.
    According to the above situation and experience, under the guidance of implementing the policy of being bold and letting go, the new areas, especially the border areas, still need to continue to deeply understand the situation, grasp the thoughts and demands of the masses, and on the other hand, carry out networking and brewing from points to areas, from one village to a group of villages. In the most marginal districts and villages, armed struggle cannot be relaxed. In the newly launched new areas, existing activists should be fully promoted, the movement should be carried out quickly and on a large scale, and this type of area should be used as a base point to create experience, as Yongzhi in the first sub-district is an example.
    The old areas should immediately prepare for rent reduction. First, investigate and study how the masses are mobilized in terms of economy, organization, and politics, and deeply familiarize themselves with the different situations of each county, district, and village. Secondly, resolve the outstanding issues, and quickly and reasonably deal with the fruits of victory, compensating the middle peasants for the losses they suffered in the past during the distribution of the fruits of victory. (In villages where the fruits of victory have already been distributed, compensation can be made in the next liquidation movement.) At the same time, carry out internal democratic education and criticism to achieve further unity of the broad masses of peasants, and then carry out thorough liquidation in different ways according to the specific conditions of each county, district, and village.

　　冀南八月群运回顾
    新华社冀南分社
    七月十三日区党委检讨，并重新布置群运后，八月八日区党委再度发出号召，要求全党上下一致，一心一意全力支持与放手发动农民的翻身运动。这一号召传达后，全党立即响应，行署当即公布详密具体的政策，军区颁布部队参加及支持群运的指示，冀南日报亦于同时发表社论；这一号召激动了全区每个干部的热情，上述机关的同志均盼望着被派下乡，老区同志则热望着到新区去。七月下旬，农民翻身队即开始纷纷下乡，区党委抽出党校干部二百余人，一、四、五分区抽调干部五百余人，分赴边陲。三分区组织一千余人的翻身大队分赴各县，各县亦组织二三十人到百数十人的翻身队分赴各村，邢台北方大学五十人的翻身队到达南和、滏运中学师生亦结队下乡学习，子弟兵团挤出战斗、训练之暇参加驻地群运，驻临漳我军也抽派了一连人帮助农民翻身，八月底领导机关又组织了一个百余人的大队，包括若干重要干部，每个人都怀着同一的心“不帮那里的农民翻透身，誓不回来”。
    翻身队先后到达了新解放区，在地方的统一领导下，配合地方干部已在部分地区掀起轰轰烈烈的斗争，并在已初步发动的新区和过去进行过增资赎地减租减息等工作的地区深入斗争；过去尚未运动过的村庄，雇、佃、贫、中农亦已首先响应我反奸控诉彻底翻身的号召，积极串连全体农民，因此这种地区较边沿区开展的迅速。目前一般是由点到面开展，如元朝、冠县、武训、故城、武城、肥乡、永年、宁南、南和等县。
    在边沿地区的新解放区，如高唐、夏津、恩县、平原、临漳、魏县、成安、永智等县，解除顽伪武装不久，国民党特务、伪匪、汉奸与封建地主豪绅恶霸仍保持着几位一体的对农民残酷的封建统治，造谣暗杀，加之国民党军队不断配合伪匪进扰，因此群众顾虑甚多，不敢接近我们。经过调查研究，了解群众的顾虑与迫切要求后，我们认为首先应该解除特务伪员的武装，把群众武装起来。高唐、恩县、夏津、临漳等县一方面我正规军、公安队配合民兵清扫特务匪杂，一方面宣布我政府之宽大政策，恩县、高唐被骗特务分子、伪军伪员六百余名当即向我政府悔过自新。群众已体验到武装的重要，夏津建立联防，临漳也组织起区联防指挥部。由于对特务的镇压与群众武力的建立，社会秩序才安定下来，反奸清算运动开始步入深入的酝酿阶段。恩县、夏津、高唐、魏县、临漳已开始串连运动，但在最边沿地区、如平原、高唐七八区、临漳的南部，仍然与进犯者作着激烈的武装斗争，发动群众翻身目前尚有很多困难。
    在老解放区已发动过农民翻身的县份，一面解决悬案，一面进行生产，（尚未形成运动）领导上总结一年群运中、只有个别县份如鸡泽消灭了赤贫，四分区南宫、广宗、巨鹿、宁南、柏乡等五个县的调查，赤贫上升百分之五十到九十，贫农上升百分之三十左右，封建地主尚有百分之五十上下保持着经济与政治上的优势。农民参加组织的户数，为百分之五十至八十，群众觉悟已较前提高。但还有些内部矛盾，如果实分配等急待解决。总之，老区群众一方面需要继续彻底发动，一方面需要解决过去遗留下的悬案。
    新区的局面怎样打开的？首先必须作详密深入的调查研究，了解群众的顾虑与迫切的要求，然后着手发动。第二、一般的是要从反特开始，对罪大恶极的汉奸特务头子依法惩处，对多数胁从受骗分子则采取宽大政策，争取其悔过自新。第三、开展宣传攻势，给群众撑腰，反奸清算做到群众认为合理合法，政府张贴布告支持农民。第四、在已初步发动的新区，要充分推动现有积极分子，开展串连，组织运动，做到动员迅速，规模宏伟。第五、根据临清的经验，城市反奸清算，一要照顾贫苦市民的时间，不耽误他们的买卖，二要宣传与贯彻不斗工商业资本家，工商业者才能安心经营并投入运动之中。
    在放手发动群众的领导方法上，县区干部初步摸索出了经验，主要的要掌握四个环节。第一、在干部思想上肯定一个观念，即群众自己能解放自己，不怕群众出错，错了另来，把政策大胆的交给群众。第二、发现培养积极分子，使之成为真正的群众领袖，他们最重要的条件是密切联系群众，永远保持民主作风。第三、放手决不是放任自流，相反的要深入了解情况，掌握变化，但不是包办干涉。启发群众（一般是通过积极分子）自己检讨，自己掌握政策，代表会作决议定纪律等等。第四、创造基点推动一般。
    根据上述情况与经验，在贯彻大胆放手的方针下，新区特别是边沿区还需要一方面继续深入的了解情况，掌握群众的思想与要求，一方面由点到面，由一村到一片村的串连酝酿。在最边沿的区村还不能放松武装斗争。在已初步发动的新区，应充分推动现有的积极分子，迅速的大规模的开展运动，并以此种地区为基点创造经验，如一分区永智就是范例。
    老区要立即作查减准备工作。首先调查研究，究竟群众在经济上组织上政治上发动的程度如何，深入的熟悉各县各区各村的不同情况。其次解决悬案，迅速与合理的处理果实，在分配果实中补偿过去中农受到的损失。（在果实已经分配的村庄，可在下次清算运动中来补偿）同时开展内部民主教育与批评，达到广大农民的进一步团结，然后根据各县区村的具体情况进行不同方式的彻底的清算。
