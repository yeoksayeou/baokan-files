　　Replenishing Heavy Losses in the Civil War
    KMT Expands Conscription
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd—The Kuomintang authorities are expanding conscription in various provinces to replenish the heavy losses of their civil war troops, but this has been met with strong resistance from the people. According to the Peiping World Daily and the Tianjin Yishi Daily and other reports, the Chiang government plans to initially conscript 80,000 people in the Northeast. Shenyang City has been allocated a quota of 6,500 people in two phases. The people of the city are fleeing en masse, with some families even relocating. Since June 23rd, the conscription has not reached half of the target by early August, so the second phase of conscription began on August 9th. People in Suizhong and other places are passively resisting by fleeing. In response to the serious phenomenon of escape, the Northeast Headquarters formulated the so-called "Ten-Household Joint Responsibility Law" last month, stipulating "Each household head must jointly guarantee at least five households to fill out a ten-household joint responsibility pledge," consisting of six articles, to prohibit people from fleeing. Even monks in various temples are included. It is also stipulated that "Violations of the above provisions will be dealt with in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Interference with Military Service." However, the people are still not enlisting. An old woman whose sick son was conscripted and whose request for exemption was denied, committed suicide in the Shenyang Social Bureau, causing widespread sympathy in society. In Chongqing: According to the New China Daily, police chiefs, etc., began investigating strong young men throughout the city at the beginning of last month, and ordered householders to prevent suitable strong men from leaving casually, so that they could be conscripted at any time. It is reported that the method of conscripting strong men has been drafted, requiring one strong man from every ten households, and about ten or more people from each bao (neighborhood unit). Households without suitable strong men must pay 50,000 yuan. Seventy-two students from the Chongqing Nursery were even conscripted into the 45th and 41st artillery regiments at the beginning of last month. Most of these students were young children aged thirteen or fourteen to fifteen or sixteen. Zeng Fande and ten other children under the age of sixteen from the nursery issued an appeal against being conscripted into the army.

　　补充内战惨重损失
    国民党扩大征兵
    【新华社延安二日电】国民党当局在各省扩大征兵，以补充其内战兵员的惨重损失；但遭到人民强烈抵抗。据北平世界日报及天津益世报等透露，蒋政府预定在东北初期抽征八万名，沈阳市两次配额共六千五百名，该市人民纷纷逃避，并有举家迁移者。以自从六月二十三日到八月初旬抽征未达半数，乃于八月九日开始第二期征兵。绥中等地人民以逃走为消极抵抗。东北行营以逃亡现象之严重，复于上月制定所谓“十家连坐法”，规定“各户户长联合保内至少五户共填十家连坐切结”等共六条，禁止人民逃亡。甚至各寺庙僧人亦包括在内。并规定“违犯上述条款时照妨害兵役治罪条例办理”。但人民仍不应征，曾有一老妇因病子被征请免未准，而碰死于沈阳社会局内，引起社会广泛同情。在重庆方面：据新华日报载，上月初已由警察甲长等开始调查全市的壮丁，并饬各户户主令适役壮丁不能随便离开，以便随时征调。闻征集壮丁办法已拟定每十家出壮丁一人，每保约十余人。如无适役壮丁之住户，每户须出洋五万元。重庆保育院学生有七十二人于上月初竟亦被征到炮兵四十五、四十一团当兵，该生等大多为十三四岁至十五六岁之幼童，该院曾凡德等十一名十六岁以下的儿童发出呼吁信，反对被征当兵。
