　　Qixian County City Sees the Light Again
    Ding Man
    On August 26th of last year, our army liberated Qixian County City from the enemy. More than 20,000 citizens and hundreds of thousands of people outside the city enjoyed a little over a month of happy days, before being invaded and occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek army's 68th and 55th divisions.
    After the Chiang Kai-shek army entered the city, they demolished many houses and rebuilt them into military strongholds. Moreover, exorbitant taxes and heavy burdens made it impossible for more than 50 percent of the citizens to make a living. Mr. Guo of × department store said: "Chief Zhu of the Fourth Army (New Fourth Army) bid us farewell in tears, and we, the people, sent Chief Zhu out of the city in tears." After the Chiang Kai-shek army entered the city, they treated the people even more fiercely and viciously than the Japanese. A folk song circulating among the masses goes: "First eat the duck, then eat the chicken, and take away the good stuff before leaving." An old lady in Beimenli said, "Not to mention the good stuff, they even snatched the broom from my house." An old scholar from Qi Wangji pasted a couplet on his door during the New Year this year, which read: "Fined twenty-eight thousand to bid farewell to the old year, only five sheng and six he to celebrate the New Year." There is also a song that is very popular, which goes: "The Kuomintang army battalion commander watches the opera, the Fourth Army (New Fourth Army) battalion commander plows the fields." The people's love and hate are strongly expressed.
    All the businesses in the city were not allowed to open in the morning, and had to sweep the streets. Children were not allowed to play on the streets. Since the beginning of summer, no one in the city dared to go shirtless and cool off at their doorstep, because according to the regulations of the Chiang Kai-shek government, this was unhygienic and detrimental to public appearance.
    On the night of the 15th, the sound of gunfire from the People's Liberation Army rang out outside Qixian County City. The people in the city secretly prayed for regaining liberation. After a fierce battle, Chiang Kai-shek's invading army was finally driven out of the city.
    The next morning, the citizens stood in line on the clean streets to welcome them. The tables along the road were filled with cigarettes and tea, and men, women, old and young, nodded respectfully to their liberators—the Eighth Route Army.
    All the businesses in the city resumed normal operation. The owner of a certain bathhouse shouted, "Comrades! You've worked hard, come in and take a bath, it's free today!" On the street, people scrambled to see the proclamations of the democratic government and the city defense garrison headquarters. The Jilu Yu Daily and various leaflets were snatched up as soon as they were brought in.
    In the afternoon, the democratic government convened a representative meeting of more than 2,000 citizens. At the meeting, the people recounted the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek army. A representative of the merchants said, "Our business is simply for Chiang Kai-shek, we can't spend the money we earn ourselves, it's all paid in taxes." A representative of the farmers said, "We really can't afford to farm. Others farm to feed people, but we farm to feed the land. The grain we harvest is all used as military grain."
    The democratic government cares about the hardships of the people. After the meeting, it immediately started to carry out relief work. On the afternoon of the 17th, groups of poor people received wheat from the democratic government. They said happily, "The Eighth Route Army loves us like our own mothers, and they come here to help us first; the Central Army is a disaster army, they have abused us to the point where we can't live." The democratic government used 50,000 jin of wheat to provide relief to the poor people in the city. Those residents who suffered losses and casualties in the battle also received compensation and pensions.
    The democratic government called on the citizens to dismantle the military strongholds built by the Chiang Kai-shek army. County Magistrate Chen told everyone, "We have food to eat and places to live. Let's dismantle the harmful strongholds and build comfortable houses." More than 20,000 citizens quickly demolished the bunkers and flattened the city walls. They said excitedly, "The bunkers are demolished, and the bricks and stones can be used to build houses. The city walls and moats are flattened, so we can grow grain."
    Now, the representatives of the chamber of commerce have held a meeting, and the merchants are preparing their own organization. More than a dozen educators from primary and secondary schools have asked the democratic government to help restore the schools as soon as possible. The petty officials who used to work in the Chiang Kai-shek government organs are also working as usual under the leadership of the democratic government.
    For nearly a year, the deserted streets have seen for the first time groups of three or five children dressed in colorful clothes, following their mothers to play on the streets. The twice-liberated Qixian County City is showing a fresh, lively, and free atmosphere.

　　重见光明的杞县城
    丁曼
    去年八月二十六日，我军从敌人手里解放了杞县城，两万多市民与城外数十万人民只过了月余的幸福日子，就被蒋军六十八、五十五两个师侵占去。
    蒋军进城后，把许多房舍都拆毁，改筑了军事堡垒，而且苛捐杂税，重重负担已使百分之五十以上的市民，生活没有办法。×百货商店的郭先生说：“四军（新四军）的朱区长洒泪向我们告别，我们百姓哭着将朱区长送出城。”蒋军进城后，对待人民却比日本人还要凶狠、毒辣。群众中流传着的民谣是“先吃鸭，后吃鸡，临走拉着好东西”。北门里，一个老大娘说：“不用说好东西，连俺家里扫把都给抢了去”。杞王集的一位老秀才，今年过新年时，在门上贴了一副对联，写着：“罚款两万八千辞旧岁，只有五升六合过新年。”还有一首流行得很广的歌子，唱道：“国军营长看戏、四军（新四军）营长犁地”。人民的爱与恨，被强烈的写出来了。
    城内所有商号，早上不能营业，都得去打扫街道，小孩们也不许在街上玩，入夏以来，全城没有一个人敢光着脊梁在家门口乘凉，因为按蒋政府的规定，这都是不合卫生，有碍观瞻的。
    十五日深夜，解放军的枪声在杞县城外响开了，城里人民暗地里祈祷着重获解放，经过一场激烈之战斗，蒋介石的进犯军终于被驱逐出城。
    第二天清早，市民们在打扫得干干净净的街道上站队欢迎，路旁的桌子上，摆满了纸烟和茶水，男女老少微笑地向着自己的解放者——八路军点头致敬。
    全城商号都照常营业，某澡塘的老板人声喊叫着：“同志！你们辛苦了，进来洗个澡吧，今天免费！”大街上，人们抢着看民主政府和城防卫戍司令部的布告。冀鲁豫日报和各种传单，刚拿来，便被抢光了。
    下午，民主政府召开了两千余市民代表大会，在会议上，人民纷纷诉述蒋军的暴行，商民代表说：“我们的买卖简直是给蒋介石做的，赚的钱，自己花不上，全缴了捐税了。”农民代表说：“我们种地真种不起，人家种地是地养人，我们种地是人养地，打下的粮食，都充了军粮。”
    民主政府是关怀人民疾苦的，开会以后，马上着手进行救济工作。十七日下午，成群的贫苦人民，从民主政府那里领到了小麦，他们欢喜地说：“八路军象亲娘一样的爱护咱，来到这里先救济咱；中央军可是遭殃军，把咱们糟践得不能活。”民主政府以五万斤小麦用来救济全城的贫民，那些在战斗中遭受到损失和伤亡的居民，也同样得到赔偿和抚恤。
    民主政府号召集市民拆毁蒋军修筑的军事堡垒，陈县长告诉大家：“我们有了吃，还有住的，把害人的堡垒拆毁，修建舒适的房屋。”两万多市民很快地折毁了碉堡，平毁了城墙。他们兴奋地说：“碉堡拆掉了，砖石拿来盖房子，城墙和壕沟平毁了，好种粮食。”
    现在，商会代表开过了会，商人正筹备自己的组织，中小学十余位教育工作者要求民主政府帮助马上恢复学校，曾在蒋政府机关里面作过事的小职员，在民主政府领导下，也照旧工作着。
    将近一年来，冷落的大街上，第一次出现了三三五五穿得花花绿绿的小孩子，跟着他们的母亲来街上玩耍。第二次被解放的杞县城，一切都呈现着新鲜活泼自由的气象。
