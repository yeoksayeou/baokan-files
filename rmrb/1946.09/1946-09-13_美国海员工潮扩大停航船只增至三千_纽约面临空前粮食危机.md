　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: Washington, September 10th: The general strike of American sailors and dockworkers has not yet ended. The number of ships idled has increased to more than 3,000, and more than 5,000 ships loaded with grain and food cannot be unloaded. Union leaders condemned the government authorities, saying: The strike is only due to the "deplorable error" on the part of Washington, that is, the Wage Stabilization Board rejected the union's demand for wage increases. The demands of the maritime union leaders have gained new support from John L. Lewis, chairman of the United Mine Workers of America. Landonberg, Secretary of the Pacific Maritime Union of the American Federation of Labor, refused Truman's request to leave San Francisco for Washington to negotiate, and refused to stop the strike before negotiations. Landonberg claimed that the strike could only be stopped after the sailors received a wage increase. The Pacific Coast Maritime Unity Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations also sent a telegram to Truman, asking him to accept the wage increase request in order to end the current strike.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: United Press, New York, September 9th: New York, the largest city in the United States and the world, is facing the most serious food and industrial crisis in modern history due to the lack of resolution of the labor unrest. The supply of food and raw materials is rapidly dwindling, and companies will have to lay off workers in batches. These companies cannot obtain raw materials and cannot ship out their finished products, because not only is land transportation at a standstill, but also sea transportation is impossible. The current situation of this modern metropolis with a population of eight million is very sad.

　　美国海员工潮扩大停航船只增至三千
    纽约面临空前粮食危机
    【新华社延安十日电】华盛顿十日讯：美国海员与码头工人的总罢工，迄今未已，停航的船只增至三千余艘，另有五千余艘满载谷物食品的船不能卸货。工会领袖们谴责政府当局说：罢工仅仅是由于华府方面“可悲的错误”，即工资稳定局拒绝了工会的增资要求。海员工会领袖们的要求，已获得了矿工联合会主席路易斯的新支持。美国劳工联合会太平洋海员工会书记兰登堡拒绝杜鲁门之请，不肯离开旧金山到华盛顿去谈判，并拒绝在谈判以前停止罢工。兰氏称：只有在海员们获得增资后，罢工才能停止。产业工会联合会的太平洋岸争取海员团结委员会亦致电杜鲁门，要求他接受增资要求，以结束目前的罢工。
    【新华社延安十日电】合众社纽约九日讯：美国和世界最大的城市——纽约，由于工潮毫无解决预兆，已面临着近代史中最严重的粮食与工业危机。粮食与原料的供应正迅速锐减，各企业将不得不整批整批的解雇工人。这些企业既得不到原料，又不能将制成品运出去，因为不仅陆路交通停顿，而且海路也无法运输。这个八百万人口的近代大都会，目前的情况是很可悲的。
