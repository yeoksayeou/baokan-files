Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 5th: Comprehensive reports: According to an announcement by the Greek government, Greece held a "national referendum" on September 1st regarding the return of King George II. With the exception of one area where the results have not yet been announced, out of the remaining 1,779,924 votes, 1,135,675 voted in favor of George's return. This vote was conducted under the surveillance of fully armed royalist tanks, airplanes, and countries like Britain and the United States. Before the vote, the royalists assassinated, arrested, searched, and persecuted democrats, and purged everyone and every organization outside of the royalist party. British and American reactionaries also sent their own observation groups to "visit" the Greek sham election, with many military officers participating in the group. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch on the 29th of last month, the U.S. Department of the Army announced that 25 U.S. Army officers from the European and Mediterranean regions are currently serving as "observers" in Athens. The British destroyer HMS Chequers also docked in the port of Salonica for 36 hours. The revision of the Greek election law was actually implemented after discussions between the British and American governments. During the voting process, soldiers in the pro-royalist army voted twice each. But despite this, 521,540 votes were still against the King's return. According to the Athens republican newspaper "Eleftheria," in the few cities where fair and free voting took place, the republicans won a majority. For example, in the left-wing area of Kasaliani in Athens, 80 percent were against the dynasty, while in most other places where terror and tyranny were rampant, the royalists won a majority. After the Greek vote, Prime Minister Tsaldaris flew to London on the 3rd to arrange the King's return.

　　希腊玩弄复辟把戏
    英美支持保皇党恐怖暴政
    强迫人民“赞成”希王回国
    【新华社延安五日电】综合报导：据希腊官方宣布：希腊曾于九月一日举行的希王乔治第二返国问题的“全民投票”。投票结果除一地尚未揭晓外，其余在一百七十七万九千九百二十四票中，有一百十三万五千六百七十五票赞成乔治回国。这次投票是在保皇党的坦克、飞机等全副武装及英美等国的监视下进行的。保皇党早在投票之前，便暗杀、逮捕、搜查与迫害民主人士，清洗保皇党以外的一切人士及组织。英美反动派也派了自己的观察团去“参观”希腊的伪选，该团中并有很多军官参加。据美新闻处上月二十九日电：美陆军部宣布欧洲及地中海区之美陆军军官二十五名，现在雅典担任“旁观人”。英驱逐舰查的勒号亦曾泊在萨隆尼加港三十六小时之久。而希腊选举法的修订，竟是经过英美政府讨论后才实行的。投票进行时，亲保皇分子军队中的士兵们每人投票两次。但尽管如此，仍有五十二万一千五百四十票反对希王返国。据雅典共和派报纸“列夫特里亚”称：在少数的公平自由投票的城市中，共和派得到了多数。例如在雅典左翼区域卡沙利尼，百分之八十是反对王朝的，而在其他大多数的恐怖行为与暴虐手段公行的地方，保皇分子则获得多数。希腊投票结束后，希总理曹达利斯于三日飞伦敦安排希王回国。
