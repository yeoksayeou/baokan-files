Saluting the Taiyue Column!

The good news has arrived that on the 24th, the Taiyue Column of the Eighth Route Army annihilated the entire elite First Division of Hu Zongnan's army in the area surrounding Fushan in southern Shanxi. This is the third major victory for the Eighth Route Army in southern Shanxi, following the annihilation of two of Hu's divisions in July, the liberation of 270 *li* of the central Tongpu Railway in August, and the annihilation of over 10,000 of Yan Xishan's troops. This, along with the victorious breakthrough of the Central Plains troops, the seven victories in seven battles on the Suzhong-South front, and the annihilation of six divisions of Chiang's troops on the Longhai Railway and in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, are all glorious victories and have made indelible contributions to crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and striving for domestic peace and democracy! While joyfully celebrating, we extend our highest respect to all commanders and fighters of the Taiyue Column!

Hu Zongnan's advance into southern Shanxi was a speculative venture, attempting to replace Yan Xishan as the local emperor of Shanxi. When Hu's army set out in early July, the original plan was to open the southern section of the Tongpu Railway in three weeks, station troops in Taiyuan, and jointly attack Shangdang. Hu Zongnan overestimated his own strength and underestimated the strength of the Shanxi army and people, who have awakened unprecedentedly after eight years of war. After suffering losses of two divisions in the battle near Wenxi, Hu's army began to taste the power of the Eighth Route Army and the people of Shanxi. He was then forced to revise his original plan, postponing the opening of the Tongpu Railway to October 10th, and at the same time, he transferred troops and dispatched generals, scraping together reinforcements to a force of ten divisions, even at the expense of deploying his most elite First Division of the First Army to the front line in southern Shanxi. Due to the painful lessons of the Battle of Wenxi, although Hu's army came fiercely, its actions were very cautious, advancing steadily and consolidating each position. At this time, we once again warned Hu Zongnan not to try to steal a chicken only to lose the bait; the words were still ringing in our ears when the elite First Division of Hu's army was completely annihilated! The First Division was Hu Zongnan's old mainstay, fully equipped with American weaponry. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, it had always been stationed in the Northwest and he was reluctant to use it. Now, in the blink of an eye, it has vanished like smoke, which must be extremely painful for Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan! What was particularly unexpected for Chiang and Hu was that such a trusted and direct lineage unit actually had two companies stage an anti-civil war uprising on the front line, which shows that the general trend of popular alienation from the reactionaries is irreversible. If the civil war continues, there will certainly be more incidents of uprisings and anti-war actions within Chiang's army, including Chiang's direct lineage units.

The repeated victories of the Taiyue Column are by no means accidental. First, the department has an inseparable, flesh-and-blood relationship with the local people. Whether in peacetime or wartime, it cares for the people everywhere and strictly follows the glorious traditions of the Eighth Route Army—the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention—thereby further arousing the people's enthusiasm for participating in the war and supporting the army. As soon as Hu's army entered the southern Shanxi area, it encountered not only the powerful resistance of the main force of the Eighth Route Army but also the encirclement of the entire people's guerrilla sea. Its telephone lines were often unable to be cleared, and it was completely under the strict blockade of the army and people in the liberated areas. When the main force of Hu's army advanced, the local armed forces immediately restored the Maojin Ferry and other Yellow River crossings in its rear. Second, the Taiyue Column is calm, firm, brave, and good at fighting. Once they engage Chiang's army, they will not stop until they defeat the opponent. The Battle of Taal Mountain, in which two squads defeated a regiment of Hu's army and the position stood firm, is the best example. This is in stark contrast to the lack of fighting spirit of Chiang's army. Third, Generals Chen Geng and Wang Xinting are skilled in command, conducting mobile warfare, not caring about the gains and losses of a city or town, but focusing on eliminating the enemy's active forces, and are good at striking the enemy unexpectedly and unprepared.

From this southern Shanxi campaign, we can see more clearly the contradiction between Chiang Kai-shek's strategic intentions for an unjust war and his limited military strength. Chiang and Hu were very cautious in their second advance into southern Shanxi, but has this contradiction been overcome? The answer is that it is still impossible to overcome. Chiang's side, with limited military strength, enters the vast liberated areas to fight, attempting to achieve the goal of occupying distant points and lines. Its rear is empty and its forces are dispersed, giving the army and people in the liberated areas the opportunity to carry out annihilation strikes. This is the inevitable result of the development of the war. The people's war of self-defense in the liberated areas is patriotic and just. Our main force has the cooperation and assistance of a large number of local regiments and militias, and can be expanded day by day in the war. Chiang Kai-shek relies on the new weapons given to him by American imperialism and has temporarily occupied some cities, but these new weapons have become an important source of supplementary weapons for the people's army. When the invading forces are eliminated to a certain extent, the towns and cities that we have withdrawn from for mobile warfare will eventually return to our hands. Even if Chiang Kai-shek knows this law, he cannot avoid it. When Chiang's army first entered Shanxi and Hu's army occupied Wenxi and other places, they boasted about their victory, but in a short time, they lost many men and horses and gave away many weapons! This is like the active withdrawal of our army from Rugao, Hai'an, Huangqiao, Dongming, Kaocheng, and Dingtao on the Su-Wan and Longhai fronts, which is the prelude to nine victories in nine battles. Therefore, whenever Chiang's side boasts about occupying cities and is elated, it is the day when Chiang's army begins to suffer large-scale losses. As Mr. Chen Jinkun said, if the civil war continues, Chiang's side "will suffer even greater losses; there is only a small possibility of suffering only small losses." Mr. Chen's estimate is very correct. As long as we mobilize all the people more widely and deeply, are good at learning from the experience on the battlefield, remember the insurmountable weaknesses of Chiang's side mentioned above, adhere to the policy of mobile warfare and eliminating the enemy's active forces, carefully deploy each battle, and annihilate the enemy with superior forces, we will be confident of achieving continuous victories. We call on the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Democratic Allied Army, and the people's army on other self-defense fronts to learn from the Taiyue Column, to learn from the heroes of Suzhong, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, etc. After being wounded, Chiang's army will still launch a frantic attack, and arduous battles are still ahead of us. Therefore, we must not be proud of victory, but continue to work hard, annihilate more invaders, and create more victories, until we completely crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!

### 向太岳纵队致敬！

　　向太岳纵队致敬！
    捷报传来，八路军太岳纵队二十四日在晋南浮山外围地区，歼灭胡宗南军精锐第一师全师，这是晋南八路军继七月间歼灭胡军两师、八月间解放同蒲中段二百七十里、歼灭阎锡山军万余后的第三次大捷，这与中原部队的胜利突围，苏中南线的七战七捷，陇海路与晋冀鲁豫的歼灭蒋军六师，同为光辉胜利，对于粉碎蒋介石进攻，争取国内和平民主，有其不可磨灭的功绩！我们于欢欣庆祝之余，特向太岳纵队全体指战员敬致崇高的敬礼！
    胡宗南的进军晋南，是一桩投机买卖，他企图代阎锡山而为山西土皇帝。胡军七月初出师，原定计划是三个星期打通同蒲南段，驻节太原，会攻上党。胡宗南过高地估计自己的力量，而过低地估计经过八年抗战、空前醒觉的山西军民的力量。闻喜附近一战，胡军损失达两师之众，始尝到八路军与山西人民的厉害，他就一面被迫修改预定计划，将打通同蒲路推迟至十月十日为期；同时调兵遣将，七拚八凑增援至十师兵力，甚至不惜将其最精锐的第一军第一师投入晋南前线。因有闻喜之战的惨痛教训，胡军来势虽猛，行动却十分谨慎小心，稳扎稳打，步步为营。这时，我们便再次警告胡宗南，不要偷鸡不着蚀把米；言犹在耳，胡军精锐第一师竟以全军覆没闻！第一师是胡宗南发家的老本，全付美械装备，抗战八年，向来留置西北，舍不得动用，现在一霎眼便烟消云散，这对于蒋介石与胡宗南，岂非万分痛心之事！特别出乎蒋胡意料之外的，就是这样一个亲信的嫡系部队，在火线上竟有两个连举行反内战起义，这说明反动派众叛亲离的总趋势是无法挽救的。内战继续下去，蒋军内部包括蒋军嫡系部队在内，一定还有更多起义反战的事件发生。
    太岳纵队的一再获胜，决非偶然。第一是该部与当地人民有血肉不可分的亲密关系，无论在平时或在战时，都处处爱护人民，严格在遵行八路军的光荣传统——三大纪律八项注意，因而更加激起人民参战拥军的热忱。胡军一进入晋南地区，它所遭到的不只是八路军主力兵团的有力阻击，而且是全体民众游击大海的包围，它的电话线经常不能畅通，它完全处于解放区军民的严密封锁中。而当胡军主力前进时，其后方的茅津渡等黄河渡口，立即被当地地方武装恢复。第二是太岳纵队的沉着坚定，英勇善战，他们一与蒋军接战，非把对方打垮不可，塔儿山之战，以两班击溃胡军一团，阵地屹立不动，就是一个最好的例证。这与蒋军之士无斗志，恰成一个明显的对照。第三是陈赓和王新亭将军之指挥有方，机动作战，不斤斤于一城一市的得失，而专心致志于消灭对方的有生力量，善于出敌不意，击敌无备。
    从这次晋南战役中，更可以看清楚蒋介石非正义战争的战略意图与其兵力有限的矛盾。蒋胡在晋南第二次进军是十分小心翼翼的，但是这个矛盾克服了没有？答案是仍然无法克服，蒋方以有限之兵力，进入广大解放区作战，企图达成占领距离辽远的点线的目的，其后方空虚，兵力分散，给解放区军民以进行歼灭打击之机会，这是战争开展的必然结果。解放区人民的自卫战争，则是爱国的和正义的，我们的主力军有广大地方兵团和民兵的配合和援助，能够在战争中日益扩大起来。蒋介石依靠美帝国主义所给他的新式武器，暂时占领了若干城市，但是这些新式武器却成为人民军队补充武器之一个重要来源。而在进犯者有生力量消灭到一定程度之时，我们为了机动作战而退出之若干城镇，终必重归我手。这一规律，蒋介石即使知道，也是无法避免的。蒋方初入晋、胡军占领闻喜等地时，曾大吹胜利，然而曾几何时，损失许多人马，送掉许多武器！此在苏皖和陇海前线我军之主动撤离如皋、海安、黄桥、东明、考城、定陶等地，正是九战九捷的前奏。因此，凡是蒋方大吹占领城市兴高采烈之时，正是蒋军大规模损兵折将开始之日。陈瑾昆先生所说，内战打下去，蒋方“更吃大亏，此实有大大可能；只吃小亏，此仅有小小可能”。陈先生这种估计，是很对的。只要我们把全体人民更广泛和深入地动员起来，善于吸取战场上的经验，记住上面所说蒋方不可克服的弱点，坚持掌握机动作战和及消灭进犯者有生力量的方针，细心布署每个战役，以优势兵力消灭敌人，我们就有把握取得不断胜利。我们号召八路军、新四军、民主联军及其他自卫战线上的人民军队，向太岳纵队学习，向苏中、晋冀鲁豫等地健儿学习，蒋军在受创之后，还将疯狂再犯，艰巨的战斗还在我们前面。因此，我们切须闻胜勿骄，再接再厉，歼灭更多的进犯者，创造更多的胜利，一直到完全粉碎蒋介石的进攻为止！
