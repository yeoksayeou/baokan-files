　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in Handan on the 19th] The people's patriotic self-defense guerrilla warfare in the border areas of northern Henan has exhausted the invading Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops. The 41st Brigade of the 32nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, stationed in Wuzhi County south of the Daoqing Railway, has been repeatedly harassed by our guerrillas. At the end of last month, when they fiercely attacked Xia Ma and Zhong Ma villages north of the Qin River, they were again defeated by our guerrillas, with about 30 of the invading troops killed and one Czech-style machine gun and one and a half boxes of American-made bullets seized. The Chiang Kai-shek army is now rushing to build fortifications to prevent attacks by our guerrillas. The 164th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek army and the Zhang Bohua puppet troops stationed in Meng County, under the continuous counterattacks of our guerrillas, although the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops launched a total of four piecemeal encroachments of more than 100 people each in the ten days from August 28th to September 9th, they were all defeated by our local armed forces and militia rotation teams, killing or wounding a total of 11 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet invading troops, recovering 800 jin of grain snatched by the invading troops and returning it to the masses, and recovering Xiyang, Xiaochuan and other villages that the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops attempted to occupy as bases for piecemeal encroachment.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 20th] The Eighth Route Army in Northwestern Shanxi has repelled the attack of Fu Zuoyi's troops on Pianguan and Hequ, and the two cities are still under the control of the Eighth Route Army. More than 1,000 Fu Zuoyi troops stationed in the Qingshuihe area, the southeastern tip of Suiyuan, once invaded the two cities of Pianguan and Hequ on the 12th in several routes, carrying out rampant burning, killing, and looting. The local armed forces, in conjunction with the militia, rose up in self-defense and quickly drove the Fu Zuoyi troops who had invaded the above-mentioned two cities out, and severely damaged them in the suburbs.
