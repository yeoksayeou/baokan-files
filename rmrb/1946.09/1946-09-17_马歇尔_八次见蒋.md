　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 14th: U.S. Special Envoy Marshall flew back to Nanjing from Guling on the 10th and flew to Guling again on the 13th, marking his eighth visit to Guling to see Chiang Kai-shek. After the five-person committee initiated by Marshall and U.S. Ambassador Stuart stalled, Chiang Kai-shek, with continued U.S. assistance, continued to expand the civil war. This situation has aroused reactions from all aspects of the United States. Wallace's speech on the 12th is one example. On the China issue, Wallace advocated a "foreign non-interference policy," and "cooperation among all parties" and "unity and peace" in China. Although this aide of Roosevelt, the only one remaining in Truman's cabinet, did not openly criticize the U.S. government's policy towards China, his speech reflected the American people's opposition to the U.S. government's "interference policy" towards China and encouraged them. President Truman, who is implementing the "interference policy," stated that he "agreed" with Wallace's speech and said that there was no difference between Wallace's and Secretary of State Byrnes' policies, attempting to deceive the American people.

　　马歇尔  八次见蒋
    【新华社延安十四日电】美国特使马歇尔十日自牯岭飞回南京，十三日又飞往牯岭，这是马氏赴牯岭见蒋介石的第八次。马氏与美大使司徒雷登所发起的五人委员会陷于僵局后，蒋介石在美方继续援助下继续扩大内战，这一情势已引起美国各方面的反应。华莱士十二日演说即是一个例证。华莱士在对中国问题上主张“外国不干涉政策”、中国“各党派合作”、“团结与和平”。这位唯一的留在杜鲁门内阁里的罗斯福的助手虽然没有露骨批评美国政府的对华政策，但是他的演说却反映美国人民反对美政府对华“干涉政策”的情绪，并对他们起了鼓励的作用。执行“干涉政策”的杜鲁门总统，则声明“同意”华莱士的演说，并说华莱士与国务卿贝纳斯的政策并无区别，企图这样蒙混美国人民的耳目。
