Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 15th: Shanghai sources report that while Marshall attempts to conceal Washington's crimes of expanding the Chinese civil war, most believe he has little hope of success. Chinese centrists and neutral American observers in China are increasingly critical of Washington, noting that Marshall's attitude is weaker than before. His initial formula, "China must cease fire," has been replaced by the new formula, "Chiang Kai-shek demands such and such." Marshall once said he held two trump cards to stop the civil war, but after Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war, the trump cards he revealed were "continued aid to Chiang" and "the United States is unable to stop the war in China." Keen observers believe that Marshall's attitude changed because Chiang had used the so-called "mediation" period to complete preparations for a major war, and Chiang had fully armed and deployed his troops with American assistance. Ma Xulun, former Vice Minister of Education, a leader of the centrists who petitioned Marshall, Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhou Enlai for peace in June, wrote in the Democratic Weekly published on the 8th: "Since Marshall took office, the situation in China has deteriorated rapidly. Can't the United States stop it? No one can believe it." The article revealed that representatives of the Shanghai peace movement had told Marshall, "The United States should not sacrifice China in order to deal with the Soviet Union," to which Marshall remained silent. Other centrist leaders, including Shanghai industrialist Zhang Zongbo and Democratic League spokesman, the famous liberal Dr. Luo Longji, accused the U.S.-supplied materials sponsored by Marshall of fueling the Chinese civil war. Dr. Luo also condemned Marshall for helping Chiang to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, citing his initiation of the Five-Man Committee as an example. An editorial in the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury on September 5th demanded that Washington respect civil rights, immediately send American soldiers home, and revealed that U.S. aid to Chiang was "more easily used for war than for peace," but "the American authorities have clearly not required the National Government not to use these materials for combat." The China Weekly Review continued to criticize Washington's mistakes, raising the question in June: "Is General Marshall here as a mediator? Or as the commander-in-chief of the American and Kuomintang allied forces attacking Yan'an?"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 15th: Shanghai sources report that the independent Shanghai United Evening News described Marshall's seventh trip to Lushan on September 8th, saying: "After Special Envoy Marshall's seventh trip to Lushan, he no longer seemed as tense and busy as in the past. Every day, he either strolled with his wife on the slopes, contemplated the moon, or admired ancient Chinese paintings." The newspaper did not explain why this failed mediator looked like a triumphant victor after the full-scale outbreak of the Chinese civil war, but stated: "This picture of an allied friend's leisure and enjoyment, juxtaposed with the picture of China's war and famine, cannot alleviate the heavy pressure on the people's hearts." Note that Marshall returned to Nanjing on the 10th and went to Lushan on the 13th.

　　上海中间人士评论
    美助蒋内战罪恶
    马歇尔难以掩饰
    【新华社延安十五日电】上海讯：马歇尔虽企图掩饰华盛顿扩大中国内战的罪恶，但众信他已绝少成功的希望。中国中间派和美国在华中立观察家，正纷纷批评华盛顿，并发现马歇尔的态度较前弱，马氏初来时的公式“中国必须停战”，已被新的公式“蒋介石要求如此如此”所代替。马氏曾说他手中有两张王牌足以停止内战，但当蒋介石已发动全面内战后，他摊开的王牌却是“继续援蒋”及“美国无力制止中国的战争”。敏锐的观察家相信，马氏态度改变是因为蒋已利用所谓“调处”期间完成大战的准备，蒋已因美国援助而充分武装了和展开了他的军队。六月间乃向马歇尔，蒋介石、周恩来请愿和平的中间派领袖前教育部次长马叙伦，在八日间出版的民主周刊撰文称：“马歇尔上任以来中国的局面有如江河日下，难道美国竟没有力量制止？谁都不能相信。”该文透露上海和平运动代表曾告马歇尔“美国不要因为对付苏联拿中国来做牺牲品”，马氏默然不答。其他中间派领袖包括上海工业家张总伯与民主同盟发言人著名自由主义者罗隆基博士指斥马氏所赞助的美援蒋物资为助长中国内战。罗博士并谴责马氏助蒋破坏政协决议，其发起五人会议即一实例。上海大美晚报九月五日社论要求华盛顿尊重民权，立即让美兵回国，并揭露美援蒋物资用于战争比用于和平更易见效”，但“美国当局显然并没有要求国民政府勿用此项物资作战”。密勒氏评论报继续批评华盛顿的错误，该报在六月间即已这样提出问题：“究竟马歇尔将军到这里来是做调停人呢？还是做美国与国民党联军进攻延安的总司令？”
    【新华社延安十五日电】上海讯：独立的上海联合晚报在九月八日描写马歇尔七上卢山时的情况说：“马歇尔特使七上庐山后，似不复如过去之紧张忙碌，每日但与夫人徘徊坡道或对月默思或欣赏中国古画而已。该报未解释中国内战全面爆发后这个调处的失败者何以反像一个得意的胜利者，但称：“此盟国友人之闲情逸趣图与中国战祸灾荒图相对照，绝不能减轻人民心头的重压。”按马歇尔氏在十日回南京后，已于十三日上庐山。
