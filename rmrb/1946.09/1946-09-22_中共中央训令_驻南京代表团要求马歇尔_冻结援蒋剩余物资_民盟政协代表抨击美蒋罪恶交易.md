Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: A spokesman for the CCP Central Committee told our reporter today: The CCP Central Committee has instructed the delegation stationed in Nanjing to request General Marshall, the U.S. Special Envoy, to freeze the so-called "remaining supplies" recently transacted between the U.S. and Chiang. The spokesman pointed out that these supplies include a large number of aircraft and automobiles. Chiang Kai-shek has planned to use the latter to organize a rapid force of 10,000 automobiles for the civil war. The materials and money supplied by the United States to Chiang Kai-shek, excluding this time, have reached more than 150,000 million yuan in so-called "Lend-Lease materials" alone, of which three-fifths were supplied before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Loans to China totaled fourteen times, amounting to 1,314,590,000 U.S. dollars, bringing the total of the two items to more than 2,800 million U.S. dollars. Apart from being used for civil war and corruption by Kuomintang officials, this huge amount of money and materials has not been used for any construction. McCabe of the U.S. International Liquidation Committee claims that this "sale of remaining supplies" is to help China achieve "peace and unity" and "restore" China's economy. Besides being a lie, it is nothing but insidious. American imperialists used to provide Japanese fascists with "scrap iron" and gasoline to invade China and slaughter the Chinese people. Now they provide Chinese fascist Chiang Kai-shek with so-called "remaining supplies" and "Lend-Lease materials" to fight a civil war and slaughter the Chinese people, in order to turn China into a colony of the United States. The spokesman concluded: This request to Marshall will once again test whether Marshall, as the Miller’s Review commented, "is in China as an American mediator or as the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang and U.S. allied forces attacking Yan'an." There have been many such tests, including three protests between April and June against the United States transporting troops to the Northeast on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek. Marshall did not reply to any of them. The most recent one was before the so-called "sale of remaining supplies" was concluded. The CCP made a serious protest to Marshall, but Marshall ignored it.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th: Shanghai News: Representatives of the Democratic League in Shanghai at the Political Consultative Conference unanimously criticized the sinful transaction of the U.S. selling remaining supplies. Mr. Shen Junru said: "If the United States is sincere in helping China achieve peace, it should not take actions that promote China's civil war." Mr. Zhang Dongsun said: "Looking at the U.S.'s intentions towards China today, it wants to turn China into a militarily advantageous zone for the U.S. to deal with the Soviet Union, which is completely different from what the Chinese people want." Mr. Zhang Bojun hoped that the United States would study Chinese history, especially the history of Japan's assistance to the Northern Warlords. At that time, it created political darkness in China. But the results Japan has achieved today can serve as a reference for the United States. Mr. Zhang Junmai said: "At a time when the flames of civil war are raging, the United States selling supplies to the civil war faction is harmful and not beneficial to solving the civil war problem."

　　中共中央训令
    驻南京代表团要求马歇尔
    冻结援蒋剩余物资   
    民盟政协代表抨击美蒋罪恶交易
    【新华社延安十九日电】中共中央发言人今日对本社记者谈称：中共中央已训令驻南京代表团，要求美国全权特使马歇尔将军冻结最近美蒋间成交的所谓“剩余物资”。发言人指出：此项物资中，有大量飞机与汽车，后者蒋介石已预定用以组织一万辆汽车之快速部队进行内战。美国供给蒋介石之物资与金钱，除此次不算，仅所谓“租借物资”已达十五万万元以上，其中五分之三为抗战胜利前所供应的。对华贷款共十四次共十三万万一千四百五十九万美金，两项共计廿八万万美金以上。此项巨大物资金钱，除用于内战及供国民党官吏贪污以外，未闻作任何建设之用。美国国际清算委员会麦凯布所谓此项“剩余物资之买卖”，为协助中国获得“和平与团结”及“恢复”中国之经济，除谎言而外，惟有阴险而已。美国帝国主义者从前以“废铁”与汽油给日本法西斯侵略中国屠杀中国人民，现在则以所谓“剩余物资”“租借物资”供给中国法西斯蒋介石打内战屠杀中国人民，以便把中国变为美国的殖民地。发言人结语说：此次向马歇尔提出之要求，将再一次试验马歇尔如密勒氏评论报所说“究竟是到中国来做美国的调停人还是做国民党与美国联军进攻延安的总司令。”这种试验已有多次，包括四月至六月间三次抗议美国代蒋介石运兵赴东北在内，马歇尔均未答复。最近的一次即在所谓“剩余物资”之买卖尚未成交前，中共方面曾向马歇尔提出严重抗议，然而马歇尔竟仍置之不理。
    【新华社延安十八日电】沪讯：民盟在沪政协代表一致抨击美国让售剩余物资的罪恶交易。沈钧儒氏称：“美国如有诚意协助中国实现和平，首先就不应该有这种助长中国内战的行动。”张东荪氏说：“看美国今天对中国的用心，是想把中国变成对美军事上有利的地带，以便对付苏联，这和中国人民的想法完全不同。”章伯钧氏希望美国研究中国历史，尤其是日本援助北洋军阀的历史，那时候曾造成中国的政治黑暗。但日本今天所得结果足供美国参考。张君劢氏谓：“正在内战燎原之时，美国将物资卖给内战家，这对解决内战问题是有害而无利的。”
