Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 22nd. A certain division of the Eighth Route Army in the Central Shandong Military Region, following the victory of the self-defense counterattack in Nanbu Village, Zhangqiu, recently held a grand gathering at its station to reward combat heroes and models of shooting, reconnaissance, discipline, and love for the masses. More than 500 people were awarded. When the heroes successively took the stage to report their model deeds, the entire venue was filled with a revolutionary heroic spirit of competition. Combat hero Zheng Yuanyou reported that he had been wounded three times but did not leave the front line, and also seized a mountain gun from the Chiang army. He said: "At that time, I had already been wounded three times, but thinking that the whole platoon had not yet seized the American weapons of the Chiang army to arm ourselves, I forgot the pain of the wound, and slung the gun from my injured right arm to my left arm, and pounced on the Chiang army's mountain gun position. A grenade blew up the Chiang army artillerymen, and I greeted the comrades in the same squad to drag back a mountain gun." Combat model Su Ruicai recounted the scene of capturing prisoners alive, saying: "My three comrades and I were surrounded by more than a dozen Chiang soldiers. The Chiang soldiers threatened and shouted to surrender our guns. We replied: Only you surrender your guns, it will never be our turn to surrender. Saying that, we threw a burst of grenades, suddenly overturning the Chiang soldiers, and captured five prisoners alive." The model company that fought the Chiang army's reinforcements, instructor Zhang Ming reported: "The Chiang army came to reinforce from the north. We waited for them to enter the ambush circle, and then leaped out to launch a self-defense war. The American-equipped Chiang army could only spin around in the air, with no way to deal with us. The Chiang army is most afraid of bayonet fighting. As soon as they see bayonets, they run. We chased all the way to the railway, so that the assault troops successfully completed their mission. The whole company captured two cannons, three machine guns, and eighty rifles in the pursuit." Finally, guest Li Nianlin, the Shandong militia's blasting king, took the stage to give a speech, saying: "Tell the main force comrades that the militiamen have prepared the landmines and want to compete with you to win battles."

　　鲁中某部集会嘉奖英雄模范
    群英登台详话战绩
    【新华社临沂二十二日电】鲁中军区八路军某师于章邱南埠村自卫反击胜利后，日前在驻地举行盛大集会，奖励战斗英雄及射击、侦察、遵守纪律、爱护群众等模范。受奖者五百余人，当英雄们相继登台报告模范事迹时，全场充满革命英雄主义竞赛的情绪。战斗英雄郑元友报告他三次负伤不下火线，并夺获蒋军山炮的经过他说：“当时我已负伤三次，但想到全排尚未缴到蒋军美式武器来武装自己，就忘了伤口的痛楚，把枪从受伤的右膀挎到左膀，猛扑蒋军山炮阵地，一颗手榴弹把蒋军炮兵炸毁，便招呼同班的同志把一门山炮拖了回来。”战斗模范苏瑞才，叙述捉活俘虏的情景说：“我和同班三个同志，被十多个蒋军围住了，蒋军威胁着喊叫缴枪，我们回答说：只有你们缴枪，从来轮不到我们缴枪，说着打了一阵手榴弹，突翻蒋军，活捉了五名俘虏。”打蒋军增援部队的模范连，指导员张明报告说：“蒋军由北面来援，我们等他进入伏击圈内，便一跃突出展开自卫战，美械蒋军，只好在空中打转转，一点没办法，蒋军最怕肉搏，一见刺刀就跑，我们一直追击到铁路边，使攻坚部队胜利完成任务，全连在追击中共缴获炮二门，机枪三挺，步枪八十支。”最后来宾中山东民兵爆炸大王李念林上台致词道：“告诉主力老大哥们，民兵们已把地雷准备妥当，要和你们比赛打胜仗。”
