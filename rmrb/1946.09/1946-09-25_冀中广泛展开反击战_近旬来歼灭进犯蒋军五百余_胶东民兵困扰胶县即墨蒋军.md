Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 20th: The prelude to a widespread self-defense counter-offensive by the military and civilians in the border areas of the Central Hebei Liberated Area has already begun. In recent weeks, over 500 invading Chiang troops have been killed, wounded, or captured, and over ten machine guns, one mortar, and over 300 rifles, as well as some ammunition, have been seized. On the western front, after the Liu Hua-nan unit of the 2nd Division of Chiang's puppet troops in Baoding invaded Rongcheng in the Liberated Area on the evening of the 6th, local troops and militias actively harassed them. On the 10th, over 700 Chiang troops from Rongcheng went to Gucheng Railway Station (north of Xushui) and were ambushed by local guerrillas near Zhuang village, northwest of the city, suffering over 50 casualties and leaving behind 14 large carts of ammunition and wheat. The Chiang troops were blocked and fled back into the city. Militias also wiped out a small team of Chiang troops (ten men) near Ninggezhuang village, east of the city. In addition, some troops were detached to penetrate the flanks and rear of the Chiang troops, and on the evenings of the 10th and 11th, they successively removed Chiang troop strongholds in Dabaituan and Weizhuang, 20 li southwest of Baoding, routing nine companies of Liu Hua's unit of the 2nd Division of Chiang's puppet troops. Liu, in his old age, flew into a rage and personally led the main force of three battalions (one battalion of the 1st Regiment and two battalions of the 2nd Regiment) and the directly subordinate teams of the division, totaling over 1,500 men, across the Jinqian River to invade the Eighth Route Army positions in Yougezhuang, Xuguzhuang (south of Baoding), and other places. Finding nothing, on the 14th, they advanced under the cover of artillery to Dabai City and Manying area. At this point, the Eighth Route Army launched a counter-attack, routing them. In this battle, the bodies of 48 Chiang's puppet soldiers were left behind, and 180 officers and soldiers below the battalion commander level were captured, along with four light machine guns, one mortar, and over 100 rifles. Near Shijiazhuang on the southern front, the Eighth Route Army also successively liberated Niucun, on the highway more than ten li south of Luancheng, on the evening of the 8th, and Dalang Town, northeast of Luancheng, and other important Chiang troop strongholds on the 10th. In these two battles, a total of 20 Chiang troops were killed or wounded, 82 were captured alive, and one light machine gun, two grenade launchers, 85 long and short guns, and some ammunition were seized. The electric wires erected by the Chiang troops between Shijiazhuang, Luancheng, and Zhengding have been almost completely destroyed by the militia. The Chiang troops who have invaded Zhao County in the Liberated Area are now under attack from all sides and are extremely panicked and shaken. On the northern front, the local armed militias on both sides of the Yongding River are also very active. On the 8th, our guerrillas repeatedly repelled two invasions by Chiang troops in the Daxiaobaicaowa area, north of Geyucheng. That evening, they took the opportunity to attack the Chiang troop strongholds in Chenjiazui, Pangzhuangzi, and Aipu, east of the city, killing or wounding more than ten Chiang troops, capturing 20, and seizing three light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and more than 40 rifles. When more than 200 puppet troops from Luofa invaded the south on the 15th, they were also routed by local guerrillas, who killed or wounded 53 of them, seized two light machine guns, and 60 long and short guns. A group of Chiang's political bandits who had infiltrated Xin'an Town, east of Yongqing, south of the Yongding River, were also completely wiped out by local armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 22nd: Local armed forces and militias in Jiaodong have launched a struggle against "nibbling." The troops of the 54th Army of Chiang's army, entrenched in Jiaoxian and Jimo cities, fearing the unpredictable harassment and attacks of the surrounding militias, are attempting to implement a "nibbling" policy, building strongholds outside the city and using bunkers to defend the county seat. The local armed forces and militias of Jiaoxian, using the anti-"nibbling" experience of the eight-year War of Resistance, used self-made landmines and explosives to level the strongholds of Guanzhuang in the north of the city, Hejiatun in the west of the city, and Dazhuang in the east of the city three times. The Jimo militia also blew up large and small bunkers in Lianhua Mountain and Chenshudun, east of the city, forcing the Chiang troops to shrink back into the city. In the above explosions and attacks, a total of one battalion and two companies of Chiang troops were wiped out, over 40 were captured alive, and one cannon, over 30 light and heavy machine guns (including six American-made carbines), and over 70 rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Tengxian, 22nd: On the 16th, Wu Huawen's puppet troops invaded Jining City in southwestern Shandong and were met with fierce street-by-street and house-by-house fighting by the Eighth Route Army and residents. After inflicting heavy casualties on the invading army, the Eighth Route Army took the initiative to retreat to the outskirts of the city to resist the attack at dusk.
