　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th. Guerrilla warfare has universally unfolded in the liberated areas. Soldiers and civilians in the Jidong liberated area have repelled the Chiang army's attack on Malanyu, between Zunhua, Pinggu, and Jixian, and guerrilla warfare has universally unfolded in various places. All invading Chiang troops south of the Beining Railway have been defeated. Except for a few strongholds such as Leting, there are no traces of Chiang's troops. The militia and guerrilla forces in central Jiangsu are active, capturing more than 200 Chiang soldiers. Because they feared the prestige of the militia, they were escorted only by three small-footed women without weapons, and not one dared to run away. The militia's weapons include rifles, light and heavy machine guns, as well as carbine-Tommy style American weapons. Within two months, the militia in Lincheng, southern Shandong, killed, wounded, and captured more than 100 Chiang soldiers, including company commanders and below. More than 20 militiamen in Yixian captured more than a dozen Chiang soldiers in the dark of night on one occasion.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jidong Front, 20th. The 56th Division of the Chiang army, which advanced on Malanyu, our core area between Zunhua, Xinglong, and Jixian counties on the 13th, has been repelled by the local Eighth Route Army. Currently, the soldiers and civilians in the Jidong liberated area are universally launching guerrilla warfare to harass, attack, and eliminate the invading Chiang army, making them enemies on all sides, in order to accumulate small victories into great victories. At the beginning of the month, the Chiang army, which advanced from Changli to the liberated area north of the Beining Railway, was ambushed at Honghuayu and retreated to Liutian Gezhuang. A part of them scurried towards Lulong on the 7th. In this battle, the Eighth Route Army killed more than 140 Chiang soldiers, including battalion commanders and below, and captured two light machine guns, more than 5,000 rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies. In addition, the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the puppet Hebei Security Corps, which was transferred north from Leting, was ambushed by the 13th Sub-district Garrison Regiment at Hefengzhuang on the Tingliu River on the 12th, killing and wounding more than a dozen puppet soldiers and capturing a machine gun and ammunition. At present, all the invading Chiang troops south of the Beining Railway have been defeated by the Eighth Route Army and local armed forces. Except for strongholds such as Leting and Macheng, which are still defended by a small number of Chiang soldiers, there are no traces of Chiang's troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sheng County, 20th. The militia in the areas of southern Shandong occupied by Chiang's troops are widely launching guerrilla warfare such as explosions, night attacks, ambushes, and harassment, making it impossible for Chiang's troops to defend against them. The Lincheng militia fought more than 50 battles in July and August, killing, wounding, and capturing 126 Chiang soldiers, including company commanders and below. The militia in Yunhe County (Xin County, the triangular area between the Jinpu and Longhai railways and south of the Grand Canal) killed and wounded 67 Chiang soldiers, including company commanders and below, with landmines and ambushes in nearly a month, and captured more than a dozen American-style rifles and machine guns. Sun Zu, from the ninth district of Yixian, led more than 20 militiamen and took advantage of the dark of a moonless night to ambush the area around Juliang Bridge (32 li east of Hanzhuang) along the Grand Canal, killing more than a dozen Chiang soldiers. The militia in the fifth district of Pixian, led by Liu Qian San, conducted guerrilla warfare among the Chiang army strongholds and bunkers along the Bulao River, making the Chiang army's lackeys, the "Homecoming Corps," afraid to show their faces.
    Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 18th. The militia in various parts of Binhai launched a heated explosion movement to defend their homes and wage guerrilla warfare. Militia hero Gao Guangzhen invented new-style aerial mines, step-on mines, steel pipe mines, and water mines that remain effective in water for a month. He personally led his explosives team, carrying the four newly created self-defense weapons, to Ganyu and other places to teach manufacturing and usage methods. The Donghai County Militia Explosives Training Class learned the blasting techniques of bamboo sheath mines, nail mines, and new-style water mines within a week. In places like Tancheng, the militia established a training team of more than 500 people to learn the blasting techniques of burying landmines.
