Xinhua News Agency, Central Jiangsu Front, 28th: Eight thousand invading troops of Chiang Kai-shek, besieged by the New Fourth Army in Jialishi, southwest of Rugao, were completely annihilated at dusk on the 27th. These included the 187th Brigade (originally renamed from a division) and one regiment of the 79th Brigade (originally renamed from a division), and one battalion of the 99th Brigade (renamed from a division) of the Chiang army. In addition, one battalion of Chiang's troops was annihilated in the Baimizhen area on the Hai'an-Taizhou line. The total loss of Chiang's troops in the two locations was 9,000 men. This is another great victory for the New Fourth Army after annihilating 6,000 Chiang troops in Fenjiezhen, northeast of Huangqiao. The aforementioned Chiang troops simultaneously launched offensives eastward and westward along the Rugao-Huangqiao Highway from Huangqiao and Rugao on the 24th, and were immediately intercepted and surrounded by the New Fourth Army at Fenjiezhen, 20 miles northeast of Huangqiao, and Jialishi, 25 miles southwest of Rugao. The Chiang troops on the Fenjiezhen route were completely annihilated by the New Fourth Army on the 26th (as reported in yesterday's newspaper), and the town was recovered. The New Fourth Army also launched a determined annihilation battle against the Chiang troops besieged in Jialishi, and after three days and nights of fierce fighting from the 25th, more than 8,000 Chiang troops in the area were finally completely destroyed on the evening of the 27th. In this battle, the New Fourth Army also shot down a fighter plane attempting to cover the breakout of Chiang's troops near Mojiatou, 25 miles south of Rugao (containing three heavy machine guns, and one pilot has been captured). In addition to the wounded and killed, more than 10,000 Chiang soldiers, including the deputy brigade commander of the 187th Brigade and below, laid down their weapons. The results of the battle are still being tallied. Another unit of the New Fourth Army, in order to counterattack the Chiang troops who had launched an offensive on the Hai'an-Taizhou line,突入 Baimizhen (20 miles east of Jiangyan) on the 26th, and then expanded its victory on the 27th, recovering the three strongholds of Da Baimizhen, Xiao Baimizhen, and Qutang on the line. One battalion of Chiang's troops stationed in the area was mostly annihilated. By this point, the Hai'an-Taizhou, Rugao-Huangqiao, and Nantong-Rugao highways have all been cut off by the New Fourth Army, and the Chiang troops occupying Rugao and Hai'an have fallen into a state of encirclement on all sides. The loss of officers and soldiers of Chiang's troops invading the southern Jiangsu central front has reached more than 53,000 people, including previous battles; the achievements of the militia guerrillas are not included.
    [This Newspaper Tongpu Front Dispatch on the 29th] The Yan puppet army continued to increase its troops in the central section of the Tongpu Railway. On the 25th, the first and second regiments of the Yan army's 44th Division and a part of the 219th Regiment of the 73rd Division aided the Yan army in Lingshi from Pingyao South to Jiexiu, and began a "mopping up" operation against our mountainous area east of Lingshi since the beginning of August. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and first captured Suozhouzhen (15 miles north of Lingshi City) on the night of the 25th, and captured Tianjiazhuang, Lijiazhuang, and other outer strongholds on the afternoon of the 28th. The Yan puppet army's 16th Security Regiment in the city fled westward in fear of punishment at 11 o'clock that night, and Lingshi County was liberated. The Yan puppet army that fled from Lingshi City has been heavily surrounded by our blocking troops. Currently, the Yan puppet strongholds along the railway line from Lingshi to Nanguan, 30 miles south, have fallen into a state of isolation and helplessness. The people of the entire county have requested our army to continue to eliminate harm for the people. The liberation of Lingshi is the fourth county seat liberated by our Tongpu Front troops after Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and Huoxian.

    【新华社苏中前线二十八日电】被新四军包围于如皋西南加力市蒋介石的犯军八千人，已于二十七日黄昏全部就歼，其中包括蒋军六十五师一八七旅（原军师改称）及七十九旅（原师改称）一个团，与九十九旅（师改称）一个营。另海（安）泰（州）线上白米镇一带，蒋军亦被歼一个营。两地蒋军合计损失九千人，这是继黄桥东北分界镇歼灭蒋军六千人后，新四军的又一次大捷。上述蒋军系二十四日同时自黄桥如皋两地，沿如黄公路东西出犯，旋即为新四军分别堵击包围于黄桥东北二十里之分界镇，与如皋西南二十五里之加力市。分界镇一路蒋军，二十六日即为新四军全部歼灭（已见昨日本报），并收复该镇。对于被围于加力市之蒋军，新四军亦展开坚决之歼灭战，于二十五日起，激战三昼夜，至二十七日黄昏，该地蒋军八千余人，终于全部溃灭。是役，新四军并击落企图掩护蒋军突围之战斗机一架于如皋南二十五里之磨家头附近（内有重机枪三挺，已俘获机师一名）。两路蒋军除伤亡者外，有一八七旅副旅长以下万余人放下武器，战果正清查中。新四军另部为反击海（安）泰（州）线上出犯之蒋军，于二十六日突入大白米镇（姜堰东二十里）后，复于二十七日扩张战果，将该线大小白米镇及曲塘三据点收复，侵驻该地蒋军一个营，大部就歼。至此，海（安）泰（州）、如（皋）黄（桥）、南（通）如（皋）诸公路，均为新四军所切断，侵踞如皋、海安两地蒋军，已陷入四面包围状态。进犯苏中南线蒋军损失官兵，连前后计已达五万三千人以上，民兵游击队战绩在外。
    【本报同蒲前线二十九日急电】阎伪军继续增兵同蒲线中段，二十五日阎军四十四师一、二两团及七十三师二一九团一部，由平遥南开介休援助灵石阎军，自八月上旬开始对我灵石以东山地清剿。八路军被迫自卫，于二十五日夜先攻克索州镇（灵石城北十五里），二十八日下午攻克田家庄、李家庄等外围据点，城内阎伪军保安师十六团于当夜十一时畏罪弃城向西逃窜，灵石县城即告解放。自灵石城逃窜之阎伪军，已为我堵击部队重重包围。现灵石以南至南关三十里之铁路沿线，阎伪据点已陷入孤立无援状态，全县人民纷纷请求我军继续为民除害。灵石之解放，为我同蒲前线部队继洪洞、赵城、霍县解放后之第四座县城。
