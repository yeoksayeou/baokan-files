　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Civil War Situation
    Our Army's Large-Scale Elimination of Chiang's Troops is Chiang's Fatal Weakness
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on today's military news, saying: The current situation in the civil war is a contrast between the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army eliminating a large number of Chiang's troops' effective strength, and Chiang's troops occupying certain cities. The Chiang side is desperately touting the occupation of Chengde, and many foreign journalists are estimating Chiang's "victory" based on weapons. However, the Chiang side is keeping silent about its own continuous loss of effective strength, which proves that this is its fatal weakness. In today's vast civil war battlefield, there is a complex mix of mobile warfare and extensive people's guerrilla warfare. In addition to large-scale annihilation battles, such as the seven major victories in Central Jiangsu and the two major victories on the Longhai Front, the militia and local corps in the liberated areas have carried out countless small-scale annihilations against the enemy, which has caused Chiang Kai-shek and his senior generals extreme distress. According to incomplete military news received today, apart from the New Fourth Army's proactive withdrawal from Huaiyin, where they annihilated 5,000 Chiang troops in the vicinity of the city, local armed forces and militias in areas such as the vicinity of Lincheng in southern Shandong, Tangshan in eastern Hebei, Hecheng in northwestern Shanxi, the Northeast, northern Henan, and north of the Qin River, annihilated 1,500 Chiang troops. The war in eastern Henan and northern Jiangsu will unfold comprehensively and fiercely. A major battle is brewing near Heze in Jinji-Luyu.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-East Front, 21st] Military News: (1) The Chiang's army security 10th regiment of more than 400 people, which had attacked my Xin Juntun west of Tangshan in the early part of this month, was completely annihilated on the 16th under the counterattack of our 15th sub-district garrison regiment and sub-district guard company, and seized a heavy machine gun, eight light machine guns, more than 250 rifles, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. (2) On the 6th, the Eighth Route Army in eastern Hebei attacked Chiang's military transport vehicles passing through Xiezhuangzi, destroying eight vehicles, seizing rifles, bicycles, and other items, and capturing 12 people including a platoon leader, and killing or wounding 90 Chiang soldiers.

　　新华社记者评内战形势
    我军大量消灭蒋军乃是蒋方致命弱点
    【新华社延安十七日电】新华社记者就今日军事消息评称：今天内战形势，是八路军、新四军消灭大量蒋军有生力量，与蒋军侵占若干城市的对比。蒋方拚命鼓吹占领承德，许多外国记者则以武器来估计蒋军的“胜利”。但是，蒋方对于自己有生力量的不断丧失讳莫如深，正证明这是它的致命弱点。在今天广大的内战战场上，错综着运动战与广大的人民游击战。除了大规模的歼灭战，如苏中的七次大捷，与陇海前线的二次大捷以外，解放区民兵、地方兵团对敌人进行无数的小型歼灭，使蒋介石及其高级将领感到异常苦恼。综合今天所收到的不完全的军事消息，除了新四军主动撤出淮阴以前，在该城近郊一带歼灭蒋军五千以外，仅就鲁南临城近郊、冀东唐山、晋西北的河曲、东北、豫北、沁河以北等数地，地方武装及民兵即歼灭蒋军一千五百人。豫东、苏北战争将全面的剧烈展开。晋冀鲁豫荷泽附近，正酝酿大战。
    【新华社冀东前线二十一日电】军息：（一）本月上旬由唐山向西陷我新军屯之蒋军保安第十团四百余人，十六日在我十五分区警备团与分区警卫连反击下，已全部就歼，并缴获重机枪一挺，轻机枪八挺，步枪二百五十余支。子弹万余发。（二）冀东八路军六日在谢庄子攻击过路蒋军军运汽车，计焚毁汽车八辆，缴获步枪自行车等物，并俘排长以下十二人，毙伤蒋军九十人。
