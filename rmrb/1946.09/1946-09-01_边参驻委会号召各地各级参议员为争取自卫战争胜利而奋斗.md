　　【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】The Standing Committee of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly sent a letter on the 27th of last month to senators at all levels and county councilors throughout the border region, calling on them to strive for victory in the war of self-defense. The original letter is as follows:

　　To All Senators and County Councilors of the Border Region:

　　Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the territory and sovereignty of our motherland, colluding with American imperialist elements for military assistance, and launching a large-scale war of national subjugation. Our border region's soldiers—the Eighth Route Army, local armed forces, militia, and self-defense forces—are fighting heroically on the front lines to defend the border region and to protect peace and democracy, and have already achieved brilliant victories. The people of the entire border region, regardless of gender or age, have been fully mobilized to support the front lines, organizing vast teams for combat support, transportation, stretcher-bearing, medical assistance, and eliminating traitors, and propaganda, working day and night.

　　Senators and County Councilors: We are the representatives of the people. At this time when the democratic cause is facing serious threats, how should we fulfill our responsibilities so as not to fail the people's trust! Therefore, we propose:

　　1. Based on the August 15th call of the "Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China," the August 19th reprint in the *People's Daily* of the *Liberation Daily* editorial "The People of All Liberated Areas Mobilize to Crush Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive," and the August 21st emergency call of the "Border Region Government," deeply publicize and explain, expose the American imperialist elements' plot to colonize China and the heinous crimes of the traitorous head Chiang Kai-shek in selling out the country and slaughtering the people.

　　2. Point out the concrete conditions for the inevitable victory of the patriotic war of self-defense, dispel all illusions, strengthen the people's confidence in victory, and inspire the people to launch an even broader and greater surge of participation in the war and a movement for production and frugality.

　　3. Set an example by actively assisting the masses in the land reform movement of anti-traitors and speaking out against grievances, and automatically participate in all production and logistical work, doing our best to help the masses, and influencing the masses with our actions. Strive wholeheartedly for the victory of the war.

　　4. Set an example, urging the people to economize on food and clothing, accumulate wealth, and use it to guarantee military and civilian supplies. Even if it is just a little bit of work, a grain of rice, or a thread of cloth, as long as it is beneficial to the people and related to the war of self-defense, we must resolutely do it.

　　Senators and County Councilors: We earnestly hope that you will create brilliant examples of serving the people in your respective regions. Fight on! Victory will surely be ours.

　　边参驻委会号召各地各级参议员为争取自卫战争胜利而奋斗
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区参议会驻委会于上月二十七日致函全边区各级参议员暨各县议员，号召为争取自卫战争的胜利而奋斗。原函如下：全边区参议员暨各县议员们：
    蒋介石出卖祖国的领土主权，勾结美帝国主义分子的军事援助，发动大规模的亡国内战。我边区子弟兵——八路军、地方武装、民兵、自卫队，正在前线上为保卫边区，保卫和平民主而英勇战斗，并且已经获得了辉煌的胜利。全边区人民，不分男女老少，已经总动员起来，为了支援前线，组织广大的参战队，运输队，担架队，救护队，除奸队，宣传队，都在昼夜不停的工作着。
    各位参议员暨各县议员们：我们是人民的代表，值兹民主事业遭受严重威胁之时，应如何克尽职责，以期不负人民之付托！因此，我们提议：
    一、根据八月十五日“中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局”号召。八月十九日《人民日报》转载：“全解放区人民动员起来，粉碎蒋介石的进攻”的《解放日报》社论及八月二十一日“边区政府”的紧急号召。深入宣传解释，揭发美帝国主义分子企图殖民地化中国的阴谋与汉奸卖国贼头子蒋介石出卖祖国，屠杀人民的滔天罪行。
    二、指出爱国自卫战争必然胜利的具体条件，破除一切幻想，坚定人民胜利信心，启发人民开展更广泛更巨大的参战热潮与生产节约运动。
    三、以身作则，积极帮助群众反奸诉苦的翻身运动，并自动参加一切生产与后勤工作，尽自己的能力帮助群众，用自己的行动影响群众。全心全意为争取战争胜利而努力。
    四、以身作则，推动人民，节衣缩食，积蓄财富，借以保证军需民食。那怕是一点一滴的工作，一米一线的物资，只要于人民有利，于自卫战争有关，我们一定要坚决做下去。
    各位参议员暨各县议员们：我们殷切盼望着你们在各地区创造出为人民服务的光辉范例。奋斗吧！胜利一定是我们的。
