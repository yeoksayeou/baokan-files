From the 20th to the 25th of last month, with the cooperation of the local militia, the division launched a heroic self-defense battle against the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in strongholds on both sides of the western section of the Jiaoji Railway. It once recovered Zouping City and liberated eight fortified strongholds such as Wenzu Town. It killed and wounded more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and captured more than 1,400 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including Liu Shizhen, the regimental commander of the Provisional 15th Division of the 96th Army, and seized more than 20 artillery pieces and more than 1,000 rifles and machine guns, creating brilliant self-defense battle achievements in two months. A certain company of a certain regiment of the division climbed up the blockhouse with unparalleled bravery and agility, destroyed the central large blockhouse in Wenzu Town, which the Chiang Kai-shek troops considered indestructible, and forced more than 100 Chiang Kai-shek troops, including a deputy battalion commander, to lay down their weapons, bringing the entire battle to a victorious conclusion before dawn. It was specially awarded the title of combat model company. The telegram called on the troops in the entire region to learn from the Qian Division, further develop their combat enthusiasm, not to be arrogant, not to be careless, to give the invaders a merciless blow of annihilation, and to strive for the early arrival of a peaceful situation.
