Many comrades also donated their personal savings and production income to the public. Comrade Chen Zhixian of the Judicial Police said: Chiang Kai-shek is launching a large-scale offensive against our Taiyue District, and the people are facing even greater difficulties. I don't want the cotton-padded clothes issued to me by the public this year. Send them to the soldiers at the front! He also donated 2,200 yuan in production bonuses to the public.
