　　Rationally Distributing the Fruits of Struggle
    Jubilation in En Village, Jiaozuo City
    People's Armed Forces Successfully Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] Comrade Ruiqun of the Jiaozuo City Farmers' Association reported that the rational distribution of the fruits of struggle in the mass movement in En Village has led to progress in the work. The two main experiences in the distribution are: one is democratic discussion through the mass line, and the other is distribution according to need. When distributing the fruits of struggle in this village, the masses were first asked to report what each household urgently needed most, and then everyone participated in the discussion to study specific distribution methods. Finally, a consensus was reached to adopt the principle of "distributing what is needed." Seventeen extremely poor households had no land, and some even lacked houses and pots. Everyone distributed 60 mu of land, two houses, and 12 pots to them, as well as some cotton and clothing. For the 133 poor peasant households, who had relatively little land and some lacked livestock and farm tools, everyone supplemented them with 59 mu of land, 12 heads of livestock (five families shared one), and 34 farm tools, as well as some cotton and clothing. The 11 middle peasant households all said that they had enough land to cultivate (a total of 136 mu), so, according to their requests, 29 pieces of clothing, nine pots, two cabinets, and one mule (shared by seven households) and one cart were distributed to them. Another bankrupt rich peasant requested a pot and two pieces of clothing, and to share livestock with the middle peasants, and the masses generously agreed. Some households who had been extorted in the past and suffered great losses did not participate in the struggle, but now they also requested a share of the fruits. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed to distribute to them according to their requests. As a result, the whole village shouted a common slogan: "Farmers all over the world are one family, unite and liberate ourselves together."
    After the distribution of the fruits, the masses in the whole village said it was fair and reasonable, expressing boundless joy. Crowds of people came and went on the streets, all wearing new clothes, and said when they met: "This is liberation!" "I have never worn new clothes in my life!"
    The traitors, local bullies, secret agents, and landlords who had been overthrown were secretly plotting to murder the cadres. The Farmers' Association discovered this and immediately many people automatically ran to the district office overnight to collect guns and grenades, proposing the slogan "Use open guns to deal with dark guns." As a result, the people's armed forces—the militia—were successfully established.
    In order to defend the fruits of struggle, more than 20 people automatically joined the Farmers' Association, and women also demanded to be organized, determined to "fight to the end!"

　　合理分配斗争果实
    焦作市恩村一片欢欣
    群众武装顺利建立
    【本报讯】焦作市农会瑞群同志报导恩村群众运动中合理分配斗争果实，使工作获得进展。分配的两个主要经验：一个是群众路线的民主讨论，一个是按需要分配。该村在分配斗争果实时，首先让群众自报一下，看各户最迫切需要什么，然后让大家都来参加讨论，研究具体分配办法。最后一致决定以“需要什么分什么”为原则。十七户赤贫没有土地，有几户连房子、锅都没有，大家就分给他们六十亩地、两座房、锅十二口，还有些棉花衣服等。贫农一三三户，土地比较少，有的缺牲口农具，大家就补给他们土地五十九亩，牲口十二头（五家合养一头），农具三十四件，另补一些棉花、衣服等。中农十一户，都说自己土地够种（共有土地一三六亩），于是，依其要求，分配给衣服二十九件，锅九口，柜二个，骡一头（七户合养）大车一辆。另一破产富农要求分给他锅一口、衣二件，与中农合养牲口，群众都慷慨答应了。有些过去被敲诈，受过很大损失的户，未参加斗争，此时也要求分些果实，经大家讨论，最后也一致同意依其要求分给他们。于是全村喊出一个共同口号：“天下农民是一家，团结起来，大家翻身”。
    果实分配后，全村群众都说公平合理，表现了无限欢欣，大街上来来往往的人群，都穿着新衣服，见面就说：“这可翻身啦！”“咱一辈子还没穿过新衣裳哩！”
    被斗倒的汉奸恶霸特务地主们暗中策划着想谋害干部，农会发觉了，立即有好些人自动连夜跑到区公所去领枪、领手榴弹，提出“以明枪对付黑枪”的口号。于是群众武装——民兵顺利的建立起来。
    为保卫斗争果实，有二十多人自动参加农会，妇女也要求组织起来，决心要“干到底！”
