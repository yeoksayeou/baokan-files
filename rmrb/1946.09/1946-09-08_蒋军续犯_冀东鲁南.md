　　Chiang Troops Continue Offensives
　　Eastern Hebei and Southern Shandong
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 5th] On August 18th, eight warships of unknown nationality arrived in Qinhuangdao, fully loaded with Chiang troops and light and heavy weapons. Five of them landed that afternoon, and the other three landed on the 29th. The Chiang troops of the 62nd Division (military reorganization) from Qinhuangdao along the Beining Railway reinforced Luanxian. After capturing @cheng, the location of the 13th Administrative Office of the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area on the 31st, they continued to capture Leting County, a liberated area, on the 1st.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tengxian, 5th] In the middle section of the Jinpu Railway, on both sides of the Grand Canal and Weishan Lake, the Chiang troops continue to attack the Southern Shandong Liberated Area, having already occupied Taierzhuang and attempting to continue their offensive against Yixian and Zaozhuang. They also appear to be planning to join forces with the puppet Wu Huawen troops entrenched in Yanzhou to open up the Jinpu Railway section from Yanzhou to Lincheng. On the front lines of the Grand Canal, a main force of the 37th Army of the Chiang troops, numbering about two thousand, advancing north along the Tai (erzhuang)-Zhao (dun) road, occupied Taierzhuang on the morning of the 2nd after suffering heavy casualties. In addition, a force of over two thousand from the 37th Division (now reorganized into a brigade) of the same army crossed the Grand Canal on the same day and occupied Malantun, 15 miles northwest of Taierzhuang, and more than ten nearby villages. These two routes of Chiang troops are actively building fortifications, attempting to continue their northward advance on Yixian City and Zaozhuang. On the Weishan Lake front, over two thousand Chiang troops under Feng Zigu and Wu Xiaoshan, who had occupied Peixian City, also advanced north on the 2nd, occupying Longgu, more than 20 miles north of the city. The remaining forces are concentrated in Guantun, five miles outside the city, attempting to cross Weishan Lake to the east and invade Xiazhen. In addition, the 88th Army (now reorganized into a division) under Fang Xianjue, which is gathered southwest of Peixian City, is secretly crossing Weishan Lake, attempting to cooperate with the Chiang troops entrenched in Lincheng to advance on Zixian along the Jinpu Railway. The puppet Wu Huawen troops, isolated in Yanzhou, in order to coordinate with the offensive of the Chiang troops on the southern front, also led over a thousand people with seven vehicles on the 2nd, launching harassment attacks in three directions: northeast, south, and north of the city. They were repelled by local militias and fled back into the city on the same day.
