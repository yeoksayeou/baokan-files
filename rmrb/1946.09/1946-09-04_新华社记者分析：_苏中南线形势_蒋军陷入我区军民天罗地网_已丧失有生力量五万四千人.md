Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 1st – A Xinhua News Agency reporter analyzes the current situation on the southern front of Jiangsu: The Suzhong self-defense war has lasted for a month and a half. A total of seven brigades and ten traffic police corps of the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops have been completely annihilated. The invading Chiang Kai-shek troops have lost more than 54,000 in effective strength, accounting for more than half of their total force. The first round of the "military showdown" on the southern front of Central China has yielded a clear result. Looking at the overall war situation, it has the following characteristics:

First, large-scale mobile warfare. Suzhong is located on the coast of the Yangtze River, with crisscrossing highways and accessible waterways, which is convenient for Chiang's troops to attack and also convenient for us to transfer. Chiang's troops launched an offensive on July 13, occupied Rugao on July 23, and Hai'an on August 2. In less than ten days, they penetrated a hundred miles. On August 22, our army captured Dingbao and Linzi, more than 30 li southeast of Rugao, and in less than ten days suddenly appeared behind Chiang's troops. Large-scale retreats and large-scale advances made the enemy lose sight of one thing while attending to another, and be attacked from both sides. Wherever Chiang's troops went, they raped, looted, and burned, forcing the people to resist. The New Fourth Army appeared on the flanks and rear of Chiang's troops, rescuing the people from their suffering and being welcomed everywhere. The deeper Chiang's troops went, the more they were trapped in the tight net of the army and people in the Liberated Areas. The Suzhong campaign proves that after the people's army eliminates the enemy's effective strength, many lost lands can be recovered today. The victory of Suzhong is precisely the victory of the strategic policy of mobile warfare.

The second is the mobile cooperation of local militia and the main force. Local armed militias persisted in guerrilla warfare in the areas occupied by Chiang's troops, constantly attacking and harassing Chiang's troops, and destroying and cutting off their transportation routes, making them trapped in strongholds and daring not to easily harass them. For example, on August 1, a unit of the local corps ambushed between Linzi and Dingbao and intercepted 400 boxes of ammunition from the enemy and burned 9 vehicles. On July 22, the Jingjiang militia intercepted 17 ships of medicines from Chiang's troops near Ningjie City and captured more than 60 people.

Third, Chiang's army commanders initially despised the New Fourth Army, and later became confused. For example, Chiang's 49th Division (military restructuring) went deep into the enemy after occupying Linzi, with a weak rear, and as a result was surrounded by the New Fourth Army in southeastern Rugao. Its division headquarters and the entire 26th Brigade were wiped out. Its deputy division commander (former deputy army commander) Wang Kejun died in battle. Recently, the New Fourth Army counterattacked and recovered Dingbao and Linzi, and another 5,000 Chiang's troops were wiped out. Chiang's troops in Rugao were threatened from both sides and were at a loss. They wanted to gather the forces trapped in Rugao and Huangqiao to boost their morale, but before they could converge, they were blocked and surrounded by the New Fourth Army separately, and Chiang's troops were wiped out by more than 15,000 people.

Fourth, low morale and internal contradictions within Chiang's army. The vast majority of lower-level officers and soldiers of Chiang's army were deceived into attacking the Liberated Areas. In the battle, once surrounded by the New Fourth Army, they laid down their weapons one after another. Among the more than 54,000 Chiang's troops annihilated, 30,000 laid down their weapons. At the same time, the invading Chiang's troops used miscellaneous troops as the vanguard, such as the 49th Division, which was the old Northeast Army, the 65th Division, which was the Guangdong Army Yu Hanmou's unit, and the New 7th Brigade, which was the Sichuan Army. These troops were unwilling to be Chiang Kai-shek's sacrifices in the civil war. Some of the liberated soldiers, under the education of the New Fourth Army, recognized Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to eliminate dissidents and turned their guns to fight the reactionaries. When Chiang's troops attacked, they used their American-made planes and artillery to inflict unprecedented disasters on the people, which also increased some difficulties for the New Fourth Army. But the key to victory or defeat does not lie in weapons, but in the soldiers who control the weapons.

    苏中南线形势
    蒋军陷入我区军民天罗地网 
    已丧失有生力量五万四千人
    【新华社淮阴一日电】华中新华社记者分析目前苏中南线形势：苏中自卫战迄今一月有半，总计进犯蒋军七个旅及十个交通警察总队全部溃灭，进犯蒋军已丧失有生力量五万四千余人，占其总兵力一半以上。华中南线“武力决赛”的第一回合已见分晓。纵观此次战局，约有如下特点：
    第一，大兵团运动战。苏中地处江海之滨，公路纵横，水道畅达，便于蒋军进攻，亦便于我转移。蒋军七月十三日发动进攻，二十三日占如皋，八月二日占海安，时未兼旬，深入百里。八月二十二日，我军一举攻克如皋东南三十余里之丁堡、林梓，又未兼旬突然出现于蒋军后方。大踏步的后退，亦大踏步的前进，使对方顾此失彼，腹背受敌，蒋军所到之处，奸淫烧杀，人民被迫反抗。新四军出现于蒋军侧后，解人民于倒悬，处处受到欢迎。蒋军愈深入愈益陷于解放区军民的天罗地网。苏中战役证明：人民的军队在消灭进犯者有生力量后，许多失去的土地今天可以收回。苏中之捷，正是运动战战略方针之胜利。
    其次是地方民兵与主力军机动配合。地方武装民兵在蒋军侵占区就地坚持游击，不断袭击困扰蒋军，破坏断绝其交通运输路线，使之困守据点，不敢轻易出扰。例如：八月一日地方兵团一部设伏林梓丁堡间截获将军弹药四百箱，焚烧汽车九辆。七月二十二日，靖江民兵在宁界市附近截获蒋军药品十七船，俘虏六十余人。
    第三，蒋军指挥官初则轻视新四军，后则迷乱。如蒋军四十九师（军改）于占领林梓后，孤军深入，后方空虚，结果在如皋东南陷入新四军包围。其师指挥部及二十六旅全部就歼。其副师长（原副军长）王克俊即于是役阵亡。最近新四军反击收复丁堡林梓，蒋军又有五千就歼。如皋蒋军腹背遭受威胁，手足无措，乃欲集结困守如皋、黄桥两地兵力，以壮声势，然尚未会合即遭新四军分别堵击包围，蒋军再被歼灭一万五千人以上。
    第四，蒋军士气低落和内部矛盾。蒋军下级官兵绝大部分是被欺骗来进攻解放区的，战斗中一被新四军包围就纷纷放下武器，被歼蒋军五万四千余人中，放下武器者即达三万人。同时，进犯蒋军以杂牌军当头阵，如四十九师为旧东北军，六十五师为广东军余汉谋部，新七旅为川军，这些部队都不愿作蒋介石的内战牺牲品，部分被解放的士兵在新四军教育之下认识了蒋介石消灭异己的阴谋，即掉转枪口向反动派作战。蒋军于进攻时利用其美制飞机大炮猛烈火力，人民遭受空前灾难，亦增加新四军若干困难。但决定胜负的并不在于武器，而是在于掌握武器的士兵。
