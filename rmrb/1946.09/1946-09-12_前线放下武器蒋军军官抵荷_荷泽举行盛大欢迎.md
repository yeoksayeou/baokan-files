Surrendered Kuomintang Military Officers Arrive in Heze
　　Heze Holds Grand Welcome

　　[Heze, September 9th report from our newspaper] Zhao Xitian, the commander of the Kuomintang Third Division (formerly commander of the Tenth Army), and his party, who laid down their arms on the Heze front, arrived in Heze yesterday. His unit was annihilated by our army in the Taiyan and Fanyan areas between Heze and Kaocheng.

　　[Heze, September 9th report from our newspaper] The first group of Kuomintang soldiers and political workers who laid down their arms in the Longhai Campaign have now arrived at the military officer training regiment under the military region, including 27 officers of the rank of colonel or higher and chiefs of sections or higher-level political workers, and 292 officers of the rank of lieutenant or lower and political workers below the level of section chief. On the 7th of this month, the military officer training regiment held a grand welcoming meeting. Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, sent a representative, Deputy Division Commander Zhou Shuyi, to express his condolences to the former Northwest Army officers who had laid down their arms. Deputy Division Commander Zhou introduced the events of General Gao Shuxun's uprising in Handan last year, when he stood with the people, and stated: Due to the long journey, he did not bring many valuable gifts, but only brought a revolutionary gift, which is the ardent hope of all officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army: "Oppose civil war, strive for peace, and work together for an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!" After the meeting, the military region's Combat Friendship Troupe performed plays such as "Everyone is Happy" to add to the festivities.
