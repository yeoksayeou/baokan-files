　　Determined to Participate in the Construction of the Liberated Area
    Renowned Professor Chen Jinkun Moves to Zhangjiakou
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] Mr. Chen Jinkun, a famous professor from Beiping, arrived safely in Zhangjiakou with his entire family a few days ago. Mr. Chen is a 60-year-old legal expert who has served as a law professor at Peking University, Chaoyang University, and other universities. His reputation is widespread, and he has taught students all over the country. Mr. Chen yearns for peace and democracy and has worked tirelessly for it, which has aroused the jealousy of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary authorities. On April 21st of this year, when he attended a speech meeting held by the Beiping All Circles National Assembly Election Promotion Association in Zhongshan Park, he was beaten by Kuomintang secret agents, but Mr. Chen was awe-inspiring and unmoved. He often said to people: "I will certainly not be intimidated by a beating." While recuperating from his injuries, he still wrote articles for democratic and progressive publications such as the Beiping *Liberation Daily*, calling for peace and democracy. When the *Liberation Daily* was shut down, Mr. Chen became even more hateful of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In June of this year, Mr. Chen visited Yan'an and Zhangjiakou successively. From his on-the-spot observation, he decided to move his entire family to the Liberated Area to participate in construction and strive for China's peace, democracy, and independence. Mr. Chen firmly stated to reporters: Although I am already 60 years old, I hope to live another 20 years to serve the Chinese people. After Mr. Chen arrived in Zhangjiakou, all circles here expressed their welcome and are scheduled to hold a grand welcome meeting on the 18th.

　　决心参加解放区建设工作
    名教授陈瑾昆迁张垣
    【新华社张家口十八日电】北平名教授陈瑾昆先生于日前偕同全家由北平安抵张市。陈先生为六十高龄之法学专家，历任北大、朝阳等大学法律教授，名震遐迩，桃李遍全国。陈先生渴求和平民主，努力不懈，致遭蒋介石反动当局之忌。本年四月二十一日出席北平各界国大选举协进会所主持之中山公园讲演会时，遭国民党特务殴伤，但陈先生正气凛然，不为所动。辄语人曰：“我决不是一顿拳头所能吓倒。”在养伤中，仍为北平解放报等民主进步刊物著文呼吁和平民主，及至解放报被封，先生对国民党反动派更为憎恨，本年六月陈先生曾先后访问延安张垣，从实地观察中，决心全家迁往解放区参加建设工作，为中国之和平民主独立而奋斗。陈先生坚决向记者表示：余虽年已六十，但愿再活廿年，为中国人民服务。陈先生抵张后，此间各界均表欢迎，定于十八日举行欢迎盛会。
