　　Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Kuomintang authorities recently secretly ordered all major and minor schools to investigate and ostracize progressive professors and teachers, attempting to further control school education. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Education established a "Investigation and Statistics Office" special agent organ at the beginning of this month, headed by Yang Huaxiu, and secretly ordered the Yunnan provincial middle schools at the end of last month to strictly investigate the ideology of teachers employed this term. At the same time, they instructed that a portion of good teachers from each school in the last semester should not be hired. In Shanghai universities, more than 20 professors who participated in the Democratic League were unreasonably dismissed by the authorities last month. In Nanjing, at Central University alone, many famous professors who were respected by students, such as Yang Hui, Lu Jiye, and Chen Baichen, have been successively and unjustifiably dismissed. In Chongqing, after the principals of various primary schools were trained during the summer vacation, as many as a thousand primary school teachers were dismissed, most of whom were capable but usually considered to be more active outside the school. Foreign teachers in Chengdu have also been ostracized and dismissed. This behavior of the Kuomintang authorities in destroying teaching has aroused great dissatisfaction among professors and students in Nanjing and Shanghai. Students at Central University in Nanjing will make a statement. Mr. Ai Fo, an old professor at Central University and an authority in Chinese psychology, has resigned due to dissatisfaction with the school.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to a Chongqing dispatch: The local education authorities, in order to control the thoughts of primary school students, have verbally notified public and private primary schools in the city to universally implement the "Baojia System" from this semester onwards. The entire school is divided into "experimental villages," with the principal or director of teaching serving as "village head," and the class leaders of each class and grade serving as "Baojia chiefs." The "Bao chiefs" and "Jia chiefs" are appointed by the "village head," and the "joint responsibility system" is implemented when necessary.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: The Kuomintang authorities in Chongqing officially implemented the fascist police district system on the 1st of this month, dividing the city into six districts and classifying "left-wing elements," Democratic League members, and Communist Party members as special households. It was decided that spot checks would be carried out at night with the "cooperation of all parties." Changsha has also decided to implement the police district system, with each Bao divided into one district and each district assigned a police officer. From the 14th of last month, the military police and constabulary in Changsha jointly conducted a general household check for five days, and more than 300 people were arrested. In addition, the Xuzhou authorities have recently implemented the Baojia system and have arrested three to four hundred citizens.

    【新华社二十一日电】国民党当局近密令各大中小学校，调查及排挤进步教授教员，企图进一步控制学校教育。云南省教育厅已于本月初成立一“调查统计室”特务机关，由杨华秀负责，并于上月底密令滇省各省立中学校方严嘱本期聘任教师务严格调查其思想，同时指令不得聘请上学期各校一部分好教师。在上海各大学内，上月即有二十余位参加民主同盟之教授被当局无理解聘，南京仅中央大学一校，即有素为学生爱戴的名教授杨晦、卢冀野、陈白尘等多人已被先后无理解聘。在重庆，各小学校长于暑期集训后，各校小学教师被解聘者竟达千人之多，其中多半为有能力而平时被认为在校外活动较多者。成都外籍教师亦多被排挤而被解聘。国民党当局此种摧残教学的行为，已引起京沪教授学生极大不满。南京中大学生将有所表示。中大老教授中国心理学界权威艾佛先生已因对校方不满而辞职。
