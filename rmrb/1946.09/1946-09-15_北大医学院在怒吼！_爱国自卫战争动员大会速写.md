　　Peking University Medical College Roars!
    A Sketch of the Patriotic Self-Defense War Mobilization Rally
    Chen Keming
    On the plaza of Peking University Medical College, more than two hundred and fifty pure hearts filled with ardor were beating, issuing a heroic roar for righteous and sacred patriotic self-defense.
    "Wherever the reactionaries attack, we will defend ourselves there.
    Wherever the reactionaries launch a civil war, we will call for their destruction there!"
    The songs of self-defense exploded in all directions like cannonballs.
    Instructor Li Qin-fang was the first to jump onto the stage: "Today's situation is even more serious than the 'July 7th' Incident nine years ago... We must not be paralyzed... We must save the nation from peril... Resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war... We should immediately respond to the call of the Central Bureau and take practical action!"
    Then, instructors Zhao Qingsen and Xu Tongfei, who had recently arrived from the rear, also roared in succession, analyzing the current situation, the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves, and pointing out that the final victory belongs to the people.
    At this time, the students could no longer contain their resentment, shouting loudly: "Resolutely defend ourselves!" "Strive for democracy!" "Oppose the aggression of the American reactionaries against China!" "We want to go to the front!" The roars shook the heavens and the earth.
    Immediately afterwards, Lv Fengqi, a student from the Military Medicine Department, said: "Today, the Kuomintang is drawing their knives on us... We must shout, we must cry, we must take practical action! As long as the superiors allow it, we will immediately go to the front to serve..." Everyone shouted slogans frantically again.
    Jin Youzhi uttered his full of grief and indignation in a sorrowful tone: "...The fruits of the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance have now been completely sold out by Chiang Kai-shek from heaven to earth... We cannot stand idly by and watch the Chinese people being killed by them. We must roar, we must roar to the people of the world, we must roar to the reactionaries!
    ...Today is a moment of life and death. There are only two paths before us: to submit to the enemy's butcher knife or to rise up in self-defense... We should unite as one and strive forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party..."
    Liu Fangmei, a female student who had just come from Beiping, shouted even louder: "This is the first time in my life that I can freely and openly express my opinions. In the Kuomintang-controlled area of civil war, I had to remain silent, but today I want to shout! I want to condemn the Kuomintang reactionaries..."
    Finally, she proposed that female students should learn from the spirit of the women participating in the war in the Taiyue Military Region and bravely support the front lines.
    ...One person finished speaking, and another jumped onto the stage, the tragic roars firing like a string of firecrackers.
    "Although my skills are not proficient, I can be an assistant and treat the wounded soldiers!"
    "Although I am a freshman, I can carry the wounded!"
    "Although I am a girl, I can take care of the wounded soldiers and wash clothes!"
    "We want to go to the front!"
    "We swear to fight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy!..."
    "Long live the victory of the patriotic self-defense war..."
    "Long live the Chinese nation..."
    The roar of Peking University Medical College will merge with the roar of the 140 million people in the Liberated Areas into a thunderous sound, playing the triumphant march for the patriotic self-defense war!
    August 27th, in Xingtai

　　北大医学院在怒吼！
    爱国自卫战争动员大会速写
    陈克明
    北大医学院的广场上，二百五十多颗纯洁且充满了热血的心在跳动着，他们为正义与圣神的爱国自卫，发出了雄壮的怒吼。
    “反动派在那里进攻，我们便在那里自卫。
    反动派在那里发动内战，我们便叫他在那里灭亡！”
    自卫的歌声，像一颗颗炮弹炸向四方。
    李沁舫教员第一个跳到讲台上：“今天的情势比九年前的“七七”还严重……我们绝不能麻痹……我们要挽救民族的危亡……坚决反对蒋介石的卖国内战……我们应立即响应中央局的号召，实际行动起来”！
    接着，从大后方新来不久的赵庆森与徐彤斐两教员亦相继大吼，他们分析了当前时局，敌我力量的对比，并指出最后的胜利属于人民。
    同学们这时再也遏止不住自己的愤恨，高声地喊着：“坚决自卫”“争取民主”！“反对美国反动派对中国的侵略！”“我们要到前线去”！吼声震撼了天地。
    紧接着军医科的吕凤岐同学说：“今天国民党向我们头上开刀……我们一定要喊，要叫，要实际行动起来！只要上级允许，我们马上到前线去服务……。”大家又疯狂似的呼着口号。
    金有志同学用着沉痛音调吐出满腔的悲愤：“……我们人民八年抗战换来的果实，现在从天上到地下被蒋介石出卖得干干净净……我们不能眼睁睁的看着中国人民被他们杀死，我们要怒吼，要向全世界人民怒吼，要向反动派们怒吼！
    ……今天是生死的关头，横在我们面前只有两条路，屈服于敌人屠刀，或奋起自卫……我们应团结一致，在中国共产党的领导下，努力前进。……”
    新从北平来的女同学刘方美更大声疾呼：“这是我生平第一次能自由公开的发表我的意见。在国民党统治区内战，我只好沉默，但今天我要喊了！我要治国民党反动派的罪……”
    最后提出：女同学们应该学习太岳军区妇女参战的精神，奋勇支援前线。
    ……一个讲完一个又跟着就跳上台去，悲壮的吼声，像连珠炮似的发射着。
    “我的技术虽不熟，可以当助手，医治负伤战士”！
    “我虽是新生可以抬伤兵”！
    “我虽是女生，我能照护伤兵员，洗衣服”！
    “我们要到前线去”！
    “誓为独立，和平，民主奋斗到底！……”
    “爱国自卫战争胜利万岁……”
    “中华民族万万岁……”
    北大医学院的吼怒将与解放区一万万四千万人民的吼怒汇成一声巨雷，为爱国自卫战争奏出胜利的凯曲！
    八月二十七日于邢台
