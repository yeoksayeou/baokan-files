    The Fifth Company was stationed in Gengyu, Zhaocheng. One day, they were boiling water. After boiling for a while, they opened the pot lid and suddenly there were mung beans in the pot. This was very strange. Some comrades said, "When we went out just now, the villagers wanted to cook, so they put in mung beans. Let's find another pot to boil the water." Some comrades suggested letting the villagers come back and drink it. While they were arguing, the landlady, old lady Zhang, came in and said with a smile, "I put it in. You have been fighting all day and are very hot. Is it enough to just drink boiled water? It's good to drink some mung bean water." The comrades of the Fifth Company were unwilling. They remembered that the common people had been ruined by Yan Xishan and had nothing to eat or drink, and they were reluctant to drink the mung bean water. "Old Yan has made you suffer, keep the mung beans as food... let's just do this, you use this pot of water for cooking, I'll find another pot to boil water." Old lady Zhang refused, she ignored them, and in a hurry, hid two pots in the house across the street, muttering, "Let's see what you boil?" Suddenly she looked up and saw the entering child, Wang Sheng, and told him about this. Wang Sheng became even more anxious when he heard this. "Mother, mother, there are so many people, how can this little bit of mung beans be enough?..." After he finished speaking, he quietly poured two bowls of mung beans into the pot. Later, old lady Zhang and Wang Sheng argued with each other because the Eighth Route Army refused to drink the mung bean water, and the comrades of the Fifth Company finally drank it. Soon they were going to the front line. Old lady Zhang said with a smile, "Mung bean water can only quench your thirst at home, what will you do on the front line? Wang Sheng, let's pick all the pomegranates." As old lady Zhang spoke, she began to pick them. The comrades of the Fifth Company advised them not to pick them, and wait until they were ripe. Old lady Zhang said, "By the time they are ripe, you will be fighting somewhere else."

　　绿豆水
　　维进
    五连在赵城耿峪住，有一天烧开水，烧了一会，揭开锅盖忽然锅里有了绿豆，这很奇怪，有的同志说：“刚才咱们出去的时候，老乡要做饭，所以放了绿豆，另找锅烧吧。”有的同志主张让老乡回来喝了，正在嚷吵着，房东张老太太进来了，笑着说：“这是我放的，你们打了一天仗，热坏了，喝开水这顶事么？喝点绿豆水好。”五连的同志不愿意，他们想起了老百姓被阎锡山糟踏得没汔没喝，舍不得喝绿豆水，“老阎害的你们吃没吃，绿豆留下顶粮……，就这样吧，这锅水你作了饭，俺另找锅烧开水”。张老太太那里肯依呢，她不答理，气的忙到对面的房子里，把两口锅藏起来，喃喃地说：“这可看你烧个甚？”忽然抬头看见进来的小孩旺生，就把这件事情告了他，旺生一听更着急了，“娘，娘，人这样多，这点绿豆，那里够呢？……”他说完了悄悄端了两碗绿豆倒在锅里。后来张老太太，旺生因为八路军不喝生气吵起来，五连同志才喝了。很快他们要上火线去，张老太太她笑着说：“绿豆水只能在家止渴，到火线上怎么办哪？旺生咱们把石榴都摘下来。”张老太太说着就动手去摘，五连同志劝他们不要摘，等熟了再说，张老太太说：“等熟了，你们又不知那里打仗去了”。
