Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Chongqing dispatch: The Yunnan People's Association for Peace and Democracy issued a statement on August 29th, exposing the Kuomintang authorities' great deception in handling the Li-Wen case. The statement said: This city's newspaper on the 27th reported that at the same time as the "execution" of the two criminals in the Wen-Li case, two robbers, Qiu Rongchang and Liu Mingfa, who were escorted by the Special Service Brigade of the Aviation Commission to the Garrison Headquarters, were also executed. However, 300,000 citizens of Kunming know that only two people were executed on that day, and there were no two executions of four people. Even women and children know that Qiu and Liu were used to replace the two real culprits, Tang and Li. Moreover, this punishment of criminals is a deception and only concerns the Wen case, while the Li case is ignored. It is well known that one of the criminals in the Li case is indeed Li Chengye, but the public security organs and Gu Zhutong are silent about Li Chengye and do not interrogate him, fearing that Li will reveal the real secrets during the interrogation. This is because Li Chengye is a member of the "Democratic Freedom League," not as "obedient" as a soldier. Moreover, his execution of the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu was originally induced and coerced, and the bonus of 500,000 yuan was not fully received. The association requests that representatives from the five parties of the Political Consultative Conference organize an investigation and interrogation agency to investigate and interrogate the instigators of the Li-Wen case, and transfer criminals such as Li Chengye to Beijing for public trial and punishment according to law. At that time, representatives of the Political Consultative Conference will supervise the government to effectively abolish the special service agencies and ensure the safety of the lives of people from all parties.

　　云南人民争取和平民主协会揭露
    所谓闻案两凶枪决原是国民党大骗局
    【新华社延安十八日电】渝讯：云南人民争取和平民主协会于八月廿九日发表文告，揭露国民党当局处理李闻案之大骗局。该文告称：此间廿七日报载“枪决”闻李案两凶犯之同时，又枪决航委会特务旅解送警备部之抢犯仇荣昌刘明法二人，昆市卅万市民无不知晓当日只仅一次枪决二人，并无两次枪决四人之事实，虽妇孺亦知以仇刘二人代替汤李二凶犯正法。且此次惩凶故属骗局，亦仅属闻案，对李案则搁置不理。李案凶犯之一确系李成业乃众所周知，而治安机关及顾祝对李成业讳莫如深，不事审讯，惟恐审讯李犯不得已时说出真正秘密。盖李成业系“民主自由大同盟”盟员之一，“服从性”不如军人，且其执行暗杀李公朴先生原系利诱及胁迫，奖金五十万又未完全到手。该会要求由政协五方代表组织侦查审讯机关侦审李闻案主使人，并将李成业等凶犯移京公审依法惩凶，届时由政协代表监督政府切实取消特务机关，保障各党派人士生命安全。
