　　Qingnian Minbing Guo Chengfa of Lingchuan
　　Cleverly Shot and Killed a Die-Hard Special Agent
　　County Headquarters Issued a Circular Commending Him
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Guo Chengfa, a clever and brave militiaman from Jishan Village in Lingchuan, shot and killed a Chiang Kai-shek special agent. The county headquarters issued a special circular commending him. On the 9th of this month, Guo Chengfa and Guo Shenglai, two militiamen from Jishan Village, were escorting Guo Zixiang and Jiang Laihong, members of a special agent assassination squad, to the county. Jiang feigned a leg ailment, using a cane for support, and repeatedly delayed the journey. When they reached Beisiqu Village, it was already late. Jiang took advantage of Guo Shenglai opening his bag to get dressed, striking Shenglai's head with a thick stick, causing him to immediately faint. At this critical moment, Guo Chengfa, a 20-year-old youth militiaman, was clever and brave. He immediately fired two shots at Jiang, killing him. The militiamen of Beisiqu Village, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and, together with Guo Chengfa, escorted the other suspect, Guo Zixiang, to the county. The county headquarters, recognizing that Comrade Guo Chengfa was clever and brave, swift and decisive, overcame difficulties, and completed the mission, and that the Beisiqu Village militiamen quickly assembled and acted upon hearing the gunfire, cooperating to complete the mission, issued a circular of commendation and awarded Comrades Guo Chengfa and Guo Shenglai 300 yuan in local currency.
