　　The New World of the Northeast
    Xinhua News Agency Communication
    After passing the boundary of tyranny, filth, and poverty centered on Shenyang and Changchun in the Northeast, one arrives at another new world, occupying six-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population of the entire Northeast. This place is filled with freedom and abundance, and the former slaves have become masters. Forty-six percent of the enemy and puppet land in Nenjiang Province has already been distributed to landless farmers. In Gannan County, 10,000 farming households have received over 28,000 hectares of land, making it one of the dozens of counties in the Northeast that have achieved "land to the tiller." Throughout Heilongjiang Province, cultivated land is expanding; Qingcheng averages ten hectares of land per household. The joyous mood of the emancipated farmers is beyond description. Farmers in Bao County, Songjiang Province, who were allocated enemy and puppet land, mobilized their entire families for enthusiastic production. Sun Kuangang, who had farmed all his life, received land and went to see the boundary stakes himself, immediately pulling weeds in the field. Song Xifa, whose arm bone was broken by the enemy and who previously owned no land, received 30 mu of land for his family of four this time and immediately bought paper to write a contract himself: "Contract writer Song Xifa, now for the sake of recovering blood debts, receives a section of cultivated land." In the three counties of Andong, Baiquan, and Anshan in Heilongjiang Province, known as the granary of northern Manchuria, the sorghum is particularly robust this year, and the wheat and soybeans are all bountiful. Farmers say with joy: "Every household has surplus grain, and life will be good from now on."
    Reasonable land reform is the source of strength and the grand road to creating a prosperous countryside. In Andong Province, 80,000 people have been organized. Douma Village in Zhuanghe County, Andong Province, with over 2,800 people, has been completely transformed. Farmers who used to fill their stomachs with soybean cakes now eat corn cakes three times a day. In the past, there was not a single pig in the whole village, but now every household raises pigs and engages in weaving, which has become a common sideline. Tens of millions of farmers in the Northeast are grateful for the wise decision of the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. All Japanese and puppet properties within the Northeast—"development land," "Manchurian development land," and the land of major traitors—were immediately confiscated and distributed to landless and land-poor farmers. At the same time, the people's right to property and land is guaranteed; no one's land may be illegally occupied except for the land of enemy puppets and major traitors. In Langtou District, Andong, farming households received 3,800 mu of enemy and puppet land, with each person receiving 8 to 12 mu. When they received their land certificates, they celebrated joyfully as if it were a festival, wearing new clothes, with stilt walkers, yangko dancers, and the sound of gongs and drums. Thousands of farmers immediately put the land certificates in their close-fitting, secure pockets, and then formed a line, carrying a giant statue of Chairman Mao in a jubilant parade.
    Accompanying the new look of the countryside, cities and industries are also prospering. Andong City, on the banks of the Yalu River, with a population of [censored], is a symbol of this prosperity. The traitorous puppet governor of Andong Province, Cao Chengzong, and others, were long ago publicly tried and executed by the people. The city now has nearly 200 state-owned and private factories and workshops in operation, employing over 20,000 workers, including the Yalu River Paper Mill and the Andong Textile Factory, each with over 2,500 workers. There are approximately 2,000 rickshaws and horse-drawn carts in the city for people to ride. Workers here are happy in their work; the highest wage is 15 jin of grain per day, the average is 10 jin, and the lowest is 5 jin. They are full of labor enthusiasm, and production efficiency has generally increased eight to tenfold in competitions. Most factories have established night schools and clubs. There are now more than 50 cooperatives and stores run by the workers themselves in the city. In the past six months, over 100 workers have been elected as district and street chiefs, 29 workers have been elected as provincial and municipal councilors, and over 300 people have been elected as department heads, section chiefs, and factory management committee members in factories. In Qiqihar City, on the banks of the Nenjiang River, the democratic government first used millions of jin of grain to relieve the poor and unemployed workers and then organized trade between the city and the countryside. Now, nearly a thousand carts transport grain from the surrounding villages into Qiqihar every day and bring back cloth and daily necessities. Currently, prices in Qiqihar are: millet, 2 to 3 yuan per jin; sorghum, 1 to 3 yuan per jin; cloth, 70 yuan per chi. Finally, in order to build their permanent home, the people of Qiqihar are reasonably reducing rents. The First District of the city decided that the maximum rent should not exceed twice the price of the house before the Japanese surrender; the Third District decided to reduce rents and ensure payment; the municipal government also distributed enemy and puppet houses to poor citizens and families of martyrs without compensation. In addition, there are Harbin, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang... all newly built cities, where there is no housing shortage, unemployment, or famine.
    Democratic governments in various parts of the Northeast are making various efforts to improve the living conditions of the people of the Northeast. The Heilongjiang Province authorities are particularly encouraging and cultivating flax production, striving to enable people to use flax to spin yarn and weave cloth to replace the lack of cotton planting. Furthermore, Mi Jicang, an old flax worker, is researching and manufacturing flax spinning machines, which are expected to spin 720 jin of flax yarn per machine per month. The province is also starting to mine the coal mines in the Mala Mountain area to solve the fuel problem for the people and factories. In another two months, it will be able to produce 300 tons of coal per day. The Chahayang Sluice Gate, the largest water conservancy project in northern Manchuria, located in the northwest of Nenjiang Province, was completed at the end of April after eight months of arduous work, with an irrigation area of over 150,000 mu. Since the Beian Power Plant resumed power generation, many towns along the 400 li between Qiqihar and Beian have been brightly lit. In these harmonious cities and villages in eastern Manchuria, western Manchuria, and northern Manchuria, there are more than a dozen railways running through them.
    Another great achievement of this land is the people's democratic power. The masses are fully capable of exercising democracy. Ten thousand organized farmers in Zhendong County re-elected the county, district, and township administrative bodies. At the village election meeting in Tonghe Village, Qiqihar, the masses said: "Traitors and running dogs who worked for the Japanese cannot be elected today!" In the various provincial governments, Gao Chongmin, one of the leaders of the Democratic League and the Northeast National Salvation General Association, was elected as the chairman of Andong Province. Chen Xianzhou, an old Kuomintang member, was elected as the speaker of the Andong Provincial Provisional Assembly. Che Xiangchen, a staunch anti-Japanese non-partisan veteran educator, was elected as the director of the department. Han Youtong is an outstanding female member of the Democratic League. The Northeast People's Government has also promoted the principle of national autonomy, and a Mongolian Political Affairs Department has been specially set up in Nenjiang Province, where Mongolians live in mixed communities. Wherever Mongolians live, they have established Mongolian Autonomous Movement Federation branches themselves. In Xing'an and Temuduo Bagan [censored], where Mongolians account for nearly half of the province's population, they were elected as the chairman of the provincial government and the speaker of the provincial assembly, respectively. The Northeast Provincial and Municipal Representative Joint Conference held on August 7 unanimously adopted the establishment of the "Northeast Provincial and Municipal Administrative Joint Office," which is the highest body to promote the democratic construction of the Northeast provinces and cities and unify the administration of the Northeast provinces. Lin Feng, who was elected as the chairman, added: "This is still a temporary agency in a transitional period. We also look forward to the establishment of a democratic united government with local autonomy."
    Cultural and educational undertakings are also developing smoothly. Qiqihar originally had 18 municipal and private schools, accommodating more than 13,000 students. Due to the prosperity of the broad masses of people, there is an urgent need for culture, and the city has added 27 new primary schools. All public schools are free of charge. The original middle and primary schools in other places have been restored, and private schools are being established. Northeast University is the highest institution of learning in the Northeast, full of an atmosphere of free research and emphasis on practical spirit. Enrollment is extremely enthusiastic. The president is Zhang Xuesi, and the vice presidents are Bai Xiqing, an authority in the Northeast medical community, and writer Shu Qun. Teachers include Zhang Ruxin, Jiang Juchen, Xiao Jun, Lü Ji, and Zhang Geng. More than 20 kinds of newspapers and more than 20 kinds of magazines have been published in the Northeast Liberated Area. There are no restrictions such as censorship, restriction on printing, restriction on sales, and restriction on mailing. Individuals can freely publish newspapers. There are currently seven Chinese newspapers in Harbin. Except for the Northeast Daily, which is a Communist Party newspaper, the other six are privately owned enterprises independently operated by local gentry and merchants.

　　东北的新天地
    新华社通讯
    在东北过了以沈阳和长春为中心的横暴、污浊和贫困的界限，就到了另一个新天地，它占有全东北六分之五的土地和四分之三的人口，这里充满着自由和丰足，旧日的奴隶都成了主人。嫩江省百分之四十六的敌伪土地，已经分配给无地耕种的农民。甘南县一万家农户，得到二万八千余垧土地，它是东北几十个达到“耕者有其田”的县份之一。整个黑龙江省，耕地都在扩大，庆城平均每户拥有土地十垧。翻身后的农民的喜悦心情是无可言喻的。松江省宝县农民，分得了敌伪的土地，都全家出动热情生产。干了一辈子农活的孙宽刚，得到了地亲自去看地桩，马上到地里拔草。被敌人打断臂骨，过去没有一分地的宋喜发，这次一家四口人，分得三十亩地，马上买了纸亲手写契约：“立契约人宋喜发，今为讨还血债，分得熟地一段。”被称为北满谷仓的黑省安东、拜泉、安山三县，今年高粱特别粗壮，小麦和大豆都是丰收。农民欣喜地说：“家家都有余粮，今后日子可过好了。”
    合理的土地改革，是力量的源泉，是创造繁荣农村的康壮大道。安东省已有八万群众组织起来。安东省庄河县，拥有二千八百余人的逗马村，焕然改观。过去以豆饼充饥的农民，现在一天三顿包米饼子，过去全村没有一只猪，现在家家养猪纺织，成为普遍副业。几千万东北农民，都感谢中国共产党东北局英明的决定。所有东北境内一切日伪地产——“开拓地”，“满拓地”及大汉奸土地，立即予以没收，分配给无地及少地的农民。同时，保证人民的财权和地权，除敌伪大汉奸的土地以外，其他任何人土地不得非法侵占。安东浪头区，农户分得三千八百亩敌伪土地，每人都分得八亩至十二亩。他们在领取土地照的时候，欢快庆祝，好像过节日一样，都穿上新衣服，高跷队、秧歌队，敲着锣鼓。数千农民领到地照立即放在贴身的、牢固的衣袋里，于是排成队伍抬着毛主席巨像，欢呼游行。
    伴随着农村新面貌，城市和工业也在胜兴，鸭绿江边拥有××人口的安东市，它是正在繁荣的象征。卖国贼伪安东省长曹承宗等，早被人民公审枪决了。该市现已有公私营工厂和作坊近二百家开工生产，就业工人二万余名，其中鸭绿江造纸厂，安东纺织厂，各有工人二千五百余名。全市约有人力车和马车二千余辆供人乘坐。这里工人是幸福的工作，最高工资每天得粮十五斤，一般的十斤，最低五斤。他们充满劳动热情，在竞赛中，生产效率普遍提高八倍到十倍。多数工厂都已设立夜校和俱乐部。全市现有五十多个由工人自己办的合作社和商店。在过去半年中，有了百多个工人被选为区和街长，廿九个工人被选为省市参议员，三百多人被选为工厂的处长科长及工厂管理委员。另一个嫩江边的齐齐哈尔市，民主政府首先以数百万斤粮食救济贫民和失业工人，然后组织城市和乡村的交易，现在每天有近千辆大车从四乡把粮食运入齐市，又带回布匹和日用必需品。目前齐市物价：小米每斤二至三元；高粱每斤一至三元；布每尺七十元。齐市人民，最后为着建立他们永久的家，就合理地进行减房租。市一区决定最高租额不得超过日寇投降前房价的二倍；三区决定减低房租保证交租；市政府并把敌伪房屋无偿分给贫苦市民和抗属。此外还有哈尔滨、佳木斯、牡丹江…………都是些刚建的城市，这里没有房荒失业和饥馑。
    东北各地民主政府，正作种种努力试图改进东北人民的生活状况。黑龙江省当局，特别鼓励与培植亚麻出产，努力使人民用亚麻纺线织布，以代替棉植的缺乏。并且由老亚麻工人米积仓研究制造亚麻纺织机，预计每架机器月可纺麻线七百二十斤。该省同时着手开采马拉山一带煤矿，以解决人民和工厂的燃料，再过两个月就可日出炭三百吨。位于嫩江省西北的北满最大水利工程查哈阳水闸，经过八个月艰难的工程，已于四月底竣工，灌溉面积达十五万亩以上。自从北安发电厂恢复发电，使齐市至北安沿线四百余里间的许多城镇，都灯光明亮。在东满、西满和北满这些和谐的城市和乡村中，贯穿着十多条铁路。
    这块天地的另一个巨大的成就，是人民的民主政权，群众完全善于运用民主。镇东县十万有组织的农民，改选了县区乡行政机构。齐齐哈尔通合村举行村选大会时，大众说：“给日本干过事的汉奸走狗今天不能当选！”在各个省政权中，民主同盟和东北救亡总会负责人之一高崇民，当选为安东省主席。老国民党员陈先舟，当选为安东省临参会议长，车向忱是一位坚决抗日的无党派的老平民教育家，他被选为厅长。韩幽桐是位杰出的民主同盟女盟员。东北人民政权还发扬了民族自治原则，在有蒙民杂居的嫩江省特设蒙政厅，凡有蒙民居住的地方，都由蒙民自己成立蒙古自治运动联合会支会。在蒙民占全省人口几及半数的兴安的和特木多巴根×××都分别被选为省府主席和省参议长。八月七日举行的——东北各省代表联合会，一致通过成立“东北各省市行政联合办事处”，这是推进东北各省市民主建设，统一东北各省行政的最高机关。当选为主席的林枫氏补充说：“这还是过渡时期的临时性质的机构，我们还期待地方自治的民主的联合政府的成立。”
    文化教育事业亦畅顺发展。齐齐哈尔原有十八个市立与私立学校，容纳学生一万三千余人，由于广大群众生活富裕，迫切要求文化，全市乃新增二十七所小学。所有公立学校均不收费，其他各地原有之中小学校都已恢复，民办学校正在设立。东北大学是东北最高学府，充满着自由研究空气与注重实用精神，入学者极为踊跃。校长张学思，副校长为东北医学界权威的白希清氏和作家舒群；任教者有张如心、姜君辰、萧军、吕骥、张庚诸氏。在东北解放区已出版报纸廿余种，杂志二十余种。这里没有审查、限印、限卖、限寄等任何限制，私人都可自由出版报纸。哈尔滨现有中文报纸七家，除东北日报为共产党报纸外，其余六家都是当地绅商独立经营的私人企业。
