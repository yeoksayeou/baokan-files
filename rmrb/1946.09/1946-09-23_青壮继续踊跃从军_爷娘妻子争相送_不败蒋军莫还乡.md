[This Dispatch from Our Wei County Office on the 19th] In Hebei South, to protect the fruits of their victory after their emancipation, the peasants continue to enthusiastically join the army. In Zaoqiang, another 200 young men have joined the army; in Ji County, 205 young men from the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th districts have joined the army at the same time; in Qiu County's 2nd district, at an anti-civil war rally, 30 young men signed up on the spot, and 20 demobilized soldiers enthusiastically returned to their units. 500 militiamen are standing by to go to the front lines to cooperate with the regular army in combat, 2,000 peasants are actively preparing to go to the front lines to carry stretchers and transport supplies, and more than 18,000 peasants have proposed to work hard in the rear to help the families of soldiers with the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and to solve all the difficulties of the soldiers' families. In the upsurge of joining the army, many models of women urging their husbands to join the army and parents urging their children to join the army have emerged. Sun Shidong, a veteran from Qianziliong Village in Zaoqiang, personally persuaded five fellow villagers to join the army. Cai Guizhi, the director of the women's association in Tangjialin Village, 2nd district, personally sent her husband to the front line. Zhu Zhangshi, an old lady in her fifties from Zhupinglou Village, Mr. Nan Laoshan from Xihuangpu Village, 4th district, and Mr. Wang Yisui, who is in his sixties from Dazhangpu Village, 2nd district of Guantao, have successively sent their sons to the battlefield. Before leaving, Mr. Nan Laoshan said: "If Chiang Kai-shek is not defeated, the poor cannot be emancipated, and you must not come back."

[Another Dispatch] Merchants in various places have launched a donation campaign to support the front lines and defend the liberated areas. In Nangong's business community, over 75,000 yuan has been donated in the past few days. Influenced by this, a donation campaign has been launched among the citizens of Nangong. More than a dozen businesses in Daying Town, a fur distribution center in Zaoqiang, each donated 1,000 yuan, and those who followed suit were very enthusiastic, donating 26,500 yuan in half an hour. Businesses in the Chengguan district of Guantao have also donated generously. The donation campaign is currently underway in various places.
