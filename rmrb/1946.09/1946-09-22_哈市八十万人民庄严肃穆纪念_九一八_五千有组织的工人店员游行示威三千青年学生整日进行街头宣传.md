Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 18th: Amidst the drizzle and cold wind, the 800,000 people of Harbin solemnly commemorated the 15th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. Five thousand organized workers and shop assistants spontaneously gathered and marched, and three thousand young students conducted street propaganda all day long. Schools and factories held commemorative meetings, informal discussions, and lectures. Today, the streets of Harbin are covered with wall newspapers, cartoons, and street poems. People on the streets are talking about Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, Li Zhaolin, and the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. The Harbin Youth League, Dongda Songjiang Cultural Troupe, and more than 20 propaganda teams from ten elementary schools gathered early in Zhaolin Park. After passing a telegram to Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, and all democratic人士, calling for an end to the civil war and demanding the establishment of a coalition government, they dispersed to carry out propaganda activities. On the banks of the Songhua River and in the streets and squares, citizens, disregarding the drizzle, crowded together tightly. When the living newspaper street plays such as "Since September 18th" and "Put Down Your Whip" were performed, the audience threw banknotes to the compatriots who played the role of Northeasterners who had fled to Guannei after the "September 18th" Incident, selling songs and begging. The streets were filled with crowds. The Northeast Film Crew, riding in trucks, captured every scene. The whole city was filled with the songs and drumbeats of Yangko teams and stilt walkers all day long.

More than 5,000 workers and shop assistants who had implemented profit-sharing held a grand rally on the Central Stage in Daowai. This was a grand review of the organized shop assistants and workers in Harbin. Representatives of workers and shop assistants made speeches one after another, expressing their joy after their liberation and sincerely thanking the Communist Party, the Democratic Allied Army, and the heroic Soviet Red Army for their assistance. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC, attended and gave a speech, pointing out that workers have strength when they unite. Today, thousands of workers in Harbin are organized, which is a large working team that can organize the 800,000 people of Harbin into an invincible force against the Kuomintang reactionaries. The workers spontaneously lined up for a demonstration march, the mighty procession passing through the streets, issuing the majestic call to "Smash the Reactionary Attack."

　　哈市八十万人民庄严肃穆纪念“九一八”
    五千有组织的工人店员游行示威三千青年学生整日进行街头宣传
    【新华社哈尔滨十八日电】在细雨寒风中，哈市八十万人民庄严肃穆的纪念“九一八”十五周年。五千名有组织的工人店员自动集会游行，三千青年学生整日进行街头宣传。学校工厂分别举行纪念会、漫谈会、讲演会，今日哈市街头遍贴壁报漫画街头诗等，大街上人们都谈论着杨靖宇、赵尚志、李兆麟和抗日联军。哈市青年联盟东大松江文工团以及十个小学的廿多个宣传队，很早就集合在兆麟公园里，通过致电宋庆龄、何香凝及一切民主人士呼吁制止内战，要求成立联合政府之通电后，即分散进行宣传活动。在松花江边、在大街广场上，市民们不顾细雨纷飞紧紧的挤拥着，他们当“九一八以来”“放下你的鞭子”等活报街头剧演出时，观众纷纷向剧中扮演“九一八”后东北流亡关内卖唱讨乞的同胞投出钞票，街头到处拥塞着人群。东北电影工作团坐着卡车猎取每一个镜头，全市终日充满秧歌队高跷队的歌声和锣鼓声。
    五千余实行过分红制的工人店员，则在道外中央舞台举行隆重的集会，这是哈市有组织的店员工人的一次大检阅。工人店员代表一一发表演说，表示翻身后的喜悦，衷心感谢共产党和民主联军以及英勇的苏联红军的援助。中共东北中央局书记彭真同志出席讲演，提出工人们团结起来就有力量。今天哈市几千工人有了组织，这就是一个大工作队，可以把哈尔滨八十万人民组织起来成为对抗国民党反动派的一个不可战胜的力量。工人们自动列队游行示威，壮大的行列穿过各个街道，发出“粉碎反动派进攻”的雄伟的呼声。
