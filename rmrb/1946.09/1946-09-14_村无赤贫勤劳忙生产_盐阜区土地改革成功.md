Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, September 11th: Special correspondent Sima Long reports: The land reform movement in the Fifth Sub-district of the Suwan Border Region (Yancheng-Funing Area) has achieved initial success. This area includes twelve new and old counties and cities, including Yancheng, Sheyang, Funing, Huai'an, Hongze, and Qingjiang City. Throughout the area, as a result of the struggle against traitors and local bullies and the reduction of rent and debt, a large amount of land has been transferred to farmers with little or no land. Approximately one million people (30% of the total population of 3.8 million) have participated in mass organizations such as labor unions, peasant associations, youth leagues, and women's federations. Farmers who have obtained land are diligently cultivating their fields before dawn, and the living standards of farmers have generally improved. In Shengwang Village, Yancheng, 13 out of 57 households previously relied on begging for a living; now each person has obtained two mu of land and has abandoned the beggar's life. In Yili Village, Funing East, five families slaughtered pigs and everyone ate meat during the Mid-Year Festival on July 15th; the total amount of meat consumed in the village more than doubled compared to last year, and they urgently demand improved cultural opportunities. In Zhaocun, Tongyang District, Sheyang (newly established county), Du Ermazi, who relied on a small boat to eke out a living for 58 years, has now received land and has sent two daughters to school simultaneously. In more than 3,000 villages throughout the sub-district, 10 to several dozen mu of land have been set aside as village school funds, and there is already a shortage of teachers in various places. Appropriate steps have been taken to rectify certain deviations that occurred during the movement, which infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. Organizationally, middle peasants have been absorbed into peasant associations to correct the closed-doorism of excluding middle peasants by some poor and landless peasants in some areas. Politically, education has been strengthened to explain that middle peasants are also exploited and are originally one family with poor and landless peasants and should work together. "Unity Meetings" and "Harmony Meetings" have been convened to eliminate estrangement. Economically, without undermining the vested interests of poor and landless peasants, various measures have been taken to subsidize the losses suffered by middle peasants, such as: (1) Distributing a portion of public land to middle peasants. (2) Redistributing a portion of the concealed land remeasured. (3) Distributing most or all of the autumn grain to middle peasants. (4) Allocating a portion of public grain to middle peasants. (5) Giving consideration to middle peasants when issuing agricultural loans. At the same time, a large-scale production movement is being launched to promote diligence in managing households and achieving self-sufficiency in food and clothing. The government will issue 12 million catties of agricultural loans to solve the difficulties of farmers who have newly obtained land in terms of plows and farm implements. In addition, 10 million catties of sideline loans will be issued to develop women's textile industry. One hundred and fifty cotton yarn and cloth exchange stations will be established in eleven counties, and it is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 women can be organized.

　　村无赤贫勤劳忙生产
    盐阜区土地改革成功
    【新华社淮阴十一日电】本社特派记者司马龙报导：苏皖边区第五分区（盐阜区）土地改革运动已获初步成功，该区包括盐城、射阳、阜宁、淮安、洪泽、清江市等十二个新旧县市，全区经过反奸反恶霸与减租清债结果，已有大量土地转入少地或无地农民手中，约有一百万（占全区总人口三百八十万的百分之三十）男女参加了工农青妇等群众组织。获得土地之农民不待天明即纷纷下地勤耕细作，农民生活普遍上升，盐城升王村五十七家中原有十三户靠求乞渡日，现每人得田二亩，已抛弃讨饭生涯。阜东益里村七月十五过节，杀猪五口家家吃肉，全村食肉量比去年超过两倍，他们迫切要求提高文化。射阳（新设县）通洋区赵村杜二麻子靠一只小船苦熬五十八年，今年得地翻身送两个女儿同时入学。全分区三千个以上村庄均各留下土地十亩至数十亩不等，作为开办村学基金，各地师资已感到供不应求。对于在运动中发生某些侵犯中农利益的偏向，已采取适当步骤，予以纠正。在组织上吸收中农参加农会，纠正部分地区贫雇农排斥中农之关门主义。在政治上加强教育，说明中农也是被剥削者，与贫雇农原是一家，应该携手合作，并召开“齐心会”“合心会”等消除隔阂，在经济上于不损害贫雇农既得利益原则下，采取各种办法以补助中农所受之损失，例如（一）将公田分一部分中农。（二）复又时丈出之隐瞒土地分一部分给中农。（三）秋粮分配时大部或全部分给中农。（四）拨一部分公粮给中农。（五）发放农贷时照顾中农。同时开展大生产运动，提倡勤劳治家，丰衣足食。政府将发放农业贷粮一千二百万斤，解决新获土地农民之耕牛农具困难，另外发放一千万斤副业贷粮，发展妇女纺织，将在十一个县内，成立一百五十个花纱布交换所，估计可组织妇女二十至三十万人。
