　　Yan Xishan Frantically Seizes Men for Military Service
    Taiyuan Citizens Flee in Droves
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 19th] Taiyuan youths have been constantly fleeing to the Liberated Areas recently. It is said that Yan Xishan is frantically seizing men for military service, and Taiyuan City has become a chaotic world. Men aged thirteen or fourteen to forty or fifty are finding it difficult to escape. For shop assistants and apprentices, the method of "one out of three" or "two out of five" is used to forcibly conscript soldiers. Shop owners are sending their assistants and apprentices home. On one day alone, at the end of August, as many as 3,700 young people fled from Taiyuan City to the villages in Yuci. On that day, more than 20 people were shot and arrested by Yan's army for resisting conscription. The people of Taiyuan's political evaluation of Yan Xishan is that he "is worse than the Japanese." Citizens said: "The vicious Yan Xishan has reached the end of his rope. He will soon be taking a plane to Japan again." Note: In 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China), Yan once stepped down and fled to Dalian under Japanese rule.

　　阎锡山疯狂搜捕壮丁
    太原市民纷纷逃亡
    【本报长治十九日电】太原青年近日不断逃来解放区。据称：阎锡山正大肆搜捕壮丁，太原市已成混乱世界。十三、四岁至四、五十岁男子均难幸免，对商店伙友则以三抽一、五抽二办法，强行派兵。各商店老板纷纷遣送伙友学徒回家。仅八月底某日一日间，由太原市逃往榆次四乡之青年即达三千七百人。是日因反抗抓丁而被阎军枪杀逮捕者达二十余人。太原人对阎锡山的政治评价是“赛过日本人”。市民们说：“穷凶极恶的阎锡山，已到穷途末路。他又快坐飞机往日本去了”。按：民国十九年，阎曾下野逃往日本统治下之大连。
