　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Reports from various sources: U.S. President Truman has recommended current U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Harriman, to succeed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce. Harriman plans to first travel from London to Paris to meet with Byrnes in the next day or two, and then return home. Harriman stated that he fully agrees with Truman and Byrnes' foreign policy. Note: Harriman was appointed by the late President Roosevelt as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union in October 1943, and only left office in March of this year. In March 1941, he was entrusted by Roosevelt to be the representative for the Lend-Lease Act in the United Kingdom. In September of the same year, he went to the Soviet Union with British Minister of Production, Beaverbrook, to discuss detailed measures for Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union. During his tenure in the Soviet Union, his attitude was quite good. After returning home from his post, his attitude changed in his report to Congress, agreeing to a "tough" stance towards the Soviet Union. Harriman is one of the giants of American railways and finance, and once served on the Business Advisory Council of the Department of Commerce, which often criticized Roosevelt's policies.

　　哈立曼继长商务部
    【新华社延安二十四日电】各方报导：美总统杜鲁门已推荐现任美驻英大使哈立曼继华莱士为商务部长，哈立曼拟于今明日由伦敦先赴巴黎与贝纳斯会晤，然后返国。哈立曼谈称：他完全同意杜鲁门与贝纳斯的外交政策。按：哈立曼一九四三年十月曾由故罗斯福总统任为驻苏大使，直至今年三月始去职。一九四一年三月他衔罗斯福之命，充驻英租借法案执行代表，同年九月偕英生产大臣卑维勃鲁克赴苏，讨论对苏租借详细办法。他在驻苏期间，态度尚好，御任回国后，在向国会报告中，态度改变，同意对苏“强硬”。哈立曼为美国铁路及财政巨头之一，曾任职商务部商业顾问委员会，该会对罗斯福政策多所批评。
