Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 17th: Jireliao report: Chiang's troops are currently invading the area between Zunhua, Pinggu, Jixian, and Xinglong, inside and outside the Great Wall, and fierce fighting is underway there. After the fall of the empty city of Chengde on August 28th, Chiang's troops used the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway and the Beiping-Liaoning Railway as baselines to expand their offensive on both sides of the railway. On one side, they attacked Longhua from the north of Chengde, and on the other, they attacked the areas on both banks of the Luan River from Changli and Luanxian. At the same time, they used the main force of ten divisions to attack the heartland between the two railways from both the north and the south, attempting to quickly eliminate the Eighth Route Army, control the entire Jireliao area, and establish a safe corridor connecting Northeast China and North China. However, the development of the war clearly shows that the Eighth Route Army was fully prepared strategically and tactically for the war in this area. They placed a certain number of troops on the front and flanks of Chiang's offensive lines, and in mobile warfare, after opportunistically inflicting casualties on Chiang's main forces, they systematically withdrew from several cities such as Lulong, Qian'an, Yutian, and Zunhua, and moved to favorable positions. Therefore, when Chiang's troops rushed forward aggressively, they were never able to find the main force of the Eighth Route Army to engage in a decisive battle, and naturally could not achieve the goal of annihilation. Instead, they often suffered counterattacks from the Eighth Route Army. For example, on the 4th, Chiang's troops invaded Xianghe and paid the price of more than 1,300 casualties. The 93rd Army was ambushed and had a battalion wiped out on the 4th while advancing south from Jianping. On the 5th, the 62nd Division (original army) of Chiang's troops in Changli attacked Funing and suffered more than 150 casualties. The Jireliao Military Region of the Chinese Communist Party has not yet issued a battle report, but if the losses of Chiang's troops during this period are statistically compiled, it will certainly be a considerable number. As a result, the cities occupied by Chiang's troops proved to be completely the same as Chengde: "No machines in the machine rooms, no goods in the warehouses." The frontline officers and soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were quite disappointed by this. According to a Chiang's troops platoon leader captured by the Eighth Route Army, several Chiang's troops battalion and regimental commanders believed that this kind of battle was not worth the loss. A widespread mass guerrilla war has been ignited throughout Jireliao. When Chiang's troops occupy several villages and towns and continue to advance, the defending troops behind, although building bunkers and fortifications to hold on, are often driven out or eliminated by the guerrillas and militiamen. In Qinglong north of Lengkou, and Taitouying and Yanheying northeast of Lulong, Chiang's troops occupied them for less than three days before they were taken back by local armed forces. The battle for 錛城 south of Luanxian can be considered a typical example of this kind of guerrilla warfare. The local militiamen laid a minefield in advance, and when Chiang's troops rashly advanced, they stepped on "booming" mines everywhere. After occupying 錛城 at the cost of more than a hundred lives, they were harassed by militiamen and guerrillas, and finally had to retreat to Luanxian city. Now, except for the two strongholds of Leting and Macheng, there is no trace of Chiang's troops in the area south of Luanxian. Therefore, Chiang's troops have occupied Chengde for twenty days, but in addition to controlling the main transportation lines and several towns, the vast countryside is still in the hands of the Eighth Route Army and the militia, which puts Chiang's troops in a very unfavorable situation. Because since he cannot eliminate the Eighth Route Army and the militia, he must use a large number of troops to protect his transportation lines and strongholds. According to military experts, guarding the two railway lines from Beiping to Jinzhou and from Beiping to Shanhaiguan alone requires at least seven or eight divisions, which will inevitably greatly weaken the ability to maneuver in future operations. Winter is a new threat to Chiang's troops, and the lack of food will become more and more serious. In particular, the Rehe area, after fourteen years of enslavement by the Japanese invaders, many places have become "no-man's land" where no grain is produced. After the Eighth Route Army liberated Chengde, it continuously transported grain from Zhangjiakou and the vast countryside of Hebei to Rehe for relief, but Chiang Kai-shek's troops did not have this condition. Although they may be able to get some supplements from the sea by American ships, it is a drop in the bucket and absolutely impossible to transport to every frontline stronghold. The local people have a saying: "We have a vast countryside, we will persist in a long-term guerrilla war, and see who is the final victor."

　　冀热辽军民运用运动游击战术
    长城内外到处打击进犯军       
    蒋军损兵折将占我空城严冬粮缺威胁更大
    【新华社张家口十七日电】冀热辽讯：蒋军正会犯长城内外遵化、平谷、蓟县、兴隆之间地区，激战在该处进行中。上月二十八日承德空城陷落后，蒋军即以锦承路和北宁路为基线向铁路两侧扩大进攻，一面由承德北犯隆化，并由昌黎滦县南犯滦河两岸地区，同时即以主力十师突由南北两面夹击两铁路线间的腹心地区，企图迅速消灭八路军，控制冀热辽全区，建立联系东北华北的安全走廊。但战事的发展，显见八路军对这一地区的战争无论在战略上与战术上都预有充分准备，他们以一定数量的部队留置在蒋军进攻线路的正面和两翼，在运动战中，相机杀伤蒋军主力后，有计划的撤离卢龙、迁安、玉田、遵化等若干城市，转移至有利阵地。所以当蒋军声势汹汹的向前猛扑时，始终找寻不到八路军的主力决战，自然也无法达到消灭的目的，而却常常遭到八路军的逆袭。如：四日蒋军侵占香河，曾付出一千三百余人的代价，九十三军四日由建平南犯途中被歼灭了一个营，昌黎蒋军六十二师（原军）五日进攻抚宁伤亡了百五十余人。中共冀热辽军区向未发表战绩公报，但如果把此一时间蒋军的损失加以统计，一定是个很可观的数目。而蒋军所侵占的城市，结果证明完全与承德一样，“机器房里没有机器，货栈里没有货物”，蒋介石部队的前线官兵对此颇为失望。据被八路军俘虏的蒋军一个排长说：若干蒋军营团长认为这种仗得不偿失。广大的群众性游击战争已在冀热辽地面普遍燃烧起来，当蒋军占领若干村镇而继续前进时，后面的守备部队虽然筑起碉堡工事固守，仍常被游击队民兵所驱逐或消灭。冷口以北的青龙、卢龙东北的台头营燕河营，蒋军占领不到三天，就被当地地方武装拿了回去。滦县南面锛城的争夺可为此种游击战的典型。该处民兵事先摆下地雷阵，当蒋军冒失前进时，到处踏响“轰轰”的地雷，在其以百余条生命占下锛城后，又遭到民兵游击队的困扰，终于不能不退回滦县城，现在滦县以南地区除乐亭马城两据点以外，再无蒋军踪迹。所以蒋军占领承德至今已二十天，但除控制主要交通干线和若干城镇外，广大乡村仍在八路军和民兵手中，这使蒋军处于很不利的情况。因为他既然不能消灭八路军和民兵，就要用很大兵力来保护自己的交通线和据点。据熟谙军事者称：光守备北平到锦州与北平到山海关两条铁路干线，至少得七八个师的兵力，今后作战的机动能力必然大大削弱。冬天对于蒋军是一个新的威胁，粮食的缺乏会愈来愈严重，其中尤其是热河地区经过日寇十四年奴役，好多地方都成为“无人区”，颗粮不产，八路军解放承德后，曾不断由张家口和河北的广大乡村向热河运粮接济，但蒋介石军队却没有这个条件，虽或能由美舰从海上得到若干补充，杯水车薪无济于事，而且绝对无法输到每一前线据点。当地人民流传着一句口头语：“我们有广大乡村，我们将坚持长期的游击战，看究竟谁是最后胜利者。”
