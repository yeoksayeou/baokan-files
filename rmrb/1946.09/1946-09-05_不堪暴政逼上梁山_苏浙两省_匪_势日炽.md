Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 31st: Shanghai News: Under the tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang government, "bandit" activity in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is intensifying. According to reports from Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao on July 19th, 20th, and 24th, in addition to the "pirates" gathering along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, the "lake bandits" of Taihu Lake and the "scattered bandits" in the vast area between Taihu Lake and the Yangtze River are growing in strength. Taihu Lake was a base for "lake bandits" for several years before the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, thousands of unemployed people, disbanded soldiers, and vagrants, driven by hunger and lack of clothing, gathered here again to make a living by looting, and Taihu Lake has become today's "Liangshan Marsh." Recently, water police from Wuxing and Pinghu have also defected with their weapons, further strengthening their forces. Their weapons include Japanese-style machine guns, American-made submachine guns, and Mauser pistols. It is said that some teams even have rocket launchers and mortars. Their area of ​​activity not only controls the entire waterway of Taihu Lake but also often appears in Suzhou, Wuxi, Wuxing and other places on the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. In the Wuxing area of ​​Zhejiang Province, some of the teams referred to as "bandits" get along well with the local residents, do not invade or disturb them, and issue tax tickets to collect fishing taxes, with tax tickets being issued as far as the vicinity of Wuxing city. The Zhejiang Provincial Government regards the "lake bandits" as a serious problem. Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, once put forward the slogan "Today, Zhejiang's top priority is to suppress bandits." Recently, 30 million yuan has been allocated to prepare for "encirclement and suppression," but it is reported that the "encirclement and suppression" plan faces great difficulties because the strength of the "lake bandits" cannot be underestimated. Taihu Lake is more than a hundred miles long and wide. The small islands and harbors around Dongting Mountain, where the "lake bandits" are based, are scattered and the terrain is complex. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish between "bandits" and civilians in many places, and Taihu Lake spans two provinces, so they strike here and flee there. Therefore, there is no confidence in the "encirclement and suppression." In addition, in the vast Jiangsu Province area northwest of Taihu Lake, "scattered bandits" are spread around Jintan, with Tao Lake as one of their bases. The Kuomintang authorities have sent heavy troops to garrison various places and launch suppression campaigns at any time. Not long ago, they organized a "joint suppression by five counties" including Jintan, but to no avail. Recently, they established a "Joint Defense Association of Four Counties, Jintan, Wujin, Yixing, and Piaoyang," but the "bandit" forces are becoming more ferocious.

　　不堪暴政逼上梁山
    苏浙两省“匪”势日炽
    【新华社延安三十一日电】上海航讯：在国民党政府的暴政下，苏浙两省“匪”势日炽。综合此间大公报七月十九、二十、二十四日消息，除浙东沿海“海盗”云集外，太湖的“湖匪”及太湖长江间广大地区的“散匪”声势日炽。太湖在抗战前若干年中即为“湖匪”的根据地，抗战胜利后大批失业人民、散兵、游勇数千人因衣食所迫又集结于此以劫掠为生，太湖遂成为现在的“梁山泊”。最近又有吴兴、平湖的水警挟械到此落草，力量愈加雄厚。他们的武器有日本式机关枪、美造冲锋枪及盒子炮等，据闻某些队伍尚有火箭炮迫击炮。他们的活动地区除扼制太湖的整个航路外，还常常出没于京沪杭铁路线上的苏州无锡及吴兴等地。在浙省吴兴方面被称为“匪”的一部分队伍，且与当地居民相处甚得，不相侵扰，并发行税票征收渔税，税票发行直达吴兴城厢附近。浙省府对于“湖匪”引为心腹大患，浙省主席沈鸿烈曾提出“今日浙江剿匪第一”的口号，最近拨款三千万元准备“进剿”，但据悉“进剿”计划面临极大困难，因“湖匪”实力不可轻视，太湖纵横百余里，“湖匪”所据的洞庭山周围小岛港湾星罗棋布地形复杂，加以很多地方“匪”民难分，且太湖横跨两省，此击彼窜，故对“进剿”殊无信心。另在太湖西北广大的苏省地区“散匪”，遍布金坛附近，洮湖为其据点之一。国民党当局曾派重兵驻防各地随时出剿，不久以前曾组织金坛等“五县会剿”，但毫无结果，最近又成立“金坛、武进、宜兴、漂阳四县联防会”，但“匪”势愈凶。
