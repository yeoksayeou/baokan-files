Liberation of Huo County
Lu Sheng

Huo County, which had been ravaged by the enemy and puppet regime for more than nine years, was finally liberated on the 23rd of this month. Huo County should have been liberated last year when the Japanese surrendered. However, Yan Xishan, the warlord of Shanxi who was obsessed with civil war, refused to let the people escape their suffering. Before the enemy had retreated, he sent personnel into the city and reorganized the puppet Huo County Brigade into the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Provincial Defense Division, with Xu Ziliang as the regimental commander. The puppet police force was reorganized into the Huo County Patriotic Corps, with the puppet county magistrate Cheng Xizhou concurrently serving as the corps commander. They ordered all merchants and residents in the city to build fortifications and bunkers, preparing for civil war. They built 45 open and hidden bunkers and dug a large moat two zhang deep and three zhang wide outside the city wall. Once these preparations were complete, they launched a gradual encroachment on our liberated areas, first occupying our Zhangjiabao, Shage Dabaobao, Zhaojiazhuang and other villages. Later, they built a second line of bunkers as a base for continued offensive operations. Over the past year, there have been as many as 200 armed grain robberies involving more than 300 people each time, and small-scale grain robberies have occurred almost daily. In each offensive, our district and village cadres were captured and killed. In particular, they absorbed the traitors, bullies, and war criminals from various villages to form a "Revenge Corps," which killed, set fires, raped, and plundered everywhere. In July of this year, they killed more than 40 people and captured more than 30 people in a single raid on the village of Duncun. The people of the entire county had reached the end of their endurance and demanded assistance from the Eighth Route Army.

On August 20th, our army, at the request of the people, launched a self-defense counterattack against the Yan puppet army in Huo County. Under the slogan of fighting to relieve the suffering of the people of Huo County, we swept away the Yan puppet forces in the large and small strongholds around the city, such as Dazhang and Xingjiaquan, with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The next day, our main force advanced to the city. The morale of the entire army was doubled. The entire Fifth Company handed over their saved vegetable money and food coupons to the regimental political department. Comrade Zhang Shiman handed over his eight-jin-four-liang rice coupon, 2,800 yuan, and a fountain pen to his superiors, saying, "I will certainly liberate Huo County for the people. If I sacrifice myself, these things should be used as Party dues." Comrade Liu Guifa, the squad leader of the First Squad, had been sick for three days. Everyone did not want him to go to the front line, but he handed over his fountain pen and other items to the Party cadre, saying, "It is most glorious to be able to sacrifice for the people and the Party. Even if I am sick, I will go."

At 5:00 p.m. on the 23rd, our artillery, infantry, and engineer heroes, illuminated by the setting sun, threw themselves into their positions. At the sound of a command, our artillery fired simultaneously at the 45 open and hidden bunkers in the city. The earth was immediately shaken by the loud noise. First, the largest bunker standing on the east city wall was hit by two shells and destroyed as black smoke rose. Then, the second one was destroyed... Soon, all 45 bunkers in the city were cleared by us. The infantry followed up in pursuit under the cover of artillery fire. At the same time, the engineers quickly cleared the mines on both sides of the outer moat and erected springboards. At this time, the remaining enemies in the hidden bunkers continued to throw grenades at us. In order to prevent the springboards from being blown up, we changed our approach and pushed soil into the moat from the sides, forming a slope. In an instant, the assault group, the grenade-throwing group, and the medical group crossed the outer moat together. The grenade-throwing groups from each regiment and company braved the artillery fire, and rows of grenades flew from under the city into the city. The stubborn enemies in the bunkers on the city wall were immediately thrown into chaos. Our ladder-erecting team raised the first ladder, and the 8th Squad of the 2nd Platoon was the first to climb the city wall.

The east city wall was completely under our control, and grenades were constantly thrown at the retreating enemy like raindrops. The enemies scurried around like little mice. In just 20 minutes, our army, in a magnificent manner, had all climbed onto the city wall. By this time, it was already dark. In order to quickly end the battle, our army immediately conducted a search in the city. By this time, the remaining die-hards had collapsed. Under the call of our righteousness, they laid down their weapons one after another, and the entire city was immediately liberated. In addition to those killed, the Yan puppet army captured included the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Provincial Defense Division, the 14th Local Security Regiment, and the Huo County Revenge Corps of the 12th Special Commissioner's Office, totaling more than 2,000 people.

　　解放霍县城
    鲁生
    被敌伪蹂躏九年多的霍县城，已于本月二十三日获得解放，本来霍县城在去年日寇投降的时候，就应该解放的，可是醉心内战的山西土皇帝阎锡山，不肯让人民就此摆脱苦难，当敌人未退之先，即派员入城，收编伪霍县联队为省防四十四师第三团，徐子良任团长。又将伪警备队编为霍县爱乡团，以伪县长成锡周兼团长，勒令全城商民修筑工事碉堡，准备内战，前后筑起明暗碉堡四十五座，并在城墙外面挖两丈深三丈宽的大壕，准备停当便向我解放区展开蚕食进攻，先将我张家堡、沙圪瘩堡、赵家庄等村占领。后又修筑第二道碉堡，作为继续进攻的基地。一年来，三百人以上的武装抢粮即达二百次之多，小股抢粮，几乎每天不断，并在每次进攻中，捕杀我区村干部，尤以吸收各村汉奸、恶霸、战争罪犯，组成“复仇团”，到处杀人放火，奸淫抢掠。今年七月间，至段村一次便杀死群众四十余人，捉走三十多人。全县人民，至此已忍无可忍，乃要求八路军给予援助。
    八月二十日，我军应人民之请，向霍县阎伪军实行自卫反击。在为解除霍县城民众痛苦而战的口号下，以秋风扫落叶之势，先将城周围的大小据点、大张、邢家泉等地的阎伪扫清。次日，我大军进至城下，全军士气百倍，五连全体把节省下的菜金、粮票交给团政治处。战士张世满同志把他的八斤四两米票，二千八百块钱和一支水笔交给上级，他说：“我一定为人民解放霍县城，如果牺牲了，这些东西就作为交党费。”一班长刘贵发同志病已三天，大家不让他上前线，他便把自己的水笔等物交给党负责同志说：“能为人民、为党牺牲，是最光荣的，有病也要去。”
    二十三日下午五时，我炮兵步兵工兵英雄们在夕阳映照下，纷纷投入阵地，一声令下，我炮兵齐向城内四十五个明暗碉堡发射，大地顿时为巨响所震撼。首先，屹立在东城墙上那个最大的碉堡为两发炮弹所命中，随着黑烟的升起而毁灭了。接着，第二个又毁灭了，……………不久，全城四十五个碉堡全为我肃清，步兵在炮火掩护下跟着向前追击。一面，工兵们迅速的肃清外壕两侧地雷，架搭跳板，这时，暗碉堡内残余敌人，仍不断向我投扔手榴弹，我为防止跳板被炸，改从壕侧推土入壕，筑成斜坡，顷刻突击组、投弹组、救护组便一齐越过外壕，各团各连投弹组冒着炮火轰击，一排排手榴弹由城下飞进城内，城墙上碉堡里的顽敌立刻混乱了，我架梯的竖起了第一个梯子，二排八班便首先登上城墙。
    东城墙上完全被我控制，手榴弹像雨点似的不断的向溃退的敌人撵去。敌人像小老鼠般到处乱窜，仅二十分钟，我军便以壮伟的姿态全部登上了城头，此时天已昏黑，我军为了迅速结束战斗，立即到城内进行搜索，残顽至此已溃不成军。在我正义感召之下，纷纷放下武器，全城立告解放。阎伪军除被击毙外俘虏的有省防军四十四师第三团，地方保安十四团，第十二专署霍县复仇团等共二千余人。
