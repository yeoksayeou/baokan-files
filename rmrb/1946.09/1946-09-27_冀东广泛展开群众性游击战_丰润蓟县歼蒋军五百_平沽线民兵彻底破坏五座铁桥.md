Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd (Delayed Dispatch) The Eighth Route Army local armed forces in eastern Hebei have been constantly attacking various locations recently, effectively striking at Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. On the evening of the 16th of this month, the Fengrun guerrilla force launched a strong attack on the Chiang troops in Xinjuntun, west of Tangshan. On the same day, when vehicles of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of Chiang's army were passing through Xiezhuangzi, southwest of Bangjun Town, Jixian County, they were ambushed by local armed forces, resulting in over 500 Chiang soldiers killed or wounded in both battles, and a large number of supplies were seized. Furthermore, the Chiang troops who invaded Bencheng (southwest of Luan County) on the 31st of last month suffered over 70 deaths from landmines in the suburbs. After entering the city, over 50 more were killed by landmines. That night, they were forced to bivouac in Zhangshikan and other villages in the western suburbs of the city. On September 14th, when these Chiang troops looted over 100 carts of grain and clothing and abandoned the city to flee back to Luan County, they passed through Hougan Village and were suddenly attacked by hundreds of militiamen lying in ambush there, who engaged in direct hand-to-hand combat. Many women also rushed to the scene with sticks and farm tools to assist in the battle, seizing the stolen clothing and grain. The Chiang troops, intimidated, abandoned the loot and fled in panic. Before they had traveled even a mile, they were ambushed again by the militia. At the sound of gunfire, the battalion commander, who was leading the way on a bicycle, was the first to fall from his bike. When the Chiang troops who invaded Siji Town on September 2nd continued their southward advance, they were contained for a day by thirteen militiamen using sparrow warfare tactics. By sunset, they dejectedly returned to the town.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th The Changping Local Corps, in coordination with the militia, successively destroyed seven large bunkers built by Chiang's troops at the entrance to the Ming Tombs, a famous historical site. These fortifications were distributed as three in Nanshan Village and four in Hetan Village (both more than ten li north of Changping). The local army and people attacked the aforementioned locations of the Chiang troops on the nights of November 12th, and before dawn on the 13th, they swiftly conquered all the bunkers in Nanshan Village in one fell swoop. On the 14th, they successively liberated Hetan Village and completely destroyed all the fortifications constructed by the Chiang troops. In both battles, the Chiang troops abandoned thirty-two corpses. Simultaneously, the militia along the Pinggu line completely destroyed five iron bridges between Shunyi and Huairou on the night of the 10th.
