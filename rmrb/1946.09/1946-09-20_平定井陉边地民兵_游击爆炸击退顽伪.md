　　Militia in the Border Area of Pingding and Jingxing
    Guerrilla Warfare and Explosions Repel Stubborn Puppets
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] Comrade Xu Weisan, director of the Armed Forces Committee of the First District of Jingxing, led the militia to actively wage guerrilla warfare near the strongholds of stubborn enemies and puppets during the mass emancipation movement, proactively safeguarding the smooth emancipation of the masses. On the 19th of last month, at 10:00 AM, he led the Seventh Battalion of the militia to secretly approach the puppet artillery tower in Yuzhuang. About halfway there, they first laid landmines on the road and then fired shots to lure the enemy out. As expected, the enemy puppets gave chase, and one of their plainclothes scouts at the head of the column was killed by a landmine. The rest dared not pursue further and retreated back to the artillery tower. Currently, to better conduct guerrilla warfare, a plan for killing the enemy has been specifically formulated: (1) In enemy demolition operations, form a flying demolition team to operate behind enemy lines, with irregular timing to ensure the death of at least two enemies. (2) For shooting battles, form a flying commando team to conduct ambushes, with daily situation assessments. (3) Dedicate time to mass mobilization, military training, and political classes.
    At dawn on the 17th of last month, more than 20 stubborn puppet soldiers from the Yujia artillery tower in Jingxing invaded Zhishakou in our district, attempting to seize grain, conscript laborers, and steal livestock to sabotage our emancipation movement. Our militia discovered their approach in advance and, after covering the masses' retreat, engaged the puppet soldiers in battle. After two puppet soldiers were wounded, they fled in disarray, and we suffered no losses.
    [Another report] The ×× village in the border area of Pingding is frequently harassed by Yan's puppet troops. During weeding, Yan's puppets invaded the village six times in ten days, forcing the masses to flee for their lives and hindering production. After discussions between village cadres and the masses, a militia was organized, and the cadres specifically divided the labor. On one hand, they organized the masses to clear the houses and fields, conduct organized retreats, and simultaneously promote an explosion campaign and sniper warfare to strengthen intelligence gathering. As a result, not only were people not captured, but losses of grain and supplies were also minimal. They scared the enemy and made them afraid to harass them easily. Because every time Yan's puppets went to the village, they were blown up and three to five were killed or wounded by landmines. Once, Yan's puppets retreated halfway and went to another village. The conscripted laborers in Chengguan all tried to run away when they heard they were going to ×× village. Everyone spread the word: "There are three thousand landmines buried in the river in ×× village. Not to mention people, even flies can't fly over it; if you go, you won't come back!" The specific organizational method of combining labor and military affairs in the village is as follows: the director of the village Armed Forces Committee and the instructor lead a number of capable militia members to monitor the enemy five miles ahead and carry out explosion operations, laying landmines on the roads the enemy would use. At daybreak, landmines were placed everywhere on the roads and doors in the village. When the enemy came and could not be stopped, they would cover the masses' retreat. In addition, the village chief and the chairman of the farmers' association led the masses in the rear to carry out production. All the men, women, old, and young in the village voluntarily participated in mutual aid groups. Based on the patterns of the enemy's departure time and direction, they engaged in production. When retreating, they also moved in groups. The whole village also established a unified system of life, waking up, cooking, eating, and working in the fields according to the sound of the bell. The disabled and sick lived with relatives in other villages. When evacuating, they planted landmines everywhere. Last month, when the enemy set out to the village, two Yan's puppets were killed and four were wounded by door mines. Under such a tight organization, Yan's puppets had no way. The masses victoriously completed the weeding work and protected their lives and property. At the same time, the mutual aid groups fostered rent and interest reduction in the course of combat and production. After discovering problems, they were resolved at the evening in the people's school, which further raised the armed consciousness of protecting their own interests. Everyone said, "The militia are our door gods. Without them, not to mention production, we can't even protect ourselves." Everyone voluntarily weeded 150 mu of land for the militia. The morale of the militia was also higher, and they wholeheartedly studied how to attack the invading Yan's puppets and protect themselves and the interests of the masses. Recently, they created a new way to bury landmines.

　　平定井陉边地民兵
    游击爆炸击退顽伪
    【本报长治讯】井陉一区武委会主任许畏三同志，在群众大翻身运动中，带领民兵在顽伪据点附近积极打游击，主动保卫群众顺利翻身。上月十九日，上午十时，他带领民兵七大队向榆庄伪炮台偷偷接近约里半路时，事先在路上埋好地雷，即打冷枪诱敌出来，果然敌伪追来，一触地雷，即将敌头前便衣一名炸死，其余则不敢前追，又退回炮台。目前为了更好的开展游击战，特订出杀敌计划：（一）在对敌爆破上，组成一个飞行爆破组，在敌人的后边进行活动，时间不定随时活动，保证炸死两个敌人。（二）射击战斗要组成飞行突击队，进行打埋伏战，每天有人下去了解情况。（三）有时间要参加群运、练兵、上政治课。
    上月十七日拂晓井陉于家炮台顽伪军二十余人，进犯我支沙口，企图抢粮抓丁拉牲口，破坏我翻身运动。事先为我民兵发觉，民兵掩护群众退却后，即与该伪军展开战斗，伪军被打伤二名后，狼狈逃跑，我无损失。
    【又讯】平定边沿区××村，常受阎伪军经常袭扰，在锄苗中，阎伪十天内即向该村进犯六次，群众每天忙着逃难不能生产，后经村干部与群众讨论，组织了民兵，干部又具体的分了工，一方面组织群众空舍清野，有组织的转移退却，同时并开展爆炸运动和冷枪战加强情报侦察。因而不但人没有被捉走，粮物也很少损失。并把敌人打怕了，不敢轻易出扰。因为阎伪每次到该村，都得让地雷炸死炸伤三五个。有一次，阎伪走到半路又返到其他村去，城关被抓民夫，一听说要到××村，都想法偷跑了，人人传说：“××村河里埋有三千个地雷，不用说人去，就是蝇也飞不过去，去就回不来了！”该村的劳武结合具体组织办法是：由村武委会主任指导员带领若干精干民兵，到五里地的前方监视敌人，并开展爆炸运动，把敌人来的路上都埋上地雷，天明时把村口路上、门上，到处都安上地雷，敌人来阻击不住时，就掩护群众退却；另外村长与农会主席在后方领导群众生产，全村男女老少都自愿参加了互助组，根据敌人出发时间和方向的规律，进行生产，退却转移时也以小组为单位。全村并订了统一的生活制度，按时听钟声起床、作饭、吃饭、地里作活，残废病人都在外村投亲居住。转移出来时，便把地雷到处埋上挂上，上月间敌人出发到该村即被门雷炸死阎伪两个，炸伤四个。在这样严密的组织下，阎伪毫无办法。群众胜利的完成了生产锄苗工作，保卫了生命财产。同时在战斗生产中以互助组为单位，酝酿减租减息，发现问题后，晚上即在民校解决，这样更提高了保卫自己利益的武装自觉，都说：“民兵可是咱们的顶门棍，要不就不用说生产，连人也保不住。”大家自愿的给民兵锄苗一百五十亩。民兵的情绪也更高起来，专心专意的研究如何打击进犯阎伪，保卫自己和群众的利益，最近他们又创造出一种新的埋雷办法。
