Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Paris dispatch: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, stated on the 5th that the Vietnamese representatives and the French representatives had held several meetings in Fontainebleau, but no progress had been made. Vietnam currently advocates that Vietnam be an autonomous unit within the French Union, such as an autonomous dominion of the British Commonwealth. However, France is unwilling to accept this minimum demand of Vietnam. Vietnam insists that Cochinchina should be included within the Vietnamese government, but France wants to make Cochinchina a part of the Vietnamese Federation, with a status equal to that of the Vietnamese government. Finally, Ho Chi Minh expressed deep regret for the ambiguous attitude adopted by France in the negotiations. Ho Chi Minh said that he would return to Vietnam soon, but the negotiations would continue. If the negotiations fail, the Vietnamese people will not cooperate with France, which is not in France's interest.

　　法越谈判无结果
    胡志明谴责法方态度含糊
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：越南共和国政府主席胡志明氏，五日发表谈话称：越南代表与法方代表已在封罗举行会议若干次，然迄无成就。越南目前主张越南为法兰西联合国内之自治单位，如不列颠联合国之自治领，然法国对越南此种最低限度的要求却不愿接受，越南主张交趾支那应包括越南政府之内，然法国则欲以交趾支那为越南联邦之一，其地位与越南政府相等。最后胡氏对法国在谈判中所采取的含糊态度深表遗憾，胡氏说：他即将返越，但谈判仍将继续进行。若谈判失败，越人将与法国不合作，这对法国不利。
