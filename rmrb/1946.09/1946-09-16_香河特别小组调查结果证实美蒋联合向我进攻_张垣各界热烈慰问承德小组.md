    Zhangjiakou Circles Warmly Console Chengde Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th] The Twenty-Fifth Special Group, in its adjusted investigation in the Xianghe area, has confirmed the following facts based on materials obtained: (1) The section of the Pingjin Highway from Hewu to Tongxian and the surrounding villages and towns of Daxiao Shahe, Anping, Matou, Wangjiabai, Yongledian, Xiji, Hongmiao, Xianghe, etc., were liberated areas before January 13th, and were indeed occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops successively from July 29th to August 4th. The conflicts that occurred in the Anping and Xianghe areas from July 29th to August 25th were all caused by Chiang Kai-shek's offensive actions. This move by Chiang Kai-shek's troops was the beginning of a full-scale offensive against Rehe and eastern Hebei. Furthermore, the group confirmed that US-Chiang Kai-shek forces were indeed jointly stationed in Anping after July 29th, and US troops only withdrew on August 4th. During this period, the US military provided rear guard duties for Chiang Kai-shek's troops, allowing Chiang Kai-shek's troops to maintain the forward positions they had seized for attacking Xianghe before the main force arrived in Anping. (2) Chiang Kai-shek's troops completed all preparations for attacking Xianghe during their occupation of Anping. On July 20th, the US military also dispatched two aircraft to help scout the Xianghe area, and then Chiang Kai-shek's troops launched a fierce attack, capturing Xianghe on the 5th. These are all clear evidence of a joint US-Chiang Kai-shek attack on the liberated areas.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 12th] The Chengde Group of the Military Mediation Department, forced to evacuate from Chengde due to the Chiang Kai-shek troops' offensive and then bombed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes en route, including Chiang Kai-shek's representative Yan Shiji, Communist representative Wang Xiaotian, US representative Mr. Rossman, and more than ten staff members, arrived in Zhangjiakou at 10:00 AM on the 11th after traveling through Longhua, Weichang, and Duolun for ten days. Upon hearing the news, Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, immediately dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff Zeng Yongquan and Deputy Director of the Political Department Cai Shufan to greet them outside the city and then proceeded to the Liberation Hotel for rest. Ke Qingxuan, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government, Yan Lixuan, a member of the Border Consultative Council, Yang Chunpu, Mayor of Zhangjiakou, and representatives of various groups in the Border Region also rushed to express their condolences. The group members had endured the suffering of war and trekking, but their spirits were high. Colonel Rossman, the US representative, delivered a speech on behalf of the group, expressing his gratitude for the condolences from all circles. At approximately 1:00 PM, a special plane from the Beiping Military Mediation Department arrived in Zhangjiakou, and all members of the group bid farewell to representatives from all circles of the Border Region before departing for Beiping.

　　香河特别小组调查结果
    证实美蒋联合向我进攻
    张垣各界热烈慰问承德小组
    【新华社北平十二日电】二十五特别小组分组在香河地区之调处调查中，根据已获材料，肯定了以下事实：（一）平津公路河西务至通县段及其附近的大小沙河、安平、马头、王家摆、永乐店、西集、红庙、香河等村镇，一月十三日以前即为解放区，确系七月二十九日至八月四日陆续为蒋军侵占。在安平、香河地区，由七月二十九日至八月二十五日所发生的冲突，均为蒋方进攻行为所造成，蒋军此举即系对热河与冀东的全面进攻的开始。又小组证实，自七月二十九日后，美蒋军确系联合驻守安平，八月四日美军始撤离。此期间美军为蒋军担任后方警戒，使蒋军在主力未到达安平前，保持已侵占的进攻香河的前进阵地。（二）蒋军侵安平期间，完成了进攻香河的一切准备工作。七月二十日，美军并派飞机两架，帮助侦察香河地区，旋蒋军即发动猛攻，于五日侵陷香河。这些均为蒋美联合进攻解放区的明证。
    【新华社张家口十二日电】在蒋军进攻下被迫撤离承德途中复遭蒋机轰炸之军调部承德小组蒋方代表阎时济、中共代表王笑天、美方代表罗士曼及随员一行十余人，辗转经隆化、围场、多伦，历时十天，于十一日上午十时抵张垣。晋察冀军区司令员聂荣臻闻讯，立派副参谋长曾涌泉、政治部副主任蔡树藩二氏至郊外迎迓，旋赴解放饭店休息。边府民政处长柯庆旋，边参会驻会议员阎力宣、张市市长杨春圃及边区各团体代表十余人，亦赶往慰问，小组人员难饱经战争与跋涉之苦，但精神甚佳，美代表罗士曼上校代表小组致词，对各界慰问表示谢忱。午后一时许，北平军调部专机抵张垣，该小组全体人员与边区各界代表始握别，离此飞平。
