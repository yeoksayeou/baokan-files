One Who Serves the People is Always Happy
    ——An Interview with Retired Soldier Comrade Ma Guilin

    Comrade Ma Guilin is a twenty-three-year-old youth who lost both legs during the Lin-Nan Campaign. Comrade Ma, originally from Mazhuang in the tenth district of Wu'an, returned from Yan'an this January after being discharged from the army and is now settled in Boyan.

    Recently, on a hot afternoon, I met him in a room under a former enemy blockhouse. At that time, he was sitting on the ground holding a book, talking and laughing as he recounted the stories in the book to a comrade who had just settled in. As soon as I entered, he quickly knelt up, asking me to sit on his bed. On the vermilion table between the two beds, there was a collection of ancient and modern novels, as well as ink, pens, and paper. On another table, there were flutes, whistles, and various toys such as automatic tanks and cars, as well as various exquisite colored photos and pictures. At the joints of his legs, he had two black rubber pads. He moved up and down thirty to fifty times a day, relying on these two rubber pads. His smiling face was often covered with long hair, and a wide leather belt was tied around his gray military uniform.

    Although I had seen him several times at struggle meetings, it was the first time I sat down and talked with him. I wanted to understand how he lost his lower limbs. Because I was afraid he would be saddened, I started by asking how his current life was, and what difficulties he faced at home... When I mentioned how he joined the army, he said sadly: "I joined the Wu'an Independent Battalion at the age of thirteen. At that time, my father worked as a hired laborer, my mother sewed and mended for others, and my younger siblings were young. I also herded cattle for others. Damn it! Shi Rupo and Zhao Yijin only gave me three yuan and five mao a year. How could we live like that? When the Eighth Route Army recruited soldiers, I said to my parents, 'Are we all just going to starve to death? I'm going to be a soldier to escape death. Living, at least one of us gets to live.' The old folks sent me off crying. They said: 'Go, it's good if one of us lives.'" At this point, his eyes filled with tears, and I was also moved and sat with my head down.

    "After being a little devil in the Wu'an Independent Battalion for about a year, I went to the Thirty-Second Regiment as a通讯员. During the Lin-Nan Campaign in January of that year, I went down to the company, and in July I won the prize." Because he was a victor in the Lin-Nan Campaign, he turned from a painful memory to a pleasant narrative:

    "When we attacked Lin County, the East and South gates were attacked by the ××× unit, the Shexian, Licheng, and Lucheng militia attacked the West gate, and our Thirty-Second Regiment, the First, Fifth, and Ninth companies, together with the Pingshun militia, attacked the North gate. At that time, a campaign to compete in capturing the city was launched to see who would be the first to break in. During the day, our heavy flat-trajectory mountain guns and anti-aircraft machine guns were aimed directly at the blockhouse on the North gate, and we began to take action at dusk. The anti-aircraft machine guns riddled the blockhouse with holes. Our artillery was really capable of blowing the roof off with one shot and destroying the base of the blockhouse with the second. We were so happy that we laughed and clapped, forgetting that we were at war, but felt that attacking the blockhouse was very fun. At this time, the engineers blew up the North gate. I was in the assault squad (ninth squad) of the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion. Seven of our veteran soldiers, holding hand grenades, and five new soldiers, carrying rifles, were the first to enter. We captured the Japanese "Headquarters", and the East and West gates then entered the city. At this time, it was only an hour or so after the start of the battle.

    "The enemy ran from the South gate, and we chased after them. Really, when you say 'fight the Japanese', you give it your all. However, not far from the South gate, enemy reinforcements came up, and a shell buried us in a pit. Two new soldiers who were crawling next to me were killed, and I fainted. The squad leader dug me out of the pit, and the Pingshun stretcher bearers, who were following closely, carried me to the outside of the West gate. When applying the medicine, I already knew that one foot was gone, and the other leg was connected by tendons. The regimental leaders, doctors, and comrades were afraid that I would be sad, and constantly comforted me to relax. After I went to the hospital, the leaders personally went to see me, gave me money to spend, and gave me good things to eat, but I thought, 'I lost my legs for the revolution, why bother with all this? Even if I die, it's still for fighting the Japanese.' So I never cried once after losing my legs." At this point, he picked up the flute and played "Little Cowherd."

    I asked him why he was so happy, and he said decisively, "People who serve the people are like this." He was about to continue when an old woman brought a pot of rice and placed it on the table, saying kindly, "Guilin, eat while it's hot, eat and then talk." At this time, I wondered, who is this old woman? Is she his mother? Why is she carrying a pot? Is she assigned to deliver food? No. So I asked Comrade Ma, and he said it was sent by the people of Sixth Street. While he was eating, I talked to the old woman.

    "Old lady, did the street assign you to deliver food today?" She was very unhappy to hear this, because Comrade Ma had been helping with work in the village all day for several days, and he was alone, so the newly emancipated neighbors automatically sent him some food. She said, "Assign? Who dares to assign!" When I asked further without changing my expression, the old woman softened her tone and said, "Because he has been busy in the village these past two days, and he's just one person, no one is making food for him, so the people on our street, this family sends a little, that family sends a little. Otherwise, who do you think he does it for? That's one thing; secondly, who do you think he was disabled for; thirdly, he is loyal and kind, because of this, don't even mention me sending food, there are many people sending food!" The old woman's words made me clearly realize one thing: the people have eyes, who serves them, they will serve whom.

    Before coming to Boyan, he lived in his original hometown. Thanks to the care of the villagers, no one in his family starved to death during several years of disaster. On the contrary, one person was added. Now his family has houses and land and has become a small middle peasant. He served as a children's corps instructor, farmers' association group leader, retired soldier group leader, and troop expansion group leader in the village. After coming here, he first joined the farmers' association and became involved in the struggle. Every struggle meeting I participated in, I saw him without fail. He said, "I have never offended anyone, old or young, but I am not polite to the landlords and not polite to mistakes. If I am polite, then I am wrong."

    As he spoke, he took out the things the masses had given him, saying, "Without the masses, there is nothing, and with the mass line, there is everything." He held up a delicate foreign pillow and said, "If you don't serve the masses, how can you be worthy of the masses!"

    Comrade Ma is currently the leader of the Boyan Retired Soldiers Group and yesterday he went to Yuquanling Village at the request of the masses to help with the work.

　　为民者常乐
    ——荣退军人马贵林同志访问记
    马贵林同志，是个二十三岁的青年，早在林南战役时，就失去了两脚。马同志原籍武安十区马庄，于本年正月由延安退伍归来，现安家伯延。
    日前，一个炎热的午时，在昔日敌人炮楼下的一间房中，我会见了他。那时他正坐在地下拿着一本书又说又笑的对着刚安家的一个同志讲述书中的故事，我一进去，他连忙跪起来，让我坐在他的床上。在两个床之间的朱红的桌子上，摆着一套套的今古小说和墨水钢笔纸张，在另一张桌上，置有笛子、口哨和自动坦克、汽车等各种玩具，还有各样精制彩色照片、画片，他腿的关节处绑有两个黑胶皮块，一天三十五十，上上下下，就凭着这两个胶皮块。他多笑的脸上，常常披有长发，在灰色的军衣上，扎着一根宽大的皮带。
    虽在斗争会上我曾几次的见过他，但坐在一块儿谈却是第一次。我想了解他是怎么失去下肢的，因怕他难过，我是从现在生活怎么样，家里生活有什么困难……谈起的。当我提到他是怎么参加部队的时候，他很悲痛的说：“十三岁我就参加了武安独立营。当时父亲作长工，母亲给人缝纫补洗，弟弟妹妹年幼，我还给人放牛，妈的！石汝坡赵一金一年才给我三元五毛钱，这叫我们怎么的生活下去呢，当时八路军招兵，我对爹娘说，咱们都活活的饿死吗？我去当兵，逃一个活命，老的们哭着送出了我，他们说：去吧，活了一个算一个。”这时他的泪水充满了眼眶，而我也被感动得垂首而坐。
    “在武安独立营当了年吧小鬼，就到三十二团当通讯员，林南战役那年正月，我下了连，七月便佳了彩。”因为他是林南战役的胜利者，他便由痛心的回忆转为愉快的叙述：
    “打林县时，东、南门由×××部攻，涉县、黎城、潞城民兵攻西门，我们三十二团一、五、九连与平顺民兵伙攻北门。当时开展了一个攻城比赛运动，看谁先打进去。白天我们的重平射山炮与高射机枪便对正了北门上的炮楼，黄昏便开始行动了。高射机枪把炮楼打的满身窟窿。我们的炮兵真能一炮揭了盖子，二炮端了炮楼底，我们高兴得又笑又拍手，忘记了那是在打仗，却觉得打炮楼非常好玩，就在这个时候，工兵炸塌了北门。我是三营九连的突击班（九班），我们七个老战士，拿着手榴弹，五个新战士端着步枪便首先进去了，我们打下了日本的“洪部”（司令部），东西门才进了城，这时离打仗不过个把钟头。
    “敌人由南门跑了，我们追着打，真的，一说打日本，就没命啦，可是，离南门不远，敌人援兵上来了，一个炮弹把咱埋到了坑里，和我在一块爬着的两个新兵牺牲了，我昏晕过去了。班长把我从坑里刨出，由紧跟着的平顺担架抬到西门外，上药时，我已经知道一个脚没有了，另一条腿是用筋连着的，团首长、医生和同志们怕我难过，一直安慰我把心放宽点，到医院后，首长们都亲自去看我，给我钱花，给我好吃的，但我心想，我为革命没了腿，何必来这一套呢？就是死了，还不是为打日本。所以我从没腿以后没哭过一次”。这时他拿起笛子吹起了小放牛。
    我问他为什么这样愉快，他斩钉截铁的说：“为人民的人，就是这样的”。他正要往下说，一个老婆婆端着一锅饭放在桌上，很亲切的说：“贵林，乘热吃吧，吃了再说”。这时我心想，这老婆婆是谁呢，是他母亲吗？为什么又端着锅？是派着吃饭吗？不会。于是我便问马同志，他说是六街老百姓送的，我乘着他用饭，便和这位老太婆谈起来。
    “老太太，今天街上派你送饭吗”？她听了后，很不高兴，因为数日来，马同志整天在村上帮助工作，而他又是一个人，所以新翻了身的邻家百舍便自动给他送些吃的，她说：“派，谁敢派”！当我毫不动声色的问下去时，那老太太才缓和了口气说：“因为他这两天在村上忙，一手人，没人给他做饭，我们街上的人就这家送一点，那家送一点，不然你说人家为谁，这是一；二来他为谁残废了的；三来他为人忠厚，因此个，不要说我送饭，送饭的人还多咧”！老太太的话，使我清楚的认识了一个问题，人民是最有眼睛的，谁为他，他就为谁。
    来伯延前，他住在他原来家乡。他的家由于村人的照顾，在几个灾年中没饿死一个，相反的还增加了一个人，现家里有房有地，成了一个小中农，他在村里当儿童团指导员、农会组长、荣退军人组长、扩兵组长等。来这里后，他首先加入了农会，卷入了斗争，凡我参与的斗争场合，没有一次不见到他。他说：“我老的小的都没惹过人，可是我对老财不客气，对错误不客气，我要是客气，那就是我的不对”。
    说着，他拿出群众赏给他的东西，他说：“离开群众啥也没有，走群众路线啥都有”。他提着一个精致的洋枕头说：“不为群众，怎么能对得起群众呢！”
    马同志现任伯延荣退军人组长，昨日已应玉泉岭群众之请，前赴该村帮助工作。
