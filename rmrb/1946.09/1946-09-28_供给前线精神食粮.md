　　Supplying newspapers and propaganda materials to the front lines during wartime can play a very important role in boosting morale and enhancing combat confidence. In the past, this matter has not received enough attention in general. It is said that a certain unit of our army repeatedly requested assurance of being able to see newspapers during combat before departing for the front lines, which shows the importance the troops attach to this issue. Now, the leadership of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area has effectively resolved this problem with great perseverance and determination, which is gratifying. However, here, we would also like to propose to the entire region: First, this issue has not been well resolved in some places. All relevant departments should recognize the importance of this issue with the spirit of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area in solving it, overcome subjective and objective difficulties, and earnestly solve it to ensure that newspapers and propaganda materials are quickly delivered to the front, and that combat troops can see them regularly. Second, the cultural circles should be urgently mobilized to serve the war. The soldiers and civilians at the front have displayed a high degree of heroism in defending the border areas and striving for peace, and have produced countless moving deeds and countless heroic figures. Cultural workers should seize the opportunity to go to the front lines to carry out the movement of writing about heroes and singing about heroes. These immortal deeds and respectable figures should be reflected in news reports and all forms of works to enrich the content of propaganda materials, front-line newspapers, and rear-area newspapers and magazines, to encourage the soldiers and civilians at the front to win greater victories. Newspapers and magazines published in the rear should attach importance to reflecting the war, quickly organize writing from the front, enrich the content, and strive for rapid publication, to serve the front and serve the war.

　　供给前线精神食粮
    战时输送报纸宣传品到前线，对于士气的鼓励，战斗信心的提高，能起非常重要的作用。这一件事，过去一般注意的不够，听说我军某部在出发前线之前，曾再三要求保证在作战中让部队看到报纸，足见部队对于这一问题的重视了。现在冀鲁豫区领导方面，以巨大的毅力和决心，对于这一问题作了有效的解决，这是值得欣喜的事。但在这里，我们还愿向全区提出：第一、这一问题，还有些地方解决的不好，各个有关部门应以冀鲁豫区解决这一问题的精神，认识这一问题的重要，克服主客观上的困难，认真把它解决，保证报纸宣传品迅速输送前方，并让作战部队能经常看到。第二、文化界应紧急动员起来为战争服务。前线军民为保卫边区争取和平发扬了高度的英雄主义，产生了无数可歌可泣的事迹与无数英雄人物，文化工作者应抓紧时机到前线去，开展写英雄唱英雄运动。把这些不朽的事迹，可敬的人物，用新闻通讯及一切形式的作品反映出来，充实宣传品、前线报纸以及后方报纸、杂志的内容，鼓励前方军民，争取更大胜利、在后方出版的报纸、杂志，应重视反映战争，迅速组织前方写稿，使内容充实，并争取出版迅速，为前线服务，为战争服务。
