　　The Struggle of Life
    Day was just breaking. The window paper rattled. The night air, thick like a fog, seemed to be blown away by a gust of cold morning wind, as a layer of milky white dim light crawled up the dilapidated window.
    Grandpa raised his head, opened his tired eyes, looked at the window, and then peered out through the window cracks at the puppet soldier walking back and forth in the yard.
    "Ah! The troops are coming, the troops are coming..."
    Grandpa was startled and shouted:
    "Hutou, Hutou, wake up! What? Hmm, this child is frightened again!"
    Hutou was nudged by Grandpa's elbow. He woke up.
    "Bastard! What are you yelling about early in the morning!" the puppet soldier cursed loudly outside.
    Grandpa quickly went to the window, put his hands on the window frame, and said:
    "Officer, look, this child is having a nightmare and is covered in sweat!"
    Hutou sat up. The wire binding his two hands together looked like a pair of handcuffs. It was still dripping blood.
    Grandpa looked at Hutou, said nothing, and turned his fiery eyes back to the window. His hands, like Hutou's, were also bound with wire. A surge of hot blood boiled within him. He gripped the window frame tightly, his arms trembling, and blood oozed from the wound. Several blurry fingerprints, red and dark, stained the paper on the window frame.
    What are you yelling? You almost caused trouble. Grandpa said quietly.
    "I had a good dream."
    "Keep your voice down, keep your voice down!" Grandpa's brown beard trembled, and he smiled at Hutou. "Oh, a good dream?"
    "I dreamed that our troops came, surrounding us from the eastern mountain, with machine gun fire suppressing the village. Our militia and workers' self-defense forces also came back to join the battle..."
    "Keep your voice down!"
    "I also dreamed that we all jumped on a boat!"
    Grandpa said with a smile:
    "Your dream is sure to come true! If our troops don't come today, they will definitely come in two or three days..."
    He curled up in the corner of the kang, and draped a tattered jacket next to him over Hutou.
    "Grandpa, they probably won't let us relax today!"
    "Remember, don't reveal a single truthful word! No matter what, don't listen to their lies."
    They were captured during a sudden enemy raid early the day before yesterday. At that time, most of the militia and workers' self-defense forces had gone to the county to participate in mobilization work. Some of the common people were just about to go to the fields to work, and some had not yet gotten out of bed. The enemy divided into two groups from the city and launched a retaliatory attack on Hama Valley. As soon as the militia fired, the common people began to evacuate. Hutou and Grandpa wanted to run to the riverbank to fortify the boat, but it was too late, so they hid. There were only the two of them at home; his mother had sacrificed herself during the anti-mopping-up campaign in May of this year. His father was the captain of the self-defense force and had also gone to the county a few days ago. The enemy searched the village and dragged Hutou and Grandpa out of their hiding kiln.
    The enemy established a temporary stronghold in Hama Valley, attempting to control the ferry and cut off the transportation line.
    There was sunlight outside the window. Hutou leaned against the window and looked at the distant mountains. Suddenly, the locked door opened with a creak. Hutou and Grandpa were startled and sat up. A Japanese soldier and a puppet army officer entered the room and drove them into the yard.
    The Japanese soldier held a pistol and a leather whip in his hands, his eyes glaring with a sinister smile.
    The puppet army officer deliberately smiled and said:
    "Folks, don't you really want to live? Why are you being so stubborn! Think about it carefully, what good is it to be stubborn in this place! Just tell the truth, and we'll let you go home to work. It's just a few words, we don't want anything else from you."
    Hutou and Grandpa didn't say anything. After a while, he continued:
    "I'm not lying to you, really. Tell me, where is the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army? How many militia and self-defense forces are there in your village? Tell me and we'll let you go. But don't be like yesterday, saying you don't know anything when we ask. If you do that again, we won't be polite!"
    When the enemy captured common people, they always tried to interrogate them for something, but the result often disappointed them, and it was not easy to get even a single truthful word. Now they were facing another obstacle in front of Hutou and Grandpa. Hutou just twisted his neck and refused to say anything. Grandpa sometimes pretended to smile at the enemy, sometimes sighed, and sometimes used a few harsh words to confront them. What could the enemy do? The only way was to kill them! But they didn't kill them immediately. So, they interrogated, insulted, scolded, lured, hung, and whipped them over and over again… Hutou and Grandpa were beaten unconscious. After a while, Hutou woke up and saw that he and Grandpa had already curled up on the kang. Grandpa suddenly seemed to have a nightmare, moaning a few times, and his legs violently twitched as if the enemy was still hanging him.
    "Grandpa, Grandpa!"
    Hutou called out. He seemed to hear the enemy's leather whip lashing Grandpa's head, face, and body again, and his heart felt a pang of pain. He watched Grandpa lying on the kang, his breathing suffocated, not moving at all. Blood had stained his hair, his face, and his brown beard, making them blurry.

    Grandpa wrapped his wounded head in a tattered blue undershirt. He sat on the edge of the kang, leaning against the wall, not feeling sleepy at all, but as if waiting for something, sometimes leaning on the window to listen to the outside, and sometimes lowering his head. Hutou sat beside him, his hands on his knees, his head buried deeply in front of his chest.
    Grandpa said softly:
    "See how it goes tonight? The enemy has been here for three days! Be alert when you sleep, and as soon as you hear our troops firing, you have to rush out no matter what…”
    “Maybe my dad will come back too.”
    “I don’t know what time it is now?”
    “It must be midnight!”
    “Well, be alert! Listen, why is someone making noise?" Grandpa's heart skipped a beat, and he sat up again.
    Hutou listened carefully and whispered:
    "No one is making noise! You're deaf. It's the Yellow River roaring."
    "Keep your voice down, keep your voice down! I'm afraid our boat is in trouble too!”
    “……”
    Grandpa was always thinking about his boat. He was a "veteran boatman" for many years, and his life's hope was placed on the Yellow River. Every time he jumped on his boat, he immediately felt a lot younger and full of energy, so he chatted and laughed with the other boatmen while he steered the boat. Boats flowed along the water, and when someone started singing there, he would join in. …However, an enemy mopping-up campaign destroyed this life. Several times his boat was damaged by enemy fire, but he always received help from the anti-Japanese democratic government and quickly restored his life on the river. He often took Hutou and the workers' self-defense forces to participate in the battle to defend the Yellow River. Once, before dawn, the enemy sneaked into Hama Valley again. As soon as the workers discovered the situation, they were afraid that the boat would be seized by the enemy. At this time, everyone did not have time to untie the cable. He gritted his teeth, raised a shiny axe, and cut the rope in a few strokes.
    "Quick, let the boat flow downstream!" he ordered.
    The workers scattered and jumped onto the boat. The boat flowed to the center of the river, and he took Hutou into the river, taking advantage of the rushing water to swim to the other side and report the situation to the river defense troops. Years of life on the boat had given him the skill of being familiar with water. Regardless of wind, rain, day, or night, he could swim across. He "treaded water" as if walking, with the upper half of his body gently floating on the water. …
    The river roared. He could hear it more and more clearly now. He had no sleepiness, just sitting and passing this lonely night.
    Suddenly, he heard someone call away the sentry in the yard, as if something tense had happened.
    There were Japanese soldiers cursing in the east courtyard. After a short pause, the puppet army officer mumbled:
    "Are you all blind? How are you guarding the gate! You wouldn't even know if you lost yourselves! No one came, how could the guns and coats disappear?"
    "I didn't see a single person!" someone replied.
    "Strange! You put the guns and coats on the kang…sleeping so soundly…”
    "Ugh, Eighth Route...Eighth Route Army there be..." The Japanese soldier was a little flustered.
    The puppet army officer asked again:
    "Did you guards discover anything unusual?"
    "Not a single sound."
    "Oh, now that you’ve done this, there aren't any sentries at the gate or in the yard. No, we have to hurry back… Go, first send someone to the street to tell everyone to step up their vigilance…"
    Someone ran out.
    "It's really strange! We'll search the patrol later! It's simply ghostly…What, the people who went to the other side of the river haven't returned yet?" The puppet army officer was obviously uneasy.
    Someone replied: "It's a long way to go around to the valley entrance to cross the river. I don't know if they can sneak in? I heard there are many Eighth Route Armymen there…”
    "Is the situation nearby reliable?"
    "Reliable…the common people say there’s nothing.”
    “Nothing? Everyone prepare to set off in plain clothes…to the other side of the river…ambush and activities…sneak across…grab a few people to pole the boat…”
    “Call those villagers to go?”
    “Pick a few honest people to go. Don’t call that old man, and you can’t trust his grandson either! You can’t get anything out of them…”
    “Then what do we do! There are only four or five young people, not enough people. That old man’s grandson, let’s call him to go anyway. It doesn’t matter, we have guns, what are we afraid of! Once we get across the river, we’ll just stab them with bayonets in the grassy mountains and gullies…!”
    “Oh, don’t let them hear, keep your voice down! You guys discuss it…”
    Hutou had been woken up by Grandpa long ago. They heard it very clearly. Grandpa was leaning on the window and whispered:
    "What, their guns and coats are gone, our people must have sneaked into the village and taken them!"
    Hutou was extremely happy. He said:
    "Unless they don't want me to go, if I go, I'm going to take down a few of them! Who’s afraid of them with a gun!"
    The yard was very quiet. But the enemy in the street were moving. The sentry had not returned yet. At this time, a figure appeared outside the window. The person touched the door, it was locked. Quickly moved closer to the window and listened. Then whispered:
    "Hutou, Hutou! Oh dear, you are here, you have made me so worried! Tell Grandpa, our people came in and went out again, the troops are coming soon…"
    Hutou was half surprised and half happy when he heard this.
    "Oh, Dad, how did you get in?"
    "I sneaked into the village and found the enemy's house. Tell you, I also grabbed a little 'foreign loot'! I looked for you in several places before I found you! As soon as the sentry left, I climbed down from the roof and listened to you talking."
    Grandpa turned his face to the window and asked:
    "Oh, 'foreign loot'? It must be the guns and coats, right?"
    "Didn't you hear them shouting about looking for them…I really couldn't help but laugh on the roof."
    "Hurry up and climb down off the roof. Don't let them find out. They're probably going to call Hutou to pole the boat…"
    "I heard everything up there."
    Hutou said:
    "They really want to die! If they want me to go, I'll go, what's there to be afraid of!"
    Grandpa was a little anxious and said:
    "Go, hurry up and go. Don't be reckless up there! Hutou will be responsible for the boat."
    "I brought three grenades. As soon as the fighting starts outside, I'll do it. I'll take out the sentry in the yard first…People are coming; people are coming…I'm leaving…"
    The footsteps of the sentry moved towards the yard. So, the figure outside the window flashed in the darkness, quietly went along the corner of the wall, and climbed onto the roof again.
    Sure enough, the enemy escorted Hutou and four other workers onto the boat.
    "Head to the lawn, quickly!"
    Hutou stood at the bow of the boat and said:
    "Hey! Officer, please help us. Untie the wires on our arms. Look, they're tied so tightly, how can we move! Are you still afraid we'll run away? The river is bottomlessly deep, even with wings, we can't fly out of here!”
    The enemy loosened their wires, and one person watched the rudder. Hutou and the other three poled the boat. The boat left the shore. The enemy, fearing that they would expose their target, told them to first let the boat drift downstream along the riverbank, and then turn towards the other shore after drifting a certain distance. A great change was about to come. Hutou carefully looked at the positions of the ten plainclothes spies on the boat, and his heart began to jump a little. He wanted to crash the boat into the shore rocks, but he was afraid that if the boat capsized so close to the shore, the enemy would climb back onto the shore! The boat slowly moved towards the center of the river. Hutou felt like he had walked into an open wilderness, with nothing to hinder his actions anymore. Could the enemy still push him into the river? Even if he was pushed in, so what! Every worker on the Yellow River knows how to swim, he was not afraid at all. But he was worried, he was afraid that if the enemy discovered his intentions, they would immediately shoot him. When the boat reached the center of the river, Hutou's heart suddenly lit up. He remembered that not far away, there was a reef protruding from the water. The surrounding water was very deep. He often took those eighteen- or nineteen-year-old young men who were his age to swim there, jumping from the reef with a bang and climbing back up from the reef's side. He felt like he saw a red lantern illuminating in front of him, and his eyes burned with fiery light. He secretly measured the river in his memory. The wind and waves were shaking the boat. It was swirling unsteady in the rushing current.
    "Hey, watch out! There are reefs here, the water is too rapid!" This was a warning signal. After Hutou finished speaking, the other workers understood. Hutou deliberately stamped on the boat board with his feet, secretly encouraging himself.
    The workers were very nervous. Someone said alertly:
    "Hey hey, we're here! Be careful, don't bump into it! Damn it, it's so dark tonight, you can't see anything, and the waves are so big!"
    "Keep your voice down!" the enemy stopped him.
    Hutou poled the boat. He had prepared everything. While watching the river, he kept looking at the guy sitting next to him who was holding a pistol. The reef finally appeared in front of him. He stomped his feet on the boat board three more times, and the rudder shook left and right for a while. The boat rushed forward in the waves, and several workers immediately used their poles to top the reef. The boat bumped and jumped a few times, and was knocked askew by a rapid current. Taking advantage of the panic of the guy next to him, Hutou reached out and snatched the pistol, then kicked him into the river. Then, Hutou dived into the water, and the other workers jumped into the river with a splash.
    The boat lost its master and kept spinning on the edge of the reef. Those plainclothes spies, whether they had forgotten or were cowardly, did not fire a single shot. Hutou and his comrades turned upwards from the water. They reached out and felt the boat was still on the edge of the reef. Two guys were climbing onto the reef, but Hutou felt their legs, and threw them into the river like dragging toads. He rushed towards the side of the boat again, picked up a pole, and laboriously hit the boat with a crackling sound. The workers fought with the boat, and the people on the boat struggled desperately. With a surging current, the boat rolled to another place.
    Just as Hutou had climbed onto the reef, he vaguely saw the boat sinking. But he was a little worried, so he and the workers chased after it.
    "Quick!"
    "Ride on the bow of the boat!"
    "Push, push…"
    The boat struggled, gasped, and spat out foam. Hutou was hidden in the darkness, hidden in the torrent. The boat, like a submerged beast, finally lost its last struggle and gradually sank…
    It was almost dawn. A burst of gunfire and grenades began to sound in Hama Valley.
    "Listen, our troops have entered the village…" Hutou climbed onto the reef.
    The workers cheered. Hutou took off the pistol strap from his neck, weighed it in his hand, stood on the high ground of the reef, and shouted towards the east bank of the river:
    "Oh—oh—eliminate those damn dogs, oh…"
    They jumped into the water again. Hutou floated up for a while, and then sank again. His head was always raised, swaying left and right on the water. One of his hands, holding a gun, moved very naturally in the waves. He was exhausted and floated towards the east bank of the river, following the rising and falling currents.
    On the slope outside the village, in the laughter of the crowd, a red flag was blown by the breeze, rising high and flying in the blue and clear morning sky.
    Hutou jumped onto the river bank, stood on the rock, and saw Grandpa at first sight, his head still wrapped in his own blue tattered undershirt. Hutou held the gun, swayed it, and shouted happily to the people: "Oh—oh—oh"
                  September, 1946.

### 生命的搏斗

　　生命的搏斗
    天刚放亮。窗户纸哗啦哗啦响。沉雾一般的夜气，像给一阵清冷的晨风吹散了似的，一层乳白色的暗光，爬上破落了的窗户。
    爷爷抬起头，睁了睁困倦的眼，瞧瞧窗户，又从窗缝往外瞧瞧那个在院子里走来走去的皇协军。
    “呵！队伍来了，队伍来了……”
    爷爷吓了一跳，叫：
    “虎头，虎头，醒醒！怎么？嗯，这孩子又吓住了！”
    虎头给爷爷用胳膊肘触动着。他醒了。
    “混蛋！一清早哇啦什么！”皇协军在外头大声骂。
    爷爷赶忙挨近了窗户，两手往窗棂一扶，说：
    “老总，你看，这孩子做梦，吓了一头汗！”
    虎头坐起来。捆在他两只手＠上的一根铁丝，牵连在一起，像一付手铐似的。还往下滴血。
    爷爷瞧瞧虎头，没说什么，又把那冒火的眼睛投向窗户。他的手＠像虎头一样，也捆着一根铁丝。一股热血在他周身沸腾。他两手抓紧了窗棂，胳膊受着震动，伤口的血，在向外冒。窗棂上的纸，红殷殷的沾了几个模糊的指印。
    你叫什么！差点惹出乱子来。爷爷悄悄说。
    “我做了一个好梦。”
    “小点声，小点声呀！”爷爷褐色的胡须一抖动，他朝虎头笑了。“怎么，是一个好梦？”
    我梦见咱们队伍来了，从东山包围上来，机枪火力直往村子压。咱们的民兵跟工人自卫军也回来参战了……”
    “小点声！”
    “我还梦见，咱们都跳到船上！”
    爷爷笑眯眯的说：
    “你这个梦准灵验！咱们的队伍今天不来，反正三两天一定会来……”
    他蜷伏在炕角上，把身旁一件破夹袄给虎头披在身上。
    “爷爷今天他们可又不会放松咱！”
    “记住、一句实在话也不许吐露！不管怎么，也不听他们的鬼话。”
    他们被捕，是在前天一清早敌人一次的突然奔袭。那时，民兵和工人自卫军，大部分都到县上参加动员工作去了。老百姓有的刚要上地干活，有的还没起炕。敌人从城里分两股向蛤蟆峪，采取报复性的袭击了。民兵一打枪，老百姓开始转移。虎头和爷爷，想跑到河岸把船坚壁起来，可是来不及，他们便隐蔽起来。家里只有他爷儿俩，母亲是在今年五月反扫荡时就牺牲了。父亲是自卫军队长，前几天也到县上去了。敌人一搜村，虎头和爷爷被他们从隐蔽窑里拖出来了。
    敌人在蛤蟆峪扎下了临时据点。企图控制渡口，割断交通线。  窗外有阳光。虎头靠着窗户望着远远的山。忽然，锁着的门，吭＠一声开了。虎头和爷爷惊动的都坐了起来。一个日本人带着一个皇协军的军官，走进屋来，把他们赶到院子去了。
    日本人手里握着一枝手枪，一根皮鞭，瞪着两只狞笑的眼。
    那个皇协军的军官，故意笑了笑，说：
    “老乡，你们真不想活吗？为什么要硬到底！再好好想想吧，在这地方硬下去有啥好处！还是实实在在说吧，说了就放你们，好回家干活。就是几句话，也不要你们别的。”
    虎头和爷爷没有做声。住了一会儿，他又说：
    “我不骗你们，是的，说吧，八路军指挥部在什么地方？你们村子民兵自卫军有多少？说了放你们。可不能再像昨天一样，一问三不知，要是再那样，一点也不客气！”
    敌人捉到老百姓，总想审问出一些什么，可是结果偏偏使他们失望，就是一句实在话，也不容易得到。现在他们在虎头和爷爷面前，又碰了钉子了。虎头只是扭着脖子不啃气。爷爷有时朝敌人装笑，有时叹气，有时硬声硬气的用几句话去顶敌人。敌人有什么办法？唯一的办法，就是弄死他们！但是又不立刻弄死他们。这样，就一次一次拷问，污辱，痛骂，诱骗，吊打，鞭抽……虎头和爷爷给弄得昏过去了。不一会儿，虎头苏醒过来，却看了看自己跟爷爷已经蜷伏到炕上。爷爷忽然仿佛做了一个噩梦，呻吟了几声，两条腿像给敌人在吊打时候那样，又剧烈的抖动了。
    “爷爷，爷爷”！
    虎头叫着。他好像又听见敌人的皮鞭，在爷爷的头上，脸上，身上乱抽，使他的心感到了一阵刺痛。他看着爷爷躺在炕上，呼吸窒息似的，一动也不动。血浸染了头发，一张脸，和褐色的胡须，也沾满了血，有些模糊不清。……
    爷爷把受伤的脑袋，包扎在一件蓝色的破汗褂里。他坐在炕头上，依靠着墙壁，一点儿也不感觉到困睡，却像在等待什么似的，一会儿伏到窗户上听听外边，一会儿又低下了头。虎头坐在他身旁，两手放在膝盖上，把头深深的埋藏在胸脯前头。
    爷爷小声说：
    “看今晚怎么样吧？敌人来已经三天了！睡觉惊醒点，一听见咱们队伍打枪，死活也得往外冲呵……”
    “大概我爹也准回来。”
    “现在不知道什么时候？”
    “半夜了吧！”
    “嗯，惊醒点呵！你听，怎么有人吵闹呢？”爷爷心一跳，又坐起来了。
    虎头仔细一听，悄悄说：
    “那有人吵闹！你耳背啦。是黄河水在哗哗响。”
    “小点声，小点声呀！咱们那只船恐怕也遭殃啦！”
    “………”
    爷爷总是惦记着他那只船。他是一个多年的“老艄工”，一生的希望，是寄托在黄河上。每天一跳上自己那只船，他仿佛立刻感觉到年轻了好多，劲头挺大，于是他一边撑着船，一边嘻嘻哈哈的和艄工又说又笑了。一只一只船在水上奔流。那儿一唱，他这儿也唱起来。……然而，敌人一扫荡，这生活就给破坏了。有好几次，他的船遭到了敌人炮火的毁坏，可是，他却一次一次得到抗日民主政府的帮助，很快就恢复河上的生活了。他常常带着虎头，和工人自卫军参加保卫黄河的战斗。有一次，天还没亮，敌人又偷袭到蛤蟆峪来了。工人一发现情况，怕船给敌人抢去，这时大家来不及解缆，他一咬牙，举起闪亮的斧头，几下就把绳索砍断了。
    “快，让船往下流！”他吩咐。
    工人们都分散开跳上了船。船流到河中心，他带着虎头往河里一跳，乘着奔腾的水流，泅到对岸，向河防部队报告情况去了。多年的船上生活，使他有着熟习水性的技能，不管刮风下雨，白天黑夜，使他都能游泳泅渡。他“踩水”，像走路一样，上半截身子，轻轻的浮动在水面上。……
    河水哗哗的响。他现在越听越清楚。他没有一点睡意，只是坐着，在度着这寂寞的深夜。
    忽然，他听见有人把院子里的哨兵叫走了，就像发生了什么事情那样紧张。
    东院有日本人的骂声。停了不一会儿，那个皇协军的军官这样嘟哝：
    “你们眼睛全瞎了吗？怎么站的门岗！连你们自己丢了也不会知道！没有人来，怎么枪和大衣会不见了？”
    “我就没见一个人影！”有人回答。
    “奇怪！你把枪和大衣放在炕上……睡得那样死……”
    “晤，八路八路的有……”日本人有点儿惊慌。
    那个皇协军的军官又问：
    “你们警戒都没发现什么情况吗？”
    “一点动静也没有。”
    “呵，你们这一来，门口院子现在都没哨，不行，得赶快回去……去，先去街上一个人，告诉大家加紧警戒……”
    一个人跑出去了。
    “真是奇怪！一会就搜巡！简直活见鬼……怎么，去河对岸的人，还没回来？”那个皇协军的军官，显然是不安了。
    有人回答：“绕到峪口过河，路很远。不知能不能混进去？听说那儿八路军很多……”
    “附近的情况可靠吗？”
    “可靠……老百姓说没什么。”
    “没什么？大家准备便衣就出发……河对岸，埋伏活动……偷渡……押几个人去撑船……”
    “叫那几个老乡去？”
    “挑几个老实的人去。那个老头不要他去，他的孙子也靠不住！什么也问不出来……”
    “那怎么办！年轻的人只有四五个，人不够，那个老头的孙子，还是叫他去吧，没关系，我们有枪怕什么！一送过河，在草坪山沟沟，就把他们用刺刀挑掉算了……！”
    “呵，别叫他们听见，小点声！你们商量办吧……”
    虎头早给爷爷叫醒了。他们听得很清楚。爷爷伏在窗户上，小声说：
    “怎么，他们的枪和大衣不见了，一定是咱们的人进村摸走了吧！”
    虎头高兴极了。他说：
    “除非他们不要我去，一去，我非搞掉他们几个不可！有枪谁怕他们！”
    院子很静。但是街上的敌人在活动了。哨兵还没有回来。这时有一个人影出现在窗户外头。那人摸了摸屋门，锁着了，很快又挨近了窗户，听了听便小声叫：
    “虎头，虎头！呵呀，你们在这，可把我急坏了！告诉爷爷，咱们的人进来又出去了，队伍就要来……”
    虎头一听，半惊半喜的说：
    “呵，爹吗，你怎么进来了？”
    “我摸进村，就摸到敌人屋里。告诉你们，我还摸着一点‘洋捞哩’！找了好几个地方才找到你们！哨兵一走，我从屋顶上爬下来听你们在讲话。
    爷爷把脸对着窗户，问：
    “呵，‘洋捞’？一定是枪跟大衣吧？”
    “你不听见他们在嚷着找……我在屋顶上真忍不住笑。”
    “快上屋顶爬下吧。可别叫他们发现呵。他们大概要叫虎头去撑船……”
    “我在上头什么都听见了。”
    虎头说：
    “他们真要找死！要我去就去，怕什么！”
    爷爷有点儿焦急，说：
    “走吧，快走吧。你在上头可不要冒失呀！船上的事，由虎头负责好了。”
    “我带了三颗手榴弹，外头一打枪，我就动手，先把院子哨兵给崩掉……来人；来人了……我走……”
    哨兵的脚步声，向院子这边移动。于是，窗外的人影，在黑暗中一闪，悄悄的沿着墙角，又爬上屋顶了。
    敌人果然把虎头和另外四个工人，一同押上了船。
    “开到草坪，快一点！”
    虎头往船头上一站，说：
    “哎！老总，帮帮忙吧。把胳膊上的铁丝绳子给解下来吧。你们看，捆得这样牢，怎么能动弹！还怕我们跑吗？河没底的深，就是长着翅膀，也飞不出去呵！”
    敌人把他们的铁丝绳子松开了，一个人看舵。虎头跟另外三个人撑船。船离开了岸，敌人怕暴露了目标，叫他们把船先从河边往下流，流到相当距离，再转湾儿朝对岸开。一个巨大的事变就要来了。虎头仔细看船上那十个便衣特务的位置，心可就开始有点儿跳。他想把船往岸石上撞，可是又怕船一翻，离岸这么近，敌人还不是要爬上了岸！船慢慢向河心移动了。虎头像走向了开阔的原野，再没有什么东西可以阻碍他的行动了。难道敌人还能把他推到河里？就是推下去，那怕什么！黄河上的工人那一个不会泅水，他一点也不怕。可是担心的，他倒怕敌人一发现他的企图，马上会给他一枪。船到河中心，虎头的心一下子闪亮了，他记起在不远的地方，有一块突出水面的礁石。周围水很深。他常常跟那些和他一般大的，十八九岁年轻小伙儿在那儿洗澡，从礁石上砰的一声跳下去，又从礁石旁边翻动着爬上来了。他就像看见一盏红灯笼，在他面前照耀，他的眼睛燃起了火焰似的光亮。他用记忆在里暗中测量着河。风浪在摇撼着船。它不稳的在奔流中打旋。
    “喂，留心哪！这儿有礁石，水太急噢！”这是一声警号。虎头说完，几个工人也就明白了。虎头故意用脚蹬打着船板，内心暗暗鼓舞起来了。
    工人们非常紧张。有人机警的说：
    “哎哎，到了！小心点，可别碰上！妈的，今晚黑得什么也看不见，浪又这么大！”
    “小点声讲话！”敌人制止。
    虎头撑着船。他一切都准备好了。他一边在注视着河，一边又不住的在瞅着坐在他旁边，那个手里头掂着一枝盒子的家伙。礁石终于出现在他面前。他把脚在船板上又咚咚的蹬打了三下，舵跟着左右乱摇了一阵。船在浪头里往前一冲，几个工人立刻把篙顶到礁石上，船碰得震跳了几下，就给一股激流打歪了。虎头趁身旁那个家伙一发慌，伸手夺过那枝盒子，便把他一脚踢到河里。于是，虎头往水里一钻，紧跟着那几个工人都扑通扑通的跳到河里去了。
    船失去了主宰，在礁石的边缘不住的打旋。那些便衣特务，不知是忘了，还是胆怯？一枪也没有放。虎头和自己的伙伴，从水里往上一翻，他们伸手摸了摸船还在礁石的边缘。有两个家伙正在往礁石上爬，可是虎头摸着了他们的腿，就像拖癞蛤蟆似的，把他们摔到河里。他又朝着船边冲去，摸起一根篙，很吃力的朝着船上啪啪的乱打了一阵。工人们和船搏斗，而船上的人在拼命挣扎。随着一股汹涌的激流，船往别的地方颠簸去了。
    当虎头刚爬到礁石上，他隐隐约约看见船在往下沉。但他有点不放心，又和工人们追去了。
    “快！”
    “骑到船头上！”
    “推呀，推呀……”
    船挣扎着，喘息着，吐着泡沫。虎头隐伏在黑暗里，隐伏在激流中。船像一只被淹没的野兽，终于失掉了它最后的挣扎力，渐渐的往下沉没……
    天快亮了。一阵枪声和手榴弹声，开始在蛤蟆峪响起来了。
    “听，咱们的队伍进了村了……”虎头爬上礁石。
    工人们欢起来。虎头从脖子上把那枝盒子的皮带卸下来，他掂在手里，站到礁石的高处，朝河东岸吆喝：
    “噢——噢——消灭那些狗日的噢……”
    他们又跳到水里。虎头一会儿浮上来，一会儿又沉下去。他的脑袋时时昂起，在水面上左右摇摆。他的一只握着枪的手，很自然的在波浪里划动。他逐着起伏的水流，疲惫不堪的在向河东岸浮泅。
    在村外的坡岭上，在人群的笑声中，一面红旗，被微风吹着，高高升起，飘扬在蓝色的清澈的晨空下。
    虎头跳上河岸，站在石岩上，第一眼发现了爷爷，他头上仍然包扎着自己那一件蓝色的破汗褂。虎头握着枪，摇摆着，那么高兴的朝人们大声喊了：“噢——噢——噢”
