Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 17th: A United Press report states that Schenke, a Nazi listed by the Chinese government for deportation and designated "to be punished," has filed a criminal defamation suit in a Chinese court against Randall, the head of United Press's China Bureau. The "reason" given is that Randall's reports "damaged his reputation." This matter has provoked fierce opposition from foreign journalists stationed in China. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China has sent telegrams of protest to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and Chinese Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang. The telegram to Byrnes, signed by 25 British and American journalists, requests that the State Department advise the Chinese government to oppose the lawsuit. The telegram to Wu urges him to "fully consider the serious implications of this case." According to these journalists, this case seriously infringes upon the freedom of journalists and threatens their safety and human rights. The telegram requests that "in accordance with Chinese trial procedures, the case be dismissed." The telegram continues: "Foreign correspondents stationed in China are astonished that an individual accused of anti-Allied crimes, and a national of a country with which China and its allies are still legally at war, is able to sue an Allied journalist in this situation." They are reportedly deeply perplexed and shocked that a Chinese court has accepted this case. The right of all foreign correspondents stationed in China to openly and freely report on the activities of enemy nationals in China has been threatened, and the safety and personal freedom of every foreign correspondent in China is in jeopardy, with press freedom severely undermined. The telegram to Byrnes points out that this is a serious infringement on press freedom, stating, "Pursuing this policy makes free and objective news gathering in China impossible."

　　留华纳粹分子有恃无恐
    竟然控告盟国记者
    【新华社延安十七日电】合众社报导：为中国政府规定驱逐出境且列名“应予处分”之纳粹分子申克氏，顷以刑事诽谤罪向中国法庭控诉合众社中国分社社长伦德尔氏。“理由”为伦氏所作之报导“破坏名誉”，此事引起驻华外籍记者的猛烈反对。驻华外国记者俱乐部已致电美国务卿贝纳斯及中国文官长吴鼎昌提出抗议。致贝纳斯之电文署名者为二十五名英美记者，其中要求国务院建议中国政府反对此起诉案。致吴氏电力促吴氏充分考虑此案之严重意义。”据这些记者之意见，此案实严重侵犯记者之自由，威胁他们的安全与人权。该电要求“按照中国审判程序，将该案取消。”该电文继称：“驻华外国记者不胜惊异被控以反同盟国之罪的个人以及中国及其盟国在法律上仍与之作战的国家侨民，竟然能够在这种情况下控告盟国记者。”据称，中国法庭竟受理此一案件，使他们深为困惑而震惊。一切驻华外国记者公开而自由报导敌国在华侨民活动情形的权利，已因而受到威胁，而每一驻华外国记者的安全与人身自由，也岌岌可危，新闻自由已受严重损害。致贝纳斯电中指出这是严重侵害新闻自由的行为，“奉行这一政策，就不能在中国自由而客观的采访消息。”
