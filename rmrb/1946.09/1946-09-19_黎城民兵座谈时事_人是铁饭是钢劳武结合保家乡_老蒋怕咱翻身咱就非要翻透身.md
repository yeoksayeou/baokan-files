　　Licheng Militia Hold Symposium on Current Events
    People are Iron, Food is Steel, Combine Labor and Military to Defend Our Homeland.
    Old Jiang Fears Our Emancipation, We Must Thoroughly Emancipate Ourselves!
    [This newspaper's Changzhi 16th dispatch] The entire Licheng county militia, divided by village, have been holding symposiums on current events, studying "Why is the current war a patriotic war? How to strive for victory in the war?" In the symposiums, everyone unanimously agreed: "Chiang Kai-shek is sending large armies to attack our liberated areas, wanting to sell China to foreigners (America). To defend the liberated areas, to protect ourselves from becoming subjugated people, this is a patriotic self-defense war." Moreover, everyone said, "To achieve victory, both production and military training must be done well." Some said, "People are iron, food is steel. With enough food, we can win battles; combining labor and military can defeat Old Jiang." "The more Old Jiang fears our emancipation, the more we must thoroughly emancipate ourselves." Finally, everyone recognized the importance of political rectification, eagerly saying: "Before, we thought there would be peace! We should relax and take a break! Who knew that Chiang Kai-shek and the foreign devils don't keep their word, colluding to attack us. We must properly rectify and train, recognize the current situation, and only by completely eliminating the reactionaries can we have peace." Everyone eagerly spoke and engaged in heated discussions.

　　黎城民兵座谈时事
    人是铁饭是钢劳武结合保家乡
    老蒋怕咱翻身咱就非要翻透身
    【本报长治十六日电】黎城全县民兵以村为单位分头座谈时事，研究“目前进行的战争为什么是爱国战争？如何争取战争的胜利？座谈中大家都一致认为：“蒋介石派大兵进攻咱解放区，要把中国卖给洋人（美国）。为了保卫解放区，保卫自己不当亡国奴，这就是爱国自卫战争。”而且每个人都说：“要胜利，生产练武都得弄好。”有人说：“人是铁，饭是钢，吃饱饭，能打胜仗；劳武结合就能打败老蒋。”“老蒋越怕咱翻身，咱就越要把身翻透。”最后大家都认识到政治整训的重要，都抢着说：“先前以为和平啦！总该松松气歇歇啦！谁知蒋介石和洋鬼子说话都不算话，勾搭起来进攻咱们。咱们可要好好整整训，认清时局，只有把反动派消灭净，才能有和平。”大家争先恐后的发言，展开热烈的讨论。
