Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Comprehensive reports indicate that due to the vehement opposition from Muslim League leaders and the riots by Muslims in Calcutta, the Indian National Congress Party has temporarily suspended its plan to form an interim government. On the 24th, Indian Governor-General Wavell announced that he would temporarily form an interim government under his leadership, comprising twelve members. Among them, the Congress Party would have seven representatives, non-Muslim League independent Muslims would have two, and there would be one representative each for Christians, Sikhs, and Parsis. In his broadcast on the 24th, Wavell also invited the Muslim League to send two representatives to participate in the interim government. He stated that if the Muslim League accepted participation in the interim government formed by the Congress Party, the ratio between the Muslim League and the Congress Party in the government could still be five to six (this proposal had been rejected by the Muslim League previously). In that case, the current interim government could resign. Muslim League leader Jinnah issued a statement on the 26th, reiterating that India should establish two separate states, one for Muslims and one for Hindus. He refused to participate in a government organized by the Congress Party, and said that Wavell's step to establish an Indian interim government was "the most ignorant, unstatesmanlike and dangerous." (Reuters) believes that it is a serious blow to the Muslim League and "Muslim India". As the political deadlock remained unresolved, the riots by Muslims in Calcutta continued for more than ten days. Although Wavell and Nehru arrived in Calcutta on the 25th to try to quell the riots, and the garrison in the city had been increased to 45,000, according to a United Press dispatch on the 26th, "Calcutta remains under martial law, the police will continue to search, and the number of Muslim rioters killed continues to increase." There were also reports of clashes in New Delhi and other parts of Bengal province, where Muslims are in the majority. United Press predicted: "Because the interim government organized by the Indian Governor-General does not have representatives from the Muslim League, new riots are almost inevitable."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: New Delhi News: Indian Governor-General Wavell announced the list of the Indian interim government on the 1st as follows: Prime Minister Wavell, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nehru (Chairman of the Congress Party), Defense Minister Matthai (Standing Committee member of the Congress Party, Director of a large Indian Christian company), Finance Minister Ali (non-Muslim League representative of the Hui ethnic group), Transportation Minister Prasad (Standing Committee member of the Congress Party), Minister of Agriculture and Food Ram (Congress Party member, representative of the Central Legislative Assembly), Minister of Labor Khan (non-Muslim League Muslim), Minister of Health, Education and Arts Ali Zaheer (Congress Party member), Minister of Legislation and Air Force Charlie (Standing Committee member of the Congress Party, former Premier of Madras Province), Minister of Industry and Supply Du×Si (Congress Party leader in the Indian Central Legislative Assembly), Minister of Electricity and Mining Fu Haber (Parsi industrialist, President of the Indian Central Bank), Minister of Commerce Singh (Sikh Punjab Province Construction Minister). Wavell originally invited the Muslim League to send representatives to participate, but this has been rejected.

　　印督组织临时政府
    国大占七席尼赫鲁任副总理
    回盟拒绝参加各地仍有暴动
    【新华社延安二日电】综合报导：由于回盟领袖的激烈反对和加尔各答回教徒的暴动，印国大党已暂缓实施组织临时政府计划。二十四日，印督魏菲尔宣布暂由他组织一受他本人领导的临时政府，包括十二人，其中国大党代表七人，非回盟的回教独立人士二人，基督教徒、锡克族及巴锡族代表各一人。魏菲尔在二十四日的广播中，邀请回盟亦选派代表二名参加临时政府。并称：倘若回盟接受参加国大党组织的临时政府，回盟与国大党在该政府中仍可按五与六之比（按此议曾被回盟拒绝过），如此则目前的临时政府即可辞职。回盟领袖金纳二十六日发表声明，重申印度应成立回教与印度教两个国家，拒绝参加国大党组织的政府，并谓魏菲尔所采取的成立印度临时政府的步骤，是“最无见识与无政治家的风度且带来危险性的”。（路透社）认为它是给予回教同盟与“回教印度”的严重打击。由于政治僵局未能打开。加尔各答回教徒的暴动十余日仍未停止，虽然魏菲尔与尼赫鲁二十五日抵加尔各答，图平息暴动，该城驻军亦已增至四万五千人。但据二十六日合众社电讯称：“加境仍在戒严中，警察将继续搜捕，暴动回民死亡人数继续增加。”新德里和回教徒占多数的孟加拉省其他地方，亦有冲突消息传出。合众社预料称：由于印督组织的临时政府未有回盟代表参加，新的骚乱几不可避免。
    【新华社延安三日电】新德里讯：印督魏菲尔一日公布印度临时政府的名单如下：总理魏菲尔、副总理兼外长尼赫鲁（国大党主席）、国防部长马太（国大常务委、印基督教徒大公司董事）、财政部长艾利（非回盟的回族代表）、交通部长普拉萨（国大党常务委员）、农业及粮食部长赖姆（国大党员、中央立法会议代表）、劳工部长克汗（非回盟的回教徒）、卫生教育及技艺部长阿里沙赫尔（国大党员）、立法部兼空军部长查理（国大党常委、前马德拉斯省总理）、工业部兼供应部长杜×斯（印中央立法会议国大党领袖）、电力及矿业部长甫哈巴（巴锡族实业家、印中央银行总裁）、商业部长辛恩（锡克族旁遮普省建设部长）。按魏菲尔原邀请回教同盟派代表参加，已遭拒绝。
