　　Ensure Land to the Tiller
　　Taiyue Reduces Property Deed Tax Rate
　　Mass Movement in Sixteen Counties of Southern Hebei Reaches Climax
　　[Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng on the 24th] The Taiyue Administrative Office convened a meeting of the heads of finance departments from various counties, which passed two proposals: reducing the property deed tax rate, and allowing farmers to deduct production start-up costs when calculating burdens on land obtained during the mass movement, in order to ensure land to the tiller and rapidly develop the large-scale production movement. The resolution stated: First, in order to ensure the property rights of land and houses obtained by farmers from landlords, traitors, local bullies, and usurers through liquidation struggles, they should pay deed taxes to the government. The tax rate for absolute deeds is reduced to 4%, and the tax rate for mortgage deeds is reduced to 2%. Before this tax rate is revised, farmers who have obtained land and houses in the mass movement and have not paid taxes on time due to economic difficulties may, with certification from the village peasants' association, pay taxes according to the revised tax rate. Second, in order to quickly support liberated farmers in production and prosperity, all land obtained through liquidation, from now on, can have production start-up costs (such as expenses for buying livestock and farm tools) deducted when calculating reasonable burdens. The deduction ratio can be determined by villagers' discussion based on specific circumstances.

　　冀南十六县群运走向高潮
    【本报阳城二十四日电】太岳行署召开的各县财政科长会议，通过减轻房地契税率，群运中农民获得土地计算负担应扣除生产铺垫费两项议案，以确保实现耕者有其田及迅速开展大生产运动。该决议案中称：第一、为确保农民从地主、汉奸、恶霸、高利贷者清算斗争中得到之田地房屋的产权，应向政府投纳契税，死契之税率减至百分之四，典契者之税率减至百分之二，在本税率未修订以前，农民在群运中获得之田地房屋，因经济困难而逾期未投税者，经村农会证明，可以按修订税率税契。第二、为迅速扶植翻身农民生产致富，凡属清算得到之土地，从现时起，计算合理负担时可以扣除生产铺垫费（如买牲口农具等费用），其扣除比例，可根据具体情况由村民评议决定。
