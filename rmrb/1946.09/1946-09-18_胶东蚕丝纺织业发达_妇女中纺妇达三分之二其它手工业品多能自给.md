Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 16th: Jiaodong's silkworm breeding, silk weaving, textile production, straw hat making, and cigarette production industries have achieved universal development. Silk is one of Jiaodong's famous special products. Weihaiwei, Wendeng, Rongcheng, Fushan, and Muping are all well-known silk-producing areas. Before the war, the output of silk was 60.8 million feet. During the war, the output decreased sharply due to the enemy's cruel exploitation, but now it has increased to 57.6 million feet. Before the war, there were about 260,000 silk workers and silkworm farmers. Under the puppet regime, only 40,000 remained, but now the number has increased to 100,000. The number of silk weaving and reeling factories has also increased from only a dozen during the war to more than 200, and 42 silk reeling cooperatives have been organized. In addition to providing loans for silkworm seeds, the government has also established eight special silkworm improvement farms and 27 silkworm breeding base villages. Twenty silkworm farmer training courses have been opened, training more than 100 cadres and providing silkworm farmers with scientific knowledge to improve silkworm breeding and pest control. According to incomplete statistics, the textile industry currently has 1,481,487 spinning machines and 50,593 looms. This kind of handicraft industry is now widely distributed in the vast rural areas of Jiaodong. According to statistics from five counties, Wendeng, Rongcheng, Fushan, and Haiyang, 50 to 70 percent of women are engaged in textile production, and more than 145,000 people have joined textile groups. As for bank textile loans, the amount last year alone was more than 10 million yuan. The output of vermicelli is the highest in Zhaoyuan, Muping, Rongcheng, Huangxian, and Yexian, with Zhaoyuan being the most famous. According to statistics from 32 villages in the Fifth District, there were more than 70 vermicelli-making groups before the war. All of them stopped during the war. In the first half of this year, the government provided loans of 572,700 yuan, and farmers organized 42 vermicelli-making groups, grinding 162,640 catties of soybeans, resulting in a large increase in output. Yexian's straw braid is a famous special product nationwide, with an annual output of about 10 million bundles, 90 percent of which are sold well in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Calculated at 10 yuan per bundle, the total income reaches 100 million yuan. In the Xiyang Village, Xinzhuang, and Zhenzhuzhuang areas of Yexian, there are more than 30 straw braid workshops, exporting 100 to 150 boxes every five days, worth 2 million yuan in local currency (20 yuan per legal tender). The number of people engaged in straw braid making is more than 100,000, and women participate widely. According to statistics from Xinzhuang Village, the proportion of women participating reaches 60 percent. The government also provides support in many ways. For example, in Shahe alone, the straw braid loan this spring was 870,000 yuan. Other various handicraft industries, such as cigarettes in Yexian, Huangxian, and Penglai, and soap in Huangxian and other places, can meet the needs of all the people in Jiaodong.
