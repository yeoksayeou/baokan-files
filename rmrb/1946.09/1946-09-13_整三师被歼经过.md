Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporter's Eyewitness Account

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Heze, September 9th] Our frontline reporter, Ding Man, reports on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, the reorganized 3rd Division, which had been used to suppress the Communists for many years: After our counter-attacking forces tightened the encirclement, the general counter-attack began on the night of the 5th. Under the probing and flashing lights and flares of the Chiang army, our brave warriors advanced swiftly and nimbly under cover, with stretcher teams closely following. The militiamen were busily coming and going, undertaking communication and liaison work. A militiaman from Xuanji, Qibin County, said as he walked, "We must encircle Chiang Kai-shek's troops well, not let a single one escape, to save us from being attacked in our liberated areas again." The soldiers and cadres loudly proclaimed: "We will not leave the front line until we eliminate the invading army!" "Let's emulate the seven great victories in Central Jiangsu!" At half past twelve, the first signal streaked across the sky, and our big and small cannons and light and heavy machine guns roared at the surrounded Chiang army. Then the second signal was sent out, and the brave warriors rushed like whirlwinds from the east, northeast, and southwest of the village into Dayang Lake, through the deer stockades, and into the pillboxes. Platoon Leader Wang Zihe and his platoon occupied a certain military stronghold. The Chiang army launched four counterattacks against them. Although only four people remained in the end, they all shouted in unison: "Even if we all die, we will not give the fortifications to the enemy!" Finally, under the hand grenades of the four warriors, the invading army suffered heavy casualties and retreated in defeat. Chiang Kai-shek's 3rd Division Commander Zhao Xitian, seeing that the situation was not good, hurriedly sent two guard companies and two tanks to support his main regiment, the 59th Regiment of the 20th Brigade, but it was useless. The tanks were driven back, and more than 300 guards were captured on the retreat. On the morning of the 6th, five American-made heavy bombers, one Flying Fortress, flew over Dayang Lake and indiscriminately bombed, but it was too late. Ten minutes earlier, Deputy Commander Wu Sidong (the regimental commander had already been sacrificed in vain) and more than 2,000 officers and soldiers of the 59th Regiment had all laid down their weapons, and the glittering American weapons lay snugly in the arms of the people's soldiers! Chiang's army's Deputy Commander Wu Sidong exclaimed: "The 3rd Division has been disarmed; you are invincible! You are invincible!"

　　整三师被歼经过
    新华社前线记者目击记
    【新华社荷泽九日电】本社前线记者丁曼报导蒋介石嫡系剿共多年的整编第三师被歼经过称：我反击部队加紧了包围圈之后，五日黑夜开始了总反击。在蒋军探照灯和照明弹探射闪耀下，我们的勇士们迅速敏捷地荫蔽着前进，担架队紧跟上来了，民兵紧张地来往，担任着通信联络工作。齐滨县轩集一个民兵边走边说：“要把蒋介石兵包围好，不叫他跑掉一个，省得再来打咱解放区。”战士和干部们响亮的提出：“消灭不了进犯军不下火线”，“向苏中七次大捷看齐”！十二时半，第一个信号掠过天空，我们的大小炮和轻重机枪齐向被围蒋军咆哮；接着第二次信号发出来了，勇士们像旋风一样从村东、东北、西南冲进大杨湖，穿过了鹿寨，冲进了暗堡。排长王子和跟他一排人占领某军事要点后，蒋军向他们发动四次反扑，最后虽仅剩四个人，他们都同声喊着：“死光了也不能把工事让给敌人”，终于在四勇士的手榴弹下，进犯军遭到重大杀伤溃退了。蒋军第三师师长赵锡田看着不妙，急忙把两个警卫连和两辆坦克车来支援他的主力团——廿旅五十九团，但也无用，坦克车被打退了，三百多警卫兵在退却路中被俘了。六日早晨，蒋介石五架美制重型轰炸机一架空中堡垒，飞到大杨湖上空滥施轰击，但已经迟了，在十分钟前，五十九团副团长吴丝东（团长已遭无谓牺牲）以下二千余官兵，已全部放下了武器，闪光夺目的美式武器伏伏贴贴的躺在子弟兵的怀抱！蒋军的副团长吴丝东赞叹地说：“第三师被解除武装，你们是无敌了！你们是无敌了！！”
