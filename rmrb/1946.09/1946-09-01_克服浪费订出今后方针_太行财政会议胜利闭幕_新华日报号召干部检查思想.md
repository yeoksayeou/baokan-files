　　【This dispatch from our Changzhi bureau on the 27th】The Taihang Administrative Office convened a financial conference that lasted for half a month, concluding on the 22nd. The conference held detailed discussions on the financial work of the region. In the past six months, there have been many new innovations in the region's finances, such as collective farming of public land, with the harvest going to the public; organizing labor for transportation during the agricultural off-season to solve expenditures; dismantling and selling dilapidated temples with the consent of the masses to build schools; and investing deposits in production cooperatives. These measures have directly enriched the local treasury. However, there are also serious shortcomings, such as chaotic phenomena like arbitrary apportionment, indiscriminate spending, and waste. Based on this situation, the future financial policy was studied, which is long-term accumulation of strength, combined with mass production, to broadly open up tax sources, enrich local finances, practice strict economy, reduce the burden on the people, and support the self-defense war. Regarding industry and commerce, it is necessary to balance the industrial burden, and new coal mines will not bear the burden within one year. It has been decided at the meeting to conduct a major financial inspection in September, mainly to enlighten ideological consciousness through inspecting thought, and overcome the ideas of prioritizing private interests over public interests, and forgetting the public for private interests. The following decisions were made regarding future financial expenditures and corvée labor: 1. Village education expenses and village expenses shall be统筹統支 (unified planning and unified expenditure) by the village, with the source partly solved by public property, and partly solved by organizing labor transportation during the agricultural off-season. 2. County expenditures are partly solved by various taxes and partly solved by public property, to achieve the basic policy of village funds raised by the village and county funds raised by the county. 3. Strictly implement auditing, accounting, and reimbursement systems. 4. The problem of corvée labor is to expand the surface area of those available to be called upon, save temporary small corvée labor, establish a corvée system based on the experience of Licheng and Zuoquan, and calculate corvée based on labor and burden of output. This financial conference will put the region's financial work on the right track.

　　克服浪费订出今后方针
    太行财政会议胜利闭幕
    新华日报号召干部检查思想
    【本报长治廿七日讯】太行行署召开之财政会议历时半月，已于二十二日闭幕。会议上对本区财政工作作了详尽讨论，半年来本区财政上有许多新创造，如集体种公地，收获归公，利用农闲，组织劳力运输，解决开支。通过群众同意，拆卖破庙修建学校，将存款投入合作社生产等，这些都直接充裕了地方金库。但另一方面也还存在着严重缺点，如乱派乱支浪费等混乱现象。根据这种情形研究了今后的财政方针，是长期的积蓄力量，与群众生产结合，广泛开辟税源，充裕地方财政，厉行节约，减轻人民负担，支援自卫战争。对工商业要平衡工业负担，新开煤矿一年以内不负担。会上已决定九月份进行财政大检查，主要是通过检查思想，启发思想自觉，克服先私后公，私而忘公的思想。对今后财政开支与差务特作了如下决定：一、村教育费及村经费由村统筹统支，来源一部由公产解决，一部则利用农闲，组织劳力运输解决之。二、县开支是由各种税收解决一部，公产解决一部，做到村款村筹、县款县筹的基本方针。三、严格审计、会计、报销制度。四、差务问题根据黎城、左权经验是扩大支差面，节省临时小差，建立支差制度，支差按劳力与负担产量计分出差。这次财政会议将使本区财政工作走上正规。
