[Report from our correspondent in Weixian on the 11th] Under the leadership of the democratic government's rent reduction and production policies, and labor heroes Ye Wenzhang, and textile heroes Lian Zi Niang and Luan Cheng Niang, Wu Guanying, in the first district of Jize, has seen its various productions exceed those of previous years. The entire village's men till the land and women weave, achieving ample food and clothing. The village originally had 284 households with 1,106 people, and 7,186 mu of land, averaging 6.5 mu per person. One would think everyone should have a warm and well-fed life, but under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang and the puppet regime, the village often suffered from floods, and nearly 1,000 mu of land were barren. According to a man in his seventies, before the War of Resistance Against Japan and when the enemy was around, beggars, bandits, and opium addicts were everywhere. Since Jize was liberated, the democratic government has vigorously supported production by digging rivers, repairing canals, organizing women's spinning, developing the salt industry, and establishing cooperatives. After more than a year of effort, the village has been completely renewed, and all levels have joined the production upsurge and achieved remarkable results.

In agriculture, due to the strength of organization, not a single mu of the more than 71 hectares of land was left uncultivated, saving a large amount of labor for engaging in sideline production and undertaking the obligations of caring for 70 families of war veterans. Mutual aid has produced the "Old Hero"—Ye Wenzhang, the first in the county to be admired by the people. In the salt industry, salt troughs, which were previously considered illegal by the Kuomintang, have now become a major source of income for the village. There are now 19 salt ponds and five large pots, and in the three months of May, June, and July alone, 20,000 jin of salt have been boiled, totaling 50,000 jin with the previous stock. At 50 yuan per jin, this is equivalent to 2.5 million yuan, which can be exchanged for 500 shi of rice, enough for 172 people to eat for a year. According to the salt workers, half a month of salt processing is enough to sustain a person's life for a year. The village's livestock has also increased from 11 oxen to 34, and from two donkeys to four.

In the women's textile industry, there are now 27 spinning groups, with 190 spinning women, 176 spinning wheels, and 40 looms. From January to the present, a total of 997 bolts of cloth have been woven and sold (each weighing 3.5 jin and being 3 zhang long), and 142 bolts have been woven for self-consumption, totaling 1,039 bolts. Assuming a minimum profit of 3 jin of pure cotton per bolt of cloth, a total of 3,159 jin of pure cotton is earned, which can be woven into 3,159 jin of cloth, enough for all 1,106 people in the village to wear clothes (averaging 3 zhang of cloth per person per year). According to the spinning women, women can achieve economic independence by relying solely on spinning and weaving. Many women have bought a lot of land by spinning and weaving.

In terms of canal and river management, 2,700 workers were mobilized to dig through the Xinglong Ditch in the north of the village and the Wenming Ditch in the south. The entire village, men and women, were mobilized to dig an irrigation ditch three li long, eight chi wide, and five chi deep in the east of the village. Thus, Wu Guanying was freed from the terrible floods, and two-thirds of the dry land was turned into paddy fields. Old Hero Ye Wenzhang once confidently said: "Next year, all the dry land will be turned into paddy fields, and within three years, the barren land will also be turned into fertile fields."

In cooperative affairs, there is a cooperative with 452 members, with a grocery store and a steamed bun shop, with a capital of 92,120 yuan. In two months of operation, it has already earned a huge profit of 120,000 yuan, solving the difficulty of not being able to go to the market during the busy farming season. Now, there is not a single impoverished person or an idle person in the entire village of Wu Guanying. The entire village's men till the land and women weave, living a happy and prosperous life with ample food and clothing.

　　鸡泽吴官营各种生产超过往年
    男耕女织足衣足食
    英雄叶文章莲子娘领导得方
    【本报威县十一日电】鸡泽一区吴官营在民主政府减租生产政策及劳动英雄叶文章，纺织英雄莲子娘、銮成娘领导下，各种生产均已超过往年，全村男耕女织，作到丰衣足食。该村原有二八四户，一一○六人，土地七一八六亩，每人平均六亩半。按说每人都该有衣暖食足的生活，但在国民党及敌伪血腥统治时，该村常遭水灾，不毛之地，将近一千亩。据一位七十多岁的老者谈，抗战以前，和敌人在时，乞丐土匪和烟鬼到处皆是。自从鸡泽解放后，民主政府极力扶植生产，挖河、修渠，组织妇纺，发展盐业，与办合作社等。经过年余的努力，该村焕然一新，各阶层都投入生产热潮，且获得惊人成绩。
    在农业上，由于组织的力量，七十一顷多地，竟做到没荒一亩，已节省出大批劳动力从事副业生产，和担负着七十家抗属代的义务。互助中出现了为人所敬仰的全县第一名“老英雄”—叶文章。在盐业上过去被国民党定为犯法的盐槽，现在成为该村生产的极大收入。现已有十九个盐池，五口大锅，仅五、六、七三个月已熬出二万斤盐，连前存共五万斤。如以五十元计，共合洋二百五十万元，可换五百石米，足够一七二个人吃一年。据盐民谈，一个人淋盐半月足够维持一年的生活。该村牲畜亦由耕牛十一头增至三十四头，驴两条增至四条。
    妇女纺织业，现有纺织组二十七个，纺妇一九○人，纺车一七六辆，织布机四○架，从一月到现在共织卖布九九七个（每个重三斤半，长三丈），自穿布一四二个，合计一○三九个。以每个布最低赚三斤净棉计，共赚三一五九斤净棉，能织三一五九斤布，足够全村一一○六人穿衣（每人每年平均用布三丈计）。据纺妇们称：单靠纺织，妇女们即可达到经济独立。许多妇女靠纺织买了不少地。
    在修渠治河上，前后动员二七○○个工，挖通了村北。兴隆沟；村南的文明沟；且动员了全村男女在村东挖了一条长达三里，宽八尺，深五尺的浇地沟。至此吴官营免除了可怕的水灾，且使三分之二的旱田变成水田。老英雄叶文章曾有把握的说：“明年全部旱地要变成水田，不出三年，荒芜不毛之地，也将变成良田。”
    在合作事业上，有一个包括四五二个社员的合作社，下设杂货铺和馒头铺各一个，资本九二一二○元，两月的经营，已获得十二万元的巨利，解决了农忙时不能赶集的困难。现在的吴官营全村没有一个赤贫，没有一个闲人，全村男耕女织过着丰衣足食的愉快幸福的生活。
