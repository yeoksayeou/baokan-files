　　South America, Australia
    Oppose American Expansion and Aggression
    Demand US Troops Withdraw from Leased Bases
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Moscow dispatch: Labor newspaper commentator Gridev wrote: The people of South America resolutely demand the withdrawal of American troops, the withdrawal of bases temporarily lent to the United States, and the elimination of the dominance of American capital in the national economies of South American countries. The author concludes: American reactionary monopoly groups attempt to establish a US-led military-political bloc to dominate South America, turn the Western Hemisphere into their strategic base, and use the political power of this bloc to engage in their external activities. This military bloc, aimed at opposing the democracy and sovereignty of South American republics, is completely incompatible with the UN Charter and the establishment of lasting peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 7th: Sydney dispatch: Two responsible officials in Australia opposed the US monopoly of Manus Island (northeast of New Guinea) in the naval archipelago in the Southwest Pacific on the 5th. Australian Prime Minister Chifley said: "Australia wants to keep Manus Island. If the United States allows Australia to use the equipment in US territory, then Australia will allow the United States to use the equipment on Manus Island." The United States spent 200 million yuan to build a naval base on Manus Island during the war, and recently the United States attempted to seize it for itself.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: According to a report by the New York Herald Tribune reporter cited by TASS: The United States is stepping up the construction of new naval and land bases on the Philippine Islands. Negotiations between the South Philippine government on this matter have been completed. The reporter said: Although the Soviet Union proposed that all United Nations should report to the Security Council on the strength of their military forces stationed in non-enemy countries, US Army officials still stated that the location and size of US bases in the Philippines would be kept strictly secret. The United States ostensibly granted the Philippines independence on July 4th of this year, but in reality, it has strengthened its control over the country in all aspects, and building more bases is one of the methods.

　　南美、澳洲
    反对美国扩展侵略
    要求美军撤离租借基地
    【新华社延安八日电】莫斯科讯：劳动报观察家格里德夫撰文称：南美人民坚决要求撤退美国军队，撤退暂时借给美国的基地，以及肃清美国资本在南美国家国民经济中的统治地位。作者结语称：美国反动的垄断集团企图建立美国领导之下的美军事政治集团，借以统治南美洲，把西半球变成他们的战略基地，并利用这一集团的政治力量去从事他们对外的活动。这种旨在反对南美各共和国民主与主权的军事集团，是与联合国宪章及建立持久和平完全不相容的。
    【新华社延安七日电】悉尼讯：澳洲的两位负责官员，于五日先后反对美国独占西南太平洋上的海军群岛中的曼纳斯岛（在新几内亚东北），澳洲总理齐佛莱称：“澳洲要保管曼纳斯岛，如果美国可以让澳洲使用美国领土内的设备，则澳洲才让美国使用曼纳斯岛上设备。”曼纳斯岛上美在战争中费了二亿元建立一海军基地，最近美国企图把它据为己有。
    【新华社延安八日电】据塔斯社引美纽约先驱论坛报记者的报导说：美国正加紧在菲岛筹筑新的海陆军基地，关于此事南菲政府进行谈判已告完成。该记者称：尽管苏联提议各联合国应向安理会报告驻于非敌国的军力情况，美陆军部官员仍表示菲境美国基地的方位与大小将严守秘密。按美国于今年七月四日表面上给菲岛独立，实则加强对该国各方面的控制，增筑基地便是其中办法之一。
