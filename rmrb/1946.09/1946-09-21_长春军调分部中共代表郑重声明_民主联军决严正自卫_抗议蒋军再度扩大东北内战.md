　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th. In response to the Kuomintang army's renewed provocation of a large-scale civil war in the Northeast, Wu Xiuquan, Major General and representative of the Chinese Communist Party in the Changchun Executive Division of the Military Mediation Department, lodged a protest with the Chiang and U.S. representatives some time ago, as follows: On September 9th, the Kuomintang government's official newspaper, the Central Daily News, openly announced the news that "the National Army has advanced towards Harbin, and the advance troops have reached Taolai Zhao." This is tantamount to openly tearing up the Northeast Truce Agreement completely. The representative expresses serious protest against the Kuomintang army's perfidious actions. Regarding a series of actions by the Kuomintang army to undermine the Truce Agreement, the representative has repeatedly listed the facts and requested the division to pay serious attention and take effective action. When the 53rd Army landed in Huludao in late July, the situation in the Northeast became tense, and the representative submitted Memorandum No. 15, suggesting attention and restraint. In August, the Kuomintang army's movements became even more frequent, with the air force intruding into the airspace of the Communist-controlled areas everywhere for reconnaissance and strafing. The Kuomintang's 87th Division and 6th Division even violated orders and occupied Kangping on August 25th, and the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army began attacking Ximucheng on August 29th. The representative again submitted Memorandum No. 53, pointing out to the division the seriousness of the current situation in the Northeast. Finally, General Du Yuming violated his verbal promise to Mr. Li Minran in the Shenyang talks, rushed to repair the Songhua River Bridge, and began a large-scale attack on Harbin. Due to the above-mentioned series of actions by the Kuomintang to tear up the Truce Agreement, the Changchun Division was unable to exercise its functions and ensure the implementation of the "June 7th" Truce Order. Therefore, the representative hereby solemnly declares that the Kuomintang government and General Du Yuming shall bear full responsibility for tearing up the Northeast Truce Order, undermining the mediation work, and violating faith and promises. If the Kuomintang army does not retreat to its original defense and continues to attack rashly, our Northeast Democratic Allied Army will resolutely resist in self-defense.

　　长春军调分部中共代表郑重声明
    民主联军决严正自卫         
    抗议蒋军再度扩大东北内战
    【新华社哈尔滨十八日电】为国民党军再度挑起东北大规模内战事，军调部长春执行分部中共代表伍修权少将特于日前向蒋美两方代表提出抗议如下：九月九日国民党政府机关报中央日报竟然宣布“国军已向哈尔滨前进，先头部队已抵陶赖昭”之消息，此无异公开将东北停战协定撕毁无遗，本代表对国民党军此种背信弃义之行动表示严重抗议。查国民党军一系列破坏停战协定之行动，本代表曾数度列举事实提请分部严重注意并要求采取有效行动。当七月下旬五十三军在葫芦岛登陆，东北形势顿趋紧张，本代表即有参字第十五号备忘录提请注意制止。八月国民党军队调动更为频繁，空军到处侵入中共地区上空侦察扫射，国民党之八十七师及第六师更于八月二十五日违令侵占康平，新六军二十二师于八月二十九日开始进攻析木城，本代表又以参字第五十三号备忘录向分部指明当前东北形势之严重，最后杜聿明将军更违背与李敏然先生在沈阳会谈之口头诺言，抢修松花江桥，开始向哈尔滨大举进攻。由于上述国民党一系列撕毁停战协定之行动，致使长春分部不能行使其职权，保证“六七”停战令之执行。为此，本代表兹特郑重声明，撕毁东北停战令破坏调处工作及违背信义诺言之行为，应由国民党政府与杜聿明将军负完全责任。若国民党军不退返原防，仍冒然继续进攻，我东北民主联军将实行坚决之自卫抵抗。
