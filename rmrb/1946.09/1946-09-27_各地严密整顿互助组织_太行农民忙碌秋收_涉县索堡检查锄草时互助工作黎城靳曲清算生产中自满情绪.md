　　Various Places Strictly Rectify Mutual Aid Organizations
　　Taihang Peasants Busy with Autumn Harvest
　　Suobao in Shexian Inspects Weeding and Mutual Aid Work, Jinqu in Licheng Liquidates Complacency in Production
[Our newspaper's report on the 23rd] Peasants in various parts of Taihang are strictly rectifying mutual aid organizations and entering a period of intense autumn harvesting. In the first district of Pingshun, the fifth district of Huguan, the eleventh district of Linxian, and the seventh district of Wu'an, 75% to 90% of the male and female labor force have formed various types of mutual aid groups and are投入 involved in the autumn harvest campaign. Prior to this, leaders in various places had focused on reviewing the shortcomings that existed in mutual aid in the past. When Suobao North Street in Shexian inspected why eight of the fifteen mutual aid groups collapsed during weeding, it was discovered that the leadership had been lax in the past, there was no plan, mutual aid accounts were not settled in time, and a review and criticism system was not established. A democratic discussion was immediately launched to determine that mutual aid accounts should be thoroughly settled immediately, a leadership system should be established, and free jumping and merging of groups should be allowed to adjust mutual aid members. After inspecting the idea that "if production is not led, the masses will also do it", cadres in the first district of Anyang mobilized the leadership to form mutual aid groups of ten or twenty households. Cadres in the Jinqu base village in Licheng liquidated their complacent thoughts on past production work, and then led the village's 55 laborers to form teams for unified mobilization. According to the long-term struggle situation with the stubborn and puppet troops, the first and sixth districts of Anyang proposed to arm and defend the autumn harvest, stipulating: First, ensure that no grain enters the village; second, first harvest the crops of the families of resistance members and militia participating in the war; third, reorganize the joint defense and strengthen command work; fourth, support the masses in Hedong to rush harvest. Many areas in the entire district have formulated precise methods for calculating work hours. Jinqu in Licheng stipulates that each mu of cotton harvested requires five work points, including carrying and cutting. Each mu of millet requires one and a half work points, and each mu of corn requires one work point. In this way, the autumn harvest can be completed in 24 days. Furthermore, six livestock can plow fifteen mu of land per day, which is estimated to be completed in 21 days. Jinqu in Licheng also democratically formulated reasonable autumn harvest work conversion methods, stipulating that carrying one load of grain from a distant place is equivalent to 0.1 work points, and carrying one load of grain from a nearby place is equivalent to 0.05 work points. Picking 12 jin of cotton by auxiliary labor is equivalent to one work point, and each work point is determined to be paid 12 jin of rice.
