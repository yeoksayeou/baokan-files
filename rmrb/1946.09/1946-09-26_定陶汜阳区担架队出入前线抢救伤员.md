　　Dingtao Siyang District Stretcher Team
　　Goes to the Front Lines to Rescue the Wounded
[Our Frontline Reporters Group, 23rd dispatch] The reporter recently encountered the people from Dingtao Siyang District participating in the war at the front line of Liugang Village (northwest corner of Cao County). The 30 stretchers from the district have been participating in the war for nearly a month, but everyone is full of energy and says, "We will not go back until we drive away the invaders and receive merit certificates." Lu Laili, who always has a tobacco pipe in his hand, said, "I had never seen planes and cannons before, and thought they were amazing, but now that I'm used to it, it's just like this! I learned how to hide and use the terrain with everyone, and I don't run around when the planes come, I know how to hide." Deputy District Chief Sun Yongjin not only leads by example and cares about everyone's life, but also promptly exposes rumors spread by individual bad elements, and at the same time spreads news of victory to boost morale. Once, he took five stretchers to the front, the sound of guns and cannons was very close, and they had already reached the edge of the village, but a spy whispered in the middle, "There are still five li, the enemy's machine guns are blocking the road." When he heard this, he immediately shouted loudly: "We've arrived, everyone don't listen to the bad guys spreading rumors!" As a result, no one was scattered, and the spy was found out. Usually, he always leads the way, so no one has ever been scattered in emergencies. Everyone says, "The district chief is still in front, what am I afraid of?" Activists Zhang Qiaocun and Kong Xianming are already 45 years old, and have sores on their shoulders, swollen as big as steamed buns, and cracked, but he always carries the stretcher and doesn't let others take his shift. When others ask him, "Doesn't it hurt?" He said, "What is this to me? Look at the wounded on the stretcher, they are really in pain." Li Xianyun from He Village used to be a soldier in the Longhai Detachment, but he retired after being wounded in the arm. One night, the stretcher team went to the aid station to carry the wounded. The battle was tight and the shells were dense. Everyone lay down and dared not go. He immediately said, "The wounded are waiting in front, the shells are far away, it doesn't matter, everyone listen to my command, crawl when I say crawl, don't mess up, it's guaranteed not to be hit." As a result, they were not frightened by the shells and carried all the wounded down. Wu Xihe from Jia Lou is only seventeen years old, a tall and strong young man. He goes to carry the wounded day and night, regardless of whether it's his shift or not. He often says, "My family used to be tenant farmers, and now everyone has five mu of land. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, how could we have this situation?" So when he hears that there are wounded in front, he can't sit still and forgets all fatigue. Under the influence of these activists, the Siyang District stretcher team has successfully completed every task. (Wu Xiang)

　　定陶汜阳区担架队
　　出入前线抢救伤员
    【本报前线记者团廿三日电】记者日前于刘岗村（曹县西北角）前线遇见定陶汜阳区参战的群众，该区三十付担架参战已近月，但每个人都精神饱满，都说：“不等到把进犯者赶走，领到了功劳证，决不回去。”烟袋不离手的吕来离说：“从前没见过飞机大炮，以为怎么样了不起，现在见惯了，也不过这么回事！我跟大家学会了隐蔽身体、利用地形，飞机来也不乱跑，知道怎么躲了。”副区长孙永近，不仅以身作则，关心大家生活，并且及时揭破个别坏分子造谣，同时传播胜利消息，鼓动情绪。有一次，他带五付担架向前边去，枪炮声很近，已经走到村边，特务却在中间小声说：“还有五里，敌人机枪把路堵住了”，他听见，立即大声喊道：“已经到了，大家不要听坏蛋造谣！”结果，一个人也没有跑散，特务也查出来了。平常他总在前边领头，所以遇到紧急情况都没有跑散过，大家都说：“区长还在前面呢，我怕啥？”积极分子张桥村、孔宪明、已经四十五岁了，肩上还长有疮，肿的同馒头那么大，而且裂开了口，但是他总是抬着担架不让别人换班，别人问他：“你不痛吗？”他却说：“我这算啥？你看担架上的彩号才真是痛呢。”何庄栗贤云，过去是陇海支队的战士，后来胳膊上挂彩退伍了，有一夜担架队去救护站抬彩号，战事正紧，炮弹很密，大家都爬下不敢走了，他立刻说：前边彩号等着，炮弹还远，不碍事，大家听我指挥，叫“爬就爬下，不要乱，保险打不倒。”结果，没有叫炮弹吓住，把彩号都搬了下来。贾楼吴希和才十七岁，小伙子长得又高大又结实，他是不分昼夜不管轮不轮到班，听见有彩号就去抬，他常说：“我家过去是佃户，现在每个人有了五亩地，不是共产党、八路军，那来这光景？所以他听见前边有彩号，就坐不住，什么疲劳也忘记了。在这些积极分子的影响下，汜阳区的担架队圆满的完成了每一次的任务。                  （吴象）
