　　Shanghai is awash in American goods, from powdered milk, biscuits, condensed milk, oranges, lemons, and all kinds of canned meats and vegetables for consumption, to glass belts, perfumes, soaps, fountain pens, ink, and leather shoes for use, to clothing and radios for entertainment. The vast majority of these goods are smuggled in. According to incomplete statistics from the Jianghai Customs in July, the value of smuggled goods seized at the end of July alone was 100 million yuan, which is only a small fraction of the total smuggled goods. According to the Peiping Yi Shi Bao, the lost tariff revenue each month is at least one-half (based on a tariff of 2.8 million yuan in July), so the evaded tax revenue is also this amount, and the value of smuggled goods is at least several times this amount.
　　The main reason for smuggling is that Chiang Kai-shek sold out navigation rights, allowing American ships to travel freely in China's territorial waters and inland rivers without needing to notify military or police authorities, nor being subject to inspection by the Jianghai Customs. American military aircraft flying from India and Manila can land directly at Chinese airports, which is a major source of large-scale smuggling. Secondly, bureaucratic comprador capitalists collude with relief material ships and high-ranking sailors on merchant ships, transporting goods directly ordered from the United States. Not long ago, there was also a fleet smuggling incident. Chiang Kai-shek's "New Fleet" arrived in Nanjing via Shanghai, and the markets in Nanjing and Shanghai were flooded with cigarettes, handkerchiefs, and fountain pens they brought. After this incident, naval officers said: "We are allowed to bring things by Minister Chen Ci-xiu (Chen Cheng)." Thirdly, the so-called "foreign single-handedly operators" have close relationships with foreign merchants and shipping companies, frequently traveling between the United States, Manila, and Shanghai, and bribing customs officers to transport goods to Shanghai as luggage, paying only very light luggage tax. As for the "Yellow Bull Party," they are small fry in smuggling, but they also have considerable influence. They can go directly to ships outside the Huangpu River estuary, transport goods to Yangshupu by sampan, with hundreds of people and dozens of sampans loading nearly ten trucks, and are protected by armed personnel, and have connections with the water police and customs officers, earning more than three thousand U.S. dollars per ship, about 11 million legal tender. People compete to smuggle because smuggling can yield staggering profits. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on August 26, the survey of smuggling prices shows that military raincoats and glass raincoats earn three times the profit, toothbrushes, glass combs, and glass belts earn four times the profit, Telmont Kaxiu and Kata milk powder earn four and a half times the profit, and Burowa hand pats, Huizi, and glass belts earn five to five and seven times the profit, radios and Camel cigarettes earn six to six and three times the profit, and exquisite ties earn up to eight times the profit.
　　Faced with cheap and good-quality smuggled American goods, national industries are on the verge of destruction. The current situation is comparable only to the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods from 1935 onwards, but the threat to national industries is even greater than it was then.

### 上海的走私

　　上海的走私
    上海滩上，充满了美国的商品，从吃的奶粉、饼干、炼乳、橘子、柠檬、各种肉类蔬菜罐头、用的玻璃裤带、香水香皂、钢笔墨水、皮鞋，穿的衣服，直到听的无线电，这些货物绝大多数是由走私而来。据江海关七月份不完全统计，单是七月底查获走私货品价值即一万万元，还只是占全部走私货的九牛一毛。据北平益世报估计，每月所损失的关税至少有二分之一（按七月份关税为二百八十万万元），那末漏掉的税收也有此数，而走私货物的货值则至少又数倍于此。
    走私的原因主要是由于蒋介石出卖航权，美舰畅行中国领海和内河，既不需通知军警当局，也不受江海关检查，而从印度、马尼拉飞来的美军用机可直接降落于中国机场，这是大量走私的主要来源；其次是官僚买办资本家他们联络了救济物资船只和商船上的高等海员，把直接从美国订购的货品源源运来。不久前还发生舰队走私事件，蒋介石的“新舰队”经上海抵达南京，京沪市场就充塞他们带来的香烟、手帕、钢笔等。此事发生后，海军官员们说：“我们带东西是陈辞修（陈诚）部长允许我们的。”再次是所谓外洋单帮与洋商辆船公司有着密切关系，经常往来美国、马尼拉与上海之间，并贿赂海关关员把货物照行李包扎办法运到上海，只付极轻微的行李税。至于“黄牛党”还是走私的小巫，但他们的神通亦颇广大，可以直接到黄浦江口外船上去，用划子运到杨树浦一带登陆，动轧几百人几十只划子近十辆卡车装载，而且有武装保护，与水警关员都有联络，每船呆赚三千多美金，约合法币一千一百万元。人们的竞争走私是因为走私可得惊人的利润。据八月二十六日上海大公报所载：走私买卖价格的调查军用雨衣及玻璃雨衣获利三倍，牙刷、玻璃梳、玻璃裤带获利四倍，台尔蒙咖修、克他奶粉获利四倍半，布洛瓦手拍、惠子、玻璃带获利五倍到五倍七，无线电及骆驼香烟获利六倍到六倍三，精致领带则获利至八倍。
    在价廉物美的走私美货面前，民族工业便临到了毁灭的危机。目前的情形只有一九三五年起的日货大走私可与比拟，但对民族工业的威胁却比那时还大。
