　　Handan Holds Grand Cadre Evening Party
    Warmly Welcome General Kong Congzhou
    [Our newspaper's Handan dispatch, 1st] Yesterday, more than a thousand cadres from various organs in Handan held a grand evening party at the Handan Theater to warmly welcome General Kong Congzhou, commander of the 55th Division of the 38th Army, who revolted in Gongxian, Henan. Yang Rongzheng and Bo Yibo, deputy political commissar of the military region, as well as the heads of various organs and departments, all attended. In an atmosphere full of excitement and laughter, Comrade Ren Baige, director of the Political Propaganda Department of the military region, announced the opening of the meeting. Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government, with a smile on his face, welcomed General Kong Congzhou on behalf of the 30 million people of the Border Region with indescribable pleasure. He said: "The 38th Army of the Northwest Army, which resolutely opposes the civil war, had the 17th Division revolt in Luoning last year, and now there is another revolt by the 55th Division. This is a great force. This is a great excitement for the military and civilians in the liberated areas who are carrying out patriotic self-defense operations, and a heavy blow to the dictatorial civil war Jiang Jieshi group. Tonight, I very sincerely welcome General Kong and his entourage. In the future, I will also explain the uprising of the 55th Division to the people of the entire region, so that the people of the entire region will know about this matter." Amid three sensational rounds of applause, General Kong was invited to speak. Wearing a dark blue military uniform, excessive excitement and agitation made him unable to speak at first. After expressing his heartfelt gratitude for this grand welcome, he said very angrily: "In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the elders, brothers, sisters, and siblings of the whole country have suffered all the suffering in the world, and finally crushed the invasion of the Japanese devils. Who doesn't want to live a few happy days after the victory? Chiang Kai-shek's fascist reactionaries do not allow the people of the whole country to live this kind of life. He wants to be a dictator, eliminate dissidents, and instead start a civil war." At this point, Division Commander Kong firmly stated: "No! We have the strong people's power of the liberated areas, and people across the country who advocate peace and democracy, and will never allow the reactionaries to run rampant! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the military and civilians of the liberated areas will surely crush Chiang Kai-shek's civil war offensive." After the meeting, the Peking University Turn-Over Drama Troupe performed "The White-Haired Girl", and the welcome party did not end until late at night.

　　邯市举行盛大干部晚会
    热烈欢迎孔从周将军
    【本报邯郸一日电】昨日邯市各机关干部千余人于邯郸戏院举行盛大晚会，热烈欢迎河南巩县起义的三十八军五十五师师长孔从周将军。边区政府杨戎正副主席，军区薄副政委以及各机关各部门首长，均一一出席参加。在充满着兴奋欢笑的气氛中，军区政治宣传部长任白戈同志宣布开会。边府杨主席满脸堆着笑容，他以说不出的愉快心情，代表边区三千万人民欢迎孔从周将军。他说：“坚决反对内战的西北军三十八军，去年有十七师在洛宁起义，现在又有五十五师的起义，这是一个伟大的力量，这对正在进行爱国自卫作战的解放区军民，是一个很大的兴奋，对独裁内战的蒋介石集团却是一个重重的打击。今晚我非常诚恳的欢迎孔将军及其随员，今后我还要把五十五师起义事件，向全区人民解释，使全区人民都知道这件事情。”在三次轰动的掌声中，孔将军被邀讲话，他穿着藏青色军服，过度的兴奋与激动使他开初说不出话来。他对这次盛大的欢迎表示万分感谢以后，即非常愤恨的说：“抗战八年，全国父老兄弟姊妹，受尽了一切人间的痛苦，最后才粉碎了日本鬼子的侵略，谁不想在胜利之后过几天快乐的日子？蒋介石法西斯反动派他不让全国人民过这种日子，他想独裁，消灭异己，反打开了内战。”至此，孔师长坚决表示：“不行！我们有着解放区强大的人民力量，有着全国主张和平民主的人士，决不允许反动派猖狂下去！解放区军民在毛主席朱总司令的领导下，一定会粉碎蒋介石的内战进攻。”会后，北大翻身剧团演出“白毛女”，欢迎会至夜深始散。
