The Liberated Tank Brigade
    Frontline Reporter Report

    The Longhai Counter-Offensive began at midnight on the 10th. Eleven tanks belonging to the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment of the Armored兵教导纵队 (Armored Forces Training Corps) of the Chiang Kai-shek’s military and political department, stationed at Lanfeng Railway Station, fiercely pounced on our army's positions. The soldiers shouted loudly, "You want to use tanks to eliminate us, but we will eliminate you on the tanks!" Soldiers, thirty to fifty meters away from the tanks along the railway, scattered and concealed themselves, heavily surrounding the tank fleet. The tanks advanced under the cover of intense artillery fire. Our Company Commander Li Huage commanded the entire company, and a barrage of hand grenades drove the tanks back. The tracks of the second tank were destroyed, and it stopped moving on the road. Soldier Yue Binghua, after throwing four hand grenades, lay in a pool of blood, covered in honorable wounds. He angrily and proudly shouted: "Who says tanks are not afraid of hand grenades? Look at the tank stopped over there!"
    Subsequently, the Chiang army organized a second counterattack. The brave soldiers used dense firepower to bombard the tanks. Shells pierced the "569," a nine-and-a-half-ton heavy tank, and it immediately burst into flames, killing three and wounding two of the Chiang soldiers. The tank unit retreated like turtles.
    Inside Lanfeng city, street-by-street combat had unfolded by 2:00 PM. From 4:00 AM on the 11th, Xu Wenqing, the regimental commander of the 220th Regiment of the Chiang army, issued one order after another to his combat troops, telling them to rush into the city to reinforce. The tanks reorganized for a third offensive, even reaching the command post of our army's ×× Regiment. More than a hundred wounded soldiers who had just been carried down from the front line, along with their comrades and the regimental commander, urgently prepared for battle. They struggled to get up, and a barrage of hand grenades drove the tanks back again. In the afternoon, conflicts arose between the Chiang army's tank soldiers and infantry; the tank soldiers advocated breaking through and fleeing during the day, while the infantry wanted to flee at night. As a result, the tank soldiers began to break through at 4:00 PM, but they inevitably had to return from where they came, unable to cope with the Liberation Army's rain of hand grenades. Finally, four of the eleven tanks were destroyed, and over a hundred tank soldiers, forty of whom suffered pointless casualties.
    The Liberation Army began its final annihilating counterattack. Three mountain howitzer shells directly hit the tank command post - the railway station ticket office. The firing from the tanks gradually weakened. Hearing the earnest calls from our brave soldiers, they began to waver. At this time, more than three hundred Chiang soldiers laid down their weapons. When they heard again, "Don't be cannon fodder for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, as long as you lay down your weapons, your safety is guaranteed," a tank technician was the first to jump off a tank. A burst of enthusiastic applause erupted from our army's position. Then, a white flag appeared on a tank, and the battle immediately ceased. The battlefield turned into a celebration, the sound of gunfire transformed into cheers of friendship, and the People's Army and the tank soldiers who laid down their arms joyfully shook hands.
    On the night of the 11th, the tanks, shining brightly, drove happily into the liberated areas, warmly welcomed along the way. Second Lieutenant and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Jianying exclaimed: "During the War of Resistance against Japan, we didn't use tanks to fight the enemy. Now, we are using tanks to fight the liberated areas, and we completely disagree. In this battle, several of my good friends sacrificed their lives for Chiang Kai-shek's internal war and treachery. I feel both sad and resentful." Finally, Lieutenant Zhang stated: "For peace, I am willing to contribute all my abilities. My future efforts will truly be for the people!"

　　被解放的坦克队
    前线记者报导
    十日午夜，陇海自卫反击作战开始了。停在兰封车站上的蒋介石军政部装甲兵教导纵队二团一营、战车第一连的十一辆坦克，凶恶的向我军阵地扑来，战士们高声喊着：“你想用坦克消灭我们，我们就把你消灭在坦克上！”在距坦克三十米及五十米的铁路旁战士们散开荫蔽着，重重包围着坦克车群。坦克车在猛烈的炮火掩护下，向前推进，我们的李华格连长，指挥着全连，一阵手榴弹，将坦克反击回去了。第二辆坦克链子被炸毁，停在路上不能动转。战士岳丙华，刚投完四颗手榴弹，身挂重彩，躺在血泊里，他气愤而又骄傲的喊着：“谁说坦克不怕手榴弹？看看停在那里的坦克！”
    接着蒋军又组织第二次反扑，勇士们用密集火力，向坦克轰击。炮弹打穿了“五六九”号、九吨半的那辆重型坦克，立刻燃烧起来，三个蒋军一死两伤，坦克队又象乌龟一样缩回头去。
    兰封城内，于下午两点已经展开逐屋战，从十一日晨四时起，蒋军二二○团的许文庆团长，给战军连下一道命令，又一道命令，叫他们冲进城内增援，坦克又重新组织第三次进攻，一直冲到我军××团的指挥所，新从火线上抬下来的一百多个彩号，随着弟兄们团长急起应战，他们都挣扎着爬起来，一阵手榴弹又把坦克打回去。午后蒋军，坦克兵与步兵发生了矛盾；坦克兵主张白天突围逃窜，步兵要晚上逃窜，结果坦克兵在午后四点钟开始突围，但是它们从那里来，照旧还得回到那里去，他们没办法对付解放军暴雨似的手榴弹。终于十一辆坦克被击毁了四辆，百多坦克兵，其中四十个惨遭无谓伤亡。
    解放军开始最后歼灭性的反击，三发山炮弹，完全命中了坦克指挥所——火车站票房，坦克上的射击，也逐渐稀疏起来，他们听了我们勇士亲切的喊话，开始动摇了。这时候蒋军三百余步兵，放下了武器，当再次听到不要替卖国贼蒋介石当炮灰，只要放下武器，保证生命安全。一位坦克技师首先从车上跳下来，我军阵地响起一片热烈的掌声，接着坦克上出现了一面白旗，战斗即刻停止了，这时战场变成了联欢会场，枪声变成了一片友谊的欢呼声，人民军队与蒋军放下武器的坦克兵，愉快的握起手来了。
    十一号晚上坦克车放射着明亮的火光，欢天喜地的开到解放区，沿途备受欢迎。少尉副排长张剑萤感叹地说：“抗战时期，没有用坦克与敌人作战，现在用坦克来打解放区我们完全不同意，这次战斗中，我的几位好朋友都为蒋介石内战卖国送掉了性命，我心里又难过又痛恨。最后，张少尉表示：为和平，我愿贡献出我所有的能力，今后的努力，才真是为人民的！
