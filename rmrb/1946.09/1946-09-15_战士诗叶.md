Editor's Note: Over the past year, the soldiers under the command of Commander-in-Chief Gao of the Democratic Allied Army have witnessed the earth-shaking emancipation movement of the masses in the liberated areas, personally experienced the democratic and happy life, and recently conducted current affairs studies. They have further recognized the crimes of the old society and Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, and deeply understood the purpose and great achievements of the Communist Party in saving China and the people. They sang the praises of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao on the wall newspapers of various battalions, fully revealing their simple enthusiasm and joy. Excerpts are as follows:
   (1) Ode to Chairman Mao
    The Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flag,
    China produced a great savior,
    If you ask who the savior is,
    It's the Communist leader Mao Zedong.
    He relieves the people of their suffering,
    He helped the poor to stand up,
    Leading the people to fight for peace.
     (Written by Song Suiwang)
    (2) Emancipation Poem
    Living in other people's houses,
    Cultivating other people's land,
    Eating bran and vegetables,
    Wearing tattered clothes.
    Spring plowing and summer hoeing,
    Never idle throughout the four seasons,
    Grain harvested at home,
    Landlords come to plunder.
    The good ones they take away,
    Leaving bran and chaff,
    The poor cry sadly,
    The landlord's heart is happy.
    ×        ×
    The Eighth Route Army leads us,
    Reducing rent and interest,
    The poor have stood up,
    The landlords lower their heads.
    Enjoying happiness through labor,
    Thank you, Chairman Mao.
    (Written by Hong Tan San)
    (3) Anti-Civil War Quick Rhyme
    Speaking of bastards, talking of bastards,
    China produced a big bastard,
    The big bastard Chiang Kai-shek,
    Relies on foreign countries to fight the civil war.
    With airplanes and cannons,
    And also steamships and warships.
    Good weapons do not take precedence,
    The soldiers are unwilling to fight,
    "The Japanese devils have surrendered,
    Why are we still fighting a civil war?"
    The more they think about it, the more angry they get,
    They run away with all their weapons.

　　战士诗叶
    编者按：一年来，民主建国军高总司令领导下的战士们，目睹解放区群众翻天覆地的翻身运动，亲身体验到民主幸福的生活，最近又进行了时事学习，进一步认识了旧社会和国民党蒋介石的罪恶，深刻的体会了共产党救中国救人民的宗旨与伟迹，他们在各营的壁报上歌颂共产党和毛主席，充分流露出他们淳朴的热情和愉快，兹摘录数则于后：
   （一）歌颂毛主席
    青天白日满地红，
    中国出了个大救星，
    要问救星是那个，
    中共领袖毛泽东。
    他为人民解痛苦，
    他叫穷人翻了身，
    领导人民争太平。
     （宋随旺作）
    （二）翻身小诗
    住的人家房，
    种的人家地，
    吃的糠和菜，
    穿的破烂衣。
    春犁夏锄地，
    四季不得闲，
    粮食打在家，
    地主来抢劫。
    好的他拿走，
    剩下糠和秕，
    穷人呜呜哭，
    地主心喜欢。
    ×        ×
    八路领导咱，
    减租又减息，
    穷人翻了身，
    地主把头低。
    劳动享幸福，
    谢谢毛主席。
    （洪潭三作）
    （三）反内战快板
    说混蛋道混蛋，
    中国出了个大混蛋，
    大混蛋蒋介石，
    依靠外国打内战。
    有飞机有大炮，
    还有火轮与战船。
    武器好不沾先，
    士兵们不好战，
    “日本鬼投了降，
    为何还叫打内战？”
    他们越想越生气，
    带着武器全跑完。
