　　It is said to be humane but it is truly hunger
    Chongqing rickshaw pullers rally
    Against the deadline to abolish rickshaws
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Chongqing News: The "Anti-Abolition of Rickshaws Conference," representing more than 20,000 rickshaw pullers, convened at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 7th of last month, passing a resolution to respond to the Shanghai-planned Rickshaw Federation, demanding that the government postpone the abolition of rickshaws until the 41st year of the Republic of China, and declaring all measures for phased abolition by the Public Works Bureau invalid. At the Rickshaw Federation meeting, Party and government officials sent by the Kuomintang authorities said: "Now is the era of abandoning the East and moving towards the West. No Western countries have rickshaws. Rickshaws are neither humane, scientific, nor economical, so they must be abolished." As for how to solve the unemployment problem after the abolition of rickshaws, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau said: "It is best for everyone to come up with their own ideas." The rickshaw pullers and owners unanimously opposed this. A rickshaw puller surnamed Wang said: "I spent 300,000 earned from my sweat to buy this rickshaw. If the government talks about humanity, then give me 300,000 yuan. Humanity is false; it is true that my stomach needs to eat." A rickshaw owner named Huang Hu said: "My rickshaws were bought by pawning my clothes. My nephew died without relatives or money, relying on these two rickshaws to survive." Another worker said: "Changing careers without capital is also impossible. Isn't it humane that 'Chairman Chiang' issued a 'hand order' for the sake of humanity, while 200,000 people starve?"

　　人道是假饿肚是真
    渝人力车夫集会
    反对限期废除人力车
    【新华社延安五日电】渝讯：代表二万多人力车夫的“反对废除人力车大会”，上月七日在市商会集会，通过议案响应上海所筹备的人力车联合会，要求政府将废除人力车展期至民国四十一年开始，宣布公务局限期分批废除办法一律无效。人力车联合会会上国民党当局所派的党政官员说：“现在是丢掉东洋走向西洋的时代，西洋各国都没有人力车，人力车既不人道又不科学也不经济，所以必须废除。”至于废除人力车后失业问题如何解决，社会局代表说：“最好是大家自己想法子。”人力车夫和车商们对此一致表示反对。一个王姓车夫说：“我以汗水换来的三十万买了这个车子，政府讲人道就给我三十万元。人道是假的，肚子要吃饭是真的。”一位车商黄胡氏说：“我的车子是当衣裤买来的，我的侄儿死了无亲无钱，靠这两部车子吊命。”另一工人说：“改业没有资本也不成，‘委座’就是为了人道发下‘手令’，二十万人饿肚子就算人道吗？”
