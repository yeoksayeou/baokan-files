　　[This Newspaper, Changzhi, 11th Dispatch] The relief supplies from UNRRA transported to our Shangdang District have arrived in Changzhi via Qin County, and part of them have been directly distributed in Qin County to Qin County, Qinyuan, Wuxiang, Yushe, and Xiangyuan counties. Mr. An Dingyuan, special representative of UNRRA, and Captain Yu of the Eighth Work Team of the Xingzheng Yuan's Jin-Sui-Cha Branch Office, and two others have also moved to Changzhi to work. A total of 143 bags of flour, 874 packages of used clothing, 483 packages of used leather shoes (mostly women's shoes), 5,251 boxes of milk (totaling over 230,000 catties), 148 barrels of milk powder (totaling over 19,000 catties), two boxes of medicine, and 50 boxes of used cotton yarn and other medical materials have been transported. These supplies will be immediately distributed to the 19 counties in eastern Jin, and the Eighth Work Team will cooperate with the relief associations of various counties for distribution. Medicines and medical materials will be distributed to church hospitals in Changzhi, Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Zuoquan, and to small hospitals in various counties. The distribution principle is to divide the counties into first, second, and third classes according to their population and disaster situation, and then distribute them specifically according to the situation in each place. This batch of relief supplies was originally transported to Qin County by Mr. An Dingyuan and others, but was detained by the traitor Duan Bingchang, who was then occupying Qin County, and could not be transported out, so it was delayed until today to arrive. Our government and the people of various places are very grateful for the hard work of Mr. An and others over the past six months. The various counties in southeastern Jin have been devastated by the Japanese puppets for eight or nine years, and this batch of supplies can heal the people's war wounds to a great extent. However, many people suffer from illnesses after the war, especially in the areas along the East Qin line ravaged by Yan's puppet troops. The medicines are too few this time, and the distribution is quite difficult. The liberated area lacks transportation, and more than 600 large vehicles were used to transport this batch of relief supplies to Changzhi. Therefore, all parties hope that relief supplies will continue to arrive, especially medicines and transportation.

　　联总安定远先生移长治办工
    沁武等五县分发物资
    晋察冀救济阎伪制造的大同灾民
    【本报长治十一日电】联总运至我上党区之救济物资，已由沁县抵长治，其中一部已在沁县直接分发于沁县、沁源、武乡、榆社、襄垣等五县。联总特派员安定远先生，及行总晋绥察分署第八工作队俞队长等一行三人，亦移长治办工。计共运来面粉一百四十三袋，旧衣八百七十四包，旧皮鞋（大部为女鞋）四百八十三包，牛奶五千二百五十一箱（合二十三万余斤），乳粉一百四十八桶（合一万九千余斤），药品两箱，旧棉纱布等医药材料五十箱。此等物资即时分发晋东十九县由第八工作队协同各县救济分会分发。药品及医药材料则将分予长治、晋城、阳城、左权等地教会医院，及各县小医院。分配原则系按各县人口及各县灾情分为一、二、三三等，然后按各地情况具体分发。按此批救济物资，早由安定远等先生运至沁县，因遭当时窃踞沁县之段逆炳昌扣留，无法运出，致迟至今日始得运达。我政府及各地人民对安先生等半年来之往返辛劳，均极感谢。晋东南各县遭日伪摧残蹂躏八九年，此批物资可疗补人民之战争创伤于万数。惟人民经战争之后，患病者甚多，尤以东沁沿线遭阎伪军蹂躏之地区为甚。此次医药品太少，分配颇感困难，解放区交通工具缺乏，此次运救济物资抵长治即用大车六百多辆。故各方均盼救济物资继续运到，尤望多运医药品与交通工具。
