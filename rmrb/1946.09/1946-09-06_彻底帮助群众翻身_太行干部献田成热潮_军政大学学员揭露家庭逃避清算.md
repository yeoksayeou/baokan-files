　　Thoroughly Help the Masses Overturn Their Lives
    Taihang Cadres' Land Donation Becomes a Craze
    Military and Political University Students Expose Families Evading Liquidation
    [Our Correspondent in Changzhi, 5th] In the Taihang region, cadres voluntarily donating land or persuading their families to donate land has become a craze. Following Gao Muhong, a respected figure in the cultural circles of Wuxiang County, who donated land, Hao Diantong, Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of Heshun County, donated 90 mu of land; Zhao Huanlian, Women's Rescue Committee member of Dongzhuang Village, First District of Wuxiang County, persuaded her husband to donate 50 mu of land; Dong Zhiqing, Supervisor of the PingShun County Government, donated 5 mu of land; Guo Shuxin, Deputy Speaker of the Huguan County Assembly, donated 6 mu of land and a house; Guo Naihe, Director of the Armed Forces Committee of Gaoqiu Village, Second District of Heshun County, donated 26 mu of land; and Guo Suozhou, the village chief, donated 27 mu of land and 12 rooms. Zhao Huaiyi, head of the Zuoquan Troupe, mobilized his father to donate 15 ingots of silver, 150 silver dollars, and 50 sheep, and said to the masses: "I feel very ashamed of exploiting the peasants' blood and sweat in the past. I have long wanted to donate it to the peasants, but I was afraid people would say I was being special. Seeing the land donations in various places reported in the newspaper has greatly influenced me. I feel very happy to donate it today." In addition, Li Jinzhu, a landlord from Shitou Village in the same county, took out 20 mu of land and donated it to his own hired laborers and two impoverished families, and handed over the original deed to express his determination.

    [Our Correspondent in Changzhi, 4th] A land donation movement has been launched by preparatory course students at the Military and Political University. After studying the problems of Chinese society and classes, and recognizing the suffering of peasants being exploited and oppressed and the laws of social development, the students' ideological awareness has been raised compared to before. Recently, encouraged by the land donation movement in various places, they have voluntarily donated land to help peasants overturn their lives. Lian Jingmin, a student from Xiangyuan County, wrote a letter to the Magistrate and Party Secretary of Xiangyuan County, detailing the inside story of his family evading liquidation and the reasons why the mass movement in the village has failed to develop, and sincerely hopes that the government will boldly and thoroughly solve the peasants' land problem. Currently, students from various teams at the Military and Political University have launched a land and money donation movement to help peasants overturn their lives. The students of one company have donated a total of 102 mu of land and 37 rooms. Many other students have donated their collections of jewelry and silver dollars. Currently, students in this area have been requesting leave to return home to persuade their families to donate land. In addition to commending them, the school authorities are also helping them deal with this issue.
    [Our Correspondent in Weixian, 4th] Comrade Han Yinting, head of the Independent Regiment of the Jinnan Military Region × Sub-district, voluntarily donated 59 mu of good farmland in his hometown of Yongnan District, Handan, to poor peasants. Comrade Han is a member of the Chinese Communist Party who has persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in Jinnan since the Anti-Japanese War and has made outstanding achievements. Recently, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee for "land to the tiller," he persuaded his family to leave a portion of land for self-cultivation and donate the majority of the land to the peasants, which was deeply supported by the villagers.
