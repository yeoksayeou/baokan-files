Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Paris dispatch: On the 26th and 27th, eleven subcommittees of the Peace Conference continued to meet for discussions. At these committee meetings, it became even more apparent that certain delegations were deliberately delaying the work of the conference. This was first evident in the Economic Committee meeting on Romania, Hungary, and Finland on the 26th, when the Australian representative opposed Romania paying reparations of $300 million to the Soviet Union and opposed paying reparations in goods, proposing instead that they be paid in US dollars and pounds sterling, and suggesting postponing the decision on the amount to be discussed by a special committee. The Soviet chief representative, Molotov, rose to object, saying: Australia's proposal is completely inconsistent with the armistice treaty concluded between the Allies and Romania. The provisions of the treaty regarding reparations were not only agreed to by the Soviet Union but also by the United Kingdom and the United States. The Romanian government also considers it justified. It seems that the Australian representative is more concerned about the interests of Romania than the Romanian government itself. Regarding the amount of reparations, Molotov opposed postponing the decision, pointing out that the total amount of reparations had already been determined, and the Romanian government had been paying it for two years. Molotov especially emphasized the Australian representative's proposal to pay reparations in US dollars and pounds sterling, believing that this would require Romania to sell commodities to foreign countries in exchange for US and British currency, making it economically dependent on the United States and the United Kingdom. Therefore, it can be seen that the Australian delegation is concerned about the interests of US dollars and pounds sterling. In conclusion, Molotov pointed out: The purpose of the Australian representative's proposal is to delay the resolution of important issues of the peace treaty, which is in line with the imperialist plan.
Secondly, it was evident in the Italian Political Action Committee on the 26th. The committee was close to passing the preamble to the Italian Peace Treaty that day, but it was delayed again due to an amendment proposed by the Australian representative regarding the establishment of a "Human Rights Court." Manuilsky strongly opposed the proposal for a "Human Rights Court," as it would violate Article 2 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, which prohibits the United Nations from interfering in matters that are purely internal affairs of any country. He demanded that Australia's plan be rejected immediately because the plan could provoke intense incidents.
Thirdly, it was evident in the Italian Political and Territorial Committee on the 26th, where the Australian representative again provoked a new debate, demanding the appointment of a special investigation committee to consider the reasons for territorial changes stipulated in the Four Powers' Italian Peace Treaty. Vyshinsky strongly opposed Australia's request to investigate the reasons for territorial changes and warned that if this proposal were accepted, it would extend the peace conference by four to six months. The Military Committee was still mired in procedural disputes at the general meeting on the 26th and had not begun discussions on the military clauses of the treaty.
Progressive public opinion in Britain and the United States has expressed dissatisfaction with the slow progress of the Peace Conference. Under the pressure of public opinion, according to a dispatch from the United Press, Byrnes finally agreed on the 25th to Bevin's proposal to convene a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and suggested that the meeting be held this Thursday to consider the amendments that the Peace Conference has already agreed to, and to consider what measures can be taken to facilitate the work of the Peace Conference.

　　苏联代表在和会小组会上
    斥澳代表企图拖延会期
    四外长会议将重新召开
    【新华社延安廿八日电】巴黎讯：二十六、二十七两日，和会有十一个小组委员会继续开会讨论，在这些委员会会议上，更进一步地表明某些代表团故意拖延和会的工作，这首先表现在二十六日罗保匈芬经委会上当讨论罗国赔款时，澳代表反对罗赔款三亿美元予苏联，并反对以商品支付赔款，而提议用美元和英磅支付，并提议延期决定款项数量，而交由专门委员会讨论。苏联首席代表莫洛托夫继起反对说：澳国的提议完全不符合盟国和罗马尼亚缔结的停战条约，该条约关于赔款的规定不但苏联同意，而且英美也同意，罗马尼亚政府亦认为是正当的，澳洲代表似乎比罗政府自己更关心罗国的利益。关于赔款数目问题，莫洛托夫反对延期决定，提出赔款总数早已确定，两年来罗政府已在支付。莫洛托夫特别强调澳代表主张用美元及英磅支付赔款的提议，认为这是要罗马尼亚向外国出卖商品以换取美英货币，变成在经济上依赖美英，因此可见澳代表团关心的是美元与英磅的利益。莫洛托夫在结语中指出：澳代表这一提议的目的在于延期解决和约的重要问题，这是合乎帝国主义的计划。
    其次表现在二十六日意大利政治行动委员会上，该委员会当天本来对意和约的序言已接近通过，但却又山于澳洲代表提出的关于设立“人权法庭”一项修正案而拖延下来。曼奴意斯基强烈反对“人权法庭”的建议案，因这将是破坏联合国宪章第七章第二条，该款禁止联合国干涉任何一国的纯粹的内政事情。他要求立刻否决澳大利亚的计划，因为该计划能挑拨激烈的事件。
    再次表现在二十六日的意政治领土委员会上，澳洲代表在会上又挑起了新的激辩，要求任命特别调查委员会，以考虑四强在意国和约中规定领土变更之理由。维辛斯基强调地反对澳洲调查领土变更之理由之要求，并警告称：假使接受此一建议，将延长和会四个月到六个月。军事委员会在二十六日大会上仍陷于程序之争，并未开始和约中军事条文的讨论。
    英美进步舆论已对和会的进展迟慢表示不满，在舆论的压力下，据合众社电称：贝纳斯已于二十五日终于同意贝文关于召开四外长会议的提议，并建议召开日期为本星期四，以考虑和会所已经同意的修正案，并考虑能够做到那些办法便利和会的工作。
