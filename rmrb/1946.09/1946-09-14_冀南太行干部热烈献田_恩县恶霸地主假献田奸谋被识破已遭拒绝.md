　　Cadres in Southern Hebei and Taihang enthusiastically donate land
    The En County evil landlord's plot to falsely donate land is seen through and rejected
    [This newspaper, Weixian News] The land donation movement in Southern Hebei continues to develop. Comrade Han Quanyi, Chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Nanhe County Government, donated 37 mu of good land on the 27th of last month. Mr. Jin Kexiao, a landlord from Cigaotian Village and a family member of a resistance fighter, had long been engaged in anti-Japanese activities under enemy and puppet rule, uniting intellectuals in the township and organizing a cultural troupe to serve the people. In the recent peasant emancipation movement, he actively mobilized his family and generously donated 100 mu of land and two empty houses to the farmers in the village on August 20. In En County, many evil landlords tried to take advantage of the land donation movement, also expressing their intention to donate land, but secretly they greatly insulted and attempted to paralyze the masses. Their conspiracy has been seen through by the peasants, who unanimously refused to accept it, and launched an accusation and liquidation movement.
    [This newspaper] The land donation movement in the Taihang area is rapidly developing. In the four villages of Nanjia Bi, Shangzhai, Shuiyuzi, and Beichakou in Cixian County's Sixth District alone, cadres and enlightened gentry donated 277 mu. Comrade Wang Hui, a staff member of the County Government, donated 30 mu of land and 24 houses. Mr. Tian Jiyu, father of Tian Yumin, Deputy Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, donated 151 mu of land, which was deeply supported by the masses. Everyone said, "Only cadres under the leadership of the Communist Party can plan for the people like this." Comrade Ling Erwen, an anti-Japanese soldier from Lijiazhuang Village in Xiyang County, donated 14 mu of land to the farmers in his village on August 21. The masses, in addition to supporting this, also expressed that they would pay more attention to taking care of his family life and production in the future. Zhang Zhang, Mayor of Jiaozuo City, donated 40 mu of good land to the masses, and Li Changtian, Secretary of the Municipal Government, also obtained his family's consent to donate 10 mu of good land.
