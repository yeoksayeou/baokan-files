　　First of all, I want to raise a question: Does everyone think that the current situation might ease up again? Being far from the front lines, it's very possible to think that way; but the reality is exactly the opposite. Now that a major battle has passed, the Kuomintang reactionaries, severely battered, are actively preparing, and troop movements are frequent. Even more intense battles are about to begin on all fronts.

　　The recent national war situation is as follows: (1) Central China Battlefield: The New Fourth Army, under the command of Su Yu, has achieved seven victories in seven battles, ranking first among all liberated areas nationwide, eliminating a total of 60,000 troops of Tang Enbo's forces. This includes: one division headquarters (formerly army headquarters), seven brigades (formerly divisions), five companies, and one transportation corps (seven battalions), recovering 19 important villages and towns. Captured Kuomintang 99th Brigade (formerly division, same below) Brigade Commander, Deputy Brigade Commander, Chief of Staff, 187th Brigade Commander and Deputy Commander, 26th Brigade Commander and Deputy Commander, 105th Brigade Deputy Commander, 7th Brigade Deputy Commander, and other officers and soldiers totaling over 35,000. Killed and wounded over 20,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers, including Deputy Division Commander of the 49th Division, Wang Kejun. Captured a large amount of equipment, including: 3 field guns, 15 mountain guns, 12 Type 92 guns, 5 anti-aircraft guns, 2 old anti-aircraft guns, 74 mortars, 30 American-made rocket launchers, 226 grenade launchers, 5 anti-aircraft guns, 134 heavy machine guns, 1,190 light machine guns, 163 submachine guns, 697 "Tommy" submachine guns, 209 Maxim machine guns, 9,260 rifles, and over 2 million rounds of various bullets and shells, which equipped ourselves. Didn't the newspapers report "We now have American-equipped divisions!"? The situation in Central China is currently at a stalemate, with the Kuomintang actively mobilizing troops. (2) Xuzhou Front: Xue Yue's 35 brigades attacked us, occupying our Suqian, Juining, Huaiyin and other cities. The enemy's northward advance stopped at Taierzhuang. Due to excessive rainfall and flooding, movement is difficult, so our main forces cannot launch a large-scale counterattack. This area is the center of the national battlefield and of great importance. (3) Shandong Jiaoji Railway Line: Wang Yaowu's attacking forces, totaling 15 brigades, were reduced by nearly two brigades by us in early September. Wang's forces have occupied 19 important counties and towns including Gaomi, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Zichuan, Boping, Linzi, Zhangqiu, and Shaoping, and our army has successively recovered Jiyang, Huantai, Guangrao and other three county towns. The war situation is evolving. (4) Datong Area: Parts of the main forces of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Sui are attacking Datong, our center of gravity, and have already occupied Datong North Gate Airport and Railway Station. Fu Zuoyi mobilized all 11 of his regiments, occupying our Zhuozishan. His Provisional 3rd Army (two divisions) was completely wiped out by our army, and fierce fighting is currently taking place around Jining. (5) Rehe, Eastern Hebei: The Kuomintang occupies our Chengde, Chifeng, Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Xianghe, Qian'an, Leting, and other places with five divisions (formerly armies). Our army counterattacked and recovered Lulong, Bencheng, and Dushan. (6) Fifth Division Area: After breaking through the encirclement in the Central Plains, General Li Xiannian's troops have successfully established two base areas. One is the Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi base area directly led by General Li Xiannian, divided into four military sub-districts. The other is the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area established by General Wang Shusheng, also divided into four military sub-districts. Now is their great opportunity to expand. This is precisely the actual irony of the Kuomintang reactionaries' claim that "Li Xiannian's troops no longer exist," and another proof of the invincibility of the people's army. (7) Regarding the Ji-Lu-Yu area around the border region: Ji-Lu-Yu has become one of the main battlefields in the country. Following the initial victory on the Longhai Railway, our army recently killed or wounded more than 17,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops in Ji-Lu-Yu, annihilating their entire Third Division and Forty-seventh Division, and severely damaging the Forty-first Division. One of the two pincers of Chiang Kai-shek's army attacking our Ji-Lu-Yu area has been wounded, and Bai Chongxi's carefully laid out formation has suffered a severe blow. Liu Zhi, who was in charge of the frontline command, has been dismissed and replaced by Gu Zhutong. Now Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng have personally come to Xinxiang to make arrangements, and continue to mobilize large armies to attack. The battle is taking place near Heze. The deeper the Chiang Kai-shek troops penetrate, the more advantageous it is for us to annihilate their main forces. Everyone must recognize that today's battles are not about the gains and losses of one city or one place, but about annihilating their main forces. A major battle is about to unfold, and the rear must support it with a thousand times the effort. (8) Taiyue Area: After annihilating one brigade of Hu Zongnan's forces, Commander Chen Geng's troops marched north, recovering the five county towns of Hong, Zhao, Huo, Ling, and Fenxi, and controlling more than 280 li of the Tongpu Railway. Our area and the Jin-Sui Lvliang Military Region are now connected. Now Hu Zongnan in southern Shanxi has mobilized eight brigades (formerly divisions) to advance north along the Tongpu Railway, occupying our Yuanqu, Jiangxian, Yicheng, Wenxi and other cities. But because his forces are insufficient, and the battle line is too long, he is at a disadvantage and cannot make a major incursion. He is planning to transfer troops from southern Shaanxi to the Tongpu Railway for combat. A major battle is brewing.

　　Considering the above situation, it does not indicate that the situation may ease, but rather that new, larger-scale, and more intense battles are brewing. Looking at the reactionaries' active arrangements, a new major battle is about to begin. We must not be proud and negligent because of our victories. Difficult tasks still lie ahead. Moreover, we must not fail to see the intense struggles ahead and become paralyzed. Paralysis will inevitably lead to a slackening of fighting spirit, and we will inevitably suffer losses. To give an example, Wenxi County in the Taiyue area lost ×× shi of public grain. This is a very painful lesson. Fierce battles on a national scale will begin immediately! Read the Liberation Daily's editorial "Chiang Kai-shek's Army Will Be Defeated" carefully, and eliminate illusions about the Sino-US reactionaries and the idea that peace can be achieved easily.

　　I think the news about the Five-Man Committee may have caused some illusions for some comrades. If so, then we lack too much understanding of the Sino-US reactionaries and the current situation. Facts have proven that Marshall is actually implementing a one-sided policy of aiding Chiang and opposing communism, and it can no longer be said that he is pursuing a two-sided policy. The American imperialist elements hope that Chiang Kai-shek will work for them, and "fear the rise of the Chinese Communist Party like the Yugoslav or Polish Communist Parties." Therefore, they do not want China to have genuine democracy and peace. Recently, foreign newspapers in Shanghai openly asked: "Is Marshall mediating the Chinese civil war? Or is he the commander-in-chief directing the US-Chiang coalition forces to fight the Communists?" Even foreigners are raising such questions. The facts of the past year have educated us to more deeply understand the US colonial policy towards China and the essence of Marshall's mediation. Marshall's devoted mediation always occurs when we win battles, giving Chiang Kai-shek time to reorganize his troops and make a comeback. Currently, our army is winning major victories, and Marshall has once again proposed convening a Five-Man Committee to resolve the issue of National Government members. However, the condition of "issuing a nationwide ceasefire order immediately after reaching an agreement," which the CCP representatives firmly insisted on, was firmly rejected by Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall expressed his inability to do anything about it. Is he really unable to do anything? Who believes it! Everyone knows that without US support, Chiang Kai-shek would not dare to be so rampant and unreasonable. Therefore, even if the Five-Man Committee is formed, it will only be another way to buy time for Chiang Kai-shek in order to implement his policy of eliminating us. The US President has already stated that the policy of aiding Chiang will not change, and is actively engaging in bloody transactions. The Wallace speech incident was so ridiculously amusing! Although the voices of American democrats opposing this are loud, the American reactionaries are still turning a deaf ear. Judging from this news, what basis is there to allow us to harbor illusions about the convening of the Five-Man Committee? In the past, we overestimated peace, and we have already suffered losses. We should recognize that even if the Five-Man Committee is formed and an agreement is reached, it will still be a delaying tactic, and the Kuomintang will still break it at any time. How good were the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and how pleasant were Chiang Kai-shek's promises? Haven't they all been torn up? Isn't this a painful lesson? Comrades who still harbor illusions about the Sino-US reactionaries should carefully consider the facts of the past and the present. Only when the people's strength becomes stronger and inflicts a crushing blow on the American-backed Chinese reactionaries, will there be a more genuine peace conference. But the struggle will not stop.

　　Regarding the comrades' thinking and work tasks, I would like to talk about them again.

　　As far as I know, the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the Ji-Lu-Yu front aim to "annihilate Liu Bocheng's main force, take Heze, occupy Puyang, and open up the Pinghan Railway." They have concentrated 50 brigades (formerly divisions) of troops (one-fourth of their total force) in the Ji-Lu-Yu, northern Jiangsu, and southern Shandong areas, and the main thrust is now attacking our area. The victory in Ji-Lu-Yu is related to the overall situation, and it is especially important to our area. The situation is extremely tense. According to news from the front, morale is high, and they are confident in crushing the attackers, as long as all the government and people in the front and rear can provide timely support to the front line with maximum effort. Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng said: There is no problem with winning battles on the front line. The difficulty is that the rear transportation is too slow, and ammunition, food, and manpower cannot be supplied in time. Our side also suffered considerable casualties in this operation. I was moved to tears when I read the communication about the "Battle of Dayang Lake"! The frontline soldiers are fighting so bravely, one after another, sacrificing themselves, and using their own bodies to carry out siege operations. How should we, the comrades in the rear, and all the people in the border region, comfort them and fulfill our responsibilities! In the past, some comrades, seeing that individual comrades in the army had poor discipline, complained about the army and forgot the bravery and heroic sacrifices of our army in battle. This is not good. In the past few days, everyone has done some propaganda and fundraising work, which is very good. We should continue to do this in the future and tell the masses the heroic stories of the army's fighting. More importantly, we should prepare sufficient material strength in the border areas and the rear, strengthen rear transportation, and do everything for the victory of the front line. Launch mass guerrilla warfare on the front lines, clear the fields, and avoid losses like those in Wenxi. We must also prepare immediately in the rear. We must understand that today's operations require annihilating the main force of the attackers, so we must not be concerned with the gains and losses of one time and one place. The enemy may arrive in some areas. For this reason, the rear must accelerate the thorough and unfettered mobilization of the masses, organize mass armed forces, and prevent assassinations and riots by secret agents. Seize, harvest, cultivate, and plant crops in order to race against time, prepare for war, and support the front line.

　　Recently, a very small number of comrades have shown indifference to the current situation, and individual comrades have even had family problems. Some demands were not wrong in themselves, but if we put our energy into these aspects and ignore the serious war and relax the urgent tasks, it would be wrong. It is even more wrong to feel depressed, emotionally disturbed, and blame everyone else as a result. Although hedonistic thoughts have been overcome, some comrades still have hedonistic pursuits. Such inappropriate demands exceeding financial strength (i.e., the strength of the people) should be thoroughly resolved ideologically. We must face the current situation, constantly see the people, and continue to conduct ideological self-criticism. Eight years of enemy and natural disasters, plus the disasters of the reactionaries' attacks and this summer's floods in the plains, next year will be very difficult. The Kuomintang will continue the civil war for a period of time, and the people's burden cannot be increased excessively. How can we overcome this difficulty while ensuring victory on the front line? The only way is to find more ways from everyone saving food and clothing and opposing waste.

　　Finally, I want to emphasize again that comrades should carefully study the editorial "Chiang Kai-shek's Army Will Be Defeated" and raise their fighting spirit. Be vigilant, recognize the basic policy of the Sino-US reactionaries to expand the Chinese civil war, and never become paralyzed or harbor illusions about peace. Although the future is bright and victorious, we must see the difficulties and vigorously overcome all thoughts that ignore the war situation and the difficulties. Remember well: Peace must be won by the power of the military and civilians in the liberated areas to strike down the reactionaries.

### 杨主席在边府干部会上的时事报告

　　杨主席在边府干部会上的时事报告
    我首先要提一个问题：大家是不是以为时局形势又可能缓和了呢？离前线远，很可能这样想；但实际恰好相反。现在是一个大的战斗过去，受严重打击的国民党反动派正在积极准备，军队调动频繁，在各战场上更剧烈的战斗即将到来。
    最近全国战况是这样：（一）华中战场：新四军粟裕所部七战七捷，在全国各解放区首屈一指，共已歼灭汤恩伯部六万人。计：一个师部（原军部），七个旅（原师改），五个连，一个交通总队（七个大队），收复重要村镇十九处。俘国民党九十九旅（原师改，下同）旅长、副旅长、参谋长，一八七旅正副旅长，二十六旅正副旅长，一○五旅副旅长，七旅副旅长等以下官兵三万五千余人。毙伤国民党四十九师副师长王克俊以下官兵二万余人。缴获甚多，计：野战炮三门，山炮十五门，九二式炮十二门，防空炮五门，旧防空炮二门，迫击炮七十四门，美造火箭炮三十门，掷弹筒二百二十六个，高射炮五门，重机枪一百三十四挺，轻机枪一千一百九十挺，手提机枪一百六十三挺，汤尼司机枪六百九十七挺，马克沁机枪二百零九挺，步枪九千二百六十枝，各种子弹炮弹二百多万发，装备了自己。报纸上不是载着“我们已有了美械师”吗！现在华中战事处于胶着状态，国民党正积极调动兵力中。（二）徐州方面：薛岳部三十五个旅向我进攻，已占去我宿迁雎宁淮阴等城，北进之敌止于台儿庄。因雨水太大，河水泛滥，活动不便，故我方主力部队不能进行大的反击。这一地区是全国战场中心，关系重大。（三）山东胶济沿线：王耀武的进攻部队计十五个旅，九月上旬为我消灭近两个旅。王部已侵占我高密、周村、张店、淄川、博平、临淄、章邱、邵平等十九个重要县镇，近我军先后收复济阳、桓台、广饶等三县城，战局正演变中。（四）大同地区：晋察冀、晋绥主力各一部，正在向顽伪攻我的中心据点大同作战，已经攻占大同北关飞机场与车站。傅作义调集全部兵力十一个团，占我卓资山，其暂三军（二个师）被我军全部歼灭，现正在集宁周围血战。（五）热河、冀东：国民党五个师（原军改）占我承德、赤峰、古北口、喜峰口、香河、迁安、乐亭等地。我军反击，已收复卢龙、倴城及都山。（六）五师地区：李先念将军所部，自中原突围后，已胜利的建立了两块根据地。一块是李先念将军直接领导的鄂豫陕根据地，分四个军分区。另一块是王树声将军所建立的鄂豫边根据地，也分四个军分区。现在是他们的大好开展时机，这正是国民党反动派所谓：“李先念部已不存在了”之实际的讽刺，人民队伍不可战胜之又一证明。（七）说到边区周围冀鲁豫方面：冀鲁豫已经成为全国主要战场之一了。继开始陇海获胜之后，最近我军又在冀鲁豫杀伤蒋军一万七千多人，歼灭其三师及四十七师全部，另四十一师受重创。蒋军对我冀鲁豫区进攻之东西两个钳子已打伤一个，白崇禧精心布置的阵势遭到严重打击。负责前线总指挥的刘峙已被免职，代之以顾祝同。现蒋介石、陈诚又亲自到新乡来布置，续调大军进攻，战事正在荷泽附近进行。蒋军越深入，越有利于我们之歼灭主力作战，大家必须认识今天作战不在一城一地之得失，而在歼灭其主力。大战即将展开，后方必须以千百倍的努力来支援。（八）太岳区：陈赓司令所部在消灭胡宗南一个旅后，挥戈北上，收复洪、赵、霍、灵、汾西等五县城，控制同蒲路二百八十余里。我区与晋绥吕梁军区已连成一片。现晋南胡宗南动员八个旅（原师改）沿同蒲北进，占我垣曲、绛县、翼城、闻喜等城。但因其兵力不足，战线漫长，陷于不利，不能大举深入，正拟再抽调陕南部队，投入同蒲线作战。大战正酝酿中。
    综合以上情况，并不是表示形势可能和缓，而是正在酝酿着新的更大规模的更剧烈的战斗。看反动派之积极布置，新的大战即将开始了。我们不应因胜而骄而忽，艰巨的任务还在前面。更千万不可看不到前面之剧烈斗争而麻痹起来，麻痹就必然斗志松懈，必然要吃亏。举一个例子来说，太岳区闻喜县损失公粮××石，这是很惨痛的教训。全国范围的激烈战斗马上将展开了！看报纸消息，蒋介石军在关内外，大河南北那处不是在积极调动与布置？大家不要幻想和平！要很好研究解放日报“蒋军必败”的社论，肃清对中美反动派的幻想和对和平能轻易到来的想法。
    我想关于五人会议的消息，可能对部分同志又引起一些幻想。如果这样，则对中美反动派和时局形势太缺乏研究了。事实证明，马歇尔实际是执行着援蒋反共的一面政策，已经不能再说他是两面政策了。美国帝国主义分子希望蒋介石为他作事，“害怕中国共产党如南斯拉夫或波兰共产党之得势”。所以不希望中国真正有民主和平。最近上海外国报纸公开问：“马歇尔究竟是调解中国内战？抑是指挥美蒋联军打共产党的总司令呢”？连外国人都这样提出问题了。一年来的事实教育我们，更深刻认识美国对中国的殖民地政策，和马歇尔调停之实质。马歇尔的尽心调停总是在我们打胜仗的时候，给蒋介石以重整队伍卷土重来的时间。当前我军大胜，马歇尔又提出召开五人会议，解决国府委员问题了。可是中共代表坚决主张的“达到协议后，即行发布全国停战令”的条件为蒋介石坚决拒绝，马歇尔却表示无能为力，是真的无能为力吗？有谁相信！谁也知道，没有美国支持，蒋介石是不敢如此猖狂无理的。所以五人会议即使开成，也不过是又一次的为蒋介石争取时间以期贯彻其消灭我们的方针而已。美国总统已经声明了援蒋政策不变，而且正在积极进行血腥交易。华莱士讲演事件，闹得多末滑稽有趣！美国民主人士之反对，声浪虽高，美国反动者犹在置若罔闻。由这些消息看，五人会议之召集，还有什么根据可以容许我们存在幻想呢？过去我们对和平估计太高，已经吃了亏，应该认识即使五人会开成，有了协议，也一样会成为拖延妙计，国民党仍然会随时破坏的。政协会的决议多么好，蒋介石的诺言又多么好听，不是已经全部撕毁了吗？这不是惨酷的教训吗？还对中美反动派存有幻想的同志们，要好好把过去与现在的事实想一想。只有在人民力量更加壮大，更严重的给美国支持下的中国反动派以粉碎性的打击，才会有比较真实的和平会议出现。但斗争还是不会停止的。
    关于同志们思想和工作任务问题，我还想再次谈谈。
    蒋军在冀鲁豫战线者，据我所闻，其企图是“歼灭刘伯承主力，拿下荷泽，进占濮阳，打通平汉路”。在冀鲁豫、苏北、鲁南地区，集中了五十旅（原师改）之兵力（总兵力的四分之一），现在主锋正向我区进攻。冀鲁豫的胜仗，关系全局，对我区关系尤大，时局万分紧张。据前方消息，士气旺盛，打碎进攻者有把握，只要我们前线后方一切政民能以最大力量，及时的支持前线。刘司令员、邓政委说：前线打胜仗是不成问题的，困难是后方运输太慢，弹药粮食兵员供给不上。这次作战我方亦有相当伤亡，我看了“大杨湖之战”的通讯，感动得流泪！前线将士如此前仆后继的英勇奋战，流血牺牲，用自己的肉体进行攻坚作战，我们在后方的同志们，以及全边区人民，应当如何安慰他们，尽自己的责任呢！过去有些同志看到军队个别同志纪律不好，就埋怨军队，忘记我们军队打仗的勇敢，英勇的牺牲，这是不好的。前几天大家作了些宣传募捐工作，很好，今后还要做，把军队的打仗英勇故事告诉群众。更重要的我们应在边沿区和后方准备充分的物质力量，加强后方运输，一切为着前线胜利。开展前线的群众游击战争，空室清野，避免如闻喜一样的损失，在后方也要即刻准备。必须明白今天作战要歼灭进攻者的主力，就须不计一时一地的得失，有些地区敌人可能到。为此，后方要加速的彻底放手发动群众，组织群众武装，防止特务的暗杀和暴动。抢收、抢耕、抢种，为力争时间，准备战争，支援前线。
    近来，极少数同志，还有对时局漠不关心的现象，个别同志还有闹家庭问题者，有些要求，原来并不错，但假使把精神放到这方面，而忽略了严重的战争，放松了迫急的任务，便不对了。因此而苦闷，而情绪不安，怨天尤人，更不对。享乐思想虽已有克服，但仍有些同志存在着享乐的追求思想，这样不适时超出财政力量（即人民力量）的要求，应彻底从思想上解决。要面对时局，时时看到老百姓，要继续作思想检查。八年敌灾天灾，加上反动派进攻的灾和今夏平原水灾，明年的时光将是很困难的。国民党继续内战，还要一个时期，人民负担又不能过分加重，我们怎样渡过这个困难，而又能保证前线胜利呢？只有从大家节衣缩食，反对浪费方面多想办法。
    最后，要加重提起同志注意，要详细研究“蒋军必败”这一篇社论，提高斗志。警惕起来，认识中美反动派扩大中国内战的基本方针，千万不要麻痹，千万不要幻想和平。前途虽是光明的，胜利的，但必须看到困难，大力克服各种忽视战局，忽视困难的思想。牢记住：和平要靠解放区军民打击反动派的力量来争取。
