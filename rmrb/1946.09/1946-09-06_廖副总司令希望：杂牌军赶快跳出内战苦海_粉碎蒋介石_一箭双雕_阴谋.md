　　Deputy Commander Liao Hopes:
    Irregular Troops Quickly Escape the Sea of Suffering of Civil War
    Shatter Chiang Kai-shek's "Killing Two Birds with One Stone" Conspiracy
    [This newspaper's dispatch on the 5th] At this moment when Chiang Kai-shek has provoked an all-out civil war, Democratic National Construction Army Deputy Commander Liao Anbang, Army Commander Qiao Mingli, and others, especially spoke to reporters. Deputy Commander Liao said: "I once wrote in my diary that whoever plays with civil war is committing suicide. Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the help of American imperialism to launch a civil war, will accelerate his demise. I hope that all irregular troops will quickly crawl out from under Chiang Kai-shek's 'killing two birds with one stone' conspiracy and no longer blindly follow him into the tomb of death." Army Commander Qiao Mingli was extremely resentful of the American imperialist elements helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. He said, "We resisted Japan so as not to be slaves of a defeated nation. If American imperialist elements treat China as their colony, we will not agree to it either." Division Commander Tian said in a heavy tone, "All the officers and soldiers of our division are very resentful of Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on civil war. Chiang Kai-shek should think about it, today the people's power is so strong, how can you eliminate it." Speaking of Chiang Kai-shek's exclusion of dissidents, he said, "Irregular troops are always put in the front to charge in battle, put in the front during the War of Resistance, and put in the front in the civil war, decreasing day by day. This is our past deep pain, and now we have gained survival and growth by standing in the embrace of the people." Deputy Division Commander Yan said: "I hope that friends in non-direct line troops will quickly withdraw from the civil war and stand together with the Chinese people." Sun Yuanru, head of the headquarters special service regiment, said: "Although Chiang Kai-shek has American weapons, he will inevitably fail. The five disagreements prevalent in the Kuomintang area—disagreement between the army and the people, disagreement between the army and the party, disagreement between the army and the government, disagreement between officers and soldiers, and disagreement between direct and irregular lines—explain the root cause of Chiang Kai-shek's failure."

　　廖副总司令希望：
    杂牌军赶快跳出内战苦海
    粉碎蒋介石“一箭双雕”阴谋
    【本报五日讯】当此蒋介石挑起全面内战之际，民主建国军廖安邦副总司令、乔明礼军长诸氏，特对记者发表谈话，廖副总司令称：“我过去在日记上曾这样写着，谁玩弄内战，谁就等于自杀。蒋介石依靠美帝的帮助发动内战，就要加速他的灭亡，我希望所有杂牌部队，从蒋介石‘一箭双雕’的阴谋下，赶快爬出来，不要再盲目的随他走到死亡的坟墓里。”乔明礼军长对美帝国主义分子帮助蒋介石打内战异常愤恨，他说：“我们抗战为了不当日寇亡国奴，美帝国主义分子把中国当他们的殖民地，我们同样不答应。”田师长以沉痛的声调说：“我们全师官兵对蒋介石坚持内战非常愤恨，蒋介石也不想一想，今天人民力量这样强大，你怎样能消灭。”谈到蒋介石排斥异己，他说：“杂牌部队，那次战斗也放在前头打冲锋，抗战放在前头，打内战也放在前头，一天比一天的减少，这是我们过去深切的痛苦，现在站在人民怀抱里来才得到生存壮大”。阎副师长谈：“我希望非嫡系部队朋友们，赶快退出内战，和中国人民站在一起。”总部特务团孙元儒团长说：“蒋介石虽有美式武器也必然失败，在国民党区流行的五不合，军民不合，军党不合，军政不合，官兵不合，嫡系和杂牌不合，就是说明蒋介石失败的病根”。（朱波）
