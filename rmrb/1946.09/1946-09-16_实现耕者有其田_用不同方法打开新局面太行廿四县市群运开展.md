　　Implementing "Land to the Tiller"
    Opening Up New Prospects with Different Methods - Mass Movement Launched in 24 Counties and Cities of the Taihang Region
    [Report from our Changzhi office, 11th] After the arrival of the land reform work teams in the new districts in mid-August, they actively led the masses to overturn their lives. Now, a thorough liquidation movement has been universally launched in various places. The situation in the new districts is rapidly opening up, while the old districts are becoming increasingly in-depth. This includes 24 counties and cities: Jingxing, Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, Xingtai, and Xingtai City in the First District; Pingding, Yuci, Xiyang, Heshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Changzhi, and Huguan in the Second District; Wu'an, Anyang, Tangyin, Jiqi, and Huixian in the Third District; and Lingchuan, Bo'ai, and Jiaozuo City in the Fourth District. Among them, Wu'an, Heshun, Anyang, and other places have truly achieved rapid, fierce, and thorough results. Pingding, Yuci, Tangyin, and other places on the periphery are also developing well. In the core area counties represented by Wu'an and Heshun, the first step was to implement inspections based on the standard of realizing "land to the tiller." From the inspection, it was further clarified that the local masses had not yet completely turned over, and the fruits of the previous struggle were unfairly distributed in most villages. The broad masses of middle peasants and some honest farmers had not been mobilized, and bad elements were in power in some villages, causing trouble. Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Neiqiu, Xingtai, Shahe, Heshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Wu'an, Anyang, and other counties first solved the above three problems, breaking through the movement. In the movement, attention was paid to combining ideological mobilization with current affairs education, and boldly letting activists lead the masses to turn the world upside down. At the same time, each county also paid attention to solving its own special problems. For example, Heshun and Wu'an overcame the complacency of cadres, Zuoquan and Anyang combined it well with production, Xiangyuan paid special attention to ideological mobilization, and Changzhi combined it with the unified progressive tax work, thus the movement progressed rapidly. Regarding the content of the liquidation, the rent and debt liquidation in Heshun, Wu'an, Anyang, and other places was relatively thorough last winter and this spring. At this time, the focus is on liquidating the feudal landlords' shifting of burdens and various accounts of blood and sweat labor. The movement is now generally moving in-depth. Gaoyi, Neiqiu, Xingtai, Shahe, Zuoquan, Lingchuan, and other counties are carrying out rent liquidation, debt liquidation, and asset liquidation in addition to liquidating the shifting of burdens. The movement is now unfolding fiercely in most areas. Jingxing, Yuanshi, Pingding, Yuci, Tangyin, and other peripheral areas have seized the characteristics of armed struggle. Supported by armed struggle, they have broken the masses' ideological concerns about "the sky changing" and launched a liquidation movement against traitors, special agents, and local bullies to settle blood debts.
    Although the movement in the entire region has made great progress in the past month, some shortcomings still exist: some counties still show the chronic disease of being slow and lagging behind the demands of the masses, while some counties have the acute disease of taking on everything and doing it for them. The landlord mentality and tired work style of some cadres are directly and indirectly hindering the development of the movement. The leadership has promptly raised these issues and called on cadres at all levels to boldly mobilize the masses and thoroughly implement the "land to the tiller" policy to achieve complete liberation.

　　实现耕者有其田
    用不同方法打开新局面太行廿四县市群运开展
    【本报长治十一日电】各地翻身队于上月中旬到达新区后，积极领导群众翻身，现各地已先后普遍掀起彻底清算运动，新区局面迅速打开老区则日益深入，计有：一分区之井陉、元氏、高邑、赞皇、内邱、邢台、邢市，二分区之平定、榆次、昔阳、和顺、左权、襄垣、长治、壶关，三分区之武安、安阳、汤阴、汲淇、辉县，四分区之陵川、博爱、焦作市等二十四个县市，其中武安、和顺、安阳等地真正做到迅速、猛烈、彻底，处于边沿区之平定、榆次、汤阴等地亦开展较好。以武安、和顺为代表的腹心区各县，首先是实行了以实现“耕者有其田”为标准的检查，从检查中更明确认识了当地群众还没有翻透身，前次斗争果实在大部村中分配不公，广大中农及部分老实农民没有发动起来及一些村子坏分子当权捣乱，高邑、赞皇、内邱、邢台、沙河、和顺、左权、襄垣、武安、安阳等县，首先解决以上三个问题突开了运动。在运动中注意思想发动和时事教育结合，并大胆放手让积极分子带领群众翻天覆地的去干。同时，各县又注意了解决本县的特殊问题，如和顺、武安等地克服了干部自满情绪，左权、安阳很好结合了生产，襄垣特别注意了思想发动，长治结合统累税工作进行，因而运动进展很快。在清算内容上，和顺、武安、安阳等地在去冬今春算租清债已较彻底，这时是清算封建地主转嫁负担和各种血汗劳役账，现运动一般已走向深入；高邑、内邱、邢台、沙河、左权、陵川等地县除了清算转嫁，还进行算租、清债、清资等，现运动大部在猛烈展开中。井陉、元氏、平定、榆次、汤阴等边沿地区，则抓紧了武装斗争的特点，由武装斗争撑腰作主，打破群众怕“变天”的思想顾虑，开展了反奸特反恶霸的清算血泪仇运动。
    月余来全区运动虽有很大开展，但尚存在某些缺点：有些县仍表现着慢腾腾的落于群众要求之后的慢性病，有些县则有在包办代替的急性病，部分干部的地主情绪，疲塌作风等等都在直接与间接的阻碍运动的发展，领导上已及时提出这些问题，号召各级干部，放手大胆的发动群众，贯彻翻身彻底实现“耕者有其田”。
