　　Cai Chang Calls on Women in Liberated Areas
    To Bring Proposals on Peace and Democracy to the International Women's Conference
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th】Cai Chang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China, recently sent a telegram to women's organizations in various liberated areas, calling on them to present the Chinese people's proposals for world peace and democracy to the International Women's Conference to be held in the United States. This conference was suggested by the Subcommittee on the Status of Women under the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and will be held in New York from October 13th to 23rd. Its purpose is to gather women leaders from various countries to exchange experiences to help realize the UN program. The four issues scheduled for discussion at the conference are: (1) What kind of political world do we live in? (2) What kind of economic world do we live in? (3) What kind of social order do we want to strive for? (4) What is the spiritual and moral situation of the real world? Cai Chang hopes that each liberated area will widely convene various discussion meetings based on the urban and rural conditions of the area, and make every effort to express the liberated area people's proposals for realizing lasting world peace and democracy. Various suggestions and proposals should be conveyed to our two women leaders, Soong Ching Ling and Deng Yingchao, through telegrams or letters from groups, individuals, or several people jointly, so that they can bring these opinions to the conference.
