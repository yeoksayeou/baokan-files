Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 20th: US News Service, Washington, September 18th: The Department of Commerce reports that in 1939, there were 3.3 million businesses of various industries in the United States. From the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident to 1943, the number of businesses fell by 16.5 percent. In the winter of 1943, this downward trend stopped. In December 1945, the number of all businesses in the United States was still 200,000 fewer than in 1941. In terms of employing workers, in 1939, 99 percent of manufacturing businesses employed less than 500 workers each. In 1941, businesses employing 500 or more workers accounted for only 2 percent. In the same year, large-scale manufacturing businesses employing more than 10,000 workers employed a total of 13 percent of all workers, which further increased to 31 percent in 1944. The above statistics show that the concentration of capital in the United States intensified during the war.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 20th: US News Service, Washington, September 18th: The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) recently published a document entitled "Economic Outlook," advocating that the United States should take four steps in order to "make full use of all its labor strength, utilize all production facilities, and achieve a larger and more even distribution of national income." The four steps listed in the report are: (1) more effectively implement our anti-trust laws; (2) provide economic and technical assistance to small businesses, including assistance in scientific research; (3) eliminate trust-like industrial alliances in national and international arenas; (4) universally use trademark rights. The report also approved the proposal made by Senator Morse (a more enlightened Republican from Oregon) to continue to oppose plans to concentrate wealth and power. The report quoted a recent report from the Senate Small Business Committee stating that the war strengthened the position of large enterprises, strengthened their control over the entire economy, and while the position of small enterprises became increasingly insignificant, monopolistic enterprises grew increasingly, and as large enterprises became larger, profits, asset surpluses, accumulated reserves, and dividend distributions were almost entirely concentrated in the hands of certain large American enterprises, and scientific and technological knowledge had almost become the exclusive property of large enterprises.

　　战争期间小企业衰微
    美国垄断资本发展
    产业工会提出补救方案
    【新华社延安二十日电】美新闻处华盛顿十八日电：商务部报告称：一九三九年美国国内各种工业之行号共有三百三十万家。从珍珠港事件爆发至一九四三年之间，行号数目跌至百分之十六点五，一九四三年冬季，此种低降之趋势中止。在一九四五年十二月，美国所有之行号仍较一九四一年减少廿万家。至于雇用工人方面，一九三九年制造业行号的百分之九十九，每家雇用职工不到五百人。一九四一年雇用工人五百人以上之行号仅占百分之二。同年雇用工人在万人以上的、规模宏大的制造业行号，其所雇用工人之总数，占全部工人百分之十三，至一九四四年更增至百分之三十一。上述统计，显示美国资本集中在战争中更加强了。
    【新华社延安二十日电】美新闻处华盛顿十八日讯：产业工会联合会最近发表一种文告，名为“经济前瞻”，主张美国应采取四项步骤，以便“尽量运用其全部劳工实力，利用一切生产之便利，并使全国收入能获致更大而更平均之分配”。报告中所列之四项步骤为：（一）更有效执行我们的反托拉斯法律；（二）对小企业实行经济与技术之援助，包括科学研究方面之协助；（三）由全国与国际场面中消灭类似托拉斯之工业同盟；（四）普遍使用商标权。该报告并核准参议员摩尔斯（俄勒冈州较开明之共和党员）所提之建议，继续反对集中财富与权力之计划。该报告引参院小型企业委员会最近报告称：战争使大企业加强其地位，加强其对整个经济之控制，同时当小企业之地位日益微小声中，垄断地位之企业公司亦随之日益长成，大企业规模愈益扩大，则利润与资产盈余积蓄与红利分发，几乎已完全集中于某些美国大企业公司之手，科学技术知识几已成为大企业之专有物。
