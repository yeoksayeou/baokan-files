[By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng, 8th] In Jincheng's Sixth District, at the recent rally against Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and launching a civil war, and to defend the motherland and the fruits of land reform, four hundred farmers voluntarily requested to enlist, including 239 militiamen, 43 members of the farmers' association, 44 village cadres, and 74 honorably discharged soldiers and primary school teachers. Liu Yushan, an honorably discharged soldier, said when applying to rejoin the army: "When I was discharged, I said: if the reactionaries attack us, I am willing to return to the army to be loyal to the motherland, and today is the time!" While many farmers were requesting to enlist, in a corner, Fan Shuanju and his fiancée were whispering to each other. His fiancée, Liang Xianxian, earnestly told him: "If you can't protect your hometown, you can't protect me. Go ahead with confidence, I will definitely take care of your mother-in-law." Liang Xianxian's spirit of "one for all" caused a sensation throughout Jincheng and was widely praised. Since this conference, the masses in 22 administrative villages in the district have enthusiastically engaged in supporting the front and rear service work, making great achievements in making military shoes, offering condolences, providing preferential treatment to families of soldiers, boiling saltpeter, and making sulfur.

[By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng, 8th] Three thousand farmers in Yangcheng, led by County Magistrate Zhang Tianyi, set off on the 2nd to support the Jinan self-defense front. The farmers in the rear, then, quickly and universally organized to step up autumn harvesting and planting preparations, so that the front and the rear are closely linked. In Xi Liqiu Village, all the farmers in the village organized eight mutual aid teams of men and women, totaling 221 people, at the farewell meeting for supporting the front. Han Shang Village organized 36 mutual aid teams, guaranteeing that all the crops of those supporting the front would be harvested. Among them, the women's mutual aid teams worked the fastest. Ma Qiugui's team of ten women harvested 18 mu of millet in one day yesterday, and Wang Qilin's team of twelve women harvested 19 mu, doubling the usual work efficiency. It is estimated that all the ripe millet in the village will be harvested within five days.
