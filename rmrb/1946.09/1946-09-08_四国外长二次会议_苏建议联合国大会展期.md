　　Second Four Foreign Ministers Conference
　　Soviet Union Suggests Postponing UN General Assembly
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th】Paris dispatch: At 4:00 PM on the 5th, the four foreign ministers held their second meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky attended on behalf of Molotov. The main topic of discussion was the postponement of the UN General Assembly, but no agreement was reached. At the meeting, Vyshinsky made the following suggestion: postpone the UN General Assembly until mid-November or the end of the month, to be held in Paris or Geneva. If the Paris Peace Conference has not concluded by then, it should be held concurrently with the UN General Assembly. When making the suggestion, Vyshinsky mentioned the letter from Dubac, Secretary of the Peace Conference, which suggested postponing the UN General Assembly and setting October 20 as the end date for the Peace Conference. Byrnes and Bevin opposed the postponement and holding it in Geneva. French Foreign Minister Bidault said: he would accept holding the UN General Assembly in Geneva, but regarding Vyshinsky's suggestion to postpone the UN General Assembly, he believed that it should be accepted only after consulting all member states of the Peace Conference and the UN General Assembly and obtaining the majority's agreement. US Secretary of State Byrnes and British Foreign Secretary Bevin supported Bidault's latter opinion. Vyshinsky then spoke, hoping that the four powers would accept the Soviet proposal to ensure the success of the common cause of the four powers through a unanimous decision. At this point, the four foreign ministers unanimously agreed to adjourn the meeting in understanding without making a decision, and unanimously agreed to invite Wang Shijie, representative of the Nationalist Government, and Spaak, representative of Belgium (Chairman of the First UN General Assembly), to attend the foreign ministers' meeting to discuss this issue. Further dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, who was originally scheduled to return to Paris on the 4th, has now postponed his trip. It is expected that Molotov will stay in Berlin to confer with Marshal Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet forces in Germany. Byrnes is scheduled to go to Stuttgart, Germany, on the 5th to meet with the leaders of the US occupation zone. It is reported that Byrnes has spoken with Truman twice in the past 24 hours.

　　四国外长二次会议
    苏建议联合国大会展期
    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎讯：五日下午四时，四外长在法外交部召开第二次会议，苏外次维辛斯基代表莫洛托夫出席会议，主要讨论联合国大会展期问题，未获协议。会上维辛斯基提出如下建议：将联合国大会延至十一月中旬或月底召开，地点应在巴黎或日内瓦举行，届时如果巴黎和会尚未结束，则与联合国大会同时举行。维氏在提出建议时，曾提及和会秘书杜巴克的信，该信建议联合国大会展期举行，并确定十月二十日为和会结束日期。贝纳斯与贝文反对延期及在日内瓦召开。法外长比道尔说：他将接受在日内瓦召开联合国大会，对维辛斯基推延联合国大会的建议，他认为须征询和会及联合国大会一切会员国及得到大多数同意后才可接受。美国务卿贝纳斯与英外相贝文支持比道尔后一见意。维辛斯基继起发言中，希望四强接受苏联建议，以一致意见保证四强共同事业的成功。至此，四外长一致同意会议应在谅解上而不作决定休会，并一致同意邀请国民党政府代表王世杰与比利时代表斯巴克（联合国第一届大会主席）出席讨论这一问题的外长会议。又讯：苏外长莫洛托夫原定四日返巴黎，现已展期，预料莫氏将在柏林逗留，以便与德境苏军指挥官索科洛夫斯基元帅会商。贝纳斯定五日赴德境斯图加特城晤美占领区首领，据悉贝氏在过去二十四小时内，已与杜鲁门通话两次。
