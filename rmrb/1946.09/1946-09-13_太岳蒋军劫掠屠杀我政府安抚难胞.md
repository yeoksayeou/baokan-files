[Ben Bao Yangcheng 9th dispatch] After Chiang's troops invaded Quwo and Yicheng, they looted and massacred wantonly, and the masses fled with the old and young. The Second Administrative Office has instructed the Quwo and Yicheng county governments to assign specialized cadres to organize refugee resettlement and relief committees. In addition to allocating 200 shi of grain for emergency relief, cotton and grain will also be lent to help people settle down and engage in production. The Hongdong Democratic Government, in order to relieve the poor refugees in the newly liberated areas, will also distribute 2,000 shi of wheat seized this time to the famine-stricken people in the new areas, and will also allocate another 1,000 shi of wheat to reward the masses and militiamen who have contributed to the war.
