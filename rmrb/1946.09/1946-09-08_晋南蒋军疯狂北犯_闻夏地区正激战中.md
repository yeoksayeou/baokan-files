[This dispatch comes from] The Datong-Pukou Front, 5th of this month: Jiang Jieshi's Hu Zongnan's troops continue to expand their occupied area in southern Shanxi and are frantically invading north along the Datong-Pukou Railway. At the end of last month, Jiang's troops invading our Zhongtiao Mountain area were defeated and fled to Wenxi and Xiaxian. They then gathered more than 3,000 troops and began to invade again on the 1st. One route is currently being blocked by our defending troops at Tangwang Mountain, 60 miles southeast of Wenxi; another route is being blocked at Sijiao Huojian Pass, 50 miles east of Xiaxian; and another route is being blocked at Han Family Ridge, where fierce fighting is currently underway. The First Division of Jiang's troops (formerly a military unit that has been reorganized) invading north along the Datong-Pukou Railway, in coordination with Yan Xishan's puppet troops in Quwo, launched a large-scale invasion of our Qu(wo)-Yi(cheng) area on the 2nd. One route advanced north from Quwo city and captured our Qu Village and Xia Yan towns on the same night, reaching Jibi and Wangbi, northwest of Yicheng, on the 4th. Another route advanced along the Quwo-Yicheng highway and captured our Qingang town on the evening of the 2nd, and continued to attack our Yicheng fiercely at dawn on the 4th. At twelve noon on the same day, Yicheng was occupied by Jiang's troops. At the same time, Jiang's troops stationed in our Houma frantically invaded north along the railway line and captured our Gaoxian and Mengcheng towns on the 2nd. After Jiang's troops invaded the above-mentioned areas, their forces became more and more scattered, and they will inevitably fall into the great fire of our broad masses' guerrilla warfare and will be annihilated piecemeal by our main forces' maneuvering.

　　晋南蒋军疯狂北犯
    闻夏地区正激战中
    【本报同蒲前线五日电】蒋军胡宗南部队继续在晋南扩张面的占领，并沿同蒲路疯狂北犯。上月底进犯我中条山地区蒋军受挫，溃窜闻喜夏县后，复抽集兵力三千余于一日开始再度进犯，其一路现被我守军阻击于闻喜东南六十里之唐王山，一路被阻于夏县以东五十里之四交火涧口一带；另一路被阻于韩家岭，现正激战中。沿同蒲线北犯之蒋军第一师（原军改称）与曲沃阎伪军配合，二日向我曲（沃）翼（城）地区大举进犯，一路自曲沃城向北，当日晚陷我曲村、下堰两镇，四日进至翼城西北之吉壁、王壁，另一路沿曲翼公路向前推进，二日晚陷我秦岗镇，四日拂晓继续向我翼城猛扑，当天正午十二时翼城遂为蒋军占领。与此同时，占驻我候马，蒋军沿铁路线疯狂北犯，二日陷我高显、蒙城镇。蒋军入侵以上各地后，其兵力愈益分散，必将陷入我广大群众游击战的大火中，将为我主力部队机动的予以各个歼灭。
