[This dispatch from Changzhi] Huixian County has found a preliminary solution to the problem of financial difficulties faced by the families of cadres in county-level agencies. The decision was made that cadres should submit their family production plans, which would then be evaluated by all cadres in the agency to determine the number of laborers needed for the year. After approval by the county, "Assistant Worker Certificates" would be issued. Family members could use these certificates to request labor from the village. The village and the county would settle the accounts to cover the difference. Cadres in various agencies must take care of the families of cadres working away from home in the districts and villages. At the same time, cadres must educate their families to be kind and considerate to the villagers. The county treasury has also decided to loan 10,000 yuan to help cadres establish their households.
