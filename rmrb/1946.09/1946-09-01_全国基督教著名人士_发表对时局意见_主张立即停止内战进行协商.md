　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th. Prominent figures in national Christianity, including Tiao Hsin-teh, recently jointly issued opinions on the current situation, expressing their firm opposition to the civil war and their willingness to unite with all compatriots who abhor the civil war to strive for domestic peace and democracy. Tiao and others pointed out: "After eight years of war against Japan and amidst widespread disasters, China's situation has reached a point of exhaustion, with the people living in misery and unable to withstand more war. Moreover, if the war spreads, it may provoke international intervention and become the trigger for a third world war." Tiao and others stated: "We demand basic freedoms for the people and convenience in religion, belief, worship, and propaganda. All laws, orders, political measures, violence, and terror that contradict these, regardless of the region, should be abolished to provide legal guarantees for the people." Tiao and others called for a thorough reform of the current political situation, pointing out: "The corruption, decay, and laxity in officialdom are now undeniable facts. Especially in the recovered areas after the victory, they have turned the eager expectations of the people into pessimism due to disappointment, shifting from positive to negative attitudes. The current soaring cost of living, dilapidated transportation, the monopoly of bureaucratic capital, and the stagnation of industry and commerce are pushing the national economy and people's livelihoods to the brink of collapse." Tiao and others appealed: For the sake of getting to the root of the problem, we should immediately stop the civil war and conduct peaceful negotiations; restore transportation, reorganize the army, convene a National Assembly, formulate a constitution, implement popular elections, and reorganize the government. Those who signed the same statement of opinion included Tiao Hsin-teh, Acting President of St. John's University in Shanghai; Li Pei-en, President of Zhijiang University; Wu Gaozi, Deputy General Secretary of the National Christian Council of China; Shao Linsan, General Secretary of the Church of Christ in China; Lin Jingrun, President of Renhe University; Xu Yuqing, Associate Secretary of the National YMCA of China; Liang Xiaochu, General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese YMCA; Cui Xiansheng, Secretary of the National Council of the Church of Christ in China; Cai Kui, General Secretary of the National YWCA of China; and Zheng Hefu, Bishop of the Chinese Anglican Church.

　　全国基督教著名人士
    发表对时局意见
    主张立即停止内战进行协商
    【新华社南京二十九日电】全国基督教著名人士刁信德等于日前联名发表对时局的意见，表示坚决反对内战，愿和全国所有厌恶内战的同胞团结起来，争取国内的和平与民主。刁氏等指出：“经过八年抗战和在遍地灾荒中，中国的局面已到了山穷水尽，民不聊生的地步，不堪再有战争。况且万一战事蔓延，恐将引起国际的干涉，而为第三次世界大战的导火线。”刁氏等称：“我们要求人民的基本自由和宗教、信仰、崇拜、宣传的便利，无论任何地区，凡此相间驰的法律命令、政治措施、暴力、恐怖都应一律取消，使人民得到合法的保障。”刁氏等要求彻底改革目前的政治，指出：“现在官场中的贪污腐败，松懈无力，已成为不可讳言的事实。尤其是在胜利后的收复区，已经使殷殷盼治的民心因失望而悲观，转积极为消极。当前生活指数的高涨，交通工具的窳陋，官僚资本的垄断，工业商务的不振，将使全国经济民生濒于绝境。”刁氏等呼吁：为正本清源计，应当立即停止内战，进行和平协商；并恢复交通，整编军队，召开国民大会，制定宪法，实行民选，改组政府。署名于同一意见书者，有上海圣约翰大学代理校长刁信德、之江大学校长李培恩、中华全国基督教协进会副总干事吴高梓、中华基督教会总干事邵邻三、仁和大学校长林景润、中华基督教青年会副干事徐羽卿、中华基督教青年全国协会总干事梁小初、中华基督教会全国总会卿干事崔宪声、中华基督教女青年会全国协会总干事蔡葵、中华圣公会主教郑和甫等。
