　　Cultural Briefs
    A literary and art work symposium convened by the Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department was held at the Handan Municipal People's Education Hall a few days ago. Members of the Peking University Overturning Drama Troupe shared many insights from going to the countryside. Performances of "The White Haired Girl" not only educated the masses but also educated themselves. They all said, "After performing 'The White Haired Girl' in Xingtai, Nanhe, and other places, seeing the impact it had on the masses and the promotion of the masses' emancipation movement, we began to realize the importance of theatrical work." In the end, Director Ren of the Propaganda Department encouraged everyone to work hard in theatrical work, cooperate with the political struggle, and complete the tasks of propaganda work, and to go deep among the masses and learn from the masses.
