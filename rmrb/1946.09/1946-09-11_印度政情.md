　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Comprehensive report on the Indian political situation: The upper echelon of the Congress Party compromised with the British authorities, forming an interim government headed by the British Viceroy Wavell as Prime Minister and Congress leader Nehru as Deputy Prime Minister. Since then, the relationship between the Congress Party and the Muslim League has been on the verge of collapse, with continuous bloodshed.

　　When the interim government was sworn in in New Delhi on the 2nd, the Muslim League and its supporters held a black flag parade and demonstration in front of the government building to oppose the interim government. British military police intervened, resulting in a struggle with many casualties on both sides, and eighty demonstrators were arrested. In areas where Congress and Muslims live together, such as Lahore, bloody clashes also occurred, with hundreds of casualties on both sides. In Bombay, when the Congress Party and the Muslim League's demonstration teams met on the 2nd, a fierce fight broke out, resulting in hundreds of casualties on the spot. British military police then opened fire on Muslim League masses, killing and arresting hundreds of Muslim League masses on the spot, further aggravating the situation and developing into three days of continuous street fighting. By the 5th, a large number of British troops went to suppress the situation. The Muslim League retreated due to the disparity in strength, disintegrated into smaller units, and mobilized at night around Congress Party residential areas and British military camp areas, engaging in guerrilla warfare. Although the port is now guarded by British troops with sentries and tank patrols, the Muslim League is still continuing its struggle.

　　Suhrawardy, one of the leaders of the Muslim League and the Prime Minister of Bengal Province, made an important statement on the 6th, saying: "Our prospects are terrible. In the Indo-Muslim struggle that is sweeping across India, no one has thought of any degree of joy." Suhrawardy continued: "The Muslim League only hopes that it will still be possible to be given an equal position in the interim government based on the British mission's proposal." He also said: "I believe that Jinnah and the Muslim League, for the sake of peace in India, would be willing to participate in the interim government." Finally, Suhrawardy said: "Congress is intoxicated with power, and they do not understand that this is merely a very pitiful gift from the British. The intention of the British in giving this to Congress is to use it to divert attention and to create a permanent rift between Muslims and Hindus."

　　In response to this situation, Congress Party leader Nehru, after taking office as Deputy Prime Minister, met with reporters on the 4th and said: "The government we have formed does not only represent a section of the people, but represents all the people." He also said: "Regarding the relationship with Britain, the British are only temporarily residing in India. We welcome the British to reside here, but Indian affairs must be handled by the local Indians." Nehru's remarks will cause dissatisfaction among Indian nationalists, who believe that Nehru is satisfied with India becoming a British dominion. Nationalists have proposed expanding the base of the central government to become a coalition government of all Indian parties, taking care of the Muslim League's demands for autonomy, and taking correct steps to resolve it rationally. However, when the interim government held its first government affairs meeting the day before yesterday, it did not mention this, only discussing the abolition of the salt tax, but it was not finally decided due to concerns about affecting government revenue. In addition, on the 4th, it approved a loan of 70 million rupees (equivalent to 3.75 million pounds) to the UK for a period of 20 years. During this 20-year period, the UK will treat India as the most-favored nation in foreign trade. This move will be beneficial to British merchants in India.

### 印度政情

　　印度政情
    【新华社延安七日电】印度政情综合报导：国大党上层集团与英国当局妥协，成立以英督魏菲尔为总理以国大领袖尼赫鲁为副总理的临时政府，此后国大党与回教同盟间的关系即濒于破裂，并不断发生流血事件。
    当临时政府于二日在新德里宣誓就职时，回盟与其拥护者在政府门前举行黑旗游行示威，反对临时政府，英国军警出而干涉，发生格斗，双方死伤多人，有八十名示威者被捕。而在国回杂居地区拉合尔等地，亦发生流血格斗，双方伤亡数百人。在孟买，二日国大党与回盟的示威队伍相遇时，亦发生激烈格斗，当场即有数百名伤亡。英国军警则对回盟群众鸣枪射杀，当场又逮捕回盟数百群众，使事态益加严重，而演成持续三天的巷战。到五日，大批英军前去弹压，回盟因力量悬殊即行退却，化整为零，于夜间出动于国大党住区附近与英军营盘周围，实行游击。现该埠虽由英军驻守，并布岗放哨，坦克巡逻，但回盟仍在继续斗争中。
    回盟领袖之一、孟加拉省总理苏赫拉瓦狄于六日发表重要谈话称：“我们的前景是可怖的，在遍及印度各地的印回斗争中，谁还没想到有任何程度的喜悦。”苏氏继称：“回盟只希望仍有可能在英国使团之提议为基础的临时政府中，被给予平等的地位。”并说：“我相信金纳和回盟为了印度和平起见，会愿意参加临时政府的。”最后苏氏说：“国大是因权力而沉醉了，他们不了解这仅仅是英国非常可怜的礼物。英国给国大的用意是想用他迷惑注意力，而且在回教与印度教之间制造永久的裂隙。”
    对此种形势，国大党领袖尼赫鲁在就任副总理后，于四日接见记者时称：“吾人组织之政府，非仅代表部分人民，而系全体人民之代表者。”并谓：“关于与英国之关系，英国人在印度居留乃暂时情形，吾人欢迎英人居留此间，惟印度事务必须由当地之印人处理。”尼赫鲁此一谈话，会引起印度民族主义者的不满，民族主义者并认为尼氏满足印度成为英国自治领地位，民族主义者曾提出要求扩大中央政府的基础，成为印度各党派的联合政府，对回盟的自治要求应予照顾，并采取正确步骤合理解决之。然临时政府在前日举行首次政务会议时，对此并未提及，只讨论取销食盐税，而又恐影响政府岁收未最后决定。此外并于四日批准对英贷款七千万卢比（合三百七十五万英镑），为期二十年，英国在此二十年期间对外贸易时，以印度为最惠国。此举当对在印英商有利。
