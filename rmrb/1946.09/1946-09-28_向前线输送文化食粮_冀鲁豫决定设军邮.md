    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan] On September 3rd, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regional Party Committee convened a propaganda and education meeting. Attendees from the military included Comrade Wu Wen, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department, and Comrade Hu Chi, Director of the Zhan You Bao (Comrades-in-Arms Newspaper) of the Military Region Political Department. The meeting specifically addressed the issue of transporting newspapers and propaganda materials. It was decided that the post office would dispatch ten couriers (with two vehicles and two horses) to various units to establish a military postal service, under the leadership of the political departments of various units, specifically responsible for transporting newspapers, propaganda materials, and documents. They were required to reach the units within three days. Additional services were also added to the main lines of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth sub-districts to ensure that documents, newspapers, and propaganda materials were distributed immediately upon arrival. After this meeting, the transportation of publications such as the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily, Zhan You Bao, Zheng Gong Wang Lai (Political Work Exchanges), and other propaganda materials to the front-line troops, as well as the transportation of news articles, documents, mimeographed newspapers, circulars, materials, and captured documents from the front-line troops to higher-level political and military organs, became more convenient.
