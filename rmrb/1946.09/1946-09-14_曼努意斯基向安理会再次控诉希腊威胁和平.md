　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: According to Reuters, New York: The Security Council listened again on the evening of the 10th to a statement by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky, responding to statements by the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Greece at the two Security Council meetings on the 5th and 9th regarding his statement at the meeting on the 4th. Manuilsky responded to the Greek representative's point that the terror in Greece should be blamed on the Communists, saying: Now that people know what the Communists did in the resistance movement, it is time to stop calling them Communist bandits. When British and Australian representatives asked why the Soviet Union did not supervise the Greek elections, Manuilsky said: Because the Soviet Union believes this is an act of interference in other countries' internal affairs. Replying to the Australian representative's accusation that Ukraine's accusations against Greece were merely propaganda, Manuilsky declared: Those countries that attack Soviet propaganda have discovered the most ridiculous and absurd anti-Soviet propaganda. Manuilsky further stated: All bankrupt governments expose their weaknesses through anti-Soviet propaganda. Manuilsky finally reiterated his request that the Security Council take steps to promptly address the Greek-Albanian border incidents that threaten international peace. Furthermore, at the Security Council meeting on the 9th, despite the opposition of the British representative, the Albanian representative, Gakova, was invited to attend and testify. The Albanian representative condemned the Greek government for violating Albanian borders more than 120 times and denied the Greek government's claim that Albania and Greece were at war. The Albanian representative supported Ukraine's accusations and declared: "Anyone who violates Albanian borders will cause bloodshed, this is our clear statement." At that day's meeting, representatives from the United States and Australia, under the guise of "unreliable and untrustworthy" materials and minor facts, denied Ukraine's accusations. The US representative even openly defended the British troops stationed in Greece, going so far as to say that "the British troops stationed in Greece are a factor in stabilizing the situation." The Australian representative requested that the Security Council remove Ukraine's accusations from the agenda.

　　曼努意斯基向安理会再次控诉希腊威胁和平
    【新华社延安十一日电】据路透社纽约讯：安理会十日晚再次听取乌克兰外长曼努意斯基的声明，答复五日和九日安理会两次会议上英美澳希四国代表对其于四日会议上之声明的发言。曼氏答复希腊代表所谓希腊的恐怖应由共产党负责一点称：人们知道共产党在抵抗运动中做过一分事情以后，现在是应该停止叫他们做共产党强盗的时候了。英澳代表曾问苏联为何不去监督希腊选举，曼氏称：因为苏联认为这是一种干涉他国内政的行为。回答澳洲代表的谴责说：乌克兰的对希控诉只是一种宣传作用时，曼氏宣称：那些攻击苏联宣传的国家，发现了最滑稽无聊的反苏宣传。曼氏并称：所有破产的政府，都因为反苏宣传而暴露了他们的弱点。曼氏最后再次要求安理会采取步骤，迅速处理威胁国际和平的希阿边境事件。又安理会九日会议，曾不顾英国代表之反对邀请阿尔巴尼亚代表加可瓦出席作证，阿代表谴责希腊政府侵犯阿国边界达一百二十余次，并否认希腊政府所谓阿国与希腊处于战争状态之说。阿代表支持乌克兰之控诉，宣称：“谁要侵扰阿国边境，则将引起流血事件，这是我们明确的声明”。是日会议上，美澳两国代表发言时，则在材料“不确实不足信”和事实微小等辞令的掩盖下，否认乌克兰之控诉。美代表并公开替英军驻希作辩护，竟称“英军驻留希腊，为一稳定局势之因素”。澳洲代表则要求安理会自议程上取消乌克兰之控诉。
