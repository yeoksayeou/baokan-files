[This report from our newspaper's correspondent in Handan on the 11th:] Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who attacked our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area, have suffered a disastrous defeat in the indignant self-defensive counterattack of the military and civilians of the entire region. A Xinhua News Agency reporter summarized the two-month self-defense counterattack of the military and civilians of the entire region and its glorious achievements, stating: Since the beginning of July, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have launched large-scale offensives against our southern Shanxi and eastern Henan areas. In the southern Shanxi area, the Chiang-Yan allied forces concentrated eight divisions to invade and occupy over 200 important towns and cities, including Wenxi, attempting to seize the Tongpu Railway controlled by the Eighth Route Army in one fell swoop and sever our Shanxi Liberated Area. In the eastern Henan area, the Chiang-puppet troops carried out repeated encirclements and suppressions, attempting to completely destroy the eastern Henan Liberated Area and then advance towards our Liberated Areas on both sides of the Longhai Railway. Our military and civilians of the entire region could no longer tolerate this and were forced to rise up in self-defense. Around July 15th, they successively annihilated most of the 31st Division of Chiang's army, which had invaded southern Shanxi, as well as parts of the 167th and 78th Divisions, totaling about one division's strength. After mid-August, our army launched a powerful counterattack against Yan Xishan's troops in the central section of the Tongpu Railway, who were coordinating with Chiang's army's offensive in southern Shanxi, and successively liberated five county towns, including Hongdong, Zhao City, Huo County, Lingshi, and Fenxi, annihilating parts of Yan's 69th, 44th, and 39th Divisions, totaling about two divisions' strength. Chiang and Yan's attempt to connect the Tongpu Railway and sever our Liberated Area was ultimately thwarted, and our army controlled 270 li of the Tongpu Railway. On the Longhai front, our army began to counterattack the invading Chiang's army on August 10th, successively liberating seven county towns, including Lanfeng, Dangshan, Qi County, Tongxu, Yucheng, Taikang, and Huaiyang, as well as twelve stations along the Longhai Railway, including Luowang and Neihuang, controlling over 380 li of railway. The invading Chiang's army suffered approximately two divisions worth of casualties including the entire 181st Division, and parts of the 29th, 143rd, 81st, and 74th Divisions were annihilated by us. Five security regiments from Lanfeng, Dangshan, and Qi County, among other places, also suffered pointless losses. During this period, our army also liberated Qin County, annihilated the puppet troops entrenched outside Gaotang City and parts of the Chiang-puppet forces in Meng County, and liberated the vast number of people who had been ravaged. The war-weary Kuomintang troops also staged uprisings one after another. In August, four companies and two platoons of the 177th Brigade of the Kuomintang 38th Army stationed in Huixian, northern Henan, revolted. However, Chiang Kai-shek's warmongering clique did not show any remorse in the face of the people's heavy punishment. They regrouped their forces and launched another offensive against us at the end of August, successively invading Yuanqu, Jiang County, and Yicheng in southern Shanxi, as well as Lanfeng, Dangshan, Yucheng, Fengxian, Peixian, Cao County, Shan County, Yutai, and Chengwu along the Longhai Railway. They also concentrated over six armies, totaling more than eleven divisions, to attack Heze, the central area of our Ji-Lu-Yu region. We resolutely launched a self-defensive counterattack east of Kaocheng, completely annihilating the invading Chiang's army's 10th Army (Chiang's direct line, recently reorganized into the 3rd Division), one division of the 47th Army, and one division of the 41st Army, totaling four divisions. Liu Ruming's troops also suffered heavy losses, and Dongming, which had been occupied by Chiang's army, was immediately recovered by us. In these two months, the Chiang-Yan-puppet troops annihilated by us amounted to ten divisions. Approximately 60,000 soldiers, including commanders and below, laid down their arms or made pointless sacrifices. According to incomplete statistics (excluding the victory in Dongming), our army captured 14 mountain guns (including 6 American-made mountain guns), 311 other types of guns, 200 heavy machine guns, over 1,000 light machine guns, and over 10,000 rifles. We liberated 13 county towns and controlled over 800 li of railways (of which over 300 li were reoccupied by Chiang's army). The reporter then pointed out that the acquisition of these brilliant achievements fully proves that the treasonous civil war waged by Chiang Kai-shek's warmongering clique, relying on American imperialism, will be crushed by the patriotic self-defense war of the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas. In a short period or at a certain point, Chiang's army may concentrate superior forces to invade and occupy some towns and cities in the Liberated Areas, but the facts of past events prove that after Chiang's army's living forces are annihilated, the vast towns and cities still belong to the people of the Liberated Areas. In particular, the people in the areas occupied by Chiang's army have extensively launched a vigorous self-defense guerrilla war, attacking and eliminating the enemy everywhere, making Chiang's army restless and their morale declining, all of which have become insurmountable weaknesses in Chiang Kai-shek's civil war failure. Although this is the case, Chiang Kai-shek's warmongering clique, obsessed with dictatorship, has not abandoned its ambition to launch a civil war offensive. He will concentrate even greater forces to continue attacking us. Therefore, the military and civilians of our entire region must continue to promote the heroic spirit of past patriotic self-defense operations, and the rear must fully support the front, creating a vigorous patriotic self-defense movement throughout the region. Then we can expect that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war offensive, like in the past, will be crushed by the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas striving for independence, peace, and democracy.

　　全区军民两月自卫伟大胜利
    共歼蒋阎伪军十个师
    缴山炮十四门轻重机枪千二百余挺解放县城十三座控制铁路八百余里
    【本报邯郸十一日电】向我晋冀鲁豫解放区进攻的蒋介石军，在全区军民的悲愤自卫反击下，已遭受惨重失败。新华社记者总结两月全区军民自卫反击经过及辉煌战果称：七月初旬以来，蒋介石军即向我晋南、豫东地区实行大规模的进攻。在晋南区，蒋阎联军集中八个师的兵力，侵占我闻喜等重要城镇二百余处，企图一举夺取八路军控制下的同蒲路，割裂我山西解放区。在豫东地区，蒋伪军更进行反复围剿，企图彻底摧毁豫东解放区，并进而向我陇海两侧解放区进攻。我全区军民忍无可忍，乃被迫起而自卫，于七月十五日前后，相继歼灭侵入晋南蒋军卅一师大部，一六七师、七十八师各一部，共约一个师的兵力。八月中旬以后，我军更对配合晋南蒋军进攻的同蒲中段阎锡山军，实行有力反击，先后解放洪洞、赵城、霍县、灵石、汾西等五个县城，歼灭阎军六十九师、四十四师、三十九师各一部，共约两师兵力。蒋阎军贯通同蒲，割裂我解放区的企图终被粉碎，我军控制同蒲线达二百七十里。在陇海方面，我军于八月十日开始予进犯蒋军以反击，先后解放兰封、砀山、杞县、通许、虞城、太康、淮阳等七个县城及陇海路罗王、内黄等十二个车站，控制铁路三百八十余里。进犯蒋军一八一师全部、二十九师、一百四十三师、八十一师、七十四师各一部约两师之众为我歼灭，兰封、砀山、杞县等五个保安团等亦遭无谓牺牲。在此期间，我军并解放了沁县城，歼灭了盘踞高唐城外的伪军与孟县一部蒋伪军武装，解放了广大被蹂躏的人民。厌战的国民党军，此时亦纷纷起义，驻豫北辉县的国民党三十八军一七七旅，八月内先后四个连又两个排起义。但蒋介石好战集团，并未在人民的重大惩罚面前表现悔悟，仍重新调集兵力，于八月底再度向我进攻，先后侵陷晋南垣曲、绛县、翼城，陇海线的兰封、砀山、虞城、丰县、沛县、曹县、单县、鱼台、城武等地，并集中六个军十一个师以上的兵力，向我冀鲁豫中心区荷泽进攻，我乃坚决自了反击于考城以东地区，将进犯之蒋军第十军（蒋嫡系近改编为第三师）、四十七军一个师、四十一军一个师共四师之众全部歼灭，刘汝明部亦损失惨重，蒋军侵占的东明，当即为我收复。此两月中，蒋阎伪军被我歼灭者，已达十师之众，军长以下放下武器或作无谓牺牲者约六万人。据不完全统计，我军缴获（东明胜利未算在内）山炮十四门（内美式山炮六门），其他各型炮三百一十一门，重机枪二百挺，轻机枪一千余挺，步枪万余支。解放县城十三座，控制铁路八百余里（内三百余里复被蒋军占去）。记者继即指出这些辉煌成绩的获得，充分证明了蒋介石好战集团依靠美帝国主义所进行的卖国内战，是会被解放区军民的爱国自卫战争所粉碎的。在一个短时期内或某一点上，蒋军集中优势兵力可能侵占解放区一些城镇，但历次的事实证明：当蒋军有生力量被歼灭后，广大的城镇仍然是属于解放区人民的，特别是蒋军侵占区的人民，广泛展开了如火如荼的自卫游击战争，到处打击敌人，消灭敌人，使蒋军坐卧不安，士气日趋低落，这些都成了蒋介石内战失败的不可克服的弱点。虽然这样，但醉心独裁的蒋介石好战集团，内战进攻的野心并未破灭，他将集中更大的兵力，向我继续进攻。因此，我全区军民，必须继续发扬历次的爱国自卫作战的英勇精神，后方全力支援前线，造成全区一个热火朝天的爱国自卫运动。那么我们可以预期，蒋介石的内战进攻将和过去一样，要为解放区争取独立和平民主事业的军民所粉碎。
