　　Shi Zhuang Reactionary Puppets Arrange Grain Seizure
　　[This newspaper’s Changzhi 16th dispatch] The Jiang puppet troops in Shijiazhuang have been harassing our Taihang border areas for days, looting grain on a large scale. According to reliable information, a certain important person from the Kuomintang arrived in Shijiazhuang from Nanjing, personally supervising the Jiang puppet troops to seize grain, stipulating that 80% of the original planned looting must be completed before the autumn harvest. It is understood that the original planned wheat seizure in Yuanshi County alone reached 1.8 million jin, but only 40,000 jin had been completed by the beginning of this month. In order to continue to strengthen the encroachment and grain seizure of the liberated areas, the Jiang puppet troops are actively rushing to repair the highway from the Beisucun stronghold to Yuanshi County, and have appointed the puppet military leader Hou Ruyong as the "Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in the Eleven Counties of Western Hebei" south of Shijiazhuang. The military and civilians in the area are now actively hiding grain and preparing for war, and have loudly put forward the slogan "Defend the autumn harvest, and don't let the Jiang reactionary puppet troops seize a single grain of food."
