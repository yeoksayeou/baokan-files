The original text is as follows: Yan'an Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, esteemed sirs: Since our army arrived in the border area, we have received cordial care and strong assistance from all parties. The establishment was completed at the military headquarters in Handan on Shen Yuan. We are now sworn in. From now on, we pledge to always work closely with the border area's soldiers and civilians for the people's cause. We request instructions to be issued and followed. We extend our highest respects on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the army, and wish you good health! Sincerely,

    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 22nd Dispatch] General Gao Shuxun sent a telegram congratulating the 38th Army's Commanders Kong and Liu, stating: To the 38th Army Commander Kong, Deputy Commander Liu, and all officers and soldiers of the 38th Army: We are extremely happy to hear of the establishment of your esteemed army. Your army is the armed force of the Northwestern people and has a glorious revolutionary tradition. This time, you refused the rebellious orders and revolted in northern Henan, finally achieving reunification in the Liberated Area, which is a joy for the Chinese people. The future is long. We are willing to work together and advance shoulder to shoulder to achieve independence, peace, and democracy. Due to busy schedule, I am unable to personally offer congratulations. I am sending a telegram to express my condolences. I hope you will take note of this!
