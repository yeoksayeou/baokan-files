　　Anyang Militia Organizes Home Defense and Joint Self-Defense
    Striking Against Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops Achieves Remarkable Results
    Taihang Military Committee Issues Commendation
    Yuanshi Militia Captures Eight Armed Secret Agents Who Infiltrated Deep into the Mountains
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi, 17th] The Taihang Military Committee has issued a special commendation to the Anyang militia. After Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops occupied our Qugou and other areas, the militia of the occupied villages withdrew from their villages and formed a joint home defense with the surrounding village militias to launch guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The militia of the first district formed a flying demolition team, and the militias of the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts also formed small guerrilla units. Under the leadership of District Chief Yao Zhen, District Military Committee Director Yang Dianwen, Political Commissar Du Jinzhi, and other comrades, they carried out bombings, sieges, night raids, and took the initiative to attack. In the five days of late August, they fought more than 20 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. Militia hero Wang Rongqing bravely rushed into the village when attacking Dongzhangzhuang, striking against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, crushing their ferocity, and trapping them, rendering their insidious plot of nibbling away ineffective. This heroic self-defense action is worthy of emulation by the militias of the entire region.
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi, 17th] On the 29th of last month, our Yuanshi militia annihilated a small group of armed special agents who were hiding in our liberated area and disturbing the local area. This matter deserves serious vigilance from the military and civilians of our region. This group of special agents was hidden in a dilapidated temple on Fenglong Mountain, at the junction of Yuanshi and Huolu counties. At night, they came out to harass our Yuansuzhuang, Niujiazhuang, Shibangou, Xianwengzhai, and other places. On that day, they were discovered by our farmers planting mountain land, who immediately led the militia to surround the mountain. Because the special agents were active at night and slept during the day, they were all disarmed and captured by our militia. A total of eight special agents were captured, and eight rifles and pistols were seized. Furthermore, on the night of the 16th of this month, dozens of armed special agents of the Yuanshi "Returning Home Corps" raided our Gaocun in Zanhuang. They were repelled by the village militia after a night of fierce fighting. That night, Wang Bingwu, a special agent of the "Returning Home Corps" in the village, secretly surrounded the village, attempting to wipe out the militia in one fell swoop. When the militia discovered this, they had already entered the village. The militia, prepared with fortifications, immediately returned fire and sent a squad to outflank the enemy. With fierce hand grenades, they drove out more than 30 people who had attacked from the south of the village. Another group attacking from the northwest was also repelled by hand grenades near the fortifications. After about three hours of fierce fighting, they could not hold out and fled, leaving two dead and several wounded. We suffered no casualties. During the battle, militia Wang Lianhai bravely picked up a hand grenade thrown into the fortifications by the enemy and threw it back. Militia Captain Gu Fengtu fought while shouting slogans and, single-handedly attracted the enemy's fire on the flank to protect the fortifications.
    [Another report] Yang Wenmao's puppet troops from Anyang attacked our ×licun, and four of them were killed or wounded by the militia. On the 20th of last month, the puppet troops, in coordination with a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, attacked again, but were also repelled by the village militia in coordination with the regular army, resulting in more than 20 Chiang Kai-shek puppet platoon leaders and lower ranks being killed. On the same afternoon, Mao Runjiang's Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops attacked Qicun, but were also repelled by our local armed forces.

    元氏民兵捕获潜入深山武装特务队八名
    【本报长治十七日电】太行武委会特通令嘉奖安阳民兵。该县蒋伪军侵占我曲沟等地后，被占村庄民兵撤出本村，即结合其周围村民兵，组成保家自卫联防，展开敌后游击战争。一区民兵组成飞行爆炸组，六、七、八等区民兵亦组成小型游击队，在区长姚震、区武委会主任杨殿文、政委杜进之等同志率领下，进行爆炸、围困，夜夜摸袭，主动进攻，八月底的五天内，即作战二十余次，毙伤俘蒋伪军二百余人，民兵翻身英雄王荣青在袭击东彰庄时，果敢突入村中，打击蒋伪，摧彼凶焰，使蒋伪坐困，蚕食毒计无法施展。此种英勇自卫行动，值得全区民兵效法。
    【本报长治十七日电】上月二十九日我元氏民兵歼灭暗伏于我解放区内扰害地方之小股特务武装一股，此事值得我区军民严重警惕。该股特务暗藏于元氏获鹿两县交界之封龙山破庙中，夜间即出扰我元苏庄、牛家庄、石板沟、仙翁寨等地，是日为我种山地农民所发觉，当即引民兵上山包围，该特务等因夜间活动，白日沉睡，当被我民兵全部缴械捕获，计特务八人，缴长枪手枪各八支。又本月十六日夜间，元氏特务武装“还乡团”数十人奔袭我赞皇高村，为该村民兵激战一夜所击退，是夜“还乡团”在该村之特务王秉五引导下，秘密将村包围，企图将民兵一网打尽，当民兵发觉时，已进入村内，民兵有工事准备，即一面还击，一面派出一班迂回，以猛烈的手榴弹，将由村南攻入之三十余人逐出，村西北攻入另一股走至工事附近，亦被手榴弹击退，激战约三小时，不支窜去，计毙二名，伤数名，我无伤亡。战斗中民兵王连海极英勇将该伪投入工事内之手榴弹拾起投回。民兵队长谷峰秃一面作战，一面喊话，并独在侧翼吸引伪军火力，以保卫工事。
    【又讯】安阳伪军杨文貌部进犯我×里村，被民兵毙伤其四名。上月二十日，该伪又协同蒋军一个营来犯，亦在该村民兵与正规军配合下击退，计毙蒋伪排长以下二十余名。同日下午，毛润蒋伪军犯齐村，亦被我地方武装所击退。
