　　[This Dispatch from the Tongpu Front, September 3rd] Our reporter visited a prisoner of war camp in the rear of the Hong Zhao front. There are more than 500 prisoners here, all of whom were liberated from Yan Xishan's invading army. Among them is Tian Zhongxi, who is as old as sixty-five, and Li Xiaoquan, who is as young as under ten. The old should be enjoying their twilight years, and the young should be nurtured by their parents. But they were all drafted by Yan Xishan's "integration of soldiers and farmers" to be cannon fodder for the civil war. They tearfully told the reporter about Yan Xishan's crimes. Tian Zhongxi said: "Yan Xishan forced us to leave our homeland with guns, and then used guns to persecute the common people. We had no choice but to hand over our guns to your Eighth Route Army so that we could go home sooner." This demand against the civil war is not only held by new recruits, but even by middle and lower-ranking officers who have followed Yan Xishan for many years. Yan Qi, the lieutenant colonel of the Third Detachment of the Vanguard Force, was deeply dissatisfied with Yan Xishan's collusion with the enemy during the War of Resistance. He hoped to retire to his hometown after the victory of the War of Resistance, but Yan Xishan insisted on forcing him to lead troops to fight in the civil war. He took the lead in laying down his arms on the battlefield and said with joy: "From now on, I have escaped the sea of suffering of the civil war!"
　　[This Dispatch from Yangcheng, September 3rd] Hundreds of bunkers and fortifications left by Yan's puppets in the Hong (tong) and Zhao (cheng) liberated areas have now been completely demolished. 50,000 peasants from Hong (tong), Fu (shan), and An (ze) counties participated in this massive project. More than 8,000 people from Fushan, sixty miles away, spontaneously gathered and rushed to the front line overnight with shovels and hoes. The demolition work began on the 27th and was completed on the 28th.

　　阎锡山迫使老弱从军
    官兵殷望逃脱内战
    洪赵阎伪碉堡悉数平毁
    【本报同蒲前线三日电】记者访问洪赵前线后方某俘虏收容所。这里共有五百多位俘虏，他们都是从阎锡山进犯军中被解放的。他们之中有老至六十五岁的田中喜，有小至不满十岁的李小全，老的该是乐享天年的时候了，小的还应受父母的抚育。但是他们都被阎锡山的“兵农合一”抽来当内战炮灰。他们泪珠滚滚的向记者痛诉阎锡山的罪恶。田中喜说：“阎锡山拿枪杆逼着我们离开乡土，拿着枪杆再迫害老百姓，我们只好把枪交给你们八路军好早些回家。”这种反内战的要求不只新兵有，就连追随阎锡山多年的中下级军官也是如此，挺进三支队长阎琪中校，对阎锡山在抗战中和敌人勾结深为不满，殷望抗战胜利后能解甲归田，阎锡山却非逼着他带兵打内战不可。他在战场上身先士卒地放下武器，并且庆幸地说：“从今算是脱离内战苦海了！”
    【本报阳城三日电】洪（洞）、赵（城）解放区内阎伪遗留之碉堡工事数百座，现已悉数平毁。洪（洞）、浮（山）、安（泽）等县五万农民参加这一巨大工程，六十里外的浮山群众自动集合了八千余人，拿着锹镢连夜赶赴前方。平毁工作于二十七日开始，二十八日即全部完成。
