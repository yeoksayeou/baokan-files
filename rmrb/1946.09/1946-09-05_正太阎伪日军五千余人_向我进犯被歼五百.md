　　[This dispatch from Changzhi, dated the 31st, was received late.] On the 24th, Yan's puppet army, the Duan Bingchang unit, combined with Japanese troops, totaling over 5,000 men, and launched a three-pronged attack on Songta Town, which belongs to Pingding County. Our troops launched a powerful counterattack, and the Yan puppet Japanese troops were routed on the 25th. A total of over 500 Yan-Japanese troops were killed, wounded, or captured, including two Japanese (both serving in the Second Battalion of the Security Corps reorganized by Yan Xishan). The details of the battle are as follows: On the 24th, Yan's army, mainly the Third Regiment of the 46th Division of the Duan Bingchang unit, totaling over 2,000 men, in coordination with 400-plus Japanese troops from the Second Battalion of the Security Corps, invaded southward from Lujiazhuang Station in Shouyang, passing through Lingdonggou and Jiabao Village, attempting to directly attack our Songta Town; its right-wing Yan army of over 2,000 men, in coordination with 200-plus Japanese troops from the Security Corps, simultaneously invaded eastward from Yuci City, arriving at Jijia＠, west of Songta, at 5:00 PM; the left-wing Yan army of over 500 men moved out from Langyu Station, passing through Miaosiyu to Luomosi and continuing to invade westward. The Yan-Japanese troops who launched the three-pronged attack were all obstructed by our guerrillas and militia along the way. That evening, the main force of our army rushed to the scene and compressed the Chiang-Yan-Japanese troops in Jiabao and Jingshang villages, dealing them a devastating blow. All occupied areas have now been recovered.
