　　Jidong Our Army Counterattacks on the Pinggu Line
　　Over 500 Chiang Troops Killed or Captured
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jidong Front, 27th] The brave soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, persisting in guerrilla warfare in the Jidong area, have shattered the ravings of "government" figures who predicted that "the organized resistance of the Communists in Jidong will collapse within two weeks" (see the United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 10th). The main force of the Fourteenth Military Sub-district of Jidong, which had strategically withdrawn from Sanhe, Pinggu, and other places, counterattacked the Chiang troops in the Yanggezhuang area east of Shunyi on the Pinggu line from midnight of the 21st to 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd. With a casualty ratio of one to ten, they completely annihilated two infantry companies, one machine gun company, and one mortar platoon of the First Battalion of the First Regiment of the First Column of the Chiang army, one company of the Shunyi security team, and more than thirty members of the local militia. They captured Chiang Jui-zhen, the Chiang army battalion commander, and over 400 others, killed or wounded nearly 80 Chiang soldiers, and seized twelve light and heavy machine guns, over 300 rifles and short guns, one mortar, over 44,000 rounds of ammunition, and a large quantity of other military supplies. In the week from the 14th to the 21st, the Eighth Route Army of the Fourteenth Military Sub-district of Jidong killed or wounded 188 Chiang soldiers, captured 70, and seized two light machine guns, over 70 rifles, and a portion of other military supplies. In particular, on the 20th and 21st, when the towns of Huangzhuang and Dachang south and southwest of Sanhe were captured, over 40 Chiang soldiers were captured with their weapons, over ten were killed, and one light machine gun was seized.
