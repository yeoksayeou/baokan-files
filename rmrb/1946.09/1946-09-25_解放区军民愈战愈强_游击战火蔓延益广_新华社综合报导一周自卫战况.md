Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 22nd: A comprehensive military report for the week: Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing after descending from Lushan. Chiang's newspapers and certain American news agencies touted "government army victories," but they could not conceal Chiang Kai-shek's anxiety. Liu Zhi's dismissal due to defeats is proof of this. When Chiang Kai-shek ascended Lushan, he imagined that upon his return, victory would be in his grasp and he would be crowned with glory. However, the facts before him today are the loss of 200,000 Chiang troops, the growing strength of the liberated area's military and civilians, and the burgeoning self-defense war. On the Subei battlefield, after the New Fourth Army annihilated 5,000 Chiang troops near Huaiyin, they proactively withdrew from the city. The Chiang army's invasion of Huaiyin does not signify the end of the Subei war. On the contrary, it will be the beginning of a larger-scale people's self-defense war. After the Chiang army advanced to Huaiyin, the lines of communication became longer, and the rear became more vulnerable (for example, the Chiang army in Sixian only had one regiment, and Wuhe and Lingbi each had only one battalion). The flames of people's guerrilla warfare spread even further. It is expected that the New Fourth Army will choose an appropriate time to conduct annihilation campaigns similar to the victories on the southern front. On the southern front, after each major victory by General Su Yu's troops, they replenished and expanded their main force from the Chiang troops who laid down their weapons, and helped thousands of local armed forces and militia obtain new weapons. Chiang Kai-shek's dream of "annihilating the New Fourth Army and occupying Subei within two weeks" when he ascended Lushan has been completely shattered. The New Fourth Army and the military and civilians of Suwan will fight until Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is crushed. On the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, the Chiang army has made no progress in the past week. After suffering the annihilation of four divisions (now renamed brigades) on its western flank, it concentrated the remnants of the eastern and western lines to launch a fierce attack on the Heze area. General Liu Bocheng's hammer of counterattack is waiting for the invaders. In Shandong, Chiang's commanders feel that the Jiaoji Railway is not easy to open, and even if it is opened, it cannot be maintained. Wu Huawen's puppet troops, entrenched in Dui Prefecture, invaded Jining City on the 16th to cooperate with the Chiang army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan. Wu's forces were thus dispersed, which was convenient for the powerful counterattack of the people's armed forces. In eastern Suiyuan, after Fu Zuoyi's troops occupied Jining at the cost of 3,000 men, they made no progress. Fu's troops who attempted to invade Pian Guan and Hequ once occupied the two cities, but under the self-defense counterattack of the local military and civilians, they have also retreated to their original defenses. The Chiang army is actively preparing to invade Zhangjiakou, and the military and civilians of Jin-Cha-Ji have also completed preparations to inflict a heavy blow on the invaders.

　　解放区军民愈战愈强
    游击战火蔓延益广
    新华社综合报导一周自卫战况
    【新华社延安二十二日电】一周军事综合报导：蒋介石从庐山下来首途回宁，蒋方报纸和美国某些通讯社鼓噪“政府军胜利”，掩盖不了蒋介石的燥急。刘峙因失利而撤职，即是一个明证。蒋介石在上庐山之时，满拟回来之时，胜利在握，黄袍加身。但是，今天摆在他前面的事实，是蒋军二十万人的损失，是解放区军民的愈战愈强，和自卫战争的方兴未艾。在苏北战场，新四军在淮阴近郊消灭五千蒋军以后，主动撤离该城，蒋军的侵入淮阴，并不表示苏北战争的终止。相反地，它将是更大规模人民自卫战争的开始。蒋军进至淮阴以后，交通线更延长了，后方更空虚（如泗县蒋军只有一团，五河、灵壁则只各有一营），人民游击战争的火焰更蔓延了。预料新四军将选择适当时机，进行类似南线大捷的歼灭战役。在南线，粟裕将军所部每次大捷之后，从放下武器的蒋军补充和扩大自己的主力，并帮助成千成万的地方武装和民兵获取新式的武器。蒋介石上庐山时“两星期内消灭新四军，占领苏北”的梦想，完全破产了。新四军和苏皖军民将一直打到粉碎蒋介石进攻为止。冀鲁豫战场，蒋军近一周来无何进展，在其西翼遭受四个师（现改称旅）的歼灭失败后，即集中东线及西线残部猛攻荷泽地区，刘伯承将军的反击巨锤正等候着进犯者。山东方面，蒋方指挥官感觉胶济路不易打通，即打通了亦无法保持。困据兑州之伪军吴化文部，为配合冀鲁豫蒋军于十六日侵占济宁城，吴逆兵力因此分散，适便于人民武装之有力反击。绥东方面，傅作义部以三千人之代价，侵陷集宁后，无何进展。进窥偏关、河曲之傅军，一度侵占该两城，但在当地军民自卫反击下，亦已退返原防。而蒋军积极准备进犯张家口，晋察冀军民亦已完成予进犯者以重大打击的准备。
