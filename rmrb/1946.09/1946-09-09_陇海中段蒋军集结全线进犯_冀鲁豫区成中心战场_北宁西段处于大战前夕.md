Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: On the Zheng (Zhou) - Xu (Zhou) section of the Longhai Railway, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have massed more than 300,000 soldiers in thirty-five divisions, accounting for one-sixth to one-third of the total force attacking the liberated areas. In late August, they launched a full-scale offensive, advancing towards the Eighth Route Army positions in Dongming, Dingtao, Caoxian, Shanxian, and Fengxian in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area north of the Longhai Railway. This area has become the central battlefield of the current civil war. The right-wing Chiang Kai-shek troops have continued to capture Peixian and Fengxian. The left-wing Chiang Kai-shek's Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army) and the Forty-first Division (formerly the Army) occupied Dulou and Baimaoji, east of Kaocheng, on the 30th, and continued to attack the Eighth Route Army's defenses with four regiments, of which over seven hundred were annihilated. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the central section of the Jinpu Railway captured the important town of Taierzhuang in southern Shandong on the 2nd, attempting to continue their attacks on Yixian and Zaozhuang, and jointly with Wu Huawen's puppet troops entrenched in Yanzhou to open the Yanzhou-Lincheng section of the Jinpu Railway. Meanwhile, a powerful mobile corps of the Eighth Route Army appeared in the eastern Henan area south of the Longhai Railway at this time, and successively recovered Taikang, more than two hundred li southeast of Kaifeng, and Huaiyang to its south, on the 29th of last month and the 2nd of this month, annihilating all the puppet troops in the cities. Both cities are highway hubs, and Huaiyang is a famous historical city. With the loss of these two cities, Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Chenzhou felt a major threat to their rear in Henan and northwest Anhui.
    On the Tongpu Railway: Hu Zongnan's troops in southern Shanxi made slow progress. The Eighth Route Army recovered Fujiatan, forty li southwest of Houma, on the 1st. Fujiatan is one of the famous anthracite coal mining areas in Shanxi, which used to have more than 30,000 workers, and is the last stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's advancing army in the area. So far, the 270-li railway from Jiexiu Yitang section to Luqu, east of Linfen, on the Tongpu Railway, has been completely controlled by the Eighth Route Army.
    The war in Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning has fully unfolded. Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Tangshan-Linyu section of the Beining Railway have advanced along the Great Wall in multiple directions. They captured the important towns of Lengkou and Xiaojiaying along the Great Wall on the 2nd, and are poised to continue their attacks on Zunhua, the capital of the eastern Hebei liberated area, as well as Jianchangying and Qian'an. Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacking south of the railway occupied ＠cheng on the 31st, and then captured Leting County. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Xianghe on the western section of the Beining Railway are continuing to reinforce, and the area is on the eve of a major battle. After occupying Chengde, Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Rehe are advancing north to Chifeng and south to Gubeikou.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 5th: The 346th Regiment of the 116th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which occupied Doushan, gathered nearby puppet bandits and continued to flee towards the Great Wall. On the 2nd, they successively occupied the important towns of Xiaojiaying and Lengkou in the liberated area, and were poised to attack Jianchangying and Qian'an in the south. Chiang Kai-shek's troops along the Tangshan-Fengrun line continued to reinforce. On the morning of the 3rd, a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops was transferred from Tangshan to Cuimazhuang (south of Fengrun). They are now forcibly driving more than a thousand civilians day and night to repair roads, actively preparing to attack Zunhua, the capital of the eastern Hebei liberated area. Eleven trains of troops arrived at Guye and Kaiping from Tianjin along the Beining Railway on the 4th. The Chiang Kai-shek's troops concentrated in Linxi and Zhanguanzhuang and other places in Guye, claiming that they would attack Zhenzitown north of the Beining Railway. The Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Xianghe front continued to reinforce. On the 2nd, a battalion of the 92nd Army, attached with four mountain guns, was transferred from Ping to Tongxian, and they are building fortresses along the Tongxian-Anping section of the Pingjin Highway. Four fortresses have been built near the pier. Once the deployment is completed, they may launch another offensive.

　　陇海中段蒋军集结全线进犯
    冀鲁豫区成中心战场
    北宁西段处于大战前夕
    【新华社延安六日电】陇海路郑（州）徐（州）段集结蒋军三十五个师三十万人以上，占进攻解放区总兵力六分之一到三分之一。上月下旬全线出动，向陇海路北冀鲁豫解放区东明、定陶、曹县、单县、丰县八路军阵地进扑。该处遂成为当前内战的中心战场。右翼蒋军已继续侵陷沛县、丰县，左翼蒋军第三师（原第十军）及四十一师（原军）三十日侵占考城东之杜楼、白矛集，续以四个团猛攻八路军防地，当被消灭七百以上。同时津浦中段蒋军二日攻陷鲁南重镇台儿庄，图续犯峄县、枣庄，联合困踞兖州伪军吴化文部打通津浦路兖州至临城段。而八路军强大机动兵团即于此时出现于陇海路南豫东地区，于上月二十九日及本月二日相继收复开封东南二百余里之太康及其南之淮阳，城内伪军全部就歼。二城均为公路中心，淮阳且系历代名城，陈州蒋军失此二城，河南与皖西北后方即感受重大威胁。
    同蒲路方面：晋南胡宗南部进展迟缓，侯马以八路军于一日收复灵石西南四十里之傅家滩。傅家滩为山西著名无烟煤矿区之一，过去拥有工人三万余，系该处进军最后一个据点。至此同蒲路介休义棠段至临汾东芦曲二百七十里铁路，已完全为八路军控制。
    冀热辽战事已全面展开，北宁路唐山至临榆段蒋军分路进犯长城沿线，已于二日侵陷长城要隘冷口与萧家营等重镇，有续犯冀东解放区首都遵化与建昌营、迁安模样。向路南进攻之蒋军三十一日侵占＠城后，继陷乐亭县城。北宁西段香河蒋军正继续增援，该地处于大战前夕。热河蒋军于侵占承德后，正北犯赤峰，南攻古北口。
    【新华社遵化五日电】侵陷都山之蒋军一一六师三四六团，纠集附近伪匪续向长城一线窜犯。二日连续侵占解放区萧家营、冷口等重镇，有南犯建昌营，迁安模样。唐山、丰润一线蒋军继续增援，三日上午由唐山增至崔马庄（丰润南）蒋军一个团，现正强驱千余民夫，昼夜抢修道路，积极准备进犯冀东解放区首府遵化。北宁沿线四日由津开抵古冶、开平兵车十一列，增至古冶蒋军已分别集中林西、占官庄等地，扬言将向北宁路北榛子镇进攻。香河前线蒋军继续增援，二日由平增至通县九十二军之一营，附山炮四门，并沿平津公路通县、安平段大修堡垒，现已在码头附近修成四座，一俟调动布置完竣，有再度发动进攻之势。
