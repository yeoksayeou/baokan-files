　　邯郸 City Women from All Walks of Life Hold a Gathering to Support Soong Ching Ling and Deng Yingchao Attending the International Women's Federation Conference
    [Report from this newspaper in Handan] To support Soong Ching Ling and Deng Yingchao in attending the International Women's Congress, women from all walks of life in Handan City held a symposium on the 11th of this month. More than 200 representatives attended, including not only female staff from all walks of life, but also female comrades from the Fifth Division who had just returned from thousands of miles away. Liberated women and mass leaders accounted for 60% of the representatives present.
    After Chairman Sun Wenshu announced the opening of the meeting, Handan Deputy Mayor Feng attended and delivered a speech, encouraging women from all walks of life to organize to support the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. He emphasized that it is of great significance for everyone to bring the demands of women from all walks of life to the International Women's Congress. Then, 23 newly liberated women spoke one after another, expressing their extreme indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's collusion with the United States to unreasonably attack the liberated areas. They were determined to do their best to take on rear service work and strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. From then on, the speeches at the conference turned to proposals. A female comrade who had just come from Beiping bitterly denounced the crimes of the KMT-controlled areas' secret service rule, and proposed that the United Nations send personnel to investigate, hoping that the International Women's Congress would send personnel to participate in this investigation. Comrade Han Li proposed "requesting the US military to leave China immediately and to cancel the material negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek." An Xing, a doctor from the Peace Hospital, proposed "requesting the International Women's Congress to help Chinese medicine!" These proposals were unanimously approved by the conference, with a total of more than 20 kinds of proposals being put forward. Finally, after Comrade Song Weijing made a summary of the conference, a telegram was passed to Ms. Soong and Ms. Deng, the original text of which is as follows:
    To Ms. Soong Ching Ling and Ms. Deng Yingchao, forwarded to Mrs. Coutten, President of the International Women's Federation:
    We are delighted to hear that the International Women's Federation will hold a meeting in October. On behalf of 15 million women in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region of the liberated areas of China, this conference extends its sincere congratulations. We support Ms. Soong Ching Ling and Ms. Deng Yingchao as representatives of Chinese women to attend the International Women's Federation. We firmly believe that these two outstanding female leaders will be able to fully express the opinions of Chinese women. We would also like to take this opportunity to submit to you: The vast number of women in the Kuomintang areas are still living in terror and starvation without freedom. Women in the liberated areas of China are under great threat due to the large-scale offensive launched by the Kuomintang with the support of the United States. We appeal to the Federation to mobilize freedom-loving women around the world to urge the U.S. government to abandon its imperialist policy of supporting the Kuomintang's civil war and interfering in China's internal affairs, investigate the crimes committed by the Sino-U.S. reactionaries in their joint attack on the Chinese people, and launch a global women's movement to support the Chinese people's patriotic self-defense war, so that the Chinese people can freely choose the political system and way of life they desire, which will contribute to lasting world peace.

　　邯市各界妇女二百人集会
    拥护宋庆龄邓颖超出席国际妇联大会
    【本报邯郸讯】为拥护宋庆龄邓颖超参加国际妇女大会，邯市各界妇女，于本月十一日，集会座谈，到会代表二百余人，不仅包括各行各业的妇女职员，而且新从千里归来的五师女同志均赶来赴会。翻身妇女与群众领袖，共占到会代表的百分之六十。
    主席孙文淑同志宣布开会后，邯市冯副市长亲临讲话，鼓励各界妇女应组织起来支援爱国自卫战争胜利，并着重指出大家能把各阶层妇女的要求，带到国际妇女大会上去，其意义是十分重大的。接着有二十三位才翻身的妇女相继发言，他们对蒋介石勾结美国无理进攻解放区表示极度愤慨，他们决心要以全力来担任后方勤务，争取爱国自卫战争胜利。自此大会发言转到提案上来了；一位新从北平来的女同志痛陈蒋管区的特务统治罪恶后，提出要求联合国派员来调查，希望国际妇女大会派员参加这一调查。韩黎同志提出“要求美军迅即离华，并撤消与蒋介石的物资谈判。”和平医院安医生寒星同志提出“要求国际妇女大会帮助中国医药！”这些提案，当经大会一致通过，总计提出大小提案共二十余种。最后大会由宋维静同志做了总结后，通过致宋邓二女士一电，原文如下：
    宋庆龄邓颖超二女士转国际妇联会长考登夫人：
    欣闻国际妇联将于十月开会，本会代表中国解放区晋冀鲁豫边区一千五百万妇女，谨致祝贺之忱。吾人拥护宋庆龄、邓颖超两女士代表中国妇女出席国际妇联，深信此二位卓越的妇女领袖，定能充分表达中国妇女之意见。吾人并愿乘此机会向阁下提出：中国国民党区之广大妇女，现仍生活在无自由的恐怖与饥饿中，中国解放区妇女由于国民党在美国支持下发动大规模进攻，而感受极大威胁，吾人吁请妇联动员全世界爱好自由之妇女，促使美国政府放弃支援国民党内战与干涉中国内政的帝国主义政策，调查中美反动派联合向中国人民进攻所制造之罪行，发动全世界妇女支援中国人民爱国自卫战争，俾中国人民能自由选择其所希冀的政治制度与生活方式，这将有助于世界持久的和平。
