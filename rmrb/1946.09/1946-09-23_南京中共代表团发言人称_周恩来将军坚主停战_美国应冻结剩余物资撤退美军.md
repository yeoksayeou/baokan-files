　　Nanjing CCP Delegation Spokesperson States
    Zhou Enlai Firmly Advocates for Ceasefire
    U.S. Should Freeze Remaining Supplies and Withdraw American Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Wang Bingnan, spokesperson for the CCP delegation, announced: CCP representative Zhou Enlai has gone from Nanjing to Shanghai regarding the "Masses Weekly" incident in Shanghai. Zhou Enlai insists on convening the Three-Person Peace Committee and issuing a ceasefire order. Wang Bingnan stated: Only by freezing the remaining supplies, withdrawing American troops, and ceasing other aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, can people be convinced that the American government does not want a civil war in China. He said: Judging from the recent situation, on the one hand, mediators verbally say they want peace, while on the other hand, American policy is to help the Kuomintang wage a civil war, enabling the warmongers to obtain continuous American aid to carry out the civil war.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] According to a special dispatch from the Beiping Xinmin Daily in Nanjing on the 8th: New York Times reporter Lippmann from the United States is currently writing a biography of Zhou Enlai, and visits Mr. Zhou at the Plum Garden New Village every day for several hours of talks.

　　南京中共代表团发言人称
    周恩来将军坚主停战
    美国应冻结剩余物资撤退美军
    【新华社南京二十日电】中共代表团发言人王炳南宣称：中共代表周恩来为上海《群众周刊》事件，已由南京赴沪。周恩来坚持召开三人和平委员会及发表停战令之主张。王炳南称：只有冻结剩余物资，撤退美军，停止对蒋介石政府之其他援助，才能使得人们相信美国政府不愿中国有内战。他说：根据最近的形势看来，一方面调解人口头说要和平，另一方面则美国政策是帮助国民党进行内战，使好战分子得到不断的美国援助来进行内战。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据北平新民报南京八日专电称：美国纽约时报记者李普曼，近为周恩来写传记，每日前往梅园新村访周氏谈数小时。
