　　Kuomintang Shelves Li-Wen Case
    Democratic League Files Protest
    Denouncing it as a Farce and a Mockery
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] Nanjing News: The Democratic League's Political Consultative Conference (PCC) representatives have lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities regarding their handling of the Wen and Li cases, which they see as being handled with pretense and without any real investigation. The letter of protest was delivered to Chiang Kai-shek on August 30th through the Kuomintang PCC representatives. The letter of protest points out that the authorities' handling of the Wen case is a fraud and a mockery, and lists three facts: (1) Although the League was invited to send observers to the trial, Liang Shuming et al. replied that Liang, Zhou Xinmin, and Feng Sutao would attend, but this was not fully agreed to. At the same time, in addition to the two reporters designated by the Central News Agency, other journalists were not allowed to participate. (2) During the trial, there was only questioning and answering between the judge and one of the perpetrators. No one was allowed to cross-examine, and all due cross-examination was refused. (3) When the public learned that the company commander and platoon leader of the 3rd company of the Special Service Battalion of the Garrison Headquarters were the perpetrators, they unanimously predicted that even if the death penalty was handed down, they would be replaced at the time of execution. Indeed, according to a special dispatch in the Ta Kung Pao: When the perpetrators of the Wen case were executed on the 26th, security was tight along the route. Is it not clear that they did not want people to witness this? This is a true fraud; how can it be convincing? Therefore, we must protest the government's disagreement with the Democratic League's participation in the investigation and the participation of all parties in the trial, insisting on handling everything single-handedly. On the one hand, we express that we cannot fully accept the handling of the Wen case; on the other hand, we state that the Li case must be transferred to Nanjing for public trial, and all parties must be given the opportunity to participate in the trial. The letter of protest points out that the Li case occurred over six months ago, and there is still no news. If it is delayed any further, it will be postponed indefinitely and left unresolved, which the national government cannot justify to the people. The letter of protest demands that the Li case be strictly ordered to be solved within a time limit, and that those responsible for the past delays be punished.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] Nanjing News: The Democratic League's PCC representatives submitted a letter of protest to the Kuomintang authorities on August 31st regarding the assault on Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan in Chengdu by secret service thugs. The letter was delivered to the Kuomintang PCC representatives to be forwarded to Chiang Kai-shek.

　　国民党对李闻案包而不办
    民盟提出抗议书
    斥为一种骗局与滑稽戏
    【新华社延安七日电】南京讯：民盟政协代表为国民党当局包办伪装处理闻案、李案，而久不破案，特向国民党当局提出严重抗议，抗议书已于八月三十日由蒋方政协代表转达蒋介石。抗议书指出当局处理闻案，乃系一种骗局与滑稽戏，并列举三项事实称：（１）审判时虽经函邀审同盟派员观审，而梁漱溟等函复由梁及周新民、冯素陶三人前往，却未获完全同意，同时新闻记者除被指定之中央社二人外，亦不许其他人参加。（２）审判时只有法官与凶犯之一问一答，全无任何人参加质证，一切应有之质证全不肯用。（３）当社会闻知系警备司令部特务营第三连连长及其排长为凶犯时，即异口同声预言将来纵判死刑，而执行时必另有替换。果然，据大公报专电报导：二十六日枪决闻案凶犯时，沿途所经，戒备严密，其不肯与人以共见，岂不甚明？此真是一种骗局，何足以服人？据此，吾人对于政府之不同意民盟参加调查及各方面参加审判，而必一手包办到底，不能不提抗议，一面表示对于闻案处理不能完全接受；一面表示李案非移京公开审判，并予各方面以参加审讯机会不可。抗议书指出李案发生，时逾六旬，迄无下文，若再延搁，势将无期延期，以不了了之，此国家政府实无以对人民。抗议书要求对于李案应严令限期破案，并对过去之逾期未能破案加以处分。
    【新华社延安七日电】南京讯：民盟政协代表为民盟主席张澜氏在蓉被特务暴徒凶殴事，于八月三十一日向国民党当局提出抗议书一件，递交国民党政协代表转达蒋介石。
