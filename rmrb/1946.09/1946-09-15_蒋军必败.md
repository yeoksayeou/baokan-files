　　Chiang Kai-shek's Army Is Bound to Fail
    Liberation Daily Editorial, September 12

    News of victory arrives! Our valiant troops led by General Liu Bocheng have annihilated four brigades (originally divisions) of Chiang Kai-shek's invading army under Liu Zhi in the area between Heze, Dingtao, Cao County, and Dongming, north of the Longhai Railway. Zhao Xitian, commander of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage 3rd Division (formerly commander of the 10th Army), was captured. This is another great victory following the successful breakthrough of our army in the Central Plains and the great victory in Central Jiangsu. These three victories have played an important role in reversing the situation on the southern front of the entire Liberated Area. The situation of Chiang Kai-shek's army being bound to fail and our army being bound to win is now set.

    Chiang Kai-shek is deploying 85 percent of his forces to attack the Liberated Areas. Only Chiang Kai-shek's lackeys would say that this is "the CCP sabotaging the ceasefire agreement," and only American political swindlers would say that "the civil war is not yet serious" and "mediation has not yet failed."

    Since June 25, when Chiang Kai-shek violated the ceasefire agreement within the passes, Chiang Kai-shek's invading army that has been completely annihilated or suffered devastating blows has reached 19 brigades (originally divisions). Every victory of our army will be highly praised by people from all walks of life across the country. Because in the situation where Chiang Kai-shek relies on American blood transfusions and recklessly launches a desperate all-out civil war, the hopes of the people across the country are pinned on the victory of our People's Liberated Areas.

    Taking this opportunity, we would like to pay our respects to the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, the Democratic Founding Army, the Democratic Allied Army, the Central China Democratic Allied Army, and all People's Armies, especially to our soldiers on the Longhai Front, the Central Jiangsu Front, and the New Fourth Army's Fifth Division! We pay our respects to the soldiers who gloriously sacrificed and were gloriously wounded for the defense of the Liberated Areas and for the defense of independence, peace, and democracy! We pay our respects to the vast number of guerrillas and militia who enthusiastically participated in the war! We also have some important words to say to the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas and to the people of the whole country:

    First, we must completely abandon any illusions about the United States government, and therefore we must completely abandon the illusion that so-called independent peace and democracy can be easily obtained, and therefore we must also completely abandon the illusion that the civil war will end easily. As far as China's internal situation is concerned, the people already have sufficient strength to end Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, which is selling out the country and waging civil war, and replace it with a democratic coalition government. The Chinese people do not hope that the United States government will help them; the Chinese people only hope that it will implement Roosevelt's policy; that is, they hope that it will implement a middle-of-the-road policy: a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs, and support China in realizing a coalition government in which everyone from workers and peasants to Chiang Kai-shek is represented. As long as the United States government's policy toward China is not an imperialist policy but a democratic policy, this is easy for the United States government to do. The Chinese people have held this hope and tested it twice for a year: the first time was during the Hurley and Wedemeyer period, and the second time was during the Marshall period. After these two tests, there is now no doubt about the imperialist nature of the United States government's policy; there is also no doubt that the United States government has violated Roosevelt's policy and has similarly violated the spirit of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference announcement, just as it abandoned the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam agreements. We must deeply recognize that American capitalism is no longer the capitalism of free competition, but the capitalism of monopoly capital that has developed to an unprecedented peak in the world. We must deeply recognize that the veritable warlords of the United States emerged during World War II, and they have actually had a decisive say in the United States' foreign policy. This group of reactionary warlords includes Leahy, MacArthur, Wedemeyer, and others. Now, under the combination of huge monopoly capital and warlords, the imperialist color of American politics is becoming increasingly strong, and fascist forces are growing in the United States; while the American people are gradually awakening and fighting against this reactionary force to defend the democratic traditions of the United States.

    Recent facts show that this group of warlord reactionaries in the United States is openly promoting the preparation for war. An American radio listener poll showed that an absolute majority of eight to two favored the United States withdrawing its troops stationed in China, but Admiral Kirk, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in China, publicly stated that the U.S. Navy and its Marines would remain in China indefinitely. The so-called "surplus materials" trade between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek government has succeeded in a heinous transaction despite the opposition of the entire Chinese people. The United States government's policy toward China is shifting from the two-sided policy after Hurley's departure to Hurley's open pro-Chiang, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-democratic policy. Isn't that clear enough? The United States government is working so hard to colonize China, so generously helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, and still refuses to admit the civil war in China, refuses to admit the failure of mediation, and is unwilling to withdraw its troops stationed in China. What else can it do besides leave a deep impression of treachery?

    American monopoly capital and warlords, this group of rich and powerful imperialists, want to fight a third world war and use Japan and China as huge military bases for conducting the war. This policy has been determined. Therefore, its policy toward China is determined to support Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt and dictatorial government. And Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government, according to them, must fight a civil war to maintain itself. If Chiang Kai-shek doesn't fight a civil war, he is afraid of being "dragged down." In other words, he is afraid that the people will demand democracy; if there is democracy, Chiang Kai-shek's group will be held accountable for countless crimes; and Chiang Kai-shek's group has too many crimes, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot compensate for even one ten-thousandth of his crimes. That is why Chiang Kai-shek must fight a civil war, and American aid to Chiang Kai-shek has no other meaning than to help him fight the civil war.

    Therefore, we must understand that as long as reactionaries are still powerful in the United States and still have enough power to interfere in China's affairs, the civil war will not stop; even if it stops, it will only be a period of preparation for a new civil war, like the situation after January this year.

    Second, where is the basic guarantee of our victory? The Chinese people have many favorable conditions, but the basic guarantee lies in the existence of the Liberated Areas, in the strength of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and in the implementation of "land to the tiller" in the Liberated Areas. The first of the above three basic guarantees has been clear to everyone for a long time; the second, some people inside and outside the Liberated Areas did not understand, for example, after the Political Consultative Conference, some democratic人士 (démocrǎ rénshì - democrats) thought that the CCP should make more concessions in the military field, but now more people will understand this issue; the third, more people outside the Liberated Areas among the democratic人士 (démocrǎ rénshì - democrats) do not understand, so it should be explained again.

    Why is the realization of "land to the tiller" the basic guarantee of the people's victory? Because without it, there would be no Liberated Areas, and there would be no strength of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. The Chinese People's Democratic Liberation Movement has been going on for more than 100 years, and it has failed many times. What is the reason for the failure? It lies in the fact that although these movements are the people's movements and their purpose is to liberate the people, they are only the movements of a small number of people among the people, and they have no relationship or close relationship with the 80 percent of the peasants. The vast number of peasants are still forced to arm themselves or go to the battlefield under the oppression and deception of imperialist and feudal forces to oppose the revolution. Therefore, although this kind of movement is very good, it is like a floating duckweed without roots. It is not strong, it cannot withstand the big storm, it can only be a sensation for a while, but under one or two serious blows from imperialist and feudal forces, it will collapse. Only by implementing "land to the tiller" and truly liberating the peasants can the people's liberation movement have roots, like pine and cypress trees, which will not be shaken in the storm. No matter what imperialism, what feudal forces, or what American weapons, there is no way to eliminate it. The peasants in the Liberated Areas have requested the implementation of "land to the tiller" three times during the Anti-Japanese War, and they put forward this request for the fourth time after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The CCP Central Committee agreed to this legitimate request of the peasants, and at the same time guaranteed the lives of the landlords and the lives of the landlords who returned to the Liberated Areas. It is this movement of "land to the tiller" that has greatly consolidated and strengthened the People's Liberation Army in the Liberated Areas. The soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas can annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's army, which is equipped with new weapons by the United States, with relatively poor weapons. If the CCP had not agreed to the peasants' request to realize "land to the tiller," and Chiang Kai-shek had obtained the foreign aid of American imperialists, then in this civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement would not have been impossible to fail as it did in 1927.

    Third, we must never be arrogant, never underestimate the enemy, and never have illusions about "quick victory." It is true that Chiang Kai-shek's side has three fatal weaknesses: the army's war-weariness, the people's opposition, and the economic crisis. The Liberated Areas are the opposite of these three problems, which is a favorable aspect. However, on the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek has a powerful imperialist foreign aid, while the Chinese people only have the foreign aid of world people and American public opinion. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's army has better weapons, which makes the war extremely cruel, and it takes a great price to win victory on the battlefield. If the command of the battle and combat is not careful, it will suffer. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek can use American economic assistance to replenish his army, dare to gamble everything, and dare to declare that he will fight for a year: "See if I can eliminate the Communist Party within a year." If we think further, this war can last for more than a year, and because of the continuous supply from the United States, even if Chiang Kai-shek stops the war, a new war will break out.

    Due to this situation, the Chinese people should never underestimate the enemy in this war, especially the troops that have won the battle. They must not be arrogant. The generals commanding the army must not be negligent in any way, especially after the victory. Every battle must be carefully considered and prepared. It should be known that Chiang Kai-shek still has the strength with the blood transfusion from the United States; it should be known that Chiang Kai-shek's army has already occupied some places in the Liberated Areas, including Chengde, and it will take a hard struggle to recover these places; it should be known that Chiang Kai-shek is still spreading the flames of war to the whole country. In addition to the Central Plains, Central Jiangsu, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the battles in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Shandong, Jiaoji, Rehe, Eastern Hebei, Southern Shanxi, and Suiyuan have already begun, and the battles in Northeast China and other regions will soon begin.

    But no matter what, the Chinese people and the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas will always win. The general weakness of all reactionary forces at home and abroad is their political reaction. Any force, as long as it is reactionary, no matter how powerful it is, it will definitely fall. Didn't the reactionary Qing Dynasty fall? Didn't the reactionary Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlords fall? Didn't the reactionary Hitler, Mussolini, and Japanese imperialism fall? These reactionaries were once "powerful" when they were in power, but this was only temporary and superficial power. In fact, because of their reaction, that is, their detachment from the people, their political life had already ended, and they would fall as soon as the wind blows, sooner or later. Sure enough, all the reactionary forces in history have fallen. Only the progressive forces of the people can grow, grow stronger, and continue their lives forever. The current reactionaries, whether Chinese or foreign, no matter how "powerful" military and financial resources they hold in their hands, will definitely fall. The reason for this is because the Chinese and foreign reactionaries want to oppress the vast number of Chinese and foreign people, which will inevitably lead to the vast number of Chinese and foreign people rising up and fighting them resolutely, and the result will inevitably be the fall of the reactionaries. The reason why the self-defense war of the Chinese people and the Chinese Liberated Areas is bound to win is because of the progressiveness of our cause. Therefore, all justice is on our side. Although the road we are taking is tortuous, we will definitely reach our destination.

　　蒋军必败
    解放日报十二日社论
    捷报传来，我刘伯承将军所率劲旅，在陇海线以北之荷泽、定陶、曹县、东明间地区，消灭蒋介石进犯军刘峙部四个旅（原师），蒋介石嫡系第三师师长（原为第十军军长）赵锡田就擒，这是继续中原我军突围胜利与苏中大捷之后又一次大胜利。这三个胜利，对于整个解放区的南方战线，起了扭转局面的重要作用。蒋军必败，我军必胜的局面，是定下来了。
    蒋介石倾其兵力百分之八十五进攻解放区，只有蒋介石的喽罗才说得出这反倒是“中共破坏停战协定”，只有美国的政治骗子手说得出“内战尚不严重”、“调处尚未失败”。
    自六月二十五日蒋介石破坏关内的停战协定以来，被我彻底歼灭或受到歼灭性打击的蒋介石进犯军，至此已达十九个旅（原师）。我军的每一个胜利，将受到全国各界人民最高的赞扬。因为在蒋介石依靠美国输血、悍然不顾一切发动孤注一掷的全面内战情况下，全国人民的希望都寄托于我们人民解放区的胜利。
    趁这个机会，我们谨向八路军、新四军、东北民主联军、民主建国军、民主同盟军、华中民主联军及一切人民军队，特别向我们陇海前线将士、苏中前线将士与新四军五师将士致敬！向为保卫解放区、为保卫独立和平民主而光荣牺牲和光荣负伤的将士致敬！我们谨向广大的热烈参战的游击队、民兵致敬！我们并且有几句重要的话，要向解放区军民和全国人民说一说：
    第一，我们必须彻底抛弃对于美国政府的任何幻想，因而必须彻底抛弃所谓独立和平民主可以轻易获得的幻想，因而又必须彻底抛弃内战将会容易结束的幻想。就中国的内部情况来说，人民已经有充分的力量来结束卖国内战独裁的蒋介石专政，而代以民主的联合政府。中国人民对于美国政府并不希望它帮助，中国人民只希望它执行罗斯福的政策；即是说，希望它执行一个中间的政策：不干涉中国内政的政策，赞助中国实现一个从工农到蒋介石都有代表权的联合政府。只要美国政府的对华政策不是帝国主义政策、而是民主主义政策，这件事对于美国政府是轻而易举的。中国人民抱着这种希望，一年之久试验了两次：第一次是赫尔利、魏特迈时期，第二次是马歇尔时期。经过了这两次试验，现在对于美国政府政策的帝国主义性质，是没有怀疑的了；对于美国政府的违背罗斯福政策及其像背弃德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨顿诸协定的精神那样，同样的背弃莫斯科三国外长会议公告，也是毫无怀疑的了。我们应当深刻认识，美国的资本主义已经不是什么自由竞争的资本主义，而是垄断资本发展到世界上空前未有的最高点的那种资本主义。应当深刻认识，第二次世界大战中，美国的名符其实的军阀是产生出来了，并且首先在美国的对外政策上实际上有了决定的发言权。这批反动的军阀，包括李海、麦克阿瑟、魏特迈等在内。现在美国的政治，在巨大的垄断资本与军阀的结合之下，帝国主义的色彩越来越浓厚，法西斯的势力在美国增长起来；而美国人民则正在逐步觉醒起来，与这种反动势力进行斗争，保卫美国的民主传统。
    最近的事实，美国这批军阀反动派已在公开宣传准备战争了。美国无线电听众民意测验，以八比二的绝对大多数主张美国撤退在华驻军，然而美驻华海军总司令柯克则公开声明美海军及其陆战队要无限期的留在中国。美国与蒋介石政府的所谓“剩余物资”的买卖，在全中国人民反对之下，竟成功了罪恶的交易。美国政府的对华政策，正由赫尔利去职后的两面政策，回向赫尔利的公开助蒋反共、反人民、反民主的一面政策，难道还不明白么？美国政府如此努力把中国殖民地化，如此慷慨帮助蒋介石打内战，还要不承认全中国内战，不承认调解失败，不愿撤退驻华军队，除了深刻的留下一个奸滑的印象外，还有什么作用呢？
    美国垄断资本和军阀、这批有钱有势的帝国主义者要打第三次世界大战，要把日本和中国作为进行战争的庞大军事基地，这个方针是确定了的。因此，其对华政策是确定了要扶植蒋介石的腐败透了的独裁政府。而蒋介石的独裁政府据他们自己说，是一定要打内战才能维持，不打内战蒋介石就怕“拖垮”。换句话说，就是怕人民要求民主；民主了，就要清算蒋介石集团无数量的罪恶；而蒋介石集团的罪恶是太多了，蒋介石连其罪恶的万分之一都赔偿不起。这就是为什么蒋介石非打内战不可，而美国的援蒋又除了帮助其打内战以外再无别的意义。
    所以我们必须明了，只要一天反动派还在美国有势力，还足以有力量过问中国的事情，那么内战就不会停下来；即使停下来，也只是新的内战的准备时期，像今年一月以后的情形那样。
    第二，我们胜利的基本保证在那里？中国人民有许多有利的条件，但其基本保证则在于解放区的存在，在于八路军、新四军的强大，在于解放区实行耕者有其田。以上三个基本保证，第一件是大家很早就明了的；第二件，解放区内外曾经有人不明了，例如在政治协商会议以后，有些民主人士以为中共应在军事方面更多让步，可是现在这个问题也会有更多人明了了；第三件，不明了的人在解放区以外的民主人士中较多一些，所以应该再行说明。
    耕者有其田的实现，为什么是人民胜利的基本保证呢？因为没有它，就没有什么解放区，也没有八路军、新四军的强大。中国人民民主解放运动已经一百余年，许多次都失败了，失败的原因在那里呢？在于这些运动虽然是人民的运动，而且其目的在于解放人民，但是还只是人民中少数人的运动，与人民百分之八十的农民没有关系，或关系不密切，广大的农民仍然在帝国主义与封建势力的压迫与欺骗之下被迫武装起来或走上战场来反对革命，于是这种运动虽然很好，却像没有生根的浮萍一样，是不坚实的，是当不起大风暴的，是只能轰轰烈烈一时，但是在帝国主义与封建势力的一两个严重打击之下，就会坍台了。只有实行耕者有其田，真正解放了农民，然后人民的解放运动就有了根，就像苍松古柏一样，在狂风暴雨中不会动摇，那怕什么帝国主义、什么封建势力、什么美国武器，都没有办法来消灭它。解放区的农民，在抗战期间曾经三次要求实行耕者有其田，抗战胜利后第四次提出这个要求，中共中央同意这次农民的正当要求，同时对于地主的生活及回到解放区的地主的生活给以保证。正是这个耕者有其田的运动，把解放区人民解放军大大的巩固和加强了，解放区军民能以较坏的武器歼灭由美国用新式武器装备起来的蒋介石军。向使中共方面不答应农民实现耕者有其田的要求，而蒋介石却得到了美国帝国主义者的外援，那么在蒋介石发动的此次内战中，中国人民的独立和平民主运动，不是没有可能像在一九二七年那样遭到失败的。
    第三，我们绝不要骄傲，绝不要轻敌，绝不要有“速胜论”的幻想。诚然，蒋介石那边有军心厌战、民心反对、经济危机三个致命的弱点，解放区方面则在这三个问题上都是与之相反，这是有利的方面。但是，另一方面，蒋介石有一个强大的帝国主义的外援，而中国人民则只有世界人民和美国人民舆论的外援，因此蒋军有较好的武器，这就使战争极其残酷，战场上争取胜利要付出很大的代价，战役、战斗的指挥一不小心，就要吃亏。因此，蒋介石可以借美国的经济帮助进行其军队的补充，敢于孤注一掷，而且敢于声言要打一年仗：“看我一年之内消灭共产党”。如果我们设想得更远些，这次战争还可以不止一年，而且由于有美国源源不断的接济，蒋介石即使停战了，新的战争又会爆发。
    由于这种情形，中国人民在此次战争中，绝对不应轻敌，尤其是打了胜仗的队伍，千万不可以骄傲起来。指挥军队的将领，特别在胜利之后，千万不要有任何疏忽大意，每一战役必须经过慎密周详的考虑与准备。应知蒋介石有了美国的输血，还是有力量的；应知蒋军已经占领了解放区若干地方，包括承德在内，要把这些地方收复，还要经过苦斗；应知蒋介石还在把战火蔓延到全国去，除了中原、苏中和冀鲁豫以外，还有苏北、鲁南、胶济、热河、冀东、晋南、绥远等战事都已发动，东北和其他地区的战事，则很快就要发动。
    但是不管怎样，中国人民与解放区军民总是要胜利的，一切中外反动派的总弱点，就是他们政治上的反动性。任何势力只要是反动的，不管它怎样强大，它一定要倒下去：反动的清朝不是倒了吗？反动的袁世凯与北洋军阀不是倒了吗？反动的希特勒、墨索里尼与日本帝国主义不是倒了吗？这些反动派在他们当权时，曾经是“强大”的，但这只是暂时的、表面的强大，实际上因为他们的反动性，即是说脱离人民，他们的政治生命早已完结了，迟早被风一吹就要倒下来的。果然，历史上一切反动派通通倒掉了，能够生长、壮大与永远延续其生命的，只有人民的进步力量。现在的反动派，不管是中国的、外国的，不管他们手里握有怎样“强大”的武力、财力，总之必倒无疑。这原因就是因为中外反动派要压迫中外的广大人民，势必引起中外广大人民起来和他们作坚决的斗争，而结果必然是反动派倒下去。我们中国人民与中国解放区的自卫战争之所以必然要胜利，就是因为我们事业的进步性，因而一切正义都在我们方面，我们所走的道路尽管迂回曲折，但是一定会走到目的地。
