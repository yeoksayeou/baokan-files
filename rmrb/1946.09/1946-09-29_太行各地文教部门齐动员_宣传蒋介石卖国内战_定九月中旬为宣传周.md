　　Taihang Local Cultural and Educational Departments Mobilize
　　Publicizing Chiang Kai-shek's Selling Out the Country and Waging Civil War
　　Mid-September Designated as Propaganda Week
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi, 27th Dispatch] The cultural and educational departments in various parts of Taihang are actively launching a propaganda campaign against Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and waging civil war. Zuoquan County has decided that mid-September will be designated as the Patriotic Self-Defense War Propaganda Week. Cadres from various agencies and Zuoquan Middle School have organized propaganda teams to carry out propaganda within the city, while rural primary schools are responsible for the villages. The Education Section has printed more than ten kinds of propaganda materials, including anti-civil war teaching materials, ditties, and clapperdaws. The mass blackboard, the folk education center, and the broadcasting station are also actively participating in this movement. The Vanguard Drama Troupe of the Taihang Military Region is conducting patriotic self-defense propaganda in巡回公演s across various regions. The troupe has painted many maps of the national situation and various battlefields, and they explain the situation of the patriotic self-defense war with the help of the maps while performing in the countryside, which is very popular among the masses. More than 30 students from Zhangbin Middle School have organized nine propaganda groups, using methods such as theatrical performances, street talks, and casual chatting to carry out current affairs propaganda, so that the masses can more clearly understand the reactionary faces of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. They also use examples of current victories to illustrate the strength of the Eighth Route Army, boost the masses' confidence in victory, and mobilize the masses to actively participate in the patriotic self-defense war.
            Shandong Primary School Teachers Increase by One and a Half Times
    In the three districts of Jiaodong, Bohai, and Binhai, the number of primary and secondary school teachers has increased from 13,900 to 35,800 in the past year. This shows that a large number of intellectuals are participating in democratic education work. Mr. Ma Jiukui, a physics and chemistry teacher at Hongwen Middle School in Putai County, voluntarily went to the Administrative Office to request work and was hired as a researcher at the Administrative Office's chemical laboratory. Mr. Yan Fei, a teacher at Guangrao No. 3 Middle School, who used to not care about politics, has also participated in village cadre meetings to serve his village under the influence of democratic life in the past six months.

　　太行各地文教部门齐动员
　　宣传蒋介石卖国内战
　　定九月中旬为宣传周
    【本报长治二十七日电】太行各地文教部门积极展开反对蒋介石卖国内战的宣传运动。左权县决定九月中旬为爱国自卫战争宣传周，各机关干部，左权中学，均组织宣传队在城内宣传，四乡则由乡村小学负责。教育科印发反内战教材及小调快板等宣传品十余种，大众黑板与民教馆、广播台亦积极参加这一运动。太行军区先锋剧团在各地巡回公演中进行爱国自卫宣传。该团绘有全国形势图及各战场地图多幅，在农村一面演戏一面按图讲解爱国自卫战争形势，颇受群众欢迎。漳滨中学学生三十余人，分别组织九个宣传小组，用化装表演使街头讲说、随时闲扯等方法进行时事宣传，使群众更清楚的了解蒋介石与美帝国主义的反动面目。并以目前打胜仗的例子，说明八路军的力量，鼓舞群众胜利信心，动员群众积极参加爱国自卫战争。
            山东小学教员激增一倍半
    胶东、渤海、滨海三个区，中小学教员一年来由一万三千九百人增至三万五千八百人。这说明知识分子大批参加民主教育工作。蒲台县宏文中学理化教员马九逵先生，自动到行署要求工作，被聘为行署化学实验室研究员。广饶三中教员延飞老先生，素不问政治，半年来在民主生活影响下，也参加了村干部会为本村服务。
