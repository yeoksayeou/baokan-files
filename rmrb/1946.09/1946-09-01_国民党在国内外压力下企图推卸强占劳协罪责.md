Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th – Under pressure from domestic and international public opinion, the Kuomintang authorities are busy attempting to shirk their responsibility for forcibly seizing the Chongqing Labor Association (劳协) organization. According to a Central News Agency report on the 28th, the Chongqing Local Court has accepted the Labor Association case. The pro-Kuomintang "Chongqing General Labor Union" has agreed to hand over the Labor Association's facilities, but they will still be under the so-called "autonomous organization" "guardianship" appointed by the Chongqing Municipal Government. The agency also issued a "transparently false denial" type of statement: "The Labor Association's facilities in Chongqing are actually a dispute between organizations and have no political function whatsoever."

　　国民党在国内外压力下企图推卸强占劳协罪责
    【新华社延安二十九日电】在国内外舆论压力下，国民党当局忙于企图推卸其强占渝劳协机构之罪责。据中央社二十八日消息：渝地方法院已受处劳协案，御用的“重庆总工会”已允将劳协机构交出，惟仍由渝市府委派所谓“自治团体”“看管”。该社并发表“此地无银三百两”式之声明：“劳协在渝机构实为团体与团体之纠纷，并无丝毫政治作用。”
