　　Chiang Kai-shek's Spies Infiltrate to Plant Insiders
    Tangyin Captures Important Criminals
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] On the 12th, Tangyin District One captured a spy, Shen Guozhu, who had infiltrated our district. According to his confession, for the past half month, the Kuomintang army in Tangyin city has been training large numbers of male and female spies, disguised as peddlers, hawkers, and doctors, to infiltrate our district for reconnaissance. They are also poisoning places everywhere. Spies disguised as doctors are even staying long-term in villages under the pretext of practicing medicine, planting insiders, creating rumors, and sabotaging mass movements. The criminal confessed that he had already poisoned the villages of Xiakou and Anshang since entering our district. Near Jingxing, Sunjiazhuang also recently captured a sixteen-year-old child, Ma Jianting, sent by the stubborn elements and puppets to our district for reconnaissance. He confessed that the puppet troops stationed in Meizhuang, in that county, are training large numbers of children aged ten to sixteen, sending them to our district in shifts, carrying poison with them. The stubborn police's Fifth Precinct is also training in Zhangcun and Hengkou. The Yan puppet troops stationed in Zhaocun, Yuci, have also recently trained a large number of female spies to infiltrate our district, seduce cadres and militiamen, and engage in assassinations of our personnel. This warrants strict attention from all localities.
