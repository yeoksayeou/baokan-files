(This dispatch from our newspaper's Ho Tse [Heze] Office, 9th.) Officers of the KMT (Kuomintang) army's 3rd Division (originally the 10th Army), a direct line division under Chiang Kai-shek, who laid down their weapons, praised to our newspaper's front-line reporter the swiftness and valor of our army's counter-attack, which was beyond their expectations. Li Zhichun, the machine gun second company commander of the eighth regiment of the third brigade of the division, said: "It was dark, and we were shooting our guns and cannons, but we couldn't hear any movement from you. When we realized it, you were already upon us. A barrage of grenades and bayonets flashed before our eyes, and there was no time to return fire, so I and everyone else were anxious and had to lay down our guns." He Xuewen said: "We didn't come to fight, we came to deliver guns and ammunition to you. The Japanese were so fierce that they would run when they saw the Eighth Route Army. Coming here is just suicide!" They said that the division departed from the front line of the siege of Li Xiannian's forces in southern Shaanxi on August 7th, rushing east overnight, but they dared not announce to the soldiers that they were going to fight the Eighth Route Army. Many people, after arriving at Baimaoji in Kaocheng, felt weak all over when they heard that the forces ahead were Liu Bocheng's main force of the Eighth Route Army. They complained that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war had backfired. Liu Fulin, the regimental commander of the eighth regiment, said: "We were ordered to besiege Li Xiannian, but we failed and suffered great losses instead. My regiment's second battalion, fourth company, was completely annihilated near Zhulingguan in Shanyang County, southern Shaanxi, and only a battalion commander ran back. I was given the punishment of demotion but allowed to remain in my post." Platoon leader Liu Yanrong said: "Besieging the New Fourth Army resulted in such a tragic outcome. Now we are coming to fight the Eighth Route Army, and even the division commander has been captured alive. What's the point of fighting!"

　　整三师放下武器军官
    佩服我军作战迅速勇猛
    【本报荷泽九日电】进犯军蒋军嫡系整三师（原第十军）放下武器的军官，对本社前线记者盛赞我军此次反击作战迅速勇猛，为他们意料所不及。该师三旅八团机枪第二连连长李之春说：“天黑了，我们打枪打炮，一点也听不到你们的动静，等到发现时，你们已到了跟前，一阵手榴弹和刺刀幌到眼边，还枪也来不及了，所以我和大家着急，只好全连放下了枪。”何学文说：“我们不是来打仗的，是来给你们送枪弹的，日本人那么凶见了八路军都要跑哩，我们来还不是送死！”他们说：该师在八月七日从陕南围攻李先念部的前线出发，星夜东赶，但一直不敢向士兵宣布去打八路军。许多人到考城白茅集之后，听到前面是八路军刘伯承的主力，混身都软了。他们埋怨蒋介石打内战弄巧成拙，八团团长刘福林说：“我们奉命围攻李先念没有围住，反而受了很大损失，我这团二营四连，在陕南山阳县属竹林关附近全连被歼灭，只跑回了一个营长，我受到撤职留任的处分。”排长刘燕荣说：“围新四军就围了个这样悲惨结果，现在来打八路军，就连师长都被活捉过来了，这还打个啥！”
