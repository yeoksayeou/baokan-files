　　Government Loans Help Organize Labor Exchange Between People and Livestock
　　Chabei Grasslands Restore “Green Manure”
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 26th] With the help of the democratic government, farmers in the Chabei grasslands have restored "green manure" practices. The grasslands there are vast and sparsely populated. Farmers have traditionally left some cultivated land fallow for several years. After the soil fertility is restored, they plow the green grass back into the soil, and then sow seeds in the following spring. This is known as "green manure land." During the enemy and puppet regime period, due to the looting of savings, the "green manure" practice was abandoned for a long time. Now, because the Chabei Democratic Government continuously provided loans of 4,200 large shi of grain for plowing livestock and agricultural implements this spring, and another 60 million border currency (equivalent to 120 million legal currency), and helped 104 villages such as Zhangbei, Baochang, and Duolun to organize over 1,200 labor exchange teams with 9,192 laborers and 5,204 head of plowing livestock, according to incomplete statistics, Kangbao's nine districts have already used "green manure" on more than 253,900 mu, Xinghe's twenty-five villages have increased "green manure" land by more than 21,000 mu, and Zhangbei's four districts have also reached more than 5,000 mu. Many households lacking livestock and farm tools also exchange manual labor for livestock labor to expand cultivated land and improve the soil. For example, in Xinghe's Taobuyao, Daxixiangzhuang and other villages, labor exchange between people and livestock was organized, and "green manure" was used on more than 3,000 to 4,000 mu. Farmers in Kangbao's Tunken, Xijing, and Bapeng villages, who have been liberated, have also organized more than sixty head of cattle plows and used "green manure" on more than 1,200 mu, which they gave to poorer farmers to help revitalize their families. Generally, "green manure" land is very fertile and can be planted with wheat and millet, with a yield of more than five large dou per mu.

　　政府贷款帮助人畜组织变工
　　察北草原恢复“压青”
    【新华社宣化二十六日电】经过民主政府帮助，察北草原农民已恢复“压青”。该地草原辽阔，人烟稀疏，农民均习惯将部分耕地荒遗数年，待地力恢复后，再将青草用犁翻过，于来春进行播种，此即所谓“压青地”。敌伪统治时期，因储蓄被掠，“压青”久废，现因今年春季察北民主政府连续举办耕畜农具等贷粮四千二百大石，另款六千万元边币（合法币一万二千万元），并帮助张北、宝昌、多伦等一百零四个村庄组织起拥有九千一百九十二个劳动力，五千二百零四头耕畜的变工队一千二百余个，据不完全统计，康保九个区已“压青”二十五万三千九百余亩，兴和二十五个村增加“压青”地二万一千余亩，张北四区亦达五千余亩。许多缺乏牲畜农户，亦以人力换取畜工，扩大耕地，改良土壤。如兴和陶卜窑，大项庄等村，组织人畜力变工，“压青”均在三千至四千亩以上。康保屯垦、西井、八棚等三村翻了身的农民，并组织起牛犋六十余头，“压青”一千二百余亩，赠给较贫苦的农民，帮助振兴家务，一般“压青”地均甚肥沃，可种小麦谷子，收获量每亩可达五大斗以上。
