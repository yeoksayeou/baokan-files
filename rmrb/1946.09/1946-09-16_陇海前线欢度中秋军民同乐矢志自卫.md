[This article was] Transmitted by our correspondent Wu Xiang from the front lines of Heze: After our army annihilated the Kuomintang army's Third Division and Forty-seventh Division between Heze and Kaocheng, achieving an unprecedented great victory, they celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival in the battlefield with the people who had just been liberated from the ravages of the Kuomintang army. Our army units have been busy in recent days summarizing experiences, electing combat heroes, and model personnel. The × Regiment also test-fired newly captured American rifles (Us sppi giedbaruory) to celebrate. On Mid-Autumn Festival night, all units held dinners, fraternized with the people, and ate watermelon and mooncakes. Comrade Li Rongcun, the county chief of Qibin County, who personally led the stretchers to transport the wounded during the war, along with Li Zhongqi, the organization minister of the county party committee, rushed to a certain unit with eleven pigs, four hundred chickens, four hundred eggs, fifty catties of wine, seventy packs of cigarettes, and one hundred catties of sea salt to express their appreciation. Yan Hongyan, the deputy commander of a certain unit, thanked them on behalf of the troops and invited County Chief Li and others to dine together. During the dinner, County Chief Li said: "Qibin is a new county carved out of Kaocheng and Dingtao in memory of the anti-Japanese martyr Liu Qibin. It is the earliest birthplace of the southwestern Shandong liberated area. Now, a great victory has been won here, eliminating a large number of Kuomintang troops, and the people are especially happy." At the request of County Chief Li, Deputy Commander Yan gave some of the captured Kuomintang army guns to the local people and militiamen. Several villagers who delivered the supplies happily said: "That's great, if the Kuomintang army dares to come again, even more will be wiped out." The prisoner-of-war officer reception center of the × unit also held a dinner, and Xu Lixing went to express his greetings on behalf of the military region leaders. The officers of the Third Division and Forty-seventh Division who had laid down their arms in the center were deeply moved. Chen Yuanzhi, an adjutant of the Forty-first Division, said: "The kind treatment I have received in the past three days has made a deep impression on me. My family will be very happy if they know how I am spending the holiday here." The mass drama troupe of the Fifth Sub-district also performed in a village on the Heze front line to express their appreciation to the army.
