The Guo Haibo Guerrilla Unit Active in the Chiang Kai-shek Occupied Areas

	North of Baipu, around the Linzi and Liuqiao line for more than twenty li, there is an active "Guo Haibo Guerrilla Unit." This is a people's self-defense force that grew up after Chiang's troops occupied Baipu on January 15th this year. For more than seven months, they have successfully completed the task of defending their hometown. In June and July, they resisted the invading Chiang and puppet troops 24 times, and defeated Chiang's troops, which were several times larger than their own, seven times in Zhangfudang alone, killing or wounding 14 people, including the commander of the "Security Team." As a result, the Chiang army spread the saying, "Pass nine rivers, but not Zhangfudang." Later, on one occasion, more than 30 Chiang soldiers braced themselves and rushed to the south of the dang (a local term for a swamp or depression). When they saw people walking on the dang, they were so frightened that they asked the local people, "Are there any Guo Haibo's troops ahead?" The local people replied, "It's hard to say." The Chiang soldiers fled in panic upon hearing this.
	The local people cherish their armed forces very much and actively assisted in every self-defense battle of the Guo Haibo Guerrilla Unit. In the Battle of Guanyin Jia Road, the militiamen ran ahead to scout and lured the Chiang troops into the ambush. In the seven victorious struggles in Zhangfudang, the unit was able to calmly attack because the people supplied intelligence from different routes.
	In the eyes of the local people, the Guo Haibo Guerrilla Unit has become a banner of victory and a guarantee of safety. They all say, "With Guo Haibo here, we can sleep peacefully." The Chiang army in the Baipu area calls them "Qin Bo'er" (meaning tenacious and good at fighting).
	Captain Guo Haibo is only twenty-one years old this year, but he looks completely like an adult. When reporters asked him why his guerrilla unit could persist in fighting in the occupied areas, his answer was very simple: "Only because it is the people's armed force, protecting the people's interests and gaining the people's support."

### 活跃在蒋军侵占区的郭海波游击队

　　活跃在蒋军侵占区的郭海波游击队
    白蒲以北林梓、刘桥一线周围二十多里，活跃着一支“郭海波游击队”。这是今年一月十五日蒋军侵占白蒲后成长起来的人民自卫武装，七个多月来他们胜利的完成了保卫家乡的任务。六、七两月间，共抗击了出犯蒋伪军二十四次，在张福荡一地先后七次击败数倍于该部的蒋军，并杀伤“保安队”指挥员以下十四人。因此蒋军中流传着“过九条江，不过张福荡”。后来有一次蒋军三十余人硬着头皮冲到该荡南面，看见荡上有人走动，吓得连问老百姓：“前面可有郭海波儿的部队？”老百姓回答：“这很难说。”蒋军听了就仓皇逃走。
    当地老百姓十分爱护自己的武装，在郭海波游击队每次自卫战斗中，都踊跃助战。在观音夹路战役中，民兵跑在最前面侦察，并把蒋军诱进伏击圈内来。张福荡七次胜利斗争中，都因老百姓分路供给情报，使该部得以沉着出击。
    郭海波游击队在当地老百姓的心目中已成了胜利的旗帜和安全的保障。他们都说：“郭海波在这里，我们就敢睡个太平觉。”白蒲一带的蒋军，则称他们为“侵波儿”（顽强善战的意思）。
    郭海波队长今年才二十一岁，看上去完全像一个大人。当记者问到他的游击队为什么能在被侵占区坚持斗争时，他的回答很简单：“只因为它是人民的武装，保护人民利益，得到人民的支持。”
