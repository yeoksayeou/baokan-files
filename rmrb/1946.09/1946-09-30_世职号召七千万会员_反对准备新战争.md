　　World Federation of Trade Unions Calls on 70 Million Members
　　Oppose Preparing for a New War
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 27th: According to Associated Press and other reports from September 25th: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions recently held a quarterly meeting in Montreal, Canada, and has issued a resolution declaring that "Fascist and reactionary forces threaten world peace," and calling on "workers around the world to join hands and fight against a third world war." The resolution also called on "70 million members to inform their respective governments of their determination to oppose preparations for another world war." United Nations Secretary-General Lie addressed the committee on the 25th, urging the Allied countries to reach an agreement as soon as possible, stating: "Today is the time for the great powers to fulfill their promises and agreements. Agreements are of great importance to the future of mankind. We can make reasonable demands, that is, countries should conduct discussions in a spirit of unity to reach agreements, so as to permanently resolve all differences. The United Nations has a special right to demand that the great powers continue discussions and reach agreements as soon as possible." He pointed out, "The current international political situation is not surprising. Today's pessimistic mood stems from people's disappointment that the cooperation of the wartime allies has not continued to the end. We should not be alarmed by the emergence of differences today that did not exist during the war." It is reported that the World Federation of Trade Unions was officially established in Paris in February of this year and is a new international organization of world workers after the war.

    【新华社延安二十七日电】据美联社等二十五日讯：世界职工联盟执行委员会近在加拿大蒙特利尔召开季会，现已开会并作出决议宣称：“法西斯与反动势力威胁世界和平”，号召“全世界工人携起手来，为反对第三次世界大战而奋斗”。该决议并号召“七千万会员明告各该国政府，决心反对另一次世界大战之准备”。联合国秘书长莱氏二十五日在该委员会会上致辞，敦促盟国尽速获致协议称：“今日已值列强履行其诺言与协议之时，协议与人类之未来有极重大之关系，我们可提出合理之要求，即各国应以一致获致协议的精神，进行商讨，以永释种种异见。联合国拥有特殊权利，可要求列强继续商讨，尽速获致协议。”他指出“当前之国际政治形势，实无足惊奇，今日之悲观情调，实起于人民对战时盟国合作未能持续到底之失望。我人不应因战时未有的异见之在今日显现而表示惊慌。”按世界职工联盟于今年二月于巴黎正式成立，为战后世界职工的新的国际组织。
