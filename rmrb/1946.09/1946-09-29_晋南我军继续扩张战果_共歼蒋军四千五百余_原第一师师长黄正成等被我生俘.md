　　Our Army in Southern Shanxi Continues to Expand Victories
　　Over 4,500 Chiang Troops Annihilated
　　Former 1st Division Commander Huang Zhengcheng and Others Captured Alive

　　[Report from This Newspaper in Yangcheng, 27th] The Taiyue Military Region announced: In the Linfen-Fushan Campaign, our army continues to expand its victories. On the 19th, Chiang's troops launched an offensive against the Ta'er Mountain area on the Linfen-Fushan border and the Fushan Liberated Area. The Taiyue Eighth Route Army was forced to launch a defensive counterattack, and on the 23rd and 24th, annihilated the entire elite American-equipped 1st Brigade (formerly a division) of Hu Zongnan, except for one battalion stationed in Linfen, in the Guanque-Chenyan line (30 li east of Linfen). As a result, the Chiang troops invading Fushan completely collapsed on the afternoon of the 23rd, and Fushan City, which had been briefly invaded by Chiang's troops at 11:00 a.m. on the same day, was also recovered. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the fleeing Chiang troops along multiple routes, continuing to expand the battle results. On the evening of the 23rd, another regiment of Chiang's 78th Brigade was wiped out near Dizhen Township in Linfen County, and the 167th Brigade was also routed. In this campaign, more than 2,500 enemy troops were captured alive including Huang Zhengcheng, Brigade (formerly Division) Commander of the First Brigade, Liu Yushu, Regimental Commander of the First Regiment; over 2,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded below the rank of Regimental Commander of the Second Regiment; and the following weaponry was seized: four mountain guns, eleven light and heavy mortars, three anti-tank guns, six small cannons, twenty-seven American-style heavy machine guns, over a hundred light machine guns, over a hundred "Sten" submachine guns, over six hundred rifles, forty pistols, fourteen telephones, ammunition and other military supplies. After suffering this heavy blow, the warmonger Hu Zongnan remains unrepentant, and on the 24th, he again mobilized over 1,600 men from his 37th Division stationed in Yicheng to invade northward. At 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, they once again occupied the empty city of Fushan. The masses and militia, who had been safely evacuated to the suburbs in advance, actively cooperated with our army and launched a fierce counterattack. This invading force is destined to follow the same path as the 1st Brigade.

　　晋南我军继续扩张战果
　　共歼蒋军四千五百余
　　原第一师师长黄正成等被我生俘
    【本报阳城二十七日电】太岳军区公布：临（汾）浮（山）战役，我军继续扩大战果。十九日蒋军向临浮交界之塔儿山及浮山解放区发动攻势，太岳八路军被迫自卫反击，于二十三、四日将胡宗南精锐美械化第一旅（原师）除一个营尚在临汾驻守外，全部被我消灭于官雀、陈堰一线（临汾以东三十里）。至此，进犯浮山之蒋军，即于二十三日下午全线溃退，当日上午十一时一度被蒋军侵入之浮山城，亦告恢复，我军并乘胜分路追击溃窜之蒋军，继续扩张战果。二十三日晚，复将蒋军七十八旅一个团消灭于临汾县底镇附近，一六七旅亦被击溃。计此役生俘第一旅旅（原师）长黄正成、第一团团长刘玉树以下二千五百余人，毙伤第二团团长以下二千余人，缴获山炮四门、轻重迫击炮十一门、战防炮三门、小炮六门、美式重机枪二十七挺、轻机枪百余支、“斯登”手提机枪百余支、步枪六百余支、短枪四十支、电话机十四部、弹药及其他军用品甚多。好战分子胡宗南遭此重创后，仍执迷不悟，二十四日复于其占驻我翼城之三十七师抽集一千六百余人北犯，是日下午四时再陷我浮山空城。事先安全转移至城郊群众、民兵，主动配合我军，展开猛烈反击，此股进犯军，势将蹈第一旅之复辙。
