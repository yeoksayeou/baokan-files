Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth
    Wang Genliu

    The masses of Dinanbao, Handan, have victoriously concluded their struggle of reasoning with landlord Yang Zhenqing.

    Yang Zhenqing is from Dinanbao, Handan, and has served as a member of the Zhili Provincial Assembly, a lawyer, a county magistrate, and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. He is currently the manager of Handan Tongsheng Yinhao (Silver Shop) and one of the well-known landlords in Handan. His daughter participated in the war against Japan and is now the chief of the Education Section of the Jinnan Administrative Office.

    The reasoning conference was held on the ninth day of the seventh lunar month. More than twenty tenant farmers and long-term workers spoke with grief and indignation, from a fourteen-year-old child to a seventy-eight-year-old man, all pouring out their accumulated grievances. Cheng Zhenyuan said: The Yang family established a loan shark business during the Guangxu era and amassed eight *qing* of land in twenty years, exploiting hundreds of poor households. Hired worker Cheng Laolie described his past suffering with heartache: "I would rather starve to death than work for the Yang family. Never full, never able to sleep at noon, work in the wind, work in the rain..."

    At such a conference, the suffering of the masses was profound, and the power of the masses was great...

    After the liberation of Handan, Yang Zhenqing received much education from the cadres of the municipal government, and new books and newspapers gave him many insights. His daughter had a considerable influence on him. At this time, he also saw the power of the masses with his own eyes, and he bowed his head to the masses.

    He thanked the masses for their hospitality and education and said with great emotion:

    "After decades of wandering, I finally found the path of the people thanks to the guidance of the masses. Although I am old, I have a 'short hair but a long heart, determined to follow the people'!" He said, "One gains the country by gaining the people, and loses the country by losing the people." Emperor Gaozu of Han rose to power simply by enacting three simple laws, and quickly organized hundreds of thousands of people. Today, Chairman Mao is leading the people to stand up through better governance, and constantly regards 'separation from the masses means the revolution will not succeed' as the supreme precept. This has created a democratic bulwark and liberated the strength of 140 million people in the liberated areas."

    "Perhaps some people will say that I am a rebel against my clan. I have also used loyal words to advise relatives and friends: Today, the people are standing up, which is an inevitable path for the wheel of history. If anyone tries to 'stop a chariot with a mantis's arms,' they will eventually be defeated." He said firmly: "The tide of history will not accommodate the backward. Of course, the landlord class still cares about face and property, but as long as you remember the sentence: 'Planting land requires paying grain, owning land means becoming king,' you will fully understand how landlords oppressed the poor in the past, and that the people's uprising today is in accordance with 'heavenly principles,' 'national laws,' and 'human sentiments.' Cheng Baoni's family, in order to settle accounts and eat grain, had to sell off more than one *qing* of land and three courtyards, which is so unfair!"

    He said, "The concentration of land not only makes many people starve and restricts the development of capitalism, but also reduces the state's income. I remember one year that the income from my family's two *qing* of land was not even comparable to the Xin family's twenty *mu*. In Dinanbao, nearly half of the thirty-three *qing* of land is concentrated in the Yang family, forming a situation where 'the rich own fields stretching across the land, while the poor have no place to stand.' Land is barren, and people are starving. If Dinanbao is like this, the income of the entire country can be imagined."

    Yang Zhenqing was grateful for the leniency of the masses. He said, "Can my existing property compensate for the losses of the masses? Obviously not. However, the masses took into consideration that I was a member of the army's family and preserved the life of a rich peasant for me, leaving me with thirty-five *mu* of land. The government protects commerce and encourages capital development. The masses did not touch my shares in Tongsheng Yinhao at all. I will engrave this kindness in my heart and carry it through to my future actions and production."

    After the meeting, the cadres and villagers invited him to a banquet. Everyone at the table celebrated his rebirth, and he himself was happy and excited about this rebirth.

　　杨真卿的新生
    王根六
    邯郸堤南堡群众向地主杨真卿的说理斗争已胜利的结束了。
    杨真卿为邯郸堤南堡人，历任直隶省议员、律师、县长、商会会长等职。现为邯郸同升银号经理，为邯郸有名大地主之一。他的女儿参加抗战，现为冀南行署教育科长。
    说理大会是在七月初九进行的。二十几个佃户和长工悲愤发言，从十四岁的小孩子到七十八岁的老头子，都把自己积年的苦水倒出来了。程镇元说：杨家在光绪年间设立了放账庄，二十年中捞到八顷地，成百户的贫苦人都被他剥削光了。雇工程老烈伤心的描述自己过去的苦况：“饿死饿活，不跟杨家作活。顿顿吃不饱，中午睡不着，刮风有刮风的活，下雨有下雨的活……”
    在这样的大会上，群众的痛苦是深切的，群众的力量是伟大的………
    邯郸解放后，杨真卿受了市政府干部们许多教育，新书报给了他许多启示，他女儿对他有不少的影响，这时候他又亲眼看到了群众的力量，他向群众低头了。
    他感谢群众对他的款待和教育，非常感慨的说：
    “几十年来的奔波，终赖群众的诱导找到了人民的道路。我年虽花甲，但本“发短心长，一意跟着人民走”！他说：“得众得国、失众失国”，汉高祖起家，只凭约法三章，很快的就组织起来几十万人民。今天毛主席更化善治，领导人民翻身，且时常把“脱离群众，革命就不会成功”奉为最高戒律，如此造成了民主干城，解放区一万四千万的人民力量。
    “或许有人说我是宗族的叛逆。我也曾用忠言劝导过亲戚朋友：今天人民翻身，是历史巨轮必经的道路，倘若谁图“螳臂当车”，终久是要败灭的。”他斩钉截铁的说：“历史的潮流不会迁就落后的人，当然地主阶级中还姑息着情面和财产，但只要记起这一句：“种地要纳粮，有地变成王”就完全明白过去地主是怎样压迫穷人，而今天的人民翻身正是合乎“天理”“国法”“人情”的。程保尼家为着揭账吃粮，把一顷多地三座院子都贴光了，这是多么不平啊！”
    他说：“土地的集中岂止使许多人挨饿，限止了资本主义的发展，而且降低了国家的收入。曾记得有一年我家两顷地的收入还抵不上辛家的二十亩。堤南堡三十三顷土地，集中在杨家的几近一半，村中形成了“富者田连阡陌，穷者无立锥之地”，土地荒芜，人民饿饭，堤南堡如此，整个国家的收入就可想而知了。”
    杨真卿感激群众对他的宽大，他说：“我现有的财产能够偿还群众的损失吗？显然是不能的。但是群众顾念我是干属，给我保留了富农的生活，给我留下了卅五亩地。政府保护商业，奖励资本发展，我在同升银号的股本，群众根本没有动。我刻骨铭心，一定把群众的好意贯串到今后的行动中和生产中。”
    会后，干部和乡亲们请他吃酒饭，大家在席间庆贺他的新生，他自己也为这次新生而愉快和兴奋。
