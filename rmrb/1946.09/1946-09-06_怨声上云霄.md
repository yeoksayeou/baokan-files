　　[Dispatch from Jiaozuo from our newspaper, dated 2nd] Two letters were found in a Chiang Kai-shek fighter plane shot down by our army on the south bank of the Qin River on the 19th of last month. From these letters, it is evident that a segment of the Kuomintang air force personnel is also permeated with anti-civil war sentiment and deeply dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's special agent rule. Both letters are signed "Dbc." One, addressed to Lieutenant Ran Ruifu of the 42nd Squadron, 11th Air Force Group, states:

　　“Next month, I will be sent to Xuzhou. My leave of absence still requires a letter from home as proof. Currently, I don't know how to proceed. In short, who is willing to kill against their conscience? It's only limited by orders, and I can only sigh helplessly!”

　　The other letter, addressed to Xue Qiwen of Jiangsu Education Institute, states:

　　“Currently, the political and military negotiations, according to general opinion, are not optimistic. Will this forced agreement from the Four Foreign Ministers' meeting alleviate the tension between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? Indeed, everyone is unwilling to continue fighting. Especially the common people, if the fighting continues, everyone will be unable to survive! Currently, the social order in Nanjing and Shanghai is very bad. Open robbery and kidnapping occur in the streets and alleys. People also have the 'camouflage' that animals should have. When it reaches a certain limit, they will abandon their 'camouflage' and take risks.”

　　“Around the 16th of last month, people's representatives and student representatives from Shanghai went to Nanjing to petition for 'peace'. The people cannot withstand any more war. They were brutally beaten by thugs in Xiaguan, and news reporters also suffered. The beating trend has spread from Jiaochangkou Cangbaitang to Nanjing! Alas! The future of the motherland is too disheartening. The entire China is governed by thugs. Social elites are treated like this, so what about the common people? I will return to Nanjing in a week, residing at No. 1, Taiping Road, Zhutao Yuanyuan New Village.

　　Jiemin has not sent a letter yet, which is worrying. Please pass on this message and wish him good health.

　　怨声上云霄
    【本报焦作二日电】我军在上月十九日于沁河南岸击落的一架蒋记驱逐机中检到书信两封，从中看到国民党一部分空军人员亦弥漫着反内战情绪，并对国民党的特务统治深为不满。两信均署名“Ｄbc”，在致空军第十一大队四十二中队冉瑞甫中尉的一封中写道：
    “下月我被派去徐州，我的请假，还待家信来作证，目前我不晓的怎样办理？一句话，背着良心杀人，谁愿意呢？只是限于命令，只有徒呼奈何！”
    另一封寄江苏教育学院薛奇文，中道：
    “目前政治军事谈判，据一般看法，未可使人乐观，是否这一次四外长会议的勉强协议会缓和国共之间的紧张局面呢？诚然大家都不愿再打下去。尤其是老百姓，再打下去大家都活不了呀！目前京沪的社会秩序很坏，大街小巷，公开的抢案、绑票。人也有动物应具有的‘保护色’，到了一定的限度，他也要放弃‘保护色’挺而走险了。”
    “上月十六号左右，上海人民代表及学生代表赴京请愿，请求‘和平’，人民经不起再战了。在下关遭打手的毒打，新闻记者也遭了殃。打风由较场口沧白堂又带到南京来了，呵！祖国的前途，太令人不能乐观了，整个的中国由打手们来主持。社会贤达尚且如此，那小百姓还得了吗？我一礼拜后，返南京，住京太平路，竺桥桃原新村一号。
    介民仍未来信，急坏人，请代转此意祝健康
                                                      八月七日”
