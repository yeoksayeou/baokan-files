　　Alert! Alert!
    Strictly Prevent Guomindang Secret Agents from Disrupting the Rear
    [Reported from Heze on the 1st of this month] As we are intensely carrying out our self-defense war and most of the militia have departed for the front lines, Guomindang secret agents in the areas of Juancheng and Qihe are greatly active in our rear, sabotaging war service work. In Lao Ji Village, Third District of Juancheng, when a mass meeting was being held, four bad elements secretly convened a meeting, preparing to carry out sabotage. They were discovered by our militia and sent to the district for handling. The Kuomintang dispatched a large number of secret agents into our area in Qihe. On the 5th, when we were mobilizing the masses in the bordering area, Guomindang secret agents immediately rushed to the Xiaotun area to fire shots and cause disturbances, affecting the progress of our mobilization work. They also spread rumors saying, "How many people have the Eighth Route Army died in the front?" etc. Now our local government has paid close attention to this, and the Third District of Juancheng has especially strengthened its sentry posts, so that the secret agents have no room for activity.

    严防国特扰乱后方
    【本报荷泽一日讯】在我紧张进行自卫战争大部民兵出发前线之际，鄄城、齐河两地国特在我后方大肆活动，破坏战勤工作。鄄城三区老冀庄在开群众大会时，有四个坏蛋偷偷开会，准备进行破坏，被我民兵发觉送区上处理。齐河国民党派出大批特务进入我区。五日我往边沿区动员民众时，国特即在萧屯一带赶来放枪扰乱，影响我动员工作之进行。并大肆造谣说：“八路军在前方死了多少人”等等。现我当地政府已严予注意，鄄城三区特别加紧岗哨，使特务无活动余地。
