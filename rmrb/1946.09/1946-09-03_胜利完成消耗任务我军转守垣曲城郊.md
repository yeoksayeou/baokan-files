　　Having Successfully Completed Attrition Task, Our Army Shifts to Defend Suburbs of Yuanqu
　　[Our Newspaper Yangcheng Dispatch, 29th] Chiang's troops, advancing south along the Jiang-Yuan Highway, and those advancing east from Wenxi and Xiaxian, converged at Gaoluo on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, they continued their southward advance towards Wangmao Town, northwest of Yuanqu County, and launched a fierce attack on Yuanqu County seat with air support. At 3 PM, our defending troops, having successfully completed their attrition task, strategically withdrew to new positions in the suburbs of the city. Combining with local armed forces and militia, they continue to strike at the enemy. Chiang's troops have stretched their battle lines, and their forces are dispersed, making them vulnerable to annihilation at any time. Note: Yuanqu County was handed over to the Japanese invaders by Chiang Kai-shek during the War of Resistance against Japan, and was liberated by the Eighth Route Army on August 29th last year.
　　[Our Newspaper Tongpu Frontline Dispatch, 29th] Chiang's troops of the 30th Division (formerly the 30th Army), which invaded our Jiangxian liberated area, are advancing south along the Jiang (Xian)-Yuan (Qu) Highway, and on the 26th, captured Gaoluo Town in Yuanqu. At the same time, Chiang's troops stationed in Wenxi and Xiaxian launched a three-pronged attack on our Zhongtiao Mountain area, attempting to encircle and annihilate our defending troops at Majiamiao, 50 li northeast of Xiaxian. After failing to find them, they turned south and captured Zhujiazhuang, southwest of Gaoluo Town, on the afternoon of the 26th. Fierce fighting is now unfolding in the vicinity of Xifeng Mountain and Qingchu Village, north of Yuanqu City. Furthermore, around Nancun, Rencun, and Bancun on the south bank of the Yellow River, Chiang's troops from the 27th Division suddenly dispatched a regiment from Mianchi on the 24th, appearing to be preparing to cross the river and invade northwards. The soldiers and civilians of Yuanqu County have now been urgently mobilized, determined to inflict a major blow on the invading troops.

　　胜利完成消耗任务我军转守垣曲城郊
    【本报阳城二十九日电】沿绛垣公路南犯与自闻喜、夏县东犯两路蒋军，二十六日在皋落会合后，二十七日晨继续南犯垣曲城西北之王茅镇，并以飞机配合猛犯我垣曲县城。午后三时，我守军胜利完成消耗任务后，机动撤至城郊新阵地，结合地方武装及民兵，继续打击敌人，蒋军战线拉长，兵力分散，随时均有被歼可能。按：垣曲县城系蒋介石在抗日战争中拱手让与日寇，去年八月二十九日为八路军解放。
    【本报同蒲前线二十九日电】侵陷我绛县解放区之蒋军三十师（原三十军）正沿绛（县）垣（曲）公路南犯，二十六日，陷我垣曲皋落镇。与此同时，驻闻喜、夏县之蒋军，三路进犯我中条山地区，企图合击夏县东北五十里马家庙我守军。扑空后乃转向南犯，二十六日午后陷皋落镇西南之朱家庄，现激战正在其附近之西峰山、垣曲城北之青厨村一带展开。又、黄河南岸南村、任村、班村一带，二十四日突由渑池增调来蒋军二十七师一个团，有渡河北犯模样。垣曲全县军民现已紧急动员起来，决予进犯军以重大打击。
