　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Recently, American military police in Shanghai have been privately selling weapons and extorting money. According to a special dispatch from the Chengdu New People's Evening News in Shanghai on August 15th: An American military policeman named Lamont recently went to an embroidery shop to sell a pistol he was carrying. The shop owner was not present at the time, and the clerk dared not accept it. The American soldier loaded the gun with bullets and threatened him. Later, the shop owner returned and, fearing trouble, gave him 40,000 yuan. After receiving the money, the American soldier left the gun and left. After a while, the soldier returned to the embroidery shop and declared "confiscation of stolen goods." As a result, the shop was charged by the authorities with illegally possessing military supplies.

　　上海美兵敲诈商民
    【新华社延安七日电】日来美宪兵在沪时有私售武器及敲诈勒索情事发生。据成都新民晚报上海八月十五日专电载：日前有美宪兵兰蒙特者，以所佩手枪一枝往一绣花店出售，当时店主不在，店员不敢收受，该美兵竟将子弹上膛，加以威吓。后店主归来，恐招是非，即予四万元，美兵得款之后，留枪即去。移时，该兵复回绣花店，声言“抄脏”。结果，该店竟被当局以私藏军火论罪。
