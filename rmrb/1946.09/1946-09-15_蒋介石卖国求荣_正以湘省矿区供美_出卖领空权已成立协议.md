　　Chiang Kai-shek Sells Out the Country for Personal Glory
    Supplying U.S. with Hunan Province Mining Areas
    Agreement to Sell Airspace Rights Already Established
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: According to the Peiping Xinmin Daily, Nanking dispatch of August 21st: When the former U.S. Air Force 14th Air Fleet was stationed in Jieguan (northern Guangdong, located on the Yuehan Railway line) and Shaoyang (central Hunan, located on the Hunan-Guizhou Highway), they were very “attached” to the rich mineral resources and beautiful scenery there. Recently, they specifically requested the Kuomintang government to designate these two locations as industrial zones. If approved, the U.S. would ship various machinery to Shaoyang. According to the fleet, the Kuomintang authorities are currently in negotiations with the U.S. side regarding detailed measures.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Shanghai News: The long-brewing deal of the Chiang government selling airspace rights – selling rights to Chennault to establish the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Air Transport Brigade – was officially announced by Mr. Lattre, a senior American employee of CNRRA, on the 30th of last month, the day before the signing of the contract to sell remaining materials. He stated that the contract had been approved by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan. Lattre also said that the mission of the Air Transport Brigade, in addition to transporting so-called CNRRA materials, would also include transporting commercial goods. This brigade includes twelve aircraft and air transport equipment worth 30 million U.S. dollars. Although it uses the name of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, it is directly named the Chennault Air Transport Corporation. According to plans under the name of CNRRA, the Chiang Kai-shek government plans to sell three major transportation powers to the United States: the sale of inland waterway navigation rights and the CNRRA Water Transport Team (including nearly 300,000 tons of ships) has long been a reality; airspace rights and the air transport company are the second transaction; and the CNRRA Land Transport Team is the third which is being actively promoted.

　　蒋介石卖国求荣
    正以湘省矿区供美
    出卖领空权已成立协议
    【新华社延安十二日电】据北平新民报八月二十一日南京专电：前驻华美空军第十四航空队驻旆节关（粤北位于粤汉线上）、邵阳（湘中位湘黔公路线上）两地时，对该处矿产丰富、风景宜人，甚为“留恋”，近特向国民党政府要求将该两地辟工业区，如获许可，即由美起运各项机械来韶。据该队透露：国民党当局正在与美方洽商详细办法中。
    【新华社延安十日电】沪讯：酝酿已久之蒋政府出卖领空权买卖之一——售权于陈纳德成立行总空运大队一事，已于上月三十日在让售剩余物资的合约签订的前一日，由行总高级职员美人来特正式宣布合同的订立，并称已经国民党行政院批准。来特又谓：该空运大队的任务，除运输所谓行总物资外，并将兼运商货。这个大队包括飞机十二架，及价值三百万万美金之空运设备，虽用了行政院救济总署的名义，但却直接命名为陈纳德空中运输公司。按在行总名义下，蒋介石政府计划出卖交通大权于美国者有三：内河航行权的出卖及行总水运队（包括船只近三十万吨）早已成为事实，领空权及空运公司为第二项买卖，正在积极策进的尚有行总陆运大队。
