　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd: The spokesman for the CCP delegation here issued a statement regarding US Under Secretary of the Army Patterson's statement on the 27th: Mr. Patterson's statement essentially confirms that the US government is once again using material aid to assist the Nanjing government in its civil war. This measure, undertaken when the people of the entire world and all of China are resolutely opposing the Chinese civil war, makes its actual significance even more serious. We are not greatly interested in Mr. Patterson's explanation of what constitutes these materials. The so-called non-purely military supplies that the US government is selling to the Nanjing government will not be a batch of consumables, but trucks, communications and transportation equipment, and other military supplies, which are precisely what the Chiang army urgently needs in today's civil war. The important thing is that Mr. Patterson has openly acknowledged this secret negotiation. This serious fact has the following significance: First, the US government is bound to implement its policy of unilateral support for the Nanjing government in its civil war at all costs. Second, the US government is openly challenging Chinese democrats and democratic parties, ignoring the wishes of the Chinese people and the people of the world to stop the Chinese civil war, and is acting obstinately. The first thing we must declare is that we absolutely do not recognize this secret negotiation or any agreement that may arise from it, and we bear no responsibility for it. We unhesitatingly point out that if the US government does not immediately stop this kind of consultation, then the US government shall bear the responsibility for all the serious consequences arising from this secret consultation.

　　The spokesman continued: We welcome a fair US aid-to-China policy and the sincere cooperation between the Chinese and American people and efforts for the grand plan and undertaking of building an industrialized China; but unfortunately, it seems today that this pleasant wish has been overshadowed by the Chinese civil war, and the US government is now unilaterally supporting the Kuomintang fascists in their civil war of slaughtering the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, we can only resolutely oppose this erroneous policy of the US government with the same high degree of enthusiasm with which we welcome Sino-US cooperation. The Xinhua News Agency reporter finally asked if there were any thoughts on Mr. Peng Xuepei's statement the other day? The spokesman said: Peng Xuepei said that this news was a "childish and absurd" "rumor." One of the parties involved—Mr. Patterson—has now directly affirmed that this is an ironclad fact, and as for the so-called "civil aviation agreement," may I ask if there is anything other than forfeiting China's airspace rights? The so-called "childish and absurd" is precisely what Peng Xuepei himself said.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd: US Under Secretary of the Army Patterson and US Liquidation Commissioner's Special Assistant McKay issued a statement at the US Consulate General in Shanghai on the 27th, admitting that they are negotiating to sell surplus materials to the Kuomintang government, saying that the total value of these materials currently stored in the Western Pacific is 500 million US dollars, but denying that there are munitions (purely military supplies) in the materials. The statement also stated that the negotiation on the sale of surplus materials did not involve the issue of Chinese civil aviation rights, and that the negotiation on the civil aviation agreement is being conducted by Mr. Powell, the representative of the US State Department. The nature of this agreement is the same as the civil aviation agreement concluded with eighteen countries. He further said that although Mr. Powell came to China on the same plane as him, he was definitely not a member of the surplus materials delegation.

　　彼特森声明赤裸暴露
    美不顾一切助蒋内战
    中共代表团声明坚决反对
    【新华社南京二日电】此间中共代表团发言人对于美陆次彼特森二十七日的声明发表声明：彼特森氏之声明实质上已肯定美国政府又一次的用物资援助方式去援助南京政府进行内战，此种措施，适于全世界全中国人民坚决反对中国内战时为之，则其实际意义更加严重。彼特森氏对其物资作何解释，吾人不感觉重大兴趣，美政府所让售与南京政府所谓非纯粹军用品之物资，但不会是一批消耗品，而为卡车通讯与运输器材及其他军用品，而此等物资，适为蒋军在今日内战中所急需者。重要之事为彼特森氏业将此秘密谈判予以公开承认，此严重事实，有如下之意义：第一、美国政府势将不顾一切贯彻其片面支援南京政府进行内战之政策。第二、美国政府不惜向中国民主人士及民主党派公开挑战，忽视中国人民与世界人民要求停止中国内战之愿望，而一意孤行。吾人首先必须声明者，即吾人绝对不承认此种秘密商谈及其行将产生之任何协议，并对之不负任何责任。吾人毫不犹豫指出：美国政府若不立即停止此种有关协商，则此种秘密商谈及其所产生之一切严重后果当由美国政府担负应负责任。
    发言人继称：吾人欢迎公正之美国援华政策与中美人民之诚挚合作与为建设工业化中国之远大计划与事业而努力；但不幸得很，在今日看来，此种愉快之愿望，竟为中国内战所笼罩而不得实现，而美国政府现又片面支援国民党法西斯派屠杀中国人民之内战。在此种情形下，吾人只能以欢迎中美合作之同样高度的热烈性去坚决反对美国政府这种错误政策。新华社记者最后询以对日前彭学沛氏声明有何感想？发言人称：彭学沛谓此消息乃“幼稚与荒唐”之“造谣”，当事人之一——彼特森氏现已直截了当肯定此为铁的事实，而所谓“民航协定”云云，请问除断送中国领空权而外，尚有其他否。所谓“幼稚与荒唐”，乃彭学沛氏自身发言之谓也。
    【新华社南京二日电】美国陆次彼特森及美国清理专员特别帮办麦凯，于二十七日在上海美总领署发表声明，承认正在谈判以剩余物资售与国民党政府，谓是项物资现藏于西太平洋，总价值为五万万美元，但否认物资内有军火（纯粹军用品）。该声明又称：出售剩余物资谈判，未涉及中国民用航空权问题，而有关民航协定之谈判，正由美国国务院代表鲍威尔进行中，是项协定性质与十八国订立之民航协定相同。复谓鲍氏虽与彼同机来华，但确非剩余物资代表团之团员。
