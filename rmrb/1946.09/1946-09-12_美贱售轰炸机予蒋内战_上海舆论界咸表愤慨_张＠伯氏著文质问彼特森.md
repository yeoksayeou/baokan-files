Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai report: The scandalous transaction of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission's Shanghai office secretly selling 150 bombers to the Kuomintang government two months ago was exposed by the Associated Press's China branch last month on the 27th. According to the reporter's report, all the bombers were "B-25" type, including eleven "B-25" type Mitchell heavy bombers. These 150 aircraft were originally worth several million US dollars, but were sold to the Kuomintang government for only 500,000 US dollars, averaging only 3,000 US dollars per aircraft, the cost of a Jeep. This fact was also confirmed by a person in charge of the Kuomintang Central Aviation Corporation Management Office. According to McCaby, Director of the US Liquidation Commission, the aircraft were sold to the China National Aviation Corporation as scrap parts. However, Qin Meng, manager of the China National Aviation Corporation, told the Associated Press reporter, "These aircraft cannot be regarded as old, because they can still fly for 3,000 hours and were manufactured in the later stages of the war." According to Air Force officers inspecting the aircraft, "All the aircraft can be used for bombing, and none of the machine guns and bomb racks and other military equipment have been removed." This proves that the so-called "scrap parts" is purely a lie. After this inside story was revealed, all Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai competed to publish it, and the public was in an uproar. Seeing the secret leaked, the US side was flustered. In less than 24 hours, on the morning of the 28th, the Liquidation Commission ordered the US military stationed in Shanghai to "dismantle" the rumors of eleven heavy bombers. However, when Chinese and foreign reporters from Shanghai went to Jiangwan Airport to visit these aircraft, they were refused entry by the US military police guarding the airport. Therefore, the so-called "dismantling" is full of doubts. Generally, Shanghai newspapers commented on this incident as a means of "burying one's head in the sand." This transaction between the US and Chiang exposed the lie of the US spokesman that "US aircraft sold to Chiang are all civil aircraft."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai report: After the news of the US-Chiang negotiations on the transfer of war materials was announced, Zhang Gangbo, a representative of the Shanghai People's Peace Petition and director of a industrial and commercial company, published an article in Shanghai Wenhui Daily on September 2nd, entitled "In the Midst of Raging Flames, US Undersecretary of the Army Peterson Comes." Zhang raised seven questions to Peterson, such as: If the materials to be sold to China are not military supplies, weapons, aircraft, or any other purely military products, then it has nothing to do with the US Department of the Army. Why send the Undersecretary of the Army to negotiate? Today, civil war has broken out in China and is undergoing a life-and-death struggle. Can any materials obtained be conducive to China's recovery and its peacetime experience? Peterson is requested to give clear explanations on the nature of the 500 million yuan of materials, the issue of China's civil aviation rights, and the US selling 150 military aircraft to the Chiang government. Zhang stated: "Since the victory, the United States has consistently implemented a two-faced policy, attempting to fill the strategic points of China's military with US anti-Soviet bases, while at the same time curbing the expansion of the Communist Party in the country, so it fully supports the National Government in order to monopolize the Chinese market as the tail of capitalist overproduction consumer goods. Because of the errors in policy, going back on its word and getting bogged down in the mire, there is a tendency to recklessly and stubbornly carry it out to the end, so that the reputation of the United States in China and internationally has plummeted." At the same time, it has made China's warmongers reckless and launched a civil war, reaching an unmanageable stage. Zhang called on the people of China and the United States to immediately urge the Washington authorities to change course and quickly turn back.

　　美贱售轰炸机予蒋内战
    上海舆论界咸表愤慨
    张＠伯氏著文质问彼特森
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：两月前，美国国外物资清理局上海办事处秘密出售轰炸机一百五十架予国民党政府之罪恶交易业，由合众社驻华分社于上月二十七日予以揭露。据该记者报导：是项轰炸机全属“Ｂ２５”型，内中有十一架为“Ｂ２５”型密辙尔式重轰炸机。此一百五十架飞机原值美金数百万元，现仅以美金五十万元售给国民党政府，平均每架仅以足购吉普车一辆之代价美金三千元出售。此一事实亦经国民党中央航空公司管理处某负责人证实。据美国物资清理局处长麦卡比宣称：是项飞机系作破烂零件售与中航公司，然中航公司经理秦孟亲告合众社记者称：“此等飞机不能视为陈旧，因渠等尚可飞行三千小时，且为战争后期制造者。”另据视察各该飞机之空军军官称：“各机均可作轰炸之用，其中无一机曾将机关枪及炸弹架等军事设备拆去。”足证所谓“破烂零件”云云，纯属谎言。此一黑幕揭露后，沪中西各报竞相刊载，群情哗然，美方见秘密泄露，顿显慌乱，在不到二十四小时内，乃于二十八日晨，物资清理局命令驻沪美军“拆毁”十一架重轰炸机之传说，但当沪中外记者前往江湾机场参观此等飞机时，却遭受卫机场之美宪兵拒绝入内。故所谓“拆毁”云云，疑窦百出。一般沪报评述此一事件为“掩耳盗铃”之手段。美蒋这一交易，揭破美国发言人所谓“售蒋美机均属民用机”的谎言。
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：美蒋谈判让售战争物资消息公布后，沪人民和平请愿代表中与实业公司董事张纲伯氏，于九月二日在沪文汇报发表论文，题为《弥天烽火中，美陆次彼特森来了》。张氏向彼特森提出七项质问，如：行将售与中国的物资内既非军火、武器、飞机或任何其他纯粹军用品，则与美国陆军部无关，何必派陆军部次长前来谈判？今日中国内战爆发，正在作生死斗争，任何物资能得到有利于中国之复兴及其和平时期之经验吗？对五亿金元物资的性质，中国民用航空权问题，及美方将一百五十架军用机售与蒋政府等问题，均请彼特森予以明白解释。张氏称：“美国从胜利以来，自始至终施行两面政策，欲将中国军略要点充美国防苏基地，同时阻遏共产党在国内伸张势力，故而全力支持国民政府，以遂其独占中国市场为资本主义下生产过剩消费品的尾闾。因政策的错误，出尔反尔，陷入泥淖，大有不顾一切索性蛮干到底之势，以致美国声望在中国与国际，已一落千丈。”同时，使中国的好战分子有恃无恐，发动内战，到了不堪收拾地步。张氏呼吁中国及美国人民，立即督促华府当局改弦易辙，赶快回头。
