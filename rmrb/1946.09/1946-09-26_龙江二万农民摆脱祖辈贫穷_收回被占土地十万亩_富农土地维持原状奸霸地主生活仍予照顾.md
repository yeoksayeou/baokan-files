Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, September 23rd: In the twenty administrative villages along the banks of the Jiqin River in southwestern Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, a massive rural reform movement has been underway for the past month. A total of 20,000 people have been involved in the struggle. The twenty villages have collectively received 10,000 hectares (100,000 mu) of land illegally seized by traitors and local tyrants, as well as 486 shi of grain, 147 head of cattle and horses, and 100 pigs and sheep. Two thousand people from these twenty villages have joined the peasants' association, and 400 have joined the militia.

This area was formerly known as "Great Northern Wilderness." Traitors, local bullies, warlords, and bureaucrats occupied vast amounts of wasteland, gradually attracting famine refugees to cultivate it. These refugees farmed for these traitors and landlords, who accounted for only 10% of the village population, for their entire lives or even for generations. The landlords owned 87% of the village's land, while the remaining 90% of the poor peasants owned only 13%. The land owned by the family of traitor and local tyrant Zhou Wanfa alone accounted for 34% of all the land. When tenant farmers farmed for these bullies, they had to provide their own livestock, and the rent was as high as one shi and one dou (440 catties per shi) per hectare. The fruits of these peasants' blood and sweat were squandered by the traitors and bullies at will.

After this reform, the rural land relations have undergone great changes. After the peasants of Wanfa Polder recovered the land illegally seized by the bullies, many landless tenants quickly rose to become rich peasants. Poor peasants and poverty-stricken hired laborers who have received land and livestock are also in a position to become middle peasants. The peasants have worked diligently for generations and have never seen a land deed. They were overjoyed when they received and exchanged land deeds this time. Luo Fengjiu, a tenant farmer from Xiaoqin Agou, kept fiddling with his land deed, saying, "I have never seen this thing in four generations of farming. I have to take a good look at it this time." The peasants in various places are also planning to build new houses. They said, "We must build new houses, build a courtyard wall (only landlords had courtyard walls in the past), and build a latrine."

The targets of the peasants' struggle are traitors and local bullies, but their families are still appropriately cared for. For example, the family of Zhou Wanfa, the former polder chief, now has seven members. They originally owned 738 hectares of land and now own 7 hectares, with 7 shi of grain reserved. The land of rich peasants remains untouched, which refutes the lies that "the big households are divided, the small households are divided, and both big and small households are divided into poverty."

### 龙江二万农民摆脱祖辈贫穷  收回被占土地十万亩  富农土地维持原状奸霸地主生活仍予照顾

　　龙江二万农民摆脱祖辈贫穷
　　收回被占土地十万亩
　　富农土地维持原状奸霸地主生活仍予照顾
    【新华社齐齐哈尔二十三日电】嫩江省龙江县西南济沁河两岸十万垧黑土地上的二十个行政村，最近一个月来掀起了农村大改革运动，卷入斗争群众共达二万人，二十个村共分得汉奸恶霸非法侵占之土地万垧（即十万亩），并分得粮食四百八十六石，牛马一百四十七头，猪羊百只。廿个村中有二千人参加农会，四百人参加民兵。这一地区过去为有名的“北大荒”。奸霸与军阀官僚占有大量荒地，陆续招来逃荒户开垦。这些逃荒户，终身甚至几辈子为这些仅占有全村人口百分之十的奸霸地主耕种，地主占全村土地百分之八十七，而其余百分之九十的贫农却只占土地百分之十三。汉奸恶霸周万发一家的土地，则占全畈土地的百分之卅四。佃农为恶霸耕地时，牲畜均须自备，而租额每垧租子多至一石一斗（每石四百四十斤），这些农民血汗得来的果实，即由汉奸恶霸任意挥霍。此次经过改革，农村土地关系起了很大变化，万发畈农民收回恶霸非法夺地后，许多无地佃户很快上升为富农；贫农与赤贫雇农分得土地牲畜后，亦已具备走上中农的条件。农民世代辛勤耕种，从未见过地照，此次分地换照，欣喜万分。小沁阿沟佃农罗凤九，手拿地照不断摆弄着说：“种地四辈子没见过这东西，这回可得好好看看。”各地农民并计划修盖新屋，他们说：“我们一定要盖新房子，盖个院墙（过去院墙只有地主家才有），砌个茅厕。”农民斗争的对象是汉奸恶霸，但仍适当照顾他们的家小，如伪畈长周万发家，现有七口人，原有土地七百三十八垧，现有土地七垧，留粮七石。对于富农土地则维持原状，这就使那些“分了大户分小户，大户小户都分穷”的谎言不攻自破了。
