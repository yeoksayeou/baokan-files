Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th. On August 26th, the Harbin Public Security organs uncovered a massive military conspiracy plotted by Chiang Kai-shek. When Chiang's army was clamoring to attack Harbin, Jiang Pengfei, a head of the puppet Manchurian army (later incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek into the New 25th Army as commander), secretly infiltrated Harbin with his important military officers under orders to stage a riot on August 28th. This was detected by the Harbin Public Security organs, and two days before the planned riot, the case was cracked and the masterminds were arrested. In addition to the main culprit Jiang Pengfei, those arrested include Hu Binxue and Li Mingxin, important organizers of the case and military members of the "Enemy-Occupied Area Work Committee" of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee's Northeast Four Provinces Branch; Zhang Dongpo, Chief of Staff of the New 25th Army; Jiang Xueming, Chief of the General Staff Office; Zhang Jiping, Minister of Military Supplies; Tao Zhaiqing, Chief of the Adjutant Office; Deng Bokang, Commander of the 1st Army of the Kuomintang 6th Route Army; Yang Dequan, Commander of the 2nd Army; Cui Dagang, Commander of the 3rd Army; Jing Xianyi, Deputy Commander; Wen Xingyuan and Bao Guansan, Division Commanders and other high-ranking Chiang Kai-shek military officers, as well as all personnel involved in Jiang's planned riot system.
