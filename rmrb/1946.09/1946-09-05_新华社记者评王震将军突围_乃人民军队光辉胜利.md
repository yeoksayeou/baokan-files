　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on General Wang Zhen's Breakout
    A Glorious Victory for the People's Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on General Wang Zhen's successful breakout, stating: The unit under General Wang Zhen of the Central Plains Military Region, after a mini-Long March of thousands of miles, crossing the four provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, and breaking through more than ten layers of encirclement by the Chiang Kai-shek's army, has finally safely arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This has fundamentally shattered Chiang Kai-shek's plan to "eliminate the enemy's active forces," and is another glorious victory for the Chinese People's Army. The Xinhua News Agency reporter continued: Cheng Qian, Director of the Kuomintang's Wuhan Headquarters, stated at a press conference on the 28th of last month that Li Xiannian's unit had already been defeated, with the remnants numbering less than two thousand. However, the facts prove that it is not Li Xiannian and Wang Zhen who have failed, but Chiang Kai-shek and Cheng Qian themselves. Chiang Kai-shek used more than thirty divisions of troops to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression campaign against the Central Plains Military Region immediately after the Japanese surrender, confidently believing that he could annihilate them in one fell swoop within forty-eight hours. After Li's unit broke out, he continued to pursue and intercept them for more than two months, determined to put the 60,000 soldiers and civilians of the Central Plains to death. However, contrary to the reactionaries' expectations, not only was the main force of Li's unit not damaged, but it was also tempered and became stronger, and it became more closely integrated with the people in the vast areas. In addition to General Wang Zhen and General Pi Dingjun having separately arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Su-Wan Border Regions, other Central Plains troops have gained a firm foothold in the southern Shaanxi, western Henan, and Sichuan-Shaanxi border areas, and are continuing to wage guerrilla warfare in the eastern Hubei and western Anhui areas, forming a strategic alignment with the liberated areas of Su-Wan and North China. When Cheng Qian was boasting shamelessly, he probably had already forgotten that he had been reprimanded to his face by Chiang Kai-shek precisely because he could not annihilate Li Xiannian's unit.

　　新华社记者评王震将军突围
    乃人民军队光辉胜利
    【新华社延安二日电】新华社记者就王震将军胜利突围事评称：中原军区王震将军所部经过数千里的小长征，横过鄂湘陕甘四省，突破蒋军十余次重围，终于安全开抵陕甘宁边区，使蒋介石“消灭匪军有生力量”的计划根本破碎，这是中国人民军队的又一次的光辉胜利。新华社记者继称：国民党武汉行辕主任程潜上月二十八日在记者招待会上称：李先念部业已失败，残部不足两千。然而事实证明，失败的不是李先念和王震，而是蒋介石和程潜自己。蒋介石在日本投降当时就以三十余师兵力经营对中原军区部队的大围攻，满以为四十八小时内可以一鼓歼灭。在李部突围以后，继续又追击堵击逾两个月，必欲置中原六万子弟兵于死地。但是，出乎反动派意料之外，李部主力不但未受损伤，而且锻炼得更加坚强，更和广大地区的人民结合起来。除王震将军与皮定钧将军已分别开抵陕甘宁与苏皖边区外，其他中原部队已在陕南豫西地区和川陕边境站稳脚步，并在鄂东、皖西地区继续进行游击战争，与苏皖及华北的解放区成犄角之势。程潜在大言不惭的时候，大概已经忘记正因自己不能歼灭李先念部而受到蒋介石的当面训斥罢。
