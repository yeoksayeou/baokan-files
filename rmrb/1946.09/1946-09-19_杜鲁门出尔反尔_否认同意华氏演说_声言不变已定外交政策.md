Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 15th: Reports from various sources indicate that President Truman made two statements after Wallace's speech. Truman told reporters on the 12th that he "agreed with the entire speech by Wallace, and there is no difference between Wallace's speech and Byrnes' policy, and in fact, it is consistent with that policy." (Reuters, Washington, 12th) But two days later, Truman "specially" summoned reporters (Reuters said this method had not been used since the President announced the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan) to read another statement, saying that his remarks on the 12th were "casual answers," and these answers "did not express the thoughts I wanted to express. What I meant to express was the idea that I only approved Wallace's right to give a speech, but did not intend to express that I approved a speech as a statement of foreign policy." (Reuters, Washington, 14th) Truman continued, "The established foreign policy of the United States government has not changed, and there will be no significant changes until there is a meeting with the current Secretary of State and Congressional leaders." Although the spirit of Wallace's speech is contrary to the current policy of the US government, Wallace's criticism is moderate, and Wallace has not openly opposed Truman within the Democratic Party. On Truman's side, because Wallace is the only Roosevelt old-timer in his cabinet, he wants to use Wallace's prestige to remedy the increasingly lost popular support for the Truman administration. Truman's first statement "agreeing" with Wallace's speech served this purpose. However, the reactionary faction in the US government's decision-making body did not allow Truman to say this, so Truman had to come out and make a corrected statement.

　　杜鲁门出尔反尔
    否认同意华氏演说
    声言不变已定外交政策
    【新华社延安十五日电】各方报导：华莱士演说之后，美总统杜鲁门发表了两次谈话。杜鲁门于十二日告记者称：他“同意华莱士全部演讲，华莱士的演讲与贝纳斯的政策并无分歧，而实际上乃与该政策一致”。（路透社华府十二日电）但在两天之后，杜鲁门“特别的”召请记者（路透社称：此种方式，自总统宣布苏联对日宣战用过以来迄未用过），宣读另一声明，他说他在十二日所作的是“随口回答的”，这种声明回答，“并没有表达出我想表达的思想。我的意思是要表达如此的思想，即我只批准华莱士发表演说的权利，但无意于表示我批准了一个作为外交政策声明的演说”。（路透社华府十四日电）杜鲁门继称：“美国政府既定的外交政策并无改变，在未与现任国务卿及国会领袖之间集会之际，将不致有任何重大的改变。”华莱士演说的精神，虽与美政府现行政策相反，但华氏的批评是温和的，华氏还没在民主党内公开反对杜鲁门。在杜鲁门方面，因为华氏是他的内阁里唯一的罗斯福旧人，很想利用华氏的威信来补救杜氏政府的日益失去的人心。杜鲁门第一次谈话“同意”华氏演说，其作用即在于此。但是美国政府内决策的反动派不容许杜鲁门这样说，于是杜氏就只得出来作更正的谈话了。
