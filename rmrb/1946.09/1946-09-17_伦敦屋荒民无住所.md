　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: London dispatch: London is experiencing an extreme housing panic. On the 8th, over a thousand homeless people in the Kensington district lined up and occupied rooms in a building that had been used as a refugee shelter during the war and was now about to be rented out for ten pounds a week. When the police arrived, four hundred families had already moved in. Furthermore, news from elsewhere: Britain is currently suffering from rainstorms, threatening the grain harvest; three-quarters of the grain in Buckinghamshire is at risk of being destroyed. On the 8th, the western suburbs of London were flooded to a depth of one foot. The streets of two cities had become small canals, and in another city, many houses were flooded to a depth of four feet, with much furniture floating down the streets. Western railways have been rendered impassable.

　　伦敦屋荒民无住所
    【新华社延安十日电】伦敦讯：伦敦住宅极感恐慌，八日，肯辛顿区一千多无屋可住的人民，列队占据了战时曾为难民收容所而现时即将以一星期十镑租金出租之大厦各房间，警察赶到时四百家庭均已住下。又讯：英国各地现正受到雨灾，威胁着谷物的收割，白金汉郡四分之三的谷物将被毁坏。八日，伦敦西郊水深一英尺，有两个城市的街道已成小运河，另一个城市的许多房屋水深四英尺，许多家具皆沿街漂流，西部各铁路已不能通车。
