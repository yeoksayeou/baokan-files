Gaotang Hidden Puppet Troops Repent and Turn Themselves In
Surrendering Various Concealed Weapons

[This newspaper's Weixian dispatch of the 25th] Within a month and a half of the liberation of the Fourth District of Gaotang, more than 500 puppet soldiers have been won over to repent and reform. During the several years of the rule of the traitorous tyrant Shen in this district, a total of 850 young people were forced to join the puppet army. After the liberation of the Fourth District, most of the puppet soldiers scattered and hid in various villages, observing and fearing. The mass movement turn-over team, in coordination with the local government, carried out a month and a half of efforts to win them over. Currently, 555 people have repented and reformed, and have turned in 2 mortars, 7 machine guns, and more than 360 long and short guns.
