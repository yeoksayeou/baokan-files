　　[Report from the Jiluyu Front of this newspaper, 26th] The people's soldiers of Jiluyu – the Eighth Route Army, launched a self-defense counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops who occupied our Jining City. On the 20th, they raided the eastern gate of Jining and completely wiped out over 300 garrison puppet troops of Yan Xianzun's unit and Chiang Kai-shek agents who were holding a meeting. Another unit of the Eighth Route Army simultaneously raided the southern gate, capturing over ten people, including Zhang Xichun, the head of the puppet "Youth League," and rescued all the cadres and masses of our democratic government who had been detained by the traitor Wu Ni Huawen from prison. Our army is now intensifying its encirclement, and the citizens who have escaped from the city are actively participating in the war. They say: "We must wipe out Wu Huawen's puppet troops in Jining!"
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Weixian, 26th] The puppet troops of Wang Ni Jinxiang's unit, entrenched in the isolated stronghold of Liaocheng, ventured out of the city on the 18th under the cover of four American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, and were heroically resisted by local troops and militia. One Chiang Kai-shek aircraft was hit by gunfire and burned down, and more than 90 puppet troops were killed or wounded. Wang Ni fled back in a panic. Another report: The militia active in the Dingtao area annihilated more than 50 puppet troops of Zhi Ni Chengde's unit, who were entrenched in Anrenji, 30 miles southwest of Chengwu, on the 21st, and seized more than 50 rifles.
　　[Report from the Jiluyu Front of this newspaper, 26th] After the Chiang Kai-shek troops penetrated deep into our central Jiluyu area, the militia and local armed forces in various places actively carried out guerrilla warfare, constantly depleting the invading army. In the past ten days, the militia and independent battalion of Kaocheng County alone seized a Chiang Kai-shek military vehicle, a radio station, five machine guns, two warhorses, and a quantity of ammunition. They also destroyed four blockhouses of bandit troops reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek, and shot and killed two major bandits, Yin Yuwen and others, on the spot. The capture of the American-made vehicle was as follows: Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Kaocheng were driving a vehicle eastward. When they reached Xietan Village, the vehicle got stuck in the mud. The Chiang Kai-shek troops forced the masses to push the vehicle, so the masses sent someone to the independent battalion to report. Our independent battalion rushed to the scene and seized the vehicle.
　　[Report from Jiluyu of this newspaper, 25th] Thousands of militiamen in Peitong County, after the Chiang Kai-shek's 88th Division (original army) occupied our Peixian City, in order to adapt to the needs of the battle, formed a number of militia detachments, militia companies, and small armed work teams, and jointly swore an oath to resolutely trap the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the city, and not to stop fighting until they were driven away, and widely launched guerrilla warfare. From August 25 to the beginning of this month, in more than 20 days, they fought more than 30 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek troops and their special agent armed forces, and seized 23 long and short guns, 30 large bags of rice, and a number of important documents. This has delayed Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to occupy Peixian and control the Pei (County) Tong (Mountain) Highway as a supply line for expanding the civil war in Jiluyu, and they have been trapped in Peixian City all day long.
