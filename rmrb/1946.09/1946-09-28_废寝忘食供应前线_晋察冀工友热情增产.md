Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th. A fervent production increase movement to support the front lines has been universally launched in factories throughout the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The casting output of the North China Machinery Factory in Zhangjiakou has sharply increased by a quarter. In the past, each foundry worker produced 40 finished boxes per day; now even young apprentice Zhang Kuilong has increased his output to 72 boxes. Ironworkers Yao Fengnian and Liu Yunxin, among others, completed a certain repair project in a blitz of five days, working day and night, sometimes for more than 22 hours a day. Worker Li Zhi of the Ping-Sui Railway Manufacturing Plant has increased his daily output of screw rods from four to twenty, while Zhang Jiaxing manufactures copper nails, increasing his output from 28 to 70. Workers at the repair shop, to ensure smooth transportation for both the front and rear, disregarded the frequent bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes and intensified their work. Machinist Yin Quanchen braved the high heat of the steam boiler to enter the engine head and repair a fault within two hours that normally would have taken six or seven hours. Workers Zhang Yongcai and Hou Dechun, among others, repaired a giant locomotive destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes in half the usual time. Worker Li Deyu of the Zhangjiakou Tobacco Company managed the machine operated by five people, saving a significant amount of manpower to be投入 into other urgent production departments. Workers at the Xuanhua China Pottery Factory have accelerated brick production from one kiln every four days to one kiln every two days. The Jizhong Guanghua Pharmaceutical Factory, within one week of starting operations, had already completed 2,000 pounds of medical supplies for aid. The "10,000 Pound Medicine Production in Three Months" campaign initiated by the factory workers is expected to be completed ahead of schedule in just over a month. The Gaoyang Huaju Dyeing and Rolling Factory, rushing to produce winter clothing fabrics for the Eighth Route Army soldiers, has increased its daily output from 800 bolts to 2,000 bolts. All staff members have learned and mastered production techniques and are投入 into the movement.

　　废寝忘食供应前线
　　晋察冀工友热情增产
    【新华社张家口二十四日电】火热的增产支援前线运动，已在晋察冀边区各工厂普遍展开，张市华北机器厂铸铁量已急剧提高四分之一，过去每个翻砂工人每天出产成品四十箱，现在连青年学工张奎龙亦增加至七十二箱。铁工姚凤年、刘运信等在五天内突击完成某种修理工程，废寝忘食，一天工作到廿二小时以上。平绥铁路制造厂工人李智，每天出产螺丝杠已由四条增到二十条，张家兴制造铜钉由二十八个增到七十个。修理厂工人为保证前后方运输畅通，不顾蒋机频繁轰炸，加紧工作，机匠尹全臣曾冒着高热的蒸汽锅进入机头中，在两小时内修理好平时六七小时不易完成的故障。张永才、侯德春等工友，提前一半时间，修好为蒋机炸毁的巨型机车。张垣烟草公司工人李德玉，管理五个人操纵的机器，节省大量人力投入其他紧急生产部门。宣化中国窑业工人，制砖率已由四天一窑加速到两天一窑，冀中光华制药厂开工一周，即已完成两千磅救护药品，该厂工人所发起的三个月制药万磅运动，可望于月余时间内提前完成。高阳华聚染轧厂，为八路军战士赶制冬装衣料，每日产量亦由八百匹增至二千匹，所有职员均已学习掌握生产技术，投入运动中。
