　　Clarify the Guiding Principle of Education Serving the People
    Handan City Elementary School Teachers' Symposium

    [Report from this newspaper, Handan] The Municipal Education Department convened a symposium of all district elementary school teachers, lasting half a month, which concluded at the end of last month. Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government, Director Chao of the Education Department, and Mayor Wang of this city personally attended to provide guidance. Commissioner Gao Zhenwu of the Border Region Government, drawing upon his decades of experience in education, specially lectured the teachers on teaching methods. Director Chao provided very detailed instructions on the issues of old and new educational lines. He expressed great satisfaction that everyone could break away from the old circles and consider that elementary school students should learn skills such as abacus calculation and writing travel permits. He also called for the establishment of "two-five" system (attending school on Tuesdays and Fridays) half-day classes and other systems to suit the needs of the broad masses of liberated people. Through this symposium, the participants clarified that elementary education should teach students practical knowledge for daily production, as well as the ability to write letters and keep accounts, and cultivate a new type of production laborer. Both teaching and learning should be focused on doing. In terms of teaching methods, there was a consensus that the injection-style method, which disregards the children's level and needs and allows teachers to teach as they please, must be abandoned, and more use should be made of heuristic, auxiliary, and self-study methods. Every elementary school should meet the needs of the masses and be effectively integrated with mass movements, production, and families. After this symposium, the entire district will use the four months of this year as a period to experiment with the new educational guidelines. From practice, we will further understand the new educational guidelines and strive for new developments in terms of experience.

　　明确教育服务人民方针
    邯市小学教员座谈
    【本报邯郸讯】市政府教育科，召开之全市区小学教员座谈会，历时半月，已于上月底结束。边区政府杨主席，教育厅晁厅长及本市王市长等均亲临指导。边区政府高振五委员，以其数十年从事教育之经验，专门为教员们讲述教学方法。晁厅长对新旧教育路线问题指示甚详。他对大家能离开旧的圈子，考虑小学生应当学会珠算，开路条等知识极为满意。并号召为适合广大翻身群众需要，改设“二五”制（每星期二、五入学）半日班等制度。经过此次座谈，与会者明确了小学教育应教会学生日常生产知识。和写信记账的能力，并要培养出一批新型的生产劳动者，教与学都要以做为主。在教学法上，一致认为必须丢掉不顾儿童程度与需要，教员愿意怎样教就怎样教的注入式的方法，应多运用启发、辅助、自学的方式。任何小学都要适合群众需要，切实与群运、生产、家庭结合。在此次座谈后，全市区将以本年四个月为实验新的教育方针之时期。从实践中进一步体会新的教育方针，并要求在经验方面取得新的发展。
