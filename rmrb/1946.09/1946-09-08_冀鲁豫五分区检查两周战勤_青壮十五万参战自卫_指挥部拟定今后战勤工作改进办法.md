[This article was] Transmitted by this newspaper's Heze [菏泽] dispatch on the 5th. The Rear Defense Command of the Fifth Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan [冀鲁豫] made a preliminary inspection on the 24th of the past two weeks of war support work. In the patriotic self-defense war, the entire area achieved total mobilization of the people. In the short period of two weeks, 156,650 young and middle-aged people participated in front-line war support work, accounting for slightly less than one-tenth of the total population of the area. In this self-defense war, many model cadres at all levels with strong leadership emerged, and the masses in various places also demonstrated the heroic spirit of not fearing difficulties and not shirking hard work. Leading cadres in counties such as Qibin [齐滨], Heze [荷泽], Cao County [曹县], Dongyuan [东垣], and Chengzhuang Yan Village [成庄檐村] all set an example by sharing weal and woe with the masses and promptly carried out propaganda to help the masses solve difficulties. Duan Qinghai [段青海], a cadre from the Yongshui District [永绥区] of Heze, personally led 19 stretchers, penetrated deep into the front line of Qi County [杞县], rescued the wounded, and completed a great task. Yuan Yusun [袁玉孙], a member of the Yuanlou [袁楼] Farmers' Association in Huangdian District [黄店区] of Dingtao [定陶], went to the front line while ill and vowed not to return home until the task was completed, thus completing the supply to the front line and ensuring the needs of the front line. This enthusiastic participation in the war fully demonstrated the determination and enthusiasm of the border area masses to crush Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas. This is the reason for the victory of the border area's self-defense war, and it also lays the foundation for the complete victory of the border area's self-defense war. In order to better complete the war support tasks in the future, the command formulated the following improvement measures: (1) Conduct extensive and in-depth current affairs education to make the masses in the entire area deeply understand the serious significance of this self-defense war. (2) Immediately implement shift changes, and, where conditions permit, try to maintain one-third of the force engaged in production, so that war and production are organically combined to ensure the source of material supply for the self-defense war, strengthen persuasion and mobilization, strictly prohibit simple punishment methods, and vigorously implement the commendation of models to ensure the smooth progress of mobilization work. (3) Strictly organize, establish political work, unify command, and clarify tasks. (4) Establish and improve water stations, transit stations, and bivouac stations, so that participating masses and militiamen do not feel difficulties in life; mobilize civilian medical personnel to universally establish clinics, rescue teams, and medical teams; expenditures are not restricted, but are controlled by each county and reimbursed based on actual expenses. (5) Vigorously reward various new creations and models in various tasks, and allocate 5 million yuan as bonuses for the previous period.
