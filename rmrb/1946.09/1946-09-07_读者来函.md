Reader's Letter

　　Our People's Daily is always in short supply everywhere and impossible to subscribe to, but some government organs, production departments, and pharmacies subscribe to the newspaper not to read it, but to wrap medicine and other things. From our investigation, such as with the commercial producers of the troops (35th Regiment), the post office delivered the August 8th newspaper on the 15th, and on the 16th they used the newspaper to wrap money to be turned over to the bank. Also, a certain pharmacy cut up the new newspaper to wrap medicine; things like this are not good. We should know how much effort it takes to print a single newspaper!

　　I think this phenomenon is not only in Jingxing County, but it is bound to exist in other places as well. I specifically bring it up hoping everyone will pay attention to it, and no matter what, do not waste our newspapers.

August 21st

    我们的人民日报到处感觉不够看订不上，但是竟有些机关生产部门与药社，订上报纸不是为了看，而是为的包药及包其它东西。从我们检查出的如部队商业生产者（三十五团），邮局十五日送去八月八号报纸，十六日就将报纸包了款子交到银行了。另外如某药社将新报纸割了包药，象这样都是不好的，我们应知道一张报纸印出来要化费多少精力呀！
    我认为这样的现象不只是井陉县有，其它地方免不了也会有的，特提出来望大家注意，无论如何不要浪费我们的报纸。
