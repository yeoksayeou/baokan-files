    The Kuomintang's Ability to Launch a Civil War Entirely Relies on U.S. Armed Intervention
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] Moscow broadcast on the 3rd of Masinu's commentary on the Chinese situation, pointing out: The United States is repeating its policy from October of last year in China, implementing military intervention to help the Kuomintang army. The commentary stated: No matter how unfavorable the current military and political situation is for the Kuomintang reactionaries, they have already begun a general offensive against democratic forces. According to the opinions of broad sections of Chinese society, the reason for this situation is that the United States is carrying out armed intervention on the side of the Kuomintang reactionaries, making it possible for the Kuomintang to launch a civil war against Chinese democratic forces. The internal war in November and December of last year was able to stop because the initial major assistance from the United States after the war failed to crush the resistance of Chinese democratic forces, after which the United States began its mediation. The American reactionaries used peace talks as a way to continue strengthening their assistance to the Kuomintang. On the one hand, American political representatives came out as mediators in peace talks, while at the same time, the American government unilaterally provided financial and military assistance to the Kuomintang. On March 21, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Naval Aid to Chiang bill, which played an important role in the new military offensive launched by the Kuomintang reactionaries in April. On June 6, the Kuomintang announced a ceasefire and resumption of negotiations, while on June 19, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the Benas bill to expand military assistance to the Kuomintang. At that time, the Associated Press correspondent in Washington reported that, according to Washington official representatives, regardless of whether China establishes domestic peace, the plan to train the Chinese army will continue, and even if negotiations with the Communist Party break down, the United States should fully support Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, the June negotiations broke down, and at the end of the month, the Kuomintang began a new and more violent offensive. In July, the U.S. State Department stated that although the mission of repatriating prisoners of war had been completed, the U.S. Marines were still stationed in China, and at the same time, the U.S. government began negotiations with the Kuomintang to sell them surplus materials worth 50 million U.S. dollars.
    The Anping Incident on July 11 showed what the U.S. military was stationed in China for. The Chinese reactionaries and their American protectors had high hopes for this conflict. Chinese and American social figures have long seen that American intervention and the Chinese civil war are interconnected. Not long ago, Eleanor Roosevelt stated that many Americans would welcome the cessation of U.S. military intervention in China in order to promote peace. The Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee also came to the same conclusion, saying: If the United States does not help the Kuomintang government, the Chinese civil war will naturally stop.

　　马西努广播评论
    国民党能发动内战
    全靠美国武装干涉
    【新华社延安四日电】莫斯科三日广播马西努论中国时局指出：美国在中国正重复其在去年十月间的政策，实行军事干涉以帮助国民党军队。该评论称：国民党反动派不管目前军事政治局势对于他们是如何不利，但已经开始向民主力量进行总进攻。据中国广泛社会人士的意见，发生此种情形的原因，是美国站在国民党反动派方面实行武装干涉，使国民党有可能发动内战以反对中国民主力量。去年十一、十二两个月的内战能以停止，乃美国在战后初期的重大帮助不能使国民党粉碎中国民主力量的反抗后就开始了美国的调停，美国反动派把和平谈判作为继续加强对国民党的帮助。一方面美国政治代表出来充当和平谈判的调停人，同时美国政府单方面给予国民党财政与军事的帮助。三月二十一日美众院通过了海军援蒋法案，对国民党反动派在四月开展的新的军事进攻起了重要的作用。六月六日国民党又宣布停战恢复谈判，而六月十九日众院外委会便通过了贝纳斯所提扩大予国民党以军事帮助的法案。当时美联社驻华盛顿记者消息，据华府官方代表意见，不论中国是否建立国内和平，训练中国军队的计划将继续进行，即使与共产党谈判破裂，美国还应当完全拥护蒋介石。这样一来，六月谈判破裂了，月底国民党就开始了新的更加猛烈的进攻。七月间，美国务院又声明虽然遣俘任务已完成，但美海军陆战队依旧驻在中国，同时美政府开始与国民党谈判，把价值五万万美元的剩余物资卖给国民党。
    七月十一日安平事件，表明美军驻在中国究竟是为的什么目的，中国反动派与美国保护者对此次冲突抱着极大希望，中美社会人士早已看到美国干涉与中国内战是彼此联系的。不久前罗斯福夫人声明许多美国人将会欢迎停止美国对中国的军事干涉，以便促进和平。远东民主政策委员会亦得出同样的结论谓：如果美国不去帮助国民党政府，中国内战自然而然就会停止了。
