　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: A delayed dispatch from New York: The New York Herald Tribune published an editorial on the 4th of this month by its correspondent in China, Steele, stating: "Chiang Kai-shek has made many good plans, but has never done anything. The Kuomintang has been in power for twenty years and has not implemented Sun Yat-sen's ideology. For twenty years, it has done nothing for the Chinese people and has not removed inappropriate and dishonest officials. The Kuomintang has been making promises for twenty years and is still continuing to make promises. In this situation, how can Chiang Kai-shek receive good reviews from Americans?" Steele also said: "The Chinese Communist Party has left a very good impression in the United States, mainly because the Communist Party has truly practiced land reform to liberate the oppressed peasants of China. They do not just talk about land rent and tax rates, but actually do things. In addition, the governments they have established in several places are also more honest than the previous governments. We must admit that they have indeed benefited the Chinese peasants."

    赞扬中共救民德政
    美国人民对土地改革印象极佳
    【新华社延安十四日电】纽约迟到消息：纽约先驱论坛报于本月四日发表其驻华记者斯蒂尔的社评内称：“蒋介石订了许多好的计划，但是始终还没有做出什么来。国民党执政二十年，没有把孙中山的主义实行出来。二十年来没有为中国人民做了什么，没有革除不适当且不诚实的官吏。国民党做了二十年诺言，现在还在继续的做诺言，在这种情形下，蒋介石如何能得到美国人的好评呢？”斯氏又称：“中国共产党已在美国留下很好的印象，主要原因是共产党的确实践了土地改革来解放中国受压迫的农民，他们不是空谈地租和税率，而是实际上做了些事。此外他们在几处建立的政府，也比从前的政府来得诚实。我们必须承认他们的确使中国农民受到了利益。”
