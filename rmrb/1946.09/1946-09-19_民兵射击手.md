　　Militia Sharpshooter

　　The crowd in the meeting hall suddenly raised their heads and stretched their necks, as more than ten thousand eyes focused on one person. He was a stout man, about twenty-five or six years old, with a white towel wrapped around his head, standing in front of the rostrum to receive the red brocade banner awarded to him by the county military committee.

　　“That’s Fang Xiaowu!” one militiaman asked in surprise to another militiaman sitting next to him, casting sharp glances straight at Fang Xiaowu from time to time.

　　“Where is he from?” another militiaman asked.

　　“How did he shoot so accurately!” This militiaman tilted his head, staring blankly at Fang Xiaowu.

　　Fang Xiaowu is from Shangyao Village in the fourth district of Licheng, born into a poor peasant family. For five generations, from his ancestors to him, they had toiled and sweated for the landlords. Only after the Communist Party came did Fang Xiaowu's luck change.

　　I witnessed his shooting in this competition. The target was buried one hundred meters away from the shooting position. He mimicked the movements of combat on the front line, carefully aimed, and fired two shots within twenty seconds, each hitting the ten ring!

　　"Good show!" the crowd shouted like a thunderclap. He was the first person to shoot at the target.

　　"What good show? As long as you practice aiming at home regularly and understand the quirks of your gun, everyone can hit the ten ring," Fang Xiaowu explained to the audience.

　　"Fang Xiaowu! Are you simply competing for the sake of the red flag, a purely competitive act?" At the time, I couldn't think of a more colloquial way to ask him, so I asked him in this manner.

　　"Humph! What you're saying is completely wrong! I'm not doing it to get the red flag. I think this is a good opportunity to practice with live ammunition, to train myself and improve my shooting skills, so that I can hit the enemy with every shot on the front line!" Fang Xiaowu said, touching his gun, looking at me.

　　It was drizzling. Fang Xiaowu slung his gun over his back and used the towel on his head to wrap the gun's bolt. He wasn't wearing a straw hat.

　　"Why are you wrapping the gun's bolt and carrying the gun backwards?" I deliberately asked him.

　　"If you don't take good care of your weapon, you won't be effective in battle! If the gun rusts, you can't fight the enemy!" Then he told me: Last year, during the Shangdang Campaign, they were surrounded by the enemy. They had no choice but to break out with bayonets. "The die-hard troops were terrified at the sight of the bayonets!" "When we get close to the enemy at close range, we use hand grenades. If the die-hard troops surround us, we charge with bayonets!" These lessons were learned from their personal combat experience. Eight or nine years of war have made them stronger and richer in experience.

　　When I asked him why he joined the militia, he said, "To avenge my parents and ancestors! To protect the good times!" He added, "This spring I went to Qinzhou to participate in the war and stayed in Songcun and Beipo. I saw that the people of Qin County couldn't even get enough thin rice soup to eat. When I came back to Licheng, the worst! We only eat noodles once every three days!" This comparison made me understand one thing: This is why the people want to defend themselves. Honestly speaking, having gotten used to the free and democratic life of the liberated areas with enough food and clothing, who would want to return to the bitter sea of the old China?

　　Fang Xiaowu is not afraid of death! Last year, during the Shangdang Campaign, he was surrounded by the enemy in Wangma. He was the first to charge, and he killed two enemies. Why is he so brave? He said, "If the reactionaries come, not only will I not be able to live, but my whole family won't be able to live. I'm not afraid to sacrifice myself to save my whole family from suffering!" He paused and continued, "We militiamen have been participating in the war for several years, and not many of us have been sacrificed. Last year's Shangdang campaign was so big that I alone chased after five die-hards!" His eyes shone with confidence, and his face was full of the confidence of victory.

　　民兵射击手
    张培礼
    会场里的人群，突然把头抬起，把颈伸直，一万多只眼睛注视着一个人，他粗胖的身体，有二十五六岁，头上蒙着一条白手巾，站在主席台前接受着县武委会奖给他的红锦旗。
    “他就叫方小五！”一个民兵很惊讶的问着坐在他身旁另一个民兵，并不时的放出尖锐的眼光直望着方小五。
    “他家是那里？”又一个民兵问着。
    “人家怎么打的那样准！”这个民兵歪着头，呆呆的瞅着方小五。
    方小五是黎城四区上窑村人，贫农出身，从祖辈到他五辈子是流自己的汗，给人家地主干。共产党来了以后，方小五才交了红运。
    我曾见他这次竞赛的射击，在射击的地方距离埋的靶有一百公尺，他学着像在火线上一样作战的动作，细心瞄准，在二十秒钟内放射了两枪，枪枪命中十环！
    “好把式！”人群像巨雷一样的叫喊了，他是第一个打靶的人。
    “什么好把式，这东西只要自己在家经常瞄准，摸着自己的枪毛病，每个人都能上十环。”方小五这样的给观众们解释。
    “方小五！你是不是为了红旗，单纯的竞赛而竞赛呢？”我当时想不出更通俗的话来问他，只有这样子向他问着。
    “吓！你这根本说的就不对！我不是为了得红旗，我觉得现在是个好机会能够实弹演习，可以锻炼一下自己，提高射击本领，上火线能百发百中有效的杀死敌人！”方小五用手摸着他的枪眼望着我说。
    天下着细雨，方小五把枪倒背起来，而且用手把自己头上的手巾拿下来把枪拴包起来，他没有戴草帽。
    “你为什么要把枪拴包起来，还倒背枪？”我故意的问着他。
    “对自己武器爱护不好，打起仗来不利落！枪一生锈不能打敌人！”接着他告我说：去年在上党战役，敌人包围过他们，他们没办法，后来就用刺刀冲出来，“顽固军见刺刀就吓的抖擞！”“在接近敌人短距离时，我们就用手榴弹，如果顽固军包围了，我们就用刺刀冲！”这些知识都是从他们亲身战斗经验中体会出来的，八九年的战争，锻炼的他们更坚强更丰富了。
    当我问到他为什么要参加民兵，他说：“要替父母祖先报仇！保卫好时光！”他又说：“我今年春天到沁州参战，住在松村，北坡，见到沁县的老百姓，连稀米汤还喝不饱，回来黎城，最败幸！也三天吃一顿面！”他这样的比较，使我明白了一件事：这就是人民为什么要自卫的原因，老实说，过惯了解放区丰衣足食自由民主的生活，谁还愿再回到苦海的旧中国里去？
    方小五不怕死！去年上党战役，在王麻被敌人包围了，他就是首先冲的一个，而且杀死了两个敌人，为什么他这样勇敢呢？他说：“反动派来了不但自己不能活，全家人也不能活，不怕牺牲自己，免的全家人都遭殃！”他停顿了一下，又继续的说：“我们民兵参战好几年啦，也没有牺牲过几个，去年上党那样大的战役，我一个人追他五个顽固！”他的眼放着饱满的光，面孔充满着胜利的信心。
