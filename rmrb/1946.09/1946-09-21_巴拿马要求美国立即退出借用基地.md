Some members of parliament, during the debate, accused the United States of not withdrawing from certain bases that Panama had ceded during the war, calling this an act of imperialist brutality and a "big liar policy."

　　巴拿马要求美国立即退出借用基地
    【新华社延安十八日电】据美马联社巴拿讯：（迟到）巴拿马（按系中美一小国）议会本月一日通过议案，要求美国立即放弃巴拿马在战时许给美国供保护巴拿马运河之用的防御基地。一部分议员在辩论时指责美国不退出巴国战时让予的若干基地，此举为帝国主义之暴行和“大骗子政策”。巴拿马政府称：美陆军所取得之八十三处基地，其协定已于九月一日期满，自应全部退出。
