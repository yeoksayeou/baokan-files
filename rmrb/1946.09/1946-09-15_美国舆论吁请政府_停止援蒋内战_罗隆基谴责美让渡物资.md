　　Luo Longji Condemns US Transfer of Materials
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] US News Agency, Washington, 10th: The St. Louis Post-Dispatch urges the US government to stop aiding the Chinese Nationalist government so that the true leadership of China can be freely exercised. The newspaper also stated: "We (referring to the United States) can no longer tolerate the political assassinations by the right-wing elements of the Kuomintang (such as the death of scholar Professor Wen Yiduo, etc.). If moderate politicians, with the help of the Democratic League, can influence national affairs and be free from the growing terror of the Kuomintang secret police, then they can obviously exert much and beneficial power. We hope that the agreement reached on the first of this month in political consultations between the parties will be observed and implemented. The Kuomintang actually violated this agreement two months later."
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th] According to TASS, Shanghai, 9th: Luo Longji of the China Democratic League commented on September 9th that the agreement to transfer US war materials to the Chinese government was interference in China's internal affairs and assistance to the Nationalist government in attacking the CCP.

    【新华社延安十二日电】美新闻处华盛顿十日电：圣路易邮报吁请美国政府停止援助中国国民政府，中国之真正领导权得以自由发挥。该报又称：“我们（指美国）对国民党右翼分子政治性暗杀之举动（如学者闻一多教授之死等事），不能再事容忍，中庸之政治家如借助民主同盟左右国事，免受日益兹长之国民党秘密警察恐怖支配，则他们显然能发挥极多及有益之力量。我们希望本月一日间各党政治协商所获致之协议，将被遵守奉行。国民党实际上于两个月后，即违反此项协定。”
    【新华社延安十一日电】据塔斯社上海九日电：中国民主同盟罗隆基氏，于九月九日评论美国战争物资让渡于中国政府的协定为干涉中国内政，援助国民党政府进攻中共。
