Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei, 24th. In the Chiang-occupied areas of Huaibei, the people's local armed forces captured Da Li Ji (a major town at the junction of Si County, Lingbi County, and Ju Ning County) at dawn on the 18th, annihilating more than 200 Chiang soldiers. On the same day, another unit of the local armed forces captured Fugou, a county between Si (County) and Su (qian) County, capturing more than ten Chiang soldiers and guns. Furthermore, the Wuhe local armed forces cleared out the Jiang-affiliated district and township governments in northern Wu (He), killing two township chiefs, capturing more than 30 people and guns, seizing two boxes of ammunition, and repelling seven large Chiang army boats coming to reinforce from Wuhe City, sinking one of them and drowning more than ten Chiang soldiers. The leaders of the New Fourth Army's Central China Military Region have issued orders of commendation, encouraging them to continue their efforts and widely carry out guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Chiang army.

Xinhua News Agency, Southern Jiangsu Front, 23rd. The Chiang army in southern Jiangsu, which has suffered repeated blows from the New Fourth Army, has begun to stir again after a long period of adjustment, replenishment, and reinforcement. Chiang's troops, entrenched in Nantong and Rugao, launched separate attacks and occupied the towns of Linzi, Dingyan, and Shigang in the southeast of Rugao and the northwest of Nantong on the 19th and 20th, attempting to converge on the line from east of Rugao to Jugang (near the sea). One company of Chiang's troops, which occupied Linzi, sent a detachment westward on the 19th to harass Nanmatang (more than 20 li southeast of Rugao). It was ambushed by the local armed forces of the New Fourth Army at Lujiazhuang. All the Chiang soldiers in this company were annihilated, more than 40 Chiang soldiers were killed or captured, one 60mm mortar, five Type 96 machine guns, eight American-made Thompson submachine guns, and dozens of rifles were seized. The 83rd Division (renamed from the 100th Army) of the Chiang army in Taizhou, in coordination with the 65th Division (renamed from the Army), attacked from the Da Xiaomi Zhen and Huitang areas on the Hai (an) Tai (zhou) line. The New Fourth Army is currently resisting them. The 15th Division (renamed from the Army) of the Chiang army in Yangzhou, after suffering heavy losses in its previous attack on Shaobo, has recently transferred a part of the 26th Division (renamed from the Army) from Huainan to reinforce it, giving the impression that it will cross again to attack Shaobo.
