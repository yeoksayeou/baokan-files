[This dispatch from Weixian, 23rd, reports] The peasant emancipation movement in Jinnan has reached a climax in sixteen counties. Many traitors and local bullies have been duly punished. In Shazhuang, Fifth District of Pingyuan, two major special agents were uncovered, and one Mauser pistol and three rifles were seized, prompting an anti-espionage movement in various villages. After the anti-traitor struggle was launched in the Fourth District of Gaotang, a large number of puppet soldiers and puppet officials were won over to repent. In the East and West Houli and Changtun areas of the First and Sixth Districts, the assets of traitors worth nearly 10 million yuan were confiscated. Peasants received a large amount of land. In Jizhuang, Eighth District of Xiajin, the local bully Xing Jizhou was overthrown, and more than 70% of the villagers participated in the peasants' association. Twelve impoverished families received land. In Lij and Wangmiao of the Second District, peasant and women's associations were established spontaneously, immediately launching a struggle to settle accounts with the local bullies and achieving victory. Wangmiao is a small village of more than 30 households, with the number of peasant association members growing to more than 50 and the number of women members reaching more than 60. Twenty young people joined the militia. After the peasants were given land, they all began to actively engage in production. In the First District of Enxian, more than 10,000 people in more than 10 villages participated in the struggle, and the peasants recovered a large amount of land that had been seized. More than 3,500 people in sixteen villages, including Sanlizhuang and Mazhuang in Dezhou, accused the major traitor Chen Haiquan and confiscated all his land. The anti-traitor and rent reduction movement is now developing vigorously. In the Wuxun District, more than a dozen villages struggled against the puppet regiment commander Huang Zhuling, confiscating more than 200 mu of his land and distributing it to the peasants. The peasants' association expanded by more than 340 people. In Huizhai of the Yongzhi Second District, where feudal forces had the strictest control, a peasants' association of fifty or sixty people has now been organized, and the militia has grown to more than 20 people, and they are brewing a struggle. In the Wulichangtun and Houzhai subdistricts of the Fourth District, local bullies and landlords have been overthrown one after another, strengthening the peasant organizations and the militia. In the Seventh District of Shenxian County, the masses of the entire district jointly held a public trial of special agent murderers Yang XueLi and Zhang Entai. In the newly liberated areas, villages are beginning to break with the "change of dynasty" thinking and the fear of retaliation by special agents. A clearing of accounts and bitterness movement has been universally launched in the villages of the Second and Sixth Districts of Guantao. Wang Ji cleared out Wang Zongrong's extortion of more than 120 mu of land, and more than 200 people participated in the peasants' association on the spot. After the joint anti-traitor campaign in six villages, including Luzhuang in Handan, many young people enthusiastically joined the militia. In the thirty-two villages near the puppet bandit area of Yongnian, 30,000 people also began to surge into the anti-traitor tide, overthrowing nineteen traitors and local bullies in half a month. The Sixth District organized a militia joint defense, and the anti-espionage self-defense movement in various villages is developing rapidly. After the struggle in more than ten villages, including Jiazhuang in the First District of Linzhang, the peasants' land demands were quickly resolved, and all the young people joined the militia. The movement is developing in an all-round way. In the Xichenjiazhuang area of Baixiang, fifteen villages publicly tried and executed the traitor Wu Jingmin. The anti-espionage joint defense in the Longhua area of the Second District has been organized, and the mood is very high. The mass movement in various places is still continuing on a large scale.
