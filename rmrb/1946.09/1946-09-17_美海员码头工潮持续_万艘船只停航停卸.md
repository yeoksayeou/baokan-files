Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th - According to reports from American and British news agencies: The American seamen and dockworkers strike, which began at noon on the 5th of this month, is still continuing. To date, the number of striking workers has expanded from 100,000 to 500,000, and the number of ships halted has increased from 1,500 to over 5,000, with over 5,000 cargo ships stranded in ports unable to unload. In New England, sugar refineries and tanneries are experiencing a shortage of raw materials, and sugar refineries in New Orleans will be forced to close within two to three days. Yesterday, the Seafarers International Union, in coordination with the strike committee, once again appealed to the two major national labor organizations in the United States (the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations) to order a 24-hour general strike by their 14 million members if the Wage Stabilization Board does not change its wage decision. Leaders of the two major labor organizations have not yet made a decision regarding the appeal from the strike committee. When the Wage Stabilization Board convened a special meeting on the 10th, worker representatives refused to attend, with only employer representatives participating. At the meeting, employer representatives requested government approval of the wage agreement they had negotiated and agreed upon with the seamen, but officials still refused to approve it. Undersecretary of Labor Collet, who returned to Washington after negotiating with leaders of the Seafarers International Union in San Francisco, has reported to Labor Secretary Schwellenbach that union leaders told him that if the government changes its wage rules, the strike will end immediately.

　　美海员码头工潮持续
    万艘船只停航停卸
    【新华社延安十三日电】据美英通讯社报导：自本月五日中午开始的美国海员与码头工人大罢工仍继续中，迄今罢工工人已自十万扩展至五十万，停航船只自一千五百艘增至五千余艘，并有五千余艘货船停在港口而不能卸货。在新英格兰，制糖厂及制革厂原料皆感缺乏，新奥尔良的制糖厂将在两三日内停闭。昨日海员工会配合罢工委员会已再次吁请美国全国性的两大劳工团体（美国劳工联合会与产业职工会联合会）于工资平准局再不改变其工资决定时，下令该两组织所属一千四百万工人实行总罢工二十四小时。两大劳工团体领袖目前尚未作出决定，配合罢工委员会的吁请。在工资平准局于十日召开特别会议时，工人代表拒绝出席，仅资方参加。会议上资方代表要求政府批准其与海员工人已洽商同意的工资协议，但官方仍拒绝批准。从旧金山与海员工会领袖谈判毕归返华府的劳工部次长叩拉，已向劳工部长施威伦巴报告工会领袖曾告诉他说，如政府改变其工资法则，罢工立将结束。
