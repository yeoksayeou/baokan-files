[This dispatch comes from our newspaper in Changzhi on the 19th] In the border areas of Taihang, small propaganda teams, including local cadres, militiamen, and local armed forces, have been organized to conduct patriotic self-defense propaganda in the Jiang-occupied areas. A propaganda team in Tangyin widely shouted to Jiang's puppet strongholds and sent a large number of propaganda materials. They also held mass meetings in seven villages in the guerrilla areas dominated by Jiang's puppets, explaining the reasons why Jiang's army would inevitably be defeated. The families of Jiang's puppet soldiers are now persuading their children to withdraw from the civil war and turn over a new leaf. The special agent forces organized by Jiang's puppets have gradually disappeared under our propaganda disintegration and armed suppression.

　　汤阴武装宣传队对蒋伪据点喊话
    【本报长治十九日电】太行各边沿区，纷纷组织包括地方干部、民兵与地方武装的小型宣传队，深入蒋占区开展爱国自卫宣传战。汤阴×个宣传队普遍对蒋伪据点喊话，送大量宣传品，并在蒋伪占优势的游击区召开七个村庄的群众会议，讲解蒋军必败的道理，当地蒋伪军家属正纷纷劝说自己的孩子脱出内战，改邪归正。蒋伪组织的特务武装，在我宣传瓦解与武装镇压下也逐渐消声匿迹。
