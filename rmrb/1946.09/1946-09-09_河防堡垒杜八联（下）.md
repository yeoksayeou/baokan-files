　　River Defense Fortress Du Balians (Part 2)
    Xi Bingwu
    The People Forged in Struggle
    The people of Du Balians have turned themselves around through struggle. They live free and happy lives, with men and women wearing neat new clothes. The appearance of being withered and haggard is gone. They labor in the fields, singing songs of freedom and victory. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the executioners Wei Ansheng and Li Huipu, still attempt to drag them back into the dark and sinful life of the past. But in Du Balians, every time there is a war of self-defense, people shout out, "Display the tenacity of Du Balians!" "Wei Ansheng is the enemy of the people!" "Don't let the die-hard troops enter Du Balians!" The traditional spirit of struggle, coupled with the class consciousness awakened in the struggle for liberation, has made the people's will to fight even firmer. As soon as they hear that the die-hard troops are attacking, everyone rushes from their homes and fields to the front line, to the sentry posts. "Going to the front, what is there to fear about sacrifice?" has become the bold declaration of the people before battle. In a small village in Huaishu Zhuang, a militiaman was sick in bed when suddenly news came that "Po Tou is under attack." He abruptly jumped out of bed and said to his mother, "I'm going to fight Po Tou." After saying that, he went to the front line like a healthy young man without looking back or eating. When militiaman Wang ×× heard about the fighting, he ran forward regardless of everything. He, alone and bare-armed, chased the die-hard troops with a machine gun. He could pick up the hand grenades thrown by the enemy and "return them as gifts."
    I personally witnessed the great battle of May 24th, when the die-hard troops attacked the villages of Liuzhuang, Mazhu, and Liandi with over a hundred men. The old women and middle-aged women stood guard and checked pedestrians on the high ground about 500 meters away from the die-hard troops, watching the alarm bell, without panic, fulfilling their responsibilities. On that day, the militiamen of Mazhu and Liandi firmly defended the high ground east of the village. When their bullets were running low, they used hand grenades to repel five consecutive assaults by the die-hard troops, never retreating. After the heroic sacrifice of militiaman Kang Shengzhe of Liandi, the militiamen quickly carried his body back, and the women members made all the clothes for the deceased within two hours. The mother of Qu Yuanhui—an old lady in her sixties—also sent her own coffin for him to use. The young people of the entire village who went to the front line did not return, and the women and elderly helped with the encoffining, memorial service, and sending off the spirit, shouting, "We must avenge the dead!" When militiaman Xue Anhang was wounded and sacrificed, many men, women, and children comforted his grandmother and mother, saying, "He sacrificed gloriously for the whole village. We are all your children and will be filial to you." The warm love and friendship of the people of Du Balians is a strong and indomitable force. When I was wearing the white cloth strip, I was moved to tears. What a magnificent, intimate, and moving scene it was!
    In the struggles of the past few months, the people have created their own tactics, just as the joint defense commander and battle hero Xue ×× said, "We know how to fight now, and we are much more flexible than before. In the past, we only knew how to gather in mounds; now we know how to circle around and fight." They have learned to attack and defend. The militiamen often bury landmines on the enemy's roads or in Po Tou town. One "fixed mine" injured three die-hard troops in Po Tou, making the die-hard troops uneasy about walking. Later, when the die-hard troops took small paths, they buried mines in the small paths, and when they walked in wheat fields, they buried mines in the wheat fields, greatly threatening the activities of the die-hard troops. The militiamen are not only good at exploding, but also can strike when the die-hard troops are not wary. On May 11th, Wei Ansheng boasted to his subordinates, "The Eighth Route Army has no strength and dare not come to Po Tou." But the next night, the militiamen charged into Po Tou town in three routes, taking down Wei Ansheng's cooperative, giving Wei Ansheng a living lesson. Under the slogan of "one mine per step," the people of Du Balians universally make and learn to use stone mines. The adoption and universal development of this weapon will play a greater role, exploding into the heart of the die-hard troops. In this counterattack in Ji(yuan) Meng(county), they also served as the waterborne vanguard assault team, penetrating deep into the enemy's rear, Baipo and Nanchen, intercepting the die-hard troops, and coordinating with the regular army's eastward advance, which was another outstanding feat.
    Guard Against Pride and Complacency, Long-Term Planning
    But the people and leaders of Du Balians are not paralyzed by pride. First of all, they always pay attention to internal consolidation. They understand that "domestic thieves are hard to guard against." They know that in today's complex struggle, spies are ubiquitous, trying to sabotage the work from within. In their usual strict investigations, they discovered spies in Liuzhuang attempting to shoot battle heroes, spies spreading rumors in Mazhu, someone secretly colluding with die-hard troops in Liandi, and spies cutting landmine ropes in Liaolu. The occurrence of these things made the leading organs and the people pay attention to understanding everyone from their historical performance, work performance, and performance in struggle. They paid attention to adjusting the leadership composition, paying attention to the control of arms, checking household registrations, implementing a registration and reporting system for visitors, and making the strict road pass system more regular and serious. At the same time, they also knew the beastly nature of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They said, "Chiang Kai-shek doesn't keep his word and must always be guarded against." Therefore, they already have well-organized transfer organizations—liaison commands for transfer areas and guerrilla areas, rear construction, etc.—to deal with invaders when necessary. Du Balians has been focusing on long-term struggle, conducting rear militia support for front militia, overcoming the phenomenon of the front being busy and the rear being quiet. Attention is paid to the unified pace of Du Balians and other marginal areas, coordinating the struggle, and also paying attention to helping the masses of Zuoshan, Madong, and Jin'e to turn themselves around and struggle. In particular, the widespread launch of "speaking out about suffering and digging out the roots of poverty" in mid-July has thoroughly deepened the struggle to reduce rent and clear debts, which will play a decisive role in adhering to the long-term struggle of Du Balians, in further uniting the broad masses of the people, and in further improving combat will and combat effectiveness.
    A Group of Heroes
    The commander of Du Balians, the hero of Liuzhuang, Xue ××, is a famous, loyal, brave, agile, and composed hero who is loved by the people. He is thirty-one years old, his family is very poor, and he only distributed three mu of land and redeemed four mu of land in this year's struggle. He has never been flustered in the struggle. He often says, "What are we afraid of? If we sacrifice, we sacrifice. The more panicked you are, the worse it is." Only those who dedicate their lives to the revolutionary cause have such determination and courage. He often takes off his clothes and fights bare-armed. He is very agile. Once, he had just transferred out of the ×× temple when Wei Ansheng surrounded the small temple with many people, desperately shooting at the broken walls of the small temple with heavy weapons, shattering the walls. But when the encirclement was compressed, they realized that there was not a single militiaman inside. He is very good at commanding battles. Of the more than 100 attacks, he won more battles and suffered fewer losses. Recently, he led the waterborne guerrillas to attack Xitan in the Yellow River, playing a significant role. When attacking Xitan, he and Comrade ××, the director of the Seventh District Armed Forces Committee, took a small boat to land first to cover the floating personnel, and also cut off the die-hard troops' water transportation, seizing many things.
    He himself is very hardworking, and his political stance is firm. The enemy once tried to lure him with "high positions and handsome salaries," but he did not waver, so Wei Ansheng sent someone to shoot him in the back.
    Qu ××, the director of the Armed Forces Committee of ×× village, is twenty-nine years old. He is very pure, kind to people, and cares about the lives of the militiamen. He has never lagged behind when the guns are fired in front. He is very calm in battle. He not only knows how to fight but also pays attention to the education of the militiamen, who all love him very much.
    Lei ×× is a young man in his twenties and is very active. In the battle on May 23rd, he killed the die-hard troops' Captain Zhang and the squad leader who were attacking me, and assisted the headquarters' reconnaissance personnel. Others such as the brave Wang ×× and Li ××, who pulled down the Japanese flag, are all outstanding heroes. They are loved and praised by the people of Du Balians.

　　河防堡垒杜八联（下）
    席炳午
    百炼成钢的人民
    杜八联人民从斗争中翻过身来了。他们过着自由愉快的生活，男女都穿上整齐的新衣服，形容枯焦的现象没有了，他们在田野里劳动，歌唱着自由胜利的歌曲。然而国民党反动派刽子手卫安生、李惠浦仍旧企图拖他们到过去罪恶黑暗的生活里。可是杜八联他们每当自卫战争的时候，人们都呼出了“发挥杜八联的顽强性！”“卫安生是人民的对头！”“不让顽军进杜八联。”传统的斗争精神加上翻身斗争中阶级觉悟，使得人民的斗争意志更加坚定了。一听说顽军来进攻，大家都由家里，由地里赶上火线，走上岗哨。“到前边去，怕什么牺牲？”成了人们在战斗前的豪语。在槐树庄的一个小庄子上，一个民兵病在床上，忽然传来消息说：“攻坡头”。他蓦然跳下床来，对他妈说：“我去打坡头去”。说罢，头也不回，饭也不吃，像没病的青年一样到前线去了。民兵王××一听见打仗，不顾一切的向前跑，他一个人赤着臂膀，架着机枪追击顽军。他能把敌人扔来的手榴弹又拾起来“回敬出去。”
    我亲眼见到五月二十四日的大战中，顽军以百余人向留庄、马住、连地等村进攻，老太婆们，中年妇女们，在离顽军约五百米的高地，一面望着警钟，一面站岗盘查行人，她们不慌不忙尽到自己的职责。当天，马住、连地民兵坚守村东高地，在子弹剩余不多的时候，乃用手掷弹打退顽军连续五次的冲锋，始终没有退却。连地民兵康生哲英勇牺牲之后，民兵们很快把尸体背回来，妇女会员不用两点钟，把一切死者的穿戴都做成了。璩垣辉的母亲——六十多岁的老太太，把自己的棺材也送给他用了。全村青年到前线去没有回来，妇女们、老年人帮着装殓祭奠送灵，并且高呼：“我们要为死者报仇”！当民兵薛安行负伤牺牲后，很多男女老少安慰着他的祖母及母亲说：“他是为全村光荣牺牲了，我们都是你的儿女，有我们孝顺你老人家。”杜八联人民的热情友爱，就是坚强不可屈服的力量。当我挂着白布条时，也被感动的不觉落下泪来。这是如何壮烈、亲密而动人的场面啊！
    在几个月来的斗争中，人民创造出自己的战术，正如联防指挥员战斗英雄薛××所说：“我们会打仗了，比以前灵活多了，过去只知道聚圪塔，现在知道转圈儿打”。他们学会了进攻，也学会了防御，民兵经常把地雷埋到敌人来路上或坡头镇里，一颗“起不走雷”在坡头一下炸伤三个顽军，使顽军走路都不放心，后来顽军走小路，他们又在小路埋雷，走麦田往麦田埋雷，大大威胁了顽军活动，民兵不仅善于爆炸，而且能在顽军不提防时打进去。五月十一日，卫安生向他部下吹牛说：“八路军没有什么力量，他不敢到坡头来。”但是第二天黑夜，民兵分三路一下冲入坡头镇，打下卫安生的合作社，给卫安生一个活生生的教训。杜八联人民在“一步一雷”的口号下，普遍打石雷，学石雷，这种武器的采用与普遍开展，将发挥更多的作用，炸进顽军的心脏。在这次济（源）孟（县）反击中，他们又担任了水上先头突击队，深入顽后方白坡、南陈，截击顽军，策应正规军东进，更是一个出色的壮举。
    戒骄戒懈长期打算
    但杜八联的人民与领导者却毫不麻痹骄傲，首先他们经常注意内部的巩固。他们了解“家贼难防”，他们知道在今天的复杂斗争中，特务无孔不入，企图从内部破坏工作。在他们平时严密的侦查中，在留庄发现了特务企图打战斗英雄的黑枪，在马住发现特务的造谣，在连地发现有人暗与顽军勾结，在蓼鹿发现特务割地雷绳，这些事情的发生使领导机关和人民注意从历史上工作中斗争中的表现上来了解每一个人。他们注意到调整领导成份，注意武装的掌握，清查户口，实行来往人员登记报告制，严格的路条制度，都作的更经常而认真。同时，也知道国民党反动派的野兽成性，他们说：“蒋介石说话不算话，时常都得防备他。”所以他们已经有了组织好的转移组织——转移地区，游击区的连络指挥，后方建设等——以备于必要时与进犯者周旋。杜八联已从长期斗争着眼，进行后方民兵支援前方民兵，克服前边忙后边静的现象。注意到杜八联与其他边沿地区的统一步调，配合斗争，也注意到帮助左山、马洞、金蛾群众翻身斗争，特别是七月中旬普遍开展了诉苦“挖穷根”，彻底深入减租清债斗争，这在坚持杜八联长期斗争上，在进一步团结广大人民上，在进一步提高战斗意志和战斗力上，将起着决定作用。
    一群英雄
    杜八联的指挥员留庄英雄薛××，这是人民所共同爱戴的一位有名的忠诚勇敢机动沉着的英雄。他三十一岁，家里很穷，在今年斗争中翻身才分配了三亩地赎回四亩地，他从来没在斗争中惊慌失措过，他常说：“怕什么，牺牲就牺牲，越慌越不行”。这是将生命献于革命事业的人才有这样的坚定、勇敢，他常常脱下衣服赤着臂膊打仗，他很机动，有一次他从××庙里刚转移出去，卫安生用很多人包围了小庙，用重武器拚命的向小庙破墙上射击，把墙打的稀烂。但当压缩包围圈时，才知道里边没有一个民兵。他很会指挥战斗，一百多次进攻中，打胜仗的多，吃亏的少，最近他率领水手游击队在黄河中攻击西滩，发挥了很大的作用，攻西滩时，他和七区武委会主任××同志乘一支小船先行登陆掩护浮水人员，而且打断了顽军的水上交通，缴获很多东西。
    他本人很刻苦，政治立场坚决，敌人曾以“高官厚禄”引诱他，他不动摇，以致卫安生派人要打他的黑枪。
    ××村武委会主任璩××二十九岁了，他很纯洁，他对人和气关心民兵的生活，前边枪一响，他从来没有落过后，打仗很沉着，他不仅会打仗而且又注意民兵的教育，民兵们都很爱他。
    雷××是二十多岁的青年，很积极。在五月二十三日的战斗中，他打死了向我进攻的顽军张队长和班长，援助了司令部的侦察员。其余如勇敢的王××，拔过日本旗的李××，都是很出色的英雄，他们受到杜八联人民的爱戴与赞扬。
