　　[This newspaper's front line in the Longhai area, 3rd dispatch] The Third Brigade and one regiment each from the Twentieth Brigade, belonging to the Jiang troops' Third Division stationed in Kaocheng, launched an attack on our liberated area east of Kaocheng on the 30th of last month. On the afternoon of the same day, they occupied Du Lou, west of Baimaoji (Baimaoji is over 50 li east of Kaocheng, within the territory of Caoxian). On the 2nd of this month, the Jiang troops in Kaocheng again used four regiments, dividing their forces into two routes, to attack our troops on the Baimao-Dazhai line. Our local garrison forces launched a heroic counterattack, immediately inflicting a heavy blow on the Third Brigade (originally a division, now renamed) of Zhao Xitian's Tenth Army, killing, wounding, and capturing over 700 Jiang troops. According to the captured soldiers, their Ninth Regiment commander was killed by our forces.
