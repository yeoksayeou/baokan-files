　　50,000 people in Hongdong held a celebration meeting for two days on the 12th and 13th to celebrate the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, and inspected their own strength, preparing to meet any heinous attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan puppet troops. At the meeting, 126 militia combat heroes, blasting heroes, stretcher heroes, demolition heroes, and model workers who emerged in the self-defense war were awarded. Militia blasting hero Shang Qingfu lured Yan's troops into the stone minefield he had arranged in Fancun, killing and wounding five Yan soldiers. When Yan's troops fled, he had already been wounded in the waist, but he still tightened his belt and did not leave the firing line until Yan's troops were defeated. Comrade Li Wei, the political commissar of the county headquarters, praised these heroic deeds one by one, personally awarded various prizes, and called on everyone to continue their efforts to intensify martial arts training and defend their homeland. The county's militia has now doubled, and militia combat groups have been established in the newly liberated Lingtou and other twelve villages. During the meeting, a court was organized to publicly try four war criminals: Han Chengguo, Han Wei, Guo Tianlong, and Zhang Keming. The traitor Han was the leader of the pacification group left by the Japanese invaders and was also heavily used by Yan Xishan. In the past ten months alone, he captured and killed the deputy district chief of the democratic government, Huo Biqiang, and 79 innocent people. Until our army liberated Hongdong, a pair of bloody human ears that he was about to "report his merits" were found in the drawer of Han's office. The masses who attended the meeting scrambled to complain about their suffering. The Hongdong Local Court accepted the public's opinion and sentenced Han and the other four traitors to death in public.

　　The local armed forces and militia in Taihang have achieved brilliant results in the past six months. In Taigu, Qixian, and Yushe counties alone, more than 600 Yan's puppet troops were killed, wounded, or captured.
