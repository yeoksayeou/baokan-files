The True Face of the China Youth Party
	Shi Jingtang

	Editor's Note: The China Youth Party has now become a pawn of the reactionary clique within the Kuomintang, but its past reactionary rhetoric has not been systematically introduced. Comrade Shi Jingtang's article fills this gap. Another characteristic of the China Youth Party that the author has not introduced is its pro-American rhetoric.

	I. What Medicine is Being Sold in the Nationalistic Gourd?

	What is the true content of the nationalism advocated and promoted by the China Youth Party before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan? Xiao Chunu's "The Awakening Lion Faction Under the Microscope" during the Great Revolution had a unique insight into this issue, believing that the content of the nationalism advocated by the China Youth Party at that time was actually opposing the overthrow of imperialism and opposing the abolition of unequal treaties.

	After the War of Resistance Against Japan, their propaganda vigorously promoted those in history who advocated peace with foreign powers and the use of force domestically, saying: "Since the rise of Neo-Confucianism in the Southern Song Dynasty, the discussions of scholar-officials have been accustomed to being boastful and disregarding the facts. Song Gaozong's peace treaty was subjected to the condemnation of upright gentlemen at the time and in later generations. Emperor Chongzhen of Ming therefore insisted on fighting the Manchus to the end, and Yuan Chonghuan was suspected and died for being timid in the face of the Manchus. If the Ming court had not been swayed by boastful sentiments at that time, and had been willing to adopt Yuan Chonghuan's plan, temporarily ceasing hostilities with the Manchus and focusing on suppressing the domestic banditry, it would not have led to the subsequent collapse that was beyond recovery. The situation at the end of the Qing Dynasty was even more different. At that time, Western countries had no ambition to invade China's territory and sovereignty, and their goal was only to trade. If handled properly, it would not be difficult to achieve mutual benefit. However, the scholar-officials were too boastful, and those who understood the situation, such as Guo Songtao, were dismissed as traitors for discussing foreign affairs, which led to fighting when it should not have been fought, and not making peace when it should have been, causing the country to suffer great losses." (Chang Yansheng, "On Lin Zexu," New China Daily, June 3rd, 34th year of the Republic of China) The same author also proposed establishing the historical "marriage alliance" policy – also known as the "G.I. Girl" policy – offering their own women to win the favor of imperialism, truly a picture of servile flattery. The article stated: "Because ancient Chinese politicians and the general public had a broad mind, they actively used the G.I. Girl policy long ago and achieved remarkable results. We can say that the reason why ancient China was able to defend against the nine barbarians and expand its territory was largely due to the ancient Chinese politicians' skillful use of the G.I. Girl policy. The contribution of ancient Chinese women to the survival and independence of the country and nation was greater than that of these G.I. Girls. The modern G.I. Girl movement, we call it 'international fraternization,' in ancient times this kind of movement was called 'marriage alliance.'" "The first famous G.I. Girl in history was Jieyou, the daughter of Liu Wu, Prince of Chu in the Western Han Dynasty, the second famous G.I. Girl in history was Wang Zhaojun at the end of the Western Han Dynasty, and the first famous G.I. Girl in history was Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty." "Today, if China has Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang as great politicians, I think we should establish an active G.I. Girl policy, which has many benefits for the country. From the perspective of the War of Resistance, soon the Allied forces will mostly land in China. Given China's lack of resources and simple living conditions, what can we use to comfort these soldiers and encourage their fighting spirit? 'Food and sex are human nature,' common to people at all times and in all countries. If we don't have food, we have to use sex. The American soldiers still feel it's not enough. I don't think the great empire will demean its national character because of this." Finally, the author published the most shameful fallacy, denying the great Chinese nation with thousands of years of history, and advocating the use of American blood to transform the Chinese people. It was written like this: "From the perspective of national bloodlines, the prosperity of a nation depends entirely on how many times its people have undergone miscegenation. Historically, mixed-race children are the treasures of the nation. Jin Wengong, Tang Taizong, and Zheng Chenggong in Chinese history are all representatives of mixed-race children. After the Five Barbarians invaded China, China underwent a great ethnic mix, which led to the revitalization of the Sui and Tang dynasties. Today, the Chinese nation must undergo a mix in blood to inject fresh blood in order to rejuvenate from aging. If China has three million Allied soldiers in the future, and one Allied soldier is paired with one G.I. Girl, and each G.I. Girl produces a mixed-race child for China, twenty years later, China will not only have three million more male and female adults, but most of them will be the most physically and intellectually excellent. Is this benefit great or not?" (Chang Yansheng, "Salute to the G.I. Girls," New China Daily, June 4th, 34th year of the Republic of China) These are the typical contents of the China Youth Party's nationalism.

	II. Advocating Surrender and Organizing a Puppet Government During the War of Resistance Against Japan

	In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the China Youth Party did not dare to openly oppose the war, but divided the war into "should be fought" and "cannot be fought." In the New China Daily of September ×th, 29th year of the Republic of China, which specially carried "Understanding the War of Resistance," it said: "I remember when the Shanghai War first broke out, a friend asked me: 'Do you think this war of resistance is right?' I, of course, answered with my usual confidence: 'It should be fought, there is nothing wrong with fighting.' However, you must first understand that the meaning of 'should be fought' and 'can be fought' are completely different. 'Can be fought' does not necessarily mean 'should be fought,' and 'should be fought' does not necessarily mean 'can be fought,' so I only say 'should be fought,' and do not say 'can be fought.'" When Wuhan fell and the atmosphere of compromise swept the country, the China Youth Party, at this time, greatly praised the Vichy government of France, comparing Pétain to enduring humiliation and bearing a heavy burden, and further suggested that the authorities follow Pétain's example and organize a Vichy government, regardless of rumors and fear of being spurned. "All those who sincerely love the country should not only disregard their own private interests, but also disregard their own reputation. Wang Mang and the Duke of Zhou were no different at the beginning, but their results were worlds apart. Therefore, the ancients had a poem: 'If one dies early one day, who will know whether one is loyal or traitorous?' It is with a sigh for the intention of serving the country, and it is not necessary to care about rumors, but to focus on the result... If Pétain were to be like Hindenburg in the First European War, he would be allowed to be a laudable and tearful person in French history in the future." (New China Daily editorial, August 15th, 29th year of the Republic of China)

	III. Advocating "Official Rule" and "Gentry Rule" in Politics

	The political views of the China Youth Party only recognize a government ruled by a minority, believing that a truly democratic government will never exist in any era. Jiang Yungang said this in his article "The New World After the War": "In my opinion, any political form in any era cannot actually become a government ruled by the majority. However, a government ruled by one person is also not easy to see. Monarchical autocracy and dictatorship, etc., a one-person government, are mostly governments assisted or jointly acted upon by a minority. Therefore, what is indispensable for a wise monarch is still good ministers and virtuous prime ministers. A truly one-person ruling government is almost impossible to find. Especially for昏暴 the despotic dictators, what is even more needed are officials or lackeys. To talk about a government jointly ruled by the majority, it can only occur in reasoning and imagination. In essence, it is still presided over by a minority. This government ruled by a minority, although not called an aristocracy or oligarchy, but aristocratic or oligarchic politics always exist. In fact, there will be no real dictatorship, let alone real democracy." (New China Daily, June 8th, 31st year of the Republic of China) Subsequently, the New China Daily editorial talked about its "official rule" and "gentry rule." "There is no absolute distinction between the merits and demerits of official rule and gentry rule. If the official is qualified, then the official's use is more convenient and efficient. If the official cannot exert the advantages of bureaucratic politics and only expose its weaknesses, then it is not as good as the agreement of the majority of the gentry to govern, which can achieve the effect of mutual benefit. Although the gentry are not necessarily all good people, but since there are many people, everything must be negotiated and cannot be monopolized by anyone, which can reduce many malpractices, but the efficiency is lower." (New China Daily editorial, June 25th, 32nd year of the Republic of China) The so-called "official rule" and "gentry rule" are actually pseudonyms for feudal autocracy and dictatorship. Although a few people in the China Youth Party did raise the banner of democracy for a short period before the victory of the War of Resistance, after the victory of the War of Resistance, they did not even want this fake democracy banner. Since they advocate autocracy and dictatorship in politics, they must advocate foolish loyalty and absolute obedience to the leader's set of theories in thought. "The leader's highest right of decision exists for both relative and absolute reasons." "The so-called absolute meaning is that no matter what the content of the highest decision is, as long as it is indeed the leader's decision, it must be carried out without asking for reasons." "The so-called absolute meaning of loyalty is the will to faithfully carry out the leader's orders without considering theoretical right and wrong or practical gains and losses. Those who oppose loyalty from a utilitarian point of view are shallow-minded." (Chongqing version of "Guo Lun," No. 12)

	IV. Opposing Land to the Tiller and Opposing 25% Rent Reduction in the Economy

	On economic issues, the China Youth Party's view denies the existence of exploitation. "The widespread poverty of Chinese society today is due to the exploitation of capitalists and landlords." One of the most important land issues in economic issues, the attitude taken by the China Youth Party is to oppose land to the tiller and advocate land annexation. "Now some people feel indignant about land annexation and advocate confiscating the land of landlords, basing their advocacy on the 'legacy' of land to the tiller... Unfortunately, policy cannot be emotional!" (New China Daily editorial, June 29th, 34th year of the Republic of China) They not only oppose land to the tiller, but also oppose 25% rent reduction. "Today, the prevailing 25% rent reduction, it is not known what standard this is based on. Is it based on the necessity of the tenant farmers' lives? Is it based on the legitimacy of the tenant farmers' labor remuneration? Is it based on what should be reduced from the legitimate profits of the landlords?" (New China Daily, November 1st, 34th year of the Republic of China)

	V. Anti-Soviet, Anti-Communist, and Praising Fascism

	The China Youth Party's anti-Soviet and anti-communist remarks are common. Its anti-Soviet arguments even forget the most basic common sense of social science, regarding the socialist system and the capitalist system as one. Chang Yansheng, one of the leaders of the China Youth Party, said: "I think a socialist country is nothing more than a highly developed capitalism" "On the New Warring States Period" (Guo Lun, Issue 4). Not long ago, some fascists within the Kuomintang launched an anti-Soviet movement, and the China Youth Party echoed them, proposing that diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union must be backed by force, even at the cost of a war. "The Chinese people have a close understanding of the hideous face of the Soviet Union. We have always believed that the peace of the future world must be backed by force." (New China Daily editorial, March 15th, 35th year of the Republic of China) On the anti-communist issue, the China Youth Party has completely openly become an appendage of the Kuomintang and speaks with one voice as the Kuomintang. For example, during the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it echoed the Kuomintang, emphasizing the nationalization of the army and demanding that the CCP hand over all its armed forces. It believes that the Kuomintang government's recognition of the Communist Party having twelve divisions is "really losing the dignity and propriety of the government." Its deep hatred for the CCP is even evident as early as the 9th National Congress of the China Youth Party in the 27th year of the Republic of China, when someone proposed the idea of jointly defending against communism with Japan. "If a anti-communist agreement can be concluded with Japan under the principle of territorial and sovereign integrity, even a temporary truce may not be a solution to the situation." On the contrary, it is very kind to Nazi fascism and defends it. "In the fascist representative countries, Italy and Germany, their leaders' acquisition of power was supported by the majority of the people. Even today, the parliaments have not been abolished in the two countries. For example, whenever there are major events, they must appeal to the national general vote. Hitler is especially good at using this point." "Even in the most standard democratic countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, when voting in elections, coercion may be avoided, but is inducement not happening in the same way, but only with a difference in degree? If we put aside these factual curves for the time being and only look at the theoretical aspect, we cannot find that Fascism fundamentally denies democratic politics." ("Guo Lun," Volume 2, Issue 8) Hitler's aggressive and barbaric behavior is even more praised. "In terms of Hitler's personality, he can be said to combine Bismarck's iron and blood tactics, Nietzsche's superman philosophy, and Wagner's opera. His talent for speech, the magic of mobilizing the masses, and the storm-like actions are simply a replica of Wagner's music, fully mixed with the atmosphere of heroes, mystery, passion, and clamor. His early frustration, loneliness, and the low and poor status of Germany after the defeat crystallized the seeds of crazy resentment in his subconscious, so when Hitler launched the Second World War this time, Germany had that rapid and amazing success, which was of course not accidental. Su Shi said: 'When using troops, use their sudden and vigorous energy.' Hitler fully used this 'sudden and vigorous energy.'" (New China Daily editorial, September 15th, 31st year of the Republic of China).

	In summary, the China Youth Party's remarks and claims tell us that it is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal fascist group that depends on foreign imperialism and domestic warlords. It advocates a conservative feudal economic system in the economy and advocates autocracy and dictatorship, anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-democratic views in politics. The merger of the China Youth Party, this feudal fascist group, and the fascist group within the Kuomintang is not surprising. There is an old Chinese saying: "Birds of a feather flock together," which is the reason.

### 青年党的真面目

专栏：

　　青年党的真面目
    史敬棠
    编者按：青年党如今已成为国民党内反动集团的走卒，但它过去的反动言论还没有较系统的介绍过，史敬棠同志这篇文章正补足了这个缺陷。青年党另一个特点作者还没有介绍出来的，便是它的媚美言论。
    一、国家主义葫芦内卖的是什么药？
    青年党在抗战前抗战后所提倡宣传的国家主义真实内容究竟是什么？对于这个问题，还在大革命时期萧楚女写的《显微镜下之醒狮派》一文中有一段独辟的透见，认为青年党当时所主张的国家主义内容实际上就是反对打倒帝国主义，反对取消不平等条约。
    抗战以后，其宣传内容极力推崇历史上对外主和对内用武的人说：“中国自南宋理学大盛以后，士大夫的议论就习为虚骄不顾事实，宋高宗的和议就受尽了当时以及后世正人君子的斥骂，明思宗因此对满洲主战到底，袁崇焕以对满怵战被疑而死。假使当时明廷不中于虚骄的意气，肯采用袁崇焕的计划，对满洲暂时罢兵，而以全力削平国内流寇之乱，何致有后来的溃败而不可收拾。清末的情势更不相同，当时西洋各国对中国本无领土主权侵略的野心，所志不过在通商贸易，如果处置得当，不难两利并存，乃以士大夫的虚骄之气甚重，洞明时势者如郭嵩焘之流，俱以谈洋务被斥为汉奸，以致不该战而战，该和之而不和，国家吃尽了大亏。”（常燕生《林则徐论》新中国日报三十四年六月三日）同一作者又提出树立历史上的“和亲”政策——又名“吉普女郎”政策，奉献出自己的妇女以取得帝国主义的欢心，真是一幅奴颜媚骨。该文中称：“由于古代中国政治家及一般人的胸襟远大，老早就积极运用过吉普女郎的政策而收到了奇效，我们可以说中国古之所以能外御九夷开疆拓土，大部分是由于古代中国政治家的善于运用吉普女郎政策。古代中国妇女对于国家民族生存独立的贡献，莫有大于这一般吉普女郎者。现代的吉普女郎运动，我们叫做‘国际联欢’，在古代这一种运动称之为‘和亲’。”“历史上第一个有名的吉普女郎是西汉的楚王戊之女解忧，第二个历史上有名的吉普女郎是西汉末的王昭君，第一个历史上有名的吉普女郎是唐朝的文成公主”。“今天中国如有汉武帝、唐太宗是伟大的政治家，我以为应该树立一个积极的吉普女郎政策，这政策对国家的益处很多。从抗战观点来看，不久盟军就会大部在中国登陆，以我们中国物资缺乏，生活简陋，我们拿什么来慰劳一些战士来鼓励他们的斗志？“食色性也”，古今中外人所同具，我们没有食便得用到色的，美军还嫌不够，我想大帝国也不见得就因此贬损了国格。”最后作者竟发表了最可耻的谬论，否定了有数千年历史的伟大中华民族，主张以美国人的血统来改造中国人，它是这样写着的：“从民族血统的观点来看，一个民族的兴盛，全看他的民族经过几次混血，历史上的混血儿是民族的宝贝，中国历史上的晋文公、唐太宗、郑成功都是混血儿的代表。五胡乱华之后，中国经过民族上的大混合，才有隋唐的中兴，中国民族今天在血统上必须经过混合注入新鲜的血液，始能起衰老而复少壮中。假如将来中国有三百万盟军，一个盟军配以一个吉普女郎，每一个吉普女郎替中国生产一混血儿，二十年后，中国不但平添了三百万的丁男丁女，还大部分都是体格及智力最优秀的，这个利益大不大？”（常燕生《向吉普女郎致敬》新中国日报三十四年六月四日）这些就是青年党国家主义的典型内容。
    二、抗战期间主张投降，组织汉奸政府
    在抗战初期，青年党对抗战的主张还不敢冒然提出反对抗战，却把抗战分为“应该打”与“不能打”。在二十九年九月×日新中国日报特载《抗战的认识》中说道：“曾忆当沪战初起时，友人某君问我：‘你看这次抗战对不对？’我当然曾本我一往信心慨然答之曰：‘应该打，打是没有错的。’不过先要明白应该打与能不能打的意思完全两样，能打不一定应该打，而应该打不一定能打，所以我只说应该打，并不说能不能打。”迨至武汉失守以后，全国妥协空气甚嚣尘上，青年党人正在此时，大加赞扬法国维希政府，喻贝当为忍辱负重，更进言当局步法奸贝当组织维希政府，不必计流言怕人唾骂。“凡真诚爱国者不仅外自己之私利，并当外自己之名誉。王莽与周公，其始也并无何等不同，而其结果乃有天渊之别。故古人有诗云：“假使一朝身先死，一身忠伪有谁知”。殆有慨乎为国之居心，究不必计流言，而重在其结果也……果使贝当为效第一次欧战时之兴登堡，则将来容许在法国史上为一可歌可泣之人。”（二十九年八月十五日新中国日报社论）
    三、政治上主张“官治”与“绅治”
    青年党人政治上的主张，只认可少数人统治的政治，认为真正之民主政府在任何时代是不会有的。姜蕴刚在他的《战后新世界》一文里就是这样讲的：“在我看起来，任何时代任何政治形体，实质上就不能成为多数人统治，可是一个人统治的政治也还不易见，君主专制及独裁等一人的政治，大都还是少数人协助或共同行动的政治，因之所谓贤君万不可少的，还是良臣贤相，真正的一个人的统治政治几乎不易寻觅，尤其是昏暴的专制独裁者，更需要的是官者之流或爪牙之辈。再谈多数人共同统治的政府，只有推理与想像中可以发生，究诸实质，还是由少数人所主持，这少数人统治的政治，虽不称之为贵族或寡头，但贵族或寡头的政治，是时时存在着的，事实上不会有真正独裁，更不会有真正之民主”。（新中国日报卅一年六月八日）随后新中国日报社论大谈其“官治”与“绅治”。“官治与绅治本质并无绝对的优劣之分，官如得其人，则官运用较为便利效率较强，官如不能发挥官僚政治优点而徒暴露其弱点，则尚不如多数绅士协议而治，可以收互相补益之效。绅士固然未必尽属好人，但既属人多，则凡事必须协商，不能由任何人垄断，可减少许多流弊，不地效率较低耳。”（三十二年六月二十五日新中国日报社论）所谓“官治”“绅治”，实际上是封建专制独裁的别名，虽然青年党人中亦有少数人曾在抗战胜利前一个短时期打起过民主的招牌，但自抗战胜利后，连这假民主的招牌也不要了，既在政治上主张专制独裁，就必然在思想上要提倡愚忠，绝对服从领袖一套理论。“领袖之最高裁决权，其存在之理由，有相对绝对之义”。“所谓绝对之义，即不问最高裁决之内容如何，只须其确为领袖之裁决即不问理由而必然奉行之”，“所谓忠之绝对义者，即不得理论上之是非事实上之利害，而忠实奉行领袖命令之意志之谓也，世有以功利的见解反对忠者，乃浅薄之见也”。（重庆版《国论》第十二号）
    四、经济上反对耕者有其田反对二五减租
    经济问题上，青年党的看法否认有剥削的事实存在。“中国今日社会普遍的穷困，乃是由于资本家和地主的剥削”。经济问题中的一个最重大的土地问题，青年党所采取的态度是反对耕者有其田，主张土地兼并的。“现在感觉土地兼并的人，有的义愤填膺，主张没收地主的土地，而立基其主张于耕者有其田的‘遗教’。……无如政策不可感情用事何！”（三十四年六月二十九日新中国日报社论）他们不但反对耕者有其田，而且也反对二五减租。“今日盛行二五减租，此一标准之树立不知系何所根据。根据于佃农生活之必要乎？根据于佃农劳动报酬上之正当乎？根据于地主合法利润中之应当减乎？”（三十四年十一月一日新中国日报）
    五、反苏反共歌颂法西斯
    青年党反苏反共的言论屡见不鲜，其反苏论调甚至连一个起码普通社会科学常识都忘记掉了，将社会主义制度与资本主义制度看成一体。青年党领袖之一常燕生说：“我以为一个社会主义的国家不是别的，实际就是一个高度的资本主义”“关于新战国时代”（国论第四期）。在不久以前，一些国民党内法西斯派发动反苏运动，青年党复在旁摇旗呐喊，提出对苏外交须以武力为后盾，甚至不惜出于一战。“苏联狰狞的面目国人已有亲切之认识，我们始终认定未来世界的和平必须以武力为后盾。”（卅五年三月十五日新中国日报社论）反共问题，青年党完全公开成为国民党的附庸与国民党一鼻孔出气，如在国共两党谈判之际随声附和，亦跟着国民党强调军队国家化，要中共交出全部武装，对国民党政府承认共产党有十二个师，认为这种作法“实在失去政府的尊严和体统”。其对中共仇视之深，甚至远自抗战初期二十七年青年党九次大会上即有人提出与日共同防共的主张。“倘能在领土与主权完整的原则下与日订立防共协定，即暂时议和亦未始非解决时局之办法。”相反地对纳粹法西斯，却非常亲切为之辩护。“在法西斯的代表国家意大利和德意志，他们领袖之取得政权，都是由多数民众的拥护而来的，即在今日，两国之中也并未取消议会，例如每有大事，必诉之于国民的总投票，希特勒尤其善于利用此点。”“甚至最标准的民主国家如英法美三国，当选举投票的时候，威迫或者可免，而利诱不也是照样发生，不过仅有程度之差。如果我们把这些事实上的曲线搁过暂时不提，单就理论方面来看，我们也不能发现法西斯主义是根本否认民主政治的。”（《国论》第二卷第八期）对希特勒侵略野蛮之行为，则更是歌颂备至。“就希氏的个性来说，他可以说是裹俾斯麦的铁血手腕，尼悉的超人哲学及华格纳的歌剧于一身的。他演说的天才煽动群众的魔力，暴风雨般的行动，简直就是华格纳乐曲的副本，充分的渗杂着英雄、神秘、热情、叫嚣的氛团，而他早年的失意、孤独、战败后德国地位之低落、贫困，更在他的潜意识里结晶了疯狂的怨恨的种子，所以当希氏这次发动二次大战的初期，德国有那迅速惊人的成功，当然不是偶然的。苏轼有言：“用兵当用其翻然勃然之气。”希特勒真是充分地运用了这种“翻然勃然之气”了。（三十一年九月十五日新中国日报社论）。
    综合上述青年党的言论主张告诉我们，它是依附国外帝国主义，及国内封建军阀。在经济上主张保守封建经济制度，在政治上主张专制独裁反苏、反共、反人民、反民主的一个半殖民地封建法西斯集团。青年党这个封建法西斯集团与国民党内部的法西斯集团两者的合流，是无足奇怪的，中国有一句老话：“物以类相聚”就是这个道理。
