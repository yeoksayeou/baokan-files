　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th. General Su Yu, commander of the New Fourth Army's Central China Field Army, who commanded the Suzhong New Fourth Army's self-defense war with seven victories in seven battles, recently made the following statement on the Central China war situation after the New Fourth Army took the initiative to evacuate the two cities of Huaiyin and Huai'an (collectively referred to as "the Two Huai"):
　　Chiang Kai-shek, with the direct support of American imperialism, invaded my two cities of Huaiyin and Huai'an with four armies (now renamed divisions). This has no decisive significance for the self-defense war in Central China. Our army's withdrawal from the Two Huai is by no means a military defeat, but the beginning of a large-scale annihilation war against Chiang's army.
　　As everyone knows, the outcome of our mobile warfare is not determined by the gain or loss of one city or one place, but by the increase or decrease of our vital forces. If our vital forces are not lost, then the temporary abandonment of certain cities can disperse the enemy's forces and create conditions favorable to annihilating the enemy. For example, in Suzhong, although we temporarily abandoned Rugao and Hai'an, we annihilated more than 60,000 of Chiang's army in seven divisions. Chiang's army's invasion of the Two Huai will certainly and inevitably lead to the same results as in Suzhong. I can tell everyone that in the Central China self-defense war over the past two months or so, our main force has not only not been weakened, but has become extraordinarily strong. The number of people has increased, the weapons have been strengthened, and the technology has been improved. We have sufficient strength to defend Central China. The main force will only become bigger and stronger as it fights. Of course, we do not like to fight, but since Chiang Kai-shek has attacked, we have no choice but to fight back for self-defense.
　　Our newspapers have said: "The outskirts of Huaiyin have become the graveyard of Chiang Kai-shek's invading army." This statement will not change because of the temporary abandonment of Huaiyin. Chiang's army, which invaded Huaiyin and Huai'an, will eventually be annihilated on these lands. However, it must be clearly recognized that the self-defense war in Central China is quite long-term. Even after more than half of the troops of this offensive by the reactionaries have been annihilated, Chiang Kai-shek may organize a second and third offensive. Therefore, our main force corps should be doubly careful, bold, brave, and cautious, resolutely implement orders, and thoroughly complete the task, and annihilate the invading Chiang's army one after another. The self-defense war we are conducting is a people's war, a war to defend the people. On the one hand, all the compatriots in Central China should assist and cooperate with the main force in combat and support the front line. On the other hand, the troops and organs should pay close attention to saving the people's strength, and the military and civilians should help each other like brothers and sisters, and blend together like a family. This is the basic condition for defeating the reactionaries, and it is also our glorious tradition. We must further develop it and implement it more thoroughly. Chiang's army will be defeated, and victory belongs to the people!

### 粟裕将军纵谈华中战局  弃守两淮无决定意义  大规模歼灭战将开始

　　粟裕将军纵谈华中战局
　　弃守两淮无决定意义
　　大规模歼灭战将开始
    【新华社华中二十五日电】曾指挥苏中新四军自卫战七战七捷的新四军华中野战军司令粟裕将军，顷就新四军主动撤离淮阴、淮安（简称“两淮”）两城后的华中战局发表谈话如次：
    蒋介石在美国帝国主义直接支持之下，以四个军（现改称师）的兵力侵入我淮阴、淮安两城，这对于华中的自卫战则并没有决定意义，我军的撤出两淮，绝对不是我们军事上的失败，而是对蒋军大规模歼灭战的开始。
    人所周知，我们所进行的运动战，胜负不决定于一城一地之得失，而决定于有生力量的消长，如果我们的有生力量没有损失，则某些城市的暂时放弃，正可以分散敌人的兵力，而造成有利于消灭敌人的条件。如在苏中，我们虽然暂时放弃了如皋、海安两地，但我们歼灭了蒋军七个师六万余。蒋军的侵入两淮，也一定和必然会造成和苏中同样结果的。可以告诉大家，近两个多月来的华中自卫战中，我们的主力军不仅没有削弱，而且格外壮大了，人数增多了，武器加强了，技术提高了，我们是有足够力量保卫华中的。主力军只会愈打愈大，愈打愈强。当然，我们并不喜欢打仗，但是蒋介石既然打来了，我们为了自卫，便不得不还手。
    我们的报纸上曾说过：“淮阴郊外已成为蒋介石进犯军的坟墓”，这句话并不因淮阴城的暂时放弃而有所改变，侵入淮阴、淮安的蒋军，终必被歼灭在这些土地上的。但是，必须认识清楚，华中的自卫战是相当长期的，就是歼灭了反动派这次进攻的半数以上部队以后，蒋介石可能再组织第二次、第三次的进攻，所以我们的主力兵团应加倍细心胆大、勇敢谨慎、坚决执行命令，彻底完成任务，要一次接一次的歼灭进犯蒋军。我们所进行的自卫战是人民战争，是保卫人民而战，一方面全华中的同胞都应协助与配合主力作战，支援前线，而部队机关尤应切实注意节省民力，军民互助如手足，融洽如一家，这是战胜反动派的基本条件，也是我们的光荣传统，必须更加发挥，执行得更彻底，蒋军必败，胜利是属于人民的！
