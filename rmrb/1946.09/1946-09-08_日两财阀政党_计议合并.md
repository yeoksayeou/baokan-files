Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th -- According to the Yomiuri Shimbun on the 3rd: The two reactionary political parties of Japan's major financial zaibatsu, the Liberal Party supported by Mitsui and the Progressive Party supported by Mitsubishi, are currently planning a merger. It is reported that the two parties have reached a compromise plan: (1) The new party will adopt "Liberal" as its name; (2) Shigeru Yoshida will serve as president, and Kijūrō Shidehara will serve as the supreme advisor; (3) After the merger, all reactionary forces will be united to support the Shigeru Yoshida cabinet until Japan signs a peace treaty with foreign countries. Furthermore, it is widely rumored in Tokyo press circles that Hikosaku Yamamoto, the leader of the Cooperative Democratic Party, has a loan contract with the Mitsui zaibatsu, and his industries have been attached to the Mitsui system. Therefore, he is persuading the party's leaders to participate in the new party formed after the merger of the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party.

　　日两财阀政党
    计议合并
    【新华社延安五日电】据读卖新闻三日载：日本两大金融财阀的反动政党、三井支持下的自由党与三菱支持下的进步党，目前正在计议合并。据悉两党已获取妥协的方案为：合并后采用“自由”为新党名称；（二）吉田茂充任总裁，币原任最高顾问；（三）合并后集结一切反动势力协力支持吉田茂内阁，直至日本对外签订和约时为止。又东京报界盛传协同民主党党魁山本彦实，因与三井财阀有借贷合同关系，其产业已附属于三井系统之下，因而正说服该党各派首脑参加自由党与进步党合并后的新党。
