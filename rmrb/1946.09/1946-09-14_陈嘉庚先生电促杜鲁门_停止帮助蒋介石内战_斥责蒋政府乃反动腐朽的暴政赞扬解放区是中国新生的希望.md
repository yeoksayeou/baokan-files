　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Singapore dispatch: Mr. Tan Kah Kee, leader of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and chairman of the Southeast Asian Overseas Chinese Relief Fund, yesterday cabled U.S. President Truman and Marshall and Stuart, urging the United States to cease all aid to Chiang Kai-shek, pointing out that such aid enables Chiang Kai-shek to wage civil war unscrupulously. The cable stated: The Chiang Kai-shek government of the past twenty years "is a corrupt tyranny, characterized by deception, misdeeds, and reactionary hegemonic tendencies." Mr. Tan also said: In his contacts with important officials of the Chiang government, he was convinced that these people were stupid, undemocratic, reactionary, and stubbornly opposed to all reforms, national scum. Mr. Tan praised the implementation of democracy in the liberated areas, pointing out that they are "the hope of China's rebirth." The cable demanded that the United States completely change its policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war, pointing out that today "all Chinese people, except for those of the Chiang Kai-shek faction, regard the United States with the same eyes as they once regarded Japan." It also warned: "If the United States does not stop aiding Chiang and immediately withdraw its troops from China, it will cause all the most unfavorable consequences for the United States itself."
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Tokyo delayed dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party's newspaper, "Minpo," on the 5th, devoted two-thirds of its front page to detailing the industrial city of Zhangjiakou under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The newspaper commented: "The achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhangjiakou show that they will be qualified to lead China in the future." It continued: "Many leaders in China's industrial circles place great hope in the first modern industrial city under the rule of the Communist Party, and the CCP has indeed lived up to their expectations, planning to build this city abandoned by the Kuomintang. Eighty-four percent of the large factories have now started operation, and the quality of production is no lower than when Japan occupied these factories." The newspaper also published various reports from Chinese and foreign news agencies regarding the Zhangjiakou Liberated Area, praising the various measures of the democratic government.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 9th: Changchun Dispatch: Here, one can no longer see the happy emotions of the people from last year. People walking on the street all have gloomy faces, silent and without expression. Since the beginning of summer, cholera has been prevalent. According to official statistics at the end of July, more than 300 people have died in the city. In the various towns and villages under its jurisdiction, the number of deaths from July 23rd to the end of August, within a month, has reached more than 8,800. The Kuomintang authorities not only turn a deaf ear to this serious death of the people but are also busy with emergency grain and conscription, forcibly requiring the people of Changchun to bear 10,000 bags of military grain and implementing the conscription system of the puppet Manchurian era of "all men aged 18 must be conscripted into the army." Another thing the authorities are busy doing is using fascist terror to wantonly trample on the people's human rights. No one can guarantee that he will not be arrested at any time on the grounds of being a "communist bandit." A letter to the Xiangchao Daily signed by Mingxiong stated: He went to see an arrested friend on August 3rd. He was imprisoned in a secret dungeon, where there were more than 70 people who had been falsely accused of being "communist bandits," living an inhuman life. During the cholera epidemic, only raw water was available to quench their thirst, and the ground was dirty and damp, but they were not allowed to wear shoes. Even Japanese war criminals can have friends, but here, relatives and friends are not allowed to visit or send clothing and food. As for the prisoners in the police station's detention center, the situation is no different. Due to the recent large number of people, the food is insufficient. Only 40 yuan in circulating currency is issued each day, and after the guards extract a portion for their own pockets, there is little left. The bureau also does not allow prisoners to go out to buy food, and people starving to death are heard of every day. The battle for houses in the city is still ongoing. At least seven or eight government agencies are investigating and sealing an enemy puppet factory or house, and each government agency's investigation is carried out more than once. It is said that this is still a "legitimate procedure approved by the government." As for seals with phrases such as "Staff Quarters of ×× Bureau" or "Residence of ×× Official," they are too numerous to count, and each seal is stamped with a clear official seal.

　　陈嘉庚先生电促杜鲁门
    停止帮助蒋介石内战
    斥责蒋政府乃反动腐朽的暴政赞扬解放区是中国新生的希望
    【新华社延安十日电】新加坡讯：南洋华侨领袖，东南亚华侨筹账总会主席陈嘉庚先生，于昨日致电美国总统杜鲁门及马歇尔、司徒雷登，敦促美国停止一切对蒋介石的帮助，指出这种帮助使蒋介石肆无忌惮地大打内战。电文中称：二十年来的蒋介石政府，“是腐朽的暴政，以欺骗劣迹及反动成性的霸权为其特征”。陈氏并说：在他与蒋政府的重要官员的接触中，使他深信这些人都是愚蠢的，不民主的，反动的，并顽固的反对一切改革的民族败类。陈氏对解放区实行民主备加赞扬，指出为“中国新生的希望”。电文中要美国彻底改变援蒋内战的政策，指出今天“除了蒋介石一派的人们以外，中国人无不以过去看待日本的眼光看待美国”。同时警告说：“如果美国不停止援蒋和自中国即时撤退美军，将会引起最不利美国本身的一切恶果。”
    【新华社延安十一日电】东京迟到消息：日本社会党机关报《民报》，于五日在第一版上用三分之二的篇幅详述中共治理下张家口工业城市。该报评称：“中国共产党在张家口的成就，显示着他们将来有资格领导中国。”继称：“中国工业界不少领袖对共产党治理下的第一个现代工业城市寄以极大希望，而中共也确不负他们的希望，正有计划的建设这个被国民党所遗弃的城市，现有百分之八十四的大工厂已开工，生产质量均不低于日本占有这些工厂的时候。”该报并刊登中外通讯社有关张垣解放区的各种报导，对民主政府的种种措施，称赞备至。
    【新华社哈尔滨九日电】长春通讯：这里再也看不到去年人民快乐的情绪，在街上走的人，都愁眉苦脸，无声无息。入夏，虎疫（霍乱）流行，据官方七月底统计：市内已死亡三百余人，所属各乡镇，自七月二十三日至八月下旬一个月内，死亡数字竟达八千八百多人。国民党当局不但对人民这种严重的死亡置若罔闻，还忙于紧急征粮征丁，强要长春人民负担军粮一万包，并实行“凡十八岁男子均须被征入伍”的伪满时代征兵制。当局忙于做的另一件事，是以法西斯恐怖统治来恣意摧残老百姓的人权，任何一个人都不能担保他自己不被按上“奸匪”名义而随时被捕。一个署名明雄的投书湘潮日报说：他于八月三日去看一个被捕的友人，他被幽禁在一所秘密的地窑里，那里共有被人诬告为“奸匪”的七十多人，都过着非人的生活，在虎疫猖獗时，只有生水止渴，地上肮脏潮湿，却不许穿鞋，甚至于日本战犯可以有朋友、而这里却不许亲友探亲及送衣食。至于警察局拘留所的犯人，情况也与此无异，该局因最近人数过多，食粮不够，每日仅发给流通券四十元，除看守抽出一部擅入私囊外，所剩无几。该局又不许犯人出街买饭，饿死者日有所闻。市内房屋争夺战仍在进行中，一座敌伪工厂或房屋至少有七八个官衙调查贴封，而每个官衙的调查都不止一次，据说这还是“官准立案的合法手续”。至于贴“××局员工舍”、“××官长住宅”之类的封条，更是不胜枚举，并且每一个封条都盖着鲜明的官印。
