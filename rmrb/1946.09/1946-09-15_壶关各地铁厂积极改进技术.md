　　Iron Factories in Huguan Actively Improve Technology
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 7th] Workers and factory management in iron factories throughout Huguan are enthusiastically and actively improving technology. The iron smelting cupolas in the villages of Ma'an and Chengzhai have been retrofitted with waterwheel bellows. Originally, hand-pulled bellows produced only 200 catties of iron per furnace. Now, with the waterwheel bellows, the first test in Ma'an village yielded 300 catties from one furnace. In the past, pulling the bellows required four people per night, but now only two are needed. This success has greatly encouraged the workers and factory to enthusiastically develop towards machine industry. Iron factories in all villages are now trying to retrofit their bellows, and the capitalists are even more excited about this because increased production is more profitable.

　　壶关各地铁厂积极改进技术
    【本报长治七日讯】壶关各地铁工厂工人与厂方正热心积极的改进技术，马鞍及城寨两村铁厂炼矿方炉均已改装车轮风箱。原手拉风箱每“每炉仅产生铁二百斤，现车轮风箱在马鞍村第一次试用，一炉即产三百斤。过去拉风箱每夜需四人，现在只需两人，这一成功大大鼓励了工人与厂方向机器工业发展的热忱，各村铁厂现均在设法改装，资方对此更感兴奋，因为产量增大，更加有利可图。
