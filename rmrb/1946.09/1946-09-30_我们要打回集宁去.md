　　We Want to Fight Back to Jining

    From the day Jining was liberated, the citizens of Jining developed a deep love for the Eighth Route Army. When Fu Zuoyi's army invaded the Southern Suiyuan Liberated Area this time, the citizens wrote letters to the Eighth Route Army one after another. A group of elementary school students wrote in their letter: "Mom says you are like big brothers, and my little sister says you are like little brothers. Let's kill these ants (referring to Fu's puppet army) together!" The whole city's army and people were boiling. At dawn on October 10th, Fu's puppet army, under the cover of American-made planes and artillery, fiercely attacked the city of Jining. The Eighth Route Army commanders bravely repelled the invaders ten or twenty times from the trenches and positions. Fu's army left corpses all over the mountains and fields. After fighter Zhao Guangzhen killed more than 30 enemies with his machine gun, it suddenly malfunctioned. He then threw a total of ten grenades and small bombs, all hitting the enemy's nests. When the bombs ran out, he used a rifle. When Zhou Lei hit 42 enemies, he was injured in the foot, but he refused to leave the front line. Squad leader ×× fired more than 40 bullets in a row, and piles of enemy corpses piled up in front of the position, becoming fortifications for our army to strike the enemy. In the street fighting in Jining, only three soldiers were left in our squad. The deputy battalion commander called on the Communist Party members to defend the position to the death. So the three Communist Party members organized themselves and bombarded the enemy with grenades. Two people uncovered the grenades and passed them, and one person threw them, throwing more than 50 grenades in a row. The enemy corpses blocked the alleyways.

    During the battle, citizens, men, women, old and young, bravely assisted the Eighth Route Army in combat. The workers' pickets took charge of city patrols and repaired street fortifications. The electric wires on Shuju Street were cut off by intensive artillery fire, and the workers of the electric light factory immediately climbed ladders to connect the wires in the rain of bullets. The Catering Workers' Union put forward the slogan of cooking and delivering food to the front line, and the workers of the city's restaurants selected the best food to send. The stretcher teams fearlessly rescued the wounded. The female telephone operators of the telephone bureau set up consolation stations at the entrance, using melons and fruits to comfort the soldiers. A large banner was posted on the wall: "Glorious and brave comrades, eat watermelon." Every time a stretcher passed by, they braved the artillery fire to personally offer condolences, sending watermelon and fruits. Students, teachers, and old women competed to participate in nursing the wounded. They hired chefs to cook for the wounded. An old woman whose son was a soldier defending Jining also participated in the nursing work, taking care of the patients in the ward for several days and nights. Sewing workers in the city made 40 bolts of cloth into shirts overnight to replace the bloody clothes of the wounded. In supporting the self-defense front, the people showed unlimited love for the Eighth Route Army.

    During the battle, a large number of Fu's soldiers were captured. They were wearing short, narrow, and tattered American-style military uniforms, as dirty as beggars. Most of them were newly captured. Among them, a unit of the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion of the Seventeenth Regiment of the 17th Division was captured in May. Soldier Pei Yan of the small artillery company used to be a farmer. He didn't even know how to use a gun when he was captured. Fu Zuoyi cruelly placed these farmers on the first line of artillery fire to cover the old soldiers' charge. Fu's soldiers were forced to pull the triggers under the supervision of the supervisors and the command swords. In the middle of the night, they shouted to the Eighth Route Army: "They (referring to Fu's army supervisors) are gone, come and save me!" A unit of the Eighth Route Army transported eight such wounded soldiers across a river. Most of the officers and soldiers of Fu's army hated the war. When they were captured, their bullets were intact, a full hundred rounds. A captured officer said: "Now I completely understand that Chiang Kai-shek is the culprit of the forced civil war and dictatorship."

    Due to the reinforcements of Fu's 101st Division and the Second Cavalry Column, the defenders of Jining persisted in five days and five nights of fierce fighting under the disparity of being outnumbered, eliminating more than 3,000 invading troops. On the night of the 13th, they received an order to preserve the living forces, eliminate the enemy more effectively, and evacuate Jining. They temporarily said goodbye to the citizens. However, the people of Jining, who had experienced the slaughter and looting of Fu's army, could not bear the pain of falling into darkness again, so they supported the old and the young and followed the Eighth Route Army in retreat. A farmer carrying a stretcher held the hand of a soldier and said: "The Eighth Route Army helped me turn over and be free. We will live and die together. I want to fight Fu Zuoyi with you. Anyway, I can't suffer Fu Zuoyi's crimes anymore." The railway workers persuaded their families in a hurry, took the weapons they had seized from Fu's army, and withdrew with the army. The merchants took their money, picked up valuable goods, and followed the Eighth Route Army to transfer. The democratic government twice sought their opinions, and they replied in unison: "Don't go back! We will resolutely be with the Eighth Route Army and finally fight back to Jining City!" Their voices were loud and powerful. The people of Southern Suiyuan will never succumb to Fu Zuoyi's tyranny. They believe that Jining City will always be their own.

### 我们要打回集宁去

　　我们要打回集宁去
    从集宁解放那一天起，集宁市民就对八路军发生深切的热爱，当这次傅作义军倾巢进犯绥东解放区时，市民纷纷给八路军写信，一群小学生信上写着：“妈妈说你们像哥哥，妹妹说你们像弟弟，咱们要一起打死这些蚂蚁（指傅伪军）！”全城军民都沸腾起来了，十月十日拂晓，傅伪军在美造飞机大炮掩护下猛攻集宁城，八路军指挥员们在战壕里在阵地上神勇的十次二十次的把进犯者击溃，傅军遗尸满山遍野，战士赵广珍的机枪打死三十多个敌人后，忽然发生故障，他就投掷手榴弹小炮弹共十个炮弹，都打在敌人的窝里。炮弹完了，就使用步枪。洲雷打中四十二个敌人时足部受伤了，他仍不肯下火线，班长××一连打四十多发子弹，成堆的敌尸堆在阵地的前沿，成为我军打击敌人的工事。在集宁市街战中，我们一个班只剩下了三个战士，副营长号召共产党员至死也要坚守阵地，于是三个共产党员就组织起来，用手榴弹轰击敌人，两个人揭盖和传递，一个人投掷，连投了五十多个手榴弹，敌尸把巷口都塞住了。
    战斗中，市民男女老少都奋勇协助八路军作战，工人纠察队担任市内警戒，抢修街头工事，书街电线被密集的炮火打断了，电灯厂工人立即在弹雨中登梯接线。饭业工会提出做饭送上火线的号召，全城饭馆工人挑选最好的饭菜送去。担架队奋不顾身的抢救伤员，电话局的女电话员们在门口设立慰问站，以瓜果劳军，墙上贴着一张大幅标语：“光荣勇敢的同志们吃西瓜”。每经过一个担架，她们就冒着炮火亲往慰问，送上西瓜和果子。学生教员老太婆们争着参加看护伤员，他们请来厨师为伤员做饭，一个抗属老太太她儿子是保卫集宁的战士，自己也参加看护工作，几天几夜的在病房里招护。市内缝纫工人一夜就将四十匹布做成衬衣，给伤员换下血衣，在支援自卫前线的作战中，人民对八路军流露着无限的热爱。
    战斗中大批傅军被俘，他们穿着短窄破烂的美式军装，肮脏如同乞丐。他们大部分是新抓来的，其中十七师三团三营八连一部兵士是五月间才被抓来的，小炮连战士裴偃过去是农民，他被俘时还不会用枪，傅作义竟狠心的把这些农民放在第一道炮火线上，掩护老兵冲锋，傅军士兵在督战队与指挥刀下被迫而扳开枪机的，在半夜里向八路军高呼：“他们（指傅军督战队）走了，快来救我吧！”八路军某部在一条河上就运了八个这样的伤兵。傅军大部官兵都厌恶战争，他们被俘时子弹都是完整的一百发。一个被俘军官说：“我现在彻底明白了，蒋介石做了强行内战独裁的祸首。”
    由于傅军一○一师和骑兵第二纵队的增援，集宁的保卫者在敌众我寡的悬殊下坚持作五天五夜的激烈战斗，消灭了三千以上的进犯军后，于十三日夜半，接到保存有生力量，更有效消灭敌人，撤出集宁的命令，他们便暂时向市民告别了。但是集宁人民曾经过傅军屠杀抢劫的，他们不能忍受重陷黑暗的痛苦，都扶老携幼随同八路军撤退。一个抬担架的农民拉着战士的手说：“八路帮助我翻了身，咱们生死在一起，我要跟你们一起打傅作义，反正我不能再受傅作义的罪了”。铁路工人在仓促中说服了自己的家属，拿着从傅军手中夺得的武器，随军撤出。商人们带着钱，挑起贵重的货物，跟上八路军转移，民主政府两次征求他们的意见，他们一致回答：“不回去！坚决和八路军一起，最后打回集宁城去！”他们的声音是响亮而有力的。绥东人民永远不会屈服在傅作义暴政下，他们相信集宁城永远是自己的。
