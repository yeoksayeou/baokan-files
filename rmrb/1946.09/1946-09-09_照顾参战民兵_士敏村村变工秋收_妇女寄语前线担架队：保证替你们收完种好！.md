　　Caring for Militia Participating in the War
    Shimin Village Implements Village-Wide Labor Exchange for Autumn Harvest
    Women Send Message to Frontline Stretcher Teams: We Guarantee to Finish Harvesting and Planting for You!
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 6th dispatch] Farmers throughout the district are actively preparing for the autumn harvest and planting amidst the tense patriotic self-defense war. In order to welcome the autumn harvest, the Sixth District of Shimin is implementing large-scale labor exchange between villages and groups. After rectification, the mutual aid teams in the district have increased to 196 groups, with 1,463 full laborers and 1,312 semi-laborers, totaling 15,013 mu of land. All wheat fields have been plowed three times, and manure is currently being transported and embankments are being built. It is expected that all wheat will be planted within five days after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the autumn harvest will begin immediately. By the end of August, the Jiaochang Village mutual aid team had transported 34,300 loads of manure and built 64 wheat field ridges. The Jishe Kontan Village mutual aid team stipulates that in the autumn harvest and planting, great efforts will be made to take care of the militia who are fighting in the self-defense war: (1) The mutual aid team will allocate labor hours to the militiamen who are fighting according to their time of departure to harvest in the autumn. If their activity time is exceeded, they can return to pay back the labor hours. (2) The families of militiamen who have no labor force will be provided with drinking water and firewood in addition to helping with harvesting and planting. After most of the militia in Beichen, Fushan, set off for the war, women, children, and old men organized five mutual aid teams to take on the autumn harvest and planting in the homes of the militia, and they carefully divided the work. There are old men plowing teams, old women watching babies teams, children delivering meals teams, and young women delivering manure and building embankments teams. Shi Yuzhen, the leader of the young women's team, told Chen Weining, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, "Please send a message to our stretcher teams and tell them to take good care of the wounded! Don't worry about the crops at home, we will definitely finish harvesting and planting for everyone."
