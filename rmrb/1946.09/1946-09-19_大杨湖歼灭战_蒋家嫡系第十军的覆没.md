　　The Annihilation at Dayang Lake—The Demise of Chiang Kai-shek's Elite 10th Army
    Su Zhong
    (I)
    After the Longhai Campaign, the 3rd Division (reorganized from Chiang Kai-shek's elite 10th Army), in coordination with several other armies, frantically attacked the Jilu Yu Liberated Area. The arrogant Chiang army commander told his soldiers: "Liu Bocheng's troops are already in complete disarray." On August 31st, when the main force of the 3rd Division attacked Baimaoji, our army used the favorable terrain to give them a small "thorn." More than a hundred Chiang soldiers were needlessly sacrificed, and the commander of the 59th Division, Xiang Jiejiang, was killed in action. This small "thorn" stopped them outside Baimaoji village, and the acting regimental commander, Wu Yaodong, requested that planes and tanks be quickly dispatched for cooperation. The planes came, the tanks came, and Wu Yaodong advanced again with impunity. When they occupied Dayang Lake Mazhuang and advanced towards Dazhangji, the order from our commander also arrived: "Annihilate the main force of the invading army, the 3rd Division, at Dazhangji!" On September 3rd, Unit 6050, with less than a battalion, defended this village and withstood the enemy's fierce attacks. When our deployment was completed, the annihilation battle, changing from defense to offense, began.
    On the evening of the 5th, Unit 6053 gathered in the square next to Dongdazhuang village. Flat trajectory shells fired from the headquarters of Fang Che and Wang San Divisions constantly streaked across the silent sky, detonating violently behind the village. Opposite, in Dayang Lake village, three miles away, Chiang soldiers lit firewood, and the blazing fire illuminated the sky. At this time, Director Ouyang of the Political Department spoke to the assembled crowd, saying: "The counter-offensive in the second stage of the Longhai Campaign has been fought for two days now. Tonight's general offensive is the key to this stage. The enemy is stubborn, and we must be even more stubborn. Commander Liu has instructed us to turn the villages occupied by the enemy into a sea of fire. We must respond to this call and resolutely and stubbornly annihilate the enemy.”
    The night brought a drizzle, and the firelight from Dayang Lake village on the opposite side was even more clearly visible in the darkness. Chiang soldiers were blindly and erratically firing rifles and machine guns. Everyone listened intently, silently thinking: "Yes, in a moment, this village will turn into a sea of fire..." After Director Ouyang finished speaking, the various squads and teams whispered amongst themselves. The distribution of party work began, and individual plans were put forward. Look, Comrade Wang Shiji of the 2nd Squad hurriedly handed over his long-term savings of one thousand yuan and said: "If I sacrifice myself, it will be used as party membership dues." At the same time, he handed over his better clothes and blankets, hoping that the higher authorities would use them as prizes for the heroes who killed the enemy in this battle. He also announced his personal plan to capture a light machine gun to all his comrades. In another village, the political instructor of the 1st Battalion of Unit 6054, at this time, solemnly expressed his determination to sacrifice to his close comrade Pan Jingen: "If I sacrifice, please comfort my family on my behalf. This is three hundred yuan in gold and a pistol, please hand them over to the higher authorities." He also took out a photo and asked him to pass it on to his newlywed wife. On it, he wrote: "If the Chiang army is not eliminated, we cannot live in peace."
    (II)
    At ten o'clock on the night of September 5th, we heard the sporadic gunfire from the command post of the enemy's 59th Regiment in Dayang Lake turn into a deafening roar, and the fierce attack began. Comrade Zhu Hui, the political instructor of Unit 6054, led the 3rd Squad with nine grenades strapped to his body. He quickly crossed the deer fence, blasted through the densely arranged and sturdy hidden bunkers of the first line with hand grenades, and rushed towards the courtyard defended by the enemy. He sacrificed in the enemy's fierce fire. The platoon leader, Sun Jingui, who was advancing with him, found that only three squad leaders, Li Sanyuan, Zhang Zhishun, and Liu Xinheng, were left by his side. He roared: "Resolutely annihilate the enemy! Avenge the dead!" The fire of hatred burned in the hearts of these four men. The four of them rushed through the courtyard like four tigers and rushed to the alley entrance. The platoon leader was wounded in the head, but they still rushed forward regardless of their lives. Li Sanyuan grabbed the enemy's machine gun and was desperately fighting for it when three diehard soldiers rushed up. At this moment, the platoon leader arrived just in time and threw a grenade to seize the machine gun. They guarded the position and fired at the enemy. When they charged the enemy for the fourth time, only Liu Xinheng was left. With fire in his eyes, he used a machine gun to block the street entrance and suppressed the enemy's firepower. Suddenly, he jumped up, seized a machine gun from the enemy, and ran back to the position. The fierce battle continued. "6054" seized two courtyards. The enemy organized various light and heavy weapons and rained fire down on them, followed by a frantic charge, attempting to drive them out. The political instructor of the 2nd Battalion was wounded, the commander of the 1st Battalion was wounded, and the fierce battle continued. Company Commander Li Zhifu desperately blocked the entrance and relentlessly threw more than a hundred grenades until he shed his last drop of blood. The machine gunners were either wounded or sacrificed. The secretary of the 3rd Battalion jumped over and embraced the machine gun to fire it. Regimental Commander Lu, Political Commissar Li, and Chief of Staff Yan also fought fiercely with the enemy, holding guns. Telephone operator Hu Ransheng dropped his earphones, the medic dropped his bandages, and the bugler put down his horn. They all picked up guns and grenades to support the position, which was exchanged for the greatest sacrifices. Three tanks from the Chiang army's 3rd Division roared in, as if putting on a show. When they rushed near the commander of Unit 6054, Director Huo Zongyue, who was guarding the telephone, grabbed two grenades and shouted: "Follow me!" He was the first to pounce on the tank. The telephone operator, the guards, and the communicators also followed. In the smoke of grenades and small cannons, the infantry behind the tank retreated, and the tank retreated in a panic. When they returned to the telephone, only eight of the fifteen people were left. At dawn, Political Instructor Yu Qinghe led the 1st Squad to reinforce Unit 54. As soon as they entered the village and dug their fortifications, three giant tanks came speeding towards them again. Political Instructor Yu said to everyone: "Comrades, prepare the grenades." The tanks stopped at forty meters away and fired fiercely at them. They also gave a fierce counterattack. Fifteen minutes later, the tanks slowly retreated. Before long the enemy rushed into the village and launched a fierce assault, attempting to crush our position and break out in a coordinated attack by tanks and infantry. Squad Deputy Huo ×zhen threw grenades accurately and far. He, along with Luo Baosheng and Huang Tianshun, threw grenades fiercely at the charging enemy.

    At this time, Wang Shiji was wounded in the left arm by a machine gun. Although the wound was not light, he bit his teeth without making a sound when he saw the heavy casualties, and supported himself with one hand to fire the machine gun. The instructor saw that he was bleeding a lot and asked him to go down, but he could not be dragged away. He said, "I am afraid that the entrance to this street will not be blocked if I go down!" When the enemy broke through, he got up and chased after them. The instructor grabbed him and said, "You can't go!" He cried anxiously and said, "I haven't completed my plan to capture a machine gun yet!" Comrade Zhang Tangzhen, deputy platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon, led several soldiers to pursue the invading army that was breaking through and captured a crooked-necked machine gun and three rifles. A prisoner took out a handful of bills and a watch and gave it to him, saying, "Take it quickly, I just want the gun." At this time, Political Instructor Yu Qinghe also jumped out of the shelter early and chased the Chiang soldiers carrying machine guns not far in front of him, shouting, "Don't run! Surrender and live!" The enemy turned around and aimed at him when he saw that he was empty-handed, and fired. He bent over and rushed forward, twisting the enemy into a ball. He tried to grab the machine gun, but the Chiang soldiers refused to let go. Seeing that another fleeing soldier was holding a bayonet and stabbing at him, he was so anxious and angry that he desperately bit the Chiang soldier twice before seizing the machine gun. When it dawned, six Chiang planes flew in, but the battle was over. Those who had just laid down their weapons hid with us, unwilling to let the planes find their target. A prisoner asked me: "Which unit are you from?" I said, "Liu Bocheng's. Have you heard of it?" He nodded and said, "I have nothing to say about being defeated by him." Another prisoner said, "Our unit is considered stubborn, but who knew you were even more stubborn. This time, our regiment is finished, the 20th Brigade is also finished, and the 3rd Division is finished!" I said: "There is no reason for you to fight. The Eighth Route Army is the people's army. It fights for the interests of the people. Everyone fights bravely. No matter whether it is the 19th Route Army in the past or the 30th and 40th Armies later, although they are also called iron armies, when they are under the command of reactionary officers to massacre the people and fight in civil wars, they will lay down their weapons in front of the people's army. You are the same."

　　大杨湖歼灭战——蒋家嫡系第十军的覆没
    苏众
    （一）
    陇海战役后，第三师（蒋介石嫡系第十军改编的）配合其他几路大军疯狂的向冀鲁豫解放区进攻，狂妄的蒋军指挥官向他士兵说：“刘伯承部已溃不成军了。”八月三十一日，当第三师主力进攻白茅集时，我军利用有利地形给了他一个小“钉子”，一百多蒋军遭了无谓的牺牲，第三师主力五十九师长向介江阵亡。这个小“钉子”使他们停止在白茅集村外不敢动了，代理团长吴耀东要求赶快派飞机坦克来配合作战。飞机来了，坦克来了，吴耀东又有恃无恐的前进了。占了大杨湖马庄向大张集前进时，我们司令员的命令也来了：“要在大张集歼灭进犯军主力第三师！”九月三日，六○五○部队，以还不足一个营的兵力就把守了这个村庄，抵住了敌人猛烈的进攻。当我布署就绪，转守为攻的歼灭大战就展开了。
    五号黄昏，六○五三部队集结在东大庄村边的广场上，从方车、王三师师部打出来的平射炮弹，不时划过静寂的天空，在村后剧烈的轰响着。对面三里地的大杨湖村，四周蒋军燃着了木柴，熊熊的大火映红了那边的天空，这时政治处欧阳主任向集结的人群讲话了，他说：“陇海战役第二阶段的反击战，我们已打了两天了，今天晚上的总攻是这一阶段的关键，敌人顽强，我们要更顽强。刘司令员指示我们要把敌人侵占的村子打成一片火海，我们一定要响应这一号召，坚决顽强的消灭敌人。
    夜色带来了细雨，对面大杨湖村的火光更清楚的显在黑夜里，蒋军在盲目的零乱的打着步枪、机枪。大家凝神静气的听着，默默的想：“是的，一会这村庄就要变成火海的……”欧阳主任的话讲完了，紧接着各分队小队这一堆那一群的窃窃私语着。党的分工开始了，各个人的计划提出来了，看吧，二小队王世记同志急忙交出了他长久的积蓄一千元，又说：“假如我牺牲了就作为党费。”同时，他交出了他较好的衣服毯子，希望上级作奖品奖给此次战役的杀敌英雄；还向全体同志宣布了他个人的计划，要缴一挺轻机枪。在另一个村子，六○五四部队一营教导员，这时他正向他的亲密战友潘金根同志严肃的表示了牺牲决心：“我牺牲了请代为安慰我的家；这是三百元关金和一枝手枪，请替我交上级。”他又拿出了一张像片，要他转给他新婚的妻子。他在那上面写着：“蒋军不消灭，我们不能过安静的日子。”
    （二）
    九月五日夜间十点钟的时候，我们听见大杨湖敌五十九团指挥部断续的零星的枪声变成了震天动地的一片怒吼，凶猛的攻击战展开了。六○五四部队教导员朱辉同志，浑身带了九个炸弹率领三小队很快的跨过鹿寨，用手榴弹开路冲过密布的坚固暗堡第一线，一股劲扑到敌人据守的大院时，在敌人猛烈的火网中牺牲了，跟他前进的排长孙金贵，发现他身边只剩下和他一起的三个班长李三元、张至顺、刘新恒时，他吼叫着：“坚决消灭敌人！为死者复仇！”仇恨的火燃烧着他们四个人的心，四个人像四只虎似的冲过院子，冲到胡同口上。排长头部挂彩了，他们仍奋不顾身的冲过去。李三元抓住了敌人的机枪正拚命争夺时，三个顽军冲来了，恰巧这时排长赶到，扔去了一个炸弹才夺了机枪，他们就守着阵地向敌人扫射起来。当着他们第四次向敌人冲锋时，只剩下刘新恒一个人了，他眼睛冒火用机枪堵住街口扫射起来，压住了敌人的火力，突然他跳起来，从敌人手里夺了一挺机枪跑回阵地。恶战剧烈的进行着，他们“六○五四”夺取了两个院落，敌人组织各种轻重火器，骤雨似的朝他们打来，接着是疯狂的冲锋，企图把他们逐出去。增援的二营教导员负伤了，一营长伤了，恶战仍继续着。七连长李智富拚命堵住口子不停歇的打了一百多个炸弹，直到他流尽最后的一滴血。机枪手都负伤了或牺牲了，三营书记跳过去抱住机枪打起来。卢团长、李政委、颜参谋长也拿着枪与敌人恶斗着，电话员胡染生丢了耳机，卫生员放下绷带，司号员放下号，都拿起枪和炸弹支持着用最大牺牲换来的阵地。从蒋军第三师师部三辆坦克示威似的吼着冲来了，当它冲到六○五四的指挥员附近时，守在电话机旁的霍宗岳主任，抓起两个手榴弹高喊着：“跟我冲呀！”首先向坦克扑去，电话员、警卫员、通讯员也跟着冲过去了。在手榴弹和小炮的烟雾里，坦克后面的步兵溃退了，坦克也慌张的退回去了。他们回到电话机旁时，十五个人只剩下八个了。拂晓时，于教导员清河同志，率领一小队增援五四部队，他们进入村里刚挖好工事，三辆巨型坦克又驰来了。于教导员向大家说：“同志们，准备手榴弹。”坦克驰到四十米达处不动了，向他们猛烈射击着，他们也给以猛烈的反击，十五分钟后，坦克慢慢的退走了。不一会冲来村里的敌人，发起了猛烈的冲锋，企图在坦克和步兵夹击下，摧垮我阵地突围。班副霍×振，手榴弹打得又远又准，他同罗保生、黄天顺用手榴弹向冲锋的敌人猛烈的投着。
    （三）
    这时王世记左膊被机枪打伤了，虽然彩不轻，可是他见伤亡重就一声不叫的咬住牙，用一只手支持着打机枪。指导员见他血流的多，要他下去，可是拖也拖不走。他说：“我下去了怕这街口封锁不住啊！”当敌人突围时，他爬起来就追，指导员一把拖住他说：“你去不得！”他急的哭了说：“我还没完成缴机枪计划呀！”二排副张棠珍同志，带领几个战士向突围的进犯军追去，缴了一挺歪把子机枪、三支步枪。一个俘虏掏一把票子，一个表给他，他说：“你快带上吧，我只要枪。”这时教导员于清河同志，也早跳出掩体向他前面不远抗机枪的蒋军一面追击，一面喊：“不要跑！缴枪不杀！”敌人回过头来见他赤手空拳就向他瞄准射击，他一湾腰猛的窜过去，扭住敌人滚成一团，他去夺机枪蒋军死也不放，眼看另一个溃兵端着刺刀向他刺来了，他又急又气就拚命的咬了蒋军两口才夺过机枪来。天明的时候，六架蒋机飞来，战斗已结束了。那些刚放下武器的人与我们躲在一起，不愿让飞机发现目标。一个俘虏向我问：“贵军是那部分？”我说：“刘伯承的。听说过吗？”他点着头说：“败在他名下我没说的。”另一个俘虏说：“我们这部队就算顽强了，那知你们更顽强。这一下，我们这团完了，二十旅也完了，第三师也就完了！”我说：“你们打仗是没有道理的。八路军是人民的军队，他是为人民利益而打仗的，个个英勇作战，不管是过去的十九路军也好，后来的三十军、四十军也好，虽然他也号称啥铁军，但当着他在反动官长指挥之下屠杀人民，打内战时，他就会在人民军队的面前放下武器的，你们也是一样。”
