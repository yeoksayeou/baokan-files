　　Wu'an Fujishi Industrial Cooperative
　　Donates Money to Comfort Troops
    [This newspaper reported on the 25th] All employees of the Wu'an Cishan Fujishi Industrial Cooperative have been actively increasing their voluntary work to save materials for comforting the soldiers at the front. Health worker Xu Desheng donated 1,000 yuan. Many workers competed to donate work and money. Zhang Yimin, a newly joined laborer, was very poor, but he still insisted on donating 500 yuan of his wages. He said, "Without the protection of the Eighth Route Army at the front, we poor people would not be able to live a good life; I am afraid we would not even have enough to eat, so I want to comfort the Eighth Route Army." In a short period, the entire staff of the cooperative has donated 75,000 yuan.

　　武安福记实业社
　　献金劳军
    【本报二十五日讯】武安磁山福记实业社全体职工，纷纷增加义务工，以节约物资慰劳前方将士，卫生员徐德胜献金一千元。许多工人争先献工献金，一个新参加的民夫张一民很穷，但他仍坚持要献出工资五百元。他说：“没有前方八路军保护我们，我们穷人就不能过好时光，恐怕连饭都吃不上，所以我要慰劳八路军。”在短短的时间中，全社职工已献出七万五千元。
