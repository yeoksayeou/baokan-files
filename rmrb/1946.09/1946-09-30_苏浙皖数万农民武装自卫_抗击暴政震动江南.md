Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 26th: Tens of thousands of people's self-defense forces are conducting actions against the Kuomintang's oppressive rule in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, shaking the entire Jiangnan region. Since March, Jiangnan farmers, unable to bear the reactionaries' exorbitant taxes and levies, have spontaneously taken up the weapons they used to fight the Japanese invaders and established self-defense forces in groups of hundreds and thousands. The larger forces are active along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, the Taihu Lake region, the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the Siming Mountains in eastern Zhejiang, the coast from Dinghai to Taizhou, and the Yandang Mountains on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, creating a formidable presence.

According to the Beiping Xinsheng Bao (New Life Daily) on August 24th, a people's armed force of more than 300 people has been formed at the junction of Yixing, Guangde, and Changxing counties on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In mid-August, they captured three machine guns and more than 30 rifles from the Jiang army in Dajian Township and Daibu Town, Yixing County. Under their influence, hundreds of people from the Huzha Town Self-Defense Force in Yixing County, the Zhangzhu District Office Joint Defense Team, and the Shijie Township Self-Defense Force in Guangde County successively revolted and joined the guerrillas. In late August, several popular uprisings also occurred in various townships in Yixing County. On September 6th, the Huaxi Wanbao (West China Evening News) reported that this rebel armed force was "exceptionally powerful," and that some of the troops sent by Chiang Kai-shek to "encircle and suppress" them had already "mutinied," with soldiers carrying all their weapons and joining the uprising. The force is now "advancing towards Changxing County on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang."

Taihu Lake: 7,000 People's Armed Forces Establish the Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army

According to reports in newspapers such as the Dagong Bao (L'Impartial), Shen Bao (Shanghai News), and Wenhui Bao (Wenhui Daily), the people's armed forces in the Taihu Lake area have now grown to more than 7,000 people. They have raised the banner of the "Jiangnan Democratic Allied Army" and possess weapons such as rocket launchers, Thompson submachine guns, and mortars. Their area of activity covers seven counties: Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Wuxing, Changxing, and Yixing. They have established a local government in the Danshan area of Wuxi and are engaged in propaganda against Chiang Kai-shek's rule. They frequently disrupt roads and ambush military vehicles in the areas of Furong Mountain, Jiaoshan Mountain, Baiyuan Mountain, Hongshan Mountain, and Yangting between Wuxi and Suzhou.

Local teams in various counties on the Zhejiang border have also "mutinied" one after another due to the oppression of the "Central Army," with six such incidents occurring. Two groups from the Pinghu Self-Defense Brigade, one each from the Songjiang and Neixing county security teams, and part of the Wuxing and Changxing water police, totaling more than 1,000 people, have joined the people's self-defense forces with their vehicles and weapons. At the same time, hundreds to thousands of farmers in western Zhejiang are spontaneously settling accounts with corrupt officials.

In the Siming Mountain area of Yinxi, including Shangyu, Yuyao, Fenghua, Ningbo, Shengxian, Xinchang, and Cixi counties, Chiang Kai-shek conducted two "purges" after the withdrawal of the New Fourth Army's East Zhejiang Column, mobilizing the security teams of seven counties and more than seven regiments of troops to launch the so-called "Seven-Route Joint Suppression." Wherever they went, they raped, pillaged, and murdered (several villages in a certain county were completely burned down). All the farmers became targets of the purge. They broke into every farmhouse, rummaged through boxes and cabinets, killed chickens and pigs, and all the women with some looks were violated. Before leaving, they had to arrest and execute a few farmers to report their merits. The farmers, unable to endure this any longer, took up arms again to defend their homes. An armed force of several thousand people has developed in Liangnong and Shipa in Cixi County, and people's armed forces with complete weaponry are active in Shengxian County, the Siming Mountain area, and Ningbo. On July 18th, they occupied Fenghuang City in Ningbo, seizing all the weapons of the garrison, shaking the people of Yin County, Shaoxing, and Qingjiang. Their strength is great, and they have repeatedly defeated the attacks of the suppression army. Most of these weapons were captured from the attacking Jiang army. The suppression army did not have enough courage; a troop stationed in a certain county, possessing a considerable amount of weapons, transferred all of them to their "enemies" overnight. Chiang Kai-shek's two-month "suppression of bandits" in eastern Zhejiang resulted in "more bandits being suppressed," because "the farmers hate the 'purge' army, and think the officers and soldiers are more terrible than any bad people." The farmers said: "The government's purge is exactly the same as the Japanese devils' purge. When the Japanese devils came, we hid and could escape into the deep mountains, but when the officers and soldiers come, we can't even escape." Even the Dagong Bao had to criticize Chiang's army's atrocities, arguing that "today's prairie fire of banditry" is the result of the Kuomintang's "war-creating bandits, soldier-creating bandits, and official-creating bandits."

On the coast of Zhejiang, in the coastal area from Taizhou to Dinghai, fishermen and farmers, unable to survive due to the exploitation of corrupt officials, abandoned their farmland and fishing boats in large numbers and organized armed forces to "go to sea to make a living." They now possess a large number of boats. On the 30th of last month, the Dagong Bao stated that the Ningbo gang Zhang Zhiguan alone possessed more than 100 ships. They shouted the slogan "Eliminate corrupt officials and bureaucrats" and seized smuggled ships that were both official and merchant and sucking the people's blood, using them as "supplies." In fierce battles with Chiang's navy, they captured many new weapons. This armed force is growing stronger and now numbers about four to five thousand. The Kuomintang mobilized the naval office, the commissioner's office, the police teams of various counties, the security teams, and the escort teams to jointly "encircle and suppress" them, but so far without any success.

Thousands of Fishermen on the Coast of Zhejiang Organize Armed Resistance Against Corrupt Officials

In the Yandang Mountains on the border of Zhejiang and Fujian, the Kuomintang carried out several massacres of the people, arousing popular uprisings in vast areas. According to the Wenhui Bao, since the magistrate of Pingyang County adopted the method of "starting with beheadings" and killed one or two hundred so-called "troublemaking bandits," the "troublemaking bandits" in Pingyang and Taishun have become more and more rampant. The people's armed forces now active in the Pingtai area have joined forces with some armed forces in Fujian to carry out "anti-encirclement" guerrilla warfare, and more than 1,000 people have moved into the mountains, lurking by day and coming out by night, drifting aimlessly. They avoid fighting formal troops, so when the suppression comes to the east, they go west, and it is impossible to suppress them for a while. Even the newly appointed pacification commander of the Zhejiang-Fujian border area, Zhong Xuetang, admitted that he was powerless to accomplish his task.

### 苏浙皖数万农民武装自卫  抗击暴政震动江南

　　苏浙皖数万农民武装自卫
　　抗击暴政震动江南
    【新华社延安二十六日电】数万民众自卫武装，在苏浙皖一带进行抗击国民党虐政之行动，震动了整个江南。三月份以来，江南农民因不堪反动派苛征暴敛，就自动拿起从前与日寇作战的武器，成千整百的建立起自卫武装。较大者活动于京沪沿线、太湖流域、苏浙皖边境、浙东之四明山区、定海至台州海岸以及浙闽边境之雁荡山脉一带，声势浩大。
    据八月二十四日北平新生报载：苏浙皖边境宜兴、广德、长兴三县交界处已组成一支三百余人的人民武装，曾于八月中旬卤获宜兴县属大涧乡、戴埠镇等地蒋军机枪三挺，步枪三十余支。在他们影响之下，宜兴县属湖汊镇自卫队、张渚区署联防队、广德县属誓节乡自卫队，其数百人，先后起义，加入游击队。八月下旬，宜兴县属各乡镇亦有民变数起。九月六日，华西晚报报导该部民变武装“声势异常浩大”，蒋介石派往“围剿”之军队，部分业已“哗变”，士兵携全部枪械投入起义队伍中，现该部“正向苏浙交界之长兴县进攻”。
            太湖七千民众武装成立江南民主联军
    另据大公报、申报、文汇等报纸报导，太湖区域之民众武装，现已发展至七千余人，他们树立了“江南民主联军”的旗帜，且有火箭炮和汤姆式冲锋枪、迫击炮等武器，活动地区遍及苏州、无锡、吴江、嘉兴、吴兴、长兴、宜兴七县，并在无锡境内之丹山一带建立地方政权，展开反对蒋介石统治之宣传，在无锡、苏州间之芙蓉山、胶山、白垣山、鸿山、杨亭一带，不时进行破路及伏击兵车。
    浙江边境各县之地方团队，因不堪“中央军”压迫，亦纷纷“哗变”，前后已有六起之多——平湖自卫大队两批，松江、内兴县属保安队各一批，吴兴、长兴水警各一部共千余人，携带车武器一部，参加人民自卫队伍。与此同时，浙西一带数百以至数千农民，自动进行清算贪官污吏。
    在鄞西四明山区域，包括上虞、余姚、奉化、宁波、嵊县、新昌、慈溪等七县，自新四军浙东纵队撤退后，蒋介石进行两次“清乡”，动员了七县保安队及七个团以上的兵力，发动了所谓“七路会剿”，所到之处，奸淫烧杀（某县的几个村庄全部烧光了），所有的农民都成为清乡的对象，他们闯入每一农家，翻箱倒箧，杀鸡宰猪，稍有姿色的妇女，全被蹂躏，临走还一定要捉几个农民枪毙了，回去报功。农民忍无可忍，又重新拿起武器，保卫家乡。在慈溪县属梁弄、石帕发展了一支数千人的武装，嵊县、四明山境、宁波境内均有枪枝齐备之人民武装活动。七月十八日，曾攻占宁波之凤凰市，缴获驻军全部枪枝，震动了鄞县、绍兴、清江一带之人民，其实力强大，屡挫进剿军之进攻。这些武器，大部是从进剿蒋军手中缴获的。进剿军并没有足够的勇气，驻某县的一支军队，拥有相当可观的武器，一晚上竟全部转移到他们的“敌人”手中去了。蒋介石在浙东两月的“剿匪”，结果是“越剿越多”，因为“农民们在恨‘清乡’的军队，认为官兵比任何坏人可怕得多”。农民们说：“政府的清乡和日本鬼子的清乡完全一样，日本鬼子来了，我们躲，可以逃出深山，但是官兵来了，我们连逃也逃不了。”关于蒋军的兽行，连大公报也不得不予以指斥，认为“今日匪势的燎原”，是国民党的“战争造匪、兵造匪、官造匪”的结果。
    在浙江沿海，台州至定海的沿海地带，渔民与农民因被贪官污吏压榨无法过活，大批放弃耕地与渔船，组织武装“下海谋生”，现在拥有大量船艇。上月三十日，大公报称：仅宁波帮章志关部就拥有船百余艘，他们喊出“铲除贪官污吏”的口号，夺获亦官亦商吮吸人民脂膏的走私船只，作为“给养”。在与蒋家海军的激战中，夺获了许多新式武器，这支武装日益强大，现在约有四五千之众。国民党动员了海军处、专员公署、各县警察队、保安队、护航队联合“围剿”，迄今一无成就。
            浙江沿海千百渔民  组织武装抗击贪官
    浙闽边境雁荡山一带，国民党进行了数次对人民的大屠杀，激起广大地区的民变。据文汇报报导：自平阳县长采取了“杀头着手”的办法，杀了一二百所谓“刁匪”以来，平阳、泰顺一带的“刁匪”就越杀越旺了，现在活动于平泰一带之民众武装已与闽境一部分武装联合起来，进行“反围剿”的游击战，且已有千余人转入山林，昼伏夜出，漂泊无定，他们避免和正式军队对战，所以剿到东面，西边走了，一时剿不清。连新任的浙闽边区绥靖指挥官钟学棠也自认力薄无法达成任务。
