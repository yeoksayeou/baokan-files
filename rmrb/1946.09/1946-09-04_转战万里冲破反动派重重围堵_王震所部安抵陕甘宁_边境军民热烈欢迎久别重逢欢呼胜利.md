Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: The troops under General Wang Zhen of the Central Plains Military Region have victoriously broken through and arrived at the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region yesterday. Since the New Fourth Army troops under Li Xiannian of the Central Plains Military Region broke through the encirclement of Chiang's army on June 29, a portion of them were pursued by Chiang's army and forced to enter southern Shaanxi. Zhu Shaozhou, Chairman of the Kuomintang Shaanxi Province, even issued a statement on August 4, openly demanding that Li's troops leave Shaanxi within a time limit. Hu Zongnan also mobilized two armies and seven divisions, together with Liu Zhi's pursuing troops, to carry out a new encirclement and annihilation. On August 9, the Executive Headquarters announced the establishment of the Ninth Executive Group's Laohekou Agreement, stipulating that both sides should immediately cease military action in situ and retreat ten miles each. The Chinese Communist Party sincerely implemented the relevant provisions of this agreement. Unexpectedly, while monitoring, Chiang Kai-shek, Zheng Jiemin, Liu Zhi, and Hu Zongnan repeatedly issued secret orders, stating "to eliminate the enemy's effective strength." However, Yu Jishi, the Kuomintang representative of the Ninth Group, suddenly announced at a meeting in Xi'an on August 24 that the Laohekou temporary agreement had lost its validity after August 13 and refused to make any mediation. Thus, the 90th Division (formerly army) under the command of Hu Zongnan, the 61st, 28th, 84th, 24th, 44th, 1st, 123rd, and 27th Brigades (formerly divisions), the 135th Brigade and 64th Brigade (both formerly divisions) of the 15th Division (formerly army) under the command of Sun Zhen of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters' Fifth Pacification Zone, the 3rd Brigade and 20th Brigade of the 33rd Division, the 104th and 124th Brigades of the 41st Division, the 125th Brigade of the 47th Division, and approximately 100,000 to 120,000 troops from the 66th Division, 185th Division, and 67th Division began a fierce "encirclement and annihilation" in an attempt to eliminate our troops breaking through in southern Shaanxi in one fell swoop. Under the close "suppression," pursuit, attacks, and blockades by Chiang's army, the troops under General Wang Zhen were forced to continue breaking through, overcoming all difficulties, and finally arrived at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. When the troops crossed the Baoji-Fengxiang Road, more than a hundred of their wounded and sick were brutally murdered by Hu's troops. In Guanshan, which belongs to Long County, they encountered rain during their journey, and the soldiers slept in the rain. One day, they only had raw corn to eat, but the commanders and fighters still fought bravely; while Chiang's side was in chaos, and Sun Zhen's army lost more than a thousand men in less than a month. When Hu Zongnan's First Brigade (formerly a division) arrived in southern Shaanxi, our side had already moved to the side of the Baoji-Fengxiang Road. Hu's troops then hurriedly used a hundred military vehicles to transport their troops to Xianyang, to no avail, and the soldiers complained. In the breakout battles, the commanders and fighters of General Wang Zhen's troops were filled with unity and love. Once, when a grenade from Chiang's army landed near General Wang Zhen, a soldier immediately rushed forward to cover the grenade, and another soldier lay down on General Wang Zhen's body. The former heroically died, and the latter was also wounded, so Comrade Wang Zhen was fortunate enough to be safe. Such a story of lofty revolutionary friendship is too numerous to be fully described.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: At 4:00 PM yesterday, the troops under General Wang Zhen, who broke through from the Central Plains, safely arrived at the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Commander Huang of the border garrison troops, on behalf of the Party, government, military, and civilians, went to welcome them. The masses in nearby villages and towns and the border guards all lined up to warmly welcome them. When the Central Plains' patriotic soldiers met with the elders of the border region and their brother soldiers, they were so excited that they shed tears. In the long-awaited cheers of victory, there was a deep hatred for the fascist persecution. Although General Wang Zhen had traveled ten thousand li, his spirit was still vigorous, just like his heroic spirit when he marched south during the Anti-Japanese War. But when he was embraced by his comrades, tears welled up in his eyes, and his emotions were so suppressed that he could not speak. That night, local communities hosted a banquet for General Wang Zhen and all the officers and soldiers to celebrate their arrival, and they raised their glasses to wish Chairman Mao good health. At the banquet, General Han Dongyi jokingly said to General Wang Zhen: "Now you can send a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, saying that Wang Zhen has arrived!" Not long ago, Chiang Kai-shek had offered a reward of three million yuan to capture General Wang Zhen alive.

　　转战万里冲破反动派重重围堵
    王震所部安抵陕甘宁
    边境军民热烈欢迎久别重逢欢呼胜利
    【新华社延安一日电】中原军区王震将军所部已胜利突围，于昨日抵达陕甘宁边区边境。溯自六月二十九日中原新四军李先念部队突破蒋军包围后，其一部遭蒋军追击被迫进入陕南。国民党陕西省主席祝绍周竟于八月四日发表谈话，公然限期李部离陕，胡宗南并调集两个军七个师联合刘峙之追击部队进行新的围歼。八月九日，执行部宣布第九执行小组成立老河口协议，限双方各就原地立即停止军事行动，并各须后撤十英里。中共方面即诚意执行此一协议的有关条款，不料与监视同时，蒋介石、郑介民、刘峙、胡宗南皆连发密令，说“要消灭匪军有生力量”。而第九小组蒋方代表喻济时竟于八月二十四日在西安开会时突然宣布老河口临时协议至八月十三日后已失去效用，并拒作任何调处。于是由胡宗南指挥之九十师（原军改称）六十一、二十八、八十四、二十四、四十四、一、一二三、二十七等八个旅（原师改称），郑州绥署第五绥区孙震所指挥之十五师（原军改称）一三五旅、六十四旅（均原师改称）三十三师之三旅、二十旅，四十一师之一○四、一二四旅，四十七师之一二五旅，及六十六师、一八五师、六十七师约十至十二万兵力，即开始猛烈“围歼”，企图一举消灭我陕南突围部队。王震将军所部在蒋军密布“清剿”追击、袭击及堵击下，被迫继续突围，克服一切艰险，终于抵达陕甘宁边区。当部队横越宝（鸡）凤（翔）路时，其伤病员百余惨遭胡部杀害。在陇县所属之关山时征途遇雨，战士即在雨中睡眠，有一天仅以生包谷充饥，但指战员仍奋勇作战；而蒋方则手忙脚乱，孙震有一个军在不满一月中即损失千余人。胡宗南之第一旅（原为师）开抵陕南时，我方已转移至宝凤路侧，胡部又忙用兵车百辆将所部运送咸阳，往返徒劳，军士怨声载道。在突围战斗中，王震将军所部指战员间充满团结友爱，某次蒋军手榴弹一颗落于王震将军近旁，一战士立即抢上前去压住该弹，另一战士则卧倒于王震将军身上。前者壮烈殒命，后者亦被炸伤，王震同志因此幸告安全。此种高度革命友爱可歌可泣之故事，笔述不尽。
    【新华社延安一日电】昨日下午四时中原突围部队王震将军所部安抵陕甘宁边区边境。边境驻防部队黄司令员特代表党政军民前往迎迓，附近各村镇群众和边防守卫战士都列队热烈欢迎。当中原卫国健儿与边区父老及他们的兄弟战士相见时，都兴奋得流泪。久别重逢的胜利欢呼中，渗透着对法西斯残酷迫害的仇恨。王震将军虽在万里征途中，但精神依然健旺，一如当年抗日战争中南征时之英勇气慨。但他为他的战友们所拥抱时，热泪不禁涌出，情感压抑得他说不出话来。当晚地方各界设宴为王震将军及全军将士洗尘，席间并举杯共祝毛主席健康。宴席上韩东意将军笑说王震将军：“现在你可以打个电报给蒋介石，就说王震到了！”不久以前蒋介石曾悬赏三百万元要活捉王震将军。
