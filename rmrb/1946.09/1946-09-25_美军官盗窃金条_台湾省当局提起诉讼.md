Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to a Shanghai newspaper report from August 24th, citing a United Press dispatch: Regarding the case of an American military officer stealing gold bars worth $150,000 in Taiwan, officials from the Taiwan province have now filed a lawsuit with the criminal division of the local court. It is reported that when the first group of American troops arrived in Taiwan, one of them, an army lieutenant colonel (now a civilian in the United States after retirement), received 3,992 taels of gold from the Japanese army. At the time, it was agreed by both parties that the American military officer would transfer all of these gold bars to the Chinese side in the future. Unexpectedly, the American military officer, tempted by the wealth, only transferred half of it to the Chinese government, appropriating the remaining half for himself. He then left Taiwan last autumn and came to Shanghai, where he had another American military officer exchange the 1,996 taels of gold he had embezzled. Six months later, provincial authorities, while consulting a Japanese official on a matter, inadvertently discovered the theft from the Japanese official's mouth. According to the Japanese official, the total value of the gold handed over by the Japanese army to the American lieutenant colonel was twice as much as that received by the Chinese authorities. Taiwan provincial officials then reported the matter to the U.S. military authorities, demanding the recovery of the stolen goods. Currently, except for 75 taels that remain missing, the rest have been successively identified in various gold shops and banks.

　　美军官盗窃金条
    台湾省当局提起诉讼
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据八月二十四日沪报载合众社息：关于美国军官在台湾盗窃价值十五万美元之金条一案，台省官员现已在地方法院刑事处进行诉讼。缘于首批美军开抵台湾时，其中有陆军中校一人（现在美国，已退伍为平民），自日军手中接收黄金三九九二两，当时经双方协议，此项金条日后必须由该美国军官全部移交华方，不料该美国军官见财心动，仅以半数移交中国政府，其余一半则占为己有，旋于去秋离台来沪，复经由另一美国军官兑去所吞没之黄金一九九六两。六个月后，省当局因事咨询某日本官员，无意中自该日人口中发觉此项盗案。据该日本官员透露：日军所交与美军中校之黄金，其总值倍于华方当局所接收者，台省官员遂以此事报告美军当局，要求追回赃物，目下此项赃物除其中七十五两仍下落不明外，其余均在各金店及银行中陆续查明。
