　　Short Ballads from the Frontline
    At a battle mobilization meeting, Comrade Wang Xisheng of the 7th Company of the 6050th unit handed over 400 yuan and two new sets of clothes. He said, "I am ready to sacrifice myself. I want my money to be used by the company to improve meals, and my clothes to reward heroes who kill the enemy. If I die, I only want the Eighth Route Army to have my name, Wang Xisheng, and to know that I died for the people." During the Yanlin battle, he shot down four enemies in a row. He also encouraged everyone to aim carefully and not to shoot blindly. As soon as the gunfire stopped, he shouted slogans: "I came from the Pinghan Campaign, the Eighth Route Army is very good, you come over!" During the enemy's fourth charge, he was unfortunately hit in the head by a bullet. He died beside his beloved comrades. Comrades of the Eighth Route Army! Remember the name of Wang Xisheng forever!
                                                (Yi Xiao)
    (From the Branch News) On the night of July 28th, taking advantage of the dark night, the Second Battalion of the Tongpu Detachment quietly approached the enemy's碉堡 (diaobao, blockhouse) at Yangjiashan, about five li east of the South Gate of Lingshi on the Tongpu Road. To control the South Gate and cut off the lifeblood of the Yan clique, the enemy's碉堡 at Yangjiashan had to be taken down first.
    The brave men of our Third Platoon were truly heroic. Carrying ladders, they quickly passed through the outer trenches with obstacles set up by the enemy and put the ladders against the fort wall. Look! Comrades of the First and Second Platoons, one by one, bravely climbed onto the ladders, regardless of the enemy's shooting and throwing grenades. The comrades of our First and Second Platoons were not afraid at all. Unfortunately, the ladder suddenly broke while they were climbing. The enemy immediately threw down a grenade, but the commanders and fighters' full fighting spirit was not affected in the slightest. The ladder was immediately erected again, and the brave men climbed into the fort one after another. Under such circumstances, the enemy's firepower quickly died down. How fast! In the time it takes to smoke a cigarette, the entire Yangjiashan 碉堡 was completely occupied by our army. The enemy's four light machine guns, one grenade launcher, more than thirty rifles, and more than forty prisoners all became the spoils of our Second Battalion. Our Second Battalion not only had a tradition of being good at defending in the past, but this time it also created a very beautiful attack on a fortified position.

　　火线短曲
    在战斗动员的大会上，六○五○第七连王希圣同志交出了四百块钱，两身新衣服，他说：“我要牺牲了，我的钱给连上改善伙食，衣服奖励杀敌英雄，我死了只要八路军有我王希圣一个名子，知道我是为老百姓死的就行了。”阎林战斗中他一连打倒了四个敌人，他还鼓励大家好好瞄准打，不要瞎打枪。枪声一停，他就喊口号：“我是平汉战役过来的，八路军很好，你们过来吧！”在敌人第四次冲锋的时候，他不幸头中一弹，他死在他的亲爱的战友们的身旁。八路军的同志们！要永远记住王希圣的名子呵！
                                                （弋笑）
    （同支讯）七月二十八日夜，趁着黝黑的夜色，同蒲支队二大队静悄悄的接近了同蒲路灵石南关东面约五里地的杨家山敌人的碉堡，要想控制南关，切断阎顽的大肠，首先必须要把杨家山敌人的碉堡搞下来才行。
    我们三分队的健儿们真是英勇，抬着梯子迅速的通过了敌人设有障碍物的外壕，把梯子架到堡墙上了，你看呀！一二分队的同志们，一个一个英勇的都上到梯子上，不管敌人在怎么样射击和投手榴弹，但是我们一、二分队的同志一点也不害怕。不巧正在上梯的时候，梯子忽然中断了，敌人随即扔下来一颗手榴弹，但指战员们的饱满战斗情绪丝毫未受影响。梯子马上又竖立起来，健儿们一个跟一个都爬到堡子里去了。敌人在这种情形下，火力很快便黯哑下来。真是快呀，只有吸一根烟的时间，整个的杨家山碉堡便被我军完全占领了，敌人的四挺轻机枪，一个掷弹筒，步枪三十余支，俘虏四十余，都成了我二大队的胜利品。我二大队不但过去有着善于坚守的传统，而且这一次又创造了一个很漂亮的攻坚战斗。
