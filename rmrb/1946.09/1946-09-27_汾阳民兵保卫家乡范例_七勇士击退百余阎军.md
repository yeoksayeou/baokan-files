　　Fenyang Militia Defends Hometown Example
　　Seven Heroes Repel Over One Hundred Yan Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 24th] A certain village on the edge of Fenyang in Jinzhong, where seven militiamen stubbornly resisted by relying on houses and bravely repelled more than twenty times the invading Yan troops, has been widely circulated as a good story of the Pingchuan militia defending their homes. On the 13th of this month, Yan troops of the 209th Regiment from Qinyang invaded the Dongsi and Taipingzhuang area in the north. A group of about one hundred and sixty men suddenly surrounded a courtyard in a certain village. When the invaders penetrated two courtyard gates, the seven militiamen stationed there immediately closed the third courtyard gate. With the help of the landlord of the courtyard, they all climbed onto the roof and drove the Yan troops out of the courtyard with intensive hand grenades and rifles. The landlord then picked up the rifles and hand grenades hastily abandoned by the Yan troops in the first and second courtyards to supplement the militia. The militiamen continued to calmly shoot at the Yan troops attacking from the street. None of the Yan soldiers dared to approach and open fire. An angry Yan army leader spent 90,000 yuan in legal tender to buy a soldier, ordering him to climb the roof guarded by the militia, but he was immediately knocked down by the militia with a rifle. After six hours of continuous fighting, the Yan troops retreated without gaining anything.

　　汾阳民兵保卫家乡范例
　　七勇士击退百余阎军
    【新华社兴县二十四日电】晋中汾阳边缘地区某村，七个民兵据屋顽抗，并奋勇击退二十余倍进犯阎军，已风传为平川民兵保卫家乡的佳话。本月十三日，沁阳阎军二○九团北犯董寺、太平庄一带，其中一般约百六十余人，突然包围某村一院落，当进犯者深入两道院门时，驻守该处七名民兵战斗队员，立即紧闭第三道院门，并在该院房东帮助下，一齐爬上房顶，以密集手榴弹与步枪把阎军逐出院外，房东随即将第一二两院内阎军仓惶遗弃的步枪、手榴弹拾回，补充了民兵，民兵战斗员继续沉着射击从街上进攻的阎军。阎军士兵无一敢接近开火，一阎军头目恼羞之余，用九万元法币买了一个士兵，令其攀登民兵据守之屋顶，立遭民兵以枪撩倒。在持续六小时后，阎军一无所获退去。
