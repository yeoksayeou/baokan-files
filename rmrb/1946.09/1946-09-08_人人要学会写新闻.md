　　Everyone Should Learn to Write News
    I propose that we all should learn to write news. Those of us who are engaged in revolutionary work and are literate should learn to write news, just as we should all learn to speak at meetings.
    Why? Because news is the most important and effective form of propaganda today. It can be said that if you don't learn to use this form, don't even talk about propaganda. And propaganda, of course, is the responsibility of all of us.
    Never before has there been a form of writing that can compare with today's news. In terms of the number of works and the number of readers, a single daily newspaper often contains hundreds of articles, and some daily newspapers publish several editions a day. How many daily newspapers are published in the world every day?! If you take a year, isn't that many more than all the works passed down in China since ancient times? The number of readers in the world must be calculated in the tens of millions. Even in China, there are at least several million readers a day. How could the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties have dreamed of such good fortune as we have today? None of them knew how to write news, and I wonder if their readers today could even reach ten thousand in a single day. We are born in the age of news, seeing this great opportunity, we must not let it pass in vain.
    Speaking of the benefits of writing news, there are really many. The first thing about news is that it is substantive. As long as there is something new, you can say something about it, making it known to all. Every fifth-grade student in elementary school, every soldier of the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army who knows a thousand characters, can learn to write and should learn to write. Speak long if there is something to say, short if there is nothing to say. The Party's stereotyped writing style has nothing to do with it, so when everyone learns to write news, the Party's stereotyped writing and other kinds of empty talk can become extinct. The masses are the recipients of news, and the masses are especially the creators of news. If you want to interview for news, you must go deep among the masses, and it is indispensable to be good at approaching all kinds of people in the masses. Furthermore, what exactly is a new fact? What is an important fact? What is a fact that the masses are concerned about and interested in? What goals can be achieved and what results can be created by announcing what news? All this requires observation, discrimination, and decision-making. Therefore, practicing writing news is also practicing observation, practicing investigation and research, and practicing opening your mind—thinking.
    Writing news is not only practicing observation, but more importantly, it is practicing expression. The expression of news must be both fast and accurate, both clear and concise; lacking any of these is not acceptable. This skill is like the saying, "Watching someone else carry a load doesn't seem difficult, but you don't know how hard it is until you've done it yourself." You must know that in today's rural environment, most people's speech and writing are neither fast nor accurate, neither clear nor concise, slow and sloppy, muddled, rambling. Learning to write news is exactly the right medicine. The publication of news is not only a matter of days but also of hours. This is well said in an article by Comrade Yun Yiqun. Although in Yan'an you don't need to calculate the hours of trains and airplanes, you can't avoid calculating the hours of the post office sending letters, the correspondents sending news, the newspaper publishing and typesetting, and the radio station sending and broadcasting the news. Delaying an hour often means delaying twenty-four hours. If Xinhua News Agency is delayed, the Central News Agency will not wait for you. Therefore, we must be able to write a news item in ten minutes, what is called "ready at the gallop," we must indeed develop this skill. But speed does not allow sloppiness. On this point, honestly speaking, Xinhua News Agency has a much stronger reputation than the Central News Agency! It's not that the Central News Agency can't be more accurate than us, but it often publishes many rumors, which ruins itself. Xinhua News Agency has never told lies. If it accidentally makes a mistake, it will definitely correct it. But correcting it once always indicates an inaccuracy, and besides, not preparing doesn't necessarily mean making a mistake; most of the time, it's not wrong, it's just being more orthodox in terms of time, place, name, number, noun, and adjective. As for those of us who are learning to write news, I guarantee that in the first ten news items we write, nine will make the mistake of being inaccurate. Although this problem is very harmful, it is not difficult to cure. Get the doctor to diagnose it for a few days, and you will recover and be saved. Writing clearly is much more difficult than being accurate, because people always think that things they understand are also understood by others, which makes their words always unclear. Not only are the readers and authors of news separated by thousands of miles, even if they are only separated by dozens or hundreds of miles, they live in two different worlds. When reading the news you write, they will not readily look up dictionaries, consult maps, or check various reference books, nor will they find your past works and other related news to compare and read together. All the troubles you might cause them depend on you, in your writing, caring and considerate like a lover, preventing problems before they happen. It never hurts to be polite. You should treat your readers as if they know nothing about your knowledge every time, and you will never be wrong. Therefore, you must provide them with detailed annotations, cross-sections, and longitudinal sections of the background, colors, aromas, sounds, and tastes, vividly, with witnesses and material evidence, everything complete, in your news. This is called "three-dimensional" news, which is called making it clear to people. But the problem arises again: all the vital organs are complete, but the sparrow must still be very small. Your entire work is best around one hundred words, and at most a few hundred words. If it exceeds one thousand, it becomes a long novel, which is somewhat disgusting. This is the biggest difficulty we encounter when learning to write news! Think about it, according to our habits, a meeting lasts half a day, and we write at least three thousand words at a time. How many doses of laxatives should we take for this?! But what can we do? You can only choose one thing from many: either write long and no one will read it, or compress it again and again and everyone will be willing to read it. If we develop the habit of striving for economy in speaking, lecturing, and writing, then we can do more things in a day. In this way, through the process of learning to write news, you can achieve a fast, accurate, clear, and economical method of expression. The benefits of learning to write news are so great that the effectiveness will be great.
    What else? Learning to write news also teaches us to use the narration of facts to express opinions. Of course, we want to express opinions, but the most powerful opinion is an invisible opinion—from the writing, the speaker is only objectively, faithfully, and simply narrating the facts he has seen and heard (and people's narration is always based on a certain point of view), so people feel that they are only accepting opinions from him (and everyone with self-esteem generally does not want to lightly believe opinions but prefers to believe facts). News is this kind of invisible opinion. The better the news, the better it is at implementing its own opinion in the content, and the better it is at hiding its own opinion in the form. Look at the reports of the British and American news agency reporters every day. They never say "I think this and that," "We should do this and that." It seems they are simply transparent bodies, only knowing how to report external developments. But they are actually very powerful propaganda ministers. They are fighting with their descriptive methods, arrangement methods, and even special (but not necessarily intense on the surface) compositional, sentence, and word choices. Their power lies in the fact that when they favor one side and attack the other, their faces are both "fair" and "calm." We don't pretend, because what we want to promote is only the true facts. But an overly enthusiastic expression, in this upside-down world, will actually make the truth become suspicious.
    I am convinced that we all should learn to write news. Many of us still don't know how to use news to quickly and widely spread facts, so that we only know how to use many news materials to chat, tell jokes, give speeches, write commentaries, write essays, write prose, write lyrical prose, run magazines, and publish books. This at least indicates that we are lagging behind in some aspect. News is a science and art of the times, and its development prospects are vast and boundless. If everyone learns this science and art, it will not only be of great benefit to our news work, but it will also be of great benefit to all of our work and even the work quality of every staff member.

### 人人要学会写新闻

　　人人要学会写新闻
    我提议我们人人要学会写作新闻。我们做革命工作而又能识字作文的人，都应该学会写新闻，就如同都应该学会开会说话一样。
    为什么？因为新闻是今天最主要最有效的宣传形式。可以说，不学会使用这种形式，你就不要说什么宣传。——而宣传，这当然是我们大家都有责任。
    从来没有一种文字形式能够跟今天的新闻相比。要说作品之多同读者之多，一张日报上，动不动就是上百篇，而一种日报，还有一天出好几张的，一天世界上该出版多少日报呀？！拿一年来算，不比中国自古以来所有传世之作的篇数还要多得多吗？读者在世界上要用万万来计算，就在中国，一天至少也有几百万人。什么唐宋八大家，他们那里梦想到过今天咱们这等好福气。他们就没有一个人会写新闻，他们的读者在今天一天里，不晓得能不能上一万。我们生在新闻的时代，看着这大好机会，决不能白白放过。
    说起来写新闻的好处，真是不少。新闻第一是言之有物，只要有了新的物，就能言一番，咸使闻知。每一个完小五年级的小学生，每一个识了千把字的八路军新四军战士，就都可以学着写，就都应该学着写。有话即长，无话即短，党八股同它没有缘，所以人人学会了写新闻，党八股和其他各种空话就可以绝种。群众是新闻的接受者，群众尤其是新闻的创造者。你要采访新闻，就非深入群众，善于接近群众中的各种人物不为功。再说究竟什么是新的事实？什么是重要的事实？什么是群众所关切有兴趣的事实？宣布什么新闻能达到什么目标造成什么结果？这都得要一番观察辨别决择的功夫。所以，练习写新闻也就是练习观察，练习调查研究，练习打开脑筋——思想。
    写新闻不光是练习观察，而且更要紧的是练习表现。新闻的表现是既要迅速又要准确，既要明了又要经济，缺那一项都不成。这个功夫合上两句俗语，叫做“看人挑担不吃力，事非经过不知难。”须知他们在今天的农村环境里，说话作文绝大多数正是既不迅速又不准确，既不明了又不经济，慢慢腾腾，潦潦草草，糊糊涂涂，噜噜＠＠，学写新闻正是对症下药。新闻的发表，不光是论日子而且要论钟点。这在恽逸群同志的一篇文章里说的很好。在延安虽然不要计算火车飞机的钟点，但是你总不能不计算邮局发信、通讯员送信、报馆发稿排版、广播电台送稿广播的钟点，耽搁一小时，往往就是耽搁二十四小时。假如新华社耽搁了，人家中央社可不陪着你，所以在十分钟里要能写成一条新闻，所谓“倚马可待”，我们确是要练成这副本领。但是快了可不允许马虎。在这一点上，老实说，新华社比中央社的名誉强得多！中央社不是不能比我们更准确，可是它经常发表许多谣言，这就把自己搞坏了。新华社从来没说谎话，它如果偶然闹错，一定更正。但是更正一次，总是表示一次的不准确，何况不准备不一定就是闹错，多半倒是并不错，就是在时间、地点、姓名、数目、名词、形容词这些方面正统一些罢了。至于我们学写新闻的人，管保在开始写的十条新闻里有九条犯不准确的毛病。这个毛病虽然很有害，可并不难治，多叫医生诊断几日，就会痊愈获救。写的明了却比准确难得多，因为人们总是认为自己明了的事情人家也明了，这就使自己的话总是说不明了。不但新闻的读者和作者相隔几千里几万里甚至几十万里，那怕只隔几十几百里，他就和你生活在两个天地。读你写的新闻时既不会随时翻字典看地图查各种参考书，也不会把你过去的作品和其他有关的新闻都找在一起来对读，你可能给他的各种麻烦，全靠你在写作时像情人一般的关心体贴，防患未然。礼多人不怪，你把你的读者每一次都当作对你的知识一无所知，准没有错。因此，你得在你的新闻里每一次供给他详细的注释，纵断面和横剖面的背景，色香声味，呼之欲出，人证物证，一应俱全，这样你的新闻就叫做“立体化”了，就叫做让人明了了。但是，问题又来了，五脏俱全，但是麻雀仍须很小，你的全部作品最好就在一百字上下，再多也就是几百字，如果过了一千，这就成了长篇小说，有些面目可憎了，这可是我们学写新闻所遇到的最大难关呀！想想看，按我们的习惯，一开会就是半天，一动笔至少三千，这才该服多少剂泻药呀！但是，有什么办法呢？你只能在多样里选择一样：或是写得长而没有人看，或是压缩再压缩而人人愿意看。如果我们养成说话演讲作文都力求经济的习惯，那么我们一天就可以做更多的事。就这样经过学写新闻的过程，你就能做到一种迅速、准确、明了和经济的表现方法。学写新闻的好处有如此者效力就大。
    还有呢，学写新闻还叫我们会用叙述事实来发表意见。我们当然是要发表意见，但是最有力量的意见乃是一种无形的意见，——从文字上看去，说话的人只是客观地忠实地朴素的叙述他所见所闻的事实（而人们叙述总是根据着一定的观点的），这样人们就觉得只是从他接受意见了（而每个有自尊心的人，一般都是不愿轻信意见而宁愿相信事实的）。新闻就是这种无形的意见，愈是好的新闻，就愈善于在内容上贯彻自己意见，也愈善于在形式上隐藏自己意见。你找每天英美通讯社记者的报导来看，他们从来不说“我以为如何如何”，“我们应该如何如何”，看来他们简直是些透明体，只知道报导外界的发展。但是他们实在是些很厉害的宣传部长，他们是用他们的描写方法排列方法以至特殊的（表面上却不一定是激烈的）章法句法和字法来作战的。他们的厉害，就是当他们偏袒一方面攻击另一方面的时候，他们的面貌却是又“公正”又“冷静”。我们不要装假，因为我们所要在宣传的只是真实的事实。但是过于热心的表现，这个颠倒的世界上，却反会使真实的变为可疑。
    我确信我们人人应该学写新闻，我们很多人现在还不会利用新闻来迅速广泛的传布事实，以至我们只知道把许多新闻的材料去闲谈，去说笑话，去做演讲，去写评论、写论文、写杂文、写抒情文，去办杂志去出书，这至少是表示我们在某一方面的落后。新闻是一种时代的科学，时代的艺术，它的发展前途正是辽阔无限。如果人人都学会这门科学同艺术，不但对于我们的新闻工作有极大好处，而且对于我们的全部工作乃至每个工作人员的工作品质一定都有极大好处。
