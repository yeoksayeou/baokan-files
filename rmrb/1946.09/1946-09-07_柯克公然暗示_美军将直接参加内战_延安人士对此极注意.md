Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 4th: According to a Qingdao dispatch from the Central News Agency: US Seventh Fleet Commander Admiral Kirk, while hosting reporters on his flagship on the 3rd, stated in response to inquiries: (1) US public opinion supports the government's handling of the Anping incident, and regardless of the investigation results, it will not affect the fundamental US policy towards China. (2) The mission of the US military in China is to promote peace and stability in China and to assist China in establishing its navy. (3) The United States does not want to be involved in any way in China's civil war, but this will also depend on the development of the civil war situation. There are no more Marines stationed in Shanghai, but the Navy regularly docks at ports along the Chinese coast. The aforementioned hint by Kirk that the United States is prepared to directly participate in the Chinese civil war under certain circumstances has attracted great attention from people here. Disregarding the demands of the vast Chinese and American public opinion, Truman's repeated promises, and the resolutions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, Kirk suddenly announced the two strange reasons of "promoting peace and stability in China" and "assisting China in establishing its navy" after the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners of war had already been completed, pushing the US military's presence in China to an indefinite period. Generally, there are doubts about what kind of power Kirk is based on to decide on this method of dispatching troops from one independent country to another independent country to promote peace. Because everyone knows that the army is a tool of war, and guns are weapons of killing. Whether it is the long-term stationing of US Marines in China, or the sale or "assistance to China in establishing its navy" of surplus military materials, it cannot help peace. Looking back at the year that the US military has been stationed in China, it has not only failed to play any role in promoting peace in China, but has instead fueled Chiang Kai-shek's military ambitions, and the fact that China is today plunged into a full-scale civil war is the best proof.

　　柯克公然暗示
    美军将直接参加内战
    延安人士对此极注意
    【新华社延安四日电】据中央社青岛讯：美第七舰队司令柯克上将三日在旗舰招待记者答复询问时称：（一）美舆论拥护政府对安平事件的处置办法，不论调查结果如何，均不影响美对华根本政策。（二）美军在华任务为促进中国和平与安定并协助中国建立海军。（三）美国不愿与中国内战发生任何关系，惟此亦将视内战发展之情势而定。上海已无陆战队，海军则经常停泊于中国沿海各口岸。上述柯克关于美国准备在某种情况下直接参加中国内战的暗示，引起此间人士极大注意。柯克不顾中美广大舆论的要求，杜鲁门的屡次诺言以及莫斯科外长会议决议，在遣送日俘工作业已完成之时，突然宣布“促进中国和平与安定”与“协助中国建立海军”两项奇怪的理由，把美军驻在中国推至无限期。一般对于柯克究系根据何种权力决定此种从一个独立国家派遣军队至另一个独立国家去促进和平的办法颇抱疑问。因为谁都知道军队是战争的工具，枪炮是杀人的利器，无论是美国海军陆战队长期留驻中国或以剩余军用物资让售或“协助中国建立海军”，决不能有助和平。回顾美军驻华已有一年，不仅丝毫未起促进中国和平的作用，反而助长蒋介石的军事野心，使今天中国陷入漫天烽火的大内战中就是最好证明。
