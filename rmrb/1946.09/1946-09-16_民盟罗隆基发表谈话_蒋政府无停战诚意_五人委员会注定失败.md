　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Shanghai News: Mr. Luo Longji of the China Democratic League made a statement on the 5th regarding the Five-Person Committee, stating: If the Kuomintang government does not consider the two proposals put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, then the Five-Person Committee is destined to fail, because the main purpose of the negotiations is to stop the civil war. If the Kuomintang government refuses to announce a ceasefire order after reaching an agreement on the reorganization of the government, then what is the point of further discussion? Mr. Luo also stated on the 30th of last month that the government's resolutions regarding the distribution of seats on the State Council of the reorganized government and the distribution of ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan must be decided after further discussion by the Government Group of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Luo emphasized: If the Kuomintang government truly respects the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and sincerely reorganizes the government, it should of course conduct negotiations for the reorganization of the government in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Luo said: The United States' "mediation" of the Chinese civil war is disorganized and clearly aimed at helping the Kuomintang government to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The Five-Person Group is just one example. Mr. Luo believes that if the United States truly hopes that China will achieve peace and democracy, it would be best to advise Chiang Kai-shek to respect and earnestly implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Zhang Bojun also said that the so-called informal negotiations on the reorganization of the government being conducted in Nanjing these days are in fact just a smokescreen for launching a full-scale civil war.

　　民盟罗隆基发表谈话
    蒋政府无停战诚意
    五人委员会注定失败
    【新华社延安十三日电】沪讯：民盟罗隆基氏五日对五人委员会发表谈话称：倘若国民党政府不考虑中共所提出之两项建议，则五人委员会注定要失败，因为谈判主要目的是停止内战，假若国民党政府拒绝在改组政府达到协定以后即公布停战命令，那么还有什么再谈的必要呢？罗氏于上月卅日亦曾表示政府决议中有关于改组政府国府委员会人数分配与行政院各部会分配问题，必须经过政协会议政府组继续讨论始克决定。罗氏强调指出：国民党政府如真正遵重政协决议诚意改组政府，当然应该依照政协决议进行改组政府之谈商。罗氏说：美国对中国内战之“调处”，其步骤错乱无章，显见处处在帮助国民党政府破坏政协决议，五人小组就是一个实例。罗氏认为美国如真正希望中国实现和平民主，最好是劝告蒋介石尊重并切实实行政协决议。章伯钧氏亦称日来南京进行之所谓改组政府之非正式谈判，事实上仅系进行全面内战之烟幕而已。
