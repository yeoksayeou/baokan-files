　　Our Army's Self-Defense Counterattack Advances Near Anyang
　　Eliminates a Battalion of Pseudo Cheng Daosheng
　　Large Numbers of Chiang's Army Vehicles Continue Northward Along the Pinghan Railway
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 28th dispatch] Just as a fierce battle is brewing east of Heze, the Kuomintang Central News Agency is further displaying its ability to spread rumors and confuse the public. On the 23rd, the agency's Baoding dispatch stated: The National Army in Anyang, heading north along the Pinghan Railway, has successfully crossed the Zhang River, and the vanguard is advancing towards Cixian. A spokesman for the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region pointed out that this report is a fabrication by the Central News Agency, attempting to use deception to encourage its military morale, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The spokesman continued: The actual situation is the opposite of what the Central News Agency reported. In the area south of the Zhang River and north of Anyang city, our main forces are launching a self-defense counterattack. On the morning of the 24th, a unit of our main force captured Dougong Town east of the city, capturing more than 40 Chiang's puppet troops below the rank of deputy regiment commander, and seizing light machine guns and grenade launchers. In the afternoon, more than 3,000 puppet troops from two regiments in Taibao (east of Anyang) came to aid, attacking our Jinzhang and other places. Our main force launched a counterattack and advanced to Xiaojinzhang, crossed north from Dougong, captured Jinzhang, eliminated a battalion of pseudo Cheng Daosheng, captured more than 200 people, and seized 20 light machine guns and more than 200 rifles.
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 27th dispatch] Chiang's army has been transporting troops frequently on the Pinghan Railway in recent days. Following the 75th Division, which was transferred north along the Pinghan Road and opened east in the first ten days of this month, Chiang's army transport trains continued to move north in the middle of this month, carrying more than 10,000 Chiang's troops (unit number to be determined, mostly speaking with Sichuan accents), gathered at Xiaoji Station south of Xinxiang, and have now opened east. From the 8th to the 21st, in thirteen days, in order to expand the civil war in Ji-Lu-Yu, Chiang's army dispatched a total of eleven trains fully loaded with various American-made heavy weapons, carrying 15 tanks, 57 vehicles, 30 artillery pieces, more than 1,000 shells, more than 200 boxes of bullets, 30 large barrels of gasoline, more than 400 war horses, and 8 boxes of aircraft bombs, one of which has been transported eastward.

    【本报邯郸二十八日电】正值荷泽以东地区恶战酝酿之际，国民党中央社更逞其造谣惑众之能事。二十三日该社保定电称：安阳国军经平汉线北上，刻已抢渡漳河成功，先头部队正向磁县推进。晋冀鲁豫军区发言人顷对此指出：此种报导，乃系中央社造谣，企图用欺骗鼓励其军心，与事实完全不符。发言人继称：实际情况恰与中央社报导相反，在漳河以南安阳城北地区，我军主力正展开自卫反击，二十四日上午，我主力一部已攻克城东窦公镇，俘蒋伪军副团长以下四十余人，缴轻机枪、掷弹筒各一。下午，太保（安阳东）伪军两个团三千余人出援，犯我金张等地，我主力当给以反击，乘胜挺进小金张，一部由窦公北渡，攻克金张，消灭伪程道生一个营，俘二百余人，缴获轻机枪二十挺，步枪二百余支。
    【本报长治二十七日电】平汉线连日蒋军兵运频繁。继本月上旬沿平汉路北调东开之七十五师后，本月中旬又有蒋军兵运列车陆续北开，载有蒋军万余人（番号待查，多操四川口音），集结于新乡以南之小冀车站，现已东开。自八日至廿一日十三天内，蒋军为扩大冀鲁豫内战，满载各种美制重武器之列车共十一趟，共载坦克十五辆、汽车五十七部、炮卅门、炮弹千余发、子弹二百余箱，汽油三十大桶、战马四百余匹，并有飞机炸弹八箱，其中有一部已东运。
