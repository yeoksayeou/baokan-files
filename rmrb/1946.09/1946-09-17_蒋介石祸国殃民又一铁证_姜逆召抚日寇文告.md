Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th. When the Harbin counter-revolutionary riot case was cracked, a large number of documents, orders, and weapons related to the case were seized. These included Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten letter of appointment to the traitor Jiang Pengfei, correspondence between Jiang Pengfei and Chiang Kai-shek and Du Yuming, Jiang's documents for incorporating enemy and puppet troops, and the plan for the premeditated riot and attack on Harbin and orders for mobilizing bandit troops. There were also maps, official seals, symbols, armbands, tokens, command arrows, dragon flags, talismans, handguns, broadswords and other murder weapons. The full text of Jiang Pengfei's proclamation appeasing and recruiting Japanese bandits, issued under the direction of Chiang Kai-shek, is published below:

Proclamation to Japanese Armed Groups:
"The world's affairs are governed by order after chaos and order is brought out of chaos, this is a natural law and a natural trend. Since the 'September 18th Incident,' the European war has followed, one after another, for fourteen years in an instant. The exhaustion of national strength and the suffering of the people have caused those who have suffered from the war to taste the pain. However, people who are tired of chaos and yearn for order, I think people of all countries have expressed sympathy. Until the 'August 15th' war calmed down a bit, the Japanese soldiers in the Northeast were again fiercely attacked by the Soviet army. Except for those who were wounded and captured, the majority avoided disaster in the forests and hid in the mountains. With no country to rely on and no home to return to, who has no parents, who has no wife and children? They are not clothed warmly, not fed fully, have no soup to drink when thirsty, and no medicine when sick, which is very pitiful and also lamentable. Now the central government of our country has incorporated more than 100,000 Japanese armed troops, and the equal treatment is well known to all and is indeed true. This army commander has been ordered by the National Government to lead troops to various locations in the Northeast to reorganize the existing troops so that they do not scatter, and to call on Japanese armed comrades to not wander. Currently, those who have been recruited and incorporated by this army include more than 30,000 people in Harbin, Acheng, Pingshan and other places. Now Major General Lü Haiting, commander of the 98th Division of this army, is also responsible for recruiting Japanese armed comrades. I hope that all Japanese armed groups will quickly wake up, no longer stubborn, to avoid the suffering of the cold and starvation in the mountains. Good words are warm in winter, I hope you will understand. Jiang Pengfei, Commander of the Newly Compiled 27th Army of the Army, August 1, 35th year of the Republic of China."

　　蒋介石祸国殃民又一铁证
    姜逆召抚日寇文告
    【新华社哈尔滨十四日电】哈市阴谋暴动案破获时，曾缴获大批与该案有关之文件命令及暴动武器，其中包括蒋介石亲笔写给姜逆鹏飞的委任状、姜逆与蒋介石杜聿明来往函件、姜逆收编敌伪军之文件及此次预谋暴动进攻哈市计划与调动匪军命令，此外尚有地图、关防符号、臂章、令符、令箭、龙旗、符咒、手枪、大刀等凶器。兹先将姜逆鹏飞在蒋介石指使下所发颁之召抚日寇文件全文发表于后：召抚日军武装团体同志文：“世界大势由治人乱由乱人治，必然之理自然之势，查‘九一八’以来，欧战接踵复起，转瞬之间十有四年，国力之消耗人民之涂炭，受战祸者饱尝痛苦。然厌乱思治，想各国人士未有不表同情者。迄到‘八一五’战争稍静，而东北日本战士又遭苏联军猛击，除伤亡被生俘者外，多数避祸森林，匿居山岳，无国可依无家可归，孰无父母，谁无妻子，穿不蔽体，食不得饱，渴无汤水，病无医药，殊为可怜，又复可悯。现在我国中央政府收编日本武装数在十万人以上，待遇平等，人所共知，事属确实。本军长受命国府，带军先到东北各地点编旧有各部队使勿漫散，并召抚日本武装同志勿使流离，现经本军召抚编收者如哈尔滨、阿城、平山等处已有三万余人。今派本军第九十八师师长吕海廷少将兼负召抚日本武装同志责任，希各日本武装团体速为醒悟，勿再执拗，免居森山之苦冻饿之忧，良言冬暖，希明察焉。陆军新编第二十七军军长姜鹏飞、中华民国三十五年八月一日。
