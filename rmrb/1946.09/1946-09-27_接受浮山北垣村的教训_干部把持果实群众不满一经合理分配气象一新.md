Accepting the Lessons of Beiyuan Village, Fushan
Cadres Seized Fruits of Labor, Arousing Popular Discontent - Fair Distribution Brings a Fresh Start

[Our newspaper Yangcheng 22nd dispatch] Since the mobilization of the masses in Beiyuan Village, Fushan in February, the grain, livestock, and land seized from local tyrants and evil gentry have all been controlled by village cadres, leading to extremely low morale among the masses. In April, during the lean season, some villagers asked the cadres to borrow some grain, but the cadres refused, only to turn around and lend it to wealthy people for production. Others asked the cadres to borrow livestock for plowing, but the cadres said they were too busy with the livestock, yet they readily used them to haul coal and grind grain for themselves. They even preferred to leave the livestock idle rather than help the families of soldiers deliver manure. As a result, some land was left uncultivated, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. Li Facai, who sold tofu, said: "Other people are getting richer and richer after the liberation, but we are getting poorer. Last year, before the movement, I could make a living selling tofu; now, after half a year of meetings and struggle sessions, I've only received two dou of grain. What am I working for?" Li Xiben, who peddled coal, said: "After half a year of struggle sessions, we have even less to eat and drink; only the cadres are getting things!" Later, after an inspection by the district, this phenomenon was discovered. The village cadres were immediately persuaded to hand over all the gains, which were then distributed through mass discussion. In the process of distributing the gains, the masses criticized the cadres, and a work review was conducted from the bottom up, resulting in the re-election of some cadres. Since then, the village has taken on a completely new look, and the cadres and masses are unprecedentedly united. The number of peasant association members has increased to more than 180.

　　接受浮山北垣村的教训
　　干部把持果实群众不满  一经合理分配气象一新
    【本报阳城二十二日电】浮山北垣村自二月发动群众以来，先后清算豪绅恶霸所得粮食、牲口、土地，均为村干部把持，致群众情绪异常低落。四月间青黄不接，曾有群众向干部商借一些粮食，干部不肯，转脸却借给有钱人去搞生产。又有人向干部借牲口犁地，干部说，牲口没工夫；转脸却给自己驮煤、架磨。甚至宁可叫牲口闲着，也不肯替抗属送粪。部分土地也因而荒芜，群众对此异常不满。卖豆腐的李发财说：“人家翻身越翻越富，咱越翻翻穷。去年不运动时，咱卖豆腐还能顾住嘴；现今每天开会，斗了半年，只分了二斗粮食，你说咱为个啥？”贩煤的李喜本说：“开斗争会斗了半年，越没吃喝，光是干部得东西！”后经区上检查，发现此种现象，当即说服村干部把全部果实交出，由群众讨论分配，并在分配果实中，由群众对干部提出批评，自下而上进行工作检查，改选部分干部。自此该村气象一新，干部群众空前团结，农会会员发展到一百八十余人。
