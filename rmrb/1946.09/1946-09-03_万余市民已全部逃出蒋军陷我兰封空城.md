[This report from our correspondent on the Longhai Front on the 29th] Lanfeng City was once again captured by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the 22nd. To avoid being ravaged and destroyed by Chiang's troops, all of the city's ten thousand-plus residents buried and moved all of their grain and supplies, and fled with their elders and children to the liberated areas outside the city. After Chiang's troops entered Lanfeng, the entire city was deserted. Chiang's troops complained bitterly in the city, exclaiming, "Everyone has run away, and the army can't get food. What should we do?" Our government has now taken responsibility for providing food and clothing to the refugees and distributing them to safe areas in the liberated zones. The people of Lanfeng's guerrilla warfare is rapidly developing.
[This report from our correspondent in Handan on the 28th] The Kuomintang troops invading our eastern Henan northern area are continuing to increase their troops and expand their offensive. On the 19th, the 421st Regiment of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division (formerly the 32nd Army) of Chiang's troops stationed in the Wuzhi, Xiuwu, and Huojia area was transferred east to Xinxiang. On the 22nd, two regiments of the 23rd Brigade of the 85th Division (formerly the 23rd Division of the 85th Army) were transferred east from Qi County to reinforce Chiang's troops attacking Hua County and Jun County. On the 25th, the 312th Regiment of the 104th Brigade (formerly the 104th Division) of the Kuomintang stationed in Zhengzhou also entered the area east of Wuzhi in northern Henan as a mobile force for the Kuomintang's offensive. Simultaneously with the reinforcements, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are launching larger-scale offensives on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. On the 23rd, a regiment of the puppet Sun Dianying from Tangyin occupied our Wuling Town (fifty miles southeast of Tangyin). On the same day, more than 3,000 people from the 40th Division (formerly the 40th Army) stationed in Anyang launched a three-pronged offensive against Qugou, an important town in Anyang, and are now threatening to invade our Shuiye. On the 24th, more than 400 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops north of Anyang City simultaneously invaded our Guo Wangdu. On the 26th, two companies of the Kuomintang "National Protection Corps" from Anyang also launched a sudden attack on the area north of Guo Wangdu. The invading forces are now being powerfully counterattacked by the local self-defense soldiers and civilians.
