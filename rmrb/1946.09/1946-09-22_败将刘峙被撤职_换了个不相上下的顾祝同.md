Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: The Nationalist Party's Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters Director, Liu Zhi, and his Chief of Staff, Zhao Zili, have been dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek due to the disastrous defeat in the civil war along the Longhai Railway. On the Longhai Railway, six brigades (originally divisions) of Chiang's troops were annihilated by the military and civilians of the liberated areas. Zhao Xitian, the commander of the Third Division (formerly the commander of the Tenth Army), was captured. Gu Zhutong, the successor to Liu Zhi and the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Defense Ministry's Army, has arrived in Zhengzhou and established the so-called Zhengzhou Forward Command Post. According to those familiar with the inside workings of Chiang's army, Gu Zhutong and Liu Zhi are equally incompetent "brothers in misfortune." He proved to be a clumsy commander during the eighteen years of war. Prior to this, Chiang Kai-shek had dismissed the commander of the southern front for the offensive against Northern Jiangsu, the Commander-in-Chief of the 32nd Group Army.

　　败将刘峙被撤职
    换了个不相上下的顾祝同
    【新华社延安十九日电】国民党郑州绥署主任刘峙及其参谋长赵子立，因指挥陇海线内战遭受惨败，已被蒋介石撤职。在陇海线，蒋军曾先后有六个旅（原师）被解放区军民歼灭，其第三师师长（原第十军军长）赵锡田被俘。刘峙之继任者国民党国防部陆军总司令顾祝同已于日前到郑州成立所谓郑州前进指挥所。据熟悉蒋军内幕者称：顾祝同与刘峙是不相上下的难兄难弟，他在十八年战争中，证明是一个拙劣的指挥官。在此以前，蒋介石曾撤消了进攻苏北的南线指挥官三十二集团军总司令。
