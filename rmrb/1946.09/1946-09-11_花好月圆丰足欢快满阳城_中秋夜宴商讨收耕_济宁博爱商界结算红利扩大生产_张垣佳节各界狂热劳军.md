    【This newspaper Yangcheng, 8th dispatch】 The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and Yangcheng has become a bustling city. There are over a hundred mooncake shops in the city, and fruit stalls fill the streets, with yellow pears and red dates in a colorful display. Each mooncake shop sets up a square table in front of its store, displaying a pile of mooncakes and a pot of fresh flowers, symbolizing flowers blooming and the moon being full, and the abundant and joyful scene of the liberated area permeates the entire city. Merchants from Gaoping, Fushan, Jishi, Shimin, and other counties come here in a continuous stream to purchase festival goods. Although the mooncake shops are working day and night, they still feel that the supply cannot meet the demand. The Zhou Fenglin mutual aid group in Shangqin Village of this county, which is composed of six poor peasant families and four emerging middle peasant families, slaughtered a pig. Each family bought three jin of mooncakes, planning to invite village cadres to a celebration on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and to discuss the autumn harvest and autumn plowing work. Zhou Fenglin said, "This is a good life that has never been seen before. This is all given to us by Chairman Mao. We must thank him properly."
    【This newspaper Handan, 8th dispatch】 During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the industrial and commercial circles of the border region are enthusiastically settling accounts and distributing profits in order to expand production and market transactions. The transaction volume of several major commodities in Jining City, such as native cloth, grain, leather goods, groceries, and oil, has increased extremely significantly. In the past six months, the transaction volume of native cloth was 269,000 pi, which is double that of the same period last year; the transaction volume of leather goods was 713,000 pieces, which is a four-fold increase compared to the same period last year; the transaction volume of livestock was 22,900 heads, which is a one-and-a-half-fold increase compared to the same period last year; the transaction volume of vegetable oil was 899,000 jin, which is a one-third increase compared to the same period last year. Various shops are making three times their usual profit, and the owners are all beaming with joy. For example, the Bo'ai People's Coal Factory was established in November last year, and merchants and residents from all over the countryside enthusiastically invested, quickly raising 4,425 shares, totaling 1.54 million yuan. It started business at the end of November last year, and by the end of December, it had already made a profit of 1.4 million yuan. In January of this year, it increased to 9,804 shares, with a share capital of 3.1 million yuan, and has so far made a profit of 14 million yuan.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 8th dispatch】 Zhangyuan and Xuanhua cities are enthusiastically launching a Mid-Autumn Festival campaign to support the troops. Companies and businesses are posting colorful advertisements for goods sold at cost for troop support. Citizens are actively discussing gifts for慰劳, and government agencies, factories, and schools are enthusiastically rushing to sew tens of thousands of comfort bags, preparing to send them to the front lines before the Mid-Autumn Festival. All the employees of the Border Region Bank have made more than 3,000 comfort bags filled with rich mooncakes and daily necessities. Cheng Zhi, a female employee of the issuance department, used her exquisite craftsmanship to sew more than 300 bags by herself. All the workers and craftsmen of the Xinhua Machinery Factory put a handwritten or entrusted letter in each bag. Hu Shuzhen, the wife of a sand-turning craftsman, wrote in her letter: "The towel in the bag is for you to wipe off the dirt, the万金油 is to refresh you. We cannot personally go to sew your clothes if they are torn, so we have put a few needles and a bundle of thread. I wish you a speedy victory over Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." On the 6th, the merchants and residents of Zhang City initially raised more than 4,722,000 yuan worth of troop support gifts. Zhuang Heqing of the West District donated his treasured special phonograph and a large number of records, which he had collected for more than 20 years, to the soldiers for battlefield entertainment. The Xuanhua City Federation of Trade Unions has received troop support donations from workers in various factories, totaling more than 6 million yuan. Li Wangui, an old worker at the telephone bureau, is willing to give up smoking and drinking, save money, and donate 10,000 yuan. Two female employees of the Xuanhua Machinery Factory, in addition to donating a large amount of their wages, also set aside time every day to produce, donating all the proceeds to the front lines. Liu Ren [symbol not recognized], Director of the Industry and Commerce Department of the Chahar Provincial Government, after donating 5 million yuan, recently donated another 5 million yuan to慰劳 the soldiers at the front.
