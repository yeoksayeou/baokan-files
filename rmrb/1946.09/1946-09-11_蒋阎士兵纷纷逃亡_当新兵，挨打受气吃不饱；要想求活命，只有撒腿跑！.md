　　Jiang and Yan Soldiers Flee in Droves
    “Being a new recruit means being beaten, abused, and starved; if you want to survive, the only way is to run!”
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi Ninth Dispatch] Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, our army conducted peaceful appeals to the Yan army on the front lines of the civil war, urging them to withdraw from the civil war and return home for family reunions. Yan soldiers from Qixian City and Zihong Town in the county deserted and defected to our liberated area. On the 5th, eight Yan soldiers from Zihong, including Du Yangchang, surrendered to us. In the afternoon, six unarmed soldiers who had escaped from the city also arrived, looking haggard and dressed in rags. Our government has, according to their requests, separately escorted them back to their homes. An entire platoon of Yan soldiers stationed at Qixian City Railway Station has deserted in the past five days, leaving only the platoon leader. Another report: Yan stubbornly implemented so-called "soldier-peasant integration" in villages within a five-mile radius of Qixian City, forcibly conscripting more than 400 young men. The conscripted young men, unwilling to participate in the civil war, jumped off the train and fled in all directions on the way to the southwestern Shanxi front line.
    [Xinhua News Agency Zhangjiakou Eighth Dispatch] "Being a new recruit means being beaten, abused, and starved. If you want to survive, the only way is to run!" This is the voice circulating among Jiang's soldiers along the Pinghan Railway. According to Lin Ruihai and three other soldiers from the Second Company of Gao Dingfu's regiment of Jiang's Security Corps who escaped to the liberated area, "The shortage of deserters in Lao Jiang's troops can never be filled. The newly conscripted men are unwilling to be wronged ghosts in the civil war. The officers of the First and Second Battalions of our Security Corps are afraid that the new recruits will run away, so they order them to go to the toilet collectively. This has led to even more desertions. Last month, sixty-two brothers deserted from our company in one week. The Second Regiment of the Ninety-fourth Division, an 'old brand' Central Army stationed in Ge Li after running from Changxindian, also had many deserters. It is said that one hundred and thirteen of them slipped away along the way, scaring the officers into ordering the new recruits not to stand guard or escort laborers, and sometimes even taking away all their rifles and uniforms, leaving them only in their underwear. But the new recruits still run away even with their bare chests."

　　蒋阎士兵纷纷逃亡
    “当新兵，挨打受气吃不饱；要想求活命，只有撒腿跑！”
    【本报长治九日电】中秋节前，我军曾向内战前线之阎军进行和平喊话，劝说彼等退出内战回家骨肉团圆。祁县城及该县子洪镇之阎军士兵纷纷罢战投奔我解放区，五日有子洪阎军士兵杜央昌等八名，向我投诚。下午又由城内逃来之徒手士兵六名，形容枯槁，衣服褴褛，我政府已按彼等要求，分别护送其回家。祁县城车站所驻之阎军一个排，在最近五天内，全部逃亡，只剩排长一人。另讯：阎顽近在祁县城外五里周围村庄实行所谓“兵农合一”，强抓青壮年四百余，被抓青壮年不愿内战，在开往晋西南前线途中，纷纷跳下火车，四散逃亡。
    【新华社张家口八日电】“当新兵，挨打受气吃不饱。要想求活命，只有撒腿跑！”这是平汉沿线蒋军士兵流传的声音。据蒋军保安团高定福部第二中队逃来解放区的士兵林瑞海等四人称：“老蒋部队里逃兵的缺额是永远补充不起来的，新抓来的壮丁，都不愿当内战屈死鬼。俺们保安团第一、第二大队官长们怕新兵们逃跑，大小便都是命令集体来、集体去。这一下子，逃跑的更多了。上个月俺们队里一个礼拜就跑了六十二个弟兄，从长辛店跑来驻在圪里的“老牌”中央军九十四师二团跑的也不少。听说一路上就溜了一百十三个，吓的长官们命令新兵不站岗、不押夫子，有时候把步枪军装全给收了，单只穿裤叉。可是新兵们光着赤膊还是要跑。”
