　　Workers of Fujiatan Before and After Liberation
　　Lu Sheng
    Fifteen li north from the South Gate Railway Station, the modernized coal mine, the Northwest Industrial Corporation’s Fujiatan Third Factory, comes into view. Between the two mountains, over six hundred meters apart, there are over three hundred meters of flat land, divided into two sections by the Fen River. On the north bank are the factory buildings, the electric company, and the train station; on the south bank are the barracks and the dormitories of the factory director, section chiefs, and Japanese employees retained by Yan Xishan. The buildings are all neat and magnificent. On both sides of the mountains, besides the chimney of the electric company and the pillboxes used to suppress the workers, there are countless earthen cave dwellings like beehives. Every cave entrance is filled with suffocating coal gas. The thousand-odd workers of Fujiatan live in these earthen caves, where they never see the sun all day long. In the morning, the workers are forced by the mine police to crawl into the dark coal pits before dawn, and they cannot return to their earthen caves until midnight. The factory’s toilets have electric lights, but the workers can only light dim sesame oil lamps the size of beans and crawl in the dark caves. For two months, Yan Xishan has not paid the workers’ wages, but he forces each worker to dig 1,000 jin of coal every day. Yuan Tinggui, a worker in his fifties, has been working in the factory for more than five years. He has never bought a single zhang of cloth to make clothes, nor has he worn a new pair of shoes. For five years, he has been picking up other people’s worn-out shoes from the factory to wear. Now he is very old, and he cannot dig 1,000 jin every day, so he has to ask his seven-year-old child to go down into the mine as well. Even then, they can only cook a bowl of black beans to eat each day, and his wife has also starved to death. Once, he was late to the mine, and the mine police beat and cursed him, “Damn it, you still dig too little! The steel mills in Taiyuan rely on this coal! The trains on the Datong-Puzhou Railway also rely on this coal!” When the worker Niu Xiaocheng led me to the workers’ dormitory, we went halfway up the mountain and passed two collapsed cave dwellings, overgrown with wormwood and weeds. He stood there blankly, two tears rolling down his eyes, and said, “Eleven workers died in these two cave dwellings!” This happened in the autumn of the year before last. The cave dwellings were old, and the factory did not repair them. After three days of continuous rain, more than a dozen cave dwellings collapsed. More than a hundred people died that time, including several fellow villagers who had come out with him. At this moment, someone interrupted, saying, “The place where we live is simply a graveyard! Look at these dozen or so collapsed caves, all buried with the corpses of our workers!” I turned around and saw that the speaker’s face was covered with black scars the size of copper coins, and his eyes and lips were also cracked, and there were rings of scars on his hands. He was clearly burned. I immediately asked him what happened. He said, “Comrade, it’s really sad to talk about it! It was blasting coal. I loaded four detonator tubes in the mine, using yellow explosives. Unfortunately, only three exploded, and the other one didn’t go off after waiting for a long time. The mine police foreman was impatient and forced me to go in and check. Before I even got close, the explosive went off, Comrade…” He touched the scars on his face and showed me, “Luckily, I didn’t die!” No one knows how many workers have died here from blasting coal. We passed a pillbox, and next to the pillbox was a piece of land where the corn grew particularly well. When the worker Peng Hesheng saw the corn, he said angrily, “Look how well this corn is growing! But it’s grown with the blood and flesh of our workers!” I was very surprised and asked him why. He said, “Comrade, you’ll be scared if I tell you! There are more than a hundred people buried here just from Jincheng! Last autumn, the weather was hot, and everyone couldn’t get enough to eat, plus they were drinking muddy water from the Fen River, and the workers all got dysentery. Damn Yan Xishan. He didn’t give us any treatment, let alone that, he forced us to produce 1,000 jin a day. As a result, four or five dead people had to be carried out every day. At first, the corpses were thrown on this land and left unattended. Later, the stench blew to the factory, and plus Mr. Shi’s (the factory director sent by Yan Xishan) dog wanted to gnaw on human bones, and he was afraid of making the dog sick, so he ordered the workers to dig trenches to bury them. Later, more and more workers died, and these trenches were dug one after another on this land, burying three or four hundred people on this land alone. There used to be more than a thousand people, but today there are only more than five hundred left!” Everyone became angry when he said this. One worker shouted, “Damn it, Yan Xishan doesn’t treat us like human beings!” Another also shouted, “Arrest Director Shi, let’s all go and settle accounts with him!” On the first day, the Taiyue Administrative Office allocated 300 shi of relief grain from Huo County and Lingshi to solve the workers’ current food problem. During the distribution, I learned about the origins of these five hundred-odd workers. Some were captured from the Liberated Areas by the Japanese invaders, collaborators, and Yan Xishan’s army, and some were peasants from Yan’s puppet-controlled areas who had fled to escape Yan Xishan’s “soldier-peasant integration.” Therefore, some of them knew that the people in the Liberated Areas had already turned themselves around under the leadership of the Communist Party, and they also knew that the Eighth Route Army would never forget to rescue them. Therefore, when the sound of our army liberating Fujiatan sounded, the workers automatically stopped working and prepared to welcome us. The workers of the electric company, in order to facilitate our army’s capture of the pillboxes, automatically closed the power gate on the barbed wire as soon as they heard the cannon fire. After the pillbox on the south side was captured by our army, the Yan puppet troops in Fujiatan fled in a panic. When the Eighth Route Army entered the Fujiatan coal mine, the worker Zhu Hongyuan held the hand of soldier Li Quangui tightly and said, “Comrade, we’ve finally waited for you!” He was so excited that tears flowed from his eyes. Many workers reached out their hands to shake hands with our comrades and said, “We’ve been looking forward to you for a long time!” The workers of the electric company led the soldiers to visit the machines, saying that the machines they had protected had not been damaged at all. At night, the electric lights seemed brighter than usual! In a friendly conversation like old friends, a scout mentioned that before the attack, he had been sent to scout whether the barbed wire was electrified. He went without any necessary equipment. He climbed to the wire and had to press his finger on the wire. He felt nothing and went back to report. Everyone laughed. One worker said, “If there was electricity, you would have been sucked in and burned to death one meter away from the wire! The scout laughed and said, “If you hadn’t cooperated so well, I wouldn’t have been able to see you today!” Now, the workers’ mood is very different from before liberation. They said, “Now we are working for ourselves!” When I talked to them about how the Chiang-Yan puppet troops still wanted to seize this coal mine, the workers said, “If they come, we can’t live anyway, so we’ll fight them! We have the Eighth Route Army behind us, so we’re not afraid of anything!” They are now working hard to increase production to support the front line and have begun to organize self-defense.

　　富家滩工人解放前后
　　鲁生
    由南关车站沿着铁路往北走十五里，一个近代化的煤矿厂，西北实业公司富家滩第三厂便映入眼帘里，在六百多米两山之间，有三百多米平地，被汾河水分成两块。北岸是厂房、电灯公司和车站，南岸是营盘和厂长、股长和阎锡山挽留下的日本职员们的宿舍，建筑均整齐而华美。在两面山上，除过电灯公司矗立的烟筒和镇压工人的碉堡外，还有蜂窝似的数不清的土窑洞，每个洞口，都弥漫着使人窒息的煤气炭气，这就是富家滩千余工人的住处。土窑中每日两头不见太阳。工人们早上不明就被矿警队逼着钻进漆黑的煤窑底，直到夜半才能回到土窑。厂房的厕所能设电灯，但工人们却只能点豆粒大的昏暗的麻油灯，在黑魆魆的窑洞里爬行。两个月了，阎锡山没有给工人发过工资，但却逼着每个工人每天要挖一千斤煤。工人袁亭贵五十多岁了，在厂里干了五年多，从来没有扯过一丈布缝件衣服，也没有穿过一双新鞋。五年来，一直是去厂房拾人家的烂鞋穿。现在他很衰老了，每天挖不够一千斤，不得不叫自己七岁的孩子也下窑去。就这，每天也只能煮的吃碗黑豆，老婆也饿死了。一次他去矿井迟了，矿警队边打边骂：“妈的，你挖少了还行！太原的炼钢厂凭着这煤！同蒲路的火车也凭着这煤”！工人牛小成引我到工人的宿舍去时上到半山腰，经过两个塌毁的窑洞，上面长满了黄蒿和野草。他走到那里呆呆的站住了，眼睛滚出两颗泪珠来，说：“这两个窑洞里死了我们十一个工人呀！”这是前年秋天的事。窑洞年代久了，厂方不给修理，一连下了三天雨，窑洞塌了十几孔。那一次一共死了一百多人，里面还有他相跟出来的几个老乡。这时后边有人插嘴说：“我们住的地方简直是坟墓！你看这塌了的十几孔窑里，都埋着我们工人的尸首！”我转回头一看，那说话的人满脸是铜元大的黑疤，眼圈和嘴唇上也裂开了，手上更是一圈一圈的疤印。这分明是被火烧了的。我马上问他这是怎么回事，他说：“同志，提起来真伤心呀！炸煤哩，在窑里装好四个爆发管，用的黄色炸药。不凑巧，只响了三个，还有一个等了好一会不响。矿警工头都不耐烦，逼着叫我进去看。咱还没走到跟前，炸药响了，同志…………”他摸着脸上的伤疤给我看：“好在没死了！”这儿因为炸煤死了的工人，不知有多少，我们经过一个碉堡，堡旁有一块地，玉茭长的特别好。工人彭和生一看到玉茭，便气愤愤的说：“看这一块玉茭长得多好！可是它是吃我们工人的血肉长成的！”我很奇怪，问他为什么，他说：“同志，提起来你要害怕哩！这里光咱晋城人就埋着一百多！去年秋天天气热，大家又吃不上饭，再加上喝汾河的浑水，工人都害了痢疾；日他娘的阎锡山。不给治病不用说，逼着我们一天要出一千斤，结果是每天要往外抬四五个死人。起初是把死尸扔到这地里就不管了，后来臭气吹到厂房了，再加上石先生（阎锡山派的厂长）的狗要啃死人骨头，他怕把狗吃坏了，才叫工人挖壕去埋葬。以后工人越死越多，这地里便一壕一壕的挨着埋过去，光这地里就埋有三四百人。以前一千多人，今天只剩五百多人了！”他讲到这里，大家都气愤起来。一个工人高叫：“日他娘，阎锡山就不把我们当人！”另一个也喊着：“捉住石厂长，我们大家去和他算总账！”第一天，太岳行署为解决工人当前的吃饭问题，先在霍县灵石拨来三百石救济粮。在分配中间，我了解了这五百多工人的来历。一部分是过去日寇汉奸阎锡山军队到解放区抓来的，一部分是阎伪统治区的老百姓为躲避阎锡山的“兵农合一”逃来的。因此他们中间有些知道解放区的老百姓已在共产党领导下翻了身，也知道八路军绝对不会忘记来拯救他们。所以当我军解放富家滩的炮声响起时，工人们都自动停了工准备欢迎。电灯公司的工人们，为便利我军攻占碉堡，一听炮响就自动将铁丝网上的电门关闭了，南面的碉堡被我军攻下后，富家滩的阎伪军慌忙逃跑了，八路军进入富家滩煤厂，工人朱宏元两手紧握住战士李全贵的手说：“同志，总算等着你们了！”他兴奋得流出了眼泪，许多工人都伸着手来向我们同志握手说：“早就盼望你们呀！”电灯公司的工人们引着战士参观着机器，叙说自己保护的机器一点也没被破坏。夜间，电灯比往常更显得亮了！在老朋友一样亲密的谈话中，一个侦察员谈到他在进攻前，曾被派去侦察铁丝网上有无通电。他没带什么必要的器具便去了。他爬到网前，不得不用手指在铁丝上按，觉得没有什么，便回去报告。大家听着都哄笑起来。一个工人说：“如果有电，离铁丝一米远就能吸住烧死！侦察员笑说：“要不是你们配合得好，我今天就见不上你们了！”现在，工人们的情绪与解放前已经大不相同了。他们说：“现在才是为自己工作哩！”当我和他们谈到蒋阎伪军还想来抢夺这座煤矿时，工人们说：“他们来了，咱们反正不能活，咱就和他拚！咱背后有八路军，什么也不怕！”他们现正以努力增产来支援前线，并开始组织自卫。
