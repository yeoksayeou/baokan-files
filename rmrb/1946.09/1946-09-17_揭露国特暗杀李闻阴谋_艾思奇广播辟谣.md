Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th. Last night, philosopher Ai Siqi broadcast on Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station, exposing the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracy to assassinate Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. He pointed out that Kuomintang secret agents spread rumors saying, "Li Gongpu was killed by Ai Siqi," which only proves that the Kuomintang authorities themselves are "thieves crying 'stop thief!'" No one would believe that Ai Siqi, who lives in Yan'an, would have such magic to kill Li Gongpu, who was thousands of miles away. The real thieves, the real murderers who killed Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, are none other than the Kuomintang's highest authorities and their secret service agencies under their command. He said: The Kuomintang authorities dare not accept the request of Liang Shuming of the Democratic League and the American newspaper *Continental Daily* in Shanghai to transfer this major case to Nanjing and Shanghai for public trial, which is a sign of "a guilty conscience." He especially mentioned Gu Zhutong's remarks when he represented the Kuomintang's highest authorities to handle the Li-Wen case in Kunming. These remarks completely repeated the murderer Li Wenshan's slander against Wen Yiduo in court at the time, falsely accusing Mr. Wen's remarks demanding democracy and peace as "insulting the government and slandering soldiers." This proves that Gu Zhutong "completely hates the deceased and is completely on the same side as the murderer." Ai Siqi said: "Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo are democrat figures recognized by all of China and even the world. Only the fascist reactionaries who hate peace and hate democracy must put them to death." Ai Siqi pointed out that the Kuomintang authorities' assassination of Li and Wen was aimed at suppressing the people's demands for peace and democracy "in order to smoothly carry out the plan to expand the civil war."

　　揭露国特暗杀李闻阴谋
    艾思奇广播辟谣
    【新华社延安十三日电】昨夜哲学家艾思奇在延安新华广播电台播讲，揭露国民党当局阴谋暗杀李公朴、闻一多，他指出国民党特务造谣说：“李公朴是艾思奇杀死的”，这只能证明国民党当局自己“做贼喊贼”。谁也不会相信住在延安的艾思奇会有这种奇术，能把远在万里之外的李公朴杀死。真正的贼，真正杀死李公朴、闻一多两先生的凶手，不是别人，就是国民党最高当局和它们所指挥的特务机关。他说：国民党当局不敢接受民盟梁漱溟及上海的美国报纸大陆报的要求，拒绝把这一个重大的案件移到京沪来公审，这是“做贼心虚”。他特别提到代表国民党最高当局到昆明去处理李、闻案的顾祝同的谈话，这谈话完全重复了凶手李文山当时在法庭上对闻一多的诬蔑，把闻先生要求民主和平的言论诬作“辱骂政府诋毁军人”，这证明顾祝同“对于死者完全的仇视，而对于凶手完全一鼻孔出气”。艾思奇称：“李公朴、闻一多是全中国公认以至世界公认的民主人士，只有仇视和平仇视民主的法西斯反动派，才一定要把他们置之死地。”艾思奇指出国民党当局之暗杀李、闻，其目的正在于镇压人民的和平民主要求，“以便顺利地进行扩大内战的计划”。
