　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After helping the masses with the wheat harvest, the Democratic Nation-Building Army began its summer political rectification on July 1st. During the rectification, social education was carried out to enlighten the political consciousness of the soldiers. In discussion meetings, they painfully recounted their past sufferings, how they were conscripted into the army, and how they were mistreated after joining. Many soldiers shed tears during their grievances.

　　After in-depth grievance sessions, democratic meetings were held in each regiment. Soldiers actively spoke, raising many opinions about leaders at all levels. After the meetings, democratic systems were formulated through discussion, such as class review meetings, soldiers' congresses, economic committees, the abolition of beatings and scolding, and methods for obeying leadership. As a result, problems in the troops decreased and the morale of the soldiers improved. In order to consolidate the achievements, the headquarters specially issued an order on the 8th of this month to the entire army to continue political rectification until October 30th – the anniversary of the Handan Uprising. Commander Gao called on everyone to commemorate the first anniversary of the Handan Uprising with practical progress in the troops, urging all officers and soldiers to carry forward a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, earnestly carry out rectification, overcome all difficulties, prevent possible deviations, and strive for the victory of political rectification.

　　高总司令号召以实际进步纪念起义
    民主建国军政治整训
    战士沉痛追诉往昔生活
    【本报特讯】民主建国军在帮助群众麦收后，于七月一号开始了暑期政治整训，在整训中进行了社会教育，启发了士兵的政治觉悟。在讨论会上他们沉痛的诉说着自己过去的痛苦，如何被抓去当兵，当兵后又如何受虐待。在诉苦中不少士兵都流出眼泪。
    经过深入的诉苦之后，各团召开了民主大会，士兵踊跃的发言，对各级领导人提出了许多意见，会后经大家讨论订出了一些民主制度，如班检讨会，军人大会，经济委员会，废除打骂和服从领导的办法等，这样一来，部队的问题减少了，士兵的情绪提高了。为了巩固成绩，总部特于本月八日训令全军继续政治整训至十月三十号——邯郸起义纪念日，高总司令更号召大家，以部队实际进步来纪念邯郸起义第一周年，要求全军官兵，发扬高度的革命热忱，认真进行整训，克服一切困难，防止可能发生的偏向，为争取政治整训的胜利而努力。（恩）
