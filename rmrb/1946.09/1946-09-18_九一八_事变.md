On the eve of the September 18th Incident, the Chinese national crisis was already extremely severe. Japanese invaders had been coveting the Northeast and repeatedly provoking incidents. Chiang Kai-shek, preoccupied with "suppressing the Communists" in a civil war, created an opportunity for the Japanese invaders to launch a military invasion. On July 2, 1931, the Japanese Consul in Changchun incited Koreans to forcibly excavate Chinese farmers' fields at Wanbaoshan, which led to opposition from Chinese farmers repairing dikes. A clash with Japanese guards resulted in numerous casualties. On the 5th, Japanese invaders instigated anti-Chinese movements in various parts of Korea, destroying shops and homes of overseas Chinese in Pyongyang, Seoul, and other places, looting their property, and massacring thousands of overseas Chinese. By September 6, the Japanese invaders fabricated the Nakamura disappearance incident as a pretext to threaten China. Japanese troops in Jilin and Liaoning were digging trenches and preparing for war, creating a tense situation. Chiang Kai-shek, however, issued an order to the Northeast Defense Forces: "In the event of Japanese troops provoking incidents, extreme caution must be taken to avoid conflict." As a result, the Japanese invaders began military action on the night of September 18, attacking Shenyang.

That night, the Japanese army divided into two routes under the command of Shigeru Honjo, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. One route attacked Beidaying, first bombarding the garrison with artillery, causing hundreds of casualties. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Nanjing, requesting instructions. Chiang Kai-shek instructed: "No conflict is allowed." He claimed: "This action by the Japanese army is merely a routine provocation. To avoid escalating the incident, an absolute policy of non-resistance must be adopted." Consequently, the Japanese army smoothly occupied Beidaying. The other route of the Japanese army advanced into Shenyang city. The military police in the city, also following Chiang's order of absolute non-resistance, allowed the Japanese army to disarm them. By the morning of the 19th, the entire city of Shenyang was occupied by the Japanese army. All military, government, and civilian institutions, as well as the nation's largest Shenyang Arsenal, artillery factory, and two hundred aircraft, completely fell into the hands of the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, the Japanese invaders divided their forces to attack Andong, Benxi, Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Changchun, and other places. Under the humiliating policy of the Kuomintang authorities, the garrison troops were ordered not to resist and allowed the Japanese invaders to occupy them. On the 21st, the Japanese invaders occupied Jilin, pressed south towards Jinzhou, and dispatched the navy to occupy Qinhuangdao. Soon after, they attacked Heilongjiang and occupied Qiqihar on November 19th. In less than two months, the fertile territory of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, totaling two million square kilometers, more than thirty million people, over four thousand kilometers of railways, and endless resource treasures, were completely lost under the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance.

After the incident, the Kuomintang government persisted in its policy of non-resistance and blindly trusted the "League of Nations" controlled by imperialists. On September 23, it issued a letter to the nation, stating: "Now that the government has brought this case to the Council of the League of Nations, awaiting a resolution based on justice, it hopes that the national army will avoid conflict with the Japanese army." In November, the Chinese Kuomintang government further instructed Shi Zhaoji to propose to the League of Nations the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou, meaning they recognized that the three northeastern provinces east of Jinzhou were to be occupied by the Japanese army, and the Chinese army would withdraw entirely into Shanhaiguan. From then on, the three northeastern provinces fell under enemy and puppet rule for fourteen years.

The Japanese invaders' aggression and the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous acts aroused immense indignation among the Chinese people. The CCP Central Committee, on September 22, first proposed organizing a mass anti-imperialist movement, mobilizing the masses to struggle and resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism... organizing guerrilla warfare in the Northeast to directly strike Japanese imperialism. On September 24, tens of thousands of students from universities and schools in Shanghai also went on strike to petition. Thirty-five thousand dockworkers simultaneously launched an anti-Japanese general strike. This anti-Japanese movement quickly spread to all parts of the country and all strata of society. The CCP's Northeast Party organizations actively organized various anti-Japanese national salvation groups, established people's armed forces, and widely launched patriotic movements and anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, establishing the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army (the predecessor of today's Northeast Democratic United Army), which persisted for fourteen years until the Northeast was liberated from the iron heels of the Japanese invaders.

After the "September 18th" Incident, Chiang Kai-shek immediately began suppressing the people's anti-Japanese movement. According to statistics, from the students' strike and petition in Shanghai to the students' petition in Taiyuan on December 18, Kuomintang military police in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, and other places massacred and arrested hundreds of patriotic students. Chiang Kai-shek lost the Northeast until after the War of Resistance. In January 1939, he publicly declared at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang that resisting to the end meant restoring the situation before the Lugouqiao Incident, meaning he wanted to seek a compromise with the Japanese invaders on the condition of permanently abandoning the Northeast.

　 “九一八”事变
    新华社
    九一八事变前夜，中国民族危机已极严重，日寇窥伺东北，屡次挑衅。蒋介石因忙于“剿共”内战，遂为日寇的发动军事侵略造成机会。一九三一年七月二日，长春日领事嗾使韩人强掘万宝山中国农民田地，引起修堤中国农民反对，与日警卫突死伤甚众。五日，日寇即鼓动朝鲜各地排华运动，捣毁华侨在平壤、汉城等处的店宅，抢夺华侨财产，惨杀华侨数千人。至九月六日，日寇又伪造中村失踪事件，作对华威胁之借口，吉辽各地日军掘壕备战，形势紧张，蒋介石却通令东北防军：“遇有日军寻衅，务须慎重避免冲突”。于是日寇即在九月十八日晚开始军事行动，进袭沈阳。
    当晚日军共分两路，在日关东军司令本庄繁指挥下，一路进攻北大营，先以大炮轰击驻军、死伤数百。张学良急电南京，请示办法，蒋介石竟指示：“不许冲突”谓：“日军此举，不过寻常寻衅性质，为免事件扩大，绝对抱不抵抗主义”。因此日军遂顺利地占领北大营。另一路日军向沈阳城内推进，城内军警也因接奉蒋令绝对不准抵抗，任由日军缴械。到十九日晨，沈阳全城乃被日军侵占，所有军政民机关和全国最大的沈阳兵工厂、制炮厂、及二百架飞机，完全沦入日寇之手。接着日寇又分兵进攻安东、本溪、营口、牛庄、长春等地，在国民党当局屈辱政策下，驻军奉令不抵抗，任从日寇占领。二十一日，日寇侵占吉林，南迫锦州，并派海军占领秦皇岛，不久又进攻黑龙江，十一月十九日占领齐齐哈尔，总共头尾不到两月，东北辽、吉、黑三省两百万方里的肥沃领土，三千余万人民，四千余公里铁路，无尽的资源宝藏，就在国民党蒋介石的不抵抗政策下，完全断送了。
    事变发生后，国民党政府仍坚持不抵抗政策和盲目信赖帝国主义控制下的“国际联盟”，于九月二十三日，发表告全国国民书说：“现在政府既以此案件诉之国联行政院，以待公理之解决，故希望全国军队对日军避免冲突”。十一月中国国民党政府更训令施肇基向国联提议设锦州中立区，就是说他们承认锦州以东的东北三省，由日军占领，中国军队一律撤入山海关内，从此东北三省就沦于敌伪达十四年之久。
    日寇的侵略与国民党蒋介石的卖国行为，激起全中国人民的无比愤慨，中共中央于九月二十二日，首先提出组织群众的反帝运动，发动群众斗争，反抗日本帝国主义的侵略。……组织东北游击战争，直接给日本帝国主义以打击。九月二十四日，上海数万大中小学生也即罢课请愿，三万五千码头工人，同时举行反日大罢工，这一抗日运动很快的普及全国各地，各阶层；中共东北党的组织，更积极组织各种抗日救国团体，建立人民武装，广泛开展爱国运动与抗日游击战争，建立了东北抗日联军（即今天东北民主联军之前身），且整整坚持了十四年，直到东北从日寇铁蹄下解放出来。
    “九一八”事变后，蒋介石即着手镇压人民抗日运动，据统计仅自上海学生罢课请愿起，至十二月十八日太原学生请愿止，南京、上海、广州、太原等地国民党军警屠杀与逮捕爱国学生即达数百人，蒋介石断送了东北直至抗战以后。一九三九年一月，他在国民党五中全会上还公开声明，抗战到底为恢复芦沟桥以前状态，就是说想要在永远放弃东北的条件下与日寇求得妥协。
