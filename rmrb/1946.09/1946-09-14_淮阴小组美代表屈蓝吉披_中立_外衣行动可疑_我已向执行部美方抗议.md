　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 10th. The suspicious and dramatic actions of Colonel Rugh, the US representative of the Huaiyin Executive Group, in this war of aggression by Chiang Kai-shek's troops against the Su-Wan Liberated Area, have exposed the true face of some US personnel who claim to be "neutral." Since May, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have continuously attacked the New Fourth Army in Su-Wan, but Colonel Rugh has never shown any interest in stopping the war. On July 13, the day Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive began, he left without saying goodbye and secretly fled to Nantong, a base of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Since then, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have successively occupied many places such as Huangqiao, Jiangyan, Qutang, Rugao, Haian, and Tianchang, but the US side has remained silent. It was not until the New Fourth Army counterattacked and won, and recovered Linzi and Dingyan, two towns southeast of Rugao, which had been occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on July 17, on August 22, that the "peace envoy" Rugh, who had been living in seclusion in Nantong, suddenly got inspiration and rushed to Linzi on a small motorboat on August 27 to "mediate." He accused the New Fourth Army of "sabotaging the ceasefire" by recovering Linzi and Dingyan, and twice entered the rear of the New Fourth Army's front line without permission to inspect, and then requested to return to Nantong. Colonel Rugh's ambiguous behavior has aroused widespread suspicion and indignation among the soldiers and civilians on the front lines. In order to protect his safety, the Huaiyin authorities have advised him to return to the rear group headquarters of the New Fourth Army and have reported his activities to the Peiping Executive Headquarters, lodging a serious protest.

　　淮阴小组美代表屈蓝吉披“中立”外衣行动可疑
    我已向执行部美方抗议
    【新华社淮阴十日电】淮阴执行小组美方代表屈蓝吉上校，在此次蒋军向苏皖解放区进攻战争中可疑的戏剧化行动，暴露了某些自称“中立”的美方人员的真面目。蒋军自五月以来，即不断进攻苏皖新四军，但屈氏从未表示过任何制止战争的兴趣，反于七月十三日，即蒋军大规模进攻开始之日，不别而行，私自逃到蒋军根据地的南通。此后蒋军连续攻占黄桥、姜堰、曲塘、如皋、海安、天长等许多地方，美方始终一声不响。及至新四军反击获胜，并于八月二十二日收复蒋军于七月十七日攻占的如皋东南林梓、丁堰两镇后，隐居南通的“和平使者”屈蓝吉突然得到灵感，而于八月二十七日乘小汽艇赶来林梓“调处”，责备新四军收复林梓、丁堰是“破坏停战”，并两次擅入新四军战线后方视察，然后要求仍去南通。屈氏的暖昧行为，引起前线军民普遍的怀疑和愤慨。淮阴当局为保护他的安全，已劝他回到新四军的后方小组所在地，并将他的活动报告北平执行部，提出严重抗议。
