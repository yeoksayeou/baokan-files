Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 23rd: The Jiaodong Liberated Area has achieved remarkable success in transportation construction. The Jiaodong Administrative Office's Transportation Bureau has established bureaus for highways, postal services, telephone, telegraph, and navigation administration, each responsible for their respective areas. Both land and water transportation are extremely convenient. Highways, with Laiyang as the center, reach Changyi and Weixian to the west, Rongcheng to the east, Penglai and Huangxian to the north, and Jimo to the south. In addition to the complete repair of highways such as Yantai-Weixian and Qingdao-Weihai, over 1,300 *li* of new highways have been built. There are a total of 24 trunk and branch lines, totaling over 4,370 *li*. The reconstruction of the Laiyang-Yantai, Laiyang-Pingdu, and Wendeng-Haiyang trunk lines, totaling 750 *li*, will also be carried out. The postal service currently has 351 first, second, and third-class post offices and postal stations, with postal routes extending over 38,700 *li*. There are four main lines: Laiyang-Rongcheng, Laiyang-Huangxian, Laiyang-(County), and Laiyang-Jiao County. The postal stations in the villages are closely connected, and mail to and from Central China, Northeast China, Yan'an, and other places is unimpeded. Before 1945, long-distance telephone lines were only 1,000 *li* long, and were often obstructed by the enemy. Currently, major cities have telephone trunk and main branch lines totaling over 7,000 *li*. Recently, commercial long-distance telephone lines have been constructed between major cities such as Laiyang, Yantai, Weihai, Longkou, and Shidao, which are expected to be completed this winter and next spring. The use of existing telegraph lines for wired telegraphs has also begun.
