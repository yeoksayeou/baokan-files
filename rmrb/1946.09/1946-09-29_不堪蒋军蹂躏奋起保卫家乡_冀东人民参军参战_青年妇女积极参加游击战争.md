Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei Front, 25th—The broad masses of peaceful people in eastern Hebei, who have been devastated by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, have risen up to join the army and participate in the war to defend their homes. In the month since Chiang's troops began their invasion at the end of last month, more than 10,000 militiamen from all over eastern Hebei have spontaneously flooded into the main forces and guerrilla units. More than one hundred young students from four villages in Fengrun indignantly said, "With Chiang Kai-shek here, we can no longer hope to study in peace!" So they united and went to join the Eighth Route Army together. Young women also went in groups to the county and district democratic governments to request enlistment, and when they were tactfully refused, they all went back in tears. Some have already organized "Women's Explosives Teams" and "Youth and Women's Self-Defense Teams" in their villages to actively participate in self-defense guerrilla warfare. In the battle of Qishuzhuang (near Fengrun) on the 5th, more than twenty stretchers participated in front-line rescue work, many of which were organized by young women.

    【新华社冀东前线廿五日电】横遭蒋军蹂躏的冀东广大和平人民，已奋起参军参战，保卫自己家乡。自上月末旬蒋军开始进犯，迄今一个月中，冀东各地自动涌进主力军和游击队的民兵已达万人以上。丰润四乡一百多个青年学生义愤填膺的说：“蒋介石来了，再也不要指望安心读书！”于是他们团结共同去参加八路军。青年妇女亦结队去县区民主政府请求入伍，当被婉言拒绝时，她们都伤心的流着泪回去。有的已在村中自己组织了“妇女爆炸组”“青妇自卫队”积极参加自卫游击战争。在五日，七树庄（丰润附近）歼灭战中，参加火线救护的二十余付担架，其中很多就是由青年妇女组织的。
