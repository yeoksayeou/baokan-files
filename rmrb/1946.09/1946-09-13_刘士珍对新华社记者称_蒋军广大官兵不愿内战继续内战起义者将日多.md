Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 8th: This reporter recently visited Liu Shizhen, the regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the Temporary 15th Division of the 96th Army of Chiang's troops, who laid down their arms with Wen Zu (Zhangqiu South) on the 25th of last month. Mr. Liu lives comfortably and is in good spirits. He said: "We were originally the Second Cavalry Army of He Zhuguo's Northeast Army. During the 'September 18th' Incident, we retreated into the interior under Chiang Kai-shek's order of non-resistance, and were then forced to be transferred to Shaanxi to 'suppress the communists.' During the Xi'an Incident, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the troops was extremely high. Unexpectedly, after Chiang Kai-shek was released, he forgot his gratitude and imprisoned Zhang Xueliang. The Northeast Army was severely devastated and scattered into the troops of Fu Zuoyi, Wei Lihuang, and others. During the War of Resistance, we were placed on the front line for a long time, and the troops suffered heavy casualties with no replenishment. Take myself as an example, I was a colonel ten years ago, and I am still a colonel today. After the Japanese devils surrendered, we were transferred from Henan to Shandong and forced to 'suppress the communists.' After the ceasefire order, we thought there was hope for peace, but Chiang Kai-shek instructed that the ceasefire order could be 'implemented flexibly.' Therefore, after the 73rd Army was airlifted to Jinan, on June 23rd, we were ordered to attack the liberated areas along the Jiaoji Railway. However, the vast majority of officers and soldiers do not want Chinese people to fight Chinese people. If the civil war continues to expand, I believe that armed uprisings will increase every day."

　　刘士珍对新华社记者称
    蒋军广大官兵不愿内战继续内战起义者将日多
    【新华社临沂八日电】本社记者顷往访于上月二十五日文组（章邱南）率部放下武器之蒋军九十六军暂十五师一团团长刘士珍。刘氏生活安适，精神颇愉快。他说：“我们原为东北军何柱国部骑二军，“九一八”事变时，奉蒋介石不抵抗命令退入关内，随即被迫强令调陕西“剿共”。西安事变时，部队抗日情绪极高，孰料释放蒋介石后，蒋即忘恩负义，囚禁张学良，而东北军则备受摧残，被分散编入傅作义、卫立煌等部。抗战期间长期置于最前线，部队伤亡重大，毫无补充。拿我自己来说，十年前为上校，今日仍为上校。日寇投降后复被由河南调山东，迫令“剿共”。停战令后满以为和平有望，不意蒋介石训令停战令可“机动执行”，于是七十三军空运到济南后，六月二十三日即令我们沿胶济线进攻解放区。但广大官兵均不愿中国人打中国人，如果内战继续扩大，我相信武装起义事件一定会天天增多。”
