　　[This Dispatch from Changzhi] A strong guerrilla group composed of Anyang local armed forces and militia has been covering more than ten thousand people in the border areas and refugees who have escaped, conducting rush harvesting on the border line of more than one hundred *li* on the southern, western, and northern lines since the 18th. On the southern line, our militia, district cadres, and work teams actively cooperated with the × Regiment to organize rush harvesting teams of more than 1,500 people from more than ten villages including Datun, Huangxiaotun, Zhangcun, and Zhangjiagou. On the 18th and 19th, they recovered three-quarters of the cotton and grain in the area, and many other miscellaneous grains and vegetables. In the Seventh District, 1,500 *mu* of cotton were picked in one night. On the western line, Dongzhangwu, Qinxiaotun, Nanguyan, Wuwang, and other villages also launched rush harvesting simultaneously. The militia joint defense, the revenge teams from the occupied areas, and the Henan River defense militia on the north bank of the Huan River, combined with the main force, extended into the blockade of Jiang-puppet strongholds such as Zhangdeng, Yongding, Qugou, Chenjiajing, and East and West Xiasai, to prevent Jiang-puppet troops from harassing. This area is located on the front line of Qugou, and the struggle is extremely fierce, making it impossible to organize large teams for rush harvesting. Therefore, decentralized activities are adopted, and one-half has now been completed. On the northern line, in the Fourth and Tenth Districts, areas such as Qianhou Huangfu, Qiukou, Zhangjiazhuang, Mazhuang, and Guan, the autumn harvest has been successfully completed on the 21st and 22nd, thanks to the strong cooperation of the masses in the rear.
　　During the autumn harvest, the newly and formerly liberated masses fully demonstrated the spirit of unity that all farmers are one family. Militia companies and blasting companies from the old areas rushed to the front line of the border areas to operate. All the refugees, old and young, who escaped from the Jiang-occupied areas went to the fields, and a large number of young and middle-aged people were transferred to organize temporary support teams for rush harvesting. More than 700 refugees from Honggou, Hongyan, Guoli, and other places spontaneously organized themselves to go home for rush harvesting. Dongguyan received the support of the masses and militia in the old areas, and everyone mobilized to rush harvest in a place one *li* away from the Jiang stronghold. The Guo Yuejiang mutual aid group's eleven women, who had just recovered their land in this year's emancipation movement, harvested millet on the land. When the Jiang-puppet troops came to harass, bullets kept flying over their heads, but they looked up at the militia sentry post standing firmly in the desolate graves and still squatted on the ground calmly, waving their sickles nervously. Liu Fulai, a fifty-year-old liberated farmer, clenched his steel gun, lay on the sentry post, and stared at the front all day long without懈怠. He was only emancipated this spring and recovered one and a half *mu* of land and a house. After the Jiang-puppet army occupied Qugou, he automatically joined the militia. He said: "The Communist Party came and gave me good times. The damned old Jiang wants to grab food. If I don't take a gun, who will?" The liberated women in Shangxiabai Village and other villages in the Tenth District all went to the fields for the autumn harvest. An old man in his seventies said: "In the past, it was said that busy spring and busy autumn, embroidered girls get out of bed, but now the liberated area is truly implementing it." The masses in more than a dozen villages, such as Yuyang, East and West Gaoxue, helped the refugees in Taipingdian Muchangtun and other villages to harvest in the deserted areas after the Jiang-puppet looting. The sickles swished, laughter was warm, and the calmness and joy of the farmers in the liberated area were overflowing.
