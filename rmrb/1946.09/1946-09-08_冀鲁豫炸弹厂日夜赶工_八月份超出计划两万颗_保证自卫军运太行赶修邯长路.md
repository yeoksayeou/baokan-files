　　JiluYu Bomb Factory Works Day and Night
    Exceeding August Plan by 20,000 Bombs
    Guaranteeing Self-Defense Army Transport to Taihang to Repair Handan-Changzhi Road
    [Our newspaper, Heze, 6th dispatch] The JiluYu Logistics Bomb Factory, with high production enthusiasm, supports the patriotic self-defense war. In August, it produced 100,000 bombs, exceeding the original plan by 20,000. During the production sprint, everyone refused to rest. In addition to working actively during the day, everyone resolutely requested to work overtime at night. Comrade Wang Pi Ran of the third shift of the sand casting row and his squad leader proposed a competition, saying: "If I can't keep up with you in quantity, I would rather not have the full month's salary." He marked all the molds he made, personally checked the defects after casting the bomb casings, so he could correct them next time. Comrade Wang Chun Xi of the second row set out a new plan: "I will resolutely complete 600 molds every day." People ignored fatigue in the competition, just as Comrade Li Feng Ru of a certain institute said: "We don't complain about the hardship of our sprint, we just blame the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek for wanting to fight a civil war. If we want to not suffer, we must make more bombs, and only when we defeat the reactionaries will we have a good time." Now a large number of bombs are being continuously sent to the front line. In their comfort letter to the soldiers on the front line, they wrote: "Please throw them bravely at the reactionaries! As long as you have a way to make the reactionaries eat them, we here have a way to make them." Moreover, they want to compare the production of the rear with the battles of the front line.
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, 5th dispatch] In order to facilitate commercial transportation and ensure military transportation in the self-defense operation, the Taihang District is undertaking the repair of the main highways of Handan-Changzhi and Changzhi-Xiangyuan. The Taihang Administrative Office has allocated 1.2 million yuan, and the Highway Bureau has formed six construction committees with the counties along the route. The first step of the project is to reduce the slope, repair the necessary bridges, culverts and clean up the road surface, and build drainage ditches so that charcoal cars can run. It is expected that it can be completed before autumn. As for the construction of the two major bridges of Qingzhang and Zhuozhang on the Handan-Changzhi Road, and the leveling of the large slopes of Jimingpu in Shexian County, Shentouling and Biganling in Lucheng County, the project will be started after autumn.

　　冀鲁豫炸弹厂日夜赶工
    八月份超出计划两万颗
    保证自卫军运太行赶修邯长路
    【本报荷泽六日电】冀鲁豫后勤炸弹厂，以高度的生产热情支援爱国自卫战争，八月份生产炸弹十万个，超过原订计划两万。在生产突击中大家拒绝休息，除白天积极工作外，每个人坚决要求打夜工。翻沙排三班王丕冉同志和他的班长提出竞赛说：“在数量上如果赶不上你，我情愿不要全月的工资。”他把自己打的模子都画上记号，铸出弹壳后亲自检查毛病，好下次纠正。二排王春喜同志订出新的计划：“每天坚决完成六百模子。”人们在竞赛中不顾疲劳，正像一所李峰若同志所说的：“咱们的突击受苦，谁也不怨，就怨国民党蒋介石要打内战。要想不受苦，就得多造弹，等到把反动派打败了，才有好时候。”现大批炸弹正源源不断的送往前线，在他们给前线将士的慰劳信中写道：“请你们勇敢的向着反动派扔吧！只要你们有办法叫反动派吃，我们这里就有办法造。”而且他们还要拿后方的生产和前线的战斗比赛。
    【本报长治五日电】为便利商运与保证自卫作战中军运，太行区正着手整修邯（郸）长（治）、与长（治）襄（垣）两公路干线，太行行署特拨款一百二十万元，公路局已与沿路各县分别组成六个施工委员会。第一步工程在削低斜度、修复必要的桥梁，涵洞及整理路面，修筑排水沟，以便能行驶木炭汽车，预计秋前可全部竣工。至修建邯长路清漳浊漳两大桥，修平涉县鸡鸣铺，潞城神头岭、比干岭等大坡工程，行将待秋后兴工。
