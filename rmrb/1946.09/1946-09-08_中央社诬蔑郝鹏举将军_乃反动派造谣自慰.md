　　Central News Agency Slanders General Hao Pengju
    A Delusional Fabrication of the Reactionaries
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] The Central News Agency's Xuzhou dispatch falsely claimed that General Commander Hao Pengju of the Central China Democratic Allied Army "has led his troops to defect and is fighting against the Communist army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway." The Yan'an military spokesperson said that this is a ridiculous rumor that is not worth refuting. It only illustrates one thing: the Chiang Kai-shek clique, having been repeatedly and severely defeated in military affairs, is desperately resorting to constant rumors to comfort its subordinates.

　　中央社诬蔑郝鹏举将军
    乃反动派造谣自慰
    【新华社延安五日电】中央社徐州电诬称：华中民主联军郝鹏举总司令“已率部反正，并在陇海路东段与共军战斗中”。延安军事发言人说，这完全是一个不值一驳的可笑的谣言。它只说明一件事：蒋介石集团已为军事上连续遭受痛击，在穷极无聊之中，只能用不断的造谣来安慰自己的部下。
