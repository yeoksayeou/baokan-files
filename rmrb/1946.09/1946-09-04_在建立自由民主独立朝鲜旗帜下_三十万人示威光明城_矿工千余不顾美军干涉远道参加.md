　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 31st: Moscow Radio reports: The Information Department of the Korean Southern Democratic Front broadcast a message via radio on August 20th stating that on August 18th, the anniversary of the Red Army liberating Korea and defeating Japan, the people of Ronan Province organized a demonstration in Bright City, with approximately 300,000 participants. This demonstration was conducted under the banner of "Establishing a Free, Democratic, and Independent Korea." At the time, 1,140 miners marched from a mine 33 kilometers away to the city to participate in the demonstration. Suddenly, three American planes appeared directly above the miners' heads. Shortly after, two tanks and several cars carrying American soldiers appeared in front of the miners, blocking their path and ordering them to return. However, the miners continued to advance towards Bright City. Several kilometers from Bright City, Korean police in American uniforms, together with American soldiers, opened fire on the demonstrating masses. At the same time, six American planes began strafing with machine guns, causing twenty deaths and injuries on the spot. But the miners did not yield and continued to move forward bravely.

　　在建立自由民主独立朝鲜旗帜下
    三十万人示威光明城
    矿工千余不顾美军干涉远道参加
    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科广播：朝鲜南部民主阵线情报部于八月二十日以无线电广播消息称：八月十八日，在红军解放朝鲜击溃日本一周年纪念日，罗南道人民在光明城组织游行示威，约有三十万人参加。此次游行示威是在为“建立自由民主与独立的朝鲜”的旗帜下进行的。当时有一千一百四十名矿工自离城三十三公里的矿场排队到城市参加游行示威，在矿工正面头上忽然出现三架美国飞机，经过不久，在矿工面前又出现了两辆坦克与几辆装载美国士兵的汽车挡住去路，并命令矿工回去，但矿工还是继续向光明城前进。在离光明城几公里的地方，穿着美国服装的朝鲜警察便与美兵一起开枪射击游行示威群众，同时六架美国飞机亦开始以机枪扫射，当场死伤二十人，但矿工们并不屈服，仍挺身前进。
