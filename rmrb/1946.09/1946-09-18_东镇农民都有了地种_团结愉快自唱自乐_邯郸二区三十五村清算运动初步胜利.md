　　Dongzhen Peasants All Have Land to Till
    United and Happy, Singing and Entertaining Themselves
    Preliminary Victory in the Land Reform Movement in 35 Villages in the Second District of Handan
    [Report from our correspondent in Weixian] After more than a month of emancipation movement in Dongzhen, Ningnan East District, the peasants have settled accounts with 15 despotic landlord households, including Lu Xijiu, and recovered 296 rooms, 6 head of livestock, and 1,777 mu of land. All 1,400 peasants in the village have solved the land problem, eliminated extreme poverty, and initially realized "land to the tiller." In this emancipation movement, all the peasants were united. 648 households in the village, accounting for more than 52% of the total number of households in the village, obtained land, and households that did not receive land but obtained other fruits accounted for more than 43%. The two items together account for 96% of the entire village. Due to the wide distribution of the fruits of the struggle, the unity of the peasants in the entire village has been enhanced. The peasants in the village have not only been emancipated economically and politically, but their class consciousness has also been greatly improved. They have actively participated in their own organizations. The number of members of the peasant association has increased from 382 to 729, and the militia has increased from 36 to 48. The number of members of the women's association has also increased significantly and is still expanding. After the peasants' land problem was solved, their lives improved, and cultural and entertainment activities also developed accordingly. The peasants spontaneously organized theatrical troupes. The farmers, who were usually considered the most stupid, have successively composed their own poems and couplets to express their joy and happiness. Everyone knows that this good fortune was given by Chairman Mao, and they also created many simple and fresh slogans and couplets. For example, Liu Fuhai composed: "Having obtained land and houses, work hard to get rich." Tian Baoshan composed: "You get land, I get houses, the peasants are overjoyed to be liberated."
    [Report from our correspondent in Handan] The land reform movement of 40,000 peasants in the Second District of Handan, from August 20th to September 4th, has achieved victory in 35 major administrative villages such as Cuiqu and Jiazhuang. 20,000 poor peasants have settled accounts with feudal landlords and local bullies to recover land and property, and have initially realized "land to the tiller." They absorbed middle peasants to participate in the movement. In some villages, the mobilization of the masses has reached 90%.
    The reason why this area can achieve such great results in a short period of time is first, due to the success of the anti-traitor movement, which exposed and reformed bad people, trained the masses, and produced a large number of activists. Second, a correct ideological leadership was implemented. In each village, a meeting of cadres was held first to unify the thinking of the cadres, and then it was implemented among the masses, so as to achieve both breadth and depth, and to achieve "wives and children together". Third, leadership was let go. The party's policies were implemented among the masses, and secret liaisons were combined with public appeals to unite the vast majority of peasants. Fourth, a policy of uniting the middle peasants was implemented, and even the well-to-do middle peasants participated in the struggle. A frankness movement was launched against those who had been coerced or induced into becoming traitors in the past, so that they could participate in the movement, which played a considerable role.

　　东镇农民都有了地种
    团结愉快自唱自乐
    邯郸二区三十五村清算运动初步胜利
    【本报威县讯】宁南东区东镇农民经过一个多月的翻身运动，清算了鲁锡九等十五户恶霸地主，收回房屋二百九十六间，牲口六头，土地一千七百七十七亩。全村一千四百个农民解决了土地问题，消灭了赤贫，初步实现了耕者有其田。在这次翻身运动中，团结了所有农民，全村六百四十八户获得土地占全村总户数百分之五十二强，未得到土地而得到其他果实户占百分之四十三强，两项共占全村百分之九十六，由于斗争果实分配的面宽，增强了全村农民的团结，该村农民不只在经济上政治上翻了身，阶级觉悟也大为提高，纷纷参加自己的组织，现农会会员已由三百八十二人增到七百二十九人，民兵由三十六人增到四十八人，妇女会会员亦大有增加，现仍在扩大中。农民土地问题解决后，生活改善，文化娱乐活动也随之开展，农民自动组织剧团，平常被认为最笨的庄稼汉，纷纷自编诗歌、对联，来表示自己喜悦愉快的心情，每个人都懂得，这光景是毛主席给的，也创作出好多朴素、新鲜的标语和对联。如刘福海编：“得到土地和房屋，努力做活要致富。”田宝善编的：“你分土地我分房，农民翻身喜洋洋。”
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸二区四万农民的清算运动，从八月二十日起至九月四日止，已在崔曲、贾庄等三十五个主要行政村获得胜利。两万贫苦农民从封建地主恶霸手里算回土地和财物，初步实现了耕者有其田。他们在运动中吸收中农参加。好些村庄已达到发动群众的百分之九十。
    该地区能在短时期中收到这样大的成果，第一是由于反奸运动的成功，暴露与改造了坏人，锻炼了群众，涌现了大批积极分子。第二、实行了正确的思想领导。各村都是先开干部会，打通干部思想，再贯彻到群众中去，达到既广泛又深入，作到了“老婆孩子一齐来”。第三、放手领导。把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，以秘密串连，结合公开号召，团结绝大多数农民。第四、实行了团结中农的政策，连富裕中农都参加了斗争。对过去胁从诱从之奸伪分子发动坦白运动，使他们参加到运动中去，起了相当大的作用。（冷冰）
