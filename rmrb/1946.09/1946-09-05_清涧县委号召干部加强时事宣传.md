Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. The Qingjian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, at a recent joint meeting of district secretaries and district heads, called on cadres to strengthen their study of current affairs in order to strengthen the dissemination of current affairs to the masses. For several years, district and township cadres in the county only promoted production to the masses when they went to the countryside, and rarely explained current affairs, resulting in some masses not having enough understanding of current affairs. Recently, the county carried out current affairs propaganda in twenty-one villages in conjunction with disaster relief, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. When a cadre explained to the villagers of Shijiagou in the Third District about how the Communist Party led the people of the liberated areas to stand up and how the Kuomintang reactionaries slaughtered and oppressed the people at a village meeting, the villagers listened attentively and did not tire late into the night. When it was said that the strength of the people in the liberated areas was developing, someone said: "During the land revolution, the Red Army had few people and poor guns, but they still won battles. Now, it goes without saying. Chiang Kai-shek will be unlucky if he attacks." And demanded: "It would be good to hold more such meetings in the future. We farmers are stuck in the mountains, so if you publicize more, we will feel brighter in our hearts." From this propaganda, it can be seen that the masses are very concerned about current affairs, and it is not as some cadres think: "Farmers only care about farming and do not care about current affairs."

　　清涧县委号召干部
    加强时事宣传
    【新华社延安一日电】陕甘宁边区中共清涧县委，在最近召开之区书区长联席会上，号召干部加强时事学习，以便加强对群众宣传时事，该县区乡干部几年来下乡时只给群众宣传生产，很少讲解时事，致使一些群众对时事认识不够，最近该县配合救灾在二十一个村庄内进行了时事宣传，受到群众热烈欢迎，一位干部在三乡师家沟村民大会讲解共产党领导解放区群众翻身，国民党反动派屠杀压迫人民的事实时，村民凝神静听，夜深不倦。当说到解放区人民力量发展时，有人说：“土地革命时，红军人少枪炮也不好还打胜仗，现在更不用说了，蒋介石要进攻非倒霉不可。”并要求：“这样的会以后多开才好。我们农民钻在山圪＠里，你们多宣传我们心里才明亮。”从这次宣传中，看出群众十分关心时事，并不如有些干部想的：“农民只顾种地，不管时事不时事。”
