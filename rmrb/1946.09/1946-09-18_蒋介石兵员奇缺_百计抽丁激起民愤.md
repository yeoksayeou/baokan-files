Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 14th: Chiang Kai-shek's army is facing a severe shortage of soldiers. A nationwide conscription began on the 3rd, sparking widespread popular resistance. Since mid-July, nearly 200,000 Chiang's troops have been wiped out in the civil war, and the number of deserters is even greater. According to an article published in the Shanghai Wen Cui magazine on the 1st of last month, the number of deserters has increased almost doubled compared to the anti-Japanese war. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly ordered local governments to draft and capture men. Last month, the country was divided into 42 military control zones, with a plan to conscript 80,000 men each from the Northeast and Tianjin areas alone, and 2,000 men from each county near Nanjing. The headquarters of the Kuomintang Youth Army 208th Division has moved to Beiping to specialize in recruiting soldiers, planning to forcibly conscript 14,000 members of the Youth Army in Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shijiazhuang, and other places. The Youth Army, which had been demobilized and housed in "University Remedial Classes" and "Youth Middle Schools" in Hanzhong, has recently been ordered to rearm. At the same time, Nanjing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places are using forms such as "Civilian Training," "Militia," "Volunteer Corps," "Study Classes," "Business Training Corps," and "Youth Training" to force citizens to receive training and select new recruits from them. It is planned to draw 7,000 men from Jinan alone, and 3,000 from Tianjin. People in various places have expressed opposition to this matter, or have escaped by various means, and have even fled to the liberated areas in groups. The entire "Returning Home Brigade" of Lutai on the Beining Railway has dispersed and returned to their hometowns. Conscripts in Yingkou fled in droves during physical examinations. An old woman in Suizhong committed suicide in front of the municipal government to prevent her son from joining the army. After the conscription order was issued in Chongqing, the National Public Bulletin took the lead in criticizing it. Even the youths in the army are demanding demobilization. According to a letter published in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 19th of last month, Wen Shihua of the Youth Army stationed in Shenyang wrote: "Schools have started, but who cares about our resumption of studies? The desire for knowledge is burning in the hearts of thousands of our comrades, and we sincerely appeal to your newspaper." Due to popular opposition, Chiang Kai-shek's conscription plan has encountered serious difficulties. For example, in Shenyang alone, Chiang Kai-shek twice ordered the conscription of 6,500 men by the end of July, but by mid-August, less than half of the quota had been filled. The Tianjin Youth Army Recruitment Committee, which was established last month, has also not yet produced any results.

　　蒋介石兵员奇缺
    百计抽丁激起民愤
    【新华社延安十四日电】国民党军队兵员奇缺，三日起开始全国性征兵，激起人民普遍反抗。自七月中旬以来，蒋军在内战中被歼近二十万人，逃亡者尤众，据上月一日沪文萃杂志刊文估计，比抗战中逃亡数字增加几达一倍。蒋介石乃急忙下令各地抽丁抓丁。并于上月将全国划为四十二个军管区，预定仅东北平津两地区即各抽征八万名，南京附近各县每县抽征二千名。国民党青年军二○八师师部已移驻北平，专司招兵，预定在平津青岛石家庄等地强征青年军一万四千名。汉中收容于“大学补习班”及“青年中学”等处已经复员的青年军，近亦奉令恢复武装，同时南京、济南、太原、重庆、青岛、天津等地，又利用“市民训练”、“民兵”、“义勇队”、“学习班”、“商训团”、“青年训练”等形式强迫市民受训，从中选拔新兵。预定仅济南即抽拔七千名，天津三千名。各地人民对此事则表示反对，或则用各种方法逃避，甚至成群逃入解放区。北宁路芦台之“还乡大队”已全体逃散回乡。营口壮丁于检查身体时即纷纷逃亡。绥中一老妇为拒绝儿子当兵而碰死在市政府门前。重庆征兵令下后，国民公报首起著论痛斥。即在伍青年亦要求复员，据上月十九日天津大公报载驻沈阳之青年军文世华投书内称：“目前学校也开学了，可是有谁过问我们的复学问题？求知欲在我们几千同志的心中燃烧着，我们诚挚的向贵报控诉。”由于人民反对，蒋介石的征兵计划已遭遇严重困难，如沈阳一地，蒋曾两次下令限七月底抽征六千五百名，但直到八月中旬，仍未满配额半数。天津青年军招收委员会自上月成立迄今，也尚无结果。
