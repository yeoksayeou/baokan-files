　　A Collection of Congratulatory Messages Celebrating the Opening of Handan Xinhua Broadcasting Station

　　You gloriously represent the will and voice of 30 million people, opposing the autocrat Chiang Kai-shek's waging of civil war and the American imperialists' armed interference in China's internal affairs. With you, the people can spread the heroic self-defense struggle and the great achievements of democratic construction to all of China and the world. Your birth means you are the people's most loyal and reliable person. Under your call, the people will organize and act to strive for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland!
　　中共太岳区党委 (Taiyue District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party)

　　Representing the voice of the Chinese people, propagating the truth, exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameless rumors, and striving for the complete victory of the Chinese people's patriotic self-defense war.
　　Taiyue Administrative Office Director Niu Peicong

　　You have shattered the chains of numerous difficulties and stand majestically before the Chinese and foreign people, emitting a heroic voice, broadcasting the cheers and roars of the people in the border region, conveying the cries and appeals of the people in the enemy-occupied areas, and striking at the shameless clamor of the fascist warmongers. You are no less than adding 100,000 brave soldiers to our border region people, greatly enhancing the confidence of our liberated area's soldiers and civilians in winning the patriotic war. In excitement, we hereby send a telegram of congratulations!
　　Taiyue Military Region Headquarters, Political Department

　　When we heard your first sentence and first sound, 30 million people were inspired! This is the first time in thousands of years that 30 million people have had the opportunity to speak directly to the whole country and the whole world. This is a great achievement of our party on the propaganda front, and it is a more perfect grasp of the weapon of news struggle to serve the people.
