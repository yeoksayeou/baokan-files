Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 17th. The flax factory directors' joint meeting recently held here decided to massively develop hand spinning, recruit spinners, and stipulate specific methods. The factory will loan spinning wheels and tools. Wages are tentatively set at three grades: 60 yuan, 50 yuan, and 40 yuan per jin. Each spinner must not lose more than 5% of the yarn. The factory will buy back the saved yarn within the loss amount at the corresponding price. To encourage new spinners, they can receive half a jin of practice cotton from the factory for practice. Each factory also plans to recruit a large number of agents in various towns and villages to promote the work. A large number of women in Yi'an and Keshan counties have signed up to spin. The Bei'an County government is using material rewards to encourage outstanding and enthusiastic spinners, which has further encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for spinning. The flax factory can now produce 5,000 to 6,000 jin of cotton per day. If all of it is spun into cloth, it can reach 40,000 chi. However, due to a lack of machines, initially only hand spinning can be developed. According to the current flax production, it is necessary to mobilize 20,000 hand-cranked spinning wheels and 500 foot-operated iron wheel machines to meet the needs. Now the Party, government, military and people of the entire province are working towards this goal. Flax factories in Baiquan and Keshan have already spun flax cloth by hand, which is strong, durable and no less than cotton cloth. According to the person in charge of the flax factory, several months of work have proved that we will definitely be able to smash the reactionary blockade and solve the clothing problem ourselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 17th. Heilongjiang Province has invented the method of making cotton from flax, which has special significance for the province, which lacks cotton and produces flax. The inventor is Qi Mingzhang, a shop assistant from Yangxinglong Store in Yize County. He had long wanted to use flax to solve the problem of cotton substitutes. After painstaking research, he used caustic soda to boil the flax, and then used a cotton gin to process it. As a result, he successfully produced fine and even cotton fiber that was long, warm and no less than high-quality cotton. He is now preparing to raise more capital for mass production.

　　黑省党政军民一致努力
    推广亚麻纺织运动
    齐明章发明以麻制棉
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十七日电】此间近召开亚麻工厂厂长联席会议，决定大量发展手工纺织，招请纺户，并规定具体办法，由工厂贷给纺车工具，工资暂定每斤六十元、五十元和四十元三等，每纺纱一斤不得损耗百分之五，损耗数内节省之纱线由工厂按等付价收买。为鼓励新纺手，彼等可向厂方领取学习棉半斤，用以练习。各厂并拟在各城镇村贩招请大批代办户以资推广。依安、克山各县已有大批妇女报名承纺，北安县府以物质奖励成绩优良及热心的纺户，更加鼓舞了群众的纺线情绪，亚麻工厂现每日能出棉五千至六千斤，如全部纺成布则可达四万尺。但由于机器缺乏，初步只能发展手工纺织，根据现在亚麻产量，必须发动二万架手摇纺车与五百台脚踏铁轮机始敷应用，现全省党政军民均一致为此目标努力。拜泉、克山两地亚麻工厂已用手工纺出亚麻布，坚实耐用不亚棉布。根据亚麻工厂负责人谈，几个月的工作，证明我们一定能够粉碎反动派的封锁，自己动手解决穿衣问题。
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十七日电】黑龙江省发明以线麻制造棉花，此事对于缺棉产麻的该省，有特殊意义，发明者为依择县内洋兴隆柜伙齐明章，他很早就想用线麻解决棉的代用品问题，经苦心研究于是就用可性曹达，将线麻煮过，然后用打棉机打过，结果试验出又细又匀棉花纤绒，又长又保暖，不次于特好棉花，现正准备增募股本，进行大量生产。
