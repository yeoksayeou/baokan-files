　　Towards People's Literature and Art
    Guo Moruo
    In its original stage, literature and art only have one form: people's literature and art, collectively created, collectively enjoyed, and collectively preserved by the public. It is a direct reflection of people's lives. The people's joys, anger, sorrows, loves, hates, and all desires are expressed frankly in the people's language, and at the same time, it fulfills its ability to lead life, criticize life, and improve life. It is a common treasure of society and a common wealth of mankind. The ancient literature and art of any civilized nation or the existing literature and art of backward nations contain endless beauty and have universal and eternal value. Why is this so? The reason is simple: because the production of this kind of literature and art best fits the essence of literature and art.

    As human society became differentiated, literature and art also became differentiated. There was literature and art specifically designed to please the upper-class rulers, and there was literature and art that remained at the lower levels and was still enjoyed by the people. Those who flattered the upper class were subordinate to the power of the rulers and achieved success by currying favor, gradually being regarded as the orthodoxy of literature and art, occupying a dominant position, and the good name of literature and art was almost exclusively occupied by them. Those who remained at the lower levels became vulgar things unworthy of high society. However, the history of Chinese literature and art development tells us that only these vulgar things are the mainstream of literature and art. The so-called orthodox aristocratic literature and art or temple literature and art are actually deformed tumors that have entered dead-end branches.

    Every time a dynasty changed in China, a new form of literature and art almost always appeared. Tracing back to the origin of these new literary forms, they all originated from the folk. The changers of dynasties were grassroots heroes who rose from the people, so with the new dynasty, new folk forms ascended to the court. But just as people who ascend to the halls soon lose their humanity, literature and art that ascended to the court soon lost their literary nature. A history of the Twenty-Four Dynastic Histories is a history of the slaughter between the people and the aristocracy, and a history of literature and art is also a history of the slaughter between people's literature and art and aristocratic literature and art. But dynasties after dynasties left behind the corpses of aristocratic literature and art, while the people and people's literature and art have always flowed mightily.

    Of China's literary heritage, only that part that has not separated from people's lives and has not separated from people's language is the eternally valuable and living essence. Folk songs since the Zhou and Qin dynasties, lyrics of the Five Dynasties, songs of the Yuan dynasty, and novels of the Ming dynasty—there are many crystals of this essence. The so-called Yang Xiong, Sima Xiangru, Ban Gu, Zhang Heng, Wang Can, Yang Xiu, Lu Ji, Luo Tong, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi, those literati and their works who specialized in flattering the upper class, are, strictly speaking, really the dregs among the dregs. I ask, what glory do the ancient fu of the Han dynasties, the骈丽 of the Six Dynasties, and the classical prose of the Tang and Song dynasties have today? Aren't those, like the eight-legged essays of the Ming and Qing dynasties, useless objects?

    The people have always defended the mainstream of literature and art. Although today we cannot know for sure who the author of *Water Margin* is—whether it is Shi Nai'an, Luo Guanzhong, or a collective creation by the two of them or others—its literary and social value cannot be matched by any temple literature and art. The people do not need the author's official title and status, but rather works that nourish and the nourishing power in the works. Millet, rice, and sorghum, pine, cedar, and cypress trees are all valued by every household, while strange potted plants are playthings for those who have separated from normal life to find comfort. Please try placing a potted plant on the edge of a large forest and playing with it, how pitiful its weakness is!

    Today is the century of the people, and it is time to restore the orthodoxy of all values. Everything should be based on the people. What conforms to this basis is good, beautiful, and true; what does not conform to this basis is evil, ugly, and false. We want to create things that are true, good, and beautiful, which is to create things that are people-oriented. This is the principle of literary and artistic creation today. Young people of the present era who aspire to literature and art should naturally write literature and art that is based on the people. What the people most urgently need today is also the most urgent task of today's literary and art workers. Being able to grasp and answer this question in detail and comprehensively will be welcomed by the people and may be the greatest work. We often hear people say that since the May Fourth Movement, no achievements in China's new literature and art have been worthy of being called great works. If we want to pursue the main reason for this, it should be that literary and art workers have not seriously considered the needs of the people and provided satisfactory supply. There is a vast and boundless virgin land left here, waiting for young literary and art workers to cultivate it.

    How should we cultivate this virgin land? The prerequisite is to grasp the ideology of being people-oriented, to eradicate all the old roots and rotten roots of the feudal era, and to thoroughly cultivate oneself into an owner of scientific and democratic thought. What kind of seeds can produce what kind of trees, what kind of trees can bloom what kind of flowers, and bear what kind of fruits—this cannot be faked. Thistles cannot grow tangerines, and wormwood cannot grow grapes. Before being able to write democratic literary works, one must first be a democratic person. All ideas that do not conform to the category of democracy must be ruthlessly and strictly self-corrected. One must not become anything above or outside the people. Everything must be sought from practical life for proper solutions. Pioneers have refined a correct thought from practical life, and the process of this thought's generation clearly has life first. But for us latecomers, we can regulate life according to a correct thought, and the process of experiencing this thought is life later. For example, there is surveying before a map is created, which is the former; traveling according to a map, which is the latter. Traveling according to a map is not a disgrace; only in this way can geographical knowledge take root, and based on one's own experience, the knowledge on the map can be transformed into one's own knowledge, and it can be supplemented or corrected. In this way, thought and life are intertwined, becoming the basis of writing. Thoughts that are not based on practical life are idealistic eight-legged essays, and descriptions of life that are not guided by thought are yellow newspaper news. Thought, life, and writing should be a trinity.

    Feudal thoughts are too deeply rooted in our consciousness, and its network permeates every corner of society. Our views on any issue easily fall into this network without us being aware. For example, we shout "literature and art to the countryside," thinking that this is a very progressive democratic thought, but why do we shout "to the countryside" instead of "to the village"? This shows that we still despise the people and the common folk. We ourselves are high above, while the "country folk" of the common people are low below. This seems to be a trivial matter, but in fact it is a fundamental issue in the transformation of thought. Today, those of us engaged in literature and art should sincerely learn from the common people. If we still look down on the common people, how can we learn? That old habit of looking down on the common people should be thoroughly eradicated like treating gonorrhea and syphilis. Perhaps some people will doubt, saying that you are just learning the fashion with these words, "Learn from the common people, learn from the common people." What outstanding wisdom do the common people have that is worth learning from us? To build the Yangtze River dam, we know to find Savage; to manufacture atomic bombs, we can only find scientific experts. Why do we have to "learn from the common people" when it comes to literature and art?——That's right, not wrong at all. There are experts in water management for water management, experts in atomic bomb manufacturing for atomic bomb manufacturing, and literature and art are reflections of life, and the common people are experts in life. If we want to represent farmers, why not learn from farmers? If we want to represent workers, why not learn from workers? Farmers and workers are more specialized in the aspects of workers' and farmers' lives than any PhDs, masters, presidents, or archbishops. Why shouldn't we learn from them? In the early 19th century, the great French painter Delacroix did not paint white foam at the corners of the mouth of a galloping horse, and was criticized by a groom. The groom was an expert in being familiar with the life of horses. The bad habit of looking down on the common people really deserves bitter criticism. We must learn from the common people, learn the language of the common people, grasp the living habits of the common people, take the likes and dislikes of the common people as our likes and dislikes, and according to the demands of the common people, we love them extremely, and contrary to the demands of the common people, we hate them extremely. From such extreme love, we write our praises; from such extreme hatred, we roar out our curses.

    Such literature and art will certainly not be appreciated by adults and gentlemen, but the people will appreciate you. When the people truly become the masters of the day, statues of Shi Nai'an and Luo Guanzhong will stand tall everywhere.

### 走向人民文艺

　　走向人民文艺
    郭沫若
    文艺在它原始的阶段上是只有着一种形态的，便是由公众所集体创作，集体享受，集体保存的人民文艺。它是人民生活的直接反映。人民的喜怒哀乐好恶和一切愿望，用人民的言语，直率地表达出来，同时也就尽了它的领导生活，批判生活，改善生活的能事。它是社会共同的财宝，也是人类共同的财富，任何开化民族的古代文艺或落后民族的现成文艺，都蕴含着无尽藏的美，而有普遍永恒的价值。何以会这样？理由很简单，是因为这种文艺的产生最契合于文艺的本质。
    人类社会有了分化，文艺因而也有了分化，有专门向上层统治者取媚的文艺，有留在下层仍然为人民所享用的文艺。取媚上层者隶属于统治者的权势之下，得到攀龙附凤的结果，逐渐被视为文艺的正统，而盘据着支配者的地位，文艺的美名更几几乎为它所独占了。留在下层的，成为了不足以登大雅之堂的土俗东西。然而中国的一部文艺发展史告诉我们，只有这种土俗的东西才是文艺的本流，所谓正统的贵族文艺或庙堂文艺，其实是走入了断港横塘的畸形的赘瘤。
    中国每逢换一次朝代，差不多就有一种新的文艺形式出现。这新的文艺形式，追溯起来都是起源于民间。朝代的换取者是由民间起来的草莽英雄，故随着新朝新代便有新的民间形式登上庙堂。但和登上厅堂的人不久便失掉了它的人性一样，登上了庙堂的文艺不久也就失掉了它的文性。一部二十四史是人民和贵族的斫杀史，一部文艺史也是人民文艺和贵族文艺的斫杀史。但历朝历代留下了贵族文艺的尸骸，而人民和人民文艺却始终是浩浩荡荡地流着。
    中国的文艺遗产，只有没有脱离人民生活，没有脱离人民言语的那一部分，是永远有价值有生命的精华。周秦以来的民间歌谣，五代的词，元代的曲，明朝的小说，这里面正有不少的这种精华的结晶。所谓扬马班张，王扬卢骆，韩柳欧苏，那些专门逢迎上层的文人及其作品，认真说，实在是糟粕中的糟粕。试问两汉的古赋，六朝的骈丽，唐宋的古文，在今天究竟有什么光彩呢？那些不是和明清的八股一样，都是无用的长物吗？
    人民始终是保卫着文艺的本流的，一部水浒传，虽然在今天我们还不能确切地知道它的作者究竟是谁？是施耐庵，是罗贯中，是他们两人或和其他别人的集体创作，但他的文艺价值和社会价值，没有任何庙堂文艺可以和它比配。人民并不需要作者的官衔和地位，而是需要有滋养的作品和作品中的养力。黍稷稻粱，松杉桧柏，家家都知道保重，奇形怪象盆栽，那是脱离了正常生活者的慰情聊胜无的玩弄品。请你把一个盆栽放在大森林的边沿去偿玩，那贫弱相是多么的可怜呵！
    今天是人民的世纪，一切价值是应该恢复正统的时候。一切应该以人民为本位，合乎这个本位的便是善，便是美，便是真，不合乎这个本位的便是恶，便是丑，便是伪。我们要制造真善美的东西，也就是要制造人民本位的东西。这是文艺创作的今天的原则。现时代的青年如有志于文艺，自然是应该写作这样以人民为本位的文艺。人民在今天所最迫切需要的是什么，也就是今天的文艺工作者最迫切的课题。能够把这个课题抓紧解答，而且解答的详尽周到，那便是为人民所欢迎的东西，也可能就是最伟大的作品。我们时常听见人说，自五四运动以来，中国的新文艺里面还没有够得上称为伟大作品的成绩出现，假如要追求它的主要的原因，那应该就是文艺工作者还没有认真体贴到人民的需要，而给予以满足的供给。这儿正留着一个宏大无垠的处女地，等待着文艺青年们来垦辟。
    应该怎样来垦辟这个处女地呢？先决的问题是在于人民本位的思想的把握，要把封建时代的一切陈根腐蒂肃清，彻内彻外地养成为一个科学的民主的思想的所有者。是什么种子才能生出什么树木，是什么树木才能开出什么花朵，结出什么果实，这是不能够假冒的。蒺藜上生不出密橘，蓬蒿上长不出葡萄。在能写作民主文艺作品之前必须首先是民主的人，凡是不合乎民主范畴的一切想法都必须毫不容情的严密的自行纠正，自己不能成为人民以上或以外的任何东西。一切必须于生活实践中求取正当的解决。先驱者在生活实践中提炼出了一种正确的思想，这思想的发生过程分明是生活在先。但在我们后进者则可以根据一种正确的思想以规范生活，这思想的体验过程是生活在后。譬如先有测量而生地图，这是前一种，依据地图而旅行，这是后一种。依据地图旅行并不是耻辱，要这样才能使地理智识生根，根据自己的体验，使地图上的智识化为自己的智识，可能补充或修正它。就这样思想与生活交织，成为写作的基本。没有生活实践的思想搬弄便是唯心主义的八股，没有思想规范的生活描写便是黄色报纸的新闻。思想，生活，写作应该是三位一体。
    封建思想在我们的意识里植根太深，在社会的每一个角落里也弥漫着它的网络，我们对于任何问题的看法，很轻易的便落在这种网落里而不自觉察。例如我们在喊“文章下乡”，以为这是很前进的民主思想了，然而为什么不喊“上乡”而要喊“下乡”呢？这可见我们还是轻视人民，轻视老百姓的，我们自己是高高乎在上，而老百姓的“乡下人”是低低乎在下的。这似乎是无关宏旨的区区小节，但其实是思想转换上的根本问题。今天我们搞文艺的人是应该诚心诚意向老百姓学习的，假如依然看不起老百姓，那学习从何说起？看不起老百姓的那种旧毛病，应当如医治淋病梅毒一样，使他彻底断根。或许有人会怀疑，你这样说说也不过学学时髦，什么“向老百姓学习，向老百姓学习”，老百姓究竟有什么了不起的智慧值得我们学习呢？要建筑长江水闸，我们晓得萨凡奇，要制造原子弹，我们只得找科学专家，为什么谈到文艺我们偏要“向老百姓学习”？——不错，一点也不错。治水有治水的专家，造原子弹有造原子弹的专家，文艺是生活的反映，而老百姓就是生活的专家。我们要表现农人，为什么不向农人学习？我们要表现工人，为什么不向工人学习？农人工人在工农生活方面比任何博士硕士，大总统大主教还要专门，我们为什么不向他们学习？十九世纪初期的法国大画家德勒珂罗亚画奔马在口角上没有画白沫，受了一位马夫的指摘，马夫在熟习马的生活上便是专家。看不起老百姓的坏习惯，实在是应该苦加针砭的了。我们要向老百姓学习，学习老百姓的言语，把握老百姓的生活习惯，以老百姓的好恶为好恶，依老百姓的要求者，我们极端的爱他，反乎老百姓的要求者，我们极端的恨他。由这样极端的爱，写出我们的颂扬；由这样极端的憎，吼出我们的咒诅。
    这样的文艺当然得不到大人先生们的赞赏，但人民会赞赏你们。到了人民真正成了主人的一天，施耐庵和罗贯中的铜像会遍地林立的。
