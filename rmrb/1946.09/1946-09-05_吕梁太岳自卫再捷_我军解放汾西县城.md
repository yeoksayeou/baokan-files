　　【This newspaper's Yangcheng, 1st, urgent telegram】The Taiyue and Lüliang Eighth Route Armies, through victorious self-defense counterattacks, liberated Fenxi County Town on the 29th of last month. Yan's troops abandoned the city and fled at dawn that day. Thus, the Taiyue and Lüliang liberated areas have been joined into one. Lüliang district troops, amid the welcome of the people, have entered the city, actively carrying out relief and restoration work. At the same time, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army, in counterattacking Yan's puppet troops reinforcing the Lingishi area north of Lingshi, successively liberated Liangdu Town (20 li north of Lingshi) and Lengquan Station (35 li north of Lingshi). During the battle to liberate Liangdu, one company of Yan's soldiers revolted on the front line, carrying with them two machine guns, one small cannon, one grenade launcher, and 51 rifles. The Second Regiment of Yan's 39th Division, south of Yunshi, was isolated and awaiting reinforcements and immediately abandoned strongholds such as Nanguan Town and Xujiadian, fleeing to Fujiatan (between Nanguan and Xujiadian) to join up with more than a thousand puppet mine police left over from the Japanese invaders, attempting to hold this famous mining area on the southern Tongpu Line. Fujiatan is now completely surrounded by our Eighth Route Army. Currently, 270 *huali* of the railway south of Yitang Town in Jiexiu and north of Luqu in eastern Linfen, except for the isolated stronghold of Fujiatan, are entirely under our control.

    我军解放汾西县城
    【本报阳城一日急电】太岳、吕梁八路军自卫反击胜利，已于上月二十九日，解放汾西县城，阎军于当日拂晓弃城逃窜，至此，我太岳与吕梁两解放区已联成一片，吕梁区部队在人民欢迎中，进驻该城，积极进行救济、恢复工作。与此同时太岳八路军在灵石以北反击增援灵石地区阎伪军，相继解放两渡镇（灵石北二十里）及冷泉车站（灵石北三十五里）。在解放两渡战争中，阎军一连士兵在火线上起义，携带机枪两挺、小炮一门、掷弹筒一个、步枪五十一支。云石以南阎军三十九师二团孤守待援，当即放弃南关镇许家店等据点，窜往傅家滩（在南关与许家店之间）与日寇遗流之伪矿警千余人会合，企图据守此同蒲南线著名矿区，傅家滩已为我八路军完全包围。现介休义棠镇以南，临汾东芦曲以北之铁路二百七十华里，除傅家滩孤立据点外，已全部为我控制。
