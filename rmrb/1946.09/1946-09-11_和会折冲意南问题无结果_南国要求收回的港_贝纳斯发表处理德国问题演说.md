　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the sixth week of the Paris Peace Conference has been characterized by the Trieste and Italian-Yugoslav border issues becoming the focus of the conference's discussions. This issue is currently under unresolved debate within the Italian Political and Territorial Committee, awaiting further negotiation among the Big Four. The dispute originates from the Italian representative Bonomi's proposal to the committee on the 2nd, advocating for the expansion of the Free Territory of Trieste to the southeast. This proposal was rejected by the Yugoslav representative, who also opposed the Foreign Ministers Council's acceptance of the French proposal line as the agreement for the Italian-Yugoslav border. In subsequent discussions, the Czechoslovak representative supported Yugoslavia's claims to the entire Istrian Peninsula, except for the Free Territory of Trieste. The Polish representative opposed the establishment of the Free Territory of Trieste, arguing that this "international condominium might create another dangerous point in Europe." He cited the failure of free cities such as Danzig and Fiume after World War I, arguing that the Trieste area should be ceded to Yugoslavia to prevent the resurgence of Italian aggression. The Byelorussian representative believed that the Big Four's proposal should be completely changed, advocating for the transfer of Gorizia, the second-largest city on the Istrian Peninsula, to Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the New Zealand representative proposed that the western part of the Istrian Peninsula (part of which the Big Four proposed to cede to Yugoslavia) also be under international administration. The Brazilian representative took the issue even further, advocating that the Big Four appoint a new committee of experts to make new recommendations on the Trieste port issue, reporting within a year. The Soviet representative rejected this idea, arguing that postponing it for a year would cause a crisis and further complicate the issue. Vyshinsky believed that Yugoslavia's demands were legitimate, but the Soviet Union still supported the Foreign Ministers Council's decision in order to reach a quick solution. The British representative opposed Yugoslavia having a "special status" in the administrative control of the Trieste area, threatening that if this were the case, Britain would reconsider the entire agreement. Due to such divergent opinions among the representatives of various countries, this issue made no progress in the Italian Political and Territorial Committee at the beginning of the month.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Stuttgart, Southern Germany: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes arrived here yesterday from Berlin and delivered a speech on handling the German problem. At a time when the deadlock of the Paris Peace Conference (limited to dealing with the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland) is waiting to be broken, Byrnes raised the complex German problem. In his speech, Byrnes avoided mentioning the fact that fascist forces had not been eliminated in the British and American occupation zones of Germany. Instead, he advocated for "the immediate establishment of a temporary central government in Germany, suggested the establishment of a German State Council to direct national affairs under Allied control, and to prepare a constitution for the German Federation." Byrnes also declared: "The United States has no intention of withdrawing from Germany, and the United States will remain as long as it is necessary to occupy Germany." Regarding the issue of German territory, Byrnes declared: "Except for the Saar being assigned to France and Königsberg being assigned to the Soviet Union, the United States will oppose any dismemberment of Germany, especially the cession of Germany's Ruhr and Rhineland regions." Byrnes also hinted that the United States would not agree to permanently cede Lower Silesia, currently occupied by Poland, to Poland, according to the Potsdam Agreement. According to the decision of the Potsdam Conference last August: "The leaders of the three governments unanimously believe that before the western border of Poland is determined, the former eastern territory of Germany, that is, from the Baltic Sea west of Swinemünde along the Oder River to the confluence of the western section of the Neisse River, then from the western section of the Neisse River to the Czech border, including East Prussia, which was decided by this conference not to be governed by the Soviet Union, including the former Free City of Danzig, should be governed by the Polish government." It is also reported that Byrnes left Stuttgart last night by special train for Munich. He will spend the weekend in Bavaria and return to Paris on Sunday night.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Paris: The Foreign Ministers Council held its third meeting last night, with Molotov personally attending. Byrnes was absent, represented by his assistant Dunn. Bevin chaired the meeting, which lasted two and a half hours. When discussing the session of the United Nations General Assembly, Bidault said he was willing to consider postponing the United Nations General Assembly. Bevin said he did not agree to the postponement, but if the postponement was not too long and did not overturn the proposed meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the German issue, he would be willing to consider the matter. Molotov also proposed temporarily moving the venue of the United Nations General Assembly to Paris or Geneva, but no agreement was reached. The foreign ministers agreed not to meet again until Byrnes returned to Paris, and the next meeting is likely to be on Sunday night. United Nations General Assembly President Spaak has been invited to attend.
