    Commissioner Fan Visits Sick and Comforts Xiyang Women Washing Bloody Clothes
    Shi Ming
    [Our newspaper Changzhi, 17th dispatch] The Second Sub-district troops returned victoriously from the counter-attack on the Zhengtai Railway. The masses along the way joyfully sent comfort goods and watched the prisoners of war and the new American weapons we seized. As soon as the wounded arrived at the hospital, various groups from Zuoquan and the local opera troupes rushed to offer their condolences. On August 29th, Commissioner Fan, dragging his thin body weakened by malaria, personally took 100,000 yuan in Hebei currency to visit the wounded in each ward, comforting them with kind and gentle words to rest and recuperate. This concern and care from the government moved the hearts of every glorious wounded comrade. Everyone excitedly said, "Commissioner Fan represents the people in treating us this way. When we recover, we will go to the front line" and be sure to repay the old folks' kindness in taking care of us. (Shi Ming)
    [Another dispatch] The soldiers and sick and wounded returning victoriously from the Zhengtai Railway were warmly welcomed and comforted by the people of Xiyang. Women were busy washing bloody clothes for the wounded, boiling water, and cooking. Young people immediately carried white flour, vermicelli, mutton… to send to the troops. They said, "These are our saviors. If it weren't for them last year, who knows if we would be dead or alive by now." They personally cooked for the troops and fed the wounded soldiers by hand, moving the wounded soldiers to tears. They also said, "You liberated us here last year and then didn't come back. You must stay here a few more days." In the evening, the Xiyang opera troupe came to perform for them to express their condolences.
