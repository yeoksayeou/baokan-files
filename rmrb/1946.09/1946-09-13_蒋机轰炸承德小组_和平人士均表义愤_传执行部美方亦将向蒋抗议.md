Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: The bombing of the Chengde Executive Group by Chiang Kai-shek's planes has aroused indignation among people of peace. It is reported that the U.S. representative of the Peiping Executive Headquarters also had to condemn the brutality of Chiang's planes. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on September 7th: "Sources familiar with the Executive Group say: It is expected that American officials... will lodge a serious and strong protest to Chiang Kai-shek." The source also said: In theory, the air force should abide by the agreement reached by the three parties, but in practice, the air force has never obeyed. A representative of the Executive Headquarters said: The most obvious and notorious example of the government air force violating the truce agreement is the Yongnian incident... The Communist army agreed to let the Kuomintang army (i.e., the puppet army incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek) withdraw from the city according to the order of the Executive Headquarters. When the withdrawal began, government planes strafed the Communist army, resulting in the withdrawal agreement being revoked. Chiang's planes have violated the truce agreement by bombing more than once, but the U.S. side has never protested until its own personnel were injured. The Chinese Communist side has repeatedly proposed that the air force should be controlled by the Executive Headquarters and should not participate in the civil war, but the U.S. side has always insisted on dissenting. As for material assistance to Chiang, the U.S. side has not only not stopped it, but has also signed a new agreement with Chiang's side. People here generally feel that if the U.S. authorities continue to do so, then even if the U.S. side protests the bombing of the Chengde Group, it will inevitably give people the impression that the U.S. authorities only protest when their own personnel are injured, and tacitly approve the brutality of Chiang's planes in harming Chinese Communist personnel and peaceful Chinese residents, which is actually tantamount to supporting it. If the U.S. side truly wants to stop Chiang's plane atrocities and desires peace in China, then there is no other way but to agree to the Chinese Communist side's proposal to control the air force by the Executive Headquarters and immediately stop aid to Chiang.

　　蒋机轰炸承德小组
    和平人士均表义愤
    传执行部美方亦将向蒋抗议
    【新华社延安九日电】蒋介石飞机轰炸承德执行小组一事，已引起和平人士的义愤。据传北平执行部美方代表亦不得不指责蒋机的暴行。据美联社北平七日电：“执行组消息灵通人士称：预料美国官员……将向蒋介石提出严重强烈的抗议。”该人士并称：在理论上空军应遵守三方所达成之协议，但实际上空军从未服从过。执行部之代表称：政府空军破坏停战协定的最大罪恶昭彰的影子，就是永年事件………中共军同意根据执行部命令让国民党军（按即蒋介石收编之伪军）撤离该城，当开始撤退时，政府飞机扫射共军，结果又撤回协议。按蒋机违反停战协定的轰炸行为，已非一次，而其美方在其自己人员受损伤以前，从未提出抗议。空军归执行部控制，不得参加内战之议，中共方面曾屡次提出，但美方始终坚持异议。至于对蒋物资接济方面，美方不仅没有停止，并已与蒋方订立新约，此间一般人士感到如果美当局继续这样做去，那末即使美方对承德小组轰炸事件提出抗议，亦不免予人这样一个印象：美当局只有当自己人员受损时才抗议一下，而对于蒋机残害中共方面人员及中国和平居民的暴行则予以默许，实际上等于赞助。美方如真欲停止蒋机暴行，有意欲使中国和平，则除同意中共方面的由执行部控制空军与立即停止援蒋之建议以外别无他途。
