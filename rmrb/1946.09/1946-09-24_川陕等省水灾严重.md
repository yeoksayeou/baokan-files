Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Following droughts, winds, locusts, insects, and epidemics, the Kuomintang-controlled areas have suffered from floods and hailstorms since the beginning of autumn. Reported disasters include those in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and western Liaoning. According to incomplete data, more than 150 counties have been affected. The floods in Sichuan and Shaanxi, each affecting 40 counties, are the most severe. Western Yunnan and western Liaoning are newly affected areas. The disaster in the Liao River has caused suffering for 200,000 people. The victims in western Yunnan number over 300,000, with 77% of the area from the Lancang River in the east to the national border in the west being disaster areas. In the affluent areas around the Kuomintang capital, such as Taihu Lake, along the lakes, and Changdang Lake, the people along the Huai River in northern Anhui are another severely affected area, suffering from a combination of water, locust, and insect plagues. In the Dongting Lake area south of Micang Mountain, 4 million people have already starved to death, but the Minister of Food, Xu Kan, and the Kuomintang propaganda organs are constantly touting "bumper harvests," using this as an excuse to extort over 100 million piculs of grain from the people. The collection of land taxes has already begun in various provinces in July and August.

　　川陕等省水灾严重
    【新华社延安廿一日电】蒋介石统治区继旱、风、蝗、虫、疫等灾之后，入秋以来，又复遭水雹等灾。已见报灾者，有浙、苏、皖北、川、滇、陕、甘及辽西等地。据不完全材料，受灾县份达一百五十县以上。川陕水灾各达四十县，最为严重。滇西、辽西为新的受灾区域，辽河之灾，使二十万人民受难。滇西的受难者，则达三十余万，东起澜沧江，西至国界，百分之七十七均系灾区。在国民党首都周围的太湖、沿＠湖、长荡湖等富饶区，皖北淮河沿岸人民在水、蝗、虫灾交袭之下，为另一严重灾区。而米仓湖南的滨湖（洞庭）地区，人民饿死者已达四百万，但粮食部长徐堪及国民党宣传机关却不断高唱“丰收”，以此为借口，向人民索取一万万石以上的粮食。田赋征实在各省均已先后于七八月间开征。
