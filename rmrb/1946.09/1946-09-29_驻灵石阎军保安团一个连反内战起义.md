Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 26th: Lüliang News: The entire officers and soldiers of the 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, 16th Regiment of the Yan Department's Security Regiment stationed in Lingshi, led by Captain Zhao Mingsheng and Lieutenant Guo Zhizhong, staged an anti-civil war uprising on the 15th of this month and have now arrived in the Lingshi Liberated Area. Lieutenant Guo Zhizhong described the reasons for the uprising, saying, "We witnessed Yan Xishan's 'integration of soldiers and farmers' and land distribution by groups, which caused the people to suffer unspeakably. Although I am an officer in Yan's army, my family life is not guaranteed at all. One hundred and sixty mu of land, one mule, one horse, and more than sixty sheep were all 'integrated' cleanly." Then, he said with righteous indignation, "Yan Xishan is carrying out the purge of 'disguised' elements, creating terror within the army. Captain Zhao and I were monitored because we were unwilling to kill our own compatriots. Now we are willing to join hands with the Eighth Route Army to fight together and protect the interests of the masses."

　　驻灵石阎军保安团一个连反内战起义
    【新华社兴县二十六日电】吕梁讯：阎部驻灵石保安团第十六团二营六连全体官兵，在上尉连长赵明生、中尉排长郭智中率领下，于本月十五日举行反内战起义，现已到达灵石解放区。郭智中排长叙述起义原因说：“我们目睹阎锡山的‘兵农合一’按组分地，害得人民叫苦连天，我虽为阎军的军官，家庭生活一点也得不到保障，一百六十亩土地，骡马各一匹，绵羊六十余只，都被‘合’得干干净净。”接着，他又义愤的说：“阎锡山进行肃清‘伪装’分子，造成军队内部的恐怖，我和赵连长因为不愿意残杀自己同胞，曾被监视过，现愿与八路军携手共同战斗，保护群众利益。”
