[Dispatch from our newspaper in Heze, 5th] The Field Health Department, to guarantee the victory of the patriotic war on the front lines and to crush Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous plot of a civil war, calls on all staff to intensify their work, care for the wounded, and strive for 90% of the wounded not to fester and 50% to return to duty within one month. This has created a highly intense work upsurge in the field health work. From the 12th to the 23rd of last month, the field hospital received over x hundred wounded soldiers. Despite constant attacks and strafing by Kuomintang planes, all personnel persisted in their work, day and night. Minister Qian of the Field Health Department, Director Zhou, and Section Chief Yang personally performed surgery on seriously wounded soldiers. Minister Qian's legs were swollen, but he remained energetic and tireless, performing surgery on more than fifty seriously injured comrades in one day and one night. Many comrades volunteered to donate blood for the wounded soldiers. Comrade Wang Zhengming, a nursing soldier from the First Unit, and Comrade Lü Jizhou, a student from the Third Middle School, donated 100 cc of blood. Zhao Huanwen, a student from the Medical College of Northern University, signed up to donate one pound of blood for the wounded soldiers. A female student from the Third Middle School wanted to donate blood for the wounded soldiers, but was not permitted by the doctor due to health problems. More than half of the medical personnel in the Third Unit worked while ill. Many doctors immediately changed dressings for the wounded after having malaria. The director of the Fourth Unit had not slept for at least five days out of ten. Messengers delivered letters every day and stood guard at night. Cooks cooked water in heavy rain and mud and cooked meals for the wounded. The mood is even higher. Students from the Third Middle School in Dingtao took care of the wounded, wrapping them, feeding them, and washing bloody cloths, staying in the wards day and night. As for the care of the wounded by the common people, it is also meticulous. The masses put quilts on the stretchers, and even if they were strafed by planes, they never left the wounded. A stretcher team in a certain village encountered rain on the way, and the people voluntarily took off their clothes to shelter the wounded from the rain. Due to the reform of treatment methods in the hospital, only eight out of one hundred and eighty people in a certain unit festered. Generally, the wounded can recover without changing dressings. It is estimated that within one month, one-half of the four hundred wounded in the entire hospital can be organized to return to duty.

    野战卫生部紧张工作         
    同志们争先输血支援自卫战
    钱部长站肿双腿日夜施手术
    【本报荷泽五日电】野战卫生部，为保证前线爱国战争的胜利，粉碎蒋介石卖国内战阴谋，号召全体工作人员加紧工作，爱护伤兵，争取百分之九十的伤兵不化脓，一月之内归队百分之五十，在野战卫生工作中造成了高度紧张的工作热潮，上月十二日到二十三日，野战医院即收到伤兵×百余名，虽在国民党飞机不断袭击扫射之下，全体人员坚持工作，日夜不休。野战卫生部钱部长，周主任，杨处长均亲手为重伤兵施行手术，钱部长站的两腿发肿，但仍精神焕发，毫无倦容，在一日一夜中为五十多个重彩号全部开刀，施行手术，不少同志自动为伤兵输血，一所看护兵王正明同志，三中学生吕继周同志输血达一百“ＣＣ”，北方大学医学院学生赵焕文同志，报名愿为伤兵输血一磅，三中一个女生愿为伤兵输血，因身体有病，未为医生许可。三中队半数以上医务人员带病工作，不少医生刚发过疟子即马上为伤员换药，四所所长十天里面至少有五天没有睡过觉，通讯员每天送信，晚上放哨，炊事员在大雨泥泞中，烧着水，为伤员做饭，情绪更为高涨。定陶三中学生，在照顾伤员上，为伤员包裹、喂饭、洗血布，日夜不离病房。至于老百姓对伤员的爱护亦无微不至，群众在担架上垫上被子，有时虽遭到飞机扫射，但绝不离开伤员，某村担架队中途遇雨，老百姓自动脱光衣服为伤员遮雨。由于医院在治疗方法上的改革，某所一百八十人中只有八个化脓的，一般伤员，不需换药即可痊愈。占计一月内在全院四百名中，可组织二分之一的伤员归队。
