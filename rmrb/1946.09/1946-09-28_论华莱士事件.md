　　On the Wallace Incident

　　In the past month, many important events have occurred in succession, forming the most complex and tense month in the post-war world situation. Among these, one of the most noteworthy events is the Wallace incident in the United States.

　　In his speech in New York on the 12th of this month, Wallace said: "The common people everywhere have never longed for peace as much as they do today, yet they have never feared war as much as they do today." He pointed out that the way to avoid the danger of war is to abolish the United States' "tough policy towards the Soviet Union" and replace it with a policy of "peaceful coexistence between the United States and the Soviet Union." Regarding the situation in China, he advocated a unified and democratic China – built on the basis of cooperation between the various parties in the country and a policy of non-interference by foreign countries. Wallace also disclosed his letter to Truman on July 23, revealing the existence of a military-minded faction within the US government: "One faction of this thinking advocates a 'preventive war,' that is, launching an offensive against the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union possesses the atomic bomb." Wallace's speech and letters touched on the most important issue in the current international situation, which is that since February of this year, the "tough policy towards the Soviet Union" implemented by the American reactionaries, represented by the Leahy, Vandenberg, and Byrnes groups, has formed a serious threat to world peace after the war. Wallace's speech and letters not only reflect the anxiety of the more far-sighted elements of the American bourgeoisie and the broad masses of peace-loving people, but also conform to the sentiments of people all over the world who abhor aggressive war and yearn for lasting peace.

　　Since January, under the control of the reactionaries, what kind of deals have the American authorities recently made in various parts of the world? To name just a few of the most egregious:

　　In China, on August 31, the American authorities sold surplus military supplies worth $825 million to Chiang Kai-shek, shifting from a policy of mediating while aiding Chiang in the civil war to a policy of openly speaking for Chiang and more actively aiding Chiang in the civil war.

　　In Japan, MacArthur issued an anti-Soviet statement on September 2, openly emphasizing Japan's strategic position in a future US-Soviet war, blatantly expressing a policy of preserving Japan's reactionary forces to serve as the United States' watchdog in the East.

　　In Germany, Byrnes, in a speech in Stuttgart on September 6, demanded the immediate establishment of a provisional central government in Germany, exposing a plot to support the remnants of the defeated German fascists.

　　At the Paris Peace Conference, up to the middle of this month, the progress of the conference work was as slow as a snail's pace due to various obstacles from the US side. After seven weeks, only one-third of the draft treaty and one-quarter of the amendments have been discussed. Vandenberg and others are stirring up new disputes in order to create a new crisis at the conference.

　　In the United States, since late August, the reactionaries have been trying their best to spread an atmosphere of anti-democracy, anti-Sovietism, and war. The reactionary newspapers not only slandered the National Citizens Political Action Committee and the American Communist Party in every possible way, but also tried their best to smear the democratic forces in China, the democratic government of Yugoslavia, and other democratic countries and parties in Europe. The new American warlords, one after another, made a great show of preparing for war, announcing that they would not withdraw troops from China, plans for military exercises in the Arctic and Alaska, and peacetime arms preparation plans, and so on.

　　All of this cannot but arouse unprecedented and widespread anxiety and opposition among the American people. Precisely because of this, Wallace's speech immediately shook the country, causing a crisis in the Truman cabinet. Truman had twice attempted to reach a compromise with Wallace in order to continue implementing the Leahy-Vandenberg-Byrnes "tough policy towards the Soviet Union" on the one hand, and to keep Wallace in the cabinet as an ornament on the other. However, the conflict between Wallace's peace policy and Byrnes' "tough policy towards the Soviet Union" had already surfaced. The military-minded faction and the reactionaries feared that Wallace's continued tenure would become a serious obstacle to their policies, and therefore had no choice but to push Wallace out of the cabinet.

　　In the Wallace incident, the reactionaries seemed to have won a "victory," but this "victory" is temporary and superficial. This "victory" is precisely the beginning of the reactionaries' sorrow. The reactionaries expelled Wallace from the cabinet alone, but they taught the American people a lesson, making them more aware and united to work for the defense of peace and against war. This incident made the American people realize that under the control of the reactionaries, the Truman government had betrayed Roosevelt's policies, swept away the remnants of the "New Deal," and purged the old "New Deal" personnel, making the American people realize that the current foreign policy of the US government is following the dictates of the big financial groups and new warlords, attempting to dominate the world, and pushing the United States into a criminal policy of war. This incident also taught Wallace a lesson; Wallace, in order to fight against the "military-minded faction," must rely more on the American people and the American democrats. The Wallace incident clearly demonstrates that there are two different paths in the United States today: the people want to take the path of peace, while the new and old warlords – the "military-minded faction" – want to take the path of war. And the current US government is increasingly becoming a tool of the "military-minded faction." However, the American "military-minded faction" and the reactionaries are a very small minority, and are outwardly strong but inwardly weak; while the American people and the American democrats contain invincible great strength. After Wallace left office, his declaration to resolutely fight for peace immediately received a response from peace groups and people from all walks of life, and the American Railway Workers Union even announced its support for Wallace as a candidate for the next presidential election. After this, the unified front movement of the American people and democrats to strive for peace, no matter how many serious difficulties still lie ahead, its future is extremely broad, it will gradually eliminate various obstacles, and achieve unprecedented development. This movement, in coordination with the worldwide people's wave of anger against the expansionist policies of American imperialism, has the power to defend peace and defeat the conspiracies and plans of the reactionaries to instigate war!

### 论华莱士事件

专栏：解放日报国际述评

　　论华莱士事件
    在过去一个月中，接连发生了许多重要事件，交组成战后世界局势中最复杂紧张的一个月份。这中间最引人注意的事件之一，就是美国的华莱士事件。
    华莱士本月十二日在纽约的演说这样说：“各地普通人民从没有如今日之切望和平，然而他们也从未有如今日之畏惧战争。”他指出避免战争危险的办法，是取消美国的“对苏强硬政策”，而代之以“美苏和平相处”的政策。关于中国局势，他主张一个统一与民主的中国——建筑在该国各党派合作及外国不干涉政策之基础上。华莱士并披露了他七月二十三日致杜鲁门函，揭发了美国政府里面存在着一种军事思想派：“此种思想之一派，主张一种‘预备战争’，即在苏联拥有原子弹之前，以先下手为强向苏联进攻。”华莱士的演说和信件，接触到当前国际局势中最重要的问题，这就是自今年二月以来，美国反动派以李海、范登堡、贝纳斯集团为代表所实行的“对苏强硬政策”，已形成战后世界和平的严重威胁。华莱士的演说和信件，不仅反映美国资产阶级中眼光较远大的分子和广大和平人民的焦虑，而且也符合于全世界人民厌恶侵略战争、渴求持久和平的情绪。
    一月以来，在反动派控制下，美国当局最近在世界各地干了些什么勾当？举其荦荦大者：
    在中国，美国当局于八月三十一日的共值八万万二千五百万美元的剩余军火物资售与蒋介石，从一面调停、一面援蒋内战的政策，走上公开替蒋方说话、更积极地援蒋内战的政策。
    在日本，麦克阿瑟于九月二日发表反苏声明，公然强调日本在未来美苏战争中的战略地位，露骨的表示保存日本反动势力，以作为美国在东方的警犬的政策。
    在德国，贝纳斯于九月六日在斯图加特演说，要求立即成立德国临时中央政府，暴露了扶植被打败的德国法西斯残余势力的图谋。
    在巴黎和会上，迄本月中旬止，由于美方的多方阻挠，和会工作的进展象蜗牛爬行一样。经过了七个星期，仅仅讨论了和约草案的三分之一、修正案的四分之一。范登堡等正在挑起新的纠纷，以便造成和会新的危机。
    在美国国内，反动派从八月下旬以来，竭力散布反民主、反苏以及战争的空气，反动报纸不仅百端毁谤美国全国公民政治行动委员会和美共等，而且也尽力污蔑中国民主势力、南斯拉夫民主政府以及欧洲其他民主国家和党派。美国的新军阀们，一个继一个的大放备战厥词，宣布不从中国撤兵、北极以及阿拉斯加的军事演习计划和平时军火准备计划等等。
    所有这些，不能不引起美国人民空前普遍的焦虑和反对。正因为如此，华莱士演说马上震动了全国，使杜鲁门内阁发生危机。杜鲁门曾经两度企图与华莱士取得妥协，以便一方面继续执行李海——范登堡——贝纳斯的“对苏强硬政策”，另方面把华莱士留在内阁里面作为装饰。但是华莱士和平政策与贝纳斯“对苏强硬政策”的冲突已经表面化了，军事思想派和反动派惧怕华莱士的继续留任将成为他们的政策的严重障碍，因而不能不把华莱士排挤出内阁之外。
    在华莱士事件中，反动派好像赢得一个“胜利”但是这个“胜利”是暂时和表面的。这个“胜利”正是反动派悲哀的开始。反动派驱逐华莱士一个人出阁，但是却给美国人民上了一课，使他们更加觉醒和团结起来为保卫和平、反对战争而努力。这事件使美国人民认识杜鲁门政府在反动派控制之下，叛逆了罗斯福政策，扫除了“新政”遗规，清洗了“新政”旧人，使美国人民认识美政府当前的外交政策是遵奉着大财阀和新军阀的意旨，妄图独霸世界，把美国推入战争的罪恶政策。这个事件也给华莱士上了一课；华氏要和“军事思想派”作斗争，就不能不多依靠美国人民和美国的民主派。华莱士事件，清楚地表现了在美国今天存在两条不同的道路：人民要走和平的道路，新旧军阀——“军事思想派”则要走战争的道路。而今天的美国政府，正日益成为“军事思想派”的工具。但是，美国的“军事思想派”和反动派是极少数，并且是外强中干的；而美国人民与美国民主派，则蕴藏着不可战胜的伟大力量。华莱士去职后，坚决为和平奋斗的宣言，立即获得各界和平团体和人士的响应，美国铁路工会且宣布拥护华莱士为下届总统候选人。此后，美国人民与民主派争取和平的统一战线运动，不管还有许多严重的困难摆在前面，但是它的前途是极其宽广的，它将逐步排除种种障碍，而获得空前的开展。这个运动在全世界各国人民反对美帝国主义扩张政策的怒潮的配合之下，是有力量保卫和平、击败反动派挑动战争的阴谋与计划的！
