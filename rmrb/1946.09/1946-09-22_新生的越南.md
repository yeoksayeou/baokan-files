　　Newborn Vietnam

　　Vietnam is a newborn independent nation completely different from the Philippines. Its independence was not an "endowment" from imperialist countries, but was built by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party through their own strength.

　　Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese People's Government, is the leader of the Vietnamese Communist Party. The Vietnamese People's Government he leads is composed of the Vietnam Independence League led by the Viet Cong, the Vietnam Democratic Party, the Vietnam Revolutionary League, and non-partisan figures. This government controls the three richest of Vietnam's five "邦" (states/regions - not provinces), namely all of Tonkin, Annam, and the vast majority of Cochinchina (rural areas and small and medium-sized cities); the population accounts for about three-quarters of the total population of Vietnam, which is 24 million. Most of the 500,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam live in this area. Most of Vietnam's cities, including the capital Hanoi, are in the hands of the People's Government (French troops are temporarily stationed in some areas), and all railway lines are under their management.

　　As early as when Japan invaded Vietnam in 1940, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, waged a full four years of brutal guerrilla warfare against the Japanese invaders, created vast liberated areas and democratic regimes, and established a liberation army of 300,000 people and a militia force of more than one million people.

　　After Japan surrendered, the French ambitious schemer De Gaulle, like Chiang Kai-shek, ordered the Japanese army not to surrender to the people's army, and even ordered the Japanese army to cooperate with the British and French troops to attack the Liberation Army. However, after several months of fighting, the soldiers and civilians in the Vietnamese liberated areas wiped out all the stubborn Japanese troops and stopped the British and French troops from entering the liberated areas.

　　Under these circumstances, on March 6, the French government and the Vietnamese government signed a ceasefire agreement, agreeing to cease military offensives and recognizing the leadership position of the Ho Chi Minh government and its control over the above-mentioned three "邦" (states/regions), calling them "free "邦" (states/regions)". The status of the other two "邦" (states/regions), Laos and Cambodia, will be decided later. In this way, the struggle of the Vietnamese people achieved an initial victory.

　　However, two months later, in May of this year, a counter-current occurred in the French political situation. The Popular Republican Movement came to power, and the reactionaries wanted to make Vietnam a colony of a small number of French financial groups again. To this end, they violated the ceasefire agreement and resumed military offensives in June, while putting forward harsh proposals to seize the right of self-determination of the Vietnamese people. At this time, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (headed by Nguyen Hai Than) cultivated by Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to accept the惨败 (miserable defeat) in the general election at the beginning of this year, and thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of it, and conspired to cooperate with the French army's offensive in northern Vietnam to overthrow the People's Government. However, the French army's offensives in Hanoi, Haiphong, and the border between Annam and Cochinchina were all blocked by Ho Chi Minh's army, suffering heavy losses, and the Vietnamese Nationalist Party's rebel army was utterly defeated. According to news at the end of August: they have agreed to be incorporated into the government army. This is a major victory for the Vietnamese liberated area soldiers and civilians in their self-defense against the rebels. At the same time, Franco-Vietnamese negotiations were held in France. This negotiation was to resolve the unresolved issue of Vietnamese independence in the March ceasefire agreement. The negotiations only began a month and a half after the Vietnamese delegation led by Ho Chi Minh arrived in France (mid-June). During this period, the French representative—Colonial Minister Moutet (of the Socialist Party)—repeatedly delayed the process, and only reluctantly formed a temporary agreement after the Vietnamese delegation returned home. This on the one hand reflects the unyielding ambitions of a few French colonial pursuers; on the other hand, it shows that the Vietnamese people's strength is strong, making the French side dare not break the agreement rashly.

### 新生的越南

　　新生的越南
    越南是和菲律滨完全不同的一个新生的独立国家。它的独立是帝国主义国家的“恩赐”，而是越南人民在越南共产党领导之下，用自己的力量建立起来的。
    越南人民政府主席胡志明，是越南共产党的领袖，他所领导的越南人民政府，系由越共领导的越南独立同盟、越南民主党、越南革命同盟及无党无派人士组成。这一政府控制了越南五邦中的三个最富庶的邦，就是东京、安南的全部和交趾支那的绝大部（乡村和中小城市）；人口约占全越二千四百万人中的四分之三。越南的五十万华侨，大部就住在这地区。越南的绝大部分城市，包括首都河内，都在人民政府手里（法军暂时驻有一部分），全部铁路线也在他们管理之下。
    远在一九四○年日本侵略越南以后，越南人民就在共产党领导下，对日寇进行了整整四年的残酷的游击战争，创建了广大的解放区和民主政权，建立了拥有三十万人的解放军和百余万人的民兵队伍。
    日本投降后，法国的野心家戴高乐，也曾经和蒋介石一样，命令日军不要向人民的军队缴械，还要日军配合英法军队攻打解放军，但越南解放区军民经过数月奋战，消灭了一切顽抗的日军，又拦住了进入解放区的英法军队。
    在这种情况下，三月六日法政府与越南政府签订了停战协定，答应停止军事进攻，承认胡志明政府及其在上述三邦中的领导地位，称为“自由邦”。另外两邦老挝和柬埔寨的地位，以后再作决定。这样，越南人民的斗争便获得了初步的胜利。
    然而两个月后，今年五月，法国政局发生了逆流，人民共和运动党主政，反动派又想使越南重新成为法国少数财阀的殖民地。为此他们违背停战协定，于六月间恢复军事进攻，同时提出苛刻提案，要制夺越人的自决权。这时蒋介石培养的越南国民党（头子为阮海城）不甘于今年年初大选中的惨败，以为有机可趁，阴谋在越北配合法军的进攻，推翻人民政府。可是法军在河内、海防和安南与交趾支那交界处的进攻，都被胡志明的军队拦住了，损失很大，越南国民党的叛军则被打得落花流水。据八月底的消息说：他们已同意编入政府军中，这是越南解放区军民自卫讨逆战的一大胜利。与此同时，在法国举行了法越谈判，这次谈判是为了解决三月停战协定中未决的越南独立问题。谈判在胡志明率领的越南代表团抵法（六月中旬）后一个半月才开始，其间法方代表——殖民部长蒙幕埃（属社会党）一再拖延，直至越代表团返国后才勉强成立临时协议。这一方面反映法国少数殖民地追求者野心未死；另一方面又表示越南人民力量坚强，使法方不敢冒然破裂。
