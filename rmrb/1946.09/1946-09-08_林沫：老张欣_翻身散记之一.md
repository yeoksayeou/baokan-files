　　(I)
　　I went to Beidongfang, where the Eighth Group was located, to participate in the meeting to struggle against the traitor and local tyrant Zhu Fang. I stayed there for a few days and met an old beggar named Zhang Xin, who was already sixty-three years old. In his past life, apart from being a hired laborer for twenty years, he had been escaping famine and wandering around begging for food. Everyone can imagine what an old beggar looks like: skinny due to hunger and illness, a shriveled face, eyes crusted with discharge, and downcast eyelids unwilling to look at people. But when I saw Zhang Xin, his beard was neatly trimmed, his head freshly shaved, and his face clean, with a reddish glow as if from a fever. People said he seemed to have gone mad during the recent struggles.
　　Early in the morning, just as we got up, old man Zhang Xin came in from outside with two cigarettes and a lit incense stick in his hand. Without saying a word, he handed a cigarette to Old Liu and sat down beside us to smoke. Old Liu said that the old man loved to smoke paper cigarettes and sometimes liked to drink a couple of liang of wine. He turned to the old man and said, "After you've turned over and have your own property, you need to be thrifty, don't you think?" He nodded and said that he wouldn't drink anymore once he felt happy. I thought about something and suddenly felt uncomfortable with Old Liu's words. After a pause, I said to the old man, "Eat and drink well, make up for decades of injustice!" He nodded again, then went to sit in each room before going out. Later, he told me that he was checking to see if there were any changes to the "decision" to execute Zhu Fang.

　　(II)
　　It was a few nights ago during the group's speaking bitterness session. After a woman spoke, he pulled a tattered sack from under his body, and from it, he threw out a small black leather jacket stained with blood and riddled with bullet holes. At first, he was panting and his hands were trembling; but after examining the blood-stained clothes for a moment, he suddenly became calm and resolute. He raised his eyes, widened them (which was very unusual for him), and looked at everyone, saying, "Look at this! Look at the blood on it, these are the clothes my younger brother Zhang Cheng was wearing when he was beaten to death, look at these bullets, they went right through his heart! This was done by the rich and the traitor Zhu Fang! Why did they beat him? Damn them! Because we were poor and couldn't pay the cotton tax, he said something he was unhappy with on the street during the day and was dragged out at night. And my nephew Zhang Hua, because he was fifty yuan short! You all know that he was forced to hang himself from the small willow tree at the door! Tell me, should this revenge be taken?" "It should be taken!!!" This was an unprecedented unanimous roar of hatred from the bottom of their hearts. "That's right! It should be taken." He looked at everyone sternly and said, "Anyone who says it shouldn't be taken, I'll fight them to the death!..."

　　(III)
　　However, Zhang Xin's hatred did not stop there. All six members of his family were forced to death or to flee by the landlords. Later, he often talked to everyone about these things:
　　"My father worked like a beast of burden for the landlord for decades. During famine years, the landlord would drive us away. In the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu, my family of six, carrying the young and pulling the old, fled the famine. It rained heavily, black snow fell! The adults cried from hunger, the children froze into ice, while the landlords sat around the coal fire stewing meat. The bones they left over, they would even feed to their dogs!"
　　"When my father died, he was carried out on a door panel, with his bare feet exposed! Not even a piece of tattered mat."
　　"My mother died in the ancestral hall. When she died, the landlord's family was making dumplings for the New Year; you can't go to people's doors to beg for food on the first day of the New Year! She wanted to drink a sip of hot soup before she died, but she couldn't even get that!"
　　"My second brother was sold to a landlord's family in Lin County as a slave when he was seven years old, and they gave us twelve strings of cash!"
　　"My third brother's name was Zhang Shaoyi. Because he was young, he couldn't work, so he was given away to someone to escape with his life!"
　　"My thirteen-year-old sister was sold to a wealthy family in Pengcheng as a maid! The contract was for twenty strings of cash! Five years later, I begged my way to the door to see her! My sister grabbed me and refused to let go, but she was dragged back by them with kicks and punches! If she hadn't died, she would still be suffering there!..."
　　As for old Zhang Xin himself, he went to Pengcheng, to Lin County, to Tangyin, to Jun County, to Quyang, to Zhumadian in the south,... When he was healthy, he would work for people; but when he got sick, no one cared about him. He often begged for food while sick. When he got old, he thought of his home. Ten years ago, he returned from the outside with a homesick heart...
　　One rainy night, he carried his broken clay pot and a soaking wet tattered quilt, approaching Beidongfang, the village where he was born and raised. But the closer he got to the village, the less he could walk! "Beidongfang, I have no house, no land, nothing at home, what am I going back for? This heavy rain, am I supposed to go to my parents' grave? Am I supposed to go back and be ridiculed by everyone? For decades, I've been a 'dawa' (failure)!" He thought to himself, asking himself, in the rain. In the dark night, he heard the dogs barking in Beidongfang, the village where he was born and raised...
　　He didn't go home. Instead, he went to Shili Pu, not far from his home, where he had worked, begged for food, and become familiar. He lived in the ancestral hall of this village for another ten years, watching his life come to an end. He slept in the ancestral hall at night and asked the gods, "What sin have we poor people committed? We have suffered a lifetime, and we can't even marry a wife and leave descendants?"
　　The gods didn't understand his words, and he had nowhere to tell the grievances of his life...

　　(IV)
　　One winter night two years ago, it was snowing, and he was lying on the offering table sighing. As if in a dream, someone secretly brought him a message: "Your younger brother Zhang Cheng has been shot to death with a black gun!"
　　He struggled, staggered, and trudged through the snow back, secretly dug a pit and buried the body. He took off the blood-stained clothes and ran back to the ancestral hall that night. In the darkness, he knelt there, pointing at the blood-stained clothes and vowing: As long as I don't die, as long as I have a day to stand up, I will take revenge with this!
　　Things were really pressing! Before winter was over, his nephew Zhang Hua hanged himself from the willow tree in front of his house because he couldn't pay the cotton tax! Zhang Xin wrapped up the blood-stained clothes, hid them in a hole in the wall behind the god statue, and returned to bury his last relative.
　　Zhang Xin, oh, after sleeping in the ancestral hall, he often had dreams, dreaming that he was very young, holding a fast gun and fighting the enemy; dreaming that he had two big hands to strangle the necks of all those who oppressed the poor! Later, he went out to beg for food and heard that in the places where the Eighth Route Army had arrived, the poor had turned over, so he looked forward to it every day: Eighth Route Army! Please come quickly!

　　(V)
　　Last year, after the Eighth Route Army liberated Linzhang, old Zhang Xin immediately ran to the district to discuss the poor people turning over. After returning to the village, he secretly colluded and organized a poor people's association of more than one hundred people. But because the landlords threatened and bribed, conspired to sabotage, and divided and bought over the cadres, the turning over was never successful.
　　This year in June, the turning-over work team came to Beidongfang. At first, no matter how they explained to the people, because they were afraid of a change in the weather and of being shot with black guns, they dared not speak of their bitterness.
　　Zhang Xin was the first to voluntarily come forward to speak of his bitterness. After he finished telling his grievances, he also talked in detail about the activities of the landlords in the village, the dynamics of the cadres, and the demands of the masses.
　　Old Liu, who had the most contact with Zhang Xin, told me that he had cried more than twenty times in the recent speaking bitterness movement; but he was definitely not an old man who comforted himself with tears. When I talked to him about his past life, he cried again; but only a fleeting, uncontrollable sob. Then he became angry and resolute; he often even had the impatience and restlessness of a young man; and he hated disunity, baseness, and cowardice the most.
　　It was at a meeting to educate the old cadres that we proposed to everyone: "Farmers all over the world are one family; new and old cadres must unite..." Chen Jinhe, the old militia captain, had been obstructing the masses from turning over. He wanted to object, and he began to say hesitantly, "These words are both right and wrong..." Zhang Xin saw through his intentions, and before he could finish speaking, he jumped up, stomped his feet, and shouted, pounding his chest: "Okay, damn it! You oppose it! You cause yourselves to fight each other! Let the traitor Guo Qing bring back those bad guys! If you don't pay your taxes, you'll hang yourselves, dare you say 'no'? You'll be shot to death with black guns at night! Your children and grandchildren will starve, haven't you tasted enough of starvation? Count it, see if anyone in this room isn't poor, have you all forgotten your roots?" He cried as he spoke, and finally sobbed so hard that he couldn't speak, and ran out of the room, squatting under the window and crying bitterly for a while without restraint.
　　After a brief, heavy silence in the room; people became kind, intimate, clear-headed and resolute! Under a unified will, everyone established the following creed: "The poor do not fight among themselves, do not expose information, do not accept bribes from the wealthy, and discuss everything together." Everyone unanimously swore to this and put their fingerprints on it.

　　(VI)
　　After the traitor Zhu Fang was captured and everyone was called upon to struggle against him, he came to the turning-over work team countless times every day, sometimes coming in a low voice to talk about something; sometimes leading people to speak of their bitterness; sometimes just sitting beside the comrades, squatting here, walking there. He seemed very uneasy, and his heart was heavy. He was worried that the masses would not be able to defeat him. On his face, you never saw a hint of ease or joy.
　　Due to the torment of suffering, his body seemed very old! When he walked, it was as if he had a big stone in his chest, his body swaying unsteadily. Especially when he encountered some difficulties in the struggle, he seemed a little depressed and short of breath.
　　But no matter whether it was a hot noon or a late-night meeting, it was impossible to get him to rest a little longer. He was often seen walking in and out of the doors of various houses. Sometimes, when people gathered on the street to eat, they would suddenly see Zhang Xin again pounding his chest and shouting: "Zhu Fang! Damn you, you forced a life to death for fifty yuan! You spend 250,000 yuan for one visit to the city to prostitute a girl! You old bastard's running dog! You landlord's running dog! You only bite us poor people!" At first, people laughed at him, saying that this old man was a bit crazy - because people didn't dare to speak of their bitterness at home, who would be stupid enough to shout in the street? But slowly, in the meetings and in ordinary conversations, people felt that old Zhang Xin's opinion was correct. The figure of the old beggar who walked down the street with a begging stick, his head down, wiping his eyes, and ignored by everyone, suddenly disappeared among the people! Before their eyes, was a terrible, resolute old man in the struggle, and being with him made it clear that "if the poor don't turn over, it's not like a world."

　　(VII)
　　Before the general meeting, we repeatedly told Zhang Xin not to rush when speaking of his bitterness, and to speak in detail and patiently. But he was ultimately unable to do so. Because of his shouting everywhere in these days, his throat was hoarse as soon as he opened his mouth at the meeting. The more he wanted to speak louder, the less he could say it. People only saw him patting his chest and waving the blood-stained clothes there. Although he didn't speak clearly this time; people from the thirteen villages who participated in the meeting already knew about old Zhang Xin's affairs. And old Zhang Xin, if it hadn't been for so many people actively speaking of their bitterness at the meeting (ninety-eight people spoke of their bitterness, including fourteen cases of people being buried alive, shot with black guns, and forced to death), speaking out the grievances and depression in their hearts, I think the old man would have regretted it forever.
　　When he heard the gunshots of punishment and saw the body of his enemy fall, he slapped my shoulder hard: "It's so satisfying! - I came out before I had breakfast this morning, I want to go back and rest, I want to live a few more years! You go and rest too!" For the first time, I saw a smile suddenly appear on his face, the deeply locked wrinkles and downcast eyelids all loosened up at once; and he seemed to walk much lighter!
　　Now he has obtained seven mu of good irrigated land confiscated from the traitor. The next day, he carried his hoe and went to his own land to cultivate for the first time in his life. The self-defense team children stopped him on the street and asked him: "Old Zhang Xin! You've turned over now, haven't you?" "Hey!" He shook his head and said: "Children, we've only raised our arms now, we'll pull out their roots later!"

### 林沫：老张欣  翻身散记之一

　　林沫：老张欣  翻身散记之一
    （一）
    我到第八组所在地北东坊，去参加斗争汉奸恶霸朱方的大会，在那里住了几天，认识了一个老乞丐，名叫张欣，他已经六十三岁了。在他过去的生活中，除当了二十年雇工之外，就是逃饥荒，到处流浪，要饭。一个老乞丐是什么样子，都会想像得到：因饿、病而骨瘦如柴，脸是干瘪着的，眼角堆着眼屎，低垂着眼帘不愿看人。可是我看见张欣时他却胡子剪得很整齐，新剃的头，脸洁净，像是因发烧而泛着红光，在最近的斗争中，人们说他像是发疯了。
    一大早，我们刚起来，张欣老汉手里拿着两支烟，一根火香，从外面走进来，他没有说什么话，递给老刘一支烟，就坐在我们身旁抽起烟来。老刘说，老汉就爱抽个纸烟，有时还喜欢喝上二两酒。他转过脸去，对老汉说：“以后翻了身啦，自己有了产业，需要俭省，你说是不是？”他点点头，说以后心里畅快了，就不喝酒了。我想到一些什么，对老刘的话突然感到不舒服，停了一下，我对老汉说：“好好吃点喝点吧，补补几十年的冤枉！”他又是点点头，随后到每个房子里坐了一回就出去了。后来他才告诉我，那是来看看枪毙朱方的“决定”有无变化。
    （二）
    那还是前几天夜里在小组诉苦，当一个女人说过之后，他从身子底下拉出一条破口袋，从里面摔出一件染满血迹和穿有弹洞的小黑皮袄，开始他气喘，两手发抖；但是当他把这血衣拿在手里审视了片刻之后，一刹那间他变得镇静而坚决了。他抬起眼帘，睁大着眼（这在他是很不习惯的）望着众人说：“你们都看吧！看这上面的血，这是我弟弟张成被打死时穿的衣服，看这子弹，是从正心上穿过去的呵！这是有钱人和汉奸朱方打的呀！他们为什么打他呢？我日他娘！因为我们穷，交不起棉花钱，白天在街上说了不满意的话，夜里就给拉出去了，还有我的侄子张华，因为差五十块钱交不够呵！您谁都知道，被逼得没办法吊死在门口小柳树上了！你们说吧，这冤仇该不该报？”“该报！！！”这是一声从来所没有的心声一致的仇恨的怒吼。“对啦！该报。”他用严厉的目光望着众人说：“谁要说不该报，我就和他拚！…………。”
    （三）
    然而张欣的仇恨绝不止此，他全家六口人都是叫地主逼得死的死，逃的逃，后来，他常常和众人谈起他这些事情：
    “爹爹给地主作了几十年牛马，到荒旱年地主就把俺们赶走，光绪二十六年俺一家六口，担着小的扯着老的去逃荒，下雷雨，下黑雪呀！大人饿的哭，小孩冻成冰，地主围着煤火炖肉吃，他们吃剩下的骨头呀，还要喂自己的狗！”
    “爹爹死的时候用门板抬出去，露着光脚呀！没有一条破席。”
    “母亲死在祠堂里。死的时候，地主家正在包饺子过年；大年初一不能进人家门去要饭呀！她临死时想喝一口热汤也没有！”
    “二兄弟七岁卖给林县一家地主当奴隶，给了俺十二串钱！”
    “三兄弟名叫张少义，因为年岁小，不能做活，白给了人家去逃活命！”
    “十三岁的妹卖给彭城的大户当丫头！二十串钱立了约！过了五年俺要饭到门上去看她呀！妹妹拉住我死活不放手，被人家连踢带打拉回去了！要是没死她还在那里受折磨！……”
    至于老张欣自己呢，他到彭城，到林县，到汤阴，到浚县，到曲阳，到南边的驻马店，……。他身体好时就给人家去做活，一有病，人家就不管了。他常常在病中去要饭。他老了，他想到自己的家，十年前，他怀着思乡的心情从外边走回来………
    在一个下大雨的晚上，他背着破砂锅和一条湿淋淋的破被子走近生养他的村子北东坊。可是越离村子近，他越走不动了！“北东坊，我一没房子二没地，家里啥都没有，我回去干啥？这大的雨，难道要我到爹娘的坟上去吗？难道我要回去受众人的耻笑吗？几十年来我可是混的“打瓦”“（不成样子）了！”他这样在雨里，自己想着，自己问着。在黑夜里他听到生养自己的北东坊的狗叫。……
    他没有回家，他又到离家不远的，在那里做过活，要过饭，混熟了的十里铺去了。他在这村中的祠堂里又住了十年，眼看自己这一生快要完了，他夜晚睡在祠堂里问神像：“俺穷人有啥罪？俺受了一辈子苦，也不能娶个老婆，留个后代？”
    神像不懂他的话，他一生的冤苦无处诉说。……………
    （四）
    前年冬天一个晚上，天落着雪，他正躺在供桌上叹气。像做梦一样，有人暗暗地给他带了个信：“你的弟弟张成被人用黑枪打死了！”
    他艰难地，跌跌撞撞地踏着雪回去，偷偷地掘个坑把尸身埋了。他揭下了那件血衣，连夜跑回祠堂。在黑暗里他跪在那里指着血衣发誓：只要我不死，只要那一天我有出头的日子，凭着这我要报仇！
    事情逼的真紧呵！冬天还没有过去，他的侄子张华又因缴不起棉花，吊死在家门口柳树上了！张欣把血衣包好，藏在神像后边的墙洞里，又回来埋葬了自己最后的一个亲人。
    张欣呵、以后睡在祠堂时常做梦，梦见自己很年青，拿着快枪和敌人拚；梦见自己长着两只很大的手把所有欺压穷人的脖子扼住！后来他出去要饭，听说八路军到的地方穷人都翻了身，于是他天天盼望着：八路军呵！你快来吧！
    （五）
    去年八路军解放了临漳后，老张欣即跑到区上商量穷人翻身，他回村后曾暗暗串通，组织起一百多人的穷人会。但因为地主威胁利诱阴谋破坏；分化、收买了干部，翻身一直搞不起来。
    今年六月翻身队来到北东坊，开始，无论向老百姓怎么解释，因为怕变天，怕打黑枪，有苦都不敢说。
    张欣第一个自动找来诉苦，他把自己的冤仇说完之后，又把村中地主的活动，干部的动态及群众的要求都详详细细地谈出了。
    和张欣接触最多的老刘告诉我，他在最近的诉苦运动中已经哭了二十多次；但他绝不是个以流泪而自慰的老年人。当我和他谈起他过去的生活时，他又一次的哭了；但只一刹那的抑止不住的抽噎。随即他变为愤怒、坚决；甚至他常常带有青年人的急躁与不安的神色；而且他最仇恨不团结、卑怯、懦弱。
    那是在一次教育旧干部的会议上，我们向大家提出：“天下农民是一家；新旧干部要团结起来………。”旧民兵队长陈金和一直阻碍群众翻身，他想反对，他开始吞吞吐吐的说：“这话又对又不对…………”张欣看透了他的心意，等不得他说完，就急得跳起双脚，拍起胸脯叫喊起来了：“好，我日他娘！你们反对吧！你们闹得自己打起来吧！让汉奸郭清带着那些坏蛋重新回来吧！你们缴不上款就得上吊，你们敢说一个‘不’字？夜里就被黑枪打死！你们的子子孙孙都要受饿，你们还没有尝够挨饿的味道吗？您数一数，看这屋子里那个不是穷人，你们都忘记了自己的根子了吗？”他哭着说着，最后抽噎的说不成话，就从屋子里跑出来，蹲在窗下边不加抑止的痛痛的哭了一会。
    屋子里经过短短的沉重的静默之后；人们变得和蔼、亲密，变得清醒而坚决了！众人在统一的意志下立了这样的信条：“穷不自斗，不暴露消息，不受老财的贿赂，有事大家商量。”大家一致对此宣誓并盖了手印。
    （六）
    当汉奸朱方被捉回来，号召大家向他斗争之后，他每天无数次的到翻身队来，有时是低声地来谈些什么；有时是领着人来诉苦；有时是在同志们身边坐坐，这里蹲一蹲，那里走走。他显得十分不安，他心里是沉重的，他担心群众把他斗不倒。在他脸上，你从来看不到一点轻松或喜悦的神色。
    由于苦难的折磨，他的身躯显得很苦老了！他走起路来，好像胸中装着一块大石头，身子摇摆不稳，特别是斗争中遇着什么疑难，他就显得有些郁闷而气喘起来。
    但无论在炎热的中午或深夜开会，要他多休息一会是不成的。时常见他从各家的门里走进走出，有时当人们聚在街上吃饭的时候，会突然看见张欣又拍着胸脯在那里叫喊：“朱方！我日您娘，您五十块钱逼死俺一条人命！你去城里嫖姑娘一回花二十五万！你老日的走狗！你地主的走狗！你专咬俺们穷人哪！……”开始人们都笑他，说这老汉有些发疯了，——因为人们有苦在家还不敢诉，有谁傻得来在大街上叫喊呢？但是慢慢地，在会议上，在平常的谈话中，人们都觉得老张欣的意见是对的。那个拿着要饭棍，低着头，搭抹着眼，从街上走过而无人理睬的老乞丐的身影，在人们中间突然消失了！眼前，是一个可怕的斗争坚决的老人，和他在一起就清楚的觉得“穷人不翻身就不像个世界”。
    （七）
    开大会之前，我们曾再三告诉张欣，到诉苦的时候千万不要着急，要他详细地耐心地讲。但是他毕竟没有能够这样作，由于他这些日子来的到处叫喊，在大会上他一开腔喉咙就嘶哑了，他越想说的声音大，越说不出来，人们只见他拍自己的胸脯，只见他拿着血衣在那里招示。他这次虽然没有讲清楚；但参加大会的十三个村子的人都已经知道老张欣的事情了。而老张欣，要不是大会上诉苦的人那么踊跃（九十八个人诉苦，其中有十四件活埋、黑枪及被逼而死的人命案），诉出了胸中的冤屈和郁闷，我想老头子是要永远后悔的。
    当他听见惩罚的枪声和看见仇人的尸身倒下时，他用力拍打着我的肩膀：“真痛快呀！——我早晨还没有吃饭就出来了，我要回去歇一下，我可要再好好多活几年啦！你也去休息一下吧！”我第一次看见，他脸上突然露出笑容，深锁着的满脸皱纹和低垂着的眼帘都一下松开了；走起路来也像是轻快的多了！
    现在他已经得到没收汉奸的七亩好水地，第二天，他就扛着锄头，平生第一次走到自己的土地上去耕作了。自卫队的孩子们，在街上拦住问他：“老张欣！你这可算翻了身啦吧？”“嘿！”他摇着头说：“孩子，咱们这才抬起了膀子，以后就要拔他们的根咧！”
                                      四六、八、十二于临漳
