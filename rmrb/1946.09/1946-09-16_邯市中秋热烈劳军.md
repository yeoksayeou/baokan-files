Handan Enthusiastically Celebrates Mid-Autumn Festival with Troops
[This newspaper's Handan 10th dispatch] Under the call of the Patriotic Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee in the city, the citizens enthusiastically celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival with the troops. The citizens said: "The Eighth Route Army is on the front line, working hard to win battles. We must let them have a good Mid-Autumn Festival." The day before Mid-Autumn Festival, the public stadium was crowded with representatives and citizens sending gifts of comfort. Twenty-two Yangko teams composed of various schools and citizens were spread throughout the streets, performing various stories. Each Yangko team carried portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on high poles, as well as colorful slogans, which read "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous head of the traitorous gang, from attacking the liberated areas!" "Please government bring our hearts to the front!" "Respectfully wish Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng good health!" At about 10 o'clock, representatives from Sandi Village in Zhangzhuangqiao District, eight miles away from the city, also rushed to the scene. Mayor Wang gave a brief speech, and then the team lined up to present the gifts of comfort. The line, which stretched for two miles, shouted slogans against the civil war, passed through Hanshan Road, Xinhua Street, and Heping Avenue, and went directly to the military region's organs.

　　邯市中秋热烈劳军
    【本报邯郸十日电】在本市爱国自卫战争动员委员会号召下，市民群众在中秋节热烈劳军。市民们说：“八路军在前线，辛辛苦苦打胜仗，我们一定要让他们好好过个中秋节。”中秋前一日，公共体育场上挤满送慰劳品的代表和市民。各学校及市民们组成的二十二个秧歌队布满各街，扮演各种故事。每个秧歌队前都用高杆举着毛主席、朱总司令的肖像及彩色标语，标语大书“反对汉奸卖国贼头子蒋介石进攻解放区！”“请政府把我们的心带到前线去！”“敬祝刘司令员、邓政委身体健康”！十时许，离城八里的张庄桥区三堤村的代表也匆忙赶到，王市长作了简短的演说，随即列队献送慰劳品。二里长的行列高呼着反对内战的口号，穿过邯山路、新华街以及和平大街，直达军区机关驻地。
