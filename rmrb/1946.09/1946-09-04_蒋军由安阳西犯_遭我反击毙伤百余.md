　　Chiang's Troops Invade West from Anyang
    Suffering Over 100 Casualties in Our Counterattack
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 31st] Chiang's troops, invading west from Anyang, northern Henan, on the 24th, are still being blocked in the Qugouzhen area, 20 miles east of Shuiye. It has now been determined that the commander-in-chief of this invading Chiang army is Si Yuankai, brigade commander of the 29th Brigade of the 40th Division, with a total force of 3,000 men (including the 317th and 318th Regiments of the 106th Brigade, the Security Regiment of the Third Special District Office of northern Henan under the Kuomintang, and a part of the "Homecoming Corps"). Wherever the Chiang and puppet troops go, they wantonly arrest and kill the family members of our anti-Japanese soldiers, village cadres, and the masses. The local soldiers and civilians are forced to carry out self-defense counterattacks, and on the dawn of the 26th, they launched a surprise attack on Shijiazhuang near Qugou, killing and wounding over 100 invading Chiang soldiers.
