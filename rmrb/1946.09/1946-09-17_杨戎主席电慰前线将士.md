Chairman Yang Rong Sends a Telegram of Condolence to Frontline Soldiers

To Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, Deputy Commander Teng, Deputy Political Commissar Bo, Deputy Commander Wang, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang, and forwarded to all commanders and fighters on the Longhai and Tongpu Frontlines:

The Kuomintang reactionaries have launched a full-scale civil war. Our Border Region soldiers, in coordination with the operations in the Central Plains and northern Jiangsu, and to strike at the reactionary Chiang troops who attempted to attack northward along the Tongpu Railway, have implemented self-defense, successively capturing Kaifeng, Dangshan, Qi County, Tongxu, Yucheng, and Hongtong, Zhao City, Huo County, and Lingshi, nine cities in total, annihilating more than 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, and controlling more than 500 miles of railway. The war results are brilliant, and the good news has excited the entire region, with cheers everywhere, and intensified work to unanimously support and assist. This government, on behalf of all the people of the Border Region, expresses its congratulations! And attaches 5 million Border Region currency (3.8 million for the Longhai Frontline and 1.2 million for the Tongpu Frontline) to express our condolences!

Yang Xiufeng, Rong Wusheng, Government of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region
