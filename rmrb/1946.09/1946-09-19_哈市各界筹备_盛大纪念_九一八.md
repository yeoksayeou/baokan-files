Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th—All circles in Harbin are currently preparing to hold a grand demonstration parade and propaganda activities on "September 18th." On that day, more than fifty propaganda groups will appear on the streets. Students from various schools will issue a large number of wall posters and hold separate memorial meetings. Student propaganda teams will sing street operas such as "On the Songhua River" and "Put Down Your Whip," arousing memories of the painful life of national subjugation over the past fourteen years. Another propaganda theme of the team is "What is the Second 'September 18th'?", demonstrating the Northeast youth's hatred and vigilance against the collusion between the US and Chiang Kai-shek in attacking the Northeast people.
