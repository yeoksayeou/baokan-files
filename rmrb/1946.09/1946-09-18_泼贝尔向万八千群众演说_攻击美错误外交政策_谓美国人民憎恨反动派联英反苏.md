　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: According to TASS, New York, 14th: A political rally of 18,000 people was held in Madison Square Park under the auspices of the "Independent Citizens Committee of Arts and Sciences" and the "National Citizens Political Action Committee" to campaign for Democratic Senatorial candidate Lehman and New York State gubernatorial candidate Mead. Former US Vice President and current Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace and Democratic Senator Pepper, in their speeches, called for improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and appealed for the restoration of President Roosevelt's foreign policy. Wallace was greeted with enthusiastic applause every time he criticized war instigators and imperialists, but when he spoke certain anti-Soviet remarks, the audience booed loudly. Pepper stated: Truman should immediately convene a special session of Congress to restore price controls, enact housing and anti-lynching legislation, and especially to review America's "erroneous foreign policy." "We don't want those beautifully prepared official speeches explaining our foreign policy; we want action and a confrontation over the behind-the-scenes activities of the big banks and the promises made at the secret meetings in Paris. The people's mood is uneasy; they want to know why American armed forces have now become a symbol of sovereignty and reaction in Europe and Asia, and why American diplomatic authorities ordered the American fleet to risk seriously disrupting peace. People want not only prosperity but also peace." Pepper continued: "We should remember that the last two guys who tried to take a tough line with the Soviet Union—Napoleon and Hitler—didn't succeed." "If the Republican reactionaries gain full power in Congress and the White House, and if we continue to tolerate these elements, it will inevitably lead to a US-Soviet war." "The American people hate being closely allied with Britain against the Soviet Union; the American people want everyone, including us, to withdraw from any country except enemy-occupied territory, and want our government to give the Soviet Union the treatment it deserves. They know that we and Britain have no right to tell the Soviet Union that it has no right to defend the Dardanelles, because the Dardanelles are closer to Soviet territory, just as the Suez is closer to Britain and Panama is closer to the United States. Currently, our country and Britain dominate every ocean, dominate every strategic area on earth surrounding Soviet territory; we cannot expect the Soviet Union, this emerging great power, to accept this situation without protest or hatred." After warning that the world is rapidly changing and that democratic forces are rising everywhere, Pepper called on the US government to restore the Roosevelt tradition and give greater assistance to freedom and independence throughout the world. Famous black singer Robeson, in his speech, praised the Soviet Union's great achievements in human welfare, emphasizing that the Soviet Union has eliminated the oppression of ethnic minorities. He said that the growth of communist forces in France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and China requires the United States to deal with communists wisely and democratically.

　　泼贝尔向万八千群众演说
    攻击美错误外交政策
    谓美国人民憎恨反动派联英反苏
    【新华社延安十五日电】据塔斯社纽约十四日电：在“独立公民艺术科学委员会”及“全国公民政治行动委员会”主持之下，麦迪逊广场公园举行了一个一万八千人的政治集会，为民主党参议员候选人李门及纽约州州长候选人米德竞选。美前副总统现商务部长华莱士及民主党参议员泼贝尔在讲演中，要求改善苏美之间的关系，并吁请恢复罗斯福总统的外交政策。华莱士每讲至斥责战争挑拨者及帝国主义之处，听众即报以热烈的掌声，但在他讲到某些反对苏联的语句时，听众即高声嗤之。泼贝尔称：杜鲁门应当立即召集国会特别会议，以恢复物价管制，制定住宅及禁止私刑之立法，尤其是检讨美“错误的外交政策”。“我们不要那些准备得很漂亮的解释我们外交政策的官方演说词，我们要的是行动和对数十万之大银行之幕后活动及在巴黎秘密会议上之允诺举行对质。人民的情绪是很不安的，他们希望知道为什么现在美国武装部队变成了欧亚两洲主权与反动的表征，为什么美国外交当局命令美国舰队冒破坏和平的严重危险？人民不仅要繁荣，而且也要和平”。泼贝尔继称：“我们应当记得，企图对苏采取强硬政策的最后两个家伙——拿破仑与希特勒，并未得售其技”“如果共和党反动派在国会与白宫中握得了全权，如果我们继续宽容这些分子，这将不可避免地带来美苏战争。”“美国人民憎恨与英国密切联合起来反对苏联，美国人民希望每个人包括我们在内退出除了敌人被占领领土之外的任何国家，并希望我们的政府给苏联以应得之待遇，他们知道我们和英国无权告诉苏联说它无权防卫达达尼尔，因为达达尼尔距苏联领土更近，一如苏彝士对英国、巴拿马对美国更近一样。目前我国与英国统治着每个海洋，统治着环绕苏联领土的地球上的每个战略地区，我们不能期望苏联这个新兴的大国会在不抗议不憎恨情况之下接受这种情况。”泼贝尔在警告世界正在迅速地改变着、各地民主力量正在抬头之后，要求美国政府恢复罗斯福的传统，予全世界自由及独立以更大的臂助。著名黑人歌王罗伯逊在其演说中颂扬苏联在人类福利方面的伟大成就，强调苏联消除了对少数民族的压迫。他说共产党力量在法国、捷克、南斯拉夫及中国之增长，要求美国明哲地、民主地和共产党办事。
