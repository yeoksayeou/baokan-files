　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: New York dispatch: Mrs. Roosevelt, at the New York State Democratic Party Congress on the 4th, attacked the current New York State Governor, Republican Dewey, accusing him of attempting to use the housing shortage as a political weapon and refusing to build houses for veterans. At the same time, the Republican and Labor parties of New York State also held conferences respectively. The purpose of the three parties' conferences was to elect candidates for the New York State Governor and Senator in the November election this year. It is generally estimated that the Democratic Party will nominate current Senator Mead as a candidate for Governor, and former Governor and former UNRRA Director Lehman as a candidate for Senator; the Republican Party will propose Dewey for re-election as Governor, and Coias as a candidate for Senator; the Labor Party will support the Democratic Party to打击(dǎ jī: strike/hit/attack/crackdown on) Dewey. All parties are paying close attention to the results of the three parties' conferences, because New York State occupies a pivotal position in American politics, and the New York State Governor is often a presidential candidate of each party, and the members of Congress also have a significant impact in Congress.

　　罗斯福夫人谴责杜威
    【新华社延安六日电】纽约讯：罗斯福夫人于四日纽约州民主党大会上，攻击现纽约州长共和党人杜威，斥责他企图利用房荒作为政治武器，不给退伍军人建造住宅。同时纽约州的共和党和劳工党亦分别举行大会，三党的大会的目的为推选今年十一月大选中的纽约州长及参议员的候选人。据一般估计，民主党将推现任参议员米德为州长候选人，前州长及前联总署长李门为参议员候选人；共和党将提出杜威连任州长，并以高亚斯为参议员候选人；劳工党将支持民主党，以打击杜威。各方咸注意三党大会的结果，因纽约州在美国政治中占枢纽地位，且纽约州长常为各党之总统候选人，议员在国会中亦有重大影响。
