　　"I Never Want to Go Back!"
　　The Autobiography of Kuomintang Soldier Lei Yingwu, Who Laid Down His Arms for the Second Time
    My name is Lei Yingwu, I am twenty-five years old this year, and I live in Nanji Gou, Xiaolu Mountain, Peng'an County, Shunqing Prefecture, Sichuan. We have a conscription system there, which is actually just grabbing young men. If you have money, you only need to spend some with the Ba長 (local headman), and no matter how many brothers you have, you can avoid disaster. Poor people have no choice but to be forced into the army. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), I was going to be conscripted, but after many people interceded, I was not drafted, but I had to work for the Ba長 for a full year, which exhausted me. At the end of the year, the Ba長 only gave me forty yuan. The following year, I said I didn't want to work for the Ba長 anymore, so he called out for conscription. I fled more than 120 li from home to work elsewhere, but the Ba長 arrested my father and押 (mortgaged) him at the township office, insisting that I go back. I had no choice but to return and become a soldier. This was in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) when I was conscripted into the Second Company, First Battalion, 199th Regiment, 67th Division, 86th Army.

    After becoming a soldier, I went to the north of Hankou, Hubei to suppress "bandits" twice. Those bandits had machine guns and cannons. After Japan surrendered, we were transferred to the 30th Army in Yichang, Hubei, and from there we set off north, saying we were going to take over the Japanese guns. Along the way, the officers kept telling us to be careful because bandits were causing trouble on the road. Last October, when we reached the Cixian area, fighting suddenly broke out in front. At first, everyone thought we had encountered bandits, so we resisted desperately. But later, we heard the shouts of the Eighth Route Army comrades and realized that the fighting was not with bandits but with the meritorious Eighth Route Army who fought against Japan. So we surrendered our guns. After surrendering, we came to the Eighth Route Army and what we heard and saw was completely different from the past. In their army, soldiers didn't dare to speak to officers. If a soldier was sitting and saw an officer coming, he had to stand at attention. If he was a little slow, he would get slapped. Every morning, the squad leader would tell the soldiers to fetch him water to wash his face and serve him food. If they were a little slow, the squad leader would glare and say, "Why aren't you moving!" Coming to the Eighth Route Army was completely different. Not only did the cadres treat the soldiers like brothers, but there was no beating or scolding. Sometimes the squad leader would even fetch water for the comrades to wash their faces. Once, I was sick, and everyone else was eating rice, but they got me noodles to eat. In the Kuomintang army, you couldn't even imagine this. If you were sick, don't even think about getting noodles, no one would even get you congee. The more you couldn't keep up during drills and marching, the more you were beaten. In the Eighth Route Army, soldiers could give the squad leader suggestions if he made a mistake. In the Kuomintang army, this was unheard of. Don't even think about making suggestions, one wrong word and you would be beaten, and they would hold a grudge, who knows when you would be in big trouble!

    Last November, my stomach illness got worse, and the superiors sent me to the hospital. This March, when I came out of the hospital, the superiors said: "Now there is peace, do you want to keep working [in the army]? Or do you want to go home?!" I said: "I want to go home!" The superiors then issued me a pass, a discharge certificate, travel expenses, seventy catties of rice coupons, and a quilt. I was very happy, thinking that this time I could go home and live a peaceful life! But when I was walking south from Linxian, I was stopped by a Kuomintang unit in Shao Village, Anyang. They confiscated my discharge certificate, discharge certificate, pass, seventy catties of rice coupons, and my own blanket and food bag! They kept me as a soldier. I said, "I don't want to be a soldier, I want to go home," and they said, "The 'bandits' haven't been defeated yet, how can you go home!" They forcibly sent me to the Eighth Company, Second Battalion, Second Security Regiment. From then on, my days of suffering began again!!

    This time, the Second Security Regiment was transferred from Shao Village, Anyang to the Yuzhuang area to grab soldiers and grain, and was again rescued by the Eighth Route Army comrades. This time, I want the superiors to find me some work to do locally, farming, doing business, continuing to be a soldier in the Eighth Route Army is also okay; "But I never want to go back again!?"

　　“我再也不愿意回去了！”
　　第二次放下武器的国民党士兵雷应武的自述
    我叫雷应武，今年二十五岁，家住在四川盛顺清府、彭安县、小罗山南极沟，我们那里实行征兵制，实际上就是抓壮丁；有钱的只要向保长花上些钱，不管你弟兄几个都可以免除灾难，穷人就只有被迫当兵。民国三十二年要征我当兵，后来经过很多人说情，总算没有当兵，可是给保长做活就正正的一年，累了个死去活来，到年底保长只给了四十块钱。第二年说不愿意给保长干活了，他便叫出丁当兵，我于是跑出离家一百二十多里地的地方去做活，可是保长却抓走了父亲，押在乡公所，非叫我回去不可，没有了办法，便只有回来当了兵，这是民国三十三年被征入八十六军六十七师一九九团一营二连当兵。
    当兵以后，曾到湖北汉口以北剿过两次“土匪”，那土匪机枪大炮都有。日本投降以后，开到湖北宜昌编入卅军，从此出发便北上说是去接收日本人的枪，一路上，当官的光讲要多加小心，路上有土匪捣乱。去年十月间，走到磁县一带，忽然前边打起来了，开始，大家都以为是遇上土匪，便拚死抵抗，但后来听到八路军同志的喊话，才知道打仗的不是土匪而是抗战有功的八路军，于是便缴了枪。缴枪以后，来到八路军里，听到的看到的和过去完全两样，在那边当兵的不敢给当官的说话，要是当兵的坐着，见了当官的过来还要立正，稍慢一点就是一个耳光，班长每天早起叫当兵的给他打洗脸水，吃饭给他端饭，如果慢一点，班长便瞪着眼说：“为啥不动！”来到八路军里可就完全变了，不但干部待战士亲的像兄弟，不兴打骂，有时候班长还给同志们打洗脸水呢？有一次，我病了，大家都吃米饭，给我弄面条吃。在国民党队伍里，想也想不到这一步，你如果病了，不要说给你弄面条吃，就是连稀饭也没有人给端。出操、走路愈走不动，打的愈厉害。来到八路军里，班长有错，战士可以提意见，在国民党军队里，根本不兴这个，不要说提意见，一句话说错了就是挨揍，记下仇了，说不清啥时候就会倒大霉！
    去年十一月间，我的胃病重了，上级送我去住医院，今年三月间，从医院里出来，上级说：“现在和平了，你愿再干呢？还是愿意回家？！”我说：“愿意回家！”上级便发给我通行证、退伍证、路费、七十斤米票和一条被子，自己满高兴的想，这次可回家去过太平日子吧！可是从林县往南走，走到安阳少村，就叫国民党的队伍查住，把我的出院证、退伍证、通行证、七十斤米票和被子，还有自己的一个毯子和饭包都给没收了！还留我当兵，我说：“我不愿当兵，愿意回家，”他们便说：“现在‘土匪’还没打了，那能回家！”便硬把我送到保安二团二营八连当兵，从此，我受苦的日子就又开始了！！。
    这次保安二团，从安阳少村调到盂庄一带抓兵和抢粮食，又叫八路军同志解救出来，这次我要上级在本地给我找点活做，种地、做生意，继续在八路军里当兵都可以；“但我再也不愿意回去了！？”
