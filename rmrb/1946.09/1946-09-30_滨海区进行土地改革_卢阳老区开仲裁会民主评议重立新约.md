　　Land Reform in the Binhai District
　　Old Revolutionary Base of Luyang Holds Arbitration Meetings for Democratic Assessment and Re-establishment of New Contracts

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 24th] In the Binhai Liberated Area, hundreds of thousands of peasants in the four counties of Ju County, Zhuting (i.e., Ganyu), Rizhao, and Linshu (new county in eastern Linyi) are striving to achieve "land to the tiller." In Zhuting County, after more than 20,000 peasants in over 130 villages successfully reasoned and settled accounts with the local tyrant Cheng Yingdong of Qingkou, 124 villages have completed land reform. It is estimated that 449 peasant households have recovered an average of five mu of cultivated land per household. In older revolutionary base areas such as Luyang, work is being carried out in "blank" villages, with 32 arbitration meetings convened successively. These issues have been resolved through democratic assessment by impartial figures from all social strata, with landlords burning old contracts and advocating for the re-establishment of new contracts. In the new county, 58 out of 64 villages have completed land reform. Linyi, Donghai, and Tancheng counties are also enthusiastically carrying out land reform. During the movement, tenants have made significant concessions to landlords. For example, in Shanzhe River Village in Rizhao, after settling accounts with landlord Zheng Delu, who owed the tenants over one million yuan, he was only charged 200,000 yuan, and he was left with 22 mu of land and all his houses and property to ensure his livelihood. After obtaining land, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has soared. In Zhuting, more than 9,000 men and women have joined mass organizations such as the workers', peasants', youth, and women's associations, and have established sawing teams, cooperatives, and village schools, launching a large-scale production campaign to increase grain production to support the self-defense war. The masses in the border areas are actively expanding their armed forces and resolutely combating the Chiang army's invasions.

　　滨海区进行土地改革
　　卢阳老区开仲裁会民主评议重立新约
    【新华社临沂二十四日电】滨海解放区莒县、竹庭（即赣榆）、日照、临沭（新县临沂东部）四县数十万农民，正为达到耕者有其田而奋斗。竹庭县一百三十余村两万余农民自与青口大地王程应东讲理清算胜利后，有一百二十四个村已完成土地改革。计四四九户农民每户平均收回耕地五亩。卢阳等老地区则开展空白村工作，先后召开仲裁会议卅二次，经各阶层公正人士民主评议得到解决，由地主烧毁旧契，主张重立新约。新县六十四村中，已有五十八村完成土地改革，临沂、东海、郯城等县也正在热烈开展。在运动中佃户对地主让步很大，如日照山子河村地主郑德路清算结果，欠佃户百余万元，仅算二十万元，并给他留下地二十二亩及全部房屋家产以照顾其生活。农民得地后，生产情绪高涨。竹庭有九千余名男女，参加工农青妇等各群众团体，并成立搭锯组，创办合作社与庄户学校，开展大生产增产粮食以支援自卫战，边沿区群众则纷纷扩大武装，积极打击蒋军的进犯。
