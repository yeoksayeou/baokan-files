　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Tokyo dispatch: 500,000 Japanese civil servants have decided to hold a 24-hour general strike on Saturday to protest the government's labor adjustment bill. They have also resolved to send 10,000 people to the parliament to appeal for the prevention of the bill's passage. It is reported that this bill stipulates the abolition of workers' right to strike.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: United Press Tokyo dispatch: On the 27th, 1,500 female employees from seven major train stations in the Tokyo area held a demonstration, departing from Ueno Park's Imperial Art Academy, passing by the Ministry of Railways and the parliament, to oppose the Ministry of Railways' planned large-scale layoffs, especially the layoffs of female employees. The agency also reported that the Japanese Communist Party's influence among railway workers is growing and has taken the lead in the current strike struggle. This is because right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party are carrying out divisive activities to prevent the workers' strike struggle. It is reported that the Japanese government announced last month that it would cut 95,000 railway workers, which greatly shocked the workers. Representatives have been sent to negotiate with the government, and it has been announced that if the government does not cancel the original plan, the railway workers will hold a general strike in mid-September. The current strike is probably only a demonstration.

　　日公务员抗议劳工调整法案
    五十万人定期罢工
    东京铁路女职员千余人示威日共在铁路工人中影响增长
    【新华社延安二十九日电】东京讯：日公务员五十万人决定于星期六举行二十四小时总罢工，抗议政府的劳工调整法案。又决议派一万人赴议会吁请阻止该法案的通过。按该法案规定取缔工人的罢工权利。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】合众社东京电：东京地区七个主要火车站的一千五百个女职员二十七日举行示威，自上野公园帝国艺术院出发，行经铁道省及议会，以反对铁道省所筹划的大批辞退员工，尤其是辞退女职员之举。又据该社报导：日共在铁路工人中的影响增长，并已负起目前罢工斗争中的领导权。因社会党右翼领导分子正进行分裂运动，图阻止工人罢工斗争。按日政府于上月宣布将裁减九万五千铁路工人，工人方面大为震动，已派代表与政府交涉，并宣布政府尚不取消原订计划，则铁路工人将于九月中旬举行大罢工。目前的罢工当仅为示威性质。
