Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 7th: A Hangzhou dispatch reports that recently, groups of American soldiers, numbering thirty to forty each, have appeared on the shores of West Lake. Among them are female nurses in strange attire and heavy makeup. They reside in the luxurious Xileng Hotel, and the authorities have assigned translators to specifically attend to them. During the day, they dash around the streets or go boating and swimming in West Lake. On clear, moonlit nights, the quiet West Lake is filled with the noisy songs of foreigners. The songs are full of homesickness, and they tell people that they have been stationed in China for too long and have not heard from their families back home for a long time, and they don't know if their wives and lovers are still safe. Note: American soldiers began to go to Hangzhou in batches for "sightseeing" in the spring of this year.

　　娴静的西子湖畔
    平添了异国离愁
    【新华社延安七日电】杭州讯：西子湖畔近来也出现成批美军，每批三四十人，其中夹杂奇装浓抹的女护士，他们住在华贵的西冷饭店，当局派有翻译官专门侍候他们。白天他们在街上横冲直撞，或到西湖划船游泳；风清月夜，寂静的西湖上，平添了噪人的异国歌声，歌声里充满着怀乡情绪，他们对人说到中国驻得太长久了，家乡很久没有音信，都不知道妻子爱人还安全不。按：美军分批赴杭“游览”，开始在今年春天。
