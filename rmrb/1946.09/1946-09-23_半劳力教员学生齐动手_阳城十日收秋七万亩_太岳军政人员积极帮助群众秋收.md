　　Semi-Labor Teachers and Students Work Together
    Yangcheng Harvests 70,000 Mu in Ten Days
    Taiyue Military and Government Personnel Actively Help the Masses with Autumn Harvest
    [Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng on the 18th] The entire county of Yangcheng is mobilizing all labor to begin the autumn harvest. In less than ten days, eight-tenths of the county's 190,000 mu of millet has already been harvested. When Chiang's troops attacked the Jin-nan liberated area, the majority of the county's able-bodied men and youth automatically surged to the self-defense battlefield to support the Eighth Route Army in combat. The rear organized semi-labor forces to join mutual aid teams to compensate for the labor shortage. All 500 primary schools in the county closed for a holiday to participate in the autumn harvest. 20,000 primary school students assisted their families with the autumn harvest, mostly led by faculty and staff, divided into several groups, first harvesting for military families and the families of those who went to the front. The autumn harvest groups from Gulong Village, Fuze Village, and Fourth Higher Primary School also conducted field propaganda, opposing Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous civil war and opposing American imperialism's aid to the Kuomintang's civil war. The political awareness of the masses has been further enhanced, and they are all willing to harvest and store early to send to the front. In the above areas, not only was the autumn harvest not affected by the participation of young and middle-aged people in the war, but the time for harvesting millet was shortened by one-third compared to previous years. All the millet was harvested within seven days, and threshing began. Approximately 70,000 semi-laborers participated in the autumn harvest throughout the county, and some areas are already harvesting corn and planting wheat.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Yangcheng on the 19th] Military and government personnel throughout the Taiyue region are promoting their consistent spirit of cherishing the people and actively helping the masses with the autumn harvest. The troops stationed in Nanliu Village in the Seventh District of Yangcheng helped the masses harvest more than 1,400 mu of millet in four days. The troops stationed in Wozhuang Village in the First District helped the masses harvest 285 mu of millet on the 5th and 6th. All the students of the cadre school of the Third Special Commissioner's Office helped the local masses harvest 46 mu of millet on the 15th and 16th. The masses, grateful for the help, prepared wine and meals to comfort them, but they were politely refused.

　　半劳力教员学生齐动手
    阳城十日收秋七万亩
    太岳军政人员积极帮助群众秋收
    【本报阳城十八日电】阳城全县劳力总动员，开始秋收。不到十天，全县十九万亩谷子即已收割十分之八。当蒋军向晋南解放区进攻时该县大部青壮年均自动涌向自卫战场，支援八路军作战；后方乃组织半劳力加入互助组以补劳力之不足，全县五百座小学一齐放假，参加秋收，两万小学生协助家庭秋收，大部由教职员领导，划分若干小组，先为军属及出征参战群众收割。固隆村、府泽村及第四高小学生秋收小组并进行田间宣传，反对蒋介石卖国内战，反对美帝国主义援助国民党内战，群众政治觉悟更加提高，都愿早收早藏到前线去。以上地区非但不因青壮年参战影响秋收，反而割谷时间比往年缩短三分之一，七天内全部谷子已割完，开始碾场打谷。全县参加秋收之半劳力约计七万，部分地区已在收割玉茭播种小麦。
    【本报阳城十九日电】太岳全区军政人员发扬一贯的爱民精神，积极帮助群众秋收。阳城七区南留村驻军四天内帮助群众割谷一千四百余亩，一区卧庄村驻军于五六两日帮助群众割谷二百八十五亩，三专署干校全体学员十五十六两日帮助驻地群众割谷四十六亩。群众感激之余纷纷煮酒备饭慰劳均被婉言拒绝。
