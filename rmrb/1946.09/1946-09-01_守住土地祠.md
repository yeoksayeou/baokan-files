　　Sha and Wu cooperate

　　Guo Zhenlin led his class through the intense gunfire and stopped beside the Land Shrine. The gunfire from Nanguan on the opposite side enveloped the Land Shrine. The dilapidated Land Shrine shook in the barrage, tiles constantly rattling and occasionally falling. Beside the Land Shrine was a two-zhang-long open space. Guo Zhenlin and his ten or so men had the task of digging fortifications in this place and defending the Land Shrine—a key military point.

　　More than ten people pressed their red chests to the ground, laboriously digging the earth with picks. Sometimes, the dirt kicked up by the artillery fire became indistinguishable from the dirt dug out by the picks, scattering and falling again. The men digging the fortifications didn't pay attention to this; they were anxious to complete the fortification in the shortest possible time. Of course, before it was completed, it would be easy for the Yan army to attack and seize this place. Guo Zhenlin dug a few times, then looked to the front and left. There was a road leading directly into Nanguan city, but Guo Zhenlin had already planned to turn these two roads into routes of death for the Yan army.

　　"Clang!" A bullet struck the pickaxe, but the man didn't fall. Guo Zhenlin glanced and continued digging with his head down, the soil jumping out of the fortification and piling up in front of him. The artillery fire from Nanguan on the opposite side now concentrated on exploding around the Land Shrine, seemingly wanting to turn the Land Shrine and the land over completely. But how difficult was this? More than ten people dug as usual, gradually their eyes gleaming, and they gradually sat down.

　　The Land Shrine's fortifications were taking shape. Guo Zhenlin and his comrades laughed happily, vowing to the people: "Resolutely defend the Land Shrine!" The enemy in the city would not allow the Land Shrine to exist, attempting to flatten it with intense artillery fire. But the Land Shrine stood firm, especially the fortifications and people beside the Land Shrine. Thus, the Yan army frantically and desperately ordered an encirclement of the Land Shrine, while also using light machine guns to force soldiers to charge the Land Shrine. Guo Zhenlin and his ten or so comrades could see clearly, quietly passing the word: "Prepare!" About a company of men were coming, already within a hundred meters along the houses, ninety meters, eighty meters... Here it was still quiet, no shots fired. The faces of the ten or so men gradually tightened, showing a blue hue, their eyes burning red.

　　When they were twenty-five meters away from the Land Shrine, Guo Zhenlin and Feng Xiaojian threw grenades, dozens of grenades flying out one after another. With a series of booms, a large cloud of white smoke billowed out, obscuring where the men were running. But faintly heard were shouts, groans, and sounds of fleeing. On the road after the white smoke and dust dissipated, there were several corpses.

　　About ten minutes later, another round of artillery fire came. The Yan army used the artillery fire to cover their advance, moving slowly and cautiously. At this time, someone chuckled quietly, and again at a distance of twenty-five meters, they were hit by a barrage of grenades, adding several more corpses to the road. This time they retreated, daring not to come out again.

　　Guo Zhenlin and his comrades laughed triumphantly and proudly. Some were repairing their fortifications, others were chatting and telling various interesting stories.

　　At dusk, darkness emerged from the ground, from the crops, from the houses, instantly enveloping the Land Shrine and Nanguan. Now it seemed far away from Nanguan, and only a section of the road to Nanguan could be seen in front, the longer and farther places swallowed and blurred by the darkness.

　　Guo Zhenlin was a beacon in this place, illuminating the Land Shrine's position. "Guard this gate, be careful of the Yan army's charge." Someone said, "Hey! Don't be afraid, if we're here, they won't get through!" So they divided the work of watching and sleeping. They slept on the ground fully clothed, holding grenades in their arms.

　　Finally, the Yan army in the city secretly crept over again. Guo Zhenlin pushed the person next to him, and then pushed another. One by one, they climbed onto the fortifications. When the Yan army entered thirty meters away, dozens of grenades were thrown out again, and the men who had crept over retreated hastily. At this time, there was a rough shout: "Charge! Charge! Charge up there!" They pounced over a second time. This time, they had fierce artillery fire for cover. Although they charged to the edge of the Land Shrine, Guo Zhenlin and his comrades calmly threw grenades, and the Yan soldiers fell one by one in the firelight. Those who didn't fall fled.

　　The next day, the Yan army in the city made a fifth and sixth charge. Although Comrade Li Funi gloriously sacrificed himself under the intense artillery fire, and Comrade Feng Xiaojian and others were wounded... Now there were only three of Guo Zhenlin left, but they still had to defend the Land Shrine.

　　The Yan army in the city flew into a rage of incompetence, and ordered all the artillery fire to concentrate on bombarding the Land Shrine. Shells screamed around Guo Zhenlin and his two comrades, completely enveloping the Land Shrine. From afar, it looked like a pile of white smoke, leveling many fortifications. Several times the dirt kicked up by the artillery fire buried Guo Zhenlin, but Guo Zhenlin still defended the Land Shrine, until the main force arrived.

### 守住土地祠

　　守住土地祠
    沙、吾合作
    郭振林领着班里的人，穿过激烈的炮火在土地祠边停下。从对面南关射击来的炮火包围了土地祠，破烂的土地祠在炮火中摇动着，瓦片不时的发出响声，有时落下来。土地祠边有一块两丈长的空地，郭振林十余个人的任务就要在这个地方挖下工事，守住土地祠——这个军事要点。
    十多个人都把红色的胸膛贴到地上，艰难的一镐一镐的挖着泥土。有时，炮火掀起的泥土和洋镐挑出来的泥土分不清的散开去又落下来。挖工事的人并没有注意这一件事，心急的要把这个工事能在极短时间内挖成。当然如果在没有挖成以前，阎军向这里进攻夺取这个地方是很容易的。郭振林挖几下，又照顾着前面左边。这里有路直通南关城内，但是郭振林已经计划着要把两条道路作为阎军通过死亡的道路。
    “当！”一颗枪弹和洋镐碰击着，人没有倒下，郭振林瞧一瞧仍低头挖着，泥土从工事里跳出来又堆积在面前。对面南关的炮火，现在更集中在土地祠周围爆炸，好象要把这土地祠和土地整个翻过来，但这是多么不容易的事情？十多个人照常挖着，渐渐的眼珠闪闪发着光彩，人也渐渐的坐下来。
    土地祠的工事已经做起，郭振林他们愉快地说笑了，他们对人民立誓：“坚决守住土地祠！”城里的敌人决不让土地祠存在，企图依靠激烈的炮火轰平，但土地祠屹立不动，特别是土地祠边的工事和人。于是阎军疯狂绝望的命令围攻土地祠，一面又用轻机关枪逼着士兵向土地祠冲锋。郭振林十多个人看得清楚，悄悄的传着“准备！”过来的约有一营人，沿着房子已经进入一百米，九十米，八十米……这里还是静悄悄的不放枪。十多个人的面色逐渐紧张起来，现着青色眼睛红红的冒出火来。
    当他们离土地祠还有二十五米达时，郭振林、冯小建拿起手榴弹一扔，几十颗手榴弹接连飞出去，轰隆一阵，冒起一大股白烟弥漫开去，看不清人往那里跑，但是隐约听到喊叫声、呻吟声、逃跑声。在白烟尘土消散后的路上，有着几个尸首。
    约摸十来分钟后，又来一阵炮火。阎军借炮火掩护冲过来，进度很慢畏缩地前进。这时有人轻轻笑起来，又在二十五米远的地方，挨了一顿手榴弹路上又增加几个尸首。这回他们退回去了，再也不敢出来了。
    郭振林他们得意而骄傲地笑起来，有的人又修理自己的工事，有的人谈笑起来说着各种的有趣的事情。
    黄昏，黑暗从地底下，从庄稼里，从房屋内冒出来，顿时把土地祠南关包围着。现在好象离开南关不知有多少远，通南关的道路也只能看到面前的一段，更长更远的地方被黑暗吞没着、模糊着。
    郭振林是这个地方的一盏明灯，照明了土地祠的阵地。“把守这个大门，小心阎军的冲锋”。不知是谁在说“喂！不怕，有咱们就没有他们！”于是分工监视睡觉。他们在地上和衣睡下，怀里抱着手榴弹。
    终于城内的阎军又偷偷的摸过来。郭振林推一把旁边的人，又推一把别的人，一个个都爬在工事上。在阎军进入三十米远处的时候，又是几十颗手榴弹抛出去，摸过来的人又急促的退下去。这时有个粗暴的叫声：“冲！冲！冲上去！”他们第二次扑过来。这回有剧烈的炮火掩护，虽然冲到土地祠边，但郭振林他们沉着的扔出手榴弹，在火光下阎军一个个的倒下了，没有倒下的人逃跑了。
    第二天，城内的阎军又作第五次第六次的冲锋。虽然在密集的炮火下李富怩同志光荣牺牲了，冯小建等同志带彩了……。现在剩下郭振林三个人，可是他们还是要守住这个土地祠。
    城内的阎军无能的暴跳起来，又命令所有的炮火集中轰击土地祠。炮弹在郭振林三个人四周叫着。把土地祠整个包起来，远远看去是一堆白烟，把好多工事轰平了。有几次炮火打起的土把郭振林埋起来，可是郭振林仍旧守住了土地祠，直到大部队赶到的时候。
