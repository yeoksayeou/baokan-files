　　On the Writer's Craft

　　--The significance of the work of writers and journalists during wartime--Erenburg said:--Naturally, it is already clear. In this conversation, I want to talk about the writer's craft.

　　We have many young people who aspire to this profession, and often send me their works seeking advice.

　　In the old days, before the revolution, it was extremely difficult and unprofitable to be a writer. At that time, people took the path of literature as if seeking merit, and only those with such a love became writers. But in our time, the writing profession seems to be about seeking an easy life and glory.

　　Beginners in writing always imagine that everything is very simple. The writer collects materials, goes to some front line, takes a look, listens, takes notes, and then comes back, like bringing back a basket of mushrooms from the forest, selects them, and connects what he has recorded--then his novel is considered a great success.

　　A person who has not felt what they write, has not suffered for their work, has not experienced writing, cannot become a writer. Before writing "War and Peace," L. Tolstoy experienced war as a participant in the war, and when he stood on the fortress, he thought not of the novel but of the war.

　　Literature is a heavy labor. When writing about the sacrifice of one of our heroes, the writer deeply feels as if he himself is dying. Anything that the author has not felt or experienced--is inferior, is a clumsy substitute for art and literature. Beginner writers sometimes experience only enough for two pages, and then they consider themselves writers. A terrible misunderstanding is that a writer is like a department store, a writer is someone who writes everything--this is not a writer.

　　Our youth often cannot express their thoughts. Their living language is filled with a fixed news formula, or even some frivolous clichés. One should start learning to speak and write concisely and clearly in school. Obviously, this is a difficult task. Writing fifty lines is much more difficult than writing one hundred and fifty lines. All creative processes--are constant self-compression processes. A certain degree of emotion is necessary. No matter how many times I review my work--I can always find something that can be deleted. Therefore, I advise writers to narrate their thoughts as if sending a telegram, where every word has to be paid for. Young writers pursuing volume is a crime against art and against readers.

　　I have read many novels and sketches by young people, which often make me wonder: why do they write? Where are their thoughts? What does the author want to say? The registration of ordinary facts is unnecessary, this is very obvious. It's okay for couples who meet every day to talk about messy family trivia. However, if they can only meet once a month, they can only talk about the most important things. The writer should see himself as meeting with the reader once, rather than living with them. Therefore, what he has to say should be meaningful and important. Facts and events--are what reveal a conviction and evidence to the writer.

　　Some say that we lack the spirit of diligent study, and it is impossible to have true art.

### 论作家的业务

　　论作家的业务
    ——作家，记者在战时的工作意义，——爱伦堡说：——自然都已明白。在这次谈话中我想讲一讲作家的业务。
    我们有许多青年人渴望着这一行，常常把他们的作品寄给我征求意见。
    在旧时代，在革命以前，做一个作家是极困难而又吃亏的。那时人们走文学之路像是求取功绩，仅仅是有这种爱好的人才成为作家。而在我们这个时代文学的业务却似乎是寻求轻快的生活与光荣。
    初学写作的人总想像一切都很简单，作家搜集材料，到什么前方走一走，看一看，听一听，记一记，然后转回来，像从森林里提出了菌筐子一样，选择一下，把所记下来的联接起来——于是他的小说就算大功告成了。
    一个人，未曾感受过他们所写的东西，未曾痛苦过自己的作品，未曾经验过写作，是不能成为作家。Ｌ·托尔斯泰在写《战争与和平》以前曾经作为一个战争的参加者体验了战争，而当他站在堡垒上的时候，他所想的不是小说而是战争。
    文学是一种沉重的劳动。当写到我们一个英雄牺牲的时候，作家就深深体验到好像自己是正在死去一样。凡是作者所未曾感受过，未曾经验过的，——都是劣等货，都是艺术，文学拙劣的代用品。初学写作者体验的东西有时只够两页，就把自己看成作家了。一种可怕的误解以为作家——是像百货商店一类的东西作家是包写一切的人，——这不是作家。
    我们的青年往往不会表现自己的思想，他们的活生生的语言被一种定型的新闻公式，甚至于是一些浮言滥调所充塞。在学校里应该就开始学会简短明了地说话和写作，显然，这是件难事，写五十行要比写一百五十行难得多的。所有的创造过程——都是不断的自我压缩过程。一定程度的感情是必要的。我无论多少次重复看我的作品，——总能发现，有可以删掉的东西。因此，我劝告写作的人叙述自己的思想要像打电报一样，每一个字都要付钱的。青年作家追求数字，在艺术面前和在读者面前都是一种犯罪。
    我读了青年们许多小说和速写，使我常常发生疑问：他们为什么写？他们的思想在那里？作者想说些什么？平常事实的登记是不必要的，这是很明显的事。在每天见面的夫妇之间，总是谈些乱杂的家庭琐事，那倒还可以。但是，如果他们一个月才能见一次面，他们就只能谈一些最重要的事情了。作家应该把自己看作和读者见一次面，而不是和他们住在一起。因此，他所要说的就应该是有意义的和重要的事情了。事实和事件——就是表露给作家一种确信和凭证。
    有人说我们缺乏钻研精神，是不可能有真正的艺术的。
                                                    刘群译
