　　From Darkness to Light
　　Yan Ling
　　"From South to North, from darkness to light; Goodbye, Chongqing. ......"
　　This is the beginning of a poem written by a young man. He submitted this poem to a supplement of a newspaper in Kaifeng, but it was not published. He felt that he had not written well, carefully revised it several times and sent it again, waiting for many days but still did not see it published. He rewrote it carefully again and sent it again. ... As for the editor, the inner pain deepened with each passing time. It was not that there was anything wrong with the content or technique of the poem, but he never dared to publish it. Working as an editor under long-term dark rule, based on the experience and lessons of endless pain, an invisible "checking standard" had long existed in his heart; he knew how to use words in what kind of situation to give readers a good influence without appearing too "prominent," so as not to be attacked. He also deliberated again and again, and finally, he was moved by the spirit of the young man who wrote the poem, and sent the manuscript to the typesetting room. Still afraid that something would "happen," he temporarily changed some of the more "stimulating" words.
　　However, when he woke up the next morning and took the newspaper, the poem had become: "From North to South, from darkness to light; Goodbye, the Liberated Area. ......" He was so angry that his eyes blazed with fire, he put on his clothes and took the newspaper to question the editor-in-chief. The editor-in-chief said: "I don't know what's going on! It was probably changed by the president of the newspaper." He then went to find the president, who smiled coldly and said: "See if I'm capable? I only changed a few words and completely reversed your meaning! ......" The editor finally left the newspaper.
　　Not arresting the editor immediately was considered "polite" enough in the eyes of the rulers. However, for an upright journalist, such "rape" is more unbearable than arrest or even execution!
　　The Kuomintang reactionaries are the most afraid of freedom of speech in the world. They are afraid of the people turning over, afraid of the people recognizing the true face of the great era, and even more afraid of their own ugliness being exposed in front of the masses. Therefore, they use all kinds of despicable, shameless, cruel and inhumane means to deceive the people's eyes, block the people's ears, and seal the people's mouths, not allowing private newspapers to exist, and not allowing upright journalists freedom. When the International Press Freedom Mission visited Chongqing, the spokesman of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department said: "Our standard of press censorship has been greatly relaxed." However, even the editorial in the Chongqing newspaper "Welcome Press Freedom Envoys" was also censored, only a title was published, leaving a large "skylight." Through this large "skylight," we clearly see the face of Chinese fascism and the picture of people's newspapers suffering under fascist rule. ...
　　When I was in Chongqing, one day I went to Beibei to see a friend, and I happened to encounter such a thing at the bus station: a strong man dragged the newly arrived newspapers off the bus aggressively, grinning and saying: "My winter fur coat is no longer a problem this year!"——Sending this bundle of newspapers back to his boss, he could get a fur coat as a "reward." The newsboys who ran over panting to pick up the newspapers and some people who were eager to buy the newspapers were all stunned on the side, not daring to say a word. However, people were even more eager to read the day's newspaper, knowing that it must have published news that was unfavorable to the rulers.
　　When I was studying at a national university near Chongqing, I, like most of my classmates, loved to read a newspaper that spoke for the people. One day, the newsboy suddenly stopped coming, and the classmates asked each other, but no one knew what was going on. In the evening, I happened to hear a few people talking in a teahouse: "That kid is very stubborn, the three of us tried to deal with him, but he beat each of us several times severely; when we pinned him to the ground, he still kicked and held on to a large roll of newspapers. In the end, he only let go when a gun was pointed at him. That kid! If we have a chance in the future, we must 'fix' him!" The voices were familiar, they were "special students" in our school, and also some active members of the Three People's Principles Youth League. I then knew what had happened to the newsboy we were looking forward to. Afterwards, the newspaper had not been delivered for a long time, and it was rumored that a newsboy had been pushed into the Jialing River while walking along the riverbank. The school authorities later publicly announced that newsboys were no longer allowed to come to the school, the reason being that "things are often lost." At the same time, they also warned the students who subscribed to the newspaper, saying: "You should not read the ×× Daily, people who read the ×× Daily have ideological problems!" Thus, the fox's tail was exposed again.
　　Submitting articles to progressive newspapers often does not get published, and no "cannot be published" notification is received; progressive newspapers often do not reach the readers' hands. Someone once saw a few people near the Chongqing Post Office Administration Bureau working very hard to pour water on a large pile of Sichuan native paper printed matter, and after pouring water, they used large wooden sticks to smash it, turning the pile of things into mud. He curiously asked them what they were doing, and they replied that they were hired to do this specifically. The large pile of printed matter was newspapers that the post office had detained and not sent out. ...
　　The reactionary rulers themselves also know that they are not doing good things, so they detain the newspapers and also try to destroy the evidence. However, the deep scars carved in the hearts of journalists can never be eliminated, and the people will always remember clearly who persecuted them, who did not allow the newspapers that spoke for them and served them to exist. This debt will be settled one day.
　　Last autumn, I left Chongqing and came to the North with the same feeling as the young man who wrote the poem "From South to North ......" What I saw in Xi'an and Kaifeng was a series of atrocities that destroyed and strangled the press. After all, autumn is not spring, even after the Political Consultative Conference resolutions were announced, due to the "stealing the sky and changing the day" by the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek, the spring of peace and democracy still had not arrived. Not long after the Political Consultative Conference closed, the anti-Soviet and anti-communist offensive jointly arranged by the US and Chiang was launched, the Northeast wind blew, and it attacked the people of the whole country with hailstones. In Xi'an, on March 1st, the Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily's sales department in Wuweizazi was destroyed by special agents and thugs; then the reporter Yang was severely beaten by special agents; a slow-acting bomb was secretly placed in the printing room by special agents; the legal counsel Wang Ren was shot by the garrison headquarters under the pretext of being a "smoker," and a large notice was posted at the entrance of the newspaper when he was executed; newsboys were caught and beaten on the street, and newspapers were robbed; stores were threatened not to advertise in the newspaper, and subscribers were threatened not to subscribe to the newspaper, ... ...
　　On the morning of May 11th, I was sitting in the editorial office of a newspaper in a city on the Longhai Railway, pondering facing the continuous drizzle, when suddenly someone told me that a guest had arrived. ... ...
　　This was a friend who had worked at the Qin Feng Industry and Commerce Daily for a long time. I was not surprised by his sudden arrival, because I had seen the news that their newspaper was forced to cease publication in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily a few days ago.
　　He changed his clothes that were soaked all over, and we sat facing each other in silence for a long time. From his mouth, I learned the process of the newspaper being forced to cease publication, and even more learned the tragic news that Li Furen was dragged to the Xianyang Plain and shot ... ...
　　These were all things that happened after the Kuomintang authorities announced the "cancellation of press censorship," a few days after Chiang Kai-shek announced the "four major promises," and also a few days after Chiang Kai-shek flew to Xi'an to deploy the civil war.
　　Not long ago, I had a friend in Kaifeng who was familiar with people in the Henan Provincial Party Department, who told me: "The Central Propaganda Department and the Organization Department have both sent a blacklist, and secretly ordered the local authorities to resolve it on the spot; most of the people on this list are from the cultural and press circles. I don't know who they all are. ......"
　　It was precisely the time when "large-scale household registration inspections" and "joint land and air combat exercises" were being held everywhere, precisely the time when large armies were being transferred eastward and northward on a large scale, precisely the time when trains full of tanks, artillery, and a large number of American-style equipment were heading eastward, precisely the time when various counties were stepping up the collection of military grain, ... ... People understood what this meant. The Kuomintang reactionaries wanted to control public opinion in order to facilitate their insistence on dictatorship and the conduct of civil war. The flames of a larger-scale civil war had already been ignited by the fascist head Chiang Kai-shek, and the persecution of upright journalists would naturally be even more fierce.
　　"From South to North, from darkness to light ......" I finally came to the Liberated Area, and I am in a land of infinite light. I have seen how the people's own newspapers are developing vigorously under the support and guarantee of the Communist Party and the democratic government. For the first time in my life, I have seen the press in a free world, and it is also the first time I have encountered a happy "September 1st" Journalist's Day. Today, when the reactionary demon king Chiang Kai-shek has launched a larger-scale civil war and is frantically attacking the Liberated Areas, I am particularly concerned about the news comrades who are fighting for democracy and peace in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Here, I would like to extend my sincere condolences and infinite sympathy to them, and wish them better health and happiness as they steadfastly adhere to their posts, and fight more bravely and resolutely!

专栏：

　　从黑暗到光明
    燕凌
    “从南到北，从黑暗到光明；再会吧，重庆。………”
    这是一个青年写的一首诗的开头。他把这首诗投寄给开封一个报纸的副刊，没有能够登出来。他觉得是自己写的不好，细心地修改了几遍又寄了去，等了许多天还是不见发表。他仔仔细细再改写一遍，又寄了去。……在编者，内心的痛苦却一次比一次加深。并不是这首诗的内容或者技巧上有什么毛病，可是却总是不敢发表它。在长期的黑暗统治下作编辑工作，根据无尽痛苦的经验教训，在自己内心早已存在着一个无形的“检查尺度”；知道在什么样的情况下怎样措词才能给读者以好的影响而又不显得太“突出”，不致于受打击。他也斟酌了又斟酌，最后，终于又为这位写诗的青年的精神所感动，而把这篇诗稿交到排字房去了。还是怕会“出事情”，临时还又把一些比较带“刺激性”的字眼变更了一下。
    可是，第二天早上醒来，拿来报纸一看，那首诗却变成了：“从北到南，从黑暗到光明；再会吧，解放区。………”他气得眼睛冒出火来，披上衣服就拿了报纸去质问总编辑。总编辑说：“我不知道怎么回事呀！大概是社长改的。”他再找社长去，社长却冷冷地笑着说：“你看我行不行？只改了几个字，就把你的意思完全翻过来啦！…………”………这位编辑终于是离开了这个报社。
    没有把这位编者马上拘捕起来，在统治者看来算是够“客气”的了。可是，对于一个正直的新闻工作者，这样的“强奸”是比拘捕甚至枪毙更难以忍受的啊！
    国民党反动派是世界上最害怕言论自由的一个集团。他们害怕人民翻身，害怕人民认识大时代的真面貌，更害怕他们自己的丑恶暴露在人民大众的面前。所以他们用种种卑劣无耻，残暴不仁的手段，蒙蔽人民的眼睛，塞闭人民的耳朵，封锁人民的嘴巴，不让民间报纸存在，不让正直的新闻工作者自由。在国际新闻自由访问团到重庆的时候，国民党中宣部发言人谈：“我们新闻检查的尺度已经放宽很多了。”可是，连重庆报纸上“欢迎新闻自由使者”的社论也被检扣了，只登出来一个题目，开了一个大“天窗”。透过这个大“天窗”，我们便清清楚楚看到了中国法西斯的面目和法西斯统治下的人民报纸受难的画图。……
    还是我在重庆的时候，有一天我到北碚去看一个朋友，在汽车站正碰到这么一回事：一个壮汉气势汹汹地从汽车上把刚运到的报纸拖下来，狞笑着说：“今年冬天的皮大衣又不成问题啦！”——把这一捆报纸送回去给他的头子，他可以得到一件皮大衣的“奖赏”。气喘喘跑来取报的报童和急着买报的一些人都呆在一边，一句话也不敢说。不过人们是更急着看这一天的报了，知道上面一定登着对统治者不利的消息。
    在重庆附近一个国立大学读书的时候，我和大多数同学一样爱看一种为人民的说话的报纸。一天，忽然不见送报的孩子来了，同学之间互相询问着，都不知道是怎么回事。晚上，在茶馆偶然听到几个人在谈：“那小子牛劲很大，我们三个人收拾他还被他狠狠地打了我们每个人好几拳；把他按倒在地上他还踢，还死抱着一大卷报不放手。后来还是手枪对着他，他才松手了。这小子！以后有机会非‘整’死他不可！”声音很熟，是我们学校里的“特种学生”，也是三青团里的几个积极分子。我于是知道了我们所盼望的报童遭遇了怎么一回事。以后，报纸很久很久也不见送来了，传说着有一个报童在嘉陵江边走着的时候被推倒在江里了。学校当局后来又公开宣布不许卖报的再到学校来，理由是“常常失落东西”。可时同时却又警告订报的同学们说：“你们不要看××日报，看××日报的人思想都有问题！”于是乎，狐狸尾巴就又露出来了。
    给进步报纸寄稿常不见登出，也见不到“不能刊用”的通知；进步报纸常寄不到读者手中，有人曾在重庆邮政总管理局附近看见几个人很辛苦地在向一大堆四川土纸印刷品上面泼水，泼过后又用大木棍乱捣，把那一堆东西捣成烂泥。他好奇地问他们干什么，他们答称是被雇夹专门作这个事的，那大堆的印刷品，是邮局扣留了不往外寄发的报纸。……
    反动的统治者自己也知道他们作的不是好事，所以扣了报纸还要设法灭迹。可是，新闻工作者心头深深刻划的创伤是永远消灭不了的，人民也会永远记清楚是谁迫害了他们，是谁不许替他们说话为它们服务的报纸存在。这笔帐总有一天要清算的。
    去年秋天，我怀着和写《从南到北………》那首诗的青年同样的心情离开了重庆到北方来。在西安、开封所看到的，是一连串摧残绞杀新闻界的暴行。秋天毕竟不是春天，即在政协决议公布以后，由于民贼独夫蒋介石的“偷天换日”，和平民主的春天仍然是没有到来啊。政协闭幕不久，美蒋联合布置好的反苏反共的攻势就发动了，东北风刮了起来，带着冰雹向全国人民袭来。在西安，三月一日，秦风工商报在五味杂字的门市部就被特务暴徒捣毁；接着是记者杨某横遭特务痛打；印刷房里被特务暗暗放进慢性炸弹；法律顾问王任被警备司令部假借“烟犯”的名义枪毙，执行死刑时还把一张大布告贴在该报大门口；在街上抓住报童打，抢劫报纸；威吓商店不许在该报登广告，威胁订户不准订该报，…………
    五月十一日早晨，我在陇海线上某城市一个报社的编辑室坐着，正对着落个不停的细雨沉思，突然有人告诉我有一个客人来了。………
    这是一位在秦风工商日报工作了很久的一位朋友，他突然的到来我没有什么惊讶，因为前两天在上海文汇报上已经看到了他们的报纸被迫停刊的消息。
    他把全身都淋湿透的衣服换了一下，我们相对坐着沉默了好久好久。从他嘴里诉我知道了该报被迫停刊的经过，更知道了李敷仁被特务拖到咸阳原上被枪杀的噩耗………
    这些都是国民党当局宣布“新闻检查取消”了以后的事，是蒋介石宣布了“四大诺言”以后还没有几天的事，而且也就是蒋介石为了部署内战，飞到西安以后几天所发生的事情。
    不久以前我在开封又有一位在河南省党部有熟人的朋友告诉我：“中宣部和组织部都来了一个黑名单，而且密令地方当局就地自行解决；这名单上的人大都是文化界新闻界的。都是谁我还没法知道。……”
    正是到处举行“户口大检查”，“陆空联合作战大演习”的时候，正是大军向东向北大肆调动的时候，正是满火车的坦克、大炮和大批美式装器向东驶去的时候，正是各县加紧催征军粮的时候，………人们明白这是什么意义。国民党反动派要钳制舆论，原是为了坚持独裁进行内战的方便。更大规模的内战的烈火已经被法西斯头子蒋介石动手烧起来了，对正直的新闻工作者的迫害自然就更凶暴了。
    “从南到北，从黑暗到光明………”我终于是来到了解放区，置身在无限光明的土地上了。我看见了在共产党与民主政府的扶植和保障下，人民自己的报纸是怎样蓬勃的发展着，我平生第一次看到了自由天地里的新闻事业，也是第一次逢到可以欢快的“九、一”记者节。在今天，在反动魔王蒋介石已经发动了更大规模的内战疯狂向解放区进攻的时候，我分外关心现在正在国民党统治区为民主和平而奋斗的新闻战友们。在这里，我谨向他们致真挚的慰问与无限的同情，祝他们更健康更愉快的坚守着自己的工作岗位，更勇敢更坚决地斗争下去！
