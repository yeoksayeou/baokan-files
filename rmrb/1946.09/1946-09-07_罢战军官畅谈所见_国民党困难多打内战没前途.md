Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 31st - Several officers, including Tian Congyun, Deputy Brigade Commander of the New 7th Brigade of the 21st Division of the Chiang Army (formerly Deputy Division Commander of the New 7th Division of the 21st Army), who ceased hostilities in the Libao battle east of Hai'an on the 11th of this month, have safely arrived at a certain place in the rear. Our reporter visited Mr. Tian yesterday, and Mr. Tian expressed his deep feelings about his 30 years of military life. He said, "Apart from participating in the campaign to讨袁 (讨袁 means Punish Yuan Shikai after he proclaimed himself emperor) in the early years of the Republic of China and the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, most of them were meaningless civil wars." (Note: Mr. Tian is from Huangyi County, Yunnan Province, is 54 years old this year, and graduated from Yunnan Military Academy in the sixth year of the Republic of China. He once served as the commander of the Yunnan Garrison Regiment, but most of his time was spent in the Sichuan Army.) Regarding his participation in this civil war, Mr. Tian said: "My department was originally stationed in the Anqing, Guangde, and Xuanxian areas. Before the reorganization was completed, we were suddenly ordered to move to Jiangyin, and then we crossed the river directly to Rugao. Only then did we realize that we were walking onto the civil war battlefield..." At this point, Mr. Tian said angrily: "The Kuomintang reactionaries used miscellaneous troops as vanguards in the civil war, intending to eliminate dissidents, which is very obvious. I did not die in the war against the enemy for eight years of the War of Resistance, but came to die in the civil war. As long as there is a little conscience, no one is willing to." Regarding the future of the civil war, Mr. Tian believes that "there are many difficulties for the Kuomintang in fighting a civil war. First of all, the Kuomintang-controlled areas have exhausted their manpower. The number of young men in the inland provinces is decreasing year by year, and the land is generally barren. Taking the garrison of the New 7th Division as an example, the area produces 1 million dan of grain. In addition to the local food, there is still surplus grain for export. However, under the government's heavy taxation, there is currently no surplus grain for export. The situation in other areas is even more serious. The nature of the United States helping Chiang Kai-shek is the same as that of Japan helping Wang Jingwei. It will not receive anyone's sympathy. Not only the Chinese people oppose it, but also the American people oppose it." He believes that the strength of the Communist Party should not be underestimated, because one person in the Kuomintang area may not be a force, while the people in the liberated areas have a force in one person. Fighting the civil war will not benefit Chiang Kai-shek." Luo Shengxian, deputy battalion commander of the 1st Battalion, Liu Zhemin, deputy battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion, and Wang Xiandong, deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of the Brigade, unanimously denounced the various facts that Chiang Kai-shek excluded dissidents and treated non-direct troops harshly, and expressed their indignation in unison. Talking about the entire brigade laying down their weapons this time, Mr. Liu Zhemin cited Chen Battalion as an example, saying: "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone wanted to retire and go home. No one wanted to fight a civil war. There were many deserters along the way during the march. The 2nd Battalion of the 21st Regiment escaped more than 30 people in Lanzhou alone. After arriving at the front line, 21 people died of illness in the entire battalion, and more than 90 people suffered from illness. If we had known that the New Fourth Army treated officers and soldiers who ceased hostilities well, who would be willing to make unnecessary sacrifices?"

　　罢战军官畅谈所见
    国民党困难多打内战没前途
    【新华社苏中前线卅一日电】本月十一日海安以东李堡战斗中罢战蒋军廿一师新七旅副旅长（原二十一军新七师副师长）田从云以下军官多人，顷已安全到达后方某地。本社记者日昨前往访问，田氏对其三十年部队生活表示不胜感慨。他说：“除了民初参加讨袁之役和八年抗战外，大都是无意义的内战。”（按：田氏云南凰仪县人现年五十四岁，民国六年毕业于云南讲武堂，曾任云南警备团团长，但大部时间是在川军中渡过。）关于此次参加内战，田氏称：“敝部原驻安庆、广德、宣城一带，整编尚未就序，忽奉命调驻江阴，旋又度江直达如皋，始知走上内战战场……”。至此田氏复愤然称：“国民党反动派使杂牌军充当内战先锋，意在消灭异已，至为明显。抗战八年未死于对敌作战，而来在内战中送死，只要稍有天良的人，决不愿意。”对于内战前途，田氏认为：“打内战对国民党是困难很多的，首先国民党统治区人力已至枯竭境地，内地各省壮丁年年减少，土地普遍荒芜。仅以新七师驻地来说，该地产粮达一百万石，除当地民食外，尚有余粮输出。但在政府横征暴敛之下，目前已无余粮输出，其他各区情形更为严重。美国所助蒋介石与日本帮汪精卫性质相同，不会收到任何人同情，不但中国人民反对，即美国人民亦反对。他认为共产党实力不可轻视，因为国民党地区内一个人不一定是一份力量，而解放区人民则一个人便有一份力量。内战打下去，对蒋介石没有好处。”该旅一十一团一营营副罗声先、二营营副刘哲民、三营营副王先东一致痛陈蒋介石排斥异已苛待非嫡系部队的种种事实，同声愤慨。谈到此次全旅放下武器，刘哲民氏举陈营为例称：“抗战胜利后都想退伍回家，谁也不愿打内战。行军中沿途逃兵甚多。二十一团二营仅在兰州一地即逃走三十余人。到达前线后，全营病死者二十一人，患病者达九十名之多。早知道新四军优待罢战官兵时，谁还愿意作无谓牺牲呢？”
