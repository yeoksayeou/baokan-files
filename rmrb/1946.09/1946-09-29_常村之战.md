　　The Battle of Changcun
　　Yin Bangxian
            (I)
    After the battle of Xinzhuang (two miles southeast of Huixian City), the troops universally harbored the thought: "Why don't they let us fight? We can't even get a taste of the meat!" "It's shameful not to fight; we can't even get a bullet casing!" "What's going on? They said they wanted us to fight, but why did it change again? We have to fight!" The troops were clamoring about this all day long. They felt that the First and Second Detachments had both fought, obtained guns, and captured personnel. However, we challenged the First and Second Detachments, but we didn't get to fight. How will we summarize this in the future? Despite explaining and interpreting from the perspective of combat significance and tasks, it couldn't calm down these heroes.

    The stubborn enemy seemed completely unaware of the thoughts of our heroes. The 67th Regiment of the 85th Army, led by the Deputy Brigade Commander with three mountain guns, rushed from Jixian to Huixian overnight (night of August 29th). At dawn on the 30th, they invaded Changcun (fifteen miles northeast of Huixian City), which had just been liberated on the 20th of this month, and also occupied Phoenix Mountain, one mile southeast of the village.

    The sound of gunfire and artillery constantly struck people's eardrums. The soldiers' blood, along with this smell of gunpowder, flowed even faster through their veins. The order that everyone was waiting for, "Tonight's task is for our detachment to eliminate the attacking enemy," finally arrived. The mission was to first eliminate the enemy on Phoenix Mountain and then cooperate with friendly neighbors to eliminate the enemy in Changcun.

    Company Commander Comrade Liu Guangyi, platoon leader, and seventeen comrades all fought while ill. Four sick new comrades from the Ninth Squad, Yao Yintun, Niu Fuxi, and Deputy Squad Leader Zhang Yutao, said: "As soon as we heard we were going to fight, our illness became lighter."
            (II)
    The evening glow reflected the white clouds, and the sky was quiet without even a breeze. Suddenly, a burst of "Bang! Bang! Crack! Crack!..." of rifle and machine gun fire came from the foot of the south mountain, startling a flock of crows returning to their nests. The soldiers, who were taking a break in the middle of a mobilization meeting, seemed not to have heard it. From the hill, using binoculars, one could see a group of stubborn enemies on Phoenix Mountain in the southwest, constructing fortifications—chevaux de frise, walls… in an attempt to hold firm.

    The troops moved forward quietly, only the slight sound of "Scrape! Scrape!" of footsteps could be heard, one after another, passing through the trapezoidal cornfield, approaching the bunker (a small bunker north of Phoenix Mountain). Bullets whizzed overhead. The assault team dispersed and quickly approached the enemy. They heard someone in the tortoise shell say, "Get the grenades and bayonets ready." Then, he said softly, "Give me a grenade." No sooner said than done, a grenade exploded, and the assault team surged forward like a flood from a breached dike.

    Squad Leader Su Fuhong of the Fourth Squad of the Eighth Detachment, a communist party member and hero of enemy killing, was the first to rush to the bottom of the bunker. After stuffing two grenades through the gun hole into the bunker, suddenly something was thrown out of the bunker from behind him. He quickly lay down. "Boom!" it sounded. He immediately got up, and a second one came out. He struck it hard with his palm and knocked it back in. The stubborn enemy had to suffer the consequences of his own actions. Comrade Su turned around as quickly as a swallow, put up a ladder, and climbed to the top of the bunker. He dug a hole and threw grenades inside. After the enemy was eliminated, he personally obtained a rifle.

    Comrade Niu Yonghuai is the cook of our Ninth Squad. He is strong, loves to laugh, and during the battle of Fanzhuang, he bravely carried fourteen wounded and dead comrades off the battlefield under enemy fire. Everyone elected him as a model, and the higher-ups awarded him a certificate and money. This time, he was even more motivated. He followed the troops and rushed up, threw five grenades, and carried a box of bullets and a rifle down from the bunker. Other comrades happily said, "Old Niu got a gun!" He smiled and said, "I have to get a machine gun next time." He put the things down and went to carry the colored signal flags.

    The "blooming bullets" inside the bunker were unbearable for the stubborn enemy. They rushed out. Comrade Zhang Daoxian of our Seventh Squad shot two enemies with two shots and shouted, "Brothers of the Central Army, surrender! We will treat you well." "Don't fight a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek. Surrender and you won't be killed." At this time, Comrade Zhang jumped into the bunker and carried out a light machine gun.

    A few minutes later, the stubborn enemy was annihilated, and we began to use the enemy's machine guns and ammunition to launch an attack on the top of Phoenix Mountain.
            (III)
    "Boom! Boom!...Crack! Crack!..." Sparks constantly rose from the top of the mountain. This was the signal for the impending charge. The soldiers smiled in their hearts. "Charge! See how well our machine guns are firing!" It was really too beautiful. As soon as the artillery began to fire beyond the target, nearly two hundred enemies rolled down the mountain like rabbits. The soldiers were a little disappointed: "Today we fought another 'pus bag,' who really knows how to run."

    Two Kuomintang soldiers who failed to escape said: "We are the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion, led by Battalion Commander Jia Ruhao with two mortars, two heavy machine guns, and our company, guarding this hilltop..." Someone gently interjected, "Why did you run so fast?" "Why?" He replied, "Not long after the fighting started below (referring to the bunker), the Second Platoon Leader limped and gasped as he climbed up to report to the Battalion Commander: all the men and guns in his platoon were gone. He was also wounded when he ran out. The Battalion Commander was furious when he heard this, stomped his feet, and cursed: 'Damn it, I told you to defend to the death, why did you run back? If I didn't see that you were wounded, I would have shot you...' After scolding him like that, he turned around and said to us: 'Don't fire your guns, get your bayonets and grenades ready, and when you see the people, throw them out all at once. Anyone who doesn't listen will be shot!' After saying that, he immediately sent a messenger to call the Deputy Battalion Commander to bring four heavy machine guns and the Fourth Company up. Not a few minutes later, a shell landed right on the top of the mountain, 'Boom!' The heavy machine gun squad leader was blown over. The Battalion Commander was startled and quickly ordered the Company Commander: 'Don't retreat,' but he himself hurriedly ran away first with the heavy machine guns and artillery. We were even more unable to hold on and were all ready to run, but who knew you would come up before we saw you..."

    On the hillside a hundred or so meters away, there was another burst of "Boom! Boom!..." Someone shouted from the bottom of the mountain: "Don't misunderstand, don't misunderstand!" Comrade Deng Zhanting and other comrades from our Seventh Squad took the opportunity to shout: "It's a misunderstanding, don't fight, come up." Two messengers came up. "Don't move, raise your hands." They were captured lightly. In this way, eight were captured in a row. A prisoner named Chen Xiao shouted: "Deputy Battalion Commander, come up, the Battalion Commander is here." The soldiers gripped their guns even tighter, preparing to eliminate the enemy with bayonets. However, the cunning enemy heard that the shout just now had a northern accent, and they had secretly slipped away long ago.
            (IV)
    The next day (31st), the enemy used mountain guns, mortars... to bombard the twenty-nine corpses they had abandoned on Phoenix Mountain for half a day, as if punishing them for running too slowly.

    Our soldiers, however, grinned as they wiped down the spoils of last night – two light machine guns, two converted hand-held machine guns... and other weapons. Chen Xiao, who had been liberated, was telling: "Chinese trains pull American goods from south of the Yellow River to Hebei to sell, and we stood guard for the American soldiers in Jixian... Chinese people learn from the Americans in wearing clothes, we really don't agree... There's only gambling in the ranks, and the officers say: 'The Yellow River north will sooner or later belong to the Eighth Route Army...'" His conclusion was: "Chairman Chiang's head is muddled!" The Kuomintang army didn't even have time to bury the corpses that day and hurried back to Jixian.

    Immediately, the word spread around Changcun: the 85th Army is the Central Army's most powerful force north of the Yellow River, and they were defeated by the Eighth Route Army. Miscellaneous troops are even more afraid. People's worried faces were replaced with smiles, and they were liberated just like Changcun.

　　常村之战
　　尹邦宪
            （一）
    新庄（辉县城东南二里）战斗之后，部队中普遍地酝酿着：“为什么不让我们打，有肉也吃不上”。“不打，多丢人，连一颗子弹壳也得不上”！“怎么？说是要我们打，为啥又变了呢？不打可不行”。部队里一天到晚这样嚷嚷着，他们觉得：一、二分队都打上了，得了枪，捉了人马。可是，我们是向一、二分队挑了战的，却没有打上，这将来如何总结呢？尽管你从战斗意义上和任务上去说明、解释，可是终不能使这些英雄们心气平下来。
    顽敌似乎全然不知道我们英雄们心事，八十五军六十七团由副旅长带着三门山炮，连夜（八月二十九日夜）由汲县赶到辉县来。三十日黎明又将本月二十日刚解放了的常村（辉县城东北十五里）侵占了，也侵占了村东南一里处的凤凰山。
    枪炮声不断地打击着人们的耳鼓，战士们的血液，伴随着这种火药味，在血管里流的更快了，大家所等待着的“今晚的任务，我分队消灭进攻的敌人”的命令，终于到来了，任务是：先消灭凤凰山之敌，然后配合友邻消灭常村敌人。
    连长刘光义同志，排长、战士十七个同志都带病作战，九小队有病的新同志姚银屯、牛福喜、副班长张玉桃等四同志说：“一说打仗，病就轻了”。
            （二）
    晚霞映照着白云，天空静静的连一点微风都没有。忽而由南山脚下传来一阵“砰！砰！格！格！……”的步机枪声，惊散了一群归宿的乌鸦，那正在半途中利用休息时间开着动员会的战士们，像是是不曾听见似的。在土丘上用望远镜可以看见西南方凤凰山上的一群顽敌正在构筑工事——鹿砦、围墙……以图固守。
    部队静悄悄地向前运动着，只能听到“擦！擦！”的轻微脚步声，一个接着一个，穿过了梯形的玉茭地，将近碉堡了（凤凰山北的一个小碉堡），子弹从头上掠过，突击队散开了，迅速的接近敌人，听见那乌龟壳里有个人说：“把手榴弹、刺刀准备好”。接着又轻轻的说：“给我一个手榴弹”。说时迟，那时快，手榴弹一响，突击队像决口的洪流似的一涌而上。
    八小队四班长，共产党员、杀敌英雄苏福红同志首先冲到碉堡下，把手榴弹由枪眼向碉堡里塞进去两个以后，忽然他背后由碉堡里掷出个东西，他很快的卧下，“轰！”的一声响了，他马上爬起来，第二个又出来了，他用手掌猛然一击，给打了回去，顽敌于是只好自作自受了，苏同志像燕子似的飞快一转身，架着梯子，上了碉堡顶，他挖洞向碉里投弹。敌人消灭之后，他亲手得了一支步枪。
    牛永怀同志、是我们九小队的炊事员，身体强壮，说话爱笑，范庄战斗他勇敢地在敌火下一连背了十四个伤亡的同志，大家选他作模范，上级赠他奖状，奖他钱，这次他的劲头更大了，他随着部队冲了上去，打了五个手榴弹，在碉堡内背了一箱子弹，一支步枪下来了，别的同志高兴的说：“老牛得了枪啦”！他笑笑嘻嘻的说：“以后我非得机关枪不行。”说着把东西放下，就又去背彩号了。
    碉内的“开花弹”顽敌吃不消了，他们向外冲，我们七小队的张道贤同志两枪打死两敌，喊着：“中央军弟兄们，缴枪吧，我们优待你们”。“不要替蒋介石打内战了，缴枪不杀”。张同志，这时跳进碉堡抱了一挺轻机关枪出来。
    几分钟之后，顽敌被歼灭了，我们开始用着敌人的机关枪和弹药对凤凰山顶展开攻击战。
            （三）
    “轰！轰！……格！格！……”火花不断地由山顶上冒起，这是将要冲锋的信号，战士们心里笑了，“冲！看咱们的机枪打的多好”！真是太漂亮了，炮兵刚刚开始超越射击，立刻将近二百敌人，就像兔子一样的滚下了山。战士们有些失望了：“今天又打了个‘脓包’真他妈的会跑”。
    有两个没能跑掉的蒋军说：“我们是二营六连，由营长贾儒豪带着两门迫击炮，两挺重机枪，和我们连，守这个山头……”有人轻轻的插了一句：“你们为啥跑的那样快？”“为啥？”他答：“下边（指碉堡）打起来不多一会儿，二排排长就一拐一拐的喘着气爬上来向营长报告：他们排的人枪都完啦。他一个人也是负了伤才跑出来的。营长听了，大发脾气，跺着脚：“妈的×，教你死守，你为啥跑回来？不看你负了伤，非枪毙你不行……”这样臭骂了一顿，返转来又向我们说：“不准打枪，把刺刀、手榴弹准备好，等看到了人，一下子打出去，那个不听，枪毙”！说完，马上派传令兵去调副营长带四挺重机枪和四连上来。没有几分钟，一个炮弹正落在山顶上，“轰”！的一下，把个重机枪班长炸倒了，营长吓了一跳，连忙给连长下令：“不准退”，可是他自己却慌慌张张的带着重机枪和炮先跑了。我们是愈发沉不住气了，都准备好要跑，谁知没看见你们就上来了……”
    百十米达处的山坡上，又“轰！轰！……”的响了一阵，山下有人在喊：“不要误会，不要误会！”我们七小队邓占廷等同志就趁机喊：“打误会了，不要打了，上来吧”。两个传令兵上来了，“不要动，举起手来”。他们轻轻地当了俘虏。这样接连捉住了八个，一个俘虏叫陈孝喊着：“副营长上来吧，营长在这里呢”。战士们枪握的更紧了，准备着用刺刀消灭敌人。可是，狡猾的顽敌听了方才有的喊话是北方口音，他们早偷偷地溜走了。
            （四）
    第二日（三十一日）敌人用山炮、迫击炮……向他们自己丢掉在凤凰山的二十九具尸体轰击了半天，好像在处罚他们跑的太慢了似的。
    我们的战士却笑嘻嘻地擦洗着昨夜的胜利品——两挺轻机枪，两挺加造手提机枪……等武器。被解放了的陈孝在诉说着：“中国的火车从黄河南把美国货拉到河北来卖，我们在汲县给美国兵站岗……中国人穿衣服要学美国，我们实在不服气……队伍里光赌钱，官长们说：‘黄河北迟早是八路军的……’”他的结语是：“蒋主席的头脑昏了”！蒋军这天连掩埋尸体都没来得及，就急急忙忙的窜回汲县去了。
    马上常村一带传播着：八十五军是中央军黄河北顶厉害的队伍，都叫八路军给打败了，杂牌队还怕。人们愁苦着的脸，挂上了笑容，和常村一样的被解放了。
