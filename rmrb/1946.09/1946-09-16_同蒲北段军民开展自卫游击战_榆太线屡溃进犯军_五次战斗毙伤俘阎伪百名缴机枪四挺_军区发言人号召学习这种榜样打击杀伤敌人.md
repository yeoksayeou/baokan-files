　　Military and Civilians in the Northern Section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway Launch Self-Defense Guerrilla Warfare
    Invading Troops Repeatedly Crushed on the Yuci-Taiyuan Line
    Five Battles Result in Over 100 Enemy Casualties (Killed, Wounded, or Captured) and Four Machine Guns Seized
    Military Region Spokesperson Calls for Learning from This Example to Strike and Kill the Enemy
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 12th] The military and civilians in the liberated areas of the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway have enthusiastically launched a patriotic self-defense guerrilla war to strike back at the invading Yan Xishan and puppet troops. On the 7th of last month, over 200 Yan Xishan and puppet troops from Yuci invaded Wanghao Village, eight *li* from the Yuci-Taiyuan road, to conscript men and seize grain. Our local troops and militiamen completely routed the invading troops, capturing two and seizing one light machine gun. On the 11th, a unit of the Taiyuan Independent Battalion ambushed over 100 Yan Xishan troops who had invaded from Chaoyang Village, Taiyuan, and completely routed them. On the 14th, a squad from the Qixian Independent Battalion ambushed near Duanjiayao, killing 13 Yan Xishan troops who were guarding a war bunker inside the railway line. The war bunker was then destroyed. On the 16th, over 300 Yan Xishan and puppet troops who invaded Hao Village from the Nan Hongshan station in Pingyao were also routed by our forces, and 40 carts were recovered and returned to the masses. By the 18th, over 40 Yan Xishan troops who invaded Chengcun, Southeast Mountain, in Qixian were completely annihilated by our local mass armed forces. In the above battles, we killed or wounded 83 invading troops, captured 21, and seized four light machine guns, one submachine gun, three grenade launchers, and 59 rifles. A spokesperson for the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region pointed out: This kind of mass self-defense guerrilla war, which strikes and kills the enemy everywhere, is a glorious example worthy of learning. He called on the military and civilians throughout the region to widely launch such mass self-defense guerrilla wars in the areas where the invading troops arrive, in order to strike at the reactionary faction's offensive.
