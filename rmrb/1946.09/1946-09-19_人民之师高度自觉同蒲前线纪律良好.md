　　People's Army Highly Conscious, Disciplined on the Tongpu Front
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 16th dispatch] The Tongpu Front troops newspaper published an article entitled "Good Discipline in the Liberation of Hongdong," which stated, "The discipline in the Battle of Hongdong was excellent. During the battle, only the headquarters called to open one civilian house, and all the troops were concealed on the streets. After the battle, only the city defense troops remained in the city, and the rest were withdrawn outside the city. At this time, except for the enemy and puppet agencies guarded by the pickets, merchants and citizens still slept with their doors closed. At dawn, local government workers entered the city to handle public materials, weed out traitors, enforce martial law, and carry out propaganda and other post-war work, and the city order was not disturbed in the slightest, and the masses were not alarmed in any way. They all praised 'the strict discipline of the troops'." The reasons for this are summarized as: (1) All commanders and fighters have a high degree of ideological awareness, understand the purpose of fighting, which is to liberate the people and liberate the city, not to ruin the people or the city. And put forward specific slogans: "The fighting troops only have the task of eliminating the enemy, not collecting wealth," "Don't go where there are no enemies," "Get out of the city after eliminating the enemy," "Don't enter civilian houses, don't wander around." In addition, detailed organizational methods were set up, such as the City Defense Headquarters Working Committee, and the Picket Team, with very clear tasks. Detailed measures were also established for the handling of enemy property, transportation, culture, education, religious organizations, etc. (2) Military and political leaders intensified their control of the troops, led by example, and supervised and prevented those who violated discipline. (3) Send strong political workers to participate in the City Defense Working Committee, lead the picket team, and have the power to interfere, stop, detain, and inspect, and mobilize the staff to be selfless, resolute, bold, and conscientious. (4) The political organs announced before the war: "Whoever has good discipline will be given a pennant for not violating the slightest thing," plus the enthusiastic participation and consolation of the masses, which greatly encouraged the troops. They were all determined to strive to be models of not violating the slightest thing.

　　人民之师高度自觉同蒲前线纪律良好
    【本报阳城十六日电】同蒲前线部队报登载一文，题为《解放洪洞的良好纪律》，内称“洪洞之战，纪律良好。在战斗中，仅指挥部唤开一家民房，所有部队都隐蔽于街上。战斗结束后，城内仅留城防部队，其余都撤出城外。这时除敌伪所驻机关由纠察队驻守，商人及市民仍闭门睡觉。拂晓时地方机关工作人员，即进城分别进行处理公共物资，锄奸、戒严、宣传等善后工作，城市秩序丝毫不乱，群众未受任何惊扰。一致称赞“部队纪律严明”。总结其原因：（一）全体指战员有高度思想自觉，明确打仗的目的，是解放人民，解放城市，不是糟害人民，及糟害城市。并提出具体口号：“战斗部队只有消灭敌人的任务，没有收集资财的任务”，“没有敌人的地方就不去”，“消灭敌人就出城”，“不进民房，不乱窜”。另外又定出细密的组织办法，如城防司令部工作委员会，和纠察队等，任务非常明确。对敌人资财、交通、文化、教育、宗教等团体的处理，也定了详细办法。（二）军政领导干部加紧掌握部队，以身作则，监督防止违犯纪律分子。（三）派强有力的政工干部参加城防工作委员会，带领纠察队，有干涉、制止、扣押、检查的权力，并动员工作人员要铁面无情，坚决大胆，认真负责。（四）政治机关在战前宣布：“谁纪律好，赠给秋毫无犯的锦旗”，再加上群众热烈参战和慰问，对部队的鼓励作用很大。都决心争取秋毫无犯的模范。
