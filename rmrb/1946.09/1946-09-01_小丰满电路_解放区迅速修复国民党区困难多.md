Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th: According to the Changchun "New Life Daily" on the 18th: Within ten days after the Xiaofengman power transmission agreement, the lines in the Democratic Allied Forces-controlled area, from Qingyuan to Shanchengzhen, have been quickly repaired. The line between Meihekou and Fushun is also scheduled to be completed before August 25. However, in the Kuomintang-controlled area between Meihekou and Jilin, the repair team faces the greatest difficulties. The newspaper revealed that the reason is the lack of electric wires, because most of the electric wires originally stored in Meihekou, about 10,000 meters, were taken by Chiang Kai-shek's army to build fortifications for the civil war.

    解放区迅速修复国民党区困难多
    【新华社哈尔滨二十九日电】据长春《新生报》十八日载：自小丰满通电协定后十天之内，民主联军所在地区，从清源到山城镇的线路已抢修完毕，梅河口到抚顺间线路，亦预定八月二十五日前竣工。而国民党控制区梅河口到吉林中间，抢修队最感困难。该报透露原因系电线缺乏，盖原存梅河口之大部电线，约有万余公尺被蒋介石军队拿去作内战的工事。
