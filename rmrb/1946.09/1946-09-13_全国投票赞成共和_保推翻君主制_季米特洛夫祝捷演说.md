　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: Sofia dispatch: The results of the Bulgarian monarchy referendum on September 8th show that the vast majority of voters favored a republic, with some villages reporting over 90% voting in favor. The voting process was orderly. Sofia held a rally of 450,000 people on the 9th to celebrate the victory of the referendum. Bulgarian Communist leader Dimitrov, in a broadcast to the nation after the victory, stated that the republic "will bring peace to the Balkans." Dimitrov continued: "Bulgaria will not be a Soviet republic, nor will there be a dictatorship again. The basic fact is the unity and friendship of the majority of the working masses and the Slavic people, in opposition to any aggression." Unofficial sources state that the Bulgarian royal family – young King Simeon and the Queen Mother – will be exiled to Egypt.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: As a result of the Bulgarian referendum, the republic has won, and the monarchy has been overthrown. From now on, Bulgaria will move forward on the road to democracy and progress.

　　Bulgaria is a small country in Southeastern Europe, with a population of over 6.89 million. At the beginning of the war, it was a puppet of Fascist Germany. It wasn't until the second half of 1942 that Bulgaria’s progressive parties (People's Democratic Union, Communist Party, Social Democratic Labor Party, National Agrarian Union) and people from all walks of life organized the Fatherland Front, launched guerrilla warfare against the German Fascist army, and on September 9th of the same year, when the Soviet army entered Bulgarian territory, the leader of the Fatherland Front, Georgiev, rose to organize the democratic government of the Fatherland Front, made peace with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and declared war on Germany. The Fatherland Front government has only been established for four years, and it has already transformed Bulgaria into a New Democratic country. In the government, Communists serve as Deputy Prime Minister and ministers of five ministries, including Interior and Finance. Prime Minister Georgiev and other ministers are also well-known democratic and progressive figures. This democratic government has implemented many progressive measures: such as land reform, nationalization of large enterprises, punishing Fascist war criminals, and establishing friendly relations with countries such as the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Such a good government has naturally won the support of the people throughout the country. In the general election last November, more than 90% of the voters voted to elect candidates from the Fatherland Front.
    
    However, reactionaries at home and abroad do not like this good government; what they prefer in Bulgaria is a monarchical government. After the First World War, Germany supported the Bulgarian Crown Prince Boris. Now, American and British reactionaries are attempting to oppose the Fatherland Front through Bulgarian reactionary figures such as Petkov and want to use the young King Simeon (who is the son of the late King Boris, who turned Bulgaria into a Nazi vassal) to maintain the imperial system, but the results of the referendum shattered their dreams.

### 全国投票赞成共和  保推翻君主制  季米特洛夫祝捷演说

　　全国投票赞成共和
    保推翻君主制
    季米特洛夫祝捷演说
    【新华社延安十日电】索菲亚讯：九月八日，保加利亚皇朝复决结果，绝大多数选民投票赞成共和制，若干乡村投票赞成共和者达百分之九十以上。进行投票时秩序井然，索菲亚于九日曾举行四十五万人的庆祝复决胜利大会，保共领袖季米特洛夫于复决胜利后向全国人民广播称：共和制“将给巴尔干带来和平”。季氏继称：“保国将不是一个苏维埃共和国，也再不会有独裁制度，基本事实是人民中的大多数劳苦群众及斯拉夫民族的团结与友谊，以反对任何侵略。”据非官方消息称：保王室——薛米洪幼王及皇太后等将流亡至埃及。
    【新华社延安十日电】保加利亚复决结果，共和制已获胜利，君主制已被推翻。从此保国将更向民主与进步的道路一往直前。
    保加利亚是东南欧的一个小国，居民有六百八十九万多人，这次大战初时是法西斯德国的一个奴仆，直到四二年下半年保国进步党派（人民民主联军、共产党、社会民主工党、全国农民联盟）团体和各阶层人民组织了祖国阵线，展开游击战反对德国法西斯军，并在同年九月九日苏军进兵保境那一天，祖国阵线领袖乔吉也夫起而组织祖国阵线的民主政府，与苏英美讲和，并对德宣战。祖国阵线政府成立到今天才四年，已使保国变成了一个新民主主义的国家。在政府中，共产党员当了副总理、内政、财政等五个部长，总理乔吉也夫和其他各部部长亦都是著名的民主与进步人士。这一民主政府实行了许多进步措施：如土地改革，大企业国有，惩办法西斯战犯，与苏南捷等国建立了友好关系。这样的好政府，当然获得了全国人民的拥护，在去年十一月大选中，百分之九十以上的选民都投票选举祖国阵线的候选人。
    但是保国国内外的反动派不喜欢这个好政府，它们在祖国所喜欢的是君主政府。在第一次大战后德国扶持保国皇太子鲍利斯，现在美英反动派企图通过保国的反动头子皮特可夫等反对祖国阵线，并想利用幼皇薛米洪（他是曾把保国变成纳粹附庸的已故保王艾利斯的儿子）保持帝制，但公民投票的结果，粉碎了他们的梦想。
