【This Newspaper, Handan, 31st】 General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, recently sent a telegram to the entire country opposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' instigation of full-scale civil war. The full text is as follows:

To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, Mr. Feng, Chairman Mao in Yan'an, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Gentlemen of the Democratic League, Directors of various headquarters, Commanders-in-Chief, Division Commanders, Newspaper Offices, Legal Entities, and Fellow Countrymen:

Since the Japanese bandits surrendered, our rivers and mountains were restored, and the Three Great Agreements were successively announced, the people of the whole country were jubilant, believing that peace and democracy were in sight. The whole country could unite and strive together, and a new China of independence, freedom, democracy, unity, prosperity, and strength would not be difficult to achieve in the near future. However, contrary to expectations, for several months, the Kuomintang reactionaries, supported by the erroneous policies of the United States, have persisted in dictatorship and civil war, and have destroyed the people's freedom, completely ruining this solemn agreement. Although the people of the whole country have called for a ceasefire, and the Communist troops have exercised forbearance for the sake of the country, the reactionaries have blatantly disregarded this, becoming more and more arrogant. Recently, they have even exerted all their strength to launch a nationwide civil war, massacring democratic figures and creating a nationwide atmosphere of terror. Externally, they have sold out all sovereignty in exchange for American military assistance, disregarding the fate of the nation and the people. As we watch, China, which is suffering deeply, having barely escaped the devastation of the Japanese bandits, is about to become an American colony. Thinking of this, my heart aches! Shuxun and others, since dedicating themselves to the revolution, participating in the war of resistance against Japan, and even up to the Handan uprising last winter, have consistently held the purpose of saving the country and the people. Now, witnessing the nation and the people once again being betrayed by the reactionaries, facing an unprecedented and severe crisis, my heart is filled with indignation, and I find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, based on the duty of "every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation," I express my views on the current state of affairs and state the solemn position of our army.

The Kuomintang follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and implements the Three Principles of the People, which are the basic guidelines of the National Revolution. The Communist Party believes that the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today and is willing to strive for their thorough implementation (as seen in Mr. Mao Zedong's declaration) and has already truly implemented the democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People in the Liberated Areas. Therefore, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are initially not different in politics. The Kuomintang has no reason to launch an anti-communist and anti-people civil war. Moreover, after the announcement of the ceasefire order, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the military reorganization plan, the people of the whole country and world public opinion have recognized that these measures are the only reasonable and legal way to resolve all current disputes. If they can be implemented, not only will all problems be solved easily, but the road to democratic constitutionalism can also be started soon. Why abandon this path and insist on seeking a solution by force, causing endless worries to the country? Moreover, the continuation of civil war will lead to endless conflicts. The result will not only be an unprecedented catastrophe for the nation and the people, but the reactionaries themselves will also find it difficult to escape the tragic fate of "playing with fire and burning themselves." What is the point of this suicidal civil war for the reactionaries, digging their own graves!

In short, today, China will be reborn with peace and democracy, and perish with dictatorship and civil war. Peace and democracy are the only way out for China today, and also the only way out for the Kuomintang reactionaries. For the sake of saving the country and saving themselves, the Kuomintang should immediately change its wrong policies and quickly cooperate with various democratic parties and social elites to promptly promote the implementation of the following items in order to save the current crisis:

1. Reaffirm the ceasefire order and realize comprehensive peace.
2. Rapidly implement the Three Great Agreements, abolish the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, and organize democratic coalition governments at all levels.
3. Practice the Four Promises and ban secret service agencies.
4. Recover the lost sovereignty from the United States, decline American military assistance, and demand that American troops withdraw from China.

Only in this way can the Kuomintang regain the trust of the people and complete its historical mission. If it does not do so and continues to adhere to its "traitorous" civil war dictatorship policy, willingly isolating itself from the people, then all the officers and soldiers of our army, in order to uphold the interests of the people and strive for national independence, democracy, and peace, and strive for the thorough implementation of the Three Great Agreements, vow to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all democratic forces throughout the country to fight the reactionaries to the end. We will not stop until we achieve our goals. We hope that all our fathers, brothers, sisters, and patriotic people throughout the country will unite and fight together. We especially hope that all our military comrades throughout the country will deeply lament the national crisis, see through the conspiracy of the reactionaries, recognize the trend of world peace and democracy, and resolutely launch anti-civil war uprisings and join the camp of peace and democracy. Saving the country is saving oneself, and serving the people is serving oneself. Merit, guilt, disaster, and fortune are only a matter of a single thought. In urgent telegram, I am extremely worried!

Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army
Liao Anbang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief
Fan Longzhang, Army Commander of the First Army
Qiao Mingli, Army Commander of the Second Army, and
All officers and soldiers kowtow together.

　　高树勋将军率部通电全国
    反对反动派挑动内战
    号召全国军界袍泽举行反内战起义
    【本报邯郸三十一日电】民主建国军总司令高树勋将军顷通电全国，反对国民党反动派挑动全面内战，全文如下：
    南京蒋主席、冯先生、延安毛主席、朱总司令、民主同盟诸先生、各行营主任、各总司令、各军师长、各报馆、各法团、全国同胞公鉴：
    自日寇投降，河山光复，三大协定，继之公布，全国人民莫不欢庆，方谓从此和平民主有望，举国团结一致努力，独立自由民主统一富强之新中国不难指日实现，乃事与愿违，数阅月来，国民党反动派在美国错误政策支持下，坚持独裁内战，摧残人民自由，已将此庄严协议破坏无遗，虽举国人民呼吁停战，中共部队忍让为国，而反动派竟悍然不顾，得寸进尺，近更倾其全力，掀起全国大内战，一面惨杀民主人士，造成全国大恐怖，对外则出卖一切主权，换取美国军事援助，而置国家民族命脉于不顾，行看灾难深重之中国，方庆脱日寇摧残，又将沦为美殖民地，言念及此，痛心曷已！树勋等自献身革命，参加抗战，以迄客冬邯郸起义，一贯宗旨，为救国救民，今目睹国家民族又在反动派断送下，而临空前严重危机，中怀愤激缄口难安，爰本“国家兴亡匹夫有责”之义，对当前国是，一抒所见并以表明本军之严正立场。
    国民党遵奉总理遗教，实行三民主义，乃国民革命之基本方针，共产党认为三民主义为中国今日之所必需，愿为其彻底实现而奋斗（见毛泽东先生宣言）并已在解放区内真正实现三民主义之民主政治，是则国共两党在政治上初无不同，国民党实无任何理由必欲发动反共反人民之内战，且停战命令政协决议整军方案公布后，全国人民举世舆论，已咸认此举确为解决当前一切纠纷之唯一合理合法途径，倘能付之实施，不仅一切问题迎刃而解，民主宪政大道亦可早日开始，奈何舍此不由必欲寻求武力解决途径，重贻国家无穷之忧，况内战延续，兵连祸结，其结果不仅国家民族将遭受空前浩劫，即反动派自身恐亦难逃“玩火自焚”之悲运，是反动派又何取于此一自杀之内战，以自掘其坟墓！
    总之，今日中国和平民主则新生，独裁内战则灭亡，和平民主为中国今日唯一出路，亦国民党反动派之唯一出路，国民党为救国自救计，实应悬崖勒马，立刻改变其错误政策，并迅与各民主党派，社会贤达，通力合作，从速促成下列各项之实施，以挽救当前之危机：
    １、重申停战命令，实现全面和平。
    ２、迅速实现三大协议，废止国民党一党专政，组织各级民主联合政府。
    ３、实践四项诺言，取缔特务机关。
    ４、向美国收回已失主权，谢绝美国军事援助，要求美军撤离中国。
    必如是，国民党始能重新取信国人，而完成其历史任务，倘不是之图，依然坚持其“卖国”内战独裁之政策，是甘愿自绝于国人，则本军全体将士，为坚持人民利益，争取国家之独立、民主、和年。争取三大协议之彻底实施，誓当与八路军新四军及全国一切民主力量并肩合作，以与反动派奋斗到底，不达目的，誓不中止，尚望我全国父老兄弟姐妹仁人志士，一致团结共同奋斗，尤望我全国军界袍泽，痛念祖国危难，洞察反动派阴谋，认识世界和平民主的潮流，毅然举行反内战起义，参加和平民主阵营，则救国即所以自救，为民亦所以为己，功罪祸福，只在一念间耳，临电迫切，无任屏营！
    民主建国军总司令高树勋
    副总司令廖安邦
    第一军军长范龙章
    第二军军长乔明礼率
    全体将士同叩
