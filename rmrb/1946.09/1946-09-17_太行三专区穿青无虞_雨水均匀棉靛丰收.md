　　Taihang Third Special District Has No Worries About Cloth Dyeing
    Uniform Rainfall Leads to Bumper Harvest of Cotton and Indigo
    [Changzhi News] The Taihang Third Special District has vigorously promoted special crops such as cotton, indigo, and Golden Queen corn this year, achieving great results. According to a recent statistic from the First Administrative Office: in the eight counties of Shexian, Wu'an, Linxian, Anyang, Tangyin, Huixian, Jiqi, and Cixian in the entire special district, the original plan was to plant 830,000 mu of cotton. Now, after deducting the minor damages caused by insects, frost, and other disasters, the harvestable area reaches 861,608 mu, exceeding the plan by more than 30,000 mu. The original plan for the five counties of Shexian, Wu'an, Cixian, Anyang, and Linxian was to plant 1,090 mu of indigo. Now, the statistics from Shexian, Wu'an, and Linxian alone reach 3,198 mu, exceeding twice the total planned amount for the five counties. This year, Shexian produced over 1,600 mu of indigo, which is more than enough for self-sufficiency. Shexian was originally allocated to plant 4,000 mu of Golden Queen corn, but actually planted 5,712 mu. Currently, the indigo has been harvested. Due to the even rainfall this summer, a bumper harvest has been achieved, with a yield of over 100 jin per mu. The dyes needed by each county can now be largely or partially self-supplied. Cotton is currently being topped, with abundant cotton bolls. Golden Queen corn also has strong stalks and large ears, promising a bumper harvest. Furthermore, indigo in Wuxiang and other places has also achieved a bumper harvest. Baihe Village in Wuxiang planted 11 mu of indigo and harvested over 900 jin. Ceyu Village in the First District of Pingding planted 120 mu of indigo this year and harvested 12,000 jin, enough to supply the entire district.

　　太行三专区穿青无虞
    雨水均匀棉靛丰收
    【长治讯】太行三专区今年推广棉花、靛、金皇后等特种作物甚力，成绩亦极大。据一专署最近统计：全专区涉县、武安、林县、安阳、汤阴、辉县、汲淇、磁县等八个县，原计划种棉八十三万亩，现除因虫、冻等灾损坏少数外，可收获者即达八十六万一千六百零八亩，超过计划三万余亩。涉县、武安、磁县、安阳、林县五县，原计划种靛一千零九十亩，现仅涉县、武安、林县三县统计达三千一百九十八亩，超过了五个县总额的二倍。涉县今年靛产一千六百余亩，自给有余。金皇后玉茭涉县原分配种四千亩，实种五千七百十二亩。现各地靛已收割，由于今夏雨水调匀，均获丰收，每亩产量在百斤以上。各县染料已可大部自给，或部分自给。棉花现正摘顶，结桃累累，金皇后玉茭亦杆壮穗大，丰收可望。又武乡等地靛亦丰收，武乡白和村种靛十一亩，收九百余斤。平定一区测鱼村，今年种靛一百二十亩，收一万二千斤。可供一区全区用。
