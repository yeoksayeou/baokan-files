　　[This newspaper special dispatch] All colleagues of this newspaper and the Xinhua News Agency's Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan General Branch enthusiastically and busily welcomed the "September 1st" holiday. The General Branch began summarizing the work of the past eight months from the latter part of last month, proposing to strengthen news guidance, learn from the General Headquarters, improve business, and strengthen manuscript selection and writing as the direction for future efforts. It also issued an open letter to all branches and special correspondents for mutual encouragement. This newspaper held a newspaper work symposium on the morning of the 31st, attended by forty to fifty people. Comrade Liu Xiling, who recently came to this newspaper from the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, took the lead in introducing the experience of the Taiyue Xinhua Branch and the Taiyue Xinhua Daily. Immediately afterwards, a symposium was held on the editorial work of this newspaper since its inception. Comrades who came to the library from Beiping, Kaifeng and other places to participate in the work enthusiastically spoke, providing many opinions. It was unanimously agreed that we should respond to the call of the Liberation Daily editorial and the Central Bureau. In future work, we must be tense and responsible, and do our best to be rapid, accurate, vivid, and lively, strengthen guidance and criticism, and do our best to overcome difficulties in manpower and materials and accelerate the publishing process. It was suggested that the post office improve distribution work. The newspaper office and news agency also held a joint party on the 1st, and had a very pleasant conversation. The newspaper's printing plant also started a conservation movement and a youth worker training and promotion movement on "September 1st."
　　
　　[This newspaper Changzhi dispatch] All personnel of the Taihang Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Branch are responding to the Central Bureau's call to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic war by engaging in an in-depth New Hero Movement. All departments are enthusiastically discussing Comrade Li Xuefeng's report on the mobilization for the patriotic self-defense war and related documents, further understanding the nature, situation, and future of the civil war to improve work. Most comrades have conducted ideological self-examinations, but after the movement entered an in-depth stage, a tired thought of "take a break" arose, resulting in insufficient tension in action. Comrade Wu Yun检讨 said: "In the past, I thought that no matter how serious the situation was, we would always win, and it was right to do my job, but I didn't consider how to do my job better, so I didn't perform well enough in the face of the tense self-defense war." Comrade Li Zhengda 检讨 said: "I proposed to intensify work to welcome the self-defense patriotic war very early, but I didn't care at all, and the battle news in the newspaper seemed to have little to do with me," but now I realize it. After ideological self-examination, everyone said: "Now I am awake!" Due to the ideological awakening, everyone's mood immediately became tense. The departments checked their work plans and revised and supplemented them to make them more suitable for the requirements of the self-defense war. Some comrades decided to change their original plan to go home until after the victory of the war. Comrades also saved money and donated money to support the front line. Some donated their subsidized vegetable money until the victory of the self-defense war; some donated their savings of five hundred yuan, six hundred yuan, etc.; and some donated winter clothes, shoes, hats, and so on.

　　本报暨新华总分社纪念“九一”
    热烈座谈今后工作
    太行分社暨新华日报加紧工作支援前线
    【本报特讯】本报暨新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社全体同仁，热烈而紧张的迎接“九一”节，总分社从上月下旬即开始总结八个月来的工作，提出加强新闻指导性，向总社学习，改进业务与加强选稿和编写工作，作为今后努力方向，并发表致各分支社及特约记者的公开信共勉。本报于三十一日上午召开报纸工作座谈会，到四五十人，新从太岳新华日报来本报工作的刘希龄同志首起介绍太岳新华分社及太岳新华日报的经验，旋即座谈本报创刊以来的编辑工作，新从北平、开封等地来馆参加工作的同志们，踊跃发言，提供了许多意见，一致认为应该响应解放日报社论及中央局的号召，在今后工作中要紧张负责，尽量作到迅速、确实、生动、活泼，加强指导性与批判性，尽力克服人力物力困难，加速出版过程，建议邮局改进发行工作。一日报馆与通讯社并召开联欢大会，畅谈甚欢。本报印刷厂亦于“九一”开始节约运动和培养与提高青工运动。
    【本报长治讯】太行新华日报、新华分社全体人员正以深入新英雄运动，来响应中央局粉碎蒋介石进攻争取爱国战争胜利的号召。各部科都在热烈的讨论李雪峰同志爱国自卫战争动员的报告及有关文件，进一步认识内战性质、形势、前途等以提高工作。大部同志已作了思想检查，但运动进入深入阶段后，即产生了“休息一下”的疲惫思想，以致行动不够紧张。武蕴同志检讨说：“过去以为时局不管如何严重，总是要胜利的，自己干工作就对了，但是如何把工作作得更好，却未加考虑，因此在紧张的自卫战争面前表现不够紧张。”李正大同志检讨说：“很早就提出了加紧工作以迎接自卫爱国战争，但是我却满不在乎，看到报上的战斗消息，也好像和自己没有多大关系一样”，现在可认识了。经思想检查后，大家都说：“这一下可清醒了！”由于思想上的清醒，大家的情绪立刻紧张起来。各科纷纷检查工作计划并修正补充，使它更适合自卫战争的要求。有的同志决定把原来回家的计划改到了战争胜利以后。同志们并纷纷节约、献金，支援前线。有的捐献自己的补助菜金，直到自卫战争胜利为止；有的捐出自己的积蓄五百元、六百元不等；还有的捐献冬衣、鞋、帽等等。
