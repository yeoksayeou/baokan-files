	Handan Miscellany
	Blackboard Newspaper
	The Handan Municipal Public Education Center held a "Blackboard Newspaper Work Symposium" at the end of last month. Reporters from more than twenty blackboard newspapers in the city attended. The meeting determined that the Public Education Center would be the leading center for blackboard newspapers in the city, and established vertical and horizontal communication links, so that important news such as the military service consolation and donation publicity work in various streets could be quickly reported to the city. Attention was paid to adopting various methods, such as comics, ballads, and clapper talks, to attract readers.
	Propaganda Team
	In the past few days, Handan City has successively organized six propaganda teams, five of which were jointly formed by the Citizen's Association Children's Corps and Sisters' Corps, and the other was composed of industrial workers. With the help of comrades working in the Public Education Center, three teams have appeared in Handan City at the end of last month. More than one hundred and fifty people participated in costume performances in the three teams. They performed Yangko dances, small living newspapers, clapper talks, and speeches on major roads and street corners, making Handan City active and lively.
	Amplifier
	Starting from the evening of the 26th of last month, the voices of loudspeakers on many streets in Handan City replaced the deafening gongs and drums of the propaganda teams during the day. From there, people could hear many important news and victory messages, as well as the enthusiastic participation of various districts and other places in this city in the patriotic self-defense war to comfort the army. The front of the amplifier was crowded every night.
	"The White-Haired Girl" on Stage
	The Beida Emancipation Troupe, at the invitation of the border government and the masses, arrived in Handan a few days ago. Starting from August 31st, it will organize welcome, army comfort, and celebration of the emancipation of the masses in Handan and other evening parties at the Handan Theater stage, and stage the giant famous opera "The White-Haired Girl." "The White-Haired Girl" has been performed more than ten times in urban and rural areas in Xingtai, Nanhe and other places; because the content is closely integrated with the current emancipation movement, the scene is tragic and moving, and it has been warmly welcomed by the masses. The troupe will stay in Handan for more than ten days, and the number of performances will be around seven.

　　邯郸集锦
    黑板报
    邯郸市民众教育馆于上月底召开“黑板报工作座谈会”，全市二十余块黑板报的记者均出席参加。会议上确定了以民教馆为全市黑板报的领导中心，且建立纵横的通讯联系，以便使各街的参军慰劳献捐宣传等工作的重要消息，迅速地报导于全市。注意采用各种方法，为漫画、歌谣、快板等，以吸引读者。
    宣传队
    最近几天邯郸市先后组织了六个宣传队，其中五个是由市民会儿童团与姐妹团合组的，另一个则是由产业工人组成。在民教馆工作同志的帮助下，已有三个队于上月底出现于邯郸市。化装参加表演的，三个队就有一百五十余人。他们在各大马路与各个街口扭秧歌，表演小型活报，说快板，演讲，使邯郸市变得活跃而热闹。
    扩音台
    从上月二十六日傍晚开始，邯郸市的许多街上，大喇叭筒的讲话声代替了白天宣传队的喧天锣鼓。从那里能听到许多重要新闻和胜利消息。以及本市各区及其他各地在爱国自卫战争中热烈参战劳军的情形。扩音台前每晚拥挤不堪。
    《白毛女》上演
    北大翻身剧团，应边府及群众邀请，已于日前抵邯郸。自八月三十一日起，即将假邯郸剧院舞台，先后组织欢迎、劳军、庆祝邯市群众翻身等晚会，上演巨型名歌剧《白毛女》。《白毛女》曾在邢台、南和一带城乡演过十场以上；因内容与目前翻身运动密切结合，场面悲愤动人，受到群众热烈欢迎。该剧团将在邯郸勾留十数日，演出次数当在七场左右云。
