Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: Shandong Liberated Area's cultural publishing industry has seen great development in the past six months. During this period, Shandong Xinhua Bookstore published 181 new books, totaling more than 760,000 copies. Book sales from the Jinan headquarters alone reached more than 5,840,000 yuan (equivalent to 100 million legal tender). Sixty percent of the readers are intellectuals, and 40 percent are farmers. The bookstores are crowded with readers all day long. The bookstore currently has two printing factories with 240 employees and six quarto printing presses, producing more than 2.5 million characters per month. Due to the implementation of a point system with graded bonuses, the workers' enthusiasm has been greatly increased. The bookstore has 84 branches and sales outlets scattered throughout the small towns and villages. To further expand outreach, the bookstore has entrusted the local cultural and educational assistants, cooperatives, and post offices to sell books on their behalf. The headquarters has a mail-order service department to purchase foreign books for readers, which in the past six months has amounted to more than 860 types, valued at more than 100 million legal tender. In business operations, the spirit of serving the people is implemented. The Rizhao branch often has three people carrying books to various rural factories and cooperatives to sell, and they frequently communicate the experiences of rural primary schools. When Pei Zonglin from the branch carries books to villages, he often uses his spare time to tell stories to the masses, which always attracts many people who buy many books. When he goes to remote villages to sell books, he also gives political lessons to the village primary school. Those who do not have money to buy books can exchange them for eggs, which has resulted in great success in business.

Xinhua News Agency, Xinkou, 15th: In the new districts of Jinbei (northern Shanxi), including the key towns of Guoxian, Shuoxian, Daixian, Ningwu, and Yuanping Qicun, Xuangang, and Daniu Dian, three middle schools have been restored with more than 900 students. There are also 22 higher primary and complete primary schools with more than 4,500 students. In the aforementioned four counties, there are still 300 rural national primary schools that are actively resuming classes. The county governments have recruited more than 300 rural intellectuals to serve as teachers in various villages. Educators who had taken refuge in mountain villages during the occupation have gladly accepted the invitations from the democratic government to serve in local national education after liberation. With the reopening of schools, Xinhua bookstores have been established in each county. The Guoxian Xinhua Bookstore received a large shipment of books, including "On Coalition Government" and "On New Democracy," which were sold out in less than two days.

    推销员深入乡村组织读者代办外版图书获群众拥护
    【新华社临沂十八日电】山东解放区文化出版事业近半年来有很大发展，山东新华书店在此期间出版新书达一百八十一种，计七十六万余册，出售书籍仅临沂总店已达五百八十四万余元（合法币一万万元）以上读者百分之六十为知识分子，百分之四十为农民群众，门市部整天挤满了读者，该店现有印刷厂两座，职工二百四十余人，四开机六架，每月排子达二百五十万以上，由于实行了按级分红的记分制度，工人积极性大大提高，该店共有分支店八十四处，分售处遍设于各地小村镇，为更加普及起见，特委托各区文教助理员、合作社、邮务所、代销书籍，总店设有邮购服务部，为读者采办外版图书，半年来已达八百六十余种，值法币一万万元以上。在营业上贯彻为人民服务的精神，日照分店经常有三个人担着书到各个乡村工厂合作社去卖，并且经常沟通各乡村小学的经验，该分店裴宗林担书到村庄时，常利用空闲向群众说书，每次总是围上好多人买去很多书。当他到偏僻村庄卖书时，还附带给村里小学上政治课，没有钱买书的可以用鸡蛋换，这样在业务上有很大收获。
