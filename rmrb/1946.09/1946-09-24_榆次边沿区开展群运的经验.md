Experiences in Carrying Out Mass Movements in the Yuchi Border Area
    Zheng Xueqiao

    The mass movement in the Yuchi border area is unprecedentedly large in scale, fierce in momentum, and comprehensive in its coverage. The following experiences have been gained:

    (1) Training a large number of activists to ignite the flames of revenge.

    The entire county concentrated more than 2,000 poor, hired, and middle peasant activists from various villages for training in various districts. Some villages sent more than 30 people. This was the spark that ignited the struggle and opened up the situation, what they called "universal rain." In the training classes, because there were so many people, they could inspire and influence each other, easily find the root of poverty, identify targets for grievances, formulate specific programs for struggle, and come up with clever methods. They could also easily see their own strength and not be individually prominent, afraid of "those who cross the river first getting their feet wet," but rather work together. It became a preview of the peasants' struggle for liberation. When they returned to their villages, they were like tigers descending from the mountains, causing a sensation. Then the peasants all followed along. Therefore, this time, villages that sent more people to the training had a better-developed movement, while those that sent fewer had less momentum. This also advanced the experience of first cultivating activists and then launching the movement and breaking through typical examples to promote the general. At the same time, in the border area, the mass movement requires speed and comprehensiveness, and everyone must work together. After universal training of activists, the movement will develop comprehensively, fiercely, and rapidly.

    (2) Removing ideological concerns and overthrowing "Little Yan Xishans."

    The biggest concern of the peasants in the border area is "overturning the blood jar," fearing that turning over would cost them their heads, fearing revenge and beheading by Yan's puppet troops "revenge teams." On this issue, ×× village proposed: "Be a sheep? Be a tiger? Sheep only have a dead end, tigers fight may not die," "Yan Xishan kills people, not because of turning over or not, mainly to grab grain and conscript soldiers. Xijianzi did not engage in struggle and killed people particularly. Dongyan is his ruling area, and he killed 47 people at once and snatched a lot of livestock and grain." ××× village summarized last year's lessons in three points: 1. Compromise leads to being defeated one by one; 2. Not contacting superiors leads to isolated struggle; 3. Disunity, failing to overthrow "Little Yan Xishans." As long as everyone is of one mind, there are many people and great strength, and much firewood makes a high flame, digging up Yan Xishan's roots and knocking down his eyes and ears. The traitors, secret agents, and local bullies of Yuchi are "Little Yan Xishans" who hold three positions in one and are most hated by the people. Now, a movement to overthrow "Little Yan Xishans" has been widely launched.

    (3) "Authorize the peasants" and approve the peasants' reasonable demands and actions.

    When the peasants rise up to struggle, they demand support and that their actions be legalized, asking whether they dare to do this? Dare to do that? The leadership must boldly agree to them, "authorize the peasants," so that they feel they are the masters and act boldly. Capture the ringleader first, targeting the big traitors and bully landlords, first control the back door and give them a blow to the prestige. In front of the enemy and puppet bullies, shout "This is the world of the poor grandfathers!" creating a fiery atmosphere of peasants complaining and settling accounts, so that the vast number of peasants, even middle and small landlords, rich peasants, women, and children, are also swept into this wave, surging and rushing towards the enemy and puppet remnants. Others with fewer crimes will quickly bow their heads. Only in this way can we establish peasant leading cadres, master the wooden mallet (seal), overthrow the rule of those "cadres who have traveled all over the earth" (cadres who have worked for the enemy, Yan, and us) and "Little Yan Xishans," create a peasant advantage, and establish our own political power, our own organization—the Peasants' Association, and our own armed forces—the militia, laying a solid foundation for the patriotic self-defense guerrilla war.

    (4) Mobilizing the masses, arming the masses, small strike surface, large benefit surface.

    Under the frequent harassment of Yan's puppets, the "revenge team" was stationed in Nanyao and Beiheliu, specializing in destroying the mass movement. The masses had to run for an average of six hours a day, and the threat of war was great, making the masses' emotions easily volatile. They combined armed struggle with the development of the movement: 1. Implementing mass large-scale martial law, "relying on ourselves to defend ourselves," strengthening sentry intelligence, burying grain, placing livestock, organizing women and children to retreat, clearing up household registration, organizing five-family joint security, countering rumors and pursuing secret agents, organizing militia to carry out guerrilla warfare and blasting campaigns, using arms against arms. Without the Peasants' Association pass, no one is allowed to enter or leave the village. Sentries are posted in front of the village, and meetings are being brewed in the village to complain and settle accounts. As soon as the enemy situation comes, they immediately transfer. 2. Few people come forward, but many people do things. The chairman of the meeting, the liquidation committee, etc., are represented by one or two people, but the more people who actually do things, the better, which can both promote democracy and facilitate concealment. 3. Small strike surface and large benefit surface. Only strike at those who are extremely guilty, aim accurately and strike hard, let some secondary ones wash their faces and wipe off the black, and consider it done after liquidation. In the distribution of the fruits of struggle, the surface should be wide, and after obtaining the fruits, stamp blood prints and swear not to expose or submit. 4. At the beginning of the struggle, the peasants demanded the replacement of cadres who were not of one mind, demanded weapons, attacked Yan's puppet "revenge team," and defended themselves. The leadership should immediately seize this demand, organize the militia, protect the fruits of the mass struggle, and completely turn over.

    (5) Reasonable and rapid distribution of the fruits of struggle.

    In addition to a wide surface (Zhuangzi has achieved 70% to 80%), which can unite the broad masses, the distribution of the fruits of struggle should also be done quickly and fully, fight one and distribute one, distribute as you fight, to avoid losses; if unfairness is found, make appropriate adjustments next time. If there is a situation where the fruits have not been distributed, they should be carried and kept separately, or transferred to a safe place for redistribution. Some villages have kicked away the issue of who benefits from whom, and the peasants put forward demands and distribute according to their own needs. Therefore, during distribution, appropriate care is given to each person's needs. The very poor, anti-Japanese families, middle peasants, elderly, women, and children are given what they need. Some things can be distributed in groups. In Nanqiaotou, Wang Daoxu's livestock was distributed to four families, and Wang Yuzhang's new courtyard has been distributed to three poor peasant families and one hired worker. After the struggle, the general peasants have smashed the tablets of the God of Wealth and no longer believe that the God of Wealth can make a fortune. They have regarded Chairman Mao as the living Bodhisattva of liberation.

　　榆次边沿区开展群运的经验
    郑雪樵
    榆次边地群运规模空前宏大，来势猛烈，普及全面，获得如下几点经验：
    （一）大量训练积极层，点起复仇的火焰
    全县把各村的贫、雇、中农积极层，在各区集中训练了二千多人，有的一个村就去了三十多人，这是打开斗争局面、掀起运动的火种，拿他们的话叫做“普雨”。在训练班里，由于人多，可以互相启发，互相影响，容易找出穷根，诉出对象，制出斗争具体纲领，想出巧妙办法，也容易看见自己力量，不致个人突出，不怕“先过河先湿脚”，而是要干一齐干，成了农民翻身斗争的预演，他们回到村里，便像猛虎下山一样，轰动起来，接着农民就都跟着一起行动。有些在训练班是落后分子，但一回到村里便成了积极分子去联络人。所以这次凡是参加训练人多的村庄，运动就开展得好，少的劲头就不大。这样也就把先培养积极分子，然后开展运动和突破典型、推动一般的经验提高一步。同时，在边地，群运要求快、全面，要干一齐干，经过积极层普训，运动是会全面猛烈迅速开展起来的。
    （二）解除思想顾虑，打掉“小阎锡山”
    边地农民最大顾虑是“倒血罐”，怕翻身把脑袋翻掉，怕阎伪军“复仇队”报复杀头。在这个问题上，××村提出：“当绵羊？当老虎？绵羊只有死路一条，老虎搏斗未必死”，“阎锡山杀人，不在翻身不翻身，主要是抢粮抓丁，西见子没有搞斗争杀人杀的特别多，东鄢是他统治的地区，一下就杀死四十七个人，抢走好多牲口和粮食”。×××村总结去年教训有三点：一、妥协了被人家各个击破；二、没有和上级联系，斗争孤立；三、不团结，没有打掉“小阎锡山”。只要大家一条心，人多力量大，柴多火焰高，挖了阎锡山的根，打掉他的耳目，顽军来时，给他一个迎头痛击。榆次的汉奸、特务、恶霸是一身而三任的“小阎锡山”，最为人民所痛恨，现在已普遍开展打倒“小阎锡山”运动。
    （三）“授权与农民”，批准农民合理的要求和行动
    当农民起来斗争时，要求给他撑腰，要求他的行动合法化，问敢不敢这？敢不敢那？领导上必须大胆的答应他们，“授权与农民”，让他们感到自己是主人翁，大胆行动起来。擒贼先擒王，对准大汉奸、恶霸地主，先扣后门，来个下马威。在敌伪恶霸面前，高呼“这是穷爷爷的天下”！造成农民诉苦清算的烈火，使广大农民，甚至中小地主富农、妇女儿童，也都卷入这个浪潮，汹涌澎湃，冲向敌伪残余势力，其他罪恶较少的也就很快便低了头。唯有这样，才能树立起农民领导骨干，掌握了木圪塔（印），把那些“走遍地球干部”（做过敌、阎、我的干部）和“小阎锡山”的统治打垮，造成农民优势，建立起自己的政权，自己的组织——农会，自已的武装——民兵，打下爱国自卫游击战争的坚实基础。
   （四）发动群众，武装群众，打击面小，得利面大
    在阎伪频繁袭扰下，“复仇队”驻在南要、北合流，专门破坏群运，群众每天平均要跑六小时，战争威胁很大，群众情绪容易动荡。他们结合了武装斗争，开展了运动：一、实行群众性大戒严，要“靠自己保卫自己”，加强岗哨情报坐探，埋藏粮食，安放牲口，组织妇女儿童退却，清查户口，组织五家连环保，反谣言追特务，组织民兵开展游击战和爆炸运动，以武装对武装。没有农会条子，一律不准进村出村，村前放哨，村里酝酿开会诉苦，敌情一来，随即转移。二、出面人少办事人多，开会当主席、清算委员会等，由一两个人出面，实际办事的人则越多越好，既能发扬民主，又好隐蔽。三、打击面小，得利面要大，只打击罪大恶极的，瞅的准打得狠，让一些次要的洗脸擦黑，清算了就算完事。在分配斗争果实上，面要宽，得果实后盖血印，宣誓不暴露不屈服。四、农民在斗争一开始，就要求撤换不一心干部，要求武器，打击阎伪“复仇队”，保卫自身，领导上应立即抓住这一要求，组织民兵，保卫群众斗争果实，彻底翻身。
    （五）合理、迅速分配斗争果实
    分配斗争果实，除面要宽（庄子已做到百分之七十到八十），可以团结广大群众外，还要做到快分全分，斗一个分一个，随斗随分，以免损失；如发现不公道，下次再适当调剂，如果实未分配有了情况，便分头携带保管，或转移到安全地再分。有些村庄已踢开谁的问题谁得利，由农民按自己需要提出要求分，因此，分配时按各人的需要适当照顾。赤贫抗属、中农、老年人、妇女、儿童各分给需要的东西。有些东西可以伙分，在南桥头王道恤的牲口分了四家，王玉章的新院，已分给三家贫农、一个雇工。经过斗争后，一般农民已打碎财神的牌位，不再相信财神能发财，已把毛主席当成翻身的活菩萨。
