Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Shanghai News: Mr. Liang Shuming, an executive member of the China Democratic League, criticized the Kuomintang government's handling of the Li-Wen case at a press conference in Shanghai on the 25th of last month, saying: I can use the word "hesitation" to criticize it. The following points are sufficient to prove this: (1) Only the Wen case was brought out of the two assassinations, which is "spitting out," while the Li case was not mentioned, which is "swallowing." (2) The murderers of Wen Yiduo were first ××, then blamed on the local authorities, and finally had to admit that they were two low-ranking officers of the Kunming Garrison Command, which is "spitting out"; but they also said that Wen Yiduo was a "traitor" and therefore assassinated, and that it had nothing to do with others. Here, the reason for the assassination and the masterminds behind the assassination are "swallowed" again. (3) The so-called public trial on August 15 only allowed the designated reporters from the Central News Agency to participate, which is "spitting out," while refusing reporters from Ta Kung Pao and any other reporters to listen, which is "swallowing" again. (4) The trial record was read out publicly after the "public trial" on the 15th, and the murderers also signed and approved it, which is "spitting out," but the verdict was not announced on the 15th. I (Liang claimed) asked Gu Zhutong for a copy of the confession, but he refused. When asked if he wanted to try again, he could not answer yes or no." Liang continued: He collected a large number of witnesses in Kunming during the investigation. The witnesses included members of the China Democratic League, the vast number of young people, personnel from the Garrison Command, special elements, and the materials they provided. Based on these materials, it can be pointed out that there are several flaws in the government's handling of this case, but now I am afraid that the government will use these materials to revise the confession and make up for the flaws, so we are not willing to publish them yet, but a written report will be available soon.

　　梁漱溟抨击蒋政府
    处理李闻案“吞吞吐吐”
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：民盟执委梁漱溟在上月二十五日沪记者招待会上抨击国民党政府处理李闻案之经过称：我可以用“吞吞吐吐”四个字批评它。有下列诸端足资证明：（一）两件暗杀只拿出一件闻案，这是“吐”，而李案不提这是“吞”。（二）杀闻凶手先是××继固推地方，最后不得不承认是昆明警备司令部的两个中下级军官，这是“吐”；但他们又说闻一多是“卖国贼”故刺杀之，与他人无关，这里又“吞”去了暗杀原因及暗杀主谋者。（三）八月十五日的所谓公审只许指定的中央社二记者参加，这是“吐”，而拒绝大公报记者及其他任何一个记者旁听，这又是“吞”。（四）审判记录在十五日“公审”后当众宣读，凶手亦画押认可，这是“吐”，但十五日并未宣判。我（梁氏自称）向顾祝同要一份口供，他拒绝了，问他还要审否，他答不出是、否。”梁氏继称：他在昆明调查搜集有大批人证，人证包括民盟、广大青年、警备部人员、特种分子与他们提供的材料，根据这些材料，可以指出政府承办此案的若干破绽，但现在恐怕政府利用这些材料来修改口供弥补破绽，故吾人尚不愿发表，但不久当有书面报告。
