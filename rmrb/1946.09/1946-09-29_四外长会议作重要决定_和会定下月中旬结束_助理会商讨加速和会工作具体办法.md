　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Paris dispatch: The four major powers' foreign ministers, after meeting for four hours on the 24th, made an important decision. This decision was communicated by French Foreign Minister Bidault to the Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, Mr. du Bac, urging that the final reports of the various committees of the Peace Conference should be submitted by October 5th, so that the plenary session can discuss them, and the final vote of the General Assembly on all issues should be held on October 15th. Bidault also suggested that the speaking time and number of speeches of the delegates at the Peace Conference should be limited, in order to conclude in time and not hinder the United Nations General Assembly to be held in New York on October 23rd. After receiving Bidault's notification, du Bac will determine the date of the next plenary session of the Peace Conference for the General Assembly to discuss this proposal. A meeting of the assistants to the four major powers' foreign ministers was held yesterday, aiming to finalize the specific methods determined by the four foreign ministers to accelerate the work of the Peace Conference. It is also learned that the four foreign ministers' meeting also made the following decision, that before the final decision on the fate of the Italian colonies is made, discussions should be held with all relevant governments participating in the African war (including the four Dominions of the British Commonwealth and the five major powers). Bevin returned to London for the third time yesterday after the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. His first time was on August 24th, and the second time was on September 7th. After returning to Paris from London in the previous two times, he initiated the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
