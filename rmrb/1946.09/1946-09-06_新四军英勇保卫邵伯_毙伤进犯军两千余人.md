Xinhua News Agency, Yangtai Front, September 2nd: Our Yang (zhou) Tai (zhou) front line accompanying reporter reports the course of the victorious defense of Shaobo as follows: Shaobo is located on the Grand Canal, forty or so li northeast of Yangzhou, and is a vital point for military transportation on the southern side of the Suwan liberated area. At 5:00 AM on August 23rd, the long-plotting Chiang army's 25th Division (military designation changed) artillery battalion and its subordinate 40th Brigade, 108th Brigade, and 148th Brigade (all brigades redesignated from divisions), a total of three brigades, coordinated with twelve gunboats, five airplanes, and over thirty large and small artillery pieces including American and Japanese-made rocket launchers, advancing by land and water from Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, and jointly invading in the direction of Shaobo. The 108th Brigade invaded Shaobo from Xiannvmiao (thirty li northeast of Yangzhou), once advancing to Yangqiao, two li from Shaobo. The 148th Brigade, aboard multiple gunboats and motorboats, advanced west from the west of Shaobo, spying on Shaobo, and the 40th Brigade simultaneously moved out from both Zhuanqiao (thirty-five li southeast of Shaobo) and Xiannvmiao, attacking Qiaomo (ten li east of Shaobo) in three routes, occupying the town. The aforementioned enemy troops have been routed under the heroic resistance of the New Fourth Army. The Chiang army attacking Shaobo head-on occupied Yangqiao, and the New Fourth Army engaged in hand-to-hand combat, annihilating the majority of the Chiang army and recovering the area. Huang Boao, the commander of the 25th Division (formerly the 25th Army), who had "guaranteed" to capture Shaobo in a few days, was greatly alarmed upon hearing the news in Xiannvmiao and transferred his most elite 40th Brigade to the Shaobo front on the 26th. The battle situation was extremely fierce that day. The New Fourth Army calmly responded to the battle, waiting for the Chiang army to approach before jumping out of the fortifications and inflicting heavy casualties with hand grenades and bayonets. By 5:00 PM, the Chiang army, under the cover of airplanes, retreated in defeat. The New Fourth Army took advantage of the victory to recover Qiaomo, completely restoring the positions before August 23rd. In this battle, over two thousand Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, four gunboats and fifteen small boats were destroyed, and two steamships and other military supplies were captured.

　　新四军英勇保卫邵伯  毙伤进犯军两千余人
    【新华社扬泰前线二日电】本社扬（州）泰（州）前线随军记者报导邵伯胜利保卫战经过如下：邵伯在扬州东北四十余里运河线上，为苏皖解放区南面军事交通之要冲。八月二十三日五时，蓄谋已久之蒋军二十五师（军改称）炮兵营及所属四十旅、一○八旅、一四八旅（均为师改称）三个旅全部配合炮舰十二艘，飞机五架及美日造火箭炮等各种大小炮卅余门，由扬州仙女庙水陆进兵，分路向邵伯方向联合进犯。其一○八旅自仙女庙（扬州东北卅里）进犯邵伯东南，一度进至距邵伯二里之洋桥。一四八旅分乘炮舰及汽艇多艘，自邵伯渡西进窥邵伯，四十旅自砖桥（邵伯东南卅五里）及仙女庙两地同时出动，分三路进攻乔墨（邵伯东十里余），侵占该镇。上述各路敌军在新四军英勇抵抗下已遭到溃败。正面攻击邵伯之蒋军侵占洋桥，新四军与之展开白刃肉搏，将蒋军大部歼灭，并恢复该地。曾“保证”不日攻下邵伯的二十五师（原二十五军）师长黄伯廒在仙女庙闻讯大惊，二十六日将其最精锐之四十旅调至邵伯正面，是日战况至为激烈。新四军沉着应战，待蒋军接近时，从工事中跃出，以手榴弹刺刀予以重大杀伤。至五时，蒋军在飞机掩护下溃退。新四军乘胜收复乔墨，完全恢复二十三日以前阵地。是役毙伤蒋军二千余，击毁炮舰四艘及小艇十五艘，缴获汽船二艘及其他军用品。
