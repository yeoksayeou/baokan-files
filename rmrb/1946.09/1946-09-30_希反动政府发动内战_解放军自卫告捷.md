　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th】 The entire Greek army has been deployed to Thessaly in the north to fight against the army led by the National Liberation Front. The Greek government forces are using aircraft and tanks. According to TASS, the royalist government is arming right-wing terrorists to oppose left-wing elements. These bandits are led by Surlas, who was once sentenced to death but released, and are actively operating in Thessaly, burning the houses of prominent left-wing figures and assassinating democrats. After Greece held a so-called plebiscite on September 1st to decide on the return of the King, the various parties of the Greek National Liberation Front organized movements to oppose this reactionary measure. The Greek reactionary government was extremely frightened by this and re-announced the implementation of a state of emergency on the 9th of this month, and arranged to launch a military offensive against the areas in the north where the National Liberation Front has the upper hand. This civil war has an international background. The American aircraft carrier Roosevelt "visited" Greece in September, and the British Mediterranean Fleet also inspected Greece on the 22nd. Democratic figures in Athens believe that the Greek reactionary government's launch of a civil war is a reckless attempt to salvage its ruling crisis.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th】 Athens dispatch: According to the local government information bureau, on the 21st, the Greek National Liberation Army fought with pro-government garrison troops in Deska (located 30 miles northwest of Larissa) for 15 hours. The Liberation Army defeated the government troops and occupied the area. The bureau's information also stated that the government had rushed troops to the village of Lisouri, which had been occupied by left-wing troops, to launch a full-scale attack in order to destroy their main force before the King's return (according to the Associated Press on the 26th, the King will secretly return from London within 24 hours). It is said that the left-wing troops there are adopting guerrilla tactics, with left-wing elements grazing sheep in the fields everywhere during the day, and gathering together at night to launch night attacks on the punitive forces.

　　希反动政府发动内战
　　解放军自卫告捷
    【新华社延安二十六日电】希腊全部军队已开到北部的希撒利，对民族解放阵线领导的军队作战，希政府军使用飞机及坦克。又据塔斯社称：保皇党政府正在武装右翼恐怖分子，以反对左翼分子，这班匪徒为曾经判处死刑而又被释放者索尔拉斯所领导在希撒利积极活动，焚毁著名左冀分子的房屋及暗杀民主分子。希腊自九月一日举行所谓复决决定希王回国后，希腊民族阵线各政党即纷纷组织反对这一反动措施的运动，希反动政府对此极为恐惧，乃于本月九日起重行宣布实施紧急戒严，并布置向北部民族解放阵线占优势地区发动军事进攻。这一内战有其国际背景，美国罗斯福号航空母舰于九月“拜访”希腊，英地中海舰队二十二日亦巡视希腊。雅典民主人士认为希反动政府发动内战，乃图挽回其统治危机的冒险之举。
    【新华社延安二十七日电】雅典讯：据此间政府情报局称：二十一日希腊民族解放军与亲政府的守军在德斯卡（该地在拉里沙西北三十英里）作战十五小时，解放军击败政府军并占领该地。该局情报又称：政府已赶派军队前往被左派军队占领的里素理村，发动全面攻击，以便在希王回国时（据合众社二十六日称：希王将于二十四小时内秘密自伦敦返国）能摧毁其主力。据称该处左派部队采用游击战术，白天在各处耕地放羊的左派分子，到晚上集合起来向讨伐军进行夜袭。
