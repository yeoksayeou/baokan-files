Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th: The Harbin Provisional People's Congress, the Chamber of Commerce, and figures from all walks of life have expressed unanimous anger at the Kuomintang reactionaries' use of cults to conspire to create riots in Harbin. Li Jun, Speaker of the Harbin Provisional People's Congress, said, "This despicable and shameless crime by the Kuomintang reactionaries is an insult to the Chinese nation and completely exposes their ugliness." Speaker Li praised the democratic government's execution of the three criminals while adopting a lenient approach towards those who were coerced into participating, giving them a path to self-renewal, calling it "a wise policy supported by the people." Mr. Sun Guangting, an elderly member of the Provisional People's Congress, said, "In the past, I raised the issue with Mo Dehui that the Kuomintang's establishment of armies everywhere was a scourge for the people. I never expected this scourge to occur in Harbin." Xu Xinzhi, Vice President of the Chamber of Commerce, said, "Jiang Pengfei, this great traitor, is a veteran of three dynasties. He was a Major General under the Japanese, a Lieutenant General under Wang Jingwei, and now a Commander under Chiang Kai-shek, harming the people. His death is truly deserved."

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th: After the traitors Jiang Pengfei, Li Mingxin, and Cui Dagang were executed, the people were exceedingly pleased. Harbin newspapers have been using extensive space to disclose the details of the Jiang case and various pieces of evidence, and have published commentaries for days. The Songjiang Provincial Commercial Daily, under the title "Questioning Chiang Kai-shek from the Execution of Traitor Jiang Pengfei," expressed deep hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's crime of colluding with remnants of the enemy and puppets and using superstitious groups to massacre the people of Northeast China. When the traitors Jiang and others were executed during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the execution ground was crowded with countless people who hated the traitor Jiang and others, who had brought disaster to the country and the people, so much that they wished they could sleep on their skins and eat their flesh. One person pointed at Jiang's head and cursed, "This great traitor never thought he would die before our eyes." Some pointed at the corpses of the three traitors and said angrily, "Serves them right!" Someone said, "Chiang Kai-shek should be made to see this today."

    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】姜鹏飞、李明信、崔大刚三逆伏法后，人心大快。哈市各报连日以大量篇幅披露姜案详情及各种证件，并发表评论。松江省商报“从姜逆鹏飞伏法质问蒋介石”为题，对蒋介石勾结敌伪残余利用迷信团体屠杀东北人民的罪行表示深恶痛绝。当中秋节姜逆等伏法时，刑场内拥挤着无数的人群，对祸国殃民大汉奸姜逆等恨不得寝其皮食其肉，一个群众指着姜逆的头咒骂着：“这个大汉奸想不到能死在咱们眼前。”有的指着三逆尸体愤恨的说：“活该”。有人说：“今天要让蒋介石来看看才好。”
