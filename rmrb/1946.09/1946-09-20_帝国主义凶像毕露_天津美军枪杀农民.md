Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 17th: Tianjin News: Less than three days after U.S. soldiers in Beiping shot and killed Fuzhong Middle School student Cao Guiming, another incident of U.S. soldiers shooting and killing civilians occurred in Tianjin. A farmer named He Wanshun was harvesting crops near the U.S. military barracks in Tianjin on the 6th when he was discovered by a U.S. military sentry, who immediately opened fire, killing him on the spot.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 15th: Beiping News: According to extremely incomplete newspaper materials, in August, U.S. military vehicles caused eight accidents in Beiping, killing seven people and injuring one. Specifically: on August 2nd, Zhang Jixian, a colonel section chief of the Eleventh War Zone Political Department, was killed; on the 5th, a civilian, Li Changpu, was injured; on the 9th, two young girls, Chang Lianjing and Zhang Yingzhao, were hit; on the 12th, Yang Wei's wife was killed; on the 22nd, Old Wen's wife was killed; and on the 23rd, Li Yaochang, a member of the Third Precinct police, and Xia Yuping, a duty soldier of the 21st Division Political Department of the 92nd Army, were killed. U.S. military vehicles are constantly causing accidents, but there is never any punishment. The families of those killed simply bury the bodies and that is the end of the matter. The Kuomintang government turns a blind eye to this, and even the death of officer Zhang Jixian was not even announced at the time.

　　帝国主义凶像毕露
    天津美军枪杀农民
    【新华社延安十七日电】天津讯：北平美兵枪杀辅中学生曹桂明为时未及三日，津市又有美军枪杀市民事件发生。缘有农民何万顺者，六日在津市美兵营附近收割田禾，被美军岗哨发现，即开枪射击，当场毙命。
    【新华社延安十五日电】北平讯：根据报纸极不完全材料，八月份美军汽车在平肇事八起，撞死七人伤一人。计八月二日撞死十一战区政治部上校科长张及先，五日撞伤市民李长普，九日撞犯幼女常连静、张英昭二人，十二日撞死杨魏氏，二十二日撞死老温氏，二十三日撞死警察三分局局员李耀昌及九十二军二十一师政治部勤务兵夏雨屏二人。美军汽车不断肇事，而从来惩办，被撞死者由其家人埋敛即告了事。国民党政府对此更熟视无睹，甚至军官张及先之死，当时都未必发表消息。
