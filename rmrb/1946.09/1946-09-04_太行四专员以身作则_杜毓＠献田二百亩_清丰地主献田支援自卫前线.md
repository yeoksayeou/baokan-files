　　[Our newspaper, Changzhi, 2nd dispatch] Border Region Government Committee Member and Taihang Fourth Commissioner Du Yu dedicates more than 200 mu of land to help the masses to turn over. In a letter to the responsible comrades of the Bo'ai County Party Committee, County Head, and County Farmers' Association, Commissioner Du stated: "In the past, people generally thought that my family was a family of scholars, fair and kind, and had done nothing to offend the masses, but on careful consideration, this is definitely not the case. My family's food and clothing all come from the blood and sweat of the peasants, and we have supported the feudal exploitation system, owing a great debt to the peasants; in order to compensate for the peasants' losses and help the masses to thoroughly turn over, I am willing to dedicate all of the more than 200 mu of land owned by my family for the peasants to cultivate." Commissioner Du's move has aroused widespread praise from all walks of life in northern Henan, and the masses are all saying: "The Eighth Route Army people always do what they say!"
　　[Our newspaper, Heze, 2nd dispatch] After investigation in Qingfeng County, the broad masses of poor peasants have obtained land, and the majority of peasants have joined the Farmers' Association. Within two months, according to statistics from twelve villages including Qianzhanglu and Luojia Village, 311 poor peasant households and 95 poor families of revolutionary martyrs have obtained a total of 3,200 mu of land. The landlord of Xiyangshao Village, in order to evade burdens, distributed 377 mu of land to the peasants, which has all been changed to perpetual deeds. Together with the 163 mu of land voluntarily dedicated by the landlord, all 85 poor peasant households and families of revolutionary martyrs in the village have obtained a total of 540 mu of land, and middle peasants have also redeemed 163 mu. In Qianzhanglu Village in the Eighth District, 47 poor families of revolutionary martyrs have each obtained 2 mu of land, and 45 poor peasant households have each obtained 1.5 mu of land, eliminating extreme poverty. In the Beidi Village in the Fourth District, landlords dedicated land to poor families of revolutionary martyrs for cultivation in order to oppose the civil war. Landlord Meng Guangxi said: "The Eighth Route Army drove away the Japanese, and now it is defending the liberated areas. I dedicate 15 mu of land to support the front line and defeat the Kuomintang's attack!" The landlords of the entire village dedicated a total of 117 mu of land, and 21 families of revolutionary martyrs and poor peasants obtained land. After investigation in Lizhijicun Village in the Fifth District, after the masses obtained land, the various organizations in the village expanded even further. In five days, the membership of the Farmers' Association increased from 54 to 133, including 72 middle peasants. The Women's Association increased from 146 to 204, and 80 children enthusiastically enrolled in school.
