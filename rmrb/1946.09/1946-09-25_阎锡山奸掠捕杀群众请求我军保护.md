　　[Changzhi Dispatch from this Newspaper, 18th] Yan Xishan organized the so-called "Soldier-Farmer Unity Vanguard Group," attempting to turn all peaceful people into regular soldiers to replenish the significant losses from the civil war. The people in the area, unwilling to be cannon fodder in the civil war, resisted using various methods. Yan then began a frenzied conscription last month. In villages such as Hujiazhuang and Shangzhuang, 42 people were recently arrested under the pretext of attending a meeting. When Hougou Village was surrounded and searched, only old men were left. As a result, only four people were captured, and women and elderly from five other families were also arrested as hostages, forcing them to hand over young men. During the search for young men, Yan's puppet troops committed all kinds of rapes and plunder. Local people, with their families, continuously fled to our liberated areas. Many villages requested protection from our army, and would report and request rescue whenever Yan's puppet troops conscripted soldiers. On the 11th of this month, Yan's puppet troops conscripted 11 people in Miaogou Village and seized 12 shi of grain. They were intercepted by our army halfway, and five people were rescued.

　　阎锡山奸掠捕杀群众请求我军保护
    【本报长治十八日电】阎锡山组织所谓“兵农合一先锋团”企图把所有和平人民均变成常备兵，以补充内战的重大损失，该区人民不愿充内战炮灰，用各种方法抵抗，阎乃在上月开始疯狂抓丁，平定胡家庄，上庄等村，最近被以开会为名抓走四十二人，后沟村被包围搜索时，只剩下老汉，结果只抓走四人，另五家之妇女老人亦被捕为人质，迫其交出壮丁，在搜捕壮丁中阎伪军奸淫抢掠无所不为。当地人民举家向我解放区逃难者，络绎不绝，许多村庄要求我军保护，一有阎伪军抓丁即来报告请救。本月十一日阎伪军在庙沟村抓丁十一名，抢粮十二石。即被我军半途截击，救下五名。
