　　Bomb Factory Launches Shock Production Drive
　　Completes Three Months' Task in Two Months
    [Another Dispatch] The Taihang Bomb Factory is rushing to produce munitions to oppose the civil war army. In two months, it has already completed three months' production task. Recently, at a mobilization meeting of workers from all industries in the city, it proposed a revolutionary competition to all factories, deciding to complete five months of production tasks in the next three months (calculated at a standard of 10,000 pieces per month). It also guarantees to improve quality, with each person increasing voluntary labor by sixteen hours per week. The Xinhua Paper Mill accepted the challenge from the Bomb Factory and proposed a competition to all factories in the city. Their challenge letter reads: "We will complete three months of production tasks in September and October, producing 1,296 reams of hemp paper, and guarantee that every sheet is usable. We will strive to save 903.5 catties of raw materials. We will produce an additional 42,800 sheets of paper. We will improve our skills at work, intensify our studies during work breaks, study technology, and work an extra four hours every Sunday."
