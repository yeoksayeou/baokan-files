Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 31st: General Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation recently sent a cable to Marshall protesting to the U.S. government regarding the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek concerning the transfer of surplus materials. The cable stated: "I have learned from my last meeting with you and other sources that Mr. Petersen, representatives of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission and the Navy Department are currently in Shanghai discussing the final arrangements for the disposal of U.S. surplus property with senior Chinese government officials, estimated to be between 350 million and 500 million U.S. dollars. Due to the very low discount rate, the actual value is many times higher. I have also inquired that the Chinese government is considering sharing China's airspace rights with the United States in exchange for a more favorable discount rate and the convenience of shipping these transferred materials on U.S. ships. Given that the wartime materials previously given to China by the United States have been fully utilized by the Chinese government to conduct civil war, and this civil war is still in full swing, handing over surplus materials at this time is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, and the result may undermine any final attempt to control the war. Although it is not yet possible to determine whether there are munitions in this transfer, these materials are undoubtedly military supplies, which will greatly increase the government's potential for combat operations. Therefore, I am authorized to protest to the U.S. government regarding the current negotiations on surplus materials. I must also emphasize that the CCP will never accept the results of such negotiations. If the Sino-U.S. governments still conclude an agreement of this nature, serious consequences will be immediately apparent, and the U.S. government cannot shirk its share of responsibility for these consequences, and the outcome of this negotiation will have a very serious impact on your efforts to promote peace. I urge you to use your influence to obtain the U.S. government's consent to postpone the negotiations until China's peace and unified coalition government is fully guaranteed."

　　周恩来同志电马歇尔
    抗议美蒋物资谈判
    强调声明中共断不接受谈判结果
    【新华社南京三十一日电】中共代表团周恩来将军于日前致电马歇尔，对于美蒋正在进行中的转移剩余物资的谈判向美国政府提出抗议。该电称：“自上次与阁下会谈之中及其他方面得悉，彼特森先生、美国对外清算委员会及海军部代表现在上海正与中国政府高级官员商谈美国剩余财产处理之最后办法，据估计在三万万五千万至五万万金元之间，由于其折价甚低，则其实际价值更高出若干倍。我并问及中国政府正考虑从中国的领空权与美国分享，以求换得更有利之折扣率以及由美船运送此项移交物资之便利。鉴于过去美国交与中国之战时物资曾经中国政府充分使用以进行内战，而此内战尚在全力进行中，在此时交出剩余物资，实等于火上加油，其结果可破坏任何对战争予以控制之最后企图。现虽尚不能断定此次移交其中有无军火，但此等物资乃属军用物资无疑，故必致大为增加政府之作战潜在力。因此，我受权为目前进行的剩余物资之谈判，向美国政府提出抗议。我并须特别强调声明：“中共断不能接受此种谈判的结果。设中美政府仍订立如此性质之协定，则即可立见严重的后果，而美国政府亦不能推脱其对此后果所应负的一部分责任，且此谈判之结果必将极严重的影响你对促成和平的努力。我要求你利用你的影响获得美国政府的同意，把谈判拖延到中国的和平及统一的联合政府有了充分的保障以后再谈。”
