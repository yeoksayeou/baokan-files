　　Land-Reformed Peasants Vow to Defend Their Homes
　　Jinnan Youths Enlist in the Third Batch
　　Fifty Demobilized Soldiers Return to the Battlefield
　　Qixian's Han Cheng'er Brothers Join the Army Together
　　Three People with One Heart Turn Yellow Earth into Gold; The People with One Heart Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's Army

　　[Our Newspaper Weixian Dispatch on the 27th] In Jinnan, another 1,700+ land-reformed peasants have joined the army. This is the third batch in the past month. Additionally, 50 demobilized soldiers have returned to the battlefield. 120 militiamen from the Second and Third Districts of Jixian County, led by Lu Zhuangzhen, Director of the Armed Committee of the Second District, went to the eastern Yun front together. Eight Communist Party members in Majiying Village, Yongnian, led five masses to join the army, and thirteen militiamen collectively enlisted. Old Qiu, who is over forty years old, said, "I can't be a soldier, but I am willing to be a cook to cook for the brothers who are fighting Chiang's bandits." Within a month, Renxian County has had 120 young people join the army. At the anti-civil war meeting in the First District, seven village cadres acted as the locomotives for joining the army. They said, "Three people with one heart turn yellow earth into gold; The people with one heart eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's army. If Old Chiang comes, we poor people won't survive anyway, so we have to fight him to the death." Three hundred women earnestly said at the rally to send off the new soldiers, "Go to the front with peace of mind! We will guarantee that your parents, children, and wives have clothes to wear and help you spin and weave." They also gave the new soldiers many shoes, socks, and clothes on the spot. In the past few days, nearly 140 young people in Daming have enlisted again. Su Xiaoyin, the head of the border village self-defense force in the Third District, led 30 militiamen to collectively sign up for the army. Women's Federation members in the village have also persuaded their mothers-in-law and mobilized their husbands. In Wucheng, 69 young people joined the army in five days. All villages held "thinking meetings," and the political awareness of the masses has been greatly improved, so joining the army has become a warm mass movement. Enlistment competitions have been widely launched in various places, and the fourth batch of enlistees will soon go to the battlefield.

　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi Dispatch on the 26th] After the masses in Qixian County were emancipated, they asked to arm themselves to defend their homes. Recently, the county has set off a surge of joining the army. The first batch of more than one hundred young people has poured into the Independent Battalion. Han Cheng'er and Han San'er, brothers from Xinsai Village, painfully recalled the suffering they had endured when herding sheep for the landlords at the emancipation meeting, and unanimously proposed: to defend today's emancipated time and not be slaves to Chiang Kai-shek and his like again. They then angrily joined the army hand in hand. Wu Yu Gong from Rencun Village led a group of young people to join the Independent Battalion. Wang ××, a peasant from ×× Village, which is only a few miles away from the puppet Yan stronghold, personally sent his son to the self-defense front, and said, "Go! Go to the front to defend our liberated area, so that Yan Xishan won't catch you and kill the people!" Fan Litai from × Village near the stubborn puppet stronghold also signed up to join the army. Because he was too young, he was not approved, but he became anxious and said, "You dislike me for being young, but the 19th Army (stubborn army) doesn't dislike me for being young. What if I am caught? I will die rather than go back!" When the masses in various villages sent off the new soldiers, the gongs and drums were loud, and they carried a large number of comfort goods draped in red and green to comfort the new soldiers. ×× Village also sent a large number of comfort goods through the stubborn puppet blockade line.

    【本报长治二十六日讯】祁县各村群众翻身后，纷纷要求武装保卫家乡。该县最近掀起参军热潮，首批青壮年百余人已涌入独立营。新塞村韩成儿和韩三儿弟兄两人在翻身会上沉痛回忆过去给地主放羊所受的痛苦，一致提出：要保卫今天翻身的时光，不能再给蒋介石们当奴隶，遂愤然携手参军。任村吴玉恭带领一班青壮年参加独立营。离阎伪据点几里地的××村农民王××亲送其儿子赴自卫前线，他说：“去吧！去前边保卫咱们解放区，免得叫阎锡山来把你抓了去杀害老百姓！”顽伪据点附近×村范礼太亦报名参军因年龄尚小，未被批准，它可急了，说：“你们嫌我小，十九军（顽军）可不嫌我小，抓走我怎办？我死也不回去！”各村群众欢送新战士时锣鼓喧天，披红戴绿抬着大批慰劳品慰劳新战士。××村并通过顽伪封锁线送来大批慰劳品。
