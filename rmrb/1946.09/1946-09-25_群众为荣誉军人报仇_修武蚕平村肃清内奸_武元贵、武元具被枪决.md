　　The Masses Avenge the Honored Serviceman
　　Suqing of Traitors in Canping Village, Xiuwu
　　Wu Yuangui and Wu Yuanju Executed

　　[Report from this newspaper in Xiuwu, 19th] Traitorous and special agent elements Wu Yuangui and Wu Yuanju of Canping Village, Fourth District, Xiuwu County, feigned activeness and infiltrated the militia organization, coercing the masses into beating to death honored serviceman Lao Han. After being exposed and accused by the masses, they have been executed by shooting. The Wu rebels had long ruled the village, committing all kinds of evil. After the village's liberation, they used a progressive facade to deceive district cadres, becoming militia captain and public security officer. In secret, they propagated, "The Eighth Route Army is leaving, the American army is coming, we will all be officials in the future, whoever helps will benefit." They used this to suppress the masses' struggle and deceived some backward masses into blindly following them. Honored serviceman Lao Han participated in the war against Japan for eight years and had political awareness. After retiring and settling in the village, he remained very active in his work. He continuously exposed their conspiracies. The Wus harbored resentment and fabricated so-called "crimes" of "Lao Han messing with women," detaining Lao Han. They convened a meeting, giving each member of the masses a stick and ordering them: "Whoever doesn't hit him won't do!" They also incited certain backward masses with the idea that "it doesn't matter if you beat an outsider to death." In the end, they beat Lao Han to death. Most of the masses knew that Lao Han died unjustly and reported the truth to the government, arresting the Wu rebels and secretly brewing a struggle against the special agents. On the sixth of this month, a mass meeting was held, and the masses rose up to accuse the Wus of their crimes and the process of murdering Lao Han, and recounted Lao Han's contributions to the people's struggle and the fact that he helped the masses everywhere in the village. Finally, they unanimously demanded "execute the special agents, avenge Lao Han." In accordance with the people's will, the government executed the two rebels on the spot, and the whole audience cheered with slogans such as "The government has eyes," "Eliminate the special agents," "Break Chiang Kai-shek's dog legs," and "Take good care of Lao Han's family."
