Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Looking at the overall situation of the civil war, the focus is still around Xuzhou and the central section of the Longhai Railway. This week, the Eighth Route Army has achieved brilliant counter-attack victories in this area. Chiang's forces, starting from Xuzhou and Zhengzhou in two large columns, invaded the Jiluyu Liberated Area with the aim of occupying the central areas such as Heze. The Eighth Route Army had long foreseen the enemy's plan and waited for Chiang's army to enter the predetermined encirclement zone on the border of He (Ze), Ding (Tao), and Cao (County). Then, they launched a vigorous counter-attack, annihilating the 20th Brigade (formerly the division) and the 3rd Brigade (formerly the division) of the Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army), and capturing Zhao Xitian, the division commander (formerly the army commander), alive. It is expected that there will be even more amazing victories in this theater. On the Subei front, General Su Yu's troops, after seven battles and seven victories, also recovered Huangqiao Town, annihilating 730 Chiang soldiers. Remembering that in the spring of 1941, the New Fourth Army defeated Han Deqin's 100,000 invading troops in this area. The remaining Chiang forces in Subei have now lost their ability to invade. The Chiang army defending Rugao and Hai'an is in imminent danger. On the Shanxi front, General Chen Geng's Taiyue troops and General He Long's Jin-Sui troops have joined forces in Fenxi. Chen's troops have also completely controlled the 270-mile railway between Linfen and Jiexiu, including Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Huoxian, and Lingshi. On the Shandong front, after two failed attacks by Chiang's army in the south (early July and early August), the third offensive took half a month, and apart from the heavy losses in occupying Taierzhuang, little progress was made. North of the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, the Eighth Route Army recovered Huantai. On the Ji-Re-Liao front, after Chiang's army occupied Chengde and other places, their forces were dispersed. When part of Chiang's army went south to occupy Lulong, the Eighth Route Army pursued them and recovered Doushan on the 2nd, cutting off their communication lines. On the 4th, the Eighth Route Army also recovered the location of the 13th Special Commissioner's Office, ＠① City, and Siji Town.

This newspaper, Longhai Front, 8th. On the 2nd, in our counter-attack in the battle to liberate Huaiyang, the heart of eastern Henan, we completely annihilated one regiment of the Kuomintang Henan Provincial Security Regiment and the security regiments of Huaiyang and Taikang counties, a total of three security regiments. In addition to casualties, we captured more than 2,000 people, seized more than 1,000 rifles, and many other military supplies.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 8th. The famous Lingshi Fujiatan mining area, after being liberated by our Eighth Route Army, is actively recovering and will soon be put into operation to serve the anti-civil war soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas. In the battle to liberate this mining area, two Japanese and more than 360 puppet mine police were captured alive. Eight large and small cannons, seven machine guns, more than 200 rifles, more than 1,000 boxes of explosives, three locomotives, 40 carriages, and many other military supplies were seized. On the 28th of last month, when our army liberated Lingshi, a total of more than 200 puppet soldiers who abandoned the city and fled laid down their weapons after being intercepted by our forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 8th. Chiang's army, entrenched in Zouping and Changshan on the north side of the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, continued to flee northeast to Huantai, but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army, and Huantai was recaptured. The Chiang army's Eighth Army Honorary First Division, part of the 73rd Army, and five regiments, including the Pacification Corps, invaded north from Zouping on the 27th of last month and were repelled by the Eighth Route Army and militia. After the entire army was routed, they regrouped the remnants on the 29th and launched another all-out attack under the cover of two American-made Chiang planes. On the 30th, they re-occupied Huantai and Jiaoqiao Town, 40 miles northeast of Zouping. The local militia, in coordination with the Eighth Route Army, rose up to resist heroically, fighting fiercely all day. Chiang's army was unable to hold out and fled back to Changshan and other places in separate directions. Huantai and Jiaoqiao Town were recovered on the same day. In the two self-defense wars, the Eighth Route Army killed and wounded a total of 480 Chiang soldiers, captured 83 of their company commanders and below alive, and seized six cannons (including four rocket launchers), eight American-style machine guns, more than 80 rifles, and many other military supplies.

　　豫东淮阳自卫战役中
    我歼蒋方三个保安团
    灵石傅家滩战斗中收获重大战果冀东恢复＠城渤海桓台失而复得
    【新华社延安八日电】综观整个内战形势，目前内战重心仍在徐州周围及陇海路中段沿线。在本周内，八路军在这方面获得了光辉的反击胜利。蒋方自徐州及郑州分两路大量北犯冀鲁豫解放区，其目的在占领该解放区荷泽等中心地区，八路军早已洞悉对方计划，俟蒋军进入荷（泽）定（陶）曹（县）边境预定包围圈内，即奋起反击，消灭第三师（原第十军）之第二十旅（原师）、第三旅（原师），生擒师长（原军长）赵锡田。预料该战区将有更惊人之捷报。在苏中前线，粟裕将军所部在七战七捷之后又收复黄桥镇，歼蒋军七百三十人。回忆在一九四一年春，新四军曾在该地击败韩德勤十万进犯军。苏中蒋方残军目前已失去进犯能力。因守如皋海安之蒋军，朝不保夕，岌岌可危。在山西前线：陈赓将军的太岳部队与贺龙将军的晋绥部队，已在汾西会合。陈部并完全控制了临汾介休间二百七十里铁路，包括路上洪洞、赵城、霍县、灵石等城在内。山东前线：南面蒋军两次进犯（七月上旬与八月上旬）失败后，第三次进攻费时半月，除以巨大损失侵占台儿庄外，殊少进展。胶济路西段以北，八路军收复桓台。冀热辽前线：蒋军侵占承德等地后兵力分散，当蒋军一部南下侵占卢龙时，八路军即追击其后，于二日收复都山，切断其连络线。四日，八路军又恢复十三专署所在地＠①城与司集镇。
    【本报陇海前线八日电】二日我反击解放豫东心脏淮阳战斗中，将盘踞该城之国民党河南省保安团一团及淮阳、太康两县保安团共三个保安团全部消灭，除毙伤外，俘虏二千余人，缴获步枪一千余支，其他军用品甚多。
    【本报阳城八日电】著名的灵石傅家滩矿区为我八路军解放后，正积极恢复中，不日即可开工，为解放区反内战军民服务。计在解放这一矿区的战斗中，生俘日人两名、阎伪军矿警三百六十余人，缴获大小炮八门，机枪七挺，步枪二百余支，炸药千余箱，火车头三个，车皮四十辆及其他军用品甚多。上月二十八日我军解放灵石时，弃城逃窜之阎伪军经我堵击后，放下武器者共二百余人。
    【新华社惠民八日电】盘踞于胶济路西段北侧邹平、长山两地之蒋军，继续向东北桓台窜犯，遭八路军击退，桓台城失而复得。蒋军第八军荣誉第一师、七十三军一部及绥靖团等五个团，于上月二十七日由邹平北犯，遭八路军及民兵有力反击全部溃退后，复于二十九日纠合残部在美制蒋机两架掩护下再度倾力出犯，于三十日复侵占桓台城及邹平东北四十里之焦桥镇。当地民兵配合八路军奋起抗击，激战竟日，蒋军不支，分头窜回长山等地，桓台及焦桥镇当日即告收复。八路军在两次自卫战争中，共毙伤蒋军四百八十名，生擒其连长以下八十三名，缴获大炮六门（内有火箭炮四门），美式机枪八挺，步枪八十余支，其他军用品甚多。
