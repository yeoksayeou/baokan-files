　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: The Shanghai Wenhui Bao reported on September 17th that Mr. Luo Longji, Mr. Zhang Bojun, and cultural figures such as Hong Shen and Mao Dun were paying close attention to Wallace's speech (referring to Wallace's foreign policy speech on the 12th) and expressed their approval. On the 16th of this month, they discussed Wallace's speech and American foreign policy after opening the preparatory meeting for the Li and Wen Commemoration. Luo Longji said, "I support Wallace's speech, especially his views on the Far East issue." He said that the Far East needs a peaceful, democratic, and united China composed of all parties and factions. He warned the great powers not to push China in a bad direction but should help China move towards democracy, peace, prosperity, and strength. Luo also said, "After Roosevelt's death, it can be said that the United States has no policy at all, and it just follows a few soldiers and a few right-wingers all day long. It is very obvious that the United States is following in Japan's footsteps. Japan specialized in dividing China and cultivating reactionary elements of the ruling class to oppress the progressive democratic forces." Professor Hong Shen humorously interjected, "Some people say that China is following the United States, but in fact, the United States is now learning from China—the military is in power, and all you hear is the sound of killing!" Zhang Bojun pointed out sharply, "The so-called policy of the United States is anti-Soviet and anti-communist. Therefore, the United States does not hesitate to cultivate the remaining fascist forces, even Spain and the collapsed Germany and Japan, the United States also counts in the 'revival'. The United States is indeed following the old path of Japan, allowing a few capitalists and a few soldiers to collude and dominate national politics. Isn't this the same as the Mitsui and Mitsubishi and the military cliques in power in Japan? This policy brings serious threats to the American people and democrats. Wallace can be said to be speaking on behalf of democratic America, so we cannot arbitrarily say that Wallace's faction cannot defeat the reactionaries. The power of the people is very great when it develops." Mao Dun expressed great contempt for Truman's inconsistent attitude towards Wallace.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: The Shanghai Wenhui Bao reported on September 18th that the Democratic National Construction Association, the China Economic Undertakings Advancement Association, and the September 3rd Society sent a joint letter to Wallace on the 17th, expressing their heartfelt support for Wallace's speech pointing out that the main key to establishing world peace lies in the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, allowing the parallel development of the two systems, and correctly pointing out that "China's unity and peace" is "based on the cooperation of domestic groups and not subject to foreign interference." They also hoped that Wallace would further lead the American people to urge the US government to change its wrong policy towards China to stop the Chinese civil war. The letter pointed out that the US government's "one-sided assistance" to China is the "most important factor" in promoting the Chinese civil war. Therefore, it is hoped that the US government should at least stop the one-sided assistance that encourages the civil war and allow the Chinese people to decide their own destiny."

　　沪名流及进步团体
　　对华氏演说极表赞同
    【新华社延安廿五日电】九月十七日沪文汇报载称：对于华莱士的演说（按指十二日华氏外交政策演说），民盟人士罗隆基、章伯钧、文化界先进洪深、茅盾诸氏，都甚为注意，并表示赞同。本月十六日，他们在开李、闻纪念筹备会后谈论起华莱士演说和美国的外交政策，罗隆基说：“我是支持华莱士的演讲的，尤其是对于远东问题的意见”。他说：远东需要一个和平的民主的各党各派联合的中国，他警告列强不要促使中国走向坏的方向，而应帮助中国走向民主和平富强的道路。罗氏又说：“罗斯福死后，美国可以说并无政策可言，一天到晚就跟着几个军人和几个右倾分子跑。很显明的，美国在蹈日本的复辙，日本曾专门分化中国，培植统治阶级的反动分子，以压迫进步的民主的力量。”洪深教授很幽默的插了一句：“有人说中国是跟着美国走，其实现在正是美国学中国——军人当权，只听见一片厮杀声！”章伯钧氏一针见血的指出：“美国目前的所谓政策，那就是反苏反共，所以美国不惜培养法西斯残余势力，连西班牙和坍了台的德国、日本，美国也算在“复兴”之列。美国现在确实在走日本的老路，让几个资本家和几个军人勾结在一起左右国政，这还不是像日本的三菱、三井与军阀的当权一样？这政策带给美国人民及民主人士以严重的威胁。华莱士可以说是代表民主美国发言，所以我们不能武断地说华莱士这一派战胜不了反动派，人民的力量发展起来是很大的。”茅盾则对杜鲁门对华氏出尔反尔的态度表示极大轻蔑。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】九月十八日沪文汇报称：民主建国会、中国经济事业协进会、九三学社等三政治团体于十七日联名致书华莱士，对于华莱士在演说中指出建立世界和平的主要关键在于苏美两国的友谊合作，听任二种制度平行发展，并正确指出“中国的统一和平”，“建筑于国内各团体的合作与不受外国干涉的基础上”表示衷心拥护，并盼华莱士更进一步领导美国人民督促美国政府改变错误的对华政策，以停止中国的内战。该函指出：美国政府对华的“片面援助”，乃是促使中国内战的“最重要的因素”，因此希望美国政府至少应停止足以鼓励内战的片面援助，听任中国人民自己来决定中国的命运。”
