The vivid and authentic story, and the simple and healthy poetry, made me forget my midday nap and read the script of "The White-Haired Girl" in one breath.

This is a legend from the liberated areas where the masses have turned themselves:

In the old society’s New Year, where "the landlord's family has wine and meat, and the tenant's family has no rice," tenant farmer Yang Bailao owed landlord Huang Shiren six dou seven sheng of rent and seven yuan and five jiao in silver dollars. The vicious Huang Shiren seized his daughter, Xi'er, who was his only support. With the regime controlled by local tyrants and bullies, what could Yang Bailao do?! Go to court? Huang Shiren's lackey, Mu Renzhi, said, "The county magistrate is a relative of the young master, this is the yamen, who are you going to talk to there?" As a result, Yang Bailao was forced to drink brine and commit suicide.

Xi'er, who lost her mother early, also lost her father and lived a dark life in Huang's house. She helplessly served Huang Shiren's mother smoking opium and toiled like a slave, until she was raped and abandoned by Huang Shiren. Finally, Huang Shiren wanted to kill Xi'er to "silence her" and to marry Miss Zhao from the city. Huang Shiren and his mother, who chanted scriptures and believed in Buddha, conspired to imprison Xi'er, who was seven months pregnant. Before they could act, Zhang Ershen, another person with the same fate as Xi'er, managed to rescue Xi'er and escape from the wolf's den.

The will to survive encouraged Xi'er, "Water that can't be scooped dry, fire that can't be extinguished! I won't die, I want to live! I want revenge, I want to live!" She got rid of Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi's pursuit and fled into a mountain cave. Wild fruits on the mountain and offerings from the Grandma Temple sustained the lives of the mother and child. After enduring more than three years of living in a cave, fearing wolves at night and people during the day, Xi'er's hair turned white.

When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, Chiang's army retreated, and the Eighth Route Army came. This people's army brought light and hope to the people, and supported them in launching a liberation movement. In the mass struggle, the legend of the "White-Haired Immortal" hindered the development of the movement. After active elements searched, they discovered that the "White-Haired Immortal" was not a monster. She was Xi'er, who was persecuted by Huang Shiren three years ago. Xi'er was rescued, and "the sun came out, driving away the cold and splitting the darkness!"

"A thousand years of hatred must be avenged, and ten thousand years of grievances must be redressed." The masses ignited the flames of anger. Huang Shiren, who was full of evil, was exposed and struggled against. The people's government accepted the reasonable and legal demands of the masses and sentenced Huang Shiren to death. Xi'er and the people who had been exploited in the past all breathed a sigh of relief. The great and majestic song: "Today we have turned ourselves over, today we see the blue sky!" was filled with the joy and victorious mood of the people!

If we simply think that this is just a folk tale, then we are wrong. Obviously, a very important theme runs through the six-act opera: "The old society turns people into ghosts, and the new society turns ghosts into people," allowing us to see the contrast between two different social systems (darkness and light). It raises the land issue, which urgently needs to be resolved in China today. The death of Yang Bailao and the suffering of Xi'er are both the result of farmers not having land and a democratic regime. Therefore, it is very timely for us to publish or perform "The White-Haired Girl" today. Undoubtedly, it has a promoting significance for today's mass movement.

"The White-Haired Girl" is a harmonious unity of poetry, music, and drama. After reading the script, I couldn't help but have this idea: if our border region's poetry authors also combined with drama, then it would be more widely spread to the masses, which would also add a lot of brilliance to poetry. I hope that after "The White-Haired Girl" is introduced to our region, we will have operas reflecting the mass struggle in our border region.

The success of "The White-Haired Girl" is due to the concentration of the wisdom of the masses. Although the writer is Comrade He Jingzhi, those who participated in the discussion and provided opinions included comrades who had done mass work in the place where this legend occurred, comrades who had lived as long-term tenant farmers, and writers of poetry, music, and drama. At the same time, after many performances, it educated the masses on the one hand, and on the other hand, the masses enriched the content of the play. From leading comrades of the Party to shepherd children among the common people, all provided opinions on it. This new creative method of "from the masses, to the masses" has made "The White-Haired Girl" a simple, healthy, and active work of art.

"The White-Haired Girl" has been performed in democratic cities such as Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Harbin, and Qiqihar, and has been warmly welcomed. The Reversal Troupe of Northern University recently gave a public performance of "The White-Haired Girl," which is a gratifying event in our border region's cultural activities.

The majority of the students in this newly established troupe are trying stage work for the first time. Because they have the understanding that "participating in the performance of 'The White-Haired Girl' is to serve the masses in turning themselves over," they have fully exerted their enthusiasm, creativity, and spirit of unity. Without a complete script, they asked people who had seen "The White-Haired Girl" to dictate the script from memory; in order to change scenes quickly, they used people to hold up branches as scenery; lacking rural life experience, they went to the countryside to observe the thoughts and actions of farmers. From this point of view, it should be commendable that their performance has achieved such success.

The entire performance of the play is relatively balanced and symmetrical. Whether in singing, accompaniment, or scenery, it is quite satisfactory. Once, when it was performed that Mu Renzhi was instigated by Huang Shiren to snatch Xi'er away, I looked back at the students of Handan Middle School in the back row, and many of them were in tears. Finally, when the sentencing of Huang Shiren to death was performed, the emotions of excitement and victory made the masses applaud and cheer. Some comrades from the military region's directly affiliated troops, after watching "The White-Haired Girl," expressed unlimited sympathy for the experiences of Xi'er and Yang Bailao, and extreme hatred for Huang Shiren.

Naturally, they were affected by objective conditions, and the performance inevitably had some imperfections.

Indeed, the sixth act is the most difficult to handle. In the first scene, the backward thinking of Huzi and Chen Laohan was too prominently expressed, causing the audience to not clearly see the leading role of active elements such as Da Suo, and also affecting the echo with the climax of the ending. The climax of the struggle meeting in the last scene seemed not enthusiastic, sharp, and serious enough, which may be due to the lack of deep understanding of the new ideological emotions of the masses.

An actor playing a role is an artistic creation; only when he forgets that he is an actor and is the character in the play, in other words, he is not acting, but living the same life as the character in the play, then his acting skills will be moving. If an actor is unconsciously constrained by some external form, it will be difficult for him to truly express the thoughts and actions of the character in the play. For example, when Yang Bailao was forced to put his handprint on the contract of indenture, his eyes stared straight at his fingers, trying to express his hatred. In fact, the unnatural action did not reveal his inner anger. If he had a deeper understanding of Yang Bailao's mood at that time, and thus produced actions that reflected this emotion, I think it might be more moving. The success or failure of acting skills mainly depends on the actor's depth of understanding of the character in the play. If, in the rehearsal of "The White-Haired Girl," the understanding of the essence of the script is taken as the main task (done with the greatest effort), then some shortcomings can be avoided.

The actor's actions should be subordinate to the effect of the drama. Zhang Ershen is a character who is sympathized with by the audience in the script. Because of this, I think it is best if she is not dressed up with bound feet, because her small footsteps will cause people to laugh, and this laughter is undoubtedly inconsistent with the effect of the play. At the same time, in the Hebei region, women with natural feet are also a common thing.

If "The White-Haired Girl" can appropriately adopt dance to perform, it may be even more outstanding. For example, in the scene where Xi'er escapes, if it is combined with various dances, it can be believed that its tension and imagery can be doubled.

### 《白毛女》剧作和演出

　　《白毛女》剧作和演出
    刘备耕
    生动真实的故事，朴素健康的诗歌，使我忘掉了午睡，一口气读完了《白毛女》剧本。
    这是群众翻了身的解放区的传说：
    在“主家门里有酒肉，佃户家里无米面”的旧社会的新年里，佃户杨白劳，欠地主黄世仁租子六斗七升及大洋七元五角，凶恶的黄世仁就抢走了与他相依为命的女儿——喜儿。政权在土豪劣绅把持下，杨白劳有什么办法呢？！上公堂吗？黄世仁的狗腿子穆仁智说：“县长就是少东家的亲戚，这儿就是衙门口，你到那儿说话去？”结果，杨白劳被迫喝卤水自尽了。
    早年丧母的喜儿又失掉了父亲，进到黄家过着黑暗的日子，她无可奈何地侍候黄世仁母亲抽鸦片，奴隶般地劳役着，以致于被黄世仁奸污了，抛弃了，最后黄世仁为了“灭口”和迎娶城里赵家的大小姐，要把喜儿害死。黄世仁和他念经信佛的母亲合谋把怀孕七个月的喜儿囚禁起来，快要下手之前，幸而另一个与喜儿同一命运的人——张二婶子，她设法救出了喜儿，逃出了狼窝。
    求生的意志，鼓励了喜儿，“舀不干的水，扑不灭的火！我不死，我要活！我要报仇，我要活”，摆脱了黄世仁和穆仁智的追赶，她逃进了山洞。山上的野果和奶奶庙的供食，维系了母子两人的生命，熬过三年多黑夜怕狼，白天怕人的穴居生活，天真活泼的喜儿身上发了白。
    抗战爆发，蒋军败退，八路军来了，这支人民的军队，给人民带来了光明和希望，支援人民起来掀起翻身运动。在群众斗争中，“白毛仙”的传说，起着阻碍运动发展的作用，经过积极分子的搜索，才发现“白毛仙”不是什么精怪，她就是三年前为黄世仁逼害的喜儿，喜儿得救了，“太阳出来了，驱走了寒冷，划开了黑暗！”
    “千年的仇要报，万年的冤要伸。”群众燃烧起愤怒的火焰，恶贯满盈的黄世仁被揭发了，被斗争了，人民的政府接受了群众的合理合法要求，判处了黄世仁的死刑。喜儿和过去被压榨的人们都出了一口气，伟大雄壮的歌声：“今天咱们翻了身，今天咱们见青天！”洋溢着人民的欢欣和胜利的心情！
    如果我们单纯地认为这仅仅是一件民间传说，那就错了。很明显的，六幕歌剧中贯串了一个非常重要的主题：“旧社会把人逼成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人”，使我们看到两种不同社会制度（黑暗与光明）的对比。它向我们提出了一个当前中国急需解决的土地问题；杨白劳的死和喜儿的遭难，都是由于农民没有土地和民主政权的结果。所以今天我们出版或演出《白毛女》，那是十分合乎时宜的，无疑问地，它对于今天的群众运动是有推动意义的。
    《白毛女》的剧作，是诗、音乐、戏剧三者和谐地统一。当我读罢剧本，不禁产生了这种想法：假若我们边区的诗歌作者，也同戏剧结合，那么它将更广泛地传布到群众中去，这也为诗歌增添了不少的光彩。我希望在《白毛女》介绍到本区后，我们将会有反映我们边区群众斗争的歌剧出现。
    《白毛女》的成功，是由于集中了群众的智慧，虽然执笔者是贺敬之同志，但是参加讨论和提供意见的，有曾经在发生这一传说的地方做过群众工作的同志，有自己过过长期佃农生活的同志，有诗歌、音乐、戏剧等作家，同时经过了多次的演出，一面它教育了群众，另一面群众又丰富了剧作内容，上至党的领导同志下至老百姓中的放羊娃娃都对它提供了意见。这种“从群众中来，到群众中去”的新创作方法，使《白毛女》才成为质朴、健康、积极的艺术作品。
    《白毛女》先后在延安、张家口、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等民主城市演出，受到了热烈的欢迎。我们北方大学翻身剧团，最近公演《白毛女》，是我们边区文化活动中的一件可喜的事情。
    一个新成立的剧团，大多数同学对舞台工作都是第一次尝试，由于他们具有“参加《白毛女》演出，就是为群众翻身服务”的认识，充分地发挥了他们的积极性、创造性和团结精神。没有完整的剧本，请曾经看过《白毛女》的人默写剧本；为了换景快，用人扶着树枝作布景；缺乏农村生活经验，下乡观察农民的思想和行动。从这个基础上看来，他们的演出有这样的成就，应该是难能可贵的。
    整个戏的演出，是比较平衡、匀称的。不论在演唱、伴奏、布景方面，都令人相当满意的。有一次，演到穆仁智受黄世仁唆使抢走喜儿时，我回头看后排的邯郸中学同学，他们有好多人都落泪了，最后演到判决黄世仁死刑，兴奋与胜利的情绪使群众鼓掌、欢呼。军区直属部队有的同志，看了《白毛女》后，对喜儿、杨白劳的遭遇，寄予无限的同情，对黄世仁则极端仇恨。
    自然，他们受了客观诸条件的影响，演出上难免没有一些不够完善的地方。
    的确，第六幕最不容易处理。第一场，虎子和陈老汉的落后思想，在表现上过于突出，致使观众看不清楚大锁等积极分子的带头作用，也影响到与结尾高潮的相呼应。末一场斗争会的高潮，显得不够热烈、尖锐和严肃，这可能是对群众新的思想情绪体会得不够深刻的缘故。
    演员扮演一个角色，是一个艺术的创造；只有当他忘记自己是演员而是剧中人的时候，换句话说，他不是做戏，而是同剧中人一样地生活，那么他的演技才会感动人。如果一个演员，不自觉地受到某种外形的约束，就很难真实地表达剧中人的思想和行动。譬如说，杨白劳被迫在卖身契上盖了手印，他的眼睛直看着他的手指企图表示愤恨，事实上，不自然的动作没有把他的内心愤怒显露出来。假若，他更深入地理解了杨白劳当时的心情，由此而产生了体现这种情感的动作，我想可能要较动人些。演技的成败，主要是决定于演员对剧中人的理解深浅，如果在《白毛女》的排演中，把理解剧本的精神实质，作为主要的工作来做，（用最大的力量来做）那末，有些缺点是可以避免的。
    演员的动作应服从于戏剧的效果。张二婶在剧本上，为观众所同情的人物，由于这样，我觉得，她最好不要小脚打扮，因为她的小脚步法，会引起人们的发笑，而这种笑，对于戏的效果无疑是不相符合的。同时，在河北地区来说，天足妇女也是一件平凡的事情。
    《白毛女》如果能适当地采用舞踊来演出，可能会更加出色。例如喜儿逃命这一场，倘使结合各舞踊，可以相信它的紧张性、形象性能够加倍地增强起来。
                                              一九四六年九月
                                                十七日于邯郸
