　　Qixian Laiyuan Town's Appearance Transformed
    People Coerced by the Yan Clique Fled Back One After Another
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The market town of Laiyuan in Qixian County has been restored thanks to the efforts of the county government. When our army liberated the town on the 30th of last month, only 95 elderly, weak, women, and children remained. The able-bodied young men were conscripted by the fleeing Yan clique, and the rest of the population was also largely coerced into being taken away. The land was barren, weeds grew rampant inside and outside the village, and grain and clothing were looted. As soon as our democratic government arrived, it immediately distributed grain for relief and organized the fifty people still able to work to weed the seedlings. They managed to clear some of the overgrown seedlings and put forward the slogan "Pull a few more weeds, eat an extra bowl of rice." Old men and children also went to the fields to pull weeds. After several days, the people who had been coerced into being taken away fled back one after another. The government then organized a market restoration committee and arranged for state-owned shops and some liberated area village cooperatives to come and do business, supplying necessities. Twenty-six businesses have already started operating. The surrounding rural villages have also come to the market. Currently, about a hundred families have successively returned to the town. People from Wu and Qin who were coerced and taken away by the Yan clique are also fleeing back one after another, passing through here on their way south. On August 21st alone, there were more than 40 people fleeing back collectively, arriving at Laiyuan. For this reason, the town has set up a reception center, specifically to receive returning compatriots.

　　祁县来远镇面目改观
    被阎伪胁去人民纷纷逃回
    【本报长治讯】祁县来远镇市场在该县政府努力下已恢复。该镇当上月三十号为我军解放时，仅余老弱妇孺九十五人，青壮年被逃窜之阎伪抓丁，其余人口亦大部被胁迫带走。土地荒芜，村里村外，杂草丛生，粮食、衣服被抢一空。我民主政府一到，立即发粮救济，并组织还能劳动的五十人锄苗，将老荒苗锄出一部，提出“多拔几根草，多吃一碗饭”的口号，老汉、孩子们也都上地拔草。经数日后，被胁迫带走人民纷纷逃回，政府又组织集市恢复委员会，组织公营商店与一些解放区的村合作社前来营业，供给必须品，现在开始营业的已有二十六家。周围农村亦均前来赶集。现人民陆续归来镇上者已约百家。被阎伪胁迫带走之武、沁人民亦纷纷逃回，经此南归。八月二十一日一天就有集体逃回的四十余人，到达来远，为此该镇特设招待所一处，专门招待还乡同胞。
