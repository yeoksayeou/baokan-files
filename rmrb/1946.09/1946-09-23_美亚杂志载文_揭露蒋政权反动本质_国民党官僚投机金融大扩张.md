　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Moscow, 17th, broadcast: *Meiya* magazine published an article last week stating: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang army tried its best to preserve its strength in preparation for using it in a civil war. The Kuomintang and its regime represent the interests of feudal landlords and are controlled by the most reactionary faction, the "CC Clique," who are trying to maintain their dictatorship and therefore oppose the implementation of democracy and land reform.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Kuomintang banks, bureaucratic capital, economic enterprises, and financial institutions that speculate and make fortunes are expanding unprecedentedly. According to Central Bank figures, in August, there were a total of 4,934 financial institutions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, including 1,414 head offices. Banks (including head offices and branches) accounted for 3,569 units (in 1937, there were only 164 banks nationwide, with over 1,300 branches). The remainder were silver firms, native banks, trust companies, insurance companies, and cooperative treasuries, which controlled a large amount of floating capital. In July, the amount of withdrawals from banks and native banks in 23 districts including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, and Chongqing reached over 10 million yuan, of which demand deposits, which can be deposited and withdrawn at any time and are convenient for high-level speculation, accounted for as much as 96%. Shanghai is the center of floating capital, with deposits accounting for one-half, or 15 million yuan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: The financial power of foreign monopoly capital in China is beginning to re-emerge. This power had once declined due to the Japanese invasion of China. At that time, only a few banks such as HSBC were operating in Chongqing and Kunming, but according to a Central News Agency dispatch: In August, there were already 13 foreign banks in Shanghai, with assets of 8 million yuan and deposits of over 1.53 million yuan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to customs statistics in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, from January to July of this year, the total value of imports in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was 61.4 million yuan, with American goods accounting for more than half, or 32.9 million yuan. The total value of exports was 9.6 million yuan, with imports exceeding exports by about seven times. Goods exported to the United States accounted for 48%, or 4.6 million yuan. Among the importing countries, the United Kingdom accounted for only 2.44%. Among the importing ports, Shanghai ranked first, accounting for 72% of the total imports and 61% of the total exports in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Among the imported goods, engines and their accessories imported from the United States were only 160,000 yuan, and the total amount was only 255,500 yuan, accounting for only 0.4% of the total import value. Most of the imported goods were consumer goods.
