　　Uniting and Transforming Middle Peasants in the Movement
　　New Progress in the Mass Movement in Jincheng
　　[Our Yangcheng Correspondent] In the initial stages of the anti-traitor and anti-local tyrant movement last winter and this spring, many cadres believed that middle peasants were "middlemen," slippery and wavering; poor peasants believed that middle peasants were law-abiding and colluded with landlords, thus forming a general phenomenon of disunity between middle and poor peasants, and the peasant associations closing their doors to middle peasants. At that time, in Liuquan Village, out of 29 peasant association members, only one was a middle peasant, and he was an old League member from before the December 12th Incident. In × District, out of 1,246 struggle targets, half were of middle peasant origin. The county party committee meeting in March reviewed this deviation, summarized and disseminated the successful experiences of Baofu Village in "pursuing backstage supporters" and "washing faces," and emphasized that "peasants are one family, and the target is landlords and local tyrants," so the transformation quickly began in various places. A large number of middle-peasant-component puppet soldiers, puppet organization personnel, petty accomplices, and petty local bullies confessed and repented under the "washing face" policy of treating illnesses to save people, and deeply exposed the crimes of major traitors, major local bullies, and landlord gentry, returning to the peasant camp. As the movement deepened to rent reduction, debt clearing, grievance telling, and digging up the roots of poverty, class boundaries became clearer. Poor peasants in Dongguan said: "Middle peasants have small black spots on their faces and great bitterness in their hearts." Poor peasants all recognized that middle peasants were their class brothers. In the three-month rent reduction and debt clearing movement, middle peasants not only participated in the movement in large numbers, but also a large number of activists emerged, and many middle peasants joined the militia. At the mass work meeting in June, a fierce debate on "who struggles against whom" and "who struggles" was launched to overcome the remaining emotions of excluding middle peasants among some comrades. Farmer cadre Dong Zhangying said: "Many poor peasants used to be middle peasants, only because the landlords exploited them until they were dry, that they became poor peasants. If the Communist Party had come three years later, the current middle peasants would have become poor peasants too." In the two months since the meeting, middle peasants have more widely participated in the in-depth rent reduction and debt clearing struggle. As a result, the scale of the movement has become more grand and achieved significant progress.

　　运动中团结改造中农
    晋城群运获新进展
    【本报阳城讯】在去冬今春反汉奸反恶霸初期，许多干部都认为中农是“中间人”，滑头动摇；贫农认为中农是有法的，与地主有勾结，于是形成普遍的中、贫农不团结，农会对中农关门等现象。柳泉村当时廿九个农会会员中，只有一个中农，还是十二政变前的老议盟会员。×区斗争对象一千二百四十六人，有一半是中农成份。三月的县委会议检讨了这一偏向，总结并传播了保伏村“追后台”与“洗脸”的成功经验，着重提出“农民是一家，目标是地主恶霸”，各地乃很快开始了转变。大批中农成份的伪军伪组织人员与小走狗、小恶霸纷纷在治病救人的“洗脸”政策下坦白悔过，并深入揭发大汉奸、大恶霸、豪绅地主的罪恶，回到农民阵营来。在运动深入到减租清债诉苦挖穷根的时候，阶级界限更加明显。东关贫农群众说：“中农脸上有小黑，肚里有大苦”。贫农都认识了中农是自己的阶级兄弟。在三个月的减租清债运动中，中农不仅大批参加了运动而且也涌现了不少积极分子，许多中农参加了民兵。在六月份的群众工作会议上，更展开“斗争谁”与“谁斗争”的剧烈争辩，克服了某些同志残余的排斥中农情绪。农民干部董张英说：“有许多贫农以前也是中农，只因地主把他们剥削干了，才成了贫农。共产党迟来三年，现在的中农也都成了贫农啦。”会后两月来，中农更普遍的参加了深入减租清债的斗争。运动规模因而更加宏大，获得重大进展。
