Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: A London dispatch from the US News Service on September 24th states: "The most important point is Stalin's attitude towards US troops in the Far East." This is how the British Foreign Office views Stalin's conversation with Mr. Yurte, the Moscow correspondent of the British Sunday Times. The British Foreign Office stated: "The British government respects the agreements reached at the Moscow Conference regarding the Far East, but has publicly expressed doubts about MacArthur's policies." British government officials described Stalin's remarks as "astonishing," but believe that this implies that the Soviet government wishes to make Soviet-British relations more normal.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: London News: Former British Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech calling on all Allied nations to restore the spirit that once inspired them. Eden said: Relations with the Soviet Union should perhaps be handled from a new perspective.

    【新华社延安二十五日电】据美新闻处伦敦二十四日电：“最重要的一点，是斯大林对于远东美军的态度”，这是英外交部方面对斯大林向英星期泰晤士报驻莫斯科记者约尔特谈话的看法。英外交部方面称：“英政府尊重莫斯科会议关于远东方面所成立的协定，但对于麦克阿瑟政策曾公开表示疑虑”。英国政府方面人士用“惊人”一词形容斯大林的谈话，但对此谈认为他以前即已暗示，苏联政府愿使苏英关系更为正常。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】伦敦讯：英前外相艾登最近发表演说，呼吁各盟国恢复曾经鼓舞它们的精神。艾登说：和苏联的关系也许应该由新的角度来处理。
