Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 7th. General Hao Pengju and Deputy Commander Bi Shuwen of the Central China Democratic Allied Army, leading all officers and soldiers, issued a nationwide telegram on September 3rd to sternly denounce the Central News Agency's slander and defamation of the military. The original telegram is as follows:

　　"Pengju, etc., have recently heard the Central News Agency broadcast the 'news' that Pengju 'received advice from Xue Yue, led his troops to defect, and engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army,' and were all filled with extreme grief and anger. Now, we sincerely make public to the whole country the purpose of our army's uprising and the whole story of how our army was subjected to the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracies and traps, in order to uphold justice and correct rumors. Since Pengju, etc., launched the uprising on January 9th of this year, abandoning the Sixth Route Army designation of Chiang Kai-shek, breaking away from the dictatorial government, opposing the civil war, and supporting democracy, we have vowed to be the people's armed force and to fight for the democratic cause forever. Unexpectedly, the reactionaries' ambitions did not die, and conspiracies emerged one after another. First, they sent Li Kechang, a traitor of our army, with Xue Yue's order, to lure us with the designation and territory of an army group, vainly attempting to use high official positions and generous salaries to make Pengju, etc., commit the crime of betraying the people of the whole country. Seeing that we were righteous and resolute, the reactionaries still did not know how to repent and reflect. They then sent secret envoys to play with sweet words and heavy gifts, determined to trap me and my army in unrighteousness. Because their treacherous schemes repeatedly failed, they finally revealed their true colors and openly made shameless broadcasts, and printed leaflets in Pengju's name, falsely claiming that Pengju had taken office as the commander of the 42nd Army Group, using airplanes to distribute them everywhere, attempting to confuse people's minds and provoke the close relationship between our army and friendly forces. Their intentions are vicious, and their tricks are clumsy, truly the most ignorant and shameless! It should be known that when Pengju, etc., automatically and consciously launched the uprising, we were determined to unite closely with the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and other democratic armies, democratic parties, patriotic people, and social elites, wholeheartedly and with one mind, to fight together for independence, peace, and democracy. Heads can be severed, blood can flow, but this heart is as pure as ice, and this will is as firm as jade. Now the reactionaries, in order to save their dictatorial fate, use American force to launch a nationwide civil war, leading wolves into the house and acting as tigers. The motherland is in crisis, and the people are suffering. All those with righteousness and humanity are filled with righteous indignation, rising up to stop the civil war, defend peace, and defend the people to save the motherland. Our army is now the people's armed force and should sacrifice for the people. How can we bear to act as the pawns of the reactionaries to harm the people!? We vow to do our utmost to save the critical situation, dedicate ourselves to the task until our death! The telegram is filled with excitement, and tears flow with blood! This sincere heart is expressed in detail.

　　Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bi Shuwen, Chief of Staff Liu Zhongyang, Deputy Chief of Staff Zhao Tingxun, Division Commanders Nie Tingbin, Zhang Qi, Li Tiemin, Liu Jirui, Special Forces Commander Li Zezhou, and all officers and soldiers together kowtow. September 3rd."

    【新华社临沂七日电】华中民主联军郝鹏举、毕庶文正副总司令率全军将士，为中央社造谣诬蔑该军事，于九月三日通电全国，严加斥责，原电如下：
    鹏举等顷闻中央社广播，诬称鹏举“受薛岳之忠告，率部反正，与共军激战”之“新闻”，莫不痛愤万状，发指眦裂。兹谨竭诚将本军起义宗旨，及本军备受国民党当局阴谋陷害之始末，公诸全国，以张正义，以正听闻。溯鹏举等自今年一月九日举义。抛弃蒋介石第六路军番号，脱离独裁政府，反对内战，拥护民主以来，即誓为人民武力、永远为民主事业而奋斗。不料反动派野心不死，阴谋百出，先则派本军叛徒李克昌，衔薛岳之命，诱以集团军番号及地盘，妄图以高官厚禄，使鹏举等作背叛全国人民之罪行。继见吾等义正辞严，心如铁石，反动派犹不自知悔改反省，复遣密使搬弄甘言重帛，必欲陷本人本军于不仁不义而后快。因其奸计一再难逞，乃图穷匕见，竟公然作无耻广播，并假借鹏举名义印制传单，诬称鹏举已就职四十二集团军总司令，利用飞机到处散发，企图混淆人心，挑拨本军与友军之亲密关系，其用心之毒，伎俩之拙，诚为无知无耻之尤！须知鹏举等自动自觉起义之时，即决心与八路军、新四军暨其他民主军队、民主党派、爱国人士、社会贤达亲密团结，一心一德，共同为争取独立和平民主而奋斗。头可断，血可流，此心如冰洁，此志如玉坚。今反动派为挽回其独裁末运，借用美国武力，发动全国内战，引狼入室，为虎作伥。祖国危急，生灵涂炭。凡有正气人性者，莫不义愤填胸，慨然奋起，制止内战，保卫和平，保卫人民，以救祖国。本军现为人民之武力，当为人民而牺牲。何忍反作反动派之爪牙，以残害人民！？誓愿竭尽驽钝，共挽危局，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已！临电愤激，血泪交流！耿耿此心，披沥陈叙。
    总司令郝鹏举、副总司令毕庶文、参谋长刘仲阳、副参谋长赵廷勋、师长乜庭宾、张奇、李铁民、柳纪瑞，特种兵团指挥官李泽洲暨全体将士同叩。九月三日。
