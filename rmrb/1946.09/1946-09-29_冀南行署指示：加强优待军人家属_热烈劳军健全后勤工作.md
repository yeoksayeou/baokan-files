Ji'nan Administrative Office Instruction: Strengthen Preferential Treatment for Military Families
　　Enthusiastically Support the Army, and Improve Logistics Work
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 26th dispatch] The Ji'nan Administrative Office recently instructed its subordinates to strengthen preferential treatment for military families, army support, and logistics work, first stating that the past undesirable phenomena in preferential treatment for the resistance must be overcome, and the most pressing problems of the current resistance families should be resolved. A. Resistance families with no land or little land should be given priority in this mass movement. In the distribution of the fruits of struggle, the families of martyrs and military personnel should be upgraded by one level. For example, if the general public has three mu, military families should have four mu. Active-duty soldiers should be allocated land, and if there is no one at home, the village should cultivate and manage it on their behalf. B. The autumn crops of martyrs' and resistance families without labor should be guaranteed to be brought home. Wheat should be guaranteed to be planted. Autumn land should be guaranteed to be plowed. C. Based on the material conditions of each county, the families of martyrs and resistance personnel without housing should be helped to solve the problem this winter. Such as temporarily borrowing other people's houses, allocating public houses and traitor's houses, etc. If it still cannot be solved, some trees, bricks, and tiles can be allocated from the fruits of struggle, or a part of the grain collected for preferential treatment of military families can be used to purchase trees, bricks, and tiles, and mobilize the masses to repair them. Those who need to renovate should do their best to help renovate. If the financial resources are insufficient for the time being, it will be resolved by next spring or next autumn. It also stated that in order to encourage the morale of the frontline troops and create a mass upsurge in joining the army, a warm army support movement should be launched, writing widespread letters of慰问 (wèiwèn - condolence/sympathy/comfort), raising donations, and making comfort bags, shoes, socks, and towels. All personnel of the Party, government, military, and people should save one or two liang of rice per day for慰问 (wèiwèn - condolence/sympathy/comfort). Launch donations and create a mass army support movement. The instruction finally emphasized the need to strengthen logistics work. In areas where military stations need to be established, strong cadres should be transferred to take charge to ensure timely and accurate transfers. Each county (especially the border counties) should, according to the instructions of the Military Commission, step up militia activities to prevent saboteurs and spies from causing trouble.
