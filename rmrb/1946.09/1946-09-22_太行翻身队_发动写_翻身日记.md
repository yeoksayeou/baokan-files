　　Taihang Emancipation Team Launches "Emancipation Diary" Writing Campaign
    [Our dispatch] After the Taihang Military Region Administrative Office's Emancipation Team arrived in Wuzhi County, everyone deeply felt that participating in this great mass emancipation movement was of great significance, both to themselves and to their work. In personal history, it is also a memorable event. Therefore, the leadership initiated a "Emancipation Diary" writing campaign. It is planned to compile these into a booklet in the future, which will be a good contribution to the Taihang mass movement and a good souvenir for individuals. On the evening of August 30th, a forum was held to discuss how to write the diaries. Everyone suggested that to write a good "Emancipation Diary," the first requirement is to be honest, say what you have, write what you do, avoid affectation, and dare to expose your true ideological changes without any concealment, in order to transform yourself. Second, reduce argumentation and write more about meaningful practical matters, such as: stories of people after emancipation, work experience, and systematic materials. The most important thing is to implement and persevere. It can also be combined with news reporting work. After the meeting, many people ordered emancipation diaries and started writing.

　　太行翻身队  发动写“翻身日记”
    【本报讯】太行军区行署翻身队，到了武陟县后，大家深深感到参加此次伟大的群众翻身运动，不论对自己，对工作，都有着很大的意义。在个人历史上，也是一件可纪念的大事。因此领导上特发起一个记“翻身日记”运动。准备将来集成小册子，这对太行群运是个很好的贡献，对个人也是个很好的纪念品。八月三十日晚，召开座谈会，讨论如何记法，大家提出要写好“翻身日记”第一要态度老实，有啥说啥，做啥写啥，避免矫柔做作，并要敢于暴露自己的真正思想变化，毫不隐瞒，以便改造自己。第二少发议论，多写有意义的实际事情。如：翻身后的人物故事，工作经验等及有系统的材料，最重要的是要贯彻坚持。并可与新闻报导工作结合起来。会后好多人都已订起翻身日记本，开始写起来。（张碧生）
