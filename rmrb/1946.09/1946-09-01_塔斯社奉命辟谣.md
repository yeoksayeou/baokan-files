　　TASS Commissioned to Refute Rumors
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] TASS refutes rumors: A recent report from Shenbao's correspondent in Washington stated that during the Potsdam Conference negotiations, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union supposedly signed a secret treaty to divide China. The report pointed out that in the past week, news about such a treaty has also been circulating in the United States. TASS is commissioned to declare: The aforementioned news has no basis whatsoever and is clearly a provocative and fabricated rumor.

　　塔斯社奉命辟谣
    【新华社延安二十八日电】塔斯社辟谣：最近申报驻华府记者消息说，在波茨顿会议进行谈判时，似乎英美苏三国签订了瓜分中国的秘密条约。该报指出：最近一周，在美国也散布了关于这种条约的消息。塔斯社奉命声明：上述消息没有任何根据，显系有挑拨性的捏造的谣言。
