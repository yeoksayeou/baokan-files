　　The Soviet Economic Atomic Bomb
    Huang Caoliang

    In the complex international situation, it is meaningful to compare the post-war economic situations of the Soviet Union and the United States.

    In terms of employment: the Soviet Union has no unemployed people, and the people can obtain suitable jobs and work hard for the further prosperity of the country; but in the United States, the post-war unemployment problem has formed serious social unrest. According to the May 15th issue of the American Newsweek, the number of unemployed will reach 7.5 million by September. However, according to the official US estimate, there were 6 million unemployed in March, and there will be 3 million veterans by September, totaling 9 million. Even if some children, women, and the elderly may withdraw from the labor market, and 500,000 veterans may go to school, the number of unemployed should be at least around 8 million. This number has reached more than half of the highest number of unemployed during the economic panic of 1929-1932.

    In terms of strikes: Not only are there no strikes in the Soviet Union, but all workers are involved in the socialist competition wave to complete and exceed the new five-year plan; but in the United States, since the end of the war, nationwide strike waves have broken out everywhere. Following the three major strikes by steel, electrical, and meat workers, there were three more major strikes affecting national production by coal, railway, and maritime workers, so that the number of strikers in May exceeded the peak of 1.6 million. As of June 1, 98.6 million worker-days were lost due to strikes, which is equivalent to 10,000 workers needing to work for 27 years to recover this loss. At present, due to rising prices, the meager wage increases obtained by workers through persistent struggle have been canceled out. The Congress of Industrial Organizations and the United Automobile Workers have warned the capitalists that if the workers' demands are not met, new strikes will be launched. Therefore, labor unrest in the United States will continue to occur.

    In terms of production: one side is sharply increasing, the other side is decreasing. In the Soviet Union, in the first half of this year, several of the most important industrial productions have increased sharply and exceeded the plan. Iron production exceeded the half-year plan by 2.6 percent, steel by 7.3 percent, and rolled gold metal by 5.4 percent. Compared with the first half of last year, pig iron production increased by 10.3 percent, steel by 13.1 percent, and coal and oil production also completed the plan ahead of schedule. Particularly important is that when the world is suffering from famine threats, the entire Soviet Union has a universal harvest this year. The summer harvest in the central and eastern regions is unprecedented in 25 years. In May (the US Information Service also admitted) Soviet grain production is "one of the sectors with an advantage" compared to the UK and the US. But in the United States, in terms of industrial production alone, output has fallen sharply due to strikes and other reasons. According to the June 10th US Information Service weekly, the strikes in the first four months of this year reduced steel production by 13 million tons (equivalent to the annual output of the pre-war Japanese Empire), automobile production by 1.06 million vehicles (a maximum of 1.5 million vehicles can be produced annually in the future), and coal production by 90 million tons. If the continuous strikes since June are added, the reduction in industrial production will be even more alarming.

    In terms of prices: one side is soaring, the other side is plummeting. In the Soviet Union, due to the increase in the production of grain and consumer goods, the Soviet government has abolished the voucher purchase system for bread and grains this year, and the prices of various goods in business stores have been reduced by 45 percent since July 1, which is the only phenomenon in the post-war world. As a result, the lives of the Soviet people have greatly improved, and the number of customers in various stores has increased sharply. The Moscow Central Department Store had 95,000 transactions in just three days. But the United States is going in the opposite direction: since price controls were stopped on June 30, prices in the United States have soared, with meat prices being the highest in 26 years, grain rising by 31.3 percent, rents rising by 120 times, and other daily necessities also soaring. However, the highest wage increase for general workers after the strike is only 25 percent, so the lives of general salaried people are greatly affected, and the result is another large-scale wage increase struggle.

    The above comparison reflects the opposite situations of the socialist system and the monopoly capitalist system. It is no wonder that the Associated Press reporter in Moscow was amazed by the plummeting prices in the Soviet Union and said, "This is the Soviet economic atomic bomb."

　　苏联的经济原子弹
    黄操良
    在错综复杂的国际局面中，比较一下苏美两国国内的战后经济情况是很有意味的。
    在就业方面：苏联没有一个失业者，人民都能获得适当的工作岗位，为国家的进一步繁荣而努力；但在美国，战后的失业问题形成了严重的社会不安。据五月十五日美国新闻周刊估计，失业人数至九月将达七百五十万人，但据美官方估计，三月份失业者即有六百万人，而到九月尚有退伍军人三百万，总计即达九百万。纵使有一部份儿童、妇女、老人可能退出劳动市场及五十万退伍军人可能就学，而失业人数至少当在八百万左右。这一数目已达一九二九——三二年经济恐慌时期失业最高额的一半以上了。
    在罢工方面：苏联不仅没有罢工，而且所有职工都卷入了为完成并超过新五年计划的社会主义竞赛浪潮中；但在美国自战争一结束，全国即到处爆发了大罢工风潮，继钢铁、电汽与肉类工人三次大罢工后，接连又发生了烟煤、铁路和海员工人的三次影响全国生产的大罢工，以至五月罢工人数突破了一百六十万的最高峰。至六月一日为止，因罢工而损失的工人达九千八百六十万个，等于一万工人要入工二十七年才能恢复这一损失。目前由于物价腾涨的结果，取消了工人以坚持斗争所得的微薄的工资增加。产业工会联合会、联合汽车工会已向资方发出警告，如不满足工人要求，即将发动新的罢工，因此美国的工潮势将不断发生。
    在生产方面：一面是剧增，一面是减低，苏联在几种最重要的工业生产上，今年上半年均激增而超过了计划，铁产量超过半年计划百分之二点六，钢超过百分之七点三，卷金金属超过百分之五点四。如与去年上半年比较，生铁产量增加百分之十点三，钢百分之十三点一，煤炭、石油产量也先期完成计划。特别重要的，当世界遍地正受饥荒威胁之时，今年全苏却普遍的丰收，中部和东部地区的夏收是二十五年所未有。五月份（美新闻处也承认）苏联的粮食生产与英美比较起来“是据有优势的部门之一”。但在美国仅就工业生产而言，由于罢工及其他原因，产量已大为跌落。据六月十日美新闻处周刊称：今年头四个月的罢工，使钢铁减产一千三百万吨（等于战前日本帝国的全年产量），汽车减产一百零六万辆（今后每年最多可产一百五十万辆），煤减产九千万吨，如再加上六月以来的连绵不断的罢工，工业的减产当更为惊人。
    在物价方面：一面是飞涨，一面是大跌。苏联由于粮食及消费品生产的增长，苏联政府已于今年取消了面包五谷等的凭证购物制，营业商店的各物价格已自七月一日起减低百分之四十五，是战后世界各国中仅有的现象。因此苏联人民生活大大改善了，各商店顾客剧增，莫斯科中央百货商店仅三日内即有九万五千起交易。但在美国却走着相反的道路：自六月三十日物价管制停止后，美国百物昂贵，肉类价格之高为二十六年所仅见，粮食上涨了百分之三十一点三，房租竟涨了一百二十倍，其他日用品也飞涨不已。但一般工人工资经罢工后最高仅增加百分之二十五，因此一般薪金阶层生活大受影响，其结果是再次掀起大规模的增资斗争。
    以上对比，反映了社会主义制度和垄断资本主义制度的相反情况。无怪乎美联社记者在莫斯科眼见苏联物价的暴跌而惊异不已的说：“这是苏联的经济原子弹。”
