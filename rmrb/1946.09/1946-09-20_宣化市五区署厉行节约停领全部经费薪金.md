Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 16th: The Fifth District Office of Xuanhua City recently applied to the Municipal Government to cease receiving all funding and salaries during the self-defense war (starting this month), relying entirely on production and economy for self-sufficiency. The district has carefully formulated a budget for the second half of the year. Calculated according to current prices, this budget is more than 3.16 million yuan less than the standard stipulated by the Municipal Government. The district plans to solve the entire funding need of over 10 million yuan this year through income from the coal mine jointly operated by the district and families of Eighth Route Army soldiers. At the same time, this will reduce the government's subsidy of over 14 million yuan to the 62 military families in the district who are engaged in coal mine production. All cadres in the district have abolished the salary system and returned to the living allowance system, which is estimated to save more than 3.8 million yuan. The Municipal Government has approved the district's application and issued a circular to commend it.
