　　To Effectively Eliminate the Enemy's Living Forces
    Our Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Chengde
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st] The flames of civil war have spread from within the Great Wall to beyond. Since August 20th, Chiang's 13th and 53rd Armies have launched a large-scale invasion of Chengde. In order to effectively eliminate the enemy's living forces, the Eighth Route Army strategically withdrew from Chengde on the 28th. Chiang's army's invasion is under the pretext of "rescuing" Yan's puppet troops in Datong. However, the Eighth Route Army's attacks and encirclement of Yan's puppet troops in northern Shanxi were to alleviate the serious situation in the southern Shanxi liberated area caused by Hu Zongnan's crossing of the river to coordinate with Yan's army in attacking. Now, Chiang's army not only does not cease its offensive in southern Shanxi, but also expands its offensive in Rehe, invading and occupying Chengde. Chiang Kai-shek's responsibility for launching a full-scale civil war is now undeniable.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st] Military observers here say that the Eighth Route Army's planned withdrawal from Chengde will further increase Chiang's army's difficulties. Chiang's army has invaded the vast area of Rehe, defending Chengde and other towns and extended lines of communication, dispersing its forces, which will give the Eighth Route Army a better opportunity to eliminate its living forces. Rehe was abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek to the Japanese, and it was recovered by the Eighth Route Army from the Japanese invaders. The Eighth Route Army and the people of Rehe will never recognize Chiang's army's invasion of Chengde and other places. They will continue to defend themselves and fight until they recover the lost territories. Rehe and Chengde will forever belong to the people.

　　为有效消灭进犯者有生力量
    我军自动撤离承德
    【新华社延安三十一日电】内战烽火已自关内延烧到长城以外。自八月二十日起，蒋军十三军与五十三军即大举进犯承德，八路军为有效地消灭进犯者有生力量，已于廿八日有计划撤离承德。蒋军侵占是以“解救”大同阎伪军为借口，但晋北八路军对大同阎伪军的打击和包围，是为了解救胡宗南渡河与阎军协同进攻所造成的晋南解放区严重形势。现蒋军不但不停止在晋南的进攻，反而在热河扩大进攻，侵占承德。蒋方发动全国内战的责任已无可置辩。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】此间军事观察家称：八路军有计划地撤离承德，将更增加蒋军的困难。蒋军侵入热河广大地区，守备承德等城镇及延长的交通线，兵力分散将予八路军以消灭他有生力量的更好机会。热河是蒋介石丢弃给日本人的，是八路军从日寇手中收复的，八路军和热河人民永不承认蒋军对承德等地的侵占，他们将继续自卫和战斗下去，一直到收复失地，热河和承德是永远属于人民的。
