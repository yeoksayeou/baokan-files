　　Anyang County Government Notice to Fleeing Landlords:
　　Repentance and Return Will Be Treated Favorably; Those Who Rely on the Enemy and Commit Violence Will Be Severely Punished
    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Anyang forced a small number of misguided fleeing landlords to sabotage production, loot autumn harvests, rape women, and slaughter the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas and our border areas. Our Anyang Democratic Government, in order to truly protect the interests of the people and give those who have gone astray a path to self-renewal, hereby issues a proclamation calling on those who fled because they did not understand the true meaning of the land reform movement and were instigated and lured by special agents, as long as they do not violate the interests of the masses, thoroughly repent, and return to the liberated areas, the government will appropriately guarantee their land and property to maintain their livelihood, and will do its best to help them develop in the industrial and commercial fields. Do not be blinded by the temporary ferocity of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets. Those who voluntarily return will be treated favorably by the government. Those key figures who rely on the enemy and commit violence, stubbornly sabotage the interests of the masses, and refuse to repent will be resolutely suppressed. The military and civilians of the entire county are allowed to capture and send them to the county for severe punishment at any time. The proclamation pointed out: The fruits of the masses' struggle (such as land and property) in villages occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppets are not allowed to be changed or violated. Those who take advantage of the fire to loot, forcibly change things, spread rumors and sabotage, steal the fruits of struggle, and steal mature autumn seedlings and other rebellious acts will be severely punished according to the law once captured in the future.
