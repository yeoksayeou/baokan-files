　　Intensify Transportation to Guarantee Frontline Supplies
　　The Chiang Kai-shek's warlord clique, like a wounded beast, relying on the claws and teeth armed by its master, American imperialism, is launching a more frantic attack on the people of the liberated areas. In our border region, Hu Zongnan's troops on the Datong-Pukou Railway (South) are continuing to reinforce their troops, preparing to expand their invasion. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, Gu Zhutong, and others are personally directing and deploying 50 divisions, attempting to "annihilate" the military and civilians of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area in one fell swoop, realizing the conspiracy to firmly control the Longhai Railway and connect the Beijing-Hankou and Tianjin-Pukou lines. A major battle is about to break out on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front.
　　Our heroic frontline soldiers, under the wise command of Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng, are sparing no blood and sacrifice, and have achieved many brilliant victories. In the future, they will continue the spirit of the martyrs in the battles of Dayang Lake, Ta'ershan, and other battles, and strive for more victories to protect the lives and property of the people in the liberated areas and the national peace and democratic cause. However, their high morale and determination to win must be guaranteed by sufficient materials. Therefore, the strengthening of rear work has become an important part of winning victories in the future.
　　Since the war of self-defense, the people of our region have fully demonstrated their spirit of sharing a common hatred of the enemy. Movements to support the front lines, such as joining the army and participating in the war, organizing stretcher transportation, and stepping up production, have been widely launched. For example, in southern Hebei-Shandong-Henan, a large number of war heroes have emerged, and model deeds such as Dingtao strengthening logistics work and the people along the Datong-Pukou Railway actively participating in the war have been frequently seen. This is the result of the liberated areas realizing land to the tiller, and it is a manifestation of the increased awareness of the people in the liberated areas. However, we cannot be complacent because of this, nor can we be proud and relaxed because of the two great victories of the Longhai Railway and the great victory of the Datong-Pukou line in the past two months. On the contrary, we must deeply recognize the seriousness of the current war situation, and we must recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the war. Rear work must closely cooperate with the front line, and must have strict organizational work and strong leadership. All work should be redoubled for the victory of the front line, so as to carry out a long-term and arduous struggle with the Chiang Kai-shek's warlord clique.
　　Rear personnel must, like frontline soldiers, use the spirit of combat, improve work efficiency, overcome the mentality of paralysis and fluke, and overcome the remaining bad habits of waste and perfunctoriness. Therefore, first, rear work must be guaranteed to be done well, everything must adapt to the needs of the war, factories and workshops must increase production and improve quality, and farmers must rush to harvest, concentrating all their strength on winning the victory on the front line! Second, step up the organization of all available forces for transportation to ensure frontline supplies, because the material supply is indispensable for the hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front line who are fighting the enemy to win victories, and the consumption is very huge. Although our heroic soldiers have often defeated the enemy in extremely difficult material conditions, in large-scale wars, if the supply of military supplies is slightly delayed, it will often delay or even affect the victory. The transportation of these huge quantities of military supplies and wounded stretchers requires a huge transportation force, and the organization and mobilization of this transportation force must be carried out through meticulous work.
　　We should immediately respond to Chairman Yang's call. In addition to mobilizing the people of the liberated areas to participate more actively in stretcher transportation, governments at all levels must immediately inspect the logistics work in the rear. All logistics agencies must also step up the improvement of their work to make this work more effective, more scientific, and more accurate, and organize the vast masses participating in the war in an orderly manner, giving full play to their strength to the highest degree. We must not only race against time, but also race against time, and transport military supplies to the front line without delaying a minute!

### 加紧运输保证前方供应

　　加紧运输保证前方供应
    蒋介石好战集团，像被击伤的野兽一样，凭着它主子美帝国主义所武装的爪牙，向解放区人民作更疯狂的进攻，在本边区，同蒲南线胡宗南部，继续增兵准备扩大进犯。在冀鲁豫方面，蒋介石、陈诚、顾祝同等，亲自指挥布置五十师兵力，企图一举“消灭”我冀鲁豫解放区军民，实现确掌陇海、贯通平汉、津蒲两线的阴谋，冀鲁豫前线大战即将爆发。
    我英勇的前线将士，在刘司令员、邓政委英明指挥下，不惜流血牺牲，取得了很多光辉的胜利，今后将继大杨湖、塔儿山以及各次战役中先烈的精神，为保卫解放区人民的生命财产与全国和平民主事业，将争取更多的胜利。但是自己高度的士气与必胜的决心，还必须有充分的物资保证，因此，后方工作的加强，就成为今后争取胜利的重要环节。
    自卫战争以来，我区人民充分表现了敌忾同仇的气概，参军参战、组织担架运输、加紧生产等等支援前线的运动普遍展开，如冀鲁豫南华涌现大批参战英雄，定陶加强后勤工作以及同蒲沿线人民之积极参战等模范事迹，已屡见不鲜，这是解放区实现耕者有其田的成果，是解放区人民觉悟程度提高的表现，但是，我们还不能因此自满，更不能因两月来陇海两次大捷及同蒲线的伟大胜利而骄傲松懈，反之，必须深刻认识目前战局的严重性，必须认识战争的长期性与艰苦性，后方工作，必须与前线密切配合，必须有严密的组织工作与坚强的领导，一切工作，都应为了前线的胜利而百倍奋发，以便与蒋介石好战集团作长期的艰苦斗争。
    后方工作人员，必须像前线将士一样，用战斗的精神，提高工作效率，克服麻痹侥幸心理，克服浪费敷衍的残余陋习。因此，第一、后方工作要保证做好，一切适应战争需要，工厂作坊增加生产提高质量，农民突击秋收，把一切力量都集中到争取前线胜利上去！第二、加紧组织一切可用的力量进行运输，保证前方供应，因为前线数十万将士在与敌人搏斗争取胜利中，物质的供应是不可缺少，而且消耗十分巨大，虽然我英勇将士，也曾经常在物质极端困难的情况下杀敌制胜，但在大规模的战争中，如果军需品的供应稍迟，往往会推迟胜利甚至影响胜利，而这些巨大数量军需品的运输以及伤员担架，都需要庞大的运输力，而这运输力的组织与动员，又必须经过细密的工作。
    我们应立即响应杨主席的号召，除动员解放区人民更踊跃参加担架运输外，各级政府，必须立即检查后方勤务工作；所有后勤机关，亦必加紧改进工作，使这一工作更有效更科学更准确，把广大参战群众，有条不紊的组织起来，把他们的力量发挥到最高度，我们不仅要争取时日，而且要争取时间，把军需粮秣一分钟都不迟延地运上前线去！
