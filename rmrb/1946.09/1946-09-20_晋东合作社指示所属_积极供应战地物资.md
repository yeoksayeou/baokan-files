　　Jindong Cooperative Directs Subordinates to Actively Supply Warfront Materials
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, 17th dispatch] The Jindong area cooperatives are actively supporting the front lines. The Jindong Cooperative recently issued an urgent directive to its subordinate Left Right, Wuxiang, Yushe, Heshun, Xiyang, Yuci, Taigu, Pingding, Shouyang, Qi County and other county federations, stating: In order to support the self-defense war, cooperatives in all counties, districts, and villages should strive to meet the needs of the military and civilians in combat. The following decisions have been made: (1) Cooperatives in combat areas should make every effort to supply and regulate the necessities of the army and local people at low prices to prevent price increases, so that the military and civilians in the war zone do not feel hardship. Cooperatives in areas where troops are stationed should take the initiative to maintain contact with the troops to supply necessities. (2) After cooperatives in temporarily occupied areas are transferred with government personnel, they should immediately contact the local cooperatives to continue to carry out business, and carry out economic struggles with stubborn pseudo-elements, and are not allowed to use the excuse of protecting materials to break away from the masses and break away from the struggle. (3) Cooperatives in newly liberated areas should make every effort to assist the government in post-war work and restore local commerce and production. (4) Universally launch production, especially the textile movement, to enrich the material foundation for self-defense. Cooperatives should become the vanguard of the national goods movement and assist in eradicating non-essential foreign goods.
