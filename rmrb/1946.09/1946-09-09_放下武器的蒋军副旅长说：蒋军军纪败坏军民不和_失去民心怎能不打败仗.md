　　Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 6th: Liu Guangguo, a Kuomintang army Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 99th Brigade (formerly a division) who laid down his arms in the Fenjie battle on the Rugao-Chuqiao line on August 26, said to reporters a few days ago with emotion: "Who wants to fight a civil war? What good is it to fight back and forth after working for decades? We have never collapsed like this before. This time, we went deep into enemy territory, and the people fled as soon as we arrived. It was like being blind. How could we not be defeated? Our senior officials are all from the Army Academy and have no practical knowledge. They only know how to draw circles on the map. Our superiors don't understand the situation at all." He said: "We are completely forced to fight the civil war. The military discipline is corrupt, the military and civilians are in discord, and the military and government are in discord. There will be reorganizations this September. Who still wants to fight?" Mr. Liu praised: "The New Fourth Army is mobile in combat, has high morale, and strict discipline"; and highly praised the good relationship between the military and civilians in the liberated areas.

　　放下武器的蒋军副旅长说：
    蒋军军纪败坏军民不和
    失去民心怎能不打败仗
    【新华社苏中前线六日电】八月二十六日如（皋）楚（桥）线分界战斗中放下武器之蒋军九十九旅（原师改称）副旅长刘光国少将日前对记者感慨地说：“那个愿意打内战？干了几十年，打来打去有什么好处？我们从来没有这样垮过，这次孤军深入，到一个地方老百姓都逃光，像瞎子一样，怎么不打败仗？我们那些高级官员都是陆军学校出来的，毫无实际知识，只晓得在地图上划划圈子。我们上级对情况一点不了解。”他说：“我们打内战完全是被逼迫的，军纪败坏，军民不和，军政不和。今年九月还要整编，谁还有心打仗？”刘氏称誉：“新四军作战机动，士气旺盛，纪律严明”；并盛赞解放区军民关系好。
