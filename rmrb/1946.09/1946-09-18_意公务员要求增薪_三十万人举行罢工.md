Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Milan dispatch: Thirty thousand Italian civil servants, demanding a doubling of their salaries, went on strike on the previous day, under the call of the Civil Servants' Joint General Committee (composed of various civil servant groups, including senior officials). Milan is a typical strike city, with 15,000 strikers. Striking civil servants include those from finance, taxation, and the judiciary, causing tax collection and litigation to come to a standstill. Nationalized institutions for disbursement, and distribution of salt, cigarettes, and postage stamp production have all closed down. The strike has affected 28 provinces north of the Po River and spread on the night of the 11th to other northern cities and southern areas such as Taranto and Brindisi. The Executive Committee of the Workers' Union Federation passed a resolution on the 11th, preparing to expand the current strike nationwide unless the government agrees to the demand for wage increases. The secretary of the Federation, Vittorio, has issued a warning to the government in Rome. Italian Prime Minister Gasperi met with labor leaders on the morning of the 11th to resolve their demands.

    三十万人举行罢工
    【新华社延安十二日电】米兰讯：意三十万公务人员因要求增薪资一倍，在公务员各区联总委员会（为各种公务员之团体所组成，包括高级官员在内）号召下，已于日前举行罢工。米兰是罢工城市中之典型，罢工者共达一万五千人。罢工的公务员包括财政、税收、司法在内，征税及理讼均陷于停顿，出纳及分配食盐、香烟、造邮票之国营机关都已关门。罢工已影响波河以北二十八省，并于十一日夜蔓延至北方其他各城及南方之托兰多、布林的西等地。职工联合会执行委员会十一日通过决议，除非政府答应增加工资的要求，即准备扩大目前的罢工至全国。该会书记维托尼奥于罗马已向政府发出警告，意总理加斯贝利十一日晨接见劳工领袖，以解决他们的要求。
