[Front Line of Longhai Reporter Group, 11th Dispatch] Fang Shuhe, a soldier from the machine gun company of the 2nd Battalion, 58th Regiment, 20th Brigade, 3rd Division of the Chiang army, who had just laid down his weapons, accused Chiang Kai-shek of his crimes to his liberators – the Eighth Route Army comrades. He said, "I am seventeen years old this year, from Luoyang. In February, I went to the field to cut grass and was arrested to be a soldier. I have been in the army for half a year, and I only received two payments, one for five thousand yuan and the other for four thousand yuan, both discounted until nothing was left. This time we set off, the officers told us to rush overnight, carrying a rifle and one hundred and fifty bullets on our backs, which was really suffocating. Everyone was unwilling to fight in the civil war. When we set off, the whole company had a total of one hundred and twenty people. When we came to the front line, only seventy brothers were left. The rest all deserted. The officers often told us: 'The Eighth Route Army will not let you live if you are caught, either beheading or burying alive!' The brothers were all afraid of being captured. Last night the shooting was very tight, and we all hid in a house and dared not move. In the end, the battalion commander and deputy battalion commander took up machine guns and fired two bursts of bullets and ran away. When we were captured, we were very scared at first, thinking that we would be beheaded or buried alive. Unexpectedly, the Eighth Route Army treated me so well. I realized that the officers were deceiving us." Hu Jinsheng was liberated on the evening of August 10th in the battle of Lanfeng. After a few days of education and enlightenment by veteran soldiers, his class consciousness dispelled Chiang Kai-shek's deception of him. He picked up his weapon and went back to fight Old Chiang. In every battle, no matter how fierce the enemy's artillery fire was, he carried the ammunition box and always followed the squad leader. He cherished the ammunition box very much. He picked up the bullets that others dropped. After attacking Qixian and rushing to the city, he rushed to the enemy empty-handed. When the enemy discovered him, he had already snatched the enemy's gun. In the end, the enemy had no choice but to unconditionally hand over the ammunition bag containing more than one hundred bullets to him.

[Report from this newspaper's Tang Detachment, 10th] On August 28th, the stubborn 40th Army, in coordination with the "Returning Home Corps," attacked Haojiagang on the border of Tangyin. They immediately engaged in fierce fighting with our armed work team. Because of our strong fighting will, the enemy's demoralized 40th Army collapsed at the first touch and fled eastward. Our Militia Detachment × unit took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing twelve enemies and wounding ten. We captured two Type 38 rifles, eighty-five bullets, and eight hand grenades. We suffered no casualties except for the consumption of some ammunition. (Hui Tian)

[Another Dispatch] Comrade Han Zhongli (16 years old), a young bugler of the Fourth District Cadre Team, was operating with his unit in Xiangsi on August 18th when he discovered several plainclothes Kuomintang secret agents. After the unit ambushed, they asked him to blow the assembly call. He thought, "They are the Central Army, so I will blow the Central Army's bugle call!" So he started to blow the "De de da da" tune. Sure enough, eight plainclothes men assembled and entered our encirclement. The unit rushed over, and without wasting a single bullet, all eight plainclothes men were captured alive. We also obtained a long gun and a six-round pistol. (Hui Tian)

　　放下武器控诉蒋介石
    重上战场保卫和平
    汤支队保卫解放区出击告捷
    【陇海前线记者团十一日电】刚放下武器的蒋军第三师廿旅五十八团二营机枪连士兵方书和就向他的解放者——八路军同志们，控诉蒋介石的罪行，他说：“我今年十七岁，洛阳人，二月间去地里割草，被抓去当了兵，在队伍上干了半年，只发了两次饷，一回是五千元，一回四千元，都是七折八扣，扣个光。这次出发，官长叫连夜赶，背了一支步枪，还背上一百五十发子弹，真压的喘不过气来。大家都不愿打内战，出发时全连共一百二十个人，来到前线，只剩下七十个弟兄，其余全部开小差跑了，当官长的经常对我们说：“八路军捉住没有活命，不是砍头，就是活埋”！弟兄听了都害怕当俘虏，昨晚上枪打得很紧，我们都钻在一个房子里不敢动，打到最后，营长和营副端上机枪打了两梭子弹就跑了。我们当了俘虏，开始非常害怕，以为就要砍头或活埋，想不到八路军对我这样好，我才知道官长是欺骗我们的。”胡金生是八月十日晚上兰封战斗中解放出来，经过老战士几天的教育启发，他的阶级觉悟解除了蒋介石对他的欺骗，他就拿起武器回头去打老蒋，在历次战斗中不管敌人炮火怎样凶，他扛着子弹箱，始终跟着班长，他对子弹箱非常爱惜，别人掉了的子弹，他都拾起来，攻杞县冲上城后，赤手空拳冲到敌人跟前，敌人发现他时已经把敌人的枪夺过手来了，最后敌人只好无条件放下装有百余发子弹的子弹袋交给他。
    【本报汤支十日讯】八月二十八日，顽四十军，配合“还乡团”向我汤阴边地郝家岗进攻，当即与我武工队展开激战，由于我们战斗意志的坚强，敌斗志颓衰的四十军一触即溃，向东逃窜，我民连支队×部乘胜追击，毙死敌十二名，伤十名，我缴获三八式步枪两枝，子弹八十五发，手榴弹八个，我除消耗弹药一部分外，毫无伤亡。（惠田）
    【又讯】四区干队小司号员，韩中立同志（十六岁），八月十八日跟部队活动到香寺，发现顽伪几个便衣，部队埋伏好后，让他吹集合号，他一想，他们是中央军，我就吹中央军的号排子吧！”于是他的的答答吹起来，果然集合来了八个便衣，进入了我们的包围圈，部队猛冲过去，没费一粒子弹，八个便衣完全被我们活捉了，并得长枪一枝六轮枪一枝。（惠田）
