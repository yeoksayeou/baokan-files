　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 15th, announcing the victory of the strike by more than 500,000 Japanese railway workers. This strike was to oppose the post-war dismissal of a large number of railway workers. The statement called on workers in all other industries throughout Japan to rise up and carry out a common struggle like the railway workers, in order to win the victory against post-war dismissals. The statement also stated that the Communist Party will fight for other labor goals, including striving for exemption from income tax. According to United Press, the victory of the railway strike has further enhanced the position of the Japanese Communist Party in the Japanese labor movement, because the Japanese Railway Workers' Union (one of the largest unions in Japan) was originally under the leadership of the Socialist Party. Due to the Socialist Party leaders' opposition to the railway strike, the union will therefore be led by the Communist Party and will gain the unanimous support of the workers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Tokyo Dispatch: According to Japanese newspaper reports: On the 15th, the total number of Japanese seamen on strike increased by 50% compared to the 14th. In Yokohama port, four more of the six ships preparing to set sail responded to the strike of another eight ships. The seamen on two large ships and forty speedboats anchored near Yokosuka also went on strike on the 15th. In Kobe, although the trade union led by the left wing of the Socialist Party prohibited the seamen's strike and announced that it would severely punish the strikers, a large number of seamen still refused to obey orders and abandoned ship to strike. According to Japanese newspapers, many of the ships on strike are "Liberty" ships lent to Japan by the United States.

　　日共宣布
    铁路工人大罢工胜利
    日海员工潮继续扩大中
    【新华社延安十六日电】据合众社东京电：日本共产党十五日发表声明，宣布日本五十余万铁路工人大罢工的胜利。此次罢工，是为了反对战后解雇大批铁路工人。该声明号召全日本的其他各业工人也像铁路工人一样起来进行共同的斗争，以争取反对战后解雇的胜利。声明又称：共产党将为其他的劳工目的包括争取免除支付所得税而斗争。据合众社透露：铁路罢工的胜利已使日共在日本劳工运动中的地位更进一步提高，因日铁路工会（日最大工会之一）原在社会党领导之下，由于社会党领导分子反对铁路罢工，该工会将因而由共产党领导，并获得工人的一致拥护。
    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：据日本报纸消息：十五日日本海员罢工总数已较十四日增加百分之五十，横滨港内六艘准备起航的轮船中又有四艘响应另八艘船的罢工。停在横须贺附近的两艘大船与四十艘快艇的海员，也于十五日罢工。神户力面，虽然社会党左翼领导的职工会禁止海员罢工，并宣布将严惩罢工者，但仍有甚大一部分海员拒绝服从命令，弃船罢工。据日本报纸称：罢工的船只中很多是美国借给日本的“自由式”轮船。
