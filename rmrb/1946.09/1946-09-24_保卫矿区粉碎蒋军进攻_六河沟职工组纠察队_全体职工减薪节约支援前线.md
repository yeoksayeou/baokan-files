　　Defend the Mining Area and Smash the Chiang Kai-shek Troops' Offensive
    Liuhugou Workers' Group Militia
    All Workers Reduce Wages and Economize to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] Amidst the tense situation of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in Anyang launching a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas such as Qugou, the workers of the Liuhugou mining area are extremely indignant. Under the slogan "Defend our mining area, smash Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war offensive," they have launched a fervent war preparedness and self-defense movement. Under the leadership of the administration and the trade union, all workers first carried out ideological mobilization and self-examination, breaking through complacency. They strengthened their confidence in victory, and all units carried out full war preparedness work, establishing groups for transporting and transferring manpower and materials, and for transferring and repairing workers' families, etc., which were carried out in a very planned and organized manner, and the workers' morale was very high. When the administration and the trade union called on everyone to actively participate in the militia to defend the mine and launch guerrilla warfare, all the workers responded enthusiastically, with more than 300 vying to participate, fully demonstrating the high awareness of the working class. Five detachments were immediately established, and everyone sharpened their knives and guns, stayed up day and night, and patrolled and guarded very closely. On September 2nd, they discovered a special agent named Guo Youfu, sent by puppet Wang Ziquan specifically to sabotage our Liuhugou mining area. At the same time, it was proposed to combine war preparedness with production. The militia members work during the day and patrol at night. Ma Shuangxi and Su Guilai, members of the second detachment, actively helped repair the militia's weapons. The two of them alone repaired eight or nine guns. Comrade Wu Yuxiang played an even more active leading role.
    Moreover, the mining area has recently proposed the slogan of saving food and clothing to support the patriotic self-defense war on the front lines, which has immediately received the response of all workers. They have unanimously displayed the spirit of hardship during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and have taken the initiative to request wage reductions. Most cadres have reduced their wages by more than 80 catties of millet, and Principal Li of the school has repeatedly requested wage reductions. There have also been great achievements in terms of economy. Everyone is shouting a slogan: everything for the front lines.
