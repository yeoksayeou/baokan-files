　　Emancipated Peasants Rejoice
　　Wangjiadui River Village Holds Celebration Meeting, Xiaopingying Farmers Sing Praises of Chairman Mao
Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 25th—The 105 poor peasant households and 33 middle peasant households of Wangjiadui River Village, south of Linyi City, after fairly and reasonably distributing 559 mu of land from traitors and despots, specifically held a celebration meeting currently to celebrate "Land Returning Home." For the first two days, the entire village invited four teachers to busy themselves writing documents and land deeds. A high platform was erected in the square, and the literacy class was practicing newly arranged Yangge dances, with infinite joy revealed on everyone's face. On the day of the meeting, the peasants stopped working in the fields for this once-in-a-lifetime great joy. In the morning, after a burst of Western-style bugle calls, the masses of the entire village gathered at the meeting place. The literacy class, wearing brightly colored clothes, danced the Yangge accompanied by the national band. The militia team and children's corps lined up on both sides. Amidst three celebratory cannon salutes, the entire crowd, organized by worker, peasant, youth, and women's groups, marched in formation, led by the banner "Wangjiadui Celebration of Emancipation Meeting," beating eighteen large and small gongs and drums, heading towards villages such as Huangjiadui River and Sun Xueyin River. Each time they arrived at a village, three cannon salutes were fired, and Yangge dances were performed. The masses of Sunjiadui River specially prepared tea and snacks to welcome them. The large group returned to their own village only in the evening. After dinner, the official celebration meeting began. Masses from villages within ten li of the surrounding area all rushed to participate in the meeting. First, amidst music, the girls from the literacy class presented flowers to the huge images of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Then, they paid respects to the martyrs who died on the self-defense front to protect their hometown. Chairman Mo Sangchun spoke: "Today is a joyful and happy meeting. After obtaining the land, we must strive to produce more harvests to ensure the final victory of the self-defense war." The militia instructor and the director of the women's association proposed to unite closely, intensify sentry duty, and strive to support the front lines, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Representatives from guest villages were also invited to speak, unanimously expressing: "The poor have been emancipated, with both houses and land. We have a large population and great strength, and we will definitely be able to defeat the reactionaries." The shouts of slogans from the crowd below rose and fell, and many young people shouted themselves hoarse, while the old women shed tears of excitement. Jubilation filled the entire venue, and the meeting was adjourned only late at night.
    
    [This newspaper's Linzhang News] After the complete reckoning with the "Six Big Households" of evil despotic landlords, the peasants of Xiaopingying have been completely emancipated; the entire village has also taken on a new look. The "Six Big Households," led by "Glass Head" Zhang Huaide, ruled the village for decades, exploiting the peasants with high rents and heavy interest, extorting and embezzling countless village funds. This June, the emancipation team arrived in the village, re-integrating with local cadres to organize the masses to pour out their grievances, settle accounts, find the roots of poverty, and call for complete emancipation. After two months of networking and deliberation, in late August, they finally launched a continuous total reckoning with the "Six Big Households" of evil despotic landlords, exposing all their crimes of embezzlement, extortion, and illegal exploitation. Zhang Huaide, the head, alone was liable to compensate the masses eight million two hundred thousand yuan. Converting the money into land, 82 peasant households recovered a total of 586 mu of land from the "Six Big Households," with each household averaging 7.1 mu of land. Out of the entire village, nine extremely poor households and five households were elevated to poor peasant status, four households were elevated to middle peasant status; forty-three of the seventy-one poor peasant households were elevated to middle peasant status. In addition, two middle peasant households were elevated to wealthy middle peasant status. Now the emancipated peasants are all starting to harvest the autumn crops on their own land with great enthusiasm. Hei Baoniang's family of four, picking cotton on the twelve mu of land they had recovered, sang, "Chairman Mao is like a bright lamp on a high mountain." Tenant Jing Chunhua, driving a cart full of cotton from the field edge, approached the door of one of the six big households, "Cao Cao" Jing Zhefu, and the livestock sharply swerved into Jing's alley. The peasants on the street burst into laughter. Jing Chunhua also laughed and said: Now, "the reins are in our hands! What we planted ourselves, we should haul to our own home!" As the peasants said, today they have "taken root" (have land) and "taken charge" (are in charge of the household), so they should laugh heartily!

　　翻身农民欢欣鼓舞
　　王家对河村开庆祝大会小平营农户歌唱毛主席
    【新华社临沂二十五日电】临沂城南王家对河村一百零五户贫农及三十三户中农，于公平合理地分得汉奸恶霸的五百五十九亩土地后，特于目前举行庆祝“土地回老家”大会。头两天全庄请了四位先生忙着写文书地契。广场上搭起高台，识字班在练习新排的秧歌，人人脸上都流露着无限的欢乐。开会的一天，农民们为这个千万年没有的大喜事停止下地，上午一阵洋号声后，全庄群众即齐集会场，识字班穿着五色灿烂的衣服在国乐队伴奏下，扭着秧歌舞，民兵队儿童团排列在两旁，在三响喜炮声中，全体群众按工农青妇团体，整队出发游行，高举着“王家对河庆祝翻身大会”的大旗为前导，敲打着十八面大小锣鼓，向黄家对河、孙学寅对河等村进发，每到一庄，即鸣炮三响，并表演秧歌、孙家对河群众特备茶点欢迎，大队直至旁晚始返回本村。晚饭后正式开庆祝大会，附近十里内外各村群众，都赶来参加大会。首先在乐声中由识字班姑娘们向毛主席、朱总司令巨像献花，其次向为保卫他们家乡在自卫前线死难的烈士致哀。主席莫桑春讲话：“今天是个大欢喜的快乐会，得到土地后要努力生产多收成，以保证自卫战最后的胜利。”民兵指导员和妇女会主任提出要亲密团结，加紧站岗放哨，努力支援前线，打垮蒋介石的进攻，各村来宾代表也被邀讲话，一致表示：“穷人翻了身，有房也有地，我们人多力量大，一定能把反动派打垮。”台下群众口号声此伏彼起，好多年青人都喊哑了喉咙，年老的大娘们则流着兴奋的眼泪，狂欢洋溢着全场，直至深夜始宣告散会。
    【本报临漳讯】小平营农民向“六大户”恶霸地主的总清算后，已获彻底翻身；全村亦气象一新。“六大户”以“琉璃头”张怀德为首，统治该村数十年，高租重利盘剥农民、敲诈勒索与贪污村款无数。今年六月翻身队到了该村，重新结合当地干部，组织群众诉苦，算帐，找穷根，号召彻底翻身。经两个月的串连酝酿，终于在八月下旬展开连续对“六大户”恶霸地主的总清算，将他们贪污、敲诈、非法剥削的罪恶全部揭发出来，为首的张怀德一人应赔偿群众八百二十万元。将款折地，八十二户农民共从“六大户”手里收回土地五百八十六亩，每户平均得地七亩一分。全村九户赤贫五户升为贫农，四户升为中农；七十一户贫农中的四十三户升为中农。另有二户中农升为富裕中农。现翻身农民都开始兴致勃勃的在自己土地上收秋。黑保娘一家四口在收回的十二亩地上摘的棉花，歌唱着“毛主席好比那高山明灯”。佃户景春花赶着一辆满载棉花的大车从地塘边走近六大户之一“曹操”景折福的门前，牲口狠狠一拐就拐进景家巷来了，街上农民烘然大笑。景春花也笑起来说：如今“缰绳拉在咱手啦！咱自己种下的东西，该往咱家拉啦！”如农民所说，今天自己“札了根”（有了地），“拿了事”（当了家），应该衷心地欢笑啦！
