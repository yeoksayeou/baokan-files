Six Hundred Thousand Peasants Eagerly Demand Land; Northern Henan Promotes "Land to the Tiller"
Peasant Mutual Aid Movement Spreads Throughout Villages in Half a Month; Peasants Fleeing to Shaanxi and Anhui Return to Participate in Liquidation

[Our Newspaper Changzhi 20th Dispatch] In the half-month since the end of August, the liquidation struggle of 600,000 people in Bo’ai, Qinyang, Wenxian, Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, Wuzhi and other counties and cities in northern Henan has been universally launched, and some areas have initially achieved "land to the tiller." According to Comrade Hou Songlin of the Wenxian County Party Committee, only nine days after the movement was deployed, more than half of the villages in the county had re-engaged in struggle. The momentum is unprecedented, and the enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedented. In these counties, the mass movement had disappeared for two months after the wheat harvest. After the District Party Committee issued the call to "meet the peasants' land demands," each county convened large-scale meetings of village cadres and activists in mid-August to mobilize. County and district cadres also conducted ideological self-criticism and studied the basic reasons why the movement in the first half of the year could not be deepened. They liquidated the erroneous idea that "land in northern Henan is not concentrated and the land problem is not serious," as well as the leadership's failure to be bold and to boldly support the peasants' urgent land demands. In rent reduction and interest rate reduction, they only emphasized signing contracts to protect tenants and did not emphasize thorough liquidation, so that the masses did not achieve economic emancipation. Large tracts of fertile land and manors, and even village political power, were still in the hands of landlords, who continued to exploit the peasants. The masses reflected that they had "turned over empty-handed," "turned over halfway," and the threat of "change of dynasty" was difficult to eliminate. Cadres were entangled in the issue of how to mobilize the masses, and the situation could not be opened up, and they became depressed and dispirited. This time, the principle of "land to the tiller" was announced at the activists' meeting and was immediately welcomed by everyone. The Bo'ai meeting had not yet ended, and the village cadres and activists were eager to return to their villages to lead the struggle. They said, "This is great! We have to make a big turnaround! Those good lands that the landlords took from us should be given back to us to cultivate!" Everyone said, "This time, we will completely turn over when we take back the 'treasure pot' (land)!" When the cadres saw that the peasants' land demands were so urgent and their support for the new policy was so enthusiastic, they suddenly became enlightened and full of energy. Therefore, as soon as the meeting ended and the cadres returned to the villages, the fire of emancipation immediately swept across the northern Henan plains. More than 600,000 peasants immediately joined the movement. The slogan "Dig out the old roots of poverty and bring back the treasure pot" resounded throughout every village. In many villages, they started working the night the cadres returned to the village. One can imagine their eagerness. In the fourth district of Wenxian County, more than 40 villages almost all re-engaged in struggle in nine days. Through liquidation, the peasants recovered more than 2,200 mu of land. In the fifth district, 24 villages started fighting in seven days, involving more than 10,000 peasants, recovering more than 1,300 mu of land. Many peasants who were forced to flee during the period of stubborn puppet rule returned from Anhui, Shaanxi and other places after hearing the news to participate in the liquidation struggle and recover the land that had been forcibly occupied. In the fourth and sixth districts of Bo'ai, 43 villages launched struggles in half a month. The peasants forced Zhang Chunlin, a stubborn local tyrant and big landlord, to lower his head through joint struggles, recovering a lot of land. When the peasants in Zhuanjing Village, Bo'ai, recovered their land, they spent two days making sure they got back the deeds. Peasants centered on Dalouzhuang in Qinyang and Bo'ai and the Hui and Han people in 23 villages jointly defeated Bai Zi, the head of the former Qinxian puppet "Greater East Asia Islamic Youth Corps," and Yan Wenzhang, Yan Wenming, and others, who were famous Hui traitors. The Hui and Han peasants were liberated together. Dozens of villages in Xiwancun, Yizhuang, Wangcun, and Shanwangzhuang in Chengguan, Qinyang, more than ten villages and towns such as Encun Town and Zaodian in Jiaozuo City, the Daiwang area near the Jiang-controlled area in Xiuwu, and the Daxiaohongzhuang area in Wuzhi have all generally entered into a fierce liquidation movement. Peasants in various counties, districts, and villages acted simultaneously, supporting each other, and fiercely attacked all the remnants of traitors and feudal bullies. The momentum was extremely vast, breaking the leadership's consistent practice of moving slowly from point to surface. The reasons for the rapid, fierce and large-scale nature of this movement, in addition to the encouragement of the new slogan to the peasants and the leadership's grasp of the principle of boldly launching, are also the weakening of feudal and traitorous forces, the organization of the vast number of peasants, the establishment of militias, the suppression of special agents and black gunners, and the establishment of a new order of mass advantage in the movement in the first half of the year. At present, peasant association organizations and militias are rapidly expanding in various places. The chairman of the peasant association in Zhuanjing Village, Bo'ai, said: "Don't be afraid of changes in the political climate, we will recover our land anyway." The emancipated peasants are no longer afraid of "changes in the political climate" and are determined to use their own strength to defend the liberated areas.

　　六十万农民迫切要求土地
    豫北推进耕者有其田
    农民互相支援运动半月遍及各村逃往陕皖农民纷纷归来参加清算
    【本报长治二十日电】八月底以来的半月间，豫北博爱、沁阳、温县、修武、焦作、武陟等县市六十万群众的清算斗争，已普遍展开，部分地区已初步达到耕者有其田。据温县县委侯松林同志谈，此次运动布置下去才九天，重新斗争起来的村庄已达全县半数以上。来势之猛，群众情绪之高，为前所未有。这几县在麦收以后，群运曾消失两月。区党委关于“满足农民土地要求”的号召发出后，各县均于八月中旬，大规模召开村干部积极分子会议进行动员。县区干部亦同时作了思想检查，并研究了前半年运动不能深入的基本原因，清算了“豫北土地不集中、土地问题不严重”的错误思想，以及领导上不敢大胆放手，对农民迫切的土地要求不敢大胆支持，而在减租减息上，只强调订约保佃，不强调彻底清算，以致群众未从经济上获得翻身。大片肥沃的土地与田园，甚至村的政权，仍掌握在地主之手，继续对农民进行压榨。群众则反映“翻了个空身”，“翻了半个身”，“变天”威胁难于解除。干部纠缠于发动群众的方式问题，一直打不开局面，亦由苦闷而消沉。此次在积极分子会议中，耕者有其田的方针一经宣布，即获全体欢迎。博爱的会议还未结束，村干部与积极分子即急着回村领导斗争。他们说：“这一下可好了！咱得来个大翻身！地主们夺了咱的那些好地，又该让咱们自己种啦！”大家都说：“这回把聚宝盆（土地）收回来就彻底翻身了！”干部见农民土地要求如此迫切，对新方针的拥护如此热烈，思想豁然开朗，精神百倍。因之会议一结束，干部一回村，翻身的大火立即燃遍豫北原野。六十余万农民立即卷入运动。“挖掉老穷根，端回聚宝盆”的口号，响遍每一村庄。许多村庄，都是干部回村的当夜就干起来了。其迫不及待之情可以想见。温县四区四十余村，九天中几全部重新斗争起来。农民经过清算，收回土地二千二百余亩。五区七天就有二十四村斗争起来，万余农民卷入运动，收回土地一千三百余亩。许多在顽伪统治时期被迫逃荒出走的农民，都由安徽、陕西等地闻风归来，参加清算斗争，收回被强霸的土地。博爱四、六区，半月间有四十三村掀起斗争，农民以联合斗争迫使顽强的恶霸大地主张春林低了头，收回很多土地。博爱砖井村农民收回土地时，费了两天工夫，一定要把契纸要过来。沁阳、博爱以大楼庄为中心的农民和二十三村的回汉民，联合打垮有名的回奸前沁县伪“兴亚回教青年团”团长拜子及阎文章、阎文鸣等，回汉农民同获解放。沁阳城关西万村、义庄、王村、山王庄等数十村，焦作市的恩村镇，造店等十余村镇，修武接近蒋管区的待王一带，武陟的大小红庄一带，均普遍进入了猛烈的清算运动。各县各区村农民同时动作，互相支援，向一切汉奸余孽及封建恶霸猛力冲击，声势极为浩大，打破了领导上由点到面，慢慢推动的一贯作法。此次运动如此迅速猛烈，规模如此宏大，除了新口号对农民的鼓舞、领导上掌握了大胆放手发动方针外，前半年运动中削弱了封建与奸伪力量，组织了广大农民，建立了民兵，镇压了特务黑枪手，建立了群众优势的新秩序，亦为重要原因，现各地农会组织与民兵正迅速扩大。博爱砖井村农会主席说：“不怕天变，反正要收回咱们的土地。”翻身农民已不再怕“变天”，而决心以自己的力量来保卫解放区。
