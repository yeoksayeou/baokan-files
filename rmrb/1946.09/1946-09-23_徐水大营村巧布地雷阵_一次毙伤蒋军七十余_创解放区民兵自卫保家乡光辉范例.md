Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 20th: On August 29th, militiamen from Da Ying Village, Xushui, along the Ping-Han Railway, killed and wounded over seventy Chiang soldiers using "rooftop mines" and "camouflaged mines." The remaining hundred-plus soldiers, along with reinforcements, fled back to Baoding overnight. This is one of the brilliant examples of militias defending their homes in the liberated areas. On that day at dawn, the Kuomintang army's "punitive force" surrounded Da Ying Village. Fearing landmines, they climbed into the village through breaches in the walls in several remote locations. The whole village was quiet, with no sign of activity. As a dozen or so Chiang soldiers were squatting under a large jujube tree, peeking around, a mine hanging from a branch exploded, instantly obliterating nine Chiang soldiers beyond recognition. A group of Chiang soldiers who entered the northeast alley came to a corner, and a loud noise came from above. Several Chiang soldiers fell there forever. The village remained silent for a long time. Half an hour later, a team of Chiang soldiers entered the small alley in the southeast corner, shouting, "What are you afraid of? Watch your heads and charge in together. Anyone who doesn't charge will be shot!" The Chiang soldiers advanced, but unexpectedly, three landmines exploded in succession on the stone slabs, and eight more Chiang soldiers were blown down. Terrified by the power of the mines, the Chiang soldiers changed their approach after noon, climbing onto the roofs of civilian houses from the north to attack. The militiamen cleverly placed mines under the eaves of houses in several key locations and retreated into the houses. Just as the Chiang soldiers were triumphantly advancing across a rooftop, two loud explosions suddenly rang out, and the Chiang soldiers fell into the courtyards and streets, turning into piles of minced meat. In the evening, Chiang reinforcements arrived with an armored car, two mortars, and over two hundred Chiang soldiers, charging fiercely into the streets and alleys from all directions. At this moment, there was a bang in the east and a burst of fire in the west, and thirty or forty Chiang soldiers became unwilling ghosts in the minefield. When the Chiang soldiers rushed to the old Dongmiao temple in the center of the street, they saw two toy-like stone houses placed in the street. The soldiers looked at each other, not knowing what they were. As some of the more daring soldiers were gathering around to investigate, there was a loud bang, and iron and stone shattered, blowing down another seven soldiers. The Chiang soldiers then covered the wounded and hurriedly retreated.

　　徐水大营村巧布地雷阵
    一次毙伤蒋军七十余
    创解放区民兵自卫保家乡光辉范例
    【新华社张家口二十日电】上月二十九日，平汉沿线徐水大营村民兵以“屋顶雷”、“伪装雷”等，毙伤了七十多名蒋军，其余一百多名随同援军连夜逃回保定，这是解放区民兵自卫保家乡的光辉范例之一。是日黎明，国民党军“讨伐队”，把大营村团团包围，因为怕踩着地雷，故由几处偏僻地方的缺墙爬进村里来，全村静悄悄的不见一点动静，十几名蒋军正蹲在一棵大枣树下窥探时，一个悬挂在桠杈上的地雷爆炸了，九个蒋军登时被炸得找不见了尸身。进到东北巷里的一伙蒋军，走到拐湾处，头顶上一声巨响，几个蒋军便又永远横倒在那里了。村中好久没有动静，隔了半个钟头，一队蒋军又进入了东南角的小胡同里，只听呐喊道：“怕什么，小心头上一齐往里冲，谁不冲就枪毙”。蒋军前进了，不料石板上接连响了三个地雷，八个蒋军官兵又被炸倒在那里。蒋军为地雷威力所惊慑，过了晌午，乃改变方法，从北面爬上了民房顶进攻，民兵们机警的在几处要道的房檐下安下地雷，退到房里去了。蒋军正得意扬扬越过一座房顶前进间，突然两声巨响，蒋军应声纷纷飞到院落里大街上，变成了一团肉泥。傍晚，蒋军增援来一辆装甲车，两门迫击炮和二百多名蒋军，气势凶凶的由四面冲进了街巷，这时东也轰的一响，西也开了朵火花，蒋军官兵三四十名又在地雷阵里做了屈死鬼。蒋军冲到街中心老东庙时，只见当街放着两座玩具似石头房子，官兵们面面相视，谁也不知道是什么。有胆大一些的正围拢研究的时候，轰地一声，铁石迸裂，又炸倒了七个，蒋军乃掩护伤兵匆忙撤退了。
