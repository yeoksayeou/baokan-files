(Handan, 23rd dispatch) "It's not worth it to die for Chiang Kai-shek. The Eighth Route Army won't make things difficult for us!" This one sentence saved 157 lives. On September 7th, when the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Eighth Route Army launched a self-defense counterattack and major annihilation battle in the Dingtao and Caoxian areas on the western front, Wei Suyuan, the deputy company commander of the anti-tank artillery company directly under the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division of the Kuomintang army (originally a unit that underwent renaming with the terms "army" and "division" being interchanged), who was operating in Taoyuan, southwest of Dingtao, at the critical moment of choosing between "living for justice and dying for the nation's sinners," finally decided to surrender to the people's army. He immediately gathered all the officers and soldiers of the company in a civilian house and told them the aforementioned sentence. As a result, except for a few who were lost, all 157 officers and soldiers laid down their weapons and safely entered the liberated area. The artillery unit of a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army specially held a symposium with the officers and soldiers of the company a few days ago to express their welcome. In a free and joyful atmosphere, the officers and soldiers of the anti-tank artillery company poured out their long-suppressed inner words, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to eliminate dissidents and wipe out "miscellaneous troops." The conversation then naturally turned to the story of "relying on the Communist Party for food." They said: After the reorganization in April this year, the surplus officer corps in Luohe, Henan, received a maximum of 10,000 yuan each for travel expenses and were immediately dismissed. Just as everyone was worried that the travel expenses were too small, a leaflet reading "What the Chiang family doesn't want, the Mao family wants" suddenly appeared in a market town 30 miles southeast of Luohe. At that time, it caused a sensation throughout the corps, and everyone was brewing "new ways out." Seeing the situation was not good, the Kuomintang authorities confiscated their guns overnight. Coincidentally, thanks to the guidance of the leaflets, we have now found a bright way out.

　　前线放下武器炮兵连官兵
    倾吐胸怀多年积郁控诉蒋家图灭杂牌
    【邯郸二十三日电】“犯不着替蒋介石卖命，八路军不会为难我们的!”这一句话挽救了一百五十七条生命。九月七日冀鲁豫八路军，在西线定陶、曹县地区展开自卫反击大歼灭战时，在定陶西南桃源作战的，国民党军四十一师一二二旅（原军与师改称）直属战防炮炮兵连副连长，卫素元在“为正义而生，为民族罪人而死”，必须择一而行的紧急关头，终于决心投向人民军队的怀抱，立即召集全连官兵至一民房内，将上述这句话告诉大家，结果除少数人失散外，百五十七名官兵全部放下武器，并安全开入解放区。八路军某部炮兵部队，特于日前与该连官兵举行座谈会，以表欢迎之忱，在自由欢快的气氛中，战防炮连官兵，尽情倾吐长久积郁在内心的话语，痛斥蒋介石排除异己，消灭杂牌的阴谋。谈话随后又自然地转到“靠共产党吃饭”的故事，他们说：今年四月整编后，河南漯河编余军官大队，每人最多只发一万元路费，并宣布立即遣散，正当大家发愁盘川太少时，漯河东南三十里一集镇忽发现“蒋家不要，毛家要”的传单，当时轰动全队，纷纷酝酿“新的出路”，国民党当局见势不妙，就连夜收枪。事情可凑巧，托福传单的指点，我们现在可找到光明的出路。
