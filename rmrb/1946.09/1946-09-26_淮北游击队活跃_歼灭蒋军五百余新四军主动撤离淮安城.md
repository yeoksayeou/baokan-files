According to incomplete statistics, guerrillas and militia in the Lingbi, Wuhe, Sixian, Suining, and Suxian areas killed, wounded, and captured a total of more than 520 Chiang troops, and seized more than 100 rifles, one light machine gun, and two military large boats in the week from August 29th to the 5th of this month.
