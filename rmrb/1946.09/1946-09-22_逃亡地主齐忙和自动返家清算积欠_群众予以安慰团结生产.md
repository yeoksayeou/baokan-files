　　Fleeing Landlord Qi Manghe
    Actively Returns Home to Settle Debts
    Masses Offer Comfort and Unite for Production
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 18th dispatch] Qi Manghe, a landlord from Baitucun, Jingxing, fled to the Kuomintang-controlled area last winter to avoid liquidation by the masses. After this movement began, village cadres explained the policies clearly to his family and persuaded him to return home and resolve his own problems. After his family went to persuade him, Qi returned to the village on August 25th. Upon seeing his return, the masses went to comfort him, expressing that as long as he could implement the policies, his past actions of evading liquidation would not be pursued. Qi was deeply moved and voluntarily used a portion of his family property to compensate the masses. The masses also took care of him. Qi said, "I was deceived by rumors in the past and fled outside. I suffered a lot there (in the Kuomintang-controlled area). If I had known everyone would be like this, I would never have gone." The masses repeatedly comforted him, guaranteeing his livelihood and uniting with him for production.

    【本报长治十八日电】井陉白土村地主齐忙和，去冬因躲避群众清算，逃往蒋管区。这次运动开始，经村干部向其家人将政策解释明白，劝其归家，主动解决自己问题。其家人前往劝说后，齐即于八月二十五日回村。群众见其归来，纷纷前往安慰，表示只要能够执行政策，对其逃避清算的行为不究既往。齐深为感动，当自动以一部家产偿还群众。群众并予以照顾，齐说：“我过去受谣言蒙蔽，逃到外边，在那里（蒋管区）受了许多磨难，早知大家如此，我怎么也不会去的。”群众又再三安慰，保证其生活，并与之团结生产。
