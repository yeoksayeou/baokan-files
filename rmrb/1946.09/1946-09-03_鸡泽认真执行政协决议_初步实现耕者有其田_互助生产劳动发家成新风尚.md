　　【Report from Wei County】After the liberation of Jize, 80,000 farmers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched a vigorous struggle for emancipation, overthrowing the feudal rule that had weighed on them for thousands of years and the eight years of enemy puppet and traitor rule, and initially realizing Sun Yat-sen's and the Political Consultative Conference's decision of "Land to the Tiller." According to a county-wide survey, farmers reclaimed 21,711 mu of land in the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement. In the anti-traitor and anti-hegemon struggle, 12,634 mu of land were recovered. In the land redemption movement, 6,371 mu of land were obtained. A total of 40,716 mu of land were recovered. Now, there is not a single extremely poor person in the county, and each person has an average of two to eight mu of land. The proportion of land ownership among various classes has undergone tremendous changes: large landlords account for 3.74 percent of the population and own 4.85 percent of the total land, with an average of 5.8 mu per person. Small and medium landlords and rich peasants account for 11.63 percent of the population and own 15.45 percent of the land, with an average of 5.9 mu per person. Middle peasants account for 44 percent of the population and own 47.85 percent of the land, with an average of 4.79 mu per person. Poor peasants account for 33.96 percent of the population and own 27.74 percent of the land, with an average of 3.02 mu per person. This not only shows that there are no extremely poor people, but also shows that the average land of rich peasants is still more than that of other classes, which has played a role in clearing the way for the development of capitalist management. As for the feudal landlords, not only was their economic rule broken, but their political rule was also destroyed. The emancipated farmers are managing political affairs in an orderly manner and have launched an unprecedented production and construction movement. In the river management alone, 36,552 farmers participated, managing the Niuwei River, dredging the Xiao Zhang River, and building eight new irrigation canals and twenty-five branch ditches, totaling 91,614 zhang in length. This not only eliminated and reduced the floods of past generations, but also turned more than 490 hectares of dry land into paddy fields. In villages far from the river, a well-digging campaign was launched. In Huang Gou village alone, 22 wells were dug, increasing paddy fields by 440 mu. Mutual assistance in production and labor for prosperity has become a new fashion. Women have also joined the production front, launching a large-scale textile movement on the one hand, and actively participating in agricultural and sideline occupations and other kinds of labor on the other hand, and the air is filled with joy everywhere. The songs of "Supporting the Communist Party and thanking Chairman Mao" can be heard everywhere.
　　【Report from Wei County, 1st】In order to realize "Land to the Tiller," cadres in Jize and other places have launched a land donation movement. Yang Zhixuan, Chairman of the Jize County Council (one of the three famous households in the county), donated 300 mu of fertile land, keeping only 70 mu to maintain his family's livelihood. Comrade Zhao Ke of the Jize County Committee of the Communist Party donated 30 mu of land. Another county committee member, Comrade Zhao Li, is also actively mobilizing his family to donate land. Comrade Han Guozhi, Secretary of the County Committee, is an out-of-town cadre and will soon return to his hometown to mobilize his family to donate land to the peasants. In addition to calling on all Party members from landlord backgrounds to donate land first, the county also encourages farmers who have been allocated land to work hard to increase production and become prosperous.
　　Furthermore, Comrade Liu Hao, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Third Prefectural Committee of Southern Hebei, has recently persuaded his family to donate more than 70 mu of land. Comrade Jin Kexiao, Principal of the Second Complete Primary School in Chengci, is a famous intellectual in Ci County. He was deeply moved when he heard the news of land donations in various places and persuaded his family to donate 100 mu of land, four houses, and ten shi of grain to the peasants at a mass meeting on August 21. The masses shouted, "Support enlightened industrialists and merchants! Industrialists and merchants are the most glorious!" The Border Participation Committee of the Southern Hebei Office, the Southern Hebei District Party Committee, and the Southern Hebei Administrative Office wrote letters separately to encourage and commend the above comrades for their righteous act of donating land.
　　【Report from Yangcheng, 2nd】When the troops of the 21st Sub-district of Taiyue were conducting education on speaking out grievances and emancipating themselves, they further enlightened the consciousness of the soldiers. Many cadres and soldiers from landlord backgrounds persuaded their families to donate land. Liu Zongyao, a soldier from the 3rd Company of the 4th Regiment, voluntarily persuaded his father to reduce interest three times. The first time he returned five shi of grain to the masses, the second time he returned fifteen shi of grain, and the third time he personally asked for leave to return home and voluntarily donated eighteen shi of grain and cattle and land to the village office. The villagers also took care of his family's life, leaving them a portion of grain and ten mu of land.

　　鸡泽认真执行政协决议
    初步实现耕者有其田
    互助生产劳动发家成新风尚
    【本报威县电】鸡泽解放后，八万农民在共产党领导下进行了轰轰烈烈的翻身斗争，把几千年来压在身上的封建统治与八年来的敌伪汉奸统治推翻，初步实现了孙中山及政协会议决定的耕者有其田。据全县调查，减租减息运动中，农民算回土地二一七一一亩。反奸霸斗争中，收回土地一二六三四亩。赎地运动中，得土地六三七一亩。前后共收回土地四○七一六亩。现在全县已没有一个赤贫，每人平均都有了二至八亩的土地。各阶层现在土地占有比例发生极大变化，计：大地主占人口百分之三点七四，占有土地总数的百分之四点八五，每人平均五点八亩。中小地主和富农占人口百分之十一点六三，占有土地百分之一五点四五，每人平均五点九亩。中农占人口百分之四四，占有土地百分之四七点八五，每人平均四点七九亩。贫农占人口百分之三三点九六，占有土地百分之二七点七四，每人平均三点○二亩，这里不仅说明没有了赤贫，而且可以看出富农平均土地仍较其他阶层为多，在发展资本主义经营上是起了扫清道路的作用。对于封建地主，则不仅打破了它的经济统治，而且摧毁了它的政治统治。翻身后的农民有秩序地治理着政事，并开展了前所未有的生产建设运动。仅治河一项，前后即有农民三六五五二人参加，治理了牛尾河，修浚了小漳河，新修了八条浇地河渠和二十五条支沟，共长九一六一四丈。不仅免除与减少了历代的水灾，而且把四百九十余顷旱地变成水田。在距河远的村庄，则开展了凿井运动。仅黄沟一村，便打了二十二眼，增加四四○亩水田。互助生产，劳动发家成了新的风尚。妇女也走上生产战线，一方面开展了大规模纺织运动，另方面也积极参加了农副业等各种劳作，到处充溢着愉悦的空气。“拥护共产党、感谢毛主席”的歌声，随地可闻。
    【本报威县一日电】为实现“耕者有其田”，鸡泽等地干部掀起献田运动。鸡泽县参议会议长杨直轩（为该县有名三大户之一）献出良田三百亩。家里仅留七十亩维持生活。中共鸡泽县委赵克同志献田三十亩。另一县委赵立同志，也在积极动员其家族献田。县委书记韩国治同志系外籍干部，也将于最近返里，动员其家庭献田给农民。该县除号召所有地主出身的党员要首先献田外，并鼓励分得土地的农民努力生产发家。
    又冀南三地委宣传部副部长刘浩同志，最近亦说服其家庭，献田七十余亩。成磁第二完小校长靳客孝同志，系磁县有名的知识分子。听到各地献田消息，深为感动，亦说服其家庭，于八月二十一日在群众大会上向农民献田一百亩，宅子四所，粮食十石。群众高呼：“拥护开明工属！工属最光荣！”对以上同志的献田义举，边参会冀南办事处，冀南区党委，冀南行署特分头写信鼓励表扬。
    【本报阳城二日讯】太岳二十一分区部队在进行诉苦翻身教育时，进一步启发了战士们的觉悟，许多地主出身的干部战士，纷纷说服自己的家庭献田，四团三连战士刘宗尧自动劝父退息三次，第一次给群众退粮五石，第二次退粮食十五石，第三次他又亲自请假回家，自动向村公所献出十八石粮食及耕牛田地，村里群众也照顾了他家的生活，给他家留下一部粮食及土地十亩。
