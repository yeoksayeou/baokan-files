　　[Reported by our newspaper from Weixian on the 19th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops are invading the Jilu Yu area on a large scale, and the flames of war are spreading. In order to defend the fruits of the War of Resistance and the people's emancipation interests, the Jinnan District Party Committee has called on the party, government, military, and people of the entire district to urgently mobilize and support the front line with practical actions to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and ensure the victory of the self-defense war: (1) All localities must conduct propaganda and education among the masses to make them understand that defeating feudal rule to obtain land is only the first step in emancipation, and smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive to protect the fruits of emancipation is complete emancipation. Call on young people to enthusiastically join the People's Liberation Army, creating a surge of enthusiasm where "wives send their husbands and mothers send their sons" to join the army, and propose that good cadres and good party members take the lead, leading the masses to collectively join the army. It is necessary to mobilize soldiers who have returned home privately or have not returned to the team after the deadline to return to the battlefield, ensuring a steady supply of soldiers to the front. Personnel from rear agencies and organizations should carry out production, and a campaign of frugality and thrift. Donate money and materials to support the front, ensuring war supplies. They must also work intensively to maximize work efficiency, launch enthusiastic comfort campaigns for soldiers at the front, conscientiously provide preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and pay attention to solving difficulties such as land and housing in mass movements. (2) Seize the gaps and fully assist the peasant emancipation movement. Cadres should boldly support the masses, so that farmers can be completely emancipated, so as to achieve land to the tiller. (3) Militia self-defense forces must be urgently mobilized to organize joint defense, strictly prevent sabotage by special agents, protect local security, and the border areas must implement scorched earth tactics. They must cooperate with the main forces in combat, penetrate deep into the rear of Chiang Kai-shek's army to cut off Chiang Kai-shek's supply lines, and universally carry out guerrilla warfare.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Weixian on the 20th] The military region's directly subordinate units held a general meeting of all soldiers on the 13th to conduct in-depth war mobilization. Deputy Political Commissar Liu called on everyone to enthusiastically launch a campaign to support the front, with good cadres leading new recruits to the front line, and all comrades in the rear working more intensively, with one person doing the work of two, and vigorously practicing frugality and thrift, launching a vigorous comfort campaign and donating money. From now on, each person will save one or two liang of rice per day to support the front. Deputy Political Commissar Liu immediately donated half a year's disability pension, and Political Commissar Wang and Deputy Commander Wang each donated 1,500 yuan. After the meeting, all units and individuals were brewing to support the front and donating money, materials, and writing letters of condolence.
