Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Shanghai report: The private shipping industry is facing a desperate situation due to the burden of military drafts and the oppression of "state-run" shipping. According to investigations: The Kuomintang's official China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had a total of 25 ships before the war, with a total tonnage of less than 50,000 tons. After the victory, it received enemy property of about 300,000 tons, plus 350,000 tons of Liberty ships and landing ships transferred by the United States, totaling more than 500 ships with a total tonnage of about 700,000 tons. The newly established Executive Yuan Water Transport Corps, with the help of the United States, will possess 170,000 to 250,000 tons of ships. The private-owned Min Sheng Company, which had more than 100 ships with 30,060 tons before the war, now has only 80 ships with less than 20,000 tons, a loss of four-ninths. The San Bei Company, which had more than 40 ships with a total of 33,000 tons before the war, now has only a dozen old ships with less than 8,000 tons, a loss of three-quarters. The Da Da Company and Da Tong Company had 20 ships before the war, but now have less than 10. Of the 21 ports originally opened on the Jiangbei line, only three remain. The loss of docks, warehouses, and godowns that were bombed or requisitioned is even more incalculable. These private shipping companies, which suffered huge losses, not only did not receive any enemy or transferred ships, but were also constantly subjected to military drafts. Ships berthed in ports are forcibly requisitioned, ships on the way are forcibly pulled away, and even ships under repair have officials inquiring about their departure dates. Large ships are all drafted, and even small tugboats of two or three hundred tons are forced to carry soldiers and ammunition day and night. The draft fees are not only settled every six months, but the amount is too low, and the fuel costs alone are far from sufficient. (It is said that two tons of fuel are required to transport one ton of cargo. The government-allocated coal costs 100,000 yuan per ton, while state-run shipping companies only need 20,000 yuan.) People in the private shipping industry said: "We sacrificed 300,000 tons of ships for the country during the war by closing the ports. Now the government is bestowing us with such cruel methods, which makes us feel deeply grieved and indignant."

　　军差拖累“国营”压迫下
    民营航业面临绝境
    【新华社延安四日电】沪讯：民营航业在军差拖累及“国营”航业压迫下，已面临绝境。据调查：国民党官办的招商局，战前船只共有二十五艘，总吨数不及五万吨；胜利后，接收敌产约三十万吨，加上由美国移交的自由轮及登陆舰三十五万吨，总计现在大小船只超过五百艘总吨数约七十万吨。新近成立的行总水运大队在美国帮助下，将拥有船只十七万至二十五万吨。而民营的民生公司，战前拥船百余艘计三万六十吨，现只剩八十艘不到二万吨，损失九分之四。三北公司战前拥船四十余艘共三万三千吨，现余旧轮十余艘不到八千吨，损失达四分之三。大达公司及大通公司的船只战前有二十艘，现不到十艘。原辟江北线二十一个口岸，现仅有三个，码头仓库栈房被炸被征，损失更不堪计算。这些损失巨大的民营航业，不但没有分得任何敌伪与移交的船只，且时时被拉军差。在埠停泊的要强征，在行驶途中的要强拉，甚至还在修理的船也有官员去查问出航日期。大船征光了，二三百吨的小火轮也被迫日以继夜地载运士兵和军火，差费不仅半年一结，且数目过低，单是燃料费就不敷甚巨。（按每运一吨货要用二吨燃料，政府配给的煤每吨要十万元，官办航业只要二万元。）民航业人士表示：“战争中为国家封港牺牲了三十万吨船只，如今政府以这样残忍的办法赐予我们，实使我们悲愤不已。”
