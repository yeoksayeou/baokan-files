(From Our Newspaper, Anyang, 22nd) The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Anyang constantly send small groups of special agents and armed forces to sneak into our liberated areas for night raids and harassment. On the night of the 12th, dozens of armed special agents raided Zhangjiadian in the Sixth District, but were discovered by our militia sentry post. The sentry opened fire, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits fled in disgrace. At midnight on the 14th, more than 30 armed special agents suddenly attacked our Xijiang Village. At that time, the masses in the village had just finished a meeting, and the militia was changing shifts. The enemy broke into the main street from the north of the village, wounding one of our militiamen and quickly occupied the intersection, setting up machine guns and blocking the entrance of our village command. Another group of enemies sneaked into the west courtyard of our headquarters, attempting to climb over the wall to annihilate our militia and village cadres. However, our militia had already climbed onto the roof before the enemy and fiercely bombarded them with grenades, driving them out of the courtyard. District cadre Comrade Wang Xiufeng commanded the militia to hold on, while personally leading three militiamen to break through the siege and ask for reinforcements. However, as soon as they crossed the southwest open courtyard, they were discovered by the enemy ambushing there. One person was wounded on the spot and two were captured. Comrade Wang Xiufeng took advantage of the enemy's capture to fire two shots with his pistol and dashed over the wall. The cadres and militia who remained in the headquarters, seeing that they could not break through, were determined to hold firm and wait for reinforcements. They completely blocked the entrances to the four neighboring houses with water tanks and boxes, and all went up to the roof. The enemy approached the house several times, but were repelled by grenades. They held on until the militia from nearby rushed to help, and the enemy began to flee. After an hour of fierce fighting, none of the cadres and militiamen in our headquarters were injured or killed. It is reported that many of the enemies who launched this raid were former fugitive special agents and landlords, and were aided by the traitor Zhang Quanfu (member of the self-defense force). The Anyang County Headquarters has issued a circular to commend the heroic and exemplary cadres and militia of the village, instructing all localities to immediately be vigilant, eliminate traitors, strengthen intelligence sentry posts, and quickly improve joint defense.

    民兵英勇反击获胜
    县指挥部通令表扬
    【本报安阳二十二日讯】安阳蒋伪军不断以小股特务武装潜入我解放区夜袭骚扰。十二日夜，特务武装数十人奔袭六区张贾店，被我民兵岗哨发觉，开枪射击，蒋伪狼狈窜去。十四日夜半又以特务武装三十余人突袭我西蒋村，是时该村群众开会刚散，民兵正在换哨，敌人即从村北突进大街，击伤我民兵一人，迅速占据十字街口，架起机枪，封锁我村指挥部门口。另一股敌人，即摸进我指挥部西院，企图越墙聚歼我民兵及村干部。但我民兵已先敌上房，以手榴弹猛炸，将其骗逐出院，区干部王秀峰同志一面指挥民兵坚持，一面亲率民兵三人突围请援。但刚越过西南空院，即被预伏该处之敌发现，当场有一人负伤两人被俘，王秀峰同志乘敌捉人之际，以盒子枪连发两枪，越墙冲出。留在指挥部之干部及民兵见无法突围，遂决心固守待援，并用水缸及箱柜将通四邻之门口完全堵塞，全部上房，敌人数次接近房下，均被手榴弹击退。一直坚持到附近驰援民兵赶到，敌人始回头逃窜，前后激战一小时，我指挥部全体干部民兵无一伤亡。据悉，此次奔袭之敌，不少是过去之逃亡特务地主，并有内奸张全福（自卫队员）配合。安阳县指挥部特通令表扬该村英勇模范的干部与民兵。指示各地立即警觉起来，清除内奸，加强情报岗哨，迅速健全联防。
