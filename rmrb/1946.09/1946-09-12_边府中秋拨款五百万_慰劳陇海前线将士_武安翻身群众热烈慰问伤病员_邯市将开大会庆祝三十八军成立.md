　　The Border Region Government Allots Five Million to Comfort Soldiers on the Longhai Front
    Wu'an's Emancipated Masses Warmly Console the Wounded and Sick
    Handan to Hold Grand Meeting to Celebrate the Founding of the 38th Army
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 9th Dispatch] As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government has specially allocated five million yuan to comfort all the soldiers engaged in the self-defense war on the Longhai Front.
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 9th Dispatch] This afternoon, representatives from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, the Central Bureau, the Political Department, the Handan Municipal Government, and other organizations held a meeting at the military region's reception office. It was specifically decided that on the 13th of this month, a "Border Region People's Rally to Support the Founding of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army and Celebrate the Great Victory of the Frontline Self-Defense" will be held in Handan City. A large-scale troop support movement will also be launched, with Mayor Wang Yuechen and Minister Ren Baige serving as directors of the preparatory committee. The preparatory work is currently underway.
    [Our Dispatch] On the 10th of this month, the people of Wu'an City happily and excitedly celebrated their first Mid-Autumn Festival after emancipation. Fifteen streets throughout the city held emancipation recollection symposiums in fifteen different locations. The cry of "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party" resounded throughout the city. More than 210 emancipated citizens of Shagou Street even contributed a portion of the fruits they had fought for and shared a unity meal. Twenty Yangko teams performed various stories on the streets and lanes, fully demonstrating the joy of "the masses emancipating themselves and singing and enjoying themselves." An emancipated citizen named Zhang De, slightly tipsy, said at the emancipation meeting: "In the old society, we were oppressed and couldn't hold our heads up. Last year, the Eighth Route Army liberated Wu'an City and gave me 100 yuan for the Mid-Autumn Festival to buy some vegetables. This year, after emancipation, I ate pork in the morning, mutton at noon, and even drank wine. I thank Chairman Mao." The citizens wrote more than 2,000 letters of condolence to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the frontline self-defense soldiers, especially many to the 19th Regiment of the Wu'an Regiment - Unit ×. Wives and mothers told in their letters about how they were being treated with preferential treatment, encouraging their husbands and sons to teach the invaders a good lesson. Piles of gifts were sent to the hospital, and even tonight, people are still coming to give gifts in an endless stream.
