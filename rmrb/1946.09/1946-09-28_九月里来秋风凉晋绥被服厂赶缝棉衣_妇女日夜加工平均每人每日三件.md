　　九月里来秋风凉晋绥被服厂赶缝棉衣
　　妇女日夜加工平均每人每日三件
    【新华社兴县二十五日电】“九月里来秋风凉，赶做棉衣送前方。”晋绥被服厂职工和农村中许多妇女，一面唱着歌，一面日夜为前线将士赶做棉衣，军区后勤部被服厂缝纫组女工杨工玉带病做工，五天内产量超过前一周产量百分之二十七。临县市由二十岁至五十多岁的妇女都卷入缝棉衣热潮里。每人每天缝制三件，她们说：“我愿不睡觉，为前方军队做棉衣，不打垮反动派，日子永远不得平安。”兴县一区妇女五天内做好棉衣五千余套，李家坫村白绍花家四个女人连夜赶缝二十四套。奥家湾五十多岁的老太婆日夜不知疲倦地缝制，且缝的最精致，宁武张初元村三百多妇女数天内就缝好三千套棉衣送往前线。
