　　A Visit with General Kong Congzhou
    Ze Ran

    Of medium build, with the bearing of a soldier, his hair already graying, but with the vitality of a young man on his face. He speaks with a heavy Shaanxi accent. When talking about the past, he sometimes falls silent, revealing much contemplation. When talking about the uprising, he is radiant, expressing his opposition to the civil war and dictatorship, with a very deep determination. This is the reporter's first impression of Division Commander Kong Congzhou, of the Gong County Uprising.

    His contemplations must be considerable.

    In the army for more than twenty years, from being a recruit to becoming a division commander, from fighting the Northern Warlords to fighting Japanese imperialism, the life-and-death experiences on the battlefield are enough for a soldier to go through. Yet the persecution by the dictator increased daily, constantly following him, following this troop with a revolutionary tradition from the Northwest. For the sake of resisting Japan, he participated in the Xi'an Incident, the first effort to oppose the civil war and insist on unity against Japan. Nine years later, he had to use an uprising to oppose the civil war again. Although he has the "lengwa" (unafraid of hardship) character that people from Shaanxi speak of, he cannot help but feel some emotion when mentioning the past. When mentioning the perfidy of the Kuomintang dictatorial group, and its anti-democratic, anti-people crimes, he cannot help but feel the greatest resentment.

    I. Hero of Military Admonition

    In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, General Kong Congzhou served as the Brigade Commander of the Independent 46th Brigade. This unit was the foundation of the Jingguo Army from the early Republic of China, which was founded by Mr. Yu Youren during the revolution in the Northwest. In 1926, in order to ensure the smooth northward advance of the Northern Expeditionary Army, he and his troops held Xi'an for eight months. They were surrounded by 100,000 troops of the Northern Warlords Wu Peifu and Liu Zhenhua. When the food in the city ran out, they ate grass roots and oil dregs, and finally defended this ancient city. They then took advantage of the victory to participate in the Northern Expedition, advanced into Longhai, and defeated the direct-line-Lu warlord allied forces at Dangshan Chengdazhuang, and joined forces with the southern Northern Expeditionary Army in Xuzhou. Today, there is still an Oil Dreg Pavilion in the stadium on North Avenue in Xi'an, which commemorates this arduous battle.

    The victory won by eating oil dregs was quickly ruined by Chiang Kai-shek. The Northern Expedition in which the Northwest Army participated was not yet completed when Chiang Kai-shek's order for a civil war transferred him to the Hanzhong area to confront the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which had been fighting alongside them. The Northwest Army reluctantly obeyed the order, resulting in the loss of many men and horses. Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, Hu Zongnan's First Division, suffered no damage and easily seized the territory of the Northwest Army. From then on, southern Shaanxi became Chiang's army's territory. At this time, the Northwest Army and the Northeast Army simultaneously received Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to "monitor" each other. On one hand, the country was in deep crisis, and brothers were fighting each other. Chiang Kai-shek was "suppressing communists" and also massacring anyone with patriotic enthusiasm who held different opinions. On the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party called for an end to the civil war and unity against Japan. The Northwest Army had patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary traditions. At that time, Brigade Commander Kong Congzhou (then he was the commander of Yang Hucheng's Guards Second Brigade, responsible for the defense of Xi'an) and General Yang Hucheng chose the latter path, which was the famous "December 12th Military Admonition." Commander Kong was directly involved in commanding troops, suppressing the special agent military police Third Regiment, and killing Jiang Xiaoxian, who was cheered by the people. He contributed to the launch of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan.

    The merit praised by the people was precisely the greatest hatred of the dictator. The history of the 46th Brigade afterwards fully illustrates this point.

    II. Loyal Subject of the War of Resistance

    In the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy invaded and occupied southern Shanxi, and the Ushijima Division was attempting to cross the Fengling to the south and enter the Central Plains. At this time, a unit came from across the Yongji city. The Battle of Yongji lasted for eight days and nights, preventing the Ushijima Division from crossing the Yellow River. This unit was the Independent 46th Brigade, reorganized from the Second Guards Brigade. The soldiers of the entire brigade joyfully sang a majestic war song:

    "We are the glorious revolutionary armed forces,
    We will strive for the victory of national liberation!
    If we don't kill the invading robbers, we will surely die at the hands of the robbers!
    ……………”

    Sadly, they did not die at the hands of the Japanese robbers. Although Chiang Kai-shek had planned to treat all dissenting troops this way, when Chiang Kai-shek saw that the Japanese robbers could not eliminate this unit, he took matters into his own hands.

    After the bloody battle of Yongji, the 46th Brigade and the 17th Division joined forces in the Pinglu area of southern Shanxi, under the command of Zhao Shoushan, commander of the 38th Army.

    Pinglu is located south of the Yellow River and north of the Zhongtiao Mountains. The mountain range stretches long from east to west and narrow from north to south, gradually sloping down to the river bank with little room to maneuver. In addition, friendly forces did not cooperate, and the enemy often looked down from above, forcing the 38th Army step by step into the Yellow River. Guarding the opposite bank of the Yellow River were Chiang Kai-shek's direct-line troops. The enemy attacked from the mountains, and they attacked from the south bank to the north bank. The boats carrying wounded soldiers who shed blood for the country were also overturned by them. They could not get a single reinforcement, nor could they send over an injured colorful flag (at that time, the military station hospitals were all on the south bank of the Yellow River). The 38th Army (including the 46th Brigade) stayed in such a place for three years, fighting bloody battles with the enemy for three years, with more than two hundred large and small battles. The most intense was the "June 6th Battle" in 1939. The enemy concentrated the strength of two and a half divisions of the 20th and 35th Divisions, intending to drive the 38th Army into the Yellow River from north to south in one breath. The 46th Brigade retreated to the river bank, and the guns and cannons across the river bombarded them again. The soldiers fighting with their backs to the water cried out, "We were not killed by the enemy but by the 24th Division (Hu Zongnan's unit)!" At that time, those crying soldiers were around Commander Kong. He did not cry. He resolutely led the entire brigade to charge behind the enemy. This force of desperate soldiers rushed into the enemy's artillery position in Fengcun, Pinglu, destroyed six enemy cannons, and annihilated an enemy infantry company. The "June 6th Battle" was thus successfully concluded.

    During these years, Chiang Kai-shek only supplemented the 46th Brigade with fifty broken guns. The most "supplemented" were the central political workers who sowed discord between the military and the people and between officers and soldiers. Not supplementing guns, not supplementing people, but still failing to bring down this unit, the 38th Army became stronger and stronger. The Chongqing newspapers praised them as the "iron pillar supporting the War of Resistance in the Zhongtiao Mountains." Chiang Kai-shek ultimately personally removed this iron pillar that the enemy could not pull out.

    III. Insulted and Injured

    The "December Coup" made most officers and soldiers of the 38th Army feel a danger, which was that the situation of the War of Resistance was becoming increasingly difficult. In the previous battles, they realized that to fight well, they must have the help of the common people. At that time, the members of the Shanxi Sacrifice League were a powerful assistant in mobilizing the masses to help the army. The "December Coup" destroyed this assistant. Thinking about the future battles, many people felt sad. Just at this time, an unexpected event occurred. Chiang Kai-shek issued a military order transferring the 38th Army to Henan for rest and reorganization. This iron pillar that had supported the War of Resistance in Zhongtiao and had connections with the local people was pulled out. This was in October 1940. At that time, people with insight had already begun to see the signs of the collapse of Chiang's army of 200,000 in the Zhongtiao Mountains in May 1941.

    When the 38th Army crossed the Yellow River, the 46th Brigade had been reorganized into the 35th Division. Commander Kong led this unit to guard the Guangwu Mangshan head position for two years. Chiang Kai-shek, unable to eliminate this unit, devised other ways to corrupt and eliminate it himself. He transferred the elite corps of the 38th Army that could fight and charge to the Yellow River ferry crossing. At that time, smuggling was rampant at the Yellow River ferry crossing, and the headquarters was the base camp for smuggling. Under the lure of money, few officers and soldiers guarding the crossing did not engage in smuggling and corruption. The soldiers of the 38th Army, eager to kill the enemy, became corrupt in such a life.

    For those who could not be corrupted, Chiang Kai-shek ordered them to be transferred to concentration camps, including the most meritorious people of the 38th Army during the War of Resistance, from regimental commanders to soldiers. Zhao Shoushan, commander of the army, and Kong Congzhou, commander of the division, had pleaded for them, expressed their feelings, hesitated, and sighed, wondering how to keep these brothers who had fought bloody battles for the country and the nation for several years from going to that living hell. This worry turned his hair white.

    The years of guarding the river defense passed like this.

    During the Central Plains Campaign, the 35th Division and the 17th Division defended Shanxiaoguan Wuzhiling side by side, fighting the enemy for four days and nights. In the Yu-Xi Campaign, Commander Kong led the 55th Division (reorganized from the 35th Division) in a bloody battle with the enemy in Changshui for two months. However, Chiang Kai-shek's direct-line, Tang Enbo's army of 200,000 lost eight cities in ten days, running far away before the enemy even appeared. Everyone thought it was a gratifying thing that Commander Kong, who had been persecuted, could achieve such a record, but the dictator would not allow the people to have this joy. Commander Kong's mood became even heavier when he talked about this. He said sarcastically, "They also adopted a method of 'the temple is there, but the god is not' to eliminate the miscellaneous troops." The 38th Army suffered considerable losses in the Central Plains and Yu-Xi campaigns. According to the usual practice, it should be quickly replenished, but Chiang Kai-shek's only "supplement" to the miscellaneous troops was to merge them. The 96th Army and the 38th Army were merged into one army. The remaining number of the 96th Army still existed, but after being replenished, it became Chiang's army.

    The "god" of the 38th Army was not completely eliminated. Therefore, last spring, Chiang Kai-shek transferred Sun Weiru, commander-in-chief of the Northwest Army's Fourth Group Army, to the Sixth War Zone, and Zhao Shoushan, commander of the 38th Army, to Gansu, to separate them from their troops. The vacancy was filled by Zhang Yaoming, a loyal pawn of Chiang Kai-shek who was reviled as a "Shaanxi traitor." From then on, from division commander to regimental and battalion commanders, the 38th Army was transferred away in large numbers under the pretext of training and dismissal, and all vacancies were filled by officers from the Central Military Academy. Chiang Kai-shek stipulated that anyone who came from the ranks, even a squad leader, could not be employed. Commander Kong said, "As a result of this 'stealing beams and changing pillars, luring the tiger away from the mountain,' there were fewer and fewer old Northwest Army people and those troops loyal to the War of Resistance." He made a calculation: In 1939, the Northwest Army's Fourth Group Army had two armies (38th and 96th) and fourteen regiments. In 1945, the Fourth Group Army headquarters was transferred, and the two armies were merged into one army, with a total of nine regiments. In 1946, after another reorganization, the army was changed to a division, leaving only six regiments.

    In March of this year, Chiang Kai-shek secretly ordered Hu Zongnan to change Commander Kong's 55th Division into the 55th Brigade, and transfer Kong to the 38th Army as deputy commander. After he left his original unit, he immediately transferred the 55th Division to the front line of Xinxiang to participate in the civil war. On one hand, he ordered him to eliminate himself, and on the other hand, he ordered Hu Zongnan to "find an opportunity to disarm and eliminate" them, and finally completely eliminate this meritorious force that had fought in the War of Resistance for eight years. Commander Kong could not bear to see this Northwest People's Armed Forces completely eliminated by Chiang Kai-shek, so on the afternoon of May 15th, he escaped the surveillance of the special agents, returned to the 55th Division and convened an emergency meeting. All officers and soldiers of the division then announced the anti-civil war uprising in Gong County.

    IV. Impressions of Coming to the Liberated Area

    The heavy mood passed. When the reporter asked about his impressions of coming to the Liberated Area, Commander Kong said with a smile: "The faces of the common people impressed me the most. Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and civil war have made tens of millions of people in Henan look sallow and emaciated. The first thing I saw when I stepped into the Liberated Area were the faces of those smiling, rosy-cheeked people. These people were courageously carrying stretchers and holding guns to the front line of self-defense. At that time, the Longhai self-defense counterattack was underway." He said, "With so many people actively participating in the front line of self-defense in order to eat their fill and live well, victory is certainly not to be questioned."

    In the various agencies in Handan, he saw a new atmosphere. Every working comrade dedicated all their energy to the intense work, and they felt unparalleled joy in "serving the people."

    Before Commander Kong met General Liu Bocheng, in his imagination, General Liu must be a brave and burly person. After meeting Commander Liu, he said: General Liu is a sincere, loyal, and amiable elder.

    What moved him the most were the various letters of condolences written to him by old friends and soldiers of the 17th Division. The letters said: In the past, we could not read and write, but now we have learned to read and write.

    Commander Kong, who had been exhausted for more than two months from charging, breaking through, and encircling, completely forgot his fatigue in such a novel life. Now, every morning he gets up early, takes a short walk, and then immerses himself in Mao Zedong's works, the People's Daily, and various books and magazines published in the Liberated Area. He said, "I haven't had a good read for several years. In the past, I could get some books that told the truth from Chongqing, but in the past two years, I couldn't see anything."

　　孔从周将军访问记
    泽然
    中等身材，军人气概，头发已经斑白了，脸上却有青年人的朝气，说话带着浓重的陕西口音，谈到过去他有时沉默，看得出有很多感慨，谈到起义他又洋溢着光辉，表示出他反对内战，反对独裁，有很深的决心。这就是巩县起义的孔从周师长给记者的第一次印象。
    他的感慨应该是不少的。
    在军队里二十多年，从当学兵到当师长，从打北洋军阀到打日本帝国主义，战场上的出生入死，已经够一个军人去经历了；独裁者的迫害却那样与日俱增的时时追随着他，追随着这支有着西北革命传统的队伍。为了抗战，他曾经参加过第一次反对内战坚持抗日团结的西安事变，九年以后，他又不得不用起义来反对内战了。虽然他有陕西人说的“冷娃”（不怕硬）那种性格，但提到旧事，他却不能不有些感慨，提到国民党独裁集团的反复无常，不民主反人民的罪恶，他更不能不有最大的愤恨了。
    一、兵谏英雄
    孔从周将军在抗战初期，任独立四十六旅的旅长，这支队伍是民初靖国军的底子，那是于佑任先生在西北闹革命时创办的。民国十五年为了使北伐军顺利北上，他同他的队伍在西安坚守了八个月，围着他们的是北洋军阀吴佩孚、刘镇华的十万大军，城内粮食吃完了，便吃草根吃油渣，终于坚守了这座古城，最后把北洋军阀的部队打败了，并乘胜参加北伐，挺进陇海，击溃直鲁军阀联军于砀山程大庄，与南上北伐军会师徐州。现在西安北大街体育场，还有一座油渣亭，就是纪念这一次艰苦战役的。
    吃油渣换来的胜利很快就被蒋介石糟踏了，西北军参加的北伐还没有彻底完成，蒋介石内战的命令又把他调到汉中地区，同过去一道革命的队伍——中国工农红军对垒起来。西北军当时悲愤的服从了命令，结果损失了好些人马，蒋介石嫡系胡宗南的第一师没有受到丝毫损伤，却轻巧的窃据了西北军的地盘。从此，陕南便成了蒋军的天下。这时，西北军东北军更同时接到蒋介石彼此“监视”的密令，一面国难深重，弟兄＠墙，蒋介石在“剿共”也在屠杀每个稍有爱国热情的异己者；一面是中国共产党的号召停止内战，团结抗日。西北军是有爱国热情和革命传统的，当时的孔从周旅长（那时他任杨虎城将军警备第二旅旅长，担任西安的城防）。在这两条道路的当中，他和杨虎城将军一道选择了后面的一条，这就是有名的“双十二兵谏”。孔师长那时是参与指挥部队，扑灭特务宪兵第三团，打死人心称快的蒋孝先的直接行动的人，以后中国抗日战争能够发动，他是有功劳的。
    为人民所称赞的功劳，正是独裁者统治者最大的憎恨，四十六旅以后的历史充分说明了这一点。
    二、抗战忠臣
    抗战第二年，敌人侵陷了晋南，牛岛师团正企图南渡风陵，直入中原，这时，一支队伍从他对面开来永济城，永济一役就打了八天八夜，打得牛岛师团没有渡过黄河，这支队伍就是由警备二旅改编的独立四十六旅。全旅的战士们愉快的唱着雄壮的战歌：
    “我们是光荣的革命武力，
    我们要争取民族解放的胜利！
    我们不杀侵略强盗，定会死在强盗手里！
    ……………”
    可叹的是：他们并没有死在日本强盗手里，虽然蒋介石对待一切异己部队，都曾作过这样的打算，但是当蒋介石看到日本强盗不能消灭这支队伍时，它便自己来亲自动手了。
    永济血战之后，四十六旅与十七师会师于晋南平陆一带，归三十八军赵寿山军长指挥。
    平陆这地方，南面黄河，北靠中条，山势东西漫长，南北狭窄，慢慢倾斜直到河岸，很少周旋余地，加之友军不与配合，敌人便常常居高临下，把三十八军步步逼进黄河。黄河对面守卫的是蒋介石嫡系部队，敌人从山上往下打，他们从南岸往北岸打，为国流血的伤兵船，也被他们打翻了，得不到一个援兵，送不过一个受伤的彩号（当时兵站医院都在黄河南岸），三十八军（四十六旅在内）就一直在这样一个地方，守了三年，与敌血战了三年，大小作战二百余次，最激烈一次是二十八年的“六六战役”，敌人集中二十、三十五两个半师团的兵力，打算由北朝南，把三十八军一股气赶到黄河里，四十六旅退到河岸上，隔河的枪炮又轰击过来了，背水作战的战士却痛哭起来，“没有被敌人打死反被廿四师（胡宗南部）打死了”！当时，那些痛哭的士兵正在孔师长周围，他没有哭，他坚决领导全旅，往敌人后面冲，这一支哀兵，冲到平陆丰村敌人炮兵阵地里，摧毁了敌人六门大炮，歼灭了敌人一个步兵中队，“六六战役”，从此才胜利结束。
    在这几年中间蒋介石只补充了四十六旅五十支破枪，“补充”最多的却是那些离间军民关系、官兵关系的中央政工人员。不补充枪，不补充人，却没有把这支部队搞垮，三十八军却越打越强，重庆的报纸赞扬他们是“支持中条山抗战的铁柱”。这条敌人拔不去的铁柱，最后蒋介石又亲手来拔了。
    三、被侮辱与损害
    “十二月政变”，三十八军的大多数官兵感到了一个危险，便是抗战的局面越来越艰苦了，他们在历次作战中体会到，要仗打得好，一定要有老百姓帮忙，当时，晋南的牺盟会人员，正是动员群众帮助军队的一个有力助手，“十二月政变”把这个助手毁掉了，想到未来的作战，许多人感到悲伤。就在这时，一个没有预料到的事件降临了。蒋介石下了一道军令，调三十八军到河南休整，这支同当地群众有联系的支持中条抗战的铁柱便被拔掉了。这是二十九年十月的事情。当时，一般有眼光的人已经开始看到，三十年五月中条山蒋军二十万人溃退的征候了。
    三十八军调过黄河时，四十六旅已改编为三十五师，孔师长率领着这支队伍守卫广武邙山头阵地达两年之久。敌人消灭不了的这支队伍，蒋介石却想了另外的花样，使他自己腐蚀消灭，他把三十八军能打能冲的精锐兵团都调到黄河渡口上去。那时黄河渡口盛行着走私，长官部便是走私的大本营，守渡的官兵在金钱的引诱下很少不走私腐化的，渴望杀敌的三十八军士兵，便在这样的生活里自行腐化下来。
    腐蚀不了的人，蒋介石就下令调进集中营，抗战中三十八军最有功劳的人，上至团长，下至士兵都包括在内，赵寿山军长，孔从周师长，当时曾为这事请过客，说过情，也踌躇过，叹息过，怎样才能使这些为国家为民族血战了几年的弟兄，不到那人间地狱里去。这种忧愁便折磨白了他的头发。
    驻守河防的岁月，就这样的过去了。
    中原战役时，三十五师与十七师并肩防守山小关五支岭，同敌人打了四昼夜，豫西战役孔师长带领五十五师（三十五师改编）在长水同敌血战两月，而蒋介石嫡系的汤恩伯二十万大军，却在十天之内丢掉了八城，敌人的影子还没有到，他们就跑远了，备受迫害的孔师长能有这样的战绩，谁都认为是可喜的事情，但独裁者是不让人民有这点喜悦的。孔师长谈到这里时，他的心情更加沉重了，他用讽刺的口气说：“他们还采取一种庙在神不在的办法，来消灭杂牌。”三十八军在中原豫西等战役中损失是不小的，照例应该迅速补充，但是蒋介石对杂牌“补充的唯一办法就是合并。九十六军与三十八军从此就合并成了一个军，剩下的九十六军的番号仍然存在，但经补充后就成了蒋家的部队了。”
    三十八军的“神”并没有完全被消灭，因此去年春天，蒋介石又把西北军四集团军总司令孙蔚如调去六战区，三十八军军长赵寿山调去甘肃，使其离开自己的部队。遗缺却委来被骂为“陕奸”的蒋介石忠实爪牙张耀明担任，从此，三十八军从师长到团营长便在调训、撤职的名义下，大批调走，遗缺全部由中央军校军官来补任。凡是行伍出身的，那怕是班长蒋介石都规定一律不能任用，孔师长说：“这样‘偷梁换柱，调虎离山’的结果，西北军旧人，那些忠于抗战的部队便越来越少了”。他作了一个计算：在民国二十八年，西北军四集团军共辖两个军（三八、九六）十四个团，三十四年四集团军总部调走，两军合并为一个军，共九个团。三十五年，再一次整编，军改为师，就只剩下六个团了。
    今年三月，蒋介石又密令胡宗南把孔师长所属五十五师改为五十五旅，把孔调三十八军当副军长，等他脱离原部后，即把五十五师调赴新乡前线参加打内战。一面叫他自行消灭，一面还叫胡宗南“相机缴械消灭之”，最后完全消灭这抗战八年的有功队伍。孔师长不忍这支西北人民武装完全被蒋介石消灭，便在五月十五日下午，逃脱特务的监视，回到五十五师召开紧急会议，全师官兵遂于巩县城宣布了反内战起义。
    四、来解放区印象
    沉重的心情过去了，当记者问到来解放区的印象时，孔师长笑着说：“老百姓的脸色，给我印象最深。蒋介石的独裁内战已使河南几千万人民面黄肌瘦。踏进解放区第一眼看见的便是那些笑口常开，面色红润的老百姓的脸色。这些人正勇气蓬勃的抬着担架，拿着枪走上自卫前线，那时陇海自卫反击战正在开展。”他说：“为着自己吃得饱，生活得好，有这样多人踊跃参加自卫前线，那么胜利是一定不用讲的。”
    在邯市各机关，他看到一种新的风气，每个工作同志，都把自己的全部精力贡献于紧张的工作，他们却以“为人民服务”而感到无上的愉快。
    孔师长没有见过刘伯承将军之前，在他的想像里，刘将军一定是勇猛魁梧的人，同刘司令见面后，他说：刘将军是待人诚恳、忠诚、和蔼的长者。
    使他最感动的，是十七师的旧友和士兵写给他的各种慰问信，信上说：过去不能念书识字，现在我们已学会念书识字了。
    冲锋突围，疲劳了两个多月的孔师长，在如此新颖的生活里，他把疲劳完全忘记了。现在他每天一早起床略事散步后，即埋头在毛泽东著作、人民日报、解放区出版的各种书籍杂志里，他说：“几年没有好好看书了，过去还能从重庆得一些说真话的书看，这一二年，什么也看不到了。”
