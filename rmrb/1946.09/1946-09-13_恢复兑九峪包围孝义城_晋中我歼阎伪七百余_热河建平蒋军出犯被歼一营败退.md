Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 10th. Lvliang News: The Eighth Route Army in central Shanxi launched a self-defense counterattack against Yan's puppet troops west of Xiaoyi, and on the 3rd, recovered 15 strongholds, including Dui Jiuyu, Sima Town, and other strongholds along the important town and coal mining area of the Xi(xian) - Xiao(yi) road, 45 li southwest of Xiaoyi City. Yan's puppet troops in Dui Jiuyu, besieged by the Eighth Route Army from the east, south, and north, retreated to the large bunker and resisted stubbornly, but were completely annihilated. Xiong Feng, Yan's puppet troops entrenched in Sima Town and Nan Shangbao (more than ten li northeast of Xiaoyi), scurried back to Xiaoyi City. In this battle, more than 700 Yan's puppet troops were killed, wounded, or captured, and 19 light machine guns and more than 200 rifles were seized. On the 1st and 2nd, the Eighth Route Army had cleared more than ten strongholds of Yan's puppet troops within 20 li around Dui Jiuyu, including Shangbao and Gaotangkou. Xiaoyi City is now surrounded by the Eighth Route Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Rehe, 9th. A unit of the 22nd Division of the 93rd Army of the Kuomintang army, which occupied Jianping in central Rehe, launched an attack on the Eighth Route Army positions south of the city on the 4th. After fierce fighting, the invading army, one full battalion, was completely annihilated, and the remaining troops fled back to the city in defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. As predicted in the weekly comprehensive war report of this agency: After the Eighth Route Army on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front annihilated the Chiang army's Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army) and captured Zhao Xitian, the division commander (formerly the army commander), they annihilated three brigades (formerly divisions) of the 41st and 47th Divisions (originally both armies). One of the two giant pincers of the Chiang army attacking the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area, the western one, has been broken, and the other pincer coming from the east is being powerfully struck by the local army and people. In the eastern Henan area along the Longhai Railway, the Eighth Route Army recovered Taikang and Huaiyang on the 2nd, annihilating three regiments of the Chiang army. In central Shanxi, the Eighth Route Army recovered 15 strongholds including Dui Jiuyu on the Xi-Xiao highway. Xiaoyi City, an important strategic point on the plains of central Shanxi, has been surrounded by layers of Eighth Route Army and militia.

In Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning, the Eighth Route Army is constantly eliminating the enemy's effective strength everywhere. The Chiang army invading Jianping was wiped out one battalion. Chiang's army invading Xianghe suffered 1,300 casualties. Two companies of Chiang's army that attacked from Fengrun were completely wiped out at Qiliuzhuang. More than 1,000 Chiang's puppet troops attacked Niangniang Temple in Cangxian, and under the resistance of the local army and people, the Chiang's puppet troops suffered more than 60 casualties and fled in panic. This is the true picture of the "victory in sweeping Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning" as promoted by the Chiang side.

On all fronts, the Eighth Route Army took advantage of the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, when Chiang's officers and soldiers were homesick, to carry out calls, which were quite effective. Many Yan army soldiers in Qixian and other places in the central section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway in Shanxi deserted. The Shandong Military Region released more than 1,000 Chiang army prisoners of war and ordered them to go home for the festival. They had received treatment and care from the Eighth Route Army and were reluctant to leave, gazing at the Eighth Route Army armbands with nostalgia. A Chiang's riot plot was uncovered in Harbin. Jiang Pengfei, the well-known puppet army leader and commander of the New 277th Army dispatched by Chiang, and Li Mingxin, the military member of the Northeast Four Provinces Branch of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee's Enemy Rear Work Committee, and other riot organizers have all been arrested. This is a serious blow to Chiang's plan to attack Harbin, and its importance is no less than the victory on the self-defense front.

　　恢复兑九峪包围孝义城
    晋中我歼阎伪七百余
    热河建平蒋军出犯被歼一营败退
    【新华社兴县十日电】吕梁讯：晋中八路军向孝义西之阎伪军举行自卫反击，三日恢复孝义城西南四十五里隰（县）孝（义）路重镇及煤矿区兑九峪、司马镇等据点十五处。兑九峪阎伪军在八路军东南北三面围攻下，退据大碉堡顽抗，被全部歼灭。盘据司马镇、南上堡（孝义东北十余里）阎伪熊风窜回孝义城。此役毙伤俘阎伪军七百余人，缴轻机枪十九挺，步机二百余支。八路军已于一、二两日扫除兑九峪周围二十里内之上堡、高唐口等十余个阎伪军据点，刻孝义城已在八路军包围中。
    【新华社热河九日电】侵占热中建平之国民党军九十三军二十二师一部，四日向城南八路军阵地进犯，经激烈战斗后，进犯军一营全部被歼，余部败逃回城。
    【新华社延安十日电】正如本社一周综合战报所预料：冀鲁豫前线八路军在歼灭蒋军第三师（原第十军），活捉师长（原军长）赵锡田之后，复歼灭四十一师与四十七师（原来都是军）之三个旅（原师），蒋军进攻冀鲁豫解放区的两个巨钳，其西面一个已遭折断，另一个从东面来的钳子，正遭当地军民的有力打击。在陇海路豫东地区，八路军于二日收复太康、淮阳，歼灭蒋军三个团。在晋中八路军收复了隰孝公路上之兑九峪等十五据点，晋中平川重要战略点孝义城，已陷入八路军与民兵的层层包围。
    在冀热辽，八路军在各处不断消灭蒋军有生力量。进犯建平之蒋军，被消灭一个营。犯香河蒋军，死伤千三百人。自丰润出犯之蒋军两个连，在七柳庄全部复灭。沧县蒋伪军千余人犯娘娘庙，于当地军民抗击下蒋伪军死伤六十余人，狼狈逃窜。这就是蒋方所宣传的“扫荡冀热辽获得胜利”的事实真相。
    在各线上，八路军曾乘中秋将届，蒋军官兵思乡之际，进行喊话，颇有成效。山西同蒲路中段祈县等地阎军士兵，逃亡者不少。山东军区释放蒋军俘虏千余人令其回家过节，他们曾受八路军的治疗救护，临行时凝视八路军臂章恋恋不舍。哈尔滨破获蒋方暴动阴谋，蒋所派遣的著名伪军头子新二七七军军长姜鹏飞，及国民党中央执行委员会敌后工作委员会东北四省分会军事委员李明信等暴动组织，人员均已就擒，此乃系蒋方进攻哈市计划的严重打击，其重要性不下于自卫前线上的胜利。
