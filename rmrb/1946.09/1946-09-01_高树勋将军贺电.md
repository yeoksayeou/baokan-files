　　To the Handan Xinhua Broadcasting Station:
    I was overjoyed to hear of the establishment of your station. At this moment, when the Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on foreign forces, are stubbornly pursuing dictatorship and expanding the civil war, and the nation and the people are facing an unprecedentedly serious crisis, I deeply believe that your station will be able to represent the will of the people, voice righteous appeals, report accurate news, and shatter the lies of the reactionaries, in order to encourage and lead the people of the whole country to fight the reactionaries to the end, and to strive for the complete victory of the cause of independence, peace, and democracy. I hereby send a telegram to express my congratulations!
    Gao Shuxun, no seal
