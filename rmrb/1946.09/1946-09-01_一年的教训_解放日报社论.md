A Year of Lessons
*Liberation Daily* Editorial

A year has passed since August 28th of last year, when Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and his party flew to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek on the major issues of peaceful national construction. In addition to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Democratic League, social figures, and the United States also participated in this negotiation. This negotiation yielded two comprehensive results: one was the minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist talks signed on October 10th and announced on October 12th of last year, in which most of the agreements were reached; the other was the ceasefire order of January 10th this year and the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference of January 31st, in which all the agreements were reached. Recalling the beginning of the negotiations, what great hopes we held; and how elated and inspired we were when the agreements were announced! However, who would have thought that the day after the announcement of the Kuomintang-Communist talks on October 13th, Chiang Kai-shek would issue a secret nationwide order to suppress the Communists, followed by three months of civil war across the country? Moreover, people were not allowed to oppose the civil war, resulting in the so-called "anti-anti-civil war" Kunming Massacre on December 1st. And in February, after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre, the Beijing Incident, and the anti-Soviet demonstrations and vandalism of the *Xinhua Daily* and *Democracy Daily* in Chongqing occurred. Chiang's troops launched serious offensives in the Northeast, Jehol, and Guangdong. In March, the war in the Northeast continued to expand, General Li Zhaolin was assassinated, and a horrifying tragedy occurred in Nantong due to the prohibition of welcoming the executive group. At the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, reactionaries, incited by Chiang Kai-shek, wantonly clamored and, based on Chiang Kai-shek's own proposal, demanded revisions to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. On April 1st, Chiang Kai-shek personally announced the overthrow of the newly established Northeast ceasefire agreement, and a major civil war broke out in the Northeast, with the situation in Hubei becoming serious, and bloodshed occurring in Beijing and Xi'an. In May, the civil war in the Northeast reached its peak, and Chiang's troops within the pass also occupied most of the Yuhong area of Henan, the Dingyuan area of Anhui, the Anci area of Hebei, and the Taiyu Wenjiao area of Shanxi, breaking the record of conflicts since the ceasefire order. At the same time, Shanghai and other cities announced the implementation of the fascist police district system, and Beijing sealed up *Liberation Daily* and seventy-seven other newspapers and periodicals. On June 23rd, peace talks during the truce completely failed because Chiang Kai-shek flagrantly demanded the occupation of northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway, Chengde, and most of the Northeast. During the peace talks, Chiang Kai-shek also created the Xiaguan Massacre, which prohibited petitions for peace, and launched a major offensive against the liberated areas of Jiangsu-Anhui and the Central Plains. In July, the wars in Jiangsu-Anhui, the Central Plains, Jiaoji, and southern Shanxi expanded, and Democratic League Central Committee members Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were assassinated. In August, Chiang's planes bombed Yan'an, and Chiang Kai-shek continued to insist on the arrogant demand to occupy northern Jiangsu and other places. Zheng Jiemin announced that he would take free action against Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde. Chiang Kai-shek used 85% of his forces to attack the liberated areas, the Chongqing Labor Association was sealed, and Democratic League Chairman Zhang Lan was beaten. In short, not only were the results of the two negotiations destroyed, but civil war and fascism have reached unprecedented levels. Today's situation is much worse than the last three months of last year.

Looking back at the facts of this year, the Chinese people have undoubtedly taken a lesson. Chiang Kai-shek, this medieval tutor, first of all, does not allow the people to harbor any illusions about his democratization. In these two agreements, in addition to some issues directly related to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, most were about the rights of the people. For example, the minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist talks stipulated that "the government should guarantee that the people enjoy the freedoms of body, belief, publication, assembly, and association that the people of all democratic countries should enjoy in peacetime," "the government should recognize the equal and legal status of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and all parties," "the government should strictly prohibit agencies other than judicial and police agencies from having the power to arrest, interrogate, and punish the people," "the government should release all political prisoners other than traitors," and "local governments should actively promote local autonomy and implement universal suffrage from top to bottom." The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have more detailed provisions for similar issues. These were originally the Kuomintang's doctrines, programs, and promises, and Chiang Kai-shek had an unconditional obligation to implement them, with no excuses for evasion. Chiang Kai-shek himself said in a speech on April 22, 1937, "If we, as revolutionary parties, only have doctrines but cannot put them into practice, then we do not know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. If we do not know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then what is the difference between a person and a beast?" It can be seen that this is a matter of Chiang Kai-shek's personality. Chiang Kai-shek has been violating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrines for nineteen years. If he still has a bit of humanity, he should reform himself and implement the agreements. But what are the facts? Although he signed, stood up to pass them, and announced them, Chiang Kai-shek still did not implement them. On the one hand, Chiang Kai-shek never implements these, but on the other hand, he always declares in every speech that he is "preparing" to implement them. It seems that he is preparing to act out this set of tricks until he dies. He thinks that his set of tricks can still have some deceptive effect; but is a year of painful lessons not enough to enlighten the 450 million people?

Chiang Kai-shek has given a lesson to the 450 million people, a lesson to the Democratic League and social figures, but even more enthusiastically to the two million Communist Party members: Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly told us through his own actions that he is determined to eliminate the Communist Party, the biggest enemy of his dictatorial plan, and is determined to kill every unyielding Communist Party member with the most cruel punishments so that his fascist system can be implemented without hindrance throughout the country. In the twelve items of the minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist talks, the ninth and tenth items concerning the armed forces and political power of the liberated areas were the most debated and the most unproductive. Why? Because Chiang Kai-shek knows that as long as the armed forces and political power of the liberated areas are eliminated, the Communist Party will be eliminated, the democratic rights will be eliminated, and the people's rights in the other ten items will be eliminated. Therefore, although the Communist Party made huge concessions on these two issues, allowing the gradual withdrawal of its organized people's armed forces from eight regions: Guangdong, Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, central Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and southern Henan, and reducing the total number of the people's armed forces to twenty divisions; on the issue of political power, it also made various concessions according to Chiang Kai-shek's requirements, but still failed to reach an agreement. This year, the Communist Party has made many new concessions, such as acknowledging that after the ceasefire, Chiang Kai-shek could exceptionally transport three more armies to the Northeast, acknowledging that the people's armed forces would be reduced to eighteen divisions at the end of the twelve months of reorganization, and to ten divisions at the end of the eighteen months, and that several divisions would be incorporated into Chiang Kai-shek's divisions to form armies, acknowledging that Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces would have a larger number not only in Central China, but also in North China and the Northeast. However, the agreement was still broken. Later, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army voluntarily withdrew from Changchun, and later, in the June negotiations, the CPC made significant concessions on the three issues of troop deployment, restoration of transportation, and mediation. However, in the end, no new agreement was reached. The facts of the past year fully prove that Chiang Kai-shek's demands are endless. If you give him an inch, he will take a mile. Old agreements can be torn up, and even if new agreements are reached, they can still be torn up. The final agreement he is truly pursuing is the elimination of the Communist Party, the elimination of the independent, peaceful, and democratic movement.

In the past year, the Chinese people have had another new teacher that they cannot forget, the United States government. What the United States government used to tell us was Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, Sino-American equality, Soviet-American cooperation, and the eradication of Japanese aggression. However, in the past year, these courses have been revised by new courses. The United States government and Chiang Kai-shek are now singing a terrifying duet. Anyone who does not like to listen will be arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's police government on the charge of "anti-Americanism" or "anti-Americanism is anti-fatherland." The United States government signed the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference Communiqué, but then violated it, just as Chiang Kai-shek signed the minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist talks and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and then violated them. Chiang Kai-shek, wearing American military uniforms and driving American planes, tanks, and warships, is dropping American bombs, machine gun bullets, cannon shells, rockets, and silenced pistol bullets on the Chinese people, even preparing to release American poison gas, while the American troops guarding Chiang Kai-shek's military strongholds and the American military advisors guiding Chiang Kai-shek in the use of weapons are declaring that their mission is to "protect Chinese peace." When the Chinese people and the American people together criticize the policies of the United States government, the American reactionaries clamor loudly that "the Chinese people are threatening the security of the United States"; and say that in order to show that they are not being directed by Moscow, the Chinese people must sincerely sing the praises of the great virtues of the United States government in creating civil war in China and massacring the Chinese people.

These are the main political lessons we have received in the past year. One year after Japan's surrender, due to the policies of the United States government, Japanese aggression has resurfaced, China's position has rapidly declined, China has become weaker and poorer, Chiang Kai-shek is fighting more actively than he fought against Japan, and the United States government is helping Chiang Kai-shek fight more actively than it helped him fight against Japan. However, all this education is very beneficial to the Chinese people. The people's consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level, and the people's strength has also been unprecedentedly strengthened. Our demands today are the same as a year ago: independence, peace, and democracy. We believe that no matter how Chiang Kai-shek and his American daddy try to undermine them, China's independence, peace, and democracy will definitely be achieved. The Chinese people already have the strength to realize their demands, which are also the demands of the American people and the people of all countries. If Chiang Kai-shek also agrees with these, then please reinstate the ceasefire and reconvene the Political Consultative Conference. However, we will certainly reject any unreasonable demands from Chiang Kai-shek; we will certainly resist any military offensives from Chiang Kai-shek. And when the United States still has its army and navy stationed in China and is still helping Chiang Kai-shek wage civil war, if the United States government pretends to have a "neutral" smile and advises us to make a "small" unilateral concession, saying that this will lead to peace and even democracy, we will certainly tell the advisor: You are a liar! Your mission is only to help Chiang Kai-shek "beautifully" realize dictatorship and eliminate the independence of the Chinese nation and the democracy of the Chinese people.

　　一年的教训
    解放日报社论
    去年八月二十八日，中共中央主席毛泽东等一行飞到重庆与蒋介石谈判和平建国大计，现在整整一年过去了。这一次的谈判，参加的除国民党、共产党外，还有民主同盟、社会贤达和美国。这一次的谈判，得过两次全面的结果：一次是大部获得协议的去年十月十日签订、十二日公布的国共会谈纪要；一次是全部获得协议的今年一月十日的停战令，和一月三十一日的政治协商会议的五项决议。回想谈判之初，我们曾抱着何等的热望；协议公布；我们又何等的欢欣鼓舞！但是，谁料到国共会谈纪要公布的第二天，即十月十三日，蒋介石就发出了全国剿共密令，接着便在全国大打了三个月的内战，打了内战还不许人民反内战，因而在十二月一日便产生了所谓“反反内战”的昆明大惨案。而在政协会闭幕后二月，就发生重庆较场口惨案，北平执行的事件，重庆反苏游行与捣毁新华日报、民主报事件，东北、热河和广东的蒋军就进行严重的进攻。三月东北战事继续扩大，李兆麟将军被暗杀，南通因禁止欢迎执行组而发生骇人的惨案。国民党二中全会上，反动派在蒋介石嗾使之下，肆意叫嚣，并根据蒋介石本人的提议，要求修改政协决议。四月一日，蒋介石亲身出来宣布推翻刚刚成立的东北停战协议，东北大内战爆发，湖北形势严重化，北平西安相继发生血案。五月，东北内战达到顶点，关内蒋军也攻占河南豫东地区、安徽定远地区、河北安次地区、山西太徐文交地区的大部，其规模打破停战令以来冲突的纪录。同时，上海与其他各城市宣布实行法西斯的警管区制，北平查封解放报和其他报刊七十七种。六月二十三天休战中的和平谈判，由于蒋介石悍然要求占领苏北、胶济路、承德与东北大部而完全失败。在和平谈判期间，蒋介石又制造了不准请愿和平的下关惨案，发动了对于苏皖解放区和中原解放区的大举进攻。七月，苏皖、中原、胶济、晋南战事扩大，民主同盟中委李公朴、闻一多被暗杀。八月，蒋机轰炸延安，蒋介石继续坚持占领苏北等地的狂妄要求，郑介民宣布将对延安、张家口、承德采取自由行动，蒋介石以其百分之八十五的兵力进攻解放区，重庆劳动协会被封，民主同盟主席张澜被打。总之，不但两次谈判的结果都被破坏了，且内战和法西斯则却反而达到了空前的规模。今天的情形比去年的末三个月还要坏得多。
    回顾这一年的事实，中国人民无异是上了一次课，蒋介石这个中世纪的塾师，首先是不许人民对他存有任何民主化的幻想。在这两次协议中，除了一部分直接是关于国共两党的问题以外，大部分都是关于人民的权利。譬如国共会谈纪要规定：“政府应保证人民享受一切民主国家人民在平时应享受身体、信仰、出版、集会、结社之自由”，“政府应承认国民党、共产党及一切党派的平等合法地位”，“政府应严禁司法和警察以外机关有拘捕、审讯和处罚人民之权”，“除汉奸以外之政治犯，政府应一律释放”，“各地应积极推行地方自治，实行由上而下的普选”。政协决议案对于同类的问题有更详尽的规定。这些本来都是国民党的主义、纲领、诺言，蒋介石只有无条件实行的义务，决无任何可以规避搪塞的借口。蒋介石自己在二十六年四月二十二日的一个讲演中，也说过“我们作了革命党，只有了主义而不能见诸实行，这就是不知礼义廉耻，不知礼义廉耻，则一个人究竟与禽兽有什么区别呢”？可见这是蒋介石的人格问题。蒋介石十九年来，一直违背孙中山先生的主义，如果还有一点人性，就应该革面洗心实行协议。但是事实怎么样？虽然签字了，起立通过了，公布了，蒋介石还是不实行。蒋介石一方面永远不实行这些，一方面却永远在每一次演说中宣称“准备”实行这些。他的这一套把戏，看来是准备演到死的了。他以为他这一套多少总有些欺骗作用；可是一年来的痛苦教训，难道还不够四万万五千万人的启蒙吗？
    蒋介石给四万万五千万人民上了一课，给民主同盟和社会贤达上了一课，但是更热情的还是给二百多万共产党员上了一课：蒋介石以自己的行为，三番四覆地告诉我们，他决心要消灭他独裁计划的第一大敌共产党，决心要把每一个不屈服的共产党员都用最惨酷的刑法杀死，以便他的法西斯制度在全国通行无阻。在国共会谈纪要的十二个项目中，关于解放区军队、政权的第九、第十两项，争论最多而最无结果，为什么？因为蒋介石知道，只要解放区的军队和政权消灭了，共产党就会随之消灭，民主权力就会随之消灭，其他十项的人民权利也就会一概随之消灭。因此，虽然在这两个问题上共产党都作了巨大的让步，允许从广东、浙江、苏南、皖南、皖中、湖南、湖北、豫南八个地区逐步撤退自己所组织的人民军队，并将人民军队的总数减至二十个师的数目；对于政权问题，也曾循蒋介石的要求作了多种让步，但是依然得不到协议。到了今年内，共产党又作了许多新的让步，譬如承认在停战以后，蒋介石可以例外的向东北再运送三个军，承认人民军队在整编的十二个月终了减为十八个师，十八个月终了减为十个师，并有若干师与蒋介石的师统编为军，承认蒋介石的军队不但在华中，而且在华北与东北也都有较大的数目等等。但是，协议依然被破坏。以后，东北民主联军又自动撤出长春，以后中共在六月的谈判中，关于军队驻地、恢复交通和调处工作三项问题，又都作了重大的让步。但是，最后依然得不到新的协议。一年来的事实，充分证明蒋介石的要求是无穷的，你让他一寸，他就进一尺，旧的协议可以撕毁，新的协议即使成立，当然还是可以撕毁。他所真正追求的最后协议，只是共产党的消灭，是独立和平民主运动的消灭。
    这一年来，中国人民还有一位不能忘记的新教师，就是美国政府。美国政府过去讲给我们听的，是罗斯福的四大自由，是中美平等，美苏合作，肃清日本侵略势力。但是，这一年来，这些课程是被新的课程所修正了，美国政府和蒋介石现在向我们唱着恐怖的双簧，谁要不喜欢听，蒋介石的警管政府就要用“反美”罪或“反美即反祖国”罪加以逮捕。美国政府签字于莫斯科三国外长会议公告，而后又违背它，就如同蒋介石签字于国共会谈纪要和政协决议，而后又违背它们一样。蒋介石穿着美国的军服，驾驶着美国的飞机、坦克和军舰，向中国人民放着美国的炸弹、机关枪弹、炮弹、火箭、与无声手枪弹，以至准备施放美国的毒气弹，而同时替蒋介石看守军事要地的美国军队，和指导蒋介石使用武器的美国军事顾问，却宣布他们的任务是“保护中国和平”。当中国人民和美国人民一起批评美国政府的政策时，美国反动派就大声叫嚣着“中国人民威胁美国的安全”；并且说：中国人民为了表白自己不受莫斯科的指使，就必须竭诚歌颂美国政府制造中国内战、屠杀中国人民的伟大美德。
    这些就是我们在过去一年中所受主要的政治教育。日本投降一年以后，由于美国政府的政策，日本侵略势力重新抬头了，中国的地位迅速下降了，中国变得更弱更穷了，蒋介石打的仗比打日本积极一百倍，美国政府援助蒋介石打仗，也比援助他打日本积极一百倍。但是，这一切教育，对于中国人民十分有益，人民的觉悟性是空前提高了，人民的力量也空前加强了，我们今天的要求和一年以前一样，还是独立、和平和民主。我们相信，无论蒋介石和他的美国爸爸怎样破坏，中国的独立、和平民主还是一定要实现的。中国人民已经有力量实现自己的要求，这同时也是美国人民和世界各国人民的要求，如果蒋介石也赞成这些，那么就请他重新实行停战，重新召开政协会议。但是，蒋介石的任何无理要求，我们一定拒绝；蒋介石任何军事进攻，我们一定抵抗。而当美国还把海陆军驻在中国，还帮助蒋介石进行内战的时候，如果美国政府再装着“中立”的笑脸，劝告我们再作“少许”片面的让步，说这样就可以得到和平甚至民主的时候，我们一定告诉劝告者：你是骗子！你的任务，不过是帮助蒋介石“漂亮”地实现，独裁和消灭中华民族的独立和中国人民的民主。
