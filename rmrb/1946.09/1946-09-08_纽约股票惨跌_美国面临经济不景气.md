Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 2nd: A dispatch from New York: The Wall Street Journal reported on the 29th of last month that the decline in purchasing volume in the American market may be a precursor to an impending economic recession. The sharp drop in the New York stock market this week shows that consumers are extremely cautious when shopping. Furthermore, in American industry and finance, there are also those who express pessimism about the current economic situation in the United States: (1) The Federal Reserve Bank and civilian production plants both believe that rising prices will lead to market stagnation; (2) Experienced Canadian economic commentators predict that an economic recession will occur in the United States; (3) The prices of American manufacturer's product catalogs are falling; (4) Retail stores are accumulating goods. According to a report from the U.S. Civilian Production Administration on the 30th of last month, basic American industries have reached their production limits, and in June, with the exception of automobile production, all other industries were 30 to 50 percent behind the levels of 1941.

　　纽约股票惨跌
    美国面临经济不景气
    【新华社延安二日电】纽约讯：华尔街日报上月二十九日载称：美国市场购买量低减，或为将临经济不景气之预兆。本周纽约股票市场惨跌，可表明消费者购物时极度审慎。又美国工商金融方面，亦有对美国目前经济情况表示悲观者：（１）联邦准备银行及民用生产厂俱认为物价日涨，市面当趋停滞；（２）富有经验之加拿大经济评论家预言，美国将发生经济不景气现象；（３）美国制造家商品目录之价格下跌；（４）零售商店货物堆积。又据美国民用生产管理局上月三十日报告，美国基本工业已达生产的限度，在六月份内除汽车生产外，其他都落后于一九四一年的水平的百分之三十至五十。
