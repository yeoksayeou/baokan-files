　　Heroes of the Lanfeng Self-Defense Battle!
　　(I) Deputy Brigade Commander Zong Cleverly Captures Prisoners
　　Before counterattacking the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Lanfeng, Zong Shuge, the deputy brigade commander of one of our units, personally led a small number of scouts to reconnoiter outside the north gate of Lanfeng. When they approached a Chiang Kai-shek sentry, the sentry asked, "Which unit are you from?" Zong replied, "We are newly arrived from the west (referring to Kaifeng)." Zong then asked in return, "Which unit are you from?" The Chiang Kai-shek soldier replied, "XX Regiment." Zong said, "You can go back and rest; there are no Eighth Route Army soldiers in this area." The Chiang Kai-shek soldier saluted Deputy Brigade Commander Zong and turned to leave. Zong gave a look, and several scouts beside him rushed forward and captured the sentry. Then they advanced further and captured an entire squad of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers along with their weapons.
　　(II) Bugler Disarms Enemy with Bare Hands
　　Liu Wentong, a bugler from the First Platoon of Unit 6017, was near-sighted. As he was searching for his unit, a Chiang Kai-shek soldier suddenly appeared, took out a hand grenade from his waist, and prepared to throw it at him. Liu Wentong reached out and snatched it away, throwing it to the ground. The Chiang Kai-shek soldier then thrust at him with a bayonet. Liu Wentong dodged to the side, grabbed the Chiang Kai-shek soldier's gun with his hand, and with a strong pull, disarmed him. As the Chiang Kai-shek soldier, who had fallen to the ground, was about to flee, Liu Wentong shot and killed him with a backhand shot.
　　(III) Requesting Party Approval
　　Section Chief Du of the organization department was filling out a registration form for Chang Guochun, the squad leader of the ninth squad of the first company of Unit 6048, who was wounded in the leg. He asked Chang Guochun with concern, "Are you a Party member? I'll transfer your organizational affiliation to the hospital." Chang Guochun replied sadly, "I already filled out the form last time, but I don't know if it's been approved yet. I request the Party to approve me, otherwise I would rather die on the front line than go to the hospital." After a short discussion, Section Chief Du solemnly announced, "Alright! Comrade! The Party approves you as a probationary member." Comrade Chang Guochun forgot his pain and left the aid station with a smile on his face. He, the combat hero Chang Guochun, was the first to climb the city wall in the Lanfeng counterattack.
　　(IV) Instructor Ge
　　At the time of departure, Instructor Ge of the Eighth Company was ill, but he helped the soldiers carry a light machine gun and ten small shells, marching thirty *li* rapidly until entering the position. After a fierce battle, Comrade Ge was injured in the shoulder, but he turned around to call out other wounded comrades and direct the battle. He fainted due to excessive bleeding. Two hours later, he was carried to the clinic to apply medicine, and woke up to immediately return to the front line. When the instructor tried to stop him, he became anxious and said, "I can still move, I want to do it to the end!" Like a whirlwind, he climbed the city wall with a machine gun. Due to this sudden attack, the invading army's camp was thrown into chaos, and he took the opportunity to lead the soldiers of the third squad to pursue, capturing seventeen prisoners, seizing four machine guns, two gun carriages, fifteen rifles, and six foreign horses. When the main force entered the city to search for remnants of the enemy, Comrade Ge insisted on staying in front to call out the wounded, giving water to the seriously wounded, until the last wounded person was sent away. Now, fragments of the grenade are still in Comrade Ge's shoulder, but he remains in the company insisting on his work.

　　兰封自卫战的英雄们！
    （一）宗副旅长巧捉俘虏
    在反击兰封蒋军之前，我某部宗书阁副旅长，亲率少数侦察员前往兰封北门外侦察，走到蒋军哨兵跟前，蒋军哨兵问道：“你是那一部分？”宗答：“我是新从西边（指开封）来的。”宗又反问：“你是那一部分？”蒋军答：“××团。”宗说：“你们回去休息吧，这一带没有八路军。”蒋军对宗副旅长敬了礼转身要走，宗一丢眼色，在他身旁的几位侦察员跑上前去把那哨兵俘掳了。接着又往前进，把蒋军一个班的人枪全部俘虏了。
    （二）司号员赤手夺枪
    六○一七部队一小队司号员刘文同是一个近视眼，他正找寻部队时，突然迎面出现一个蒋军，从腰里取出一颗手榴弹要向他投掷，刘文同一伸手夺过来扔到地上，蒋军又向他一枪刺来，刘文同侧身一闪躲过去，顺手一把抓住蒋军的枪，用力一带就把枪夺过来。跌在地上的蒋军正待逃跑，刘文同反手一枪结果了这个蒋军的性命。
    （三）要求党批准我
    杜组织科长一面在登记表上填写：六○四八部队一连九班长常国春腿上负伤，一面关切地问常国春说：“你是党员吗？好给你把组织关系转到医院去。”常国春很难过的回答：“上次已经填了表，可不知批下来没有，我要求党批准我，要不我情愿死在火线上也不到医院去。”经过一小会的讨论后，杜科长庄严的宣布：“好吧！同志！党批准你是候补党员”。常国春同志忘记了疼痛，满面笑容的离开了救护所。这次兰封反击战中六○四八部队一连第一个爬上城墙的就是他——战斗英雄常国春。
    （四）葛指导员
    出发时，八连葛指导员身上有病，他却帮助战士扛了一挺轻机枪和十颗小炮弹，急行军三十里，直至进入阵地。经一阵激战后，葛同志肩膀上带彩了，他却反过来招呼其他彩号，指挥作战。由于流血过多晕过去了，两小时后他被架到卫生所去敷药，醒来马上又回到前线去。当教导员劝止他的时候，他发急了说：“我还能动作，我就要干到底！”一股旋风似的夹着一挺机枪爬上了城墙，经他这一突然的袭击，进犯军的阵营混乱了，他并乘机带领着三班战士们前往追击，捕捉了十七个俘虏，缴获了四挺机枪，二个炮架，十五支步枪，六匹洋马。大部队进城搜索残敌的时候，葛同志仍坚持留在前面招呼彩号，给重彩号喂水，直到送走最后一个彩号为止。现在葛同志肩膀上的手榴弹碎片还没有取出来，却仍留在连队里坚持工作。
