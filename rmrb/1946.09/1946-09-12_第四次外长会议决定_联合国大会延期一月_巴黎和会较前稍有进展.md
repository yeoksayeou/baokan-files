Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: Paris Final News: The Council of Foreign Ministers has decided to recommend that the United Nations General Assembly be postponed from September 23rd to October 23rd. The fourth meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers began at 9:00 PM last night and lasted four hours. Participants included Molotov and Vyshinsky for the Soviet Union, Byrnes for the United States, Alexander for the United Kingdom (who replaced Bevin, who returned to London over the weekend to attend the Palestine Conference), and Bidault for France. Wang Shijie represented China, and Spaak, the President of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, also attended the meeting. Molotov chaired the meeting, which decided that Spaak should notify UN Secretary-General Lie by telephone that the five countries, the Soviet Union, France, China, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, considered it extremely difficult to hold the UN General Assembly and the Peace Conference at the same time and requested a postponement. Byrnes stated that while the United States would not participate in the request for postponement, it would not oppose it. Regarding the location of the meeting, the foreign ministers did not express opinions and further consultations are needed. The foreign ministers agreed that the Council of Foreign Ministers should complete the final draft of the five-nation peace treaty as soon as possible after the Peace Conference. The foreign ministers also agreed to discuss the German question and determine the date for reviewing the Austrian question.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: Comprehensive Report: In the work of the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers, there are two important issues that urgently need to be resolved. The first is the specific handling of more than 200 amendments to the draft treaties, which is the central task of the Council of Foreign Ministers' Assistants. It is reported that the meeting has made "slight progress," and the results have also had some positive impact on the discussions at the Peace Conference. Recently, the Big Four representatives have generally taken a unified approach in rejecting certain amendments, but on other issues, such as the Trieste issue, there are still differences that need to be addressed directly by the four foreign ministers. The second issue is the United Nations General Assembly, which is the direct agenda of the fourth meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for last night. One of the issues to be decided is the date, and there is already a symbolic extension. According to a United Press dispatch from Paris on September 7th, at the third meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, "the United States was found to be in a practical minority, still insisting that the General Assembly be held as originally scheduled (i.e., September 23rd), while the Soviet Union, France, and China decided to support the extension, and the United Kingdom tended to this decision." The second is the venue. The Soviet Union had proposed changing it to Paris or Geneva, because if the Paris Peace Conference lasted longer than expected, it could proceed simultaneously with the UN General Assembly. France conditionally agreed to this proposal, while the United States and the United Kingdom opposed it. The third is the agenda of the UN General Assembly. Bevin advocated "limiting the UN General Assembly to discussing only minor issues"; Molotov disagreed with restricting the agenda of the General Assembly, pointing out that this would damage the dignity of the General Assembly. The Soviet Union believed that the agenda of this General Assembly should "include the review of important issues." And his proposal to postpone the General Assembly to between November 15th and 20th was originally to allow UN member states participating in the Peace Conference time to prepare for the work of the UN General Assembly. Fourth, when discussing issues of the UN General Assembly, the Soviet chairman invited UN Secretary-General Lie to attend the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The United States and the United Kingdom opposed this, so Spaak, the President of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, replaced Lie, and Wang Shijie was also invited to participate.

　　第四次外长会议决定
    联合国大会延期一月
    巴黎和会较前稍有进展
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎最后消息：外长会议已决定建议联合国大会自九月廿三日延至十月廿三日举行。第四次外长会议于昨晚九点开始，历时四小时，参加者苏联为莫洛托夫与维辛斯基，美国为贝纳斯，英国为亚历山大（他代替于周末返回伦敦参加巴勒斯坦会议的贝文），法国为比道尔。中国为王世杰，联合国第一届大会主席斯巴克亦出席会议，由莫洛托夫任主席，会上决定由斯巴克以电话通知联合国秘书长莱氏，告以苏法中英比五国认为联合国大会与和会同时举行至为困难，请求延期。贝纳斯称：美国虽不参加请求延期，亦不反对延期。关于会址问题，各外长未表示意见，尚待协商。各外长同意在和会之后外长会议当尽速完成五国和约的最后草案。各外长亦同意将讨论德国问题，并讨论确定审议奥国问题的日期。
    【新华社延安九日电】综合报导：巴黎外长会议的工作中，有两个重要问题急需解决。首先是具体处理各条约草案之二百余件修正案问题，这是外长助理会议的中心任务。据悉：会议已“稍有进展”，其结果在和会的讨论中也有一些积极影响增加。最近某些修正案的否决，四强代表大体上采取一致步调，但在其他一些问题上，譬如的里亚雅斯特问题，仍有分歧，有待于四强外长直接处理。其次是联合国大会问题，这是定于昨晚召开的第四次外长会议的直接议程，其中待决的问题一是会期，目前已有延长的象征。据合众社巴黎七日电称：第三次外长会议上“发现美国为一个实际的少数，至今仍坚持大会按原期（即九月廿三日）举行，苏法中决定支持展期，英国倾向于此种决定”。二是会址，苏联曾提议改在巴黎或日内现举行，因为如巴黎和会万一比预料的时间长，则可以与联合国大会同时并进。法国有条件的同意此一主张，美英反对。三是联合国大会的议题，贝文主张“限定联合国大会只讨论一些次要问题”；莫洛托夫则不同意限制大会的议程，指出这有损大会的尊严，苏联认为这次大会的议程，应“包含审议重要的问题在内”。而他之提议将大会展期至十一月十五日至廿日之间，原是使参加和会的联合国会员国有时间去准备联合国大会的工作。四是讨论联合国大会诸问题时，外长会议的列席人，苏联主席邀请联合国秘书长莱氏参加，美英反对，乃由联合国第一届大会的主席斯巴克代替莱氏，并邀王世杰参加。
