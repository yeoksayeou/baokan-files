　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 22nd: United Press International, Warsaw: The Speaker of the Polish National Assembly, Beirut, sharply criticized Benes and Churchill on the 21st when the National Assembly met to discuss the election law and determine the date of the parliamentary elections. He said: Benes' speech in Stuttgart and Churchill's speech in Zurich have begun a serious situation that will cause great disasters. Poland has now established its border on the Oder and Neisse rivers, and no force can drive the Polish people from their regained territory. After Beirut's speech, the deputies pledged to "defend the territory with the last drop of blood." Furthermore, Associated Press reported: The Polish election law draft submitted to the National Assembly on the 21st stipulates that 444 representatives will be elected, of which 372 will be elected from regional lists, and 72 will be elected from the national candidate list as general representatives. The draft has the support of the Communist Party, but is opposed by Mikołajczyk's Peasant Party.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 22nd: Moscow Radio yesterday commented on Churchill's speech in Zurich, Switzerland, on the 19th. Churchill called for the rapid organization of a European conference to establish a "United States of Europe" led by France and Germany while the United States still possessed the atomic bomb. In response, the radio commentary said: The purpose of this suggestion is to provoke a war against the Soviet Union. The broadcast said: There are now two trends of rule in the world: the first is the progressive elements demanding peace, and the second is the imperialist expansionist group - they demand force and an arms race. Wallace advocates a return to Roosevelt's foreign policy, while Churchill demands the latter. It also said: Churchill is always giving war-provoking speeches at universities, first at Fulton College (note: referring to Churchill's first anti-Soviet speech in the United States on March 5th), and now at the University of Zurich. The broadcast revealed that Churchill demanded the establishment of a Franco-German alliance, and that this alliance should "jointly lead with Britain and the United States in all important matters." This plan is to establish a strong regional alliance in Europe so that Britain and the United States can use it to oppose the Soviet Union. The broadcast concluded: Churchill linked his speech with Benes' speech in Germany on the 6th of this month. He attached great importance to Benes' proposal, namely, that the crimes of German imperialists should be forgotten and an agreement should be reached to ensure Anglo-American surveillance of Europe, in order to carry out an anti-Soviet war.

    波兰决确保已获国土           
    莫斯科广播斥邱氏挑动反苏战争
    【新华社延安二十二日电】合众社华沙讯：波兰国民议会主席贝鲁特，二十一日在国民议会开会讨论选举法、并决定国会选举日期时，尖锐抨击贝纳斯与邱吉尔，他说：贝纳斯在斯图加特及邱吉尔在苏黎支的演说，开始了将造成大灾难的严重情势，波兰现已在奥德河和尼斯河建立了国界，没有任何力量可以把波兰人从他们重获的领土上赶走。贝氏演讲后，议员均提出保证“以最后一滴血保卫领土”。又美联社讯：二十一日呈交国民议会的波兰选举法草案，规定选举代表四百四十四人，其中三百七十二人由区域名单中选出，七十二人由全国候选人名单中选出，作为一般代表。该草案得到共产党的支持，但受到米柯拉兹科农民党的反对。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】莫斯科昨日广播评论邱吉尔十九日在瑞士苏黎支的演说，邱氏要求在原子弹尚由美国掌握之际，迅速组织欧洲会议，建立一个由法德两国领导的“欧洲合众国”。对此，广播评论说：这个建议目的，是在挑拨对苏战争。广播说：现在世界上有两种统治的倾向，第一是要求和平的进步因素，第二是帝国主义的扩张集团——他们要求武力与军备竞赛。华莱士拥护回返罗斯福外交政策的主张，邱吉尔却要求后者。又说：邱吉尔总是在大学里发表挑拨战争的演说，起先在福尔顿学院（按即三月五日邱氏在美国第一次作反苏演说），现在则在苏黎支大学。广播揭露说：邱吉尔要求建立德法联盟，并且要这个联盟“在一切重要事件上与英国及美国共同负责领导”，这个计划就是要在欧洲建立一个强大的区域联盟，好让英美利用来反对苏联。广播结语说：邱吉尔把他的演说与贝纳斯本月六日在德国的演说联系起来，他对贝纳斯的提议，即应该忘记德国帝国主义者的罪行、并达到协议以保证英美对欧洲的监视，来进行反苏战争的提议，极堪重视。
