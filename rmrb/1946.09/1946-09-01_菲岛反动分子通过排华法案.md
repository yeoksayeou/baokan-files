　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Manila dispatch: The Philippine Senate passed a "Philippine Nationalization of Public Markets Act" on the 23rd. This act will squeeze overseas Chinese out of public markets, affecting as many as 3,000 people in Manila alone. Overseas Chinese planned to build their own market, but this has been prohibited by the Philippine authorities. It is reported that the "Philippine Nationalization of Public Markets Act" is the first step by the Philippine reactionaries to exclude overseas Chinese. The Philippine court is currently further discussing the "Philippine Nationalization of Retail Trade" and "Philippine Nationalization of Labor" bills. If these are also passed, most of the 160,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines will be displaced. When the above cases were submitted to the parliament, the overseas Chinese business community appealed to the Chiang Kai-shek government to take appropriate measures to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. However, the Chiang government turned a blind eye, causing the interests of thousands of overseas Chinese to be deliberately excluded by the Philippine reactionaries.

　　菲岛反动分子通过排华法案
    【新华社延安二十八日电】马尼拉讯：菲律滨参议院二十三日通过一“公共市场菲化法案”。此案将使华侨从公共市场被排挤出来，仅马尼拉一地，即有三千名之多。华侨拟自建一市场，但已被菲当局禁止。据悉“公共市场菲化法案”，是菲律滨反动派排斥华侨的第一步骤。菲法院刻正进一步讨论“零售业菲化”及“劳工菲化”两法案，如续被通过，则住菲十六万华侨中的大部即将流离失所。上述各案提交议会当时，华侨商界曾吁请蒋介石政府采取适当措施保护华侨利益，惟蒋政府熟视无睹，致成千侨胞的利益开始为菲反动分子故意排斥。
