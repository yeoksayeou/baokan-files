　　Northwest Democratic Allied Army Thirty-eighth Army
　　Commander Kong Congzhou and Deputy Commander Liu Weicheng's Telegram to Compatriots Nationwide
　　[Our Newspaper, Handan, 15th] The text of the inauguration telegram of Generals Kong and Liu of the Thirty-eighth Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army is as follows:

　　President Chiang at Guling, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu at Yan'an, all military divisions and regiments, legal entities, newspapers, and compatriots of all walks of life across the country:

　　Our army is the Northwest People's Revolutionary Armed Forces founded by General Yang Hucheng. Under the leadership of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, it was initially the First Detachment of the Third Route Army of the Jingguo Army. For thirty years, it has consistently strived to realize the democratic revolution of the Three People's Principles. During the Xinhai Revolution, it cooperated with the national revolutionary movement to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. Subsequently, during the warlord melee, our army was trapped in Xi'an, fighting fiercely for eight months, finally defeating the Zhen Song Army that plundered the people of the Northwest and attacked the Northwest revolutionary base. During the Northern Expedition, our army left Tongguan and fought in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei, with battles spanning the Central Plains. Its contributions were met with jealousy. During the ten years of civil war, our army suffered from the devastation and oppression of the Nanjing government, cutting off its supplies, attempting to use heavy troops to slander the Northwest People's Revolutionary Armed Forces as "bandits," and calls for disbandment and resettlement were incessant. General Yang Hucheng was once forced to leave. In an environment of hunger and cold, the entire army and its officers and soldiers persevered and resolutely fought against the reactionary forces.

　　The "Double Twelve" Incident was an important link in stopping the civil war and saving the nation. However, Generals Zhang and Yang were imprisoned for demanding unity against foreign aggression and national construction. After the "July 7th" Incident, all officers and soldiers of our army took the lead in requesting to fight the enemy, willing to fight the national enemy to the death, rushing to the front line day and night. We fought once in Baoding, again at Niangziguan, and a third time at Xuehua Mountain, defending the Fengmenkou and holding the Zhongtiao Mountains, fighting against the enemy on the line between the cities of Ba Wang and Han Wang for two years. During the Central Plains campaign, our army fought alone, with numerous deaths, and even during melee and bloody battles with stubborn enemies, some direct troops of the Central Government stood by and watched, not only not providing assistance but also applauding. All officers and soldiers of the army were heartbroken, but considering the enemy at the forefront and the nation in peril, they did not pursue the matter. They all were determined to fight and die for the country and the nation. What regrets would there be?

　　After the Japanese surrender, democratic nation-building has become the urgent demand of the people across the country. Various democratic parties, representing the will of the people, gathered together and personally signed three major agreements, unanimously willing to strive for an independent, free, peaceful, and democratic new China based on the Three People's Principles. The Communist Party has repeatedly declared, "considering the Three People's Principles as necessary for China today, our party is willing to strive for its thorough realization," and has truly realized the democratic politics of the Three People's Principles in the Liberated Areas. If our party can treat each other with sincerity and the authorities abandon their prejudices, it is not too late to build the country peacefully from now on. However, just as the people were celebrating with joy, some fascists and warmongers within our party blatantly disregarded the will of the people and, for the selfish interests of small groups, provoked attacks, and the flames of civil war spread across the country again. Chiang Kai-shek not only tore up the agreements he had personally signed and revoked the promises he had solemnly made, but also openly colluded with American imperialists to frantically slaughter compatriots with foreign armed forces, a tragedy unprecedented, even more than what Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Cao Kun dared to do. Our Chinese nation, which had fought for more than eight years and finally defeated the Japanese invasion, is about to be reduced to an American slave. What is the meaning of the National Revolution? What remains of the independent and autonomous nation? At this time, acting on orders would not only shame the spirit of the late Premier but also cause fratricide and, in particular, deepen the shame of betraying the country. Moreover, because we were affiliated with miscellaneous troops, we were placed at the forefront of the "shameful march." The three armies wept, and there was no way to remonstrate. Refusing the chaotic orders was truly a last resort! In the past, the late Premier repeatedly warned: "The people are the masters of the country" and "The people have the right to manage the affairs of the country." He also said: "The people's rights of the Kuomintang are shared by all ordinary people, not privately owned by a few." Our army, in order to carry out the Premier's teachings, uphold the patriotic and defending people's duty, and oppose the rebellious and traitorous acts that harm the people, resolutely launched uprisings in the Yuxi and Yubei areas, aiming to contain the raging waves and save the country from peril. Now, we are reuniting the old troops nurtured by the people of the Northwest and establishing the Northwest People's Revolutionary Armed Forces—the Thirty-eighth Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, under the jurisdiction of the original Seventeenth and Fifty-fifth Divisions. Kong Congzhou was publicly elected as the army commander, and Liu Weicheng was elected as the deputy army commander. Both took the oath of office at the Handan military headquarters on September 13. We have always advocated that we are willing to join hands with friendly parties and friendly armies who oppose dictatorship and civil war and demand peace and democracy, and vow to sacrifice to the end for the survival of the nation and the country and the expectations of the people across the country! We advocate the immediate and full implementation of the three major resolutions. Unconditionally stop the full-scale civil war. Immediately release Generals Zhang and Yang and all political prisoners. Demand the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China and stop all acts of colluding with American imperialists to invade China. Unite and strive for an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China. We hope that our revolutionary pioneers, compatriots across the country, and elders in the Northwest will not abandon us from afar but will come forward to teach us. We send this sincere telegram and hope you will understand.

　　Kong Congzhou, Army Commander of the National Revolutionary Army, Northwest Democratic Allied Army, Army Thirty-eighth Army, Deputy Commander Liu Weicheng, Chief of Staff Wang Ruzhao, leading all officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth and Fifty-fifth Divisions respectfully (Yuan)

　　西北民主联军第三十八军
    孔刘正副军长致电全国同胞
    【本报邯郸十五日电】西北民主联军三十八军孔刘两将军之就职通电，原文如次：
    牯岭蒋主席，延安毛主席朱总司令全国各军师各法团各报馆，暨全国各界男女同胞公鉴：
    本军为杨虎城将军所手创之西北人民革命武装，受故总理中山先生之领导，初为靖国军第三路第一支队，三十年来，始终为实现三民主义的民主革命而奋斗，辛亥之役，配合全国革命运动，颠覆满清，建立民国，旋值军阀混战，本军困守西安，激战八阅月，终于击溃掠夺西北人民进攻西北革命基地的镇嵩军，北伐战役，本军出潼关转战于豫、鲁、苏、皖、鄂各省，战迹遍于中原，功劳返遭嫉忌，十年内战，本军备受南京政府之摧残压迫，断其补给，图以重兵诬蔑西北人民革命武装，为“土匪”，解决遣散之声不绝于耳，杨虎城将军一度被迫出走，全军将士在饥寒交迫的环境中，不屈不挠，坚决与反动势力作斗争。
    “双十二”兵谏，实为停止内战，救亡图存之重要环节，然张杨两将军，却因要求团结御侮革命建国而被囚禁，“七七”事变，本军全体将士率先请缨杀敌，愿与民族敌人决一死战，星夜驰赴前线，一战于保定，再战于娘子关，三战于雪花山，御敌封门口，固守中条山，对战于霸王汉王两城之线者两年之久，中原战役，本军孤军奋战，死亡枕藉，甚至与顽敌肉搏血战之时，竟有中央嫡系部队，袖手旁观，不但不援而且拍手称快，全军将士疾首痛心，但念大敌当前民族垂危，不与计较，咸皆抱定决心，誓为国家民族而战死，夫复何憾？
    日寇投降，民主建国，已为全国人民之迫切要求，各民主党派，代表民意，欢聚一堂，亲手签订三大协定，一致愿为独立自由、和平民主的三民主义新中国而努力。共产党早已一再宣言，“认为三民主义为中国今日所必须，本党愿为其彻底实现而奋斗，”且已在解放区内，真正实现三民主义的民主政治，果本党能推诚相与，当局者放弃私见，从此和平建国尚未为晚，然正当人民额手相庆之际，本党内一部分法西斯、好战分子，竟悍然不顾民意，为小集团之私利，挑动进攻，内战烽火又复弥漫全国。蒋介石既撕毁自己亲手签订之协定取消自己信誓昭昭之诺言，更公然勾结美帝国主义者以外国武装疯狂屠戮同胞，惨剧空前，为袁世凯、段祺瑞、曹锟辈之所不敢为，我血战八年有余的中华民族甫经战胜日本侵略，又势将沦为美国奴隶，国民革命之意义何在？独立自主之国体何存？当斯时也，秉命而行，不仅愧对先总理之灵，自残骨肉，尤深卖国投靠之辱；况复因系属杂牌，而被配置于“耻辱的进军”之最前线，三军饮泣，诤谏无从，乱命之拒，实非得已！昔者先总理谆谆告诫：“人民是国家的主人”“人民有管理国家大事之权”。又云：“若国民党之民权，则为一般平民所共有，非少数者所得而私也”，本军为奉行总理遗教，本爱国卫民天职反对叛党叛国殃民以逞之悖行，遂毅然先后起义于豫西豫北一带，旨在遏彼狂涛，挽救危亡。兹更重新团结我西北人民所培育之旧部建立西北人民革命武装，——西北民主联军陆军三十八军，辖原属十七、五十五两师，公举从周为军长，威诚为副军长，均于九月十三日在邯郸军次宣誓就职，本一向主张，愿与反对独裁内战要求和平民主的友党友军携手前进，誓为民族国家之生存及全国人民之企望而牺牲到底！我们主张，立即全部实现三大决议。无条件停止全面内战。即刻释放张杨两将军及一切政治犯。要求撤退驻华美军，制止勾结美帝国主义者之一切侵华行为。团结起来，为独立和平民主的新中国而奋斗。望我革命先进，全国同胞，西北父老，不遗在远，进而教之。掬诚电达，诸乞亮察。
    国民革命军，西北民主联军，陆军第三十八军军长孔从周，副军长刘威诚，参谋长王汝昭率十七师五十五师全体官兵叩（元）
