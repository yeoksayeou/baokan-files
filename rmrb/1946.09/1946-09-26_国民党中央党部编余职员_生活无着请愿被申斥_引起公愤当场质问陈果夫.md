　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: Nanjing News: Over six hundred laid-off staff members (previous telegram mistakenly stated two to three hundred) of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, who petitioned the Central Standing Committee on the 4th, were unreasonably rebuked by the committee's secretary. This immediately aroused public outrage, almost leading to violence. Finally, Chen Guofu was forced to come out and accept the petition from the masses, and the petitioning masses left, hoping for a resolution.

　　It is reported that the total number of staff members laid off from various departments and committees of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters reached over one thousand. Because the laid-off personnel were unable to make a living and felt that the authorities' layoff methods were extremely unfair, they jointly organized a "Laid-off Personnel Friendship Association." On the 3rd, they sent representatives to petition the Central Standing Committee, but were refused a meeting. Therefore, the public was indignant, and at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th, they gathered six hundred laid-off personnel, formed a line, and went to the Central Standing Committee to petition again. It was agreed in advance that if the Central Standing Committee still refused to see them, they would go to Lushan to see Chiang Kai-shek and see how he would respond.

　　Seeing the situation was not good, the Central Standing Committee sent a secretary to meet them. Without distinguishing right from wrong, he severely rebuked the petitioning masses, saying, "You are all party members, and you all work in the party headquarters. Why are you doing this? Petitioning and protesting are things the CCP does. Why are you following them?" Upon hearing this, the masses were even more furious, and shouts of "beat him" arose, causing chaos. Chen Guofu, hearing the news, had no choice but to come forward in person. At that time, the petition representatives raised the following questions to Chen:

　　(1) What standards are the layoffs based on? If you think we are not good enough, there are many others who are even worse.

　　(2) According to the resolution, the laid-off personnel should receive their September salaries, but now it is announced that they will not be paid. What is the reason for this?

　　(3) According to the resolution, laid-off personnel who have worked in the party headquarters for one year will receive an extra month's salary, two years two months, and so on. But now it has been changed to 200,000 yuan for one year and 400,000 yuan for two years. This is a great disadvantage for staff members with salaries above 200,000 yuan. What is the reason for this?

　　(4) When staff members returned to Nanjing after demobilization, according to the original regulations, those with family members would receive an additional 480,000 yuan for children's expenses, but everyone actually only received 360,000 yuan. What is the reason for this?

　　Chen Guofu, with a guilty conscience, pretended not to know and said that he would reply after investigating and promised to issue the September salaries, while asking everyone not to make trouble to avoid washing dirty linen in public. The petitioning masses expressed dissatisfaction with Chen's reply.

　　After returning, everyone discussed again. Some said, "If we don't get a satisfactory answer, we will invite reporters and report all the corruption, embezzlement, cronyism, and malpractice of these guys, regardless of whether it washes dirty linen in public!" Some said, "These guys are not only afraid of the expansion of democracy outside the party, but also afraid of the expansion of democracy within the party, because once there is democracy within the Kuomintang, these guys will collapse." Some said, "If we don't get a satisfactory answer, we will sign a statement in the newspaper and withdraw from the Kuomintang!"

　　This movement is developing. According to those familiar with the inside story, the main reason for this petition is the lack of livelihood, but it is also mixed with internal contradictions.

　　国民党中央党部编余职员
　　生活无着请愿被申斥
　　引起公愤当场质问陈果夫
    【新华社延安二十三日电】南京讯：国民党中央党部编余职员六百余人（前电误为二三百人），四日向中常会请愿时，曾遭该会秘书无理申斥，当场激起公愤，几至动武，最后陈果夫被迫出来接受群众的请愿书，请愿群众遂幸幸离去，暂时静候解决。据悉：此次国民党中央党部各部会裁员总数共达一千余人，被裁人员因生活无着，且感当局裁员办法极不公允，乃联合组织“编余人员联谊社”，于三日推派代表至中常会请愿，讵被拒绝接见，因此群情愤激，即于四日上午十时集合编余人员六百余人，整队再赴中常会请愿。事先商定如中常会再不肯见，即到庐山去见蒋介石，看他如何回答。中常会见势不妙，即派一秘书接见，不分皂白，向请愿群众大肆申斥，并说：“你们都是党员，而且都在党部工作，为什么来这一套，请愿抗议这是中共的事，你们为什么要跟着他们作！”群众听到，更加气愤万分，一时喊打之声四起，秩序大乱，陈果夫闻悉，遂不得不亲自出面，当时各请愿代表并向陈提出下列质问：（一）这次裁员究竟根据什么标准，如认为我们不行，则那些更不行的大有人在。（二）依照决议，被裁人员应领得九月份的薪水，但现在又宣布不发了，这是什么道理？（三）依照决议，被裁人员如在党部工作一年的，多发一个月薪水，二年的两个月，依此类推，但现在改为一年的二十万元，二年的发四十万元，这对在二十万薪水以上的职员吃亏不小，又是什么道理？（四）工作人员复员到南京，按原规定有家眷的人另发子女费四十八万元，但大家实际只得三十六万元，这又是什么道理？陈果夫作贼心虚，佯称不知，说待查明后答复，并允照发九月份薪水，同时要大家不要闹，以免家丑外扬。请愿群众对陈答复，表示不满。回来后，大家又商量，有的说：“如果没有圆满答复，我们就招待记者，把这班家伙贪污、腐化、营私、舞弊的情形通通报告出来，管他什么家丑外扬不外扬！”有的说：“这班家伙不只是害怕党外民主伸张，同时也怕党内民主伸张，因为国民党内一有民主，这班家伙也就垮了。”有的说：“如不就得到圆满答复，大家签名登报退出国民党！”现在这一运动正在发展中，据熟悉内情者谈：这次请愿主要原因，为生活无着所致，但同时也渗杂着内部矛盾。
