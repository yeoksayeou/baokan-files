Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: Paris dispatch: Following a proposal by British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to resume at 4:00 PM on the 24th at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to a United Press International dispatch from Paris on September 24th: "The Four Foreign Ministers will meet today in the most harmonious atmosphere in weeks, making a final effort to accelerate the work of the peace conference, resolve the confusion and disagreements, and allow it to adjourn by the October 15th deadline." UPI also stated: "This is a significant characteristic of the past eight weeks. Three recent major events may provide the background for the conference to achieve success: (1) Soviet leader Stalin's interview with a British journalist stating that there is no danger of war, only the clamor of military adventurers. (2) Former British Foreign Secretary Eden's call for all Allied nations to "restore the spirit that once inspired them," a view that contrasts with former British Prime Minister Churchill's indirect call for Europe to organize against the communist threat. (3) The resolution of the American Wallace affair, although a technical victory for Byrnes' tough policy, has made American officials aware of the world's reaction to the division between East and West. The weight of history is causing senior figures to carefully study US-Soviet relations." It is understood that this meeting was initiated by Bevin after private meetings with Byrnes, Molotov, and Bidault on the 21st and 23rd afternoons.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: Reuters dispatch from Paris: The Soviet Union reiterated on the 23rd its support for South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and India to discuss the handling of the Italian colonies in Africa. It is reported that during a previous meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Molotov firmly told Bevin that the self-governing dominions and India, which had made significant contributions to the liberation of the former Italian colonies in Africa, should be entitled to present their views to the Four Powers before the final decision on the fate of the Italian colonies. On the 23rd, after the Four Powers' declaration on the Italian colonies was announced, Bevin raised this issue. The declaration stated that, considering the wishes and welfare of the local residents, and taking into account the views of other relevant governments, the territories concerned would be finally handled by the Four Powers. Molotov stated that he considered South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and India to be "relevant governments."

　　四外长会议复会
　　俾加速解决和会混乱与分歧
    【新华社延安二十五日电】巴黎讯：依照英外相贝文的提议，四强外长会议定二十四日下午四时在法外交部复会。据合众社巴黎二十四日电称：“四强外长今日将在数周来最和谐的气氛中开会，以予最后努力，加速和会工作，解决混乱与分歧，使其能在十月十五日截止期休会。”合众社并称：“此为八周来之显著特点，最近三件大事，可能成为和会能够成就之背景：（一）苏联领袖斯大林对英记者之谈话称，并无战争危险，只是军事冒险家之喧嚷而已。（二）英前外相艾登呼吁各盟国“恢复曾经鼓舞他们的这种精神”，此种论调与英前首相邱吉尔间接号召欧洲组织起来反对共产党威胁之论点相反。（三）美华莱士事件之解决，虽为贝纳斯强硬政策技术上的胜利，但已使美国官员了解世界对东西两方分裂之反响，繁重历史正使高级人士仔细研究美苏关系。”据悉：此次会议乃贝文于二十一日及二十三日下午与贝纳斯、莫洛托夫及比道尔作私人晤谈后发起者。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】路透社巴黎讯：苏联于二十三日重申其赞成南非、澳洲、新西兰、加拿大、印度商谈处理非洲意大利殖民地问题。据悉：前次苏外长莫洛托夫与英外相贝文会谈时，莫洛托夫曾确告贝文对前意大利非洲殖民地之解放曾贡献重大力量之各自治领与印度，在对意殖民地之命运作最后决议之前，应有资格向四强申述其意见。二十三日，四强关于意殖民地的宣言公布之后，贝文曾经提出此问题。该宣言称：鉴于当地居民的愿望与福利，及考虑了其他有关政府的意见之后，有关领土将由四强最后处理之。莫洛托夫称：他认为南非、澳洲、新西兰、加拿大与印度，均为“有关政府”。
