　　County and District Important Cadre Meeting
    Inspects Autumn Harvest Preparation Work
    Breaks the Complacency Persists in Long-Term Self-Defense
    Strengthens Unity Strengthens Propaganda
    Launches Various Struggles Against Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Regime
    Another dispatch: In order to further mobilize and inspect the arrangements for preparing for war, arranging the autumn harvest, and armed grain seizure, Anyang convened a meeting of important county and district cadres on September 15th. Inspections revealed that many cadres and masses still harbored complacency and lacked a sufficient understanding of the long-term and complex struggle situation. The old liberated areas generally failed to sufficiently emphasize war preparation. In the border areas, preparations were not fully made before the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's offensive, resulting in the complete looting of grain and property from the masses in villages such as Quyang and Liusi. Most of the evacuated village cadres, militia, and tens of thousands of refugees did not bring food or clothing. Complacency still exists in some villages east of Shuiye. Deputy Political Commissar Qin emphasized during the mobilization, "Break all complacency, clear your minds, and take a long-term perspective." He called on the masses of the entire county to fully prepare for war. Effectively organize all able-bodied men and women in the county, implement temporary large-scale work exchange, and effectively combine war preparation, participation in the war, autumn harvest, autumn planting, and the emancipation movement, making specific and appropriate arrangements. Currently, the old liberated areas in the hinterland should focus on the autumn harvest and autumn planting, combined with war preparation, and carry out anti-espionage and anti-special agent work, thoroughly implementing the policy of "land to the tiller." Border areas should concentrate their efforts on organizing armed protection of the autumn harvest, thoroughly clearing the fields and houses, and organizing planned transfers and retreats. They should also organize refugee armed grain seizures. After a heated discussion, everyone's confidence in victory was doubled. It was unanimously believed that: a widespread mass patriotic war propaganda movement must be launched, using all current examples to stimulate the masses' fighting spirit, ensuring that all work in the front and rear is carried out in time to seize the autumn harvest and prepare for war, strengthen centralized leadership, improve the entire organization for leading the war, and strengthen unity between the troops and the local areas, between militia supporting from other counties and the militia of this county, between superiors and subordinates, between villages, between cadres, and between cadres and the masses. Launch struggles on all fronts against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime. Finally, the leadership further called on the county's four thousand emancipated heroes to strive to become labor heroes and enemy-killing heroes on the production front and in the patriotic self-defense war. The entire county should establish 30,000 militiamen and develop 100,000 peasant association members, in order to victoriously smash the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's offensive and defend our good times.

　　县区重要干部集会
    检查秋收备战工作
    打破麻痹思想坚持长期自卫
    加强团结加强宣传
    向蒋伪展开各种斗争
    又讯：安阳为进一步动员与检查备战布置秋收与武装抢收工作。在九月十五日曾召开县区重要干部会议，检查中发现不少干部群众仍存在麻痹思想，对长期复杂的斗争局势认识不够。老区普遍未能十分重视备战工作，在蒋伪进攻前，边沿区亦未能充分备战，致曲阳、流寺等村群众的粮食财物被劫一空，撤出之村干部，民兵及数万难民，绝大部分未带粮食衣服。水冶以东若干村庄，仍有麻痹现象。秦副政委在动员中特别强调“打破一切麻痹思想，清醒头脑，从长期着眼”，号召全县群众，充分做好备战工作。有效地组织全县男女劳力，实行临时大变工，把备战、参战、秋收、秋耕、及翻身运动很好的结合起来，作出具体适当按排。目前老区腹地应突击秋收及秋耕，结合备战，进行反奸反特，贯彻实行耕者有其田。边地应集中力量组织武装保卫秋收，彻底空室清野，有计划的组织转移退却，并应组织难民武装抢收，经过热烈讨论，大家胜利信心加倍提高，一致认为：必须展开广泛的群众性爱国战争宣传运动，用一切现实例子激发群众斗争情绪，保证前后方一切工作争取时间突击秋收备战，加强一元化领导，健全整套领导战争的机构，加强部队与地方间，外县支援民兵与本县民兵间，上级与下级间，村与村间，干部相互间，干部与群众间的团结。向蒋伪展开各种战线的斗争。最后领导上更号召全县四千翻身英雄要在生产战线上及保家爱国的自卫战争中争取劳动英雄与杀敌英雄，全县建立三万民兵，发展十万农会会员，为胜利粉碎蒋伪进攻，保卫好时光而斗争。
