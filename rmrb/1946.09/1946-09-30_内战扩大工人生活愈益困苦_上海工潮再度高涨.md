Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: Shanghai News: Labor strikes here have begun to rise again. From late August to the 17th of this month, strikes have occurred successively at the Huacheng Canvas Factory, Changfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Guangzhong Machinery Dyeing Factory, the Southern Goods Industry, the French-owned Tram Company, the American-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company, the Commercial Press, the Bathhouse Industry, the Civil Aviation Industry, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, the Racecourse Association, the Sino-American Tobacco Factory, and the Sullivan Candy Factory. On the 17th alone, six strikes erupted in one day at the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, the Defu Foreign Firm and Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, the National Second Machine Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Fourth Textile Factory of the China Textile Company, and the Yilin Food Company. The causes of the strikes are mostly demands for higher wages and improved treatment, and some are direct opposition to the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek government. The large-scale strikes included the August 31st strike of over 30,000 workers from over 1,000 Southern Goods businesses, the September 2nd strike of all tram and trolleybus workers of the French-owned Tram Company, and the September 7th petition of over a thousand workers from bathhouses and other industries. The strike of the French-owned Tram Company workers was particularly shocking to the city. The cause of this strike was the unreasonable beating and injury of the company's ticket seller, Liang Guanghui, by naval soldiers. During the strike, Kuomintang plainclothes special agents continued to beat the company's workers, with two incidents occurring on the day of the strike. The Police Bureau's Garrison Department and the Social Bureau ordered the workers to resume work, but all the workers insisted on resisting. The wives and children of the beaten workers lay across the tracks to prevent the trams from leaving the factory. The authorities were forced to accept the workers' demands to punish the culprits, discipline them, the factory paid medical expenses, and apologized to the workers, leading to a victorious resolution of the strike. Under the impetus of the labor strikes, employees of various railways in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Shanghai are also actively planning to petition in Nanjing. Note: Since the Japanese surrender, labor strikes in Shanghai have been continuous. In May and June of this year, they reached their peak, affecting almost all industries in Shanghai. However, since July, they had declined due to the suppression by the Kuomintang authorities. Later, due to the expansion of the civil war and the increasingly difficult lives of the workers, they broke through the authorities' oppression and resurfaced in late August.

　　内战扩大工人生活愈益困苦
　  上海工潮再度高涨
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：此间工潮开始再度高涨，从八月下旬起至本月十七日，先后发生华成帆布厂、长丰染织厂、光中机染厂、南货业、法商电车、美商亚细亚煤油公司、商务印书馆、浴室业、民航业、染织业、跑马总会、中美烟厂、沙利文糖果厂等工潮；十七日一天中，更发生法商水电、敌伪产业管理局所接收的德孚洋行与拜耳药厂、经济部全国第二机器厂、中纺公司第四纺织厂、怡林食品公司等工潮六起。工潮起因大多数为要求提高工资，改善待遇，并有直接反对蒋介石政府的压迫者。八月三十一日的一千余家南货业三万职工的大罢工，九月二日的法商电车公司全部有轨无轨电车工人的罢工，及七日的浴室等职工千余人的请愿为工潮中之规模最大者。法商电车工人的罢工，更为震撼全市。这一工潮的起因系由于该公司售票员梁光辉被海军士兵无理殴辱受伤，在罢工中国民党便衣特务仍继续殴打该公司职工，在罢工当日就发生两起。警察局警备部社会局曾勒令工人复工，但全体职工仍坚持抗争，被殴工人的妻儿横卧车轨阻止电车出厂，当局不得已接受工人要求应允惩凶管束，厂方支付医药费并向工人道歉，工潮胜利解决。在工潮激荡下，在沪的全国民党区各铁路的员工亦积极酝酿赴南京请愿。按：自日本投降以来，上海工潮连续不断，今年五、六月间曾发展至最高峰，沪市各业几乎全被波及，但自七月起，由于国民党当局的镇压曾一度低落，后因内战扩大，工人生活愈益困苦，乃于八月下旬起突破当局的压迫重新抬头。
