　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County on the 4th] Autumn harvest is imminent in various parts of southern Hebei. Mutual aid teams and groups in various villages are enthusiastically discussing plans for a village-wide labor exchange for the autumn harvest. This year, the cultivated land area in Jiudian, Guangzong, has more than doubled compared to last year, increasing from 22 qing to 43.82 qing. Last month, due to excessive rainfall, three qing of cotton, millet, and sorghum were flooded. Despite the losses from the flooding, the village estimates a harvest of 75,000 jin of cotton (calculated at 50 jin per mu), 71,300 jin of millet, and 22,000 jin of sorghum (calculated at 70 jin per mu). With the millet and sorghum nearing ripeness and cotton blossoming, the mutual aid teams have formulated detailed plans to mobilize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers for a concentrated autumn harvest. Starting from the fifth day of the eighth lunar month, they aim to complete the harvest within half a month, leaving only the cotton. Regarding the use of male and female labor, the mutual aid teams plan to implement a major labor exchange for harvesting crops. Because crop quality varies, work will be calculated based on yield, with 70 jin of grain counting as one work-day. Compensation will be determined based on the strength, skill, speed, and quality of work, with final accounts and profit distribution after the autumn harvest. During the harvest period, picking cotton will be the responsibility of women and children, with 50 jin of cotton counting as one work-day. Grinding grain and cooking meals are major tasks. It has been decided that grinding will be done manually instead of using animal power, undertaken by all the women, with three women grinding 27 jin of grain (wheat or sorghum) to earn one work-day. During busy times, meals will be prepared collectively, with ten people forming a group, and one person cooking three meals for the group earning one work-day. Each mutual aid group will assign one person to cut green grass to feed the livestock, earning one work-day per day.
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi on the 4th] This summer, except for the four counties of Yuanshi and Zanhuang in western Hebei, most areas of Taihang have experienced favorable weather, promising a bumper harvest. Early rice and millet, early corn, and other crops are gradually ripening, with plump ears. Farmers in various places are delighted. If another timely rain is received before the harvest, all counties in Shanxi can expect a full harvest. However, a few villages in Zuoquan, Heshun, and Lingchuan counties have suffered hailstorms. In Zuoquan's Lianbi Village, hailstorms on July 30th destroyed about one-third of the crops. Heshun's Niuchuan and Boli and 17 other villages experienced more severe hailstorms. According to statistics from nine of these villages, approximately 8,000 mu of crops were destroyed. In Lingchuan's Manliu and ten other villages, hailstorms occurred on the 8th of this month. The most severely affected village, Longwangjia, is estimated to have only 30% of its crops harvestable, while others may have 50%. County governments in Zuoquan and other counties have dispatched personnel to the hailstorm-affected areas to investigate, stabilize the morale of the affected masses, organize sideline production, and carry out self-salvation efforts. Lianbi Village has formulated four measures for overcoming the disaster through thrift and production: 1. Plant more autumn vegetables and wheat. 2. Eat more vegetables and conserve grain. 3. Engage in more sideline production such as firewood collection and transportation. 4. The county cooperative will provide loans to develop women's textile production on a large scale. Due to continuous rain in Lin County, 33 villages in the low-lying plains of the tenth district have suffered waterlogging, resulting in no harvest for over 8,000 mu and only a 50% harvest for over 6,000 mu. The county government has also dispatched personnel to organize production and self-salvation efforts. Furthermore, a large swarm of locusts has suddenly appeared in the Mofang Village area of Gaoyi, affecting an area of approximately ten square li. The local government has organized the masses to catch and kill the locusts in Fangzha, Pota, and other villages. Xi Fengzhou, Director of the Xingtai Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and technician Li Shoufeng have rushed to provide guidance.

    【本报威县四日电】冀南各地秋收在即，各村互助队、互助组，正热烈讨论实行全村大变工的秋收计划。广宗旧店今年耕地面积比去年超过一倍，由二十二顷增至四十三顷八十二亩。上月由于雨水过大，被水淹没棉花、谷子、高粱三顷，除水灾损失外，全村估计可收棉七万五千斤（每亩以五十斤计算）谷子七万一千三百斤，高粱两万二千斤（每亩以七十斤计算）现在谷子高粱眼看就熟，棉亦见花，互助联队已定出详细计划：把全劳力及半劳力都组织起来突击秋收，从阴历八月初五开始，半月内即完成，只剩下棉花。在男女劳力使用上，互助联队的计划是收割庄稼实行大变工，因庄稼好坏不同，用工以收成计算，收七十斤粮算一个工。根据人力强弱，干活高低快慢而定，秋收完了算账分红。收秋期内摘花全由妇女儿童担任。摘花五十斤算一个工。杂活上碾磨做饭是一件大事，决定碾磨以人力代畜力，由全体妇女担任，三人一股，磨二十七斤粮（以麦高粱为准）顶一个工，忙时伙吃饭，十个人为一组，一个人给一组做三顿饭算一个工。每个互助组抽一个人割青草喂牲口，一天顶一个工。
