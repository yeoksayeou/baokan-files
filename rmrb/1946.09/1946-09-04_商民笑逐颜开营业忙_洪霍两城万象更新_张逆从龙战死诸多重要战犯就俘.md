　　Merchants Smile and Bustle with Business;
    Hongdong and Huoxian Cities Show a New Look
    Traitor Zhang Conglong Dies in Battle, Many Important War Criminals Captured

    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 2nd dispatch] After the liberation of Huoxian City, seventy or eighty stores have already resumed business. Huoxian was originally a relatively prosperous city on the Tongpu Railway, but Mr. Qiao Ziyu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, told reporters: "After the Japanese left, Yan's army entered the city and lived with the puppet army. From that time on, merchants had no freedom. They were not allowed to go more than twenty miles away to purchase goods. Each store had a five-household joint guarantee, and they had to do construction work every day. The levies were also terrible. The cost of wood for repairing fortifications by Yan's puppet army alone amounted to four million yuan in two months, and recently another 400,000 yuan was levied for training class expenses. If the Eighth Route Army had not come, all the stores would have been ready to close." The first and second senior elementary schools in the city have already resumed classes, with a total of more than 800 teachers and students. The streets have been thoroughly cleaned, and the city appearance is very tidy. Groups of men, women, and children walk happily on the streets. The old manager of a Chinese and Western pharmacy said with a smile: "This is the first time in nine years that children have been jumping and playing on the streets!" All four barber shops have boiled tea, and they expressed a very warm welcome to the commanders and fighters of the Eighth Route Army to come and get haircuts.
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 31st dispatch] Hongdong City, two weeks after liberation, presents a completely new look after sweeping away fascist tyranny. The democratic government has explicitly announced the abolition of all exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by Yan's puppet regime, such as "credit purchases," "county purchases," "agency purchases," "military purchases," and "miscellaneous fees." Seventy-three ordinary people who could not pay the "credit purchases" and other grains and were falsely accused by Yan's army of "resisting grain and colluding with the Eighth Route Army," and who suffered all kinds of torture in prison, were given special comfort and released. Starving people wandering the streets have received relief. Of the 205 stores in the city, 163 have resumed business. This is completely different from last year when Yan's army entered the city and the stores were unable to open for two months, all business premises were occupied, and shop assistants were arrested to do labor. The large-scale village consolidation, which served as the foundation for the feudal rule of Yan's puppet regime, has been destroyed. The original five main streets in the city were divided into two consolidated villages by Yan's puppet regime. Now, street public offices have been restored, and the masses have elected temporary street heads. The thirty-five neighborhoods are now electing neighborhood representatives in preparation for the popular election of street heads. In the villages on the outskirts of the city, such as Jia Village and Podi, the consolidated villages have been changed to village public offices through popular election. The four elementary schools in the city have resumed classes, and the democratic government is working to solve the textbook difficulties.
    [Our Newspaper Yangcheng, 2nd dispatch] In the recent Hongdong self-defense battle, Zhang Conglong, the traitorous puppet county magistrate of Hongdong who had surrendered to the enemy for many years and harmed the local area, died in the city. Seventeen other local major war criminals, as well as more than 100 traitors, local tyrants, and secret agents from the four townships of Anze, Linfen, and Zhaocheng who had fled into the city, were also captured by our army and civilians. Among them were Meng Qinren, the puppet police chief of Hongdong; Liu Duqiong, the deputy head of the puppet Struggle Corps; Zhang Keming, the chief of the puppet police station; Cui Lianzhong, a patrol officer; Dong Yaoguang, the section chief of the puppet county government's first section and a henchman of Zhang Conglong; Han Chengguo, the head of the puppet army慰劳 group; Ren Gutang, the deputy head; Liu Dekui, the head of the "Special District Progress Society" among the secret service leaders; Mi Dadong, the head of the "Hongdong People's Progress Society"; Wang Zhengguo, the deputy director; Cao Jianbang, the secretary, etc. For days, the masses from various places have gathered at the gate of the court, requesting that these traitors be taken back and democratically punished by the broad masses. The government has approved the masses to settle their crimes and then hand them over to the government for legal action. In addition, a large number of puppet troops, military police, and other puppet personnel who were coerced by the enemy and puppets have been given the opportunity to repent and start anew, and the government will not hold them accountable for their past actions. Under the inspiration of our lenient policy, 360 people, including Huang Fengqi, Liu Peiwei, and Wang Jialu, have automatically confessed. They have vowed not to work for the puppet army again.
