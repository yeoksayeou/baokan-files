　　The Kuomintang Rear Area of Nantong

            Seventy-Two Pillboxes
    If you walk on the streets of Nantong, you will be surrounded by Kuomintang soldiers. Some say that if you take any point as the center and draw a circle with a radius of 25 meters, you will enclose 30 to 40 soldiers. There are seventy-two tall pillboxes around Nantong, which is less than five li in circumference. When the 105th Division was ordered to complete these fortifications within half a month, the soldiers, like devils, destroyed houses, temples, ancestral halls, and public institutions everywhere, and even larger residential walls were demolished, followed by forced conscription. The soldiers went to find masons all over the city, but were greatly disappointed, as they had already fled at the first sign of trouble.
    A notice for purchasing fodder was posted on Ganzheng Bridge. At West Park, groups of horses drooped their tails listlessly, and horse manure piled up in the city moat. As time passed, the manure was full of wriggling maggots. Old people shook their heads and sighed, "The peaceful era when Chongchuan (old name of Nantong) has never had soldiers and horses" is gone forever.
            Leave After Capturing Dongtai
    The houses in Nantong, originally worth an ounce of gold for an inch of floorboard, were swamped by the arrival of the 102nd, 105th, and 49th Divisions of the 26th Army, which brought with them countless colorful battalion and company commander's wives. They, with their guards carrying submachine guns, ran to the homes of ordinary people. As soon as they saw a room with a bed, they immediately wrote on it with chalk: "Occupied by ×× Battalion Commander." Within two hours, a large contingent of troops arrived and occupied it unconditionally. One family on South Street, when the mistress of the house returned in the evening, thought some relatives had come. When she went inside, she found it was the battalion commander's wife. She surprisingly negotiated with them, and the battalion commander, holding a gun, said, "Can't we just borrow it for a while? We will leave after capturing Dongtai."
    Now is the era of turning guest into host. The people are "guests," and the corrupt officials and barbaric soldiers are "hosts." Many families, grandmothers, daughters-in-law, sons, and fathers, are squeezed into one room, while the battalion commander's wife occupies two large wing rooms. People have no choice but to sarcastically ask them, "When will Dongtai be captured?"
            Ten-Household Joint Guarantee
    Every ten steps on the main streets and alleys, there is a person standing there with a red strip on their body. This is a Baojia post. Each household must send someone to guard every day. If the son goes out to do business, even the old woman with bound feet has to stand guard. In the middle of the night, special agents and military police often break into people's homes under the pretext of "suppressing bandits," ransacking chests and cabinets. People dig cellars in their homes to hide their valuables. The Baojia system here is unprecedented. Anyone leaving the city must obtain an exit permit. As long as the authorities want to see you, even if you are far away in Taiwan or the United States, you must return within a limited time, fearing that you have gone to the "bandit area." Otherwise, nine other households will suffer and be jointly prosecuted. This is clearly stipulated and posted in every household. In addition, all middle school students must have a ten-person joint guarantee. If one has "ideological problems," the other nine will also "enjoy" the same punishment.
            Even Old Women Must Fire a Shot
    On June 15th, the 49th Division blew its bugles and attacked Rugao.
    When they advanced to the edge of Rugao City without any resistance for a day and a night, Division Commander Wang Tiehan panicked. Rugao was an empty city. He knew that the New Fourth Army would not let him off so easily. Just as he was about to lead his troops back, ambushes from all sides began. The 49th Division was cut into several sections and encountered nineteen major encirclements. Six thousand people laid down their arms, and a division's worth of American military equipment was given to the New Fourth Army like a gift.
    The Central Army soldiers are suffering, with wounded soldiers being transported back along every street and alley. When doctors applied medicine to them, they complained, "What are we fighting for? We can't win any battles. We might as well go over (surrender) as soon as possible." They talked about the bravery of the New Fourth Army. One old soldier said, "When I was taking my gun off the firing line, an old woman by the roadside also shot me." He injured his left arm. He shook his head and continued, "There's nothing we can do. Even old women are the New Fourth Army."
    The Central Army's life is too hard. They eat black bread from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and two ounces of smelly pickles. When they go to the front line, the officers force them to fight. Many soldiers are influenced by the New Fourth Army's propaganda and often easily lay down their guns. They often agree to surrender together and never come back.
            21st Army's Broken Guns
    After the 49th Division was defeated by the New Fourth Army, the 21st Army arrived. Broken guns and rotten cannons looked like defeated soldiers. When they arrived, people commented, "The Central Army is failing. Why are all the guns broken?" The children in the city began to mock the soldiers, making up a rhyme: "Broken foreign guns, can't fire, meet the New Fourth Army, drop the gun and surrender." The soldiers were dispirited, and their confidence gradually diminished. Only the officers were still saying, "The Americans support us, and big guns and cannons will arrive soon."
    These two days, it is said that large ships loaded with many trucks and ammunition arrived at Tianshenggang and are being transported north in a steady stream, but the soldiers cannot muster any energy.
            Hoping for the Central Government, the People Suffer
    In the shop windows on South Street and West Street, the Three People's Principles Youth League and the division's political department displayed many picture posters and propaganda paintings, the most common being "Hoping for the Central Government," depicting many heads waiting for the arrival of the "Old Central Government."
    However, the people hate the Old Central Government to the bone. Their homes are turned upside down, and countless families' children flee to other villages, causing family separation. Taxes are heavy, life is difficult, and shops have gradually closed down since July. People are frightened day and night, and soldiers hold guns and beat people. People sigh in disappointment, "If the fighting continues, we will die!"
    Hoping for the Central Government, what has the Central Government brought?
    The Communist Party's policies are spreading among the broad masses of the people. Many people say, "It would be better if the Communist Party came. Life would be better, everyone would work and eat, neither rich nor poor, what a good life!"
    The people's anti-war sentiment is rising day by day.

　　蒋军后方的南通
　　胡径文
            七十二个碉堡
    你假使在南通的街上走，摩肩接踵前后左右都是蒋兵。有人说随便拿任何一点做圆心，以二十五米作半径而画一个圆圈，都会圈住三四十个军人的。南通周围不到五里，有七十二个高大的碉堡。当一○五师要在半月内完成这些堡垒的时候，大兵们象鬼子一样到处拆毁房屋庙宇祠堂公共机关，结果连大些的住宅围墙也给捣毁了，接着四处拉夫。大兵们按址去找全城的泥水匠，可是失望得很，他们早就闻风远走了。
    干政桥上贴了收买马料的布告，在西公园成群成群的马，无精打彩的垂着尾巴，马粪堆满了城河，日子久了，粪上全是小蛆蠕动。老年人摇头叹息：“崇川（南通旧称）自古无兵马”的太平盛世是不再有了。
            打下东台就走
    南通的房子，原为一寸地板一寸金的，当二十六军一○二师、一○五师、四十九师象潮水一样来到的时候，同时带来了多少花花绿绿的营长、连长太太，她们带着卫兵背着冲锋枪跑到老百姓的家里去，只要看见房间里有一只床的，马上用粉笔在上面写了：“××营长住”，两个钟头，大队人马开到，无条件的占据了。南大街有一家，当女主人晚上回来时，当是什么亲戚来了，进去一看，原来是营长太太，她惊奇地向他们交涉，营长握着枪说：“暂时借住一下不可以吗，我们打下了东台就走。”
    现在是反主为宾的时代，老百姓是“宾”，贪官蛮军是“主”，许多人家婆婆媳妇儿子父亲挤在一间房子里，而营长太太却占据二个大厢房，人们没有办法，常常讽刺的问他们：“东台几时才能打下呀？”
            十家联保具结
    大街小巷不到十步就有一个人站在那里，身上贴着红条子，这是保甲岗位。每个住户每天决定要派人站岗的，儿子出去做生意了，老婆婆挺着小脚也得要站。深更半夜，特务军警常常闯人民家借口“剿匪”，翻箱倒笼，人民都在房里挖下地窟，把好的东西藏在里面。这里的保甲制度是旷古未闻的，凡是离开本城的要领出城证，只要当局要看到你的时候，你虽远在台湾和美国，也要限期回来，怕你去了“匪区”，否则就九家倒霉，同吃官司，这是明文规定贴在每个老百姓家里的。另外凡是中学生，要十人联保，一有“思想问题”，其余九人也要“享受”同等罪名。
            老太婆也要打一枪
    六月十五日，四十九师吹着军号进攻如皋了。
    当他们一天一夜毫无阻碍的推进到如皋城边的时候，师长王铁汉心慌了，如皋是个空城。他知道新四军不会这样便宜他的，正待领兵回去时，四面的伏击开始了，四十九师被切成数段，遭遇了十九个大包围，六千人放下武器，一个师的美国军械像礼物一样的送给了新四军。
    中央兵是苦的，满街满巷运回来伤兵，当医师给他们敷药的时候，他们埋怨着“打啥子，打仗又打不胜，还不如过去（投降）为快”。他们讲着新四军的神勇。有一个老年兵说：“当我拿着枪从火线上退下来的时候，路旁的一个老太婆也打了我一枪。”他伤了左臂，他摇摇头继续说：“没有办法，连老太婆也是新四军。”
    中央军的生活太苦了，吃的联总救济的黑面包，二两臭咸菜，上前线，长官压着打，多少兵都受新四军的宣传，往往是很轻易的放下枪来，他们常常约好了要降要一齐降，去了就不再回来。
            二十一军破枪杆
    当四十九师被新四军打垮以后，二十一军又来了。破枪烂炮象败军一样，来了人们都议论着：“中央军不行了，怎么都是坏枪呢？”城里的小孩子开始对那些士兵们嘲笑了，他们编了一首歌谣：“破洋枪，打不响，碰到新四军，丢枪去投降。”兵士们没精打彩的，他们的信心日渐减消了，只是长官们还在讲“美国人支持我们，大枪大炮马上就到。”
    这两天据说天生港大船装来不少卡车和弹药，并且源源的向北运输，但是兵士们打不起精神。
            望中央、民遭殃
    在南大街西大街的商店橱窗里，三民主义青年团和师政治部画了很多画报宣传画，最多的是“望中央”，画了多少人头在等待着“老中央”到来。
    然而人民却对老中央恨之入骨，房子给弄得鸡犬不宁，无数人家的孩子逃亡外乡，弄得骨肉分离，捐税深重生活困难，七月份起，商店渐渐倒闭了，人民日夜惊惶，兵士持枪打人，人们失望的叹着气：“再打下去要死了！”
    望中央，中央给带来了什么？
    广大的人民之间流传着共产党的政策，许多人说：“索性共产党来了，生活也好过了，大家做做吃吃不贫不富，多好的日子呢！”
    人民反战的情绪是日日在高起来了。
