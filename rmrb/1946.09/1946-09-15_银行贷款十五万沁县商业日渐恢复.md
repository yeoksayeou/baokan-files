　　【This dispatch from Yangcheng, 11th】 According to the person in charge of the Taiyue Administrative Office's Qin County慰问团慰问团(comfort delegation) stated: "We conducted慰问慰问(comfort visits) in Qin County town, as well as Gu Yi, Jiaokou, Niu Temple, and other locations. These areas were once occupied by the puppet army of the traitor Duan Bingchang, and the people's wealth was plundered by Duan. Qin County, once known as the rice and grain distribution center of eastern Shanxi, had become a dark marketplace. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the city, the democratic government immediately abolished all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. The Jinnan Bank also provided a loan of 150,000 yuan to support commerce in the city. Within a month, 148 stores had reopened in the city, all but 18 of which were publicly owned, the rest being privately funded. Business was particularly brisk before the Mid-Autumn Festival, with daily transactions totaling more than 1.5 million yuan. Publicly owned stores are using large quantities of daily necessities for farmers, such as cotton, cloth, grain, and salt, to regulate the market. Prices have fallen by 75%, and people's lives are gradually stabilizing as they engage in various production and construction activities."

　　银行贷款十五万沁县商业日渐恢复
    【本报阳城十一日电】据太岳行署沁县慰问团负责人谈：“我们曾在沁县城关及固亦、交口、牛寺等地进行慰问，以上地区，曾为伪军段逆炳昌所盘据，人民财富被段逆掠夺殆尽，素称晋东米粮集散地的沁县城，已成黑暗街市。八路军解放该城后，民主政府立即废除各项苛捐杂税，冀南银行并贷款十五万元，扶植城内商业，一个月中，城内商店恢复一百四十八家，除其中十八座公营商店外，余均私人集资开设者。中秋节前，生意特别兴隆，每日交易总额达一百五十余万元。公营商店以大批的农民日用品，如棉花、布匹、粮食、食盐调剂市场，物价下降百分之七十五，人民生活渐趋安定，正从事各种生产建设”。
