　　[This newspaper, Yangcheng, 11th dispatch] In the course of studying current events on the anti-civil war, the masses in Taiyue have profoundly recognized the nature of Chiang Kai-shek. They are determined to spare no sacrifice to defend their fruits of liberation and fight the reactionaries to the end. Han Shaowen from Zhengjiawan, Fushan, said, "Chiang Kai-shek is even more treacherous than Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei!" Ge Jingmei, a woman from Zhao Jiawan, said: "Chiang Kai-shek, who has lost his conscience, if you don't want the common people to be liberated, if you want the heart and liver of the common people, the common people will want your entrails!" Xigou Village in the Sixth District of Qinyuan held a current affairs discussion meeting, which the masses called the "Hatred-of-Stubborn-Enemies Meeting." More than 140 people at the meeting all signed up to join the militia. At the current affairs forum in Chengbi Village, Fourth District of Qinyuan, Zhang Shiming, an active young person, said: "In order to defend our fruits, we must go to the front!" Twelve people immediately signed up to go to the front. At the current affairs forum held in Xindianshang Village, Fourth District, Shi Mingshan said: "The Communist Party led us to reduce rent and interest and we were liberated. If it hadn't been for the Central Army's attack, wouldn't we still be living a peaceful life!" Kong Xixian, who was over forty years old, said: "Anyway, we can't live a good life because of Lao Jiang. It's like one Japan left and another America came!" Liu San then said: "Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei are exactly the same, as if they were born from the same mother." Kong Xizhong said: "This bad guy Chiang Kai-shek is just like a willow cart, he won't move unless you hit him. If the Pinghan Line and Baijin Line hadn't fought well last year, could the war have stopped?" After the Sixth District teachers finished the teachers' research class, they organized a propaganda team of 32 people, who went to the border areas of Pingyao and Jiexiu to conduct propaganda. Liu Jishun, the leader of the group, said: "Defending the fruits of liberation is just 'doing it'! Each of us in the group will make five stone mines to give to the stubborn army as gifts."
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 11th dispatch] The people's guerrillas who went deep into the Chiang army's occupied areas actively operated to coordinate with the frontal Eighth Route Army's self-defense operations. The Chiang army, which once again "suppressed" our Zhongtiao Mountain area, suffered a serious blow and was forced to flee westward in separate directions. On September 1st, the Chiang army once again combined with local traitors and bullies to "suppress" the Wen and Xia mountainous areas (Zhongtiao Mountains). The Eighth Route Army held its ground and fought bravely with the invading army. The people's guerrillas who went deep into the Chiang army's occupied areas also cooperated effectively. On the 4th, in Guoli Village, twenty miles northwest of Xia County, they ambushed a unit of thirty-six Chiang soldiers, annihilating all but one who escaped. Six Chiang officers, including a company commander, were killed, twenty-nine were captured alive, and one light machine gun, twenty-seven rifles, one pistol, and more than seventy rounds of ammunition were seized. The Chiang army's rear was threatened by this, so it fled west in a panic that same night, encountering counterattacks from our guerrillas along the way. The soldiers had no fighting spirit and were extremely panic-stricken. It is now reported that the Wen and Xia mountainous areas have been completely recovered by us. The Taiyue Military Region, upon hearing the news, sent a telegram of commendation, praising it as a model of patriotic self-defense guerrilla warfare, and called on the entire region's troops to learn from it, and to carry out this kind of clean and thorough annihilation warfare, giving the invading Chiang army one annihilating blow after another.
