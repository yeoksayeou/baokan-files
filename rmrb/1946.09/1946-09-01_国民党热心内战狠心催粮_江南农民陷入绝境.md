　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Due to the Kuomintang authorities' requisition of military grain, farmers in Jiangnan are still in a state of starvation and despair after the wheat harvest. A letter to the editor published in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on the 1st, from a village teacher, stated: "The more intense the civil war, the more ruthlessly grain is being urged, and the farmers' spirits are becoming abnormal." He personally witnessed a farmer pushing his wife into the river for no reason, and later died himself. He also saw an old farmer smashing his waterwheel into the river, and then picking it up again a moment later. Another farmer from Wujiang County wrote to the same newspaper saying: "The first batch of military grain has been cleared, and the second batch of military grain is being 'purchased' again. These days, the district offices' self-defense forces have almost entirely mobilized to implement the seizure of rice. As soon as they arrive in the countryside, they take all the stored rice from the farmers' homes, regardless of the circumstances."
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 25th: Recently, in areas such as Changchun, Shenyang, and Jilin, Chiang's troops have been urgently conscripting grain and recruits. In Changchun alone, 10,000 bags of military grain have been forcibly requisitioned, while Jilin and other places have requisitioned 16,000 bags. Chiang's troops have once again implemented the tyrannical policies of the puppet Manchukuo in their controlled areas, requiring all males over the age of sixteen to be forcibly conscripted into the army. The required number has now been met, and young people in various places are fleeing, families are separated, and the situation is extremely tragic.

　　国民党热心内战狠心催粮
    江南农民陷入绝境
    【新华社延安二十七日电】由于国民党当局征收军粮，江南农民在麦收后仍陷于饥饿绝境。沪文汇报一日登载一乡村教员投书中称：内战愈打得紧，粮也愈催得凶，农民们精神反常了。他亲眼看见一个农民无故地把他的老婆推到河里，后来自己也死了。他还看见一个年老的农民把他的水车摔到河中，过一会又自己拾起来。另一吴江县的农民投书该报说：“第一批军粮解清了，第二批军粮又在“征购”了，这几天各区公所自卫队几乎全体动员实行倒米了，他们一到乡间，就不问青红皂白把农民们家中所存的食米照单全收。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十五日电】近来长春、沈阳、吉林等地，蒋军紧急征粮征丁，仅长春一地即强征军粮一万包，吉林等地则为一万六千包，蒋军在其统治区内复又实行伪满暴政，凡十六岁以上之男子均须强征入伍，现已征足数目，各地青壮年纷纷逃亡，父子离散，情景至惨。
