Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: According to delayed news from New York: According to the "Workers Daily" on the 9th, the New York Committee for Peace and the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy have decided to designate the 22nd to the 28th of this month as "Withdraw from China Week." Peace groups will hold similar actions in 35 major cities across the United States as a prelude to the China Far East Conference to be held in San Francisco from October 18th to 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Shanghai News: The news that American democrats launched "Withdraw from China Week" immediately aroused close attention from the public opinion in Shanghai. The "United Evening News" published an editorial on the 11th, praising this move as "a true expression of the American people's desire for peace." The "Wenhui Daily" also published an editorial the day after publishing the news (the 12th), using it to encourage the Chinese people. The editorial pointed out that no illusions should be held about today's rulers in the United States, and that Marshall's travels between Nanjing and Lushan were merely decorations in the war. The editorial pointed out that in order to achieve peace, the Chinese people should actively exert their own strength. The "Withdraw from China Week" movement launched by the American people is a manifestation of the American people's strength. In addition, "Wenhui Daily" readers wrote letters to the newspaper, responding to the call for "Withdraw from China Week."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: New York News: American writer and former correspondent in the Soviet Union, Snow, delivered a speech at the Far Eastern Policy Committee on the 12th, advocating that three-power arbitration should replace the current U.S. mediation of the Chinese civil war. He declared that if Chiang Kai-shek refused to accept the participation of the Soviet Union and Britain, the United Nations should declare a trade and financial blockade against China. Snow also criticized the U.S. aid to the Chinese government policy. He also pointed out that without foreign aid, it would be impossible for Chiang Kai-shek to eliminate the opposition party by force. He also said that the Communist Party has legitimate reasons to protect themselves and resist the dying government under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership.

　　美国三十五个城市举行
　　“退出中国周”运动
　　史诺主张三巨头仲裁中国问题
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据纽约迟到消息：据工人日报九日载：纽约争取和平委员会及民主远东政策委员会，顷定本月二十二日至二十八日为“退出中国周”，争取和平之各集团，在全美三十五个主要城市将举行同样行动，以为十月十八至二十日在旧金山召开之中国远东会议之前奏。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：美国民主人士发起“退出中国周”一讯传抵上海后，立即引起舆论界密切关注。联合晚报十一日发表社论，赞扬此举为“美国人民要求和平的真正意志的表现”。文汇报亦于刊布此消息的翌日（十二日），于社论中引以鼓舞中国人民。该社论指出对美国今天的当权者，不能抱任何幻想，马歇尔来往京庐间，只是战争中的点缀而已。该社论指出：要求得和平，中国人民应当积极发挥自己的力量，美国人民发动的“退出中国周”运动，即是美国人民表现的力量。此外，并有文汇报读者投书该报，响应“退出中国周”的号召。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】纽约讯：美名作家及前驻苏记者史诺，十二日在远东政策委员会演说，主张以三巨头仲裁来代替目前由美国一国之调解中国内战事件。他宣称：如蒋介石拒绝接受苏、英参加，联合国应对中国宣布实行贸易与财政的封锁。史诺又批评美国援助中国政府政策。他又指出蒋介石如无外援，欲以武力消灭反对党，全属不可能之事。又称：共产党有正当的理由保障他们自身，反抗蒋介石领导下之垂危的政府。
