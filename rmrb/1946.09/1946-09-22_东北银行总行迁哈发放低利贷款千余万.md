Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th: The Northeast Bank headquarters has moved to Harbin and opened for business on the 2nd. In order to support private enterprises, the bank issued 12 million yuan in low-interest loans, which were re-lent at a monthly interest rate of 1.2% to industrial and commercial owners and those in urgent need of funds through three private banks: Harbin Bank, Yifa Bank, and Gongcheng Bank. The market fluctuations in Harbin caused by the Kuomintang authorities' discontinuation of the 100-yuan Red Army note have gradually stabilized due to the state-owned trading company's low-priced sales of daily necessities and the issuance of loans.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th: The various organs in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region have achieved preliminary results in rectifying production and reducing the burden on the people. The directly affiliated units of the Border Region government have reorganized fourteen production groups to engage in wool weaving, shoe sole making, and participation in construction projects. The various mass organizations in the Border Region have specifically set aside two hours in the afternoon as production time to participate in wool weaving production, with the highest daily income reaching over 1,600 yuan.
