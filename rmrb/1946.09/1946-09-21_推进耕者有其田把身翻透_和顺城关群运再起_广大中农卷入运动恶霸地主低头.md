　　【This dispatch from our Changzhi office, dated 17th】 Assisted by the work teams for emancipation, the mass movement in Chengguan, Heshun County, has reignited, with a scale three times larger than that before the wheat harvest this year. The majority of middle peasants and honest farmers have been drawn into the movement. Most bully landlords have truly yielded to the peasants only after this movement, and the masses have genuinely achieved emancipation. The work teams for emancipation arrived in Chengguan, Heshun County, on the 8th of last month and immediately cooperated with district and village cadres to inspect the mass movement of the first half of the year. They found that the emancipation of the masses was not thorough enough. For example, Li Genbao in Dongguan was still subjected to the cruel oppression of the landlord, with his entire family sharing a single tattered quilt. In Nanguan, the farmer Bu Fushan and his daughter-in-law shared a single piece of clothing. A small number of landlords in Dongguan still occupied 22% of the village's land, most of which was high-quality land, and many poor peasants still lacked arable land and suffered from heavy rent exploitation. The masses in Nanguan reflected: "We have only been half-emancipated." The inspection revealed that the reasons were: the release of control was insufficient; due to consideration for the landlords, the landlords adopted delaying tactics after the liquidation, and the peasants did not obtain the fruits of victory. For example, the landlord Li Guangcheng in Dongguan was supposed to compensate the farmer Zhang Chengjian with five *shi* of grain, but he only gave one. Secondly, the distribution of fruits was improper, which led to disunity among the peasants. The leadership regarded many honest farmers as backward elements and neglected their ideological mobilization. After the inspection, the village cadres first conducted a self-criticism to unify their understanding and break down the complacency of some cadres. Then, the slogan of "Land to the Tiller" was promoted among the masses, and the slogan "Thorough Emancipation" was put forward. Combined with the current events education of opposing the civil war and defending the fruits of emancipation, the masses' worries about "the changing of the sky" were dispelled, and their courage and determination to fight again were inspired. Huo Erheshang in Dongguan, an honest farmer who had not been mobilized in the first half of the year, also confronted the landlord this time to reason with him. In mid-last month, a general liquidation against the landlords was launched in the entire Chengguan. In the process of reasoning and accounting, the bullies and local tyrants tried every means to stubbornly resist, but they were unable to justify themselves and had to bow their heads to the masses and return their possessions. In this general liquidation struggle, the unity of the broad middle peasants greatly increased the strength of the movement. During the movement, the leadership conducted a "military consolidation movement," which further broke the wait-and-see attitude of the middle peasants and united the broad masses of middle peasants. For example, in the first half of the year, only 70 people participated in each struggle in Dongguan, but now it has reached more than 200, and the number of activists has also greatly increased. Preliminary statistics show that after the landlords and bullies in the entire Chengguan lowered their heads, the property they compensated to the masses included: more than 6,400 silver dollars, 160 taels of silver, more than 120,000 *Ji* currency, 15 head of livestock, more than 100 sheep, and 46 *shi* of grain, which were then rationally distributed. In the distribution, class education was firmly grasped. The masses' awareness was raised, and many peasants burst into tears when they thought of the past while looking at the things returned by the landlords. The masses in Dongguan voluntarily contributed 130,000 *yuan* to help poor people in other villages achieve emancipation.

　　推进耕者有其田把身翻透
    和顺城关群运再起
    广大中农卷入运动恶霸地主低头
    【本报长治十七日电】在翻身队帮助下，和顺城关群运再起，规模较今年麦收前大至三倍以上，大部中农与老实农民均卷入运动。大部恶霸、地主经此次运动始真正向农民低头，群众始真正获得翻身。翻身队系于上月八日到达和顺城关，当即配合区、村干部进行对前半年群运的检查，发现群众翻身不够彻底，如东关李艮保，仍受着地主的残酷压榨，全家人伙盖着一条破被，南关农民卜福善婆媳俩伙穿一件衣裳，东关少数地主的土地仍占全村土地百分之二十二，且大部系上等地，贫农仍多缺少耕地而受重租剥削。南关群众则反映：“只翻了半个身”。检查原因为：过去放手不够，由于照顾地主，致清算后地主采取拖延办法，农民并未获得果实，如东关地主李广成对农民张成艰应赔偿五石粮食，实际只拿出一石。其次是果实分配欠妥，致使农民内部不团结，领导上对许多老实农民认为是落后分子，而忽视对他们的思想发动等。检查后，首先在村干部中进行了检讨，统一了认识，打破了一些干部的自满情绪，接着在群众中宣传耕者有其田的主张，提出：“把身翻透”的口号，结合反内战保卫翻身利益的时事教育，解除了群众“变天”顾虑，鼓舞了群众再起斗争的勇气与决心，东关霍二和尚为前半年未发动起来的老实农民，这次也和地主对面讲理了。上月中旬全城关展开了向地主的总清算，在讲理算帐中，恶霸劣绅曾千方百计顽强抗拒，但理屈力薄，只得向群众低头，退出东西。此次总清算斗争中由于团结了广大中农，使运动增加很大力量，运动中领导上曾来了一次“整军运动”，进一步打破了中农的观望态度，团结了广大的中农群众，如东关上半年每次斗争中参加者仅七十余人，现在达二百余人，积极分子也大为增加。初步统计全城关地主、恶霸低头后赔偿群众之财物计有：银洋六千四百余元，银子一百六十两，冀钞十二万余元，牲口十五头，羊一百余只，粮食四十六石，随即合理分配。分配中，抓紧进行了阶级教育。群众觉悟提高，不少农民对着地主退出来的东西想起过去，纷纷落泪。东关群众并自愿抽出十三万元，帮助外村穷人翻身。
