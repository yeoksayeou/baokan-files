In the short span of eight months, from February to the present, with rudimentary organization and limited manpower, under the direct leadership of the Central Bureau and the enthusiastic support of the entire region's military, government, and people, and through the efforts of all comrades in the branch, we have largely completed the reporting tasks of each period, participated in the national political and military struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, and played a considerable role in reporting on the region's dynamics and exchanging experiences. Numerically, we sent a total of 820,000 characters to Yan'an in eight months, with Yan'an forwarding 224,283 characters. From the establishment of the People's Daily on May 15th to August, we supplied over 600,000 characters of稿, and the General Branch received approximately 2 million characters of稿 from various branches. This simple figure not only outlines the reporting work in the Jinji Luyu Border Region but, more importantly, illustrates the enthusiastic efforts of the Party, government, military, and people in supporting this work, enabling the four branches to supplement manpower, strengthen relations with various departments, and achieve significant progress in business.

However, in the current situation where the liberated areas are launching a mass movement reaching a climax, and the patriotic self-defense war is surging, our reporting appears very weak and unbalanced, insufficient to meet the needs of the struggle. The most fundamental weakness is the fragmented, lengthy, generalized, and slow nature of news content, lacking systematicness and guidance, which greatly affects external propaganda and the exchange of information and experiences between regions.

"Taking a step forward" is not only completely imperative given the current working foundation, but also the urgent demand of all comrades. Here, based on some fragmented experiences from the past few months, we put forward some business-related opinions, hoping to discuss and encourage each other with all comrades in the branch.

(1) Strengthening News Guidance

In the daily busy and urgent reporting tasks, it is easy to develop a blind, technical, and bureaucratic style of reporting for the sake of reporting. The reason for this is unclear thinking and a lack of clarity in the mind, so it is difficult to determine how to decide, cut, and layout among a large pile of materials to increase the propaganda effect. Clear thinking requires the writers to skillfully embody Comrade Mao Zedong's principles and line in every news story. For example, reporting on the war must fully understand the principles and spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare, thereby helping readers to recognize the loss of a city or a place from a positive perspective. The report on the loss of Jiangxian City, while emphasizing that the people emptied their houses and fields, refused to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek's army, and turned to long-term siege and attrition, is a good example. For another example, in reporting on the patriotic self-defense war, our strong reflection of the national mobilization to support the front line and guerrilla warfare, using facts to explain the characteristics of the war, is fully in line with the spirit of the Party and directly supports the war. Secondly, it is necessary to study the guiding intentions and spirit of the Central Bureau, Military Region, Border Government, and various district Party committees for each specific political task or central task at any time. Some of our branches can collect very rich materials, but they suffer from the inability to improve. Although there are many reasons, one of the main reasons is that they have not studied the Party's policies and instructions well, and often only use fixed and old views to process the materials, and cannot discover new things. Recently, there was a news item stating that the masses in a certain village urgently demanded land reform. Based on the spirit of "land to the tiller," the leadership quickly mobilized the masses. In the process of mobilization, the masses conducted grievances. If we do not understand the current guiding spirit of letting go of the masses and realizing "land to the tiller," then we cannot attach importance to the urgent demand of the masses and can only report a stereotyped grievance meeting, and the news will be diminished. Finally, in the face of the new reporting policy, in addition to discussing the policy, clarifying ideas, and organizing articles to various branches and key correspondents, the General Branch also sent reporters to directly participate in the翻身队, gain practical experience, and excavate typical cases. It also worked with the county Party committee in nearby villages to participate in the work of typical villages, jointly report experiences, and promote the翻身movement of "land to the tiller" throughout the region. This is the only way to deeply understand the opinions of the higher-level leadership, take the initiative to grasp the policy, and provide timely guidance.

(2) Learning from the General Headquarters

Studying the original manuscript by comparing it with the General Headquarters' rebroadcast manuscript word by word and sentence by sentence is a good way for the General Branch to make progress. There is much to learn from the General Headquarters. What we have currently experienced: The first is that the vision is placed far. For example, the rampant harassment of puppet troops in Gaotang in Southern Hebei is a struggle on the edge of the area. However, from the perspective of the overall war situation, coupled with the reinforcement of the Kuomintang's 12th Army from Jinan, it has formed part of the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war in Shandong. Because of not paying attention to the overall situation, limiting the vision to Southern Hebei, and reporting on the harassment of puppet troops in Gaotang in isolation, the serious political significance of this battle report is reduced. It is very important for the General Headquarters to help us supplement this deficiency in propaganda. The second is political rigor, meticulousness. Often, a battle report or political news is exchanged by telegram several times. A person's name, a designation, a place name must be made very accurate. For example, our region had 75,000 people demobilized before and after twice. The General Headquarters repeatedly inquired about the number of demobilized personnel to avoid errors in the telegram. For every Chiang Kai-shek's army offensive message, the General Headquarters carefully studies its military intentions, where it comes from, where it goes, and the location and route are clarified before it can be released. Because, only by clearly stating the facts can our reports be credible to domestic and foreign people, and can effectively shatter the distortions and rumors of the Central News Agency. Finally, the General Headquarters is good at distinguishing between the target audience and grasping the characteristics of various regions. We often ignore the target audience in releasing news. We reported on the self-defense war in Southern Shanxi, but neglected that other liberated areas and the people of the whole country are unfamiliar with the Southern Shanxi liberated area, so we must provide explanations, annotations, and introductions. When we publicize the mutual aid groups or rent reduction and debt liquidation that we have long been accustomed to, we often do not consider that readers outside the liberated area do not understand the mutual aid groups very well. Those complicated numbers, rigid terms, and experiences should be appropriately deleted and replaced with vivid and lively stories with propaganda value. Or use the method of comparison to help readers gain understanding.

(3) Improving Business

Without business learning, the work of the news agency will never be done well.

One of the worst styles is to handle稿like流水帳. If there is a manuscript, it is rewritten a little bit, and when it is rewritten, the work is over. This practice has hindered our improvement for a long time. In addition to strengthening political learning and flexibly grasping policies, the method of improvement requires:

(1) In the recent two months of work, we have gradually explored some basic construction work of the news agency according to the needs of the work, which roughly includes: understanding the situation and characteristics of each region, accumulating various materials for comprehensive use at any time, and building some tools to assist editing work such as maps, administrative areas, and character notes. If the news agency lacks this work, it will be in a passive position everywhere. For example, people who write military news must have a diary of the war situation, a map of the enemy's distribution, designations, war maps, accurate maps, and necessary historical materials (such as recovering Zhuxian Town, it is okay to quote two sentences from the history of Zhuxian Town). We still lack a complete overview of the border area to this day, and of course, we cannot report the face of the border area better. For example, Southern Hebei is a nationally famous place with developed textile industry, and there has not been a comprehensive report to this day.

(2) Master the basic documents of the General Headquarters as weapons. Recently, we have specially studied the General Headquarters' work instructions for 1946, the conciseness of telegrams, the five major elements of news, and other documents, and found that although we have been engaged in news work for many years, we have not found a very clear and complete answer in our work experience to the questions of what is news, what is telegram, and how to write this type of question. Until we studied these documents, we were shocked to discover the harm of not studying the news business while doing news work.

(3) Summarize experience at any time. The General Branch has a weekly work report to summarize the experience of the week, a monthly summary, and provides experience notification branches at any time and place to discover problems. After processing a manuscript, each comrade records the main points of their experience in a notebook. This work is also completely necessary for a branch. We hope that each branch will summarize various specific experiences in detail from now until the end of the year.

(4) Every month, study a few good articles, newsletters, and news, explore various news writing forms, and learn to use new vocabularies and sentences. This is one of the important business learning activities. Like Mrs. Sun's statement, some famous foreign journalist correspondences, typical news rebroadcast by Xinhua News Agency, and our own good and bad typical works can be used as objects for our reference and research.

(4) Selecting and Compiling News: Concise Selection and Simplicity. We have recently made considerable progress. In March, April, and May, we sent an average of more than 160,000 characters to Yan'an every day, and the General Headquarters rebroadcast an average of 30,000 characters. In the past two months, we sent an average of 70,000 characters per month, while the General Headquarters rebroadcast more than 30,000 characters, reducing a lot of waste of manpower and materials.

First of all, in the selection of articles, we must adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, rather than abusing, and break the tendency of quantity over quality. The first is to be good at organizing central reports, such as focusing on the political offensive of the military self-defense war, supporting the front line, anti-civil war uprisings... For example, reporting on various liquidation methods centered on "land to the tiller." All of this should be concentrated under a clear center and reported quickly. Second, discover new themes, such as reforming bandits in mass movements, Jiao Zuo orphanage orphans returning to well-fed homes, prostitutes being liberated to participate in production, and using some aspects that are often not noticed to illustrate the superiority and healthy characteristics of the new democracy. In addition, various new forms can be adopted. The fast beat written by Comrade Ye Feng "Mr. Chen" and the "Chairman Mao in the Eyes of the People of Changzhi" in Taihang are all relatively successful works that were rebroadcast and praised by the General Headquarters. Third, among the nearly 8,000 telegrams and an average of 3,000 characters of contributions from correspondents that we come into contact with every day, fragmented news often accounts for more than two-thirds. Therefore, on the one hand, we collectively and carefully select good articles so that they are not missed, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to the work of data sorting and comprehensive work, so that fragmented materials are gradually supplemented into complete news.

The task of compiling the selected articles and determining the selection and omission of news content is to make the news telegram concise and clear. Although the General Branch and the branches have made some improvements in this regard, compared with other brother branches, we still need to work hard. Now we are willing to put forward a few ideological questions for discussion:

"Does having numbers mean that the news is specific?" We have had many articles with lengthy numbers, but they did not explain any problems. There was a news item writing that 400,000 people participated in the struggle, but in content, there was only a grievance meeting in one village, and the result was still empty. We must have vivid facts. Numbers are only useful when they properly explain the truth.

"Is it considered to be clear to write news without missing a single material from beginning to end?" We can find such news every day. When writing about the conference, we must write in detail from the significance of the conference, everyone's speech, resolutions, telegrams... Some comrades often write news in the form of work summaries or features, which wastes a lot of manpower and material resources, and the impression given to readers is still blurred. We must learn to find the most vivid, prominent, and strong point in the material as the theme, and use the simplest and clearest language to make readers understand it at a glance and leave a deep impression. It is impossible to write good news if you take everything into account.

"Must comprehensive and typical news be long?" Obviously not. We have had many short and concise typical or comprehensive news. The Longhai Front reporter group wrote that the siege of Lanfeng used a battle fragment and a character to write about the bravery and good fighting of our army, using only 400 words, and wrote that General Chen Geng participated in the Baijin line mediation and captured the Japanese gunner alive in only 100 words, but they were all praised by the General Headquarters. As for comprehensiveness, it is by no means simply stacking materials. Every comprehensive news must have certain typical materials as the backbone and set off with secondary materials, so that the center is prominent and the text must be concise.

In the past, the General Branch did not write concise news, mainly because these ideological problems existed. Only by considering the gains and losses from the entire propaganda effect can the conciseness of the news be easily solved.

　　新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社
    九一致分支社及特约记者一封公开信
    从二月到现在，短短八个月的工夫，我们以简陋机构和有限人力在中央局直接领导和全区军政民热情扶助之下，经过分社全体同志的努力，大体上完成各个时期的报导任务，参加了为争取独立和平民主的全国政治军事斗争，并在报导全区动态和交流经验上发挥了相当作用，单从数目字来看，八个月共发延安八十二万字，延安转发二十二万四千二百八十三字，五月十五日人民日报创刊至八月止我们供给稿在六十万字以上，总分社收到各分社稿件约计在二百万字左右，这一简单数字不仅是指明晋冀鲁豫边区报导工作的一个轮廓，尤其重要的是说明了党政军民都在热切的努力扶植这一工作，致使四个分社得以补充人力，密切同各部门的关系，在业务上获有较为显著的进步。
    然而，处在目前解放区发动群众走向高潮，爱国自卫战争汹涌澎湃之际，我们的报导却显得十分薄弱十分不平衡，尚不足以应付斗争的需要，其中最根本的一个弱点，是新闻内容零碎、冗长一般化，迟缓，缺乏系统性和指导性，大大的影响了对外宣传以及交流各区情况和经验。
    “提高一步”，从现在工作基础来看是完全刻不容缓的了，这也正是全体同志的迫切要求，在这里，我们依据过去几个月的一些零碎经验，提出几个有关业务上的意见，愿与分支社全体同志研讨共勉。
    （一）加强新闻指导性
    在日常繁忙而又紧迫的报导任务中，常常容易产生一种盲目的为报导而报导的技术化事务化的作风，究其因，是思想不明确，头脑不清醒，所以在一大堆材料之中不知道如何定裁和布局，增加宣传效果。思想明确，首在编写同志善于把毛泽东同志的原则路线灵活地体现在每一个新闻中去，譬如报导战争就必须充分体会毛泽东同志的运动战游击战的原则精神，从而帮助读者从积极方面来认识一城一地之失，在报导绛县城失守时同时着重反映了人民空舍清野，拒与蒋军合作，转入长期围困和消耗，便是一个较好的例子。又如报导爱国自卫战争，我们强烈的反映全民动员支援前线。游击战争，用事实说明战争特点是完全符合于党的精神，直接策应了战争的。其次，是随时研究中央局、军区、边府及各区党委对每一个具体政治任务或中心工作的指导意图和精神，我们有些分社能够搜集很丰富的材料，但苦于提不高原因虽多，其中主要之一点，是没有很好研究党的政策指示，往往只用固定的陈旧的观点去处理材料，无法发现新的事物。最近有一个新闻说明某村群众迫切要求土地改革，领导上根据耕者有其田的精神将群众迅速的发动起来，在发动的过程中，群众曾进行了诉苦，如果我们不了解当前放手发动群众实现耕者有其田的指导精神，那么我们便不可能重视群众这一迫切的要求，只能照例报导一个千篇一律的诉苦大会，消息便随之减色了。最后，在新的报导方针面前，总分社除了讨论方针，明确思想，向各分社和骨干通讯员组织稿件外，我们还派了记者直接参加翻身队，取得实感，发掘典型，又在附近驻村与县委共同参加典型村庄工作，共同报导经验，推动全区耕者有其田的翻身运动，这样才能深刻领会上级领导意见，主动的掌握方针及时进行指导。
    （二）向总社学习
    逐篇逐字逐句的对照总社转播稿来研究原稿是总分社获得进步一个好的方法；总社值得学习处甚多，目前我们体会到的：第一是眼光放得远，譬如高唐伪军的猖獗出扰，在冀南是边沿区的斗争。然而从战争全局来看，加上国民党第十二军从济南的增援，它已经形成了国民党扩大山东内战的一部分。由于不注视全面局势，眼光只限制在冀南，孤立的报导高唐伪军出扰，减低了这一战报严重的政治意义。总社帮助我们补充这一缺陷在宣传上是非常重要的。第二是政治上的谨严，一丝不苟。往往一个战报或政治新闻往返电商数次，一个人名，一个番号，一个地名都要弄得十分确切，譬如我区复员前后两次均为七万五千人，总社曾再三电询复员数目以免电文传讹；每一条蒋军进攻消息，总社都审慎的研究其军事企图，从何处来，向何处去，地点路线均弄清楚，然后才能发布，因为，只有最清晰的说明事实，我们的报导方能取信于国内外人士，才能有力的击碎中央社的歪曲与造谣。最后是总社善于分别读者对象，把握各个地区特点，我们常常在发布新闻中忽视了读者对象，我们报导汾南自卫战争，却忽略其他解放区和全国人民对于汾南解放区是生疏的，因而必需有所说明注释和介绍。我们向外宣传我们早已听惯了的互助组或者是减租清债时，我们常常不去考虑解放区以外的读者是不大十分懂得互助组的，那些庞杂的数目字，生硬的名词和经验，都应适当的删削，而代之以生动活泼富有宣传价值的故事。或是使用对比的方法去帮助读者获得理解。
    （三）改进业务
    没有业务学习，通讯社工作是永远不会做好的。
    一个最恶劣的作风是：流水帐似的处理稿件，有稿子就改写两下，改写完了工作也就完了。这种作法曾经有一个很长时期阻碍着我们提高。改进的方法，除了加强政治学习，灵活的掌握政策外，在新闻业务本身还需要：
    （１）我们在最近两月工作中，逐渐的按照工作需要摸索到一些通讯社基本建设工作，这大体上包括有：了解各个区域情况及特点，积蓄各种材料以便随时综合，建设一些补助编辑工作的工具如地图，行政区域，人物备考。通讯社缺乏这些工作，便会处处陷于被动，譬如：写军事新闻的人，必须要有战争情况的日记，敌情分布图，番号，战况图，精确的地图以及必要的史料（如收复朱仙镇，无妨引用两句朱仙镇的历史）。我们一直到今天还缺乏一个完整的边区概况，当然，也就无法把边区的面貌报导的更好，像冀南是全国闻名的纺织业发达地方，至今尚未有一次全面的报导。
    （２）掌握总社几个基本文件做为武器，最近我们专门学习了总社一九四六年工作指示，电讯要简练，新闻五大要素等文件，发现自己虽然是从事多年的新闻工作了，可是对于什么是新闻，什么是电讯，怎样写这一类问题，还没有在自己的工作经验中找到十分明确完整的答复，及至我们研究了这些文件之后，才大吃一惊，发现作新闻工作不研究新闻业务的害处。
    （３）随时总结经验，总分社每星期有工作周报，总结一周的经验，有月终总结，并随时随地发现问题提供经验通报分社，每个同志在处理一篇稿子之后，将自己的心得择其要者记在本子上。这一些工作对于一个分社也是完全必需的。我们希望各分社从现在开始到年底把各种具体经验加以详细总结。
    （４）每月要研究几篇好的文章通讯新闻，探求各种新闻写作形式，学习使用新的语汇字句，这是重要的业务学习之一。像孙夫人的声明，一些有名的外籍记者通讯，新华社转播的典型新闻，和我们本身好的和不好的典型作品都可以做为我们参考研究的对象。
    （四）选稿与编写新闻精选与简练，我们在最近已获得不少的进步，在三、四、五月中我们向延安平均每日发十六万字以上，总社平均转播三万字，最近两月我们平均每月发七万字而总社转播者则在三万字以上，减少了许多人力与物力的浪费。
    首先在选稿上，必须坚持实事求是宁缺勿滥的精神，打破以量胜质的倾向。第一要善于组织中心报导，如围绕军事自卫战的政治攻势，支援前线，反内战起义……。如围绕着耕者有其田报导各种清算方法，这一切都应在一个明确中心下集中起来迅速报导。第二多发现新的题材，如群众运动中改造土匪，焦作孤儿院孤儿重返丰衣足食的家园，妓女被解放参加生产，从一些常为人们所不注意的侧面说明新民主主义的优越与健康特性。此外可以采取各种新的形式，叶枫同志所写的快板《陈先生》，太行的《长治人民眼中的毛主席》，都是为总社转播并加表扬的比较成功的作品。第三我们每日所接触的将近八千的电稿和通讯员平均三千字的来稿中，零碎的消息常占三分之二以上，因此一面集体的，仔细的选择好稿不使遗漏，一面要十分注意资料整理综合工作，使零碎的素材逐渐补充成为完整的新闻。
    选稿、确定新闻内容的取舍，剩下的编写任务便是使新闻电讯简练明快。总分社和分社在这方面虽有一些改进，但比起其他兄弟分社来还需要大大努力，现在我们愿就几个思想问题提出来讨论：
    “有了数目字是否就表示新闻具体呢”？我们曾有不少稿子连篇累牍的数目字，但并没有说明任何问题，曾有一条新闻写四十万人参加斗争，但在内容上却只有一个村的诉苦大会，结果仍是空洞。我们必须有生动的事实，数目字只有在恰当的说明事实真相时才有用处。
    “从头到尾一点材料都不遗漏的写新闻是否算是交代清楚了呢”？我们每天都可以找到这样的新闻，写大会，一定从会议的意义，每个人的讲话，决议，通电……都要详尽无遗的写进去；有些同志常常用工作总结的方式或者是写通讯特写的方式来写消息，这种写法浪费人力物力既巨，给予读者的印象仍是模糊的一片。我们必须学会从素材中寻找最生动突出强烈一点当作主题，用最简单明确的语言使读者一目了然，印象深刻。面面俱到是不能写好新闻的。
    “综合的典型的新闻是不是就必须是长的？”显然不是的，我们曾有不少短小精捍的典型的或是综合的新闻。陇海前线记者团写兰封攻城从一个战斗片断和一个人物写出我军的英勇善战，只用了四百字，写陈赓将军参加白晋线调处活捉日炮手只用了一百字，然而都得到了总社的表扬。至于综合，也绝不是单纯堆积材料。每一个综合新闻必须有一定的典型材料作为骨干而衬托以次要的材料，这样中心突出，文字自必精练。
    总分社过去编写新闻不简练，主要是存在这几个思想问题，只有从整个宣传效果上考虑得失，新闻简练才可迎刃而决。
