Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 31st - Seven Japanese soldiers, Mizuno Kantoku, Ohno Hirohisa, Tomejima Jiro, Sato Seikichi, Akiyama Minoru, and translator Zhang Shengliang (from Hebei), who were forcibly retained in Shanxi by Yan Xishan to engage in civil war, escaped from Xin County on the 18th of this month. They carried three Japanese-made handguns with more than 30 rounds of ammunition and a pair of binoculars, and have now arrived in the Xin County Liberated Area. According to Mizuno and others, they were originally from the Japanese 3rd Mixed Brigade. After Japan's surrender, Yan Xishan forcibly retained more than 1,000 members of the brigade to engage in civil war, telling them, "Japan has been occupied by the American army. Returning home would mean being oppressed as citizens of a conquered nation. It would be better to stay in China for two years and wait for a good opportunity." After being incorporated into the Special Service Regiment, they were reorganized into the 3rd Security Battalion with a total of more than 340 people, who are currently stationed in Xin County.

　　不愿充阎锡山内战工具日军七人逃入我区
    【新华社张家口三十一日电】被阎锡山强留山西进行内战之日军水野间德、大野广久、留岛次郎、佐藤清吉，秋山实及翻译张胜良（河北人）等七人；于本月十八日自忻县逃出，携日造手枪三支子弹三十余发，望远镜一付，现已到达忻县解放区。据水野等谈称：他们原为日军第三混成旅团，日本投降后，阎锡山强留该旅团千余人进行内战，并对他们说：“日本已被美军占领，回去当亡国奴受压迫，不如在华留驻二年等待良机。”他们于编入特务团后又被编为保安第三大队共三百四十余人，现仍驻在忻县城内。
