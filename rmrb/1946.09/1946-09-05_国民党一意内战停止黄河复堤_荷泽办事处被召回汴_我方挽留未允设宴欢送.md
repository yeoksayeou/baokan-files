　　Kuomintang Insists on Civil War, Halts Yellow River Embankment Restoration
    Heze Office Recalled to Bian
    Our Side Retained Without Success, Farewell Banquet Held
    [Heze, 3rd Dispatch] The Kuomintang is bent on expanding the civil war and has halted the Yellow River embankment restoration. The UNRRA Executive Office Heze Office was recalled to Bian on the 27th. The Yellow River embankment restoration project has been underway for three months since the Heze Agreement stipulated on May 15th that the UNRRA Executive Office would establish an office in Heze. During these three months, the Kuomintang failed to implement the agreement and repeatedly delayed the supply of materials. However, with the efforts of the democratic government and the people of the liberated areas, the preliminary Yellow River embankment restoration project has been largely completed. Unexpectedly, after the Kuomintang launched a large-scale offensive against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area along the Longhai Railway in early August, the supply of materials was completely cut off, and the Yellow River embankment restoration project was suspended. Furthermore, the UNRRA Executive Office Heze Office recently received an order from the UNRRA Executive Office in Kaifeng to withdraw to Kaifeng. Before the withdrawal, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office repeatedly tried to retain them, stating that the Yellow River embankment restoration project should not be affected by military affairs and should continue, and that their living difficulties could be resolved, but unfortunately, it was not approved. Before the departure of the more than 50 members of the office, the Administrative Office specially held a farewell banquet. Director Duan Junyi of the Administrative Office delivered a farewell speech, saying: Although it was agreed that the Yellow River project should not be affected by military and political affairs, the Kuomintang's military blockade and offensive against the border areas ultimately led to the suspension of the Yellow River project, which is very regrettable. Peng Anjie (an American), director of the UNRRA Heze Office, said: I disagree with many aspects of the United States' policy towards China. They don't understand the situation of the Chinese people very well. When I return to the United States, I will definitely do my best to tell them. Peng hoped that peace would come soon so that work could resume. Ma Fengtai, director of the UNRRA Henan Branch Heze Warehouse, said: We have only worked in Heze for three months, and the Yellow River embankment restoration project has achieved such results thanks to the government and people of the liberated area. Now, more than 50 people, including the UNRRA Executive Office, have returned to Kaifeng on the 27th, accompanied by Yang Gongsu of the Yellow River Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area.

　　国民党一意内战停止黄河复堤
    荷泽办事处被召回汴
    我方挽留未允设宴欢送
    【荷泽三日电】国民党一意扩大内战，停止黄河复堤，二十七日联总行总驻荷泽办事处被召回汴。按黄河复堤工程自五月十五日荷泽协议规定联总行总在荷设立办事处，至今已三个月。在此三个月中，国民党不执行协议，一再拖延物资供应，但在民主政府和解放区人民努力下，黄河初步复堤，工程已完成大部，岂料国民党自八月初在陇海线开始向我冀鲁豫解放区大举进攻后，物资供应，完全断绝，黄河复堤工程，随遭停顿，且联总行总驻荷泽办事处复于日前接获开封联总行总命令撤回开封。在未撤回前，我冀鲁豫行署曾一再挽留，表示黄河复堤工程，应受军事影响，继续进行，并可解决其生活困难，不幸竟未获允。该办事处五十余人临行前，行署特设宴欢送，行署段主任君毅席间致欢送词称：黄河工程虽经协议不应受军事政治影响，但国民党方面对边区施行军事封锁与进攻，致使黄河工程终于停顿，殊为遗憾。联总驻荷泽主任彭安杰（美人）称：美国对中国政策我有许多地方不同意，他们不很了解中国老百姓的情形，我回美国一定能尽力告诉他们。彭氏希望和平早日到来，可以恢复工作。行总河南分署驻荷泽仓库主任马凤台说：我们来荷泽仅工作三个月，黄河复堤工程有如此成绩，都是解放区的政府和老百姓的功劳。现联总行总等五十多人已于二十七日，由冀鲁豫解放区黄委会杨公素伴随返回开封。
