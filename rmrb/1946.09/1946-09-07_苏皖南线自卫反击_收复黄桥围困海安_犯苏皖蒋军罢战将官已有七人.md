　　Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 4th: After a day and two nights of self-defense counterattacks, a unit of the New Fourth Army on the Southern Jiangsu-Anhui Front recovered Huangqiao town on August 31st. The remnants of the 187th Brigade (formerly a division) of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which had invaded the town (most of which had been annihilated in the Jialishi campaign), were captured in their entirety, numbering more than 600. The New Fourth Army seized more than 60 light and heavy machine guns and many other military supplies. Chiang Kai-shek's troops coming to aid from Taixing were also routed. Huangqiao is one of the key military locations on the southern line of central Jiangsu, controlling the transportation hub between Taizhou, Taixing, Jingjiang, and Rugao. It was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the New Fourth Army in September last year, and occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on July 16th this year. Furthermore, another unit of the New Fourth Army has completely recovered all strongholds surrounding Haian. The Chiang Kai-shek troops besieged in Haian are running out of ammunition and reinforcements, and the New Fourth Army is urging them to lay down their arms.
    Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 4th: As of now, it has been verified that seven Chiang Kai-shek army general-level officers who invaded the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas have laid down their weapons. They are: Deputy Brigade Commander Xi Shengkai of the 92nd Brigade (formerly a division) in the Yugou campaign, Brigade Chief of Staff Liu Qiaoshen, Deputy Brigade Commander Tian Congyun of the New 7th Brigade (formerly a division) in the battle east of Haian, Deputy Brigade Commander Jin Ya of the 105th Brigade (formerly a division), Deputy Brigade Commander Liu Guangguo of the 90th Brigade (formerly a division) in the Fenjiezhen campaign, as well as Lieutenant General Liang Lailin, Brigade Commander of the 187th Brigade (formerly a division), and Major General Mai Xiachong, Deputy Brigade Commander, in the Jialishi campaign on the Ru (gao) Huang (qiao) line on August 27th.

　　苏皖南线自卫反击
    收复黄桥围困海安
    犯苏皖蒋军罢战将官已有七人
    【新华社苏中前线四日电】苏皖南线新四军一部经一天两夜自卫反击，于八月三十一日收复黄桥镇。侵驻该镇蒋军一八七旅（师改称）残部（其大部已被歼于加力市战役）六百余人全部被俘，新四军缴获轻重机枪六十余挺，其他军用品甚多。由泰兴来援之蒋军亦被击溃。黄桥为苏中南线军事要地之一，握泰州、泰兴、靖江、如皋间交通枢纽，去年九月间新四军从日寇手中解放，今年七月十六日为蒋军所侵占。又新四军另部已完全收复海安周围各据点，海安被围蒋军弹尽援绝，新四军正促其放下武器。
    【新华社苏中前线四日电】截至目前为止，侵犯苏皖解放区蒋军将级军官放下武器者据查明已有七名，即渔沟战役中之九十二旅（师改称）副旅长洗盛楷，旅参谋长刘桥身，海安以东战役中之新七旅（师改称）副旅长田从云，一○五旅（师改称）副旅长金亚，分界镇战役中之九十旅（师改称）副旅长刘光国五人，以及八月二十七日如（皋）黄（桥）线上加力市战役中之一八七旅（师改称）中将旅长梁来林与少将副旅长麦霞冲。
