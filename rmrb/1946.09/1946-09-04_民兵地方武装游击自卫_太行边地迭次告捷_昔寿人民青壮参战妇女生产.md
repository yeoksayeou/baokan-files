　　Militia Local Armed Guerrilla Self-Defense
    Victories Repeatedly Reported in the Taihang Border Region
    Youth and Adults from Xishou Join the Army, Women Engage in Production
    [Report from our newspaper in Changzhi, 31st] The local armed forces and militia in the Taihang border areas have achieved repeated victories in self-defense guerrilla warfare. On the 11th, over 80 of Yan Xishan's special agent forces stationed in Hancun, Taigu, attacked Chaoyang and were ambushed by our Taigu Independent Battalion. Yan's special agents left behind 27 corpses, and we captured 5 alive, seizing one submachine gun, one small cannon, and ten rifles. On the 14th, over 100 Yan's puppet troops and over 100 civilians from Pingyao, with 40 carts, raided Haojiao Village in Pingyao to plunder. Our Qixian Independent Battalion, upon hearing the news, immediately rushed to intercept them, killing or wounding 17 of Yan's and puppet troops. Forty-two shih of wheat that had been looted were all intercepted and returned to the masses. On the 17th, over 50 of Yan's puppet troops stationed in Zhicun, Qixian, attacked Wengqu Village. Our Qixian Independent Battalion ambushed them north of Wengqu Village, encircling and fiercely attacking them from all sides, killing over 20, including their assistants, and capturing 19, including the deputy captain. We seized two machine guns, 24 rifles, one grenade launcher, and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition. We only suffered four minor injuries. On the 8th, over 200 men from the Kuomintang army's security regiment stationed in Wuzhi, northern Henan, attacked Beifan and Dafan. They were immediately discovered by our militia, who, in coordination with the regular army, rose up in self-defense and fought back bravely. The fierce battle continued until dark, when the Kuomintang army fled in panic, with over 20 Kuomintang and puppet troops killed or wounded, one captured, and one rifle seized. On the 9th and 10th, they continued to repel the unit's two attacks. The militia, a support team from Changzhi and Pingshun, won the praise and support of the local masses, who spontaneously launched comfort activities.
    [Report from Changzhi, 31st] The people of Xiyang and Shouyang counties have all participated in the self-defense operations along the Zhengtai Railway line with passionate and tense emotions. Xiyang mobilized 1,500 militiamen to assist the army in combat on the Shouyang front. When they set off, they unanimously vowed: "We will not return home until the task is completed." Jin Wang, from Laoligou Village in the county, said when he set off: "We have turned over and cannot forget that many people in the border area of Shouyang are suffering from the attacks and oppression of Yan's and puppet troops and cannot live. This time, we are going to fight back against the reactionaries and help the people turn over." The entire village of Qianshang Village in the first district of Shouyang, men, women, old and young, were all involved in the movement to support the front. All the young and middle-aged people went to the front line, while the elderly women and children took on the rear service tasks and production work. In addition to taking care of the wounded and acting as sentries, the women also organized themselves to carry out production and wash and sew clothes for the army. Under the leadership of the Women's Salvation Association, the women of the village washed a total of 2,589 pieces of clothing, sewed 31 pieces of clothing, 137 quilts, 678 pairs of socks, and 1,342 pairs of shoelaces in three days. Zheng Zhirong, chairman of the Women's Salvation Association, took out two chi of cloth that she had prepared to make socks and used it to mend clothes for the army. She said, "The Eighth Route Army came, and I turned over and had the good life I have today. Now, if I don't help the army defend itself, I still won't be able to live in peace."
