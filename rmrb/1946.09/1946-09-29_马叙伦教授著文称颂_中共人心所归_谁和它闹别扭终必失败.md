Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th -- The renowned liberalist Professor Ma Xulun published an article in the August 28th shutdown issue of Shanghai's "Weekly Review," discussing how the Chinese Communist Party is loved by the people, and anyone who tries to go against it is destined to fail. Ma pointed out that the term "Communist bandits" is outdated, saying: "The term 'Communist bandits' has been around for many years. Since they withdrew from Jiangxi in the Long March and established a base in the Northwest, their strength has gradually increased. The people under their rule not only coexist peacefully with them but also understand what they are. Recently, at least seven-tenths of China's intellectual circles have sympathized with them, and they have gained equal status with the Kuomintang in the War of Resistance. The words 'Communist bandits' may still be 'heavily emphasized' in the Kuomintang's dictionary, but apart from the Kuomintang itself and those who are products of feudalism, the impression of the word 'bandit' has not only faded but has completely disappeared." Ma stated that labeling this revolutionary party with the title of "bandit" is like the Qing Dynasty calling the Tongmenghui "bandits" and Yuan Shikai calling the Kuomintang "revolutionary bandits." History will certainly not give them these titles in the future. Ma said: The Communist Party is now practicing New Democracy, a land policy to win over the vast number of peasants. It has developed to this extent, and it has grasped this core. "The Kuomintang is only quarreling with it, trying to use force to solve this real threat, which is just asking for trouble, and failure is inevitable!"

　　马叙伦教授著文称颂
　　中共人心所归
　　谁和它闹别扭终必失败
    【新华社延安二十六日电】著名的自由主义者马叙伦教授，在八月二十八日出版的上海“周报”休刊号著文，论述中国共产党为人民所爱戴，谁想和它闹别扭，必然终归失败。马氏指出“共匪”一词，已失时效说：“‘共匪’的名词出现许多年了，自从他撤离江西万里长征到达西北，在延安建立了基础，力量逐渐增加。他统治下的人民，对他不但相安，而且了解他是什么。到了最近，中国的思想界至少已十分之七的人氏已经同情了他，他从抗战中得了和国民党平等的地位。‘共匪’两个字，在国民党字典上或者还是‘大书特书’，但是除了其本身和封建产物的人，这个‘匪’字的印象不但冲淡，简直消灭了。”马氏说：对于这一革命政党加以“匪”的头衔，正如满清称同盟会为“匪”，袁世凯称国民党为“革匪”一样，将来历史决不会照样给他这些头衔。马氏说：共产党现在行的是新民主主义，是争取广大的农民的土地政策，他已经发展到了这个程度，而且他已抓住了这个中心，“国民党只和他闹别扭，想用武力来解决这个真正的威胁，只是自讨苦吃，终于失败是必然的！”
