    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th】Beiping Dispatch: The anniversary of the Japanese surrender, held here on the 3rd, has actually turned into a mobilization meeting for the Kuomintang reactionaries to conduct a civil war and sell out the country. On that day, students from various schools and shop clerks in the city were forcibly assembled in front of the Taihe Hall by the authorities, where Li Zongren, Xiong Bin, Wu Zhiren, and others successively called for continuing to expand the civil war and "eliminate the Chinese Communist Party." At the same time, costumed car propaganda teams appeared in the central streets of Beiping, shouting anti-communist slogans with megaphones under the armed protection of military police, cutting off traffic, detaining pedestrians, and trams were also filled with huge anti-communist and pro-civil war banners of various colors.
