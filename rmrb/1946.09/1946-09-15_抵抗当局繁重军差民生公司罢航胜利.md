　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: According to a Tianjin Dagong Bao dispatch from Chongqing on August 27th: The Minsheng Company announced a strike on the 24th of last month to passively resist the heavy military transportation imposed by the Kuomintang authorities. They persisted for three days, until the 26th when the authorities agreed to return the "Minben" and "Minwu" ships to Chongqing and guaranteed that the "Minlian" and "Mingui" ships sailing from Jiujiang and Shashi would not be subject to requisitions. It is reported that of the company's more than one hundred ships of all sizes, 99 percent were forced to be requisitioned, resulting in a monthly loss of 80 million yuan and the imminent risk of business closure. The company had submitted a request to the Kuomintang authorities on the 23rd of last month to release some ships to maintain operations, but to no avail, which triggered this strike.

　　抵抗当局繁重军差民生公司罢航胜利
    【新华社延安十一日电】据天津大公报重庆八月二十七日专电：民生公司自上月二十四日宣布罢航，以消极抵抗国民党当局之繁重军运，坚持三天，直至二十六日当局答应发还民本、民武两辆返渝，并保证由九江、沙市上航之民联、民贵不得应差为止。按该公司共有大小船只一百余只，百分之九十九均被迫令应差，每月亏蚀达八万万元之多，随时有停业之虞。该公司曾于上月二十三日向国民党当局提出放回部分船只，以维营业之要求，然毫无结果，始激起此次罢航。
