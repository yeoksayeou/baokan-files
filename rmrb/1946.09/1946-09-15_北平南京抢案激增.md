Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Beiping News: According to the local police bureau, from the 1st to the 13th of last month, 14 robbery cases occurred in the city, averaging one robbery per day. This is more than double the rate compared to the 15 robbery cases reported by the police bureau for the entire month of July, which averaged one robbery every two days. Among these 14 robbery cases, the most sensational was the robbery of the Tianbao Gold Store outside Qianmen ten days ago. At noon in broad daylight, 20 taels of gold were snatched by an armed bandit claiming to be an American student, who even forced the owner to hire a car to drive him away. This was followed by the robbery of 500 US dollars in the northern suburbs on the 11th and the robbery of 10 million yuan on Wai Damochang on the 12th. As for smaller robberies not included in the police statistics, they occur frequently in the streets and alleys. For example, Peng Zigang, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, had his bicycle stolen, and Professor Qiu Zhuang had his gold watch taken. Residents of the city currently have the feeling of "sitting at home with the door closed, disaster comes from the sky" or "I can't walk, brother."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Shanghai News: According to local reports, robberies of villages, ships, and cars have been occurring frequently in Jiangsu Province recently. A village in the suburbs of Wuxi on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line was surrounded and looted by more than 40 "bandits" on the 26th of last month. In mid-to-late July, multiple ship robberies occurred continuously in Shangshumiao between Jintan and Liyang, Jiangjiafang under the jurisdiction of Yixing County, Wu Ru on the Yangtze River route, and Taicang near the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. Passengers on seven ships had a great deal of money and clothing stolen. On July 23rd, two cars were also robbed one after another between Jinhua and Wujin. According to a report by Han Wenhuan, the chief of the Nationalist Capital Police Department in Nanjing, 522 theft cases occurred from January to June of this year.
