　　Brief News
    After the masses in the Shuiye District of Anyang were liberated, they automatically planned for a better life. The East, West, South, and North Streets of Chengguan began organizing cooperatives in late last month and launched a heated competition. Now, the cooperatives in each street have started business. The five cooperatives have a total of 6,609,700 yuan in shares, with 9,300 members. They have purchased two water mills, 27 cotton gins, two towel machines, two iron weaving machines, and one blanket machine to welcome the upcoming winter textile movement. Currently, the masses are continuing to invest, and under this influence, the streets outside Chengguan are also organizing cooperatives.
    Recently, the autumn crops have ripened, and the farmers are busy with the autumn harvest. Li, the political commissar of the Zhanghe Detachment, specifically called on all officers and soldiers to help the masses with harvesting. Every officer and soldier responded to the call with active actions. While stationed in Chenli Village, two companies helped the masses harvest more than ten mu of millet every day. In the past ten days, they helped harvest more than one hundred mu, and the masses were all delighted and grateful. When the unit was transferred, the masses warmly pleaded them to stay and bid them farewell.
