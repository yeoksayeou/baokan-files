　　Molotov Statement
    Polish Border Determined and Unchangeable According to Potsdam Tripartite Resolution
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] TASS, Paris, 17th: The Polish Telegraph Agency requested Molotov to express the Soviet government's view on Benes' speech in Stuttgart. In his speech on the 6th of this month, Benes implied that the decision on the Polish western border issue was not final and had the meaning of reneging on a promise. Regarding this, Molotov issued the following statement: At the Potsdam Conference, the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed that the territory east of the Oder and Neisse rivers must be placed under Polish administration, and the final determination of Poland's western border must await the peace conference dealing with Germany. This is merely the implementation of the decision of the Crimean Tripartite Conference attended by Roosevelt, which had already recognized that Poland must acquire a considerable amount of territory in the north and west. The British government also agreed to this decision. The importance of the Potsdam Conference's resolution on Poland's new border can be demonstrated by the following: the Potsdam Conference simultaneously adopted another decision – the decision to move the German people from the territory ceded to Poland to Germany. After the Potsdam Conference, the resolution began to be implemented immediately. Poland's western border along the Oder and Neisse rivers has been in place for more than a year, and the Polish government has begun its second year of administration. The Allied Control Council for Germany approved the plan to relocate German residents from Polish territory on November 20th last year for the entire area east of this line. To date, more than two million Germans have been moved from Poland to Germany, half of whom have been moved to the British occupation zone, and more than one million Poles have been moved to this area allocated to Poland, replacing the Germans who have been moved out. From the above facts, it can be seen how much importance the US, British, and Soviet governments attach to the resolution on the Polish border issue, and they have never considered making any modifications to this resolution in the future. All of this shows that the Potsdam decision signed by Truman, Attlee, and Stalin has determined the Polish border. It is only awaiting technical determination at the international conference to draft the peace treaty with Germany.

　　莫洛托夫声明
    依照波茨顿三国决议波兰边疆已确定不变
    【新华社延安二十日电】塔斯社十七日巴黎讯：波兰电讯社要求莫洛托夫关于贝纳斯在斯图加特的演说发表苏联政府的观点，贝纳斯在本月六日的演说中，曾暗示波兰西部边界问题的决定不是最后的性质，带有收回诺言的意思。关于此点，莫洛托夫发表声明如下：波茨顿会议上，美英苏三国政府元首曾同意奥得河及西尼斯河以东的领土必须归波兰管理，而波兰西疆的最后确定，必须待至处理德国的和平会议这一决定。只是实现罗斯福所参加的克里米亚三国会议的决定，后者业已承认波兰必须在北部及西部获得相当大块的领土，英国政府亦同意此决定。波茨顿会议对关于波兰新疆界决议的重要，可由下列一事证明：即波茨顿会议同时通过了另一决定——将让与波兰领土上的德国人民移至德国的决定。在波茨顿会议后，决议立即开始被执行，波兰西疆沿奥得河与西尼斯河一线已有一年多了，波政府已开始第二年管理。这一线以东整个地区的行政，去年十一月二十日盟国对德管制委员会即通过了迁移波境德国居民的计划。截至目前，德人二百余万已自波兰移至德国，其中一半移至英占领区，一百余万波人已移至这一划给波兰的地区，顶替移出的德国人。由上述事实，可以看出美英苏政府对波兰边疆问题之决议是多么重视，他们从没有对考虑在将来此决议作任何修改。这一切表明杜鲁门、艾德礼与斯大林签署的波茨顿决定，已经确定了波兰边疆。仅仅等待草拟对德和约的国际会议上予以技术方面的确定而已。
