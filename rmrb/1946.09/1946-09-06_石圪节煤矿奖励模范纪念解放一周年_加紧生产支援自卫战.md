　　Shigejie Coal Mine Rewards Model Workers, Commemorates the First Anniversary of Liberation
    Intensifies Production to Support the Self-Defense War
     "Mother of Workers" says: "If the die-hard troops come, I will fight them to the death even if it costs me my old life!"
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] All staff and workers of Lucheng's Shigejie Coal Mine are commemorating the first anniversary of the mine's liberation with the great victory of the increased production campaign since July. On August 18th of last year, when our army was besieging the mine, the workers heroically revolted from within, occupied the mine, annihilated the Japanese puppet forces, and liberated this largest machine coal mine in the Shangdang area. Wang Gengwu, the leader of the workers' uprising at that time, has now become one of the organizers and leaders of the increased production campaign. The workers jubilantly held a celebration of the first anniversary of liberation and a summary meeting of increased production. "Mother of Workers," old woman Wang, who risked her life to deliver letters during the uprising, also participated. The chairman of the trade union called on all workers to carry forward the fighting spirit of the underground army and increase production to support the victory of the self-defense war. Wang Gengwu solemnly called on everyone at the meeting to "defend our own liberated Shigejie." Old woman Wang, who is over seventy years old, also spoke excitedly: "Look how good it is now, the mine is our own, we produce more, we get rewards, and we get flowers. We must protect our mine well in the future. If the die-hards come, I will fight them to the death even if it costs me my old life!" Manager Zhang of the company reported on the summary of increased production. He said, "In July, we produced a total of 5353.8 metric tons of coal. Each worker on the pit averaged 1.12 metric tons per day, exceeding our original target of 0.8 metric tons. The amount of water in the pit decreased by 2.63 feet in 20 days, which is more than the total water reduction in April, May, and June. The drainage workers exceeded the original target by 74%. Other boiler, crane, machine fitter, and electrician workers have all completed and exceeded their tasks." He said, "This is our gift from all the staff and workers to the anniversary of liberation and the self-defense war." Finally, Xu, the chairman of the Iron Industry Improvement Association, presented awards and flowers to the model laborers. At this time, the whole audience cheered, and the applause was thunderous and lasted for a long time. In the applause, Wang Heshang, the first model worker, stood up and said, "I have been working in the kiln for 36 years, and for 35 years I have suffered for others, worrying about food and clothing all day long. But now I work for myself, and I get rewarded and praised for working harder. I have now turned over, have land, and no longer worry about food and clothing. I must speed up production and support the front line." A total of 106 people were awarded at the conference, and the bonus amounted to 300,000 yuan.

     “工人之母”说：“顽军要来，我非和他拚掉老命不可！”
    【本报长治讯】潞城石圪节煤矿全体职工以七月以来增产运动的伟大胜利，纪念该矿解放的一周年。去年八月十八日该矿工人在我军围攻时，里应外合英勇起义，占领矿山，歼灭日伪，光复了此上党地区第一大机器煤矿。当时起义的工人领袖王更务今日已成为增产运动的组织者与领导者之一。工人们兴高彩烈的召开庆祝解放一周年与增产总结大会，起义时冒死送信的“工人之母”王老太太，也参加了。工会主席，号召全体工人发扬地下军的斗争精神，提高生产以支持自卫战争的胜利。王更务在会上庄严地号召大家“保卫我们自己解放的石圪节。”七十多岁的王老太太也兴奋的讲话：“你看现在有多好，矿山是咱自己的，多生产，还得奖，还带花。以后可得好好把咱们的矿保护好，顽固要来，我非和他拚了这条老命不可。”公司张经理报告增产总结，他说：“七月份我们共出煤五千三百五十三点八公吨，坑上工每人每日平均产一·一二公吨，超过了我们原订的奋斗目标○·八公吨。二十天内坑下水量减少二尺六寸三，较四、五、六、三个月总减水量还大。排水工友超过了原订目标的百分之七十四。其他锅炉、高车、机钳工、电机工均完成与超过了任务”。他说：“这就是我们全体职工给解放纪念日和自卫战争的献礼。”最后由铁业改进会徐会长发奖，并向模范劳动者献花。此时全场欢呼，掌声雷动，经久不绝，掌声中第一名模范王和尚起立讲话说：“我下窑工作三十六年了，三十五年是给人家受苦，整天愁吃愁穿。可是现在我为自己工作，多出点力气还得奖，还受表扬。我现在已翻了身，有了土地，再不愁吃愁穿了。一定要加紧生产，支援前线。”在大会上得奖者共一百零六人，奖金达三十万元。
