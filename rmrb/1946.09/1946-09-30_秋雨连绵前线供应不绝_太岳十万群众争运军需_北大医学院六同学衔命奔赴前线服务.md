　　Autumn Rains Continue, Frontline Supplies Uninterrupted
　　Ten Thousand People in Taiyue Eagerly Transport Military Supplies
　　Six Students from Peking University Medical College Sent to the Frontline to Serve
    [This newspaper Yangcheng 26th dispatch] After the Chiang army occupied Yicheng, they engaged in frenzied looting. Under the leadership of various mass organizations, ten thousand people in Linfen, Fushan, Xiangling, Yicheng, and other counties, braving continuous autumn rains, voluntarily transported military supplies to the front line, carrying them on donkeys and poles, and also rushed to transport materials from the border areas. Some carried them on their backs, others on poles, and still others on their backs. For the past half month, the main roads have resembled bustling market fairs, with people and animals in an endless stream. Approximately seven thousand women actively participated. An old man named Guo Fuyou from Nanpo Village in Xiangling carried three dou of grain with great energy. He told people on the road, "I am sixty-three years old. The cadres were afraid I couldn't carry it, so they didn't call me. I said: The damned Chiang Kai-shek's troops are coming. If we don't quickly transport our things back, are we going to feed them to the 'dogs' (referring to the KMT troops)? I came with a burst of energy." The intense rush transport by the ten thousand people ensured that our army's combat equipment was continuously delivered to the front line, and materials from the border areas were also transported to safe zones.
    [This newspaper dispatch] Peking University Medical College dispatched six medical personnel with relatively advanced skills to the front line to serve the day after receiving the order. They all felt infinite glory and joy in accepting this mission. Many students at the medical college, some of whom were physically weak and some who had just returned from joining the emancipation teams, also requested to go. However, the quota could not be increased. They repeatedly pleaded with the school that they must go next time. On the morning of the six students' departure, the students at the school lined up to see them off, shouting the slogan "You go first! We will follow," all the way to outside the North Gate before saying goodbye.

　　秋雨连绵前线供应不绝
　　太岳十万群众争运军需
　　北大医学院六同学衔命奔赴前线服务
    【本报阳城二十六日电】蒋军侵占我翼城后，疯狂抢掠，临汾、浮山、襄陵、翼城等县十万群众在各群众团体领导之下，牵驴挑担，冒连绵秋雨，自动运送军需品上前线，并抢运边沿区的物资。驮的驮、担的担、背的背、半月来每条大路上恍若赶集赛会，人畜络绎不绝。妇女们踊跃参加者约七千人。襄陵南坡村一个叫郭富有的老汉，担了三斗粮食劲头怪大。他在路上告人说：“我六十三了，干部们怕我担不动，不叫来。我说：狗日的蒋介石队伍要来了，咱的东西不赶快运回来，还能喂了‘狗’（指顽军）吗？我一鼓劲就来了。”十万群众紧张的抢运，使我军作战器材源源运至前线，边沿区物资亦运至安全地带了。
    【本报讯】北大医学院，六位技术较为熟练之医务人员，于接到命令次日，当即奔赴前线服务。接受这个使命，他们都感到无限的光荣与愉快，医学院的不少同学，有些是身体很弱的，有些才参加翻身队回来的也都纷纷要求前往，但名额不能再增加了，他们都再三恳求校方，下次出发，一定要去。六位同学出发的早晨，在校同学列队欢送，高呼着：“你们先去吧！我们就跟上”的口号，一直送到北门外才告别。
