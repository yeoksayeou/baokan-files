　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Representatives from six major Japanese labor unions convened in Tokyo on the 12th and decided to launch a workers' strike on the 14th in response to the major strike launched by Japanese maritime workers on the 10th, as well as the railway workers' strike. The purpose of the strike is to oppose the American authorities' occupation in violation of the Potsdam Agreement, assist the Japanese reactionary government in suppressing the Japanese democratic movement, and cancel the benefits that workers are entitled to. The aforementioned unions include the National Machinery Industry Workers' Union with 156,000 members, the Coal Miners' Union with 100,000 members, and the Iron and Steel Workers' Union. According to estimates from authoritative Japanese sources, this series of strikes may trigger a nationwide general strike in Japan. From the beginning of July to September 9th this year, Japan has launched 101 strikes, involving 73,209 participants.

    日六大工会决定罢工
    【新华社延安十三日电】东京讯：日本六大工会代表十二日在东京集议，决定发动工人于十四日举行罢工，以响应日本海员工人于十日发动的大罢工以及铁路工人的罢工。罢工目的是为反对美当局占领违背波茨顿协定，协助日本反动政府压迫日本民主运动和取消工人应得利益。上述工会，包括有会员十五万六千的全国机械工业工会会员，十万的煤矿业工会及钢铁工人工会等。据日本权威方面估计，这一连串的罢工可能引起日本全国各工业的总罢工。按日本自今年七月初至九月九日止，已发动罢工一○一次，参加人数七万三千二百零九人。
