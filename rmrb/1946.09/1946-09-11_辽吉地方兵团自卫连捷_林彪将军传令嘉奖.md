This local corps has repeatedly struck invading Chiang troops in self-defense, successively recovering areas occupied by Chiang's troops after the Northeast ceasefire order of June 7th. These include: Sanmianchuan, Dagujiazi, Baijiagou, and Yemaotai within the borders of Faku in the First Sub-district; Daqingbaozi within the borders of Tieling; and Sanhe, Xiangnian, Linshan and other places in the Third Sub-district. In one month, it fought twenty battles, killing and wounding 978 Chiang troops and puppet bandits, capturing 391, and seizing 441 rifles, 2 machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, and 522 horses. The order in each recovered area is now good, and the military and civilians have high confidence in self-defense. In his commendation order, General Lin called on all soldiers and civilians to adhere to this kind of guerrilla warfare, continue to remove Chiang's troops' occupied locations, and smash Chiang's troops' new offensives.
