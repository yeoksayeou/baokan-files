　　Fifteen Years of Tragic Memories
    ——Written in Commemoration of the Fifteenth Anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident
    Yu Yifu

    Today is the fifteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. The people of Northeast China have been struggling for fifteen years. For fifteen years, the pain the Kuomintang reactionaries have inflicted on the people of Northeast China is difficult to describe in full.

    Recalling the outbreak of the "September 18th" Incident fifteen years ago, I was in Beiping. At around 12 o'clock at night, I received a phone call from outside the Guandong (Liaoning) region saying that the Japanese invaders were attacking the Beida Camp in Shenyang. I knew that this enemy attack was by no means insignificant, but we were still unsure what countermeasures to take. Inquiring with the Northeast authorities, they said they were obeying the Central Government's orders not to escalate the situation, and had already ordered the army not to resist. Although this order was reluctantly issued, the officers and soldiers below were still not convinced. Wang Yizhe, the commander of Beida Camp, expressed his indignation at this. Many soldiers of Beida Camp automatically opened fire to resist, and in many places, they spontaneously resisted the Japanese devils.

    Before this, my understanding of the Kuomintang Central Government was unclear. After a few days of the incident, the attitude of the Kuomintang Central Government became increasingly clear. The authorities were not planning how to fight Japan, but planning how to avoid conflict, begging the League of Nations for a peaceful resolution. This made my heart sink. At that time, students in Beiping, holding banners and forming large teams, surrounded Zhang Xueliang's Shuncheng Prince Mansion to protest the policy of non-resistance, but he could not solve the problem. The students then gathered in tens of thousands and took trains to Nanjing to petition, but they were beaten to the ground by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, some falling into the Qinhuai River and drowning, others with broken heads and bloody faces being escorted back. This made me even more disappointed in the Kuomintang.

    In the midst of disappointment, one day I suddenly heard from a friend in the Northeast Army who came from the Shuncheng Prince Mansion that the "Central Government" would not resist Japan, but the Jiangxi Red Army was about to send troops to resist Japan, and that 200,000 Red Army soldiers were about to set off to fight Japan. (Note: This was the spread of the news of the CCP Central Committee's call on September 22 to "resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism and organize guerrilla warfare in the Northeast.") This was like a bolt from the blue. At that time, I was still very vague about the Red Army's propositions, but I believed that fighting Japan was better than not fighting. I began to have a great liking for the Red Army.

    Then, volunteer armies rose up outside the Guandong region. Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, Wang Delin, Li Chunrun, Deng Tiemei, Feng Zhanhai, Li Haiqing, and others all organized troops to fight Japan. Famous anti-Japanese allied army leaders Zhou Baozhong, Zhao Shangzhi, Li Zhaolin, Feng Zhongyun, and other generals were all actively engaged in anti-Japanese activities there. People from the Northeast in Guannei also organized the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to support them. Zhu Qinglan and others also organized the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association as a backing. Overseas Chinese and people from all over Guannei enthusiastically donated money to the volunteer armies.

    However, Chiang Kai-shek was single-mindedly focused on fighting the civil war, willing to compromise with Japan. Watching Japan establish "Manchukuo" in the Northeast, where the people of the Northeast were fighting bloody battles, he still chanted "Internal pacification must precede external resistance," ending the Shanghai War of Resistance. The Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and the Volunteer Army Support Association and other anti-Japanese organizations in Beiping were all disbanded.

    The most obvious was the outbreak of the Rehe (Jehol) War in 1933, when the flames of war spread to the Gubeikou area of the Great Wall. At that time, the whole country hoped to persist. Zhang Xueliang held three days of meetings with Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, and others in Baoding for this purpose. Zhang advocated fighting to the end, while Chiang insisted on non-resistance, thus dismissing Zhang, handing over North China to the pro-Japanese figure He Yingqin, and thus concluding the treasonous "Tanggu Truce," tacitly recognizing "Manchukuo," ceding eastern Hebei, and even publicly declaring that his enemies "were not the Japanese bandits but the bandits." "It doesn't matter much if the three eastern provinces and Rehe are lost." (Chiang's instructions to the Central Route Army in Fuzhou on April 1, 1933). In this year, Li Haiqing, Zhao Wen, and other volunteer armies from outside the Guandong region came in and joined the Anti-Japanese Allied Army organized by Feng Yuxiang, Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, and others. At that time, young people from the Northeast who remained in Beiping also flocked to Zhangjiakou. At this time, there was no Red Army in the north, but the general public knew that the Communist Party was active in Zhangjiakou and that the Communist Party advocated resistance against Japan. However, before long, the anti-Japanese Feng Yuxiang was overthrown by the pro-Japanese He Yingqin, and Ji Hongchang was also executed on the charge of being a "Communist Party member."

    What impressed me most deeply was the opening of traffic between North China and the puppet Manchukuo on June 1, 1934, which more practically recognized "Manchukuo." An anti-Japanese youth from the Northeast was arrested by He Yingqin and executed at Tianqiao in Beiping. At that time, anyone who talked about patriotism and resistance against Japan was guilty. The general people from the Northeast who lived in Beiping secretly organized a "Restoration Society," which was also jealous of by the Third Regiment of the Military Police. Many young people who participated in the "China Armed National Self-Defense Association" organized by Soong Ching-ling and Li Du were also arrested and executed. Many people were buried in the Wangfu, the den of demons of the Third Regiment of the Military Police.

    The crisis in North China in 1935 can be said to be very tense, but Chiang Kai-shek issued an order on February 13 to "ban anti-Japanese activities" and advocated "Sino-Japanese cooperation." Mr. Du Chongyuan, a fellow villager from the Northeast, wrote an article "Idle Talk About the Emperor" in the New Life Weekly, satirizing the puppet Puyi. Chiang Kai-shek also sentenced Mr. Du Chongyuan to imprisonment. At the same time, Chiang also issued a "Good Neighborly Relations Order" on June 10 and signed the treasonous "He-Umezu Agreement" with the Japanese invaders, withdrawing the Northeast Army and others from Hebei Province, making North China even more precarious.

    At that time, Zhang Xueliang had returned from abroad, and Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Northeast Army to suppress the Communists in the border area of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, but the Northeast Army, because their hometowns had been lost, was unwilling to fight the civil war again. At this time, the Communist Party also did two earth-shattering things: one was the publication of the August 1st Declaration in 1935, calling for an end to the civil war and the organization of a united front national defense government to resist the Japanese invaders; the other was the Red Army's northward march to resist Japan, which, after the 25,000-li Long March, reached northern Shaanxi. In 1936, the Red Army crossed the river from Shaanxi to the east to resist Japan, sweeping through Shanxi. Regarding the Communist Party's anti-Japanese actions, the Kuomintang not only did not provide assistance, but instead sent a large army to intercept them. At this time, Tianjin and Beiping were shaken. No Chinese son or daughter with a little bit of enthusiasm was unmoved, especially the slogans put forward by the Communist Party, such as "Chinese people don't fight Chinese people," "Stop the civil war and unite against foreign enemies," and "Fight back to our hometown," were quickly accepted by the Northeast Army, especially the proposition of "Fight back to our hometown," which deeply touched the hearts of the people of the Northeast.

    At that time, although the Kuomintang tried every means to pull some people from the Northeast to join them, Qi Zhuying organized the "Northeast Association," Mei Foguang organized the "Northeast Youth Society," and Zhu Xien organized the "Beiqiang Society," with the north as their base of operations, but few people were willing to join them. In terms of ideology, the people of the Northeast sympathized with the Communist Party's propositions. The famous "December 9th" student movement of 1936 saw Northeast students from Northeast University and other schools standing on the front lines of anti-Japanese national salvation.

    At the same time, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army led by the Communist Party outside the Guandong region, led by Generals Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, Zhou Baozhong, and Li Zhaolin, had been fighting fiercely with the Japanese invaders in the ice and snow, persisting until the liberation of the Northeast. The history of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's struggle is an immortal heroic epic. In the past fourteen years, no one in the Northeast did not know the name of the "Red Army."

    At that time, the people of the Northeast who were exiled in Guannei saw that North China was about to become the second Northeast, so they further organized themselves, published publications, and encouraged and assisted the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army to immediately fight Japan. People from the Northeast published publications such as *The Light of the Northeast*, *Northeast Knowledge*, *Black Tide*, and *Young Women*, and organized various mass organizations. Northeast soldiers, also suffering from the pain of national destruction and family death, developed a fanatical patriotic enthusiasm, which made them recognize the truth and promoted them to fight against the Kuomintang compromise faction, thus leading to the "Xi'an Incident," forcing Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan, which was not an accident. (⑴⑵)

    It is a fact recognized by the people of the whole country that the "Xi'an Incident" led to the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident and the War of Resistance. Although the soldiers and civilians of the Northeast have made contributions to the country, they have also been despised by Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionaries as a result. Zhang Xueliang has been imprisoned and has not been released. The Northeast Army has been disbanded and divided. People from the Northeast in Guannei have been reduced to being male thieves and female prostitutes. Those outside the Guandong region have been subjected to the bloody rule of the enemy and puppets, paying food and labor, and being arrested as national affairs criminals and thought criminals. Every household has no way to live, and 40 million people have been enslaved. This is the "benevolent government" that the Kuomintang reactionaries have given us. Although the masses of the people forced Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan at that time, he still harbored ill intentions towards the Northeast and attempted to use the Northeast as a bargaining chip for compromise with Japan. The Kuomintang Provisional National Congress in 1938 publicly announced "a reasonable solution to the Northeast problem," treating the Northeast as an exception. At the National Political Council meeting in Chongqing in 1939, Mr. Wang Zhuoran, a member of the council from the Northeast, requested that the government issue a clear order to fight the war to the end and restore the state before "September 18th," but Chiang Kai-shek publicly declared to all members of the council: "The bottom line of fighting the war to the end is the final point (referring to Lugouqiao)." Chiang Kai-shek made such a fallacy, and the whole venue was in an uproar. Some friends from the Political Council were also filled with righteous indignation. At the same time, on November 18, 1939, Chiang Kai-shek also talked about "What exactly does it mean to fight the war to the end? I said at the Fifth Plenary Session that fighting the war to the end is to restore the original state before the July 7th Incident" at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Kuomintang, simply stating that they did not want our Northeast. Which person from the Northeast could not be angry? Therefore, from that time on, people from the Northeast who remained in Guannei further rose up to call for fighting the war to the end and recovering the lost territory of the Northeast. In the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in North China, Generals Lin Feng, Lü Zhengcao, Wan Yi, Zhang Xuesi, and a large number of young people from the Northeast have been working hard under the leadership of Chairman Mao to fight back to their hometowns. In addition, some democratic figures from the Northeast have been fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries' theory of selling out the Northeast and the national interests in the rear area, while the Communist Party has always advocated the slogan of "Fighting to the Yalu River," which has attracted countless men, women, and children to Yan'an and the liberated areas. Many old gentlemen from the Northeast sympathize with the Chinese Communist Party because of this proposition.

    For eight years of the War of Resistance and fourteen years since "September 18th," thanks to the Soviet Red Army's dispatch of troops to Manchuria and the struggle of the Chinese people, the Northeast was liberated. We, the people of the Northeast, have not yet settled the accounts with Chiang Kai-shek for his past sales to the Japanese invaders. After fourteen years of suffering, the people of the Northeast who have turned over a new leaf have organized democratic autonomous governments and democratic allied forces and are about to live a human life. Today, Chiang Kai-shek wants to sell the Northeast to American imperialism again, enslave the people of the Northeast with fascist dictatorial means, transport large armies to my Northeast to carry out civil war, and arrest my Northeast children everywhere, forcing them to be cannon fodder. What is most hateful is that the Kuomintang is organizing traitors, secret agents, and bandits everywhere in the Northeast. Puppet army Jiang Nipengfei, secret agent boss Shang Qiyue, and others have all become direct descendants of the Central Army. These puppet bandits are pulling livestock, robbing things, raping and plundering everywhere, causing chaos in the villages, and are truly public enemies of the people of the Northeast. We are determined to oppose such destruction of the peaceful and happy life of the people of the Northeast.

    For fifteen years, we, the people of the Northeast, have had personal experience in the struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the Northeast and the betrayal of national interests. We have recognized that only the Chinese Communist Party is the savior of the people of the Northeast and the people of China. We can only have a way out by following the Communist Party. We should use this determination to commemorate this painful day of "September 18th."

### 十五年来悲惨的回忆——为纪念“九一八”十五年而作

　　十五年来悲惨的回忆
    ——为纪念“九一八”十五年而作
    于毅夫
    今天是“九一八”十五周年，东北人民一直奋斗了十五年，十五年来，国民党反动派所给我们东北人民的痛苦是笔难尽述的。
    回忆十五年前“九一八”事变爆发时，我正在北平，夜晚十二点多钟接到关外来的电话说，日寇进攻沈阳北大营了。知道敌人这次进攻绝非小可，但是我们对策怎样，尚成疑问。询问东北当局，说是听命中央，不准把事态扩大，已经遵命叫军队不抵抗。这命令虽然勉强发下去了，但是下边官兵还是不服从，北大营的将领王以哲就对此表示愤懑，北大营的士兵很多自动开枪抵抗，很多地方都自发的和日本鬼子抵抗起来。
    在这以前，我对国民党中央还认识不清楚，事变过了几天，国民党中央的态度就越来越明显，当局不是计划怎样打日本，而是计划怎样避免冲突，哀求国联和平解决，这样使我的心就凉了半截。当时北平学生曾为反对不抵抗主义而举着大旗排着大队包围了张学良的顺承王府，他解决不了这个问题。学生们又集合成万的大队，开着火车到南京去请愿，他们又被蒋介石派队伍打的落花流水，有的掉进秦淮河淹死，有的头破血流被押解回去。这使我对国民党更加失望了。
    在失望之余，忽然有一天听见东北军一位朋友从顺承王府带来消息说：“中央”不抗日，江西红军可要出兵抗日了，听说二十万红军就要出发打日本。（按即九月二十二日中共中央号召“反抗日本帝国主义的侵略，组织东北游击战”争消息的传播）这真是晴天霹雳，我当时对红军的主张还很模糊，但是我相信只要打日本就比那不打的好，我对于红军开始有很大的好感了。
    接着关外义勇军蜂起，马占山、李杜、王德林、李春润、邓铁梅、冯占海、李海青等，都组织队伍打日本，有名的抗日联军领袖周保中、赵尚志、李兆麟、冯仲云诸将军都在那里积极进行抗日活动。关里的东北人也组织东北民众抗日救国会为声援，朱庆澜等也组织了东北义勇军后援会做后盾，海外华侨和关内各地民众都踊跃捐款给义勇军。
    但是蒋介石一心一意要打内战，甘心要和日本妥协，眼看着日本在东北成立了“满洲国”，东北人民在那里浴血苦战，他还高唱“攘外必先安内”，把上海抗战结束了，北平的东北民众抗日救国会和义勇军后援会等抗日团体都被解散了。
    最明显的是一九三三年热河战事爆发，战火伸展到长城古北口一带，当时全国人心都希望坚持下去，张学良曾为此前后在保定和蒋介石、宋子文等开了三天会，张力主打下去，蒋则力主不抵抗，因此把张撤职，把华北交给亲日派头子何应钦，从而缔结了卖国的“塘沽协定”，变相承认“满洲国”，割让了冀东，甚至公开地宣言他的敌人“不是日寇而是土匪”。“东三省热河失掉了，没有多大关系。”（一九三三年四月一日，蒋在抚州对中路军训话）这一年，关外义勇军李海青、赵文等开进来，都参加了冯玉祥、吉鸿昌、方振武等所组织的抗日同盟军，当时留在北平的东北青年也都纷纷跑到张家口，这时北方还没有红军，但是一般人民都知道张家口有共产党活动，都知道共产党是主张抗日的。可是过了不久，抗日的冯玉祥就被亲日的何应钦打倒了，吉鸿昌也以“共产党员”之罪名被枪毙了。
    给我印象最深刻的是一九三四年六月一日华北和伪满洲国的通车，更实际承认了“满洲国”。东北一个抗日青年被何应钦抓住在北平天桥枪毙了，当时说爱国谈抗日者皆有罪。住在北平的一般东北人曾秘密组织了一个“复立会”，也曾遭宪兵三团的嫉视；有许多青年参加宋庆龄、李杜组织的“中华武装民族自卫会”，也被逮捕起来枪毙了。许多人都埋身在宪兵三团魔窟的大王府。
    华北的危机到了一九三五年，可以说是很紧张了，但是蒋介石却在二月十三日下令“取缔抗日”，提倡“中日提携”，东北同乡杜重远先生在新生周刊上写了一篇文章《闲话皇帝》，讽刺傀儡溥仪，蒋介石也就把杜重远先生判处徒刑，同时蒋还在六月十日下了“敦睦邦交令”，更和日寇订了卖国的《何梅协定》，把东北军等撤出河北省，华北更是危在旦夕了。
    当日张学良已从国外回来，蒋介石就命令东北军在鄂豫皖边区剿共，但是东北军因为家乡沦陷，不愿再打内战。这时共产党又作了两件惊天动地的大事，一件是在一九三五年发表了八月一日宣言，号召停止内战，组织统一战线的国防政府，以抗击日寇；一件是红军北上抗日，经过二万五千里长征到了陕北，于一九三六年红军再由陕西渡河东上抗日，席卷山西。对于共产党的这种抗日行动，国民党不但不予援助，反而派遣大军前往堵截。这时平津震动，稍有热血的中华儿女是没有不受感动的，特别是共产党提出来“中国人不打中国人”，“停止内战一致对外”，“打回老家去”的口号，很快地就被东北军所接受，特别是“打回老家去”的主张，更深深地打动了东北人的心。
    那时国民党虽然千方百计企图拉着一些东北人跟他们一起，齐主英组织“东北协会”，梅佛光组织“东北青年学社”，朱锡恩组织“北强学社”，以北方为活动的大本营，但是很少人愿意跟他们同流合污。东北人思想上都同情共产党的主张，有名的一九三六年的“一二九”学生运动，东北大学及各校的东北学生都是站在抗日救国急先锋的岗位上。
    同时关外共产党领导的抗日联军，以杨靖宇、赵尚志、周保中、李兆麟诸将军为首，一直在冰天雪地中和日寇痛斗，一直坚持到东北解放，抗联的奋斗史是一部千古不灭的英勇史诗，过去十四年东北老百姓没有不知道“红军”的名字的。
    当时流亡关内的东北人眼看华北又要变成东北第二，大家就更进一步的组织起来，出版刊物，鼓励援助东北抗日联军马上打日本。东北人出版了《东北之光》《东北知识》《黑流》及《青年妇女》等刊物，组织了各种群众团体；东北军人亦因身受国破家亡的痛苦，产生了狂热爱国热心，使他们认识真理，推动着他们和国民党妥协派作斗争，因此产生了“西安事变”，迫令蒋介石对日抗战，这并不是一件偶然的事。（⑴⑵）
    因为有了“西安事变”才有芦沟桥抗战，这已经是全国人民公认的事实。东北军民对于国家虽然有了贡献，但也因此受到蒋介石国民党反动派的白眼，张学良被囚禁到现在还没有释放，东北军被解散分化，东北人在关内弄到男的为盗，女的为娼的地步。在关外的，则受敌伪血腥统治，缴纳出存粮出劳工，还被抓做国事犯思想犯，家家户户不得活，四千万人民都作了奴隶。这就是国民党反动派所给予我们的“德政”。虽然在那时人民大众逼得蒋介石抗战了，他还是对东北不怀好意，企图以东北为对日妥协的交换条件。一九三八年国民党临时全国代表大会，竟公开宣布“以东北问题之合理解决”，把东北看成例外。一九三九年重庆国民参政会开会，东北籍参政员王卓然先生请政府明令规定抗战到底恢复“九一八”以前状态，但蒋介石竟对全体参政员公开宣称：“抗战到底的底就是最后关头的关（意指芦沟桥）。蒋介石发表这样的谬论，全场为之哗然。一些参政会的朋友们也莫不义愤填胸，同时民国二十八年十一月十八日蒋介石在国民党六中全会第六次会议上，也谈：“所谓抗战到底究竟是怎样讲呢？我在五中全会说过，抗战到底就是要恢复七七事变以前的原状”，对于我们东北干脆表示不要了，只要是东北人谁能不愤怒呢？所以从那时起，留居关内的东北人更加奋起呼吁抗战到底，收复东北失地。在华北敌后抗战的林枫、吕正操、万毅、张学思诸将军和大批东北青年，一直在毛主席领导下艰苦奋斗到打回老家来。另外一些东北的民主人士，则一直在大后方和国民党反动派出卖东北出卖民族的理论作斗争，而共产党一直主张“打到鸭绿江边”的口号，这六个字不知吸收了多少男女老少到延安去，到解放区去，多少东北老先生同情中国共产党，这就是为了这一主张。
    抗战八年，“九一八”十四年，由于苏联红军出兵满洲，由于中国人民的奋斗，解放了东北，对于蒋介石过去向日寇出卖的账，我们东北人民还没有和他算清，东北人经过十四年的苦难，方在翻身的东北人民已经组织了民主自治政府和民主联军，正要过着人的生活，今天蒋介石又想把东北向美帝国主义出卖，用法西斯专制手段奴役东北人民，运大兵到我东北进行内战，到处逮捕我东北子弟，强迫他们去当炮灰。最使人痛恨的是国民党在东北到处组织汉奸特务土匪，伪军姜逆鹏飞、特务头子尚其悦等等都成了中央军的嫡系。这些伪匪到处拉牲口、抢东西、奸淫掳掠闾井骚然，实为东北人民的公敌。这样破坏我东北人民的和平幸福生活，我们是誓死要加以反对的。
    十五年来，我们东北人民对蒋介石出卖东北出卖民族利益的斗争已经有了亲身的体验，我们认清了只有中国共产党才是东北人民和中国人民的救星，我们只有跟着共产党走才有出路，我们应该以此决心纪念“九一八”这一惨痛的日子。
