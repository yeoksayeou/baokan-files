    Taihang Launches a Blitz to Compost Manure and Plant Wheat
    Wuxiang Women Scour the Fields to Cut Artemisia; Pingshun's Fertilizer Accumulation Exceeds Original Plan
    [Report from This Newspaper in Changzhi] "Launch a blitz to make fertilizer and prepare to plant wheat, to lay the cornerstone for next year's great production movement!" A campaign to cut Artemisia and accumulate fertilizer is sweeping through Taihang. In Shi Weng Village, Second District of Wuxiang, women from all natural villages, under the leadership of the Women's Salvation Association secretary, are competing to cut Artemisia. From Jili Ping to Shi Weng Village, for more than two *li*, women cutting Artemisia are everywhere. In three days, they cut a total of 24,800 *jin*, plus other cattle and sheep manure, enough to apply 90 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu*. Seventeen women from Dong Nie Village, Fourth District, cut 90 bundles of Artemisia in five days and are now planning to accumulate fertilizer by groups. In Wang Zhuang Village, First District of Pingshun, after eleven days of concentrated effort, all 37 full and semi-laborers in the village cut a total of 6,857 bundles of Artemisia, equivalent to more than 554,000 *jin*, and also cut 16,700 *jin* of Artemisia for families of soldiers. After the selection of model workers, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. They engaged in heated discussions, formulated a wheat planting plan for the entire village, and decided to plant all No. 169 wheat. The wheat fields will be carefully cultivated and more processed. All wheat fields in the village will be plowed three times, with 1,000 *jin* of Artemisia fertilizer and 15 *dan* of pen manure applied per *mu*. All wheat fields in the village have now been planted. In Xigou, Second District, under the leadership of labor hero Li Shunda, after summarizing the summer harvest and weeding work, they promptly formulated a plan to cut Artemisia and accumulate fertilizer. On average, each full laborer cut 77 bundles of Artemisia. With each bundle weighing 80 *jin*, this amounts to about 6,760 *jin*. The entire ditch has a total of seventy full and semi-laborers, and they have now exceeded the original plan by 490 bundles. Together with other sheep manure, donkey, cattle, and pig pen manure, the average fertilizer application per *mu* next year will be 110 *dan*. The villages in the Fourth District responded to the call of the District Office to "increase Artemisia fertilizer by 5 *dan* per *mu* and for each laborer to complete 61 *dan*." In Deheng Village, 228 laborers made 14,000 *dan* of Artemisia fertilizer in two and a half days, enough to apply 40 *dan* per *mu* of wheat field. In Ke Lao @ Village, cadres implemented a division of labor leadership. The original plan was for each laborer to cut five bundles of Artemisia per day, but the result was that each person cut an average of ten bundles per day. In Beihe Village, Second District of Changzhi, a total of thirty-six mutual aid teams, large and small, with 195 people, cut a total of 213,000 *jin* of Artemisia in five days at the end of last month, and voluntarily cut more than 10,000 *jin* for families of soldiers. They plan to complete the wheat planting plan on the 15th. In Yantouling, Sixth District of Licheng, under the influence of labor hero Wang Tonghui, the average fertilizer application per *mu* in the entire village can be 50 loads, and they are still cutting Artemisia and accumulating fertilizer during the gaps between weeding and the autumn harvest, preparing to welcome next year's great production movement.
