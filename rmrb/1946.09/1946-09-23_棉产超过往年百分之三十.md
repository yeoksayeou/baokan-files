　　Cotton Production Exceeds Previous Years by Thirty Percent
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 18th dispatch] Under the slogan of "grow your own cotton, spin your own yarn, weave your own cloth, and wear your own clothes," Yangcheng County planted a total of 34,160 mu of cotton this year, more than two and a half times that of last year. Due to intensive cultivation, the yield has been greatly increased. It is estimated that the average yield per mu will be 20 jin of clean cotton, exceeding last year's yield by 30 percent, with a total output of 683,880 jin. Based on the county's population of 200,000, the average harvest per person will be 3.5 jin of cotton. With the widespread and large-scale planting of cotton throughout the county, women are generally organized for spinning and weaving in various villages. Currently, there are 38,000 spinners in the county, estimated to weave 285,000 bolts of cloth annually, which will solve the clothing problem for the entire county of Yangcheng. At present, cooperatives in various villages are actively improving spinning and weaving tools, and the use of hand-pulled looms is very common.
