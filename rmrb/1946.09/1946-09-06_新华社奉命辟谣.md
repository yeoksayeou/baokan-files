　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Xinhua News Agency is ordered to declare: The Central News Agency's Nanjing dispatch of August 31st, regarding the so-called work program for the Liberated Areas stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, like the so-called resolution of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China previously published by the same agency, is a completely shameless fabrication by that rumor-mongering organization.

    【新华社延安三日电】新华社奉命声明：中央社南京八月三十一日电，所谓中共中央规定的解放区目前工作大纲，与以前该社所发表的所谓中共中央政治局决议一样，完全是该造谣机关的无耻捏造。
