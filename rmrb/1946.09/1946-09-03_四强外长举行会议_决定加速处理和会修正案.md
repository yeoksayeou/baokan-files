Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Paris dispatch: The four-power foreign ministers' meeting was held at 4:00 PM yesterday in French Foreign Minister Bidault's private office, lasting several hours. Each foreign minister only brought two advisors and necessary interpreters to attend. Molotov attended with Vyshinsky and Gusev, Bevin's assistants were Feakins and Jebb, Bidault's advisor was Ma Mouville, and Byrnes attended with advisors Connally and Vandenberg.

Regarding the establishment of an institution to expedite the processing of various amendments to the peace conference, the foreign ministers' meeting has reached an agreement. The original text of this agreement is as follows: "The four foreign ministers should instruct their assistant foreign ministers to study various amendments and new proposals submitted by the peace conference representatives or allied nations and former enemy states, in order to discover whether some amendments should gain the support of the members of the Foreign Ministers Committee. The Foreign Ministers Committee will hold informal meetings to try to resolve any differences of opinion in the case of the aforementioned amendments and new proposals, and to approve the recommendations of the assistant foreign ministers. If any differences of opinion arise among them regarding amendments, the members of the Foreign Ministers Committee should support the agreed-upon treaty clauses, but at the same time retain the freedom to vote on unresolved issues." The four foreign ministers also unanimously agreed that Bidault should convene the next meeting when the assistant foreign ministers have made sufficient progress on the amendments and another meeting is needed. The four foreign ministers instructed their assistants to meet on the morning of the 30th and suggested the time for the next meeting. The four foreign ministers did not reach an agreement on the issue of the United Nations General Assembly session schedule.
