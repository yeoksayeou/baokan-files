　　Bo'ai Summarizes Half-Year Mass Movement
    Peasants Recover 20,000 Mu of Land
    Main Experience is Arming the Masses to Defend Their Emancipation

    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] Bo'ai recently summarized the mass movement that began on November 15th of last year, drawing two main experiences. First, arming the masses to suppress the rule of black guns opened up the situation, and the struggle of the armed masses against the rule of black guns was consistently implemented throughout the movement. At the beginning of the movement, four members of the farmers' association in Xuliang Town were shot dead by black guns in one night. The leadership immediately organized a memorial service and publicly buried the deceased to support the masses. At the same time, it emphasized "arming ourselves to achieve emancipation," establishing a five-household joint defense system, and launching a mass anti-traitor movement. Finally, a strong militia of 1,500 people was organized, seizing 2,000 hidden machine guns, pistols, rifles, etc. from traitors, bandits, and local bullies, arming themselves, and defending the emancipation movement. Second, the cadres transitioned from not letting go to letting go. In the beginning, many cadres thought that "the people of northern Henan are slippery and unreliable" and did not trust the masses. The masses voluntarily sought out work personnel to request struggle sessions, but the reply was: "You go back first, and I'll go when I have time." The movement showed sluggishness and weakness. After gaining experience in boldly letting go in Nanwang Village, it was used to guide other villages, and the movement developed better. After seven months of movement, except for 30 backward villages that had only experienced one or two struggle sessions, most villages have moved into a stage of in-depth movement. According to incomplete statistics from five districts (1, 4, 5, and 6), peasants have legally recovered more than 20,000 mu of their own land, more than 58,000 jin of grain, more than 500 houses, more than 7.19 million yuan in currency, and also recovered 1,513 documents and 49 head of livestock.

　　博爱总结半年群运
    农民收回土地二万亩
    主要经验为武装群众保卫翻身
    【本报长治讯】博爱最近总结自去年十一月十五日开始的群众运动时，得出两点主要经验，首先是武装群众，镇压黑枪统治打开局面，又在运动中始终贯彻群众武装反对黑枪统治的斗争。运动开始时，许良镇一夜间有农会会员四人被黑枪打死。领导上一面即时组织追悼大会，公葬死者为群众撑腰，一面强调提出“武装起来翻身”建立五家连环保，发动群众性的除奸运动，终于打开了局面，组织了一支一千五百人的坚强民兵，收缴了汉奸、土匪、恶霸暗藏的机枪、手枪、步枪等两千支，武装自己，保卫了翻身运动。其次是干部由不放手到放手的转变。开始许多干部以为“豫北民性滑，不可靠”不相信群众。群众自动找工作员要求斗争，但答复是：“你先回去吧，等我去了再说”。运动表现了迟缓无力，在南王村取得了大胆放手经验后，用以指导各村，运动才较好的开展起来。经过七个月的运动，全县除三十个落后村只斗争过一两次外，大部村庄已走向深入运动阶段。据五个区（一、四、五、六）、不完全统计，农民依法收回自己的土地两万余亩，粮食五万八千多斤，房子五百多间，钱七百十九万余元，并收回文契一千五百十三张，牲口四十九头。（周波）
