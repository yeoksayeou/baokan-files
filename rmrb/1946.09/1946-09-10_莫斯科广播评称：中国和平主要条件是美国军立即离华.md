　　Moscow Broadcast Comments:
    The Main Condition for Peace in China is the Immediate Withdrawal of US Troops from China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th] Moscow Radio today broadcast: Commentator Dr. Leni, discussing the Chinese situation, stated: The withdrawal of American troops from Chinese territory is the main condition for a peaceful resolution of China's unified and democratic development. Dr. Leni stated: The scale of the civil war provoked by the Kuomintang reactionaries is expanding daily. According to Zhou Enlai's statement, this is unprecedented in the last twenty years. Dr. Leni rebuked the Kuomintang reactionaries' demand that the Communist Party withdraw from certain liberated areas as undermining the KMT-CPC negotiations and being completely unreasonable. Regarding the prospects for the current negotiations, Leni estimated that it would be difficult to reach an agreement if the Chinese government remained under the control of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Leni continued: Recently, the United States sold surplus materials of the US military in the Pacific and within China to the Chinese Marine Corps, and has maintained a long-term presence in China. This is how the United States is helping the Kuomintang spread and expand the Chinese civil war and interfering in China's internal affairs. Dr. Leni concluded: The withdrawal of American troops from Chinese territory, the implementation of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers' resolution on China, opposition to civil war, and opposition to interference, are the unanimous demands of current Chinese and international democratic public opinion.

　　莫斯科广播评称：
    中国和平主要条件是美国军立即离华
    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员列尼博士论中国时局称：撤退中国境内的美国军队，是和平解决中国统一民主发展的主要条件。列尼博士称：国民党反动派所挑起的内战规模日益扩大，据周恩来声明，这是最近二十年来空前所未有。列尼博士斥责国民党反动派之要求共产党退出某些解放区，乃是破坏国共谈判，毫无理由。列尼关于目前谈判的前途，估计很难有希望达到协议，如果中国政府仍然操纵在国民党反动派手里。列尼继称：最近美国将太平洋与中国境内美军剩余物资卖于中国海军陆战队，并长期驻在中国，这就是美国帮助国民党蔓延扩大中国内战与干涉中国内政的方式。列尼博士结语称：撤退中国境内的美军，执行三外长莫斯科会议关于中国的决议，反对内战与反对干涉，这是目前中国与国际民主舆论的一致要求。
