    Yan'an Cultural Circles Prepare to Publish "Yan'an Life"
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Handan on the 5th] Zhao Shuli, the author of *Li Youcai's Rhymes*, and comrades throughout the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region who love literary work, recently read Mr. Guo Moruo's letter "To Friends in the North" and were extremely excited. They sent a telegram to Mr. Guo Moruo to express their gratitude. The telegram stated: "We are deeply encouraged, and our confidence is greatly increased. In the future, we will certainly strive harder. As you said, there are moving deeds everywhere in our liberated areas in recent years. Unfortunately, we all lack the ability to write. In the past, due to the anti-mopping-up operations, and now due to the anti-civil war, it is not only difficult to write complete works, but even recording materials is inevitably incomplete. If you can mobilize writers from the rear to come to the liberated areas to write together and collect widely, so as not to bury the deeds of heroes and the creations of the masses, we would be even more eager to welcome them."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] The Yan'an branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles have recently decided to publish the "Yan'an Life" series. The series will include all aspects of life in Yan'an society. The form of the articles is not limited. Li Bozhao, Ouyang Shan, Zhang Zhongshi, Ai Siqi, and Ke Zhongping have been selected to form an editorial board of seven members, with Ouyang Shan as the editor-in-chief. The "Yan'an Literature and Art Monthly" (also the journal of the Yan'an branch of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles), planned by Yan'an literary and art circles, is scheduled to be published on Double Tenth Day. The journal will be edited by an eleven-member editorial board composed of Li Bozhao, Hu Man, Ouyang Shan, He Luting, and Ke Zhongping, with Ke Zhongping as the editor-in-chief. It is planned to contain 40,000 to 50,000 characters per issue, mainly targeting primary school teachers, local theater troupes, and middle school students in the border region. Furthermore, the "Wu Manyou Chorus" has been written by Kong Jue and Yuan Jing. The chorus includes nine songs: *Fleeing Famine*, *Song of Blood and Sweat*, *Prison*, *Turning Over*, *Red Flag Flying*, *Mountain Village Tune*, *Flowers Blooming Everywhere*, *Ode to Chairman Mao*, and *Learn from Wu Manyou*. The music has been composed by Meng Bo and Lu Su.
