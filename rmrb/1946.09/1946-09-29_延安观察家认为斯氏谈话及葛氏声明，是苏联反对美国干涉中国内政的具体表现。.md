　　Stalin's talks and Gromyko's statement are concrete manifestations of the Soviet Union's opposition to American interference in China's internal affairs.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] Stalin's talks and Gromyko's statement have aroused close attention from all circles in China. Yan'an observers believe that Stalin's talks and Gromyko's statement are a concrete manifestation of the Soviet Union's insistence on faithfully implementing the resolutions of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers and consistently opposing the US authorities' interference in China's internal affairs. At the same time, it is also a powerful support from the Soviet Union to the Chinese, British and American people's movement demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China and the movement to defend world peace. However, it has aroused different feelings among a small number of pro-war elements in China who rely on the United States for their livelihood. Liu Kai, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kuomintang government, issued a statement on the 25th expressing his utmost gratitude for the stationing of US troops in China, saying that the stationing of US troops in China "is the obligation of an ally in the China war zone" and that he "does not know how the stationing of US troops in China would cause international friction." Liu Kai's statement reflects how slavish the Kuomintang authorities are, willing to sell out the sovereignty of the motherland for the sake of internal war and dictatorship, without the slightest Chinese flavor.

　　斯氏谈话及葛氏声明，是苏联反对美国干涉中国内政的具体表现。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】斯大林谈话及葛罗米柯声明，已引起中国各界人士之密切注意。延安观察家认为斯氏谈话及葛氏声明乃是苏联坚持忠实执行莫斯科三外长会议决议与一贯反对美国当局干涉中国内政的具体表现，同时也是苏联对中、英、美三国人民要求美军离华运动及保卫世界和平运动的有力支援，但对之中国少数依靠美国生活的好战分子却引起不同的感觉。国民党政府外交部次长刘锴二十五日的声明对美军的驻华表示五体投地感激莫名，他说美军驻华“为中国战区同盟国一员之义务”，“不知道美军驻华如何会引起国际的磨擦。”刘锴的声明反映国民党当局是如何的奴性十足，为了内战独裁而不惜出卖祖国主权，没有丝毫中国人的气味。
