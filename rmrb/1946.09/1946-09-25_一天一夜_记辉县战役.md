　　One Day and One Night
    A Record of the Huixian Campaign
    Dong Shimin
    On the night of August 22nd, the call to defend ourselves resounded in the suburbs of Huixian. Our soldiers all remembered very clearly: this city was liberated by our army from the Japanese invaders last year, and then forcibly occupied by the Kuomintang army. Everyone concentrated their hatred on the tips of their bayonets, ready to cut into the heart of the enemy.
    One
    To dig out the enemy's heart, one must penetrate thirty *li* - Xiguan. This thirty *li* journey is not easy. It must pass through many strongholds, bunkers, and bridgeheads. The situation is extremely difficult, but we did not let the difficulties prevent us from having confidence in our advance. On the contrary, we were very active. The hero of killing the enemy, the sixth company commander Xue Liming, left his watch and money to the quartermaster in the rear, determined to die. Cui Xiaomao, the platoon leader of the fifth company, wrote a letter to the political department before departure. He said, "I have no other requirements. I am willing to sacrifice myself, but I hope that my body can be brought back after death!" Jiu Zhusan, the squad leader of the third company, said: "After I die, please allow the Party to make me a member." Many people were determined, handed over their personal belongings, and tidied up neatly, ready to cut into the enemy.
    At dusk, we set off,窜过 through the cornfields and under the bunkers. As we approached the enemy, their artillery fire was very fierce, and we drilled through the fire net. The blockade on the bridgehead was too tight to pass through. Seeing four or five people fall down, but time did not allow us to widen the distance, everyone advanced, wanting to rush in immediately. We had to crawl through the water and rice fields, with only our heads exposed. Even so difficult, we lit a red ball (signal gun) in the sky of Xiguan. This red ball encouraged the soldiers in the mud. Everyone knew that the enemy's mountain guns had been seized.
    Two
    Dawn broke, and two American-style planes appeared overhead, marked with "Blue Sky White Sun", with flames shooting straight out of the tail. The ridges of the houses in Xiguan fell one by one. The four mountain guns and six mortars on the west city fired non-stop. The mountain guns destroyed one bunker after another along the outside of the pass, and the mortars destroyed one house after another next to each other. Every corner of the streets and alleys was filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the smoke covered the sky, making it almost impossible to see people on the opposite side. The number of shells was impossible to calculate how many were fired per minute. The soldiers crawling in the fortifications could no longer distinguish the sound of artillery shells from grenades, and could not even hear when the planes came and went. At the same time, four armored vehicles and two battalions of infantry moved from the southwest and northwest, and it seemed that they had cut off our retreat. Was the situation tense? No, nothing. The second company was still cooking mule meat, and the tenth company was still slaughtering pigs. The soldiers in the fortifications were completely focused on monitoring the direction, quietly waiting to give the enemy grenades when they approached.
    The enemy came fiercely, but each time they rushed over, they were beaten back by a row of grenades. Once, twice... six times. Our grenades were gone, and there were fewer people, so we picked up the enemy's grenades everywhere and supplemented the prisoners into the squad, still holding on. Finally, the enemy entered the east village entrance, occupied a few houses, and blocked three soldiers of the seventh company in the courtyard. Six idiots climbed on the roof, and one hid under the leaves on the roof slope and shouted: "Comrades of the Eighth Route Army, hand over your guns! Hand over your guns and you will be treated leniently." Only shouting, without the courage to come down. At first, they shouted while crawling, then sitting, and then standing up and shouting. The three soldiers below were angry but had no ammunition, so they could only hold their bayonets tightly and wait. Ma Fuyuan, the squad leader of the first company next door, heard it, very surprised and angry. He climbed up the wall and saw the person standing on the opposite roof slope, shouting and urinating down the roof slope. Bah! What a hateful thing! Fuyuan took a breath and shot. The man fell backward. Immediately, he heard the sound of jumping on the roof. The soldiers who were blocked in the courtyard shouted and rushed to the back of the house, and Zhang Xiaodui's voice also came out: "Catch them alive, catch them alive." He almost didn't catch the machine gun, and hugged back an ammunition hand.
    Three
    At the next moment, the firm and tenacious lips of the East Battalion Commander inspired the battlefield: "Resolutely counterattack and take back the lost position! We will die in a pile," His words moved every soldier, and the words immediately turned into an irresistible force. Zhang Xiaodui shouted loudly: "Comrades: charge up!" Tang Chunshan said: "Yes, we will die in a pile." He carried a machine gun from the intersection all the way to the south street entrance. The instructor told him: "Good comrade, block this street." He said: "Don't worry, I will be responsible if this street is lost." Ma Fuyuan didn't say anything, but thought to himself, we are a Communist Party team, and Communists must rush forward bravely. He still walked forward from the dug-through road.
    Passing through a courtyard, he钻进 a small door and met the enemy. The enemy retreated two steps. He hid behind the wall and threw a grenade over. Just listen to 快快…………wait for me. When he caught up, he couldn't even see the ghost. A bloodstain was sprinkled all over the road. Following the bloodstain, he went to the small door at the entrance of the neighboring village. Looking outside, there was a machine gun架着. When Jin Xirui was shooting at the door, he was knocked down by a shuttle. Xiaodui saw that Xirui had fallen and followed him. Fuyuan hugged him over: "Comrade, pay attention to your posture. See how Xirui died." He threw two bombs out with the smoke. The enemy ran away and chased all the way to the surrounding wall. Look! How bad the enemy is! How good our machine guns are! How碎 the炸彈炸 is! There are countless enemy corpses! No one pulled the 彩号! They窜 all over the ground like sheep! Those who run slowly are either killed or captured alive. This time they缩回去, the enemy will never come again!
    At dusk, we pulled mountain guns, rode warhorses, and moved countless trophies in rows and rows out of the battle.

　　一天一夜
    记辉县战役
    董世民
    八月二十二日的夜晚，辉县城郊响起了自卫的号声，我们的战士，个个都很清楚地记得：这座城是我军去年从日寇手里解放，以后又被国民党军队强占去的，每个人都把他们的愤恨集中在刺刀尖上，准备向敌人的心脏开刀。
    一
    要挖敌人的心，必须深入三十里地方——西关，这三十里路程不是好走的，是要经过很多据点、碉堡、桥头，形势极端困难，但我们并未因困难而阻止了前进的信心，相反很积极，杀敌英雄六连长薛理明把表、钱都给事务长丢在后边，抱定必死决心，五连一排长崔小毛临出发前给政治处来了一封信，他说：“我别的要求没有，我情愿牺牲，但愿在死后能把尸首拉回去！”三连一班长咎祝三说：“我死后请党允许我成为党员。”很多人都下了决心，交出自己私人东西，收拾的利利落落，要向敌人开刀。
    黄昏，我们出发了，从玉茭地里，碉堡下窜过，当接近敌人时，敌人的炮火已打的很猛，我们就在火网里钻，桥头上封锁的太紧，没法通过，眼看躺倒了四五个，可是时间不允许拉开距离，个个前进，要的是马上突进去，只好从水里稻田里，光露出个头爬着走，就这样难，我们在西关的天空，打起一颗红球（信号枪）这颗红球鼓舞了泥水里的战士，大家都知道把敌人的山炮缴获了。
    二
    天亮了，头顶出现两架美式飞机，上边标着“青天白日”，机尾直冒火星，西关的屋脊一排一排倒了，西城上四门山炮，六门迫击炮不换班的发射，山炮沿着关外的碉堡摧毁一个又一个，迫击炮挨着房屋炸毁一间又一所，大街小巷每个角落散满了火药味，烟雾罩天，几乎对面看不见人，炮弹之多，无法计算每分钟发射多少，爬在工事里的战士已分不出炮弹手榴弹的声音，更听不见飞机何时来何时走，同时从西南，西北运动过来四辆装甲车，二个营的步兵，眼看把我们的来路截断了，情况很紧吗？不，没有什么，二连还在煮骡肉，十连还在杀猪，工事里的战士两只眼睛完全注意在监视方向，静静的等待，等敌人接近时给他手榴弹吃。
    敌人来势凶凶，但每次冲过来都被一排手榴弹打回去了，一次、二次……六次，我们手榴弹光了，人员少了，于是到处捡敌人的手榴弹，把俘掳补充到班里，仍然坚守着，最后敌人进东村口，占了几间房屋，把七连三个战士也堵在院里，六个蠢货爬在房上，一个躲在房坡树叶下喊：“八路同志交枪吧！交枪优待”，光喊没有勇气下来，起初是爬着喊，坐着喊，后来又站起来喊，下边三个战士干生气没有弹药，只能紧紧握着刺刀等待，隔壁一连班长马福元听见，很警讶，很生气，爬上墙头一看，对面房坡站着那人，一边喊一边顺房坡小便下来，呵！好可恶东西！福元闲着口气，一枪过去，那个人仰头倒下去了，随即听见跳房声音，被堵在院里的战士，一个杀声冲到房后，张小堆的喊声也出来了：“捉活的、捉活的”差一点机枪未抓住，搂回一个弹药手。
    三
    下一点时刻，东营长坚毅顽强的口唇，振奋了战场：“坚决反扑过去，把失掉的阵地夺回来呀！我们死也死在一堆，”他这句话打动了每个战士，话语马上变成不可抵拒的力量，张小堆大声喊：“同志们：冲上去呀！”唐春山说：“对，我们死也死在一堆，”掮着机枪从十字街一直打到南街口，指导员吩咐他：“好同志封锁好这条街，”他说：“放心，这条街失掉由我负责，”马福元没啃气，心里惦惦想，我们是共产党队伍，共产党员要勇猛扑上去，他仍从挖通的道路向前走去。
    经过一个院子，一钻小门和敌人碰了头，敌人退回两步，他躲在墙根，顺手扔过手榴弹，只听快快…………等等我，当追上时，鬼影也看不见，一道血迹沿路洒遍，顺血迹追去，到临村口小门一望，外边架着一挺机枪，靳喜锐迎门打枪时，被一梭打倒了，小堆看喜锐倒了，跟步上去，福元一把搂他过来：“同志注意姿势，看喜锐是怎死的，”说话扔出两颗炸弹顺烟冲出去，敌人跑了，一直追到围墙边，看吧！敌人是多么糟糕，我们的机枪打的多好！炸弹炸的多碎！敌人尸体数不清呀！彩号没人拉呀！和羊一样满地里窜吧！跑的慢的不是打死就是活捉，这一次缩回去，敌人再也不来了！
    黄昏，我们拉着山炮，骑着战马，搬着数不清胜利品一列一列撤出了战斗。
