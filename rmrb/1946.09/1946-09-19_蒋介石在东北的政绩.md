Chiang Kai-shek's Achievements in the Northeast

"Seizure" and "Acceptance" were the first "virtuous policies" of the Kuomintang after arriving in the Northeast. In cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin, "many factories and buildings had all sorts of notices pasted on their doors. Some notices barely lasted half a day before being replaced by another, while others coexisted, leaving people unsure of who the final owner was." (Shenyang Dispatch from Ta Kung Pao). In addition to the Kuomintang government and the large and small officials of the army specializing in "acceptance," relatives and associates of these officials, as long as they obtained a "Certificate of Acceptance," could also put up seals everywhere. Later, even seals were dispensed with; those with guns simply sent troops to occupy premises. Even Cao Tangsan, the Kuomintang Social Affairs Department's special envoy to the Northeast, could not help but admit, "You accept, I accept; you grab, I grab; civilians and military compete, officials and people compete; the powerful openly seize, the powerless steal in secret." Besides being swallowed up privately and transported away, the remaining factory materials were still sealed in machine rooms or warehouses. Machines and materials were already rusting and decaying. According to Qian Gong, from the recently dispatched Kuomintang "investigation team," a considerable portion of the materials in Shenyang had rotted in warehouses. As for real estate, eight or nine out of ten properties became private residences. Someone said, "Becoming a battalion commander in the Northeast means having a Western-style house." The bustling streets of major cities became venues for speculation and competition among newly arrived bureaucratic capitalists, and most of them found local merchants to act as fronts, while they themselves remained behind the scenes as bosses. Thus, signs for companies, foreign firms, and the like appeared, with "gold shops," "money shops," and "silver houses" being the most numerous. According to the people of the Northeast, this type of business only prospered after Chiang's army arrived.

The economic benefits that the people of the Northeast had gained under the democratic government were once again deprived. In Changchun, high-rise buildings that the democratic government had already allocated to the poor were completely emptied after Chiang's army arrived. The grain requisitions levied by Chiang's government in the Northeast exceeded even the "shipment quotas" of the puppet Manchukuo era, with disaster relief donations, troop support donations, banquet donations, and so on being innumerable. A "resident certificate" with a photo cost 4,000 yuan in circulating currency. In the Faku area, taxes were levied on every cart entering the city, 40 yuan for rubber tires and 60 yuan for iron tires. Buying a livestock animal also required a tax of 1,000 yuan. Sometimes the taxes and levies were more than double the price of the goods, resulting in an extreme shortage of rural labor, and half of the farmland around Shenyang was left barren. The Northeast Headquarters continued to use the old methods of the enemy and puppets, ordering "the planting of sorghum and corn is prohibited within ten kilometers on both sides of the railway." The Chiang-controlled areas of the Northeast were only some railway lines and nearby areas. Prohibiting the planting of tall crops within twenty kilometers on either side of the railway meant forcing the people to find other places to plant. The Headquarters ordered the people not to eat rice, claiming that rice was to be supplied to their civil war army. Under these various oppressions, sorghum in the Chiang-controlled areas of the Northeast had become an extremely expensive food for the people in the cities, and the vast majority of the people could only eat "inner rice" made from mixed coarse grain flour.

The second thing they did in the Northeast was to "recover" from the people all the democratic rights they had already obtained. Order "Jing Bei Can Zi No. 54" from the Shenyang Garrison Headquarters stated: "1. People are not allowed to assemble or form organizations without permission; 2. People are not allowed to march or demonstrate without permission." There, not only was the Communist Party not allowed to exist, but other parties were also not allowed to exist. In May, when three representatives of the Democratic League arrived in Shenyang, they were driven away under the threat of "not guaranteeing their personal safety." The "good citizen certificate" used by the Japanese imperialists to rule their colony in the Northeast was adopted by Chiang Kai-shek, thus depriving the people of even the most basic freedom to walk around. In August, in order to suppress the people's passive resistance to civil war conscription – desertion – Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters promulgated the ten-household joint guarantee system and issued the most barbaric "Regulations for Punishing Obstruction of Military Service," stipulating that "those who cause others to substitute for them shall be sentenced to death, and those who introduce the substitute shall be punished with the same penalty." Those who deserted or concealed desertions without reporting them would also be sentenced to imprisonment.

Fascist concentration camps were established everywhere, and anyone who demanded peace and democracy or dared to criticize or resist the oppression of the evil government was arrested and thrown into them. According to the Kuomintang's own official announcement, this type of organization was called the "Northeast Concentration Camp," which they established in Suizhong last November. Currently, the first brigade is located in Jinzhou, and the second and third brigades are located in Shenyang. The openly admitted number of people interned was 8,700, and there are still 3,800 people held now. Twenty or thirty people have died inside.

The most serious thing is that Chiang Kai-shek has brought a new national crisis to the Northeast. After Chiang's army arrived in the Northeast, not a single major traitor was dealt with. According to the "Hua Si Evening News," Zhang Haipeng, the former attendant and military officer of Pu Yi, is still living freely in Jinzhou, and a former puppet provincial governor surnamed Wang is still holding lavish banquets in Jinzhou. In August, Chiang's side even retained all able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 among the Japanese expatriates who had been sent to Shenyang from our North and East Manchuria liberated areas for repatriation. They armed 5,000 Japanese expatriates in Shenyang for use in attacking the liberated areas. Puppet soldiers and puppet officials were transformed into "Party and State" dignitaries. Even "Ta Kung Pao" admitted, "When the puppet army representatives flew over representing the national army, when the transformed puppet officials represented acceptance, some agency personnel would ask: 'Are you from inside the pass? What qualifications do you have to take over?'" (Shenyang dispatches from the newspaper on April 8-10 and 13-14). The remaining aggressive forces of the Japanese imperialists were supported by Chiang Kai-shek. In the Tonghua riot instigated by Chiang Kai-shek in February of this year, the slogan "Organize a joint Sino-Japanese government" was even put forward. "Ta Kung Pao" admitted that the Japanese became active again when the Kuomintang army arrived. In Shenyang, the Japanese plastered slogans such as "Long Live the National Army" and organized a "Sino-Japanese Friendship Association." The Japanese said, "We will be back in ten years." The Japanese naturally hope for a third world war so that they can turn the tables.

Not only that, but new forces of foreign invasion have also been brought to the Northeast by Chiang Kai-shek. Currently, Shenyang, Changchun, and other places are full of cheap and high-quality American goods, and Camel cigarettes have become the main product sold on the stalls of vendors. As early as April, a "Ta Kung Pao" reporter revealed, "Before the Soviet army had withdrawn, the eyes of international friends were focused here. As I write this, my hands are trembling and my heart is aching!" In June and August, American experts Pauley and the Sino-American Agricultural Cooperative Group arrived in the Northeast successively. Pauley declared that he wanted to develop the industry of the Northeast under the guise of "assistance."

The Chiang-occupied cities in the Northeast are filled with garbage, and the number of flies is unprecedented, so the people are threatened by "typhus" throughout the summer. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 1,700 patients in Shenyang, with nearly 1,000 deaths. In the villages under Changchun, 8,800 people died in a month. "Typhus" perfectly symbolizes Chiang Kai-shek's rule in the Northeast. It has brought misery to the people, it has brought fascist-style terror and oppression, it has brought a new threat of national subjugation, and it has made the people, who have endured fourteen years of Japanese imperialist enslavement, face an even darker crisis.

But the people's resentment and anger are also growing. A folk song in the Xizhong area says: "When the Japanese were here, we hoped for the Central Government, but the Central Government brought disaster! Grabbing grain and conscripting 'national soldiers,' turning the old into forced labor!" The common people call Chiang's army barbarians, and young people are cursing, "Son of a bitch, the barbarians are terrible!"

　　蒋介石在东北的政绩
    “劫搜”“接受”这是国民党到东北后的第一项“德政”，在沈阳、长春、吉林等城市“许多工厂和建筑物的门上，贴着五花八门的条子，有的条子怕连半天的寿命都没有，便有另外的一个条子来代替，有的并存下去，不知谁才是最后的主人。”（大公报沈阳通讯）除国民党政府及军队的大小官员专事“接收”外，与这些官员有连带关系的官亲官戚们，只要弄到一张“接受证”，也同样可以到处贴封条。后来封条也不要了，有枪杆子干脆就派兵占领，就连国民党社会部东北区特派员曹唐三也不能不承认“你也接收，我也接收，你也抢，我也抢，文与武争，官与民争，有力量者公然霸占，无力者暗中盗窃”。工厂的物资，除了被私人吞没和运走之外，剩下的仍然被封在机器房或仓库里。机器和物资已经在生锈和霉烂着。据最近国民党派去的“清查团”钱公来说：沈阳有不小一部分物资霉烂在仓库里。至于房产，则十之八九做了私人公馆。有人说：“在东北当上一个营长，都有一座洋房。”各大都市的热闹街市，成了新来的官僚资本投机逐鹿场所，而且他们多数是找到当地的商人出面，自己只是在后面作后台老板，于是什么公司、洋行等招牌就挂了出来，其中最多的要算“金店”“钱庄”和“银号”。据东北老百姓说：这行买卖是从蒋军到后才兴隆起来的。
    东北人民在民主政府所既得的经济利益，重又被剥夺了。在长春，民主政府已经分配给贫民居住的高楼大厦，蒋军到后，全部给撵了出来。蒋政府在东北的征粮摊派要超过伪满时代的“出荷”，赈灾捐、劳军捐、席筵捐等等不一而足。“居民证”贴张相片要四千元流通券，在法库一带，大车进城都要缴税，胶皮轮每辆四十元，铁轮六十元，买匹牲口亦要一千元税，有时捐税比货价还高出一倍，结果农村劳动力极度缺乏，沈阳一带农地荒芜了一半。东北行营沿用敌伪时代的老法子，命令“凡铁路两侧各十公里以内不准种植高粱和包米”。东北蒋管区只是一些铁路线及附近地方，沿铁路左右二十公里不准种高禾，叫老百姓到那里种去。行营命令禁止人民吃大米，理由是大米要供给他们的内战军队。在这种种的压榨下面，东北蒋管区以内高粱已变成城市中人民极贵的食品，绝大多数老百姓只能吃混合杂粮粉制成的“内饭”。
    他们在东北所做的第二件事，就是从人民手中“收复”人民所已经获得的一切民主权利，沈阳警备司令部的“警备参字第五四号”命令说：一、非经许可人民不准集会结社；二、非经许可不准游行示威”在那里，不仅共产党不准存在，其他党派也同样不准存在。五月间，民盟曾有三个代表到达沈阳，即被以“不保障生命安全”为恫吓赶走了。日寇对东北殖民地统治的“良民证”被蒋介石沿用下来，就这样剥夺了人民最起码的走路自由。在八月，为了镇压人民对内战征兵的消极抵抗——逃役，蒋介石东北行营颁布了十家联保连坐法，并颁发了最野蛮的“妨碍兵役治罪条例”，规定“使人顶替者处死刑，介绍顶替者同罪”。逃役或稳匿不报者亦处徒刑。
    法西斯集中营遍设各地，凡是要求和平民主，敢于批评或反抗恶政府奴役的，就被捉进去。据国民党官方自己宣布：此种组织叫做“东北集中营”，去年十一月他们到了绥中就设立了的。现在锦州设第一大队，第二、三大队设在沈阳，公开收容的数目前后有八千七百人，现在还有三千八百人，死在里面的有二三十人。
    最严重的是蒋介石给东北带来了新的民族危机。蒋军到东北后，大汉奸未办一人，据华西晚报载：溥仪的侍从武官长张逆海鹏，今天仍在锦州逍遥法外，前伪省长王某还在锦州大张筵席。八月间，蒋方竟将我北满、东满解放区送沈阳集中待遣的日侨中十八岁到四十五岁的壮丁全部留下，并在沈阳武装五千日侨，作为进攻解放区之用，伪军伪官一变而为“党国”大员。连大公报也承认“当伪军代表了国军飞来时，当摇身一变的伪官代表接受时，有些机关人员便说你是从关内来的吗？你凭什么资格来接收？”（该报四月八——十日、十三日——十四日沈阳通讯）日寇的残余侵略势力，被蒋介石扶植起来，在今年二月蒋介石策动的通化暴动，竟提出了“组织中日联合政府”的口号。大公报承认当国民党军到达时，日本人就重新活跃了。在沈阳，日本人大贴其“国军万岁”的标语，并组织了“中日友好协会”。日本人说：“过一十年我们还会回来的。”日本人自然是最希望第三次世界大战的，他们还想翻身。
    不仅如此，新的异民族的侵略势力，也被蒋介石带到东北来了，现在沈阳长春等地已充满了价廉物美的美国货，骆驼牌香烟成了小贩摊上的主要出售品。早在四月间，大公报记者就透露过：“苏军还未撤退，国际的朋友们眼光便集中在这里，我写到这里，我的手在发抖，我的心在发痛！”在六月及八月，美国的专家鲍莱、中美农合团相继到了东北，鲍莱声明要在“协助”的美名下开发东北的工业。
    蒋占东北城市中，充满了垃圾，苍蝇之多是从来没有的，因之整个夏天人民都在“虎疫”威胁之下。据不完全统计：沈阳全城患者达一千七百多人，死亡近千。长春所属各乡，一个月死了八千八百人。“虎疫”这正好象征着蒋介石在东北的统治，它带来了民不聊生，它带来了法西斯式的恐怖压迫，它带来了新的亡国的威胁，使经受了十四年日寇奴役的人民面对着更黑暗的危机。
    但是人民的愤懑和恼怒也正在生长起来，西中一带的民谣说：“日本在时盼中央，盼来中央遭了殃！抢粮抓丁当“国兵”，“老年又把劳工当！”老百姓把蒋军叫做蛮子，年青人们在骂“妈拉巴子，蛮子可坏透了”！
