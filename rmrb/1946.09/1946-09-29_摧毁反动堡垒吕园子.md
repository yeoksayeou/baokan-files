Destroying the Reactionary Fortress of Lüyuanzi

At the intersection of Cao County, Kaocheng County, and Minquan County, there was a reactionary fortress of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime – Lüyuanzi. It was known as the "Number One Family in Henan." The big landlord Cui Shaotang, who owned more than a thousand acres of land, came from this place. In the past, he even had a "Thousand Acres" plaque displayed. Villages within hundreds of miles were filled with his tenants.

In order to consolidate his feudal rule, the big landlords of Lüyuanzi colluded with Japanese imperialism, with rogue bandits and traitors, and with the Kuomintang reactionaries. Cui Shaotang was also the father-in-law of a high-ranking officer of Liu Ruming's forces.

After the War of Resistance against Japan, reactionary feudal landlords and bandit leaders such as Zhang Shengtai and Cui Zimin turned Lüyuanzi into their ideal nest. Over the years, the fortifications of Lüyuanzi had been built very solidly, with moats and barricades. Underneath the walled village inside the moats, there were three or four bunkers on each side, with machine gun nests inside. Each bunker could hold a squad of men. On top of the bunkers were sturdy ramparts, with countless small sentry towers. Tunnels were dug under the walls, connecting them together. Inside this tightly enclosed wall, more than a dozen large and small pillboxes stood towering.

The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to attack the Liberated Areas, used bandit leaders like Zhang Shengtai and Cui Zimin as their vanguard, constantly attacking and nibbling away at the Liberated Areas, coordinating with the enemy's "encirclements" and "sweeps," burning, killing, and looting without restraint. Countless anti-Japanese soldiers, militiamen, and district and village cadres were killed. The Kuomintang reactionary authorities not only did not punish these national scum, but instead appointed Zhang Shengtai as the head of the Kuomintang Kaocheng Security Regiment and concurrently the magistrate of Kaocheng County, and Cui Zimin as the brigade commander and concurrently the district chief. Other lackeys, such as Wang Maode (brigade commander), Hui Chunhe (currently represented by his younger brother), and Zhang Jinting (squad leader), were also rewarded with official positions for their "meritorious" service in colluding with the enemy, betraying the country, and killing the people. From then on, these scourges of the nation not only did not repent, but became even more rampant, attacking and harming the Liberated Areas with impunity.

After the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of this year, Zhang Shengtai, Cui Zimin, and others, under the secret command of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, launched a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas. In the twenty days after the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th, they launched a total of twelve attacks, large and small. The attack on January 20th alone is revealing. At dawn on January 20th, Zhang Shengtai gathered more than 2,000 men from Shi Fuqi's unit and advanced on the Liberated Areas in several directions. Zhang Shengtai personally commanded a force of more than 500 men, carrying five machine guns, and launched a night attack on the Longhai Detachment of our Forest Fortress. The Longhai Detachment defended itself and repelled them. Another unit, composed of Wang Shude's and Du Hongfen's forces, totaling more than 600 men, departed from Lüyuanzi and attacked our Fifth District Team of Kaocheng. Our soldier Hou Wancheng was wounded, and the district team was forced to retreat. Twenty-one houses were burned down in Liguan Village, Yang Xinde was killed, and three women were raped. Zhang himself led more than 1,000 men, accompanied by eleven machine guns, to attack the 8th Route Army ×× Regiment, but was repelled. In the afternoon, Zhang's unit attacked Dazhuang, and then combined with the second route to attack our army near Liguan again. Our army retreated step by step, and Zhang's unit pressed forward step by step, wounding five and killing one.

During our self-defense counterattack on the Longhai Railway line, Zhang Shengtai and Cui Zimin, Wang Maode and other units, continuously attacked our rear lines of communication, robbing dozens of livestock from the people. The captured civilians were buried alive or brutally murdered. Their crimes were too numerous to mention, and the people hated them with every fiber of their being.

Zhang Shengtai and Cui Zimin extorted money and harmed the people, and they became big landlords. For example, Zhang Shengtai had only two or three acres of land at the beginning of the War of Resistance against Japan. Now, no one knows exactly how much land he owns. According to the people in Lixin Village and surrounding areas, he has more than twenty acres of land just in his own village. The farmers in the surrounding villages have almost all become his tenants. How did they get their land? They had two ways: first, looting; second, levying funds. For example, if they saw someone's good land, they would levy a large sum of money on him. If he couldn't pay, he would mortgage the land or sell it to them at a low price. For example, if a piece of land was worth 6,000 yuan, they would levy 5,000 yuan on you. If you couldn't pay, you would have to mortgage it. In this way, the people's land was concentrated in their hands in large quantities. Even their relatives and friends all became big landlords in the same way.

At dawn on August 27th, a unit of our army launched a destructive attack on the bandit forces in Lüyuanzi. Our army first surrounded the stronghold completely, and then launched a fierce attack. Because they could not resist, Brigade Commander Cui Zimin led more than 200 men to break through and seek reinforcements. But what awaited them was a storm of machine gun bullets. Cui Zimin was taken prisoner. Our army released him and persuaded his subordinates. At 12:30, all the men in Lüyuanzi surrendered under the leadership of Cui Zimin. Lüyuanzi was then occupied by our army.

When Lüyuanzi was opened up, as I went from Weiwan to Lüyuanzi, the people along the way, hearing that Lüyuanzi had been captured and Zhang Shengtai's bandit forces had been completely annihilated, were all smiles, men and women, old and young, breathing a great sigh of relief. The people living inside Lüyuanzi, when the 8th Route Army entered, set up tea and water in front of every house. An old lady said repeatedly, "You have opened up Lüyuanzi, my saviors, you have truly rescued us from the abyss of misery." The destruction of Lüyuanzi has liberated hundreds of thousands of farmers in the surrounding area.

### 摧毁反动堡垒吕园子

　　摧毁反动堡垒吕园子
    在曹县、考城、民权三县的交界处，有一个蒋伪的反动堡垒——吕园子，号称河南第一家，拥有土地一千多顷的大地主崔绍堂就出在此地，过去曾挂过千顷牌，四周数百里内的村庄，都有他的佃户。
    吕园子的大地主们为了巩固他的封建统治，曾与日本帝国主义勾结，与流氓土匪汉奸勾结，与国民党反动派勾结，崔绍堂又是刘汝明某高级职员的岳丈。
    抗战以后，反动封建地主的代表兼土匪头子张盛泰、崔子民等，把吕园子当成了他们最理想的巢穴。在几年来的建筑中，吕园子的工事建筑得很坚固，有水壕、鹿砦，水壕内的围寨下面，每边都有三四个地堡，里面还筑有机关枪巢，每个地堡，可容一班人。地堡上是很坚固的围寨，围寨上有无数的小岗楼，围墙里都挖成了地道，可以互相联接起来。在这种坚固的围寨紧紧包围之中，高耸着十多个大大小小的碉堡。
    国民党反动派，为了进攻解放区，就利用张盛泰、崔子民等土匪头子，作为开路先锋，不断向解放区进攻、蚕食，并配合敌伪“合围”“扫荡”，烧杀抢掠无恶不作，杀死我抗日军人，民兵及区村干部不可计数，国民党反动当局，对此民族败类，不但未加惩办，反而委张盛泰做了国民党考城保安团团长兼考城县县长，委崔子民为大队长兼区长，其他喽罗们，如王茂德（大队长），回春和（现由其弟代职），张金庭（队长）等，也都因通敌卖国杀害人民“有功”而分得到官做，从此这些祸国殃民者，不但不知改悔，反而凶焰万丈，向解放区的进攻和残害，更是横行无忌。
    今年一月十三日停战令颁发以后，张盛泰、崔子民等，即在蒋军的秘密指挥下向解放区大举进攻，仅在一月十三日停战命令生效之后，二十天内，共计大小进攻达十二次之多，单以一月二十日的一次进攻来说，就可见一斑。一月二十日拂晓，张盛泰纠合石福起部两千余人分路进犯解放区，张盛泰亲自指挥，一路五百余人，携机枪五挺，深夜向我森林砦之陇海支队进攻，陇海支队自卫，将其击退，另一部为王树德、杜红粉部共六百余人，由吕园子出发，进攻我考城五区队，我战士侯万成负伤，区队被迫退出，李馆村被烧毁民房二十一间，打死杨心德，奸淫妇女三人，张本人亲率一千余人，附机枪十一挺，进攻八路军××团，当被击退。下午张部又进攻大庄，随后又结合二路，再度进攻李馆附近我军，我军节节退让，张部则步步进逼，被其击伤五人，亡一人。
    这次陇海线我自卫反击战中，张盛泰及崔子民、王茂德等部，又不断袭击我后方交通线，抢老百姓牲口数十头，被捉的老百姓都被其活埋或残杀，他们的罪恶事实太多了，老百姓一提起他们来无不切齿痛恨。
    张盛泰、崔子民等架票祸害老百姓，他们都变成了大地主了，如张盛泰，在抗战开始时，不过两三顷地，现在他的土地到底有多少，没有人清楚，据李辛庄一带的老百姓说，光他自己的庄上，他的地就有廿多顷，周围村庄的农民，差不多都成了他的佃户。他们的地是怎样来的呢？他们要地的办法有两种：第一是抢掠；第二是派款。比如看上了谁家的地好，就给他派上一大笔款子，拿不起就将土地作抵押，或低价卖给地。比如地能值六千元的，给你派过五千元，拿不出就押起了，老百姓的土地，就此大量集中到他的手里去了。就是他们的亲戚友朋，也同样的都成了大地主。八月二十七日拂晓我军一部开始对吕园子的土匪部队作歼灭性的打击。我军先后将据点团团围困，然后以猛烈的火力进行攻击。因为无法抵御，最后大队长崔子民率领二百余人突围，想去求援兵，但是迎接他们的是一阵暴风雨似的机关枪弹，崔子民做了俘虏，我军把他放回去，说服他的部下，十二点三十分，吕园子的全部人马，在崔子民的率领下投降了。吕园子遂被我军占领。
    当吕园子被打开的一天，我从魏湾到吕园子去的时候，一路上的老百姓，听说吕园子已被攻下，张盛泰的土匪部队，已全部歼灭，男女老幼，满脸堆笑，大大的松了一口气，住在吕园子里面的老百姓，当八路军进去的时候，家家门前都摆了茶水，有位老太太连声的说：“你们把吕园子打开了，我的救苦救难的老爷，你们真算把我们救出了火坑。”由于吕园子的摧毁，使四周几十万农民获得了解放。
