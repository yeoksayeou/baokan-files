　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. New York dispatch: Former US Vice President and Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace delivered a speech here at Madison Square on the 12th, advocating that China should be "a united and peaceful China built on the basis of cooperation among all parties and a policy of non-interference by foreign countries." He said, "World peace requires China to maintain a detached position, standing outside any sphere of influence, whether politically or economically." Wallace delivered his speech at a conference hosted by the National Citizens Political Action Committee and the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions. Speaking about US-Soviet relations, he said: "The United States cannot successfully solve problems by adopting a tough policy towards the Soviet Union. The tougher we are, the tougher the Soviet Union will be. In order to prevent war or ensure that we can survive in a stable world, it is extremely important that we observe foreign problems with our own American eyes, not with the eyes of the British Foreign Office or a pro-British or anti-Soviet newspaper. We must never allow our Soviet policy to be guided or influenced by those in the United States or abroad who hope for war with the Soviet Union. This is not appeasement. The vast majority of us hope to live in peace with the Soviet Union, but we hope for mutual concessions and compromises, we want cooperation." Wallace added, "There are many elements throughout the world who in the past hoped for a Nazi victory, and now pretend to be extremely friendly to the United States. These enemies of yesterday and false friends of today will continue to try to provoke war between the United States and the Soviet Union. They yearn for the day when the United States and the Soviet Union are both defeated." Wallace criticized Republican Governor of New York Dewey for saying that he favored forming an alliance with Britain as the basis of American foreign policy. Wallace said, "We must never let the Republican reactionary leadership force us into war." At the conference, Wallace supported Democratic Senator Mead as a candidate for Governor of New York and former Federation President Lehman as a candidate for Senator from New York. Wallace is a leader of the Democratic faction within the Democratic Party and has great influence among the American people. He has consistently advocated peaceful coexistence between the American way of life and the Soviet way of life.

　　华莱士发表演说
    反对干涉中国内政主张美苏和平共处
    【新华社延安十四日电】纽约讯：美国前副总统、商务部长华莱士，于十二日在此间麦迪逊广场发表演说，主张中国应该是“一个建立在各党派合作及外国不干涉政策的基础之上的团结与和平的中国”。他说：“世界和平需要中国保持超然的地位，无论在政治上或经济上均立于一任何势力范围之外。”华氏系在全国公民政治行动委员会及独立公民艺术科学委员会所主持的大会上发表演说，他谈及对苏关系时说：“美国不能以对苏采取强硬政策来顺利解决问题，我们愈强硬，苏联也将愈强硬，为了防止战争或保证我们能生存于一稳定的世界中。我们对国外问题，以我们自己美国人的眼光，而不是以英国外交部或一种亲英或反苏报纸的眼光来观察是极其重要的。我们绝不要让我们对苏政策为那些美国国内或国外的希望与苏联开战的人们所指导或影响。这并非绥靖，我们绝大部分人都希望与苏联和平相处，但我们希望互相让步与妥协，我们要合作。”华氏又说：“全世界有许多分子过去曾希望纳粹胜利，现在则佯装对美国极为友好，这些昨日的敌人与今日的假朋友，将继续企图挑动美苏之间的战争，他们渴望有一天美苏两国两败俱伤。”华氏抨击共和党的纽约州长杜威说他赞成与英国结成同盟，作为美国外交政策之基础。”华氏说：“我们绝不要让共和党的反动领导机关来迫使我们进入战争。”华氏在大会上支持民主党参议员米德为纽约州长候选人及前总联署长李门为纽约州参议员候选人。华莱士为民主党内的民主派领袖，在美国人民中有很大影响，他一贯主张美国生活方式和苏联的生活方式和洽共存。
