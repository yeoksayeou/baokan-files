　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaian, 20th: After inflicting heavy casualties on Chiang's army, the New Fourth Army strategically withdrew from Huaiyin on the 19th. From the 15th to the 19th, the New Fourth Army killed two regimental commanders, six battalion commanders, and over 5,000 officers and soldiers of Chiang's army, captured hundreds of prisoners, and shot down two Chiang's aircraft. Fighting is still ongoing around Huaiyin.
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaian, 21st: A special correspondent from our agency in Northern Jiangsu reports: The military situation after the New Fourth Army's strategic withdrawal from Huaiyin will put Li Yannian's twelve divisions of Chiang's army in a very awkward position, and will quickly shatter the reactionaries' reckless and arrogant boasting. The battle situation has shifted to the interior lines, and the war in Northern Jiangsu has now fully unfolded. Chiang's army's forces are increasingly dispersed, taking beatings everywhere, and their rear is even more empty, with only a few troops guarding transportation lines and strongholds. Sixian only has one regiment, and Lingbi and Wuhe each only have one battalion. The Chiang's army in northern Anhui only controls the Tianchang, Xuyi, Lai'an, Liuhe, and Wuhe line. Our morale is high, and a wave of enthusiasm exceeding the record of seven victories in seven battles in Central Jiangsu has swept through the troops. Local armed forces have successively moved behind enemy lines to contain and eliminate the enemy, and the militia are particularly active. In the Central Jiangsu area, in addition to rifles, light and heavy machine guns, the militia also have American weapons such as carbine Thompsons. They coordinate with the main forces in combat and have established many glorious achievements, mainly eliminating the "Homecoming Legions," destroying the reactionary regime colluding between Chiang and the puppets, besieging strongholds, containing and resisting small groups of Chiang's army, and conducting sabotage warfare, even to the point of capturing villages and towns. In the Songjiaqiao battle in Rugao, 2,000 Chiang's soldiers who had been captured escaped, but 1,500 of these 2,000 were captured or killed by the militia. Some militiamen used three short guns to escort 600 Chiang's army officers of captain and major rank to the interior of the liberated area, and not one escaped. There were also three small-footed women unarmed, escorting more than 200 prisoners without a single one escaping. In the Chiang's army's very empty rear, local armed forces and the militia are exerting their power. The villages and towns occupied by Chiang's army on both sides of the Wo River have all been recovered by our Xuefeng and Wo River heroes. The brave duck gun teams on Hongze Lake and the people's guerrillas in the Huaibao and Huaisi areas are powerfully dragging down Chiang's army. Wang Fengshan, a militia hero from Lianshui, seeing that the reactionaries had already struck at his feet, led his local cannon team to fight the reactionaries desperately. Now he not only has local cannons, but also landmines. The guerrilla militia on both sides of Baoying have dealt the biggest blow to Chiang's army. Since the correct implementation of the "land to the tiller" policy, the people in various parts of Central China have truly become masters of their own destiny. A large number of farm laborers, tenant farmers, and middle peasants have participated in the democratic governments at the district, township, and town levels. Now, Chiang's army is encountering the "land protection movement" launched by the broad masses of the people at every step. "Protecting the land and protecting the hometown" has become the resounding slogan of the people in the Central China liberated areas to "mobilize and crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." They are enthusiastically joining the army and participating in the war. Recently, the Fifth and Sixth Military Sub-districts have each had more than 10,000 people enlist, establishing supplementary regiments and independent regiments. The people's forces in other military sub-districts are also expanding. The people of Northern Jiangsu all believe that the adventurers who venture deep into this powerful people's sea in Northern Jiangsu will not find their paradise, but only their graves.

　　新四军主动撤离前
    淮阴近郊歼敌五千
    苏北军民普遍展开游击战蒋军轻率进犯乃自找坟墓
    【新华社淮安廿日电】新四军予蒋军以重大杀伤后，于十九日主动撤出淮阴。新四军自十五日至十九日，共毙蒋军团长二名，营长六名及以下官兵五千余人，俘掳百名，击落蒋机两架，战事仍在淮阴四周进行中。
    【新华社淮安二十一日电】本社苏北特派记者报导：新四军主动撤离淮阴以后的军事形势，将使李延年指挥的蒋军十二个师陷于十分尴尬的境地，并使反动派轻率和狂妄的鼓嘘迅速破产，战局已经转至内线，苏北战事从此全面展开。蒋军兵力益形分散，到处挨打，其后方更为空虚，只有少数部队守备交通线及据点，泗县只有一个团，灵壁、五河各只有一个营。淮北蒋军只控制天长、盱眙、来安、六合、五河一线。我方士气旺盛，部队中普遍掀起了超过苏中七战七捷纪录的热潮，各地方兵团纷纷转入敌后去牵制消灭敌人，民兵尤为活跃。苏中一带民兵除有长短枪、轻重机枪外，并有卡宾汤姆式等美国武器，他们配合主力作战，建立了许多光辉战绩，主要是消灭“还乡团”，摧毁蒋伪合流的反动政权，并围困据点，牵制与抗击小股蒋军，进行破击战，以至攻克村镇。在如皋南宋家桥战役中，被俘的蒋军曾逃跑了二千人，此二千人被民兵捉回与击毙的就一千五百人。有几个民兵用了三支短枪，押送蒋军尉校级军官六百人至解放区内地，竟无一人逃跑。还有三个徒手的小脚妇女押送俘虏二百余，而无一逃跑者。在蒋军十分空虚的后方，地方兵团和民兵正发挥其威力。涡河两岸蒋军所占村镇，已悉为我雪枫、涡河的健儿所恢复。洪泽湖上神勇的鸭枪队和淮宝，淮泗一带的人民游击队，正有力的拖住蒋军的后腿。涟水的民兵英雄王凤山，看到反动派已经打到脚边来了，就带起他的土炮队和反动派拚命，他现在不但有土炮，而且有地雷。宝应两岸的游击队民兵给蒋军打击最大。华中各地人民自正确实现“耕者有其田”政策后，真正作了自己命运的主人，大批雇农、瓮农、中农参加了区乡镇各级民主政权，现在蒋军步步遭遇广大人民所开展的“保田运动”，“保田保家乡”已成为华中解放区人民“动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻”的响亮的口号。他们风起云涌地参军参战。最近五六两分区已均有万余人入伍，成立补充团营和独立团营。其他各分区的人民队伍，亦在扩大中。苏北老百姓都相信冒险家们深入苏北这一强大无比的人民大海里，将不会找到自己的乐园，而只能找到自己的坟墓。
