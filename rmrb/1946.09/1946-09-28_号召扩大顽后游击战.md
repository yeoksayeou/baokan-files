　　Call to Expand Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 25th] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Expand Patriotic Self-Defense Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines." The article, after describing how our army and local militia and masses in southern Shanxi launched a patriotic guerrilla war from the very first day of the Chiang army's invasion of southern Shanxi, and created many brilliant examples and great achievements, stated: Why are our army and militia, with only backward weapons, able to defeat the enemy with fewer troops and continuously eliminate the Chiang army equipped with American weapons? Why can they gallop back and forth within the crisscrossing grid network as if entering an uninhabited area? How were these miracles, which stunned the Chiang and puppet troops, created? First of all, our army and militia, in order to defend the motherland, defend the liberated areas, and defend their own interests after liberation, highly demonstrated a spirit of heroism and tenacity. They worked day and night, tireless and regardless of hunger. The call to "not give up until the stubborn bandits are driven away" resounded throughout the wilderness behind enemy lines. Their determination and confidence have grown with continuous victories, so they can display creativity and be victorious in every battle, and keep the banner of independence, peace, and democracy planted in the heart of the stubborn enemy and puppets. The Chiang army is demoralized and lacks troops. The deeper they go, the larger the gaps in their rear become. For example, in the plains of Wenxi and Xiaxian, except for villages such as Yanzhang, Shangfeng, Zhongwei, and Sima, other strongholds have been forced to withdraw, and our army's maneuvering area is expanding. Secondly, the people of southern Shanxi, who have experienced many hardships, have long recognized who is good and who is bad, who is loyal and who is treacherous, from their own experiences during the eight years of resistance against Japan. The folk song "The Central Army fled to the south bank of the Yellow River, secret agents and bandits colluded with the enemy to cause trouble, and the Eighth Route Army persisted in the anti-Japanese war in southern Shanxi" is a real example. Our army in southern Shanxi has truly established an interdependent relationship with the masses. Many victorious battles of our army have been successful with the reconnaissance reports of the masses and the direct participation and cooperation of the masses. Thirdly, the people of southern Shanxi have established their own various organizations, especially the organizations of farmers' associations and militia are becoming increasingly strong, and many mass leaders have emerged. People's leaders like Jia Kangjie, who are connected with the masses by flesh and blood, are gradually growing and increasing in number. They are all native-born, have close ties with the masses, and have the determination to serve the people and sacrifice everything for them. These are the reasons for the great victory of the patriotic self-defense guerrilla war of the military and civilians in southern Shanxi. They are also favorable conditions and reliable guarantees for achieving greater victories in the future. However, with the prolongation of the entire war, the struggle in southern Shanxi will also be more protracted and cruel. Now, the Chiang army is drawing troops from Shaanxi in a desperate gamble and continuing to投入into the southern Shanxi battlefield. Therefore, a severe struggle lies ahead. Our military and civilians in southern Shanxi should give play to our glorious tradition of heroism and tenacity, make use of our favorable conditions and the weaknesses of the Chiang army, be unyielding, and respond to the recent call of the Central Bureau to strive to complete the following tasks: First, further rely on the masses, protect the interests of the masses after liberation, and lead the masses and all progressives to widely launch a movement against the stubborn army's massacres, robberies, conscription, exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous levies, and corvée. Start from the vital interests of the masses everywhere, organize and arm the masses, and expand and consolidate the militia to protect their own lives and property. Second, study and understand Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking, launch "unpredictable" guerrilla warfare, appearing and advancing, hiding and emerging, dividing and merging. Widely launch a mine warfare campaign, implement the combination of thunder and guns, organize flying explosions, strike the Chiang army's small units, destroy the stubborn enemy and puppet organizations. Disrupt transportation and intercept transportation, abandon strongholds that can be abandoned, seize opportunities to recover lost territories, and carry forward the brilliant example of the Guoli annihilation battle. Strive for initiative, strive for decisive and rapid annihilation of the enemy's vital forces. Overcome certain misunderstandings that underestimate landmines and stone mines, rely solely on machine guns and artillery, and ignore guerrilla warfare. Third, strengthen the political offensive, launch the Gao Shuxun movement against the civil war, and strive for all anti-civil war troops to come to the people's side. No matter what he was in the past, as long as he is against the civil war today, we sincerely welcome him. Our army's struggle behind the stubborn enemy and puppets is not isolated. We have the cooperation of the frontal counterattack, the cooperation of all fronts, and the cooperation of the national people's struggle. As long as we can work tirelessly and complete the above tasks, we will surely win greater victories and finally drive out the stubborn enemy and puppets and recover all the lost territories.

　　号召扩大顽后游击战
    【本报阳城廿五日电】太岳新华日报顷发表社论，题为《扩大顽后爱国自卫的游击战》，该文于叙述晋南我军及当地民兵与群众自蒋军侵犯晋南的第一天开始，即展开了爱国游击战争，并创造了很多光辉范例与伟大成绩后，称：我军及仅有落后武器的民兵、为什么能够以少胜众，不断消灭手执美国武器的蒋军呢？为什么能在纵横交错的格子网内，往返驰骋如入无人之境呢？这些使蒋伪目瞪口呆的奇迹，是怎样创造成的呢？首先我们的军队及民兵为保卫祖国保卫解放区保卫自己的翻身利益，高度发挥了英勇顽强的精神，他们日以继夜的活动，不知疲倦，不顾饥饿，“打不走顽匪誓不罢休”的呼声，响彻了整个顽后的原野。他们的决心与信心，均在不断的胜利中日益增长，故能发挥创造，百战百胜，而将独立、和平、民主的大旗一直插到顽伪的心脏，而蒋军则士气低落，兵力不足，越是深入，他后方的空隙就越大，如闻喜、夏县平川，目前除堰掌、上冯、中卫、司马等村外，其他据点均被迫撤退，我军回旋地区日益扩大。其次，饱经沧桑的晋南军民，他们于八年抗日中，早从切身经历中，认清了谁好谁坏，谁忠谁奸，“中央军逃到黄河南岸，特务土匪勾结敌人扰乱，八路军坚持汾南抗战”的民谣便是现实的例证。晋南我军真正与群众建立了相依为命的关系，我军许多胜利的战斗，都是在群众侦察报告，群众直接配合参加之下成功的。再次，晋南人民已建立起自己的各种组织，尤其是农会民兵的组织日益坚强，并涌现了许多群众领袖，象嘉康杰这样与群众血肉相联的人民领袖，逐渐生长增多，他们都是土生土长与群众有密切的连络，有为人民服务而牺牲自己一切的决心，这些便是晋南军民爱国自卫游击战获得伟大胜利的原因。也是今后将获得更大胜利的有利条件与可靠的保证。然而随着整个战争的延长，晋南斗争也将更加持久与残酷。现蒋军为作孤注一掷，正从陕西抽调部队，继续投入晋南战场上，因此，严重的斗争还在前面，我晋南军民应发挥我们英勇顽强的光辉传统，利用我们有利条件及蒋军弱点，百折不屈，再接再厉响应中央局最近的号召，努力完成下述任务：第一、进一步依靠群众，保卫群众的翻身利益，领导群众及一切进步人士，广泛展开反对顽军屠杀、抢劫、抓丁、苛捐、杂税、支差的运动。处处从群众的切身利益出发，组织与武装群众，扩大与巩固民兵，来保卫自己的生命财产。第二、学习与领会毛主席的战略战术思想，展开“神出鬼没”的游击战争，时出、时进，时隐、时现，时分、时合。广泛展开爆炸运动，实行雷枪结合，组织飞行爆炸，打击蒋军的小股部队，摧毁顽伪各种组织。破环交通截击运输，抛掉可能抛掉的据点，相机收复失地，发扬郭里歼灭战的光辉范例。争取主动、争取干脆、迅速的消灭敌人的有生力量。克服某些轻视地雷石雷，光靠机枪大炮的曲解而漠视游击战争的思想。第三、加强政治攻势，掀起反内战的高树勋运动，争取一切反内战部队到人民方面来，不管他过去怎样，只要他今天反内战，我们都竭诚欢迎，我军在顽伪后方的斗争不是孤立的，我们有正面的反击相配合，有各个战线上的配合，有全国人民斗争的配合，只要我们能努力不懈，完成上述任务，必能争取更大的胜利，最后驱逐顽伪，光复所有失地。
