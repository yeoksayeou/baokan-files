Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Mr. Zhang ＠bo, a director of Shanghai Zhongxing Industrial Company, published an article entitled "Bureaucratic Politics and Peasants" in a Shanghai newspaper on August 18, believing that peasants oppressed by the Kuomintang would rise up and overthrow bureaucratic politics. Based on the historical lessons of bureaucratic politics and peasant revolution in China, Zhang pointed out that the current Kuomintang government's bureaucratic politics has reached the point of "corruption," "incurable," and "imminent collapse." Zhang pointed out: "The Kuomintang believes that it controls the center of the city, the center of industry, commerce, and finance, and has foreign aid to rely on, so it thinks it can easily eliminate the Communist Party in a short period of time." In fact, the Kuomintang itself is "in imminent danger." The Kuomintang is difficult to obtain various U.S. military aid, but "peasant revolutions overthrowing bureaucratic politics have been common from the Qin Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, not to mention the enthusiastic and unstoppable democratic trend today." "At present, the countryside has reached the end of its rope, and the Kuomintang's oppression and exploitation have intensified (such as the in-kind collection of land taxes). Once the peasants rise up and gather in response, I am afraid that even if the American equipment is sophisticated, even using atomic bombs will lose its effectiveness."

　　沪名流张＠伯著论
    官僚政治病入膏盲
    将被农民革命推翻
    【新华社延安三日电】上海中兴实业公司董事张＠伯氏于八月十八日在沪报发表《官僚政治与农民》一文，认为被国民党压榨的农民将起而推翻官僚政治。张氏依据中国官僚政治农民革命的历史教训，指出目前国民党政府的官僚政治已到了“腐化糜烂”“病入膏盲”“崩溃横决”的地步。张氏指出：“国民党自以为把握都市的中心，掌握工商业与金融重心，又有外援可恃，以为不难在短时期内将共产党消灭。”其实国民党本身倒是“岌岌可危”。国民党难得到美国军事上的种种援助，可是“农民革命推翻官僚政治，自秦迄清，屡见不鲜，何况今日民主潮流热烈汹涌不可遏止。”“目前农村到了山穷水尽的地步，国民党的压迫和榨取又变本加厉（如田赋征实），一旦农民揭竿而起，群集响应，恐怕美式装备虽属精良，即用原子炸弹亦将失其效力矣”。
