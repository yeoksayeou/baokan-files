　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan, 30th] A comprehensive report from our frontline reporters: On the Tongpu and Longhai fronts, our army is holding ceremonies to celebrate Chiang and Yan's soldiers laying down their arms and returning home.

　　On the Tongpu front, the Eighth Route Army held a ceremony on the 27th to celebrate the return home of Yan's officers and soldiers who laid down their arms during the Hongzhao Self-Defense Campaign. The first group consisted of 265 people, all of whom were given travel expenses and passes according to the distance, so that they could return home and reunite with their families, and once again enjoy the joy of family reunion. Most of them were "bundled" together by Yan Xishan using the "soldier-farmer integration" policy. National Soldier Corps soldier Wang Bingguang said: "Since I was incorporated into the National Soldier Corps, I left behind a 64-year-old father, a young daughter-in-law, and young children at home. Yan Xishan deceived us by saying: You won't survive if the Eighth Route Army comes. Today I know that with Yan Xishan around, the common people cannot survive." Just as he was speaking, Wang Jiuzhang, the father of Wang Hongsheng, a 13-year-old soldier in the National Soldier Corps, rushed from faraway Huoxian. As soon as the father and son met, they burst into tears. Before leaving, Wang Jiuzhang pulled his son and repeatedly thanked the Eighth Route Army staff. All the Yan soldiers who were released vowed to the masses who were celebrating their departure that they would never be used by Chiang and Yan to fight a civil war again.

　　Wang Guoxing, the company commander of the Eighth Company, Third Battalion, 220th Regiment, 74th Brigade, 55th Division of the Kuomintang Army, and Zhang Cunkang, the platoon leader of the First Platoon, First Company, First Battalion, along with their families, a total of 33 people, who laid down their arms in the Longhai Campaign, were sent home on the 27th of this month. They were extremely happy when they heard the news of their return home in the morning, and tears welled up in their eyes. Du Zerong, a transport team member of the 55th Division, who did not believe he would be sent home, said: "The Communist Party is really sending us home. I never dreamed of it." After the dinner, the car that came to pick them up arrived. In addition to returning all the original amounts of legal tender, silver dollars, and gold that each of them had saved, the Eighth Route Army also gave each person 300 yuan for travel expenses and a pack of cigarettes. Before leaving, the Eighth Route Army shook hands warmly with each of them. Chiang's army company commander Wang Guoxing said: "If I didn't have an old mother on my mind, I would definitely stay here." Before leaving, the whistle blew several times, and the Chiang's army soldiers who were being sent home were still reluctant to leave, thanking the Eighth Route Army for liberating them.

　　前线欢送蒋阎放下武器官兵
    摆脱内战骨肉团圆
    兵士感激落泪誓不再替蒋阎打内战
    【本报邯郸三十日电】综合本社前线记者报导；同蒲、陇海前线我军正举行欢送放下武器蒋阎军回家。
    同蒲前线八路军于廿七日欢送自洪赵自卫战役中放下武器之阎军官兵，首批为二百六十五人，均按里程发给路费、路条，使他们返家团圆，重享骨肉欢聚之乐。其中大部为阎锡山以“兵农合一”政策“编捆”来的。国民兵团士兵王炳光说：“自我被编入国民兵后，家中留下六十四岁的父亲，年青的媳妇，年幼的孩子，阎锡山骗我们说：八路军来了活不成。今天我才知道有阎锡山一天，老百姓才活不成。”正说着，国民兵团十三岁的士兵王洪生的父亲，王久章从很远的霍县赶来，父子刚一见面，就抱头痛哭。临行时王久章拉着他的儿子，向八路军工作人员再三拜谢。被释放的阎军全体官兵，都向欢送他们的群众发誓，决不再被蒋阎利用来打内战。
    陇海战役放下武器的国民党军五十五师七十四旅二百二十团三营八连连长王国兴，一营一连一排排长张存康，及家属等共三十三人，于本月二十七日被欢送回家。早上他们知道回家的消息后，高兴极了，大家的眼睛里激起泪珠。不相信会被送回家的五十五师输送队员杜泽容说：“共产党真的送咱们回家，我作梦也没想到。”聚餐完毕，派来接他们的汽车就到了，八路军除了把他们每个人原来存的法币银元金子等都按原数一一归还，还每人发给路费三百元，一包香烟。临行时，八路军和他们每个弟兄亲热的握了手。蒋军连长王国兴说：“我要不是有一个老母亲牵在心里，一定留在这里。”临行时，汽笛响了几次，被送回家的蒋军士兵，还依依不舍，感谢八路军解放了他们。
