　　Scattered Notes from the Front Lines
    Longhai Frontline Reporter

　　Braving the dog days of summer, I rushed towards the front lines of the self-defense counterattack with a heart even hotter than the sun. The people along the way welcomed us. On August 9th, we arrived from the abundant and well-fed Liberated Area to the occupied area, where the people are exploited and oppressed by Chiang's troops, suffering from poverty and hunger. We rested in a village more than ten li from Kaocheng, and saw that every house in the village was closed, the streets were full of weeds, and there were few pedestrians on the road. I asked an old man who was picking manure, "Why is this place so desolate?" He paused for a long time before answering, "This place is simply not a world to live in. During the day, Chiang's troops from the city come to requisition grain, demand money, and seize laborers. At night, bandits rob cattle and demand ransoms everywhere. The rich have fled to the city, and the poor have fled to Hebei (referring to the Liberated Area north of the old Yellow River) to escape the disaster." This haggard old man sighed deeply, and tears could not help but flow from his sunken eyes. I asked again, "How has the harvest been in the last two years?" The old man said, "Speaking of this, Chiang Kai-shek deserves to die ten thousand times. When the Japanese traitors were in the city, farmers had to give him more than eighty jin of grain every year. Since Chiang's troops came to the city, we have already given more than seventy jin in the last six months for military uniforms and bullets. Based on this year's harvest, one mu of land yields no more than four dou of grain, which is not enough for them to take." The old man sighed: "The Japanese surrendered, and which farmer wasn't happy? After suffering for seven or eight years, they thought they would live in peace from now on; who knew that Chiang Kai-shek would start a civil war again? This has made life even harder than when the Japanese were here." I asked him again, "Do you know what it's like in Hebei?" The old man was very excited when he heard this, and he talked endlessly: "Hebei has implemented a reasonable burden system, and one mu of land yields at most twenty jin of grain a year. Nothing happens anymore. We are waiting for the Eighth Route Army to come quickly and drive away the bad guys in the city, and the farmers will be at peace!"

　　On the 12th, I entered Lanfeng City and found many houses demolished on the streets. The bricks and stones from the houses were piled up on the streets. It turned out that Chiang's troops were preparing to use them to build碉堡 fortifications. A碉堡 fortification on North Street had already been built, and they were about to build a three-丈 high watchtower in the center of the city. This watchtower had only been built two chi high, and the facades of six shops around the watchtower were demolished. A shop owner said with tears in his eyes, "If your Eighth Route Army had come a day earlier, our houses would have been saved." The south gate of Lanfeng City, along the long Longhai Railway, had a two-丈 wide and deep blockade ditch on both sides of the road. This ditch was used by the enemy when they were here to blockade the Liberated Area. After the Japanese surrendered, Chiang's troops continued to use this blockade ditch to cut off the connection between our Ji-Lu-Yu area and the eastern Henan Liberated Area. In May of this year, while sending troops to build fortifications to guard the blockade ditch, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale "encirclement and suppression" of our eastern Henan Liberated Area, repeatedly ordering to "wipe out" the local soldiers of eastern Henan. However, under the heroic anti-"encirclement and suppression" of the millions of soldiers and civilians in eastern Henan for three months, Chiang's "encirclement and suppression" plan was shattered. On the evening of the 21st, I and more than twenty fellow villagers pulling ox carts passed through the blockade ditch from the east of Lanfeng City. The fellow villagers' ox carts were blocked by the deep ditch, and they cursed Chiang Kai-shek: "You won't let us live in peace, and you won't even let us walk on a good road." Everyone was covered in sweat and spent two hours before the carts could pass.

　　In the prison in Qixian County, more than one hundred soldiers and civilians from our eastern Henan Liberated Area were detained. When Qixian County was liberated, they happily jumped out of the prison and shook hands with the People's Liberation Army. They angrily said to me, "We have suffered all kinds of crimes here, chili water, pressing benches, burning incense… They forced us to say bad things about the Communist Party. Many of us are Communist Party members. Those traitors didn't get a single good word from us." In the Chiang army county government驻地, I found a document written on the evening of the 15th from the county government to the special commissioner's office, which read: "The situation has been tense recently. We should be quickly informed whether to execute or imprison the traitors (referring to our arrested comrades) detained here." However, this official document had not been sent out, and our army had already entered the city. On the day Qixian County was liberated, many villagers came to the city to find the democratic government, requesting to go to the Chiang army prisoner group to identify the executioners who killed their relatives to take revenge. The democratic government persuaded them, "The government will definitely avenge you and publicly try those heinous traitors."

　　When Chiang's troops attacked our soldiers and civilians, airplanes assisted in the battle every day. On the Longhai front, airplanes could be heard bombing and strafing every day from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Many civilians' cattle and horses were bombed to death. On the morning of the 12th, in Cungao Village west of Lanfeng City, when the plane came, I hid in the house with the landlord's family of five. The landlord was a landlord, and his six tiled houses were riddled with holes by the American-made machine gun bullets fired by the plane, which made the landlord cry and curse.

　　Chiang's troops' inhumane bombing of peaceful residents can only plant deeper hatred in the hearts of the people.

　　At 12:00 on the 24th, an American-made plane with a red head, red neck, and the Kuomintang emblem made a low-altitude reconnaissance of the Chiang army駐地 advancing on Guaying, more than twenty li northeast of Lanfeng City. A few minutes later, it began strafing. Although the advancing army quickly raised contact signs, the Chiang's plane did not care whether they were in contact or not and continued to strafe the advancing army as many as seven times. The advancing army was frightened, and the soldiers suspected, "The air force and the army are fighting again."

　　火线散记
    陇海前线记者
    冒着中伏的太阳，我怀着一颗比太阳更热的心奔向自卫反击战的前线。沿途的人民，欢迎着我们。八月九日，我们已从丰衣足食的解放区到了为蒋军敲榨压迫贫困饥饿的被占区，我们在相距考城十余里的村庄休息，看到村里家家封门闭户，满街生草，路上行人稀少，我问一个拾粪的老汉：“这地方为什么这样凄凉？”他停了半天方答：“这里简直不成世道了，白天有城里的蒋军来征粮要款抓差，晚上有土匪到处抢牛架票，有钱的逃到城里去了，穷的都下了河北（指老黄河北解放区）逃难了”。这位面容憔悴的老汉，深深的叹了口气，凹陷的眼眶里，禁不住的流下泪，我又问：“这两年的收成如何？”老汉说：“提起这来，蒋介石该万死，日本汉奸在城里时，庄稼人每年要给他出八十多斤粮食，自从蒋军到城里后，俺这半年已经出了七十多斤了，什么军装费、子弹费，凭今年的年头，一年一亩地不过收四斗，粮还不够他们要的。”老汉叹一口气：“日本投降了，庄稼人那个不高兴，受了七八年的罪，想着往后该过安生日子了；谁知蒋介石又要打内战，这一来，弄得人比日本在时还难过。”我又问他：“你知道河北怎样？”老汉听了这句话，很兴奋，他就滔滔不绝的说：“河北实行了合理负担，一亩地一年顶多出二十斤粮，啥事都没有了，我们天天盼望八路军快来，把城里的坏蛋们打走，庄稼人就心净啦！”
    十二日进入兰封城，发现大街上很多被拆毁了的房屋，房屋的砖石，堆积在大街上，原来蒋军正预备用它构筑碉堡工事，北大街的一座碉堡，已经筑起了，又要在城正中心的十字街上，修三丈高的炮楼，这座炮楼才垒起二尺砖，炮楼周围六家商号的门面，被拆毁了，一个商号老板含泪说：“你们八路军要早来一天，我们房子就保住了。”兰封城的南关、沿着漫长的陇海铁路望去，路两旁，一边一条两丈多宽深的封锁沟，这沟是敌人在这里时，用来封锁解放区的，日本投降后，蒋军继续用这封锁沟，切断了我冀鲁豫区与豫东解放区的联络。今年五月，蒋介石一面派兵筑堡看守封锁沟，一面大举“围剿”我豫东解放区，一再下令“一网打尽”豫东的地方子弟兵，但是在我豫东百万军民，三个月的英勇反“围剿”下，蒋军的“围剿”计划，被粉碎了。二十一日晚，我和二十多个拉着牛车的老乡们，从兰封城东，通过封锁沟，老乡们的牛车，被深沟阻碍住了，他们破口大骂蒋介石说：“不叫俺过安生日子，连条好路也不叫俺走”。大家急了一身汗，费了两小时的时间，车子才得通过。
    杞县城内的监狱里，扣押着一百多我豫东解放区的军民，杞县城解放时，他们欢欢喜喜的跳出了监狱，和解放军握手，他们气愤的对我说：“在这里我们什么罪都受过了，辣椒水、压板凳，香火烧…………他们强迫叫说共产党不好，我们中间很多都是共产党员，他们那些卖国贼，没一个人从我们口里掏出一句好听的话”。我在蒋军县政府驻地，发现十五日晚写好的一件县府给专署的呈文，上面写着：“近日情况紧张，我处扣留之奸匪（指我被捕同志），或枪毙、或徒刑应速示知”。但是这份公文，尚未寄出，我军已进城了。杞县解放的当天，就有不少的乡下人，进城来找民主政府，要求到蒋军俘虏群里，去认出杀他亲人的刽子手来报仇，民主政府劝他们说：“政府一定要给你们报仇，把那些罪大恶极的汉奸公审”。
    蒋军向我军民进攻时，天天有飞机助战，在陇海前线上，每天早上八点至午后六点，都可听见飞机的轰炸与扫射，有很多老百姓的牛马被炸死了。十二日的上午，在兰封城西寸高村，当飞机来时我就和房东五口，隐蔽在房里，房东是地主，他的六座瓦房，被飞机用美造机枪弹，穿的满房顶都是窟窿，气的房东大哭大骂。
    蒋军如此惨无人道的来轰炸和平居民，只能在人民心里种下了更深的仇恨。
    二十四日十二时一架红头，红颈带国民党徽之美式飞机在兰封城东北二十余里之瓜营，向进犯蒋军驻地低空侦察，数分钟后，开始扫射，虽然进犯军迅速举上联络记号，但蒋记飞机，并不管他们联络不联络，一直向进犯军扫射七次之多。可把进犯军吓坏了，士兵们怀疑说：“空军与陆军又闹磨擦了”。
