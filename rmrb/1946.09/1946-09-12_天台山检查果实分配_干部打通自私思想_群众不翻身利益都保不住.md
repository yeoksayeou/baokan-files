　　Fruit Distribution Inspection in Tiantaishan
    Cadres Overcome Selfish Thoughts
    “If the Masses Don't Overturn Their Situation, Their Interests Can't Be Protected!”
    [This newspaper's Weixian News] In Tiantaishan, cadres, through introspection during the distribution of the fruits of struggle, overcame their thinking and gained the support of the masses. Recently, when the village distributed the fruits of struggle, cadres proposed taking 20% (approximately 600,000 yuan) to reward activists, and another 400,000 yuan to buy short guns for distribution to village cadres and activists. According to this plan, the cadres would consume one-third of all the fruits of struggle, while the more than 300 households of the masses would only receive two-thirds. When the masses heard about this, they were quite dissatisfied, but out of consideration for the cadres' feelings, they were unwilling to raise correct opinions. The village cadres then used the excuse that "the masses have no opinions" and wanted to implement the plan. After consideration, the leadership believed it was inappropriate. In addition to not approving it, they immediately conducted ideological education for the village cadres, raising the following three questions for them to discuss and reflect on: (1) Did the village cadres or the masses obtain the fruits of struggle? (2) How can we gain the support of the masses and do a good job? Is it safer to have the support of the broad masses or to rely on guns as a lone individual? (3) If there are not enough guns to distribute, will there be disputes among the cadres? What impact will this have on the work? After ten days of discussion and reflection, activist Yu Shengjin was the first to overcome his thinking, and he persuaded village chief Wang Mengzhou and Farmers' Association Deputy Director Si Mingtang, saying, "Our thinking is too wrong. We only care about ourselves and not the masses. Now I understand that if the masses can't overturn their situation, even if we get more benefits, we won't be able to protect them!" Within three days, the village cadres' thinking was overcome. They all realized that it was a selfish and self-serving idea. If they did that, they would become divorced from the masses, and the work would not be done well. They unanimously proposed canceling the original plan and excitedly said, "In the future, we will work even more actively!" The village has now smoothly begun distributing the fruits of struggle.

　　天台山检查果实分配
    干部打通自私思想
    “群众不翻身利益都保不住”
    【本报威县讯】天台山干部在分配斗争果实中，经过反省，打通思想，取得了群众拥护。日前该村分配斗争果实时，干部主张提百分之二十（约六十万元）奖励积极分子，并另提四十万元买短枪分发村干积极分子使用。按此计划，干部即将耗去全部斗争果实的三分之一，而三百多户群众却只能获得三分之二。群众闻悉此事，内心颇为不满，但又碍于情面，不愿提出正确意见，村干部遂借口“群众没啥意见”，要按计划执行。领导上考虑后，认为不妥当，除不予批准外并立即对村干部进行思想教育，提出以下三个问题让他们讨论反省。（一）果实是村干部还是群众斗争得来的？（二）如何才能取得群众拥护，把工作搞好？是广大群众拥护自己保险？还是光杆一个靠枪支能给保险？（三）如枪支不敷分配，是否干部之间要起纠纷？工作将会受啥影响？经过十天讨论反省后，积极分子于生金首先打通了思想，并劝说村长王梦周和农会副主任司明堂说：“俺们的想法太不对了，光顾自己不顾群众，现在我醒开这个窍了，群众翻不了身就是自己多得点利益，也会保不住的！”三天内村干部的思想都打通了，都认识了那是自私自利的想法，如果那样作就会脱离群众，工作就会作不好，一致提出取消原来计划，并兴奋地说：“以后我们要更积极的作工作！”现该村已顺利的开始分配果实了。（士魁、剑锋）
