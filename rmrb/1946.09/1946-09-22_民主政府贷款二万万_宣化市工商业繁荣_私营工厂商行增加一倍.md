Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 15th. Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, has now become the leading industrial and commercial center in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway. The city has convenient transportation. In addition to the five stations of Xiayuan, Xinzhuang, Xuanhua City, Shalingzi, and Ningyuan along the Ping-Sui Railway that diagonally cross the county, there are also highways leading to Zhangyuan, Chaigoubao, Longguan, and Suyuan. Products from northern Chahar, southern Chahar, and western Hebei are all distributed from here. In recent years, with the direct support of the democratic government's industrial and commercial loans of 200.2 million yuan in border currency (equivalent to more than 400 million yuan in legal currency), industry and commerce have become increasingly prosperous. The number of private factories and businesses has surged from 342 during the period of enemy and puppet rule to 834, and the number of vendors has increased from 356 to 1,813. Various types of cooperatives composed of workers and citizens have reached more than 100. Before the July 7th Incident, Xuanhua exported a large number of felt hats and furs every year, which were sold to Europe and the United States. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, these raw materials were listed as prohibited military supplies, resulting in the complete closure of these businesses. Now they have resumed operations one after another. The felt hat manufacturing industry has reached 45 households, and the finished sheepskin industry has reached 22 households. Li Yaozong, manager of Zhong Yuan Yu Leather Products, once lived as a vendor due to bankruptcy before liberation. Now he has raised 130,000 yuan in border currency, and the democratic government has loaned him 4.7 million yuan. He has now restored leather production and exceeded the pre-war scale. Xuanhua's special product, the grape industry, is also rapidly recovering. Loans for vine supports and baskets to support the grape planting industry have reached 3.55 million yuan. The city's drainage ditches have been renovated to improve irrigation in the city's paddy field area. The existing and newly planted grapevines number no less than 20,000, and this autumn's harvest is 1 million catties, exceeding the pre-war level of approximately 400,000 catties. In the city's commercial center, the 9,500-meter-long South Street and the 3,000-meter-long Qiaoxi Street have both been widened. Merchants and residents have newly built buildings. Small vendors like Wang Yubin and 80 others have received a total of 110,000 yuan worth of free building materials such as wood and cement from the government, and have built more than 110 new houses, transforming themselves into medium-sized merchants with shops.
