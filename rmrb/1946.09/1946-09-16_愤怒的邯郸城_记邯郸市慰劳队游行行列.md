　　The Angry Handan City
　　——A Record of the Handan City慰劳隊 (Comfort Team) Parade——
　　Gu Jin

　　A patch of dark clouds, about to scatter, pressed down on the southeast, but in the northwest, the sun had long illuminated the earth. At nine o'clock in the morning on the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the roar of "Comfort the People's Soldiers, the Eighth Route Army!" and "Down with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" resounded throughout Handan City. This was the roar of the people, the roar coming from the Handan City慰劳隊 at the public stadium.

　　An irresistible parade, holding high giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, each person holding a small flag, surged towards Peace Avenue with tremendous momentum. The surrounding masses also crowded forward, calling out and cheering. Leading the慰劳隊 (Comfort Team) were the mayor, the chairman of the National Salvation Association... This was the慰劳隊 (Comfort Team) composed of dozens of Yangko teams from the city, representing the people's strength of Handan City, no, representing the people's strength of the entire border region, symbolizing the victory of the patriotic self-defense war!

　　The sound of Yangko drums, wave after wave of slogans like "Support the Patriotic Self-Defense War," "Mobilize all the people in the border region to crush the attacks of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" resounded like thunder. The crowds thronging the streets merged with the parade...

　　Banners from one district and one street passed by, followed by慰劳品 (comfort goods) from one district and one street: two people carried tables piled high with慰劳金 (comfort money); square tables and long tables filled with pork, flour, mooncakes, wine bottles, towels... were carried in rows; cattle, pigs, and sheep were also led in groups; large and small carts loaded with meat and vegetables were transported; countless bags of flour were carried on backs... District after district, street after street, the慰劳 (comfort) delegation of fifteen to sixteen thousand people stretched for two li. The masses were moved to tears with激愤 (indignation) and emotion!

　　Meng Xianhe and Li Zongtang from Beiguan, who volunteered to join the army, were wrapped in red rope and wore large red flowers, sitting in bridal sedans. Women rushed to surround them, to see them, to comfort them, and to urge them to quickly defeat Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army.

　　Yang Xiuyun, a sixty-two-year-old man, angrily led the慰劳隊 (Comfort Team) of Nandalu, shouting slogans while waving a small flag that read "Oppose the Traitorous Han Traitors." Following behind was Old Woman Wang, fifty years old from the south corner of the city, her face flushed red, directing the sisters' Yangko team to sing loudly "Support the Eighth Route Army."

　　Suddenly, those standing on the outer layers of the crowd could only see the flags and not the people in the parade. This was the elementary school students' contingent. Numerous flags fluttered from No. 1 Elementary School, one of which read: "Please send the hearts of us elementary school students to the front lines!"

　　At two o'clock in the afternoon, at the military region's station, the parade队伍 (team) arrived. Minister Ren of the military region, on behalf of the military region, thanked the elders, brothers, and sisters for their consolation to the people's army. At the same time, he reported to everyone the victory report from the Dingtao front, where two divisions of the Kuomintang were annihilated and a military commander was captured alive. Thunderous applause and indignant slogans nearly deafened the ears.

　　Today's parade is so magnificent and moving! Handan has become angry, the entire liberated area has become angry, and the entire Chinese people have become angry. If Chiang Kai-shek does not pull back from the brink, he will suffer a crushing blow from millions upon millions of people!

　　愤怒的邯郸城
    ——记邯郸市慰劳队游行行列——
    古津
    东南面压着一片快要流散的黑云，可是西北高空的太阳，早已照耀大地了。中秋节前一日的上午九时，“慰劳人民的子弟兵八路军！”“打倒卖国贼蒋介石”的怒吼声，响彻了邯郸城。这是人民的吼声，从公共体育场邯郸市慰劳队传出的吼声。
    一支不可抗拒的游行行列，高举着毛主席、朱总司令的巨像，个个手执小旗，奔腾澎湃的向和平大街涌来了；四处的群众，也前呼后唤的拥上去。走在慰劳队前面的，是市长、救国会主任……这是全市几十个秧歌队组成的慰劳队，他代表着邯郸市的人民力量，不，是代表全边区的人民力量，象征着爱国自卫战争的胜利！
    秧歌的锣鼓声，一阵又一阵“支援爱国自卫战争”、“全边区人民动员起来，粉碎卖国贼蒋介石的进攻！”等口号，轰雷般的在响。街上拥挤着的人群，和游行队伍融和在一起了……
    一个区一个街的标语牌过去了，接着，又是一个区一个街的慰劳品过来了：两人抬着堆满慰劳金的桌子来了；摆满猪肉、面粉、月饼、酒瓶、手巾……的方桌，条桌，一列一行的抬来了，牛和猪、羊，也一个一群的牵来了；载满肉类蔬菜的大小车运来了；无数袋的面粉背来了……就这样过了一区又是一区，一街又是一街，一万五、六千人的慰劳大队，一直摆了二里地。群众都带着激愤的情感感动得要流了泪！
    北关自动参军的孟宪和、李宗堂，身上缠着红绳，戴着大红花，坐在花轿里，妇女们争先恐后的围拢去，看他，慰问他，并嘱咐他们赶快把蒋介石的反动军队打垮。
    六十二岁的老人杨秀云，手里摇着“反对卖国汉奸”的小旗，愤怒地领着南大路的慰劳队喊口号。接在后面的，是城南角五十岁的王老婆，胀红了脸，指挥姐妹团的秧歌队高唱“拥护八路军”。
    突然，站在人群外层的，只见旗帜而不见游行的人了。这是小学生的队伍。第一完小飘扬着的无数旗帜，其中一张写着：“请政府把我们小学生的心送到前线去！”
    午后两点钟，在军区驻地，游行队伍到齐了，军区的任部长代表军区谢谢父老兄弟姊妹对人民军队的慰劳，同时对大家报告定陶前线消灭国民党两个师，活捉军长的捷报。雷动的掌声和愤激的口号声，震的耳朵都快聋了。
    今天的行列，是多么壮烈的动人啊！邯郸是愤怒起来了，全解放区都愤怒起来了，全中国人民也愤怒起来了。蒋介石若不悬崖勒马，将遭到千百万人民粉碎的打击！
