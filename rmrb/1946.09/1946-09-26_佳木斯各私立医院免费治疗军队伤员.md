　　Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 22nd—Twenty-one private hospitals in Jiamusi are enthusiastically treating wounded and sick soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army. After a resolution by all physicians of the Physicians' Association, they will donate the entire 500,000 yuan in medical expenses allocated by the government to support the army. President Gao of Datong Hospital slept only three hours for four nights to perform surgery on seriously wounded soldiers. He said, "I cannot sleep for five hours. If the surgery is prolonged, it will increase the comrades' suffering, or lead to disability, or even endanger their lives." Du, the 75-year-old president of Qizhe Hospital, said, "I have lived for more than 70 years, and today is the first time I have seen the people's army. They have shed blood for the people, and we doctors must treat them well to be worthy of the people." The Jiamusi Municipal Government recently held a special banquet to entertain the doctors and nurses of various hospitals to express its gratitude.

　　佳木斯各私立医院免费治疗军队伤员
    【新华社佳木斯二十二日电】佳市二十一家私立医院热心医治民主联军伤病员，并经医师公会全体医师公决，将政府拨给五十万元医药费，全部劳军。大东医院高院长为替重伤员施手术，有四夜只睡眠三小时，他说：“我不能睡五小时，动手术如果时间拖长，就会增加同志们的痛苦，或变成残废，甚至有性命危险。”启哲医院七十五岁的杜老院长说：“我活了七十多岁了，今天才看到人民的军队，他们为人民流了血，我们医师要好好的医治才对得起人民。”佳市政府于日前特设宴招待各院医师护士，以示谢意。
