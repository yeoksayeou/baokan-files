            She will produce 100,000 yuan this year
    Stepping into the west courtyard of Fuyang Middle School, under the deep green cypress trees, along the brick-paved path, rows of vegetable plots of different shapes were growing various vegetables: purple hyacinth beans, red tomatoes, green peppers, white pumpkins, all hiding among the tangled green vegetable bushes, peeking at people. Behind the auditorium, the buildings destroyed by Japanese fascists were littered with bricks and tiles, but in the gaps between the broken bricks and rubble, thanks to the efforts of teachers and students, they had cultivated fertile fields. Vice-Principal Wang said, "This historically barren land has been reclaimed by teachers and students into 271 fertile plots. She will produce 100,000 yuan this year. This can be considered a physical exhibition."
            Cucumbers from four-cent barren land
    Entering the exhibition room, the first thing that stimulated my optic nerve was the two large, fresh, and tender cucumbers hanging on the east wall. I hurried past many hanging charts and went over to take a look. It turned out to be a painting. In the crescent-shaped arc of the cucumber, it was written: After reclaiming four cents of wasteland growing cogongrass, 395 cucumbers were produced, the largest being one chi and seven cun long; six cun and three fen thick, earning a total profit of 1935 yuan.
            A picture of amateur production
    The students' manual labor is not like that of schools in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where embroidery, knotting, and paper folding are all pastimes and decorations for young masters and misses. Their embroidery is to make seven sets of plain clothes; earning 700 yuan to order 80 buttons from the garment bureau, earning 800 yuan. Their paper folding is to fold 39,501 pages of unsown pockets and bind them into books for the factory, and paste 1,090 paper cigarette boxes. Their mud work is to make 4,565 mud bricks and 30 mud roofs. According to a three-month statistic, it exceeded the production task submitted to the public in the first half of the year by 21,258 yuan.
            Girls labor as much as boys
    In terms of labor, I thought girls must be worse than boys, but they cleared wasteland and irrigated fields the same way as boys, and carried 1,626 bricks to the martyrs' cemetery in the same way. Walking the streets and alleys, carrying or lifting bricks with wet soil, they felt the glory of women's labor. There was not the slightest bit of affected airs of young ladies.
    Just as I was looking at this production labor map in a daze, a girl held a signature book and asked me to sign. She was wearing a snow-white homespun jacket and purple-flowered homespun trousers. At first glance, she was a generous, lively, simple, and healthy young person. I recalled the fashionable ladies in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, with their high heels, long cheongsams, powdered faces, and rouged lips, deliberately showing off their so-called curves, their weak and frail bodies, and their affected manners. They were truly from two different worlds.
            Rich young master becomes a labor expert
    Chen Tan, a first-year student and a rich young master from Nangong City, had never seen working people farming, and he thought that farming and picking up manure was a shameful thing. He was unwilling to listen to the production team leader talk about production issues; when the collective went to produce, he secretly slipped away. When the classmates went to mobilize him, he had to go through with it when he could not slip away. His thought was: students come to school to study, and he had never heard of students going to work in the fields like farmers. Later, the classmates all had production achievements and completed the task of handing over to the public. They also received 20% of the personal bonus and 40% to improve their lives. They had money to spend and their lives were improved. This opened his mind, and he also heard the training director Ma say: "Labor is glorious, and eating without labor is the most shameful." This further inspired his enthusiasm for production. Now his body is healthy, and he can carry seven loads of water in one breath. He is nothing like the "spoiled young master" who had no strength to truss a chicken half a year ago!
            The composition of students
    The composition of students: poor peasants 19.8%, middle peasants 57.1%, rich peasants 13.2%, landlords 7.7%, and others 2.2%. From the student composition statistics table, it can be seen that 76.9% are middle and poor peasants. This class of students cannot be found in middle schools in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Adding the rich peasants, that is 90% are children of peasants. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, 90% are children of landlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and warlords. How can peasant children have the qualifications to enter bureaucratic universities and commercialized middle schools?
    Yesterday, in the home of a relative who was a landlord, I saw the notice sent by the Fourth Cun Middle School in Beiping to the parents of students, which stated: tuition for the senior high school department next semester is 60,000 yuan, the junior high school department is 50,000 yuan, and accommodation fees, lecture fees, recreation fees, savings fees... are 240,000 yuan. Ah! Ninety percent or more of the students at Fuyang Middle School cannot afford it. The Kuomintang's private middle schools are like this, and it is said that public middle schools are only worse.
            Integration of teaching, learning, and doing
    In terms of management, it is completely the spirit of democratic autonomy. Students manage themselves. In terms of teaching methods, it is not the teacher lecturing and the students listening, but the integration of teaching, learning, and doing.
    They also do a very good job in cleaning and hygiene. When summer comes, they are afraid of epidemics, so they launch campaigns to catch rats, catch flies, and repel mosquitoes. They ensure that the places most prone to attract mosquitoes and flies—the kitchen and the toilet—are free of their traces. Unfortunately, it was already dusk, and the exhibition time was only one day, so I could not see it in detail, which is a real pity!

　　记滏阳中学展览会
　　落月
            她今年要生产十万元
    迈进滏中的西大院，在蔚苍的柏树下，砖砌的通路两边，一列列形状不同的菜畦，长着各种蔬菜：紫的梅豆，红的蕃茄，绿的秦椒，白的南瓜，都躲在交杂的绿菜丛间窥人。大礼堂后面，被日本法西斯破坏的房屋，砖瓦狼籍，但在碎砖乱瓦隙间，也由于师生们的努力，垦成良圃。王副校长说：“这历史上的旷地，竟被师生们辟成良田二百七十一畦，她今年要生产十万元，这算实物展览吧”。
            四厘荒地的黄瓜
    进了展览室，首先刺激到我的眼神经的，便是东墙上挂的两条肥大鲜嫩的黄瓜。我急忙隔过许多挂图，走到面前一看，原来是一幅画图，在一条新月形的黄瓜弧间，写着：四厘长著蒿草的荒地开垦后，生产黄瓜三九五根，最大的长一尺七寸；粗六寸三分，共获利一九三五元。
            一幅业余生产图
    学生们的手工劳作，不像国民党统治区的学校，刺绣工啦，结扭工啦，叠纸工啦，全是些公子小姐们的消遣玩意儿和欣赏品。她们的刺绣是做便衣七件；得工资七百元给成衣局订钮扣八十件得工资八百元。他们的叠纸工是给工厂叠未袋订成册的书页三九五○一页，糊纸烟盒一○九○个，他们的泥工是托坯四五六五个泥房顶三○间，据三个月的统计，便超过了上半年生产交公任务二一二五八元的记录。
            女生和男生一样劳动
    在劳动上，我以为女生一定比男生差，但是她们和男生同样的开荒，灌畦，同样的给烈士陵园运砖一六二六一个。走大街，过小巷背着或抬着带湿土的砖，她们觉得妇女劳动的光荣。没有丝毫扭扭捏捏的小姐气味。
    我正看着这生产劳动图出神的时候，一位女生持签名簿叫我签名。她穿着雪白的土布褂，紫花色的土布裤，一看便是个大方，活泼，朴素，健康的青年，我回味国民党统治区的摩登小姐们，高跟鞋，长祺袍，粉面，朱唇，走起道来，故意的表现出所谓曲线美，弱不禁风的体格，扭扭捏捏的作风，真是两个世界。
            富家公子变成劳动能手
    一年级的学生陈坛，南宫城内的富家公子，他没有见过劳动人民种庄稼，他觉得种地拾粪是丢人的事。生产小组长谈生产问题，他不愿意听；集体去生产，他偷偷地遛了。同学们去动员他，遛不脱的时候不得不去敷衍一回，他的想思是：学生们到学校来读书，从来也没有听到学生们也像庄稼人一样去干地里活。后来同学们都有了生产成绩，并且完成了交公任务还得到百分之二十的个人分红，百分之四十的改善生活，自己有了钱花，生活得到了改善，这才打通了他的思想，又听到马训导主任说：“劳动是光荣的，不劳而食是最耻辱的”更启发了他的生产积极性，现在他的身体健康了，一连气能挑七担水，那里还像半年前手无缚鸡之力的“阔少”呢！
            学生的成分
    学生的成分：贫农百分之一九·八，中农百分之五七·一，富农百分之一三·二，地主百分之七·七，其他百分之二·二，从学生成分统计表内可以看出百分之七六·九是中贫农，这个阶层的学生，在国民党统治区的中学里是找不到的。再加上富农即百分之九○是农民子弟。国民党统治区内则百分之九十是地主、官僚、买办、军阀的子弟、官厅化的大学，商品化的中学，那有农民子弟入学的资格呢？
    昨天我在一家地主成分的亲戚家中，见到北平四存中学寄给学生家长的通知书内载：下学期高中部学费六万元，初中部五万元，宿费，讲义费，游艺费，储蓄费……二十四万元。呀！滏中的学生，是百分之九十以上的人上不起。国民党的私立中学如此，据说公立中学只有过之而无不及。
            教学做合一
    在管理方面，完全是民主自治的精神，学生自己管理自己，在教学方法上不是先生讲，学生听，而是教、学、做合一。
    在清洁卫生方面也作得非常好，夏天到了，他们怕瘟疫流行，发动捕鼠，捕蝇，驱蚊运动，他们做到最易招惹蚊蝇的处所——厨房和厕所内，没有它们的踪影，可惜天已黄昏了，而展览的时间，又只此一天，未能详细看完，真是一件憾事！
