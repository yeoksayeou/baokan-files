Xinhua News Agency, Huairen, 8th. Our correspondent Gan Xifen reports: Datong has become a dark city. At night, residents tightly close their doors and hide in cellars. Puppet Yan troops take the opportunity to rob, and daytime robbery is widespread in the city. Every soldier returning to camp always gets a bag of grain or a few watches and gold rings. The Puppet Yan troops forcibly conscript young men into the army, three from each neighborhood in the first batch, totaling 1,800 soldiers from the 600 neighborhoods in the city; a large number of prisoners are also taken from the prisons and forced to become soldiers. Since last year, masses in the liberated areas and local workers arrested by the puppet Yan troops in various parts of Yanmen have also been forced to become soldiers, but are not issued weapons. In order to strengthen the bunkers and trenches in the streets of Datong, each household must send one person to serve every day, many of whom are forced to become soldiers. Kuomintang planes reinforce the puppet Yan troops in Datong, and drop ammunition and supplies over Datong, often collapsing houses and crushing residents to death. Zhang Junde, a captured communications soldier of the 2nd Regiment of the 38th Brigade of the Yan army, said that he personally saw a child on the streets of Datong have his brains splattered out by a falling object. Prices in Datong are extremely alarming, with wheat flour rising to more than 3,000 yuan per catty, and even coarse sorghum flour is nearly 2,000 yuan, and it is not available without prior arrangement. After more than 300 puppet Yan troops in Shaling Village, five miles east of Datong, were wiped out, our army found that each person carried a bag of boiled black beans as dry food; which shows the dire situation of their food supply.

　　大同已成黑暗城市
    阎伪军白昼行劫大批抓兵蒋机投掷弹药常砸死居民
    【新华社怀仁八日电】本社记者甘惜芬报导：大同已成一座黑暗城市，入夜居民均紧闭大门，钻进地洞。阎伪军乘机抢劫，市内白昼行劫之风普遍发生。每个士兵回营，总是搞一口袋粮食或弄几个手表金戒指。阎伪军强征壮丁入伍，第一批每闾三人，全城六百闾共征兵一千八百名；并从监狱中抽出大批犯人，强迫当兵。去年以来在雁门各地被阎伪军逮捕之解放区群众及地方工作人员，也强迫当兵，但不发给武器。阎锡山为加强大同各街道的碉堡和壕沟，居民每户每天得派出一人服役，其中许多被迫当兵。国民党飞机增援大同阎伪军，在大同上空投掷弹药物资，时时常打塌民房，压死居民。被俘之阎军三十八旅二团通讯兵张俊德说，他亲眼看见大同街上一个孩子被降落下来的大东西打的脑浆迸出。大同物价极为惊人，白面每斤涨到三千余元，粗劣的高粱面亦将近二千元，而且非预先说好买不到手。大同东五里沙岭村之阎伪军三百余人被歼后，我军发现每人所带之干粮为一口袋煮熟的黑豆；可见其食粮情况之恶劣。
