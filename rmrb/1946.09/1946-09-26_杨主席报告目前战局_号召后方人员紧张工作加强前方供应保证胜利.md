　　Chairman Yang Reports on the Current War Situation
　　Urges Rear Personnel to Work Intensively to Strengthen Frontline Supplies and Guarantee Victory

　　[Our Newspaper News] On the 20th, over four hundred cadres from directly subordinate agencies and schools of the Border Government gathered to listen to Chairman Yang's report. The report first introduced the great victories of self-defense in various liberated areas, especially the great victories on the Jilu Yu and Tongpu frontlines in our region. He then earnestly pointed out: The Jilu Yu battlefield has become one of the main battlefields in the country. Although the first stage of the battle has achieved great victory, Chiang Kai-shek is not reconciled. Now Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng are personally deploying and commanding fifty divisions of troops, launching a massive invasion. A great battle is about to break out, and the situation is extremely tense. We must not be paralyzed, thinking that everything is fine after winning a battle. The soldiers on the front lines are shedding blood and sacrificing their lives. The "Sun Lake Annihilation Battle" is a real depiction of this. We in the rear must work diligently, economize on food and clothing, and fully support the front lines.

　　Although we have already done some fundraising work, we must continue to do so in the future. Chairman Yang emphasized: Everyone must attach great importance to the transportation and supply work for the front lines. Our brilliant commanders can lead us to win battles, but if the ammunition supply cannot keep up, the victory will be affected. Finally, Chairman Yang called on everyone to study carefully the Liberation Daily editorial "Chiang's Army is Bound to Fail," to clear their minds, and to do a good job in anti-espionage work. We must continue to mobilize the masses to turn themselves around. Everyone must work together and be ready to meet the battle at any time.

　　杨主席报告目前战局
　　号召后方人员紧张工作加强前方供应保证胜利
    【本报消息】二十日下午，边府各直属机关学校干部四百余人集会，听取杨主席报告，报告中首先介绍各解放区自卫大捷，特别是我区冀鲁豫及同蒲前线大捷情况后，恳切指出：冀鲁豫战场已经成为全国主要战场之一，第一段战斗虽然已取得了伟大胜利，但蒋介石并不甘心，现在蒋介石、陈诚亲自布置指挥五十师兵力，大举进犯，大战即将爆发，时局万分紧张，我们千万不能麻痹，认为打了胜仗就万事大吉。前线将士流血牺牲，“太阳湖歼灭战”就是实际的写照，我们在后方一定要踏踏实实工作，节衣缩食，全力支援前线。
    虽然我们已经做了些募捐工作，今后还要继续做。杨主席着重指出：大家要十分重视对前方运输供应工作。我们英明的指挥员能领导打胜仗，但弹药供应不上，胜利就会受到影响。最后，杨主席号召大家好好学习解放日报“蒋军必败”社论，把头脑清醒起来，全力做好防奸工作，继续发动群众翻身，大家要一齐努力，随时准备迎接战斗。
