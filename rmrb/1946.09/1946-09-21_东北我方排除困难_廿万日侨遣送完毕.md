　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 18th. The repatriation of Japanese nationals from the Northeast Liberated Areas, with the exception of Andong, was completed ahead of schedule on the 14th. More than 200,000 people were repatriated. According to the person in charge of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's Repatriation Office for Japanese Nationals, "The repatriation of Japanese nationals from the Northeast Liberated Areas began on August 19th and was originally scheduled to be completed on September 20th. During the repatriation period, although the Chiang side repeatedly violated the agreement, initially refusing to accept them at the Songhua River, and later refusing to accept the sick, the process was delayed. However, with the concerted efforts of all personnel in our office, the repatriation was finally completed ahead of schedule on the 14th. A total of 95,063 people were repatriated from the Songhua and Harbin districts, 70,456 from Qiqihar, 1,463 from Bei'an, 4,805 from Mudanjiang, over 40,000 from Yanji, and over 17,000 from Tonghua. Currently, there are only about 2,000 people remaining in Harbin, including the staff of the Japanese Association (an organization for Japanese people to manage their own affairs) and their families, who are scheduled to be repatriated on the 19th." Regarding the repatriation of Japanese nationals from the South Manchuria area, the person in charge refuted the Central News Agency's rumors, saying: "Our side, through the U.S. side, informed the Chiang side to arrange a time and place with our side through the 30th Executive Group to repatriate Japanese nationals from Andong. However, the Chiang side delayed until the afternoon of September 5th when the U.S. side suddenly notified our side that it would begin receiving them at the bridgehead on the 17th. Because the time was too short for our side, we agreed with the 30th Executive Group to start on the 12th. However, when our side sent the Japanese nationals to the bridgehead on the 16th, the Chiang side refused to receive them again, and their intention to obstruct is already obvious. As for the Central News Agency's claim that "out of 55,000 Japanese people in Tonghua, only more than 17,000 have been sent away," it is completely fabricated and not worth refuting."

　　东北我方排除困难
    廿万日侨遣送完毕
    【新华社哈尔滨十八日电】东北解放区遣送日侨工作除安东外，已于十四日提前完成。共遣送二十余万人。据东北民主联军总部遣送日侨办事处负责人告记者称：“东北解放区遣送日侨工作自八月十九日开始，原定九月二十日完成。在遣送期间，虽由于蒋方屡次破坏协定，最初在松花江边拒不接收，后又不收病人，致稽延时日。但在本处全体人员一致努力下，终于在十四日提前遣毕。计松哈区九五、○六三人，齐齐哈尔七○、四五六人，北安区一、四六三人，牡丹江区四、八○五人，延吉区四万余人，通化一万七千余人。目前尚在哈市者，仅日本人会（日人管理自己事务之组织）的工作人员及其眷属等约二千人，已定于十九日全部遣走”关于南满地区遣送日侨问题，该负责人驳斥中央社之造谣称：“我方曾经美方告蒋方由三十执行小组与我方规定时间地点俾遣送安东之日侨，但蒋方延至九月五日下午始由美方突然通知我方定于十七日在桥头开始接收，我方因时间过于仓促，经与三十执行小组商妥自十二日开始。但十六日我方将日侨送至桥头时，蒋方又拒不接收，其居心阻挠，已昭然若揭。至于中央社所谓“通化有五万五千日人仅送走一万七千余名”云云，则完全凭空捏造，不值一驳。
