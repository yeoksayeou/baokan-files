Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: Washington dispatch: At the beginning of this month, some American public opinion opposed the US authorities' erroneous China policy. The Petersburg *Index-Journal*, commenting on the suggestion of the United States administering the disputed areas between the Chinese Communists and Nationalists, stated: "The world is so big that a more impossible proposal cannot be found. Guardianship is definitely not what we, the American people, need. This matter will require us to station an army in China, and this army will soon be caught in the whirlpool of war. We should not send troops to China to act as wet nurses for the Chinese (actually, the Kuomintang reactionaries), nor should we pull chestnuts out of the fire for Chiang Kai-shek." Democratic Congressman Po Bell stated in a speech in Seattle on the 5th: "The United States should stay out of China. If China intensifies its arms buildup, the United States will encounter another Spanish problem in China." Po forcefully stated: "The methods used by the American representatives to obtain peace are inevitably wrong. They have abandoned Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy and gone beyond their scope of obligations."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th: Washington dispatch: US Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech on the 12th has aroused fierce internal struggle in the United States. According to Reuters, "it has already caused a serious crisis in the Washington government." Wallace criticized the propositions of inciting a US-Soviet war and that the United States should not interfere in China's internal affairs. According to the United Press, it aroused the attention and approval of the American people who care about peace. Mrs. Roosevelt declared on the 17th that although American foreign policy must be decided by the State Department, the people of the whole country have the right to understand the opinions expressed by Wallace. She pointed out that fear of the Soviet Union is currently unrealistic. Wallace himself issued a statement on the 16th, reiterating the beliefs he expressed in his speech on the 12th. He said, "I find that both the left and the right disagree with my views." And said, "I will express my opinion on this issue again in the short term." At the same time, he will go to the White House on the 17th to meet with Truman. In response, Acting US Secretary of State Clayton said on the 17th that any future speeches by Wallace on foreign policy may be reviewed by the Secretary of State before publication. But he also said, "Even if Wallace's speech is inconsistent with US foreign policy, the State Department cannot prevent its publication." The reactionaries in the United States are doing their best to attack Wallace and are exerting public pressure on Truman. Conservative elements within the Democratic Party "expressed indignation" at Wallace, and they reminded Truman that "Wallace was a Republican in the past, and only joined the party during Roosevelt's New Deal, so he should be expelled from the party." The Republican Party strongly demanded that "Wallace must resign voluntarily. If he does not resign voluntarily, Truman should ask him to resign." And criticized Truman's "fallacy." Vandenberg, in Paris, in a phone call with Truman, further warned that "Truman cannot expect continued bipartisan support for his foreign policy," and suggested that "Truman must choose between Wallace and Byrnes as the spokesperson for his foreign policy"? Under these circumstances, Truman immediately appeared flustered. First, he withdrew his "agreement" to Wallace's speech, and then, according to the United Press, "it is expected that Truman will support Byrnes to such an extent that he will ask Wallace to resign, or not touch on foreign policy in future speeches, or send Truman's special plane, the "Sacred Cow," to Paris to bring the American delegation back to Washington."

　　美舆论抨击政府对华错误政策
    美不应为蒋火中取栗           
    华莱士演说引起华府内部激烈斗争
    【新华社延安十九日电】华盛顿航讯：本月初旬，美国若干舆论反对美当局错误的对华政策。彼得斯堡《指数报》评论关于美国代管中国国共争执区之建议一节称：“世界之大，决不能发现较此更属不可能之建议。代管一事，决非我们美国人民所须要，此事将使我们须在中国留驻一支军队，而此项军队不久将卷入战争之漩涡，我们不应派军队前往中国，以充任中国人（按实际上是国民党反动派）之乳母，亦不应为蒋介石火中取栗。”民主党议员泼贝尔五日在西雅图发表演说称：“美国应置身于中国之外，若中国加紧备战，美国将在中国另遇一西班牙问题。”泼氏力称：“美国代表所用以获取和平之方法不免错误，彼等已放弃罗斯福之善邻政策，而越出其义务范围之外。”
    【新华社延安十八日电】华盛顿讯：美商务部长华莱士十二日的演说，已引起美国内部的激烈斗争，据路透社称：“且已招致华盛顿政府的严重危机”。华莱士抨击挑拨美苏战争和美国不应干涉中国内政之主张，据合众社称：引起美国关心和平人民的注意和赞成。罗斯福夫人十七日宣称：美国的外交政策虽必须由国务院决定，但全国人民有权了解华莱士所发表的意见。她指出对苏联的恐惧，目前是不现实的。华莱士本人则于十六日发表声明，重申他十二日演说中所发表之信念，他说：“我发现左右派都不同意我的意见。”并说：“我将在短期内对这一问题再度发表意见”。同时，他将于十七日赴白宫与杜鲁门晤谈。对此，美代理国务卿克莱顿于十七日说：华莱士将来任何关于外交政策的演讲，在发表前可能经国务卿审查。但又说：“如果华莱士的演讲与美外交政策不符合时，国务院也不能阻止其发表”。美国内的反动派则极力攻击华莱士，并对杜鲁门施以公开压力，民主党内的保守分子对莱华士“表示气愤”，他们提醒杜鲁门说：“华莱士过去是共和党员，只是在罗斯福新政时才参加党的，因此应予开除党籍。”共和党强烈要求“华莱士必须自动辞职，如果不自动辞职，杜鲁门应要求他辞职”。并抨击杜鲁门的“谬误”。在巴黎的范登堡，在与杜鲁门通话中，更警告“杜氏不能期待两党对其外交政策的继续支持”，并示意“杜氏要在华莱士与贝纳斯之间抉择谁为其外交政策发言人”？在此情况下，杜鲁门即表示手忙脚乱，初则撤回其对华莱士演说的“同意”，接着，据合众社称：“预料杜鲁门将支持贝纳斯到这样的程度，要求华莱士辞职，或在以后的演说中勿触及外交政策，或派遣杜鲁门“圣牛”号专机赴巴黎接美国代表团归返华府。
