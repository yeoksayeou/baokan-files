　　Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 29th: Comrade Li Yu, Chairman of the Shandong Democratic Provincial Government, wrote an article for the "September 1st" festival to present to Shandong journalists. The article called on all journalists to (1) strive to learn from reality and integrate with the people. Some comrades believe that "journalism is not practical work," which is inconsistent with the facts. The best journalists must be the best practical workers; otherwise, it is impossible to explain how our newspapers have combined with reality in the past and how they will further integrate with reality in the future. The only question is how journalists themselves can care about reality in their current positions and humbly learn from reality. Some comrades believe that "running a newspaper that is not close to workers, peasants, and soldiers is not as good as doing mass work," which is even more unrealistic. As everyone knows, our newspaper is precisely the newspaper of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the newspaper of the people. We ourselves are public servants of the people and faithful spokespersons of the people. Everything in the newspaper must be a representative of the people's will and aspirations; otherwise, it is not serving the people or not serving them faithfully enough. The only question is how to overcome certain tendencies of aiming too high and being detached from the masses in the current position, approaching and understanding the masses more, studying the level of the masses and the forms they like to see and hear in order to better serve the people. (2) Dedicate oneself to journalism for life, work hard, and cultivate a large number of journalists proficient in their profession, thoroughly overcoming undesirable tendencies such as status consciousness, eagerness for fame, and lack of long-term planning. (3) Unite the vast number of patriotic and democratic journalists and humbly learn from their experience to improve oneself. Today, when the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique intends to strangle progressive journalism, we must do our best to help them and cooperate better with them.

　　黎玉同志号召新闻工作者
    更进一步与实际结合
    【新华社临沂二十九日电】山东民主省政府黎玉主席为“九一”节撰文赠予山东新闻工作者，文中并号召全体新闻工作者（一）努力向实际学习与人民结合。有些同志认为“新闻工作不是实际工作”，这是不合事实的想法。最优秀的新闻工作者，一定是最优秀的实际工作者，否则就无法说明我们报纸过去是怎样结合了实际和今后将如何更进一步的结合实际。问题只在于新闻工作者本身如何在现在岗位上关心实际并虚心向实际学习。也有些同志认为“办报不接近工农兵，不如作群众工作好”，这更是不实事求是的想法。殊不知我们的报纸正是工农兵的报纸，人民的报纸，我们自己就是人民的公仆与人民忠实的代言人，报纸上每件事物必须是人民意志与愿望的代表，否则就不是为人民服务或服务的不够忠实。问题只在于自己如何克服某些好高骛远脱离群众的作风，在目前的岗位上，多接近与了解群众研究群众的水平及其喜见乐闻的形式以求更好地为人民服务。（二）终生献身新闻事业，埋头苦干，培养大批精通业务的新闻工作者，彻底克服地位观念成名心急不作长期打算等不良偏向。（三）团结广大爱国与民主的新闻同志，虚心学习他的经验以提高自己。在蒋介石反动集团意在绞杀进步新闻事业的今天，我们更要尽量的援助他们并与他们更好地合作。
