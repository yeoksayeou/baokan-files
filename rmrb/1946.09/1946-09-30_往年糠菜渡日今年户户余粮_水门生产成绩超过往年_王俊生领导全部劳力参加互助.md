　　[Report from This Newspaper in Changzhi on the 24th] According to estimates before the autumn harvest, Shuimen, the production model village under the leadership of labor hero Wang Junsheng of Xingtai, can achieve a ratio of three parts cultivated to one part surplus grain for the entire village this year. Production achievements can exceed any previous year. The masses joining the mutual aid and labor exchange organizations in the village have reached 100%. The silkworm breeding industry, which had declined due to the war, has also been restored this year. All the mountain wasteland has been reclaimed, more than 200 mu more than last year. All the land has been fertilized one-third more than last year. Various crops have generally been hoed one more time than in the past. Cotton has received three additional workdays. This year, the entire village raised 180 silkworm rearing sheets, earning 720,000 yuan. The model mutual aid team led by Cheng Yushan raised 59 silkworm rearing sheets this year, earning 200,000 yuan, enough to buy 80 large measures of corn. This alone can solve the team's annual grain consumption with a surplus. It is estimated that the total income from autumn crops and mountain products for the entire team can reach "cultivate one, surplus one." The team currently raises 570 sheep, which can be increased to 1,400-1,500 in five years. Selling old sheep at that time will be enough to solve the team's livelihood. They are now also planning to raise four beehives, which can be increased to 50 in five years, yielding 2,500 jin of honey annually. Encouraged by this bright prospect, they are highly enthusiastic about developing production. In the past, the village was a poor small village in the mountainous area of western Xingtai, with little land and poor soil, and insufficient grain. Villagers used to live on bran and wild herbs. This year, eating bran has become a rare occurrence. According to the personnel in charge of production in the county, the village's ability to achieve a ratio of three parts cultivated to one part surplus grain for the entire village is a step forward based on the success of the production movement in recent years, proving that the direction of developing production in mountainous areas and combining agriculture and sideline occupations is entirely correct. However, this year's production movement in the village still has the following shortcomings: (1) Some teams' production plans are not sound and have not been discussed by the masses. Therefore, the masses are passive, and their enthusiasm for creativity is not high enough. On the contrary, Cheng Yushan's team often has democratic discussions, plans are precise, and the enthusiasm for production is high, so the results are particularly good. (2) The problems in mutual aid leadership have not been summarized in time, the experience of each team cannot be exchanged in a timely manner, and new active members and heroes have not received timely encouragement, hindering them from further improving their enthusiasm. (3) The leadership only pays attention to encouraging semi-able-bodied laborers, often assigning them lighter labor and often increasing their scores, causing the fully able-bodied laborers to be dissatisfied due to being at a disadvantage. Moreover, because the scores of the semi-able-bodied laborers are too high, a new inequality has arisen. (4) The policy of combining agriculture and sideline occupations has not been implemented enough, excessively emphasizing agriculture and restricting surplus labor from going out to do odd jobs or transportation. Agricultural mutual aid wages are low, and households with more land benefit, while households with less land are dissatisfied. (5) The new land problems of the peasants have not been resolved in conjunction with the mass movement. Much of the land of many poor peasants is mountain wasteland opened up or mortgaged land two years ago. Some of the wasteland can no longer be cultivated, and the mortgaged land may be withdrawn. These problems have partially affected the production enthusiasm of the masses and should be resolved quickly.

　　往年糠菜渡日今年户户余粮
　　水门生产成绩超过往年
　　王俊生领导全部劳力参加互助
    【本报长治二十四日电】邢台劳动英雄王俊生领导下的生产模范村水门，据秋收前估计，今年全村均可达到耕三余一。生产成绩可超过以往任何一年。该村涌入变工互助组织的群众，已达百分之百。因抗战而衰落的饲蚕业，今年又告恢复。山荒已被开尽，比去年多种荒地二百余亩。全部土地，均较去年多施肥三分之一。各种庄稼，普遍较过去多锄一次。棉花特别加三工。全村今年养蚕一百八十席，获利七十二万元。模范互助组程玉山组今年养蚕五十九席，获利二十万元，可买玉茭八十大石。只此一宗，即可解决全组全年吃粮而有余。预计秋禾山货全部收入全组可达“耕一余一”。该组现养羊五百七十只，五年后可增到一千四、五百只。彼时光卖老羊亦足解决全组生活。现又计划养蜂四窝，五年后可增到五十窝，年可收蜜二千五百斤，他们为这个光明的远景所鼓舞，对发展生产，热情很高。该村过去为邢台西部山川区之贫苦小村，地少土薄，粮食不足，村民向以糠菜度日；今年吃糠已成罕事。据该县领导生产的人员谈：该村能达到全村耕三余一，是在数年来生产运动的成功基础上提高了一步，证明在山地发展生产，农副业结合方针是完全正确的。但是，今年该村生产运动尚有如下缺点：（一）有些组生产计划不健全，亦未经群众讨论。所以群众表现被动，积极创造性还不够高，相反的，程玉山组经常民主讨论，计划精确，生产劲头就大，成绩也就特别好。（二）互助领导上的问题未能按时总结，各组经验不能及时交流，新生积极分子与英雄没有获得及时鼓励，妨碍他们积极进取热情进一步提高。（三）领导上只注意鼓励半劳力，常分给他们较轻的劳动且常提高其分数，使全劳力因吃亏而不满。且因过于提高了半劳力的分数，产生了新的不等价。（四）农副业结合的方针还贯彻得不够，过分强调农业，限制了剩余劳力出外打短工或运输。农业互助工资低，地多户占便宜，地少户不满。（五）未结合群众运动来解决农民新的土地问题。许多贫农的土地多是两年前开的山荒或典入的土地，荒地有的已不能再种，典地又可能被抽，这些问题在部分的影响了群众生产热情，该迅速求得解决。
