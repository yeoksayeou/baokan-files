　　Gaoyi Wangliu and Other Villages Organize Grievance Teams
    Continuing to Implement Emancipation During the Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 19th] As the autumn harvest and autumn plowing/wheat planting campaign arrives, to ensure that the mass emancipation movement is not interrupted, Wangliu, Qian Zhangliu, Fengliu and other villages in Gaoyi, based on the principle of voluntary association, have formed many autumn harvest grievance teams and autumn harvest grievance groups with all the villagers, closely integrating the autumn harvest with emancipation. They proposed: "Big measures and small measures, implement the autumn harvest; autumn plowing does not stop, wheat planting does not cease, work hard until the end of the year, and never relax until the land deeds are recovered!" Nine male autumn harvest grievance groups and seven women's groups have now been organized. Qian Zhangliu Village has finished cutting the millet, and during daily rest and meals, they brew grievances and discuss emancipation. When calculating work points in the evening, each group reports the materials collected during the grievance sessions. Therefore, in the tense autumn harvest campaign, the grievance movement appears even more enthusiastic. They are preparing to seize the gaps in the work to convene an emancipation conference that has been brewing during the harvest, once the autumn harvest has come to a temporary end.

　　高邑王留等村组织诉苦队
    秋收中继续贯彻翻身
    【本报长治十九日电】秋收秋耕种麦运动已到，为使群众翻身运动不致中断，高邑王留、前张留、冯留等村以自愿结合原则将全村群众组成许多秋收诉苦队和秋收诉苦小组，使秋收与翻身密切结合，他们提出：“大斗小斗，贯彻秋收；秋耕不歇，种麦不停，一鼓劲干到年冬，不收回房地决不松手！”现已组织起九个男秋收诉苦小组，七个妇女组。前张留村已将谷子割完，每天休息与吃饭时即酝酿诉苦讨论翻身，晚上算工账时各组即汇报诉苦时收集的材料，因而在紧张的秋收运动中，诉苦运动更显得热烈。他们准备于秋收暂告一段落时，即抓紧空隙召开在收割中已酝酿成熟的翻身大会。
