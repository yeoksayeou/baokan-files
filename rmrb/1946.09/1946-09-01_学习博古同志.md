　　Learning from Comrade Bogu

    --Comrade Bogu's death is not only a great loss to our Party and the people of the whole country, but also means that the Party's news front has lost a strong, wise, and brilliant commander. On the occasion of "September 1st" Journalist's Day, we publish this article to express our remembrance of the martyrs and to set an example for our successors. Comrade Bogu's dedication, fighting spirit, and creativity in the revolutionary news undertaking are worthy of study and diligent emulation by every comrade engaged in the Party's news work.
    --Editor
    When we mourn Comrade Bogu, we cannot help but think of his many strengths that are worthy of our admiration and learning. He often said to us: "I will devote myself to the revolutionary news undertaking for the rest of my life. Under the leadership of our Party, we have established a very good people's regime and a people's army; we must also have a very good people's news undertaking." For this "lifelong career," he worked all day long and stayed up late at night, stubbornly refusing to rest even when he was ill. He also said: "We make a living from revolutionary news, and that's how it is." Comrade Bogu often carefully studied Chairman Mao's working methods and thinking methods. He would repeatedly discuss with us every instruction from Chairman Mao and every revision of the newspaper's articles, and when he understood something, he would often happily say: "This is Chairman Mao's unique insight, and everyone should grasp it well." Over the years, Comrade Bogu has increasingly skillfully applied Chairman Mao's thought to practical work. For example, the ideas of combining the newspaper with the masses, the whole Party running the newspaper, the masses running the newspaper, and the combination of professional journalists, backbone correspondents, and a wide range of correspondents; the idea that news must be completely true, using facts and reasoning to conduct propaganda, so that our propaganda has "irrefutable" arguments; and the idea of conducting propaganda struggles in a way that is "reasonable, advantageous, and restrained," etc. In particular, in the recent two or three years, after many major events, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the strong and astute direct guidance of Comrade Bogu, we have never lost our direction in propaganda, and we have begun to accumulate some experience. Comrade Bogu was extremely serious and responsible in his work. He could always put forward incisive opinions on every task of the newspaper and the news agency. He often took the initiative to set an example in important work. During the great advance of the liberated areas last year, he personally made cards with the troop numbers and positions clearly marked. He repeatedly said: "With the correct political direction, business is of decisive significance. May I ask, if the business is not good, how can the correct political direction be expressed?" He paid great attention to writing skills. He often instructed reporters: "Report faithfully, report accurately, report vividly, report quickly." He hated stale clichés the most. After reading them, he often sighed and said: "If the words are not surprising, the style will not be refined." Comrade Bogu had a habit of reading widely, so his knowledge was particularly broad. He was especially persistent in translation work. As soon as he had any spare time, he would be at his desk translating. He said: "Dogmatism has been overthrown, and we need to read more books. In the past, the method of reading was not correct, it is not that books are harmful." He often earnestly advised us: "Squeeze out time to read more books, it is beneficial to your work." Comrade Bogu also had a characteristic, that is, he was full of vigor and never satisfied with the status quo. His praise for the achievements and advantages of the work was full of enthusiasm, but his criticism of shortcomings and mistakes was straightforward and sharp, even sarcastic. He was always tirelessly turning his agile mind, studying the situation, direction, and strategies of the propaganda struggle, and planning how to run the people's news undertaking better.
    --Yu Guangsheng, Ai Siqi, Chen Kehan: Mourning our President and Comrade Bogu--
    In order to make the *Liberation Daily* and the *Xinhua News Agency* truly the mouthpiece of the people, and in order to cultivate Party news professionals from work, you have spent a great deal of effort. You never tire of exploring the art of struggle on the propaganda front. You constantly tell others your insights and enthusiastically encourage others to explore with you. I have heard Comrade Chen Kehan say to others: "Comrade Bogu is strong in leading propaganda work." You work tirelessly every day, often getting up at six or seven o'clock and working until twelve o'clock before you can wash your face and have breakfast, and even while washing your face and eating, you are still talking and reading news. If a new political event occurs, it becomes even more tense. You hurriedly ask the responsible comrades of the Central Committee for instructions and suggestions, and then study it together with the comrades of the editorial board to write the various materials into telegrams or papers according to the Party's guidelines and principles. Such work often keeps you up all night, and the next morning's work is still not relaxed. Not only did you do the above work, but you also personally told the relevant agencies about new and important political news over the phone. Your hearing is not very good, so you often use your own hearing as the standard, fearing that others will not be able to hear clearly. As a result, you often make your own loud voice hoarse. From this incident, we can also see your infinite enthusiasm for revolutionary work.
    Speaking from what I hear when I come back every week, you rarely rest in a day. In addition to reading manuscripts, writing articles, attending meetings, and having individual conversations, you also read various Chinese and English newspapers and magazines to study the content and editing techniques. You study everything carefully. If you have more time, you also do translation work. Your translations are all done by squeezing time from work. Except for a few minutes of a nap or a walk after dinner, you rarely rest. What is your entertainment? It is also what you need in your work, such as listening to the radio, not to listen to music, but to listen to domestic and foreign oral broadcast news. Sometimes you hear news faster than the *Xinhua News Agency* receives it. You listen to these broadcasts in order to "know the enemy and know yourself" and fight against the reactionaries, and to absorb experience from all aspects, and check our own work of the *Xinhua News Agency* from the broadcast reflections from the outside, so as to improve this work. When you hear the *Xinhua News Agency* broadcast very clearly, you will immediately laugh and give me the headphones to listen to, and give them to Comrade Yu Sheng and the others. You also use reading novels to rest. You always read novels for an hour before going to bed every day. You often tell me that reading novels can increase social knowledge, broaden your horizons, and help with writing skills. In short, your entertainment and recreation are inseparable from your work. Especially in the past four or five years, you have been a stubborn working ox in the revolutionary ranks, working silently.

　　学习博古同志
    ——博古同志之遇难，不仅是我党与全国人民之重大损失，在党的新闻战线上也失掉了一个坚强英明的天才指挥者。际兹“九一”记者节，摘刊此文，以表缅怀先烈之忱，以留范于我后进者。博古同志对于革命的新闻事业之鞠躬尽瘁、战斗与创造的精神，是值得我们每个从事党的新闻工作的同志学习黾勉的。
    ——编者      
    我们悼念博古同志，不能不想起他的许许多多值得我们景仰和学习的长处。他常对我们说：“我将终身从事于革命的新闻事业。在我们党领导下，已建立了很好的人民政权和人民军队；我们还必须有很好的人民的新闻事业。”为了这“终身事业”，他竟整天劳作，深夜不寐，虽在疾病之时，亦倔强地拒绝休息。他还说：“我们吃革命的新闻饭，就是这样的。”博古同志经常悉心揣摩毛主席的工作方法和思想方法，对毛主席的每一指示和对报社文章的每一修改，他必须反复和我们探讨，有所领会，往往高兴地说：“这是毛主席的独特见解，大家要好好掌握。”几年以来，博古同志日益熟练地把毛主席的思想具体运用在实际工作中，例如报纸与群众结合、全党办报、群众办报的思想，职业记者、基干通讯员和广大通讯员结合的思想，新闻必须完全真实，用事实和说理进行宣传，使我们的宣传有“驳不倒”的论据的思想，进行宣传斗争要“有理、有利、有节”的思想等等。特别是最近两三年以来，我们经过很多的巨大事变，在党中央和毛主席领导之下，在博古同志坚强和机敏的直接指导之下，我们在宣传方针上从来没有迷失过方向，我们并开始积垒一些经验。博古同志对于业务是极其认真和负责的，他对于报社和通讯社的每一项工作，都能不时提出精辟的意见。他对重要工作，常常亲自动手，树立榜样，在去年解放区大进军时，他曾亲制卡片，部队番号位置一目了然。他曾三番四复地说：“有了正确的政治方针，业务就有决定意义。请问业务如果不精，正确的政治方针又何从表现呢？”他很注意写作技巧，他经常地指示记者们：“要忠实的报导，精确的报导，生动的报导，迅速的报导。”他最痛恶陈腐烂调，他看了之后，往往叹口气说：“语不惊人辞不修”。博古同志有博览群书的习惯，所以他的知识特别渊博。他对于翻译工作尤其坚持不懈，他一有余晷，即伏案翻译。他说：“教条主义反掉了，更要多读书。过去读书方法不对头，不是书会害人。”他常恳挚地劝我们：“挤出时间多看书，对你们工作是有好处的。”博古同志还有一个特点，就是朝气蓬勃，永不满足于现状。对于工作的成绩和优点，他的赞扬固然充满着热忱，可是他对缺点和错误的批评是直率和尖锐的，甚至于是挖苦的。他总是永无休止地转运他的灵敏活泼的头脑，研究宣传斗争的形势、方针和策略，筹划把人民的新闻事业办得更好的方案和办法。
    ——余光生、艾思奇、陈克寒：悼念我们的社长和战友博古同志——
    为了使解放日报和新华社成为真正人民的喉舌，为了从工作中培养党的新闻事业干部，你是费了相当大的精力的。你永不疲倦，摸索着宣传战线上斗争艺术。你不断的把心得告诉别人，并热忱的鼓舞别人也和你一样去摸索。我听见过陈克寒同志曾对别人说：“博古同志在宣传工作领导上是坚强的。”你不辞辛劳的每天工作，常常六七点钟起床，忙到十二点钟才能洗脸吃早饭，并在洗脸吃饭的时候，还在谈话和看消息。假如遇到有新的政治事情发生，那就更紧张了，你就匆忙地向中央负责同志请示，和提意见，然后与编委会的同志共同研究，把各种材料根据党的方针、党的主张写成电讯或论文。这样的工作常常使你通宵不睡，而第二天早上的工作，你仍然是不放松的。你不仅做了上述的工作，你还亲口从电话中告诉有关机关以新的重要政治消息，你的耳朵不大好，因此你常用自己的听觉为标准，深怕别人听不清楚，结果呢？常常把你的宏亮的嗓子也讲得嘶哑不成声。就从这件事，也可以看出你对革命工作的无限热忱。
    以我每星期回来听见的情形来说，你一天是很少休息的，除了看稿件，写文章，开会讨论，个别谈话以外，还要看各种中英文的报章杂志，以研究其中的内容到编排技术，你都用心研究。再有时间的话，你还做翻译工作。你的译品，都是从工作中挤时间来做的。除了午睡或晚饭后散步几分钟外，就很少见你休息了。你的娱乐是什么呢？也是你工作中所需要的，如听广播，不是听音乐，而是听国内外的口头广播的消息，有时候你听到的消息比新华社收到的消息还快。你听这些广播，也是为了“知彼知己”和反动派进行斗争，并且摄取各方面的经验，从外面的广播反映中检查我们新华社自己的工作，从而改进这一工作。当着听到新华社广播很清楚的时候，你马上会喜笑起来，拿着耳机给我听，给余生同志他们听。你还以看小说来休息，每天临睡前总要看一小时的小说。你常对我说，看小说可以增加社会知识，放宽眼界，对文字修养也有帮助。总之，你的娱乐和消遣也是与工作分不开的，特别是这四五年来，你是革命队伍中的倔强的耕牛，不声不响的埋头工作着。
