　　Supporting the Front Lines with Action
　　Our Newspaper Printing Plant's Youth Workers Competition
　　Typesetting Room Sets Unprecedented Record
　　[Our Dispatch] The entire staff of our newspaper printing plant held a gathering and discussion on the Mid-Autumn Festival to discuss production plans and how to train young workers. Mooncakes, grapes, and pomegranates were displayed on the table, and everyone wore joyful smiles, filling the room with a cheerful atmosphere. After Plant Director Mou spoke about the guiding principles for launching the youth worker movement, various directors and workers announced their work plans. Cao Youlin, Director of the Typesetting Department, first announced their group production plan, then stated that they would patiently train apprentices so they could quickly learn the skills. The Engraving Department guaranteed that the characters would be engraved correctly, and the size would be uniform. Old worker Song Liangzhen expressed his willingness to devote all his energy to helping apprentices quickly master the engraving techniques. Guo Zhenzhong, an engraving apprentice, planned to learn to write and understand artistic characters by the end of the year and challenged Fan Shoutian. Fan immediately accepted the challenge and said he would write down his plan and competition conditions and post them on the "Support the Front Lines" bulletin board as a goal to strive for. The Stereotyping Department guaranteed that the plates would be deep, and the titles would not be heavy, moved, or have incorrect characters. The Machine Room would also ensure clear printing and timely publication. Ma Songzhen, Director of the Trade Union, proposed not to be conservative and to fully teach the apprentices all the techniques he had learned. The speeches at the meeting were extremely enthusiastic, demonstrating the willingness of every worker to strive to improve their skills in the youth movement. After discussing the plan, entertainment began. Everyone was energized and full of enthusiasm, singing Peking opera and Yangko dances, reveling until late at night, and dispersing happily.
　　[Another Dispatch] Since the Typesetting Department proposed supporting the front lines with practical actions and set a plan and group production, output has increased unprecedentedly. On the 11th, they typeset two pages, four editions, of "The People's Army" and two pages of materials, totaling about 53,000 characters, exceeding the production of six people, creating the highest record since the establishment of the factory.
