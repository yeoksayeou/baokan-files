　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 22nd: The rear areas of Jiang's occupied territories are empty, and local militia and guerrillas are constantly attacking, scoring repeated victories. On the 1st of this month, a unit of the local armed forces of Xuefeng and Woyang counties in the 8th Sub-district of Suwan, attacked the 3rd Battalion of the National Soldier Training Corps of Jiang's army, which occupied Longshan, Tasha, and other places on both sides of the Fei River. After two hours of fighting, the entire battalion was annihilated, killing 64 Jiang soldiers, including the battalion commander Ge Guanglin, and capturing 81 people. Two light machine guns, 122 rifles, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and other military supplies were seized. The nearby Jiang's troops fled in panic, and more than a dozen villages and towns occupied by Jiang's troops on both sides of the Fei River were all recovered. On the 3rd of this month, the local armed forces of Pixian and Suining counties in the 7th Sub-district of Suwan, ambushed a battalion of Jiang's army that was invading southwest from Tushan Town (a railway station on the Longhai Railway and the Grand Canal), killing and wounding more than ten Jiang soldiers, and the remaining troops were forced to retreat. On the 10th, the Suining local armed forces, at Luoshan, southwest of Suining, crushed Jiang's "Da Lijia District Team" and the puppet "Armed Home Return Regiment," capturing alive its district captain Shan Danzhong, captain Zhang Jingzhi, and other officers and soldiers and "Home Return Regiment" members, totaling 14 people, killing and wounding 25 of them, and seizing 25 rifles. Two regiments of the Jiang army's newly formed 22nd Brigade crossed the Yangtze River from Jiangyin on August 16th and landed at Bawagang, southwest of Jingjiang, in an attempt to reinforce Huangqiao (Huangqiao was recovered by the New Fourth Army on August 31st). The local militia immediately destroyed the highway leading to Huangqiao, blocking the Jiang's troops back to Jingjiang City, and repeatedly ambushed the Jiang's puppet troops who went to the countryside to loot grain under the city.

    进袭淝河两岸歼蒋军自余
    【新华社淮阴二十二日电】蒋军侵占区后方空虚，各地民兵游击队不断出击，屡获胜利。本月一日，苏皖八分区雪（枫）涡（阳）县地方武装一部，袭击侵占淝河两岸龙山、塔山等地之蒋军国民兵部集训第三大队，经两小时战斗，将该队全部消灭，击毙蒋军大队长葛广林以下六十四人，俘八十一人，缴获轻机枪两挺步枪一百二十二枝，子弹两千发，其他军用品甚多。附近蒋军闻风奔逃，淝河两岸被蒋军侵占之村镇十余处，全告恢复。本月三日，苏皖七分区邳（县）睢（宁）县地方武装，阻击由土山镇（陇海路运河车站）西南出犯之蒋军一个营，毙伤蒋军十余名，余部被迫退走。十日睢宁地方武装于睢宁西南之罗山地方，击溃蒋记“大李家区队”及伪“武装还乡团”，生俘其区队长单箪中、队长张景之等官兵及“还乡团”员共十四名，毙伤其二十五名，缴获步枪二十五支。蒋军新编第二十二旅所属两个团，于八月十六日由江阴渡江，于靖江西南八圩港登陆，企图增援黄桥（按黄桥已于八月三十一日为新四军收复），当地民兵即将通往黄桥之公路加以破坏，将该部蒋军阻回靖江城，并屡予该城下乡抢粮之蒋伪军以伏击。
