Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: Shanghai airmail reports: Since May, large quantities of American goods have poured into large and small cities such as Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi'an from coastal areas such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, the crisis in China's national industry has deepened and is now facing collapse. The backbone of national industry, the cotton textile industry, from the "state-owned" China Textile Construction Corporation to major private factories, now relies on American cotton. At the same time, as American cloth has begun to be imported, the cotton textile industry is also facing a serious threat. In Shanghai alone, 40% of weaving factories have stopped work, and industries such as handkerchiefs, knitwear, underwear, and towels are also closing down and reducing production. Of more than 1,000 manual cotton textile businesses, less than one-third remain. Cigarette factories in various places have been hit hardest by American goods, and 90% of cigarette factories in Guangzhou and Shaoguan have closed. In Tianjin, 152,000 cartons of American cigarettes were imported in May, June, and July, immediately causing more than 40 local cigarette factories to close. 80% of Chongqing's cigarette factories have closed, and all 323 cigarette factories in Chengdu have collapsed. The coal industry is unable to compete with American gasoline, the latter's price being cheaper than boiled water, thus two-thirds of Shanghai's 60-plus coal briquette businesses have closed. Well-known national industries such as Qixin Cement, Yongli Alkali, and Wu Yun's monosodium glutamate and electric light industries are under the same severe attack. Qixin Cement now produces only more than 100 tons per day, only one-third of its original output, and Yongli Alkali produces only eight tons per day, only one-twentieth of its past output. More than half of Shanghai's 150-plus chemical factories have suspended operations. Other industries such as hardware, canned goods, watches, papermaking, glass, milk powder, and enamelware are all threatened by American goods and are on the verge of bankruptcy. Industrialists say painfully: "American commodities are like nitric acid; wherever they flow, there is rot, machines rust, and workers lose their jobs!" Currently, due to the industrial crisis, 300,000 workers in Shanghai alone have lost their jobs.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Shanghai reports: Exports of raw silk, tea, bristles, tung oil, and wool have not improved due to the Executive Yuan's new measures of raising foreign exchange and exempting export taxes. The price of American raw silk immediately decreased after this new measure, causing the cost of domestic raw silk to still be higher than the foreign selling price. Tung oil, bristles, tea, etc., have not had their costs reduced because of rising domestic prices. Another reason hindering exports is the stagnation of transportation. Currently, native products such as hides, bristles, and tung oil are piled up like mountains in Tianjin, Hankou, and Chongqing and cannot be transported out. The Kuomintang comprador bureaucrats' Central Trust Bureau takes advantage of the urgent need of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises to sell finished products, implementing control over raw silk and reaping huge profits from it.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to Tianjin Yi Shi Bao: The Qingdao market is extremely sluggish. Between July and August, a total of 80 businesses closed down one after another, including many stores that had been operating for more than 20 years. In terms of industry, most private factories have closed down, except for those that are state-owned. It is reported that of the city's 48,000 workers, more than 20,000 have lost their jobs.

　　美货潮涌国民党区
　　民族工商业倒闭日众
　　津汉渝等地土货堆积难脱售国民党官僚资本乘机渔巨利
    【新华社延安二十三日电】上海航讯：从五月份起，大批美货自沿海的上海、广州一带涌入平津及重庆、成都、西安等大小城市后，中国民族工业危机日益加深，现已面临崩溃局面。民族工业的基干——棉纺织业，从“国营”的中国纺织建设公司，直到各大民营工厂，现都仰给于美棉。同时由于美布已开始输入，棉纺织业跟着受到严重威胁。上海一地，织布厂停工的即达百分之四十，手帕、针织、内衣、毛巾等业，亦在纷纷关门减产之中。手工棉纺织业一千多家，现仅存不足三分之一。各地香烟工厂遭到美货打击最为严重，广州、韶关烟厂都倒闭了十分之九。天津在五、六、七三个月中，美国香烟进口十五万二千条，立使当地烟厂倒闭四十余家。重庆烟厂倒了百分之八十，成都三百二十三家烟厂已全部垮台。煤业已无力与美国汽油相竞争，后者的价格比开水还便宜，因之上海煤球业六十余家，停业三分之二。著名之民族工业如启新洋灰、永利纯碱及吴蕴初的味精、电灯工业，在同样的严重打击下。启新洋灰现仅日产百余吨，只及原产量三分之一，永利纯碱亦仅日产八吨，只及过去产量二十分之一。上海化学工厂一百五十多家，半数以上停顿了。他如五金、罐头、钟表、造纸、玻璃、奶粉、搪瓷等业，均在美货威胁与破产之境。工业家们沉痛的说：“美国商品如硝强水一样，它流到那里，那里就腐烂，那里的机器就生锈，那里的工人就失业！”目前因工业危机，失业的工人仅上海一地，即达三十万人。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】沪讯：生丝、茶、猪鬃、油桐、羊毛的出口，并未因行政院提高外汇及免征出口税的新手段而好转。美国生丝价格，接着这一新办法以后，立刻降低，因使国内生丝成本仍然高过国外售价。桐油、猪鬃、茶等，则因国内物价上涨，成本仍未减低。另为阻碍出口的原因，是交通停滞，目前天津、汉口、重庆土货如皮张、猪鬃、桐油等，均堆积如山，不能运出。国民党买办官僚们的中央信托局，乘中小工商业家成品急需脱售之生机，实行对生丝的统治，从中博得巨利。
    【新华社延安十九日电】据天津益世报载：青岛市面异常萧条，七八两月间，共有八十家商号相继歇业，其中包括经营二十余年之商店多家。工业方面除国营者外，民营工厂大部倒闭。据悉：全市四万八千工人中，失业者已达两万以上。
