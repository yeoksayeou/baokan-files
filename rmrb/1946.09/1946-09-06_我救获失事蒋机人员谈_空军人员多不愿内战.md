　　My Account of Rescuing Personnel from a Crashed Chiang Plane
    Many Air Force Personnel Are Unwilling to Engage in Civil War
    [Jiaozuo Dispatch, September 2nd] Mr. Li Lenian and Mr. Yu Ruifu, pilots of a Chiang Kai-shek aircraft (belonging to the 42nd Squadron of the 11th Air Group) who were forced to land in the North Henan Liberated Area on August 19th due to getting lost, arrived in Jiaozuo City on August 22nd after being rescued by our military and civilians. Our reporter made a special visit. Both gentlemen are lieutenants and have served in the Air Force for eight years. According to them, most of the officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force joined the Air Force to resist Japan and save the country, and two-thirds are unwilling to engage in civil war, hoping for peace. They believe that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are evenly matched in strength, and that peaceful negotiation is the only way to solve domestic problems. They also said that ideological control in the Air Force is extremely strict, causing great distress. When asked about the preferential treatment of Air Force families by the National Government, Mr. Yu Ruifu could not help but smile bitterly and said, "Air Force instructor Zhao Fan sacrificed himself in a plane crash, but his old mother committed suicide due to financial difficulties, and his wife remarried. One can imagine the situation of others." Speaking of their impressions of the Liberated Area, the two gentlemen said: "We didn't understand much at first, but we saw that everyone was happy and active, the military and civilians cooperated, worked hard, and the officers and soldiers of the troops were equal, which we greatly admire."

　　我救获失事蒋机人员谈
    空军人员多不愿内战
    【本报焦作二日电】八月十九日因迷失方向，被迫在豫北解放区降落之蒋机飞行员（属十一航空队四十二中队）李乐年、俞瑞辅两先生，经我军民营救，于八月二十二日到达焦作市。记者特往访问。两先生均中尉阶级，服务空军均已八年。据谈蒋军空军将士，多系因抗日救国而参加空军，三分之二均不愿内战，希望和平。认为国共双方势均力敌，只有和平协商为解决国内问题唯一途径，并谈空军中思想统治极严，苦闷不堪。谈及国民政府对空军家属优待如何，俞瑞辅先生不禁苦笑地说：“航校教官赵凡因架机牺牲，老母竟因生活困难自杀，妻亦改嫁，其他可想而知。”说到对解放区观感，两先生称：初来不甚了解，唯见一般人均愉快活跃，军民合作，刻苦耐劳，部队官兵平等，极表钦佩。
