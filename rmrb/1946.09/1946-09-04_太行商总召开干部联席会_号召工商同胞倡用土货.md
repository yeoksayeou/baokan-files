　　Taihang General Chamber of Commerce Holds Cadre Joint Meeting
    Calling on Industrial and Commercial Compatriots to Advocate the Use of Local Goods
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang District Chamber of Commerce Federation held a joint meeting of general, branch, and city chambers of commerce cadres in the middle of this month, with more than ten participants. After four or five days of reports and enthusiastic discussions, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce Federation should call on industrial and commercial compatriots in the Liberated Areas and the Great Rear Area to unite, resist foreign goods, and advocate the use of local goods; regulate the market and stabilize prices; register merchants' existing foreign goods, sell them within a limited time, and help merchants change careers. Finally, Director Li of the Administrative Office spoke, first analyzing the current economic struggle situation, explaining that the struggle is long-term and complex, and we should adopt the principle of self-reliance and not rely on foreign aid to carry out a production self-salvation movement. Then, he pointed out the future work direction: 1. The Chamber of Commerce Federation should educate merchants to face the countryside, serve the countryside, and serve the workers, and carry out a movement to promote the sale of local goods, so that industry and commerce have the conditions of sufficient raw materials, good quality, high output, low cost, and wide sales channels, laying the foundation for self-reliance. 2.机关生产、公营商店应该参加商联会，成为领导核心和执行政策的模范。2. Government agencies engaged in production and state-owned stores should participate in the Chamber of Commerce Federation and become the leading core and model for implementing policies. 3. Call on unemployed industrial and commercial compatriots in stubborn areas to invest in or operate factories in the Liberated Areas to develop our district's economic construction. 4. The relationship between owners and employees should be improved based on the principle of mutual benefit. 5. Store employee unions should have direct contact with the Chamber of Commerce Federation.

　　太行商总召开干部联席会
    号召工商同胞倡用土货
    【本报长治讯】太行区商联总会于本月中旬召开总分市会干部联席会议，与会者十余人。经过四五天的汇报与热烈的讨论，确定了商联会今后要号召解放区及大后方工商同胞们，一致团结起来，抵制外货倡用土货；调剂市场，平抑物价；登记商人现存外货，限期出卖，帮助商人转业。最后，行署李主任讲话，首先分析了目前经济斗争形势，说明斗争是常期而复杂的，我们应采取自力更生不依外援的原则，开展生产自救运动。继即指出今后工作方针：一、商联会应教育商人面向农村，为农村服务，为工人服务，开展推销土货运动，使工商业具备原料够、质量好、产量多、成本低、销路广的条件，为自力更生打下基础。二、机关生产、公营商店应该参加商联会，成为领导核心和执行政策的模范。三、号召顽占区失业的工商同胞到解放区投资或经营工厂，发展我区经济建设事业。四、东伙关系应本着东伙两利的原则改善。五、店员工会应与商联会发生直接连系。  （赵桐封、高萍）
