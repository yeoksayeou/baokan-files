　　[News from Changzhi, 27th by this newspaper] The Taihang Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "Overcome Financial Chaos and Guarantee Victory in the Self-Defense War," which stated in part: If financial chaos is not overcome, it will not only undermine the system, reduce national income, corrupt cadres, and affect unity, but also undermine the financial policy of unified planning and balanced revenue and expenditure. If budget estimates and final accounts cannot be accurately implemented, the people's burden will be increased, military supplies will not be guaranteed, and the self-defense war will be affected, as well as the construction and consolidation of the liberated areas. The editorial further pointed out: The ideological root of the chaos is that some cadres believe they should enjoy themselves after victory, while ignoring the new difficulties and the long-term arduousness of the Chinese revolution, even becoming complacent and arrogant, thinking that the situation was opened up by themselves and everything should be controlled by themselves, thus undermining the system and fostering corruption. Secondly, there is departmentalism, emphasizing the special, resulting in a financial separatist situation. The way to overcome this is to first strengthen ideological education, so that they realize that after a long period of war in the liberated areas, the people are exhausted and in urgent need of recovery. If we do not economize, we cannot reduce the people's burden and improve their lives. Various constructions cannot be developed, and the victory of the patriotic self-defense war and the victory of the national liberation and revolutionary cause are also difficult to imagine. Our Taihang area is poor, and only by tightening our belts and accumulating capital can we develop economic construction and resist the economic offensive of imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie. Only when the military and civilians of the entire region unite and develop the tradition of hard work, and ensure the supply to the front line, can we win the victory of the self-defense war. The editorial called on every cadre to conduct an ideological self-examination, and not to damage the noble qualities of the revolution because of temporary material desires. It also suggested that all levels of organs in the region should conduct a rapid inspection, and deal with existing problems in the spirit of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones. The editorial concluded: We should greatly promote the fine traditions of hard struggle, frugality, and honesty in public service during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. We should carefully plan every bowl of congee, every grain of rice, every half thread, and overcome new difficulties to win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war.

　　一粥一饭当思来处不易
    【本报长治二十七日讯】太行新华日报以《克服财政混乱现象，保证自卫战争胜利》为题，发表社论，略称：财政混乱现象如不克服，不仅破坏制度，减少国家收入，腐蚀干部，影响团结，而且破坏统筹统支量入为出的财政政策。预决算不能准确执行，使人民负担加重，军需供给失却保证，影响自卫战争，亦影响解放区的建设巩固。社论继指出：混乱之思想根源为，某些干部认为胜利后应该享受，而对新的困难，中国革命的长期艰苦性忽视，甚至居功自傲，以为局面由自己打开，一切皆应由自己支配，而破坏制度，助长贪污。其次则为本位主义，强调特殊，致造成财政上的割据局面。克服办法，首先加强思想教育，使其认识解放区在长期战争之后，人民疲惫急待恢复，我们不节约不能减轻人民负担，改善其生活。各项建设也无从发展，爱国自卫战的胜利与民族解放和革命事业的胜利，也很难想象。我们太行区地区贫脊，只有节衣缩食，积累资本，才能发展经济建设，抗拒帝国主义与买办资产阶级的经济进攻。也只有全区军民上下一致发展艰苦传统，保证前线供给，才能赢得自卫战争的胜利。社论号召每一干部进行思想检查，不要因一时的物质欲望而伤损革命的崇高品质。并建议全区各级机关迅速检查，以惩前毖后精神处理现存之问题。社论结语称：我们应大大发扬八年抗战艰苦奋斗，节衣缩食、廉洁奉公的优良传统，一粥一饭半丝半缕均应打算周到，战胜新的困难，赢得爱国自卫战争的胜利。
