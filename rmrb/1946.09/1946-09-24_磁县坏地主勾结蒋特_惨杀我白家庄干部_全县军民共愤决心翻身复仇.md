[Cixian Special Dispatch] Cixian's Baijiazhuang traitorous secret agent landlords Wu Gairen, Dou Guifang, and others colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's agents in Anyang to create a bloody tragedy, arousing boundless anger among the military and civilians of the county. Wu and others consistently oppressed and exploited the masses, conducting a dark rule in the village. When the overthrow movement began, they colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's agents in Anyang, disrupting mass movements in every way possible, with the result that although the village underwent a struggle, the broad masses were not mobilized. Last month, after investigation and rent reduction, the county-wide movement re-entered a high tide. The rebels Wu and Dou, deeply fearing that their towering crimes deserving of death would be thoroughly settled by the masses, intensified their actions and struck first, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's agents in Anyang to create this bloody tragedy that enraged both humans and gods.

On the midnight of the 8th of this month, the rebels Wu, Dou and others brought in more than two hundred armed Chiang Kai-shek's agents from Anyang, rushed into the village, sneaked into the house of village chief Wu Baozhen, and slaughtered the village chief Wu, his white-haired old mother, his wife who was in confinement, and his infant who was less than a month old, killing the entire family. Seven of the eight members of the family of village cadre Bai Huai were killed, and Bai's eighty-year-old grandmother was killed despite her pleas. Five of the six production team members of the ××× regiment were killed tragically, and one was seriously injured.

After the tragic news spread, all the military and civilians in Cixian were filled with grief and indignation. The county government and various agencies immediately organized condolence groups to go to mourn and carry out the aftermath, and held a tragic memorial meeting on the 13th, calling on the masses to transform grief into strength, to avenge the dead. The county peasant association representative proposed to the masses in the village: "We must thoroughly overthrow and realize that tillers own their land to comfort the dead." He said, "The more the special agents sabotage, the more thoroughly we must overthrow." The militia of the Second District also proposed to the masses in the village: "If everyone unites closely, we will have strength, and we must avenge our dead fathers and brothers!" At present, the masses of Baijiazhuang are brewing a struggle with indignant feelings, vowing to recover the blood debt and thoroughly overthrow and take revenge.
