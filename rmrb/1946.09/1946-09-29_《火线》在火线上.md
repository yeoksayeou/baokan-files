　　"Frontline" on the Frontlines
    When a certain regiment was fighting on the Longhai Front, it published a mimeographed newspaper called "Frontline." Its advantage lay in its quick and timely reflection of the lives, heroic stories, and model figures of the frontline soldiers. Moreover, most of the articles were written by those who had personally participated in the fighting, making it very popular among the officers and soldiers. Often, as soon as the unit moved and the telephone was set up, they would receive inquiries from the营 instructors saying, "Hey, is 'Frontline' out yet?" Once, after a certain company captured the invading army's maps and documents, the soldiers all said, "Send them to the 'Frontline' newspaper!" Upon receiving them, "Frontline" immediately wrote an article titled "Extremely Useful," which attracted everyone's attention.
    The reason this mimeographed newspaper became the core of wartime morale boosting and troop education is inseparable from the efforts of Education Section Chief Comrade Lu Yu. Throughout the entire Longhai Campaign, he even disregarded his luggage and personally carried the steel printing plate, wax paper, and ink, persisting in publishing the newspaper on the battlefield. Once, the battle was extremely fierce, bullets whistled in the low sky, and artillery shells stirred up waves of smoky dust nearby. However, Comrade Lu Yu remained calm and etched his wax stencil in the command post. Later, when American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes bombed the command post, he merely moved to another location and continued to etch in the sorghum field. "Frontline" newspaper met with everyone issue after issue, and has now reached its eighth issue.

　　《火线》在火线上
    某团在陇海前线作战时，出版一个油印小报叫作《火线》，它的好处在于迅速及时的反映了前方战士们生活、英勇故事和模范人物，而且大部稿件都出自亲身作战者的手笔，很受干部战士们的欢迎。往往当部队移动后刚把电话架上时，便接到营教导员们的询问说：“喂，《火线》又出来了吗？”有一次某连缴获进犯军的地图和文件后，战士们都说“送给《火线》报吧”。《火线》接到后马上以“大大有用”为题写了篇文章，引起了大家的注意。
    这个油印小报之所以成为战时鼓励士气，教育部队的核心，是与教育股长鲁鱼同志的努力分不开的，他在整个陇海战役时期中，甚至连行李都不顾，亲自背着钢版、腊纸和油墨，在战地上坚持着出小报，有次战斗非常激烈，流弹在低空中呼啸，炮弹在左近掀起一阵阵烟土，鲁鱼同志却仍沉着地在指挥所里刻他的腊版，后来美制蒋机轰炸指挥所时，他仅仅移动了一下地方，又在高粱地里刻起来了。《火线》报就这样一期期地和大家见面，现在已出到第八期了。
