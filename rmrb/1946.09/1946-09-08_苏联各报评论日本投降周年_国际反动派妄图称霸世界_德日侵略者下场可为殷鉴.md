Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Moscow dispatch: Soviet newspapers published editorials on September 3rd, commenting on the anniversary of Japan's surrender. The New Times magazine's 17th issue editorial stated: The Red Army played a significant role in defeating Japan, accelerating the end of the Far East War, but currently, Japan's implementation of the Potsdam Declaration is encountering various obstacles created by the American military authorities. The American military authorities have approved Japan's anti-democratic new constitution, resolutely hindering the implementation of all democratic reforms, and blatantly attempting to preserve Japan's military strength and turn Japan into a base for carrying out various adventures.

The New Times magazine continued: In the past year, the colonial powers have violated their promises and continued their wars against the people of those regions for independence and liberation. The Kuomintang reactionaries, with American assistance, have launched a large-scale civil war, ruining China's independence. The editorial pointed out that Britain and the Netherlands in Indonesia, the United States in the Philippines, France in Annam, and Britain in India and Southeast Asia are all trying to maintain colonial rule. American and British troops are still stationed in non-enemy countries or member states of the United Nations such as China, Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Denmark, and Norway, which is by no means conducive to promoting peace in Europe and Asia. The New Times magazine concluded: The international situation after the Second World War is far from what it used to be, and the development of democratic movements in various countries is an important fact that cannot be ignored.

Izvestia stated: On the occasion of celebrating the anniversary of Japan's surrender, just like in the difficult days of the war, the Soviet Union is still advancing in the vanguard of progressive humanity. International reactionaries are trying to seize positions to realize their dream of winning world hegemony and dreaming of new wars. They are using the remnants of German fascists and Japanese militarists. The lessons learned by the German and Japanese aggressors are a warning to those who hide new war plans. Izvestia concluded: The Soviet people are working tirelessly to further strengthen their country's economic and military strength, making it stronger and more powerful, and able to become a fully armed warrior for world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Moscow Radio on the 2nd reviewed the situation in the Far East, citing a commentary from the New Times magazine, mentioning Japan's defeat a year ago and the anti-fascist war of aggression carried out in the name of national freedom, equality, and the right of all nations to establish a life they deem suitable. Its goals are far from complete because the Japanese ruling clique, with the blessing of the occupying authorities, is effectively hindering democratic reforms. It continued: The American reactionary groups have made no secret of their plans to save the Japanese militarists and transfer Japan to these militarists for future malicious conspiracies. The New Times magazine then pointed out the following facts: 1. The reactionary Kuomintang group, with the support of the United States, has launched an attack on democratic forces. They will not hesitate because of the prospect of a cruel civil war, which will endanger China's independence. 2. In Indonesia, British troops are continuing their war against 70 million people fighting for freedom. 3. In the Philippines, the authorities are using force to suppress the guerrilla movement that arose during the Japanese occupation.

　　苏联各报评论日本投降周年
    国际反动派妄图称霸世界         
    德日侵略者下场可为殷鉴
    【新华社延安四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联各报于九月三日发表社论，评论日本投降一周年日。新时代杂志第十七期社论称：红军在击溃日本中起了重大的作用，加速了远东战争的结束，但现时日本实行波茨顿宣言的条件，正在遇到美军当局所造成的种种障碍。美军当局批准了日本的反民主新宪法，坚决阻碍一切民主改革的实行，露骨的想保存日本的军事力量，把日本变成进行各种冒险的根据地。
    新时代杂志继称：一年以来，统治殖民地各列强违背自己的诺言，竟继续着反对各该地人民独立解放的战争。国民党反动派在美国帮助下已展开大规模的内战，断送中国的独立。该社论指出英荷在印尼、美国在菲律滨、法国在安南、英国在印度及亚洲东南部都力图保存殖民地的统治，美英军队迄今仍驻在中国、希腊、埃及、伊拉克、丹麦、挪威等非敌国或联合国会员国之境内，绝不是促进欧亚走上和平的道路。新时代杂志结语称：二次战后的国际形势已远非昔比，各国民主运动的发展是一重要事实，绝不能忽视的。
    消息报称：庆祝日本投降一周年之际，正如在严重的战争时日一样，苏联仍旧在进步人类的先锋队中迈进。国际反动派正图攫取地位以实现他们赢得世界霸权，梦想着新的战争，他们正利用德国法西斯分子与日本军阀残余。德日侵略者所受到的教训，乃是对那些隐藏新战争计划者的一个警告。消息报结语称：苏联人民正在不倦地工作，更加加强他们国家的经济与军事力量，使他更加坚强与有力，能够成为全副武装的全世界的和平战士。
    【新华社延安三日电】莫斯科广播二日检讨远东形势，引新时代杂志评论，提及一年以前日本的失败以及在各民族自由平等及各民族有建立其认为适合的生活的权利名义下所进行的反法西斯侵略战争，其目的远未完成，因为日本统治集团在占领当局的赐福之下，正在有效地阻碍民主改革。继称：美国反动派集团对于他们救护日本军阀的计谋，以及将日本转至这些军阀手中，以便将来进行恶毒的阴谋并无所隐蔽。新时代杂志继即指出下面的事实：一、反动的国民党集团，在美国的支持下，已经向民主力量发动进攻，他们是不会因为残酷的内战前途而忌惮不前的，这种内战将危害中国的独立。二、在印度尼西亚，英国军队正在继续他们的战争，反对为自由而斗争的七千万人民。三、在菲律滨，当局正在使用武力镇压在日本期间所兴起的游击运动。
