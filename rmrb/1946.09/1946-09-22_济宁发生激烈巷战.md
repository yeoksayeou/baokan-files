Xinhua News Agency, Tengxian, 19th: Fierce fighting is unfolding in Jining city, southwestern Shandong. Wu Huawen, a puppet and traitor entrenched in Yanzhou city on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, in coordination with Chiang Kai-shek's troops invading the Yutai and Jinxiang areas west of Weishan Lake, led over a thousand troops on the 15th under the cover of an American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, advancing southwest towards Jining city. On the 16th, they invaded the East Gate, North Gate, and South Gate. The local Eighth Route Army, in coordination with the broad masses of militiamen and residents within the city, engaged in fierce street fighting with the puppets. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek's 97th Army under Wang Hangwen from Lincheng, in response to the actions of Wu Huawen's troops, gathered over 2,700 men and harassed the northwest of the city, but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army. Furthermore: The main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 59th Division (military reorganization designation) occupying Taierzhuang, consisting of over 5,000 men, invaded northeast along the Tai'erzhuang-Lanling Highway on the 5th, and were counterattacked by the Eighth Route Army and militiamen, and fled back to Taierzhuang the same day.
