Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. A United Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th stated: "American diplomatic officials have widely divergent opinions and are fiercely debating Bevin's speech in Stuttgart. In the debate, those who advocate compromise with the Soviet Union oppose those who advocate a 'bold diplomacy' towards the Soviet Union. Those who once advocated a tough peace with Germany sharply criticized Bevin's speech, as did those who advocate a compromise with the Soviet Union. They say that Bevin's speech actually abandoned the Potsdam Agreement, the main points of which are: (1) The four powers have not yet reached an agreement on treating Germany as an economic unit. However, Bevin said that the U.S. occupation zone will be economically unified with those willing to cooperate, and he may have ended the efforts of the four powers to jointly solve the German problem. (2) Some parts of Bevin's speech were mainly to win the favor of Germany and oppose the Soviet Union. (3) The impact of the speech may force the Soviet Union to become increasingly isolated from Western countries economically and politically. Bevin's supporters (undoubtedly including Truman and most senior officials of the State Department) admit that, in terms of its significance, Bevin's speech is indeed a departure from the Potsdam Agreement.

　　美外交官员
    争辩颇烈
    【新华社延安十二日电】据美联社华府十日电称：“美国外交官员对于贝纳斯在斯图加特的讲演，意见分歧争辩颇烈。辩论中主张对苏妥协者反对主张对苏采取“大胆外交”。曾经主张对德强硬和平的人民，尖锐的抨击贝纳斯的演说，主张对苏采取妥协态度的人，也是如此。他们说贝氏演说中实际上放弃了波茨顿三强公约，其要点有：（一）目前四强对于把德国作为经济单位看待还没有获致协议。而贝氏却说美国占领区将在经济上和愿意合作的统一，他可能已结束于四强共同解决德国问题努力。（二）贝氏演说中某些部分主要是为了得到德国的欢心反对苏联。（三）演说之影响，可能迫使苏联在经济上和政治上愈和西方国家隔绝。贝纳斯之支持者（无疑问地包括杜鲁门及国务院大多数高级官员）承认就意义上来讲，贝氏演说确是背离了波茨顿协议。
