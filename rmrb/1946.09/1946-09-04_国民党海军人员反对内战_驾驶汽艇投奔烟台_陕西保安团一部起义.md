　　Kuomintang Navy Personnel Oppose Civil War
    Steer Motorboats to Yantai
    Part of Shaanxi Security Regiment Mutinies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 30th] Kuomintang Navy personnel on the "Changzhi" warship, operating in the Bohai Sea, unwilling to be sacrificed by Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, steered the motorboats "De Shun Yong" and "Hai Lu Feng" to the Eighth Route Army on the 15th. The "Hai Lu Feng" is yet to arrive due to getting lost en route. The squad leader and five soldiers aboard the "De Shun Yong" motorboat arrived safely in Yantai on the 17th, where they were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. They were deeply moved and said, "We are unwilling to slaughter our compatriots, therefore we resolutely withdraw from the civil war!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st] Dong Ce-cheng, Major Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the Sixth Regiment of the Shaanxi Kuomintang Security Corps, led his troops in a mutiny, withdrawing from the civil war, and arrived safely in Malan, Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, a few days ago. Battalion Commander Dong is from Fengxiang, Shaanxi, and has been in the military for twenty years, fighting bloody battles to defend the territory in Taihang during the Anti-Japanese War. However, under the policy of the warmonger Hu Zongnan, who actively expanded his personal power to eliminate local armed forces in the Northwest, he was once detained for insufficient "anti-communism". Recently, Hu Zongnan dispatched the 48th Brigade in an attempt to disarm the unit. Battalion Commander Dong could no longer tolerate it and was forced to revolt in Zhang Hongzhen, Chaoyi, on the 17th of this month. After the uprising, the Chiang army pursued them without success. When the unit arrived in the Border Region, more than a thousand people from all walks of life in Malan gathered on the banks of the Malan River, carrying fruits, cigarettes and paper to greet them. The masses cheered along the road and held a grand welcome meeting.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fengzhen, 30th] A squad of Chiang's army led by squad leader Liu Yong-sheng, consisting of eight soldiers, stationed in Taolin, defected to the liberated area on July 14th, bringing six rifles, more than two hundred rounds of ammunition, and fifteen horses and donkeys. They volunteered to return home to farm. The Democratic Government of Taoji County warmly entertained them and issued each person a settlement allowance of 70,000 to 150,000 yuan.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 30th] Zhang Sishi, Major Deputy Regiment Commander of the First Regiment of the Provisional First Column of Chiang's army in Baoding, defected to the liberated area and arrived safely in Qingyuan County on the 19th. Zhang had long intended to break away from the reactionaries and has now achieved his wish. In the past half month, one hundred and fifty soldiers from the Chiang and puppet troops stationed in Qing County, Cang County, and other places have deserted. Eight soldiers from a certain railway station of the Beining Railway deserted to the liberated area with eight rifles a few days ago.
