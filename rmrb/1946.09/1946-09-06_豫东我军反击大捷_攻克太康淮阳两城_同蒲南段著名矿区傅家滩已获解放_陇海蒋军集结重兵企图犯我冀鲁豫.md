    [Telegram from Our Frontline Correspondent on the Longhai Front, dated 4th] In order to strike at the counter-attacking Chiang Kai-shek troops along the Longhai Railway and to coordinate with local armed forces, our Eighth Route Army in eastern Henan recovered Taikang County seat (located over 200 li south of Qi County and over 200 li southeast of Tongxu) on August 29th, wiping out the local puppet security forces. We captured three light machine guns, two mortars, fifty rifles, and countless other spoils of war. This city was liberated by our army on September 22nd of last year and occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on October 5th. On the 2nd, our army took advantage of the victory to counterattack the puppet security regiment in Huaiyang City. The puppet troops entrenched in the city were quickly annihilated, and the inventory of captured goods is currently underway. This is the fourth county seat in eastern Henan liberated by our army since August 14th. Huaiyang is a relatively large city in eastern Henan, located on the north bank of the Huai River south of Taikang. It is only 30 kilometers away from Zhoujiakou, an important town in eastern Henan on the south bank of the Huai River. After the liberation of Huaiyang, the rear of the invading troops from Henan, Zhoujiakou, and the Pinghan Railway area were shaken.

    [Telegram from Our Correspondent in Yangcheng, dated 4th] The Wang Yucai unit of the Second Regiment of the 39th Division of the Yan Xishan puppet army (Wang Yucai was originally the Deputy Commander of the Puppet Hedongdao Security Headquarters) and part of the 208th Regiment, as well as over 1,000 mine police left by the Japanese invaders at the Fuchiatan coal mine, who had been surrounded by the Eighth Route Army at Fuchiatan, 40 li southwest of Lingshi, broke through and fled west in the late hours of the 1st. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our blocking forces on both sides of the Fen River. With this, Fuchiatan and its mining area, the last stronghold of the Yan Xishan puppet army on the section from Luqu east of Linfen to Jiexiu-Yitang, have been completely liberated. This area is one of the famous anthracite coal mining areas in Shanxi and the only major coal station on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. The enemy established a company to exploit the mines during their occupation.

    [Telegram from Our Frontline Correspondent on the Longhai Front, dated 31st] On the 28th, a unit of our Eighth Route Army, in coordination with local militia, captured Lüyuanzi, located between Cao County, Kaocheng, and Minquan, capturing over 1,000 people including detachment leader Cui Zimin, over 1,000 rifles, over 30 light machine guns, and a large amount of ammunition. All the local despots, traitors, and secret agents who had fled from Cao County, Dingtao, and other counties to this place were rounded up. Cui's family in Lüyuanzi is the number one reactionary landlord in Henan, possessing over 1,000 hectares of land. Many villages within hundreds of li were within their sphere of influence. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, Cui Zimin, under the direction of the Japanese invaders, formed a traitorous armed force to massacre anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Cui's unit served as the vanguard of the invading troops stationed in Kaocheng, Minquan, and Shangqiu, directly carrying out Liu Ruming's mission of controlling the railway and invading the liberated areas. They were a major obstacle to the connection between the liberated areas north and south of the Longhai Railway. After Cui's stronghold in Lüyuanzi was destroyed, the people within hundreds of li were overjoyed and grateful to our army for eliminating a major scourge for the people in the area.

    [Telegram from Our Frontline Correspondent on the Longhai Front, dated 2nd] The Chiang Kai-shek troops counterattacking the central section of the Longhai Railway are continuing to increase their troop deployments. Currently, the Chiang Kai-shek troops directly participating in the battle along the Minquan-Lanfeng-Kaocheng-Changyuan line have reached 17 main regiments. Part of the 88th Division and the entire 18th Brigade of Fang Xianjue's troops stationed in the Xuzhou area, in coordination with stubborn puppet security teams and other local armed forces, captured Feng County on the 28th, following Pei County, and continue to invade the liberated area between Feng County and Shan County. The 104th Brigade of the 41st Division originally stationed in Chichang south of Kaifeng has arrived in Changyuan. The 122nd Brigade of this division has also advanced eastward to Hongmiao, south of Kaocheng. The Third Brigade of the Third Division and one regiment each from the 20th Brigade arrived in Kaocheng on the 28th and continued to advance northeast towards Mengzhai, Mafang, and Xinsheji. At the same time, the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division occupying the Yejigang Station west of Minquan advanced towards Wangqiao and Zhanglou, 15 li northeast of Minquan. The 181st Brigade and the remnants of the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division advanced from Shangqiu to Yanglou, 5 li west of the Liuheji Station, and Sunliukou and Zhao Zhuang, over 10 li northwest of it. Judging from their posture, it is clear that they intend to use the Longhai Railway as a base to launch a pincer attack on the vast areas of Shan County, Yutai, Jinxiang, Dingtao, Heze, and Dongming in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region.

　　豫东我军反击大捷
    攻克太康淮阳两城
    同蒲南段著名矿区傅家滩已获解放
    陇海蒋军集结重兵企图犯我冀鲁豫
    【本报陇海前线四日电】我豫东八路军为打击陇海沿线蒋军反扑，配合地方武装，于八月二十九日收复太康县城（位于杞县南二百余里，通许东南二百余里）将当地伪保安部队消灭。缴获轻机枪三挺，迫击炮二门，步枪五十支，其他胜利品无算。该城去年九月二十二日为我军解放，十月五日为蒋军所侵占。二日我军又乘胜向淮阳城伪保安团反击，盘踞该城之伪军，迅告歼灭，缴获正清查中。此为八月十四日以来我军所解放之豫东区第四座县城。按淮阳为豫东较大城市，位于太康以南淮河北岸，与淮河南岸之豫东重镇周家口相距不过三十公里，淮阳解放后，河南进犯军之后方周家口，及平汉沿线均为之震动。
    【本报阳城四日电】被八路军包围于灵石西南四十里傅家滩之阎伪军第三十九师二团王育才部（王育才原伪河东道保安总部副指挥）、二○八团一部，及日寇遗留于傅家滩煤矿矿警等千余人，于一日深夜突围西窜，正与我堵击部队激战于汾河两岸，至此，临汾东芦曲至介（休）义（棠）段阎伪军最后一个据点——傅家滩及其矿区已获完全解放。按该地为山西著名无烟煤矿区之一，同蒲铁路南段之唯一大煤站，敌寇盘踞时曾设公司开采。
    【本报陇海前线三十一日电】我八路军一部配合当地子弟兵于二十八日将曹县、考城、民权之间的吕园子攻破，俘虏支队长崔子民以下一千余人，步枪一千余支，轻机枪三十余挺，弹药甚多。将曹县、定陶等县逃至该处之恶霸汉奸特务一网打尽。按：吕园子崔家是河南第一家反动大地主，有土地一千多顷，附近数百里的许多村庄都是他们压榨的势力范围。抗战八年来，崔子民并在日寇指使下，组成汉奸武装，屠杀抗日军民。日寇投降后，崔部即充当盘踞考城、民权、商邱进犯军之先锋，直接执行刘汝明给予之控制铁路进犯解放区的使命，是我陇海路南北解放区联系之大障碍。崔逆据点吕园子被击破后，远近数百里老百姓，莫不欢欣鼓舞，感谢我军为该地广大人民除一大祸害。
    【本报陇海前线二日电】反扑陇海中段蒋军正继续增调部署中，现集结于民（权）兰（封）考（城）长（垣）一线直接参与作战之蒋军已达十七个主力团。驻徐州地区蒋军方先觉之八十八师一部与十八旅全部，配合顽伪保安团队等地方武装，继沛县之后，二十八日又陷我丰县，并继续进犯丰（县）单（县）之间解放区。原驻开封以南赤仓四一师之一○四旅，已开抵长垣，该师之一二二旅并向东推进至考城南面的红庙，第三师三旅及二十旅各一个团，二十八日进抵考城后，又继续向东北方之孟寨、马坊、新舍集一带推进。与此同时，占驻民权西野鸡岗车站的六十八师一一九旅，向民权东北十五里之王桥、张楼推进，五五师之一八一旅与七四旅残部，自商邱进至柳河集车站以西五里之杨楼及西北十余里之孙六口及赵庄一带。窥其态势，显系以陇海路为依托，钳形夹击我冀鲁豫单县、鱼台、金乡、定陶、荷泽、东明等广大地区。
