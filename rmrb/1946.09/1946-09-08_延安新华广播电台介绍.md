Domestic and foreign listeners attach great importance to XNCR broadcasts. A gentleman in Beiping once suggested: "Please broadcast more! It would be best to broadcast at least twelve hours a day." Recently, an American friend from West Virginia, USA, wrote to express his willingness to establish regular contact. The station's fixed daily programs include: domestic news, international news, and recorded news. Non-fixed programs include: radio commentary, domestic public opinion, international public opinion on Chinese issues, current affairs speeches, introductions to the Liberated Areas, introductions to CCP policies, correspondence, stories, novels, ballads, character introductions, music, etc. In addition, there are speeches by celebrities.
