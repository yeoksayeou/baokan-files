Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: TASS, Warsaw, 25th: General Grosz, Director of the Press Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared at a reception for reporters that the Polish government is studying the Anglo-American notes regarding the Polish elections. "But I can already say that our government is deeply surprised by the tendency shown in these two notes, especially the British note, to interfere in our internal affairs. There is no provision in any treaty guaranteed to be implemented in Poland for interference in our internal affairs, and it violates the principle of our sovereignty." In response to a question about the UK's delay in approving the agreement to return Polish gold, Grosz declared: "When the United States wants to exert pressure on our country, they use their own gold as a tool, but the United Kingdom uses Polish gold, which is illegally detained in the UK, as a tool to exert pressure."

    谴责英美干涉内政
    【新华社延安二十八日电】塔斯社华沙二十五日讯：波兰外交部新闻司司长格罗兹将军在招待记者会上宣称：波政府正研究美英关于波选举的照会，“但我已经可以说我国政府对于该两照会特别是英国的照会所表现的干涉我国内政的趋势深为诧异，对我国内政之干涉，在波兰所保证实行的任何条约中迄无规定，且与其主权原则相违反。”格罗兹在回答关于英国迄今为止迟不批准归还波兰黄金的协定问题时宣称：“当美国对我国要行施压力时，他们用他们自己的黄金作为工具，可是英国却以被非法扣押在英国的波兰黄金作为工具来行施压力。”
