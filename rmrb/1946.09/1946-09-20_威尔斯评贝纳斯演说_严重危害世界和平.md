　　Welles Comments on Byrnes' Speech
    Seriously Endangers World Peace
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th】 Associated Press, Washington: Former U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles (now a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company) criticized Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart in a broadcast on the 16th. He said, "The steps proposed by Byrnes regarding the handling of Germany contain serious dangers to world peace and universal security." Welles believes that Byrnes' advocacy of establishing a German central government "would give the German General Staff new agents," thus reviving the militarism that launched the war of aggression. He indicated that the hasty establishment of a central government "lacks the will of the German people themselves."

　　威尔斯评贝纳斯演说
    严重危害世界和平
    【新华社延安十七日电】美联社华盛顿讯：美前副国务卿威尔斯（现任国家广播司评论家）于十六日广播演说，批评美国务卿贝纳斯在斯图加特的演说。他说：“贝纳斯所提议的关于处理德国的各项步骤，包含着对于世界和平与普遍安全的严重的危害。”威尔斯认为贝纳斯所主张的成立德国中央政府，“会给予德国参谋部以新的代理人”，因而使曾经发动侵略战争的军国主义复活。他指示仓促建立中央政府是“缺乏德国人民自己的意志”。
