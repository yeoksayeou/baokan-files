　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Heze, 3rd] Li Rongcun, head of the Qi Bin Logistics Work Group in the Fifth Special District of Ji-Lu-Yu, achieved outstanding results in wartime work during the recent counter-attack for self-defense on the Longhai Line. The Administrative Office issued a special commendation. After the county-wide mobilization at the start of the battle, Comrade Li Rongcun personally led a stretcher team to the front lines to transport the wounded. During the execution of the mission, not a single one of the 260 stretchers in the team deserted, completing the arduous task of transporting the wounded to support the front lines. The reasons for his success were: first, he conducted in-depth propaganda, mobilization, and education work when initially mobilizing and organizing the stretcher team, along with careful organization of the stretcher team; second, throughout the entire mission (from departure to return), Comrade Rongcun endured the same hardships as the masses, and did not eat, drink, or rest when the masses did not, never separating himself from the masses; third, he carried out timely propaganda and mobilization work, consolidating and improving the morale of the masses; fourth, Comrade Rongcun set an example by taking turns with the masses to carry the stretchers and rest.
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Heze, 3rd] The emancipated stretcher brigade of Linhe District, Nanhua County, produced 108 war heroes in the recent counter-attack for self-defense in liberating Qixian County. The most outstanding team in the brigade was the Third Detachment. The old hero Liu Shunle of this detachment was nearly sixty years old, with a dark face and long, white beard. Also, Liu Xintian and Wang Guanqing, who were hunchbacked, were also old men in their fifties. On the night of the fifteenth, the sound of gunfire from the counter-attack rang out. They rescued the wounded in the face of artillery fire just like the young people. The artillery fire from the Chiang Kai-shek troops was exceptionally fierce, but they were not afraid. They carried thirteen wounded soldiers from the front line at night and transported ammunition three times. Liu Shunle was indeed somewhat tired. Comrade Hou Zesheng, the team leader, asked him to rest. He said unhappily, "If I rest a little longer, the wounded comrades will bleed a little longer. The battlefield is not the time for you to pity me!" When the army engaged in street fighting with the enemy in the city, they urgently carried the wounded soldiers out of the city until more than a thousand invading soldiers laid down their weapons. Only then did they return victoriously with joy.
    [Report from Our Newspaper in Heze, 3rd] During the tense counter-attack for self-defense on the Longhai Line, the units directly under the military region seized the gaps in the war to help the masses in the驻地 (zhùdì; garrison/station) with the autumn harvest. The chiefs of the departments and offices of the headquarters and political departments personally went to the fields to help the masses in the驻地 (zhùdì; garrison/station) harvest. The production morale of the masses was further improved by the assistance of the troops. An old man said to his son in front of Minister Liu of the Political Department, "Look, the minister is helping us himself. You have to work hard." The ×× Department stationed in Huazhuang, Guantao County, helped the whole village harvest the land of the families of those participating in the war within five days. In order to solve the difficulties of the families of the martyrs, soldiers, militia and stretcher transport teams, the counties have organized large-scale work exchanges throughout the villages to assist the families of soldiers and martyrs in a planned manner. Some villages have even stipulated substitute farming days to help the families of the martyrs and the militia participating in the war with the harvest. Zhang Silou Village divided into eighteen groups according to manpower and animal power, with every three groups helping one family of a participant in the war.

    【本报荷泽三日电】冀鲁豫五专区齐滨后勤工作组长李荣村，在此次陇海线自卫反击战中，战时工作成绩卓著。行署特通令表扬。战斗开始，全县动员后，李荣村同志亲身带领担架队赶赴前线，担任送运伤员任务，在执行任务过程中，担架队二百六十付没有一个逃亡，完成了担运伤员支援前线艰巨任务。他所以有这样的成绩：第一、在开始动员组织担架时有深入宣传动员教育工作，和担架队的周密组织。第二、在执行任务全部过程中（从出发到回来）荣村同志与群众同样艰苦，群众得不到吃饭喝水休息时，他也不吃饭喝水，一点也不脱离群众。第三、及时进行宣传鼓动工作，巩固与提高了群众情绪。第四、荣村同志以身作则，每次抬担架都与群众换班休息。
    【本报荷泽三日电】翻了身的南华县临河区担架大队，在此次解放杞县城的反击自卫战中，出现了一百零八名参战英雄，该大队最出色的是第三分队，该分队的老英雄刘顺乐，年纪近六十岁，乌黑脸，花白的长胡子，还有伛偻着背的刘心田、汪冠清也是五十多岁的老汉了。十五日深夜反击的枪声响了，他们和青年人一样冒着炮火抢救伤员，蒋军的炮火异常激烈，他们并不害怕，在夜里从火线上抬下十三次伤兵，运上去三次弹药，刘顺乐实在有些疲乏了，领队的侯泽生同志请他休息休息，他不高兴的说：“我多休息一会，负伤的同志会多流一会血，战场上不是你可怜我的时候啊！”军队在城内与敌人展开巷战，他们就从城内紧张的抬出伤兵，直到千余名进犯军放下了武器，他们才欢天喜地胜利而归。
    【本报荷泽三日电】在紧张的陇海自卫反击战中，军区直属队各单位抓紧战争空隙，帮助驻地群众秋收。司、政各部处长均亲自下地，给驻地群众收割。群众的生产情绪因部队的帮助更加提高，一位老先生对着政治部刘部长对他儿子说：“你看部长亲自来帮助咱，你可得好好干呐。”驻管陶县化庄的××部五天内即帮助村中将全村参战家属的地收完。各县为解决抗属民兵与担架运输队家中的困难，多组织全村大变工，有计划的互助优抗。有的村庄更规定代耕日，帮助抗属及参战民兵家属收割。张司楼全村按人力畜力划分十八个组，每三组帮助一家参战家属。
