Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 14th: The key ringleaders Jiang Pengfei, Li Mingxin, and Cui Dagang, who were arrested for plotting a riot in Harbin, were executed by firing squad on the 10th. Jiang's crimes were reported previously. The crimes of the traitors Li and Cui are reported as follows:

	Li Mingxin joined the heretical Nine Palace Golden Thread Great Way sect in Neiqiu, Hebei Province in the spring of 1927. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he used the guise of spreading the faith to travel to Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other places, spying on the Eighth Route Army for the enemy and puppets. In the spring of 1945, he went to Peiping (Beijing) and, together with Japanese secret agents Goto and Maekawa, established the "Jiang Dao Joint Association" in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Handan to conduct propaganda and gather intelligence for the enemy, recruiting more than 6,000 followers and organizing a spy network. After the Japanese surrendered, Li accepted the task of Chen Zhenjun and Qiu Junqing, subordinates of the great traitor Li Shousin, to recruit puppet troops and puppet security teams in Neiqiu, Hebei, organizing the bandit army "Central Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army Pioneer Second Route Army." Li served as a major general and advisor in the army, persecuting compatriots and disrupting security in the liberated areas. Subsequently, the traitor served in the intelligence work of the puppet army Xu Tieying's department. In January of this year, he went to Peiping again and accepted the task of Jiang Huguo (commander of the puppet Chinese Restoration Northeastern Founding Army), the head of the Kuomintang secret service, and the traitor Li Yuting (president of the Peiping Puhua Buddhist Association). He infiltrated the Northeast with Li Yuting, Bian Guori, and others, and was appointed as a military member of the Northeast Branch of the "Enemy-Occupied Area Work Committee" of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee. After arriving in Harbin, he recruited more than 5,000 henchmen, spread rumors, trained in martial arts, and organized a bandit army. On July 19th, he conspired with Jiang Pengfei and others to plan a riot. On August 26th, Jiang was arrested, but Li still commanded the bandits to launch a riot on August 28th, vainly attempting to rescue Jiang and occupy Harbin. At about 2:00 a.m. that day, Li led his troops in a riot in Taiping Bridge and Guxiangtun in Harbin. The Harbin military police quickly dispatched forces to suppress the riot, and the bandits were defeated within half an hour, and Li was captured. During his "missionary activities," Li successively defrauded people of wealth totaling 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in various parts of Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall). After arriving in Harbin, he defrauded people of wealth totaling more than 250,000 yuan, raped more than a dozen women, and called himself a "Living Buddha," vainly attempting to ascend the throne and become emperor after the riot succeeded, using this to deceive backward masses and facilitate his espionage activities.

	Cui Dagang was also a puppet Manchukuo police secret agent. In December of last year, he joined the Harbin bandit group Cao Xingwu's department as an adjutant. In May of this year, he was captured by the Democratic Allied Army. The Democratic Allied Army, based on its lenient policy, urged him to repent and reform, and then released him. However, Cui persisted in his evil ways. In late July, he was re-commissioned by Huang Yong'an (i.e., Huang Shiding), lieutenant general and counselor of the Kuomintang Northeast Security Command, to organize the bandit army "Sixth Route Army" in Harbin, with Cui serving as the commander of the Third Army. He recruited more than 1,000 bandits near Harbin, burning, killing, looting, and harassing the people in various places, and attempting to cooperate with Jiang and others' riot plan to attack Harbin. The plan failed, and Cui was captured on August 25th.
