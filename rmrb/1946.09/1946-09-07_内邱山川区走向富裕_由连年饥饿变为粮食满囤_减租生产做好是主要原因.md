[Changzhi News from this Newspaper] The Fourth District of Neiqiu has many mountains and little land. Through organized rent reduction and production efforts, and vigorously promoting sideline occupations in conjunction with agricultural production, all thirty-one villages in the district can now achieve a surplus after meeting their agricultural needs. In the past six months, the district has newly added 446 head of livestock, 3,314 sheep, 1,195 pigs, 3,690 silkworm rearing frames, 106 beehives, 21,455 catties of medicinal herbs dug up, 4,902 catties of spun cotton, and 1,489 bolts of woven cloth. Including income from commercial transportation, charcoal burning, oak bark stripping, and other sideline occupations, the total income has reached over 25 million yuan. Pig raising alone has exceeded 50% of the annual plan. This district has traditionally been known as having "half a year of grain supplemented by bran and wild vegetables." The mountainous land is barren, and on average, each person has only a little over one mu of sloping land. However, a few large landlords occupied more than half of the land. After Zhang Yinwu's extortion and plunder during the War of Resistance and the major flood in 1939, 509 people starved to death in 1940. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the masses reduced rent, cleared debts, and organized large-scale production, proposing the slogan: "Rely on the mountains for what they offer, rely on the water for what it provides" and the policy of combining agriculture and sideline occupations. Through active production in the past two years, the barren mountains and fields have quickly transformed into prosperous rural areas with herds of pigs and sheep and granaries overflowing with grain.

　　内邱山川区走向富裕
    由连年饥饿变为粮食满囤
    减租生产做好是主要原因
    【本报长治讯】内邱四区山多地少，经组织起来减租生产，并极力提倡副业以与农业生产相结合全区三十一个村，今年已可达到耕三余一。半年来，全区新增加牲口四百四十六头，羊三千三百一十四只，猪一千一百九十五口，蚕三千六百九十席，蜂一百○六窝，刨药二万一千四百五十五斤，纺花四千九百○二斤，织布一千四百八十九匹，连上商业运输、烧木炭、剥槲枝皮等副业收入共达二千五百余万元，养猪一项已超过全年计划的百分之五十。该区素有“糠菜半年粮”之称，山地贫瘠，按人口平均每人只有一亩多坡地，但几户大地主就占了一半以上，经过抗战后张荫梧的搜刮勒索和民国二十八年的大水灾，迄二十九年即饿死五百○九人，共产党领导群众减租清债和组织起来大生产，提出：“靠山吃山，傍水吃水”的口号，农副结合的方针，经去前两年积极生产，使荒硗山野很快变成猪羊成群，粮食满囤的富庶农村。
