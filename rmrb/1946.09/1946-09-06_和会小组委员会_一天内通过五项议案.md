    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd] Paris: The peace conference subcommittees passed five clauses of the draft peace treaties at the meeting on August 31. Reuters said, "This is the first record in the history of the peace conference." These include: (1) The Military Committee unanimously passed a ban on former enemy countries from manufacturing atomic weapons, but research on atomic energy for peaceful purposes is not prohibited. (2) The Military Committee passed the clauses in the draft treaty without discussion, that is, Pantelleria and Jiang Laqin Islands (both in the Mediterranean) are completely demilitarized, and the fortification of Sicily and Sardinia is restricted. (3) The Romanian, Bulgarian and Hungarian Committee passed the clause of Romania's 300 million yuan compensation to the Soviet Union. (4) The Italian Political and Territorial Committee passed the Italian territorial claims on the draft treaty with Italy. (5) The Italian Political and Territorial Committee mostly agreed to modify the wording of Article 42 of the Treaty with Italy.
    Sunday, the first of the month, the peace conference rested as usual.
    On the evening of the 2nd, the Italian Economic and Financial Committee met to discuss the issue of Italy's compensation to the Soviet Union with goods, and the meeting rejected the Australian representative's amendment.
