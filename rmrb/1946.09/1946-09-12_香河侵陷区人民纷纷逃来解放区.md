Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 5th. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded villages and towns such as Xiji and Yinjiahe in Xianghe County, the masses, unable to bear the harassment, have been fleeing to the liberated areas of Xianghe, reaching more than two thousand people. Along the way, there are still a large number of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing in an endless stream. It is said that in Yinjiahe alone, more than 100 families had 500 *shi* of grain looted by the Chiang Kai-shek troops; young women in various villages were all raped. The harsh taxes and levies imposed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the area were even more brutal than those of the enemy and puppet regime. Regardless of summer or autumn, one *dou* of wheat and 400 *yuan* of *fabi* (legal tender) and 1,000 bricks were levied per *mu*. In addition, each household with more than 50 *mu* of land was ordered to provide ten large *dan* of grain and purchase a rifle to equip the so-called "Self-Defense Corps" organized by ruffians and traitors.

　　香河侵陷区人民纷纷逃来解放区
    【新华社遵化五日电】蒋军侵陷香河县属西集、尹家河等村镇后，群众不堪其扰，纷纷逃至香河解放区者已达二千余名。沿途尚有大批难胞，扶老携幼，络绎逃亡中。据称：仅尹家河百余家，即被蒋军抢去粮食五百石；各村青年妇女，悉遭奸污。蒋军在该地的苛捐杂税，较敌伪还凶，无论夏秋，每亩一律征小麦一斗，法币四百元，砖一千块。另外勒令各户每满五十亩田产者出粮十大担，购买步枪一支，装备流氓汉奸组织的所谓“自卫团”。
