A Collection of Congratulatory Telegrams

    Sincere Congratulations

    This is the Northwest 38th Army, nurtured by the people of the Northwest, inheriting Sun Yat-sen's doctrines, revolutionary traditions, and upholding General Yang Hucheng's revolutionary zeal. They persisted in the areas of Sanbian and Qingguo to suppress Liu, initiated the "Double Twelve" Incident, and fought valiantly on the front lines of the Anti-Japanese War. Their years of arduous and patient struggle have earned the respect and remembrance of the people of the entire country!

    Now, to oppose the dictatorial traitor's civil war and strive for the independence, democracy, and freedom of the Chinese people, they have joined forces with the sons and daughters of the border region, side by side to defend the people of the border region, which we feel is the greatest honor and joy.

    At this time of the Mid-Autumn Festival, amidst continuous reports of self-defense victories along the Longhai and Tongpu lines, we also heard the great news of the reunion of our Northwest People's Revolutionary Army, and everywhere people are singing and dancing with wild joy.

    We extend our sincere congratulations to Commander Kong Congzhou on his inauguration ceremony, and we are willing to make sincere efforts to ensure the well-being and strength of your army.

    The Government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region respectfully wishes!
    September 13th

    To General Kong Congzhou and all officers and soldiers:

    Chiang Kai-shek is warlike by nature, autocratic and self-serving, relying on American imperialist elements to launch a nationwide civil war, discarding the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference like worn-out shoes, breaking his four promises, and employing countless secret agents, resulting in the unjust deaths of Li and Wen. His evil policies have led to increasing hardship for the people. Now he is planning to use two million troops to attack the people and the liberated areas. The flames of war are spreading everywhere, and the country is on the verge of ruin. The people are not afraid of death, so how can he threaten them with death? Chiang Kai-shek vainly hopes to achieve his goals by oppressing the people, but he will ultimately suffer the consequences of his actions. We are delighted to hear of the establishment of your army and are glad that the ranks of the patriotic and self-defense forces are growing. We send this telegram to congratulate you, hoping that we can work together to ensure the success of the cause of peace and democracy.

    To General Kong Congzhou and all officers and soldiers:

    Chiang Kai-shek, disregarding the suffering of the people, colludes with American reactionaries to launch a nationwide civil war, tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and undermine the cause of peace and democracy. He excludes dissidents and suppresses democratic forces. All patriotic and democratic people across the country are indignant and rise up in opposition. Your army is an armed force of the people of the Northwest, fighting for the cause of peace and democracy for many years. At this time of national crisis, you will undoubtedly contribute greatly to the patriotic self-defense war. We are delighted to hear of the establishment of your army and send this telegram to congratulate you.

　　贺电一束
    诚挚的庆祝
    这是西北人民所抚育的西北三十八军，继承着孙中山主义，革命传统，坚持了杨虎诚将军的革命热忱，三边坚持，清国讨刘，“双十二”兵谏，英勇奋战于抗日最前线，艰苦隐忍的搏斗了这些年，受到全国人民的钦敬与怀念！
    今者为反对独夫卖国内战，争取中国人民的独立、民主、自由，和边区子弟兵结合在一起，并肩保卫边区人民，感到最大的光荣与快慰。
    时值中秋陇海同蒲不断的自卫捷报声中，又听到我西北人民革命军伟大的团聚消息，到处歌舞欢快欲狂了。

    孔从周将军暨全体官兵同志：
    蒋介石好战成性，专制自为，投靠美帝国主义分子，发动全国内战，政协决议，弃如弊屣，四项诺言，食言自肥，特务如毛，李闻蒙冤，恶政所及，民生益困，今竟策动二百万大军，进攻人民，进攻解放区，烽烟遍地，国将不国，民不畏死，奈何以死惧之！蒋介石妄冀残民以逞，但终必自食其果。欣闻贵军成立，咸庆爱国自卫之阵营益大，特驰电贺，希共戮力，裨和平民主事业克底于成。

    蒋介石不顾人民疾苦，勾结美国反动派，发动全国内战，撕毁政协决议，破坏和平民主事业，排斥异己摧残民主势力，全国爱国民主人士，莫不同声愤慨，群起反对，贵军乃西北人民武装，为和平民主事业奋斗多年，值此国事日非之秋，供献于爱国自卫战争之处必多，欣闻贵军成立特伸电贺。
