　　Taiyue Women's Constituency Councilor
    Liu Yupu Donates Over 300 Mu of Land
    Shimin Masses Donate Funds to Relieve Fellow Countrymen in the Jilu-Yu River Area
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 7th] Taiyue Women's Constituency Councilor Mr. Liu Yupu recently donated all of his 330 mu of land to farmers who have no land. Mr. Liu Yupu is from Shangzhai Village, Hongdong. His land is mostly located in Yangzhai Village, Fushan. After the war, he immediately led his children in participating in the resistance against Japan. In 1942, he voluntarily approached the village farmers' association and village government to request the return of the rent. In 1943, he only collected just over six shi of rent from over 300 mu of land. In 1944, he again allowed Taiyue Middle School to cultivate half of his land without rent. Recently, he personally visited the tenants in Fushan, expressing his willingness to donate all of his land to landless farmers. He said, "We are running around all day to serve the people. Donating land to landless farmers is a concrete way to seek the interests of the people."
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 5th] The Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war and halting the Yellow River dike restoration have left millions of people in the former river course facing the disaster of renewed flooding. The masses in the second district of Shimin, in view of this, have launched a fervent fundraising campaign. They said, "During the great famine the year before last, if it weren't for the government collecting a large amount of bran and rice from Yuebei to relieve us, we wouldn't have escaped the famine. Now, we can't forget the pain of the disaster." Some said, "The Kuomintang reactionaries are constantly trying to poison us, trying to drown our fellow countrymen in Jilu-Yu. We must donate large sums of money to provide relief and strengthen our self-defense forces." The enthusiasm for donations throughout the district is extremely high. Nanping Village alone donated 25,000 yuan. Shui'an, Zhangshan, Yelu and other villages donated over 10,000 yuan each. In total, 15 administrative villages donated a total of 145,745 yuan.

　　太岳妇女界参议员
    刘玉璞献田三百余亩
    士敏群众捐款救济冀鲁豫河道同胞
    【本报阳城七日电】太岳妇女界参议员刘玉璞先生，顷将其全部土地三百三十亩，献给没有土地的农民。刘玉璞先生系洪洞上寨村人，其土地多在浮山阳寨村。战后即带领子女参加抗日。三十一年曾自动找村农会及村公所要求退租。三十二年三百余亩地仅收租六石余。三十三年又将其土地一半无租让给太岳中学耕种，最近特亲赴浮山拜访各佃户，愿将其全部土地献给无地农民，她说：“咱们整日奔走是为人民服务，将土地献给无地的农民，即是具体为人民谋利益”。
    【本报阳城五日电】国民党扩大内战停止黄河复堤，故道数百万人民面临复顶之灾，士敏二区群众有鉴于此，展开热烈的募捐运动。他们说：“大前年闹灾荒，要不是政府从岳北募集大批糠米来救济咱，咱也逃不过荒年。现在咱可不能忘了灾难的痛苦。”有的说：“国民党反动派时时想毒害咱们，想淹死咱冀鲁豫同胞，咱们要大量捐款救济，加强咱们的自卫力量。”全区捐助热情极高，南坪一个村就捐了二万五千元，水安、张山、野鹿等村，捐资都在万元以上。总计十五个行政村，共捐资十四万五千七百四十五元。
