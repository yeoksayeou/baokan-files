　　Border Region Government Organs Send Letter to Liu and Deng
    Warmly Console Frontline Soldiers
    Cadres Donate Subsidies and Daily Necessities
    Guarantee Army Supply
    Stipulate Economy Measures
    [Our newspaper, Handan, 6th] The Border Region Government and its directly affiliated organs, responding to Vice Chairman Rong's call to support the army, launched a donation campaign. All comrades actively donated their subsidies, living allowances, and saved daily necessities to the frontline self-defense soldiers. As of August 27th, the Border Region Government headquarters had donated more than 6,000 yuan, the General Post Office and Postal School more than 30,000 yuan, the Peace Hospital more than 6,000 yuan, convalescents in the hospital more than 1,000 yuan, and the Yongsheng Chemical Industry Cooperative donated a box of soap (200 bars). In addition, various units donated towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, etc., totaling about 56,000 yuan in foreign currency. A letter was also sent to Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng, forwarding it to the frontline commanders and fighters, stating: You are bravely fighting against the reactionary army of the traitor and nation-selling Chiang Kai-shek on the front lines to protect the interests of the people of the entire border region and to strive for the independence, peace, and democracy of the country and nation. You have annihilated more than 20,000 of Chiang's and Yan's troops, liberated many towns such as Lanfeng and Hongdong, and controlled more than 470 li of the Longhai and Tongpu railways, greatly hitting the frenzied civil war flames of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, and exciting the people of the entire border region. The Border Region Government and all staff of directly affiliated organs, in addition to intensifying rear service work with a high degree of enthusiasm and striving to economize to ensure frontline supply, respectfully contribute a portion of our subsidies and living allowances to you to express our condolences and sincere love.
    [Our newspaper, Handan, 6th] In order to fully support the front lines and guarantee the supply of the troops, the Border Region Government has specially decided to implement the following austerity measures. (1) Political and civilian workers will reduce their daily grain consumption by two liang. (2) The 30 yuan subsidy for cadres will be suspended (miscellaneous personnel will still receive it as usual). (3) The second half-year office miscellaneous expenses of various organs will not be issued and will be self-sufficient through production by each organ. (4) In principle, clothes and quilts will not be issued, but individual comrades who truly have no clothes or quilts, or whose clothes are so torn that they cannot be used, will be supplemented individually. This must be done after democratic deliberation and initial approval, and it is stipulated that the maximum supplement for clothing should not exceed one-half, and the supplement for quilts should not exceed one-fifth. (5) Personnel will be streamlined and verified again to investigate concealed positions and squeeze out a portion of the overspending quota. (6) Emphasis will be placed on opposing corruption, waste, and decay. At present, various units within the Border Region Government are studying and implementing measures based on this decision, adjusting various expenses such as office miscellaneous expenses. Mobilization has been carried out among all workers and miscellaneous personnel regarding the supplementation of clothing and quilts, and a review committee has been opened, which decided to supplement them separately according to the principle of overall adjustment of bedding. New materials are used for the surface and old materials are used for the lining and cotton of old cotton clothes. If it is still insufficient, the organs will supplement it. In addition, in conjunction with the study of current affairs and the study of the July 7th Declaration, it was decided to launch an ideological examination starting in September to overcome the existing peace concepts and slackening fighting spirit of some comrades, and the resulting phenomena of corruption, waste, and decay. This examination movement will be turned into a competition for work, study, and production.
