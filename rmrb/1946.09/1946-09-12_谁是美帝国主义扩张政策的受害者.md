　　Who Are the Victims of U.S. Imperialist Expansionism?
　　Huang Caoliang

　　Post-war U.S. imperialism's increasingly obvious "expansion policy" is being carried out under the banner of anti-Soviet and anti-communist. From the United Nations Security Council and the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference to the currently ongoing peace conference, and from European, Near Eastern to Far Eastern issues, the U.S. authorities have adopted a series of aggressive postures towards the Soviet Union, loudly advocating the so-called "tough policy towards the Soviet Union." Shortly after the first Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes publicly announced a "peace offensive against the Soviet Union." At the recent Paris Peace Conference, according to a United Press dispatch dated August 21, the United States is launching a "meticulously planned anti-Soviet diplomatic offensive." Many reactionary American newspapers clamor for "opposing Soviet control of Europe," "opposing Soviet control of China," and "strictly preventing international communism from cooperating internally and externally."

　　No matter how carefully the anti-Soviet smokescreen is spread, if we lift this smokescreen and look at the current facts, it is not difficult to see who is actively pursuing an expansion policy around the world and who is the direct victim of this policy.

　　Militarily, U.S. imperialism is stepping up the implementation of a huge "world base network" plan. According to the vast plan for U.S. overseas bases published by the United Press on July 2, it is stipulated that the United States should possess more than 40 overseas bases after the war, spread across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and running across the Equator, both north and south. Among them, those belonging to Britain and Australia include nine locations such as Jamaica, Antigua, and St. Lucia in the West Indies, Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, and Guyana and Kalida. One belongs to France, and one to Denmark. The construction projects of bases in Greenland and Iceland are under design. Now, U.S. imperialist elements are also attempting to turn the entire China into their military base and seize important ports such as Qingdao. These bases can all use "anti-Soviet" as an excuse, but these bases are not built on Soviet territory, but on the territory, dependencies, or spheres of influence of countries such as Britain, France, Australia, Iceland, Denmark, and China.

　　Economically, U.S. imperialism is using its monetary power to relentlessly seize and monopolize the world market, which also damages the economic interests of countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Middle East. The U.S. is shouting about "open door," "equal opportunity," and "free trade" everywhere, which is primarily aimed at Britain's imperial preference. The Anglo-American loan of $3.75 billion signed at the end of last year forced Britain to accept the harsh conditions of participating in the formulation of an international trade charter to abolish imperial preferences and freely using dollars within the sterling area. Once this condition is implemented, cheap American goods and dollars will pour into Britain's sphere of influence, excluding British goods and capital everywhere, and placing the British economy, which "must export or die," in an even more unmanageable situation. This method of market competition by the U.S. authorities is carried out under the guise of "helping" other countries. Some British newspapers are already shouting "We need to act quickly and not rely on American help!" Not only that, U.S. imperialist elements not only want to compete for the British market, but even attempt to make Britain its economic appendage. In 1931, the Newfoundland government went bankrupt. At that time, the British government took this opportunity to force Newfoundland to abandon its dominion status as a condition for repaying Newfoundland's debts. From 1933, Newfoundland was reduced from a dominion to a colony. Now, the mouthpiece of the U.S. imperialist group, "Human Events," openly advocates that "the principle that Britain applied to Newfoundland should be applied by us to Britain."

　　In the countries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean, American economic power is encroaching step by step. Recently, the United States has plundered oil rights in countries such as Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, and Italy. In Palestine, the United States is attempting to implement its plan to move 100,000 Jews into the country in order to expand its influence. At the same time, the United States has also signed aviation agreements with Italy and Egypt that infringe on the sovereignty of these two countries. The expansion of American power in these regions directly threatens Britain's sphere of influence and also damages the interests of national independence of the countries in these regions.

　　In addition, not long ago, the United States used loans as a means to allow countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark to implement "tariff reductions" and "free trade." Subsequently, these countries will experience a flood of American goods, oppressing the industries of these countries.

　　Therefore, the economic expansion policy of U.S. imperialism overseas cannot directly harm the socialist country of the Soviet Union, which is independent and self-reliant and does not rely on foreign markets, but can only directly harm the capitalist world outside the United States.

　　The effort to compete for military bases and markets is inseparable from the attempt to colonize other countries. For example, for South and Central America, the U.S. authorities recently proposed a "broad military cooperation plan with Pan-American countries," stipulating that the armies of each country should be armed and trained to suit Americanized standards. U.S. commentator Steel pointed out incisively at the end of August when commenting on this plan: "The U.S. president, while enjoying the power to supply weapons and arbitrarily withdraw weapons, will become the sole judge of the fate of the governments of Central and South American countries, supporting dictators and overthrowing regimes he does not like." The Peruvian "Labor News" has warned: "Accepting this plan means subordinating Latin American countries to the U.S. military, thereby killing their sovereignty." Especially for China, the U.S. authorities are actively implementing armed intervention, attempting to turn China into their colony. The demands of U.S. imperialist elements on China are: "You must follow the example of the Philippines!" The U.S. authorities are doing their best to support the Chiang Kai-shek comprador warlord government, which is willing to accept this demand, to carry out massacres against the Chinese people who resolutely reject this demand. With the cooperation of the Chiang government, U.S. imperialist forces have freely invaded our country's territory, territorial waters, territorial airspace, and inland rivers, controlled the Kuomintang government's military, financial, economic, internal affairs, and diplomacy, and arbitrarily violated China's sovereignty. At the same time, the signing of the humiliating company law and the flood of American goods entering and dumping have created the greatest crisis in the history of China's national industry. Industrial and commercial enterprises are closing down one after another, national capital is going bankrupt one after another, and workers are losing their jobs in batches. Therefore, China is currently one of the most tragic victims of the "expansion policy" of U.S. imperialist elements.

　　At the same time, the expansion policy of U.S. imperialism also harms the interests of the broad masses of the American people. Because the "expansion policy" requires huge expenditures, it promotes the imbalance of revenue and expenditure and inflation, increasing the burden on the people. Due to the large-scale dumping of goods overseas and the large-scale funding of reactionary factions in various countries (such as Chiang Kai-shek, etc.), the American people are suffering from the shortage of daily necessities and high prices. The unstable world situation caused by the "expansion policy" prevents many peaceful industrialists from developing overseas trade. The continued non-withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed overseas prevents many officers and soldiers from returning home to reunite with their families and enjoy a peaceful and happy life.

　　In summary, although the expansion policy of U.S. imperialism is labeled as anti-Soviet and anti-communist, the direct victims of this policy are first the capitalist world outside the United States and the American people, and not the Soviet Union and its neighboring new democratic countries (such as Poland, Czech Republic, etc.). This situation cannot but remind people that when Hitler was carrying out his plan to "conquer Europe" and "conquer the world," the first to be attacked and swallowed by him were Britain, France, and the other thirteen countries in Europe. This is a similar aspect. The difference is that Germany and the Soviet Union are both on the European continent, while the United States and the Soviet Union are far apart across the ocean; before the war, some people were anesthetized by the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of "appeasement" towards fascism, but after Hitler was defeated, the people of the world became more aware, the people's strength became stronger, and the world peace fortress, the Soviet Union, became stronger. It is even clearer that if U.S. imperialist elements want to learn from Hitler's example, they will encounter insurmountable difficulties and inevitable failure. First of all, in order to implement its expansion policy, U.S. imperialist elements must try to implement fascism at home, but the American people are opposed to fascism and love peace and democracy. Within the American bourgeoisie, there is also a part that advocates restoring Roosevelt's policy of compromise with the domestic and labor circles and non-cooperation with foreign countries, which has become a serious internal obstacle to the expansion policy of U.S. imperialism. Internationally, the "anti-Soviet" propaganda of U.S. imperialist elements is essentially a plan to promote "world hegemony." In order to deal with the Soviet Union, there is a "reason" to establish military bases in Europe and Asia, and there is a "reason" to gradually turn the countries in these places into "Philippines Number One," mobilizing the manpower and material resources of these countries to become the victims of the adventurous policies of American imperialism. However, the people of various countries in Europe and Asia, as well as a part of the bourgeoisie, do not want to be such victims, and will inevitably unite to oppose the expansion policy of U.S. imperialism. The authoritative British magazine "The Economist" expressed its heartfelt resentment towards the Anglo-American loan: "The poor have no chance to choose, but they can still traditionally curse the rich!" The spokesperson of the British government revealed the sound of revenge of "wait and see in five years." Britain will increasingly see clearly that what is harming them and oppressing them is the peaceful construction and the Soviet Union, which has always treated people equally, or the American boss who lends money at high interest rates, competes for markets and military bases! In the Middle East, Britain is carrying out a struggle to resist American power. The national movements in the Middle East countries are also gradually unfolding. In the Far East, the Chinese people unanimously oppose the U.S. authorities' aid to Chiang's civil war and demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops in China. In Iceland, public opinion openly criticizes the United States' attempt to establish a base in the country and demands the withdrawal of U.S. troops. In the countries of Central and South America, the upsurge against the "Pan-American Cooperation Plan" is also rising. The movement against the expansion of the U.S. authorities is becoming increasingly popular around the world, which is an important feature of the current world situation.

　　The "expansion policy" of U.S. imperialist elements is creating new enemies for themselves every day, and their dream of "the 20th century being the century of American rule" is impossible to realize. Because the 20th century belongs to the people, "it is the century of the people!"

　　谁是美帝国主义扩张政策的受害者
    黄操良
    战后美帝国主义日益明显的“扩张政策”，是在反苏反共的旗帜下进行的。从联合国安全理事会、巴黎外长会议到目前召开中的和会，从欧洲、近东到远东问题，美国当局对苏联曾采取了一系列的攻击姿态，高唱所谓“对苏强硬政策”。在第一次巴黎外长会议后不久，美国务卿贝纳斯曾公开宣布“对苏进行和平攻势”。在最近的巴黎和会上，据美联社八月二十一日电称：美国正发动了“计划缜密的反苏外交攻势”。美国不少反动报纸叫嚣着“反对苏联控制欧洲”，“反对苏联控制中国”，“严防国际共产主义里应外合”。
    不管反苏的烟幕散布得如何周到，但如果揭开这一烟幕来看一看目前的事实，就不难看出谁是在世界各地积极推行扩张政策，谁是这个政策的直接受害者。
    在军事上，美帝国主义正加紧推行着一庞大的“世界基地纲”计划，据联合社载七月二日公布的美海外基地的庞大计划，规定美战后得拥有海外基地四十余处、遍布大西、太平两洋，并横贯赤道南北。其中属于英澳的，计有西印度群岛中的牙买加、安蒂瓜与圣罗西亚，巴哈马群岛中的大爱克舒马岛，以及圭亚那与卡里达等九处。属于法国的一处，丹麦的一处。格陵兰、冰岛建筑基地工程，正在设计中。现在美帝国主义分子还企图把整个中国变为他们的军事基地，并霸占青岛等重要港口。这些基地都可以拿“反苏”为借口，但是这些基地并不筑在苏联的领土上，而是筑在英、法、澳、冰岛、丹麦、中国等国的领土、属地或势力范围内。
    在经济上，美帝国主义正利用金元势力对世界市场作无底止的侵占与垄断，这同样使英、法、意、丹、比、荷及中东等国的经济权益蒙受损害。美方正到处叫喊“门户开放”，“机会均等”与“自由贸易”，这首先针对着英国的帝国优先权。去年底签订的三十七亿五千万美元的英美贷款，强使英国接受了参加制订取消帝国优先权的国际贸易宪章，并在金镑区内自由使用金元的苛刻条件，这个条件一旦实行，美国的廉价商品与金元，势将滚滚流入英国势力圈内，到处排斥英国商品与资本，使“不输出即死出”的英国经济陷于益发不可收拾之境。美当局这种争夺市场的手段，是在“帮助”他国的名义下进行的，英国有些报纸已经在叫喊“我们需要迅速动作，而不要依赖美国帮助”！不仅如此，美帝国主义分子不仅要争夺英国的市场，甚至企图要英国成为它经济上的附庸。在一九三一年，纽芬兰政府陷于破产，当时英政府曾趁这个机会，迫纽芬兰放弃自治领，作为替纽芬兰偿付债款的条件。从一九三三年起，纽芬兰即从自治领降为殖民地地位了。现在美帝国主义集团的喉古“人类事件”，竟公开主张“英国所应用于纽芬兰的原则，应由我们应用于英国”。
    在中东及地中海一带的国家，美国的经济势力正一步紧一步地侵入。最近美国在外约旦、沙特阿拉伯、巴林岛、伊朗、黎巴嫩、埃及、意大利等国，掠得了石油权益。在巴勒斯坦，美国正企图实施其十万犹太人移入巴境之计划，以扩展其势力。同时，美国又与意、埃签订了侵犯该两国主权的航空协定。美国势力在这些地区的扩张，直接威胁着英国的势力范围，也伤害了这些区域内各国的民族独立的利益。
    此外，不久以前，美国又借贷款为手段，通使法、比、荷、丹等国实行“减低关税”及“自由贸易”等。随之而来，这些国家将发生美货泛滥，压迫这些国家的工业的现象。
    因此美帝国主义在海外的经济上的扩张政策，并不能直接损害自主更生、不依靠国外市场的社会主义国家苏联，而只能直接损害美国以外的资本主义世界。
    争夺军事基地，争夺市场的努力，是和其他国家殖民地化的企图分不开的。例如对南、中美洲，最近美当局已提出了“与泛美各国广泛军事合作计划”，规定武装与训练各该国军队，以适合于美国化的标准。美国评论员史梯尔八月底在评这一计划时，一针见血的指出：“美总统在享受供给武器及可以任意收回武器权力之下，将变成中、南美各国政府命运的唯一裁判人，支持独裁者和推翻他不喜欢的政权。”秘鲁“劳工报”已发出警告说：“接受此一计划，即蒋使拉丁美洲各国从属于美国军队，因而杀死它们的主权。”尤其是对于中国，美国当局正积极实行武装干涉，企图把中国变成它们的殖民地。美帝国主义分子对中国的要求就是：“你们要向菲律宾看齐呀！”美国当局尽力扶助愿意接受这一要求的蒋介石买办军阀政府，来向坚决拒绝这种要求的中国人民进行大屠杀。在蒋政府合作之下，目前美帝国主义势力已自由侵入我国的领土、领海、领空和内河，控制了国民党政府的军事、财政、经济、内政和外交，任意侵犯中国的主权。同时，丧权辱国的公司法的签订，和美国商品潮水般的涌入和倾销，造成了中国民族工业有史以来的大危机。工商业纷纷倒闭，民族资本接踵破产，工人一批接一批失业，因此中国乃是目前美帝国主义分子“扩张政策”之最惨重的一个受害者。
    同时，美帝国主义的扩张政策，也危害了美国内广大阶层人民的利益。由于“扩张政策”需要巨额经费，就促进了收支的不平衡和通货膨胀，加重了人民的负担。由于在海外大量倾销货物，并大量资助各国反动派（如蒋介石等），美国人民反感日用品不足及价格高涨之苦。“扩张政策”所酿成的世界不安定局面，使许多和平产业家不能发展海外贸易。美国在海外驻军的继续不撤退，使许多官兵不能回国与家人团圆，享受和平幸福生活。
    综上以观，美帝国主义的扩张政策虽以反苏反共为标榜，但这个政策的直接蒙难者，首先就是美国以外的资本主义世界和美国人民，而还不是苏联与其邻邦的新民主主义国家（如波兰、捷克等）。这种情况，不能不令人回忆到希特勒在进行“征服欧洲”，“征服世界”的计划时，首先遭受到他的打击和吞噬的是英国、法国和欧洲其他其十三个国家，这是类似的一方面。所不同的，德国和苏联同在欧洲大陆上，而美苏间则远隔重洋；在战前，一部分人民曾受英首相张伯伦等对法西斯“绥靖”的政策的麻醉，但在希特勒被打倒后，世界各国人民更觉悟了，人民力量更强大了，世界和平堡垒苏联也更强大了。美帝国主义分子如欲学习希特勒的榜样，将遇到不可克服的困难和必败的命运，也就更明显了。首先，美帝国主义分子要贯彻其扩张政策，必须设法在国内实行法西斯，但美国人民是反对法西斯、爱好和平民主的。美国资产阶级内，亦有一部分主张恢复罗斯福的对内与劳工界妥协、对外国不合作的政策，这就成为美帝国主义扩张政策的内部严重障碍。在国际上，美帝国主义分子的“反苏”宣传，实质上就是推行“世界霸权”的计划。为了对付苏联，就有“理由”在欧洲、亚洲建立军事基地，就有“理由”逐步地把这些地方的国家变为“菲律滨第一”，动员这些国家的人力物力以为美国帝国主义冒险政策的牺牲品。然而，欧亚等洲各国人民以及一部分资产阶级，谁也不愿意当这样的牺牲品，因而必然会联合起来反对美帝国主义的扩张政策。英国资产阶级的权威杂志《经济学者》对美英贷款发出了内心的怨愤：“穷人没有选择的机会，但是他们照旧传统可以咒骂有钱人呀！”英国政府的代言人吐露了“等五年再看”的报复声。英国将日益看清楚危害他们和压迫他们的，究竟是和平建设、素以平等待人的苏联，还是到处放高利贷、争夺市场和军事基地的美国老板！在中东，英国正进行着抗拒美国势力的挣扎斗争。中东各国的民族运动，亦在逐渐展开。在远东，中国人民一致反对美当局援蒋内战，要求撤退在华美军。在冰岛，全国舆论公然抨击美国在该国建立基地的企图，并要求撤退美军。在中、南美各国，反对“泛美合作计划”的热潮，亦正日益高涨。反对美国当局扩张的运动，日益普及全球，这是今天世界形势的一个重要特点。
    美帝国主义分子的“扩张政策”，天天为自己制造新的敌人，他们所梦想的“二十世纪是美国统治的世纪”，是无法实现的。因为二十世纪是属于人民的，“是人民的世纪”！
