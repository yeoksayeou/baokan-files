　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 2nd: New York News: Afternoon Paper reporter Badover wrote on the 1st, pointing out that the United States' support for the dictatorial regime in China has already caused a civil war. The United States' actions in China are similar to the British actions in Greece, and the results are the same. He appealed for the redefinition of American foreign policy in the direction of improving international cooperation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 2nd: London News: British Labour Party member of Parliament Richard Crossman wrote a long article in the New Illustrated, criticizing the US policy towards China, saying: "The United States is using aircraft to arm Chiang Kai-shek's army to attack the Communist army, and the result is civil war, which is completely a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 31st: US News Service, August 29th: American well-known commentator Pelley wrote in the Miami Herald: "Why should we still be inextricably linked with the Chiang Kai-shek government? Who decided that we should stay there to assist Chiang Kai-shek? What good is it for us? Has our mediation prevented the Chinese civil war?" Pelley gave negative answers to these questions. He said: "The Chinese civil war has been going on for a long time, and if we withdraw tomorrow, it is not too early." Pelley outlined the statement of Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, saying: "Madame Sun Yat-sen is a first-class radical in the world and a true humanitarian. She believes that the Chinese central government hopes to provoke a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. I think her opinion is very correct. Indeed, some selfish people hope for a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. No wonder Madame Sun Yat-sen demanded that the US troops withdraw from China."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 2nd: Washington News: Senator Pell, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared on August 13th that the situation in China is about to threaten world peace, "Only the United Nations can resolve it." The problems that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot solve should be resolved by the United Nations, and the United Nations also has the responsibility to intervene. Pell said: "The United States' interference in China's internal affairs" is another painful lesson for the great powers.

　　下午报访员评美助蒋内战
    类似英在希腊行动
    泼贝尔论中国形势
    主张请联合国解决
    【新华社延安二日电】纽约讯：下午报访员巴多佛于一日著文指出美国在中国支持独裁政权，已经引起了内战，美国在中国的行动，类似英国在希腊的行动，并且其所造成的结果也是一样的。他吁请朝着改善国际合作的方向，重定美国的外交政策。
    【新华社延安二日电】伦敦讯：英工党议员李查德克洛斯曼在新画报上著长文抨击美国对华政策称：“美国以飞机武装蒋介石的军队来进攻共产党的军队，其结果便是内战，这完全是西班牙内战的重演。”
    【新华社延安三十一日电】美新闻处二十九日讯：美国著名评论家贝尔在迈安密前锋报著文称：“为什么我们还要和蒋介石政府结不解之缘呢？谁决定我们应留在那儿协助蒋介石呢？我们到底有什么好处呢？我们的折冲周旋是否已防止中国内战呢？”贝氏对这些问题都给予否定的答复。他说：“中国内战已进行很久了，假如我们明天就退出来，实在也不算太早。”贝氏概述孙夫人宋庆龄的声明称：“孙夫人是世界上第一流的急进家，且是一位真正的人道主义者，她认为中国中央政府是希望能够激起美苏间的战争，我认为她的意见是很对的，确实有些自私自利的人希望美苏战争，无怪乎孙夫人要求美军自中国撤退。”
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：参院外交委员会民主党议员泼贝尔氏于八月十三日宣称中国之形势行将威胁世界和平，“仅有联合国始能解决之”。国共双方所不能解决之问题，请联合国解决，联合国亦有过问之职责。泼氏称：“美国干涉中国内政”一语，实为列强之又一惨痛教训。
