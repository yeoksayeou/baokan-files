    The masses in Pang Village, Fifth District of Handan City, enthusiastically launched a campaign to support the army. Everyone competed to donate their property, totaling more than 20,000 yuan worth of materials in one day. The Women's Federation also made sixty-eight pairs of military shoes from the cloth obtained from the fruits of the village's struggle and sent them to the front lines. They said, "The Eighth Route Army is winning battles in the front, protecting the people of Handan so they can live in peace. We should also express our gratitude to the Eighth Route Army by making some military shoes for them to wear." (Zhou Kai)
    The Literary and Art Work Team of the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Military and Political University performed the large-scale Yangko opera "Zhou Zishan" during the Mid-Autumn Festival, achieving great success. All the cadres and students in the school considered it "the best political lesson." Note: The script of "Zhou Zishan" won a special literary and art award in Yan'an. It not only exposed the darkness of the ruling class and praised the hardship and heroism of the people during the Red Army era and the Anti-Japanese War, but also educated people through typical characters like Zhou Zishan, about how individualism, disobedience to the organization, and "me-first" thinking could lead them into the mire of being a disgraced spy. On the other hand, it showed how comrades like Ma Hongzhi and Tian Shengui, who sacrificed everything for the revolution, became leaders of the masses and heroes of the people.

    邯郸市五区庞村群众热烈的展开了劳军运动，每个人都争先恐后的捐献自己的财物，计一天内即收到价值两万多元的物资。妇救会还将村中斗争果实的布匹做成军鞋六八双，送往前线。她们说：“前方八路军打胜仗，保住咱邯郸老百姓过太平日子，咱也总要向八路军表表心，做些军鞋，让他们穿上。”（周凯）
    晋冀鲁豫军政大学文艺工作队在中秋节演出《周子山》巨型秧歌剧，颇为成功，全校不论干部与学员都认为是“上了一课最好的政治课”。按：《周子山》剧本在延安曾得到特等文艺奖金，它不仅揭露了统治阶级的黑暗，歌颂了红军时代及抗日战争中人民的艰苦和英勇，而且通过剧中人如周子山那样的典型，教育着人们个人英雄主义，不服从组织的“唯我”思想，如何陷其于身败名裂的特务泥坑中。而一切为革命牺牲的马红志、田生贵等同志，又如何成了群众的领袖，人民的英雄。
