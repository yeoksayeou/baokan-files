　　America's Three Major Progressive Groups
　　The American Congress for Peace, the National Citizens Political Action Committee, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations are currently the three major democratic and progressive groups in the United States.
　　The Congress for Peace was established in April of this year as a progressive group to mobilize the American people to uphold international cooperation, oppose the anti-Soviet tendencies and imperialist foreign policies within the United States, and strive for lasting world peace. The congress held its founding meeting in Washington from April 5th to 7th this year. Participants included the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council, the National Lawyers Guild, the American-Soviet Friendship Society, the American Slav Congress, the American Association of Scientific Workers, the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Committee, the Pacific Association, and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. Prominent figures attending the meeting included former Secretary of the Interior Ickes, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Davies, former Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, the late President Roosevelt's son Roosevelt, and progressive congressmen Sabath, Pepper, Douglas, Kilgore, etc. The congress elected the famous naval captain Carlson, who came to China during the early stages of the war to investigate our anti-Japanese bases behind enemy lines, and the famous black singer Robeson as chairmen of the National Organizing Committee. Members of the committee include Kligge, chairman of the American Slav Congress, Kirtley, chairman of the American Association of Scientific Workers, Bridges, chairman of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Nixon, representative of the Washington Electrical Workers Union, and Thomas, vice chairman of the United Automobile Workers. The congress resolved to strive for the implementation of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference agreement on the China issue, strengthen Soviet-American unity, implement the Potsdam Agreement, sever relations with Franco, and oppose the reactionary forces of big capital, among other things.
　　The Political Action Committee is a political organization of workers affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, with over five million members (plus family members, more than fifteen million). It played a tremendous role in the 1944 general election. Those who witnessed the workers re-electing Roosevelt and defeating reactionary congressmen in the election praised the arrival of the American "People's Century," which shows the great power of the committee.
　　To ensure that progressive congressmen and governors win in this year's congressional and gubernatorial elections, the committee, along with the National Political Action Committee and the National Citizens Committee for the Arts, Sciences and Professions, held a joint meeting in New York in mid-May, deciding to establish a joint committee to coordinate the election campaign and defeat reactionary congressmen and governors.
　　The committee was established because only 28 million eligible voters voted in the 1942 general election, allowing some reactionaries to take advantage of the opportunity to come to power. Therefore, the leaders of the Congress of Industrial Organizations proposed studying the results of the 1942 general election, proposing a plan to stop the reactionary tide, and drafting implementation methods. A special meeting was held in Washington on July 7, 1944, and the Political Action Committee was established, with the following people assigned to be responsible: Hillman (deceased) as chairman, Bittner as vice chairman, and Thomas as secretary.
　　The establishment of the Political Action Committee immediately attracted the attention of American progressives, who eagerly participated, including many business, religious, and consumer groups. Their activities have the same goals as the Political Action Committee, and because there is a need to unite to elect progressive presidents and congressmen, the National Citizens Political Action Committee, a non-partisan organization not affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, was established in August 1944 to unite all progressive people and groups outside the Congress of Industrial Organizations to jointly conduct the campaign to elect progressive presidents and congressmen.
　　Participants in the committee, in addition to the National Farmers Union and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, include many famous leaders from all walks of life in the United States, such as Benson (former Governor of Minnesota), Whitney, chairman of the Railroad Trainmen, Anderson, former director of the Women's Bureau of the Labor Department, Bliven, editor of the New Republic, Bremer, a banker, Coolidge, a professor at Harvard University, Mrs. McAllister, former head of the Women's Division of the National Democratic Party, and writers, businessmen, lawyers, movie stars, singers, musicians, judges, etc. The chairman of the committee was originally Hillman, now Benson, the vice chairman is Patton (chairman of the National Farmers Union), the supervisor is McGill of the McGill Manufacturing Company in Indiana, and the secretary is Foreman (chairman of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare).
　　Although the above two political action committees were initially established to cope with the 1944 general election, they continued to exist as permanent organizations after the election, fighting for the unity of the three powers, world peace, and progressive democracy.

　　美国三大进步团体
    美国争取和平大会、全国公民政治行动委员会、产业工会联合会，是目前美国三大民主进步团体。
    争取和平大会成立于今年四月，是动员美国人民坚持国际合作、反对美国国内反苏倾向及帝国主义的外交政策、争取世界持久和平的进步团体。该大会于今年四月五日至七日在华盛顿举行成立大会，参加者有全国公民政治行动委员会，产业工会联合会，艺术科学自由独立公民委员会，全国律师公会，美苏友谊协会，美国斯拉夫大会，美国科学工作者协会，远东民主政策委员会，太平洋协会，南方人类福利委员会等进步团体。与会著名人士，有美国前内长伊克斯，前驻苏大使戴维斯，前财长摩根索，故罗斯福总统之子罗斯福，进步议员萨巴斯、泼贝尔、德拉斯、基尔戈莱等。大会选出曾于抗战初期来华考察我敌后抗日根据地的著名海军上校卡尔逊及著名黑人歌王罗伯逊为全国组织委员会的主席。委员中有美国斯拉夫大会主席克里兹基，美国科学工作者协会主席基特勒，产业工会联合会所属码头工人工会主席布立治，华盛顿电力工人工会代表尼克松，汽车工人工会副主席汤姆斯等。大大会决议奋斗目标为实行莫斯科三外长会议关于中国问题的协定，加强美苏团结，实行波茨顿协定，对佛朗哥绝交，反对大资本反动势力等项。
    政治行动委员会，是附属于产业工会联合会的工人政治性组织，现会员五百余万人（加上家属则一千五百万人以上），在一九四四年的大选中起了极巨大的作用，目击大选中工人重选罗斯福及打败反动议员的情形者，曾赞叹美国“人民世纪”已经到来，由此可见该会力量之巨大。
    为了使今年国会及州长选举中进步议员及州长获胜，该会与全国政治行动委员会、全国公民艺术就业委员会于五月中旬在纽约举行联席会议，决定成立了联合委员会，共同配合选举运动，以便击败反动议员与州长。
    该会成立原因，系鉴于一九四二年大选中有资格选民中仅有二千八百万人投票，致使一部分反动分子得以乘机上台。因此产业工会联合会领袖遂提议研究一九四二年大选结果，提议阻止反动浪潮之计划，并拟出实行方法，于一九四四年七月七日在华府开特别会议，由该会成立政治行动委员会，并指定下列各人负责：希尔曼（已故）任主席，比特纳任副主席及汤姆斯任秘书。
    政治行动委员会成立后，立即引起美国进步人士之注意，并热望参加，而且其中有许多企业、宗教及消费者团体。他们的活动目的与政治行动委员会相同，因有团结起来选举进步总统与议员的此类之必要，乃于一九四四年八月成立一无党派的不属于产业工会联合会的全国公民政治行动委员会，以便团结产业工会联合会以外的一切进步人士与团体，共同进行选举进步总统与议员的运动。
    参加该会者，除全国农民联盟、南方人类福利委员会外，并有许多美国各界著名的领袖人物，如宾生（前明尼苏达州长）、铁道工人联谊会主席惠特尼、前劳工部妇女主任安德逊、新共和主编布利凡、银行家布列梅、哈佛大学教授柯立芝、全国民主党前妇女部部长麦克阿丽斯特夫人及作家、商人、律师、电影明星、歌唱家、音乐家、法官等。该会主席原为希尔曼充任，现为宾生，副主席为巴顿（全国农民联盟主席），监理员为印度安那州麦克基尔制造公司之麦克基尔，秘书为福尔曼（南方人类福利委员会主席）。
    以上两政治行动委员会，于成立之初虽为应付一九四四年的大选，但大选后仍继续存在，为一永久性的组织，为三强团结世界和平以及进步民主而奋斗。
