　　Militias Coordinate with Local Armed Forces to Create Glorious Battle Examples
    Linzhang Eliminates the Pseudo-Army that Crossed the Zhang River and Invaded the North
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Local Armed Forces Resolve the Jiang Fifth Army's Supply Station
    Taiyue Xinhua Daily Calls for Continued Efforts to Support the Front Lines
    [This newspaper, Weixian, 16th] On the 13th, the local armed forces and militia of Linzhang County, Southern Hebei, coordinated to create a glorious example of the people's armed forces defending their homes, completely annihilating the pseudo-army that crossed the Zhang River from Anyang to invade the north. A total of 292 enemy soldiers, including the pseudo-Deputy Regiment Commander Zhao Chunchen, were killed, wounded, or captured. Only a few scattered and fled. All weapons were seized by our forces, including 32 light and heavy machine guns, one automatic rifle, over 290 rifles, five pistols, over 3,600 rounds of ammunition, 12 warhorses, and a set of telecommunications equipment. We only suffered seven minor injuries. This glorious victory of the people's armed forces in defending their homes greatly inspired the broad masses of farmers' movement to protect their homes.
    [This newspaper, Heze Front, 16th] Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan local armed forces, in coordination with the militia, completely resolved the rear headquarters supply station of the invading Jiang Army's Fifth Army, located in Maliang Village between Dangshan and Shanxian, on the evening of the 10th. The Fifth Battalion's medical company and a part of the local puppet army stationed there were also completely wiped out. In this battle, in addition to capturing over 150 personnel and weapons, over 31 large carts of military rice and several vehicles were seized. Because the roads were muddy and the vehicles could not be driven, they were burned. The development of this kind of guerrilla warfare is truly like a thorn in the back of the Jiang army invading our liberated areas, suffering attacks at every turn. The Jiang army is deeply panicked by this.
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 16th] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an article on the 10th, calling on the people of the entire region to continue their efforts to support the front lines, continue to strike at the reactionaries' offensive, persist in long-term struggle, and eliminate the idea of underestimating the enemy and paralysis. The editorial first analyzed the current Taiyue war situation, pointing out that a month's effort in the Tongpu and Southern Shanxi Self-Defense and Patriotic War had achieved unprecedented victory, but it was not a decisive and final victory. The enemy still maintains its active forces, and the warmongers will continue to attack the liberated areas. The editorial continued to point out: The enemy's situation in the past two months deserves our serious attention. Since the enemy has successively occupied Wen, Xia, Jiang, Hou, Yuan, and Yi, the enemies of Houma and Linfen have established contact, and the Linfeng (Lingdu) and Jiangyuan highways have been temporarily opened. Looking at their intentions, it is nothing more than first consolidating southern Shanxi as a base for expanding the civil war in Shanxi, and then waiting for an opportunity to invade the north. In addition, the Jiang army may also use Yuanqu as a base, taking the Huanghe ferry eastward, and controlling the Yuanqin highway to coordinate the Longhai campaign. The Jiang army's deployment seems to be ready, and a larger-scale war will inevitably come. The editorial called on the military and civilians throughout the region to continue to universally carry out self-defense war mobilization. All manpower and materials should be supported to the front lines. The rear should achieve a combination of labor and military affairs, defend the autumn harvest and autumn plowing, and rapidly change various peacetime organizational forms to make them more suitable for a long-term war environment. Persist in prolonged struggle. In temporarily occupied areas, it is necessary to further rely on the masses, protect the interests of the masses, and persist in and develop guerrilla warfare. The editorial finally called on the entire party and army to study the Central Bureau's "August 15th" instructions and the Liberation Daily editorial to stay clear-headed and overcome the idea of ​​underestimating the enemy and paralysis.

　　民兵配合地方武装创光辉战例
    临漳歼灭渡漳北犯伪军
    冀鲁豫地方武装解决蒋第五军兵站
    太岳新华日报号召再接再厉支援前线
    【本报威县十六日电】十三日冀南临漳县地方兵团与民兵配合，造成边地人民武装保家自卫战的一次光辉的战例，将自安阳渡漳河北犯的伪军全部歼灭，共毙伤俘伪副团长赵春臣以下二百九十二名，仅少数溃散，全部武器为我缴获，计轻重机枪三十二挺、自动步枪一支、步枪二百九十余支、短枪五枝、子弹三千六百余发，战马十二匹、电讯器材一部，我仅负轻伤七人，这一边地人民武装保家自卫战的光辉胜利，大大鼓舞了广大农民的保家运动。
    【本报荷泽前线十六日电】我冀鲁豫地方武装某部在民兵的配合下，十日晚将驻在砀山与单县间马梁村进犯蒋军第五军之后方总司令部兵站全部解决。并将驻在该地之第五大队卫生连及当地伪军一部，全部消灭。计此役除俘获人枪各一百五十余外，并缴获军用大米三十一大车、汽车数辆，因道路泥泞不能开动当被焚毁。此种游击战之展开，对于侵入我解放区之蒋军，诚为如芒在背，动辄遭受打击。蒋军对此深感恐慌。
    【本报阳城十六日电】太岳新华日报十日著论，号召全区人民再接再厉支援前线，继续打击反动派的进攻，坚持长期的斗争，肃清轻敌麻痹思想。该社论首先分析目前太岳战局，指出一月的努力，同蒲晋南自卫爱国战争，获致空前胜利，但不是决定性的最后的胜利，敌人尚保持着有生力量，好战分子还要持续的向解放区进攻。社论继续指出：两月来的敌情，值得我们严重注视，自敌人相继占我闻、夏、绛、侯、垣、翼等地，侯马与临汾之敌已取得联络，临风（陵渡）、绛垣、两条公路暂时被打通，窥其企图，不外首先巩固晋南，作为在山西扩大内战之基地，然后待机北犯，此外蒋军还可能以垣曲为基地，东向夺取黄河渡口，控制垣沁公路以策应陇海作战，蒋军这一部署似已就绪，更大规模的战争必将到来，该社论号召全区军民继续普遍的进行自卫战争动员。一切人力物力支援到前线上去，后方要做到劳武结合，保卫秋收、秋耕、迅速改变各种平时的组织形式，使之更加适合长期的战争环境，坚持持久的斗争，在暂时沦陷地区要进一步依靠群众，保护群众利益，坚持与发展游击战争。社论最后号召全党全军要学习中央局“八一五”指示，和解放日报社论清醒头脑，克服轻敌麻痹思想。
