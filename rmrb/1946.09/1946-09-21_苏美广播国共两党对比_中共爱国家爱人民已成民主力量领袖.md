　　Soviet and American Radio Comparison of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party
    The CCP Loves the Country and the People and Has Become the Leader of Democratic Forces
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] Moscow Radio on the 17th broadcast a clear comparison and analysis by Masinu on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, regarding the Chinese reactionaries and the Chinese democratic forces. He said: "Chinese democrats pointed out that the flames of the War of Resistance burned away the masks of the Kuomintang reactionaries, exposing the truth of their traitorous policies before the people. The Chinese Communist Party has proven before the people that they are true patriots, thoroughly upholding the interests of the people and the nation. U.S. Congressman DeLacy once said: The Kuomintang is a regime representing the big landlords and big capitalists, while the CCP is the thorough protector of the Chinese people. The CCP's platform advocates implementing democracy, improving the people's lives, and establishing democratic local organizations. This is true patriotism and democratic fighters. The CCP has become the main force in the national liberation war and the leader of the democratic forces. The CCP has achieved great victories in the War of Resistance and will also achieve victories in the post-war opposition to civil war, opposition to reactionaries, and the struggle for peace and democracy."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] New York Radio compared the CCP's platform with the Kuomintang's platform, saying: The CCP's platform has actually been implemented, especially regarding the demands of the people, while the Kuomintang has done nothing in its twenty years in power, and has not helped the farmers obtain land. The station also broadcast Wallace's quotation from an article in the Amerasia magazine, saying: The system established by the Kuomintang is a feudal, exploitative, and decadent system. The Amerasia magazine reporter said: The Kuomintang's post-war plan was drafted as early as the War of Resistance. In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek's book "China's Destiny" praised Zeng Guofan, who suppressed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement. This plan is now being implemented.

　　苏美广播国共两党对比
    中共爱国家爱人民已成民主力量领袖
    【新华社延安十八日电】莫斯科十七日广播，马西努在“九一八”十五周年前夜对中国反动派及中国民主力量作一鲜明的对照与分析。他说：“中国民主人士指出，抗战火焰烧毁了国民党反动派的假面具，在人民面前揭露了他们卖国政策的真相。中国共产党已在人民面前证明了他们是真正的爱国主义者，彻底拥护人民利益与民族利益的。美国众议员德拉西曾说：国民党是代表大地主大资本家的政权，中共是中国人民彻底的保护者。中共政纲主张实行民主改善人民生活，建立民主的地方组织，这是真正爱国主义者与民主战士。中共已成为民族解放战争的主力和民主力量的领袖，中共在抗战中已获巨大胜利，在战后反对内战、反对反动派、争取和平民主事业中也会获得胜利的。
    【新华社延安十七日电】纽约广播台将中共政纲与国民党政纲加以比较称：中共政纲实际上是实行了特别是对于人民的要求，而国民党当政二十年却什么也没有作，没有帮助农民获得土地。该台又广播华莱士引用美亚杂志的一段话说：国民党建立的制度是封建的剥削的腐朽的制度。美亚杂志记者说：国民党的战后计划早在抗日战争时期即拟定了，一九四三年蒋介石所著《中国之命运》一书，极力称赞镇压太平天国运动的曾国藩，这一计划现在正在实行中。
