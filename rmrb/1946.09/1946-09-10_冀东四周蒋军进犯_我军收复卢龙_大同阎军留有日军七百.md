　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 7th: Fierce fighting is occurring all around the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area. Lulong County, which was occupied by Jiang's troops on the 28th of last month, was recaptured by the Eighth Route Army on the 2nd. A portion of the 142nd Division of Jiang's troops on the Xianghe front invaded and occupied Xianghe County on the 5th. The 21st Division of Jiang's troops, reinforced from Tongxian to Yan Jiao on the 3rd and 4th, advanced along the highway towards Sanhe County starting on the 4th, capturing villages and towns such as Xiadian and Pan Gezhuang. The 166th Regiment of the 56th Division of Jiang's troops stationed in Shunyi along the Pinggu Road also invaded Yang Gezhuang (east of Tianjin) on the 5th to coordinate with the frontal attack on Sanhe. Jiang's troops in various locations on the eastern front of Eastern Hebei are also constantly on the move. On the 28th of last month, 400 Jiang's troops from Anshan and Shimen stations along the Beining Railway and a regiment of the 62nd Army of Jiang's troops in Changli were also on the move. The Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei is currently resolutely conducting self-defense counterattacks on all the above fronts.
    Xinhua News Agency, Huairen, 7th: According to refugees and Yan's puppet soldiers who recently escaped from Datong, there are currently over 700 Japanese troops in Datong, of which over 400 are incorporated into the Security Column, fully armed. They wear the old Japanese army short-style uniforms and leather shoes that were preserved from the past, but they wear Chinese army caps with the Blue Sky White Sun insignia. These military caps are made from disassembled Japanese army raincoats, and the original stitch marks from the sewing machines are still faintly visible. The Japanese communicate with each other in Japanese, and with Yan's puppet soldiers in broken Chinese. Only a few Japanese can speak fluent Chinese. Each of them has a Chinese name. The current commander of the 8th Special Task Regiment of Yan's puppet army, a Japanese named Sakamoto, has a Chinese pseudonym Chen Fengshan, which is only used for official documents, and he still uses his original Japanese name privately. They are treated better than Yan's puppet soldiers in terms of food and sleep, causing great dissatisfaction within Yan's puppet army.

　　冀东四周蒋军进犯
    我军收复卢龙
    大同阎军留有日军七百
    【新华社遵化七日电】冀东解放区四周均发生激烈战事，上月二十八日为蒋军侵占之卢龙县城，已于二日被八路军收复。香河前线蒋军一四二师一部，于五日侵陷香河县城，三四两日由通县增调燕郊的蒋军二十一师一部，于四日起沿公路向三河县城进犯，陷夏店、潘各庄等村镇。驻平古路顺义蒋军五十六师一六六团，亦于五日侵陷杨各庄（天津东），以配合三河正面之进攻。冀东东线各地蒋军亦不断蠢动，上月廿八日，北宁路安山、石门两车站蒋军四百及昌黎蒋军六十二军一个团，亦在蠢动。以上各线冀东八路军，刻正坚决进行自卫反击。
    【新华社怀仁七日电】据最近自大同逃出之难民及阎伪军士兵谈，大同现有日军七百余人，其中四百余人编入保安纵队，全副武装。他们穿的是旧日保存下来的日本陆军短式的军衣和皮鞋，头上戴的却是中国陆军军帽，缀有青天白日帽徽。这些军帽系用拆掉的日军雨衣改做而成，原有缝纽机的线迹仍依稀可见。日军相互用日语，与阎伪军则用半通不通的华语。仅有少数日军会说流利的中国话。他们每人有一个中国名字，现任阎伪军第八特务团团长日人坂本，其中国化名为陈丰山，仅作来往公文之用，私自仍用日本原名。彼辈吃饭睡觉都比阎伪军优遇，引起阎伪军内部极大不满。
