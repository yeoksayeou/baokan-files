　　Turning-Over Leader, Battlefield Hero
　　Liu Chaochen and his nephew bravely go to the front line to rescue the wounded under enemy fire, gloriously wounded
　　[Reported by our front-line reporter group in Heze, 17th] Our reporter Wu Xiang reports: In the battle to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 3rd Division, Liu Chaochen and his nephew, four members of the Liu family from Liu Village, District 1, Juancheng County, braved intense artillery fire, went to the front line and rescued ten wounded soldiers. Liu Chaochen and his third brother, Chaoxin, were both seriously wounded. When Liu Chaochen woke up from his coma in the aid station, his first words were: "For the sake of peace and democracy, for the sake of defending our liberated areas, and repelling Chiang Kai-shek's attack, I am not afraid of death. It is a pity that my leg is broken, and I can no longer carry the wounded." His family only has two and a half mu of land. Under his leadership, the tenant farmers in his village have all turned over, and he was recently elected as the chairman of the farmers' association. This time when Chiang Kai-shek's army invaded, he and his brothers Chaofu, Chaoxin, and an uncle carried a stretcher together, the whole family participating. He said to the other people: "When we turned over, I led everyone. When carrying the wounded, I will definitely be in front of everyone." He is tall and strong, but has lost too much blood, and his face is pale, but he is still excited to describe his experience to others: "... One fell down and another rushed up, the enemy had no choice but to retreat to the right, and we went up to collect the wounded. The enemy's machine gun swept over from the northeast corner, shooting up plumes of dust. How could I watch the comrades lying there and not go up? I bent over and ran over, carried one on my back and ran back, carrying and carrying, carrying back three. The fourth time I had just picked one up when I was hit by a machine gun. I gritted my teeth and still ran, blood flowing down my leg. I took a few steps and fell down, unable to get up again. I saw that the comrade had already sacrificed. I paused for a moment, the enemy's machine gun was still firing, so I pulled the comrade and crawled forward slowly with my hands..." Several wounded soldiers who were changing medicine next to him said to him excitedly: "Good fellow villager, as soon as our injuries heal, we will go to the front to avenge you."

　　翻身领袖战场英雄
    刘朝臣叔侄踊跃赴前线炮火中救伤员光荣负伤
    【本报荷泽前线记者团十七日电】本报记者吴象报导：在消灭蒋军嫡系第三师的战役中，鄄城一区大户刘庄刘朝臣叔侄四人冒着激烈炮火，上前线抢救出十个彩号，刘朝臣及三弟朝新皆负重伤。当刘朝臣在救护站中从昏迷中醒来时，第一句话就说：“为了和平民主，为了保卫咱们的解放区，打退蒋介石的进攻，我是不怕死的。可惜我的腿被打断，不能再去背彩号了。”他家里只有两亩半地，在他领导下的本村佃户都翻了身，最近被选为农会主席。这次蒋军进犯，他和弟弟朝服、朝新及一个叔叔合抬一付担架，全家出马，并对别的群众说：“翻身时我带领着大家，抬彩号时，我也一定在大家前头”。他身材魁伟，但流血过多，脸已发黄，但仍兴奋地向别人描述他的经历：“……一个躺倒了又一个冲了上去，敌人没办法退到右边，我们就上去收彩号。敌人机关枪从东北角扫过来。打得土卜卜的直冒。我怎么能看见同志们躺在那里不上去呢？我就湾着腰跑过去，背起来又向回跑，背呀背呀，背回了三个。第四次刚背起来就被机枪扫着了。我咬着牙还是跑，血就顺着腿流下来。跑了几步跌倒了，再也爬不起来，一看那个同志已经牺牲了。我停了一下，敌人机枪还在不住的扫，我就拉着那个同志用手慢慢往前爬……”在他旁边换药的几个彩号都很激动的对他说：“好老乡，我们伤一好就到前边去替你报仇。”
