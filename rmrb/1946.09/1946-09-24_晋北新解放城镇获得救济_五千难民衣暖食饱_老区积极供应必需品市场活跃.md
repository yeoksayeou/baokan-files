　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xinkou, 20th] Through two months of relief and reconstruction work by the democratic government, more than 5,000 refugees and impoverished citizens in the newly liberated areas of northern Shanxi have obtained proper employment and are living a life of warmth and sustenance. The democratic government allocated more than 300,000 jin of grain and countless clothes to relieve the impoverished citizens of Ningwu, Guoxian, Shuoxian, as well as Yuanping and Xuangang. More than 3,000 railway worker households received an average of more than 100 jin of grain per household, enabling them to resume production. Before liberation, Guoxian was subject to heavy taxation and extortion by the Yan puppet troops, and the people were without clothing or food, suffering from hunger and cold, wandering the streets in groups. The Relief Administration allocated flour, rice, clothing, and shoes and socks worth 380,000 yuan in Guanjin notes, but most of it was used by Yan Xishan for personal gain. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the city, it immediately allocated 200 shi of wheat to relieve the impoverished people and organized them to engage in production. At present, the masses are warm and well-fed. When Ningwu was liberated, there were more than 200 handicraft workers who could not make a living. After the democratic government provided relief and job referrals, their lives were no longer a concern.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xinkou, 20th] The supply of daily necessities to the towns in the newly liberated areas along the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been steadily shipped from the old liberated areas of Jin-Sui, and is no longer affected by Taiyuan and Datong. The market is becoming increasingly active. According to incomplete statistics, in recent months, a total of more than 100,000 jin of sesame oil, more than 80,000 shi of salt, and more than 7,000 bolts of cloth have been transported from the inland areas of northwestern Shanxi to the above-mentioned areas. All public and private shops have supplied goods to small and medium-sized merchants and vendors at low prices. The Ningwu United Inn adopted short-term commodity lending methods, uniting 130 small merchants and vendors. The Yuanping Dasheng Freight Station also organized more than 40 shops to promote the sale of daily necessities to meet the needs of farmers. Therefore, the prices of food, oil, salt and other goods are declining, generally reduced by 30 percent. The number of shops in various towns has rapidly increased by one to one and a half times. Shuoxian has increased from 130 shops to 240 shops, and hundreds of vendors. Guoxian has increased from 60 shops to 150 shops, and vendors have increased by more than 70. Fruit shops in Dai, Guo counties and Yuanping and Qicun have resumed business. Currently, more than 200 mules carry fruit from Guoxian, Yuanping, and Qicun to Ningwu and Shenchi every day.

    【新华社忻口二十日电】经民主政府两月来的救济恢复工作，晋北新解放区之各城镇五千余难民与贫苦市民都已得到正当职业，并过着温饱生活。民主政府拨出粮食三十余万斤，与衣服无数，救济宁武、崞县、朔县、及原平、轩岗之贫苦市民。铁路工人三千余户，平均每户得粮一百余斤，使他们得以恢复生产。崞县在解放前阎伪军横征暴敛，人民无衣缺食、饥寒交迫，结队流落街头，救济总署拨给价值三十八万元关金票之面粉、白米、衣服、鞋袜大部分为阎锡山私人所用，八路军解放此城后，立即拨小麦二百石，救济贫苦人民，并组织他们从事生产，目前群众均衣暖食饱。宁武解放时有二百余个手工业工人，无法生活，经民主政府救济与介绍职业后，生活无虑。
    【新华社忻口二十日电】同蒲北段沿线新解放区城镇之日用品之供应已由晋绥老解放区源源运到，已不受太原、大同两地影响，市场日渐活跃。据不完全统计，近月来由晋西北内地区运达上述各地之麻油共十万余斤，盐八万余石，布七千余匹，各公私商店均已低价供给中小商人摊贩货物。宁武联合客栈采用短期货物借贷办法，团结了一百三十家小商与摊贩。原平大胜货栈亦组织四十余家商店推销日用必需品，满足农民需要，因此食粮油盐等货物价日趋下降，一般均降低百分之三十。各城镇商铺迅速增加一倍及一倍半，朔县由一百三十家商号，增至二百四十家；摊贩百十家。崞县商店由六十家增至一百五十家，摊贩增加七十余家。代、崞两县及原平、奇村两地之水果店均已复业。现由崞县、原平、奇村运水果到宁武、神池的驮骡每天达二百余头。
