　　[From Our Correspondent in Handan] On the morning of August 27th, Chairman Yang convened a meeting of cadres from all levels of the Border Region Government, calling on everyone to work diligently to support the front lines. After briefly outlining the recent brilliant victories on all fronts against the civil war, Chairman Yang urged everyone to thoroughly eliminate any illusions, inherit the fighting spirit of the eight-year War of Resistance, work actively, diligently, practically, and enthusiastically, cherish material resources and manpower, practice austerity, and effectively support the front lines, striving together for the victory of the self-defense war. He then called for donations of materials and money, and the writing of letters of慰劳(condolences/support) to send to the soldiers at the front. A warm donation campaign has now been launched by the Border Region Government. (Zhou Qizhi)
