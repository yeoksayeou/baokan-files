　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. Tokyo Dispatch: The All Japan Seamen's Union issued a declaration on the 4th, protesting MacArthur's directive prohibiting strikes and decided to hold a general strike on the 10th of this month. MacArthur issued a directive on the 2nd prohibiting Japanese strikes, stating: If Japanese workers strike again, the American occupation forces will cooperate with the Japanese government to suppress them by force. The Yoshida Cabinet, on the day following MacArthur's directive, notified all 1.6 million unions of government employees at all levels, warning: If government employees at all levels strike again, they will be prosecuted for violating the Public Security Preservation Law.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Washington Dispatch: At a meeting of the Far Eastern Commission on August 30th, representatives from Australia, New Zealand and other countries opposed MacArthur's unauthorized approval of the Japanese reactionary constitution, because the committee had passed several principles for Japanese constitution-making in June, but MacArthur failed to follow these principles in instructing Japan to make the constitution. The Australian representative proposed to reject the reactionary constitution approved by MacArthur and demanded that the constitution be redrafted in accordance with the instructions of the Far Eastern Commission.

    抗议麦克阿瑟罢工禁令
    澳纽反对麦氏批准日宪法
    【新华社延安五日电】东京讯：全日本海员工会于四日发表宣言，抗议麦克阿瑟禁止罢工的指令，并决定本月十日举行总罢工。麦克阿瑟曾于二日颁发禁止日本罢工的指令内称：日本员工今后再有罢工，美占领军决协同日政府予以武力弹压。而吉田内阁则于麦氏指令次日照会所有一百六十万各级政府雇员的联合会警告称：如果各级政府雇员再行罢工，即以违反治安法治罪。
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：远东委员会于八月三十日开会时，澳洲、纽西兰等代表反对麦克阿瑟擅自批准日本反动派宪法，因该会曾于六月间通过日本制宪原则数项，但麦克阿瑟却未遵照此项原则指示日本制宪。澳代表提议否决麦氏所批准之反动宪法，要求依照远东委员会之指示重新制宪。
