　　A Sign of the Increasingly Serious Situation!
    The Masses Weekly Office Illegally Searched
    Nanjing CCP Delegation Lodges Protest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Shanghai News: The Shanghai office of the CCP's publication organ, *The Masses Weekly*, was suddenly illegally searched by the Kuomintang authorities. The CCP has lodged a protest with the authorities regarding this. At 6:00 PM on the 4th, seven individuals (six in plainclothes and one in police uniform) wearing short guns broke into Room 11, No. 25 Zhu Bao San Road, Shanghai, the office of *The Masses Weekly*. Ignoring the doorman's obstruction, they went straight into the editorial and business departments and ransacked the offices, claiming to be "under orders" to seize "the masses." Each person wore a "Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department" badge, but refused to produce official documents of accountability. As a result, 72 copies of *The Masses Weekly* were seized, but they refused to provide a receipt. On the 5th, the Shanghai police were ordered to tear up *The Masses Weekly* found on the market. In addition to lodging a protest with the relevant Shanghai authorities, the Nanjing CCP delegation is separately lodging protests via Xu Yongchang of the Committee of Three to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and via Zhang Lisheng, the government representative of the Political Consultative Conference, to the Kuomintang Ministry of Interior. A spokesperson for the CCP delegation stated: "This is a further manifestation of the Kuomintang fascist faction overturning resolutions, implementing fascist dictatorship and autocracy, and resolutely expanding the civil war. It is another ruthless mockery of Chiang Kai-shek's four promises and a sign of the increasingly serious situation." *The Masses Weekly* was first published in Hankou in 1938, with registration certificate Jing Zi No. 6865 from the Ministry of Interior. After the fall of Wuhan in 1938, it was moved to Chongqing for publication. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was moved to Shanghai for publication at the beginning of this year, and the change of address was filed, just as it was when it moved from Hankou to Chongqing, which is completely legal.

　　时局更加严重化的标志！
    群众周刊社遭非法搜查
    南京中共代表团已提抗议
    【新华社延安十七日电】沪讯：中共在沪言论机关《群众周刊》社，突被国民党当局非法武装搜查，中共对此已向当局提出抗议。四日下午六时，有佩短枪者七人（其中六人便衣一人为警察制服）闯入上海朱葆三路二十五号十一室《群众周刊》社，不顾阍人阻拦，直入编辑部经理部肆行搜查，将各办公桌乱翻，自称系“奉令”来拿“群众”的。各人咸戴有“上海警备司令部稽查处”佩章，但又不肯出示官方负责之公文，结果抢去《群众周刊》七十二本，但又拒给收条。五日上海警察又奉令撕毁市场上的《群众周刊》。该社除就近已向上海有关机关提出抗议外，南京中共代表团正分别经由三人委员会徐永昌向上海警备司令部及政协政府代表张厉生向国民党内政部提出抗议。中共代表团发言人认为：“这是国民党法西斯派推翻决议、厉行法西斯独裁专制、决心扩大内战之进一步的行动表现，是对蒋介石之四项诺言又一次无情的讽刺，也是时局更加严重化的标志。”按《群众周刊》于民国二十七年创刊于汉口，领有内政部登记证警字第六八六五号。二十七年武汉失守即移至重庆出版，抗战胜利后已于本年初移沪出版，并业已呈请变更地址一如由汉迁渝时一样是完全合法的。
