　　[This newspaper reports] The Anyang County Party Committee Comrade Sun Ziying reports: After a large-scale, universal, and in-depth land reform movement in the county in July, as of August 10th, except for 82 villages in the border areas (accounting for one-fifth of the county's villages), the remaining seven districts and 325 villages have initially achieved "land to the tiller," and the vast majority of poor peasants have generally gained land. In the past, when fighting, the masses in a village would get 100 or 200 *shi* of grain, and the cadres would think it was quite a lot, but the masses would say, "It delays work and we can't turn over." This time, the masses adopted a thorough method of settling accounts. Fucheng Village calculated 16,000 *shi* of rice (20-斤 *jin* per *dou*), and the northeast street of Shuiye calculated 30,000 *shi*. Many villages had 2,000 or 3,000 *shi* or more. According to statistics from 60 villages, a total of more than 79,000 *mu* of land were recovered in 20 days; 13,800 rooms, 761 head of livestock, more than 75,700 *shi* of grain, more than 2,500 *jin* of cotton, and many other items were recovered from 80 villages. Because the masses generally obtained land, houses, grain, and materials, they were all excitedly talking about, "The landlords and despots can't oppress us anymore! This is what it really means to turn over!" The people's patriotic self-defense war enthusiasm reached an unprecedented high. For example, in the Second District, which originally required 100 people to join the army, 217 people signed up after only one mobilization meeting of activists. Young and middle-aged people in various villages in the district flocked to the troops in platoons and companies.

　　The County Party Committee's leadership in this movement was, first, to grasp the most urgent demand of more than 90% of the masses—to settle the accounts of the feudal ruling groups in various villages during the enemy and puppet period, who relied on the enemy's power to plunder the masses' blood and sweat without limit. For example, if the enemy levied eight *jin* of cotton per *yuan* of poll tax, the village would levy 25 *jin*; if they levied two *jin* of copper per *yuan* of poll tax, the village would levy eight *jin*. The masses of all classes were heartbroken when they mentioned this, so the struggle was particularly fierce. The second was to completely let the masses do it themselves. Let the masses choose their own targets of struggle (the leadership only pointed out the principles), settle accounts themselves, and demand payment themselves. Only after the masses had thoroughly defeated the feudal rulers economically and politically did the leadership guide the masses to make a turn, giving them a share of things to maintain their lives and engage in production. This turn was generally very smooth. Third, a completely united approach was adopted towards the middle peasants, so that the middle peasants also participated in the movement and obtained the fruits of the struggle. However, when resolving past problems, letting the poor peasants return the land they had redeemed from the middle peasants dampened the enthusiasm of some poor peasants. This was not right, and the leadership is paying attention to correcting it. Fourth, instead of slowly trying to get through the masses' thoughts before doing anything, the method of encouragement and ignition was adopted. The leading cadres clearly expressed their complete support for all the masses' actions to turn over, called on the masses to thoroughly redress their grievances and avenge themselves, and used the crimes confessed by secondary rulers and chiefs to stimulate the masses. In many villages, a widespread outpouring of grievances and accusations was launched with just one strong mobilization meeting. Fifth, instead of adopting the method of completely overthrowing the bad village cadres who were opposed by the masses in the past, the method of "replacing the lurking running dogs and washing the faces and blackening those cadres who were bought off midway" was adopted, thus saving and transforming a large number of village cadres and accelerating the progress of the movement. Only a few of the worst were subjected to appropriate struggle.

　　安阳清算运动普遍深入
    三百余村群众获得耕地
    翻身农民参战情绪空前高涨
    【本报讯】安阳县委孙子英同志报导：该县经过七月份大规模普遍而深入的清算运动，截至八月十日止，除边沿区八十二村（占全县村庄五分之一）外，其余七个区三二五村已初步作到耕者有其田，广大贫农已普遍获得耕地。过去斗争时一个村子的群众得到一、二百石粮食，干部就觉得很不少了，群众则反映“误了工翻不了身”。这次运动群众采取了彻底清算的办法。阜城一村即算出一万六千石米（二十斤斗），水冶东北街算出三万石，两三千石以上的村子很多。据六十个村统计：二十天中共算回土地七万九千多亩；八十个村算回房屋一万三千八百多间，牲口七百六十一头，粮食七万五千七百多石，棉花二千五百多斤及其他物品甚多。群众因普遍获得土地、房屋与粮食、物资，到处都在兴致勃勃的谈论着：“地主恶霸们以后可不能再压迫咱啦！这才真叫翻身哩！”人民的爱国自卫战争热情空前高涨。如二区原来要求一百人参军，只开了一个积极分子动员会，就有二百一十七人报了名。该区各村青壮年成班成排的涌入部队。
    县委对这次运动的领导，第一是抓住了百分之九十以上群众最迫切的要求——清算敌伪时期各村封建统治集团依仗敌势，无限制掠夺群众的血汗账。如敌人每元丁洋派八斤花，村里就派二十五斤；每元丁洋派二斤铜，村里就派八斤。各阶层群众一提这事就痛心疾首，所以斗争起来分外剧烈。第二是彻底放手让群众干。让群众自己选择斗争对象（领导上只指出原则），自己清算，自己要账。领导上只在群众将封建统治者从经济上、政治上彻底击垮以后，才引导群众转湾，恩赐他们一份东西维持生活和从事生产。这湾子一般都转得非常顺利。第三、对中农完全采取了团结的方针，使中农同样参加运动并获得斗争果实。但在解决过去问题时，让贫农退还赎自中农的土地，曾打击了部份贫农情绪。这是不对的，领导上已在注意补正。第四、不是慢腾腾的去打通了群众思想以后再干，而是采取了鼓动与点火办法，由领导干部明确表示彻底支持群众一切翻身斗争行动，号召群众彻底申冤报仇，并将次要统治者与保长等所坦白的罪恶去激发群众。好多村子都是一个强烈的动员大会就展开了普遍的诉苦申冤。第五、对过去为群众所反对的坏村干部不是采取一律打倒的办法，而采取了“撤换潜入的狗腿，给中途被收买的干部洗脸擦黑”的办法，这样挽救与改造了大批村干，加速了运动进程。只对个别最坏的，进行了适当斗争。
