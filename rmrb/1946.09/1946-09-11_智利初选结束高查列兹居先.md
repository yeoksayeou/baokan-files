Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Santiago, Chile - Gabriel González Videla, supported by the Chilean Communist Party and the majority faction of the Radical Party, has taken the lead in the presidential election held on September 4th. González Videla, currently a Radical Party senator, received 189,606 votes. He was followed by Conservative Party candidate Cruz, who received 141,585 votes. Third was Liberal Party Senator Hernando, with 128,721 votes. Socialist Rinnaldo received the fewest votes, with 11,922. The total number of registered voters was 841,000, with a turnout of 70 to 80 percent. According to the constitution, the Chilean president is elected every nine years, and a candidate must obtain more than half of the total votes to be elected. Therefore, this election is not the final result, and one of the candidates with the most votes must be selected at a joint session of Congress 50 days later. The Chilean Congress consists of 45 senators and 147 representatives. The right wing has a majority in the Senate, and the left wing has an advantage in the House of Representatives. The Radical Party is the largest party in Congress, with seven seats in the Senate and more than forty seats in the House of Representatives. The Communist Party has three seats in the Senate and more than ten seats in the House of Representatives. Both parties are supporters of the Chilean Popular Front. The Popular Front also includes the Socialist Party and was founded in 1938. It won the election in that year and formed a people's government. It won an overwhelming victory in the 1941 election, completely controlling both houses of Congress; it only lost some seats in the election last March. The Chilean Communist Party is the most organized and prestigious party in Chile, with a particularly large influence among general workers and suburban farmers. Prominent leaders include Contreras, Pedro, and Elias. In 1942, it had 72,000 members.

　　智利初选结束高查列兹居先
    【新华社延安八日电】智利京城讯：为智利共产党及激进党多数派所支持的高查列兹，已在九月四日举行的总统选举中占第一位。高查列兹现为激进党参议员，得一八九点六○六票。其次为保守党候选人克卢兹，得一四一点五八五票。第三为自由党参议员何南多，得一二八点七二一票。社会党人日纳多得票最少，为一一点九二二票。全体登记选民共八十四万一千人，投票者占百分之七十至八十之间。根据宪法，智利总统每九年选举一次，候选人须获得总票数的过半数才能当选，故此次大选尚非最后结果，须待五十日后国会联席会议上在得票最多的几位候选人中选择其一。智利国会分有参议员四十五人，与众议员一百四十七人，参议员中右派占多数，众议员中左派占优势。激进党为国会中第一大党，在参院中有七席，在众院中有四十余席。共产党在参院中有三席，在众院中有十余席。两党均为智利人民阵线的支持人。人民阵线尚包括社会党，成立于一九三八年，在是年大选中获胜，组成人民政府，在一九四一年的大选中又获压倒优势，完全控制参众两院；只是在去年三月选举中失去若干议席。智利共产党为智利最有组织最有声望的一个党，在一般工人与城郊农民中影响特大，著名领袖有康特里拉斯、皮得罗、伊利阿斯等，一九四二年即有党员七万二千人。
