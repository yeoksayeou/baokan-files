Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: New York airmail reports: The Communist Party of the United States issued a declaration on the 7th, July 23rd, reviewing the U.S. policy towards China based on Madame Sun's remarks. The declaration stated: "World peace, especially American peace, is in extreme danger due to the U.S.'s current instigation of the Kuomintang to engage in civil war." "What the U.S. authorities and the like of Vandenberg and Byrnes want to do in China is no different from what Hitler and Mussolini did in Spain when they cultivated the Franco regime." "American imperialists imposing their will on the people of the Far East not only threatens the security of China and the Far East, but also threatens the security of the world." "It is the shared responsibility of all peace-loving Americans and Chinese to defeat the dangerous conspiracy of Chinese and American reactionaries." "The Communist Party of the United States has always regarded China's democratic unity as an inseparable factor in creating a world free from war and fascism." The article continued to review the China policy after Stilwell and Gauss, and elaborated on the demands of the CPC, the Democratic League, university professors, and student self-government associations for the United States to change its policy. Finally, it called on "friends who advocate freedom for China, friends of world peace, to organize rallies, demonstrations, and marches, issue declarations, write letters to members of Congress and government officials, demanding the withdrawal of all American troops from Chinese territory, the cessation of training Kuomintang troops, the withdrawal of the U.S. military advisory group, the withdrawal of all forms of transportation and supply to the Kuomintang army, the cessation of all shipments of military supplies to the Kuomintang government, no loans to the Kuomintang dictatorial regime, the defeat of the congressional "Military Aid to China Act," and to demand that assistance be given to China only after the establishment of a unified democratic government in China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: Moscow Radio on the 8th: Professor Maslennikov, in a speech in Moscow, denounced the U.S. policy towards China, saying: "American financial capitalists are openly preparing to restore their rule over China. The intention of American reactionaries to help Chinese reactionaries is to create a victory for the reactionary forces, so that they themselves can become the actual masters of this extremely fertile country." Maslennikov continued: The United States "is dumping cheap textile goods into China at low prices, squeezing out Chinese goods, and thus has undermined China's national industry."

    【新华社延安九日电】纽约航讯：美国共产党在七日二十三日发表宣言，就孙夫人谈话检讨美国对华政策。宣言说：“世界的和平，特别是美国的和平，由于美国目前煽动国民党从事内战而陷于极度的危险中。”美国当局与范登堡、贝纳斯之流，想在中国做出来的正与当年希特勒与墨索里尼在西班牙培植佛朗哥政权无异。”“美国帝国主义分子把他们的意志强加于远东人民身上，不但威胁中国与远东安全，而且也威胁着其世界的安全。”“击败中美反动派危险阴谋，是一切爱好和平的美国人与中国人同具的责任。”“美国共产党一直以中国的民主团结为不可分离的因素，以缔造一个免于战争与法西斯世界。”该文继续检讨史迪威、高思以后的对华政策，并阐述中共、民盟、联大教授与学生自治会各项宣言对美国改变政策的要求。最后号召“主张中国自由的友人们，世界和平的友人们组织集会示威游行，发表宣言，写信给国会议员与政府官吏们，要求撤回一切中国领土上的美国军队，停止训练国民党军队，撤回美国军事顾问团，撤回一切形式的对国民党军队的运输和供应，停运一切军用品给国民党政府，不给国民党独裁政权以任何借贷，击败国会“军事援华法案”，要求只在中国民主统一的政府成立以后，才给中国以援助。
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科八日广播：马斯列尼可夫教授在莫斯科讲演中，痛斥美国的对华政策，他说：“美国金融资本家正公开地准备恢复其对中国的统治，美国反动分子帮助中国反动派的打算，是造成反动势力的胜利，来使他们自己作为这个极其丰肥的国家的实际主人。”马氏继称：美国“正以低价的纺织商品向中国倾销，排挤中国商品，因此已破坏了中国的民族工业”。
