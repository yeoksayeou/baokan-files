　　Words from the Heart
    Ya Wei
    We had just arrived at the Niushi Street Public Office in Xingtai City when an old woman, about sixty-two years old, approached us with a joyful smile. In her aged voice, she said:
    "I knew you were coming. Rest here, let me welcome you." She then told us:
    "My family name is Wang, and there are five people in my family. We are completely penniless. We don't have a single piece of land, and two of the children are too young to work. We rely on my son selling meat to make a living. In the past, for every pound of meat he sold, the local Baozhang (local leader) would take four ounces as tax. The sheepskin and sheep blood completely belonged to them, and we also had to pay the 'head tax,' making it impossible for my family to survive." Speaking of this, she let out a long breath. "Granny, we are the Peking University Turn-Over Team, here to help the poor to turn over and be liberated," The old woman's smile made her wrinkles seem deeper, and she raised her voice and said:
    "We are one family. I know the Eighth Route Army is the people's army." As she spoke, she leaned closer and lowered her voice, "We are now settling accounts with the puppet Baozhang, Wang Cong. His family has three qing (approx. 5 hectares) of land, ten or so waterwheels. When the Eighth Route Army came, that dog ran away. Before, we calculated that he had one hundred and fifty thousand yuan, which wasn't even enough to pluck a hair from his head. Now we are recalculating. I am his aunt, and he wouldn't lend me a single grain of rice; his own uncle has to beg for food. He would rather let the sparrows and rats ruin the grain than give it to the poor! It's so unbearable to be hungry, but we don't dare to speak up." The old woman saw that we were about to have breakfast, so she ladled some of her noodle soup for us to drink.
    I quickly finished my meal and walked into the old woman's courtyard. She was sitting next to a pot of monthly roses, picking through briquettes. When she saw me enter, she grabbed my hand and asked me to sit beside her. She said:
    "When the enemy was here, we couldn't sell meat. There were too many things that were 'against the law,' forcing us to sell tables, chairs, and benches, and even pawn our house. If my old man were still alive, he would be eighty years old this year. Because the traitor Yang Shuyuan oppressed him, he was sick for four years and died at the age of seventy-eight. My child, Wang Qin, was also forced to be seriously ill, ruining his hand, and he can't use it freely! When I see Yang Shuyuan, I will definitely cut his flesh and eat it!" The old woman spoke even more excitedly, gesticulating as she continued!
    "On August 12th (lunar calendar) last year, Xingtai was liberated. The Eighth Route Army came, and our lives became different. We don't have to pay taxes for selling meat, and we are not afraid of 'breaking the law'! When we go out to sell meat, it's sold out in no time. Look, my family is eating meat now," Then she stood up, lifted the pot lid for me to see, and the aroma of meat wafted out. She smiled: "Comrade, it's really different now. In the past, we didn't even have bran to eat..."
    The calls from my comrades outside interrupted the old woman's words, and I was eager to gather, so I said goodbye. The old woman saw me to the door and said:
    "Come over and stay at our house."
    Even after walking a long distance, I looked back and could still see her frosty white hair, shimmering in the scorching sunlight.

　　心坎的话
    雅微
    我们刚走到邢台市牛市街公所，一个六十二岁的老太太喜眉笑脸的靠近了我们，用她衰老的声调说：
    “我知道你们来啦，在这里休息，我来欢迎欢迎你们，”随着她告诉我们：
    “我家姓王，一共有五口人，是个穷光蛋。地无一垄，两个小孩还不能劳动啦，凭我儿子卖肉度日。在过去卖一斤肉，人家保长就得抽四两，羊皮，羊血，完全是属于人家，还得上‘割头税’，弄得俺家不能活”。谈到这里，她长长的出了一口气，“老大娘，我们是北大的翻身队，来帮助穷人翻身的，”老太太的笑脸显得皱纹更深了，就提高了嗓子说：
    “咱们是一家人，我知道八路军是老百姓的队伍。”她说着又凑近些，压低了声音，“我们这里现在与伪保长王葱算账啦，他家有三顷地，十来辆水车，八路军来，他狗×跑啦，以前算了他一百五十万块钱，不顶拔人家一根毛，现在又重算啦。我是他的叔伯妗子借不出他一粒米；他亲舅还得讨饭吃；他宁把那些麻雀，老鼠糟踏下的粮食投到水里，都不给穷人吃！真是饿的你没办法，不敢张嘴”。王老太太看见我们要进早餐了，便给我们舀了她的面汤让我们喝。
    我急急地吃完了饭，走到老太太的院子里。她坐在一盆月季花旁边，拣着料炭，见我进去了，一把拉住我让我在她的身边坐下，她说：
    “敌人在的时候，俺不能卖肉，‘犯法’的事太多了，逼得俺卖桌，卖椅，卖凳子，把我的房子也当了出去。我老汉在世的话，今年八十岁了，因为汉奸杨树源逼得他病了四年，七十八岁的那年去世了。我孩子王钦，也叫逼得病了一大场，把手闹坏了，不随便啦！我见了杨树源非割着吃他的肉不行！”老太太说得更起劲了，指手划足的又接下去！
    “去年八月十二（旧历）解放了俺邢台，八路军来了，俺的生活就不一样了。卖肉也不用上税，也不怕‘犯法’啦！出去卖肉，一会儿就卖完啦。你看我家现在也吃的是肉，”接着她站起来揭开锅盖让我看，锅内喷出肉香她笑了：“同志，可不一样了，过去吃糠都没有。………”
    外面同志们的叫声，打断了王老太太的话语，我急着要去集合就告了辞。王老太太送出门来说：
    “过来了，住咱家”。
    走得很远了，我回过头去，还看见她那霜白的头发，闪烁在灼热的阳光下。
