　　Protesting MacArthur's Aid to Reactionaries
    Japanese Seamen Hold General Strike
    National Railway Employees Issue Joint Statement in Support
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】 Tokyo dispatch: The All-Japan Seamen's Union launched a general strike on the 10th, completely halting all sea traffic throughout the country. The union issued a declaration opposing MacArthur's assistance to the reactionary Yoshida government in suppressing the strike, and demanding that the people of Allied countries unite to support the Japanese democratic movement and urge the American authorities to abide by the Potsdam Declaration. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union announced on the evening of the 10th that railway workers support the Japanese seamen's strike and warned MacArthur that if he does not rescind the order prohibiting strikes, all Japanese National Railway workers will hold a general strike on the 25th. On the 8th, 6,000 Japanese textile workers gathered in the Imperial Palace Plaza to hold a demonstration protesting MacArthur's protection of reactionaries. American military police attempted to disperse the demonstration, but because the workers were united and unyielding to force, they successfully completed their original plan, surrounding the Prime Minister's residence and sending Yoshida a "petition" demanding his immediate departure. In addition, according to a report by the United Press, dancers in several dance halls owned by the U.S. military launched a strike on the 4th to protest the U.S. military's insults to Japanese women. When dancing, all the dancers only lifted their legs halfway, and when singing, only their mouths moved, without any sound being heard.

　　抗议麦克阿瑟援助反动派
    日本海员举行总罢工
    国铁员工联合声明拥护
    【新华社延安十二日电】东京讯：全日本海员工会于十日发动总罢工，全国所有海路交通已完全停顿。工会发表宣言，反对麦克阿瑟协助吉田反动政府镇压罢工，要求同盟国家人民一致奋起声援日本民主运动，督促美国当局遵守波茨顿宣言。同时日本国营铁路员工联盟发言人于十日晚宣称：铁路员工拥护日本海员的罢工，并向麦克阿瑟警告说，如果麦氏不收回禁止罢工成命，全日本国营铁路员工将于二十五日举行总罢工。而八日日本纺织工人有六千名在皇宫广场集合举行抗议麦氏庇护反动派的示威游行时，美国军宪曾企图冲散示威队伍，但因工人团结一致，不为威武所屈，终仍胜利完成原定计划，包围首相官邸，向吉田送上“申请书”，要他即时滚蛋。此外据合众社报导：美军拥有的数家舞厅舞女，于四日发动罢工，抗议美军侮辱日本妇女的行为，当跳舞时，所有舞女均把腿只抬出一半，唱歌时只见嘴动弹，不闻声音。
