On the basis of victory in the land redemption struggle, the movement deepens.
	North Dongfang Village Clears "Black Bureaus"
	Big Traitor Zhu Fang Executed, People Cheer
	Countless Murders, Death by a Thousand Cuts Not Enough
[This newspaper reports from Linzhang] After the victory in the land redemption struggle in Beidongfang Village, our county, hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants are increasingly united. In August, a widespread mass movement against traitors, local bullies, and "black bureaus" was launched, thoroughly exposing the towering crimes of the ruling clique. Zhu Fang, the head of the ruling clique in the village, was a traitor and came from a bandit background. After the Incident, he maintained the enemy in the village. In 1943, in the name of the head of thirteen nearby villages, he invited the bandit traitors Han × and Ma Fusheng to jointly establish a "bureau," colluding with the traitor Guo Qing. He built a blockhouse in the village, and he became the supreme emperor of the surrounding villages. He trafficked drugs, raped women, and murdered for money, committing all kinds of evil. The poor peasant Liu Peiming had a slight disagreement with him and was buried alive with the charge of "communicating with the Eighth Route Army." Wang Jinyu, Li Shaoqun, Li Youlin, and others were forced to scatter their families for the same reason and did not dare to return home for several years. The traitor Zhu arbitrarily bought things to eat and drink from grain merchants in Zhangli Market without paying, and even beat, scolded, and deducted money, forcing the merchants to close their doors. When grain merchant Wang Zaixian slightly expressed dissatisfaction, he was detained by the bureau and beaten to near death. Finally, he offered forty-seven bags of grain to entertain guests and apologize to end the matter. The peasants in the village were forced to organize the "Red Spear Society" to confront the "bureau." Many mills in Beidongfang Village were extorted to the point of shutting down. The traitor Zhu cursed on the street: "Even if all the mills are shut down, you still have to support me! I have plenty of guns, whoever disobeys will be shot dead!" The traitor Zhu colluded with the local bullies and landlords in the village, Wang Yunsheng, Zhao Rui, Zhao Tonggong, etc. They served as village chiefs, allocated and spent grain and money. They often gave gifts to the enemy, and once they sent seven large carts of watermelons. They ate, drank, and reveled extravagantly when they went to the city, spending over 250,000 yuan on prostitutes at one time. When accounting, they wrote that someone in the village was communicating with the Eighth Route Army and was fined. The enemy allocated bean flour at four mao per jin, but it was issued to the village at one yuan per jin. Moreover, it was only issued to large households, and poor people could not buy a jin even if they wanted to pay 2.5 yuan. The village chiefs drove carts to use it as fertilizer on the fields. The enemy allocated foreign cloth, salt, matches, towels, and soap, all of which were embezzled. They collected cotton for the enemy, and other villages required 30 jin per mu, which was unbearable for the peasants. However, Beidongfang required 60 jin. The masses were forced to sell their land and houses and flee to other places. The poor peasant Zhang Cheng was forced to hang himself. The rich peasant Zhao Hua was also angered to death. Many families had the flower patterns removed from their clothes and quilts, leaving children crying from the cold. The masses prepared to go to the city to petition, but Zhu Fang discovered this and arrested Zhang Jun, the leader, and his fate is unknown. Zhang Hua couldn't afford the flower patterns and angrily said, "It's better to have been in the society (Red Spear Society)," and Zhu Fang shot him dead. Even selling land in the village had to go through Zhu Fang. The saying was: "With Zhu Fang's foot stomp, the boundary of the land has to give way several ridges, who dares to say a word!"

　　赎地胜利基础上运动深入
    北东坊清算“黑局子”
    巨奸朱方伏法万众欢呼
    杀害人命数不清千刀万剐也不亏
    【本报临漳讯】本县北东坊村于赎地斗争胜利后，雇、贫、中农日益团结。八月份更深入展开了广大群众性的反汉奸恶霸与反“黑局子”斗争，彻底揭发统治集团的滔天罪恶。该村统治集团首脑汉奸朱方，土匪出身。事变后在村维持敌人。民国三十二年，以附近十三村保长名义请土匪汉奸韩×与马福生来伙立“局子”，勾结汉奸郭清，在村里盖起炮楼，自己即成了周围村庄人民的太上皇。贩卖毒品，强奸妇女，谋财害命，无恶不作。贫农刘培明和他稍有嫌隙，被安上“通八路”罪名活埋了。王金玉、李少群、李友林等因同一原因，被逼得家人四散，几年不敢回家。朱逆在章里集的粮行商家任意买东西吃喝不给钱，还要打骂扣罚，逼得商家都关了门。粮行经纪王在贤略表不满，即被局子扣押，打的死去活来。最后出了四十七布袋粮食，请客赔罪才罢。该村农民，则被逼得全村组织“红枪会”，与“局子”对抗。北东坊许多家磨坊被讹得停工了，朱逆在当街破口大骂：“磨坊全停了也得养活老子！老子有的是枪，谁不服打死谁！”朱逆与村里恶霸地主王允生、赵瑞、赵桐公等结成一气，保长由他们当，粮款由他们派，由他们花。他们经常给敌人送礼，有一次送西瓜就送了七大车。进城时大吃大喝，花天酒地，一次嫖姑娘花过二十五万元。出账时写的是因村内有人通八路，被罚了款。敌人配给豆面四毛钱一斤，发给村里是一元一斤。且只发给大户，穷人想以二元五买一斤都不行。保长们却一车车拉去当粪上了地。敌人配给洋布、食盐、火柴、毛巾、肥皂、都贪污了。替敌人收棉花，别村一亩地三十斤，农民就过不下去了；北东坊却要六十斤。群众被迫纷纷卖地卖房，逃荒出走。贫农张成逼得上吊死了；富农赵华，也逼得气死了。许多人家被夺去了衣服被子里的花套，冻得儿嚎女叫。群众准备进城请愿，被朱逆发觉，将为首的张俊抓走，生死不明。张华出不起花，气得说了一句“还不如在了会（红枪会）哩”，即被朱逆枪杀了。该村农民连卖地也必须经过朱逆。所谓“朱方脚一蹬，地界得让好几垅，谁敢啃一声！”
