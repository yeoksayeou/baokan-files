　　The Eighth Route Army Saved Our Lives!
    ——Communication from the Longhai Front
    On August 19th, in a village near Heze city, I interviewed several Northwest Army officers who had laid down their weapons at Lanfeng and Liuhe railway stations. One was Zhang Yunsheng, a platoon leader of the 9th platoon, 3rd battalion, 220th regiment, 74th brigade, 55th division; another was Wang Guoxing, the company commander of the 8th company; and the third was Liu Zhiguo, the company commander of the 4th company, 86th regiment, 74th brigade, 55th division.

    I was reading a Chinese Times newspaper, which read: "Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th dispatch: The 'government army' re-enlistment and reorganization work is continuing... Previously, General He Chengjun had requested retirement. This time, there are also fifteen generals including General Feng Yuxiang, Wan Fulin, Lu Zhonglin, Li Jishen, and two hundred and seventeen lieutenant generals including Duan Zunhua, and five hundred and seventy-six major generals including Liu Binghuan, a total of eight hundred and eight people, along with more than fourteen thousand junior and mid-level cadres." I was drawn to this news. At this moment, Zhang Yunsheng came. After hearing this news, a gloomy expression appeared on his face. He lowered his head and remained silent for a long time, then sighed with emotion. He said, "A part of this list is from the Northwest Army, but there are also some generals from the Northeast Army, such as Wan Fulin. But their fates are the same, and they are now gradually being eliminated by the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek.

    "The reason why our Northwest Army was lucky enough not to be completely wiped out in the past was because there was still Feng Yuxiang. The brothers all said, 'As long as General Feng Yuxiang has food to eat, the Northwest Army can still have a bowl of rice.' Once he leaves, everyone will be finished."

    "The Northwest Army is not satisfied with Old Chiang, but no one dares to say it out loud. Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of troops are constantly expanding, and they are the ones enjoying the benefits, while our Northwest Army is suffering. When fighting, the Northwest Army is placed in front to charge. When issuing military uniforms, Chiang Kai-shek's officers wear very beautiful twill uniforms, while the Northwest Army wears coarse cloth clothes. The Northwest Army's guns are all old and broken Hubei-made ones, while Hu Zongnan's troops are all equipped with the latest American weapons..." His voice became louder and louder, and he showed a sad and indignant emotion: "Chiang Kai-shek has adopted a gradual elimination method for the Northwest Army, from large to small, from small to none. Cao Fulin's 55th Army was reorganized into the 55th Division, the 29th Division was reorganized into the 29th Brigade, the 74th Division was reorganized into the 74th Brigade, and the 181st Division was reorganized into the 181st Brigade. The 99th Army alone eliminated cadres from three regiments, totaling more than a thousand people. Those who were eliminated, because of the civil war, one-third went to the officers' training corps, and two-thirds went home or engaged in business along the Longhai Railway. There are many old and disabled officers who cannot return with a large group of wives and children, wandering the streets, and their lives are very miserable. This is the end of the Northwest Army officers. Can everyone not feel chilled when they see this? Everyone's hope is when will the reorganization be completed, and it will be considered done if they are dismissed sooner. The reason why it is not completed quickly now is mainly because the Northwest Army can still be used to fight the civil war, acting as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. Once Chiang Kai-shek sees that they are no longer needed, they can be kicked away."

    Speaking of this, he took a deep breath, and his eyes were covered with a layer of tears. Since enlisting, he had spent thirteen years in the army, from Jiaoxian, Jiaodong, to Ji＠, from Ji＠ to Jiujiang, Jingmen, Zhongxiang, Nanyang, Tang County..., only after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War did he transfer to Xuchang, Kaocheng, and Lanfeng.

    Company commanders Liu Zhiguo and Wang Guoxing also arrived. They also said that the Northwest Army had no future under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Liu said, "The officers who were eliminated were all overjoyed because they could go home. But Chiang Kai-shek would not let them go home and forced them to enter the officers' training corps. In Yang Cheng's troops, each company had an instructor sent by Chiang Kai-shek, all of whom graduated from military academies and received special agent training in political training groups. They specialized in investigating the thoughts, actions, and private situations of officers and soldiers in the unit, and sent a report to the political department every week. The officers and soldiers in the company hated them very much and called them medicine peddlers. Now the Northwest Army only has Cao Fulin's one division left, and currently only three brigades (four regiments) are left, with more than two thousand seven hundred people per regiment. There is also Mi Wenkou's 181st Division, which is only about six thousand people. This time, Cao Fulin participated in the civil war, and more than four thousand people were eliminated, and part of the 29th Division was also eliminated.

    The officers of the Northwest Army are unwilling to fight the civil war. They all say: "Why are we fighting our own people? I am here, and my older brothers are all in the Eighth Route Army. Isn't this fighting my own brothers? In the past, it was glorious to sacrifice and shed blood in the Anti-Japanese War. Now, because Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country and fighting the civil war, how worthless is it to shed blood!" After the outbreak of this civil war, the soldiers fled one after another when they heard that they were fighting the Eighth Route Army. During the battle at Liuhe East Station, the instructor and deputy company commander broke through. I led a platoon without fighting. None of the personnel and weapons were lost. We laid down our weapons. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to fight the civil war, and everyone feels heartbroken. It is not allowed to ask for leave, and it is impossible to escape, so we took this opportunity to lay down our weapons.

    "We can see Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war very clearly. The American help of Chiang Kai-shek's planes and artillery must have its conditions. Chiang Kai-shek wants the Americans' things, and the American reactionaries want our country. Now our country has been controlled by the United States." After a long silence, Wang Guoxing said with great emotion: "Now China has not been openly destroyed, but it has already been secretly destroyed." Chiang Kai-shek's fight in the civil war will definitely fail. Not to mention anything else, just look at where the people's hearts are. Victory can be achieved when the people's hearts are attached. During this Longhai Line battle, tens of thousands of ordinary people went to the front line, and their enthusiasm was so high that I had never seen it in my many years of military life. If it were the Central Army, they would have to be tied up with ropes, otherwise they would all run away. The Eighth Route Army will surely win, and Chiang Kai-shek will surely fail. Everyone can see through it, so everyone laid down their weapons as soon as they made contact in this battle. If all the officers and soldiers know that the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners of war well and does not kill prisoners, then even more people will lay down their weapons in future wars..." Before leaving, he suggested staying to work in the Eighth Route Army. He said, "In the past ten years or so, I have traveled many roads. This time, the Eighth Route Army saved us from the road to death. I am willing to work in the Eighth Route Army to serve the country." I told him to study hard, that the door of revolution is wide open, and that it will never reject any sincere revolutionary friend. Then we parted in a farewell.

### 八路军救活了我们！——陇海前线通讯

　　八路军救活了我们！
    ——陇海前线通讯
    八月十九日，我在荷泽城附近的一个乡村里，访问了几位在兰封及柳河车站放下武器的西北军军官。一位是五十五师七四旅二二○团三营九连排长张云生君、一位是八连连长王国兴君、还有一位是五五师七四旅八六团四连连长刘治国君。
    我正在阅读一张中国时报，上面写着：“中央社南京三十日电：‘政府军’复员整编工作正在继续进行中，……前曾有何成浚将军自请退役，此次复有上将冯玉祥、万福麟、鹿钟麟、李济琛等十五人，中将段樽华等二百一十七人，少将刘炳寰等五百七十六人，共八百零八人，连同中下级干部达一万四千余人。”我被这个消息吸引住了。这时张云生君来了，他听了这个消息，脸上现出了一种阴沉表情，他低头沉默了好久，不禁慨然叹息，他说：“这个名单中一部分是西北军的，但也有一部分是东北军的将领，如万福麟等。但他们的命运都是一样的，现在都逐渐的被国民党蒋介石消灭了。
    “我们西北军过去侥幸没被完全消灭，是因为还有个冯玉祥在。弟兄们都说：‘只要冯玉祥将军有饭吃，西北军就还能有碗饭吃’。他要一走，大家也就完了”。
    “西北军都不满意老蒋，但谁也不敢说出口来，老蒋的嫡系部队不断扩充，享福的是他们，受罪的是咱西北军。打仗时把西北军放在前面打冲锋，发军服时蒋介石的军官是很漂亮的斜纹布制服，西北军穿的是粗布衣服。西北军的枪都是破旧的湖北造，而胡宗南部队却是清一色的最新式的美式武器………”他的声音越来越高，而且显出了悲愤的情绪：“蒋介石对西北军采取的是逐渐消灭的办法，由大编小，由小编无，曹福林由五五军改编成五五师，二十九师改编成二十九旅，七四师改编成七四旅，一八一师改编成一八一旅，光九十九军就编掉三个团的干部，全数在一千人以上。被编余的因为要打内战，三分之一到军官总队，三分之二有的回家，有的在陇海路沿线作占买卖，有很多年老和残废的军官，带着一大群妻子儿女欲归不得，流浪街头，生活是很凄惨的。这就是西北军军官的下场，大家看了能不寒心吗？大家的希望是什么时候编完，早些遣散也就算了。现在所以还不很快编完，主要是还可以利用西北军来打内战，替蒋介石当炮灰，一到蒋介石看到用不着了，也就可以一脚踢开了”。
    说到这里，他深沉的出了一口气，眼睛里被一层泪水所蒙住了。他自入伍以来，已过了十三年的军队生活，从胶东的胶县，济＠，由济＠到九江、荆门、中襄、南阳、唐县……，抗胜战利后才转到许昌、考城、兰封。
    刘治国和王国兴连长也来了，他们也同样说出了西北军在蒋介石统治下没有前途的话。刘君说：“编掉的一部分军官都欢天喜地，因为可以回家了。但是蒋介石又不让回家，强迫进军官总队。在杨成的部队中，每连都有蒋介石派来的指导员，都是在军校毕业后又到政训团受过特务训练的。专门考查部队官兵的思想行动和私人情形，每周有一个报告送到政治部去。连里官兵对他们很讨厌，叫他们是卖狗皮膏药的。现在西北军就只有曹福林这一个师了，目前只剩下了三个旅（四个团），每团二千七百多人。另有米文扣的一八一师，也不过六千人左右，这次曹福林参加内战，被消灭了四千多人，二十九师也被消灭了一部分。
    西北军的军官都不愿打内战，他们都说：“我们自己打自己人干什么？我在这里，我的哥哥兄弟都在八路军，这不是自己打自己的兄弟吗？过去我们抗战打日本牺牲流血是光荣的。现在因为蒋介石卖国打内战，流了血多么不值的呀！”在此内战爆发后，士兵们听说与八路军打仗，就纷纷逃亡了。我在柳河东站战斗时，指导员和副连长都突围了，我带了一个排没有打，全部人枪一个也不少，我们放下了武器。蒋介石一心想打内战，人人干着痛心，请假不准，逃跑又不可能，所以趁这机会放下武器了。
    “蒋介石的卖国内战我们是看的很清的，美国帮助蒋介石的飞机大炮，一定有他的条件，蒋介石要美国人的东西，美国反动分子就要我们的国家。现在我们的国家已经被美国控制了。”从很久的沉默中，王国兴君很感慨的说：“现在中国明的没亡，暗的早已经亡了”。蒋介石的打内战一定要失败，别的不说，只看人心背向就知道了。民心归顺就能胜利，这次陇海线战事老百姓成千成万上前线，情绪那样高，是我多年来的军队生活中没看到的。要是中央军就得上绳子，不然就都跑了。八路军一定要胜利，蒋介石一定要失败，人人都看透了，所以这次打仗一接触就都放下了武器。要是所有的官兵都知道八路军优待俘虏，不杀俘虏，以后的战争中放下武器的就更多了……。”临走的时候，他提出意见，希望留在八路军工作，他说：“从过去十多年中我走了许多路，这一次八路军从死路上救活了我们，我愿意在八路军工作来报效国家。”我告诉他好好的学习，革命的门是大开的，决不会拒绝任何一个真诚革命的朋友，于是我们在再见声中分手了。
