　　Intentionally Provoking Civil War, Reckless and Unscrupulous!
    The Kuomintang Offers High Positions and Generous Salaries to Employ Japanese Bandits Who Slaughtered Compatriots
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th] In the self-defense counterattacks of the past few months, the Eighth Route Army in various places has captured a large number of Japanese soldiers from the Kuomintang army. Most of these Japanese soldiers have been promoted by the Chiang Kai-shek side according to their original ranks and given generous treatment. They have also changed their names and married Chinese women, preparing to slaughter the Chinese people for a long time. In Shanxi, Yan Xishan once reorganized the Japanese army into eight special agent regiments and columns, stationed in various parts of Shanxi. According to Japanese soldiers Kawabin and Matsuzo, who fled to the liberated areas from Taiyuan, Yan Xishan reorganized 2,000 Japanese into a road protection column, under which there were three battalions, 4, 5, and 6, each with 400 men, including a mountain artillery heavy machine gun company. In June, they were combined with five engineering battalions stationed in Wutai and other places to form a "Guard Regiment," under the overall responsibility of Japanese army Lieutenant General Motoyasu Kaoru, equipped with armored vehicles. They wear the old Japanese army short-style uniforms and leather shoes that were preserved, but the Chinese army caps on their heads are embroidered with the blue sky and white sun emblem. In order to lure Japanese prisoners into participating in the civil war, Yan Xishan not only promoted them by three ranks and increased their salaries (45,000 yuan per month for a second lieutenant, 90,000 yuan for a major, and 120,000 yuan for a major general) and gave them a good life, but also married Chinese wives for the Japanese soldiers. Japanese soldier Shigeta married Jie Cuihua, a 17-year-old from Daixian city this year. Japanese soldier Sato Zuo Nan, a sergeant in the communications agency of the 4th Division and 2nd Regiment of the Yan Army, married Jin Lian from Shili Village, Daixian County. In Suiyuan, in Fu Zuoyi's tank team, each tank is driven by a Japanese. Furthermore, he colludes with the Japanese to form special agent agencies, and sends a large number of special agents to the liberated areas to carry out assassinations, robberies, and conspiracies. In the Wenzu self-defense battle in Nanzhibu Village, Zhangqiu, Shandong, many officers and soldiers of the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 15th Division of the 96th Army of the Chiang Kai-shek army were captured, and 13 Japanese soldiers were found among them. Most of them were promoted according to their original ranks and ordered to use Chinese names to serve as tank drivers and light and heavy artillerymen. When the Northeast Democratic Allied Army and the Kuomintang authorities agreed to repatriate prisoners and overseas Chinese, the Democratic Allied Army actively carried out the repatriation work in accordance with the agreement, and successively repatriated approximately 80,000 Japanese overseas Chinese and prisoners of war. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang authorities left all Japanese overseas Chinese and prisoners of war between the ages of 18 and 48 sent to Shenyang by the liberated areas, and formed a 5,000-man armed force in Shenyang for attacking the liberated areas. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries colluded with the Japanese troops of Itto, Yoshioka, Kamimura, and others in northern Manchuria, as well as bandits, puppet troops, and Japanese officers Sasaki Yoshizo, Yamauchi Yoshio, and others from Harbin, and more than 1,800 Japanese troops to plot a riot. This case has been solved by the Binjiang government authorities in Harbin, and many certificates have been obtained.
