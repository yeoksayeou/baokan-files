　　[Changzhi Dispatch, September 17th] A section of workers in Huolu, cooperating with small armed units, have launched a propaganda war in the KMT-controlled areas. Local people have been complaining to our workers about the crimes of the stubborn reactionaries and puppets, requesting their liberation. When we posted propaganda materials in ×× village, the masses lit lamps to read them, and those who could not read listened to others read aloud. The common people said to our workers: "The Central Army is worse than the Japanese. Look at the pillboxes and trenches now, more than when the Japanese were here, and they take more things from us than the Japanese did. When the Japanese were here, they didn't make the common people train all day long. Now the Kuomintang won't let the common people work the land, but makes them train all day long." A wealthy household surnamed Hu said: "The Central Army will bleed the common people dry. The autumn harvest hasn't even been gathered yet, and they already want more than ten catties per mu." When our workers asked in return: "Didn't the Kuomintang say there would be no burdens for three years and no conscription for two years?" the masses all pointed to the posters on the wall and said: "Look, the government's notices are still posted there! Their (referring to the Kuomintang) words aren't even worth a fart." An old man met our worker on the road, asked the purpose of his visit, and hurriedly invited him home to cook a meal. After repeated refusals, the old man said with melancholy: "This place is truly unlivable. Now they want to build an airport in Daguocun, and they have to cut down the nearly ripe crops. The common people begged the county magistrate (stubborn reactionary puppet county magistrate) to let them harvest after autumn. He said: 'Politics can't control the military.' The Central Army officer replied: 'We must govern the country first before we can govern the family.' He cursed them, and the villagers had no choice but to cry all the way back." The local people are all asking our workers to "rescue them quickly."
    [Weixian Dispatch, September 17th] The military region's No. 2 Ordnance Factory launched a production competition to support the front lines. The projectile group of fourteen people, in addition to regularly drawing some people to repair houses, completed more than 3,000 projectiles in four days. Each person can make 25 molds per day, an increase of two to three times compared to before. Each person in the turning group can turn more than 100 pieces per day. Each person in the primer group can make more than 1,000 detonators per day. Yan Keqin alone made more than 1,000 fuses in one day. Now all the workers in the factory are carefully studying how to further increase production.

　　获鹿工作人员深入蒋区宣传
    人民痛诉忧怨盼我解救
    冀南炸弹二所展开支援增产
    【本报长治十七日电】获鹿以一部工作人员配合小型武装向蒋管区展开宣传战，当地群众纷纷向我工作人员控诉顽伪的罪恶，要求解救他们。我们将宣传品贴到××村时，群众点上灯看，不识字的听别人念。老百姓对我们的工作员说：“中央军比日本人还不是人，你看现在的炮楼和沟比日本人在时多，东西也比日本人要的多。日本人在时，没有叫老百姓整天受训，现在国民党不让老百姓上地，整天受训。”一个姓胡的富户说：“中央军非把老百姓刮干不行，现在秋粮没打下来，每亩地已经要十斤以上了。”当我工作员反问：“国民党不是说三年不出负担，二年不出兵吗？”群众都指着墙上说：“你看政府的布告还贴着哩！他们（指国民党）说话还不如放屁。”一个老头子在半路上碰上我工作员，问讯了来意，急忙召到家里给做饭吃。经再三谢绝后，该老翁忧郁的说：“这地方真不能活了。现在人家又要在大郭村修飞机场，把快熟的庄稼非都割掉不行。老百姓向县长（顽伪县长）央求过了秋天再割。人家说：‘政治管不了军事。’中央军官回答是：‘先治国，才能治家。’大骂一顿，乡亲们没有办法，一路哭着回来。”当地老百姓都纷纷要求我工作员“赶快救救他们”。
    【本报威县十七日电】军区炸弹二所展开支援前线的生产竞赛，弹头组十四人除了经常抽出几个人修理房子，在四天内完成三千多弹头。每天每人能打模子二十五个，较前增加二倍到三倍。旋把组每人每天能旋一百多个。底火组每人每日可造千余雷管。阎克勤一个人一天就造一千多导火索。现在全所工人正精心研究如何进一步提高产量。
