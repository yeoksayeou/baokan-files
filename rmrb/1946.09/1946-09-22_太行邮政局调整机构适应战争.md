　　Taihang Postal Bureau Adjusts Organization to Adapt to War
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang Postal Administration recently called on all postal workers in the area to fully support the front lines, stating briefly: Everything is for the victory of self-defense. We must strive to deliver public documents, letters, and newspapers quickly and accurately at every moment, so that the front and rear are connected in a timely manner, and strive for an early victory in the patriotic self-defense war. The bureau is now working to rectify the organizational structure at all levels and adjust personnel to suit the war situation. It also instructed the bureaus and stations in the border areas to be prepared for the arrival of war at any time, to flexibly organize wartime communication, and to achieve "no chaos, no disruption" during wartime.
