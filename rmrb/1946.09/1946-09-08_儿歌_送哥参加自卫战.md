　　Children's Song
  　Seeing Brother off to Join the Self-Defense War
    Cai Mu
    The rooster crows at midnight,
    My sister-in-law and I get up before dawn.
    Brother is going to join the war tomorrow,
    So we hurry to make him some pancakes.
　
    Sister-in-law chops scallions,
    I mix the dough.
    The scallions are chopped as fine as needles, five fen long,
    The dough is mixed soft and pliable to the touch.
　
    I pump the bellows,
    The fire in the stove laughs.
    Fire, oh fire, you've guessed wrong,
    There are no guests coming now, we're seeing our brother off...
　
    The pancakes are made thin,
    The pancakes are made round,
    The pancakes are browned on both sides,
    So our brother can eat them and enjoy them.
　
    The pancakes are made with a thousand layers,
    Filled with sesame salt.
    A thousand layers in a thousand-layer pancake, a thousand layers of heart,
    When I grow up, I'll join the Eighth Route Army...

  　送哥参加自卫战
    蔡牧
    半夜公鸡喔喔啼
    我和嫂嫂起五更
    哥哥明儿去参战
    赶早给他烙几张饼
　
    嫂嫂切葱花
    我把面来和
    葱花切得针细五分长
    面儿和得软柔耐手摸
　
    我来拉风箱
    灶心火发笑
    火呀火呀你猜错了
    这会儿没客来，是咱送哥哥……
　
    饼儿烙得薄
    饼儿烙得圆
    饼儿烙得两面黄
    包俺哥哥吃来香
　
    饼儿烙成千层空
    里面包上芝麻盐
    千层饼里千层心
    长大我去参加八路军……
