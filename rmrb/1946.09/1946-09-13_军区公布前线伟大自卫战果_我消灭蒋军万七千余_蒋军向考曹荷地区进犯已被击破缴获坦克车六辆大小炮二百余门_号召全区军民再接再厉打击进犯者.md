　　Military Region Announces Great Victory in Frontline Self-Defense
    We Eliminated Over 17,000 Chiang Troops
    Chiang Troops' Advance on Kao-Tsao-He Area Repulsed, Six Tanks and Over Two Hundred Guns of Various Sizes Captured
    Calls on the Military and Civilians of the Entire Region to Continue Efforts to Strike at the Invaders
    [This newspaper, Handan, 10th] From September 3rd to 8th, our army achieved a great victory in the area west of Dingtao on the Longhai Railway, annihilating two armies and four divisions of Chiang's troops. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued a formal communique stating: When the 181st Division and one regiment of the 19th Division were wiped out in the Longhai Self-Defense Counter-offensive, we warned the Kuomintang reactionary authorities to wake up early and quickly stop their offensive against our liberated areas. However, Chiang Kai-shek not only did not stop the offensive, but instead mobilized large armies from southern Shaanxi, western Henan, and western Hubei, and continued to advance from Changyuan, Kaocheng, Lanfeng, Minquan, and Shangqiu towards our liberated areas north of the Longhai Railway. He also sent Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng to Zhengzhou and Bianliang to make deployments, and Liu Zhi, director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, personally commanded the front line in Kaocheng and Minquan, urging his reorganized 3rd Division (formerly the 10th Army), 47th Division (formerly the 47th Army), 41st Division (formerly the 41st Army), Liu Ruming's 119th Division, the 74th Division, remnants of the 181st Division, Zhang Lanfeng's Provisional 4th Column, and parts of the 88th Army, 65th Army, and 18th Army (renamed as a division), totaling about fifteen divisions (brigades). On one hand, they attacked our Dongming east of Kaocheng, and Dingtao and Caoxian south of Heze, and occupied our city of Caoxian; on the other hand, they invaded six county towns north of the Longhai Railway, including Shanxian, Chengwu, Yucheng, Fengxian, Peixian, and Yutai. Wherever they went, they burned, killed, looted, and did everything possible, vowing to kill all the people in the liberated areas and bloodbath the peaceful villages and cities of the liberated areas. Our military and civilians in the liberated areas had no choice but to continue to resolutely counterattack. The fighting began on August 23rd and ended on September 8th. Among them, the five-day battle from September 3rd to 8th was the most intense. The Chiang troops used almost all of their available American-made firearms, with mountain guns bombarding day and night, tanks charging continuously, and bombers and aerial fortresses taking off all day to bomb indiscriminately everywhere. Large amounts of American-made ammunition were continuously transported to the front lines by air and land. However, under the oath of our liberated area military and civilians to defend the liberated areas and their heroic and tenacious counterattacks, they still could not save their disastrous defeat. In the battles from September 3rd to 6th, their entire reorganized 3rd Division (formerly the 10th Army) was annihilated by us first, and all officers and soldiers below the division commander (formerly the 10th Army commander) Zhao Xitian were either captured or killed and wounded by us. Although their 41st Division, 29th Division, and 74th Division desperately reinforced from the two wings of the 3rd Division and attacked us fiercely, they also suffered a disastrous defeat under our resolute counterattacks. The 47th Division, following the annihilation of the 3rd Division, was also completely annihilated by us (only a few escaped). The 41st Division, 68th Division, 55th Division (all originally armies later renamed as divisions), and other units were partially annihilated by us in their retreat. By this point, the Chiang troops who were attacking our Kaocheng, Caoxian, and Heze areas north of the Longhai Railway were completely defeated, and Chiang's troops' offensive against our liberated areas was smashed once again. Combining the results of the eighteen-day battle, a total of two armies (divisions) and more than four divisions (brigades) were annihilated (together with the two divisions annihilated along the Longhai Railway, a total of six divisions of Chiang's troops were annihilated), and more than 5,000 invading troops, including brigade commander Tan Naida of the 20th Brigade, regimental commander of the 58th Regiment, and regimental commander of the 59th Regiment, were killed and wounded. Division commander Zhao Xitian of the reorganized 3rd Division, regimental commander Wu Yaodong, deputy regimental commander Sun Huayu, and more than 12,200 officers and soldiers laid down their weapons. We captured six tanks, more than two hundred guns of various sizes, more than 4,300 rifles, 712 light and heavy machine guns, 14 cars, 15 radio stations, and countless other military equipment. Finally, the communique called on the military and civilians of the entire region to jointly celebrate these two major victories achieved through the cooperation of the army and the people. The military and civilians of the entire region should especially be vigilant that the enemy is still strong and is currently deploying new offensives. We can only continue to strengthen our own forces and eliminate more enemies in order to teach those warmongering and traitorous elements a lesson and achieve independence, peace, and democracy.

　　军区公布前线伟大自卫战果
    我消灭蒋军万七千余
    蒋军向考曹荷地区进犯已被击破缴获坦克车六辆大小炮二百余门
    号召全区军民再接再厉打击进犯者
    【本报邯郸十日电】九月三日到八日，我军在陇海路定陶以西地区，取得了消灭蒋军两个军四个师的伟大胜利，顷由晋冀鲁豫军区发布正式公报称：在陇海自卫反击战，一八一师及十九师一个团被消灭时，我们就曾经警告过国民党反动当局及早觉悟，迅速停止对我解放区的进攻。但蒋介石不但不停止进攻，反而更从陕南、豫西、鄂西诸地调动大军，从长垣、考城、兰封、民权、商邱向我陇海路北解放区继续进犯，并派白崇禧、陈诚亲赴郑、汴部署，郑州绥署主任刘峙亲临考城、民权前线指挥，督促其整三师（原第十军）、第四十七师（原四十七军）、第四十一师（原四十一军）、刘汝明之一一九师、七十四师、一八一师残部，张岚峰暂编第四纵队及第八十八军、六十五军、第十八军（改称师）各一部，共约十五个师（旅）的兵力，一面向我考城以东东明、荷泽以南定陶、曹县地区进攻，并占我曹县城；一面侵占我陇海路北之单县、城武、虞城、丰县、沛县、鱼台等六个县城。足迹所至，烧杀劫掠，无所不用其极，扬言要杀尽一切解放区人民，血洗解放区和平乡村与城市，我解放区军民不得已继续坚决予以反击，战斗自八月二十三日开始，至九月八日结束。其中以九月三日至八日的五日战斗最为剧烈，蒋军几乎将其应有尽有的全套美制火器都用上了，山炮日夜轰击，坦克不断猛冲，轰炸机及空中堡垒竟日出动到处滥炸，大部美造弹药不断由空陆运送前线。但在我解放区军民誓死保卫解放区和英勇顽强的反击下，仍然不能挽救他的惨败。三日至六日战斗中，其整三师（原第十军）全部，首先为我歼灭，师长（原十军军长）赵锡田以下官兵全部为我俘获或毙伤。其四十一师、二十九师、七十四师虽拚死从第三师的两翼增援猛烈向我攻击，但在我坚决反击下，一样遭到惨败。四十七师紧随第三师消灭之后，亦全部被我歼灭（仅少数逃出）。四十一师、六十八师、五十五师（原均为军后改称师）等部在溃退中，各被我歼灭一部。至此，向我陇海路北考城、曹县、荷泽地区进攻之蒋军，全线被我击破，又一次粉碎了蒋军对我解放区的进攻。综合十八日来战斗结果，共计消灭两个军（师）四个师（旅）以上（连同陇海沿线消灭之两个师，则共消灭蒋军六个师之众），毙伤进犯军二十旅旅长谭乃达、五十八团团长、五十九团团长等以下五千余人。整三师师长赵锡田、团长吴耀东及副团长孙化雨等以下官兵一万二千二百余人放下武器。我缴获坦克六辆、大小炮二百余门，长短枪四千三百余支，轻重机枪七百一十二挺，汽车十四辆，电台十五部，其他军用器材无算。最后，公报中号召全区军民一致庆祝这两次由军队与人民合作而获得的重大胜利，全区军民尤应警惕敌人仍然强大，现正部署新的进攻，我们只有继续壮大自己的力量，更多的消灭敌人，才能教训那些好战卖国分子，求得独立和平民主的实现。
