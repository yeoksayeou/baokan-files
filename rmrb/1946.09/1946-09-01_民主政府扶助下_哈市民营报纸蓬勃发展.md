　　Democratic Government Support
    Harbin's Private Newspapers Flourish

    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th] Harbin currently has seven Chinese-language newspapers: Northeast Daily, Li Bao, Minsheng Daily, Dazhong Daily, Wu Bao, Songjiang Business Daily, and Democratic Daily, as well as one newspaper each in Russian, Polish, Japanese, and Korean. Among the seven Chinese-language newspapers, only Northeast Daily is the organ of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party; the rest are private enterprises independently operated by local democratic figures, gentry, merchants, or professional journalists. According to those familiar with the Harbin newspaper industry: Before the "September 18th" Incident, there were at most fourteen Chinese-language newspapers run by Chinese people in the city. After the Japanese invaders invaded, they were repeatedly devastated. Within a year, only four remained, barely surviving. After 1937, "Li Bao" among the four was forcibly bought by the Japanese invaders (now republished), and the remaining three were forced to merge into the Binjiang Daily. News workers fled one after another. After "August 15th," Kuomintang receiving officials applied their news control policies in the Northeast, causing local news workers to feel disappointed. Until the Democratic Allied Forces entered Harbin and the local democratic government was established, the people gained freedom of speech and publication, and the private news industry received multifaceted support, also showing a flourishing atmosphere. It is expected that soon after, Harbin's newspapers will have new developments.

　　民主政府扶助下
    哈市民营报纸蓬勃发展
    【新华社哈尔滨二十九日电】哈尔滨全市现有东北日报、力报、民生日报、大众日报、午报、松江商报、民主日报等中文报纸七家，俄、波、日、鲜文报纸各一家。在七家中文报纸中，仅东北日报为中共东北中央局机关报纸，余均为当地民主人士绅商或职业记者所独立经营之私人企业。据熟悉哈市报业者称：“九一八”前，本市国人经营之中文报纸最多时曾有十四家，日寇侵入后，迭遭摧残，一年之内即仅剩四家勉强维持。三七年后，四家中之“力报”又被日寇强迫收买（现已复刊），其余三家被迫并为滨江日报，新闻工作者均纷纷逃亡。“八一五”后，国民党接收大员援用其新闻统制政策于关外，致使当地新闻工作者感到失望，迄民主联军进驻哈市及当地民主政权建立后，人民获得言论出版的自由，民营新闻事业获得多方扶助，亦呈蓬勃发展气象，预料不久之后，哈市报纸将有新发展。
