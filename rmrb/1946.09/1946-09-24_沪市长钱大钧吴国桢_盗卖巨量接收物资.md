Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai dispatch: Recently, a huge corruption case involving two Kuomintang Shanghai mayors, Qian Dajun and Wu Guozhen, who successively stole and sold a total of 4.2 billion yuan worth of seized materials, has been uncovered here. The case was exposed by a former city government employee who knew the inside story, and he listed various pieces of evidence. Wu Guozhen had no choice but to admit to reporters on the 3rd that Qian Dajun had sold 3.1 billion yuan worth of materials, and he subsequently sold 1.1 billion yuan, but he disguised it as being used for rice loans for public school teachers and staff, and claimed that he had obtained Chiang Kai-shek's approval. According to the Enemy and Puppet Assets Investigation Team of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region, after reviewing the files for days, there are no such supporting documents. The case is still at a standstill, but the investigation team left Shanghai for Hangzhou on the 9th.

　　沪市长钱大钧吴国桢
    盗卖巨量接收物资
    【新华社延安二十日电】沪讯：近日此间发现国民党上海市政府两届市长钱大钧、吴国桢，先后共盗卖四十二亿元接收物资之巨大舞币案。该案系由洞悉内幕之前市府职员所揭发，并历举种种证明，吴国桢不得不于三日向各报记者承认系钱大钧变卖三十一亿元，渠继后变卖十一亿元，但以用作公教人员米贷金为掩饰，且谓曾得蒋介石批准。据苏浙皖区敌伪物资清查团连日翻阅卷宗，并无此项证明文件，此案尚无头绪，但该清查团已于九日离沪去杭。
