　　"With the Communist Party Comes Good Times"
    ——A Record of Seventeen Liberated Brothers
    Shi Hong
    At nine o'clock in the morning, the symposium of seventeen liberated brothers outside Shagoumen began. Everyone was smiling, and the shadow of suffering had disappeared from their faces.
    Comrade Li Dingxiang, the street leader, spoke first. He said, "This year's festival is completely different from previous years. In the past, I carried manure for others, worrying about food and drink. Now I have bought mooncakes and cut meat, and I am happy beyond words." He is one of the most trusted mass leaders in the city, currently serving as a county councilor, a standing committee member of the county district trade union, and chairman of the street manure collectors' committee.
    Wang Xinjing, a white-haired 63-year-old man, used to have no way out and sold his two beloved sons to the Granny Temple and sent his wife to the Catholic Church to raise children for others. He said, "Since I was a child, I have been picking up and selling manure on the streets, and at night I also contracted to irrigate gardens for others. I couldn't even take care of my life and death, and I also half-cultivated more than twenty mu of land." Speaking of "the Eighth Route Army entering the city," a smile appeared on his wrinkled face: "I got my land back, bought a donkey, and also received 15,400 yuan in fruit, my life has been completely turned over, and I supported the civilian association with 8,000 yuan. This year for the festival, I will have something to eat."
    These people are mostly from manure collector backgrounds and were almost all liberated at the same time. As soon as Old Man Wang stopped speaking, a man named Liu De started talking. He is from Shahe Shigang. He said, "My family was so poor that there was no way out. I had a fortune told, and the fortune teller said that my fate was poor and that moving to another place would be better. So I went to Wu'an to pick up and sell manure, but who knew it was even worse. The landlord said: This is your poor fate. Bullshit! Fate, the Eighth Route Army came, and my fate was turned over. I had my rent reduced, my fruit divided, and I also have a good house and a donkey."
    How could this not excite them? How could they bear to forget these epoch-making years?
    When Han Cheng led his wife and four children from his hometown to Wu'an, he only had two carrying poles and a quilt. Now he has more than ten mu of land and more than ten good houses, "two older children married two daughters-in-law, the third child works as a shop assistant, and the fourth child also goes to school." He said, "I have never cut meat for the New Year or festivals. This year I cut two catties of thick meat."
    People cherish today's good times, so they are determined to defend them with all their strength. Militia Captain Miao He'de, who just returned from the Anyang front, said, "These good times were brought about by the Communist Party. If the Kuomintang attacks again, I will go again, and fight until victory." Militiamen Wang Xifang and Guo Erchun also said, "We must do it, otherwise our liberation will not be guaranteed."
    The 63-year-old man listened to the young people and said with trembling lips: "You are all young, be active members and models at the front. I am old, I will be a backward member. ......" Why should a liberated old hero be a backward member in the patriotic self-defense war? Before everyone could ask him, the old man said again: "My backwardness is different from the backwardness in the struggle. I can't go to the front to fight, so I will cook for the militiamen fighting at the front." Everyone "roared" with laughter. The old man's words were really interesting.
    The clock on the table struck twelve o'clock, and the whistle for all 210 civilian households in the street to drink seafood soup from the same pot also sounded. They happily took out a letter and asked the reporter to "send it to Chairman Mao and ask him how he is doing." It read: Chairman Mao, the just and righteous leader:
    We are endlessly grateful since the Eighth Route Army you led rescued us from the enemy's rule. Afterwards, you led us to turn over and eradicate poverty, and now your ideal has been realized. We have land, and our lives are good! You don't have to worry anymore!
    Now that our lives are good, the stubborn egg, Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, is unhappy and wants us to live that life of little to eat and nothing to drink. Tell you, just and righteous leader, we all know that without the Communist Party, there would be no good times. During this Mid-Autumn Festival, in addition to asking how you are doing, we also swear to you that we will definitely follow you and overthrow those traitorous diehards. We know very clearly that none of your words are not for eliminating harm and bringing benefits to the people.
    Wish you longevity!
    Respectfully kowtowed by all the liberated people of Shagoumen Street

　　“有共产党就有时光”
    ——记十七位翻身弟兄
    史洪
    上午九时，沙沟门外十七位翻身弟兄的座谈会开始了。人们都笑眯眯的，痛苦的影子已从他们脸上消失了。
    街长李定祥同志首先说话了，他说：“今年过节和往年根本不同，以前我给人担粪，愁吃愁喝，现今买了月饼割了肉，高兴的没法儿啦。”他是城里人民最信仰的群众领袖之一，现任县参议员、县区工会常委、街粪夫委员会主席。
    白发苍苍六十三岁的王新景老汉，过去因走头无路把两个爱子卖给奶奶庙，把老婆送给天主堂给人家养孩子，他说：“我从小就在街上拾粪卖粪，晚上又给人包灌园子，生死还顾不住，又给人半种了二十多亩地。”说到“八路军进城”以后，皱纹垒垒的脸上又浮出了笑容：“我倒回了地，买了驴，还分了一万五千四百块钱的果实，我的身翻透啦，就维护了平民会八千块。今年过节，要吃有吃”。
    这些人多是粪夫出身，差不多是同时翻身的，王老汉一住嘴，有个叫刘德的就说起来，他是沙河石岗人，他说：“我家穷的没办法，算了一卦，先生说是命穷，挪挪地方就好啦，我就到武安拾粪卖粪，谁知道更没办法，人家老财又说：这是你命穷。屁！命，八路军来了，我的命翻身啦，倒了租，分了果实，又有了好房子，还有一条驴。”
    这些怎能不使他们兴奋呢，他们怎么能舍得忘去这划时代的年月呢。
    韩成的从故乡领着老婆和四个孩子到武安时，只有两条扁担一条被子，现在他已有了十来亩地，十来间好房子，“两个大孩子娶了两个媳妇，老三给人作店员，老四也上了学堂”。他说：“我过年过节都没割过肉，今年我割了一寸多厚的二斤大肉。”
    人们珍爱今天的好时光，因此就有决心拼着一切力量保卫他，民兵队长苗黑的，才从安阳前线回来，他说：“这时光是共产党给带了来的，要是国民党再来进攻，我还要去，一直打到胜利为止。”民兵王喜方、郭二春也说，“非干不行，不然咱这身翻的就不保险”。
    六十三岁的老汉听了年轻人的话，颤动着嘴唇又说起来：“你们都年轻，在前面当个积极分子、模范人，我年纪大，当个落后分子。……………翻身老英雄为什么要在爱国自卫战争中当落后分子呢？大家还未来得及问他，老汉又说起来了：“我这落后可和斗争中的落后不一样，我不能到前面去打仗，我就给在前面打仗的民兵做饭。”大家“哄”的一声笑了，老汉的话真有意思。
    桌上的钟敲了十二点，全街二百一十户平民会在同一锅里喝海味汤的哨声也叫起来。他们高高兴兴的拿出一封信，请记者“给毛主席打了去，问问他好”。上面写道：毛主席青天大人：
    自你领导的八路军把我们从敌人统治下救出来以后，我们就感恩不尽啦，以后又领导我们翻身拔穷根，现在你的理想实现啦。我们有了地啦，生活过好啦！你也不用挂心啦！
    我们生活过好啦，国民党蒋介石这顽固蛋就不乐意，还想让我们过那少吃无喝的生活。告你吧，青天大人，我们都知道，离开共产党就没了时光，我们在这中秋节的时候，除过问候你好，并向你宣誓，我们一定跟你走，打倒那些汉奸顽固，我们清清楚楚的知道，你的话没有一样不是为民除害、为民兴利的。
    祝你   万岁！
    沙门口街全体翻身人民敬叩
