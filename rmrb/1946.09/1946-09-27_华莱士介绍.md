　　Introduction to Wallace
    Wallace is a relatively enlightened figure in the American Democratic Party. After Roosevelt became president in 1933, he served as Secretary of Agriculture for eight years. During his tenure, he drafted the "Agricultural Plan," which greatly benefited farmers. After 1940, he was elected Vice President, serving as President of the Senate and concurrently as Director of the Economic Warfare Bureau. In the 1944 election, Roosevelt, in order to reconcile the contradictions within the Democratic Party, reluctantly abandoned Wallace as the vice-presidential candidate. According to Time magazine, Roosevelt shed tears over this matter.

    He advocates democracy, and he believes that people should have freedom of rights, especially the freedom from want among the Four Freedoms advocated by Roosevelt.

    He advocates cooperation with the Soviet Union. When he visited the Soviet Union the year before last, he gave a speech while passing through Siberia, praising the greatness of the Soviet Union's construction achievements. He also proposed establishing a route between Chicago and Moscow when Molotov visited the United States last year to strengthen ties between the two countries. He sent experts from his Department of Commerce to the Soviet Union to study ways to increase US-Soviet trade.

    On Double Ten Day last year, he said, "China, through internal cooperation, will play a great role in the Asian world." He advocates Sino-American-British-Soviet cooperation, saying that "the United States and all democratic countries hope for a prosperous and democratic China." During his visit to Chongqing in June the year before last, he expressed confidence in the strength of the Chinese people and praised the heroic resistance of our guerrillas.

    He also advocates autonomy for Far Eastern colonies, believing that this is the best way to maintain peace.

    Economically, he opposes monopoly capital, and he strongly supports small and medium-sized enterprises. After taking office as Secretary of Commerce on March 1 last year, he stated that he would establish a planning committee for small-scale businesses to seek full employment of "sixty million jobs" after the war. For African Americans who are abused and discriminated against, he advocates fair employment treatment.

    He opposes the control of atomic bombs by the American military and supports international control of atomic bombs.

    For the reactionary members within the Democratic Party, he advocates expelling them from the party and depriving them of their qualifications as candidates. Because his views are relatively enlightened, he has gained the support of American progressive groups and African Americans. Before the 1944 election, the Political Action Committee called for the election of Roosevelt and Wallace and guaranteed "full support for Wallace."

    However, Wallace still harbors illusions about the so-called free enterprise capitalist system in the United States. He once said, "If capitalism cannot guarantee everyone two quarts of milk, I will not believe in it." However, he is very afraid of the arrival of the kind of depression and poverty of 1929-1932, which is inevitable. At the same time, until recently, he still had illusions about Truman and the Democratic Party. He has never directly criticized the Truman government's mistakes, although he often puts forward his own political and economic views.

    Wallace was born in 1888 in a prominent family in Iowa, one of the agricultural centers of the United States. After graduating from the state's agricultural college, he served as deputy editor of the "Wallace's Farmer" newspaper founded by his grandfather from 1910 to 1924, and then as editor-in-chief from 1924 to 1929. He is an agricultural expert, famous for hybridizing grains into new varieties, and has written books such as "Agricultural Value" and "Grains and Grain Growth."

　　华莱士介绍
    华莱士是美国民主党中比较开明的人物，自一九三三年罗斯福任总统后，即任农业部长达八年之久。在他任职期中，手订《农业计划》，对农民颇有裨益。一九四○年以后，他当选副总统，除当然为参院议长外，并兼任经济作战局长。一九四四年大选，罗斯福为调和民主党内的矛盾，忍痛放弃华莱士为副总统候选人，据时代周刊说：罗斯福曾为此事而下泪。
    他拥护民主，他主张人民应有自由权利，特别是罗斯福所主张的四大自由中免于匮乏的自由。
    他主张与苏联合作，前年他访问苏联，途次西伯利亚时，发表演说，盛赞苏联建设成就的伟大。他并于去年莫洛托夫访美时，提议建立芝加哥与莫斯科间的航路，以加强两国的联系。他曾派遣其商务部的专家赴苏研究增进美苏贸易方法。
    去年双十节，他说：“中国经过内部的合作，将在亚洲世界起伟大作用。”他主张中美英苏合作，“美国及一切民主国家都希望有一个繁荣民主的中国”，而在前年六月访问重庆时，他更对中国人民的力量表示信心，且盛赞我游击队的英勇抗战。
    他亦主张远东殖民地自治，认为这是维持和平的最好办法。
    在经济上，他反对垄断资本，他极力支持中小企业，去年三月一日，他就任商业部长后，表示决为小规模商业设立计划委员会，以谋战后充分就业“六千万个工作”。对于被虐待和歧视的美国黑人，他主张予以公平雇佣的待遇。
    他反对美国军人控制原子弹，而赞成国际共管原子弹。
    他对于民主党内反动的党员，主张开除出党，剥夺他们作为候选人的资格。由于他的主张比较开明，故获得美国进步团体及黑人的支持。在一九四四年大选前，政治行动委员会曾号召选举罗斯福与华莱士，并且保证“完全拥护华莱士”。
    不过，华莱士对于美国的所谓自由企业资本主义制度，却仍然抱着幻想，他曾说：“如果资本主义不能保证每人两夸特牛奶，我才不相信”；但他却非常害怕一九二九——三二年那种萧条与贫困的到来，而这是不可避免的会降临的。同时，他直到最近以前，仍对杜鲁门与民主党存有幻想，他从来没有直接批评过杜鲁门政府的错误，虽然时常提出自己的政治经济主张。
    华莱士于一八八八年生于美国农业中心之一伊阿华州的一个望族，在该州农业学院毕业后，于一九一○——二四年任乃祖所创《华莱士农民》报副主笔，一九二四年——二九年改任主笔。他是一个农业专家，以谷物杂交以成新种驰名，著有《农业价值》及《谷类与谷类生长》等书。
