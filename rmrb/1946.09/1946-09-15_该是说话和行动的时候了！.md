It's Time to Speak and Act!
    Liu Xiuzhen
    In my life, I have never been so active. For more than twenty years, I have been forced to numb myself with playing cards and smoking. The higher my position, the more distressed and afraid I felt. There was no right or wrong in the old society. I remember the wife of a certain army commander. When she flew from Beiping to Xi'an, she stopped in Shanghai to play. That day, Shanghai happened to have a performance by Mei Lanfang. Tickets were sold out several days in advance, but this lady bought a ticket for a million yuan, and also bought a pair of the latest shoes for eight hundred thousand yuan. When this lady arrived in Xi'an, she boasted about these two things everywhere and took pride in them. Others also marveled and spread the word. If you didn't approve of this kind of extravagance, then you were out of touch and not stylish enough. When people got together, they would talk about what was fashionable, what to wear! Otherwise, it was playing cards and watching movies, wasting time and money. Those who couldn't afford such extravagance had to stay at home. I think, even someone in my position couldn't "keep up with the trend," so you can imagine the situation of the families of our army's officers at all levels.
    After I came to the Liberated Area, I felt very comfortable everywhere. Although my living standards were lower, my spirit felt very happy. The people here live meaningfully and purposefully, and everyone is upward-looking and striving for progress. Under such influence, most of the families of our army have organized themselves. Now, seven units have established family schools, studying seriously and working happily every day. Ladies in their forties have also begun to learn to read, sing, and spin yarn. If this situation were in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, it would probably be ridiculed, but it is very natural here. Now, I also spend every day with everyone, guiding them in their studies and spinning yarn with them. My days are full and happy. Here, I have tasted the joy of collective life, the pleasure of labor, learning, and work. I feel the meaning of life.
    Now, I believe that anyone who comes to the Liberated Area, as long as they don't have deep-seated habits and prejudices, will make progress quickly. Anyone who is dissatisfied with the Kuomintang rule will definitely be satisfied with the Liberated Area. If all of China were like the Liberated Area, it would not be difficult for China to become strong. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries do not think about the country or the people. They rely on the assistance of American imperialist elements in everything, and use more than 80% of their forces to wage a civil war against the Liberated Area, violating the will of the people of the whole country, and brutally killing Li, Wen, and others who were working for peace and democracy. In order to achieve its goal of maintaining one-party dictatorship, the Kuomintang reactionary faction does not hesitate to give China's territory, territorial waters, airspace, and inland navigation rights to American imperialist elements, and also gives them the final decision-making power. Now, American goods are flooding the country, and American soldiers are rampant in major cities. Madame Sun said, "Every person with human feelings should speak out." Yes, I hope that our women compatriots will not sit idly by as this disaster approaches, and will use our voices and actions to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous acts of selling out the interests of the country and the people.

　　该是说话和行动的时候了！
    刘秀珍
    在我的生活史上，还没有这样积极过，二十多年来，我都是不得已的麻痹着自己，打牌、吸烟，我的地位愈高，我愈感到苦恼、害怕。旧社会是没有是非的，记得，有一位军长的太太，当他自北平飞西安时，路经上海，下机游玩，当天上海恰好有梅兰芳的戏，戏票前好几天就卖完了，但是这位太太不惜以百万元一张的高价买到一张飞票，又用八十万元买了一双最新式的鞋，这位太太到西安就以这两件事到处夸耀，并以此为荣，别人也都啧啧称羡，到处传扬着。假若你不以这种挥霍为然，那么，你就是不合潮流，不够派头，人们相处，日常所谈的就是：时兴什么，穿什么！再不就是打牌、看戏，消耗着时间和金钱，不能这样耍阔的，就只好坐在家里不出去。我想，像我这样的地位，尚且不能“随合潮流”，我军各级眷属的情形就可想而知了。
    当我来到解放区后，处处都感到很顺意，虽然在生活上是降低了些，但我的精神感到很愉快，这里的人们都是有意义地，有目的地生活着，人人都是向上的，求进的，在这样的影响下，我军的眷属们大部组织起来了。现在已经有七个单位成立了眷属学校，每天认真的学习着，愉快的劳动着，四十多岁的太太们，也开始认字，唱歌和纺线，假若把这种情形放在国民党统治区，恐怕将被人作为笑谈，但在这里却很自然。我现在也每天和大家在一起，指导着他们学习，和他们在一起纺线，一天的生活紧张而愉快，在这里我尝到了集体生活的愉快，劳动、学习和工作中的快慰了。我感到了生的意味。
    现在，我相信一个人到了解放区，只要没有过深的习气与成见，一定很快就会进步的，凡是对国民党统治不满的人，对解放区一定会满意的。全中国如果都像解放区一样，中国是不难强盛的，但是国民党反动派却不为国家、人民着想，处处依靠美帝国主义分子的援助，以百分之八十以上的兵力向着解放区、进行违反全国人民意志的内战，残杀为和平民主奔走呼号的李、闻等氏。国民党反动派为了达到其保持一党专政之目的，竟不惜将中国的领土，领海，领空，内河航权都送给美帝国主义分子，并将最后决定权亦交给他们，现在全国各地美货充斥，各大城市美兵到处横行。孙夫人说：“每一个具有人类感情的人，应当说话了。”是的，但愿我们妇女同胞们，也不应坐视这一灾难的来临，要用我们的喉咙和行动来反对国民党反动派出卖国家人民利益的叛国行为。
