Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 21st: Paris dispatch: The Paris Peace Conference's working groups are making progress. The Committee on Political and Territorial Matters for Bulgaria completed its work on the 18th and will officially conclude after its final meeting on the 20th. The Conference has convened for eight weeks as of today, and the most important issue of Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border remains unresolved. The Italian Political Committee also concluded its discussion of this issue on the 19th and rejected a Brazilian amendment that proposed ceding a portion of the area inhabited by Slovenians (one of the Yugoslav nationalities) to Italy. The Eight-Nation Committee is still meeting and worked through the night of the 19th. The final vote by the Italian Political Committee on the port issue will have to wait until the work of the Eight-Nation Committee is completed. The Assistant Foreign Ministers' Conference, under the manipulation of the U.S. representative, has been engaging in idle talk for many days, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference did not convene this week. United Press reported that British officials declared on the 20th that the four powers will hold a meeting next week, and Bevin will return to Paris this weekend after a long stay in London.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 22nd: New York dispatch: The Security Council's debate on the Greek question has so far yielded no results. At the meeting on the 20th, when the draft resolutions proposed by various parties were put to a vote, the US and UK representatives rejected the Soviet proposal, while the Soviet Union rejected the proposals of the Netherlands and the United States. The Soviet proposal called for the Security Council to condemn the British troops stationed in Greece and Greece's provocative behavior towards Albania. The Dutch proposal called for the governments of Greece, Albania, and even Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to do their best to stop the chaos on the northern border of Greece. The American proposal simply refused to recognize the Soviet claim that Greece, with British assistance, was threatening peace in the Balkans, and proposed the establishment of a three-person committee to investigate all border issues in the Balkan countries. U.S. Representative Johnson, in his speech, also stated that the western border of Poland "still needs to be revised." The Soviet representative said that the American proposal was a kind of surgery, aimed at diverting the Security Council's attention from Ukraine's accusations against Greece.

    【新华社延安二十二日电】纽约讯：安理会关于希腊问题的辩论迄无结果，二十日会议上，当各方所提决议案付之表决时，美英代表否决了苏联的提案，苏联则否决了荷兰及美国的提案，苏联的提案为要求安理会谴责英军驻希与希对阿尔巴尼亚的挑衅行为，荷兰的提案要求希腊与阿尔巴尼亚甚至南斯拉夫保加利亚等国政府尽力制止希腊北部边界的混乱。美国的提案则根本拒绝承认苏联所说希腊在英国协助下威胁巴尔干和平的理由，而提议设立三人委员会，以调查所有巴尔干各国的边界问题。美代表詹森发言时，并说到波兰西部的边界“仍有修改的必要”，苏联代表说美国的提案是一种手术，目的在于转移安理会对乌克兰控诉希腊的处理。
