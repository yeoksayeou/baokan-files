　　Northeast China Kuomintang Troops Obstruct the Repatriation of Prisoners
    Even Open Fire on Japanese Nationals Being Sent by Our Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th] Kuomintang troops violated the agreement and opened fire on Japanese nationals being repatriated by the Democratic Allied Army, undermining the prisoner repatriation work. When the first group of Japanese nationals was sent from Lafa via Beidao to the Kuomintang-controlled area on the 25th, the Kuomintang troops not only refused to accept them at the time, but also opened fire on the Japanese nationals sent by the Democratic Allied Army. The Kuomintang propaganda machine has slandered the Democratic Allied Army for being unwilling to repatriate prisoners, but today the Kuomintang troops are obstructing the progress of the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners.

　　东北蒋军阻碍遣俘
    竟向我军送出之日侨扫射
    【新华社哈尔滨二十九日电】蒋军违约扫射民主联军所遣送回国之日侨，破坏遣俘工作，当第一批日侨于二十五日由拉法经北道送往国民党区时，蒋军当时不但拒绝接受，反向民主联军送出之日侨开枪扫射。国民党宣传机关曾污蔑民主联军不愿遣俘，而今日蒋军又阻碍遣送日俘工作之进行。
