　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: TASS, New York - Radio commentator Steele, commenting on US-Soviet relations on the 14th, stated that after talks with senior qualified authorities in Paris, he believes that Western countries can establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union, as long as such relations are based on the principle of complete equality between countries, as advocated by the Soviet Union. He said that Soviet leaders emphasized that they desire peaceful and friendly trade relations and greatly hope to purchase large quantities of American goods on credit loans rather than political concessions. The Soviets are extremely hostile to Churchill but fondly remember Roosevelt. I am satisfied that the Soviet leaders I met in Paris desire the success of the peace conference. They are prepared to ignore minor differences of opinion, but they will never compromise on what they consider matters of principle. When asked if they felt that relations with the United States had deteriorated, they insisted that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the American people had not changed. Soviet leaders and the people are willing to live in peace and friendship with the American people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Comprehensive Washington report: After the uproar within the United States caused by US Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech in New York on the 12th, Wallace released on the 17th a letter he sent to President Truman on July 23rd. The 6,000-word letter warned that "American foreign policy will lead to an atomic war with the Soviet Union" and advocated "improving the current tense US-Soviet relations through peaceful coexistence." After the letter was sent, Truman's press secretary, Ross, declared that Truman did not agree to the publication of the letter, fearing that it would mislead people into believing that the president endorsed the letter's arguments. The letter was sent to Truman over fifty days before its publication, but Ross said there was no time to notify Wallace not to publish it. According to Wallace's statement on the evening of the 17th, the publication of the letter was approved by the White House, and the theme of the letter had been "discussed" with Truman. On the evening of the 18th, Wallace and Truman met for more than two hours and have reached a temporary compromise. After the meeting, Wallace announced that he would not make any public statements or speeches until the end of the Paris Peace Conference. His speech scheduled for the 23rd has been canceled, and he will continue to be the Secretary of Commerce under Truman's policy. A reporter asked what assurances President Truman had given him to decide to temporarily refrain from making speeches on foreign policy issues. Wallace replied that the president is convinced that peace with the Soviet Union will be guaranteed and stated that he still insists on the speech delivered in New York. On the 19th, Truman's press secretary Ross stated that there was no consultation between Truman and Wallace on the issue of Wallace's resignation, and he emphatically denied the rumor that Truman had allowed Wallace to make minimal concessions in exchange for the latter's compromise, that is, not to make speeches before the end of the Paris Peace Conference. On the same day, Truman spoke with Secretary of State Byrnes via transatlantic telephone. According to American sources, Byrnes "expressed great happiness" after the call. Before Truman met with Wallace, it was reported that Byrnes often had his resignation letter in his pocket, but he would not decide whether to resign until the final decisive meeting between Truman and Wallace at the White House.

　　纽约广播评论家宣称
    苏美人民咸望和好相处
    华莱士公布与杜鲁门长函主苏美友好
    【新华社延安十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：广播评论家斯蒂尔于十四日评论美苏关系时称：他在巴黎与高级有资格的当权人士会谈之后，相信西方国家能够与苏联建立友好关系，只要这种关系是以苏联所主张的各国之间完全平等的原则为基础就行。他说苏联领袖着重说，他们愿望和平友好的贸易关系，并甚望能给信用贷款、而非政治让步的条件下，购买大批美国货。苏联人极仇视邱吉尔，但却怀念着罗斯福。我在巴黎所见到的苏联领袖们愿望和会成功，这使我感到满意，他们准备不理那些小的分歧意见，但他们认为是原则问题的则绝不妥协。当问及他们是否感到与美国关系已恶化时，他们则坚持说：苏联对于美国人民的态度并未变化，苏联领袖与人民愿意与美国人民和平友好相处。
    【新华社延安二十日电】综合华府讯：美商务部长华莱士十二日在纽约的演说引起美国内的勃然风波后，华莱士并于十七日公布其于七月二十三日致杜鲁门总统的一封信，长达六千字，该信警告“美国的外交政策将引起对苏的原子战争”，并主张“以和平相处的方法，改善目前紧张的美苏关系”。该信发出后，杜鲁门新闻秘书罗思即宣称：杜鲁门不同意发表该信，理由为恐使人误解总统赞成该信之论点。按该信从至杜鲁门到公布之日，其间有五十余天之久，但罗思说来不及通知华莱士勿发表此信。据华莱士十七日晚宣称：该信之发表经白宫批准，且该信的主题曾与杜鲁门“商量”过。十八日晚，华莱士与杜鲁门会谈两小时余，业已获得暂时妥协，会后华莱士宣称：他将不作任何公开谈话或演说，以迄巴黎和会闭幕为止。渠定于二十三日发表之演说已取消，他将继续在杜鲁门政策之商务部长。某记者询问杜鲁门总统究竟给以何种确证使他决定对外交问题暂不发表演说，华氏答称：总统确信对苏联将保障和平，并称他仍坚持在纽约发表之演说。十九日杜鲁门新闻秘书罗思则称：杜鲁门与华莱士之间对华氏辞职问题并无磋商，他并着重否认下述传说，即杜鲁门已向华莱士允许作最少让步，以换取后者的妥协，即在巴黎和会结束之前不发表演说。同日，杜鲁门经大西洋长途电话与国务卿贝纳斯通话，据美方人士称：贝纳斯在通话后“表示很高兴”。在杜鲁门与华莱士会晤之前，据悉贝纳斯之口袋中经常有辞呈，但他在杜鲁门与华莱士于白宫作最后决定性会议之前，则不作是否辞职之决定。
