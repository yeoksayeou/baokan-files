　　Model Communist Party Member Cui Xiaomao
    Selflessly Arrests His Own Brother
    Tian Zhen
    (I) Comrade Xiaomao is a Combat Hero
    Comrade Cui Xiaomao is the squad leader of the Third Company, First Battalion, Second Regiment. He is 22 years old this year and a young Communist Party member.
    In the army, everyone admires his resourcefulness and bravery in combat, and everyone says, "Comrade Xiaomao is especially kind to his comrades." Precisely because Comrade Xiaomao harbors extreme hatred for the enemy and boundless love for his comrades, he can create heroic deeds in battle.
    In two years of combat, he has completed many arduous combat missions. He has captured Japanese devils alive. He has gloriously been wounded in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. He has seized thirteen rifles and a small cannon from the enemy...
    During the liberation of Qinyang, Comrade Xiaomao led a soldier, braving the rain of bullets, to carry back two comrades who had sacrificed themselves for several days from under the city wall.
    Therefore, Comrade Xiaomao was elected as a combat hero.
    (II) "He hates his heartless elder brother!"
    His wife came from home to see him and told him: "Your elder brother has moved two phonographs from somewhere to our house, and I heard that he also has guns from the XX Army." When Comrade Xiaomao heard this, his joyful face immediately became gloomy. He knew that his elder brother had served as a puppet soldier and would do bad things. He couldn't sleep all night thinking about the past.
    He remembered how his family was ruined. Due to debts, the village chief took away all the land and houses in the family, and his mother and his own children starved to death. His wife also left home because she couldn't live...
    He even more remembered the situation after the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came: the land and houses were returned, his wife came back, and he had a home again...
    He also thought: "I joined the army to fight desperately for the people, and now I am a Communist Party member, I should be doing everything for the people."...
    So, he decided to personally go back to arrest his elder brother. He firmly said to the instructor: "Regardless of whether he is my elder brother or not, whatever he violates, he will be punished accordingly!"
    (III) He Arrested His Elder Brother
    The next day, Comrade Xiaomao led several soldiers and set off for his village.
    In the village, he ran into his elder brother, and he ordered the soldiers to tie up his elder brother.
    His elder brother said in panic and anger: "We are brothers, why didn't you give me a heads-up and let me hide?"
    Comrade Xiaomao's eyes were blazing, and he said hatefully to his elder brother: "You don't even know the bad things you've done!"
    (IV) Sincere Persuasion Made His Elder Brother Turn Back
    After taking his elder brother back to the company, Comrade Xiaomao repeatedly said to his elder brother: "Our family was saved by the Eighth Route Army, why are you working for the XX Army?" He persuaded his elder brother to honestly tell what he had done.
    Under his sincere persuasion, his elder brother turned back and frankly confessed the process of participating in stealing weapons stored by our army and the Kuomintang secret service organization in Xiuwu County, and handed over the weapons he knew.
    So, Comrade Xiaomao again led the soldiers to retrieve a small cannon, a submachine gun, several rifles, and telephone equipment, etc. with his elder brother.
    (V) Awarded the Title of Model Communist Party Member
    Comrade Xiaomao's selfless behavior caused a sensation throughout the entire army. The Party Committee decided to award Comrade Cui Xiaomao the honorary title of "Model Communist Party Member" and called on all Party members to learn from Comrade Xiaomao. (Attached photo)

　　模范共产党员崔小毛
    大公无私捉来亲哥哥
    田振
    （一）小毛同志是个战斗英雄
    崔小毛同志是二团一营三连的班长，今年廿二岁，是一个青年共产党员。
    在部队中，谁都佩服他作战时机智勇敢，谁都说“小毛同志对同志特别慈爱”。正因为小毛同志对敌人抱有极端仇恨，对同志抱有无限热爱，他才能在战斗中创造英雄的事迹。
    在两年的战斗中，他完成了许多艰巨的战斗任务，他曾经活捉过日本鬼子，他曾经与敌人肉搏而光荣负伤，他从敌人手中夺获过十三支步枪和一门小炮………
    解放沁阳战斗中，小毛同志带了一个战士冒着弹雨将两个牺牲了几天的战友从城墙下背了回来。
    因此，小毛同志当选了战斗英雄。
    （二）“他恨没良心的亲哥”！
    老婆从家里来看他，告诉他说：“你哥哥不知从那里搬到咱家两个戏匣子，听说还有××军的枪。”小毛同志听到这事，喜悦的面孔立刻变得忧闷起来了，他知道哥哥当过伪军，是会干出坏事来的，他一夜都睡不着的在想着过去的事情。
    他想起自己是怎样家破人亡的。因欠债，欠款，保长夺走了家中所有的土地和房产，母亲与自己的小孩子活活饿死了，老婆也因无法生活而离开了自己的家……
    他更想起共产党八路军来了以后的情形：土地房屋要回来了，老婆回来了，自己又有了家……
    他又想到：“我参加部队是为了老百姓拚命打仗，我现在是个共产党员，更应该处处为了老百姓”。……
    于是，他决心亲自回去逮捕自己的哥哥，他向指导员坚决的说：“管他亲哥不亲哥，犯了那一条就罚他那一条！”
    （三）把哥哥捉了回来
    第二天，小毛同志带着几个战士向自己的村庄出发了。
    在村里，碰上了他的哥哥，他命令战士们将哥哥捆起来。
    哥哥惊慌而生气的说：“咱们是弟兄，为啥不先打个招呼，叫我躲起来呢？”
    小毛同志的眼睛冒火了，他恨恨的对哥哥说：“你自己做的坏事还不知道！”
    （四）诚恳的劝说使哥哥回头了
    把哥哥捉回连队后，小毛同志一再的向他哥哥说：“咱家是八路军救活的，你为啥替××军办事？”他劝哥哥将自己做的事情坦白的说出来。
    在他的诚恳劝说下，哥哥回头了，坦白的讲出参加偷我军存放枪支的经过及修武县的特务组织，交出所知道的武器。
    于是，小毛同志又带着战士们随哥哥去取回了一门小炮，一支冲锋机枪，几支步枪和电话机子等。
    （五）获得了模范共产党员的称号
    小毛同志这种大公无私的行为轰动了整个部队，党委会决定给崔小毛同志以“模范共产党员”的光荣称号，号召全体党员向小毛同志学习。（附图片）
