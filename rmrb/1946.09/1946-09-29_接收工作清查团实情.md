The reality of the Receiving Work Investigation Team
　　Lan Yunfu

　　“Having grabbed all the materials, they lost all the hearts of the people,” referring to the so-called “receiving” of enemy and puppet materials. Almost a year later, at the end of July, the Kuomintang authorities jointly formed the so-called "Receiving and Handling Enemy and Puppet Materials Work Investigation Teams" from the Central Supervisory Committee of the party, the Control Yuan, and the National Political Council in the seven regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Northeast; Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi; Guangdong and Guangxi; Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan; Fujian and Taiwan; and Shandong and Henan, and successively went to various places to investigate.

　　Is this a sign of punishing corruption? Gu Zhongxiu, the speaker of the Beiping Provisional Council, said at a reception for the investigation team in the area on the 1st of last month: “It is very regrettable that we have only come to Beiping for investigation today, because the selling of materials has entered a stage where it is impossible to investigate.” Huang Yuren, a member of the investigation team, also admitted that “there is a reason for the incident, but there is no evidence to be found. What was received last year is not even a shadow this year.” Even semi-official newspapers believe that the team is a useless decoration without any real power. The Tianjin Yishibao questioned in its editorial on August 3rd: "If the main culprits of corruption are found to be senior officials, who will guarantee the safety of the investigation team?"

　　It can be seen that the so-called "investigation" by the Kuomintang authorities or senior officials is not aimed at investigating their own theft, but at concealing their own corruption in the face of accusations from national public opinion. Please look at the facts:

　　Regarding the investigation in the Hunan-Hubei area, Qiu Ao, the head of the team, said in Changsha on the 19th of last month: "The receiving personnel are all figures with 'connections'. I don't have the power to act first and report later. In Hankou, I encountered people with great backgrounds in small institutions who were still arrogant in front of me. What can I do!"

　　The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui area immediately encountered the 4.2 billion yuan embezzlement case of the two Shanghai mayors, Qian Dajun and Wu Guozhen, and had to push it to other agencies for "investigation." They left Shanghai for Hangzhou on September 9th. The people there sent secret letters exposing more than 400 cases, with the exposure of the Third Front Army being the most numerous, but none have been announced to this day.

　　The people in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) and other places have exposed a total of more than 1,300 cases, but only investigated eight minor officials such as the director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau, a naval colonel, and the director of the Beiping police sub-bureau, totaling no more than ten cases, accounting for only 0.7% of the number of exposures by the people. As for the "disappearance" of thousands of houses and hundreds of factories in the hands of the Ministry of Military Administration, the Hebei Provincial Government, and the Tianjin Municipal Government, and the embezzlement of hundreds of shops, the spoilage of 18,000 tons of grain and a large number of clothes in Beiping, they simply dare not investigate.

　　When the investigation team first arrived, the citizens of Tianjin hoped that they would not "only swat flies and not tigers." However, the facts have proved that the "flies" they "swatted" were still the minority among the minorities, and they even "swatted" out party thugs. After the case of Wang Xida, the director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau, was exposed and announced, Mayor Zhang Ting'e was furious and lectured the staff of the Public Works Bureau, saying that the informant was not born of his parents and that he should be severely punished."

　　Not only that, but the personnel participating in the investigation team included many idle people from the "CC" clique. The citizens of Beiping gossiped in the streets and alleys, saying: "These people did not get much benefit in the receiving, so they came here to extort a sum of money." Gu Zhongxiu, the speaker of the Ping Provisional Council, said in his speech at the welcoming meeting for the investigation team that he "let the cat out of the bag" and said: "Profiting from national disasters, profiting from victory, today's investigation, I hope not to profit from the investigation again." On the 16th of last month, the newspapers in Beiping published a news item saying: The investigation team obtained an important confidential letter and is investigating it, and it will be announced soon. However, as a result, the next day, the newspapers published a statement from the person in charge of the investigation team saying: The case "does not seem to be very serious," and it was glossed over. However, according to a reporter's investigation: This case is related to a senior military officer in the headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone, and dozens of "received" cars are still parked in his private residence. This matter seems to reveal the dramatic arrangement of bargaining between the investigation and the investigated parties.

　　In short, the "investigation team's" work in the past two months has not achieved the Kuomintang authorities' expected goals of concealing their corruption and regaining lost popular support. On the contrary, it has once again made a fool of itself. Because of this, some Kuomintang party newspapers are already shouting, saying that newspapers should not publish too many cases reported by the people to the "investigation team" to avoid "affecting the prestige of government officials." So, how will the "investigation team" step down? Let's wait and see.

　　接收工作清查团实情
　　蓝芸夫
    “抢尽物资失尽人心”，即所谓“接收”敌伪物资。差不多一年之后，国民党当局于七月底由该党中央监委会、监察院及国参会三个机关共同组成苏浙皖、东北、湘鄂赣、粤桂、冀热察绥、闽台、鲁豫七个区的所谓“接收处理敌伪物资工作清查团”，先后分赴各地清查。
    这是表示要惩办贪污吗？北平市临参会议谷钟秀上月一日在该区清查团招待会上说：“迟至今日，始来北平清查，十分遗憾，因物资之盗卖，已入无法清查阶段。”清查团团员黄宇人亦承认“事出有因，查无实据，去年接收的，今年连影子都没有了”。即令是半官方的报纸，也认为该团是没有权利的一个徒然的装饰物。天津益世报于八月三日的社论中发问道：“假如查出贪污主犯是什么大员，谁又作清查团安全的保障”？
    可见国民党当局或大员们的所谓“清查”云云，其目的并不是要清查他们自己的盗窃行为，而是要在全国舆论的责难前面，掩饰他们自己的贪污丑事。请看事实：
    湘鄂区清查情形，据该团团长仇鳌上月十九日在长沙说：“接收人员均系‘关系方面’人物，我无上方宝剑，不能先斩后奏，我在汉口会碰到小机关里大有背景的人物，在我面前还神气活现，我有什么办法！”
    苏浙皖区开始即遭到上海两届市长钱大钧、吴国桢四十二亿元的盗卖案，只得推给其他机关“清查”，于九月九日离沪赴杭，而该地人民密函揭发案子达四百多件，以揭发第三方面军为最多，迄今一件也没有公布。
    平津各地人民揭发的案子共达一千三百多件，只清查了天津公用局长、海军上校、北平警察分局长等八个小官儿，总共不出十件，仅占人民揭发数目的百分之零点七。而对于军政部冀省府、津市府等手中数千房屋，数百工厂的“失踪”，数百商店的被私吞，北平一万八千吨粮食及大批衣服的霉烂，则根本不敢清查。
    清查团刚到时，天津市民曾希望他们不要“只拍苍蝇不打老虎”，事实却证明他们所“拍”的“苍蝇”，也还是少数中的极少数，而且居然也“拍”出党棍来了。当津市公用局长王锡达案被告发公布后，市长张廷锷老爷大发雷霆，对公用局职员训话，说告发人不是父母所生的，要将他彻底严办”。
    不但如此，参加清查团的人员中，包括不少“ＣＣ”派的闲人，北平的市民街谈巷议说：“这些人在接收中没有分到许多油水，此来还不是要敲一笔竹杠。”平临参会议长谷钟秀在欢迎清查团的会上致词中，据说是“话走了口”说：“国难发国难财、胜利发胜利财，今天清查，不希望再发清查财”。上月十六日，北平各报发表了一则新闻说：清查团获一重大告密函，正进行调查，不日即可公布，但结果，第二天各报上就登出清查团负责人的谈话说：该案“不见如何严重”，就这样幌过去了。但据某报记者探悉：此案系关联到十一战区司令长官部的某高级军官，至今其私宅院中尚停有几十辆“接收”的汽车。此事似乎透露了清查与被清查双方讨价还价的戏剧性的安排。
    总之，“清查团”两个月来的工作，并没有达到国民党当局掩饰其贪污腐败，挽回已失人心的预期目的，相反的，倒是再一次的出了丑。正因如此，若干国民党机关报已在叫了，说各报不要多发表人民向“清查团”告发的案件，以免“影响政府官员的威信”。那么，“清查团”究竟怎样下台呢？让我们等着看吧。
