　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Reuters, New York: Soviet representative Gromyko issued a statement at the Security Council on the evening of the 23rd, requesting that the following proposal be included in the agenda: all United Nations members must report on the situation of their troops stationed in non-former enemy countries. Gromyko stated: The U.S. military in China supports one of the two groups in the civil war and is interfering in China's internal affairs. He said: Although at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes said that as soon as the Japanese troops were repatriated, the U.S. military would withdraw, but now they are still stationed in China (Note: The work of the U.S. military repatriating Japanese troops from North China, Central China, and South China was announced to be completed on July 15). He also said: China, Egypt, Iraq, Iceland, Latin America, and Greece have issued complaints about the stationing of foreign troops. The presence of British troops in Iraq cannot but be considered a threat to Iraq's independence; the Council should describe the situation in Indonesia as "an unacceptable and unjust use of force against peaceful residents." Gromyko asked: Can we ignore the demands of the people of these countries for the withdrawal of foreign troops and against these troops interfering in their internal affairs? Can we ignore the complex situation caused by the long-term stationing of foreign troops? Gromyko turned to the U.S. and British representatives and asked, "Is anyone afraid that the discussion will reveal information about the presence of foreign troops in certain countries?" Previously, British representative Jebb had opposed including the Soviet Union's request in the agenda, and he asked Gromyko for the basis of the proposal in the Charter, to which Gromyko replied that it was based on Article 34, "situations that may cause international friction." U.S. representative Johnson argued that the U.S. military stationed in China had been permitted by the national authorities there.

　　苏联代表向安理会声明
　　美军驻华干涉内政
　　联合国必须报告其军队驻非前敌国的情形
    【新华社延安二十五日电】路透社纽约讯：苏联代表葛罗米柯二十三日晚在安理会发表声明，要求将其下列建议列入议程，即所有联合国必须报告其军队驻在非前敌国的情形。葛氏声明说：美国在华军队支持内战两集团中的一方，是在干涉着中国的内政。他说：虽然在莫斯科外长会议上，美国务卿贝纳斯说过一俟日军遣送完毕，美军即撤离，但是现在却依然驻留中国（按：美军遣送华北、华中、华南日本之工作，已于七月十五日宣布完成）。又说：中国、埃及、伊拉克、冰岛、拉丁美洲与希腊已发出控诉外国军队的驻屯。英军的存在于伊拉克，不能不认为是对伊拉克独立的威胁；印尼的形势，理事会应称之为“对和平居民不可容许与不公正地使用军队”。葛氏问道：我们能够无视这些国家的人民关于撤退外国军队、反对这些军队干涉他们内政的要求吗？我们能够无视外国军队的长时驻扎所造成的复杂情况吗？葛氏转向美英代表问道：“是不是有人害怕讨论会显露出外国军队存在于某些国家的情报呢”？前此，英代表贾德干曾反对把苏联这一要求列入议程，他并问葛氏建议在宪章上的根据，而葛氏则告以是根据第三十四条“可能引起国际磨擦的形势”。美代表詹森则辩称：美军驻在中国，已得到该处国家当局的许可。
