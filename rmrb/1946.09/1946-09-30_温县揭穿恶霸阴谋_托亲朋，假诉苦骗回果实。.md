　　Wen County Exposes the Conspiracy of Local Tyrants
　　Entrusting Relatives and Friends to Falsely Plead Hardship to Deceive and Recover Fruits.
    [Reported by our newspaper from Wen County] During a recent campaign in Wen County, it was discovered that relatives and friends of local tyrant landlords were feigning hardship in mass struggles to fraudulently obtain the fruits of struggle, preserving the ill-gotten gains of the local tyrant landlords. The family members of a certain work comrade in the county (who is a local tyrant landlord) recently told him: "Our family has been struggled against several times, but our relatives and friends are quite good. As soon as they heard that the masses were struggling against our family, they quickly fabricated some grievances and pleaded hardship at the meeting, getting a lot of things. After the struggle, they immediately wanted to return the distributed items to us, but I said let's wait a few more days to see how the wind blows." Similar conspiracies were also discovered in the mass struggles in the First District. The local tyrant's relatives and friends who pretended to plead hardship, pleaded "very painfully" and were "very active" in the liquidation, but after dividing the fruits, they secretly returned them to the local tyrant. This matter has now attracted everyone's attention. It is imperative that the fruits are not distributed to those who falsely plead hardship. Their conspiracies should be exposed at any time, the masses should be educated, and close attention should be paid to preventing the deception to obtain fruits.

　　温县揭穿恶霸阴谋
　　托亲朋，假诉苦骗回果实。
    【本报温县讯】温县在最近的一段运动中发现恶霸地主的亲戚朋友在群众斗争中假装诉苦，骗取斗争果实，为恶霸地主保存掠夺所得的财产。该县某工作同志家属（恶霸地主）最近对他说：“咱家被斗争了好几次，亲戚朋友都还不错。他们一听说群众和咱家斗争，就赶快假编了些冤事，到大会上诉苦，分了不少东西。斗争过了，他们要把分的东西马上给咱，我说再等几天看看风势再说吧。”在一区群众斗争中，也发现类似的阴谋。假装诉苦的恶霸亲友，苦也诉的“很痛”，清算也“很积极”，但分得果实后，即秘密送还恶霸。现此事已引起大家注意，确实不能分配果实给假诉苦者，并应随时揭发其阴谋，教育群众，严密注意骗取果实。
