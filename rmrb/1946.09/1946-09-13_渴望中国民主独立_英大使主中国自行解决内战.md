　　Yearning for China's Democracy and Independence
    British Ambassador Advocates China Resolving its Own Civil War
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: New York News: American newspapers are still paying close attention to the Chinese political deadlock. All newspapers published news on the front page saying that Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart seemed to have given up hope of promoting reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They also published articles and cartoons about the Chinese situation. The Washington Post published a cartoon entitled "Cliff," showing Marshall standing on the edge of a cliff, with the words "Failure of American Policy Toward China" on the edge of the cliff. Also: On August 13, the New York Herald Tribune said: It would be a great misfortune for the whole world if the war in China could not be stopped. It also said that the government's (referring to the Kuomintang government) recent measures have made its intention to abandon peace obvious. We will never sympathize with the ruling method of fascist means; our consistent proposition is to hope that China will become a democratic and independent government.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Nanjing News: "China's civil war can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves." This was British Ambassador Stevenson's opinion on the China issue when he hosted a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in Shanghai on the 9th. Stevenson also solemnly stated that Britain is very willing to conduct trade and commerce with China. The British trade delegation to China, led by Bowles, will arrive in China at the end of this month to inspect China's industry and commerce. Stevenson also said that he would strive to enhance Sino-British cooperation and friendship, and would like to do his best to assist China's reconstruction work. The ambassador came to China at the beginning of the month, flew from Nanjing to Guling on the 6th to present his credentials, and returned to Nanjing and then to Shanghai on the 7th. When Stevenson was in Nanjing, he met with a reporter from the Central News Agency alone and said: "I feel distressed about the current political situation in China, as my old Chinese friends inevitably would." When asked about when the new Sino-British trade agreement would be signed, Stevenson said: The new Sino-British trade agreement has not yet been signed. The new Sino-British trade agreement will only be possible after the new Sino-US trade agreement is signed. However, the British draft of the new trade agreement has already been submitted to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

　　渴望中国民主独立
    英大使主中国自行解决内战
    【新华社延安十日电】纽约讯：美国各报对于中国政治僵局仍异常的注意，各报均在封面登载电讯说，马歇尔特使与司徒大使显已放弃促成国共和解的希望。并登载关于中国时局的论文与漫画。华盛顿邮报登载漫画名曰“悬崖”，给马歇尔站立悬崖边缘，崖边有“美国对华政策失败”字样。又讯：八月十三日，纽约先锋论坛报说：中国的战争如果没有法子停止，实在是全世界的大不幸。并说政府（指国民党政府）最近的措施，放弃和平的意图已经达到表面化，我们决不同情于法西斯手段的统治方法；渴望中国成为民主独立的政府，乃是我们一贯的主张。
    【新华社延安十日电】南京讯：“中国之内战只有中国人自行解决”，此为英大使施蒂文森九日在沪省招待中外记者时所发表对中国问题的意见。施氏并郑重表示英国甚愿与中国通商贸易，由鲍尔斯率领的英贸易访华团将于本月底抵华，考察中国之工商业。施氏又表示渠当努力增进中英之合作与友谊，并愿尽力协助中国之复兴工作。大使系于月初来华，六日由南京飞往牯岭，呈递国书，七日返南京转沪。施氏在京时，曾单独接见中央社记者称：“余为中国目前政局感觉苦恼，一如其中国老友不得不然。”述及中英新商约何时签订一事，施氏称：中英新商约尚未签订，中英新商约将系中美新商约签订后始可进行，惟英方之新商约草案早经送交中国外交部。
