Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: A CCP spokesperson told reporters today: The US government and the Chiang Kai-shek government, disregarding the opposition of the Chinese people, have finally completed the transfer negotiations for a large amount of wartime materials in the Western Pacific. This action is tantamount to a provocation. The US spokesperson hypocritically announced that these materials do not include "purely military supplies" or "military supplies that have not been converted for civilian use," and said that the sale could provide China with much-needed transportation and road construction equipment, "assist China in achieving peace and unity," and "can be immediately distributed to the 450 million people of China," and "the long-suffering Chinese people will surely be slightly relieved by obtaining this large batch of materials." But they know very well that these materials are entirely supplied to Chiang Kai-shek for the civil war, and even civilian goods will be immediately converted into "extremely needed" military supplies, especially for roads and transportation. Because roads are only used for transporting troops before the end of the war, and China's original civilian transportation tools have now been converted for military use. Therefore, after Chiang Kai-shek obtains this road construction equipment and vehicles, he will realize his plan to organize a rapid force with 10,000 vehicles, and the long-suffering 450 million Chinese people will inevitably fall into greater and longer suffering of civil war and division. A representative of the US Navy Department stated that the agreement is "further promoting the close relationship between the two countries." The Chinese people can indeed see from this the "close relationship" between the US government's creation of the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the Chinese people will never recognize any such agreement. US Special Envoy General Marshall was asked to prevent this peace-endangering negotiation before peace was achieved in China, but he obviously did not want to do so. People and General Marshall himself must now understand: Is the current task of General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart Leighton to help China achieve peace, or just to be a pitiful cover for the US government's creation of the Chinese civil war?
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to reports from the Central News Agency and the US Information Service: The secret negotiations between the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek government to transfer surplus war materials have been completed. On the 31st, Song Ziwen, Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang government, and McCabe, Director of the US Foreign Liquidation Commission and Special Assistant to the State Department, jointly announced the establishment of the general treaty for the negotiations. It is said that the Kuomintang government purchased surplus materials from the US government worth a total of 800 million US dollars (excluding the transactions in Western China last year), and only paid 175 million US dollars at a discount, and the US arrears to China can be used to offset the payment. (It is reported that in this transaction, the Chiang government sold China's airspace rights, and the value of the US surplus materials it obtained is said to be actually 2 billion US dollars).

### 中共发言人严正指出  中美反动派蓄意挑战  悍然完成物资谈判  中国人民决不承认这种协定

　　中共发言人严正指出
    中美反动派蓄意挑战
    悍然完成物资谈判 
    中国人民决不承认这种协定
    【新华社延安四日电】中共发言人今日告记者说：美国政府与蒋介石政府不顾中国人民的反对，终于完成了西太平洋大宗战时物资的让售谈判，这种行动实无异于挑战。美国发言人虚伪的宣布这些物资并不包括“纯粹军用品”或“未改民用的军用品”，并说该项买卖可予中国以极需要的交通工具和建路设备，可以“协助中国获得和平与团结”，并“可立即分配与中国四万万五千万人民”，“久经苦难之中国人民，必因获得此大批物资而稍苏”。但是他们很明白，这些物资是完全供给蒋介石用于内战的，即是民用品亦将立即改为“极需要”的军用品，此于公路与交通工具尤为明显。因公路在战争未结束前仅为运输军队，而中国原有的民运交通工具现在都已改为军用，因此蒋介石在获得此项建路设备与车辆后，将实现其以一万辆汽车组织快速部队的计划，而久经苦难的中国四万万五千万人民，必因而陷于更大更久的内战与分裂的苦难。美海军部代表声明该项协定是“进一步促进两国之密切关系”。中国人民的确可以由此看出：美国政府制造中国内战与蒋介石出卖中国主权间之“密切关系”。因此，中国人民决不能承认任何这种协定。美国全权特使马歇尔将军曾被要求在中国和平未实现前阻止此项危害和平的谈判，但显然他不愿如此做。人们和马歇尔将军自己，现在必须弄清楚：马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使现在的任务究竟是帮助中国得到和平，还是仅仅做美国政府制造中国内战的可怜的掩护物？
    【新华社延安四日电】据中央社及美新闻处电：美国政府以剩余战争物资让给蒋介石政府的秘密谈判业已完成。三十一日由国民党政府行政院长宋子文及美国国外物资清理局长兼国务院特别帮办麦凯布共同发表该项谈判一般条约的成立。据称：国民党政府向美国政府购买剩余物资共值八万万美金（去年在华西之买卖尚未计入），仅折价付一万万七千五百万美金，而且可以美国积欠中国之费用划抵。（按在此项买卖中，蒋政府出卖了中国的领空权，其所获得的美国剩余物资的价值，据传实际为二十万万美金）
