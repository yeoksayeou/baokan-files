Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 27th: Kuomintang authorities, in an attempt to eliminate the local Yunnan army, issued an order in early July to transfer the 24th Division of the Yunnan Army to northern Hubei for combat. Soldiers of the division, opposed to the civil war and seeing through the authorities' plot to eliminate dissidents, deserted en masse en route out of Yunnan. According to a detailed report in the Chengdu Xinmin Evening News, the 24th Provisional Division was led by Long Shengzu, son of Long Yun. At the time, it was under the command of Huo Kuizhang, Commander of the Kunming Garrison Headquarters. Huo, citing that the division had "no garrison mission in Yunnan," ordered Long's division to move north to Wuhan for garrison duty in northern Hubei, to fight against the Li Xiannian's Communist army. Long expressed his difficulty in accepting Huo's order, believing that troops that had not completely shed their local characteristics might not be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of a "long expedition." If they lost control and something went wrong, they could not be held responsible. Huo then decided to leave the weapons and equipment in Yunnan first, marching north empty-handed, and re-equip upon arrival at the destination. Long said that he should consider one point: What if they ran away? He said: Given the habits of Chinese soldiers, they will definitely run away en masse in this situation. Huo insisted on his original intention, saying: We'll deal with it if they run away. And he told Long to restrain them as much as possible. If desertions still occur after all possible efforts have been made, it is not one person's fault. Long then accepted the order, left the weapons, and led the division north. Soldiers deserted along the way and could not be stopped. First the soldiers fled, and then the officers in charge, fearing responsibility, also fled. Before getting even a hundred miles north of Qujing, they had all run away, leaving the division commander alone. As a result, he was sent to Nanjing to "report on his duties." Chen Cheng invited Long Yun for a conversation and finally asked Long Yun to take his son back and "supervise him closely."

　　出滇途中逃亡一空
    【新华社延安二十七日电】国民党当局为消灭云南地方军队，曾于七月初下令滇军第二十四师调往鄂北作战，该师官兵因反对内战并窥破当局消灭异己的阴谋，乃于出滇途中逃亡一空。兹据成都新民晚报报导这一事件的经过详情称：暂编第二十四师为龙云之子龙绳祖所率，当时属昆明警备总司令霍揆彰指挥，霍以该师“无驻滇任务，”饬令龙师北调武汉往鄂北驻防，与中共军李先念部作战。龙氏对霍之命令表示碍难接受，认为尚未完全脱离地方色彩之部队恐未能负担“远征”之重任，万一控制不了发生变故，则负不了责任。霍继决定先将武器装备留滇，徒手北上，殆抵达目的地时，再领新配备。龙氏表示应考虑一点：假如他们逃跑了呢？并称：以中国士兵习惯，在此情况下必逃跑一空。霍则坚持原意说：万一逃跑再说。并责龙氏尽可能约束，万一超过实际可能之一切努力仍发生逃跑，当非一人之过。龙氏乃接受命令，留下武器，率师北上。士兵沿途逃跑，无法制止。先是兵逃，兵逃后怕负责官也逃。北出曲靖不上百里，统统逃光，孤留师长一人，结果乃被送京“述职”。陈诚曾邀龙云氏谈话，最后请龙云氏将子领回“严加看管”。
