Wu'an County Government Vigorously Enforces Drug Prohibition
　 Major Drug Trafficker Du Zian Executed
　 【Our Newspaper Changzhi News】 Du Zian, a major drug trafficker in Wu'an City, was executed by the government on the 14th of this month. This criminal had been trafficking drugs and drug-making equipment to and from Tianjin and Beijing for a long time. In May of last year, he began manufacturing drugs himself, secretly selling them in Wu'an and Liaoxian, poisoning the people. In the street where Du lived, one-third of the households were poisoned by him. After the liberation of Wu'an, the democratic government repeatedly issued proclamations to prohibit drugs and urged drug dealers to repent and start anew. However, the criminal ignored the law, colluded with drug dealers in Anyang and other places to manufacture drugs on a large scale. Our government arrested him in April and confiscated his drug-making equipment and thirty taels of opium. After nine trials, the criminal confessed to the above crimes. In order to vigorously enforce drug prohibition, the government convened a public trial meeting on the 14th of this month. At the meeting, citizens accused the criminal of his crimes. Many citizens who were saved by our government and regained their health clenched their fists and shouted: "Demand that the government eliminate harm for the people!" The government immediately accepted the people's demands and sentenced him to death on the spot.

　　武安县府厉行禁毒
　  大毒品犯杜子安伏法
    【本报长治讯】武安城大毒品犯杜子安，已于本月十四日为政府处死。该犯往来平津贩运毒品及制毒器材，为时甚久，并于去年五月自行制造，潜销武安，辽县一带，毒害人民，仅杜所在街被其毒害者达总户数三分之一。武安解放后，民主政府为禁绝毒品曾屡次布告，促毒贩向政府悔过自新，乃该犯竟目无法纪，勾结安阳等地毒犯大肆制造，我政府乃于四月将其逮捕，并没收其制毒器材及烟土三十两；经九次审讯，该犯对以上罪行供认不讳，政府为厉行禁毒，乃于本月十四日召开公审大会，会上市民纷纷控诉该犯罪行，为我政府挽救而重获健康之许多市民更咬牙切齿举拳高呼：“要求政府为民除害！”政府当即接收人民要求，当场处以死刑。
