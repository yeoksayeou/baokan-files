　　[Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] An editorial in the Shanghai English-language *Continental Daily News* on August 19th pointed out that the economic foundation of the Kuomintang-controlled areas—agricultural production—is heading towards complete bankruptcy. After nearly thirty years of civil war and national disaster, and suffering heavy oppression under the current brutal civil war's levies, exorbitant taxes, and high rents, most farmers are moving to the cities, but they cannot find a livelihood there either, only exacerbating the increase in the urban unemployed population. It is noteworthy that the number of large landlords who have become rich by plundering farmers' land has increased. According to the Kuomintang Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Central Experimental Institute's own statistics, from 1911 to 1937, the number of tenant farmers nationwide increased from 28% to 37% of the population, while semi-tenant farmers increased from 23% to 26%. Taking Sichuan as an example, in the five years from 1937 to 1941, the province's landlord property increased by 69% to 70%, while in Xikang it increased by 69% to 73%, which runs counter to Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People's land policy. The report continued: The resulting sharp decline in the rural economy is reflected in the fact that raw silk, one of China's major exports, had an annual export of 80,000 piculs before the war, but this year it is only 15,000 piculs. Tea production was about 1.2 million piculs before the war, but this year it is only 300,000 piculs, and the situation with tung oil is similarly dismal.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] According to reports in the Beiping and Tianjin newspapers: The grain in the enemy and puppet warehouses in Beiping and other places, which was taken over by the Kuomintang authorities, has all or mostly rotted. The miscellaneous grains in the Xiannongtan warehouse, the flour in the Dongcheng warehouse, and the soybeans, corn, millet, and sorghum in the Guang'anmenwai warehouse are either teeming with maggots and unbearable to look at, or reeking with a foul odor and have become piles of manure. The largest open-air warehouse in Beiping, the Fourth Warehouse under the jurisdiction of the Hebei Provincial Field and Grain Administration outside Guang'anmen, had a storage of more than 31,000 tons of grain. After being stolen and exposed to the elements, little remains. It is said that it will be given to merchants to brew wine. The situation in Tianjin is even worse. Last winter, the Social Affairs Bureau handled more than 2,000 packages of grain for winter relief, which were secretly placed in the No. 51 Primary School on Bohai Avenue for more than half a year. To this day, all of it is rotten and stinking. The bureau has separately notified various newspapers to prohibit the publication of this news and is transporting the moldy grain day and night to the Yihe Grain Store, where the owner wants to use it as fertilizer.

　　蒋家暴政统治区
    农村经济陷于破产
    野有饿莩平津存粮腐烂甚多
    【新华社南京七日电】上海英文大陆报八月十九日专论指出，目前国民党统治区的经济基础——农业生产，正走向完全破产之途。农民经历了近三十年来的内战和民族灾难，并在当前横暴的内战的征发苛杂高租下受着惨重的压榨，其大多数正纷纷向城市迁移，但他们那里也无法求生，徒然促使城市失业人口激增。值得注意的，便是借掠夺农民土地暴富的大地主数目的增加，据国民党农林部中央实验所自己的统计，一九一一至三七年，全国佃农已由人口百分之二十八增到百分之三十七，半佃农则由百分之二十三增到百分之二十六。以四川为例，在一九三七年到一九四一年五年中，该省地主地产增加了百分之六十九至七十，而在西康则增加了百分之六十九到百分之七十三，这与孙逸仙三民主义的土地政策是背道而驰的。该报继称：由此产生的农村经济急剧衰落的景象，中国主要输出口之一的生丝，战前每年出口达八万担，今年却只有一万五千担，战前茶产约达一百二十万担，今年才只为三十万担，桐油的情况也同样是惨淡的。
    【新华社延安六日电】据平津各报载：北平等地经国民党当局接收的敌伪仓库中之粮食，全部或大部都已霉烂，先农坛仓库的杂粮，东城仓库的面粉，广安门外仓库的黄豆、玉米、谷子、高粱等，不是肉虫蠢动不忍一睹，便是臭气冲天已成粪堆。北平最大的一个露天仓库广安门外河北省田粮处所辖第四仓库，存粮三万一千余吨，经偷盗露坏，结果所剩无几，据说要给商人拿去酿酒。天津情形更糟，去冬社会局办理冬赈存粮二千余包，经暗地放置于渤海大道五十一小学内已半年有余，至今全部腐臭，该局曾分别通知各报禁载是项消息，并将霉粮昼夜运移怡和粮店，粮店老板要把它作为肥料。
