Economic Crisis in the Kuomintang Areas
Xu Chang

The Kuomintang ruling clique, colluding with comprador and bureaucrat capitalists and imperialist capital, has consistently pursued a reactionary policy of national subjugation and the death of the people.

To maintain dictatorship, suppress the people's democratic revolutionary forces, and launch a civil war, one of their magic weapons is printing money to sustain a huge army. The Tianjin Dagong Bao reported on June 10th (referring to this year, same below): "Finance Minister Yu (referring to Kuomintang Finance Minister Yu Hongjun) first stated... the national support for May was 150,000 billion yuan, while revenue was only 25,000 billion yuan. 125,000 billion was made up by issuing currency." Even the officially announced amount of currency issued this month was so huge; the actual number must be even more staggering. Furthermore, according to the Beiping Xinmin Bao on May 6th, "The number of currency issued, as of now, is 24,000 billion yuan." If we combine the original currency in circulation at the beginning of May with the amount of currency issued during May, we find that the currency issued in May increased by one-half. That is to say, the currency at the beginning of May was two-thirds of the currency at the end of May. In other words, in one month, the Kuomintang reactionaries forcibly stole one-third of the purchasing power of the people to fight the civil war. What could originally buy a sesame cake can now only buy a little more than half – two-thirds.

To wage a civil war, they successively issued orders to "suspend" demobilization transportation, using all transportation tools for military transport, causing goods to be unable to circulate. At the same time, they also monopolized things, leaving many private factories without raw materials. Furthermore, they used various means to seize the vast majority of enterprises. For example, the editorial of the Tianjin Dagong Bao on June 1st stated, "... Roughly estimated, public enterprises account for more than 70% of all industrial capital..." The so-called "public enterprises," under the situation where Kuomintang comprador and bureaucrat capitalists monopolize everything, are actually their private property. However, the style of "encircling without operating" has turned the raw materials and machines of many factories into tools for reselling for profit or left them to rot and rust.

Looking at foreign exchange, the current official price of 2,000 yuan is about 600 times the pre-war level. However, the price index, taking 100 as the base period for 1936, by the beginning of June, the Shanghai daily necessities index was 619,852, an increase of more than 6,000 times; cotton yarn was 540,205, an increase of more than 5,000 times; food was 380,903, an increase of more than 3,800 times (according to statistics from the Shanghai Dagong Bao on June 10th). Saying it increased by 4,000 times is no exaggeration. The difference between 4,000 and 600 means that export commodities, even without accounting for all losses and expenses, would lose five-sixths of their value. Conversely, imports can profit at least five times. On the surface, this seems to encourage and indulge imports, but in reality, it is a dangerous foreign exchange policy for big comprador and bureaucrat capitalists and domestic and foreign fascists to find cheap deals.

In addition, the high prices are a common suffering and extremely familiar to the general public. For example, from the beginning of April to the end of May, the food index (with 100 as the base period for 1936) increased from 266,774 to 444,865 (statistics from the Shanghai Dagong Bao on June 10th), an increase of 66%. Of course, the actual situation is even worse than this.

The Kuomintang area is a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The comprador and bureaucrat reactionaries have always relied on foreign fascist imperialism. In today's century of the people, when the democratic tide is surging, they are frantically and anxiously bringing in that last resort. This is particularly evident in the economy, showing an ugly appearance of wagging its tail and begging.

Looking at Shanghai's foreign trade in the past six months: The import amount in January (in yuan, same below) was 9,382,864,320; in February, 15,173,372,600; in March, 44,208,434,320; in April, 81,510,060,000; in May, 81,378,197,000; in June, over 150,000,000,000, totaling 381,652,882,920. The export amount: in January, 5,641,813,904; in February, 3,308,964,303; in March, 4,462,571,590; in April, 4,883,808,000; in May, 11,105,166,000; in June, approximately 10,000,000,000, totaling 39,402,323,797. Thus, we can see that the import surplus in January was 3,741,050,416 (number published by the customs authorities, as reported by the Shanghai News on May 23rd, same below); in February, 11,864,362,977; in March, 39,745,862,730; in April, 76,626,252,000 (customs news from the Shanghai News on June 15th); in May, 70,273,031,000 (customs news from the Shanghai Dagong Bao on July 21st); in June, approximately 140,000,000,000 (estimated by the Shanghai Dagong Bao on July 4th based on customs news and import and export tax revenue), totaling an import surplus of approximately 342,250,559,123.

In Guangzhou, the import amount in May was 400,000,000; in June, 500,000,000, totaling 900,000,000. The export amount in May was over 30,000,000 yuan; in June, over 20,000,000 yuan, totaling over 50,000,000 yuan. The import surplus in May was approximately 370,000,000 (customs statistics reported by the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on July 9th, same for June), in June, approximately 480,000,000, totaling approximately 850,000,000 (according to the Guangzhou Customs news from the Shanghai News on July 28th, since the restoration, the import of American goods has reached approximately 700 million US dollars).

Here are a few points to explain:

1. The statistics are based on the figures issued by the customs. According to the Kuomintang's "official" practice, the actual number of imports will only be larger than this number, not to mention that, as everyone knows, the current method of importing goods is mostly smuggling and armed escort, without going through customs. For example, the Shanghai News reported on July 28th, "According to Guangzhou Customs news, since the restoration... the American goods smuggled to evade taxes have reached at least 600 million US dollars, this astonishing figure...".

2. The import statistics do not include the amount of imported relief supplies. However, this is a very large quantity.

3. The vast majority of imported goods are American goods, and almost all are consumables. A large part is cosmetics and food that have nothing to do with revitalizing national industry. Even the imported American cotton, coal, and timber only result in the destruction of our country's cotton, coal, and timber production sectors.

4. The official exchange rate of US dollars differs greatly from the black market rate. The price of imported goods is converted into legal tender based on the official rate. If this difference is taken into account, the actual total import surplus should be increased by at least 410,000 million yuan.

In addition, we can see that:

1. Under the collusion of the Kuomintang reactionaries and foreign reactionaries, the number of foreign goods pouring into the country is increasing rapidly. Shanghai's export volume, except for a slight increase in May, shows sluggishness and no improvement. That increased number is small in the overall flood of import surplus. Moreover, under high prices, it is definitely not enough to show an increase in the quantity of exported goods. However, Shanghai's import and import surplus numbers jumped about 17 times and 37 times, respectively, from January to June. The situation in Guangzhou is even worse. Under the high domestic prices, the value of export goods has declined, indicating a significant reduction in the quantity of exported goods.

2. The import surplus in the first half of the year, calculated at 410,000 billion yuan, is approximately 200 million US dollars. If we temporarily disregard all possible influencing factors, such as the restoration and establishment of foreign imperialist "banks," "foreign firms," "factories," etc. in various places, the loss of inland river navigation rights and customs, domestic comprador bureaucrats' individual "companies" and those "cooperating" with the former, and all changes in prices, exchange rates, recession, bankruptcy, purchasing power, etc., and calculate the monthly increase rate of the import surplus in the first half of the year at approximately 2 times, using a geometric series, the import surplus in December will be 82,800 million yuan, and the total import surplus in the second half of the year will reach 163,600 million yuan. Due to the influence of the aforementioned factors in reality, this is certainly not an accurate number, but we can use it to get a glimpse of the dangerous extent. This is only in Shanghai, adding the smuggling amounts in Guangzhou, Tianjin, etc., which is even more alarming! Even the United States, which owns three-quarters of the world's total gold reserves, only has three times that amount (according to the New York Air News International Statistical Bureau estimated in the Beiping Huabei Daily on May 9th, the United States' gold reserve is 2,650,000,000 US dollars).

This is not enough. On the one hand, they are formulating a new Company Law, stipulating that when foreign companies establish branches in China to operate businesses, their parent companies in their home countries do not have to operate (see Articles 7 and 129 of the law). In the draft Banking Law, they also stipulate that foreign banks can accept deposits in our country. These are all to clear the way for compradores and imperialists. On the other hand, they flatteringly hand over the newly recovered inland river navigation rights and customs to foreigners, allowing everything of fascist imperialists to enter and exit our country and inland areas without any restrictions. Even more abominable is that they simply pull in foreign imperialist capital to build factories and manufacture goods domestically, destroying national industry. For example, the Shanghai News reported on May 30th: "...At the same time, the American business community is very concerned about the Chinese market and is seeking to sign contracts with our country to establish companies in our country. It is reported that the famous 'Westinghouse' electric factory has signed a contract with our country to build a large-scale factory in China and is scheduled to hand it over to our country for operation within three years. In addition, there are oil fields, cement plants, ship manufacturing plants, and chemical industry manufacturing plants that have signed contracts with our government or are still under discussion to establish factories in our country..." The so-called "handing over to our country for operation after three years," history tells us, is an insidious lie. For example, the newspaper reported on May 23rd: "London, May 23rd, British News Agency: The Chinese government has signed a contract with British Rolls-Royce Company, so that the company can manufacture engines and jet propulsion engines in China. This company has been approved by the British government... in order to start manufacturing this new machine in China." Others, such as the Three Gorges Hydropower Plant, which will be contracted by the United States, and the Sichuan Railway, which will be jointly built by the United States and France, are numerous! From people's livelihood and light industry to nationwide heavy industrial enterprises, everything will be monopolized by foreigners!

Under this situation where foreign fascist imperialism and Kuomintang fascist reactionaries are colluding and doing harm, national capital is being oppressed and collapsing, factories and mines are closing, workers are unemployed, and commerce is sluggish and closing down. Let's look at the following statistics:

There were originally 3,419 private factories and 636 state-owned factories in Shanghai, totaling 4,055 factories. Of these, 2,597 private factories (accounting for 75%) and 566 state-owned factories (accounting for 89%) closed down, totaling 3,163 factories (accounting for 78%) (above figures are from the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on July 10th).

In Guangzhou, in the cigarette industry alone, there were 99 private and state-owned factories, and over 80 private factories and 2 state-owned factories closed down, totaling approximately 82 factories, accounting for approximately 83% (reported in the Shanghai News on July 19th).

Of the 4,000+ mine units in Sichuan, 1,200 closed down, accounting for 30% (reported in the Beiping Huabei Daily on July 11th).

Almost no iron and steel industry in Chongqing can survive. Of the 642 machinery industries in the first district, only 10+ were partially operating, and 630 closed down, accounting for approximately 98% (Chongqing Business Daily, May 7th, this is calculated based on those participating in the guild). 107 large companies and firms closed down (Tianjin Dagong Bao, July 5th, according to statistics from the Direct Tax Bureau, this is only for May and June).

Of the 80 paper-making, chemical, dyeing, textile, and machinery sectors in Chengdu, 43 closed down, accounting for approximately 54% (Chongqing Xinhua Daily, June 29th, the number of closures includes 25 businesses that ceased operations). Of the 237 cigarette factories, 230 closed down, accounting for 97% (same source).

Of the 72 factories and mines in Yunnan, including 42 private, 10 state-owned, and 20 provincial-operated, 34 closed down, including 23 private (accounting for 55%), 6 state-owned (accounting for 60%), and 5 provincial-operated (accounting for 25%), totaling 34 (accounting for 47%) (all numbers are based on factories and mines participating in the Industrial Association).

Over 90% of the factories in Kunming closed down (estimated by Dr. Xu Peihuang, Chairman of the Yunnan Branch of the China Enterprise Association, reported in the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily on April 15th).

Of the 12 cigarette factories in Nanjing, 10 closed down, and 2 are in a precarious situation (Peace Daily, the Kuomintang military newspaper, July 21st).

Over 80 of the 200+ cigarette factories in Shaoguan closed down (accounting for 40%) (Chongqing Xinhua Daily, June 27th).

Almost all the cigarette factories in Changsha closed down (Shanghai News, July 20th).

Of the 80+ silk factories in Wuxi, 75 closed down (accounting for 94%) (Chongqing Xinhua Daily, July 13th).

The above figures are extremely incomplete, and the actual situation must be much more serious. Also, there is a lack of materials from the north, but their fate is the same!

From south to north, from east to west, from the first-class cities in the east to the small towns in the interior, from machine industry to handicraft industry, from heavy industry to light industry, everything is the same. Even some responsible officials and newspapers of the Kuomintang have to admit the seriousness of the crisis. Most of the factories and mines have closed down, and even the so-called state-owned factories, the embodiment of large comprador and bureaucrat capital that prop up their facade, are no exception. This shows that it has really reached the point of collapse. The stones they lifted have begun to hit their own feet. If things continue like this, they themselves will have no future.

The simultaneous occurrence with the closure of factories and mines is unemployment:

Before the war, there were over 1,000,000 workers in Shanghai, and the number of workers who resumed work was less than 128,000. The number of unemployed or re-employed workers accounted for approximately 87% (Chongqing Xinhua Daily, July 10th).

There were 50,000 unemployed people in Guangzhou (Guangzhou official numbers reported in Chongqing Xinhua Daily, July 10th).

There were 50,000 unemployed people in Kunming, accounting for one-sixth of the city's population (numbers announced by the Yunnan Provincial Government, reported in the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily on April 15th).

There were 100,000 unemployed people in Chengdu (Chongqing Xinhua Daily, June 29th, this number only includes cigarette industry workers and their families).

The above statistics are obviously not enough to represent the unemployment misery that is rampant in the Kuomintang areas. Take Xikuangshan in Hunan, the antimony production area, as an example: "Currently, production in the central area of Xikuangshan, the center of antimony production, has completely come to a standstill. None of the major factories are operating, and over 100,000 miners have been laid off" (Shanghai News, May 24th). Unemployment in this one small area has reached over 100,000 people. The situation in other places can be imagined!

From the above specific numbers and facts, it shows that the viciousness of the Kuomintang and foreign fascist reactionaries and the death of the people are inseparable.

Only by stopping the selling of the nation and the civil war! Implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implementing democracy and peace can the urgent disaster be resolved!

　　国民党区的经济危机
　　徐厂
    国民党统治集团大买办大官僚资本勾结帝国主义资本一直在实行着亡国死民的反动政策。
    为了维持独裁，镇压人民民主革命的力量，发动内战，要维持供应一个极庞大的军队，印发钞票是他们的法宝之一。六月（指本年，下同）十日天津大公报载“俞财长（按指国民党财政部长俞鸿钧）首谓……五月国家支援为一万五千万万元，收入仅为二千五百万万元。一万二千五百万万是用发现弥补。”此月发钞数官方公布的都已如此庞大，事实上的数目一定更骇人听闻。又据五月六日北平新民报载“通货发行数字，截至目前为二万四千亿元。”如果把这五月初原有的通货数量与五月间现钞发行数量放在一起，就知五月份通货增发了二分之一倍。这就是说五月初的货币数为五月底的货币三分之二。换句话说，老百姓在一个月里被国民党反动派强偷了三分之一的购买力去打内战，原来能买一个烧饼，现在祗能买半个多——三分之二了。
    要进行内战，于是接二连三地下命令“暂停”复员运输，把一切交通工具都作了军运，弄得商货不能流通，同时还被垄断，使许多民营工厂无原料可用。再者，他们还用各种办法强占了绝大部分的企业。如六月一日津大公报社论谓“……粗略估计公营事业约占全部产业资本百分之七十以上……”所谓“公营事业”在国民党大买办大官僚资本独揽一切的情形下，其实就是他们的私产。但是“包而不办”的作风，使很多工厂的原料机器都祗作了倒手生利的工具或者是腐烂生锈。
    再看外汇，现今官价二千元约为战前的六百倍。但是物价指数，如以民国二十五年为基期一○○，到六月初，上海日用品指数六一九、八五二，涨了六千多倍，棉纱五四○、二○五，涨了五千多倍，食物三八○、九○三，涨了三千八百多倍（据六月十日沪大公报统计），说涨了四千倍不为夸大。四千与六百之差，使出口商品如不计一切消损用费也得赔六分之五。相反的，进口则最少可得利五倍。这在表面上看来，是鼓励放纵输入，其实是使大买办大官僚国内外法西斯们找便宜的危险的外汇政策。
    此外，物价的高涨是一般人经常身受其苦极其熟悉的事。例如四月初至五月底食物指数（以二十五年为基期一○○）由二六六、七七四升至四四四、八六五（六月十日沪大公报统计），增加了百分之六十六。当然事实上还不祗此。
    国民党区是半殖民地半封建的社会，买办官僚反动派们一向就是依靠外国法西斯帝国主义的。在今天人民世纪里，民主潮流高涨的时候，他们又汗流挟背地急急搬来了那个最后靠山。特别在经济上更显出摇尾乞怜的丑相。
    试看半年来上海的对外贸易：一月份进口数为（以元为单位，下同）九、三八二、八六四、三二○，二月份一五、一七三、三七二、六○，三月份四四、二○八、四三四、三二○，四月份八一、五一○、○六○、○○○，五月份八一、三七八、一九七、○○○，六月份一五○、○○○、○○○、○○○以上，总计为三八一、六五二、八八二、九二○。出口数：一月份为五、六四一、八一三、九○四，三月份三、三○八、九六四、三○三，三月份四、四六二、五七一、五九○，四月份四、八八三、八○八、○○○，五月份一一、一○五、一六六、○○○，六月份约为一○、○○○、○○○、○○○，总计为三九、四○二、三二三、七九七。由此可见一月份入超为三、七四一、○五○、四一六（五月廿三日沪新闻报载海关当局发表数，下同），二月份为一一、八六四、三六二、九七七，三月份为三九、七四五、八六二、七三○，四月份为七六、六二六、二五二、○○○（六月十五日沪新闻报海关消息），五月份七○、二七三、○三一、○○○（七月二十一日沪大公报海关消息），六月份约为一四○、○○○、○○○、○○○（七月四日沪大公报据海关消息由进出口税收估计），总计入超约为三四二、二五○、五五九、一二三。
    在广州五月份进口数为四○○、○○○、○○○，六月份为五○○、○○○、○○○，总计为九○○、○○○、○○○。而五月份出口数为三○、○○○、○○○余元，六月份为二○、○○○、○○○余元，总计为五○、○○○、○○○余元，可见五月份入超约为三七○、○○○、○○○（七月九日渝新华日报载海关统计，六月份同），六月份约为四八○、○○○、○○○，总计约为八五○、○○○、○○○（据七月二十八日沪新闻报粤海关消息，光复以来进口美货约达七亿美元）。
    这里要有几点说明：
    １、统计中是根据海关发出的数字，按照国民党“官方”惯例，进口实数祗会比这个数大，何况如众皆知，现时进口物品多取走私及武装押运的办法，不经过海关。例如七月二十八日沪新闻报载“据粤海关消息，光复以来……而走私漏税之美货，最少亦达六亿美元，此惊人之数字……”。
    ２、统计中进口数不包括进口救济物资额，但是，这是一个很大的数量。
    ３、进口货绝大多数是美货，而且几乎全是消耗品，并且有极大的一部分是与振兴民族工业完全无关的化装品、食品等，就是进口的美棉、煤、木材也都祗有摧毁我国棉、煤、木生产界的结果。
    ４、美金官价与黑市价相差甚巨，而进口货价是以官价折成法币数的，如计及此差额，则总入超实数应最少加到四千一百余万万元。
    此外，我们可以看出：
    １、外货在国民党反动派勾结国外反动派情形之下，拥进国内的数目在飞跃地增加着。上海出口额，除五月略有增加外，其余皆表现疲滞毫无起色，那增加的数字在整个入超的洪流里，本属小，何况在物价高涨下，决不足以表现出口物品量的增加呢。但是上海进口和入超数由一月到六月，则分别跳高了约十七倍和三十七倍。广州的情形更坏，出口货在国内物价高涨下，货值数字反而下降，这表示出口物品量的大大减少。
    ２、上半年的入超数，如按四千一百亿计，约合美金二亿元。如果姑且把一切可能影响的因素，如国外帝国主义在各地“银行”、“洋行”、“工厂”等的恢复和成立，内河航行权海关的丧失，国内买办官僚单独的以及与前者“合作”的“公司”，物价汇率萧条倒闭破产购买力等一切变动，暂不计及，以上半年每月入超增加率约为二倍计算，以等比级数衡之，十二月份入超将为八万二千八百万万元，下半年总入超数将达十六万三千六百万万元。由于事实上前述各种因素的影响，这当然不是个正确的数字，不过我们可以借此稍稍看出其危险的程度。这祗是上海一地，加上广州天津等等地方以及走私数额，那就更加惊人！就是拥有全世界黄金总量四分之三的美国也祗有该数的三倍金额，（据北平华北日报五月九日载纽约航讯国际统计局估计，美国存金量为二、六五○、○○○万美元）。
    这还不够，他们一方面制定新公司法，规定着外国公司在中国设分公司经营企业时，其本国之母公司可以不营业（见该法第七条及一百二十九条）在银行法草案上，又规定着外国银行可以在我国吸收存款，这些都是替买办们及帝国主义打冲锋。另一方面，又谄媚地把刚收复的内河航行权及海关双手捧送外人，使法西斯帝国主义者的一切不受任何约束地进出我国境及内地。更可恶的是，他们索性拉外国帝国主义资本来国内单独建厂制造，摧毁民族工业。如五月三十日沪新闻报载称：“……同时美国工商业界方面对于我国市场颇予关切，纷谋与我国订立合同，在我国国内设立公司。据悉：著名之‘威斯汀好斯’电器厂已与我国签订合同决在华境内建立大规模之工厂，并预定三年内交与我国经营。此外，已与我国政府签定合同或尚在讨论中，在我国设厂者，计有石油场，水泥场，轮船制造厂及化学工业制造厂……”所谓“三年后交与我国经营”，历史告诉我们，这是阴险的谎话。又如五月廿三日该报称：“英国新闻处伦敦廿三日电：中国政府已与英国洛尔斯洛益公司订立合同，俾该公司得于中国制造引擎与喷射推进引擎。此项公司既已为英国政府核准……以便在中国开始制造此新机器。”其他如三峡水力发电厂的将由美国包办，四川铁路的将由美法合资建筑等等不一而足！由民生轻工业到有全国性的重工业企业都将为外人一手独揽！
    在这种外国法西斯帝国主义与国民党法西斯反动派狼狈为害的情况下，民族资本被压迫得垮台，厂矿倒闭，工人失业，商业萧条歇业。我们看看下面这些统计数字：
    上海原有民营工厂三、四一九家，国营工厂六三六家共计四、○五五家，而倒闭的民营二、五九七家，（占百分之七五）国营五六六家（占百分之八九）共三、一六三家，（占百分之七八），（以上数字载七月十日渝新华日报）。
    广州单卷烟业一项，民营国营工厂共九九家而倒闭的民营八○余家，国营二家，总计约八二家，约占百分之八三，（载七月十九日沪新闻报）。
    四川矿厂四、○○○余单位，倒闭的则为一、二○○家，占百分之三○，（载七月十一日北平华北日报）。
    重庆钢铁业几乎没有一家可以生存，第一区机器业六四二家，部分开工的仅一○余家，而倒闭则为六三○家，约占百分之九八，（五月七日渝商务日报，此系就参加公会者计算）大公司行号倒闭一○七家（七月五日天津大公报据直接税局之统计，此仅为五、六两月份者）。
    成都制纸化学染织机械等部门共八○家，倒闭四三家，约占百分之五四（六月二十九日渝新华日报，倒闭数包括歇业二五家），纸烟厂二三七家，倒闭二三○家，占百分之九七，（来源同上）。
    云南厂矿民营四二家，国营一○家，省营二○家，共计七二家，而倒闭的民营二三家（占百分之五五），国营六家（占百分之六○），省营五家（占百分之二五），共三四家（占百分之四七）（各数均以参加工业协会之厂矿为计算基准）。
    昆明工厂倒闭百分之九○以上（据中国企业协会滇分会长徐佩璜博士估计，载四月十五日晋察冀日报）。
    南京烟厂一二家，倒闭一○家，形势危殆者二，（七月二十一日国民党军方报纸和平日报）。
    韶关烟厂二○○余家，倒闭八○余家，（占百分之四○）（六月二十七日渝新华日报）。
    长沙烟厂，几乎全部倒闭、（七月二十日沪新闻报）。
    无锡丝厂八○余家，倒闭七五家，（占百分之九四）（七月十三日渝新华日报）。
    以上各种数字极不完全，事实一定还要严重的多。并且缺少北方的材料，可是其命运是一样的！
    从南到北从东到西，从东方头等大城到内地小镇，从机器工业到手工业，从重工业到轻工业，全都一样，就连国民党有些负责的官员及其报纸也不得不承认危机的严重。各种厂矿企业已倒闭了大部分，甚至大买办大官僚资本的化身替他们撑门面的所谓国营工厂也不能例外。这说明，实在是已到崩溃的时候，他们搬起的石头已经开始打在自己的脚上，像这样下去，他们自己也将是毫无前途可言的。
    与厂矿倒闭同时发生的就是失业：
    上海战前工人为一、○○○、○○○人以上，而复工人数不及一二八、○○○、失业或转业人数约占百分之八七：（七月十日渝新华日报）。
    广州失业人数五○、○○○人，（七月十日渝新华日报载广州官方公布数）。
    昆明失业人数五○、○○○，占全市人口六分之一，（四月十五日晋察冀日报载滇省政府公布数字）。
    成都失业人数一○○、○○○，（六月二十九日渝新华日报，此数字只包括卷烟业工人及其眷属）。
    上面的统计数字显然不足以表现遍及国民党区的失业惨状，单以湖南锑产地锡矿山来说吧，“锡矿山产锑中心地带目前生产已全部陷于停顿状态，主要各厂无一家开工，十余万矿工均告失业”，（五月二十四日沪新闻报）此一小区失业即达十余万人，其他各地可想而知！
    从以上的具体数字和事实，说明了国民党和国外法西斯反动派的毒辣与人民的死亡是不可分的。
    祗有停止卖国内战！实行政协决议，实行民主和平，才能解救这然眉之祸！
