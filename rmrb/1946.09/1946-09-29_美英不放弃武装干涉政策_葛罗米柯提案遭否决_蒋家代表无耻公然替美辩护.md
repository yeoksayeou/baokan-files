　　US, UK Refuse to Abandon Armed Intervention Policy
　　Gromyko Proposal Rejected
　　Chiang Kai-shek's Representative Shamelessly Defends US Publicly
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th] New York Dispatch: On September 24th, after Gromyko issued a lengthy statement requesting all UN members to report their foreign troops stationed abroad, the Security Council began debating whether the Soviet representative's proposal should be included on the agenda. The Polish representative supported including this proposal on the agenda. The French representative stated that he had no objections. The Egyptian representative stated in his speech that Egypt was currently negotiating with the British regarding the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. If these negotiations failed, Egypt would appeal to the Security Council. The representative of the Nanjing government opposed including the Soviet proposal on the agenda and defended the US military's presence in China as being at the request of the Nanjing government. The US representative believed that foreign troops stationed abroad were unrelated to the UN Charter. The British representative also echoed this sentiment. The Soviet representative Gromyko retorted that the Security Council has the power to take measures to maintain peace and certainly has the power to gather intelligence. Article 34 of Chapter 6 of the UN Charter stipulates that "The Security Council may investigate any dispute, or any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute." During the vote, the Soviet Union and Poland voted in favor, France and Egypt abstained, and the United States, China, Britain, Australia, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Brazil, seven countries in total, opposed it, and the Soviet proposal was rejected.

　　葛罗米柯提案遭否决
　　蒋家代表无耻公然替美辩护
    【新华社延安二十六日电】纽约讯：九月二十四日在葛罗米柯发表长篇声明要求联合国各会员报告其国外驻军后，安理会即开始辩论苏代表这一提案是否应列入议程。波代表赞成将这一提案列入议程，法代表声明他没有意见，埃及代表于发言中提出埃及现正与英方谈判英军自埃撤退问题，若此项谈判失败，则埃及将向安理会声诉。南京政府代表则反对将苏方提案列入议程，并辩护美军驻华乃南京政府之请。美代表则认为外国驻军与联合国宪章无关。英代表亦附和。苏代表葛罗米柯反驳称：安理会有权采取维持和平之措施，自更有权采取情报。联合国宪章第六章第三十四条规定“安理会得调查任何争端或可能引起国际磨擦或引起争端之任何情势”。表决时苏波两国投赞成票，法埃两国弃权，美中英澳墨荷及巴西七国反对，苏方提案竟遭否决。
