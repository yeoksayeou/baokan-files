The Kuomintang Reactionaries' Atrocities Against the Press Since the Political Consultative Conference
　　Our Newspaper Archives

　　When Chiang Kai-shek attended the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year, he announced four promises, guaranteeing the people's freedom of person, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. These democratic freedoms that the people should enjoy were also more clearly stipulated in the solemn resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, the deceitful and untrustworthy traitor and dictator Chiang Kai-shek broke his promises, tore up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and persisted in his reactionary policy of national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war. On the one hand, he launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas; on the other hand, he intensified the fascist terror rule in his controlled areas. He carried out unprecedented destruction and strangulation of the press, which spoke out righteously and called for independence, democracy, and peace. The following is a list of the reactionary measures and atrocities that the Kuomintang reactionaries have inflicted on the democratic press since the Political Consultative Conference:

　　January 12　Renowned journalist and military commentator Yang Zao (Yang Chao) was tortured and poisoned to death by Kuomintang secret agents in Hangzhou prison.

　　January 12　The Shanghai English-language *China Weekly Review* published an editorial opposing the Kuomintang authorities' control of public opinion, stating that the newspaper had received a notice from the post office that it could not be delivered anywhere except Chongqing.

　　January 16　The Chongqing *Xinhua Daily* reported that freedom of press distribution was still lacking, and the Kunming post office continued to detain the newspaper.

　　January 24 evening　Li Xuemin, a reporter from the press department of the Chongqing Political Advancement Conference, was severely beaten by secret agents near the "Spiritual Fortress," suffering serious head and waist injuries.

　　February 10　The celebration of the success of the Political Consultative Conference in Jiaochangkou, Chongqing, was sabotaged by secret agents and thugs. *Xinmin Daily* reporters Yao Jiangping and Deng Shusheng, *Dagong Daily* reporter Gao Xuekui, and *Shangwu Daily* reporter Liang Kejun were all beaten by secret agents.

　　February 22　Secret agents and thugs destroyed the Chongqing *Xinhua Daily* business department, and the business department director Yang Liyuan and staff member Xu Manjun were seriously injured. Losses amounted to 100 million yuan. At the same time, the business department of the Democratic League's organ, *Democratic Daily*, was also destroyed, and five staff members were injured.

　　March 1　The Xi'an *Qinfeng Daily* and *Gongshang Daily* joint office were suddenly destroyed by secret agents, with losses exceeding 2 million yuan.

　　March 3　The Beiping Municipal Social Bureau ordered that articles, magazines, and news agencies not approved were not allowed to be distributed.

　　March 18　The two million people of Nantong welcomed the Huaiyin Executive Group, but the grand parade was obstructed by secret agents. *Minguo Daily* reporter Sun Ping was missing and later murdered by secret agents.

　　April 3　The editorial offices of the *Beiping Liberation Daily* and the Xinhua Branch were illegally searched by Kuomintang military police and secret agents, and 45 people including the president Qian Junrui were arrested. After serious protests and struggles, they were released. After Qian and others were released, they immediately paraded through the city, set off firecrackers, and shouted slogans. The masses cheered and applauded along the way, celebrating their regaining of freedom, and groups went to the *Liberation Daily* to express their condolences.

　　April 19　The Beiping National Assembly Representatives Election Promotion Association held a speech meeting on the National Assembly Representative election issue in Zhongshan Park, which was disrupted by secret agents. Professor Chen Jinkun and the head of the US Information Service, Mr. Foster, were both beaten. Mr. Foster said to the secret agents: "I have been in China for twelve years, this is the first time I have been beaten."

　　April 19　Yang Guiqing, a reporter for the Xi'an *Gongshang Daily*, was attacked by secret agents on his way home from the newspaper office in the early morning, almost losing his life.

　　April 20　The branch offices of the Guangzhou *Huashang Daily* and *Zheng Daily* were destroyed by secret agents one after another.

　　April 22　Kuomintang secret agents destroyed the *Minzhong Shibao* (People's Voice) office of the Democratic League in Chengdu, and openly clamored: "Nothing is untouchable, even Zhang Lan will be beaten here."

　　April 30　Li Furen, editor of the Xi'an *Minzhong Daobao* (People's Guide), was murdered by secret agents (Li was rescued after being killed and has now fled to Yan'an).

　　May 3　The Xi'an *Qinfeng Gongshang Daily* was forced to cease publication, and was surrounded by secret agents two days before its closure.

　　May 25　The Shanghai *Wenhui Weekly* was forced to cease publication for publishing an editorial denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy and crimes in the Nantong massacre.

　　July 6　The Changsha *Li Bao* published news of the "Establishment of military communication groups by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense in various places."
