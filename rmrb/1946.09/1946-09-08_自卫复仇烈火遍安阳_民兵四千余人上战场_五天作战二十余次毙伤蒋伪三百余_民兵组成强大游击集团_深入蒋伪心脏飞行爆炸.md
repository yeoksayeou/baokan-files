　　Self-Defense and Revenge Blaze Across Anyang
    Over 4,000 Militiamen Go to the Battlefield
    Killing or Wounding Over 300 Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Troops in Over 20 Battles in Five Days
    Militiamen Form Powerful Guerrilla Groups
    Flying Explosions Deep Into the Heart of Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Regime
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, 7th dispatch] After the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops occupied Qu Gou and other places in Anyang, a wave of self-defense and revenge swept across the entire Anyang county. The first batch of participants in the county's ten districts included fifteen militia companies and five district cadre teams, totaling over 4,000 people. The militia expedition teams from Wu'an, Shexian, and Cixian counties supporting the Yubei border area comprised six combat companies and one demolition company, totaling over 500 people, who successively rushed to the front lines. Upon hearing the news that the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops had invaded Qu Gou, the liberated farmers in the old areas automatically organized stretcher teams of over a thousand people and transportation teams of five thousand people, ready to be dispatched to the front lines at any time to provide medical assistance and military supplies. On August 29th, amidst the continuous sound of artillery fire, this reporter stepped into the key town of Shuiye in Anyang, where a team of strong militiamen, armed with guns and ammunition, was singing songs of liberation and self-defense as they marched through the center of the street towards the front lines. Refugees who had fled from the Chiang Kai-shek puppet-occupied areas witnessed them carrying various types of pull mines, step mines, rolling mines, and mother-and-son mines, hurrying past. An old woman with a cane said excitedly: "Go! Drive away those 'ashes' and save the people who haven't escaped. The east is without sky!" On the morning of August 30th, this reporter visited the person in charge of the Anyang front command somewhere in the front. It was reported that the 5,000 militiamen who had entered the front lines had joined with our main forces, backbone teams, and armed work teams to form × powerful guerrilla groups, launching a mass self-defense guerrilla war against Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets. The militiamen in the villages occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppets in the fifth and eighth districts also jointly organized self-defense and home protection, in addition to adhering to the frontline struggle against the stubborn enemy, and also carrying out explosion campaigns and night raids in the heart of the stubborn enemy's grid network of strongholds and trenches. On the night of the 27th, the militiamen in the occupied areas of the fifth and eighth districts, for the first time, penetrated the densely mined areas of the east and west Chai Ku villages, harvested several miles of electric wire, and raided Shang Zhuang to destroy the stubborn enemy's puppet regime, killing two secret agents on the spot. The first and second groups of the second district's flying explosion team, with rapid action, sneaked into the outside of the west Gou and Chenjia Jing villages to lay mines. That night, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet mobile sentries stepped on six giant mines twice, causing dozens of casualties. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the village were awakened from their dreams in panic and fired wildly with machine guns for three hours, daring not to sleep all night. Due to the unpredictable guerrilla activities of our militiamen in the heartland of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops were uneasy and deeply exhausted, and the fierce flames of small-scale frantic raids have been severely挫败. On the 28th, the 318th Regiment of the 40th Division of Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet home-returning corps, totaling over 500 people, invaded our Juan Li village. Our militiamen, together with a small part of the main force, only about a hundred people, fought fiercely with Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets outside the village, repelling their several charges with hand grenades, killing or wounding over 30 stubborn puppets, while we only suffered three casualties. On the 28th, the militiamen of the × district attacked the Hong Yan stronghold. Wang Rongfa, a liberated hero militiaman from Xi Gaoping, carried six hand grenades and rushed into the village first, followed by a swarm of militiamen, shouting in unison. The Chiang Kai-shek troops, unable to resist, fled eastward in panic. Since then, our militiamen's prestige has greatly increased, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops flee at the first strike every time they raid. According to incomplete statistics, from the 27th to the 31st, in five days, the Anyang militiamen fought more than twenty battles, killing or wounding over two hundred Chiang Kai-shek troops. At present, the militiamen in each district have successively launched challenges and launched a self-defense competition for new heroism.

　　自卫复仇烈火遍安阳
    民兵四千余人上战场
    五天作战二十余次毙伤蒋伪三百余
    民兵组成强大游击集团
    深入蒋伪心脏飞行爆炸
    【本报长治七日讯】蒋伪军陷我安阳曲沟等地后，安阳全县普遍燃起自卫复仇的烈火。全县十个区首批参战者已有十五个民兵连，和五个区干队共四千余人，武安、涉县、磁县支援豫北边地的民兵远征队已有六个战斗连，一个爆炸连，共五百余人相继奔赴前线。广大老区翻身农民听到蒋伪军侵占我曲沟消息后，自动组织千余人的担架队、五千人的运输队，随时准备出动前线担任救护及军需供应工作。八月二十九日在连天的炮火声中，记者踏进安阳重镇水冶街头，正有一队壮健的民兵，荷枪实弹，唱着翻身自卫的歌曲穿过街心，向前线开进，由蒋伪侵占区逃来的难民目睹他们抬着各色各样的拉雷、踏雷、滚雷、母子雷，匆匆地走过。一个手拿拐杖的老太太激动的说：“去吧！把那些‘烧灰’们赶走，救救没逃脱的人们，东边没有天了啊！”三十日上午记者复于前方某地访问安阳前方指挥部负责人，据称：进入前线的五千民兵，已结合我主力部队、基干队、武工队等组成×个强大的游击集团，向蒋伪展开群众性的自卫游击战。五、八两区蒋伪占领村庄的民兵，亦协同组织自卫保家联防，除坚持边地正面的对顽斗争外，并深入蒋伪据点林立、沟墙纵横的格子网内，开展顽伪心脏中的爆炸运动及夜摸战。五、八区蒋伪侵占区民兵于二十七日夜曾首次深入东西柴库村密布地雷阵后，收割电线数里，并摸进上庄摧毁顽伪政权，当场打掉特务两名，二区飞行爆炸组一、二两组以神速的行动摸到西沟、陈家井两村外布雷，当夜蒋伪游动哨两次踏响巨雷六个，伤亡数十人，村内蒋伪仓皇从梦中惊醒以机步枪乱射达三小时，一夜未敢入睡。由于我民兵在蒋伪心脏地带上神出鬼没的游击活动，蒋伪军睡卧不安，深感疲惫，小股疯狂出扰的凶焰已遭受重挫。二十八日蒋伪四十师三一八团及伪还乡团共五百余人进犯我卷里村，我民兵配合主力小部仅百余人于该村村外与蒋伪激战，以手榴弹击退其数次冲锋，毙伤顽伪三十余人，我仅伤亡三人。二十八日×区民兵袭洪岩据点，西高平翻身英雄民兵王荣法携带六颗手掷弹，首先冲进村内后续民兵蜂涌跟进，喊声连天，蒋军未及还击，仓皇东窜。自是我民兵声威大震，蒋军每次出扰，均一击即逃。据不完全统计，自二十七日起到三十一日五天中，安阳民兵大小战斗二十余次，毙伤蒋伪军二百余人。现各区民兵均纷纷提出挑战，展开新英雄主义运动的自卫竞赛。
