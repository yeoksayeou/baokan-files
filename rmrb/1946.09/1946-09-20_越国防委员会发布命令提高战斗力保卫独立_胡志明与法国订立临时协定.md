　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 16th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam Supreme National Defense Committee issued an order on the anniversary of Vietnam's independence (September 2nd), calling on the nation to maintain and enhance combat power to defend the country's independence. The order stated: "On this day last year, the first government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed, and since then, Vietnam has become a free and independent country." It further stated: "The struggle of the past year has laid the foundation for our people's independence, and thanks to our unity and cooperation, we have safeguarded our sovereignty and territorial integrity." Pointing out that the enemies of the People's Republic of Vietnam are attempting to nullify the fruits of the Vietnamese people's struggle, the order called for: (1) All members of the national army must enforce stricter discipline, enrich their combat knowledge, and maintain a good fighting spirit. (2) Senior commanders must make it their mission to enhance the combat effectiveness of the army, fully grasp staff work, and strengthen the coordination of supply and political work. (3) All militia must make greater efforts to learn military techniques and abide by discipline. (4) Soldiers and civilians must maintain their combat potential and protect the honor of the people and the army.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 17th: Comprehensive report: Following the departure of the Vietnamese delegation from France to return to Vietnam, the Chairman of the Vietnamese Government, Ho Chi Minh, also left France on the 16th to return home. Ho Chi Minh stayed in France for a few more days to conclude a provisional agreement with France to avoid a complete breakdown of negotiations and the expansion of the Franco-Vietnamese war. According to Reuters: The provisional agreement was announced in Paris on the 15th, in which, apart from Vietnam agreeing to France retaining certain economic and cultural interests in Vietnam, fundamental issues such as the degree of autonomy of Vietnam and the issue of Cochinchina were not resolved. The Vietnamese side demanded that France recognize Vietnam's independence and sovereignty, while the French side only allowed a status even less than that of a dominion. The agreement decided to submit this issue to a special committee for preliminary discussion, and negotiations would be reopened after the French constitution was ratified. The French Foreign Ministry stated on the 16th that a precise agreement on issues such as the degree of Vietnam's autonomy could only be formulated after the French constitution stipulated the French political system. According to reports, the three ruling parties in France, the Popular Republican Movement, the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party, have different views on the degree of Vietnam's autonomy, and it will not be possible to know which one will represent the views of the French government until the constitution is ratified.

　　越国防委员会发布命令
    提高战斗力保卫独立
    胡志明与法国订立临时协定
    【新华社延安十六日电】据越南通讯社讯：越南最高国防委员会于越南独立一周年纪念（九月二日）发布命令，号召全国保持并提高战斗力，保卫国家的独立。该命令称：“去年今日越南民主共和国第一届政府宣告成立，从此越南成为自由独立的国家。”并称：“过去一年的斗争，已使我国人民打下了独立的基础，由于我们的团结合作，保卫了我国的主权与领土的完整。”在指出越南人民共和国的敌人正图使越南人民斗争的果实化为乌有后，该命令号召：（一）全国军队的一切成员必须更加严明纪律，充实作战知识，保持良好的战斗精神。（二）高级指挥官必须以提高军队战斗力为他们的任务，充分掌握参谋工作，加强供应工作及政治工作的配合。（三）一切民兵必须作更大努力，学习军事技术和遵守纪律。（四）军民必须保持他们的战斗潜力，保护人民和军队的荣誉。
    【新华社延安十七日电】综合报导：继越南代表团离法返越之后，越南政府主席胡志明亦于十六日离法返国。胡志明在法多逗留几天的目，在与法国订立一临时协定，以避免谈判的完全破裂，影响到法越战事的扩大。据路透社讯：该临时协定已于十五日在巴黎公布，其中除越南答应法国在越南保有若干经济与文化利益外，基本问题如越南的自治程度及交趾支那问题均未解决。越南方面要求法国承认越南的独立自主，法国方面则只允予连自治领还不如的地位。协定决定将此问题提交一专门委员会进行初步讨论，待法国宪法复决以后再重开谈判。法外交部十六日称：因为对越南自治程度等问题的确切协定，须在法国宪法规定了法国的政制以后才能制订。按法国三执政党为人民共和运动党、共产党与社会党，对越南自治程度的主张均有不同，在宪法复决以前将无法确知孰将代表法政府的意见。
