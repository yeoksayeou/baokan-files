[This newspaper, Weixian, 18th] In the past, Zaoqiang's work of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and those resisting Japan was not good, which affected the consolidation of the army and the relations between the army and the people. In order to support the patriotic self-defense war, the county has specifically set out a set of measures to change the way military dependents are treated preferentially, so that the soldiers at the front can fight with peace of mind. The basic spirit of this method is: first, to get through the masses' thinking, convene a "thinking meeting" to make everyone truly realize that this is to protect their own fruits of liberation. At the same time, establish district and village committees to give preferential treatment to military dependents and two organizations of military dependents' representatives, closely combine mass movements, and effectively solve all the difficulties of military dependents. For every eight mu of land, the masses will cultivate one mu on behalf of them. In villages with many military dependents, the burden exceeding the number will be adjusted by labor from other villages, or short-term workers will be hired on behalf of them, and the wages will be borne by the villages that should provide labor. Preferential treatment measures are also stipulated for the burden of labor. The old, weak, orphans, and disabled below the middle peasants and the main leaders of the government, people, and military do not provide labor. Men between the ages of 18 and 50 cultivate one mu on behalf of every eight mu. Cadres and militiamen are given appropriate care and the output is determined according to the quality of the land and fertilizer. If the harvest decreases, the cultivating households will compensate.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 17th: With the enthusiastic care and help of the government and the masses, the families of the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters are living a better life. In Zhangbei County, more than 400 of the 487 military families have risen to the level of middle peasants. In the urban area of Huailai, all 110 military families have escaped poverty and risen to the level of middle peasants. In Yixian County, the lives of 44 military families in various districts and many honorary soldiers have been greatly improved. In villages like Kong and Zhiquan, the average per capita cultivated land for 42 military families has increased from more than one mu to more than two mu, and the harvest is enough for food and there is a surplus. In Zheng Goubao Villages 7, 8, and 9 in Huai'an, 169 military families have purchased an average of one mu of paddy fields per person, and have generally established self-sufficient households. The masses in various places have created various methods to help military families produce and establish households: (1) Allocate the assets of the liquidation of traitors and puppets to military families lacking land for cultivation. Enlightened gentry and wealthy cadres also donate part of the land to military families. For example, Li Xingguo, the village chief of Dadi Village in the Sixth District of Yixian County, first donated ten mu of land, and influenced the entire village to donate 128 mu of land. The district also mobilized the masses to donate equipment and labor to build more than 130 houses for military families. (2) Absorb military dependents who lack labor to participate in the labor allocation team, and various rural areas assist in cultivation. For widowed and lonely military dependents who have no labor force at all, all implement compulsory contracted farming. The masses also automatically accumulate manure for military dependents. For example, in Luo Village in the Eighth District of Huai, this year a total of 25,000 kilograms of fertilizer were donated to military dependents, and four mu of vegetable gardens were opened to supply military dependents with vegetables all year round. The masses in various villages loaned 2,350 kilograms of interest-free loans to poor military dependents for cultivation, and raised funds to purchase two oxen specifically to help military dependents cultivate the land. The cadres of Luo Xiao Village borrowed 20,000 yuan as shares for military dependents to join the cooperative, and used the dividends as education expenses for the children of military dependents. (3) Widely collect supplies to help military dependents overcome disasters in the severe winter, spring famine, and the season when old crops are gone but new crops have not yet matured.
