Mid- and Lower-Level Officials in Thirteen Provinces Unable to Survive; Widespread Wage Increase Strikes Erupt
Nanjing: Over Ten Thousand Civil Servants Sign Petition Demanding Improved Treatment

[This Newspaper Report] Comprehensive reports: Under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, even the mid- and lower-level officials in the Kuomintang governments at all levels are unable to survive. As of the end of June, wage increase strike movements had erupted in more than 100 cities in thirteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and Shandong. Civil servants in all departments, from administrative to judicial, from central, provincial, and municipal to county levels, have been swept into the movement like a tide. As this movement spread and public opinion widely sympathized with them, the Legislative Yuan formulated the "Salary Adjustment Measures" in mid-May. At that time, prices had risen to 5,000 to 10,000 times, or even 30,000 times, pre-war levels. The measures stipulated that salaries be increased by 1,000 times the pre-war salary, plus a living allowance of 200,000, but the Executive Yuan refused to comply, causing disputes between the two houses, and further inciting widespread resistance from public school employees in various regions. From June 1st to 7th, all judges of the Nanjing Supreme Court went on strike for a week. Subsequently, staff of the Jiangsu Higher Court and subordinate agencies in Suzhou also went on a major strike. Public school employees in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang and other places also took mass leave. The Higher Court and District Court of Guangzhou, the District Court of Beiping, the Higher Court of Henan and the Anyang District Court of Henan simultaneously went on strike. Judges and staff of the Sichuan Higher Court, and the Chongqing, Neijiang, and Guanghan District Courts even went on "strike from trials" in mid-June. Except for a few key officials such as Li Pinsian, the rest of the Anhui Provincial Government went on a general strike on June 9th. All mid- and lower-level staff of the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Government, including staff of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League Zhejiang Branch, a total of more than 2,000 people, also took mass leave in early June. The Kuomintang authorities, shocked by this uproar, had the National Defense Supreme Committee transfer the "Regional Treatment Adjustment Measures" proposed by the Executive Yuan to Chiang Kai-shek in early June, deciding to implement them from June. The measures were far below the "Adjustment Measures" proposed by the Legislative Yuan, so the standard caused an uproar among civil servants in various provinces after its announcement. More than 10,000 mid- and lower-level staff from various Nanjing academies, ministries, and commissions first launched a signature campaign in the Legislative Yuan, submitting a letter to Chiang Kai-shek and the seven Yuan heads on June 21, requesting improved treatment. More than 1,000 civil servants of the Jiangsu Provincial Government took mass leave on June 10 and submitted a letter to Chiang Kai-shek making the same request. Centering on Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, county-level civil servants from more than 30 counties including Chengdu, Guanghan, and Huayang, formed a "Petition Group Demanding Equal Treatment" in mid-June, proposing to the Kuomintang Central Committee that there should be equal treatment regardless of whether they are central or local employees. Staff of the Bengbu and Wuhu Higher Courts of the Anhui Provincial Government, the Wuhu and Dangtu county governments and other agencies, staff of the Hubei Provincial Government and agencies under the Ministry of Finance in Wuhan, staff of the Wuchang District Court, staff of the Tianjin Municipal Government, and staff of the Guangxi and Yunnan Provincial Governments, all launched go-slows, strikes, "resignation," parades and other movements, demanding a re-adjustment of treatment and pay increases. In Guizhou, even the Provincial Chairman Yang Sen and the Kuomintang Provincial Party Headquarters Director Guan Bomin proposed that the treatment be based on the Chongqing area standard, while the provincial government staff passed a telegram to the Executive Yuan. This extensive movement directly threatened the work of the Kuomintang government agencies, so the "National Defense Supreme Committee" re-issued a new standard, which was slightly increased from before, but the highest amount, such as in Dihua, was still only an increase of 120,000 in base pay and an increase of 750 times in salary. In Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, it was 110,000 and 720 times. In Guizhou and other places, the lowest was 50,000 and 320 times. It is obvious that these measures have not yet solved the livelihood problems of public school employees.

　　十三省中下级官员无法生活
    普遍掀起增薪罢工运动
    南京万余公务人员签名要求改善待遇
    【本报讯】综合报导：在国民党反动派黑暗统治下，甚至连国民党各级政府中的中下级官员，也因无法生活，截至六月底止，已掀起普及江、浙、闽、粤、鄂、皖、川、滇、黔、陕、晋、冀、鲁等十三省一百多个城市的增薪罢工运动。各部门的公务人员，从行政到司法，从中央、省、市到县，都像潮水般卷入到运动中。在此运动日益蔓延与社会舆论广泛同情下，立法院于五月中旬制定了“调整薪津办法”。当时物价已涨至战前之五千倍到一万倍，乃至三万倍。该办法规定按战前薪水加一千倍，外加生活基数二十万，而行政院尚不照办，引起两院争执，并因此更激起各地公教人员广泛的抗争。六月一日至七日，南京最高法院全体推事首先罢工一星期。接着苏州江苏高等法院以下机关职员又实行大罢工，京、沪、无锡、常熟、松江等地公教人员亦纷起总请假。广州高等法院及地方法院、北平地方法院、河南高等法院与河南安阳地方法院同时纷起罢工。四川高等法院、重庆、内江、广汉地方法院全体法官员工，更于六月中旬先后“罢审”。安徽省政府除李品仙等几个主要负责人外，余均于六月九日举行总罢工。杭州浙江省府全体中下级职员，甚至包括三青团浙江支团部职员共二千余人，亦于六月初旬一律总请假。国民党当局被这轩然大波所震慑乃于六月初旬由国民党国防最高委员会将行政院所提“分区调整待遇办法”转交蒋介石，决定于六月份起实行，该办法远低于立法院所提“调整办法”，故标准公布后，各省公务人员大哗。南京各院、部会中下级职员一万余人，由立法院首先发动签名运动，于六月二十一日上书蒋介石及七院院长，请求改善待遇。江苏省府全体公务员一千余人，六月十日总请假，并上书蒋介石作同样请求。四川以省会成都为中心，六月中旬由成都、广汉、华阳等三十余县县级公务员成立“要求平等待遇请愿团”，向国民党中央提出不分中央与地方，一律平等待遇之要求。安徽省政府蚌埠及芜湖两高等法院、芜湖、当涂两县县府及其他机关职员，湖北省省政府及武汉财政部所属机关、武昌地方法院等职员、天津市政府职员、广西及云南省政府职员，均纷纷作怠工、罢工、“挂冠”、游行等运动，要求重新调整待遇和加薪。贵州甚至由省主席杨森、国民党省党部主任委员关伯敏等提出照重庆区标准待遇，而由省府职员通过电述行政院。这样广大的运动直接威胁着国民党政府机关的工作，因此“国防最高委员会”又重新发布新标准，较前略有增加，但最高额如迪化等地，亦不过增基数为十二万，加薪七百五十倍。京沪等地为十一万与七百二十倍。贵州等地最低为五万与三百二十倍。此种措施目前并未能解决公教人员生活问题是显然的。
