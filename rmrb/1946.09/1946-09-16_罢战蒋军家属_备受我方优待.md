　　Families of Chiang Soldiers Who Cease Fighting Are Treated Favorably by Our Side
　　[Report from our newspaper in Heze on the 12th] The families of Chiang soldiers who were liberated here during the Jilu豫 counter-offensive war have received excellent treatment from our army. Zhen Suzhen, the wife of Li Yunsa, deputy battalion commander of the 2nd battalion of the 3rd regiment of the Aviation Special Service Brigade of the Chiang Army Aviation Committee, gave birth on August 24th. Our military had arranged for a midwife to deliver the baby in advance. In accordance with the Border Region's regulations on preferential treatment for maternity, she was issued cloth, cotton, grain, vegetable money, and recuperation expenses. Now both mother and child are very healthy and comfortable. The remaining ten Chiang soldier family members who are staying here, whose husbands are studying in the officers' training regiment, can visit them from time to time. Their lives are all being treated favorably, and they express extreme gratitude.

　　罢战蒋军家属
    备受我方优待
    【本报荷泽十二日电】冀鲁豫反击战中解放来此的蒋军家属备受我军优待，蒋军航委会航空特务旅三团二营副营长李运洒之妻甄素贞，八月二十四日生产，我军事先就替她雇了接生婆收生。并按照边区干部优待产妇条例，发给布匹棉花，粮食菜金及调养费，现母子均十分健康安适。其余留在这里的十个蒋军家属，她们的丈夫都在军官教导团学习，可以不时前往会见。她们的生活均受优待，极表感谢。
