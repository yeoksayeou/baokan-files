　　【From our correspondent in Changzhi, 5th】The people in the Jiang Kai-shek occupied areas of Anyang, unable to bear the frenzied plunder and slaughter by Jiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, have been streaming into the Liberated Areas in recent days. The Seventh District alone has received over two thousand people. The Anyang Democratic Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have instructed all districts and villages to properly settle these refugees, and have sent special personnel to the countryside to comfort and provide relief. Villages have set up refugee reception centers, where village cadres and refugee representatives jointly discuss ways to provide for the refugees' livelihood. First, they encourage mutual aid among the refugees; those without relatives or friends are provided loans by the village government, which are repaid without interest after the autumn harvest. Those who are unable to repay due to difficult circumstances are provided with grain relief by the government. Farmers' associations in various villages have automatically donated money or extracted a portion of the grain obtained from struggle to provide relief. The refugees in various villages have now been properly settled. The First District has also established four reception stations in Xizicheng, Xiapo, Xiaozhai, and other places to receive fleeing refugees, helping them to start fires for cooking; firewood and vegetables are provided free of charge. The masses in Xijiang Village in the Sixth District automatically send firewood and water to the refugees. When emergencies occur at night in Shuangquan Village, they also provide livestock to help the refugees relocate. The young and able-bodied refugees who have escaped from the stubborn areas have been organized to transport grain and harvest cotton under the cover of the militia. The families of militiamen and cadres who have fled are warmly welcomed by the emancipated masses in the old areas. Cadres and militiamen in Qu Gou, Yongding, Liusi, and other villages heard from the front lines that the old Liberated Area People's Government is taking very good care of their families, and they are very relieved. They unanimously expressed that they will fight to the end against Jiang Kai-shek's puppets, drive out the enemy, and repay the kindness of the comrades in the old Liberated Areas.
