Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: TASS, New York, 28th: US Democratic Congressman Deracy stated in an article in "Soviet Russia Today": "The American people demand that the US government stop aiding the Chinese war-makers." Deracy pointed out: This kind of aid is to enable the United States to gain economic control over its interests in China, and to create a "reliable" puppet government in the event of a war against the Soviet Union. Deracy stated: US troops and military supplies to China must be withdrawn from China. Deracy pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek represents the feudal landlords controlled by urban riffraff, speculators, secret police, and Nazi advisers, and is unconditionally supported by the US side. Deracy stated: "The establishment of a Chinese democratic coalition government will prevent Chiang Kai-shek from using the US reactionaries' hostility towards the Soviet Union." Deracy cited an unpublished State Department report on the CCP. The report stated: The decisive dividing line between the Kuomintang's policies and the Communist Party's policies lies in the former ensuring the interests of the big landlords, while the latter demands giving farmers enough land to ensure their economic security.

　　德拉西敦促美政府
    停止援蒋撤回美军
    【新华社延安二十九日电】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：美国民主党众议员德拉西于《今日之苏联》一文中称：“美国人民要求美政府停止援助中国战争制造者。”德拉西指出：此种援助是为了使美国在华利益得到经济之操纵权，并于一旦对苏战争爆发时，制造“可靠”之傀儡政府。德拉西称：美军及援华军用品必须自华撤退。德氏指出：蒋介石代表的是城市流泯、投机分子、秘密警察、纳粹顾问所把持之封建地主，并为美国方面无条件撑腰。德拉西称：“中国民主联合政府之成立，将防止蒋介石利用美国反动派对苏联之仇视。”德拉西引证国务院未经公布的有关中共之报告。该报告称：国民党政策及共产党政策之决定性的分水岭，在于前者以确保大地主利益，后者则要求给予农民之足够的土地来保证他们的经济安全。
