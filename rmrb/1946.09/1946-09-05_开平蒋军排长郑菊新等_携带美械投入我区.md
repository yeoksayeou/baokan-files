Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 1st. Zheng Juxin, deputy platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon, 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 17th Regiment, 43rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army stationed in Kaiping (located northeast of Tangshan, a station on the Beining Railway), and squad leader Wang Shijie, led four soldiers with one American-style light machine gun, one submachine gun, ten 7.9 rifles, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition, and defected to the Jidong liberated area on July 22nd in opposition to the civil war. When reporters met these young Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers wearing American-style uniforms, they all seemed extremely excited. Zheng Juxin, the 28-year-old deputy squad leader, said: "The Kuomintang army is afraid of soldiers deserting, and their control is very strict. Even just talking to the common people, you get beaten. But the more they do this, the less the brothers want to fight a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek; even though the American big noses are helping him with new weapons, if the soldiers using the new weapons are unwilling to fight for him, the new weapons are useless!"

　　开平蒋军排长郑菊新等
    携带美械投入我区
    【新华社遵化一日电】驻开平（位唐山东北，北宁路车站）蒋军四十三师十七团一营三连二排副排长郑菊新、班长王士杰，率领士兵四人携带美式轻机枪一挺、冲锋枪一支、七九步枪十支、子弹千余发，于七月廿二日反对内战投奔冀东解放区。记者会见这几个身着美式服装的蒋军青年官兵时，他们都显得异常兴奋。二十八岁的副班长郑菊新说：“国民党队伍怕士兵开小差，统治得非常严。就是随便和老百姓说句话，也得挨打。可是愈是这样，弟兄们愈不想替蒋介石打内战；尽管美国大鼻子帮助他新式武器，可是使新武器的士兵不愿意替他打，新武器也是枉然！”
