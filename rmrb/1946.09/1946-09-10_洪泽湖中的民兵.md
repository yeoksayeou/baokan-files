　　Militia in Hongze Lake
　　Lin Ding
　　Hongze Lake is located in the heart of the Suwan Border Region, between Siyang, Xuyi, Huai'an, and Sixian counties, covering an area of about 100 square kilometers with a population of approximately 40,000 to 50,000.

　　The people who make a living by shooting ducks and geese on the lake are collectively called "gun gangs," a major sideline for fishermen. The "gun gangs" were a form of self-defense organization formed by fishermen during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty to resist oppressive government. Some say that duck gun teams existed on Hongze Lake as early as the Tang Dynasty, but there is no confirmed evidence to study this.

　　The small boat used for duck shooting is called a "gun slipper," a small scull of about seven or eight feet long and two feet wide, which can only accommodate one or two people. If a pair of 150-160 pound duck guns are placed on it, it can only accommodate one person. A pair of duck guns are placed at the head of the slipper, with the shooter's lower body in the water and upper body lying prone at the stern. The guns have no sights, and everything depends on the shooter's skill. If the "net gang's" skill lies in casting nets, then the skill of shooting ducks lies in using the slipper. Because the gun on the slipper can be raised, lowered, and rotated left and right with the height and direction of the target to aim. The shooter's sights and scales all depend on his own hands. The best technicians in the gang are called "fire heads" or "line hands." Wang Daming and Liu Shulin, etc., who are now New Fourth Army cadres on the lake, were famous line hands in the past.

　　Duck guns come in two sizes, large ones weighing 80 pounds each and small ones weighing 50 pounds. The ammunition used is iron bullets (large ones like dates, small ones like beans) and saltpeter. The effective range is about four zhang (approximately 13 meters), and the power is very great. If used to hit Japanese gasoline boats, the entry point of the bullet is very small, but the exit point is a bowl-sized hole, which gave the Japanese a big headache, and they never figured out what kind of "cannon" it was.

　　Because they spend all year round in the lake, constant duck hunting has made them particularly skilled and accurate in shooting. Their targets are mallards (called wild ducks on the lake), geese, swans, etc. The dense grass in Chenzi Lake's duck ponds is the best area for shooting ducks. Half of the duck guns are concentrated here. The duck hunting season starts in August. A proverb circulates on the lake: "When the Yanmen Pass opens on the fifteenth of August, geese come with frost on their heads." The freezing winter is their golden age of production. On snowy nights, they go out in groups, wearing cowhide clothes up to their chests and white cloths on their heads, quietly rowing their gun slippers (if there is ice, they push them forward on the ice). When they get close to the target, they all get into the water. Slowly pushing the small slipper forward, when they are close to the target, the experienced "fire head" among them shouts "Add fire!" (take the cattail stick with gunpowder), "Aim well!" (i.e., aim), "Fire!" The word "fire" is the command. The duck guns fire in unison, and ducks and geese fall at the sound. Then they all turn the slipper and point the bow backwards (for fear that the gunpowder is not completely discharged and hurts people). Originally, the ducks and geese would take off when they heard the command, but they went through "nine kicks and eighteen flaps" (i.e., kicked nine times on the water and flapped eighteen times) before flying, so they were easily hit. The hunted ducks and geese were distributed equally, and those who didn't fire guns contributed some gunpowder. They were very loyal, so they were also called "righteous gangs."

　　On November 7th, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), a grand review of duck guns from the entire lake was held at Tiantai Estuary in Chenzi Lake. The duck guns stretched for three li of water, and various exercises were performed. The rumbling of gunfire filled the lake. From then on, the scattered gun gangs began to organize and formed the Lake Self-Defense Force.

　　In the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), there were six or seven hundred duck guns in the entire lake. In the thirty-third year (1944), there were more than seven thousand duck guns in the entire lake. Now, the self-defense army on the lake has been organized into a backbone team, also called the Duck Gun Company or Big Gun Team. In peacetime, they make a living by shooting ducks and geese and protect lake products such as water chestnuts, corms, and lotus. In wartime, they stand guard, patrol, and serve as combat guards on the lake, becoming the main self-defense force on the lake. Last summer, before the enemy in Xuyi surrendered, two duck gun companies, in cooperation with four companies of the New Fourth Army, blockaded the Huai River for three months. They dealt a very heavy blow to the enemy at Yuhoutan.

　　Now, the entire lake has × brigades and ×× companies, under the leadership of the militia detachment headquarters. The fishermen, who were most oppressed and exploited by landlords on land in the past, have been liberated under the protection of the democratic government and have established their own armed forces.

　　Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Hongze Lake has been calm, with merchant ships coming and going like shuttles every day. The democratic government has promulgated policies to protect fishermen and commerce, and it has become a prosperous floating market.

　　Chiang Kai-shek's guns of civil war finally broke the calm of the lake. To defend their homes, the guerrillas on the lake are active again. They are stationed in every headland, river mouth, and grass. Even in the dead of night, the shout of "Stop the boat!" can be heard. That is to check boats from unknown sources.

　　"Mobilize to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!" This call receives an active response here: "To protect our vested interests, we will fight the reactionaries to the end! Chiang Kai-shek has received rocket launchers from his American godfather, but we have indigenous rocket launchers here; we will make sure you come alive and leave dead!"

　　洪泽湖中的民兵
    林丁
    洪泽湖位于苏皖边区腹心的泗阳、盱眙、淮县、泗县之间，面积约一百方公里，人口约四五万。
    湖上以打鸭雁为生的人统称“枪帮”，是渔民中的一种主要副业。“枪帮”是清朝同治年间的渔民为反抗苛政而自卫的一种组织。一说，远在唐朝，洪泽湖上就有了鸭枪队；但已没有确证来考据了。
    打鸭枪所用的小船叫“枪溜子”，是一种七八尺长二尺多宽的小划子，船上只能蹲一两个人。如果再放上一对一百五六十斤重的鸭枪，就只能蹲一个人了。一对鸭枪放在溜子头，打枪的人下身在水中，上身伏在溜子尾部。枪上没有瞄准，全在枪手的技巧。如果说“网帮”的技巧在撒网，那么打鸭枪的技巧在使用溜子上。因为抢在溜子上面可以随着目标的高低左右而将溜子抬、压、转磨，使对准目标。他的标尺准星，全凭自己的两手标准。技术最好的帮中称为“火头”或“线手”。现在湖上新四军干部中的王大明、刘树林等都是过去有名的线手。
    鸭枪有大小两种，大的每枝重八十斤，小的重五十斤。它所用的弹药是铁弹（大的如枣，小的如豆）和硝石。有效射程在四丈左右，威力很大。如果去打鬼子的汽油划子，弹入口处很小，出口处就是碗大的洞，使日本鬼子非常头痛，始终没有研究出是什么“炮”。
    由于他们终年出没于湖中，常年打鸭生活的锻炼，使他们打枪特别熟练而准确。他们生产的对象是凫（湖上称野鸭）、大雁子、鹅等。成子湖的草丛中，鸭塘密集，成为打鸭的最好地带。有二分之一的鸭枪集中于此，打鸭期从八月开始，湖上流行着“八月十五雁门开，大雁头上带霜来”的谚语。严寒的冬天，是他们生产的黄金时代。雪夜中，他们成群结队，穿上高达胸部的牛皮衣，头上戴着白布，划着枪溜子悄悄出动（如结冰就在冰上推着前进）。快近目标时，都下水了。慢慢推着小溜子前进，距离目标近时，他们中间有经验的“火头”就喊“加火”（拿弹火的蒲棒），“对好”！（即瞄准）、“打”！喊出“打”字才是动令，鸭枪齐发，鸭雁随声而落，于是一齐将溜子磨转船头向后（恐火药没有射完而伤了人）。原来鸭雁在听到预令时即起飞，但在飞前经过“九蹬十八飞”（即在水面上蹬九下拍十八次），所以很容易打中。猎获的鸭雁，平均分配，没发枪的人出些火药。他们很讲义气，所以又叫“义气帮”。
    民国三十年十一月七日，在成子湖天台口举行了全湖鸭枪大检阅，鸭枪浩浩荡荡摆了三里水程的行列，并做了各种演习，隆隆的枪声沸腾于湖上。从那时起，散漫的枪帮开始组织起来，成立了湖上自卫队。
    民国三十年，全湖有六七百枝鸭枪。三十三年，全湖即有七千多支鸭枪。现在湖上的自卫军，已经编成基干队，又叫鸭枪中队或大枪队。在平时，他们靠打鸭雁为生，并且保护湖里的菱、茨、荷等湖产。战时都站岗放哨，担任湖上的战斗警戒，成为湖上的主要自卫力量。去年夏天，盱眙的敌人投降前，两个鸭枪中队配合新四军四个连，封锁淮河三个月。在玉猴滩给了敌人以非常大的打击。
    现在，全湖有×个大队，××个中队，归民兵支队部领导。过去最受陆上地主欺凌剥削的渔民，在民主政府保护下，已经翻了身，建立了自己的武装。
    抗战胜利以来，洪泽湖风平浪静，每日的商船穿梭似的来往，民主政府颁布了保护渔民和商业的政策，这里俨然是一个繁荣的水上市场了。
    蒋介石发动内战的枪声，终于划破了湖面的平静。为了保卫家乡，湖上的游击队又纷纷活动起来。他们在每个咀头、河口、草丛中放哨。那怕是深夜，也会有“停船”的吼声发出。那是在盘查来路不明的船只。
    “动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻！”在这儿得到行动的响应：“为了保卫既得的利益，我们要同反动派拚到底！蒋介石从他美国干爹手里领来了火箭炮，但是咱们这里有土火箭炮；管叫你们活的来，死的去！”
