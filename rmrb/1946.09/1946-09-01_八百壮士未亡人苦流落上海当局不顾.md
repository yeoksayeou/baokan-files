Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The wife and children of Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Eight Hundred Heroes who bravely defended the Sihang Warehouse in Shanghai at the start of the War of Resistance, along with seven or eight hundred of the heroes, are now destitute on the streets of Shanghai, abandoned by the Kuomintang authorities. According to a report in the Shanghai World Morning Post on July 25th: "Conscientious Chinese people, please listen to the tearful plea of Madame Ling Weicheng, wife of the martyred Commander Xie Jinyuan, who gave his life for the country: 'Commander Xie was loyal to the nation, and I sell my labor to support our four children, hoping for some solace in victory. In the thirtieth year of the Republic [1941], I traveled thousands of miles to Chongqing to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who comforted me and advised me to raise the children well, saying, "There will definitely be a solution after the victory." But now, a year after the victory, we orphans and widows are still living a precarious life, and the children cannot attend school. Those seven or eight hundred heroes are wandering the streets; the country has failed us! Now we have nothing left but being orphans and widows...'" As she spoke, Madame Xie sobbed uncontrollably, bringing her two youngest sons over to meet the reporter. They were two thin, impoverished children, the oldest seventeen. Her daughter, Xuefen, is in junior high school this year and followed her to Shanghai, but has been out of school for half a year. Tang Di, a company commander of the Eight Hundred Heroes, standing tall in his military bearing, also recounted how they had not received resettlement or employment, and are now wandering the streets, hoping for government relief.

　　八百壮士未亡人苦流落上海当局不顾
    【新华社沪讯】抗战开始坚守上海四口仓库的八百壮士的团长谢晋元的妻子儿女和七八百名壮士，现在流落在上海街头，国民党当局弃之不顾。据七月二十五日上海世界晨报消息说：“有良心的中国人，请来听听捐躯报国的谢晋元团长夫人凌维城女士的哭诉吧：“谢团长他为国家尽了忠，我卖劳力养活了四个孩子，指望着胜利有个安慰。三十年的时候，我千山万水赶到重庆见蒋委员长，蒋委员长劝慰我好好抚养孩子说：“胜利了一定有办法。”可是如今胜利一年了，我们孤儿寡妇还是朝不保夕的过苦日子，小孩子们上不了学。那七八十八百壮士们流落街头，国家对不起我们！如今我们什么也没有，就是孤儿寡妇……”言时谢夫人泣不成声，把她的两个最小的男孩子牵过来，让他们和记者见面，那是两个黄瘦贫弱的孩子，最大的十七岁，女儿雪芬今年上初级中学，跟着她奔跑来上海，又失学了半年。八百壮士之一的唐棣连长，挺着他高大的军人身躯，也在诉说着他们是怎样没有得到还乡没有得到就业，而流落在街头，盼望政府的救济。
