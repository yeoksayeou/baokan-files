Everything for the Victory of Self-Defense
	Handan City Actively Donates Money to Support the Army
	Organizations and Troops in Central Hebei Practice Economy to Improve the Life of the Front Lines
[Report from this newspaper in Handan, 3rd] With the frequent victories from the front lines, all sectors of Handan City are elated and encouraged. Under the call of Vice Chairman Rong, various organizations and schools have voluntarily tightened their belts, donating money and supplies to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. All teachers and students of the Border Region Postal School have spontaneously launched a donation campaign to support the army. In addition to individual voluntary donations, they also reduced the school's living standards for one month, using the saved materials to donate to the generals and soldiers on the front lines. Many people enthusiastically wrote letters of condolences and took out comfort items. In three hours, they donated more than 20,000 yuan. The International Peace Hospital, reorganized from the original Health Bureau, held a current affairs symposium a few days ago. A warm donation campaign was launched at the meeting. Director Zhu took the lead in setting an example, donating all of her monthly technical allowance (500 yuan), and other colleagues also signed up, raising 6,575 yuan in Hebei currency in more than 20 minutes. Six hospitalized patients also donated 1,200 yuan in foreign currency. Model transporter Comrade Bai Hebao also happily took out a piece of "sheep belly" white towel, which he won as a prize this spring, from his baggage as a gift. In the Second Elementary School of Handan City, after Vice Principal Cai donated 100 jin of millet, clothes, shoes and hats, the teachers also actively donated. Publicly funded students are willing to cook their rice thinner and donate 5 jin of millet each. Correspondent Wang Kefa said: "Now that I work in the Eighth Route Army, I have truly turned over. I am willing to donate 1,000 yuan." Under his influence, other administrative staff also enthusiastically took out their only savings to support the army. The Military Region Political Department's Literary and Art Troupe went to the front lines to support the army on the 28th of last month in response to the call of the Central Bureau. Before leaving, they had a heated discussion on the call of the Central Bureau and the editorial of the Yan'an Liberation Daily, and a heated competition was launched throughout the troupe.
	[Report from Wu'an] The Bianfu Yumin Printing Factory launched a production saving competition and a donation campaign to support the self-defense war. At a staff meeting, it donated 50,800 yuan in foreign currency, 2 zhang of white cloth, 1 towel, 4 pairs of foreign socks, and 1 thermos. (Yao Tang)
	[Report from Hejian, 4th] All sectors of the Central Hebei Liberated Area are contributing all their strength to serve the self-defense front. The call of the General Branch of the CPC Central Hebei District Committee on launching the "One Liang of Rice Movement" to improve the food of the front-line soldiers has been responded to by all organizations and schools. Staff of the Military Region Direct Team, the Border Region Bank, the Central Hebei Branch, the Hejian City Public Security Bureau and other organizations have first donated 5,500 jin of millet, and vegetable money and private savings amounted to 130,000 yuan. In order to ensure that the soldiers are always at full strength, Liu Xinchi, a judge of the Central Hebei Local Court, Su, the director of the Hejian City Public Security Bureau, and staff members Li Yonggui, Shi Renyi, Zhang Ganji of the Telecommunications Bureau, and more than ten other cadres have successively signed up to join the army. Wang Ying, a middle school student who had just escaped from Tianjin, also requested the democratic government to join the Eighth Route Army. The cultural and news circles of Central Hebei also put forward the slogan of "General Mobilization of Pens." The Central Hebei Guide Newspaper has cancelled the Sunday rest system and transferred some editors to participate in the reporter group organized by the Xinhua Branch to go to the front for interviews. The Military Region Political Department's Fire Front Theater Troupe is working day and night to rush to stage new dramas such as "Go to the Front Again," "Military-Civilian Cooperation for Self-Defense," and "Revenge and Accusation," and plans to tour with the army.
