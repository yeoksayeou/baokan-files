　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan on the 11th] Upon learning that General Zhao Xitian, commander of the Kuomintang army's Third Division who had laid down his arms, had arrived at the military region, Military Region Commander General Liu Bocheng immediately paid him a visit. General Liu inquired in detail about General Zhao's injuries and comforted him, saying, "Mr. Zhao has had a tiring life in the military, and now he is wounded. He should rest and recuperate without any worries. If there are any difficulties in life, we will do our best to help." General Zhao expressed his heartfelt admiration for Commander Liu's sincere concern and care. The host and guests had a very cordial conversation. Commander Liu analyzed the characteristics of this civil war. On the one hand, Chiang Kai-shek is betraying the country to maintain his dictatorial rule, serving the interests of a few people, and reducing China to a colony or an affiliated country. On the other hand, we are upholding national independence, democracy, and peace through eight years of resistance against Japan, fighting for the interests of the people of the whole country. This determines the dividing line of victory or defeat in this war. General Zhao nodded frequently in agreement, saying that the eight years of resistance against Japan drove away the Japanese invaders. Today, being forced to fight a civil war and attack the liberated areas is truly unfortunate. However, being able to come to the liberated area to receive teachings and suddenly awaken is a piece of good luck amidst misfortune. When Commander Liu was leaving, he repeatedly instructed our military personnel to treat General Zhao well and allow him to rest in peace. Currently, General Zhao's life is quite regular. He has three abundant meals a day, and there are doctors specially dedicated to providing patient care and treatment. His spirits are very good. Zhao is from Lianshui in northern Jiangsu. He is a graduate of the second class of the Whampoa Military Academy. He has served as deputy captain of the Whampoa Military Academy and as battalion commander, regimental commander, brigade commander, division commander, and army commander in the Kuomintang army. During the reorganization this summer, the Third Division was formed by combining the Eighty-ninth Army (Gu Xijiu's unit) and the Tenth Army (reorganized from Fang Xianjue's remnants). Zhao continued to serve as the division commander. This time, he was ordered to attack the liberated area and laid down his arms in Lizhai (belonging to Dongming). At that time, his remaining small number of troops were still resisting stubbornly. After General Zhao personally sent a letter to persuade them, they quickly laid down their arms, shook hands, and made peace with our army.

　　刘伯承司令
    往访赵锡田将军
    垂询伤势颇详宾主极欢洽
    【本报邯郸十一日电】军区司令员刘伯承将军闻悉放下武器之蒋军第三师师长赵锡田将军抵达军区，当即往访，刘将军对赵师长的伤势垂询颇详、并安慰说：“赵先生戎马生活疲惫，又加上挂了彩，要安心好好休养，不应有任何忧虑，生活上有何困难，我们当尽力而为。”赵师长对刘司令员之殷切慰问与关怀，表示衷心感佩，宾主谈话之间，极为欢洽。刘司令员分析这次内战特点，一方面是蒋介石卖国以维持独裁统治，为少数人的利益，把中国降为殖民地或附属国的地位；一方面却是八年抗战坚持民族独立民主和平，为全国人民的利益而奋斗，决定了此次战争胜负的分界线。赵师长频频颔首称是，并称八年抗战打走了日寇，今日被迫打内战进攻解放区，真是不幸，可是能来到解放区亲领教诲，顿开茅塞，也算不幸中之幸事。刘司令员临别时，再三叮嘱我军工作人员，好好招待赵师长，安心静养。现赵师长生活颇为规律，每日进三顿丰盛饭餐，并有医生专门耐心照顾治疗，精神甚佳。按赵为苏北涟水人，为黄浦第二期生，历任黄埔军校副队长及国民党军营长团长旅长师长军长等职，今夏整编时由第八十九军（顾锡九部）及第十军（由方先觉残部改编者）等部合编为第三师，赵仍任师长，此次奉命进攻解放区在李砦（东明属）放下武器，当时其残余之少数部队，仍负隅顽抗，经赵师长亲函劝谕后，亦迅速放下武器，与我军握手言欢。
