　　[Urgent Telegram from Yangcheng, Shanxi, September 24th] Our army's self-defense counterattack on the outskirts of Fushan has resulted in a great victory, with the complete annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage First Brigade (formerly the First Division). On September 23rd, Hu Zongnan deployed two regiments of his elite First Brigade, recently equipped in Luoyang and deployed to the Jin-nan internal war front, to launch an eastward attack along the Lin(fen)-Fu(shan) highway, attempting to reinforce the vanguard of the 167th Brigade (formerly a division) and destroy our Fushan Liberated Area in one fell swoop. However, as they advanced to the areas of Shangyang, Guanque, and Chenyan, 35 li from Linfen, they were immediately surrounded by our army and militia, and were annihilated successively on the mornings of September 23rd and 24th. During the thick of the battle, two companies of the said Chiang army staged an anti-civil war uprising on the battlefield. According to incomplete statistics, in this battle, excluding the dead and wounded, over 1,200 Chiang soldiers, including a regimental commander and below, were captured alive, and two mountain guns, seven rocket launchers, three anti-tank guns, six mortars, eighteen heavy machine guns, and other items were seized, which are still being inventoried. As of 11:00 on September 23rd, a portion of the Chiang army's 167th Brigade that had briefly invaded Fushan County was finally unable to withstand our defending forces' counterattack and retreated to the areas of Gangtou and Dongguo, more than ten li from the city. Our defending forces are now calmly deploying to deliver an even greater blow to the Chiang army should they attack again.

　　[Dispatch from the Tongpu Front, September 23rd] The Chiang army's 167th Brigade, which launched a large-scale offensive on the east side of Tongpu, occupied Nanpanqiao, south of Fushan, on the 19th. On the 21st, it again fiercely attacked Liangjiashan, but was repulsed by us that evening, retreating back to Nanpanqiao. On the 22nd, it again divided its forces into three routes, launching fierce attacks on the Eighth Route Army near Fushan City, occupying Xiaozhang Village, twenty li from Fushan City. The entire Fushan County has now entered a state of war. Under the call of the Farmers' Association, thousands of people from the three districts mobilized and razed to the ground all the enemy and puppet fortifications left behind in Dongzhang, Liangjiahe, Nanwangcun, Weicun, and other places overnight. The Armed Committee also dispatched capable cadres to the border areas to lead the masses in guerrilla warfare.

　　[Dispatch from Changzhi, September 23rd] On the morning of the 14th, our Qixian Independent Battalion and militia liberated Zihong Town, a strategic location in the Shangdang area. The remnants of the Yan puppet army, which we had routed, are now surrounded and being annihilated by us in Nantuanbai Village, ten li north of Zihong. Note: Zihong Town is the last major stronghold of the Yan puppet regime on the Baijin Line, and a famous strategic point. It is the gateway from the central Shanxi plain into the Shangdang Liberated Area, located more than thirty li southeast of Qixian County, on the Tongpu Road.

　　太行我克子洪镇白晋全线廊清
    【本报阳城廿四日晚急电】浮山外围我军自卫反击大捷，蒋介石嫡系第一旅（原第一师）全部就歼。二十三日，胡宗南以其刚由洛阳装备完毕投入晋南内战前线之精锐第一旅两个团，沿临（汾）浮（山）公路东犯，企图增援一六七旅（原师改称）先头部队，一举毁灭我浮山解放区。然当其刚伸至离临汾三十五里之上阳、官雀、陈堰一带时，当即被我军及民兵团团包围，于二十三、二十四日晨，先后予以歼灭。在战斗方酣时，并有该部蒋军两个连在战场上举行反内战起义。据不完全统计，在此次战斗中，除毙伤外，生俘蒋军团长以下一千二百余人，缴获山炮两门，火箭炮七门，反坦克炮三门，迫击炮六门，重机枪十八挺，其他正清查中。至此二十三日十一时曾一度侵入我浮山县城之蒋军一六七旅一部，在我守军反击下，终不支溃退至离城十余里之岗头、东郭一带，我守军现正从容布置，以予再犯蒋军以更大打击。
    【本报同蒲前线二十三日电】向同蒲东侧大举进犯之蒋军一六七旅，十九日侵占我浮山之南判桥后，二十一日复猛犯梁家山，当晚被我击溃，退回南判桥。二十二日又分兵三路，向浮山城附近八路军猛攻，占领距浮山城二十里的小张村。现在浮山全县已进入战争状态，在农会号召下，三区数千群众出动，一夜即将东张、梁家河、南王村、卫村等敌伪遗留下来的工事，全部平毁。武委会并派得力干部至边沿区，领导群众游击战争。
    【本报长治二十三日电】十四日上午，我祁县独立营及民兵，解放上党地区战略要地子洪镇。为我击溃之阎伪军，现被我围困于子洪以北十里之南团柏村聚歼。按：子洪镇为白晋线上阎伪最后一个强大据点，为著名战略要点，是晋中平原进入上党解放区之门户，位于祁县城东南三十余里同蒲路侧。
