Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai dispatch: According to statistics from the police department's occupational census here, the number of unemployed people in the city has reached over 250,000, including those in agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, transportation, as well as civil servants and freelancers, accounting for 6% of the total population. The number of people without any occupation (those with no job at all) has reached a staggering 1,350,000, accounting for 34% of the total population. Those employed only account for 21% of the population. In addition, there are nearly 6,000 prisoners, and more than 57,000 people who live by improper means. The total population of Shanghai is over 3,960,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Chongqing dispatch: Automobile drivers and mechanics on the Sichuan-Hunan Highway went on strike collectively on the 25th of last month. All 280-plus vehicles on the line have ceased operation, and the situation remained unresolved as of the 30th. The reason for the strike was to demand that the road bureau increase wages by 60% and allow the use of old materials stored in the bureau's warehouse for damaged parts and material replacements without any cost. At the same time, they demanded a specific definition of the so-called reward method after a car has travelled 5,000 kilometers as free repairs, but the road bureau has not responded to this.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to a Shanghai special dispatch from Chengdu's Xinmin Evening News on the 1st, over a thousand Shanghai Nanhua industry businesses, with more than 10,000 employees, suddenly launched a joint strike, demanding improved treatment. On the morning of the 1st, the employees of the industry also sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.
