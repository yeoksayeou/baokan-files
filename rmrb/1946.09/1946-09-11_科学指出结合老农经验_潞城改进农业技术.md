　　Science Guides, Combines with Experienced Farmers' Knowledge
　　Lucheng Improves Agricultural Technology
　　[This dispatch from Changzhi] During this year's great production movement, agricultural technology guidance has deeply penetrated the majority of old liberated areas in Lucheng County. In 82 out of the county's 168 administrative villages, sound village technology committees or technology guidance groups have been established. In other villages (mostly new areas), technical research activities such as inviting teachers and mutual observation have also taken place during the seedling management campaign. The county is also divided into 18 technical guidance zones, each responsible by 18 individuals (mostly construction assistants from the districts) who received short-term training at the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau this spring. The 359 individuals (labor heroes, village production cadres, etc.) trained by the county this spring have become the backbone of technical leadership in various villages today. The county's Construction Section, Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau's resident promoter in the county have become the organizers and leaders of the county's technical guidance work. The achievements of this work in the past six months are extremely significant: (1) Under the promotion of the technology committees, Lucheng farmers, who previously had no cotton planting experience, planted 35,700 mu of cotton this year, exceeding the plan by 19 percent. All cotton fields were hoed three times or more, and women and children in most villages learned the techniques of side-shoot removal and topping. Regarding oil blight (cotton aphids), villages have learned to use sprayers and pyrethrum emulsion, and have also independently researched and disseminated many insecticidal methods, such as using starfruit leaf root water, wheat bran water, and old dust from house beams. In particular, farmers discovered the secret of ants and oil blight during their research. After comrades from the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau scientifically explained the symbiotic relationship between ants and aphids, combining their own discoveries with scientific knowledge, they launched a campaign to eradicate ant nests, saving the majority of cotton fields. (2) This year, "169 Wheat" suffered from severe jaundice. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the Construction Section sent special personnel to various villages to organize and guide the work of preserving pure, high-quality seeds, such as removing mixed ears and diseased ears, selecting ears in the field, threshing and harvesting separately, separating grains, and conducting grading inspections. This enabled the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau to collect and preserve 110,000 jin of good seeds in the county this year. Other villages have widely carried out seed selection and rewarded seed selection models. (3) Other technical improvements include the creation of a lightweight human-pulled plow in Beicun that can plow five mu of land per day by two people, solving the problem of animal power shortage; the general improvement of seedling management technology; such as villages organizing skilled farmers to lead the hoeing, setting standards for everyone to learn, mutual inspection, and elders teaching women and children. During the summer manure accumulation campaign, villages also promoted the composting of wheat straw manure and the planting of bean green manure. Technical learning has formed a craze in Lucheng's rural areas. Farmers no longer stick to old ways but strive for improvement daily. Old farmers are respected in the villages and enthusiastically pass on their techniques to young people without being conservative. The only shortcoming is that the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has too few technical scientific personnel, and the work of summarizing farmers' experiences has not yet officially begun.

　　科学指出结合老农经验
    潞城改进农业技术
    【本报长治讯】潞城在今年大生产运动中，农业上的技术指导已深入大部老解放区农村，全县一百六十八个行政村中已有八十二村建立了健全的村技术委员会，或技术指导小组等组织。其他村庄（大部为新区）在锄苗运动中亦有请老师，互相观摩等技术研究活动。全县并划分为十八个技术指导区，由今春曾在长治农林局受短期训练的十八人（多为区的建设助理员）分别负责。今春该县训练的三百五十九人（劳动英雄、村的生产干部等）则成为今日各村技术领导之骨干，县建设科、农业试验场与长治农林局驻该县推广员则成为全县技术指导工作的组织者与领导者，半年来这一工作的成绩亦极显著：（一）在技术委员会推动下，向无植棉技术的潞城农民，今年植棉达三万五千七百亩，超过计划百分之十九，棉田全部锄了三遍以上，大部村庄的妇女儿童都学会了打杈去顶的技术。在油旱（棉蚜）上，各村均学会了使用喷雾器与除虫菊乳剂，还自行研究与传播了很多种杀虫办法：如采用杨桃叶根水，麦糠水，房梁陈灰等。特别是农民在研究中发现了蚂蚁与油旱的秘密，经农林局同志按科学讲解了蚂蚁蚜虫的共生关系，他们自己的发现与科学知识结合后，开展了铲除蚂蚁窝运动，挽救了大部棉田。（二）今年“一六九小麦”黄疸病严重，农林局，建设科曾特派员赴各村组织并指导保留纯良种籽工作，如进行拔掉杂穗，病穗，田间穗选，分场收打，分选粒与分级检定等，使农林局今年在该县得以收得十一万斤好种籽保藏下来，其他各村都普遍进行了选种并奖励选种模范。（三）其他技术改进如北村创造了一种轻便人拉犁两人一天能犁地五亩，解决了畜力困难；锄苗技术普遍提高，今年锄苗锄得精细；如村里组织好把式领导锄，锄出标准大家学，互相检查，老人教妇女儿童等。夏季积肥运动，各村又推广了沤麦秸粪与种豆绿肥。技术学习在潞城农村中已形成热潮，农民再不墨守成法而日求改进，老农在村中获得尊敬，热心地把技术传给年青人而再不保守。惟一缺点为农林局技术科学人员太少，总结农民经验工作还未正式开始。
