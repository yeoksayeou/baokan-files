　　【This newspaper, Handan, 20th】In order to achieve greater victories in the patriotic self-defense war, various regions continue to launch patriotic movements of frugality, donating money and labor. Comrade Hao Mingke, a binding worker at the Yongxing Printing Bureau's Second Factory, said after studying current affairs and relating it to his work: "In the past, my work was not done well, and I was very careless. In the future, I must completely change. In addition, I will donate 500 yuan in silver to the frontline soldiers to express my feelings." Zhang Yuling, foreman of the stone printing room, said: "In addition to ensuring good work and hard work to save money, I am willing to donate 1,000 yuan to comfort the front line. In order to increase production and cooperate with the front line to win battles, I will also volunteer two days of labor." Wang Shipei, the accounting section chief who recently came from the Fifth Division, said: "I will donate 1,000 yuan and lead the entire section to add voluntary labor, folding 4,000 pages a day for the binding room, and use the wages as long-term support for the front line until Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is crushed." In addition, some donated money, some contributed labor, and the entire factory contributed a total of 16,950 yuan, 308 hours of voluntary labor, and other materials such as towels, shoes, and cloth. All the teachers and students of the Leikou First Elementary School in Anyang mobilized and organized a propaganda team and a nursing team to prepare to participate in the war. In order to save coal, it has been decided to cut grass for cooking. A sick female student jumped out of bed happily when she heard the news of the donation, donating 100 yuan in silver. More than 30 elementary school students in the school alone donated 1,062 yuan. Comrade Chu Yuan, a traffic officer in the distribution section of this newspaper, carries thousands of copies of the newspaper to the Wu'an Post Office every day. In order to get the newspaper out as soon as possible, he doesn't even have time to eat breakfast every day. Recently, because he rushed to deliver the newspaper, his legs were so swollen that he couldn't move. Comrade Zhang Shenfu, a young orderly, bravely and automatically replaced Comrade Chu, saying: "In order for the frontline soldiers to see the newspaper as soon as possible, I will deliver the newspaper for Comrade Chu." They all know that "when the front line is fighting, the rear should support the front line with practical actions."
