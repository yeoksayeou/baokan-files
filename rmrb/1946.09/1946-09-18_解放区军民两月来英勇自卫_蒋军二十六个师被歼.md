　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: In the past two months, Chiang's army has been annihilated by the army and people of the liberated areas on various fronts by nearly 200,000 men from twenty-six divisions, accounting for approximately one-tenth of Chiang's forces attacking the liberated areas, averaging one division eliminated every two and a half days. By war zone, eight divisions (now renamed brigades) of Chiang's army were eliminated on the Central China front, six divisions (now renamed brigades) on the Longhai front, two divisions on the Tongpu front, and one division in eastern Suiyuan. In addition to eliminating the above seventeen entire divisions, thirty entire regiments, equivalent to nine divisions, were also eliminated. Other scattered eliminations of companies and platoons have not yet been calculated. On the central section of the Longhai Railway and in the liberated area of ​​Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Chiang's army has lost more than one-fifth of its forces during the invasion. After the disastrous defeat of Chiang's army on the western route, the focus of the war has shifted to the Dingtao area. On the Jiangsu-Anhui battlefield, since the seven disastrous defeats of Chiang's army on the southern front, Su Yu's New Fourth Army has recovered most of the occupied areas. The Chiang side attempted to reverse this declining trend and launched a large-scale invasion of the Lianghuai area on the 10th of this month. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the Siyang area, and thousands of invading Chiang soldiers have been annihilated. In eastern Suiyuan, Fu Zuoyi's troops launched a full-scale attack on Jining and were annihilated by one division and one regiment, accounting for approximately one-sixth of Fu's entire army.
　　The Eighth Route Army in central Shanxi has liberated more than ten strongholds, including Dui Jiuling, and the strategic key city of Xiaoyi has been completely isolated from Yan's army. The Eighth Route Army and militia in southern Shanxi have recovered the mountainous areas of Wenxi and Xiaxian counties, threatening the rear and flanks of Chiang's army. In the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area, with the help of the US military, the Chiang side invaded along multiple routes with several times the force. Although they occupied some towns, the Eighth Route Army and the vast militia continuously eliminated Chiang's army company by company. The army and people of the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area, tempered by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and nearly one year of self-defense war, are confident in maintaining their own strength and eliminating the enemy's strength until victory. We can confidently predict that Chiang's dream of eliminating the Eighth Route Army in Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning will definitely go bankrupt.

　　解放区军民两月来英勇自卫
    蒋军二十六个师被歼
    【新华社延安十五日电】两个月以来，蒋军在各个战线上已被解放区军民歼灭二十六个师近二十万人，约合蒋攻解放区兵力十分之一，平均计算每两天半消灭一个师。以战区计算，华中前线消灭蒋军八个师（现改称旅），陇海前线消灭六个师（现改称旅），同蒲前线消灭两个师，绥东消灭一个师。除了消灭以上十七个整个师以外，还消灭了三十个整个团等于九个师，其他零星的营和连的消灭还未计算在内。在陇海路中段及冀鲁豫解放区方面，蒋军在进犯中已损失了五分之一以上的兵力，西路蒋军惨败后，战事重心已至定陶一带。苏皖战场自南线蒋军七次惨败后，新四军粟裕部恢复大部被占地区，蒋方企图挽回此种颓势，本月十日大举进犯两淮地区，现泗阳一带正在激战中，进犯蒋军已被歼千人。绥东方面，傅作义部倾巢出犯集宁，被歼灭一个师一个团，约合傅军全部兵力六分之一。
    山西中部八路军已解放兑九岭等十余据点，阎军战略要点孝义城已完全孤立。晋南八路军及民兵光复闻喜、夏县山岳地区，威胁蒋军后方及侧翼。冀热辽地区蒋军在美军种种帮助之下，蒋方以数倍兵力分路进犯，虽侵占若干城镇，但八路军与广大民兵不断地一个营一个连地消灭蒋军。经过八年抗战与相近一年自卫战争下锻炼的冀热辽地区军民，是有把握保持自己力量消灭敌人力量，一直到胜利为止。我们可以肯定预言蒋方消灭冀热辽八路军的梦话一定破产。
