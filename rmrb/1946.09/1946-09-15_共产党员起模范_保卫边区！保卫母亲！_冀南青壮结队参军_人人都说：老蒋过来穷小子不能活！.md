[Report from our newspaper in Weixian, Southern Hebei, dated 11th] A wave of enthusiasm for joining the army is sweeping through 21 counties including Feixiang and Zaoqiang. In Nangong, 210,000 people from various districts joyfully sent off young men to the front lines. Before leaving, they said to their parents and wives who were seeing them off: "Don't worry, we are determined to fight to the end. We will never return until Old Chiang is driven back!" In Jize County, every village is sending recruits, and no village is sending only one person. They all say, "We just got our rice bowls, and Chiang Kai-shek is coming to take them away again. We'll fight him to the death! Anyway, if Old Chiang comes, poor kids can't survive!" Sixteen militiamen and young men from Chaizhuang, led by their captain, collectively enlisted. The Party branch secretary of Zhao Village led twelve young men in a collective enlistment. The militia instructor of Xiaozhai Village led seventeen young men to join the army. According to incomplete statistics, more than 600 young men in the county have already enlisted. In Nangong County, more than 450 young men have joined the army, and more than 200,000 people held enthusiastic send-offs. The director of the Nanliyue Farmers' Association in Quzhou took the lead in signing up for the army. He said to the villagers: "I am a Communist Party member, and I should set an example by joining the army. Although my mother is unwilling, if Chiang Kai-shek comes, no one's mother can be protected. For the sake of everyone's mothers, I have to go." The villagers said, "Your mother is our mother. Go for the sake of everyone!" In Liuzhuang, Feixiang, Liu Baolin's wife personally sent her husband to join the army. Stories of "wives sending their husbands to the battlefield, parents telling their sons to fight Old Chiang" are endless. More than 200 young men in the county have rushed to the battlefield. Zhang Jingcai from Dingzhuang in the Fifth District of Yuanchao County, is a demobilized soldier who continued to serve the people after returning home and was elected as a militia instructor. Hearing that Old Chiang was attacking the Liberated Areas, he automatically rejoined the army. 148 people enlisted from Yongnian, and 363 from Zaoqiang. Chengci is a new district, and the masses are undergoing emancipation. However, they know that Chiang Kai-shek will not let the people be emancipated if he comes, so their enthusiasm for joining the army is even higher. In Beinizhuang, four young men signed up voluntarily in one day. Young men in Guangping, Daming, and other counties are still continuing to sign up, requesting to be sent to the front lines.
