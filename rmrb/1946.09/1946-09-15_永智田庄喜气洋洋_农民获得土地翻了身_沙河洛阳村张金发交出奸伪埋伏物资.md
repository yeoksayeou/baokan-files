    Peasants Overturn Their Lives After Obtaining Land
    Zhang Jinfang of Luoyang Village, Shahe, Turns in Hidden Supplies of Traitors and Puppets
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 10th] Yongzhi Village has realized "land to the tiller." After an emancipation struggle, the village peasants recovered a total of 551 mu of lost land, and houses, timber, furniture, etc., worth 2.7 million yuan (foreign currency). Among the 223 households in the village, 124 poor peasant households (478 people, 504 mu of land) and two destitute families all obtained more than three mu of land per person. The method of land distribution was based on three mu of land as the standard. Those whose average land per person was less than three mu were supplemented to three mu. Those who had no land were given three mu. For those who had mortgaged land, if the mortgager was a landlord, the mortgage was unconditionally turned into a permanent sale. If they were from other classes, they were negotiated between the two parties to sell off part and redeem part. If they had cultivated public land or temple land in the past, they would hand it over and redistribute the land. To adjust good and bad land, families with better land were allocated slightly worse land, and families with bad land were given good land. Poor households who had fled famine and had not returned were left with their due share of land to be held until their return. Regarding the distribution of assets, members who participated in the struggle were the standard, and they were divided into eight classes according to their wealth. The most for the first batch of assets (about one million yuan) was 4,500 yuan per person, and the least was 240 yuan per person. This achieved the principle of more for the poor and less for the rich, and also encouraged the broad masses to participate in the struggle. Regarding the problems of poor dependents of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed, revolutionary personnel, in addition to calculating their population to divide land, were also given more assets. Regular army soldiers were given one and a half times more than ordinary people, local army soldiers were given one times more, and dependents of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers were given special care. If their lives were still not good after the distribution of fruits, they were given public land and temple land to cultivate. The orphaned and widowed were taken care of from the undistributed land. Regarding the issue of puppet dependents and puppet personnel, those who had repented and reformed, and were recognized by the masses as good people, were divided in the same way as ordinary people. If their reform was not thorough, their land was cultivated by the farmers' association on their behalf, and returned to them when they had reformed. For puppet dependents who had not returned, their land was also cultivated by the farmers' association on their behalf or leased to them, and returned to them after they had been won over to return home, or it was confirmed that they had died. However, the puppet soldier himself was not counted as part of the population. Regarding the issue of rewards, 3% was extracted from the assets for distribution, 4/10 for activists, 3.5/10 for militia, and 2.5/10 for children's corps and sisters' groups. After the distribution of fruits, the village was filled with joy. Some said, "After being poor all my life, I can now count on having a few mu of land." Some put on the socks they had been given and happily said, "This is like arriving in Tianjin." An old man who had lived in a temple for many years said, "Our old couple has been given six mu of land, we can live a few more years. Chairman Mao's kindness, we will never forget it even in death!"
    [Our Newspaper, 11th] Zhang Jinfang, a farmer member of Luoyang Village, Shahe, was honest and kind. Under the threat of Fan Bangqing, a traitor in the village, he was forced to hide some of his stolen goods for him. When he saw Fan being overthrown by the masses, he realized that traitors were everyone's enemy and that everyone should rise up and fight against them. At the same time, he deeply felt the shame of protecting his oppressors, so he voluntarily confessed to the masses that Fan had hidden seven dou of wheat and two fat pigs in his house. He also expressed that he had been fooled by the traitor and asked the masses for forgiveness. Under his influence and the village chief's encouragement, six households immediately confessed on the spot and handed over clothes, farm tools, livestock and other items hidden for the traitors and puppets, worth 38,000 yuan (Hao Aiguo).

    【本报十一日讯】沙河洛阳村农会员张金发，老实，忠厚，曾在该村汉奸范邦庆的威胁下，被迫替他埋伏了一部分赃物。当他看见范逆被群众斗倒后，觉悟到汉奸是大家的仇人，应该大家起来斗争。同时，深感包庇自己的压迫者的可耻，遂自动向群众坦白，说出范逆在自己家里隐避的七斗麦子和两口肥猪，并表示上了汉奸当要求群众原谅、在他的影响下和村长的奖励下，当场即有六户坦白交出替奸伪埋伏的衣服、农具、家畜等物，值洋三万八千元（郝爱国）
