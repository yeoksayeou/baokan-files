　　Tuncun Second District Reviews One Year of Mass Movement
    Half of the Peasants Not Yet Mobilized
    Fatalistic Ideology of Impending Change Still Seriously Exists
    [Reported from Yangcheng, this newspaper, on the 19th] On August 28th, the Tuncun Second District convened a meeting of six hundred poor peasants from fifty-two villages to summarize the mass movement in the district over the past year. It was discovered that since the mobilization of the masses began last year, nearly a year ago, half of the peasants in the district have still not been liberated. A few cadres believe that the fear of change and fatalistic ideas that were once thought to be a thing of the past still exist to a serious extent. During the three-day discussion, it was found that there are still many concerns among the backward masses. Summarizing them, there are nine major fears: (1) fear of retaliation by landlords, (2) fear of legal constraints, (3) fear of being struggled against by others after struggling against them, (4) fear of "not being able to hold onto good fortune after being liberated" (i.e., being destined to not live a good life), (5) fear of losing conscience, (6) fear of bad cadres causing trouble, (7) fear of large villages protecting the objects of struggle, leading to factional struggles, (8) fear of not being able to cultivate the recovered land and still having to pay burdens, (9) fear of disunity among cadres, causing oneself to be controlled in the middle. This discovery greatly surprised the cadres present, who resolved to patiently delve into the masses and boldly satisfy their demands in order to realize land to the tiller. They are now studying specific ways to implement this.

　　屯留二区检查一年群运
    半数农民尚未发动
    变天宿命思想仍严重存在
    【本报阳城十九日电】上月二十八日，屯留二区召集五十二个村的六百贫苦农民集会，总结该区过去群众运动。发现自去年发动群众以来，至今已将近一年，全区仍有半数农民尚未翻身。少数干部认为早已成为过去的怕变天与宿命论思想，也仍严重存在。在三天讨论中，发现落后群众中仍有许多顾虑。归纳起来，则为九大怕：（一）怕地主报复，（二）怕法令束缚，（三）怕斗争别人以后又被别人斗争，（四）怕“翻了身福不住”（即命中注定不能过好日子），（五）怕丧良心，（六）怕坏干部捣鬼，（七）怕大村包庇斗争对象，闹成宗派斗争，（八）怕收回地无力耕种，还要出负担，（九）怕干部不团结，自己在中间受制。这一发现，使到会干部大吃一惊，决心艰苦耐心的深入群众，放手满足群众要求，以实现耕者有其田，现在研究具体贯彻办法。
