　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 1st: The CCP spokesperson in Beijing and Shanghai recently issued a statement regarding the United States providing surplus war materials to the Chiang Kai-shek government, stating: General Petersen's visit to China by the US side is closely related to the US government's support of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war with materials and the Nanjing government's preparation to sell its airspace. It is found that the US military has a large amount of surplus military equipment, ammunition, trucks, Jeeps, and transportation and communication equipment in Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and Japan, and its actual value far exceeds the reported 350 million US dollars or 500 million US dollars. This time, Petersen was invited to China to secretly discuss with Song Ziwen how to sell the above-mentioned huge amount of materials to the Nanjing government at a low price for the purpose of carrying out a civil war. It is heard that the discounted price for the sale will be calculated at 25% of the original value in the discussion between Petersen and Song. The spokesperson continued: As early as July 30th, the Central News Agency issued a dispatch from Washington stating: The US Congress has approved a credit loan of 150 million yuan to China by the Foreign Liquidation Committee for China to purchase US surplus property. The dispatch also stated that the interest rate on the credit loan is 2 and 8/3 percent, and if needed, this loan can be increased to 200 million US dollars. Sure enough, on August 17th, US Assistant Secretary of War Petersen and Mr. McBee, a member of the US Foreign Liquidation Committee, and their entourage of 28 people flew to Shanghai to discuss with the Nanjing government the sale of surplus materials from the Pacific islands and mentioned the loan issue. On the same day, Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen flew from Guling to Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Joe Sheng, the wholesale host of the US Foreign Liquidation Committee, also rushed back from Ping, and a meeting was held at the Cathay Hotel on the 18th. In addition to Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen, Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau, and others attended the meeting on the Nanjing side, and discussed the two issues of surplus materials and loans at the same time. According to the Xinwen Bao on the 22nd, the amount of the loan reached 350 million to be used for the purchase of surplus materials.
    The spokesperson said: It must be pointed out that although the US surplus materials include medicines and other detailed items, amounting to thousands of types, the main part of this transfer to the Kuomintang government is weapons, military equipment, military radio equipment, military trucks, and other military equipment. According to another report, the loan amount is not 350 million yuan, but 500 million US dollars. According to experts, the price of the surplus materials is about a quarter of the original value. If the loan is indeed 350 million US dollars, then the original value of the materials should be 1.4 billion US dollars. If the loan is indeed 500 million US dollars, then the original value of the materials should be 2 billion US dollars; however, how to deliver the materials is the most important aspect of the current negotiations.
    The spokesperson pointed out: It is reported that the Nanjing government has decided to use China's airspace rights as collateral to facilitate the concretization of this negotiation and requested the US to transport the above-mentioned materials to Chinese ports for unloading. This news also contains extreme seriousness and should be deeply noted by peace-loving people around the world and our compatriots from all walks of life. It must be understood that if the Nanjing government continues to sell China's sovereign airspace after essentially selling its inland waterways under the guise of so-called opening up inland river navigation, then our country will not only become a US commodity market economically, but will also become a US colony administratively.
    The spokesperson also said: On the other hand, we must point out that after Japan's surrender, the US government supported the Nanjing government with 1 billion US dollars worth of materials, and the result was the evolution of the full-scale civil war recently launched by Chiang Kai-shek. Today, if the US government supports the Nanjing government with another 500 million US dollars worth of materials, then the fascists within the Nanjing government will receive the greatest encouragement, and it is unknown how far China's civil war will go. If this tragic civil war continues to escalate, the US government should bear the greatest responsibility.
    The spokesperson loudly called: All patriotic compatriots should rise up and resolutely oppose the treacherous negotiations being conducted between the Nanjing government and the US government representatives. We warn the US government to immediately stop these negotiations aimed at expanding the Chinese civil war, otherwise the US government should bear the responsibility for all the serious consequences caused by this event.

### 京沪方面中共发言人  呼吁爱国同胞  反对卖国谈判

　　京沪方面中共发言人
    呼吁爱国同胞
    反对卖国谈判
    【新华社南京一日电】京沪方面中共发言人，顷就美国以剩余战争物资让给蒋介石政府一事发表谈话称：美方彼特森将军来华实与美国政府以物资支持蒋介石内战与南京政府准备出卖领空，有密切关系。查美军在琉球琉璜岛及日本等地有剩余军械、弹药、卡车、吉普及交通通讯器材甚多，其实际价值远超出报纸所传三亿五千万美元或五万万美元以上。此次彼特森应邀来华，乃系与宋子文密商如何将上项巨量物资以廉价让售南京政府进行内战。闻让售折价，此次彼宋商谈拟以二五折计算。发言人继称：远在七月三十日，中央社即自华盛顿发表电讯谓：美国会已核准对外清算委员会一亿五千元之对华信用贷款，以作中国购买美剩余财产之用。该电并称信用贷款利率为百分之二又八分之三，且如需要时，此项贷款更可增至二亿美元。果然八月十七日美陆军部次长彼特森及美对外清算委员会委员麦克比偕随员等一行二十八人飞抵上海，与南京政府商谈让售太平洋各岛剩余物资并提及借款问题。同日行政院长宋子文由牯岭飞沪，当时美对外清算委员会批发主持人乔生亦由平赶回，遂于十八日在华懋饭店举行会议。南京方面除行政院长宋子文外，物资供应局长江杓等人均出席，同时商讨剩余物资及借款两项问题。据二十二日新闻报载：此次借款为数达三亿五千万以作购买剩余物资之用。
    发言人说：必须指出，美国剩余物资包含药品在内，详细项目虽达数千种，但此次让与国民党政府者，其主要部分为武器军火军用无线电装备军用载重汽车及其他军用器材。借款数目据另一报告并非三亿五千万元，而为五亿美元。又据专家估计，此次剩余物资作价约合原值四分之一，若借款实为三亿五千万美元，则物资原值当为十四亿美元，若借款果为五亿美元，则物资原值当为二十亿美元；但物资如何交付，为现在商谈中之最重要关节。
    发言人指出：据悉南京政府决定以我国领空权作为抵押，以促成此谈判之具体化，并要求美方代运上项物资到中国港口卸货，此一消息亦包含极端严重性，应为世界爱好和平人士及我全国各界同胞所深切注意之事件。要明白南京政府在所谓开放内河航行实质上即出卖内河后，若再继续出卖中国领空主权，则我国除经济上已沦为美国商品市场之外，行政上也将沦为美国殖民地。
    发言人又谓：另一方面，吾人必须指出，美政府在日本投降以后，曾以十亿美元之物资支持南京政府，而其结果即为最近蒋介石所发动之全面内战之演成，今日如美政府又以五亿美元之物资支持南京政府，则南京政府内法西斯派又获最大鼓励，而中国内战不知将达于胡底。此惨痛内战如再趋扩大，美国政府方面应负最大责任。
    发言人大声呼吁：凡属爱国同胞，应起而坚决反对此次南京政府与美国政府代表间进行之卖国谈商，吾人警告美国政府应立即停止此项扩大中国内战为目的之谈商，否则美国政府应担负此事件所引起之一切严重后果之责任。
