　　Women from All Circles in Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan
    Send Telegram to Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yingchao
    [Our newspaper's Handan dispatch] Women from all circles in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region recently sent a telegram to Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yingchao, putting forward a formal proposal. The original telegram is published as follows:
    To Madam Soong Ching-ling and Madam Deng Yingchao, via the Nanjing delegation of the Chinese Communist Party:
    When we, the 30 million compatriots in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, heard that you will be attending the International Women's Congress, we were all greatly inspired. A symposium of women's circles in the border region was specially held in Handan City, unanimously supporting you as our representatives. At a time when the reactionary clique of Chiang Kai-shek is intensifying its traitorous civil war, implementing a secret agent dictatorship, creating the Wen Yiduo-Li Gongpu massacre, and assassinating democratic figures, it is of particular significance. To this end, we unanimously appeal to the congress as follows: (1) The United States government should immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek with weapons and ammunition; (2) The United States government should immediately withdraw its naval, land, and air forces stationed in China; (3) Surplus materials in the Southwest Pacific should not be sold to Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war; (4) It is proposed that the United Nations establish a human rights guarantee agency to send people to China to investigate secret service organizations, atrocities, and secret concentration camps. The International Women's Congress should send people to participate in this investigation; (5) The liberated areas have supported the long-term resistance behind enemy lines and have made outstanding contributions and suffered the most severely. Please ask the United Nations to provide medical and material relief.
    Please strive for the above opinions at the conference, and please call on all of the United States and the International Women's Congress to rise up together to oppose and stop the erroneous policy of the United States government in creating civil war in China, and solemnly declare that we will spare no effort to support the patriotic self-defense war in the liberated areas and strive to crush Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war and establish a peaceful and democratic New China. We respectfully submit this statement and wish you success.

　　晋冀鲁豫各界妇女
    致电宋庆龄邓颖超
    【本报邯郸讯】晋冀鲁豫各界妇女，顷致电宋庆龄、邓颖超，提出正式提案，兹将原电发表如下：
    南京中共代表团转宋庆龄、邓颖超两女士：
    你们将出席国际妇女大会，我晋冀鲁豫边区三千万同胞闻讯无不振奋，特假邯郸市举行边区妇女界座谈会，一致拥护你们为我们的代表，当此蒋介石反动派加紧进行卖国内战，实行特务独裁统治，制造了闻李惨案，暗杀民主人士之际，尤有重大意义。为此我们一致向大会提出以下呼吁：（一）美国政府应立即停止以武器军火帮助蒋介石；（二）美国政府应立即撤退驻华海陆空军；（三）西南太平洋剩余物资不应卖给蒋介石打内战；（四）提议联合国组织人权保障机关，派人来华调查特务组织与暴行及秘密集中营，国际妇女大会应派人参予此种调查；（五）解放区在敌后支持长期抗战，功绩独多，受灾最重，请联合国给予医药与物资救济。
    以上意见请在大会力争，并请呼求全美国与国际妇女大会，共同奋起，反对与制止美国政府制造中国内战之错误政策，严正申明我们将不惜一切支援解放区的爱国自卫战争，为粉碎蒋介石的卖国内战，建立和平民主新中国而奋斗。谨此上言，并祝胜利。
