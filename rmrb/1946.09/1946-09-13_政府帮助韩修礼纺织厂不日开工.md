　　Government Helps Han Xiuli Textile Factory to Open Soon
    [This newspaper Changzhi, 11th dispatch] Mr. Han Xiuli of Wu'an, after donating materials worth 20 million yuan (border region currency) to the masses in Chengguan in the middle of last month, the masses, under the leadership of the People's Association, jointly discussed the disposal method with Mr. Han. Mr. Han proposed: "We must repay any debts we owe to anyone." The masses proposed a method of settling accounts: repay one for each one owed, without calculating any interest. In addition to repaying 30 percent of the debt to the masses, 70 percent (14 million yuan) was returned to Mr. Han, asking him to boldly invest in industry and commerce. The government also proposed: "In the future, not only will we guarantee the safety of Mr. Han's property, but we will also actively support his development in industry and commerce." Mr. Han was so moved that he repeatedly wrote letters to the government to express his gratitude, saying, "I am willing to run a factory well, prosper the market, and do things for the people, in order to repay the government and the masses for their kindness." Currently, Mr. Han is busy with establishing a textile factory. In addition to hiring economic committee members from the government, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce, and the United Cooperative to organize a preparatory committee to study the opening matters, he also sent people to recruit technical workers and purchase textile machines. Furthermore, fifteen silk and satin shops, including Fulihao, Hengfengde, Deyuancheng, and Yuxinhe, have invested 30 percent of their capital (more than 5 million yuan) in Mr. Han's textile factory, with the capital nearing 20 million yuan. It is reported that the factory will open in late September.

　　政府帮助韩修礼纺织厂不日开工
    【本报长治十一日电】武安韩修礼先生于上月中旬以价值二千万元（边币）的物资献于城关群众后，群众即在平民会的领导下，与韩先生共同商讨处置办法。韩先生提出：“欠任何人的账，咱都要还”。群众提出算账的办法是：欠一个还一个，不算分文利息。除以百分之三十偿还群众债务外，百分之七十（一千四百万元）归还韩先生，请其大胆向工商业投资。政府亦提出：“今后不但保证韩先生的财产安全，而且要积极扶植其在工商业上的发展。”韩先生感动的曾屡次致函政府致谢说：“我愿好好办工厂，繁荣市场为人民做事，以报答政府及群众对我的恩爱。”现韩先生正为兴办纺织厂忙碌着，除聘请政府、工商局、商联会、联合社等经济委员组织筹委会，研究开办事宜外，并差人四出招募技术工人，购置纺织机。且已有福利号、恒丰德、德元成、裕信和等十五家绸缎庄以百分之三十的资本（五百多万元）投资韩先生的纺织厂，资本已近二千万元。闻该厂于九月下旬即可开工。
