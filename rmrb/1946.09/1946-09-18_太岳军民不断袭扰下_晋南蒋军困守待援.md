Under Constant Harassment by Taiyue Soldiers and Civilians,
    Chiang's Troops in Southern Shanxi are Trapped and Await Reinforcements
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 14th dispatch] The warmongers Hu Zongnan and Yan Xishan, their ambitions undiminished, are attempting a comeback to connect the Datong-Puzhou Railway and expand the civil war in Shanxi. On the 29th of last month, Yan Xishan specially sent representatives Liang Huazhi and Bo Youcheng to Xi'an to discuss methods for expanding the civil war with Hu Zongnan's representatives. Liang and Bo returned to Taiyuan on the 5th. The result of their discussions was that Yan's troops would concede Linfen and concentrate heavy troops in the Jiexiu area, while Hu Zongnan would solely confront southern Shanxi. Although Hu felt his troop strength was insufficient, he actively mobilized troops to invest in the front lines of the civil war in southern Shanxi. Since the 25th of last month, Hu Zongnan has ordered five brigades (all reorganized from divisions), namely his 67th Brigade, 27th Brigade, 167th Brigade, 78th Brigade, and 30th Brigade, to launch a large-scale offensive on the eastern side of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, attempting to fully occupy our southern Shanxi liberated area, as a base for his continued northward advance to open the Datong-Puzhou Railway. They successively captured the county towns of Jiangxian, Yuanqu, and Yicheng, and actively expanded towards the Zhongtiao Mountains liberated areas of Yuan (qu), Jiang (xian), Xia (xian), and Wen (xi). At this point, Chiang's army, Hu's forces, were distributed on a line 70 to 140 li from the railway line and 210 li long from north to south, constantly harassed by our military and civilian guerrilla groups. The Hu's invading forces, who were "mopping up" our troops in the mountains of Wen (xi) and Xia (xian), suffered two major blows from our forces within a week, from August 28th to the 4th of this month. The 167th Brigade (originally reorganized from a military division) of the 1st Division, which Hu's forces had newly transferred, was forced to temporarily halt its advance after invading Yicheng on the 3rd, and is now urgently seizing civilian laborers to construct fortifications, awaiting reinforcements before attacking again.

    【本报阳城十四日电】好战分子胡宗南、阎锡山野心未死，企图卷土重来，贯通同蒲路，扩大山西内战，上月二十九日阎锡山特派代表梁化之、薄右丞飞赴西安与胡宗南代表商谈扩大内战办法，梁、薄已于五日飞返太原，双方商讨结果，为阎军让出临汾，集结重兵于介休一带，胡宗南独挡晋南。胡虽感兵力不足，但仍积极调集部队投入晋南内战前线。自上月二十五日起，胡宗南即令其六十七旅、二十七旅、一六七旅、七十八旅、三十旅（均为师改称）五个旅之兵力，向同蒲路东侧大举进犯，企图全面占领我晋南解放区，以为其继续北犯打通同蒲的依托，先后陷我绛县、垣曲、翼城三县城，并积极向垣（曲）绛（县）夏（县）闻（喜）中条山解放区扩张。至此，蒋军胡部分布于距铁路线七十至一百四十华里、南北长达二百一十华里之线上，遭我军民游击集团不断的袭扰。“清剿”闻（喜）夏（县）山地我军之胡部进犯军，八月二十八至本月四日一周内，即遭我两次重大打击，胡部增调来之第一师一六七旅（原军原师改称），三日侵占我翼城后，被迫暂时停止进犯，正强抓民夫加紧构筑工事，待援再犯。
