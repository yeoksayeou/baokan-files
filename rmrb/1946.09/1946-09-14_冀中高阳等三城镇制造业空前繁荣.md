Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 11th. Various businesses, commercial firms, and manufacturing plants in An'guo, Gaoyang, Xingguo, and other three towns in the Jizhong Liberated Area have dramatically increased from 400 under enemy and puppet rule to 1,400. There are now 45 medicinal herb firms in An'guo with 400 pharmaceutical workers, a scale five times larger than before liberation. Raw and processed medicinal materials from North China and beyond the Shanhaiguan Pass are now gathered and distributed here, showing a strong tendency to surpass the Tianjin medicinal herb market. In Xinji City, the center of Hebei's leather industry, there are now over 70 leather and leather goods businesses, with over 450 leather workers. During the hot summer months, the average monthly turnover has already reached over 44 million yuan. The Gaoyang textile market is also experiencing unprecedented prosperity. Currently, each market day sees sales of over 12,000 bolts of dyed cloth, over 3,400 jin of cotton thread, 2,000 to 4,000 jin of fine thread, and over 5,000 jin of seed cotton. The number of newly opened dyeing and weaving factories and commercial firms has increased fourfold compared to before liberation. The horsehair sieve industry in An'guo has even exceeded pre-war levels.
