    Attacks Yong'an Village
    Eliminating Two Platoons of the Yan-puppet Machine Gun and Artillery Company
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, 17th] The Taihang Qixian Independent Battalion, combined with the militia, has been carrying out self-defense counterattacks on the Gengqin Line for several days. On the night of the 11th, it also largely eliminated two platoons of the machine gun and artillery company belonging to the 1st Regiment of the Yan-puppet 9th Column stationed at the Yong'an Village stronghold north of Ziqi Pass. Only one squad escaped. A total of more than 30 Yan-puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, and 27 were captured. Two mortars, one machine gun, more than ten rifles, 75 shells, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and six warhorses were seized. The two internal war blockhouses occupied by them to oppress the surrounding people were immediately burned by us.
