Self-Defense Heroes

    Plan to Attack Xingjiaquan
    The artillery was set up 500 meters away from Xingjiaquan's fortress, but it was too dark, and even at such a close distance, the fortress was still blurry. The artillerymen felt it was difficult, but someone came up with a plan.
    Five people, carrying a bundle of firewood, quietly crept towards the fortress. Everyone watched intently as these five people moved forward. The five reached the fortress and quietly dug a single-person shelter first. After digging the shelter, four people retreated, leaving one person to guard the firewood.
    The artillerymen waited with the cannon ready. Suddenly, a pile of firewood under the fortress 500 meters away blazed up, illuminating half the sky, illuminating the fortress. The artillery quickly aimed and fired. The shells hit the fortress, sparks flew in all directions, and the fortress shook violently, with people inside screaming.
    "Surrender! Surrender!"
    Twenty-four guns were handed over, and twenty-four people walked out.

    Fen River
    Liu Jianbin guarded the Fen River for most of the night. The water of the Fen River "rushed" loudly, but no one crossed over from the other side. He was a little anxious, his eyes wide open, hoping someone would emerge from the Fen River so he could capture a few and take them back.
    Around daybreak, people were getting tired, but there was a "plop! plop!" sound from the other side of the river. Liu Jianbin saw countless dark figures crossing over from the other side, and quickly, the first person to charge over grabbed his arm. Liu Jianbin calmly shouted, "Comrades, charge!" The ten people ambushed behind him climbed out simultaneously, blocking and attacking these dozens of people. Liu Jianbin was very calm, first smashing the head of the person grabbing him with a grenade, and then quickly stabbing another person to his left front with a bayonet.
    The dozens of people panicked even more, turning back and jumping into the Fen River. Liu Jianbin and his comrades concentrated their fire.

    Yi Kaiyun Cleverly Captures Prisoners
    The enemy's two mortars and heavy and light machine guns fiercely bombarded Yi Kaiyun's position. Stones and sand on the Fen River beach were blasted one or two zhang high and fell back into the Fen River. This did not damage Yi Kaiyun's position; they still held the Fen River mouth, determined not to let anyone cross the Fen River to reinforce Zhaocheng.
    Some people would calculate from mechanical numbers. Over a thousand people against seventy or eighty people, a huge ratio. But even with over a thousand men rushing over several times, Yi Kaiyun and his comrades only used a few grenades to force them back, those who didn't have time to run dying on the river beach.
    A sliver of white light appeared on Dongshan Head. The cool morning breeze of August brought a bit of chill, but Yi Kaiyun and his comrades felt nothing.
    There was a commotion in the distance. A group of enemies fleeing from the city desperately jumped into the Fen River, throwing their American-style helmets, backpacks, guns, and other items into the Fen River. Some floated on the water, some sank to the bottom, and some were stopped on the riverbank. Yi Kaiyun and his comrades quickly prepared, as there were enemies in front and behind. Those crossing the river had already charged over and become a chaotic mass, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Yi Kaiyun was a little anxious, but there was nothing he could do. At this moment, another group of enemies carrying full weapons crossed over. Yi Kaiyun had an idea and greeted them: "Come! Come! This side is the Eighth Route Army, that side is our people, hurry, follow me, hurry..."
    The fifty or sixty people who had crossed the river followed Yi Kaiyun in a panic, some dropping their American helmets and taking off their American-style clothes along the way, putting on the prepared civilian clothes. Our Yi Kaiyun planned that it would be good if he could deceive more over.
    Passing the river beach, passing the farmland, Yi Kaiyun walked towards his machine gun position, and the people behind followed.
    As Yi Kaiyun approached the machine gun position, he quickened his pace, jumped over, and instructed the machine gunner: "Attention! The front is the enemy, fire!" The machine gun "da-da-da" started firing, and Yi Kaiyun shouted: "Surrender and be spared! Surrender and be spared!" More than sixty people obediently surrendered their guns.

    Two Model Political Instructors
    Political Instructor Li Xuetang of the 60544th Small Team, leading his team in a counterattack to the city of Qixian, was wounded in the waist but still bravely charged and occupied the city tower. Unfortunately, he was then wounded in the spine. His comrades wanted him to leave the front line, but he said: "Don't worry, comrades! I have a minor injury, keep fighting!" He continued to command the team in battle. During street fighting, he was wounded in the head but still refused to leave the front line. He shouted, "Comrades! We have won, if the enemy doesn't surrender, take their lives!" Under the urging of his comrades, he finally went to the aid station for treatment. Deputy Political Instructor Shi Shuting of the 8th Small Team, personally led the 5th Squad in pursuing the Chiang troops to the south within the city, crossing many rooftops and walls, breaking through the fire blockade line. As they approached the city tower that the Chiang troops were using for counterattacks, he charged up alone, seizing two light machine guns, one Czech rifle, and one heavy machine gun from the enemy.

    First to Ascend the City
    Comrade Yin Gongrong of the 546th Small Team was the hero who was the first to seize and ascend the city wall. At the mobilization meeting, he said: "This time in battle, I will resolutely complete the task! I will be in the lead, even if I sacrifice completely, as long as there is one person, we must get up!" At 12:15 p.m., with the sound of a mountain gun, they advanced by setting up ladders and throwing bombs. Soon, they raised the ladder, and Yin Gongrong was the first to ascend the city. In less than five minutes, his entire squad was on the city, and they immediately engaged in a battle for control of the city with the Chiang troops. The situation was very tense, he shouted: "There are no enemies left!" All the comrades quickly climbed the city wall, and he chased down and attacked the enemy. He knocked down four or five enemies with grenades, and he was also wounded, but he continued to charge and attack until he had completely eliminated the Chiang troops, seizing two rifles before returning.

    Two Cooks
    Wan Zhongbao and Cai Xiaoer, cooks of the 60544th, 4th Small Team, volunteered to rescue colored flags on the front line. Under the fierce artillery fire of the Chiang troops, they rescued six colored flags, and then they encountered five Chiang troops on the city wall. Wan Zhongbao shouted, "Surrender!" scaring the Chiang troops into hastily handing over five rifles and two hundred and twenty rounds of ammunition to them.

　　自卫英雄们
    计打邢家泉
    炮在邢家泉堡垒的五百米达地方架起来，可是天太黑，连这么近的地方，堡垒还是模模糊糊的，炮手感到困难，可是有人生出一计来。
    五个人背着一捆柴火悄悄的摸向堡垒去，所有的人都睁着眼送这五个人过去。五个人摸到了堡垒旁边，悄悄地先挖一个单人掩体。挖好掩护体后，四个人摸回来，丢下一个人守着柴火。
    炮手拉开炮等待着。这时五百米达外堡垒底下忽然一堆柴火烘烘的烧起来，照红了半个天，照红了堡垒，炮兵迅速瞄准，迅速射击，炮弹碰着堡垒上，火光四射，堡垒轰隆的摇摆着，里面的人叫起来。
    “缴枪！缴枪！”
    送出二十四支枪，又走出二十四个人。
    汾河
    刘建彬在汾河边上把守了多半夜，汾河的水“哗哗”响着，总没人从汾河对面渡过来，他有些心焦，眼睛瞪的大大的，盼望从汾河里冒出人来，活捉几个回去。
    约摸天明时候，人也有些疲倦，但河对面“扑咚！扑咚！”响起来，刘建彬看见河对面有数不清的黑黑一群人渡过来，而且很快的第一个冲过来的人，已经一把抓住自己的胳膀，刘建彬不慌不忙的喊着：“同志们冲啊！”埋伏在后面的十个人，同时爬出来，堵击这几十个人，刘建彬非常的沉着，先用手榴弹狠命的往抓住他的人头上一打，又顺手一刺刀，这人倒在河滩上，刘建彬又转过身来往左前边的人一刺刀。
    几十个人更慌张起来，回头跳往汾河里。刘建彬他们又集中射击起来。
    易开云巧捉俘虏
    对手的两门迫击炮和重机枪轻机枪，一股劲往易开云阵地轰击，汾河滩上的石头沙土，炸起了一二丈高又落到汾河里去，这对易开云的阵地没有损害，他们依然把守住汾河口，决不让汾河上渡过一个人去增援赵城。
    有些人会从机械的数目字去计算，一千余人对七八十人，这是一个大大的比例，可是这一千余人几次冲过来，易开云他们只用几颗手榴弹就迫他们退回去，来不及跑的就此死在河滩上。
    东山头露出一抹白光，八月早晨的阵阵凉风吹来有些凉意，但易开云他们没有一些感觉。
    远远有了吵闹声，城里逃出一伙敌人来拚命往汾河里跳，把他们的美国式大盖帽，背包，枪支及其他东西尽往汾河里抛，水上浮着，河底沉着，也有拦在河岸上。易开云他们赶快准备，前后都有敌人了，渡河过来的已经冲过来搅成一团，分不清敌我，易开云有些着急，可是没办法，这时又渡过来一批带有全付武器的敌人，易开云心生一计，就迎上去招呼：“来！来！这边是八路军，那边是咱们的人，快走，跟着快走…………”
    渡过河来的五六十人慌慌乱乱的跟着易开云走，有些人还沿路丢掉美国大盖帽，脱下美国式衣裳，把准备好了的老百姓衣服套在身上。咱们的易开云计划着，如果多骗过来些就好了。
    走过河滩，走过庄稼地，易开云往自己机枪阵地走去，后面的人也跟着走过来。
    易开云快到机枪阵地时紧走一步，跳过去嘱咐机枪射手：“注意！前面是敌人，射击！”机枪“哒哒哒”响开了，易开云喊着：“缴枪不杀！缴枪不杀！”六十多个人服服贴贴的缴了枪。
    两个模范指导员
    六○五四四小队政指李学堂同志，带着队伍反击到杞县城下时，腰部受伤仍英勇冲杀占领城楼，这时不幸脊背又受了伤，同志们要他下火线，他说：“不怕，同志们！我是轻伤，打吧！”他继续指挥队伍战斗。在巷战中，他头部又挂了彩还不肯下火线，他高呼“同志们！我们胜利了，敌人不投降就要他的命！”在同志们催促之下他才到救护所去换药。八小队副政指史书庭同志，在城内亲率五班向南追击蒋军，翻过许多房顶和围墙，突过火力封锁线，快到蒋军据以反扑的城楼时，他一个人冲上去，从敌人手里夺过来两挺轻机枪，一支捷克式步枪，一挺重机枪。
    登城第一名
    五四六小队殷公荣同志，是第一个抢登城墙的英雄，在动员会上他说：“这次打仗坚决完成任务？我在头里那怕牺牲完，只要有一个人也要上！”晚十二点十五分，一声山炮响起，架梯投弹往前攻，很快抬上梯子，殷公荣第一个上了城，不到五分钟他们全班都上了城，即与城上蒋军展开争夺战，情况甚为紧张，他高吼：“没有敌人啦！”全体同志很快爬上城墙，他便往下追击，他用手榴弹打倒四五个敌人，他也挂了彩，但他仍然冲杀，一直追击，直到完全消灭了蒋军，缴了两支步枪才回来。
    两个炊事员
    六○五四，四小队炊事员万中宝同蔡小二同志、自报奋勇到火线上抢救彩号，他们在蒋军猛烈的炮火下，抢救了六个彩号时，就在城墙上碰到五个蒋军，万中宝大喊一声“缴枪！”吓的蒋军急忙把五支步枪，二百二十发子弹交给他们。
