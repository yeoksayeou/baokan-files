The latter is being actively planned, and the former has received Chiang's "commendation" and will begin shipping within a month or two. The first batch of aircraft for air transport is expected to be about 20, with Shanghai as the starting point. All areas where UNRRA relief supplies are distributed are designated as route areas.
