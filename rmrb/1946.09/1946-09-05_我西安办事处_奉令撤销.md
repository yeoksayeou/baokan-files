　　My Xi'an Office
    Ordered to Be Abolished

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st】The Xi'an Office of the Eighteenth Group Army recently received an order from the Commander-in-Chief's Office of the First War Area, stipulating that it be abolished and reported by the end of August, and all personnel must return to their original units before September 10th. Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighteenth Group Army, yesterday telegraphed Zhou Zijian, Director of the Xi'an Office, and all personnel under his command to comply with the order and return to Yan'an. He also telegraphed Hu Zongnan, Commander-in-Chief, requesting him to allocate transportation and ensure safety along the way. The order from the Commander-in-Chief's Office of the First War Area was based on the order from Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of the National Defense Ministry of the Kuomintang, which required that all offices established by military organs in various places be abolished. According to news from Guanzhong: The Xi'an special service agency is planning some kind of atrocity, attempting to frame the Eighteenth Group Army Office, and use this as an excuse to forcibly seal off and arrest all personnel of the office. Yan'an hopes that the Xi'an authorities can be responsible for protecting the safety of all personnel of the office and ensuring their safe return to Yan'an. (Note: The Xi'an Office of the Eighteenth Group Army existed as a symbol of reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party as early as the end of 1936, but it has been subjected to severe oppression since the later period of the Anti-Japanese War. On August 6th, Director Zhou Zijian was publicly surrounded by Xi'an secret agents on the street and robbed of all clothing except his shirt.)

　　我西安办事处
    奉令撤销
    【新华社延安一日电】十八集团军西安办事处日前接到一战区司令长官部命令，限于八月底以前撤销具报，所有人员限于九月十日以前返回原部。十八集团军朱德总司令昨日已电令西安办事处周子健处长及所属人员遵令回延，并电请胡宗南司令长官拨给交通工具，并保障沿路安全。第一战区司令长官部的命令是根据国民党国防部参谋总长陈诚的命令，该命令要求所有军事机关在各地设立之办事处一律取销。另据关中消息：西安特务机关正在计划某种暴行，企图嫁祸于十八集团军办事处，并以此为借口强行封查和逮捕该办事处全体人员。延安方面希望西安当局能负责保护该办事处全体人员安全回延。（按：十八集团军西安办事处早在民国二十五年底就作为国共和解之象征而开始存在，但自抗战后期以至于今，备受严酷压迫，八月六日周子健处长曾被西安特务在大街上公开包围，劫去衬衣以外的全部衣物）。
