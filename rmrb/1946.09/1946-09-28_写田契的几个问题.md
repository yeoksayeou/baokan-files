Several Issues in Writing Land Contracts
　　You Chao
　　Establishing contracts confirming property rights is one of the issues farmers value after the fruit of the distribution struggle. I am providing the following specific issues about writing contracts that I researched in the Shitan Goose Money Township in Huai'an for everyone's reference:
　　(1) Establish the masses' legal concept of the new contract. In the movement against illegal exploitation, because some local despots and landlords fled, tenants could not settle old accounts with them face-to-face. The reasonable accounts put forward by the tenants could not be recognized by the landlords in person. As a result, the tenants could not truly trust the transfer of property rights. Coupled with an insufficient understanding of the illegality of landlords' feudal exploitation, and the rumors and sabotage of reactionary pawns, some tenants developed thoughts such as "With the democratic government in place, contracts don't matter; when the reactionaries come, contracts are useless," and "Old contracts are not produced, new contracts are difficult to rely on." Therefore, during the movement, in addition to trying our best to have tenants settle accounts with landlords face-to-face and sign contracts, we should also strengthen current affairs education, emphasizing that feudal exploitation is illegal and that the land was earned by our ancestors with blood and sweat, so that they can establish the legal concept that "old contracts are invalid, and new contracts are always valid" and consolidate the idea of ​​emancipation.
　　(2) Respecting the habits of the masses when writing contracts can also increase the masses' attention to and legal perception of the new contracts. For example, places where typos are corrected should be stamped, and if the old contract is lost, it should be stated as invalid on the new contract. It is best to publish it in the newspaper, and the old contract should be taken out and burned. It is a groundbreaking happy event for tenants to buy the property of landlords. It is also necessary to have a cup of wedding wine and say "Congratulations on a great harvest," etc. We should listen to the opinions of the masses and write down the specific circumstances of each person in as much detail as possible to avoid any concerns.
　　(3) Intermediaries and signing issues. The intermediary should be found by the buyer himself, and should not be monopolized by several fruit disposal committee members, otherwise it will cause the masses to not pay attention to it and be worried. According to my understanding of their habits, they do not look for agricultural association cadres or neighbors, but some look for people who have relationships with landlords to serve as intermediaries.
　　It is best for the landlord himself to sign. If he is not present, he can be represented by an agent, accountant, manager, steward, or other relevant person. If none of them are present, the tenant should submit the contract and list of accounts to the county government for record and approval, and a license will be issued. The property of traitors should be confiscated by the government and a management license issued; there is no need to write a contract.
　　(4) Improve the status of women through writing contracts. Although women are divided equally with men when distributing the fruits of struggle, the impact on people is not great enough. The masses think it's just counting a share (and the woman herself thinks so), so in order to recognize that women have property rights, women's names should be listed when writing the contract, stating that women also have the right to make decisions about property, in order to improve their economic status. This is also a good opportunity to organize and educate women.
　　(5) Writing contracts must not be done in a blitzkrieg manner, completely monopolized and replaced by cadres. For example, invite a few scholars, put the contracts together in a concentrated manner, copy them according to the list, and then find an intermediary (several disposal committee members), and after the landlord or agent signs, distribute them to the masses. This not only obliterates the struggle between tenants and landlords in writing contracts, and abandons a good opportunity for education and unity, but also easily misleads the masses into thinking that the contract was issued by the government. On the other hand, we cannot think that writing contracts is only a matter of verbatim copying, and completely ignore it, letting the masses do it themselves, without helping to solve difficulties (such as finding a scholar, asking the landlord to sign, etc.), and without answering doubts. This will affect the morale of the masses. We should help the masses solve difficulties, guide the masses to take the initiative to do it themselves, and let them discuss: "How to write so that there is no verbosity," "Who should be asked to be the intermediary," "Is the new contract legal," and use the power of the masses to break through concerns and difficulties, so that they believe that the new contract is the "root of the rice bowl," and a legitimate one bought back by the ancestral blood and sweat debt, which no one can encroach on.
　　(6) Tax deed issues. The masses attach great importance to tax deeds, believing that this is obtaining the government's recognition and guarantee of their property rights, which they value more than paying land tax. However, some people are afraid of taxes because they have no money. However, if the tax deed does not cost money, the masses will be surprised because there is no precedent, and even suspect the validity of the deed. According to the actual situation, the tax rate is best within a few thousandths of the field price.
　　It can be seen from the above specific issues that writing contracts is not a simple copying job, but an organizational education work to establish the masses' legal concept of the new contract and consolidate the masses' ideology of permanent emancipation.

### 写田契的几个问题

　　写田契的几个问题
　　尤超
    订立确认产权的契约是分配斗争果实后农民所重视的问题之一，兹将我在淮安石塘鹅钱乡所研究的关于写契约的几个具体问题，提供大家参考：
    （一）确立群众对新契的合法观念。在反对非法剥削运动中，因有部分恶霸地主逃亡在外，佃户不能与他们面对面的算清旧帐，佃户提出的合理账目不能获得地主当面承认，以至佃户对产权的转移，还不能确实信任。加上对地主封建剥削的非法性的认识不够清楚，及反动派爪牙的造谣破坏，因此部分佃户，就发生“民主政府在，没契也不要紧，反动派来，有契也不管事。”“老契不拿出，新契难为凭”等思想，故在运动过程中，除尽可能地做到佃户与地主当面算账，写契签字外，还应加强时事教育，着重指出封建剥削是非法的，土地是自己祖代血汗换来的，使其建立“老契作废，新契永远有效”的合法观念，巩固翻身思想。
    （二）写契时尊重群众的习惯，亦可使群众增加对新契的重视和合法观念。如改正错字的地方应盖章，如老契遗失在新契上应说明作废，最好能登报，把旧契应拿出烧毁。佃户买地主的产是破天荒的大喜事，吃杯喜酒，说声“恭喜丰收大吉”等亦是必要的，要多听群众意见，将各人的具体情形尽可能详细写上，以免有所顾虑。
    （三）中人与签字问题。中人应由买户自己去找，不应由几个果实处理委员包办，否则会引起群众的不重视与顾虑。据我了解他们的习惯，不是找农会干部、邻居，有的则找与地主有关系的人担任。
    签字最好是地主本人签，如其本人不在，可由代理人或管账、经理、庄头及其他有关人物代表；若都不在，便由佃户将契与账目清单呈县府备案、批准，发给执照。汉奸田产则应由政府没收，发给管业执照，不须写契。
    （四）通过写契，提高妇女地位。在分配斗争果实时，虽女人与男人一样的分，但给人的影响还不够大，群众以为只是算一口子吧了（连女的本人也是如此想），为承认女性有产权，写契时应将女的名字列上，说明女的对财产也有权作主，以提高她们的经济地位，这也是组织与教育妇女的一个好机会。
    （五）写契决不能以突击方式，完全由干部包办代替，如请几位先生，把契集中在一起，照开好的清单抄，再找中人（几个处理委员），地主或代理人签过字后，发给群众。这样不但抹煞了佃户与地主在写契中的斗争，放弃了很好的教育团结机会，且易使群众误解契是政府发的。另一面也不能认为写契仅是原文照抄的事务事情，完全不闻不问，由群众自己去搞，有困难不帮助解决（如找先生、请地主签字等），有疑虑不解答，这会影响群众情绪。我们应帮助群众解决困难，引导群众自己主动去做，由他们自己讨论：“怎样写才不会有啰嗦”、“请那些人做中人”、“新契是否合法”，用群众的力量来打破顾虑与困难，使其认为新契就是“饭碗根子”，是祖代血汗债买回来的合法的，任何人不得侵夺的。
    （六）税契问题。群众对税契非常重视，认为这是获得政府对他产权的承认与保障，比纳土地税还看得重视，但也有些人因无钱而怕税，但如税契不要钱，群众反而会因无前例而奇怪，甚至会怀疑到契的效力，根据实际情况，税率最好在田价的千分之几的范围内。
    从上面几个具体问题上看出，写契并不是单纯的抄写工作，而是一件组织教育确立群众对新契的合法观念，巩固群众永远翻身思想的工作。
