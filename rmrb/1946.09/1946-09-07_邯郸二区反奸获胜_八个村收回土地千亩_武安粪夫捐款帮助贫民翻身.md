[This report from our newspaper, Handan] The unprecedented mass anti-traitor movement in the second district of Handan has now come to an end. Over the course of twelve days, more than eighty anti-traitor accusation meetings were held, with the participation of 40,000 people. In over eighty administrative villages, many traitorous elements and puppets were purged. In just forty-eight administrative villages, including Shitong, Libao, Dinanbao, and Jiazhuang, there were eight hundred and seven people, including the president of the puppet "China Civilian Cotton Production Improvement Association" and personnel from puppet armies and organizations. Under the government's policy of leniency towards confession and the pressure of the people, the vast majority, except for a few die-hard major traitors, confessed and bowed their heads. They have realized: "Eating Chinese food, wearing Chinese clothes, and working for the enemy is truly betraying our ancestors and letting down our fellow villagers." When they thought about how six enemies were able to rule the second district of Handan for eight years entirely with the help of traitors, they felt even more deeply the gravity of their sins! They have now sworn to the masses to turn over a new leaf. During the anti-traitor struggle, eighty-one despots, secret agents, and illegal landlords were also purged, greatly weakening their feudal rule in the countryside. The masses received unprecedented training in the struggle. Forty-four percent of the villages in the district can now independently carry out further rent reduction movements. The membership of peasant associations has also generally increased sharply, and a large number of activists have emerged. Women's associations and sister groups have also begun to be established in more than seventy villages. The masses have gained considerable economic benefits in the anti-traitor struggle. Just eight villages, including Gaolibao, have recovered more than 1,100 mu of land, 3,200 jin of grain, more than 2 million in cash, and 13 long and short guns.

[This report from our newspaper, Wu'an, 5th] Night soil collectors here, with a high degree of class solidarity and fraternal spirit, donated more than 400,000 yuan to help poor people overturn their lives. After the liberation last autumn, the forty-odd night soil collectors in nineteen streets of Wu'an City were freed from the various harsh taxes and levies of the enemy puppet regime. Under the leadership of the Night Soil Collectors' Union, they carried out an anti-traitor revenge and emancipation movement, greatly improving their lives. Recently, they also recovered 800,000 yuan in blood and sweat that had been illegally exploited by the feudal landlord (large dung yard owner) Li Qiming. When distributing this achievement, they unanimously believed that they already had enough to eat and wear, but many class brothers in the streets had not yet turned over. They said, "Poor people all over the world are one family. United, we are strong. Let's help those who can't stand up." Everyone unanimously decided to donate 250,000 yuan from the 800,000 to help poor urban residents turn over their lives. Li Dingxian, chairman of the Night Soil Collectors' Union, said, "Only when everyone has turned over can our interests be consolidated." So he took out 8,000 yuan from the 18,000 yuan he received. Under his influence, the night soil collectors made individual donations one after another, with twenty-eight people donating 160,500 yuan, totaling 410,500 yuan, which has now been entirely handed over to the Civilian Association for proper distribution.

    八个村收回土地千亩
    武安粪夫捐款帮助贫民翻身
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸二区规模空前的群众反奸运动，现已告一段落，在十二天中，共开反奸控诉大会八十余次，参加者达四万人。有八十个以上行政村清洗出许多奸伪分子，仅史东、里堡、堤南堡、贾庄等四十八个行政村，即达八百零七人包括伪华民棉产改进会长及伪军伪组织人员，他们在政府的坦白宽大政策及人民的压力下，除少数死心踏地的大汉奸外，绝大部分已坦白认错和低头，他们已认识到：“吃中国人饭，穿中国人衣，给敌人办事，真是出卖了祖宗又对不起乡亲们。”当他们想到八年来六个敌人得以统治邯郸二区完全是汉奸的帮助就更加感到自己的罪恶深重了！现已向群众宣誓要重作好人。在反奸中同时清算了恶霸、特务及不法地主八十一名，大大的削弱了他们在农村的封建统治，群众在斗争中受到了空前的锻炼，全区已有百分之四十四的村庄，可单独开展进一步清算租息运动。农会会员也普遍激增，积极分子大批涌现，妇女会，姐妹团也在七十多个村庄开始成立起来。群众在反奸中获得相当的经济利益，仅高丽堡等八个村即收回土地一千一百多亩，粮食三千二百斤，现款二百余万，长短枪十三枝。

    【本报武安五日讯】此间粪夫以高度的阶级团结友爱精神捐款四十余万元帮助穷人翻身。武安城十九街四十余粪夫，于去秋解放后，解除了敌伪统治时期的各种苛杂勒索，并在粪夫工会领导下进行了反奸复仇的翻身运动，生活大为改善；最近又向封建场主（大粪场主）李启明索回被非法剥削去的血汗账八十万元。在分配此项果实时，一致认为自己已有吃有穿了，可是街里许多阶级弟兄还没有翻转身，他们说：“天下穷人是一家，团结起来力量大，站不起来的扶扶他”，大家一致决议从八十万里捐出二十五万元帮助穷苦市民翻身。粪夫工会主席李定贤说：“只有大家都翻了身，我们的利益才能巩固”，于是他又从自己分的一万八千元里拿出八千元。在他的影响下，粪夫们又纷纷个别捐助，计二十八人捐款十六万零五百元，共合四十一万零五百元，现已全数送交平民会，并请其妥为分配。
