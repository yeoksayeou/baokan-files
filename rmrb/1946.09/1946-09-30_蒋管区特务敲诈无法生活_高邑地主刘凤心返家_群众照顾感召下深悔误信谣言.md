　　Jiang-controlled area special agents extort so much that people cannot live.
　　Gaoyi landlord Liu Fengxin returns home.
　　Deeply regrets believing rumors under the care and influence of the masses.
[Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] Liu Fengxin, a landlord who fled from Xidi, Gaoyi, returned to his home recently because he could not make a living in the Jiang-controlled area. In the past, Liu, misled by rumors, attempted to evade the mass movement and fled to Shimen last winter. In Shimen, rice was as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, with millet costing 4,000 per dou and steamed buns 800 per jin. Moreover, special agents extorted and officials demanded bribes. The money Liu had brought quickly ran out. Although there were no shortage of old friends and relatives, there was no one to turn to for a loan. He was forced to sell his clothes to buy carrots to satisfy his hunger. In March of this year, he became a small vendor selling candy, but he still could not make a living. In addition to suffering from cold and hunger, Liu painfully realized that he had no freedom to live or work. He decided to return to the liberated area. After Liu arrived home, the villagers all came to express their sympathy and took care of his life in various ways. Seeing that in less than a year since he left home, everyone in the village had enough to eat and wear, and the place was full of abundance and joy, he couldn't help but sigh with emotion and said to everyone he met: "Anyone who wants to run away will surely die. I will never be fooled again!"

　　蒋管区特务敲诈无法生活
　　高邑地主刘凤心返家
　　群众照顾感召下深悔误信谣言
    【本报长治讯】高邑西堤逃亡地主刘凤心因在蒋管区无法生活，已于日前重返家园。过去刘因误信谣言，企图逃避群众运动，于去冬逃亡石门。石门米珠薪桂，小米每斗四千，馒头每斤八百，加以特务敲诈，官吏勒索，刘所携现款瞬即告罄，虽不乏旧日亲朋，却无门可以告贷，乃被迫变卖衣物以红萝卜充饥；至今年三月复充当小夫贩卖糖果，仍不能糊口。刘冻馁之余复痛感居住谋生均无自由，乃决心重返解放区。刘抵家后村人咸往慰问并多方照顾他的生活，他看见自己离家不及一年，村中已人人有吃有穿，到处充满丰足欢乐景象，不禁感慨系之的逢人便说：“谁要跑出去，非死没法，以后我再不会上这当了！”
