　　Nationalists Soldiers and Officers, Arise and Refuse to Fight!
    When General Gao Shuxun led the New Eighth Army in Jinnan at the end of last October to raise the banner of anti-civil war, and when General Pan Shuoduan led the 184th Division to stage the Haicheng Uprising at the end of May this year, we called on the patriotic officers and soldiers in the Nationalist army to follow the example of Generals Gao and Pan and withdraw from the civil war and stand on the side of the people. At that time, we also warned the reactionaries within the Kuomintang that if they insisted on civil war and expanded the civil war, more Gao Shuxuns and Pan Shuoduan Generals would appear in the Kuomintang army. The reactionaries did not accept our warning, and our prediction has been increasingly confirmed by facts. In the past eight months of this year, in addition to General Pan Shuoduan, those who launched anti-civil war uprisings also included all the officers and soldiers under Generals Hao Pengju, Kong Congzhou, Cao Yousan, Lei Wenqing, Wang Haiqing, etc., as well as Captains Liu Shanben and Zhang Shouyi, who flew American-made giant bombers to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war. Since the beginning of July, Chiang Kai-shek has been fighting the civil war even more vigorously, but the war-weariness of his subordinates has also increased. Major General Xi Shengkai, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 92nd Brigade, who went on strike during the Yugou campaign, said: "When I heard the sound of civil war gunfire, my mood dropped to freezing point." On the front lines, thousands of Nationalist officers and soldiers felt that the road to civil war was impassable, and they either went on strike, refused to fight, or laid down their weapons and withdrew from the civil war, or turned their guns around and helped the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas to repel the invaders. If we take a comprehensive look, the Nationalist officers and soldiers who actually went on strike in various places included not only officers and soldiers of the "non-direct line" troops such as the Northwest Army, the Yunnan Army, the Northeast Army, and the Sichuan Army, but also officers and soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops; not only officers and soldiers of the army and air force personnel, but also naval personnel (a squad from the "Changzhi" ship in the Bohai Sea took a motorboat and defected to the Eighth Route Army) and technical arms personnel (Lieutenant Zhang Jianying of the 1st Company, 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment of the Armored Corps Training Column, defected to the Liberated Area with a tank during the Lanfeng campaign). Even Wang Yifan's unit of the armed "Transportation Brigade," personally trained by the secret agent boss Dai Li, withdrew from the civil war as a whole and stood on the side of the people. This strike movement of Nationalist officers and soldiers is a concrete manifestation of the nationwide angry tide against civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal. Precisely because of this, this movement is irresistible; it has extremely broad prospects for development. At present, this movement is just beginning. It will develop into a larger-scale and more conscious movement and become an important factor in completely smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.
    From the recent conversations of many Nationalist officers and soldiers who went on strike, we know that the reasons for their strike are mainly twofold: first, the War of Resistance against Japan has been won, and everyone is willing to retire and return home to live and work in peace, and no one is willing to risk their lives for the dictator and die in vain in the civil war. Second, participating in the War of Resistance against Japan was glorious, while participating in the anti-people civil war and using foreign weapons to massacre compatriots is the most dishonorable and contrary to conscience. This righteous patriotic sentiment is growing among the vast number of Nationalist officers and soldiers. From the conversations of the Nationalist soldiers and officers on strike, we also know that Chiang Kai-shek's deception of his officers and soldiers is decreasing day by day. Chiang Kai-shek wants his officers and soldiers to believe that the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas are all "bandits" and "a rabble," but when they come into contact with the Liberated Areas, they quickly understand the truth. For example, the telegram from more than two hundred Chiang soldiers and officers on strike in Tianchang said: "Officers and soldiers in the Liberated Areas are equal, everything is reasonable, there is no beating or scolding, the military and civilians are united, life is free, and the supply of clothing, food, and utensils is better than in the Kuomintang areas." In order to prevent his officers and soldiers from joining hands with the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas, Chiang Kai-shek also fabricated rumors that "the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army either bury prisoners alive or skin them," but when the Nationalist officers and soldiers see the facts, no one believes these rumors. Liu Zhemin, deputy battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the New 7th Brigade, who went on strike in the Libao battle, said: "When I learned about the New Fourth Army's preferential treatment of soldiers on strike, who would be willing to make unnecessary sacrifices!"
    All the patriotic officers and soldiers in the Nationalist army, you can think about it, why does Chiang Kai-shek want to fight the civil war? He wants to fight the civil war not only to destroy the bright Liberated Areas, but also to maintain his dictatorial rule and make the dark Kuomintang-controlled areas even darker. The people there are already eating grass roots, bark, and Guanyin soil, but in order to fight the great civil war, Chiang Kai-shek is even more anxious to collect grain and conscript soldiers. Among the millions of starving people there, aren't there your parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives among you Nationalist soldiers? If you continue to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's civil war orders, then aren't you not only making unnecessary sacrifices yourself, but also making your families and compatriots in the Chiang-controlled areas make unnecessary sacrifices?
    We, the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas, hope that you will wake up quickly and jump out of the fire pit of civil war. We are carrying out resolute self-defense counterattacks against Chiang Kai-shek's mad attacks, and at the same time, we are willing to work with all of you patriotic Nationalist soldiers and officers who are unwilling to fight the civil war to stop Chiang Kai-shek's crime of plunging the people of the whole country into an unprecedented disaster. If you resolutely refuse Chiang Kai-shek's reckless orders, withdraw from the civil war, and stand on the side of the people, we will warmly welcome you, just as we welcomed General Gao Shuxun, General Pan Shuoduan, and other patriotic people who launched anti-civil war uprisings. We are also willing to suggest that you take various measures to implement strikes and refusals to fight according to specific circumstances. On the front lines, you can fire your guns into the sky, and go home whenever you have the opportunity. You can also agree to a truce with the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas and hold a joint celebration. We also hope that you will think about it, the tanks, guns, cannons, airplanes, and other weapons that Chiang Kai-shek issued to you were all obtained from American imperialism at the cost of selling out China's sovereignty. It is best that you can take these weapons and stand on the side of the people, turning the weapons of civil war into weapons against civil war; if the time is not yet ripe, you can also destroy these weapons in various ways. For example, army guns, bullets, artillery shells, and air force bombs can be aimed at uninhabited areas, which will not harm residents and can achieve the purpose of massively consuming civil war ammunition. Furthermore, the equipment of mechanized corps and air force can be skillfully damaged and consumed, making it difficult to repair and replenish.
    Patriotic officers and soldiers of the Nationalist army, your strike movement is not isolated and helpless, and the people of the whole country are willing to give you assistance. The more efforts you make in this direction, the more the strength of the anti-civil war movement of the people of the whole country will increase, Chiang Kai-shek's civil war plan will collapse sooner, the peace of the whole country will be restored sooner, and the day you return home to live a peaceful life will come sooner.

### 国民党军官兵，起来罢战怠战！

　　国民党军官兵，起来罢战怠战！
    在去年十月底高树勋将军在冀南率领新八军高举反内战义旗、今年五月底潘朔端将军率领一八四师举行海城起义时，我们都曾号召国民党军队里的爱国官兵学高潘等将军的榜样，退出内战，站到人民方面来。当时我们并警告国民党内反动派，如果他们坚持内战，扩大内战，国民党军队里将出现更多的高树勋和潘朔端将军。反动派没有接受我们的警告，而我们的预言也日益被事实所证实。今年八个月内，除了潘朔端将军以外，举行反内战起义的，还有郝鹏举、孔从周、曹又参、雷文清、王海清等将军所部全体官兵，以及刘善本、张受益上尉驾驶美制巨型轰炸机来延安，退出内战。七月初以来，蒋介石打内战打得更起劲了，可是他的部下的厌战情绪也更加增长了。在渔沟战役罢战的九十二旅副旅长洗盛楷少将说：“我听到内战枪声一响，心绪即降到冰点”。在火线上，成千成百的国民党官兵，觉得打内战的路走不通，纷纷怠战罢战，或则放下武器，退出内战，或则掉转枪头，帮助解放区军民打退进犯者。如果我们综合起来一看，各地国民党军官兵实际罢战的，不仅有西北军、滇军、东北军、川军等“非嫡系”部队的官兵，而且也还有蒋介石嫡系部队的官兵；不仅有陆军的官兵和空军人员，而且还有海军人员（渤海海面“长治”号一个班乘汽艇投八路军）和技术兵种的人员（兰封战役中装甲兵团教导纵队二团一营一连张剑萤少尉驾驶坦克投解放区）。甚至特务头子戴笠亲手训练的武装“交通大队”王一藩部亦整队退出内战，站到人民方面来。国民党军官兵这一怠战罢战运动，是全国反内战反独裁反卖国的怒潮的一种具体表现。正因为如此，这个运动是不可压抑的；它有极其宽广的发展前途。目前这个运动还正在开始。它将发展成为更大规模的和更自觉的运动，并成为彻底粉碎蒋介石进攻的一个重要因素。
    从最近许多罢战的国民党军官兵的谈话中，我们知道他们罢战的原因，主要不外两端：第一，抗战胜利了，谁都愿意退伍回家，安居乐业，谁都不愿意替独裁者拚命，在内战中白白送死。第二，参加抗日战争是光荣的，而参加反人民内战，拿着外国武器屠杀同胞，是最不光荣的和最违背良心的。这种正义的爱国的情绪，正在广大国民党军官兵中日益滋长起来。从国民党军罢战官兵的谈话中，又可以知道蒋介石对他的官兵的欺骗，其效用正在天天减少。蒋介石要他的官兵相信解放区军民都是“匪”，都是“乌合之众”，但是当他们一和解放区接触时，他们就很快了解真相。例如在天长罢战的蒋军二百余官兵的通电说：“解放区官兵平等，一切讲理，不打不骂，军民团结，生活自由，穿衣吃饭用具供给，都比国民党地区好。”蒋介石为了防止他的官兵和解放区军民携手，又捏造“八路军新四军对俘虏不是活埋，就是剥皮”的谣言，但当国民党军官兵看到事实的时候，便谁也不信这种谣言了。在李堡战斗中罢战的新七旅二十一团二营副营长刘哲民就说：“当知道新四军优待罢战官兵的消息时，谁还愿意作无谓的牺牲！”
    国民党军队里的一切爱国官兵们，你们可以想一想，蒋介石究意为什么要打内战？他要打内战，不仅是为了要毁灭光明的解放区，而且是为了维持他的独裁统治，使黑暗的国民党统治区更加黑暗。那里的老百姓已经在吃草根树皮，吃观音土，但是蒋介石为了打大内战，征粮征丁，更加急如星火。在那里千百万饥民中间，还不是有你们国民党军官兵的父母兄弟姊妹吗？你们如果继续执行蒋介石的内战命令，那么你们岂不是不只自己作无谓的牺牲，而且还要自己的家属和蒋管区的同胞都作无谓的牺牲吗？
    我们解放区军民希望你们赶快醒觉起来，赶快跳出内战的火坑。我们对蒋介石的疯狂进攻，正在进行坚决的自卫反击，同时我们愿意和你们一切不愿意打内战的国民党军爱国官兵携手合作，来制止蒋介石把全国同胞陷入空前大灾难的罪行。你们如果毅然决然拒绝蒋介石的乱命，退出内战，站到人民方面来，我们将如欢迎高树勋、潘朔端等将军及其他反内战起义的志士们一样，热烈地欢迎你们。我们还愿意向你们建议根据具体情况采取各种各样的方式实行罢战怠战。在火线上，你们可以枪口朝天放，一有机会就跑回家去，你们还可以和解放区军民相约休战，进行联欢。我们还希望你们想一想，蒋介石发给你们的坦克、枪炮、飞机等武器，都是他以出卖中国主权的条件从美国帝国主义那里拿来的。你们最好能够拿着这些武器站到人民方面来，把内战的武器转变成为反内战的武器；如果时机还未成熟，也还可以用各种方法毁损这些武器。例如陆军的枪弹炮弹和空军的炸弹可以向无人的地区瞄准，既不损害居民，又可达到大量消耗内战弹药之目的。又如机械化兵团和空军的设备，都可以巧妙地加以破坏耗损，使其修不胜修，难于补给。
    国民党军的爱国官兵们，你们的罢战怠战运动不是孤立无助的，全国同胞都愿意给你们以援助。你们向这个方向多努力一分，全国同胞反内战运动的力量就会增加一分，蒋介石的内战计划就会早日垮台，全国的和平就会早日恢复，你们回家过和平生活的日子就会更快的到来。
