　　Huo County Decorated with Lanterns and Banners
　　Two Myriad People Gather to Celebrate Liberation
　　Masses in the Hong, Zhao, and Huo New District Launch Revenge and Liquidation
　　[Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 4th dispatch] On September 1st, a celebration of liberation was held in Huo County. The streets were decorated with lanterns and banners, like celebrating the New Year. One couplet read, "Liberated, live freely and lively; Victorious, talk, laugh, and be happy." Farmers from as far as thirty miles away dressed up with Yangko dance teams and music bands, with gongs and drums shaking the sky, and came to the city in droves. There were more than 20,000 people, an unprecedentedly lively scene in Huo County. At 1:00 PM, the conference was held at the airport. First, the people of Huo County presented the Eighth Route Army with a bright banner, which read: "Not to Take a Needle or Thread from the People." Comrade Guan Ziping, the representative of the Communist Party in Huo County, spoke amidst the cheers of the people. He said, "In the past nine years, Huo County has sacrificed more than 1,750 mass cadres, and 350,000 shi of grain have been seized. We have suffered to the extreme. Now that we are liberated, we must defend it with our flesh and blood." Afterwards, people's representatives spoke successively, expressing their willingness to support the front line with all their strength. They were extremely grateful to the democratic government for allocating 500 shi of wheat to relieve 5,000 refugees in the city.
　　[Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 6th dispatch] The mass movement of complaining about suffering and seeking revenge in the newly liberated areas of Hong (tong), Zhao (cheng), and Huo (county) is underway. After the liberation of Hongtong, thousands of people went to the gate of the court every day, requesting that war criminals be handed over to the masses for democratic liquidation. Our democratic government has approved their request to bring back more than 30 wicked traitors, secret agents, and puppet police captains, including Meng Qinren, Chou Jinmei, and Zhang Keming. People from nearby counties also came from afar, demanding that the war criminals who had fled to Hongtong from their respective counties be brought back, including more than 40 people from Linfen, Anze and other counties, such as Shi Fengtong, Wang Chenli, and Li Shichen. The movement of complaining about suffering and seeking revenge inside and outside Huo County is developing extremely rapidly. Liquidation struggles have been launched in dozens of villages.
