　　Hired Laborer Zhang Laitan Actively Produces
    Employer-Employee Profit Sharing Praised by All
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] In Nan Yigu Village, Fifth District of this county, hired laborer Zhang Laitan has increased his production enthusiasm due to the implementation of "employer-employee profit sharing." He cultivated a total of 27.5 mu of land. In the year's mutual aid production, in addition to completing his own production, others still owed him a lot of work. He worked quickly and well, and when exchanging labor with others, he was worth one and a half laborers. Everyone was happy to exchange labor with him. Last year, with the labor he saved, he transported salt three times, earning 8,500 yuan. This year, he transported it once again, earning 2,000 yuan. The money he earned was shared "two-eight" with the boss (the capital and expenses were all the boss's). Later, the masses of the village elected him as a member of the village trade union committee. He said, "In the future, I must organize all the hired laborers and cowherds in the village together to ensure the completion of the government's production call."

　　雇工张来潭积极生产
    主雇分红人人说好
    【本报阳城讯】本县五区南宜固村雇工张来潭，由于实行“主雇分红”，生产情绪提高。他共种了廿七亩半地，在全年的互助生产中，除完成自己的生产外，别人还短他很多工，他做活又快又好。和别人变工一个顶个半劳力，大家都高兴和他变工，去年省下的工，他运了三次盐，赚了八千五百元。今年又运了一次，赚了两千元。所赚的钱就和掌柜“二八分红”。（本钱盘费都是掌柜的）后来全村群众选他为全村工会常委。他说：“今后我一定要把全村雇工、放牛娃一齐组织起来，保证完成政府的生产号召。”
