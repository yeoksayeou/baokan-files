Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: According to reliable sources, Chiang Kai-shek has committed 90% of his entire naval, land, and air force strength to the civil war front lines, leaving only 10% to defend the vast rear areas of fifteen or sixteen provinces under Kuomintang rule. This illustrates the unprecedented scale of the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek and indicates that his troop deployment has reached its limit. In terms of the army: Chiang Kai-shek has a total of 91 regular army corps comprising 256 divisions (past statistics indicated 253 divisions, but it has now been confirmed that the newly formed 10th Division, Provisional 12th Division, and 184th Division have been reinstated), approximately 2,060,000 men. 74 corps comprising 208 divisions, totaling 1,740,000 men, are being used to attack the Liberated Areas. This accounts for 85% of the entire regular army. If local militia are included, the percentage is even greater. In terms of the navy: Chiang Kai-shek has three fleets and two flotillas, with 90% committed to the civil war, except for a small portion stationed in the South China Sea. In terms of the air force: all eight air force contingents of Chiang Kai-shek are being used to attack the Liberated Areas; recently, they have been particularly bombing the industrial facilities, river embankments, hospitals, schools, and railways of the Liberated Areas. However, the extent of the depletion of Chiang Kai-shek's strength in the civil war is also extremely alarming. In the "forceful final decision" against the Soviet-Anhui Liberated Area over just one and a half months, eight brigades (original divisions) were eliminated. And from mid-July to the end of August, a total of 170,000 men were lost on all battlefields, accounting for one-twelfth of his entire army strength. Chiang Kai-shek is now conscripting soldiers everywhere, planning to expand his forces by 200,000 men in the Northeast, Beiping-Tianjin, and Shanxi regions in the short term. Because the people are extremely disgusted with the civil war and unwilling to serve as cannon fodder, Chiang Kai-shek is unscrupulously using the "Youth Army" as a guise to lure out-of-school and unemployed youth. However, it is generally believed that no matter what means Chiang Kai-shek uses to expand his forces and conscript soldiers, he will absolutely not be able to fill the huge losses of the civil war.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 5th: During the defense of Meitianshan in the Zibo mining area, the Liu Guangrong squad of the Qian unit of the Eighth Route Army in central Shandong, in the last five minutes of withdrawing from combat, braved intense artillery fire and threw their squad's only grenade into a blockhouse held by a platoon of Chiang's troops. This immediately silenced the Chiang army's artillery fire, resulting in the capture of seven Chiang soldiers, and the seizure of one American-made rocket launcher and one mortar, as well as three American-style machine guns, creating a glorious example of achieving victory with fewer troops and seizing American weaponry to equip themselves. The entire division is now launching a mass movement to "talk about heroes, write about heroes, and learn from heroes," emulating the Liu Guangrong squad. The saying of Commander Qian, calling for a resolute attack on the invading army, is spreading throughout every company: "Even if it's a tiger, we will pull out its fangs!"

　　蒋介石实力消耗巨大
    一个半月损兵十七万
    鲁中我军一个班创造以少胜多范例
    【新华社延安四日电】据可靠方面统计，蒋介石已以其全部海陆空军实力的百分之九十投入内战前线，只留下百分之十的力量防守国民党统治区十五六个省份的广大后方地区。这说明这次蒋介石所发动的内战规模之空前巨大，也告诉人们他的兵力已用到极限。陆军方面：蒋介石共有正规军九十一个军二百五十六个师（过去统计是二百五十三个师，现证明又恢复了新编第十师、暂十二师、一百八十四师等三个师）约二百零六万人。用于进攻解放区者达七十四个军二百零八个师，一百七十四万人，以上即占全部正规陆军的百分之八十五。如果把地方团队计算在内，百分比当更大。海军方面：蒋介石有三个舰队二个小队，除少部分留置南海外，百分之九十已用于内战。空军方面：蒋介石的八个空军大陆全部用于进攻解放区；最近特别轰炸解放区的工业设备、河防堤岸、医院、学校和铁道公路。但蒋介石实力在内战中消耗之大亦极惊人。仅对苏皖解放区一个半月的“武力决赛”中，就打掉了八个旅（原师）。而自七月中旬至八月底止，各战场共损失了十七万人，占其全部陆军兵力的十二分之一。现蒋介石正在到处抓丁拉夫，预定在东北、平津、山西三个地区短期内就要扩兵二十万人。由于人民对内战极度厌恶，不愿充当炮灰，蒋介石不惜以“青年军”作幌子来勾引失学失业的青年上钩。但一般认为，蒋介石无论用什么手段来扩兵征丁，仍然绝对无法填补其内战的巨大消耗。
    【新华社临沂五日电】鲁中八路军钱部刘光荣班，在淄博矿区煤天山自卫战中，全班于撤出战斗的最后五分钟内冒密集炮火以全班仅有的一颗手榴弹投入蒋军一个排负隅据守的炮楼内，使蒋军炮火立即静寂，活捉蒋军七名，缴获美制火箭炮及迫击炮各一门，美式机枪三挺，创造以少胜多，夺取美械武器以装备自己的光辉范例。现全师正展开“说英雄写英雄学英雄”的群众运动，向刘光荣班看齐。每个连队传布着钱师长号召坚决打击进犯军的一句话：“即使它是只老虎，我们也要拔掉它的门牙！”
