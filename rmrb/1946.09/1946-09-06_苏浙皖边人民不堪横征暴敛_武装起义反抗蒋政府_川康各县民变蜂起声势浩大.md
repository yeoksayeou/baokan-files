Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd—Recently, the people of Yixing (belonging to Jiangsu), Guangde (belonging to Anhui), Changxing (belonging to Zhejiang) and other counties on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, unable to bear the heavy taxes and levies of Chiang Kai-shek's "evil government," have been provoked to armed resistance. The masses in the uprising, led by Wang Shoupeng and Tang Songlin, killed Xu of the Kuomintang militia of Dajian Township in Yixing County and four others on August 5, and seized three machine guns and more than 20 rifles. Subsequently, they attacked Jingqiao and disarmed the reactionary armed forces. The Kuomintang militia in Huwen Town (Yixing County), Shiji Township (Guangde County) and part of the joint defense force of Zhangzhu District Office (Yixing County) also staged uprisings one after another and participated in the resistance movement. On August 14, the insurgents encountered and bravely struck the Kuomintang police force at Xianghengling. It is reported that the insurgent soldiers and civilians have the momentum to advance on Changxing.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd—According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, an incident of people resisting officials and police recently occurred in Dinghai County on the Zhoushan Islands outside the Qiantang River. Armed farmers attacked the county seat. On July 24, the county police brigade went to @ Township to collect 15,000 catties of grain, forcing the villagers to hand it over immediately, and severely beat Yu Chenggen, the head of the twelve baojia in the township, almost to death. The people of the township beat gongs and gathered a crowd, tying up more than ten county police officers who were urging the grain and escorting them to the county government. While passing through Tianzhi, the salt police stationed there armed and forcibly released the county police, and a conflict broke out. Bullets flew like rain for a time, and villager Chen Abao was shot and killed on the spot, and Zhou Peizai was seriously injured in his right arm. The villagers were filled with grief and indignation, fought back and repelled the salt police, and attacked the salt affairs office, setting fire to all official documents and private property in the office. Seeing the situation was not good, the salt police fled into Dinghai City. The villagers swarmed into the city and went straight to the county government, first disarming the guards, and then entering the county government in groups, demanding that the murderers be punished. The joint military and police force suppressed them, and another conflict occurred. Finally, the director of the naval office led a large number of armed forces to suppress the uprising, and it gradually subsided. As a result, it was agreed that local groups would jointly organize an investigation team to be responsible for investigating the incident. In total, one villager died, four were seriously injured, and nine police officers were injured.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st—According to comprehensive reports from the Chengdu Xin Xin News, New China New Newspaper, Tianjin Ta Kung Pao and other newspapers: The momentum of civil uprisings in various counties of Sichuan is increasing. The number of people and guns in the civil uprising team in the Erdaoge area under Wangcang County in northern Sichuan reached 100,000, all of whom were poor people from nearby counties. They built trenches widely in the four borders of the area. In Nanjiang County, east of Wangcang, there are tens of thousands of insurgents with more than ten thousand guns, and poor people from various places are continuously concentrating in the area with straw mats and long spears or short guns hidden on their bodies. "Bandits" also frequently operate in the east of Guangyuan County. The insurgents in Nanjiang and Wangcang also have heavy artillery, and the commanders are mostly military personnel. The organization is extremely strict. Even the Central News Agency had to admit on July 23 that there were several groups of "bandits" in Wangcang and Nanjiang, each with three to five thousand people and guns, and claimed that Zhang and Hu, the two commanders of the 14th and 15th District Security Command, and Yang, the brigade commander of the newly编9旅 (according to the original commander of the 5th Division of the Sichuan Army, Yang Shai Gua), were jointly suppressing them. It is also learned that the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Public Office meeting and the Fourth District Supervision Group also convened an emergency meeting of township chiefs in Wangcang on July 24, and jointly with the relevant persons in charge of the border areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Hubei provinces decided to "suppress" in four routes. However, it is reported that the terrain around Wangcang is treacherous, especially the Wangcang Sandaohe area has an undeveloped forest area 600 miles long and 30 miles wide, making "suppression" extremely difficult. In the Tianquan, Rongjing, and Lushan counties on the border of western Kang, although 200,000 people were massacred by the Kuomintang army this spring, the people's armed forces have now spread like wildfire. The leaders of the armed resistance movement in the area are Chen Ziwu in Lushan, the Zhu Shilong and Zhu Shihui brothers in Rongjing, Li Yuanheng in Tianquan, and the troops of the well-known Huang, with extremely great momentum. The garrison was besieged and suffered many casualties. The Kuomintang authorities are now ordering the 24th Army of the Sichuan Army to step up "suppression." The garrisons and security teams in more than 50 counties in Sichuan have now implemented joint defense. The chairman of Xikang Province has recently ordered the garrisons in the province to increase defense on the border. Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces will also hold a joint defense meeting, and each province will increase the number of regular troops stationed on the border to prevent the spread of civil unrest.
