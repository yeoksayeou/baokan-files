　　【This newspaper's dispatch from Handan, 13th】 A grand rally to support the formation of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army and celebrate the victories of our army's self-defense counterattacks on the front lines was held at the Handan City Sports Square this afternoon at 1:00 PM. In addition to the officers and soldiers of the 38th Army, leading figures from the Border Region's Party, government, and military, the city defense Eighth Route Army, and over 40,000 people from all walks of life in Handan City rushed to participate. Countless lines of people, beating gongs and drums, and carrying慰劳品 (comfort gifts), passed through the archway that read "Strive for Independence, Peace, and Democracy," and poured into the venue from all directions. The masses from the southern district of the city carried tables laden with 慰劳烟酒 (comfort tobacco and alcohol), and they said excitedly: "The formation of the 38th Army and the victories on the front lines are all victories of our 老百姓 (common people)'s patriotic war. Today, we are participating in the rally to sincerely support Commander Kong and offer comfort to the Eighth Route Army soldiers who are protecting our Border Region."

　　Amidst melodious music, Handan City Mayor Wang announced the opening of the meeting, followed by Commander Kong Congzhou and Deputy Commander Liu Weicheng being sworn into office. Reading their oaths in front of the people, the supremely honored Commander Kong raised his right hand and led the reading of the oath:

　　"This army resolutely opposes dictatorship, opposes civil war, opposes betrayal of the country, and vows to serve the people with utmost sincerity, wholeheartedly striving to realize an independent, peaceful, democratic, free, unified, prosperous, and strong New China to the very end. We solemnly swear."

　　After reading the oath通电 (circular telegram) of assuming office, representatives of the people of Handan presented a flag to Commander Kong and Commander Liu. Gongs and drums resonated throughout the venue, with over 40,000 fists raised in the air, and over 40,000 voices shouting the same slogan: "Celebrate the Formation of the 38th Army, Support Commanders Kong and Liu!"

　　Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng Sent Enthusiastic Congratulatory Telegrams
　　Carry Forward the Spirit of the Northwest Army Serving the People
　　Crush the Kuomintang Reactionaries' Civil War Offensive

　　The congratulatory telegram from Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Teng Daiyuan, Bo Yibo, Zhang Jichun, Wang Hongkun, Wang Xinting, and other comrades of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region reads:

　　To General Kong Congzhou, Commander of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army, and All Officers and Soldiers: At the time of our Liberated Area's great victory in the self-defense counterattack war, we are delighted to hear of the formation of your esteemed army in Handan. All officers and soldiers of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu are elated and inspired by the news. The soldiers on the front lines are even more motivated. We hope that you will carry forward the traditional spirit of the Northwest Army serving the people, stand together with people throughout the country striving for independence, peace, and democracy, thoroughly smash the Kuomintang reactionaries' traitorous civil war criminal acts, and that victory will be ours.

　　Amidst two bursts of thunderous applause from the audience, Commander Kong excitedly walked to the loudspeaker. He first expressed his heartfelt respect to the people of the Liberated Area, the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and all the leaders who helped establish the 38th Army. Then, after severely condemning Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of dictatorship and civil war, Commander Kong detailed the 38th Army's uprising against the civil war, saying: "This Northwest people's armed force, from the first year of the Republic of China to the present, for more than 30 years, has always remembered that it is a revolutionary armed force, vowing to fight for the revolution to the very end. This has been the case in the past, and it will be the case in the future. As everyone knows, during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, this army was always on the front lines of the anti-Japanese struggle, suffering serious sacrifices, but never receiving the slightest replenishment. Chiang Kai-shek was bent on eliminating dissidents, attempting to eliminate the miscellaneous troops in one fell swoop during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the anti-Communist civil war. Therefore, in July of last year, there was the anti-civil war uprising of the 17th Division of this army in Luoning. In May of this year, there was the uprising of the 55th Division in Gongxian, and last month, the 177th Division also revolted in Huixian, northern Henan. Now the 38th Army has successively arrived in the Liberated Area. Under the encouragement of the entire Liberated Area's army and people, and at the initiative of all officers and soldiers, the Northwest Army's 38th Army has been re-established in the Liberated Area. Finally, Commander Kong firmly stated: From now on, this army will unite with the Eighth Route Army to fight for the protection of the people's interests."

　　Chairman Yang Called: Practice Economy, Strengthen Unity, Cherish the Army, and Spread the People's Enthusiasm for Supporting the 38th Army Throughout the Country!

　　Chairman Yang's speech was repeatedly drowned out by applause. He said: "This year's Mid-Autumn Festival, the entire region is abuzz with celebration. What does this signify? First, it celebrates the great self-defense victories of the Longhai and Tongpu lines. It indicates that the Border Region's soldiers and militia are brave and good at fighting, have gained the trust and support of all the people in the Border Region, and demonstrates the close unity between the army and the people. This is a force that the reactionaries cannot defeat. Secondly, this joy also signifies an even greater happy event: that the Northwest Army's 38th Army, rich in revolutionary traditions, is now reunited and united with the Eighth Route Army to strike at the reactionaries' offensive." Chairman Yang then called on everyone to practice economy, work better, unite better, cherish the army better, comfort the army, take care of the families of soldiers, transport goods to the front lines properly, women should make good military shoes, the masses should pay public grain well, and while harvesting in the autumn, they should support the front lines at the same time, ensuring that the army and people have grain to eat this winter and next spring. In this way, we can completely crush the reactionaries' offensive. Finally, Chairman Yang proposed sending a telegram to Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all the soldiers on the front lines expressing the people's feelings of supporting and comforting the army. At the same time, he also called for spreading the people's enthusiasm for supporting the establishment of the 38th Army throughout China, and called on Kuomintang soldiers to cease fire and stop the war.

　　Comrade Bo Yibo Said: We Must Struggle Against the Great Traitor Who Sells Out China, and Strive for Independence, Peace, and Democracy. The 38th Army is One of the Milestones of Our Victory.

　　Amidst continuous applause, Comrade Bo Yibo clearly announced to everyone: At present, we do not have peace. Our task is for the army and the people to continue to mobilize and crush the offensive of the traitors and national scum. He said: "After defeating Japanese imperialism, the War of Resistance was won, but we did not achieve final victory, nor did we achieve peace. After the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions were announced, the people of the Liberated Areas once thought that peace had arrived and that they could live and work in peace and contentment. Everything was prepared for peace. Now the facts have proven that this was a set of scams set up by Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries. We were too naive, we were fooled. During this time, Chiang Kai-shek seized the time to actively prepare for the civil war, and now he has concentrated dozens of divisions to attack our Liberated Areas. Why is there no peace even after the Japanese imperialists were driven away?" Comrade Yibo pointed out: There are two things hindering our peace: one is the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is obsessed with dictatorship and civil war, and the other is American imperialism. The former wants to be a dictator, so it does not allow the people to have democracy and peace. He is a great despot in the whole country. He does not allow the people to have land demands, nor does he allow the people to have demands for survival. He wants to turn China into a colony, and he acts as a son-emperor, so he sells China's territorial waters, airspace, and territorial sovereignty to his master, the United States. The latter is expressing "concern" for China because they want to scrape more oil from the Chinese people. Therefore, we must stand on our own posts and do everything to repel the offensive of the Sino-American reactionaries in order to achieve peace, and we must struggle against this great despot to strive for independence, peace, and democracy. Then, Comrade Yibo pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war can be completely crushed because the Chinese people have had eight years of training and one year of lessons, the lessons of Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mei, as well as the vast Liberated Areas and the powerful Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army, especially today's anti-civil war Democratic Allied Army being established everywhere, is an important force in striving for China's independence, peace, and democracy. The Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army is one of the milestones to victory. Under the joint strikes of many Democratic Allied Armies (and more Democratic Allied Armies in the future) in the Liberated Areas, the civil war plot of the head of the traitor and national scum will surely fail. Finally, Comrade Yibo called on the army to strengthen its support for the government and love for the people, so that the relationship between the army and the people can truly be as united as a harmonious family. This is the basic guarantee of victory.

　　Vice-Chairman Xing Pays Tribute to Commander Kong and Deputy Commander Liu on Behalf of 30 Million People

　　After Vice-Chairman Xing of the Border Region Assembly paid tribute to the uprising Commanders Kong and Liu on behalf of the 30 million people of the Border Region, he expressed his earnest hope that this people's army will become even stronger in the future, that the army and the people will unite together, crush the offensive of the great despot Chiang Kai-shek, and complete the task of the people's army. Then representatives of the people of Handan spoke.

　　Finally, Deputy Commander Liu delivered a reply, saying: From now on, this army will use its utmost determination to be a people's army, to be a people's servant, to oppose civil war, in order to repay the masses for their earnest hope in us.

　　After the meeting, various Yangko teams performed dozens of story programs to their heart's content. In the evening, the Peking University翻身剧团 (Liberation Drama Troupe) organized an evening party, performing活报 (living newspaper) and other programs.

　　邯市四万余人狂欢庆贺
    民主联军三十八军成立
    孔从周刘威诚正副军长宣誓就职
    【本报邯郸十三日电】拥护西北民主联军三十八军成立，庆祝前线我军自卫反击胜利大会，本日下午一时，于邯市体育广场盛大举行。出席者，除三十八军将士外，边区党政军民各首长，城防八路军，以及邯市各界群众四万余人均赶赴参加。数不清的行列敲着锣，打着鼓，扛着慰劳品，通过“为独立和平民主而奋斗”的牌坊，从四面八方，涌入会场。南城区群众，满桌抬着慰劳的烟酒，他们兴奋的说：“三十八军的成立，前线的胜利，都是咱们老百姓爱国战争的胜利。今天咱们参加大会是诚心诚意来拥护孔军长和慰劳保卫咱们边区的子弟兵八路军的。”
    在悠扬的乐声中，邯市王市长宣布开会，孔从周军长刘威诚副军长接着宣誓就职。在人民面前宣读自己的誓言，于是无上光荣的孔军长非常欣慰的高举着右手领导宣读誓词：
    “本军坚决反对独裁，反对内战，反对卖国，誓以至诚，全心全意为人民服务，为实现独立和平民主自由统一富强的新中国而奋斗到底。谨誓。”
    接着宣读就职通电后，邯市人民代表向孔刘军长献旗，全场锣鼓齐鸣，四万多个拳头举在空中，四万多张嘴喊着一个口号：“庆祝三十八军成立，拥护孔刘两军长！”
    刘司令员邓政委等热忱电贺
    发扬西北军为人民服务精神
    粉碎国民党反动派内战进攻
    晋冀鲁豫军区刘伯承、邓小平、滕代远、薄一波、张际春、王宏坤、王新亭等同志的贺电写着：
    西北民主联军三十八军军长孔从周将军暨全体官兵公鉴：值兹我解放区自卫反击战争大捷之时，欣闻贵军在邯郸军次成立，我晋冀鲁豫全体官兵，闻讯莫不欢腾鼓舞，前线将士益形奋发，望你们发扬西北军为人民服务之传统精神，与全国为独立和平民主奋斗之人士，站在一起，彻底粉碎国民党反动派卖国内战之罪恶行为，胜利是我们的。
    在全场两次轰动的掌声中，孔军长兴奋的走到扩音器前，他首先对帮助三十八军成立的解放区人民，共产党、八路军及各位首长，表示衷心的敬意。接着孔军长痛斥蒋介石独裁内战的罪恶之后，即详述三十八军反内战起义经过，他说：“这支西北人民的武装，从民国元年到现在，三十多年来，时时刻刻都记住自己是革命的武装，誓死为革命奋斗到底，过去这样，今后也是这样。谁知在八年抗战中，本军始终在抗日的第一线，遭受着严重的牺牲，然从未获得丝毫补充，乃蒋介石一心排除异己，反企图在抗日战争与反共内战中一举消灭杂牌，故去年七月，有本军十七师在洛宁的反内战起义，今年五月，又有五十五师巩县的起义，以及上月一七七师又在豫北辉县起义。现三十八军已陆续来到解放区，在全解放区军民的鼓励下，全军官兵倡议下，西北军的三十八军又重新在解放区成立起来。最后孔军长坚决表示：今后本军当与八路军并肩团结为保卫人民的利益而奋斗。
    杨主席号召：节衣缩食，团结工作，爱护军队，把群众拥护三十
    八军的热情传到全国去！
    杨主席的讲话，数度为掌声所淹没。他说：“今年中秋节，全区人民，到处沸腾着狂欢这表示着什么？首先是庆祝陇海同蒲伟大的自卫胜利。它表示着边区子弟兵和民兵的英勇善战，已得到边区全体人民的信任、与拥护，表示了军民关系的亲密团结，这是反动派不能战胜的力量。其次这种欢欣还表示了一件更大的喜事：就是富有革命传统的西北军三十八军，现在又重新团结起来，与八路军团结起来，打击反动派的进攻。杨主席继即号召大家要节衣缩食更好的工作，更好的团结，更好的爱护军队，慰劳军队，照顾军人家属，好好往前线运输，妇女要作好军鞋，群众要交好公粮，秋收时要一面收秋，一面支援前线，保证今冬明春军民有粮吃，这样我们是可以完全粉碎反动派的进攻的。最后杨主席提议把群众拥军慰劳的心情，打电报给刘师长，邓政委及前线全体将士，同时还要把群众拥护三十八军成立的热情，传播到全中国去，号召国民党士兵，停战罢战。
    薄一波同志说：我们要斗争出卖中国的大恶霸，为独立、和平、
    民主而奋斗。三十八军就是我们胜利的里程碑之一。
    在连续不断的掌声中，薄一波同志向大家明确宣布：目前我们并没有和平，我们的任务是军民继续动员粉碎汉奸卖国贼的进攻。他说：“打败日本帝国主义之后，抗战是胜利了，但我们没有得到最后胜利，也没有得到和平，政协决议公布后，解放区人民曾一时以为和平已经到来，可以安居乐业过日子了，一切都准备着和平，现在事实证明了是蒋介石和美国反动派所设的一套骗局，我们太天真，我们上当了，在这一时蒋介石取得时间积极准备内战，现在并已集中几十个师的兵力，向我解放区进攻。为什么打走了日本帝国主义还没有和平？一波同志指出：有两个东西阻碍着我们的和平：一是醉心独裁内战的蒋介石集团，一是美帝国主义，前者想独裁，就不许人民有民主和平，他是全国的一个大恶霸，他不许人民有土地要求，不让人民有活命的要求，他要把中国弄成殖民地，他当儿皇帝，所以他出卖中国的领海、领空、领土主权给他的主子美国。后者所以对中国表示“关怀”，因为他们在中国人民身上多刮一些油水去，因此我们必须站在自己的岗位上，一切为着打退中美反动派的进攻，才能取得和平，要斗争这个大恶霸，为实现独立和平民主而奋斗。接着一波同志指出：蒋介石的卖国内战是完全可以粉碎的，因为中国人民有了八年的锻炼，还有一年的教训，蒋先生和美先生的教训，还有广大的解放区与强大的八路军与新四军，特别是今天反内战的民主联军到处成立，是争取中国独立和平民主的重要力量，西北民主联军三十八军是到胜利的里程碑之一，在解放区许多民主联军（将来更多的民主联军）的联合打击下，汉奸卖国贼头子的内战企图一定会失败的。最后一波同志号召军队要加强拥政爱民，使军民关系真正做到团结得像和睦的大家庭一样，这是胜利的基本保障。
    邢副议长代三千万人民向孔刘正副军长致敬
    边区参议会邢副议长，代表边区三千万人民向起义的孔刘军长致敬后，即热望这支人民的军队，今后更加壮大起来，军民结合在一起，粉碎大恶霸蒋介石的进攻，完成人民军队的任务。接着有邯市人民代表讲话。
    最后刘副军长致答词，他说：今后本军要以最大决心，作人民军队，作人民勤务员，反对内战，以报答群众对我们的热望。
    会后各秧歌队尽情的表演了数十种故事节目，晚上由北大翻身剧团组织晚会，演出活报等各种节目。
