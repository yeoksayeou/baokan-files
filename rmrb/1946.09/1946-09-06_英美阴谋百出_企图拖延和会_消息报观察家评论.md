Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: TASS, Moscow, 1st: An Izvestia diplomatic observer commented: The American and British press continue to create a gloomy atmosphere around the Paris Peace Conference. The commentators' remarks lament the slow progress and "negative results" of the meeting, which is reminiscent of a cat shedding crocodile tears. The observer pointed out that numerous examples from each day of the conference demonstrate that the representatives of the Anglo-American camp are responsible for the slow progress of the meeting. Those who oppose international cooperation and the organization of post-war peace are attempting to complicate the work of the conference by continuously proposing one amendment after another to the draft treaties, trying to bury the basic and decisive principles of the draft treaties in these practically meaningless amendments. Outside the walls of the Luxembourg Palace, the same forces are also attempting to exert pressure in various ways on countries that are unwilling to become blind tools utilized by international reactionaries and are unwilling to follow the Anglo-American bloc. The observer forcefully stated that the methods used by the Anglo-American bloc to create changes favorable to them at the Paris Peace Conference do not conform to the spirit of democracy and international cooperation. The U.S. fleet's cruising in the Mediterranean is being used as a direct demonstration against the Paris Peace Conference, attempting to turn the Paris Peace Conference into a weapon of their policy. The observer quoted Chicago Sun reporter Kendrick as saying that the United States has now established a new "big stick policy" (referring to the policy of armed intervention that the United States previously adopted towards Latin American countries), launching a large-scale offensive aimed at openly opposing Soviet influence everywhere. The observer concluded, "The democratic countries of the world have suffered too much from the 'big stick policy,' and they will hardly be willing to settle for such a policy, even if the big stick changes owners."

　　英美阴谋百出
    企图拖延和会
    消息报观察家评论
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：消息报外交观察家评称：美英报界继续企图在巴黎和会周围创造暗淡的气氛，评论员们的言论哭泣着会议进行的迟缓和“消极结果”，这使人联想到猫哭老鼠式的假慈悲。观察家指出：和会每一天的许多例子，都说明应负会议进展迟缓之责的正是英美阵营的代表们。反对国际合作和战后和平组织的人们，正试图用一切手段对和约草案连续提出一个又一个的修正案，使和会工作更趋复杂化，企图使和约草案的基本决定性的原则淹没在这些简直毫无意义的修正案中。在卢森堡宫墙外，也有同样的势力在企图用各种方法对不愿成为国际反动派利用的盲目工具和不愿跟着英美集团走的国家施行压力。观察家力称：英美集团企图在巴黎和会上造成有利他们的改变，其所用的方法绝不合于民主与国际合作的精神。美国舰队在地中海的游弋，是被利用作为直接反对巴黎和会的示威，试图把巴黎和会转变为他们政策的武器。观察家引芝加哥太阳报访员肯德里克的话说：美国现在已定了新的“大棍子政策”（即过去美国对拉丁美洲各国所采取的武力干涉政策），发动了大规模的攻势，到处公开的以反对苏联的影响为目的。观察家最后称：“全世界的民主国家在‘大棍子政策’中已受到了太多的牺牲，他们决难愿意安于这种政策，即令大棍子换了主人也罢。”
