    Transforming Cadres by Immersing Them in Mass Movements

　　Cixian County had a considerable working foundation in most areas during the land revolution and the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the land reform movement of last winter and this spring, a new group of activists emerged. These people had contributed to the struggle and were supported by the masses; however, some of them became complacent because of their merits and acted like veterans. Their work style was characterized by paternalism, leading to a serious detachment from the masses. In Nanhuangsha, the masses received only four months' worth of grain and twenty yuan per person during the half-year land reform movement, and their morale was very low. The cadres, however, did not see this, believing that the landlords had surrendered. Therefore, resolving the issue of the old cadres' work style became a key to deepening the movement and thoroughly resolving the land problem in Cixian County.

    The fierce struggles in neighboring counties such as Anyang and Wu'an inspired the masses' enthusiasm for obtaining land and achieving complete liberation, and the masses began to act on their own. Individual villages started to take action while the cadres were away for training, some villages bypassed the cadres and started their own struggles, and in other villages, special agents took the opportunity to exploit the masses' dissatisfaction to attack the cadres. The village cadres began to feel isolated but could not find a way forward.

    After studying the above situation, the leadership determined that the correct approach was to use the actual revolutionary power of the masses to transform the work style of the old cadres, so as to enable them to lead a larger and more in-depth mass struggle. The Fourth and Eighth Districts gained some experience in resolving this problem:

    First, the leadership should first understand the ideological concerns of typical cadres, conduct individual talks, and help them clear their minds. It is best to find those who have good class backgrounds and high prestige in past mass movements, and strive to make them aware first. Start with their past achievements and induce them to reflect on themselves, recognize their current poor relationship with the masses and their future prospects. Responsible cadres, or those related to them, should explain that the higher authorities will not hold them accountable for the past, as long as they lead the mass struggle well, the masses will forgive them and continue to support them, and the leadership will trust them even more.

    Second, leading comrades should praise and reward cadres at any time during their self-reflection, creating a conscious ideological self-examination movement. After typical self-reflection and leadership praise, many cadres automatically exposed their mistakes and shortcomings. The Fourth District's entire activists' meeting resolved: "The people have a lot of grievances, let them vent them properly, hold a venting meeting, and let's admit our mistakes to the masses!"

    Third, after the cadres and activists sincerely made self-criticisms and admitted their mistakes, they jointly discussed new targets and content of the struggle with the masses. The results were generally satisfactory in most villages. Within three to five days, a widespread and intense mass struggle was launched throughout the district. Most cadres improved during the movement, and some who were ideologically rigid had to follow the masses and gradually transform during the movement.

    After this review of the village cadres' work style, the district cadres’ obstruction of not letting go and the idea that "there is nothing to fight against" were broken. Everyone's enthusiasm and determination soared to an unprecedented level. In less than five days, the movement in the entire district reached a climax. Even in the most difficult-to-mobilize Laoyayu, Xiwangkan, Huanghe, Hexi, and other villages, where special agents and feudal landlords had the strictest control, anti-corruption, anti-local tyrant, anti-false pawn, and anti-evasion of burdens struggles were launched, with the anti-local tyrant struggle becoming the climax of the movement.

　　磁县通讯
    深入群运中改造干部
    磁县大部地区在土地革命及抗战时期就有相当的工作基础，在去冬今春的翻身运动中，又涌现出一批新的积极分子，这些人在斗争中有过功劳，群众也拥护他们；但是其中一部分人便因此自恃有功，摆老资格。作风上包办代替，形成严重的脱离群众现象；南黄沙群众在半年翻身运动中，每人只得了四月粮食，二十块钱，情绪非常消沉。干部们却看不见，认为地主低头了，因此解决老干部作风问题就成为磁县深入运动，彻底解决土地问题的一个关键。
    安阳、武安等邻近县份的猛烈斗争，鼓舞了群众获得土地彻底翻身的热情，群众自己行动起来了。个别村庄乘干部受训不在家而行动起来，有的村庄群众撇开干部自己斗起来，还有些村庄，特务分子乘机利用群众的不满打击干部。村干部开始感到孤立了，但找不到怎样前进的道路。
    领导上研究了以上的情况，确定的方针是用群众实际革命力量来转变老干部的作风，使之重新领导更大规模更深入的群众斗争。四、八两区解决这个问题，取得了几点经验：
    一、领导上事先了解典型干部的思想顾虑，进行个别谈话，帮他打通思想。最好找阶级成分好，过去在群运中威信高的，争取他们首先觉悟。从他们过去的功绩，诱导他们反省认识自己，现在与群众的恶劣关系与前途。由负责干部，或让和他有关系的人，说明上级不究既往，只要好好领导群众斗争，群众定会原谅并继续拥护自己，领导上也更会信任自己。
    二、领导同志在干部反省中随时表扬奖励，造成一个自觉的思想检查运动。许多干部经过典型反省及领导上的表扬，都自动的揭发了自己的错误和缺点。四区全体积极分子会决议：“老百姓有很多怨气，叫他们好好出出吧，开个放气会，咱们向群众承认错误！”
    三，干部积极分子诚恳地作自我批评，承认错误后，即与群众共同讨论新的斗争对象，斗争内容。一般村庄做的结果很圆满，三五天内全区即普遍展开了群众性的猛烈斗争，大多数干部都在运动中变好了，一部分思想较凝固的，也不得不跟着群众一齐干，在运动中逐渐转变。
    经过这次村干部作风检查后，打破了区干部不放手的阻碍和“没什么可斗”的思想。大家的热情与决心空前高涨。不到五天全区运动即走向高潮，连特务封建地主统治最严最难发动的老鸦峪，西王看、黄河、河西等村也掀起了反贪污、反恶霸、反假典当反逃避负担等斗争，而以反恶霸斗争成为运动的高潮。
