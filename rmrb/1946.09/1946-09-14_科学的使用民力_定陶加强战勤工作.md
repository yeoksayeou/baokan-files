　　Scientific Use of Civilian Labor
    Dingtao Strengthens War Support Work
    [Report from our Heze correspondent] The first group from Dingtao County to go to the front lines numbered over 10,000 people, and Dingtao has now mobilized a third group. When the third mobilization order came down, county-level cadres felt the task was too heavy, and district-level cadres said, "We can't mobilize any more able-bodied young men from the villages now, there's no way to complete the task!" To solve this problem, the leadership personally went to Chenghe, Qiaolou, Caolou, Zhuzhuang, and Caizhuang, five villages in the Fourth District, to conduct investigations. They investigated the total number of young and strong men in each village, the number away on assignments, the number received at the front lines, and how many were left. According to the results of the investigation of the five villages, one-third had gone to the front lines, one-third had returned, and one-third remained at home without moving. This showed that two-thirds of the labor force had not been utilized, confirming that the idea that "there is no way to complete the task" was unfounded. Therefore, they decided to constantly keep one-third at the front, use another third of the labor force to organize the autumn harvest production, and the remaining third could rotate. After this investigation, they understood their strength, and the cadres' morale was unprecedentedly high. Secondly, special attention was paid to the issue of livestock treatment. Chenji District stipulated that a company must bring more than one veterinarian, and the doctor's compensation would be the responsibility of the public.
    Regarding the supply of grain and grass, they also paid close attention here. In addition to establishing county and district supply stations, they also established front-line supply stations along with the stretchers of the departing masses, with one chief and one deputy stationmaster each, and five doctors. Common acute illnesses were treated at the station at any time. Supply and reception sections were also established, with the task of exclusively supplying flour, firewood, grass, and fodder for stretchers, people, and carts going back and forth. At the same time, they hosted sick and wounded soldiers returning from the front lines, guaranteeing them satisfactory food and lodging. On the road from Dingtao to the front lines, a water station was specially set up every five miles, so people coming and going could drink water, rest, or eat at the water station at any time if they were thirsty. Because the above problems were well resolved, not a single person ran away on the way to the front lines during the third mobilization.

　　科学的使用民力
    定陶加强战勤工作
    【本报荷泽讯】定陶县第一批上前线的就有一万余人，现在定陶已经动员到第三批。当第三次动员令下来以后，县里干部感觉任务太重，区干部说：“现在各村里已动员不出青壮年了，任务没法完成呀！”为了解决这一个问题，领导上亲到四区程河、桥楼、曹楼、朱庄、蔡庄五个村里作调查，把全村青壮年数、出差数、前线收到数、还余多少作了调查，根据五个村的调查结果，到前线的有三分之一，回来的有三分之一，在家没有动的有三分之一，这样还有三分之二的力量没有运用，证实了“任务没有办法完成”的思想是没有根据的，因此他们决定，经常保持在前方三分之一，再拿三分之一劳力组织秋收生产，另外的三分之一可以轮流换班。经过这次调查后，了解了自己的力量，干部情绪就空前高涨。其次特别注意到的是牲口医治的问题，陈集区规定了一个连里必须带一个以上的兽医，医生的待遇，由公家负责。
    对于粮草供给，这里也很注意，除了建立县区兵站以外，又随出发群众担架建立了前线兵站，有正副站长各一人，有五个医生，一般的急病随时在本站医治，又设立了供给股和招待股，任务是专供给来往的担架、人和车用的面、柴、草、料等。同时，招待从前线下来的病伤员，保证他们有满意的食宿。从定陶往前线去的路上，每隔五里路，专设立一个水站，来往的人渴了，随时就可以到水站上喝水、休息或吃饭。由于以上问题解决的好，到第三次上前线时，中途没有一个跑回家的。
