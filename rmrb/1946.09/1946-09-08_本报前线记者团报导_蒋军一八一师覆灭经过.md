The Demise of Chiang Kai-shek's 181st Division
[Report from our Longhai Front, 31st (Delayed)] Our frontline correspondents reported on the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's 181st Division, led by Mi Wenhe, stating: On August 13th, the 181st Division, under the orders of Chiang Kai-shek and Cao Fulin, launched a full-scale westward attack from Mamuye Station along the railway towards our troops in the Minquan area. They were met with a strong resistance, and the division was cut into several sections. Their divisional headquarters and the 87th Regiment of the 29th Division, which had come to reinforce them, were blocked at Lv Village. Mi Wenhe ordered the destruction of civilian houses, the felling of trees, and the construction of a strong defense network with various pieces of furniture taken from the people. He also relied on his heavy weapons, inexhaustible American ammunition, and American-made aircraft for support. The supervisory teams used American pistols and electric batons to force the soldiers to charge, but seven assaults were repelled by our forces.湯湯湯 Meilong, a soldier from the 6th Company of our × Regiment, repeatedly caught the hand grenades thrown by the Chiang troops and threw them back at the invaders. Platoon leader Li Qiukui, seriously wounded, resolutely refused to leave the front line. When the instructor ordered him to be carried away, he cried, "I haven't completed my mission yet!" The soldiers shouted the slogan: "We will never leave the front line until we defeat the traitors!" Zhang Qingyun, a soldier with three wounds, captured five rifles on his own. On the night of the 21st, amidst heavy rain and wind, at 11:00 PM, Wang Xian＠, the company commander of the 1st Company of × Regiment, received the order for a general attack. He led his troops swiftly through the east and west streets of Lv Village, breaking through the Chiang army's barricades. Amidst lightning and Chiang's machine-gun fire, combat hero Wang Mingduo, wounded in both hands, still gripped his gun and charged forward. Company Commander Wang Xian＠ and several soldiers charged and climbed the village walls several times, seizing the high ground. At this point, machine guns, rifles, grenades, bugle calls, and the sound of thunder mixed into a single roar. The Chiang soldiers were terrified and fled in all directions. Wang Jieting, a groom, captured two prisoners and brought back a rifle on his own. A squad from a certain regiment captured an entire platoon of Chiang soldiers alive. Not a single one of the 300 soldiers in the 1st Battalion of the 541st Regiment of the 181st Division escaped. The divisional headquarters of the 181st Division and its reinforcement troops were completely wiped out, and even Mi Wenhe's beloved white horse was captured. Mi Wenhe – this old subordinate of Shi Yousan who betrayed the country three times, and the executioner who had massacred the people of the southern Hebei and Hebei-Luyu plains for eight years – fled in disarray with only a few followers. The 547th Regiment, blocked at Yangqu, Zhangbaosi, and Wangtang, and the 541st Regiment, blocked at Qiaozhuang Bridge and Liuhang, were also completely eliminated by our forces at the same time. In total, over seven thousand Chiang soldiers suffered senseless deaths in this annihilation battle.

    【本报陇海前线三十一日电】（迟到）前线记者团报导蒋军一八一师米文和部覆灭经过称：八月十三日一八一师承蒋介石曹福林之命，自马牧车站倾全力沿铁路西犯民权地区我军，遭我有力阻击，将该部切为数段，其师部及二九师赶来增援之八七团被阻击于吕庄。米文和命令驻村民房拆毁、树木砍光，配以老百姓各种家具构成强固的工事网，并凭借其重武器、打不完的美国弹药及美制飞机助战，督战队则以美国手枪电光刀逼迫着士兵冲锋，但是七次冲锋均被我击退。我×团六连战士汤美龙，一次次地把蒋军扔过来的手榴弹接住，又拿来回敬进犯者。排长李秋奎挂重彩坚决不下火线，当指导员下命令把他抬走时，他却哭着说：“我还没有完成任务呀！”彩号们提出：“不把卖国贼打退，宁死不下火线！”的口号。负伤三处的战士张青云，一个人还缴获了五支步枪。在狂风暴雨的二十一日夜里十一点钟，×团一连长王先＠接到总攻击令，他就带着队伍迅速地通过吕庄东西街，突破了蒋军的鹿砦。在闪电和蒋军的机关枪火中，战斗英雄王鸣铎两手负伤，却仍紧握着枪向前冲锋，王先＠连长和几个战士数次冲击爬登寨墙，控制住制高点。这时，机步枪、手榴弹、冲锋号和雷雨声响成一片，蒋军被吓得惊魂落魄，四处逃窜，饲养员王结亭一个人捉了两个俘虏并带回一支枪。某团一个班活捉蒋军一个排，一八一师五四一团一营三百人没有一个逃掉，一八一师师部及其增援部队全部覆灭了，连米文和那匹心爱的大白马也被俘虏了。米文和——这个三次投敌的石友三老部下，八年来虐杀冀南、冀鲁豫平原人民的刽子手，仅率随从数人落荒而逃。被阻于杨渠、张宝寺、王堂之五四七团与被阻于乔庄桥、柳行之五四一团，亦于同时悉数被我解决，总计这次歼灭战共有七千余蒋军惨遭无谓牺牲。
