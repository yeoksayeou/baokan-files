　　Government Supports the Masses' Demands and Firmly Backs Them Up
    A New Situation Opens Up in the Anti-Traitor Campaign in Southern Hebei
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Weixian] Under the call of the Southern Hebei District Party Committee to fully support the peasant emancipation movement, various localities have boldly mobilized the masses, rapidly opening up a new situation. Over two thousand four hundred villages and over two hundred forty thousand peasants have been swept into the tide of emancipation. The armies and governments of counties such as Gaotang, Xiajin, Enxian, Gucheng, Handan, Linzhang, Linqing, and Yongzhi, responding to the urgent demands of the local masses, have resolutely supported the masses from top to bottom, armed the masses, and cooperated with local armed forces to launch a campaign to eliminate special agents. The government took the lead in handing over the main traitors and special agents to the masses for public trial, and resolutely suppressed those who were particularly bad. This eliminated the masses' concerns about a change of regime and fear of assassination, rapidly opening up a new situation. The masses in various localities spontaneously united to carry out struggles. In Yongzhi and Linqing, more than five thousand people jointly held a meeting to publicly try and execute the special agents and murderers Qi Shouzhu and Li Weihe, among others, pushing the movement into a deeper stage. In Gucheng's first district, six thousand people from thirty-two villages publicly tried and executed the assassination gang members Feng Qing'en and Xie Yunhui, suppressing the special agents and eliminating the ideological concerns of the peasants. Yongzhi's second district overcame the leadership style of being hesitant and constrained. Fifteen villages jointly overthrew the traitor "Oil Tanker," and this influenced and promoted the movement in the surrounding villages. In Guanxian's eighth district, twelve thousand people from forty-seven villages jointly settled accounts with the major traitors Tang Fujie and Liu Zurong for over three hundred cases of bloodshed and murder. Over fifty indictments were submitted by "honest" peasants from twenty-three villages who had not dared to speak in the past. Zhaojiazhuang in Chengci transformed the village government controlled by landlords and launched a heated struggle. Currently, the peasant emancipation movement is vigorously and deeply progressing throughout the district.
