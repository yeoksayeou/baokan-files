　　Taihang Administrative Office Military Region Issues Order to All Military Personnel and Civilians in the Region:
    Replenish Strength and Defend Ourselves at Any Time
    Handan City All Circles Mobilization Committee Sends Telegram of Respect to the Front Lines
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] The Taihang Administrative Office and Military Region recently issued a joint order, calling on all military personnel and civilians in the region to mobilize urgently to further strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. The order pointed out: Comrades of the troops should carry forward the glorious tradition of the eight-year War of Resistance and the Ping-Han and Shangdang self-defense operations, promote new heroism, annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and use the gaps in the war to improve technology, strengthen management, education, health, and supply work, reduce non-combat personnel, and maintain the fullness of the troops and the supply of materials. Launch a political offensive, calling on officers and soldiers within the Chiang army who are unwilling to engage in civil war to organize uprisings and lay down their weapons. It is particularly pointed out that the war is relatively long-term, and attention must be paid to saving the people's strength. The command organs at all levels must have accurate calculations for the people's strength required for each battle, and avoid the waste of people's strength caused by premature concentration and excessively late dismissal. The people's strength participating in the war in the rear should be concentrated in a planned and timely manner to a certain location and battle, and should not be dispersed and consumed for a long time in guerrilla warfare and unnecessary battles. The militia self-defense forces should be well taken care of, informed of the situation in a timely manner, cared for their lives, distributed certain spoils of victory, and encouraged their enthusiasm. In particular, there must be exemplary political discipline (three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention), actively help the masses, and ensure unity between the army and the people. At the same time, it is necessary to cherish public property (especially the buildings in the newly recovered areas) and practice strict economy to overcome financial difficulties. The order pointed out to comrades in the rear, retired honorary soldiers, and all the people: They should be ready at any time to step onto the front line, join the army and participate in the war at the call of the government, closely cooperate with the army in combat, supply the front line with grain and ammunition on time, transfer the wounded soldiers, care for the wounded and sick, pay attention to preferential treatment and resistance, intensify martial law, expose special agents, consolidate the rear, and use the gaps in the war to step up production, emancipation, and martial arts, and vigorously support the war. The order finally called on all cadres: to seize the short-term gaps, carry out in-depth and comprehensive ideological mobilization, oppose all incorrect ideas, strengthen unity, improve fighting will, and actively prepare to welcome the coming great victory of the patriotic self-defense war.
    [Our Newspaper Handan News] The Handan City All Circles Patriotic Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee recently sent a telegram of respect to the self-defense soldiers at the front, stating: In order to oppose the unreasonable attack on us by the traitorous head of state Chiang Kai-shek, and for the happiness of the people, you bravely went to the self-defense front and won a great victory, which made us extremely excited! The "Handan City All Circles Patriotic Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee" has been formally established. This committee will lead the masses of the city to use all their strength to support the front line. Comfort items are being rushed to the front line. We are here waiting for even greater victory news to come from the front!
