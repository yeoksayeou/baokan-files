[This report from our newspaper in Changzhi on the 12th] The entire Taihang area has launched a passionate Mid-Autumn Festival campaign to comfort the troops. Merchants and residents throughout Changzhi are offering holiday gifts to the soldiers on the front lines, and thousands of letters of慰问 (condolence and encouragement) have been sent. The letters express gratitude to the Eighth Route Army for liberating them and protecting their stable and happy lives. One letter stated: "This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is the happiest in eight years. The abundance of fruits shows the signs of this year's bumper harvest. Cake shops are thriving, and everyone is happy. It is said that during the seven years of Japanese occupation, the bleak situation of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival was beyond description. Even last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, although the Japanese invaders had surrendered, the Yan puppet troops forced every household in the city to close their doors. The streets were muddy with autumn rain, and only the Yan puppet troops escorted the Baojia chiefs to plunder food from the people." The gifts that the people sent to the Eighth Route Army mostly took the form of cash, entrusted to the municipal government to remit to the front lines. The Commercial Federation alone donated over 12,000 yuan, and the normal school students donated over 30,000 yuan and over 500 jin of grain. Cadres throughout the city also donated over 15,000 yuan and many other gifts. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, merchants and residents in cities such as Xingtai, Zuoquan, Xiyang, Heshun, and Wu'an comforted the stationed troops. Citizens in Jiaozuo and other cities also especially慰问ed the soldiers wounded in the self-defense war. In addition to entrusting the government to forward holiday gifts to the Eighth Route Army, farmers' associations in various counties enthusiastically treated military families with preferential care. The masses in Zhaoyu Village, Shexian County, sent military families holiday gifts such as fruits, mooncakes, white flour, cash, and eggs. A young hired worker in the village, Jin Shun, specially requested an advance on his wages from his employer to send gifts to the military families. The military families, in turn, wrote letters to their sons and brothers on the self-defense front lines, encouraging them to fight hard and not to miss home because of the festival.

[This report from our newspaper in Changzhi on the 12th] The Taihang Administrative Office and the Taihang Office of the Standing Committee of the Border Council, representing five million people in the entire area, jointly sent a telegram to the Taihang Military Region and all the soldiers on the self-defense front lines during the Mid-Autumn Festival to express their respects. The original telegram stated: "Commanders Qin and Zhao, and all commanders and fighters on the self-defense front lines: The five million people of Taihang extend our highest respect and sincere greetings to you on the Mid-Autumn Festival. Under your heroic self-defense and counterattacks, Chiang Kai-shek, who launched the treasonous civil war, has been badly battered. Cheers of victory fill the Taihang Mountains. Self-defense warriors: Fight even more bravely! Completely defeat the invaders and strive for the complete victory of the patriotic self-defense war as soon as possible. 'Everything for the victory of the front lines,' we fully support you."
