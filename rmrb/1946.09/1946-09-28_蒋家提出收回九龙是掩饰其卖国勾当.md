　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 18th: (Delayed) Public opinion in Nanjing and Shanghai widely suspects that the Kuomintang's proposal to reclaim Kowloon is not out of patriotism. It is believed that the international background to this move is the contradiction between the ambition of American imperialism to monopolize all of China and the existing power of Great Britain, while the domestic background is to cover up greater political reaction. Recalling that in February, in order to overturn the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang reactionaries also launched a short-lived anti-Soviet movement, it is expected that the official "people's organizations" in various places will stage anti-British movements in the same way. However, because the people have had previous experience, and are suffering from the serious war conscription, grain requisition, political terror, and American oppression, the results of this performance may be limited to sending telegrams. A well-informed observer told reporters today: The Chinese people, of course, demand the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and will wage a persistent struggle for it. However, the main violator of China's territorial sovereignty today is clearly American imperialism. People cannot believe that the Kuomintang government, which allows the American navy to be stationed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, allows American planes to invade China's airspace, allows American weapons to massacre the Chinese people, and allows American goods to destroy the Chinese economy, can protect the interests of the nation. The observer asserted that the loyal servant of the American aggressors can, at best, only transfer Kowloon from British rule to American rule.

　　蒋家提出收回九龙是掩饰其卖国勾当
    【新华社南京十八日电】（迟到）京沪社会舆论，对国民党方面提出收回九龙一事，多怀疑其动机是否出于爱国。相信此举的国际背景，为美帝国主义独占全中国的野心与英国现存势力的矛盾，而国内背景则为掩护更大的政治反动。回忆二月间，国民党反动派为了推翻停战命令与政协决议，亦曾发动昙花一现的反苏运动，预料各地官方的“民众团体”，将照样表演反英运动，但因人民已有前次的经验，且正为严重的内战征兵、征粮，政治恐怖与美国压迫所苦，故该项表演的成绩或将限于发通电。某权威观察家今日对记者说：中国民众当然要求中国领土主权的完整，并将为此进行持久的奋斗，但今日中国领土主权的主要侵犯者，显然是美帝国主义，人们决不能相信让美国海军驻在上海、南京、青岛、秦皇岛，让美国飞机侵犯中国领空，让美国武器屠杀中国人民，让美国商品毁灭中国经济的国民党政府，能保护什么国家民族的利益。该观察家断言：美国侵略者的忠仆，至多也只能将九龙由英国的统治转入美国的统治而已。
