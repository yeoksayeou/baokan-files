Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 30th: "Chiang's troops are fierce, Chiang's troops are hateful, when Chiang's troops arrive, there is no escape. Men are forced into labor during the day, women are raped at night." "Talk about the Central Government, speak of the Central Government, the Central Government brings suffering. Those who can work build blockhouses, the fields lie barren, the geese and ducks are eaten clean, the furniture and livestock are looted." These two folk songs circulate along the Jiaoji Railway and in the towns on both sides occupied by Chiang's troops. After Chiang's troops invaded this area, fifteen private coal mines in Boshan and thirteen private porcelain kilns in Shantou Town were confiscated. All primary and secondary schools in the city were closed, and teachers were brutally arrested and killed. More than 400 women in the suburbs of Jiaoxian County were raped and then abducted into the city. Senior officers of the 54th Army of Chiang's troops in Jimo forced women to accompany them in drinking and revelry. In Boshan, a regimental commander of the 73rd Army of Chiang's troops even ordered women to dance naked, and many women committed suicide out of shame and indignation after being humiliated. Li Chuan-yu, a landlord in Xiaochang Village, Zhangqiu, was torn apart alive by being held by his legs. Xu Donglai, a farmer from Budong Village in the same county, had his ears cut off and then executed. Two village cadres in Boshan were brutally chopped into several pieces with a铡刀 (a type of guillotine). The Independent 10th Division of Chiang's troops in Weixian forced each tael of silver to be exchanged for 1,000 jin of military grain. The 54th Army in Jiaoxian City forced farmers to pay 80 jin of military grain per mu of land. Within two days, 500 young men were seized in Linzi City. After 300 young men were kidnapped from Wenzhuang, Zhangqiu, they were forced to become soldiers, and even the elderly, weak, women, and children were dragged to build fortifications. Now, people are risking their lives to flee into the liberated areas and take up arms to defend themselves. Jin Lianhui, a rickshaw puller, escaped from the northwest corner of Jiaocheng City through a small gate by diving through the moat in the dark. He said, "Now I truly see the sun again. I will use grenades to teach the stubborn brains of the warmongers a lesson."

Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 31st: Since Chiang's troops occupied Nong'an County, northwest of Changchun, at the end of May, the reactionaries have incorporated more than 20 gangs of bandits into the Central Army, and the secret agents of the puppet Manchurian regime have also been heavily appointed. In addition to the Baojia system, the "five-household mutual guarantee system" is implemented to prevent the escape of young men. Since July, the Kuomintang reactionaries have implemented large-scale conscription, with all men aged 18 to 35 being subject to conscription. In Yangjiawa Village near Fulongquan in the county, four of the five men in a middle peasant family were conscripted, leaving only a seriously ill patient. At the same time, exorbitant taxes are extremely heavy. Those with one Qing of land must pay 500 yuan in land tax. Residents of Fulongquan must supply the Kuomintang army and bandits with one jin of pork and white flour per household per day. Chiang's troops on Kaoshanban actually wrote "1,000 yuan" on white paper and forced the people to use it as banknotes. They also openly set up brothels and gambling dens, and all young women in the town were raped. Now a folk song is popular in Nong'an: "Nong'an city, not safe; Fulongquan, the spring is dry; the Kuomintang army is causing chaos, more bastard than the bandits; they want grain and rice, they want white flour; they conscript soldiers, they want money; they rape women; please get out of here quickly, if you don't get out, you will force the people to revolt." But there is another world in Nong'an County, which is the vast countryside controlled by the Democratic Allied Army. Here, the mass movement continues to be vigorously developed, and the militia guerrillas are also increasingly active. In the past two months, more than 860,000 mu of enemy and puppet land in 657 Ban (villages) have been distributed to more than 91,300 working farmers. More than 350 local cadres have been trained and promoted in the work, and peasant associations have been organized in 816 Ban, with more than 54,600 participants. In addition, 312 Ban have established militias, which are issued with guns by the government to defend their victorious achievements.

Our Newspaper, Weixian, 1st: Because the masses in Liaocheng City cannot bear the trampling of the puppet army, nearly 10,000 refugees have flocked to the liberated areas. Upon hearing the news, our democratic government immediately sent people to provide relief and resettle them properly. In the year since the victory of the War of Resistance, they have still been subjected to the devastation and trampling of the puppet army. They work day and night, and 40 to 50 people die every day due to weakness. The traitors unscrupulously demanded food all day long, and the puppet police checked the grain in every household every half month. Many houses were demolished for firewood. In the difficult situation of having no food, no fuel, and no shelter, the masses in the city repeatedly asked to go out of the city to find food, but were rejected by the traitor Wang Ni. Recently, the traitors failed several times to rob grain, so they drove the old, young, women, and children out of the city in order to loot all the grain in the city. At dawn on the 9th, a group of refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled from the city. Our troops around the city immediately boiled water and cooked food to entertain them properly. The government also quickly sent people to provide relief. An old lady in her eighties said with tears in her eyes, "If I had known the Eighth Route Army was so good, I would have come out long ago."

　　蒋军到处暗无天日奸杀劫掠涂炭人民
    胶济线上血泪横流
    【新华社临沂三十日电】“蒋军凶，蒋军恨，蒋军来了没了门，白天男人去当夫，夜晚女人被奸淫”。“说中央，道中央，中央来了苦难当，能干活的修炮楼，庄稼一坡荒，鹅鸭吃个净，家具牛马被抢光。”这两首民谣流传于被蒋军侵占的胶济路沿线及其两侧的城镇。蒋军侵入这一带以后，博山十五家民营煤矿，山头镇十三家民营瓷窑都遭没收。城内所有中小学校一律被封，教员惨遭捕杀。胶县城郊四百余妇女，遭奸淫后复被掳入城内。章邱县良履村被包围后，男子被以刺刀驱入一大院内，全村百余妇女遭蒋军奸污，内一少女横遭十八名蒋军轮奸。即墨蒋军五十四军高级军官，强迫妇女陪伴饮酒取乐。博山蒋军，七十三军一团长竟勒令妇女裸体扭舞，许多妇女被辱后羞愤自杀。章邱小长庄地主李传雨，被扯住两腿活活对劈丧命；该县埠东村农民许东来双耳被割，然后处死。博山两村干部，惨遭铡刀铡成数段。潍县蒋军独立第十师，每两银子强迫军粮一千斤。胶县城五十四军，向农民每亩地迫缴军粮八十斤。临淄城两日内，被抓走壮丁五百名。章邱文庄租三百名壮丁遭绑架后，强迫当兵，连老弱妇孺，也被拉去修筑工事。现人民纷纷冒险逃入解放区，拿起武器自卫。洋车夫金连惠，乘黑夜由胶城西北角小门经护城濠潜水逃至解放区，他说：“如今真重见晴天了，我要用手榴弹来教训好战分子的顽固头脑。”
    农安县的两个世界
    【新华社齐齐哈尔三十一日电】自蒋军于五月底侵占长春西北之农安县后，反动派即收编二十余股土匪为中央军，伪满时之特务亦被加委重用。对于人民，除保甲制以外，并实行“五家连座法”以防止壮丁逃亡。自七月份起，国民党反动派实行大规模抓丁，自十八岁至三十五岁男丁均在被抽之列。该县伏龙泉附近之杨家洼村，一家中农五个男子即被抽走四个，剩下的是一个重病患者。同时苛捐杂税亦极繁重，有一垧地者即须出地税五百元。伏龙泉居民每户每日须供应国民党军和胡匪猪肉白面各一斤。靠山坂蒋军竟以白纸写上“一千元”，强迫人民当作钞票使用。并公开设娼聚赌，镇上青壮女子无不遭其奸污。现农安各地流行着一首歌谣：“农安城，农不安；伏龙泉，泉也干；国民党军队胡捣乱，比胡子（土匪），更操蛋，要粮米，要白面；又抓兵，又要钱；见妇女，要强歼；请你们，快滚蛋，再不滚，逼民变。”但是农安县境还有另一个世界，这就是在民主联军控制中的广大乡村。这里继续轰轰烈烈的开展群众运动，民兵游击队也日益活跃。两月余来，有六百五十七个坂（村子）的敌伪土地八十六万余亩，已分配给九万一千三百余个劳动农民。在工作中培养和提拔地方干部三百五十余人，八百一十六个坂中组织了农会，参加者达五万四千六百余人。还有三百一十二个坂建立了民兵，由政府发给枪支，以保卫其胜利果实。
    聊城城内难民  纷纷逃来我区
    【本报威县一日电】聊城城内群众因不堪伪军蹂躏，近万难民纷纷投向解放区。我民主政府闻讯，立即派人前往救济，并予以妥善安置。他们在抗战胜利后的一年内，仍受着伪军的摧残与蹂躏。昼夜出差作工，每天因体弱无力昏倒致死者四五十人。汉奸们整天不顾死活的强索粮食，伪警察每半月挨家查粮一次，许多。房子都被拆了烧火。城内群众在无吃无烧无住的困难情况下，曾几次要求出城觅食，但均遭汉奸王逆拒绝。近来汉奸几次抢粮未果，为了将城内粮食全部掠去，乃驱迫老幼妇孺出城。九日拂晓，一部难民扶老携幼从城里逃出。我城周部队立即迅速烧水做饭，妥为招待。政府闻讯亦迅速派人前来救济。一个八十多岁的老太太感动得流着泪说：“我知道八路军这样好，我早就出来了。”
