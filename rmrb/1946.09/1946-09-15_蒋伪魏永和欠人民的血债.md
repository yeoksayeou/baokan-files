　　Jiang's Puppet Wei Yonghe Owes the People a Blood Debt
　　Pi Yang
　　Wei Yonghe, this traitor who sought glory by selling out his country and working for the enemy, this executioner who slaughtered the people, in the Yuanshi area, whenever people mention his name, they grit their teeth and hate him to the bone.
　　Wei, the traitor, came from a landlord family in Yuanshi. He was fond of wine and women and even engaged in affairs with a woman together with his father. After the incident, he joined the 13th Detachment of the 4th Column of the Kuomintang, serving successively as the regimental secretary, battalion adjutant, and commander of the 3rd Battalion in the Fourth Regiment. In the Jixi area, he hung up the banner of resisting Japan, but everywhere he robbed, raped, extorted, and blackmailed, committing all kinds of evil. At the time, a folk song circulated in the countryside: "Jixi fights (referring to our Jixi guerrillas at the time), the people's army watches, the 13th Detachment wreaks havoc." In 1940, he accepted the "theory of saving the country through a roundabout course," a secret plan given to him by his master, Chiang Kai-shek. Under the leadership of Xu Shoulou, he surrendered to the enemy in Yuanshi. Supported by the Japanese advisor Tanimura Masa, he served as a puppet liaison captain in 1945. For eight years, he cooperated with the Japanese to conduct countless mopping-up operations, massacring anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. According to incomplete statistics from the January conference of the First Sub-district to denounce traitors: in the past eight years, he killed 2,258 people in Yuanshi alone, burned 10,664 houses, robbed 45,346 pieces of bedding, 182 bolts of cloth, 207,581 *shi* of grain, and 13,811,677 yuan in silver dollars, and cut down 3,100 trees.
　　After the Japanese surrender, the people of Yuanshi unanimously demanded severe punishment for Wei Yonghe, whose crimes deserved more than death, to vent their grievances of the past eight years. Unexpectedly, Wei, the traitor, not only did not bow his head to the people, but was appreciated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, who reorganized his troops into the 7th Regiment of the Independent 11th Column of the Vanguard Army, and appointed Wei as the regimental commander. Wei, the traitor, was overjoyed, wearing the uniform of the "National Army" and continuing to butcher the people.
　　Since last winter, Wei, the traitor, has successively created the Nanzuo massacre, the Tongxia massacre, the Suyang massacre, the Zhao Tong massacre, the Nansu massacre, the Bei○ massacre, and the "July 18th" major massacre in fifteen villages including Nansu Village and Wang Village, among other seven major massacres.
　　The Nanzuo massacre occurred on December 29th last winter. Wei's troops, closely cooperating with the 1457th unit of the Kuomintang's Third Army, attacked Nanzuo, the seat of our Yuanshi democratic government, in three routes. More than 30 people, including Senator Wu Jiheng, Section Chief Zhou Kezhi, teacher Cheng Yongzi, and cadres, the masses, and their families, were brutally murdered. Comrade Cheng Yongzi was tied to an electric pole and remained unyielding until his death. Comrade Cui Zengrui (female), a dispatcher from the county government, was stripped naked by the stubborn puppets and hung on a flagpole. Her breasts were brutally beaten, and the stubborn puppet soldiers applauded and laughed below. Despite being tortured in every possible way, Comrade Cui did not utter a single word and was captured and taken to Shijiazhuang. The wife and two children, thirteen and four years old, of Comrade Su Shuancheng were killed when the enemy could not get information from her. The four-year-old child was stabbed with a bayonet and thrown into the pigsty. More than 30 people were killed, eight cadres and civilians were wounded, more than 20 elementary school students, seven village cadres and militiamen, and more than 100 civilians were captured. Many women in the village were raped. Many women were brutally beaten and gang-raped for struggling, resisting, and scolding. After this shocking massacre occurred, the soldiers and civilians in the Jixi liberated area were filled with rage, gritted their teeth, and rose up, vowing to avenge the dead. However, the *Xingshi Daily* in Shijiazhuang, a newspaper of the Kuomintang, prominently published: "The 7th Regiment Achieves a Great Victory in剿匪" (bandit suppression), a "remarkable achievement"! In the eyes of the fascist bandits who are bloodthirsty, how could they not greatly "praise" such a cut-off-the-苗-and-dig-up-the-roots, a "wonderful program" of annihilation?
　　The Tongxia massacre occurred after the Nanzuo massacre. After the stubborn puppets surrounded the village, they discovered that the common people and militiamen had all hidden in the tunnels. Despite all kinds of intimidation, no one came out. The beasts then lit a raging fire and smoked the tunnel. The militiamen inside the tunnel were brave and calm, preparing to fight the stubborn puppet army when they entered the tunnel. One captain and several militiamen, even after being suffocated to death by the smoke, were still in the posture of firing their guns at the entrance of the tunnel. The people in the tunnel were determined to "die together," and even though they were suffocated by the thick smoke, with tears streaming down their faces and unable to breathe, no one dared to make a sound. A child cried in his mother's arms, but his mother, fearing that the enemy would hear and everyone would suffer, strangled the child to death. An old woman in her seventies did not go into the tunnel and was captured for questioning. She firmly refused to say a single word and was stabbed in the intestines by puppet soldiers. More than ten people were killed in this incident (including five or six militiamen), dozens were captured, and furniture and property were looted. The masses scattered in all directions in the cold winter, spending their first New Year after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in the wilderness, in temples, and in earthen kilns, suffering from hunger and cold. On July 18th this year, Wei, the traitor, with a force of over a thousand soldiers, created a major massacre in fifteen villages including Nansu Village and Wang Village. Seventeen cadres and civilians were killed, forty-three were captured, and 126 livestock were taken away. The old and weak family members of the village chief and the chairman of the farmers' association were brutally murdered. Such massacres as those in Nansu, Beichu, Suyang... were all so horrific that they defy description. In total, from January to the first half of July this year, Wei, the traitor, launched over 200 disturbances in Yuanshi.
　　In addition to military massacres, Wei, the traitor, also had his insidious and vicious methods of killing people, which is also the only magic weapon for the Kuomintang reactionaries to rule the people - the policy of special agents. After the ceasefire order, Wei, the traitor, organized "Returning Home Legions" everywhere to carry out special agent activities. Until now, the plan stationed in Yuanshi: Returning Home Legions from more than a dozen counties, including Yuanshi, Zhao County, Ningjin, Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Longping, Weishan, Baixiang, and Lincheng, use methods like quietly probing sentries, knocking on doors, intimidating, throwing stones, shooting in the dark, and ambushes to disrupt the local order in our border areas, attempting to gradually encroach on them. And they threaten places where the masses are mobilized better. They say to the masses: "You are my property, and I control your life!" The mass leaders who once led the peasants to turn over, members of the farmers' association, militiamen, and their families have all become the targets of the Returning Home Legion's bloody "life calculations." On April 18th, a teacher from Chen Village was assassinated, on the 19th, the village chief of Guo Village was captured, the anti-taxation commissioner of Longzheng was arrested, the self-defense captain was arrested, and the village chief and chairman of the farmers' association of Mochi Village were arrested, the village chief of Xiawang Village was killed, and an activist and his mother were stabbed to death on the river beach. On May 14th, the village chief of Chugu was killed, on May 28th, seven cadres were captured in Donggou... There were too many arrests and killings. In April and May alone, village cadres from fifteen villages were arrested in ten villages, one district cadre and fourteen village cadres were killed. The arrests and killings of the masses were particularly brutal. Eighty people were arrested in Zhao Tong Village in one go, and seventy people were arrested in Duxin Village. A refugee was killed simply because he had eaten relief grain from the democratic government. Accompanied by special agent and military activities, since the ceasefire order, we have been encroached upon twenty-one villages in the fifth district and thirty-two villages east of the road in Yuanshi.
　　Wei, the traitor, frantically looted the people. According to incomplete statistics of losses in 24 villages in one month, a total of 45,400 *jin* of wheat, 58,863 *jin* of millet and miscellaneous grains, 23 large carts and 12 *shi*, and 13,400 *jin* of firewood were looted. In Zhicun Village alone, within three days, 180 *jin* of wheat, 1,000 *jin* of miscellaneous grains, 10,000 *jin* of firewood, 100 *jin* of sesame oil, 50 *jin* of sesame seeds, ten pairs of shoes, nine large carts, and 20 livestock were looted. The looting has been even more rampant since the wheat harvest. On June 15th, in six villages including Zhaobao and Du Village, 180 bags of wheat were looted. In Chugu Village alone, 32 large carts and 160 bags were looted. From June to early July, a total of 350 large carts of wheat, more than 200 livestock, and clothes, cloth, farm tools, and utensils were looted, even the shoes of small-footed women were stuffed into their pockets. The peasants watched helplessly as their clothes and the wheat that was about to reach their mouths were looted by the stubborn puppets, and the result of half a year of hard work was starvation.
　　In Wei Yonghe's account book, these are only a few pages after the Japanese surrender, but from here, we can see how the Kuomintang reactionaries instructed their "underground army" to poison the people. This year, the executive team in Shijiazhuang had agreed to disband Wei's troops and severely punish the culprit, but the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the direction of their policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war, further fueled Wei, the traitor's, ferocity. Yuanshi City and its vicinity, where Wei, the traitor, is entrenched, have become a ghostly world, and the people are looking forward to a righteous hand to rescue them from the abyss of death!
　　August 19th.

　　蒋伪魏永和欠人民的血债
    丕扬
    魏永和，这个卖国求荣为敌作伥的汉奸，屠杀人民的刽子手，在元氏一带，人们一提起他的名字，莫不咬牙切齿恨之入骨。
    魏逆出身于元氏地主之家，好酒色，曾和他父亲伙搞着一个娘们。事变后入国民党四纵队十三支队，先后在第四团任团部书记，营部副官，第三营营长等职，在冀西一带，挂着抗日招牌，到处抢掠、奸淫、勒索、敲诈，无恶不作，当时，乡间曾流传着一首民谣：“冀西打，（指我当时之冀西游击队）民军看，十三支队胡捣乱。”一九四○年，他接受了他主子蒋介石所授与的锦囊妙计“曲线救国论”，在许寿禄的率领下，投降元氏敌人，在元氏敌顾问谷村正的扶持下，于四五年任伪联队长，八年来配合日寇，进行过无数次的扫荡，屠杀抗日军民。仅据一月份，一分区控诉汉奸大会上的不完全统计：八年来，他在元氏就杀死二千二百五十八人，烧房一万零六百六十四间、抢去被服四万五千三百四十六件，布一百八十二匹，粮食二十万七千五百八十一石，大洋一千三百八十一万一千六百七十七元，砍树三千一百棵。
    日寇投降后，元氏人民，对于罪不容诛的魏永和，都异口同声的要求严惩，出出八年来冤气。不料魏逆不但未向人民低头，反为国民党反动派所赏识，将其部属改编为先遣军第七旅独立第十一纵队第七团，并令魏逆当团长，魏逆这一下加管又进禄，当然眉飞色舞，穿上“国军”的外衣，继续向人民开刀。
    自去冬以来，魏逆先后在元氏，一手制造了南佐惨案、铜下惨案、苏阳惨案、赵同惨案、南苏惨案、北○惨案，“七一八”南苏村、王村等十五个村的大惨案等七大惨案。
    南佐惨案发生于去冬十二月二十九日，魏部与国民党三军一四五七部队密切配合，分三路奔袭我元氏民主政府驻地南佐，参议员武吉恒，科长周克之、教员程永子及干部群众抗属等三十余人惨遭杀害，程永子同志被捆在电杆上至死不屈，县府收发崔增瑞同志（女），被顽伪剥光衣服，吊在旗杆子上，毒打乳部，顽伪士兵在下面鼓掌大笑，崔同志虽经百般拷打，未吐一字，被俘到石门。苏拴成同志的老婆和十三岁四岁的两个孩子，追问未果，同遭惨死，四岁幼童用刺刀挑到猪圈里，共杀人三十多名，负伤干部群众八人，捕去高小学生二十余人，村干部民兵七人，群众百余人，全村妇女多被奸淫，有许多妇女因挣扎、反抗、唾骂，都遭毒打后，施以轮奸。这一骇人听闻的惨案发生之后，冀西解放区军民都气的咬牙切齿，振臂奋起，誓为死者复仇，而石门国民党醒世日报上，却以显著的地位刊载着：“第七团剿匪大捷”的“赫赫战果”？！在杀人成性的法西斯匪徒们的眼里，对于这样一个斩尽杀绝，＠苗断根的“精彩节目”怎能不大加“歌颂”呢？
    铜下惨案发生于南佐惨案之后，顽伪包围村子后，发现老百姓和民兵都钻到地洞里，经百般威吓，群众始终没人出来，野兽们于是燃起烈火向洞内薰，民兵在洞内英勇沉着，准备着顽伪军进洞之后，与之撕杀，有一个队长和几个民兵，直至被烟薰死后，还作向洞外打枪的姿势，洞里的人抱定“要死都死在一块”的决心，虽经浓烟薰闷，个个泪涕纵横，喘不过气来，也没人敢叫一声，一个孩子在他母亲怀里，被薰的哭了，他母亲怕敌人听见大家吃亏，活活把孩子掐死了。一个七十多岁的老太婆没有钻洞，被抓住盘问，她坚决不提一字，被伪军用刺刀把肠子挑出来，此次被杀死十余人（内有民兵五六人），捉去数十人，家俱财物抢劫一空，群众在严寒的冬天里，四出逃散，他们在野外，在庙里，在土窑里，忍饥号寒的过了抗战胜利后的第一个新年。今年七月十八日，魏逆竟以千余的兵力，制造了南苏村王村等十五个村的大惨案。打死干部群众十七人，捉去四十三人，拉去牲口一百二十六头。村长和农会主席家里老弱惨遭毒手。他如南苏、北褚、苏阳……等惨案，都是惨绝人寰，难以笔述。总计今年一月至七月上半月，魏逆在元氏出扰，共达二百多次。
    魏逆除以军事大屠杀外，还有他阴险恶毒的杀人办法，也就是国民党反动派统治人民的惟一法宝——特务政策。停战令后，魏逆到处组织“还乡团”，进行特务活动，直到现在驻在元氏的计划：元氏、赵县、宁晋、高邑、赞皇、隆平、维山、柏乡、临城等十几个县的还乡团，他们用摸哨、敲门、恐诈，扔石头、打黑枪，打埋伏种种卑鄙无耻的方法扰乱我边地的地方秩序，企图逐步蚕食。并对我群众发动较好的地方，加以威胁，他们对群众说：“你算我的财产，我算你的命！”曾经领导农民翻身的群众领袖，农会会员，民兵，和他们的家属，都成了还乡团血洗“算命”的对象，四月十八日陈村教员被暗杀，十九日郭庄村长被捉去，龙正抗勤委员被抓，自卫队长被捉，墨池村长农会主席被捉，下王村村长被杀，一个积极分子与其母被刺死在河滩。五月十四日，褚固村长被杀，五月二十八日东沟捕去干部七名，……捕杀的事情太多了，仅四五两月十个村庄被捕村干部十五人，杀死区干部一名，村干部十四人。对群众的捕杀尤其凶惨，赵同村一次被捉八十人，杜薪被捉七十人，有一个难民，因为吃过民主政府的救济粮，亦被杀死。伴随着特务及军事活动，停战令后，已蚕食我元氏五区二十一个村，路东三十二村。
    魏逆对人民疯狂的抢掠，据二十四村一个月的不完全损失统计，共抢麦子四万五千四百斤，小米杂粮五万八千八百六十三斤、二十三大车又十二石，柴火一万三千四百斤。在纸屯一个村，三天内抢去麦子一百八十斤，杂粮一千斤，柴一万斤，香油一百斤，芝麻五十斤，鞋子十双，大车九辆，牲口二十头。麦收以来抢掠更凶，六月十五日在赵堡、杜村等六村，抢麦子一百八十袋，褚固一村被抢三十二大车一百六十袋，六月至七月上旬，共抢麦子三百五十大车，牲口二百多头，衣服布匹农具家伙无所不抢，连小脚女人的鞋子，也都要装到怀里，农民眼巴巴看着自己的衣服和将要到嘴的麦子被顽伪抢光，半年辛苦劳动的结果，落了个挨饿。
    在魏永和的帐簿上，这仅仅是日寇投降后的很少的几页，但从这里可以看到国民党反动派，怎样指使他们的“地下军”荼毒人民，今年执行小组在石门曾经协议了解散魏部严惩祸首，但国民党反动派不但未执行协议，反在卖国独裁内战政策的指使下，更助长了魏逆的凶焰，在魏逆盘踞下的元氏城及其附近已经变成了鬼域世界，人民正盼望着一只正义的手把他们从死渊里拯救出来！
                                          八月十九日。
