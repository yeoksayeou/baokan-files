Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st -- Comprehensive report: Since mid-August, when the United States finally rejected Britain's plan for sole rule over Palestine, Britain has adopted a policy of "letting the United States solve it themselves," because the United States demanded a significant expansion of Jewish power to overthrow British rule in Palestine. On the 10th of this month, the British government convened a Palestine conference in London, inviting representatives from various Middle Eastern Arab countries and the worldwide Jewish organization – the Jewish Agency – to participate. The aim was to persuade representatives of both the Arabs and Jews to agree to Britain's federal plan: to divide Palestine into two "autonomous" states (each consisting of two provinces) under British rule, with Arabs occupying 85 percent of the total area and the Jewish autonomous state occupying 15 percent. However, the London Palestine Conference faced resistance from the United States even before it convened. With American support, the Jewish Agency put forward the same conditions as the United States had proposed in August, namely, refusing to participate in the British-convened Palestine Conference unless a Jewish state was established in Palestine as a prerequisite. When it opened on the 10th at Lancaster House in London, no Jewish representatives were present. Nevertheless, the British government, disregarding the opposition of American expansionists and the resistance of the Jewish Agency, proceeded with the Palestine Conference as originally planned. British Prime Minister Attlee even delivered a speech in person, asking the representatives of the Arab countries present (including representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, as well as Palestinian representatives) to support Britain's plan and asking the representatives to forgive. Britain, in its plan, allowed the Jews to establish an autonomous state with limited powers, and Attlee said: "The British government will do its best to help the Arabs." But on the Palestine issue, "for certain reasons (referring to American expansionist policies), British policy has conflicted with the wishes of the Arabs." As of the 17th, the conference had been going on for eight days. According to Reuters, the conference had made no progress. Although the representatives of the Arab countries were very polite in their attitude, they all opposed Britain's federal plan and also opposed America's "immigration" plan. In summary, it is clear that the differences between Britain and the United States on the Palestine issue have widened, and so far, all Arab countries disagree with the plans of both Britain and the United States. In this situation, according to the United Press, the British government may disregard the differing opinions of the United States, the Jews, and the Arabs, and insist on implementing its federal plan.

　　英美近东分歧更远
    英单独召开巴勒斯坦会议
    【新华社延安二十一日电】综合报导：自上月中旬美国最后拒绝英国单独统治巴勒斯坦的计划后，英国即采取“不管美国自己解决”的方针，因美国要求大大扩张犹太人的势力，以达推翻英国在巴勒斯坦统治的目的。本月十日，英国政府在伦敦召开巴勒斯坦会议，邀请中东各阿拉伯国家和全世界的犹太组织——犹太事务局的代表参加会议，目的系欲说服阿犹双方代表，同意英国的联邦计划——即在英统治下把巴勒斯坦分成阿犹两“自治”邦（每邦包括两省），阿拉伯占全境面积百分之八十五，犹太自治邦占百分之十五。但伦敦巴勒斯坦会议在召开以前，便遭受美国的抵制，在美国支持之下，犹太事务局提出和美国在八月间提出一样的条件，即除非在巴勒斯坦成立犹太国的前提之下，拒绝参加英国召开之巴勒斯坦会议。十日在伦敦兰开斯特大厦开幕时，竟无犹太人的代表参加。然而，英政府不顾美扩张主义分子的反对及犹太事务局的抵制，仍照原定计划举行巴勒斯坦会议。英首相艾德礼并亲临演说，他要求到会的阿拉伯国家代表（包括埃及、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯与阿曼等国巴勒斯坦代表参加）赞成英国的计划，并要求代表们原谅。英国在计划中允许犹太人成立权力有限的自治邦，艾德礼说：“英政府将尽力帮助阿拉伯人。”但在巴勒斯坦问题上，“由于某些理由（按指美国的扩张政策）才使英国政策和阿拉伯人的愿望发生矛盾”。截至十七日止，会议已进行了八天，据路透社报导，会议并无进展，各阿拉伯国家代表态度上虽甚和婉，但均反对英国的联邦计划，也反对美国的“移民”计划。综合所述，可见英美在巴勒斯坦问题上分歧已更远，而各阿拉伯国家截至目前为止，对于英美双方的计划都是不同意的。在这情形下，据合众社估计，英政府可能不顾美国与犹太人及阿伯拉人的不同意见，坚持执行其联邦计划。
