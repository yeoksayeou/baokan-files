Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: London dispatch: Eden, former British Foreign Secretary and current Conservative Party member of parliament, delivered a one-hour speech to a public gathering in Watford on the 23rd, calling for the four powers to restore wartime unity. He began by saying: I do not believe that the deterioration of the international situation poses an immediate risk of war. The four powers should actively work to dispel each other's suspicions. Eden continued: The victorious nations should restore the spirit that once inspired them. If we could put ideological differences aside during the war, why can't we make the same contribution to ensure lasting peace? The two ideologies are not incompatible with peaceful coexistence, provided that neither side insists on its own ideology in the other's territory. He called on the representatives of the Paris Peace Conference to exercise three types of self-restraint, namely, to suppress verbal doubts and ideological interference. After Eden's speech, several British newspapers gave favorable comments. The Yorkshire Post said: Although Eden is not the current Foreign Secretary, his discussion of foreign affairs is recognized as an authority. If the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can reach a permanent agreement, the world's fears will be a thing of the past, and a new era of social revival can begin. The London Times also expressed its approval.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: A commentator from Moscow Radio commented on the 25th on Stalin's reply to the British journalist's letter, saying: "People all over the world will welcome Stalin's statement," and pointed out that the hope for lasting peace is closely related to cooperation between the Soviet Union and other countries. Through the words of their great leader, the Soviet people re-guarantee their support for this peaceful cooperation and will do their utmost to promote its realization. The broadcast then rebuked the "new war" clamor in the United States, saying: "Few countries in the world can compare with the United States in the clamor for a new war. Some American publications are trying to create the impression that war is inevitable and therefore must be prepared for quickly. A few days ago, some congressmen who returned from the Far East even believed that the seeds of World War III had been sown, one of whom quoted a US admiral's remarks in Tokyo as saying: If the current situation continues to develop, the Japanese will wear US military uniforms in the next war."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: According to various reports: After Stalin's reply to the British journalist's letter was published, all parties expressed their welcome. Wallace, who had just resigned from Truman's cabinet, issued a formal statement saying: Stalin's statement brings hope to millions of people around the world who are hungry and thirsty for peace. Stalin's statement made him believe that the recent turmoil (referring to his forced resignation from the cabinet) was constructive. Wallace continued: Differences of opinion caused by various national responsibilities and viewpoints should never stop the practical expression of the inner hope of all the nations and peoples of the world for world peace. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech to his constituents in Yorkshire, central England, on the evening of the 25th: "Prime Minister Stalin's statement on foreign policy, at least, provides a new opportunity that we all welcome for Allied diplomacy. I firmly believe that this opportunity will be seized, and of course, there will undoubtedly be many difficulties, but with patience and goodwill, the difficulties can be overcome." A British Foreign Office spokesman declared on the 24th that the British government had taken note of Stalin's statement with concern and said: "This is being actively reviewed here."

　　艾登发表演说
　　呼吁四强恢复团结
　　斯大林谈话各方咸表欢迎
    【新华社延安二十六日电】伦敦讯：英前外相现保守党议员艾登二十三日在瓦特福向民众大会发表一小时讲演，呼吁四强恢复战时团结。他首称：我并不认为国际局势之恶化使最近有发生战争之危险，四强应积极努力消释彼此之猜疑。艾登继称：战胜国应恢复曾经鼓舞它他的精神，我们于战时既可将思想上之差异置于次要地位，何以不能作同样贡献以保障永久之和平？两种思想并非不能有和平共存之理，双方如不在对方之区域坚持本身之主义即可。他要求巴黎和会中之各国代表作三种自制之道，即对言语疑虑与思想干涉加以抑止。艾氏演说后，英若干报纸均有好评。约克郡邮报称：艾登虽非现任外相，但他的谈论外交事务为人所公认之权威，英美苏三国如能获致永久之协议，则世界之恐惧即成过去，而社会复兴之新时代可以开始。伦敦泰晤士报也表赞成。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科广播电台评论员于二十五日评斯大林答复英记者的信称：“全世界人民将欢迎斯大林之声明”，并指出永久和平之希望与苏联及其他国家间之合作具有密切关系。苏联人民借其伟大领袖之言词，重新提出保证他们拥护此项和平合作，并将竭尽所能促其实现。广播继即斥责美国内“新战争”之叫嚣称：“全世界极少国家内对于新战争之叫嚣无可与美国比拟，美国之若干出版物企图造成一项印象，即战争不可避免，因此必须迅速准备。数日前若干自远东返国之众议员更认为第三次大战之种籽已播下，其中之一引述美海军上将在东京发表之谈话称：目前之局势如继续发展，日人在下次战争中将穿美军之制服。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据各方报道：斯大林答复英记者的信发表后，各方咸表欢迎。甫退出杜鲁门内阁的华莱士发表正式声明称：斯大林的声明给全世界成千百万要求和平如饥如渴的人民带来希望。斯大林的声明促使他相信最近的风波（按指他被迫退出内阁一事而言）是具有建设性的。华氏继称：各种不同的民族责任和观点所引起的意见分歧，决不应停止全世界一切民族人民要求世界和平之内心希望的实际表现。英前外相艾登二十五日晚在其选区英格兰中部约克郡对其选民演说称：“斯大林总理关于外交政策的声明，至少提供了我们大家为同盟国外交所欢迎的一个新机会，我深信这个机会将被抓住，当然无疑会有许多困难，但是由于忍耐与善意，困难是可以克服的”。英外交部发言人二十四日宣称：英政府曾以关切之态度注意斯大林的声明，并称：“此间正热烈检讨。”
