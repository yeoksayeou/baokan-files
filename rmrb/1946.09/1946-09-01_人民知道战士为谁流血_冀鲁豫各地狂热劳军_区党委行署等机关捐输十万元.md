　　【This Dispatch from Heze, 27th】People from all counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are enthusiastically supporting the soldiers and wounded personnel on the Longhai Front, who are defending the border areas. A delegation of 18 people from Cao County, led by Mr. Li Heting, the principal of Cao County Chengnei Elementary School, took 37 large carts filled with goods donated by the masses of Cao and Qibin counties to the front lines to offer their support. Many eggs were inscribed with: "Go to the front, here are eggs. The fighting at the front is for us. Wipe out Chiang's army, and the people will be liberated." When news of victory on the front lines reached Juancheng, the whole city rejoiced and enthusiastically donated supplies. Xia Changmao, a watermelon vendor, gave a thumbs up and said, "The Eighth Route Army loves the country and the people," and immediately donated a lot of money. An old man who fries dough sticks in Nanguan Street took out 50 yuan from his greasy pocket and said, "The Eighth Route Army saved us! Chiang Kai-shek is up to no good again! Not letting us live, thanks to the Eighth Route Army for protecting our peace." The entire faculty and students of the city's teacher training class donated 18,000 yuan in relief funds within two hours. Zhaozi Village in Nanhua County donated 10,055 yuan, more than 20 chickens, in one day. When Chang You's mother heard about supporting the Eighth Route Army, she immediately grabbed a chick and ran to the street to say to the cadres, "Give this chick to the Eighth Route Army to eat! It's important not to let the Kuomintang bastards come here." In addition to soliciting donations for relief, the people in each village in the Pingling District of the county wrote letters of condolences. The letter from Anzhuang read: "Brothers who are shedding blood for the people at the front: You drove away the devils and led us to turn ourselves into masters. Now Chiang Kai-shek wants to drink our blood again. We understand who you are doing this for. We all hope that you will quickly defeat those reactionaries who use American guns to fight the Chinese people." Women throughout Dingtao County worked all night to make shoes to comfort the front-line soldiers. Wounded soldiers returning to the rear often excitedly said, "The people's stretchers are really good, with awnings on top and mattresses below. The people love us so much, we are willing to sacrifice ourselves." The Hebei-Shandong-Henan CCP Regional Committee, the Administrative Office, and the Military Region Headquarters used 100,000 yuan of production income to support the army, and called on other organs, groups, and individuals to actively donate.
