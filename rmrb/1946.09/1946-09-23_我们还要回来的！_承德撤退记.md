　　We Will Be Back!
　　——A Record of the Retreat from Chengde
　　Huashan
　　Chengde, the capital of Rehe, was liberated for one year and nine days, but due to the great and wise requirements of the self-defense war, the people have painfully and temporarily abandoned it again. Giving it up now in order to take it back in the future, this immediate discomfort and the belief in future victory is unforgettable for every citizen of Chengde and difficult for others to experience. In these tense days, the one thought that lingers in people's minds is to make sure that the Chiang Kai-shek invaders get nothing when they enter the city, increasing the difficulty of their unjust war. Railway workers who make a living from the railway drove the locomotives into the mountains, blowing them up in the tunnels, so that even cranes could not move them. Then, they settled their families on the trains and sent them away first, tirelessly destroying bridges and tracks. They organized a capable road demolition team, ensuring that the railway would not be passable until they returned, repairing it by day and tearing it up at night. In the urban area, citizens dismantled the railway sleepers in a single morning, vying to destroy the roads. There were peasants, merchants, and people from other places. The peasants pointed to the railway and said, "You have transported all our grain away all these years. Let 'Second Manchuria' (as the people call the Chiang troops) carry it on their shoulders." People from other places said, "Even if I don't go home for three years, if there is no peace, I will still suffer under 'Second Manchuria.'" Because people were vying to use silver dollars to buy border currency, even gold was sold.
　　On August 12th, 40,000 peasant representatives from Chengde City held a five-day peasant representative conference at the Mourning Palace Liberation Theater. The representatives raised their heads in the Nanmu Hall and said, "The common people are the emperors now. The Communist Party member Gu Dingchang, the local tyrant and traitor, is waiting for Chiang Kai-shek to support him, wanting to seize the land we have liquidated. He thinks too highly of himself. During the 'Manchukuo' days, we didn't dare touch a hair on anyone's head, but we didn't see him spare us a rent. Isn't 'Second Manchuria' the same! He is waiting for Chiang Kai-shek to chop off our heads, and I will overthrow them." They enthusiastically discussed at the meeting how to prepare gunpowder to make landmines, calculated how many local rifles and quick-firing guns there were in the village, and planned to establish a joint village self-defense team. The day after the representative conference closed, representatives led thousands of peasants carrying iron shovels and hoes to the suburbs to destroy the railway.
　　By the 20th, the Chiang troops in Pingquan began to attack Chengde. The evacuation was carried out calmly according to plan. There were no machines in the machine rooms, no goods in the warehouses, and only young and middle-aged people with weapons were left in the agencies. The lights were still on, the market was as lively as ever, the newspapers were still being published, and the radio station was broadcasting the scheduled program "Resolutely Fight the Reactionaries Without Mercy," a song created on the banks of the Luan River, broadcast several times in the evening. The Victory Theater showed "The Self-Defense Force Kills Bandits" for ten consecutive days, with every performance fully booked - Chengde was particularly firm at this time, welcoming the battle in tense and solemn work. On the evening of the 26th, the power plant stopped supplying electricity. A local who had been purged in the mass movement found the last batch of evacuating agencies through the night and said: "I have never seen officials who don't want money. Your Communist Party succeeds and you do it, you fail and you do it, you always do it to the end until you succeed. I took the wrong path in the past, I believe you will still be back, then we will see each other again." A local middle school teacher said painfully to people: "When the Communist Party is in power, I sincerely say that the New Democracy is good. Tomorrow, the Kuomintang will come and force me to say that Fascism is good. If the students ask me which doctrine is good? How should I answer them!?" He finally abandoned his many years of city life and resolutely followed the school. Some female teachers could not make up their minds whether to leave or not on the 25th, but on the evening when the lights went out, they put down their families and chased after the retreating ranks, saying: "We have already taken the wrong path, and we cannot make another mistake!" People who were previously called "Four Dynasties Elders," who had done things in the Manchu Qing, in the Republic of China, and in "Manchukuo," were no longer willing to be "Five Dynasties Elders" under "Second Manchuria." They put their families in carts and advanced through the sweeping of planes, towards the road of the vast countryside. Old women held their grandchildren in the rolling sandstorms, and children played with wooden pistols on enemy vehicles in the scorching sun. A thirteen-year-old student from the First Primary School said to me: "My family is also moving to my grandmother's house in the countryside!" As if he had discovered some secret, he tilted his head and smiled and said: "I know this is your Eighth Route Army's plan. You lose this city and lose that city, dividing the Kuomintang soldiers into small groups here and small groups there, and then you will eliminate them one by one, and then you will take them all back. If I stay in the city and kill the Kuomintang, and I can't see you come back, then I won't do it!" How simple and accurate this childish idea is. Thousands of workers, technicians, students, shop assistants, and former staff members from Chengde City took their books and tools and went to the unfamiliar countryside. On the 28th, the war approached the suburbs from several directions. Fighting broke out at the railway station, and fighting broke out on Bangchui Mountain across the river from the Imperial Palace. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the self-defense teams and district squads of the peasants in the suburbs, these armed peasants who had just obtained land, unhesitatingly abandoned their crops and land and followed the fighting troops, moving to the outer lines, "Follow the Communist Party and return with the Communist Party!" A veteran of the field army who had resolutely fought for eight years touched the scars on his body and said to me: "We eat our fill and do our work. Although we have made contributions in the war against Japan, we cannot guarantee peace. We are always sorry for the people, but I believe we will definitely be back!" Chengde has such people and such an army, and in the end, it will be done. People will not forget August 28th, because this is the day the battle began.

　　我们还要回来的！
    ——承德撤退记
    华山
    热河首府承德解放了一年零九天，但由于自卫战争远大明智的要求，人民又忍痛暂时将它放弃了。为了将来拿回它而现在放弃它，这种眼前的难受和对未来胜利的信念，是每个承德市民所无法忘怀的，也是别人所难以体验的，在这些紧张的日子里，人们时刻所萦绕着的一个念头，即是尽可能使蒋介石侵略者进入城来一无所获，增加它不义作战的困难。靠着铁路养家的机工，把火车头开进山洞，炸倒在隧道里，让起重机也无法把它搬走，随后把家属安置到车上，打发他们先走了，没日没夜的破坏着桥梁路轨。组织成精干的破路队，咱们什么时候不回来，那它就什么时候都不能通车，他白天修起，咱晚上把它掀掉。市区的铁路枕木一个上午叫市民拆光了，抢着破路的有农民、商人、外乡人，农民指着铁路说：“这些年咱们粮食尽叫你搬光了。‘二满洲’（人民这样称呼蒋军）来叫他自己用肩膀扛。”外乡人说：“拚上三年不回家，和平不了回家一样要受‘二满州’的气”。
    就在铁路工人连续三天破坏车站八孔大铁桥，武烈河畔民兵成天演习地雷轰声震天塌地的时候，米价却由三千八落到三千六一斗，老百姓把边币留起，以便万一弃守以后，可以返回乡下买到粮食，他们坚信承德被占以后，也会和平泉、凌源、朝阳一样给他们粮食，不是美国卡车或支离破碎的铁路线，而是离城不远的解放区农村。商人拿着边币说：“承德暂时丢了，我到张家口或边区别的地方去，有了边币，到处可以赚钱，国民党‘二满洲’一来，买卖不好做，光‘二日本’美国货就把咱们买卖人淹死了。”由于人民争着用银洋买边币，连金子都脱手了。
    八月十二日承市四万农民的代表，在谋宫解放剧场，开了五天农民代表大会，代表们在楠木殿上昂着头说：“老百姓当了皇上，共产党员古鼎昌，恶霸汉奸盼老蒋给他撑墙柱，要抢走咱们清算回来的土地，想得好，‘满洲国’那阵子，咱没敢动谁一根毛，也没见他饶过咱一把租子，‘二满洲’来了还不是一＠样！他盼老蒋来拔脑袋，我也把他们翻了。”他们在会上津津有味的商量怎样配火药造地雷，算计村里有几支土枪，几支快枪，合算成立联村自卫队，代表会闭幕第二天，就有代表领上成千的农民扛着铁锹锄头到市郊破铁路去了。
    到了二十号，平泉蒋军开始进攻承德。疏散在沉着的按着计划进行，机器房里没有机器，货栈里没有货物，各机关留下的都是拿着武器的青壮年，电灯照常亮着，市场热闹如故，报纸照常发行，广播电台播着的放送预定的节目《反动派坚决打他不留情》这是在滦河边创作的歌曲，在晚上放送几遍，胜利剧场连演十天的《自卫队杀贼》，场场满座，——承德这时分外显得刚毅，在紧张肃穆的工作中迎接战斗。二十六日晚上，发电厂停止送电，一个曾在群众运动中被清算的当地人，穿过黑夜找到最后一批撤退的机关说：“我从来没有见过不要钱的官，你们共产党胜利也干，失败也干，一天不成功你们总是干到底，我过去走错了路，相信你们还是要回来的，那时候我们再剖心相见。”一个当地的中学教员沉痛地对人说：“共产党在时我衷心说新民主主义好，明天国民党来了要强迫我说法西斯主义好，要是学生问我到底那个主义好？要我怎样回答他们呢！？”他终于抛弃多年城市生活，毅然随学校走了，好些女教员在二十五日还下不了走不走的决心，可是电灯熄灭的晚上，却放下家庭追上撤离的行列说：“我们已经走错了路，再不能一错再错了！”以前被称为“四朝元老”，在满清，在民国，在“满洲国”都做过事情的人，再不愿在“二满洲”做个“五朝元老”，他们把家庭搁置在大车里，冒着飞机的扫射前进，走向广大农村的道路，老太婆在滚滚风沙中抱着孙儿，小孩顶着烈日在敌车上玩着木质的手枪，第一完小一个十三岁的学生对我说：“我家也要搬到乡下姥姥家去！”像发现了什么机密似的，他歪着脑袋笑着说：“我知道这是你们八路军的计，你们丢这个城，丢那个城，把国民党的兵分成这里一小团团，那里一小团团，然后一个个把他消灭，就都收回来了，我留在城里把国民党打死了，看不见你们回来，那我不干！”这个稚气的想法，多么朴素而准确，几千多个承德市的工人、技师、学生、店员、旧职员带上自己的书籍工具一起走向生疏的农村。廿八日战争从好几方面逼近市郊，火车站打响了，离宫隔河的棒棰山打响了，下午三点钟市郊农民的自卫队，区小队，这些才得到土地的武装的农民，毫不犹疑的丢下庄稼和土地，跟随战斗部队，移到外线，“跟共产党走跟共产党回！”坚决转战了八年的野战纵队老战士，摸着身上几处伤痕对我说道：“咱们吃饭吃饱，做事做了，虽说抗日有功，保不住和平，总是对不起老百姓，但我相信我们一定还要回来的！”承德有着这样的人民和这样的军队，最后终是要做到的，人们不会忘记八月二十八日这一天，因为这是战斗开始的日子。
