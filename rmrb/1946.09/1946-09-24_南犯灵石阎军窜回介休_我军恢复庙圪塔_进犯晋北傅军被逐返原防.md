Xinhua News Agency, Yangcheng, 20th: Yan Xishan's troops under Sun Chu, consisting of five regiments, invaded Miaogeta on the 13th from Jiexiu southward to Lingshi. They continued to advance towards the Zhanduan direction and briefly occupied the area on the 15th. However, under continuous attacks by our local armed forces and militia, the invading troops finally retreated in panic at midnight. Our army seized the opportunity to recover Miaogeta, and Yan's troops fled back to Jiexiu in disarray. More than 70 wounded soldiers abandoned by Yan's troops on the battlefield were mixed with corpses everywhere, groaning in pain and cursing Yan Xishan, saying, "You enjoy the blessings, but you send us to die?!"

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 21st: Fu Zuoyi's troops, who had sneaked into northern Shanxi in two directions to attack Pianguan and Hecheng, suffered heavy losses due to the joint attacks of local armed forces and militia and have fled back to their original defenses. Both cities and their affiliated areas are in the hands of the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army. More than 800 of Fu's troops under Zhu Wumei, entrenched on the west bank of the Yellow River, successively invaded Luoquan Fort (northeast of Hecheng) and Sijian Town (30 miles southeast of Hecheng) on the 14th, and once briefly occupied Hecheng. On the 16th, the guerrillas launched a vigorous attack on the Fu troops in Luoquan Fort, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 300 of Fu's troops. After suffering this heavy blow, the Fu troops who had launched the attack retreated to the west bank of the river in panic on the night of the 17th. In addition, more than 400 soldiers of Fu's troops under Guo Changqing, stationed in Qingshuihe, sneaked into Pianguan County on the evening of the 12th, and after being attacked by local troops and militia, they collapsed and returned to their original locations in separate routes on the 14th. During this invasion of the Hecheng and Pianguan areas, Fu's troops burned, killed, and looted along the way, killing as many as 20 people. Local residents are actively reorganizing militia organizations and are determined to take revenge.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 21st: Chiang's military officers and soldiers in the border areas of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area are constantly withdrawing from the civil war. On the 4th, when Liu Huanan's troops of the Baoding Chiang army invaded Rantou and Ligongzhuang, a squad of soldiers from the invading troops immediately staged an uprising on the battlefield and cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to counterattack the invaders. In addition, Tao Yannian, a soldier of the 2nd Tank Regiment of Chiang's army, a high school graduate from Zhucheng, Shandong, has also defected to the Liberated Area. Feng Lu, the instructor of the special service company of Chiang-Yan's army stationed in Huangjiusha, Shouyang, recently led ten soldiers, carrying full arms, to surrender.
