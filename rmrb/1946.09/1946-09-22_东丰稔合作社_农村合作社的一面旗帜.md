　　Dong Fengren Cooperative
    A Banner for Rural Cooperatives
    Zhang Yu
    I. Dong Fengren Village Transforms from Poverty to Prosperity
    The model cooperative in Xiyang, the Dong Fengren Village Cooperative, has not only become the economic center of the village's 134 households and 538 people, winning the support of all the villagers, but has also gained the belief of the masses in nearby villages, becoming a banner for rural cooperative undertakings in Xiyang. Under the efforts of Comrade Zhang Zhenhua, the director, and all the staff, the cooperative now possesses assets including: 240,000 yuan in cash, over 120 shi of stored grain, dozens of shi of hemp seeds, 16 mu of land, over 100 sheep, 18 pigs, 3 donkeys, a textile factory with 20 looms and 60 spinning wheels, a woodworking factory, and a sizable oil mill; there is also a nursery. In the spring of 1943, when the cooperative was first established, its total capital was equivalent to only seven shi of corn. The organization leading the comprehensive agricultural and sideline production of Dong Fengren is called the "Labor Cooperative," which is divided into agricultural and sideline departments, with the sideline department being the cooperative, and Zhang Zhenhua concurrently serving as the head of the sideline department.
    In 1943, Dong Fengren was located in a guerrilla area where the struggle between the enemy and ourselves was fierce, and the people were scattered in the mountain valleys, making it extremely difficult to purchase daily necessities. The cooperative was established with more than 800 yuan in share capital and more than 1,400 yuan in government loans, with the aim of supplying the masses with necessities, smashing the enemy and puppet regime's plot to deceive the people into "maintaining" them with cloth and salt, making the village a fortress that persisted in the border area struggle and never "maintained" the enemy and puppet regime. However, shortly after its establishment, it encountered a severe drought that year, so the cooperative immediately added the goal of helping all the villagers to produce and overcome the famine. In the winter of that year, an oil mill was also opened. The earned oil cake was sold cheaply to the masses to relieve hunger, and 40 shi of grain was purchased from the enemy-occupied area to make cheap adjustments, enabling the village to safely overcome the famine. The savings on the price of oil cake alone amounted to more than 13,000 yuan for the masses, and more than 7,000 yuan in dividends were distributed to the members that year.
    In 1944, in response to the government's call to launch a large-scale production campaign, the people of Dong Fengren returned to the village to live, and the cooperative's business policy shifted to "agriculture as the mainstay, commerce as the auxiliary." Zhang Zhenhua and all the cooperative cadres reclaimed 116 mu of wasteland that the masses were unable to reclaim, bought mules, and hired long-term workers to operate the farm. In order to guarantee the success of the masses' large-scale production, daily necessities were supplied to the masses on credit. Although investment in agriculture led to slow capital turnover, and losses were incurred due to the impact of the autumn grain price drop on credit purchases and sales, huge profits were still made in agricultural production, winter transportation, and oil mill production. A share capital of one sheng of corn could yield a dividend of six sheng.
    Last winter and this spring's winter production was the key to the great development of the Dong Fengren Cooperative, and also transformed the entire village from poverty to prosperity. The cooperative organized the entire village's winter large-scale production. However, in order to organize all the labor force to participate in transportation, many poor households were worried that they could not afford to change their clothes for the season and could not go out because the price of grain was low and the price of cloth was high at that time. The cooperative then put forward the slogan: "Guarantee that the masses will not buy a single grain of food and everyone will wear cotton clothes," bought back more than 8,000 pieces of old clothes and more than 40 bolts of cloth from Xingtai and gave them to them on credit, and specially made oil barrels and gave them oil on credit so that the masses could transport them to western Hebei to earn money. They were also allowed to sell oil, buy foot goods back to sell, and then pay back the oil money. In this way, the entire village's labor force was put into this no-cost transportation and sales business, making every family rich in one winter, everyone wearing new cotton clothes, and paying off all the accumulated burdens and loans of the village for many years, totaling more than 82,600 yuan. The entire village bought 16 heads of livestock, saved half a year's worth of salt, and every family prepared New Year's goods, allowing the poor and dilapidated Dong Fengren to spend a victorious New Year happily. The old, weak, and women of the entire village also engaged in production and earned money through the cooperative's organization. The old men paid for hemp seeds from the cooperative to sell to the cooperative's oil mill, earning one or two yuan per catty. Children ground flour for the cooperative, and women borrowed flowers for spinning and weaving, and established a textile factory for them.
    This year, in addition to continuing winter production and developing sideline industries, we have also made great efforts to help agricultural production, increasing loans to the masses to purchase 11 more livestock, and lending grain to help a small number of families with the shortage of grain before the new harvest. The cooperative's oil mill also exchanged more than 3,000 catties of oil cake at a low price of one catty of coal for one catty of oil cake, which not only increased fertilizer for the entire village, but also saved more than 1,500 fertilizer transportation workers. In short, the cooperative's business has grown from small to large, and the entire village of Dong Fengren has also transformed from poverty to prosperity. Two newly arrived households have also been loaned money by the cooperative to help them buy land and settle down.
    II. It Struggled Out of Difficulties
    The development of a cause is not always smooth sailing, and the Dong Fengren Cooperative has also experienced two crises that almost led to its collapse.
    The first time was in 1944 when agricultural production was carried out. The cooperative had no experience. Not only was the profit turnover of agriculture slow, but 92 percent of the entire capital was used to buy mules and hire long-term workers, which led to slow capital turnover. At that time, even food was not available, so the director Zhang Zhenhua had to invite the long-term workers back to his home for meals. The second time was in the autumn of this year when accounts were collected and foreign debts were repaid. In this year, in order to guarantee the production movement and take care of the difficulties of the masses, necessities were supplied on credit, but the goods were bought on credit. When foreign debts were repaid in the autumn, the price of grain fell sharply. When the cooperative collected accounts from the masses, it had to take care of the masses and convert the price at 40 yuan per catty of rice, while the cooperative could only repay foreign debts at the market price of 25 yuan per catty. The cooperative's capital was also grain, and selling grain to repay debts almost led to bankruptcy. At that time, creditors came to the door every day to demand payment, condemning and making things difficult, and the masses also reflected: "If you don't get involved, you will lose even your capital."
    However, Comrade Zhang Zhenhua did not lose heart. He worked hard and supported it through these two difficulties. 1. Adhere to the correct policy of combining agriculture and handicraft industry, and after autumn, focus on operating oil mills and transportation. 2. The cadres of the cooperative carried forward the spirit of hard work, personally went to the oil mill to squeeze oil one trough a day, and personally drove livestock back and forth for transportation and sales. After working hard for four or five months, the losses were finally recovered, and there was a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan, which enabled the cooperative to develop further.
    III. Mass Line and Calculation Style
    All the business policies of the Dong Fengren Cooperative come from the needs of the masses and serve the masses. Similarly, all its specific practices, every detail, are all for the interests of the masses, following the mass line, which is also permeated by a precise calculation style of wholeheartedly serving the masses. Comrade Zhang Zhenhua understands that "everything will be finished if you are separated from the masses," and "the interests of the masses are the interests of the cooperative." Let's talk about a few more facts: (1) Dividends: The first dividend in 1943, at that time, many poor members only signed up for shares but had not yet paid for them. Should such members be given dividends? There was a dispute within the community. As a result, Zhang Zhenhua's proposal was adopted: "Yes," the reason being: the government loan was given according to shares, although they had not paid for the shares, they had one share of loan, and they were not deliberately failing to pay because they were poor, and they should be supported by dividends to help them buy shares. After a debate on this issue in the village's people's school, it was decided to distribute half of the dividend that should be distributed per share to them. (2) The business principle is to do everything according to the needs of the masses. The cooperative is not afraid of trouble. The masses can not only buy on credit, but also exchange anything, a handful of rice, an ear of corn, an egg, etc., for things of equal value from the cooperative, or exchange them for money. Although the Dong Fengren Cooperative does not handle credit business, it is common to make loans to the masses. Therefore, the masses discuss things with the cooperative, and the cooperative also discusses things with the masses. The cooperative has become the daily meeting center for men, women, old and young in the village. Even the nearby villages are willing to go to the Dong Fengren Cooperative to buy things. (3) Foreign debt issues: Although Dong Fengren encountered a crisis due to foreign debt issues, even though the cooperative urgently needed to repay foreign debts, it also allowed the masses who really could not afford to continue to be in arrears. Although there are elements of affection and grace in this, after a review, they did not cancel the sale on credit, but further realized that in order to enable farmers to obtain the goods or currency they need at any time, so that they are not forced to buy necessities at high prices or sell their own products at low prices, they should sell on credit or lend money to them, as long as the masses are organized to produce and become rich, foreign debts are easy to collect. (4) Precise calculation, such as organizing large-scale winter production last winter, was calculated with the goal of changing the season (cotton clothes) for more than 400 basic people in the village and repaying the burdens and loans owed over the years. After 20 days of transportation, more than 80,000 yuan was earned, and the plan was expanded to purchase 16 more livestock, and specific organization was carried out, and finally completed. For example, many farmers suffered losses in oil transportation because they did not know how to weigh and did not understand the market, so the cooperative reorganized and led them. For example, in the middle of coal transportation, it used to be transported directly from the coal kiln to Xingtai, but it was calculated that it would save time to transport it to the village first and then to Xingtai.
    The success of the Dong Fengren Cooperative is the combination of the mass line and calculation. Since its establishment, the masses have gained great benefits, and dividends have been distributed five or six times. "Frequent dividends" is one of its principles. It understands that more dividends can easily expand shares. The more the masses benefit, the stronger the cooperative will be, so the cooperative has achieved rapid development.
    IV. The "Kiln Bottom Family" Supported by the Entire Village
    "Kiln Bottom Family" is Comrade Zhang Zhenhua. When the masses of Dong Fengren mention these three words, they have a feeling of infinite intimacy. The Dong Fengren Cooperative is inseparable from him. He sacrifices himself for others and serves the masses wholeheartedly. He has no remuneration except for meals. When the cooperative was most difficult, he went home for meals, and hired people to cultivate the land in his own home. He had no complaints. It was not until the cooperative developed last year that it was stipulated that there would be two bolts of cloth throughout the year. He has a democratic style and is very united with other cadres in the village. He always discusses cooperative affairs with the cadres, and they actively help with the work in the village. He is humble and not discouraged when the cooperative is in difficulty, nor is he proud when it is successful. He often says: "Good leadership and good conditions for the masses are the basic conditions for running our cooperative well."
    The masses of the village reflected: Without the "Kiln Bottom Family," the cooperative would have been finished long ago. Comrade Zhang Zhenhua has been conscientious, hardworking, and dedicated to the cooperative cause of the masses for many years, making today's Dong Fengren Cooperative a banner in the rural cooperative cause, but he is not complacent. He said: He will continue to work hard in the future to develop the cooperative's policy. 1. We must develop women's spinning and weaving well. 2. After autumn, we must work hard to buy livestock for the masses, so that the village's livestock can return to the pre-war level (more than 90 heads before the war, now only more than 50 heads), expand agricultural productivity, and realize the goal of cultivating three and leaving one.

　　东丰稔合作社
    农村合作社的一面旗帜
    张鱼
    一、东丰稔全村由贫变富
    昔阳的模范合作社——东丰稔村合作社不仅成为该村一百三十四户，五百三十八人的经济生活中心，获得全村群众的拥戴，而且也取得附近村庄群众的信仰。成为昔阳农村合作事业的一面旗帜。在社长张振华同志与全体职员的努力下，该社现在拥有的资材计有：二十四万元现金，一百二十多石存粮，几十石麻籽，十六亩土地，一百多只羊，十八口猪，三头驴，一所二十架织布机，六十辆纺车的纺织工厂，一所木工厂和一所规模相当大的油坊；还有一个苗圃。而在民国三十二年春天该社初成立时，全部资金折合起来不过七石玉茭。东丰稔领导全面农副业生产的组织叫“劳力社”，内分农业、副业两部，副业部即合作社，张振华兼任副业部部长。
    三十二年，东丰稔正处于敌我斗争剧烈的游击区，人民离村散居在山沟野地，购买日用必需品极为困难。合作社以八百多元股金与一千四百多元政府贷款成立起来，以供应群众必需品为方针，粉碎了敌伪以布匹、食盐为钓饵欺骗人民“维持”的奸计，使该村成为坚持边地斗争，始终未“维持”敌伪的一个堡垒。但成立不久，即遇到这年大旱灾，于是合作社立即又加上帮助全村群众生产渡荒的方针。是年冬并开办油坊一所。赚的麻饼廉价卖给群众充饥，又设法向敌占区购回粮食四十石廉价调剂使该村平安渡过灾荒。在麻饼价钱上就为群众省洋一万三千多元，这年还给社员分了七千多元红利。
    三十三年响应政府开展大生产运动的号召，东丰稔群众回村居住，合作社业务方针转为以“农业为主，商业为辅”，张振华与合作社全体干部开垦了群众无力再开的一百一十六亩荒地，买骡子，雇长工经营农场。并为保证群众的大生产成功，以赊卖供给群众日用必需品。虽因投资农业周转不灵，和因赊买赊卖受秋季粮跌影响而亏本，但农业生产与冬季的运输和油坊生产上仍获巨利，仅农业生产上一升玉茭的股本即可分得六升红利。
    去冬和今春的冬季生产是东丰稔合作社大发展的关键，也使全村群众由贫变富。合作社组织了全村的冬季大生产。但要组织所有劳力参加运输，却因当时粮贱布贵，许多贫户发愁换不了季出不了门。合作社即提出：“保证群众不籴一颗粮食人人穿棉衣”的口号，从邢台买回了八千多件古衣与四十多匹布赊给他们，又特制油桶赊油让群众运往冀西去赚钱。并允许他们卖油从买回脚货回来卖后再还油钱。这样全村劳力全部投入了这一不用本钱的运销买卖，一冬天使家家发了财，人人穿了新棉衣，还清了全村群众历年积欠的负担与贷款八万二千六百多元，全村买进了十六头牲口，积存了半年食盐，家家办回年货，使贫穷残破的东丰稔喜洋洋的过了个胜利新年。全村老弱妇女也因合作社的组织而从事生产赚钱，老汉由合作社垫款出外收麻籽，卖给合作社油坊每斤可挣一、二元。儿童为合作社磨面，妇女贷花纺织，并为她们成立了纺织工厂。
    今年除继续冬季生产发展副业外，还极力帮助农业生产，加贷款给群众添购了十一头牲口，贷粮帮助了少数人家的青黄不接。合作社油坊又以一斤煤换一斤麻饼的低价，换出麻饼三千多斤，不仅为全村增加了肥料，还节省了一千五百多个运肥工。总之，合作社事业由小变大，东丰稔全村亦由贫变富，两家新来的外来户也由合作社贷款，帮助他们买了地，安家立业。
    二、它从困难中奋斗出来
    一个事业的发展并不是那么一帆风顺，东丰稔合作社也经历过两度几乎垮了台的危机。
    第一次就是三十三年搞农业生产，合作社没经验，不仅农业的利润周转慢，一下把全部资金的百分之九十二用于买骡子，雇长工，陷于周转不灵。当时连饭都吃不上，社长张振华只好引上长工回自己家吃饭。第二次是这年秋天收账和还外债，这年合作社为保证生产运动，照顾群众困难以赊卖供给必需品，货物却是赊买来的，秋天还外欠时粮价大跌。合作社向群众收账不得不照顾群众，以每斤米四十元折价，而合作社还外欠却只能按市价每斤二十五元折，而合作社的资金也是粮食，卖粮还账，几至破产。当时债主日日临门催讨，谴责为难，群众也反映：“不沾，连老本也赔了”。
    但张振华同志并未灰心，他任劳任怨，艰苦支持，终于渡过了这两次难关。一、坚持农业与手工业结合的正确方针，秋后又全力经营油坊与运输。二、合作社干部发扬了艰苦的作风，亲自下油坊一天一槽的榨油，又亲自赶牲口往返运销。这样辛苦干了四、五个月，终于赚回了亏欠，还盈余了一万多元。又使合作社向前发展了。
    三、群众路线与计算作风
    东丰稔合作社的一切业务方针是从群众需要，为群众服务来的，同样，它的一切具体作法，每一细节，无一不是为群众的利益着想，走群众路线，这中间又贯穿了一个全心全意为群众的精确计算的作风。张振华同志懂得：“一切事情脱离群众就完蛋”，“群众的利益即合作社的利益”、下面我们再谈几个事实：（一）分红：三十二年第一次分红，当时有许多贫苦社员只报名认了股却还没有缴股。这样的社员分不分红呢？在社内引起争论，结果通过了张振华的主张：“分”，理由是：政府贷款是按股贷给，他们虽未缴股，却有人家的一股贷款，他们并非故意不缴而是因为穷，更应以分红来扶助他们入股。这个问题经过全村在民校的辩论，决定了按每股应分红利的一半分给他们。（二）营业原则是一切按群众需要，合作社不怕麻烦，群众不仅可以赊欠，而且无论什么东西，一把米，一穗玉茭，一个鸡蛋等等都可以向合作社换得等价的东西，也可以换得钱。东丰稔合作社虽未办信用业务，但给群众通融贷款也是常事。因之群众有事向合作社商量，合作社有事也向群众商量，合作社成了全村男女老少日常聚会的中心。连附近的村子也愿上东丰稔合作社买东西。（三）外欠问题：东丰稔虽因外欠问题遭遇过危机，当时虽合作社急须向外偿债，它也准许实在拿不出的群众继续拖欠。这中间虽有情面与恩赐观点成份，但经过一次检讨他们并未取消赊卖，而进一步认识为了使农民随时能获得其需要的货物或货币，使其不致被迫高价买必需品或低价出卖自己的生产品，而应向其赊卖或贷款，只要组织群众生产发财，外欠是容易收起来的。（四）精确计算，如组织去冬大生产，是经过计算，以全村基本群众四百余人换季（棉衣）与偿还历年所欠负担、贷款为目标，经过二十天运输赚八万多元，遂又扩大计划以再增购十六头牲口为目标，具体组织，终于完成。又如运油中许多农民因不识秤不懂行情吃亏，合作社即为他们改造组织与领导。又如运煤中间曾经是直接从煤窑向邢台运，但经过计算才知先运到村，再向邢台运可节省时日。
    东丰稔合作社的成功，就是群众路线与计算的结合。它成立以来使群众获得很大利益、分过五六次红，“勤分红”是它的原则之一，它懂得分红多容易扩股，群众得利愈多合作社愈雄厚，这样合作社就获得飞快的发展。
    四、全村拥戴的“窑底家”
    “窑底家”就是张振华同志，东丰稔群众提到这三个字时有无限的亲切之感。东丰稔合作社是与他离不开的。他舍己为人，他全身为群众服务，除吃饭外没有报酬，合作社最困难的时候还回家吃饭，自己家里的土地却雇人耕种，他毫无怨言，只在去年合作社发展了，才规定全年有两匹布。他作风民主，和村上其他干部团结极好，合作社的事他总和干部商量，村上工作他们积极帮助。他态度谦虚，合作社困难时他不气馁，成功时也不骄傲，他常说：“领导好，群众条件好，是咱合作社办好的基本条件”。
    该村群众反映：没有“窑底家”，合作社的光景早完了。张振华同志数年来如一日，兢兢业业克苦耐劳，专心于群众的合作事业，使今天的东丰稔合作社，成为农村合作事业中的一面旗帜，但他并不自满，他说：他还要继续努力今后合作社发展的方针，一、要好好发展妇女纺织。二、秋后还要努力，替群众买牲口，使本村牲口能恢复战前水平（战前为九十多头现在只有五十多头），扩大农业生产力，实现耕三余一。
