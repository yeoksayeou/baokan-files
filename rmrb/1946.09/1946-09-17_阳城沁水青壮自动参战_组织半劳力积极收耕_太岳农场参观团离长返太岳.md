　　Yangcheng and Qinshui Youths Voluntarily Join the War
    Organize Semi-able-bodied Labor to Actively Harvest
    Taiyue Farm Delegation Leaves Changzhi to Return to Taiyue

    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 14th dispatch] In the intense patriotic self-defense war, after the vast number of youths in Yangcheng and Qinshui voluntarily went to war, the village cadres in the rear actively organized semi-able-bodied labor to engage in the autumn harvest and planting movement. In Xigou Village, Yangcheng, there are a total of 596 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, of which 190 able-bodied laborers have all supported the front lines. The remaining 406 semi-able-bodied laborers, under the organization and leadership of the village cadres, formed 51 mutual aid teams. Within five days, all 1,128 mu of grain fields in the village have been harvested. Shuicun Natural Village in the First District also organized 64 semi-able-bodied laborers in six days to harvest 165 mu of millet. Eighty-four women and children in Jiangli Village harvested 91.03 mu of grain in one day. The Mutual Aid United Brigade of Yanshan Village in the Sixth District specifically proposed the call to harvest and plant early to prepare to support the front lines. In the two days of the 4th and 5th of this month, they completed 69,889 "leaf branches" (i.e., weeds and leaves on the field ridges) for fertilizing 3,500 mu of wheat fields, which can prevent the weeds on 9,656 field ridges from growing again next year. Nine children in Lujiahe of the brigade reaped 8,000 jin of "leaf branches" and have already begun to fertilize and plant wheat. The Laoying Jin Bingqian Mutual Aid Brigade in Baihua Village, Qinshui, purchased 500 sickles, 2,000 jin of edible salt, and other agricultural implements worth a total of 500,000 yuan before the autumn harvest and planting. Because tools and daily necessities were prepared early, as soon as the autumn harvest and planting began, all labor and livestock were mobilized to participate in the movement. It is estimated that 870 mu of wheat fields can be planted within ten days.

    [Changzhi, 13th dispatch] The Taiyue First Farm delegation of four people arrived in this city at the end of August to visit the Changzhi Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and exchange experiences between the two places. They visited for six days before returning to Taiyue. In addition to highly praising the Changzhi Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the delegation also introduced various methods successfully tested in the Taiyue area, such as the millet borer control method, wheat disinfection method, sweet melon root and fruit pest control method, and a new type of drill invented in Taiyue recently. This drill is shaped like a chair, light and labor-saving, with a pestle attached behind the drill, so that planting and pestling are completed in one step. The person controlling the drill does not need to shake it, so it is not restricted by technology and can be used by everyone. The Changzhi Agriculture and Forestry Bureau has decided to send people to retrieve the model for imitation and promotion in this area. (Wen Hui)

　　阳城沁水青壮自动参战
    组织半劳力积极收耕
    太岳农场参观团离长返太岳
    【本报阳城十四日电】在紧张的爱国自卫战争中，阳城沁水广大青壮年自动出征参战后，村干部在后方即积极组织半劳力投入秋收秋种运动。阳城西沟村全村全半劳力共五百九十六个，其中一百九十个全劳力已全部支援前线，剩余的四百零六个半劳力，在村干部的组织领导下，组成了五十一个互助小组。五天内全村一千一百二十八亩谷田，已收割完竣。一区水村自然村亦于六日内组织半劳力六十四人，收割谷子一百六十五亩。匠礼村妇女儿童八十四人，一天割谷九十一亩零三分。六区岩山村互助联合大队特别提出早收早种，准备支援前线的号召，在本月四五两天内完成可供三千五百亩麦地熏粪的“叶枝”（即田陇上的杂草叶枝）六万九千八百八十九个，这样可使九千六百五十六道田陇杂草明年不会再长。该大队芦家河九个儿童即刹“叶枝”八千斤，现在已经开始熏粪种麦。沁水白桦村劳英靳秉乾互助大队在秋收秋种前，即购好镰刀五百张，食盐两千斤，以及其他农具共值五十万元。由于工具及日用品早有准备，所以秋收下种开始，即动员全体劳力畜力投入运动，预计十天内八百七十亩麦田可以种完。
    【长治十三日电】太岳第一农场参观团一行四人，于八月底抵本市，参观长治农林局，并交流两地经验。前后参观六天，现已返太岳。该团除对长治农林局大加称赞外，并介绍太岳区试验成功之谷子钻心虫防治法，麦子消毒法，治甜瓜根果害虫法等多种及太岳近制出之新耧一种。此耧形如椅子，轻便省力，耧后带碓，下种与碓地一次即成，掌耧人不用摇动，因之不受技术限制，人人可用。长治农林局已决定派人前往取回模型仿制，以便在本区推广。（文辉）
