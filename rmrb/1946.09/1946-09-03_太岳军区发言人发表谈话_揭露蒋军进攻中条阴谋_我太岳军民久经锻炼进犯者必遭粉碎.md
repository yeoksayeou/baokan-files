　　[This dispatch from Yangcheng, 30th] In recent days, Chiang Kai-shek's army in southern Shanxi has launched a large-scale offensive against our Zhongtiao Mountains area, capturing the strategically important river defense town of Yuanqu County, and the war is intensifying. A spokesperson for the Taiyue Military Region stated: Chiang Kai-shek's army, with nine divisions, has launched a new offensive in southern Shanxi. Its direct aim is clearly to divide and encircle our Zhongtiao liberated area, and then, with vicious tactics of joint attacks and suppression, eliminate our army and civilians who are holding out in the Zhongtiao Mountains liberated area, in order to control the Zhongtiao Mountains area and the ferry crossings of Yuanqu and Maojin, etc., consolidating its occupied areas in southern Shanxi as a large garrison, and then coordinate with Chiang's army on the Pinghan, Longhai, and Zhengtai lines for a larger-scale all-out offensive against the liberated areas. The military region spokesperson continued: Recalling the Battle of Zhongtiao in 1941, the Kuomintang's 200,000-strong army collapsed without a fight in the face of the Japanese invaders, not only abandoning the people of southern Shanxi but also creating a large number of bandits and secret agents who colluded with the Japanese to inflict suffering on the people. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army marched south, swept away the enemy and puppets, and established democratic power. Since 1942, our Zhongtiao liberated area has stood firm on the north bank of the Yellow River, attacking the Japanese invaders in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, and in 1944, it cooperated with the Henan campaign, containing the enemy's offensive. Its military achievements are well known throughout the country. Since the counter-offensive last year, it has successively liberated the county towns of Yuncheng, Yanchi, Pinglu, Xiaxian, and Yuanqu. Now, Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's puppet troops are coming to "recover lost territory" from the hands of the Eighth Route Army. Their madness knows no bounds! The spokesperson concluded: The Kuomintang army's invasion of the Zhongtiao Mountains area has caused heavy losses to the people's houses and property, even worse than the Japanese invaders' "three alls policy." The Taiyue army and civilians, who have been battle-tested for a long time, are using their flesh and blood to engage in a war of self-defense, defending peace and democracy. Here, Chiang's army will encounter difficulties it cannot overcome, and Chiang Kai-shek's offensive will inevitably be crushed by the people!

　　太岳军区发言人发表谈话
    揭露蒋军进攻中条阴谋
    我太岳军民久经锻炼进犯者必遭粉碎
    【本报阳城三十日电】晋南蒋军日来大举进攻我中条山区，陷我河防重镇垣曲县城，战争日趋严重。太岳军区发言人称：蒋介石军以九师之众在晋南发动新的攻势，其直接目的，显然在于将我中条解放区实行分割包围，然后以合击清剿之毒辣手段，消灭我坚持于中条山解放区军民，以便控制中条山区与垣曲茅津等渡口，巩固其在晋南侵占区域，作为一个大的屯兵场，进而配合平汉陇海正太各线蒋军向解放区更大规模的全面进攻。军区发言人继称：回忆民国三十年中条战役，国民党二十万大军在日寇进攻面前，不战而溃，不仅弃晋南人民于不顾，且制造大批土匪特务，勾结日寇，荼毒人民，幸赖八路军挥兵南下，扫除敌伪，建立民主政权。自三十一年以来，我中条解放区屹立黄河北岸，打击晋南豫北日寇，并于三十三年配合河南战役，牵制敌寇进攻，战功卓著，全国皆知，去年反攻以来，复先后解放运城盐池平陆夏县垣曲等县城，现在蒋阎伪军却来八路军手中“收复失地”，丧心病狂，莫此为甚！发言人最后称：国民党军此次侵入中条山区，人民房屋财产损失惨重，甚于日寇“三光政策”，久经百战的太岳军民，正以他们的血肉来投入自卫战争，保卫和平民主，蒋军在此，将遇到他不能克服的困难，蒋介石的进攻必为人民所粉碎！
