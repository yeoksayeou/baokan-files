    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Shanghai News: Atrocities by American soldiers in Shanghai are increasing daily. At Guangci Hospital alone, the number of Chinese people injured by American military jeeps in August and sent to the hospital reached 35. Among them, 5 died from their injuries, 20 were seriously injured, and 10 were slightly injured. In early September, there were three or four letters to the Wenhui Daily exposing the unprovoked violence of American soldiers. According to a letter from a victim who was beaten, at about 10 p.m. on September 1, he was slashed in the mouth and legs by three or four American sailors with knives on Avenue Joffre, leaving him bleeding profusely. A shop assistant, Wang Konggu, wrote that on the 5th, an American naval officer came out of nowhere, groundlessly accused him of stealing his leather bag, and beat the shop assistants indiscriminately, threatening to arrest them. At 10 a.m. on September 9, Lu Yongfu, a 52-year-old worker at the News Bureau, was killed by a fully loaded ten-wheeled truck carrying American soldiers on Avenue Joffre and Rue Cardinal Mercier. Another Nanjing dispatch reports that on August 27, two incidents of American soldiers committing violence occurred in Nanjing in one day. In the morning, an American military vehicle sped along Zhujiang Road, damaging a Chinese-owned car. The American driver became angry and beat the Chinese driver, leaving his face and nose bruised. Passers-by were indignant. On the same evening, in front of the American military club on Zhongshan East Road, a drunken American soldier was pulling and tugging at a dancing girl in the middle of the street, which greatly displeased passers-by. A policeman happened to pass by and tried to dissuade him, but the arrogant American soldier punched and kicked him, causing the policeman to spit blood. An old woman passing by with her young grandson was also knocked to the ground. Onlookers were furious and shouted repeatedly, "It's a disgrace to China! Hand over the American soldier who committed the crime!" At this time, more than a dozen American soldiers had dragged the culprit into the club. Soon after, a police brigade was dispatched and used machine guns to disperse the crowd, and the humiliated dancing girl was also taken to the police station to be "dealt with according to the law."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Following the first batch of 185 American military dependents stationed in China, who landed in Tanggu on the 17th and transferred to Beiping, another batch of American military dependents landed in Shanghai yesterday. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 22nd, a group of 95 American military dependents arrived in Shanghai a few hours ago. They stepped onto this "novel" land for the first time, where they will "make their home" for the next year or even longer.
