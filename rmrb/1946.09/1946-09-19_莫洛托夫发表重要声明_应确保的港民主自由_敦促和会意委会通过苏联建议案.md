　　Molotov Issues Important Statement
    Democratic Freedoms in Hong Kong Must Be Ensured
    Urges the Peace Conference Italian Committee to Pass the Soviet Proposal
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th】Paris Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered an important statement at the Peace Conference's Italian Political Committee on the 14th, urging the committee to pass the Soviet proposal regarding the Free Territory of Trieste. During the Second Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, a principled recommendation was made on this issue, but in subsequent consultations, the four powers put forward specific drafts that were inconsistent with each other. Molotov first criticized the drafts proposed by Britain, the United States, and France, stating: The British and American drafts give all power to the governor, and the French draft does so to some extent as well. Molotov compared the governor in the British draft to the governors of India and British West Africa. Molotov said, "We cannot regard Trieste as a colony, nor can we regard it as a military base for certain foreign countries." Molotov continued: The Soviet draft respects the basic principles adopted by the four powers, which fully consider the interests of the people of Trieste and give Trieste a democratic body of written law to ensure these interests. Molotov announced the ten key points of the Soviet draft at the meeting: (1) The Free Territory of Trieste should be a neutral and demilitarized zone. (2) Foreign troops currently stationed in the Free Territory of Trieste should withdraw within thirty days after the Treaty of Peace with Italy comes into effect. (3) To ensure the favorable development of the Free Territory of Trieste, economic cooperation should be established between the Free Territory and Yugoslavia (such as a customs union and joint management of the Free Territory's railways). (4) The international management organization of Trieste should stipulate that the port and transit facilities should be shared by the entire international trade and neighboring countries (Yugoslavia and Italy). (5) Ensuring compliance with the Free Territory's regulations is the responsibility of the governor. (6) Legislative power should be exercised by the People's Assembly, which is produced by equal, direct, and secret universal suffrage. (7) Executive power is entrusted to the Free Territory government, which is elected by the People's Assembly and accountable to the People's Assembly; all institutions exercising political power are subordinate to the government, including police and border coastal defense. (8) Citizenship of the Free Territory of Trieste will be granted to former Italian citizens who resided in the area as of June 10, 1940, and still reside in the area on the date the Treaty of Peace with Italy comes into effect. However, the right to obtain citizenship of the Free Territory does not apply to active supporters of the Italian Fascist regime, activists of the Fascist Party, war criminals, former Italian police officers, and government officials who moved in from Italy after 1922. (9) An Allied Commission should be established, including representatives from the four countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, which should consult with local democratic party groups to organize a provisional government for the Free Territory after the Treaty of Peace with Italy comes into effect. (10) The special task of the provisional government is to implement elections within three months to establish the People's Assembly. The second part of Molotov's speech was a criticism of the Australian representative's proposal to replace the Security Council's management of the Free Territory of Trieste with a special committee. The Australian representative explained that his opposition was because the Security Council has the power of veto. Molotov said: The international organization created the power of veto in the work of establishing world peace and security for the first time in history. If the power of veto did not exist, then this organization would become the League of Nations again. The League of Nations was actually a tool for the rule of the British and French blocs, and the result was Munich and World War II. If the power of veto is abolished, it may give people in those new power blocs an opportunity, for example, to form an Anglo-American bloc, in order to divide spheres of influence or to obliterate the interests of other peace-loving countries. However, this attempt will be futile and will inevitably fail as it has in the past. Molotov finally pointed out: If we have inconsistencies, then we must find ways to eliminate them. In any case, we cannot embark on the dangerous road of the old League of Nations.

　　莫洛托夫发表重要声明
    应确保的港民主自由
    敦促和会意委会通过苏联建议案
    【新华社延安十六日电】巴黎讯：苏外长莫洛托夫于十四日在和会意大利政治委员会上发表重要声明，敦促委员会通过苏联关于的里雅斯特自由区之建议案。第二次巴黎外长会议中，关于此一问题曾作出原则的建议，但在此后磋商时，四强又提出了并不一致的具体草案。莫氏首先批评英美法所提出草案宣称：英美草案把全部权力都给予总督，而法国的草案在某种程度上也是如此。莫氏将英国草案中的总督比作印度及英属西菲洲殖民地的总督。莫氏称：“我们不能把的里雅斯特看作殖民地，也不能看作是某些外国的军事基地。”莫氏继称：苏草案尊重四强通过之基本原则，这些原则充分考虑的里雅斯特人民的利益，并给予的里雅斯特一个民主的成文法规，以确保这些利益。莫氏在会上宣布苏联草案的十个要点为：（一）的里雅斯特自由区应为中立而不设防之区域。（二）现驻的里雅斯特自由区之外国军队，应于对意和约生效后三十日内撤退。（三）为确保的里雅斯特自由区之有利发展，自由区与南斯拉夫间应建立经济合作（如关税同盟及共管自由区之铁路等）。（四）的里雅斯特之国际管理机构，应规定的港及转运设施应由整个国际贸易及毗邻国家（南斯拉夫意大利）所共享。（五）保证自由区法规之遵守为总督之责任。（六）立法权应由人民议会行使，该议会以平等直接秘密之普选方式产生。（七）行政权委托自由区政府行使，政府由人民议会选出，并对人民议会负责；行使政权之一切机构均隶属政府，包括警政及边界海防等。（八）的里雅斯特自由区之公民权，将授予前意大利之公民，此种公民限于一九四○年六月十日即居住该区，面对意和约生效之日仍居住该区者。然获得自由区公民之权利，不适用于意大利法西斯政权之积极拥护者、法西斯党之活动分子、战犯、曾任意大利警察者及一九二二年以后自意大利移入之政府官员等。（九）应成立盟国委员会，包括英美苏法四国代表，该委员会应与当地之民主党派团体磋商在对意和约生效之后组织自由区临时政府。（十）临时政府之特殊任务，为在三个月内实施选举，以成立人民议会。莫氏演说的第二部分，是抨击澳代表主张以特别委员会代替安理会管理的里雅斯特自由区的建议。澳代表解释说他的反对是因为安理会有否决权。莫氏称：国际组织在建立世界和平与安全工作中创造了否决权，这在历史上尚属首次，如否决权不存在了，那这一组织又将变成国际联盟，国际联盟实际上是英法集团的统治工具，结果是慕尼黑和第二次大战。否决权如果取消，就可能给那些新强权集团的人们以机会，例如说成立美英集团，以便瓜分势力范围，或者得以抹煞其他爱好和平国家的利益。可是这一企图是一无所得的，必然和过去一样的失败。莫氏最后指出：如果我们有不协调之处，则必须设法予以消除，无论如何，不能踏上旧国联的危险道路。
