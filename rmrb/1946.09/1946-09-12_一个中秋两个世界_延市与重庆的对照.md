Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 9th: Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. Farmers from the four townships of Yan'an are flocking to the market to buy holiday goods. More than a hundred food stores are baking mooncakes overnight for sale. The supply of meat and vegetables is struggling to meet demand. The prices of rice, meat, and cloth have only risen by an average of 7.5% compared to a month ago, while the prices of flour and eggs have even decreased. Next to the blackboard newspaper in the new market, people are enthusiastically reading the good news from the western section of the Longhai Railway. The situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the Mid-Autumn Festival is completely different. As early as two months ago, people in the business community predicted that the economy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas would be in a state of total collapse during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Due to the expansion of the civil war, the Chiang government is desperately conscripting grain and soldiers. Furthermore, since prices soared on the 19th of last month, prices in Chongqing have risen by more than 50%. Many businesses in major cities have closed down.

　　一个中秋两个世界
    延市与重庆的对照
    【新华社延安九日电】明日中秋节延安四乡农民，纷至市场购买节货，百余家食品店连夜烘制月饼上市，肉菜有供不应求之势，米肉布的价格平均只比一个月以前上涨百分之七点五，而面粉鸡蛋价格还比以前降低。新市场的黑板报旁，人们热情阅读陇海路西的捷报。中秋节在蒋管区情况，则迥然不同，早在两个月以前，工商界人士曾预言中秋节蒋管区经济将呈总崩溃现象。由于内战扩大，蒋政府拚命征粮征丁，加以自上月十九日物价飞涨，重庆物价高涨百分之五十以上，各大城市并有许多商号倒闭。
