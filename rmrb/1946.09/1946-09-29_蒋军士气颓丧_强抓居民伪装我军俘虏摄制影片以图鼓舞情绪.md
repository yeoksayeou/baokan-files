Xinhua News Agency, Central Jiangsu, 26th—The Chiang Kai-shek troops invading Central Jiangsu, after suffering repeated defeats, forcibly seized peaceful residents and forced them to impersonate New Fourth Army prisoners of war to film "victories" for propaganda in the Chiang-controlled areas to boost their declining morale. According to Gao Ru-kuan and Gao Shan-er, residents of Meijiawan, Xuanbao District, who escaped from Taizhou on August 11, the Chiang Kai-shek army's 83rd Division (formerly renamed from the 100th Army) raided Daxu Jiabao, Zhang Jiabao, Meijiabao, and other places in the district on July 27, capturing more than 200 residents. They were taken to Taixian City and forced to shave their heads and wear gray military uniforms. They were organized into classes of fifteen, each carrying a "Prisoner of War Brigade" banner, led by escort soldiers, and shouting "We are New Fourth Army prisoners." They marched to the Red Cross Society site, where the Kuomintang Central Film Studio's newsreel team filmed them. Afterward, more than 40 young and strong individuals were selected, ordered to carry empty guns and ammunition pouches, and transported by car to the outskirts of the East Gate, where they pretended to be dead bodies on the battlefield and continued filming several scenes. After filming, all the more than 200 people were dressed in yellow military uniforms and sent to Zhenjiang in batches to become soldiers. Gao Ru-kuan and others were among those who escaped midway.

　　蒋军士气颓丧
　　强抓居民伪装我军俘虏摄制影片以图鼓舞情绪
    【新华社苏中二十六日电】侵犯苏中蒋军，在连遭挫败后，乃强抓和平居民，迫令伪装新四军俘虏摄入新闻影片，向蒋管区宣传“胜利”，鼓励其颓丧士气。据八月十一日自泰州逃回之宣堡区梅家堰居民高如宽、高山儿等谈称：泰县蒋军八十三师（原一百军改称）七月廿七日窜至该区大小许家堡、张家堡、梅家堡等地，抓去居民二百余人，至泰县城迫令一律光头换穿灰色军装，以十五人为一班，手持“俘虏大队”旗帜，沿途由押解兵领队，高呼“我们是新四军俘虏”，行至红十会屋址，由国民党中央摄影场新闻摄影队将其摄入镜头之后，又挑选出四十余少壮者，令背上空枪及弹袋，用汽车载至东门外郊，假装战场死尸，继续拍摄数景。摄毕后，二百余人均换上黄军装，分批送往镇江当兵。高如宽等系中途逃脱者。
