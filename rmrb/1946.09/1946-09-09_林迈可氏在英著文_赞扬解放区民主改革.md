Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 6th: TASS, London: The magazine "The Spectator" published a letter from Michael Lindsay, who traveled in China for several years and recently returned to London, contrasting the corruption in the Kuomintang areas with the democratic reforms in the Communist areas, and criticizing the United States for supporting the Kuomintang's anti-communism. The letter stated: Many people have lost confidence in the Kuomintang's hopes for reform after the end of the war of resistance, because the Kuomintang's secret service activities have been strengthened, honest and capable officials are not appointed and lose power, and in the recovered areas, all rights have been handed over to the most corrupt elements within the Kuomintang, even to those who have had connections with the enemy. The Communist Party, however, has truly implemented reforms. Rescued American airmen and army observers have personally experienced the Communist areas of North and Central China. They all said that the people in the Communist-controlled areas are obviously well-fed and clothed, and are loved by the local army and officials. The government there is extremely clean and honest, and has implemented thorough, courageous, and extensive political, economic, and social reforms. Finally, the letter stated: The Kuomintang people firmly believe that they can eventually obtain American support to oppose the Communist Party without handing over part of their power to implement reforms. As long as the United States continues to support the unreformed Kuomintang government, the Soviet Union has every reason to doubt the sincerity of the United States' concern for democracy in Europe.

    赞扬解放区民主改革
    【新华社延安六日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：《傍观者》杂志发表曾旅行中国数年、而于最近返抵伦敦之林迈可来信一封，将国民党地区的腐败与共产党地区的民主改革作一对照，并指责美国支持国民党反共。该信称：很多人对国民党在抗战结束后会实行改革的希望，已失去信心，因为国民党特务活动已加强，廉洁而贤能的官吏不被任用而失势，在收复区一切权利交给了国民党内最腐败的分子，甚至给那些曾与敌人有瓜葛的人们。而共产党却真正的实行了改革，被救的美国空军人员与陆军观察家，曾亲历华北与华中各共产党地区，他们都说共产党统治区的人民显然均丰衣足食，并为地方军队与官员所爱护，那里极端廉洁的政府，实行了彻底的勇敢的广泛的政治、经济、社会改革。最后该信称：国民党人深信他们最后可得到美国支持以反对共产党，而不用交出一部分政权实行改革。只要美国仍支持未改组的国民党政府，则苏联有一切理由怀疑美国关心欧洲民主的诚意。
