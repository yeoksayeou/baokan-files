American Reactionaries Support Japanese Bandits
　　--Written to Commemorate the "September 18th" Incident

　　Japanese fascism has been defeated for a year, but it has not been completely eliminated because American reactionaries are now supporting the remaining forces of Japanese fascism. The American reactionaries' policy towards Japan today reminds us of the policy of American reactionaries towards Japan during the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago and for the fifteen years since then. It is meaningful for us Chinese people to commemorate "September 18th" today and review this period of history as a warning. What attitude did the American authorities take during the "September 18th" Incident? At that time, the American imperialist reactionaries, represented by Secretary of State Stimson, adopted a policy of appeasement towards Japanese imperialism. When Japanese militarists and zaibatsu Aikawa Yoshisuke plundered manpower and resources in our Northeast to establish a steel concern, the reactionary American monopoly capitalists cooperated with the Japanese zaibatsu. The well-known Ford and Duesen companies supplied Aikawa's Manchurian Heavy Industries with modern metallurgical technology, making it the "King of the Japanese Steel Industry." The entire technological system of the Nakajima zaibatsu, the pioneer of the Japanese aircraft industry, was established with the support of the American Mellon and Ford financial groups. From June 1932 to June 1937, the United States accounted for 45 percent of Japan's foreign military trade. With the help of American financial groups, Japanese fascism laid the foundation for modern military industry and dared to launch the "July 7th" Incident and invade our country on a large scale.

　　After the "July 7th" Incident, the actions of the American imperialist reactionaries ran counter to the aid-China movement of the broad masses of the American people, and regardless of the protests of many righteous members of Congress, and even the opposition of many democrats in the government at that time, they took advantage of the opportunity of Japan's war industrial organization in the war of aggression against China to do military business with the Japanese financial groups. According to the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry's announcement on April 1, 1940, the proportion of American trade with Japan to Japan's total foreign trade since 1937 was as follows: 33.5 percent in 1937, 34.3 percent in 1938, 34.3 percent in 1939, and 38.7 percent in the first three months of 1940, and this continued until the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident. According to materials revealed by American journalists, the help of reactionary American financial groups to Japan has increased rather than decreased. For example, the shipbuilding technology of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was improved with the help of American financial groups. The American Rockefeller financial group not only supplied Japan with oil but also helped Mitsui and Sumitomo establish a new oil industry with modern technology, and Japan's aluminum industry only had a modern technological scale by the spring of 1941 with the assistance of the American Mellon financial group. Until the end of September 1941, 70 percent of the scrap iron needed by the Japanese steel industry still relied on the supply of American financial groups. These American reactionaries are undoubtedly responsible for the American soldiers who sacrificed in the Pearl Harbor Incident.

　　After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the American people and the ruling group headed by Roosevelt fought side by side with us Chinese people, but some of the most reactionary financial groups in American monopoly capital, which had international cartel connections with Japan, still maintained close ties with the Japanese financial groups. At that time, it was widely rumored in the United States that through "neutral countries" such as Argentina, the American Morgan financial group and Mitsui Mitsubishi still maintained a delicate relationship secretly. It is said that in the spring of 1943, Japan was still able to buy American machine tools from "neutral countries" using submarines. Later, as the Pacific War intensified and American soldiers shed blood and sacrificed in Saipan and Okinawa, the American reactionaries did not want Japan to be completely defeated. They secretly discussed conspiracies and compromises with the Japanese financial groups in Argentina and Lisbon. After the Potsdam Proclamation was issued, the reactionaries represented by Truman, Special Assistant to the State Department, simultaneously declared that the United States hoped that Japan would be ruled by financial groups after the war.

　　According to the Potsdam Proclamation, the United States has the treaty obligation and the responsibility to eliminate the reactionary military and financial fascist forces and implement democratic reforms in Japan's political, economic, and social aspects, but the US State Department, with the assistance of reactionary elements Grew and Truman in September of last year, redefined the US policy towards Japan in violation of the Potsdam Declaration, so MacArthur has nakedly supported the Japanese reactionaries and suppressed the Japanese democratic forces for the past year.

　　Today, an emperor who should be held responsible for war crimes is allowed to exist legally by the United States. The forces of the Kwantung Army, which were the culprits of the "September 18th" Incident, are still allowed to remain hidden in the American-occupied area of southern Korea, and Kim Man-rip, a well-known pro-Japanese traitor who was a henchman of the Kwantung Army, has joined forces with Kim Gu and others to form a temporary government. All the giants of the military-nationalist moderates, such as Shidehara, Yoshida, Inukai Ken, and Izawa Takio, are regarded as treasures by American imperialism and are doing their best to support them.

　　It is particularly worth pointing out that since the resumption of international cartel activities by American and Japanese monopoly capital in May of this year, the industrial production of Japanese financial groups has gradually recovered. On August 12, the Yoshida Cabinet declared that the restoration of the financial zaibatsu Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda had been completed, and said that Japan had begun the so-called "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan," and one of the plans was to borrow foreign capital from the United States through Keita Gotō and Shinsuke Nagasaki to develop transportation undertakings. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and others plan to jointly establish various development undertakings with American financial groups at home and abroad, with American capital as the leading factor, using American technology, with Japanese labor, and seeking the market of the gold standard empire. At the same time, Japanese financial groups are also trying to follow the gold standard forces to get involved in China.

　　Obviously, today, one year after MacArthur's control, the remaining forces of Japanese fascism are becoming more rampant due to the support of American imperialism. Today, on the anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, the pain of the Chinese people has not healed, and the memory is still fresh. We will never allow the American imperialism to support Japan to launch a second "September 18th" Incident.

### 美国反动派扶持日寇——为纪念“九一八”而作

　　美国反动派扶持日寇
    ——为纪念“九一八”而作
    尹光
    日本法西斯毕竟被打垮一年了，但它没有彻底被消灭，因为美国反动派今天正在扶持日本法西斯的残余势力。美国反动派今天对日本的政策，使我们想起了十五年前九一八事变时以及从那时以后十五年来美国反动派的对日政策。我们中国人民今天纪念“九一八”，回顾一下这段历史以为警惕是有意义的。“九一八”事变时，美国当局采取什么态度呢？当时以国务卿史汀生为代表的美国帝国主义反动派，是对日本帝国主义采取了纵容的政策，当日本军阀、财阀鲇川义介在我东北搜刮人力和资源建立钢铁康采仑时，美国反动的独占资本家即和日本财阀合作。举世周知的福特公司与德森公司供给了鲇川的满洲重工业公司的现代化的冶金技术，使它成为“日本钢铁工业之王。”日本飞机工业的鼻祖中岛财阀全部康采仑的技术体系，却是美国梅隆财阀与福特财阀的扶助下建立起来的。在一九三二年六月至一九三七年六月，日本对外军需贸易中，美国竟占了百分之四十五。就在美国财阀的帮助下，日本法西斯才打下了现代化的军需工业的基础，也才有恃无恐敢于发动“七七”事变，大规模侵略我国。
    而在“七七”事变后，美国帝国主义反动派的行动与美国广大人民的援华运动背道而驰，并不顾国会中许多有正义感之议员的抗议，更不顾当时政府中不少民主分子的反对，而利用日本在侵华战争中进行战争工业编组的时机与日本财阀大做军火生意。据日本工商省一九四○年四月一日公布，美国一九三七年以来对日贸易，占日本对外全部贸易的比率如下：一九三七年占百分之三十三点五，一九三八年占三十四点三，一九三九年占三十四点三，一九四○年前三个月占百分之三十八点七，这样一直到珍珠港事变前夕。据美国记者透露的材料，美国反动财阀对日的帮助仍有加无减，如三菱重工业公司的造船技术是美国财阀帮他改良的，美国洛克菲财阀不但供给日本石油，并且帮助了三井和住友建立现代技术的新兴石油工业，而日本的制铝工业是到了一九四一年春季因为美国梅隆财阀的协助才具有现代化的技术规模。一直到一九四一年九月底，日本钢铁工业中所须的废铁还有百分之七十依靠美国财阀供给。美国这些反动派，无疑是要对珍珠港事变中牺牲的美国士兵负责的。
    太平洋战争爆发后，美国人民大众与罗斯福为首的执政集团，即和我们中国人民并肩抗战了，但是美国独占资本中一部分最反动的与日本有国际卡特尔联系的财阀，竟然还和日本财阀藕断丝连。当时即在美国也盛传通过阿根廷这类“中立国”，美国摩根财阀与三井三菱仍暗中维持微妙关系。据说在一九四三年春日本还能用潜水挺由“中立国”买到美国工作母机，嗣后太平洋战争激烈展开，美国兵士在塞班和大琉球流血牺牲，美国反动派却不愿日本彻底失败，他们在阿根廷在里斯本擅和日本财阀暗中计议阴谋妥协，至后波茨顿文告发布，以国务院特别助理杜曼为代表的反动派，则同时宣称美国希望战后日本由财阀统治。
    依照波茨顿文告，美国有履行条约的义务，有责任肃清反动的军阀与财阀法西斯势力，使日本政治经济和社会各方面实行民主改革，但是美国务院在去年九月由反动分子格鲁与杜曼协助下，厘定了波茨顿宣言相违背的美国对日政策，所以麦克阿瑟一年来便赤裸裸的扶助日本反动派，压制日本民主势力。
    到今天，一个应负战争罪犯责任的天皇，被美国允许合法存在了。“九一八”事变祸首的关东军势力，在朝鲜南部的美军占领区还容其残余埋伏下来，而关东军的爪牙著名的韩奸金满立则与金九等合伙成立临时政府，一切军国主义稳健派的巨头如币原、吉由、犬养健、伊泽多喜男等等，更为美帝国主义视同珍宝而竭力撑它们的腰。
    特别值得指出，美日独占资本从今年五月又开始国际卡特尔活动以来，日本财阀的工业生产已着着恢复。八月十二日，吉田内阁声明金融财阀三井、三菱、住友和安田等等康采仑的复员已经完成，并说日本开始所谓“五年经济再建计划”，而这计划之一，即以五岛庆太、长崎新＠之助等向美国借入外资，兴办交通事业。而三井、三菱等则计划在国内与海外与美国财阀合股举办各种开拓事业，以美资本为主导，用美国技术，配日本劳力，觅求金元帝国的市场。同时日本财阀还力图跟随金元势力染指中国。
    显而易见，在麦克阿瑟管制一年后的今天，日本法西斯的残余势力，由于美帝国主义的扶持而日见猖獗了。今天逢到“九一八”纪念日，中国人民的伤痛未愈，记忆犹新，我们再不容许美帝国主义扶持下日本再来第二次“九一八”事变。
