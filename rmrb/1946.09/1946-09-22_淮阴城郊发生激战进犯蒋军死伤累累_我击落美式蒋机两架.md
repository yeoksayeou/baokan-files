Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, urgent telegram, 19th, 1:00 AM: As of the time of this dispatch, Huaiyin city is still firmly defended by the New Fourth Army. Fierce battles continue in the suburbs, and the invading Chiang troops have suffered heavy casualties. The Central News Agency's report that Chiang troops captured Huaiyin on the 17th is completely accurate.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin Front, 18th, 12:00 AM: Since the 15th, Chiang troops, under the cover of airplanes and artillery, have fiercely attacked Huaiyin city in two directions. The New Fourth Army's garrison troops have repeatedly repelled Chiang troops' assaults and inflicted heavy blows on them. As of the time of this dispatch, Huaiyin city is still firmly defended by the New Fourth Army. Fierce battles are ongoing in the outer defensive positions of the suburbs. A report on the combat situation in the past few days is as follows: On the afternoon of the 15th, the right-wing Chiang army's 74th Division (military reorganization) 58th Brigade (division reorganization), between Matou (18 miles west of Huaiyin) and Yangzhuang (26 miles west of Huaiyin), and the 51st Brigade (division reorganization) of the same division, along the Zhangchenji-Yaojia Ferry line, 30 miles southwest of Huaiyin, acted in coordination, forcibly crossing the Grand Canal under the cover of airplanes and artillery. The New Fourth Army rose up in resistance and engaged in fierce fighting all night, inflicting heavy damage on the invading Chiang troops, capturing eight light machine guns and dozens of prisoners. The Chiang troops' offensive was temporarily halted. On the 16th, Chiang troops sent reinforcements to launch fierce attacks on the New Fourth Army's positions at Shiyitou, Wujiadun, Qilidun, east of Zhangchenji-Matou, and Huzhuang, east of Yangzhuang. Another day of fierce fighting ensued. After inflicting heavy losses on the Chiang troops, the New Fourth Army withdrew to the line of Gaoxing Bridge, the old city of Hanxin, and the outskirts of the airport, west of Huaiyin city, on the same day. On the 17th, the Chiang troops launched seven assaults on all fronts, but were all bravely repelled by the New Fourth Army. On the morning of the 18th, the Chiang troops' attack was again repelled, and Chiang troops suffered extremely heavy casualties. The left-wing Chiang army's 7th Division (military reorganization) occupied Zhongxingji (east bank of the Grand Canal, northwest of Huaiyin) on the 14th. By the evening of the 15th, a detachment advanced south to Yugou (30 miles northwest of Huaiyin). The New Fourth Army launched a mobile counterattack, annihilating one company of invading Chiang troops, and halting the Chiang troops at the line of Dahu Village, west of Yugou. In recent days, Chiang planes have indiscriminately bombed Huaiyin city and peaceful villages and towns in the rear. On the 16th, they bombed Xiang Hexibao, damaging the dam about eight li west of Qingjiang City, flooding many nearby villages. At noon on the 17th, the New Fourth Army shot down one Chiang plane south of Huaiyin city, and another one northwest of the city in the afternoon, greatly delighting the people.

　　淮阴城郊发生激战进犯蒋军死伤累累
    我击落美式蒋机两架
    【新华社淮阴十九日上午一时急电】截至发电时止，淮阴城仍在新四军坚守中，城郊继续激战，进犯蒋军伤亡累累，中央社报导蒋军已于十七日攻陷淮阴完全正确。
    【新华社淮阴前线十八日上午十二时电】蒋军十五日起在飞机大炮掩护下，分两路猛犯淮阴城，新四军守备部队迭次击退蒋军冲锋并屡予蒋军重创，迄发电时止，淮阴城仍在新四军坚守中，激战正在城郊外围阵地对峙。数日战况报导如下：十五日下午进犯两淮之右翼蒋军七十四师（军改）五十八旅（师改），在码头（淮阴西十八里）、杨庄（淮阴西二十六里）之间，该师五十一旅（师改）在淮阴西南三十里之张陈集耀家渡一线配合行动，在飞机大炮掩护下，强行渡过运河，新四军奋起抵抗，彻夜激战，重创进犯蒋军，缴获轻机枪八挺，俘虏数十名，蒋军攻势暂遏。十六日，蒋军增援向张陈集码头东之石乙头、武家墩、七里墩及杨庄东之胡庄等处新四军阵地猛攻，又激战终日，新四军大量消耗蒋军后于是日撤至淮阴城西之高兴桥、韩信旧城及机场外围一线。十七日蒋军在各线七次冲锋均为新四军奋勇击退。十八日上午蒋军进攻仍被击退，蒋军伤亡极重。左翼蒋军第七师（军改）于十四日侵占众兴集（淮阴西北运河东岸）后，至十五日晚以一股南犯渔沟（淮阴西北三十里），新四军机动出击，歼灭进犯蒋军一个连，阻止蒋军于渔沟以西大胡庄一线。连日来蒋机滥炸淮阴城及后方和平村镇，十六日轰炸乡河西堡，将清江市西八里许之大堤炸中，水淹附近许多乡村。十七日中午新四军在淮阴城南击落蒋机一架，下午又在西北击落一架，人心大快。
