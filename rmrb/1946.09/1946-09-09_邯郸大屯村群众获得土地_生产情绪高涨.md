　　The masses in Datun Village, Handan, Obtain Land
    Production Enthusiasm Soars
    [This newspaper, Handan, 8th] Through the thorough rent reduction and liquidation movement, Datun Village in the south of this city has initially realized "the tiller owns his land," eliminating the extremely poor and poor peasants, who accounted for one-third of the entire village (totaling 151 households). Eighty-nine peasant households have each recovered two to three mu of land. In the past, the masses in this village suffered from heavy exploitation and oppression by the enemy, puppets, local bullies, and feudal landlords, languishing on the brink of death, resulting in barren land with weeds taller than seedlings and a sharp decline in production. Now that the peasants have become the masters of the land, their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The author inspected the fields of the village and witnessed the soft yellow soil between the verdant field ridges, with all weeds removed. According to old peasants, this kind of scene was unprecedented in the past. Recently, with the rain, the masses are taking the opportunity to cut artemisia to make fertilizer and prepare for sowing winter wheat. The masses naturally formed mutual aid groups in production and launched competitions. In half a month, Wang Richang and eight others alone cut more than 20,000 jin of artemisia and green grass. The songs of liberation, composed and sung by the masses themselves, are overflowing in the wilderness along the Fuyang River.

　　邯郸大屯村群众获得土地
    生产情绪高涨
    【本报邯郸八日讯】本市南大屯村经过深入的减租清算运动，已初步实现“耕者有其田”，消灭了占全村（共一百五十一户）三分之一户的赤贫和贫农，八十九户农民每人收回土地二亩至三亩。该村群众过去受敌、伪、恶霸及封建地主的重重剥削压榨，呻吟于死亡线上，以致土地荒芜，草比苗高，产量锐减；现农民成为土地的主人，生产情绪大为提高。笔者巡视该村田地，目睹青葱的田垅间黄土松软，杂草全被铲除，据老农称：此种景象为过去所未有。近日天雨，群众趁机割蒿沤粪并作播种秋麦准备。群众在生产中自然结成互助小组，展开竞赛，半月中，仅王日昌等九人即割蒿子和青草两万余斤。群众自编自唱，翻身歌曲洋溢在滏阳河畔的原野中。
