[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi on the 27th] In order to strictly enforce the financial system, eliminate extravagance and waste, and consolidate the material foundation for long-term support of the self-defense war, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued a "Decision on Cleaning Up Finances and Rectifying the Financial System," stipulating that all localities must complete the inspection and cleanup work within September. The decision also pointed out that the district's financial work has had a policy of unified planning and unified expenditure since the Anti-Japanese War, as well as a complete set of excellent systems and a frugal work style. Since the counter-offensive, the area has expanded and the needs have been enormous. Some comrades believe that the Anti-Japanese War has been won and that the requirements for life have increased, resulting in extravagance, waste, and chaos. If this is not stopped immediately, it will be severely punished. The purpose of our cleanup is to thoroughly clean up property and bring financial management into order, so as to guarantee military needs and people's food. Specific measures: 1. Responsible comrades should fully mobilize the cadres to make them deeply understand the current serious situation of the struggle against the stubborn elements. The army is shedding blood and sacrificing at the front. If the rear neglects self-examination and there are still a few cases of corruption, it will definitely affect unity and greatly weaken our front against the stubborn elements. Secondly, the burden on the masses is already heavy. If we save a point, we can ask the masses for one less point. Only by strengthening the mass concept, always thinking about the masses, and using all means to cultivate the people's strength can we persist in the protracted struggle. 2. Clean up warehouses. Except for border areas, food should be appropriately centralized. Border food and local food should be strictly separated, and old food should be disposed of quickly. Raw gold and silver should not be kept in the counties, but should be collected and stored in the special commissioner's office and the administrative office, and repaid on time or in installments. Grain and funds exchanged between superiors and subordinates and organs should be settled, and the materials in hand should be concentrated in the storage location designated by the special commissioner's office, and the income and expenditure should be cleared. Public grain and public funds should be classified and registered, and auctioned or retained separately. 3. Except for the troops, the confiscated properties of traitors and puppets, raw gold and silver, securities, various currencies, vehicles, livestock, large quantities of cotton cloth, and important properties confiscated by local organs should be uniformly managed by the government finance department. If they have been disposed of by themselves, they should report in detail to the governments at all levels or directly affiliated superiors. Daily necessities and organs that are necessary but not large-scale resources should only be registered and retained by the organs. Those taken by individuals, if they are necessary for themselves and not large in quantity, should still belong to the individuals and need not be investigated (such as shoes, etc.). Those that are not necessary or are large in quantity or large in value should be returned to the public. All kinds of fines must be handed over to the public in full, and no points are allowed to be retained. This kind of financial resources must be seriously investigated. 4. Those who discover enemy and puppet buried materials and those buried by our organs and cadres will be given appropriate rewards. Those who report will be rewarded; those who do not report will be given to the discoverer, and the rest will be returned to the financial department. The management organs or individuals who hand over the materials they have stored that should be returned to the public may be given a part according to the actual situation of the organs to solve their difficulties. 5. Grain and funds that have been misappropriated and used must be cleaned up within a time limit, and the treasury and warehouse system must be strictly enforced in the future. No expenditure shall be made without formal procedures. Leading comrades at all levels must be personally responsible and organize key inspections. For serious areas, a strong inspection team should be organized, led by responsible comrades. In the inspection and cleanup, the cadres' consciousness should be promoted, and comrades who are honest, selfless, and adhere to the system should be commended and rewarded. Those comrades who have violated the system should focus on educating them to correct their mistakes and be able to adhere to the system and abide by the system in the future arduous struggle environment. Those who do not change after being warned will be given due punishment. The purpose is to improve the current financial system, reiterate the seriousness of our system and discipline.

　　太行行署颁发清理与整顿财政制度决定
    肃清铺张浪费现象长期支援自卫战争
    【本报长治二十七日电】为严整财政制度，肃清铺张浪费现象，以巩固长期支持自卫战争的物质基础，太行行署特颁发“清理财政与整顿财政制度”的决定，规定各地须于九月内完成检查清理工作。该决定并指出：本区财政工作抗战以来即有统筹统支的政策，整套优良的制度与节约作风。反攻以来，地区扩大，需用浩繁。某些同志以为抗日胜利，生活要求提高，以致产生铺张浪费与混乱现象。如不即时制止，将受到严重惩罚。我们清理的目的，在于彻底清理财产，使财政管理纳入正规，以保证军需民食。具体办法：一、负责同志应在干部中充分动员，使干部深刻了解目前对顽斗争的严重形势。军队前面流血牺牲，如果后面疏于自检，再有少数贪污现象，一定会影响团结，并大大削弱我们对顽斗争的阵线。其次群众负担已经不轻，我们节省一分就可向群众少要一分。唯有加强群众观念，时刻为群众打算，用一切办法培养民力，才能坚持持久的斗争。二、清理仓库，除边沿地带外，粮食均作适当集中。边粮地粮严格分开，陈旧粮食速作处理。生金银县不保存，全部集存专署行署，限期或分期还清。上下级与机关往来之粮款均需将帐结算，掌握之物资，集中专署指定之保存地点，并清理收支情况。公粮公款分类登记，分别拍卖或留用。三、除部队外，各地方机关没收之逆产及敌伪之财产、生金银、有价证券、各种货币、车辆、牲口、大宗之棉花布匹及重要财物，均需交政府财政部门统一管理。如已自行处理者，应分别向各级政府或直属上级详加报告。日常用具和机关必需而又非大宗之资财，只作登记，仍归本机关留用。个人所取用者，凡为本身必需而又数量不多者，仍归个人不必追究（如鞋等……）。非必需或数量较多或价值较大者，则应归公。各种罚款必需全数交公，分文不准留用。此类财资须认真清查。四、发现敌伪埋藏物资及我机关干部之埋伏者，给以适当的提奖。有报告人者，奖报告人；无报告人者，归发现人，其余部分悉数归财政部门。管理机关或个人将其所存而应归公之物资交出者，可按本机关实际情况发给一部以解决其困难。五、挪用动支之粮款，均应限期清理，并严格今后金库仓库制度。非有正式手续，不得支出。各级领导同志须亲自负责，并有重点的组织检查。对严重的地区应组织强有力的检查组，由负责同志带领检查。检查清理中，应发扬干部自觉性，对廉洁奉公坚守制度的同志予以表扬奖励。对某些破坏制度的同志应着重教育其改正，并能在今后艰苦斗争环境中坚持制度，遵守制度。经过告诫不改者，则必给予应有处分。目的在健全今后的各种现行财政制度，重申我们制度的严肃性及纪律性。
