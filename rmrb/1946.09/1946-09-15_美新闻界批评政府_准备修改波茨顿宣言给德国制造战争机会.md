Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: TASS reports: American radio commentators Steele and Kenton, along with afternoon newspaper reporter Bardovi, sharply criticized Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart. Steele pointed out that Byrnes' speech "received the support of the worst elements in Germany." He said: "The tone of Byrnes' speech was as if he were a candidate for President of Germany. We would be very interested to see how the Germans could not elect Mr. Byrnes to the position he desires! Byrnes' speech clearly indicates that the United States is preparing to revise the Potsdam Declaration, prepared to sacrifice the Soviet Union and Poland on the issue of Germany's eastern border, and greatly disappoint France's demands for a peace treaty with Germany." Steele pointed out that the current US policy toward Germany is to strengthen German big business interests, strengthen its control over German industry, and prevent any country from infringing on the assets of Nazi industrialists. Byrnes' talk of German unification is merely to bring the methods used in western Germany to the east, and the Soviet Union opposes this method. Kenton said that the United States' decision will once again give Germany the opportunity to create war. Bardovi said that Byrnes' speech was in a "pleading German tone and conducting anti-Soviet propaganda in Germany." The speech is nominally democratic, but in reality, it does not even measure up to the oldest democracy in Europe. It is the most pro-German speech made by any responsible American official in the past decade. The New York Post said that if the policy of eliminating Nazism is not strengthened, then the unification of Germany will precisely strengthen the kind of Germany we believe we should destroy.

    准备修改波茨顿宣言给德国制造战争机会
    【新华社延安十二日电】塔斯社报导：美国无线电评论员斯蒂尔与肯顿以及下午报访员巴多维，尖锐批评贝纳斯在斯图加特的演说。斯蒂尔指出贝氏演说“得到德国最坏分子的拥护。”他说：“贝氏演讲的声调，好像他是德国总统的候选人，我们很愿看到德国人如何能不选贝纳斯先生当他所希望的职务呢！贝氏演说，清楚的表示美国准备修改波茨顿宣言，对德国东部边界的问题，准备牺牲苏波并使法国对德和约的要求大失所望。”斯蒂尔指出美国目前对德政策，就是加强德国大商业利益，加强其对德工业的控制，并阻止任何国家侵犯纳粹工业家的资产。贝纳斯所说的德国统一化，不过只是将德国西部所使用的方法带到东部去，而苏联是反对这种方法的。肯顿说：美国的决定，将又给德国制造战争的机会。巴多维说，贝氏演说是在“恳求德国的声调并在德国进行反苏宣传。”该演说名义上是民主主义的，但实际上还够不上欧洲最旧的民主主义，这是十年来任何美国负责官员所作的最亲德的演讲。纽约邮报说，如不加强实行消除纳粹化的政策，则德国的统一，恰恰加强了我们认为要摧毁的那样的德国。
