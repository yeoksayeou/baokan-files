(Transmitted by this Newspaper, Handan, 27th) (Late Dispatch) The Taiyuan Executive Headquarters, in order to mediate the conflict within Shanxi Province, specially convened a meeting of both sides' commanders on August 10th. Our Generals Liu Bocheng, He Long, Nie Rongzhen, and others, adhering to the principle of not abandoning any opportunity to seek peace, sent Comrades Du Runsheng and Duan Tukai across the front line to attend as representatives in Taiyuan. However, the Kuomintang representative, Guo Zongfen, showed absolutely no intention of a ceasefire, deliberately delaying matters, and in the meeting, he preposterously stated: "The CCP detains postmen, so the government is launching an offensive to protect transportation." He intentionally evaded responsibility for Hu Zongnan's army entering southern Shanxi and launching an offensive against us, saying, "I have no right to interfere." Guo even made the unreasonable demand that the Datong area be included in the scope of mediation by this group. Datong has its own independent group, which originally did not fall within the scope of the Taiyuan group's mediation. Our representative immediately refuted him according to reason, but the Kuomintang side refused to negotiate the issue of a truce. Our representative then solemnly pointed out: Since mid-May, the joint forces of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in Shanxi Province have launched offensives against us, and Yan Xishan has used a large number of Japanese puppet troops in combat, which is the fundamental reason for the conflict in Shanxi. If Yan Xishan does not stop his offensive for even a day, and Hu Zongnan's army does not withdraw from the areas it has invaded and occupied in southern Shanxi, then negotiations will be difficult, and the group's peace negotiations must include all areas under the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan group, without any exceptions. The Kuomintang's发言 (fāyán) remarks at the meeting clearly hindered the progress of the group's negotiations. At this time, the American representative also believed that the negotiation mediation should include Hu Zongnan's army, but should not overstep its authority to deal with the Datong group's affairs. However, the Kuomintang side did not accept this at all, resulting in no outcome from the group's negotiations.

　　蒋方毫无停战诚意
    太原谈判终无结果
    【本报邯郸二十七日电】（迟到）太原执行小组，为调停山西境内之冲突，特于八月十日召开双方指挥官会议，我刘伯承、贺龙、聂荣臻等将军本着不放弃任何机会以求得和平之本志，派杜润生与段土楷两同志通过火线，前赴太原代表出席。然国方代表郭宗汾，毫无任何停战表示，故意拖延，并在会议中狂谬谈称：“中共拘留邮差，政府为保护交通，故发动进攻。”彼对胡宗南军开入晋南向我发动进攻，则有意推脱责任谓：“我无权过问。”郭更提出必须将大同地区划归本小组调停范围的无理要求。大同有其另外独立的小组，原不属太原小组调处范围。我代表当即据理驳斥，国方竟拒绝谈判休战问题，我方代表乃严正指出：自五月中旬以来，山西境内蒋阎联军即向我发动进攻，阎锡山更大批使用日伪军作战，此乃山西冲突之基本原因。今日若阎锡山一日不停止进攻，胡宗南军一日不撤出侵占晋南之地区，则谈判实属困难，且小组和平谈判亦必须全部包括太原小组管辖范围，绝不能有所例外，国方在会议上之发言，显属阻碍小组谈判之进行。此时美方代表亦认为谈判调处应包括胡宗南军，但不应越权处理大同小组的问题。然国方对此，毫不接受，致小组谈判终无结果。
