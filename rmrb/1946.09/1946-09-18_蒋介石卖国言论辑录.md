Collection of Chiang Kai-shek's Treacherous Statements

　　On the night of September 18, 1931, the Japanese army attacked Shenyang. Chiang Kai-shek instructed the Northeast garrison "not to clash," saying: "This move by the Japanese army is nothing more than a routine provocation. In order to avoid escalating the incident, we must absolutely adhere to a policy of non-resistance." On September 23 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek stated in a speech at the Nanjing Municipal Party Congress: "At this moment, we must be united from top to bottom, using reason against power, and peace against barbarism, enduring humiliation and resentment, temporarily adopting an attitude of passively accepting things as they are, and awaiting the League of Nations' judgment based on justice." On March 10, 1933, when some officers and soldiers in Gubeikou and other places voluntarily requested to fight against the Japanese, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order: "Those who speak of resisting Japan shall be killed without pardon."

　　On April 7 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek said to the Central Route Army in Fuzhou, Jiangxi: "Our revolutionary enemy is not the Japanese invaders but the bandits. We should be responsible for the loss of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe (naturally lost under the so-called unified government), but from the standpoint of revolution, it doesn't matter much. The loss of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe by Japan this time is not the responsibility of the revolutionaries (referring to the Kuomintang), and the loss does not mean any loss to the revolution."

　　On April 10 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek summoned generals in Nanchang and instructed them: "Before the bandits are completely suppressed, we must absolutely not speak of resisting Japan, and those who violate this will be severely punished." In July 1934, Chiang Kai-shek said at the Lushan Military Officers Training Corps: The Japanese invaders "only need to issue an order, really only three days, to completely occupy the vital areas of our China and destroy our China." And said: "What methods do we have to resist the enemy and revive the nation? Is it possible to prepare for national defense with all our strength at this time, desperately manufacturing airplanes and cannons, and then fight them? All of you generals must also know that it is not only that we are now too late to temporarily purchase weapons and rectify national defense to resist them, but even if we all unite and devote ourselves to this effort for thirty years from now, it will still not be enough. So what methods do we have to rectify national defense, to really fight against Chiang? There is no such time, no such possibility, we should not dream. Now the entire life of our country, the life of the nation, can be said to be in the hands of the Japanese, and there is no way to move freely." On February 1, 1935, Chiang Kai-shek made a statement on "Sino-Japanese Friendship," saying: "We believe that the speech made by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota in his parliament regarding our country is also sincere, and our country should have a deep understanding of this... Our compatriots should use a dignified attitude to guide with reason and morality, and restrain temporary impulses and anti-Japanese behavior to show good faith." On September 10 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek published an article entitled "The Return of Sino-Japanese Relations" in the Japanese magazine "Economic Exchange," in which he said: "No matter from which aspect we look at it, China and Japan should cooperate and work together to promote the prosperity of Asia. Although we are in serious difficulties today, we take into account the long history of Sino-Japanese relations in the past and firmly believe that the disputes that have occurred today must be resolved through the sincerity and efforts of the people of both countries, to realize the true cooperation and friendship between China and Japan that I have always dreamed of." He also said: "The basic outcome of China's foreign policy can be summarized in the word 'peace.'... Under the grand ideal of peace in East Asia, it is not necessarily impossible to consider Japan's interests and make appropriate compromises and concessions."

　　On November 18, 1939, Chiang Kai-shek said at the Sixth Meeting of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang: "What exactly does it mean to fight the war to the end? As explained at the Fifth Plenary Session, to fight the war to the end is to restore the original state before the July 7th Incident, which is based on China as the benchmark." (According to his meaning, the entire Northeast, Chahar North, and the vast territory of eastern Hebei can be ceded to Japan and do not need to be recovered.)

　　蒋介石卖国言论辑录
    民国二十年九月十八日夜，日军进袭沈阳，蒋介石指示东北驻军“不许冲突”谓：“日军此举不过寻常挑衅性质，为免事件扩大，绝对抱不抵抗主义。”同年同月二十三日，蒋介石在南京市党员大会演讲谓：“此刻必须上下一致，先以公理对强权，以和平对野蛮，忍辱含愤，暂取逆来顺受态度，以待国联公理之判决。”民国二十二年三月十日，古北口等地军队中有将士自动请求抗日者，蒋介石下令云：“凡言抗日者杀勿赦。”
    同年四月七日，蒋介石在江西抚州对中路军训话谓：“我们革命的敌人不是倭寇而是土匪，东三省热河失掉了（自然在号称统一的政府之下失掉），我们应该要负责任，不过我们站在革命的立场说，却没有多大关系。这回日本占领东三省热河，革命党（指国民党）是不能负责的，失掉了是与革命无所损失的。”
    同年同月十日，蒋介石在南昌召集将领训话说：“在匪未剿清之前，绝对不能言抗日，违者即予最严厉处理。”民国二十三年七月，蒋介石在庐山军官训练团说：日寇“只要发一个号令，真是只要三天之内，就完全可以把我们中国要害之区都占领下来，灭亡我们中国。”并谓：“我们有什么方法来抵抗敌人复兴民族呢？是否现在这时候竭全力来准备国防，拚命的来制造飞机大炮，就可以和他来作战呢？各位将领一定也知道，不仅是我们现在临时购置武器整顿国防已来不及，不能和他抵抗，就是从现在起大家同心一致，专在这一方面努力三十年，还是不够。如此我们有什么方法可以来整顿国防，可以来和蒋真正作战？没有这个时候，没有这个可能，我们不要梦想。现在我们整个国家的生命，民族的生命，可以说都在日本人的掌握之中，没有方法可以自由活动一点。”民国二十四年二月一日，蒋介石对“中日亲善”发表谈话称：“此次日本广田外相在其议会所发表对我国之演辞，吾人认为亦具诚意，吾国朝野对此当有深刻之谅解……我国同胞当以堂堂正正之态度，为理智道义之指示，制裁一时冲动及反日行为以示信谊。”同年九月十日，蒋介石在日本的杂志《经济往来》上发表一篇《中日关系的转回》，他说：“中日两国无论自那一方面看，都应该提携协办，以图亚细亚的繁荣。今日虽在严重的困难之中，我们顾念中日关系在过去的悠久历史，确信今日所发生的纠纷，结局必须依两国国民的诚意与努力而获解决，实现我所不断理想的中日间的真正提携亲善。”又谓：“中国外交政策的基本结局，可以‘和平’两字尽之。…………在东亚和平的大理想之下，考虑日本的利益作相当的妥协让步，不一定不可能。”
    民国二十八年十一月十八日，蒋介石在国民党五届六中全会第六次会议上说：“所谓抗战到底究竟是怎么讲呢？和在五中全会说明抗战到底，要恢复七七事变以前的原状，是根据以中国为基准的说法。”（按他的意思是说，整个东北察北和冀东的广大领土都可划归日本不须收复了。）
