　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 6th: The Jidong Military Region recently released a communiqué on the Defense of Xianghe, stating: The Eighth Route Army on the Xianghe front, with the enthusiastic assistance of the local masses, has successfully defended the natural barrier of the Baihe River since August 2nd. Over the past month, it has continuously repelled more than 40 large and small attacks by Chiang's troops, killing and wounding over 100 Chiang troops and capturing 25 alive. We seized 19 American-style light and heavy machine guns, one 60mm mortar, three submachine guns, 32 rifles, and other military supplies. After suffering such serious losses, Chiang's troops carried out adjustments and replenishment during the temporary ceasefire of the 25th Executive Group's mediation. Starting on the 4th of this month, two regiments of Chiang's 142nd Division, one regiment of the 56th Division, and two regiments of puppet troops launched another attack. After killing and wounding over 1,300 of them, the Eighth Route Army, in order to conduct mobile warfare and more effectively strike the invaders, has withdrawn from Xianghe County.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 9th: A company and the heavy machine gun platoon of the Second Company of the 363rd Regiment of the 121st Division of Chiang's 94th Army were completely annihilated on the 5th while invading Qishuzhuang. In addition to killing and wounding 52 Chiang troops, the Eighth Route Army captured 84 officers and soldiers, including a deputy battalion commander, seized 6 American-style light and heavy machine guns, two 60mm mortars, and some guns, equipment, ammunition, etc. Upon hearing the news, Chiang's troops in villages near Qishuzhuang, such as Lugezhuang and Dongweizhuang, fled in panic. After Chiang's security regiment of Luan County, consisting of more than 150 people, occupied Zhanggezhuang, Zhuwangzhuang, and other places, they also fled back to Luan County on the afternoon of the 4th under constant attacks by the local army and people. When the security regiment passed Gumacun, 16 li west of the suburbs, they were ambushed by the local armed forces, resulting in over 60 Chiang troops killed or wounded, and the seizure of one American-style mortar, over 10 rifles, and some ammunition.
　　This newspaper, Yangcheng, 7th: 阎 troops stationed in Shicun, Xiangling, are deserting to the Liberated Areas in entire squads and platoons, carrying their weapons and requesting to return home. Of the 370 officers and soldiers of the First Battalion of the 215th Regiment of the 72nd Division, over 210 have recently fled, all in entire platoons. The Second Company of the battalion originally had 120 soldiers, but now only 38 remain. On the night of August 25th alone, an entire squad of 13 sentries deserted to our military defense area with their weapons. According to a logistics soldier from the regimental headquarters of the 72nd Division who deserted to our Liberated Area, the 阎 army soldiers all miss home and are unwilling to engage in civil war. Everyone wants to give their weapons to the Eighth Route Army and then request to return home. It is expected that around the Mid-Autumn Festival, a large number of soldiers will desert to escape from this bitter sea.
