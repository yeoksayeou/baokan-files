　　Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 6th: During the liquidation of landlords' illegal exploitation by the masses in the Fourth District of Jining in July, the determination of liquidation targets was based solely on the form of tenancy, which infringed upon the interests of some middle and rich peasants. Among the 48 households that were liquidated, only four were large landlords with particularly heavy exploitation, while middle and rich peasants accounted for 18 households. Three large landlords who should have been liquidated in the village were not. Furthermore, the compensation to each household after the liquidation completely violated the principle of taking care of hired and poor peasants. For example, the three hired peasant households that suffered the most exploitation received an average compensation of only 10.3 mu of land per household; 72 poor peasant households received an average of 23 mu of land per household; 69 middle peasant households received an average of 47 mu of land per household; 5 well-to-do middle peasant households received an average of 63 mu of land per household; and 5 rich peasant households received an average of 43 mu of land per household. The vast majority of peasants with no or little land in the village did not receive any compensation land. According to preliminary investigation, the reasons for the above deviations, in addition to the most important one of carrying out liquidation purely from the perspective of tenancy relations: Firstly, the cadres did not grasp the policies and did not conduct in-depth education and organization of the masses, resulting in the spontaneous development of mass liquidation. Secondly, there was a lack of careful investigation and research, and action was taken before the steps and plans were clearly defined. Thirdly, the liquidation method did not focus on investigating concealed land and liquidating the burdens transferred from large landlords to poor peasants and hired laborers, but excessively emphasized reducing "profit-sharing" land rent and withdrawing overcharged rent. In fact, in the Suiyuan-Mongolia region, it was a portion of middle peasants who cultivated "profit-sharing" land (poor peasants and hired laborers mostly did not have cattle and could not cultivate), so only middle peasants received compensation, and poor peasants and hired laborers did not receive land. Now, the leadership is correcting this deviation, and the land of the middle peasants that was liquidated is immediately returned to the original owners, and appropriate supplements are also made for the significant harm to the interests of the rich peasants.

    清算各种封建剥削全体农民才能翻身
    【新华社集宁六日电】集宁四区群众于七月清算地主非法剥削中，因单纯以租佃形式确定清算对象，以致侵犯了部分中富农利益。在被清算的四十八家中，剥削特重的大地主只有四户，而中富农即占十八户，该村另有三家应该清算的大地主则未清算，清算后对各户的赔偿，又完全违反照顾雇贫农的原则，如受剥削最重的三户雇农平均每户只得到赔偿土地十亩零三分，七十二户贫农平均每户得到赔偿地二十三亩，六十九户中农则平均每户得地四十七亩，五户富裕中农每户平均得地六十三亩，五户富农平均每户得地四十三亩，全村无地和少地的农民绝大部分未获得赔偿的土地。据初步检查形成上述偏向原因，除最主要的为单纯地从租佃关系上进行清算外。第一、干部没有掌握政策，没有深入教育组织群众，群众清算形成自流。第二、缺乏细密的调查研究，步骤和计划还未明确即行动起来。第三、清算方法上未着重查黑地及清算大地主移转于贫雇农身上的负担，而过分强调了减“分收”地租和退出多收租。事实上在绥蒙区种“分收”地的是一部分中农（贫雇农多无牛不能种），所以只是中农得到赔偿，贫雇农得不到土地。现领导上纠正这一偏向，被清算的中农土地立即退还原主，伤害富农利益重大的亦作适当的补充。
