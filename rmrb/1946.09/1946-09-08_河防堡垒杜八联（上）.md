　　River Defense Fortress Du Balian (Part 1)
    Xi Bingwu
    The Glorious History of the War of Resistance
    Du Balian was a joint defense unit in the seventh district of Jiyuan in the past. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party members and the people of Du Balian persisted in resisting Japan and created many heroic feats. In June 1942, the Third Battalion of the Ninth Army of the Kuomintang, in collusion with the Japanese invaders, betrayed the northern defense line of Du Balian, forcing the people of Du Balian to turn their anti-Japanese struggle from open to secret. In 1943, more than 180 soldiers who were forced to become puppet soldiers revolted. In 1944, Mr. Ma Mingshan led all the soldiers of the regiment to cooperate with the 58th Regiment to capture the Chenling stronghold and staged an uprising to join the Eighth Route Army. These facts are inseparable from the secret struggle of the people of Du Balian.
    Last August, when our army attacked Potou, the people of Du Balian, men, women, old and young, rushed to the front line. They used shoulders, hands, and embraces to transport hand grenades and shells to the front line, without baskets, using their own clothes to wrap them, so that the soldiers of the 17th Regiment never lacked ammunition in the fierce battle to attack Potou. With the help of the Eighth Route Army, the people of Du Balian finally liberated their hometown.
    The Fortress Stands Firm
    Although Du Balian was changed to ten administrative villages after liberation, the glorious name of "Du Balian" is still being called. Since last November, the broad masses of people have gradually begun to turn themselves over in the struggle against traitors and the liquidation of accounts. However, due to the Kuomintang's breach of faith and attack on our liberated areas, the people of Du Balian, under the traditional struggle and new awareness, quickly established their own armed forces - the militia. At the same time, they reorganized the self-defense forces and began to defend the Yellow River. At dawn on the second day after the armed organization was reorganized (January 14th), the Kuomintang's Ninetieth Army and the culprit who slaughtered the people of Du Balian, Wei Ansheng, violated the truce agreement and forcibly crossed the river and occupied the area east of Potou, seriously threatening the safety of Du Balian. The people of Du Balian all rushed to the front line to cooperate with the regular army to combat the Chiang Kai-shek troops who violated the agreement and invaded. In February, when the situation was relatively stable, they turned to the long-term struggle of blockading and harassing the stubborn puppets. At this time, Du Balian discovered special agent activities and the counterattack of the landlords. In addition, after a little respite, the Chiang army launched continuous attacks on Du Balian. Therefore, starting from March, villages such as Liuzhuang, Liandi, and Maoling further mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth anti-traitor and anti-hegemony liquidation, rent reduction and interest reduction, and anti-corruption struggles to raise the awareness of the masses. Furthermore, they carried out the anti-special agent struggle, and even further established a strong and strict intelligence joint defense, combat joint defense, established a mobile rotation team, built a ten-mile-long buckthorn blockade line combining stone mines and obstacles, and built small fortifications in key areas to carry out the explosion movement and launched a long-term and fierce battle for Jin Gao, Ma Dongbao with the stubborn army. The stubborn army launched more than 80 attacks on Du Balian from March to early May, the largest force reaching more than 300 people. In April alone, they attacked eight times in one week, with a total force of over 2,000, but they were all crushed by the people of Du Balian.
    Summer Harvest Defense War
    In May, when the summer harvest defense war began, the enemy used a large force to launch frontal attacks and side attacks in an attempt to make Du Balian submit. However, the people of Du Balian all enthusiastically participated in the wheat harvest struggle, truly achieving "harvest where it is ripe first," "cut quickly, thresh quickly, dry quickly, and hide quickly," and "fight in the front and dry and store in the back." When cutting, the headquarters put forward the slogan of "the rear supports the front," mobilizing a large number of children from the rear villages to help Liuzhuang and Mazhuang to rush to harvest and transport. They said: "The front is the same as our rear. Losing their grain is losing our grain." The militiamen in the front did not return day and night, closely monitoring the enemy. They harvested when the enemy did not come and fought when the enemy came. There were gunshots every day, and outside the buckthorn blockade, men, women, old and young carried out a general mobilization during the rush harvest. The old and weak went to the front to deliver food, and when they came back, they transported grain to the rear one by one. The children went to pick up wheat as soon as they put down the cans. No one paid attention to the stubborn army's bullets flying over their heads. People were so nervous that they just smiled and nodded when they met and walked away. In three days, the fields were empty, in eight days, the threshing grounds were empty, and in one day, the public grain was voluntarily and enthusiastically handed over. Immediately afterwards, the houses were cleared, and the grain was transported to the rear and hidden. The stubborn army's conspiracy to grab grain finally became a bubble.
    The Heroic Water Guerrilla Warfare
    In order to cooperate with our army's self-defense counterattack against the Kuomintang army in the Ji-Meng area in northern Henan in early August, the Jiyuan militia actively participated in the battle, and men, women, old and young in Du Balian all automatically took action. The men went to the front line, and the youth and women were in charge of sentry duty. The children were also busy delivering letters, running transportation, carrying stretchers, transporting ammunition, and delivering tea. People were vying to do it. A militiaman who was carrying a stretcher was injured, but he immediately asked his wife to carry it. Liandi mobilized 5,000 catties of wheat overnight because the troops' supplies could not keep up. People treated the wounded soldiers like they were taking care of their own children. On the first day of the war, the people followed the troops and continuously destroyed more than 50 bunkers. On the 4th, Du Balian organized a naval militia team, led by combat hero Xue xx, to intercept the stubborn army on the Yellow River. On the night of August 3rd, it was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. The naval militia of Du Balian launched an even more magical water guerrilla war. They coordinated the counterattack of the regular army and took on the task of intercepting the stubborn army behind enemy lines. Under the leadership of ××, more than 30 heroes with gourds on their chests, rifles on their shoulders, and hand grenades and machine guns all over their heads, floated up and down in the turbulent Yellow River, swimming towards Baipo Nanchen. When the frontal army had not yet arrived, they blew up the stubborn puppet ships and occupied the wharves of Nanchen and Baipo, intercepting the aid route of the puppet stubborn. When the frontal war began, they launched an attack. That night, there was thunder and lightning in the sky, and the ground was full of artillery fire and flying sparks. In the fierce battle, the stubborn army fled one after another. The director of the Public Security Bureau, the secretary of the stubborn county government, Li Huipu, and the secretary of Wei Ansheng, as well as ten soldiers, were all captured by the naval militia. On the 6th, in cooperation with the troops, the naval militia and the militia of the Fourth District forcibly attacked the small island in the Yellow River - Xitan. Led by heroes Xue ×× and ××, director of the Armed Forces Committee of the Seventh District, they forcibly attacked the "self-defense regiment" of the stubborn army in Xitan, and captured three more people, obtaining seven rifles, 4,000 catties of white flour, thousands of bullets, and more than a dozen shells. These two attacks by the naval militia greatly enhanced the prestige of the people's armed forces. The militia of Du Balian also captured dozens of special agents in various villages who relied on the stubborn army to sabotage our border area work. And they recovered Madong and Mafeng, which had been contested with the stubborn army for several months, while the stubborn army never stepped into Du Balian. Statistics show that from January to the present, they have crushed more than 130 large and small attacks by the stubborn army, killing and wounding nearly 100 stubborn puppets. We only suffered five casualties among the militiamen. The stubborn army never stepped into Du Balian. They defended the Yellow River defense line, and the stubborn army's conspiracies such as sneaking across the river, leaping forward, and encroaching were severely hit. Now Du Balian has become the guarantee of Jiyuan and the strong fortress of the border struggle in the Fourth Military District.

　　河防堡垒杜八联（上）
    席炳午
    光荣的抗战史
    杜八联是过去济源七区的一个联保，抗日期间，杜八联的共产党员与人民一起，坚持抗日，曾创造了不少英勇的战迹。四二年六月，国民党第九军三营，因与日寇勾结，而出卖了杜八联的北部防线，迫使杜八联人民的抗日斗争不得不由公开转入秘密。一九四三年，一百八十多个被迫当伪军的战士反正了，一九四四年，马明山先生又率全团战士，配合五十八团攻取陈岭据点，举行起义，参加了八路军。这些事实与杜八联人民的秘密斗争是分不开的。
    去年八月我军，攻击坡头时，杜八联人民，男女老幼争赴前线，他们用肩挑，用手提，用怀抱，没有筐子用自己的衣服包上手掷弹，炮弹，向前线输送，使十七团健儿在攻坡头的激战中，没有缺过弹药。杜八联人民终于在八路军的帮助下解放了自己的家乡。
    阵地屹立
    杜八联解放以后虽改为十个行政村，但“杜八联”这个光荣的名字，仍旧被人称呼着。从去年十一月起，广大人民逐渐在反奸清算斗争中开始翻身，但由于国民党背信弃义，向我解放区进攻，杜八联人民在传统的斗争和新的觉悟下，很快又建立了自己的武装——民兵。同时，整理了自卫队，开始防守黄河。在刚整理好武装组织的第二天拂晓（元月十四日），国民党九十军与残杀杜八联人民的罪魁卫安生，违背停战协定强行渡河、侵占我坡头以东地区，严重地威胁着杜八联的安全，杜八联人民一齐拥上前线，配合正规军打击违约进犯的蒋介石部队。二月里形势较稳定，他们便转入长期对顽伪封锁袭扰的斗争阶段，这个时候杜八联内部发现了特务活动，发现了地主的反攻，加以蒋军稍事喘息后，即向杜八联连续不断的进攻，于是从三月开始，留庄、连地、毛岭等村更进一步发动群众深入反奸霸清算、减租减息，反贪污等斗争，提高群众的觉悟。进而开展反特务斗争，更进而建立了强有力的严密的情报联防，战斗联防，建立了机动的轮战队，构筑石雷与障碍物结合的长达十里的圪针封锁线，并在重点构筑小型工事，开展爆炸运动与顽军展开长期的剧烈的金郜、马动保的争夺战。顽军从三月到五月初向杜八联进攻达八十余次之多、最大的兵力达三百多人，仅四月份一个礼拜即进攻八次，总兵力两千有零，但都被杜八联人民一一粉碎。
    夏收保卫战
    五月，夏收保卫战开始时，敌人以大的兵力采取正面进攻与侧面袭击，企图使杜八联屈服，然而杜八联人民都踊跃的投入麦收斗争，真正作到“那儿先熟，先收那儿”，“快割、快打、快晒、快藏”，“前边打仗后边晒藏”。割的时候指挥部提出：“后方支援前线”的口号，由后边村庄动员大批小孩子帮助留庄、马庄抢收抢运，他们说：“前边和咱后边一样，丢了他的粮，就是丢了咱的粮。”前边的民兵白天黑夜不回来，紧紧的监视着敌人，敌人不来就收割，敌人一来就打仗。这里每天都在响枪，在圪针封锁以外，抢收时候男女老少进行了总动员，老弱去到前边送饭，回来的时候还一零一零的向后运送粮食。小孩子送饭一放下罐子就去拾麦，顽军的子弹从头上飞过，也没有人理它，人们紧张到见面只一笑点点头就走过去了。三天时间地里光了，八天时间场里光了，一天时间自动踊跃的交了公粮，紧接着空室清野，把粮食都运往后方藏起来了。顽军抢粮的阴谋终于成为泡影。
    壮烈的水上游击战
    为了配合八月初豫北我军对济孟地区国民党军的自卫反击作战，济源民兵积极投入战斗，杜八联男女老少都自动的行动起来。男人们到火线上去，岗哨了望全由青年妇女们担任了，小孩们也忙着来往送信，跑交通、抬担架、运弹药、送茶水人们都抢着去做。有个抬担架的民兵负了伤，但他马上又叫他老婆去抬，连地因为部队给养接不上，一夜动员了五千斤麦，人们像看护自己的子弟一样，招待伤兵，战争的头一天，人民就和部队相随上，连续摧毁了五十多个碉堡，四号那天，杜八联组织了水手民兵队，由战斗英雄薛××率领，在黄河水上截击顽军，八月三日的夜里，天黑的伸手不见指，杜八联的水上民兵更展开了一幕神奇的水上游击战。他们策应正规军的反击，担任了深入顽后截击的任务。在××的领导下，三十多个胸前抱着葫芦，肩上荷着长枪，头上挂满了手榴弹机枪的英雄，在波浪滔天的黄河里一起一伏，向着白坡南陈游去，当正面的军队尚未到达时，他们炸沉了顽伪船只，占领了南陈、白坡的码头，截击了伪顽的援路。等到正面战争开始，他们便展开了袭击。这天夜里，天上雷雨交吼，电光闪闪，地上炮声隆隆，火光飞迸，在激烈的战斗中顽军纷纷逃窜，顽县府李惠浦的公安局长、书记和卫安生的书记以及十个战士都被水手民兵俘虏了。六号，配合部队，水手民兵又和四区民兵，强袭黄河中的小岛——西滩。由英雄薛××和七区武委会主任××领头，强袭西滩顽军“自卫团”，又俘掳三人，得七支步枪，白面四千斤，子弹数千发，炮弹十余颗。这两次水上民兵的出击，大大提高了人民武装的声威，杜八联的民兵，并在各村，捕获了数十个依靠顽军，破坏我边沿区工作的特务。并收复了与顽军争夺数月的马洞、马蜂，而顽军始终没有踏进杜八联一步。统计从元月至今粉碎顽军一百三十余次的大小进攻，毙伤顽伪近百，我只伤亡民兵五人，顽军始终没有踏进杜八联一只脚，他们保卫了黄河防线，使顽军特务的偷渡跃进，蚕食等阴谋进攻，受到严重的打击。现在杜八联成为济源的保障，四分区边沿斗争的强固堡垒了。
