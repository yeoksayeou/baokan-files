　　Finding Money and Not Pocketing It
    [News from Handan City] Li Xiude, a citizen of the city, and Zhang Lian, a bailiff of the Municipal Government, found 10,000 yuan of Hebei currency at the South Gate on August 12th. They immediately explained the matter to comrades in the Judicial Section and entrusted the Civil Education Center to write a statement on the blackboard on Heping Street, asking the person who lost the money to contact the Judicial Section. On September 5th, Comrade Lian Baotang, an accountant from the Military Region Clothing Factory, came to explain the process of losing the money and the number of bills, which completely matched the facts. Zhang Lian and Li Xiude then returned the entire 10,000 yuan they had found to him. Comrade Lian was very grateful.

　　拾金不昧
    【邯郸市讯】城内市民李修德与市政府法警张连两人，于八月十二日在南城门拾了一万元冀钞，他们当时就向司法科同志说明此事，托民教馆往和平大街黑板上写了个声明，叫失款人到司法科接谈，到九月五日，有军区被服厂会计连保堂同志，前来说明掉款经过，及票子张数后，完全符合实情，张连李修德遂将拾款一万元完全给了他，连同志非常感激。
