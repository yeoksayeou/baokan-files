　　Helping Spinning Women Improve Native Yarn
    Yihecheng Dyeing and Weaving Improves Quality
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 10th] Since the launch of the "May 1st" New Labor Movement in Changzhi City, the workers of Yihecheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory have resolved to compete with other factories in improving the quality of finished products.
    Originally, Yihecheng's finished products were well-known in Changzhi, but in order to improve, they first solicited opinions from institutions, businesses, and the masses, and everyone in the factory also launched research. The results of the solicitation and research were that the thread was a bit rough, and the socks had bumps and were not fine and strong enough. The workers felt that the thread came from the countryside, and improvements in dyeing and weaving alone would not work without improving the cotton yarn, so the first step was to help the spinning women spin better thread. The Yihecheng flower collection and exchange department in Huangnian cooperated with village cadres and women to discuss spinning the thread finer and more evenly, so that native yarn could replace foreign yarn. At first, their interest was not great, and as usual, they earned half a catty of flowers for spinning one catty. The proposal was that spinning one catty well could earn one catty of thread, and the quality would be democratically evaluated by the women. In this way, the women's enthusiasm was increased, and everyone learned from the good ones. The factory's production department also strengthened its technical guidance for them. Soon, the thread spun by the women became finer and more even.
    When the thread was brought to the factory, the workers, after repeated research, found that using old needles was not good, and new needles were needed. Finally, with the workers' efforts to improve, the finished products became finer, smoother, and stronger. The workers' production morale and confidence were thus further enhanced.
    After technical improvements and the successful trial production of new fabrics, various goods sold even faster. At the same time, the factory also launched a movement to train apprentices, increase machine operators, and implement day and night shifts to greatly increase production. For apprentices, the opportunity to practice on machines was increased, technical guidance was provided at any time, and the apprentices' enthusiasm for mastering technology was brought into play. On the other hand, the leaders patiently provided help. In this way, in less than a month, Yihecheng had more than thirty apprentices who could produce goods. The number of skilled workers weaving towels and socks increased, and the "people stop, machine does not stop" shift system was implemented. Each shift worked eight hours, and in addition to the prescribed time, those who were willing to add two or four hours could receive labor and capital dividends in addition to wages. Under these circumstances, the workers in the whole factory were very enthusiastic about production. The daily output of two vest machines quickly increased from ten dozens to more than sixteen dozens; the output of towels and socks from one machine increased from three dozens to four and a half dozens per day. The staff also participated in the work when they were free.
    Yihecheng adapted to the needs of the market by increasing new goods and improving the original finished products. At the beginning of July, when the accounts were settled, a total of more than 700,000 yuan was earned, and the workers received 15% of the profits – more than 115,000 yuan. At the settlement meeting, apprentices who loved and cared for the factory, helped each other, and actively increased production were rewarded, and masters who were willing to teach technology were also commended. From then on, everyone was even more excited and happy to carry out new production.

### 帮助纺妇改进土纱  义合成染织质量提高

　　帮助纺妇改进土纱
    义合成染织质量提高
    【本报长治十日电】长治市自“五一”新劳动运动展开后，义合成染织厂的职工们，决心要在提高质量成品上，与其他工厂竞赛。
    本来义合成的成品在长治是有名的，可是他们为求得改进，便先在机关商号和群众中征询意见，在厂内大家也展开研究。征询和研究的结果，是线有些粗，袜上有圪瘩还不够细致和结实。工友们感到线是农村来的，光有染织的改进，没有棉纱的提高是不行的，所以首先要从帮助纺妇纺好线着手。黄碾义合成的收换花部配合村干部和妇女讨论，把线纺细纺匀，使土纱代替洋纱。开始她们的兴趣不大，照例是纺一斤挣半斤花，从提出纺好的一斤可以挣一斤线，好坏由妇女民主评定。这样妇女的积极性提高了，大家都互相向好的学习，工厂生产部也加强对她们的技术指导。不久，妇女纺的线变得又细又匀。
    线拿到了工厂，工人们又经过多次研究，发觉用旧针不行，需要换新针，最后在工人努力改进下，成品变得又细致又光滑又结实了。工人的生产情绪和信心，因此更加提高。
    在技术改进、新的织品试验成功后，各种货物销售的更快。同时厂内又发动培养学徒，增加上机工人，实行昼夜分班，大量增产的运动，对学徒采取增加上机练习的机会，技术上随时加以指教，发挥学徒掌握技术的积极性；另一方面领导上则不厌其烦的进行帮助。这样不到一个月，义合成已有三十多个学徒可以做货了。织毛巾、袜子的技术工人增多，便实行了“人停机不停”的分班上工制。每班工作八小时，除规定时间外，愿再增加二或四小时的，除加工资外还可按劳资分红。全厂工人在这种情况下生产劲头很大。两个背心机每日出货由十打很快增至十六打多；毛巾袜子一个机由每日三打增至四打半。职员们有空也参加工作。
    义合成以增出新的货物，和改进原来的成品，适应了市场的需要。七月初结账时，共赚了七十多万，工人们分得了百分之十五的盈利——十一万五千多元。在结账会上，对爱护与关心工厂，及互助友爱积极增产的学徒们作了奖励，肯教授技术的师傅也得到了表扬，从此大家都更加兴奋愉快的进行新的生产。
