Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Sui Front, 14th: The Eighth Route Army annihilated more than 2,500 of Fu Zuoyi's main forces in the northwestern suburbs of Jining City. The main forces of Fu Zuoyi's 11th, 17th, and 31st Divisions, who were advancing east along the Ping-Sui Railway to attack Jining City, once again attempted to attack eastward from the Sancha Kou Wolong Mountain area in the northwestern suburbs of the city on the afternoon of the 11th, under the cover of American-made Jiang planes and the coercion of their "enforcement teams." The Eighth Route Army fought bravely to resist, charged into Fu's army's positions, and divided them into several sections. After fierce fighting until late at night, more than 2,500 of Fu's troops were annihilated, and the headquarters of their 17th Division was almost completely wiped out. The remnants of Fu's army fled west in a panic. At dawn the next day, they discovered that their retreat had been cut off by the Eighth Route Army, and they fought like trapped beasts, fleeing into Jining City. The Eighth Route Army is now tightening the encirclement of Fu's army from both inside and outside the city, and the battle is in full swing.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Zhangjiakou News: Fu Zuoyi launched a full-scale attack on Jining. According to preliminary statistics, one division and one regiment have been annihilated by the Eighth Route Army, accounting for more than one-sixth of Fu Zuoyi's total force and more than one-fifth of his total infantry. Fu Zuoyi has two armies and one cavalry division, a total of six divisions. On the front line of this campaign, the serial numbers of all of Fu's infantry divisions have appeared. The annihilated Fu troops were the Provisional 11th Division and the 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 17th Division, all of which belonged to Fu's main forces. After inflicting such heavy casualties on Fu's army, the Eighth Route Army has maneuvered and withdrawn from Jining, preparing to inflict even greater blows on Fu's army. The full results of the battle are still being tallied. Fu Zuoyi is willing to serve Chiang Kai-shek and does not hesitate to use the lives of his officers and soldiers as a bet, making a desperate all-out attack. His future can only be one of utter defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 13th: The spokesman of the Jinchaji Military Region told reporters in a relaxed tone about Fu Zuoyi's attack on Jining: "Fu Zuoyi set up a stage, waved the flag, and made a big show of sending troops, but it was just a military gamble. Some time ago, Fu Zuoyi sent a representative surnamed Zhou here. This person is still staying in the local hostel. It's like 'visiting diplomacy,' planning to negotiate on the one hand and attack on the other, learning the old tricks of the Japanese invaders; but it's too clumsy. We might as well tell him to be careful not to 'try to steal a chicken only to lose the bait'." The spokesman then reviewed the facts of Fu Zuoyi's previous attacks on the Jin-Cha-Sui Liberated Area, saying: "Fengzhen, Jining, and Gui Sui were all recovered by the Eighth Route Army when the Japanese invaders surrendered. Soon after, they were forcibly occupied by Fu's army, which continued to attack Chaigoubu, the gateway to Zhangjiakou. We retreated to Chaigoubu before giving him a taste of his own medicine and sending him back to Suiyuan. After the ceasefire order was issued, we always held our defensive areas and insisted on peace, but Fu's troops insisted on seizing 'strategic points' and continued to attack Taolin, Jining, Fengzhen, Liangcheng, and Zhuozishan. Therefore, we had no choice but to give him another taste of his own medicine and defeat him. Fu Zuoyi should learn something from these two encounters!" The spokesman finally said: The Kuomintang's Tianjin Radio said that Fu's army had occupied Jining and continued to attack Fengzhen. This is just their own wishful thinking. As for what will actually happen, the facts will soon give a resounding answer.

　　集宁西北我军英勇自卫
    歼灭傅军二千五百人
    残部后路被截狼奔豕突我正紧缩包围
    【新华社绥东前线十四日电】八路军在集宁城西北郊歼灭傅作义军主力两千五百余人。沿平绥路东犯集宁城之傅军十一、十七、三十一师等部主力于十一日下午在美制蒋机掩护及其“执法队”驱策下，由城郊西北三岔口卧龙山一带再度向东窜犯，八路军奋勇阻击，冲入傅军阵地，将其割裂为数段，激战至深夜，歼灭傅军两千五百人以上，其十七师师部几遭全部覆没。傅军残部狼狈西溃，次日黎明发现其后路已被八路军切断，乃作困兽之斗，向集宁城内狼奔豕突，现八路军正由城内外紧缩对傅军的包围，战争正在剧烈进行中。
    【新华社延安十三日电】张家口消息：傅作义倾巢出犯集宁，据初步统计，已被八路军歼灭一个师一个团，占傅作义全部兵力六分之一以上，全部步兵五分之一以上。傅作义拥有两个军及一个骑兵师一共六个师，在这次战役的前线上，傅军所有步兵师的番号均已出现。在被歼灭的傅军为暂编第十一师及暂编第十七师之第三团，皆属于傅之主力部队。八路军在给予傅军以如次重大杀伤后，已机动撤离集宁，准备予傅军以更大打击，全部战果正在清查中。傅作义甘心为蒋介石效劳，不惜以其部下官兵之生命为赌本，孤注一掷倾窠出犯，其前途只有覆没之一途。
    【新华社张家口十三日电】晋察冀军区发言人顷就傅作义进攻集宁事以轻松语调告诉记者称：“傅作义搭起架子摇旗呐喊大举出兵，其实只是一个军事投机。前些时候，傅作义曾经派了一个姓周的代表来，此人现在仍住此间旅舍，那就像个“来栖外交”，打算一面谈判一面进攻，学习日寇故技；但未免太拙，我们无妨告诉他要谨防“偷鸡不得倒蚀一把米”。发言人继回溯傅作义历次进攻晋察绥解放区之事实称：“丰镇、集宁、归绥在日寇投降时均为八路军所收复，不久即为傅军强占，并一直攻击到张家口的门户柴沟堡来，我们是退到柴沟堡才回敬他一手，把他送回绥远。停战令下达，我们始终固守防区坚持和平，但傅部却偏偏又要夺取“战略要点”，继续向陶林、集宁、丰镇、凉城、卓资山等地进攻，于是我们不能不再回敬一手，将其击退。傅作义应该从这两次交手中学到些东西才好！”发言人最后称：国民党天津广播说傅军已占集宁续向丰镇进攻，这只是他们自己的一向心愿而已，究竟怎样，事实会很快给予响亮的答复。
