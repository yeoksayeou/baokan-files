[Heze Dispatch, September 8th] Military News: Eleven brigades (formerly divisions) of the Chiang Army in the central section of the Longhai Railway, personally deployed and commanded by Chen Cheng, Liu Zhi, and Fan Hanjie, invaded Heze, the central area of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Our army, filled with grief and indignation, fought back valiantly for three days and three nights, completely annihilating four invading Chiang Army brigades (formerly divisions): the 20th Brigade and 3rd Brigade of the Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army), the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division, and the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division (all formerly armies and divisions). Third Division Commander Zhao Xitian (formerly Tenth Army Commander) and all personnel of his division headquarters' eight departments were captured. Currently, another brigade of the 47th Division—the 125th Brigade—is heavily besieged and suffering significant losses. Our army has also seized the opportunity to recover Dongming County, which was once occupied by the invading Chiang Army. The Chiang Army along the entire Longhai front is now in full retreat.

[Heze Dispatch, September 7th] The Chiang Army, advancing from six routes—Changyuan, Kaocheng, Lanfeng, Minquan, Dangshan, and Xuzhou—to invade our Hebei-Shandong-Henan central areas of Dingtao and Heze, has been bravely resisted and completely repelled by our local Eighth Route Army and mass armed forces. The 20th Brigade (formerly division) of the Third Division (formerly Tenth Army) was completely annihilated during the invasion. Originally, there were seven Chiang Army corps (now divisions) along the central section of the Longhai Railway. Later, to launch a large-scale invasion of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, six more corps (now divisions), totaling 350,000 men, were transferred from Henan, Shaanxi, and Anhui. After deployments were completed, they began their invasion in late last month, immediately capturing the counties of Lanfeng and Dangshan, as well as the railway stations of Yejigang and Liuheji. The Chiang Army's East Route forces—the 88th Division, 18th Division, and 5th Division (formerly corps)—further attacked in separate routes from Xuzhou, Dangshan, and Mamuji, successively capturing Peixian, Fengxian, Yucheng, and Shanxian. They then launched a large-scale invasion towards our northwest areas of Chengwu and Dingtao. Simultaneously, the West Route Chiang Army forces—the 41st Division, Third Division, 47th Division, 55th Division, and 68th Division (all formerly armies)—moved out from Changyuan, Kaocheng, Lanfeng, Minquan, and other places, immediately invading Wanglou (south of Caoxian), Lvyuanzi (between Kaocheng and Caoxian), Baimaoji (southwest of Heze), and other places. Although a part of the Third Division was annihilated at Baimaoji, the invading Chiang Army forces continued to advance towards our Caoxian, Dingtao, and Heze. Our army calmly responded, waiting for them to penetrate deeply, and then launched a swift and decisive large-scale counterattack. In three days, they completely surrounded the Third Division, which had wedged sixty li southwest of Heze, and on the fifth day, they completely annihilated its 20th Brigade. After suffering significant losses, the other invading forces fled in panic. Our army and militia are seizing the opportunity to pursue and annihilate them, continuing to expand the victory. The Third Division, formerly known as the Tenth Army, was a direct line force of Chiang Kai-shek that had suppressed the Communists for many years. It was transferred from southern Shaanxi to the Longhai front before the civil war, and it comprised two brigades (formerly divisions). The 20th Brigade, which was completely wiped out in this battle, was one of them.

[Heze Dispatch, September 8th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Eighth Route Army is seizing the opportunity to annihilate the invading forces' active strength. Following the annihilation of the invading Chiang Army's 20th Brigade of the Third Division on the fifth day, on the sixth day, it completely annihilated the Third Division (formerly Tenth Army) headquarters and its 3rd Brigade (formerly division), which had been pursued and surrounded at Zhouji, Dahuangji, and Dalizhai southwest of Heze. The remnants attempting to escape were also eliminated by our pursuing troops that afternoon. Third Division Commander Zhao Xitian, all personnel of the division headquarters' eight departments, and brigade and regimental officers and soldiers, aside from suffering pointless sacrifices, all laid down their weapons. At the same time, on the evening of the sixth day, another counterattacking force of ours surrounded and annihilated the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division and the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division of the Chiang Army, which had fled to the Taoyuanji area west of Zhouji. Our army also seized the opportunity to recover Dongming County, which was once occupied by the invading army. Currently, another brigade of the 47th Division—the 125th Brigade (all the above formerly armies renamed as divisions, divisions renamed as brigades)—which has fled to Baimaoji northwest of Caoxian, is under our heavy siege and is being continuously annihilated. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in the three days from the third to the sixth, our forces killed, wounded, or captured over 8,000 Chiang Army officers and soldiers below the division commander level, and seized over 100 light and heavy machine guns, six tanks, and six vehicles. At this point, the Chiang Kai-shek invading army has lost more than half its strength, becoming increasingly shaken and collapsing, and is being intercepted everywhere by the military and civilians of our Liberated Area, finding itself in a terrible state.

According to a Chiang Army officer who laid down his weapons: This large-scale Chiang Army invasion, in addition to being meticulously deployed by Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, also saw Kuomintang Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fan Hanjie and Zhengzhou Pacification Director Liu Zhi go to the front lines near Tianyemiao south of Heze and Lanfeng and Minquan to supervise the fighting and encourage morale, saying, "Liu Bocheng's small number of troops are making a desperate gamble and are no match for us." These words should rightly be placed on the heads of those traitorous warmongers and civil war experts. (Attached photo)

　　冀鲁豫军民自卫大捷
    蒋军四个旅全部就歼
    毙俘伤共八千生擒第三师师长赵锡田
    深入解放区蒋军全线狼狈溃退
    【本报荷泽八日电】军息：陇海中段蒋军十一个旅（原师改称），在陈诚、刘峙、范汉杰亲自布置指挥下，向我冀鲁豫中心荷泽进犯，我军悲愤自卫，经三日三夜勇猛反击后，已将进犯蒋军四个旅（原师改称）全部歼灭，计有第三师（原第十军改称）之二十旅与第三旅、四十七师一二七旅、四十一师一二二旅（均原军原师改称）。第三师师长赵锡田（即原第十军军长）及其师部八大处人员全部被俘。现四十七师另一个旅——一二五旅已陷入重围，遭受重大损伤，我军并乘胜恢复一度为进犯蒋军占领之东明县城。现陇海全线蒋军均纷纷溃退中。
    【本报荷泽七日电】自长垣、考城、兰封、民权、砀山、徐州六路进犯我冀鲁豫中心地区定陶、荷泽之蒋军，已被我当地八路军及群众武装奋勇抗击，完全击退。第三师（原第十军改称）之二十旅（原师改称）在进犯中为我全部歼灭。沿陇海中段原有蒋军七个军（现改师），后为大规模进犯我冀鲁豫解放区，复从豫、陕、皖增调六个军（现改师），三十五万人，经部署就绪后，上月下旬即开始进犯，当即陷我兰封、砀山县城及野鸡岗、柳河集等车站。东路蒋军八十八师、十八师、第五师（军改称）更分路自徐州、砀山、马牧集出犯，先后陷我沛县、丰县、虞城、单县，复大举向我西北城武、定陶地区进犯；西路蒋军四十一师、第三师、四十七师、五十五师、六十八师（均原军）同时分自长垣、考城、兰封、民权等地出动，当即侵陷我王楼（曹县南）、吕园子（考城曹县之间）、白茅集（荷泽西南）等地。第三师一部虽被歼于白茅集，但各路进犯蒋军仍步步向我曹县、定陶、荷泽逼进，我军沈着应战，待其深入，当即发动迅雷不及掩耳之大规模反击，三日即将其西路楔入我荷泽西南六十里之第三师团团包围，五日即将其二十旅全部歼灭，其他各路进犯军遭重大损伤后，纷纷狼狈溃窜，我军及民兵正乘胜追歼，继续扩大战果。按第三师原称第十军，为蒋介石嫡系部队剿共多年，由陕南调至陇海内战前线，共辖两个旅（原师改称），在此次全部复灭之二十旅即为其中之一。
    【本报荷泽八日电】冀鲁豫八路军乘胜歼灭各路进犯军有生力量，继五日歼灭进犯蒋军第三师二十旅后，六日复将被追击包围于荷泽西南之周集、大黄集、大李寨之第三师（原第十军改称）师部及其第三旅（原师改称）全部歼灭，企图逃窜之残部亦于当天下午为我追击部队所解决。师长赵锡田、师部八大处全体及旅长、团长官兵除遭无谓牺牲外，全部放下武器。同时，六日晚我另一路反击部队当将窜至周集以西桃源集一带地区之蒋军四十七师一二七旅、四十一师一二二旅包围歼灭后，我军并乘胜恢复一度为进犯军占领之东明县城。现窜至曹县西北白茅集四十七师另一个旅——一二五旅（以上均原军改称师，师称旅）已处于我重重包围下，正继续歼灭中。据极不完全统计，自三日至六日三天内，我毙伤俘进犯蒋军师长以下官兵八千余名，缴获轻重机枪一百余挺、坦克车六辆、汽车六部。至此，蒋介石进犯军已损失过半，益加动摇纷纷溃散，并到处遭我解放区军民拦击，狼狈不堪。
    据放下武器的蒋军某军官谈：此次蒋军大规模进犯，除经蒋介石参谋总长陈诚绞尽心血详密部署外，国民党陆军部副总司令范汉杰、郑州绥署主任刘峙并分赴荷泽以南天爷庙及兰封、民权一带前线督战，并鼓励士气说：“刘伯承少数部队孤注一掷，不堪一击。”而这些话恰恰在是应该带在卖国贼好战分子内战专家们的头上。（附图）
