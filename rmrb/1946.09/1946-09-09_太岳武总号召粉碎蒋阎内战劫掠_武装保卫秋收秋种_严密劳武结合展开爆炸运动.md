　　[This Dispatch from Yangcheng on the 6th] The Taiyue Military Commission convened on the 3rd and issued a proclamation calling on all district militiamen and self-defense forces to arm themselves to defend the autumn harvest and planting. The proclamation first pointed out: The traitorous national betrayers Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan are expanding the civil war in our Taiyue District and looting wildly. Therefore, we must urgently mobilize to fight to defend the autumn harvest and planting and oppose the reactionaries' plunder and destruction. The proclamation then pointed out: In order to successfully complete the autumn harvest and planting and enrich the material foundation for self-defense, we must carry out various armed struggles. First, improve the explosive joint defense. This is the most effective way to protect grain. When a village is threatened, all areas should rush to support it. In the joint defense, more explosives must be used. Only by planting a large number of landmines or stone mines can the power of militia joint defense operations be highly effective. Second, closely combine labor and military affairs: In areas along the border that may be threatened by invading troops, militias should be organized to serve as frontline guards. Militiamen who miss work due to war alert should be issued work points, which should be reasonably shared by the whole village. Third, widely carry out guerrilla warfare, and regularly send small, sharp, and capable militia guerrilla groups to areas occupied by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's troops to carry out activities, intercept and harass, disrupt transportation, contain the enemy, and provide good coordination for the frontline autumn harvest and planting work. Fourth, in areas that may be looted by invading troops, we should seriously and quickly harvest, quickly thresh, quickly dry, and quickly hide, carry out scorched earth tactics, disperse and bury supplies, and densely deploy stone mines to blockade. The proclamation finally pointed out that in the core areas, in addition to mobilizing all labor and animal power to intensify harvesting and planting, we should especially adhere to the overall spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family" and send militia rotation teams and assistance teams to cover the autumn harvest and planting in the border areas.

　　太岳武总号召粉碎蒋阎内战劫掠
    武装保卫秋收秋种
    严密劳武结合展开爆炸运动
    【本报阳城六日电】太岳武委总会于三日发表文告，号召全区民兵自卫队武装保卫秋收秋种。号召首先指出：汉奸卖国贼蒋介石、阎锡山正在我太岳区扩大内战，疯狂抢掠，因此我们必须紧急动员起来，为保卫秋收秋种。反对反动派掠夺破坏而斗争。号召继指出：为了胜利完成秋收秋种，充实自卫物质基础，必须进行各种武装斗争，第一、健全爆炸联防，这是护粮斗争中最有效的办法，一村遇警，各处驰援，在联防中必须多多使用爆炸，祗有大量的埋设地雷或石雷，才能高度发挥民兵联防作战的威力。第二、严密劳武结合：在边沿区可能受进犯军威胁地区，都应组织民兵担任前线警戒，民兵因战争警戒而误的工，应发给工票，由全村合理分担。第三、广泛开展游击战争，经常派遣短小精悍的民兵游击小组到蒋阎军侵占区去活动，截击袭扰，破坏交通运输，牵制敌人，给正面秋收秋种工作很好的配合。第四、凡可能受进犯军掠夺的地区，应认真快收、快打、快晒、快藏，进行空舍清野，分散埋藏物资，密布石雷封锁。号召最后指出腹心地区除动员全部劳力畜力加紧收种外，尤应本“天下农民是一家”的整体精神，派遣民兵轮战队、助收队掩护边沿区秋收秋种。
