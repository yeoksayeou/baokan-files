(Reported by our newspaper from Weixian on the 21st) All sectors of Jinnan are contributing all their strength to support the front. The Jinnan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's call to launch a campaign to donate money and goods to improve the lives of frontline soldiers has been met with enthusiastic response from all organs and schools. More than 20 directly affiliated units, including the Military Region Headquarters, Political Department, and Supply Department, donated 224,900 yuan, more than 100 pairs of shoes, more than 180 towels, and more than 150 comfort letters. Directly affiliated units of the District Committee donated 138,000 yuan. Many comrades enthusiastically went to the streets to buy toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, towels, cigarettes, and other items for the frontline soldiers, put them in handmade comfort bags, and embroidered beautiful patterns and words such as "Dedicated to the ever-victorious soldiers on the front line of the patriotic self-defense war" on the bags. At the donation meeting on the 18th, all employees of the Jinnan Bookstore enthusiastically donated 100,300 yuan and donated the three sheep produced by the organ to the frontline soldiers. Under the influence of leading cadres and party members donating money, the Jinnan Daily and the Jinnan Branch of the Xinhua News Agency donated more than 99,700 yuan in two days. In addition to donating 2,000 kilograms of saved rice to the frontline soldiers, the Federation of Trade Unions, Peasants' Associations, and Women's Federations enthusiastically embroidered comfort bags and bought soap, towels, and other items to donate to the frontline soldiers. The Military Affairs Committee called on militias in various places to actively join the army and participate in the war, and donated 18,000 yuan. The Jinnan Administrative Office, on the one hand, called on governments at all levels to examine their thinking, improve work efficiency, and solve all the difficulties of frontline soldiers and their families, and on the other hand, launched a campaign to donate money and goods. Director Meng took the lead in setting an example, donating his savings of 5,000 yuan to the front line. More than a dozen directly affiliated units of the Administrative Office responded one after another, donating 183,000 yuan in three days. Everyone also proposed to donate one or two liang of rice per person per day from September 1 to December 31. During this campaign to donate money and goods, many exemplary cadres and party members emerged from various organs. Cao Wenxian, Han Shuzeng, and other three comrades from the District Committee's breeding class donated 1,600 yuan they earned from buying medicine and selling salt, saying, "We would rather take less medicine than let the frontline soldiers suffer." Secretary-General Zhou and Deputy Secretary-General Ma, regardless of their own and their children's difficult lives, donated 12,000 yuan they had saved to the front line. Zhang Qinzong, a new soldier who had just arrived at the military region, was moved when he saw everyone donating money to the frontline soldiers, and donated the remaining 60 yuan in his pocket. After receiving the shoe fee, he donated another 200 yuan. Li Fengxiang, a young service member of the Solidarity Newspaper, donated his annual allowance. The soldiers of the guard battalion said, "We wear old clothes and old shoes in the rear and donate new ones for the front to wear." Zhao Xuesi, a young correspondent from the Administrative Office, donated 1,000 yuan used to make clothes. Wang Zehua, a young correspondent, was a child from an orphanage. When donating money, he took out 500 yuan. He said, "The Communist Party raised me from the age of nine!" In addition to donating 1,000 yuan, Comrade Song Huiwu also donated 20 kilograms of salary rice every month until the reactionary派 attack was repelled. The campaign to donate money and goods is still continuing enthusiastically in various parts of Jinnan.
