Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Moscow Dispatch: Every year in the Soviet Union, millions of working people go to the most beautiful scenic spots to rest and spend their holidays. Soviet people's sanatoriums have a history of twenty-five years. Previously, the best suburban villas and garden buildings belonging to nobles and capitalists have been transformed into rest homes for workers. Most of the coal miners in Donbass can go to the sanatoriums in the Crimean Peninsula's Tsarist palaces for rest. Sanatoriums are also located in the famous Caucasian mineral springs, the Ural forests, and the perpetually snowy coastal areas. Almost every trade union has a sanatorium, and there are also water sanatoriums, which are converted from ships and sail regularly on major rivers. Life on board is no different from other sanatoriums. This summer, no less than tens of thousands of people have rested in these water sanatoriums. Trade unions run as many as six hundred sanatoriums, housing nearly one and a half million people, twice as many as last year. The state has spent 8 billion rubles on the equipment and construction of sanatoriums. By 1950, three million people in the Soviet Union will spend their holidays in sanatoriums.

　　名胜区遍设疗养院
　　苏职工畅度假期
    【新华社延安二十五日电】莫斯科讯：苏联每年都有千万劳动人民跑到风景最美的地方去休养以度假日。苏联人民的疗养院已有二十五年的历史，以前属于贵族和资本家的最好的城郊别墅、花园建筑，都改成了劳动者的休养所。顿巴斯煤矿工人大部分都可跑到克里米亚半岛沙皇宫殿里的疗养所去休养。在高加索著名矿泉边、乌拉尔的森林中、终年积雪的临海区，都设有疗养院。几乎每一州都有职工会，并有水上疗养院，这是由轮船改装成的，定期在各大河流上航行，船上的生活和其他疗养院没有什么两样，今年夏天，在这种水上疗养院里休养的人不下数万人。职工会举办的疗养院达六百所之多，院内住着将近一百五十万人，比去年多二倍。国家为疗养院的设备和建筑所支出的费用达八十亿卢布，到一九五○年，苏联将有三百万人在疗养院里渡过他们的假期。
