Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th -- In recent months, self-criticism movements have successively unfolded in several county-level leading organs of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Since Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Region Government, and Xi Zhongxun, leader of the CCP Northwest Central Bureau, sent letters commending Zhidan County's production work last month, Mizhi has reviewed its lack of attention to production leadership, Gulin has examined its "providing umbrellas after the rain" work style, and Gan Quan and Yanchuan have used Zhidan's excellent work style as a model to examine their own work. Significant improvements have been made in the work style of leaders in various counties. In the first half of the year, Zhidan successfully completed its production tasks and laid a solid foundation for "exceeding any previous year" due to its serious study of instructions from higher authorities, its emphasis on and use of newspapers to promote work, its county-level leaders' diligence in going to the countryside, and its skillful use of exemplary methods to train cadres. After receiving the commendation letters, the county's Party and government cadres convened a meeting of county, district, and township cadres at the end of last month, focusing on reviewing shortcomings in their work. County Magistrate Zhao Yuwen frankly reviewed the lack of thoroughness in seed selection work, and Wang Zhongcheng, head of the county Party committee's organization department, reviewed his own bad habit of acting like a veteran. Other comrades also made frank and sincere self-criticisms. Wang Yaohua, the county secretary, pointed out in his work summary that while the correct policy of focusing on agriculture had been implemented in recent years, the development of other endeavors such as oxen and sheep had been neglected. At this conference, it was decided to immediately organize efforts to strengthen the autumn harvest, launch shock campaigns for wheat planting and large-scale autumn land reclamation, and to carry out a comprehensive ideological and work review of county, district, and township cadres in order to further improve work.

　　陕甘宁边区各县领导机关
    开展自我批评改进工作
    志丹全县干部进行思想与工作大检查
    【新华社延安十八日电】近月来自我批评运动已在陕甘宁边区几个县级领导机关中先后展开。自上月边府主席林伯渠，中共西北中央局领导人习仲勋，函奖志丹县生产工作后，米脂检讨了不重视生产领导，固临检查出“雨后送伞”作风，甘泉与延川并以志丹优良作风为借镜检查工作，对各县领导作风，均有很多改进。志丹上半年由于认真研究上级指示，并能重视、利用报纸推动工作，县级主要干部勤于下乡、且又善于利用典型示范方法来培养干部，致使该县生产顺利完成任务，并奠下“超过已往任何一年”的巩固基础。该县党政干部，接获奖函后，乃于上月底召开县、区、乡三级干部会，着重检讨工作缺点，县长赵玉文不隐讳地检讨了选种工作不深入，县委组织部长王忠诚检讨自己摆老资格等不良现象，其他同志都作了坦白诚恳的检讨。县书王耀华在总结工作中指出，这几年执行了以农业为主的正确方针，但放松了发展耕牛和羊子等其他工作。在这次大会上决定即时组织对加强秋收、变工突击种麦与大量开秋荒，并决定县、区、乡三级干部展开思想与工作的大检查，以便更加改进工作。
