Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 21st. Ms. Sui Lingbi, a senior Kuomintang member and advanced figure in women's circles in the Shandong Liberated Area, recently sent a telegram to Ms. Deng Yingchao of the Chinese Communist Party Delegation in Nanjing, forwarded to Madame Soong Ching Ling, stating: "I wholeheartedly endorse your statement, which represents the voice of true believers in the Three People's Principles and the aspirations of the people of the whole country. I firmly oppose the U.S. government's aid to Chiang with surplus materials, which expands the Chinese civil war and interferes in China's internal affairs. I urge you to appeal to women around the world to give strong support to the Chinese people and strive for the early realization of permanent peace in China and the world." Note: Ms. Sui served in the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters during the Northern Expedition. Dissatisfied with Chiang's autocracy and dictatorship, she left party affairs to engage in education.
