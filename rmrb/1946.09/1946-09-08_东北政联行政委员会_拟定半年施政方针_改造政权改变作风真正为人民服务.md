Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 4th. The Northeast Political Council Administrative Committee has formulated policy guidelines for the next six months, as decided at the Committee's second meeting on August 31st, and will issue a notice to all provinces for implementation in the coming days. The first provision of these policy guidelines is to transform the government, stipulating that in the next six months, the village government must be initially transformed, and the organizational structure and work style of district and township governments must become a government that truly serves the people. An administrative meeting of all provinces will be held next spring to summarize the work, and preparations will be made to convene a Northeast People's Representative Conference. To this end, it is necessary to implement the policy program so that farmers can obtain land. On the basis of distributing enemy and puppet land, the village government must be transformed, making the village government one with farmers as the backbone. One of the main tasks of the current Civil Affairs Committee is to formulate and promulgate land regulations. The transformation of upper-level governments such as counties and cities will be carried out through rotational training and streamlining administration to change the old work style. In terms of finance, all provinces must achieve unified planning and expenditure and unified fiscal policies. Therefore, complete tax and public grain regulations must be formulated to ensure that what is taken from the people is used for the people. A large-scale production campaign is planned to be launched next year, with a focus on developing industries such as mining. In terms of education, the focus will be on rectifying primary and secondary schools and teacher training education, with the Education Committee and Northeast University cooperating to compile teaching materials. On the issue of work style, it is necessary to establish a practical and simple work style of the people's democratic government. Government personnel at all levels must proceed from the interests of the people, develop a realistic and pragmatic, honest and upright work style, and ensure that their standard of living does not exceed that of the average person.

　　东北政联行政委员会
    拟定半年施政方针
    改造政权改变作风真正为人民服务
    【新华社哈尔滨四日电】东北政联行政委员会已拟定今后半年施政方针，此为八月三十一日该会第二次会议所决定者，并将于日内通令各省执行。该施政方针第一条是改造政权，规定今后半年内首先初步改造村政权，并使区乡政权组织机构和作风上都成为真正人民的政权。明春召开各省行政会议总结工作，并准备召开全东北人民代表会议。为此，就必须贯彻施政纲领，使农民获得土地。要在分配敌伪土地的基础上，改造村政权，使村政权成为以农民为骨干。目前民政委员会的主要工作之一，就是制定与颁布土地条例。关于县、市等上层政权的改造，则采取轮训办法，实行简政，以改变旧的作风。在财政方面：各省要做到统筹统支及在财政政策上的统一，因此必须制定完整的税收与公粮条例，做到取之于民用之于民。计划于明年开展大生产运动，并选择重点发展工矿等业。在教育方面：着重整顿中小学及师范教育，由教育委员会与东北大学合作编撰教材。在作风问题上，要建立人民民主政府的踏实朴素作风，各级政府人员必须从人民的利益出发，养成实事求是，廉洁奉公，生活上不得超过一般人民的水平。
