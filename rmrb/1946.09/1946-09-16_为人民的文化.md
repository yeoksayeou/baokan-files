　　Culture for the People

　　Taiyue Cultural Workers Go to the Countryside
　　[Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th dispatch] At the preparatory meeting of the Taiyue Federation of Literary and Art Circles held on the 6th of this month, Comrade Li Zheren, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, earnestly called on cultural workers to directly participate in the mass movement, experience and reflect the lives of the masses, implement "going up and down," and change the past practice of only sitting in the room to compile publications. In order to unify strength and improve quality, the comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed to immediately stop publishing periodicals such as "Economic Work," "Education Newsletter," and "New Literature," and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles will publish another comprehensive publication, "Taiyue Culture," which is scheduled to be published in early October. The editorial board has been elected by everyone, consisting of more than ten people including Li Zheren, Sun Dingguo, Pei Lisheng, Cui Douchen, and Wei Keming.

　　Shimin's Liberated Peasants Raise Funds to Run Schools Themselves
　　[Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th dispatch] The liberated masses are showing great interest in improving their culture. The liberated peasants in ten administrative villages in the second district of Shimin voluntarily raised 51 dan of wheat to establish a private senior primary school, and more than 60 students have already enrolled. Among the new students admitted to Qinyuan No. 4 Senior Primary School this autumn, there are 11 children of hired laborers, 3 children of handicraftsmen, 27 children of tenant farmers, 7 children of family members of soldiers, 24 children of middle peasants, and 4 children of landlords. Children from poor families account for more than 65% of the students in the entire school.

　　Lucheng Cultural Cooperative Prints and Sells 40,000 Volumes of Textbooks
　　[Our newspaper, Changzhi dispatch] The Lucheng Cultural Cooperative has developed from a small stall into a general cooperative, three branches, a woodcut printing factory, a paper mill, and a straw hat factory in the past six months. The business has grown from two people to 67 people (including workers). More than 4,600 children, teachers, and intellectuals in the countryside have been united to subscribe for shares. In the past three months, the total number of reprinted elementary school textbooks was more than 58,000 copies, and folk school textbooks were more than 4,200 copies, providing the government with more than 40,000 copies of forms, marriage certificates, contracts, and stock certificates. In addition to supplying the county, textbooks can be supplied to the Changzhi General Store and four counties including Licheng, Tunliu, and Qin County. When the accounts were settled in June this year, the 280,000 yuan of shares earned a dividend of more than 767,000 yuan. After the dividends were distributed, the reputation of the cultural cooperative greatly improved, and people scrambled to buy shares. In the future, preparations will be made to consolidate and develop on the existing basis.
