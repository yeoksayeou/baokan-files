　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to a United Press report from Washington, ten hours after submitting his resignation on the 20th of this month, Wallace delivered a national broadcast address, stating: "In my position, I firmly believe that there is no more important task for me than to strive for peace. I believe that our current foreign policy does not recognize the fundamental realities that cause another world war, and this policy is likely to cause another war." Wallace spoke of Truman's order for him to resign so that he would not discuss foreign policy, saying, "But I am also unwilling to make statements that might hinder the success of the Paris Peace Conference. I do believe that my speech in Madison Square Garden caused widespread misunderstanding, and I need to explain some sincere misunderstandings. I believe that striving for peace is more important than high office and generous salary, and more important than any consideration for political parties. Therefore, striving for peace is extremely realistic and extremely important. Each and every one of us should regard participation in the struggle as a sacred responsibility." Wallace reiterated, "I do not intend to live in two worlds. I have always wholeheartedly advocated that people living in one world, if they cannot achieve the goal of one world, cannot achieve peace." Wallace also said, "I must emphasize one point, that the concept of one world must be upheld, and any regionalism must exist in order to make the world's economic and political realities achieve practical form. The success of any policy ultimately depends on the trust and willingness of the people." Wallace concluded, "I am willing to continue to fight for peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to a United Press report from New York, after Wallace called on his followers to unite in a four-minute broadcast address on the evening of the 20th, Railway Workers' Union President Whitney launched a movement to nominate Wallace as the leader of the movement to strive for sound and progressive government. It is widely believed that Whitney intends to propose Wallace as a future presidential candidate within or outside the Democratic Party, and to nominate Poebel as his assistant. Labor leaders, New Deal figures, and left-wing Democrats, as well as Ohio Republican Senator Morse, also support Wallace. Whitney had vowed four months ago to use the entire $60 million fund of the Railway Workers' Union to defeat Truman's re-election as president because Truman had suppressed the railway workers' major strike.

　　华莱士辞职后广播演说
    美国外交将挑起战争渠仍将为和平而奋斗
    惠特尼发起争取进步政府运动
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据合众社华盛顿讯：本月二十日华莱士于提出辞呈十小时后，即对全国发表广播演说，内称：“我以我之地位，坚信我除为和平努力外，别无其他更重要之工作。我认为我们的现行外交政策，并未认识引起再次世界大战之基本现实，此种政策终有引起另一次战争之虑。”华氏谈及杜鲁门命令他辞职，使他勿谈外交政策时说：“但我亦不愿发表可能防碍巴黎和会成功之言论，我的确认为我在麦迪逊广场范围中发表演说后，引起广泛之误解，我对于若干真诚的误解，有予以解释之必要。我认为争取和平比高官厚禄更属重要，亦较对于政党之任何顾虑重要，因此为争取和平而奋斗，实乃极端现实极端重要之事。我们的每一份子，均应视参加奋斗为一种神圣之责任。”华氏再度强调说：“我不拟在两个世界中生活，我一向衷心主张在一个世界中生活之人民，如不能达到一个世界之目的，即不能获致和平。”华氏并谓：“余应强调一点，即一个世界之观念必须坚持，如为使世界经济与政治现实获致实际形式起见，而必须有任何区域主义之存在。任何政策之成功，终有赖于人民之信任与意愿。华氏最后称：“我愿继续为和平而奋斗。”
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据合众社纽约电称：在华莱士二十日晚四分钟的广播演说中号召他的信徒们团结起来之后，铁路工人工会主席惠特尼发起推举华莱士为争取健全及进步政府运动之领袖，众信惠特尼意欲提出华莱士作为民主党内或党外的未来总统候选人，并推举泼贝尔为其助手。劳工领袖、新政分子以及民主党内的左翼分子俄亥俄州的共和党参议员摩尔斯，亦支持华莱士。惠特尼曾于四个月前发誓以全部铁路工人工会的六千万美元基金，击败杜鲁门连任总统，因杜鲁门曾压制铁路工人的大罢工。
