　　Supporting the Front Lines with Practical Actions: Jinnan Supply Department Rushes to Make Cotton-Padded Clothes
　　Production Increased by 50% in Four Days; Comrades Luan Xingchen and others Make Thirty Sets a Day
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 26th Dispatch] After the Clothing Institute of the Military Region Supply Department launched a shock campaign on the 2nd of this month, production increased by 25% to 50% in four days. The first shift completes one hundred sets of clothes a day. All other shifts achieve more than eighty sets, the cutting room increased from 110 sets per table per day to 300 sets. Comrade × Tuguo of the third shift sewed the outer material of ninety sets of cotton-padded clothes a day, and Luan Xingchen of the fourth shift made a complete thirty sets a day. Both of them have more than doubled their past output. It is estimated that through this shock campaign, the entire winter clothing task can be completed half a month ahead of schedule. Cadres of the Clothing Institute are also directly participating in the work. Comrade Zhou Donghai of the storage section continues to card cotton while sick. Comrade Wang Zhendong of the materials section is busy measuring cloth all day. Instructor Wang × personally goes to the countryside to find female workers. Institute Director Zhang Wenqing suffers from eye problems, and Deputy Instructor Shi Yuyan suffers from dysentery, but both participate in the work without exception. Their slogan is "Minor illnesses do not delay work," just like the troops on the battlefield put forward "Minor injuries do not leave the front line."

　　用实际行动支援前线冀南供给部赶制棉衣
　　四天内产量提高百分之五十栾兴臣等同志一天做三十套
    【本报威县二十六日电】军区供给部被服所从本月二日发动突击运动后，在四天中产量已提高了百分之二十五到五十。第一班一天完成一百套衣服。其他各班都做到八十套以上，裁剪房由每案每天一百一十套增到三百套，三班×土国同志一天缝了九十套棉衣面子，四班栾兴臣一天做了整身三十套。他两人都比过去增加了二倍。估计经此次突击，整个冬衣任务可提前完成半月。被服所干部们也直接参加工作，保管股周东海同志带病弹花，材料股王振东同志整天忙着量布，指导员王×同志亲自下乡找女工。所长张文清害眼，副指导员史玉言患痢疾均无例外的参加工作，他们的口号是“轻病不误工作”，像战场打仗的部队提出“轻伤不下火线”一样。
