[Reported from this newspaper's Handan office on the 21st] The Chiang Kai-shek war clique, determined to wipe out the military and civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area in one fell swoop, is implementing its conspiracy to firmly control the Longhai Railway and connect the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. After suffering setbacks in its previous invasion of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan hinterland, it is now redeploying a large number of troops from various locations to the front lines of the renewed invasion of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan hinterland. The 85th Division, originally stationed in the Xinxiang area of northern Henan, with the exception of one regiment left to guard, moved east on the 15th of this month to the areas of Yanjin and Fengqiu; the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, originally stationed in the areas of Huojia and Huixian, also moved to Fengqiu at the same time; the 40th Division, originally stationed in Anyang, has been assembled in Xinxiang awaiting orders, and its 318th Regiment, originally reinforcing Tangyin, has now moved east in its entirety; the 49th Brigade of the 27th Division, attached with 160 vehicles, has arrived in Changyuan, east of Fengqiu. In order to arrange this larger-scale invasion, Kuomintang Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fan Hanjie, and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng have all personally gone to the front lines to command, and the war instigator Chiang Kai-shek also arrived in Xinxiang on the 14th. This newspaper's reporter, synthesizing the above information, points out that under the arson of the traitorous war instigator Chiang Kai-shek, a major battle is about to unfold on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan plain, and the Chiang army, which is "coming fiercely," in addition to the original troops that had suffered defeats in the first battle, are mostly drawn from the areas of northern Henan that confront us, which is enough to prove their lack of strength. Currently, our army in northern Henan and other places has universally launched offensive operations on its behind. In northern Henan, on the evening of the 16th, a unit of our army destroyed six iron bridges north and south of Qixian, including those in Gaocun, Xinan Village, and Xiaocun, forcing the suspension of Chiang's military transport on the Xinxiang-Anyang section of the Pinghan Railway. On the same evening, our army in southern Hebei once again launched a surprise attack from east to west on the Chiang-puppet military-controlled area southwest of Liuyuan in Linzhang, capturing key locations such as Yong'an Town and Beiqi Village, and continuing to expand the results of the battle. By the 19th, our army in Taihang had also recovered Wangjia Yao and Tangjia Ao southwest of Tangyin, and the unit is now approaching Tangyin City. On the same day, a main force of our army in Anyang also launched a counter-offensive, inflicting a major blow on the puppet army of Wang Zi, killing and wounding more than a hundred people and seizing six machine guns. Our army is now taking advantage of the victory to pursue and annihilate the enemy. In eastern Henan, our guerrilla corps recovered Taikang County again on the 18th and are continuing to expand their offensive.
    [Reported from this newspaper's Longhai Front on the 21st] Our local guerrilla corps in eastern Henan recovered Taikang City again on September 18th. Our democratic government entered the city and immediately provided relief and comfort to the citizens who had been repeatedly ravaged by the Chiang army, and order in the city has been rapidly restored. This city was recovered by our army on August 29th during the Longhai counter-offensive campaign and was forcibly occupied by Liu Jimin's 75th Division of the Chiang army on September 9th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tengxian, 21st] Chiang's army, entrenched in Lincheng and Hanzhuang on the Jinpu Railway, attempted to meet from the north and south to open up the railway section, but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army. On the 18th, about 2,000 men from two regiments of the 33rd Division of Chiang's 97th Army, with a steel cannon, invaded Xiaozhuang (more than ten miles south of the city) from Lincheng. The Eighth Route Army and the militia counterattacked, killing and wounding more than 200 Chiang soldiers and forcing them to retreat back to Lincheng. On the same day, about 2,000 men from the 113th Brigade (renamed from the division) and other units of the 51st Division (renamed from the army) of the Chiang army invaded from Hanzhuang, but were repelled by the Eighth Route Army and fled back in panic.
