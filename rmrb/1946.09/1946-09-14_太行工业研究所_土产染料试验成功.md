　　Taihang Industrial Research Institute
    Successfully Experiments with Native Dyes
    [This newspaper, Changzhi] In the movement to increase production for self-defense and advocate for the use of domestic goods, Chang Meicai, Tang Kemin, and others at the Taihang Industrial Research Institute have used local raw materials to produce two types of dyes for wool and cotton in blue and tan colors. The color of cotton is slightly darker. The blue dye is made by grinding two ounces of limonite into a fine powder, adding one ounce of sulfuric acid, and oxidizing it for four to five days until it becomes a yellow powder. After dissolving it in water and removing the lower layer of residue, one qian of gallnut liquid is added. There are two methods for making tan dye: (1) Sun-dry green walnut husks, place them in a pot, and boil for three to four hours. Remove the residue and add alum. Each jin of walnut husks can dye half a jin of wool. (2) Add fifteen jin of water to ten jin of green walnut husks, soak for three to four days, and when black foam appears, put them in a pot and simmer for about three hours. Remove the residue, add alum, and then simmer over low heat until it becomes a paste. Four and a half liang can dye half a jin of wool or cloth.
    Furthermore, the spinning and weaving technology of the textile experimental factory affiliated with the institute has been improving recently. Each worker can spin 1.5 to 2 jin of yarn. The amount of cloth woven by each worker has increased from 3.2 to 4 zhang of narrow (1.4 shichi) cloth to 5.5 to 6 zhang of wide (2.6 shichi) cloth. The highest output is even 8 zhang. To promote the technology, the institute will open a spinning and weaving training class. Students will be recommended by cooperatives from various counties and districts, and the class will begin in early September.

　　太行工业研究所
    土产染料试验成功
    【本报长治讯】在增产自卫倡用国货运动中，太行工业研究所常美才、唐克敏等，利用本区土产原料制出蓝色、驼色染毛染料两种，染棉亦可，惟色泽稍暗。蓝色系将褐铁矿二两研为细末，加硫酸一两，氧化四五日成黄色粉末后，用水溶解，去掉下层渣滓，加五倍子液一钱即成。驼色有二：（一）核桃青皮经日光晒干，置锅内煮三至四小时，去滓加明矾即成。每斤核桃皮可染毛半斤。（二）核桃青皮十斤，加水十五斤，浸三四日后，发现黑色泡沫开放锅内熬约三小时，去渣加矾，再用温火煎成膏状即成。四两半即可染毛或布半斤。
    又：该所所属纺织实验工厂近来纺织技术日有改进。每工可纺纱一斤半至二斤，织布每工由窄面（市尺一尺四）布三丈二尺至四丈，增到宽面（二尺六）布五丈五尺到六丈。最高并有八丈者。为推广技术，该所将开办纺织训练班，由各县区合作社保送学员，九月上旬即可开学。
