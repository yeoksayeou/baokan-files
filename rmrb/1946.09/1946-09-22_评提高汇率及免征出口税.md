　　On Raising Exchange Rates and Exempting Export Taxes
    Xu Fanglue
    Last month, on the 19th, the Nationalist government raised the foreign exchange rate (from 2,020 legal tender to one US dollar, to 3,350 legal tender), and implemented an exemption of export taxes on permitted export commodities. Song Ziwen said in a statement that this move "aims to balance import and export trade, and to promote the vigorous development of productive enterprises." The financial and economic officials and propaganda organs of the Nationalist government have also made many similar promotions. However, all these words prove to be false and deceptive in the face of facts.
    The measures of the 19th will not only fail to develop productive enterprises, but will also absolutely fail to save the current production crisis in the Nationalist-controlled areas. The severity of this crisis is a stalemate that even the Nationalist Party's Central Weekly had to admit was "impossible to clean up." The main reasons for this stalemate are the civil war, the economic aggression of American imperialism, and the control and monopoly of Nationalist bureaucratic capital. The economic aggression of American imperialism - the import of goods and capital into China, under the Nationalist government's unconditional welcome policy, and the Nationalist comprador-bureaucratic group's unlimited purchase of American goods and cooperation with American capital in auctioning off national interests - has already acquired customs rights, inland river navigation rights, air transport rights, and the new company law, providing various protections and assistance to foreign capital, and the power to manage foreign exchange and import and export is completely in the hands of the American imperialists' agents in China - the Nationalist comprador lords. They have also established large import companies to serve the commodity dumping of their American masters. The unconditional arrival of American imperialism's huge capital and its "cheap and good" commodities has become the deadly enemy of national industry, and is destined to destroy national industry. American goods have seriously devastated national industry, and the monopoly and control, speculation and manipulation of Nationalist comprador-bureaucratic capital are suffocating and have already killed off national industry, powerfully assisting their American masters in the devastation of national industry. The civil war is currently the most brutal sweeping away of national industry and economic vitality. Due to the civil war, the famine and inflation have deepened, causing transportation to be ineffective, so national industry is trapped in a serious increase in costs, a heavy burden, transportation stagnation, and no way to sell (because farmers and people have lost their purchasing power), and therefore is increasingly unable to resist American economic oppression. The fact that the exchange rate is lower than the rate of price increases is certainly a factor that is favorable to imports and unfavorable to exports, but the fundamental reason that drives national industry to collapse, that is, makes China a colony of the United States, is the aforementioned three. Obviously, none of these three fundamental reasons have been solved in the measures of the 19th, so it is impossible to solve the crisis of national industry.
    As for exempting export taxes on permitted export goods, it may slightly increase exports, but it will never fundamentally solve the export crisis and reduce the trade deficit. The fact is that: according to a report by the Central News Agency, exports in August were only a quarter of the total value of imports, and this does not include the increasingly rampant smuggling of American goods - a figure like a river bursting its banks. This is because the fundamental reason for the reduction of exports is the decline of Chinese industry. Now that the fundamental obstacles to the development of production have not only not been removed, but the pain is getting worse and worse, but only trying to find solutions from the trivial, and wanting to use old methods to "balance import and export trade" is no different from a fool's dream. To put it bluntly, it is actually a self-deceiving trick.
    The facts of the past half month prove that the only result of raising the foreign exchange rate is that the financial and economic crisis in the Nationalist-controlled areas has deepened. As the exchange rate rises, prices immediately rise by about 40%, because the exchange rate has increased by 60%, which is also a 40% devaluation of the legal tender. This not only shows that the effect of the exchange rate increase is equal to zero, but it also causes the Nationalist-controlled areas to re-enter a new vicious cycle of mutual influence and competition between foreign exchange and prices from 1938 to 1941. This evil factor that stimulates further inflation, at a time when the amount of legal tender issued has reached 140 trillion yuan, is a major tragedy for the Nationalist government's finances, a kick in the teeth for the national industry and small and medium-sized industrialists who are on the verge of collapse (because inflation causes small and medium-sized capital to be subject to increased costs, relatively low income, and the attack of large capital taking the opportunity to manipulate prices). For the people in the Nationalist-controlled areas who hold legal tender and purchase commodities, especially workers, citizens and public and educational personnel who live on wages and salaries, it is a further driving force towards hunger and death. As the Shanghai newspaper said: "The people's property was lost by 48% overnight, and the lives of salaried workers and all the people will be more difficult in the future due to soaring prices." This is also the reason why Nanjing civil servants and non-civil servants cried out "Long live Song Ziwen" to protest.
    As mentioned above, the so-called development of production and balanced import and export trade is a beautiful lie. The real motive of the Executive Yuan's new measures is firstly to ease and perfunctorily deal with the dissatisfaction of industrialists and businessmen in the Nationalist-controlled areas. Everyone knows that the business community is increasingly dissatisfied with and resisting the Nationalist ruling group's policy of unconditionally welcoming foreign capital and foreign goods, and the evil consequences of the dumping of American goods in the domestic market. However, this attempt is ineffective, because the new measures cannot and do not solve the problem. Second, to slightly compensate for the financial losses, because the deficit of the 50 trillion yuan foreign exchange fund can no longer support the payment of the trade deficit. However, this attempt is also ineffective, because the new measures cannot and do not fundamentally solve the problem of the trade deficit. Third, for the Nationalist comprador-bureaucratic capital group itself (they, and only they, monopolize and hoard large amounts of private American dollars, gold and commodities) to take advantage of the opportunity of the exchange rate increase and soaring prices to sweep away wealth from the national Nationalist-controlled areas once again, this goal has undoubtedly been achieved. The following report is one proof - a special dispatch in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 22nd of last month: It is rumored in Nanjing that the exchange rate was raised at this time because three major trading companies (i.e. the companies of the Kong Song consortium) operated by certain minority figures recently purchased a large number of daily necessities from the United States, and more than 15,000 tons are about to be imported, so they first increased their prices to reap huge profits.

　　评提高汇率及免征出口税
    徐方略
    国民党政府于上月十九日提高外汇汇率（自美金一元兑法币二千零二十元，提至兑三千三百五十元），并实行免除准许出口商品之出口税。宋子文在声明中说：此举“目的在求输出入贸易之平衡，及生产事业之活泼发展。”国民党政府的财政经济要员及宣传机关，也作了许多类似的鼓吹。但是所有这些词令，在事实面前证明是虚妄和欺骗。
    十九日的措施，不但不能发展生产事业，而且也绝对不可能挽救当前国民党区的生产危机。这个危机的严重性，就是国民党中央周刊也不得不承认为“无法收拾”的僵局了。造成这种僵局主要原因，乃是由于内战、美国帝国主义的经济侵略、和国民党官僚资本的统制与垄断。美国帝国主义的经济侵略——商品与资本输至中国，在国民党政府无条件欢迎的政策下，在国民党买办官僚集团无限制的买办美货及与美资合作的拍卖民族利益的勾当下，已经取得了海关权、内河航行权、空运权和新公司法，对于外资的种种保护与帮助，美外汇与进出口的管理大权又完全操在美国帝国主义的在华代理人——国民党买办老爷们之手。他们又成立了大的进口公司，为其美国主子的商品倾销服务，美国帝国主义的巨大资本及其“价廉物美”的商品的无条件的到来，成为民族工业的死敌，注定了民族工业的覆亡。美国商品已经严重的摧残着民族工业，国民党买办官僚资本的垄断与统制、投机操纵，窒息着并已经格杀着民族工业，有力的帮助着他们美国主子对民族工业的摧残。内战乃是当前最凶暴的对于民族工业和经济生机的大扫荡。由于内战，加深了粮荒和通货膨胀，造成了运输的不灵，因此民族工业陷于严重的成本增高，负担奇重，运输停顿，销售无路（因为农民和人民失却了购买力）的悲境，并因此益无力抵抗美国经济压迫。外汇率低于物价上涨的程度，固然是对进口有利、和对出口不利的一个因素，但是使民族产业走向崩溃，也就是使中国走向美国殖民地的根本原因，乃是前述三条。显然，这三个根本原因，在十九日的措施中，没有一个问题获得解决，因之决不能解决民族产业的危机。
    至于免除准许出口货物的出口税，或许可使出口稍微增加，但也决不可能从根本上解决出口危机与减少入超。事实就是这样证明了：据中央社的报导，八月份的出口也仅仅为进口总值的四分之一，其中美货走私——这个日益增剧、若决口江河的数字还不在内。这是因为出口的减少，根本原因乃是由于中国产业的衰落。现在发展生产的根本障碍不但毫未解除，而且病痛愈来愈重，却只从枝节上想办法，要想用老办法来“平衡进出口贸易”，无异痴人说梦。拆穿说，实际又是一种自欺欺人的把戏。
    半月来的事实，证明提高外汇的唯一结果，乃是国民党区的财政经济危机更加加深，随着汇率的提高，物价立时上涨百分之四十左右，因为外汇率提高了百分之六十，同时也就是将法币贬值百分之四十，这不仅说明汇率提高的作用已等于零，而且它使国民党区重新陷入了一九三八年至四一年的外汇与物价相互影响、互相竞赛的新的恶性循环当中。此种刺激通货更加膨胀的恶因素，在法币发行额已达十四万万万元的今日，对于国民党财政是一个大的悲剧，对于走向崩溃中的民族产业和中小工商业家是一个落井下石的打击（因为通货膨胀使中小资本陷于成本提高，收入相对的低落，以及大资本乘机操锋价格的打击之下）。对于作为法币持有人和商品的购买者的国民党区的老百姓，特别是依工资、薪金为生的工人市民与公教人员，是一个进一步驱之于饥饿死亡的魔手。正如沪报所云：“人民的财产在一夕之间就损失了百分之四十八，今后薪水阶级的生活及一切人民的生活，因物价飞涨更难上加难”。这也就是南京公务员与非公务员流泪大喊“宋子文万岁”，以示抗议的原由。
    以上所述，所谓发展生产及平衡输出入贸易的说法，乃是一种美丽的谎言，行政院这次新措施的真实动机，第一是为了缓和与敷衍国民党区工商业家的不满。尽人皆知，工商界对国民党统治集团无条件欢迎外资与外货的政策，及美货在国内市场倾销的恶果不满与反抗，正日益增长。但是，这一企图是无效果的，因为新措施不能而且也没有解决问题。第二为了稍事弥补财政上的亏累，因为五万万元外汇基金的亏空，已不能支持入超的付出。但是，这一企图又是无效果的，因为新的措施不能而且也没有从根本上解决入超问题。第三为了国民党买办官僚资本集团自己（他们，也只有他们垄断和囤积着大量的私有美钞、黄金和商品）乘外汇提高物价暴涨之机，又一次的向全国民党区席卷财富，这一目的却无疑的是达到了。下面的报导就是证明之一——天津大公报上月二十二日专电：南京盛传汇率恰于此时提高，是因为某些少数人物所经营的三大贸易公司（按即孔宋财团的公司），近自美国购进了大批日用品，一万五千余吨即将进口，故先增其价，以收大利。
