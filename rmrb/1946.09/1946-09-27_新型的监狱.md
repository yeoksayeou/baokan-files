　　New Type of Prison
　　Qin Silin
　　Every blade of grass and tree in the liberated areas is developing on a new path.

　　Chiang Kai-shek is the source of all evil. His capitulation to foreign enemies and his dark rule domestically have led thousands upon thousands of people astray, causing them to be abandoned by the people.

　　After the Eighth Route Army liberated northern Henan, the people stood up, rising from the persecution of enemy puppets, local bullies, secret agents, and black-gunners, and sent these henchmen to prisons and detention centers to reflect, correct their mistakes, transform themselves, and start anew!

　　This is not a Chiang Kai-shek-style concentration camp, but a place for those who have gone astray to reform themselves. All cruel punishments have disappeared. There is no stepping on bars, pouring chili water, hammering nails...

　　In terms of life, self-reformers implement self-government. In the Jiaozuo prison, there is a Living Committee, democratically elected by the self-reformers' congress, with committees and clerks for production, learning, hygiene, and living, leading and promoting all activities.

　　Apart from sleeping at night, self-reformers spend most of their time in free activities: reading newspapers, producing goods, playing chess, sitting in the yard chatting. The prisons are not high walls and thick walls, but the doors are open, and they can walk around freely, or go to other people's rooms to discuss issues, and collectively study current affairs. From the analysis of the current situation to the ugliness of the old society, everyone discusses why they committed crimes, the democratic government's lenient policies, and how to start anew.

　　Initially, they were afraid and did not believe in the democratic government's lenient policies. Like the prisoners sent from Wen County, when asked, they always said, "I don't even know what crime I committed! I was sent here in a daze." But after being influenced and educated by this democratic life, they realized that they had made mistakes. Yang Cai from the Second District was a new soldier who was preparing to shoot a cadre with a black gun. With the help of those active elements, he confessed. The village chief of Xizhou Village said, "In the past, I didn't dare to tell my mistakes. I thought if I didn't say it, you could only kill me, but if I talked about it, my whole family would be killed!" There was also Chen Shijun, who colluded with enemy puppets to sell drugs. One day in the middle of the night, he woke people up from their dreams and shouted, "Everyone listen, I'm confessing!" Everyone applauded him, welcoming his self-reform action! In twenty days, twenty-seven out of fifty people reported the details of their crimes at the self-reformers' congress or in the Justice Section Chief's office.

　　The hygiene work in the prison is also very careful. I once visited a prison in Jiaozuo. The walls were snow-white, and the courtyard and houses were cleaned very clean. Some even had bamboo curtains. The Bo'ai prison had skylights on the roof, and there was also a sick room.

　　Generally, self-reformers know that the democratic government truly wants to pull them out of their mistakes, so there are very few escapes. Zhang Shoushan, a self-reformer from Bo'ai, went to paste paper on the Tax Bureau's house, and as a result, he ran away. After running away, he had nowhere to go, and he thought about joining the army. Someone asked him, "Have you settled your affairs?" He replied, "No." "You can't join the army if you haven't." He had no choice but to go home. After living there for a few days, he regretted it more and more. He asked the Farmers' Association chairman to intercede with the detention center, and he voluntarily returned to the center. The self-reformers immediately discussed this matter in the meeting and on the wall newspaper as an educational example. There was also a man named Liu Yanfeng, who had been a puppet soldier and embezzled public funds. After he ran away, he was caught back. After everyone discussed it, they said that he did not correct his mistakes, was stubbornly stubborn, and did not understand the situation, and decided that he should be strictly guarded.

　　Initially, the proposal for production was opposed by the self-reformers. For example, in the court prison, Han Shuzhi, a puppet army regimental commander, sighed and said, "Production will shorten my life by five years!" Some thought it was forced labor. Only after ideological study combined with the practical encouragement of the dividend system did they understand it.

　　Production is almost entirely based on gradually laying the foundation with manual labor. Like the Bo'ai detention center, after proposing that everyone work together to improve their lives, Comrade Zhang Zaiyang, the Justice Section Chief, went deep into the self-reformers to study the ways and methods of production. At first, he found that three people could weave bamboo goods, so he patiently mobilized them to find apprentices. Originally, these craftsmen were unwilling to pass on their skills, but after everyone's research and call, they suddenly took ten apprentices. Comrade Zhang Zaiyang also personally participated, learning with the self-reformers. This greatly moved those who usually did not engage in production labor. Soon, these ten people completely learned it. In the weaving of bamboo goods, after everyone's discussion, it was decided to calculate work by points, issue work tickets every day, and divide the profits at the end of the month based on the work tickets (80% for public, 20% for private). At the end of May, six people were rewarded, each with 90 to 100 yuan, and they ate water chestnuts and held a tea party to celebrate the victory of production. This greatly encouraged the self-reformers' enthusiasm for labor. The "technicians" also felt it was glorious to have taught many apprentices. By the end of July, the number of people participating in the weaving had increased to more than fifty, and five women had also joined. In May and July, each person received an average dividend of one thousand yuan. The self-reformers felt that their thinking had improved, they had overcome the lazy habits they had developed in the old society, and they had learned skills, so they were very happy.

　　This kind of labor production fully utilized the various skills of the self-reformers. For example, the court prison was divided into sewing, agriculture, commerce, small shops, grinding, and carpentry production groups according to each person's expertise.

　　In the production and self-reform movement, the lives of the self-reformers have been greatly improved. The houses are cleaner, and when they are sick, not only is there someone to take care of them, but they can also buy medicine and see a doctor in time. For example, self-reformers in Bo'ai can often get injections when they are sick, and rest quietly in the sick room.

　　新型的监狱
　　秦思林
    解放区的一草一木都在新生的道路上发展着。
    蒋介石是一切罪恶之源，他的对外投敌卖国对内黑暗统治，使成千成万的人走错了道路，而遭到人民的遗弃。
    八路军解放豫北之后，人民翻身了，从敌伪恶霸特务黑枪手的迫害生活中站立起来，把这些爪牙送入监狱与看守所，让他们去反省、改错、转变、重新做人！
    这里不是蒋介石式的集中营，而是走错了道路的人的自新所，一切残酷的刑罚都已绝迹，没有踩杠子，灌辣子水、钉指甲……。
    生活上实行自新人自治，在焦作监狱内设有生活委员会，由自新人大会民主选举生产、学习、卫生、生活等委员和干事，领导与推动一切活动。
    自新人每天除了夜晚睡觉之外，大部时间是在自由的活动着，读报、生产、下棋，坐在院子里谈天，狱所里并非高墙厚壁，而是房门敞开着，可以自由走来走去，或到别人的房子里去扯扯问题，到一块集体学时事。从目前时局分析到旧社会的丑恶，大家讨论为什么会犯罪，民主政府的宽大政策和如何重新作人。
    最初，他们害怕，不相信民主政府的宽大政策，像温县从外边送来的犯人，先问他，他总说：“我也不知道我犯了什么罪！糊糊涂涂就把我送来了。”可是经过这种民主生活的感化教育之后，才觉得自己是有错误，二区杨才是个新战士，准备打干部的黑枪，经过那些积极分子的帮助便坦白了，西周村保长说：“从前我不敢说出自己的错处，我觉得我不说你只能杀我一个，谈出来全家就要被杀！”还有一个陈世俊，勾结敌伪卖毒品，有一天半夜他把别人从梦中叫起大声喊道：“大家听着，我坦白啦呀！”大家为他鼓掌，欢迎他这种自新行动！二十天功夫，五十人中就有二十七人在自新人大会上或在司法科长的房子里很详细的报告他们犯罪的经过。
    监狱里的卫生工作也很注意，我曾参观过焦作的一个监狱，雪白的墙壁，院子房子都打扫得很干净，并且有的还挂着竹帘，博爱的监狱房顶上都开有天窗，另外还设有病号室。
    一般自新人都知道民主政府真正要把他们从错误中拉出来，所以跑逃的现象也很少。博爱自新人张寿山去跟税务局糊房子，结果偷跑了，跑了以后没处去，又想着去参军，有人问他：“你的事情了啦没有？”他答：“没有”。“没有不能入伍”，他没办法，回到家，住了几天越想越后悔。请了农会主席到看守所说情，他又自动回了所。自新人立即在会议上墙报上讨论这件事，作为教育例子。还有一个叫刘岩峰，当过伪军也贪污过公款，跑了之后，把他捉回来，经自新人大家讨论。说他不改错，死顽固，太不懂情，决议须严格看管。
    最初提出生产，曾遭到自新人的反对，如法院监狱，一个伪军团长韩树芝长吁短叹说：“生产少活五年！”有的认为这是罚苦工，经过思想学习结合分红制的实际鼓励才弄通了。
    生产几乎全是先以担挑劳动逐渐打下基础的，像博爱看守所，提出大家动手改善生活之后，司法科长张载阳同志即深入到自新人之中去研究生产的方式方法，最初发现有三个人会编竹货，于是耐心的动员他们自找对象，带徒弟，本来这种手艺人是不愿传徒的，经过大家研究号召，一下子带了十个徒弟，张载阳同志也亲自参加，跟自新人一齐学习。大大感动了这些平时不务生产劳动的人，很快这十个人完全学会了，在编竹货中经过大家讨论决定以分计工，每天发工票，到月底凭工票二八分红，（公八分私二分）五月底总结时，提奖了六个人，每人九十元至一百元，并且吃荸荠举行茶话会，庆祝生产胜利，这样大大鼓励了自新人的劳动热忱，“技师”也觉得带会很多徒弟很光荣，到七月底参加编制的人就增加到五十多个，并且有五个妇女也参加了。五、七两月每人均分得千元红利。自新人感到思想变好了，克服了在旧社会里养成的二流子不愿劳动的习气，又学得了技术，都很高兴。
    这种劳动生产充分的发挥了自新人的各种本领，像法院监狱就是按各人特长划分为缝纫、农业、商业、小铺、推磨、木匠各种生产小组的。
    在生产自新运动中，自新人的生活大大得到改善，房子更加干净了，生了病不但有人照护，还可以即时买药就医，像博爱自新人病了还能经常注射针药，安安静静的在病号室里休息。
