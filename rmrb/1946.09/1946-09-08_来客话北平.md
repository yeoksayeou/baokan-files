A Visitor Talks About Beiping

　　Recently, Beiping City has been busy with three things: First, busy building bunkers. The Beiping authorities, as if seeing ghosts in broad daylight, are building street fortifications all over the important streets and alleys, and spreading rumors that the Eighth Route Army is about to attack the city. For a time, people were panic-stricken, especially the "flying visitors." They originally lived in magnificent and luxurious government offices, but now they are moving out to live in "received" civilian houses, supposedly for better safety. Second, busy with corruption. This group of "flying visitors," big and small, are busy all day long figuring out how to steal and make a fortune, engaging in "five sons reaching the top." Therefore, it also brought a "prosperous scene" of "songs and dances of peace" to Beiping's restaurants, theaters, dance halls, cinemas, and the Eight Great Alleys. Third, secret agents and military police are busy arresting people. They are busy everywhere arresting progressive youths and democrats. The atmosphere of terror from recent massive roundups by the secret police far exceeds that of the Third Regiment of Military Police under Jiang Xiaoxian in 1933 and the era of Japanese rule.

　　Since the National Government "recovered" Peiping and Tianjin, the Ministry of Education in Nanjing had explicitly stipulated that all graduates, undergraduates, teachers, and professors of all levels of schools since 1937 should be prefixed with the word "puppet" and all undergo screening examinations. The other medicine hidden in this gourd was actually to use this as an excuse to cleanse progressive elements on the one hand, and to take the opportunity to vigorously develop the Three People's Principles Youth League and secret service organizations on the other, thereby achieving the effect of suppressing the patriotic anti-civil war activities of students and youths in Peiping and Tianjin. For a time, public opinion in the schools was in an uproar, and they rose up in opposition. Zhu Jiahua always ordered to insist on implementation, unmoved. Not long after, a group of more than sixty professors and students from Beiping Institute of Technology, heartbroken by the dark rule of the Kuomintang authorities, fled to Zhangjiakou one after another, and were warmly welcomed by the democratic government of the Liberated Area and the youth and education circles. When this news spread to Peiping, it caused a sensation among the youth, and for a time, those who fled were in an endless stream. This also shocked the Kuomintang fascists' rule over the youth, so they had to temporarily postpone it, and this issue remains an unresolved pending case. On the other hand, the Kuomintang authorities strictly ordered the city defense troops and military police to conduct strict inspections at the city gates. All students above the secondary school level were not allowed to leave the city without special official documents.

　　The cost of living in Beiping is surprisingly high. A bag of flour sells for more than 30,000 to nearly 40,000 legal tender. Currently, due to the tense situation of the civil war, the rising trend is becoming more and more intense. Since the large-scale import and dumping of American goods, everything is American goods. Even breakfast has been replaced by American snacks instead of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks. For example, an American breakfast with a piece of bread, a sausage, a piece of coffee, and a cigarette costs only 200 yuan, while a breakfast of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks costs 500 yuan. American milk powder is also cheaper than soy milk. Therefore, a large number of people in Peiping who rely on selling sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and soy milk for a living also feel the serious crisis of unemployment. As for the influx of other commodities, it goes without saying. Just take a tour of Xidan Archway and Dong'an Market, and at a glance, what is displayed in the glass window showcases are all dumping products of Wall Street tycoons, which makes people involuntarily recall the troubling sun trademarks of 1935-37 and the era of Japanese rule, giving people unspeakable pain, shame, hatred, and anger!——Although American goods are so cheap, the purchasing power of ordinary citizens, except for the "guests" and "darlings" who "fly from the sky" and "crawl out of the ground," has dropped shockingly. They can hardly maintain the minimum standard of living, so how can they have the surplus to enjoy this modern "material civilization"? !

　　What complements the commodities of Wall Street tycoons are the Wall Street sailors who have come to China to "help send Japanese prisoners back home" on the main streets of Beiping! Especially in the Dongdan Wangfujing Street area, groups of "allied soldiers" often come out of the "bars" drunk, staggering, and gesticulating; or a "Jeep girl" is flanked by two "allied soldiers" who are rampaging around, as if no one else is around; or an "allied soldier" sits on a rickshaw or tricycle, embracing a "Jeep girl" and singing loudly, parading through the streets; or a Jeep carries "allied soldiers" and "Jeep girls," speeding and roaring past. These scenes make the citizens who live in the ancient capital shake their heads and retreat in time. Because they all know that ten years ago, the citizens of Peiping were disrespectful to the Eastern "friendly country," which caused the authorities to issue repeated orders to "promote good-neighborly relations" and arrest and kill young patriotic people! Today, they also know that Chairman Chiang, in order to treat the "allied soldiers" well, has ordered all provinces and cities to instruct the dancing girls that as long as they can do everything possible to eliminate the "allied soldiers'" homesickness in China, it will be their great "contribution" and "offering" to the country and the nation!

　　Although the Kuomintang government, including that Chairman Chiang, treats the "allied soldiers" so well, the "allied soldiers" show great disrespect to this chairman. When the "recovery" of Peiping and Tianjin began, each cinema first showed a picture of this chairman when the screening began, asking the audience to stand up to pay tribute to the "leader" and sing the party song. So someone kindly suggested: "This is a fascist set, why do we still want it today?!" The responsible persons of the Kuomintang party and government in Peiping and Tianjin replied: "This is because the concept of the motherland has faded for the citizens of Peiping and Tianjin in the past eight years, and today we must strengthen their impression of the motherland." Later, more and more "allied soldiers" came, and of course there were many traces of "allied soldiers" in the cinemas. However, whenever the citizens were forced to stand up, pay tribute to the "leader" image, and sing the party song, the "allied soldiers" not only did not stand up very impolitely, but also laughed wildly and whistled, making "hiss...hiss...hiss" sounds; some righteous American friends also shouted, "Hey! Look! The picture of the civil war leader!" This made the Peiping and Tianjin authorities very headache, so later they had no choice but to cancel it. The citizens of Peiping are discussing such events, namely: ten years ago, the Eastern "friendly country" drove away the Kuomintang's Hebei Provincial Party Department, government, and garrison. Today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Western "allied soldiers" scared away the Kuomintang's leader image and party song in the cinema!

　　When the news that the US military was constantly assisting the Kuomintang army in attacking the Liberated Areas reached Peiping and Tianjin, American democratic friends in Peiping and Tianjin said: "The Communist Party says too much, why not kill a few American accomplices?! Only in this way can the reactionary policies of the US government be thoroughly understood by the vast number of American people, and then it will be more effective to urge the withdrawal of the US military stationed in China, and then it will be more effective to promote the change of the US reactionary aid-China policy!"

　　The citizens of Peiping are sighing and indignant today! Their latent power is brewing, and sooner or later it will be like a bomb. I don't know when it will explode with a blazing spark!

　　来客话北平
    最近北平市有三忙：第一是筑碉堡忙，平市当局他们白天见鬼地在重要的大街、小巷遍筑街头堡垒，并散布谣言说：八路军要攻城，一时人心惶惶，特别恐慌的是那批“飞来客”，他们原来住在堂皇富丽的大机关里，现在都纷纷搬出来住到“接收”过来的民房，据说这样能保险些。第二是贪污忙，这一批大大小小的“飞来客”都成天价忙于如何争赃发财，进行“五子登科”的活动。因此，也带给了平市各饭馆、戏院、舞厅、电影院、八大胡同等以一番“歌舞升平”的“繁华景象”。第三是特务宪警的抓人忙，他们到处忙于逮捕进步青年、民主人士，最近秘密警察大事搜捕的恐怖空气，较之一九三三年蒋孝先宪兵三团及日寇统治时代，远有过之而无不及。
    自从国民政府“收复”平津后，南京教育部曾明令规定：自一九三七年以后，所有各级学校毕业生、肄业生、教员、教授，一律冠以伪字头衔，全部进行甄别考试。这一葫芦里藏的另一剂药，实际是用借口一方面清洗进步分子，另一方面乘机大肆发展三青团及特务组织，从而也就得到镇压平津学生青年爱国反内战活动的效果。一时各校内舆论界大哗，群起反对。朱家骅始终命令坚持贯彻，不为所动。不久，北平工学院一批教授、学生共计六十余人，痛心国民党当局的黑暗统治，相率逃往张家口，备受解放区民主政府以及青年、教育界的热烈欢迎。这一消息传到平市，哄动青年界，一时逃者络绎不绝。这也震憾了国民党法西斯对青年的统治，于是不得不暂告缓期，这一问题始终尚是一个悬案未曾解决。而另一面国民党当局却严令城防部队、宪警，在各城门口严加检查，凡属中等以上学校学生，如无官方特殊证件，一律不许出城。
    北平生活程度奇昂，一袋面粉卖到三万多将近四万法币，目前由于内战形势紧张，涨风日炽。自从美货大批进口倾销后，无物不是美货，甚至早点也都以美国点心代替了烧饼油条，如一包装有面包一块、香肠一根，咖啡一块，香烟一支的美国早点，价不过二百元，而一顿烧饼油条的早点则需五百元，美国的奶粉也比豆浆便宜。因此，平市大批依靠卖烧饼油条豆浆为生的也感到失业的严重危机。至于其它商品的充斥就更勿论了，只要到西单牌楼、东安市场巡视一周，举目一看，玻璃窗橱理所陈列的，莫不是花旗大亨们的倾销品，使人不由得回忆起一九三五——三七、以及日寇统治时期令人头痛的太阳商标，令人有说不出的苦痛、耻辱、憎恶、激忿的感触！——虽然美货如此便宜，然而大批主顾除却“天上飞来”的和“地下爬出”的“贵客”“骄子”之流，一般市民的购买力是下降得可惊，他们连最低限度的生活都难得维持，怎会有余力来从事享受这现代的“物质文明”呢？！
    和花旗大亨们商品相映媲美的是来华“帮助遣送日俘回国”的花旗水兵们，在北平的大街通衢！特别在东单王府井大街一带，成群结伙的“盟军”，经常从“酒吧”间出来喝得醉醺醺地、东倒西歪，手舞足蹈；或者一个“吉普女郎”左右挟着两个“盟军”横冲直撞、旁若无人；或者一辆人力车或三轮车上坐着一位“盟军”，怀中拥抱着一个“吉普女郎”引吭高歌，招摇过市；或者一辆吉普车载着“盟军”和“吉普女郎”，风驰电掣、猛啸而过。这些景象，使得那些居住在古老故都里的市民们，个个都摇头乍手退避不暇。因为他们都知道：过去十年前，北平市民因为对东方“友邦”的不敬，致使当局三令五申地颁令“敦睦邦交”，捕杀青年爱国志士！今天，他们也都知道：蒋主席为了要善待“盟军”，曾命令各省市要转饬舞女们，只要他们能用尽一切方法消弭“盟军”在华的思乡之情，便是她们对国家民族莫大的“功劳”与“供献”了！
    国民党政府连同那位蒋主席在内，虽然这样优待“盟军”，而“盟军”表现的对这位主席却很不敬。当开始“收复”平津后，各电影院每当放映开始时，首先放映出这位主席的像片，要观众们起立对“领袖”致敬并唱党歌。于是有人善意地建议说：“这是法西斯的一套，我们今天为什么还要它呢？！”平津国民党党政负责人答复是：“这是因为平津市民八年来对祖国的观念淡漠了，今天必须要加强他们对祖国的印象。”后来“盟军”们陆续来多了，电影院当然也少不了“盟军”们的踪迹，可是，每当市民们被迫起立，向那位“领袖”像致敬和唱党歌时，“盟军”们便很不客气地不但不站起来，而且狂笑呼哨发出“嘘…嘘…嘘”的声音；另一些正义的美国朋友们也喊“喂！看！内战领袖的像！”这样一来，使得平津当局很头痛，于是后来不得已，只有取消之一途了。北平市民们都在议论这样的事件，即：十年前东方“友邦”赶走了国民党的河北省党部、政府、驻军，抗战胜利后的今天，西方“盟军”在电影院吓走了国民党的领袖像和党歌！
    当美军不断协助国民党军进攻解放区的消息传到平津时，平津的美国民主朋友们说：“共产党说得太多了，为什么不打死几个美国的帮凶者？！只有这样美国政府的反动政策，才会为美国广大的人民认识透彻，那时才会对督促驻华美军的撤退更加有力，那时才会对促使美国反动的援华政策的改变更加有力！”
    北平的市民们今天在叹息、在激忿！他们的潜在的力量在酝酿着，早晚会像一颗炸弹，不知什么时候，它会爆发出爆烈的火花来的！
