　　Improve Our News Agency and Newspaper
    *Jiefang Ribao* September 1 Editorial

    September 1st, Journalist's Day, should be a day for news workers in the Liberated Areas to review, summarize their work, improve their own qualities, and improve their news operations.

    During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the news undertakings in the Liberated Areas have achieved brilliant successes. We created and implemented the principle of "combining with reality and combining with the masses" in running newspapers, made significant contributions to the people's War of Resistance Against Japan, and at the same time, made our newspapers in the Liberated Areas take on a new look, very different from old-style newspapers, adding a unique color to the history of Chinese journalism. We have cultivated a group of excellent, new-type young news fighters, and we have accumulated a lot of experience, learning how to run newspapers in rural areas, in war environments, and under extremely difficult material conditions. Precisely because of these achievements and foundations, once Japan was defeated, news organizations could be quickly established and people's newspapers published and distributed in all cities liberated by the people's army and the people's forces. Moreover, due to the growth of the people's strength, our news work has now occupied a very important position in the national political life, constantly influencing the evolution of the Chinese situation and influencing the trends of world opinion. This is a great development of the people's news undertakings, and we celebrate this development; but at the same time, we should see that precisely because this development is very rapid, precisely because we are rapidly facing a vast new environment, a large number of new things, and complex new problems, we must also rapidly improve our work intensity and work quality, and not limit ourselves to the achievements of the past.

    First, let's look at the work of our news agency. The news agency is the most important weapon for the Liberated Areas to conduct a nationwide propaganda struggle against the reactionaries today, and it is the most important weapon for enabling the people of the entire Liberated Areas to understand the world situation, the national situation, and the dynamics of the entire Liberated Areas every day. However, not only because of the difficulties of our material conditions and transportation conditions, but also because of our subjective lack of understanding and experience in this work, many people only regard it as a simple appendage of the newspaper, so that our communication situation still has serious weaknesses. Here, without mentioning various technical issues, we only put forward the basic requirements of current communication work, which is to achieve speed, accuracy, and clarity in the content of communications. Speed and accuracy are the lifeline of today's intense propaganda struggle, and it is precisely in these two aspects that our human and material resources give us the greatest objective limitations. Due to our lack of sufficient telecommunications equipment and a widespread communication network, and due to the inconvenience and even isolation of transportation, we often report on certain urgent events slowly, and sometimes there is a certain degree of generality. Under the conditions that the reactionaries continue the civil war policy: it is impossible to completely eliminate this weakness, but the party, government, military, and civilian organizations in the Liberated Areas, as well as the news agency organization itself, must still cooperate in every possible way to seek the maximum speed and accuracy of our news communication (when speed and accuracy cannot be achieved at the same time, the communication we send out should take a form of cautious reservation, so as to continue to supplement more accurate reports), and absolutely no sloppy attitude is allowed. It must be known that this is extremely important for the entire political struggle and must be taken seriously. After achieving speed and accuracy, in order to facilitate the acceptance of the vast number of readers, we must also strive for clarity. This means that in the most economical text, we must also be able to be specific, vivid, systematic, and complete, and never forget that every news communication you write is for those who are the least clear, not for those who are the most clear. Therefore, each time, use all methods to make the events that you think are the clearest understood by those who are the least clear, just as we understand some things we have never heard of or are extremely unfamiliar with from foreign telegrams. This becomes another work discipline for us. We should honestly admit that we now often regard the telegrams needed by the news agency and the local news communications of the newspaper as one thing, and regard the characters, places, facts, names, and concepts that we are familiar with and remember as facts that readers are already familiar with or often remember. These are not only difficult to understand and remember for foreigners and people outside the Liberated Areas, but also for people in another place within the Liberated Areas, without the necessary introduction. Although we have some achievements in reporting on typical examples, generally speaking, we are not good at obtaining typical examples and reporting them vividly. What we are most unfamiliar with and least skilled in is how to use concise text to not only give a bird's-eye view of the entire outline, but also intersperse with typical examples and vivid pictures to give readers a deep impression. Therefore, our telegrams are sometimes still vague, empty, or dry. We often do not completely use concise text to not only explain the process of a certain event, but also set off the historical and environmental picture, and compare before and after, left and right, positive and negative, and use the narrative of facts instead of discussion to point out its significance and influence, making it more prominent; we are not good at organizing reports that are interconnected and continuous before and after, so that the entire news has cause and effect, beginning and end. These "technical" issues are all related to the success or failure of the political struggle and should never be taken lightly. In these areas, we must humbly learn, constantly review the effectiveness of our work, and often observe the works of advanced foreign news agencies and reporters, learning their mature skills like elementary school students.

    Our newspaper work has a longer history, but there are also places where we cannot fully adapt to and correctly adapt to the new environment. The main shortcoming is that the connection between newspapers in some places and the local masses still seems weak. Some newspapers that have entered new Liberated Areas from old Liberated Areas, and have entered cities from rural areas, have not yet established good connections with the new masses due to various reasons, and the hard-won establishment of news positions in the past has also been relaxed. In this way, these few newspapers are not fully in line with the needs of the urban masses (which are not entirely the same as the needs of the rural areas in specific programs, although they need the same mass line), and the reflection of the activities of the rural masses is also unsatisfactory. In individual cases, even in form, they only know how to enthusiastically expand the layout and imitate extravagantly, and the content mainly relies on communications, regardless of whether these forms and content are needed or appropriate locally. In short, they do not put the needs of the local masses and work first, and do not organize, tailor, and arrange news articles, essays, and even supplementary publications according to the standards of their needs, thus greatly reducing the role of the newspaper in guiding work and mobilizing the masses. Due to insufficient contact with work and the masses, the serious responsibility of self-criticism of the newspaper is even more significantly neglected. Although these tendencies are partial and temporary, and therefore easy to correct, they must be corrected quickly.

    Strengthening business contact with the masses is the central task at present, and to achieve this task, we must start by strengthening the importance and leadership of news work, strengthening the training of cadres, and summarizing experience. The main cadres at all levels of the Party must fully understand the paramount importance of today's news agency work and newspaper work in our entire revolutionary cause, personally understand the actual situation of our news agencies and newspapers, overcome existing shortcomings, and help solve their difficulties. Although the lineup of our news cadres is much larger than before, due to the rapid development of the business, it is still insufficient in quantity, and the improvement of quality is even more urgent. This situation is particularly noticeable in news agencies. Therefore, the allocation, training, and care of news cadres should be one of the important tasks of cadre work and cadre education work. News work is an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause and requires a whole batch of fighters to engage in it for life. It should be recognized that the revolutionary news undertaking is one of the most glorious undertakings to serve the people. Aspire to bury yourself in the study of your profession in order to become proficient and proficient, do not be fickle and give up halfway. As for summarizing experience, this is the best way to train cadres and improve business. The history of our news work is not too short, and there is already a lot of experience. What is needed is to be good at regular summary and to organize, sort out, and promote the insights and creations gained from the summary. We already have a fairly solid position and have established a broad influence at home and abroad. As long as we uphold the glorious tradition of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs Bo Gu, Yang Song, and He Yun, and constantly strive for progress, we will surely achieve greater victories.

　　改进我们的通讯社和报纸
    解放日报九一社论
    九一记者节，对于解放区的新闻工作者应该是个检讨总结工作提高自身修养改进新闻业务的日子。
    在八年抗战中，解放区的新闻事业已有光辉的成就，我们创造了和执行了“与实际结合与群众结合”的办报方针，对于人民抗日战争作了重大的贡献，同时也使我们解放区的报纸面貌一新与旧式的报纸大相异趣，在中国新闻史上放一异彩。我们培养了一批优秀的新型的青年新闻战士，我们积蓄了许多经验，学会如何在农村、在战争环境中、在极端困难的物质条件下办报。正因有这些成就和基础，所以一旦日本被打垮，凡是人民军队人民力量所解放的城市，都能迅速建立新闻机构，出版发行人民的报纸。而且由于人民力量的生长，现在我们的新闻工作已经在全国政治生活中占了十分重要的地位，经常影响着中国时局的演变，影响着世界舆论的动向了。这是人民的新闻事业的一个伟大的发展，我们庆祝这个发展；但是同时应当看到：正因为这个发展非常迅速，正因为我们迅速地面对着广阔的新环境、大量的新事物、复杂的新问题，我们就必须同样迅速地提高我们的工作强度和工作质量，而不能自限于过去时期的成就。
    首先看我们的通讯社工作。通讯社是解放区今天与反动派作全国范围的宣传斗争的最重要武器，是使全解放区人民每天了解世界动态全国动态和全解放区动态的最重要武器，但是不仅由于我们的物质条件交通条件的困难，而且由于我们主观上对于这项工作的认识与经验的不足，很多人只当它是报纸的简单附属物，以至我们的通讯情形还存在着严重的弱点。这里不说各种技术上的问题，只提出目前通讯工作的基本要求，这就是要做到通讯内容的迅速准确和明了。迅速和准确是今天紧张的宣传斗争的生命线，而正在这两方面我们的人力物力给我们客观的限制最大。由于我们缺乏充分的电讯设备和普遍的通讯网，由于交通的不便甚至隔绝，我们对于某些紧急的事件往往报导得迟缓，有时还有某种程度的笼统。在反动派继续内战政策的条件下：完全消灭这种弱点也是不可能的，但是解放区的党政军民组织以及通讯社组织本身，仍然必须尽一切可能通力合作，来求得我们的新闻通讯的最大限度的迅速和准确（在迅速和准确不可得兼的时候，我们发出的通讯就应当采取某种谨慎的保留的形式，以便继续补充更准确的报导），绝对不能允许任何的马虎态度。须知这对于整个政治斗争是异常重要的，是必须采取严肃态度的。做到了迅速和准确以后，为了便于广大读者的接受，还要力求明了。这就是说在最经济的文字中还要能够做到具体生动系统完整，永远不要忘记你所写的每一个新闻通讯都是为了那些最不明了的人而不是为了那些最明了的人。因此每一次都用一切方法使你们所觉得最明了的事件能被那些最不明了的人所明了，正如我们从外国的电讯中明了一些我们前所未闻的或极不熟悉的事物一般。这就成为我们的另一个工作纪律。应该老实承认：我们现在还往往把通讯社所需要的电讯和报纸的本地新闻通讯看作一件事，把我们自己所熟悉的所记得的人物地点事实名称观念当做读者也是已经熟悉的或常常记得的事实。这些不但对于外国人对于解放区以外的人，而且对于解放区内另一个地方的人，如果没有必要的介绍，一切都是很难明了很难记得的。我们对于报导典型虽有若干成就，但一般地说，我们还不善于获取典型和生动地报导出来，对我们最生疏的和最不熟练的就是怎样用简洁的文字不但鸟瞰出整个的轮廓、而且穿插以典型的事例生动的图景，给读者一个深刻的印象。因此我们的电讯有时还是若明若暗、空泛或是枯燥，我们还往往不完全用简洁的文字不但说明某一事件的经过、而且衬出历史和环境的图景，进行前后左右正反的比照，用事实的叙述而不是用议论来点破它的意义影响，使它更加突出；我们还不善于组织彼此互相联系、前后互相连续的报导，使整个新闻有因有果有始有终。这些“技术”上的问题，都关系于政治斗争的得失，决不应该轻视。在这些方面，我们必须虚心学习，经常检讨工作的效果，并且经常观摩外国先进的通讯社和记者的作品，像小学生一样学习它们成熟的技巧。
    我们的报纸工作历史比较久，但对于新的环境也有不能充分适应和正确适应的地方，主要的缺点是某些地方的报纸对于本地群众的联系还显得薄弱。由老解放区进入新解放区、由乡村进入城市的某些报纸，由于种种原因，对于新的群众还没有很好的联系，而旧的辛勤建立新闻阵地也松懈了。这样，这些少数报纸对于城市群众的需要（在具体的节目上这是与农村的需要不尽相同的，虽然需要同一的群众路线）固然不完全符合，对于农村群众活动的反映也是不能令人满意。在个别的情形，甚至在形式上只知热中于扩大版面铺张模仿，内容则主要依靠通讯，而不管这些形式和内容在本地是否需要、是否适宜。总之，是不把本地群众的和工作的需要放在第一位，不以本他需要的标准来组织剪裁和排列新闻论文以至副刊的稿件，因而使报纸指导工作动员群众的作用受到很大的损失。由于和工作与群众的联系不足，报纸的自我批评的严重责任更受到显著的忽视。这些倾向虽然是部分的暂时的，因此是容易纠正的，但是是必须迅速纠正的。
    加强业务联系群众，这是当前中心课题，而要实现这个课题，必须从加强对新闻工作的重视和领导，加强培养干部和总结经验入手。党的各级主要干部必须充分了解今天通讯社工作和报纸工作在我们整个革命事业中的头等重要意义，亲自了解我们通讯社和报纸的实际状况，克服现存的缺点，帮助解决它们的困难。我们的新闻干部的阵容虽比以前壮大得多，但因业务一日千里的发展，在数量上仍还不足，而质量的提高更为当务之急，这个情形在通讯社方面尤其显著。所以把新闻干部的配备培养训练和爱护应该是干部工作和干部教育工作的重要任务之一。新闻工作是革命事业不可缺少的一部分，需要有一整批的战士终身从事。应该认识到革命的新闻事业是为人民服务的，最光荣事业之一，立志埋头钻研业务，以求熟练和精通，不要见异思迁，一曝十寒。至于总结经验，这是培养干部提高业务的最好途径，我们的新闻工作历史已不太短，经验也已经不少，所需要的就是善于经常的总结，并将总结所得的心得和创造加以整理推广。我们已经有了相当巩固的阵地，在国内外已经建立了广大的影响，只要我们秉承博古、杨松、何云诸先烈牺牲奋斗的光荣传统，不断的力求进步，我们就一定会得到更伟大的胜利。
