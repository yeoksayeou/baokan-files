　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese seamen's strike has continued for eight days, seriously affecting the supply of coal to Honshu. Because all sea transport to the coal-producing area of Kyushu has been halted, many factories are in danger of shutting down due to the cutoff of coal supplies. City lighting has also been affected, and train services have been reduced. The internal struggle within the union remains intense. Although the anti-strike faction led by the right wing of the Socialist Party has been driven out of the leadership by the rank and file members, they are still carrying out divisions among the members, inciting disputes over the number and qualifications of representatives sent to negotiate. In order to ease the seamen's strike, the authorities have released the arrested union cadres.

　　海员工潮持续日本燃煤匮乏
    【新华社延安十九日电】东京讯：日本海员罢工已持续八天，严重的影响本州煤炭的供应，因为通达九州产煤区的海运全部停顿，许多工厂因煤炭供应断绝而停工之虞，市区电灯亦受影响，火车已减少班次。工会内部的斗争依然剧烈，社会党右派领导的反罢工派虽为会员群众驱出领导机构，但仍在会员中进行分化，煽起工会对派去谈判的代表名额与资格的争论。当局为缓和海员罢工，已将被捕工会干部释放。
