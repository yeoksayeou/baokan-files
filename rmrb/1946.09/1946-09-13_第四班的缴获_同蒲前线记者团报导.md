　　The Fourth Squad climbed the Zhao City wall. From there, they could see the east gate under intense fire. In the blaze, the bunkers on the city wall fell one by one. The Fourth Squad disregarded the situation at the east gate, their task was to quickly advance westward along the city wall to meet up with a certain unit at the west gate. A dozen or so men spread out, rushing forward; every few steps, they encountered a bunker – some large, some small, some exposed, some hidden. The Fourth Squad dealt with them one by one, using grenades to finish them off. They advanced, with explosions erupting along the way. Flashes of red light guided them forward, all the way to the second large bunker, then the third. The enemy inside charged out, but they were quickly subdued with more grenades. They passed the fourth large bunker.

　　On the city wall, over sixty men were running away in a disarray, losing their American helmets, tattered shoes, grenades, and rifles. Some tripped over stones, others fell off the city wall. The Fourth Squad pursued them, shouting, "Take them alive! Take them alive!"

　　A sound came from the courtyard, and someone shouted, "Surrender your weapons! Surrender your weapons!" Light machine guns and rifles were handed over, followed by sixty men. In total, they captured four light machine guns and twenty rifles. The Fourth Squad handed over the men and weapons to the machine gun squad and continued to advance westward. Having run out of grenades, they used the enemy's. At this moment, a large crowd of people was gathered on the river outside the city. They gave chase, and the people in front fled into a large courtyard with "Military Supply Depot" written on the gate, which was tightly closed, as if preparing to defend it to the death. The Fourth Squad changed their approach and stopped using grenades, as it would be difficult to capture it quickly. They began to shout.

　　"Hey! Your people have all run away! Surrender your weapons!"

　　"Surrender and you will not be killed!"

　　"We are here to relieve the suffering of the people, and you are just poor people who have been conscripted!" The Fourth Squad then threw over a dozen grenades. Unit XX on the west bank of the river also provided covering fire, and the enemy was trapped, scattering in all directions. Amidst the sound of the Fen River and the braying of mules, the Fourth Squad rushed over and captured a mortar, twenty rifles, and twenty mules.

　　第四班的缴获
    同蒲前线记者团报导
    第四班登上赵城城墙，这时可以看到东门正处在激烈的炮火中，在火光中城墙上的碉堡一个个倒下去，现在第四班不管东门的情况，要迅速的沿城墙向西推进，到达西门与某某部会合，这时十来个人分散着，冲过十几步就是一个碉堡，有大的，小的，明的，暗的，第四班对付的办法是有一个解决一个，用手榴弹结束它。他们一路走，一路上有爆炸声，闪闪的红光引着他们前进，一直行到第二个大碉堡到第三个大碉堡，里面的敌人向外冲锋，但也只是多用几颗手榴弹来结束了他，又走过第四个大碉堡。
    在城墙上，前面有六十多个人狼狈的跑着，掉了美国大盖帽，掉了烂鞋子，掉了手榴弹，掉了枪枝，有的被石头绊倒，有的跌下城墙，在后面追着的就是第四班喊着：“捉活的！捉活的！”
    院子里传出一阵响声，有人喊着“缴枪！缴枪！”送来了轻机枪步枪，随后走出来了六十个人，共有轻机枪四挺，步枪二十枝。第四班把人枪交给机枪班，又向西推进，没有手榴弹了，就拿人家的使用。这时城外河上聚着黑压压的一大堆人，追了上去前面的人钻在一个大院子内，门上写着军需处，门关的紧紧的，好像准备死守。第四班就改变了办法，不再用手榴弹，因为一时不易攻下来。组织喊话。
    “喂！你们的人都跑了！缴枪吧！”
    “缴枪不杀！”
    “我们是为老百姓解除痛苦，你们不是被抓来的穷人！”第四班就抛下十几颗手榴弹去。河西的××部也用火力堵击着，这时敌人像放在夹板中的人，四处奔逃。一片汾河的水声，骡子的叫声，第四班冲过去，又缴获了迫击炮一门，步枪二十支，骡子二十头。
