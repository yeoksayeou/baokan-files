　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 5th—The Military Mediation Department's Group 25, accompanied by five reporters from various parties, flew from Ping (Beijing) to Zhangjiakou via special plane at 9:30 AM on the 3rd. At 5:00 PM, they met with General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the CCP’s Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, at the reception office of the Border Region Administrative Committee. General Nie expressed his hope that the Anping Incident would be resolved quickly and reasonably, and especially hoped that similar incidents would not occur in the future. General Nie refuted the Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) faction's slander that the Anping Incident was a planned and instigated action by the Communist Party to provoke the relationship between the United States and the CCP, and their despicable attempt to drag the United States into directly participating in the civil war. He stated: Although we firmly demand that the US military stationed in China immediately withdraw from China after completing their prisoner-of-war repatriation mission, and demand that the US government cease its erroneous policy of fueling the Chinese civil war, this does not equate to opposing the American people and soldiers. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Jidong (Eastern Hebei) liberated area rescued a large number of American airmen who had crashed, and paid a heavy price for this. We deeply cherish the friendship of the American people who once fought side by side against the Axis powers. Regarding the materials provided by the Supply Group concerning the Anping Incident, General Nie stated: Since the ceasefire on January 13th, the Communist army has never taken offensive actions. Anping Town is part of the Jidong liberated area, which was recovered by the Communist army after the Japanese surrender. Although there have been multiple conflicts due to the Jiang army's offensive in the area after the ceasefire. At this point, US representative Davis stood up and said: He was very grateful for General Nie Rongzhen's sincere remarks; he believed even more that the CCP's cherishing of the friendship with the American people was beyond any doubt.

　　聂荣臻将军表示
    安平事件应迅速合理解决
    廿五小组飞张访聂氏
    【新华社张家口五日电】军调部第二十五小组偕同各方记者五人于三日上午九时半由平专机飞张，下午五时与中共晋察冀军区司令员聂荣臻将军会见于边区行政委员会交际处。聂将军表示希望安平事件迅予合理解决，尤望今后不再发生同类事件。聂将军对蒋方诬称安平事件为中共有计划策动，图挑拨美国与中共关系，与拖拉美国直接参加内战的卑劣企图，予以驳斥。并称：虽然我们坚决要求驻华美军于遣俘任务完成后立即撤离中国，要求美政府停止助长中国内战错误政策；但这决不等于反对美国人民和士兵。抗战期间我冀东解放区救护失事的美军飞行人员极众，并为此付出过重大的牺牲代价。我们是十分珍重曾经并肩反抗暴日的美国人民的友谊的。对供给小组有关安平事件材料，聂将军称：自一月十三日停战后，中共军队从未采取进攻行动。安平镇系冀东解放区之一部分，日寇投降后为中共军队所光复。虽然停战后由于蒋军进攻该地，曾经发生冲突多起。至此，美代表戴维斯即起立称：他对聂荣臻将军诚恳的致词甚为感激；中共珍重与美国人民之间的友谊，他更相信是任何人所不能怀疑的。
