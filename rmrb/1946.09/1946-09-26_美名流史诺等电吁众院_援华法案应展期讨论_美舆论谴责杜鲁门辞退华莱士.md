　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 23rd: New York Airmail: On July 3rd, twelve American celebrities jointly telegraphed House Majority Leader McCormack, urging him to postpone discussion of the Military Aid to China Bill until Congress reconvenes next year. The telegram condemned: If this bill is hastily passed before Congress adjourns, it will be a disaster for China and may also be a disaster for world peace. They listed the reasons for opposing the bill as follows: (1) This bill violates President Truman's statement of December 15, 1945. (2) The majority of the Chinese people believe that this bill will fuel the Chinese civil war, so they all oppose it. The civil war in that country is detrimental to American commerce. (3) This bill is, in effect, an invasion of China's sovereignty, as it not only makes the American president the commander of the Chinese army, but also makes the Chinese army dependent on the American arms industry. (4) This bill will give the American president unprecedented peacetime power over American Far East policy for the next ten years. (5) This bill is a unilateral exercise of the powers of the United Nations by the United States, and the United Nations has not stipulated aid to China in its Charter. The signatories include famous journalist Snow and his wife, American church leaders MacMillin and Fillebrown, American Women's Congress Vice-Chairman Triplett, labor leader Wright, Nation magazine editor Stewart, journalist Forman, and writer Field, etc. Note: The American Military Aid to China Bill has not been passed, and the American Congress has now adjourned and will reconvene early next year.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 23rd: United Press, New York, September 22nd: American progressives and public opinion are commenting on Truman's dismissal of Wallace. Democratic progressive Congressman DeLacy stated: Wallace correctly and forthrightly attacked Vandenberg and Hoover's plan, which would make the United States an aggressor and plunge it into war. The New York area committee of the American Veterans Committee believes that Truman's action has brought the United States closer to a third world war. The Chicago Daily News stated: "Wallace is temporarily silenced, but probably not forever." The Chicago Sun stated: Although Mr. Wallace has been rejected by the president, who expressed his approval of him a week ago, his influence cannot be ignored and may still affect current foreign policy, as this issue has aroused widespread debate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated: Wallace may continue to intervene in our country's foreign affairs, but in the capacity of a private citizen.

　　美名流史诺等电吁众院
　　援华法案应展期讨论
　　美舆论谴责杜鲁门辞退华莱士
    【新华社延安二十三日电】纽约航讯：七月三日，十二位美国名流联名致电众院多数党领袖麦考马克，促其将军事援华法案，延至明年国会重开时再讨论。电文中谴责谓：此法案若在国会休会前仓卒通过，将系中国之灾祸，且可能亦系世界和平之灾祸。他们列举反对法案之理由如下：（一）此法案违反杜鲁门总统于一九四五年十二月十五日的声明。（二）大多数中国人民认为此法案将助长中国内战，故皆反对之。该国之内战对美国商业无益。（三）此法案乃实际上侵略中国之主权，因此举不仅使美国总统成为中国军队之统帅，且中国军队将依赖于美国之军火工业。（四）此法案将赋予美国总统在今后十年内对美国远东政策以史无前例的和平时期的大权。（五）此法案乃美国擅行联合国之权力，而联合国并未于其宪章中规定对中国之援助。签名者有名记者史诺及其夫人、美教会领袖麦克米契尔及菲利车曼、美国妇女大会副主席特列伯、劳工领袖莱特、民族杂志编辑史蒂华特、新闻记者福尔曼、作家菲尔特等。按：美国军事援华法案未通过，美国会现已休会，将至明年初再开。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】合众社纽约二十二日讯：美国进步人士与舆论，纷纷评论杜鲁门辞退华莱士。民主党进步议员德拉西称：华莱士正确地硬直地抨击范登堡、胡佛的计划，这一计划使美国成为侵略者而投入战争中。美国退伍军人委员会纽约区委员会认为杜鲁门的行动，使美国更接近了第三次大战。芝加哥日报称：“华莱士暂时是沉默了，但可能不会永远如此。”芝加哥太阳报称：华氏虽被一周前对他表示赞同的总统所排斥，可是他的影响远不能忽视，还可能影响目前的外交政策，因为这问题已引起广泛争论。西稚图邮讯报称：华莱士可能继续干预我国外交，但是以公民私人的资格。
