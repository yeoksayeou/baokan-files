　　[This newspaper, Weixian, 27th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war flames have threatened the safety of the eight million people of Jinnan. To crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war, the Military Commission Headquarters urgently calls on military commissions at all levels and 200,000 militiamen and one million self-defense team members throughout the region to take immediate action! (1) Military commissions at all levels must immediately become tense, overcome paralysis and slackness, promote the spirit of hard struggle during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, deeply mobilize the masses, greatly develop the militia, and tighten belts to support the front lines. (2) Militiamen and self-defense team members must promote the glorious tradition of heroic fighting during the Anti-Japanese War. In today's patriotic self-defense war, in addition to actively participating in the war, they must actively join the regular army. Excellent village cadres and squad leaders should set an example, organize and lead militiamen and self-defense team members to collectively join the army and strengthen the people's army. (3) Chiang Kai-shek is driving special agents to cooperate with his military offensive and is active in our rear. The militia should act as the backbone to lead the self-defense forces, step up sentry joint defense, protect transportation, suppress special agent activities, and stabilize social order. (4) It is necessary to actively produce, give preferential treatment to military families, and ensure that the soldiers at the front have food to eat and clothes to wear, that there are no difficulties at home, and that they are not burdened by their families, so they can fight with peace of mind, defend their homes, and defend the good times after liberation.
