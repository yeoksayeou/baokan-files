　　May Every Family Celebrate a Reunion on Mid-Autumn Festival
    We Cheerfully Escort the Prisoners of War on the Tongpu Front
    Yan's Prisoners Recall the Past Before Departure, Weeping and Refusing to be Ghosts of the Civil War
    [Our newspaper Yangcheng 9th dispatch] As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, the Eighth Route Army on the Tongpu front specially released the first batch of 2,000 Yan Army soldiers captured in the Tongpu Campaign early, before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The prisoner-of-war officer reception center had already sent off a group of lower-ranking officers on the 5th, including Su Yaocheng, a staff member of the machine gun company of the 2nd Battalion of the 265th Regiment of the 69th Division, Bao Junde, platoon leader of the 9th Company of the 39th Division, Lin Shiming, platoon deputy of the 4th Company of the 44th Division, Tian Xigeng, platoon leader of the 2nd Company, and other Yan Army officers and soldiers. They thanked the Eighth Route Army for allowing them to return to their hometowns to enjoy the joy of reunion with their families on the Mid-Autumn Festival. Su Yaocheng recalled that when he was driven by Yan Xishan to Lu'an to fight the civil war last year, Yan Xishan gave them each a catty of wheat for the Mid-Autumn Festival, which could only be ground into twelve taels of flour, not enough for a dumpling meal. The entire company of seventy or eighty people was given one mooncake a month, not even enough for a bite each, and many people collapsed on the kang and cried bitterly at the time. Su Yaocheng's words reminded many Yan soldiers of their homes and how they had spent the Mid-Autumn Festival in the past. Su Jingcai, a 57-year-old man, interjected: "I am from Suiyuan, and my family of five was drafted by Yan Xishan, causing our family to be separated, and we don't know whether they are dead or alive..." Li Shiming spent the Mid-Autumn Festival in Huo County last year, and he thought of his family and cried for a whole day. Finally, Shen Jincheng said: "May the Eighth Route Army win more battles and liberate more of our brothers so that they can also reunite with their families early." ...

　　愿家家中秋庆团圆
    同蒲前线我欢送俘虏
    阎俘临行忆当年，痛哭拒作内战鬼
    【本报阳城九日电】中秋节降临，同蒲前线八路军特将同蒲战役所俘获之第一批阎军士兵二千名，提早于中秋佳节前欢送回家。俘虏军官收容所曾于五日欢送一批下级军官，计有六十九师二六五团二营机枪连工作员苏耀成，卅九师九连排长鲍俊德，四十四师四连排副林士明，二连排长田西庚等阎军官兵，他们感谢八路军让返回故乡，赶上中秋节与家人重新团圆之乐。苏耀成忆及彼去年被阎锡山驱使到潞安打内战，过中秋时，阎锡山给他们每人发一斤麦子，只磨十二两面，不够吃一顿饺子，全连七八十人发一个月饼，一个人一口也不够咬，有好多人当时倒在炕上痛哭。苏耀成这一段话引起好多阎军想起家来，想起以往的中秋节怎样过的，五十七岁老汉苏景才插嘴说：“我是绥远人，一家五口，被阎锡山拉兵，弄得骨肉分离，死活不知……。”李士明去年在霍县城过的中秋，想起家里人整整哭了一天。最后申金成说：“愿八路军多打几个胜仗，多解放些我们的弟兄，使他们也能与家人早获团圆。”……
