　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin are filled with reports exposing corruption by Kuomintang officials, ranging from tens of millions to tens of thousands of yuan. Most of these cases are uncovered by the local people, but once they reach the government, they often "sink without a trace." Wang Xijun, the director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau, and five staff members, including Luo Chengde, concealed the original inventory of received materials and sold large quantities of goods, worth hundreds of millions of yuan. Zhang Yuping, the leader of the receiving team of the Beijing Public Works Bureau, embezzled over 150 tons of scrap iron, over 600 bags of cement, and over 2 million yuan in cash. Wu Dang, the chief of the South Suburb Police Bureau in Beijing, accepted bribes of up to 14 million yuan while investigating the property of traitors. A certain Consultant Zhou of the Kuomintang's Shandong Provincial Capital received three units, including the Japanese-owned Miyaring Trading Company, totaling tens of billions of yuan, but only reported 50 million yuan. Fang Yinzhi, the mayor of Yingkou, and others sold 97 enemy and puppet houses and extorted nearly 20 million yuan in Central Bank Certificates (equivalent to nearly 260 million legal tender) from merchants under false pretenses. The Wuhan United Receiving Committee Office received over 210 non-military units, but 110 units had no original inventory. Piao Luxiang, a small fire squad leader in Wuhan, also embezzled and sold enemy and puppet materials worth over 20 million yuan. Other corruption cases discovered in the area include Tang Yuchi, the director of the Hankou warehouse of the Hubei Provincial Grain Department, who embezzled 50 million yuan of public funds for usury, and the warehouse accountant who absconded with over 15 million yuan. Chen Cheng, the magistrate of Sanmen County, Zhejiang, embezzled 500 to 600 million yuan. After the above-mentioned cases were exposed, totaling over 100 trillion yuan, the authorities did not impose the deserved punishment. For example, after the case of Wang Xijun, the director of the Tianjin Public Works Bureau, was exposed, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e lectured the Public Works Bureau staff, threatening the informants as "not born of parents" and saying that they would be "thoroughly and severely punished." On September 1st, the Tianjin News reported that Chen Cheng had been accused by the people of Sanmen County and that the provincial government's investigation confirmed the allegations, but as a result, he was promoted to the magistrate of the wealthier Yueqing County.

　　国民党官官相护贪污案层出不穷
    【新华社延安十二日电】京沪平津报纸成篇累版的揭载国民党官吏贪污的消息，从数千万乃至数万万元，大多系由当地人民揭发，但一到官府，往往如“石沉大海”，没有下落。天津公用局长王锡钧与职员罗承德等五人，隐匿接收物资之原始清册，盗卖大量物资，约值数十万万元。北平公用局接收组长张雨萍侵吞碎铁一百五十余吨，洋灰六百余袋，现金二百余万元。北平南郊警察分局长吴铛借查封汉奸财产，受贿达一千四百万元。国民党山东首府顾问周某接收日寇宫岭洋行等三单位，总值数十亿元，仅报五千万元。营口市长方引之等盗卖敌伪房屋九十七幢，及借名强迫商人献金共得通券近二千万元（合法币近二亿六千万）。武汉统一接收委会办事处接收二百一十余非军事单位，竟有一百一十单位无原始清册。汉市一小小消防分队长票禄祥，侵占并变售敌伪物资亦达二千万元以上。该地其他贪污案之被发现者，尚有鄂省田粮处，汉口仓库主任汤玉池，拉用公款五千万放高利贷，该库会计拐款一千五百余万潜逃。浙江三门县长陈诚旨克五六亿元。上述被揭发案件，贪污总额超过一百万万元，这些贪污案被揭发后，当局并未加以应得的惩办，如天津公用局长王锡钧案揭发之后，天津市长张廷谔向公用局职员训话，威吓告发人为“非父母所生”，说“要彻底严办”。九月一日，天津新闻报又载陈诚旨被三门县人民告发，并经省府调查属实，但结果又升任较富庶之乐县县长。
