Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th: Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* international observer Zhukov commented on U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech, saying: "Wallace's speech as a whole is ambiguous." He pointed out that a large portion of the American press is clamoring for war propaganda among the people, hoping to "intimidate the Soviet Union" through this. American monopoly trust giants are "arming America" as their policy, which Wallace calls "criminal stupidity," a comment with which people can only fully agree. Zhukov continued: "Although Wallace's tendency is clearly to shield and avoid criticizing the policies pursued by the U.S. government today, he has to admit that on many issues, the United States has deviated from Roosevelt's foreign policy. He repeats the anti-Soviet ideas prevalent in the American official press, but at the same time, he has to admit that there are dangerous imperialist tendencies in the United States and Britain, and says that if Americans manage to overcome the imperialist tendencies of the Western world, there will be no war." Zhukov concluded: "The speech of the only remaining Roosevelt-era cabinet member in Truman's cabinet is contradictory, but it reflects the anxiety of far-sighted Americans about the consequences that endanger the cause of peace, which arise from the further strengthening of imperialist warlord tendencies in American policy."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 19th: According to Reuters, London: Some individuals in London expressed different views on certain points in U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace's speech on the 12th. Many observers in London believe that "the unrest in China, especially the war, is the most dangerous area," and not, as Wallace said, "the most dangerous area in the world is the Near East." Many observers believe that "it is a well-known fact that the Chinese government forces are fighting the CCP with American military equipment... and in China, Britain is definitely not a complicating factor." On the issue of responsibility for friction with the Soviet Union, London observers "regret Wallace's statement that Britain should be primarily responsible," and believe that "U.S. foreign policy should be clarified first." Regarding President Truman's initial statement that "Wallace's speech is consistent with the policies pursued by Secretary of State Byrnes," London observers said, "This statement is unreliable." They pointed out: "Under Byrnes's guidance, the recent U.S. note to Poland was accused by Poland of interfering in Polish internal affairs. The United States still refuses to recognize the Bulgarian government. Byrnes's very sharp tone towards Molotov at the Paris Peace Conference, and Byrnes's decision to unite with Vandenberg to conduct foreign policy guidance. All of this is difficult to reconcile with the arguments in Wallace's speech." Observers strongly stated: "There must be some straightforward talk in the Democratic Party now to resolve whether Wallace and Byrnes stand on the same foreign policy position. If not, which one is dominant."

### 真理报评论称：  华莱士演说虽前后矛盾仍反映其目光比较远大

    华莱士演说虽前后矛盾仍反映其目光比较远大
    【新华社延安十八日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家朱可夫评美商务部长华莱士的演说称：“华莱士的演说整个说来是模棱两可的。”并指出一大部分美国报纸正在人民中间喧嚣战争的说教，希望借此“恐吓苏联”，美国垄断托辣斯巨头正在“把美国武装起来”作为他们的政策，华莱士称此为“犯罪的愚蠢”，这种评语人们只有完全赞同。朱可夫继称：“虽然华莱士的倾向显然在庇护今天美政府所奉行的政策不加以批评，但是华氏却不得不承认在许多问题上，美国已脱离了罗斯福的对外政策。他重复在美官报所流行的反苏思想，但同时又不得不承认在美国与英国存在有危险的帝国主义倾向，并说如果美国人设法克服西方世界的帝国主义倾向，就不会有战争。”朱可夫结语力称：“杜鲁门内阁中唯一留下来的罗斯福时代的阁员的讲演，是前后矛盾，但却反映了美国眼光较远大的人士对那些危及和平事业的后果所感到的焦虑，这种后果是从进一步增强美国政策中帝国主义军阀倾向而产生的。”
    【新华社延安十九日电】据路透社伦敦讯：伦敦若干人士对美商务部长华莱士十二日演说中的某些论点，表示了不同的见解，伦敦许多观察家认为“在中国的不安，特别是战争，乃是潜在的最危险的区域”，而并非如华氏所说：“世界上最危险的地区是近东”。许多观察家认为“在中国政府军以美国的军事装备品对中共作战，已是世界皆知的事实……而且在中国，英国决不是一个复杂因素”。在对苏磨擦的责任问题上，伦敦观察家“遗憾在于华莱士所说的应首先由英国负责的话”，认为“首先应讲明美国的外交政策”。对于杜鲁门总统第一次谈话中所称“华氏演与国务卿贝纳斯所奉行的政策相一致”一说，伦敦观察家称：“这话是靠不住的”。并指出：“在贝纳斯指导下，美国最近向波兰的照会，波兰指责为干涉波兰内政。美国迄今仍拒绝承认保加利亚政府。贝纳斯在巴黎和会对莫洛托夫之非常尖锐的口吻，以及贝纳斯决定联合范登堡共同进行外交政策的指导。所有这一切，与华氏演说中的论点实难有符合一致之处。”观察家力称：“现在民主党中必须有一些直截了当的谈话，以解决究竟华莱士和贝纳斯是否站在同一外交政策立场的问题，如果不是，则那一个占优势。”
