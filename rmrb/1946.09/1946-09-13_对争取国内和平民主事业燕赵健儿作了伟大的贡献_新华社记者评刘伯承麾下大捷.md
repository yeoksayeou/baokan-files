Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the victory of the Eighth Route Army under the command of General Liu Bocheng on the Ji-Lu-Yu front in annihilating four divisions (now all renamed brigades) of the Kuomintang army in the Kaocheng and Dongming areas, stating: The great victory of General Liu Bocheng's Yan Zhao soldiers, echoing the seven victories in seven battles of General Su Yu's victorious troops on the Su-Wan southern front, has made a significant contribution to the great cause of "crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and striving for domestic peace and democracy." It is the supreme glory of the military and civilians in the liberated areas and will surely be hailed by the people of all liberated areas and patriotic people throughout the country.

The reporter then analyzed the significance of this victorious battle, stating: Ji-Lu-Yu is currently the main battlefield. Chiang's army's disastrous defeat this time will have a significant impact on the development of the future war situation. After Chiang Kai-shek suffered a tragic defeat in the Su-Wan battlefield in July and August, losing 60,000 troops, he concentrated 300,000 troops (one-sixth to one-seventh of all troops attacking the liberated areas) on the Zheng (Zhou)-Xu (Zhou) section of the Longhai Railway and launched a large-scale offensive against Ji-Lu-Yu from the east and west, attempting to seize central cities such as Jining and Heze, encompass the entire southwestern Shandong area, and coordinate with Chiang's army advancing towards southern Shandong, planning to open up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway within three weeks. In its initial deployment, in view of the close unity and powerful strength of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, it adopted a step-by-step approach, being very cautious and careful, and worried about being surrounded and annihilated by the Eighth Route Army along the way. However, after gaining a few places, it became dizzy with success and ventured inward. The genius commander, General Liu Bocheng, after the great victory on the Longhai Railway, on the one hand, commanded a certain unit to penetrate deep into the rear of the Chiang army in southern Henan and western Anhui, liberate Taikang and Huaiyang, and threaten the rear of the Chiang army advancing north; at the same time, he led his troops to transfer to the Kao and Dong areas, setting up a powerful encirclement, waiting for the greedy invaders to enter the circle and then annihilate them. From the 5th to the 7th of this month, in just three days, he annihilated four of their divisions, knocking out one of the two pincers of Chiang's army attacking the Ji-Lu-Yu Plain. The reporter also stated: This major blow must be very painful for Chiang Kai-shek. The annihilated Chiang army's Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army) was Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of elite troops, which had been engaged in suppressing the communists for many years. The captured division commander (former army commander) Zhao Xitian was also a veteran of the civil war, who was recently transferred from the front line in northern Hubei and suffered the complete annihilation of his army. This is the inevitable fate of carrying out an anti-people civil war. Unfortunately, the 41st Division (formerly the Army) and the 47th Division (formerly the Army) of the Sichuan Army were consumed by Chiang Kai-shek on the civil war battlefield, which was exactly his sinister plan to eliminate dissidents, which is very regrettable. The Xinhua News Agency reporter finally stated: Chiang Kai-shek's gambling enthusiasm is high, and he will not give up until he loses most of his capital. Therefore, even if the offensive on the western route fails, the eastern side is still cooperating with the Chiang army in southern Shandong to launch a fierce attack on the western area of ​​Weishan Lake. We hope that the military and civilians in the liberated areas on the front line will not be arrogant because of victory, but will continue to work hard to attack the invading army until Chiang Kai-shek's troops retreat completely.

　　对争取国内和平民主事业燕赵健儿作了伟大的贡献
    新华社记者评刘伯承麾下大捷
    【新华社延安十日电】新华社记者就冀鲁豫前线刘伯承将军指挥下之八路军，在考城、东明地区歼灭国民党军四个师（现均改称为旅）一事，发表评论称：刘伯承将军所部燕赵健儿之伟大胜利，与苏皖南线粟裕将军麾下常胜军之七战七捷交互辉映，对于“粉碎蒋介石进攻，争取国内和平民主”这个大事业，作了重大贡献，同为解放区军民的无上光荣，必将得到全解放区人民及全国爱国人士同声欢呼。
    记者继分析此一胜利战役之意义称：冀鲁豫是目前主要战场，蒋军此次惨败，对于今后战局发展将有重大影响。蒋介石七、八月间在苏皖战场损失六万之众，遭受悲惨失败后，即在陇海路郑（州）徐（州）段集中三十万大军（即进攻解放区全部兵力的六分之一到七分之一），由东西两个方面大举向冀鲁豫进攻，企图夺取济宁、荷泽等中心城市，囊括鲁西南整个地区，并与向鲁南出犯之蒋军呼应，计划于三周内打通津浦路。在其初出动时，因鉴于解放区军民紧密团结，力量强大，采取步步推进办法，十分谨慎小心，一路上担心不要被八路军包围歼灭。但当略得数地后，即冲昏头脑，冒险内进。而天才指挥者刘伯承将军，于陇海路之大胜后，一面指挥某部深入陇海路南蒋军豫南、皖西后方，解放太康、淮阳，威胁北犯蒋军之背；同时即引师转移至考、东地区，布置强大有力的包围圈，待贪婪之进犯者进入圈内，即予歼灭。自本月五日至七日三天功夫，就歼灭其四师之众，把蒋军进攻冀鲁豫平原的东西两个钳子，一下子打掉了一个。记者又称：此一重大打击，对于蒋介石一定是很痛心。被歼蒋军第三师（原第十军）为蒋介石嫡系精锐，剿共多年，被生俘之师长（原军长）赵锡田，也是内战老手，最近忽从鄂北前线调来，而遭全军覆没，这正是进行反人民内战的必然归宿。不幸川军四十一师（原军）及四十七师（原军），竟被蒋介石在内战战场上消耗，正中了他消灭异己的奸计，这是甚为惋惜的。新华社记者最后称：蒋介石的赌兴正大，他不把大部赌本输光是不肯罢休的，所以纵然西路的进犯失败，东面还正与鲁南蒋军配合向微山湖西地区猛扑，望我前线的解放区军民，千万不要闻胜而骄，要再接再厉的予进犯军以打击，直到蒋介石的部队全线败退为止。
