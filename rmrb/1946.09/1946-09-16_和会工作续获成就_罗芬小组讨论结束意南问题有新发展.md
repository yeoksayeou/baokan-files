Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: (Comprehensive Report) The work of the Paris Peace Conference continues to make progress. Yesterday (the fortieth day of the conference), the Finnish and Romanian Political and Territorial Committees concluded their discussions on the draft peace treaties and are preparing to draft their final report to the General Assembly. In the resolution of the Rovfen Political and Territorial Committee, according to a Reuters reporter, "All eight amendments proposed by Australia were rejected, and Australia only made a few changes to the wording in the preamble to the Rovfen Treaty." The Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, Mr. Dubach, officially notified all committees yesterday that their work of reviewing the draft must be completed before October 5th. From an overall perspective, a Reuters reporter pointed out that "the truly important issues still remain to be resolved" at the Peace Conference, primarily the Italian-Southern border and the Trieste issue, which is now entering a stage of concrete resolution. On the 10th, the Italian Political and Territorial Committee decided to appoint a subcommittee composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Poland, Australia, and the Netherlands to study the Trieste issue and instructed it to submit a report to the committee as soon as possible, which is a new development. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 11th, the signs of Yugoslavia's attempt to negotiate directly with Italy to resolve the Trieste issue and the Italian-Southern border issue are increasing. According to unreliable sources, Yugoslavia has reached out to discover whether Italy would agree to establish some form of joint regime in Trieste in order to effectively exempt the area from the control of the United Nations. Regarding this point, according to a United Press dispatch, Italian representative Bonomi announced on the 11th at the Italian Political and Territorial Committee that "the Italian and Yugoslav governments have reached an agreement on two basic issues: (1) the border between the two countries should follow the ethnic line; (2) the will of the people in the disputed areas should be considered when delineating this boundary." The agency also reported that Bonomi proposed that the entire Julian region vote to decide the Italian-Southern border. As of that day, the Trieste issue had been debated in the Italian Political Committee for eleven days, mainly concerning the recommendations of the Council of Foreign Ministers and the amendments of Yugoslavia, Byelorussia, and South Africa. According to a United Press report, the four-power foreign ministers' assistants, who are specifically responsible for handling treaty amendments, met again on the evening of the 11th. An official spokesman declined to explain which amendments the foreign ministers' assistants had reached an agreement on, but the spokesman said they had made satisfactory progress.

　　和会工作续获成就
    罗芬小组讨论结束意南问题有新发展
    【新华社延安十三日电】综合报导：巴黎和会的工作续有进展，昨日（会议的第四十日）芬兰与罗马尼亚政治领土委员会已结束其关于和约草案的讨论，准备向大会草拟最后报告。在罗芬政治领土委员会的决议中，据路透社记者称：“澳国所提的八个修正案全被否决，澳国只在罗芬和约序言中更动几个字句而已。”和会秘书长杜巴克于昨日正式通告各委员会称：它们审议草案的工作必须在十月五日以前完毕。从全盘来看，路透社记者指出和会中“真正重要的问题仍待解决”，这首先是意南边界与的里亚斯特问题，这一问题目前正进入具体解决的阶段。十日，意政治领土委员会曾决定指派苏、美、英、法、南、波、澳、荷八国代表组织小组委员会，研讨的里亚斯特问题，并令其尽早向委员会提出报告，这是一个新的发展。与此同时，据路透社巴黎十一日电称：南斯拉夫企图与意大利直接谈判，以解决的里亚斯特问题及意南边界问题的象征日益增加。据不可靠消息：南斯拉夫已伸出触角去发现意大利是否同意在的里亚斯特成立某种形式的联合政权，以便有效地使该地区免于受联合国权力的支配。关于此点，另据合众社电称：意代表波诺米于十一日在意政治领土委员会上宣布：“意南两国政府，已在两个基本问题上获得协议：（一）两国边界应遵循人种线；（二）在划定此种界线时并考虑争执区域中人民的意志”。该社同时报导：波诺米又提议由朱理亚区全投票以决定意南边界。截至是日止，的里亚斯特问题在意政委会中已辩论了十一天，主要系外长会议的建议案与南斯拉夫白俄罗斯及南非之修正案。据合众社报导：专门负责处理和约修正案之四强外长助理，于十一日晚再度会晤，官方发言人拒绝说明外长助理在那些修正案上已获协议，但发言人称他们已有满意的进展。
