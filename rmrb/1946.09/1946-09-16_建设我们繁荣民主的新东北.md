　　Building Our Prosperous and Democratic New Northeast
　　Heilongjiang's Industry and Commerce Flourishing

　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 12th. With the assistance of the democratic government, industry and commerce in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are developing day by day. In Baiquan County, the number of stores has increased from over 300 during the puppet Manchukuo period to 563. Small and medium-sized businesses and handicrafts are the most prosperous. There are more than ten machine cotton ginning factories, and the development of labor-capital joint ventures or public-private joint ventures is even more prominent. In addition to Chen's oil mill, there are many rice mills collectively run by farmers. Cart transportation is constant on the highway from Baiquan to Keshan and Hailun. Kedong County plans to repair the 27-li-long railway from ×× to the county seat to facilitate business travel, which is expected to be completed by the end of September.

　　Liberated Peasants Change Village Names

　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 12th. After the peasants in various places gained liberation and were distributed land seized from the enemy and puppets, they actively engaged in production and changed their old village names to new and auspicious names to symbolize their rebirth. The peasants in Changban, Chejia Wobeng, and Taipingshanban villages in Jiu Jing District of Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, have changed their original village names to new village names such as "Democracy Ban," "Liberation Ban," and "Unity Ban." Xiaodianban in Henan District of Keshan County was also changed to "United Ban" by local people's resolution. Wangdaban in Yian was also renamed "Prosperous Ban." New village names such as "Glory Ban" and "Victory Ban" have appeared in Haelun Sanshengguan District one after another. When the Dongyang District of Gannan County, Nenjiang Province, changed the old eleven bans into six administrative villages, everyone said: "In the past, most of the names of the bans were named after the individual large grain households in the area. All the rich and powerful families regarded the bans as their own. Today, we talk about democracy, and the common people have been liberated. The newly divided administrative villages must also have new names." They immediately decided to add new names such as "Peace" and "Democracy" to these liberated new villages.

　　建设我们繁荣民主的新东北
    黑龙江各地工商业繁荣
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十二日电】黑龙江省各地工商业在民主政府协助之下，日益发展，拜泉县由伪满时三百多家商店，增至五百六十三家，其中以中小商业及手工业最为繁荣，如机器弹花工厂就有十余家，劳资合营或公私合营企业的发展更为突出。陈工人经营的油坊外，尚有农民集体经营之制米厂甚多。拜泉至克山与海伦的公路上，大车运输来往不绝。克东县计划修复××至县城二十七里长之铁道，以利商旅，预计九月末即可修成。
    翻身农民更换村名
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十二日电】各地农民获得翻身和分得敌伪土地后，积极从事生产，并纷纷改换旧有村名，以新鲜而吉祥的名字来象征他们的新生。黑龙江省拜泉县久敬区长阪、车家窝棚、太平山阪等村农民都把他们原来的村名改成“民主阪”、“翻身阪。”“团结阪”等新村名，克山县河南区原来之小店阪，亦经当地人民公决，改为“联合阪”。依安之王大半阪亦改称“兴旺阪”。海伦三圣官区先后出现“光荣阪”、“胜利阪”等新村名。嫩江省甘南县东阳区将旧有十一个阪改为六个行政村时，大家都说：“过去阪的名字大多数是以当地个别大粮户的姓名而起的，一切有钱有势的人家把阪子当他们自己的，今天讲民主，老百姓翻了身，新划的行政村也要起个新名字。”他们当即决定以“和平”、“民主”等新名字加与这些翻过身来的新村庄。
