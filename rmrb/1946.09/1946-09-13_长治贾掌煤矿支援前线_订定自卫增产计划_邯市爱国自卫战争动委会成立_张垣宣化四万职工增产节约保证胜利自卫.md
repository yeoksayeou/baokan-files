Changzhi, 11th—To increase production for self-defense and support the front lines, the Jia Zhang Village Coal Mine in Changzhi County launched an increased production campaign in September. To this end, the mine's trade union organized the study of the new policy of labor-capital cooperation to align the thinking of some staff and workers. Originally, the mine was publicly owned, but later, by recruiting commercial shares, it was transformed into a joint public-private venture. Currently, commercial shares exceed government investment, leading some older workers to believe that in the past, production was for the country and the revolution, but today it has become for capitalists. Therefore, their labor enthusiasm is not high. Some staff also believe that eight years of arduous resistance war was to serve the country, the nation, and the masses. Why are they now serving capitalists? Hence, they resist the idea. Through study and discussion since mid-August, the above-mentioned thinking has been largely resolved. All employees now recognize that today, workers and capitalists are working together to develop China's national industry, and their interests can be unified. Workers' lives must be appropriately improved, but at the same time, capitalists' profits must be taken into account to allow their businesses to develop. The increase in both profits and wages must be based on increased production. During the study, combined with the current situation, employees realized that due to the invasion of American goods, China's national industry has been greatly damaged, and the Kuomintang areas are increasingly being colonized. The labor-capital cooperation policy for developing national capital is a new patriotic action. At the same time, it is currently extremely necessary to make the industrial production in the liberated areas self-sufficient to enhance self-defense capabilities. The slogan of "increased production for self-defense" has now been enthusiastically responded to by all employees. Workers have successively formulated self-defense and increased production plans, and a hot and bustling September large-scale production is about to fully unfold.

Handan News—To strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, the Handan City All-Circles Patriotic Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee held its founding meeting on the 29th of last month at the City Federation of Industry and Commerce. Those present included Director Chao of the Border Region Education Department, Mayor Wang, Director Yan of the City Garrison Command, and representatives from all circles. In addition to discussing the organizational structure, a detailed discussion was held on the current central tasks, deciding to widely carry out propaganda and education work in the future, so that everyone deeply understands the nature and prospects of the patriotic self-defense war and its relationship with every citizen, creating a wave of support for the army, donations, and慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) front-line soldiers, and using all forces to support the front lines and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.

Also—All teachers and students of Handan Middle School, in order to慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) the soldiers and wounded comrades who are defending the border area on the front lines, have decided to eat less wheat and more millet, and donate the savings to the front. Student Zhao Qingquan of Class Three donated his shoes to the soldiers on the front lines, responding to Chairman Yang's call. Guo Yishan, a poor student in Class Two, donated his accumulated 200 yuan. Dr. Chen Yuzhou of the school donated five large bottles of Rendan (a type of Chinese medicine) to the soldiers on the front lines. The Qinyeyuan (diligent service personnel) comrades each donated 100 yuan to慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) the front lines. Now, they are collecting慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) items and writing慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) letters. (Meng Xiuling)

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th—Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and other cities, more than 40,000 employees are actively increasing production and conserving resources to support the front lines and organizing armed preparations for self-defense. Workers in various factories affiliated with the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua have automatically resolved that before smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, everyone will work one extra hour each day and save 1 million yuan and more than 8,000 jin of grain to慰问 (wèiwèn, express sympathy and solicitude to) the front lines. The North China Machine Manufacturing Factory in Zhangjiakou City, the Zhangjiakou Tobacco Company, the Minsheng Electric Power Company, and others have been swept into a hot wave of production competition to aid the front lines. The Clothing Factory of the Logistics Department of the Military Region has completed all winter clothing in a short period. All workers automatically worked up to ten hours, canceled Sunday holidays, and responsible personnel such as factory directors personally went on the machines to participate in production. Workers at a certain repair shop worked temporarily for 14 hours to complete a batch of weapons repairs. Every night, they held meetings to review production records. Many old workers only closed their eyes for a moment at night and immediately got up to lead the start of production. Workers at the Zhangbei United Factory completed a batch of military supplies production tasks in a rush with ten hours of intensive work every day. Model workers who exceeded half-time efficiency by one to several times continued to emerge. Usually, each female worker averaged two sets of military uniforms, but now it has generally increased to four sets. Leather and fur workers have also increased from making one fur coat a day to two and a half.

　　长治贾掌煤矿支援前线
    订定自卫增产计划
    邯市爱国自卫战争动委会成立
    张垣宣化四万职工增产节约保证胜利自卫
    【本报长治十一日电】为增产自卫支援前线，长治县属之贾掌村煤矿于九月份掀起增产运动。该矿职工会为此，曾组织学习劳资合作新方针，以打通部分职员与工人思想。按该矿原为公营，后经招募商股转为公私合营。现商股已多于政府投资，致部分老工人认为过去生产是为国家为革命，而今天则变成为资本家，因此劳动热情不高，部分职员亦认为八年艰苦抗战，为国家、为民族、为群众服务，为什么今天又为资本家服务？因而思想抵抗。经八月中旬以来的学习讨论，上述思想大体已获解决。全体职工均已认识今天工人与资本家，同为发展我国民族工业而努力，双方的利益是可以统一的。工人生活必须适当改善，但同时又须照顾资本家利润，使其事业获得发展。而利润与工资的增加，均必须建立在增产的基础上。在学习中，并结合当前时局，使职工认识由于美货侵袭，我国民族工业大受破坏，国民党区已日益殖民地化。发展民族资本的劳资合作方针，正是新的爱国行动。同时当前极需使解放区工业生产自给自足，以增强自卫力量。增产自卫的口号，现已获得全体职工热烈响应。工人纷纷订出自卫增产的计划，热火朝天的九月大生产即将全面展开。
    【本报邯郸讯】为争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，本市各界爱国自卫战争动员委员会于上月二十九日在市商联会召开成立大会。到会者有边区教育厅晁厅长、王市长、市警备司令部阎主任及各界代表。除讨论组织机构外，对目前中心工作曾作了详尽的讨论，决定今后广泛开展宣传教育工作，使每个人深刻明了爱国自卫战争的性质前途以及和每个市民的关系，造成拥军献金慰劳前线将士的热潮，以一切力量支援前线，粉碎蒋介石的进攻。
    【又讯】邯郸中学全体师生，为了慰劳前线保卫边区的战士及伤员同志们，已决定少吃麦子，多吃小米，节约出来的东西献给前方。三班赵清泉同学将自己的鞋献给前方将士，响应杨主席的号召。二班贫苦同学郭溢山捐献自己积蓄二百元。校医陈玉周先生将五大瓶仁丹献给前方将士，勤业员同志每人都献金一百元慰劳前线。现在一面募集慰劳品，一面写慰劳信。（孟秀岭）
    【新华社张家口十日电】张垣、宣化等城市，四万余职工积极增产节约支援前线，并组织武装准备自卫。宣化龙烟铁矿所属各厂工人，已自动议决在粉碎蒋介石进攻以前，全体每日再加工一小时，并节约献金一百万元，粮食八千余斤慰劳前线。张市华北机器制造厂，张垣烟草公司，民生电业公司等已卷入援助前线生产竞赛的热潮，军区后勤部被服厂已于短期内完成全部冬季服装，全体工人自动加工至十小时，取消星期休假日，厂长等负责人员也亲自登上机子参加生产，某修械所工人为紧张完成一批武器的修制，临时加工至十四小时，每晚均开会检讨生产纪录，许多老工人夜晚睡觉只合一合眼即起来领导开工生产。张北联合工厂工人，每日十小时的紧张工作，突击完成一批军需生产任务。超过半时效率一倍至数倍的模范工人，不断涌现，平时每个女工平均缝制军装两套，现普遍提高至四套，皮毛工人每日亦由作一件皮大衣提高到两件半。
