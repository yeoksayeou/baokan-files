　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau
    Cables Congratulations to Soldiers on the Southern Tongpu Line
    [This newspaper, Handan, 1st dispatch] The CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau recently sent a telegram to all corps, guerrilla teams, and militia self-defense members on the southern Tongpu line, congratulating them on the victory of this self-defense operation. The original telegram stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries launched a full-scale civil war and launched a large-scale northward offensive along the Tongpu Line. You rose up to defend yourselves. The Battle of Wenxi gave the Chiang army a great blow. Now you have successively captured three cities, with remarkable achievements. I hereby celebrate your victory and encourage you to continue your efforts, continue to work hard, and inflict new blows on the reactionaries' offensive, to crush their civil war plan to occupy the southern section of Tongpu, and strive for the victory of the cause of independence, peace, and democracy.
