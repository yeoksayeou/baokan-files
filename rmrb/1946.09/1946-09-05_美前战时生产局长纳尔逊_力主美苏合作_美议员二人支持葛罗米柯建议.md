Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Washington dispatch: Former US War Production Board Chief, Nelson, in his recent book, strongly advocates US-Soviet cooperation. He wrote: "I see no more reason for us to fight the Soviet Union than to fight a planet. There is no fundamental conflict of interest between the United States and the Soviet Union, and therefore we have no fundamental dispute worth sacrificing a single life." He said that his conversations with Stalin during the war convinced him that there was no sentiment in the Soviet Union in favor of fighting the United States, although many frictions had occurred in recent months.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: New York dispatch: Mrs. Roosevelt, on July 24, commented in the newspapers on Soong Ching Ling's statement, saying: "The United States will never violate its own wishes and be forced to fight the Soviet Union. China continues to engage in civil war under the guise of peace. For the sake of world peace, China should cooperate and unite."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Washington dispatch: Two Democratic senators support the proposal made by the Soviet representative Gromyko to the United Nations Security Council, which requires all member states of the United Nations to publicly report and station troops in countries other than the former Axis powers and their vassal states. The two Democratic senators are Francis Myers of Pennsylvania and Warren G. Magnuson of Washington. Note: Among the member states of the United Nations, those currently stationing troops in countries other than the former Axis powers (Germany, Japan, and Italy) and their vassal states (Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, and Austria) include the United States in China, Iceland, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific and Atlantic belonging to Britain, Austria, France, Portugal, etc.; Britain in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Indonesia, India, etc.; France in Vietnam; the Netherlands in Indonesia, etc.

　　美前战时生产局长纳尔逊
    力主美苏合作
    美议员二人支持葛罗米柯建议
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：前美战时生产局局长纳尔逊在其近著中，力主美苏合作。他写道：“我看不出我们应和苏联作战比我们应和行星作战有更多的理由，美国和苏联并没有基本上的利益冲突，我们因此也没有值得牺牲一条生命的基本纠纷。”他说他在战时和斯大林的谈话，使他相信在苏联并无赞成与美国作战的情绪，虽然在最近的几个月来发生了许多磨擦。
    【新华社延安二日电】纽约讯：罗斯福总统夫人七月二十四日在报端著文评论宋庆龄之文告称：“美国决不致违背本愿而被迫与苏联作战。中国在和平之表面下竟继续从事内战，为世界之和平计，中国实应合作统一。”
    【新华社延安二日电】华盛顿讯：美两位民主党参议员支持苏联代表葛罗米柯向联合国安全理事会所提的建议，即要求联合国各会员国公开报告及驻扎于前轴心国及其附庸国以外的其他国家中的军队。此二位民主党参议员为宾夕法尼亚州的法兰西斯·梅耶斯和华盛顿州的华伦·李格纽逊。按：目前联合国会员国中驻军于前轴心国（德日意）及其附庸国（罗保匈芬奥）以外的其他国家者，计有美国在中国、冰岛、菲律滨以及太平洋与大西洋的其他英、奥、法、葡等国所属的岛屿，英国在希腊、埃及、伊拉克、印尼、印度等地，法国在越南，荷兰在印尼等等。
