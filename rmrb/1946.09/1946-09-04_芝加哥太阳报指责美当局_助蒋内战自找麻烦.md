Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. According to U.S. News Service on the 26th: The Chicago Sun Times editorial commented on the situation in China, stating: "We are treading on thin ice in China. We are finding trouble for ourselves in China. We cannot support Truman's statement last December, and thus are asking for trouble. President Truman said that the United States should aid the Chiang Kai-shek regime under certain conditions, namely, to cease the conflict and organize a coalition government. However, while General Marshall was fulfilling this promise, we unconditionally transferred military aid and millions of dollars to the Kuomintang. Indeed, when the reactionaries in the Kuomintang know that we are supporting them, why should they concede? When they are certain that the United States will support them against the Soviet Union, how can they maintain peace? Our foreign policy is too heavily influenced by the idea of using China as a military base. This idea not only betrays the Chinese people but also hinders us from achieving our goals." The editorial continued: "China is ruled by those undemocratic reactionaries who are creating war. The people of China hate the United States. If we want to gain friendship, we should start what we have not done and stop what we have done. We should support progressive leaders striving for peace, not those reactionary elements creating war. We should encourage land reform and resource development, not war; we should assist local democratic governments, not dictators; we should help build a prosperous and young country, and never lead China into poverty and civil war. Simply put, we should follow the original intention when we sent General Marshall, and urge the Communists and liberal Kuomintang members to organize a coalition government that satisfies the wishes of the majority of the people." The editorial concluded: "We should treat China with a friendly attitude, instead of treating her as a military base." Note: The Chicago Sun Times is one of the progressive newspapers in the United States. Its publisher is Field, and it is a sister newspaper of the New York Morning Post.

　　芝加哥太阳报指责美当局
    助蒋内战自找麻烦
    【新华社延安三十日电】据美新闻处二十六日讯：芝加哥太阳报社论评中国之局势称：我们在中国如履薄冰，我们自己在中国找出麻烦来，我们不能支持去年十二月间杜鲁门的声明，因而自找烦恼。杜鲁门总统曾说美国当在某种条件上援助蒋介石政权，这种条件，就是停止冲突组织联合政府。然而在马歇尔将军履行此项诺言声中，我们却毫无条件地转送军事援助和万万千金元给国民党。真的，当国民党中的反动分子晓得我们正支持他们时，他们为什么要让步呢？当他们确定美国将支持他们对付苏联时，他们又怎肯维护和平呢？我们的外交政策以中国作为军事基地的观念着实太浓厚了，这种观念非但出卖中国人民，且妨害我们达成目标。该社论继称：中国由那些不民主的且在制造战争的反动派统治的，中国的人民痛恨美国，假如我们为获得友谊着想，我们就应展开我们所未做的工作并停止已做的工作，我们应支持争取和平的前进领袖，不支持那些制造战争的反动分子。我们应鼓励土地改革和资源发展，不应鼓励战争；应援助地方民主政府，不援助独裁者；应协助建立一繁荣而且年青的国家，切勿引导中国走入贫苦和内战之境。简单的说来，我们应一本派遣马歇尔将军时之初衷做去，并促使中共和自由国民党人组织一满足大多数人民愿望的联合政府。该社论最后称：我们应该以友好的态度对待中国，而不应该把她当作军事根据地。按：芝加哥太阳报为美国进步报纸之一，其发行人为菲尔德，为纽约上午报的姊妹报。
