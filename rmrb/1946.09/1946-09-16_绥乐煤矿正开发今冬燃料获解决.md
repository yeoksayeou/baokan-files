　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, September 13th: Heilongjiang Province is developing the Suile Coal Mine, and the trials have been successful. The winter fuel problem is expected to be solved. To plan and lead the coal mining work, the province formed a Coal Mine Preparatory Office in mid-June. At the end of July, the first batch of 42 exploration and mining team members, led by Mining Engineer Rong Lianting from Caike County, set off. They trekked 260 *li* along a desolate and muddy road where no one had travelled before, reaching the end of the Maziliang mining area – a deserted mountain forest – and began their arduous work. They felled trees to build houses and started digging pits, and on August 20th, they discovered the coal mine. The workers, with joyful hearts, dug out the first seam of coal and worked even harder and more carefully. Engineer Rong said: Digging another two *zhang* will reveal a large coal seam, and it may surpass the Heligang Coal Mine in Hejiang Province. The second batch of workers has now gone up the mountain. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the workers are working happily, hoping that their victorious fruits will burn in every household's stove this winter.

　　绥乐煤矿正开发今冬燃料获解决
    【新华社齐齐哈尔十三日电】黑龙江省开采绥乐煤矿，已试验成功，今冬燃料问题可望解决。为计划领导采煤工作，该省曾于六月中旬组成煤矿筹备处，七月底即编成第一批探采队四十二人，由采坷县手荣琏廷矿师率领。沿荒芜泥泞之无人道上跋涉二百六十里到达马子良矿区尽头——人烟绝迹的山林中，开始了艰苦的工作，砍伐树木盖起房屋并动手掘坑，八月二十日即发现煤矿。工人们以欢喜的心情，掘出第一线煤后，更加努力小心的工作。荣矿师称：再掘两丈即可见到大煤质，且可超过合江省之鹤立岗煤矿。现第二批工人已上山，工人们在民主政府领导下愉快的工作，期望他们胜利的果实，今冬能在每家炉中燃烧起来。
