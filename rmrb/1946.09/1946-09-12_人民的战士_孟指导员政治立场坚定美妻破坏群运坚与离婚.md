　　The People's Warrior

    Instructor Meng's Firm Political Stance – Beautiful Wife Destroys Mass Movement, He Firmly Divorces Her

    [This Dispatch from Wu'an] Comrade Meng Xiangmi, instructor of a company in the 48th Regiment of the 16th Brigade, resolutely stood on the side of the masses and divorced his wife who was undermining the mass emancipation movement, winning the admiration of the masses. Comrade Meng has been in the Eighth Route Army for seven years, is very brave in combat, and has a high level of class consciousness. He married a woman from Wu'an before the great counter-offensive last year and then immediately went to the front. His wife was young and beautiful, and settled down in Yehe Village, Wu'an. The masses cared for her in every possible way. Who knew that after she arrived in the village, she colluded with bad elements everywhere to strike at good people. She even instigated militiamen to shoot village cadres in the dark, attempting to sabotage the mass emancipation movement. Her lifestyle was also very improper, and she corrupted several women's association members. When Comrade Meng returned home some time ago, she again provoked him, saying that the village cadres wanted to rape her. Comrade Meng immediately conducted an investigation in the village and finally understood all her bad deeds of sabotaging work. He then joined the village cadres in trying to persuade her. However, she remained obstinate and refused to admit her mistakes. Comrade Meng decided to divorce her, and at a mass meeting in the village, he recounted her mistakes and stated that he would resolutely stand on the side of the masses and abandon the bad wife. He received enthusiastic support from the masses and has now formally completed the divorce procedures at the district office.
