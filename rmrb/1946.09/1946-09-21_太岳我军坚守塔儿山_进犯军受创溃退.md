　　Taiyue Our Army Firmly Defends Ta'er Mountain
    Invading Army Suffers Losses and Collapses
    [This newspaper Yangcheng 18th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan jointly launched a fierce attack on our Ta'er Mountain positions at the border of Lin (Fen) and Qu (Wo) on the 13th from Linfen. Our army was in high spirits and firmly defended the position, inflicting heavy blows on the invading army. The Chiang-Yan coalition forces could not withstand the attack and collapsed. We also took the opportunity to recover many invaded villages and towns such as Laoguanzhuang, Shangxiaguan, Zhangxiang, Baotou, Chenghuanglianli, etc. The Chiang-Yan army has now retreated to the area of Linfen and Mengcheng and Gaoxian.
