　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: General Yang Zhengmin, the eldest son of General Yang Hucheng and Deputy Commander of the Guanzhong District Garrison of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, spoke to reporters regarding the uprising of General Kong Congzhou and others of the 17th Route Army, and the 3rd Battalion of the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment, as well as Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of eliminating the Northwest Army. He stated, "The recent uprising of Battalion Commander Ge Lancheng, leading officers and soldiers of the 3rd Battalion of the Shaanxi Security 6th Regiment, is the inevitable result of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's implementation of a civil war policy in Shaanxi." In addition to expressing his congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, General Yang also extended his respects to Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, General Kong Congzhou and other former members of the 17th Route Army who revolted on the front lines of the civil war. General Yang continued, "During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the former members of the 17th Route Army fought on various battlefields, charging and fighting bravely, making contributions. However, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan did not reward these troops who contributed to the war of resistance, but instead intensified their means of disintegration and elimination, assassinating General Xu Quanzhong, transferring Generals Sun Weiru and Zhao Shoushan, and dispatching a large number of Central Military Academy students to replace the old officers. The old 17th Route Army had more than 80,000 men, but now it has been weakened to just over 10,000." General Yang said with sorrow and indignation, "My father has been imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek for ten years, and we have not been allowed to correspond even once. It is said that in long-term dark imprisonment, my father's hair has turned white, my mother is suffering from neurosis due to worry and anger, and my eighteen-year-old brother has been deprived of his right to study. This spring, after Chiang Kai-shek announced the release of political prisoners at the Political Consultative Conference, I was delighted, thinking that I would be reunited with my father; prominent figures and gentry in Shaanxi have also repeatedly urged his release, but Chiang Kai-shek has once again revealed himself as a great liar in front of the people!" General Yang then exposed Hu Zongnan's consistent manipulation of Shaanxi's politics, culture, and his various crimes of slaughtering progressive people, and then said, "Under such extremely reactionary rule, farmers in Weinan have already beaten the Baojia chiefs to death." Finally, General Yang also lodged a serious protest against Hu Zongnan's continued pursuit and interception of the CCP's Central Plains troops, saying, "This shows that the anti-communist warmonger Hu Zongnan is determined to expand the civil war to Shaanxi, and the people of Shaanxi will never agree! The people will mobilize their own strength to smash Hu Zongnan's attack!"

　　杨拯民将军发表谈话
    祝贺十七路军起义诸将领
    愤恨蒋介石消灭异己囚禁乃父杨虎城
    【新华社延安七日电】杨虎城将军长公子，陕甘宁边区关中区警备副司令员杨拯民将车，为十七路军孔从周等将军、陕保六团三大队之起义暨蒋介石消灭西北军罪恶事，对记者发表谈话称：“最近葛兰丞大队长率领陕保六团三大队官兵举行起义，是蒋介石、胡宗南在陕西实施内战政策的必然结果。”杨将军除对记者表示向三大队起义官兵祝贺外，并对其他在内战前线起义的十七路军旧部张复振、刘威诚及孔从周等将军遥致敬意。杨将军继称：“在八年抗战中，十七路旧部转战各战场，冲锋陷阵，出生入死，建树了功勋。但蒋介石、胡宗南对此抗战有功部队不予奖赏，反更加紧其分化消灭手段，暗杀许权中将军，调离孙慰如、赵寿山两将军，大量派遣中央军校学生去接替旧有军官。十七路旧部共八万余人，现削弱到只剩下一万多人。”杨将军悲愤的说：“我的父亲被蒋介石囚禁已十个年头，我们没有被允许通一次信。据说在长期阴暗囚禁中，家父须发皆白，母亲亦因忧愤而患神经病，十八岁弟弟被剥夺了读书权利，当今年春天政协会上蒋介石宣布释放政治犯后，我欣喜的想着将和家父团聚；陕西名流士绅也曾再三催促释放，但蒋介石在人民面前又一次显露出他是一个大骗子！”杨将军接着揭发胡宗南历来操纵陕西政治、文化以及屠杀进步人士种种罪行，后称：“在如此极端反动统治下，渭南已发生农民打死保甲长的事。”最后，杨将军并就胡宗南继续追击堵截中共中原部队提出严重抗议说：“这是表明反共好战分子胡宗南决心把内战扩大到陕西，陕西人民是决不会答应的！人民将动员自己力量，粉碎胡宗南的进攻！”
