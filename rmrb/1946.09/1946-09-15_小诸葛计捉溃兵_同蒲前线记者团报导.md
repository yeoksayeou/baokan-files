　　Little Zhuge's Clever Plan to Capture Defeated Soldiers
    Frontline Report from the Tongpu Railway Reporter Group

    Squad Leader Six is nicknamed "Little Zhuge." He is a man of many schemes. This time, while searching for defeated Yan Xishan soldiers in Zhao City, he came up with another plan, effortlessly capturing over a hundred people. Everyone praised "Little Zhuge" as indeed a "Little Zhuge."

    During the Zhao City battle, "Little Zhuge" led eight men to search for scattered Yan puppet soldiers on the Fen River滩. However, the crops in the mountains on both sides grew to four feet tall, and the defeated soldiers were hiding inside. We had to bend our backs secretly, conceal ourselves, and walk a long way inside. Anyone could take a potshot at you at any time. Not to mention eight people, even eighty people would have difficulty completing this task. "Little Zhuge" walked along, constantly devising a plan.

    Walking past a field of crops, it was calm and quiet. But there were sounds coming from this field. "Little Zhuge" thought there must be people inside, possibly many people. "Little Zhuge" then pretended to be a battalion commander.

    "First company, occupy the high ground in the southwest! Second company, occupy the embankment in front! Third company..."

    After "Little Zhuge" issued the orders, he shouted loudly:

    "Hey! You can't get past! The west side of the river is all our Eighth Route Army!"

    "Surrender your weapons and be treated leniently! No killing!"

    People walked out of the crop field, one, two, carrying American guns… "Little Zhuge" welcomed them, comforted them, and organized them to shout:

    "Come out! They won't kill anyone!"

    "The Eighth Route Army does not kill prisoners!"

    Some of the prisoners could even call out the names of their comrades. So three and two… In the end, more than a hundred people came out.

　　小诸葛计捉溃兵
    同蒲前线记者团报导
    六班长外号“小诸葛”，他是一个计谋多端的人，这回在赵城搜索阎军溃兵的时候，又生出一计，毫不费力的搜索出了一百多人，大家同声称赞“小诸葛”就是一个“小诸葛”。
    赵城战斗中，“小诸葛”带了八个人，在汾河滩上搜索被打散了的阎伪军。可是两面山里庄稼长得四尺高，溃兵都躲藏在里面，我们人在里面悄悄弯弓着背，隐蔽着走很远的路，随时都有人打你一下冷枪，不说八个人，就是八十个人也难完成这个任务。“小诸葛”一路走，一路在订计策。
    走过一片庄稼地，这时风平浪静，但这片庄稼里却有响声，“小诸葛”想里面一定有人，可能还是不少的人。“小诸葛”就此装起营长来。
    “第一连占领西南上的高地，第二连占领正面地堰，第三连……。”
    小诸葛下过命令后，就大声喊着：
    “喂！你们走不过去了，河西都是我们八路军！”
    “缴枪优待，不杀！”
    庄稼地里有人走出来了，一个，两个，带着美国枪………“小诸葛”欢迎他们，安慰他们，又组织他们喊话：
    “出来吧，人家就是不杀！”
    “八路军不杀俘虏！”
    有的俘虏还能叫出他伙伴的名字，于是三个两个，……最后一百多人都出来了。
