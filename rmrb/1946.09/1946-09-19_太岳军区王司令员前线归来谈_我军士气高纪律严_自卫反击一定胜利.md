　　【Benbao Taiyue Sixteenth Electric】Our reporter met yesterday in a certain place with General Wang Xinting, commander of the Taiyue Military Region, who had just returned from the Datong-Puzhou front. General Wang first pointed out that since our army began its self-defense counterattack in Hongdong on the Datong-Puzhou Railway on August 14, it has broken the bridge between Chiang and Yan's north-south coordination, controlled 270 li of railway line, and cleared out the Yan army defenses in five county towns, 52 major townships, and the famous Fujiatan coal mining area along the line. This shattered Chiang and Yan's illusion of joining forces in Taiyuan, and we are now completely in an active position. We can move freely on the railway line, which is about 270 li long. In particular, after the Taiyue and Luliang Eighth Route Armies joined forces in Fenxi, the two major liberated areas were linked together, and we can further compress the invading Chiang army southward along both the east and west banks of the Fen River. During the self-defense counterattack, it was obvious that the Chiang and Yan armies were confused in command, neglecting one thing for another, and their morale was extremely low. Wherever our army counterattacked, the Yan puppet garrison forces surrendered in entire companies. When we captured Huoxian, the Yan army artillerymen who laid down their weapons turned their mountain guns around to attack the Yan army fortifications and fire back at the Yan army fortifications. Many prisoners said that "the Chiang-Yan civil war is the most annoying thing for lower-ranking officers." On the contrary, our army has high morale and strict discipline. Before the battle, we conducted in-depth discipline education, stipulating (1) not to enter civilian houses or shops; (2) not to request meals; (3) not to beat or scold the masses, and to treat the masses with kindness. The operational orders listed mass discipline as an important item. The various combat units competed to launch model mass discipline competitions, which further gained the sympathy and support of the broad masses. During the counterattack in Hongdong, the masses automatically prepared ladders and springboards for the troops, and simultaneously with the troops, they climbed the city walls to transport ammunition. Our army is now completely invincible. General Wang finally said: Although the Chiang army has occupied four of our counties in southern Shanxi, the victory of the war does not lie in the gain or loss of one city or place, but in the growth and decline of living forces. We annihilated 10,000 Yan troops in the Datong-Puzhou campaign, while the Chiang army did not eliminate even one of our squads. The Chiang army's expansion of power in southern Shanxi has reached its peak, and its forces are dispersed and weak everywhere, making the situation even more unfavorable. Now the Chiang army is also mobilizing and deploying, and a new offensive may begin soon, but no matter whether the Chiang army advances north or east, its defeat is doomed.

　　太岳军区王司令员前线归来谈
    我军士气高纪律严
    自卫反击一定胜利
    【本报太岳十六日电】记者昨日于某地会见甫自同蒲前线归来之太岳军区司令员王新亭将军，王将军首先指出我军自八月十四日开始在同蒲线之洪洞自卫反击以来，拆断了蒋阎南北呼应的桥梁，控制二百七十华里的铁路线，沿线五座县城五十二处主要乡镇及著名的富家滩煤矿区之阎军守备悉数为我扫清，这样便粉碎了蒋阎军在太原会师的幻想，我们现已完全处于主动地位，在长约二百七十华里的铁路线上，可以运动自如，特别是太岳、吕梁八路军在汾西会师之后，两大解放区联成一片，更可沿汾河东西两岸向南压缩北犯蒋军。我军于自卫反击中，明显的看出蒋阎军之指挥混乱顾此失彼，士气低落异常。我军反击之处，阎伪守军整连列队缴械，在我攻取霍县时，阎军放下武器之炮兵掉转用以进攻八路军之山炮回击阎军工事，许多俘虏均称“蒋阎内战是下级军官最讨厌的事情”。相反的我军士气高涨纪律严明，战斗前即深入进行纪律教育，规定（一）不入民房不入商店；（二）不派饭；（三）不打骂群众，对群众态度和霭，作战命令中把群众纪律列为重要一项。各战斗单位争相展开模范群众纪律竞赛，更是得到广大群众的同情和支持。在反击洪洞时，群众自动给部队准备梯子跳板，并与部队同时登城输送弹药，我军已完全立于不败之地。王将军最后称：蒋军虽侵占我晋南四个县城，但战争之胜利不在一城一地之得失，而在有生力量之消长，我在同蒲战役中歼灭阎军一万，而蒋军不曾消灭过我们一个班。蒋军在晋南伸张力量已到顶点，兵力分散处处薄弱，形势更为不利。现在蒋军亦正在调动部署，新的进攻可能在不久开始，但蒋军不论北进东进，其失败是注定了的。
