　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th—Just as Chiang Kai-shek was actively deploying a large-scale offensive against the people's city of Zhangjiakou, the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a huge special agent military conspiracy case. The main criminal in the case, Liu Jianxun, the deputy commander of the "Central Direct-Controlled Advancement Army Fourth Army" dispatched by the Guomindang Beiping Pacification Headquarters to Zhangjiakou to organize riots, and several others, have all been captured. Relevant official documents, seals, stamps, commissions, and correspondence related to the case have also been seized. Liu Jianxun was interrogated by the local court, and the evidence was conclusive and undeniable. He was executed by firing squad on the 23rd. According to Liu's confession: After the "July 7th Incident," he served as the captain of a Japanese special agent detachment in Tianjin, where he was favored by the Japanese for suppressing the people's anti-Japanese activities. After the Japanese surrendered, he was re-enlisted and trusted by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent agencies. When Chiang flew to Beiping last year, he personally appointed He Zhonghua (Major General Staff Officer of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, commander of the Nationalist Party's First Division during the Anti-Japanese War, who was captured and surrendered to the enemy during the Henan campaign) as the commander of the "Central Direct-Controlled Advancement Army" Fourth Army, and Liu Jianxun as the deputy commander, to sneak into Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou to organize "underground troops" to instigate disturbances. After receiving the order, Liu came to Chahar Province to carry out activities in October of last year, attempting to gather the remnants of the puppet troops Wang Jichuan, Wang Yulin, Yu Huanxi, etc., to be reorganized in Nankou, with special orders to attack. He also went to Datong to make contact, and to Zhangbei, Baoyuan and other places in Inner Mongolia to organize the scattered bandits and puppet troops Cao Kai, Xu Hailong, Xu Laoda, Wang Linfa, He Chongguang, etc., as well as political bandits Huang Jinrong, Cao Jinyu, Fang Cunfu, Yang Wanrong, Lang Zhanshan, etc., who were active in the Yuxian and Zhuolu areas, to coordinate with the riots. Recently, the Beiping Pacification Headquarters instructed Liu to respond from within and cooperate with the offensive when Chiang's troops began to attack the eastern end of the Ping-Sui Railway. After the Zhangjiakou Public Security Bureau detected this conspiracy, it quickly cracked the case.

　　刘逆经审讯证据确凿已枪决
    【新华社张家口二十五日电】正当蒋介石积极部署向人民城市张家口大举进攻之际，张市公安局于日前破获巨大特务军事阴谋案一起。该案主犯国民党北平行营派遣来张组织暴动之“中央直辖挺进军第四军”副军长刘逆建勋等数人，已全部就擒，有关该案之官防、图章、印信、委任状及来往函件，亦全部查获。刘逆建勋经地方法院审讯，证据确凿，无可抵赖，已于廿三日枪决。据刘逆自供：“七七事变”后，彼即在天津充当日寇特务大队长，以绞杀人民抗日活动颇得日寇欢心。日寇投降后，复受蒋介石特务机关之收编宠信。去年蒋飞平时，曾亲自授命贺中华（北平行营中将参谋，抗战中为国民党第一师师长，河南战役曾被俘投敌）为“中央直辖挺进军”第四军军长，刘逆建勋为副军长，潜赴察省及张家口组织“地下军”相继蠢动。刘逆受命后，于去年十月间即来察省活动，企图集结伪军残部王继川、王玉林、于唤溪等至南口整编，特命进攻。并至大同进行联络，又至内蒙张北、宝源等地组织溃散之土匪伪军曹凯、徐海龙、徐老大、王林发、何重光等，及活动于蔚县、涿鹿一带的政治土匪黄锦荣、曹金玉、方存夫、杨万荣、郎占山等，协同配合暴动。最近北平行营给刘逆指示，要他在蒋军向平绥路东端开始进攻时，即由内部响应，配合进攻扰乱。此项阴谋活动为张市公安局侦悉后，即速予破获。
