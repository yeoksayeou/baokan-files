　　A Microcosm of the New Socialist Countryside in the Northeast Liberated Areas
    Sunjiawopu Farmers Near Harbin Love the Democratic Allied Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd] The experience of the liberated people of Sunjiawopu near Harbin is a microcosm of the development of the new socialist countryside in the Northeast Liberated Areas over the past year. There are more than 150 households in the village. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, most of the farmers in the village rented "official fields." In addition to "shipping" two-thirds of the harvest, they also had to provide labor for planting vegetables for the enemy and puppets, resulting in land wastelanding, and those who went out to beg for food accounted for one-third of the village.
    After the establishment of the democratic government, the civil affairs work team came to the village to help the masses organize the Farmers and Workers' Union, liquidated the "rationing shop," and elected four evaluation committee members to conduct land measurement. The village had a total of 157 hectares of land, and 700 people received an average of two mu of land per person. After the farmers got the land, they worked together with the village to pull rubber-wheeled carts, using five animals as a production team. By early May, all the land in the village had been planted with sorghum, millet, potatoes, and other crops. The farmers said, "This time the land is our own. We don't have to 'ship' the grain we harvest. When we are not busy in the fields, we can do some odd jobs, and we expect to have a surplus in our lives. In a few years, we can buy livestock to pull carts." Once, the Democratic Allied Army came to the village to borrow a few carts, promising to pay wages every day, but the farmers said that they would go even without wages. They automatically sent ten rubber-wheeled carts and fifty people. Later, when the Democratic Allied Army wanted to pay them wages, they had to accept them, saying, "The work of the Democratic Allied Army is our own work, so don't give us wages in the future." According to the farmer director, the people in the village love and help each other. Two soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army were disabled, and the Farmers' Association is responsible for providing them with support. More than 200 children are studying at Xiangfang Elementary School. The village's self-defense force has rifles and hand grenades. Farmers discuss matters through the Farmers and Workers' Union.

　　东北解放区新农村缩影
    哈市近郊孙家窝铺农民热爱民主联军
    【新华社哈尔滨二十二日电】哈市近郊孙家窝铺人民翻身的经历，是东北解放区新农村将近一年来发展的缩影。该村共有一百五十多户。在敌伪统治时期，村中多数农民租种：“官町”除将收获物三分之二“出荷”外，还给敌伪种菜支差，弄得土地荒芜，出走讨饭的人占全村三分之一。
    民主政府建立后，民运工作队到村里帮助群众组织起农工联合会，清算了“配给店”，选出四名评判委员，进行量地，全村共有一百五十七垧地，七百口人平均每人得二亩地。农民们分得地后，就与村里拉胶皮车的畜五变工。全村所有土地于五月初都种上了高粱、谷子、土豆等。农民们说：“这回地是我们自己的了，打了粮食也不用‘出荷’，地里不忙的时候，可作些零工，计算着生活还有富裕。几年后，我们可以买牲口拴车了。”有一次，民主联军到屯子里借几辆车用，答应每天给工钱，但农民们都说不给工钱我们也愿去，他们自动的去了十辆胶皮车，五十个人。后来民主联军要给他们工资，他们不得不收下时说：“民主联军的工作就是我们自己的工作，以后可别给工资了。”据农民主任谈：屯里人民都互助互爱。有两个民主联军残废了，由农会负责给养。二百多个孩子都在香坊小学读书。屯子里的自卫队有大枪、手榴弹。农民们有事都通过工农会商讨办理。
