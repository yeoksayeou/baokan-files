　　On Orthodoxism in Chinese History
    Jian Bozan
    In the study of Chinese history, there has long been a prevailing concept of orthodoxism. Orthodoxism means that in any era of Chinese history, a ruling group must be designated as the legitimate government to inherit the orthodox lineage, while other political groups coexisting in the same era as this legitimate government are considered illegitimate and usurping governments. For thousands of years, and even to this day, Chinese historians are still arguing about legitimacy and illegitimacy, and this concept of orthodoxism still plays a role in contemporary political life.

    In fact, the so-called orthodoxism is entirely a didactic argument used by feudal rulers to defend the legitimacy of their "family-owned world," and its starting point is the idea of "the emperor being supreme." Because historians in the feudal era believed that history was a continuation of sage emperors and enlightened rulers, they thought the world could not be without a ruler for even a day; a day without a ruler meant an interruption of history. Therefore, in any era, they had to find an emperor to attach to the orthodox lineage. This orthodox emperor was ideally a sage emperor and enlightened ruler, but if there was no such ideal emperor at the time, then regardless of whether he was a rogue, a hooligan, a bandit, a petty thief, or even a foreign race they despised as barbarians, as long as he gained control over China, he would be revered as sacred and regarded as orthodox.

    For example, before Liu Bang became emperor, he was a rogue who "loved beautiful women and coveted wealth," and he had also hidden in the Mangdang Mountains as a bandit. His identity could be described as both a rogue and a robber. However, the Records of the Grand Historian's "Biography of Emperor Gaozu" states that once he entered Xianyang, he transformed himself into a sage who "took no wealth and did not favor women." Zhu Wen was once referred to as a thief in the Old Book of Tang, but in the History of the Five Dynasties, he was revered as sacred. The Prince of Yan, Zhu Di, was previously referred to as a rebel in the History of Ming, but later he was honored as sacred. Li Cunxu, Shi Jingtang, and Liu Zhiyuan were all descendants of the Shatuo people, yet Chinese historians revered them as the orthodox lineage of the Five Dynasties. The rulers of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties were either Khitans, Jurchens, or Tatars, but Chinese historians revered them as ancestors. Such orthodoxism, where today's rogue becomes tomorrow's emperor, today's thief becomes tomorrow's saint, and today's enemy becomes tomorrow's ancestor, is rampant in Chinese historical records and too numerous to mention.

    On the one hand, historians in the feudal era held the idea that the world could not be without a ruler for even a day, but on the other hand, they also believed that there could not be two suns in the sky or two kings among the people, meaning that in the same era, there could not be more than one emperor. Therefore, if there were two or more emperors, they would choose one from among them, revere him as sacred, regard him as orthodox, and consider the rest as usurpers. For example, during the Three Kingdoms period, there were three sacred rulers, so historians either regarded Wei as orthodox or Shu as orthodox. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, there was a group of sacred rulers in the south and a group of sacred rulers in the north, so southern history referred to the northern sacred rulers as "captive barbarians," and northern history said the southern sacred rulers were "island barbarians." During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a large number of sacred rulers appeared in China, so historians selected the Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Zhou as orthodox. Such arbitrary orthodoxism, as Sima Guang said, "Since the Song and Wei dynasties, each had its own national history, mutually exclusive. The south called the north captive barbarians, and the north called the south island barbarians. When the Zhu family replaced the Tang, the four quarters were divided. When Zhu Xie entered Bian, he was compared to a desperate newcomer, the chronology of reigns was discarded and recounted. These are all biased words of self-interest, not universal theories of impartiality."

    Once a sacred ruler is determined, he becomes an inviolable symbol. If anyone opposes this sacred ruler, regardless of whether the opposition is justified, they are all labeled as robbers, thieves, bandits, rebels, or traitors. In reality, there is little difference between a sacred ruler and a thief. The difference between Chen Sheng and Wu Guang versus Liu Bang, the Green Woods Army and Red Eyebrows versus Liu Xiu, Dou Jiande and Liu Heita versus Li Shimin, Zhang Shicheng and Chen Youliang versus Zhu Yuanzhang, Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong versus the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, is actually very small. However, solely because of differences in success or failure, they are either sacred rulers or thieves. From this, it can be known that the distinction between sacred rulers and thieves does not lie in the character of the person, but in their success or failure. Correctly speaking, only from sacred rulers can true thieves be found, and only from "thieves" can true sacred rulers be found. Huang Lizhou said:

    "Since the Qin dynasty, all who have been emperors and kings have been thieves… Now, if someone carries several bolts of cloth or several dou of grain on the road, and someone kills them to take their cloth and grain, is that a thief? Or not a thief?… Killing one person to take their bolt of cloth and dou of grain is still called thievery, but killing all the people in the world and taking all their wealth of cloth and grain is not called thievery? Among those who have ruled the world well since the Three Dynasties, none is better than Han, yet Emperor Gao massacred Chengyang, massacred Yingyang, and Emperor Guangwu massacred three hundred cities… In ancient times, kings had to kill for two unavoidable reasons: they had to kill those who were guilty, and they had to kill in battle… If not for these, why kill? If they pass a village and destroy it, pass a market and scatter it, enter a city and massacre it, what is this for? Generals… partial generals… soldiers… kill people, and it is not the generals, partial generals, and soldiers who kill them, but the emperor who actually kills them. Officials kill them, and it is not the officials who kill them, but the emperor who actually kills them. Those who kill people have many hands, and the emperor is actually the biggest hand… The common people die in war or because of war, fifteen or sixteen out of ten, their bones are exposed and not collected, their cries have not ceased, and then they put on ceremonial robes, ride in the imperial carriage, sit in the front hall, receive congratulations, build high palaces, expand gardens, to honor their wives and concubines, to fatten their sons and grandsons. What heart do they have to bear to enjoy this? If God were to have me preside over the trial of murderers, I would know how to deal with them…" According to Huang Lizhou, the so-called sacred rulers since the Qin dynasty are all murderers, and Chinese historians have regarded the hereditary succession of murderers as orthodox, and those who oppose murderers as thieves. Isn't this a reversal of right and wrong! Therefore, Huang said again: "Then the greatest harm to the world is the ruler… And petty scholars regulate them with the righteousness of ruler and minister, with no escape between heaven and earth, to the point that even with the tyranny of Jie and Zhou, they still say that Tang and Wu should not have executed them… Is the vast world, among the millions of people, uniquely private to one person and one family!"

    Orthodox theorists, in general, deduce from the historical view of "the emperor being supreme," and in particular, they historically defend the legitimacy of the existing rulers. For example, regarding the Three Kingdoms, Chen Shou regarded Wei as orthodox, while Xi Zaochi regarded Shu as orthodox. Later, Sima Guang also regarded Wei as orthodox, and Zhu Xi again regarded Shu as orthodox. These different claims are not based on objective facts, but on historians subjectively defending their contemporary regime. Liang Qichao stated this very accurately, saying:

    "Chen Shou favored Wei, favoring the capital. Shou was born in the Western Jin, and the Western Jin occupied the old capital and had something to receive from above. If he did not favor the capital, then Jin would be a usurper. Therefore, Shou's orthodoxy of Wei was to legitimize Jin. Xi Zaochi favored Shu, favoring the bloodline. Zaochi was born in the Eastern Jin, and the Jin had already crossed south. If he did not favor the bloodline and still followed the capital, then Liu, Shi, Fu, and Yao would be orthodox, and Jin would be a usurper. Therefore, Zaochi's orthodoxy of Shu was also to legitimize Jin. Later, Wen Gong favored Wei, and Zhu Zi favored Shu. Wen Gong was in the Northern Song, and Zhu Zi was in the Southern Song. The Song's usurpation of Zhou and occupation of Bian was the same origin as the Jin's usurpation of Wei and occupation of Xu. Wen Gong's theory of favoring the capital was to legitimize Wei, to legitimize Song. The end of the Southern Crossing was the same illness as the Jin of Jiangdong. Zhu Zi's theory of favoring the bloodline was to legitimize Shu, to also legitimize Song. There has never been anyone who did not plan for the contemporary ruler."

    For example, the selection of the Later Liang, Later Tang, Later Jin, Later Han, and Later Zhou as orthodox during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period was also to defend the legitimacy of the Song dynasty's regime. Because the Song dynasty's regime was usurped from the Later Zhou, in order to legitimize the Song, it was necessary to legitimize Zhou, and in order to legitimize Zhou, it was necessary to legitimize the Liang, Tang, Jin, and Han. Therefore, the Song people's legitimization of the Liang, Tang, Jin, Han, and Zhou was also to defend the Song dynasty's regime as the orthodox lineage of history.

    The Manchus entered China as a foreign race and ruled it, similar to the situations of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties. Therefore, in the second year of the Shunzhi reign, when discussing the sacrificial rites of past emperors and kings, the Ministry of Rites submitted a memorial, advocating that the emperors of the Liao and Jin dynasties be placed on the sacrificial altar, almost making the Liao and Jin orthodox and the Song a usurper. The Qing people's legitimization of the Liao and Jin was also to defend the legitimacy of their own regime.

    In the early Republic of China, the Northern Warlords compiled the History of the Qing Dynasty, regarding the Manchu Qing as a sacred dynasty and referring to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as "rebel bandits," legitimizing the Manchu Qing and delegitimizing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Their reason for legitimizing the Manchu Qing and delegitimizing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was also to defend the legitimacy of the Northern Warlords' regime, which inherited the Manchu Qing, and to consider the Xinhai Revolution, which developed from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the Nationalist Party's regime established from it as usurpers.

    In recent times, some people have attempted to revere a certain individual as sacred and a certain party as orthodox. They have not hesitated to honor the traitor Zeng Guofan as a saint in order to deny the legitimacy of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Their intention is also to legitimize those who legitimized Zeng Guofan as legitimizing the current people's murderers, and to delegitimize those who delegitimized the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as delegitimizing the current people's army.

    In this way, the so-called orthodoxism is a tool to defend the legitimacy of the existing regime based on the principles of "the emperor being supreme" and "feudal hereditary succession." As Liang Qichao said, "If this is used to write history, how can it not lead the world to be beasts? And petty scholars still clamorously say, 'This is the principle of heaven, the righteousness of earth, the ethics of man, the foundation of the country, and the defense of the people.' I cannot but deeply detest and utterly reject it. The poisoning of the world by petty scholars is so deep." (Reprinted from "Democratic Weekly" Beijing Edition, Issue 20)

　　论中国史上的正统主义
    翦伯赞
    在中国历史学上，自古以来，就流行着一种正统主义的观念，所谓正统主义，即在中国史上的任何时代，都要指定一个统治集团，作为合法的政府，以之承继正统，而以与这个合法政府同时并世之其他的政治集团为非法的僭伪政府。几千年来，一直到现在，中国的史学家，还在哓哓于正伪之辩，而且这种正统主义的观念，在现在，仍然在现实的政治生活中，发生他的作用。
    其实所谓正统主义，完全是封建统治者用以辩护其“家天下”之合法的说教；而其出发点，则是“皇帝至上”的思想。因为封建时代的历史家，以为历史就是圣帝明王的承续，因而天下不可一日而无君，一日无君，即认为历史的中断。所以在任何时代，都要找一个皇帝，系之以正统。这个正统的皇帝，最好是圣帝明王，但是如果当时没有这样理想皇帝，则不管是流氓，是地痞，是大盗，是狗偷，甚至是他们鄙为夷狄的异族，只要他取得了对中国的统治权，他就被尊为神圣，被当作正统。
    例如刘邦未做皇帝以前，本是一个“好美姬，贪财货”的流氓，又曾隐于芒砀山为盗，他的身分，可以说流氓而兼强盗。但史记高帝纪谓其一入咸阳，便摇身一变而为“财货无所取，妇女无所幸”的圣人。朱温在唐书上曾被指为盗贼，而在五代史上，遂被尊为神圣。燕王棣在同一明史上，以前指为叛逆，以后又奉为神圣。李存昂，石敬塘，刘智远都是沙陀的苗裔，而中国的历史家竟奉为五代的正统。辽金元清诸代的统治者，或为契丹，或为女真，或为鞑靼，而中国的历史家，竟尊之为祖宗。像这样今日流氓，明日皇帝；今日盗贼，明日神圣；今日寇仇，明日祖宗的正统主义，充满了中国史乘、举不胜举。
    封建时代的历史家，一方面抱着天下不可一日而无君的思想，但同时又认为天无二日，人无二王，即认为在同一时代，不能有两个以上的皇帝。因而如果有了两个或两个以上的皇帝时，他们便从中选择一个，尊之为神圣奉之为正统，而以其余为僭伪。例如在三国时，有三个神圣，所以历史家或以魏为正统，或以蜀为正统。南北朝时，南方有一群神圣，北方也有一群神圣，所以南方的历史指北方的神圣为索虏，北方的历史说南方的神圣是岛夷。五代十国时，中国出现了一大批神圣，于是历史家便择定梁唐晋汉周为正统。像这样任意正伪的正统主义，正如司马光所云：“宋魏以降，各有国史，互相排黜。南谓北为索虏，北谓南为岛夷。朱氏代唐，四方幅裂，朱邪入汴，比之穷新，运历年代，弃而又数。此皆私己之偏辞，非大公之通论也。”
    神圣一经确定，则为不可侵犯之象征，如果再有人反对这个神圣，不管反对得有无理由，都一律被指为盗、为贼、为匪、为叛、为逆。实则神圣与盗贼，相去无几。陈涉、吴广之于刘邦，新市平林之于刘秀，宝建德刘黑闼之于李世民，张士诚陈友谅之于朱元璋，李自成张献忠之于清顺治，其间相差，实间不容发。然而即因成败不同，而遂或为神圣或盗贼。由此而知神圣与盗贼之分，不在其人之性格，而在其成败。正确的说来，只有从神圣中才能找到真盗贼，从“盗贼”中才找到真神圣。黄黎洲之言曰：
    “自秦以来，凡为帝王者皆贼也。………今也有负数匹布或担数斗粟而行于涂者、或杀之而有其布粟，是贼乎？非贼乎？………杀一人而取其匹布斗粟犹谓之贼，杀天下之人而尽有其布粟之富乃反不谓之贼乎？三代以后有天下之善者莫如汉，然高帝屠城阳，屠颖阳，光武屠城三百。…………古之王者，有不得已而杀者二：有罪不得不杀，临战不得不杀………非是奚以杀为？若过里而墟其里，过市而窜其市，入城而屠其城，此何为者？大将…………偏将………卒伍………杀人，非大将偏将卒伍杀之，天子实杀之。官吏杀之，非官吏杀之，天子实杀之。杀人者重众手，天子实为之大手。…………百姓死于兵与因兵而死者十五六，暴骨未收，哭声未绝，于是乃服兖冕，乘法驾，坐前殿，受相贺，高宫室，广苑囿，以贵其妻室妾，以肥其子孙，彼诚何心而忍享之？若上帝使我治杀人之狱，我则有以处之矣………”。如黄黎洲所云，则自秦以来的所谓神圣，都是一些杀人犯，而中国的历史家却以杀人犯之世代相承为正统，以反对杀人犯者为盗贼，岂不是非倒置！所以黄氏又说：“然则为天下之大害者君而已矣。………而小儒规焉以君臣之义，无所逃于天地之间，至桀纣之暴，犹以汤武不当诛之…………岂天下之大，于兆民万姓之中，独私一人一姓乎！”
    正统论者，一般方面，是“皇帝至上”的历史观之演绎，在特殊方面，他们又是历史地辩护现存统治者的合法。例如以三国而论，陈寿以魏为正统，而习凿齿则以蜀为正统；以后司马光又以魏为正统，朱熹复以蜀为正统。这样不同的主张，并不是根据客观的实事，而是历史家要主观地辩护其当时的政权。关于这一点，梁任公说得很正确，他说：
    “陈寿主魏，主都邑也。寿生西晋，西晋据旧都，而上有所受，苟不主都邑，则晋为僭矣。故寿之正魏，凡以正晋也。习凿齿主蜀者，主血胤也。凿齿生东晋，晋已南渡，苟不主血胤，而仍沿都邑，则刘、石、符、姚正、而晋为僭矣。故凿齿之正蜀，凡亦以正晋也。其后温公主魏，而朱子主蜀，温公北宋，而朱子南宋也。宋之篡周宅汴，与晋之篡魏宅许者同源，温公之主都邑说也，正魏也，凡以正宋也。南渡之末，与江东之晋同病，朱子之主血胤说也，正蜀也，凡亦正宋也。盖未有非为时君计也者。”
    又如五代十国而选择梁唐晋汉周为正统，这也是宋人为自己的政权辩护。因为宋代的政权，篡自后周，为了正宋，不能不正周，为了正周，于是又不能不正梁唐晋汉。所以宋人正梁唐晋汉周，也是为了辩护宋代政权是历史的正统。
    满清以外族入主中国，和辽金元的情形类似，所以顺治二年，议历代帝王祀典，礼部上奏，主张把辽金诸帝，送上祭坛，几几乎要以辽金为正统而以宋为僭伪。清人之正辽金，也是为了辩护自己政权的合法。
    民国初，北洋军阀修清史，以满清为圣朝而指太平天国为发匪，即正满清而伪太平天国。他们之所以正满清而伪太平天国，也是辩护承继满清的北洋军阀的政权是正统，而从太平天国发展出来的辛亥革命和由此而建立的国民党的政权是僭伪。
    晚近又有人企图把某一个人尊为神圣，某党派奉为正统。他们不惜尊奉汉奸曾国藩为圣人，以否定太平天国的合法性，其用意，也是企图以正曾国藩者正现在的人民屠杀者，以伪太平天国者伪现在的人民军。
    这样看来，所谓正统主义，就是以“皇帝至上”“封建世袭”为原则辩护现存的政权之合法性的工具。诚如梁任公云：“若以此而为史，安得不率天下而禽兽也？而陋儒犹嚣嚣然曰：‘此天之经也，地之义也，人之伦也，国之本也，民之防也。’吾不得不深恶痛绝，夫陋儒之毒天下也，如是其深矣。”（转载自《民主星期刊》北平版第二十期）
