	Taihang News in Brief
	To promote industrial construction, the Taihang Industrial Association, initiated in June, was formally established in Changzhi City on the 5th of this month. More than 30 representatives from Xingtai, Jiaozuo, Qinyang, Xiangyuan and other places attended the founding meeting, representing industries including electricity, coal mining, machinery, leather making, paper making, textiles, flour, and soap. Most of the factories and manufacturing companies in the Taihang area have joined the association. Hao Cheng, the representative of Shahe Company's kiln coal mine, Ma Wanghu, the representative of Xingtai fur industry, and seven other gentlemen were elected as executive members of the association. The founding meeting held discussions on labor-capital cooperation, expanding production, and developing industry, and decided to publish the monthly journal "Taihang Industry."
	In order to expand the publicity and mobilization of the patriotic self-defense war, Zuoquan County government has designated mid-September as publicity week. Cadres from various agencies and schools such as Zuoquan Middle School have formed propaganda teams to conduct publicity in the city, while rural primary schools are responsible for publicity in the four villages. The Education Section has also printed and distributed more than ten kinds of propaganda materials, including ditties, clapper talks, and promotional items. Mass blackboards and the public education center's broadcasts are very active.
	The Shangmin Night School run by the Changzhi City Businessmen's Association has opened, with more than 130 students. They are learning business operations, technology, relevant industrial and commercial policies and regulations, and common sense of current affairs and politics.

	The Tai Valley County Government has decided to issue textile loans of 500,000 yuan in advance, so that textile workers can obtain cheap cotton during the autumn harvest to store raw materials for large-scale textile production this winter.

	The Taihang Military Region's Pioneer Troupe is currently touring various places to conduct patriotic self-defense propaganda. The troupe has also drawn multiple maps of the national situation and various battlefields. While performing plays in rural areas, they also explain the situation of the patriotic self-defense war according to the maps, which is very popular among the masses.

	More than 30 village cadres and rural intellectuals in Zheng She Village, Licheng, recently organized a communications group to write articles for the Taihang Xinhua Daily, reporting on the village's production and construction work. The group also includes eleven members of the Women's Rescue Association, making them pioneers of rural women doing communications work for the newspaper.

	After the masses in Nanye Tao Village, Wu'an, turned over a new leaf, they cared about culture and education and have converted the village primary school into a privately run school. The masses organized a school board, allocating 50,000 yuan in silver dollars and 24 mu of land from the fruits of struggle as a fund. Currently, a large number of poor children are enrolling, and the three teachers already feel overwhelmed, so they have decided to hire another one.
