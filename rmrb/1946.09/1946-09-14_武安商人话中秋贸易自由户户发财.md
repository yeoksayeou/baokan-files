　　Wu'an Merchants Talk About Mid-Autumn Festival: Free Trade, Every Household Prosperous
　　During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the reporter visited some merchants in Wu'an. "Getting rich, getting rich" was their common conclusion. "What's the reason?" they said, "Free trade, without any controls, goes without saying, and the government is actively supporting it!" This spring, they received a large amount of loans from the government, with interest rates ranging from half to three cents, and they all said, "It's a great help." In addition, the government pays special attention to reducing taxes. Yuanhe Xing now earns 200,000 yuan a year, and the democratic government only levies 14,400 yuan in taxes, which is equivalent to one-thirteenth of its income. However, under the enemy and puppet regime, well-known donations such as business and ammunition taxes would cost 50,000 yuan a year, equivalent to one-quarter of its income.
　　Many bosses also told me that to make more money, you must have a long-term vision! Xu Zhaozhi, manager of Tongxingyong Porcelain Shop, said: We should sell more daily necessities to the common people, and we will definitely make more money. This porcelain shop used to sell Tangshan goods such as vases and jars for decoration, but now these non-essential items are not popular. He thought: No matter who it is, they have to use bowls for eating. So, this spring, he sold all his old goods at a low price and immediately went to Pengcheng to sell bowls and basins. In one month, he made a net profit of more than 20,000 yuan from a capital of 50,000 yuan. He started large-scale trafficking and can now import 4,000 to 5,000 yuan a day. He said, "Don't be afraid of small profits, as long as you sell more, running a few more trips is money."
　　Yuanhe Xing Pharmacy, in addition to the manager and doctor, has four shop assistants. Since the increase in capital, the shop assistants have been working very hard and are very obedient. Mr. Xu Yanghui, the manager, said, "If the relationship between the owner and the staff is good, we can make money. In the past, we gave the shop assistants too little money, so they didn't work hard. Now it's very different from before. The owner and staff have become a family, working together, and the business is getting better day by day." Their capital has increased from 10,000 yuan last winter to 55,000 yuan. The storefront has expanded from one to three. Now, in addition to reading and reading newspapers every night, the shopkeeper and staff sit together to review, to see who has any advantages and disadvantages, and how to develop and correct them. In addition to doing business in the shop, they also set up a small stall at the door. Since last winter, each share has earned from 500 yuan to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.
　　Wang, the shopkeeper of Desheng Heng Pickles Shop, said: Everyone working together can make big money. This small shop had a capital of 3,000 yuan when the enemy occupied it, and now it has become 600,000 yuan. Shopkeeper Wang said excitedly: This is because no matter the shopkeeper or the staff can work according to their needs. As a result, whether it is the front counter or the boiler and sauce tank room, everyone has become an all-rounder.

　　武安商人话中秋贸易自由户户发财
    过中秋节的时候，记者访问武安一些商人。“发财，发财”是他们共同的结论。“原因在那里呢？”他们说：“自由贸易，毫无统制是不用说了，政府还积极扶植呢！”今年春天，他们得到政府大批贷款，利息是分半到三分，都说：“就了大劲”。此外，政府特别注意减轻赋税，源和兴现在年可赚二十万元，民主政府只征税一万四千四百元，等于其收入的十三分之一，而在敌伪统制时，每年像营业、枪弹税等有名的捐项就要五万元，等于其收入的四分之一。
    许多老板还告诉我，要想多赚钱，还得有一些远大的眼光！同兴永磁器店经理徐照智说：应该多卖老百姓的日常必需品，一定可以多赚钱。他这个磁器店过去多是作摆设用的瓶瓶罐罐等唐山货，现在这些非必需品不大有人问津了。他想：无论什么人，总得用吃饭的碗。于是就在今春以低价卖完所存的旧货，马上到彭城贩碗盆，一个月的功夫，五万元本钱净赚两万多，他开始了大批的贩运，现在每天可进四五千元。他说：“不怕利小，只要卖的多，多跑两遭就是钱。”
    源和兴药铺除经理、医生外，有四个店员，自增资后，店员干得很带劲，又很听话，经理许养惠先生说，“东伙关系搞好了，就能赚钱，以前给店员钱太少，人家就不好好干，现在可和以前大不同啦，东家伙计成了一家人，合力经营，生意一天比一天好”。他们的资本由去冬的一万元变为五万五千元。门面由一间开成了三间。现在掌柜伙计每天晚上除读书看报外，就坐在一起检讨，看谁有什么好处和缺点，怎样发扬和纠正，他们除了作柜上的生意，还在门口摆个小摊，从去冬开始，每股已由五百元赚成五六千元。
    德盛恒酱菜铺王掌柜说：大家齐动手，就能赚大钱，这个小铺子，敌占时资本是三千元，现在已经变成了六十万，王掌柜很兴奋的说：这是因为不论掌柜伙计能根据需要去劳动，结果不管前柜或锅炉、酱缸房的人，都成了全把式。
