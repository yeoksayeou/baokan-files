　　Mid-Autumn Festival Echoes

    Hu Xiuming's Public Declaration Expresses Sincere Loyalty
    [Report from our newspaper in Changzhi, 11th] Hu Xiuming, a blacksmith worker from Tushitai Village, Tangyin, wrote a public declaration and posted it in the village before the Mid-Autumn Festival, expressing his joyful feelings after his liberation: "I, Hu Xiuming, was a person who suffered in the past. Because I had nothing to eat or wear, I fled in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After returning in the 25th year, I still couldn't make a living, so I went to Shanxi to escape the famine. Last year, I heard that the Eighth Route Army had arrived, so I brought my entire family of nine back. After rent reduction, debt liquidation, and wage increases, I had land to cultivate and a house to live in. Today, I have been liberated and I am very happy. I know that this is because of the leadership of the Eighth Route Army and the democratic government, which united all the peasants and workers in the village to overthrow the landlords and bullies. I, Hu Xiuming, have a debt of gratitude that is difficult to repay. From now on, I will reduce the price of my blacksmithing work for the villagers. If the government or the Eighth Route Army needs me to do work, I will go no matter what, to repay my gratitude. This is my special declaration." At the same time, he personally found cadre Wang Fengtian and said: "Please publish my statement in the newspaper during the Mid-Autumn Festival! I heard that people are comforting the Eighth Route Army soldiers at the front, and I want to express my feelings."
     Harbin Enthusiastically Supports the Army for Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th] Harbin has been enthusiastically holding Mid-Autumn Festival army support activities for days, filled with an atmosphere of unity between the army and the people. Workers and shop assistants from various industries have written to newspapers to thank and express their appreciation to the Democratic Allied Army. Citizens have suggested holding a military-civilian get-together. Theaters have been staging performances to entertain the garrison troops, and performers have donated money to support the army. On the 8th, the Harbin Army Support Brigade went to the garrison headquarters with a large number of comfort items. Chief of Staff Xiong of the headquarters thanked them on behalf of the Democratic Allied Army, expressing his respect for the people of Harbin's enthusiasm for caring for the army, and hoping that the people of Harbin would offer more criticisms of their troops. Mr. Li Guojun, Chairman of the Municipal Provisional Consultative Conference, believes that the army loving the people and the people supporting the army is as it should be, and listed many examples of the army listening to the people's suggestions and criticisms, praising their democratic style.

　　中秋余韵
    胡秀明告白表赤心
    【本报长治十一日电】汤阴土是台村铁匠工人胡秀明于中秋节前夕写了一告白贴在村中，表达他翻身后愉快的心情：“我胡秀明从前是受苦受难之人，因没吃没穿，民国十六年出外逃难。二十五年回来后，仍是无法生活，又去山西逃荒。去年听说八路来了，我就带上全家九口人回来。经过减租清债增加工资，我有了地种，有了房住，今天我翻了身，过的很高兴。我知道这是因为有八路军和民主政府的领导，使全村农民工人团结起来，打倒了地主恶霸。我胡秀明有恩难报，从今后我给村民打铁作活要减轻工价。如果政府八路军要我做活，我误下什么也要去，以报恩情，特此告白。”同时，他又亲自找到干部王逢田说：“中秋节你给我登登报吧！听说人家都慰劳前方八路战士，我也总要表示表示我的心意。”
