[Our Newspaper, Heze, 12th] Since the masses in the five districts of Jining City proposed to develop production and "combine handicraft industry with labor production," the masses have generally organized themselves. In addition to spinning cotton, wool, knitting socks, and milling in small groups, citizens throughout the district have also jointly established the Yimin Soap Cooperative and the Yumin Cigarette Cooperative. In the month since its opening, the cooperative has earned more than double its original capital. After deducting all expenses, the net profit was 322,020 yuan. It was decided that 10 percent of this profit would be used as a public fund, 5 percent would be used as a relief fund for poor cooperative members, and the remainder would be divided equally between labor and capital. After the settlement and dividend distribution, the morale of all service personnel in the cooperative has been further boosted. Recently, it was also decided to allocate a certain amount from the bonus as an incentive, and implement production incentive measures. The production quantity and quality of all cooperative members are recorded daily on designated forms, and the foreman is responsible for checking and proposing competitions. The slogan "Support the victory of the Patriotic Self-Defense War with production achievements" has also been put forward.
