We have already led our troops forward, vowing to fight to the end to achieve the realization of independence, peace, and democracy. Your Excellency is a respected elder of the Northwest and a pioneer of democracy. We ask that you bestow your wise counsel from time to time so that we may have guidance to follow.

　　朱总司令
    慰勉郝鹏举将军
    郝将军电复高树勋将军
    【新华社延安七日电】朱德总司令接获华中民主联军总司令郝鹏举将军痛斥国民党中央社造谣诬蔑的通电后，即致电郝将军表示慰勉之忱。朱总司令原电如下：郝总司令、毕副总司令、刘参谋长、赵副参谋长、乜师长、张师长、李师长、柳师长、李指挥官勋鉴，并转华中民主联军全体官兵均鉴：
    顷接九月三日通电，矢忠民主，义正词严，无任兴奋。反动派穷极无聊之鬼蜮伎俩，至是暴露于世界。解放区自卫战争方在开始，对卖国残民、背信弃义之反动派进犯军，决予以痛歼。光明在望，希一致努力，以求和平民主之最后实现。
                                                        朱德申虞叩。
    【本报讯】高树勋将军前曾电贺郝鹏举将军起义，郝将军等于九月二日电复高将军，电文如下：
    民主建国军高总司令建公赐鉴：辱承电贺，感奋交加。窃以卫国卫民，军人天职。鹏举等系属军人，受西北军之熏陶，大义在前，当仁不让，业经率部前进，誓奋斗到底，以争取独立和平民主之实现。我公西北名宿，民主先进，尚乞箴言时颁，俾有遵循。谨复致敬并申谢。   
   郝鹏举、毕庶文叩冬。
