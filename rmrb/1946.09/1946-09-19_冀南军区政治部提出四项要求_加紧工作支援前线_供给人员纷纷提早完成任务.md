　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 16th Dispatch] The Political Department of the Military Region, all military personnel, held a meeting a few days ago to discuss the call from the Military Region leaders to "intensify work to support the front lines," and put forward the following: (1) Strengthen the unity of the entire army and the unity between the army and the people, using the power of unity to defeat the reactionary派’s offensive. (2) Work with a spirit of urgency and intensify efforts; the few cadres remaining in the rear must do the work of three people. (3) Economize on food and clothing, reduce expenses, support the front lines, and enthusiastically participate in the autumn harvest. (4) Strengthen the study of current events, recognize the urgency of the current situation and the importance of our tasks, oppose an indifferent attitude towards the situation, be mentally prepared for long-term hardship, respond to the call of the Party and superiors with practical work, and strive for victory in the patriotic war.
　　[Another Dispatch] Staff members of the Military Region's Supply Department have completed their tasks ahead of schedule to support the front lines. After the × Clothing Depot's Associate Director Dong announced the conditions for model workers, he called on everyone to launch a competition to complete tasks, compete to become models, and in the tense atmosphere, Yin Yunsheng, the first squad leader, on behalf of the entire squad, proposed: 1. Guarantee completion of the task ahead of schedule; 2. Cancel the Sunday holiday system. The tailoring group leader said: "Our task was originally planned to be completed in a month and a half, but now we guarantee to complete it in one month." Then, the third squad leader, the odd-job group leader, and the second squad leader all spoke one after another, guaranteeing to complete the tasks ahead of schedule. The next day, a tense atmosphere filled the entire clothing depot, and each machine made two or three more sets of cotton clothes than usual. The first squad's five machines made eighty sets in one day, an average of six more sets per machine.
