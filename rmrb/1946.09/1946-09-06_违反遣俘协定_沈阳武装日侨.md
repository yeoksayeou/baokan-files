　　Violation of Repatriation Agreement
    Armed Japanese Nationals in Shenyang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th] Confirmed news: The Kuomintang authorities have recently incorporated Japanese nationals repatriated from Northeast Liberated Areas to drive them as cannon fodder in the civil war. After Japanese nationals repatriated from various liberated areas of North Manchuria and East Manchuria arrived in Shenyang, the Kuomintang authorities suddenly announced that all able-bodied young Japanese men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five would be retained. An armed Japanese force of more than 5,000 people has now been established there. This kind of evil action, violating the agreement on the repatriation of Japanese nationals, sabotaging peace in the Northeast, and using Japanese nationals to conduct civil war, should be urgently watched!

　　违反遣俘协定
    沈阳武装日侨
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】确息：国民党当局顷收编东北解放区遣送之日侨驱作内战炮灰。由北满、东满各解放区遣送之日侨到达沈阳后，国民党当局突宣布将十八岁到四十五岁之日侨青壮全部留下，现已在沈成立五千余人之日人武装。此种违反遣送日侨协定，破坏东北和平，利用日人进行内战之罪恶行动亟应警惕！
