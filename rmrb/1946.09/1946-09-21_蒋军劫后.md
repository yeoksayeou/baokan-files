　　After the Plunder by Chiang's Troops
    Qi Yu, Ximan
    White茅 Set

    After Chiang's 3rd Division invaded the liberated areas, they massacred our village cadres and families of soldiers on a large scale. Liu Da Niang and Li Da Niang, the head and deputy head of the Women's Rescue Association of Baimaoji (east of Kaocheng), were brutally shot by Chiang's troops in early September. Liu Da Niang had an only son who enlisted in the army eight years ago when our army first came to southwestern Shandong to persist in the Anti-Japanese War. For several years, he fought bloody battles with the Japanese invaders on the front lines to defend the motherland. Liu Da Niang has also served as the director of the Women's Rescue Association in Baimaoji for seven or eight years. During the Longhai Self-Defense Campaign, she actively mobilized young people to go to the front lines to carry the wounded and led all the members of the Women's Rescue Association in the village to recruit and care for the wounded. When Caihao was carried down from the front line and passed through Baimaoji, Liu Da Niang greeted Caihao very warmly, washing his face and feeding him, and saying with tears in her eyes: "Although my child has joined the Anti-Japanese War and there is no news, as long as I see our Eighth Route Army, it is like seeing my own child. The children were wounded by Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers, and I have to take good care of them, and you will go to the front line to fight Chiang's army after you recover." Under her influence, Baimaoji did a better job in carrying stretchers and transporting wounded soldiers than the surrounding villages. Unexpectedly, after Chiang's 3rd Division occupied the village, Wang Shuanzhu and Ma Xilai, special agents of the village, reported Liu Da Niang and Li Da Niang to Chiang's army, saying that they were communicating with the Eighth Route Army, were cadres of the Women's Rescue Association, and were also families of soldiers. Chiang's army tied Liu Da Niang and Li Da Niang together with a rope and paraded them in the surrounding villages as a warning, and finally executed them outside the south gate of Da Lizhai. When the Eighth Route Army completely annihilated the 3rd Division on September 6 and Da Lizhai was liberated again, the mothers of these two anti-Japanese warriors lay quietly in a pool of blood, their bodies already swollen. Liu Da Niang's daughter cried and cursed Chiang's army for being inhumane, killing her mother, and also asking the special agents to defraud her sister of two bolts of cloth prepared for making new clothes for her marriage in the name of redeeming her mother. Liu Da Niang's daughter swore in front of her mother's spirit: "I must avenge my old mother." After our military and political cadres arrived at Da Lizhai, they mobilized the people of the whole village to help collect the bodies. A blind family member of a soldier in Da Lizhai took the hand of Zhang Zihou, the Civil Affairs Section Chief of the military region, and said: "My son has also joined the Eighth Route Army for many years. I only heard that the 'Central Army' is bad, but I didn't expect it to be worse than the Japanese devils." Now in the area of Kaocheng, Caoxian, Dingtao and Heze in southwestern Shandong, in all the villages that have been occupied by Chiang's army, the people's clothes have been robbed, the pots have been smashed, the fruit trees have been cut down, and the sorghum ears have been taken as defensive works. Before leaving, Chiang's army even defecated and urinated in every pot in the house. The people were extremely indignant at the atrocities of Chiang's army, and everyone vowed that if Chiang's army came again, they would be wiped out. (Qi Yu)

    Da Yanghu
    The invading army only stationed in Da Yanghu for three days, but they devastated Da Yanghu, a village of 400 households, very tragically. After the victory of the Da Yanghu annihilation battle, reporters went to the village for inspection. Hundreds of meters away from Da Yanghu, the ground was covered with crisscrossing fortifications and trenches. Countless soldiers dressed in American-style yellow uniforms died in the fortifications. It was a pity that they died. If they had known earlier that Chiang Kai-shek had transferred them from southern Shaanxi to attack the liberated areas to fight a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek, they might have laid down their weapons and surrendered to the People's Army. Some of the dead were staring with their eyes open. I think they died too undeservedly, and they still couldn't rest in peace after death! Tens of thousands of trees within fifty meters of the village were completely chopped down, and the tree heads were facing outwards to form a strict deer village. A field of corn east of the village was also cut down. Outside the deer village was a pile of ashes, and inside the deer village was scattered with white wheat straw. The invading army burned all the grains and sorghum and all the firewood in the fields outside the village. After Lao Tai Tai Yan returned, she saw a pile of crops in the field turned into ashes, and cried and said: "A year's crops have been burned out, and several people in the family will have to starve to death!" Walking into the village, the tragic scene made people even more angry. No complete houses could be seen in the whole village. Some were demolished and used to build bunkers, and some walls were filled with holes, either gun holes or cannon holes. None of the doors of all the houses were installed on the door frames, and they were all demolished by the invading army to build fortifications. If you walk into a courtyard in Da Yanghu at random, you can connect to all the rooms in the village. After the invading army arrived in Da Yanghu, they added many new streets. These streets all passed through the walls of the houses. There was no complete land in the whole village, and it was densely covered with bunkers and fortifications, and intersecting artillery positions and machine gun positions. All the people's wheat, flour, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks were eaten. No geese, ducks, or chickens could be seen in the streets and ponds of Da Yanghu. Wang Gengshan told me: "His two bags of wheat and two buckets of corn were all eaten." Yang Lao Tai Tai said: "None of my fifteen sheep were left." Du Lao Tai Tai said: "My three chickens that were laying eggs were also eaten." No one could find a pot or a bowl in each household, and all the tables and benches were burned. It was really ten rooms and ten empty, and no one escaped the catastrophe of Chiang's army. After the recovery of Da Yanghu, more and more people returned home. Li District Chief of the Gengsheng District led the militia class of Da Yanghu and returned to Da Yanghu first. Li District Chief cordially comforted the people who returned from the refuge. The militia class maintained the order of the whole village. Du Chuanli, the head of the militia class, told me: "When the enemy came, we fought with them first, covered the evacuation of the people of the whole village, and then we retreated. Although the enemy has ravaged our home beyond recognition, we finally wiped out all the enemies here." (Ding Man)

　　蒋军劫后
    齐语西曼
    白茅集
    此次蒋军第三师进犯解放区后，大肆屠杀我村干部及抗属。白茅集（考城以东）妇救会正副主任刘大娘、李大娘于本月初旬惨遭蒋军枪杀。刘大娘有一个独生子，八年前当我军刚来鲁西南坚持抗日的初期，他就首先报名参军，几年来在抗日前线上与日寇血战保卫祖国。刘大娘在白茅集担任了妇救会主任也有七八年的历史，此次陇海自卫战役，她积极的动员青壮年上前线抬伤兵，领导全村妇救会员招护伤员。彩号从火线上抬下来经过白茅集时，刘大娘见了彩号非常亲热的替彩号洗脸喂饭，并挥着眼泪说：“俺孩子虽然参加抗战没有音信，我只要看见咱八路军就像看见我自己的孩子一样。孩子们被蒋介石兵打伤了我得好好照顾，你们把伤好了再上前线打蒋军。”在她的影响下，白茅集此次抬担架转运伤兵的工作作的比周围村庄都好。不料当蒋军第三师占领该村后，该村特务分子王拴柱、马喜来把刘大娘及李大娘报告给蒋军，说她们通八路，是妇救会干部又是抗属，蒋军就把刘大娘和李大娘拴在一条绳子上在周围村庄游行示众，最后把她们枪决于大李砦的南门外。当八路军于九月六日将第三师全部消灭，大李砦重获解放时，这两位抗日战士的母亲静静的躺在血泊中，全身已经浮肿。刘大娘的女儿抱头痛哭，大骂蒋军惨无人道，杀了她的母亲，还叫特务们以赎她母亲为名，骗走了她妹妹准备出嫁作新衣的两匹布。刘大娘的女儿在她母亲的灵前宣誓说：“我一定要为我的老母亲报仇。”我军政干部赶到大李砦后，动员全村的老百姓帮助收殓。大李砦一个瞎了眼的抗属，拉着军区民运科长张子厚同志的手说：“我的儿子也参加八路军多年了，我光听说‘中央军’歪，不想歪得比日本鬼子还厉害。”现鲁西南考（城）曹（县）定（陶）荷（泽）一带，凡是遭受蒋军侵占过的村庄，老百姓的衣服被抢，盆盆被砸，果木树被砍光，高粱谷穗被拿作工事防御物，蒋军临走时在每家锅里还拉上屎尿，老百姓对蒋军如此暴行万分愤慨，大家纷纷宣誓蒋军再来一定要把他们消灭个干净。（齐语）
    大杨湖
    进犯军在大杨湖仅仅驻扎了三天的时间，然而他们把四百户的大杨湖破坏的十分悲惨。大杨湖歼灭战结束以后，记者前往该村视察，距大杨湖百十米达的地方，遍地是横三竖四的工事和壕沟，无数穿着美国式的黄色服装的士兵死在工事里，他们死的太可惜了，他们假使早了解到蒋介石把他们从陕南调来进攻解放区是替蒋介石打卖国内战，他们或者早放下武器投到人民军队方面来。死者有些是睁着眼睛的，我想他们或者死得太不值得，在死后还不瞑目吧！在距村庄五十米达内的几万颗树木，完全被斫光，树头朝外筑成了一道严密鹿砦。村东面的一片玉蜀黍也被砍光。鹿砦外一片片的灰烬，鹿砦内撒满了一片白色麦秸，进犯军把村外场里所有的谷子高粱等庄稼和全部柴草全烧光。阎老太太回去后，看到场里的一堆庄稼变成了一片灰烬，痛哭着说：“一年的庄稼被烧光，家里几口人还不得饿死！”走进村庄以后，那种悲惨景象更使人愤怒，全村看不到一座完整的房屋，有的被拆毁修筑了堡垒，有的墙壁上被挖满了洞，不是枪眼就是炮眼，所有房屋没有一扇门安在门框上，都被进犯军拆毁筑工事去了。你随便走进大杨湖的一处院子里，即可接连着串通全村的房间。进犯军到大杨湖后，给新增加了很多条街道，这些街道全是从房屋的墙壁穿过的。全村庄也看不到一块完整土地，到处密布着堡垒和工事，交叉着的炮兵阵地和机关枪阵地。所有群众的麦子、面粉、猪、羊、鸡、鸭都被吃光，大杨湖的街道上水池里，看不见一只鹅、鸭、鸡子。王更善告诉我说：“他的两布袋麦子和二斗玉蜀黍，全被吃光了。”杨老太太说：“俺的十五只羊吃的一只也没剩下。”杜老太太说：“我的三个鸡正下着鸡蛋也给吃了。”各户见不到一口锅和一个碗，桌子凳子全被烧光，真是十室十空，没有一家脱逃蒋军的浩劫。收复后的大杨湖，回家的群众渐渐多起来，更生区李区长带领大杨湖的民兵班，首先回到大杨湖，李区长向逃难回来的群众亲切慰问，民兵班维持着全村的秩序，民兵班长杜传礼告诉我说：“敌人来时我们先跟他们打上了，掩护着全村群众逃出后，我们也退了，敌人把我们的家虽然遭踏的不像样了，但咱们最后也把敌人全部消灭在这里了。”（丁曼）
