Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th - Manila News: Since the 2nd of this month, the Philippine government army and the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army have launched a full-scale civil war in central Luzon. The sound of artillery fire can be heard in Manila, and the situation is extremely tense. The center of the war is north of Manila, where the Philippine government army is constantly using American artillery and aircraft to bombard peaceful villages. Since Philippine President Roxas issued a "suppression" order against the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army on September 2, the United States has provided the Philippine government with a batch of "surplus materials" as aid. According to the Central News Agency, this batch of materials is the largest transfer in Philippine history, estimated to be worth 150 million US dollars, sold at only 21.4% of the original price.

　　美国支持菲岛内战
    【新华社延安十八日电】马尼拉讯：自本月二日起，菲政府军与菲人民抗日军在吕宋中部展开全面内战，马尼拉市内时闻炮声，情况至为紧张。战事中心在马尼拉以北，菲政府军不断以美国大炮及飞机轰击该地的和平村庄。自九月二日菲总统罗哈斯向菲人民抗日军下“讨伐”令后，美国又以一批“剩余物资”援助菲政府。据中央社称：此批物资为菲律宾历史上最大一次之转让，估计共值一亿几千五百万美元，售价仅及原价之百分之二十一点四。
