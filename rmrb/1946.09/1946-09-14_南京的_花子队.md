　　Nanjing's "Ragtag Gang"

　　When "Ragtag Gang" is mentioned, no Nanjing citizen doesn't have a headache. Especially in bustling areas like Xin Jie Kou and Fu Zi Miao, restaurant, cafe, theater, and brothel owners fear their visits the most. They are often disturbed by the "Ragtag Gang's" masters and have to bow and scrape, apologizing to them, otherwise, "disaster will descend," and they might suffer some hardships.

　　The "Ragtag Gang" can be so unreasonable in the capital city, and it has its origins. Here, I will write what I know below:

　　"Ragtag Gang" is not their original name. This is an honorary title given to them by the citizens of Nanjing. They are Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, disciples of Dai Li. To facilitate lurking among the common people, they specially designed a peculiar costume—cotton military uniforms, with who knows how many holes and oil stains on them. Old cotton wadding, like intestines, hung in strings outside the clothes. A foul odor emanated from the seams, making people nauseous. In addition, there were two personal treasures: an automatic rifle and a revolver, one long and one short, both made in the United States. With this outfit, coupled with their rascal-like behavior similar to beggars, the Nanjing citizens named them "Ragtag Gang," which is most appropriate.

　　In mid-August last year, just when Japan surrendered, the "Ragtag Gang" was sent to Nanjing to work. Unexpectedly, these "ragtags," upon arriving in Nanjing, swaggered down the street, flaunting their power, believing they had a "special mission."

　　Once, a large group of "ragtags" walked into a tavern, played guessing games, and ate and drank heartily. When it was time to pay, they took out a hundred yuan, saying it was for small expenses, and the meal cost should be put on the tab and settled later. The boss got anxious, grabbed a "ragtag's" tattered military coat, and tore off a large piece of cotton. This angered the "ragtags," and not only did they beat up the boss, but they also tried to tie him up and send him away. When the military police arrived and asked them what unit they were from, they took out the symbol of the "Military Statistics Bureau ×× Action Detachment," and the military police did not dare to question them further. They had no choice but to mediate, and as a result, the boss repeatedly begged, apologized, and admitted his mistakes before the matter was settled.

　　Another time, several "ragtags" went to a brothel and played with a prostitute, making her unable to cope. They then beat the prostitute in the name of not knowing how to entertain guests. At the time, someone came out and said a few fair words, but as a result, he was taken away on the charge of being a "bad element," and it was said that he was buried alive.

　　Such things are commonplace in Nanjing and are not surprising, but the authorities have not been seen to stop the "Ragtag Gang's" evil deeds. However, currently, these "Ragtag Gang" members have disappeared in Nanjing, perhaps because their concealment skills were not high enough, exposing their "special agent mission," and were called back by their leader for retooling.

　　But no matter how they change, they will eventually reveal their fox tails, and besides, a man-eating jackal itself has a beastly appearance that is difficult to disguise.

### 南京的“花子队”

　　南京的“花子队”
    木石
    提起“花子队”，南京市民没有一个不头痛的，尤其在新街口，夫子庙一带比较热闹的地方，饭馆、咖啡店、戏院子、窑子的老板们最怕他们光顾，往往被“花子队”的老爷们搅扰一场，还得打躬作揖，向他们赔小心，否则，“祸从天降”，说不定会吃到什么苦头。
    “花子队”能在堂堂首都如此横蛮无理，自有他的来历，这里尽我所知道的写在下面：
    “花子队”，并不是他原有的名称，这是南京市民赠给他们的尊号，他们是蒋记特务，是戴笠的徒子徒孙，为了便于潜伏在老百姓群里，特别设计了一身奇异的服装——棉军服，上面不知有多少窟窿和油污，旧棉絮像肠子似的，一串一串吊在衣服外面。难闻的臭气，从绽缝里散发出来，使人作呕。另外，还有两件随身宝贝；一支自动步枪和一支左轮枪，一长一短，都是美国造，他们这一身打扮，配上那种跟叫花子一样无赖的作为，南京市民给取名叫“花子队”，是再合适不过的了。
    去年八月中旬，正是日本投降的当儿，“花子队”被派到南京来工作，不料这些“花子”们一到南京，自以为负有“特种使命”，便在街上大摇大摆，抖起威风来了。
    有一次，一大群“花子”走进一家酒馆，猜拳行令，大吃大喝，临了，拿出一百块钱说是算小账，饭钱叫记上账，日后再说，老板着了急，一把拉住一个“花子”的破军衣，把棉衣扯了一大块下来，这一下，可火了“花子”们，大伙儿揍了老板一顿不说，非要把他捆起来送走，宪兵来了问他们是那一部分，他们拿出“军统局××行动大队的符号，宪兵也不敢多加追问，只好从中解劝，结果是老板再三哀求，陪罪认错，才算了事。
    又有一次，好几个“花子”去逛窑子，把一个妓女耍得莫可奈何，无法应付，他们便在不会招待客人的名义下，将妓女毒打了一顿。当时，有一个人出来说了几句公平话，结果便在“不良分子”的罪名下，给带走了，据说是被活埋了。
    像这类事情，在南京已经司空见惯，不足为奇，但却没有见到当局对“花子队”的恶行有所制止，不过，目前，这些“花子队”在南京已经匿迹了，也许是因为他们隐伏的技巧不高明，暴露了自己的“特务任务”，而被他们的头子，叫了回去，重新改装。
    但无论他们怎样变，终久会露出狐狸尾巴，何况吃人的豺狈，它本身就是一副难以乔装的兽相。
