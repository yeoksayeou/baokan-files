　　After the Repatriation of Japanese Nationals is Complete
　　Harbin Allocates Japanese Residences
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th] After the complete repatriation of Japanese nationals in the North Manchuria region, the Democratic Allied Army's Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners Office and the Harbin Municipal Government have allocated 4,356 Japanese houses, comprising 20,002 rooms, to homeless poor people. In recent days, impoverished masses from various places have organized evaluation committees to conduct their own evaluations. The poor people who have been allocated houses are busy moving into their new homes, and many are immediately starting construction. Confiscated Japanese materials in Harbin are being exclusively sold by an evaluation and sales committee organized by the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The proceeds from the auction are entirely used for municipal construction expenses.

　　日侨遣送完毕后
　　哈市分配日人住所
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】北满地区日侨全部遣送完毕后，民主联军遣送日侨俘办事处与哈市市政府，已将日人房屋四千三百五十六所，二万零二间分配与无房贫民。连日各地贫苦群众纷纷组织评议委员会，自行评议。分得房屋之贫民，正忙着搬入新居，许多人马上开始建筑。哈市没收日人物资，则经由商工公会组织估贩委员会专卖，拍卖所得，悉充市政建设经费。
