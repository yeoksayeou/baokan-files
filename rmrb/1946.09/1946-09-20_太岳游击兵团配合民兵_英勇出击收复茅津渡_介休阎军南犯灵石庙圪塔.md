　　Taiyue Guerrilla Corps, Coordinating with Militia,
    Valiantly Counterattacks and Recovers Maojindu
    Yan's Army from Jiexiu Invades Miaogeta in Lingshi
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 17th dispatch] After the Xi'an meeting of war experts Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan, Hu Zongnan actively transferred troops to the southern Shanxi front. As the local forces transferred from the Mianchi area of Henan Province gradually crossed the Yellow River and entered the southern Shanxi area, Hu Zongnan transferred the 167th Brigade (formerly a division) stationed in the Quwo and Yicheng areas. On the 13th, it coordinated with more than 3,000 Yan-puppet troops from Linfen and attacked northward in four routes. One route launched a fierce attack on our army's position at Ta'er Mountain on the border of Linfen and Fushan; another route attacked eastward from Mengcheng, occupying Nanji and Laoguanzhuang south of Ta'er Mountain; another route advanced southeastward from Zhaoqu via Taosi; and another route advanced from Linfen, occupying Baotou and Chenli, and continued to advance towards Wohu Mountain. Our Taiyue military and civilians, in addition to blocking the invading troops head-on, also advanced into the rear of the Jiang army's occupied areas. On the evening of the 16th, our guerrilla corps, in conjunction with the militia in the Pinglu area, launched surprise attacks on five Jiang army strongholds simultaneously, including Pinglu city, Maojindu, Taiyangdu three miles south of Pinglu, Dacheng Village twenty miles northeast, and Shengrenjian ten miles north of Maojindu, with lightning speed. The Jiang army's garrison troops in the area were extremely panicked. The Taiyangdu police station and more than 30 plainclothes agents of the 38th Division were completely annihilated by our guerrilla corps, and 18 rifles and 1 machine gun were seized. Maojindu was immediately recovered by our guerrilla corps. Maojindu is an important crossing point for the Jiang army to transfer troops north to expand the civil war in Shanxi Province. This time, it was recovered by our guerrilla forces behind enemy lines, giving the northern invading Jiang army a major check.
    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 17th dispatch] Yan Xishan's troops of Sun Chu's department, concentrated in the Jiexiu area, coordinated with the Jiang-Yan joint army invading north from Linfen. With about five regiments of its 45th Division, 44th Division, and 73rd Division, carrying six mountain guns, they launched a fierce attack on Miaogeta, forty miles north of Lingshi city, and Zhanduan @, thirty-five miles northeast of the city, in three routes on the morning of the 13th, and two airplanes cooperated in the battle.

　　太岳游击兵团配合民兵
    英勇出击收复茅津渡
    介休阎军南犯灵石庙圪塔
    【本报阳城十七日电】内战专家阎锡山、胡宗南代表西安会议后，胡宗南即积极抽调兵力，投入晋南前线。当其由河南渑池一带增调的地方团队，陆续北渡黄河进入晋南地区，胡宗南即将其进占曲（沃）翼（城）地区之一六七旅（原师改称）抽调出来，十三日配合临汾之阎伪军三千余人，分四路北犯，一路向临（汾）浮（山）边境塔儿山我军阵地猛攻；一路由蒙城东犯，占我塔儿山南麂、老官庄；一路由赵曲经陶寺向东南进犯；另一路由临汾进占堡头、陈李后，继续向卧虎山进犯。我太岳军民除正面于进犯军阻击外，并向蒋军占领区后方进军。十六日晚我某游击兵团与平陆一带民兵结合，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，同时向平陆城、茅津渡及平陆南三里之太阳渡、东北廿里之大臣村、茅津渡北十里之圣人涧等五个蒋军据点，展开奇袭作战。该地蒋军守备部队恐慌异常，太阳渡警察所及三十八师便衣特务三十余人，为我游击兵团全部歼灭，缴获步枪十八枝，机枪一挺，茅津渡当即为我游击兵团所恢复。按茅津渡为蒋军调兵北渡扩大晋省内战之重要渡口，此次为我敌后游击队所恢复，予北犯蒋军以重大牵制。
    【本报阳城十七日电】集结介休一带阎军孙楚部与自临汾北犯之蒋阎联军南北呼应，以其四十五师、四十四师、七十三师约五个团兵力，携带山炮六门，于十三日清晨分三路猛犯我灵石城北四十里之庙疙瘩及城东北三十五里之斩断＠等地，并有飞机两架配合作战。
