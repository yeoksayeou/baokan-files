Xinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 3rd—Chiang Kai-shek's troops have begun their civil war actions to invade the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area. The 12th and 53rd armies, transported by American ships to Qinhuangdao, increased to the Linyu line on the 27th of last month. On the same day, they invaded Yiyuankou, a key pass of the Great Wall, and on the 28th, they fell into Shuangshan and Dushan (i.e., Qinglong) and other places, with the intention of opening up the Lingyuan-Luanxian Highway. Another Chiang army, a regiment of the 62nd Division, increased from Qinhuangdao along the Beining Railway to Luanxian, gathered local troops to commit crimes against the 13th Sub-district of the Beining Railway Liberated Area in separate ways, and has invaded Nanfanzhuang Macheng, southeast of Leizhuang Station, and the ＠ city, where the 12th Special District is located, with a strong occupation of Leting in sight. A regiment of the 5th Division of the Chiang Army in Tangshan, in coordination with the invading Chiang Army in Luanxian, also went out to harass the east of the road and has trapped Songjiaying, a village in the Liberated Area. On the western front, Chiang's troops in Xianghe, ignoring the temporary cessation of conflict agreement signed by the 25th Executive Group, continued to provoke along the Baihe River. On the 26th at 8:00 AM, Chiang's troops in Chenchongdian, southwest of Xianghe, used machine guns to strafe the Eighth Route Army position across the river. On the 27th, Chiang's troops in Hongmiao Maocaodian shelled the Eighth Route Army驻地 in Erbaihu, and on the same day, Chiang's troops in Yin Jiahe, northeast of the wharf, disturbed Dashawu and bombarded the Eighth Route Army positions in Nan Wu Village and Xihe in Jiangan River. In response to this provocative behavior by Chiang's troops, the 14th Military Sub-district Command of the Eighth Route Army in Eastern Hebei has submitted a memorandum to the Beiping Executive Department, requesting that Chiang's troops occupying the Hongmiao line be ordered to withdraw to facilitate investigation. Statistics show that the Chiang army's military force invading the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area has reached more than 100,000, including the 21st, 142nd, and 56th divisions of the 92nd Army, the 121st and 5th divisions of the 94th Army, the 62nd Army, the 12th Army, and the 116th Division of the 53rd Army. The military and civilians in Eastern Hebei have urgently completed various self-defense preparations, vowing to strike back at the invaders. Regarding Chiang's provocation this time, General Zhan Caifang, Commander of the Eastern Hebei Military Region, and General Li Chuli, Political Commissar, have urgently telegraphed the Beiping Military Mediation Department to stop it immediately in order to make Chiang's army aware of it. Otherwise, Chiang's side will be solely responsible for the serious consequences.
