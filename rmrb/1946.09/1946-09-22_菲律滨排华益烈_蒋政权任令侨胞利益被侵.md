Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th. Manila Dispatch: The Senate passed the second anti-Chinese bill, the "Filipinization of Labor" bill, on the 16th. This bill stipulates that in any foreign-owned enterprise, company, or store, 60% of the employees must be Filipinos. If it hinders the employment of Filipinos, no foreign national may be employed in the Philippines. Violators will be fined 10,000 Philippine pesos (equivalent to over 10 million legal tender) or face five years of imprisonment. After the passage of this bill, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese will be expelled from Chinese-run enterprises and shops. The previously passed (late August) "Filipinization of Public Markets" bill has already resulted in the exclusion of thousands of overseas Chinese. Currently, the Philippine Congress is discussing an even larger-scale anti-Chinese bill, the "Filipinization of Retail Trade" bill. Once all three bills are passed, it will be equivalent to eliminating half of the interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. In July, before the aforementioned three bills were passed, people from all walks of life in the Philippines had already approached Gan Naiguang, the special envoy sent by the Nanjing government to the Philippines to celebrate "independence," requesting the Nanjing government to protect overseas Chinese and prevent the Philippine authorities from passing the above three bills. However, the Chiang Kai-shek government has shown no concern for the interests of overseas Chinese and has remained indifferent to this unreasonable behavior by the Philippine government.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th. According to the Associated Press Manila dispatch: A petition has recently been received here condemning the abuses of local people by the US military on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines under the terror rule of Philippine President Roxas. It also condemns the US military's large-scale searches of Filipino families and illegal detention of Filipino people. The petition stated: US military police often search Filipino houses. The US military is not limited to doing so on their bases and often goes to areas that are not under their jurisdiction.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 18th. According to United Press Manila dispatch: After Laurel, the puppet president of the Philippines during the Japanese occupation, was extradited back to the Philippines from Japan for trial in July, he told the Philippine People's Court on the 4th of this month that Roxas had cooperated with Japan and is now the President of the Philippines, requesting the court to have a fair understanding of this. He said: Roxas and others cooperated with me but were still elected president. "I ask the court to have a fair judgment." It is reported that Roxas served under Laurel in 1944 as a minister without portfolio and director of the puppet Economic Planning Bureau. In the same year, he urged the Philippine government to declare war on the Allies to please the Japanese invaders. However, the US authorities, in order to suppress the Filipino people, have elevated him to be the President of the Philippines.

　　菲律滨排华益烈
    蒋政权任令侨胞利益被侵
    【新华社延安十八日电】马尼拉讯：参院十六日通过排华的第二法案“劳工菲化”法案。该法案规定任何外国人的企业公司、商店，其职工百分之六十必须是菲律滨人，倘若防碍菲人的就业，任何外侨不得在菲岛受雇做工，违者将罚款菲币一万元（合法币一千余万），或五年的监禁。此案通过以后，数万华侨即将从中国人经营的企业、商店内被驱逐出来。前次（八月下旬）通过的“公共市场菲化”法案，业已使数千华侨遭受排斥。目前菲国会正在讨论一更大规模的排华法案“零售业菲化”法案。以上三案全部通过以后，便等于华侨在菲利益被排除一半。菲岛华侨各界人士，早在七月间上述三案未被通过之时，即向南京政府赴菲庆祝“独立”的特使甘乃光提出，要求南京政府保护华侨，阻止菲当局通过上述三项法案，但蒋介石政府对华侨的利益毫不照顾，对菲政府此种无理行为漠然置之。
    【新华社延安十八日电】据美联社马尼拉讯：此间最近接获一岛申请书，谴责在菲总统罗哈斯的恐怖统治下，美军于菲律滨南部巴拉旺岛的虐待地方人士行为，并责难美军大规模搜查菲人家属，非法扣留菲岛人民。申请书称：美宪兵常到菲人的房屋去搜查，美军不限于在其基地如此，且经常到不是他们管辖的地区去。
    【新华社延安十八日电】据合众社马尼拉讯：日寇占领期间的菲律滨伪总统罗列尔于七月自日引渡返菲审判后，本月四日在菲人民法庭上对于罗哈斯曾和日本合作、而现在却任菲总统一事，要求法庭应有公正的认识，他说：罗哈斯等和我合作，但仍当选为总统，“我请求法庭上应有公正的评判”。按罗哈斯于一九四四年曾在罗列尔之下任不管部长与伪经济计划局长，并于同年促菲政府对盟国宣战，以取悦于日寇。但美当局为了镇压菲人民，竟把他抬出来当菲总统。
