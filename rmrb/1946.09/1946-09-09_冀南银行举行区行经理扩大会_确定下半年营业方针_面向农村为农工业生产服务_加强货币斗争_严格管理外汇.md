　　Jinnan Bank Holds Expanded Meeting of District Branch Managers
    Determines Operational Policy for the Second Half of the Year
    Serves Rural Areas and Agricultural and Industrial Production
    Strengthens Monetary Struggle
    Strictly Manages Foreign Exchange
    [Report from this Newspaper in Handan] At the Second Expanded Meeting of District Branch Managers held by the Jinnan Bank's Head Office in the middle of last month, the tasks and policies for the bank's work in the second half of the year were clearly defined as: serving rural areas and cities for agricultural and industrial production, strengthening foreign exchange management, conducting monetary struggle, and implementing enterprise management in the bank. Regarding the bank's most fundamental policy, namely serving rural areas, it was generally agreed that since the bank serves the entire economic construction, it should focus on rural areas. In the second half of the year, the majority of manpower and resources should be placed in rural areas to carry out four tasks: First, in areas where general cooperatives already have a foundation, develop credit cooperative work to support the masses' own lending relationships, invigorate rural finance, establish the bank's mass foundation in rural areas, and integrate banking business with mass production. Second, issue a large number of loans after the autumn harvest, mainly for agriculture, handicrafts, and textiles, followed by household sideline occupations and cooperative marketing, to cooperate with the major production campaign next spring. Third, strive to recover all old loans after this autumn. Fourth, establish agricultural warehouses to adjust seasonal price differences and currency circulation. To meet the needs of the border region's economic construction, the bank will increase investment in industrial, mining, and transportation industries on the basis of not relaxing existing industrial and mining industries, to support the development of industrial and mining industries.
    Because our cities serve rural agricultural and industrial production, the bank must: actively support the development of urban handicrafts, factories, workshops, and cooperative transportation, mainly use loans to support production, and focus on short-term, small-scale loans. As long as urban commerce is in line with our trade policy, adopt a supportive approach. Strengthen the organization and guidance of silver shops, and promote their transformation; support the development of mass-based credit cooperative silver shops in general small cities.
    To strengthen the monetary struggle, foreign exchange should be strictly managed. First, consolidate the value of the local currency and expand the local currency market. On the one hand, tighten issuance, stabilize prices, and develop production; on the other hand, establish an independent and autonomous price policy and strengthen the management of the financial market. Second, strictly manage foreign exchange, cooperate with the Industrial and Commercial Bureau to manage import and export trade, and strive for import-export balance and even surplus. Third, launch a campaign against counterfeit banknotes. The struggle against counterfeit banknotes should be regarded as one of the important tasks of the struggle against the stubborn enemy, creating a mass movement against counterfeit banknotes.
    Regarding interest rate policy. During the war, production shrank and inflation occurred, forming an abnormal trend of increasingly high commercial profits and increasingly low industrial profits. Therefore, our interest rate policy should play an active guiding role to change this trend. Specific methods: First, we should start from the overall situation and use a large number of loans for industrial production. Developed production, consolidated currency value, stable prices, and economic prosperity are beneficial to the entire liberated area. Second, appropriately increase interest rates to increase the number of depositors and increase the amount of funds. This is beneficial to both the bank and the masses. Third, adjust industrial and commercial profits, helping the weak: The first method is to develop credit cooperatives. The principles for organizing credit cooperatives should be: "Unified collection of shares, overall profit sharing, independent funds, and specialized business operations." Another method is to increase commercial loan interest rates to compensate for losses on loans to farmers. The purpose of implementing bank enterprise management is: First, to implement regular management, improve technology, and improve work efficiency. Second, to achieve self-reliance in order to reduce the burden on the people.
    Finally, Vice Chairman Rong, in his concluding report, explained to everyone that next year's major production campaign is the second revolution carried out by farmers after they have obtained land. Without it, the rural economy cannot develop, farmers cannot truly turn over, and the victory of the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot be won. Vice Chairman Rong finally called on all bank cadres to be what they should be, to learn from the good style of merchants who are kind and easy to attract the masses, to strengthen their study of banking business, and to further improve their theoretical knowledge of banking work, preparing to shoulder the task of future economic construction.

　　冀南银行举行区行经理扩大会
    确定下半年营业方针 
    面向农村为农工业生产服务
    加强货币斗争
    严格管理外汇
    【本报邯郸讯】冀南银行总行在上月中旬召开的第二次扩大区行经理会议上，明确规定下半年银行工作的任务和方针为：面向农村、城市为农工业生产服务，加强外汇管理，进行货币斗争，及银行实行企业化。关于银行最基本的方针即面向农村问题，大家认为：银行既为整个经济建设服务，就应以农村为主，下半年应以大部人力资力放在农村进行四项工作：一、在一般合作社已经有基础的地区，开展信用合作社工作，扶助群众自己的借贷关系，以活泼农村金融，建立银行在农村中的群众基础，使银行业务和群众生产结合起来。二、秋后发放大量贷款，主要用于农业手工业纺织业，次为家庭副业及合作运销事业，以配合明春大生产运动。三、争取今年秋后全部收回旧贷款。四、建立农业仓库，以调剂季节性的物价差额及通货流通量。为适合边区经济建设的需要，银行在不放松现有的工矿业基础上，向工矿运输业大量投资，扶助工矿业的发展。
    因为我们的城市是为农村农工业生产服务。因此银行必须：积极扶助城市手工业、工厂、作坊及合作运输之发展，把贷款主要用在扶助生产上，并着重短期小本放款。城市商业只要合于我们的贸易政策，采取扶助方针。加强对银号的组织指导，推动其改造；在一般小城市中扶助群众性的信用合作银号发展。
    为加强货币斗争应严格管理外汇。一、巩固本位币值，扩大本位币市场。一方面紧缩发行，稳定物价，发展生产，另方面，树立独立自主的物价政策并加强金融市场的管理。二、严格管理外汇，配合工商局管理出入口贸易，争取出入口平衡以至出超。三、展开反假票斗争。要把反假票斗争当成对顽斗争的重要工作之一，造成群众性的反假票运动。
    关于利息政策。因战争期间，生产萎缩、通货膨胀，形成商业利润越来越高，工业利润越来越低的不正常趋势。所以我们的利息政策就应以积极的指导作用来改变这种趋势。具体办法：一、应从整体出发，把大量贷款用在工业生产上，生产发达，币值巩固，物价稳定，经济繁荣，对整个解放区说来是有利的。二、适当的提高利息，使存户增多增加款额。这样，对银行对群众都有利。三、调剂工商业利润，去肥养瘦：第一种是开展信用合作社。组织信用合作社的原则应该是：“统一收股，整体分红，资金独立，业务专营”，另一种是提高商贷利息，以补救对农民贷款的损失。实行银行企业化的目的：一、实行正规的经营管理，提高技术，提高工作效率。二、自力更生以达到减轻人民负担。
    最后戎副主席在总结报告中，向大家阐述明年的大生产运动是农民得到土地后，所进行的第二次革命。没有它，农村经济不能发展，农民不能真正翻身，也不能争取和国民党反动派斗争的胜利。戎副主席最后号召全体银行干部，要做什么像什么，要学习商人们那种和气容易招引群众的好作风，要加强学习银行业务，要进一步提高银行工作的理论知识，准备担负将来的经济建设任务。
