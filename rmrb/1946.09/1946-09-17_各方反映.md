　　Reactions from Various Parties

　　After former US Vice President Wallace delivered his speech, it aroused reactions from various parties. According to a report from Agence France-Presse in Washington on the 13th: Whether Wallace's speech signifies a new shift in US policy towards the Soviet Union, no one has given a definitive answer yet. Truman had talks with former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, who advocates US-Soviet amity and may be sent to Moscow, as well as Wallace himself. Truman said at a press conference on the 12th: "He agreed with the entire speech of Commerce Secretary Wallace" (Reuters report). Truman said that Wallace's speech did not differ from Byrnes' policy (Byrnes' policy, which has been implemented since February this year, is generally referred to by American public opinion as a "tough policy towards the Soviet Union"). According to an Agence France-Presse reporter: This agreement came as a surprise to the State Department and important diplomatic figures. Acting Secretary of State Clayton told reporters on the 13th: "Wallace's speech on foreign policy was not explained to him, and to his knowledge, it was not discussed with anyone else in the State Department. He has not received any guidance or instructions regarding changes in American foreign policy, and to his knowledge, any statements made by Byrnes previously remain the foreign policy of the United States."

　　In Britain, the British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, stated that Wallace's speech calling for Soviet-American understanding inherited the spirit of President Roosevelt. At a time of international tension, Wallace's speech is an extremely important matter. Wallace called for a halt to the military preparations for war and opposed atomic diplomacy.

　　A British Foreign Office spokesperson declared on the 13th: Wallace's speech yesterday did not fail to cause some consternation. According to an Agence France-Presse reporter: "British official sources simultaneously emphasized that Britain has not expressed support for a Soviet-American war. The situation created by Wallace's speech will, in any case, give rise to thorough study. Wallace's speech strengthens a theoretical basis...that Britain should seriously study the possibility of Anglo-Soviet relations." The reporter revealed that the British government had recently received various plans suggesting Anglo-Soviet cooperation in solving the German and Iranian problems, and said: "It is still doubtful whether the US government will rashly engage in these plans, but Wallace's speech naturally increases the chances of their realization."

　　各方反映
    【新华社延安十四日电】前美副总统华莱士发表演说后，引起各方反映。据法国新闻处华府十三日电称：华莱士的演讲，是否意味着美国对苏政策的一个新转变，还没有谁作出肯定的答复。杜鲁门曾与主张美苏亲善的而且可能派往莫斯科的前驻苏大使戴维斯及华莱士本人谈话，在杜鲁门于十二日在记者招待会上说：“他同意商务部长华莱士的全部演说”（路透社电）。杜鲁门说：华氏演讲与贝纳斯政策并无分歧（按贝纳斯自今年二月以来所执行的政策，被美国一般舆论称之为“对苏强硬政策”）。据法国新闻处记者称：这种同意出乎国务院及重要外交人士的意料之外，而代理国务卿克来顿于十三日告记者说：“华莱士外交政策的演讲并未和他解释过，就他所知，亦未与国务院任何其他人商谈过。关于美国外交政策的改变，他未接到任何指导或指示，就他所知，贝纳斯以前所作的任何声明依然是美国的外交政策”。
    在英国，英共机关报工人日报称：华莱士号召苏美谅解的演讲，系承继了罗斯福总统的精神，在这国际局面紧张的时候，华氏的演讲是一件极为重要的事。华莱士号召停止进行战争的武力准备，并反对原子外交的。
    英国外交部发言人于十三日宣称：华莱士昨日之演说，并非未引起某些惊愕。据法新闻处记者称：“英官方人士同时强调英国并未表示过赞成苏美战争之意见，由于华氏演说而产生之形势，无论如何，将会引起彻底之研究。华氏之演说，加强了一种理论根据，这种理论……英国应当严肃地研究英苏关系之可能性。”该记者透露英政府最近曾收到建议英苏合作解决德国及伊朗问题的各种计划，并说：“美政府是否冒然从事这些计划尚属疑问，但华莱士之演说自然增加了其实现的机会。”
