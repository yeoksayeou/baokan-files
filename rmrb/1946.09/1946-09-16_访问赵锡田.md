　　Visiting Zhao Xitian
    Qí Yǔ
    General Zhao Xitian, commander of the Kuomintang's Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army), who laid down his arms on the Heze front, has now arrived in a certain area of the military region. General Zhao is 45 years old and a graduate of the second class of Whampoa Military Academy, having served as an instructor at the academy and as a brigade commander, division commander, and army commander in the Central Army. General Zhao is wearing an American-style yellow-green military uniform and an American-style round-topped hat. Although he has a slight injury to his neck, he is in high spirits. According to the doctor, General Zhao's wound should heal within a week if there are no complications. He is staying in a quiet and comfortable room, with weeping willows outside the window, and a flock of geese playing in a clear pond constantly sending out their loud songs. When the reporter visited, General Zhao was engrossed in reading various newly published books and newspapers from the liberated areas while leaning against the bed. General Zhao smiled when he saw the reporter and said that he had already felt some unexpected impressions since stepping into the liberated areas. He said, "I chatted with the peasants carrying stretchers on the road, and I feel that the general political and cultural level of the people in the liberated areas is different from that in the Kuomintang areas. Almost everyone clearly understands that this war is to oppose civil war. This is the biggest progress in the liberated areas." He saw that the lives of the peasants along the way were much better than in the Kuomintang areas, and he did not see a single piece of wasteland on such a long journey. "I often say that labor is capital, and society will naturally become stronger if we do this." He said that he did not know much about the liberated areas in the past, but now he understands and has personally experienced many things. He believes that he will also make progress by doing so. He said, "When a group makes progress, the people will support it and it will be victorious."
    Speaking of the civil war, General Zhao also said with great pain, "If the civil war continues, it will inevitably drag China into even more darkness and backwardness." He continued with a regretful tone, "It has been more than a year since the Japanese devils surrendered. If there were no civil war, the whole country would have already moved towards peaceful construction, and the people would have already lived a peaceful and prosperous life. Now, who in the country does not oppose it?" Then General Zhao talked to the reporter about his life experience and his hometown. He said, "When I was at the Whampoa Military Academy, I could recommend communist books at will. If the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could have continued until now, China would have definitely been built well. Japan would never have dared to launch a 'September 18th Incident' or a 'July 7th Incident,' and there would be no civil war today, causing a painful situation of endless wars and mutual killings." Speaking of this, he excitedly told the reporter, "My hometown is Lianshui in the liberated areas. I have a student, Li Xuexin, who led thousands of guerrillas in northern Jiangsu during the War of Resistance Against Japan, fighting bloody battles with the enemy, and helped and cared for my family a lot. My nephew, Zhao Zhenshan, works in the New Fourth Army, and there were constant letters back and forth three years ago. If I were still holding weapons in my hands today, I might meet my student and my own nephew on the battlefield one day. If there is such a scene, I will not only be sorry to the country and the nation, but also to my ancestors..." At this time, General Zhao's voice was a little choked, and his sighs were mixed with tears, which were about to burst out of his eyes.
    Finally, General Zhao frankly admitted that although the Third Division had Soviet-aided tanks from the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan in terms of weapons and equipment, and various guns and cannons received from the Japanese army after the victory, as well as American-made artillery and airplanes, the civil war, the attack on the liberated areas, the escape of the people, and the uprisings were caused by popular resentment against the war and the wrong military orders leading to the long-term fatigue of the troops, which led to complaints. The Eighth Route Army, however, was supported by the people, commanded flexibly and mobilely, had a clear understanding of the enemy's situation, had high morale, was brave and tenacious, able to attack and defend, and had strong firepower, which was truly beyond expectations. When the reporter asked if the officers and soldiers of the Third Division who laid down their arms said that Americans personally fired artillery and American advisors commanded the battle, General Zhao only did not deny the fact that there were American advisors in his troops.

　　访问赵锡田
    齐语
    荷泽前线放下武器的蒋军第三师（原第十军）师长赵锡田将军，现已抵达军区某地。赵师长现年四十五岁，黄埔二期毕业后，历任该校教官及中央军旅长师长军长等职。赵师长全身上下穿的是美国式的黄绿色军服，头戴美式圆顶帽子，颈间虽略负轻伤，精神却奕奕焕发，据医生称，赵师长的伤口如无变化，一周内即可告复元。他住在一间恬静而安适的房间里，窗外垂柳成荫，清水池塘游戏着的鹅群不断送来浓浊的歌声。记者往访时赵师长正在聚精会神倚床阅读解放区新出版的各种书报。赵师长见到记者，含笑表示他刚踏进解放区已经感到一些出乎他意外的印象。他说，我在路上同抬担架的老百姓闲谈，我觉得解放区人民的一般政治文化水准比国民党区是不同的，几乎是每个人都清楚的了解这次战争是为了反对内战。这是解放区的最大进步。一路上他所看到的农民生活比国民党区好的多，走了这样远的路，没有看见一块荒地。我常说劳动就是资本，这样作社会自然就会强起来。他自称过去对解放区了解的不多，现在了解了，并且亲身体验了不少的东西，他认为这样做下去他也会进步的。他说：“一个团体进步，民众就会拥护，就会胜利”。
    谈到内战问题，赵师长也是很痛心的说：“内战如果再继续下去，必然要把中国拖进更加黑暗和落后。”他继续用惋惜的语气说：“日寇投降一年多了，假若不是打内战，全国早已走向和平建设，老百姓早已过起安居乐业的和平生活，现在，全国老百姓谁不反对？”接着赵师长又和记者谈起他的身世和家乡来，他说：“我在黄埔学校时可以随便举荐共产主义书籍，那时国共合作倘能继续到现在，中国一定建设好了，日本绝不敢来一个‘九一八’，‘七七事变’，更不会有今天的内战，造成兵连祸结自相残杀的痛心局面。”谈到这里，他很激动的告诉记者说：“我的老家在解放区的涟水，我有一位学生李学新，抗战期间曾在苏北领导游击队数千人与敌人血战，对我的家庭帮助和照顾很大，我的侄子赵振山就在新四军工作，三年前还不断有书信来往。假如今天我的手里还继续拿着武器，说不定有一天我会和我的学生和自己的侄子在战场上相见，如果真有那样场面的话，不仅对不起国家民族，亦将对不起自己的祖宗……”这时赵师长的声音有些哽咽了，他的叹息唏嘘着热泪，几欲夺眶而出。
    最后赵师长很坦白的承认此次作战第三师虽然在武器装备上有抗战开始时苏联援助中国抗战的坦克车，有胜利后接收日本军队的各种枪炮，同时还有美造的大炮飞机，由于打内战，进攻解放区，人民逃避，反抗四起，民心厌战，加以军令指导错误部队久战疲备，怨声载道，而八路军却是人心所向，指挥灵活机动，敌情明了，士气旺盛，勇敢顽强，能攻能守，火力强大，真是出乎意料之外。当记者问到放下武器的第三师官兵都说此次作战有美国人亲自发射大炮并有美国顾问指挥作战的事实时，赵师长仅对其部队中有美国顾问一事不予否认。
