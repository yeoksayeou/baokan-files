Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd. In the Jinpu Railway area of Huainan, which was occupied by Chiang's army, the militia has been active and continuously struck against Chiang's army. On the morning of August 8th, Chiang's army, in coordination with more than 90 "Homecoming Corps" members, advanced in several directions. A unit of the local militia repelled them all. On July 18th, the Xuyi militia, in coordination with the main force, defeated Chiang's advancing army near Zhanghongying (50 li southeast of Xuyi), capturing one cannon, one submachine gun, and one war horse. When Gu Cheng (40 li south of Xuyi, now a Chiang-occupied area that has been recovered by the New Fourth Army) was occupied, Chiang's army sent township chiefs down to the villages three times to establish a government, but they were all driven away by the local militia. The military region has rewarded them with 300 bullets and 10,000 Central China currency.

　　津浦路民兵活跃打击蒋军获奖赏
    【新华社淮阴二日电】被蒋军侵占之淮南津浦路地区，民兵活跃不断予蒋军以打击。八月八日上午，蒋军配合“还乡团”九十余人，分路进犯，该区民兵一部将其全部击退，七月十八日，盱眙民兵配合主力于张洪营（盱眙东南五十里）附近击溃进犯蒋军，缴获炮一门，冲锋机一挺，战马一匹，侵占古城时（盱眙南四十里，现已为新四军收复之蒋军地区），蒋军曾三次派出乡长下乡建立政权，均为当地民兵驱走。军区曾奖励子弹三百发，华中币一万元。
