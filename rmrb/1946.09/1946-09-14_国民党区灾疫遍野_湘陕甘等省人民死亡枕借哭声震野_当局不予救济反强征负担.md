Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 11th: According to the Xi'an Zheng Bao, Hunan is suffering the most severe disaster among the 19 provinces in the country. The people along Dongting Lake are without food or clothing during this time of year between harvests, with countless deaths and rampant epidemics, and no medicine for treatment. It is estimated that more than four million people have died from hunger and disease.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: Following various disasters such as floods, hail, wind, sandstorms, drought, excessive rain, and wheat smut disease, the Yellow River in Gansu Province surged at the beginning of this month. As of the 8th, the water level has reached over 1,500 meters, causing many breaches along the banks. This year, the disaster area in Gansu Province has reached 25 counties, with four million disaster victims in June and July, accounting for 75% of the province's population. Starvation is widespread, yet the province is still required to bear over 860,000 shi of land tax this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: Xi'an News: The number of disaster-stricken counties in Shaanxi has reached 14. Following the summer drought, floods have occurred again in autumn. Counties such as Shenmu, Pingmin, Xianyang, Ba County, Weinan, Ningqiang, Shang County, Guannan, Bin County, Xiong County, Gaoling, Lintong, Huayin, and Fugu have been hit by a combination of waterlogging, drought, wind, and rain, resulting in extremely severe disaster conditions. In Shenmu County, following a severe drought in May, townships such as Minzu, Zhongxiao, Fuxing, Xinyi, Renai, Yunchuan, and Jianguo were hit by rain and floods in June and July. Mountain torrents erupted, turning the fields into rivers with water levels as high as three zhang (approximately 10 meters), unseen in over 30 years. Saplings and crops along the banks were washed away. In Lintong, the water level reached over 40 chi (approximately 13 meters), resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and turning villages into vast expanses of water. In Fugu, after a summer drought, it rained continuously since July and was also hit by hailstorms. Hail accumulated over a chi (approximately 0.3 meters) on the fields and killed people (the son of a Mr. Bai in Baijiapo Village). The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. The summer wheat harvest was already severely reduced due to the drought (only 10% in Shang County, less than 20% in Huayin, and no harvest of summer crops in Fugu). Now, with the addition of the autumn disaster, the autumn harvest has been severely affected. Crops in Shenmu and Fugu have been completely destroyed, and there is no hope for an autumn harvest in Ningqiang and Bin County. Cotton fields in Weinan, Gaoling, and Fugu have also been severely damaged. Cries resound across the fields, and people are flocking to county towns in groups to beg for food and report the disasters. However, the Kuomintang authorities' oppressive policies have only intensified. Although the land tax is ostensibly reduced by half, the actual amount collected is still over 2.2 million shi, with the people bearing six to seven times more taxes and levies than during the war. The Shaanxi Provincial Assembly and the people in various places are calling for the exemption of land tax and the reduction of grain and fodder burdens.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: According to the August 3rd issue of the China Weekly Review, farmers in Pudong, across the river from Shanghai, are unwilling to cultivate the land because it costs each farmer 100,800 yuan for labor and wages, and 22,000 yuan for fertilizer, totaling 130,000 yuan per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares). The harvest is only two and a half dan (approximately 125 kg) of rice, which can be milled into two dan of clean rice. At the current market price, this can be sold for 120,000 or 130,000 yuan, just enough to cover the costs. However, each mu must pay 5.4 dou (approximately 54 liters) of land tax, leaving only 1.46 dan of rice, worth only 87,600 or 95,000 yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 10th: According to the September 1st Tianjin Dagong Bao, the Liao River in the Northeast has flooded, leaving 200,000 refugees in need of assistance. Continuous autumn rains in western Liaoning in late August caused the disaster, submerging farmland in Xinmin and Panshan, turning it into a watery expanse.

　　国民党区灾疫遍野
    湘陕甘等省人民死亡枕借哭声震野 
    当局不予救济反强征负担
    【新华社延安十一日电】据西安正报讯：湘灾惨重，为全国十九省中之冠。洞庭湖滨人民在此青黄不接之际，无衣无食，死者累累，瘟疫横行，无药医治，估计死于饥疫者，在四百万人以上。
    【新华社延安十日电】甘肃继水、雹、风、沙、干旱、雨潦、黑穗病等各种灾害之后，本月初黄河暴涨，迄八日止，水位已达一千五百公尺以上，沿岸被冲毁多处。按甘省今年灾荒已达二十五县，灾民在六、七月间已达四百万，占全省人口百分之七十五，饥殍遍野，今年仍要负担八十六万余石田赋。
    【新华社延安十日电】西安讯：陕报灾县份已达十四县，继夏季旱灾之后，入秋又起水灾，神木、平民、咸阳、坝县、渭南、宁强、商县、关南、彬县、雄县、高陵、临潼、华阴、府谷等十四县，水旱风雨交至，灾情至为严重。神木县继五月大旱以后，其民族、忠孝、复兴、信义、仁爱、云川、建国等乡镇，先后于六七月间惨遭雨灾与水灾，山洪暴发，遍野成河，水位高达三丈，为三十余年所未有，沿岸树苗田禾冲洗一空。临潼水位高达四十余尺，死者数万，庄园一片汪洋。府谷夏旱以后，七月以来降雨竟月，并遭冰雹，田禾积雹尺余，并击死人口（白家坡村白某之子），灾情之重，是闻所未闻。夏麦在旱灾中已严重歉收（按商县仅及一成，华阴不到二成，府谷夏禾豆麦则已毫无收成），今又加上秋灾，秋收大受打击。神木、府谷禾苗俱毁，宁强、彬县秋收已无希望。渭南、高陵及府谷的棉田亦均遭重灾，各地哭声震野，人民成群结队奔赴县城乞食报灾。但国民党当局的苛政，反而日重，田赋虽表面上说是免征半数，但实际征收数目仍在二百数十万石以上，人民担负了较战时增至六七倍的税收摊派。现陕西参议会及各地人民纷纷呼吁免征田赋及减轻粮秣等负担。
    【新华社延安十日电】据八月三日密勒氏评论报载：在上海对岸之浦东农民，已不愿耕种土地，因为每一个农民耕种土地一亩，须花费劳力工资十万零八千元，肥料二万二千元，共计十三万元，收获仅谷二担半，碾成净米二担，依目前市价能卖十二万元或十三万元，仅够老本。但每亩须缴田赋五四斗所剩米一·四六担，仅折洋八万七千六或九万五千元。
    【新华社延安十日电】九月一日天津大公报载：东北辽河泛滥，待救难民达二十万。缘八月下旬辽西秋雨绵绵，以致成灾，新民、盘山农田淹没，尽成泽国。
