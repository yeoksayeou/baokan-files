[Report from Our Newspaper in Heze, 28th] The masses in Heze's Yongshui District had just been liberated and given land to cultivate when they suddenly heard that Old Chiang was attacking the liberated areas. Everyone was furious because they all knew that Old Chiang wanted to destroy their happy lives. To defend their own happy lives, they all bravely participated in the logistical work of the war. At a mass meeting in Pipali, eighty strong young men eagerly signed up to carry stretchers. Within two days, stretcher teams and transport teams throughout the district were organized, with 120 stretchers and 80 carts setting off together.

When news of the victory on the 14th arrived, the masses joyfully saw off the village militiamen with gongs and drums. In some villages, farmers' associations even offered the militiamen cigarettes, wine, and flowers. The militiamen all said, "Anyone who doesn't do a good job will be letting down the country, letting down everyone, and letting down themselves."

With most of the young and strong men participating in the war, mutual aid teams for the autumn harvest were quickly organized, and men, women, old, and young all went to the fields. They knew that to guarantee victory in the battle, they had to harvest the crops on time. Some villages temporarily organized all their labor into mutual aid harvest teams, divided into many groups, such as farmers' association groups, gun groups, elderly groups, children's groups, and women's groups. The main task now is to cut sorghum, with the men cutting in front and the women clipping behind; the men pull it back to the threshing ground, and the children inspect and weed. Some villages help the families of militiamen participating in the war to harvest according to the militia roster. Some villages help each other by surname, some groups help other groups, and one alley helps another alley, with someone appointed to mobilize and assign tasks. Priority is given to military families and the families of militiamen participating in the war.

In short, they combined production and war, and completed the war mobilization work with great effort.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Heze, 26th] The Jiluyu Administrative Office, in view of the selfless and arduous efforts of the participating militiamen and stretcher-bearers in the front lines during the recent Longhai Campaign, specifically instructed the special, county, and municipal governments to implement the compensation for the wounded and killed participating militiamen and the compensation for the losses of the masses. The original order is as follows: In this patriotic self-defense war, those militiamen and stretcher-bearers who are wounded or killed in combat or en route should be given immediate compensation. Leading cadres at all levels must personally visit their homes to express condolences and hold memorial services to show praise. In addition to providing treatment for the wounded (medical expenses will be reimbursed by the government), it is also necessary to call on the masses to provide comfort and condolences. The families of those who are killed or disabled will be treated as military dependents (local army) with preferential treatment. Livestock and vehicles dispatched to support the front lines that are damaged or killed due to the war will be promptly compensated by the government based on local market prices (in principle, the masses should not suffer losses), without delay. The government should also seize the opportunity to commend stretcher teams, road repair teams, and individuals who actively participate in war support work, and educate those who are not active.

　　荷泽人民保卫翻身好时光
    永绥区青壮参战不误秋收
    冀鲁豫行署训令抚偿参战受损民兵群众
    【本报荷泽廿八日电】荷泽永绥区群众刚翻了身，有了地种，忽然听说老蒋进攻解放区，人人气愤，因为人人知道老蒋要毁灭他们幸福的生活。为了保卫他们自己的幸福生活，他们都奋勇的参加战争中的后勤工作。琵琶里群众大会上，八十名壮丁争先报名抬担架。两天内全区的担架队运输队都组织起来了，一百二十付担架，八十辆大车一齐出发。
    十四号胜利消息传来，各村民兵出发时，群众都锣鼓喧天的欢送。有的村庄农会还给民兵敬烟敬酒献花，民兵都说：“谁不好好干，对不起国家，对不起大家，对不起自家。”
    青壮年多数参战了，秋收互助组马上组织起来，男女老少齐下地。他们知道要保证战斗胜利，就按时收割庄稼。有的是全村劳动力临时组织起来，互助收割，分成很多班，如农会班，枪班，老年班，儿童班和妇女班。现在主要是砍高粱，男的前边砍，女的随后剪；男的拉回场里，儿童检查和锄草。有的村按自卫队名单帮助参战民兵家收割。有的村一姓帮一姓，一伙帮一伙，一个胡同帮一个胡同，推出一个人来动员分派。并且先照顾军属与参战民兵。
    总之，他们使生产与战争结合，且用大力完成了战争动员工作。
    【本报荷泽二十六日讯】冀鲁豫行署以此次陇海战役中参战民兵与担架民众在前线奋不顾身，异常艰苦，特训令各专、县、市政府执行参战民兵民众抚恤与民众损失赔偿，原令如下：这次爱国自卫战争，参战民兵与担架民众，在战斗及行途中负伤与死亡者，应即予以抚恤，各级政府主要负责干部并须亲到他们家中进行慰问，同时召开追悼会，以示表扬，除伤者予以治疗外（药费由政府报销），还应号召群众予以慰劳慰问。牺牲与残废者其家属均按军属（地方军）优待。为支援前线出差服役之牲畜、车辆，因战争损毁或死亡者，由政府根据当地市价（原则上不让群众吃亏）迅速赔偿，不得延误。政府并应抓紧表扬积极参加战勤工作的担架队，破路队及个人，对不积极者应进行教育。
