Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, September 25th: Wallace stated: The speeches of Stalin and Eden have brought hope to millions of peace-loving people around the world. Wallace believes that the debate "culminating in his resignation had a positive effect, because it was only after the disagreement between him and the US government that Stalin expressed his views." Wallace concluded: Eden claimed that relations with the Soviet Union might need to be handled from a new perspective; on the other hand, Stalin believes that the capitalist and communist systems can easily work side by side.

　　华莱士称：斯大林和艾登的讲话给和平人类带来希望
    【新华社延安二十五日电】法国新闻处华盛顿二十四日电：华莱士称：斯大林和艾登的讲话，给全世界千百万爱好和平人类带来了希望。华氏认为以他的辞职“为顶点的争辩有积极作用，因为正是当着他和美国政府分歧之后，斯大林才表示了他的意见”。华氏结语称：艾登声称和苏联的关系也许应该由新的角度来处理；另一方面，斯大林则认为资本主义与共产主义制度，可以容易地在一起并肩工作。
