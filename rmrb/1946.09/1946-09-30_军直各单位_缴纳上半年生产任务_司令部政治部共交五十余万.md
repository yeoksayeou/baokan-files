　　Military Direct Units
　　Hand in First Half-Year Production Quotas
　　Headquarters and Political Department Contribute Over 500,000

    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 26th] The border region's soldiers, while persisting in production amidst frequent and intense fighting, have achieved outstanding results. The military direct units have been handing in their first half-year production quotas in succession these past few days. At present, the Headquarters has handed in 301,280 yuan, and the Political Department has handed in 251,720 yuan, both exceeding their assigned quotas. It is reported that the military region has recently stipulated that all production quotas for the second half-year will be transferred to public miscellaneous expenses, and the rear units and organs have also resolved one month's worth of vegetable funds. The military direct organs are now actively engaged in production to complete this task ahead of schedule.
