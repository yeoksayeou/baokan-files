    The People's Army Newspaper of Vietnam Discusses the Valuable Experience of the People's War in South Vietnam
    As Long As You Dare to Fight, There Are Good Ways to Defeat the American Devils!
    The deeper the hatred, the greater the determination. Everyone fights, everywhere they fight, using all weapons to fight. Every season is a season of disaster for the invaders, and everywhere is a graveyard for the American robbers.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th) The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army* published a commentary on the 16th entitled "The Valuable Experiences of the 'American-Annihilating Heroes'," summarizing the rich experience of the South Vietnamese army and people in fighting the US military during the dry season.
    The commentary stated that the South Vietnamese army and people, by promoting the spirit of revolutionary heroism, daring to fight, and being good at fighting, have shattered the myth of so-called American military "power."
    The commentary said that at the end of the rainy season last year, when Johnson suddenly poured tens of thousands of American troops and tens of thousands of tons of steel into South Vietnam, the US-puppet clique became complacent and thought they could make a big splash. The Washington leadership placed all its hopes on the myth of the "power" of the American army and touted it vigorously. However, the South Vietnamese army and people inflicted fatal blows on the American invading army during the dry season. They annihilated 43,000 American invaders, completely wiped out 14 infantry battalions, 7 armored battalions, and 22 infantry companies, turning more than 1,400 American aircraft and 1,300 American military vehicles of various types into scrap metal. The commentary said that in the dry season battles, thousands of "American-Annihilating Heroes" and hundreds of "Heroic American-Annihilating" units emerged. With outstanding revolutionary heroism and high intelligence, they created many valuable experiences:
    Everyone fights the American devils.
    The brutal American invading army wantonly slaughtered the people, and every South Vietnamese person retaliated without mercy. The deeper the hatred, the higher the determination to annihilate the Americans. The main forces fight, the local forces fight, and the guerrillas also fight. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone fights the American devils. Duan Wenlian, a thirteen-year-old "American-Annihilating Hero," annihilated 14 American soldiers. Wu Ji, a fifty-seven-year-old hero, also killed four American soldiers and shot down a helicopter with a few rifle bullets.
    One person fights, one group fights; small units fight, large units fight. Of course, more people can annihilate a large number of American troops, but fewer people can also annihilate many American troops. One person can annihilate dozens of American troops, and one group can annihilate hundreds of American troops. This has become a very obvious fact in the South.
    If you have the courage to fight the American devils, you can use whatever weapons you have to fight.
    Those with guns use guns, those with knives use knives, and those without them make their own or seize enemy weapons to eliminate the enemy, even using tricks to capture the enemy empty-handed. New weapons can of course effectively annihilate the American army, while simple weapons such as spears, bamboo spikes, traps, and bows and arrows can also effectively annihilate the American army. A single stake array can make hundreds of American soldiers suffer.
    You can fight the American devils anywhere.
    When the American bandits entered South Vietnam, they fell into the fire net of the people's war. Wherever the American devils are stationed, they are fought there; wherever the American devils go, they are fought there. On the streets, in the villages, in the fields, and in the mountains and forests, any place can become a graveyard for burying American robbers.
    Whether it is day or night, rain or shine, any time is the time of death for the American army.
    Every season is a season of disaster for the American army. The American army marches during the day, and the target is clear and easy to hit. They are stationed at night, and are in a state of panic, desperately squeezing together. The more they squeeze together, the more they can be annihilated.
    With the determination to annihilate the Americans, you can create opportunities to annihilate the Americans at any time.
    When the American bandits are cowering in their bases or camping in the field, no matter how they strengthen their defenses, there are still many loopholes that can be severely attacked. When the US military launches "sweeps" from strongholds, there are even more favorable opportunities to annihilate them.
    As long as you dare to strike the American devils, there will be good ways to strike them.
    Whether in the front or behind enemy lines, in the mountains or plains, in the countryside or cities, everyone can choose different methods of fighting that are suitable for their own conditions and environment. The American bandits are not only at a loss and passive because they are besieged on all sides, but also panicked and passive by the ever-changing methods of the "American-Annihilating Heroes" and the different methods of fighting by the military and civilians in various places.
    The South Vietnamese army and people not only use guns to strike the enemy, but also strike the enemy through political struggle and work to disintegrate the enemy army.
    The commentary said that the above experiences were created by the collective wisdom of the South Vietnamese army and people. With these valuable experiences, the South Vietnamese army and people have the power to defeat the American invading army of all services. They fight American infantry when they encounter it, they fight tanks when they encounter them, and they even fight airplanes and warships, and are able to defeat them. The courage and ingenuity of the South Vietnamese army and people, coupled with simple weapons, can completely defeat the American invading army equipped with a large number of modern weapons. These rich experiences of the South Vietnamese army and people are extremely rich living experiences of the highly developed people's war in the South, and are also the secret to the brilliant victories of the South Vietnamese army and people.

    越南《人民军队报》谈南越人民战争的宝贵经验
    只要敢于打，就有好办法打败美国佬
    仇恨愈深，决心愈大。人人打，处处打，用一切武器打。每个季节都是侵略者的灾难季节，什么地方都是美国强盗的坟场。
    据新华社河内十七日电　越南《人民军队报》十六日发表题为《“歼美勇士”们的宝贵经验》的评论，总结了越南南方军民在旱季战斗中打击美军的丰富经验。
    评论说，越南南方军民发扬革命英雄主义精神，敢于战斗，善于战斗，已经粉碎了所谓美国军事“威力”的神话。
    评论说，去年雨季末期，当约翰逊一下子向越南南方投入成十万美军和成十万吨钢铁的时候，美伪集团得意忘形，满以为可以大干一场了。华盛顿的首脑集团把全部希望寄托在美国军队的“威力”的神话上，并且给它大肆吹嘘。但是，南方军民在旱季战斗中给了美国侵略军以致命的打击。歼灭美国侵略军四万三千名，全歼十四个步兵营、七个装甲营和二十二个步兵连，把一千四百多架美国飞机和一千三百多辆美国各种类型军车变成废铁。评论说，在旱季战斗中，出现了数以千计的“歼美勇士”和数以百计的“英勇歼美”单位。他们以卓绝的革命英雄主义和高度的智慧，创造出了许多宝贵的经验：
    人人都打美国佬。
    残暴的美国侵略军肆意残杀人民，越南南方人民每个人也就毫不留情地给予反击。仇恨愈深，歼美决心就愈高。主力部队打，地方部队打，游击队也打。无论男女老幼，人人都打美国佬。十三岁的“歼美勇士”段文练歼灭美军十四名。五十七岁的老勇士武骥，也以几发步枪子弹打死美军四名，打落直升飞机一架。
    一个人打，一个组也打；小的单位打，大的单位也打。人多当然可以大量歼灭美军，但人少也可以歼灭很多美军。一个人可以歼灭数以十计的美军，一个组可以歼灭数以百计的美军，这在南方已经成为非常明显的事实。
    有打美国佬的胆量，就能有什么武器就用什么来打。
    有枪的人用枪，有刀的人用刀，没有的就自己制造或者夺取敌人的武器来消灭敌人，甚至用计谋空手擒敌。新式武器当然可以有效地歼灭美军，而长矛、竹尖、陷阱、弓箭等简陋武器，也可以很好地歼灭美军，一个尖桩阵可以使数以百计的美军吃尽苦头。
    不管什么地方都可以打美国佬。
    美国强盗进入越南南方就陷入了人民战争的火网中。美国佬驻扎在什么地方，就在什么地方打；美国佬走到那里，就打它到那里。在街道上、村庄里、田野间和山林里，什么地方都可以成为埋葬美国强盗的坟场。
    无论是白天还是夜晚，雨天还是晴天，不管什么时间都是美军死亡的时间。
    每一个季节都是美军的灾难季节。美军白天行军，目标清楚，容易打中。夜晚驻扎，精神惶惶，拼命挤在一块，越挤在一块，就能歼灭得越多。
    有了歼美的决心，就什么时候都可以创造出歼美的战机。
    当美国强盗龟缩在基地里或在野营的时候，不管他们怎样加强防卫，仍然存在着许多漏洞，可以予以沉重打击。当美军从据点出动进行“扫荡”时，歼美的有利机会就会更多。
    只要敢于打击美国佬，就会有好办法来打击它。
    在前线或敌后，山区或平原，农村或城市，每个人都可以选择适合于自己条件和环境的不同打法。美国强盗不仅因为四面受敌而不知所措和被动，而且为“歼美勇士”们千变万化的打法、各地军民不同的打法而惊慌失措和被动。
    南方军民不仅用枪杆来打击敌人，而且还通过政治斗争和瓦解敌军工作来打击敌人。
    评论说，上述的这些经验是南方军民以集体的智慧创造出来的。有了这些宝贵的经验，南方军民就有力量战胜各兵种的美国侵略军。他们碰到美国步兵打，碰到坦克也打，连飞机、军舰也打，并且能够把它们打败。南方军民的勇敢和机智的精神，加上简陋武器完全可以打败配备大量现代化武器的美国侵略军队。南方军民的这些丰富经验是南方人民战争高度发展的极其丰富的活经验，也是南方军民取得辉煌胜利的秘诀。
