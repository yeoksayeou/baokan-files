    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th—Kenzo Matsumura, advisor to Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, published an article in the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* on the 6th, stating that Japan-China relations must be improved fundamentally in a broad range.
    The article said: "Needless to say, given the historical, geographical, and cultural relationship, improving Japan-China relations is the (demand of) public opinion. Moreover, great changes are taking place in China. Considering the current international situation, Japan-China relations should not remain at the current level. Judging from the basic attitude of the government and the Liberal Democratic Party toward China, understanding of this fact is insufficient. As the saying goes, 'burying one's head in the sand.' I may be rude to use this analogy, but the current policy toward China is somewhat similar to this." The article pointed out that China is no longer the China of the past. "A new China has emerged next door to Japan. It is not acceptable not to fully recognize this fact. Understanding and recognition of China should first become the prerequisite for improving Japan-China relations. I hope to study China and the China problem with a new feeling."
    The article said: "In this sense, it is very important for people from the Liberal Democratic Party to visit China one after another, see the reality of China with their own eyes, and frankly exchange opinions. Like the Socialist Party and the Communists, it is meaningless to express an attitude of 'what you say is reasonable' regardless of (the Chinese side's opinions). (I am not scolding anyone by saying this.) Good is good, bad is bad, and you must have your own opinions to conduct talks, and find the path that Japan should take from them, otherwise you will miss (Japan's) major opportunities. There are also many contradictions in China's approach, and we should actually observe and analyze them, and consider what we should do for world peace." The article said: "(Japan and China) have a common culture and ethnicity, so there is no obstacle to personnel exchanges. However, it should be remembered that in words and deeds, one should avoid causing (the other side's) misunderstandings. There are misunderstandings and errors on the Chinese side, and there are also cases where the Japanese side deliberately provokes the other side." "Before my departure for China, many major (Japanese) newspaper companies published editorials encouraging an old scholar like me who is not in power, precisely because (the Japanese) people believe that 'Japan-China relations cannot continue like this, and we hope to make efforts to ease the current tense situation.'" "Through this visit to China, I felt that improving Japan-China relations through the so-called accumulation method has reached its limit. That is to say, the time is approaching to resolutely decide to adjust diplomatic relations."
    The article pointed out that there is still much room for development in Japan's trade with China, and demanded that the Sato government change its policy of adhering to the "Yoshida Letter," which hinders the development of Japan-China trade.
    When discussing China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, the article said, "The way to obstruct China from joining the United Nations on important matters will probably not work in the next one or two UN General Assemblies. If (Japan) acts jointly with the United States and the vote fails, it will be equivalent to Japan dying together with the United States. Here, there is indeed a risk of tragedy. Before it develops to this point, Japan should have countermeasures to take." Matsumura Kenzo also advocated in the article that Japan and China must also conclude aviation agreements and conduct technological exchanges.
    According to a Kyodo News report on the 6th, Matsumura met with Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Takeo Miki on the 6th and asked Japanese Prime Minister Sato to change his policy toward China. He criticized Sato and others for putting pressure on Diet members such as Zentaro Kosaka and Masumi Esaki who were planning to visit China. He said, "As long as such pressure is exerted, there will be no improvement in Japan-China relations."
    On the afternoon of the 6th, Matsumura also delivered a speech at the "Matsumura Return Report Meeting" held in Tokyo by the Takasaki office, and reiterated his view: "China is continuing to greatly change its appearance. Without looking at it with a high degree of political vision, you will not understand it. In this sense, it is currently most important for Diet members to visit China with a research attitude, so that Japan's policy toward China does not make mistakes."
    According to reports, when Matsumura Kenzo returned to Japan from China on May 24, he said at Haneda Airport that the issue of extending Japan-China comprehensive trade had been resolved, but "whether Japan-China trade can be developed on the basis of this negotiation depends on the future policies of the Japanese government."

### 松村谦三不满佐藤政府的对华政策  要求从根本上改善日中关系

    松村谦三不满佐藤政府的对华政策
    要求从根本上改善日中关系
    新华社东京七日电　日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三六日在《日本经济新闻》发表文章指出，必须在广泛范围内、从根本上改善日中关系。
    文章说：“用不着说历史的、地理的和文化的关系，改善日中关系是舆论（的要求）。况且中国正在发生大的变化。从目前的国际形势考虑，不应当使日中关系停留在现在的水平上。从政府和自由民主党对待中国的基本态度来看，对这个事实的理解是不够的。俗话说‘掩耳盗铃’。我这样打比喻也许是失礼的，但现在对待中国的政策就有点近似这种情况。”文章指出，中国已经不是过去的中国了。“一个新的中国已经在日本的近邻出现。对这个事实，不予以充分地认识是不行的。对中国的理解和认识，首先应当成为改善日中关系的前提。希望以新的感觉来研究中国和中国问题。”
    文章说：“在这个意义上，自由民主党的人应当接连不断地访问中国，亲眼看看中国的实际，并坦率地交换意见，这是非常重要的。象社会党和共产党人那样，对于（中国方面的意见）不管是什么意见都表示‘言之有理’的态度，也是没有意义的。（我这样讲并不是骂人）好就是好，坏就是坏，要以自己的见解来进行会谈，并从中发现日本应走的道路，否则就会贻误（日本的）大事。中国的做法也是有许多矛盾的，应当实际地进行观察分析，并考虑为世界和平应该作些什么。”文章说：“（日中两国）存在着同文同种的关系，因此人员的来往是没有障碍的。但是，应当记住，在言行方面要避免引起（对方的）误解。中国方面也有误解和错误，日本方面也有故意刺激对方的情况。”“在我访问中国启程之前，（日本）许多大报社发表社论对我这样一个并非当权者的老书生，给以鼓励，也正是因为（日本）国民认为，‘日中关系就这样下去是不行的，希望努力缓和目前的这种紧张局面’”。“通过这次访问中国，我感到靠所谓积累方式来改善日中关系已经到了限度。这就是说，果断地下决心调整邦交的时机已经临近。”
    文章指出日本同中国的贸易还有很多发展的余地，并且要求佐藤政府改变坚持阻碍日中贸易发展的“吉田书简”的政策。
    文章在谈到中国在联合国的合法权利时说，“阻挠中国加入联合国的重要事项方式，恐怕在最近一、两次联合国大会上就行不通了。如果（日本）同美国共同行动，投票失败了，那就等于日本跟美国一起情死。这里，确实有出现悲剧之虞。在发展到这一步之前，日本理应有应当采取的对策。”松村谦三在文章中还主张日中两国还必须缔结航空协定和进行技术交流等。
    据共同社六日报道，松村在六日会见日本通商产业大臣三木武夫时，要求日本首相佐藤改变对中国政策。他批评佐藤等人正对计划访问中国的小坂善太郎、江崎真澄等议员施加压力。他说，“只要是采取这样的压力，日中关系就不会有任何改善。”
    松村六日下午还在东京由高崎办事处举行的“松村回国报告会”上发表演说，再次强调了这样的看法：“中国正在继续大大地改变面貌，对这一点，不用高度的政治眼光去看，就不会了解。在这个意义上，国会议员要以研究的态度参观中国，以便使日本对中国政策不发生错误，这是目前最重要的事情。”
    据报道，松村谦三五月二十四日从中国回到日本时曾在羽田机场发表谈话说，关于日中综合贸易的延长问题已经获得解决，但是，“能否在这次谈判的基础上发展日中贸易，取决于日本政府今后的方针”。
