    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 20th. Recently, Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, held a worker-peasant-soldier concert singing the praises of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. More than 3,000 workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, young students, and children took to the stage, demonstrating the powerful strength of the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With deep class feelings, they sincerely praised the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and sang the praises of Mao Zedong Thought; filled with high fighting spirit, they sang the battle hymn of the Cultural Revolution and opened fire on the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs. The broad masses of the audience said: This is a concert singing the praises of the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a concert singing the praises of the proletarian revolution, and a concert sweeping away the anti-Party, anti-socialist demons and monsters.
    The concert began with the chorus of "The East is Red." The Baoji area railway worker chorus sang "Great Nation, Great Party" and "Long Live the Communist Party, Long Live Chairman Mao" with full emotion and sincere feeling. The New Qin Textile Factory's performance of "Chairman Mao's Works are Like the Sun" vividly reflected the textile workers' respect and belief in Chairman Mao. The farmer singing team from the Jinling Brigade of the Changshou Commune, composed of more than 100 poor and lower-middle peasants, many of whom are activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, Five-Good League members and Five-Good Youths, performed three songs including "Our Generation," singing out the revolutionary pride of the younger generation growing up healthily under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought. The Baoji City Public Security Brigade soldiers' performance of "Chairman Mao's Soldiers Listen to the Party the Most" simply reflected the soldiers' infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and revolutionary optimism.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers regarded participating in the concert as a battle action in the socialist cultural revolution. With strong class feelings, they regarded each song as a bullet fired at the anti-Party black gang. The songs they sang, such as "Open Fire on the Black Line," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and "We Will Never Withdraw Our Troops Without Complete Victory," all embodied their deep-seated hatred for the class enemy and their determination to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Each song was full of a strong fighting passion for criticizing the old world and building a new world. The chorus members of the Jinling Brigade of the Changshou Commune, who were busy with the summer harvest, put down their sickles and rushed to participate in the concert. Commune member Luo Qun said: "We are here to sing, and we are also here to fight. We must regard every song as a bullet and open fire on the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line. They slander Chairman Mao, so we will sing the praises of Chairman Mao." Activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, Fu Jinchang, said: "We must use songs to fiercely open fire on the bourgeois 'authorities' and expose the reactionary faces of those demons and monsters. They want to perform 'emperors, generals, ministers, and prime ministers,' and 'talented scholars and beautiful ladies,' but we insist on performing workers, peasants, and soldiers, performing Wang Jinxi, and singing the praises of Dazhai people. Workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy the revolutionary ideological and cultural front."
    This concert fully demonstrated the literary and artistic talent of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in creation and performance. The small song and dance "Construction Workers' Hearts are with the Party" performed by the amateur performance team of the No. 2 Company of the Fifth Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering was praised by the broad masses of the audience. The program was created by more than 20 workers holding axes and trowels. They performed themselves, sang themselves, with sincere and vivid feelings. In order to create this program, worker Zhu Zhiming and others repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and confidently picked up their pens, wrote and performed themselves. The workers said: "After studying Chairman Mao's works, our hearts are bright, and our fighting spirit is firm. We are not afraid of heavy burdens on our shoulders, and we are not afraid of demons and monsters calling themselves evil... With utter devotion, we will engage in revolution, and hold high the red flag to advance forever!"
    The concert had more than 70 programs and lasted for four hours. From beginning to end, it was full of a warm fighting atmosphere.

    歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利
    高唱无产阶级文化大革命的战歌
    宝鸡工农兵音乐会向反党反社会主义黑线开火
    新华社西安二十日电  陕西省宝鸡市最近举行了工农兵歌唱无产阶级文化大革命音乐会。三千多名工人、农民、解放军战士、青年学生和少年儿童，登台表演，显示了无产阶级文化大革命主力军的强大威力。他们带着深厚的阶级感情，衷心地歌颂党中央和毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想；他们充满着高昂的斗志，大唱文化大革命的战歌，向反党反社会主义黑帮开火。广大观众说：这是一次歌颂毛泽东思想新胜利的音乐会，是歌颂无产阶级革命的音乐会，是横扫反党反社会主义牛鬼蛇神的音乐会。
    音乐会在全体齐唱《东方红》的歌声中开始。宝鸡地区铁路职工合唱团演唱的《伟大的国家伟大的党》《万岁共产党，万岁毛主席》，情绪饱满，感情真挚。新秦纺织厂演出的《毛主席著作象太阳》表演唱，生动地反映了纺织工人对毛主席的崇敬和信仰。由一百多名贫下中农青年组成的长寿公社金陵大队的农民演唱队，其中许多是学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好团员和五好青年，他们表演了《我们这一代》等三首歌曲，唱出了青年一代，在毛泽东思想哺育下健康成长的革命豪情。宝鸡市公安大队战士演出的《毛主席的战士最听党的话》，朴实地反映了战士对毛主席的无限忠诚和革命的乐观精神。
    广大工农兵群众把参加音乐会当做是参加社会主义文化大革命的战斗行动。他们怀着强烈的阶级感情，把每首歌当做射向反党黑帮的一颗子弹。他们演唱的《向黑线开火》、《将革命进行到底》、《不获全胜，决不收兵》等歌曲，都体现了他们对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨和将社会主义革命进行到底的决心，每一首歌都充满着批判旧世界、建设新世界的强烈的战斗激情。正在紧张夏收的长寿公社金陵大队的合唱队员，放下了镰刀，赶来参加音乐会。社员罗群说：“我们是来唱歌的，我们也是来战斗的，要把每一首歌子当做子弹，向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，他们诬蔑毛主席，我们就歌唱毛主席。”学习毛主席著作积极分子傅金昌说：“我们要用歌声向资产阶级‘权威’猛烈开火，揭露那些牛鬼蛇神的反动嘴脸。他们要演‘帝王将相’、‘才子佳人’，我们就偏要演工农兵，演王进喜，唱大寨人。工农兵一定要占领革命的思想文化阵地。”
    在这次音乐会上，充分表现了工农兵在创作和表演方面的文艺天才。建筑工程部五局二公司业余演出队演出的小歌舞《建筑工人心向党》，受到了广大观众的赞赏。创作这个节目的就是手提斧子、泥刀的二十多个工人。他们演自己，唱自己，感情真挚，活灵活现。为了创作出这个节目，工人朱志明等反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，信心百倍地拿起了笔，自己编，自己演。工人们说：“学习了毛主席著作，心明眼亮斗志坚，怕什么重担压双肩，怕什么牛鬼蛇神称恶顽……赤胆忠心干革命，高举红旗永向前！”
    音乐会七十多个节目，持续了四个小时。从始到终充满着热烈战斗的气氛。
