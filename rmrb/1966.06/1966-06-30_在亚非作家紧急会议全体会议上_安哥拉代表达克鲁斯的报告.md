	The people of the whole world unite, defeat the American aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will certainly be the people's. All the devils will be annihilated.

	At the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers

	Report by Angolan Representative Viriato da Cruz

	New China News Agency, June 29th

	The Angolan representative Viriato da Cruz said at the plenary meeting of the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers today that Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. African and Asian writers, through serious study of Mao Zedong Thought, can grasp a weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb. This weapon can thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate imperialism and revisionism.

	Da Cruz also pointed out that the aggressive nature of imperialism led by the United States has not changed in the slightest, and Soviet modern revisionism advocates that the oppressed peoples should "peacefully coexist" with imperialism, proving that it is the biggest accomplice of imperialism.

	He emphasized that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism. To think that imperialism can be defeated without opposing revisionism is a serious illusion.

	Da Cruz said, just as Mao Zedong said, "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear-cut." To uphold and spread the truth, we Asian and African writers should expose, condemn, and oppose modern revisionism. If we do not resolutely carry the struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet Union to the end, then in any place, imperialism cannot be truly defeated.

	In his report, Da Cruz strongly condemned the fact that while imperialism is carrying out bloody suppression, it is shamelessly conducting cultural aggression in Africa and Asia. He said, Asian and African writers bear a great historical responsibility that cannot be shirked, which is to awaken, mobilize, and organize the masses of the people, and to carry the struggle against imperialism to the end without compromise.

	He said, imperialism will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Imperialism never gives up violence. By its nature, it will only use violence. The result is that imperialism makes us understand that armed struggle is the main form of the people's anti-imperialist struggle.

	Da Cruz said, to oppose imperialism, we must remove the stumbling blocks in the people's path, which are the revisionist fallacies of "peaceful transition," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful coexistence." We must also oppose modern revisionist literature because modern revisionist literature is only a new variant of imperialist ideology, a reflection of modern revisionist policy in the realm of ideology. It pretends to be anti-imperialist but actually serves the enemy, truly colluding with imperialism.

	Da Cruz condemned the collusion between Soviet modern revisionists and American imperialism, deceiving and betraying the revolutionary people of the world. He said, Soviet modern revisionists claim that U.S.-Soviet cooperation can solve all world problems. But can the people of Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, South Africa, and Zimbabwe achieve liberation through U.S.-Soviet cooperation? Can U.S.-Soviet cooperation make the independent countries of Asia and Africa consolidate their independence and truly achieve economic liberation? Although we find this laughable, the fact is that Soviet revisionists have made these absurdities their political line. U.S.-Soviet cooperation is an obvious and undeniable sign of the betrayal of the sacred interests of the Asian and African peoples and the peoples of the whole world by revisionism.

	Da Cruz said, modern revisionists have adopted extremely cunning policies. They constantly wave the banners of Marxism-Leninism and national democratic revolution, but this is only to further betray. They have played a role that no other pro-imperialist forces can play for imperialism. Revisionists in Africa have deceived many people, and they have played the same role for American imperialism in Africa as they are currently playing in Vietnam. If we tear off their masks of pretending to be friends and benefactors of Africa, we will see that their policy in Africa is essentially: sometimes they intervene to make deals behind the backs of the African people to serve imperialism and then withdraw; sometimes they intervene as deeply as possible to bring a certain African country into the orbit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. This is what they have done to the liberation movements of the people of Angola, Mozambique, and Portuguese Guinea.

	He pointed out that all this shows that we must closely link the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism with the struggle against modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership. With the strong support of vigilant masses, we Asian and African writers and people will certainly defeat our two great enemies of justice. Because the power of the people armed with truth is like an iron wall or the towering trees of Africa, it is invincible to any revisionist flies and imperialist ants. From now on, let us engrave in our hearts a summary of the words of the great poet of Asia, also the eternal poet of revolutionary humanity, Mao Zedong: "The small globe has a few flies bumping into the wall. Buzzing, a few shrill cries, a few sobs. Ants climbing the locust tree boast of a great country, cicadas shaking the tree talk about how easy it is."

	Da Cruz spoke about the issue of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam that this emergency meeting of Asian and African writers is to discuss. He said that the Vietnam War, in essence, is on the one hand the war of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world against imperialism, and on the other hand, it is the war of imperialism led by American imperialism against the people.

	Da Cruz exposed the deception of Soviet revisionists in the so-called aid to Vietnam. He said that the so-called aid of Soviet revisionists is actually only a small number of outdated old weapons. The number is far less than the aid they constantly flatter and send to the Indian reactionaries. Soviet revisionists know very well that while burying American imperialism in Vietnam, they are also ringing the inevitable death knell for modern revisionism. Whether alive or dead, their fate is inseparably linked with that of American imperialism. Therefore, they have adopted a policy of true betrayal and extremely treacherous policy disguised as hypocritical clothing towards the Vietnamese people. These facts show that to enable the people to defeat imperialism, the responsibility of Asian and African writers must be to oppose the head of revisionism—Soviet revisionism.

	Da Cruz also talked about the ideological and cultural aggression of imperialism and modern revisionism against the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. He said, we Asian and African writers must fight on the two fronts of revolution: the literary and military fronts. One hand holds a pen, the other holds a gun. Without the people's revolutionary war, there can be no true liberation; and without true liberation, there can be no true national culture and cultural liberation of our country, and there can be no cultural revival of our people.

	Da Cruz expressed his belief that this emergency meeting will further unite Asian and African writers, establish a great army of revolutionary culture in Asia and Africa, and truly form the broadest revolutionary front of Asian and African writers. He said, the purpose of this great army's struggle on the cultural front is to support the armed struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa, because there is no literature that is detached from politics. Imperialism and revisionism, whether in politics or culture, are joined at the hip.

	Da Cruz analyzed the reactionary essence of Sholokhov's works.

	He said, Soviet revisionist writers and artists no longer distinguish between revolutionary war and counter-revolutionary war. They advocate reactionary humanitarianism. They no longer analyze society and history from the standpoint of class struggle. Revisionist writers and artists, like bacteria in the human body, poison the people with viruses, cowardice, terror, narrow individualism, corrupt life, chauvinism, racism, and so on.

	Da Cruz emphasized that only by overthrowing revisionist literature can Asian and African writers establish, develop, and bring to a peak revolutionary, popular, and democratic literature. Just as Mao Zedong said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." To establish, we must destroy; to open the way for the literature of the Asian and African peoples, we must demolish the obstacles, that is, the literature of imperialism and revisionism. This is the task assigned to us by the inevitable development of history, and it is also the great task assigned to us Asian and African writers and artists.

	He said, the revolutionary struggle aimed at victory requires revolutionary thought as a guide. Without revolutionary thought, there can be no invincible revolutionary movement. Of course, the revolutionary thought we are talking about here is revolutionary thought of a scientific nature: it faithfully reflects the true movement of things and the world. Here we should point out the extremely important significance of Mao Zedong's thought on carrying the revolution to victory not only in Africa and Asia but in the whole world.

	Da Cruz said: Mao Zedong's life is completely integrated with the greatest and victorious revolution in human history. Mao Zedong's genius has brilliantly developed the revolutionary theory that existed before he participated in the revolutionary struggle. Mao Zedong not only applied revolutionary theory to revolutionary practice but also, on the basis of the great and long revolutionary experience of the Chinese people and the people of the world, creatively developed revolutionary theory.

	He said, Mao Zedong's immortal contribution to revolutionary theory covers philosophy, politics, military affairs, economics, literature, art, and other aspects. Mao Zedong Thought has made very important and decisive contributions to issues such as national democratic revolution, people's war, opposition to American imperialism and its running dogs, and resolute opposition to modern revisionism and dogmatism, which has earned him fame and the love and respect of the broad masses of revolutionary people around the world. He is rightly regarded by these masses as the greatest revolutionary leader of our time.

	Da Cruz emphasized that revolutionaries should correctly recognize that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are indisputably the most complete and faithful reflections of our time. Mao Zedong Thought scientifically and comprehensively summarizes the struggles of the Chinese and world peoples, formulating correct policies, strategies, and tactics that conform to the great issues of world revolution in our time.

	In talking about the importance of studying Mao Zedong Thought, he said, if Asian and African writers do not master Mao Zedong's worldview and method of thinking, they cannot effectively fulfill their responsibilities to the people. Therefore, we believe that African and Asian writers, through serious study of Mao Zedong Thought, can not only highlight the truth that has been widely proven by practice but also grasp a weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb. This weapon can thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate imperialism and revisionism.

	He said, only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can Asian and African writers correctly solve the relationship between literature and politics, the relationship between writers and real life, and the relationship between writers and the masses of readers. We hope that we can recognize the necessity of mastering Mao Zedong Thought. We are convinced that Mao Zedong Thought will further expand, deepen, and consolidate the foundation of our common language, and this common language will increasingly become indispensable for our vigorous unity.

	The experience of the Chinese people and the revolutionary struggles of many peoples of various countries fully prove that Mao Zedong Thought is also a very powerful weapon for changing the objective world. Because in reality, it can infinitely mobilize the inexhaustible power of the masses of the people. This is why we believe that Asian and African writers, through their works, will undoubtedly spread Mao Zedong Thought, and this will undoubtedly contribute to the spiritual power of their own people, to the spread of truth, and thus to the elimination of the lies manufactured and spread by imperialism and revisionism.

	He went on to say, on the banner of Mao Zedong, the following slogan is written in golden letters: "Everything for the revolution!"

	On the black flag of the revisionist pirates, the following slogan is written in deceptive colors: "Everything for survival!"

	Da Cruz finally said passionately: Our hearts are burning with passion in our chests, we are not afraid of cold and dark clouds, we are not afraid of imperialism and revisionism. We press on bravely, loudly reciting Mao Zedong's poems: "Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves. The plum blossoms rejoice in the heavy snow, freezing to death a few flies is nothing to be surprised at."

	Da Cruz finally shouted enthusiastically: "Long live our teacher and comrade-in-arms, Mao Zedong!"

### 在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上  安哥拉代表达克鲁斯的报告

    全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。
    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    安哥拉代表达克鲁斯的报告
    新华社二十九日讯　安哥拉代表维里亚托·达克鲁斯今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，毛泽东是我们时代的最伟大的革命领袖。非洲和亚洲的作家通过认真学习毛泽东思想，能够掌握比原子弹更为强大的武器。这种武器能够彻底地、全面地、完全地消灭帝国主义和修正主义。
    达克鲁斯还指出，以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略本性丝毫未变，苏联现代修正主义鼓吹被压迫人民同帝国主义“和平共处”，证明它是帝国主义的最大帮凶。
    他强调说，要反对帝国主义就必须反对修正主义。认为不反对修正主义也可以打败帝国主义，这是严重的幻想。
    达克鲁斯说，正象毛泽东所说的，“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明”。为了坚持和传播真理，我们亚非作家应该揭露、谴责和反对现代修正主义。如果不坚决地把反对以苏联领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，那末在任何地方都不能真正地战胜帝国主义。
    达克鲁斯在报告中强烈谴责帝国主义在进行疯狂的血腥镇压的同时，肆无忌惮地在非洲和亚洲进行文化侵略。他说，亚非作家肩负着不可推卸的重大历史责任，那就是唤醒、动员和组织人民大众，把反对帝国主义的斗争毫不妥协地进行到底。
    他说，帝国主义永远也不会自动退出历史舞台。帝国主义从不放弃暴力。就其本性而言，它只会采用暴力。其结果是帝国主义使我们懂得武装斗争是人民反帝斗争的主要形式。
    达克鲁斯说，为了反对帝国主义，我们要扫除人民在前进道路上的绊脚石，这就是修正主义的关于“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”、“和平共处”的谬论。我们还必须反对现代修正主义的文艺，因为现代修正主义的文艺只不过是帝国主义思想意识的新的变种，是现代修正主义政策在思想意识方面的反映，它口头上反帝，实际上为敌人服务，同帝国主义真正地勾结在一起。
    达克鲁斯谴责了苏联现代修正主义者和美帝国主义勾结，欺骗和背叛世界革命人民。他说，苏联现代修正主义者宣称美苏合作能够解决一切世界问题。但是，安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、南非、津巴布韦的人民，能通过美苏合作得到解放吗？美苏合作能使亚非独立国家巩固他们的独立并真正走上经济解放吗？虽然我们对此感到可笑，然而事实是苏联修正主义者已把这些荒谬的东西制订成他们的政治路线。美苏合作只是修正主义背叛亚非和全世界人民神圣利益的一个无法掩盖的明显标志。
    达克鲁斯说，现代修正主义者采用了极其狡猾的政策，他们不断地挥动马克思列宁主义和民族民主革命的旗帜，这只是为了进一步背叛。他们为帝国主义起了一个其它任何亲帝国主义势力所不能起的作用。修正主义者在非洲曾经欺骗了许多人，他们在那里一直起着他们目前在越南所起的同一个美帝国主义的作用。如果撕下他们伪装非洲人朋友和恩人的假面具，人们必将会看到他们在非洲的政策的实质只不过是：时而他们插手进来，目的是为了以后背着非洲人民进行交易，为帝国主义效劳，而又脱身出来；时而他们尽可能深入地插手进来，以便把某一个非洲国家纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道中。这就是他们对安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚人民的解放运动的所作所为。
    他指出，这一切说明，我们必须把反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的斗争和反对以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争紧密地联系起来。有着警惕着的人民群众的强大支持，我们亚非作家和人民必将战胜我们正义事业的两大死敌。因为由真理武装起来的人民的力量，就象铜墙铁壁或非洲的参天大树一样，是任何修正主义苍蝇和帝国主义蚍蜉都不能战胜的。从今以后，让我们把亚洲的伟大诗人、也是革命人类永恒的诗人、毛泽东所写的一首诗词的摘要铭刻在我们的心上：“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”
    达克鲁斯谈到了这次亚非作家紧急会议所要讨论的美帝国主义侵略越南问题。他说，越南战争，就其实质来说，一方面是亚非拉及世界其它地区的人民进行的反对帝国主义的战争，另一方面，是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义进行的反对人民的战争。
    达克鲁斯揭露了苏联修正主义者在所谓援助越南问题上的欺骗。他说，苏联修正主义者的所谓援助，实际上只是一些数量极小的过时的旧武器。数量远远小于他们不断献殷勤送给印度反动派的援助。苏联修正主义者很知道，在越南埋葬美帝国主义的同时，也对现代修正主义敲起了必然死亡的丧钟。不管生和死，他们和美帝国主义的命运是不可分割地连结在一起的。因此，他们对越南人民不断地采取用虚伪的外衣掩盖起来的真叛变和十分阴险的政策。这些事实说明，为了使人民能够战胜帝国主义，我们亚非作家的责任必须反对修正主义者的头子——苏联修正主义。
    达克鲁斯还谈到帝国主义和现代修正主义在意识形态和文化方面对亚非革命人民的侵略。他说，我们亚非作家要在革命的两条战线上作战：文武两条战线，一手拿笔，一手拿枪。没有人民革命战争，就不可能有真正的解放；而没有真正的解放，就不可能有我们国家的真正的民族文化和文化解放，就不可能有我们人民的文化复兴。
    达克鲁斯表示相信，这次紧急会议将进一步团结亚非作家，建立亚非革命文化大军，真正地组成最广泛的亚非作家革命阵线。他说，这支大军在文化战线上斗争的目的，正是要支援亚非人民武装斗争，因为根本不存在脱离政治的文艺。帝国主义和修正主义，无论是在政治方面还是文化方面，都是穿连裆裤的。
    达克鲁斯分析了肖洛霍夫作品的反动实质。
    他说，苏联修正主义的作家和艺术家，对于革命战争和反革命战争，已经不加区别，他们鼓吹反动的人道主义，他们不再以阶级斗争观点来分析社会和历史。修正主义的作家和艺术家就象人们身体机构中的细菌一样，以病毒、怯懦、恐怖、狭隘的个人主义、腐败的生活、沙文主义、种族主义等等来毒害人民。
    达克鲁斯强调说，只有打倒修正主义文艺，亚非作家才能把革命的、人民大众的和民主的文艺建立起来，加以发展，并推向高峰。就象毛泽东所说：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。要立就要破，要为亚非人民的文艺开辟道路，就必须摧毁障碍，即帝国主义和修正主义的文艺。这是历史必然发展运动所赋予我们人民的任务，也是赋予我们亚非作家和艺术家的伟大任务。
    他说，旨在取得胜利的革命斗争，要求以革命的思想作为指导。没有革命的思想，就没有战无不胜的革命运动。当然，我们在这里所说的革命思想是具有科学性质的革命思想：它忠实地反映事物和世界的真实运动情况。在这里我们应该指出毛泽东有关不仅在非洲和亚洲，而且在全世界把革命进行到胜利为止的思想的头等重要意义。
    达克鲁斯说：毛泽东的一生同人类历史上最伟大的、胜利了的一次革命完全融洽在一起。毛泽东的天才，杰出地发展了在他参加革命斗争以前所存在的革命理论。毛泽东不仅把革命的理论用于革命的实践，而且在中国人民和世界人民的伟大的、长期的革命经验的基础上，创造性地发展了革命的理论。
    他说，毛泽东对革命理论的不朽的贡献，涉及哲学、政治、军事、经济、文学、艺术等方面。毛泽东思想在民族民主革命、人民战争、反对美国帝国主义及其走狗、坚决反对现代修正主义和教条主义等问题所作出的十分重要的和决定性的贡献，已经使得他赢得了名望和全世界广大的革命人民群众的热爱和尊敬。他在这些群众中理所当然地被看作是我们时代的最伟大的革命领袖。
    达克鲁斯强调说，革命者应该正确地承认马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想无可争辩地是我们时代最完全的和最忠实的反映。毛泽东思想科学地和全面地总结了中国和世界人民的斗争，制订了正确地符合我们时代的世界革命大问题的政策、战略和策略。
    他在谈到学习毛泽东思想的重要性时说，我们亚非作家如果不掌握毛泽东的世界观和思想方法，就不能有效地完成我们对人民所应该担负的责任。因此我们认为，非洲和亚洲的作家，通过认真学习毛泽东思想，不仅能够突出为实践所广泛证实了的真理，而且能够掌握比原子弹更为强大的武器，这种武器能够彻底地、全面地、完全地消灭帝国主义和修正主义。
    他说，亚非作家只有掌握毛泽东思想，才能正确地解决文学和政治的关系、作家和现实生活的关系以及作家和读者群众的关系。希望我们能够认识到掌握毛泽东思想的必要性。我们深信，毛泽东思想将进一步扩大、加深并巩固我们共同语言的基础，对于我们生气蓬勃的团结来说，这共同语言日益成为必不可少。
    中国人民的经验和各国人民的许多革命斗争，充分证明了毛泽东思想也是改变客观世界的十分强有力的武器。因为实际上它能够无限地发挥人民群众用之不竭的力量。这就是为什么我们认为，亚非作家通过他们的作品传布毛泽东思想，毫无疑问必将对发挥本国人民的精神力量，对传播真理，因而对清除帝国主义和修正主义所制造和散布的谎言作出贡献。
    他接着说，在毛泽东的旗帜上，用金色大字写上了以下的口号“一切为了革命！”
    在修正主义海盗的黑旗上，用骗人的颜色涂上了以下的口号“一切为了活命！”
    达克鲁斯最后满怀激情地说：我们亚非作家火热的红心在胸怀中跳动，我们不怕严寒和乌云，不怕帝国主义和修正主义。我们勇往直前，高声朗诵毛泽东的诗篇：“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”
    达克鲁斯最后热烈高呼：“我们的导师和战友毛泽东万岁！”
