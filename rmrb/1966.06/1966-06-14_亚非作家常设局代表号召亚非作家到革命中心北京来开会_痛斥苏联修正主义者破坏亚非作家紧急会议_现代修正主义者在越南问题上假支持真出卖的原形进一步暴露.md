    Representatives of Secretary-General Senanayake of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and representatives of other member countries of the Bureau, in a conversation with reporters from this agency in Beijing on the 12th, pointed out that the so-called "consultation" meeting on the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting, which the Soviet modern revisionists are manipulating behind the scenes and is scheduled to be held in Cairo on the 15th, is completely illegal. Its purpose is to sabotage the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting to be held in Beijing to discuss issues such as supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people, to undermine the unity of the Afro-Asian writers in the anti-imperialist struggle, and to serve U.S. imperialism and reactionaries. They called on Afro-Asian writers to come to Beijing, the center of revolution, for a meeting.

    Manuvira, the representative of Secretary-General Senanayake of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, said that the split meeting to be held in Cairo from the 15th to the 17th is illegal and ridiculous because it has not been agreed upon by the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, nor has it been agreed upon by the member countries of the Bureau. This illegal attempt comes directly from the enemies of the Afro-Asian people and the struggling Vietnamese people—the fake revolutionaries, namely the modern revisionists. They are using some people to pull chestnuts out of the fire for them to sabotage the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting and split the Afro-Asian writers' movement.

    Manuvira said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau officially issued a communique in Colombo on April 16, stating that after consultation with member countries, the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau decided to hold the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing, and the Permanent Bureau meeting in Beijing on June 9 reiterated that the meeting would be held from June 27 to July 6. Senanayake did not entrust anyone or any organization to convene any meeting in Cairo.

    Manuvira said that the modern revisionists verbally support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, but they are now sabotaging our meeting to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. This clearly proves that they are colluding with the imperialists and betraying the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people and the Afro-Asian people.

    Manuvira called on Afro-Asian writers, together with the Afro-Asian people, not only to fight against imperialism headed by the United States, but also to wage a resolute struggle against the fake revolutionaries, because they are all the real enemies of the people.

    He expressed his belief that any conspiracies of imperialism and modern revisionism will not succeed and cannot prevent the victorious convening of the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting.

    Agam Wispi, the Indonesian representative, pointed out that this so-called "consultation meeting" is illegal, is a conspiracy to sabotage the Afro-Asian solidarity movement, and is manipulated behind the scenes by modern revisionists. The revisionists are attempting to use this divisive activity to undermine the struggle of the Afro-Asian people against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism because the struggle of the Afro-Asian writers is combined with the struggle of the Afro-Asian people.

    Wispi went on to say that this conspiracy makes us further realize that in order to win the struggle, it is not enough for the Afro-Asian people to only oppose imperialism, but they must also oppose revisionism that undermines the Afro-Asian revolutionary movement.

    Wispi pointed out that if the splitters hold illegal meetings, we Afro-Asian revolutionary writers must be more united to expose and smash their conspiracies, so that the upcoming Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing will be even more successful.

    Osman Hassan Ahmed, the Sudanese representative, pointed out that this so-called "consultation meeting" once again exposes the Soviet revisionists' complete surrender to U.S. imperialism—organizationally, they are implementing a line of divisionism in the revolutionary movements around the world. Afro-Asian writers should make the Afro-Asian people more clearly see who are their enemies and who are their friends.

    He said that this so-called "consultation meeting" is an insult to the African people who are fighting for freedom and liberation, a provocation to the revolutionaries, to the anti-imperialist writers of Asia and Africa. It is also a provocation to the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting. As long as the enemy sharpens his knife, as long as the enemy's purpose is to sabotage our revolutionary meeting, we must also sharpen our knife and smash this divisive activity. This divisive activity serves imperialism and attempts to separate the Afro-Asian people from their main struggle. I hope that those writers who cherish the strong and militant unity of Afro-Asian writers will join the ranks of the Afro-Asian revolutionary writers, come to Beijing, the center of revolution, and participate in this historic emergency meeting to provide militant support to the heroic Vietnamese people who are standing at the forefront of the anti-American struggle.

    Yoshikata Yoda, the Japanese representative, said that the Japan Liaison Committee of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference also received an invitation to send people to Cairo to attend the meeting. After research, the Japan Liaison Committee decided to ignore this invitation because it is illegal to convene any "consultation meeting" in Cairo. Yoshikata Yoda pointed out that everyone knows that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held meetings in Beijing on the 9th and 10th, reiterating that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people would be held in Beijing on June 27. These splitters not only do not accept the invitation to attend the Beijing meeting, but also hold another meeting in Cairo. This is obviously an act of helping the enemy to undermine the unity of the Afro-Asian people.

    Yoshikata Yoda said: This so-called "consultation" meeting is manipulated behind the scenes by Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists are trying to prevent the unity of revolutionary Afro-Asian writers. They have no sincerity in supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    Yoshikata Yoda went on to say that in the past, Soviet revisionists often undermined the Afro-Asian solidarity movement behind the scenes. For example, the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Japan every August 6 was split by them. We should expose the conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists and let the people of the world see the facts clearly. The Soviet people know these facts and will not support these revisionists. The conspiracy of the Soviet revisionists must fail.

    Fezze Marcel, the Cameroonian representative, said that the so-called "consultation meeting" that attempts to piece together is illegal because the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau has not authorized them to convene such a meeting. This is a conspiracy to split Afro-Asian solidarity. Progressive writers in Asia and Africa must resolutely expose this destructive conspiracy, continue the struggle, and ensure that we hold the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting successfully in Beijing. All those who collude with the splitters will be spurned by the Afro-Asian people.

    When reporters mentioned this so-called "consultation meeting" to the Ghanaian representatives, they said that the Ghanaian representatives only knew that they were sent to Beijing to participate in the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting. They did not know about other Afro-Asian writers' meetings held in other places.

    Liu Baiyu, the Chinese representative, said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting had already been agreed upon and decided by the vast majority of member states of the Permanent Bureau in April. But now the Soviet revisionists are planning to hold a so-called "consultation meeting" in Cairo, which is a blatant and serious step to undermine and split the cause of unity of the Afro-Asian writers and the Afro-Asian people.

    Liu Baiyu said that the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement was born in the anti-imperialist struggle of the Afro-Asian people. This movement reflects the revolutionary aspirations of the Afro-Asian people and Afro-Asian writers to unite against imperialism. It is advancing with the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Therefore, the Soviet modern revisionists have hated and undermined it from the beginning. This Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting is mainly to mobilize the people more widely to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The vast majority of Afro-Asian writers are determined to come to Beijing to participate in the emergency meeting and fight alongside their Vietnamese brothers. However, the Soviet revisionists not only refused to participate in the meeting, but also manipulated a small group of followers and people who did not understand the truth to direct a split meeting in Cairo, which further exposed its ugly face of feigning support but actually betraying the Vietnamese issue. In order to please U.S. imperialism and undermine the Afro-Asian national liberation movement, for several years, they have been constantly and maliciously attacking our Afro-Asian writers' organization and our respected Secretary-General Mr. Senanayake in the Soviet newspapers. Today, at this most urgent moment of the struggle, they stretched out that sinful hand from faraway Moscow to obstruct and sabotage. This is a shameful betrayal of the Vietnamese people and the Afro-Asian people who are throwing their heads and shedding their blood in heroic battles. This crime cannot but arouse great anger and severe condemnation from the vast number of Afro-Asian people and honest writers, and cannot but make them even more isolated, thereby placing themselves in a position to be judged by Afro-Asian writers and people.

    Liu Baiyu pointed out that what the Soviet revisionists have done in the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement is following the law of "making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until destruction." No force can stop the revolutionary upsurge of the Afro-Asian people. Imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionary forces will be crushed by the rolling wheels of history.

    As the host of the meeting, the Chinese people and Chinese writers warmly welcome writers and anti-imperialist fighters from Afro-Asian countries to come to Beijing to participate in the emergency meeting and discuss our common problems. We firmly believe that the great friendship between the Chinese and Afro-Asian people, the cause of unity against imperialism of the Afro-Asian people and Afro-Asian writers, cannot be undermined by any reactionary forces, and the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will surely be a complete success.

### 亚非作家常设局代表号召亚非作家到革命中心北京来开会  痛斥苏联修正主义者破坏亚非作家紧急会议  现代修正主义者在越南问题上假支持真出卖的原形进一步暴露

    亚非作家常设局代表号召亚非作家到革命中心北京来开会
    痛斥苏联修正主义者破坏亚非作家紧急会议
    现代修正主义者在越南问题上假支持真出卖的原形进一步暴露
    新华社十三日讯　亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的代表和常设局其他成员国的代表十二日在北京向本社记者发表谈话指出，由苏联现代修正主义者幕后操纵擅自要在十五日于开罗举行所谓就亚非作家紧急会议进行“协商”的分裂会，完全是非法的，其目的是为了破坏将在北京召开的讨论支援越南人民斗争等问题的亚非作家紧急会议，是为了破坏亚非作家反帝斗争的团结，是为美帝国主义和反动派效劳。他们号召亚非的作家到革命的中心北京来开会。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的代表曼努维拉说，十五日到十七日要在开罗召开的分裂会议是非法的，荒谬可笑的，因为这个会议并未得到亚非作家常设局秘书长的同意，也未得到常设局成员国的同意。这一非法的企图是直接来自亚非人民和正在斗争中的越南人民的敌人——假革命者，即现代修正主义者。他们利用一些人为他们火中取栗，来破坏亚非作家紧急会议，分裂亚非作家运动。
    曼努维拉说，亚非作家常设局四月十六日在科伦坡正式发表公报说，亚非作家常设局在同成员国协商后，决定在北京召开亚非作家紧急会议，六月九日在北京的常设局会议重申会期定在六月二十七日到七月六日。森纳那亚克并未委托什么人和什么机构在开罗召开什么会议。
    曼努维拉说，现代修正主义者口头上支持越南人民的斗争，但他们现在破坏我们这个支持越南人民斗争的会议。这就十分清楚地证明：他们同帝国主义者勾结，出卖越南人民和亚非人民的革命斗争。
    曼努维拉号召亚非作家与亚非人民一起，不仅要与以美国为首的帝国主义进行斗争，还要与假革命者进行坚决的斗争，因为他们都是人民的真正敌人。
    他表示相信，帝国主义和现代修正主义的任何阴谋诡计都不能得逞、都不能阻止亚非作家紧急会议的胜利召开。
    印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比指出，这个所谓“协商会”是非法的，是阴谋破坏亚非团结运动，是现代修正主义者在幕后操纵。修正主义者企图用这种分裂活动来破坏亚非人民反对以美帝为首的帝国主义的斗争，因为亚非作家的斗争与亚非人民的斗争是结合在一起的。
    维斯比接着说，这种阴谋使我们进一步知道，亚非人民为了斗争的胜利，如果只反对帝国主义，而不反对破坏亚非革命运动的修正主义是不够的。
    维斯比指出，如果分裂分子举行了非法的会议，我们亚非革命作家，要更加团结，来揭露和粉碎他们的阴谋，使即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议开得更为成功。
    苏丹代表奥斯曼·哈桑·阿赫迈德指出，这个所谓“协商会”，再次暴露了苏联修正主义者向美帝国主义完全屈服——在组织上，他们在全世界的革命运动中贯彻分裂主义的路线。亚非作家应当使亚非人民更清楚地看到谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。
    他说，这个所谓“协商会”是对正在为自由、解放战斗的非洲人民的一个侮辱，是对革命者们，对亚非反帝的作家的挑衅。也是对亚非作家紧急会议的挑衅。只要敌人磨刀，只要敌人的目的是要破坏我们革命的会议，我们也必须磨刀，粉碎这种分裂活动。这种分裂活动为帝国主义效劳，企图使亚非人民脱离他们的主要斗争。我希望那些珍视亚非作家强大和战斗的团结的作家们，加入到亚非革命作家的战斗行列，到北京，这个革命的中心参加这个历史性的紧急会议，给予站在反美斗争前列的英雄的越南人民以战斗的支援。
    日本代表依田义贤说，亚非作家会议日本联络委员会也收到了邀请派人去开罗参加会的邀请电，日本联络委员会经过研究决定不理睬这种邀请，因为在开罗召开什么“协商会”是非法的。依田义贤指出，谁都知道亚非作家常设局九、十两日在北京召开会议，重申在六月二十七日在北京召开支援越南人民斗争的亚非作家紧急会议，这些搞分裂的分子，不仅不应邀参加北京会议，反而要在开罗召开另外一个会，这显然是帮助敌人破坏亚非人民团结的行为。
    依田义贤说：这个所谓“协商”会议是苏联修正主义者在幕后操纵的。苏联修正主义者妄想阻止革命的亚非作家们的团结。他们根本没有支持越南人民斗争的诚意。
    依田义贤接着说，过去苏联修正主义者经常在幕后破坏亚非的团结运动。如每年八月六日在日本召开的禁止原子弹、氢弹世界大会就是被他们分裂的。我们应当揭露苏联修正主义者的阴谋，让世界人民看清事实。苏联人民知道这种事实，也不会支持这些修正主义的。苏联修正主义者的阴谋一定要失败的。
    喀麦隆代表费则·马赛尔说，妄图东拼西凑召开的所谓“协商会”是非法的，因为亚非作家常设局秘书长没有授权给他们召开这类的会议。这是一种分裂亚非团结的阴谋。亚非的进步作家必须坚决揭露这种破坏阴谋，继续进行斗争，保证我们在北京胜利召开亚非作家紧急会议。所有和分裂主义者同流合污的人，必将遭到亚非人民唾弃。
    当记者向加纳代表提到这个所谓“协商会”时，他们说，加纳代表只知道被派到北京来参加亚非作家紧急会议，在其他地方召开的其他亚非作家的会议，他们都不知道。
    中国代表刘白羽说，亚非作家紧急会议早已在四月由常设局绝大多数会员国所同意和决定了的。而苏联修正主义者现在竟然策划在开罗开一个所谓“协商会”，这是明目张胆的破坏和分裂亚非作家和亚非人民的团结事业的严重步骤。
    刘白羽说，亚非作家运动是在亚非人民反帝斗争中诞生的，这一运动反映了亚非人民和亚非作家团结反帝的革命愿望。它是高举反帝、反殖的旗帜前进的。因此苏联现代修正主义者从一开始就仇视和破坏它。这次亚非作家紧急会议，主要是为了更广泛地动员人民支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，绝大多数亚非作家决心要来北京参加紧急会议，同越南兄弟并肩作战。可是苏联修正主义者不仅拒绝来参加会议，反而操纵一小撮盲从和不明真象的人去开罗导演分裂会议，这就进一步暴露了它在越南问题上假支持真出卖的丑恶原形。它为了讨好美帝国主义，破坏亚非民族解放运动，几年来，在苏联报刊上早已不断恶毒地攻击我们亚非作家组织和我们尊敬的秘书长森纳那亚克先生，今天在这斗争最紧急的时刻，又从辽远的莫斯科伸出那支罪恶的手，进行阻挠和破坏，这是对于正在抛头颅、洒热血，英勇奋战的越南人民和亚非人民的可耻背叛。这一罪行，不能不引起亚非广大人民和正直的作家的极大愤怒和严厉谴责，不能不使它自己更加孤立，从而把它自己摆在被亚非作家和人民审判的地位。
    刘白羽指出，苏联修正主义者在亚非作家运动中的所作所为，正在沿着“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的规律行事。任何力量都阻止不住亚非人民的革命高潮。帝国主义、苏联修正主义者和一切反动势力，都将被滚滚前进的历史巨轮辗得粉碎。
    作为会议东道主的中国人民和中国作家，热烈欢迎亚非各国的作家和反帝战士，到北京来参加紧急会议，讨论我们的共同问题。我们深信，中国和亚非人民的伟大友谊、亚非人民和亚非作家的团结反帝事业，是任何反动势力所破坏不了的，亚非作家紧急会议是一定能获得圆满成功的。
