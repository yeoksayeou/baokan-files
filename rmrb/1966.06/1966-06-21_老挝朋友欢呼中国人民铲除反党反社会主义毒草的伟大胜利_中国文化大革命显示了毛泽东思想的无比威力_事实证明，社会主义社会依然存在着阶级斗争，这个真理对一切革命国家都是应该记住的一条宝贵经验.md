    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 19th. Some leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and Patriotic Neutralist Forces in the liberated area of ​​Xieng Khouang Province recently spoke to reporters from this agency, warmly praising the Chinese people for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out the Socialist Cultural Revolution. They said that this revolution demonstrated the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought. The victory achieved by the Chinese people in this revolution is also a victory for the Lao people.
    Singkapo, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, said: "The Socialist Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China is a new revolution. We are pleased to see that this is a struggle to purify cultural thought, a struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong." "Each of us has boundless faith in Chairman Mao Zedong. We know that Mao Zedong Thought is the crystallization of truth." He added: "The enemy attacks us from four aspects: political, economic, military, and cultural. We must also counter them from these four aspects."
    Saman, a leader of the Xieng Khouang Regional Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, said: "The Socialist Cultural Revolution being carried out in China this time is a great struggle to eliminate class enemies, defend socialist construction, and protect Mao Zedong Thought." He added: "The exposure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist Deng Tuo clique in China this time is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. It proves that Mao Zedong Thought has become the revolutionary theory of the Chinese people. Whoever violates Mao Zedong Thought will be immediately seen clearly by the people."
    Colonel Doune, Commander-in-Chief of the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, said: "People all over the world infinitely love the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. We will feel extremely indignant no matter who attacks him." He said: "This struggle on the cultural front in China this time is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and a struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism."
    He said: "The like of Deng Tuo are not only enemies of the Chinese people, but also enemies of the Lao people and the people of the world, because they are agents of imperialism, and we are resolutely opposed to imperialism and its running dogs."
    He said: "China is the frontline bastion in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and the revolutionary pillar of the oppressed nations and oppressed peoples of the world. Therefore, the enemy always tries every possible means to undermine China. As Chairman Mao Zedong said, 'It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy.' The enemy opposes you, which proves that your position against imperialism and colonialism is firm."
    He added: "The eradication of poisonous weeds in China this time is a major victory in consolidating the revolutionary ranks and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Your victory is our victory."
    Lieutenant Colonel Kongsy, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Military Command of the Patriotic Neutralist Forces, said that China's Socialist Cultural Revolution proves "the truth that class struggle still exists in socialist society." "This is a valuable experience that Laos and all revolutionary countries in the world should remember."
    Maha Kou, Acting Chairman of the Lao Peace Neutral Party, said: "The 'Three-Family Village' black shop headed by Deng Tuo used cultural positions to oppose the Chinese Communist Party and socialism, and it is not as easy to detect as enemies with guns. The Cultural Revolution in China this time has once again made us deeply aware that class struggle is a long-term and complex struggle. This experience is of practical significance to us." He said: "Only by adhering to Mao Zedong Thought can we thoroughly eradicate revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism." He added: "This handful of people like Deng Tuo are opposing the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong Thought, which is just like an ant trying to shake a big tree."
    Souliyong, Vice Chairman of the Lao Civil Servants Union, said: "We highly praise the Socialist Cultural Revolution carried out by the Chinese people. Your victory proves that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are strong, and whoever opposes the proletarian dictatorship will be eliminated." He added: "Your struggle this time is a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and it also shows the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary people who are struggling in the world."

    老挝朋友欢呼中国人民铲除反党反社会主义毒草的伟大胜利
    中国文化大革命显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力
    事实证明，社会主义社会依然存在着阶级斗争，这个真理对一切革命国家都是应该记住的一条宝贵经验
    新华社康开十九日电　老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量在川圹解放区的一些领导人，最近向本社记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开展社会主义文化大革命。他们说，这个革命显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力。中国人民在这个革命中所取得的胜利，也是老挝人民的胜利。
    老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表辛加坡说：“中国当前所进行的社会主义文化大革命是一次新的革命，我们高兴地看到这是纯洁文化思想的斗争，是毛泽东主席领导下的斗争。”“我们每个人都无比信仰毛泽东主席，我们知道毛泽东思想是真理的结晶。”他又说：“敌人从政治、经济、军事和文化四个方面向我们进攻，我们也必须从这四个方面去反击他们。”
    老挝人民解放军川圹地区指挥部领导人沙曼说：“中国这次进行的社会主义文化大革命，是消灭阶级敌人，捍卫社会主义建设和保卫毛泽东思想的一次伟大斗争。”他又说：“中国这次揭发出反党、反社会主义的邓拓集团，是毛泽东思想深入人心的新胜利。它证明毛泽东思想已经成为中国人民的革命理论。谁要违反毛泽东思想，人民马上就能看清楚。”
    老挝爱国中立力量军事指挥部总指挥敦上校说：“全世界人民都无限热爱中国共产党、中国人民和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，不论谁攻击他，我们都会感到无比愤慨。”他说：“中国这次在文化战线上的斗争是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是革命和反革命的斗争，是马克思列宁主义和修正主义的斗争。”
    他说：“邓拓之流不仅是中国人民的敌人，而且是老挝人民和世界人民的敌人，因为他们是帝国主义的代理人，而我们是坚决反对帝国主义及其走狗的。”
    他说：“中国是同美帝国主义及其走狗斗争的前线堡垒，是世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命支柱，所以，敌人总是千方百计地要破坏中国。正如毛泽东主席所说的，‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’，敌人反对你们，证明了你们的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的立场是坚定的。”
    他又说：“中国这次拔除毒草，是巩固革命队伍的一个重大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。”
    爱国中立力量军事指挥部副总指挥贡西中校说，中国的社会主义文化大革命证明了“在社会主义社会里阶级斗争依然存在的真理。”“这是老挝和世界上一切革命国家应该记住的一条宝贵经验。”
    老挝和平中立党代主席马哈古说：“以邓拓为首的‘三家村’黑店利用文化阵地来反对中国共产党、反对社会主义，不象拿枪的敌人那样容易发现。中国的这次文化大革命，使我们再一次深刻地认识到：阶级斗争是长期复杂的斗争。这条经验对我们是具有现实意义的。”他说：“只有坚持毛泽东思想，才能彻底铲除修正主义和防止资本主义的复辟。”他又说：“邓拓这一小撮人反对中国共产党、反对毛泽东思想，只不过是蚍蜉撼大树。”
    老挝公务员联合会副主席苏里翁说：“我们十分赞扬中国人民进行的社会主义文化大革命。你们的胜利证明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是强大的，谁要是反对无产阶级专政，谁就会被消灭。”他又说：“你们这次斗争是对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的一个沉重打击。这是毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利，它也向世界上正在斗争的革命人民显示了毛泽东思想的无比威力。”
