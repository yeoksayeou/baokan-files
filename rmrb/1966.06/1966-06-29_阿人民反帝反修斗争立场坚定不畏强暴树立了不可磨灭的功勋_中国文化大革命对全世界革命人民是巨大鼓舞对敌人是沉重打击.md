Comrade Zhou Enlai's Important Speech at the Mass Rally in Tirana

The people of Albania's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle is firm and unyielding, establishing an indelible merit. China's Cultural Revolution greatly inspires the revolutionary people of the world and is a heavy blow to the enemy.

The class struggle in the ideological realm of China today, fundamentally, is a struggle of restoration and anti-restoration. This struggle to uproot revisionism will further consolidate China's proletarian dictatorship, including dictatorship in all cultural realms.

New China News Agency, Tirana, June 27th

Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech at the mass rally in Tirana on June 27th is as follows:

Dear Comrade Enver Hoxha, dear Comrade Mehmet Shehu, dear Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, dear comrades and friends:

This is my third visit to your country. Every time we visit the brotherly country of Albania and meet the heroic Albanian people, we feel an indescribable excitement. I would like to take this opportunity to, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Government of China, and all the Chinese people, and on behalf of Comrade Mao Zedong, extend warm greetings and revolutionary salutes to the glorious Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, to the people of Tirana and all the Albanian people, and to the wise leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Not long ago, the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu visited our country, bringing great joy and inspiration to our people. This visit demonstrated the lofty friendship between our two parties, two countries, and two peoples, fully embodying the relationship between us, which is not just a friendship between ordinary friends, but a revolutionary comradeship and class brotherhood. The joint statement issued by both sides is a programmatic document of great historical significance, a major contribution to the international communist movement. The visit of the Albanian party and government delegation to our country has pushed our revolutionary friendship and combat unity to a new height.

In the past year and a half since my last visit to your country, your country has undergone inspiring and tremendous changes.

The hardworking and brave Albanian people, under the wise leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, have achieved new and great successes in socialist construction. You have successfully completed the third five-year plan, with significant development in industrial and agricultural production, and notable improvements in the material and cultural lives of the people. Now, the people of Albania have begun to implement the magnificent fourth five-year plan, striving to build a more solid industry, achieve self-sufficiency in grain, and make their motherland a more prosperous and powerful socialist country. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Albanian people on their brilliant achievements and wish you even greater victories in your future socialist construction.

The achievements of the Albanian people in socialist construction have been made under extremely difficult and harsh conditions, which is remarkable. Imperialism and modern revisionism surround and blockade you on all sides, attempting to sabotage and strangle your socialist construction. However, the heroic Albanian people have neither been intimidated nor crushed. With the heroic spirit of "preferring to die standing than to live kneeling," you have fought tenaciously, overcoming numerous difficulties on the path forward, and achieving one victory after another. Your country is becoming more prosperous every day, and your lives are becoming better every day. With your brilliant achievements, you have declared to the world that the imperialist and modern revisionist encirclement and blockade of you have failed.

We are particularly pleased to see that the Albanian people are pushing the socialist revolution forward more deeply. Recently, the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian government have taken a series of major measures in the political, economic, military, ideological, and cultural realms, with the central content being to highlight proletarian politics, further implement the mass line, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit, launching a nationwide, mass, and vigorous revolutionary movement. This is another vivid example of the Albanian Labor Party's creative combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with Albanian specific practices, embodying the Albanian Labor Party's spirit of continuous revolution. Under the inspiration of the party and government's revolutionary measures, the Albanian people are full of fighting spirit and vigor, and the country presents a lively revolutionary atmosphere. Your revolutionary movement is turning into a powerful material force, vigorously promoting the rapid development of Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Comrades and friends! Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, holding high the brilliant banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a nationwide class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, achieving one great victory after another. The country has presented an unprecedented good situation.

Our country's socialist revolution in the political, economic, military, and ideological realms is deepening. Proletarian dictatorship is becoming more consolidated and developed in all realms. Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the political awareness of the broad masses has greatly improved. The people of the whole country are more closely united around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Under the guidance of the party's general line for socialist construction, our people have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, pushing our socialist construction from one high tide to another. Our industrial and agricultural production has continued to grow, and our scientific and technological level has rapidly improved. This year is the first year of our third five-year plan. A mass movement of learning from Daqing, Dazhai, and the PLA, and of catching up and surpassing, is vigorously unfolding across the country. The entire national economy has entered a new period of leapfrog development.

The great achievements of our socialist construction have been made in the midst of unceasing class struggle and in the process of deepening socialist revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong has told us that the socialist society is a very long historical stage. In socialist society, after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been completed, classes and class contradictions still exist, and class struggle has not ended, but the form of class struggle has changed. Throughout the entire historical stage of socialism, there exists the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and the danger of capitalist restoration. To consolidate and develop socialism and prevent capitalist restoration, it is necessary to insist on proletarian dictatorship, to carry out the socialist revolution to the end on the economic front while carrying it out thoroughly on the political, military, and ideological fronts.

Repeated practice has made us increasingly deeply realize that Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society is extremely wise and completely correct.

In our country, the landlord and bourgeoisie have been overthrown, but they have not been completely eliminated. We have confiscated their material possessions, but we cannot confiscate the reactionary ideas in their heads. They are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They always want to restore their power. Although they account for a very small proportion of the population, their influence and resistance are much greater than their population proportion. Our urban and rural petty producers have been organized to engage in collective production. However, they still retain some of their original characteristics as petty producers. The capitalist spontaneous tendencies of urban and rural petty producers are constantly giving birth to new bourgeois elements. The working class is rapidly growing and expanding, but some complex elements have also infiltrated it. Due to the influence of the bourgeoisie and the corrupting effect of the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, and due to the existence and influence of the old social customs, some people in our party and government organs and cultural departments may also degenerate and become new bourgeois elements. At the same time, imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are using every means to surround and infiltrate us, carrying out subversive activities against us. All these factors make our country face the danger of revisionism and capitalist restoration.

To deny the existence of the danger of capitalist restoration in socialist countries or to underestimate this danger is completely wrong. However, as long as we correctly recognize this problem and do not evade it, insist on proletarian dictatorship, and insist on the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, correctly handle the contradictions among the people and the contradictions between us and the enemy, and carry out long-term, unremitting struggle, we can repel the enemy's repeated ferocious attacks. The history of class struggle in our country over the past sixteen years fully proves this.

Comrade Mao Zedong has summarized our country's practical experience in proletarian dictatorship and class struggle, studied the positive and negative experiences of the international situation, especially of the Soviet Union, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory on proletarian dictatorship and scientific socialism. In the past few years, our party has taken a series of fundamental measures based on Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings to prevent revisionism from usurping leadership, prevent capitalist restoration, ensure that our party and state will never change color, and ensure that we will carry the socialist revolution to the end and prepare for the future transition to communism.

In the countryside and cities of our country, we have extensively launched the socialist education movement. In this movement, we have thoroughly cleaned up the political, economic, ideological, and organizational aspects based on the principle of thorough revolution. We have fully mobilized the masses, organized and relied on the revolutionary class forces, correctly handled the contradictions among the people, united all those who can be united, and repelled the ferocious attacks of capitalist and feudal forces. At the same time, through this movement, we have conducted a profound class education and socialist education among the people, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. This movement has had extremely far-reaching significance and produced tremendous effects in consolidating the socialist front and proletarian dictatorship, consolidating socialist state ownership and collective ownership, and developing production.

The system of our broad cadres participating in physical labor has been gradually established since the Party Central Committee issued relevant instructions in 1957 and 1958. Cadres participating in collective production labor have an extremely important role in improving the ideological style of cadres and the relationship between cadres and the masses. Many errors among cadres are related to not participating in collective labor well. Detaching from collective labor is often the beginning of degeneration. Through participating in collective production labor, cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people, which is a fundamental matter in overcoming bureaucratism, preventing revisionism and dogmatism in the socialist system.

Our country is carrying out an educational revolution, thoroughly eliminating the influence of the bourgeois educational system, and thoroughly changing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. Now, our country is starting from changing the old enrollment and examination system, further comprehensively and thoroughly reforming our educational system. Students should focus on learning, but also learn other things. That is, they should not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize bourgeois ideology. The school system should be shortened. Half-work-half-study and half-farm-half-study schools should be gradually promoted. In all types of schools, it is necessary to implement the educational policy proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, to develop the students in moral, intellectual, and physical education, and to become socialist-conscious, cultured laborers. Our educational cause must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, implement the proletarian class line, and combine education with productive labor, creating conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between mental and physical labor.

In the past few months, a great high tide of proletarian cultural revolution has been vigorously unfolding in our country. This cultural revolution movement has powerfully impacted the rotten ideological and cultural positions still occupied by the bourgeoisie and feudal remnants. This is a very fierce class struggle in the ideological realm, a key issue in the deepening development of our socialist revolution at this stage, and a matter of primary importance related to the fate and future of our party and state.

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly instructed us to grasp ideology, grasp the superstructure, consolidate the proletarian ideological position, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and consolidate the economic foundation of socialism. The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party are also grasping ideology, grasping the superstructure, and carrying out anti-party and anti-socialist propaganda, preparing public opinion for capitalist restoration. Therefore, the current class struggle in the ideological realm of our country, fundamentally, is a struggle of restoration and anti-restoration.

At present, our hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, smashing the conspiracy of the bourgeois agents to usurp the leadership of the party and state. This struggle to uproot revisionism will further consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship, including dictatorship in all cultural realms. Our broad masses are thoroughly eliminating the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that have poisoned the people for thousands of years, and are creating and forming a brand-new proletarian new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits. This unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in human history is a great inspiration to the revolutionary people of the world and a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The experience of China shows that to prevent revisionism from usurping the leadership of the party and state and prevent capitalist restoration, the most fundamental thing is to highlight proletarian politics in all work. In our country, highlighting proletarian politics is to highlight Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly and creatively inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards extinction and socialism is heading towards world victory, and it is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Our broad cadres and workers, peasants, and soldiers regard Comrade Mao Zedong's works as the highest instructions for all work. They have achieved abundant results and opened up a new era for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism in the large-scale mass movement of studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works. The Chinese people have deeply felt in the long-term revolutionary struggle that Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon to defeat the bourgeoisie and revisionism. The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory!

In socialist countries, how to prevent revisionism from usurping the leadership of the party and state, how to prevent capitalist restoration, how to continuously consolidate and develop socialism, and gradually transition to communism, there is still no systematic and complete experience. The historical task of creating this experience falls on the shoulders of contemporary Marxist-Leninists. In this regard, our Communist Party of China has accumulated some experience, but it is still far from enough. We will continue to make our efforts. We are happy to be able to exchange experience with the brotherly Albanian Labor Party in this regard and learn from your revolutionary measures.

Comrades and friends! Our era is an era when capitalism is heading towards extinction and socialism is heading towards victory. In the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: "Now the situation in the world is such that the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces are engaged in their final struggle." The revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the imperialists led by the United States and their running dogs and accomplices, are engaged in a great struggle. The world is in fierce turmoil, and various political forces are undergoing drastic changes and re-combinations.

From the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, the current international situation is characterized by great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization, which is the result of the deepening development of the revolutionary struggle of the world's people, and it is a good thing, not a bad thing. In human history, whenever new and old social systems are replaced, such characteristics always appear. Turmoil raises the awareness of the people and accelerates the speed of social development. Division and reorganization make the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary lines more distinct, which is beneficial to the continuous advancement of the revolution. The frenzied counterattacks of imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries may temporarily succeed in some places. However, the counter-revolutionary tide can never stop the revolutionary mainstream.

American imperialism is the most arrogant and rampant invader in history. Its ambition is greater than anyone else's. Its reach is longer than anyone else's. It not only wants to destroy socialist countries and seize vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but it also implements the policy of "might makes right" towards its allies in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania. American imperialism appears to be a formidable giant, invincible, but in fact, like all reactionary forces in history, it has created a force to bury itself with its own actions. It is walking into the grave. American imperialism is everywhere bullying and doing evil, mobilizing the people of the world, including the American people, to surround it. The noose around its neck is more than any other imperialist in history. Its front is too long, its troops are insufficient, and its rear is too far away, which are more serious fatal weaknesses than those of past invaders. It not only repeats the mistakes of other imperialists but also makes more mistakes than them. The frenzy and weakness of American imperialism are most concentrated in its war of aggression against Vietnam. The more American imperialism flaunts its power around the world, the sooner the day will come when it is thoroughly buried by the people of the world.

The leadership of the CPSU is implementing a revisionism without Khrushchev. They have gone further than Khrushchev himself in restoring capitalism, surrendering to American imperialism, and practicing splitism and great-power chauvinism towards brotherly countries and brotherly parties. The revolutionary people of the world are increasingly recognizing that they are enemies of Marxism-Leninism, traitors to the international communist movement, destroyers of the revolutionary cause of the people of various countries, and accomplices of American imperialism. Therefore, opposing American imperialism must also mean opposing Khrushchev revisionism. The struggle against imperialism and the struggle against revisionism are inseparable. This is a test for all those who truly insist on the struggle against imperialism and truly insist on the struggle against revisionism. Some people, for various reasons, may not yet see this clearly, which is understandable. However, opposing Khrushchev revisionism is as much a matter of principle as opposing American imperialism. On matters of principle, there is no room for ambiguity. We believe that all true communists will ultimately stand on the correct side.

The domestic backtracking of Khrushchev revisionism has made it an enemy of the broad masses of the Soviet people, facing a series of insoluble sharp contradictions. Their position as the hegemon in the modern revisionist camp is increasingly weakened, and their command stick is increasingly ineffective. The prestige that the CPSU leadership once had has long gone. They are in trouble both internally and externally, more isolated than ever. Their collusion with American imperialism is being exposed by more and more people. Their various tricks on the Vietnam issue are of no help to them. The more Khrushchev revisionism struggles, the faster it will meet its final downfall.

The Vietnam issue is the focus of the current international class struggle and is also an important aspect of the dirty political collusion between American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism. In the past year, while expanding its aggression against Vietnam and carrying out war blackmail, American imperialism has repeatedly instigated the talk of peace, attempting to obtain through talks what it cannot obtain on the battlefield. The United States has put forward various deceptive slogans for peace talks, the latest of which is that it is also willing to resolve the Vietnam issue according to the Geneva Agreement and is actively instigating the reconvening of the Geneva Conference. This is a huge deception.

The Geneva Agreement is a matter of implementation or non-implementation, not a matter of reopening the Geneva Conference for further discussion. If the United States has the sincerity to implement the Geneva Agreement, it should accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, immediately stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam, and withdraw all American and puppet troops from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own problems. This is the essence of the Geneva Agreement. Without doing this, it is impossible to talk about resolving the Vietnam issue peacefully according to the Geneva Agreement, let alone the issue of reconvening the Geneva Conference. If an international agreement reached at an international conference is not valid, then what is the point of convening another international conference?

We, the Chinese people, and the Albanian people, together with the revolutionary people of the world, firmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation, and firmly expose and condemn the counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy of American imperialism. American imperialism wants to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, which is aimed not only at the peoples of Indochina but also at the Chinese people. The Chinese people will not retreat in the face of American imperialism's war threats. No matter what tricks American imperialism plays, no matter how high it escalates the war, and no matter what risks and costs we have to bear, we will fully support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and resolutely smash all the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism, thoroughly defeating the American aggressors.

Since Khrushchev's downfall, the new CPSU leadership has pretended to assist the Vietnamese people, but in fact, they are the same as Khrushchev, terrified by American imperialism's war blackmail. They assist Vietnam to sell out Vietnam. The Chinese and Albanian peoples have exposed this conspiracy of the CPSU revisionist leadership from the very beginning. They are at their wits' end, desperately playing new tricks to cover up their true face of selling out the Vietnamese people. In recent times, they have been loudly advocating "unity against imperialism" and "joint action" on the Vietnam issue in socialist countries. Many people who do not know the truth believe it, but this is completely a deception. Countless facts show that the line taken by the Soviet revisionist leadership is that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly dominate the world; their small anti-American moves on the Vietnam issue are completely to bring the Vietnam issue into the orbit of US-Soviet cooperation. The Soviet revisionist leadership is a genuine pro-American force, so how can we talk about taking anti-American "joint action" with them? It is absolutely impossible to make revolution with revolutionary traitors or to form an anti-imperialist united front with the accomplices of American imperialism.

In fact, what the Soviet revisionist leadership is really interested in is not "unity against imperialism" but to cooperate with American imperialism's two-pronged policy, using every means to instigate the peace talks conspiracy. They are making a lot of noise everywhere, proclaiming that the situation in Vietnam is worrisome, hinting that the United States has the sincerity to peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue, and instigating the so-called peace initiative to resolve the Vietnam issue. The recent clamor for convening a conference of non-aligned countries to discuss the Vietnam issue is inseparable from this instigation. Let us see who these so-called non-aligned countries are? One is the Indian reactionaries, and the other is the traitor Tito clique. They are not non-aligned countries at all, so what good can be done with this group of people? The Vietnam issue is an issue of aggression and anti-aggression. Taking a non-discriminatory, conciliatory attitude will only encourage the American aggressors. We believe that all countries in Asia and Africa that uphold justice and truly practice a policy of peace and neutrality should draw a clear line with the conference of non-aligned countries jointly instigated by American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique.

American imperialism, in order to concentrate its forces to invade Vietnam, is creating a false détente in Europe. The Soviet revisionist leadership actively cooperates, using various channels to instigate the convening of the so-called European Security Conference, attempting to apply the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to Europe. They have repeatedly stated that the Vietnam issue does not hinder them from reaching agreements with the United States on disarmament and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This is a big help to American imperialism and a big sellout to the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

The main danger in Europe comes from American imperialism. The United States, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has established many military bases in Europe, stationed a large number of troops, and attempted to control Western European countries and threaten Eastern European socialist countries. American imperialism has fostered West German militarism, turning West Germany into a bridgehead for its aggression in Europe. The threat of West German militarism to Europe, fundamentally, is the threat of American imperialism to Europe. It is clear that without resolutely fighting against American imperialism and West German militarism, it is impossible to guarantee the security of Europe.

However, the modern revisionism of the Soviet Union takes a policy of retreat and compromise towards American imperialism and West German militarism, giving up the struggle to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and resolve the Berlin issue, reaching a tacit agreement with American imperialism to freeze the status quo in Europe. Now, they keep talking about strengthening European security, but they never mention opposing American imperialism. The desire for peace of the European people is understandable, but the current false détente arranged by American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism can only help American imperialism strategically shift its focus to the East, fueling the revenge spirit of West German militarism. This approach, in the long run, will not only fail to ease the situation in Europe but will increase the danger of war in Europe.

Comrades and friends! Comrade Mao Zedong has told us: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear strong but are actually hollow inside because they are detached from the people. The people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, not be afraid of difficulties, and go forward bravely. In that case, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All demons will be destroyed. More and more facts show that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and Khrushchev revisionism is also a paper tiger. Adding one more Khrushchev revisionism does not help American imperialism. Siding with American imperialism does not help Khrushchev revisionism. Under the blows of the revolutionary people of the world, American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism are already on the verge of collapse, gasping for breath. We should raise the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism higher, unite all the revolutionary people of the world, and firmly carry out the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries to the end, and carry out the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the CPSU leadership to the end.

The heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, have always fought against imperialism and modern revisionism with a clear stand and a clear distinction between friends and enemies, showing the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat that is not afraid of violence and dares to struggle. You have made indelible contributions to promoting the revolutionary cause of the proletariat of the whole world. The Chinese people are proud to have the Albanian people as such a strong comrade-in-arms. Let us two peoples be even more closely united, and together with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world, strive for the great victory of the cause of world peace, national liberation, people's democracy, and socialism, and march forward together.

The future of humanity is limitless and bright. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without an exploitative system will definitely appear.

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live the strong People's Republic of Albania!

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party!

Long live the beloved leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism!

    阿人民反帝反修斗争立场坚定不畏强暴树立了不可磨灭的功勋
    中国文化大革命对全世界革命人民是巨大鼓舞对敌人是沉重打击
    当前中国意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，归根到底，是一场复辟和反复辟的斗争。这场挖修正主义根子的斗争，将进一步巩固中国的无产阶级专政，包括在各个文化领域内的专政
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　周恩来同志二十七日在地拉那群众大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的恩维尔·霍查同志，亲爱的穆罕默德·谢胡同志，亲爱的哈奇·列希同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    这是我第三次访问你们的国家。每当访问兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚，会见英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的时候，我们总是感到无比的兴奋。我愿意借这个机会，以中国共产党、中国政府和全体中国人民的名义，以毛泽东同志的名义，向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向地拉那市人民和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民，向阿尔巴尼亚人民英明的领袖、中国人民亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志，致以热烈的问候和革命的敬礼。
    不久以前，以穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问了我国，给我国人民带来了极大的欢乐和鼓舞。这次访问显示了我们两党、两国和两国人民的崇高友谊，充分地体现出我们两国人民之间的关系，不是普通的朋友之间的关系，而是革命同志之间、阶级兄弟之间的关系。双方发表的联合声明，是一个具有伟大历史意义的纲领性文件，是对国际共产主义运动的一个重大贡献。阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在我国的访问，把我们之间的革命友谊和战斗团结推向了一个新的高峰。
    这几天来，我们一直处在你们真挚的、深厚的革命友谊的包围之中。你们对我们的热烈隆重的欢迎和极其亲切的接待，使我们深深感动。在这里，我代表中国党政代表团全体同志，向你们，阿尔巴尼亚党政领导同志们和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟姐妹们，表示衷心的感谢。
    从我上次访问你们国家到现在的短短一年多时间里，你们的国家发生了令人鼓舞的巨大变化。
    勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在社会主义建设中取得了新的巨大的成就。你们胜利地完成了第三个五年计划，工农业生产有了很大的发展，人民的物质和文化生活得到了显著的提高。现在，阿尔巴尼亚全国人民已经开始执行宏伟的第四个五年计划，为建立更加健全的工业，实现粮食自给，把自己的祖国建设成为一个更加繁荣富强的社会主义国家而奋斗。中国人民热烈地祝贺兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民所取得的辉煌成就，并且预祝你们在今后的社会主义建设事业中取得新的更大的胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设中的成就，是在极其艰难困苦的条件下取得的，是了不起的。帝国主义、现代修正主义四面包围你们，封锁你们，妄图破坏和扼杀你们的社会主义建设事业。但是，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民既没有被吓倒，也没有被压垮。你们一手拿镐，一手拿枪，以“宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生”的英雄气概，进行了顽强的斗争，克服了前进道路上的重重困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。你们的国家一天比一天繁荣，你们的日子一天比一天美好。你们以自己的光辉成就，向全世界宣告了帝国主义、现代修正主义对你们包围、封锁的破产。
    我们特别高兴地看到，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在把社会主义革命更加深入地向前推进。不久前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府在政治、经济、军事、思想、文化等领域内，采取了以突出无产阶级政治、进一步贯彻群众路线和发扬革命精神为中心内容的一系列重大措施，在全国掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的群众性的革命化运动。这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同阿尔巴尼亚具体实践相结合的又一个生动范例，体现了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的不断革命的精神。在党和政府的革命化措施的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚人民斗志昂扬，意气风发，全国呈现出一片生气勃勃的革命气象。你们的革命化运动，正在变成强大的物质力量，有力地推动着阿尔巴尼亚社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。
    同志们，朋友们！中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的光辉旗帜，在全国范围内展开了阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。全国出现了空前未有的大好形势。
    我国在政治战线、经济战线、军事战线和思想文化战线上的社会主义革命不断深入。无产阶级专政在各个领域内日益巩固和发展。毛泽东思想深入人心，广大群众的政治觉悟大大提高。全国人民更加紧密地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，我国人民发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，把我国的社会主义建设从一个高潮推向又一个高潮。我国工农业生产持续地增长，科学技术水平迅速地提高。今年是我国第三个五年计划的第一年。一个学大庆、学大寨、学解放军的比学赶帮超的群众运动，正在全国轰轰烈烈地展开。整个国民经济进入了一个新的跃进时期。
    我国社会主义建设的巨大成就，是在不断的阶级斗争中，在逐步深入的社会主义革命中取得的。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，社会主义社会是一个很长的历史阶段，在社会主义社会里，在完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，阶级和阶级矛盾仍然存在，阶级斗争并没有结束，只是阶级斗争的形式变了。在整个社会主义的历史阶段中，存在着无产阶级同资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险。为了巩固和发展社会主义、防止资本主义复辟，必须坚持无产阶级专政，在继续进行经济战线上的社会主义革命的同时，把政治战线上、军事战线上和思想文化战线上的社会主义革命进行到底。
    反复的实践，使我们越来越深刻地认识到，毛泽东同志关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，是十分英明的，是完全正确的。
    在我国，地主资产阶级被打倒了，但是没有完全消灭。我们没收了他们的物质，但是不能没收他们脑袋里的反动思想。他们人还在，心不死。他们总是想复辟的。他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是他们的影响和反抗力量比他们的人口比例大得多。我国的城乡小生产者已经组织起来，进行集体生产。但是，他们还保留着原来小生产者的某些固有的特点。城乡小生产者的资本主义自发倾向，不断地生长新的资产阶级分子。工人队伍迅速地增长和扩大，也渗进了一些复杂的成分。由于资产阶级的影响和小资产阶级自发势力的腐蚀作用，由于旧社会习惯势力的存在和影响，在我国的党政机关和文教部门中，也会有些人蜕化变质，成为新的资产阶级分子。同时，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派千方百计地对我们进行包围和渗透，对我们进行颠覆活动。所有这些，都使得我国有产生修正主义、复辟资本主义的危险。
    否认在社会主义国家中存在着资本主义复辟的危险，对这种危险估计不足，是完全错误的。但是，只要我们正确地认识这个问题，而不是回避这个问题，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，正确地处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾，进行长期的、坚持不懈的斗争，我们就能够打退阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂进攻。十六年来我国阶级斗争的历史，充分地证明了这一点。
    毛泽东同志总结了我国无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的实践经验，研究了国际的主要是苏联的正面经验和反面经验，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政和科学社会主义的学说。这几年来，我们党根据毛泽东同志的教导，采取了一系列根本性的措施，来避免修正主义篡夺领导，防止资本主义复辟，保证我们的党和国家永不变色，保证我国把社会主义革命进行到底，以备将来胜利地向共产主义过渡。
    我们在全国的农村和城市，广泛地展开了社会主义教育运动。在这个运动中，我们根据彻底革命的原则，在政治、经济、思想和组织这四个方面进行清理。我们充分发动群众，组织和依靠革命的阶级队伍，正确地处理人民内部矛盾，团结一切可以团结的人，打退资本主义势力和封建势力的猖狂进攻。同时，通过这次运动，在人民群众中进行一次深刻的阶级教育和社会主义教育，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想。这个运动，对于巩固社会主义阵地和无产阶级专政，对于巩固社会主义全民所有制和集体所有制，对于发展生产，有着极其深远的意义，产生了巨大的效果。
    我国广大干部参加体力劳动的制度，在我们党中央于一九五七年、一九五八年发布了有关的指示以后，已经逐步地建立起来。干部参加集体生产劳动，对于改进干部的思想作风，改进干部和群众的关系，有极其重大的作用。干部中间产生的很多错误，都是同不好好参加集体劳动有关系的。脱离集体劳动，往往就是蜕化变质的开始。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，这是在社会主义制度下克服官僚主义、防止修正主义和教条主义的一件带根本性的大事。
    我国正在进行一场教育大革命，彻底清除资产阶级教育制度的影响，彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。现在，我国正从改变旧的招生考试制度开始，进一步全面地彻底地改革我国的教育制度。学生以学为主，兼学别样。也就是不但要学文，也要学工，学农，学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短。要逐步推广半工半读、半农半读的学校。在各类学校中，必须贯彻实行毛泽东同志提出的使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者这个教育方针。我国的教育事业，必须以毛泽东思想为指导，突出无产阶级政治，贯彻无产阶级的阶级路线，实行教育与生产劳动相结合，为逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别创造条件。
    最近几个月来，一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮，在我国轰轰烈烈地展开。这个文化革命运动，有力地冲击着资产阶级和封建残余还保存的一切腐朽的思想阵地和文化阵地。这是在意识形态领域内的一场十分激烈的阶级斗争，是现阶段我国社会主义革命深入发展的关键问题，是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途的头等大事。
    毛泽东同志一再教导我们，要抓意识形态，抓上层建筑，巩固无产阶级的思想阵地，巩固无产阶级专政，巩固社会主义的经济基础。混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，也在抓意识形态，抓上层建筑，进行反党反社会主义的宣传，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。因此，当前我国意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，归根到底，是一场复辟和反复辟的斗争。
    目前，我国的亿万工农兵群众、广大革命干部和广大革命的知识分子，以毛泽东思想为武器，正在横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，粉碎资产阶级的代理人篡夺党和国家领导的阴谋。这一场挖修正主义根子的斗争，将进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政，包括在各个文化领域内的专政。我国广大人民，正在彻底破除几千年来剥削阶级毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，正在创造和形成崭新的无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。这一场人类历史上空前的无产阶级文化大革命，对全世界革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，对于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派是一个沉重的打击。
    中国的经验说明，防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟，最根本的一条就是要在一切工作中突出无产阶级政治。在我国，突出无产阶级政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志天才地创造性地全面地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向灭亡和社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我国广大干部和工农兵群众把毛泽东同志的著作当作各项工作的最高指示。他们活学活用毛泽东同志著作的大规模的群众性学习运动，已经在政治、思想、经济以及军事等方面，结出了丰硕的果实，开创了工农兵群众直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元。中国人民在长期的革命斗争实践中，深切地体会到，毛泽东思想是我们战胜资产阶级和修正主义的最强大武器。毛泽东思想的旗帜就是胜利的旗帜！
    在社会主义国家里，如何防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，如何防止资本主义复辟，如何不断巩固和发展社会主义，逐步向共产主义过渡，还没有一套系统的完整的经验。创造这个经验的历史任务，落在当代马克思列宁主义者的肩上。在这方面，我们中国共产党已经积累了一些经验，但是还很不够。我们将继续作出自己的努力。我们感到高兴的是，能够同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党交流这方面的经验，并且从你们的革命化措施中得到教益。
    同志们，朋友们！我们的时代，是资本主义走向灭亡，社会主义走向胜利的时代。用毛泽东同志的话来说：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。”全世界革命势力和反革命势力之间，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶之间，正在进行一场大搏斗。全世界处在激烈的动荡之中，各种政治力量正在剧烈地分化和重新组合。
    从马克思列宁主义的观点来看，当前国际形势中出现大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面，是世界人民革命斗争深入发展的结果，是好事，不是坏事。在人类历史上，凡是新旧社会制度交替的时候，总是出现这样的特点。动荡提高人民的觉悟，加快社会发展的速度。分化和改组把革命和反革命的阵线划得更加分明，有利于革命的不断前进。帝国主义和各国反动派的疯狂反扑，可能一时在某些地方得逞。但是，反革命的逆流，永远也阻挡不住革命的主流。
    美帝国主义是历史上最狂妄、最猖狂的侵略者。它的野心比谁都大。它的手伸得比谁都长。它不仅要消灭社会主义国家，囊括亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的广大地区，而且对它在西欧、北美和大洋洲的盟国，也实行“弱肉强食”的政策。美帝国主义看上去是一个庞然大物，不可一世，其实，它同历史上的一切反动势力一样，用自己的行动造成了一个埋葬自己的力量。它正在走进坟墓。美帝国主义到处横行霸道，尽做坏事，动员了全世界人民包括美国人民起来包围它。它的脖子上套的绞索比历史上任何一个帝国主义都多。它的战线太长、兵力不足、后方太远的致命弱点，比过去的侵略者更加严重。它不但重复着别的帝国主义的错误，而且犯着比他们更多的错误。美帝国主义的疯狂性和虚弱性在它侵略越南的战争中最集中地表现出来。美帝国主义越是在全世界张牙舞爪，它被全世界人民彻底埋葬的日子也就会越早到来。
    苏共领导集团，实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。他们在复辟资本主义、投降美帝国主义、对兄弟国家和兄弟党实行分裂主义和大国沙文主义方面，比赫鲁晓夫本人走得更远。全世界革命人民越来越清楚地认识到，他们是马克思列宁主义的敌人，国际共产主义运动的叛徒，各国人民革命事业的破坏者，美帝国主义的帮凶。因此，反对美帝国主义必须反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义。反帝斗争和反修斗争不可分割。这是对一切真正坚持反帝斗争和真正坚持反修斗争人们的考验。有些人由于种种原因，一时还看不清楚这一点，这是可以理解的。但是，反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义同反对美帝国主义一样，是一个原则问题。在原则问题上不允许模棱两可。我们相信，一切真正的共产党人最终是会站到正确的立场上来的。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义在国内的倒行逆施，同广大的苏联人民为敌，遭到广大的苏联人民的反对，使他们面临着一系列无法解决的尖锐矛盾。他们在现代修正主义集团里的霸主地位越来越削弱，他们的指挥棒越来越不灵。苏共领导集团比赫鲁晓夫本人更狡猾，也比赫鲁晓夫本人更虚弱，当年赫鲁晓夫一度有过的那种威势，早已一去不复返了。他们内外交困，空前孤立。他们勾结美帝国主义的真相被越来越多的人所识破。他们在越南问题上玩弄的种种花招，丝毫也不能对他们有所帮助。赫鲁晓夫修正主义越是挣扎，越是使他们更快地走向最终垮台的下场。
    越南问题是当前国际阶级斗争的焦点，也是美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义进行肮脏的政治勾结的重要方面。一年多来，美帝国主义在扩大对越南的侵略、进行战争讹诈的同时，不断地策动和谈骗局，企图通过和谈得到它在战场上得不到的东西。美国提出过种种欺骗性的和谈口号，最新的一个是说，它也愿意按照日内瓦协议解决越南问题，并且从各方面策动重新召开日内瓦会议。这是一个莫大的骗局。
      日内瓦协议是一个执行或不执行的问题，而不是重开一次日内瓦会议重新进行讨论的问题。如果美国有执行日内瓦协议的诚意，它就应该接受越南民主共和国的四项主张和作为南越人民唯一合法代表的越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，立即停止对整个越南的侵略，从越南南方全部撤出美国及其仆从国家的侵略军，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。这是日内瓦协议的实质。不这样做，就谈不上根据日内瓦协议和平解决越南问题，更谈不上重开日内瓦会议的问题。如果开一次国际会议达成了国际协议不算数，那么，再开一次国际会议不是自欺欺人吗？
    我们中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民，同全世界革命人民一道，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，坚决揭露和谴责美帝国主义的反革命两手策略。美帝国主义要扩大侵略越南的战争，是针对印度支那各国人民的，也是针对中国人民的。中国人民决不在美帝国主义的战争威胁面前退缩，中国人民不管美帝国主义耍什么花招，把战争升到哪一级，也不管要承担多大的风险，付出多大的代价，都将全力支持越南人民的正义斗争，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    自从赫鲁晓夫下台以后，苏共新领导就装出一副援助越南人民的样子，其实，他们同赫鲁晓夫一样，在美帝国主义的战争讹诈面前吓破了胆。他们援助越南是为了出卖越南。中国和阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，从一开始就揭穿了苏共修正主义领导集团的这个阴谋。他们走投无路，竭力玩弄新的花招，掩盖他们出卖越南人民的真面目。最近一个时期以来，他们对社会主义国家大肆鼓吹在越南问题上“团结反帝”、“联合行动”。许多不明底细的人信以为真，其实这完全是一个骗局。无数的事实表明，苏联修正主义领导集团实行的路线，是美苏合作主宰世界；他们在越南问题上的一点反美小动作，完全是为了把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道。苏联修正主义领导集团是一支地地道道的亲美的力量，同他们怎么谈得上采取什么反美“联合行动”呢？绝不能同革命的叛徒在一起搞革命，绝不能同美帝国主义的帮凶在一起搞什么反美统一战线。
    其实，苏联修正主义领导集团真正有兴趣的，也决不是什么“联合反帝”，而是配合美帝国主义的两手政策，千方百计地策动和谈阴谋。他们到处虚张声势地宣扬什么越南的局势值得忧虑，到处暗示美国有和平解决越南问题的诚意，到处策动所谓和平解决越南问题的倡议。最近甚嚣尘上的所谓召开不结盟国家会议来讨论越南问题，是同这种策动分不开的。让我们看一看，所谓不结盟国家是哪一些人呢？一个是印度反动派，又一个是叛徒铁托集团。他们根本不是什么不结盟国家，同这一伙人在一起会做出什么好事来呢？越南问题是一个侵略和反侵略的问题，采取不分是非、折衷主义的态度，只能鼓励美国侵略者。我们认为，一切主持正义的亚非国家和真正奉行和平中立政策的不结盟国家都应该同美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团共同策动的不结盟国家会议划清界线。
    美帝国主义为了集中力量侵略越南，在欧洲搞假缓和。苏联修正主义领导集团积极配合，通过各种渠道策动召开所谓欧洲安全会议，企图把所谓“塔什干精神”运用到欧洲。他们反复表明，越南问题并不妨碍他们同美国达成裁军和防止核扩散的协议。这是对美帝国主义的大帮忙，这是对越南人民和全世界人民的大出卖。
    欧洲的危险主要来自美帝国主义，美国通过北大西洋公约组织，在欧洲建立许多军事基地，派驻大量军队，力图控制西欧国家，威胁东欧社会主义国家。美帝国主义一手扶植西德军国主义，把西德变成它侵略欧洲的桥头堡。西德军国主义对欧洲的威胁，从根本上说来，是美帝国主义对欧洲的威胁。很明显，不同美帝国主义和西德军国主义进行坚决的斗争，就谈不上保障欧洲的安全。
    但是，苏联现代修正主义对美帝国主义和西德军国主义采取退让妥协的政策，放弃争取缔结对德和约和解决西柏林问题的斗争，同美帝国主义达成冻结欧洲现状的默契。现在，他们口口声声要加强欧洲的安全，但却绝口不提反对美帝国主义。欧洲人民的和平愿望是可以理解的，但是，目前美帝国主义同苏联现代修正主义合伙安排的这种假缓和，只能帮助美帝国主义战略重点东移，助长西德军国主义的复仇气焰。这种做法，从长远来看，非但不能缓和欧洲的局势，而只能增加欧洲的战争危险。
    同志们，朋友们！毛泽东同志告诉我们：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，他们貌似强大，其实是外强中干，因为他们脱离人民。全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。越来越多的事实表明美帝国主义是纸老虎，赫鲁晓夫修正主义也是纸老虎。多了一个赫鲁晓夫修正主义，帮不了美帝国主义的忙。投靠美帝国主义，也帮不了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的忙。在全世界革命人民的打击下，美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义已经日薄西山，气息奄奄了。我们应当更高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，团结全世界一切革命人民，坚定不移地把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，一贯对帝国主义和现代修正主义进行针锋相对的斗争。在这个斗争中，你们立场坚定，敌友分明，表现了不畏强暴、敢于斗争的无产阶级革命精神。你们为推进全世界无产阶级的革命事业建树了不可磨灭的功勋。中国人民为有阿尔巴尼亚人民这样坚强的战友而感到自豪。让我们两国人民更加紧密地团结起来，同全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命的人民一道，为争取世界和平、民族解放、人民民主和社会主义事业的伟大胜利并肩战斗，共同前进。
    人类的前途是无限光明的。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界是一定要出现的。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    坚强的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖、中国人民亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中阿两党、两国、两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
