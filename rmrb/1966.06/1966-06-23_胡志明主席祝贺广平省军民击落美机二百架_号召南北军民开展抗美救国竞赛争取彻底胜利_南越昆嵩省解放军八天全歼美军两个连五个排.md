    Calls on Military and Civilians in the North and South to Launch an Anti-American National Salvation Emulation Drive to Strive for Complete Victory
    South Vietnamese Kontum Province Liberation Army Completely Annihilates Two American Companies and Five Platoons in Eight Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th—Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote a letter on the 14th to the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province, warmly congratulating them on shooting down 200 American bandit planes.
    The congratulatory letter said that Quang Binh Province was the first province to shoot down 100 American bandit planes. Now, Quang Binh Province is the first to shoot down 200 American planes, setting a good example for other fraternal provinces to learn from.
    Chairman Ho pointed out in his letter that the more the enemy fails, the more frenzied and ferocious they become. Therefore, we must not be subjectively careless due to victory; we must always heighten our vigilance, vigorously launch emulation drives with the heroic Southern military and civilians, work harder to improve combat and production, and together with our compatriots throughout the country, resolutely resist American aggression and save the nation until complete victory.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st—According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Kontum Province in South Vietnam achieved brilliant victories from June 3rd to 10th in encircling and striking at reinforcements north of Kontum Province. According to preliminary reports, a total of four enemy companies and seven platoons were completely annihilated, including two American companies and five platoons completely annihilated; at the same time, two other companies of puppet troops suffered heavy casualties. The Liberation Armed Forces also seized more than 300 weapons of various kinds and a batch of military supplies.
    The report said that after the Liberation Armed Forces heavily besieged the enemy's Du Mo Long military sub-district, about 50 kilometers north of Kontum City, the American aggressors and their running dogs were very panicked. On June 3rd, they dispatched helicopters to airlift a batch of puppet troops to reinforce the area, attempting to relieve the siege of the Du Mo Long defenders. However, as soon as this enemy reinforcement arrived in the De Bo Long area, it was ambushed by the Liberation Armed Forces, and two companies were completely annihilated, another company suffered heavy casualties, and four helicopters and one F-4 jet fighter were shot down.
    Under this heavy blow from the Liberation Armed Forces, the Du Mo Long defenders were even more terrified, and many puppet troops deserted. The enemy had no choice but to send troops from the American 101st Airborne Division to De Bo Long on the 6th to rescue the puppet troops. The Liberation Armed Forces quickly moved close to this enemy force and launched a surprise attack on the American command post at 1:00 a.m. on the 7th. Under the Liberation Armed Forces' unexpected and fierce attack, the enemy troops were thrown into chaos. After only three hours of combat, the Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated five American platoons and two puppet platoons, destroyed nine enemy military trucks, and seized nearly 200 weapons of various kinds.
    The next day, the Liberation Army intercepted two companies of American troops fleeing from De Bo Long, again eliminating more than 100 enemy soldiers. In this battle, the American aggressor troops were battered by the Liberation Army and were utterly disgraced.
    Subsequently, the Liberation Armed Forces took advantage of their victory to pursue the enemy on the 9th and 10th, engaging in ten battles with the enemy and annihilating two more American companies, seizing many weapons and a large amount of military supplies, including two heavy machine guns and forty light machine guns.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th—According to reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: Guerrilla units in the provinces of Thu Dau Mot, Tay Ninh, Thua Thien, and Quang Tri in South Vietnam launched attacks on the enemy in June and continuously achieved new victories.
    From June 2nd to 8th, guerrilla units in Thu Dau Mot Province repeatedly intercepted and attacked American and puppet troops, eliminating a total of 146 enemy soldiers, including 108 American aggressor troops and completely annihilating one puppet platoon. Guerrilla units in Chanh Phu Hoa commune, Ben Cat district alone killed and wounded 102 American aggressor troops, seized four light machine guns, and a batch of military supplies.
    In the first ten days of June, guerrilla units in Tay Ninh Province repeatedly frustrated the "sweeps" carried out by American aggressor troops against An Ninh and Loc Hung communes in Chan Thanh district and continuously attacked American military bases and infiltrated Chan Thanh town to strike at the enemy, eliminating a total of 148 enemy soldiers, including 108 American aggressor troops, and destroying one military vehicle.
    From June 9th to 11th, guerrilla units in Phong Dien district, Thua Thien Province, continuously intercepted American Marines and puppet troops who were "sweeping" Phong Son and Phong Nguyen communes, killing and wounding a total of 80 enemy soldiers, including 38 American aggressor troops, and destroying three M-113 armored vehicles.
    On June 5th, guerrilla units in Trieu Phong district, Quang Tri Province, destroyed one American military vehicle on Highway 1, eliminating six American aggressor troops. The next day, guerrilla units in Cam Lo district killed 15 puppet troops. In these two battles, the guerrilla units seized all the enemy's weapons and military supplies.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd—Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have been continuously attacking American aggressor troops in recent days.
    According to Western news agencies, on the morning of the 22nd, the Liberation Armed Forces again shelled the American helicopter airport in Soc Trang. Preliminary reports said that the facilities at the airport were destroyed, and the American troops stationed there suffered considerable casualties.
    Late on the 21st, the Liberation Armed Forces attacked two companies of the American 3rd Marine Division 25 kilometers southwest of Da Nang.
    In the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen Province, the Liberation Armed Forces repeatedly attacked the American 1st Cavalry Division and 101st Airborne Division troops who were carrying out "sweeps" on the 20th and 21st.

    胡志明主席祝贺广平省军民击落美机二百架
    号召南北军民开展抗美救国竞赛争取彻底胜利
    南越昆嵩省解放军八天全歼美军两个连五个排
    新华社河内二十日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明十四日写信给广平省军民，热烈祝贺他们击落美国强盗飞机二百架。
    贺信说，广平省是第一个击落美国强盗飞机一百架的省。现在，广平省又第一个击落美国飞机二百架，为各兄弟省树立了良好的学习榜样。
    胡主席在信中指出，敌人越是失败，就越疯狂凶恶。因此，不能因胜利而主观轻敌；必须时刻提高警惕，同英雄的南方军民大力开展竞赛，更加努力地搞好战斗和生产，同全国同胞一道，坚决抗美救国到彻底胜利。
    新华社河内二十一日电  据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方昆嵩省解放武装力量从六月三日到十日在昆嵩省北部围点打援，取得了辉煌的战绩。据初步消息，共全歼敌军四个连和七个排，其中全歼美军两个连和五个排；同时使另外两个连的伪军遭到惨重伤亡。解放武装力量还缴获各种武器三百多件和一批军用物资。
    报道说，在解放武装力量重重包围了昆嵩市北面约五十公里的都莫隆敌军事支区后，美国侵略者及其走狗非常恐慌。六月三日，他们出动直升飞机空运了一批伪军去增援，企图给都莫隆守敌解围。但是，敌人的这支援军刚来到德波隆地区，就遭到了解放武装力量的伏击，两个连被全歼，另一个连遭到惨重伤亡，四架直升飞机和一架F—4型喷气式战斗机被击落。
    在解放武装力量的这一沉重打击下，都莫隆守敌更是丧魂失魄，许多伪军纷纷开了小差。敌人只得于六日出动美国第一○一空降师的部队前往德波隆救援伪军。解放武装力量迅速运动接近这股敌人，于七日凌晨一时向美军指挥部发起突然袭击。在解放武装力量出其不意的猛烈袭击下，敌军乱成一团。仅仅经过三个小时的战斗，解放武装力量就全歼美军五个排和伪军两个排，炸毁敌人军用卡车九辆，缴获各种武器近二百件。
    第二天，解放军又截击从德波隆向外逃窜的两连美军，再次歼敌一百多名。在这次战斗中美国侵略军被解放军打得焦头烂额，丑态百出。
    接着，解放武装力量又在九日和十日两天乘胜追击，同敌人进行了十次战斗，又歼灭美军两个连，缴获包括重机枪两挺、轻机枪四十挺在内的许多武器和大批军用物资。
    新华社河内二十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方土龙木、西宁、承天、广治等省游击队在六月份里纷纷出击敌人，不断取得新的战果。
    土龙木省游击队在六月二日到八日期间，接连截击和袭击美伪军，共歼敌一百四十六名，其中包括美国侵略军一百零八名和全歼伪军一个排。单是边葛县正富和乡游击队就打死打伤美国侵略军一百零二名，缴获轻机枪四挺和一批军用物资。
    西宁省游击队在六月份头十天中，接连挫败了美国侵略军对盏盆县安静和禄兴两个乡进行的“扫荡”并不断袭击美军驻地和潜入盏盆镇打击敌人，共歼灭敌人一百四十八名，其中包括美国侵略军一百零八名，另外还炸毁军车一辆。
    承天省丰田县游击队从六月九日到十一日，连续截击前往丰山和丰源两个乡“扫荡”的美国海军陆战队和伪军，共打死打伤敌人八十名，其中包括美国侵略军三十八名，并击毁M—113型装甲车三辆。
    广治省兆丰县游击队六月五日在第一号公路上击毁美国军车一辆，歼灭美国侵略军六名。第二天，甘露县游击队又打死伪军十五名。在这两次战斗中，游击队都缴获了敌人的全部武器和军用物资。
    新华社二十二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量最近几天不断袭击美国侵略军。
    据西方通讯社报道，二十二日清晨，解放武装力量再次炮轰朔庄美军直升飞机机场。初步消息说，机场上的设施被毁坏，驻守的美军遭到不少伤亡。
    二十一日深夜，解放武装力量在岘港西南二十五公里处进攻了美国海军陆战队第三师的两个连。
    在富安省的绥和地区，解放武装力量二十日和二十一日接连袭击了前往“扫荡”的美国第一骑兵师和第一○一空降师的部队。
