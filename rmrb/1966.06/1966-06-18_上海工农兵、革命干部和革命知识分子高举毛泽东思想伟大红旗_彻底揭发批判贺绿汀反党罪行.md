    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th) After the letter from five comrades, Wan Li, et al., of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, exposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of He Luting, the president of the conservatory, was published in Shanghai newspapers on the 8th, it aroused great indignation and irrepressible anger. In recent days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Shanghai have written articles, written big-character posters, and held denunciation meetings, wielding the "golden cudgel" of Mao Zedong Thought to strike hard at He Luting, an important figure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the music circles, who is wearing the cloak of "old revolutionary musician" and "Communist Party member" and hiding within the Party. They solemnly pointed out: Anti-Party and anti-socialist element He Luting, no matter how senior your qualifications are, no matter how high your position is, no matter how deep your potential influence is, in the face of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the tempestuous storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, your wild attempt to realize capitalist restoration will be thoroughly exposed and thoroughly smashed.
    In extremely angry denunciations, the broad masses unanimously pointed out: He Luting, who has usurped positions such as President of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, and Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association, and has committed a series of crimes against Mao Zedong Thought, is echoing the anti-China chorus of all the demons and monsters internationally; is closely cooperating with the capitalist restoration activities of domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and the literary "authorities" and "patriarchs" of the 1930s, and is completely the same ilk as the "Three-Family Village" black gang. The "Three-Family Village" black gang used black language and black plays to slander Chairman Mao, oppose the Party Central Committee, and attack the dictatorship of the proletariat; He Luting used black language and black melodies to echo the "Three-Family Village" black gang, launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. What is even more infuriating is that He Luting clamored that literary criticism "should be nurturing flowers rather than cutting grass,"妄想only allowing their small handful of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" to set fires and spread poison everywhere, and forbidding all revolutionaries to criticize them. This is completely the same as the absurdities of "learn more, criticize less" and other nonsense shouted by the "Three-Family Village" black gang, coming from the same nostril. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers loudly warned He Luting: Your妄想attempt to engage in bourgeois counter-revolutionary dictatorship, not allowing us to rise up and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, is a pipe dream! You attack us as "hit men" and "cudgels," yes! You are right! We must exercise dictatorship over you, we must strike! Use the revolutionary "golden cudgel" to thoroughly strike you down.
    Jiang Lingen, an old worker at the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, said: After reading the extremely venomous fallacy of anti-Party and anti-socialist element He Luting, who frantically and gnashingly cursed the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune as "ready for the coffin," I was extremely angry. After listing many facts of the Great Leap Forward in his factory, he said: We workers just like the Great Leap Forward. Zhang Yuxiu, Deputy Director of the Huacao Commune in Shanghai County, and Hou Yindi, Vice Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association of the Liming Brigade, said: He Luting, this reactionary fellow, frantically attacked the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, completely speaking on behalf of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Without the Party and Chairman Mao, without the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we poor and lower-middle peasants would have nothing. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are good. He Luting, this poisonous snake, wants us to turn back, we resolutely do not agree! Zou Qun, Political Commissar of the Flying Brigade of a certain Air Force unit stationed in Shanghai, wrote an article titled "Long Live the Revolutionary Mass Movement," vehemently denouncing He Luting's fallacies. He said that He Luting, this extremely reactionary fellow, dared to audaciously attack Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment and wantonly slander the revolutionary mass movement, nonsensically saying that "'mass movement is not embroidery,' 'correcting a wrong must go too far,' these words themselves are wrong, are the root of creating 'leftism'." I want to resolutely refute his fallacies. All class enemies have always opposed the revolutionary mass movement. Now, relying on the revolutionary mass movement, we are ferreting out a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang members on all fronts. He Luting revealing his true colors in the bright daylight of socialism is also a victory of the revolutionary mass movement. We must carry out the revolutionary mass movement in depth, smash your conspiracy of these "authorities" and "patriarchs" to restore capitalism, and seize back the leadership that you have occupied for a long time. Let you never stand up again!
    Anti-Party and anti-socialist element He Luting attacked musical works that closely cooperate with the revolutionary struggle and express the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "crude shouts," as "only loud rumbling sounds"; nonsensically saying that revolutionary musical works are "written quickly, sung quickly, forgotten quickly, and discarded quickly." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers felt boundless indignation at He Luting's frenzied cursing of revolutionary music. They used their own experiences to jointly denounce He Luting's slander of revolutionary music. Zhang Tongyan and Yi Jiexang of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison Command, Liu Jianqiu of a certain Air Force unit stationed in Shanghai, and others pointed out that He Luting's cursing of revolutionary music exposed this counter-revolutionary element's deep-seated hatred for the Party, for socialism, and for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our People's Liberation Army will not spare this poisonous insect. They said that revolutionary songs are sung the fastest, spread the widest, and remembered the most firmly in the army, greatly inspiring our revolutionary fighting spirit. We sang songs such as "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention" and "The March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" to defeat Japanese imperialism and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang of eight million troops. We sang these songs to defeat the American wolf in Korea. Every time we sing "Chairman Mao's Soldiers Listen Most to the Party's Words," we are filled with enthusiasm and determined to listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be strong revolutionary soldiers. These songs have a strong fighting atmosphere, they reflect the thoughts and feelings of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, they write out the strongest voice of the era, and they sing out the aspirations of the revolutionary people of the proletariat. We must sing them generation after generation and always use them as the battle horns for the revolutionary people's heroic struggle and courageous advance.
    Chen Xiyuan, a worker at the Shanghai Dihua Instrument Factory who composed the revolutionary song "Listen to the Party's Words," said loudly at a recent gathering of amateur musicians of Shanghai workers, peasants, and soldiers to denounce He Luting: He Luting! You are not allowed to defame revolutionary songs! You are not allowed to talk nonsense! Your conspiracy to oppose Mao Zedong Thought by opposing revolutionary songs is a pipe dream! We amateur worker-peasant-soldier authors will never buy your "expert" and "authority" dog-head brand! Since 1960, under the inspiration of the revolutionary situation of the Great Leap Forward, following Chairman Mao's teachings, breaking superstitions, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have created many revolutionary songs, singing out the inner words of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The workers, peasants, and soldiers say it well: Singing revolutionary songs loudly, striving to be revolutionary people; singing Leap Forward songs, great leap forward in production. Revolutionary songs have a high prestige and strong vitality in the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must deprive you demons and monsters of your right to speak in the field of music, firmly establish the right to speak of the proletariat, write revolutionary songs, sing revolutionary songs, greatly enhance revolutionary aspirations, and carry the Great Cultural Revolution through to the end. Workers at the Gaoqiao Chemical Plant who performed "The Radiance of Mao Zedong's Works Shines" at the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, hearing that He Luting dared to viciously slander revolutionary songs, were furious. They immediately held a mass singing conference attended by more than 1,300 workers. They sang loudly more than 30 revolutionary songs such as "Great Country, Great Party," "Chairman Mao, We Will Always Follow You in Revolution," and "Carry the Great Cultural Revolution Through to the End," using revolutionary songs to counter the shameless slander of He Luting and his ilk.
    The Qixian Propaganda Team of the Qixian Brigade of the Fengxian County Qixian Commune, who participated in the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, said in a submission to the newspaper: We peasants love revolutionary music the most, and we also like to create and sing it ourselves. He Luting, you slander revolutionary songs as "forced together," "out of tune," and "chaotic and disorganized," not allowing us peasants to master musical weapons,妄想attempting to monopolize music as a tool for his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. We want to tell you frankly, music can never be monopolized by you bourgeois "authorities" and "patriarchs"; the peasant masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought have long mastered musical weapons, we want to create more and better revolutionary mass songs, sing out the strongest voice of socialism, and bury you in the ocean of revolutionary mass songs!
    The broad masses and cadres of Shanghai, and the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, also listed many facts exposing He Luting's crimes of peddling black goods and spreading bourgeois ideological poisons. In their letter to the editors of *Jiefang Daily* and *Wenhui Bao*, five comrades, Wan Li, Chen Lingqun, Zhang Bofan, Chao Zhijue, and Zhang Jielin, from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, pointed out: In the spring of 1962, after He Luting issued a series of anti-Party and anti-socialist black words, his creations closely followed suit. He dug out his black goods from the 1930s—five orchestral pieces full of the decadent atmosphere of the bourgeoisie, which he had composed for films and dramas in the past, carefully repaired them, and stuffed them into concerts. The Deng Tuo black gang used black words to curse our Party, to curse the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune; He Luting used black tunes to imply and compare, how closely they cooperated! Zhao Zongheng, a worker at the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant, angrily exposed the cunning conspiracy of He Luting in composing the poisonous song *The Song of the Red Fortress* for this plant. He said: In March 1964, I wrote a song lyric *The Song of the Red Fortress* with full enthusiasm. Soon He Luting composed the music for it. The melody was soft and spiritless, completely stifling the revolutionary content of the lyrics. Some comrades originally wanted to re-compose the music for *The Song of the Red Fortress*, but He Luting took advantage of his position and eagerly published it publicly. Comrades from the Dance Team No. 1 of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House exposed that when He Luting went to the opera house in 1964 to review the programs participating in the Fifth "Shanghai Spring," he was very indifferent to works reflecting the fiery struggle life and communist style of Shanghai workers, and picked on them in every way, saying that "the movements are too simple," "too crude," "not beautiful," "not lyrical," "rumbling, no artistry," but he greatly appreciated and greatly affirmed programs that served the bourgeoisie, such as flowers, birds, insects, and fish. Everyone, look how much he hates works reflecting workers, peasants, and soldiers, and how much he loves and supports things that spread bourgeois ideological sentiments! In a word, he wants literature and art to clear the way for the restoration of the bourgeoisie.
    The revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music further pointed out that for more than a decade, He Luting and his ilk have never relaxed their struggle with the proletariat for the leadership of musical education. In 1963, He Luting threw out a whole set of programmatic reactionary educational propositions,妄想attempting to turn our socialist school into a reactionary fortress serving the restoration of capitalism.
    In recent days, many teachers and students have also written big-character posters exposing and denouncing He Luting's crimes of妄想making young revolutionary music successors abandon Mao Zedong's educational and literary ideas and fall into the mire of bourgeois individualism and fame and fortune. Shen Xidi, Ding Zhinuo, and other four young teachers of the Orchestral Department wrote big-character posters exposing that anti-Party and anti-socialist element He Luting, using his usurped leading position, tried every means to win over and corrode young people,妄想attempting to organize forces for capitalist restoration. Tan Mizi and others from the Music Squad of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music wrote big-character posters warning He Luting: What you said, "It is impossible to cultivate a composer simply by experiencing life. If people who study instrumental performance often leave their business to go to the countryside to experience life, then the final result can only be 'changing careers'." These black words are a completely crazy attack on Chairman Mao's instructions that literary and art workers must go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers and must integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He Luting! You want to threaten us with "changing careers," to make us put down revolutionary literary and art weapons, to become your successors, to become bourgeois and revisionist "musicians," this is a pipe dream! We revolutionary teachers and students will engage in revolution for a lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Our firm revolutionary will cannot be threatened.
    After the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai heard that the revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music had exposed He Luting's reactionary true colors, this extremely stubborn anti-Party and anti-socialist element still dreamed of using the lie of "I am just talking about technology, I will not oppose the Party" to stubbornly resist and exonerate himself, arousing even greater anger. More and more workers, peasants, and soldiers wrote articles to newspapers and letters to the conservatory of music, strongly supporting the revolutionary actions of the teachers and students of the conservatory of music. They unanimously warned He Luting: Under the revolutionary demon-revealing mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, you cannot escape if you want to escape, and you cannot muddle through if you want to muddle through! There is much evidence of your opposition to the Party and your opposition to the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must thoroughly defeat you, we must thoroughly eradicate your anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the music field, and we must thoroughly smash your conspiracy to vigorously carry out capitalist restoration.

    上海工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    彻底揭发批判贺绿汀反党罪行
    据新华社上海十七日电　上海音乐学院万里等五同志揭发该院院长贺绿汀反党反社会主义罪行的来信，八日在上海各报登出后，群情愤慨，怒不可遏。这几天，上海广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子纷纷写文章，写大字报，举行声讨会，挥起毛泽东思想的“千钧棒”，狠狠痛打披着“老革命音乐家”、“共产党员”外衣，隐藏在党内的、音乐界反党反社会主义黑线的重要人物贺绿汀。他们严正指出：反党反社会主义分子贺绿汀，不管你资格多老，不管你地位多高，不管你潜在势力多深，在毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨之下，你妄图实现资本主义复辟的大阴谋，都是要被彻底揭穿的，都是要被彻底粉碎的。
    广大群众在极其愤怒的声讨声中，一致指出：窃踞上海音乐学院院长、中国音乐家协会副主席、中国音乐家协会上海分会主席等职位的贺绿汀，所干的一系列的反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当，是与国际上一切牛鬼蛇神的反华大合唱相呼应的；是与国内地富反坏右分子和三十年代的文艺“权威”、“祖师爷”的资本主义复辟活动紧密地配合的，和“三家村”黑帮是道道地地的一路货色。“三家村”黑帮用黑话、黑戏来诬蔑毛主席，反对党中央，攻击无产阶级专政；贺绿汀则用黑话、黑曲和“三家村”黑帮一唱一和，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。令人更气愤的是，贺绿汀叫嚣文艺批评“应当是养花而不是割草”，妄想只许他们一小撮资产阶级“专家”、“权威”到处放火放毒，不准一切革命者对他们进行批判，这同“三家村”黑帮叫喊的“多学少评”等谰言完全是一模一样，一鼻孔出气的。广大工农兵群众大声警告贺绿汀：你妄想搞资产阶级反革命专政，不许我们起来捍卫无产阶级专政，这是白日做梦！你攻击我们是“打手”，是“棍子”，对！你说对了！对于你们就是要实行专政，就是要打！用革命的“千钧棒”狠狠地把你们彻底打倒。
    上海杨树浦发电厂老工人姜林根说：看了反党反社会主义分子贺绿汀疯狂地、咬牙切齿地咒骂党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社“可以送入棺材”这种十分恶毒的谬论，真是气愤到极点。他列举了本厂的许多大跃进的事实以后说：我们工人就是喜欢大跃进。上海县华漕公社副社长张裕秀、黎明大队贫下中农协会副主席侯银弟说：贺绿汀这个反动家伙疯狂攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，完全是代表地富反坏右讲话。没有党和毛主席，没有总路线、大跃进和人民公社，就没有我们贫农下中农的一切。我们贫农下中农最深刻地体会到，总路线、大跃进、人民公社就是好。贺绿汀这条毒蛇，要我们走回头路，我们坚决不答应！驻沪空军某部飞行大队政委邹群以《革命的群众运动万岁》为题，著文痛斥贺绿汀的谬论。他说，贺绿汀这个反动透顶的家伙，竟敢放肆地攻击毛主席的英明论断，对革命的群众运动大肆诽谤，胡说什么“‘群众运动不是绣花’、‘矫枉必须过正’这些话本身就是错的，是造成‘左’的根子。”我要坚决驳斥他的谬论。一切阶级敌人从来都是反对革命的群众运动的。现在，我们依靠革命的群众运动正在把各个战线上一小撮反党反社会主义的黑帮分子揪出来。贺绿汀在社会主义的光天化日下现出原形，也正是革命的群众运动的胜利。我们一定要把革命的群众运动深入地搞下去，粉碎你们这些“权威”、“祖师爷”复辟资本主义的阴谋，夺回长期被你们霸占的领导权。让你们永世不得翻身！
    反党反社会主义分子贺绿汀攻击密切配合革命斗争、表现工农兵思想感情的音乐作品是“粗糙的叫喊”，是“只有轰隆轰隆的强烈音响”；胡说什么革命音乐作品“写得快、唱得快、忘得快、丢得快。”对贺绿汀这种丧心病狂地咒骂革命音乐的恶言，广大工农兵群众感到无比义愤。他们用切身的体会齐声讨伐贺绿汀对革命音乐的诬蔑。上海警备区某部张同言、易杰祥，驻沪空军某部刘剑秋等指出，贺绿汀咒骂革命音乐，正暴露了这个反革命分子对党、对社会主义、对工农兵有刻骨的仇恨，我们人民解放军是饶不了这条毒虫的。他们说，革命歌曲在部队里唱得最快，传得最广，记得也最牢，大大激励了我们的革命斗志。我们唱着《三大纪律八项注意》、《中国人民解放军进行曲》等歌曲，打败了日本帝国主义，消灭了蒋匪帮八百万军队。我们唱着这些歌在朝鲜打败了美国狼。每当我们唱起《毛主席的战士最听党的话》的时候，就热血沸腾，决心听党的话，听毛主席的话，做坚强的革命战士。这些歌曲具有浓厚的战斗气息，它反映了亿万工农兵的思想感情，写出了时代的最强音，唱出了无产阶级革命人民的心声，我们要一代一代唱下去，永远把它作为革命人民英勇奋斗、勇往直前的战斗号角。
    创作革命歌曲《听话要听党的话》的上海大华仪表厂工人陈锡元，在最近召开的上海工农兵群众业余音乐工作者声讨贺绿汀的集会上大声说：贺绿汀！不准你诋毁革命歌曲！不准你胡说八道！你阴谋用反对革命歌曲来反对毛泽东思想，是痴心梦想！我们工农兵业余作者绝不买你“专家”、“权威”狗头招牌的账！一九六○年以来，我们工农兵在大跃进革命形势鼓舞下，遵循毛主席的教导，破除迷信，创作了很多革命歌曲，唱出了工农兵的心里话。工农兵说得好：高唱革命歌，争做革命人；唱起跃进歌，生产大跃进。革命歌曲在工农兵生活中有崇高的威信，有强大的生命力。我们要剥夺你们这些牛鬼蛇神在音乐领域内的发言权，牢固地树立起无产阶级的发言权，大写革命歌曲，大唱革命歌曲，大长革命志气，把文化大革命进行到底。不久前在第七届“上海之春”音乐会上演出《毛主席著作闪金光》的高桥化工厂工人，听到贺绿汀竟敢恶毒诽谤革命歌曲，怒气冲天，他们立即举行了一个由一千三百多工人参加的群众歌咏大会，他们放声高歌，唱起了《伟大的国家伟大的党》，《毛主席，我们永远跟你干革命》，《将文化大革命进行到底》等三十几首革命歌曲，用革命歌声反击贺绿汀之流的无耻诬蔑。
    参加第七届“上海之春”音乐会的奉贤县齐贤公社齐贤大队宣传队在给报社的来稿中说：我伲农民最喜爱革命音乐，还喜欢自己动手创作，进行宣传演唱。贺绿汀，你诬蔑革命歌曲是“硬拼硬凑”、“哩哩啦啦”、“杂乱无章”，不准我们农民掌握音乐武器，妄想垄断音乐作为他反党反社会主义的工具。我伲要正告你，音
  乐决不是你们这些资产阶级“权威”、“祖师爷”所能垄断得了的；用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民群众，早已掌握了音乐武器，我伲要创作更多更好的革命群众歌曲，唱出社会主义的最强音，把你们葬身在革命群众歌曲的海洋里！
    上海广大群众和干部、上海音乐学院革命师生还列举许多事实揭露贺绿汀贩卖黑货，传播资产阶级思想毒素的罪行。上海音乐学院万里、陈聆群、张伯藩、巢志珏、张杰林等五同志给《解放日报》、《文汇报》编辑同志的来信中指出：一九六二年春天，贺绿汀在发出连篇反党反社会主义的黑话以后，创作也紧紧跟上。他从箱底里翻出了三十年代的黑货——当年他为电影、话剧配音的五首充满资产阶级腐朽气息的管弦乐曲，加以精心修补，塞进了音乐会。邓拓黑帮用黑话咒骂我们党，咒骂总路线、大跃进、人民公社；贺绿汀则用黑曲子含沙射影，隐喻比拟，配合得何等紧密！上海杨树浦发电厂工人赵宗恒愤怒揭露贺绿汀为这个厂谱的《红色堡垒之歌》这支毒曲的狡猾阴谋。他说：一九六四年三月，我满怀激情地写了一首歌词《红色堡垒之歌》，不久贺绿汀就给谱了曲。曲调配得软绵绵、灰溜溜的，完全扼杀了歌词的革命内容。本来有些同志想替《红色堡垒之歌》重新谱曲，可是贺绿汀却利用职权，迫不及待地把它公开发表了。上海实验歌剧院舞蹈一队同志揭发，贺绿汀一九六四年去该院审查参加第五届“上海之春”节目时，对于反映上海工人火热斗争生活和共产主义风格的作品，十分冷淡，百般挑剔，说什么“动作太简单”，“太粗糙”，“不优美”，“不抒情”，“轰隆轰隆，没有艺术性”，但是对表现花、鸟、虫、鱼之类为资产阶级服务的节目，却十分欣赏，兴趣很大，倍加肯定。大家看看，他对反映工农兵的作品多么仇视，对传播资产阶级思想情调的东西又是多么爱护、支持！一句话，他是要文艺为资产阶级复辟鸣锣开道。
    上海音乐学院革命师生还进一步指出，十几年来，贺绿汀之流从来没有放松过同无产阶级争夺音乐教育的领导权。一九六三年，贺绿汀抛出了一整套纲领性的反动教育主张，阴谋把我们社会主义的学校，办成为资本主义复辟效劳的反动堡垒。
    连日来，许多师生还纷纷写大字报揭露和痛斥贺绿汀妄图使年轻的革命音乐接班人抛弃毛泽东教育思想和文艺思想，陷到资产阶级个人主义名利思想的泥坑中去的罪行。管弦系沈西蒂、丁芷诺等四位青年教师写大字报揭发反党反社会主义分子贺绿汀，利用他窃踞的领导地位，千方百计地拉拢腐蚀青年，妄想为资本主义复辟组织力量。上海音乐学院音乐小队谭蜜子等写大字报正告贺绿汀：你说的什么“决不可能单纯地用体验生活的方法培养出一个作曲家来，学器乐演奏的人假如经常离开自己的业务下乡去体验生活的话，那么最后的结果只好是‘改行’完事”。这些黑话，完全是对毛主席关于文艺工作者必须深入工农兵、必须与工农兵相结合的指示的最疯狂的攻击。贺绿汀！你想以“改行”来威胁我们，要我们放下革命的文艺武器，成为你们的继承人，成为资产阶级、修正主义的“音乐家”，这是白日做梦！我们革命师生，要干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。我们坚定的革命意志是威胁不倒的。
    上海广大工农兵听到上海音乐学院革命师生揭发了贺绿汀的反动真面目以后，这个极为顽固的反党反社会主义分子还梦想用什么“我只是讲讲技术，不会反党”的谎言，负隅顽抗为自己开脱罪责，激起了更大的愤怒。越来越多的工农兵群众写文章给报社和写信给音乐学院，大力支持音乐学院师生的革命行动。他们一致警告贺绿汀：在毛泽东思想这一革命的照妖镜下，你想逃是逃不掉的，你想混也是混不过去的！反对党，反对伟大的毛泽东思想的许多罪证俱在。我们一定要彻底斗倒你，一定要把你在音乐界的反党反社会主义黑线彻底拔掉，一定要彻底粉碎你大搞资本主义复辟的阴谋。
