    Editor's note: The Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative is a good example of running socialist commerce according to Mao Zedong Thought and is an advanced banner in the national supply and marketing cooperative system. For twenty years, they have adhered to the socialist direction, adhered to the policy of "developing the economy, guaranteeing supply," wholeheartedly serving production, and serving the people's lives, closely uniting with the peasant masses, and making outstanding contributions to improving the mountainous area.
    To run socialist commerce well, it is necessary to highlight politics and adhere to class struggle as the key link, and the struggle between the two lines as the key link. On this fundamental issue, we must be very clear, very firm, and unambiguous. To learn from the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative is to learn from their unwavering adherence to the socialist road, constantly vigilance against and crushing the sabotage activities of class enemies, and constantly vigilance against and overcoming the encroachment of capitalist business ideology. In the storms of class struggle, never lose direction and always advance victoriously.
    The experience of the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative tells us that to run people's commerce well, we must establish a revolutionized commercial team armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This team must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's teachings, loyal to the Party, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the people. We must regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction for all actions and use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. We will do what Chairman Mao says; we will go wherever the Party points; we will wholeheartedly serve the people, wholeheartedly serve the revolution, be proactive, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work hard, and persevere to the end.
    Seriously running socialist commerce well in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought is greatly beneficial to consolidating the collective economy, developing agricultural production, supporting national construction, and improving the lives of commune members. Rural commercial workers across the country should learn from the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative and strive to create more advanced enterprises. With thousands upon thousands of Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the development of socialist construction in rural areas will be greatly promoted.
    In late spring and early summer, Zhaige is bustling everywhere in the fields. On both sides of the Shan Jiao River, known as the "Mule and Horse River," stout mules and horses are running, and herds of cattle and sheep are moving on the mountains. The mountain tops and river beaches are dotted with dense crowds of people, commune members with the lofty ambition to change the world, building river dams, planting medicinal materials, and planting trees to create forests. This Zhaige Commune, known for its diversified economy, is full of cheerful voices and vigorous energy.
    When commune cadres and members talk about the achievements in developing a diversified economy, they always count on their fingers the good things the supply and marketing cooperative has done for them: tens of thousands of mules, horses, cattle, and sheep have been developed with the help of the supply and marketing cooperative; trees all over the mountains and fields have been cultivated with the support of the supply and marketing cooperative; more than a dozen sideline businesses have been actively helped to open up by the supply and marketing cooperative...
    The comrades of the supply and marketing cooperative said: This is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's general policy of "developing the economy, guaranteeing supply."
    The fact is indeed the case. The comrades of the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative were nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought relatively early. Not long after the establishment of the cooperative in 1943, responsible comrades of the Taiyue Administrative Office who returned from Yan'an conveyed to them Chairman Mao's general policy of "developing the economy, guaranteeing supply." The staff also seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Get Organized!" and other articles in light of the actual situation at the time. Even now, they still preserve the selected readings of Chairman Mao's works reprinted by the Taiyue Military Region at that time. This book of Chairman Mao's works on mulberry paper is now old and yellowed, but you can still see the red lines drawn on important words and sentences by the staff during their studies more than twenty years ago. "Develop the economy, guarantee supply" has taken root in their minds and pointed out the direction for running the cooperative. For more than twenty years, they have been holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and constantly moving forward.
    Wherever the Party points, we will strike there
    Zhaige was originally a poor mountain gully, with steep stone mountains, bare loess cliffs, and deep gullies that seemed to have no end. The mountains produced very little, and grain yields were very low. Most of the people here were refugees from Henan and Hebei. After the nationwide liberation, many people carried their burdens and went down the mountain to return to their hometowns.
    Liu Rongsheng, secretary of the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative branch, saw this scene and was very upset. He thought: Zhaige's mountains are poor, but this is the glorious and great anti-Japanese base area. The Anti-Japanese War relied on the mountains, the War of Liberation also relied on the mountains, and now socialist construction must rely on this mountain. The mountain is our base for survival, growth, and victory. Not only can we not leave this mountain, but we must respond to the Party's call and make this mountainous area rich. I am a Communist Party member and manager of the supply and marketing cooperative, with such an important responsibility! We must work together with the poor brothers to make this mountainous area rich!
    At that time, the township Party branch analyzed that the biggest difficulty here was the lack of means of production, especially the lack of livestock. Plowing the land relied on people pulling, and grinding flour relied on people pushing. The Party branch decided to start by solving the lack of livestock to develop agricultural production and change the face of the mountainous area.
    Upon hearing the Party's instructions, Liu Rongsheng immediately led the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative to Henan to buy back four cattle and two horses. The cattle were quickly sold, but the horses could not be sold. It turned out that the peasants rumored that the water of the Shan Jiao River contained poisonous gas, and everyone was afraid to raise horses. Liu Rongsheng thought that the peasants believe in facts most, so he must find a leader to raise horses. He found Guo Yongniu, the township head at the time and a Communist Party member, and Zhang Furong, the vice chairman of the farmers' association at the time, and asked them to start raising horses first. These two mares were originally pregnant with foals. After careful feeding by Guo Yongniu and Zhang Furong, they both foaled after eight months. Guo Yongniu's foal also sold for forty shis of wheat. This news immediately caused a sensation in the large and small mountain villages along the Shan Jiao River.
    The supply and marketing cooperative seized this "living model" and publicized it vigorously. Every market day, the supply and marketing cooperative exhibited the mares and foals, letting them speak for themselves, which gradually aroused a high tide of demand for buying horses among the masses.
    The supply and marketing cooperative bought more and more horses for the masses. In order to self-breed and develop livestock, the vast majority were purchased mares. This raised the issue of mating. There was also a private stud horse in the area, but it cost eight dou of millet to mate once, and one shi of millet to credit. The masses reflected: We can afford to buy horses, but we can't afford to mate them. So the supply and marketing cooperative bought a stud horse, and Liu Rongsheng took the lead as a mating worker. Since then, the horse-raising industry has developed greatly.
    In 1949, there were only more than 400 livestock in the Zhaige area. By the end of 1965, more than 5,000 head of large livestock had been raised. Not only was the problem of animal power solved, but it also became a large livestock breeding base in southern Shanxi, capable of exporting livestock to other places. The masses gratefully said: The supply and marketing cooperative has helped us lay a rich foundation.
    With the problem of livestock solved, a diversified economy developed, and grain yields also increased. At this time, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called for the construction of 15 million mu of Dazhai fields and 15 million mu of irrigated land within the Third Five-Year Plan. The Zhaige Commune responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and decided to build 6,000 mu of Dazhai fields and 4,000 mu of irrigated land. The commune Party committee wanted the supply and marketing cooperative to assist in raising construction funds.
    A new page was about to be turned in Zhaige's agricultural production. Liu Rongsheng was so excited that he couldn't sleep. To have ten thousand mu of fertile land appear in such a mountain gully, what a big deal! He suggested to the commune and production team cadres: ask for funds from the small autumn harvest. As long as each production team provides two hundred laborers to fight hard for two months, they can get at least 20,000 yuan, which will be enough for the construction costs by the end of the year.
    This suggestion was warmly approved by the communes and teams, and a total of 300 laborers were allocated by the production teams. This team, led by Zhu Zhiyue, a member of the Party branch of the supply and marketing cooperative and an old salesman, ascended Hongao Mountain. The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative and the commune members worked together, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, cut brambles and chopped handles. Sure enough, they earned a total of 28,000 yuan in two months.
    Let the experience of the masses bloom all over the mountains
    The Zhaige Commune now has 850,000 economic forest trees, with Walnut Mountain, Pear Tree Gully, Pepper Garden, Apple Forest.... How were these forests developed? It turns out that the team led by Liu Rongsheng, wholeheartedly serving the masses, was always listening to the opinions and demands of the masses and learning from their good experiences, and then turning the experiences of the masses into new ideas to serve them.
    In 1947, Liu Rongsheng and old man Zhang Wenlin worked together and saw Zhang Wenlin carefully cultivating a sapling. He asked and learned that it was a walnut sapling. Liu Rongsheng was extremely happy to hear that it was a walnut tree. Although there were a few walnut trees in this mountain gully, they used to belong to landlords and rich peasants, and the poor and lower-middle peasants didn't dare to touch a single walnut. Landlords and rich peasants also used superstition to scare people, saying that those who planted walnut trees would have a short life. Therefore, although walnuts were "money trees," no one dared to plant them. Seeing this walnut sapling, Liu Rongsheng thought of a future walnut forest all over the mountains and fields, letting this "money tree" benefit the poor brothers. He carried a bag of walnut seeds to Li Fenghua, the director of the township women's federation at the time, and asked her to lead women with new ideas to plant walnuts. The first batch of walnut trees were planted and grew very well. After the nationwide liberation, walnut trees were planted on a larger scale. Now there are more than 390,000 walnut trees in the whole commune, making it the most profitable economic forest tree in the area. Li Fenghua has also become a famous model for planting trees and creating forests in the area. She always says: "Liu Rongsheng is my teacher."
    In 1957, the father of Song Guangxing, an old poor peasant in Mutan Gully, was sick and wanted to eat pears. He spent a few jiao to buy two, but couldn't bite them. Ma Ximing from the supply and marketing cooperative went to see him, and the old man said excitedly: "We have so many wild pear trees on our mountains. Why doesn't the supply and marketing cooperative help us graft pear trees?" Ma Ximing brought the old poor peasant's opinion back to the supply and marketing cooperative. Everyone believed that this represented the demands of the masses. Ma Ximing immediately set out, braving the heavy rain, to transport branches of the famous "Half-Kilo Crisp" pear from Wanrong County. Pear trees began to be grafted on a large scale. Up to now, more than 5,000 pear trees have grown in the long Pear Tree Gully of Houzhai Brigade alone, and there are more than 20,000 pear trees in the whole commune. The wishes of Old Man Song and the wishes of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been realized.
    There are many crabapple trees in the Guanyin Temple area. The Linfen Orchard entrusts the supply and marketing cooperative every year to purchase crabapple seeds to cultivate seedlings and graft apples. Some commune members said: We have ready-made crabapple trees, why can't we graft apple trees? After hearing this opinion, the supply and marketing cooperative began in 1957 to send a large number of apple tree branches to the commune members. As a result, crabapple trees were gradually transformed into apple trees.
    In the past, few people in Zhaige planted pepper trees because the pepper seeds have oil and are difficult to germinate. Cui Lianzhong of Tanjia Gully first wrapped the pepper seeds in cloth and put them in the toilet to soak and remove the oil. After planting them in this way, pepper seedlings emerged. In 1959, Liu Rongsheng went to Tanjia Gully. He was attracted by Cui Lianzhong's more than one fen of pepper seedlings. He sincerely asked Cui Lianzhong for advice, learned how to plant pepper trees, and immediately promoted it among the masses. Pepper Gully appeared in Tanjia Gully. Pepper gardens appeared in other brigades. Commune members also planted sporadic pepper trees in their yards. In a few years, more than 20,000 pepper trees grew.
    Anxious about what the masses are anxious about, worried about what the masses are worried about
    As the saying goes: The weather is unpredictable. Agricultural production is bound to suffer various disasters. In times of disaster, the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative always appears in front of the masses in time to help production teams overcome difficulties.
    Last May, wheat was spitting ears and flowering, growing exceptionally well. One day, someone from the Bamu Brigade came urgently to say that 300 mu of wheat had jaundice. This startled the people of the supply and marketing cooperative. There is a saying in the area: Jaundice appears, and the yield is reduced by half, so it must be treated quickly. However, the sodium sulfanilate for treating jaundice in the supply and marketing cooperative was sold out. To transport it to the county town, it was already getting dark. The mountain road from Zhaige to the county town is seventy li, passing through the so-called "forty li of uninhabited land" of the Forty Li Ridge, and the road is difficult to walk. Deputy Director Ma Ximing wrung his hands anxiously. At this time, Yang Mingyi, who had transferred from the army to the supply and marketing cooperative, requested to go to the city overnight to buy medicine. In such an emergency, Ma Ximing had no choice but to agree, and at the same time, he asked salesman Guo Shibiao to go with him. The two rode their bicycles down the mountain at full speed, and it was dark when they reached Forty Li Ridge. On both sides of Forty Li Ridge are deep gullies and mountains. If you are not careful, you risk falling into the gully. The two insisted on climbing the mountain in the dark. By the time they reached the county town, it was already midnight. The next day, as soon as it dawned, they brought pesticides and hurried back in the drizzle, arriving at the supply and marketing cooperative at ten o'clock. The pesticides were quickly sent to the Bamu Brigade, and the jaundice was cured.
    In the autumn of 1964, the kiln of the Yangjialing Production Team collapsed, killing ten cattle. It was such a serious loss that a production team with only eight commune members killed ten cattle at once! Li Zhenyu, the person in charge of the Tancun distribution point, rushed there quickly, and Liu Rongsheng also arrived soon. When the cadres and commune members saw the people from the supply and marketing cooperative arriving at this time, they shed tears as if they had met their relatives. Liu Rongsheng said: "Don't be afraid. When Dazhai's land was washed away by floods and houses collapsed, Chen Yonggui said, as long as there are people, we are not afraid. We have only lost a few cattle, which is much less difficult than them. As long as everyone works together, the supply and marketing cooperative will guarantee to help you buy the cattle back." It was decided on the spot that the supply and marketing cooperative would purchase all the dead cattle. Li Zhenyu helped the production team organize the commune members to cut grass, chop rafters, and transport them. Soon, the money from selling the dead cattle and the income from sideline businesses bought back six cattle. With the addition of two cattle from state relief and two cattle supported by other teams, the Yangjialing Production Team quickly had ten cattle again, which did not affect the autumn plowing and wheat planting at all.
    Advancing in the struggle of two ideologies
    The Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative's vigorous support for agricultural and sideline production has advanced in the continuous ideological struggle within.
    The Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative has an abacus that has been preserved for more than 20 years. This was confiscated from the local tyrant Gai Rurong by local farmers in the anti-traitor and liquidation movement in 1944. Old poor peasant Li Yongxiang handed the abacus to the supply and marketing cooperative, saying meaningfully: "In the past, Gai Rurong used it to beat us so we couldn't lift our heads or breathe. Now I hand it over to you, so you can carefully plan for our poor brothers!" Liu Rongsheng and other leaders often used this abacus and the old poor peasant's words to spur themselves and educate the staff. They often check whether they are truly "planning for the poor brothers" in their business activities and constantly fight against the simple profit-seeking view.
    In the summer of 1963, an agricultural and pastoral farm run by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture here was abolished. It left a horse and a donkey, which were originally to be sold to the production team. Because they were relatively weak and pregnant, they could not be used for a while. The supply and marketing cooperative spent 1,500 yuan to buy them and temporarily feed them. Soon, both animals foaled, and they grew very well. People who came from other places to buy livestock were willing to pay 3,000 yuan just for these two foals. Some people in the supply and marketing cooperative were happy to earn a sum of money.
    When the deal was about to be concluded, the Party branch held a meeting to specifically discuss the deal. Comrades criticized the leadership: What kind of abacus is this playing? Li Zhenyu, a member of the branch committee, pointed out that this was precisely the capitalist business ideology at work. He asked: "What is the difference between what a socialist supply and marketing cooperative does and what livestock dealers in the old society do?"
    Li Zhenyu's pointed words reminded the comrades. Everyone discovered that they had reached the edge of capitalist business, and they couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. The supply and marketing cooperative rejected the deal and sold the four animals to the production team at the original price plus the cost of feeding the fodder, a total of more than 1,700 yuan. The supply and marketing cooperative did not earn this money, but it gained a valuable lesson that no amount of money could buy: we must always be vigilant against the encroachment of capitalist business ideology and not let go of any of its sprouts.
    When the supply and marketing cooperative was buying livestock for the masses, some people also said: "Selling hairy insects will surely lead to poverty," and the supply and marketing cooperative would have to lose money. When the supply and marketing cooperative helped the masses plant trees and create forests, some people also said that it was a matter for the forestry department, and the supply and marketing cooperative could ignore it. After discussion, these ideas were criticized, and the understanding was unified. Only then did the supply and marketing cooperative help the masses buy livestock and plant trees.
    Through more than 20 years of practice and repeated ideological struggles, the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative has developed and enriched the words that Li Yongxiang said that year. That is, first calculate the big picture, then calculate the small picture; first calculate the political picture, then calculate the economic picture. We must stand on the position of the proletariat and first calculate whether it is beneficial to the country, the collective, and the masses. The business accounts of the supply and marketing cooperative must of course be calculated, but they cannot be calculated solely from the perspective of losing money or making money.
    Be the "intimate persons" of the poor and lower-middle peasants
    The comrades of the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative also pay great attention to serving the lives of the masses.
    In the Zhaige area, the masses live very scattered. More than 7,000 people live scattered in 324 mountain villages, which are distributed in the mountainside and bottom of the gully within a radius of 250 li. The large villages only have 50 households, and there are 120 villages with only one household. Liu Rongsheng and some old comrades have always insisted on carrying goods to every village and every household, and have educated and motivated more people to carry more shoulder poles and carry more goods. They not only deliver goods to the door to facilitate the masses, but also care for the lives of the masses in many ways and solve various difficulties.
    Old salesman Zhang Shugui walks from village to village every day. In addition to delivering goods and purchasing goods, he has also done many good things for the masses. Hearing that Zhang Changmin, a cattle worker and poor peasant in Pangjia Gully, had not put on cotton clothes in October due to the small number of people in his family, he was concerned about this matter. He got up in the middle of the night, braved the biting cold wind, and delivered cotton clothes to Zhang Changmin, so that he would not be cold when he went up the mountain to herd cattle.
    Salesman Ma Zhanfang saw that the sheep workers did not have umbrellas when herding sheep. He braved the rain to buy umbrellas in Qinshui County, traveling back and forth a hundred li on foot, and brought the umbrellas back to the sheep workers.
    Saleswoman Yang Fengling, known by the masses as the "Iron Girl," heard that Ren Shankui's house had caught fire and burned the quilts. She rushed to Ren Shankui's house early in the morning. Ren Shankui's mother was old and had poor eyesight and could not sew quilts well. She helped the old woman buy cloth, weighed cotton, and made cotton quilts together with saleswoman Gai Xiuying, sewing them neatly and sending them to her. Ren Shankui's old mother took Yang Fengling's hand and said: "You are closer than my own daughter!"
    In the past two years, they have been helping the masses solve a bigger problem in their lives - housing. The cave dwellings in Zhaige are prone to collapse and are relatively humid, which is one of the reasons for the prevalence of Kashin-Beck disease in the area. The supply and marketing cooperative helped the production team build seven brick kilns and designed cheap green brick thatched houses. Now more than 600 such new houses have been built in the whole commune. These houses are well ventilated and bright, with sunshine all over the ground, which has improved the living conditions of the masses and is very popular among the masses.
    Through more than 20 years of life and combat tests, the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative has formed a close flesh-and-blood relationship with the local masses.

    彻底为生产服务　完全为群众服务
    山西浮山县寨圪?供销社按照毛主席关于“发展经济，保障供给”的教导，支持生产队发展多种经营
    编者按：寨圪?供销社是按照毛泽东思想办社会主义商业的一个好典型，是全国供销合作社系统的一面先进旗帜。他们二十年如一日，坚持社会主义方向，坚持“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，全心全意为生产服务、为人民生活服务，同农民群众紧紧地团结在一起，为改善山区面貌作出了卓越的贡献。
    要办好社会主义商业，必须突出政治，坚持以阶级斗争为纲，以两条道路斗争为纲。在这个根本问题上，必须十分明确，十分坚定，毫不含糊。学习寨圪?供销社，就是要学习他们坚定不移地走社会主义道路，时时警惕和粉碎阶级敌人的破坏活动，时时警惕和战胜资本主义经营思想的侵袭。在阶级斗争的风浪中，永远不迷失方向，永远胜利前进。
    寨圪?供销社的经验告诉我们，要办好人民商业，必须建立一支以毛泽东思想武装起来的革命化的商业队伍。这支队伍要无限忠于毛主席的教导，忠于党，忠于祖国，忠于人民。要把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做；党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里；一心为人民，一心为革命，积极主动，戒骄戒躁，艰苦奋斗，坚持到底。
    按照毛泽东思想，认真办好社会主义商业，大大有利于巩固集体经济，发展农业生产，支援国家建设，改善社员生活。全国农村商业工作者，应该向寨圪?供销社学习，努力创造更多的先进企业。有了成千上万个寨圪?供销社，就会大大促进农村社会主义建设的发展。
    春末夏初的寨圪?，田野上到处显得很活跃。被人称为“骡马河”的山交河两岸，肥壮的骡马在奔跑，成群的牛羊在山上游动。山顶河滩都散布着密密麻麻的人群，那是胸怀改天换地壮志的社员们在修河坝、种药材、植树造林。这个以多种经营著称的寨圪?公社，到处是人欢马叫，热气腾腾。
    公社的干部和社员在谈到发展多种经营成绩的时候，总是扳着指头告诉你供销社给他们办的一宗宗好事：成千上万的骡马牛羊是供销社帮助发展起来的；满山遍野的树木是在供销社支援下培植起来的；十几项副业门路是供销社积极帮助开辟的……。
    供销社的同志们却说：这是贯彻执行毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针的结果。
    事实也的确是这样。寨圪?供销社的同志们受毛泽东思想的抚育是比较早的。在一九四三年建社之后不久，从延安回来的太岳行署负责同志就给他们传达过毛主席的“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针。职工们还结合当时的实际，认真地学习过毛主席的《组织起来》等文章。直到现在，他们还保存着当时太岳军区翻印的毛主席著作选读本。这本桑皮纸的毛主席著作现在已经旧得发黄了，但是还可以看到二十多年前职工们学习时，在重要的字句上划的红道道。“发展经济，保障供给”，在他们的思想里扎下了根，给他们指明了办社的方向。二十几年来，他们一直高举毛泽东思想红旗，不断前进。
    党指向哪里，就打到哪里
    寨圪?本来是个穷山沟，陡峭的石头山，光光的黄土崖，夹着一条条望不到头的深沟。山上出产很少，粮食产量很低，这里的人多半是从河南、河北逃荒来的。全国解放之后，许多人又挑着担子下山回乡了。
    寨圪?供销社支部书记刘荣升看到这种情景，脑子里翻腾得很厉害。他想：寨圪?的山是穷，可这是光荣伟大的抗日根据地。抗日战争靠的是山，解放战争也靠的是山，现在搞社会主义建设还得靠这个山。山是我们生存、成长、胜利的基地，不但不能离开这个山，而且要响应党的号召，把这个山区变富。自己是一个共产党员、供销社经理，负有多么重要的责任啊！一定要和穷哥儿们一起，把这个山区变富！
    当时的乡党支部分析，这里最大的困难是生产资料缺乏，特别是缺牲畜，犁地靠人拉，磨面靠人推。党支部决定从解决缺乏牲畜问题着手，来发展农业生产，改变山区面貌。
    刘荣升听到党的指示，立即带领供销社职工到河南去买回来四头牛、两匹马。牛很快卖出去了，马却卖不出去。原来农民传说山交河水有毒气，大家都不敢养马。刘荣升想，农民最相信事实，一定要找个养马的带头人。他找到当时的乡长、共产党员郭永牛和当时的农会副主席张富荣，请他们先养起马来。这两匹母马原来都怀着驹。经过郭永牛和张富荣的精心饲养，八个月后都收下了马驹。郭永牛的马驹还卖了四十石麦子。这新闻一下哄动了山交河畔大小山村。
    供销社抓住这个“活样板”，大张旗鼓地宣传。每逢集日，供销社把母马和马驹展出，让它们现身说法，这样在群众中逐渐掀起了要求买马的高潮。
    供销社给群众买来的马越来越多。为了自繁自养，发展牲畜，绝大多数都是买的母马。这就发生一个配种问题。当地也有个私人养种马，但是配一次种要八斗小米，赊账要一石。群众反映：买得起马，配不起种。于是供销社买来种马，刘荣升带头当配种员。从此，养马事业大发展起来。
    一九四九年，寨圪?地区只有四百多头牲畜，到一九六五年底已饲养了五千多头大牲畜，不但畜力问题解决了，而且成为晋南的一个大牲畜繁殖基地，能够向外地输送牲畜了。群众感激地说：供销社帮我们扎下了富根。
    牲畜问题解决了，多种经营发展起来了，粮食产量也提高了。正在这时候，中共山西省委号召在第三个五年计划内，修建一千五百万亩大寨田和一千五百万亩水浇地。寨圪?公社响应省委号召，决定修建六千亩大寨田，四千亩水浇地。公社党委要供销社协助筹措建设资金。
    寨圪?的农业生产要掀开新的一页。刘荣升兴奋得睡不着觉。就是在这样的山沟里，要出现万亩良田，这是多么大的事呀！他向公社和生产队的干部们建议：向小秋收要资金。只要各生产队拿出两百个劳力，大战两个月，至少可以拿到两万元，到年底的施工费用就足够了。
    这个建议得到了社队的热烈赞同，各生产队共拨出三百个劳力。这个队伍由供销社党支部委员、老营业员朱志跃带领，登上了红凹山。供销社的职工和社员们一同劳动，一同学习毛主席著作，以愚公移山精神，割荆条，砍柄把，果然在两个月内共获得两万八千元的收入。
    让群众的经验满山开花
    寨圪?公社现在有八十五万株经济林木，有了核桃山、梨树沟、花椒园、苹果林……。这些林木是怎样发展起来的呢？原来，刘荣升带领的这支忠心耿耿为群众服务的队伍，随时随地都在倾听群众的意见和要求，学习群众的好经验，然后把群众的经验变成这样那样的新点子，去为群众服务。
    一九四七年，刘荣升和张文林老汉一起劳动，看到张文林在小心翼翼地培植一棵幼苗。一问，才知道是核桃树苗。刘荣升一听是核桃树，高兴极了。核桃树在这个山沟里虽然有几棵，可是，从前都是地主富农的，贫雇农休想动他们一个核桃。地主富农还用迷信吓唬人，说什么种核桃的人会短寿。所以，核桃尽管是“摇钱树”，大家都不敢种。刘荣升看到这棵核桃树苗，就想到将来满山遍野的核桃林，让这种“摇钱树”为穷哥们造福。他背着一袋核桃种去找当时的乡妇联主任李凤花，请她带动有新思想的妇女们种核桃。第一批核桃树种起来了，长得很好。全国解放后，核桃树更大批地种植起来，现在全公社有三十九万多株核桃树，成了当地收益最大的经济林木，李凤花也成了当地著名的植树造林模范。她总是说：“刘荣升是我的老师。”
    一九五七年，木炭沟老贫农宋广兴的父亲病了，想吃梨子，花了几角钱买了两个，却咬不动。供销社的马锡铭去看他，老汉激动地说：“咱们山上有那么多杜梨树，供销社为甚么不帮助咱们嫁接梨树呢？”马锡铭把老贫农的意见带回供销社。大家认为这代表了群众的要求。马锡铭立刻出动，冒着大雨，从万荣县运来有名的“半斤酥”梨的树枝。梨树开始大规模嫁接起来。到现在，光是侯寨大队的那条长长的梨树沟里就长起了五千多株梨树，全公社共有两万多株。宋老汉的愿望、广大贫下中农的愿望实现了。
    观音庙一带有很多林檎树，临汾的果树场每年都委托供销社收购林檎树籽，去培育树苗，嫁接苹果。有的社员说：我们有现成的林檎树，为甚么就不能嫁接苹果树呢？供销社听到这种意见，从一九五七年开始，就把大量的苹果树枝，送到社员手里。于是，一棵棵的林檎树，就逐渐地变成了苹果树。
    寨圪?过去很少有人种花椒树，因为花椒籽上有油脂，很难发芽。谭家沟的崔连中先把花椒籽用布包起来，放到厕所里去浸沤去油，这样种上后，花椒树苗出来了。一九五九年，刘荣升到了谭家沟，他被崔连中那一分多地的花椒树苗吸引住了。他诚恳地向崔连中请教，学会了种花椒树的办法，马上在群众中宣传推广。谭家沟出现了花椒沟。其他大队里出现了花椒园。社员们的院子里也种上了零星的花椒树。几年之间，两万多株花椒树长出来了。
    急群众之急，忧群众之忧
    俗话说：天有不测风云。农业生产免不了要遭受种种灾害。在遇灾的时候，寨圪?供销社总是及时地出现在群众的面前，帮助生产队排除困难。
    去年五月，小麦正吐穗扬花，长得分外好。有一天，八亩大队来人告急说，有三百亩小麦生了黄疸病。这使供销社的人吃了一惊。当地有一句话：现了黄疸，减产一半，非得赶紧治不可。可是，供销社存的治黄疸病的磺酸钠偏偏卖完了。到县城里去运吧，天已经快黑了。从寨圪?到县城是七十里的山路，要经过所谓“四十里地无人烟”的四十里岭，路不好走。副主任马锡铭急得直搓手。这时，从部队转业来到供销社的杨明义，请求让他连夜进城买药。在这样紧急关头，马锡铭只好答应了他，同时，还让营业员郭士标和他一起去。他俩骑上自行车飞奔下山，到了四十里岭天就黑了。四十里岭两旁是深沟大山，一不小心，就有跌下沟去的危险。两人坚持摸黑爬山。当他们摸到县城时，已经是半夜。第二天，天刚发白，他们又带着农药，冒着蒙蒙细雨往回急赶，十点钟就赶回供销社。农药飞快地送到八亩大队，黄疸病被治住了。
    一九六四年秋天，杨家岭生产队的窑塌了，砸死了十头牛。一个只有八户社员的生产队一下砸死了十头牛，是多么严重的损失啊！谭村分销店的负责人李振玉飞快地赶到了，刘荣升不久也赶到了。干部和社员们，看到供销社的人在这个时候来到了，象见到了亲人一样，簌簌地流下了眼泪。刘荣升说：“不怕，大寨被大水冲走了地，塌了房子，陈永贵说，只要有人就不怕。咱们死了几头牛，比起人家来困难小多了，只要大伙齐心干，供销社保证帮助你们把牛买回来。”当场决定，供销社把死牛全部收购下来。李振玉帮助生产队把社员们组织起来，割草、砍木椽、搞运输。不久，卖死牛的钱和副业收入，买回了六头牛。加上国家救济两头，其他队支援了两头，杨家岭生产队很快又有了十头牛，一点也没有影响秋耕和种麦。
    在两种思想的斗争中前进
    寨圪?供销社大力支持农副业生产，是在内部不断进行思想斗争中前进的。
    寨圪?供销社有一架保存了二十多年的算盘。这是一九四四年当地农民在反奸清算运动中，从恶霸盖如荣那里没收来的。老贫农李永祥把算盘交给了供销社，意味深长地说：“过去盖如荣用它打得咱抬不起头，喘不过气，这会把它交给你们，好好替咱穷哥儿们打算吧！”刘荣升等领导人，常常用这架算盘和老贫农的这句话，鞭策自己，教育职工。经常检查在经营活动中是不是真正为“穷哥儿们打算”了，随时与单纯的赢利观点作斗争。
    一九六三年夏天，山西省农业厅在这里办的一个农牧场撤销了，剩下一匹马和一头驴，本来是要卖给生产队的，因为比较瘦弱，又怀着驹，一时不能使用，由供销社花一千五百元买了下来，代为暂时喂养。不久，两个牲口都下了驹，而且长得很好。从外地来买牲口的人，光是这两个驹子就愿意出三千元。供销社的一些人为了能赚一笔钱而高兴。
    当买卖快要成交的时候，党支部召开会议，专门讨论了这笔买卖。同志们对领导提出了批评：这到底是打的什么算盘？支部委员李振玉指出，这正是资本主义经营思想在作祟。他问道：“社会主义的供销社这样做，跟旧社会的牲口贩子有什么区别？”
    李振玉这一针见血的话，提醒了同志们。大家发现已经走到资本主义经营的边缘了，不由得出了一身冷汗。供销社回绝了这笔买卖，把四头牲口，按原价加上喂养的草料费，共一千七百多元，卖给了生产队。供销社没有赚这笔钱，但是得到了花多少钱也买不到的宝贵的教训：时刻要警惕着资本主义经营思想的侵袭，对它的任何一点苗头也不要放过。
    当供销社为群众买牲畜时，也曾有人说：“贩毛虫必定穷”，供销社非赔本不可。当供销社帮助群众植树造林的时候，也曾有人说，那是林业部门的事，供销社可以不管。经过讨论，对这些思想进行了批判，统一了认识，供销社才帮助群众买起牲畜，种起树来。
    寨圪?供销社经过二十多年的实践，经过反复的思想斗争，把当年李永祥说的那句话发展了，丰富了。那就是，先算大账，后算小账；先算政治账，后算经济账。要站在无产阶级的立场上，先算对国家、对集体、对群众有利无利的这本大账。供销社的营业账，当然也要算，但不能光是从赔钱赚钱上来算。
    做贫下中农的“贴心人”
    寨圪?供销社的同志也十分注意为群众生活服务。
    在寨圪?地区，群众居住非常分散，七千多口人散居在三百二十四个山庄里，这些山庄又分布在方圆二百五十里内的山腰和沟底。大庄只有五十户，一户一庄的倒有一百二十个。刘荣升和一些老同志，始终坚持担挑子为每庄每户送货，并且教育和带动更多的人，担起更多的扁担，担上更多的货物。他们不只是送货上门，方便群众，而且从多方面无微不至地关心群众生活，解决各种困难。
    老营业员张树贵，天天走庄串户，除去送货收购，还给群众办了很多好事。听说庞家沟牛工、贫农张长敏，由于家里人手少，十月还没有穿上棉衣，他惦着这事，半夜起来，冒着刺骨寒风，把棉衣送到张长敏手里，让他上山放牛不会挨冻。
    营业员马占芳，看见羊工放羊没有雨伞，他冒雨到沁水县城买雨伞，一天往返，步行百里，把伞买回来，送到羊工们手里。
    被群众称为“铁姑娘”的营业员杨凤玲，听说任善魁家失了火，烧了被子，一大早就赶到任善魁家。任善魁的母亲年老眼花，缝不好被子。她就帮助这位老婆婆买好布，称好棉花，和营业员盖秀英一起给做成棉被，缝得平平整整地给送了去。任善魁老母亲拉着杨凤玲的手说：“你比我的亲闺女还亲！”
    最近两年，他们正在帮助群众解决一个更大的生活问题——住房问题。寨圪?这个地方的窑洞容易坍塌，窑洞又比较潮湿，是当地流行大骨节病的原因之一。供销社帮助生产队建立起七座砖窑，设计了造价便宜的青砖茅草房屋。现在全公社已盖起了六百多间这样的新房，这些房子通风敞亮，阳光满地，改善了群众的居住条件，很受群众欢迎。
    经过二十多年来生活和战斗的考验，寨圪?供销社就这样和当地群众结成了血肉相联的情谊。
