    Eating the Food of the Laboring People
    Doing Counter-Party and Anti-People Bad Deeds
    I forced myself to watch the film "Sailing Against the Wind." After watching it, I felt really angry and indignant, and I can't help but stand up and ask the screenwriters and directors of the film, on whose class stand are you standing, and for whom are you singing praises?
    In the howling wind and flying sand of the march, the enemy's deputy division commander, who was captured by our army, lay on the ground pretending to be sick and refused to move in order to slow down our army's advance. Not only did the political instructor not see through the enemy's plot, but he also ordered the soldiers to prepare a stretcher and carry this fellow. Our soldiers hadn't eaten yet, but they first brought rice to the prisoner. But while eating, the prisoner still complained. Facing this bunch of extremely reactionary Kuomintang bandits, our army's political instructor did not severely reprimand them, but instead expressed deep sympathy, saying: "I know you are used to enjoying yourselves... We are also trying to improve your living conditions!" Sure enough, after a while, the medic found eggs from the homes of the common people and brought egg drop soup to the enemy.
    I want to ask: Are these guys prisoners of war, or are they officials? Are they enemies, or are they our comrades? Are our soldiers the sons and daughters of the people, or are they the mercenaries of these reactionary bandits? Is our army's political instructor a political worker of the people's army, or is he the quartermaster of these reactionary bandits?
    Screenwriters and directors, why did you arrange these plots in the film? Why do you want to slander our army's commanders and fighters? Why do you want to wantonly depict our army's policy towards prisoners of war as not distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves? Why do you portray the enemy as so resourceful and brave, so staunch and unyielding, while portraying our army's commanders and fighters as so stupid and incompetent? Why all this? You bunch of bad eggs, you eat the food of the laboring people, but you do the dirty work of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. You shoot black guns and release poisonous arrows at the Party and the people. The working class will never agree to you doing this. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and fight you demons and monsters to the end.

    吃劳动人民的粮食
    干反党反人民坏事
    我硬着头皮看完了影片《逆风千里》。看后叫我实在生气，实在愤慨，不能不站出来问一问影片的编导者们，你们是站在什么阶级立场上，为谁唱颂歌？
    在狂风怒号、飞沙走石的行军途中，被我军俘虏的敌军副师长为了拖住我军前进的速度，竟躺在地上装病不走。连指导员不但没有看穿敌人的阴谋，反而命令战士给他准备担架，抬着这个家伙走。我们的战士还没有吃饭，却先给俘虏送来了大米饭。可是俘虏一面吃，一面还发牢骚。我军指导员面对着这帮反动透顶的国民党匪徒，不是严厉的斥责，却是寄予深厚同情地说：“我知道你们享福惯了……我们也在想办法给你们改善生活嘛！”果真不假，过了不一会儿，卫生员就从老百姓家找来了鸡蛋，给敌人端来了鸡蛋汤。
    我要问：这些家伙是俘虏，还是官老爷？是敌人，还是我们的同志？我们的战士，是人民的子弟兵，还是这些反动匪徒的雇佣兵？我军的指导员是人民军队的政治工作人员，还是这些反动匪徒的勤务官？
    编导先生们，你们为什么要在影片里安排这些情节？为什么要污蔑我军的指战员？为什么要把我军对待俘虏的政策肆意描写成敌我不分？为什么把敌人描绘成那样的机智勇敢，坚贞不屈，而把我军指战员描绘成那样的愚蠢无能？这一切一切，都是为什么？你们这批坏蛋，吃的是劳动人民的粮食，干的却是反党反社会主义的勾当，你们向党和人民投黑枪，放毒箭。你们这样做，我们工人阶级坚决不答应。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，和你们这批牛鬼蛇神斗争到底。
