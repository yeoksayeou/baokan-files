　　Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, 8th. Tanzanian Minister of Rural Development and National Culture, Mgonja, praised Chairman Mao Zedong here on the evening of the 7th as the great leader of the Chinese revolution. He also said: "China is the true hope for all oppressed people in the world today. The hope of newly liberated countries rests on the great nation—China."
　　The Tanzanian minister made these remarks at a reception held by Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, He Ying, for the Tanzanian cultural, educational, and trade union delegation after their friendly visit to China.
　　He pointed out that China is using its culture as a weapon against imperialist aggression and subversion. He said that Tanzania will also use its culture as a powerful weapon against imperialist aggression.
　　He said that the friendship between Tanzania and China is based on mutual respect for sovereignty. Prior to this, Ambassador He Ying said in his speech that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, China is currently carrying out the Socialist Cultural Revolution and achieving great victories in this revolution. He also pointed out that the successful visit to China by the three Tanzanian delegations has strengthened the friendship between the two countries.
　　The reception was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Members of the three Tanzanian delegations attended the reception.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, 8th. Ruwegasira, head of the delegation of the National Union of Tanganyika Workers, who recently visited China, told Xinhua reporters here on the 8th about his impressions of his visit to China: "The Chinese people, young and old, are very enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works." "We were deeply moved by their political consciousness and their love for Chairman Mao's works."
　　He praised the policy of self-reliance put forward by Chairman Mao. He said that in China, "you can see that everyone, whether they are workers in factories, peasants in people's communes, or staff members of institutions, knows that building the country depends on themselves and not on others. This greatly contributes to the development of China's economy, new technologies, and cultural revolution. After the revisionists attempted to sabotage China's construction, the Chinese people relied entirely on themselves, and they have already achieved such great achievements."
　　He continued: "This teaches a lesson to other developing countries. Our country also has enemies who attempt to undermine our country. We must defend our independence and sovereignty and avoid the scourge of imperialist conspiracies. We also need to adopt a policy of self-reliance."
　　He also pointed out that the Chinese people study Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm. Under Chairman Mao's teachings on continuous revolution, the Chinese people, although they have made great achievements, still work hard to achieve even greater achievements. They are always willing to accept criticism from guests.
　　He said, "This is very important for us developing countries. If we are satisfied with what we have achieved, then we cannot continue to develop."
　　He praised the Chinese people's high revolutionary spirit. He said, "What the Chinese people are considering today is revolution and supporting the oppressed people. They have a very high degree of solidarity with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In China, even very young children know about the struggle in Vietnam." He said: We believe that no matter what, the Chinese people will never change their support for the revolutionary struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism. We oppressed people place our hopes on China. He expressed that he would cherish the friendship between the people of Tanzania and China.

    坦桑尼亚朋友赞扬中国人民遵循毛主席教导不断进行革命
    中国是世界被压迫人民的真正希望
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆八日电　坦桑尼亚乡村发展和国民文化部长姆贡贾七日晚在这里赞扬毛泽东主席是中国革命的伟大领袖。他还说：“中国是今天全世界所有被压迫人民的真正希望。新解放的国家的希望寄托在伟大的国家——中国身上。”
    这位坦桑尼亚部长是在中国驻坦桑尼亚大使何英为最近对中国进行友好访问后回到坦桑尼亚的坦桑尼亚文化、教育和工会代表团举行的招待会上讲话时这样说的。
    他指出，中国正在使它的文化作为反对帝国主义侵略和颠覆的武器。他说，坦桑尼亚也将用它的文化作为反对帝国主义侵略的巨大武器。
    他说，坦桑尼亚和中国的友谊是以互相尊重主权为基础的。在这以前，何英大使在讲话中说，中国在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，今天正在进行社会主义文化大革命；并且在这场革命中取得伟大的胜利。他还指出，坦桑尼亚三个代表团访华成功加强了两国的友谊。
    招待会是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的。出席招待会的有坦桑尼亚三个代表团的成员。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆八日电　最近访问过中国的坦噶尼喀全国工人联合会代表团团长鲁韦加西拉八日对这里的新华社记者谈到访问中国的印象时说：“中国人民，不管老少，都非常热心地学习毛泽东主席的著作”“他们的政治觉悟、他们对毛主席著作的热爱使我们非常感动。”
    他赞扬毛主席提出的自力更生的政策。他说，在中国，“你可以看到每一个人，不论是工厂的工人，人民公社的农民，还是机关的工作人员，他们都知道，建设国家就要靠他们自己，而不能倚靠别人。这大大有助于中国的经济、新技术和文化革命的发展。在修正主义者企图破坏中国的建设以后，中国人民就完全自己倚靠自己，他们已经取得了如此巨大的成就。”
    他接着说：“这给其他发展中的国家上了一课。我国也有敌人企图破坏我们的国家。我们要保卫我们的独立、主权，避免帝国主义阴谋的祸害。我们也需要采取自力更生的政策。”
    他还指出，中国人民以巨大的热情学习毛主席著作。在毛主席关于不断革命的教导下，中国人民虽然取得了巨大成就，但是他们仍然刻苦努力，争取更大的成就。他们总是愿意接受来宾的批评。
    他说，“这对我们发展中的国家来说是非常重要的。如果我们满足于我们所取得的成就，那么，我们就不可能继续发展。”
    他盛赞中国人民高度的革命精神。他说，“中国人民今天考虑的是革命和支持被压迫人民。他们同亚非拉人民有着非常高度的团结。在中国，甚至很小的孩子也知道越南的斗争。”他说：我们相信，不论什么时候，中国人民决不会改变他们支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义的革命斗争。我们被压迫人民把希望寄托在中国身上。他表示要珍视坦桑尼亚和中国两国人民之间的友谊。
