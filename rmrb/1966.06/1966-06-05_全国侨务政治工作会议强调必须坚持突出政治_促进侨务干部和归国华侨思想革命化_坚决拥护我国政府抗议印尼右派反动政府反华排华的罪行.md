    Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd – The National Overseas Chinese Affairs Political Work Conference convened by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission recently took place in Beijing.

    This was a conference that highlighted politics and creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. The heads of overseas Chinese affairs departments, state-owned overseas Chinese farms, and overseas Chinese schools from various regions, as well as the heads of overseas Chinese-run enterprises and institutions who participated in the conference, studied Chairman Mao's discourses on highlighting politics, especially on class struggle and people's war. On this basis, everyone analyzed the excellent current international and domestic situation, and also promoted democracy, checked their thinking and work against Chairman Mao's discourses in the spirit of rectification, using the method of "one divides into two," and summarized their experiences.

    When discussing the current situation, the conference expressed great indignation at the Indonesian right-wing reactionary government's crimes of anti-China and persecution of Chinese and expressed deep concern and sympathy for the affected overseas Chinese. The conference expressed resolute support for the protests lodged by our government to the Indonesian government and firmly demanded that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary government immediately cease its persecution of overseas Chinese, earnestly guarantee the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and ensure the safe return to the motherland of overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return. They also stated that they would make all necessary preparations to welcome the affected overseas Chinese from Indonesia to return to the motherland to participate in the great socialist construction.

    When the conference discussed how to highlight politics on the overseas Chinese affairs front, a great debate unfolded on the relationship between politics and production, and between politics and professional work. Everyone believed that in recent years, the party's political direction had been adhered to on the overseas Chinese affairs front, but compared with advanced units, there was still a great gap in highlighting politics. The most fundamental thing was the insufficient understanding of the strategic significance of highlighting politics, the insufficient understanding that highlighting politics must be implemented in promoting the ideological revolutionization of people, and that it could not keep up with the requirements of the development of the situation. The conference proposed: It is necessary to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in highlighting politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, vigorously grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, actively guide returned overseas Chinese and the families of overseas Chinese to participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and promote the ideological revolutionization of overseas Chinese affairs cadres and returned overseas Chinese and their families. Only in this way can overseas Chinese affairs work adapt to the needs of the current socialist revolution, adapt to the requirements of the Third Five-Year Plan, and be prepared at any time to oppose the aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism against our country.

    The conference emphasized: Highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. The overseas Chinese affairs front must take Mao Zedong Thought as its guide, place the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, take Chairman Mao's works as the supreme instruction for all work, implement them in all actions, study and apply them repeatedly, and transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world, and promote the continuous revolutionization of their thinking.

    The conference discussed the socialist cultural revolution that is currently being carried out in depth, pointing out that this is an extremely sharp struggle in the ideological field to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. It is a key issue in the in-depth development of the socialist revolution in our country at the present stage, and it is a matter of paramount importance related to the future of our country's revolution and the future of the world revolution. Through studying Chairman Mao's relevant discourses on class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, the comrades participating in the conference further realized in the discussions that the overthrown bourgeoisie is always trying to transform our world with their worldview. A socialist revolution on the economic front alone is not enough and is not consolidated; it is also necessary to carry out a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field over who influences whom and who defeats whom will take a very long time, several decades, or even a hundred to several hundred years to resolve. The situation on the overseas Chinese affairs front is even more so. For this reason, everyone stated that the comrades on the overseas Chinese affairs front must actively engage in the current struggle of the cultural revolution. Through this struggle, vigorously promote proletarian ideology, vigorously eliminate bourgeois ideology, and carry the socialist revolution in the ideological field to the end.

    The conference also pointed out: It is necessary to continue to guide returned overseas Chinese and their families to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements together with the people of the whole country, and, in light of their characteristics, give play to their active role in the three great revolutionary movements, and promote the continuous revolutionization of their thinking. Only in this way can it be conducive to gradually narrowing the three major differences, conducive to strengthening the unity of overseas Chinese households and non-overseas Chinese households, and to jointly striving for the construction of the motherland and the construction of overseas Chinese hometowns. To this end:

    The conference emphasized that it is necessary to educate returned overseas Chinese and their families to establish the idea of working for the revolution, to participate in labor within their ability, to love the collective, love the Party, love the motherland, practice diligence and thrift, and change customs; to educate returned overseas Chinese and their families to save against famine, store grain in preparation for famine, and save money for future use. State-owned overseas Chinese farms must adhere to the principle of running farms according to Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the socialist direction; it is necessary to vigorously grasp the ideological revolutionization of employees, and cadres must "darken their skin and temper their hearts red" in participating in labor; it is necessary to fully promote the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. Overseas Chinese schools must adhere to the policy of education serving proletarian politics, gradually implement two kinds of education systems and two kinds of labor systems, and cultivate the younger generation of returned overseas Chinese into a generation of young people with Mao Zedong Thought, who are both red and expert, and capable of both civilian and military affairs. To this end, emphasis should be placed on the transformation of the teaching staff, prompting them to revolutionize.

    It is necessary to fully recognize the long-term and complex nature of the transformation of people from the bourgeoisie among returned overseas Chinese and their families, and strengthen their education and transformation.

    Faced with the threat of U.S. imperialism launching a war of aggression, the conference proposed: It is necessary to strengthen the education of returned overseas Chinese and their families on the situation, so that they can establish the idea of dealing with U.S. imperialist aggression and actively do their jobs well.

    The conference believed that overseas Chinese affairs work must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people of China and the people of the world," have the motherland in mind, and have the world in view. To this end, it is necessary to further launch a high tide of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among returned overseas Chinese and their families, and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought; actively guide returned overseas Chinese and their families to learn from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Mai Xiande, and establish a worldview of not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of death, not seeking fame or profit, being wholeheartedly for the revolution, and everything for the Chinese people and the people of the world. The conference took the People's Liberation Army, Daqing, and Dazhai as advanced models and searched for shortcomings in a big way. The conference believed that it is necessary to further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction; it is necessary to further carry out the movement to learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and learn from Dazhai, compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass; it is necessary to adhere to the "four firsts," vigorously grasp living ideas; strengthen grassroots construction; follow the mass line, launch mass movements in a big way, and strive to make more overseas Chinese-run enterprises and institutions into Daqing-style and Dazhai-style units.

    Seventeen representatives of advanced units and advanced individuals in the overseas Chinese affairs front who creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works introduced their advanced experiences at the conference, which greatly inspired the participants.

    The conference believed that the leading bodies of overseas Chinese affairs departments must be revolutionized. There are five requirements for realizing the revolutionization of leadership: 1. Highlight politics, put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, leaders should grasp it, grasp the leaders, leaders should study, leaders should lead, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform thinking, improve style, and improve work; 2. Go deep into the masses, go deep into the grassroots, go to the countryside and farms to stay at selected points, conduct investigations and research, and grasp first-hand materials; 3. Correctly implement democratic centralism, fully promote democracy, truly treat people equally, humbly listen to different opinions from the masses, and consciously accept the supervision of the masses; 4. Participate in the three great revolutionary movements, adhere to the system of cadres participating in labor; 5. Boldly cultivate and promote young cadres who are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people and the people of the world, are able to unite the majority to work together, and have a democratic style and a spirit of self-criticism, and enrich the leading bodies.

    全国侨务政治工作会议强调必须坚持突出政治
    促进侨务干部和归国华侨思想革命化
    坚决拥护我国政府抗议印尼右派反动政府反华排华的罪行
    新华社三日讯　华侨事务委员会召开的全国侨务政治工作会议最近在北京举行。
    这是一次突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的会议。参加会议的各地侨务部门、国营华侨农场、华侨学校负责人和侨办企业、事业单位的负责人，在会上学习了毛主席有关突出政治、特别是有关阶级斗争和人民战争的论述。在这个基础上，大家分析了当前国际国内的大好形势，并且发扬民主，以整风精神，运用一分为二的方法，对照毛主席的论述检查思想，检查工作，总结了经验。
    在谈到当前的形势时，会议对印度尼西亚右派反动政府反华排华、迫害华侨的罪行，表示极大的愤慨，对受害的华侨表示深切的关怀和慰问，会议表示坚决拥护我国政府对印度尼西亚政府提出的抗议，坚决要求印度尼西亚右派反动政府立即停止对华侨的迫害，切实保证华侨生命财产的安全，保证自愿回国的华侨安全返回祖国。他们还表示要做好一切准备工作，准备迎接印度尼西亚的受害华侨回到祖国来参加伟大的社会主义建设。
    会议讨论到在侨务战线上如何突出政治的问题时，对政治和生产、政治和业务的关系展开了大辩论。大家认为，近年来，在侨务战线上坚持了党的政治方向，但在突出政治上和先进单位相比，还有着很大的差距。最根本的是对突出政治的战略意义认识不足，对突出政治要落实到促进人的思想革命化上认识不足，跟不上形势发展的要求。会议提出：必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，大抓阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，积极引导归国华侨和华侨眷属参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，促进侨务干部和归国华侨、华侨眷属的思想革命化，只有这样，才能使侨务工作适应目前社会主义革命的需要，适应第三个五年计划的要求，并能随时准备反对美帝国主义对我国发动的侵略战争。
    会议强调指出：突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。侨务战线必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把毛主席著作作为各项工作的最高指示，贯彻到一切行动中去，反复学、反复用，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，促进思想的不断革命化。
    会议讨论了当前正在深入开展的社会主义文化大革命，指出这是意识形态领域内极其尖锐的一场兴无灭资的斗争，是现阶段我国社会主义革命深入发展的关键问题，是关系到我国革命前途和世界革命前途的头等大事。参加会议的同志通过学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的有关论述，在讨论中进一步认识到：被推翻了的资产阶级总是力图以他们的世界观改造我们的世界，单有经济战线的社会主义革命是不够的，并且是不巩固的；还必须在政治战线和思想战线上进行彻底的社会主义革命。在意识形态领域内社会主义和资本主义之间谁影响谁、谁战胜谁的斗争，需要一个很长的时间，要几十年，甚至要一百年到几百年的时间才能解决。侨务战线的情况更是如此。为此大家表示，侨务战线的同志要积极投入当前文化大革命的斗争中去。通过这场斗争，大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，把意识形态领域内兴无灭资的社会主义革命进行到底。
    会议还指出：必须继续引导归国华侨、华侨眷属和全国人民一道，积极参加三大革命运动，针对他们的特点，发挥他们在三大革命运动中的积极作用，促进他们思想的不断革命化。这样，才能有利于逐步缩小三大差别，有利于加强侨户和非侨户人民的团结，为建设祖国、建设侨乡而共同奋斗。为此：
    会议强调必须教育归国华侨、华侨眷属树立为革命而劳动的思想，参加力所能及的劳动，热爱集体、热爱党、热爱祖国、勤俭持家、移风易俗；教育归国华侨、华侨眷属节约防歉、储粮备荒、储钱备用。国营华侨农场必须坚持按照毛泽东思想办农场，坚持社会主义方向；要大抓职工的思想革命化，干部要在参加劳动中“晒黑了皮肤，炼红了心”；要充分发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神。华侨学校必须坚持教育为无产阶级政治服务的方针，逐步贯彻两种教育制度、两种劳动制度，把归侨青年一代培养成为具有毛泽东思想的、又红又专的、能文能武的年轻一代。为此，应突出对教师队伍的改造，促使他们革命化。
    必须充分认识归国华侨、华侨眷属中资产阶级人们改造的长期性、复杂性，加强对他们的教育、改造。
    面对着美帝国主义发动侵略战争的威胁，会议提出：必须加强对归国华侨、华侨眷属的形势教育，使他们树立对付美帝国主义侵略战争的思想，积极做好自己岗位的工作。
    会议认为，侨务工作必须遵循毛主席“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的教导，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。为此，必须进一步掀起归国华侨、华侨眷属活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑；积极引导归国华侨、华侨眷属学习雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得，树立不怕苦、不怕死、不为名、不为利、一心为革命、一切为中国人民和世界人民的世界观。会议以解放军、大庆、大寨为先进样板，大找差距。会议认为，必须进一步贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线；必须进一步开展学解放军、学大庆、学大寨的比、学、赶、帮、超运动；要坚持四个第一，狠抓活思想；加强基层建设；走群众路线，大搞群众运动，争取更多的侨办企业、事业成为大庆式、大寨式的单位。
    有十七名侨务战线活学活用毛主席著作先进单位的代表和先进人物，在会上介绍了先进经验，使参加会议的人受到很大鼓舞。
    会议认为，侨务部门的领导班子必须革命化，实现领导革命化有五点要求：一、突出政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，头头抓、抓头头，头头学，头头带，用毛泽东思想改造思想，改进作风，改进工作；二、深入群众、深入基层，下乡、下场蹲点，调查研究，掌握第一手材料；三、正确贯彻民主集中制，充分发扬民主，真正做到平等待人，虚心听取群众的不同意见，自觉接受群众的监督；四、参加三大革命运动，坚持干部参加劳动的制度；五、大胆培养、提拔忠实于毛泽东思想，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务，能够团结多数人一道工作，有民主作风和自我批评精神的年轻干部，充实领导班子。
