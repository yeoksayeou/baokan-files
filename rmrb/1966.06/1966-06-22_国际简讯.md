    International Briefs
    Indian Government Announces Rupee Devaluation by One-Third
    New Delhi dispatch: The Indian government announced on the 5th that it was devaluing the Indian currency, the rupee, by 36.5 percent. It was announced that the previous official exchange rate was 4.76 rupees to one US dollar, and is now 7.5 rupees to one US dollar.
    According to Indian newspapers citing senior Indian political figures, the Indian government decided to devalue the rupee "on the orders of the World Bank" controlled by the United States. It was revealed that the President of the World Bank, George Woods, told Indian Planning Minister Asoka Mehta in Washington that if the rupee was not devalued, "India can forget about getting aid from Western countries."
    US National Debt Limit Increased by Another Two Billion Dollars
    Washington dispatch: The US Congress passed a bill on the 16th authorizing the government to raise the current temporary national debt limit by another two billion dollars, reaching a new peak of three hundred and thirty billion dollars.
    This shows that the increasingly large expenditure on the war of aggression against Vietnam is putting the US finances into an even more strained situation. The Johnson administration originally requested that the national debt limit be raised by four billion dollars.
    It is revealed that the current total amount of US national debt has already increased to three hundred and twenty-six billion dollars.
    West German Reactionaries Give a Loan to the Indonesian Right Wing
    Bonn dispatch: The West German Foreign Ministry announced on the 20th that the West German government has decided to grant a loan of 30 million West German marks to the right-wing military regime in Indonesia.
    After the Indonesian right-wing military regime came to power in March of this year, it faced serious economic difficulties and specially dispatched government officials to beg for aid everywhere. In addition to West Germany, it also begged for "aid" from the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, as well as India, Japan, and other countries.

    国际简讯
    印度政府宣布卢比贬值三分之一
    新德里消息：印度政府五日宣布把印度货币卢比贬值百分之三十六点五。据宣布，前官方兑换率是四点七六卢比换一美元，现在是七点五卢比换一美元。
    据印度报纸援引印度高级政界人士的话透露，印度政府是按照美国控制的“世界银行的命令”而决定卢比贬值的。据透露，世界银行行长乔治·伍兹曾经在华盛顿告诉印度计划部长阿索卡·梅达说，如果卢比不贬值，“印度就休想拿到西方国家的援助。”
    美国国债限额再提高二十亿美元
    华盛顿消息：美国国会十六日通过法案，授权政府把美国现行的临时性国债限额再提高二十亿美元，达到三千三百亿美元的新高峰。
    这表明了日益庞大的侵越战争开支正在使美国财政陷入更加捉襟见肘的窘境。约翰逊政府原来要求把国债限额提高四十亿美元。
    据透露，目前美国国债总数已经增加到三千二百二十六亿美元。
    西德反动派给印尼右派一笔贷款
    波恩消息：西德外交部二十日宣布，西德政府决定给印度尼西亚的右派军人政权一笔为数三千万西德马克的贷款。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权在今年三月上台以后，由于面临严重的经济困难，特地派出政府官员四出乞援。除了西德以外，它还曾问美国、苏联、荷兰，以及印度、日本等国政府乞讨“援助”。
