    (Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 14th) At the plenary session of the World Peace Council held here on the 13th, Dinh Ba Thi, representative of South Vietnam, and Nguyen Duy Trinh, representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered reports on the Vietnam issue.

    In his report, Dinh Ba Thi, representative of South Vietnam, severely condemned the various crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in South Vietnam. He exposed the "peace talks" deception promoted by U.S. imperialism to save its defeat. He pointed out that for more than a year, every time Johnson advocated peace, he immediately shipped more U.S. troops and weapons to South Vietnam, further escalating and expanding the war.

    He also emphasized, in response to the U.S. plot to use the United Nations to "supervise" the South Vietnamese puppet elections, that the South Vietnamese people most severely condemned the above-mentioned deception and reiterated once again that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. The South Vietnamese representative reiterated that the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the steadfast position of the South Vietnamese people.

    Nguyen Duy Trinh, representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, exposed the U.S. "peace negotiation" deception in his speech, saying that as the U.S. imperialists talk about peace, there will immediately be larger-scale war actions. He emphasized that true peace and true independence are inseparable and reiterated the four-point proposition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the settlement of the Vietnam issue.

    In his speech on the Vietnam issue, Soviet representative Kornechuk continued to promote the Soviet leading group's scheme of false support and genuine betrayal. He hypocritically expressed verbal support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people but refused to explicitly demand that the United States immediately withdraw all its armed forces from South Vietnam, stop its aggression against the entire Vietnam, and recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people. Kornechuk openly advocated that conflicts should be stopped before they "generalize," attempting to force the Vietnamese people to stop their struggle and help the United States realize its "peace talks" scheme. He also attempted to peddle the private goods of "joint action," demanding that support actions for Vietnam from all over the world be "united" to conceal the traitorous face of the Soviet leading group selling out the interests of the Vietnamese people and attempting to stir up anti-China waves.

    Kornechuk's speech echoed that of U.S. representative Goodell. This U.S. representative, who is very closely related to the Washington rulers, tried his best to peddle Johnson's "peace talks" deception in his speech.

    At the same time, Indian representative Chandra, in a report on institutional issues on behalf of the leadership of the World Peace Council, also touted the "Tashkent spirit" in the same tone as the Soviet leaders, attempting to extend this spirit to the Vietnam issue and serve the U.S. "peace talks" deception. He said that the Tashkent Agreement is an example of countries "resolving differences" and "abandoning force in favor of a policy of negotiation."

    It is worth noting that in the speech of the U.S. representative and in the report on disarmament issues arranged by the leadership of the World Peace Council, the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas" was brazenly manufactured. In the above-mentioned speeches and reports, when mentioning China, the terms "Mainland China" and "Red China" habitually used by U.S. imperialism were used.

    Li Chuwen, head of the Chinese delegation, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in his speech, exposing the various crimes of the Soviet revisionist group in serving the United States on the Vietnam issue. Li Chuwen pointed out that the Soviet leading group is acting as the most loyal and active broker for the United States on the Vietnam issue. They are doing everything possible to cooperate with U.S. imperialism, promote the "peace talks" deception, and attempt to help the United States extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle and bring the Vietnam issue into the orbit of "Soviet-U.S. cooperation."

    After Li Chuwen's speech, he also lodged a strong protest against the "two Chinas" conspiracy that appeared at the meeting. He issued a statement saying: The Chinese delegation must solemnly point out that the reactionary arguments of "two Chinas" that appeared at this afternoon's meeting, in the conference reports arranged under the baton of the Soviet Union, and in the speeches of the U.S. representatives, have repeatedly slandered the People's Republic of China as "Red China" and "Mainland China." He solemnly declared: "We strongly protest this conspiracy to create 'two Chinas.'"

    At the meeting that day, the Soviet representative and his followers also made a big fuss on issues such as "preventing nuclear proliferation" and "complete and thorough disarmament," and tried their best to promote the line of Soviet-U.S. "cooperation." The opening remarks of the meeting and certain reports arranged by the leadership of the World Peace Council echoed the Soviet representative, trying their best to promote nuclear terror, touting the Moscow Partial Test Ban Treaty, and advocating "preventing nuclear proliferation." The opening remarks of the meeting and the report on disarmament issues all clamored to pull China into the so-called "World Disarmament Conference," attempting to deprive China of its right to develop nuclear weapons for self-defense.

    Li Chuwen, head of the Chinese delegation, forcefully refuted these conspiracies and tricks in his speech. He pointed out that China's necessary and limited nuclear tests and the development of nuclear weapons are to oppose the nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats of U.S. imperialism and its collaborators, to oppose the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union to implement nuclear monopoly and undermine the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, and to defend national security and world peace. Li Chuwen said that someone openly declared to pull China into the so-called disarmament conference of Soviet-U.S. cooperation, restricting our hands and feet, which is absolutely impossible.

    In order to implement the revisionist line of the Soviet leading group in the world peace movement, the manipulators of this meeting used extremely undemocratic methods from the beginning of the meeting. After the opening of the meeting, they activated the voting machine and forcibly passed the pre-prepared rules of procedure for the meeting, stipulating that speeches at the meeting "must not deviate from the topic," the speaking time for each representative must not exceed ten minutes, and only documents accepted by the presidium of the meeting can be submitted to the plenary session, etc. Chinese and Albanian representatives immediately expressed opposition to this dictatorial practice. Chinese representative Li Shoubao pointed out that this set of rules of procedure completely violates basic democratic principles, and its purpose is to impose an erroneous line on others and legitimize it. Albanian representative Kanci questioned: When talking about the Vietnam issue, does expressing opposition to U.S. imperialism and its partners count as "deviating from the topic"? The chairman of the conference, Blum, dared not answer these legitimate questions and had to hastily activate the voting machine.

    世界和平理事会议上越南南北方代表重申严正立场谴责美帝和谈骗局
  　反对联合国干涉越南问题
    我国代表团强烈抗议美苏策划“两个中国”的阴谋
    苏联代表和美国代表一唱一和竭力兜售约翰逊和谈骗局
    据新华社日内瓦十四日电  在世界和平理事会十三日在这里举行的全体会议上，越南南方代表丁伯诗和越南民主共和国代表阮维性先后作了关于越南问题的报告。
    越南南方代表丁伯诗在报告中严厉谴责美帝国主义在越南南方所犯下的种种罪行，他拆穿了美帝国主义为了挽救其败局而推行的“和谈”骗局。他指出，一年多来，约翰逊每鼓吹一次和平，紧接着就把更多的美国军队和武器运往越南南方，进一步加剧和扩大战争。
    他还针对美国策划利用联合国“监督”越南南方傀儡选举的阴谋强调说，越南南方人民最严厉地谴责上述骗局，并且再一次重申：联合国根本无权干涉越南问题。越南南方代表重申，越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明是越南南方人民坚定不移的立场。
    越南民主共和国代表阮维性在发言中揭露美国的“和平谈判”骗局说，在美帝国主义者大谈和平的时候，立即就会有更大规模的战争行动。他强调真正的和平和真正的独立是不可分割的，并且重申了越南民主共和国关于解决越南问题的四项主张。
    苏联代表考涅楚克在就越南问题发言时，继续推行苏联领导集团的假支持、真出卖的阴谋。他虚伪地在口头上表示支持越南人民的斗争，却不肯明确要求美国立即从南越撤出它的一切武装力量、停止对整个越南的侵略、承认南越民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一真正代表。考涅楚克公开鼓吹所谓在冲突还没有“普遍化”时就应该加以制止，妄图迫使越南人民停止斗争，帮助美国实现“和谈”阴谋。他还企图偷售“联合行动”的私货，要求把世界各地对越南的声援行动“联合在一起”，以掩饰苏联领导集团出卖越南人民利益的叛徒面目，并且企图煽起反华浪潮。
    考涅楚克的发言是同美国代表古德莱特互相呼应的。同华盛顿统治者关系十分密切的这个美国代表，在发言中竭力兜售约翰逊的“和谈”骗局。
    同时，印度代表钱德拉在代表世界和平理事会领导机构作的关于机构问题的报告中，也仿照苏联领导人的腔调吹捧“塔什干精神”，企图把这种精神扩大到越南问题上，为美国的“和谈”骗局服务。他说什么塔什干协议是国与国之间“解决分歧”、“放弃武力并代之以谈判的政策”的榜样。
    值得注意的是：在美国代表的发言中和世界和平理事会领导机构安排的关于裁军问题的报告中，竟然明目张胆地制造“两个中国”的阴谋。在上述发言和报告中提到中国时竟用了美帝国主义所惯用的“大陆中国”和“红色中国”的字眼。
    中国代表团团长李储文在发言中高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，揭穿了苏联修正主义集团在越南问题上为美国效劳的种种罪行。李储文指出，苏联领导集团在越南问题上充当美国最忠实、最积极的掮客。他们千方百计地配合美帝国主义，推销“和谈”骗局，企图帮助美国扑灭越南人民革命斗争的烈火，把越南问题纳入“苏美合作”的轨道。
    李储文发言后，还就会议上出现的“两个中国”的阴谋提出强烈抗议。他发表声明说：中国代表团必须严正指出，在今天下午会议上所出现的“两个中国”的反动论调，在苏联指挥棒下所安排的会议报告中以及美国代表的发言中，竟然一再诬蔑中华人民共和国是“红色中国”、“大陆中国”。他严正声明说：“我们对这种策划‘两个中国’的阴谋，提出严重抗议。”
    苏联代表及其追随者在这一天的会议上还在所谓“防止核扩散”和“全面彻底裁军”等问题上大作文章，竭力推行苏美“合作”的路线。世界和理会领导机构安排的会议开幕词以及某些报告，都同苏联代表一唱一和，竭力宣扬核恐怖，吹捧莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约，鼓吹“防止核扩散”。会议开幕词和关于裁军问题的报告都叫嚷要把中国拉入所谓“世界裁军会议”，企图剥夺中国为自卫而发展核武器的权利。
    中国代表团团长李储文在发言中对这些阴谋诡计进行了有力的回击。他指出，中国进行必要而有限的核试验，发展核武器，是为了反对美帝国主义及其合作者的核讹诈和核威胁，是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，是为了保卫国家安全和世界和平。李储文说，有人公然宣称要把中国拉入苏美合作的所谓裁军会议，束缚我们的手脚，那是绝对办不到的。
    这次会议的操纵者为了在世界和平运动中贯彻苏联领导集团的修正主义路线，从会议一开始就使用了极端不民主的手法。他们在会议开幕后开动表决机器，强行通过事先准备好了的会议议事规程，规定会议上的发言“不许离开议题”，每个代表的发言时间不得超过十分钟，只有经过会议主席团接受的文件才能提交全体会议等等。中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表当即表示反对这种独裁的作法。中国代表李寿宝指出，这套议事规程完全违反基本民主原则，其目的在于把错误路线强加于人并使之合法化。阿尔巴尼亚代表堪希质问道：在谈越南问题时如果表示反对美帝国主义及其合伙者是否算“离题”？大会主席布鲁姆不敢回答这些正当的质问，只好匆匆忙忙地开动了表决机器。
