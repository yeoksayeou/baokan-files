    Firing at the Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others exposed the conspiracy of the Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun black gang and opened fire on them. This is the result of you giving prominence to politics and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings. You are acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and your fearless heroic spirit of "daring to unhorse the emperor" is worthy of praise and learning. Your spirit has enlightened us. We revolutionary youth must not believe in bourgeois "authorities." We must use Mao Zedong Thought to examine the words and deeds of these "authorities." We must expose and criticize without any ambiguity anything that does not conform to or violates Mao Zedong Thought.

    向资产阶级“权威”开火
    聂元梓等同志揭露了宋硕、陆平、彭珮云黑帮的阴谋，向他们开火了。这是你们突出了政治，活学活用毛主席著作的结果。你们按照毛主席的教导办事，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏英雄气概，值得大家赞扬和学习。你们的这种精神，启发了我们。我们革命青年决不能相信资产阶级“权威”。对这些“权威”的言行，必须用毛泽东思想加以检查，凡是不符合和违背毛泽东思想的，我们必须揭露和批判，毫不含糊。
