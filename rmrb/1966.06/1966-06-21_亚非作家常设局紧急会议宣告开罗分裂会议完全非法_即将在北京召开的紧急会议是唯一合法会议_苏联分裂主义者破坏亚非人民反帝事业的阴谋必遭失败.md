    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th - Statement of the Emergency Meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau

    The Emergency Meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, held in Beijing on June 20, 1966, with the participation of Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan, expresses great indignation and strongly condemns the splitter meeting held in Cairo. This splitter meeting, usurping the name of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, conspired to move the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau from Colombo to Cairo, which is a crime of the Soviet splittists in creating an open split in the Afro-Asian people's movement.

    As is well known, the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, like all other fraternal Afro-Asian movements, is completely independent. However, some people are always trying to turn the Afro-Asian Writers' movement into an organization subordinate to the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo. This is utterly absurd!

    The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, with Mr. Senanayake as Secretary-General, is the only legal permanent body of the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference. This body is, of course, supported by all revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa.

    The Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting, to be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966, was decided upon after democratic consultation by the Permanent Bureau and was reaffirmed by the Permanent Bureau meeting held in Beijing from June 9 to 10, 1966. This is the only legal meeting, and the splitter meeting in Cairo is completely illegal.

    The meeting firmly points out that the Permanent Bureau meeting will be held in Beijing as scheduled on June 23-24, 1966, and the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966. Both meetings are bound to achieve great victories.

    The meeting warmly welcomes the steady stream of Afro-Asian writers from various Afro-Asian countries who have come to Beijing to attend our Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting.

    The splitter meeting in Cairo was orchestrated by the culprit Soviet splittists. These traitors are determined to damage, split, and destroy the great anti-imperialist cause of the peoples of Asia and Africa, especially the great struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism. The splitting conspiracy plotted by these traitors is doomed to utter failure.

    Victory belongs to the revolutionary Afro-Asian writers!

    Xinhua News Agency, June 20th - The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held an emergency meeting in Beijing tonight, at which a statement was unanimously adopted, strongly condemning the Soviet splittists for usurping the name of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and convening a splitter meeting in Cairo on the 19th to sabotage the cause of anti-imperialist unity of the Afro-Asian peoples and conspiring to move the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau from Colombo to Cairo.

    Representatives from Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan attended the meeting.

    Mr. Manuweera, Representative of the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and Chairman of the Emergency Meeting of the Permanent Bureau, strongly condemned the splitter meeting planned by the Soviet revisionists in Cairo in his speech. He said that the Soviet revisionists and their followers have consistently engaged in splitting and undermining the Afro-Asian revolutionary movement and revolutionary struggle, betraying the interests of the Afro-Asian people. The Soviet revisionists have gathered and collected the worst people, reactionaries, and revisionists from various countries to Cairo. The conspiracies and tricks played by the Soviet revisionists are not only aimed at our emergency meeting, but also at the revolutionary activities of Afro-Asian revolutionary organizations and Afro-Asian revolutionary people.

    Mr. Manuweera spoke about the so-called Ceylonese representative who participated in the splitter meeting in Cairo. Mr. Manuweera said that he could not represent the Ceylonese revolutionary writers at all. He is actually the number one reactionary in Ceylon, the revisionist element in Ceylon.

    Sudanese representative Osman Hassan Ahmed said that the splitter meeting held under the planning of the Soviet revisionists is to sabotage the fighting unity of Asia and Africa, to sabotage the cause against imperialism and against modern revisionism, and against supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    He said that the so-called Sudanese representative who participated in the splitter meeting betrayed the interests of the Sudanese people and has become the mouthpiece of imperialism and revisionism. Facts have proved that the revisionists are falsely supporting the Vietnamese people and truly helping U.S. imperialism.

    Indonesian representative Agam Wispi said that the so-called Indonesian representative who participated in the Cairo splitter meeting is a representative of the Nasution and Suharto reactionary regime and cannot represent the Indonesian people at all. He expressed his firm belief that the conspiracy to split and undermine the struggle of the Afro-Asian people is doomed to failure.

    Ghanaian delegation leader John Koffie Aylma said that the statement expressed the feelings of the revolutionary people. The illegal Cairo meeting attempting to move the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau from Colombo to Cairo is shocking. He pointed out that the so-called Ghanaian representative who attended the Cairo splitter meeting followed U.S. imperialism and is a saboteur.

    The representatives of Japan, China, and Cameroon expressed their full support for the statement of the Permanent Bureau's emergency meeting and strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' splitting crimes. They pointed out that the statement embodies the unity of Afro-Asian writers and is a powerful counterattack against all sabotage activities of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

    亚非作家常设局紧急会议宣告开罗分裂会议完全非法
    即将在北京召开的紧急会议是唯一合法会议
    苏联分裂主义者破坏亚非人民反帝事业的阴谋必遭失败
    新华社二十日讯　亚非作家常设局紧急会议声明
    一九六六年六月二十日在北京举行的有喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、加纳、印度尼西亚、日本和苏丹参加的亚非作家常设局紧急会议，对在开罗召开的分裂会议表示极大的愤慨，并加以强烈谴责。这次分裂会议盗用亚非作家常设局的名义，阴谋将亚非作家常设局从科伦坡迁往开罗，这是苏联分裂主义者在亚非人民运动中制造公开分裂的罪行。
    众所周知，亚非作家会议，正如所有其他兄弟亚非运动一样，是完全独立的。但是有些人总是企图把亚非作家运动变成从属于设在开罗的亚非人民团结组织常设书记处的机构。这是十分荒谬的！
    由森纳那亚克先生担任秘书长的亚非作家常设局是亚非作家会议唯一的合法常设机构。这一机构当然得到亚非所有革命作家的支持。
    一九六六年六月二十七日至七月六日将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议是常设局经过民主协商决定的，并为一九六六年六月九日至十日在北京举行的常设局会议所再次肯定。这是唯一的合法会议，而开罗的分裂会议是完全非法的。
    会议坚决指出，一九六六年六月二十三日至二十四日将如期在北京召开常设局会议，并将于一九六六年六月二十七日至七月六日在北京召开亚非作家紧急会议。这两个会议必将取得伟大的胜利。
    会议热烈欢迎源源不断从亚非各国来到北京参加我们亚非作家紧急会议的亚非作家。
    开罗的分裂会议是由祸首苏联分裂主义者一手策划的，这些叛徒执意损害、分裂和破坏亚非各国人民伟大的反帝事业，特别是当前英雄的越南人民正在进行的伟大的反对美帝国主义的斗争。这些叛徒所策划的分裂阴谋，是注定要遭到彻底失败的。
    胜利属于革命的亚非作家！
    据新华社二十日讯　亚非作家常设局今晚在北京召开紧急会议，会上一致通过一项声明，强烈谴责苏联分裂主义者盗用亚非作家常设局的名义，于十九日在开罗召开分裂会议，破坏亚非人民反帝团结的事业，并阴谋将亚非作家常设局从科伦坡迁往开罗。
    出席会议的有喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、加纳、印度尼西亚、日本和苏丹的代表。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长代表、常设局紧急会议主席曼努维拉在讲话中，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者在开罗策划的分裂会议。他说，苏联修正主义者和他们的追随者，一贯从事分裂、破坏亚非革命运动和革命斗争，出卖亚非人民的利益。苏联修正主义者从各国纠集和搜罗了最坏的人、反动派、修正主义分子集合到开罗去。苏联修正主义者玩弄的阴谋诡计，不仅针对我们的紧急会议，也是针对着亚非革命组织、亚非革命人民的革命活动。
    曼努维拉谈到在开罗参加分裂会议的所谓锡兰代表。曼努维拉说，他根本不能代表锡兰革命作家，他实际上是锡兰头号的反动派，锡兰的修正主义分子。
    苏丹代表奥斯曼·哈桑·艾哈迈德说，在苏联修正主义者策划下召开的分裂会议，是破坏亚非战斗团结，破坏反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义事业和反对支持越南人民斗争的。
    他说，参加分裂会议的所谓苏丹代表，出卖苏丹人民利益，已变成了帝国主义和修正主义的喉舌。事实证明，修正主义者是假支持越南人民，真帮助美帝国主义的。
    印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比说，参加开罗分裂会议的所谓印度尼西亚的代表，是纳苏蒂安和苏哈托反动政权的代表，绝不能代表印度尼西亚人民。他表示深信，分裂和破坏亚非人民斗争的阴谋注定要失败。
    加纳代表团团长约翰·科费爱·艾尔马说，声明表达了革命人民的感情。非法的开罗会议企图将亚非作家常设局从科伦坡迁往开罗，令人十分震惊。他指出，出席开罗分裂会议的所谓加纳代表追随美帝国主义，是破坏者。
    日本、中国、喀麦隆代表分别在会上表示完全支持常设局紧急会议的声明，并强烈谴责苏联修正主义者的分裂罪行。他们指出，声明体现了亚非作家的团结，是对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义的一切破坏活动的有力反击。
