    Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd—The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association issued a statement today, warmly welcoming and fully supporting the upcoming Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing. The statement pointed out that the attempt by Soviet revisionists and their followers to split the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting by organizing an illegal meeting in Cairo, and the so-called "resolutions" passed by this divisive meeting, are shameless and criminal acts, completely illegal, and wholly antagonistic to the revolutionary movement of Afro-Asian writers and the Afro-Asian people. The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association expresses its strong condemnation.
    The full text of the "Statement of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Supporting the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting and Condemning Soviet Separatists" is as follows:
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association warmly welcomes and fully supports the upcoming Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing.
    Currently, despite the massive concentration of armed forces and "gradual escalation" by the American aggressors, they have suffered one defeat after another in Vietnam, thanks to the resolute and vigorous struggle of the Vietnamese people. Their aggressive plans in Vietnam face the grim prospect of complete failure, so they are intensifying their two-faced tactics of expanding the war and "peace talks," desperately attempting to intimidate and deceive the Vietnamese people into abandoning their resolute struggle.
    Anti-imperialist Afro-Asian journalists are convinced that the freedom-loving Vietnamese people will continue to fight, inflicting heavier blows on the American aggressors, puppet troops, and puppet regime until they are all wiped out and driven out of Vietnam. Afro-Asian journalists are prepared to work alongside the heroic Vietnamese people to expose and crush all their attempts and conspiracies, as well as their "peace talk" swindles.
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association will do its utmost to support the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in achieving great success in inspiring the Vietnamese people to wage an uncompromising and resolute struggle against the American aggressors, and in mobilizing the Afro-Asian people to give broader and stronger support to the heroic Vietnamese people.
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association strongly condemns the Soviet pseudo-revolutionaries for gathering a small group of followers and organizing an illegal meeting in Cairo in a malicious attempt to split the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting. The Soviet pseudo-revolutionaries claim to be friends of the Afro-Asian people, clamoring for anti-imperialist "joint action," and boasting of their "resolute support" for the Vietnamese people. However, in reality, they have been doing their utmost to restrain the struggle of the Vietnamese people, shouting that "this war carries the danger of developing into a global atomic war," etc., and exerting pressure in order to collude closely with the American Johnson administration in seeking to achieve "peace talks." Their current activities to sabotage the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting once again prove that they are directly opposed to the interests of Afro-Asian writers and people, who are enthusiastically responding to the call for an emergency meeting in Beijing to discuss ways to support the Vietnamese people.
    The Soviet splitters have even gone so far as to fabricate a resolution at their "Cairo meeting" to "dismiss" Mr. Seneratne, the legitimate Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, and move the headquarters of the Bureau from Colombo to Cairo, and to hold their illegal "Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" in Baku, Soviet Union. This is a shameless and criminal act of splitting, completely hostile to the revolutionary movement of Afro-Asian writers and Afro-Asian people.
    Whenever the people's movement flourishes and overwhelms all the schemes and plots of the American imperialists, those false friends of the Afro-Asian people and true collaborators of the American imperialists come out to engage in divisive intrigues. However, just as their previous attempt to split the Japanese people's movement against "atomic and hydrogen bombs" ended in a shameful and disastrous defeat, their new criminal attempt to split the Afro-Asian writers' movement and the solidarity of Afro-Asian journalists, using a small group of reactionaries like Arifien Bey as their tools, is also doomed to a more shameful failure.
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association believes that exposing the criminal actions of the Soviet splitters and their collaborators and striking them down does not mean weakening our broad and genuine anti-imperialist front, but will greatly strengthen the anti-imperialist front, thereby expanding our common struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States.
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association declares that the upcoming Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing is the only legitimate meeting, convened according to the decision of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau and its Secretary-General; the Secretariat firmly condemns the attempts of the Soviet splitters and their followers as criminal and anti-people, and completely illegal; the Secretariat calls on all Afro-Asian journalists and writers, as well as the people of all countries, to resolutely unite around the banner of the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing, and thoroughly crush those splitters.
    The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association is convinced that the upcoming Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Meeting will achieve great success and make a significant contribution to strengthening the victorious advance of the people of Afro-Asian countries against their common enemy—imperialism led by the United States.

    亚非记协书记处发表声明支持亚非作家紧急会议
    加强亚非真正的反帝阵线
    彻底粉碎苏联分裂主义者
    新华社二十三日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天发表声明，热烈欢迎和完全支持即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议。声明指出，苏联分裂主义者及其追随者在开罗组织非法会议来分裂亚非作家紧急会议的企图和这个分裂会议通过的所谓“决议”，是无耻的罪恶行动，是完全非法的，是同亚非作家和亚非人民的革命运动完全敌对的，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处表示强烈谴责。
    “亚非新闻工作者协会支持亚非作家紧急会议和谴责苏联分裂主义者的声明”的全文如下：
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处热烈欢迎和完全支持即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议。
    目前，美国侵略者尽管大量集中武装部队和“逐步升级”，但是在越南人民进行坚决和有力的斗争的情况下，美国侵略者在越南遭到了一个又一个的失败。他们在越南的侵略计划面临彻底失败的阴暗前景，因此加紧推行扩大战争和“和谈”的两面手法，拼命企图吓唬和欺骗越南人民，要使他们放弃坚决的斗争。
    反帝的亚非新闻工作者深信，爱好自由的越南人民将继续战斗，给美国侵略军、仆从军和伪军以更沉重的打击，直到把他们全部消灭和赶出越南为止。亚非新闻工作者准备同英雄的越南人民一道，揭露和粉碎他们的一切企图和阴谋，以及他们的“和谈”骗局。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处将竭尽全力支持亚非作家紧急会议，在鼓舞越南人民对美国侵略者进行毫不妥协的坚决斗争和动员亚非人民给予英雄的越南人民以更广泛和更强有力的支持方面，取得巨大的成功。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处强烈谴责苏联的假革命者纠集一小撮追随者，在开罗组织一个非法会议来分裂亚非作家紧急会议的恶毒企图。苏联的假革命者声称自己是亚非人民的朋友，叫嚷反帝“联合行动”，扬言自己是“坚决支持”越南人民的。但是，在实际上，他们一直在竭尽全力制止越南人民的斗争，叫喊“这场战争有发展成为全球原子战争的危险”，等等，并施加压力，以便同美国的约翰逊政府紧密勾结设法实现“和谈”。他们目前破坏亚非作家紧急会议的活动再一次证明，他们是直接对抗亚非作家和人民的利益的。亚非作家和人民热烈响应在北京举行紧急会议，以讨论支持越南人民的办法。
    苏联的分裂主义者甚至走得那么远，竟然在他们的“开罗会议”上炮制出一项决议，“罢免”亚非作家常设局的合法秘书长森纳那亚克先生，并把常设局会址从科伦坡迁往开罗，而且要在苏联的巴库举行他们的非法的“亚非作家会议”。这是分裂主义的无耻的罪恶行动，是同亚非作家和亚非人民的革命运动完全敌对的。
    每当人民运动蓬勃发展而压倒美帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计的时候，亚非人民的那些假朋友、美帝国主义者的真正合作者便出来进行分裂勾当。但是，正如他们以前企图分裂日本人民的
  “禁止原子弹氢弹”运动而终于遭到可耻的惨败一样，他们利用象阿里芬·贝之流的一小撮反动派作为他们的工具来分裂亚非作家的运动和亚非新闻工作者的团结的新的罪恶企图，也是注定要遭到更加可耻的失败的。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处认为，揭露苏联分裂主义者及其合作者的罪恶行动和给予他们以打击，根本不意味着削弱我们的广泛的真正的反帝战线，而是将大大加强反帝战线，从而扩大我们反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处宣告，即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议是唯一合法的会议，它是根据亚非作家常设局及其秘书长的决定召集的；书记处坚决谴责苏联分裂主义者及其追随者的企图是罪恶的和反人民的，是完全非法的；书记处号召所有的亚非新闻工作者和作家以及各国人民，坚决团结在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的旗帜的周围，并彻底粉碎那些分裂主义者。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处深信，即将举行的亚非作家紧急会议将取得巨大的成功，并对加强亚非各国人民反对他们的共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义——的胜利进军作出重大贡献。
