    Learn in Practice, Apply in Struggle
    Commander of a certain regiment, Wang Gong
    To reform their ideology, leading cadres must, together with the masses, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn in actual struggle, and take the masses as teachers; they must reform in actual struggle and be supervised by the masses.
    I was originally illiterate. After the national victory, I started to learn some culture. I only began to study Chairman Mao's works more seriously from 1963 onwards. However, at that time, my work style was not thorough, I was floating in the office, and my study was not closely integrated with my own thinking and work. Although I remembered some of what Chairman Mao said, I didn't apply it very well. Later, I changed my past work style, went deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, and creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together with the masses in the practice of struggle. I tasted the sweetness and achieved relatively obvious results. As Chairman Mao taught: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and close contact with workers and peasants, can one truly learn."
    To study Chairman Mao's works and reform one's ideology, one must first find the problems in one's own thinking in order to be able to study with a definite target and with specific issues in mind. How to discover one's own problems? My experience is: one must test oneself in actual struggle and ask the masses to help find the "target."
    In the past, I was in the office, transmitting instructions from above and below, holding meetings to make arrangements. I felt that I was never idle and that I was doing okay. Later, as soon as I went deep into the grassroots and into contact with reality, I immediately discovered that my thinking was not right. Our regimental headquarters was stationed at an altitude of 3,800 meters, and I felt inconvenienced to move around, had headaches and shortness of breath. The food we ate was cooked in pressure cookers, and we still felt it was difficult to digest after drinking red tea after meals. However, when I looked at the soldiers, they were working at an altitude of 4,500 meters. The pressure cookers in the companies were not enough, and they often ate undercooked rice. Many soldiers were not adapting to the environment. Even under these circumstances, they persisted in carrying soil and hammering, and their labor morale was still very high.
    Seeing these situations, I was both moved and ashamed. In particular, seeing some problems that urgently needed to be solved and could be solved, we did not solve them in time, which added to the difficulties of the soldiers, and I could not calm down. I studied articles such as "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods" and "Serve the People" with these problems in mind, and I felt that they were more intimate than when I studied them in the past, and my understanding was also more concrete and profound. I thought of the past, when I was a grassroots cadre in the difficult years of the war, living and fighting with the soldiers, and caring more about the soldiers. Why am I not as good as I used to be now? The reason is that I have lived a peaceful life for too long, and I have become a bigger "official." Not only am I far away from the masses in my life, but more importantly, I am far away from the masses in my feelings and thinking. My class feelings for the soldiers are not as deep as they used to be.
    In the past, the leadership criticized me for my simple and crude management and education methods, and I didn't pay much attention to it, thinking that it was right to be strict. When I got to the grassroots, I heard some soldiers say: "The regimental commander is a very good person, but we are afraid of him yelling (losing his temper)." My thinking was shaken. Chairman Mao said that the effect is the criterion for testing the motive. The soldiers are afraid of me, which shows that there is a problem with my thinking. I studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind again. I thought, I am prone to losing my temper with subordinates and soldiers, but I dare not do so with superiors, which shows that this is not simply a matter of temper, but that I still have an unequal attitude towards soldiers and subordinates in politics, and this is also a matter of class feelings.
    In actual struggle, among the masses, I more clearly realized the problems in my own thinking and enhanced my consciousness of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to reform my ideology. How to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works to reform one's ideology? My experience is that one must still learn in actual struggle and take the masses as teachers.
    Chairman Mao said, "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning." One must repeatedly study and repeatedly use in practice in order to gradually and deeply understand Chairman Mao's words. Last year, our regiment undertook an arduous construction task and encountered many difficulties. Whenever we encountered difficulties, we studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with problems in mind. Each time we learned, we had new gains and new experiences.
    In the hot mass struggle, the revolutionary enthusiasm and excellent qualities of the masses are constantly infecting and educating me. When building roads in the plateau, one night I was very tired and stayed in the tent of the management platoon. It started to rain at night, and I didn't notice it. When I woke up in the morning, I found that my quilt was covered with the cook's oilcloth, while his own quilt was completely wet. Another time, I passed through a cliff seventy or eighty meters long, with a torrent below, with no road at all. In some places, I could barely stand on half a foot, and a steel cable was pulled on the cliff for support. When I reached the middle, I suddenly felt dizzy. At this critical moment, a squad leader unhesitatingly walked over, held me with one hand, and held the steel cable with the other, risking his life to carry me over. This profound class feeling of the soldiers deeply moved and educated me. "We have all come together from all corners of the country for a common revolutionary goal." When I studied Chairman Mao's teachings again, I felt particularly intimate, which further enhanced my class feelings for the soldiers.
    Ideological reform is a long-term process. The correction of a shortcoming is not a matter of a day or two. My experience is that in order to make faster progress, one must also reform in actual struggle and let the masses supervise.
    My simple and crude shortcomings in management and education have been constantly recognized through the study of Chairman Mao's works. However, it is still sometimes exposed in work. How to deal with this situation? Should I shrink back and not manage what should be managed, or should I face reality and improve in the process of bold management? I think that the reason why the problem is repeated is mainly that the ideological problem has not been completely solved. Wrapping up the problem is not a fundamental solution. One must not be afraid of problems in actual work, and one must not be afraid of exposing shortcomings in front of the masses, and let the masses help and supervise oneself to correct them. Once, I was rude to a company commander, and my criticism was a bit barbed. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I took the initiative to apologize to the company commander. Not long after, I lost my temper with a soldier again and criticized the soldier to the point of crying. Afterwards, I realized that I was wrong and should apologize, but my ideological struggle was even more intense. It is relatively easy to apologize to a cadre, but will apologizing to a soldier affect my prestige? I felt embarrassed. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings again: "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing us if we have shortcomings." I made up my mind not only to apologize to the soldier himself, but also to apologize to the entire company during the evening roll call. This soldier never checked his own shortcomings in the past, but this time he was also moved and took the initiative to check. As a result, the feelings between the leadership and the masses became closer, and the prestige of the leadership was also improved. Turning one's problems over to the masses can better obtain the supervision of the masses and enhance one's determination to correct shortcomings.
    Through my own personal experience, I have more deeply realized that reading behind closed doors, with theory divorced from practice, is not a good way to study Chairman Mao's works. It is also wrong to think that going to the troops is mainly to reform others, and going home is to reform oneself. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the thought that guides the Chinese and the people of the world in making revolution, so one must go to revolutionary practice to learn, go to the hot mass struggle to learn, and transform the subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world. Chairman Mao pointed out in "Reform Our Study": "We must abolish the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in isolation." I am determined to do better in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.

### 在实践中学　在斗争中用

    在实践中学　在斗争中用
    某团团长　王功
    领导干部改造思想，也要和群众一起，活学活用毛主席著作，在实际斗争中学习，拜群众做老师；在实际斗争中改造，让群众来监督。
    我原来是文盲，全国胜利后，开始学了点文化。从一九六三年开始，才比较认真地学习毛主席著作。但是，那时我的作风不深入，浮在机关，学习没有和自己的思想、工作紧密结合起来，虽然记住了毛主席讲的一些话，用得却不太好。后来，我改变了过去的作风，深入基层，深入群众，在斗争实践中和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，尝到了甜头，取得了比较明显的效果。正如毛主席教导的：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”
    要学习毛主席著作改造思想，首先要找到自己思想上的毛病，才能做到有的放矢带着问题学。怎样发现自己的问题呢？我体会到：要在实际斗争中检验，请群众帮助找“靶子”。
    过去，我在机关，上传下达，开会布置，自己觉得反正没闲着，还过得去。后来，一深入基层，一接触实际，就立即发现了自己的思想不对头。我们团部驻地拔海三千八百米，就觉得行动不便，头痛气喘；吃的饭是用高压锅煮的，饭后还要喝红茶，仍觉得不好消化。可是，看看战士，他们施工的地方海拔四千五百米，连里高压锅不够用，经常吃夹生饭，许多战士身体不适应。就是在这种情况下，他们坚持挑土、打锤，劳动情绪还很高。
    看到这些情况，我又感动，又惭愧。特别是看到一些急需解决而且可以解决的问题，我们没有及时解决，给战士增加了困难，心里平静不下来。我带着这些问题，学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《为人民服务》等文章，觉得比过去学习时更亲切，理解也具体深刻得多了。我联想到过去，在艰苦的战争年代里，自己是基层干部，和战士生活在一起，战斗在一起，对战士比较关心，为什么现在反而不如过去了呢？原因就在于，和平生活过得久了，“官”当得大了，不仅生活上和群众离得远了，更重要的是思想感情上和群众离得远了。对战士的阶级感情，不如过去那样深厚了。
    过去，领导上曾经批评我管教方法有些简单粗暴，我还不大在意，认为自己严格要求还是对的。到了基层，听到有的战士反映：“团长人很好，就是怕他叫起来（发脾气）。”我思想上有了震动。毛主席说过，效果是检验动机的标准。战士怕我，就说明我思想上有问题。我又带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。我想，我对下级和战士容易发脾气，而对上级就不敢，说明这不单纯是脾气问题，而是自己对待战士和下级，在政治上还有不平等态度，这也是一个阶级感情问题。
    在实际斗争中，在群众中，我比较清醒地认识到了自己思想上的毛病，增强了活学活用毛主席著作改造思想的自觉性。怎样活学活用毛主席著作改造思想呢？我的体会是，仍旧要在实际斗争中学习，拜群众为师。
    毛主席说，“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”必须在实践中反复学，反复用，才能逐步地深刻理解毛主席的话。去年，我们团担负一项艰巨的施工任务，遇到许多困难。每当遇到困难的时候，就带着问题学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章，学一次就有一次新的收获，新的体会。
    在火热的群众斗争中，群众的革命干劲和优秀品质，随时随地感染着自己，教育着自己。在高原修公路时，一天晚上，我很疲劳，住在管理排的帐篷里，夜里下起雨来，我没发觉。早上醒来，发现自己被子上盖着炊事班长的油布，他自己的被子却全淋湿了。又一次，我通过一条长七八十米的绝壁，脚下是急流，根本没有路，有的地方只能勉强站住半个脚掌，绝壁上拉着一条扶手通行的钢丝。我走到中间，顿时头昏眼花。在这危急时刻，一个班长毫不犹豫地走过来，一手挟着我，一手扶着钢丝，冒着生命危险，把我抱了过去。战士们这种深厚的阶级感情，深深感动和教育了我。“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”当我再次学习毛主席的这些教导时，感到格外亲切，使我进一步增强了对战士的阶级感情。
    思想改造是长期的。一个缺点的纠正，也不是一朝一夕的事。我体会到，要使自己较快地得到进步，也必须在实际斗争中改造，让群众来监督。
    我在管理教育上简单粗暴的毛病，通过学习毛主席著作，不断有所认识。但是，在工作中仍有时暴露。遇到这种情况怎么处理呢？是缩手缩脚，该管的也不管呢，还是面对现实，在大胆管理的过程中改进呢？我想，毛病所以重犯，主要是思想问题还没彻底解决。把问题包起来，不是治本的办法。要不怕在实际工作中出问题，不怕在群众面前暴露缺点，让群众来帮助和监督自己改正。有一次，我对一个连长态度粗暴，批评带了点刺。事后学习了毛主席著作，主动找连长作了检讨。不久，我又对一个战士发了脾气，把战士批评得哭起来。事后，我认识到自己的不对，应该检讨，但我的思想斗争更激烈。向一个干部检讨还比较容易，向战士检讨，会不会影响威信？觉得面子不好过。这时，我又学习了毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”我下了决心，不单向战士本人作检讨，晚点名时还向全连战士作了检讨。这个战士过去从不检查自己的缺点，这次也受到感动，主动作了检讨。这样做的结果，领导与群众的感情更亲近了，领导的威信也提高了。把自己的问题交给群众，就可以更好地得到群众的监督，增强自己改正缺点的决心。
    我通过亲身体验，更加深刻地认识到：闭门读书，理论与实际脱节，是学不好毛主席著作的。认为下部队主要是改造别人，回家才是改造自己，也是错误的。伟大的毛泽东思想，是指导全中国和全世界人民闹革命的思想，就必须到革命实践中去学，到火热的群众斗争中去学，在改造客观世界的过程中改造主观世界。毛主席在《改造我们的学习》一文中指出：要“废除静止地孤立地研究马克思列宁主义的方法。”我决心更好地按照毛主席的指示去做。
