    With Chairman Mao's Books as Instructions, We Can Withstand Even If the Sky Falls
    Herdsmen in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai Conquer Wind, Snow, and Drought, Achieving Increased Livestock Production
    (Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 12th dispatch) The vast pastoral areas of the Tibetan Plateau have thawed, and thousands of miles of grassland present a green scene. The emancipated Tibetan herdsmen, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary will of man conquering nature and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, have overcome the wind, snow, and severe cold that have been rare for decades. They have not only preserved more than 10 million head (pieces) of livestock in the region, but also won a bumper harvest during lambing season. This is a miracle in the history of Tibetan animal husbandry.
    Last winter and this spring, the main pastoral areas of Tibet experienced several heavy snowfalls in succession. Many pastures became vast snow seas, and the temperature dropped sharply to minus thirty to forty degrees Celsius. In some mountainous areas, more than one million head (pieces) of livestock were threatened by wind and snow. Such severe snow conditions have been rare in recent decades. At this critical moment, the party and government at all levels in Tibet and the leading departments of the stationed troops immediately dispatched a large number of cadres and staff members to the pastoral areas. They carried Chairman Mao's works, with deep class feelings for their herder brothers, and braved the snow and ice to come to the yurts of the herders. They studied Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" together with the herders, firming people's revolutionary will of man conquering nature. Many herdsmen learned and applied what they learned. Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and related discussions on how to correctly deal with difficulties, made people even more confident and powerful. They said: Chairman Mao's book is the sun in winter, the guiding light in the dark night. Remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, we can withstand any difficulty, no matter how great.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 12th dispatch) Herdsmen of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, after more than half a year of arduous struggle, have overcome the largest wind and snow disaster since the liberation of Xinjiang, and the region is expected to achieve another increase in livestock production.
    Since last winter, especially this spring, many pastoral areas in Xinjiang have been hit by the largest blizzard and severe cold since liberation. Heavy snow blocked the mountains and covered the ground. The snow on the winter pastures of the Tianshan grasslands and the Altay pastoral areas reached about one meter, deep to the horse's belly. Pasture grass was covered by ice and snow, which brought great difficulties to grazing livestock. In order to overcome the serious wind and snow disaster, from the Pamir Plateau to the Altay Mountains, a wind and snow line stretching thousands of kilometers, cadres of all nationalities and the broad masses of herdsmen, highlighted politics, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carried out a heroic and tenacious struggle against the disaster and to protect livestock with the fearless spirit of man conquering nature. They said: With Chairman Mao's books as instructions, we can withstand even if the sky falls!
    Since the spring thaw this year, most of the pastures in the fourteen major pastoral areas of Xinjiang have been covered with lush grass, and the large and small livestock have grown fat and strong. A prosperous scene has appeared on the various grasslands north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th dispatch) Herdsmen of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai grasslands, with a dauntless revolutionary spirit, have overcome natural disasters and won a bumper harvest of lambs. At present, lamb production in Qinghai Province has basically ended, with more than 3.6 million lambs being produced, with a survival rate of more than 80%, an increase of more than 200,000 from last year.
    Since last winter, varying degrees of snow disaster and drought have occurred in various parts of the Qinghai grasslands. The drought situation in some areas of the Haixi Mongolian Tibetan Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was relatively serious, and heavy snow disasters occurred in some areas of the Golog, Yushu, and Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures. Under these circumstances, herdsmen of all ethnic groups vigorously highlighted politics and creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They drew wisdom and strength from articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," enhancing their fighting spirit. During this period, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture alone established more than 1,580 Mao Zedong Thought study groups, and the herdsmen participating in the study accounted for one-third of the total herder population in the prefecture. After studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," they said: "The Foolish Old Man can move mountains, what are we afraid of even great wind and snow. We dare to climb even a mountain of knives!" In Ganjia County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where there was a severe drought, the herdsmen studied Chairman Mao's works and stubbornly launched a drought resistance struggle, digging eight wells and six springs in the harsh winter, which not only solved the problem of drinking water for people and animals, but also expanded the grassland utilization area by 160,000 mu. Mao Zedong Thought boosted the morale of the herdsmen of all ethnic groups and extinguished the power of natural disasters, and thus a bumper harvest of lambs was achieved in various places.
    In order to win a bumper harvest of lambs, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China extracted a group of responsible cadres from provincial-level organs to form six work teams and sent them to the six autonomous prefectures in the pastoral areas to help with their work. Leading cadres at the state, county, and township levels took Jiao Yulu as an example, carrying Chairman Mao's works and backpacks, and went to various pastures to stay at designated points, participate in production, and lead production.

### 有毛主席的书作指示，天塌下来也能顶住  西藏新疆和青海牧民降服风雪和干旱牧业增产

    有毛主席的书作指示，天塌下来也能顶住
    西藏新疆和青海牧民降服风雪和干旱牧业增产
    据新华社拉萨十二日电　西藏高原的广大牧区已经冰消雪融，千里草原呈现一片青绿色。翻身藏族牧民高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以人定胜天的革命意志和愚公移山的精神，战胜了几十年来罕见的风雪严寒，不但保住了全区一千多万头（只）牲畜，而且还在接羔时夺得了丰收。这是西藏牧业史上的一个奇迹。
    去冬今春，西藏主要牧业区接连下了几场大雪，许多牧场成了茫茫雪海，气温急剧下降到零下三四十度，有的山区受到风雪威胁的牲畜达一百多万头（只）。这样严重的雪情，是近几十年少见的。在这个紧急关头，西藏的各级党、政府和驻军领导部门，立即抽调大批干部和工作人员分赴牧区。他们带着毛主席著作，怀着对牧民兄弟的深厚阶级感情，踏雪履冰，来到牧民的帐篷里，和牧民们一道学习《愚公移山》等毛主席著作，坚定人们人定胜天的革命意志。许多牧民学一点用一点，毛主席的《愚公移山》和有关怎样正确对待困难的论述，使得人们更加增强了信心和力量。他们说：毛主席的书是冬天的太阳，是黑夜里的指路明灯，记住毛主席的教导，天大的困难也顶得住。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐十二日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各民族牧民，高举毛泽东思想红旗，经过半年多的艰苦奋斗，战胜了新疆解放以来最大的一次风雪灾害，全区可望再一次获得牧业增产。
    去冬以来，特别是今年春季，新疆许多牧区遭到解放以来最大的暴风雪和严寒的侵袭。大雪封山盖地，天山草原和阿勒泰牧区冬牧场的积雪达一米左右，深及马腹，牧草被冰雪覆盖，给放牧牲畜带来很大困难。为了战胜严重的风雪灾害，从帕米尔高原到阿勒泰山区绵延数千公里的风雪线上，各民族干部和广大牧民群众突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以人定胜天的大无畏精神，开展了英勇顽强的抗灾保畜斗争。他们说：有毛主席的书作指示，天塌下来我们也能顶住！
    今年春暖雪消以来，新疆全区十四个主要牧区的大部分牧场都绿草如茵，大小牲畜都长得膘肥体壮，天山南北的各个草原上出现了一片兴旺景象。
    据新华社西宁十二日电　青海草原各族牧民以大无畏的革命精神，战胜自然灾害，夺得了羊羔丰收。现在，青海全省的羊羔生产已经基本结束，共产羊羔三百六十多万只，成活率在百分之八十以上，比去年增产二十多万只。
    去年冬季以来，青海草原各地都发生了不同程度的雪灾、旱情。海西蒙古族藏族哈萨克族自治州和海北藏族自治州部分地区旱情比较严重，果洛、玉树、海南三个藏族自治州的部分地区大雪成灾。在这种情况下，各族牧民大力突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。他们从《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章里，吸取了智慧和力量，增强了斗志。这期间，仅玉树藏族自治州就成立了一千五百八十多个毛主席著作学习小组，参加学习的牧民，占全州牧民总人口三分之一。他们在学习了“老三篇”以后说：“愚公能移山，我们还怕什么大风大雪。就是刀山也敢上！”在严重干旱的海北藏族自治州刚察县吉尔孟乡，牧民们学习毛主席著作，顽强地展开抗旱斗争，在三九寒天打井八眼，挖泉六处，不但解决了人畜饮水问题，还扩大了草原利用面积十六万亩。毛泽东思想长了各族牧民的志气，灭了自然灾害的威风，各地从而夺得羊羔丰收。
    为夺取羊羔丰收，中共青海省委从省级机关抽掉了一批负责干部，组成六个工作组，派往牧区的六个自治州去帮助工作。各州、县、乡的领导干部以焦裕禄为榜样，带上毛主席著作，背着背包，到各个牧场蹲点，参加生产，领导生产。
