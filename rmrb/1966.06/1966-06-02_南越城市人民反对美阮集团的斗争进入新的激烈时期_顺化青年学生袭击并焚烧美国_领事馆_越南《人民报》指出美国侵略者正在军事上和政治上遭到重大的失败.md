    Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Saigon: Youth and students in Hue, in the U.S.-puppet-controlled region of South Vietnam, attacked and burned the U.S. "Consulate" on the 1st, strongly protesting against the U.S. support for the Nguyen Cao Ky military dictatorial regime.

    According to Western news agencies, at approximately 11:00 AM on the 1st, around one thousand students marched towards the U.S. "Consulate" after holding a rally at Hue University. Disregarding the suppression by puppet military and police, they violently attacked the two-story building with stones and stormed into the "Consulate," tearing down and smashing the portraits of U.S. President Johnson hanging on the walls. Following this, they set fire to the building and the adjacent U.S. personnel dormitory. When the students broke into the U.S. "Consulate," some Americans from the "Consulate" hurriedly fled to the heavily guarded offices of the U.S. "Advisory Group."

    This is the second attack on U.S. institutions by Hue youth and students within a week. On May 26th, Hue students attacked and burned the U.S. Information Service library, protesting against the Johnson administration's support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

    Buddhists and the masses in Saigon and other places continue to hold demonstrations against the U.S.-puppet clique. On May 31st, another four hundred youths in Saigon took to the streets with banners opposing the Nguyen Cao Ky clique and their American masters. From May 29th to May 31st, five nuns, monks, and Buddhists in Saigon, Hue, and Da Lat successively set themselves on fire to protest against U.S. support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

    In the face of further escalation of mass demonstrations in enemy-occupied cities in South Vietnam against the U.S.-puppet clique, the Nguyen Cao Ky clique held negotiations with leaders of various Buddhist sects on May 31st. According to Western news agencies, these negotiations "yielded no results." The next day, Thich Thien Minh, who participated in the negotiations, was suddenly stabbed on a Saigon street and seriously injured.

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th Dispatch from Saigon: Saigon and Hue, where demonstrations against the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky clique and its American masters have erupted in recent days, saw strikes and market shutdowns on the 30th, and the situation remains very tense.

    According to Western news agencies, following a nun's self-immolation in Hue on the morning of the 29th to protest against U.S. support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique, a young Buddhist woman in Saigon also committed suicide by self-immolation on the evening of the 29th. This incident reflects the growing anti-American sentiment among Buddhists and the masses in Saigon. On the 30th, many more students took to the streets of Saigon to demonstrate. At the same time, many shops and vendors in Saigon responded to the call of the Buddhists and staged a market shutdown.

    In Hue, students held a rally on the morning of the 29th and drafted an ultimatum to U.S. President Johnson, demanding that he publicly revoke U.S. support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique within 48 hours, or else they would burn down the U.S. Consulate in Hue. On the 30th, Hue workers responded to the "Struggle Committee's" call for a strike. It is reported that not a single South Vietnamese employee is working at the U.S. military headquarters. Many restaurant waiters have refused to serve Americans.

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch from Hanoi: The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published a commentary on May 31st on the struggle of the urban people of South Vietnam, pointing out that the struggle of the people in the southern cities of Vietnam against the United States and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique has entered a new intense period.

    The commentary said that the bloody crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique in Da Nang, Hue, and Saigon have fully exposed their ferocious nature and the despicable face of the U.S. aggressors. Johnson, Lodge, and Westmoreland superficially talk about "non-interference" and stage a farce of "reconciliation" between the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the opposition, but in essence, they are advising the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique and helping it to suppress the people and the opposition.

    The commentary pointed out that the actions of the U.S. aggressors clearly expose their ambition to maintain the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique by force and other brutal and shameless means to serve the U.S. aggressive conspiracy. The so-called "National Political Congress," "Military and Civilian Congress," and "Reconciliation" tricks played by the United States and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique are nothing but delaying tactics at different times to gradually eliminate various opposition factions and suppress the mass struggle movement by force.

    The commentary pointed out that in the fierce struggle of the urban people in the South, people like Thich Tam Chau, who wear the guise of leaders opposing the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique but actually take the despicable act of surrendering to them, were exposed, as were other opposition leaders who wanted to rely on the United States to oppose the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique or followed U.S. instructions to "compromise" with the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. The situation in the past period has shown that, except for a small number of opposition leaders who wavered, surrendered, and "compromised" with the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, the urban people in the South, patriotic people in the puppet army and puppet regime, and the majority of Buddhists hate the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. The spearhead of their struggle is increasingly clearly directed at the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

    The commentary said that the more the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique strengthen their suppression, the more intense the struggle against them by the people and opposition in the South. This struggle is irreconcilable. The U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique are suffering major defeats militarily and politically and will certainly be completely defeated.

    南越城市人民反对美阮集团的斗争进入新的激烈时期
    顺化青年学生袭击并焚烧美国“领事馆”
    越南《人民报》指出美国侵略者正在军事上和政治上遭到重大的失败
    新华社一日讯　西贡消息：南越美伪统治区顺化市青年学生一日袭击并焚烧了美国“领事馆”，强烈抗议美国支持阮高其军事独裁政权。
    据西方通讯社报道，一日上午十一时左右，大约一千名学生在顺化大学举行集会后，浩浩荡荡走向美国“领事馆”。他们不顾伪军警的镇压，用石块猛烈袭击这座两层楼的建筑物，并且冲入“领事馆”，把挂在墙上的美国总统约翰逊的画象扯下来撕得粉碎。接着，他们放火焚烧了这座建筑物和隔壁的美国人员宿舍。当学生们冲进美国“领事馆”时，“领事馆”的一些美国人急忙逃到了由重兵防守的美国“顾问团”的办事处去。
    这是在一个星期内顺化青年学生对美国机构进行的第二次袭击。五月二十六日，顺化学生就曾袭击并焚烧了美国新闻处图书馆，抗议约翰逊政府对阮高其集团的支持。
    西贡等地的佛教徒和群众继续举行反对美伪集团的示威游行。五月三十一日，西贡市又有四百名青年高举反对阮高其集团及其美国主子的标语牌上街示威。从五月二十九日到三十一日，在西贡、顺化和大叻三个城市内，先后已有五个尼姑、和尚和佛教徒引火自焚，抗议美国支持阮高其集团。
    在南越敌占城市群众反对美伪集团的示威进一步高涨的情况下，阮高其集团五月三十一日同佛教各派头目举行了谈判。据西方通讯社报道，这次谈判“没有取得任何结果”。第二天，参加这次谈判的释善明突然在西贡大街上被刺，并受了重伤。
    据新华社三十日讯　西贡消息：在连日来爆发反对南越傀儡阮高其集团及其美国主子示威的西贡和顺化，三十日爆发了罢市和罢工斗争，局势仍然十分紧张。
    据西方通讯社报道，继二十九日上午一个尼姑在顺化自焚以抗议美国支持阮高其集团之后，二十九日晚西贡市一个佛教徒女青年又焚身自杀。这一事件反映了西贡佛教徒和群众日益增长的反美情绪。三十日，又有许多学生走上西贡街头示威。同时，西贡市的许多店铺和摊贩响应佛教徒的号召，举行了罢市。
    在顺化，在二十九日上午，学生们举行集会，草拟了给美国总统约翰逊的最后通牒，要求他在四十八小时内公开撤销美国对阮高其集团的支持，否则要烧毁顺化的美国领事馆。三十日，顺化工人响应了“斗争委员会”的罢工号召。据报道，已经没有一个南越职工在美军总部工作。许多饭店的侍者都拒绝招待美国人。
    据新华社河内一日电　越南《人民报》五月三十一日就南越城市人民的斗争发表评论指出，越南南方城市人民反对美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团的斗争已经进入了一个新的激烈时期。
    评论说，美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团在岘港、顺化和西贡犯下的血腥罪行，完全暴露了它们的凶恶本质，暴露了美国侵略者的卑鄙面目。约翰逊、洛奇、威斯特摩兰表面上说什么“不干涉”，在阮文绍—阮高其集团和反对派之间导演“和解”的丑剧，而实质上它却为阮文绍—阮高其集团出谋划策，帮助它镇压人民和反对派。
    评论指出，美国侵略者的行径清楚地暴露了它的野心，它企图用武力以及其它凶暴和无耻的手段，来维持阮文绍—阮高其集团，为美国的侵略阴谋服务。美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团玩弄的那些所谓“全国政治代表大会”、“军民代表大会”、“和解”等把戏，只不过是一些不同时候的缓兵计，以逐步消灭各个反对派和用武力镇压群众的斗争运动。
    评论指出，在南方城市人民的激烈斗争中，暴露了如释心珠等穿着反对阮文绍—阮高其集团首领外衣、而实际上采取投降它们的卑贱行径的人，也暴露了其它一些反对派头目想依靠美国来反对阮文绍—阮高其集团，或听从美国的指使想同阮文绍—阮高其集团“妥协”。过去期间的形势表明，除了一小部分动摇、投降和同阮文绍—阮高其集团“妥协”的反对派头目之外，南方城市人民、伪军和伪政权里具有爱国心的人和大部分佛教徒都仇恨美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团。他们斗争的锋芒日益明确地指向美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团。
    评论说，美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团越加强镇压，南方人民和反对派对它们进行的斗争就越激烈。这场斗争是不可调和的。美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团正在军事和政治上遭到大败，并且一定会遭到彻底失败。
