    Comrade Lin Biao's Letter on the Industrial and Transportation Front's Creative Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works Points Out:
    Chairman Mao Has Geniusly Elevated Marxism-Leninism to a Brand New Stage; Mao Zedong Thought Inculcated Among Workers and Peasants Can Be Transformed into Tremendous Material Strength
    The emphasis on putting politics in command and highlighting politics by the industrial and transportation system is very good. This practice is of great benefit to raising the political consciousness of the working class and strengthening China's socialist construction. Doing so will further enhance the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and make our socialist cause even more prosperous. It is very good that you have made studying Chairman Mao's works the first item of the overall work policy of the industrial and transportation system.
    Our country is a great socialist country with the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million, and needs a unified thought, revolutionary thought, and correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought. With this thought, we can maintain vigorous revolutionary drive and have a firm and correct political direction.
    Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of domestic and international class struggle and the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people. Mao Zedong Thought was not spontaneously generated by the working people, but was geniusly inherited and developed by Chairman Mao on the basis of great revolutionary practice. It is a synthesis of the new experiences of the international communist movement and elevates Marxism-Leninism to a brand new stage.
    Therefore, it is necessary to transform the mental outlook of the laboring people, and only by vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and inculcating Chairman Mao's thought into the workers and peasants, can we transform spiritual power into tremendous material strength.
    In recent years, the industrial and transportation system has begun to do so. This meeting of the industrial and transportation system has summarized experience and proposed new approaches, which will surely achieve further results. 		Lin Biao	 March 11, 1966

    林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信中指出
    毛主席天才地把马克思列宁主义提高到崭新的阶段  毛泽东思想灌输到工农中去能转化为巨大物质力量
    工交系统强调政治挂帅，突出政治，这种做法很好，对于提高工人阶级的政治觉悟，加强我国社会主义建设，都是有很大益处的。这样做，会进一步提高工人阶级的积极性和创造性，使我们的社会主义事业更加兴旺。你们把大学毛主席著作做为工交系统全部工作方针的第一项，很好。
    我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。
    毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的，而是毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义的思想，是综合了国际共产主义运动的新经验，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    因此，必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。
    近几年来，工交系统开始这样做了，这次工交系统的会议，又总结了经验，提出了新的做法，定会进一步取得成效。		林彪	 一九六六年三月十一日
