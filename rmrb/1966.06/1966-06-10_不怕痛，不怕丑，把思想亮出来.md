    Don't Fear Pain, Don't Fear Ugliness, Reveal Your Thoughts
    Political Commissar of an Engineering Regiment, Zhou Zhizhong
    To transform one's ideology is to wage a revolution against oneself; this is a struggle. To win this struggle, we must mobilize the masses, expose our "targets" to the masses, and seek their help. We must have a spirit of courage, dare to engage in fierce combat, and have a revolutionary demeanor. When leading cadres set an example in ideological transformation, they will not lose their leadership prestige.
    To transform our ideology, we must reveal our erroneous thoughts. In the course of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, I have come to realize more and more deeply that: wanting to change but not daring to "reveal" is actually not wanting to change.
    I have been in the army for twenty-seven years and a regiment cadre for fifteen years. I often regard myself as old and think that I am "old" and should find a place to settle down. I often worry about this, and there is ideological struggle, but because I have not boldly "revealed" it, there has not been much improvement.
    In the first half of last year, the Kunming Military Region promoted the experience of a certain division in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works by "revealing targets," which greatly inspired me. I realized that to solve my ideological problems, I must first put the problems out in the open and combine my own efforts to change with everyone's help to change. To get everyone's help, I must first "reveal" myself, but I hesitated. "Reveal" it! If people hear it, they'll say, "Ah! You're the political commissar, and the political commissar has these problems!" Wouldn't that cause my prestige to plummet? After thinking it over and over, I didn't have the courage, so I decided to change quietly on my own. However, changing quietly doesn't actually work.
    Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao taught us: "If there are mistakes, publicly admitting them is a mistake." I carefully pondered the meaning of Chairman Mao's words and realized that whether or not you dare to "reveal" is essentially a question of whether or not you want to change. Transforming ideology is also a revolution, and to make revolution, we must mobilize the masses, have a spirit of courage, and not fear pain or ugliness. If we are afraid of this and that even in transforming our ideology, how can we not fear hardship and death in making revolution? Thinking of this, my mind suddenly cleared. At an enlarged Party committee meeting, I thoroughly examined my erroneous thoughts of seeking comfort, being concerned about fame and status, and considering my personal future, and humbly accepted everyone's criticism. This examination made me realize that: the process of "revealing" is a process of ideological struggle, and it is also a process of transforming ideology and raising awareness. To "reveal," one cannot avoid blushing and one's heart beating faster, but after "revealing," one feels as relaxed and happy as if one has put down a burden.
    Ideological transformation is not a matter of one morning or evening. It requires repeated struggle, so it requires repeated "revealing." Chairman Mao taught us: "The thoughts of our comrades, and the work of our Party, will also be stained with dust and should also be swept and washed." I thought that I had "revealed" it at the enlarged Party committee meeting, but that was not enough. I must often sweep and often wash; I must also let the masses help sweep and help wash in order to change faster and more thoroughly. Later, whenever the regiment's leading comrades had heart-to-heart talks or organizational life meetings, whenever there was an opportunity, I would examine myself and repeatedly solicit the opinions of my comrades. I "revealed" within the Party, and I also "revealed" outside the Party; I "revealed" to superiors and peers, and I also "revealed" to subordinates and the masses. Over the past year, I have repeatedly examined my thinking at various meetings, placing my problems before everyone. Practice has proven that when a leading cadre "reveals" their ideological bottom line to everyone, not only will they not lose prestige, but their prestige will be even higher, everyone will respect me more, and my feelings with everyone will be even closer. With everyone's help, I gradually overcame the individualism of considering my personal future, and realized that making revolution is the same whether in the city or in the countryside. How many times can one strive in life? Now the burden of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution is on our shoulders, and being able to contribute our strength to the revolution forever is the greatest happiness. My mood is relaxed, and my enthusiasm for work has also increased. Since last year, although our regiment has been scattered along a line of more than one hundred and seventy kilometers to carry out tasks, I have traveled over mountains and ridges, gone deep into the front lines, and gone to the companies to inspect and help with work, and I have never felt tired.

    不怕痛，不怕丑，把思想亮出来
    某工程团政委　周致忠
    改造思想就是要革自己的命，这是一场斗争。要取得这场斗争的胜利，就要发动群众，向群众亮“靶子”，争取群众的帮助。就要有勇敢精神，敢于刺刀见红，要有个革命的样子。领导干部在思想改造上做出样子来，决不会丧失领导的威信。
    改造思想，就要把自己的错误思想亮出来。我在活学活用毛主席著作中，越来越深刻地体会到：想改又不敢“亮”，实际上还是不想改。
    我参军二十七年了，团的干部当了十五年，常常以老自居，认为自己“老”了，该找个归宿了。我也常为此苦恼，思想有斗争，但因为没有大胆地“亮”，所以改进不大。
    去年上半年，昆明部队推广了某师活学活用毛主席著作“亮靶子”的经验，给我很大启示，认识到要解决自己的思想问题，就必须首先把问题摆出来，把自己改和大家帮助改结合起来。要大家帮，就得自己先“亮”，我犹豫起来了。“亮”吧！叫人家一听：“啊！你是政委，政委还有这些问题呀！”这一下不就威信扫地了吗？我思前想后，没有这个勇气，还是自己悄悄改吧。可是，悄悄改，实际上改不了。
    后来，我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，毛主席教导我们：“有错误就公开讲出是错误。”我仔细琢磨毛主席这段话的意思，认识到敢不敢“亮”，实质上就是想不想改的问题。改造思想也是一场革命，要革命，就要发动群众，就要有勇敢精神，就要不怕痛，不怕丑。连改造思想都怕这怕那，干革命怎能不怕苦、不怕死。想到这里，思想豁然开朗。在一次党委扩大会上，我原原本本地检查了自己贪图安逸，计较名利地位和考虑个人归宿等错误思想，虚心接受大家的批评。这次检查，使我体会到：“亮”的过程，就是思想斗争的过程，也是改造思想，提高觉悟的过程。要“亮”，有时免不了要脸红一些，心跳一些，而在“亮”了以后，就象放下一个包袱那样轻松愉快，心情舒畅了。
    思想改造不是一朝一夕的事，要经过反复斗争，就要反复地“亮”。毛主席教导我们：“我们同志的思想，我们党的工作，也会沾染灰尘的，也应该打扫和洗涤。”我想在党委扩大会上“亮”了，这还不够，还要经常打扫，经常洗涤；还要让群众帮助打扫，帮助洗涤，才能改得更快更彻底。以后，每当团的领导同志交心通气，过组织生活，只要有机会，我就检查检查，反复征求同志们的意见。我在党内“亮”，在党外也“亮”；给上级、同级“亮”，还给下级、群众
  “亮”。一年来，在各种会议上，我多次检查了自己思想，把问题摆在大家面前。实践证明了，一个领导干部向大家“亮”了思想底，不仅不会失去威信，而且威信更高了，大家更尊重我了，我和大家的感情也更密切了。在大家的帮助下，我逐渐克服了考虑个人归宿的个人主义思想，认识到在城市和在乡村都是闹革命。人生能有几次搏，现在中国革命和世界革命的重担，挑在我们肩上，能永远为革命贡献自己的力量，就是最大的幸福。我的心情舒畅了，工作劲头也提起来了。去年以来，我们团虽然分散在一百七十多公里的线上执行任务，我翻山越岭，深入现场，到连队检查帮助工作，从不觉得劳累。
