    Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: The Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a banquet this evening to welcome the acrobatic troupe from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by Su Hai.

    Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Xiannian, attended the banquet.

    The Vietnamese cultural delegation, led by Phạm Ngọc Thuần, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was invited to attend the banquet.

    Vice Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Yang Chun, spoke at the banquet. She said that the people of the world are currently engaged in fierce struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The struggles of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries cannot change their fate of utter failure. She said that modern revisionism, with the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party at its core, has degenerated into traitors to Marxism-Leninism, acting as accomplices of U.S. imperialism and willingly serving U.S. imperialism everywhere. On the Vietnam issue, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party actively coordinate with the U.S. imperialists' peace talks schemes, engaging in various despicable activities. She emphasized that to achieve complete victory against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, revolutionary people around the world must simultaneously oppose modern revisionism.

    Yang Chun continued, saying that our country is currently carrying out a vigorous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a struggle against and to prevent the restoration of capitalism in China, a struggle to sweep away all monsters and demons and to touch people's souls, a struggle to dig up the roots of revisionism, and a great revolutionary movement to defend Mao Zedong Thought and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. This struggle is not only a matter of paramount importance concerning the future and destiny of our Chinese party and country, but also a matter of paramount importance concerning the world revolution, and will have immeasurable impact on the present and future of the world. The Chinese people are determined to carry this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has great historical significance, through to the end.

    In her speech, Yang Chun also expressed that the Chinese people firmly stand with the Vietnamese people and will fight to the end to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly drive out the American robbers.

    Su Hai, head of the acrobatic troupe from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said in his speech that the Vietnamese people have always regarded the support given by the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people in spirit and material as the greatest mobilization, encouragement, and strength. Su Hai sternly condemned the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes of frantically invading and brutally slaughtering the Vietnamese people, and exposed the U.S. imperialists' peace talk schemes. He said that relying on their unwavering determination, and with the support of 650 million brothers, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve complete victory in the anti-American struggle, South Vietnam must be liberated, and the Vietnamese nation will surely be unified.

    Su Hai also praised the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. He said that our love for the Chinese Communist Party, the fraternal Chinese people, and Chairman Mao is profound. We wish Chairman Mao and the Chinese Party and government leaders good health.

    Hoàng Bắc, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and Trần Văn Thành, Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, were also invited to attend the banquet. (Picture attached)

    越南民主共和国杂技团团长苏海在讲话中说，越南人民一贯把中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民在精神上和物质上给予的支持，视为最大的动员、鼓舞和力量。苏海严厉谴责了美帝国主义疯狂侵略和野蛮屠杀越南人民的滔天罪行，揭露美帝国主义的和谈阴谋。他说，越南人民依靠自己坚韧不拔的决心，又有六亿五千万兄弟的中国人民的支持，抗美斗争一定能取得完全的胜利，越南南方一定要解放，越南民族一定会统一。
