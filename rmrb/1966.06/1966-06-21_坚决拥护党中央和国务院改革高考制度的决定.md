    After the announcement of the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Reforming the Enrollment Examination Methods for Institutions of Higher Learning, a widespread and enthusiastic response has been seen across the country.  The broad masses of revolutionary students, education workers, workers, peasants, soldiers, and office cadres have written letters or sent telegrams to this newspaper, expressing their most sincere and warmest support for the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They unanimously believe that this decision is an important measure to thoroughly carry out the Great Cultural Revolution and completely reform our country's education system, and is another new victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for our country's education cause and a major event of global significance. Revolutionary students have been greatly encouraged, and they have expressed: they will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao, obey the needs of the Party and the people, go wherever the Party points, and vow to be successors to the proletarian revolution. We are now publishing excerpts of some of the letters and telegrams here.

    After the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to reform the college entrance examination method reached the troops, all the faculty and students of our Second Brigade were overjoyed and warmly hailed this great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    As early as twenty-six years ago, Chairman Mao instructed, "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture is the ideological preparation for the revolution before the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the general revolutionary front." However, those bourgeois "authorities" and lords, who hold leading positions in the education sector, have consistently acted according to the reactionary bourgeois education framework in order to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism, refusing to implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's education policy. They attempt to confine students to the individualistic small circle of bourgeois fame and fortune, hindering the development of students in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, and vainly attempt to turn revolutionary cultural positions into their bastions against the Party and socialism. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council completely shattered the wild ambitions of a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. We must use the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to sever their clutches, destroy all reactionary bourgeois education systems, and establish our new proletarian education system.
    
    All Faculty and Students of the Second Brigade of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army

    For more than ten years since liberation, we have been shackled by the old education system, and our schools, under this influence, have become positions for cultivating bourgeois successors, and many students have embarked on the "white and expert" road. The proposal of the students of Class 4, Senior 3 of Beijing No. 1 Girls' High School expresses the wishes of all our revolutionary teachers and students. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to reform the enrollment system is a fatal blow to the bourgeois academic lords, a great initiative with global significance to prevent revisionism and block the restoration of capitalism, and another new great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    
    All Revolutionary Teachers and Students of Yuci No. 2 Middle School, Shanxi Province

    The decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination system is a great victory for the educational revolution in our country and has great international significance. In particular, it is even more significant to compile new textbooks under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and to list Chairman Mao's works as required courses from elementary school to university. This is a fundamental measure to arm the new generation of the motherland with Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate strong successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and prevent revisionism, and we wholeheartedly support it.
    
    All Comrades of the Nanyang City Education Bureau, Henan Province

    The decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the proposal of the students of No. 1 Girls' High School and others, express our wishes, and we are determined to respond to this wise decision and revolutionary proposal with our actions. The great revolution on the education front is an important part of this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a major key to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and a major plan for cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors for thousands of years.

    Just as we are launching a vigorous Great Cultural Revolution movement, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made this wise decision, which is a great encouragement to our revolutionary leftists, adding infinite strength to us and further strengthening our determination to carry out the Great Cultural Revolution in depth, thoroughly, and completely!

    We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will surely achieve a complete and thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    Everything we have belongs to the people. We guarantee: we will resolutely obey the needs of the people, obey the allocation of the Party, and be revolutionary fine seeds. Wherever the Party sows us, we will take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit.
    
    All Senior 3 Graduates of Beijing No. 2 Middle School

    Our classmates have repeatedly raised reform opinions on the teaching system of the Conservatory of Music, requesting the school to implement a part-work and part-study system and establish a Ulan Muqi cultural work team. Who knew that our revolutionary determination and suggestions were severely obstructed and suppressed by the bourgeois royalists! Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have made a wise decision, and our revolutionary aspirations have finally been realized! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, go all out, and devote ourselves to this Cultural Revolution.
    
    All Students of Class 2, Senior 3 of the Affiliated Middle School of the China Conservatory of Music

    Most of the members and young people in our factory are students with a high school education or above. For more than ten years, the old set of teaching and enrollment systems has severely suppressed us, hindering us from truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought and preventing us from going to the three great revolutionary struggles to experience storms, see the world, and grow up. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee speaks our minds. We must make up for our lessons in the three great revolutionary struggles and in this Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely take the road of being both red and expert, and vow to be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    
    The Communist Youth League Committee of Baoji Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, Shaanxi Province

    We warmly support the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on reforming the enrollment examination methods for institutions of higher learning. The educational revolution is an important front in the class struggle in the ideological field. For more than ten years, capitalist and revisionist educational ideas, countless rules and regulations, are still very stubborn forces in the education field, and they must be completely overthrown. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought must be firmly planted in the education position. We vow to be promoters of the revolution and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    
    Teacher Training School of Fuyu County, Jilin Province

    The old college entrance examination system is like a mountain pressing down on us. It is a major obstacle to implementing the proletarian education policy and a stumbling block to cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors. It is a reactionary examination system that serves the cultivation of bourgeois successors. In the tide of the Cultural Revolution directly led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, it is truly gratifying to completely smash this old system. This is a great happy event for the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students to be liberated from the old examination system. Our Weishui Middle School is a revolutionary school in the old revolutionary base area. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in depth and thoroughly, resolutely smash all old education systems, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high on the proletarian education front.
    
    All Teachers and Students of Weishui Middle School, Jingxing, Hebei Province

    We wave our arms and cheer and resolutely support the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to thoroughly reform the enrollment examination methods for institutions of higher learning. Without destroying all the old systems, we cannot establish new systems, and we cannot completely dig out the roots of revisionism. We must take advantage of the victory of the Cultural Revolution and advance courageously.

    坚决拥护党中央和国务院改革高考制度的决定
    中共中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定公布后，全国各地普遍热烈响应。广大革命学生，教育工作者，工人，农民，战士和机关干部，纷纷写信或打电报给本报，对党中央和国务院的决定表示最真挚的、最热烈的拥护。他们一致认为，这一决定是彻底搞好文化大革命，彻底改革我国教育制度的重要措施，是伟大的毛泽东思想又一新胜利。这是我国教育事业的一个伟大胜利，也是具有世界意义的大事。革命学生受到了更大的鼓舞，他们表示：坚决听毛主席的话，服从党和人民的需要，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，誓做无产阶级革命接班人。我们现将部分信电摘要刊登在这里。
    党中央和国务院改革高等学校招考办法的决定传到部队后，我们二大队全体教职学员个个欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的这一伟大胜利。
    毛主席早在二十六年前就指示，“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”但是，那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们，把持着教育界的领导岗位，为了达到他们复辟资本主义的目的，他们始终按照反动的资产阶级教育框框办事，对毛主席的指示和党的教育方针，拒不执行。他们企图把学生束缚在资产阶级成名成家的个人主义小圈子里，阻碍学生德育、智育、体育几方面的发展，妄图把革命的文化阵地变成他们反党反社会主义的堡垒。党中央和国务院的英明决定，彻底粉碎了一小撮反党反社会主义分子的狂妄野心。我们一定要用毛泽东思想的锐利武器，斩断他们的魔爪，摧毁一切反动的资产阶级教育制度，建立起我们无产阶级新的教育制度。
    解放军某部二大队全体教职学员
    解放十几年来，我们一直被旧的教育制度束缚着手脚，我们的学校在这种影响下，成了培养资产阶级接班人的阵地，不少同学走上了“白专”道路。北京女一中高三（四）班同学的倡议，表达了我们全体革命师生的心愿。党中央和国务院改革升学制度的英明决定，是对资产阶级学阀的致命打击，是防止修正主义和堵塞资本主义复辟的具有世界意义的伟大创举，这是毛泽东思想又一新的伟大胜利。
    山西省榆次二中全体革命师生
    党中央和国务院关于改革高考制度的决定，是我国教育革命的伟大胜利，具有重大的国际意义。特别是要以毛泽东思想为指导编写新的教材，把毛主席的著作列为从小学到大学的必修课，更具有极其伟大、极其深远的意义。这是用毛泽东思想武装祖国新的一代、培养坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人、防止修正主义的根本措施，我们全心全意地拥护。
    河南省南阳市教育局全体同志
    党中央和国务院的决定和女一中等同学的倡议，表达了我们的心愿，我们决心以自己的行动响应这英明的决定和革命的倡议。教育战线上的大革命是这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的重要组成部分，是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的重大关键，是培养无产阶级革命接班人的千百年大计。
    正当我们掀起轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动的时候，党中央和国务院作出了这一英明决定，是对我们革命左派的巨大鼓舞，为我们增加了无穷的力量，更加坚定了我们把文化大革命搞深、搞透、搞彻底的决心！
    我们坚信，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，我们一定能取得无产阶级文化大革命的完全、彻底的胜利！
    我们的一切属于人民。我们保证：坚决服从人民的需要，服从党的分配，做革命的良种。党把我们撒在哪里，就在哪里生根，发芽，开花，结果。
    北京二中全体高三应届毕业生
    我们全班同学对音乐学院的教学制度曾多次提出过改革意见，要求学校实行半工半读，成立乌兰牧骑文化工作队。谁知我们的革命决心和建议却遭到了资产阶级保皇派的严重阻挠和压制！今天，党中央和毛主席作了英明的决定，我们的革命愿望终于实现了！我们一定要听毛主席的话，全力以赴，投身到这场文化大革命中。
    中国音乐学院附中高三（二）班全体同学
    我们厂大部分团员和青年是高中以上程度的学生。十多年来，旧的一套教学和升学制度严重地压制着我们，妨碍我们真正掌握毛泽东思想，阻挡我们到三大革命斗争中去经风浪，见世面，锻炼成长。党中央的英明决定，说出了我们的心里话。我们一定要在三大革命斗争中，在这场文化大革命中补好课，一定要高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决走又红又专的道路，誓作无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    共青团陕西省宝鸡氮肥厂委员会
    我们热烈拥护中共中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定。教育革命是意识形态领域里阶级斗争的一条重要战线。十几年来资本主义和修正主义的教育思想，数不清的清规戒律，仍然是教育领域里很顽固的势力，必须彻底打倒它。必须把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗牢牢地插在教育阵地上。我们誓作革命的促进派，把文化大革命进行到底。
    吉林省扶余县教师进修学校
    旧的高考制度，象一座大山压在我们头上。它是贯彻无产阶级教育方针的大障碍，是培养无产阶级革命接班人的绊脚石。它是为资产阶级培养接班人服务的反动的考试制度。在毛主席和党中央直接领导下的文化大革命的浪潮中，彻底砸烂这个旧制度，真是大快人心的事。这是广大革命师生从旧考试制度中解放出来的大喜事。我们微水中学是老革命根据地的革命学校，我们一定要听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命搞深搞透，坚决砸碎一切旧教育制度，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在无产阶级教育阵地上高高飘扬。
    河北省井陉微水中学全体师生
    我们振臂欢呼和坚决拥护中共中央和国务院彻底改革高等学校招考办法的决定。不大破一切旧制度，就不能大立新制度，就不能彻底挖掉修正主义根子。我们一定乘文化大革命之胜，奋勇前进。
