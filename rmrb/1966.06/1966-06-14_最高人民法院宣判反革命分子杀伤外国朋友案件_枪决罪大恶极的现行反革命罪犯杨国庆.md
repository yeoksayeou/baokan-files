    Supreme People's Court Pronounces Verdict on Counter-Revolutionary Killing and Wounding of Foreign Friends
    Executed the Extremely Heinous Active Counter-Revolutionary Criminal Yang Guoging
    President Yang Xiufeng announced to more than 13,000 people from all walks of life in the capital attending the sentencing rally: Both injured foreign friends have recovered their health after timely rescue and treatment; the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging’s sinister plot has failed shamefully; anyone who attempts to use this unfortunate incident to undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world will certainly not succeed.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th June. The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China held a sentencing rally this afternoon, sentencing the extremely heinous active counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging, who used a knife to kill and wound foreign friends, to death and executed him immediately.
    This is a counter-revolutionary homicide case of particularly serious importance. More than 13,000 people from all walks of life in the capital attended today's sentencing rally.
    According to the announcement made by the Supreme People's Court at the rally, the counter-revolutionary murderer Yang Guoging is from Shunyi County, Beijing, and before his arrest, lived at No. 20 Banzhang Hutong, Xuanwu District, Beijing. His family background was that of a local tyrant and landlord, and he himself was a student, currently nineteen years old. His father served as a puppet township chief and head of the Home Return Corps before liberation, and killed six revolutionary cadres and people, and was sentenced to death by the People's Court according to law in 1953. After liberation, Yang Guoging's study and labor were reasonably arranged by the People's Government, but instead of drawing a clear line with his reactionary family, he persisted in his reactionary stance and harbored deep class hatred for the Party, the government, and the people. In order to realize his counter-revolutionary revenge, at about 11:50 a.m. on April 29th this year, he broke into the Friendship Store on Dong'anmen Street, Beijing, and stabbed Mr. Bakari Traoré, the head of the Malian journalist delegation attending the Fourth Plenary Session of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, in the neck with a knife, and then stabbed Mrs. Maro, the First Secretary of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, in the face. After committing the crime, Yang Guoging fled out of the store and was captured by the masses.
    Yang Xiufeng, President of the Supreme People's Court, emphasized at the sentencing rally that the murder committed by the active counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging was by no means an accidental or isolated event, but a reflection of the current domestic class struggle. He mentioned that our country is currently facing a great upsurge of the proletarian cultural revolution. With the increasing depth of domestic class struggle, counter-revolutionary elements like Yang Guoging, who are stubbornly committed and extremely vicious, will take risks at all costs and carry out open and brutal sabotage activities. The living and shocking class struggle fully proves that Chairman Mao's theory about the existence of classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society is completely correct and extremely wise. President Yang Xiufeng urged everyone to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, raise their vigilance, and never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The sentencing rally was held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. Huge banners were hung in the venue, reading: "Thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements!" "Never forget class struggle!" "Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries!" Participants in the rally included employees of Beijing enterprises, cadres and members of suburban communes, students, street residents, cadres of central and Beijing municipal organs, and representatives of troops stationed in Beijing.
    On the rostrum were Yang Xiufeng, President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Su, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and members of the Supreme People's Court Tribunal: Xing Yimin, Presiding Judge and Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, judges Yu Tiemin and Li Yangwu, and clerk Ji Shuli.
    Kalsoum Sinenta, Counsellor of the Malian Embassy in China, Liebermann, Counsellor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, and Maro, the First Secretary of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China and relative of one of the victims, also attended the rally.
    At 3:30 p.m., Wang Demao, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, announced the start of the sentencing rally. Bailiffs escorted the counter-revolutionary murderer Yang Guoging into the venue.
    Xing Yimin, the Presiding Judge of the Tribunal, announced on behalf of the Supreme People's Court the verdict and execution of the counter-revolutionary case of Yang Guoging. He said that the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging, who persisted in his reactionary stance and harbored deep class hatred, plotted to murder personnel of foreign embassies in China and other foreign friends, in a vain attempt to "create international bloodshed," "provoke international disputes," and "damage China's international reputation." In order to achieve this sinister purpose, he went to the Bamiancao Daily Necessities Store in Dongcheng District on the morning of April 29th to buy a kitchen knife and came to the Friendship Store on Dong'anmen Street. The criminal Yang suffered from mild epilepsy, and in order to prevent the onset of the disease during the commission of the crime, he took Luminal sedative. Then he broke into the Friendship Store and stabbed two foreign friends.
    Xing Yimin finally announced: The counter-revolutionary murderer Yang Guoging is indeed extremely heinous and an incorrigible active counter-revolutionary criminal. The broad masses of the people are filled with righteous indignation and demand severe punishment. Based on Article 16 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, and with reference to the provisions of Article 7, Item 2, and Article 9, Item 4, this court sentences the counter-revolutionary murderer Yang Guoging to death and orders that he be executed immediately by shooting.
    Bailiffs then escorted the counter-revolutionary murderer Yang Guoging out of the venue to the execution ground for immediate execution by shooting.
    The verdict of the Supreme People's Court was greatly satisfying. More than 13,000 people participating in the rally raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely support the government's verdict!" "Thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements!" "Never forget class struggle!" "Consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat!" The slogans echoed through the sky for several minutes.
    Subsequently, Yang Xiufeng, President of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at the rally (full text to be published separately). He pointed out that this verdict is a powerful encouragement to the broad masses of the people and a serious blow to all kinds of class enemies. He emphasized that the people's democratic dictatorship system in our country is unprecedentedly consolidated and has infinite power. Any counter-revolutionary element who dares to carry out sabotage activities will certainly not escape the net of the people.
    When talking about the course of the incident, Yang Xiufeng told everyone that the two injured foreign friends have recovered their health after timely rescue and treatment. He once again expressed his apologies and condolences to the two foreign friends.
    Yang Xiufeng said that our country is facing a great upsurge of the proletarian cultural revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively engaged in this sharp class struggle on the political and ideological front, fiercely counterattacking the rampant attacks of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs.
    He said that in the sixteen years since liberation, our country's socialist construction has achieved brilliant achievements, the socialist revolution on all fronts has also achieved great victories, the level of awareness and organization of the broad masses of the people has been continuously improved, and the people's democratic dictatorship system is very consolidated. In the face of such great power, all monsters and demons are vulnerable to a single blow. However, the reactionary classes will not be reconciled to their demise. With the deepening of the socialist revolution, they have nowhere to hide and will inevitably carry out a desperate struggle. Yang Xiufeng said that before the reactionary classes are finally eliminated, long-term, repeated, and fierce class struggles are inevitable. As early as 1949, Chairman Mao pointed out to us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will continue to make final struggles. After the country is pacified, they will continue to engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and without doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance." Yang Xiufeng emphasized that we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Yang Xiufeng reiterated: The Party and the government have always adopted a policy of combining suppression and leniency towards reactionary forces and criminals who oppose and sabotage the socialist cause. However, in the reactionary classes, there are always some people who stubbornly resist transformation and carry out sabotage activities whenever they have the opportunity. He said that active counter-revolutionary criminals must be resolutely attacked, attacked hard, accurately, and in a timely manner.
    Yang Xiufeng said that the Party and the government have never treated the children of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the same way as these four categories of elements. We reasonably arrange their studies and work, and continuously strengthen their education and transformation, striving to get the majority of them to draw a clear line with their reactionary families and take the socialist road. In fact, many of them have made continuous progress politically and actively serve socialism in various work positions. However, among the children of the four categories of elements, there are also a few who are deeply influenced by their families, persist in the position of the reactionary class, and even participate in various sabotage activities. From Yang Guoging's family, we can see this differentiation. Yang Guoging himself was obsessed and finally embarked on a dead end. His younger brother was born in the same family, but he is a member of the Communist Youth League and chose the bright road. Yang Xiufeng said that we hope that all the children of the four categories of elements can take Yang Guoging's end as a warning, make up their minds, thoroughly transform themselves, and follow the Party and the people of the whole country on the road to socialism.
    Yang Xiufeng said that the counter-revolutionary nature of the case of active counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging killing foreign friends was originally very clear. However, some people spread rumors that this incident showed the xenophobic sentiment of the Chinese people. This is a malicious slander against the Chinese people. Yang Xiufeng said that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have always educated the people in patriotism and internationalism. We Chinese people strictly distinguish between friends and enemies internationally. We resolutely oppose imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. We do everything we can to strengthen unity and friendship with the people of all countries. We keep in mind Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely prevent great-power chauvinism and narrow nationalism in international exchanges. Now, the sinister plot of the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoging has failed shamefully. Anyone who attempts to use this unfortunate incident to undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world will certainly not succeed.
    Yang Xiufeng finally said that the great Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the people of our country to move from victory to victory in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also becomes an inexhaustible source of strength for the people of all countries in their revolutionary struggles. Although domestic and foreign class enemies collude with each other and try their best to make our country regress and change color, how can a small handful of ants shake the towering tree of socialism? No reactionary force in the world can stop us. The great People's Republic of China will continue to move forward victoriously along the socialist road with the steps of a giant.
    President Yang Xiufeng's speech aroused thunderous applause throughout the venue. People unanimously shouted slogans such as "Long live the Chinese Communist Party" and "Long live Chairman Mao."

    最高人民法院宣判反革命分子杀伤外国朋友案件
    枪决罪大恶极的现行反革命罪犯杨国庆
    杨秀峰院长向参加宣判大会的首都各界一万三千多人宣布：两位受伤的外国朋友经过及时抢救和治疗，都已恢复健康；反革命罪犯杨国庆的罪恶阴谋可耻地失败了；任何人企图利用这次不幸事件来破坏中国人民和世界人民的友谊，也肯定是不能得逞的。
    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国最高人民法院十三日下午举行宣判大会，判处持刀杀伤外国朋友的罪大恶极的现行反革命罪犯杨国庆死刑，并且立即执行。
    这是一个案情特殊重大的反革命凶杀事件。首都各界一万三千多人参加了今天的宣判大会。
    据最高人民法院在大会上宣布，反革命杀人犯杨国庆，是北京市顺义县人，被捕以前住北京市宣武区板章胡同二十号。他的家庭出身是恶霸地主，本人成份是学生，现年十九岁。他父亲在解放前当过伪乡长、还乡团团长，曾杀害革命干部和人民群众六人，一九五三年被人民法院依法判处死刑。解放后，杨国庆的学习和劳动都得到人民政府的合理安排，但他不是同自己的反动家庭划清界限，却坚持反动立场，对党、对政府、对人民怀着刻骨的阶级仇恨。为了实现他反革命报复的目的，他在今年四月二十九日上午十一时五十分左右，闯入北京市东安门大街友谊商店，举刀砍伤出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议的马里新闻工作者代表团团长巴卡里·特拉奥雷先生的颈部，紧接着又砍伤了德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆一等秘书马罗的夫人的脸部。杨国庆行凶后逃出商店门外，就被群众抓获。
    最高人民法院院长杨秀峰在宣判大会上强调指出，现行反革命罪犯杨国庆行凶杀人，绝不是偶然的、孤立的事件，而是当前国内阶级斗争的反映。他谈到，目前我国正面临着一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮。在国内阶级斗争日益深入的情况下，象杨国庆这样死心塌地、穷凶极恶的反革命分子，就会不顾一切地铤而走险，进行公开的、残暴的破坏活动。活生生的、惊心动魄的阶级斗争充分证明，毛主席关于社会主义社会中存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的学说，是完全正确的，是十分英明的。杨秀峰院长要大家牢记毛主席的教导，提高警惕，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。
    宣判大会在北京工人体育馆举行。会场上挂着巨幅标语，上面写着：“彻底肃清一切反革命分子！”“永远不忘阶级斗争！”“中国人民和各国人民的团结和友谊万岁！”参加大会的有北京市企业的职工，郊区公社干部和社员，学生，街道居民，中央机关和北京市机关的干部以及驻京部队的代表。
    在大会主席台上，有最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，最高人民检察院副检察长张苏，以及最高人民法院法庭组成人员：审判长、最高人民法院副院长邢亦民，审判员于铁民、李养吾，书记员籍树理。
    马里驻中国大使馆参赞卡尔苏姆·塞南塔，德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆参赞李伯曼，以及被害人之一的家属、德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆一等秘书马罗，也参加了大会。
    下午三时三十分，最高人民法院副院长王德茂宣布宣判大会开始。法警押反革命杀人犯杨国庆进场。
    法庭审判长邢亦民代表最高人民法院宣布并且执行对杨国庆反革命案的判决。他说，坚持反动立场、怀着刻骨阶级仇恨的反革命罪犯杨国庆，蓄谋杀害外国驻华使馆人员和其他外国朋友，妄图“制造国际血案”，“挑起国际纠纷”，“败坏中国在国际上的声誉”。为了实现这个罪恶目的，他于四月二十九日上午到东城区八面槽日用杂品商店买了一把菜刀，来到东安门大街友谊商店门前。杨犯患有轻微癫癎症，为了防止行凶时病情发作，他服用了鲁米纳尔镇静剂。然后他闯入友谊商店，举刀砍伤了两位外国朋友。
    邢亦民最后宣布说：反革命杀人犯杨国庆，实属罪大恶极，是一个不堪改造的现行反革命罪犯。广大人民群众对此义愤填膺，纷纷要求从严惩办。本院根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例第十六条，比照第七条第二项、第九条第四项的规定，判处反革命杀人犯杨国庆死刑，并立即执行枪决。
    法警随即将反革命杀人犯杨国庆押出会场，赴刑场立即执行枪决。
    最高人民法院的判决，大快人心。参加大会的一万三千多群众振臂高呼：“坚决拥护政府的判决！”“彻底肃清一切反革命分子！”“永远不忘阶级斗争！”“巩固无产阶级专政！”口号声震天动地，持续达数分钟之久。
    随后，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰在大会上讲话（全文另发）。他指出，这个判决对广大的人民群众是一个有力的鼓舞，对形形色色的阶级敌人是一个严重的打击。他强调说，我们国家的人民民主专政制度，空前巩固，威力无穷。任何反革命分子，胆敢进行破坏活动，都肯定逃不脱人民的法网。
    杨秀峰谈到事件的经过时告诉大家说，两位受伤的外国朋友经过及时的抢救和治疗，现在都已经恢复健康。他再一次向两位外国朋友表示歉意和慰问。
    杨秀峰说，我国正面临着一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮。全国广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，积极地投入政治、思想战线上的这场尖锐的阶级斗争，猛烈反击反党反社会主义黑帮的猖狂进攻。
    他说，解放十六年来，我国的社会主义建设取得了光辉的成就，各个战线上的社会主义革命也取得了伟大的胜利，广大人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度不断提高，人民民主专政制度十分巩固。在这样伟大力量的面前，一切牛鬼蛇神都是不堪一击的。但是，反动阶级是不会甘心灭亡的。随着社会主义革命的更加深入，他们越来越无处藏身，必然要进行垂死挣扎。杨秀峰说，在反动阶级最后被消灭以前，长期的、反复的、激烈的阶级斗争，是不可避免的。早在一九四九年，毛主席就向我们指出：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”杨秀峰强调说，我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。
    杨秀峰重申：对于反对和破坏社会主义事业的反动势力和犯罪分子，党和政府历来采取镇压与宽大相结合的政策。但是，在反动阶级中，总有一些人顽固地抗拒改造，一有机会就进行破坏活动。他说，对于现行反革命罪犯，必须坚决打击，要打得狠，打得准，打得及时。
    杨秀峰说，对于地、富、反、坏这四类分子的子女，党和政府从来不把他们和四类分子同等看待。我们合理安排他们的学习和工作，不断加强对他们的教育和改造，争取他们当中的大多数人，同自己的反动家庭划清界限，走社会主义道路。事实上，他们当中有不少人，政治上不断进步，在各种工作岗位上积极地为社会主义服务。但是在四类分子的子女中，也有少数人，受家庭的影响很深，坚持反动阶级的立场，甚至参与种种破坏活动。从杨国庆的家庭，就可以看到这种分化。杨国庆本人执迷不悟，终于走上了绝路。他的弟弟出生在同一个家庭，却是一个共青团员，选择了光明大道。杨秀峰说，我们希望，所有四类分子的子女，都能够以杨国庆的下场为戒，下定决心，彻底改造自己，跟着党和全国人民走社会主义的道路。
    杨秀峰说，现行反革命罪犯杨国庆杀害外国朋友案件的反革命性质本来是十分清楚的。但是，有人却散布流言蜚语，说这次事件表现出中国人民的排外情绪。这是对中国人民的恶意中伤。杨秀峰说，中国共产党和毛主席一贯对人民进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育。我们中国人民在国际上严格分清敌友。我们坚决反对帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派。我们尽一切力量加强同各国人民的团结和友谊。我们牢记毛主席的指示，在国际交往方面，坚决防止大国沙文主义和狭隘民族主义情绪。现在，反革命罪犯杨国庆的罪恶阴谋，可耻地失败了。任何人企图利用这次不幸事件，来破坏中国人民和世界人民的友谊，也肯定是不能得逞的。
    杨秀峰最后说，伟大的毛泽东思想不仅指引着我国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中从胜利走向胜利，而且成为世界各国人民在革命斗争中取之不尽的力量源泉。尽管国内外的阶级敌人互相配合，千方百计地想使我们的国家倒退、变色，但是，一小撮渺小的蚍蜉岂能撼动社会主义的参天大树？世界上任何反动力量也阻挡不了我们。伟大的中华人民共和国，必将继续迈着巨人的步伐，沿着社会主义的道路胜利前进。
    杨秀峰院长的讲话在全场激起了雷鸣般的掌声。人们一致高呼“中国共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”等口号。
