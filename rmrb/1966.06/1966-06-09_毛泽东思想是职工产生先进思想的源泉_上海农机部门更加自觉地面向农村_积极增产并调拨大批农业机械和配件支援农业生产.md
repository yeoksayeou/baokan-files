    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th – The Shanghai Municipal agricultural machinery manufacturing and supply departments have further established the idea of facing the countryside, actively increasing production and allocating large quantities of agricultural machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, and accessories to support the new high tide of agricultural production. As of the end of May, the production tasks for the first half of the year for 7-horsepower hand-held tractors, Fengshou-35 tractors, water pumps, and various agricultural machinery accessories have been completed ahead of schedule or are close to completion. There has been a significant increase in agricultural pesticide machinery. Currently, these machines are being continuously transferred to rural areas.
    This year, the workers in the Shanghai agricultural machinery manufacturing departments have studied Chairman Mao's works and have a higher degree of awareness of serving the 500 million peasants and realizing the mechanization of the people's communes. They fully utilize the human factor in production and take on heavy burdens. Many factories have taken the initiative to propose increasing their tasks without increasing manpower, equipment, or state investment. The Shanghai Tractor Factory, which produces 7-horsepower hand-held tractors, has a national plan for this year that is more than half as large as last year. The workers understand that the peasant brothers and sisters are very welcoming of the hand-held tractors that "one can replace nine cows," and are determined to carry out major technological innovations and tap potential to increase production by another 1,200 units. This factory completed the production tasks for the first half of the year one month ahead of schedule in May. Some factories have also worked hard to trial-produce a batch of new products to meet the needs of agricultural production development. For example, the Fengshou-35 tractor, which is specifically suitable for paddy field cultivation, has been produced in small batches. A 1.5-ton agricultural light transport truck has begun trial runs. This was designed and manufactured by the workers after investigation and research, according to the characteristics of cultivation and transportation in China's rural areas.
    Strengthening the ability of rural people's communes to resist natural disasters and promoting stable and high yields in farmland are the priorities of this year's work for Shanghai's agricultural machinery manufacturing and supply departments. The workers have tried every means to expand the production of urgently needed machinery in this regard, such as water pumps, carts, sprayers, and dusters, which have been produced and allocated ahead of schedule. The Shanghai Water Pump Factory originally planned to supply large water pumps to Shandong, Hebei, and other places within the year. After proper arrangements and adjustments to production by the workers, they were finally able to supply these areas in a timely manner in May. The staff of the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Supply Station of the Eighth Ministry of Machinery Industry went deep into the factories to study and implement the production of goods together with the factories, ensuring the early allocation of maintenance accessories for tractors and internal combustion engines.
    Under the circumstances of increased production tasks, the workers insisted on quality first, striving for more, faster, and more economical production on the premise of quality, and worked hard to improve quality. For example, the quality of important accessories for tractors and automobiles, such as steel plate springs, and parts such as piston pins for engines on 7-horsepower hand-held tractors, has been significantly improved.
    In order to help rural people's communes cultivate a technical team for agricultural mechanization, the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Company has organized several working groups to go to rural areas in Shandong, Henan, and suburban Beijing to repair tractors with local users and exchange usage and maintenance techniques. The Agricultural Machinery Supply Station of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company organized twice as many employees as last year to go to the countryside to set up stalls to supply agricultural machinery accessories and carry accessories to various tractor stations for mobile services.

    毛泽东思想是职工产生先进思想的源泉
    上海农机部门更加自觉地面向农村
    积极增产并调拨大批农业机械和配件支援农业生产
    新华社上海七日电　上海市农业机械制造和供应部门进一步树立面向农村的思想，积极增产与调拨大批农业机械、排灌机械和配件，支援农业生产新高潮。到五月底为止，七马力手扶拖拉机、丰收—35型拖拉机、水泵以及各种农用机械配件，都已提前或接近完成了上半年度的生产任务，农用药械有较大幅度的增长。目前，这些机械正源源调往各地农村。
    今年，上海农业机械制造部门的职工，通过大学毛主席著作，为五亿农民服务、为人民公社实现机械化服务的自觉性更高了。他们在生产中充分发挥人的因素，抢挑重担。许多工厂主动提出在不增人、不增设备、不要国家投资的条件下，往自己肩上增加任务。生产七马力手扶拖拉机的上海拖拉机厂，今年国家计划比去年增加半倍以上，职工们了解到农民兄弟非常欢迎“一台能顶九头牛”的手扶拖拉机，决心大闹技术革新、挖掘潜力，再增产一千二百台。这个厂已在五月份提前一个月完成了上半年度的生产任务。一些工厂还努力试制出一批新产品，适应农业生产发展的需要。如专门适用水田耕作的丰收—35型拖拉机，已小批进行生产。载重一吨半的农用轻便运输卡车，已开始试车，这是职工们经过调查研究，根据我国农村的耕作、运输特点设计、制造的。
    加强农村人民公社抵抗自然灾害的能力，促进农田稳产高产，是今年上海农业机械制造、供应部门工作的重点。职工们千方百计扩大生产这方面急需的机械，象水泵、力车、喷雾喷粉器等产品，都提前生产，提前调拨。上海水泵厂原定年内供应山东、河北等地的大型水泵，经过职工们妥善安排，调整了生产，终于在五月份及时供应这些地区。第八机械工业部上海农业机械供应站职工深入工厂，与工厂一起研究落实货源的生产，保证了拖拉机、内燃机维修配件的提前调拨。
    职工们在生产任务增加的情况下，坚持好字当头，好中求多、求快、求省，在提高质量上狠下功夫。如拖拉机、汽车上的重要配件钢板弹簧，七马力手扶拖拉机上发动机的活塞肖等零件，质量都显著提高。
    为了帮助农村人民公社培养一支农业机械化的技术队伍，上海市农业机械制造公司组织了好几个工作组，到山东、河南和北京郊区等地农村，同当地用户一起维修拖拉机，交流使用和保养技术。上海市机电设备公司农机供应站组织了比去年多两倍的职工下乡，设摊供应农机配件，携带配件到各拖拉机站巡回服务。
