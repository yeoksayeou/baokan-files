The leader of the Vietnamese Writers Delegation, Chuan Chang, delivered a report at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers today, exposing the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in Vietnam and its deceitful peace ploys. He also reported on the Vietnamese people's determination and heroic deeds in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and introduced the achievements of Vietnamese writers in the struggle.

Chuan Chang first expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people, led by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, for their wholehearted support for the Vietnamese people's struggle. He also thanked the people of socialist brother countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all working people around the world, including the American people, for their great and precious support and assistance to the Vietnamese people.

Chuan Chang briefly recounted the history of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam over the past twenty years and severely condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in Vietnam. He said, "American imperialists have planted deep hatred in the hearts of every Vietnamese. They have stained American history with a great stain that even the waters of the five oceans cannot wash away." He said, "The barbaric behavior of American imperialists on our soil is far more horrifying than the crimes committed by the Hitler fascists during World War II. American imperialists have crossed the line between humans and beasts, becoming bloodthirsty beasts."

Chuan Chang exposed the Johnson administration's deceitful peace ploys. He said: While the American bandits are dropping bombs on our people, they are also dropping millions of leaflets calling for "peace"; while they are killing our children, they are also dropping clothes, dolls, and toys to show their "love" for the suffering children. The despicable tactics of American imperialists can only further incite the great hatred of the originally kind-hearted Vietnamese mothers.

Chuan Chang said, "The so-called 'peace' and 'unconditional negotiations' repeatedly proclaimed by U.S. President Johnson and American diplomats exactly reveal the black hearts behind the seemingly benevolent language of the White House. The Vietnamese people will never be deceived by such 'hypocritical' lies of the American aggressors."

Chuan Chang said that the bombing and strafing of North Vietnam by American imperialists cannot shake the resolve of our people. The Vietnamese nation has never surrendered to any imperialist aggression.

"Neither swords can cut off the Bach Dang River, nor fires can burn down the Long Son Mountains. Hatred upon hatred, blood debts must be repaid with blood."

Chuan Chang said that without completely eliminating the American aggressors, there can be no freedom. As long as there is still one American aggressor on our soil, the happiness of every individual and every family, and the survival of the entire nation, will be threatened. He emphasized, "American imperialists foolishly think that our people, who love labor, will be afraid of war; they think that our people, who have been engaged in peaceful construction for more than ten years, will not dare to dig trenches. They try to intimidate us with death and destruction. Based on the vile logic of the Wall Street bosses, they attempt to use our people's love for life to blackmail us into war. But our people have already responded to them with gunfire."

In his report, Chuan Chang discussed the achievements of the Vietnamese people in socialist construction under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Workers' Party. He said that it is precisely because we love socialism in the North so much, for the sake of our fellow countrymen in the South and the cause of national reunification, that our people spare no effort or resources; our people understand self-sacrifice for the country. With unprecedented heroism, our people have thrown themselves into fierce battles. Chuan Chang said, "The burning hatred for American aggressors, the thousand-year tradition of national steadfastness, and the vitality of socialism are converging into an invincible force, forming a momentum that sweeps across the entire North Vietnam to resist American aggression and save the nation."

He then spoke about the countless heroic deeds of the military and civilians in North Vietnam in resisting American airstrikes. He said that the military and civilians in the North have used various anti-aircraft weapons to create a powerful network of firepower at different altitudes, striking American aircraft mercilessly. The young air force of North Vietnam has also dealt a fatal blow to the U.S. Air Force. He said that every time American pilots change their tactics, tens of thousands of military and civilians come up with ways to counter them. He pointed out, "Can the tricks of the bandits compare with the wisdom of tens of millions of united revolutionary people? Can the modern technology of American imperialists stand up to the power of a highly developed people's war?"

In discussing the contributions of writers and artists in North Vietnam to the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, Chuan Chang said, "The revolutionary war is providing extremely rich content for the literature of the entire Vietnamese nation." He expressed that the writers in North Vietnam would ensure "as many works as possible that reflect the immortal epic of our motherland, contributing to the revolutionary literature of Asia and the world." He said, "National culture, national literature, and national independence and sovereignty are inseparable. We want to build a rich and colorful national culture, so we are determined to be soldiers on the cultural front against American aggression, together with the people of the entire nation."

Chuan Chang then said in his report: "The struggle of the Vietnamese people is, together with the revolutionary forces of the world, fiercely impacting imperialism, first and foremost American imperialism. The great victories that our people have already achieved and the decisive victories that we will surely achieve are the victories of Marxism-Leninism, the victories of the revolutionary line of self-reliance led by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

He said, "These victories are inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the great Chinese people, the great Soviet people, and the people of other socialist brother countries; they are inseparable from the strengthening and consolidation of the struggle movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the working class and laboring people of capitalist countries, and the people of the world who love justice, freedom, and peace, including the American people and progressive intellectuals. Our people are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and friends from all over the world."

He strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in interfering with and invading Laos and Cambodia, and enthusiastically praised the anti-American patriotic struggles of the Lao and Cambodian peoples. He said that in the common struggle against American imperialism, the fates of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are more closely linked than ever before. He expressed his warm respect to the writers representing the brave Lao and Cambodian peoples and was willing to join them in using his pen to firmly fight for the maintenance of the national independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of the three countries, and for the fraternal friendship among the peoples of the three countries.

He pointed out, "American imperialism is clinging to South Vietnam because South Vietnam is a strategic stronghold in Southeast Asia. At the same time, they are afraid that if South Vietnam becomes independent and free, and Vietnam is reunified, it will greatly inspire the national liberation movements of the countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Fully aware of our sacred duty to our motherland, and aware of our responsibility to the national liberation movement and to the movement for defending national independence, democracy, and world peace, our people are determined to fight, to cut off the poisonous claws of this most ferocious beast of the 20th century, American imperialism. Our people have only one stance, that is, the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

He emphasized, "American imperialism must withdraw all its troops and weapons from South Vietnam, dismantle its military bases in South Vietnam, and permanently and unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam, allowing the people of South Vietnam to solve their own affairs on the basis of the program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and allowing the Vietnamese people to solve the problem of national reunification themselves, without allowing any foreign interference."

He said, "More than a year of practice has proven that American bombs cannot make our people afraid of the Americans, difficulties cannot make our people retreat, but can only further temper our people's courage, further unite us to decisively defeat American imperialism, and decisively carry out economic and cultural construction. Our people are getting stronger and more determined with each battle, proving that we have the ability and wisdom to defeat the American bandits in any situation. American imperialism is a dangerous beast, but it is not at all frightening."

Chuan Chang said, "We are writers living in the stormy and turbulent region of Asia and Africa, and we all stand on the common front of opposing imperialism, first and foremost American imperialism, and striving for national independence and true peace in the Asia and Africa region. Therefore, we have a common aspiration. We believe that this conference is a symbol of such fighting unity."

He said, "Our literature is a weapon for revolutionary struggle. Imperialist literature is a weapon of counter-revolution, a literature of enslaving oppressed nations and peoples. Therefore, if we do not resolutely oppose the reactionary 'culture' and decadent ideology of American imperialism, we cannot shatter the smoke screen of American imperialist deception and deceit."

He said that this conference has made supporting Vietnam in its struggle against American imperialist aggression the top priority. Many Asian and African writers, both present and absent, have described the struggles of our people in the North and South with the enthusiasm of supporting our people's struggle. He expressed his gratitude once again to the conference and to all Asian and African writers who have actively opposed imperialism and mobilized public opinion in their countries to support the Vietnamese people.

### 越南作家代表团长春长的报告

    越南作家代表团长春长的报告
    新华社二十八日讯　越南民主共和国作家代表团团长春长，今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上作报告，揭露美帝国主义在越南犯下的种种滔天罪行及其玩弄的假和平阴谋，并报告了越南人民进行抗美救国斗争的决心和英雄事迹，介绍了越南作家在斗争中所取得的成就。
    春长在报告中首先对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下的兄弟的中国人民全心全意支援越南人民的斗争表示感谢，对社会主义兄弟国家人民、亚非拉各国人民以及包括美国人民在内的全世界劳动人民所给予越南人民的巨大和宝贵的支持和援助，表示谢意。
    春长扼要地追述了二十年来美帝国主义对越南侵略的历史，并严厉谴责了美帝国主义在越南所犯下的滔天罪行。他说，“美帝国主义者在每一个越南人心中种下了深仇大恨。他们给美国历史涂上大污点，连五大洋的水都永远洗刷不净。”他说，“美帝国主义者在我们国土上的野蛮行为，远比第二次世界大战中希特勒法西斯暴徒的罪行更加骇人听闻。美帝国主义者已越过了人与野兽之间的界线，变成了嗜血的野兽。”
    春长揭露约翰逊政府玩弄的假和平阴谋。他说：美国强盗在把炸弹扔向我国人民头上的同时，又抛出了成亿张呼吁“和平”的传单；在残杀我们的孩子的同时，又抛出衣服、洋娃娃、玩具来表示他们“疼爱苦难的孩子”。美帝国主义者这种卑劣的手段，只能更加激起那些本是善良淳厚的越南母亲的莫大仇恨。
    春长说，“美国总统约翰逊以及美国外交政客们再三宣称的‘和平’、‘无条件协商’等论调，恰好道破了白宫那些所谓从‘善意’出发的语言的黑心肠。我们越南人民永远不会被美国侵略者这种‘佛口蛇心’的谰言所蒙骗”。
    春长说，美帝国主义者轰炸扫射越南北方，丝毫不能使我国人民动摇。越南民族没有在任何帝国主义的强暴面前屈服过。
    “什么剑也斩不断边海河，什么火也烧不尽长山山脉。仇恨加仇恨，血债要用血来还。”
    春长说，不彻底消灭美国侵略者，就不可能有自由。只要我们国土上还有一个美国侵略者，每个人和每个家庭的幸福，整个民族的生存，就将受到威胁。他强调说：“美帝国主义者愚蠢地以为，我国人民既然爱劳动，就会害怕战争；以为我国人民已进行了十多年和平建设，现在就不敢挖战壕。他们拿死亡和破坏来吓唬我们。他们根据华尔街老板们的卑鄙逻辑，妄想利用我国人民对生活的热爱来进行战争讹诈。但是，我国人民已经用炮火来回答了他们。”
    春长在报告中谈到越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下进行社会主义建设的成就。他说，正是由于我们无限热爱社会主义的北方，为了南方骨肉的同胞和统一祖国的事业，我国人民丝毫不吝惜人力和物力；我国人民很懂得为祖国而忘我牺牲。我国人民以前所未有的英雄气概，投入了激烈的战斗。春长说，“仇恨美国侵略者的熊熊烈火，民族的坚贞不屈的千年传统和社会主义的生命力，正在汇集成无敌的力量，形成遍及整个越南北方的抗美救国的气吞山河之势。”
    他接着谈到越南北方的军民抗击美国飞机轰炸的无数英雄事迹。他说，北方军民用各种防空武器，在不同高度的空间布满了强有力的火力网，狠狠地打击了美国飞机。越南北方年轻的空军也给了美国空军以致命的打击。他说，每当美国飞行员变换新的战术，就有成千上万的军民想出办法对付他们。他指出，“强盗的阴谋诡计怎能比得过已经团结起来的千百万革命人民的智慧呢？美帝国主义者的现代化技术怎能对付得了已经高度发展的人民战争的威力呢？”春长在谈到越南北方的作家和艺术家们在抗美救国斗争中所作出的贡献时说，“革命战争正为我们越南全国的文学提供极其丰富的内容。”他表示，越南北方的作家们要保证“尽可能多地写出能体现我们祖国不朽的英雄史诗的作品，为亚洲和世界革命文学作出贡献。”他说，“民族文化、民族文学与国家的独立和主权是分不开的。我们要建立丰富多彩的民族文化，因此，我们决心同全国人民一道，全力以赴地做抗美文化战线上的战士。”
    春长随后在报告中谈到：“越南人民的斗争正在同世界革命力量一道猛烈地冲击着帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义。我们的人民已经取得的巨大的胜利和必将取得的决定性的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府的以自力更生为主的英明的革命路线的胜利。”
    他又说：“这些胜利是同伟大的中国人民、伟大的苏联人民和其它社会主义兄弟国家人民的热情支援分不开的，是同亚非拉各国人民，同资本主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民，同包括美国人民和进步知识分子在内的世界爱好公理、自由、和平的人们的斗争运动的壮大和巩固分不开的。我国人民非常感谢亚非拉的朋友和全世界的朋友的热情支持。”
    他强烈谴责了美帝国主义干涉和侵略老挝和柬埔寨的罪行，并且热烈赞扬了老挝人民和柬埔寨人民的反美爱国斗争。他说，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，越南、老挝、柬埔寨三国的命运比任何时候都更加紧密地联系在一起。他向代表着英勇的老挝人民和柬埔寨人民的作家表示热情的敬意，并且愿同他们一道用自己的笔杆为维护三国的民族独立、领土完整和主权，为三国人民间的兄弟友谊而坚决斗争。
    他指出，“美帝国主义死赖在越南南方是因为越南南方是东南亚的战略重地。同时他们害怕越南南方一旦独立、自由，越南一旦统一，将会大大地鼓舞亚非拉各国的民族解放运动。由于充分地认识到对自己祖国的神圣责任，意识到自己对民族解放运动、对保卫民族独立、民主和世界和平运动的责任，我国人民决心战斗，斩断美帝国主义者这只二十世纪的最凶恶的野兽的毒爪。我国人民只有一个立场，那就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。”
    他强调说：“美帝国主义必须把全部军队和武器撤出越南南方，撤除在越南南方的军事基地，永远地无条件地停止轰炸越南北方，让越南南方人民自己在越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领的基础上解决自己的事务，让越南人民自己解决自己国家的统一问题，不允许任何外国干涉。”
    他说，“一年多来的实践证明，美国炸弹不能使我国人民害怕美国佬，困难不能使我国人民后退，相反，只能更进一步锻炼我国人民的勇敢精神，更进一步促使我们万众一心坚决打败美帝国主义，坚决进行经济和文化建设。我国人民越打越强，越打越坚定，越打越证明自己有足够的能力和智慧在任何情况下都能打垮美国强盗。美帝国主义是一只危险的野兽，但它没有丝毫值得可怕的。”
    春长说，“我们是生活在斗争和革命风暴风起云涌的亚非地区的作家，我们都站在反对帝国主义、首先是美帝国主义，争取亚非地区的民族独立和真正和平的共同战线上，因此，我们之间有着共同的愿望。我们相信，这个会议就是这种战斗团结的一个象征。”
    他说：“我们的文学是进行革命斗争的武器。帝国主义的文学是反革命的武器，是奴役各被压迫民族和人民的文学。因此，如果不坚决反对美帝国主义的反动‘文化’和颓废的思想，我们就不能粉碎美帝国主义的欺骗和愚弄的烟幕。”
    他说，这次会议把支持越南反对美帝国主义侵略列为首要的问题。在场的和不在场的许多亚非作家曾以支持我国人民斗争的热情描写了我们南北两方人民的斗争。他表示再一次向会议、向已经和正在积极反对帝国主义，动员本国舆论支持越南人民的所有亚非作家表示感谢。
