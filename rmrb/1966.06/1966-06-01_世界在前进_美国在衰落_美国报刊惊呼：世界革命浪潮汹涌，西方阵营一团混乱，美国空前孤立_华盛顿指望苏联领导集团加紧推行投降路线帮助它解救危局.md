    The World is Advancing, the United States is Declining
    American Newspapers Lament: The World Revolutionary Tide is Surging, the Western Camp is in Chaos, and the United States is Unprecedentedly Isolated
    Washington Hopes that the Soviet Leadership Group will Step Up its Pursuit of a Capitulationist Line to Help it Out of the Crisis
    Some American newspapers, in commenting on the current world situation and the United States' predicament, lament that the United States' position is declining.
    The May 16th issue of *U.S. News & World Report*, in discussing the turbulent and divisive world situation, wrote, "At the end of World War II... its (the United States') leadership was unquestioned, except in the Communist world." "But in this decade, the face of the world has changed considerably." "In such a politically diverse world... the voice of the United States has become less powerful."
    The magazine admitted that in vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the people's revolutionary movements are surging. The magazine said, "The struggle against colonial rule has led to the stirring of nationalist sentiment. As in the past, the turbulent continent of Asia will certainly be a troubled place in the next generation." "In Latin America... there are also many potentially explosive situations." The magazine also said that in these regions, the United States' "role as protector, benefactor, and peacekeeper is often frustrating," and "nationalism... has become a fundamental factor in most of the serious problems the United States currently faces abroad."
    Speaking of the disunity within the Western camp, the American magazine said, "Cracks have appeared in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and due to the "recovery" of the economies of Western European countries, these countries are "increasingly assertive."
    "France is setting up roadblocks on the path of the Atlantic alliance." "President Charles de Gaulle's resurgence of national interests is endangering the plans for European unity and the Atlantic community pursued by successive American governments since the end of World War II."
    The magazine also said that although the United States claims to have dozens of "allies," it is actually isolated. "Few allies are rushing to help the United States in Vietnam or anywhere else... The predicament of the United States acting alone is beginning to cause concern and raise questions." The magazine also said uneasily, "The United States' alliance in Southeast Asia is disintegrating. The alliance supported by the United States in the Middle East has never taken action." "The record of the military efforts made by the United States in Lebanon, the Congo, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Vietnam in recent years has led (American) officials to believe that when the United States needs help, its allies always hesitate, and these alliances themselves are in a state of chaos."
    In the face of encirclement, the United States is counting on the Soviet revisionist clique to help it out of the crisis. The magazine expressed great appreciation for the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the interests of the people of all countries and its pursuit of a capitulationist line. The magazine wrote, "The Soviet Union, which was once the bastion of international (Communist) ideology after 1917, has now lost its emphasis on world revolution." "In this atmosphere, the Soviet Union's foreign policy has been greatly weakened, and the government's attitude has become truly conservative. The Soviet Union's public declaration of 'peaceful coexistence' and the pursuit of communist goals through constitutional means, rather than the violent path of 'national liberation wars' advocated by the dissenting Chinese, reflects this change. Therefore, the Soviet Union has become a moderate factor in the world today."
    However, the help of the Soviet revisionist clique cannot extricate the United States from its predicament. The American magazine pointed out that the anti-American storms currently raging around the world have left the United States government struggling to cope. It wrote that the war of aggression against Vietnam alone "has put a strain on the United States' military system." "With the exception of the Strategic Air Command, almost every aspect of the Air Force and Navy is thinly stretched and understaffed. If an emergency occurs outside of Vietnam, the United States' airlift and sealift capabilities will be difficult to respond to quickly after receiving notice. To meet the needs in Vietnam, the tactical air forces of the Navy and Air Force are now working overtime. Some people are also worried about the readiness of the Atlantic Fleet and the Seventh Army stationed in Europe, should real trouble break out there (Europe)."
    American columnist Walter Lippmann pointed out in the May 23rd issue of *Newsweek* that the United States' withdrawal of other armed forces from Europe and around the world to supplement the Vietnam battlefield is a "stopgap" measure. He came to the painful conclusion that the American president has committed the United States to a war in Asia in order to achieve an impossible goal—establishing a pro-American government on a continent seething with revolutionary fervor.
    An editorial in the May 17th issue of *The Wall Street Journal* pointed out that the United States' problem is that it wants to manage too much, not only in Vietnam but also wherever so-called "Communist aggression" appears in the world, resulting in being overstretched and exhausted. The editorial said, "We admit that this is a clear and stark predicament."
    These comments from American newspapers show that under the impact of the world revolutionary tide, American imperialism is still carrying out aggression and intervention everywhere, attempting to counterattack. However, it cannot reverse the excellent situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind; on the contrary, it is accelerating its own process of destruction.

    世界在前进　美国在衰落
    美国报刊惊呼：世界革命浪潮汹涌，西方阵营一团混乱，美国空前孤立
    华盛顿指望苏联领导集团加紧推行投降路线帮助它解救危局
    美国一些报刊在评论当前的世界局势和美国的处境时哀叹美国的地位正在江河日下。
    五月十六日的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志谈到世界局势动荡分化的情况时写道，“在第二次世界大战结束时……除了共产党世界以外，它（美国）的领导地位是不容置疑的。”“但是在这十年里，世界面貌有了不少的变化”。“在这样一个政治上五花八门的世界上……美国的声音变得不是那么有力量了。”
    杂志承认，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大地区，人民革命运动汹涌澎湃。杂志说，“反对殖民统治的斗争带来了对民族主义情绪的鼓动。象在过去一样，沸腾的亚洲大陆在下一代中肯定也会是一个多事的地方。”“在拉丁美洲……也有着许多潜在的爆炸性局势。”杂志还说，在这些地区，美国“扮演保护者、恩主和和平维护者的角色常常是令人沮丧的”，“民族主义……已成为美国当前在国外面临的大多数严重问题中的基本因素”。
    谈到西方阵营内部四分五裂的局面时，这家美国杂志说，“北大西洋公约组织出现了裂缝”，由于西欧国家经济的“恢复”，这些国家“越来越坚持己见了”。
  “法国正在大西洋联盟的道路上设置路障”。“法国总统戴高乐的政策中的民族利益再度抬头，而使实现第二次世界大战结束以来历届美国政府所追求的欧洲联盟和大西洋共同体的计划陷于危险中。”
    杂志还说，尽管美国号称拥有数十个“盟国”，然而处境实际上是孤立的。“在越南或者其他任何地方，很少盟国赶来帮助美国……美国单干的窘境正开始引起忧虑、引起问题”。杂志还不安地说，“美国在东南亚的联盟正在瓦解。美国在中东支持的联盟则从来没有行动起来。”“美国近些年来在黎巴嫩、刚果、古巴、多米尼加共和国以及越南所作的军事努力的纪录已经使（美国）官员们认为：当美国需要帮助时，美国的盟国总是裹足不前的，而且这些联盟本身也是一团混乱的。”
    在四面楚歌的情况下，美国正在指望苏联修正主义集团帮助它解救危局。杂志对苏联修正主义集团出卖各国人民利益、推行投降主义路线表示十分赞赏。杂志写道，“在一九一七年以后曾经是国际（共产）主义的堡垒的苏联，对世界革命的强调现在已经消失了。”“在这种气氛下，苏联的对外政策已经锐气大减，政府的态度已经变得的的确确地保守了。苏联公开声明要‘和平共处’，要通过立宪途径来实现共产主义的目标，而不要持有不同意见的中国人所鼓吹的‘民族解放战争’的暴力途径，这就反映了这种变化。因此，苏联已经成为今天世界上的一个温和因素。”
    但是，苏联修正主义集团的帮忙，解脱不了美国的困境。这家美国杂志指出，当前世界各地的反美风暴已经使美国政府穷于应付。它写道，单单是侵越战争，就“使得美国的军事体系感到吃紧”。“除了战略空军以外，空军和海军差不多每一个方面都是兵力分散和不足的。如果越南以外的地区发生紧急状态，美国的空运和海运能力将难以在接到通知后很快就能应付局势。为了应付在越南的需要，海空军的战术空军力量现在正在加班加点工作。一些人还对大西洋舰队和驻在欧洲的第七军的准备状态表示担心，如果在那里（欧洲）爆发真正的麻烦的话。”
    美国专栏作家李普曼在五月二十三日出版的《新闻周刊》上指出美国抽调欧洲和世界各地的其他武装部队补充到越南战场上去，是一种“挖肉补疮”的办法。他得出的痛苦的结论是，美国总统已经使美国投入一场亚洲的战争，为的是实现一个不能实现的目的——在沸腾着革命浪潮的大陆上，建立一个亲美的政府。
    五月十七日的《华尔街日报》的社论指出，美国的问题是想管的太广，不仅在越南干，而且世界上无论哪里只要出现所谓“共产党侵略”都得去干，结果是力不从心，心劳日拙。社论说，“我们承认，这是一个明显而冷酷的窘境”。
    美国报刊的这些评论说明，在世界革命浪潮的冲击下，美帝国主义还在到处侵略干涉，企图反扑。但是它扭转不了东风压倒西风的大好形势，相反地，正在加速自己覆灭的过程。
