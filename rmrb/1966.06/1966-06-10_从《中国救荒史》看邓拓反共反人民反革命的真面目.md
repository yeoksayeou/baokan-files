Edition: 3

    Deng Tuo's anti-Communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary stance was by no means accidental. His counter-revolutionary activities have a long history. As early as 1937, his book "A History of Famine Relief in China" completely exposed his counter-revolutionary ugly face. Although he wore the label of a Communist Party member at that time, he was engaged in anti-Communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. He tried his best to distort history, create counter-revolutionary fallacies, cover up the basic contradictions of Chinese society, beautify the feudal emperors of the past dynasties, beautify imperialism, and beautify the counter-revolutionary head Chiang Kai-shek. He viciously cursed the peasant uprisings of the past, slandered the Communist Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army it led, offered advice to Chiang Kai-shek, and attempted to strangle the revolution and consolidate Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule. This book was published by the Commercial Press in 1937 (under the name "Deng Yunte"), with a fine cloth binding, and included in the "Chinese Cultural History Series" edited by the counter-revolutionary head Wang Yunwu, as the second series of this series, which shows the extent to which it was appreciated by the reactionary regime. What is even more hateful is that Deng Tuo, this old traitor, actually reprinted and released poison twice in 1958 and 1961. This fully illustrates the consistency of Deng Tuo's anti-Communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Now let's take a look at how Deng Tuo carried out anti-Communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities through this book.
    I. Covering up the Basic Contradictions of Chinese Society and Creating Counter-Revolutionary Fallacies
    In the "Introduction" to this book, Deng Tuo declared: His "history of famine relief is not only a narrative of general facts, but also a history of social diseases and a history of social etiology," "in order to explore the therapeutic principles and approaches of sociology." Please see, how did Deng Tuo "diagnose" the "diseases" and "sources of disease" of old China?
    Deng Tuo described the basic problems of Chinese society as "disasters such as floods, droughts, locusts, wind, earthquakes, epidemics, frost, and snow." He used sixty pages to render the "universality" of China's disasters (that is, "no year without disaster" and "no place without disaster"), "continuity," and "accumulation," saying that "the number of disasters in our country is unmatched in the world." He even completely learned the tone of imperialism, slandering China as a "land of famine." He attributed all problems to disasters. He said: "The most serious development and the most important result of disasters is social upheaval." Disasters are the "most direct, most basic, and most important reason" for the "reduction of rural labor" and the "sharp reduction of arable land throughout the country." Disasters are "one of the main reasons for the highest mortality rate" in China's population. "The most direct result of disasters is the collapse of the entire rural economy, which fundamentally subverts the foundation of the national economy." He also said: "The repeated peasant uprisings, regardless of their scope or duration, were all triggered by disasters, and all were against the background of famine years. This has almost become a historical norm," "almost an insurmountable law." He even attributed "the invasion of foreign nationalities" and "wars between nationalities" to disasters, saying that "the invasion of foreign nationalities is often the direct result of disasters." In short, Deng Tuo described disasters as the crux of all problems in Chinese society. So how were the disasters in modern Chinese history before the War of Resistance Against Japan caused? He didn't mention the disasters caused to the people by imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule (only a few words about feudal exploitation), but he babbled that the peasants were "stupid," "lazy," and had no "storage," "resulting in backward agricultural technology that could not defeat natural disasters." He also talked a lot about how China's geographical environment and climate change and other natural conditions caused disasters, and those natural conditions were insurmountable. To sum up, Deng Tuo's theory is that all social problems are caused by disasters, and disasters are mainly caused by natural disasters.
    This is a big lie. In Deng Tuo's writing, class exploitation disappeared, national oppression disappeared, and a history of class struggle became a history of "God-given disasters" and a "history of famine relief" by emperors, generals, and even reactionary heads like Chiang Kai-shek. This is completely anti-historical and anti-scientific, and it is a thorough counter-revolutionary fallacy.
    Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that the contradiction between feudal landlords and peasants was the main contradiction of feudal society, and the peasant revolutions of the past were precisely generated by this contradiction. Chairman Mao said: "The feudal landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to launch many uprisings to resist the rule of the landlord class." How can it be said that peasant uprisings were caused by disasters? Since the imperialist invasion of China, China has become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The root cause of China's economic and cultural backwardness and the poverty, bankruptcy, and death of the people is the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism. The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the masses of the people are the basic contradictions and main contradictions of modern Chinese society. Chairman Mao said: "The great modern and contemporary Chinese revolution has occurred and developed on the basis of these basic contradictions." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") How can it be said that all this was caused by disasters?
    Natural conditions are indeed the cause of disasters, but the main cause is the plunder and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. As early as 1930, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Because the state's taxes have increased, the landlords' rent has increased, and the war has become more and more widespread, resulting in widespread disasters and banditry throughout the country, which has made it impossible for the vast number of peasants and urban poor to survive." ("A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire") Why did Deng Tuo mainly attribute the causes of disasters to natural conditions, without mentioning the plunder of imperialism, and without exposing the disasters caused to the people by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule?
    Deng Tuo slandered China as a "land of famine," saying that geographical conditions and a large population determined that the Chinese people would forever suffer from "famine" in the past, present, and future. This is simply the same tone as what former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson said in 1949! Acheson said: "The problem of the Chinese people's meals" "has not been solved by any government until now." It is particularly worth noting that Acheson's fallacy has long been refuted by Chairman Mao, and the "truth that revolution plus production can solve the problem of eating" pointed out by Chairman Mao has long been confirmed by the victorious New China. And Deng Tuo threw out this reactionary theory again in 1958 and 1961. Isn't his sinister intention very obvious?
    Deng Tuo's "disaster theory" and Hu Shi's fallacy of "five ghosts (poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, disturbance) making trouble in China" are completely the same. Its purpose is to cover up the class contradictions in Chinese society, cover up the real reasons for the poverty and bankruptcy of the people, cover up the monstrous crimes of imperialism, feudalism, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and attempt to deceive the people, shift the goals of the people's revolution, and extinguish the flames of the people's revolution. This is completely adapted to the needs of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. At that time, Japanese imperialism wanted to turn China into its colony, and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship was opposed by the people of the whole country. A revolutionary upsurge under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party had already appeared, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule was in a state of constant contradictions. In this case, Deng Tuo broke out of the door and openly exonerated Chiang Kai-shek, which was in line with Chiang Kai-shek's needs. This fully exposed the face of Deng Tuo, this revolutionary traitor.
    II. Doing Everything Possible to Cover up Imperialist Aggression
    Deng Tuo's book was published on June 2, 1937, only one month and five days away from the "July 7th" Incident. At this time, Japanese imperialism had already occupied the four northeastern provinces of our country, had already established a Yin Rugeng puppet government in North China, and was secretly transporting troops, preparing to launch a large-scale attack on China and destroy China. At this time, the Sino-Japanese contradiction had become the main contradiction in our country. The people of the whole country had already set off an anti-Japanese upsurge under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, while the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government was stubbornly adhering to the traitorous dictatorship. At this critical juncture of national life and death, Deng Tuo, who was hanging the sign of a Communist Party member, wrote "A History of Famine Relief in China" with more than 500 pages under the title of studying China's "social diseases" and "social etiology." He did not mention the disasters caused to the Chinese people by imperialist aggression, especially Japanese imperialist aggression, as if there was no imperialist aggression against China in the world, and there was no Japanese imperialism that wanted to destroy China. Isn't it clear that Deng Tuo wanted to cover up for imperialism?
    Deng Tuo not only concealed imperialist aggression, but also defended imperialist aggression, saying that "the aggression of foreign forces in modern times... is the direct result of disasters," "the prolongation of disasters wears down the internal strength of the nation, and when the internal strength is insufficient, external forces can invade, which is a common reason." What a "common reason." Is it that imperialist aggression against China is not determined by the nature of imperialism, but by China's disasters? Isn't the destruction of China's "internal strength" caused by imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule? Should imperialism invade China because China suffered from disasters? Didn't Japanese imperialism occupy the three northeastern provinces of our country without firing a single shot because Chiang Kai-shek was a traitor, but because of China's disasters? Isn't this a complete traitor theory?
    Deng Tuo felt that it was not enough to serve Japanese imperialism in this way, and he further beautified U.S. imperialism. In 1931 and 1933, U.S. imperialism gave Chiang Kai-shek two "cotton and wheat loans" in order to support Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression" of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Deng Tuo actually promoted the crime of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek jointly slaughtering the people as "U.S. aid wheat" for "relieving the Yangtze River floods," "revitalizing the rural areas of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces," "repairing people's dikes," and "repairing the Grand Canal." As everyone knows, the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi mentioned by Deng Tuo here are the Jiangxi revolutionary base area centered on Jinggang Mountain and the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base area centered on Dabie Mountain. At that time, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army liberated places in these two provinces, beat local tyrants, distributed land, and "distributed land and land was really busy," making the bankrupt rural areas embark on a prosperous road. The "huge role" played by U.S. imperialism here was nothing but transfusing blood to Chiang Kai-shek to help Chiang Kai-shek suppress the revolution in these places. What Deng Tuo praised here was the counter-revolutionary role of U.S. imperialism. At that time, in order to plunder China, U.S. imperialism sent some imperialist elements to jointly set up a "China Foreign Relief Society" with Chiang Kai-shek, which is the same trick that U.S. imperialism uses today to send "peace corps" everywhere. Deng Tuo actually described the counter-revolutionary "China Foreign Relief Society" as a "charitable organization" and praised it greatly. He said that it held "agricultural relief" and "industrial relief" with "excellent results," and that it provided "loans of U.S. wheat" and implemented "relief funds" in the disasters in Anhui, Jiangxi, and the Yellow River basin, saying that "disaster farmers have benefited greatly from recovering agriculture and building houses." Desperately describing the crimes of imperialist aggression as good deeds, wasn't Deng Tuo's traitorous face nakedly exposed?
    III. Trying Hard to Praise the Merits of Feudal Emperors of the Past and Chiang Kai-shek, Offering Advice and Suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek
    Deng Tuo searched for relevant "remarks" and "examples" of "famine relief" from the edicts of emperors of the past dynasties, the memorials of hundreds of officials, and the writings of feudal literati, as well as official documents of the Kuomintang, to vigorously praise the emperors and generals of the past dynasties. He said: "The ruling class of our country in the past dynasties tried to take 'if one people are hungry, I am hungry, if one people are cold, I am cold' as the fundamental principle of caring for the people." He used more than 300 pages, from the emperors of the Qin and Han dynasties to Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, to praise them for how they cared for the people, engaged in "relief," "giving porridge," "raising pensions," "redeeming sons," "righteous granaries," "peaceful rice sales," "tax exemption and rent reduction," and "eliminating harm," as well as engaging in "water conservancy," "afforestation," and other "merits." He even praised Li Hongzhang, a traitor at the end of the Qing Dynasty and an executioner who massacred the revolutionary people of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, saying that "Li Hongzhang also often ordered various prefectures, states, and counties to advise the people to open wells." In order to beautify the emperors of the past, Deng Tuo talked a lot about the emperors reducing their meals in famine years. He cited 19 emperors from Emperor Xuan of the Han Dynasty to Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty on how they "reduced meals," "reduced supplies," "stopped drinking," "withdrew music," "reduced horses," and "changed clothes" due to disasters. And he said: "The wise emperors are always diligent in saving, which can be seen in general."
    Deng Tuo's beautification of the emperors and generals of the past dynasties was ultimately aimed at beautifying Chiang Kai-shek. He repeatedly declared that the Kuomintang reactionary government inherited the practices of the past wise kings and greatly surpassed them. He said that "the work relief since the Republic of China has actually benefited the disaster victims more than in previous generations." Deng Tuo praised the "Seven-Province Locust Control Conference" convened by the Kuomintang reactionary government in 1934 in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Hunan, Henan, and Zhejiang, "opening a new page in the history of locust control in our country." He praised the counter-revolutionary head Song Ziwen for "personally inspecting water conservancy in the Northwest." He completely said in the tone of a Kuomintang member that what "Zhong Zhen, member of the Central Committee" (member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, deputy speaker of the puppet Legislative Yuan) said was "correct." He even unreservedly praised Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "On October 22, 1933, the chairman of the Military Commission of the National Government convened a ten-province food conference in Nanjing, and one of the resolutions was to build granaries. On November 22, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Executive Yuan to find out and handle it, and since then, the provinces began to store grain." Chiang Kai-shek plundered people's grain, stored it in warehouses, and used it to carry out anti-people civil wars, which Deng Tuo also praised as a good thing. Deng Tuo praised the emperors of the past and Chiang Kai-shek with two or three hundred pages, and in the end, he made a 15-page record of major famine relief events to praise the feudal emperors of the past and Chiang Kai-shek again. In short, Deng Tuo depicted the man-eating demons of the past and Chiang Kai-shek as "living Buddhas" and "saviors."
    Deng Tuo's lies praising the emperors of the past dynasties and Chiang Kai-shek completely concealed the bloody facts of the landlords, nobles, emperors, and Chiang Kai-shek's cruel oppression of the vast number of peasants, and could not conceal their cannibalistic nature. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "The feudal ruling classes—landlords, nobles, and emperors—owned the largest part of the land, while the peasants owned very little land, or no land at all. The peasants used their own tools to cultivate the land of the landlords, nobles, and royal families, and dedicated 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or even more than 80% of the harvest to the landlords, nobles, and royal families for their enjoyment." "Not only did the landlords, nobles, and royal families rely on exploiting the rent of the peasants to live, but the state of the landlord class also forced the peasants to pay tribute and forced the peasants to engage in unpaid labor to support a large group of state officials and armies mainly used to suppress the peasants." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") The peasants of China in the past dynasties lived a poor and miserable slave-like life under this feudal economic exploitation and feudal political oppression. Isn't this clear? It was precisely because the landlords, nobles, and emperors only knew how to exploit the peasants and did not care about the life or death of the peasants at all that 65.78 million people died of disasters in the famine years of Daoguang 26, Xianfeng 7, and Guangxu 2, 3, 4, and 14 of the Qing Dynasty.
    Deng Tuo would say that I am all based on what the books say. Yes, but the so-called books you are based on are all edicts of emperors of the past dynasties, memorials of ministers, and reports of the Kuomintang government. These things don't tell the truth at all. They are all carefully fabricated to deceive the people and serve the interests of the reactionary ruling class.
    Sometimes, in order to maintain its rule, the reactionary ruling class also engages in some relief to pretend to win over the hearts of the people. But even this little relief could not reach the poor people at all, and was embezzled by landlords and bureaucrats.
    Regarding the fact that the feudal government not only did not relieve disasters but also created disasters, Su Shi had a description in "On the Situation of Accumulated Debts," he said: "When I visited the villages of relatives and elders, they all had sad faces, saying: A good year is not as good as a bad year. When natural disasters are prevalent, even if the people lack food, they can still survive by shrinking their clothes and saving their mouths. If it is a good year, when accumulated debts are urged, the officials are at the door, and the shackles are on their bodies, then the people cannot seek death. After saying this, tears fell, and I couldn't help but cry. Also, there are many refugees in the cities I went to. The officials all said that because the summer wheat is ripe, accumulated debts are urged, so the refugees dare not return to their hometowns. I have heard that Confucius said: Harsh government is fiercer than a tiger. I used to disbelieve it, but now I see it, it is almost worse! Water and drought kill people a hundred times more than tigers; but people fear urging debts even more than water and drought. I secretly estimate that there are no less than 500 officials and soldiers urging debts in each state. In the world, there are always more than 200,000 tigers and wolves scattered among the people. How can the people live in peace?" The situation revealed in this article by a feudal scholar who was not really speaking for the people is enough to expose Deng Tuo's lies.
    The emperor's "giving porridge" that Deng Tuo praised so much was also a completely deceptive ghost story. The "Comprehensive Examination of Documents" said: In the eighth year of Qingli, there was a great disaster. The government asked the starving people to go to the city to receive thin porridge. As a result, "the starving people gathered into epidemics, and they trampled each other to death. Or they waited for several days without food, and they all fell down stiff after getting porridge. It is called saving people, but it is actually killing them."
    Regarding the "righteous granary" praised by Deng Tuo, Qin Huitian of the Qing Dynasty said: "The so-called righteous granary is nominally for preparing for famine, but in fact it is just increasing taxes." ("Comprehensive Examination of the Five Rites")
    The "peaceful rice sales" praised by Deng Tuo was completely a means for landlords and bureaucrats to collude together to exploit the peasants. The government "colluded with hoarding families to cheat. When the harvest was about to come and the farmers urgently needed money to sell rice, they deliberately underestimated the price and did not allow the government to collect rice, but hoarded it into the hoarding families. Until it was overdue, the hoarding families' granaries were full, and then they suddenly increased the price of grain and collected it into the government. Therefore, farmers only got a cheap price for selling grain, and the government often used a high price to buy grain, and the high profits all went to the hoarding families." ("Zizhi Tongjian")
    The "transporting millet to the government" praised by Deng Tuo was a dirty and ugly drama of landlords and bureaucrats colluding with each other to get promoted and make a fortune. The method of "transporting millet to the government" was implemented from the Qin Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. For example, the Qin Dynasty stipulated that "the people who donated a thousand stones of grain to save the disaster will be granted a title of one level"; the Qing Dynasty stipulated that "those who donate one hundred stones of rice or two hundred taels of silver will be given a ninth-rank hat, and those who donate more will be given a higher title." Who has rice and silver to donate in the famine year? Of course, it is the big landlords who live by exploitation. This is the landlords and the government taking advantage of the disaster to raise the banner of "disaster relief," one selling officialdom and making a fortune, and the other buying officialdom and making a fortune, and the suffering is in the people.
    As for the rural areas during the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the set of old methods of feudal landlord exploitation was added to the foreign methods of imperialist plunder, which caused greater disasters to the people. According to incomplete statistics, from 1920 to 1936, as many as 18.35 million Chinese people died of disasters. Can this be said that Chiang Kai-shek cared about the people's lives?
    Didn't Deng Tuo say in the "Introduction" that he wanted to "explore the therapeutic principles and approaches of sociology"? What are his "principles" and "approaches"? Is it revolution? No, Deng Tuo didn't even mention the word revolution, but cursed the revolution instead. After talking about the disasters and their impact in China in the past dynasties, he used more than 300 pages to praise the "thoughts" and "policies" of the emperors of the past and Chiang Kai-shek in famine relief. After talking about these reactionary thoughts and policies, the book was finished. Obviously, Deng Tuo's "principles" and "approaches" are the feudal, that is, Chiang Kai-shek's "thoughts" and "policies." This is the "approach" pointed out by Deng Tuo, this counter-revolutionary element, to the Chinese people. In addition to not allowing the people to revolt, this book by Deng Tuo has another important purpose, which is to offer advice and suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek. He listed the facts of more than 150 peasant uprisings of all sizes in the past dynasties to remind Chiang Kai-shek: "The final development of the large-scale peasant uprising army is often enough to subvert the old feudal regime." He earnestly appealed to Chiang Kai-shek to follow the example of the "wise kings," adopt the "theories of tax reduction, rent reduction, encouraging agriculture, and eliminating disasters" of the "Confucians of the past dynasties," and implement measures such as "developing transportation, removing customs barriers, eliminating exploitation, eliminating encroachment and deception, prohibiting closed rice sales, and strictly guaranteeing the armor" to prevent "disasters from leading to economic collapse" and "social upheaval." The rule of the four major families headed by Chiang Kai-shek was based on the most cruel exploitation and oppression of the working people. Isn't it absurd to ask Chiang Kai-shek to "eliminate exploitation" and "eliminate encroachment and deception"? Saying those two sentences is nothing but deceiving people. Only developing transportation, especially strictly guaranteeing the armor, in order to help Chiang Kai-shek strangle the revolution and consolidate Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, is the real purpose of Deng Tuo, this traitor.
    IV. Bitter Hatred and Vicious Slander of the People's Revolution
    Deng Tuo spared no effort to praise and sing the praises of the enemies of the people—the emperors of the past, imperialism, and Chiang Kai-shek—while being bitterly hateful and viciously slandering the people's revolution.
    First, he completely cursed the peasant uprisings more than 150 times as "roving bandits," "thieves," "evil bandits," "bandit disasters," and "rebellions" in the tone of the reactionaries. He cursed the Communist Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army as "bandits," and called the counter-revolutionary massacre that Chiang Kai-shek carried out against the people "suppression of bandits," "suppression of the Red Army," and "annihilation of the Red Zone."
    Second, he slandered the revolutionary war as "directly destroying the productive forces" and the cause of disasters. Chairman Mao said that the revolutionary war "is the real driving force of historical development," but Deng Tuo said that "the civil strife in our country's history, including the revolutionary war... directly destroys the social productive forces, which is far-reaching."
    Third, he slandered the Communist Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army for destroying and hindering famine relief. When he promoted the Kuomintang's so-called "storing grain for disaster relief," he said that in 1933, "Sangzhi in Hunan did not store grain due to banditry," and that the grain storage in Fujian was also "eight counties that had not reported bandit disasters."
    Fourth, he slandered the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution for destroying forests and causing disasters. While vigorously promoting Chiang Kai-shek's "achievements" in afforestation, he said: "When the Hong and Yang Incident broke out, the mountains and forests in our country's mainland were almost completely destroyed by the war, and only a few areas remained."
    Fifth, he cursed the peasants as "lazy." While promoting how the emperor "personally plowed the royal fields" and the emperor's wife "personally raised silkworms," he cursed the laborers who really created wealth, saying: "The people are lazy and complacent," "the foolish people are accustomed to laziness."
    Sixth, he slandered the peasants for "wasting" "storage" and making it difficult to survive the famine. He described the emperor, who spent hundreds of taels of silver on a meal, as "diligent in saving," "not willing to discard even a grain of rice." While praising how the emperor "reduced meals" in the famine year, he slandered that the disasters were due to the peasants' "lack of savings in peacetime and their extravagance and waste in peacetime, which is a major cause of empty savings." Please ask Deng Tuo, the peasants' production income is completely deprived, so what can they save?
    Seventh, he slandered the backwardness of China's agricultural technology as due to the "stupidity" of the peasants. Chairman Mao said: "The extreme poverty and backwardness of the peasants caused by the cruel exploitation and oppression of the landlord class is the fundamental reason for the economic and social stagnation of Chinese society for thousands of years." It is the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie that "obstruct the development of China's productive forces." (See "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Deng Tuo said: "The agricultural cultivation technology in the vast majority of rural areas is still the same as it was thousands of years ago. It has been passed down from generation to generation and has never been abandoned. Sometimes there is a phenomenon of degradation. With this kind of stagnant and backward agricultural technology, it is not enough to overcome natural disasters. This is the constant sigh and regret of technical experts of the past dynasties for the stupidity of Chinese farmers." Look at Deng Tuo's fallacy. The failure to overcome disasters is due to the backwardness of agricultural technology, and the backwardness of agricultural technology is due to the "stupidity of the peasants." Here, Deng Tuo both covers up the crimes of the exploiting class and slanders the peasants.
    In short, Deng Tuo praises and sings the praises of the emperors of the past, imperialism, and Chiang Kai-shek, while being fierce and venomous towards the people.
    V. Reprinting this Book Twice in 1958 and 1961 to Frenziedly Attack the Party and Socialism
    Chairman Mao said: Class enemies are bound to look for opportunities to show themselves. This is a truly true truth. It is said that Deng Tuo's counter-revolutionary book written in 1937 would not be released again after liberation. No, after liberation, he reprinted it, and reprinted it twice. Why? Because he wants to be counter-revolutionary. His reprinting in 1958 and 1961, not sooner or later, was also the timing he carefully sought. He made it clear in "Writing in Front of the Reprinted Edition" written in August 1957 that the reprint "is to adapt to objective needs." What objective needs to adapt to? It turned out that in 1957, the bourgeois rightists and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements united to frenziedly attack the Party and socialism. Deng Tuo adapted to the "objective needs" of this small group of demons and monsters who opposed the Party and socialism. He hurriedly slightly modified it, cut out some of the too blatant reactionary things, in Deng Tuo's words, "first made technical modifications," and threw it out to participate in the anti-Party and anti-socialist chorus.
    Deng Tuo, this counter-revolutionary element and big rightist, fortunately escaped the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, but he did not abandon his counter-revolutionary plan, but hid in the corner of conspiracy and waited for the opportunity. In 1961, our country suffered from particularly severe natural disasters, and class enemies at home and abroad cooperated with each other to launch a frenzied attack. Deng Tuo believed that his great counter-revolutionary opportunity had come again, so he once again adapted to the "objective needs" of these counter-revolutionaries and reprinted the counter-revolutionary book "A History of Famine Relief in China" to frenziedly attack the Party and socialism. And while reprinting this book and afterwards, "Yanshan Night Talk," "Notes from Three-Family Village," and other demons and monsters also came out one after another. He attempted to take advantage of the "opportunity" of our country encountering natural disasters to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, restore capitalism in China, and re-establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. "The reactionaries will not fall if they are not beaten down." They will never give up until the day they die. "Disturb—fail—disturb again—fail again, until destruction" is the logic of all reactionaries, and it is also the logic of Deng Tuo, this counter-revolutionary element. For these reactionaries, only by thoroughly eliminating them can they be thoroughly comfortable.
    Now all of Deng Tuo's beautiful dreams are over. The Party has led the people to overcome the three years of natural disasters and built our great motherland so strong and beautiful as never before. Deng Tuo has gained nothing, but has exposed his fox tail. The people have dragged out this traitor who has been hiding in the Party for a long time, and the consistently anti-Communist and anti-people counter-revolutionary element. This time, we must thoroughly defeat him and never allow him to make waves again.

    邓拓反共反人民反革命决不是偶然的。他的反革命行径由来已久。早在一九三七年他写的《中国救荒史》，就把他的反革命丑恶面
  目完全暴露出来了。他那时虽然挂着共产党员的牌子，干的却是反共反人民反革命的勾当。他竭力歪曲历史，制造反革命谬论，掩盖
  中国社会的基本矛盾，美化历代封建帝王，美化帝国主义，美化反革命头子蒋介石。他恶毒地咒骂历次农民暴动，诬蔑共产党及其领导的工农红军，向蒋介石献计献策，妄图绞杀革命，巩固蒋介石的反革命统治。这本书一九三七年由商务印书馆出版（署名“邓云特”），漆布精装，收入反革命头目王云五主编的《中国文化史丛书》，作为这套丛书的第二辑，可见其受反动政权欣赏的程度。更为可恶的是，邓拓这个老叛徒居然在一九五八年和一九六一年又两次重印放毒。这就充分说明了邓拓反共反人民反革命活动的一贯性。现在我们来看看邓拓是怎样通过这本书来进行反共反人民反革命活动的。
    一、掩盖中国社会的基本矛盾，制造反革命谬论
    邓拓在这本书的《绪言》中宣称：他写“救荒史非仅为叙述一般事实之历史，且应为一社会病态史及社会病源学史”，“藉以探求社会学之治疗原则与途径”。请看，邓拓对旧中国的“病态”、“病源”，是怎样“诊断”的呢？
    邓拓把中国社会的基本问题说成是“水、旱、蝗、风、地震、疫、霜、雪等灾害”。他用六十页的篇幅来渲染中国灾荒的“普遍性”
  （即“无年不灾”、“无处不灾”）、“连续性”和“积累性”，说“我国灾荒之多，世罕其匹”。他甚至完全学着帝国主义腔调，诬蔑中国为“饥荒之国度”。他把一切问题都归之于由灾荒造成的。他说：“灾荒最严重发展之最主要结果，即为社会之变乱”。灾荒是造成“农村劳动力减少”、“全国耕地激减”的“最直接最基本而最重要的原因”，灾荒是造成中国人口“最高死亡率之一主要原因”，“灾荒最直接之结果，即造成整个农村经济之崩溃，使国民经济之基础根本颠覆”。他还说：“累次发生之农民暴动，无论其范围之大小，其时间之久暂，实无一而非由灾荒所促发，即无一不以灾年为背景，殆已成为历史之公例”，“几为不可逾越之定律”。他甚至把“异民族之侵入”、“民族之间的战争”，也都说成是由灾荒造成的，说什么“异民族之侵入，往往即为灾荒之直接结果也”。总之，邓拓把灾荒说成是中国社会一切问题的症结所在。那么抗日战争之前，中国近代史上的灾荒又是怎么造成的呢？他根本不提帝国主义侵略和蒋介石反动统治给人民造成的灾难（只是轻描淡写地说了几句封建剥削），却胡说什么农民“愚蠢”、“懒惰”、没有“储积”，“造成农业技术落后战不胜天灾”。他还大说特说中国的地理环境和气候变迁等自然条件造成了灾荒，而那些自然条件又是无法克服的。归结起来说，邓拓的理论，就是一切社会问题都由灾荒造成，而灾荒主要由自然灾害造成的。
    这真是弥天大谎。在邓拓笔下，阶级剥削没有了，民族压迫没有了，一部阶级斗争史，变成了一部“老天降灾史”与帝王将相以至蒋介石这些反动头子们的“救荒史”。这完全是反历史反科学的，是彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。
    毛主席早就指出，封建地主和农民的矛盾是封建社会的主要矛盾，历次农民革命正是由这个矛盾产生的。毛主席说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”怎么能说农民起义是由灾荒所引起的？自从帝国主义侵入中国以后，中国变为半殖民地半封建社会，中国经济、文化落后，人民贫困、破产、死亡的根本原因，是帝国主义和封建主义的双重压迫。帝国主义和中华民族的矛盾，封建主义和人民大众的矛盾，是近代中国社会的基本矛盾和主要矛盾。毛主席说：“伟大的近代和现代的中国革命，是在这些基本矛盾的基础之上发生和发展起来的。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）怎么能说这一切都是由灾荒造成的？
    造成灾荒固然有自然条件的原因，但主要还是由于帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石反动统治的掠夺压迫造成的。毛主席一九三○年就指出：“因为国家的赋税加重，地主的租息加重和战祸的日广一日，造成了普遍于全国的灾荒和匪祸，使得广大的农民和城市贫民走上求生不得的道路。”（《星星之火，可以燎原》）邓拓为什么把造成灾荒原因主要归之于自然条件，而只字不提帝国主义的掠夺，不揭露蒋介石反动统治给人民造成的灾害？
    邓拓诬蔑中国是“饥荒之国度”，说什么地理条件和人口众多，决定了中国人民过去、现在和将来要永远受“饥荒”。这简直是和前美国国务卿艾奇逊一九四九年说的完全是一个腔调！艾奇逊说：中国“人民的吃饭问题”，“一直到现在没有一个政府使这个问题得到了解决”。特别值得注意的是，艾奇逊的谬论早已为毛主席所驳斥，毛主席指出的“革命加生产即能解决吃饭问题的真理”早已为胜利后新中国所证实。而邓拓又在一九五八年和一九六一年再次抛出这个反动理论，用心之阴险难道还不很明显吗？
    邓拓的“灾荒论”和胡适的“五鬼（贫穷、疾病、愚昧、贪污、扰乱）闹中华”的谬论，完全是一路货色。其目的是为了掩盖中国社会的阶级矛盾，掩盖人民贫困破产的真正原因，掩盖帝国主义、封建主义和蒋介石反动派的滔天罪恶，企图欺骗人民，转移人民革命的目标，熄灭人民革命的火焰。这完全是适应蒋介石反动统治的需要。当时日本帝国主义要把中国变为它的殖民地，蒋介石的卖国独裁政策遭到全国人民反对，一个在中国共产党号召和领导下的革命高潮已经出现，蒋介石的反动统治处于惶惶不可终日的重重矛盾之中。在这种情况下，邓拓破门而出，公然为蒋介石开脱罪责，正是适应了蒋介石的需要。这充分暴露了邓拓这个革命叛徒的嘴脸。
    二、千方百计为帝国主义侵略打掩护
    邓拓这本书是一九三七年六月二日出版的，离“七七”事变只有一个月零五天。这时日本帝国主义已经侵占了我国东北四省，已经在华北搞了一个殷汝耕汉奸政府，并且在偷偷运兵，准备大举进攻中国，灭亡中国。这时中日矛盾已成为我国的主要矛盾。全国人民已经在中国共产党领导下掀起了抗日高潮，而蒋介石反动政府还在顽固地坚持卖国独裁政策。正在这民族生死存亡的紧要关头，挂着共产党员招牌的邓拓，却以研究中国“社会病态”和
  “社会病源”为题，写出了五百多页的《中国救荒史》，竟然只字不提帝国主义特别是日本帝国主义的侵略给中国人民造成的灾难，好象世界上根本没有帝国主义侵略中国，根本没有日本帝国主义要灭亡中国这件事似的。邓拓要为帝国主义打掩护不是一清二楚的吗？
    邓拓不仅掩饰帝国主义侵略，而且为帝国主义侵略作辩解，说什么“近代我国所受外力之侵略，……即为灾荒直接之结果也”，“灾荒之延长，消磨民族内在力量，内力不足，外力遂得以侵入，乃寻常之理也”。好一个“寻常之理也”，难道帝国主义侵略中国，不是由于帝国主义的本性决定的，而是由于中国灾荒决定的吗？难道中国的“内力”遭到摧残不正是由帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石的反动统治所造成的吗？难道中国遭受灾荒，帝国主义就应该侵略中国吗？难道日本帝国主义不费一枪一弹就侵占了我国东北三省，不是由于蒋介石卖国，而是由于中国灾荒造成的吗？这不是十足的汉奸理论又是什么呢？
    邓拓嫌这样为日本帝国主义效劳还不够，还进一步地美化美帝国主义。一九三一年和一九三三年，美帝国主义为了支持蒋介石“围剿”工农红军，给蒋介石两次“棉麦贷款”。邓拓竟然把美蒋联合屠杀人民的罪恶，宣扬为“美援小麦”对于“救济长江水灾”、“复兴皖赣两省农村”、“修复民堤”、“修复运河”起了巨大作用。大家知道，邓拓在这里所说的皖赣两省，即当时以井冈山为中心的江西革命根据地，和以大别山为中心的鄂豫皖革命根据地。当时工农红军在这两省解放了的地方，打土豪，分田地，“分田分地真忙”，使破产的农村走上了欣欣向荣的道路。美帝国主义在这里起的“巨大作用”不是别的，就是给蒋介石输血，帮助蒋介石镇压这些地方的革命。邓拓在这里歌颂的就是美帝国主义的这种反革命的作用。当时美帝国主义为了对中国进行掠夺，派了些帝国主义分子，与蒋介石联合搞了个“华洋义赈会”，这和今天美帝国主义到处派“和平队”，干的是一样的勾当。邓拓竟然把反革命的“华洋义赈会”，说成是“慈善团体”，大加颂扬。说它举办“农赈”、“工赈”“成绩甚佳”；说它在安徽、江西及黄河流域的灾荒中，“贷放美麦”施行“赈款”，说“灾农从中恢复农事及修筑房屋……获益不浅”。拼命把帝国主义的侵略罪恶说成是好事，邓拓这一副汉奸面孔不是赤裸裸的暴露出来了吗？
    三、竭力为历代封建帝王和蒋介石歌功颂
      德，为蒋介石献计献策
    邓拓从历代帝王诏书、百官臣僚的奏折和封建文人的著述，以及国民党官方文件中，搜罗了有关“救荒”的“言论”和“事例”，来大肆吹捧历代帝王将相。他说：“我国往代治者阶级尝以‘一民饥，曰我饥之，一民寒，曰我寒之’为恤民之根本原则”。他用了三百多页的篇幅，从秦汉皇帝一直到国民党蒋介石，吹捧他们如何关心人民，搞什么“赈济”、“施粥”、“养恤”、“赎子”、“义仓”、“平粜”、“免租减赋”、“除害”，以及搞“水利”“造林”等等的“功绩”。甚至把清末卖国贼、屠杀太平天国革命人民的刽子手李鸿章也加以吹捧，说“李鸿章亦常檄令各府、州、县劝民开井”。邓拓为了美化历代帝王，大讲皇帝荒年减膳。他从汉宣帝到明宪宗一连举了十九个皇帝如何因灾荒而“减膳”、“减供”、“断酒”、“撤乐”、“减马”、“变服”等等。并说：“圣明之君，孜孜以节约为事，于此亦可见其概略矣。”
    邓拓美化历代帝王将相，其最终目的还是为了美化蒋介石。他一再宣扬国民党反动政府继承了历代圣君明王的做法，并且大大超过了他们。他说“民国以来之工赈，其实惠于灾民者，当更胜于前代”。邓拓吹捧一九三四年国民党反动政府召集的苏、皖、鲁、冀、湘、豫、浙“七省治蝗会议”，“开我国治蝗史之新页”。他吹捧反革命头子宋子文“亲到西北考察水利”。他完全以国民党员的口吻说：“中委覃振”（国民党中央委员，伪立法院副院长）的话如何“正确”。他甚至毫不掩饰地颂扬蒋介石，说：“民国二十二年十月二十二日，国民政府军事委员会委员长始召集十省粮食会议于南京，决议中有兴办谷仓一项。十一月二十二日，遂由蒋委员长电行政院查明办理，自是各省始有积谷之举。”蒋介石搜刮民粮，屯积仓库，用以进行反人民内战，邓拓也当作好事加以颂扬。邓拓用二三百页篇幅大肆颂扬历代帝王和蒋介石还嫌不够，最后又弄了个十五页的救荒大事记，再来对历代封建帝王和蒋介石歌功颂德一番。总之，邓拓把历代帝王和蒋介石这些吃人魔王都描绘成了“活菩萨”和“救世主”了。
    邓拓那些为历代帝王和蒋介石歌功颂德的谎言，完全掩盖不了地主、贵族、皇帝、蒋介石残酷压榨广大农民的血淋淋的事实，掩盖不了他们吃人的本质。毛主席早就指出：“封建的统治阶级——地主、贵族和皇帝，拥有最大部分的土地，而农民则很少土地，或者完全没有土地。农民用自己的工具去耕种地主、贵族和皇室的土地，并将收获的四成、五成、六成、七成甚至八成以上，奉献给地主、贵族和皇室享用。”“不但地主、贵族和皇室依靠剥削农民的地租过活，而且地主阶级的国家又强迫农民缴纳贡税，并强迫农民从事无偿的劳役，去养活一大群的国家官吏和主要地是为了镇压农民之用的军队。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）中国历代的农民，就在这种封建的经济剥削和封建的政治压迫之下，过着贫穷困苦的奴隶式的生活，这不是清清楚楚吗？正因为地主、贵族、皇帝只知剥削农民而根本不顾农民的死活，所以在清朝道光二十六年、咸丰七年、光绪二、三、四、十四年等灾荒年中，人民死于灾荒的就有六千五百七十八万之多。
    邓拓会说，我都是根据书上说的呀。是的，不过你根据的所谓书，都是历代帝王的诏文、大臣的奏折和国民党政府的报告等等。这些东西都根本不说实话，都是为了欺骗人民而精心编造的，都是为反动统治阶级利益服务的。
    反动统治阶级有时为了维持他的统治的需要，也搞点救济装装样子以笼络民心。但就这一点点救济，也根本到不了贫穷人手里，就被地主官僚从中贪污中饱。
    关于封建政府不仅不救灾荒而且制造灾荒的问题，苏轼在《论积欠状》中有一段描写，他说：“亲人村落，访问父老，皆有忧色，云：丰年不如凶年，天灾流行，民虽乏食，缩衣节口，犹可以生。若丰年，举催积欠，胥徒在门，枷棒在身，则人户求死不得。言讫泪下，臣亦不觉流涕。又所至城邑，多有流民，官吏皆云以夏麦既熟，举催积欠，故流民不敢归乡。臣闻之，孔子曰：苛政猛于虎。昔常不信其言，以今观之，殆有甚者！水旱杀人，百倍于虎；而人畏催欠，乃甚于水旱。臣窃度之，每州催欠吏卒不下五百人，以天下言之，是常有二十余万虎狼散在民间，百姓何由安生？”从这个并非真正为人民说话的封建士大夫的文章里透露出来的这一点情况，就足够揭穿邓拓的谎话了。
    被邓拓大吹特吹的皇帝“施粥”，也完全是骗人的鬼话。《文献通考》中说：庆历八年大灾荒，官府叫饥民到城里去领稀粥，结果“饥民聚为疾疫，又相踏藉死，或待次数日不食，得粥皆僵仆。名为救人，而实杀之”。
    为邓拓所颂扬的“义仓”，清朝秦蕙田说：“所谓义仓者，名为备荒，实则加赋而已”。（《五礼通考》）
    为邓拓所颂扬的“平粜”，完全是地主和官僚勾结一起剥削农民的一种手段。官府“与蓄积之家通同作弊，当作收成之时，农人要钱急粜之时，故意小估价例，令官中收籴不得，蓄入蓄积之家。直至过时，蓄积之家仓廪盈满，方始顿添谷价，中籴入官。是以农夫粜谷止得贱价，官中籴谷常用贵价，厚利尽归蓄积之家”。（《资治通鉴》）
    为邓拓颂扬的“输粟纳官”，那是地主官僚互相勾结起来，升官发财的肮脏的丑剧。从秦朝到清朝实行过“输粟纳官”的办法。如秦朝规定，因救灾“百姓纳粟千石，拜爵一级”；清朝规定：“捐米一百石，或银二百两者，给九品顶戴，捐多者，递加职衔”。在灾荒年谁有米、银捐？当然是靠剥削为生的大地主。这就是地主与官府乘灾荒之机，打着“救灾”的旗号，一个卖官发财，一个买官再发财，苦在百姓。
    至于蒋介石反动统治时期的农村，则是封建地主剥削的一套土办法又加上帝国主义掠夺的洋办法，给人民造成了更大的灾难。据不完全统计，一九二○年到一九三六年，死于灾荒的中国人口就达一千八百三十五万之多。这难道能说蒋介石关心人民的生活吗？
    邓拓在《绪言》中不是说他要“探求社会学之治疗原则与途径”吗？他的“原则”和“途径”是什么？是革命吗？不，邓拓连一个字也没有谈到革命，相反把革命骂了一顿。他讲了中国历代灾情及影响之后，就用三百多页来颂扬历代帝王和蒋介石救荒的“思想”和“政策”。讲完了这些反动的思想和政策，书也就写完了。显然，邓拓的“原则”和“途径”就是封建的也就是蒋介石的“思想”和“政策”。这就是邓拓这个反革命分子给中国人民指出的“途径”。邓拓除了不准人民革命之外，他这本书还有一个重要目的，就是给蒋介石献计献策。他列举了历代大大小小一百五十多次农民起义的事实来提醒蒋介石：“规模较大之农民暴动军，其最后之发展，则往往足以颠覆旧有之封建政权”。他向蒋介石恳切陈辞，要蒋介石效法“圣明之君”，采纳“历朝诸儒”的“宽徭、减赋、劝农、消灾之论”，实行“兴交通，去关禁，除剥削，绝侵欺，禁闭籴、严保甲”等等措施，以防止“灾荒招致经济崩溃”和“社会变乱”。以蒋介石为首的四大家族的统治，就是建立在对劳动人民最残酷的剥削和压迫之上的，要蒋介石“除剥削”、“绝侵欺”岂非奇谈？说那么两句，无非是骗人。只有兴交通，特别是严保甲，借以帮助蒋介石绞杀革命，巩固蒋介石的反动统治，才是邓拓这个叛徒的真正目的。
    四、对人民革命刻骨仇恨恶毒诬蔑
    邓拓对人民的敌人——历代帝王、帝国主义和蒋介石极力吹捧，歌功颂德，而对人民革命则是刻骨仇恨和恶毒诬蔑。
    第一，他完全以反动派的腔调，连续一百五十多次骂农民起义为“流寇”、“盗贼”、“妖盗”、“匪祸”、“叛变”。他咒骂共产党和工农红军是“匪”，把蒋介石向人民实行的反革命屠杀，称为“剿匪”、“讨赤”、“歼灭赤区”。
    第二，他诬蔑革命战争“直接摧毁生产力”，是造成灾荒的原因。毛主席说革命战争“是历史发展的真正动力”，邓拓却说
  “我国历史上的内乱，包括革命战争……直接摧毁社会之生产力，实为深远”。
    第三，他诬蔑共产党和工农红军破坏、阻碍救荒，他在宣扬国民党的所谓“积谷救灾”时说：一九三三年湖南就是“桑植因匪患未办积谷”，说福建积谷也是有“匪祸未报者八县”。
    第四，他诬蔑太平天国革命破坏森林，造成灾荒。他在大肆宣扬蒋介石植林“功绩”的同时，说：“洪、杨事起，兵火摧残，我国本土山林，已毁伐将尽，所留者仅少数区域”。
    第五，他咒骂农民“懒惰”。他在宣扬皇帝如何“亲耕籍田”，皇帝老婆如何“亲蚕桑”的同时，把真正创造财富的劳动者横加咒骂，说：“小民怠惰偷安”，“愚民习于懒惰”。
    第六，他诬蔑农民“浪费”“储积”而难以度荒。他把一顿饭要上百两银子挥金如土的皇帝说成是“孜孜以节约为事”，“虽粒米不肯抛弃”，他在颂扬皇帝荒年如何“减膳”的同时，却诬蔑灾荒是由于农民“平日之无积蓄，同时又知平日之奢靡浪费，为积蓄空虚之大因”。请问邓拓，农民生产所得全被剥夺净尽，还拿什么储积？
    第七，他把中国农业技术落后诬蔑为由于农民“愚蠢”。毛主席说：“地主阶级这样残酷的剥削和压迫所造成的农民极端穷苦和落后，就是中国社会几千年在经济上和社会生活上停滞不前的基本原因”。是地主阶级和官僚资产阶级“阻碍中国生产力的发展”。（见《中国革命和中国共产党》）邓拓却说：“最大多数农村中之农业耕种技术，仍一如数千年前之状态，累世相传，未尝放弃，有时且有退化之现象，以此种停滞落后之农业技术，自不足以克服自然之灾害。此历来技术专门家之不断嗟叹惋惜于中国农民之愚蠢也。”请看邓拓的谬论，灾荒之不能克服是由于农业技术落后，而农业技术落后则是由于“农民之愚蠢也”。邓拓在这里，既掩盖剥削阶级的罪恶，又诬蔑了农民。
    总之，邓拓对历代帝王、帝国主义和蒋介石是歌功颂德，对人民则是凶相毕露，满嘴喷毒。
    五、一九五八年和一九六一年两次重印这本书向党向社会主义猖狂进攻
    毛主席说：阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。真是千真万确的真理。邓拓一九三七年写的反革命书，按说解放以后不会再放出笼了吧。不，解放后，他还是重印了，而且重印两次。为什么？因为他要反革命。他所以不迟不早在一九五八年和一九六一年重印，那也是他精心寻找的时机。他在一九五七年八月写的《写在重印本的前面》中说得很明白，重印“是为了适应客观的需要”。适应什么客观需要？原来一九五七年资产阶级右派和地富反坏联合起来向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，邓拓就是适应这一小撮牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义的“客观需要”。他急急忙忙稍加修饰，把那些太露骨的反动东西砍掉了一些，按邓拓的话说“先做技术性的修改”，就抛出来，参加反党反社会主义的大合唱。
    邓拓这个反革命分子、大右派，在一九五七年反右斗争中侥幸漏网了，但他并没放弃他的反革命计划，而是躲在阴谋的角落里，等待时机。一九六一年我国遭到特大自然灾害，国内外阶级敌人，纷纷互相配合发动了猖狂进攻，邓拓认为他的反革命大好时机又来了，于是又适应这些反革命的“客观需要”，再次重印《中国救荒史》这本反革命的书，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。并且在重印这本书的同时及以后，《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》等等牛鬼蛇神也纷纷出笼了。他企图借我国遇到自然灾害的“时机”推翻无产阶级专政，使资本主义在中国复辟，重新建立资产阶级专政。“反动派不打不倒”，他们直到他们的灭亡之日，是绝不死心的。“捣乱——失败——再捣乱——再失败，直至灭亡”是一切反动派的逻辑，也是邓拓这个反革命分子的逻辑。对于这些反动派只有把他们彻底消灭，他们才彻底舒服。
    现在邓拓的一切美梦都完蛋了，党领导人民战胜了三年自然灾害，并且把我们伟大的祖国建设得从来没有这样富强和美丽。邓拓什么也没捞到，倒是把狐狸尾巴露出来了。人民把这个长期暗藏在党内的叛徒，一贯反共反人民的反革命分子揪出来了。这回我们一定要把他彻底打倒，再也不允许他兴风作浪。
