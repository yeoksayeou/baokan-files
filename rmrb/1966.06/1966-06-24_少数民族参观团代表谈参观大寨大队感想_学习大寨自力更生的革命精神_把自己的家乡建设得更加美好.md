    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st – The minority nationalities visiting group, composed of 231 representatives from more than 30 ethnic groups, unanimously agreed after visiting the Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and learning the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance from the people of Dazhai can we build our hometowns even more beautifully.
    The representatives of this visiting group, organized by the Nationalities Affairs Commission, came from fifteen provinces and autonomous regions. The vast majority of the visiting group representatives are grassroots cadres from people's communes and production brigades in mountainous areas, pastoral areas, and border regions. Many of them are activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. The representatives of the visiting group visited the basic agricultural construction in Dazhai, listened to the report by Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, and also participated in field labor with the Dazhai commune members. That evening, the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members of Dazhai decided to call the plots of land labored on by the fraternal nationalities "Fraternal Nationalities Gully" and "Fraternal Nationalities Field." Chen Yonggui said happily, there are Dazhai fields all over the country, and Dazhai also has fields of fraternal nationalities.
    The representatives of the visiting group felt that they received a great deal of education in Dazhai. Suolang Zhaxi, a Tibetan serf who had been emancipated, said: "To build Tibet into a new Tibet, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance. In the future, we must learn the hard-bone spirit of the people of Dazhai, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and build our hometown even more beautifully." Chen Wenchang, a representative of the Bouyei nationality from Guizhou Province and secretary of the commune Party committee, said: "This time, we learned four magic weapons from Dazhai: First, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way and arm all commune members with Mao Zedong Thought; second, we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to give prominence to politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; third, we must work hard and rely on our own efforts, and cadres must take the lead in everything; fourth, we must have a strong leading body, and the branch must play a core role."
    After visiting Dazhai, the minority nationalities visiting group also visited Yuxian County, an advanced unit in the country in learning from and catching up with Dazhai. Later, they also visited the Taiyuan Huaguang Shoe Polish Factory, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, and the Jiajiazhuang Brigade of the Wannianqing Commune in Fenyang County. The representatives also made a special trip to visit the Liu Hulan Martyr Mausoleum.

    少数民族参观团代表谈参观大寨大队感想
    学习大寨自力更生的革命精神
    把自己的家乡建设得更加美好
    新华社太原二十一日电  由三十多个民族的二百三十一名代表组成的少数民族参观团，最近到山西省昔阳县大寨大队参观后一致认为，只有高举毛泽东思想红旗，学习大寨人艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，才能把自己的家乡建设得更美好。
    由民族事务委员会组织的这个参观团的代表，来自十五个省、自治区。他们在九日到山西省昔阳县大寨大队参观访问。参观团的代表们绝大多数是山区、牧区和边疆地区人民公社、生产大队的基层干部。他们当中许多是学习毛主席著作积极分子。参观团的代表在大寨参观了农田基本建设，听了大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵的报告，还和大寨社员一起参加了田间劳动。大寨的贫农下中农社员当晚就决定将兄弟民族劳动过的地块称为“兄弟民族沟”和“兄弟民族田”。陈永贵高兴地说，全国都有大寨田，大寨也有兄弟民族的田。
    参观团的代表们感到，他们在大寨受到了不少教育。西藏翻身农奴索郎扎西说：“要把西藏建设成一个新的西藏，要靠毛泽东思想，靠艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神。今后我们要学习大寨人的硬骨头精神，听毛主席的话，把我们家乡建设得更美好。”贵州省布依族代表、公社党委书记陈文昌说：“这次来大寨学到了四个法宝：首先要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装全体社员；二要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗；三要艰苦奋斗，自力更生，干部处处要起带头作用；四要有一个坚强的领导班子，支部要起到核心作用。”
    少数民族参观团在大寨参观访问后，还到全国学赶大寨的先进单位盂县去参观访问，后来又参观了太原华光鞋油社、太原重型机器厂，以及汾阳县万年青公社贾家庄大队。代表们还专程参观了刘胡兰烈士陵园。
