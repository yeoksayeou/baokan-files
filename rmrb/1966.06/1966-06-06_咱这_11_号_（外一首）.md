    Our "No. 11" (and another poem)
    Soldier of a certain unit of the PLA in Guangdong Province, Lü Linqing
Climbing sword peaks, walking treacherous paths, tanks and cars stare in amazement;
Trampling mountains, wading through water, stepping through thorns, soldiers exclusively ride "No. 11".
Driving yourself, sitting yourself, safe, insured, and reliable;
Running hundreds of miles a day without fatigue, venturing into deep mountains at night with a good sense of direction.
Red heart beating – the eternally rotating motor;
Boiling blood – the endlessly flowing “fuel”.
Climbing snow mountains, crossing grasslands, iron feet tread out the road to victory!
A million strong army marched south of the Yangtze River, red flags flying, war songs soaring!
Chasing and annihilating fleeing enemies, it opens the throttle and runs forward;
Seizing the position, it competes with the enemy for every second.
Whenever news of battle victories comes, people's smiling faces are brighter than flowers;
Dare you say that in this laughter of victory, there is no contribution from it? …
The older generation conquered the world, relying on this "No. 11";
The younger generation protects the country, even more so must carry forward the "family treasure".
The heavy burden of world revolution, relies on the shoulders of our soldiers;
Hey! With the four volumes of "Golden Books" in hand, our "No. 11" will not break down on the "Long March"!

    New Recruit Shooting Practice
Stepping on the spring breeze, draped in the morning glow;
With tiger steps and accompanying war songs, new recruits practice shooting past the mountain depression.
Spring flowers smile a welcome, small birds chirp on the branches;
Ten thousand acres of fertile fields, rice waving, earnestly offering words:
  "New comrades-in-arms, the beautiful rivers and mountains are picturesque;
But don't forget outside the gate, vicious wolves sharpen their fangs day and night..."
Soldiers firmly remember Chairman Mao's words: The enemy will not fall unless they are struck!
With the world in their hearts and a gun in their hands, they kill the enemy with a belly full of hatred!
Furious bullets are loaded into the chamber, raise the gun, aim carefully, and fire skillfully;
Three thunderous sounds ring beyond the sky, a bowl-sized red flower is pinned on the chest!
A bowl-sized red flower is pinned on the chest, delighting the small Zhao Xinhua;
Grinning at the company commander: "Dealing with the American devils, like catching turtles in a water tank!"

### 咱这“11号”（外一首）

    咱这“11号”（外一首）
    广东解放军某部战士　吕林清登剑峰，走险道，坦克汽车瞪眼瞧；踏山踏水踏荆棘，战士专乘“11号”。自己驾驶自己坐，安全保险又牢靠；日奔百里不知累，夜闯深山方向好。红心跃动——永恒转动的马达；热血沸腾——长流不息的“燃料”。爬雪山，过草地，铁脚踏出胜利道！百万雄师下江南，红旗翻飞战歌飘！追歼逃敌，它开足马力向前跑；抢占阵地呀，它与敌人争分秒。每当战斗的捷报传来，人们的笑脸比鲜花还俏；你敢说，这胜利的欢笑中，就没有它的一份功劳？……前辈打天下，靠这“11号”；后代保江山呵，更要发扬“传家宝”。世界革命千斤担，靠咱战士两肩挑；嘿！四卷“金书”捧在
  手，咱这“11号”呀，“长征”路上不抛锚！
    新兵打靶脚踏春风，身披早霞；虎步噔噔伴战歌，新兵打靶过山洼。春花朵朵笑相迎，小鸟枝头叫喳喳；万顷良田稻摆浪，语重心长把话拉：
  “新战友呵，锦绣河山美如画；可别忘了大门外，恶狼日夜磨残牙……”战士牢记主席语：敌人不打不会垮！心怀天下枪在手，满腔仇恨把敌杀！愤怒的子弹推上膛，举枪细瞄巧击发；霹雳三声响天外，碗大红花胸口挂！碗大红花胸口挂呵，喜坏了小个赵新华；对着连长咧嘴笑：“对付美国佬呀，水缸里抓王八！”
