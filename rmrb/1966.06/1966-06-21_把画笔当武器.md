Title: Using the Paintbrush as a Weapon

　　I am Du Zhilian, a poor peasant commune member from the Beibanzhuyuan Production Team of the Yuchan Commune in Hu County, Shaanxi. Before liberation, generations of my family toiled as hired laborers for landlords. I myself worked as a hired hand for a landlord for two years. Only after liberation did my family completely turn over. Therefore, whenever I think of the suffering in the old society, I feel even more deeply the sweetness of the new society.

　　I loved to paint since I was little. But how could a poor child in the old society who couldn't even afford pants dare to dream of painting? I never imagined that after liberation I could pick up a paintbrush and learn to paint. This is entirely thanks to the Party. In 1961, the county cultural center ran an art training class in our village. The Party branch secretary asked me to sign up, and I was so happy that I didn't sleep well all night. I thought to myself: I couldn't learn to paint in the old society, but the Party wants me to learn in the new society, so I must learn well and also turn over in painting!

　　Chairman Mao said that revolutionary literature and art should become “a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and eliminating the enemy.” We don't paint for the sake of painting; we must use the paintbrush in our hands as a weapon to protect our good country and the seal of power of us poor and lower-middle peasants. There was a landlord element in our village named Yang Jianzhang, who also knew how to paint a little. In 1962, when the US-Chiang clique was clamoring to counterattack the mainland, he painted two door gods on the gate of his house and also painted "Zhong Kui Expelling Demons" and "Qilin Bringing a Child" on the walls inside the house. When I saw these paintings, I knew that this guy had ill intentions. I reported the situation to the Party branch of the brigade. The secretary said, "It's no small matter that class enemies are painting pictures that promote reactionary ideas. We must expose his tricks and find ways to strengthen our socialist ideological front in the countryside." So, I painted works such as "Harvest Picture" and "The People's Commune is Good" and posted them on the gate of the poor and lower-middle peasants directly opposite Yang Jianzhang's house. The masses praised my paintings after seeing them, believing that my paintings overwhelmed the landlord's paintings and won honor for the poor and lower-middle peasants.

　　Chairman Mao told us that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and be utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The subjects I paint are all about things in the village. In 1963, when the Party called on painters to write history, I painted a set of family history for the old poor peasant Xia Caihua. At the exhibition, old woman Xia Caihua explained her begging life in the old society to the people with tears on her face, which played a great educational role. There were several girls in the No. 1 team of our village who worked very diligently and were quick at their work. I took the time to paint a "Mu Guiying Planting Seedlings" and posted it on the blackboard newspaper to commend them. The masses said after seeing it, "These girls are really doing a good job and should be commended." From then on, they became even more active in working.

　　Since I engaged in amateur art creation, I have always insisted on working while creating; working in the fields during the day and painting at home at night, and I have never delayed work because of painting. The year before last, our village held an exhibition of Lei Feng's deeds, and I was asked to leave production to paint comic strips. I thought that painting must not affect production, so I got up early every day to work in the fields, worked harder in the fields, and finished most of a day's work in half a day. After finishing work, I came back and painted until late at night. At that time, the captain wanted to give me work points from the team. I said, "I came here to do propaganda, not to ask for work points." And I refused. I said, "If we paint Lei Feng, we must learn from Lei Feng. Painting is also revolution."

　　In the practice of amateur art creation, I have come to realize that if I want to truly use my creation as a weapon of struggle, I must be a thorough revolutionary myself. In order to promote my own revolutionization, I often study Chairman Mao's works and keep Chairman Mao's teachings firmly in mind. I also wrote these four lines of poetry in front of my desk: Chairman Mao's works are the lighthouse, serving politics is firmly remembered, attacking the enemy is a weapon, and educating the people is a great effect.

### 把画笔当武器

    把画笔当武器
    陕西户县玉蝉公社社员　杜志廉
    我是陕西户县玉蝉公社北斑竹园生产队的贫农社员。解放前，我家里年老几辈都给地主拉长工。我也给地主家拉了两年长工。解放后，我家才彻底翻了身。所以我每想到旧社会的苦，就更感到新社会的甜。
    从小我就爱画。可是一个在旧社会连裤子都穿不上的穷娃娃，咋敢想画画。我真是做梦也没想到解放后我也能拿起画笔学画画了。这完全是党给我的。一九六一年，县文化馆在俺村办美术训练班。党支部书记要我报名参加，我高兴得一夜没有睡好觉。心里想：旧社会咱不能学画，新社会党叫咱学，咱一定要学好，在画画上也翻个身！
    毛主席说过，革命的文艺应该成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。我们画画也不是为画而画，是要把咱手中的画笔当做武器，来保住咱的好江山，保住咱贫下中农的印把子。俺村有个地主分子杨建章，这人也会画两笔画。一九六二年正当美蒋叫嚣反攻大陆的时候，他在自己家的大门上画了两张门神，又在屋里墙上画了《钟馗驱鬼》《麒麟送子》。我一看这些画，就知道这家伙不怀好心。我把情况向大队党支部作了汇报。书记说：“阶级敌人画宣扬反动思想的画，这可不是件小事。咱们要揭穿他的鬼把戏，想办法加强咱农村的社会主义思想阵地。”于是，我便画了《丰收图》、《人民公社好》等作品贴在杨建章正对门的贫下中农的大门上。群众看了我的画以后都很称赞，认为我的画压倒了地主的画，给贫下中农争了气。
    毛主席告诉我们，文艺要为工农兵服务，为工农兵所利用。我画的题材全是村里的事。一九六三年党号召画家史时，我给老贫农夏采花画了一套家史。在展览会上，夏采花老大娘满脸泪水地给人们讲解她旧社会的讨饭生活，起了很大的教育作用。我村一小队有几个姑娘劳动很踏实，活干得麻利。我抽空画了张《穆桂英插秧图》，贴在黑板报上表扬她们。群众看后说：“这伙女娃子就是干得好，该表扬。”从此她们上工劳动就更加积极了。
    自从我搞业余美术创作以来，总是坚持一边劳动，一边创作；白天下地干活，晚上回家画画，从来也没有因画画误过工。前年我村举办雷锋事迹展览，要我脱离生产去画连环画。我想画画决不能影响生产，于是我每天起个大早下地干活，到地里多加把劲，一天的活多半天就干完了。干完活回来再画画，一直画到深夜。当时队长便要队上给我补工分。我说：“我是搞宣传来的，不是要工分来的。”被我拒绝了。我说：“咱画雷锋就得学习雷锋。画画也是革命。”
    在业余美术创作实践中，使我认识到：要把自己的创作真正地作为斗争的武器，自己必须做一个彻底的革命者。为促使自己革命化，我经常学习毛主席著作，牢记毛主席教导。我还在自己的书桌前面写了这样四句诗：毛主席著作是灯塔，为政治服务牢记下，打击敌人是武器，教育人民作用大。
