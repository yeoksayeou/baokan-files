    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the clarion call to battle. Although I am currently hospitalized due to illness, no disease can lock up my revolutionary heart that yearns for revolution. I will use the pen that the Party has given me to fiercely fire at the Lu Ping-led black gang elements of Peking University, expose their painted skin, and angrily accuse this gang of counter-revolutionary crimes.

    Peking University, Controlled by Lu Ping and Others, Consistently Emphasized Bourgeois Politics and Resisted Mao Zedong Thought
    I entered the Chinese Department of Peking University in 1962. In September of that year, I, a child from a poor peasant family in the mountains, entrusted by the poor and lower-middle peasants and with the revolutionary ideal of studying for communism, came to Peking University. When I came, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village and the teachers of my alma mater repeatedly told me: "When you are by Chairman Mao's side, study Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and learn to master the true skills of the poor and lower-middle peasants in holding power. You must never forget your roots just because you have gone to university."

    I kept the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly in my mind and came to the capital of the motherland with excitement. But I never expected that as soon as I entered Peking University, I was pushed into the pile of old papers by the black gang elements. At the welcome party for new students held by the Chinese Department, the bourgeois "professors" and "scholars" came out to welcome us. Standing on the podium during classes, many were bourgeois intellectuals, right-wing elements, and some messy characters. In unison, they recited "Confucius said" with relish, shamelessly touting the dead, warmly praising the cultural prosperity of Chinese feudal society, using the past to satirize the present, and spreading their poison; or openly praising Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, promoting Shao Quanlin's "theory of writing about middle characters", and bragging about the so-called "literature and art of the 1930s." They listed hundreds of ancient books as our compulsory reading materials. The heavy curriculum squeezed the students so they had no room for initiative development, while the study of Chairman Mao's works was excluded from all courses, at most only "reference materials" that could be read or not! Here, the black gang elements promoted all kinds of dirty things, but they did not promote Mao Zedong Thought.

    Everyone knows that our beloved leader Chairman Mao once worked at Peking University, and there is an exhibition room in the Peking University Red Building where Chairman Mao and Comrade Li Dazhao worked. The school leaders never mentioned these glorious records of the school's history, let alone organize us to visit. In Party history classes, the teacher did not talk about the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." During the school year exams, no matter how much you demanded progress politically, and no matter how hard you studied Chairman Mao's works, as long as you did not write your papers according to the words of the bourgeois "professors" and "authorities," you would at most get a "pass," and if you were not careful, you would even get a "two". They used such despicable methods to force students to run counter to Mao Zedong Thought. They attempted to build an invisible high wall around the Peking University campus to resist the spread of Mao Zedong Thought.

    This is the evil deed done by Peking University controlled by Lu Ping and others. What they emphasize is the politics of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. What they implement is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and what they implement is entirely the bourgeois counter-revolutionary education policy. What they force young students to take is a thorough revisionist road of "peaceful evolution."

    Peking University, controlled by Lu Ping and a handful of royalist派, is a big dye vat of bourgeois ideology.
    In the spring of 1964, when I looked back and examined my past study and life, I was frightened and broke out in a cold sweat. After only staying at Peking University for more than a year, I found that the distance between myself and the poor and lower-middle peasants had widened, and the petty-bourgeois sentiments on my body had become stronger. I realized with alarm that if this continued, I would not only fail to live up to the hopes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but also roll into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie.

    I can't help but warn myself: turn back quickly! I can't go on so muddle-headed anymore. I want to take the revolutionary road. The experiences of many workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively, published in the newspapers, pointed out a correct path for me: It is impossible to engage in revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, I decided to study Chairman Mao's books well and secretly resist the black gang elements' set.

    From then on, I still followed the classes as usual, but I often warned myself: I must not be led by the nose by bourgeois elements! During self-study time, I no longer went to drill into the pile of old papers, and I focused my interest on political study. I systematically studied Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," studied almost every important editorial of the "People's Daily" since 1963, and carefully read every article published by our Party and other Marxist-Leninist brother parties against revisionism. The more I learned, the brighter my heart became; the more I learned, the more I felt that the political atmosphere in Peking University was not right. It is full of fierce class struggle here. Peking University is a big dye vat of bourgeois ideology, and if you are not careful, it will dye you smelly and rot you. The fragrant wind of the bourgeoisie will blow some people with weak wills into a dizzy state until it blows you into the stinking mud pit of the bourgeoisie. In the graduates of the past few years, such examples have been common. I gradually realized that if this continues, it is very easy to degenerate into an unworthy descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I am the son of a poor peasant, I must find a way to return to the team, and I must not degenerate.

    Lu Ping's black gang opposes students taking the road of integrating with the workers and peasants.
    In March and April 1964, we went to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement for a period of time. Staying in the countryside for only forty days, I felt that the actual struggle knowledge I learned and the political progress I made was better than reading books in the Peking University library for several years. Living with the poor and lower-middle peasants is completely different from being on the Peking University campus. This made me further realize that Peking University is not a proletarian position, and it is impossible to cultivate people who are of one mind with the poor and lower-middle peasants in Peking University.

    Back at school, I couldn't stay any longer. In May, I wrote a letter to the school "Party Committee" with incomparable excitement, strongly requesting to take root in the countryside. Because the poor and lower-middle peasants there need me, and I need to go to the front line of the three major revolutionary movements to temper and transform myself. I want to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take the road of integrating with the workers and peasants, and cultivate myself into a strong successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    My actions were praised and supported by some teachers and students. However, the black gang elements headed by Lu Ping not only did not support me but instead falsely accused me of "not listening to the Party's words very well" and "showing the narrow-mindedness and short-sightedness of small producers."

    In December the year before last, when I participated in the socialist education movement in the suburbs of Beijing, I once again submitted an application to settle down in the countryside. My application was received with unparalleled warm welcome from the local poor and lower-middle peasants, and also received extremely warm support from the comrades and the Party organization of the socialist education work team. However, when the relevant comrades conveyed my request to the school, the Lu Ping black gang still ignored it on the grounds that "the Ministry of Higher Education and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee did not have this provision." They also both beat and pulled, saying, "The Party needs you to stay in school for further study so that you can take on more important work in the future," and "The Party's cultivation of a college student is not for him to be a farmer." How "sweet" they said, how "concerned" and "valued" they were of me! However, their set could not deceive people, it was clearly a big conspiracy. They opposed the students taking the broad road of integrating with the workers and peasants, and were bent on cultivating us into die-hard revisionist elements according to their standards, and serving their capitalist restoration conspiracy.

    Lu Ping's black gang frantically persecutes good students who demand progress politically
    In October 1964, the Lu Ping black gang could no longer stop us from going deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, we rushed to the front line of rural class struggle and participated in the great socialist education movement. In the movement, through eating, living, and working together, we established a deep class feeling with the poor and lower-middle peasants, received political training, and strengthened our class viewpoint. Through practice, we further realized the greatness, brilliance, and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. We admired and loved Mao Zedong Thought even more, and our eyes became brighter and brighter. We saw the problems in the school more and more clearly.

    At the same time as we went to the countryside, Peking University also launched a socialist education movement. At the beginning of the movement, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students rose up to expose a large number of anti-Party crimes of the black gang elements such as Lu Ping, and the revolutionary righteousness was greatly enhanced. However, Lu Ping and his followers tried every means to sabotage the movement. They strictly blocked all news of the school's socialist education movement and forbade the teachers and students in the countryside to interfere with the movement in the school.

    At the end of January 1965, we returned to school for vacation. I was encouraged by the vigorous socialist education movement in the school at that time, and with incomparable excitement, I wrote a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, requesting to participate in the movement in the school. I wrote in the letter: When the leaders of our school are no longer revolutionary, we cannot but rise up to make revolution. We must rise up to thoroughly overthrow the power-holders who take the capitalist road. In view of the fact that most of the liberal arts teachers and students were in the countryside participating in the socialist education movement at that time, and the movement in the school urgently needed to fully mobilize the masses and fully mobilize the "insiders" in the countryside, I suggested to the Party, without affecting the socialist education movement in the countryside: In order to do a good job in the movement in the school and lay a good foundation for the thorough transformation of Peking University, transfer back the teachers and students participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, first do a good job in the movement in the school, and then go to the countryside.

    In order to express my infinite love and trust in the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, I attached my two diaries (the diary recorded my thoughts in 1964 and my views on some issues) to the letter and personally delivered them to Zhongnanhai on the afternoon of February 8.

    Before writing that letter, I repeatedly studied the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China." In contrast to the Party Constitution, I felt that what I did was correct. They knew that I had written a letter to the Central Committee, and they added all kinds of charges to me, pressing me down with all kinds of big hats so that I couldn't lift my head, and then they turned around and said that I was "alienated from the Party organization" and "did not listen to the organization's words."

    In this way, I became a thorn in the side of Lu Ping and his followers. After the expiration of the probationary period of my probationary Party membership, they created various excuses, did not listen to my defense, and refused to discuss my transfer to full membership.

    I, the son of a poor peasant born in a remote mountain village, suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me from the fire pit. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who gave me the opportunity to go to school and study, and cultivated me from an ignorant mountain village child into a college student with a certain socialist consciousness. The Party cultivated me to join the team, the League, and the Party. Everything I have belongs to the Party. I regard the Party and Chairman Mao as my reborn parents. I infinitely love and support our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and I am determined to follow the Party and Chairman Mao to make revolution for life, and I will never change my mind. I never expected that the black gang elements headed by Lu Ping would dare to be so rampant as to not allow me to take the revolutionary road and not let me follow the Party and Chairman Mao forward! Looking back, my past awareness was too low, my class viewpoint was too vague, I did not promptly see through the conspiracy of the black gang elements, and I did not carry out a forceful struggle with this gang of bad guys, and I failed to live up to the Party's many years of education and cultivation of me.

    In Peking University under the control of Lu Ping and others, there are countless politically progressive students, teachers, and staff who have been so mercilessly persecuted like me!

    The great combat call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao cleared away the layers of fog and exposed the painted skin of the Lu Ping black gang. The revolutionary leftists stood up, and the black gang elements such as Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun were driven off the stage. We want to solemnly tell the Lu Ping black gang, and solemnly tell all the big and small monsters and ghosts and snakes, your death knell has sounded, your doomsday has arrived, and your ugly faces have been exposed in broad daylight. You gang of clowns are trying to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, this is really like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, an ant trying to shake a tree, daydreaming. The wheels of history are rolling forward with the force of thunder, and will surely crush you to pieces!

    控诉陆平黑帮坚持修正主义教育路线的反革命罪行
    北京大学中文系贫农家庭出身的学生　高运安
    无产阶级文化大革命吹响了战斗的冲锋号。我目前虽然因病住在医院里，但是病魔怎么也锁不住我这颗要求革命的心，我要用党交给我的这枝笔，猛烈地向以陆平为首的北京大学黑帮分子开火，戳穿他们的画皮，愤怒控诉这伙黑帮的反革命罪行。
    被陆平等把持的北大，一贯突出资产阶级政治，抵制毛泽东思想
    我是一九六二年考入北大中文系的。那年九月，我这个出身于山区一个贫农家庭的孩子，受贫下中农的委托，怀着为共产主义而学习的革命理想，来到了北京大学。我来的时候，村里的贫下中农和我母校的老师一再嘱咐我：“到了毛主席身边要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，学习掌握贫下中农印把子的真本领，决不可以上了大学就忘了根本。”
    我牢牢记着贫下中农的话，兴冲冲地来到了祖国的首都。可万万没有想到，我一进北大，就被黑帮分子推进了故纸堆。在中文系举行的欢迎新生的晚会上，出来捧场欢迎我们的，是资产阶级的“教授”、“学者”。上课时在讲台上站着的，有不少人是资产阶级知识分子、右派分子和一些乌七八糟的人物。他们在课堂上异口同声、津津有味地背诵着“子曰诗云”，无耻地吹捧死人，热烈地歌颂中国封建社会的文化繁荣，借古讽今，大放其毒；或者公开吹捧田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙，宣扬邵荃麟的“写中间人物论”，吹嘘所谓“三十年代的文艺”。他们把上百部古书列为我们的必读书目，繁重的课程挤得学生毫无主动发展的余地，而毛主席著作的学习却被排斥在一切课程之外，至多也不过是可看可不看的“参考资料”而已！在这里，黑帮分子什么五花八门的肮脏东西都宣传，唯独不宣传毛泽东思想。
    谁都知道，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席曾经在北大工作过，在北大红楼里有毛主席和李大钊同志工作过的陈列室。对于学校历史的这些光荣记录，学校领导从来没有提到过，更不组织我们去参观。在党史课上，老师不讲《毛泽东选集》。学年考试时，不管你政治上多么要求进步，也不管你毛主席著作学习多么用功，只要你不按照资产阶级“教授”、“权威”们的话去写卷子，你顶多得个“及格”，弄不好甚至还要得“两分”。他们用这种恶劣的手段，硬逼着学生跟毛泽东思想背道而驰。他们企图在北大校园的四周筑起一道无形的高墙，抵制毛泽东思想的传播。
    这就是陆平等人所把持的北京大学所干的罪恶勾当。他们突出的是封建阶级、资产阶级的政治。他们实行的是资产阶级专政，他们所贯彻的，完全是资产阶级的反革命教育方针。他们强迫青年学生所走的，是彻头彻尾的修正主义“和平演变”的道路。
    陆平等一小撮保皇派所把持的北大，是资产阶级思想的大染缸
    一九六四年春天，当我回过头检查过去的学习和生活时，我吓得出了一身冷汗，在北大仅仅呆了一年多，我发现自己跟贫下中农的距离远了，我身上的小资产阶级情调浓了。我警觉到，这样下去，我不但要辜负贫下中农的希望，而且会滚进资产阶级的泥坑中去。
    我不能不警告自己：赶紧回头！我不能再那样糊里糊涂地走下去了。我要走革命的路。报纸上发表的许多工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的经验，都给我指出了一条正确的路：干革命不学毛主席著作不行。因此，我下决心好好读毛主席的书，暗中抵制黑帮分子的那一套。
    从那以后，我还照常跟着上课，但是我时常告诫自己：决不能让资产阶级分子牵着鼻子走！在自修时间里，我不再去钻故纸堆，我把自己的兴趣集中在政治学习上了。我比较系统地学习了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，几乎是逐篇地学习了《人民日报》一九六三年以来的重要社论，认真地阅读我们党和其他马列主义兄弟党发表的每一篇反对修正主义的文章。越学，我心里越亮堂；越学，我越感到北大的政治空气不对头。这里充满着激烈的阶级斗争。北大是一个资产阶级思想的大染缸，稍不警惕，它就会把你染臭，沤烂。资产阶级的香风，会把一些意志薄弱的人吹得晕头转向，直到把你吹进资产阶级的臭泥坑。在前几年的毕业生中，这样的例子已经屡见不鲜了。我渐渐认识到，长此下去，极容易堕落成贫下中农的不肖子孙。我是贫农的儿子，我必须想法归队，绝不可以堕落下去。
    陆平黑帮反对学生走与工农群众相结合的道路
    一九六四年三四月间，我们到农村参加了一段时间的社会主义教育运动。在农村里仅仅呆了四十天，可我觉得自己所学到的实际斗争知识，自己在政治上的长进，胜过在北大图书馆里读几年书。跟贫下中农在一起生活，和在北大校园里完全不一样。这使我进一步认识到，北大不是无产阶级的阵地，在北大培养不出跟贫下中农一个心眼的人来。
    回到学校，我再也呆不下去了。五月，我怀着无比激动的心情写信给学校“党委”，强烈要求到农村去扎根。因为那里的贫下中农需要我，而我又需要到三大革命运动的第一线上去锻炼和改造自己。我要按照毛主席的教导，走与工农群众相结合的道路，把自己培养成一个坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    我的举动，得到了一些老师和同学的赞扬和支持。然而，以陆平为首的黑帮分子不但不支持我，却反诬我“没有很好地听党的话”，是“小生产者心胸狭窄和目光短浅的表现”。
    前年十二月，我在北京郊区参加社会主义教育运动时，又一次提出到农村去安家落户的申请。我的申请受到了当地贫下中农无比热情的欢迎，也得到了同志们和社会主义教育工作团党组织的极其热情的支持。但有关同志向学校转达我的要求时，陆平黑帮仍然借口“高教部和北京市委没有此项规定”，不予理会。他们还又打又拉，说什么“党需要你留在学校里继续深造，以便将来担任更重要的工作”，说什么“党培养一个大学生不是为了让他当农民”。他们说的多“甜蜜”呀，他们对我是多“关心”、多“器重”呀！但是，他们这一套骗不了人，这分明是一个大阴谋。他们反对同学们走与工农群众相结合的广阔道路，一心要按照他们的标本，把我们培养成死心塌地的修正主义分子，为他们的资本主义复辟阴谋效犬马之劳。
    陆平黑帮疯狂地迫害政治上要求进步的好学生
    一九六四年十月，陆平黑帮再也无法阻止我们深入到贫下中农中去了。我们根据中共中央和国务院的指示，奔赴了农村阶级斗争的第一线，参加了伟大的社会主义教育运动。在运动中，我们通过同吃、同住、同劳动，跟贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情，在政治上受到了锻炼，加强了阶级观点。通过实践，我们更加认识了毛泽东思想的伟大、英明和正确，我们对毛泽东思想更加崇拜，更加热爱，我们的眼睛越来越亮，对于学校里的问题看得越来越清楚了。
    就在我们到农村去的同时，北大也展开了社会主义教育运动。运动开始，广大革命师生起来揭发了陆平等黑帮分子的大量反党罪行，革命正气大振。但是，陆平及其追随者千方百计地破坏运动。他们严密封锁学校社会主义教育运动的一切消息，不准我们在农村的师生过问学校里的运动。
    一九六五年一月底，我们返校休假。我为当时学校里轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动所鼓舞，怀着无比激动的心情写信给党中央和毛主席，请求参加学校里的运动。我在信中写道：当我们学校的领导不革命了的时候，我们不能不起来革命。我们一定要起来彻底搞垮走资本主义道路的当权派。鉴于当时大部分文科师生都在农村参加社会主义教育运动，学校里的运动又迫切需要充分发动群众，充分发动在农村里的“知情人”。在不影响农村社会主义教育运动的前提下，我向党建议：为了搞好学校里的运动，为彻底改造北大打下一个良好的基础，调回在农村参加社会主义教育运动的师生，先把学校里的运动搞好，然后再到农村中去。
    为了表示我对党中央和毛主席的无限热爱与信赖，我把自己的两本日记（日记上记着我一九六四年的思想情况和我对一些问题的看法）附在信中，在二月八日下午亲自送到了中南海。
    在写那封信以前，我反复学习了《中国共产党章程》。对照党章，我觉得自己这样做是正确的。他们知道我给中央写了信，更给我加了种种罪名，用各种大帽子压得我抬不起头来，接着又倒打一耙，说我跟党组织“离心离德”，“不听组织的话”。
    就这样，我成了陆平及其追随者的眼中钉。在我预备党员的预备期期满以后，他们制造种种借口，不听我的申辩，拒不讨论我的转正问题。
    我这个出生于偏僻山村的贫农的儿子，在旧社会受尽了苦，是党和毛主席把我从火坑里救了出来，是党和毛主席给了我上学念书的机会，把我从一个不懂事的山村野孩子，培养成为一个有一定社会主义觉悟的大学生，党培养我入了队、入了团、入了党。我的一切都是属于党的。我把党和毛主席当作是自己的再生父母，我无限热爱和拥护我们的党中央和毛主席，决心一生一世跟着党和毛主席干革命，海枯石烂不更心。我万万没有想到，以陆平为首的黑帮分子，竟敢如此猖狂地不准我走革命的路，不让我跟着党和毛主席前进！回想起来，我过去的觉悟太低了，阶级观点太模糊了，没有及时识破黑帮分子的阴谋诡计，没有跟这伙坏蛋进行有力的斗争，辜负了党对我的多年教育和培养。
    象我这样遭到无情迫害的政治上要求进步的学生和教师员工，在陆平等把持下的北大，真是数不胜数！
    党中央和毛主席的伟大战斗号召，拨开了层层迷雾，揭破了陆平黑帮的画皮。革命的左派站起来了，陆平、彭珮云等黑帮分子被赶下了台。我们要正告陆平黑帮，正告一切大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，你们的丧钟响了，你们的末日到了，你们的丑恶面目已经暴露在光天化日之下。你们这伙跳梁小丑们，妄图反对毛泽东思想，这真是螳臂当车，蚍蜉撼树，白日做梦。历史的车轮正以雷霆万钧之势滚滚向前，定将把你们碾得粉碎！
