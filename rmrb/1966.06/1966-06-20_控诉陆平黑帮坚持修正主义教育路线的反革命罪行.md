    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the clarion call to battle. Although I am currently hospitalized due to illness, no disease can lock up my revolutionary heart that yearns for revolution. I will use the pen that the Party has given me to fiercely fire at the Lu Ping-led black gang elements of Peking University, expose their painted skin, and angrily accuse this gang of counter-revolutionary crimes.

    Peking University, Controlled by Lu Ping and Others, Consistently Emphasized Bourgeois Politics and Resisted Mao Zedong Thought
    I entered the Chinese Department of Peking University in 1962. In September of that year, I, a child from a poor peasant family in the mountains, entrusted by the poor and lower-middle peasants and with the revolutionary ideal of studying for communism, came to Peking University. When I came, the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village and the teachers of my alma mater repeatedly told me: "When you are by Chairman Mao's side, study Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and learn to master the true skills of the poor and lower-middle peasants in holding power. You must never forget your roots just because you have gone to university."

    I kept the words of the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly in my mind and came to the capital of the motherland with excitement. But I never expected that as soon as I entered Peking University, I was pushed into the pile of old papers by the black gang elements. At the welcome party for new students held by the Chinese Department, the bourgeois "professors" and "scholars" came out to welcome us. Standing on the podium during classes, many were bourgeois intellectuals, right-wing elements, and some messy characters. In unison, they recited "Confucius said" with relish, shamelessly touting the dead, warmly praising the cultural prosperity of Chinese feudal society, using the past to satirize the present, and spreading their poison; or openly praising Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Hansheng, promoting Shao Quanlin's "theory of writing about middle characters", and bragging about the so-called "literature and art of the 1930s." They listed hundreds of ancient books as our compulsory reading materials. The heavy curriculum squeezed the students so they had no room for initiative development, while the study of Chairman Mao's works was excluded from all courses, at most only "reference materials" that could be read or not! Here, the black gang elements promoted all kinds of dirty things, but they did not promote Mao Zedong Thought.

    Everyone knows that our beloved leader Chairman Mao once worked at Peking University, and there is an exhibition room in the Peking University Red Building where Chairman Mao and Comrade Li Dazhao worked. The school leaders never mentioned these glorious records of the school's history, let alone organize us to visit. In Party history classes, the teacher did not talk about the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." During the school year exams, no matter how much you demanded progress politically, and no matter how hard you studied Chairman Mao's works, as long as you did not write your papers according to the words of the bourgeois "professors" and "authorities," you would at most get a "pass," and if you were not careful, you would even get a "two". They used such despicable methods to force students to run counter to Mao Zedong Thought. They attempted to build an invisible high wall around the Peking University campus to resist the spread of Mao Zedong Thought.

    This is the evil deed done by Peking University controlled by Lu Ping and others. What they emphasize is the politics of the feudal class and the bourgeoisie. What they implement is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and what they implement is entirely the bourgeois counter-revolutionary education policy. What they force young students to take is a thorough revisionist road of "peaceful evolution."

    Peking University, controlled by Lu Ping and a handful of royalistæ´¾, is a big dye vat of bourgeois ideology.
    In the spring of 1964, when I looked back and examined my past study and life, I was frightened and broke out in a cold sweat. After only staying at Peking University for more than a year, I found that the distance between myself and the poor and lower-middle peasants had widened, and the petty-bourgeois sentiments on my body had become stronger. I realized with alarm that if this continued, I would not only fail to live up to the hopes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, but also roll into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie.

    I can't help but warn myself: turn back quickly! I can't go on so muddle-headed anymore. I want to take the revolutionary road. The experiences of many workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively, published in the newspapers, pointed out a correct path for me: It is impossible to engage in revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, I decided to study Chairman Mao's books well and secretly resist the black gang elements' set.

    From then on, I still followed the classes as usual, but I often warned myself: I must not be led by the nose by bourgeois elements! During self-study time, I no longer went to drill into the pile of old papers, and I focused my interest on political study. I systematically studied Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," studied almost every important editorial of the "People's Daily" since 1963, and carefully read every article published by our Party and other Marxist-Leninist brother parties against revisionism. The more I learned, the brighter my heart became; the more I learned, the more I felt that the political atmosphere in Peking University was not right. It is full of fierce class struggle here. Peking University is a big dye vat of bourgeois ideology, and if you are not careful, it will dye you smelly and rot you. The fragrant wind of the bourgeoisie will blow some people with weak wills into a dizzy state until it blows you into the stinking mud pit of the bourgeoisie. In the graduates of the past few years, such examples have been common. I gradually realized that if this continues, it is very easy to degenerate into an unworthy descendant of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I am the son of a poor peasant, I must find a way to return to the team, and I must not degenerate.

    Lu Ping's black gang opposes students taking the road of integrating with the workers and peasants.
    In March and April 1964, we went to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement for a period of time. Staying in the countryside for only forty days, I felt that the actual struggle knowledge I learned and the political progress I made was better than reading books in the Peking University library for several years. Living with the poor and lower-middle peasants is completely different from being on the Peking University campus. This made me further realize that Peking University is not a proletarian position, and it is impossible to cultivate people who are of one mind with the poor and lower-middle peasants in Peking University.

    Back at school, I couldn't stay any longer. In May, I wrote a letter to the school "Party Committee" with incomparable excitement, strongly requesting to take root in the countryside. Because the poor and lower-middle peasants there need me, and I need to go to the front line of the three major revolutionary movements to temper and transform myself. I want to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take the road of integrating with the workers and peasants, and cultivate myself into a strong successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    My actions were praised and supported by some teachers and students. However, the black gang elements headed by Lu Ping not only did not support me but instead falsely accused me of "not listening to the Party's words very well" and "showing the narrow-mindedness and short-sightedness of small producers."

    In December the year before last, when I participated in the socialist education movement in the suburbs of Beijing, I once again submitted an application to settle down in the countryside. My application was received with unparalleled warm welcome from the local poor and lower-middle peasants, and also received extremely warm support from the comrades and the Party organization of the socialist education work team. However, when the relevant comrades conveyed my request to the school, the Lu Ping black gang still ignored it on the grounds that "the Ministry of Higher Education and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee did not have this provision." They also both beat and pulled, saying, "The Party needs you to stay in school for further study so that you can take on more important work in the future," and "The Party's cultivation of a college student is not for him to be a farmer." How "sweet" they said, how "concerned" and "valued" they were of me! However, their set could not deceive people, it was clearly a big conspiracy. They opposed the students taking the broad road of integrating with the workers and peasants, and were bent on cultivating us into die-hard revisionist elements according to their standards, and serving their capitalist restoration conspiracy.

    Lu Ping's black gang frantically persecutes good students who demand progress politically
    In October 1964, the Lu Ping black gang could no longer stop us from going deep into the poor and lower-middle peasants. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, we rushed to the front line of rural class struggle and participated in the great socialist education movement. In the movement, through eating, living, and working together, we established a deep class feeling with the poor and lower-middle peasants, received political training, and strengthened our class viewpoint. Through practice, we further realized the greatness, brilliance, and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. We admired and loved Mao Zedong Thought even more, and our eyes became brighter and brighter. We saw the problems in the school more and more clearly.

    At the same time as we went to the countryside, Peking University also launched a socialist education movement. At the beginning of the movement, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students rose up to expose a large number of anti-Party crimes of the black gang elements such as Lu Ping, and the revolutionary righteousness was greatly enhanced. However, Lu Ping and his followers tried every means to sabotage the movement. They strictly blocked all news of the school's socialist education movement and forbade the teachers and students in the countryside to interfere with the movement in the school.

    At the end of January 1965, we returned to school for vacation. I was encouraged by the vigorous socialist education movement in the school at that time, and with incomparable excitement, I wrote a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, requesting to participate in the movement in the school. I wrote in the letter: When the leaders of our school are no longer revolutionary, we cannot but rise up to make revolution. We must rise up to thoroughly overthrow the power-holders who take the capitalist road. In view of the fact that most of the liberal arts teachers and students were in the countryside participating in the socialist education movement at that time, and the movement in the school urgently needed to fully mobilize the masses and fully mobilize the "insiders" in the countryside, I suggested to the Party, without affecting the socialist education movement in the countryside: In order to do a good job in the movement in the school and lay a good foundation for the thorough transformation of Peking University, transfer back the teachers and students participating in the socialist education movement in the countryside, first do a good job in the movement in the school, and then go to the countryside.

    In order to express my infinite love and trust in the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, I attached my two diaries (the diary recorded my thoughts in 1964 and my views on some issues) to the letter and personally delivered them to Zhongnanhai on the afternoon of February 8.

    Before writing that letter, I repeatedly studied the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China." In contrast to the Party Constitution, I felt that what I did was correct. They knew that I had written a letter to the Central Committee, and they added all kinds of charges to me, pressing me down with all kinds of big hats so that I couldn't lift my head, and then they turned around and said that I was "alienated from the Party organization" and "did not listen to the organization's words."

    In this way, I became a thorn in the side of Lu Ping and his followers. After the expiration of the probationary period of my probationary Party membership, they created various excuses, did not listen to my defense, and refused to discuss my transfer to full membership.

    I, the son of a poor peasant born in a remote mountain village, suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved me from the fire pit. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who gave me the opportunity to go to school and study, and cultivated me from an ignorant mountain village child into a college student with a certain socialist consciousness. The Party cultivated me to join the team, the League, and the Party. Everything I have belongs to the Party. I regard the Party and Chairman Mao as my reborn parents. I infinitely love and support our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and I am determined to follow the Party and Chairman Mao to make revolution for life, and I will never change my mind. I never expected that the black gang elements headed by Lu Ping would dare to be so rampant as to not allow me to take the revolutionary road and not let me follow the Party and Chairman Mao forward! Looking back, my past awareness was too low, my class viewpoint was too vague, I did not promptly see through the conspiracy of the black gang elements, and I did not carry out a forceful struggle with this gang of bad guys, and I failed to live up to the Party's many years of education and cultivation of me.

    In Peking University under the control of Lu Ping and others, there are countless politically progressive students, teachers, and staff who have been so mercilessly persecuted like me!

    The great combat call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao cleared away the layers of fog and exposed the painted skin of the Lu Ping black gang. The revolutionary leftists stood up, and the black gang elements such as Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun were driven off the stage. We want to solemnly tell the Lu Ping black gang, and solemnly tell all the big and small monsters and ghosts and snakes, your death knell has sounded, your doomsday has arrived, and your ugly faces have been exposed in broad daylight. You gang of clowns are trying to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, this is really like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, an ant trying to shake a tree, daydreaming. The wheels of history are rolling forward with the force of thunder, and will surely crush you to pieces!
