    The Song of Ouyang Hai

    (Continued from yesterday)
    4. "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals"

    In the winter of 1949, blizzards swept over Laoyawo. The heaviest snow in a decade fell more than a foot thick, bending the pine trees and causing the thatched roofs to creak. People hoped: God, it's time for the sun to shine!

    Song Ya'zi returned, having deserted and worked as a farmhand in other villages for several years, begging for food all the way back. Though not yet thirty, his hair was already speckled with white. Since returning home in the middle of the night, the whole family was both happy and fearful. His father kept him locked in the house all day, afraid that the head of the village would come to arrest him as a "deserter."

    For more than a month, there had been talk that the Communists were about to enter the mountains. These days, the adults were discussing it everywhere in hushed voices. Little Hai wanted to join in and find out, but his father would always glare at him: "Little kid, go away, you don't understand anything!" The more they talked behind Little Hai's back, the more he wanted to know: What is the Communist Party? Is it people, or something else? He didn't understand.

    A gong sounded at the entrance to the mountain pass. Chief Pan, with six or seven guards, suddenly arrived at Laoyawo, declaring a state of "emergency alert," and saying that the Communists had entered the mountains, so he, the chief, was going to search every household. Two guards, each carrying a "Hanyang Rifle," barged into Little Hai's house. Little Hai was curious: Do we have "Communists" in our house too? He followed the guards, widening his eyes to see what was happening. The guards searched through boxes and cabinets, but seeing only rags and tatters, they deliberately smashed two earthenware bowls and left.

    Two furious roars came from the shed where firewood was piled: "Don't move, move and I'll shoot you!" His older brother was dragged from the haystack, his hands tied behind his back, to the threshing ground. Little Hai rushed out to see that more than a dozen young men were also tied up on the field. The chief waved his swagger stick: "Take them away!" A long rope bound a string of peasants, pulling and dragging them down the mountain.

    Laoyawo was like a pot that had boiled over, filled with cries and screams, mothers calling for their sons, people crying out to heaven, a scene of chaos. People followed their captured relatives, staggering down the mountain.

    As Little Hai followed his father down the mountain, he wondered: Aren't they searching for Communists, then why are they arresting my brother? He was even more confused.

    The courtyard of the Liu family mansion in Lianxi Town was crammed with a hundred or so young people who had just been seized from the surrounding villages, still bound, their ropes untied, all squatting in the yard, whispering and discussing something. Liu Dadou appeared on the steps, accompanied by two guards. He wore a Kuomintang army jacket, and coughed impressively. The crowd immediately quieted down.

    "Fellow villagers," Liu Dadou began, his eyes bloodshot. "Today, I've invited you brothers here to tell you something. Everyone's been talking about the Communists these days. That's right," he raised his voice, "the Communists are heading this way. …"

    Whether in surprise or delight, the crowd erupted in a commotion.

    Liu Dadou coughed several times to calm the scene. He spoke at length, from "Communists killing and setting fires, communist wives" to "the Communists won't stay long, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be back soon…" Finally, he solemnly revealed his real intentions: "The higher-ups have instructed me, your brother, to organize a self-defense militia. As long as you brothers are willing to follow me, Liu, into the mountains and hide for three or five days, on the day we return victorious, I will reward you according to your merits and give you a few years of peace and prosperity. I, Liu, am a man of my word and will never break my promise."

    "What will we eat?" a bold voice asked.

    "We'll share the salt or go without together. I have arrangements in the mountains, and from today onwards, your rations will be taken care of by your brother here."

    "In the dead of winter, we can't leave!" someone murmured.

    "Don't worry about that. As for clothes, they will be distributed in a few days, brand new padded jackets inside and out. As for family matters, I will naturally take care of them for you, so everyone can rest assured. Okay, untie them! Those who want to come with me, please stand to the right."

    The ropes were untied, but people kept their heads down, and no one moved.

    Liu Dadou frowned: "I'm doing this for the good of you villagers. The Communists share one knife among seven families in the county town, you won't have a good life if they come." Seeing that no one was moving, he continued, "I'll make myself clear today, anyone who wants to go up the mountain, the old debts and new accounts owed to my Liu family, whether it's grain or cash, will be forgiven. From now on, we'll be square."

    Liu Dadou's move was like dropping a cup of water into a hot oil pan, and the crowd boiled again. But they looked at each other, and still no one wanted to move. A silly person ran to the right and stood there, but looking back and seeing that no one else had moved, he hurriedly ran back to the crowd.

    Chief Pan interjected:

    "Ouyang Song, you deserter, how dare you stand still? Come over here!"

    Song Ya'zi glared at him and didn't move.

    "Come over here! Your father owes Lord Liu more than a hundred dan of grain, how are you going to pay it back? You're refusing such a great advantage, are you looking for death!" Pan Baochang waved at the guards, "Tie him up and bring him over!"

    "Let him come over himself!" Liu Dadou said,

    "That five fen of land on the sunny slope will also be my gift to you, from the Liu family."

    Song Ya'zi sat on the ground, hugging his knees, refusing to move. Pan Baochang twisted his mouth, and several guards came over and dragged him over with kicks and punches.

    Seeing that everyone was reluctant to move, Liu Dadou was so angry that he gritted his teeth, but he forced himself to say:

    "… Alright, everyone can think it over some more. Next, we'll have Commander Wu give a speech."

    The door of the main hall opened. A short, stocky fat man with a face full of horizontal lines walked out. He wore a short leather coat open, with two Mauser pistols strapped tightly to his wide belt.

    "Wu Zai'zi!…" someone whispered sharply.

    People understood: they were trying to drag the villagers up the mountain to become bandits. Falling into the hands of this living devil, they were afraid they wouldn't get out alive! …

    Wu Zai'zi put his hands on his hips: "This commander will only say one thing: those who want to go, come with me up the mountain; those who don't want to, will be executed on the spot." He swept his eyes around the yard.

    People avoided his gaze, afraid to move and afraid not to move. …

    Outside the gate, people were crying in a pile, family members dragging their children and leading their daughters came to the gate of the Liu family mansion, standing densely packed along half the street. They wanted to see their loved ones, to find out: was this kidnapping, conscription, or simply grabbing young men?

    Wu Zai'zi and Liu Dadou whispered a few words, and Liu Dadou gave the order: "As long as they are men, regardless of age, let them in; women and children, not one is allowed in."

    The guards opened the gate, and people crowded in regardless of life or death. Ouyang Hengwen was pushed in by the crowd with great difficulty, and the gate was closed again. Little Hai was blocked outside, caught in a crowd of women crying their hearts out, screaming desperately: "Dad! Dad! … Big brother!…"

    The high red walls blocked Little Hai's cries, and the pair of stone lions were grinning with their mouths wide open, staring at him with bulging eyes.

    Little Hai circled around the outside of the yard. The brick wall, ten feet high, separated him from the inside, and screams were constantly coming from the yard. He thought hard, trying to think of a way to get in. There was a small tree near the wall in the back yard, "That's right, I can climb in by way of the tree. Let it get dark soon, my mother is waiting for me to bring back some news!" He picked up a few stones and put them in his pocket, preparing to deal with "Lai Xi," the yellow dog, complaining to himself,

    "Ah, it's a pity I didn't bring my firewood knife with me!"

    It was a while after dark, Little Hai, climbing the tree, jumped over the wall, following the base of the wall forward. Such a big yard, and he was entering it for the first time, where to go in the darkness? Where are Dad and Big Brother?

    Suddenly, there were footsteps behind him, and a beam of light from a flashlight slid past him. Little Hai stuck tightly to the base of the wall, barely daring to breathe. Two patrolling guards were talking near the wall not far behind him.

    "Did you hear: the Communists are the Red Army who started the riots back then, and they're coming here from the county town!"

    "I know."

    "If you want to slip away, do it early…" the voice was very low.

    The other one answered loudly: "What are you afraid of! They didn't come here back then, and it's not certain whether they'll come this time! Even if they really do come, the county town is a hundred miles away, enough for them to run for several days…"

    "You don't understand!" The other interrupted him, "I heard from the brothers who retreated that the Communists are all heavenly soldiers and generals…" The rest of the voice was too quiet to hear.

    "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals"! Little Hai understood, he remembered the stories the old people told in the past, "… Divine Walker, can travel eight hundred miles in one night," "Prince Nezha, stepping on two wheels of wind and fire." … The Communists must be like that. Even the guards are afraid, they must be very powerful. Ah! I don't know if they'll come to the mountains. "Communists, please come quickly!" … Thinking, he almost shouted out, and hurriedly covered his mouth.

    There was some movement in the distance. "Who's there?" the guard shouted, chasing after it with his gun. Little Hai took the opportunity to slip quickly to the front.

    The yard was brightly lit, with dozens of torches burning. Liu Dadou was already packed, and several farmhands were moving things out. Quite a few people were tied up under the steps, Little Hai, sticking behind a pillar, searched with his eyes, "Big Brother is also tied up in the pile of people!" He wanted to shout, but didn't dare to make a sound. "Where's Dad? Dad wouldn't…"

    A big hand grabbed the back of Little Hai's neck: "Where did you come in from?" Little Hai was lifted up by his whole body.

    "Throw him in the jail and be done with it!" a voice said.

    Before Little Hai could resist, he was thrown into a dark room, his eyes still seeing stars, unable to see anything.

    After a while, a low voice in the corner of the room asked:

    "Who's there?"

    "Dad!" Little Hai recognized his father's voice, and quickly crawled towards the corner of the room.

    "San San?!" Dad asked in surprise. He reached out his hands and groped around in the dark room.

    "It's me!" Little Hai said, "I was looking for you everywhere."

    Dad hugged Little Hai, both complaining and angry: "San San, what are you doing here? Ah! …"

    "Mom is worried at home, I wanted to bring back some news."

    "San San!" Hengwen shook his head and said, "You're like Dad, you've jumped into the fire pit yourself!"

    Little Hai learned from his father that the Communists were heading to the mountains, and Liu Dadou and Wu Zai'zi wanted to drag people out to become bandits. Now, going is a dead end; not going is also a dead end.

    "Dad, what kind of people are the Communists?"

    "The Communists, well, they're the Red Army, some poor people who fight the local tyrants. One year when the Red Army passed by the county town, people who heard them said that the Red Army had spears, long guns, broad swords, red flags, red tassels, and jujube-red horses, how majestic…"

    "Will they fight Liu Dadou?"

    "Yes."

    "Then there's nothing to be afraid of." Little Hai understood everything in his heart. "Dad, I just heard that the Communists are coming here from the county town."

    Dad sighed and said: "I'm afraid it'll be too late."

    Little Hai didn't dare to ask about the "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals," nor did he ask if the Communists really had "flying feet" and "wheels of wind and fire," he firmly believed in it. He hoped in his heart: "Communists, please step on your "wheels of wind and fire" and kill them quickly! Otherwise, we won't be able to wait."

    The Communist Party, the million-strong army led by Chairman Mao, didn't step on any "wheels of wind and fire," but wore straw sandals, braving the snow, rushing towards the Guiyang mountains, towards Laoyawo, towards Ouyang Hai.

    A guard reported to Wu Zai'zi that the Communist advance troops had already detoured from Shatang. This news was like a stick poking into a hornet's nest, causing a commotion.

    Wu Zai'zi's face with horizontal lines twitched: "Formidable!"

    Liu Dadou's eyes widened: "Commander Wu… Wu… Wu… I, we, we hurry, hurry up and go!"

    Wu Zai'zi said slowly: "It's too late! These poor bones can't be taken, too many people is inconvenient. It doesn't matter, we'll take the small road, I have people in the mountains."

    Gunshots were heard in the distance.

    Liu Dadou's face turned pale: "Commander, Commander, I, I, Liu… all, all, depend on you."

    Wu Zai'zi patted his chest: "With me, you're safe, don't worry, old brother!" He pointed to the young people in the yard, "First, drive them all into that row of outbuildings, can't let these poor ghosts know where we're going."

    While Liu Dadou was directing the guards to drive the tied-up peasants into the outbuildings, he shouted with all his might:

    "Listen to me! I, Liu, am leaving, and I'll leave a few words for everyone. The Communists won't stay long, in 1928 they only stayed in the county town for a few days, whoever dares to move my, Liu's, house, my, Liu's, land, whoever dares to inform the Communists, I will kill his entire family!" He gritted his teeth and said, "I, Liu, always keep my word, those who are not afraid of death, just try it!"

    Wu Zai'zi pushed him aside: "Why are you wasting your breath with them!" He shouted to the guards, "Burn it!"

    "You, you, you…" Liu Dadou was so anxious that his tongue seemed to be shortened, "I, I, Liu, have never treated you badly! I, I, will still come back when we return victorious!"

    Wu Zai'zi said calmly: "Manlu, out with the old, in with the new, is a row of outbuildings worth a few coins? We'll have them build it for you when we come back!" He lowered his voice, "Besides, we can't stay in the mountains without killing people to silence them!"

    Liu Dadou gritted his teeth and stomped his feet: "Alright! I'll do as you say. Burn it!"

    They packed up their valuables and had just slipped out of the back door of the Liu family mansion when a thick smoke rose from the yard. …

    At this moment,

    The "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals"—the Liberation Army, stepped through the snow and rushed over.

    A company commander shouted: "Second Platoon, save the people, put out the fire; First and Third Platoons, follow me to chase!"

    Cries, shouts, and fire-fighting sounds mixed together.

    The villagers locked in the house were choked by the smoke and couldn't shout, they only heard a roar, and the thick smoke turned into flames, burning up. Seeing the flames getting closer and closer, Ouyang Hengwen, at a loss, hugged Little Hai, tightly against the earthen wall. He remembered the scene nine years ago when he carried Little Hai to the Earth God Temple: "That hurdle was finally overcome. Maybe he didn't die in the snow, but today he's going to be buried in this fire…"

    Second Platoon leader Zhou Hushan led the soldiers of the Fourth Squad into the yard. His fierce eyes swept around, and he shouted at the fire: "Go!" While speaking, he quickly untied his ammunition belt, kicked his right leg, broke through the door, grabbed Little Hai, who was covered in smoke, with his arm, and jumped out, rolling on the spot with the child, and the fire on Little Hai's body was put out. Zhou Hushan rushed back into the fire. …

    When it was barely light, the fire was completely extinguished. Little Hai and his father were separated again, and he didn't see his older brother either. He sat on the threshold of the Liu family mansion, his mind a mess, unable to figure out what had happened. Who was it who carried me out? Who put out the fire? Did Liu Dadou run away? Where's Dad? Have the "Heavenly Soldiers and Generals" already attacked?

    A person walked out of the door, Little Hai greeted him:

    "Sorry to trouble you, old man, have you seen my dad?"

    That person laughed loudly: "Old man? Who…"

    Little Hai fixed his eyes and looked carefully, in the dim morning light, he discovered that standing in front of him was a soldier, he had never seen such a soldier. He instinctively turned and ran, but suddenly he stopped, turned back, and carefully looked at the soldier: two bright red flags on the collar, a five-pointed red star on the hat, and a long red silk tassel attached to the gun handle tucked at the waist. "Red flags, red tassels, jujube-red horses…" He remembered what Dad said, "Could it be that he is the 'Heavenly Soldier and General', the Communist!" Little Hai turned back and took a few steps forward.

    That person was still laughing.

    Little Hai mustered up his courage and asked: "You, are you the Red Army, are you a Communist?!"

    "Yes," that person came forward and grabbed Little Hai's hand, "My name is Zhou Hushan. I was sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    "You really can tell the future, you know we're in trouble?"

    "We can't tell the future. But Chairman Mao knows that the people of the Guiyang mountains are in trouble, and it was he who told us to hurry here."

    The Communist Party had really come to his side, Little Hai had thousands of words in his heart, but didn't know where to start. He wanted to ask, who put out the fire, he wanted to know who carried him out of the fire. Looking up at Zhou Hushan, he felt that all of this didn't need to be asked. He opened his arms and suddenly hugged Zhou Hushan, opened his mouth, his throat choked by something, he didn't say a word, but tears welled up in his eyes…

    Zhou Hushan hugged Little Hai tightly with both hands. Through Little Hai's tattered cotton clothes, he felt the child trembling all over, and quickly took off his cotton military coat and put it on Little Hai. The warmth from the cotton clothes immediately spread throughout Little Hai's body. He picked up Little Hai and asked:

    "Little brother, what's your name?" While speaking, he casually put Little Hai on the back of the snarling stone lion in front of the door.

    Little Hai rode high on the back of the stone lion, he wanted to answer "Ouyang Yurong," but the words stopped at his mouth. Looking at this "Communist" beside him, he felt that he had become bolder, he raised his eyebrows, and for the first time in his life, he answered loudly in front of others:

    "Ou—yang—Hai."

    He looked up, and a sun was rising from the eastern mountain; looking down, he had already ridden onto the back of the stone lion. He reached out and touched the ball in the lion's mouth, and then patted the lion's head hard.

    "Am I really riding on the back of the lion?" Little Hai wondered to himself. Just turned nine years old Ouyang Hai, he still didn't know that a earth-shattering change had arrived.

    The streets were crowded with people, Dad and Big Brother were also in the crowd. Little Hai rode on the back of the lion pointing to the rising sun, and shouted loudly:

    "Dad, Big Brother, look, the sky is clear!"

    The winter sunlight streamed down from the sky, filling the mountains, filling Laoyawo, and also shining on Ouyang Hai's body.

    The snow began to melt. Under the eaves and under the trees, snow water dripped. The sparkling water, bubbling, was flowing into the ground.

    The pine tree in front of the door straightened its back, standing tall in the sun, it was green, delicate, and it was growing taller! … [End] (with images)

    Second Platoon Leader Zhou Hushan grabbed Little Hai's hand and said: "My name is Zhou Hushan. I was sent by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    "Communists, please come quickly!" Little Hai thought, almost shouting.

    欧阳海之歌
    金敬迈
    （续昨）
    四、“天兵天将”
    一九四九年的冬天，暴风雪铺天盖地地扑向老鸦窝。十年不遇的大雪下了尺把厚，压得松树弯了腰，压得茅草屋顶吱吱作响，人们盼着：老天爷，该晴天了！
    嵩伢子回来了，是开了小差、又在外乡当了几年长工，一路上讨米回来的。不到三十的人，头上已经斑斑点点地出现了一些白发。从那天半夜里回到家后，全家又是喜又是怕，爹爹整天把他锁在屋里，害怕保长来抓“逃兵”。
    个把月前就听说共产党要开进山里来，这几天大人们到处在低声议论。小海想凑拢去打听打听，爹爹总要瞪他两眼：“小伢子走开，你懂么事！”越是背着小海谈，小海越想知道：共产党是什么呢？是人哪，还是别的么事，他不明白。
    山口子上响起了一阵锣声，潘保长带着六七个保丁突然来到老鸦窝，说是“紧急戒严”，还说共产党进了山，他保长要挨家挨户地搜查。两个保丁各端着一条“汉阳造”闯进了小海屋里。小海觉得奇怪：我们屋里也有“共产党”？他跟在保丁后边，瞪大了眼睛想看个究竟。保丁们翻箱倒柜地搜着，看见尽是些破衣烂衫，才故意踩破两个瓦钵子走了出去。
    堆柴草的棚子里传来两声狂吼：“不准动，动一动老子就枪毙你！”——大哥被他们从草堆里揪出来了，反剪着双手拖到打谷场上。小海赶出去一看，场上还捆着十几个年青人。保长一挥文明棍：“带走！”一根长绳捆着一串庄稼人，连拉带拖地扯下山去。
    老鸦窝象开了锅，一片哭叫声，叫儿喊娘的，呼天抢地的，乱成一片。人们跟着被抓走的亲人，踉踉跄跄地跑下山去。
    小海一边跟着爹爹往山下走，一边在想：不是搜共产党吗，怎么把哥哥抓走了呢？他心里更糊涂了。
    莲溪镇上的刘家大屋院子里，塞满了刚从四乡抓来的百十口子青年人，绑没松、绳没解，一个个蹲在院子里交头接耳地议论着什么。刘大斗出现在台阶上，身旁还跟着两个护兵。他披着一件国民党部队的军上衣，威风凛凛地咳嗽了一声，人群立刻静下来了。
    “乡亲们，”刘大斗开了腔，眼珠上布满了血丝，“今天，我把弟兄们请到这里来，是要告诉大家一个信。这些天人人都在谈共产党。不错，”他提高了嗓门，“共产党正往这边开过来了。……”
    不知是惊还是喜，人群里轰的一声又乱了。
    刘大斗紧忙咳嗽了几下才压住场。他滔滔不绝地从“共产党杀人放火，共产共妻”说到“共产党呆不长，蒋委员长很快就要回来”……最后，他一本正经地托出本意：“上峰指示兄弟我组织民团自救。只要弟兄们肯跟着我刘某人上山，躲过这三五天，班师之日，我论功行赏，好好让乡亲们过几年太平日子。刘某人说话算话，决不食言。”
    “我们吃么事？”有个大胆的问了一声。
    “有盐同咸，无盐同淡。在山上我早有安排，从今天起，各位的口粮就由兄弟我包下来。”
    “寒冬腊月的，我们走不了呵！”有人在小声嘀咕。
    “这不怕。衣服嘛，过几天就发，里外三新的棉袄，家里的事情，我自然会替各位办妥，大家只管放心。好，松绑！愿意跟我走的，请往右边站。”
    绳子解开了，可是人们都低着头，没有一个人动。
    刘大斗皱了皱眉头：“我这是为了乡亲们好，共产党在县城里是七家共一把菜刀，来了也没有你们的好日子过。”看看还是没有人动，他继续说，“兄弟我今天把话说明，哪个愿意上山，欠我刘家的旧债新账，不管是谷子还是现钱，一概不算。今后我们就两清了。”
    刘大斗的这一手，象往油锅里滴进一盏清水，人群里叽叽哇哇地又沸腾起来。可是你看看我，我看看你，还是没有人想动。有个人傻呵呵地跑到右边去站着，回头看看大家没动，又急忙跑回人群里来。
    潘保长在一边插话：
    “欧阳嵩，你这个逃兵，胆敢站着不动？过来！”
    嵩伢子横了他一眼，没有动。
    “过来！你爹欠下刘老爷一百几十石谷，你拿什么来还？这么大个便宜你不捡，你是找死呵！”潘保长对护兵一挥手，“把他捆过来！”
    “让他自己过来嘛！”刘大斗说，
    “坡上向阳的那五分地，也算我姓刘的赏给你了。”
    嵩伢子往地上一坐，双手抱住膝盖，死也不肯动。潘保长嘴一歪，几个护兵过来，连踢带打地把他押了过去。
    看着大家都不想动，刘大斗气得直咬牙，他强憋着火说：
    “……好吧，各位再盘算盘算。下边请吴司令给大家训话。”
    正厅的门打开了。一个满脸横肉、矮墩墩的胖子走了出来。他把短皮袄敞着，宽宽的腰带上紧贴着两把盒子。
    “吴崽子！……”有人低声地尖叫着。
    人们心里明白了：这是要拉乡亲们上山当土匪。落在这个活阎王手里，怕是活不出去罗！……
    吴崽子把腰一杈：“本司令只说一句：情愿走的，跟我上山；不想去的，就地正法。”他拿眼睛朝院子里扫了一周。
    人们都躲着他的目光，又不敢动，又不敢不动。……
    大门外边叽叽哇哇地哭成一堆，拖儿带女的亲人们来到刘家大屋门口，密密麻麻地站满了半条街。他们想来看看自己的骨肉，想打听打听：这回绑人，是拉伕，还是抓壮丁？
    吴崽子和刘大斗耳语了几句，刘大斗发令：“只要是男人，不管老少都放进来；妇道、细伢子，一个也不准进。”
    护兵把大门打开了，人们不顾死活地往里挤。欧阳恒文好不容易被人潮推了进来，大门又关死了。小海被拦在外边，夹在一群哭得死去活来的妇女中，没命地大叫着：“爹！爹！……大哥呀！……”
    红门高墙挡住了小海的叫声，那对石头狮子正咧着大嘴、鼓起眼睛瞪着他。
    小海在院子外边转了又转。丈把高的砖墙把他隔在外边，院里不时传来哭叫声。他苦思苦想，想不出个进去的办法。后院靠墙边有棵小树，“对，可以顺树爬进去。天快点黑吧，我妈等我讨个信回去哩！”他捡了几块石头揣在兜里，准备对付“来喜”那条黄狗，埋怨自己说，
    “唉，可惜柴刀没带在身上！”
    天黑了好一会儿了，小海攀着树跳进墙来，顺着墙根往前摸。这么大的院子，他又是头一回进来，黑漆漆的往哪儿摸呢？爹爹和大哥在哪里呢？
    突然，身后有脚步声，一条手电棒的光柱从身边滑了过去。小海死死贴在墙根下，连气也不敢大喘了。两个巡更的保丁就在他身后不远的墙边谈起话来。
    “你听说没有：共产党就是当年搞暴动的红军，正从县城往这里开过来了！”
    “知道。”
    “想溜就趁早呵……”声音很低。
    另一个大声地回答着：“怕什么！当年他们就没有到这里来过，这次来不来还不一定哩！就算他们真的要来，县城离这里百把多里地，够他们跑好几天的……”
    “你不知道呵！”另一个打断了他的话，“我听撤下来的弟兄说，共产党都是天兵天将……”下边的声音小得听不见了。
    “天兵天将”！小海明白了，他想起老人讲古时说的故事，“……神行太保，一夜能走八百里”，“哪吒太子，脚踏两只风火轮”。……共产党怕就是这样的人吧。连保丁都怕，一定很厉害。唉！也不晓得他们到不到山里来。“共产党呵，你快点来吧！”……想着想着，他差点喊出声来，急忙捂住嘴巴。
    远处有点什么动静。“哪个？”保丁吆喝着，端枪追过去了。小海乘机一溜烟似地来到前边。
    院里灯火通明，几十个火把亮着。刘大斗已经收拾停当，好几个长工正往外搬东西。台阶下捆着不少人，小海贴在一根柱子后边用目光搜寻着，“大哥也被捆在人堆里！”他想叫，又没敢出声。“爹在哪儿呢？爹爹该不会……”
    一只大手抓住了小海的后脊梁：“从哪儿进来的？”小海整个身子被提了起来。
    “塞到牢里去算啦！”一个声音说。
    小海还没来得及反抗，就被扔进一个黑古隆咚的房里，眼睛里还冒着金花，什么也看不见。
    停了一会，屋角上一个低低的声音在问：
    “哪个？”
    “爹！”小海听出是爹爹的声音，飞快地朝屋角爬过去。
    “三三？！”爹爹吃惊地问。他伸出双手在黑屋里乱摸着。
    “是我！”小海说，“我到处找你。”
    爹爹抱住了小海，又是埋怨又是气：“三三，你进来做么事呵？唉！……”
    “妈在屋里着急，我想来讨个信回去。”
    “三三哪！”恒文摇摇头说，“你跟爹一样，这是自己跳到火坑里来了！”
    小海从爹爹嘴里知道，共产党要往山里开来了，刘大斗和吴崽子想拉人出去当土匪。如今，去是一条死路；不去，也是死路一条了。
    “爹，共产党到底是些么事人？”
    “共产党嘛，就是红军，是些打土豪的穷人。有一年红军打县城路过，听见过他们的人说，红军都是梭镖长枪宽大刀，红旗红缨枣红马，好不威风呵……”
    “他们打刘大斗不？”
    “打。”
    “那就不怕了。”小海心里全明白了。“爹，刚刚我听说，共产党从县城往这里打过来了。”
    爹爹叹息着说：“怕只怕来不及罗。”
    小海没敢问“天兵天将”的事，也没问共产党是不是真有“飞毛腿”和“风火轮”，这一点，他深信不疑。他心里盼着：“共产党呵，你踏着‘风火轮’快点杀过来吧！要不，我们就等不及了。”
    共产党、毛主席领导的百万雄师，没有踏着什么“风火轮”，是穿着草鞋，迎着漫天风雪，朝桂阳山区、朝老鸦窝、朝着欧阳海飞奔而来。
    一个保丁给吴崽子报信说，共产党的先头部队已经从沙塘那边绕过来了。这个消息就象棍子捅进了马蜂窝，引起一阵骚乱。
    吴崽子脸上横肉一抖：“厉害！”
    刘大斗的眼睛睁得圆圆的：“吴……吴……吴司令，我，我们快，快走呀！”
    吴崽子慢吞吞地说：“来不及了！这些穷骨头没法带，人多不方便。没关系，我们绕小路走，山上有我的人。”
    远处传来几声枪响。
    刘大斗脸色煞白：“司令，司令，我刘刘，刘某人……全，全靠你了。”
    吴崽子拍了拍胸脯：“有我就有你，只管放心，老弟！”他指着院里的年轻人，“先把他们都赶进那排下房里去，不能让这些穷鬼晓得了我们的去向。”
    刘大斗一边支使护兵把捆着的庄稼汉往下房里赶，一边使出吃奶的劲喊着：
    “都听着！刘某人要走了，留几句话给大家。共产党是呆不长的，民国十七年他们在县城也只呆过几天，你们哪个敢动一动我刘老爷的房子、刘老爷的地，哪个敢替共产党通风报信，我杀他满门九族！”他咬牙切齿地说，“刘某人从来就说话算话，不怕死的，你们就试试看！”
    吴崽子把他推到一边：“你跟他们费什么口舌！”他对护兵喊，“给我烧！”
    “你，你，你……”刘大斗急得舌头象短了一截，“我刘某人可从来没有亏待过你呀！我，我班师之日还要回来的！”
    吴崽子心平气和地说：“满禄，旧的不去，新的不来，一排下房值得几个钱？回来的时候再叫他们给你砌！”他放低了声音，“再说，不杀人灭口，我们在山上也呆不住呵！”
    刘大斗又咬牙又跺脚：“好！我依你的。烧！”
    他们收拾好细软，刚刚从后门溜出了刘家大屋，一股浓烟就从院里冒了起来。……
    就在这个时候，
    “天兵天将”——解放大军踏着风雪冲过来了。
    一个连长高声喊着：“二排救人，救火；一、三排，跟我追！”
    哭声，喊声，救火声混成一片。
    关在屋里的乡亲们被浓烟呛得喊不出声来，只听轰的一下，浓烟变成了火苗，烧起来了。眼看火苗越逼越近，欧阳恒文手足无措地搂着小海，紧紧贴在土墙上。他想起了九年前自己抱着小海往土地庙走去的情景：“那一关总算闯过来了。未必雪里没死成，今天却要埋在这火堆里……”
    二排长周虎山带着四班的战士冲进院里。他虎彪彪的眼睛朝周围扫了一圈，冲着大火喊了一声：“上！”边说边飞快地解下子弹袋，飞起右腿，破门而入，用胳膊夹起浑身冒烟的小海，大步跳将出来，抱着孩子就地一滚，小海身上的火灭了。周虎山又冲进火海中。……
    天麻麻亮的时候，火全灭了。小海和爹爹又失散了，也没看见大哥。他坐在刘家大屋的门槛上，心里象一锅粥似的闹不清发生了什么事。是哪个把我抱出来的？是哪个救的火？刘大斗跑了没有？爹爹在哪里？是不是“天兵天将”已经打过来了？
    门里走出来一个人，小海迎了上去：
    “难为你，老人家，你看见我爹爹没有？”
    那个人哈哈大笑起来：“老人家？谁呀……”
    小海定神细看，晨光曦微中他发现站在面前的是一个兵，自己还从没见过这样的兵。他本能地撒腿就跑，忽然他又停下了脚，回头仔细地打量着这个兵：衣领上两面鲜艳的红旗，帽子上一颗五角红星，掖在腰间的枪把上，缀着一条长长的红绸子。“‘红旗红缨枣红马’……”他想起了爹爹说的话，“莫非他就是那个‘天兵天将’，是那个共产党吧！”小海回转身来，朝前挪了几步。
    那个人还在笑。
    小海鼓起勇气问道：“你，你是红军，是共产党吧？！”
    “是呵，”那个人走上前来，抓住了小海的手，“我叫周虎山。是共产党、毛主席派来的。”
    “你们真的能掐会算，晓得我们在遭难哪？”
    “我们不会掐也不会算。可是毛主席晓得桂阳山区的人民在遭难，是他老人家叫我们赶来的。”
    共产党真的来到了身边，小海心里千言万语不知从何说起。他想问，是谁救的火，他想知道是哪个把他从火里抱出来的。仰头看了看周虎山，觉得这一切都不用问了。他张开手臂猛地一下抱住了周虎山，张了张嘴，喉咙里象被什么东西哽住，话没说出口，眼泪却涌了出来……
    周虎山用两只大手紧紧搂着小海。透过小海又破又烂的棉衣，他感觉到怀里的孩子在浑身颤抖，急忙脱下自己的棉军衣，披在小海身上。棉衣上的热气立刻传遍小海全身。他把小海抱了起来，问道：
    “小兄弟，你叫什么名字？”说着，顺手把小海放到门前那只呲牙咧嘴的石狮子背上。
    小海高高地骑在石狮子背上，他想回答说“欧阳玉蓉”，话到口边又停住了。看了看身边的这个“共产党”，觉得自己胆大起来，他眉毛一扬，有生以来头一次当着别人响亮地回答道：
    “欧——阳——海。”
    他抬起头看，一轮太阳正从东山升起来；低头瞧，自己已经骑到石头狮子的背上来了。他伸手摸了摸狮子嘴里的圆球，又使劲地拍打着狮子的脑袋。
    “我真的骑到狮子背上来了吗？”小海心里在问着自己。他从狮子背上跳了下来，狮子还和从前一样：咧着大嘴，鼓起眼睛。小海一翻身又轻易地跨了上去。
    “这是真的……”小海骑在狮背上还在想。刚满九岁的欧阳海，他还不知道，一场天翻地覆的变化已经到来。
    街上行人熙熙攘攘，爹爹和大哥也夹在人群里边。小海骑在狮子背上指着东升的太阳，高声喊着：
    “爹，大哥，你们看，天晴了呵！”
    冬天的阳光从天上洒下来，它铺满了山区，铺满了老鸦窝，也照在欧阳海的身上。
    雪开始融化了。屋檐下、树下滴滴答答地掉着雪水。亮晶晶的水呵，正鼓着小泡往地里流去。
    门前的松树伸直了腰，挺立在阳光下，它碧绿，娇翠，它正在往上长哩！……　　　〔续完〕（附图片）

    二排长周虎山抓住小海的手说：“我叫周虎山。是共产党、毛主席派来的。”
    “共产党呵，你快点来吧！”小海想着想着，差点喊出声来。
