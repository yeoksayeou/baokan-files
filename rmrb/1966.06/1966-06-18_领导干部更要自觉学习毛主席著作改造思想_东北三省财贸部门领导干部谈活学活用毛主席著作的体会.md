    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th, how can leading cadres in the financial and trade departments take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way, and make great efforts in ideological revolutionization? This was discussed recently at a meeting of leading cadres from the financial and trade departments of the three provinces convened by the Financial and Trade Political Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that whether or not leading cadres in the financial and trade departments can study and apply Chairman Mao's writings well and carry out self-revolution and self-transformation is not merely a personal issue, but a major issue concerning whether a department or a region can hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and run the people's financial and trade well.
    At the meeting, many leading cadres from the financial and trade departments of the three provinces shared their experiences of how they progressed from unconsciously to consciously studying Chairman Mao's writings, and answered questions such as whether leading cadres in certain financial and trade departments can rely on their "old capital," whether they need to transform their thinking, and how to carry out self-revolution.
      Confront Shortcomings, Lay Down Burdens, and Continuously Revolutionize
    During the discussion, it was unanimously felt that the main ideological obstacles currently facing leading cadres in the financial and trade departments in the issue of ideological revolutionization are arrogance and complacency; carrying the burden of being "red veterans" and not daring to face shortcomings, lacking the determination and courage for self-revolution. Many veteran comrades who had participated in the revolution for many years said that old cadres must also continuously revolutionize and continuously transform themselves. Failure to acknowledge this point will inevitably lead to a relaxation of self-transformation, which will prevent any progress from being made.
    Xie Xuewu, Deputy Director of the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, said with deep feeling: "In the past, I always thought that I had been a Red Army soldier and had withstood the test of harsh environments, and that the issue of my worldview had already been resolved. Because I was carrying the burden of being an 'old revolutionary' and a 'red veteran,' I gradually relaxed my ideological transformation. As a result, in my work, I developed problems such as subjectivism, giving orders, and 'bureaucratic airs,' and my work became increasingly passive. When the whole country was learning from the People's Liberation Army, I felt a great gap when I compared myself with the People's Liberation Army. I reread Chairman Mao's articles such as 'Serve the People' and 'Lay Down the Burden and Start the Machine' with the problems in my thinking and work. Chairman Mao's words moved my heart deeply. After a period of study, I re-evaluated myself, found the root of the problem, and deeply realized that a true revolutionary can only uphold continuous revolution if they dare to face their shortcomings and dare to lay down their burdens." Liu Jie, Director of the Changchun City Tax Bureau of Jilin Province, said that in the past, he had mistakenly believed that relying on his "old capital" and old experience, and focusing on business, would certainly improve work. Now he realizes that objective things are constantly developing and changing, and it is no longer possible to rely on "old capital" to get by! We must start from scratch and continuously revolutionize.
      Put Down "Official" Airs, Dare to Reveal Thoughts
    Studying Chairman Mao's writings is a profound ideological revolution. For a leading cadre, whether or not they can put down their "official" airs, place themselves among the masses, strictly demand themselves, reveal their thoughts, and truly achieve "exposing thoughts without fear of ugliness, analyzing and criticizing without fear of pain" is the primary key to whether or not they can study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way to transform their thinking.
    Zhang Hanqing, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shenyang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Liaoning Province, said in introducing his experience that in order to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must sincerely transform oneself, and to transform oneself, one must achieve "three dares and three no fears": dare to put oneself in and reveal thoughts, without fear of ugliness; dare to fight with the word "I," without fear of pain; dare to correct mistakes, put them into action, without fear of hardship or difficulty. Zhang Hanqing said: "In 1964, I was transferred from a government agency to work in the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. When I first arrived, I had many ideas, such as thinking that the sign of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative was not as 'bright' as that of the government agency, emphasizing that I was unfamiliar with the business and that the work was not easy to do, and so on. Because many problems in my thinking were not resolved, many problems in the agency could not be resolved either. Later, a small rectification campaign using Mao Zedong Thought was carried out among the leading cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, I did not fully reveal my thoughts. Later, with this problem in mind, I read Chairman Mao's 'On Coalition Government.' According to Chairman Mao's teaching, '...Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not suit the needs of the people that you are reluctant to abandon?' At the rectification meeting, after I revealed my dirty thoughts, many comrades also put forward their own problems and studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way in connection with their thinking."
    Leading cadres should not participate in study as transformers, but should first transform their own thinking in order to educate others. Bian Yukun, Deputy Director of the Jilin Provincial Finance Committee and Director of the Finance Department, said that to study Chairman Mao's writings, one must first grasp oneself, grasp one's own living thoughts, and carry out self-transformation. It is impossible to lead the "team" well if one's own thinking is not transformed well. Many comrades have shared their experiences in this regard. The fundamental reason why some leading cadres study well and apply well is that they are determined to transform their own thinking and study Chairman Mao's writings with their own living thoughts.
  Learn in Practice, Apply in Practice, Learn While Applying, Apply While Learning
    Many comrades have said that to truly study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way, one must learn in practice, apply in practice, learn while applying, and apply while learning. "Learning and application" cannot be separated. One cannot shut oneself up and study mechanically, be high above, detached from reality, and detached from the masses.
    He Shoulun, Deputy Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, shared his experience of how he tasted the sweetness of learning in practice. He said: "In 1964, when solving the problem of phosphate fertilizer supply, some counties complained that the allocation was too small, while others were unwilling to accept it. I did not conduct any investigation or research, and subjectively believed that this was because the publicity work was not done well enough, so I decided to vigorously publicize the effectiveness of phosphate fertilizer. As a result, those who did not want it still did not want it, and they still returned the phosphate fertilizer. What was the problem? I studied Chairman Mao's writings with this problem in mind, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings, I went to representative counties to conduct practical investigations. The results of the investigation were: Zhaodong, Mishan, and other counties have more saline-alkali land, and applying phosphate fertilizer can loosen the soil, treat alkali, and significantly increase production; while the other counties do not have saline-alkali land, and the use of phosphate fertilizer is not effective. Once the actual situation was clarified, the problem was quickly and reasonably solved. Through this incident, I also dug out my own subjectivism and realized that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way in practice can I study and apply them well."
    Learning that is separated from practice is equivalent to learning without using, and cannot achieve the purpose of transforming oneself, transforming nature, and improving work. Jin Zhiguo, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Shenyang City Tax Bureau in Liaoning Province, said: "In the past, I squatted in the agency and studied 'On Contradiction' for several years, but I could not apply it to practice and could not grasp the main contradiction. Last June, I walked out of the office and squatted in the Tiexi District Tax Bureau. After going down, I implemented the 'three togethers' with the employees. Soon, I discovered that there was a tendency to emphasize business and neglect politics. How to solve this problem? With this problem in mind, I reread 'On Contradiction' and 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People' and other articles. According to Chairman Mao's teaching that 'external causes are the conditions for change, and internal causes are the basis for change,' I realized that to solve this problem, we must start by raising the ideological awareness of the employees. Therefore, I spent two months organizing leading cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works such as 'Serve the People,' 'Combat Liberalism,' and 'On Coalition Government,' as well as Comrade Liu Shaoqi's 'On the Self-Cultivation of Communists,' to encourage them to consciously revolutionize. Because we used Mao Zedong Thought to guide our work and solve problems, the work of this unit quickly took on a new look. Through this practice, we felt that only by studying and applying in a lively way in practice can we deepen our understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, and can we learn more and more 精, and can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought."
        Leading by Example Can Motivate the Masses
    For a leading cadre, how can one be a good "squad leader," lead a team well, and lead out a very proletarianized, very revolutionary team? Everyone unanimously felt that the key issue is whether the leading cadres can take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's writings well, emphasize politics, and use politics to command business. The learning of leading cadres, whether they can set an example by their own actions and make a good appearance, has a great influence on the masses. Zhang Hanqing said that in the past two years, he has increasingly felt that his own good or bad learning has a great impact on the learning of the masses. Last year, some of our cadres were unwilling to go to the countryside, and I myself spent very little time in the countryside, and even when I went down, I was just "going through the motions." I studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" again with this problem in mind, and compared myself while learning. I found that I still had the individualistic thoughts of fearing hardship and seeking comfort. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I took the lead in examining and criticizing my own selfish and miscellaneous thoughts at the cadre meeting. Then, I took my luggage and Chairman Mao's writings, walked out of the office, and went down to the rural grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives to squat. After doing this, some of our comrades in the agency also took their luggage and Chairman Mao's writings to squat down. In the countryside, they picked up the peddler's burden. Some comrades also studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way with the question of why they could not face the countryside, revealing their thoughts, digging out the roots, and consciously revolutionizing.
    The meeting emphasized that at present, the financial and trade departments of the three northeastern provinces are carrying out a major discussion on the relationship between politics and business. The key to whether it can be done well lies in raising the awareness of leading cadres, correcting their attitude, truly putting the study of Chairman Mao's writings at the top of all work, and first taking the lead in studying and applying them well.

    领导干部更要自觉学习毛主席著作改造思想
    东北三省财贸部门领导干部谈活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    据新华社沈阳十七日电　财贸部门领导干部怎样带头活学活用毛主席著作，在思想革命化上狠下功夫？最近，在中共中央东北局财贸政治部召开的三省财贸部门领导干部会议上进行了讨论。经过讨论，一致认为财贸部门领导干部能不能学好用好毛主席著作，进行自我革命，自我改造，不只是个人的问题，而是关系到一个部门、一个地区能不能高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，办好人民财贸的大问题。
    会上，三省财贸部门许多领导干部都谈了自己是怎样由不自觉到自觉地学习毛主席著作的体会，回答了某些财贸部门领导干部靠“老本”吃饭行不行、要不要改造思想以及怎样进行自我革命等问题。
      正视缺点，放下包袱，不断革命
    在讨论中一致感到，当前财贸部门领导干部在思想革命化问题上的主要思想障碍，是骄傲自满情绪；背上“老来红”的包袱，不敢正视缺点，缺乏自我革命的决心和勇气。不少参加革命多年的老同志都说，老干部同样要不断革命不断改造，不承认这一点，必然会放松自我改造，就不能有所前进。
    辽宁省供销社副主任谢学武深有所感地说：过去总认为自己当过红军，经受过艰苦环境的考验，世界观的问题已经解决了。由于背上“老革命”、“老来红”的包袱，对思想改造逐渐放松了。因而，在工作中就滋长了主观主义、指手划脚、“官气”等毛病，工作也越来越被动。当全国人民大学解放军的时候，自己同解放军一比，才感到差距太大了。我就带着自己思想和工作上的问题，重读了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章。毛主席的话，句句打动我的心。经过一段学习，我重新认识了自己，找到了问题的根子，深刻认识到一个真正的革命者只有勇于正视缺点，勇于放下包袱，才能坚持不断革命。吉林省长春市税务局长刘洁如说，过去一直错误地认为，靠“老本”，凭老经验，狠抓业务，工作一定能有起色。现在才体会到，客观事物在不断发展变化，再靠“老本”吃饭不行啦！必须从零开始，不断革命。
      放下“官”架子，敢于亮思想
    学习毛主席著作是一场深刻的思想革命。对一个领导干部来说，能不能放下“官”架子，把自己置身于群众之中，严格要求自己，把思想亮出来，真正做到“暴露思想不怕丑，分析批判不怕痛”，这是能否活学活用毛主席著作改造自己思想的首要关键。
    辽宁省沈阳市供销社党委书记张翰卿在介绍体会时谈到，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，就得真心诚意地改造自己，而改造自己就必须做到“三敢三不怕”：敢于把自己摆进去亮思想，不怕丑；敢于和“我”字斗，不怕痛；敢于改正错误，见诸行动，不怕苦不怕难。张翰卿说：一九六四年我从政府机关调到供销社工作，刚来时想法很多，如认为供销社的牌子没有政府机关“亮”，强调业务生疏工作不好做等等。由于思想上很多问题没解决，机关里的许多问题也没法解决。后来在供销社领导干部中用毛泽东思想进行了一次小整风，整风开始时还没有全部亮出自己的思想，后来带着这个问题读了毛主席的《论联合政府》。按照毛主席的“……难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”的教导，在整风会上我把自己的脏思想亮了出来以后，不少同志也都把自己的问题摆了出来，联系思想活学活用了毛主席著作。
    领导干部参加学习不能以改造者自居，为了教育别人，首先要改造自己的思想。吉林省财委副主任、财政厅长边裕鲲说，学习毛主席著作，首先要抓自己，抓自己的活思想，进行自我改造。自己思想改造不好，是不可能把“班子”带好的。许多同志都谈了自己这方面的体会。有些领导干部所以学得好，用得活，根本一条就是决心改造自己的思想，带着自己的活思想学习毛主席著作。
  实践中学，实践中用，在学中用，在用中学
    许多同志都谈到，要真正活学活用毛主席著作，必须在实践中学，在实践中用，学中用，用中学，“学用”不能分家。不能关起门来死读书，高高在上，脱离实际，脱离群众。
    黑龙江省供销社副主任何首伦谈了自己是怎样在实践中尝到了学习甜头的。他说：在一九六四年解决磷肥供应问题时，有的县嫌分配得少，有的县又不愿要。我没有去调查研究，主观地认为这是因为宣传工作做的不够，就决定大力宣传磷肥的效能。结果，不要的仍是不要，照样把磷肥退回来。问题到底在那呢？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，深入到有代表性的县去做实际调查。调查的结果是：肇东、密山等县盐碱地较多，上了磷肥能起到松土、治碱的作用，增产效果显著；而另外那几个县不是盐碱地，使用磷肥并不见效。实际情况弄清了，很快就合理地解决了这个问题。通过这一事件，也挖出了自己的主观主义，认识到只有在实践中活学活用毛主席著作，才能学好用好。
    学习离开实践，就等于学而不用，达不到改造自己、改造自然、改进工作的目的。辽宁省沈阳市税务局党委书记靳治国说：过去我蹲在机关学了几年《矛盾论》，就是运用不到实践中去，抓不住主要矛盾。去年六月间，我走出办公室，到铁西区税务局蹲点，下去后同职工们实行“三同”，不久就发现那里有重业务轻政治的偏向。怎样下手解决呢？带着这个问题，我重读了《矛盾论》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等文章。按照毛主席的“外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据”的教导，认识到解决这个问题，必须从提高职工们的思想觉悟入手。于是用两个月的时间，组织领导干部反复学习《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》、《论联合政府》等毛主席著作和刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》，启发他们自觉革命。由于运用了毛主席思想指导工作、解决问题，这个单位的工作很快出现了新局面。通过这次实践，我们感到只有在实践中活学活用，才能加深对毛主席思想的理解，才能越学越精，才能真正把毛主席思想学到手。
        身体力行才能带动群众
    对一个领导干部来说，怎样才能当好“班长”，带好一班人，带出一个非常无产阶级化，非常革命化的队伍来呢？大家一致感到，关键问题在于领导干部能不能带头学好毛主席著作，突出政治，以政治统帅业务。领导干部的学习，能不能以身作则，做出样子，对群众的影响是很大的。张翰卿说，近两年来，自己越来越感到自己学好学坏对群众学习有很大影响。去年我们有些干部不愿意下乡，我自己下乡的时间也很少，就是下去也是“走马观花”。我带着这个问题重新学了“老三篇”，边学边对照自己，发现自己还有怕艰苦、图安逸的个人主义思想作怪。根据毛主席的教导，我在干部会议上带头检查和批判了自己的私心杂念。然后，就带着行李，带着毛主席著作，走出办公室，下到农村基层供销社蹲点。这样做以后，我们机关的一些同志也带上行李，带着毛主席著作下去蹲点，在农村挑起了货郎担。也有一些同志带着为什么不能面向农村的问题活学活用毛主席著作，亮思想，挖根子，自觉革命。
    会议强调指出，目前东北三省财贸部门，正在开展政治和业务关系的大讨论，能否搞好的关键在于提高领导干部的认识，端正态度，真正把毛主席著作学习放在一切工作的首位，首先自己带头学好用好。
