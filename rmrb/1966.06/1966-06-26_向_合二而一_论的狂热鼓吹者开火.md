    Dividing one into two is the fundamental law of objective things, the proletarian worldview, an important component of Mao Zedong Thought, and a sharp weapon in the hands of revolutionary people. "Two combine into one" is a revisionist fallacy against dialectics. The anti-Party element Kuang Yaming is a fanatical believer and advocate of the reactionary "two combine into one" theory. In recent years, he has tirelessly promoted the "two combine into one" theory, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and sung a tune contrary to the Party.

    In 1964, when criticizing Yang Xianzhen's "two combine into one" theory, he talked extensively about identity in classrooms and reports. He said indignantly: "Don't be afraid to talk about 'unity' just because you are criticizing 'two combine into one'; 'unity' is the goal." Listen! How similar his words are to Yang Xianzhen's! Our criticism of "two combine into one" hit Yang Xianzhen, but the pain was felt by Kuang Yaming. Chairman Mao taught us: The bourgeoisie "must stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues in various ways. It is impossible for them not to reflect or express themselves." Kuang Yaming's reactionary class instinct made it imperative for him to jump out and defend Yang Xianzhen.

    The "two combine into one" theory is the philosophical basis of Kuang Yaming's reactionary views. He promoted the "two combine into one" theory in a series of other issues.

    When discussing the relationship between being "red" and "expert," Kuang Yaming repeatedly said: "Being red is manifested in being expert," and "The process of being expert is also the process of being red." Here, he categorically denied the contradiction and struggle between being "red" and "expert," and completely erased the commanding role of being "red." The "redness" that Kuang Yaming speaks of is merely a facade. In reality, he wants us to be only expert but not red, to take the path of being white and expert, and to become successors of the bourgeoisie.

    Kuang Yaming very much emphasized the need to improve "teacher-student relations" and "relations between young and old." He praised bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" to the skies, always referring to "so-and-so old" and "so-and-so gentleman." He wanted us to inherit their things first, and then criticize them later. He even said that in order to inherit their things, we could "serve them, empty their chamber pots, and hold their children." Here, he said nothing about the struggle between two classes and two roads, and forbade revolutionary students and young teachers from criticizing bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars," but instead asked them to "combine into one" with them. In reality, he wanted us to accept the decadent ideology of the exploiting classes in its entirety, to be filial sons and grandsons of the bourgeoisie, and to serve the restoration of capitalism.

    The first-year students of the Political Science Department were all from worker and peasant backgrounds. Kuang Yaming was very dissatisfied when he saw this, saying: "Why are there no students from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds in your class? You should recruit some in the future. You should find children of landlords and rich peasants in other departments to make friends with." Here, he came up with another "two combine into one," frantically opposing our Party's class line, and wanting to influence us through the children of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie.

    Kuang Yaming is using the broken weapon of "two combine into one" to serve the promotion of his revisionist education line and to serve the restoration of capitalism. Look! How clear his reactionary class nature is! Kuang Yaming, this negative teacher, makes us more aware that "two combine into one" is a thoroughly anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary fallacy.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "It is a good thing and not a bad thing to be opposed by the enemy." We must support what the enemy opposes, and oppose what the enemy supports. The more Yang Xianzhen, Kuang Yaming and their ilk oppose dividing one into two, the more we must adhere to dividing one into two. The louder their anti-"two combine into one" tune is, the higher we must hold the red flag of dividing one into two. The process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can also be said to be a process of learning, understanding, and applying the theory of dividing one into two for us. In this life-and-death class struggle, we must better use the sharp weapon of dividing one into two, take a firm stand, be clear in our attitude, thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and completely break with the ideology of all exploiting classes. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly reform the education system, implement the class line, eliminate the influence of bourgeois "authorities," "scholars," and "patriarchs," take the path of being both red and expert, and become strong and reliable proletarian revolutionary successors.

    Proletarian revolutionaries throughout the school, take action and open fire on the fanatical advocates of "two combine into one"!

### 向“合二而一”论的狂热鼓吹者开火

    向“合二而一”论的狂热鼓吹者开火
    一分为二，是客观事物的根本规律，是无产阶级的世界观，是毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是革命人民手中的锐利武器。“合二而一”，是反辩证法的修正主义谬论。反党分子匡亚明就是反动的“合二而一”论的狂热信徒和鼓吹者。这几年来，他不厌其烦地宣扬“合二而一”论，反对毛泽东思想，跟党大唱对台戏。
    一九六四年，在批判杨献珍的“合二而一”论的时候，他在课堂上和报告中大讲同一性。他愤愤不平地说：“不要因为批判‘合二而一’就不敢讲‘统一’了，‘统一’是目的。”听！他的话跟杨献珍的话，何其相似！我们批判“合二而一”，打在杨献珍身上，痛在匡亚明心里。毛主席教导我们：资产阶级“一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”匡亚明的反动的阶级本能，使得他非要跳出来为杨献珍辩护不可。
    “合二而一”论，是匡亚明反动观点的哲学依据。他在其它一系列问题上，都宣扬了“合二而一”论。
    匡亚明在谈到红与专的关系问题时，一再说：“红表现在专上”，“专的过程也就是红的过程”。在这里，他矢口否认红与专的矛盾和斗争，一笔勾销了红的统帅作用。匡亚明说的“红”，不过是装潢门面而已。实际上，他是要我们只专不红，走白专道路，成为资产阶级的接班人。
    匡亚明非常强调要搞好“师生关系”、“青老关系”。他把资产阶级“权威”、“学者”捧上了天，开口“某老”，闭口“某公”。他要我们把他们的东西先继承下来，以后再批判。甚至说，为了把他们的东西继承下来，为他们“作服务工作，倒倒尿壶，抱抱小孩也可以”。在这里，他闭口不谈两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，不准革命学生、青年教师批判资产阶级“权威”、“学者”，而去和他们“合二而一”。实际上，他是要我们把剥削阶级的腐朽意识形态全盘接受下来，做资产阶级的孝子贤孙，为资本主义复辟服务。
    政治系一年级的同学全是工农出身，匡亚明看了大为不满，说：“你们班怎么没有地富出身的，以后要招一些。你们应当到其它系找地富子女交朋友。”在这里，他又来了一条“合二而一”，疯狂地反对我们党的阶级路线，并且要通过地富、资产阶级的子女来影响我们。
    匡亚明正是用“合二而一”的破烂武器，为推行他的修正主义教育路线服务，为资本主义复辟服务。看！他的反动的阶级性是多么鲜明啊！匡亚明这个反面教员，使我们更加认识到，“合二而一”是道道地地的反党反社会主义的反革命谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。杨献珍、匡亚明之流越是反对一分为二，我们就越是要坚持一分为二。他们的“合二而一”的反调唱得越响，我们就要把一分为二的红旗举得越高。无产阶级文化大革命的过程，对我们来说，也可以说是一个学习、领会和运用一分为二学说的过程。在这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，我们要更好地运用一分为二这个锐利武器，立场坚定，态度鲜明，彻底搞掉反党反社会主义黑线，跟一切剥削阶级的意识形态彻底决裂。我们要在毛泽东思想的指导下，彻底改革教育制度，贯彻阶级路线，肃清资产阶级“权威”、“学者”、“祖师爷”的影响，走又红又专的道路，成为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命接班人。
    全校的无产阶级革命派，行动起来，向“合二而一”的狂热鼓吹者开火！
