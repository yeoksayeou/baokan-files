    Xinhua News Agency, June 15th. The China-Pakistan Friendship Association held a reception this afternoon to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its founding.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi attended the reception.

    Vice President of the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, Fang Shishan, and the Pakistani Ambassador to China, Sultan Muhammad Khan, delivered speeches at the reception. They praised the friendship between China and Pakistan and expressed their willingness to contribute to the continuous development of this friendship.

    Fang Shishan said that in recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Pakistan have achieved new development on the basis of traditional depth, making beneficial contributions to promoting Asian-African solidarity against imperialism. He said that the people of China and Pakistan sympathize with and support each other in the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, safeguarding national independence and world peace. This not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and Pakistan but also benefits the noble cause of Asian-African people's solidarity against imperialism and safeguarding world peace.

    Fang Shishan said that imperialists and expansionists are afraid of our friendship and try every possible means to undermine it. However, the friendship between the people of the two countries can stand the test and cannot be destroyed by any force. This friendship will develop from generation to generation.

    Ambassador Sultan Muhammad Khan said in his speech that Sino-Pakistan friendship is based on mutual respect and understanding. It is fully supported by the people of both countries because it is in the common interest of both countries. Both governments are making unremitting efforts to strengthen this friendship. He said that geography makes us neighbors, and history makes us friends. We have the same painful experience of being oppressed by colonialism, and this historical experience has forged our friendship.

    The Ambassador condemned the malicious anti-China propaganda spread by those who want to create tension between China and other countries. He said that we firmly believe that this anti-China propaganda can indeed harm the cause of world peace, so we oppose it. The Ambassador thanked China for its support to Pakistan in opposing foreign aggression. He said that this sincere friendship shows that the friendly relations between the people of China and Pakistan have entered a new stage.

    Also present at the reception today were Ren Yinglun, Deputy Director of the Foreign Culture Commission, Han Nianlong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other responsible persons from relevant departments.

    大使谴责那些想在中国和其他国家间制造紧张局势的人所散布的恶毒的反华宣传。他说，我们深信这种反华宣传确实能伤害世界和平事业，所以我们反对这种宣传。大使感谢中国在巴基斯坦反对外来侵略时所给予的支持。他说，这一真诚的友谊，表现了中巴两国人民的友好关系已经进入了一个新阶段。
