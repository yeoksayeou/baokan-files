    After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They are bound to fight us to the death, and we must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize this problem in this way now, we will make extremely serious mistakes.
    Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Fear Nothing
    Revolutionary Young General Liu Xiaofang Bravely Struggles in the Cultural Revolution, Undaunted by Enemy Persecution
    The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League Decides to Award Liu Xiaofang the Title of Model Communist Youth League Member, Calling on All Young People in the City to Learn from Her. Cai Sanjian, a Counter-Revolutionary Element at Guangzhou No. 45 Middle School, is Removed from All Party and Non-Party Positions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 23rd - Liu Xiaofang, a sixteen-year-old Communist Youth League member and student in Class 5 of the third grade at Guangzhou No. 45 Middle School, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She remained steadfast in the face of slander, attacks, and persecution from the counter-revolutionary element Cai Sanjian, demonstrating the hard-bone spirit of a proletarian revolutionary youth. The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to award Liu Xiaofang the title of Model Communist Youth League Member, calling on all young people in the city to learn from this revolutionary young general.
    The *Nanfang Daily* and *Guangzhou Daily* introduced Liu Xiaofang's heroic struggle on the 19th, and published editorials respectively. The *Nanfang Daily*'s editorial said that Liu Xiaofang has the "daring spirit of 'daring to unhorse the emperor'." This fully demonstrates the unparalleled love and infinite loyalty of the younger generation, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the cause of socialism. They are true revolutionaries and reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Under various persecutions from the counter-revolutionary black gang, Liu Xiaofang still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, creatively studying and applying them, which greatly increased her confidence in the struggle and greatly improved her ability to discern. Her noble qualities of loving the Party and Chairman Mao, her firm revolutionary stand, and her courageous fighting spirit are worth learning by every revolutionary youth and revolutionary mass.
    On the afternoon of the 18th, all the students of Guangzhou No. 45 Middle School held a meeting to expose Cai Sanjian, the class alien who had originally infiltrated the Party in this school, the former "Party Branch Secretary" and Vice Principal, for suppressing the revolutionary mass movement in the school with despicable and vicious means during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and illegally struggling against revolutionary student Liu Xiaofang's towering crimes. Cai Sanjian's counter-revolutionary crimes aroused the boundless anger of the revolutionary teachers and students of the whole school. The Cultural and Educational Political Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China accepted the demands of the revolutionary teachers and students and decided to remove the anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary element Cai Sanjian from all Party and non-Party positions.
    Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been vigorously carried out in various middle schools in Guangzhou, the revolutionary students of No. 45 Middle School unanimously demanded to join the battle and open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. However, Cai Sanjian has been using deceptive methods to prevent the development of the revolutionary mass movement in the school. In early June, five students in Class 1 of the third grade posted the first big-character poster, exposing Cai Sanjian and others for proposing "no opinions should be raised against teachers" in the Cultural Revolution, in an attempt to prevent students from rising up to make revolution. After reading this big-character poster, Cai Sanjian became angry and immediately convened a meeting of all teachers to instigate and arrange for teachers to stop students from posting big-character posters against school leaders and teachers. He then convened a meeting of Communist Youth League members among the students, and separately convened large meetings of students in the first, second, and third grades. On the one hand, he vigorously publicized that the Cultural Revolution in the school was "going smoothly," and on the other hand, he threatened the students, slandering the students' big-character posters criticizing teachers as "fallacies," and condoned the head teacher of Class 5 of the second grade for slamming the table and scolding the students for being "simply reactionary." He also secretly appointed his pawns to form a "six-person combat team" to suppress the students' revolutionary actions.
    Liu Xiaofang, a student and Communist Youth League member in Class 5 of the third grade, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works, especially Chairman Mao's quotations on class and class struggle, in the face of sharp and complex class struggles. She read Chairman Mao's passage word by word: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist. They are bound to fight us to the death, and we must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not raise and recognize this problem in this way now, we will make extremely serious mistakes." She felt that the struggle she was facing now was to fight against the enemies without guns. A gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in the school would definitely become more crazy in this struggle and make a final struggle. She saw through the tricks of Cai Sanjian and others, and resolutely stood up to open fire on all the monsters and demons in the school. She contacted ten students and established the "May 4th Combat Team to Defend the Party Central Committee and Defend Chairman Mao," and took the lead in making revolution. On the evening of the 12th, Liu Xiaofang and the "May 4th Combat Team" students went to the Municipal Education Bureau to report the actions of Cai Sanjian and others in attacking students' revolutionary actions, requesting the Education Bureau to approve their organization of the combat team, and requesting the higher-level Party Committee to immediately send a work team to the school to lead the Cultural Revolution. When they returned to school, Cai Sanjian instructed his accomplices to guard the gate, asking them fiercely, "Where did you go?" and insulting them that opposing Cai Sanjian was "opposing the Party." Cai Sanjian also personally came forward and called these students to scold them. Liu Xiaofang did not return to school that night. When she went to school for class the next day, Cai Sanjian instructed the head teacher Feng Dezhen to isolate Liu Xiaofang from her classmates and carry out illegal struggle against her, insisting that Liu Xiaofang "had been fooled by the enemy, did not want the leadership of the Party, wanted to seize power and seals, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution," slandering Liu Xiaofang as an "anti-Party and anti-socialist element."
    Liu Xiaofang was tortured for an afternoon. Not only was she not afraid, but she also actively encouraged the "May 4th Combat Team" students to persist in the struggle. Cai Sanjian again instructed Feng Dezhen, the head teacher of Class 5 of the third grade, to organize a meeting, and the "six-person combat team" Xia Jiahhao and others came forward to carry out illegal struggle against Liu Xiaofang. The struggle lasted from 2:30 in the afternoon to more than 6:00 in the evening, and they declared that they would continue to hold a meeting to struggle against Liu Xiaofang. After the meeting, he instructed the head teacher Feng Dezhen to go to Liu Xiaofang's home, in front of Liu Xiaofang's parents, and scold Liu Xiaofang as "shameful," "anti-Party," and "bad egg," and threatened Liu Xiaofang: "Your attitude is very bad today. When the meeting is held again tomorrow, the students will definitely beat you. I can't protect you either." And forced Liu Xiaofang to write a "confession." Liu Xiaofang answered with righteous indignation: "I did the right thing. I listened to Chairman Mao's words and actively participated in the Cultural Revolution. I did nothing wrong. I am not afraid of anything!" That night, Liu Xiaofang studied Chairman Mao's works until late at night and read many Chairman's quotations. Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." He also said: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory." She repeatedly studied these teachings of Chairman Mao. She thought: Cai Sanjian is an anti-Party and anti-socialist element, and I must resolutely struggle against him. No matter how vicious the enemy is, I must continue to struggle. Chairman Mao's words encouraged her and greatly increased her courage. The next day, she returned to school and questioned Cai Sanjian why he wanted to hold a meeting to struggle against her. Cai Sanjian spread rumors that this was the opinion of the "masses" and insisted that Liu Xiaofang "had been fooled by bad people" and "mistakenly regarded No. 45 Middle School as 'Peking University'," etc. Cai Sanjian originally wanted to continue holding a meeting to struggle against Liu Xiaofang, but because the work team sent by the Municipal Party Committee had entered the school at this time, his conspiracy did not succeed.
    At the all-school student meeting on the 18th, Liu Xiaofang angrily accused Cai Sanjian and his pawns of the detailed process of persecuting, attacking, and struggling against her. She firmly stated: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang, sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Her speech repeatedly aroused stormy applause from the audience.
    Bo Huaiqi, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also participated in the meeting and spoke at the meeting, cordially expressing condolences and praising Liu Xiaofang. He said: It is an extremely serious event that revolutionary students who stepped forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and bravely launched a resolute struggle against monsters and demons were slandered, attacked, and persecuted by a small handful of monsters and demons headed by Cai Sanjian. The Municipal Party Committee attaches great importance to this. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attacking the left and sabotaging the movement is a counter-revolutionary crime of opposing the Party and socialism. We must give a resolute counterattack to the counterattack of class enemies, discredit them, defeat them, and overthrow them, so that they will lose their prestige.
    Li Zheng, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Political Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced at the meeting: The anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary element Cai Sanjian is removed from all Party and non-Party positions, and the "six-person combat team" is disbanded. At this time, there was thunderous cheers throughout the audience, and the students kept shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" (Attached picture)

    在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。
    听毛主席的话，什么也不怕
    革命小将刘肖芳在文化大革命中英勇斗争遭受敌人迫害毫不动摇
    共青团广州市委决定授予刘肖芳模范共青团员称号，号召全市青年向她学习。广州市四十五中学反革命分子蔡三坚被撤销党内外一切职务
    新华社广州二十三日电　广州市四十五中学初三（五）班学生、十六岁的共青团员刘肖芳，在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，在反革命分子蔡三坚的诬蔑、打击和迫害面前毫不动摇，坚持斗争，表现了无产阶级革命青年的硬骨头精神。共青团广州市委员会决定授予刘肖芳模范共青团员的称号，号召全市青年向这位革命小将学习。
    《南方日报》和《广州日报》十九日介绍了刘肖芳的英勇斗争事迹，并分别发表了社论。《南方日报》的社论说，刘肖芳具有“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏精神。这充分表现了在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的年青一代，对党、对毛主席、对社会主义事业的无比热爱和无限忠诚。他们是真正的革命派，是可靠的无产阶级革命事业接班人。刘肖芳在受到反革命黑帮种种迫害的情况下，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作，活学活用，斗争信心百倍增加，鉴别能力大大提高。她这种热爱党、热爱毛主席的高贵品质和坚定的革命立场，勇敢的斗争精神，值得每一个革命青年和革命群众学习。
    十八日下午，广州市四十五中学全体学生举行大会，揭发了这个学校原来混进党内的阶级异己分子、原“党支部书记”、副校长蔡三坚，在无产阶级文化大革命中，以卑鄙毒辣的手段，镇压校内的革命群众运动，非法斗争革命学生刘肖芳的滔天罪行。蔡三坚的反革命罪行激起了全校革命师生的无比愤怒。中共广州市委文教政治部接受革命师生的要求，决定撤销反党反社会主义的反革命分子蔡三坚党内外一切职务。
    无产阶级文化大革命在广州市各中学轰轰烈烈开展以来，市四十五中的革命学生一致要求投身战斗，向反党反社会主义黑线开火。但蔡三坚一直采取欺骗的手法，阻止校内革命群众运动的开展。六月上旬，这个学校初三（一）班五位学生贴出了第一张大字报，揭露了蔡三坚等提出在文化大革命中“不准向老师提意见”，妄图阻挠学生起来革命的行径。蔡三坚看了这张大字报后，恼羞成怒，马上召开全体教师会议，煽动和布置教师分头阻止学生对学校领导和教师贴大字报。他接着召集学生中的共青团员开会，又分别召集初一、二、三年级的学生开大会，一方面大事宣扬校内文化大革命“一直顺利进行”，另方面对学生进行威吓，诬蔑学生批评教师的大字报是“谬论”，并纵容初二（五）班班主任拍桌大骂学生“简直是反动”。他还暗中指定他的爪牙组成“六人战斗小组”来压制学生的革命行动。
    初三（五）班学生、共青团员刘肖芳，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争面前，反复学习毛主席著作，特别是毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的语录。她一字一句地读了毛主席的这段话：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”她感到，现在面临的斗争，就是和不拿枪的敌人作斗争。学校里的一帮反党反社会主义分子，在这场斗争中一定会变得更加疯狂，要作最后的挣扎。她看穿了蔡三坚等人的鬼计，便坚决站出来向校内一切牛鬼蛇神开火。她串连了十个同学，成立了“保卫党中央、保卫毛主席‘五·四’战斗小组”，带头起来闹革命。十二日晚，刘肖芳和“五·四战斗小组”同学到市教育局，反映蔡三坚等打击学生革命行动的行径，要求教育局批准他们组织战斗小组，并要求上级党委立即派工作队到学校领导文化大革命。当他们回校时，蔡三坚指使他的同伙把守着门口，恶狠狠地质问他们“到那里去了？”并辱骂他们反对蔡三坚就是“反党”。蔡三坚还亲自出马，把这几位同学叫去骂了一顿。这天晚上刘肖芳没有回校，当她第二天到校上课时，蔡三坚指使班主任冯德贞把刘肖芳同班里同学隔离开来，对她进行非法斗争，硬说刘肖芳“上了敌人的当，不要党的领导，想夺权、夺印，破坏文化大革命”，诬蔑刘肖芳是“反党反社会主义分子”。
    刘肖芳被折磨了一个下午，她不但毫无畏惧，还积极鼓励“五·四战斗小组”的同学坚持斗争。蔡三坚又指使初三（五）班主任冯德贞组织了一个大会，由“六人战斗小组”夏家豪等出马，对刘肖芳进行非法斗争。由下午两点半斗到晚上六点多，并声言要继续开会斗争刘肖芳。会后，他又指使班主任冯德贞到刘肖芳家里，当着刘肖芳父母的面，大骂刘肖芳“可耻”、“反党”、“坏蛋”，并恐吓刘肖芳说：“今天你的态度很恶劣，明天再开会时，同学们一定会打你。我也保不住你。”并强迫刘肖芳写“悔过书”。刘肖芳理直气壮地回答：“我做得对，我听毛主席的话，积极参加文化大革命，我没有错，我什么也不怕！”当晚，刘肖芳学习毛主席著作学到深夜，读了很多主席语录。毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”又说：要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”她反复地学习了毛主席这些教导，她想：蔡三坚是反党反社会主义分子，我就要坚决同他斗争，不论敌人多么凶恶，我都要继续斗争下去。毛主席的话鼓励了她，使她勇气大增。第二天她回校质问蔡三坚为什么要开会斗她，蔡三坚造谣说这是“群众”意见，还硬说刘肖芳“上了坏人的当”，“把四十五中错当成‘北大’”等等。蔡三坚原想继续开会斗争刘肖芳，因为这时市委派来的工作队已进校，他的阴谋才没有得逞。
    在十八日全校学生大会上，刘肖芳愤怒地控诉了蔡三坚及其爪牙迫害、打击、斗争她的详细经过，她坚决表示：一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决向反党反社会主义黑帮开火，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。她的讲话一再激起全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    中共广州市委书记处书记薄怀奇也参加了这个大会，并在会上讲话，亲切慰问和表扬了刘肖芳。他说：在无产阶级文化大革命中挺身而出，勇敢地同牛鬼蛇神展开坚决的斗争的革命学生，竟遭到以蔡三坚为首的一小撮牛鬼蛇神诬蔑、打击和迫害，这是一个极端严重的事件，市委对此非常重视。在无产阶级文化大革命中，打击左派、破坏运动，就是反党反社会主义的反革命罪行。对待阶级敌人的反扑，我们必须给予坚决的回击，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，使他们威风扫地。
    中共广州市委文教政治部副主任李征在会上宣布：撤销反党反社会主义的反革命分子蔡三坚党内外一切职务，解散“六人战斗小组”。这时，全场欢声雷动，学生们不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”（附图片）
