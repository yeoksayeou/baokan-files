    Chairman Mao Brings Us Sweet Water
    Tongxin County, Ningxia, has built a brackish water desalination plant, completely solving the problem of drinking and industrial water for the county seat and nearby communes, and providing experience for our country's brackish water desalination research and solving the drinking water problem for people in other brackish water areas.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 18th) Tongxin County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, recently built a brackish water desalination plant, completely solving the problem of drinking and industrial water for the county seat and nearby communes in this Hui ethnic group settlement.
    This brackish water desalination plant was designed by the Northwest Water Supply and Drainage Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. It uses the principle of multi-stage distillation to repeatedly vaporize and condense the local brackish water to produce fresh water. It can produce 115 tons of fresh water per day. The quality of the desalinated water has been tested by relevant departments and fully meets the national drinking water standards.
    On the day the brackish water desalination plant supplied water, many Hui commune members and cadres ran around spreading the news, rejoicing and eagerly tasting the fresh water. The poor and lower-middle peasants' representatives who were in the county seat participating in the Second County Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress were very excited after drinking the fresh water sent by the water plant in trucks for the first time. They said, "The brackish water has turned sweet! What our ancestors have dreamed of for many years has become a reality today!" An eighty-five-year-old Hui elder with white hair held a cup of fresh water and said, "I have lived through three dynasties and have never drunk such sweet water. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao for bringing us Hui people such benefits!" Many representatives could not restrain their inner excitement and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!"
    Tongxin County is located on a plateau more than 1,300 meters above sea level in southern Ningxia. The climate here is dry and rainfall is scarce. Most of the county's groundwater and river water is brackish. This water contains excessive minerals, tastes bitter and astringent, and often causes bloating and diarrhea after drinking.
    Before liberation, the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Hongkui bandit gangs did not care about the suffering of the Hui people at all. The broad masses of Hui laborers, apart from collecting a little rainwater with basins and pots when it rained, or collecting a little rainwater from underground water pits, could not drink a sip of fresh water all year round. In Chengguan Town, where the Hui people lived, only eight households of landlords, chiefs, and reactionary Ahongs had water cellars. The laboring masses ate and used brackish water. After liberation, in order to solve the drinking water problem for the local people, the Party and the People's Government successively helped various communes build more than 30,000 water cellars for storing rainwater and snow, so that the people in most parts of the county basically solved the problem of drinking fresh water. This brackish water desalination plant was built to solve the problem of drinking and industrial water for the residents of the county seat and the members of Chengguan Commune, where the population is concentrated and there is a severe shortage of water. In the process of building the plant, the design and construction personnel, full of deep class feelings, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, modestly learned from the successful experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in seawater desalination, broke with "foreign dogmas" and "foreign frameworks," and overcame numerous technical difficulties, thereby achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This brackish water desalination plant is the product of socialist large-scale collaboration. In the process of design and construction, it received strong support and enthusiastic assistance from more than a dozen units across the country.
    The completion of the Tongxin County brackish water desalination plant has provided useful experience for our country's brackish water desalination research and solving the problem of drinking and industrial water for people in other brackish water areas.

    毛主席给我们带来的甜水
    宁夏同心县建成一座苦水淡化厂，彻底解决了县城和附近社队群众生活用水和工业用水问题，并为我国苦水淡化研究工作和解决其他苦水地区人民吃水用水问题提供了经验
    据新华社银川十八日电　宁夏回族自治区同心县最近建成一座苦水淡化厂，彻底解决了这个回族聚居县县城和附近社队群众生活用水和工业用水问题。
    这座苦水淡化厂是由建筑工程部西北给排水设计院设计的。它是应用多级蒸馏的原理，把当地的苦水多次汽化冰凝而制取淡水的。它每日能生产淡水一百一十五吨。淡化后的水质，经有关部门化验完全符合国家饮用水的规定标准。
    在苦水淡化厂供水的那天，许多回族社员、干部奔走相告，欢天喜地，争尝淡水。正在县城参加全县第二次贫下中农代表大会的贫下中农代表，第一次喝了水厂用汽车送来的淡水之后，十分激动地说：“苦水变甜了，我们祖祖辈辈多少年来梦想的事，今天成了现实。”一位八十五岁的白发苍苍的回族老大爷，捧着一杯淡水说：“我活了三个朝代，都没喝过这样甜的水，这都是毛主席他老人家给我们回族人民带来的好处啊！”许多代表抑制不住内心的激动，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    同心县位于宁夏南部海拔一千三百多米的高原上。这里气候干燥，雨量稀少。这个县绝大部分的地下水、河水都是苦水。这种水含有过量的矿物质，味苦涩，饮用后常常引起肚胀腹泻。
    解放前，蒋介石、马鸿逵匪帮根本不关心回族人民的疾苦。广大回族劳动人民除了在下雨时，拿着盆盆罐罐接上一点雨水，从地下水坑里收起一点雨水外，常年喝不上一口淡水。回族聚居的城关镇，五十多户人家，只有八户地主、保长、甲长和反动阿訇有水窖，劳动群众吃的用的都是苦水。解放后，为了解决当地人民的吃水问题，党和人民政府先后帮助各社队打了三万多口贮藏雨雪的水窖，使全县大部分地区的人民基本上解决了饮用淡水的问题。这座苦水淡化厂，就是为了解决人口集中的严重缺水的县城居民和城关公社社员生活用水和工业用水而建设的。在建厂过程中，设计和施工等人员满怀深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，虚心学习中国人民解放军海水淡化的成功经验，打破了“洋教条”，“洋框框”，冲破了重重技术难关，从而做到了多快好省。这座苦水淡化厂是社会主义大协作的产物。在设计、施工过程中，它得到全国十几个单位的大力支持和热情帮助。
    同心县苦水淡化厂的建成，为我国的苦水淡化研究工作和解决其他苦水地区人民吃水用水问题提供了有益的经验。
