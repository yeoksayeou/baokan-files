    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th -- Zeng Sheng, head of the Chinese Guangdong Province Friendship Delegation, which is currently on a friendly visit to Japan, refuted the erroneous viewpoint propagated by some people that "the new Soviet leadership is not so bad and is changing in a good direction" at a mass rally held in Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, on the 17th.

    Zeng Sheng pointed out that the new Soviet leadership is worse and more cunning than Khrushchev. He said that modern revisionism is a traitor within the ranks of the revolutionary people, and it cooperates with U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people and the people of the world. Zeng Sheng said that the new Soviet leadership is not changing in a good direction, but is changing in a worse and more cunning direction. They have degenerated into traitors to Marxism-Leninism and accomplices of U.S. imperialism. It plays a role that no imperialism or reactionaries could possibly play.

    Zeng Sheng pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionist leading group is playing a counter-revolutionary two-faced policy toward the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. On the one hand, it verbally says it will aid Vietnam, and on the other hand, it is serving the "peace talks" plot of U.S. imperialism. Its aim is to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. anger.

    Zeng Sheng said that the new Soviet leadership has done many bad things. In order to adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism, it convened the March 1965 Moscow split meeting. It also instructed all kinds of renegades to carry out sabotage and intimidation against Marxist-Leninist parties in various countries.

    Zeng Sheng said that the new Soviet leadership is worse than Khrushchev, and is also manifested in the fact that they are pushing the Soviet Union further down the road of capitalism. At the same time, internationally, it is pursuing a line of cooperation with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world, opposing Marxist-Leninist socialist countries and national liberation movements.

    Zeng Sheng said that the negative "experience" of modern revisionism that has appeared in the Soviet Union should be well summarized, and vigilance must be heightened and resolute struggle waged against the conspiracy of modern revisionism to restore capitalism.

    Zeng Sheng and others also answered questions raised by people about China's socialist construction and China's trade policy towards Japan at the rally.

    Zeng Sheng and others visited Mishima City, Shizuoka Prefecture, on the morning of the 17th and then arrived in Numazu. They were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life and the broad masses in Mishima and Numazu. In Mishima and Numazu, Japanese friends held welcome receptions for the delegation.

    曾生团长在日本沼津市群众欢迎集会上讲话
    苏共新领导比赫鲁晓夫更坏更狡猾
    所谓“苏共新领导并不那么坏，而且朝着好的方向变”的观点是完全错误的
    新华社东京二十日电　正在日本进行友好访问的中国广东省友好代表团团长曾生十七日在静冈县沼津市群众举行的一次欢迎集会上，驳斥了某些人宣扬“苏共新领导并不那么坏，而且朝着好的方向变”的错误观点。
    曾生指出苏共新领导比赫鲁晓夫更坏更狡猾。他说，现代修正主义是革命人民队伍中的叛徒，它配合美帝国主义反对中国人民和世界人民。曾生说，苏共新领导不是向好的方向转变，而是在向更坏、更狡猾的方向转变，他们已经堕落成为马克思列宁主义的叛徒，美帝国主义的帮凶。它起着任何帝国主义、反动派都不可能起的作用。
    曾生指出，苏联现代修正主义领导集团对越南人民的抗美救国斗争玩弄着反革命的两手政策，一方面口头上说要援助越南，另一方面又在为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋效劳。它的目的是要扑灭越南人民的抗美怒火。
    曾生说，苏共新领导做了很多坏事，它为了适应美帝国主义的需要，在一九六五年召开了三月莫斯科分裂会议，它还指示形形色色的变节分子对各国的马克思列宁主义政党进行破坏和恐吓。
    曾生说，苏共新领导比赫鲁晓夫更坏，还表现在他们把苏联更加推向资本主义的道路；同时在国际上，它推行着同美帝国主义合作主宰世界的路线，反对马克思列宁主义的社会主义国家和民族解放运动。
    曾生说，对于苏联出现的现代修正主义的反面“经验”要很好地加以总结，对现代修正主义复辟资本主义的阴谋必须提高警惕和坚决斗争。
    曾生等在集会上还回答了人们提出的关于中国的社会主义建设和中国对日贸易政策等问题。
    曾生等是十七日上午访问了静冈县三岛市后到达沼津的，他们在三岛和沼津受到当地的各界人士和广大群众的热烈欢迎。在三岛、沼津市，日本朋友曾为代表团举行了欢迎酒会。
