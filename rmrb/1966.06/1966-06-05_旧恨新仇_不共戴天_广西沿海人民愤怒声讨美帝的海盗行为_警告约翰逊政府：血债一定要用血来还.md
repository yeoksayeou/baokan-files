    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th - The sky-high crime of U.S. imperialist military aircraft bombing and strafing our fishing boats on the high seas in the Beibu Gulf on May 28th, killing and wounding 21 of our fishermen, has aroused boundless anger among the people of all ethnic groups in the coastal areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In recent days, they have held rallies to denounce the piratical acts of U.S. imperialism, and severely warned the Johnson government that the blood debt owed to the Chinese people must be paid in blood!
    Today, in Dongxing Multinational Autonomous County, on the banks of the Beilun River, people of all ethnic groups held a denunciation rally. More than 5,000 workers, fishermen, militiamen, PLA soldiers, cadres, and students attending the meeting, filled with anger, took to the stage to denounce the towering crimes of U.S. imperialism. "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Blood debt must be paid in blood!" Angry slogans rose one after another, resounding throughout the venue.
    Zhai Xingmei, a fisherman from Qisha Commune in Dongxing Multinational Autonomous County, pointing to the scars inflicted by the American bandit aircraft, accused them of bombing and strafing fishing boats flying our national flag on the high seas in a blatant manner, and inhumanely murdering my wife, Huang Fengying, who was four months pregnant, killing my three-year-old daughter, and also wounding me and my son. This is evidence of the Johnson government's military provocation against the Chinese people. We will never forget this blood debt that U.S. imperialism owes to the Chinese people, and we must settle this blood debt. Zhai Xingmei said that the bloody atrocities of U.S. imperialism will absolutely not frighten the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. He said that after recovering from his injuries, he will study Chairman Mao's works even harder, improve preparedness, actively engage in production, and use practical actions of fishing for the revolution to support the socialist revolution of the motherland and the world revolution, and avenge his deceased relatives and all class brothers killed by U.S. imperialism!
    Wu Wenting, a Jing ethnic militiaman who attended the National Militia Representative Conference, representing the militia of the entire county, accused the U.S. imperialism in the denunciation meeting that U.S. imperialism owes the Chinese people countless blood debts, old and new hatreds, all surging to the heart together. All ethnic militias must engrave the hatred of U.S. imperialism on the tip of their bayonets, heighten their vigilance a hundredfold, hold their guns tightly, and be ready at any time to strike against the American robbers who dare to invade, and demand the Johnson government pay the blood debt.
    Shang Xianzheng, Deputy County Chief of Dongxing Multinational Autonomous County, on behalf of the Dongxing County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Committee, and the people of the entire county, expressed deep condolences to the injured fishermen and the families of the deceased at the meeting. He pointed out that the U.S. military aircraft frantically bombed and strafed our fishing boats on the high seas, killing our fishermen, indicating that the Johnson government is the most barbaric and brutal aggressive robber of our time. He called on the people of the entire county to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, firmly remember the bloody hatred against U.S. imperialism, earnestly improve preparedness, and be ready at any time to give the aggressive U.S. imperialism severe punishment.
    Since May 28th, fishermen from many communes in this county, as well as more than 1,500 fishermen and militiamen of all ethnic groups in Beihai City, have also held rallies one after another, angrily denouncing the towering crimes of U.S. imperialism in barbarously killing our fishermen.

    旧恨新仇  不共戴天
    广西沿海人民愤怒声讨美帝的海盗行为
    警告约翰逊政府：血债一定要用血来还
    新华社南宁四日电　美帝国主义军用飞机五月二十八日在北部湾公海轰炸扫射我国渔船，并打死打伤我国渔民二十一人的滔天罪行，激起了广西壮族自治区沿海各族人民的无比愤怒。他们连日举行集会，声讨美帝国主义的海盗行为，严重警告约翰逊政府对中国人民欠下的血债，一定要用血来还！
    今天，在北仑河畔的东兴各族自治县，各族人民举行声讨大会，五千多名到会的工人、渔民、民兵、解放军战士、干部和学生，怀着满腔怒火，纷纷上台控诉美帝国主义的滔天罪行，“打倒美帝国主义！”“血债一定要用血来还！”愤怒的口号声，此起彼伏，响彻了整个会场。
    东兴各族自治县企沙公社渔民翟杏美指着美国飞贼打伤他的伤痕控诉说，美国飞机明目张胆地在公海上轰炸扫射挂有我国国旗的渔船，惨无人道地杀害了我怀孕四个月的妻子黄凤英，杀死了我三岁的女儿，还把我和我的儿子打伤，这是约翰逊政府对中国人民进行军事挑衅的见证。美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的这笔血债我们一辈子也不会忘记，这笔血债我们一定要清算。翟杏美说，美帝国主义的血腥暴行绝对吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民。他表示养好伤以后，要更加努力学习毛主席著作，搞好战备，积极生产，用为革命捕鱼的实际行动，支援祖国社会主义革命和世界革命，为死去的亲人和所有被美帝国主义杀害的阶级兄弟报仇！
    曾经出席全国民兵代表会议的京族民兵吴文廷，代表全县民兵在声讨大会上控诉说，美帝国主义对中国人民欠下了累累血债，旧恨新仇，一齐涌向心头。各族民兵一定要把对美帝国主义的仇恨刻在刺刀尖上，百倍提高警惕，紧握手中枪，随时准备打击敢于来犯的美国强盗，向约翰逊政府讨还血债。
    东兴各族自治县副县长尚宪政代表中共东兴县委、人委和全县人民，在会上向受伤渔民和死者家属表示深切地慰问。他指出，美国军用飞机在公海上疯狂地对我渔船进行轰炸扫射，杀害我渔民，表明约翰逊政府是当代最野蛮、最残暴的侵略强盗。他号召全县人民，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，牢记对美帝国主义的血海深仇，切实搞好战备，随时准备给侵略成性的美帝国主义严厉惩罚。
    五月二十八日以来，这个县许多公社的渔民，以及北海市的一千五百多名各族渔民和民兵，也先后举行集会，愤怒声讨美帝国主义野蛮杀害我国渔民的滔天罪行。
