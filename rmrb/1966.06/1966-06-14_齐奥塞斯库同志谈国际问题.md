    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 12th - According to the Romanian News Agency, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, Ceaușescu, said at a mass rally in the city of Pitești on the 10th that while we are actively engaged in peaceful labor, we must not forget that there are still imperialist and reactionary forces in the world that endanger the freedom of all peoples, carry out conspiracies, and commit acts of aggression like those committed by American imperialism in Vietnam and other parts of the world. Therefore, while strengthening our country's economy, we must also strengthen our defense capabilities and combat effectiveness.
    Ceaușescu said, "We must not forget that Europe suffered two devastating wars in the first half of this century. Europe, as the cradle of modern civilization, which has made many contributions to mankind, still plays an important role and bears a major responsibility in safeguarding world peace today. Therefore, our party believes that it must actively struggle to consolidate European security, to develop mutual trust and cooperative relations among the peoples of Europe on the basis of respecting independence and sovereignty, non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and complete equality among all nations. This is the reliable way to achieve genuine security and develop cooperation between the peoples of European countries with different social systems."
    Ceaușescu continued, "Of course, we cannot fail to consider the fact that American troops are still stationed in Europe, and the American imperialists are supporting the most reactionary forces in West Germany and other European countries. Therefore, the struggle for European security must be carried out at the same time as the struggle to withdraw all foreign troops from Europe, to withdraw all foreign troops from other countries' territories, to abolish foreign bases, and to oppose the atomic threat. This is closely related to the interests of the peoples of all European countries. We are full of determination to make a positive contribution to the realization of these aspirations, so that Europe can make a full contribution to the peace and security of the whole world."
    Ceaușescu emphasized, "We believe that the peoples of European countries can live together in peace. Military blocs are obstacles to the path of cooperation among the peoples of all countries. Therefore, it is time to dissolve the aggressive treaty of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty as a consequence of this treaty, in order to establish relations between European countries on a new basis. This is the road to European security."
    Ceaușescu said, "Of course, we know that this cannot be accomplished overnight, but only by taking this path can European peace be realized."
    Ceaușescu pointed out that, of course, while the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization still exists, Romania, like the other signatories of the Warsaw Treaty, will strengthen its vigilance and improve its defense capabilities. "Our party and our government concentrate their efforts on developing the economy, taking the development of cooperation and friendly relations with all socialist countries as the center of their foreign policy, and striving for the unity of the socialist countries and the international communist movement—the guarantee of the victory of the peace forces throughout the world."
    Ceaușescu said that we resolutely advocate stopping the American aggression against Vietnam and resolutely advocate the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Let the Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs without foreign interference.

    齐奥塞斯库同志谈国际问题
    新华社布加勒斯特十二日电　据罗马尼亚通讯社报道：罗马尼亚共产党中央委员会总书记齐奥塞斯库十日在皮特什蒂市的群众集会上说，我们在积极进行和平劳动的时候，不能忘记世界上还存在着帝国主义势力和反动势力，它们危害着各国人民的自由，施展阴谋诡计，干着美帝国主义在越南和世界其他地区所干出的那种侵略行为。因此，我们在加强本国的经济的同时，也要加强我国的防御能力和战斗能力。
    齐奥塞斯库说，“我们不能忘记，欧洲在本世纪的上半期经受了两次毁灭性的战争。作为现代文明的摇篮、为人类作了许多贡献的欧洲，今天在保障世界和平方面仍然起着重要作用并承担着重大的责任。因此，我们党认为，它必须为巩固欧洲安全、为在尊重独立和主权、不干涉他国内政、各民族完全平等的原则基础上发展欧洲各国人民间相互信任和合作的关系而积极地进行斗争。这是实现真正安全、发展欧洲不同社会制度国家人民之间合作的可靠途径。”
    齐奥塞斯库接着说，“当然，我们不能不考虑这样一个事实，即，在欧洲还驻扎着美国的军队，美帝国主义者正在支持西德和欧洲其他国家中最反动的势力。因此，争取欧洲安全的斗争必须同争取从欧洲撤出一切外国军队、争取从别国领土上撤出一切外国军队、争取废除外国基地、反对原子威胁的斗争同时进行。这同欧洲各国人民息息相关。我们充满决心为实现这些愿望作出积极的贡献，以便使欧洲对全世界的和平和安全作出充分的贡献”。
    齐奥塞斯库强调指出，“我们认为欧洲各国人民能够和平相处。军事集团是各国人民合作道路上的障碍。因此，是该解散北大西洋公约组织的侵略条约和作为这一条约的后果的华沙条约，以便在新的基础上确立欧洲各国的关系的时候了。这是欧洲安全的道路。”
    齐奥塞斯库说，“我们当然知道，这不是一朝一夕就可以办到的事，但是只有走这条路才能实现欧洲和平。”
    齐奥塞斯库指出，当然，在侵略性的北大西洋公约集团还存在的时候，罗马尼亚和华沙条约的其他缔约国一样，将加强警惕性，提高自己的防御能力。“我们党和我国政府集中力量发展经济，把发展同所有社会主义国家的合作和友好关系作为对外政策的中心，为社会主义国家和国际共产主义运动的团结——全世界和平力量获胜的保证——而努力。”
    齐奥塞斯库说，我们十分坚决地主张制止美国对越南的侵略，坚决主张美国军队从越南撤出去。让越南人民在没有外来干涉的情况下自己解决自己的内部事务。
