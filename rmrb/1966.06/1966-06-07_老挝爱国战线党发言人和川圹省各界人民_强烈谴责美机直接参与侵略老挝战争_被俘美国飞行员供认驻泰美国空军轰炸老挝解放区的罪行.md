    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai Dispatch: According to a radio broadcast from Pathet Lao on the 1st, Sisana Sisane, spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in openly sending aircraft to directly participate in the war of aggression against Laos at a press conference held in the Lao liberated area on May 28.

    Sisana Sisane said that U.S. imperialism continues to interfere in and invade Laos, turning Laos into its new-type colony and war base. Recently, U.S. imperialism has also frantically used B-52 strategic bombers to drop thousands of tons of bombs on the Lao liberated areas.

    Sisana Sisane refuted the shameless lies fabricated by the United States and its running dogs to cover up their crimes of aggression, claiming that the airstrikes against Laos were only to "prevent the Communists from invading South Vietnam through Laos."

    At the press conference, Sisana Sisane announced the written confession and recorded confession of U.S. pilot Dale Davis Lewis Hadlicka, who was captured alive by the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians near Sam Neua City on May 18 of last year.

    This U.S. pilot confessed to his crimes, saying that he was stationed at the U.S. Air Force Base in Takli, Thailand, and on May 18, he received an order from the U.S. Department of Defense to fly to Laos to bomb the liberated areas. On that day, he flew from the Takli base to Da Nang, South Vietnam, to pick up bombs, and was captured while bombing Xieng Khouang Province, Laos.

    Sisana Sisane warned that if they stubbornly continue on the path of military adventure of aggression against Laos and continue to trample on the independence and sovereignty of Laos, then they must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai Dispatch: According to a radio broadcast from Pathet Lao on the 2nd, 3,200 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, recently held a rally, strongly protesting and condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in sending troops and aircraft to attack and raid the Lao liberated areas.

    The rally respectively adopted letters to the King of Laos, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, resolutely demanding that the United States immediately withdraw all its and its servants' military personnel, troops, and weapons from Laos, demanding that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs stop "sweeping," plundering, and suppressing the Lao people, and immediately abandon their plan to attack the Lao liberated areas in the rainy season.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai Dispatch: According to a radio broadcast from Pathet Lao on the 3rd, the spokesperson of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a statement on the 2nd, condemning U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for stepping up the establishment of air force bases in Laos.

    The statement said that it is obvious that the purpose of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in expanding airports, building strategic highways, and expanding barracks is to prepare for the entry of the U.S. Army into Laos in order to continue to strengthen the U.S. "special war" against Laos, establish a "Mekong River defense line," and attempt to occupy Laos for a long time. At the same time, it is also to continue to create conditions for carrying out destructive wars against North Vietnam, wars of aggression against South Vietnam, and provocations and threats against Cambodia.

    The statement warned that all the air force bases illegally established by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Laos cannot threaten the heroic fighting spirit of the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians, but can only further expose their aggressive and bellicose faces, and at the same time, cannot enable them to escape their shameful defeat. The Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians have sufficient strength to destroy all the air force bases of U.S. imperialism and their robber planes.

    老挝爱国战线党发言人和川圹省各界人民
    强烈谴责美机直接参与侵略老挝战争
    被俘美国飞行员供认驻泰美国空军轰炸老挝解放区的罪行
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台一日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央发言人西沙纳·西山五月二十八日在老挝解放区举行的记者招待会上，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗公开派飞机直接参与侵略老挝战争的罪行。
    西沙纳·西山说，美帝国主义继续干涉和侵略老挝，把老挝变成它的新型殖民地和战争基地。最近，美帝国主义还疯狂使用Ｂ—52型战略轰炸机对老挝解放区投下成千吨的炸弹。
    西沙纳·西山驳斥美国及其走狗为掩盖它们的侵略罪行，而捏造了什么对老挝进行空袭只是为了“阻止共产党通过老挝侵入南越”的无耻谎言。
    西沙纳·西山在记者招待会上公布了老挝爱国军民去年五月十八日在桑怒市附近生俘的美国飞行员达戴维·路易斯·哈德利卡的书面供词以及他的供词录音。
    这个美国飞行员供认他的罪状说，他驻在泰国打卡里美国空军基地，五月十八日接到美国国防部的命令，驾驶飞机去老挝轰炸解放区。当天他从打卡里基地驾飞机到南越岘港领取炸弹后，到老挝桑怒省轰炸时被俘。
    西沙纳·西山警告说，如果它们顽固地沿着侵略老挝的军事冒险道路走下去，继续践踏老挝的独立和主权，那么，它们必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台二日广播：老挝川圹省各族各界人民三千二百人最近举行集会，强烈抗议和控诉美帝国主义及其走狗派遣军队和飞机进攻和袭击老挝解放区的滔天罪行。
    集会分别通过了给老挝国王、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会和日内瓦会议两主席的信件，坚决要求美国立即把它的以及其仆从的军事人员、军队、武器全部撤出老挝，要求美帝国主义及其走狗停止对老挝人民进行“扫荡”、掠夺和镇压，立即放弃在雨季中进攻老挝解放区的计划。
  据新华社康开四日电　据巴特寮电台三日广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人二日发表声明，谴责美帝国主义及其走狗加紧在老挝建立空军基地。
    声明说，很明显，美帝国主义及其走狗扩建机场、修建战略公路和扩建兵营的目的是为了美国陆军进驻老挝作准备，以便继续加强美国对老挝的“特种战争”，建立“湄公河防线”，妄图长期侵占老挝。同时，也为了继续对越南北方进行破坏性战争，对越南南方进行侵略战争和对柬埔寨挑衅和威胁创造条件。
    声明警告说：美帝国主义及其走狗在老挝非法建立起来的所有空军基地，威胁不了老挝爱国军民的英勇斗争精神，只能更进一步地暴露出它们的侵略和好战面目，同时，也无法使它们摆脱可耻的失败。老挝爱国军民具有足够的力量来摧毁美帝国主义的所有空军基地和它们的强盗飞机。
