    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The broad masses of revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang, and Xi'an resolutely support the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to reform the higher education enrollment examination methods, and warmly agree with the revolutionary initiatives put forward in the two letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao from the students of Class Four, Senior Three, of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Class Five, Senior Three, of Beijing No. 4 Middle School. The broad masses of revolutionary students and teachers stated: This wise and great decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has great historical significance, is a heavy blow to the old educational ideas and old educational system of the exploiting classes that have ruled for thousands of years, is another new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is a new victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

    When the radio broadcast this inspiring news last night, the broad masses of revolutionary students and teachers were jubilant, raising their arms and shouting: Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao! Revolutionary students and teachers in these cities beat drums and gongs, enthusiastically sang revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," enthusiastically wrote big-character posters and news bulletins, and wrote letters of determination and telegrams of respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In Shanghai, after the news was broadcast, hundreds of graduating high school students gathered in front of the *Jiefang Daily* in a very short time to send letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Many students in Chengdu held meetings late at night and paraded in the rain to express their heartfelt gratitude for this decision. Student representatives from more than fifty middle schools in Wuhan held a joyful gathering at the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League this morning. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" resounded throughout the venue.

    The broad masses of revolutionary students and teachers angrily denounced the harm of the old education system and resolutely stated that they must carry this unprecedented great revolution to thoroughly reform the old education system through to the end. An enthusiastic graduating high school student from Shanghai No. 1 Middle School said: The old enrollment examination system is killing people! It serves the bourgeois conspiracy to restore capitalism, and it is cultivating successors for the bourgeoisie. We must thoroughly make revolution under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. A student from Class Four of Senior Three said: We want to take exams in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. Our examination halls are in factories and rural areas; studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way is the most important content of our exams. Students and teachers from Shanghai No. 2 Girls' Middle School and many other schools said: We have long been looking forward to reforming the higher education enrollment examination methods. Now, the students of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and No. 4 Middle School have spoken our minds, and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have made a wise and correct decision in a timely manner. We must resolutely smash the reactionary, bloodless bourgeois education system under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, break through all the obstructions of bourgeois representatives and bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and create a proletarian revolutionary education cause and education system. More than a thousand teachers and students at Liaoning Provincial Experimental Middle School cheered after hearing the broadcast. In a telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the graduating class of this school said: "Dear Party, beloved Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts! Your wise decision has liberated us from the old education system!" As early as June 6, students in Class Three of Senior Three at this school wrote to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to smash the old education system and make thorough revolution, and vowing not to leave the school until this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out well.

    Ji Chunsheng, a second-year student in the Mathematics Department of Northwest University, used his personal experience to expose the harm of the old enrollment examination system. Two years ago, when he took the university entrance exam, he desperately drilled into books in pursuit of scores and relaxed his ideological remolding. Therefore, after entering university, bourgeois individualism grew somewhat, greatly affecting his progress. Ji Chunsheng said that the old education system harmed him. He expressed his heartfelt support for the major decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to reform the enrollment examination system. He said: In the future, we must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, combine with workers and peasants, and take the revolutionary path. Not only should middle school students go to the workers and peasants to receive ideological graduation certificates, but we college students should also go to the workers and peasants to receive ideological graduation certificates.

    This decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council was especially enthusiastically cheered by the children of the broad masses of workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants. Feng Yongshu, a poor peasant student in the senior year of Chengdu No. 4 Middle School, said: "This decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council fully demonstrates the trust and hope in us to be good revolutionary successors." Feng Yongshu said that when he was in elementary school, there were many children of poor and lower-middle peasants in his class. After he entered junior high school, only a few students in his class were children of poor and lower-middle peasants. By the time he got to high school, he was the only child of a poor and lower-middle peasant in the whole class.

    He said: "The original education system could not cultivate revolutionary successors in any way. It limited the opportunities for our children of poor and lower-middle peasants to enter school, and it was a shackle added to our young generation, which must be thoroughly removed!" Li Yaqin, a student in the senior class of Liaoning Provincial Experimental Middle School and the daughter of a worker, said: "In the past, the old examination system was all about putting scores first, excluding the children of workers and peasants, and exclusively creating successors for the bourgeoisie. I am the daughter of a worker, and I must be a proletarian revolutionary successor. We do not want the bourgeois score-first graduation certificate, we want to go to the university of class struggle, obtain the ideological graduation certificate issued by the worker-peasant-soldier masses, and serve the worker-peasant-soldier masses for a lifetime." Wu Darong, a graduating high school student from Chengdu Northwest Middle School and the son of a worker, said: Some bourgeois teachers say that we worker children are "stupid" and are unwilling to teach us. Only the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have spoken the minds of our proletarian children. We must express the anger of the proletariat, study for the revolution, and be good revolutionary successors. Zeng Yuanzhang, a student at the Wuhan Dongxihu Industrial-Agricultural Technical School, burst into tears after seeing the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, saying: The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are of one heart with us poor and lower-middle peasants. The bourgeois "masters" did everything possible to prevent our children of poor and lower-middle peasants from entering school. Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are leading us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It's truly a moment of great pride!

    In letters and telegrams, the broad masses of revolutionary students and teachers solemnly expressed to the Party and Chairman Mao that they must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, forever follow Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, vow to be proletarian revolutionary successors, and struggle for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution for the rest of their lives. In a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary students in Shanghai said: The Party and Chairman Mao place their hopes on our generation, and imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries also place their "hopes" on our generation. We are truly a crucial generation for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shatter all kinds of spiritual shackles imposed on our generation, take over the torch of the proletarian revolution, pass it on, and pass it on from generation to generation. All the students of Senior Three at Guangzhou Zhixin Girls' Middle School had written to Premier Zhou not long ago, requesting the abolition of the current higher education enrollment examination methods, so that they could devote all their strength to the in-depth Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the school, resolutely overthrow all the monsters and demons; let them go directly to the three great revolutionary movements, to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to temper and transform themselves. When they learned that their wishes had been realized, they cheered and said: How concerned the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are about our young generation, and how supportive they are of our participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We are truly proud to have such a great party and a great leader. We will never betray the earnest expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, resolutely break with all old education systems, and never leave school until complete victory. Students from the Senior Three class of Tianjin Nankai Middle School said that the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council demonstrates the determination of the people of the whole country to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must study Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and strike wherever the Party and Chairman Mao point.

    Many parents of students in various places also warmly support this decision. An old worker in Chengdu said: The struggle between the bourgeoisie and us for the next generation is very fierce. We will never let the school lead our children onto the path of becoming bourgeois experts, causing our proletarian dictatorship to change color. We must ensure that our next generation truly becomes revolutionary successors of the proletariat. Wang Fuchen, a cook at Shenyang Medical College, said happily: I didn't study for a day in the old society. Today, I have five children in school, and one of them is graduating from high school this year. I am extremely grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for the training and education of young people. The Party Central Committee and the State Council's decision to reform the education system is so correct, I firmly support it. In order to thoroughly carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and eradicate the roots of revisionism, I am at ease with whatever the Party tells my children to do, whether it's going to the countryside or the factory to work, because only in this way can young people be cultivated into revolutionary successors of the proletariat. Yuan Hualin, a Senior Three student at Liaoning Experimental Middle School, had just finished listening to the broadcast when she received a long-distance call from her parents in Fushun, instructing her to resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, make revolution for a lifetime under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and study the four volumes of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* that her parents gave her well, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

    Many middle school students and teachers in these major cities also had heated discussions on the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and the revolutionary initiatives of the Beijing students, and put forward new suggestions such as better studying Chairman Mao's works and breaking down the old education system and establishing a proletarian education system. The broad masses of students and teachers enthusiastically demanded that Chairman Mao's works be made a compulsory course. Revolutionary students and teachers in Shenyang City suggested: Thoroughly reform the old teaching materials and use the experiences and articles written by the worker-peasant-soldier masses in studying Chairman Mao's works as important teaching materials. School teachers must also first obtain "ideological qualification certificates" issued by the working class, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants.

    上海天津武汉广州成都沈阳西安革命师生和家长
    坚决拥护改革高等学校招考制度
    广大革命学生说，我们要到三大革命运动中去考试，我们的考堂在工厂和农村，我们要到工农中去领“思想毕业证书”，活学活用毛主席著作是我们考试的最重要内容。
    新华社十八日讯　上海、天津、武汉、广州、成都、沈阳、西安等大城市广大革命学生和革命教师坚决拥护党中央和国务院改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定，热烈赞同北京女一中高三（四）班和北京四中高三（五）班学生给党中央和毛主席的两封信中提出的革命倡议。广大革命学生和教师表示：党中央和毛主席这个英明、伟大的决定，具有伟大的历史意义，是对统治了几千年的剥削阶级旧教育思想和旧教育制度的沉重打击，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一新的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    当昨晚广播电台播出这个振奋人心的消息后，广大革命学生和教师欢腾雀跃，振臂高呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！这些城市的革命学生和教师们敲锣打鼓，欢唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，热情地写大字报、喜报，给党中央和毛主席写决心书和发致敬电。在上海，消息播出以后，很短时间内就有几百名应届的高中毕业生聚集在《解放日报》门前，送来给党中央和毛主席的信。成都的许多学生，深夜集会，冒雨游行，表示衷心拥护这一决定的无限感激的心情。武汉市五十多个中学的学生代表今天上午兴高采烈地在共青团武汉市委举行集会。“毛主席万岁！”、“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”的欢呼声响彻会场。
    广大革命学生和教师愤怒控诉旧教育制度的危害，坚决表示一定要把这场彻底改革旧教育制度的史无前例的大革命进行到底。上海市北中学应届高中毕业生激动地说：旧的招生考试制度害死人！它是为资产阶级阴谋复辟服务的，是为资产阶级培养接班人的，我们要在党中央和毛主席的领导下，彻底闹革命。高三
  （四）班的一个学生说：我们要到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中去考试。我们的考堂在工厂、在农村；活学活用毛主席著作是我们考试的最重要内容。上海第二女子中学和其他很多学校的学生和教师说：我们早就盼望改革高等学校的招生考试办法。现在，北京市第一女中和第四中学的同学讲出了我们的心里话，党中央和毛主席及时作出英明、正确的决定。我们一定要在党中央和毛主席的领导下，坚决粉碎反动的杀人不见血的资产阶级的教育制度，打破一切资产阶级代表人物和资产阶级“权威”、“专家”的阻挠，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，创建无产阶级的革命的教育事业和教育制度。辽宁省实验中学的一千多名师生听了广播后，一片欢腾。这个学校的毕业班在打给党中央和毛主席的电报中说：“亲爱的党，敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中的红太阳！您的英明决定，把我们从旧教育制度中解放出来了！”早在六月六日，这个学校的高三（三）班学生就给党中央和毛主席写了信，表示坚决砸碎旧的教育制度，彻底闹革命，不搞好这次无产阶级文化大革命决不离开学校。
    西北大学数学系二年级学生姬春胜以切身的经历，揭露了旧招生考试制度的危害。两年前他考大学时为了追求分数，拼命钻书本，而放松了思想改造。因此进大学以后资产阶级个人主义思想有所滋长，大大影响了自己的进步。姬春胜说，旧教育制度害了我。他表示衷心拥护党中央、国务院改革招生考试制度的重大决定。他说：今后一定要认真学习毛主席著作，同工农结合，走革命化道路。不仅中学生要到工农中去领思想毕业证书，我们大学生也要到工农中去领思想毕业证书。
    党中央和国务院的这个决定特别受到广大工人、贫农下中农子女的热烈欢呼。成都第四中学高三年级贫农子弟学生冯永树说：“党中央和国务院这个决定，充分说明了对我们当好革命接班人的信任和希望。”冯永树说，他在小学读书时，班上有不少贫农下中农子弟。他进初中后，班上只有几个同学是贫农下中农子弟了。到了高中，全班只有他一人是贫农下中农子弟。
    他说：“原来的教育制度，是无论如何也培养不出革命接班人的。它限制了我们贫农下中农子弟入学的机会，是加在我们青年一代身上的枷锁，非彻底革掉不可！”辽宁省实验中学高三班学生、工人的女儿李亚琴说：“过去旧的考试制度就是分数挂帅，就是排斥工农子弟，专为资产阶级造就接班人。我是工人的女儿，一定要做无产阶级革命接班人。我们不要资产阶级分数第一的毕业证书，我们要到阶级斗争的大学里去，取得工农兵群众发给的思想毕业证书，为工农兵群众服务一辈子。”成都市西北中学高中应届毕业生、工人子弟吴大容说：有些资产阶级教师说我们工人子弟“脑子笨”，不愿意教我们，只有党中央、毛主席说出了我们无产阶级子弟的心里话，我们一定要发无产阶级之愤，为革命而学习，当好革命接班人。武汉市东西湖工读技校学生曾元章看到党中央和国务院的决定后，热泪盈眶地说：党中央、毛主席和我们贫农下中农心连心。资产阶级“老爷”们百般阻挠我们贫农下中农子女升学，今天党中央和毛主席领导我们搞无产阶级文化大革命，真是扬眉吐气！
    广大革命学生和教师在信件和电报中向党和毛主席庄严表示，一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远跟着毛主席，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，誓做无产阶级革命接班人，为中国革命和世界革命奋斗终生。上海广大革命学生在写给党中央和毛主席的信中说：党和毛主席把希望寄托在我们这一代，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派也把“希望”寄托在我们这一代。我们真是中国革命和世界革命的关键的一代。我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打碎一切强加在我们这一代身上的各种精神枷锁，把无产阶级革命的火炬接过来，传下去，一代一代地传下去。广州市执信女子中学高三级全体学生不久以前曾写信给周总理，要求废止现行的高等学校招生考试办法，让她们把全部力量投入学校深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命中去，坚决把一切牛鬼蛇神斗垮；让她们直接到三大革命运动中去、到工农兵中去锻炼和改造。当她们知道她们的愿望已经实现时，欢欣鼓舞地说：党中央和毛主席对我们青年一代是多么关怀，对我们参加无产阶级文化大革命是多么支持啊！我们真为有这样伟大的党和伟大的领袖而骄傲。我们决不辜负党和毛主席的殷切期望，坚决将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决和一切旧教育制度决裂，不获全胜，决不离校。天津南开中学高三班的同学们表示，党中央和国务院的决定，表现了全国人民誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心，我们一定好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，党和毛主席指向哪里就打向哪里。
    各地许多学生家长也热烈拥护这个决定。成都一位老工人说：资产阶级同我们争夺下一代的斗争十分激烈。我们绝不让学校把我们的子女引到白专道路上去，使我们无产阶级专政的国家改变颜色，一定要使我们的下一代真正成为无产阶级革命的接班人。沈阳医学院厨师王福臣高兴地说：我在旧社会没念一天书，今天我有五个孩子都在念书，有一个孩子今年高中毕业，我万分感谢党和毛主席对青年的培养教育。党中央和国务院决定改革教育制度太正确了，我坚决拥护。为了彻底搞好无产阶级文化大革命，挖掉修正主义根子，党叫我的孩子下乡下厂劳动，干什么我都放心，因为只有这样才能把青年培养成无产阶级的革命接班人。辽宁实验中学高中三年级学生袁化临刚刚听完广播，就接到她的父母从抚顺打来的长途电话，嘱咐她坚决听党和毛主席的话，在党和毛主席领导下干一辈子革命，好好学习爸爸妈妈送给她的四卷《毛泽东选集》，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。
    这些大城市的许多中学生和教师还就党中央、国务院的决定和北京同学们的革命倡议进行了热烈的讨论，并提出了更好地学习毛主席著作和破除旧教育制度、建立无产阶级教育制度等的新建议。广大学生和教师热烈要求把毛主席著作作为必修课。沈阳市的革命学生和教师建议：彻底改革旧教材，把工农兵群众写的学习毛主席著作的心得和文章作为重要教材。学校教师也要首先取得工人阶级、贫农下中农发给的“思想合格证书”。
