    In the second half of 1965, Kuang Yaming, in his capacity as president, came to our class to "squat," wanting our class to study Chairman Mao's writings, and even lectured us himself. Was he really there to guide us in studying Chairman Mao's works well? No! Under the guise of studying Chairman Mao's works, he was engaging in counter-revolutionary activities that thoroughly opposed Mao Zedong Thought.

    We clearly remember that when Kuang Yaming first lectured us, he saw a slogan on the wall of our classroom: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." He shook his head and said: "This is the most elementary and simplest method of learning." Later, he also told us: "When studying Chairman Mao's works, it is not necessary to connect it with your own ideological reality. If you can connect it, connect it; if you can't connect it, don't force it." Look! How viciously the anti-Party element Kuang Yaming attacked Mao Zedong Thought, and how dangerous a path he wanted to lead us down. We felt incredibly angry!

    Kuang Yaming also often told us that when studying Chairman Mao's works, we should focus on learning Chairman Mao's rhetoric, logic, language, and style, and not talk about learning Chairman Mao's standpoint, viewpoint, and method of observing and analyzing problems. Every time he lectured, he would call logic, writing, and philosophy teachers to help him analyze the writing methods, rhetorical methods, and logical structure of Chairman Mao's articles, and so on. He even made tedious textual research on individual words in Chairman Mao's articles. In Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," there is the phrase "提挈全军" (tí qiè quán jūn - "to lift up the entire army"). In order to explain the word "提挈" (tí qiè - "to lift"), he even asked people to look up the *辞海* (Cihai) on the spot, saying: "'提挈' (tí qiè) means to hold something suspended." It took more than thirty minutes just to explain this word. Kuang Yaming did this with ulterior motives. He did not guide us to study Chairman Mao's works well at all, but used extremely cunning means to lead our movement of studying Chairman Mao's works astray, thereby achieving his sinister purpose of opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

    Tell you, Kuang Yaming, your conspiracy will never succeed. Your extremely vicious slander of Mao Zedong Thought only proves the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought, which is the fundamental guarantee for our victory in revolution and construction; it also proves that our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is the right thing to do. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    敌人反对的我们就拥护
    一九六五年下半年，匡亚明以校长的名义到我班来“蹲点”，要我们班级学毛主席著作，并且亲自给我们讲课。他真的是来引导我们学好毛主席著作吗？不！他打着学习毛主席著作的幌子，干的却是彻头彻尾的反对毛泽东思想的反革命勾当。
    我们清楚地记得，当匡亚明第一次给我们讲课的时候，他看到我们教室的墙上有一条标语：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”。他摇了摇头说：“这是最低级、最简单的学习方法。”后来他又告诉我们：“学习毛主席著作，不一定联系自己的思想实际，联系得上就联系，联系不上就不要硬联系。”看！反党分子匡亚明多么恶毒地攻击毛泽东思想，他要把我们引导到多么危险的道路上去。我们感到无比愤怒！
    匡亚明还经常对我们说，学习毛主席著作，要好好学习毛主席著作的修辞、逻辑、语言和文风，根本不谈学习毛主席观察、分析问题的立场、观点和方法。他每次讲课，都要叫讲逻辑的、写作的、哲学的老师一起来，帮助他分析毛主席文章的写作方法、修辞方法、逻辑结构，等等。他甚至对毛主席文章中的个别词汇作烦琐的考证。在毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》中有“提挈全军”一词。他为了解释“提挈”这个词，竟当场叫人去翻《辞海》，说：“‘提挈’者，悬而持之也。”为解释这个词，前后竟花了三十多分钟。匡亚明这样做，是别有用心的。他根本不引导我们学好毛主席著作，而是用极其狡猾的手段，把我们学习毛主席著作的运动引入歧途，从而达到他反对毛泽东思想的阴险目的。
    告诉你，匡亚明，你的阴谋永远不会得逞。你这样极端恶毒地污蔑毛泽东思想，正好说明毛泽东思想有着无穷的威力，它是我们革命和建设取得胜利的根本保证；也正好说明我们活学活用毛主席著作是做对了。我们就是要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
