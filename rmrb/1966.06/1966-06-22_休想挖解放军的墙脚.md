    Don't Even Think About Undermining the PLA

    During the Liberation War, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our army transformed from a position of inferiority to one of superiority, dealing a fatal blow to Chiang Kai-shek's army with tremendous speed. Under the pressure of our army's powerful military encirclement and political superiority, entire regiments and brigades of the Kuomintang army were annihilated and disintegrated. Morale was low, soldiers feared and hated war, and they were routed. However, the director and screenwriter of "Against the Wind a Thousand Miles" depicted a group of captured Chiang bandits as spirited, confident, and arrogant "heroes." They could revolt whenever they wanted; refuse to leave when they didn't want to; escape whenever they pleased; smash bowls whenever they felt like it; and manipulate our soldiers at will. How can anyone believe that these were the Chiang bandit troops who were utterly defeated and routed by us?

    Our army was founded by Chairman Mao, and our soldiers are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We have always acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's military-building ideology and have thus been able to defeat all reactionaries, both domestic and foreign. In the struggle, our People's Army demonstrated the revolutionary heroic spirit of despising all enemies and overwhelming all enemies. Our veteran squad leader Huang Jiguang, in the Battle of Shangganling in Korea, after continuously blowing up several enemy bunkers, despite sustaining seven severe injuries, his left chest pierced and both legs blown off, in order to open a path for the follow-up troops and for the victory of the entire battle, he gritted his teeth, endured the excruciating pain, crawled to the enemy bunker, leaped up, and used his chest to block the enemy machine gun port that was firing madly, sacrificing heroically. He fully demonstrated the fearless revolutionary heroism of being courageous, tenacious, and unafraid of sacrifice.

    The director and screenwriter of "Against the Wind a Thousand Miles" portrayed the heroic People's Liberation Army as weak and incompetent cowards, while the Kuomintang Chiang bandit troops who were disarmed by us were portrayed as courageous and tenacious "heroes." This is an outright lie, deliberately creating a biography for class enemies, racking their brains to put gold on the faces of enemies, and is a great distortion of our army. We are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we clearly know that overwhelming all enemies is our army's fighting tradition; being courageous, tenacious, and unafraid of sacrifice is the true color of our revolutionary soldiers. Comrade Huang Jiguang is our shining example. We sternly warn the film's director and screenwriter: Do you want to undermine the PLA and slander the great People's Liberation Army? That is daydreaming and wishful thinking.

    休想挖解放军的墙脚
    解放战争时期，我军在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，由劣势变优势，以一日千里之势，给蒋介石的军队以致命打击。在我军强大军事包围和政治优势的压力下，国民党军队整团整旅被歼灭、被瓦解，士气低落，怕战厌战，溃不成军。可是《逆风千里》的编导者却把一群被俘的蒋匪军描绘成神气十足，充满信心，不可一世的“英雄”。他们想造反就造反；想不走就不走；想逃就逃；想摔碗就摔碗；想摆布我们的战士就任意摆布，这怎么叫人相信，他们是被我们打得落花流水、溃不成军的蒋匪军呢？
    我们的军队是毛主席一手缔造的军队，我们的战士是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。我们一直是按照毛主席的建军思想行事的，因而能打败国内外一切反动派。在斗争中，我们人民军队表现了藐视一切敌人，压倒一切敌人的革命英雄气概。我们的老班长黄继光在朝鲜上甘岭战斗中，连续炸掉敌人几个地堡之后，虽然身负七处重伤，左胸被打穿，双腿被炸断，可是为了给后续部队开辟道路，为了整个战斗的胜利，他咬紧牙关，忍着剧痛，爬到敌人地堡前，纵身跃起，用自己的胸膛堵住了正在疯狂发射的敌机枪射孔，壮烈牺牲，他充分地表现了英勇顽强，不怕牺牲的大无畏革命英雄主义气概。
    《逆风千里》的编导者，把英勇的人民解放军写成软弱无能的懦夫，被我们缴了械的国民党蒋匪军则是英勇顽强的“英雄”。这是彻头彻尾的撒谎，是别有用心的在给阶级敌人立传，是挖空心思往敌人脸上贴金，这是对我军的极大歪曲。我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，我们清楚地知道：压倒一切敌人是我军的战斗传统；英勇顽强，不怕牺牲是我们革命战士的本色。黄继光同志就是我们的光辉榜样。我们严厉警告电影的编导：你们想挖解放军的墙脚，想污蔑伟大的人民解放军吗？那是白天做梦，痴心妄想。
