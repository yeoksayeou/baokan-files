Title: A New Conspiracy

    Under the orchestration of the United States, the South Vietnamese puppet regime recently "invited" the United Nations to send "observers" to "observe" the sham "elections" to be held in September. This is a new conspiracy being played by U.S. imperialism.
    The sinister intentions of U.S. imperialism in playing this conspiracy are obvious. On the one hand, it wants to steal the name of the United Nations, to put a "legal" cloak on the South Vietnamese pseudo-election concocted by the U.S. government, so as to deceive the South Vietnamese people, quell the infighting among the puppet groups, and deceive world opinion. On the other hand, and more importantly, it is to open a path for the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue, so that the United Nations can further serve the U.S. aggressive policy.
    The Vietnam issue has nothing to do with the United Nations. Despite this, for a long time, the United States has tried every means to forcibly link the United Nations with the Vietnam issue. Since last year, the Johnson administration has repeatedly attempted to use the United Nations to help it carry out its "peace" swindle and war blackmail. This time, after the South Vietnamese puppets put forward the request for the United Nations to send "observers", the Johnson administration immediately expressed anxiously: The United States advocates "sending a United Nations peacekeeping force to Vietnam." This is truly the crowning touch. It nakedly exposes the U.S. imperialists' delusion to raise the banner of the United Nations and let more servants and accomplices take chestnuts out of the fire for it.
    The Johnson administration's clinging so tightly to the United Nations signboard reflects its extremely difficult situation in South Vietnam. However, the United Nations is merely a tool in the hands of the United States, and the United Nations itself is not having an easy time. No matter how painstakingly U.S. imperialism plots, the signboard of the United Nations cannot hide the aggressive face of the United States, nor can it save its military defeat and political bankruptcy in South Vietnam.

    一个新阴谋
    在美国策划下，南越傀儡政权最近“邀请”联合国派出“观察员”，去“观察”将在九月间举行的伪“选举”。这是美帝国主义玩弄的一个新阴谋。
    美帝国主义玩弄这个阴谋的险恶用心是显而易见的。一方面，它想盗用联合国的名义，使美国政府一手炮制的南越伪选举，披上一件“合法”外衣，借以欺骗南越人民，平息傀儡集团间的内讧，并蒙蔽世界舆论。另一方面，更重要的，是要打开一条联合国插手越南问题的门路，使联合国进一步为美国侵略政策服务。
    越南问题同联合国毫无关系。尽管如此，长时期来，美国却千方百计硬要把联合国同越南问题联起来。去年以来，约翰逊政府就几次三番地企图利用联合国帮助它推行“和平”骗局和战争讹诈。这一次，南越傀儡提出联合国派“观察员”的要求后，约翰逊政府立即情急地表示：美国主张“由联合国派一支和平部队到越南”。这真是画龙点睛之笔。它赤裸裸暴露了美帝国主义妄想打起联合国的旗号，让更多的仆从和帮凶为它火中取栗。
    约翰逊政府这样死死抱住联合国的招牌不放，反映了它在南越的处境十分困难。但是，联合国不过是美国手中的工具，联合国自己的日子也不好过。不管美帝国主义怎样挖空心思，联合国的招牌既不能掩盖美国的侵略面目，也不能挽救它在南越的军事失败和政治破产。
