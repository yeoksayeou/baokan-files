    Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: The CCP Central Committee's decision regarding the reorganization of the Beijing Municipal Committee and the decision of the new CCP Beijing Municipal Committee to reorganize the Beijing University Party Committee have been met with extremely warm support from people all over the country.
    News from Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Jinan, Guiyang, Kunming, Hohhot, Urumqi, Hefei, Changchun, Taiyuan, Nanchang, Nanning, Xining, Yinchuan, Chongqing and other places reflects that workers, peasants, cadres of organs, teachers, students and commanders and fighters of stationed troops in various places, with infinite love and trust for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have held meetings one after another, posted big-character posters, and written letters of determination, warmly cheering the wise decision of the Central Committee, angrily denouncing the towering crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Committee gang of revisionist elements who opposed the Party and socialism, and expressing their determination to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    Workers from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory said at a meeting: This decision supports the laboring people and is an important guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We workers are 10,000 times in favor of it and support it with both hands. Liu Chunming, a "Five-Good" worker from the Jilin Province Asbestos Products Factory, said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the revolution and the red sun in our hearts. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our enemy, and we will resolutely defeat them. We workers cannot be separated from the Party for a moment, nor can we be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment." Dong Xiaohai, a first-class combat meritorious hero of an air force unit, said: "The Party Central Committee's decision is very wise and timely. This proves that our socialist country is indestructible and cannot be overthrown by any enemy." He Lianshi and others from the Kunming Traffic Department Automotive Technician School, after hearing the news, immediately composed a song called "Cultural Revolution Spreads Good News" with excitement. The song sings: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines, 600 million people shake their iron arms, the painted skin of 'authorities' is torn off, demons and monsters are overthrown, the Beijing Municipal Committee has been reorganized, revisionism has collapsed, workers, peasants, and soldiers cheer with raised arms, the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shines boundlessly!" A group of employees from the Hardware Company of the Yuhang County Commercial Bureau in the suburbs of Hangzhou jointly wrote a long letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and publicly recommended Comrade Han Xiang, a demobilized PLA soldier, to ride a bicycle for more than 50 li from Linping Town at 2:00 AM the next morning to Hangzhou, requesting news organizations to send it to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the fastest way possible. In the letter, they said: "When all the comrades in our company heard the news of the reorganization of the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Beijing University Party Committee, they unanimously believed that this was a great new victory for our country's socialist revolution, which made us extremely excited and excited. We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for the rest of our lives, follow Chairman Mao for the rest of our lives, fight with class enemies for the rest of our lives, and defeat any demons and monsters." Beijing educated youths participating in construction in Ningxia unanimously stated: We grew up in Beijing. Beijing is the center of world revolution and the red capital. The leadership of Beijing must never be usurped by revisionists! We support the decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Committee a thousand times, ten thousand times!
    The masses in various places generally pointed out that the evil facts of the former Beijing Municipal Committee gang of counter-revolutionary black gangs who were opposing the red flag under the guise of the "red flag" show that if the proletariat wants to maintain and consolidate its own regime, it must not relax its efforts to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat for a moment. Li Shunda, captain of the Xigou Brigade in Pingshun County, Shanxi, Shen Jilan, deputy captain, Guo Yu'en, captain of the Chuandi Brigade, and Wang Changfu, director of the Poor Peasants Association of the Wule Brigade, said in an article jointly written for the newspaper that some bourgeois masters of the former Beijing Municipal Committee openly clamored for our Party to step down, and they wanted to exercise dictatorship over us. We have already ferreted out these foxes and dogs with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said that if the enemy takes up a knife, we must also take up a knife. For these bad guys who have deep-seated hatred for the proletariat, we must exercise dictatorship over them again and again, be "overbearing" again and again, and never give them freedom, and never talk to them about equality. Commanders and fighters of the Kunming troops said at the forum that this group of revisionist elements, relying on the powers they usurped, had long been in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and the line of the Party Central Committee, and they were the general root of all kinds of anti-Party and anti-socialist black lines. Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have removed them from their posts and dismissed them from their offices, and we cheer: Removed well! Dismissed well! Through this struggle, we have become even more aware that we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to highlight politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    "Pursue the tottering foe", people emphasized in many meetings that although the struggle against the former Beijing Municipal Committee's small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements has achieved a decisive victory, it must not be relaxed. We must hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, make persistent efforts, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, sweep away all demons and monsters. Manduhu, a Mongolian worker at the Inner Mongolia Printing Factory, said that ferreting out the anti-Party black gang of the former Beijing Municipal Committee is a major victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must further read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, brighten our eyes, clear our minds, and overthrow all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Employees of the No. 3 State Cotton Mill in Henan stated that in this struggle, we must closely unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, resolutely fight against all the anti-Party black gangs of the "Three-Family Village", and never stop fighting until a complete victory is won.
    Some party and government leading organs in Beijing and across the country have also held cadre meetings for days, unanimously supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Committee, and expressing that they will further mobilize, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely push the proletarian cultural revolution movement in their regions and departments forward in victory.

    中共中央改组北京市委的决定受到全国极热烈拥护
    工农兵振臂欢呼　毛泽东思想光芒万丈
    新华社五日讯　中共中央关于改组北京市委的决定和中共北京新市委改组北京大学党委的决定，受到全国各地人民极其热烈的拥护。
    来自武汉、郑州、兰州、杭州、福州、济南、贵阳、昆明、呼和浩特、乌鲁木齐、合肥、长春、太原、南昌、南宁、西宁、银川、重庆等地的消息反映，各地工人、农民、机关干部、学校师生和驻军指战员等怀着对党中央、毛主席的无限敬爱和信赖的心情，纷纷集会，贴出大字报，写下决心书，热烈欢呼中央的英明决定，愤怒声讨前北京市委一伙修正主义分子反党反社会主义的滔天罪行，表示决心要在党中央、毛主席领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    武汉重型机床厂的工人们在集会上说：这一决定给劳动人民撑了腰，它是巩固无产阶级专政的重要保证，我们工人万分赞成，高举双手拥护。吉林省石棉制品厂五好工人刘春明说：“毛泽东思想是革命的命根子，是我们心中的红太阳，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的敌人，我们就要坚决把他们打垮，我们工人阶级一刻也离不开党，一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。”空军某部一等战斗功臣董小海说：“党中央这一决定非常英明、及时。这证明我们的社会主义江山是铁打的，是任何敌人也颠覆不了的。”云南省交通厅汽车技工学校干部何联使等人在听到消息后，怀着激动的心情，立即谱写了一首《文化革命传捷报》的歌曲，歌中唱道：“毛泽东思想光辉照，六亿人民铁臂摇，‘权威’的画皮被撕破，牛鬼蛇神被打倒，北京市委已改组，修正主义垮台了，工农兵振臂齐欢呼，毛泽东思想光芒万丈高！”杭州市郊区余杭县商业局五金公司的一群职工，一起给党中央和毛主席写了一封长信，公推一位业已转业的解放军战士韩湘同志在第二天的清晨二时从临平镇骑自行车走了五十多里路赶到杭州，要求新闻单位用最迅速的方法送交党中央和毛主席。他们在信上说：“我们全公司的同志听到了改组北京市委和北京大学党委的消息，一致认为这是我国社会主义革命的一个伟大的新胜利，使我们无比激动，无比兴奋。我们坚决一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子跟毛主席走，一辈子和阶级敌人斗争，战胜任何牛鬼蛇神。”在宁夏参加建设的北京知识青年一致表示：我们是在北京长大的，北京是世界革命的中心，是红色的首都，北京市的领导权决不让修正主义者篡夺！党中央改组北京市委的决定我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    各地群众普遍指出，前北京市委一伙反革命黑帮打着“红旗”反红旗的罪恶事实说明，无产阶级要保持和巩固自己的政权，就一刻也不能放松加强无产阶级专政。山西平顺县西沟大队大队长李顺达、副大队长申纪兰，川底大队大队长郭玉恩，吾乐大队贫协主任王长富在给报社合写的一篇文章中说，前北京市委的一些资产阶级老爷们，公然叫嚣要我们党下台，他们要专我们的政。我们凭着战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经揪出了这些狐群狗党。毛主席说，敌人拿刀，我们也要拿刀。对于这些对无产阶级怀着刻骨仇恨的坏家伙，我们必须对他们专政再专政，“霸道”再“霸道”，决不能让他们有自由，决不能跟他们讲平等。昆明部队指战员在座谈会上说，这伙修正主义分子凭借着被他们篡夺了的职权，长期与毛泽东思想、党中央的路线相对抗，他们是形形色色反党反社会主义黑线的总根子。今天，党中央和毛主席撤掉他们的职，罢掉他们的官，我们欢呼：撤得好！罢得好！通过这场斗争，使我们更加认识到，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，人们在许多集会上都强调指出，对前北京市委一小撮反党反社会主义分子的斗争，虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是绝不能松懈，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，再接再厉，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。内蒙古印刷厂蒙古族工人满都呼说，揪出前北京市委反党黑帮，是无产阶级文化大革命的重大战果。我们一定要进一步读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，擦亮眼睛，清醒头脑，把一切反党反社会主义分子统统打倒。河南国棉三厂的职工表示，在这场斗争中，要紧紧地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，坚决和一切“三家村”的反党黑帮进行斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    北京和全国各地的一些党政领导机关，也连日纷纷举行干部大会，一致拥护党中央改组北京市委的决定，并表示要进一步动员起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把本地区本部门的无产阶级文化革命运动乘胜推向前进。
