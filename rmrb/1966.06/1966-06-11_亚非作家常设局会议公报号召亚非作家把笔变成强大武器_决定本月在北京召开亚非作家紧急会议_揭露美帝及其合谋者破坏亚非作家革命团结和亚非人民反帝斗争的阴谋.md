　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th June: Communique of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting
　　(Beijing, June 10, 1966)
　　The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau held a meeting in Beijing from June 9 to 10, 1966, to discuss the preparations for the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers to be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966. Representatives from Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan participated in the meeting. The meeting heard and discussed reports from the Secretary-General's representative and the host country, China, regarding the preparations for the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers. All participating member state representatives unanimously expressed satisfaction with the preparations that had been completed.
　　The meeting noted with pleasure that the decision to hold the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing, made by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau after full consultation with all member states, has received enthusiastic response and active support from Afro-Asian writers. To date, writers from more than forty Afro-Asian countries and regions have accepted the Permanent Bureau's invitation and decided to send representatives to participate in the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers to be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966.
　　The meeting unanimously reaffirmed the following agenda for the upcoming Emergency Meeting:
　　(1) Supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialist aggression, to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the Fatherland.
　　(2) The tasks undertaken by writers in the struggle of the Afro-Asian peoples against imperialism headed by the United States, for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence.
　　(3) Opposing the cultural aggression of imperialism and old and new colonialism, and developing the national cultures of the Afro-Asian peoples.
　　The meeting exposed that pseudo-revolutionaries colluding with US imperialism have been actively engaged in conspiracies to sabotage the Emergency Meeting, undermine the great cause of anti-imperialist revolutionary unity of Afro-Asian writers, betray the interests of the struggle of Afro-Asian peoples, and serve imperialism and reactionary forces. The meeting unanimously and severely condemned such activities that undermine the revolutionary interests of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, and fully endorsed the correct steps already taken by the Secretary-General to counter such divisive and destructive activities. At the same time, it pointed out that in the face of the powerful Afro-Asian writers' movement, such destructive activities are doomed to utter failure.
　　The meeting called on all anti-imperialist revolutionary Afro-Asian peoples and Afro-Asian writers to heighten their vigilance, unite firmly, smash all sabotage conspiracies, and contribute to the success of the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers.
　　At a time when the Vietnamese people are engaged in a heroic anti-US national salvation struggle, and the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America and all countries around the world are fighting for national liberation and independence, the meeting called on Afro-Asian writers to unreservedly support the upcoming Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers at this important and urgent moment, to turn their pens into powerful weapons, and to fight alongside the Afro-Asian peoples against and overthrow their common enemy—imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs and apologists.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th June: The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting concluded in Beijing today.
　　At today's meeting, representatives from various countries listened to a summary of the main points of the Secretary-General's report that Secretary-General Senanayake would make to the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers, presented by the representative of the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and Chairman of this session of the Permanent Bureau Meeting, Manuwila.
　　The representatives discussed and unanimously adopted the "Communique of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting." The communique pointed out that "the decision to hold the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing, made by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau after full consultation with all member states, has received enthusiastic response and active support from Afro-Asian writers. To date, writers from more than forty Afro-Asian countries and regions have accepted the Permanent Bureau's invitation and decided to send representatives to participate in the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers to be held in Beijing from June 27 to July 6, 1966."
　　The communique said, "The meeting exposed that pseudo-revolutionaries colluding with US imperialism have been actively engaged in conspiracies to sabotage the Emergency Meeting, undermine the great cause of anti-imperialist revolutionary unity of Afro-Asian writers, betray the interests of the struggle of Afro-Asian peoples, and serve imperialism and reactionary forces. The meeting unanimously and severely condemned such activities that undermine the revolutionary interests of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, and fully endorsed the correct steps already taken by the Secretary-General to counter such divisive and destructive activities." The communique said, "The meeting called on all anti-imperialist revolutionary Afro-Asian peoples and Afro-Asian writers to heighten their vigilance, unite firmly, smash all sabotage conspiracies, and contribute to the success of the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers."
　　The meeting also unanimously adopted a telegram to Secretary-General Sibai of the Writers' Association of the United Arab Republic. The telegram reiterated the decision to convene the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing on June 27, and earnestly looked forward to Sibai's participation.
　　Manuwila delivered a speech at the close of the meeting. He pointed out that the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting was a great success. We have a common stance and issued a communique on a common basis. This shows that the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers will be a very successful meeting. No force can stop the progress of our meeting, and no one can undermine it.
　　He said that Afro-Asian revolutionary writers have always and will continue to stand with the peoples of Asia and Africa who are engaged in revolutionary struggles. At the upcoming Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers, Afro-Asian revolutionary writers will make their own contribution to the struggle of the world's peoples. Afro-Asian writers are sworn to be the strong backing of the heroic Vietnamese people, and to fight alongside them until final victory is won.
　　Manuwila announced the successful conclusion of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting amidst warm applause.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th June: The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Meeting sent a telegram today to Secretary-General Sibai of the Writers' Association of the United Arab Republic, reiterating the decision to hold the Emergency Meeting of Afro-Asian Writers in Beijing on June 27, and expressing the expectation of his participation.
