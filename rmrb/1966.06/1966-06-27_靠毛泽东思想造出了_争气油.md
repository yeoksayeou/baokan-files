Our Chinese-style urea dewaxing device, born in the Great Leap Forward era, has contributed to the construction of our socialist motherland. The high-grade oil products it produces have shattered the blockade imposed by imperialism and revisionism, and have broken through the obstacles set by bourgeois technical "authorities." When comrades talk about this, they are all excited. Why? Because in this struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and bourgeois technical "authorities," we have used Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all ghosts and monsters. This is the product of our active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the product of the Great Leap Forward, and also the product of our struggle for the Party, for the working class, and for the people of the entire nation. Our oil products are "Spirit Oil"!

We Must Fight for the Party and the Country

Our country needs a type of low-freezing-point special lubricating oil. In the past, this oil was purchased from the Soviet Union. In 1959, the Khrushchev revisionists betrayed their promises and used this lubricating oil as a "trump card" to block us, refusing to sell it to us.

The higher-ups informed us of this situation. This infuriated us! The workers said: The American imperialists are blockading us, and the revisionists are also blockading us. The revisionists and the American imperialists are in cahoots! The American imperialists will not be able to blockade us, and neither will the revisionists!

The higher-ups called on the phone, and the users called on the phone: Since they won't give it to us, you must fight for it and produce your own oil!

Yes! We must fight for it and produce our own oil. The Chinese working class, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is full of spirit. Whatever the foreigners have, we must have, and whatever the foreigners do not have, we must also have!

The needs of the state are our responsibility.

We were indignant and began this battle to shatter the blockade imposed by imperialism and revisionism.

Following the Direction Indicated by Chairman Mao

From a technical perspective, to produce low-freezing-point special lubricating oil, the key is to remove the wax from the oil. The less wax there is, the lower the freezing point.

At that time, we had none of the specialized personnel. (Ninety percent of our workers were new workers, some of whom were just transferred from the army, and some were just out of school.) We had no complete sets of equipment. We had no technical experience. In short, we faced a mountain of difficulties. At this time, the Party organized us to study the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creativity of all the military and civilian people."

Chairman Mao's words pointed the way for us. Everyone said: If they can do it, we can do it too. Self-reliance, daring to pioneer and daring to work hard, will open up a path. Everyone said: To fight against imperialism and revisionism, we will risk our lives to produce this oil!

The production method was determined: using urea to react with petroleum to remove wax. This method is called urea dewaxing. At that time, only a few countries were using this method, and we had no way to learn from them. The problem was clear: we had to pioneer on our own!

With Mao Zedong Thought, No Difficulty Is Insurmountable

The road must be paved by ourselves.

Foreigners are experimenting, and we must experiment too, to see who gets there first.

We built our own set of equipment and began experimenting.

The first few experiments all failed, and at this point, some people said: "With such shabby equipment, I don't believe we can produce special lubricating oil," "It seems we still have to ask them."

But the vast majority of workers had a different opinion:

"Only a few experiments have failed, what's the big deal?"
"We cannot follow in their footsteps, we must forge our own path!"

Everyone sat down to study the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades must see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our spirits." Chairman Mao's words were like a torch, illuminating our eyes. Everyone said: Right, our previous experiments, although unsuccessful, have trained us, increased our knowledge, and let us feel the "tiger's" tail. This is our great achievement.

Chairman Mao also said: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." Everyone said: To produce new products, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and practice and pioneer!

Under the Radiant Light of Mao Zedong Thought, New Oil Products Were Born

We summarized the experiences and lessons from the previous two experiments and felt that using a large reactor was both wasteful of materials and time-consuming. The workers went to the warehouse to get seventy-two small iron buckets as reactors. At the same time, we used different types of petroleum and dozens of formulations for various experiments. Dozens of people worked together, experimenting from all directions, determined to forge a path.

Some self-proclaimed "experts" saw this scene and asked: "What kind of science is this?" "This is simply a joke!" One person even brought a book in a foreign language to the site, pointing to the book and saying: "Look, is this how you do it?"

We were both angry and amused.

Indeed, this kind of mass scientific experimentation was unprecedented in foreign countries and in textbooks. Even in the minds of these so-called "experts," there was no such concept. They simply did not believe that the liberated working class could become the master of natural science. They also did not understand what science is. Why is the primitive method not scientific? Wasn't the first oil refinery furnace in the world like this? Wasn't the earliest tool used by humans a stone tool? If there had been no first oil refinery furnace, how could it have developed into today's furnace? These self-proclaimed "experts" actually lacked even the most basic knowledge, and it was astonishing that they could say such things!

The more they poured cold water on us, the more enthusiastically we worked. Dozens of pairs of eyes watched the small iron buckets, and dozens of oily hands stirred continuously, from morning to night, from dark to dawn, stirring until the sticks were worn short and the bottoms of the buckets were worn through, we still stirred and stirred, without stopping. Some stirred for a whole day, and still, there was no reaction; some had a reaction, but when the samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis, they still did not meet the quality requirements.

Failure did not discourage us. We changed the formulations time and time again, adjusted the stirring time, and found ways to make progress. In those days, the hearts of dozens of people were united, and when one person produced a drop of sample, dozens of people would inquire, encourage, and support. In a word, we would not rest until we produced new oil products!

After dozens of days of battle, tens of thousands of analytical data were obtained, and the initial rules were grasped. The joy of approaching victory inspired everyone. Instead of waiting for the samples to be analyzed in the laboratory, we simply built a laboratory in the workshop. Inside and outside the workshop, there was a festive atmosphere. It was in this atmosphere, in those small iron buckets, that low-freezing-point lubricating oil was born!

Holding High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, We March Forward Bravely

The small bucket experiment was successful, and we studied the works of Chairman Mao again. Chairman Mao said: "To achieve national victory, this is only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li.... China's revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is even longer, the work is even greater, and even more arduous." Everyone said: The small bucket experiment produced oil products, which is also the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li! We still need to redouble our efforts.

To create a complete new urea dewaxing technology, we repeatedly experimented, from small buckets to large buckets, and then from large buckets to reactors, continuously practicing, summarizing, and improving. Under the leadership of the higher-level Party and government, and with the strong support of sister units, we finally pioneered a new technology for China to produce special lubricating oil.

Our production equipment has also been gradually improved with the completion of the new technology. We produce, improve, and expand while producing, making production more reasonable and economical. For example, originally, urea was lost in the reaction process, but now we have created a recovery device, which is very simple but very effective. Compared to the initial production, the product yield has increased by more than ten times, and the cost has been reduced by eighty percent. Now, urea no longer needs to be carried upstairs by hand, and oil no longer needs to be stirred by hand. The workshop is neatly arranged with equipment, emitting a steady hum.

In this battle, not only high-grade oil products were produced, filling some gaps in China's petroleum industry, but also a batch of daring and pioneering new forces were tempered. They are brave and wise, do not believe in superstitions, are not afraid of ghosts, and go wherever the Party points, do whatever the Party says, and do it well without hesitation. The workshop was named a model workshop by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and many workers became model workers.

Mao Zedong Thought has armed us, Mao Zedong Thought has helped us shatter the enemy's blockade, Mao Zedong Thought has helped us forge a new technological path. We resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward, let Deng Tou and other anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs and bourgeois "authorities" tremble before our sea of oil! We will increase the variety and quantity of products and bury all ghosts and monsters!

### 靠毛泽东思想造出了“争气油”

    靠毛泽东思想造出了“争气油”
    兰州炼油厂尿素脱蜡车间副指导员　袁泽溪
    我们中国式的尿素脱蜡装置，在大跃进的年代里诞生以来，已经为祖国社会主义建设贡献了力量，用它生产的高级油品，粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的封锁，粉碎了那些资产阶级技术“权威”的阻挡。同志们说到这事，都眉飞色舞。为什么？因为在这场同帝国主义、同修正主义、同资产阶级技术“权威”的决斗中，我们用毛泽东思想横扫了一切牛鬼蛇神。这是我们活学活用毛泽东思想的产物，是大跃进的产物，也是我们给党争气，给工人阶级、给全国人民争气的产物。我们的油品，是“争气油”！
    我们要为党为国家争这口气
    我们国家需要一种低凝固点特种润滑油。这种油，过去是向苏联买的。一九五九年，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者背信弃义，把这种润滑油当作“王牌”，来卡我们，不卖给我们了。
    上级把这个情况告诉了我们。这可把我们气炸了！工人们说：美帝国主义封锁我们，修正主义也封锁我们，修正主义和美帝国主义一个鼻孔出气！美帝国主义休想封锁住我们，修正主义也休想封锁住我们！
    上级来电话，用户来电话：人家不给我们，你们争口气，搞出自己的油来！
    对！要争一口气，要搞出自己的油来。毛泽东思想哺育下的中国工人阶级是有志气的，外国人有的，我们要有，外国人没有的，我们也要有！
    国家的需要，就是我们的责任。
    我们憋着气，开始了这场粉碎帝国主义和修正主义封锁的战斗。
    按照毛主席指示的方向自己闯
    从生产技术上来说，要生产低凝固点特种润滑油，关键是把石油里含的蜡脱掉，蜡脱得愈净，凝固点就愈低。
    在当时，我们一无专门人材。（我们百分之八、九十的工人是新工人，有的是刚从部队上转业的战士，有的是刚出学校门的学生。）二无成套完整的设备。三无技术经验。可以说是摆着一大堆困难。这个时候，党组织我们学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”
    毛主席的话，给我们指明了方向。大家说：人家能搞出来，我们也就能搞出来。自力更生，敢闯、敢干，就会打开一条路来。大家说：为了反帝、反修，我们豁出命，也要搞出这种油！
    生产方法确定了：利用尿素同石油发生反应来脱蜡。这种方法就叫尿素脱蜡。这种方法，在当时，只有少数国家在搞，我们没有办法可以借鉴。问题就是这样明摆着：要靠我们自己闯！
    有了毛泽东思想，什么困难都不在话下
    路，总是要自己来走。
    外国人在试验，我们也要试验，看谁跑到前头。
    我们自造了一套设备，开始试验。
    最初几次试验都遭到失败，这时候，有人就说：“这样破破烂烂的装置能搞出特种润滑油，我就不相信”，“看来，还得求人家。”
    而绝大多数职工却是另一种议论：
    “才试验了几次，遇到一点挫折有什么了不起？”
    “我们不能跟在人家的屁股后面爬行，我们要走我们自己的路！”
    大家坐下来学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话，象火炬一样，照亮了我们的眼睛。大家说：对，我们前几次的试验，虽然没有成功，可是练了兵，增长了许多知识，也摸了这个“老虎”屁股，这是我们很大的成绩。
    毛主席又说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”大家说：要搞出新产品，就得照毛主席的指示办事，去实践，去闯！
    在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，新油品诞生了
    我们总结了前两次的经验教训，感到用大反应器既费原料，又费时间，工人们就到仓库去领了七十二个小铁桶当反应器。同时用不同地区的石油，用几十种配方，进行各种试验。几十个人一齐动手，四面八方都有人闯，坚决要闯出一条路来。
    有些自命为“专家”的人，看到这种情景，质问道：“这叫什么科学？”“简直是在开玩笑！”有一个人还拿上一本“洋文”书来到现场，指着书说：“你们看，那里有你们这么干的？”
    我们听了又气又可笑。
    的确，这种群众性的大搞科学实验，在外国没有，在书本上也没有。就连这些所谓“专家”的头脑里，也没有这个概念。他们根本不相信解放了的工人阶级能够作自然科学的主人。他们也根本不懂得什么叫科学。土法上马为什么不科学？难道世界上第一台炼油的炉子就是今天的这个样子吗？人类最早用的工具不是石器吗？如果没有第一台炼油的炉子，又怎么能发展成今天的这个炉子？他们自命为“专家”的人，其实，连最起码的知识都没有，亏他们说得出口！
    他们越泼冷水，我们干得越欢。几十个人的眼睛盯着小铁桶，几十双油黑的手不停地搅动，从早搅到晚，从黑搅到明，搅得木棒磨短了，搅得桶底磨穿了，我们还是搅呀搅呀，搅个不停。有的搅了一整天，还不发生反应；有的发生反应了，可是把样品拿去化验，还是达不到质量要求。
    失败并没有使我们灰心。我们一次又一次地改变配方，调整搅拌时间，总想办法要搞出名堂来。在那些日子里，几十个人的心拴在一条弦上，那个人搞出一滴样品，几十个人都关心地问讯、鼓励、支持。一句话，不搞出新油品决不罢休！
    几十个战斗的日子过去了，上万个化验数据掌握了，初步的规律摸到了。临近胜利的喜悦鼓舞着大家。把样品送到化验室去化验，都等不及了，干脆在车间里建起化验室。车间里、车间外，一片欢腾。就在这欢腾气氛中，就在那些小铁桶里，低凝固点的润滑油诞生了！
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进
    小桶试验成功了，我们又学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”大家说：小桶试验拿出来了油品，也是万里长征第一步呀！还需要再接再厉。
    为了创造出完整的尿素脱蜡新工艺，我们反复试验，从小桶到大桶，又从大桶到反应器，不断实践，不断总结，不断完善，在上级党和政府的领导下，在兄弟单位的大力支援下，终于闯出了我国自己生产特种润滑油的新工艺。
    我们的生产装置，也随着新工艺的完整，而逐步完善起来。我们边生产，边提高，边扩大，并且生产更加合理、经济。比如原先尿素在反应过程中损失掉了，现在我们搞了个回收装置，简单得很，可是很起作用。和开工初期比较，产品产量增长了十几倍，成本降低了百分之八十。现在，尿素不需要人往楼上背了，油也不需要用人搅了，车间里整齐排列的设备，发出均匀的转动声。
    在这场战斗中，不仅生产出了高级油品，补上了我国石油的一些缺门，而且锻炼成长起来了一批敢闯敢干的新生力量，他们有勇有谋，不迷信，不怕鬼，党指向哪里，就奔向哪里，党叫干什么就干什么，干就干好，毫不含糊。车间被石油工业部树为五好标兵车间，许多工人成为五好工人。
    毛泽东思想武装了我们，毛泽东思想使我们粉碎了敌人的封锁，毛泽东思想使我们创出了一条技术新路，我们坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断前进，让邓拓等反党反社会主义黑帮和资产阶级“权威”们，在我们的油海面前发抖吧！我们要多多地增加品种和产量，把一切牛鬼蛇神全部埋葬！
