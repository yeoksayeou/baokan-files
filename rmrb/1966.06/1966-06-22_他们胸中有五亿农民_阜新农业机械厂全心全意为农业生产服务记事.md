    Editor's Note: The Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory is one of the national Daqing-style enterprises and an advanced unit in the agricultural machinery industry. This advanced unit grew up in the storms of class struggle and in the continuous struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology.
    When the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory began to shift from producing coal mine processing products to producing agricultural machinery, it encountered heavy obstruction and resistance from bourgeois ideology. The factory's signboard changed, but people's thinking did not. Facts educated people: "Without thoroughly criticizing bourgeois business ideology, it is impossible to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly among the workers and to sincerely serve the peasants." Later, they used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to sweep away the old ideas and old habits on the road of advancement, which paved the way for the development of the enterprise.
    The advanced deeds of the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory once again vividly illustrate that we must pay attention to the role of ideology in all our work and must use Mao Zedong Thought to take command. To bring a factory enterprise into the socialist orbit and into the orbit of the state plan, we must first bring people's thinking into the orbit of Mao Zedong Thought.
    After studying articles such as "Serve the People," the comrades of the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory had a relatively deep understanding of the importance of ideological transformation. They said well: "Without the idea of serving the peasants, there will be no products that the peasants like." "If there is no intention to serve the peasants wholeheartedly, it will be difficult to do much good for the peasant brothers even with technology." Indeed, when Mao Zedong Thought armed their minds, they changed from not wanting to be associated with "agriculture" in the past to liking to be placed with "agriculture," and they dared to think, dared to act, dared to create, and their methods became more and more numerous, their work became more and more active, and they showed their skills in the vast world of the countryside and made outstanding achievements.
    In Fuxin Mongolian Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, there is a small factory with only over two hundred people. Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of this factory, "one heart for the peasants, everything for agriculture," have made outstanding achievements in the practice of serving agricultural production and have won high praise from the peasants. This factory is the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory.
    "To serve the people, we must first serve the 500 million peasant brothers." Under the guidance of this idea, the workers of the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory are anxious about agricultural production and act according to the needs of the peasants. In recent years, they have developed more than 200 new varieties of agricultural machinery and tools, manufactured more than 24,000 pieces of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural tools, as well as more than 50 million small agricultural tools and more than 200,000 agricultural machinery parts. At the same time, they have also repaired more than 5,000 various agricultural tools. Whether it is manufacturing, repairing, or selling agricultural tools, they strive to make the products suitable, timely, of good quality, and inexpensive, and try their best to reduce the burden on the peasants. The production cost is greatly reduced every year. Because they serve agriculture well, the commune members affectionately call them their own "arsenal" and "good logistics."
    How was the idea of wholehearted service to agriculture established in the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory?
    To Serve the People, Not to Serve Profit
    Fuxin County is a windy, sandy, and arid area with vast land and a sparse population, and the farming is rough, so the yield has always been very unstable. The Fuxin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that to change the backwardness of agricultural production in Fuxin, in addition to the efforts of the county's farmers, industrial support is also needed. Therefore, in 1960, the County Committee made the decision to immediately convert the Fuxin Machinery Factory into a factory producing agricultural tools.
    In the past, the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory mainly processed products for the Fuxin Coal Mine, and it was very profitable. They called themselves a "money tree" in Fuxin County. Now, the factory is facing a major transformation, which brings a severe test to people. Most people supported the decision of the County Committee, believing that the working class should be the pioneers in supporting agriculture. Some people also believed that in this way, the factory would not make money and there would be no "profit." Some people even openly grumbled, saying that this was "smart people doing stupid things"!
    However, under the leadership of the Fuxin County Committee, the factory's Party branch, after some mobilization and persuasion, and in order to show its determination to serve agriculture, added the words "Agricultural" to the signboard at the factory gate, changing the Machinery Factory to the Agricultural Machinery Factory.
    If the signboard changes but the idea of pursuing profit does not change, the problem still cannot be solved. Not long after the factory was converted into an agricultural machinery factory, some people believed that it was profitable to produce some big things. Regardless of whether the countryside could use them or not, the first batch of work was arranged to produce some crushers, sweet potato slicers, and other agricultural machinery with large models, large output value, and high profits. The products were produced, but they were not suitable for the needs of the local rural areas, and most of the products could not be sold; some of the products that had been sold to the rural areas also became useless.
    When the first business lost money, some people shook their heads again. They said: "Making agricultural tools is a dead end. If we continue to do this, even our jobs will be lost!" Some people also brought in the processing list from the mines, promoting that "whoever has work, we will do it for them, and whoever has profit, we will do it for them," hoping that the factory would go back.
    This major reversal in thinking sobered up the factory's Party branch. They realized that without thoroughly criticizing bourgeois business ideology, it would be impossible to establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly among the workers and to sincerely serve the peasants.
    The factory leadership took out the main force to first carry out ideological work. They organized old workers to recall and compare the past and present, and carried out class education and situation education for the workers. In particular, they systematically organized the workers to study Chairman Mao's quotations on the relationship between workers and peasants and the road to China's industrialization. The factory's workers studied and discussed at the same time, and launched a resolute struggle against the wrong idea of only wanting to make money. Through this debate, everyone clearly realized that industrial support for agriculture is a major issue in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and consolidating the socialist system, and it is the most glorious duty of the working class. Many workers pointed out that "only wanting to make money and not serving the peasants is the ideology of the exploiting class." "We are the working class and must never be a 'money tree.'"
    The factory decided to take back the products that the peasants did not want, summarize the experiences and lessons, and use the facts to further educate the masses. The factory director led a group to Tamuyingzi Brigade of Jiu Miao Commune, more than 100 li away from the factory. This brigade had just bought a 510-type crusher produced by the agricultural machinery factory. The commune members worked hard for several days, burned enough steam in the locomobile, and when they hung up the pulley of the crusher, with a hiss—the steam was used up, and the crusher did not move. When the people from the factory arrived at the scene, they understood: the crusher was too big, and the locomobile could not drive it. The team cadre said to the people from the factory: "We spent more than 700 yuan to buy a pile of iron that cannot be burned or eaten!" Someone explained: "This crusher is efficient and can grind 5,000 jin of flour a day." The commune member said, "Our small temple cannot afford this great god."
    After studying Chairman Mao's works, and facing these criticisms from the peasants, the people who came down deeply realized that without the idea of serving the peasants, there would be no products that the peasants liked. They returned to the factory and told the whole factory's workers about the situation they saw during the visit, and the whole factory was shocked. People who insisted on pursuing profit also thoroughly examined their wrong ideas. The workers immediately started to reform the structure of the crusher, and the weight was reduced from more than 300 jin to more than 100 jin, the power from 14 horsepower to 6.5 horsepower, the cost was reduced to 80 yuan, and it could also be used to sift flour and make tofu. The product was improved, and it was welcomed by the peasants. All 250 crushers produced that year were sold out.
    Not "Unpromising," But Greatly Promising
    The process of the Fuxin Agricultural Machinery Factory serving agricultural production is a process of struggle between promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. Opposing the wrong idea of pursuing profit is one round of this struggle. Another round of this struggle is: is serving agricultural production "unpromising" and is it "talent wasted"?
    After the factory was converted into an agricultural machinery factory, many people believed that being able to serve the majority of peasant brothers was their greatest honor. Some people also believed that producing and repairing small agricultural tools was using great talent for small purposes and was not promising.
    Is serving agriculture promising and does it require technology? The Party branch guided the masses in another self-revolution. The branch secretary said: "The County Committee requires us to serve agriculture. This is a very heavy burden. I don't think it is 'talent wasted' at all, but a lack of talent. We eat the grain grown by the peasants, and the peasants use our machines. The fate of the workers and peasants is forever linked together. Do you think this task is important!"
    People were clamoring that making agricultural tools was "talent wasted," but at this time, several communes criticized their iron-wheeled vehicles for cracking. The factory leadership seized this opportunity and sent technical workers to the countryside to let them see for themselves what they had produced for the peasants. This trip to the countryside profoundly educated many people. Before going to the countryside, fitter Sun Fengqi did not believe that the iron-wheeled vehicles would crack. After arriving at Biandan Yingzi Brigade of Dagu Ben Commune, he found that four iron-wheeled vehicles had indeed cracked. Sun Fengqi was secretly shocked. He never expected that agricultural machinery work would be so difficult, so he helped to repair them overnight. After this inspection, many people felt that what the branch secretary had said in the past was very kind. Sun Fengqi became a voluntary propagandist for serving agricultural production; the repairmen immediately replaced the two-pound inspection hammers with eight-pound sledgehammers.
    At this time, the whole country launched activities to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. The factory's Party branch first seized the essence of Lei Feng reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and distributed pamphlets of articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to the workers, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. This study played a major role, and many people deeply realized that if there is no intention to serve the peasants wholeheartedly, it will be difficult to do much good for the peasant brothers even with technology.
    Seeing the production of agricultural machinery as a revolution, no one felt that it was "unpromising" anymore, but realized that it was very promising. They broke the shackles of industry boundaries. The factory itself set up a parts sales department, and 80 percent of the self-produced and self-sold agricultural machinery was sold, and implemented a guarantee of use, repair, and return system, reducing the turnover links and reducing the burden on the peasants. They set up new agricultural tool experiment and promotion bases in six areas, sent special personnel to train part-time farmer agricultural machinery maintenance personnel for the production teams, and guided the peasants in the use of new agricultural tools.
    In order to help the peasants repair agricultural tools, the factory transferred 30 technical workers and opened a repair sales department in the factory. For the agricultural tools sent by the peasants, the workers in the repair sales department did not distinguish between products from this factory and products from other factories, did not distinguish between the county and other counties, did not distinguish between holidays and weekdays, repaired them as soon as they came, and urgent jobs were not delayed overnight. In order to facilitate the peasants to buy and repair agricultural tools, the factory also prepared houses, pots, stoves, and animal troughs, so that people who came had a place to live and horses had troughs. Because their products were excellent, the business was fair, and the service was thoughtful, peasants from Zhangwu, Yixian, Beipiao, and Kulun Banner and Naiman Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also came to buy and repair agricultural tools.
    The factory also sent workers to the countryside for roving repairs, providing door-to-door service. The repair team went to wherever they were needed, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. The workers got up early and worked late in the countryside, repairing agricultural tools and planting crops. They lived in the breeding room at night, fed the animals themselves, and never troubled the masses. A shovel and harrow in Pingnan Di Production Team of Taben Zhalan Commune was badly damaged and was about to be sold as scrap iron. When the repair team entered the village, they advised them not to sell it and racked their brains to help repair it. The commune members happily called them "agricultural tool doctors." The repair team was also an investigation team and a propaganda team. They brought advanced technology to the countryside and brought the needs and opinions of the peasants back to the factory in a timely manner. Therefore, the peasants called them "timely rain," and the workers said they were the factory's "good ears and eyes."
    People's thinking has changed, and the situation in all aspects has been renewed. In the beginning, some people thought that manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools were unpromising and they could not learn technology, so they did not want to be associated with the word "agriculture." Now, from the warm love of the peasant brothers, they feel that serving agriculture is glorious, and they like to put themselves together with the word "agriculture" everywhere and at all times. Many workers have become all-rounders who can both work and farm. When they go to the countryside, they can drive carts and be animal breeders, and they are also top-notch farmers in the fields; they can build and repair in the factory. Some workers have been rated as "Five-Good Commune Members" in the countryside and "Five-Good Workers" in the factory.
    Where is the Way Out? Ask the Peasants for Advice
    The workers' ideological problems were solved, and they wholeheartedly wanted to do more for agriculture. But what could they use to serve agricultural production? The countryside urgently needed new agricultural tools that were efficient, inexpensive, and easy to use, but the factory's products at that time were few in variety and high in price. Obviously, this could not meet the needs of the peasants.
    Could the factory produce products that meet the needs of the peasants? How could they continue to move forward? The responsible comrades of the County Committee said to them: There is a way to solve this problem, and that is to go deep into the countryside and ask the peasants for advice.
    So, the factory organized a large number of people to go to the countryside again. Before going to the countryside, the factory first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works on investigation and research and formulated an investigation and research plan. The leadership required the workers who went to the countryside to live, labor, and live with the peasants, and to investigate the needs of the countryside and expand the variety of products. A large number of workers went to the countryside, participating in labor while conducting investigations and research. They saw a lot, heard a lot, and thought deeply. They had the practice of industrial production, and they also understood the knowledge of agricultural production in the practice of agricultural labor, and finally found the direction and method for how to develop agricultural machinery products.
    For example, the plowshare is a small agricultural tool that has been used for hundreds of years. The factory produced nine specifications of this small agricultural tool and originally thought that it was almost enough. However, after the workers who went to the countryside asked the peasants for advice, they found that they still could not fully meet the needs of the countryside. An old farmer from Laohetu Commune said: "The yellow sticky soil here has a lot of stones, and your plowshare is brittle and does not suit the soil here." A farmer from Cangtu Commune said: "We have a lot of black soil here, and your plowshare is not smooth and carries a lot of soil, which makes it difficult for the animals to pull." They visited old farmers and took the plowshare to the field to try it out, experiencing from practice that sandy hills, clay, deep plowing, shallow cultivation, various regions, and various crops have special needs, and further realized that agricultural production should be adapted to local conditions and agricultural machinery needs multiple varieties, and suddenly felt that they had found a way to develop varieties. With ideological understanding in line with reality, the varieties of plowshare quickly increased, and different varieties of plowshare with different sizes, widths, thicknesses, peach shapes, swallowtail shapes, and movable plow tips were produced. With more varieties of plowshare, production teams far and near took the initiative to buy them, and the sales were very wide.
    Going to the countryside once and participating in labor once added a point of class friendship, and the workers' daring and creative spirit was also fully developed in continuous practice.
    In 1964, the peasants of Fuxin County created the "Three Ditches" experience of controlling mountains and rivers and planting trees and forests. The factory workers were very happy to hear this news and immediately sent people to the "Three Ditches" to investigate, determined to contribute to the "Three Ditches." They invited Bao Qingfu, a mountain management expert and agricultural labor model of Fuxin City, to study together; and invited the county tractor station to cooperate. Gathering wisdom and working hard, it only took 40 days to successfully trial-produce China's first tractor-drawn mountain ditching plow. This ditching plow is pulled by a Dongfanghong 54-type tractor, and the work it does every day is equivalent to the workload of 680 laborers. Last autumn, Fuxin County used the ditching plow to dredge more than 12.8 million meters of ditches, saving 580,000 labor days compared to manual treatment of slopes. The commune members praised: "The Communist Party said to manage the mountains, and the workers made mountain management machines. In a few nights, the mountains changed their appearance." When the peasants wanted to plant trees and forests, they made pit-digging drills and tree-planting tools; when the peasants wanted to fight drought, they produced various irrigation agricultural tools; when the peasants dug sweet potatoes, it was very laborious and easy to injure the surface of the sweet potatoes, so they created a sweet potato plow with an injury rate of only 2 percent and an efficiency that was dozens of times higher than manual labor. It was really whatever they wanted, and sometimes it was more thoughtful than the peasants thought.
    With the peasants in their hearts and a close connection with the peasants, the workers of the agricultural machinery factory can do everything possible to think for the peasants in production. They not only strive to meet the needs of agriculture in terms of agricultural tool varieties, but also take various measures to produce inexpensive agricultural tools for the peasants. The production costs of some major agricultural tools have been declining year by year, saving a lot of funds for the peasants. Some peasants said with emotion: "The agricultural machinery factory is really our 'iron calculator.'"

### 他们胸中有五亿农民——阜新农业机械厂全心全意为农业生产服务记事

    他们胸中有五亿农民
    ——阜新农业机械厂全心全意为农业生产服务记事
    编者按：阜新农业机械厂是全国大庆式企业之一，是农业机械行业的一个先进单位。这个先进单位是在阶级斗争的风浪里成长起来的，是在不断地兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的斗争过程中成长起来的。
    阜新农机厂开始由生产煤矿加工产品转为生产农业机械的时候，遇到了资产阶级思想的重重阻挠和抵制。工厂的招牌变了，但是人们的思想没有变。事实教育了人们：“不彻底批判资产阶级经营思想，就不能在职工中树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想，就不能做到真心为农民服务。”后来，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，横扫前进道路上的旧思想，旧习惯，才为企业的发展开拓了道路。
    阜新农机厂的先进事迹，再一次生动地说明了我们在一切工作中，都必须重视思想的作用，都必须用毛泽东思想挂帅。要使一个工厂企业纳入社会主义的轨道，纳入国家计划的轨道，首先就要把人们的思想纳入毛泽东思想的轨道。
    阜新农机厂的同志在学习了《为人民服务》等文章以后，对改造思想的重要性有了比较深切的体会。他们说得好：“没有为农民服务的思想，就不会有为农民喜欢的产品。”“要是没有全心全意为农民服务的心意，有了技术也难为农民兄弟做出多少好事来。”事实正是这样，当毛泽东思想一旦武装了他们的头脑，他们就由过去不想沾“农”字的边，变成了喜欢和“农”字摆在一起，他们就敢想敢干，敢闯敢创，办法越来越多，工作越做越活，在农村这个广阔的天地里大显身手，作出了出色的成绩。
    辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县有一家只有二百多人的小工厂。这家工厂的职工高举毛泽东思想红旗，“一心为农民、一切为农业”，在为农业生产服务的实践中做出了突出的成绩，赢得了农民的高度赞誉。这家工厂就是阜新农业机械厂。
    “为人民服务，首先要为五亿农民兄弟服务”，阜新农机厂职工在这一思想指导下，急农业生产之急，按农民需要办事，几年来发展了二百多个农机农具新品种，制造了二万四千多件机械化和半机械化农具，以及五千多万件小农具，二十多万件农机配件，同时还修理了各种农具五千多台。无论是制造、修理，还是销售农具，他们都尽力作到产品对路、应时、质好、价廉，千方百计减轻农民负担，生产成本年年大幅度降低。因为他们为农业服务得好，社员们亲切地把他们称作是自己的“兵工厂”、“好后勤”。
    阜新农业机械厂全心全意为农业服务的思想是怎样树立起来的呢？
    要为人民服务，不能为利润服务
    阜新县是个风沙干旱地区，地多人少，耕作粗放，历来产量极不稳定。中共阜新县委认为，要改变阜新农业生产落后面貌，除了靠全县农民的努力以外，还需要工业支援。因此，一九六○年县委作出了决定，要把阜新机械厂立即转为生产农具的工厂。
    阜新农机厂过去主要是为阜新煤矿加工产品，盈利很多，他们自称是阜新县的一棵“摇钱树”。现在，工厂面临着大转变，就给人们带来了严峻的考验。多数人拥护县委的决定，认为工人阶级应该做支援农业的开路先锋。也有一些人认为，这样一来，工厂赚不到钱，没有“油水”了。有的人甚至公开发牢骚，说这是“聪明人办傻事”！
    但是，在阜新县委领导下，工厂党支部经过一番动员说服，并且为了表示为农业服务的决心，在工厂大门口的招牌上加上了“农业”两个字，把机械厂改为农业机械厂。
    招牌变了，追求利润的思想不变还是不能解决问题。工厂转为农机厂不久，有些人认为生产一些大东西有利可图，他们不管农村能用不能用，第一批活就安排生产了一些粉碎机、地瓜切片机等型号大、产值大、利润也大的农业机械。产品生产出来了，可是并不适合当地农村需要，大部分产品销不出去；已经卖到农村的，有一部分也成了废物。
    第一笔生意蚀了本，有人又摇头了。他们说：“造农具是死胡同，照这样干下去，连饭碗也打掉了！”有人还拿来矿山的加工清单，宣传说：“谁有活就给谁干，谁有利就给谁干”，希望工厂走回头路。
    思想上的这个大反复，使工厂党支部清醒了头脑。他们认识到，不彻底批判资产阶级经营思想，就不能在职工中树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想，就不能做到真心为农民服务。
    工厂领导拿出主要力量首先进行了思想工作。他们组织老工人回忆对比，向职工进行阶级教育和形势教育。特别是系统地组织职工学习了毛主席关于工农关系、中国工业化道路等问题的语录。全厂职工边学边议，向只想赚钱的错误思想展开了坚决的斗争。通过这场争论，大家明确认识到，工业支援农业是巩固工农联盟、巩固社会主义制度的大问题，是工人阶级的最光荣的职责。许多职工指出，“只想赚钱，不为农民服务，这是剥削阶级思想。”“我们是工人阶级，决不能当‘摇钱树’。”
    工厂决定把农民不要的产品收回来，总结经验教训，并用事实进一步教育群众。厂长带领的一个小组奔向离厂一百多里的旧庙公社他木营子大队。这个大队刚买回一台农机厂生产的五一○型粉碎机。社员们忙碌了好几天，把锅驼机烧足了汽，一挂上粉碎机的皮带轮，哧——地一声，汽就用完了，粉碎机一动也不动。厂里来的人到现场一看就明白了：粉碎机型号太大，锅驼机带不动。队干部对工厂来的人说：“花了七百多元，买来一堆铁，不能烧不能吃！”有人解释说：“这台粉碎机效率高，一天能磨五千斤面。”社员说：“咱小庙请不起这大神。”
    学习了毛主席著作以后，面对着农民的这些批评，使下来的人深深认识到，没有为农民服务的思想，就不会有为农民喜欢的产品。他们回到工厂，把访问中见到的情况转告给全厂职工，全厂为之震动。坚持追求利润的人，也彻底检查了自己的错误思想。职工立即动手，改革了粉碎机的结构，重量由三百多斤降到一百多斤，动力从十四马力降到六马力半，成本降到八十元，而且还能用来漏粉，做豆腐。产品改好了，受到了农民的欢迎，当年生产的二百五十台粉碎机全部销售一空。
    不是“没出息”，是有大出息
    阜新农机厂为农业生产服务的过程，是一场兴无产阶级思想灭资产阶级思想的斗争过程。反对追求利润的错误思想，是这场斗争的一个回合。这场斗争的另一个回合是：为农业生产服务是不是“没出息”，是不是“屈才”。
    工厂转为农机厂以后，许多人都认为能够为大多数农民兄弟服务是自己最大的光荣。也有一部分人认为，生产、修理小农具是大才小用，没出息。
    为农业服务究竟有没有出息，要不要技术？党支部引导群众进行了又一场自我革命。支部书记说：“县委要求我们为农业服务，这是一副很重的担子，我看根本不是‘屈才’，而是缺才。我们吃农民种的粮食，农民用我们的机器，工人和农民的命运是永远联在一起的，你们说这任务重要不重要！”
    人们正在嚷嚷着造农具是“屈才”，偏偏在这个时候有好几个公社批评他们生产的铁轮车开焊。厂领导抓住这个机会，派出了技术工人下乡，让他们亲自看看他们为农民生产了什么。这次下乡使不少人受到了深刻的教育。钳工孙凤岐在未下乡前怎么也不相信铁轮车会开焊。到了大固本公社扁担营子大队以后，他发现四台铁轮车确确实实开了焊。孙凤岐心中暗暗吃惊，真没料到农机活这么费劲，便连夜帮助检修。这次检查回来，不少人感到过去支部书记的话十分亲切。孙凤岐成了为农业生产服务的义务宣传员；检修工立刻把检查手锤由两磅的换成八磅大锤。
    这时候，全国上下都展开了学习雷锋同志的活动。工厂党支部首先抓住雷锋读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事这一本质，把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章的单行本发给工人，组织大家学习毛主席著作。这次学习起了大作用，许多人深深地体会到，要是没有全心全意为农民服务的心意，有了技术也难为农民兄弟做出多少好事来。
    把生产农业机具看作是革命，再也没有人觉得是“没出息”，而认识到是大有出息了。他们打破行业界限的束缚，工厂自己设立零件销售门市部，自产自销的农机具达百分之八十，而且实行保用、保修、保退制度，减少流转环节，减少农民负担。他们在六个地区设立了新农具试验推广基点，派专人为生产队培训亦工亦农的农机维修人员，指导农民使用新农具。
    为了帮助农民修理农具，工厂抽调三十名技术工人，在厂内开设了修理门市部。修理门市部的工人对于农民送来的农机具，不分本厂产品外厂产品，不分本县外县，不分节日平日，随来随修，急活不过夜。为了方便农民来买农具、修农具，工厂还准备了房子、锅灶、牲口槽，做到来人有住处，来马有槽头。由于他们产品优良，买卖公平，服务周到，远在彰武、义县、北票以及内蒙古自治区的库伦旗、奈曼旗的农民，也赶来买农具和修农具。
    工厂还派出工人下乡巡回检修，服务上门。下乡的修理队不分春夏秋冬，哪里需要，他们就到哪里去。工人们在乡下和社员一样起早贪黑，修农具，种庄稼。晚上住在饲养室，自己喂牲口，从不麻烦群众。他本扎兰公社平南地生产队有部铲趟机坏得很厉害，准备当废铁卖。修理队进村一看，劝他们不要卖，动脑筋帮助修好了。社员高兴地称他们是“农具大夫”。修理队也是调查队、宣传队。他们把先进技术带到农村去，又把农民的需要和意见及时带回工厂来。因此，农民称他们是“及时雨”，工人说他们是工厂的“好耳目”。
    人们的思想变了，各方面的情况为之一新。当初有人认为制造农具、修理农具没有出息，学不到技术，因而不想沾“农”字的边。现在，他们从农民兄弟的热情爱戴中，觉得为农业服务光荣，处处、时时喜欢把自己和“农”字挨在一起。不少工人已变成又会做工又会种地的多面手。他们下乡会赶车，是饲养员，下田种地也是顶呱呱的庄稼人；他们在厂里能造能修。有些工人在农村被评为“五好社员”，在工厂是“五好职工”。
    出路在哪里？向农民请教
    职工的思想问题解决了，一心要为农业多做些事情。可是，拿什么东西来为农业生产服务呢？农村迫切需要效率高、价格便宜、使用方便的新农具，而工厂当时生产的产品品种既少、价格也高。显然，这样是不能满足农民需要的。
    工厂能不能拿出适合农民需要的产品呢？怎样才能继续前进呢？县委的负责同志对他们说：解决这个问题的出路是有的，那就是深入农村，向农民请教。
    于是，工厂又组织大批人员下乡了。下乡之前，工厂首先组织大家学习了毛主席关于调查研究的著作，制订了调查研究的方案。领导上要求下乡的职工要做到同农民同劳动同生活，并且从中调查农村的需要，扩大生产品种。大批工人到了农村，一边参加劳动，一边调查研究，看得多，听得广，想得也深。他们有了工业生产的实践，在农业劳动实践中又懂得了农业生产知识，终于为如何发展农机产品找到了方向和办法。
    比如铧子，是一种使用了几百年的小农具，工厂生产的这种小农具已有九种规格，原来认为这样就差不多了。可是下乡的工人一经向农民请教，就发现仍然不能完全适应农村需要。老河土公社的老农说：“这里的黄粘土、石头多，你们的铧子发脆，不合这里的土性。”苍土公社的一位农民说：“我们这里黑土地多，你们的铧子不光滑，尽带土，牲口拉着费劲。”他们一面访问老农，一面带着铧子到地里去试用，从实践中体会到沙丘、粘土、深耕、浅作、各种地区、各种庄稼都有特殊的需要，进一步认识到农业生产因地制宜，农业机械需要多品种的道理，顿时觉得找到了一条发展品种的途径。思想认识切合实际了，铧子品种迅速增加，大小、宽窄、薄厚不同，以及桃形、雁尾形、活铧尖等等不同品种的铧子都生产出来了。铧子品种多了，远近生产队都主动来购买，销路很广。
    到农村去一次，参加一次劳动，就增添一分阶级情谊，工人们敢想敢干的创造精神，也在不断实践中得到充分发扬。
    一九六四年，阜新县农民创造了治山治水、植树造林的“三沟”经验，工厂职工听到这个消息十分高兴，马上派人到“三沟”调查，决心为“三沟”出力。他们请来了治山能手、阜新市农业劳动模范包清福共同研究；请县里拖拉机站共同协作。这样集思广益，苦心钻研，只花了四十天时间，就试制成功我国第一台机引山地开沟犁。这种开沟犁用东方红五十四型拖拉机牵引，每天做的活相当于六百八十个劳动力的工作量。去年秋天，阜新县用开沟犁撩壕一千二百八十多万米，比人工治坡节省五十八万个劳动日。社员们称赞说：“共产党说治山，工人就制造治山机器，几宿工夫，山就变了样。”农民要植树造林，他们就造挖坑钻，植树苗器；农民要抗旱，他们就生产各式各样的灌溉农机具；农民刨地瓜很费力，又容易碰伤地瓜表皮，他们就创造了碰伤率只有百分之二、效率比人工提高几十倍的地瓜犁。真是要什么有什么，有时比农民想的都周到。
    农机厂职工胸中有了农民，同农民建立了亲密的联系，生产中就能千方百计地为农民打算。他们不仅从农具品种上努力满足农业的需要，而且采取各种措施来为农民生产价钱便宜的农具。一些主要农机具的生产成本逐年都有下降，为农民节省了许多资金。有的农民感动地说：“农机厂真是咱们的‘铁算盘’。”
