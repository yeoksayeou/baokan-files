    Mao Zedong Thought Takes the Lead, Cadres Take the Lead at Every Level
    《Red Flag》1966, No. 8 Editorial

    Summarizing the experience of our country's revolutionary struggle over the past few decades, thousands upon thousands of points boil down to one: Chairman Mao's writings are the highest directives for all work, and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all work. When Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead, the advance of our cause will be unstoppable and invincible. This was the case during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, and it is the same during the period of the Socialist Revolution. This is true of the Socialist Revolution on the economic front, the Socialist Revolution on the political front, and the Socialist Revolution on the ideological and cultural front.

    In recent years, a great movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively has been launched among the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and the broad ranks of revolutionary cadres. Mao Zedong Thought has increasingly taken root in the hearts of the people and has been grasped by more and more people. Precisely because of this, the Socialist Revolution has unfolded more extensively and deeply, and socialist construction has advanced more rapidly. Miracles are constantly appearing on all fronts.

    Comrade Lin Biao's proposal to "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao," and the launch of the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively in the People's Liberation Army, is a great pioneering undertaking. Comrade Lin Biao's "Study with problems in mind, study and apply creatively, combine study with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results," has become the guide for the entire army to study Chairman Mao's works and has already achieved immeasurable results. Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army has produced a large number of heroic figures, such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, Sun Leyi, etc. They have become role models for the people of the whole country to learn from. The great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively have played a tremendous role in promoting our entire revolutionary cause. "Learn from the People's Liberation Army" has become a common slogan for the people of the whole country and all walks of life. To learn from the People's Liberation Army, the most fundamental thing is to learn from their adherence to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all work, and to learn from the series of extremely important instructions on the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works put forward by Comrade Lin Biao.

    The Daqing Oilfield, when our country was encountering temporary economic difficulties, and in the face of very difficult material and technical conditions, established a glorious model for our country's socialist industrialization and for realizing the revolutionization of enterprises, and opened up a brand-new path. What did the people of Daqing rely on? They relied on Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "We rely on 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction' to start our business." The world-renowned people of Daqing are people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The whole country is learning from Daqing, and a large number of Daqing-style enterprises have emerged. The biggest feature of these enterprises is that Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead. In the words of the workers: "When people listen to Chairman Mao's words, the machines listen to people's words."

    The Dazhai Brigade, under the natural conditions of barren mountains and thin soil, without asking the state for money or materials, built high-yielding farmland and achieved successive bumper harvests, establishing a great model for our country's socialist agriculture and creating a glorious path. What did they rely on? They relied on Mao Zedong Thought. The world-renowned people of Dazhai are people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The whole country is learning from Dazhai, and a large number of Dazhai-style agricultural advanced units have emerged. The biggest feature of these agricultural advanced units is that Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead. In the words of the peasants: "Mao Zedong Thought is the best revolutionary weapon. With it, we can fight the mountains and change their appearance; fight the land and increase production; fight the water and irrigate the fields; fight the forests and make them grow; and fight against evil winds and heresies, and we can stand firm and have a clear direction."

    The Socialist Education Movement in the vast rural and urban areas of our country is carried out under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and a great socialist revolutionary movement. The fundamental experience of this revolutionary movement is also that Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead. Wherever Chairman Mao's works are studied well and applied well, wherever Mao Zedong Thought takes root in the hearts of the people, the movement will be carried out deeply and thoroughly, and people's mental outlook will undergo revolutionary and fundamental changes, and the appearance of production will also be completely new.

    In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is equally necessary to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle. How to see through all the demons and monsters? How to see through the bourgeois representatives who have sneaked into the Party? We must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. To sweep away all the demons and monsters, and to thoroughly overthrow these bourgeois representatives who have sneaked into the Party, we must also rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

    Whether to support Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle or to oppose Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, whether to advocate Mao Zedong Thought in command, politics in command, or to advocate money in command, business in command, this is the watershed between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, the watershed between revolution and counter-revolution.

    To study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, and to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all work, we must rely on the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels, and we must rely on cadres to take the lead at every level. This is an extremely important guarantee.

    Some cadres are busy attending meetings every day, issuing instructions, making phone calls, and busy with routine affairs, but they do not go to study Chairman Mao's works properly. It should be understood that doing a thousand things, ten thousand things, as long as you forget to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, you forget politics, forget the class struggle, and forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a muddle-headed person, and this is very dangerous. Without Mao Zedong Thought, all work cannot be done well. Without Mao Zedong Thought, in the great storms of class struggle, you will be dizzy and disoriented, and you will not know where to go. Without Mao Zedong Thought, you will be corrupted by bourgeois ideology, become a prisoner of bourgeois ideology, and become a revisionist. All Party cadres must deeply recognize this point and regard the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the most important thing.

    The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have achieved very good results in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively. In some places, cadres do not study as well as the masses, and leading cadres do not study as well as ordinary cadres. This phenomenon must be changed quickly. Cadres must take the lead in studying and take the lead in applying. In studying Chairman Mao's works, cadres must also learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can we talk about leadership. Cadres must first take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively in order to become revolutionary leaders.

    There are advanced examples of cadres taking the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works in various places. They study Chairman Mao's works just like the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, studying and applying creatively, combining study with application. They study in the class struggle, study in the struggle for production, and study in scientific experiments. They take the lead in studying, take the lead in working, take the lead in laboring, and take the lead in transforming their thinking. They work, labor, study, and engage in ideological revolutionization together with the masses. Therefore, their proletarian consciousness is high, their work is done well, and they can truly lead the masses. They all have Mao Zedong Thought in command in their work, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and promote everything. Party committees at all levels should pay attention to summarizing and promoting their experiences.

    When cadres and the masses seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the mental outlook of the people will change, the relationship between cadres and the masses will change, the appearance of work will change, and the appearance of production will change.

    Cadres taking the lead at every level, gradually expanding and improving the ranks of activists in learning, forming a more widespread and deeper mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively, making Mao Zedong Thought take root in the minds of the broad masses of people, and truly achieving Mao Zedong Thought in command in all work. This is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Socialist Revolution through to the end, this is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and this is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out socialist construction in the correct direction.

    Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead, cadres take the lead at every level. This is the conclusion, this is the Party's call.

    毛泽东思想领先　干部层层带头
    《红旗》一九六六年第八期社论
    总结我国几十年来的革命斗争经验，千条万条，归根到底是一条：毛主席著作是一切工作的最高指示，毛泽东思想是一切工作胜利的根本保证。毛泽东思想领先，我们事业的前进就会势如破竹，无往而不胜。新民主主义革命时期是这样，社会主义革命时期也是这样。经济战线上的社会主义革命是这样，政治战线上的社会主义革命是这样，思想文化战线上的社会主义革命也是这样。
    近几年来，在工农兵群众和广大革命干部中，兴起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的伟大运动。毛泽东思想越来越深入人心，为越来越多的人所掌握。正因为这样，社会主义革命就展开得更加广泛更加深入，社会主义建设也就更加阔步前进，各条战线上都不断地出现人间奇迹。
    林彪同志提出“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，在人民解放军中开展活学活用毛主席著作运动，这是一个伟大的创举。林彪同志提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”，成为全军学习毛主席著作的指南，已经收到了无可估量的效果。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，解放军已经出现了大批英雄人物，例如，雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、孙乐义，等等。他们成为全国人民学习的榜样。解放军活学活用毛主席著作的伟大成绩，对于我们整个革命事业起了巨大的推动作用。大学解放军，已经成为全国人民、各行各业一个普遍的行动口号。大学解放军，最根本的就是学习他们在一切工作中坚持毛泽东思想领先，就是学习林彪同志提出的活学活用毛主席著作的一系列极为重要的指示。
    大庆油田，是在我国正遭遇到暂时经济困难的时候，在各种物质技术条件都十分困难的情况下，为我国社会主义工业化，为实现企业革命化，树立了一个光辉的典范，开辟了一条崭新的道路。大庆人靠的是什么，是毛泽东思想。他们说：“我们是依靠‘两论’（《实践论》和《矛盾论》）起家的。”举世闻名的大庆人，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。全国学大庆，出现了一大批大庆式的企业。这些企业的最大特点，就是毛泽东思想领先。用工人的话来说，就是：“人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话。”
    大寨大队，在荒山秃岭、瘦土薄田的自然条件下，没有向国家要钱要物，就建成了一块块高产农田，连续获得大丰收，为我国建设社会主义农业树立了一个伟大的典型，开创了一条光辉的道路。他们靠的是什么，是毛泽东思想。举世闻名的大寨人，就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。全国学大寨，出现了一大批大寨式的农业先进单位。这些农业先进单位的最大特点，就是毛泽东思想领先。用农民的话来说，就是：“毛泽东思想是最好的革命武器，有了它就能与山斗，山变样；与地斗，地增产；与水斗，水浇田；与林斗，林成长；与歪风邪气斗，就能脚跟硬，方向明。”
    我国广大农村和城市的社会主义教育运动，是在毛泽东思想指导下开展的，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是一场伟大的社会主义革命运动。这一革命运动的根本经验，也是毛泽东思想领先。哪里对毛主席著作学得好，用得好，毛泽东思想深入人心，哪里的运动就搞得深，搞得透，人的精神面貌就会发生革命性的根本变化，生产面貌也就会焕然一新。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，同样必须坚持毛泽东思想领先。怎样识破一切牛鬼蛇神？怎样识破钻在党内的资产阶级代表人物？必须依靠毛泽东思想。横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底打倒这些钻在党内的资产阶级代表人物，也必须依靠毛泽东思想。
    是拥护毛泽东思想领先，还是反对毛泽东思想领先，是主张毛泽东思想挂帅、政治挂帅，还是主张钞票挂帅、业务挂帅，这是马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭，是革命和反革命的分水岭。
    活学活用毛主席著作，在各项工作中坚持毛泽东思想领先，必须依靠各级党委的坚强领导，必须依靠干部层层带头。这是一条极为重要的保证。
    有一些干部，天天忙于开会，发指示，打电话，忙于日常事务，就是不去好好学习毛主席著作。应当懂得，做一千件事，一万件事，只要忘记活学活用毛主席著作，就是忘记政治，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政。这就是糊涂人，这是很危险的。离开了毛泽东思想，一切工作都是做不好的。离开了毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，就会晕头转向，不知道走到哪里去。离开了毛泽东思想，自己就会被资产阶级思想所腐蚀，成为资产阶级思想的俘虏，成为修正主义者。全党干部必须深刻地认识到这一点，把活学活用毛主席著作当作头等重要的事情。
    工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作，已经取得很好的成绩。有的地方，干部不如群众学得好，领导干部不如一般干部学得好，这种现象必须迅速改变。干部必须带头学，带头用。在学习毛主席著作上，干部也必须向工农兵请教。只有这样，才能谈得上领导。干部首先要带头活学活用毛主席著作，才能成为革命的带头人。
    干部带头学习毛主席著作的先进典型，各地都有。他们学习毛主席著作，也象工农兵群众那样，活学活用，学用结合。在阶级斗争当中学，在生产斗争当中学，在科学实验当中学。他们带头学习，带头工作，带头劳动，带头改造思想。他们同群众一起工作，一起劳动，一起学习，一起搞思想革命化。因此，他们的无产阶级觉悟高，工作做得好，真正能够领导群众。他们在工作中都是毛泽东思想领先，用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，推动一切。各级党委应当注意总结和推广他们的经验。
    干部和群众认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，人的精神面貌就会改观，干部和群众的关系就会改观，工作面貌就会改观，生产面貌就会改观。
    干部层层带头，逐步扩大和提高学习积极分子的队伍，形成更广泛更深入的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，使毛泽东思想在广大人民群众的头脑里扎根，在一切工作中真正做到毛泽东思想领先。这是把社会主义革命进行到底的根本保证，这是巩固无产阶级专政的根本保证，这是沿着正确方向进行社会主义建设的根本保证。
    毛泽东思想领先，干部层层带头。这就是结论，这就是党的号召。
