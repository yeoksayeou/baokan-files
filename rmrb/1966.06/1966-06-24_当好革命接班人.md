    After hearing the Party Central Committee and the State Council's announcement of the reform of the college entrance examination system, students of all ethnic groups in our school spread the news and could not express their excitement. Tears filled our eyes, and we were overjoyed. Chairman Mao, beloved Chairman Mao, we have thousands of words to express to you. We, the people of all ethnic groups, deeply feel that you are the person who understands us the most. Without you, there would be no liberation and prosperity for our minority nationalities. Today, with this boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, we sing and dance, and come together to Tiananmen Square to express the heartfelt feelings of our people of all ethnic groups to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.
    Although it was raining heavily at the time and we were soaked to the bone, the flames of revolution in our hearts burned even brighter. We seemed to see the great leader Chairman Mao, and seemed to hear Chairman Mao's earnest teachings: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, and are in a period of great prosperity, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." Beloved Chairman Mao! At this moment, we deeply realize how profound your expectations are for us, and how heavy the burden on our shoulders is. We must preserve the country that our fathers won with their blood, fundamentally change the backward economic and cultural conditions of minority nationalities, support the liberation movements of oppressed nations and oppressed peoples around the world, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end!
    We are graduating high school students, and we give the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council our complete support and wholehearted approval. We are determined to temper ourselves in the wind and test ourselves in the rain, and to be reliable successors to the proletariat!

    当好革命接班人
    中央民族学院附中　高三（二）班
    听到党中央和国务院发出的改革高等学校招考办法后，我校各族同学纷纷奔走相告，激动的心情无法形容。我们热泪盈眶，欢喜若狂。毛主席，敬爱的毛主席，我们有千言万语要向您倾吐，我们各族人民深深感到您是我们最知心的人。没有您就没有我们少数民族的翻身解放和繁荣昌盛。今天，我们怀着这种对党和毛主席无限热爱的感情，载歌载舞，一齐来到天安门广场，向党中央和毛主席表达我们各族人民的一片心意。
    尽管当时下起了暴雨，我们浑身上下被雨淋透，但是，我们心中革命的火焰越烧越旺。我们仿佛看见了伟大的领袖毛主席，仿佛听到毛主席的谆谆教导：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”敬爱的毛主席啊！此时我们又深深体会到，您对我们的期望是多么深切，我们肩上的担子多么繁重。我们要保住父辈们用鲜血换来的江山，要根本改变少数民族经济文化落后的面貌，要支持世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放运动，要将中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
    我们是应届高中毕业生，党中央、国务院的决定，我们一千个拥护，一万个赞成。我们下定决心，要在风里锻炼，在雨里考验，要当好无产阶级可靠的接班人！
