    After hearing the news from the radio about the Party Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee's decision to reorganize the Peking University Party Committee, all the staff and workers and their families of our division were extremely happy and resolutely support the decision of the Party Central Committee. We warmly cheer the great victory of the revolutionary people of Beijing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. You are worthy of being the people of the capital of our great motherland, worthy of being the people around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Your fighting spirit and the great victories you have achieved have given us great encouragement and have set a brilliant example for the people of the whole country to further carry out the socialist cultural revolution. Now, the people of the whole country are sweeping away all monsters and demons with the force of a thunderbolt. Through this Cultural Revolution, the socialist revolution in our country will surely enter a new high tide. Our Sixth Agricultural Division of the Production and Construction Corps of Xinjiang Military Region, fighting at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, is a well-trained fighting force personally cultivated by Chairman Mao. Many of us are old Red Army soldiers, old Eighth Route Army soldiers, and old fighters who came from Jinggangshan. They personally participated in the battles to defend Yan'an, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Chairman Mao. Our division has a glorious revolutionary tradition. In every revolutionary period, we have resolutely supported and thoroughly implemented the Party Central Committee's policies and Chairman Mao's instructions. Every comrade is a loyal fighter of Chairman Mao. In the past, we fought to the death with enemies holding guns in order to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Today, we are also fighting to the death with enemies without guns in order to defend the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought. Now we swear to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will always listen to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we will always be loyal fighters of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    永远做毛主席的忠诚战士
    当我们从广播里听到党中央决定改组北京市委和新北京市委决定改组北京大学党委的消息以后，我师全体职工、家属万分高兴，坚决拥护党中央的决定。我们热烈欢呼北京市革命人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。你们不愧为我们伟大祖国首都的人民，不愧为在党中央和毛主席身边的人民。你们的斗争精神和取得的伟大胜利，给了我们极大鼓舞，给全国人民进一步开展社会主义文化大革命作出了光辉榜样。现在，全国人民正以雷霆万钧之势，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。通过这次文化大革命，我国的社会主义革命必将进入一个新的高潮。我们战斗在天山脚下的生产建设兵团农六师，是毛主席亲手培养起来的一支久经锻炼的战斗部队。我们当中有不少是从井冈山下来的老红军和老八路、老战士，他们都亲自参加过保卫延安、保卫党中央、保卫毛主席的战斗。我们师有着光荣的革命传统，在每一个革命时期，都是坚决拥护和彻底贯彻党中央的方针政策与毛主席的指示，每个同志都是毛主席的忠实战士。过去，我们为了保卫党中央和毛主席，同拿枪的敌人作过决死的战斗；今天，我们为了保卫党中央和毛泽东思想，也同样与不拿枪的敌人作决死的斗争。现在我们向党中央和毛主席宣誓：我们永远听党中央和毛主席的话，永远作党中央和毛主席的忠诚战士。
