    Destroy the Counter-Revolutionary Cultural Fortress
    Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others: After reading your big-character poster exposing how the "Three-Family Village" gang members Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun stubbornly resisted and defended their reactionary fortress, all comrades in our Chinese Department were infinitely excited and elated. We express our warmest support for your fearless revolutionary actions in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending the socialist system, and waging a merciless struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements! You did the right thing! You exposed them well! You struck hard! You struck satisfyingly! Your big-character poster is like a shell, destroying an anti-Party fortress and scaring anti-Party and anti-socialist elements out of their wits, leaving them with nowhere to hide. This is a major victory for the socialist cultural revolution and a major victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    Now, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the nationwide socialist cultural revolution is sweeping away all monsters and demons with overwhelming force, seizing one cultural position after another that they have occupied, and destroying counter-revolutionary cultural fortresses. No monster or demon can escape the revolutionary iron fist of the people. Their attempt to stubbornly resist is bound to meet with shameful failure and complete bankruptcy, just like Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun.
    Comrades! Your revolutionary actions have set a very good example for us. Facts prove that all reactionaries are never reconciled to their failure. If you don't strike at the reactionaries, they will never fall. We must learn from your fearless revolutionary spirit of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely overthrow all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, no matter what banner they fly, how high their position, or how old their qualifications, as long as they oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee! "Dare to unhorse the emperor at the risk of one's own life." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to break through, and dare to make revolution. We will never give up until the socialist cultural revolution is carried through to the end!
    The unprecedented great tide of the socialist cultural revolution in human history is surging forward. No anti-Party or anti-socialist element can resist or stop it. All anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are bound to be completely swallowed up by the revolutionary historical trend and smashed to pieces by the iron fists of the broad masses of revolutionary people! Comrades! Let us fight together for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution under the brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought!
    All comrades of the Chinese Department of Anhui University

    摧毁反革命的文化堡垒
    聂元梓等同志：读了你们揭发“三家村”黑帮分子宋硕、陆平、彭珮云负隅顽抗、坚守反动堡垒的大字报，我们中文系全体同志都无限振奋，欢欣鼓舞。我们对于你们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫社会主义制度，跟一切反党反社会主义分子作无情斗争的大无畏的革命行动，表示我们的最热烈的支持！你们做得对！揭得好！你们打得狠！打得痛快！你们的大字报就象一颗炮弹，炸毁了一个反党的堡垒，炸得反党反社会主义分子胆战心惊，没有藏身之地。这是社会主义文化大革命的一个重大胜利，是毛泽东思想的一个重大胜利。
    现在，全国的社会主义文化大革命，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，以排山倒海之势，正在横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，正在夺取被他们所占领的一个又一个的文化阵地，摧毁反革命的文化堡垒。一切牛鬼蛇神，是一个也逃不掉人民的革命铁拳的。他们妄图负隅顽抗，就必定要象宋硕、陆平、彭珮云那样遭到可耻的失败和彻底的破产。
    同志们！你们的革命行动给我们树立了一个很好的榜样。事实证明，一切反动派是决不甘心他们的失败的，对于反动派，你不打，他是决不会倒的。我们一定学习你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大无畏的革命精神。对一切反党反社会主义分子，不论他们打着什么旗号，有多高的职位，多老的资格，只要他们反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席和党中央的指示，我们就一定都要坚决地把他们彻底打倒！“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。”我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命，不把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，决不罢休！
    人类历史上空前伟大的社会主义文化大革命的浪潮，汹涌澎湃，这是任何反党反社会主义分子所绝对顽抗不了、阻挡不了的。一切反党反社会主义分子必定要被革命的历史潮流完全吞没，必定要被广大革命人民的铁拳打得粉碎！同志们！让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，为文化大革命的彻底胜利而共同战斗吧！
    安徽大学中文系全体同志
