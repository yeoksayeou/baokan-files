    Commune members in the wheat-producing areas of Jiangsu Province are carefully harvesting anti-rust and high-yield tri-wheat improved varieties, preparing for the widespread adoption of tri-wheat improved varieties during this autumn's sowing.
    In the past year, the Huaihe River wheat-producing areas of Jiangsu Province focused on promoting anti-rust and high-yield tri-wheat (barley, wheat, and buckwheat) improved varieties. After last summer's harvest, a large quantity of anti-rust improved varieties was transferred to support brother counties in expanding cultivation. This year, the key promotion area in Jiangsu Province is the wheat region south of the Huai River. Starting in April, each district organized work groups composed of leaders, technicians, and experienced farmers to conduct field inspections in various places with a focus, and held symposiums with local experienced farmers. Based on years of experimental and inspection data, they selected anti-rust improved varieties suitable for local cultivation. In mid-May, representatives from the wheat regions south of the Huai River held a tri-wheat anti-rust improved variety evaluation meeting in Suzhou. They compared and evaluated the varieties one by one on-site, and determined the anti-rust and high-yield varieties to be promoted in the southern Huai River wheat region. Before the start of the harvest, the communes and teams, based on the specific conditions of local labor force and stubble, implemented the seed retention area for various varieties, and carried out head selection and patch selection. Through such bottom-up and top-down selection and implementation, each wheat region has retained sufficient improved seeds for this autumn's sowing. It is estimated that this autumn's sowing area of anti-rust and high-yield tri-wheat improved varieties will account for more than 90% of the total tri-wheat sowing area in the province.

    江苏精细收打抗锈高产三麦良种
    江苏省产麦区的社员正在精细收打抗锈、高产的三麦良种，为今年秋播时普及三麦良种作好准备。
    前年，江苏省淮北麦产区重点推广了抗锈、高产的三麦（大麦、小麦、元麦）良种，去年夏收后，就将抗锈良种大量外调，支援兄弟县扩种。今年江苏省的重点推广地区是淮河以南麦区。从四月份起，各专区纷纷组织由领导、技术人员和老农组成的工作组，到各地有重点地进行田间考察，召开当地老农座谈会，根据历年试验考察资料，选择适宜于当地种植的抗锈良种。五月中旬，淮河以南各麦区代表在苏州举行了三麦抗锈良种评选会议，在现场将品种一个一个地比较、评选，确定了在淮南麦区推广的抗锈、高产品种。各地在开镰收割前，按社队根据本地劳动力、茬口等具体情况，落实了各种品种的留种面积，进行了穗选、片选。经过这样自下而上和自上而下的评选、落实，各麦区为今年秋播留足了良种。预计今年秋播时，抗锈、高产的三麦良种种植面积，将占全省三麦种植总面积百分之九十以上。
