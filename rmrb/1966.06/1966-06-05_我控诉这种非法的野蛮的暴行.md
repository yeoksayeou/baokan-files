    I Accuse This Illegal and Savage Atrocity
    Sun Yuecai, Graduate Student, Department of Philosophy, Peking University
    In order to defend the Party Central Committee and defend Mao Zedong Thought, I fought against the "Three-Family Village" black gang; but a group of people headed by the black gang element Lu Ping, labeled me as an "anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist," kidnapped and besieged me, and illegally and savagely abused and tortured me. It was Chairman Mao who led us to carry out the Great Cultural Revolution, ferreted out Lu Ping and his gang of villains, and "reversed the verdict" for me. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    On May 25th, I was subjected to illegal and savage persecution with leadership and organization, headed by Lu Ping.
    That evening, our teachers and students of the Department of Philosophy had just finished holding a mass meeting to denounce the "Three-Family Village" black gang. The touching scenes of the poor and lower-middle peasants and worker representatives, who were invited to participate in the meeting, tearfully condemning the Deng Tuo black gang still lingered in our minds. A gang of people rushed into the meeting place aggressively, clamoring to "question" Nie Yuanzi. At that time, I was extremely angry at this unreasonable behavior, so I loudly told the comrades to leave the classroom and ignore their actions. At this time, this group of people already harbored resentment towards me.
    A while later, this group of people went on stage in front of the large dining hall and "lectured" to hundreds of people, "questioning" Nie Yuanzi and adding many anti-Party and anti-socialist "crimes" to Comrade Nie Yuanzi. The accusations made were all unfounded nonsense, saying that firing at the school Party committee on the eve of the school-wide denunciation of Deng Tuo was to divert the target of struggle, and that we were confronting the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with leadership, organization, and planning, and so on. This person's "speech" was "approved" by some people. I saw that these students had been deceived, so I went on stage to speak, saying that this group of people had rushed into the classroom to disrupt order and sabotage the meeting. We had no intention of diverting the target of the struggle. Our exposure of the Party committee was to better fight the "Three-Family Village" black gang. Before I could say a few words, they pushed me down with a lot of noise and activity. Some people were clenching their fists, ready to fight (but were stopped by comrades who secretly supported me), and some shouted, "Don't let him escape, grab him and take him to the school security team!"
    Later, this group of people pushed me onto the stage again, telling me to finish speaking. When I said that we should not create divisions among the students, and that I believed that ninety-nine percent of the students (I now admit that this percentage is inappropriate, my estimate was too high) were fighting against the "Three-Family Village" black gang in order to defend the Party Central Committee and defend Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as I finished speaking, a chorus of "Nonsense!" rose from the audience. Then, I was pushed down again and held tightly by several people. Followed by a group of people, I was dragged like a prisoner to a high ground in front of the third canteen, claiming to "debate" with me. Then, a barrage of questions came down non-stop, and I was blindly attacked and scolded as "Deng Tuo's running dog," "rightist," "anti-Party," and so on. Finally, I was violently pushed off the high ground by this group of people.
    At this time, the Party committee sent someone over. This group of people dragged me in front of him, and I told him my views. He remained cold and indifferent, only telling me to go back. However, this group of people refused to let me go, and I was still taken by them to the 30th Dormitory Committee, to continue "debating" with me.
    I was thus illegally and savagely abused and tortured by them for more than two hours.
    Until the evening of June 1st, when the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the big-character poster of Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others to the whole country, I had always been the target of hostile gazes from a few people with ulterior motives and some masses who were deceived and kept in the dark at Peking University. They regarded me as a thorn in their side, as an anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist.
    This made me feel extremely grieved and indignant!
    Thinking back to before liberation, how much suffering and humiliation our family had suffered! The Japanese devils brought our family to ruin. My father was brutally killed by the Japanese devils after being injected with germs, and he rotted overnight. My brother was captured by the Japanese devils to do hard labor, and he was almost beaten to death by the Japanese devils with iron rods. My mother led our three brothers to struggle on the brink of death. We couldn't even eat chaff, and we were subjected to all kinds of insults from landlords and rich peasants. This national hatred and class hatred can never be forgotten.
    It was the great Party, it was the great Chairman Mao who liberated us from hell. From then on, we saw the light of day. Our family underwent a thorough transformation in politics, economy, and cultural life. I have studied at a university, taught at a university, and now I am a graduate student at a university, which I would never have dared to dream of in the past!
    The Party gave us everything, Chairman Mao gave us everything. I infinitely love Chairman Mao, infinitely worship Chairman Mao, and infinitely love the great Party and the socialist cause. When the bourgeois rightists launched an attack on the Party and socialism in 1957, I also stood firm and actively fought against the rightists in order to defend the Party and socialism. Now, in order to defend the Party and socialism, I am regarded by them as a "rightist," which is extremely infuriating! But I don't blame those students who don't know the truth, many of them want to make revolution, but they have been temporarily deceived. What I want to pursue is the instigator and organizer behind the scenes. I want to thank Chairman Mao again, it was Chairman Mao who "reversed the verdict" for me, so that overnight I changed from what they slandered as an "anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist" to a revolutionary leftist!
    I want to question Lu Ping: Why did you launch a counterattack against Comrade Nie Yuanzi and other comrades who adhered to the truth? What are your intentions? Who instructed and organized a group of people to agitate and deceive the masses, kidnap and besiege revolutionary leftists, and adopt this illegal and savage atrocity?
    Lu Ping, we have long seen through your true face, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all monsters and demons, carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and ensure that we will victoriously transition from socialism to great communism!
    Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!
                                    (Big-character poster of the Department of Philosophy, Peking University)

    我控诉这种非法的野蛮的暴行
    北京大学哲学系研究生　孙月才
    为了保卫党中央，保卫毛泽东思想，我同“三家村”黑帮进行了战斗；但是以黑帮分子陆平为首的一伙人，把我说成是“反党反社会主义右派”，对我进行绑架围攻，非法地、野蛮地虐待和折磨我。是毛主席领导我们开展了文化大革命，揪出了陆平这伙坏蛋，给我“翻了案”。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
    我在五月二十五日，遭到了以陆平为首的，有领导，有组织，非法的野蛮的迫害。
    那天晚上，我们哲学系师生刚开完声讨“三家村”黑帮的群众大会，脑际还萦回着被邀参加大会的贫下中农代表、工人代表的声泪俱下的痛斥邓拓黑帮的感人情景。一伙人却气势汹汹地冲进了会场，叫嚷要“质问”聂元梓。当时，我对这种无理行径极为气愤，便大声叫同志们退出教室，不要去理会他们那一套。这时，这伙人对我已怀恨在心。
    一会儿，这伙人又在大饭厅前，上台向数百人“演说”，“质问”聂元梓，给聂元梓同志加上了许多反党反社会主义的“罪名”。所提出的指责，都是毫无根据的胡说，说什么在全校声讨邓拓的大会前夕向校党委开火，是为了转移斗争目标呀，什么我们是有领导，有组织，有计划地对抗党中央毛主席呀，等等。这个人的“演说”，受到了一些人的“赞许”。我看这些同学受骗了，因此上台发言，说刚才这伙人冲进教室扰乱秩序，破坏大会。我们没有意思要转移斗争目标。我们揭露党委，是为了更好地打“三家村”黑帮。我还没有讲几句，就被他们大吵大闹、七手八脚地推了下来。有的人磨拳擦掌，大有打的架势（被暗中支持我的同志阻止了），有的大叫“别让他逃了，抓到校卫队去！”
    后来，这伙人又拥我上台，叫我讲完。当我讲到在同学中不要制造分裂，我相信百分之九十九的同学（我现在承认这个百分比是不妥当的，我的估计太高了），都是为了保卫党中央，保卫毛泽东思想，和“三家村”黑帮进行战斗。话音刚落，台下响起了一片“胡说！”声。接着，我又被推了下来，并被几个人紧紧架着胳膊。后面跟着一批人，把我当犯人一样，前呼后拥地被拉到三食堂前的一块高地上，声称要和我“辩论”。于是，连珠炮般的质问，没头没脑地打下来，并且大骂我是“邓拓的走狗”、“右派”、“反党”，等等。最后，我就被这伙人猛烈地推下高地。
    这时，党委派来了一个人。这伙人把我拉到他跟前，我述说了自己的看法。他冷冰冰地不表示态度，只叫我回去。但是，这伙人却不肯放我，还是被他们拥到卅斋团委会，要同我继续“辩论”。
    我就这样被他们非法地、野蛮地虐待和折磨了两个多钟头。
    直到六月一日晚上，中央人民广播电台向全国播送聂元梓等同志的大字报前，我一直是北京大学少数别有用心的人以及一些被欺骗蒙在鼓里的群众怒目相视的人物。他们把我看成眼中钉，看成反党反社会主义的右派。
    这使我感到无比的悲愤！
    回想解放前，我们家受过多少的苦难和凌辱呀！日本鬼子弄得我们家破人亡。爸爸被鬼子打细菌针暴死，一夜就腐烂了。哥哥被鬼子抓去做苦工，差一点被鬼子用铁棍打死。妈妈领着我们兄弟三人在死亡线上挣扎。我们连糠也吃不上，还受尽了地主富农的侮辱。这民族仇，阶级恨，是永远也忘不了的。
    是伟大的党，是伟大的毛主席把我们从地狱中解放出来了。从此，我们见了天日。我们家从政治、经济，到文化生活都彻底翻了身。我读过大学，教过大学，现在又在大学里当研究生，这在过去是怎敢梦想的呀！
    党给了我们一切，毛主席给了我们一切。我无限地热爱毛主席，无限地崇拜毛主席，无限地热爱伟大的党和社会主义事业。当一九五七年资产阶级右派向党和社会主义发动进攻时，我也曾站定脚跟，为保卫党和社会主义，积极地向右派分子作了斗争。现在我为了保卫党和社会主义，却被他们目为“右派”，这是何等令人气愤的事！但我不怪那些不明真相的同学，他们当中很多人是要革命的，只是暂时地被欺骗了。我要追究的，是这幕后的指使者和组织者。我要再次地感谢毛主席，是毛主席给我“翻了案”，使我在一夜间，从他们诬蔑的什么“反党反社会主义的右派”，变成了革命的左派！
    我要质问陆平：为什么你要向坚持真理的聂元梓等同志进行反扑？你居心何在？是谁指使和组织了一伙人在群众中进行煽动、欺骗，对革命的左派进行绑架、围攻，采取了这种非法的、野蛮的暴行？
    陆平，我们早就看透了你的真面目，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级的文化大革命进行到底，保证我们将由社会主义胜利地过渡到伟大的共产主义！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
