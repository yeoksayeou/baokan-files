    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 12th – The Malian delegation, led by Mamadou Madeira Keita, member of the Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union Party of Mali and Minister of Justice of Mali, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi and Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Wang Yilun, visited Baotou City and the pastoral area of Dazhai – the Wushenzhao Pastoral People's Commune – on the 11th and 12th.

    On the morning of the 11th, the Malian guests and their entourage arrived in Baotou from Hohhot by helicopter. They were greeted at the airport by Han Feng, Acting Mayor of Baotou City, and others. The guests visited the Baotou Gelatin Factory and the Baotou Leather Factory. The Baotou Gelatin Factory can process 2,500 tons of animal bones annually and produce 250 tons of gelatin. In the past, these animal bones were discarded in the pastoral areas. The Baotou Leather Factory can process 100,000 cattle hides annually and produce approximately 150,000 pairs of leather shoes. Before liberation, the factory's annual output was only equivalent to one week's current production. In the afternoon, the Malian guests visited the coking plant, iron-smelting plant, and steel-making plant of Baogang (Baotou Steel). Over the past few years, this iron and steel complex has overcome the difficulties brought about by the modern revisionists' perfidious tearing up of contracts, withdrawal of experts, and cessation of equipment supply. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, it has adhered to the policy of striving for progress and self-reliance, and has achieved great victories in production and construction. In the evening, Han Feng, Acting Mayor of Baotou City, hosted a banquet to welcome the Malian guests. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Wang Yilun, and others were invited to attend. Mamadou Madeira Keita spoke at the banquet, warmly praising the great achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the new relations of national unity. He expressed his intention to bring back to Mali the Chinese people's experience of self-reliance, daring to revolutionize, and grasping Mao Zedong Thought.

    Today, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Wang Yilun, the delegation traveled from Baotou by helicopter to visit the pastoral area of Dazhai – the Wushenzhao Pastoral People's Commune. This commune on the Ordos Grassland, with its revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and its unwavering determination like the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains, has achieved great success in transforming the desert, eradicating drunken horse grass (a poisonous weed), building grasslands, and gradually realizing settled nomadism and stable, comprehensive, and high-speed development of animal husbandry. Many herders and cadres in this commune are active in studying Chairman Mao's works. After visiting artificially cultivated "grass gardens," forests, and wheat fields, the Malian guests watched Mongolian-style artistic performances on the grassland. After visiting the commune, the guests wrote in the visitors' book that they had witnessed a vibrant scene of profound revolution in the heartland grasslands of socialist new China's Inner Mongolia.

    In the evening, Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a banquet in Hohhot to entertain the Malian guests.

    新华社呼和浩特十二日电　由马里苏丹联盟党政治局委员、马里司法部长马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔率领的马里代表团，由国务院副总理陈毅和内蒙古自治区副主席王逸伦等陪同，十一日和十二日参观了包头市和牧区大寨——乌审召牧区人民公社。
    十一日上午，马里贵宾等一行乘直升飞机从呼和浩特到达包头。他们在机场受到包头市代市长寒峰等人的迎接。贵宾们参观了包头精胶厂和包头皮革厂。包头精胶厂每年能加工两千五百吨兽骨，生产二百五十吨明胶，而牧区的这些兽骨过去都是废弃不用的。包头皮革厂每年能加工十万张牛皮，另外每年还能生产十五万双左右的皮鞋。解放前这个工厂每年的生产量只相当于现在一个星期的产量。下午，马里贵宾们来到包钢参观了炼焦厂、炼铁厂和炼钢厂。这个钢铁联合企业在过去几年里克服了现代修正主义者背信弃义地撕毁合同、撤走专家、停止供应设备所带来的困难，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持奋发图强、自力更生的方针，在生产建设上取得了巨大胜利。晚上，包头市代市长寒峰设宴欢迎马里贵宾。陈毅副总理、自治区副主席王逸伦等应邀出席。马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔在宴会上讲话，他热烈赞扬内蒙古自治区的巨大成就和新的民族团结关系，并表示要把中国人民的自力更生和敢于革命以及掌握毛泽东思想的经验，带回马里去。
    代表团今天由陈毅副总理和自治区副主席王逸伦等陪同，从包头乘直升飞机来到牧区大寨——乌审召牧区人民公社进行了参观。鄂尔多斯草原上的这个公社，以自力更生的革命精神和愚公移山的坚强毅力，在改造沙漠、铲除醉马草（一种毒草）、建设草原、逐步实现定居游牧和稳定、全面、高速度发展畜牧业等方面取得了巨大成就。这个公社的许多牧民和干部都是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。马里贵宾在这里参观了人工培育的“草园”、树林和麦田后，在草地观赏了具有蒙古民族特色的文艺节目。贵宾们参观这个公社后题词说，他们在社会主义新中国的内蒙古的心脏草原上看到了一派深刻革命的蓬勃发展景象。
    晚上，陈毅副总理在呼和浩特设宴招待马里贵宾。
