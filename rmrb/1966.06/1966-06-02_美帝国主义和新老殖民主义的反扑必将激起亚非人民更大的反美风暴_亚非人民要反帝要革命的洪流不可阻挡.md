    (Dispatch from this newspaper) In the face of the successive victories and deepening of the national democratic movement in Asia and Africa, imperialism, headed by the United States, is carrying out even more frantic struggles and counterattacks, attempting to regain control of Asia and Africa, turn back the wheel of history in Asia and Africa, and plunge hundreds of millions of Asian and African people back into the abyss of colonialism.
    In Asia, although U.S. imperialism has been battered and bloodied, it still refuses to leave. As recently as May 21, U.S. President Johnson, at an impromptu press conference held at the White House, clamored that the United States would "make the greatest effort" to act recklessly in South Vietnam. Secretary of State Rusk also clamored at a meeting of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations on the 24th that the United States would "continue to do what is necessary" in South Vietnam to "repel aggression." However long it takes, the United States will persist.
    After the Indonesian right-wing generals group launched a counter-revolutionary military coup under the planning of U.S. imperialism, the U.S. ruling group has intensified its control over Indonesia step by step. Recently, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed the 1967 U.S. "foreign aid program," which included the issue of "aid" to Indonesia. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara said at the meeting with great satisfaction that the U.S.'s past military "aid" to Indonesia was a "good investment." He also stated that this "aid" had enabled the United States to maintain "contact" with those Indonesian right-wing generals groups that "played a major role in the recent government changes." The eagerness of U.S. imperialist forces to return to Indonesia is very clear. McNamara had previously stated: "The door must be opened to establish a more active relationship whenever policy in Indonesia permits."
    U.S. imperialism sees the success of the counter-revolutionary coup in Indonesia as a great opportunity to reopen the door to controlling Asia. The *New York Times* said in an editorial on May 30: "For the United States and Britain, now is the time for an important strategic study of Asia." The newspaper went on to say that a new so-called "security system" must be established for the whole of Asia. It also believed that "a stable Indonesia" "can play the role of a solid anchor in Southeast Asia."
    In Africa, old and new colonialists, headed by the United States, planned and launched a series of counter-revolutionary military coups, and repeatedly played the trick of "changing horses" in the Congo (Leopoldville). In particular, the military coup in Ghana in February this year, instigated by British and American imperialism, was the largest counterattack by imperialism against the African national liberation movement since the overthrow of the Lumumba government in the Congo (Leopoldville) in 1960.
    An article in the *New York Herald Tribune* on April 6 gleefully offered advice to the Johnson administration, saying that the United States should "consider giving Africa 'large-scale' aid." The newspaper said that due to the rise of some so-called "new African leaders," "there is a new possibility of effectively using overseas public and private capital." It also said: "If the West has luck in Africa, then we must take some clever way to take advantage of this luck."
    In a speech to African diplomatic officials in Washington on May 26, U.S. President Johnson proposed that the United States should build a so-called "modern Africa." The ambition of U.S. imperialism to replace old-brand colonial countries and rule and enslave Africa is clearly revealed.
    However, imperialism absolutely cannot stop the torrent of the Asian and African revolution. The U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has been severely hit by the heroic Vietnamese people and resolutely opposed by the people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world. The multiple coups and subversive activities recently instigated by imperialism have not only failed to intimidate the people of Asia and Africa, but have played a beneficial role as negative teachers, accelerating the awakening of the people of Asia and Africa and mobilizing them to rise up and wage a more resolute struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's planning of the reactionary military coup in Indonesia has aroused severe condemnation from progressive public opinion around the world. The Vietnamese magazine *Hoc Tap* pointed out that "the counter-revolutionary actions of U.S. imperialism and the pro-American reactionary group in Indonesia do not indicate their strength. From a global perspective, this is only a partial counterattack in the entire situation of U.S. imperialism being attacked and defeated for a long time." A commentary in the Tanzanian newspaper *The Nationalist* stated that the history of Indonesia and all developing countries shows that "the people will ultimately be victorious, and the imperialists will be defeated." The reactionary coups instigated by imperialism in Ghana and several other African countries have also aroused a new anti-imperialist storm among the African people. A mass rally of 70,000 people was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, with participants chanting slogans such as "Down with imperialism" and "Down with neo-colonialism." Thousands of workers in Bamako, the capital of Mali, held demonstrations and marches, raising their arms and shouting: "No imperialism, no old and new colonialism, we want true independence, we want African dignity!"
    The people of Asia and Africa have realized more clearly from the frantic counterattacks of imperialism that imperialism, headed by the United States, is still their mortal enemy. The Guinean newspaper *La Liberté* said it well: "Imperialism is slaughtering the people of our countries, precisely digging its own grave, and is prompting a new revolutionary storm to brew on the African continent."

### 美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的反扑必将激起亚非人民更大的反美风暴  亚非人民要反帝要革命的洪流不可阻挡

    美帝国主义和新老殖民主义的反扑必将激起亚非人民更大的反美风暴
    亚非人民要反帝要革命的洪流不可阻挡
    本报讯　在亚非民族民主运动节节胜利、步步深入的形势面前，以美国为首的帝国主义正进行更加疯狂的挣扎和反扑，妄图重新控制亚非，使亚非历史的车轮倒转，把亿万亚非人民重新投入殖民主义的深渊。
    在亚洲，美帝国主义虽然被打得头破血流，但是它却仍然赖着不走。直到最近，美国总统约翰逊五月二十一日在白宫举行的临时记者招待会上还叫嚷美国要“尽最大的努力”，在南越蛮干下去。美国国务卿腊斯克二十四日在美国外交学会的一次会议上也叫嚷，美国在南越将“继续做必要的事情”来“击退侵略”。需要多久，美国就要坚持多久。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团在美帝国主义的策划下发动反革命军事政变后，美国统治集团步步加紧对印度尼西亚的控制。最近美国参议院外交委员会讨论了一九六七年度美国“援外方案”，其中就包括对印度尼西亚“援助”的问题。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在会上十分得意地说，美国过去对印度尼西亚的军事“援助”是“很好的投资”。他还表示，这一“援助”曾使得美国能够同那些“在最近的政府变动中起了很大作用”的印度尼西亚右派将领集团保持“接触”。美帝国主义势力重返印度尼西亚的迫不及待的心情是很清楚的。麦克纳马拉在此以前早就表示：“必须敞开大门，在印度尼西亚的政策允许的任何时候，建立比较积极的关系。”
    美帝国主义把印度尼西亚的反革命政变成功，看成是它重新打开控制亚洲之门的大好机会。《纽约时报》在五月三十日的社论中说：“对美国和英国来说，现在是对亚洲进行重要的战略研究的时期了。”这家报纸接着说，必须建立一个新的用于整个亚洲的所谓“安全系统”。它并且认为，“一个稳定的印度尼西亚”，“可以发挥东南亚的一个牢固的船锚的作用”。
    在非洲，以美国为首的新老殖民主义者，策划并发动了一系列的反革命军事政变，并且在刚果（利）一再玩弄“换马”的把戏。特别是今年二月，英美帝国主义在加纳策动的军事政变，是继一九六○年刚果（利）卢蒙巴政府被颠覆以后，帝国主义对非洲民族解放运动的一次最大的反扑。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》四月六日的文章得意忘形地向约翰逊政府献策，美国应当“考虑给非洲‘大批’援助”。这家报纸说，由于一些所谓“新的非洲领袖”上台，“有效地利用海外公私资本就有了新的可能性”。它并且说：“如果西方在非洲交了运，那么我们必须采取某种聪明的办法利用这种运气。”
    美国总统约翰逊五月二十六日在华盛顿对非洲外交官员的讲话中，提出了要由美国来建立一个所谓“现代非洲”。美帝国主义妄想取代老牌殖民国家，统治和奴役非洲的野心昭然若揭。
    但是，帝国主义绝对阻挡不了亚非革命的洪流。美帝国主义侵略越南的战争已经遭到英雄的越南人民的沉重打击，遭到亚非人民和全世界人民的坚决反对。帝国主义最近一个时期多次策动政变和颠覆活动，不仅没有吓倒亚非人民，反而起了有益的反面教员的作用，更快地提高了亚非人民的觉悟，动员亚非人民起来同帝国主义及其走狗进行更坚决的斗争。美国中央情报局策划印度尼西亚反动军事政变，激起了全世界进步舆论的严厉谴责。越南《学习》杂志指出，“美帝国主义和印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的反革命行动并不能说明他们强大。从世界范围来看，这只不过是美帝国主义长久以来遭到进攻和失败的全部处境中的部分的反扑而已。”坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》的评论说，印度尼西亚和一切发展中的国家的历史表明，“最后取得胜利的将是人民，而被打败的是帝国主义者。”帝国主义在加纳和其他几个非洲国家策动反动政变，同样激起了非洲人民新的反帝风暴。几内亚首都科纳克里举行了七万人的群众集会，与会群众高喊“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒新殖民主义”等口号。马里首都巴马科数千名工人举行示威游行，他们振臂高呼：“不要帝国主义，不要新老殖民主义，要真正的独立、要非洲的尊严！”
    亚非人民从帝国主义的疯狂反扑中更清楚地认识到，以美国为首的帝国主义仍然是他们的死敌。几内亚《自由报》说得好，“帝国主义屠杀我们各国人民，正是在自掘坟墓，是促使在非洲大陆上酝酿一场新的革命风暴。”（附图片）
