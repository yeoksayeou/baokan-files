The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently held a full army creative work conference in Beijing amidst the surging waves of the nationwide proletarian cultural revolution.

This conference was held under the personal care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the Military Commission, Comrade Lin Biao, and the Party Committee of the General Political Department.

The conference was held under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking Mao Zedong's works as the highest directive, and placing class struggle as the key. The conference aimed to smash the bourgeois black line and establish the proletarian red line. This conference was filled with sharp and intense class struggle. Participants not only fought against the "Three Families and Four Shops" and other black gangs outside the conference, but also fought against the bourgeois representatives within the conference and their own erroneous thoughts. Attendees believed that this conference was a conference to emphasize politics, a conference to actively study and apply Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, a conference to smash and establish, a mobilization conference for the socialist cultural revolution, and a conference to engage in class struggle and revolution. This conference has significant historical importance for the construction of cultural and artistic work in our army.

Through watching films and criticizing anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, the conference raised everyone's awareness and sharpened their eyes, making them realize the serious harm of the black line's rule on the literary and artistic front. These poisonous weeds are products controlled and influenced by this black line. Some works distort historical facts, do not reflect the correct line, and only write about the wrong line; they do not write about heroes, but only about mediocre characters, who are actually backward characters; they do not expose the reactionary class nature of the enemy's exploitation and oppression of the people, and even beautify the enemy. Some works depict revolutionary soldiers as "gangsters," full of rogue spirit; they even confuse the nature of just and unjust wars, exaggerate the horror and suffering of war, propagate bourgeois pacifism and the "philosophy of survival," advocate the "theory of class reconciliation" and bourgeois "humanism," and maliciously attack the socialist system, the Party's leadership, and defame Party cadres and revolutionary masses, etc. The emergence of these poisonous weeds is the result of the bourgeois literary and artistic black line's rule on the ideological and cultural front, which meets the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies and paves the way for the restoration of capitalism.

Through the exposure and criticism of the anti-party and anti-socialist bourgeois literary and artistic black line, everyone realized that the root of the black line is those so-called "experts," "authorities," "old heads," and "ancestors" of the 1930s literature, and those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party. They control many leading departments on the ideological and cultural front, giving the green light to poisonous weeds and engaging in anti-party and anti-socialist evil activities, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Our struggle against them is a life-and-death class struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the proletarian counter-restoration. We must thoroughly eliminate our superstitions about them, expose their reactionary faces, and smash their arrogant attacks.

Through studying Chairman Mao's works and relevant documents from the Central Committee, everyone has a clearer understanding that our army's cultural work has a glorious revolutionary tradition, running through a red line of Mao Zedong Thought. As early as the resolution of the Gutian Conference, Chairman Mao pointed out the correct direction for our army's cultural work. During the Land Revolution War, the Red Army propaganda teams played a significant role in the political and ideological work of the troops and in mobilizing the masses. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" most comprehensively, systematically, and thoroughly expounded the proletarian literary and artistic line, inheriting and developing the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the cultural work of the troops adhered to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the revolutionary war, combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and practicing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Red Army propaganda teams.

After the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao published "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," which are the latest summaries of the historical experience of revolutionary thought and literary movements in our country and other countries, and the new development of contemporary Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory. This has given our army's literary and artistic work a clearer direction in the new historical period. Over the past sixteen years, Chairman Mao has personally directed the anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement in the literary and artistic circles, issuing many directives to the literary and artistic circles. Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned us not to forget class struggle and to be vigilant against the class enemies using literature and art as a weapon to plot counter-revolutionary restoration. The resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960 "On Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" and Comrade Lin Biao's directives on the army's literary and artistic work in 1964, based on Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and Chairman Mao's directives, clearly defined the tasks of army cultural work in the new historical period on the basis of summing up the experience of the army's literary and artistic work. This year, under the personal care of Chairman Mao and the direct guidance of Comrade Lin Biao, the army's literary and artistic work symposium was held, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions of the cultural revolution in the socialist period, which has not only great practical significance but also far-reaching historical significance. This is a Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought red line in our army's cultural work.

Under the guidance of this red line, our army's cultural work has played an important role in political and ideological work and in consolidating and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops in history. Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the Military Commission, most of the army's literary and artistic workers have emphasized politics, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, gone deep into the companies, villages, and factories, actively participated in the socialist education movement, combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, strengthened tempering, transformed their thoughts, and improved proletarian awareness; they have created relatively good plays such as "The Sentinel Under the Neon Lights" and "The Great Wall of the South Sea," relatively good novels such as "The Song of Ou Yanghai," and some relatively good reportage, soldier poetry, music, dance, and fine arts works; they have also produced advanced units such as the naval cultural work team of the Guangzhou troops and the coastal defense cultural troupe of the Nanjing troops. In the army, there have also appeared many excellent amateur performance teams and singing groups. Especially, the large number of poems published by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers on wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers have marked a completely new era in both content and form.

Attendees deeply felt that the army does not live in a vacuum, and the class struggle on the ideological and cultural front will inevitably be reflected in our troops. The black line on the entire literary and artistic front will inevitably use various means to influence and control the troops. However, external factors are conditions, and internal factors are the basis. External factors take effect through internal factors. Over the past decade, in our army's literary and artistic work, there has also been a sharp struggle between the red line and the black line, a sharp struggle between infiltration and counter-infiltration, change and counter-change, control and counter-control. In this struggle, the majority of comrades have stood on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line and have resolutely carried out and implemented Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the directives of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao. Only a small number of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into our army once controlled some of our cultural departments. They used their power to spread a large amount of bourgeois, revisionist, and 1930s literary and artistic thought poison in the army's literary and artistic work. They arrogantly promoted bourgeois "liberalization," opposed the Party's leadership; advocated the idea of fame and fortune, opposed ideological reform, opposed serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; praised the literature of the 18th and 19th-century foreign bourgeoisie, praised emperors, generals, talents, and beauties, and so-called 1930s literature, praised revisionist literature, praised so-called 1930s representatives, and belittled, resisted, and opposed Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. Their bourgeois counter-revolutionary literary and artistic line has greatly damaged the fine tradition of the army's literary and artistic work and seriously corroded the combat effectiveness of the troops. Everyone agreed that this black line must be thoroughly eliminated, and the harm of the black line to the army's literary and artistic work must be thoroughly cleaned up.

The sharp and complex class struggle on the ideological and cultural front was also strongly reflected in the conference. The conference aimed to smash the bourgeois black line and establish the proletarian red line, but a small number of bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated into the army, such as Chen Qitong, "broke through the door" and viciously attacked Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian cultural revolution, and this revolutionary conference. Their anti-party and anti-socialist actions aroused the indignation of the majority of attendees and sparked a fierce struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought. Chen Qitong is a deputy director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department, a bourgeois representative hiding in our army, an extreme bourgeois individualist conspirator, a loyal inheritor of the bourgeois literary and artistic line of the former director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department, Chen Yi, and a vanguard of anti-party and anti-socialist actions. Exposing Chen Qitong and others is a victory for our army in the proletarian cultural revolution.

The majority of attendees, through actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and through the struggle to smash the black line, have raised their class awareness, strengthened their awareness of participating in the proletarian cultural revolution, and are determined to break with the black line and resolutely fight against the black line in the literary and artistic circles and their representatives in the troops. They must fight these bad elements to the point of exposing, overthrowing, and defeating them and must thoroughly eliminate the poison they have spread in the troops.

Attendees believed that to thoroughly eliminate the harm of the literary and artistic black line to the troops, during the proletarian cultural revolution, we must mobilize the masses to thoroughly clean up books, films, records, and performance programs in the troops. We must vigorously carry out mass cultural activities such as reading revolutionary books, singing revolutionary songs, performing revolutionary plays, telling revolutionary stories, watching revolutionary films, and listening to revolutionary broadcasts. This will enable the cultural work in the troops to play a greater role in emphasizing politics and promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts.

During the conference, attendees watched revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "The Red Cliff," revolutionary modern ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," and visited the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard." Everyone felt that these works are shining models of our socialist new literature and art, truly singing the praises of the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are epoch-making masterpieces that are deeply loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are the glorious victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We must seriously learn from these excellent works and dare to innovate and establish the spirit of socialism and the proletariat.

Attendees unanimously expressed that they would enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call and play an important role in this proletarian cultural revolution. They would follow Comrade Lin Biao's directives, actively participate in and strongly support the proletarian cultural revolution, stand in the forefront of the proletarian cultural revolution with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, and on the military and cultural fronts, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, thoroughly eliminate the anti-party and anti-socialist black line, smash all counter-revolutionary plots of capitalist restoration, defend the socialist system, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the conference ended, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, Comrade Liu Zhijian, spoke on behalf of the Party Committee of the General Political Department. Comrade Liu Zhijian expounded on the nature and great significance of the proletarian cultural revolution, deeply analyzed the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front in the army, proposed the tasks of the army in the proletarian cultural revolution, and called on everyone to actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution and strive to create socialist new literature and art.

When talking about the important role the PLA should play in the cultural revolution, Comrade Liu Zhijian pointed out: Our primary task is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize bourgeois thought, and resolutely fight against all bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. Chairman Mao is the founder of our Party, the great leader of our Party and state, and the teacher of the international proletarian revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, a universal truth proven by the practice of the Chinese revolution and world revolution, a beacon of human liberation, and the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people worldwide. Chairman Mao's books are the highest directives for all our work. We have always and will forever support Chairman Mao. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the whole Party will exterminate them, and the whole nation will condemn them. Comrade Liu Zhijian also emphasized that propagating or not propagating Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp class struggle. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, Marxism and revisionism. He called on the army's literary and artistic workers to definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. They must take studying, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their lifelong glorious combat mission.

Comrade Liu Zhijian pointed out in his speech that to propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, we must produce more good works and create good models. Good works are works that correctly propagate Mao Zedong Thought, works that are full of revolutionary passion, highly political, and have a high spirit. To produce good works, we must follow Comrade Lin Biao's directives, and the Party committees and political organs at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over cultural work, especially political leadership. Our authors must strive to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly make their thoughts, lives, and skills solid, and must adhere to the method of combining leadership, professionals, and the masses.

Comrade Liu Zhijian, on behalf of the Party Committee of the General Political Department, called on the whole army: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, create a strong political atmosphere, and fully mobilize revolutionary enthusiasm. We must follow the directives of the Party Central Committee, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget emphasizing politics, and never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must, together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, resolutely eliminate the bourgeois, revisionist, and so-called 1930s literary and artistic black line, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, firmly follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao, carry forward the fine tradition of our army's literary and artistic work, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

A total of 249 people from various units, including creative personnel and cultural work cadres, participated in this conference.

    解放军总政召开全军创作工作会议
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    坚决把文化大革命进行到底
    总政治部号召全军：一定要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。要同广大工农群众一道，坚决搞掉资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺的黑线，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，坚定不移地走毛主席所指引的道路，发扬解放军文艺工作的优良传统，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    新华社二十九日讯　在全国波澜壮阔、汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，中国人民解放军总政治部最近在北京召开了全军创作工作会议。
    这次会议，是在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，在军委、林彪同志和总政治部党委的直接领导下进行的。
    会议高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以毛主席著作为最高指示，以阶级斗争为纲，大破资产阶级黑线，大立无产阶级红线。这次会议充满着尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。参加会议的人员，既和会外的“三家村”、“四家店”等黑帮斗，也和会内的反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物斗，还和自己头脑里的错误思想斗。到会同志认为：这次会议，是突出政治的会，是活学活用毛泽东文艺思想的会，是大破大立的会，是社会主义文化大革命的动员大会，是一个搞阶级斗争、搞革命的大会。这次会议，对我军文化艺术工作的建设具有重大的历史意义。
    会议通过看影片和对反党反社会主义毒草的批判，提高了大家的觉悟，擦亮了大家的眼睛，认识了文艺战线上黑线专政的严重危害。大批毒草就是在这条黑线的控制和影响下的产物。有些作品，歪曲历史事实，不表现正确路线，专写错误路线；不写英雄人物，专写中间人物，实际上是落后人物；不暴露敌人剥削、压迫人民的反动阶级本质，甚至美化敌人。也有些作品，把革命战士写成“江湖好汉”，匪气十足；甚至混淆正义战争和非正义战争的性质，渲染战争的恐怖和苦难，宣传资产阶级和平主义和“活命哲学”，宣扬“阶级调和论”和资产阶级“人性论”，恶毒地攻击社会主义制度，攻击党的领导，丑化党的干部和革命群众等等。这些毒草的出笼，是反党反社会主义的资产阶级文艺黑线在思想、文化战线上实行专政的恶果，是适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，是为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的。
    会议通过对反党反社会主义的资产阶级文艺黑线的揭露和批判，使大家看清了：黑线的根子，就是那些所谓三十年代文艺的“专家”、“权威”、“老头子”、“祖师爷”，就是那些混进党内的资产阶级代表人物。他们把持着思想、文化战线上的许多领导部门，专给毒草开“绿灯”，进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，为资产阶级复辟作舆论准备。我们和他们进行的这场斗争，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的阶级大搏斗。我们一定要彻底破除对他们的迷信，揭穿他们反动的面目，粉碎他们的猖狂进攻。
    会议通过学习毛主席的著作和中央有关文件，大家更加清楚地认识到：我军的文化工作，有光荣的革命传统，贯串着一条毛泽东思想的红线。早在古田会议决议中，毛主席就给我军的文化工作指明了正确的方向。土地革命战争时期的红军宣传队，对部队的政治思想工作和宣传群众的工作，发挥了很大的作用。毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，最完整、最全面、最系统地论述了无产阶级的文艺路线，是马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的继承和发展。部队的文化工作在抗日战争、解放战争中，坚持为工农兵服务，为革命战争服务，和工农兵相结合，实践了毛主席的文艺路线，发扬了红军宣传队的光荣传统。　
    全国解放后，毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》两篇著作。这是我国和各国革命思想运动、文艺运动的历史经验的最新的总结，是当代马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的新发展。使我军的文艺工作在新的历史时期，有了更明确的方向。十六年来，毛主席还亲自指导了文艺界的反右派斗争和整风运动，对文艺界发出过多次指示。毛主席一再告诫我们，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，要警惕阶级敌人利用文艺这个武器搞反革命复辟的阴谋活动。一九六○年军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》和一九六四年林彪同志对部队文艺工作的指示，根据毛泽东文艺思想和毛主席的指示，在总结部队文艺工作经验的基础上，明确规定了在新的历史时期军队文化工作的任务。今年二月，在毛主席的亲切关怀和林彪同志直接指导下召开的部队文艺工作座谈会，用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。这就是我军文化工作的一条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的红线。
    在这条红线的指引下，我军文化工作在历史上对政治思想工作，对巩固和提高部队的战斗力，起过重要的作用。林彪同志主持军委工作以来，大多数部队文艺工作者突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，深入连队、农村和工厂，积极参加社会主义教育运动，和工农兵相结合，加强锻炼、改造思想，提高了无产阶级觉悟；创作了《霓虹灯下的哨兵》、《南海长城》等比较好的戏剧，《欧阳海之歌》等比较好的小说，还有一些比较好的报告文学、战士诗歌、音乐、舞蹈和美术作品；还出现了广州部队的海上文化工作队和南京部队的海防文工团等先进单位。在部队中还出现了许许多多优秀的业余演出队和演唱组。特别是广大指战员发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，无论内容和形式都划出了一个完全崭新的时代。
    到会同志深刻地体会到：军队不是生活在真空里，思想、文化战线上的阶级斗争，必然要反映到我们部队中来。整个文艺战线上的一条反党反社会主义的黑线，必然要采取各种办法来影响和控制部队。但是，外因是条件，内因是根据，外因通过内因起作用。十几年来，在我们部队的文艺工作中，同样贯串着红线与黑线的尖锐斗争，贯串着渗透与反渗透、演变与反演变、控制与反控制的尖锐斗争。在这一斗争中，大多数同志是站在毛主席的正确路线方面的，是坚决贯彻执行毛泽东文艺思想和军委、林彪同志的指示的。只有一小撮钻进我军内部的资产阶级代表人物，曾经一度专了我们某些文化部门的政。他们利用职权，在部队文艺工作中散布了大量的资产阶级、修正主义、三十年代文艺思想的毒素。他们狂妄地推行资产阶级“自由化”，反对党的领导；提倡成名成家思想，反对思想改造，反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对文艺工作者与工农兵相结合；吹捧十八、十九世纪外国资产阶级的文艺，吹捧帝王将相、才子佳人和所谓三十年代的文艺，吹捧修正主义的文艺，吹捧所谓三十年代的代表人物，贬低、抵制和反对毛泽东文艺思想。他们这一套资产阶级的反革命的文艺路线，对部队文艺工作的优良传统，起了很大的破坏作用，严重地腐蚀了部队的战斗力。大家一致认为：必须彻底搞掉这条黑线，彻底清除黑线对部队文艺工作的毒害。
    思想、文化战线上的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，在会议上也有强烈的反映。会议要大破资产阶级黑线，大立无产阶级红线，而陈其通等一小撮混进军队里的资产阶级代表人物，“破门而出”，对毛泽东思想，对无产阶级文化大革命，对这次革命的会议，进行了恶毒的攻击。他们的反党反社会主义的言行，激起了到会的绝大多数同志的愤慨，展开了一场捍卫毛泽东思想的激烈斗争。陈其通是总政治部文化部的一位副部长，是隐藏在我军内部的一个资产阶级代表人物，是一个极端的资产阶级个人主义的阴谋家，是前总政治部文化部部长陈沂这个右派分子的资产阶级文艺路线的忠实继承人，是反党反社会主义的急先锋。把陈其通等揪出来，是我军在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一个胜利。
    到会的绝大多数同志，通过活学活用毛主席著作，通过大破黑线的斗争，提高了阶级觉悟，增强了参加无产阶级文化大革命的自觉性，决心与黑线彻底决裂，决心对文艺界的黑线及其在部队中的代表人物，展开坚决的斗争。一定要把这些坏家伙斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，一定要把他们在部队中散布的毒素彻底肃清。
    到会同志认为，为了彻底肃清文艺黑线对部队的毒害，必须在无产阶级文化大革命中，放手发动群众，对部队中的图书、影片、唱片以及演出节目等进行彻底的清理。大力开展读革命书、唱革命歌、演革命戏、讲革命故事、看革命电影、听革命广播的群众性文化活动。使部队的文化工作，在突出政治，促进人的思想革命化方面，发挥更大的作用。
    会议期间，观摩了革命现代京剧《红灯记》、《沙家浜》，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》等优秀节目，还参观了泥塑《收租院》。大家感到：这些作品是我们社会主义新文艺的光辉样板，是真正歌颂工农兵英雄人物，为工农兵服务，深受工农兵欢迎的划时代的好作品，是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。我们要认真学习这些优秀作品敢于标社会主义之新、立无产阶级之异的革命精神。
    到会同志一致表示，我们一定要热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中起重要作用。一定要按照林彪同志的指示，积极参加，大力支持，和广大工农兵群众一起，站在无产阶级文化大革命的最前列，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一手拿枪，一手拿笔，在文武两条战线上，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，彻底搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线，粉碎一切资产阶级复辟的反革命阴谋，捍卫社会主义制度，捍卫无产阶级专政，捍卫毛泽东思想。
    会议结束前，总政治部副主任刘志坚同志代表总政治部党委向到会同志讲了话。刘志坚同志阐述了无产阶级文化大革命的性质和伟大意义，深刻地分析了军队中在文化战线上两条路线的斗争，提出了军队在无产阶级文化大革命中的任务，号召大家积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，努力创造社会主义新文艺。
    在谈到解放军要在文化大革命中起重要作用时，刘志坚同志指出：我们的首要任务，就是宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，彻底批判资产阶级思想，同一切资产阶级、修正主义思想进行坚决的斗争。毛主席是我们党的缔造者，是我们党和国家的伟大领袖，是国际无产阶级革命的导师。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是为中国革命和世界革命的实践证明了的放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是人类解放的灯塔，是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳。毛主席的书就是我们各项工作的最高指示。我们过去、现在和将来都永远拥护毛主席。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，全党共诛之，全国共讨之。刘志坚同志还强调指出，宣传不宣传毛泽东思想，是尖锐的阶级斗争。对毛泽东思想的态度，是革命和反革命，真革命和假革命，马克思主义和修正主义的分水岭，他号召部队文艺工作者一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。要把学习毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛泽东思想，当作自己毕生的光荣的战斗任务。
    刘志坚同志在讲话中指出，为了宣传好毛泽东思想，必须多出好作品，搞出好样板。好作品就是正确宣传毛泽东思想的作品，就是充满革命激情、非常政治化、调子很高昂的作品。要出好作品，必须按照林彪同志的指示，各级党委和政治机关，要进一步加强对文化工作的领导，特别是加强政治领导。我们的作者，要努力活学活用毛主席著作，真正做到思想、生活、技巧三过硬，要坚持采取领导、专业、群众三结合的方法。
    刘志坚同志代表总政治部党委号召全军：要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，把政治空气搞得浓浓的，把革命干劲鼓得足足的。我们一定要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我们要和广大工农群众一道，坚决搞掉资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺的黑线，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，坚定不移地走毛主席所指引的道路，发扬我军文艺工作的优良传统，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    参加这次会议的，有各单位的创作人员、文化工作干部共二百四十九人。
