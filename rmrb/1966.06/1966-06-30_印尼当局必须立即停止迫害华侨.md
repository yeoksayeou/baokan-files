The Indonesian authorities must immediately stop persecuting overseas Chinese.

On June 29, our government once again sent a note to the Indonesian government, demanding that negotiations be held immediately regarding the matter of the Chinese government sending ships to Indonesia to bring back overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland. The Indonesian government must give a clear and affirmative response to this immediately.

Since the Indonesian right-wing military clique launched a counter-revolutionary coup last October, they have been engaged in a large-scale anti-communist and anti-people campaign, massacring Indonesians while madly persecuting Chinese. The racist atrocities against overseas Chinese have swept across hundreds of towns and cities on the large and small islands of Indonesia, and are becoming increasingly severe. The Chinese people cannot tolerate the atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing forces against our compatriots!

In the face of these bloody facts, the Indonesian government cannot cover up its crimes. However, the leader of the Indonesian right-wing military clique, Nasution, actually said, "What is happening in Indonesia now is not racism." This is utterly shameless! The atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against overseas Chinese are even worse than those of South African racists and can only be compared to those of Hitler's Nazis. Inciting racism is a typical fascist tactic. The Indonesian right-wing military clique, in addition to using racist sentiments to further plunder the property of overseas Chinese and further deteriorate relations between the two countries, also seeks to curry favor with American imperialism and divert the attention of the Indonesian people, in an attempt to consolidate their barefaced fascist counter-revolutionary dictatorship.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people deeply care about the plight of our compatriots residing in Indonesia and cannot ignore it. The Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Indonesian government, demanding an immediate halt to the persecution of overseas Chinese, but the Indonesian government has consistently ignored these demands. On April 12, the Chinese government again sent a note, demanding that the Indonesian government send ships to bring back the overseas Chinese who have applied to return to their homeland. The Indonesian government unreasonably rejected this, saying that Indonesia could not provide transportation. In this situation, in order to enable the persecuted overseas Chinese who have lost their means of livelihood to escape their suffering and return to the embrace of their homeland as soon as possible, on May 18, our government again proposed to the Indonesian government that the Chinese side would send ships to bring back the overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland. However, more than a month has passed, and the Indonesian government has intentionally delayed and refused to respond, which is utterly unreasonable and despicable. In fact, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are engaged in various conspiracies to obstruct the return of persecuted overseas Chinese to their homeland according to their own wishes. They spread rumors that the Chinese government's measures to bring back persecuted overseas Chinese "will not be very successful" because the overseas Chinese "do not want to return to their homeland." They fabricate lies that the Chinese embassy does not issue passports to returning overseas Chinese and that the possibility of overseas Chinese obtaining "permission" to reside in China is "very small." This is a blatant lie and a malicious attempt to sow discord between overseas Chinese and their homeland. The Chinese embassy in Indonesia receives applications from large numbers of persecuted overseas Chinese every day, who eagerly await the arrival of ships from their homeland to take them back. The Indonesian right-wing forces' extremely despicable tactics only expose their role as tools of imperialism in opposing China.

The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are also attempting to use the pretext of "investigation" to carry out new political persecution against overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland. They openly direct and utilize Kuomintang spy elements infiltrated among the overseas Chinese to carry out anti-China activities and plot to forcibly send overseas Chinese to Taiwan. This further exposes the Indonesian authorities' evil intentions of using the overseas Chinese issue to serve American imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and further reveal their fascist military dictatorship to the world.

The Chinese people deeply understand that the atrocities of brutally persecuting overseas Chinese are entirely the doing of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces and have nothing to do with the Indonesian people. Overseas Chinese have lived in friendship with the Indonesian people for generations and have formed a close bond. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people have together opposed imperialism and colonialism and have made contributions to the construction of the Indonesian Republic. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people share weal and woe and have a common destiny. A small clique of Indonesian right-wing elements attempt to use racist madness to destroy the deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, but this will never succeed.

We must warn the Indonesian government that it must immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese and genuinely guarantee the safety of their lives and property and their legitimate right to voluntarily return to their homeland. It must not delay any further in responding to the Chinese government's note and must quickly enter into negotiations on the issue of the Chinese side sending ships to bring back persecuted overseas Chinese to their homeland. The great Chinese people who have stood up are invincible. We will not tolerate the persecution of our compatriots. Today, the overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia have a powerful homeland to rely on. If the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces insist on their racist atrocities, the result will only be their own misfortune. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, there have always been people who want to act as anti-China "heroes." However, whoever opposes China will be isolated in their own country and isolated in the world. The Indonesian right-wing military clique that is rampantly anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese will also not be able to escape this law!

### 印尼当局必须立即停止迫害华侨

    印尼当局必须立即停止迫害华侨
    六月二十九日，我国政府再一次照会印度尼西亚政府，要求立即就中国政府派船前往印度尼西亚接回自愿返国的受害华侨事宜举行谈判。印度尼西亚政府必须对此立即作出明确和肯定的答复。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团自从去年十月发动反革命军事政变以来，在大肆反共反人民、血洗印度尼西亚的同时，疯狂地反华排华。迫害华侨的种族主义暴行，席卷印度尼西亚大小岛屿的数百个城镇，而且愈演愈烈。中国人民对印度尼西亚右派势力迫害侨胞的暴行，表示难以容忍的愤慨！
    在血淋淋的事实面前，印度尼西亚政府绝难掩盖自己的罪迹。可是印度尼西亚右派将领头子纳苏蒂安居然还说，“目前在印度尼西亚发生的不是种族主义”。这简直是无耻到了极点！印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的暴行，为南非的种族主义者所不及，只有当年的希特勒纳粹可以相比。煽动种族主义，这是一种典型的法西斯手段。印度尼西亚右派将领集团，除了利用种族主义情绪来进一步掠夺华侨的财产和进一步恶化两国关系之外，还借此讨好美帝国主义，并转移国内人民的视线，妄图巩固它们赤裸裸的法西斯反革命专政。
    中国政府和中国人民，深切关怀侨居印度尼西亚的同胞的处境，绝不能置之不顾。中国政府曾经一而再、再而三地多次向印度尼西亚政府提出抗议照会，要求立即停止迫害华侨的罪行，印度尼西亚政府却始终置之不理。四月十二日，中国政府再一次提出照会，要求印度尼西亚政府派船把申请回国的受害华侨送回祖国，印度尼西亚政府对此竟无理地拒绝接受，说什么印度尼西亚方面不可能提供交通工具。在这种情况下，为了使丧失生计的受害华侨早日脱离苦难，回到祖国的怀抱，五月十八日我国政府又向印度尼西亚政府提出，由中国方面自己派船接运自愿返国的受害华侨。但是，一个多月过去了，印度尼西亚政府却有意拖延，一直拒不答复，实在是毫不讲理，恶劣之极。事实上，印度尼西亚右派反动势力，正在进行种种阴谋活动，力图阻挠受害华侨根据他们自己的意愿返回祖国。他们散布流言，说什么中国采取接运受害华侨的措施，“不会很成功”，因为华侨“不愿意回国”。他们造谣说，中国大使馆不发给归国华侨“护照”，华侨获得在中国居住的“许可”的“可能性很小”。这是公开撒谎和恶毒地挑拨华侨同祖国的关系。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆天天都接到大批受害华侨要求回国的申请，他们以焦急的心情，期待着祖国派船去接他们。印度尼西亚右派这种极端卑劣的手段，徒然暴露了他们充当帝国主义反华工具的丑恶面目。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力还企图借“调查”之名，对要求归国的华侨进行新的政治迫害。它还公开指挥和利用潜伏在华侨中的蒋帮特务分子，大肆进行反华活动，策划把华侨强迫送到台湾去。这就进一步暴露了印度尼西亚当局利用华侨问题，为美帝国主义制造“两个中国”阴谋效劳的罪恶意图，进一步在全世界人民面前显出他们实行法西斯军事独裁的狰狞面目。
    中国人民深深懂得，残暴迫害华侨的罪行，完全是印度尼西亚右派反动势力干的，这同印度尼西亚人民毫无干系。华侨同印度尼西亚人民世世代代友好相处，结成了亲密的友谊。华侨和印度尼西亚人民曾经一起反对过帝国主义和殖民主义，一起为建设印度尼西亚共和国作出过贡献。华侨和印度尼西亚人民是共患难、同命运的。一小撮印度尼西亚右派分子企图借反华排华的种族主义狂来破坏中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚的友谊，这是永远也办不到的。
    我们要正告印度尼西亚政府，必须立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，切实保障华侨生命财产的安全和他们志愿返国的正当权利。必须不再拖延地答复中国政府的照会，迅速就中国方面派船接运受害华侨归国问题进行谈判。站起来了的、伟大的中国人民是不可欺侮的。我们绝不能容忍自己的侨胞横遭迫害。今天，居住在印度尼西亚的华侨有着强大的祖国作为靠山。印度尼西亚右派反动势力如果坚持它们的种族主义暴行，那么，结果只能是它们自己倒霉。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，总是有人要出来充当反华的“好汉”的。但是，谁反华，谁就在本国人民中遭到孤立，谁就在全世界人民中遭到孤立。猖狂反华、排华的印度尼西亚右派将领集团，也决不可能逃脱这个规律！
