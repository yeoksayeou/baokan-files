    The Sato government Intensifies Revival of Militarism
    Japan-U.S. Political Talks Plot Anti-China Conspiracy
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo) News from Tokyo: Japanese monopoly capital is forcing workers to accept militaristic training through various means.
    Some monopoly enterprises and the enterprises they control are forcing workers to participate in the "Self-Defense Forces" for short periods to receive militaristic training.
    An organization called the "Defense Roundtable Conference," jointly composed of senior personnel from the "Self-Defense Forces" and monopoly enterprises, recently decided that newly recruited employees of each company must first serve in the "Self-Defense Forces" for two to four years before they can be formally employed.
    At the same time, the "Self-Defense Forces" are actively expanding their power in educational institutions across Japan. In Yamanashi Prefecture, the "Self-Defense Forces" have begun recruiting personnel in approximately twenty middle schools. The "Self-Defense Forces" are also sending their fifteen- and sixteen-year-old recruits to some schools to "study," which is actually conducting militaristic propaganda and carrying out espionage activities against the student movement.
    (Xinhua News Agency Tokyo, 21st) The United States and Japan held three days of regular political talks in Tokyo and Hakone from the 18th to the 20th.
    During these talks, the U.S. and Japan focused on discussing issues such as "containing" China, strengthening the anti-communist and anti-China alliance in Asia, and the U.S.-Japan security system.
    Irwin, Acting Chairman of the Policy Planning Committee of the U.S. State Department, Berger, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Nobuhiko Ushiba, Councilor of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others attended the meeting.
    According to reports, as a concrete response from the Sato government to Johnson's and the U.S. State Department's repeated urging of Japan to expand its military and actively follow the U.S. in its aggression in Asia, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a document to the meeting entitled "Military Management and Security System Related to Preventing Nuclear Proliferation." The document proposed that Japan expand its "friendly relations" with neighboring anti-communist countries to the "field of security guarantees," that is, turn them into overt military alliances directed against China. The document also proposed establishing new specialized military institutions under the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" to achieve "joint training" and "joint defense" between the U.S. and Japanese armies.
    According to Japanese newspapers, the U.S. and Japan reached a consensus at the meeting, deciding to continue using the "important matter method" at the United Nations General Assembly this autumn to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. U.S. and Japanese officials also discussed further implementing Johnson's "Southeast Asia Aid Plan," establishing the "Asian Development Bank," aiding the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, and strengthening the anti-China and anti-communist alliance in Asia.
    Japanese newspapers believe that this Japan-U.S. political talk is actually a preparatory meeting for the Fifth Japan-U.S. Joint Committee on Trade and Economics, which will be held in Kyoto in July. It laid the groundwork for higher-level Japan-U.S. talks in July to take the same approach.

### 佐藤政府加紧复活军国主义  日美政治会谈策划反华阴谋

    佐藤政府加紧复活军国主义
    日美政治会谈策划反华阴谋
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本垄断资本正以各种方式，强迫工人接受军国主义训练。
    一些垄断企业和它们控制下的企业，正在迫使工人短期参加“自卫队”，以便接受军国主义训练。
    一个由“自卫队”和垄断企业的高级人员联合组成的名叫“防务座谈会”的组织最近还决定，各公司新招聘的雇员，必须先到“自卫队”服役两年到四年，然后才能正式录用。
    与此同时，“自卫队”正积极在日本全国的教育机构扩展它的力量。在山梨县，“自卫队”已开始在约二十所中学里招募人员。“自卫队”还派出它的十五岁和十六岁的新兵到一些学校里去“学习”，实际上是进行军国主义宣传，并对学生运动进行特务活动。
    新华社东京二十一日电　美国和日本从十八日到二十日在东京和箱根，举行了为期三天的定期政治会谈。
    美日双方在这次会谈中着重讨论了“遏制”中国、加强亚洲反共反华联盟和日美安全体制等问题。
    美国国务院政策计划委员会代理主席欧文、远东事务助理国务卿帮办伯杰，日本外务省（外交部）审议官牛场信彦等出席了这次会议。
    据报道，作为佐藤政府对约翰逊和美国国务院一再敦促日本扩充军备、积极追随美国侵略亚洲的具体回答，日本外务省提交会议的一项所谓“与防止核扩散有关的军备管理与安全体制”的文件中提出，日本要把同邻近的反共国家的“友好关系”，扩大到“安全保障领域”，也就是变成公然的针对中国的军事同盟。这个文件还提出在“日美安全条约”下，设立新的军事专门机构，以便实现日美军队的“共同训练”和“共同防卫”。
    据日本报纸报道，日美双方在这次会议上达成了一致见解，决定在今年秋天的联合国大会上，继续以“重要事项方式”，阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。美日负责官员还就进一步实现约翰逊的“东南亚援助计划”、建立“亚洲开发银行”、援助印度尼西亚右派军人政权、加强亚洲反华反共联盟问题进行了讨论。
    日本报纸认为，这次日美政治会谈，实际上是今年七月将在京都举行的第五次日美贸易及经济联合委员会的预备会议。它为七月的更高级日美会谈采取同一步调打下了基础。
