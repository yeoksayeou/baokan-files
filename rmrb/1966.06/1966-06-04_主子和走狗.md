    Masters and Running Dogs
    He Jiang
    A prominent phenomenon in current international politics is that the rule of the running dogs fostered by U.S. imperialism in various places is generally in a precarious and crumbling state. In the Dominican Republic, the U.S. running dogs have so far been unable to control the situation, and their position is on the verge of collapse. In the Congo (Leopoldville), the U.S. running dogs are frequently replaced, and the political situation is unstable. In South Vietnam, the U.S. running dogs have collapsed one after another, and the infighting between the running dogs has even developed to the point of armed conflict.
    What do the numerous crises facing the U.S. running dogs illustrate? It illustrates that the tide of national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is surging forward vigorously. It illustrates that U.S. imperialism's rule in these regions is declining and tottering. It illustrates that U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy of seeking world hegemony has suffered a severe setback and is heading towards complete collapse.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The largest imperialism in the world today is U.S. imperialism, which has its running dogs in many countries. The people supported by imperialism are precisely those despised by the broad masses of the people." U.S. imperialism is the world's largest breeder of running dogs. It has searched, supported, and fostered a large number of national scum in various parts of the world as tools for controlling the world, especially for carrying out aggression and expansion in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Under normal circumstances, the U.S. practice is to provide money and guns and use running dogs to suppress the local people's revolutionary movements, realizing its aggressive ambitions to occupy these regions. The U.S.'s wishful thinking is that it can manipulate from behind the scenes, both concealing its own aggressive face and achieving the goal of enslaving and exploiting the people of these regions. After World War II, U.S. imperialism fostered a group of running dogs in various places, extending its aggressive claws to every corner of the world. Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Said, Menderes, Batista, Trujillo, and Jiménez are such a group of loyal running dogs of U.S. imperialism.
    However, the development of things violated the subjective wishes of U.S. imperialism. The cruel rule of the U.S. and its running dogs forced the people to rise up in resistance. The struggle of the people of various countries against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs has gone through a process of practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding. Initially, the spearhead of the people's struggle often pointed to the rule of the running dogs. However, the ruthless fact is that the running dogs can be replaced, but the rule of imperialism remains the same. The revolutionary people have increasingly seen from the struggle that U.S. imperialism is the backer and breeder of the running dogs, and the most ferocious and main enemy of the people of various countries. To achieve victory in the struggle, it is necessary to oppose U.S. imperialism. This is a leap in understanding. With this leap, the revolutionary struggle of the people of various countries has entered a new stage.
    The rise of the anti-U.S. revolutionary storm, especially the raging flames of anti-U.S. armed struggle, has fundamentally shaken the ruling foundation of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The situation of great revolutionary development has forced U.S. imperialism from behind the scenes to the front stage. In order to maintain its colonial interests and aggressive positions, U.S. imperialism has had to come out in person, with bare arms. From behind the scenes to the front stage, from relying on running dogs to suppress to personally sending troops, this is a sign that the rule of U.S. imperialism is heading towards decline. The situation in the Dominican Republic is like this; the situation in South Vietnam is even more so.
    U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have a common counter-revolutionary interest in dealing with the revolutionary people. However, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, especially when the situation is very unfavorable for them and they are facing collapse, often quarrel and blame each other; moreover, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If a running dog has lost its usefulness, or even become a burden to U.S. imperialism in promoting its policy of aggression, U.S. imperialism will not hesitate to replace it with another running dog." This situation is most prominent in South Vietnam. The killing of the Ngo Dinh Diem brothers, the revolving door of South Vietnamese puppets, and the endless friction between master and servant have become scandals that have spread throughout the world.
    U.S. imperialism has always touted South Vietnam as its "testing ground." What is the result of this "test"? People see that it has invested more than 200,000 troops, tens of billions of U.S. dollars, and millions of tons of ammunition, and the result is: the rule of the running dogs is in imminent danger, and the American aggressors themselves are also mired in a quagmire from which they cannot extricate themselves. This eloquently shows that the more capital the U.S. invests in its running dogs, the more miserable it will fail in the end. This is a ruthless law that cannot be changed by the will of the Johnson clique and others.
    "To sweep away all pests, our force is irresistible." The day when the people of the world bury U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will not be far away.

    主子和走狗
    何江
    当前国际政治中的一个突出现象是，美帝国主义在各地豢养的走狗的统治，普遍处于风雨飘摇、朝不保夕的境地。在多米尼加，美国的走狗至今无法控制局势，地位岌岌可危。在刚果（利），美国的走狗频繁更迭，政局动荡不定。在南越，美国的走狗接连垮台，走狗之间的内讧，甚至发展到了火并的地步。
    美国走狗面临的重重危机，说明了什么呢？它说明，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动的浪潮汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。它说明，美帝国主义在这些地区的统治日薄西山，摇摇欲坠。它说明，美帝国主义独霸世界的反革命全球战略遭到严重的挫败，正在走向彻底的崩溃。
    毛泽东同志说：“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”美帝国主义是世界上最大的走狗豢养者。它在世界各地搜罗、扶植和豢养了一大批民族败类，作为它控制全世界，特别是对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲实行侵略和扩张的工具。在一般情况下，美国的做法是，它出钱出枪，通过走狗来镇压当地人民的革命运动，实现它霸占这些地区的侵略野心。美国的如意算盘是，它在后台操纵，既能掩盖自己的侵略面目，又能达到奴役和压榨这些地区人民的目的。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义在各地豢养了一批走狗，把侵略魔爪伸到世界各个角落。蒋介石、李承晚、赛义德、曼德列斯、巴蒂斯塔、特鲁希略、希门尼斯之流，就是这样一批美帝国主义的忠实走狗。
    但是，事物的发展违背了美帝国主义的主观愿望。美国及其走狗的残酷统治，迫使人民起来反抗。各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，经历了一个实践、认识、再实践、再认识的过程。起初，人民斗争的矛头往往指向走狗的统治。可是，无情的事实是，走狗可以换掉，帝国主义的统治依然如故。革命人民从斗争中日益看清，美帝国主义是走狗的靠山和豢养者，是各国人民最凶恶、最主要的敌人。要取得斗争的胜利，必须反对美帝国主义。这是认识上的一个飞跃。有了这个飞跃，就使各国人民的革命斗争进入了一个新的阶段。
    反美革命风暴的兴起，特别是反美武装斗争烈火的熊熊燃烧，从根本上动摇了美帝国主义及其走狗的统治基础。革命大发展的形势，把美帝国主义从幕后逼到前台。为了维护自己的殖民利益和侵略阵地，美帝国主义不得不亲自出马，赤膊上阵。从幕后到前台，从靠走狗镇压到亲自出兵，这是美帝国主义的统治走向没落的一个征兆。多米尼加的情况是如此；南越的情况更是如此。
    美帝国主义及其走狗，在对付革命人民这一点上，他们的反革命利益是一致的。但是，美帝国主义和它的走狗之间，特别是在形势对他们十分不利、面临崩溃的时候，经常会发生互相争吵，互相埋怨；而且，正象毛泽东同志所说的：“如果一条走狗已经丧失了它的作用，甚至成为美帝国主义推行侵略政策的累赘，美帝国主义是不惜换用另一条走狗的”。这种情况，在南越表现得最为突出。吴庭艳兄弟的被杀，南越傀儡走马灯式的更换，主奴之间层出不穷的摩擦，已成为传遍全世界的丑闻。
    美帝国主义一向把南越吹嘘为自己的“试验场”。这个“试验”的结果怎么样呢？人们看到，它投入了二十几万兵力，几百亿美元，成百万吨的军火，结果是：走狗的统治岌岌可危，美国侵略者自己也陷入了难以自拔的泥坑。这雄辩地说明，美国对走狗投下的本钱越大，到头来，只能是失败得越惨。这是一条不以约翰逊之流意志为转移的无情的规律。
    “要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌”。世界人民把美帝国主义及其走狗通通埋葬掉的日子不会很长了。
