    淮北洪庄煤矿建成一对大型竖井
    淮北洪庄煤矿新建的大型竖井已在最近正式投入生产。
    这对新矿井是我国自己设计、自己施工、自己制造和安装设备的。它是淮北煤矿从一九五八年大跃进以来建成的第九对矿井。
    这对矿井的机器设备，绝大部分都是集中控制、远距离操作，具有较高的现代化水平。
    在这对大矿井的建设中，华东煤炭基建公司专门成立了现场指挥部，运用毛泽东思想指挥施工，集中优势兵力打歼灭战。他们根据抓革命促生产、抓革命促建设的精神，大力突出政治，组织广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，使职工们认识到自己是为中国革命而建设，为世界革命而建设，促进了建井队伍的思想革命化，战胜了重重困难。
