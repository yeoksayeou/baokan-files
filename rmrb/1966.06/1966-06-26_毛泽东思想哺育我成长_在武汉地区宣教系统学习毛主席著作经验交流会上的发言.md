	Mao Zedong Thought Nurtured My Growth
	--- Speech at the Experience Exchange Meeting on Studying Chairman Mao's Works in the Propaganda and Education System of Wuhan Region
	Wuhan City Acrobatic Troupe Performer Xià Jūhuā
	
	Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Be a Proletarian Art Warrior
	
	Before liberation, I was a poor child. My original surname was Xu. When I was five years old (in 1942), my father fled to avoid being conscripted by the Kuomintang and joined a performing troupe in our hometown. My family couldn't support me, so they sent me to the Xia family as an adopted daughter. From then on, I changed my surname to Xia.
	
	In the old society, performers were looked down upon and were considered third-class citizens. Life was uncertain, and we wandered from place to place. Life was hard enough, but even more painful was the spiritual abuse from the boss. In the old society where people exploited people, the relationship between the boss and the performers was one of oppression and exploitation.
	
	After liberation, under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, we acrobats no longer wandered aimlessly, and our lives were secured. However, in the early years after liberation, although I joined a state-owned troupe, I was still constrained by the family troupe. My entire monthly salary was handed over to the Xia family, and they only gave me five fen or at most one jiao for breakfast. They feared that I would raise my class consciousness and no longer be willing to endure their oppression and exploitation, so they locked me in the room after each performance, preventing me from contacting new things and attending literacy classes. However, the leaders and comrades cared for me greatly and helped me in my thoughts. Gradually, I began to understand some revolutionary principles and understand why the poor were oppressed and exploited. From then on, I decided to follow the Party and follow Chairman Mao.
	
	I love the new society and Chairman Mao. In the early days of liberation, when I was still a semi-literate with little education, I developed a fondness for Chairman Mao's works. I thought: Chairman Mao is so great, leading the Chinese people to stand up, we should listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books well. Some people said that Chairman Mao's books are profound and only those with high culture can learn them. Some said that Chairman Mao's philosophical works are very profound and even more difficult to understand. I didn't care about these. Seeing that everyone in the literary and artistic circles was studying "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I also found a copy to read. Some words were hard to recognize, so I asked others, but the principles in the book were easy to understand and very familiar. Chairman Mao's words touched my heart.
	
	Chairman Mao said: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns. But having only this kind of army is not enough. We also need a cultural army, which is an indispensable force for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." After reading this passage, I thought: I am an acrobat, also a member of this cultural army. The Party led the people of the whole country to overthrow the old society, and I was also saved from the sea of suffering. I not only should be grateful to the Party but, more importantly, I should consciously be a proletarian art warrior and contribute everything to the Party and the people. Thus, I began to understand the revolutionary significance of my work. People live not just to make a living, but to do their work well and serve the people wholeheartedly.
	
	In the autumn of 1958, with the help of the Party and comrades, I finally moved out of the Xia family and broke free from the constraints of the family troupe. When I left the Xia family, they still "negotiated" with me, asking me not to forget them after I left. I thought to myself: I will not forget the sufferings of the old society, nor will I forget your abuse and exploitation. The Party taught me how to be a person and for whom to serve. The Party taught me to serve the people better and be a strong revolutionary art warrior and a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, but you taught me to be an individualist, serving only your private interests and being a successor to the bourgeois cause. One path is the broad road of socialism, the other is the narrow path of capitalism. Which kind of person to be? Which path to take? I made up my mind: I want to be a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause and walk the broad road of socialism.
	
	Studying Chairman Mao's Books, Clarifying the Purpose of Practicing for Revolution
	
	After moving out of the Xia family, I have always lived with the troupe. The troupe is my home, and the Party is my mother. Under the Party's education, I understood that practicing for revolution is to serve the people better, and I had endless energy. In 1957, the Party sent me to participate in the World Youth Festival, and my "Plate Spinning" won a gold medal. That year, I was just twenty years old and didn't understand much, but I knew one thing: winning the gold medal was not my honor but the honor of the Party and the country. I should attribute it to the Party and the motherland. Without the Party and Chairman Mao's guidance, without New China, there would be no me today. Not to mention going abroad to participate in international competitions, I wouldn't even have the guarantee of food and clothing! Without New China, without the Party and Chairman Mao's leadership, what could I have achieved? Who would have looked up to me, this poor child? I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Modesty helps one to make progress; conceit makes one lag behind." In acrobatics, I had just started to learn to walk, and I couldn't be considered truly proficient. I had these thoughts, so my mind was more calm. I didn't attribute all the achievements to myself when I heard the leaders and comrades' praise. I saw that I still had many shortcomings and couldn't be conceited. Instead, I had to work harder and catch up.
	
	Under the Party and Chairman Mao's correct leadership, in 1958, the country saw an unprecedented great leap forward. People's communes were established in the countryside, and there was significant development in agriculture and industry. Our troupe also saw a great situation, with comrades full of enthusiasm and fighting spirit, determined to refresh old programs and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and the great leap forward. At that time, under the leadership of the Party branch, a special meeting was held to study, and each program had a new plan. I also wanted to practice new actions in the "Plate Spinning" program but was at a loss for a plan. At this time, a teacher in our troupe suggested practicing "Double Layer Double Swallow." This was a relatively difficult program. I had even been injured for this, but I didn't give up. Chairman Mao said: "We are doing a great and glorious business that our ancestors have never done. Our goal must be achieved. Our goal will definitely be achieved." Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, I finally mastered "Double Layer Double Swallow." I felt that there was still potential to be tapped, so I proposed higher requirements. After three or four months of hard practice, I completed the action of "Double Layer Double Swallow Hook Top."
	
	During the rehearsal, what force supported me to overcome various difficulties? It was Chairman Mao's "Moving Mountains" that gave me endless strength. I repeatedly studied this article and understood that no matter how great the difficulties, they could be overcome; no matter how high the mountains, they could be moved bit by bit. It was with this ideological motivation that in those years, I constantly set new goals for myself. As soon as I mastered a new action, I immediately practiced another new action, and the difficulty kept increasing, but I was full of confidence. During practice, the Party gave me great encouragement and care. Old artists also protected me during practice. In the past, practice was for the boss, and the boss used a whip to pressure, making one's mood uncomfortable and lacking energy. Now, practice is consciously for the revolution. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, thinking of the Party and the country, I would take out the spirit of moving mountains to practice. Even if my hands were numb from practice and my hands trembled when eating with chopsticks, I would still feel comfortable and full of energy, with endless energy.
	
	People's actions are always controlled by their thoughts. Technology relies on people, and people rely on thoughts. I had a deep understanding of this when practicing "Single Hand Top." It can be said that practicing "Single Hand Top" was not only about practicing skills but also about practicing thoughts. That year, my body gradually became fat. At that time, it was really hard to practice. Others saw me practicing so hard and advised me: "Give it up, practice something else! This is too much of a loss!" Some people even said: "If she succeeds, I'll write my name backwards!" Could it be practiced successfully? At this time, I brought this question back to repeatedly study "Moving Mountains." Chairman Mao said: "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Victory must be striven for by oneself, and revolutionary martyrs were not afraid of sacrificing their lives. What difficulties should I be afraid of? Victory will not come to you by itself, knocking on your door. This action was practiced late. Generally, performers practice this skill when they are young, but at that time, I was already twenty-three years old. Being older and heavier were unfavorable conditions. However, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and realized that as long as I listened to the Party's words and took out the spirit of moving mountains, what difficulties could block our way forward?
	
	At this time, I also studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao taught us: In any matter, if there are many contradictions, there must be one that is primary and plays a leading and decisive role. Based on this teaching, I further analyzed and clarified that the primary contradiction in practice was the contradiction between increasing age and increasing difficulty of actions. The way to solve this contradiction could only be to give full play to one's subjective initiative, seize time, and strive for victory. Once the primary contradiction was grasped, the greatest determination had to be made to solve the contradiction. For the revolution, for the improvement of acrobatics, I insisted on hard practice. On holidays, when others rested, I practiced; before and after performances, I practiced; even when my waist hurt, I insisted on practicing. I thought: With so many difficulties and unfavorable conditions, I should practice even harder; I should seize time and turn unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. "Practice makes perfect." Later, I indeed mastered "Single Hand Top."
	
	After mastering "Single Hand Top," I proposed a new action of "Foot Surface Holding Plate." This action had never been heard of or seen before. I thought that if the plate could come out from the foot, the skill would be complete. Chairman Mao said: "Dr. Norman Bethune was a doctor who took medical work as his profession and pursued excellence in technology." We should also pursue excellence in practicing programs and strive for better results. After I proposed this idea at the Art Committee meeting, some comrades disagreed. Some said: "A person's two feet are not as good as a person's two hands..." Some did not express their opinions. However, the branch secretary supported me, saying: "With determination and perseverance, it can be practiced." I then made up my mind to definitely master "Foot Surface Holding Plate." This action was relatively dangerous and difficult, and there was no one else's experience to learn from. It all depended on me to explore, so I not only had to make up my mind and overcome all difficulties but also had to have indomitable perseverance.
	
	At the beginning of practicing "Foot Surface Holding Plate," without experience, I broke some plates, feeling sorry, but later through failure, I found experience, and the plates were broken less. In July 1963, I tried a few performances in the People's Park. However, the first trial performance failed. I dropped the plate three times on stage, and several plates were broken. In the old society, if such a thing happened, the audience would make a fuss, and the performer would not be able to come down from the stage. However, this was in the new society. The audience was quiet, and everyone was secretly cheering for me. When I successfully performed the fourth time, the applause from the audience was even more enthusiastic than usual. The next day, I also received a letter from a stranger in the audience. He wrote in the letter: "Last night, when I saw you drop the plate three times, we all sweated for you. At that time, someone next to my seat said: 'Don't come again!', I said: 'She will come!'. Indeed, you performed again, and the fourth time you succeeded. Your firm willpower deeply educated me, I want to learn from you, wishing you continuous progress..."
	
	Later, "Plate Spinning" was also filmed, and some performers in domestic brother acrobatic troupes also practiced and mastered this action. I was happy that they mastered it so quickly.
	
	I felt that an actor, only when he clearly knows that he practices for the revolution, not for personal fame and gain, will he have true revolutionary willpower in climbing the artistic peak. Practicing for the revolution can achieve "overcoming all difficulties and striving for victory," and can listen to Chairman Mao's teachings. We actors practice and perform, only by letting politics lead business, and doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions, can we be proficient in technology and art. Since 1958, I have successively mastered actions such as "Double Layer Double Swallow Hook Top," "Water Holding Top," "Single Hand Top," and "Foot Surface Holding Plate," which are relatively difficult. This is entirely the result of reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Without the Party and Chairman Mao's guidance, I could not have succeeded in anything.
	
	Arming the Mind with Mao Zedong Thought, Bravely Overcoming Diseases
	
	In 1962, just after I mastered several new actions, I fell ill with a waist problem. The torment of the disease caused fluctuations in my thoughts. I thought that I had just mastered several new actions and just started to do something for the people, but I encountered such difficulties, and my heart was anxious. My waist is my main active part, and waist function is the basic function. Can I still perform in the future? Then, my legs also had problems, which further increased my mental burden. What should I do in the future? This question often appeared in my mind: Will I be paralyzed? Can I continue to work for the Party?
	
	At this time, I went to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress and saw our great leader Chairman Mao. For someone like me, who was oppressed and exploited in the old society, to be able to see our greatest leader, I didn't even dare to think about it in the past. Without the Party's cultivation, where would I be today? When Chairman Mao received us, he walked towards us with a benevolent smile and shook hands with each of us one by one. At this time, I carefully looked at him. He was full of vigor, with a radiant face. I thought: He is so healthy, which is the happiness of six hundred million people. Then, he also took a photo with us. I stood by his side, and my heart was beating so fast that it seemed to jump out. That day was the happiest day of my life, a day I will never forget. Chairman Mao gave me great encouragement and strength, and I decided to overcome the disease and work better for the Party.
	
	Back in Wuhan, I was hospitalized, and the provincial and municipal leaders and comrades all cared for me very much, often visiting me in the hospital. Some students and young pioneers also came to see me, singing and dancing for me. A student even sent me a book "The Daughter of the Army," hoping that I would fight against the disease like Hai Ying. The medical staff also took great care of me, doing everything possible.
	
	When my thoughts fluctuated due to the recurrence of the disease, I picked up Chairman Mao's works and drew spiritual strength from them to overcome the disease. At this time, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" the most. I used Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, serving the people wholeheartedly, "completely" and "thoroughly" to compare with myself, and I felt that I should not have any pessimistic thoughts. When a person encounters difficulties, he should see more light and have more courage. I compared myself with Chairman Mao's teachings: Do you see achievements and light? Do you have the courage to overcome the disease? You should have the courage! You should have the revolutionary spirit of optimism. After listening to Chairman Mao's words, my thoughts changed. I felt: Being sick is not terrible, but having a sick mind is terrible. No matter what, my mind should not be sick. I should be like Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune, a strong communist warrior, overcoming difficulties and enemies from all sides. I should strive to extend my stage life and invest my limited life into the endless service to the people. For the needs of the Party and the people, I bravely fought against the disease. In addition to drug treatment, I insisted on practicing in all possible situations. Finally, my body gradually returned to normal.
	
	This hospitalization, reading Chairman Mao's books, I deeply felt that whether facing difficulties or diseases, Mao Zedong Thought must be in command. The disease of the body is not terrible, but the disease of the mind is really terrible; overcoming the disease of the mind creates good conditions for overcoming the disease of the body. I deeply felt that whether facing difficulties or diseases, Mao Zedong Thought must be in command.
	
	Unite Comrades with Mao Zedong Thought and Move Forward Together
	
	Soon after being discharged from the hospital, I went to France, Italy, Switzerland, and other Western capitalist countries with the acrobatic troupe for a visit and performance.
	
	This time, we went abroad with fifty-one people, half of whom were members of the Communist Youth League, and I was responsible for the work of the Communist Youth League branch. At first, I had some fear of difficulties, and I had little experience in doing political and ideological work. Could I complete the tasks assigned by the leadership? I brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, enjoyments should be left to others, and burdens should be taken by oneself. Such comrades are good comrades. I thought, taking on the work of the Communist Youth League branch is a heavy burden for me. Listening to Chairman Mao's words, I should take this burden bravely and not be timid in the face of difficulties.
	
	First, I considered helping the leadership do a good job in political and ideological work. Among countless things, the first thing is to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works. Only when political and ideological work is done well can the task of going abroad to visit and perform be fundamentally guaranteed.
	
	How did we organize the study of Chairman Mao's works abroad? In response to the complex environment, we adopted flexible and diverse methods. The environment did not allow us to bring many of Chairman Mao's works, nor did it allow us to gather many people to study together. We took advantage of the gaps in performances, copied Chairman Mao's quotations on paper, and studied them during meals or while riding in cars. Foreign women are used to carrying a handbag, inside which are lipsticks and rouge. We also carried a bag, but inside was a powerful ideological weapon - Chairman Mao's quotations. In this way, whenever we encountered problems, we would immediately consult Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, during the more than four months abroad, we used Mao Zedong Thought to overcome difficulties and resist the infiltration of bourgeois evil winds. For example, the first performance in Paris was on September 30th, and the dress rehearsal was on the 28th. The manager wanted to invite reporters to watch first, but part of the performers only arrived in Paris on the 27th. At the same time, the theater could only be used for two hours a day for rehearsal, and the rehearsal time was not sufficient. At that time, we had not practiced for about twenty days, because the props had left more than ten days earlier, and some young comrades were also performing for the first time abroad, feeling more nervous. The Communist Youth League branch, under the leadership of the Party organization, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations, strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties, making everyone establish the revolutionary courage to dare to struggle and dare to win. We finally successfully completed the first important performance abroad. To complete the performance task abroad, our time arrangement was very tight. Every time we changed places to perform, we had to spend several hours on the car, often arriving at the destination only in the afternoon, and then setting up the stage. Sometimes we didn't even have time to eat, and we performed in the evening. At this time, the Party organization and the Communist Youth League branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, "carrying forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." In our work, as long as Mao Zedong Thought was in command of everything, we could be invincible. This time, the successful completion of the task of going abroad to perform once again proved this point.
	
	In addition to ensuring the completion of the performance task, we also paid attention to doing political and ideological work in daily life. In response to young people's lack of deep understanding of the capitalist world, we organized everyone to visit and observe, not only to see the surface "prosperity" of the capitalist world but, more importantly, to see the rotten essence of capitalism. We went to see the slums of Paris, where poor laborers lacked clothes and food and could not make a living; some poor people could not even live in the slums and had to sleep on the streets at night; but what kind of life did the bourgeoisie live? In Paris, the rich loved to keep dogs, and some shops were specially for dogs, dog clothing stores, dog food stores... Through these stark contrasts, everyone understood that our socialist system is the most superior, and our happy life is the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country to struggle hard, and the result of countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificing their lives. Our happy life is hard to come by, and we should cherish it very much.
	
	This time, going abroad to visit and perform, under the leadership of the Party organization, highlighting politics, and actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, I paid attention to doing work from two aspects: first, helping comrades in political and ideological aspects, and second, setting an example with my actual actions.
	
	In the past, I did not pay much attention to political and ideological work, and I did not spend much effort on it, so I had few methods. There was a thought of being afraid of trouble and difficulties in doing political and ideological work, so the work was simple and impatient, and the effect was not good. The leadership and comrades had pointed out this shortcoming to me. This time, I brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." "Our cadres should care for every soldier, and all revolutionary comrades should care for, love, and help each other." These words seemed to be said for my thought problem, and I resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We had a young performer who had more personal thoughts, paid too much attention to personal life problems, lacked youthful vigor, and was not hardworking in practice and performance, always fearing that he would be injured. I had made some urgent demands on him and blamed him for being backward. In this way, I saw more of his negative side and less of his positive side. It was the lack of a dialectical view of one and two. Because of these "burdens" in my mind, I did not actively approach him in daily life. Chairman Mao said: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." I actively approached him according to Chairman Mao's instructions, had a heart-to-heart talk with him, and regarded him as a class brother from the heart. With class feelings, I gradually learned the methods of persuasion and encouragement to move forward. For example, I first cared for him in life, helped him solve some practical problems, and then enlightened him in thoughts, and studied "Serve the People" and related articles with him. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person's heart ache when thinking of them. Can we still not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" We read this passage together and thought and discussed it repeatedly, finally making his thoughts change, and his thoughts and work made great progress. He performed well this time and applied to join the Communist Youth League.
	
	When helping this comrade, I repeatedly studied "Serve the People," which also made me understand that caring for the progress of class brothers is a requirement of the revolution for me. In the past, I cared too little for the progress of class brothers, and I demanded too much and too urgently of them, not understanding that everyone's progress has a process, and I myself also gradually understood some revolutionary principles. In the past, comrades helped me progress so carefully and patiently, why was I so simple and impatient when helping backward comrades today? In the end, it was not only a matter of method but, fundamentally, a matter of class feelings and how to treat revolutionary comrades. One person is red, a little red, everyone is red, a red field; one flower cannot make a spring; a performance is not completed by the good performance of one person; socialist construction is not completed by the strength of one person. Revolution is not the business of a few people; the more advanced, the better; the backward, the better, the more advanced, the greater the revolutionary force.
	
	Doing political and ideological work requires both words and deeds, and deeds are more important than words. Chairman Mao said: "The vanguard and model role of Communist Party members is very important." Using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine myself, I felt that there were many shortcomings. Last time, when going abroad, something happened. Once, I criticized some comrades for not paying attention to life problems, going out without wearing socks, and I pointed out that this would affect the foreigners' view of us and create a bad impression. This was correct. However, another time, I was suddenly asked to go out to visit, and because the time was tight, it was troublesome to wear long stockings, which required time, so I didn't have time to wear them. This incident was seen by the comrades I criticized last time, and she was dissatisfied and deliberately took off her socks that were well worn. This incident gave me a deep lesson: what you demand of others, you must first do yourself, otherwise, your words will have no persuasive power. This time, the leadership asked me to take on the work of the Communist Youth League, and I paid special attention to this point, always demanding of myself to never leave the masses, "suffering before others and enjoying after others." In this way, not only did I unite with the young comrades and complete the performance task relatively well, but I also had a good influence on foreigners. They said that Chinese representatives (referring to National People's Congress representatives) still helped to move props and washed costumes with performers. This made foreigners realize that under the guidance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have such a noble spiritual outlook. Switzerland is famous for producing watches all over the world, and people from all countries go to Switzerland to buy watches. The streets of this country are full of watch shops, and the prices are also relatively cheap. My watch was already very old, and it was slow by ten minutes every day. Someone advised me to buy a new one, but I thought I couldn't do this. Our country can produce watches, and if I want to buy a watch, I should buy a domestically produced watch when I return home, which can save foreign exchange for the country. These thoughts were not just mine; many comrades in the troupe also thought this way. Because the whole team paid attention to highlighting politics and highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, although we were in the capitalist world at that time, we resisted the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. Going abroad to visit and perform is itself a sharp and complex class struggle, and Mao Zedong Thought is our most sharp weapon in this struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology; learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, we can always stand unshakable.
	
	Over the past decade, thanks to the Party's education and cultivation, and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I, a poor child who was oppressed and exploited in the old society, have grown into a glorious Communist Party member and a revolutionary art worker. All my achievements belong to the Party. The Party has sent me abroad eight times to perform for the people of seventeen countries, and the masses have elected me as a representative of the National People's Congress and a first-class advanced worker in Wuhan City. The honor and encouragement given to me by the Party and the people made me feel uneasy. A person without the Party and the people is a failure. If there were no Party and Mao Zedong Thought to nurture me and the help of the masses, what achievements could I have made? In fact, what I have done is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. I will definitely follow the Party's teachings: be modest and prudent, beware of arrogance and impatience, always highlight politics, repeatedly read Chairman Mao's books, honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times. I will wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people and the world revolution, stand on the stage, and look at the world. With heroes like Jiao Yulu, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande as examples, I will not seek fame or profit, not fear hardship or death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

    毛泽东思想哺育我成长
    ——在武汉地区宣教系统学习毛主席著作经验交流会上的发言
    武汉市杂技团演员　夏菊花
    听毛主席的话，做无产阶级文艺战士
    解放前，我是个苦孩子。我本来姓徐。五岁那年（一九四二年），父亲逃避国民党抓壮丁，投奔到我们家乡耍把戏的夏家班子；家里养不活我，把我送给了夏家作养女，从此，我就改姓夏。
    旧社会耍把戏的没有人看得起，真是低人三等。生活没有着落，四处流浪。生活苦不要说，更痛苦的是精神上受老板的虐待。在人吃人、人压迫人的旧社会，老板和伙计的关系也是压迫和被压迫、剥削和被剥削的关系。
    解放后，在党和毛主席的亲切关怀下，我们杂技艺人不再到处流浪，生活得到了保障。但是，解放头几年，我虽然参加了国营剧团，却处处还是受家庭班子的束缚。每月工资全部交给夏家，他们每天只给我五分、多则一角的过早钱。他们怕我提高了阶级觉悟，不再甘心忍受他们的压迫和剥削，每天演完戏就把我关在屋里，不让我接触新事物，不让我上识字班。可是领导上、同志们十分关心我，在思想上帮助我，我渐渐地懂得了一些革命道理，懂得了穷人为什么受压迫剥削。从那时起，我决心要跟党走，跟毛主席走。
    我热爱新社会，热爱毛主席。解放初期，我还是一个识字不多的半文盲时，就对毛主席著作有了感情。心里想：毛主席这样伟大，领导中国人民翻了身，我们就应该好好听毛主席的话，好好读毛主席的书。有人说毛主席的书道理很深，只有文化高的人才能学，有人说毛主席的哲学著作深奥得很，更加难懂。我不管这些，看到当时文艺界都在学《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，我也找来读。有些字不好认，就请教别人，但书里说的道理，我一读就感到好懂，而且很亲切。毛主席的书，字字句句都说到我的心坎上来了。
    毛主席说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”读了这段话，我就想：我是个杂技演员，也是这个文化军队的一员。党领导全国人民推翻了旧社会，我也从苦海中被拯救出来，我不仅要对党感恩，更重要的是要自觉地做一个无产阶级的文艺战士，要为党、为人民贡献出自己的一切。这样，我就开始懂得了工作的革命意义。人活着，不是为了混饭吃，而是要把自己的工作做好，好好地为人民服务。
    一九五八年的秋天，在党和同志们的帮助下，我终于搬出了夏家，摆脱了家庭班子的束缚。离开夏家时，他们还和我“谈判”，要我出去了不要忘了他们。我心里想：我不会忘掉旧社会的遭遇，也不会忘掉你们对我的虐待和剥削。党使我懂得了怎样做人，为谁服务。党教我更好地为人民服务，做坚强的革命文艺战士，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人，可他们教我做个人主义者，一心一意为他们的私利服务，做资产阶级事业的接班人。前一条是社会主义的阳关大道，后一条是资本主义的独木桥。究竟做哪种人？走哪条道路？我下定决心：要做无产阶级革命事业的接班人，要走社会主义的阳关大道。
    读毛主席的书，明确了练功为革命
    从夏家搬出来以后，我一直跟团部住在一起，团就是我的家，党就是我的母亲。在党的教育下，我明白了为革命而练节目，练节目的目的是为了更好地为人民服务，我就有着使不完的劲头。一九五七年，党派我参加世界青年联欢节，我表演的“顶碗”得到了金质奖章。那年，我刚好二十岁，并不懂得多少事情，但有一点我懂得，得了金质奖章这不是我的荣誉，这是党和国家的荣誉，应该归功于党和祖国。没有党和毛主席的教导，没有新中国，就没有我的今天，不要说到外国去参加国际比赛，就连吃饭穿衣的生活保障都没有哩！没有新中国，没有党和毛主席的领导，我自己能有什么出息？谁还看得起我这个苦孩子？我牢牢记住毛主席的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。在杂技艺术上我还刚刚开始学走路哩，还不能算真正过得硬。我有了这些想法，自己头脑就比较冷静，听了领导和同志们的表扬就不把成绩都算在自己身上，就看得见自己还有许许多多不足的地方，不但不能骄傲，还得继续努力，迎头赶上。
    在党和毛主席的正确领导下，一九五八年全国出现了空前的大跃进，农村成立了人民公社，工农业生产有很大的发展。我们团里也出现了一派大好形势，同志们都意气风发、斗志昂扬，要刷新原有的节目，为工农兵服务，为大跃进服务。当时在党支部领导下，专门开会作了研究，每个节目都订出了新的计划，我也想在“顶碗”这个节目上练出新的动作，但却苦于提不出方案来。这个时候，我们团里有一位老师，提出可以练“双层双飞燕”。这是一个比较难搞的节目。我还为此受过伤，可并没有灰心。毛主席说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我们的目的一定要达到。我们的目的一定能够达到。”在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，我终于练成了“双层双飞燕”。我觉得还有潜力可挖，于是又提出更高的要求，经过三、四个月的苦练，又完成“双层双飞燕拐子顶”的动作。
    在排练的过程中是什么力量支持着我战胜了种种困难呢？是毛主席的《愚公移山》给了我无穷的力量。我反复学习了这篇文章，懂得不管困难再大，总是可以战胜的；山再高，一点一点地挖，总可以挖掉。正是有了这样的思想动力，那几年我总不断向自己提出新的奋斗目标，刚练出一个新动作，我又接着练另一个新动作，而且难度越来越大，但我充满了信心。在练功的时候，党给我极大的鼓励、关怀。老艺人也保着我练。以前练功为老板，老板用鞭子压着，人的心情不舒畅，练功没有劲头。现在是自觉地为革命练功，想想过去，看看现在，想到党、想到国家，我就拿出愚公排除万难的精神来练功。就是练得手发痠，练得吃饭拿碗筷手都发抖，也心里舒畅，浑身是劲，劲儿怎么也用不完。
    人的行动总是受人的思想支配的。技术靠人，人靠思想。我在练“单手顶”的时候，对这点体会得特别深刻。可以说，练单手顶不仅是练技巧，更重要的是练了思想。那年，我身体渐渐在发胖。当时练起功来真是费劲极了。别人见我练得那样费劲，都劝我说：“算了吧，练别的也比这个合适呀！这太吃亏了！”也有人说：“她要练成了，把我的名字倒过来写！”能不能练得出来呢？这时我又带着这个问题反复学习《愚公移山》。毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”胜利总是要自己去争取的，革命先烈们牺牲生命都不怕，我还怕什么困难呢？胜利总是不会自己送上门，送到你手里来的。这个动作我练的时间是晚了一些，一般演员都在年幼的时候练这项功，可是这时我已经二十三岁了。岁数大，身体重，这些都是不利条件。但是，我想到毛主席的教导，认识到只要听党的话，拿出愚公精神来，有什么困难能够阻挡我们前进的脚步呢？
    这时候，我又学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》。毛主席教导我们：任何事情中，如有许多矛盾，其中必有一种是主要的，起着领导的决定作用。根据这个教导，我就进一步作了分析，明确了练功中主要矛盾是年龄越来越大和动作难度越来越大的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的办法只能是发挥自己最大的主观能动作用，争取时间，争取胜利。主要矛盾抓住了，就要下最大的决心努力来解决矛盾。为了革命，为了提高杂技艺术，我就坚持苦练。假日，别人休息了，我练；演出前后，我练；甚至连腰疼的时候，也坚持练。我心想：有这么多困难、不利条件，更要好好地苦练；要争取时间，化不利为有利。“功到自然成”。后来，果然练成了“单手顶”。
    单手顶练成，我又给自己提出练“脚面夹碗”的新动作。这个动作过去没有听人说过，也没有见人演过。我想，碗能从脚上出去，技术就全面了。毛主席说：“白求恩同志是个医生，他以医疗为职业，对技术精益求精”。我们练节目，也应该精益求精，好上加好。我在艺委会上把这个想法提出来后，有些同志表示不同意。有人说：“人的两只脚不如人的两只手……。”有些人不表示意见。可是支部书记支持我，他说：“有决心有毅力就可以练出来！”我就下定了最后的决心，一定要练成“脚面夹碗”。这个动作比较惊险，难度很大，又没有别人的经验可以借鉴，全靠自己去摸索，这就不仅要下定决心，排除万难，而且要有百折不挠的毅力。
    开始练脚面夹碗，没有经验，打破了一些碗，感到可惜，后来通过失败找到了经验，碗就打得少了。一九六三年七月，在民众乐园试演了几场。可是，第一场试演就失败了，我在舞台上失手三次，碗也打碎了几个。这种事情如果发生在旧社会，台下观众会起哄，台上的演员就下不了台。可是，这是在新社会。台下观众安安静静，大家在暗暗为我鼓劲。当我第四次演出成功的时候，台下的掌声比平常更热烈。第二天，我还接到一位陌生观众寄来的信，他在信里说：“昨晚，看到你接连三次失手的时候，我们都为你捏了把冷汗。当时我座位旁边有个人关切地说：‘别再来了吧！’，我说：‘她要来的！’果然，你又表演了，第四次终于成功了。你这种坚强的毅力深深教育了我，我要向你学习，祝你不断进步……。”
    以后，“顶碗”又拍成了电影，国内有些兄弟杂技团的演员也排练和掌握了这个动作，我为她们掌握得这么快而高兴。
    我体会到，一个演员，只有明确自己练功是为了革命，而不是为了个人名利，他在攀登艺术高峰上才会有真正的革命毅力。为革命而练功，才能做到“排除万难，去争取胜利”，才能听得进毛主席的教导。我们演员练功、演戏，只有用政治统帅业务，按毛主席的指示办事，才能在技术上过得硬、艺术上过得硬。我从一九五八年以来，先后练成了“双层双飞燕拐子顶”、“衔水转顶”、“单手顶”、“脚面夹碗”等难度较大的动作，完全是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事的结果。没有党和毛主席的教导，我什么事也不能做成功。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑，顽强地战胜疾病
    一九六二年，正当我练成了几个新动作以后，我就患了腰病。疾病的折磨，引起了我思想上的波动。我想到自己刚刚练成几个新动作，刚刚开始为人民做点事情，就遇到这样的困难，心里很着急。腰是我主要的活动部分，腰功又是基本功，今后还能演出吗？接着，腿也有了毛病，这就更加重了我的思想负担。今后怎么办呢？这样一个问题经常在我的思想上转：我会不会瘫痪？能不能继续为党工作呢？
    这个时候，我到北京开人代会，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。象我这样一个在旧社会受压迫、受剥削的苦孩子，能够见到我们最伟大的领袖，过去连想都不敢想的。不是党的培养，我哪有今天呢？毛主席接见我们时，带着慈祥的笑容向我们走过来，和我们一一握手。这时我仔细看着他老人家。他老人家神采奕奕，满面红光。我想：“他老人家这么健康，真是六亿人民的幸福。”接着，他老人家又和我们合拍了一张象。我站在他老人家的身旁，更是激动得心咚咚直跳，好象要跳出来似的。这一天，是我最幸福的一天，是我永远也不会忘记的一天。毛主席给了我巨大的鼓舞和力量，我决心战胜疾病，更好地为党工作。
    回到武汉，住进医院，省市领导和同志们都非常关心我，经常到医院探望我，还有一些学生、少先队员也来看我，给我唱歌跳舞。有一个学生还给我送来一本《军队的女儿》，希望我象海英那样顽强地和疾病作斗争。医护人员则更是精心为我治疗，可说是想尽了一切办法。
    当我的思想因病情反复而产生负担时，我就拿起毛主席著作，从毛主席著作里吸取战胜疾病的精神力量。这个时候，我学得最多的是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》。我把张思德、白求恩那种毫不利己、专门利人、“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务的精神用来对照自己，就感到自己不应该有任何悲观的思想情绪。一个人在困难的时候，越是要看到光明，要提高勇气。我拿毛主席的教导对照自己：你看到成绩、看到光明没有？有没有勇气去战胜疾病？应该拿出勇气来！应该有革命的乐观主义精神。听了毛主席的话，我思想上起了变化。我觉得：人病了不可怕，就怕思想病了。无论如何，我的思想不能有病。要象白求恩、张思德那样，做坚强的共产主义战士，战胜来自各方面的困难和敌人。我要尽最大努力争取延长自己的舞台寿命，把我有限的生命投入到无限的为人民服务之中去。为了党和人民的需要，我顽强地和疾病作斗争，除进行药物治疗外，还在一切可能的情况下坚持练功。终于我的身体慢慢恢复了正常。
    这次住院，读了毛主席的书，我深深体会到，无论是对待困难，还是对待疾病，都必须用毛泽东思想挂帅。身体上的病并不可怕，思想上的病才真正可怕；战胜了思想上的病，就给战胜身体上的病创造了良好的条件。我深深体会到，无论是对待困难，还是对待疾病，都必须用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    靠毛泽东思想团结同志共同前进
    出院不久，我就随杂技团到法国、意大利、瑞士等西欧资本主义国家访问演出。
    我们这次出国共五十一人，其中共青团员占一半，我担任共青团支部书记的职务。开初，我还有些畏难情绪，自己做政治思想工作的经验不多，能够完成领导上交给我的任务吗？我带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。我想，担任团支部书记，对我来说是一副重担子，听毛主席的话，就应该把这副担子勇敢地挑起来，决不能在困难面前畏畏缩缩。
    我首先考虑的是要协助领导做好政治思想工作，千条万条，抓好毛主席著作学习是第一条。只有政治思想工作做好了，才能从根本上保证出国访问演出任务的完成。
    在国外我们是怎样组织毛主席著作学习的呢？针对环境复杂的情况，我们采取灵活多样的方式。环境不允许我们多带毛主席著作，不允许集中很多人在一起学习，我们就利用演出的空隙，把毛主席的语录抄在纸片上，在吃饭或乘车时学。外国女人手里都习惯地提个皮包，里面装的是口红胭脂。我们手里也提一个包，可是里面装的是强有力的思想武器——毛主席语录。这样，每当遇到问题就立即向毛主席著作请教。因此，这次在国外四个多月，我们用毛泽东思想战胜了困难，抵制了资产阶级歪风邪气的侵蚀。如在巴黎的首场演出是九月三十日，二十八日要彩排，经理人要先请记者们看，可是一部分演员直到二十七日才抵巴黎。同时剧场每天只能有两小时用于排练，排练时间不充裕，这时我们已有二十来天没练功、没演出了，因为道具先走了十多天，加上有些小同志又是第一次出国，精神上比较紧张。团支部在党组织的领导下，组织大家学习毛主席语录，在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，使大家树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命勇气。我们终于胜利地完成了这次出国的第一场重要演出。为了完成在国外的演出任务，我们的时间安排得非常紧，每换一个地方演出，都要花几小时坐车，总要到下午三、四点钟才能到达，接着就要装台，有时饭也来不及吃，晚上就演出。每当这个时候，党组织和团支部就组织大家学习毛主席著作，“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”。在我们的工作中，只要毛泽东思想统帅了一切，就能无往而不胜，这次出国演出能胜利完成任务，再次证明了这点。
    突出政治，除了保证演出任务的完成，我们还注意了把政治思想工作做到日常生活中去。针对青年人对资本主义世界缺乏深刻认识这一点，我们组织大家进行参观访问，不仅要大家看到资本主义世界表面的“繁华”，更重要的是看到资本主义腐朽的本质。我们去看了巴黎的贫民窟，贫苦的劳动人民缺衣少食，日子过不下去；有的穷人连贫民窟也住不上，夜晚露宿在街头；可是，资产阶级过的是怎样的日子呢？巴黎的有钱人爱养狗，有些商店是专门为狗服务的，狗服装店，狗食品店……。通过这些鲜明的对比，使大家懂得我们的社会制度才是最优越的，而我们的幸福生活是共产党、毛主席领导全国人民艰苦奋斗得来的，是无数革命先烈抛头颅、洒热血换来的。我们的幸福生活得来不易，要十分珍惜。
    这次在国外访问演出，在党组织的领导下，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，我注意从两方面做工作：第一是从政治思想上帮助同志，第二是以身作则，注意以自己的实际行动作出样子来。
    以前，我不大注意做政治思想工作，在这方面花功夫少，因此办法也就不多。对做政治思想工作有怕麻烦怕困难的思想情绪，因此做起工作来简单急躁，收不到效果。领导上和同志们都给我指出过这方面的缺点。这次，我就带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”这些话就好象是针对我的思想问题说的，我坚决按照毛主席的指示去做。我们那里有个青年演员，个人杂念比较多，过多地考虑个人生活问题，缺乏青年人的朝气，工作不够艰苦，练功、演出总怕把自己摔伤了。我曾经对他有些过急的要求，埋怨他落后。这样，看他消极面就多些，看他积极面就少些。就是缺少一分为二的辩证观点。由于自己思想上有这些“包袱”，平日就不大主动接近他。毛主席说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”我按照毛主席的指示主动去接近他，找他谈心，从心里把他看作阶级兄弟。有了阶级感情，也就慢慢学会了说服的方法、鼓励他前进的方法。比如，我先从生活上关心他，帮助他解决一定的实际问题，然后从思想上去开导他，和他一起学习《为人民服务》和有关文章。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我们一起读了这段话就想、就议，反复读、反复议，终于使他思想发生了变化，思想、工作都有了很大的进步。他这次出国表现比较好，还申请入团。
    在帮助这个同志的时候，自己反复学习《为人民服务》，也使我自己懂得关心阶级弟兄的进步，是革命对我的要求。过去，自己对阶级弟兄进步关心是太不够了，对他们要求过高过急，不懂得每个人进步都要有个过程，自己不也是慢慢地才懂得一些革命道理的吗？过去，同志们在帮助我进步的时候那样细致耐心，为什么我今天帮助后进同志就那样简单急躁呢？说来说去，不仅是个方法问题，从根本上来说，还是个阶级感情问题，还是个如何对待革命同志的问题。一人红，红一点，大家红，红一片；一朵花扮不了一个春天；一个晚会演出，不是靠哪一个人的节目好就能完成；社会主义建设不是靠哪一个人的力量就可以建成。革命不是少数人的事，先进的更先进，落后的变好了、变先进了，革命的力量就越来越大了。
    做政治思想工作，需要言教，更要身教，身教重于言教。毛主席说：“共产党员的先锋作用和模范作用是十分重要的。”用毛主席的教导来对照检查自己，感到有许多不够的地方。上次出国曾经发生过这样一件事情。有一次，我批评了有些同志不大注意生活问题，出外不穿袜子，我指出这样做将影响外国人对我们的看法，造成不好的印象。这本来是对的。可是，另一次，忽然要我出外拜访，因为时间很紧，穿长丝袜很麻烦，需要时间，我没有来得及穿。这件事被上次我批评过的同志看到了，她感到不满意，故意把自己穿得好好的袜子脱下来了。这件事给我很深的教育：要求别人做到的事，自己必须首先做到，不然你的话就没有说服力。这次出国，领导上要我担任团的工作，我特别注意这点，总是要求自己事事处处不脱离群众，“吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。”这样就不仅团结了青年同志，较好地完成了演出任务，而且对外国人也产生了较好的影响。他们说，中国的议员（指全国人民代表大会代表）还和演员一起搬道具、自己洗彩衣。使外国人认识到我们中国人民在共产党和毛主席的教导下，有着多么高尚的精神面貌。瑞士是以产表闻名全世界的，各国人到瑞士就要买表。这个国家大街上到处都卖表，价钱也比较便宜。我的一只表已经很老了，每天要慢十几分钟，有人劝我买只新的，我认为不能这样做。我们的国家自己能够生产表，要买表，回国买国产表，可以为国家节约外汇。这些想法不是我一个人有，团里的不少同志都这样想。由于全体同志都注意突出政治，注意突出毛泽东思想，虽然当时我们身在资本主义世界，却抵制了资产阶级思想侵蚀。在国外访问演出，本身就是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，毛泽东思想是我们在这一场兴无灭资的斗争中最锐利的武器；学习和运用毛泽东思想，我们就能永远立于不败之地。
    十多年来，由于党的教育和培养，由于毛泽东思想的哺育，使我这个在旧社会受压迫、受剥削的苦孩子，成长为一个光荣的共产党员、革命的文艺工作者。我的一切都是属于党的。党先后派我八次出国，为十七个国家的人民演出，群众选我为全国人民代表大会代表、武汉市特等先进工作者。党和人民给我的荣誉和鼓励，使我深感不安。一个人离开党和人民是一事无成的。如果没有党和毛泽东思想的哺育和群众的帮助，我能做出什么成绩来呢？实际上我做的距离党和人民的要求还很远很远。我一定遵照党的教导：谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，处处事事注意突出政治，反反复复读毛主席的书，老老实实听毛主席的话，时时刻刻按毛主席的指示办事，一心一意做毛主席的好学生。全心全意地为中国人民服务、为世界革命服务，站在舞台上，眼望全世界。以焦裕禄、王杰、麦贤得等英雄人物为榜样，不图名，不图利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗奋勇前进！
