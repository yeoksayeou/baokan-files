    What is the Purpose of the "Three-Family Village" Gang Talking About Ghosts?
　　Wen Xingjun
    The inside story of the "Three-Family Village" black shop has been revealed, and the demons and monsters hidden in this black shop have also been dragged out one by one. Their anti-Party and anti-socialist true faces have been exposed in broad daylight and can no longer be concealed.
      "Three-Family Village" is a snake pit, hiding various poisonous snakes; "Three-Family Village" is also a ghost den, with all kinds of ghosts. Deng Tuo is the head of the ghosts, Wu Han is the vanguard of the ghosts, and Liao Mosha is the general of the ghosts. They are all demons who oppose the Party and socialism. These counter-revolutionary gangs have the souls of ghosts, wear human masks, speak ghostly words, do ghostly deeds, and engage in conspiracies and tricks.
    Clearly they are demons and monsters, yet they all pretend to be human, and unanimously tell ghost stories, swindling and deceiving everywhere, expressing their "misanthropy," that is, their anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments.
    Wu Han is definitely the vanguard; he has two articles specifically discussing ghosts, and they were published relatively early. One is "Humans and Ghosts," published on May 18, 1959, and the other is "More on Humans and Ghosts," published on January 30, 1961. Liao Mosha naturally didn't want to lag behind; he not only cheered loudly for the ghost opera "Li Huiniang," but also defended ghosts from a "theoretical" perspective, putting forward the notorious "There is No Harm in Ghosts" theory, published in the August 31, 1961, issue of the "Beijing Evening News." Less than three months later, he threw out "Fear of Ghosts' 'Humorous Remarks'," proposing to compile a "Collection of Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts." This article was published in the November 25, 1961, issue of "Frontline." This was one of the first batches of black goods to be put on the market after the "Three-Family Village" black shop officially opened for business. Deng Tuo, after all, is the head of the ghosts. He doesn't talk about ghosts as blatantly as Wu Han or Liao Mosha; but since he is the head of the ghosts, he can't avoid talking about ghosts, only he does so more cleverly and discreetly. Deng Tuo talks about ghosts under the title "Ancient Cartoons." This article was published in the November 2, 1961, issue of the "Beijing Evening News."
      Why were the "brothers" of "Three-Family Village" suddenly so interested in ghosts between 1959 and 1961? Why did they talk about ghosts so much? What ghostly intentions did they have?
          "Three-Family Village" Advocates for Ghosts
      The reason why the black gangs of "Three-Family Village" developed a strong interest in ghosts, and why they spoke about ghosts in unison, was to use ghost stories to discuss politics, and to advocate for class enemies at home and abroad.
    In August 1961, Meng Chao's "Li Huiniang" was released, and immediately many people praised it. For a time, on and off the stage, ghostly talk was rampant and arrogant. Liao Mosha, the "elder brother" of "Three-Family Village," was slightly different from the others (other cheerleaders). He not only shouted "This is a good play" and Li Huiniang is a "good ghost," but also provided a "theoretical" demonstration. His so-called "There is No Harm in Ghosts" theory was specifically aimed at clearing the way for the large-scale emergence of demons and monsters. Liao Mosha talked about ghost operas, advocating for "ghosts" to "appear several more times" on the stage, but as he himself said, "ghosts on the stage are merely images of rebellious thought," and the purpose is to have people in real life imitate this "spirit of resistance to oppression." The real life of our country is the increasingly consolidated development of the proletarian dictatorship. Who is resisting the proletarian dictatorship? It is all demons and monsters. Therefore, Liao Mosha cheered for the "ghosts" on stage, actually cheering for the demons and monsters in real life; he sang praises for the "spirit of resistance to oppression" of ghosts on stage, actually encouraging the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists; he suggested that the image of "good ghosts" on stage be portrayed as more "lovable," actually wanting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to disguise themselves when carrying out reactionary activities, not to show their true colors, so as to avoid being recognized by the people. Obviously, Liao Mosha's "There is No Harm in Ghosts" theory advocates for ghosts in all respects.
      Besides the "There is No Harm in Ghosts" theory, another masterpiece of "Three-Family Village" advocating for ghosts is "Fear of Ghosts' 'Humorous Remarks'," which is also a "famous work" of Liao Mosha. This large poisonous weed was thrown out on November 25, 1961, and was specifically directed against "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts." At the beginning, Liao Mosha said: "The Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has published a 'Collection of Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts.' This is certainly a good book. But now it seems that a single 'Collection of Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts' is not enough; we also need a 'Collection of Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts'." What's going on here? Why did Liao Mosha want to compile a "Collection of Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts" in opposition?
    This must be discussed in the context of the situation at the time. As everyone knows, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Literature edited "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" after the "People's Daily" re-published "Comrade Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." The preface of "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" clearly states: "Our purpose in compiling this booklet is not to use these stories about not being afraid of ghosts to explain the ancient materialism of our country. We mainly want to introduce these stories to readers as fables, as satirical stories. If one is timid and does not liberate one's mind, then people will also be afraid of non-existent ghosts and gods. If awareness is raised, superstition is broken, and the mind is liberated, then not only are ghosts and gods not to be feared, but also imperialism, reactionaries, revisionism, and all actually existing natural and man-made disasters are not to be feared for Marxists-Leninists, and can be defeated and overcome." That is to say, this book is a political reader promoting Mao Zedong Thought. Compiling "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts," advocating the spirit of not being afraid of ghosts, is to encourage the revolutionary fighting spirit and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, it is to advocate daring to struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and various reactionaries, it is to not be afraid of all the difficulties on the road ahead, and to dare to struggle against difficulties.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are frightening, but in reality they have no great strength. From a long-term point of view, the truly powerful forces do not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." ("Talk with the American Journalist Anna Louise Strong") This brilliant judgment of Chairman Mao armed the minds of the revolutionary people and became a powerful spiritual weapon for us to fight against enemies at home and abroad. This spiritual atomic bomb is what the enemy fears most. Imperialism fears this spiritual atomic bomb, and all demons and monsters fear this spiritual atomic bomb. The Institute of Literature compiled this "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" precisely because it wanted to do some work in promoting this great thought of Chairman Mao. After "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" was published in February 1961, it was immediately welcomed by the broad masses, and many comrades also wrote letters of encouragement, saying that this was a very meaningful work. The "Three-Family Village" black gang also clearly understood the intention of compiling this book and its major impact among the masses.
    It was precisely because the "brothers" of "Three-Family Village" understood the purpose of editing "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" that it aroused their deep hatred and panic. This is because the "Three-Family Village" gang was originally one of the "ghosts." They are the enemies of the people, the slaves of imperialism, the echoers of modern revisionism, and the agents of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We promote Mao Zedong Thought, promote the spirit of not being afraid of ghosts, and the demons of "Three-Family Village" feel it acutely. Because, if the revolutionary people rise up and dare to fight against ghosts, the anti-Party and anti-socialist ghost tricks of the "Three-Family Village" black shop will be shattered, and their lives will become difficult. If the revolutionary people rise up and dare to fight against all "ghosts," dare to fight against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, this will dig into the roots of "Three-Family Village." The guys in "Three-Family Village" also hate this especially. That is the real reason why the black gang members of "Three-Family Village" wanted to come out and sing a counter-melody, and to compile a "Collection of Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts."
    Compiling "Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" is to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. "Three-Family Village" wants to compile "Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts," which is to advocate for imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.
    Chairman Mao told us that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and the revolutionary people must dare to fight against them. "Three-Family Village" wants to disarm the revolutionary people, spreading the idea that "ghosts" are particularly "scary," capable of making people "panic-stricken," "horrified."
    We say that ghosts are not scary, while "Three-Family Village" says that ghosts are "scary." We say that the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of ghosts; "Three-Family Village" says that this is "empty talk," "people who claim to be unafraid of ghosts but are actually scared to death."
    We want to promote the spirit of not being afraid of ghosts, to increase the revolutionary people's morale, and to deflate the prestige of the reactionaries; "Three-Family Village" wants to increase the prestige of the reactionaries, and to make the revolutionary people "look ridiculous."
    We say that U.S. imperialism is nothing to be afraid of, and the atomic bomb is also a paper tiger. Khrushchevite revisionists say that U.S. imperialism has "nuclear teeth" that can "destroy" the entire earth, "wipe out entire countries"; "Three-Family Village" follows suit, saying that those who claim to be "usually unafraid of ghosts" are "boasting," are "reckless gamblers," are "stupid."
    Khrushchevite revisionists slander the revolutionary actions of revolutionary people who dare to fight against U.S. imperialism as "false revolution," "not believing in their own strength, fearing imperialism"; "Three-Family Village" says that those who claim to be unafraid of ghosts are the "ones who are really afraid of ghosts," are "harboring ulterior motives," and "have even forgotten whether their courage is big or small."
    In short, "Three-Family Village" advocates for ghosts in all respects, especially for U.S. imperialism and Khrushchevite revisionism. Khrushchevite revisionists are frightened by the "nuclear teeth" of U.S. imperialism, specializing in helping U.S. imperialism boast and scare people everywhere; "Three-Family Village" sings the same tune as Khrushchevite revisionists, and boasts for Khrushchevite revisionism.
    Legend has it that there is a kind of changgui ghost, which specializes in scouting for tigers, leading the way for tigers, and helping tigers to scare and eat people. Khrushchevite revisionists are foreign changgui ghosts who act as accomplices for the U.S. imperialist paper tiger; "Three-Family Village" is a Chinese-Western combined changgui ghost who acts as accomplices for class enemies at home and abroad. In short, Khrushchevite revisionists and the "Three-Family Village" black gang all play the role of accomplices for tigers.
        "Three-Family Village" Uses Ghosts to Criticize the Present
    Another purpose of the "Three-Family Village" black gang's discussion of "ghost stories" is to smear, vilify, and curse our great Party and our great people.
      The "Three-Family Village" gang all explicitly stated that they were discussing ghosts and telling ghost stories from a political perspective, and they all especially emphasized the point of "using ghosts to scold people." In his article "Fear of Ghosts' 'Humorous Remarks'," Liao Mosha openly called on today's "talented and ambitious people" to engage in "humorous remarks." What he called "humorous remarks" was to satirize "living people," that is, to curse our Party and the revolutionary masses, through the satire of "ghosts" or "people who are afraid of ghosts"; Wu Han also specifically emphasized that "through ghost stories to satirize...living people"; Deng Tuo said it even more clearly: "The satire of ghosts is actually the satire of people." The "satire of people" by "Three-Family Village" is the satire of the revolutionary people, is the satire and curse of our great Party, of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. In this regard, the three demons of "Three-Family Village" not only used a completely common language, but also closely cooperated, with a particularly concentrated target. Putting aside other things for the moment, let's first look at how the "Three-Family Village" black gang "satirized living people" in the month of November 1961, and where their spearhead was pointing.
    On November 10, 1961, with the opening gong and drum of "Three-Family Village," Deng Tuo threw out his "Great Empty Talk." He used the most vicious language to curse the judgment that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind as "great empty talk," as "clichés." Once the shopkeeper set the tone, the guys had to keep up closely. The "Frontline" published Liao Mosha's "Fear of Ghosts' 'Humorous Remarks'" on November 25. He used equally vicious language to curse our Party, curse the revolutionary people, saying that our not being afraid of ghosts is "boasting," "empty talk," and frantically clamored to make us "look ridiculous." Harboring deep class hatred, this reactionary wanted to compile a "Collection of Stories About Being Afraid of Ghosts," specifically "selecting some people who claim to be unafraid of ghosts but are actually scared to death, writing them into stories, in order to vividly depict their ridiculous appearance." The day after Liao Mosha uttered such a rant, Deng Tuo threw out his "Two Foreign Fables," and the center of discussion of these two "fables" was also to attack so-called "boasting." Saying that "even now, characters who brag like this can still be encountered anytime and anywhere." And fiercely shouting that "bragging swindlers will never be easily let go."
    Please note, readers, that these attacks and curses all occurred within half a month. Their topics were so compatible, their language was so consistent, and their targets were so concentrated. How could this be possible without leadership and organized cooperation, without careful planning? This vicious attack and curse on our Party and the revolutionary people was a completely premeditated step. On the one hand, it was to echo the anti-China clamor at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU held in October of the same year, launching a coordinated attack on us from within and without; at the same time, they were also closely centered on the conspiracy of right-leaning opportunists to plot a comeback, stepping up the creation of public opinion.
    In the writings of Wu Han, the vanguard of "Three-Family Village," using scolding ghosts as a cover, while actually insulting our Party and the revolutionary people, was very blatant and very vicious. On May 18, 1959, he published the article "Humans and Ghosts." In this article, he used the tone of the ghost in the story to scold: "I have been here for more than 30 years, and I have never seen a stubborn person like you, such a fool." This and Liao Mosha's scolding us as "stupid" in "Fear of Ghosts' 'Humorous Remarks'" were like wild roars from the same mouth. In particular, if we compare Wu Han's scolding of "stubborn people" here with his scolding of "you are self-righteous, refusing criticism," "your heart is confused," etc. in "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," published more than 20 days later (June 16, 1959), then who he was scolding as "stubborn people" is not very clear? Not only that, Wu Han, this consistently anti-communist and anti-people reactionary, also blatantly scolded in "Humans and Ghosts": "There are a small handful of living ghosts causing trouble, creating rumors, sowing discord, creating a tense situation, putting on a ghost pose, ghost prestige." Wu Han also proposed that for this kind of "ghost" who "creates a tense situation," it must be "exposed" so that "the ghost is isolated among the people, and it will not be able to do ghost tricks." Look, it's again "creating a tense situation," and again wanting to "isolate" them. Do we not often hear modern revisionists using such language to curse the Communist Party of China that dares to fight against U.S. imperialism? Obviously, Wu Han is using the name of scolding ghosts to actually scold the Party and the revolutionary people.
    At the same time, Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, also scolded such "ghosts" in "Ancient Cartoons": "Heavy head and light feet, especially large cheeks, seems to have a strong appetite, but his body is too small, and action is even more difficult, only to cry in vain." Who is this scolding again? Perhaps the "Three-Family Village" gang would quibble and say that we are scolding reactionaries at home and abroad, and not scolding the people. But, denying debts is not allowed. If they want to deny debts, then they must answer the following questions:
    First, Deng Tuo wants today's cartoonists to inherit the ancient "tradition" of using ghosts to scold people in "Ancient Cartoons," so that it can "play its role" "under today's historical conditions." What exactly does this mean? What kind of role should this "tradition" play today? Today is the era when the people are masters, it is a country of proletarian dictatorship, it is a firm revolutionary faction that opposes imperialism and opposes modern revisionism. Then, if the "living ghosts" you are scolding refer to U.S. imperialism and various reactionaries at home and abroad, can't you scold them openly? Why do you have to be sneaky, and why do you need to choose a "particularly implicit form of expression"? Are you afraid of "getting into trouble," afraid of "danger"? Could it be that in our country, scolding U.S. imperialism, scolding landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists is still "dangerous" and can still "get you into trouble"?
    Second, Wu Han also clearly wrote in "More on Humans and Ghosts": "Loving to talk about ghost stories, in essence, is still talking about human stories. And, talking about human affairs is sometimes not very convenient, easy to offend people. As for talking about ghosts, it is much more convenient. In any case, even if you say something wrong, there won't really be a ghost coming to settle accounts with you." We want to question Wu Han: If the ghosts you "Three-Family Village" are scolding refer to U.S. imperialism or "exploiting class elements," "counter-revolutionary elements," then what is "inconvenient"? Afraid of "offending" whom? Afraid of whom coming to "settle accounts" with you?
    The fox's tail will always be revealed. No matter how the main generals and vanguards of "Three-Family Village" try to cover up, no matter what conspiracies and tricks you play, the result can only be to be clever but get into trouble, trying to cover up only makes it more obvious.
                        ×　×　×
    To sum up, the purpose of the "Three-Family Village" black shop's so blatantly discussing politics with ghosts is nothing more than one "advocacy" and one "curse." They advocate for ghosts, attempting to fuel the counter-revolutionary arrogance of class enemies at home and abroad, and to clear the way for capitalist restoration; they use ghosts to criticize the present, their spearhead directly pointing at our great Party Central Committee and our great Chairman Mao, attempting to drive our Communist Party off the stage. But the conspiracies of the "Three-Family Village" black gang will never succeed. We, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must hold high the demon-revealing mirror, and resolutely fight to the end to subdue and eliminate all local and foreign demons and monsters.

### “三家村”黑帮谈鬼的用意何在？

    “三家村”黑帮谈鬼的用意何在？
　　闻兴军
    “三家村”这个大黑店的内幕已经被揭露出来，隐藏在这个黑店中的牛鬼蛇神，也一一地被揪出来了。他们的反党反社会主义的真面目被暴露在光天化日之下，再也掩盖不住了。
      “三家村”是个蛇窟，其中隐藏着各种毒蛇；“三家村”又是个鬼窝，其中有各式各样的鬼。邓拓是个鬼头头，吴晗是个鬼先锋，廖沫沙是个鬼将军，他们都是反党反社会主义的魔鬼。这些反革命黑帮分子们，有着鬼的灵魂，披着人的画皮，说的是鬼话，做的是鬼事，搞的是阴谋诡计。
    分明是牛鬼蛇神，却都装成人的样子，并且异口同声地大讲鬼故事，到处招摇撞骗，抒发他们的“愤世嫉俗”，即反党反社会主义之情。
    吴晗到底是急先锋，他专谈鬼的文章就有两篇，而且时间也较早。一篇是《人和鬼》，发表于一九五九年五月十八日，另一篇是《再谈人和鬼》，发表于一九六一年一月三十日。廖沫沙自然不甘落后，他不仅为鬼戏《李慧娘》大声喝采，而且还从
  “理论”上为鬼辩护，提出了臭名昭著的《有鬼无害论》，发表于一九六一年八月三十一日的《北京晚报》上。之后不到三个月，他又抛出了《怕鬼的“雅谑”》，提出要编一本《怕鬼的故事》，这篇文章发表在一九六一年十一月二十五日出版的《前线》上。这是“三家村”黑店公开营业后，最先上市的黑货之一。邓拓，终究是个鬼头头，他不象吴晗或廖沫沙那样明目张胆地谈鬼；但他既是个鬼头头，也就不能不谈鬼，不过谈得更巧妙更隐蔽罢了。邓拓是在《古代的漫画》这样的题目下谈鬼的，此文发表在一九六一年十一月二日的《北京晚报》上。
      “三家村”的“老兄老弟”们，为什么在一九五九年到一九六一年期间，突然对鬼发生了这样大的兴趣呢？为什么这样大谈特谈起鬼来呢？他们到底安的是什么鬼心肠呢？
          “三家村”为鬼张目
      “三家村”的黑帮们之所以对鬼发生了浓厚的兴趣，之所以异口同声地谈鬼，其用心就是借鬼论政，为国内外的阶级敌人张目。
    一九六一年八月，孟超的《李慧娘》一出笼，立即有不少人为之捧场。一时台上台下，鬼话连篇，不可一世。“三家村”的“老兄”廖沫沙与众（其他捧场者）略有不同，他不仅大叫“这是一出好戏”、李慧娘是“好鬼”，而且能从“理论”上论证一番。他的所谓《有鬼无害论》，就是专门为牛鬼蛇神的大批出笼鸣锣开道的。廖沫沙谈的是鬼戏，主张让“鬼”在戏台上“多出现几次”，但正如他自己所说，“戏台上的鬼魂，不过是一种反抗思想的形象”，而其目的则是要现实生活中的人效法这种“反抗压迫的斗争精神”。我国的现实生活，就是无产阶级专政的日益巩固发展。谁反抗无产阶级专政呢？就是一切牛鬼蛇神。所以说，廖沫沙为舞台上的“鬼魂”叫好，实际上是为现实生活中的牛鬼蛇神叫好；他为戏台上鬼的“反抗压迫的斗争精神”唱赞歌，实际上是为地富反坏的反革命活动鼓劲；他建议把戏台上“好鬼”的形象演得更“可爱些”，实际就是要地富反坏分子在进行反动活动时，把自己装扮一下，不要原形上阵，免得为人民识破。显然，廖沫沙的《有鬼无害论》，就是从各个方面为鬼张目。
      “三家村”为鬼张目的杰作，除了《有鬼无害论》，还有《怕鬼的“雅谑”》，这也是廖沫沙的“名著”。这株大毒草是一九六一年十一月二十五日抛出来的，是专门针对《不怕鬼的故事》而发的。廖沫沙一开头就说：“中国科学院文学研究所出版过一本《不怕鬼的故事》。这当然是本好书。但是现在看来，单是一本《不怕鬼的故事》还不够用，还得有一本《怕鬼的故事》。”这是怎么一回事呢？为什么廖沫沙要针锋相对地编一本《怕鬼的故事》呢？
    这得从当时的情况谈起。大家知道，中国科学院文学研究所编辑《不怕鬼的故事》，是在《人民日报》重新发表了《毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎》之后。在《不怕鬼的故事》的序言中明明白白地写着：“我们编这个小册子，目的不在于借这些不怕鬼的故事来说明我国古代的唯物主义的思想。我们主要是想把这些故事当作寓言、当作讽谕性的故事来介绍给读者们。如果心存怯懦，思想不解放，那末人们对于并不存在的鬼神也会害怕。如果觉悟提高，迷信破除，思想解放，那末不但鬼神不可怕，而且帝国主义、反动派、修正主义，一切实际存在的天灾人祸，对于马克思列宁主义者来说，都是不可怕的，都是可以战胜的，都是可以克服的。”这就是说，该书是一本宣传毛泽东思想的政治读物。编《不怕鬼的故事》，提倡不怕鬼的精神，就是鼓舞我国人民的革命斗志和革命精神，就是要提倡敢于同帝国主义、修正主义和各种反动派作斗争，就是要不怕前进道路上的一切困难，敢于同困难作斗争。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”（《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》）毛主席这一英明的论断武装了革命人民的头脑，成为我们同国内外敌人作斗争时强大的精神武器。这个精神原子弹是敌人最害怕的。帝国主义害怕这个精神原子弹，一切牛鬼蛇神都害怕这个精神原子弹。文学研究所编这本《不怕鬼的故事》，也正是想在宣传毛主席的这一伟大思想这方面多少做些工作。《不怕鬼的故事》于一九六一年二月出版以后，立即受到广大群众的欢迎，许多同志还写信鼓励，说这是做了一件很有意义的工作。“三家村”的黑帮分子们对于编这本书的用意，和它在群众中的重大影响，也是清清楚楚的。
    正因为“三家村”的“老兄老弟”们明白编辑《不怕鬼的故事》的宗旨，所以也就引起了他们的刻骨仇恨和恐慌。这是因为，“三家村”一伙本来就是属于“鬼”的一类，他们是人民的敌人，是帝国主义的奴才，是现代修正主义的应声虫，是地富反坏的代理人。我们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传不怕鬼的精神，
  “三家村”的魔鬼们是有切肤之痛的。因为，革命人民起来敢于同鬼作斗争，“三家村”黑店所搞的反党反社会主义的鬼勾当，就会被粉碎，他们的日子就不好过了。革命人民起来敢于同一切“鬼”作斗争，敢于同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派作斗争，这就挖到“三家村”的老根上去了。对此，“三家村”的伙计们也是特别仇恨的。这就是为什么“三家村”的黑帮分子们要出来唱对台戏，要编一本《怕鬼的故事》的真正原因。
    编《不怕鬼的故事》，是要同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派作斗争。“三家村”要编《怕鬼的故事》，则是为帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派张目。
    毛主席告诉我们，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，革命人民要敢于同它们作斗争。“三家村”则要解除革命人民的武装，散布“鬼”特别“可怕”，可以使人“心惊胆裂”、“惊恐欲绝”。
    我们说鬼是不可怕的，“三家村”则说鬼是“可怕的”。我们说用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民是不怕鬼的；“三家村”则说这是“空口说大话”，是“口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得要死的人”。
    我们要发扬不怕鬼的精神，长革命人民的志气，灭反动派的威风；“三家村”则要长反动派的威风，要使革命人民“丑态百出”。
    我们说美帝国主义并没有什么可怕，原子弹也是纸老虎。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者则说美帝国主义有着“核牙齿”，可以把整个地球“毁灭”掉，“把整个整个的国家一扫而光”；“三家村”则跟着说：号称“素不畏鬼”的人是“口出大言”，是“顾前不顾后的赌棍”，是“愚蠢”。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者把革命人民敢于同美帝国主义作斗争的革命行动，诬蔑为“假革命”，“不相信自己的力量，害怕帝国主义”；“三家村”则说号称不怕鬼的人才是“真正怕鬼”，是“心里怀着鬼胎”，“就连自己的胆量究竟是大是小，也忘之脑后”了。
    总之，“三家村”是从各个方面为鬼张目，特别是为美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义张目。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者被美帝国主义的“核牙齿”吓破了胆，专门帮美帝国主义吹嘘，到处吓人；“三家村”完全同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者唱同样的调子，并且为赫鲁晓夫修正主义吹嘘。
    传说中有一种伥鬼，专门替老虎打探消息，给老虎引路，帮助老虎去吓人、吃人。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是为美帝国主义纸老虎作伥的洋伥鬼；“三家村”则是为国内外阶级敌人作伥的土洋结合的伥鬼。总之，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和“三家村”黑帮都充当了为虎作伥的角色。
        “三家村”借鬼骂今
    “三家村”黑帮谈论“鬼故事”的另一目的，就是污蔑、丑化和咒骂我们伟大的党和伟大的人民。
      “三家村”一伙都明确地说过，他们是从政治角度谈鬼、讲鬼故事的，并且都特别强调“借鬼骂人”这一点。廖沫沙在《怕鬼的“雅谑”》一文中，就曾公开号召“今日”的“有才有志之士”来“‘雅谑’一番”。他所谓的“‘雅谑’一番”，就是要通过对“鬼”或对“怕鬼的人”的讽刺，来讽刺“活着的人”，即咒骂我们的党和革命群众；吴晗也特别强调要“通过鬼的故事来讽刺……活着的人”；邓拓说得更明白：“对鬼的讽刺，实际上却是对人的讽刺。”“三家村”所谓的“对人的讽刺”，就是对革命人民的讽刺，就是对我们伟大的党、对以毛主席为首的党中央的讽刺和咒骂。在这方面，“三家村”三个魔鬼不仅完全使用着共同的语言，而且是紧密配合，目标特别集中。别的先不说，我们就先看看在一九六一年十一月这一个月的时间内，“三家村”黑帮是怎样“讽刺活人”的，他们的锋芒是指向哪里的。
    一九六一年十一月十日，在“三家村”的开场锣鼓中，邓拓就抛出了他的《伟大的空话》。他用最恶毒的语言咒骂关于东风压倒西风的论断是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”。掌柜的定了调子，伙计就要紧紧跟上。十一月二十五日出版的《前线》上，廖沫沙的《怕鬼的“雅谑”》登出来了。他用同样恶毒的语言咒骂我们党、咒骂革命人民，说我们不怕鬼是“口出大言”、“空口说大话”，并且疯狂地叫嚣要使我们“丑态百出”。这个反动分子怀着刻骨的阶级仇恨，要编一本《怕鬼的故事》，专门“挑选一些口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得要死的人，把他们写成故事，以便活现出他们的丑态百出”。就在廖沫沙发出如此狂吠的第二天，邓拓又抛出了他的《两则外国寓言》，这两则“寓言”议论的中心也是攻击所谓“说大话”。说什么“直到如今，这样吹牛的人物，随时随地都还可以遇见”。并且恶狠狠地喊叫“决不会轻易地放走吹牛的骗子”。
    请读者注意，这种种攻击和咒骂，都发生在半个月的时间内，他们的话题是如此相投，语言是那样一致，目标又是这样集中，如果不是有领导有组织的配合，如果没有精心的策划，这怎么可能呢？这种对我们党和革命人民的恶毒攻击和咒骂，完全是个预谋的步骤。他们一方面是为了与同年十月份召开的苏共二十二大上的反华叫嚣相呼应，对我们进行里应外合的袭击；同时他们又是紧紧地围绕着右倾机会主义分子图谋卷土重来的阴谋活动，加紧制造舆论。
    在“三家村”急先锋吴晗的笔下，以骂鬼为幌子，而实则辱骂我们的党、辱骂革命人民十分露骨，十分恶毒。一九五九年五月十八日他发表了《人和鬼》一文。在这篇文章中，他借用故事中鬼的口气骂道：“我在这儿三十多年了，从来没见过你这号顽固的人，这样蠢才。”这和廖沫沙在《怕鬼的“雅谑”》中骂我们“愚蠢”，象是由一个嘴巴里发出的狂吠。特别是，如果我们把吴晗在这里所骂的“顽固的人”，同他在二十多天后（一九五九年六月十六日）发表的《海瑞骂皇帝》中所骂的“你自以为是，拒绝批评”，“你的心迷惑了”等语言对照一下，那末，他所骂的“顽固的人”，究竟是在骂谁，不是很清楚吗？不仅如此，吴晗这个一贯反共反人民的反动分子，在《人和鬼》中，还明目张胆地骂过：“有那末一小撮活鬼在兴风作浪，造谣生事，播弄是非，造成紧张局势，摆出鬼架子，鬼威风”。吴晗同时提出，对于这种“造成紧张局势”的“鬼”，必须“揭穿”，使“鬼在人们中间孤立了，也就搞不成鬼玩意了”。看，又是“造成紧张局势”，又是要加以“孤立”，我们不是常听到现代修正主义者用这样的语言来咒骂敢于同美帝国主义作斗争的中国共产党吗？十分明显，吴晗是以骂鬼之名，行骂党骂革命人民之实。
    与此同时，“三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓，在《古代的漫画》中，还骂了这样的“鬼”：“头重脚轻，两腮特大，看来食欲很强烈，可是他的身子却太小，行动更困难，只能徒唤奈何”。这又是骂谁呢？也许“三家村”一伙会狡辩说，我们骂的都是国内外反动派，而并非是在骂人民。但是，赖账是不行的。如果他们想赖账，那他们就必须回答这样的问题：
    第一，邓拓在《古代的漫画》中，要今天的漫画家继承古代那种借鬼骂人的“传统”，使之“在今天的历史条件下”，“发挥它的作用”。这究竟是什么意思？要这种“传统”在今天发挥怎样的作用？我们今天是人民当家作主的时代，是无产阶级专政的国家，是反对帝国主义反对现代修正主义的坚定的革命派。那么，你们所骂的“活鬼”，如果是指帝国主义和国内外各种反动派，不是可以大张旗鼓地骂吗？何必偷偷摸摸，又何须去选择“特别含蓄的表现形式”？你们怕“惹祸”，怕出“危险”，难道在我们的国家里骂美帝国主义、骂地富反坏，还有“危险”，还能“惹祸”吗？
    第二，吴晗在《再谈人和鬼》中也明明白白地写道：“爱谈鬼故事，实质上谈的还是人的故事。并且，谈人的事有时候可能不是很方便，容易得罪人，至于谈鬼，那就方便多了，无论如何，即使说错了，也不至于真有鬼来和你算账。”我们要质问吴晗：你们“三家村”所骂的鬼，如果是指美帝国主义或“剥削阶级分子”、“反革命分子”的话，那又有什么“不方便”之处呢？怕“得罪”谁呢？怕谁来和你们“算账”呢？
    狐狸尾巴总是要露出来的。不管“三家村”的主将和先锋怎样遮遮掩掩，不管你们玩弄什么阴谋诡计，结果只能是弄巧成拙，欲盖弥彰。

    综上所述，“三家村”黑店如此放肆地以鬼论政的目的，无非是一“张”一“骂”。他们为鬼张目，企图助长国内外阶级敌人的反革命气焰，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道；他们借鬼骂今，矛头直接指向我们伟大的党中央和伟大的毛主席，企图把我们共产党赶下台。但是，“三家村”黑帮分子的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。我们为毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民一定要高举照妖镜，为制服和消灭一切土的洋的妖魔鬼怪而坚决斗争到底。
