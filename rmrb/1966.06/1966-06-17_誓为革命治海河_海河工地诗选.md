    Vow to Conquer the Hai River for the Revolution
    Hai River Construction Site Poem Selection
    The people of Hebei Province, responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "definitely harness the Hai River," continued to invest in the construction of the Heilonggang area this spring. The river-harnessing laborers and cadres worked selflessly on the construction site, taking Chairman Mao's call as their guide and creating many miracles. In their labor, they also picked up their pens and created many literary works, praising our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao. They are not only a production revolution army but also a cultural revolution army. This is a new revolutionary atmosphere emerging under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.　Editor
    Chairman Mao's Call Shakes Heaven and Earth
    Luo Jianguo
    On the Qingliang River,
        Red flags flutter,
        Beat the drums of war,
        Fight together.
    "We must harness the Hai River,"
        Resolutely conquer nature.
    Chairman Mao's call shakes heaven and earth,
        Heroes aspire to embroider the rivers and mountains.
    Hearts are fiery,
        Wills are stronger than stone,
        Unafraid of high cliffs and steep slopes,
        Unafraid of wind and cold weather.
        Spades and picks dance,
        Wheelbarrows turn,
        Dig three feet deep into the earth,
        Dredge the river to save the turbulent waters.
        Drive away floods,
        Eliminate salinity,
        Guarantee a good harvest,
        Seize high yields,
        Benefit future generations,
        The motherland will always be spring.
    I Listen to the Party's Words
          Liu Mingke
    I listen to the Party's words,
        The shovel listens to my words.
    Chairman Mao said one sentence,
        Building a thousand-mile dam on flat ground.
    Laborers Cannot Do Without Chairman Mao's Books
        Li Xiyan
    Two pillars and a beam,
        Five purlins to build a house,
        Chairman Mao's portrait hangs in the center,
        A couplet posted on both sides,
        The work shed is full of Chairman Mao's books,
        Chairman Mao's quotations are plastered on the wall.
    The lights in the work shed shine at night,
        The laborers are busy studying "Selected Works of Mao."
    Laborers cannot do without Chairman Mao's books,
        Red laborers have red thoughts.
    Chairman Mao's Quotations Are Given to Me
            Xia Xinghe
    Chairman Mao's quotations are given to me,
        The Party's care warms my heart,
        Pull the cart and look towards Beijing,
        Vow to conquer the Hai River for the revolution.
    Chairman Mao's quotations are given to me,
        Sailing the sea has a rudder,
        Living study and application brightens the heart,
        Draining water, removing alkali, and eliminating disasters.
    Chairman Mao's quotations are given to me,
        Carry it with me, close to my heart,
        Completely and thoroughly for the people,
        Singing new songs on the construction site.
    Chairman Mao's quotations are given to me,
        The fire of revolution is burning in my chest,
        Establish the "Foolish Old Man" ambition to move mountains,
        Dare to cross mountains of knives and seas of fire.
    Five-Good Medal
        Han Guoxiang
    The five-good medal hangs on my chest,
        Stirring up a thousand waves in my heart,
        Chairman Mao drew a happy picture,
        I am giving the Hai River a new look.
    The Party guides the needle and thread,
        Flowers of happiness bloom for ten thousand years,
        The work I do is smaller than a needle tip,
        The honor given by the Party is longer than a thread.
    It's not that I was born with hard bones,
        It's not that I grew up with high aspirations,
        Chairman Mao's works are ten thousand degrees hot!
        Refining my will for revolution and my body like steel!
    The five-good medal shines red,
        Laborers are full of energy,
        Pushing the earth, they love to climb high slopes,
        Revolutionary steps are always upward!
    The Steel Shovel Is My Gun
      Xixindian Correspondence Group
    Taking the position to harness the Hai River,
        The steel shovel is my gun.
    Flying carts and dancing shovels with high morale,
        The big river makes way when it sees me.
    Soldiers use guns to fight,
        I use a steel shovel to dig the riverbed.
    Soldiers use guns to defend the country,
        I give the Hai River a new look.
    Expedition
          Zeyou
    The Party's order sounds,
        The river-harnessing army leaves the village,
        Carts and iron shovels in rows,
        A million-strong army is mighty,
        Red flags fluttering to greet the rising sun,
        The steps are neat and the songs are loud and clear.
    The camp is stretched across five hundred li,
        The starting work chant echoes in the sky,
        Divide the troops and deploy them to fight the old heaven,
        Iron shovels waving, flashing silver light,
        Establish the heroic ambition to control the water,
        Dare to call the Hai River a new look.
    Song of Battle
        Liu Baichuan
    Battle!
        Flags flutter on the banks of Heilonggang.
        The many strong men,
        All show their abilities.
    Battle!
        Silver shovels dance, and earth carts turn.
        Looking back in surprise,
        Push out a mountain.
    Battle!
        Create a new chapter in river control.
        Let "Heilong,"
        Obey orders from now on.
    Steel Shovel in Hand
        He Dou
    Five-foot steel shovel in hand,
        Full of strength and energetic,
        Harnessing the Hai River to be a tough guy,
        Leading Heilong by the nose.
    Digging open the hard soil layer,
        Repairing the drainage ditch,
        Writing a magnificent chapter with both hands,
        The commune is bountiful every year.

    誓为革命治海河
    海河工地诗选
    河北省人民响应毛主席“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召，在今年春季继续投入黑龙港地区的工程建设。治河民工和干部们在施工现场上忘我地劳动，把毛主席的号召当作他们行动的指南，创造了不少奇迹。他们在劳动中还拿起笔杆子，创作了不少文艺作品，歌颂我们伟大的党，歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他们不仅是一支生产革命大军，而且是一支文化革命大军。这是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下出现的崭新的革命气象。　编　者
