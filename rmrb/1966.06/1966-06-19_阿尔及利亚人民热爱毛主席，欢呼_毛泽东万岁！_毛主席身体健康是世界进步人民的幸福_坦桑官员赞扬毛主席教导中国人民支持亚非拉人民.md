    According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers: During recent performances by the China Taiyuan Acrobatic Troupe in eastern Algeria and the capital, Algiers, audiences expressed their love for Chairman Mao Zedong.

    In the eastern city of Souk Ahras, when Chinese artists sang the song praising Chairman Mao, "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the audience shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" In another eastern city, Jijel, a worker said after watching a performance: "Mao Zedong is remarkable. We understand Mao Zedong. The great Mao Zedong sent such a wonderful acrobatic troupe." A journalist in Constantine praised: The performance of the Chinese acrobats fully demonstrates Chairman Mao's unwavering revolutionary spirit.

    Some audience members were concerned about Chairman Mao's health. When a former Mujahid (demobilized soldier) learned that Chairman Mao was in good health, he happily said, "This is not only the happiness of the Chinese people, but also the happiness of all progressive people in the world."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam: Mjolu, Principal Secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry of Rural Development and National Culture, said here recently that under the guidance of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people firmly support the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are still suffering.

    Mjolu was a member of the Tanzanian cultural delegation that recently visited China. He recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about his impressions of his visit to China.

    He said, "Everywhere we went, in factories and people's communes, we saw Chairman Mao's quotations and poems written on the walls. The Chinese people are working very hard to study Chairman Mao's works."

    He warmly praised the high political consciousness and spirit of self-reliance of the Chinese people. He said, "Workers, peasants, and soldiers are united like one person. They have political consciousness." "They are truly consciously working for the development of their motherland."

    He highly praised the policy of Chinese culture and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He said, "I have a very deep impression of the cultural work teams. They go deep into the countryside to serve the peasants."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, June 16: Tanzanian Minister for Economic Affairs and Development Planning Paul Bomani said at a press conference held here on the 16th that the economic cooperation agreement signed between the Tanzanian government economic delegation and the Chinese government during its visit to China "specifically demonstrates the desire of the two governments to further promote and strengthen the existing friendly relations and economic cooperation between the two countries."

    Bomani recently returned here after leading the Tanzanian government economic delegation to visit China.

    He said that the loans and grants provided by China to Tanzania under this agreement are free of any conditions. He also said that the interest-free loans provided by China will help Tanzania immediately implement and complete certain development plans, most of which were originally included in a loan promised by the British government, but because Britain later refused to give this loan to Tanzania, the Tanzanian government was unable to implement these plans.

    He said that the Tanzanian delegation "was extremely moved by the fact that the government of the People's Republic of China sympathetically understood Tanzania's development aspirations and problems. Discussions were conducted in an extremely frank and friendly atmosphere."

    Speaking about his impressions of his visit to China, he said that the Chinese people are consciously working with great determination to build the country.

    He said that the Tanzanian delegation visited Chinese industrial enterprises and agricultural departments and "was deeply impressed by the remarkable progress made by the Chinese people in these and other areas."

    He pointed out: "China's industry is well-organized and efficiently managed." He said, "Wherever the delegation went, it found that the Chinese people had a consistent goal and a sense of responsibility."

    毛主席身体健康是世界进步人民的幸福
    坦桑官员赞扬毛主席教导中国人民支持亚非拉人民
    据新华社阿尔及尔电　中国太原杂技团最近在阿尔及利亚东部和首都阿尔及尔多次演出时，观众们表达了他们对毛泽东主席的爱戴。
    在东部城市苏卡赫拉斯，当中国艺术家演唱歌颂毛主席的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》时，观众们高呼“毛泽东万岁！”在另一东部城市吉杰利，一位工人观看演出后说：“毛泽东了不起。我们了解毛泽东。是伟大的毛泽东派来了这样一个精采的杂技团。”君士坦丁的一个记者赞扬说：中国杂技演员的演出，充分显示了毛主席的坚定不移的革命精神。
    有些观众对毛主席的健康很关心。当一位前圣战者（复员军人）知道毛主席身体很健康时，他高兴地说：“这不但是中国人民的幸福，而且是全世界所有进步人民的幸福。”
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚乡村发展和国民文化部主任秘书姆乔鲁最近在这里说，中国人民在毛主席的教导下，坚决支持仍在受苦受难的亚非拉被压迫人民。
    姆乔鲁是最近访问中国的坦桑尼亚文化代表团的团员。他在最近对新华社记者谈了他访华的印象。
    他说：“在工厂和人民公社，我们所到之处，都看见墙上写着毛主席的语录和诗。中国人民十分努力学习毛主席的著作。”
    他热烈赞扬中国人民高度的政治觉悟和自力更生的精神。他说：“工农兵团结得象一个人一样。他们有政治觉悟。”“他们是真正自觉地在为祖国的发展而工作。”
    他高度赞扬中国文化艺术为工农兵服务的方针。他说：“我对文化工作队有着十分深刻的印象。他们深入农村为农民服务。”
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆十六日电　坦桑尼亚经济事务和发展计划部长保罗·博马尼十六日在这里举行的记者招待会上说，坦桑尼亚政府经济代表团在访问中国期间同中国政府签订的两国经济合作协定，“具体表明了两国政府要进一步促进和加强两国现有的友好关系和经济合作的愿望”。
    博马尼率领坦桑尼亚政府经济代表团访问中国后最近回到这里。
    他说，中国根据这个协定给予坦桑尼亚的贷款和赠款，不附有任何条件。他还说，中国提供的无息贷款，将帮助坦桑尼亚立即实施和完成某些发展计划，其中大部分计划原来包括在英国政府答应提供的一笔贷款内，但是由于英国后来拒绝把这笔贷款交给坦桑尼亚，所以坦桑尼亚政府无法实施这些计划。
    他说，坦桑尼亚代表团“看到了中华人民共和国政府同情地了解坦桑尼亚的发展愿望和问题，极为感动。讨论是在极其坦率和友好的气氛中进行的”。
    他谈到访华的观感时说，中国人民自觉地以巨大的决心进行劳动，以建设国家。
    他说，坦桑尼亚代表团参观了中国的工业企业和农业部门，“对中国人民在这些方面和其它方面取得的显著进展，有深刻印象。”
    他指出：“中国的工业组织得很好，管理得很有效率。”他说，“代表团不论到什么地方，它发现中国人民的目标一致，有责任感。”
