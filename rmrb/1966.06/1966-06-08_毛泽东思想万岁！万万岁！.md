    Long Live Mao Zedong Thought! Long, Long Live!
    Huang Shunyu, Representative of the National People's Congress, Political Captain of the Tenth Production Team, Dongsheng Brigade, Dongsheng Commune, Yanji County, Jilin Province

    When I heard that the bourgeois so-called "authorities" slander our workers, peasants, and soldiers' living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism," I felt resentment and disgust from the bottom of my heart, and I also found it very ridiculous.

    These bourgeois guys think of themselves as "knowledge authorities," but to be honest, you don't understand what knowledge is at all, and you don't have any knowledge. The workers, peasants, and soldiers are the ones who truly have knowledge, definitely not you. The working people are the masters who create human history. Is this elementary school common sense, do you understand it? All true knowledge comes from practice. Is this also elementary school common sense, do you understand it? The workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country are eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, doing great things that change the world and create miracles. This is a fact that even elementary school students see and understand. Do you understand it? You don't understand, you don't understand! This is determined by your class instinct; it is impossible for you to understand. Your practice is playing with antiques, flipping through "garbage," drinking tea, and chatting. Your knowledge is planning how to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, how to slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers, how to poison the youth, and how to engage in capitalist restoration. You "knowledgeable" "authorities" are just a shovelful of garbage in human history, talking antiques in the bourgeois study. The truly vulgar and boring ones are you, definitely not the workers, peasants, and soldiers. You vainly attempt to use the two big sticks of "vulgarization" and "simplification" to sever the flesh-and-blood connection between us workers, peasants, and soldiers and Mao Zedong Thought, and to stop the huge revolutionary tide of the workers, peasants, and soldiers' living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This is daydreaming, an ant trying to shake a tree, wishful thinking! The revolutionary historical tide will sweep you away without a trace. You gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist blackguards, why do you rack your brains and try every possible means to slander our workers, peasants, and soldiers' study of Chairman Mao's works? We are very clear about this. Because you are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, you hate Mao Zedong Thought, you are afraid of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, you hate the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by our workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will raid your old homes, leaving you with nowhere to hide, and making your bourgeoisie extinct. Isn't that so?! Let me tell you, your idea is just like trying to pick stars from the sky, completely impossible.

    Chairman Mao's words are the words in the hearts of our workers, peasants, and soldiers, and completely express the revolutionary demands of our working people. Chairman Mao's works and we have a deep class connection. We love it, we respect it. Everyone, regardless of age or gender, loves to read it. We understand it when we read it, and we use it when we understand it, and it produces infinite power when we use it. You bourgeois "authorities" and "politicians" cannot understand and could never understand the workers, peasants, and soldiers' infinitely respectful feeling towards Mao Zedong Thought. Because you are reactionary bourgeois agents, you wear the same pants as modern revisionism. Like vine, like fruit, like class, like speech. Your so-called "authorities'" anti-Party clamoring is just the death throes of the bourgeoisie heading towards its final demise. We have no common language at all.

    Mao Zedong Thought is a truth that applies to the whole world, and it is effective wherever it is used. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, we listened to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and followed the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution. We defeated the Japanese devils, drove away American imperialism, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and established our own regime. During the land reform period, we listened to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and confronted the landlords, smashing the feudal system to pieces, and our broad masses of peasants became masters. After the national liberation, we listened to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, followed the path of organization, realized agricultural collectivization and people's communes, relied on our own efforts to strive for progress, and continuously consolidated and developed the collective economy, rushing towards socialism and communism. I ask you: Is this "vulgarization," "simplification," or "pragmatism"?

    I am a Korean woman, a mother of five children, forty-two years old this year, originally an illiterate, born into a poor peasant family, who in the past suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation from the feudal landlord class and Japanese imperialism. After liberation, I attended night school. The Party and Chairman Mao removed my illiterate label. In 1949, I read Chairman Mao's book for the first time. Chairman Mao's words are all about the principles of oppressed people standing up and making revolution. The more I read, the more I loved to read, and the brighter my heart became, I was so absorbed in reading it. When I went to work in the fields, I carried Chairman Mao's book with me, took it out to read during breaks, read it while cooking, and took time to read it before going to bed at night, sometimes reading until dawn. Why do I do this? Do you know? You simply cannot understand, because I have a heart that loves the Party and loves Chairman Mao, a heart that loves socialism. To make revolution, you must have weapons, and the only weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. That's how I studied Chairman Mao's four volumes from beginning to end. Some articles I didn't read once, but three times, five times, eight times, ten times... I learned and then I used it, using it for my own ideological transformation, using it in class struggle, using it in production struggle, using it in scientific experiments, and using it in the struggle against imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism. We are in the mountains, but we see the victory of the Chinese socialist revolution, we see the victory of the world revolution, and we see even more clearly the waves created by you demons and monsters. When have you bourgeois bigwigs ever seen an ordinary housewife like me be able to grasp revolutionary theory, be able to stand in the ranks of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution struggle? Is this "vulgarization," "simplification," or "pragmatism"?

    There is a female commune member in our team named Ma Yushun. A few years ago, she was still a kid wearing a red scarf. After graduating from junior high school, she returned to the team to participate in labor. In the labor, she creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, transformed her thinking, armed her mind with Mao Zedong Thought, established lofty revolutionary ideals, was not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue, and led the youth to charge into battle in the three great revolutionary movements. She received the praise and love of the broad masses of commune members, and became a youth model in the whole prefecture. This spring, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Is this "vulgarization," "simplification," or "pragmatism"?

    Our production team was originally a famous poor mountain valley. In the past, some class enemies discouraged us, saying, "Every place has a future, but your place has no future." We don't believe their nonsense. We believe that as long as people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all difficulties can be overcome, and all miracles can be created. Under the leadership of the Party branch, we actively organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Get Rid of the Burden and Start the Machine," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." We also organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," using Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" to analyze contradictions, grasp contradictions, and resolve contradictions, taking class struggle as the key link, and carrying out the movement of farming for the revolution and scientific farming. In just a few years, we have turned a poor mountain valley into a leaping valley. Last year, grain production increased by 32 percent. We have also established orchards. The barren hills of the past have now become shady green forests, presenting a prosperous and flourishing new socialist countryside. This is the result of the broad masses of commune members' living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Is this also "vulgarization," "simplification," or "pragmatism"?

    In the past, rural areas could not run universities. Not only could they not run universities, but many children of poor and lower-middle peasants could not go to school at all. In 1958, our commune, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, established a half-farming, half-study university called Liming Amateur Labor University. At that time, some bourgeois "authorities" slandered us, "You don't have professors, you don't have equipment, how can you run a university?" We replied, "We don't have professors, we don't have equipment, but we have the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, everything can be done well." After the school was established, those bourgeois "authorities" said again, "This is not a university, but an agricultural technical training class." We didn't listen to this at all. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and have persisted for eight years. The school is getting better and better. There have already been three graduating classes from here. Some serve as agricultural technicians, some serve as teachers in agricultural middle schools, and some serve as vice-principals in labor universities. They have played a great role on the agricultural production front. They are the revolutionary successors educated by Mao Zedong Thought. Is this also "vulgarization," "simplification," or "pragmatism"?

    You don't not see these facts, but are afraid of these facts, because you hate Mao Zedong Thought and hate socialism. Because Mao Zedong Thought is the revolutionary truth, is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, and is your mortal enemy. Therefore, you are terrified when you see Mao Zedong Thought, and you try your best to slander and sabotage it. But the opposite is true. It just bumps against the heads of you "authorities," making you break your heads and bleed.

    We will never be discouraged because you scold us and slander our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. On the contrary, we feel proud! Because your scolding proves that what we are doing is completely right, completely correct. That is what Chairman Mao taught us: Whatever the enemy opposes, proves that we are doing it right. We want to tell you frankly: Truth cannot be overthrown by scolding. The more fiercely you scold, the more it proves the great correctness and brilliant splendor of Mao Zedong Thought! The more you scold us, the more we will intensify our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The real authorities are not you, but the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The era of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering culture and theory has already begun. Now is the era when the proletarian revolution is heading towards its final victory and capitalism is heading towards its final demise, not the era when you few bourgeois "authorities" are kings and hegemons. We will definitely persist in unremittingly living studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end. No matter what bourgeois "authorities," no matter what "Three-Family Village" or "Eight-Family Village," we will crush you all to pieces.

    Our great leader Chairman Mao is the lighthouse, the helmsman, the sun. From the bottom of our hearts we shout: Long live our greatest Chairman Mao, long live, long, long live! We will always sing loudly that Mao Zedong Thought is the never-setting sun. Not only will our generation sing, but our children and grandchildren will sing like this forever. Forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever make revolution, thoroughly make revolution, and bury imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the new Soviet leadership, and reactionaries of all countries, and you demons and monsters, all in the grave!

    Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long, long live!

    毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！
    全国人民代表大会代表　吉林省延吉县东盛公社东盛大队第十生产队政治队长  黄顺玉
    当我听到资产阶级的所谓“权威”，诬蔑我们工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的时候，使我从心眼里感到可恨可恶，而且可笑得很。
    这帮资产阶级家伙自认为是什么“知识权威”，老实说，你们根本不懂什么是知识，也根本没有知识。真正有知识的是工农兵群众，绝不是你们。劳动人民是创造人类历史的主人，这是小学生的常识，你们懂吗？一切真知来源于实践，这也是小学生的常识，你们懂吗？全国工农兵群众正在如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作武器，做着改天换地创造人间奇迹的大事情，这是小学生都看到都懂得的事实，你们懂得吗？不懂，你们不懂！这是你们阶级本能所决定的，你们根本不可能懂得。你们的实践是手里玩着古董，翻着“垃圾”，喝茶聊天的实践。你们的知识就是计划如何反党反社会主义，如何诬蔑工农兵群众，如何毒害青年，如何搞资本主义复辟。你们这些“有知识”的“权威”们，只不过是人类历史上的一锹垃圾，是资产阶级书斋里会说话的古董罢了。真正庸俗无聊的是你们，绝不是工农兵群众。你们妄图用“庸俗化”、“简单化”两根大棒子打断我们广大工农兵同毛泽东思想的血肉联系，阻挡广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的巨大革命潮流。这是白日作梦，是蚂蚁撼大树，痴心妄想！革命历史潮流会把你们冲得无影无踪。你们这伙反党反社会主义的黑帮，为什么要苦费心机，千方百计地诬蔑我们工农兵学习毛主席著作呢？这点我们非常清楚。因为你们害怕毛泽东思想，仇视毛泽东思想，你们害怕工农兵群众，仇视工农兵群众。毛泽东思想一旦为我们工农兵群众所掌握，就要抄你们的老家，使你们无藏身之地，叫你们资产阶级绝种。难道不是这样吗？！告诉你们，你们的想法不过是想到天上摘星星，根本办不到。
    毛主席的话，就是我们工农兵群众心里的话，完全表达了我们劳动人民的革命要求。毛主席著作和我们有深厚的阶级因缘，我们热爱它，崇敬它，不管男女老少都爱读，读了就懂，懂了就用，用了就产生无穷的力量。你们这些资产阶级的“权威”、“政客”，对工农兵无限崇敬毛泽东思想的心情，是根本不能理解，也不可能理解的。因为你们是反动的资产阶级代理人，你们和现代修正主义穿一条裤子。什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。你们这伙所谓“权威”的反党叫嚣，不过是资产阶级走向最后灭亡的哀鸣。你们和我们根本没有共同语言。
    毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，用在哪里哪里灵。在抗日战争和解放战争时期，我们听毛主席的话，读毛主席书，跟共产党、毛主席闹革命，打败了日本鬼子，赶跑了美帝国主义，推翻了国民党反动政权，建立了我们自己的政权；在土地改革时期，我们听毛主席的话，读毛主席书，跟地主对阵，把封建制度打得稀烂，我们广大农民翻身作了主人；全国解放以后，我们听毛主席的话，读毛主席书，走组织起来的道路，实现农业合作化、人民公社化，自力更生奋发图强，不断巩固发展集体经济，朝着社会主义、共产主义方向猛跑。我问你们：难道这是“庸俗化”“简单化”“实用主义”吗？
    我是一个朝鲜族妇女，五个孩子的妈妈，今年四十二岁，原来是一个文盲，出身在一个贫农家庭，过去受尽了封建地主阶级和日本帝国主义的压迫和剥削。解放后，我上了夜校，党和毛主席给我摘掉了文盲帽子，一九四九年我第一次读到毛主席的书。毛主席说的话都是我们受压迫人民翻身闹革命的道理，越读越爱读，越读心里越亮堂，读的都发迷了。下地干活我把毛主席的书带在身边，休息时候拿出来看一看，烧火做饭也看，一边烧火一边看书，晚上睡觉以前也抽时间看，有时候竟看到天亮。我为什么这样呢？你们知道吗？你们根本不可能理解，因为我有颗热爱党热爱毛主席的心，一颗热爱社会主义的心。要革命就要有武器，唯一的武器就是毛泽东思想。我就是这样从头到尾学习毛主席的四卷书，有些文章不是看一遍，而是看三遍五遍，八遍十遍……学习了就用，用在自己的思想改造上，用在阶级斗争上，用在生产斗争上，用在科学实验上，用在同帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的斗争上。我们身在山沟，但我们看到中国社会主义革命的胜利，看到世界革命的胜利，更看清楚你们这些牛鬼蛇神的兴风作浪。你们这些资产阶级大老爷们，什么时候你们看见过象我这样一个普通的家庭妇女能够掌握革命理论，能站到中国革命和世界革命斗争的行列呢？难道这是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”吗？
    我们队里有个女社员叫马玉顺，前几年还是一个戴红领巾的毛孩子，初中毕业回队参加劳动，在劳动中活学活用毛主席著作，改造了思想，用毛主席思想武装了头脑，树立了远大的革命理想，不怕苦，不怕累，在三大革命运动中带领青年冲锋陷阵，受到广大社员的称赞和爱戴，成为全州的青年标兵。今年春天光荣地参加了中国共产党。难道这是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”吗？
    我们生产队原来是一个有名的穷山沟，以前有些阶级敌人泄我们的气，他们说：“无论那个地方都有前途，就是你们这个地方没有前途。”我们不信他们这套鬼话，我们相信只要人们用毛泽东思想武装起来，什么困难都可以战胜，什么奇迹都能创造出来。在党支部领导下，我们积极组织大家学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《放下包袱，开动机器》、《将革命进行到底》等文章，还组织社员学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》，用毛主席的《矛盾论》来分析矛盾，抓住矛盾，解决矛盾，以阶级斗争为纲，开展为革命种田，科学种田的运动。仅仅几年就把一个穷山沟改变成一个跃进沟，去年粮食产量增加了百分之三十二，还建立了果树园，过去的荒山秃岭现在变成了绿林成荫，呈现出一片繁荣昌盛的社会主义新农村的景象。这是广大社员活学活用毛主席著作的结果。难道这也是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”吗？
    过去农村不能办大学，不仅不能办大学，很多贫下中农的子女根本上不了学。一九五八年，我们公社在党和毛主席的领导下办了一所半农半读大学，叫黎明业余劳动大学。当时有些资产阶级“权威”诬蔑我们：“你们没有教授，没有设备，凭什么办大学？”我们回答：“我们没有教授，没有设备，可是我们有党和毛主席的领导。有党和毛主席的领导什么事都能办好”。学校办起来以后，那些资产阶级“权威”们又说，“这不是大学，是农业技术训练班”。我们没有听这一套，按毛主席的教导去办，已经坚持了八年，学校办的越来越好。已经有三届毕业生从这里毕业，有的担当农业技术员，有的担任农业中学的教员，有的在劳动大学担任副校长。他们在农业生产战线上发挥了很大作用，他们是毛泽东思想教育出来的革命接班人。难道这也是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”吗？
    你们不是看不见这些事实，而是害怕这些事实，因为你们仇视毛泽东思想，仇视社会主义。因为毛泽东思想是革命的真理，是最高最活的马列主义，是你们的死对头。所以，你们见到毛泽东思想就怕的发抖，极力诬蔑和进行破坏。可是事情恰恰相反，它偏往你们这些“权威”的脑袋上碰，让你们碰得头破血流。
    我们决不因为你们骂我们、诬蔑我们活学活用毛主席著作而气馁，相反我们感到自豪！因为你们的骂，证明我们做的完全对，完全正确。毛主席就是这样教导我们：凡是敌人反对的，证明我们做对了。我们要正告你们：真理是骂不倒的，你们骂的越凶，越证明毛泽东思想的伟大正确，光辉灿烂！你们越骂我们，我们越要加紧活学活用毛主席著作。真正的权威不是你们，是活学活用毛泽东思想的广大工农兵群众。工农兵掌握文化理论的时代已经开始，现在是无产阶级革命走向最后胜利，资本主义走向最后灭亡的时代，不是你们少数资产阶级“权威”称王称霸的时代。我们一定坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。不管什么资产阶级
  “权威”，不管什么“三家村”还是“八家村”，统统把你们踏得粉碎。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席是灯塔，是舵手，是太阳。我们从心里高呼：我们最伟大的毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！我们永远高声歌唱毛泽东思想是不落的太阳，不仅我们这一代唱，我们的子子孙孙永远这样唱。永远听毛主席的话，永远革命，彻底革命，把以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共新领导为中心的现代修正主义以及各国反动派，把你们这些牛鬼蛇神，通通葬入坟墓！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！
