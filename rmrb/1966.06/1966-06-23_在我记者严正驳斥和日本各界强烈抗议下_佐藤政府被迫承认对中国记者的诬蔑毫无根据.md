    Under Our Journalists' Stern Refutation and Strong Protests from All Circles in Japan,
    The Sato Government Was Forced to Admit That the Slander Against Chinese Journalists Was Groundless
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st) The Japanese Sato government recently fabricated rumors and slanders against the legitimate activities of Chinese *People's Daily* and *China Youth Daily* journalists stationed in Japan who were covering Japanese people's protests against the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka. This was met with a stern refutation from Chinese journalists stationed in Japan and widespread opposition from all sectors in Japan. The government was forced to admit that its slander against Chinese journalists was "completely without factual basis" and guaranteed that it "will no longer obstruct the reporting activities of Chinese journalists stationed in Japan in the future."
    On June 20, Koizumi Yoshimi and Tagawa Seiichi, the Japanese parties responsible for the exchange of news correspondents between China and Japan, met with Sun Pinghua, the chief representative of the Tokyo Liaison Office of the Liao Cheng-chih Office, and conveyed the Japanese government's official response to the slander that Chinese journalists stationed in Japan had "participated" in the Japanese people's demonstration against the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka.
    The response stated that "nothing problematic occurred" during the news coverage activities of the *People's Daily* journalist stationed in Japan and the *China Youth Daily* journalist stationed in Japan in Yokosuka. The report made by Minister of State for Autonomy Tadao Nagayama at the Japanese Cabinet meeting on June 3 regarding this issue, as well as the slander against Chinese journalists stationed in Japan published in various Japanese newspapers as a result, "is completely without factual basis." The response stated that the Japanese side "expresses regret" regarding this and guarantees that "it will no longer obstruct the reporting activities of Chinese journalists stationed in Japan in the future."
    As previously reported, the so-called "participation" of Chinese journalists stationed in Japan in the demonstrations held by the Japanese people to protest the entry of American nuclear submarines, and "shouting slogans" along with the marching crowds, fabricated by the Japanese authorities, are completely unfounded malicious slanders. The Japanese government attempted to use this to interfere with, obstruct, and restrict the legitimate reporting activities of Chinese journalists stationed in Japan, and some people attempted to use this to curry favor with the United States and further deteriorate Sino-Japanese relations.
    Chinese *People's Daily* and *China Youth Daily* journalists stationed in Japan held a press conference on June 5 and issued a statement, sternly refuting the rumors fabricated by the Japanese authorities. They demanded that the Japanese parties responsible for the exchange of journalists between China and Japan convey the solemn attitude of the Chinese journalists to the Japanese government and demanded that the Japanese government make an official response to this. All sectors in Japan also strongly protested the Sato government's unreasonable behavior.

    在我记者严正驳斥和日本各界强烈抗议下
    佐藤政府被迫承认对中国记者的诬蔑毫无根据
    新华社东京二十一日电  日本佐藤政府最近就中国《人民日报》和《中国青年报》驻日本记者采访日本人民反对美国核潜艇开进横须贺的新闻的正当活动进行造谣诬蔑，遭到中国驻日记者的严正驳斥和日本各界的广泛反对后，被迫承认它对中国记者的诬蔑“是完全没有事实根据的”，并且保证“以后不再阻挠中国驻日记者的采访活动”。
    六月二十日，负责中日交换新闻记者的日方当事人古井喜实和田川诚一等会见廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所首席代表孙平化，转达了日本政府就诬蔑中国驻日记者“参加”日本人民反对美国核潜艇开进横须贺的示威一事的正式答复。
    答复说，中国《人民日报》驻日记者、《中国青年报》驻日记者在横须贺采访新闻的活动中“是没有发生什么问题的”，自治大臣永山忠则六月三日在日本内阁大臣会议就此问题所作的报告，以及由此而发生的日本各报所刊载的对中国驻日记者的诬蔑，“是完全没有事实根据的”。答复说，日方对此“表示遗憾”，并且保证“以后不再阻挠中国驻日记者的采访活动”。
    前已报道，日本当局捏造的所谓中国驻日记者“参加”了日本人民举行的抗议美国核潜艇开进的示威，并且和游行队伍一起“呼口号”等等，完全是无中生有的恶意中伤。日本政府企图借此干涉、阻挠和限制中国驻日记者的正当的采访活动，某些人企图借此讨好美国，进一步恶化中日关系。
    中国《人民日报》、《中国青年报》驻日记者在六月五日曾就此事件举行了记者招待会并发表声明，严正驳斥日本当局的造谣。他们要求中日交换记者的日方当事人把中国记者的严正态度转达给日本政府，并要求日本政府对此作出正式答复。日本各界也纷纷强烈抗议佐藤政府的这种无理行为。
