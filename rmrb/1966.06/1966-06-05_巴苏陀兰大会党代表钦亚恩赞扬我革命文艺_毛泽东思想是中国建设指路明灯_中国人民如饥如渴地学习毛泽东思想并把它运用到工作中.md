    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd -- Ramagole Chinyane, representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in Cairo, told Xinhua reporters here on the 3rd about his recent visit to China, saying, "Mao Zedong Thought is the true guiding light for the rapid development of socialist construction in the People's Republic of China. All workers, farmers, and other strata of the Chinese people are studying Mao Zedong Thought eagerly and applying it to their work."
    Chinyane said, "The militancy and internationalism of the Chinese people impressed us most deeply. We met many people on the streets, in factories, or in people's communes, and in conversations, we found that they were all determined to fight imperialism and new and old colonialism to the end and expressed their support for the struggles of the oppressed people of the world, such as the struggles of the Vietnamese people and the Congolese (Léopoldville) people. They uncompromisingly and unswervingly support the African people's struggle against imperialism and for liberation."
    Chinyane refuted the imperialist slanders against China, especially the recent slanderous remarks about China's Cultural Revolution. He said, "The imperialist slanders are completely false."
    He talked about the modern Peking operas, the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and other revolutionary songs and dances he saw or heard in China, saying that all these performances expressed the revolutionary feelings of the revolutionary Chinese people. "We found that China's songs, dances, and all other literary and artistic creations are not for the entertainment of the bourgeoisie and other minorities, but to educate the people, especially the younger generation. This way, they will not forget the sacrifices of the older generation of revolutionaries and their revolutionary traditions, and carry their revolution to the end."
    Chinyane continued, "The Chinese people's hard work also left a deep impression on us. Their national construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, and all these achievements have been achieved by the Chinese people themselves through the implementation of the self-reliance policy. The flourishing of the people's communes has also shattered the imperialist slanders against this system with a solid foundation."
    Chinyane praised China's excellent health work. He said, "China is one of the cleanest countries in the world."

    巴苏陀兰大会党代表钦亚恩赞扬我革命文艺
    毛泽东思想是中国建设指路明灯
    中国人民如饥如渴地学习毛泽东思想并把它运用到工作中
    新华社开罗三日电　巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代表拉马格勒·钦亚恩三日在这里向新华社记者谈到他最近访问中国的观感说：“毛泽东思想是中华人民共和国社会主义建设迅速发展的真正指路明灯，所有的工人、农民和其他各阶层中国人民正在如饥如渴地学习毛泽东思想，并在自己的工作中运用毛泽东思想。”
    钦亚恩说：“中国人民的战斗性和国际主义给我们的印象最深。我们在街上、在工厂或人民公社里遇到许多人，在交谈中发现他们都决心要同帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争到底，并且表示支持和声援世界被压迫人民的斗争，例如支持越南人民和刚果（利）人民的斗争。他们毫不妥协和毫不动摇地支持非洲人民反对帝国主义和争取解放的斗争。”
    钦亚恩驳斥帝国主义对中国的污蔑，特别是最近对中国文化革命的谰言。他说：“帝国主义的谰言完全是虚假的。”
    他谈到他在中国看到或听到的现代京剧、芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》和其他革命歌舞时说：所有这些演出都表达了革命的中国人民的革命感情。“我们发现，中国的歌舞和其他一切文艺创作不是为了资产阶级等少数人的娱乐，而是为了教育人民，特别是年青一代。这样他们就不会忘记老一辈革命者的牺牲和他们的革命传统，把他们的革命进行到底。”
    钦亚恩接着说：“中国人民的艰苦奋斗也给我们留下深刻的印象。他们的国家建设突飞猛进，这一切成就都是中国人民自己实行自力更生政策取得的。人民公社的欣欣向荣也粉碎了帝国主义对这个有着巩固基础的制度的污蔑。”
    钦亚恩盛赞中国的出色的卫生工作。他说：“中国是世界上最清洁的国家之一。”
