According to Xinhua News Agency, London, just 80 days after the British Labour Party government won the election and came to power, it now faces various political and economic difficulties, with crises in both domestic and foreign policies converging. As the weekly magazine "Economist" recently said: "The sad things are not just one or two, but coming in droves."

The dispute within the Labour Party over the Wilson government's "East of Suez" policy has flared up again. The "Sunday Times" reported on the 19th: "Almost 100 backbenchers feel they cannot support the government's (East of Suez) policy." According to the newspaper, there is now an "alliance" within the Labour Party that opposes Prime Minister Wilson on the "East of Suez" issue. This "alliance" includes both right-wing and left-wing Labour MPs. This "alliance" is based on a simple argument: Britain cannot bear such a heavy overseas "burden."

At the same time, British public opinion against Wilson's support for the U.S. invasion of Vietnam is growing stronger. The British public has also been holding demonstrations against the U.S. invasion of Vietnam and against the Labour government's support for the U.S. aggression.

In the economic sphere, industrial production remains stagnant, and steel output has dropped significantly. Prices continue to rise. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Callaghan himself, since the Labour Party came to power, the cost of living has increased by 7.5%.

In terms of the balance of payments, there is a huge deficit. In the next four years, it is necessary to repay external debts totaling 900 million pounds. The trade deficit for the first five months of this year has increased compared to the same period last year. In addition, since March, gold and dollar reserves have been continuously declining.

The weakness of the British economy is also reflected in the weakening position of the pound. Since March, the pound has been under continuous pressure. In the first half of June, the pound's exchange rate against the dollar fell to its lowest point since the pound crisis in the autumn of 1964.

    威尔逊政府内外政策危机交集
    “苏伊士以东”政策遭广泛反对，经济停滞，英镑危机更严重
  据新华社伦敦电　英国工党政府在大选中获胜上台以后才八十天，现在又面临着各种政治和经济困难，内外政策的危机交集。正如《经济学家》周刊最近所说的：“伤心事不是一桩两桩，而是纷至沓来”。
    工党内部关于威尔逊政府的“苏伊士以东”政策的争吵又爆发了。《星期日泰晤士报》十九日报道：“几乎有一百个（工党）后座议员感到不能支持政府的（苏伊士以东）政策。”据报纸透露，现在在工党内部有一个在“苏伊士以东”问题上反对威尔逊首相的“联盟”。这个“联盟”包括右翼和“左翼”的工党议员。这个“联盟”建立在这样一个简单的论点上：英国承担不了这么重的海外“义务”。
    同时，英国公众反对威尔逊支持美国侵略越南政策的情绪也越来越强烈。英国公众也一直在举行示威，反对美国侵略越南和反对工党政府支持美国的侵略。
    在经济方面，整个工业生产仍然停滞，钢产量大幅度下降。物价不断上涨，据财政大臣卡拉汉自己说，从工党上台以来，生活费用已经上涨了百分之七点五。
    在国际收支方面，存在巨额赤字。在今后四年，需要偿付数达九亿英镑的外债。对外贸易赤字今年头五个月比去年同期又有增加。此外，从三月份以来，黄金和美元储备连续下降。
    英国经济的弱点还反映在英镑地位疲软上。从三月份以来，英镑不断受到压力，在六月份的上半月，英镑同美元的比值下跌到了一九六四年秋发生英镑危机以来的最低点。
