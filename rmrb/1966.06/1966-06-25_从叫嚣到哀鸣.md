    Like all reactionaries in history, U.S. imperialism always believes in the role of weapons, but fails to see the role of people; it always overestimates its own strength and underestimates the strength of the revolutionary people. At the beginning of launching the war of aggression against Korea, the United States believed that with its strong military power, it could quickly win the war. At that time, American military and political leaders kept making arrogant noises.
    Before the U.S. launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, the warmonger Dulles personally inspected South Korea and the 38th parallel, openly clamoring: "The time for showing great power is not far away," and "The communists will eventually lose control of North Korea." The American running dog Syngman Rhee also echoed, claiming that "the Northern Expedition will be completed in three days." Just over three months into the war, MacArthur, then the commander of the U.S. forces invading Korea, arrogantly declared on October 15 that "formal resistance throughout North and South Korea will end before Thanksgiving (i.e., the last Thursday of November)." When the U.S. invading forces advanced to the Yalu River, American war-mongers made even more absurd ravings, clamoring that "in history, the Yalu River is not an insurmountable obstacle that clearly divides the two countries (China and Korea)."
    However, the U.S. aggressors completely miscalculated. As a result of the contest on the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors were battered and bloodied by the armies of the people of Korea and China and had to be forced to accept armistice negotiations.
    Clark, who served as the "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces" invading Korea, lamented in his later book, *From the Danube to the Yalu*: "I carried out the government's instructions and gained an unenviable reputation: the first American commander to sign an armistice without achieving victory."
    Bradley, former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, lamented that the U.S. war of aggression against Korea was "the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and against the wrong enemy." Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall had to admit: "The myth has been shattered. The United States is not as strong a power as people imagined."
    From arrogant clamoring to defeated lamentation, this is a great exposure of the U.S. paper tiger, and also a vivid proof of the bankruptcy of the "theory of weapons are everything." However, U.S. imperialism will not learn its lesson from this, and it still believes in its own military power and promotes its policy of aggression everywhere. Therefore, this is doomed to its inevitable continuous failures, continuous lamentations, until it finally enters the grave.

### 从叫嚣到哀鸣

    从叫嚣到哀鸣
    美帝国主义和历史上的一切反动派一样，总是迷信武器的作用，而看不到人的作用；总是过高地估计自己的力量，而过低地估计革命人民的力量。美国在发动侵朝战争之初，就认为凭着自己强大的军事力量，可以很快地取得战争的胜利。当时，美国军政头目不断发出狂妄的叫嚣。
    一九五○年六月美国发动侵朝战争前夕，战争贩子杜勒斯亲自到南朝鲜和三八线进行视察，公开叫嚷：“显示巨大力量的时候已经不远了”，“共产党终将失去对北朝鲜的控制”。美国走狗李承晚也跟着叫嚣什么“三天完成北伐”。战争刚刚打了三个多月，当时的侵朝美军头子麦克阿瑟在十月十五日竟狂妄地宣称“在感恩节（即十一月最后的一个星期四）前，南北朝鲜各地的正式抵抗都将告终”，当美国侵略军进犯到鸭绿江边时，美国战争贩子更发出了荒谬的狂言，他们叫嚷什么“在历史上，鸭绿江并不是把（中朝）两国截然划分的不可逾越的障碍”。
    然而，美国侵略者完全失算了。在朝鲜战场上较量的结果，美国侵略者被朝中两国人民军队打得头破血流，不得不被迫接受停战谈判。
    担任过侵朝“联合国军总司令”的克拉克在他后来所写的《从多瑙河到鸭绿江》一书中发出了这样的哀鸣：“我执行政府的指示，获得了一个不值得羡慕的名望：第一个在没有取得胜利的停战书上签字的美国司令官。”
    美国前参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷哀叹，美国侵朝战争是在“一个错误的地方、错误的时间和错误的敌人进行了一个错误的战争”。美国前国防部长马歇尔不得不承认：“神话已经破灭了。美国原来并不是象人家所想象的那样一个强国”。
    从狂妄的叫嚣到失败的哀鸣，这是美国纸老虎的一次大暴露，也是“唯武器论”破产的一个生动的证明。但是，美帝国主义并不会从中吸取教训，它仍然迷信于自己的军事力量而到处推行侵略政策。因此，这就注定了它必然要不断失败，不断哀鸣，直到最后进入坟墓为止。
