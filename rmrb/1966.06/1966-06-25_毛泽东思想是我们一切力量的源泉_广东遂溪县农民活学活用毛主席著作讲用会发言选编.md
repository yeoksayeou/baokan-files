    Mao Zedong Thought is the Source of All Our Strength
    —Selected Speeches from the Lecture and Application Meeting on the Creative Study and Application of Chairman Mao’s Writings by Peasants in Suixi County, Guangdong
    Editor's Note from *Southern Daily*: On the basis of training rural grassroots cadres in batches and using Mao Zedong Thought to arm them, Suixi County has launched a mass movement to study Chairman Mao’s writings throughout the county. This movement has developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results. Recently, all people's communes, production brigades, and production teams in the county held a lecture and application meeting on the creative study and application of Chairman Mao’s writings. More than 270,000 grassroots cadres and members participated in the meeting, and more than 26,000 people spoke on the stage. Now, we have compiled and published some of the speeches from the meeting.
    In just a few months, Suixi County has launched such a large-scale and vigorous study movement throughout the county. This is a new thing with great vitality that has emerged in our province. This fact once again vividly proves that the new era of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly mastering and applying Marxism-Leninism has begun. The movement of workers and peasants to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao’s writings is like a surging wave as soon as it is launched. We will soon see tens of millions of peasant masses in the province, like a gathering storm, throwing themselves into this great revolutionary torrent. This makes us even more clearly see that certain bourgeois "authorities" who have viciously slandered the creative study and application of Chairman Mao’s writings by workers, peasants, and soldiers as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism" are completely counter-revolutionary fallacies.
    Suixi’s experience also proves that the vast number of rural grassroots cadres and peasant masses are fully capable of gradually transforming themselves into revolutionary teams armed with Mao Zedong Thought, possessing communist consciousness, and proletarianized, just like the People's Liberation Army. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, the peasant masses immediately regarded Chairman Mao's words as the highest instructions, taking the images of Zhang Side, Bethune, and the Old Fool as examples, and consciously transforming their world outlook. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." Because the vast number of cadres and masses consciously transform their world outlook, consciously want to be people who are "utterly selfless and dedicated to serving others," and consciously want to change the world with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man, many so-called "long-standing and difficult" problems are readily solved. Cadres who previously had thoughts of retreat have consciously adhered to the revolution. Cadres who were previously irresponsible in their work have consciously wanted to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Many problems that previously existed in the relationship between public and private have been smoothly resolved in accordance with socialist principles. In the struggle for production, things that could not be done for a long time in the past are now done quickly.
    From this, it can be seen that when the vast number of peasants master Mao Zedong Thought, they will generate infinite material strength. This is the most fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in revolution and construction in the countryside, and it is also the most important guarantee for preventing revisionism and preventing capitalist restoration in the countryside. The more viciously imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, as well as a small handful of domestic demons and monsters, slander, attack, curse, and oppose the creative study and application of Chairman Mao’s writings by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the more firmly all our rural work comrades must launch a mass upsurge in the creative study and application of Chairman Mao’s writings in the rural areas of the province, and guide the peasants of the province to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead bravely!
    Study Chairman Mao’s Writings, Establish the Idea of Serving the People and Farming for the Revolution
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said: "All our working cadres, no matter how high or low their positions, are servants of the people, and everything we do is to serve the people."
    In our country, under the leadership of our Party, all work is revolutionary work and serves the people. Farming is also serving the people and is also revolutionary work. Farming for the revolution is a different world outlook from farming for personal gain. To establish the idea of farming for the revolution, we must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and raise revolutionary consciousness. The vast number of peasant masses in Suixi County are gradually establishing this idea in the process of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s writings, and they are using revolutionary spirit to farm.
    Thoroughly Criticize the Thought of Fearing "Loss"
    Huang Lijin (Captain of the Third Production Team, Potouzai South Village, Jialiao Brigade, Chengyue Commune): When I was a child, my mother remarried to Xijitou Village, Potouzai Brigade, Kelu, Haikang County, and I followed her there. After liberation, I became the captain of the Potouzai Brigade. Last spring, I felt that being a cadre was a "loss" and not as "free" as a member, so I resigned from the position of brigade captain and returned to my old home in the Third Production Team, Potouzai South Village, Jialiao Brigade, Chengyue Commune, Suixi County. Who knew that the members of the Third Production Team would want to elect me as captain again? I resolutely refused. This spring, I studied Chairman Mao’s *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, and other quotations, and also studied the exemplary deeds of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Zuo Feng. The ideological struggle became more and more intense, and I didn't feel like eating or sleeping. Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," taught us to be "utterly selfless and dedicated to serving others." Zhang Side followed Chairman Mao for more than ten years and still went to burn charcoal for the revolution. Bethune traveled across the ocean to help our people's revolution. Wang Jie sacrificed his life to protect the safety of the militia. Jiao Yulu was still thinking about the 360,000 people of Lankao when he was dying. Zuo Feng was able to lead the production team to change its backward production situation even though he had six children. But what about myself? I am selfish and only care about myself. I recalled that my father died when I was three years old, leaving a debt that my mother could not repay, so she had to remarry to repay the debt. After liberation, I not only turned over, but my life became better day by day. The Party also cultivated me into a cadre. Without the Communist Party, without the revolution, where would I be today! But now I have forgotten my roots and don't want the revolution! Thinking of this, I couldn't help but shed tears. I am determined to overcome my selfish and self-serving thoughts and not care about the collective. I publicly reviewed my mistakes at the members' meeting. At the same time, I was determined to lead the members to change the backward situation of the production team. At that time, it was not yet spring plowing. Seeing that there was no fertilizer in the team, I took the lead in accumulating fertilizer and digging manure pools. At first, the members did not listen to me, so I accumulated and dug alone. Soon, the members were moved and all accumulated and dug with me.
    Can a Middle School Graduate Not Raise Cattle?
    Xu Fasheng (Member of the Ninth Team, Jialiao Brigade, Chengyue Commune): When I was a child, I learned how to raise cattle. After graduating from middle school, the production team leader knew that I had raised cattle and asked me to raise them again. I happily accepted this task. Some members said: "It's too unpromising to come back to raise cattle after graduating from middle school." My relatives also advised me to find a promising job to do since I "knew how to read and write." Is raising cattle an unpromising job? I studied Chairman Mao’s *Serve the People* with this question. I thought that Comrade Zhang Side was an old soldier, and the Party asked him to burn charcoal, so he went to burn charcoal, completely obeying the needs of the revolution. I am a child of poor peasants, how can I pick and choose my work? After studying, I further realized that any work that is beneficial to the people is noble work and is revolutionary work. After that, whenever someone said to me that raising cattle was unpromising, I would say to him: "In our socialist country, there are only unpromising people, not unpromising jobs." I want to raise cattle well for the revolution. After my understanding improved, I became even more energetic in raising cattle. I cleaned the cattle dung, padded the cattle pens, and sorted the fodder every day, going out early and returning late all year round. This January, a large cow fell ill. Many members advocated killing it for meat, but I felt that losing a cow would be detrimental to production and firmly opposed it. I tried every means to ask the veterinarian and find herbs to cure the cow. In the past three years, the more than twenty cattle entrusted to me by the team have been well managed, and none have died. The members said that I was not afraid of hardship or fatigue and was willing to work for the production team, and proposed to give me two more work points. I said: "It is the duty of every revolutionary youth to contribute more effort to the revolution." As a result, I still recorded ten work points per day as before.
    Determined to Farm for the Revolution for the Rest of My Life
    Li Rui (Secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch of Tiande Brigade, Caotan Commune): Before studying Chairman Mao’s writings, I had a lot of personal distractions in my mind and was unwilling to farm in the countryside. Last year, when I was about to graduate from Yanggan Middle School, I buried myself in reviewing English and mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and was determined to pass the entrance examination for Tsinghua University. Later, I failed the university entrance examination and felt very discouraged. After returning home, although I was in the countryside, I still yearned for university and planned to review at home for another year and then take the exam again. At that time, I thought that after graduating from university and finding a job, it would be much better than working in the countryside. Because I was not at ease in the countryside and looked down on agricultural labor, I could not establish a relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Later, with the help of the Party branch, I studied Chairman Mao’s *The Orientation of the Youth Movement*, and initially realized that whether or not to combine with the peasants is the dividing line between revolution and non-revolution. So I began to work with the members. Seeing that I could put down my airs and work with them, the members also began to confide in me. In the process of contacting the peasants, I further understood Chairman Mao's teaching on the integration of young intellectuals with the workers and peasants, and established the idea of farming for the revolution. Now, I have given up the idea of taking the university entrance examination and am determined to farm for the revolution in the countryside for the rest of my life, and dedicate all my strength to the collective. Wherever I see difficulties or heavy work, I go there and strive to take on heavy burdens.
    Why I Work More Actively Than Before
    Deng Yingrui (Leader of the Poor Peasants Group of the First Production Team, Xiaqishan, Zhuyetang Brigade, Chengyue Commune): I used to work very actively and was once rated as a second-class labor model in the county, receiving twenty-two awards. In 1963, after my two sons died of illness, I was very sad. I thought: Now that there is no one to take over, it is useless to work any more. From then on, I was gloomy and unhappy. I went to work when I was happy, and went to the market when I was unhappy. I was not as active as before.
    At the end of last year, I started going to the cultural room to read Chairman Mao’s books. In the article *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, Chairman Mao taught us to learn from Bethune’s spirit of utter selflessness and be a noble person who is beneficial to the people. I thought: I used to work actively just to raise my sons. After my sons died, I was unwilling to work more. This is calculating for myself. I should learn from Bethune, always think of the revolution, think of the people of the world, farm for the revolution, farm for the people, and not just farm for my children and grandchildren. After that, I worked more actively than before. Before the spring plowing, seeing that the team lacked fertilizer, I used the morning or evening to go out to accumulate fertilizer, and in less than two months, I accumulated more than 13,000 catties of cow dung for the production team. The members said: "Uncle Yingrui is so active in accumulating fertilizer for the production team, how can we sit still?" Secretly competing with me. On January 20, the weather was very cold and foggy. Member Deng Yingbiao carried a manure basket out before dawn, but I had already picked up a load of cow dung when he left.
    When I Think of Heroes, I Am Not Afraid of Muddy Fields
    Lin Shaoqing (Member of the Communist Youth League of the Third Team, Anji, Tiande Brigade, Caotan Commune): I married into Anji Village in 1962. The first time I went to the field, I was immersed in the muddy field that was waist-deep, and leeches were swimming all over the field, which scared me so much that I almost cried. I ran back to my mother's house, and when I saw my relatives, I cried and said: I married into the wrong place! After that, whenever it was the busy season, I would go back to my mother's house to avoid labor. In the past two years, I only did more than 300 work points a year.
    Last winter, I participated in the county's training class to study Chairman Mao’s writings. I studied *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, and the spirit of Comrade Wang Jie, "Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death." I thought of my previous "fear of everything" and felt ashamed. I was determined to transform the muddy fields with the members.
    Once you understand one principle, you understand everything. After returning to the team, I was full of energy. When I saw leeches, I thought of Comrade Wang Jie and was not afraid. When I was tired from carrying sand and covered in mud, I thought of Comrades Zhang Side and Bethune, and said to myself, what is there to fear of hardship and fatigue when farming for the revolution? With enough courage and strong confidence, I am not afraid of any difficulties. In the past few months, I have been working hard from morning till night with the members to carry sand and transform the muddy fields. Now, the muddy fields in our team are almost all transformed. During this period, the work points I earned in one month were more than in the past year!
    Wholeheartedly for the Public, Wholeheartedly for the Collective
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao taught us to learn from Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter selflessness. We should never put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the people. After studying these teachings of Chairman Mao, the vast number of peasant masses in Suixi County took them as their daily code of conduct, criticized their bourgeois individualism, and worked wholeheartedly for the public and wholeheartedly for the collective.
    Dare to Step Forward in Times of Difficulty
    Chen Nanfeng (Member of the First Production Team, Chenwu Brigade, Yangqing Commune): At the end of last year, the collective production of our team was not very good, and the progress of winter planting, preparing for spring plowing, accumulating fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects was very slow. I was very anxious when I saw this situation. I thought, if this continues, the collective economy will suffer serious losses. What should I do? At this time, I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching that we should step forward in times of difficulty. I mustered up the courage and took the initiative to act as the team leader. At that time, I was a girl who had just turned sixteen, lacking production experience and work experience, and could not arrange work schedules, often arranging them incorrectly. The masses had a lot of opinions, and my parents scolded me, saying that I was "doing lowly work when I could be a noble," and "meddling in too much business." At this time, an ideological struggle also unfolded in my mind: Should I continue? I was afraid that I would not do well and the members would have opinions. Should I not do it? This would be fearing difficulties and not daring to move forward in the face of difficulties. Thinking about it, I remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings. Chairman Mao taught us that when we encounter difficulties, we should see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage. Chairman Mao’s words strengthened my confidence. I enlightened my parents and improved their awareness by using the method of recalling and comparing, so that they not only did not object to me, but also became my staff in production. I didn't understand production technology, so I went to learn. I didn't know how to use cattle, so I asked people for advice. Now, I have learned the basic farm work. The reason I am able to do this is the result of listening to Chairman Mao’s words.
    I Also Want to Do Some Good Things for Everyone
    Liang Qiqin (Poor Peasant of the Xincun Production Team, Huogang Brigade, Caotan Commune): I am sixty-two years old this year. In recent months, all the young people in the team have been reading Chairman Mao’s books, and I often go to listen. Chairman Mao’s words are all in line with my heart, and the more I listen, the more I love to listen, and the more I listen, the more I absorb them. Chairman Mao taught everyone to be "utterly selfless and dedicated to serving others," and taught everyone to "serve the people." When I heard this, I thought to myself that I am a "Five Guarantees" household, and everything I eat, wear, burn, and use is taken care of by everyone. It turns out that this is a good idea from Chairman Mao! I also have to do some good things for everyone. I am determined that as long as I have a breath, I must listen to Chairman Mao’s words and "serve" everyone. Last December, the team's cattle were missing. I went to find the cattle before dawn. I ran around for most of the day, but couldn't find them. I didn't even bother to eat, and called all the young people to look for them everywhere. I went all over the brigade and to the neighboring brigades. After running for two days, I still couldn't find them. Some people were discouraged. I thought, the team is short of cattle power, and what will we rely on for spring plowing if the cattle are not found? I was determined that even if I went to the "end of the world," I would have to find the cattle. On the third day, I ran to Luowu Brigade, and the cattle were found in the sugarcane field! I was overjoyed and led the cattle home. Oh, the cattle were starving! I didn't have time to cook, so I first took some sweet potatoes from home and cooked sweet potato water for the cattle to eat. Everyone praised me for caring about collective property, saying: If it weren't for Uncle Qiqin's determination, these cattle would be finished! I thought, what's there to praise, I'm just listening to Chairman Mao's words!
    Be a Person Who is Beneficial to the People
    Qi Daru (Member of the North First Production Team, Donggang Brigade, Caotan Commune): In the past, my "spontaneous" thinking was relatively serious, and I was always half-hearted about collective production, picking and choosing labor. Last winter, the production team leader took Chairman Mao’s book and came to my house to help me study. The more I listened to Chairman Mao’s words, the more cordial they were. After studying, I realized that I was too backward in the past. In the future, I must make a painful determination to dig out the roots of "selfishness" and be "a person who is beneficial to the people." At the beginning of this year, our team vigorously engaged in accumulating fertilizer, and I actively participated. The production team did not have a boat to transport mud, so I went to Gangtou Village, Yanggan Commune to borrow one. They transported it during high tide, and I borrowed it to transport it during low tide. They transported it during the day, and I borrowed it to transport it at night. Once, it was blowing a northerly wind and raining, and the weather was very cold. I thought this was a good time to accumulate fertilizer, so I borrowed a boat and braved the wind and rain to go to sea to transport sea mud. Who knew that the wind was too strong and the boat ran aground, and I couldn't push it. I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching about not being afraid of difficulties, jumped into the sea, and used my shoulder to push the boat into the deep. I worked hard from morning till night, in the wind and rain, and spent more than twenty days accumulating 1,500 loads of high-quality sea fertilizer for the collective.
    Protect Collective Property Better Than Your Own
    Cai Zhaoren (Captain of the Tenth Production Team, Houxi Brigade, Chengyue Commune): I have not read many of Chairman Mao's books, only *Serve the People* and *In Memory of Norman Bethune*. In these two articles, Chairman Mao taught us to be "utterly selfless and dedicated to serving others," and to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." I followed Chairman Mao’s teachings, always caring about the members, caring about the collective, caring about the revolution, and striving to do a good job in production.
    On the morning of March 9 this year, I was accumulating fertilizer with more than ten members in front of the village, when suddenly I heard shouts of fire in the village. I dropped my hoe and basket and hurriedly ran to the village. I saw thick smoke coming from the house of a member near the production team headquarters, and the flames had already exposed the roof. In order to rescue the property of my class brothers, I rushed into the house to grab and move grain and clothing, regardless of everything. When I rescued a batch of supplies, I heard someone shouting that sparks were flying into the team headquarters. I climbed onto the roof of the team headquarters, took off my clothes, and used my clothes to put out the sparks. At that time, it was a northerly wind, and the fire was very fierce. I couldn't completely put out the sparks with my clothes. I immediately ran home, took the cotton quilt, soaked it in water, and covered the roof of the team headquarters, preventing the fire from spreading to the team headquarters from the neighboring house. After the incident, my wife blamed me. I said to her: "The team headquarters is the house of all the members. There are 2,000 catties of late rice seeds, 800 catties of chemical fertilizer, and the team's farm tools in the house. If it is burned down, there will be a shortage of farm tools and chemical fertilizer for spring plowing, and there will be no planting for the late rice. The lives of more than seventy people in the team will be difficult for a year. Now that the team headquarters has been saved, our loss is nothing."
    Fearless in the Face of Danger
    Wang Tubao (Member of the Changhong Fishing Brigade, Caotan Commune): Last October, when our fishing boat was producing at the Hengshatou fishing ground in the high seas, the nylon trawl net was stuck on a rotten boat at the bottom of the sea, twenty or thirty meters deep. If it was not rescued in time, this newly bought nylon net worth 600 yuan and about 40 dan of fish would be lost. What should I do? The head worker said that the only way was to dive into the sea, find the end of the net drawing rope, and drag the net open. But the water was deep and the current was fast, and it was very dangerous to go to the bottom of the sea. At that time, only one of the nine people on the boat had diving skills, but he was nearly sixty years old and lacked strength to go down. In the face of this difficulty, I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching on serving the people and bravely took on the task of diving. I knew that my diving skills were not good, and there was a danger of drowning or being eaten by sharks at the bottom of the sea, but I thought that I could not let the collective property be lost in vain for personal safety. For the sake of collective interests, even if I unfortunately sacrificed myself, I would die for the interests of the people, and my death would be worthwhile. So I dispelled all my worries and dived to the bottom of the sea along the rope. The water was very deep, and I dived three times in a row, but I couldn't find the end of the net, and seawater forced blood out of my nostrils. But I still persisted, and finally found the end of the net drawing rope on the fourth time and released the fishing net.
    Care for Others, Help Others, Do Good Deeds
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said: "All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, cherish each other, and help each other." The vast number of peasant masses in Suixi County, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, care for others and help others everywhere, and many good people and good deeds have emerged.
    We Cannot Ignore the Difficulties of Other Teams
    Zhao Rutong (Captain of the Second Production Team, Yanwo, Songshu Brigade, Yanggan Commune): In the past, I only hoped to do a good job in my own production team, and I didn't care about other production teams. After studying Chairman Mao’s *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, my eyes saw a little wider. Some time ago, I saw that some teams were more difficult, so I proposed to the team committee and the masses of members to lend ten carts and a sum of money to the difficult teams. At that time, some people did not understand and said: "I don't know when it will be recovered after borrowing it. Won't this be a loss?" In response to this idea, I said to everyone: Comrade Bethune is a foreigner, but he is selfless and wholeheartedly supports the Chinese revolution. We and the members of other difficult teams are class brothers. Our team is relatively rich, and their team is relatively poor. If production is difficult, can we just ignore it? After discussion, everyone understood and unanimously agreed to support them.
    Care for Each Other, Help Each Other
    Tan Renze (Captain of the First Team, Kangtang, Hejiazhi Brigade, Chengyue Commune): Before the Spring Festival, our brigade held a meeting to study the issue of winning a bumper harvest in production this year. At that time, several teams were relatively poor and lacked funds. In particular, the Mo family and Laocun production teams had recently lost cattle and urgently needed funds to purchase them, but they had no cash and hoped that the state would provide loans. I remembered Chairman Mao’s teaching: "All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, cherish each other, and help each other." I thought: After studying Chairman Mao’s writings, we must act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. Our production team has sufficient funds, sufficient carts and strong cattle, and has the responsibility to help poor teams turn over and reduce the burden on the state. So, I discussed with the production team cadres and members, took out some money to support the poor teams, so that they did not have to borrow money from the state. I said to everyone: "Our Kangtang First Team is rich, not because our ancestors were buried in 'dragon land,' nor because the members' 'destiny water' has become good, but entirely because the Communist Party led the revolution and took the road of collectivization. Chairman Mao taught us that all people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other and help each other. Now that the brother teams are in difficulty, we should help them." Old poor peasant Tan Xingfu said: "Before liberation, we were all very poor. In the early days of liberation, we often ate unified sales grain and relief grain. Today, we are rich and cannot forget the state or our class brothers. If other teams are in difficulty, we should support them." After discussion, everyone agreed to take out more than 800 yuan to lend to brother teams to buy cattle and seedlings.
    Treat the "Five Guarantees" Households as Relatives
    Fang Qing (Poor Peasant Youth of the Chengyue Brigade, Chengyue Commune): This year, I participated in the Communist Night School study. After listening to the tutor explain Chairman Mao's *Serve the People*, *In Memory of Norman Bethune* and other articles, I understood that I should not plan for myself first in doing anything, but should plan for others first. I should be selfless and dedicated to serving others. One night in February, the weather suddenly turned cold. I was lying in bed, too cold to sleep. I suddenly remembered the more than ten "Five Guarantees" households in our brigade, and wondered if they were warm enough. I immediately put on my clothes and visited them one by one, visiting eleven households in a row. When I visited Uncle Deng Masheng's house, I found him sitting on a dung bucket, not answering after several calls. It turned out that he had a sudden illness. I immediately helped him to bed. Seeing that his bed and quilt were covered with feces and urine, wet and smelly, I hesitated a bit. But remembering Chairman Mao's teaching that "all people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other," I went straight to the pharmacy, bought some over-the-counter medicine, and brought my own cotton quilt to replace Uncle Masheng's quilt and wash it. After that, I bought medicine for him, boiled medicine, poured stool and urine for him every day, and raised more than 100 yuan for him to send him to Zhanjiang for treatment. After he recovered, he was very grateful to me. I said: "This is what Chairman Mao taught."
    Always Think of Patients
    Huang Peifen (Health Worker of the Changhong Fishing Brigade, Caotan Commune): In the past, I looked down on the work of rural health workers, thinking that it was hard work and unpromising. Therefore, I was careless and irresponsible in my work. The masses said that I was "neither fish nor fowl": neither like a fisherman, nor like a logistics person, nor like a health worker. They also said that I "didn't treat in four situations": no treatment in bad weather, no treatment for emergency illnesses at night, no treatment for long and difficult roads, and no treatment if I didn't like it. After studying Chairman Mao’s *In Memory of Norman Bethune*, I realized that it was wrong to think of myself first in everything. I should learn from Comrade Bethune’s spirit of "utter selflessness and dedication to serving others." From then on, I followed Chairman Mao’s teachings, cared for the masses, and always thought of patients. The young son of member Huang Guogao had bone sores for three years. I couldn't treat him, so I took the initiative to borrow 60 yuan from the brigade and sent him to Zhanjiang Hospital for treatment. In order to save them travel expenses and help them solve the problem of being unfamiliar in Zhanjiang, I rode my bicycle to take his mother and son there. I felt that to learn from Comrade Bethune, I had to be as selfless and dedicated to serving others as he was.
    Risking Danger to Rescue Class Brothers
    Li Shibao (Member of the Changhong Fishing Brigade, Caotan Commune): Last March, our fishing brigade went out to sea to fish. One night, we encountered a level seven or eight gale, making it impossible to produce. I and other members were lying in the cabin sleeping when suddenly I heard something fall into the sea. I ran to the deck and saw that Yang Yayang had fallen into the sea. At this time, the wind and waves were very big and it was very dark. Diving into the sea to save people, not to mention that eight or nine out of ten could not be saved, even one's own life would be lost. According to the past, no one dared to rescue in this situation. But when I thought of Chairman Mao’s teaching that we should learn from Comrade Bethune’s utter selflessness and dedication to serving others, I didn't care about any danger. I immediately went with Ma Zaijie in a small boat to rescue him. I thought at the time that it would not be a big deal if I sacrificed myself, but I could not just watch my class brothers fall into the sea and drown without saving them. I would rather sacrifice myself to rescue my class brothers. After a hard struggle with the wind and waves, we finally rescued Yang Yayang. As soon as we got on the boat, the small boat we were in was also sunk by the wind and waves. Afterwards, some people said that if we had had even a little bit of personal consideration at that time, Yang Yayang would not have been saved. Yes, to wholeheartedly serve the people, there must not be any selfishness.
    Hard Struggle, Overcoming Difficulties
    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao taught us to learn from the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, eliminate all difficulties, and strive for victory." The vast number of peasant masses in Suixi County regard this teaching of Chairman Mao as the sharpest weapon to overcome difficulties. They learn from the "Foolish Old Man," become the "Foolish Old Man," rely on their own efforts, struggle hard, and are determined to change the face of poverty and let chicken feathers fly into the sky.
    Resolutely Do Not Reach Out to the State
    Ruan Yingqin (Secretary of the Party Branch of the Sijiu Brigade, Fucheng Commune): Our team used to have a dependence mentality. Whether it was repairing water conservancy or engaging in production, we had to reach out to the state for money and grain. Almost every spring, we had to get a state loan of several thousand yuan and several thousand catties of supply grain. Chairman Mao taught us to be diligent and thrifty, and to rely on our own efforts. After studying Chairman Mao’s writings, I felt that we should listen to Chairman Mao’s words and act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. At the beginning of this year, I proposed that our team should rely on its own efforts and no longer ask the state for loans and supply grain for repairing water conservancy this year. But in this way, our professional water conservancy team would have to eat some sweet potato rice. Some cadres said: "How can this work? Let's still ask the state for some unified sales grain!" I thought that our peasants are already sorry for not selling grain to the state, and now we have to reach out to the state and drag the state's construction back, is this appropriate? I firmly said to everyone: "Repairing water conservancy, we are not afraid of lacking rice, but we are most afraid of lacking Mao Zedong Thought." So, we resolutely did not want a grain of grain from the state, and organized the laborers to study *Serve the People* and other three articles and Chairman Mao's quotations on hard struggle. Everyone unanimously said that they would eat sweet potato rice and work to the end. All the laborers were in high spirits, and the progress of the project was more than twice as fast as last spring.
    Learn from the "Foolish Old Man," Be the "Foolish Old Man"
    Xie Naiming (Production Team Leader of Keshan, Chengdong Brigade, Fucheng Commune): I used to be an active and hardworking production team leader, and I also made some achievements in my work, but since last year, my work enthusiasm has been poor. I was neither willing to go to meetings nor willing to ask more about the affairs of the production team. The main reason I was like this was that I felt that being a production team leader was troublesome and there were many things to do. I also felt that I was old and it was time to hand over the job.
    After studying Chairman Mao’s article *The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains*, I was greatly shocked ideologically. The Foolish Old Man was ninety years old and still had the courage to remove two mountains. Compared to the Foolish Old Man, I am much younger, so why don't I want the revolution? I recalled the tragic history of my son being killed by the enemy and my daughter-in-law remarrying, which led to the destruction of my family, and I deeply felt that it was too wrong for me to give up the revolution halfway. From then on, I made up my mind to resolutely carry the revolution to the end and completely change the face of the production team.
    Our team has a large population and little land, and we lack grain all year round. Every year, the state supplies 12,000 catties of rice. After studying Chairman Mao’s writings

### 毛泽东思想是我们一切力量的源泉——广东遂溪县农民活学活用毛主席著作讲用会发言选编

专栏：

    毛泽东思想是我们一切力量的源泉
    ——广东遂溪县农民活学活用毛主席著作讲用会发言选编
    《南方日报》编者按：遂溪县在分期分批集训农村基层干部，用毛泽东思想武装基层干部的基础上，在全县开展了群众性的学习毛主席著作运动。这个运动，发展迅猛，收效显著。最近，这个县的各个人民公社、生产大队、生产队普遍召开了一次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，参加讲用会的基层干部和社员共达二十七万多人，上台讲的共二万六千多人。现在，我们把讲用会上的部分发言，整理发表。
    遂溪县在短短几个月的时间里，在全县的范围内，掀起这样规模巨大、气势磅礴的学习运动，这是我省出现的具有伟大生命力的新事物。这一事实再一次生动地证明：工农兵群众直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新时代开始了。工农群众活学活用毛主席著作的运动，只要一加发动就如波涛澎湃。我们行将看到，全省几千万农民群众，风起云涌地投身这一伟大革命洪流。这使我们更加清楚地看到，某些资产阶级“权威”，大骂工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”和“实用主义”，这完全是反革命谬论。
    遂溪的经验又证明：广大农村基层干部和农民群众，完全能够象解放军那样，逐步变成用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有共产主义觉悟的、无产阶级化的革命队伍。农民群众学习了毛主席著作以后，他们就立即把毛主席的话当作最高指示，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的形象为榜样，自觉地改造世界观。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。由于广大干部和群众自觉地改造世界观，自觉地要做“毫不利己专门利人”的人，自觉地要以愚公精神来改天换地，就使许多所谓“老大难”问题迎刃而解。过去有退坡思想的干部，自觉地坚持革命了。过去对工作不负责任的干部，自觉地要“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务了。过去公私关系方面存在的许多问题，都按照社会主义原则顺利地解决了。在生产斗争中，过去长期办不到的事，现在很快就办到了。
    由此可见，广大农民掌握毛泽东思想，就会产生无穷的物质力量，这是在农村中取得革命和建设的胜利的最根本保证，也是在农村中防止产生修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的最重要保证。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，以及国内一小撮牛鬼蛇神，越是恶毒地污蔑、攻击、咒骂、反对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，我们的所有农村工作同志，就越要无限坚定地在全省农村掀起群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，引导全省农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！
    学习毛主席著作，树立为人民服务，为革命种田的思想
    编者按：毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。
    在我们国家里，在我们党的领导下，一切工作，都是革命的工作，都是为人民服务的。种田，也是为人民服务的，也是革命工作。为革命而种田，同为个人而种田，是两种不同的世界观。要树立为革命种田的思想，就要努力学习毛泽东思想，提高革命的自觉性。遂溪县广大农民群众，正是在活学活用毛主席著作过程中，逐步树立起这个思想，用革命精神来种田。
    彻底批判怕“蚀底”的思想
    黄立进（城月公社家寮大队坡头仔南村第三生产队队长）：我小时候，母亲改嫁到海康县客路坡仔大队西基头村，我也跟着到了那里。解放后，我当了坡仔大队的大队长。去年春，我觉得当干部“蚀底”，不如社员“自由自在”，便辞掉大队长职务，回到遂溪县城月公社家寮大队坡头仔南村第三生产队的老家。谁知第三生产队社员又要选我做队长。我坚决不做。今年春，我学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和其他语录，又学习了雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄和左凤等人的模范事迹，思想斗争就越来越激烈，吃饭不觉得香，睡觉难于睡熟。毛主席教导我们要“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，教导我们要“毫不利己专门利人”，张思德跟随毛主席十多年，还为革命去烧炭，白求恩远涉重洋来帮助我国人民革命，王杰为了掩护民兵安全而献出自己的生命，焦裕禄临终时还想着兰考的三十六万人民，左凤有六个孩子还能领导生产队改变了落后的生产面貌。而我自己呢，却是自私自利，只顾自己。我回想起自己三岁死爹，留下一身债，娘无法偿还，只好改嫁还债。解放后，我不但翻了身，日子一日好过一日，党还把我培养成为干部，如果没有共产党，没有革命，那有今天！可是，现在我却忘本，不要革命！想到这里，我不禁眼泪汪汪直流下来。我决心克服自私自利，只顾自己，不管集体的思想。我在社员大会上公开检讨了自己的错误。同时下决心领导社员改变生产队的落后面貌。那时还未春耕，我见队里没有一担肥，就带头去积肥、挖粪池。起初，社员们不听我的，我就一个人积，一个人挖，不久，社员们受感动了，就都跟我一齐积，一齐挖。
    中学毕业生就不能养牛吗？
    徐发生（城月公社家寮大队九队社员）：我小时候，学过养牛。中学毕业回来后，生产队长知道我养过牛，又叫我养牛。我愉快地接受了这个任务。有的社员说：“读了中学还回来养牛，太没出息了。”我的亲戚也劝我，说我“认字识墨”，另找一份有出息的工作来做。养牛是不是没有出息的工作呢？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》。我想张思德同志是个老战士，党叫他去烧炭就去烧炭，完全服从革命的需要，我是个贫农的孩子，工作怎能挑三拣四呢？经过学习，我进一步认识到：只要对人民有利的工作，都是高尚的工作，都是革命的工作。此后，凡是有人对我说养牛没有出息，我就对他说：“在我们社会主义国家里，只有没出息的人，没有没出息的工作。”我要为革命养好耕牛。认识提高后，我养牛也就更加落力了，天天清牛粪，垫牛栏，理草料，一年四季都是早出晚回。今年正月，有一头年岁较大的牛病倒了，许多社员都主张杀来加菜，我觉得少一头牛对生产不利，坚决反对。千方百计请兽医、找草药把牛治好。三年来，队里托我管的二十多头牛，都管得很好，没死过一头。社员说我不怕苦、不怕累，肯为生产队出力，提议给我多记两个工分。我说：“为革命多出点力气，是每个革命青年应尽的义务。”结果仍按原来每天记十工分。
    下决心为革命种一辈子田
    李瑞（草潭公社天德大队团支部书记）：在没有学习毛主席著作以前，我脑子里存有不少个人杂念，不愿意在农村耕田。去年，我在杨柑中学快毕业时，整天埋头复习英语和数、理、化，一心想考上清华大学。后来大学没有考上，心里很泄气。回到家里，人虽然在农村，心里仍然向往大学，打算在家温习一年后再去投考。当时我认为，大学毕业后出来找份工作，无论如何也比在农村劳动好得多。由于不安心农村，看不起农业劳动，所以和贫下中农也建立不起感情。后来在党支部帮助下，我学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》，初步认识到和农民结合不结合，是革命或不革命的分界线，我便开始和社员一同劳动。社员见我能放下架子，和他们一块劳动，也开始和我谈心。在和农民接触的过程中，使我进一步领会到毛主席关于青年知识分子和工农群众结合的教导，并树立了为革命种田的思想。现在，我已放弃了考大学的念头，下决心要在农村为革命种一辈子田，把自己全部力量贡献给集体。我看见那里有困难，有重活，我就到那里去，争挑重担子。
    我为什么比以前更积极劳动
    邓应瑞（城月公社竹叶塘大队下岐山第一生产队贫农组长）：我过去劳动很积极，曾经被评为县的二等劳动模范，得到二十二次奖励。一九六三年，我两个儿子病死后，我非常悲痛。心想：现在没有人接后，做工再多也无用。从此，愁愁闷闷，高兴做工就出工，不高兴做工就趁墟，没有以前那样积极了。
    去年底，我开始到文化室读毛主席的书。毛主席在《纪念白求恩》这篇文章里，教导我们要学习白求恩毫无自私自利之心的精神，做一个高尚的人，有益于人民的人。我想：我过去积极做工只是为了养育儿子，儿子死后就不愿多做工，这是打个人算盘。我应该向白求恩学习，时时想到革命，想到全世界人民，为革命种田，为人民种田，不应该只是为了儿孙去种田。此后，我比以前更积极劳动了。春耕前，我见队里缺肥，就利用早上或晚上时间外出积肥，不到两个月就为生产队积了一万三千多斤牛粪。社员们说：“应瑞叔这样积极为生产队积肥，我们怎坐得定？”暗地和我比赛。正月二十日，天气很冷，大雾弥漫，社员邓应表天未亮就担着粪箕出门，但这时我已拾了一担牛粪回来了。
    想起英雄人物我就不怕湴田了
    林少清（草潭公社天德大队岸基三队共青团员）：我在一九六二年嫁来岸基村，第一次下田，就浸到齐腰深的烂湴田里，蚂蟥满田游，吓得我差点哭起来了。我跑回娘家，见了亲人就哭着说：我嫁错地方啦！以后，凡是大忙季节，我就走回娘家，逃避劳动。前两年，我一年才做了三百多工分。
    去年冬天，我参加了县里的训练班学习毛主席著作。学了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，学了王杰同志“一不怕苦，二不怕死”的精神，我想起了自己以前的“周身怕”，心里就惭愧。我下定决心，和社员一道，改造烂湴田。
    一理通百理明。回到队里，我周身是劲。见了蚂蟥，想起王杰同志我就不怕；担沙累了，周身是湴，想起张思德、白求恩同志，我暗自说，为革命种田那怕苦和累。勇气足了，信心强了，就什么困难也不怕。这几个月来，我起早摸黑，和社员一道担沙改造湴田。现在，我们队里的烂湴田快要全部改造好了。在这期间，我一个月劳动的工分就多过以往的一年！
    一心为公，一心为集体
    编者按：毛主席教导我们，要学习白求恩同志毫无自私自利之心的精神，无论何时何地都不应该把个人利益放在第一位，而应该以个人利益服从于人民群众的利益。遂溪县广大农民群众，学习了毛主席的这些教导后，把它作为自己日常做人处事的准则，批判了自己的资产阶级个人主义思想，一心为公，一心为集体。
    在困难时刻敢于挺身而出
    陈南凤（洋青公社陈屋大队第一生产队社员）：去年底，我们队里的集体生产搞得不很好，冬种、备耕、积肥、兴修水利等工作，进度很慢。我看到这种情景，心里很焦急。我想，如果长此下去，集体经济就会遭受严重损失。怎么办呢？这时我想起毛主席的教导，在困难的时候，应该挺身而出。我就鼓足了勇气，主动出来代理队长。那时我是一个刚满十六岁的女孩子，缺乏生产经验和工作经验，不会排工，经常排错工。群众意见很大，我父亲母亲也骂我，说我“贵人不做要做贱人”，“好多管闲事”。这时我思想上也展开了斗争：继续干吧，又怕干不好，社员有意见；不干吧，这就是害怕困难，不敢迎着困难前进。想来想去，想起毛主席的教导。毛主席教导我们在碰到困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。毛主席的话坚定了我的信心。我用回忆对比的方法启发我的父母，提高他们的觉悟，使他们不但不反对我，而且成了我的生产上的参谋。我不懂得生产技术，就去学。我不懂使牛，就去请教人。现在，基本农活我都学会了。我所以能够这样做，是听毛主席的话的结果。
    我也要为大家做点好事
    梁起勤（草潭公社活港大队新村生产队贫农）：我今年六十二岁了，近几个月，队里的后生人人读毛主席的书，我也常去听听。毛主席的话句句合我的心意，我越听越爱听，越听越入心。毛主席教导大家要“毫不利己专门利人”，教导大家“为人民服务”。我听了，心里想，我这“五保”户，吃的、穿的、烧的、用的，都由大家料理得妥妥当当，原来正是毛主席出的好主意呵！我也得为大家做点好事。我下定决心，只要还有一口气，就得听毛主席的话，为大家“服”点“务”。去年十二月，队里的耕牛不见了，我天不亮就去找牛。跑了大半天，也找不着。我连饭也顾不得吃，叫齐后生仔四处找。全大队都走遍了，又到邻近的大队去，一连跑了两天，还是找不着。有的人泄气了。我想，队里正缺牛力，牛不找回来，春耕靠什么？我下定决心：那怕走到“天边”，也得把牛找回来。第三天，我跑到罗屋大队去，牛在蔗地里找到啦！我满心欢喜，把牛牵回家。噢，牛饿瘦啦！我来不及煮饭吃，先从家里拿点番薯，煮薯水给牛吃。大家表扬我关心集体财产，说：如果不是起勤叔决心大，这牛就完啦！我心里想，这有什么好表扬的，我不过是听了毛主席的话哪！
    做一个有益于人民的人
    戚大如（草潭公社东港大队北一生产队社员）：过去，我的“自发”思想比较严重，对集体生产总是半心半意，劳动挑肥拣瘦。去年冬，生产队长拿着毛主席的书，来我家里帮我学习。毛主席的话我越听越亲切，学习后，我认识到过去自己太落后了，今后必须痛下决心，挖掉“私”根，做“一个有益于人民的人”。今年初，我们队大搞积肥，我也积极参加。生产队没有运泥船，我就到杨柑公社港头村去借。他们涨潮时运，我就退潮时借来运；他们白天运，我就晚上借来运。有次刮北风，又下雨，天气很冷，我想这正是积肥的好时机，就借了船冒着风雨出海运海泥。谁知风太大，船搁了浅，撑不动。我想起毛主席关于不怕困难的教导，跳到海里，用肩把船推向深处。我这样起早摸黑，风里、雨里，用二十多天时间，给集体积了一千五百担优质海肥。
    爱护集体财产要胜过自己的
    蔡朝任（城月公社后溪大队第十生产队队长）：毛主席的书我读的不多，只读过《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇文章。毛主席在这两篇文章里，教导我们要“毫不利己专门利人”，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。我便按照毛主席的教导，时时关心社员，关心集体，关心革命，努力把生产搞好。
    今年三月九日上午，我正和十多个社员在村前积肥，突然听到村里喊救火，我丢下锄头、畚箕，急急忙忙往村里跑去。只见生产队队部附近一户社员的屋子冒着浓烟，火焰已经露出屋顶，为了抢救阶级兄弟的财产，我不顾一切地冲进屋内抢搬粮食、衣物。当我抢救出一批物资时，又听到有人喊叫队部有火灰飞入。我又爬上队部屋顶，脱掉身上的衣服，用衣服去扑灭火灰。当时是北风天，火势很猛，用衣服没法把火灰完全扑灭。我立即又跑回家，取下棉胎，浸湿水，盖到队部的屋顶上，防止了邻屋的火烧到队部来。事后，我妻子埋怨我。我对她说：“队部是全体社员的屋，屋里有二千斤晚造谷种，八百斤化肥，还有全队的农具，若是被烧掉，春耕缺农具、化肥，晚造没得种，全队七十多人一年的生活就有困难。现在救了队部，我们受点损失不算什么。”
    临危不惧
    王土保（草潭公社长洪渔业大队社员）：去年十月间，我们的渔船在公海横沙头渔场生产时，胶丝拖网在海底二、三十米深的地方给一条烂船卡住了，如果不及时抢救，这张新买的价值六百元的胶丝网和四十担左右的鱼就要损失了。怎么办呢？大工说，唯一的办法就是钻进海里去，找到网尾抽绳，把网拖开。但水深流急，下到海底危险很大。当时船上九个人中，只有一个人有下水技术，可是他已将近六十岁了，气力不足，不能下去。在这困难的面前，我记起了毛主席为人民服务的教导，勇敢地承担了下水的任务。我明知道自己的下水技术不好，下到海底有给淹死或给鲨鱼吃掉的危险，但我想，我不能为了个人的安危，白白让集体财产受损失。为了集体利益，即使不幸牺牲了，也是为了人民的利益而死的，是死得其所的。我于是打消了一切顾虑，沿着绳缆潜入海底。水很深，一连下了三次，都没有摸到网尾，鼻孔却被海水逼出血来了。但是我仍然坚持下去，直至第四次，才摸到网尾抽绳，把渔网解了出来。
    关心别人，帮助别人，做好人好事
    编者按：毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”遂溪县广大农民群众，遵照毛主席的教导，处处关心别人，帮助别人，出现了许许多多的好人好事。
    不能看着别的队有困难不管
    赵汝桐（杨柑公社松树大队燕窝第二生产队长）：过去，我只是希望把自己生产队搞好，对于别个生产队，我是不关心的。学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，我的眼睛看得宽阔一些了。前些时候，我看见有些队比较困难，我便向队委会和社员群众提议借十架牛车和一笔款给困难队。当时有些人思想不通，说：“借去了不知什么时候才收回？这不是会吃亏么？”针对这种思想，我就和大家说：白求恩同志是外国人，却毫无自私之心，全心全意支援中国革命。我们和其他困难队社员是阶级兄弟，我们队比较富裕，他们队比较穷，生产有困难，我们能看着不管吗？大家经过讨论，思想通了，一致同意支援他们。
    互相关心，互相帮助
    谭仁泽（城月公社贺嘉祉大队康塘一队队长）：春节前，我们大队开会，研究夺取今年生产大丰收的问题。当时，有几个队因为比较穷，资金不足，特别是莫家、老村等生产队，前些时候死了耕牛，急切需要款项购买，但又没有现款，希望国家给予贷款。我想起毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我想：学了毛主席的著作，就要按照毛主席的指示办事。我们生产队资金充足，车足牛强，有责任帮助穷队翻身，减轻国家负担。于是，我便同生产队干部、社员商量，拿出一些钱来支援穷队，使他们不用向国家借款。我对大家说：“我们康塘一队富裕，并不是祖宗葬中‘龙地’，更不是社员‘命水’变好，而完全是共产党领导闹革命，走集体化道路的结果。毛主席教导我们，一切革命队伍的人，都要互相关心、互相帮助，现在兄弟队有困难，我们就应该帮助他们。”老贫农谭兴福说：“解放前，我们大家都很穷。解放初期，还经常吃统销粮、救济粮，今天我们富裕了，不能就忘了国家、忘了阶级兄弟。别队有困难，应该支援。”经过讨论，大家同意拿出八百多元借给兄弟队买牛和种苗。
    把五保户当亲人
    方青（城月公社城月大队贫农青年）：今年我参加共产主义夜校学习，听了辅导员讲解毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章后，懂得了做什么事都不应当先为自己打算，而应该先为别人打算，要毫不利己，专门利人。二月间的一天晚上，天气突然转冷。我躺在床上冷得睡不着。我忽然想起我们大队的十多户五保户，不知他们够不够暖。当即披起衣服，逐户去查访，一连访了十一户。访问到邓马生大叔家的时候，发现他坐在粪桶上，连叫几声都不答话，原来是犯了急病。我马上扶他上床，见他床上、被子上都沾满了屎尿，又湿又臭，我有点犹豫了。但想起毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心”的教导，我就直奔药店，买了一些成药，又把自己的棉被抱来，把马生叔的被子换出来洗。以后，我每天都给他买药、煎药，倒屎倒尿，并为他筹集了一百多元，送他到湛江去治病。他病好后，很感激我。我说：“这是毛主席的教导。”
    处处为病人着想
    黄培芬（草潭公社长洪渔业大队保健员）：过去我看不起农村保健员工作，认为既辛苦，又没有出息。因此，对工作马马虎虎，不负责任，群众都说我“三不象”：既不象渔民，又不象后勤人员，更不象保健员。又说我“四不诊”：天气不好不出诊，黑夜急病不出诊，路远难行不出诊，不合心意不出诊。学了毛主席《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，我认识到：一事当前，先替自己打算的思想是不对的，应当学习白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”的精神。从此我按照毛主席的教导，关心群众，处处为病人着想。社员黄国高的小儿子生骨疮三年了，我无法诊治，就主动向大队借了六十元，送他去湛江医院医治。为了替他们节省路费，帮助他们解决在湛江人生路不熟的问题，我骑单车搭他母子前往。我觉得学习白求恩同志，就得象他那样毫不利己专门利人。
    冒险抢救阶级兄弟
    李世保（草潭公社长洪渔业大队社员）：去年三月间，我们渔业大队出海捕鱼。一天晚上，碰到七、八级大风，无法生产。我和其他社员都躺在舱里睡觉，忽然听到有什么东西掉到海里去了。我跑到舱面上一看，原来是杨亚养掉到海里去了。这时，风浪很大，天又很黑，下海救人，不要说十有八九救不起，甚至连自己的生命也会送掉。按照过去，碰到这种情况，一般是没有人敢去打救的了。但我一想起毛主席要我们学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的教导，什么危险也不顾了。立即和马仔杰两人划了一条小艇去抢救。我当时想，我牺牲了问题不大，但不能眼光光看着自己的阶级兄弟掉在海里淹死不救。宁愿牺牲自己，也要抢救阶级兄弟。经过和风浪一番艰苦的搏斗，我们终于把杨亚养救起来了。我们刚一上船，我们坐的小艇也给风浪打沉了。事后，有的人说，当时我们若是稍有半点个人考虑，杨亚养就没得救了。是的，要做到全心全意为人民服务，是不能有半点私心的。
    艰苦奋斗，克服困难
    编者按：毛主席教导我们，学习愚公移山精神，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。遂溪县广大农民群众，把毛主席这个教导，作为战胜困难的最锐利的武器。他们学“愚公”，当“愚公”，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，下定决心要改变贫穷面貌，让鸡毛飞上天。
    坚决不向国家伸手
    阮应钦（附城公社四九大队党支部书记）：我们队过去有一种依赖思想，不论修水利或搞生产，都要向国家伸手要钱要粮。几乎每年春季都要国家贷款几千元，供应粮几千斤。毛主席教导我们要勤俭节约，自力更生。我学习了毛主席著作之后，觉得应该听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。今年初，我提出我们队要自力更生，今年修水利不再要国家贷款和供应粮了。但这样一来，我们修水利的专业队就得吃一点番薯饭了。有些干部说：“这怎么行，还是向国家要些统销粮吧！”我想，我们农民不向国家卖粮，已经过意不去了，现在还要向国家伸手，拉国家建设的后腿，象话么？我坚决地对大家说：“修水利，不怕缺少大米，最怕缺少毛泽东思想。”于是，坚决不要国家一粒粮，并组织民工学习《为人民服务》等三篇文章和毛主席有关艰苦奋斗的语录。大家一致表示，吃番薯饭也要干到底。所有民工的情绪都很饱满，工程进度比去年春天快一倍多。
    学“愚公”，当“愚公”
    谢乃明（附城公社城东大队克山生产队长）：我原来是一个积极肯干的生产队长，在工作上也做出了一些成绩，但是从去年起，我的工作劲头差了，既不愿去开会，也不愿多过问生产队的事情。我所以这样，主要是觉得当生产队长麻麻烦烦，事情很多；又觉得年纪大了，该交班了。
    学习了毛主席《愚公移山》这篇文章后，我思想上震动很大。愚公九十岁还有勇气要搬掉两座大山，我比起愚公来还年轻得多，为什么就不想革命了呢？我回想起儿子被敌人杀害、媳妇改嫁，弄得家破人亡的悲惨历史，我就深深感到，自己搞革命搞到半途而废，太不应该了。从此，我下了决心，坚决革命到底，彻底改变生产队的面貌。
    我们队人多土地少，常年缺粮，每年要国家统销一万二千斤大米。我学了毛主席著作后，觉得老是依赖国家供应粮食不是办法，一定要闯出一条路来，使鸡毛飞上天。因此，我便积极带领社员改良土壤。有些富裕农民看见我带领社员苦干，讥讽我说：“谢乃明不管怎样做，总闯不过克山队贫穷关。”我听了并不泄气，组织社员学习毛主席关于“谁说鸡毛不能上天”的语录，结果社员群众的积极性调动起来了，经过九天的苦战，就把一块荒塘改造成九亩良田。
    这不算什么困难
    李毛洁（北坡公社北坡大队妇女主任）：我识字不多，很想学习毛主席著作，就叫我的女儿讲给我听。今年是第三个五年计划的头一年，我想办好托儿所，使女社员出勤不受小孩拖累，专心搞好生产。开始我感到困难很大，一是没地方，二是婆婆不愿意哄小孩，三是有些妇女担心托儿所管不好小孩，不愿意送孩子来托儿所。但一想起毛主席教导我们要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，我就觉得，毛主席说要“排除万难”，我办托儿所只有三个难，并没有万难。毛主席的话，使我下定决心，我便去说服婆婆和有孩子的女社员，办起托儿所来，使孩子玩得好，妈妈安心搞生产。
    定叫鸡毛飞上天
    余志超（草潭公社活港大队港头生产队队长）：我们队里土地又旱又瘦，有些社员消极悲观。有的说：生在港头，注定要挨穷啦！近几个月来，我反复同社员们一齐学了《愚公移山》，学了“谁说鸡毛不能上天”的语录，大家的心都开了窍，劲头也大了，决定在东头水闸河堵一个陂，开一条两里路长的水沟，引水灌溉全队五十多亩田。在挖沟的时候，我不顾白天黑夜带头苦干。有一天，我晕倒了。社员连忙把我扶回家，劝我休息两天再出勤。我想起了毛主席的话：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，我对大家说：我们队里的“山”还没移去呀，拿出“愚公”精神来，什么也不怕！我休息了两个钟头，又拿起锄头，坚持战斗。社员看干部。大伙说：我们也得向队长学样！于是，大伙的劲头更加足了，苦干了七天，水沟挖好了，又一鼓作气搞田园化，积肥料，早造还扩大了九亩水稻。现在，队里再也没有人悲观失望了，大家一条心，下决心苦干一年，定叫“鸡毛飞上天”！
