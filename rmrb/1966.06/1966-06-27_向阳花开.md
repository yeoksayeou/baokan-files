The bourgeois "authorities" have always looked down on workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are even more hostile to the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They try to use charges of "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism" to block the workers, peasants, and soldiers from mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In fact, their cries are in vain. The workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought, is the trend of our great era, and it is absolutely unstoppable.

The story I want to tell here is a bright flower in the garden of our glorious era. This is a flower that will forever bloom!

I
Is there really such a flower? Yes, there is. By the Hongjin River in Jiangsu, in the lush Jiangnan water town, I have seen such a flower. But I am not talking about a flower in nature, but a "sunflower" that has grown under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought.

It was last September. I participated in the socialist education movement in the Hongjin Brigade of Shaxi Commune, Taicang County. Once, the leadership asked me to talk about current events to the commune members. I accepted the task and, against the pouring rain, rushed to the Fifth Production Team. The commune members had already gathered. The big house was packed. They greeted me warmly, helped me take off my wet raincoat, and led me to the table.

Because I had been in the countryside for a short time and was staying in another production team, I was not very familiar with the situation here, and my language was not very fluent. I was always worried that I might not speak well. So, after giving an introduction, I asked a girl leaning on a rattan chair, "Is it okay to speak like this? Can you understand?"

This girl had a fair complexion with a rosy glow, short black hair that was shiny, and she was holding a pen and notebook, taking notes intently. Hearing my question, she looked up and, with a pair of particularly bright, watery eyes, looked at me affectionately and nodded slightly, meaning she understood.

The encouragement from the villagers gave me confidence, and the tight string in my heart suddenly relaxed. After finishing, a few women beside me, some holding my hand, some fixing my braid, surrounded me and brought me close to the girl. A girl introduced me, "Comrade, her name is Shen Yuying."

Shen Yuying, my heart trembled slightly. I had not been here long, but I had heard this resonant name and knew many moving legends about her. She was the daughter of a poor peasant who grew up in hardship. She was twenty-five years old. She was a good student in school and an outstanding substitute teacher in the countryside. In 1959, she responded to the Party's call to go to Xinjiang to support socialist construction on the frontier. Unfortunately, she contracted tuberculous spondylitis and became paralyzed in both legs. But she was not intimidated by the disease. Great Mao Zedong Thought gave her a new life, supporting and inspiring her to fight tenaciously against the disease. Although her body was disabled, her spirit was not. After returning home, she continued to study Chairman Mao's works and, with her own hands and mouth, continued to work for the Party. The commune members all liked her. Whenever they had time, they would come to her house to chat, discuss thoughts, and discuss production; illiterate old mothers would come to her house every day to study Chairman Mao's works; members of other teams and nearby factories and schools would often come to her house to discuss with her the experiences and insights of studying Chairman Mao's works; children who had not entered school would come to her house every day to study culture; when commune members encountered difficulties in production, they were willing to consult and discuss with her; when neighbors had disputes, they were happy to ask her to mediate and resolve them; even when children had quarrels, they would go to her to seek justice. She cared about the commune members' thoughts and often assisted the production team in studying the plans for work with a focus on politics. The commune members said: "Shen Yuying is our production team's political leader who never leaves the door!" The young people in the cultural performance program compared her to a "radiant sunflower!"

I tightly held Shen Yuying's hand and asked her, "The rain is so heavy, why did you come out?"

Shen Yuying smiled and replied:
"The socialist education movement is a class struggle. How could I not come out?"

"Sister Yuying can't walk, but she always stands at the forefront of the struggle." A girl beside her praised her.

Leaving the Fifth Team and returning to the Ninth Team where I stayed, the image of Shen Yuying still appeared in my mind. Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes." I must learn from the masses according to Chairman Mao's teachings. People like Shen Yuying, outstanding figures among the poor and lower-middle peasants, are my best teachers.

II
Soon, I went to Shen Yuying's house to visit her. She was half-lying on the bed, greeting me warmly. This was a small thatched house. On the wall opposite the door hung a familiar photo of Chairman Mao working on an airplane, and beside it were some clippings from newspapers and magazines of Chairman Mao's quotations, illustrations, and revolutionary slogans and aphorisms that she had handwritten with ink. Among all these things, a few passages from Chairman Mao's "Moving Mountains" and the heroic words of the revolutionary disabled soldiers from Sichuan stood out prominently. By Shen Yuying's pillow, neatly arranged were the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and newspapers, magazines, and notebooks. Although we had not yet talked, all these things had already introduced the owner's heart, ideals, and lifestyle to us. We talked very well, just like sisters. From that day on, this small thatched house became a place where we often studied Chairman Mao's works and talked together. As time passed, I learned more and more about Shen Yuying, this advanced figure who lived in a thatched house but had a heart for the world...

Shen Yuying had a tragic childhood. Soon after she was born, hunger and disease took away her father and sister's lives. Her mother, driven by life, remarried here with her as the only child. After liberation, it was like a dead tree coming to life. Shen Yuying, under the Party's cultivation, completed her primary and junior high school education. This poor peasant girl, from her own experiences, understood the class hatred. In her young heart, she established a firm belief: "My life is given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao. I will dedicate my life unconditionally to the revolutionary cause!"

In 1957, the Party called for strengthening the agricultural front line. Shen Yuying, who had just graduated from junior high school, eagerly took up the iron rake and went to the fields. In production, she quickly became a skilled worker, received team awards, and was awarded a third-class merit. In 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, the Party called for the establishment of many schools to cultivate the first generation of cultured peasants. She enthusiastically went to teach at a people's school. Soon, she was rated as an outstanding teacher and received county-level awards. In the summer of 1959, the Party called for young people to go to Xinjiang to support frontier construction. Under the inspiration of the glorious and great task of "turning the desert into an oasis," this nineteen-year-old Communist Youth League member, Shen Yuying, was the first to write a volunteer application to the Party branch!

First farming, then teaching, and now going to the frontier, is this chasing after the high mountains? Is this an unrealistic fantasy? No! This is the most precious character of the young people of our era. They regard the Party's needs as their first wish. Their spiritual world is the richest! Their thoughts are always surging, rolling with the whole world. Shen Yuying is such a young person.

The Party branch studied Shen Yuying's situation and approved her application. But they were also concerned about whether she could endure the hardships there. Shen Yuying noticed this and confidently said to the branch secretary, "Comrade Yang Mingsheng, you know I am a member of the school's basketball team. I am in good health and can definitely endure the hardships!"

"Just being in good health is not enough." Yang Mingsheng said, "You also need a strong will! You know, the path you have chosen is a very glorious and arduous path. There will definitely be many difficulties. Can you persist to the end?"

"Comrade Yang Mingsheng, please rest assured. No matter what difficulties I encounter, I will not retreat!"

After receiving the branch secretary's affirmative answer, Shen Yuying jumped for joy, her two small braids swinging behind her, and she rushed home.

However, her parents were reluctant to let her go. Especially her mother, as soon as she heard that she was going, tears welled up in her eyes. Shen Yuying quickly went over and said affectionately, "Mother, now we have the Party and the collective. Even if I go, I won't be without support. Besides, there is still my younger brother at home."

"You have suffered with me since you were young. Now that life is better, you are going to Xinjiang..."

"Mother, how can we only think of ourselves? You often say, 'Follow Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party.' We young people go to hard places to carry heavy burdens, so that all places and all working people can have a good life. This is what Chairman Mao said!"

"Is it what he said? Mother listens, mother listens..." Mother wiped away the tears from her face, and her kind eyes shone with joy.

Shen Yuying excitedly hugged her mother's neck and laughed happily...

On August 21, 1959, in the clanging sound of the wheels of the westbound train, the soldiers of the Mao Zedong era set out on their journey. Hundreds of young people supporting the frontier sang with uncontrollable excitement in the carriages. "Our Xinjiang is a good place..." became one of their favorite songs; they danced on the platforms of the stations along the way, and the dances of the Uyghurs became one of their favorite dances. Shen Yuying looked out of the train window at the green mountains, the green water, the vast fields, and the beautiful but somewhat unfamiliar villages. Her heart surged with emotions, and her thoughts were endless. A completely new life was about to begin. Shen Yuying could not suppress her inner excitement and took out her diary from her bag to write down a few words:

Rooted deep a thousand feet, sprouts strong and vigorous;
Swear to be a Xinjiang person, red and expert on the frontier!

III
The newly blooming flower braved the wind and snow at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains. Shen Yuying, who came from the Jiangnan water town, lived and fought very happily in Xinjiang. She was sent to a cadre training class to study. She was diligent, hardworking, and solid, and her academic performance was outstanding. She was selected as a representative to attend the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Active Supporters of Frontier Construction Conference. But who would have thought that just as she was thriving, a severe test would befall her!

It was November 1960. She had just returned to school after attending the active supporters' conference when she suddenly contracted tuberculous spondylitis, and both legs were paralyzed! After a detailed examination at the local hospital and confirmation of the diagnosis, the leadership decided to send her to Shanghai for treatment. Shen Yuying became anxious. She thought: "Before leaving, I promised the Party: always advance, never retreat. Now I am going to Shanghai. Isn't this retreating from the most glorious post? But the leadership has already made the decision, and I must obey it firmly." For the Party and the higher-ups' such meticulous care, Shen Yuying was deeply grateful. She thought, before liberation, her father and sister got sick and did not receive good treatment and lost their lives. Now she was sick, and the leadership was so concerned about her, sending her to Shanghai to the Guangci Hospital with good medical conditions for treatment. Every time she thought of these things, Shen Yuying felt her blood boiling, and she could not hold back her tears. She secretly made a firm resolution: she must strive to recover her health and use practical actions to repay the Party and Chairman Mao!

The cruel disease continued to attack her. The doctor, after a detailed examination, had to tell her: "This is a very stubborn chronic disease. You may lose the ability to walk for a long time." This news struck Shen Yuying like thunder. She became depressed and anxious, not knowing what to do.

Just at this moment, someone from Taicang came to Shanghai to visit her and brought her a most precious gift—a magazine with Chairman Mao's inscription for Wang Guanhuan. Chairman Mao wrote in the inscription: "Since you are here, you might as well stay. Don't worry about yourself at all. Let the resistance in your body grow slowly and fight it until you finally defeat it..." These words were like a beacon, illuminating Shen Yuying's heart. The poor peasant girl loved to read Chairman Mao's books the most; she loved to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Shen Yuying held the great leader's inscription with both hands, and her body was filled with boundless strength. The next day, she put aside the pain and studied Chairman Mao's works intently on her sickbed. When she read the passage in "In Memory of Norman Bethune" that said, "Our comrades must have the spirit of self-sacrifice. They must be ready to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives for the people. But we must also learn to cherish life, learn to preserve ourselves, so that we can carry on our work," her faith became even stronger. She thought: the disease forced me to return from Xinjiang to Shanghai and may force me to return to my hometown. But this does not mean retreat! The disease can destroy my body, but it can never make my thoughts retreat!

Soon, the hospital decided to let Shen Yuying return home to recuperate. She cheerfully obeyed this decision. The country gave her enough living and medical expenses, and the commune leadership also cared for her very much, often sending doctors to examine and treat her. She and her mother thanked the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts. She said: "Now I only think of one thing: to recover as soon as possible and dedicate all my strength to the Party's work!" To achieve this wish, she fought tenaciously against the disease. First, she ignored the pain and decided to be self-reliant in life. To train her arm strength, she hung a bamboo tube on the ceiling above her bed with a rope and often pulled it up and down; then, she trained her sitting endurance. After her legs were paralyzed, she could not sit for long. Now she tied a rope at the other end of the bed and sat up by pulling the rope. At first, she could not sit for an hour without her hands going numb, her waist aching, and her lower limbs convulsing. At this time, she encouraged herself: only forward, never backward! So, she tightened the rope and persisted for fifteen minutes at a time. Strong willpower made her achieve the first victory. Three months later, she could sit for four hours. She confidently thought: the lower limbs are ruined, but the hands are still good; the body is disabled, but the brain is still good. Being able to sit for four hours means I can work for the Party with my hands!

But just when her wish to work was about to be realized, her condition suddenly worsened: her left hand convulsed severely, and her brain showed abnormalities! This was another serious blow. What to do? Shen Yuying thought: could it be over like this? No! I must stand up. I must stand up like countless revolutionary martyrs in the face of death. I must stand up like the thousands and thousands of heroes of the Mao Zedong era in the face of difficulties! At this critical moment, Shen Yuying picked up Chairman Mao's works again...

"Everyone must die," Shen Yuying was suddenly attracted by these words! She had read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" countless times, but these words had never moved her heart like today. "Everyone must die, but the meaning of death is different... To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai;..."

Shen Yuying put down the book, and a great emotion surged in her heart. She thought, Zhang Zide lived and died for the revolution, and what about me? Could I just wait to die because I am disabled? No, I can't! The disease took away my freedom to walk, but it cannot take away my right to serve the people. As long as my heart is beating, I will dedicate myself completely and thoroughly to the people. Living means being useful to the people!

Some well-meaning villagers often showed pity for her. Someone said, "Yuying, don't read books. Let yourself live a few more days!" Even someone said, "You should eat more good food. After all, you..."

These words did not increase Shen Yuying's worries. She comforted the villagers and used her optimistic spirit to infect the people around her. She said to the villagers, "As long as I am alive, I will do the revolution! I will strive to work for the Party for ten years, twenty years, thirty years... The more time I work, the better. If we compare the revolutionary cause to the Hongjin River outside the window, I am just a drop of water in the river. I firmly believe: as long as I do not leave the revolutionary torrent, my life will never end!" She wrote in her diary:

Even if I can't get out of bed all my life,
The poor peasant girl's ambition is firm;
Mao Zedong Thought nurtured me,
Let the spark of life bloom forever!

Under the inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, Shen Yuying, with her revolutionary optimism, overcame the disease's repeated attacks and deeply moved the villagers who were worried about her life. The cadres and commune members of the production team enthusiastically encouraged and cared for her, making her live in the warm embrace of class friendship.

IV
The wax plum blossoms in the struggle against severe frost, revealing its color and fragrance; Shen Yuying, in the struggle against the disease, let the spark of life shine brightly.

In the blink of an eye, Shen Yuying had spent five years on her sickbed. In these five years, she fought against the disease on one front and fought against various杂念 in her mind on another. These two fronts were closely connected. The stronger her thoughts, the less painful the disease; the slightest杂念 in her thoughts, the more rampant the disease. In this struggle between willpower and disease, Shen Yuying deeply felt: the sharpest weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. She used this weapon to fight tenaciously against the disease. Her physical condition began to improve, the brain abnormalities stabilized, and her left hand no longer convulsed. Mao Zedong Thought produced a great material force in her! Therefore, her class feelings for Chairman Mao's works became even deeper. Especially since the socialist education movement, in the high tide of the masses studying Chairman Mao's works, she studied Chairman Mao's works even more actively. She read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" volumes one to four. Some articles she read over and over again. Once, she studied "Oppose Party Formalism" and saw this passage: "Who is a propagandist? Not only teachers are propagandists, but also news reporters, literary workers, and all our cadres are propagandists. As long as a person speaks to others, he is doing propaganda work. As long as he is not dumb, he will always have something to say." This passage gave Shen Yuying great encouragement and inspiration. She thought: I am not worried about not being able to work for the Party? My legs are broken, but I still have hands and a mouth. Why can't I, as Chairman Mao instructed, do propaganda work and be a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought?

From then on, she became more optimistic and often propagated Mao Zedong Thought through teaching songs, giving lectures, and other opportunities. Whenever the villagers came to her house, she enthusiastically helped others study Chairman Mao's works. In August 1965, the young commune members of the Fifth Team organized themselves, and under the leadership of the Party branch, Shen Yuying actively assisted the group leader in organizing the youth and children to study Chairman Mao's works, helping them establish a study system, and making them persist in studying. She, with all her heart, helped the youth study Mao Zedong Thought. During the busy farming season, she would select Chairman Mao's quotations related to the current thoughts and work and give them to everyone to study. She also wrote Chairman Mao's quotations on a small blackboard and asked other youth to take them to the fields and workplaces. The youth and children studied Chairman Mao's works and did many good deeds. Everyone could recite a few of Chairman Mao's quotations and use them to guide their thoughts and actions at any time. Once, the Young Pioneers Shen Guoyuan, Liu Genliang, and Su Jinyuan went to the town to watch a movie. On the way, they met an old man carrying a load of broken pots, looking very tired. At this time, they thought of what Sister Yuying taught them to be as selfless as Norman Bethune to comrades, and they actively helped the old man carry the pots, all the way to the old man's home. As a result, when they went to the movie theater, the ticket collector saw them in this state and did not let them in. Only after they explained the situation did the ticket collector let them in and praised them as Chairman Mao's good children. Shen Yuying not only helped the youth and children but also helped the elderly. She and the poor peasant old mother, Communist Party member Jin Xiaomei, signed a "contract": this old mother would come to Shen Yuying's house every day to study one of Chairman Mao's quotations.

Shen Yuying lectured on Chairman Mao's works, with full emotions and vivid language, and the villagers were happy to listen. To make Chairman Mao's works better, Shen Yuying often took the opportunity when people came to her house to chat to understand the production situation and the commune members' active thoughts. When organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, she would target these active thoughts for propaganda. Once, she heard that the young man Guan Huizhong was calculating work points during labor and did not care about quality. She first had a sincere heart-to-heart talk with Guan Huizhong and then studied a passage from Chairman Mao with him: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when they think of them. Can we still not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" Then Shen Yuying wrote this passage on a small blackboard and asked someone to take it to the fields. Guan Huizhong sighed, "Yes, calculating work points is really not appropriate!"

Although Guan Huizhong realized his shortcomings, Shen Yuying was still not at ease. She found out through inquiries that Guan Huizhong's thoughts were "building a house, marrying a wife, having a son." She felt that some young people's revolutionary worldview had not been truly established. So, she organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again and gave Guan Huizhong the book "Live Like Him." Under her enthusiastic and patient help, Guan Huizhong's thoughts made great progress, and soon he joined the Communist Youth League.

The spirit of Norman Bethune's extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people, and Lei Feng's warmth for comrades like spring, gave Shen Yuying great inspiration. She said, as long as I live, I want to care for comrades and love the people like Norman Bethune and Lei Feng. She saw that some cadres in the production team were busy with work and actively assisted them in doing some work; when a family in the team encountered difficulties, she would try her best to help solve them. She composed and performed programs for the commune members, taught the youth to sing, and took on all the work she could do. Therefore, the commune members were willing to share their thoughts with her. Commune member Shen Heisen's family encountered some temporary difficulties in life, and he had a slight misunderstanding with a cadre, so he wrote down his inner grief in a few words: "With the old above and the young below, a medicine bag at the waist; sick and troubled, always feeling abandoned." He sent it to Shen Yuying. She found out the cause and patiently talked to him, also writing a note: "Don't be afraid of the old, don't be afraid of the young, the Party and the masses are the support; the leader's words are like elixir, class brothers cannot be abandoned." Shen Yuying and the cadres and masses of the production team also helped him patiently and studied Chairman Mao's works with him. Shen Heisen's knot in his heart was finally untied, and he actively participated in production labor.

Shen Yuying was very warm to comrades, but she was merciless to class enemies and bourgeois ideology. She could not walk, but she always stood at the forefront of the class struggle in the countryside. In the socialist education movement, she firmly exposed and fought against bad people and bad deeds. Some people who were exposed and criticized by her said behind her back, "The body is like a broken boat, the mouth is like an iron clamp!" Shen Yuying heard this and was very happy. She said: "Chairman Mao said, being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. They curse me, which shows that I have hit their vital spot. Revolutionaries are not afraid of being cursed by the enemy. The more they curse, the more we must revolutionize. In the current domestic and international class struggle situation, we must firmly fight against all ghosts and monsters, whether they are imperialism, revisionism, or domestic class enemies, they must be thoroughly defeated, without mercy! My body is not good, but I am not disabled in spirit. I will use my mouth and pen to fight tenaciously against the enemy. I will dedicate my whole life to the Party, to the cause of socialism and communism, and will not allow anyone to sabotage our revolutionary cause!"

V
One morning in spring, a brilliant sunrise rose over the Hongjin River. All the active members of studying Chairman Mao's works, the five-good members, the five-good youth, the five-good militiamen, the three-good women, and the outstanding Young Pioneers from the fourteen production teams of the entire Hongjin Brigade gathered in the courtyard of the brigade headquarters, facing the sunrise. The young Communist Youth League members of the Fifth Team had already brought Shen Yuying early. Everyone tightly surrounded her, greeting and chatting, and Shen Yuying's rosy face was filled with smiles. Seeing this lively scene, I couldn't help but think of Chairman Mao's great poem:

When the mountain flowers bloom brightly,
She smiles in the crowd.

Yes, Shen Yuying is just like a red and radiant sunflower!

On March 3, it was the day Shen Yuying gained a new and more fulfilling life. On that day, it was still in the small courtyard of the brigade headquarters. The Party branch meeting discussed Shen Yuying's application to join the Party. I was sitting next to her at that time, and I seemed to feel her heart beating. Before the meeting officially began, I asked her, "Sister Yuying, what are you thinking?"

"I am thinking, today is really a coincidence on top of a coincidence! Ten years ago on March 3, I joined the League; today on March 3, they are discussing my application to join the Party. March 3 has become the most unforgettable day for me! After joining the Party, the burden on my shoulders will be heavier. In the next ten years, twenty years, and even longer, I will use the highest standard of a Communist Party member to demand of myself, to better read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be a good member of Chairman Mao. Dedicate my life to the glorious cause of communism." Listening to this voice from the heart of a poor peasant girl, I was deeply moved and couldn't think of any better words to congratulate her. I took out my most beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and gave it to her. She tightly held my hand, and for a moment, she was so moved that she couldn't speak...

In the unanimous raising of hands and a burst of applause, Shen Yuying was approved to join the Party! At this moment, I saw two tears the size of pearls rolling in her eyes. At this moment, I shared her great happiness. On this day, Shen Yuying also wrote in her notebook her voice at that time:

The flowers bloom with a thousand fragrances, and the fruits last for ten thousand years;
Following Chairman Mao, forever towards the Party!

    向阳花开
    林豆豆
    资产阶级“权威”们，一向是看不起工农兵的。他们对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作更是仇视，妄图用什么“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的罪名，来阻挡工农兵掌握伟大的毛泽东思想。其实，他们的叫嚷是徒劳的。工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，掌握和运用毛泽东思想是我们伟大时代的潮流，是绝对阻挡不住的。
    这里我要讲的故事，就是在我们这个光辉灿烂的时代，万花丛中的一朵鲜花。这是一朵永远灿烂的鲜花！
     一
    真的有这样的花吗？有的，在江苏洪泾河畔，在那绿葱葱的江南水乡，我见到过这样的花。不过，我说的不是自然界的花，而是在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下成长起来的“向阳花”。
    那是去年九月，我在太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队参加社会主义教育运动。有一次，领导上叫我给社员们讲讲时事，我接受了任务，迎着滂沱大雨赶到第五生产队时，社员们早集合齐了。大屋里挤得水泄不通。他们热情地同我打着招呼，帮我脱去湿淋淋的雨衣，把我让到桌前。
    因为我到农村不久，又是住在别的生产队，对这里的情况不太熟悉，语言又不大通，总担心讲不好。所以讲了一个开头，我就问斜靠在藤椅上的一位姑娘：“这样讲行不行，听得懂吗？”
    这姑娘白晰的脸庞上透着红润，齐耳短发乌黑油亮，手里拿着笔和本子，正在聚精会神地记笔记。听见我的问话，她抬起头来，用一双特别有神的水汪汪的大眼，亲昵地看着我，轻轻点了点头，意思是说她听懂了。
    乡亲们的鼓励，给我增加了信心，我心里绷紧的弦一下松了下来。讲完后，身旁几位妇女有的拉着我的手，有的理着我的辫子，把我簇拥到那位姑娘近旁。一位姑娘向我介绍说，“同志，她叫沈玉英。”
    沈玉英，我心里微微震动了一下。我到这里不久，就听到了这个响亮的名字，知道了许多关于她的动人的传说。她是在苦水里长大的贫农的女儿，二十五岁了。她在学校是好学生，在乡村是出色的代课教师。一九五九年她响应党的号召，到新疆去支援边疆的社会主义建设，不幸得了结核性脊椎炎，下肢瘫痪了。但她并没有被疾病吓倒，伟大的毛泽东思想给了她新的生命，支持着她，鼓舞着她，与疾病进行了顽强的斗争。她身残志不残，回到家乡后，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作，并用自己的手、自己的口，继续为党工作。社员们都很喜欢她，一有空就到她屋里来聊天，谈思想，谈生产；不识字的老妈妈每天到她屋里来学习毛主席著作；别队的社员和附近工厂、学校的工人、学生，也经常到她屋里去同她交谈学习毛主席著作的心得、体会；没有进学校的儿童每天到她屋里来学习文化；社员们生产上遇到了困难愿意找她商量、研究；乡亲们之间发生了纠纷也高兴请她调停、解决；就连孩子们发生了口角的事，也都主动去找她评理。她关心社员们的思想，经常协助生产队研究突出政治的工作计划。社员们说：“沈玉英是我们生产队不出门的政治队长！”青年们在编演的文娱节目中把她比喻为“灿烂的向阳花！”
    我紧紧握着沈玉英的手，问她：“落雨这么大，为啥还出来？”
    沈玉英笑吟吟地回答说：
    “社教运动是阶级斗争，我哪能不出来？”
    “玉英姐不能跑路，可总站在斗争最前边。”旁边一位姑娘夸赞着她。
    离开五队，回到我所在的九队，沈玉英的形象仍然在我的脑海浮现。毛主席说，“群众是真正的英雄”。我要按照毛主席的教导认真向群众学习。象沈玉英这样的贫下中农中的优秀人物，正是我最好的老师。

    不久，我到沈玉英屋里去看她。她半躺在床上，热情地同我打招呼。这是一间不大的草屋，迎面墙上悬着我们常见的那张毛主席在飞机上工作的照片，旁边贴着一些从报章杂志上剪下来的毛主席语录、画页，以及她亲手用墨笔抄写的革命的名言、警句。在这一切东西里面，毛主席《愚公移山》里的几段话和四川革命残废军人们的豪言壮语，占着十分引人注目的位置。在沈玉英躺着的枕边，整齐地摆着《毛泽东选集》以及报纸、杂志、日记本。虽然还没有交谈，但这一切已经向我们介绍着主人的胸怀、理想和生活情趣。我们谈得很好，就象亲姐妹一样。从这一天开始，这间小茅屋就成了我们经常一起学习毛主席著作和谈心的地方。时间久了，关于沈玉英这样一位身居茅屋、心怀天下的先进人物，我了解得越来越多……
    沈玉英有一个悲惨的童年。她出生不久，饥饿和病魔就夺去了她爹爹和姐姐的生命，妈妈被生活所迫，带着她这根在风雨中出世的独苗改嫁到这里。解放以后，犹如枯木逢春，沈玉英在党的培养下，念完了小学和初中。这个贫农女儿从自己的切身经历中懂得了阶级的爱憎。在她幼小心灵里，树起了一个坚定不移的信念：“我的生命是党和毛主席给我的，我要把自己的生命无条件地献给革命事业！”
    一九五七年党号召加强农业第一线，初中刚毕业的沈玉英，就迫不及待地扛着铁耙下田了。在生产中她很快成为一把好手，受到了队里奖励，还立了三等功；一九五八年大跃进，党号召大办民校，培养第一代有文化的农民，她又满腔热忱地到民办小学教书，不久被评为优秀教师，还受到县里的奖励；一九五九年夏天，党号召青年人到新疆支援边疆建设，在“变沙漠为绿洲”这个光荣而伟大的任务鼓舞下，这位十九岁的共青团员沈玉英，第一个给党支部写了志愿申请书！
    忽儿种田、忽儿教书，现在又要到边疆去，这是这山望着那山高么？这是不切实际的幻想么？不！这正是我们这个时代年轻人最宝贵的性格。他们把党的需要当做自己的第一志愿，他们的精神世界最丰富！他们的思想里经常波澜滚滚，翻腾着整个世界。沈玉英就是这样一位青年。
    党支部研究了沈玉英的情况，批准了她的申请。但是又担心她能不能吃得那里的苦。沈玉英看出了这一点，满怀信心地对支部书记说：“杨明生同志，你知道我是学校里篮球代表队的队员，我身体很好，一定经受得住！”
    “光身体好还不够。”杨明生说，“还要有坚强的意志呵！要知道，你选择的这条道路，是一条非常光荣、非常艰巨的道路，困难一定是不少的，你能坚持走到底吗？”
    “杨明生同志，你放心吧，不管碰上什么困难，我决不后退！”
    当得到支书的肯定答复之后，沈玉英乐得跳起来，两条小辫往身后一甩，飞一样地奔回家去。
    爹妈却舍不得她走。尤其妈妈，一听说她要走，眼眶里便湿浠浠地滴出泪来。沈玉英忙走过去，亲切地说：“妈妈，现在有党、有集体，我走了还怕没有依靠？再说，屋里还有弟弟呀。”
    “你从小跟妈妈受罪，现在日子好过了，你又要到新疆……”
    “妈妈，哪能光想自家？你常讲，要‘听毛主席的话，跟共产党走’，我们青年到艰苦的地方去挑重担子，为的是要所有地方、所有劳动人民都过好日子，这是毛主席说的呀！”
    “是他老人家讲的？妈妈听，妈妈听……”妈妈擦去脸上的泪花，慈祥的眼里闪出喜悦的光。
    沈玉英激动地搂住妈妈的脖子，高兴得笑了……
    一九五九年八月二十一日，在西行列车铿锵的车轮滚动声中，毛泽东时代的战士踏上了征途。千百个支援边疆的青年怀着难以抑制的兴奋心情在车厢里唱歌。“咱们新疆好地方……”成为他们最爱唱的歌曲之一；他们在中途的车站月台上跳舞，维吾尔族的舞蹈成为他们最爱跳的舞蹈之一。沈玉英望着车窗外面那青的山，绿的水，大片的田野，美丽但又有点陌生的村镇，心潮汹涌，思绪万端。完全崭新的生活就要开始了。沈玉英抑制不住自己内心的激动，从书包里掏出日记本来，写下了这样几句话：
    扎根深千丈，发芽茁又壮；
    誓作新疆人，红专在边疆！
    三
    刚刚开放的花儿，挺住了天山脚下的风雪。来自江南水乡的沈玉英，在新疆生活得很愉快，战斗得很出色。她被选派到干部训练班去学习。她勤奋、刻苦、扎实，学习成绩十分突出，被评选为全校出席新疆维吾尔自治区支援边疆积极分子代表大会的代表。可是，万万没有想到，正在她茁壮成长的时候，严峻的考验降临在她身上！
    那是一九六○年十一月，她参加积极分子会议回校不久，正满腔热忱地准备奔向工作岗位的时候，突然患了结核性脊椎炎，两条腿瘫痪了！在当地医院检查、确诊之后，领导上决定急速送她到上海去治疗。沈玉英心里着急起来，她想：“出发之前，我曾向党保证：永远前进、决不后退，现在要去上海，这不是从最光荣的岗位上后退了吗？但是，领导上已经作了决定，我一定要坚决服从。”对于党和上级这样无微不至的关怀，沈玉英万分感激。她想，解放前，爹爹、姐姐生病，得不到很好治疗，丧失了性命，现在自己得了病，领导上却这样关怀自己，用飞机送自己到医疗条件很好的上海广慈医院去治疗。每想到这些，沈玉英就感到浑身热血沸腾，止不住热泪盈眶。她暗暗下定决心：一定争取早日恢复健康，用实际行动来报答党和毛主席！
    残酷的病魔，继续向她袭击。医生做完详细检查，不得不告诉她：“这是一种很顽固的慢性病，可能要长期失去行走的能力。”这消息象霹雳一样震动了沈玉英的心。她顿时悲观焦急起来，不知道怎么办好。
    就在这个时候，太仓有人来上海看望她，给她带来了一份最最珍贵的礼物——刊登着毛主席给王观澜同志题词的杂志。毛主席在题词上说的“既来之，则安之，自己完全不着急，让体内慢慢生长抵抗力和它作斗争直至最后战而胜之，……”这段话，象明灯一样，照亮了沈玉英的心。毛主席的书，贫农女儿最爱读；毛主席的话，贫农女儿最爱听。沈玉英双手捧着伟大领袖的题词，浑身增添了无穷的力量。第二天，她把病痛撇在一边，在病床上专心地读起毛主席著作来。当她读到《为人民服务》一文中写的“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”她的信心更加坚强了。她想：病魔迫使我从新疆回到上海，还可能迫使我从上海回到家乡。但这决不等于后退！病魔可以摧毁我的身体，但它永远不能使我的思想后退！
    不久，医院确定让沈玉英回乡休养。她愉快地服从了这一决定。国家给了她足够的生活费和医疗费，公社领导对她也非常关心，经常派医生来给她进行诊治。她和她的妈妈从内心里感谢党和毛主席。她说：“我现在心里只想一件事：早日痊愈，用自己全部的精力为党工作！”为了实现这一愿望，她对病魔展开了顽强搏斗。首先，她不顾病痛缠身，决心要做到生活自理。为了锻炼臂力，她在睡床上方的天棚上用绳子吊了一个竹筒，经常在上面拉上拉下；接着，她又锻炼长坐的能力。两腿瘫痪以后，坐的时间稍长也不行。现在她在床的另一端系上一条绳子，拉住绳子坐起来。开始，她坐不到一个小时就手麻、腰痛，下肢抽搐。这时她便自己鼓励自己：只能前进，决不后退！于是，她又拉紧绳子，一刻钟、一刻钟地坚持。坚强的毅力使她取得了第一个胜利。三个月之后，她就能坚持坐上四个小时了。她满怀信心地想：下肢坏了，双手还好；身体残了，脑子还好。能坚持坐四个小时，我就可以用双手为党工作！
    可是，正当她渴望工作的愿望即将实现的时候，病情突然恶化了：左手严重抽搐，大脑也发现病变！这又是一个严重的打击。怎么办？沈玉英想：难道就这样完了吗？不！决不能！我要站起来，我要象无数革命先烈那样在死亡面前坚强地站起来，要象毛泽东时代的千千万万个英雄人物那样迎着困难站起来！在这关键性的时刻，沈玉英又拿起了毛主席著作……
    “人总是要死的”，沈玉英突然被这几个字吸引住了！《为人民服务》这篇文章她看过无数遍，但这几个字却从来没有象今天这样打动她的心。“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。……为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；……”
    沈玉英放下书，一种崇高的感情洪流在她的心中奔腾。她想，张思德为革命而生为革命而死，我呢？难道就因残废而等死吗？不，不能！病魔夺去了我走路的自由，但无法夺去我为人民服务的权利。只要我的心脏在跳动，我就要完全、彻底地为人民尽力。活着就应该对人民有用！
    有些好心的乡亲，常流露出怜悯她的心情。有人说：“玉英，不要看书，让自己多活几日吧！”甚至有人还说：“你就多吃一点好的，总归是……”
    这些话，并没有增加沈玉英的烦恼，她安慰乡亲们，用自己的乐观精神来感染周围的人们。她对乡亲们说：“我只要活着，就要干革命！我还要争取为党工作十年、二十年、三十年……工作得时间越多越好。假如把革命事业比做窗外的洪泾河，我只不过是河里的一颗水珠。我深信：只要自己不离开革命的洪流，生命就永远不会完结！”她在日记里写过这样的话：
    尽管终生起不了床，
    贫农女儿志向要坚强；
    毛泽东思想哺育了我，
    让生命火花永远开放！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞下，沈玉英以革命乐观主义精神，战胜了一次又一次病魔的侵袭，同时也深深地感动了为她的生命而担心的乡亲们。生产队的干部和社员们，热情地鼓励她，关心她，使她生活在阶级友爱的温暖之中。
    四
    蜡梅在同严霜苦斗中，吐露出了自己的花色香气；沈玉英在同病魔鏖战中，生命的火花放射出了夺目的光彩。
    转眼间，沈玉英在病床上已经度过了五个年头。五年间，她一面同疾病作斗争，一面同自己思想上各种杂念作斗争。这两条战线，又是紧紧连结在一起的。思想坚强了，病痛程度就大大减轻；思想稍稍有一点杂念，病魔就猖獗起来。在这场意志和疾病的搏斗当中，沈玉英深深感到：最锐利的武器，是毛泽东思想。她运用这一武器，同疾病进行了坚决斗争。身体情况开始有了好转，大脑病变得到稳定，左手也不再抽搐。毛泽东思想在她身上产生了巨大的物质力量！因此，她对毛主席著作的阶级感情越发深厚。特别是社教运动以来，在群众的大学毛主席著作运动的高潮当中，她更加积极地学习毛主席著作。她读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷。其中的有些文章，她反复读了许多遍。有一次，她学习《反对党八股》一文，看到这样一段话：“什么是宣传家？不但教员是宣传家，新闻记者是宣传家，文艺作者是宣传家，我们的一切工作干部也都是宣传家。……一个人只要他对别人讲话，他就是在做宣传工作。只要他不是哑巴，他就总有几句话要讲的。”这段话，给了沈玉英很大鼓舞和启发。她想：我不是正在苦恼自己不能为党工作吗？我的腿坏了，不是还有手还有嘴巴吗？我为什么不可以象毛主席所指示的那样作宣传工作，做一个毛泽东思想的宣传员呢？
    从此以后，她变得更加乐观，经常通过教歌、讲课和其他一切机会宣传毛泽东思想，只要乡亲们到她屋里来，她就热情地帮助别人学习毛主席著作。一九六五年八月间，五队的青年社员组织起来了，在党支部的领导下，沈玉英主动协助小组长，组织青年和儿童们学习毛主席著作，帮助他们建立了学习制度，使他们经常坚持学习；她以满腔热情，帮助青年学习毛泽东思想。农忙的时候，她便结合当前的思想、工作，选出毛主席的语录给大家学。她还把毛主席的语录写在小黑板上，请别的青年带到田头、场头。青年和儿童们学习了毛主席著作，出现了大量的好人好事，人人都能背诵几条毛主席语录，随时用以指导自己的思想和行动。有一次，少先队员沈国元、刘根良、苏金元三人到镇子上去看电影，路上遇到一位老人挑着一担破锅，很吃力。这时他们想到玉英姐教他们要象白求恩那样对同志极端热忱的话，便主动帮助老人背锅，一直送到老人家里，结果他们弄了满头满脸黑灰。三个小朋友到电影院看电影时，收票员看他们这个样子，不让进场。直到他们说明了情况，收票员才放他们进去，还表扬他们是毛主席的好孩子。沈玉英不仅帮助青年和儿童们，也帮助老年人。她和贫农老妈妈、共产党员金小妹订立了“合同”：这位老妈妈每天都要到沈玉英屋里学习一条毛主席语录。
    沈玉英讲毛主席著作，感情饱满，语言生动，乡亲们都高兴听。为了把毛主席著作讲得更好，沈玉英经常利用人们到她屋里聊天的机会，了解生产情况，了解社员们的活思想，在组织大家学习毛主席著作的时候，她就针对这些活思想进行宣传工作。有一次，她听说青年管惠中劳动时计较工分，不讲究质量，她先同管惠中诚恳地谈心，又和他一起学习了毛主席的一段话：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”然后沈玉英又把这段话写在小黑板上，请人送到田头。管惠中很感慨地说：“是呀，计较工分实在太不应该！”
    管惠中虽然认识了缺点，但沈玉英还不放心。她通过向别人调查，知道了管惠中的思想是“盖房子，讨娘子，抱儿子”，她感到青年中有些人的革命人生观还没有真正树立起来。于是，她再一次组织大伙学习《为人民服务》，又把《象他那样生活》一书给管惠中看。在她热情、耐心地帮助下，管惠中思想有了很大进步，不久便加入了共青团。
    白求恩对同志对人民极端热忱的精神，雷锋对同志象春天般温暖的精神，都给了沈玉英极大的启示。她说，只要我活一天，就要象白求恩和雷锋那样关心同志，爱护人民。她看到生产队有的干部工作忙，便主动协助他们做些工作；队里那家那户遇到了困难，她总是尽量想法帮助解决。她为社员们编演唱节目，教青年们唱歌，凡是她能做的事，她都主动地承担起来。因此，社员们遇到啥事，也愿同她说心里话。社员沈和森家里生活上暂时遇到一些困难，加上同一位干部发生了一点误会，便把自己心里的苦闷编了这样几句话：“上有老，下有小，腰间有个药壶包；病缠身，常苦恼，自己总感被人抛。”送给沈玉英。她弄清了原因，便耐心地同他进行谈话，也写了一张纸条：“不怕老，不怕小，党和群众是依靠；领袖话，赛灵药，阶级弟兄谁也不能抛。”沈玉英和生产队的干部、群众，又对他进行了耐心帮助，并和他一同学习毛主席著作，沈和森的思想疙瘩终于解开了，积极参加了生产劳动。
    沈玉英对同志是非常温暖的，对阶级敌人和资产阶级思想却毫不容情。她不能走路，但总是站在农村阶级斗争的最前面。在社会主义教育运动中，她对坏人坏事进行了坚决的揭露和斗争。个别受到她揭露和批判的人背后讽刺她说：“身体象破船，嘴巴象铁钳！”沈玉英听到这话反而很高兴，她说：“毛主席说过，被敌人反对是好事，不是坏事。他们骂我，正说明我打中了他们的要害。革命者是不怕敌人骂的。他们越骂，我们越要革命。在当前国内外尖锐的阶级斗争形势下，对一切牛鬼蛇神就是要坚决斗争，不管它是帝国主义、修正主义，还是国内的阶级敌人，都必须彻底打倒，决不留情！我的身体虽然不好，但我人残志不残，我要用自己的嘴，用自己的笔，同敌人进行坚决斗争。我要把自己毕生精力献给党，献给社会主义、共产主义的革命事业，决不允许任何人对我们的革命事业进行破坏！”
    五
    今年春天的一个早晨，洪泾河上升起一片绚烂的朝霞。全洪泾大队十四个生产队的学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好社员、五好青年、五好民兵、三好妇女代表和优秀的少先队员们，迎着朝霞，云集到大队部的场院里开会。五队的共青团员老早就把沈玉英送来了，大伙紧紧把她围起来，问候、谈笑，沈玉英红彤彤的脸庞上，挂着笑容。看着这个生气勃勃的场景，我不禁想起了毛主席的伟大诗句：
    待到山花烂熳时，
    她在丛中笑。
    是的，沈玉英多么象是一朵红艳艳的报春花啊！
    三月三日，是沈玉英获得新的、更加充实的生命的一天。这天，还是在大队部的那个不大的场院里，党支部大会讨论沈玉英同志的入党问题。我当时紧紧靠着她的身边坐着，我似乎感觉到她的心在怦怦跳动。会议还没有正式开始的时候，我问她：“玉英姐，你在想啥？”
    “我在想，今朝真是巧头加巧头！十年前的三月三日，我入了团；今朝三月三日，又讨论我入党。三月三，成了我最最难忘的日子！入党以后，肩上的担子更重了，今后十年、二十年、以至更长的时间，我要用一个共产党员的最高标准来要求自己，要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好社员。把自己的一生都献给壮丽的共产主义事业。”我倾听着这发自贫农女儿肺腑的声音，激动万分，再也想不出什么更好的语言来向她祝贺，我掏出自己最最心爱的《毛主席语录》送给了她，她紧紧握住我的手，一时激动得说不出话来。……
    在一致举手和一片掌声之中，沈玉英被通过入党了！这时候，我看见两颗玉籽般大的晶莹的泪珠在她的眼眶里滚动。此时此刻我分享着她的巨大幸福。就在这一天，沈玉英在日记本上又写下了她当时的心声：
    花开千里香，结果万年长；
    跟着毛主席，永远向着党！
