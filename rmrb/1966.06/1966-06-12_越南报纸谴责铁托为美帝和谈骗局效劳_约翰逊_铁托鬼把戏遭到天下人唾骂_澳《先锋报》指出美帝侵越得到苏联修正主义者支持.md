    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 10th – Vietnamese newspapers *Nhan Dan* and *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* respectively published commentaries on the 10th, strongly condemning the traitor Tito for going all out to serve the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The commentary said that on June 7th, Tito once again brought out the "Belgrade Appeal" issued by seventeen non-aligned countries on the Vietnam issue last March 17th, praising the United States and attacking Vietnam and China. Tito did this to curry favor with US imperialism and ask for rewards.
    The *Nhan Dan* commentary, after listing a large number of facts of Tito serving US imperialism, said that the series of actions taken by Tito on the Vietnam issue clearly exposed his position of supporting US imperialism in sabotaging the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, invading Vietnam, and dividing Vietnam for a long time.
    The commentary pointed out that Tito's reactionary stance on the Vietnam issue has been severely condemned by broad world opinion.
    The commentary said that it is clear that on the Vietnam issue, Tito played the despicable role of peddling "unconditional discussions" for the US imperialist aggressors. Tito also attempted to help the American robbers escape their predicament in Vietnam and reduce their isolation in the world. Tito is a dog who is utterly devoted to his American masters. The United States has praised Tito and given him very generous rewards.
    The commentary said that the Vietnamese people resolutely expose Tito's despicable face and strongly condemn his means of serving the US aggression against Vietnam and the US deception of the world's people. The *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* commentary exposed the traitor Tito's fallacies such as "Yugoslavia is going all out to stop the war in Vietnam," saying that although Tito's words were very pleasant to hear, he never dared to point out that the United States was the aggressor, and he did not dare to stand on the side of the victims of aggression to condemn the aggressors, and as a result, he only repeated the tune of his American masters.
    The commentary pointed out that the Tito clique, trapped in the quagmire of modern revisionism and with its head in the noose of the United States, has completely betrayed the revolutionary traditions of the Yugoslav people. He himself is afraid of struggle and wants to prevent others from carrying out the anti-US struggle.
    The commentary concluded that the Johnson-Tito acrobatics troupe's deceptive "peace" farce can only be more and more despised by the people of the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, June 9th – The *Vanguard*, published on the 9th, pointed out that the United States will increase its troops in Vietnam to 400,000 by the end of this year, and is asking its "allies" to provide more assistance, but at the same time, it is continuing to talk about peace and negotiations.
    The newspaper said: "It is clear that the US talk about peace is a complete and utter fraud."
    The *Vanguard* emphasized that if US imperialism did not have the actual support of the Soviet revisionists, it would have been forced to get out of Vietnam long ago.
    The *Vanguard* said: "But the Soviet revisionists are encouraging it. They are even threatening to aggress against the number one enemy of US imperialism—China."
    The newspaper pointed out that Australia has now been tied to the American war chariot. At this time, the only path for the Australian people is to develop the broadest united front against US imperialism and its puppets, including the likes of Calwell and the Aarons revisionist group; while the Soviet revisionists are attempting to undermine the international united front against US imperialism, this revisionist group is attempting to undermine the development of the Australian united front. The *Vanguard* said, but all their plots will be defeated. "Those who now pretend to oppose US imperialism, but are actually serving US imperialism, will soon be completely exposed. They are now increasingly being exposed."

### 越南报纸谴责铁托为美帝和谈骗局效劳  约翰逊—铁托鬼把戏遭到天下人唾骂  澳《先锋报》指出美帝侵越得到苏联修正主义者支持

    越南报纸谴责铁托为美帝和谈骗局效劳
    约翰逊—铁托鬼把戏遭到天下人唾骂
    澳《先锋报》指出美帝侵越得到苏联修正主义者支持
    新华社河内十日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》十日分别发表评论，强烈谴责叛徒铁托全力以赴地为美帝国主义对越南的侵略战争效劳。
    评论说，六月七日，铁托又重新把去年三月十七个不结盟国家就越南问题发表的“贝尔格莱德呼吁书”端出来，赞扬美国，攻击越南和中国。铁托这样做，是为了向美帝国主义邀功请赏。
    《人民报》的评论在列举铁托为美帝国主义效劳的大量事实后说，铁托就越南问题所采取的一系列行动，清楚地暴露了他的立场是支持美帝国主义破坏关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，侵略越南，长期分割越南。
    评论指出，铁托关于越南问题的反动立场遭到世界广泛舆论的严厉谴责。
    评论说，很明显，在越南问题上，铁托扮演了为美帝国主义侵略者兜售“无条件讨论”的可耻角色。铁托还企图帮助美国强盗摆脱在越南的窘境和减少在世界上的孤立处境。铁托正是对美国主子鞠躬尽瘁的走狗。美国对铁托赞不绝口，并给他十分优厚的奖赏。
    评论说，越南人民坚决揭露铁托的卑鄙面目和强烈谴责他为美国侵略越南和美国欺骗世界人民效劳的手段。《人民军队报》的评论揭露叛徒铁托所谓“南斯拉夫正为停止在越南的战争而全力以赴”等谰言说，铁托的话虽然说得也非常动听，但是，他却始终不敢指明美国是侵略者，不敢站在被侵略者一边来谴责侵略者，结果只是重弹美国主子的论调。
    评论指出，陷在现代修正主义泥潭中，而又把头钻进美国的绞索里的铁托集团，已经彻底背叛了南斯拉夫人民的革命传统，他自己害怕斗争，还想阻止别人进行反美斗争。
    评论最后说，约翰逊—铁托杂技班子骗人的“和平”鬼把戏，只能越演越遭到天下人的唾骂。
    新华社墨尔本九日电　九日出版的《先锋报》指出，美国将在今年年底把它在越南的军队增加到四十万人，并且要求它的“盟国”提供更多的援助，但是同时，它却在继续谈论和平与谈判的问题。
    报纸说：“很清楚，美国谈论和平，是彻头彻尾的骗局。”
    《先锋报》强调指出，如果美帝国主义没有苏联修正主义者的实际支持，它早已被迫滚出越南了。
    《先锋报》说：“但是，苏联修正主义者在鼓励它。他们甚至威胁要对美帝国主义的头号敌人——中国——进行侵略。”
    报纸指出，现在澳大利亚已经被缚在美国的战车上，在这个时候，澳大利亚人民唯一的道路，就是发展最广泛的统一战线，反对美帝国主义及其傀儡，其中包括卡尔韦尔之流和阿隆斯修正主义集团；在苏联修正主义者企图破坏反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线的时候，这个修正主义集团企图破坏澳大利亚统一战线的发展。《先锋报》说，但是，他们的一切图谋都将遭到失败。“那些现在装作反对美帝国主义，但是实际上却在为美帝国主义效劳的人很快就会遭到彻底的揭露。他们现在已日益遭到揭露。”
