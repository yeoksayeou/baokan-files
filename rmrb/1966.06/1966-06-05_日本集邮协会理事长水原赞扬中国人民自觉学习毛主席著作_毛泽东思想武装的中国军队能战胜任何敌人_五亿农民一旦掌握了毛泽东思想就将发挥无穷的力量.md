    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd. Mizuhara Akimasa, Chairman of the Japanese Philatelic Association, said to Chinese reporters on the 2nd that the Chinese people's conscious study of Chairman Mao's works has become a widespread practice, and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, are invincible.
    Mizuhara recently visited China for the seventh time during the 1966 Spring China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou.
    Mizuhara said that the most profound impression he gained in China was that the Chinese people's conscious study of Chairman Mao's works has become a widespread practice and a habit in people's daily lives. He said that when he first entered the Chinese border town of Shenzhen to have a meal at a restaurant, he saw the restaurant staff using their spare time to study the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Later, he went to the newly built Aiqun Hotel on the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou and saw the staff there also actively studying Chairman Mao's works at any time. Moreover, in the park, on the sidewalks along the Pearl River, he saw people enthusiastically reading the Selected Works of Mao Zedong everywhere. He said that all of this greatly moved and impressed him.
    Mizuhara said that an important content of Mao Zedong Thought is to serve the people, and it is a thought that can truly bring happiness to the people. He said that today the Chinese people, through their practice, demonstrate in all aspects the noble style of "not for oneself, but dedicated to others" and "all work for the revolution."
    Mizuhara refuted the erroneous argument that everyone studying Mao Zedong Thought would make people's thinking "uniform." He said that this precisely proves that they have never read Mao Zedong's works and do not understand what Mao Zedong Thought is at all.
    Mizuhara said that the reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army is so powerful is that it is a people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that defends the interests of the people and serves the people. He said that such an army with a high level of ideological consciousness has defeated enemies at home and abroad in the past, and will be able to defeat any enemy holding superior weapons in the future. He said that the Chinese people love peace, but they dare to resolutely struggle against imperialism.
    During his visit to China, Mizuhara also visited a people's commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou. He said that he saw that Chinese peasants have embarked on the road of communization, which proves that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is correct and that Chinese peasants are willing to follow the Chinese Communist Party. He said that once 500 million Chinese peasants grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will unleash infinite and irresistible power.

    日本集邮协会理事长水原赞扬中国人民自觉学习毛主席著作
    毛泽东思想武装的中国军队能战胜任何敌人
    五亿农民一旦掌握了毛泽东思想就将发挥无穷的力量
    新华社东京三日电　日本集邮协会理事长水原明窗二日对中国记者发表谈话指出，中国人民自觉地学习毛主席著作已经蔚然成风，用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器武装起来的中国人民是所向无敌的。
    水原最近到广州参加一九六六年春季中国出口商品交易会期间，第七次访问了中国。
    水原说，他在中国获得的最深刻的印象是，中国人民自觉地学习毛主席著作已经蔚然成风，并且成为人们的日常生活习惯。他说，当他刚刚进入中国边境城镇——深圳到餐厅用饭时，看到餐厅的服务人员正利用空隙时间在学习毛泽东选集。后来他到了广州珠江畔新建的爱群饭店，看到那里的服务人员也随时随地利用空隙时间积极地学习毛主席的著作。而且，他在公园里，在珠江畔的人行道旁，到处看到人们在热心地阅读毛泽东选集。他说，这一切都使他大为感动和敬佩。
    水原说，毛泽东思想的一个重要内容就是为人民服务，它是真正能够给人民带来幸福的思想。他说，今天中国人民通过他们的实践在各方面都表现出“不为己，专为人”，“一切工作为革命”的高尚风格。
    水原驳斥那种认为人人学习毛泽东思想就会使人的思想“划一”的错误论调。他说，这恰恰证明他们根本没有读过毛泽东著作、也根本不懂得什么是毛泽东思想。
    水原说，中国人民解放军所以十分强大，就是因为它是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队，是一支保卫人民利益、为人民服务的军队。他说，这样一支有着高度思想水平的军队过去打败过国内外敌人，今后也能够战胜任何手持优势武器的敌人。他说，中国人民是热爱和平的，但是他们对帝国主义是敢于坚决斗争的。
    水原在中国访问期间，还参观了广州市郊区的一个人民公社。他说，他看到中国农民已经走上了公社化道路，这证明中国共产党的领导是正确的，中国农民是愿意跟着中国共产党走的。他说，五亿中国农民一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就将发挥无穷的不可抗拒的力量。
