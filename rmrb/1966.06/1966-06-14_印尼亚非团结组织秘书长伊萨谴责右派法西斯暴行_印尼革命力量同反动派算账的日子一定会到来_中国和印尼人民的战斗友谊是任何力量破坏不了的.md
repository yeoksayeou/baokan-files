    Xinhua News Agency, June 13th. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, received a letter on June 6th from Ibrahim Issa, Secretary of the Indonesian delegation to the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and Secretary-General of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization. In the letter, Issa, on behalf of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, strongly condemned the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, headed by Nasution and Suharto, for their fascist atrocities in massacring Communists and patriotic democrats on a large scale in Indonesia, while frantically opposing and ostracizing the Chinese, and undermining the traditional fraternal relations between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples, and expressed the Indonesian people's concern and support for the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia.
    The open letter pointed out, "The Nasution-Suharto fascist military regime and their supporters can never escape the responsibility for massacring and persecuting Overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and for massacring and persecuting Indonesian patriots and revolutionaries. They must repay the blood debt they owe."
    The open letter stated, "The Indonesian revolutionary forces, tested and tempered in struggle, are reorganizing themselves and continuing the struggle according to the conditions of the changed environment. The day will surely come when the Indonesian revolutionary forces, together with the people, settle accounts with the Indonesian reactionaries headed by Nasution and Suharto."
    The open letter said that under the command of Nasution and Suharto, the right-wing forces in Indonesia massacred no fewer than 300,000 Indonesian Communists and patriotic democrats, and imprisoned hundreds of thousands of people. At the same time, they launched a frenzied and brutal anti-Chinese movement. The right-wing forces attacked and persecuted Overseas Chinese in Indonesia, burned and looted their property, seized everything they owned, occupied their houses and organizations, and forcibly closed and occupied all universities and schools of Overseas Chinese, thus rendering tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese students unable to attend school and teachers unemployed. Their anti-Chinese terror activities "exceeded those of the fascists during World War II." The open letter said that in order to completely sever diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique trampled on the most basic provisions of international law, using bandits, ruffians, thugs, and even agents of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to attack, rob, and burn down the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta and Chinese consulates in many cities, attacking their personnel and diplomats, and insulting the leaders of the Chinese people and the country. They even shot a staff member of the Chinese Embassy, seriously wounding him.
    The open letter stated that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces "regard China, the most militant country in the anti-imperialist struggle and the bastion of the worldwide movement against the imperialist control, war, and aggression policies headed by U.S. imperialism, as their number one enemy. On the other hand, U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world and the root of war and aggression, has become their master, and they rely on the United States and faithfully follow the instructions of the Americans."
      "The current anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese racist movement carried out by the Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique is part of the worldwide anti-China movement of reactionary parties and their accomplices in accordance with the new global strategy of the United States to 'contain China.'"
    The open letter said, "For generations, Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have lived in friendship and harmony with our people. They have made good contributions to the welfare of our country and our people. They participated in the armed struggle and shed blood in the national independence war against Britain and the Netherlands in 1945-1948. The flesh-and-blood friendship between the Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia is deeply rooted. Therefore, the anti-Chinese movement of the Indonesian reactionaries and fascists led by Nasution and Suharto will never succeed. They will never succeed in undermining the militant, traditional unity and friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples. Their conspiracies, as well as the conspiracies of all reactionary parties and U.S. imperialism and their accomplices, are bound to fail! No force in the world can undermine the militant friendship and unity between China and Indonesia.
    The open letter concluded by expressing heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their solidarity and support for the Indonesian people. The open letter said, "At the most difficult moment for our people, your people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, once again demonstrated your strong, sincere, and militant solidarity and support. The Indonesian people will never forget this!"

    印尼亚非团结组织秘书长伊萨谴责右派法西斯暴行
    印尼革命力量同反动派算账的日子一定会到来
    中国和印尼人民的战斗友谊是任何力量破坏不了的
    新华社十三日讯　中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志收到了印度尼西亚驻亚非人民团结组织常设书记处书记、印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织秘书长伊卜拉欣·伊萨六日的来信。伊萨在信中代表印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织强烈谴责以纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的印度尼西亚右派反动势力，在印度尼西亚大规模屠杀共产党人和爱国民主人士的同时，疯狂地反华、排华，破坏印度尼西亚人民同中国人民之间的传统兄弟关系的法西斯暴行，并且表达印度尼西亚人民对在印度尼西亚的华侨的关怀和声援。
    公开信指出，“纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事政权和他们的支持者永远不能逃脱屠杀和迫害在印度尼西亚的华侨、屠杀和迫害印度尼西亚的爱国者和革命者的责任。他们必须偿还他们所欠下的血债。”
    公开信说：“在斗争中经受过考验和锻炼的印度尼西亚革命力量正在重新组织起来，根据改变了的环境的条件继续斗争。印度尼西亚革命力量和人民一道同以纳苏蒂安—苏哈托为首的印度尼西亚反动派算账的日子一定会到来。”
    公开信说，在纳苏蒂安和苏哈托指挥下的印度尼西亚右派势力，屠杀了不下三十万印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国民主人士，监禁了几十万人。与此同时，他们又发动了一个疯狂的、残暴的反对华侨和反华的运动。右派势力袭击和迫害在印尼的华侨，烧毁和掠夺他们的财物，抢走他们所有的东西，占领他们的房子和组织，强行关闭并占领华侨的所有大学和学校，因而使成千上万的华侨学生不能上学，教师陷于失业。他们所进行的反华、排华恐怖活动，“超过了第二次世界大战时的法西斯分子。”公开信说，为了使两国外交关系完全断绝，纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团践踏最基本的国际法规定，利用土匪、流氓、暴徒，甚至蒋介石集团的特务，一次又一次地袭击、抢劫和焚毁雅加达的中国大使馆和许多城市的中国领事馆，袭击他们的人员和外交官，侮辱中国人民和国家的领导人。他们甚至开枪射击一位中国大使馆的工作人员，使他身受重伤。
    公开信说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力“把中国这个在反帝斗争中最富有战斗性的国家、这个反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义控制、战争与侵略政策的世界性运动的堡垒，当作他们的头号敌人。另一方面，美帝国主义这个世界人民的头号敌人、战争和侵略的根源，却成了他们的主子，他们依赖美国，并忠实地照美国人的指示办事。”
      “纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团目前所进行的反华和排华种族主义运动是各国反动派及其帮凶按照美国‘遏制中国’的新的全球战略的世界性反华运动的一部分。”
    公开信说，“多少代以来，在印度尼西亚的华侨曾经同我国人民友好和睦地相处。他们对我国和我国人民的福利作出了很好的贡献。他们在一九四五——一九四八年反对英国和荷兰的民族独立战争中曾经参加武装斗争并流过血。印度尼西亚人民和在印度尼西亚的华侨之间的血肉友谊是根深蒂固的。因此，在纳苏蒂安与苏哈托领导下的印度尼西亚反动派与法西斯分子的反华、排华运动是永远不会得逞的。他们破坏印度尼西亚和中国人民之间的战斗的、传统的团结与友谊是永远不会得逞的。他们的阴谋以及所有反动派和美帝国主义及其帮凶的阴谋一定要失败！世界上没有任何力量可以破坏中国和印度尼西亚的战斗友谊和团结。
    公开信最后表示衷心感谢中国人民给予印度尼西亚人民的声援和支持。公开信说，“在我国人民最困难的时刻，你们的人民在毛泽东主席的英明领导下，再一次表现了你们的强烈的、真挚的和战斗的声援和支持。印度尼西亚人民对此将永远铭记不忘！”
