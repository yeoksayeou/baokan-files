    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th - The Japanese Sato government fabricated rumors and slandered the legitimate activities of the resident journalists from the Chinese *People's Daily* and *China Youth Daily* in Japan, who were covering news about the Japanese people's opposition to the US nuclear submarine's entry into Yokosuka. The two Chinese journalists held a press conference on the afternoon of the 5th and issued a statement refuting the Sato government's rumors. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    During the cabinet meeting on June 3rd, Nagayama Tadanori, the Japanese government's Minister of Autonomy (and Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission), gave a report on the "security situation" regarding the US nuclear submarine's entry into Yokosuka. He fabricated out of thin air that we had "participated" in the demonstrations held by the Japanese people to protest the entry of the US nuclear submarine, and had "shouted slogans such as 'Nuclear Submarines Get Out'" along with the marchers. Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato also pretended to take the matter seriously, saying it was a "major issue" and "instructed the relevant government authorities to investigate." Not only that, but the Japanese authorities also repeatedly publicized this rumor through newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and so on, to provoke.
    We solemnly declare: We have never engaged in any activities that go beyond news coverage. The above statement by the Japanese government is a completely unfounded fabrication and malicious slander, and we express our utmost indignation and regret at this.
    All our journalistic activities in Japan, including this coverage of the Japanese people's struggle against the entry of US nuclear submarines into Yokosuka, are the legitimate rights of ordinary journalists, are taken for granted, and are fully in line with the memorandum of the talks between the Liao Chengzhi Office and the Takasaki Office on the exchange of journalists between China and Japan on April 19, 1964. On the contrary, the Japanese authorities are constantly obstructing the journalistic activities of the People's Republic of China's resident journalists in Japan.
    This time, the words and deeds of the Japanese authorities are obviously an attempt to interfere with, obstruct, and undermine the legitimate journalistic activities of Chinese resident journalists in Japan. At the same time, it also exposes that some people are trying their best to please the United States and attempting to further worsen Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese government, which first provoked this incident, must bear full responsibility for this development.
    The exchange of journalists between China and Japan is in line with the common aspirations of the people and journalistic circles of the two countries. The resident journalists of the People's Republic of China in Japan have always carried out their interviewing and reporting work in the spirit of promoting friendship between the people of China and Japan and deepening the mutual understanding of the people of the two countries, and will continue to work hard for this in the future. Any attempt to obstruct or interfere with the legitimate business activities of Chinese resident journalists in Japan, to undermine the friendship between the people of China and Japan, or to worsen relations between the two countries is not permissible.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th - According to a report on the 5th by the Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, *Akahata*, Japanese Communist Party member of the House of Representatives, Taniguchi Zentaro, met with the Japanese government's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hashimoto Tomisaburo, on the morning of the 4th to protest against the Japanese government's slander of Chinese journalists and other issues.
    Taniguchi pointed out that the Minister of the National Public Safety Commission, Nagayama Tadanori, said at the cabinet meeting on the 3rd, "Two Chinese resident journalists in Japan participated in the demonstration against the US nuclear submarine held in Yokosuka on the 1st and shouted slogans along with the demonstrators. Moreover, the Japanese Communist Party recorded the demonstration and contacted the Chinese Communist Party via international telephone." This is a blatant fabrication without any basis. This exposes the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party's policy of hostility towards China, and it is also a conspiracy to sow discord between the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people.
    In response to Taniguchi's protest, Hashimoto evaded responsibility, saying: "This is all based on Nagayama's report. The statement about the recording must also be asked of the Minister of the National Public Safety Commission, Nagayama." Subsequently, Taniguchi lodged a protest with Nagayama. Nagayama initially said: "There is evidence, and the evidence has been sent to the Ministry of Justice." Under Taniguchi's questioning, Nagayama changed his tune and said: "The report was received from the local area, and a report was made to the cabinet meeting." He could not produce any concrete facts.
    Taniguchi once again lodged a strong protest, saying: "The government has made an unfounded fabrication, which is obviously a malicious conspiracy against the Japanese Communist Party and an unreasonable slander against Chinese resident journalists in Japan. The Minister of the National Public Safety Commission bears a major responsibility for this."
    According to a report in the Japanese *Yomiuri Shimbun* on the 4th, the Japanese Socialist Party, based on its investigation, "denied the claim that the two Chinese journalists participated in the demonstration and other actions, and believes that treating this issue as a matter for cabinet discussion seems to have a political motive."
    The Japan-China Friendship Association also issued a statement on the 4th protesting against the Japanese government's unwarranted provocation against Chinese resident journalists in Japan. The statement pointed out that the movement of the broad masses of the Japanese people against the entry of US nuclear submarines into Yokosuka is expanding daily, and it is only natural for Chinese resident journalists in Japan to go to the local area to cover news. The statement said: We have long known that the (Japanese) government, under the pretext of "protecting" Chinese journalists, is restricting and hindering their journalistic activities.
    The statement pointed out that the Japanese government is actively assisting the United States in expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and is further pursuing a policy of hostility towards China. The Japanese government is conducting anti-China propaganda everywhere and desperately creating an anti-China atmosphere among the people. This time, (the Japanese government) fabricated a non-existent incident and unreasonably provoked the Chinese journalists. We cannot help but believe that this is a blatant conspiracy to carry out anti-China propaganda in an attempt to further restrict the journalistic activities of Chinese journalists.
    The statement strongly protested against the Japanese government's words and deeds that violate the interests of the Japanese people, and demanded that the Japanese government correct its erroneous remarks and apologize to the Chinese journalists.

    我两名驻日记者发表声明驳斥日本当局造谣
    谴责佐藤政府破坏中日人民友谊
    日本各界强烈抗议佐藤政府无理寻衅煽动反华气氛
    新华社东京六日电　日本佐藤政府就中国《人民日报》和《中国青年报》驻日记者采访日本人民反对美国核潜艇进驻横须贺的新闻的正当活动，进行造谣诬蔑。这两名中国记者五日下午举行记者招待会，发表声明，驳斥佐藤政府的造谣。声明全文如下：
    日本政府的自治大臣（兼国家公安委员会委员长）永山忠则在六月三日的大臣会议上，作关于美国核潜艇进驻横须贺的“警备状况”报告时，竟无中生有地诬蔑我们“参加”了日本人民举行的抗议美国核潜艇进驻的示威，并且和游行队伍一起“呼喊‘核潜艇滚出去’的口号”。日本首相佐藤荣作也煞有介事地说什么这是一个“重大问题”，“指示政府有关当局予以调查”。不仅如此，日本当局还把这个谣言一再通过报纸、电台、电视台等，加以公布，进行挑衅。
    我们郑重声明：我们从来没有进行过超越采访新闻的任何活动。日本政府上述发言是完全没有事实根据的造谣和恶意中伤，我们对此表示极大的愤慨和遗憾。
    我们在日本的一切采访活动，包括这一次采访日本人民反对美国核潜艇进驻横须贺的斗争在内，是一般新闻记者的正当权利，是理所当然的，是完全符合一九六四年四月十九日廖承志办事处和高碕办事处关于中日双方交换新闻记者的会谈纪要的。相反地，日本当局对中华人民共和国驻日记者的采访活动不断进行妨害。
    这次日本当局的言行，显然是企图干涉、阻挠和破坏中国驻日记者的正当的采访活动，同时也暴露了有些人是在竭力讨好美国，企图进一步恶化中日关系。对于这一事态的发展，首先挑起这一事件的日本政府必须承担全部责任。
    中日双方交换记者，是符合中日两国人民和两国新闻界的共同愿望的。中华人民共和国驻日记者一向是本着促进中日两国人民的友好和加深两国人民的相互了解的精神，进行采访和报道工作的，今后将继续为此而努力。任何阻挠、干涉中国驻日记者正当业务活动的权利、破坏中日两国人民友谊、恶化两国关系的企图，都是不能容许的。
    新华社东京六日电　据日本共产党中央机关报《赤旗报》五日报道，日本共产党众议员谷口善太郎四日上午会见了日本政府官房长官（秘书长）桥本登美三郎，就日本政府诬蔑中国记者等问题，提出了抗议。
    谷口指出，国家公安委员长永山忠则在三日的大臣会议上说，“两名中国驻日记者参加了一日在横须贺举行的反对美国核潜艇的示威，并同示威队伍一起喊了口号。而且，日本共产党把这次示威录了音，用国际电话同中国共产党进行了联系。”这是没有任何根据的明显的捏造。这暴露了日本政府和自由民主党的敌视中国的政策，这也是企图挑拨离间日本共产党和日本人民的阴谋。
    对于谷口提出的抗议，桥本推诿责任说：“这都是根据永山的报告，关于录音的说法，也得问国家公安委员长永山。”接着，谷口向永山提出了抗议。永山最初说：“有证据，证据已经送给了法务省。”在谷口追问下，永山改口说：“是接到了当地的报告，向大臣会议作了报告。”他拿不出半点具体的事实来。
    谷口再次提出强烈抗议说：“政府发表了毫无根据的捏造，很明显是对日本共产党的恶毒的阴谋，是对中国驻日记者的无理诬蔑。国家公安委员长对此是负有重大责任的。”
    据日本《读卖新闻》四日报道，日本社会党根据调查，“否定了中国两名记者参加示威等行动的说法，并且认为，把这个问题当作大臣会议讨论的问题，似乎是有政治企图的。”
    日本中国友好协会也在四日发表声明，抗议日本政府对中国驻日记者的无端寻衅。声明指出，广大日本人民反对美国核潜艇进驻横须贺的运动日益扩大，中国驻日记者到当地采访新闻是理所当然的。声明说：我们早已知道（日本）政府以“保护”中国记者为口实，限制和妨碍他们的采访活动。
    声明指出，日本政府正在积极协助美国扩大侵略越南战争，并且进一步推行敌视中国的政策。日本政府正在到处进行反华宣传，拚命在国民中间制造反华气氛。这次，（日本政府）又制造了一个莫须有的事件，向中国记者无理寻衅，我们不能不认为，这是一个明显的进行反华宣传的阴谋，企图进一步限制中国记者的采访活动。
    声明严重抗议日本政府的这种违反日本国民利益的言行，并且要求日本政府更正自己的错误言论，并向中国记者赔礼道歉。
