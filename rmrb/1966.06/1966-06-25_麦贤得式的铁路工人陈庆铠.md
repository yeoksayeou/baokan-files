    Chen Qingkai, a railway worker in the style of Mai Xiande
    Chen Qingkai's heroic deeds of fearing no sacrifice for the revolution and stopping a train with his severed hand are being spread among the railway workers of Guangxi.
    Chen Qingkai's heroic deeds once again demonstrate that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, and have the highest ideological realm and the most tenacious revolutionary will.
    Fearless in the Face of Danger for the Revolution
    The incident occurred on the morning of February 15th this year.
    At 5:05 a.m., before dawn, in the drizzling rain, Chen Qingkai arrived at the Shigutang Station on a freight train. As soon as the train stopped, he took the signal lamp and ran to contact the station. The deputy stationmaster asked him to wait until a train had passed and then help with the shunting operation.
    About half an hour later, after the first train had passed, Chen Qingkai began the shunting operation. He led the locomotive to the freight line, coupled to the car, and then pulled it to a siding in the station and uncoupled it. As soon as he lifted the coupling hook, he discovered that the freight car was moving automatically. Chen Qingkai immediately realized that the track ahead was a long and steep downhill slope, and passenger train No. 253 was about to pass; if the car rolled down, it would cause a serious collision. He immediately commanded himself: I must stop it.
    At this critical moment, Chen Qingkai hurriedly climbed onto the car to tighten the hand brake in order to stop the car. He tightened it once, but it didn't brake; he tightened it again, but the car didn't stop. At this point, he discovered that the hand brake was malfunctioning. The car was rolling faster and faster, only three hundred meters away from the station's switch. He immediately got off the car and picked up ballast to put under the wheels, but it was ineffective even after several attempts. Seeing that a serious accident was about to happen, what to do? Then, he remembered what his master had once said, that using clothes to pad the wheels could stop the car. So, without hesitation, he took off his clothes and immediately twisted them into a ball to stuff under the wheels. He stuffed it once, and the wheel ran over it; he stuffed it again, and it ran over it again. He picked up the clothes for the third time, but couldn't pick them up even after two attempts. He felt a burst of numbness in his right hand. Using the light from the locomotive headlight, he raised his hand and saw that his right palm was crushed!
    His palm was crushed, did he fall down? No! "To die for the people is heavier than Mount Tai!" Chairman Mao's words gave him the greatest encouragement and strength. His face didn't change color, his heart didn't panic, his eyes fixed on the still-rolling car, and he had only one thought in his mind: resolutely stop it!
    Enduring the sharp pain, he immediately picked up the clothes with his left hand and ran forward, catching up with the car, and stuffed the clothes under the wheels again. He ran ten meters, twenty meters, one hundred meters... He stuffed it five times in a row, and the speed of the car slowed down, but the distance to the station's signal box was getting closer and closer. While stopping the car, he shouted, "Switchman, quickly get the wheel chock!" The switchman heard the call and came to stop the car with the wheel chock. An accident was avoided. Chen Qingkai dedicated his right hand for the revolution and for the people.
    Chen Qingkai, supporting his injured right hand, returned to the station's operations room. Despite the continuous bleeding, he was still thinking about his work. Knowing that he could no longer take this train, he said to the comrades at the station, "The freight bill for the car I coupled is still in my pants pocket, please help me take it out, otherwise the car won't be able to leave for Litang Station without the freight bill." He also said, "My signal lamp is still on the platform, please help me bring it back."
    Steel-like Will
    Chen Qingkai was sent to Yulin Railway Hospital. During the more than a month of treatment, he showed the unyielding spirit of the proletariat everywhere.
    In the operating room, he didn't even hum once. The surgeon asked him with concern:
  "How do you feel? Does it hurt?"
    Chen Qingkai replied calmly, "It doesn't hurt."
    The nurse unwrapped the bandage on Chen Qingkai's hand, which was covered in blood, and saw that all five fingers were crushed and half of his palm was gone. The ten fingers are connected to the heart, why didn't he cry out in pain? What a strong person!
    Chen Qingkai was thinking about the Party, Chairman Mao, the country's socialist construction, and how to better work for the revolutionary cause in the future. He endured the pain with a strong will and cooperated with the doctors with the greatest perseverance in order to heal his severed hand as soon as possible and return to work for the revolution. Whenever the doctors and nurses asked him if it hurt, he always answered loudly, "It's okay, it doesn't hurt!"
    On the third day after the operation, Chen Qingkai was very weak, but he lay in bed and began to study Chairman Mao's work "Serve the People." He read it again and again, thought about it again and again, and studied until after eleven o'clock in the night. How much he wanted to pour out his heart to the Party! That night, he didn't sleep well. The next day, he borrowed a pencil from the nurse, found a piece of wood, placed it on his lap, and opened his diary to practice writing with his left hand, to report his thoughts to the Party. It was very difficult to write with his left hand, but it couldn't stop the proletariat's revolutionary hero! After practice, he finally wrote down his insights from studying Chairman Mao's works with his left hand. He wrote in his notes: "When I think of the lives and property of the people and the country, I would not hesitate to sacrifice my own life, so what does it matter to lose a hand!" "After studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood the principle that individual interests must be subordinate to collective interests and national interests. The heroic images of Zhang Side, Bethune, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Xu Xuehui, and others prevented me from falling down after my fingers were crushed."
    After the operation, in order to prevent Chen Qingkai's wound from becoming inflamed and deteriorating, the doctors gave him eight injections every day for thirteen consecutive days, and countless needle holes covered Chen Qingkai's buttocks, so that he could only sleep on his side. His pain was clearly visible to his comrades, and every small movement he made required great perseverance. Every time his dressing was changed, beads of sweat would appear on his face, and every time the nurse gave him an injection, his teeth could be heard clenching, but he didn't say a word. He wrote in his notes: "They ask me if it hurts, if I feel uncomfortable, I feel infinite warmth! In front of these loved ones, can I say it hurts, so that they worry about me and affect their work? Of course not."
    He read Chairman Mao's works again and again, carefully examining his attitude and will towards difficulties.
    A red heart sincerely for the people comes from the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought gave Chen Qingkai unlimited strength. He was always thinking about how to work for the Party. The railway line in front of the hospital constantly echoed with the rhythmic sound of train wheels speeding by. Sometimes he would run to the gate, silently counting the trains, one, two, three... He thought: Now the transportation is so busy, I'm staying in the hospital, my comrades have taken on my work, increasing their workload, I must work harder after I am discharged from the hospital.
    Growing up under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought
    Chen Qingkai was born into a peasant family. Under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, he understood the principles of revolution and understood that today's happy life did not come easily. After graduating from university in 1963, he was assigned to work at the Yulin Crew Resident Station on the Lizhan Line. As soon as he stepped into his job, the Party branch was very concerned about his growth, often educating him: "Intellectuals must combine with workers to transform their thinking. To be a good conductor for the people, you must study Chairman Mao's works hard and establish a proletarian world view."
    These words were not truly understood by Chen Qingkai, who had just left school. At first, he thought that since he graduated from the Railway Institute, there would not be much difficulty in doing his job. Once, he and a chief conductor were running a train. According to regulations, the chief conductor had to fill out the report form. Chen Qingkai thought he was a college student, so what was so profound about filling out a report form? So he took it over to help fill it out. Who knew that when the chief conductor looked at it after he filled it out, it was wrong. The chief conductor educated him, but he thought it was a technical problem. The ideological problem was not resolved. After returning, he read "Serve the People." When he read the sentence, "If we have shortcomings, we are not afraid of others criticizing and pointing them out," he felt particularly touched. He examined his own thinking, mainly that he had not put down the airs of intellectuals, nor had he truly established the idea of serving the people. So, he earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as his regular course, determined to learn and apply at the same time, learning a little and using a little, paying attention to tempering and transforming himself in practical work. Chen Qingkai started with the little things in his daily work, taking the old workers as examples in everything, working regardless of what was his job, doing whatever he could do, and humbly learning from others when he didn't understand.
    Once, he was directing the departure of a train at Wenli Station, and gave the signal for a long time, but the driver didn't whistle and start the train. He felt strange. Someone told him, "The signal you're giving isn't accurate." He accepted this opinion, and after getting on the train, he picked up the signal lamp and practiced facing the car panel for a long time. The next day, when he returned to Yulin, it was already after eleven o'clock at night, and he picked up the signal lamp and kept practicing. Others persuaded him to rest, but he said, "For the sake of the train being on time, I have to practice even if I'm tired." With the help and influence of the old workers, he realized that if he didn't give signals properly, it would cause the train to be late, affecting the entire line's operating order; if he gave the wrong signal, causing a train that shouldn't be leaving to depart, it would cause serious damage to the lives and property of the people. Giving a signal seems like a small thing, but if it's not done well, it will affect the major affairs of the people. He began to feel that his responsibility was great. He connected his work with the interests of the country and the people. He realized how important and glorious it is to be a screw in socialist construction!
    Through repeatedly studying articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chen Qingkai understood a most fundamental principle: serving the people means not talking about conditions, and talking about conditions is not wholeheartedly serving the people. He often saw that old workers treated their work, no matter how big or small, always so seriously and meticulously, tirelessly, without complaints or grumbles. Comparing himself to them, he was not as good as the old workers in many ways. He felt that it was not enough to just understand the principles and talk about them, but they must be implemented in his own thoughts and actions. So, he set higher demands on himself, earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works, and doing whatever Chairman Mao said. Every time he ran a train, regardless of wind or rain, regardless of cold winter or hot summer, regardless of day or night, regardless of whether anyone was supervising, he checked the vehicles with a high sense of responsibility to the people, never being careless. Chen Qingkai often said: You must work consciously and actively, and you cannot be half-hearted in revolution.
    After Chen Qingkai realized that his ideological transformation was an arduous task, he took the initiative to find arduous work to train himself. Last October, Chen Qingkai was running a train on the Hemao Line. Seeing that others were working the night shift was more difficult, he thought that this was a good opportunity to train himself, so he took the initiative to ask the team leader to change his day shift to a night shift. After Chen Qingkai worked several night shifts in a row, he began to feel tired, and his enthusiasm for work also declined. He thought, why are those comrades who work the night shift year after year so enthusiastic? With this question, he once again studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility in his work and his extreme warm-heartedness towards all comrades and the people." At this time, Chen Qingkai realized that those comrades whose enthusiasm for work was always full first thought not of themselves, but were extremely responsible for their work. What he lacked was precisely the word "extreme." He continued to study deeply with this question, and his thinking improved another step. Chen Qingkai not only strictly demanded himself in his work, but also strictly demanded himself in his life, making sure to leave the difficulties to himself and the convenience to others.
    Now Chen Qingkai has been discharged from the hospital. After this struggle with his disability, his will is even stronger. He said: "I must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, be a good worker of Chairman Mao, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Now, although my right hand is disabled, I still have a left hand, and a heart that will never be disabled. I will use my left hand to continue fighting and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction."

    麦贤得式的铁路工人陈庆铠
    陈庆铠为革命不怕牺牲、断手堵车的英雄事迹，正在广西铁路广大职工中传颂着。
    陈庆铠的英雄事迹再一次表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，是思想境界最高、革命意志最顽强的人。
    为革命临危不惧
    事情发生在今年二月十五日早晨。
    五点零五分时，天色未亮，细雨纷飞，陈庆铠乘一趟货物列车到达了石鼓塘车站。车一停下，他就提着信号灯，跑去车站联系。车站的副站长要他等交会一趟车以后，帮忙担任调车作业。
    大约过了半个小时，交会了第一趟车以后，陈庆铠开始了调车作业。他领着机车去货物线路挂好这个车辆，再拉到车站的一股道甩下来。车停妥，他刚一提开车钩，就发现这辆装着货物的车辆在自动溜动。陈庆铠立即意识到：前面线路是又长又陡的下坡道，二五三次旅客列车将要开过来了，要是车一溜下去，那将造成撞车的严重后果。他立刻命令自己：一定要堵住它。
    就在这紧急的时候，陈庆铠赶忙爬上车去拧手制动闸，以便把车刹住。他一拧，刹不住；再拧，车不停。这时他发现，手制动闸失灵了。车越溜越快，距离出站的道岔只有三百米了。他立即下车，拣起石碴往车轮底下垫，但是垫了几次也无效。眼看一场严重事故就要发生，怎么办？这时，他想起师傅曾经说过，用衣服垫车轮可以刹住车。于是，他毫不犹豫地脱下衣服，并且马上拧成一团往车轮下堵。一堵，车轮压过去了；再堵，又压过去了。他第三次用手去拾衣服，一连拾了两次，衣服都拿不起来，只觉得右手一阵麻木。他借着车头灯射来的光，抬手一看：右手掌压断了！
    手掌压断了，倒下去了吗？不！“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”！毛主席的话，给了他最大的鼓舞和力量。他脸不变色，心不乱，眼盯着还在溜动的车辆，心里只有一个念头：坚决堵住它！
    他忍住剧痛，立即用左手拣起衣服往前跑，赶上了那车辆，又把衣服往车下堵。他跑了十米，二十米，一百米……。他连续堵了五次，车辆溜动的速度有所减低，可是距离车站的扳道房越来越近了。他一边堵车，一边呼唤：“扳道员，快拿止轮器！”扳道员闻声赶来，拿止轮器把车止住了。一场事故避免了。陈庆铠为革命、为人民献出了自己的右手。
    陈庆铠托着受伤的右手回到车站运转室。尽管流血不止，他想的仍然还是工作。他知道自己已经不能再乘这趟列车，就对车站的同志说：“挂的这个车的货票，还在我裤兜里，请帮我掏出来，不然这个车到黎塘车站没有货票挂不走。”又说：“我的信号灯还在站台上，请你帮我拿回来。”
    钢铁般的意志
    陈庆铠被送进了玉林铁路医院。在一个多月的治疗过程中，他处处都显示了无产阶级的硬骨头精神。
    在手术室里，他连哼都没有哼一声。外科医生关切地问他：
  “你感觉怎么样？痛吗？”
    陈庆铠不动声色地回答：“不痛。”
    护士解开陈庆铠手上沾满了血迹的纱布，仔细一看，原来五个手指都压断了，半个手掌没有了。十指连心，他为什么不喊痛呢？多么坚强的人！
    陈庆铠想的是党，是毛主席，是祖国社会主义建设事业，是今后如何更好地为革命事业而工作。他用坚强的意志忍着疼痛，用最大的毅力，同医生合作着，以便早日治好断手，早日出院为革命而工作。每当医生、护士问他痛不痛的时候，他总是响亮地回答：“没事，不痛！”
    陈庆铠在动手术后的第三天，身体很虚弱，但他躺在病床上，又开始学习毛主席著作《为人民服务》。他读了又读，想了又想，一直学到深夜十一点多。心里有多少话要向党倾诉呀！这晚，他一夜没有睡好。第二天，他向护士借来一支铅笔，找了块木板，摆在膝上，翻开日记本，用左手练习写日记，要把自己的思想向党汇报。左手提笔很困难，但是难不住无产阶级的革命英雄！经过锻炼，他终于用左手写下了学习毛主席著作的心得。他在笔记里写道：“我想到人民、国家的生命财产，就是牺牲个人生命，也在所不惜，何在乎失去一只手！”“经过毛主席著作的学习，使我懂得了个人利益要服从集体利益、国家利益这个道理。张思德、白求恩、王杰、麦贤得、徐学惠等英雄形象，使我在压断手指后不致倒下去。”
    动手术后，医生们为了使陈庆铠的伤口不至发炎恶化，一连十三天，天天给他打八针，一个个针孔布满了陈庆铠的臀部，使他只能侧着身子睡。他的痛苦，同志们看得清清楚楚，他每一个微小的动作，都要付出极大的毅力。每当给他换药的时候，他脸上都冒出点点汗珠，每当护士给他打针时，就听到他的牙齿咬得咯咯响，但却不吭一声。他在笔记中写道：“问我痛不痛，有那些不舒服，我感到无限的温暖！在这些亲人面前，我能说痛，使他们为我担忧而影响工作吗？当然不能。”
    他一次又一次地阅读着毛主席著作，认真地检查着自己对待困难的态度和意志。
    一颗赤诚为人民的红心，是来自活学活用毛主席著作。毛泽东思想使陈庆铠产生了无限的力量。他时刻想着如何为党工作。医院前面的铁路线，不时传来列车飞驰时的有节奏的车轮声。他有时就跑到大门口，默默地数着列车，一列，两列，三列……他想：现在运输这么忙，我住在医院里，同志们担负了我的工作，增加了工作量，我出院后要加倍努力工作才对。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长
    陈庆铠出身在一个农民家庭。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，使他懂得了革命的道理，懂得了今天幸福生活来之不易。一九六三年他大学毕业后，被分配到黎湛线上的玉林乘务驻在所工作。他一踏上工作岗位，党支部就很关怀他的成长，经常教育他：“知识分子要和工人结合才能改造好思想。要做一个人民的好车长，就必须努力学习毛主席著作，树立无产阶级世界观。”
    这些话，对于初出校门的陈庆铠，没有真正懂得。起初，他认为自己是铁道学院毕业的，干本项的工作，是不会有多大困难的。有一次，他和一位正车长跑车。按规定，正车长要填写报单，陈庆铠认为自己是大学生，填个报单有什么深奥？就拿过来帮填了。谁知填好后给正车长一看，却填错了。正车长对他进行了教育，但他认为这是技术问题。思想问题没有解决，回来后，他翻阅了《为人民服务》。当他读到：“我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”这句话时，感到特别亲切。他检查自己的思想，主要是没有放下知识分子的臭架子，也没有真正树立为人民服务的思想。于是，他认真读毛主席的书，特别是把“老三篇”作为自己常读的课程，决心边学边用，学一点用一点，注意在实际工作中锻炼改造自己。陈庆铠就从日常的工作中，一点一滴做起，处处以老工人为榜样，工作不分份内份外，只要自己能做就做，不懂就虚心向别人学习。
    有一次，他在文里站指挥发车，打了好久信号，不见司机拉笛开车。他觉得奇怪。别人告诉他：“打的信号不准确。”他接受了这个意见，上车后拿起信号灯，对着车板一直练了好久。第二天回到玉林已是晚上十一点多钟了，他又拿起信号灯不断地练习。别人劝他休息，他说：“为了列车正点，再累也要练。”在老工人的帮助和影响下，他认识到，如果自己打信号做得不到家，就会造成列车晚点，影响全线路的运行秩序；如果打错了信号，使不应开的车开出去了，就会造成人民生命财产的严重损失。打个信号，看来是个小事，但打不好，就会影响到人民群众的大事。他开始觉得自己的责任重大。他把自己的工作同国家人民的利益联系在一起了。他认识到，做一个社会主义建设中的螺丝钉是多么重要而又光荣啊！
    陈庆铠通过多次学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，懂得了一条最根本的道理：为人民服务就是要不讲条件，讲条件就不是全心全意为人民服务。他常看到老工人对待工作，不管大事小事，总是那么认真细致，不厌其烦，无怨言也无怪话。他对照自己，有许多方面不如老工人。他感到，只懂得道理，口头上说说还不行，必须落实到自己的思想和行动上。于是，他对自己提出了更高的要求，认真学习毛主席著作，做到毛主席怎么说的就怎么做。每次跑车，不管刮风下雨，不管寒冬炎夏，不管白天黑夜，不管有没有人监督，他都本着对人民高度负责的精神，检查车辆从不马虎。陈庆铠常说：干工作就要自觉主动，干革命不能掺半点假。
    当陈庆铠认识到自己的思想改造是一件艰巨的工作以后，就主动自觉地找艰苦的工作来锻炼自己。去年十月，陈庆铠在河茂线上跑车，看到别人值夜班比较辛苦，他想，这正是锻炼自己的好机会，便主动找组长要求把自己的日班换成夜班。当陈庆铠一连值了几个夜班以后，自己开始感到困倦，工作劲头也有所下降时，他想，那些长年累月值夜班的同志，他们的劲头为什么那么足呢？他带着这个问题，又一次地学习了《纪念白求恩》。毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”这时，陈庆铠才明白，那些工作劲头始终十足的同志，他们首先想到的不是自己，而是对工作极端负责。自己所缺乏的正是“极端”两个字。他带着这个问题继续深入学习，思想又提高了一步。陈庆铠不仅在工作中严格要求自己，在生活上对自己也处处严格要求，做到了把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。
    现在陈庆铠已经出院了。经过这次和伤残斗争，他的意志更坚强了。他说：“我一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，做毛主席的好工人，全心全意为人民服务。现在我的右手虽然残废了，但是，我还有一只左手，还有一颗永不残废的心。我要用我的左手继续战斗，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出更大的贡献。”
