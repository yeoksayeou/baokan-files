    Overthrow the Enemy Without Guns
    《Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles》lavishes praise on the reactionary military officers captured by our army, depicting them as "heroes" with both courage and strategy, always taking the initiative. They commit evil deeds, and their reactionary arrogance is extremely blatant. We must ask: did our army capture the enemy, or did the enemy "capture" us?
    As for the depiction of Yang Ziming, the enemy's section chief, it is even more extremely vile. He was captured and disguised himself as an ordinary soldier, but our army did not expose him; he pretended to chase a horse for our army's medic (note: this horse ran alongside the troops, and our army's medic shouted "Catch it!" from behind, but no one in our army paid attention, and this prisoner was the one who chased after it), and he easily rode away on the horse. Yang Ziming could come and go as he pleased. In order to contact their captured division commander for collaboration, he easily infiltrated our troops again. Look, how clever and capable this enemy section chief is, and how confused and foolish our army is. Doesn't the director's boosting of the enemy's morale, diminishing our army's prestige, and trampling on our army, praising the enemy, show that the director and the Kuomintang reactionaries are of one mind and wear the same pants?
    Chairman Mao told us: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns; they will inevitably engage in a desperate struggle with us, and we must never underestimate these enemies." The director of the film 《Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles》is this kind of enemy without guns. You use film to attack us, and we will never spare you!

### 打倒不拿枪的敌人

    打倒不拿枪的敌人
    《逆风千里》对于被我军俘虏的反动军官，极尽美化之能事，把他们描写成有勇有谋，处处居于主动地位的“英雄”。他们为非作歹，反动气焰十分嚣张。我们要问：是我军俘虏了敌人呢，还是敌人“俘虏”了我们？
    至于对敌军处长杨子鸣的描写，更是极端恶劣。他被俘了，化装成一个普通士兵，我军没有把他揪出来；他装作替我军卫生员追马（注意：这匹马在部队身边跑，我军卫生员在后边大呼“抓住它”，我军战士却无人理睬，而要这个俘虏出来追），而让他轻轻松松骑上马跑掉了。杨子鸣真是想走就走，想来就来。为了和他们被俘的师长联系，以便里应外合，他又轻易地混进我们部队来。看看，这个敌处长何等精明强干，而我军又是何等糊涂愚蠢。编导者这样长敌人志气，灭我军的威风，这样糟蹋我军，颂扬敌人，不是说明了编导者和国民党反动派是一个鼻孔出气，和他们穿的是一条裤子吗？
    毛主席告诉我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”影片《逆风千里》的编导者就是这种不拿枪的敌人。你们利用电影向我们进攻，我们决不会饶过你们！
