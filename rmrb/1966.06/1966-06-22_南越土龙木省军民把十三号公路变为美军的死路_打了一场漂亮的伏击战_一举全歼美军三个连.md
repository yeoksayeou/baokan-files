    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th – According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Thu Dau Mot Province, South Vietnam, annihilated three U.S. infantry companies in a beautiful ambush battle on Highway 13 on June 11. Additionally, from June 4 to 13, the army and people of this province continuously and fiercely attacked and intercepted the enemy on Highway 13, eliminating over 700 enemy troops, including over 300 U.S. aggressors. They completely annihilated two U.S. armored battalions and three puppet army companies, and destroyed and shot down 35 enemy aircraft. Furthermore, the Liberation Army heavily damaged two other U.S. companies.

    According to reports, in the battle where the Liberation Army attacked a U.S. armored convoy and the puppet army stronghold in Tran Thanh town in the Can Lam bridge area on June 8 alone, after more than two hours of fighting, they killed and wounded over 500 enemy troops, including over 300 U.S. aggressors. A number of wounded U.S. soldiers were killed by enemy aircraft after Liberation Army medical personnel had bandaged them. The Liberation Army completely annihilated two U.S. armored battalions and three puppet army companies, possessing 43 tanks and armored vehicles and 9 other military vehicles, and shot down 8 enemy aircraft.

    The South Vietnamese *Liberation Army Daily* recently published a commentary, warmly praising the new victories achieved by the South Vietnam Liberation Army on Highway 13 in Thu Dau Mot Province.

    The commentary said that Highway 13 is a strategic highway for the enemy. They use this highway to transport thousands of troops every day to "sweep" everywhere, attempting to divide the vast liberated areas of the southern eastern region from east to west. To ensure the passage of Highway 13, the enemy constantly bombs and spreads chemical poisons along both sides of the highway, turning these areas into no-man's lands. However, the army and people of the southern eastern region resolutely contain the enemy on Highway 13, vigorously destroying bridges and highways, setting up obstacles, burying landmines, digging stake pits and traps on the highway, paralyzing the enemy's military transportation and isolating the enemy's various military districts.

    The commentary said that if Highway 13 used to be the road of "blood and tears" for the puppet army's 5th Division, now it is the death road for the U.S. 1st Infantry Division.

    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 20th – According to reports, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces attacked a U.S. Marine Corps artillery position near Chu Lai and the Shui Fu puppet army county headquarters near the outskirts of Hue City on the morning of the 20th.

    According to Western news agencies, shortly after midnight, the Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce bombardment of a U.S. Marine Corps artillery position about 15 kilometers northwest of Chu Lai. Liberation Army soldiers broke through the enemy's wire defenses and engaged in close combat with the U.S. aggressors, killing and wounding some of them.

    According to reports, around 2:00 AM on the same day, another Liberation Armed Force attacked the Shui Fu puppet army county headquarters less than two kilometers from the center of Hue City. Preliminary reports say that the Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded over ten enemy soldiers, destroyed part of the county headquarters' buildings and warehouses, and captured a batch of weapons and the county headquarters' radio.

    南越土龙木省军民把十三号公路变为美军的死路
    打了一场漂亮的伏击战　一举全歼美军三个连
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道，越南南方土龙木省军民，六月十一日在第十三号公路上进行的一场漂亮的伏击战中，一举全歼美军三个步兵连。另外，这个省的军民从六月四日到十三日，接连在第十三号公路上猛烈袭击和截击敌人，共歼敌七百多名，其中包括美国侵略军三百多名，全歼美军两个装甲营和伪军三个连，击毁和击落敌机三十五架。此外，解放军还重创另外两连美军。
    据报道，仅在六月八日解放军在芹林桥地区袭击美军装甲车队和真诚镇伪军据点的战斗中，经过两个多小时的战斗，就打死打伤敌人五百多名，其中包括美国侵略军三百多名。另有一批被打伤的美军，在解放军的医务人员为他们进行包扎后，被敌机炸死。解放军一举全歼拥有坦克、装甲车四十三辆和其它军车九辆的美军两个装甲营和伪军三个连，击落敌机八架。
    越南南方《解放军报》最近发表评论，热烈赞扬越南南方解放军在土龙木省第十三号公路上取得的新战果。
    评论说，第十三号公路是敌人的战略公路。它们每天通过这条公路运送数以千计的军队到处“扫荡”，企图分割南部东区从东到西的广大解放区。为了保证第十三号公路的通行，敌人不断地对公路沿线两旁进行轰炸和撒放化学毒药，把这些地方变成无人地带。但是南部东区军民坚决把敌人箝制在第十三号公路上，大力破坏桥梁和公路，在公路上设障碍物、埋地雷、挖桩板坑和陷阱等，使敌人的军事运输处于瘫痪状态，使敌人的各个军事支区陷于孤立。
    评论说，如果说第十三号公路过去是伪军第五师的“血和泪”的路，那么现在它又是美国第一步兵师的死路。
    新华社二十日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十日晨进攻了朱莱附近的美国海军陆战队炮兵阵地和顺化市近郊的水富伪军县总部。
    据西方通讯社透露，解放武装力量在午夜后不久，向朱莱西北约十五公里的美国海军陆战队炮兵阵地发动猛烈炮轰，解放军战士突破敌人设有铁丝网的防御工事，和美国侵略军展开近战，杀死杀伤一些敌人。
    据报道，当天清晨二时左右，另一支解放武装力量攻进了离顺化市中心不到两公里的水富伪军县总部。初步消息说，解放武装力量打死打伤敌军十余名，炸毁县总部的一部分建筑物和仓库，并缴获一批武器和县总部的无线电。
