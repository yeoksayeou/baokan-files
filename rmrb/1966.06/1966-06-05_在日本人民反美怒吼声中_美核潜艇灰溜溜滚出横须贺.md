    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Tokyo: Amidst the resounding cries of the Japanese people: "US nuclear submarines get out!" and "US nuclear submarines are never allowed to enter again!", the US nuclear submarine "Sergeant Fish," which intruded into Yokosuka Port, sailed out of the Japanese port on the morning of the 3rd.
    On the morning of the 3rd, about two thousand workers, students, and citizens held a meeting in a park in Yokosuka City. Attendees passed a declaration amidst thunderous applause, calling for uniting people from a broad range of backgrounds to launch a more powerful struggle.
    Since May 29, Yokosuka has held eight mass rallies, with a total participation of over 110,000 people. As of June 2, 60% of Yokosuka's 320,000 residents had signed petitions opposing the entry of US nuclear submarines into the port.
    Mizuno Tadashi, chairman of the Yokosuka branch of the All Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union, said that during the intrusion of the US nuclear submarine "Sergeant Fish" into the port, Japanese workers employed at the US Naval Base in Yokosuka refused all work related to nuclear submarines.
    The struggle of the people of Yokosuka has received strong support from the people of other parts of Japan. A youth representative sent by 200 workers from Kyoto Prefecture said, "Yokosuka City does not look like a Japanese city. I am determined to double my efforts to fight for the true independence of Japan."
    A young worker working in a public utility agency in Yokohama said that the entry of US nuclear submarines into Japan and the Sato government's actions in following the US have rapidly raised the political awareness of our workers.
    Hirota Naomichi, chairman of the Kanagawa Prefecture Peace Committee, said: "Because the US government sent nuclear submarines to Yokosuka, the reactionary face of US imperialism and the Sato government, which cooperates with it, has been exposed to more and more Japanese people."
    In Tokyo, about 17,000 people held a demonstration rally on the 2nd. The meeting was hosted by the Central Executive Committee for Abolishing the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and Realizing Various Demands. Konno Yojiro, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He condemned US imperialism, which is in crisis due to its defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam, for sending nuclear fleets to Japanese ports with the cooperation of the Sato government, attempting to drag Japan into the quagmire of the war of aggression. Hori Makoto, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, and Hirozawa Ken, a representative of the Socialist Party, also spoke at the meeting, calling on the Japanese people to continue the struggle and resolutely oppose the intrusion of US nuclear submarines into Japan.
    After the meeting, participants braved the heavy rain and marched in high spirits through the downtown streets of Tokyo. As the demonstrators passed the US Embassy in Japan, which was heavily guarded by Japanese police, they raised their clenched fists and angrily shouted slogans such as "US aggressors get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Asia! Get out of Japan!"

    在日本人民反美怒吼声中
    美核潜艇灰溜溜滚出横须贺
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：在日本人民发出的“美国核潜艇滚回去！”、“永远不准美国核潜艇开进来！”的响亮的呼声中，闯入横须贺港的美国核潜艇“军曹鱼号”，三日早晨驶离日本港口。
    三日清晨，约两千工人、学生和市民在横须贺市的一个公园举行集会，到会者在雷鸣般的鼓掌声中通过了团结广泛阶层人民，展开更加强大的斗争的宣言。
    从五月二十九日以来，横须贺举行了八次群众集会，参加的人数共达十一万以上。到六月二日为止，横须贺三十二万居民中，就有百分之六十的人签名反对美国核潜艇闯入这个港口。
    全日本驻军工会横须贺分会委员长水野忠说，在美国核潜艇“军曹鱼号”闯进这个港口期间，受雇在横须贺美国海军基地工作的日本工人，拒绝了一切与核潜艇有关的工作。
    横须贺人民的斗争得到了日本其他地方人民的有力声援。京都府两百个工人派来的一个青年代表说：“横须贺市不象是日本的城市。我决心要为日本的真正独立而加倍努力斗争。”
    一个在横滨公共事业机关工作的青年工人说，美国核潜艇开进日本和佐藤政府追随美国的行为迅速提高了我们工人的政治觉悟。
    神奈川县和平委员会会长广田直道说：“由于美国政府把核潜艇派到横须贺，美帝国主义和同它合作的佐藤政府的反动面目被越来越多的日本人民识破了。”
    在东京，二日约有一万七千人举行了示威大会。大会是由废除日美“安全条约”和实现各种要求中央执行委员会主持的。日共中央政治局候补委员绀野与次郎在会上讲了话。他谴责在侵越战争中遭到失败而陷入危机的美帝国主义，在佐藤政府的合作下派遣核舰队开进日本的港口，企图把日本拖入侵略战争的泥坑中。中央执行委员会事务局长堀真琴和社会党代表广泽贤也在会上讲了话，他们呼吁日本人民继续斗争，坚决反对美国核潜艇闯入日本。
    会议结束后，与会者冒着倾盆大雨斗志昂扬地在东京闹市街上举行示威游行。示威者在经过由日本警察层层警卫的美国驻日本大使馆时，高举紧握的拳头怒呼：“美国侵略者从越南南方滚出去！从亚洲滚出去！从日本滚出去！”等口号。
