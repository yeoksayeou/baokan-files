Yan'an is the holy land of the Chinese revolution and also a place that the revolutionary people of the whole world yearn for. The ten years that Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China spent here were ten years of brilliant victories for Mao Zedong Thought. As the international prestige of the great Communist Party of China has reached unprecedented heights and as the great Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of people around the world, more and more foreign friends are coming to Yan'an to study Mao Zedong Thought. In 1962, there were 60 people from 10 countries, and in 1965, this number increased to 1,200 people from 63 countries. In the first five months of this year, more than 700 foreign friends from over 50 countries across five continents have visited Yan'an. Many foreign friends, as soon as they set foot on Chinese soil, eagerly requested to visit Yan'an. They said, "Yan'an is where Chairman Mao lived and fought for a long time. Coming to China without visiting Yan'an would be a lifelong regret." After arriving in Yan'an, they personally saw the glorious achievements and arduous journey of Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people from victory to victory, and they had a deeper understanding of the greatness of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their heartfelt admiration for Chairman Mao and their boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought with sincere and enthusiastic language.

Chairman Mao is the great teacher and banner of the world's revolutionary people

Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to achieve great victories in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation in Yan'an. Foreign friends have a strong longing for Yan'an, and they believe that "Yan'an is the holy land of the Chinese people's revolution, and it is also the holy land of the world's revolution." Many people, upon arriving in Yan'an, rushed to Fenghuang Mountain, Zao Garden, Yangjialing, and Wangjiaping with great enthusiasm to visit the places where Chairman Mao once lived. In Yan'an, they saw with their own eyes the cave dwellings where Chairman Mao lived, the wooden beds he slept on, the earthenware he used, and learned about how the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao, overcame the Japanese imperialists and the reactionary Kuomintang in extremely harsh conditions. All of this made foreign friends deeply admire the wisdom, greatness, and correctness of Chairman Mao. A friend from a trade union delegation from Ceylon wrote neatly in the guestbook after visiting the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall: "Mao Zedong is the living Lenin." An American friend, Lee Dunbai, after visiting Yan'an, praised Chairman Mao Zedong as "the great leader of the Chinese people, the great leader of the American working class and laboring people, and the great leader, teacher, and banner of the world's revolutionary people."

Chairman Mao once said in Yan'an that the cave dwellings in Yan'an are the most revolutionary, and that there is Marxism-Leninism in the cave dwellings of Yan'an. The people of the whole country place their hopes in the Communist Party of China and in the cave dwellings of Yan'an. Now, when foreign friends come to Yan'an in person and hear the Chinese hosts introduce these words that Chairman Mao said back then, they feel even more intimate and have an even deeper love and admiration for Chairman Mao. Many revolutionary friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America said excitedly: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in the Yan'an cave dwellings will shine upon the whole world," "Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people, the savior of the Asian people, and the helmsman of the world's people," "Chairman Mao is the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism in contemporary times," "Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guide for the Chinese people's revolution but also the guide for the revolutions of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples, and the guide for the world's revolutionary people," "Mao Zedong Thought is the sun of victory for the revolutionary people of all countries in the world." Many foreign friends, when visiting Chairman Mao's residence, said: "It is the greatest happiness to stand in the cave dwelling where Chairman Mao lived." They stayed for a long time, unwilling to leave, and took photos or drew pictures of the cave dwelling where Chairman Mao lived to keep as the most precious mementos.

The works of Chairman Mao are the sharp weapons of the world's revolution

The great theoretical works that Chairman Mao produced during his time in Yan'an left a deep impression and great encouragement on foreign friends. The hosts introduced to foreign friends that out of the 158 articles in the first four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," 93 were written by Chairman Mao in Yan'an. A Chilean friend, after hearing this, praised: "Chairman Mao, in Yan'an, did great theoretical work for the revolutionary cause of mankind, and this great achievement resonated throughout Latin America." Members of the Vietnamese Women's Delegation repeatedly praised Chairman Mao Zedong as "the greatest genius of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, who creatively developed Marxism-Leninism theory." The chairman of the Japanese Propaganda and Reporting Joint Struggle Conference Delegation, Kase Kazuhiro, said: "Especially 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction,' are works that correctly inherit and greatly develop Marxism-Leninism philosophy." He visited the first cave dwelling where Chairman Mao lived on Fenghuang Mountain after arriving in Yan'an in January 1937. Upon entering the cave dwelling, he saw that apart from a square table, a round chair, a wooden bed, and a brazier, there was almost no other furniture, and he gave a thumbs up, saying: "Chairman Mao is truly great!" A young friend from Bolivia, after visiting the small kerosene lamp that Chairman Mao used, said meaningfully: "The kerosene lamp is small, but it shines light upon the world." Some foreign friends said: "Chairman Mao's articles are published in a timely manner and are extremely enlightened," "Chairman Mao's articles written in Yan'an are a great contribution to the world." A French friend said that Chairman Mao's works "not only guide the Chinese revolution to victory but are also the sharp weapons for the revolutionary people of the whole world to engage in revolutionary struggles." Many foreign friends copied down Chairman Mao's quotations while visiting.

Chairman Mao grasps the laws of historical development

In 1946, the reactionary Kuomintang, relying on its 4.3 million reactionary army equipped by American imperialism, launched a full-scale attack on our liberated areas. At that time, our People's Liberation Army had only 1.2 million people. In such a situation where the enemy was strong and we were weak, Chairman Mao received the American journalist Anna Louise Strong and put forward the brilliant proposition that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." Every time foreign friends from various countries visited the place where Chairman Mao met this American journalist, they showed great interest and had an even deeper understanding of the immense greatness of the famous saying "all reactionaries are paper tigers." A Japanese friend, Tokunaga Nenjo, said: "Before coming to Yan'an, I was thinking about a question: Why could Chairman Mao, in such harsh conditions, have an optimistic outlook for the future. After coming to Yan'an and visiting Yangjialing, I understood that this was because Chairman Mao grasped the laws of historical development and gained the trust of the people." Eight comrades from Vietnam wrote in the guestbook: "Chairman Mao's brilliant proposition that 'all reactionaries are paper tigers' not only strengthened the confidence of the Chinese people in defeating the reactionary Kuomintang at that time but is now also a powerful weapon for the people of the world to oppose American imperialism, oppose modern revisionism, and oppose the reactionaries of various countries." They also said that Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of despising the enemy strategically and taking the enemy seriously tactically has great guiding significance for the anti-American national salvation struggle that the Vietnamese people are currently waging. We must learn Chairman Mao's military thoughts better and accelerate the victory of our country's anti-American national salvation struggle.

The small rice and rifles displayed in the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall particularly attracted the attention of friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Some said: "Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to defeat the Japanese imperialists who had modern weapons with the equipment of 'small rice and rifles,' which shows that Chairman Mao's proposition that the decisive factor in the victory or defeat of a war is people, not things, is completely correct." Some said: "I didn't understand what 'small rice and rifles' meant before, but after coming to Yan'an, I understood it vividly, which is the determination of the Chinese people to defeat the enemy." After visiting, they requested to eat Yan'an's small rice and expressed that after returning to their country, they would follow Chairman Mao's words to oppose armed counter-revolutionaries with armed revolution.

The self-reliant spirit of Chairman Mao is the treasure of the world's people

In the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the reactionary Kuomintang imposed military and economic blockades on the liberated areas, causing great difficulties in the economy of the liberated areas. To smash the enemy's plots, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "rely on our own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing and food." The military and people of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, tilled the land themselves, spun and wove cloth, made paper, and made shoes and socks, launching a magnificent production movement. In a few years, they achieved self-sufficiency in clothing and food. The old hoes and other labor tools used by the revolutionaries of Yan'an at that time are now displayed in the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall. Many foreign friends, after seeing these exhibits, sighed and said that the battle cry of self-reliance and hard struggle proposed by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China has great power and far-reaching significance. They copied down Chairman Mao's personal calligraphy "rely on our own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing and food" from the exhibition hall or took photos of it. At the Yan'an Reception Hall, they enthusiastically watched the historical revolutionary documentary "Nanluwan." This film records how more than 20 years ago, the 359th Brigade and the direct-subordinate artillery regiment of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "rely on our own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing and food," entered Nanluwan, cleared the undergrowth, tilled the land, and achieved self-sufficiency in production, turning the desolate Nanluwan into a "good southern land in northern Shaanxi." A Japanese friend said: "After watching the film 'Nanluwan,' I thought: The Chinese people have such a spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and they can achieve anything." A young friend from Angola believed that Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to achieve brilliant victories under such harsh conditions by relying on their own strength, which is truly inspiring and a model for the people of the world. Two friends from Latin America left a message: "The spirit of self-reliance cultivated by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao is the greatest treasure of the Chinese people and also the greatest treasure of the oppressed people of the world." Two friends from Basutoland said with confidence that they believe the policy of self-reliance is a policy that all fighters against imperialism and old and new colonialism should follow.

The greatness of Chairman Mao lies in his service to the world proletariat

Foreign friends were deeply moved by Chairman Mao's simple and frugal lifestyle and his close connection with the masses during their visit to Yan'an. Many foreign friends, after seeing the land where Chairman Mao once farmed in Yangjialing, showed a sense of boundless admiration and requested to participate in labor there. An old Lao friend said: "Chairman Mao participating in labor and farming is a manifestation of the noble demeanor of a proletarian leader." A friend from an Asian country, after seeing a photo of Chairman Mao wearing patched cotton pants and giving a speech to the officers of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army, said: "I like this photo the most." After obtaining this photo, he excitedly said: "I will keep it forever. Chairman Mao's simple and frugal style will give me boundless strength." Many foreign friends, after hearing the moving story of how Chairman Mao gave New Year's greetings to the people, had heart-to-heart talks with farmers, and helped the villagers make production plans in Zao Garden, were so moved that they shed tears of joy and repeatedly praised "Chairman Mao is truly the great leader of the people, Chairman Mao loves the people, and the people love Chairman Mao," "With Chairman Mao, not only is it the happiness of the Chinese people, but also the happiness of the people of the world." A Japanese friend said that in the past, he doubted whether there were politicians in the world who had no selfish motives, but now he found the answer in Yan'an. He said: Chairman Mao is precisely a politician with no selfish motives. Chairman Mao's mind is thinking about the liberation of all the people of China and the liberation of all the people of the world. A Chilean friend said excitedly: "The first lesson in Yan'an is that I truly understood the inseparable relationship between revolutionary leaders and revolutionary masses. The greatness of Chairman Mao lies here, in that he has a heart that is dedicated to China and to the world proletariat."

Mao Zedong Thought is a truth that is universally applicable

The fact that the people of Yan'an follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying forward revolutionary traditions and striving for greater glory" and build the revolutionary holy land more magnificently made foreign friends further realize that the great Mao Zedong Thought is not only the strongest weapon to defeat class enemies but also the most effective weapon to conquer nature.

Yan'an is located in the hilly and gully area of the Loess Plateau, and in the past, soil erosion was very serious. The people of Yan'an, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried out large-scale afforestation, terraced field construction, and other activities centered on water and soil conservation, greatly changing the appearance of Yan'an. A French friend originally thought that changing the natural landscape was unimaginable and believed that people could only be at the mercy of nature. In Yan'an, he saw that the local people had built a large number of terraced fields on hill after hill, and he drew another conclusion: "Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will form a huge material force. The people of Yan'an are indeed the people educated by Mao Zedong." The Political Bureau member and Minister of Justice of the Malian Sudanese Union Party, Mamadou Madeira Keita, stood on the top of a hill behind Fenghuang Mountain, pointing to the layer upon layer of terraced fields in front of him, and said: "Such a grand project can only be accomplished in a country that is making revolution and building socialism under the leadership of Chairman Mao." The deputy secretary-general of the Japanese Song Association, Saito Ryosuke, said: "I have seen with my own eyes that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have indeed built China into a socialist country. I feel that Mao Zedong Thought is a truth that is universally applicable."

Let Mao Zedong Thought bloom and bear fruit all over the world

Many foreign friends, after visiting Yan'an, loved Chairman Mao even more and had even greater faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works and to take Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an back to their own countries to make Mao Zedong Thought bloom and bear fruit all over the world. A Brazilian friend, as soon as he arrived in Yan'an, said to the Chinese staff accompanying him: "In Yan'an, I will learn to the maximum and rest to the minimum, and I will thoroughly understand how Chairman Mao led the Chinese people in revolutionary struggles and what the revolutionary spirit of the people of Yan'an is. I will take everything I have learned back to Brazil and let the flowers of revolution bloom in Brazil." A Haitian friend, after visiting Yan'an, realized that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the truth of liberating and building China but also the truth of transforming the world. A Haitian friend said: "To make a revolution, one must follow the path of Mao Zedong and study Chairman Mao's works." A young friend from Laos said: "I will take Mao Zedong's works as my motto and act according to Chairman Mao's words." The chairman of the Japanese Asian-African Solidarity Committee delegation, Ito Jitsu, said: "We regard the great Mao Zedong Thought as the sun of the oppressed nations and peoples opposing imperialism." Several African friends, after visiting Yan'an, said: "In our country, the reactionary government discovers who has 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' and that person will be imprisoned, but we will still buy 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' in China and find ways to take it back." Comrades from Albania, who are at the forefront of opposing modern revisionism, said that no matter how the enemy carries out sabotage and blockade, they cannot stop Mao Zedong Thought and the Yan'an style from spreading among the people of the world, and they cannot stop the advance of the Chinese revolution, just as Chinese comrades often say, "It is difficult for an ant to shake a tree," and just as the people of Albania say, "Dust cannot push over a car," the enemy cannot stop Mao Zedong Thought. Vietnamese comrades said excitedly: "Mao Zedong Thought once illuminated Yan'an and China, and now it illuminates the whole world."

Many foreign friends, when leaving Yan'an, enthusiastically sang "The East Is Red" and shouted "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" to express their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao.

    毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的共同财富
    ——访问延安的外国朋友热烈颂扬伟大的毛泽东思想
    延安，是中国革命的圣地，也是全世界革命人民向往的地方。毛主席和中共中央在这里的十年，是毛泽东思想光辉胜利的十年。随着伟大的中国共产党的国际威望空前提高，随着伟大的毛泽东思想日益深入世界人心，前来延安学习毛泽东思想的外国朋友越来越多。一九六二年有十个国家的六十人，一九六五年增加到六十三个国家的一千二百多人。今年的头五个月，就有来自五大洲五十多个国家的七百多名外国朋友前来访问。许多外国朋友一踏上中国国土，就急切地要求到延安来参观。他们说，延安是毛主席当年长期居住过和战斗过的地方，来到中国，不到延安是毕生的遗憾。他们来到延安后，亲眼看到毛主席领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的光辉业绩和艰苦历程，更加深刻地体会到毛主席的伟大和毛泽东思想的伟大，他们用热情洋溢的真诚的语言，表达了世界革命人民对毛主席的衷心爱戴和对毛泽东思想的无限信仰。
    毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师和旗手
    毛主席在延安领导中国人民取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利和解放战争的伟大胜利。外国朋友非常向往延安，他们认为“延安是中国人民的革命圣地，是世界人民的革命圣地”。许多人一到延安，就满怀激情地赶到凤凰山麓、枣园、杨家岭和王家坪，参观这些毛主席曾经住过的地方。在延安，他们亲眼看到了毛主席住过的土窑洞，睡过的木板床、用过的土瓷器等，了解了以毛主席为首的中国共产党中央，在当时极端艰苦的条件下，在这里领导全中国人民战胜了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的经过。这一切，都使得外国朋友们对毛主席的英明、伟大、正确感到无限敬佩。锡兰一个工会代表团的朋友参观延安革命纪念馆后，在留言簿上工工整整地写道：“毛泽东是活着的列宁”。美国朋友李敦白到延安参观后，赞扬毛泽东主席“是中国人民的伟大领袖，是美国工人阶级和劳动人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖、导师和旗手。”
    毛主席当年在延安的时候曾经说过，延安的窑洞是最革命的，延安的窑洞里有马克思列宁主义，全国人民把希望寄托在中国共产党身上，也寄托在延安的土窑洞里。现在，当外国朋友们亲身来到延安，在这里听到陪同参观的中国主人向他们介绍毛主席当年说过的这些话时，他们都感觉到更加亲切，更增进了他们对毛主席的热爱和敬仰。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的许多革命朋友激动地说：“延安窑洞里的毛泽东思想光辉将普照全世界”，“毛主席是中国人民的领袖，亚洲人民的救星，世界人民的舵手”，“毛主席是当代反帝反修的旗手”，“毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民革命的指南，也是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民革命的指南，世界人民革命的指南”，“毛泽东思想是世界各国人民革命胜利的太阳”。不少外国朋友参观毛主席住处时，说：“能在毛主席住过的窑洞里站一站也是最大的幸福”。他们久久不愿离去，纷纷把毛主席住过的窑洞摄入镜头或画下来，留作最珍贵的纪念。
    毛主席著作是世界革命的锐利武器
    毛主席在延安期间进行的巨大的理论著述工作，给外国朋友以强烈的印象和极大的鼓舞。主人向外国朋友介绍：《毛泽东选集》一至四卷的一百五十八篇文章中，有九十三篇是毛主席在延安写的。一位智利朋友听后赞不绝口地说：“毛主席在延安为人类革命事业进行了艰巨伟大的理论著述工作，这丰功伟绩响彻了拉丁美洲。”越南妇女代表团的成员连声称颂毛泽东主席是“当代马克思列宁主义最伟大的天才，他创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义理论。”日本宣传报道共同斗争会议代表团团长加势和昭说：“特别是《实践论》和《矛盾论》，是正确地继承并大大地发展了马克思列宁主义哲学的著作。”他到凤凰山麓参观了毛主席一九三七年一月到延安后居住的第一个窑洞。走进窑洞，只见这里除去一张方桌、一把罗圈椅、一张木板床和一个烤火盆外，几乎再没有什么陈设，他竖起大拇指说：“毛主席真伟大！”玻利维亚一位青年朋友参观了毛主席用过的小煤油灯后，意味深长地说：“煤油灯虽小，但它向世界放射了光芒。”有的外国朋友说：“毛主席的文章发表得很及时，并且是极其英明的”，“毛泽东主席在延安所写的文章是对世界的巨大贡献”。法国的一位朋友说，毛主席著作“不仅指引中国革命走向胜利，也是全世界革命人民进行革命斗争的锐利武器。”不少外国朋友边参观边抄写毛主席语录。
    毛主席掌握了历史发展的规律
    一九四六年，国民党反动派凭借着它四百三十万由美帝国主义武装起来的反动军队，向我解放区发动了全面进攻。当时，我人民解放军只有一百二十万人。在这种敌大我小、敌强我弱的情况下，毛主席接见了美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗，提出了“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。每当各国朋友们参观毛主席当年接见这位美国记者的地方时，都表现了极大的兴趣，更加体会到“一切反动派都是纸老虎”这句名言的无比伟大。日本朋友德永年章说：“到延安前，我就考虑一个问题：毛主席在当时这样艰苦的条件下，为什么能对前途抱着乐观的预见。到了延安，参观了杨家岭，我了解到这是因为毛主席掌握了历史发展的规律，并且得到了人民的信任。”越南的八位同志在留言簿上写道：“毛主席提出的‘一切反动派都是纸老虎’的英明论断，不仅增强了当时中国人民战胜国民党反动派的斗争信心，而且现在对世界人民反对美帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派，也是强有力的斗争武器。”他们还说，毛主席在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人的战略思想，对越南人民正在进行着的抗美救国斗争很有指导意义。我们一定要更好地学习毛主席的军事思想，加速我国抗美救国斗争的胜利。
    延安革命纪念馆陈列着的小米和步枪，特别引起了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国朋友的注意。有的说：“毛主席领导中国人民用‘小米加步枪’的装备，打败了拥有现代化武器的日本帝国主义，这说明毛主席关于战争胜败的决定因素是人而不是物的论断，是完全正确的。”有的说：“过去我不了解‘小米加步枪’是什么意思，来延安才形象化地了解了，这就是中国人民战胜敌人的决心。”他们参观后，要求吃延安的小米，并表示回国后要按照毛主席的话，以武装的革命来反对武装的反革命。
    毛主席的自力更生思想是世界人民的财富
    在抗日战争最艰苦的年代，国民党反动派对解放区进行军事、经济封锁，使解放区的经济发生了很大的困难。为了粉碎敌人的阴谋，毛主席发出了“自己动手，丰衣足食”的伟大号召。陕甘宁边区军民热烈响应毛主席的号召，自己开荒，自己纺线织布、造纸、做鞋袜，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。几年工夫，就做到了丰衣足食。当年延安革命者用过的老镢头和其它一些劳动工具，现在都陈列在延安革命纪念馆里。许多外国朋友看见这些实物后感慨不已地说，毛主席和中国共产党提出的自力更生、艰苦奋斗的战斗口号，有着巨大的威力和深远的意义。他们纷纷把纪念馆里展出的毛主席的亲笔题字“自己动手，丰衣足食”抄下来，或摄入镜头。在延安招待所，他们兴致勃勃地观看了历史革命纪录片《南泥湾》。这部影片纪录了二十多年前八路军一二○师三五九旅和总部直属炮兵团，遵照毛主席“自己动手，丰衣足食”的指示，进驻南泥湾，披荆斩棘，开荒屯田，实现生产自给，使荒芜的南泥湾变成了“陕北好江南”的情景。一位日本朋友说：“看了《南泥湾》影片，我这样想：中国人民有了这样一种精神——自力更生、艰苦奋斗，什么事情都可以办到。”安哥拉一位青年朋友认为，毛主席领导中国人民，依靠自己的力量，“在这样艰苦的条件下取得了辉煌的胜利，真不容易，这对世界人民是一个鼓舞，是世界人民的榜样。”拉丁美洲两位朋友留言道：“自力更生这种由中国共产党和毛主席培养起来的革命精神，是中国人民的最大财富，也是世界上受压迫人民的最大财富。”巴苏陀兰两位朋友满怀信心地说，我们相信自力更生的方针，是所有反对帝国主义和反对新老殖民主义的战士都应该遵循的方针。
    毛主席的伟大在于他为世界无产阶级服务
    外国朋友在延安参观时，深深地为毛主席艰苦朴素和密切联系群众的作风所感动。许多外国朋友在杨家岭看到当年毛主席种过的地以后，不约而同地表现出一种无限钦佩的神情，要求在这块地里参加劳动。一位老挝青年朋友说：“毛主席参加劳动种地，这是无产阶级领导者表现出的高尚风度。”亚洲国家的一位朋友看到毛主席穿着带补钉的棉裤给八路军一二○师干部讲话的照片时说：“我最喜欢这张照片。”他在得到这张照片后兴奋地说：“我要永远保存它，毛主席艰苦朴素的作风，会给我增添无比的力量。”不少外国朋友听了当年枣园乡乡长杨成富介绍毛主席给群众拜年，同农民谈心，帮助乡亲们制订生产计划的动人事迹，感动得流下热泪，连声称赞“毛主席真是人民的伟大领袖，毛主席爱人民，人民爱毛主席”，“有了毛主席，不仅是中国人民的幸福，也是世界人民的幸福”。日本的一位朋友说，过去他对世界上有没有毫不利己之心的政治家是怀疑的，如今他在延安找到了答案。他说：毛主席正是毫不利己的政治家。毛主席脑子里想的是全中国人民的解放和全世界人民的解放。一位智利朋友激动地说：“来到延安的第一课，是使我真正懂得了革命领袖和革命群众之间鱼水不分的关系，毛主席的伟大就在这里，就在于他有一颗全心全意为中国、为全世界无产阶级服务的心。”
    毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理
    延安人民遵循毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，把革命圣地建设得更加雄伟壮丽的事实，使外国朋友进一步认识到：伟大的毛泽东思想，不仅是战胜阶级敌人的最强大的武器，也是征服自然的最有效的武器。
    延安地处黄土高原丘陵沟壑区，过去水土流失十分严重。延安人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大规模地开展了以水土保持为中心的植树造林、修造梯田活动，使延安的面貌发生了很大变化。一位法国朋友原来觉得改变自然面貌是不可思议的，认为人只得听从自然的摆布。在延安，他看到当地人民在一座座土山上修建了大量梯田，便得出了另一个结论：“毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会形成巨大的物质力量。延安人民不愧是毛泽东教育下的人民。”马里苏丹联盟党政治局委员、司法部长马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔站在凤凰山后的一座山顶上，指着眼前的层层梯田说：“这么浩大的工程，只有在毛主席领导下的搞革命、搞社会主义的国家才能做到。”日本歌声代表团副秘书长齐藤良三说：“我亲眼看见中国人民由于有了毛主席的领导，确确实实地把中国建设成了一个社会主义国家。我感到毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。”
    让毛泽东思想在全世界开花结果
    许多外国朋友访问延安后，更加热爱毛主席，更加信仰毛泽东思想，纷纷表示要努力学习毛主席著作，要把毛泽东思想和延安的革命精神带回本国去，让毛泽东思想在世界各地开花结果。一位巴西朋友一到延安，就对陪同他的中国人员说：“在延安，我要最大限度地学习，最小限度地休息，要好好了解毛主席是怎样领导中国人民进行革命斗争的，延安人民的革命精神是什么。我要把自己所学到的一切，带到巴西去，让革命之花，在巴西开放。”海地的朋友访问延安后认识到，毛泽东思想不仅是解放和建设中国的真理，也是改造世界的真理。一位海地朋友说：“要革命就要走毛泽东的道路，就要学习毛主席著作。”老挝一位青年朋友说：“我要把毛泽东的著作作为座右铭，按照毛主席的话办事。”日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团团长伊藤实说：“我们把伟大的毛泽东思想当作被压迫民族和人民反对帝国主义的太阳。”几位非洲朋友参观延安后说：“在我们国家里，反动政府发现谁有《毛泽东选集》，谁就要坐牢，可是我们还是要在中国买《毛泽东选集》，想办法带回去。”站在反对现代修正主义前列的阿尔巴尼亚同志说，不管敌人怎样进行破坏和封锁，都不能阻挡毛泽东思想和延安作风在世界人民中间传播，都不能阻止中国革命前进的步伐，正象中国同志常说的“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，也象阿尔巴尼亚人民说的“灰尘推不倒汽车”一样，敌人是挡不住毛泽东思想的。越南同志激动地说：“毛泽东思想过去照红了延安，照红了中国，现在照红了全世界。”
    很多外国朋友在离开延安时，还兴奋地唱起了《东方红》，高呼“伟大的毛主席万岁”、“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁”，来表达他们对毛主席无限爱戴的心情。
