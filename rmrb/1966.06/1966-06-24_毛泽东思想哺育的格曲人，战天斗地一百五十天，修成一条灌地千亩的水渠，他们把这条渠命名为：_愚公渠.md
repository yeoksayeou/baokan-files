    The Gequ people, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, relied on their own strength, and in one hundred and fifty days built a "Yugong Canal" that crossed cliffs, spanned ravines, was seven li long, and could irrigate more than one thousand mu of wasteland. At the same time, they also opened up 300 mu of new paddy fields, increasing the average arable land per commune member by two mu. The Gequ people accomplished a feat that their ancestors had dreamed of but could not achieve, becoming today's "New Yugong."
    1. Studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains": Inspiring Commune Members' Determination to Fight Heaven
    Gequ is a production brigade of the Kangyang Commune in Jianzha County, Qinghai Province, with a total of thirty-nine households and sixty laborers. The brigade is backed by Mount Guozang and faces the Yellow River. Every summer and autumn, the swollen Yellow River devours the fertile land here, leaving the entire brigade with an average of just over one mu of irrigated land per person.
    In order to divert water from the Gequ Gully to the Zhuangkou Beach and increase irrigated land, the brigade party branch organized all commune members and cadres to begin studying Chairman Mao's article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and the heroic deeds of Dazhai and Xiaogaoling immediately after the autumn harvest last year.
    Zhuangkou Beach is a dry plateau located east of Gequ. If the water from the Gequ Gully at its western end could be diverted there, nearly one thousand mu of irrigated land could be developed. In the old society, the Gequ people wanted to divert the water from the Gequ Gully to irrigate their fields, but they lacked manpower and resources, and the canal was never built. The Gequ people studied Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and established the ambition to fight heaven and earth. They said: With the banner of Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, there is no Mount Tai that cannot be overturned, and no sea of fire that cannot be crossed.
    On the first day of the tenth lunar month last year, the distant mountaintops were covered with white snow, and the banks of the Yellow River were lined with layers of ice. At this very moment, the Gequ Brigade put forward a plan to complete the canal within three years.
    2. Studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains": "King Yama's Whip" Became "Liberation Cliff"
    The first question encountered in building the canal was: Should they rely on the state or rely on their own efforts? At that time, some cadres and commune members said: Can such a large project be done without state funding? Under these circumstances, the party branch once again organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and Chairman Mao's articles on self-reliance. Through study, people's understanding improved, and they said: Once you get used to being spoon-fed, you will become increasingly greedy; if we rely on the state once, we will be unable to do without it next time. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and be self-reliant like Dazhai and Xiaogaoling.
    Chairman Mao's thought of self-reliance generated boundless wisdom and strength in the Gequ people. Lacking technology and instruments, the brigade cadres and five elderly men over fifty years old used their eyes to survey, used their shovels to measure, piled stones, and planted paper flags to make markings. After four revisions and checks, the route of the canal was finally determined. Lacking steel, cement, and modern tools, they took up their own iron shovels and pickaxes and borrowed twelve sledgehammers and eighteen steel drills from the county and started working.
    In the depths of winter, the ground was frozen solid, and the mountain wind cut through skin and bones. But the laughter of the canal builders and the clanging of pickaxes and shovels striking rocks and frozen earth made the Gequ Gully seethe with activity.
    The project progressed quickly, but when the canal reached "King Yama's Whip," a new problem arose. From the bottom of the gully, this cliff seemed to pierce the sky, covered with sharp red slate blocks. Could the canal pass along the middle of the cliff? Chairman Mao's writings gave them the enormous strength to subdue mountains and rivers. People stepped forward one by one, firmly stating: If Yugong could move mountains with his bare hands, we can remove "King Yama's Whip" with our bare hands! Zhi Nu Hai, the secretary of the brigade party branch, said to everyone decisively: "That's right! First, peel off the skin of 'King Yama's Whip,' then smash 'King Yama's Whip,' we must force 'King Yama's Whip' to bow its head!"
    Zhi Nu Hai took off his cotton coat, picked up a pickaxe, and plunged towards "King Yama's Whip." He first dug a place on the cliff where his feet could barely stand, climbed up one step, then dug another, and then climbed up another step, and so on until he climbed all the way up. His heroic actions deeply moved the other commune members. Then Han Yi Si Ha, Ma Zi Li Ha, Jiang Yi Si Ma and other poor and lower-middle peasant youth climbed up. Before long, several young female commune members also appeared on "King Yama's Whip." They used iron shovels and pickaxes to knock down the red slate blocks, and swung steel drills to drill blasting holes. For the first time, the heroic spirit of the Gequ people shook "King Yama's Whip."
    After several days of hard work, they finally blasted away half of the cliff of "King Yama's Whip" and built the canal here. The Gequ people cheered with pride on the canal, changing the name of "King Yama's Whip" to "Liberation Cliff."
    3. Studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains": Removing the Mountains in Thought
    But the struggle was only just beginning!
    When opening the canal in dangerous areas such as Gunniu Slope, Yingge Mouth, and QuickSand Slope, some landlords and rich peasants came out and said: "The places this canal has to pass through are all ghost gates, whoever gets close to it will suffer!" The party branch believed that in order for the project to proceed smoothly, it was necessary to first strike down the arrogance of the class enemies and continuously conduct class struggle and revolutionary spirit education among the masses. They said: If you want to remove the mountains of nature and change the face of the landscape with the revolutionary spirit, you must grasp class struggle firmly and first remove the mountains of old thoughts of fearing difficulties and fearing revolution in people's minds. Therefore, while taking safety measures, the party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," mobilized the masses to launch face-to-face reasoning struggles against class enemies who made destructive remarks, put a stop to the evil winds, and aroused the fighting spirit of the masses.
    Ma Husaini, an almost sixty-year-old poor peasant blacksmith, was moved by the fiery passion of his fellow villagers, also led his son Da Wu, took his blacksmithing tools, and set up a furnace on the construction site. Father and son were dedicated to making steel drills and forging pickaxes, striving to contribute to socialist construction.
    The Gequ women, who were often praised by the people, while doing a good job in preparing for planting, also actively participated in the battle of splitting mountains and digging canals, and also showed their skills in water conservancy construction.
    In the practice of the struggle for production, the commune members of Gequ further understood that only by transforming the subjective world and establishing revolutionary thought can the objective world be effectively transformed. They had a deeper understanding of the spirit of Yugong Moving Mountains advocated by Chairman Mao. They said: As long as there is the revolutionary hard work of Yugong Moving Mountains, thousands of difficulties can be overcome.
    4. Studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains": A Brave General Splits the Eagle Peak
    Splitting Eagle Peak was one of the most arduous projects in building this canal, and it was also the last fierce attack by the Gequ people to overcome difficulties and win this water conservancy battle with the spirit of Yugong Moving Mountains.
    Eagle Peak, like a sharp sword, pointed straight at the sky. Not to mention people, even nimble rock sheep found it difficult to climb. Opening a canal on this peak was unimaginable. Ma Kelimu and four other poor and lower-middle peasant commune members who were attacking Eagle Peak accepted the task and studied "Yugong Moving Mountains" once again. Chairman Mao said: "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This passage gave the four young men a powerful spiritual force to overcome difficulties, and they said: We will not withdraw our troops until we remove this stumbling block - Eagle Peak - from the canal. Since they could not climb from the bottom of the peak, they climbed to the north side of the middle of Eagle Peak from another hillside, deciding to split it in half and blast a stone gorge in the middle for the canal to pass through. However, the canal line was in the middle of Eagle Peak, more than five zhang from the top of the peak. How could they blast on such a steep and dangerous peak?
    In the face of this severe test, lower-middle peasant commune member Ma Youguang volunteered to climb the steep red slate peak. He held onto the rock crevices with one hand, stepped on the protruding rocks with his feet, and used his other hand to make a path, while also pulling up a commune member with tools. The rocks tore his fingers; the mountain wind cracked the backs of his feet. But they did not retreat and finally made the first blasting hole to conquer Eagle Peak.
    The red slate of Eagle Peak is the hardest. But it is not harder than the determination of the Gequ people! They wielded eight-pound sledgehammers and struck the rocks again and again, finally splitting it in half from the top of the peak and opening a stone gorge five zhang four high and seven zhang long.
    The Gequ people spent a total of one hundred and fifty days from last winter to this spring, crossing six cliffs and precipices, spanning thirty-three gullies, and completed the canal, originally scheduled to be completed in three years, ahead of schedule. One day in early April, amidst cheers and laughter, the water of the Gequ Gully slowly flowed to the Zhuangkou Beach, which was twenty-four zhang high, nourishing the thousand-year-old dry plateau that had just been turned over by tractors, and nourishing the hearts of every Gequ person...
    The Gequ people said: "This canal was built by studying 'Yugong Moving Mountains'! It is a preliminary result of listening to Chairman Mao's words and fighting heaven and earth." They unanimously proposed to call this canal the "Yugong Canal." (Xinhua News Agency, Xining)

### 毛泽东思想哺育的格曲人，战天斗地一百五十天，修成一条灌地千亩的水渠，他们把这条渠命名为：“愚公渠”

    毛泽东思想哺育的格曲人，战天斗地一百五十天，修成一条灌地千亩的水渠，他们把这条渠命名为：
    “愚公渠”
    毛泽东思想哺育的格曲人，靠自己的力量，一百五十天修成一条越过悬崖，跨过沟壑，总长七里，可灌溉荒地一千多亩的“愚公渠”。同时，他们还开出三百亩新水田，使每个社员平均增加两亩水地。格曲人干出了他们祖辈想干而没有干成的事业，成为今日的“新愚公”。
    一学《愚公移山》：鼓起社员斗天志
    格曲，是青海省尖扎县康扬公社的一个大队，全队三十九户人家，六十个劳力。这个大队背靠郭藏山，面临黄河。每当夏秋季节，暴涨的黄河吞噬着这里肥沃的土地，全大队平均每人只剩了一亩多水浇地。
    为了把格曲沟水引上庄廓滩，增加水浇地，去年秋收刚刚结束，大队党支部便组织全体社员和干部，开始学习毛主席《愚公移山》这篇文章和大寨、小高陵人的英雄事迹。
    庄廓滩，在格曲东面，是个旱塬。如果把它西端的格曲沟水引上去，可以开辟出近千亩水地。在旧社会，格曲人想把格曲沟水引上去灌田，但因人单力薄，水渠没有修通。格曲人学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》，树立了战天斗地的雄心壮志。他们说：有毛泽东思想的帅旗开道，没有扳不倒的泰山，没有闯不过去的火海。
    去年农历十月一日，远方的高山顶上白雪皑皑，黄河沿边冰凌层层，大地已经封冻。就在这个时候，格曲大队提出了三年修通这条渠道的计划。
    二学《愚公移山》：“阎王鞭”成了“解放崖”
    要开渠，首先遇到的是：依靠国家，还是自力更生的问题。当时，一部分干部和社员说：修这么大的工程，国家不给钱能行吗？在这种情况下，党支部再次组织大家学习《愚公移山》以及毛主席有关自力更生的文章。经过学习，人们的认识提高了，他们说：吃惯了嘴，就会越来越馋，一次依靠国家，下次不靠就不行了。我们一定要听毛主席的话，象大寨和小高陵那样，自力更生。
    毛主席自力更生的思想，使格曲人产生了无穷的智慧和力量。没有技术和仪器，大队干部和五个年过半百的老人，就用眼睛瞅，用铁锨把量，垒石头，插纸旗，做出标记。经过四次测看修订，终于将渠线定了下来。没有钢材、水泥和现代化工具，他们拿起自己家里的铁锨、十字镐，从县上借来了十二把铁锤和十八根钢钎，就干起来了。
    数九寒天，地冻三尺，山风砭人肌骨。但修渠人们的欢笑声和镐锨撞击岩石和冻土的铿锵声，把格曲沟闹得热气腾腾。
    工程进展很快，但渠修到“阎王鞭”，新的问题出来了。这座崖从沟底望去，崖头直插云天，上面尽是尖利的红板岩块。渠道能在半崖上通过吗？毛主席著作给了他们驯服山河的巨大力量。人们一个个站出来，坚决表示：愚公能凭双手移山，我们就能凭双手搬掉“阎王鞭”！大队党支部书记冶奴海斩钉截铁地向大家说：“对！先剥掉‘阎王鞭’的皮，再砸碎‘阎王鞭’，要逼‘阎王鞭’低头！”
    冶奴海脱掉棉衣，提起一把十字镐，扑向“阎王鞭”。他在悬岸上先挖了个脚刚站住的地方，往上攀登一步，再挖一个，再上一步，再挖一个，一直爬了上去。他的英勇行为，深深感动了其他社员。接着韩乙斯哈、马子利哈、蒋乙斯麻等贫、下中农青年，都爬了上去。没过多时，几个年轻的女社员也出现在“阎王鞭”上。他们用铁锨、十字镐，把红板岩块往下捣，挥动钢钎钻炮眼。格曲人的豪迈气魄，头一次震动了“阎王鞭”。
    经过几天的奋战，终于将“阎王鞭”的半壁悬崖炸毁，在这里修成了渠道。格曲人自豪地在渠道上尽情欢呼，把“阎王鞭”改了一个名字，叫“解放崖”。
    三学《愚公移山》：搬掉思想上的山
    但是，斗争还仅仅是开始！
    在滚牛坡、鹦哥嘴、流砂坡等险要地带开渠时，有的地富分子钻出来说：“这个渠要经过的地方尽是鬼门关，谁接近它谁就遭殃！”党支部认为：要工程顺利进行，必须先打掉阶级敌人的嚣张气焰，不断对群众进行阶级斗争和革命精神的教育。他们说：要想搬掉大自然的山，用革命精神改变面貌，必须大抓阶级斗争，先搬掉人们脑子里怕困难、怕革命的旧思想的山。于是，党支部在采取安全措施的同时，组织大家学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》，发动群众对有破坏言行的阶级敌人展开面对面的说理斗争，刹住了歪风邪气，激起了群众的斗志。
    年近六十的贫农老铁匠马胡赛尼，被乡亲们火热的激情所感动，也领着儿子达吾，带着打铁工具，在工地上架起烘炉。父子二人蘸钢钎、锻十字镐，争为建设社会主义出力。
    被人们经常夸奖的格曲妇女，在搞好备耕工作的同时，也积极参加劈山挖渠的战斗，在兴修水利中也大显身手。
    格曲的社员们在生产斗争的实践中，进一步懂得了只有改造好主观世界，树立革命思想，才能有效地改造客观世界的道理，对毛主席提倡的愚公移山精神有了更深刻的了解。他们说：只要有了愚公移山的一股子革命狠劲，就能制服千万条困难。
    四学《愚公移山》：虎将劈开雄鹰峰
    劈斩雄鹰峰是兴修这条水渠中最艰巨的工程之一，也是格曲人以愚公移山精神战胜困难，打好这场水利战的最后一次猛攻。
    雄鹰峰，象一把利剑直指青天，别说人上不去，敏捷的石羊也难于攀登。在这个峰上开渠，困难是难以想象的。围攻雄鹰峰的马克里木等四个贫、下中农社员，接受了这个任务后，又一次学习了《愚公移山》。毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这段话给四个年轻人以战胜困难的强大精神力量，他们表示：不打掉这段渠上的拦路虎——雄鹰峰，誓不收兵。从峰底不能上去，他们从另一个山坡，爬到雄鹰峰中腰北面，决定把它劈成两半，在中间炸出一条石峡，让水渠从中通过。但是，渠线在雄鹰峰中腰，离峰顶还有五丈多高，在陡峭的险峰上怎样爆破呢？
    在这个严峻考验面前，下中农社员马有光自告奋勇地爬上了陡耸的红板岩峰。他一手把住岩缝，脚踩住凸出的岩块，用另一只手扒路，一边还拉一个带着工具的社员。岩石磨破了他的手指；山风吹裂了他的脚背。但他们不退缩，终于打出了征服雄鹰峰的第一个炮眼。
    雄鹰峰的红板岩，是最坚硬的。但它硬不过格曲人的决心！他们抡起八磅大锤，一次又一次猛击岩石，终于从峰顶把它劈成两半，开出一条高五丈四，长七丈的石峡。
    格曲人，去冬今春总共用了一百五十天，越过六处悬崖绝壁，跨过三十三道沟壑，提前修成了原计划三年完工的水渠。四月上旬的一天，在欢声笑语中，格曲沟水缓缓流向二十四丈高的庄廓滩，滋润着刚被拖拉机翻过的千年旱塬，滋润着每个格曲人的心……
    格曲人说：“这条渠是我们学习《愚公移山》学出来的！是听毛主席的话，战天斗地的初步成果。”他们一致提出把这条渠叫做“愚公渠”。　（新华社西宁电）
