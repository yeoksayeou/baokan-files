    According to Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Jakarta News: The Indonesian right-wing military regime is making the national economy increasingly worse. Even right-wing newspapers in Jakarta are shocked, saying that this increasingly deteriorating economy is "like a tree without roots," and "it will fall with a gust of wind."
    The appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Indonesian National Front on May 28 acknowledged: "Now, the economic situation is becoming more and more serious, the people's difficulties are deepening, and the people's purchasing power can hardly be maintained, especially in terms of food and clothing."
    Jakarta's "Struggle Daily" revealed on May 19: "Jakarta citizens have recently been shocked by the price increase campaign carried out by stores in the capital. The prices, which were already frightening a few days ago, suddenly rose again, soared, and made Indonesian housewives stare blankly in front of the shop windows." "Ampera Daily" believes that "the continuous increase in currency circulation and the increasing reduction in the supply of goods on the market have caused prices to rise again."
    The severe economic difficulties caused by the reactionary policies of the right-wing military regime have made the rich richer and the poor poorer. "Struggle Daily" revealed on May 24: "The situation in Jakarta's precious goods market is very noticeable. There, prices are soaring, just like a roaring train speeding on a slippery track." "While millionaires are buying flawless and easy-to-carry diamonds...while people in the wealthy class are competing to buy precious goods, the common people who live from hand to mouth are holding money in the market, helplessly watching the ever-increasing prices of rice, firewood, oil, and salt." "Hope Light Daily" also recently admitted: "Apart from a small group of bureaucratic capitalists who have always lived a wealthy life, the facts show that the lives of ordinary people have become more critical in recent weeks." This newspaper said that for inflation, "the nanny and the officials who sit in air-conditioned offices coolly and quietly drafting plans and formulating future indicators feel different. For junior staff, temporary workers, and the families of soldiers performing tasks on the border, the pressure of economic difficulties is really worrying."
    Increasingly serious economic difficulties have also severely hit government employees, and many people are running around looking for livelihoods. "Struggle Daily" revealed: "A senior staff member working in a certain department has to save all his three months' salary without spending money on his wife or eating in order to buy a decent pair of trousers, which costs about five hundred guilders." "Ampera Daily" revealed that many civil servants have to go out to find extra income.
    The Indonesian right-wing military regime's way of dealing with economic difficulties is to reach out to Western countries for more money. Deputy Prime Minister Hamengku Buwono admitted in his reply to the Cooperation Parliament on May 23: "Since the beginning of 1966, inflation has accelerated rapidly. The national budget, which the government and the Cooperation Parliament had generally decided on a few months ago, can no longer be used as the basis for the government's work." He emphasized that "the only major way" to solve economic difficulties is to "seek new loans." However, "Hope Light Daily" worried about this kind of quenching thirst with poison, saying that "sending delegations abroad to ask for new loans and reschedule old debts" is "cutting flesh to heal sores."

    印尼经济恶化民不聊生
    雅加达报纸说：物价象火车一样飞奔，百姓吃了上顿没有下顿
    据新华社五日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权把全国经济搞得愈来愈糟，连雅加达右派报纸也吃惊地说：这种日益恶化了的经济“好比没有根的树”，“大风一吹，就会倒”。
    印度尼西亚民族阵线中央委员会五月二十八日发表的呼吁书承认：“现在，经济情况越来越严重，人民困难日益深重，人民的购买力已差不多不能维持下去了，特别是在衣食方面。”
    雅加达《战斗报》五月十九日透露：“雅加达市民近几天来又为首都商店所进行的涨价运动所震惊。几天前已经够令人毛骨耸然的物价，突然又上涨，高涨，并且使印度尼西亚的主妇们在橱窗前目瞪口呆。”《安佩拉报》认为，“货币流通额的不断增加和市场上货物供应的日益减少，使物价再次高涨”。
    右派军人政权的反动政策导致的严重的经济困难，使富者更富，贫者更贫。《战斗报》五月二十四日透露：“雅加达的贵重物品市场的情况，非常引人注意。在那里，物价突飞猛涨，就象在滑溜的轨道上怒吼着飞奔的火车一样。”“当前百万富翁们要的是洁美无疵而易带的钻石……在有钱阶层的人争购贵重商品的同时，过着吃了上顿没下顿的生活的老百姓都拿着钱在市场上，束手无策地看着日益高涨的柴米油盐的价格。”《希望之光报》最近也承认：“除了一小撮一向就过着富裕生活的官僚资本家以外，事实表明，老百姓的生活近几周来变得更加危急。”这家报纸说，对于通货膨胀，
  “当保姆的和坐在有冷气设备的办公室里凉爽而安静地拟订计划和制定未来指标的官员感受不同。对小职员、临时工和在边境上执行任务的战士家属来说，经济困难的压力真是愁死人。”
    日益严重的经济困难连政府雇员也遭到沉重的打击，许多人到处奔波，寻找生计。《战斗报》透露：“一位在某一部门工作的高级职员要买一件象样的料子裤，他得把三个月的工资全部储蓄起来而不给妻子花钱或不吃饭，才能买这种大约需要五百盾的裤子。”《安佩拉报》透露，许多公务人员不得不出去找额外收入。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权对付经济困难的办法是更多地向西方国家伸手要钱。副总理哈孟库·布沃诺五月二十三日在合作国会答辩时承认：“一九六六年初以来，通货膨胀迅速加剧，几个月前政府同合作国会一起大体决定了的国家收支预算，再也不能作为政府工作的基础了”。他强调，解决经济困难的“唯一的主要的办法”就是“寻求新的贷款”。但是，《希望之光报》对这种饮鸩止渴的办法担心地说：“派代表团出国，要求给予新的贷款和改期还旧债”是“挖肉补疮”。
