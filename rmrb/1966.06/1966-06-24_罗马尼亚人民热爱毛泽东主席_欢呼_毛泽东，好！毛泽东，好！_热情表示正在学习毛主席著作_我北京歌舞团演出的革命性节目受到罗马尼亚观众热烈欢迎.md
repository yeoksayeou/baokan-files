    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 22nd. After a ten-day visit and performance tour in Romania, the Chinese Beijing Song and Dance Troupe left Bucharest by plane on the 22nd for Albania.

    Among those seeing them off at the airport were: Ruger, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Romanian National Committee for Culture and Art; Daya, Head of the National Performance Company, and others.

    Wang Dong, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Romania, and Jin Changru, Cultural Counselor, also saw them off at the airport.

    The Chinese Beijing Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Bucharest on the 11th to perform alongside the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai during its visit to Romania.

    Over the past ten days, the song and dance troupe performed five shows in Bucharest and Pitești, the capital of Argeș County, and received a warm welcome from the audience.

    While watching the Chinese song and dance performances, the audience expressed their deep respect and love for Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. During a performance in Bucharest, when the actors of the song and dance troupe began performing the dance program "The Great Festival," and the Tiananmen Gate Tower and Chairman Mao Zedong's portrait appeared on the stage backdrop, an old lady couldn't help expressing her joy and repeatedly shouted: "Mao Zedong, Bravo! Mao Zedong, Bravo!" A university student from the University of Bucharest said to the Chinese comrades after watching the performance of the song and dance troupe: "Many of your programs praise Chairman Mao Zedong. We Romanians love Chairman Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong is the great leader of the Chinese people." An old lady expressed her sincere welcome and regards to the actors of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, took out a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from her pocket, and happily said to her Chinese friends that she was studying Chairman Mao's works.

    During each performance, the emotions of the actors and the audience were intertwined. Each program, especially the Long March Suite "The Red Army Fears Not the Long March's Hardships" and the dances "The Great Festival," "Smashing 'Strategic Hamlets'," and "On the Road to Camping," received an extremely warm welcome from the audience. Some programs were performed multiple times amidst almost continuous applause. When Ma Yutao sang "Our Moldova" and Ma Guoguang sang "George Joins the Army," Romanian songs, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, and an atmosphere of friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people filled the entire venue.

    The strong revolutionary and militant nature of the programs performed by the song and dance troupe left a deep impression on the audience. After watching the performance of the song and dance troupe, a worker in Bucharest warmly embraced the Chinese comrades who were watching the same performance and said excitedly: "Your program is a fighting art, a revolutionary art!" Another audience member said: "Through your performance, I have seen the Chinese people's diligence, bravery, and decisiveness." A student said: "In several dance programs, your actors are holding guns in their hands, which is very important. As long as imperialism exists, we must have universal conscription and prepare to fight it." The Argeș County Committee newspaper of the Romanian Communist Party, "Sickle and Hammer," published a commentary on the 15th, saying that the performance of the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe was "gripping" and that all programs "are based on the history of the people's struggle and the bustling labor."

    欢呼“毛泽东，好！毛泽东，好！”热情表示正在学习毛主席著作
    我北京歌舞团演出的革命性节目受到罗马尼亚观众热烈欢迎
    新华社布加勒斯特二十二日电　中国北京歌舞团结束了在罗马尼亚为期十天的访问演出后，二十二日乘飞机离开布加勒斯特前往阿尔巴尼亚。
    到机场送行的有：罗马尼亚国家文化和艺术委员会对外司副司长鲁格尔，国家演出公司负责人达亚等。
    中国驻罗马尼亚大使馆参赞王栋、文化参赞金畅如也到机场送行。
    中国北京歌舞团是在十一日到达布加勒斯特，随同周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团在罗马尼亚进行访问演出的。
    十天来，歌舞团在布加勒斯特和阿尔杰什州首府皮特什蒂共演出了五场，受到了观众热烈的欢迎。
    观众们在观看中国的歌舞演出中，表达了对毛泽东主席和中国共产党十分崇敬和爱戴的感情。在布加勒斯特的一场演出中，当歌舞团演员开始表演舞蹈节目《伟大的节日》，舞台的天幕上出现天安门城楼和毛泽东主席画象的时候，一位老大娘情不自禁地表达出内心的欢悦，连呼：“毛泽东，布拉沃（好）！毛泽东，布拉沃！”布加勒斯特大学的一个大学生在观看了歌舞团的演出后对中国同志说：“你们许多节目中都歌颂了毛泽东主席。我们罗马尼亚人热爱毛泽东主席。毛泽东是中国人民的伟大领袖。”有一位老大娘向中国歌舞团演员表示了诚挚的欢迎和慰问，她从口袋里掏出一本《毛泽东选集》，高兴地对中国朋友说，她正在学习毛主席著作。
    每场演出时，演员和观众的感情都交融在一起。每个节目，特别是长征组歌《红军不怕远征难》和舞蹈《伟大的节日》、《捣毁“战略村”》和《野营路上》等，受到了观众极其热烈的欢迎。有些节目，差不多是在连续不断的掌声中进行多次表演的。当马玉涛演唱《我们的摩尔多瓦》、马国光演唱《乔治参军去》等罗马尼亚歌曲时，群众情绪更为高涨，中罗两国人民友好的气氛洋溢全场。
    歌舞团演出的节目的强烈的革命性和战斗性，给观众留下了深刻的印象。布加勒斯特一位工人看了歌舞团的演出后，热烈拥抱同场观看的中国同志，并激动地说：“你们的节目是战斗的艺术，革命的艺术！另一位观众说：“通过你们的演出，使我看到中国人民的勤劳、勇敢、果断的品德。”一位学生说：“在好几个舞蹈节目中，你们的演员手中拿着枪，这很重要。只要帝国主义存在，我们就要全民皆兵，准备对它进行斗争。”罗共阿尔杰什州委员会机关报《镰刀和锤子报》十五日发表评论说，北京歌舞团的演出是“扣人心弦的”，所有节目“都取材于人民斗争历史和热火朝天的劳动”。（附图片）
