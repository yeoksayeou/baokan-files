Jin Zhonghua spoke at the closing ceremony, praising the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. He expressed his belief that this visit and performance by Guinean artists would make new contributions to further strengthening the friendship and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Guinea. Ambassador Kamala Segu spoke about the situation in Guinea after gaining independence and the cultural revolution to eliminate colonial influences. He said that under the leadership of President Sekou Toure, Guinea has reformed the entire cultural sector, including education, culture, and art. The Zoliba Dance Troupe is a product of this cultural revolution, so we can better understand the great cultural revolution taking place in China. We cheer for China's cultural revolution and congratulate you. The ambassador also said that the achievements of the Zoliba Dance Troupe during their visit to China are the common achievements of the peoples of Guinea and China. He wished for the continuous development of cultural exchanges between the two countries and the further consolidation of the friendship between the two peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

Tonight, the Guinean artists performed three large-scale songs and dances rich in fighting spirit and national characteristics: "Guinea's Yesterday," "Guinea's Today," and "Guinea's Tomorrow." These performances praised the struggle of the Guinean people for freedom, their fight against imperialism, and their happy life under construction, which were highly praised by the Shanghai audience.

The Guinean artists also sang "Africa's Battle Hymn Praising Mao Zedong and His Great Cause," enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought and sincerely expressing the deep respect and love of the Guinean people and the people of Africa for Chairman Mao Zedong and his great works. The artists also sang Chinese songs such as "The East Is Red," "Socialism Is Good," "The Brilliance of Mao Zedong," and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."
