    In the face of the fierce onslaught of the revolutionary torrent of the world's people, imperialism is both terrified, feeling its future is bleak and its end is approaching; on the other hand, it is unwilling to die and is making every effort to struggle. Especially in Asia and Africa, imperialism, headed by the United States, has launched a frenzied counterattack against national democratic movements, temporarily gaining the upper hand in some places, and becoming complacent. They clamor wildly that a "solid anchor in Southeast Asia" has been successfully created, that a "new Asian security system" is about to be "established," and that the "tide of Africa" has also turned. Imperialism seems to really have the ability to revive and relive its old dream of dominating Asia and Africa.
    Imperialism and new and old colonialism are indeed trying today to restore colonial rule over Asia and Africa, and to tightly control these two continents in their hands. They want to drastically reverse the history of Asia and Africa.
    Imperialism mainly uses two forms, firing at Asia and Africa from two directions. One form is shooting from the front, which is launching naked armed aggression and bloody suppression against Asian and African countries. For example, US imperialism launched the colonial war of aggression against Vietnam and carried out armed suppression of the people of Congo (L). The other form is shooting cold arrows from behind the backs of the Asian and African people, which is carrying out subversive activities against Asian and African nationally independent countries, plotting counter-revolutionary military coups, removing some nationalistic leaders, and replacing them with their own loyal lackeys, thereby bringing these countries back into the orbit of colonialism.
    Recently, imperialism has carried out subversive activities and plotted military coups in Asia and Africa with particular frequency. In several countries such as Indonesia and Ghana, their conspiracies have indeed temporarily succeeded. It can be predicted that the countercurrent of subversive activities against national independence manufactured by imperialism in Asia and Africa may continue to occur in the future. This phenomenon does not indicate the strength of imperialism at all, but precisely shows its weakness. It is precisely because of the powerful rise of national democratic revolutions in Asia and Africa after the war that imperialism, in carrying out gunboat diplomacy and launching naked armed attacks against Asian and African countries, has suffered one defeat after another, so they are more enthusiastic about collecting the social scum of Asian and African countries, carrying out subversion from within, and shooting cold arrows from behind the backs of Asian and African nationally independent countries.
    The central issue of revolution is political power. If the political power of Asian and African nationalist countries falls into the hands of imperialist agents, it means the loss of independence, and they will be pulled back to colonial status. Therefore, for Asian and African countries, opposing imperialist subversive activities, especially subversive activities from the US imperialism, has become an urgent task. Asian and African countries need to be vigilant against imperialism shooting from the front, and especially need to pay attention to it shooting from behind, being vigilant against it buying over reactionary soldiers and creating counter-revolutionary military coups.
    However, regardless of whether imperialism shoots from the front or from behind, they cannot reverse the rolling wheels of history. They want to return to Asia and Africa and make these two continents return to the dark ages of complete colonial rule in the past, which is absolutely impossible.
    Why? First of all, the times are different. Today is an era in which the revolutionary struggle of the world's people is moving towards victory, and imperialism is moving towards its demise, an era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind. As early as more than ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The world of the future must be a world of the people, and the countries of the world must be managed by the people of each country themselves, and it can no longer be a world where imperialism and its running dogs run rampant."
    Today, the awakening of the Asian and African people is unprecedentedly high. The spiritual conditions for the national democratic revolution in Asia and Africa are not only very different from those before World War II, but also very different from those in the early post-war period. After twenty years of repeated struggles and contests with imperialism and new and old colonialism, the Asian and African people not only dare to fight and dare to win, but also are good at fighting and good at winning. Facts have proved that the more frenzied the counterattack carried out by imperialism, headed by the United States, the more it moves in the opposite direction of its wishes, promoting the further development of the revolution and accelerating its own demise. Hasn't the US imperialism's invasion of South Vietnam with hundreds of thousands of troops made the revolutionary forces of the South Vietnamese people even stronger? Hasn't it made US imperialism strongly opposed by the people of the world and strongly opposed by the people of the United States? As for the subversive activities carried out by imperialism in Asia and Africa, it can only educate the people of Asian and African countries from the negative side, further stimulate their awareness, further strengthen unity, raise vigilance, and carry out the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle to the end. The people of those countries that have been subverted by imperialism will reorganize their forces, drive out imperialism, and take back their independence.
    In the final analysis, the future of Asia and Africa will be determined by the people of Asia and Africa. Although the imperialist counterattack may succeed in certain countries, this is only a temporary and local phenomenon. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "The world will move towards progress, not towards reaction." This is the objective law of historical development. On the road of revolutionary struggle, the Asian and African people will encounter twists and turns and difficulties, but the general trend of the oppressed people of Asia and Africa completely driving out imperialism and new and old colonialism and achieving complete independence and liberation cannot be changed.

    帝国主义重新主宰亚非的梦想一定破灭
    何江
    在当前世界人民的革命洪流猛烈冲击之下，帝国主义一方面胆战心惊，感到前途暗淡，末日将临；另一方面又不甘心死亡，竭力进行挣扎。特别是在亚非两大洲，以美国为首的帝国主义对民族民主运动进行了疯狂的反扑，在某些地方一时得势，又得意忘形。它们狂妄地叫嚷，“东南亚的一个牢固的船锚”已经制造成功了，“新的亚洲安全系统”将要“建立”；“非洲的潮流”也已转向。帝国主义似乎真的回生有术，可以重温它们主宰亚非的旧梦了。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义今天确实力图恢复对亚非实行殖民统治，把亚洲和非洲紧紧地掌握在它们的手上。它们想要使亚非的历史大开倒车。
    帝国主义主要地用两种形式，从两个方向，对准亚非人民射击。一种形式是从正面打枪，这就是对亚非国家发动赤裸裸的武装侵略和血腥镇压。例如，美帝国主义发动侵略越南的殖民战争和对刚果（利）人民实行武装镇压。另一种形式是从亚非人民背后放冷枪，这就是对亚非民族独立国家进行颠覆活动，策划反革命军事政变，把一些民族主义的领导人搞掉，换上自己的忠实走狗，从而把这些国家重新纳入殖民主义的轨道。
    最近一个时期，帝国主义在亚非地区进行颠覆活动和策划军事政变，特别频繁。在印度尼西亚和加纳等好几个国家，它们的阴谋确实暂时地得逞了。可以预料，帝国主义在亚非地区制造的反对民族独立的颠覆活动逆流，今后还可能继续发生。这种现象，丝毫也不表明帝国主义的强大，正好表明了它们的虚弱。正是因为战后亚非民族民主革命的强大兴起，帝国主义实行炮舰政策，发动对亚非国家赤裸裸的武装进攻，遭到一次又一次的惨败，所以它们更加热中于搜罗亚非国家的社会渣滓，从内部进行颠覆，在亚非民族独立国家的背后大放冷枪。
    革命的中心问题是政权。亚非民族主义国家的政权如果落入了帝国主义代理人的手中，那就意味着丧失独立，就会被拉回到殖民地地位上去。因此，对亚非国家来讲，反对帝国主义的颠覆活动，首先是来自美帝国主义方面的颠覆活动，已经成为一个迫切的任务。亚非国家需要警惕帝国主义正面打枪，尤其需要注意它从背后打枪，警惕它收买反动军人、制造反革命军事政变。
    但是，不管帝国主义是从正面打枪还是从背后打枪，它们都无法扭转滚滚前进的历史车轮。它们想要重返亚非，使这两大洲重新回到过去完全由殖民主义统治的黑暗年代，这是绝对办不到的。
    为什么呢？首先是时代不同了。今天是世界人民的革命斗争走向胜利、帝国主义走向灭亡的时代，是东风压倒西风的时代。毛泽东同志早在十多年以前就指出，“今后的世界必须是人民的世界，世界各国必须由各国人民自己管理自己，而决不能再是帝国主义及其走狗横行霸道的世界了。”
    今天，亚非人民的觉悟空前高涨。亚非民族民主革命的精神条件，不仅比起第二次世界大战以前大不相同，而且比起战后初期来，也大大不同了。亚非人民经过了战后二十年同帝国主义和新老殖民主义的反复斗争和较量，他们不仅敢于斗争，敢于胜利，而且善于斗争，善于胜利。事实证明，以美国为首的帝国主义越是进行疯狂的反扑，越是走向它的愿望的反面，促进革命进一步发展，加速自己灭亡。美帝国主义用了几十万军队侵略南越，难道不是使得南越人民的革命力量更加强大了吗？难道不是使得美帝国主义遭到全世界人民的强烈反对，也遭到美国国内人民的强烈反对吗？至于帝国主义在亚非地区搞颠覆活动，也只能从反面教育亚非国家的人民，更加激发他们的觉悟，更进一步加强团结，提高警惕，把反帝革命斗争进行到底。那些被帝国主义颠覆的国家的人民，必将重新组织力量，把帝国主义赶走，把独立夺回来。
    归根结底，亚非的前途要由亚非人民来决定。帝国主义的反扑，虽然可能在某些国家得手，但是，这只是一种暂时的、局部的现象。正如毛泽东同志所指出，“世界将走向进步，决不是走向反动”。这是历史发展的客观规律。亚非人民在革命斗争的道路上，尽管会遇到曲折，遇到困难，但是，亚非被压迫人民完全赶走帝国主义和新老殖民主义，取得彻底独立和解放，这个历史的总趋向是改变不了的。
