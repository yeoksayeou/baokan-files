    Workers' amateur designers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, broke free from foreign frameworks and dogmas, and successfully designed precision machine tools in a short period, which are low in cost, easy to operate, safe, easy to manufacture, and easy to repair.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th) The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, a Daqing-style enterprise famous for producing precision machine tools, has recently established a brand-new amateur worker design team. This team has demonstrated unparalleled superiority as soon as it stepped onto the design stage, greatly diminishing the prestige of bourgeois technical "experts" and "authorities," and greatly enhancing the ambition of the working class. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they broke free from foreign frameworks and dogmas, and together with a group of young technicians, designed two precision machine tools at a fast speed and with advanced levels.
    The two newly designed precision machine tools, one a thread grinder and the other a dynamic balancing machine, have advanced designs and many original parts; they are exquisite, simple, and economical, conforming to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. Compared with the "foreign machine tool," the newly designed thread grinder has two-thirds fewer parts, one-third lower cost, a design time only one-sixth of the original design time for similar products, and the processed lead screw reaches zero grade. The newly designed dynamic balancing machine has more than 70% fewer parts than the "foreign machine tool," a cost reduction of more than 50%, and an accuracy that can reach 0.1 microns. These two machine tools are easy to operate, safe, have stable accuracy, and are easy to manufacture and repair. This fact shows that the worker masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, smartest, and most intelligent, daring to break through, create, and challenge all bourgeois "authorities." They can not only create great achievements in general production, but also demonstrate unlimited creativity in the struggle to climb the peak of science and technology; they can not only manufacture precision products, but also directly participate in the design of precision machine tools.
    The factory's amateur worker design team was organized in December of last year and has grown to more than 120 people so far. Some of them are veteran workers with decades of operating experience, some are production innovators and five-good workers, some are skilled assembly masters, some are workers who have graduated from amateur universities, and some are cadres from worker backgrounds.
    These amateur worker designers, who grew up nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, participate in design with strong class feelings. They resolutely do what is beneficial to the Party and socialism, and resolutely do not do what is not beneficial. Their position is in sharp contrast to the individualistic position of those technicians who are only interested in becoming famous and establishing themselves. There is an electrical box on the dynamic balancing machine, and the electronic circuits inside were originally copied from foreign countries and were very complex, so they had to be improved. Someone asked an "expert" to design it. The electronic circuits he designed were even more complex than the original ones, and it would take two weeks just to assemble them. Everyone opposed this design, but the "expert" said: "This design is of a 'high level,' and if it is successful, it can be shown at the Leipzig Fair." Dong Xiaoben, an amateur worker designer and young electrician, said: "We are engaged in product design for the needs of socialist revolution and socialist construction, not for any fair. This design does not meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical. The user requires simplified circuits, and we should serve them. If the circuits are simplified, can we not catch up with the world's advanced level?" The "expert" quit and left. Dong Xiaoben and another young technician who had never been exposed to electronic circuits started working on their own. They analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of various electronic circuits, studied the opinions of many users, and drew up a sketch. After seeing it, the "expert" said: "A hodgepodge, not like anything." But with a strong determination to design for the revolution and for the people, they finally designed and manufactured new electronic circuits with good performance and simplified design after more than 40 experiments.
    In the design process, the amateur worker designers studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" with problems in mind. They firmly believe that science comes from practice, and what cannot be solved in foreign books can be completely solved in practice. Therefore, they dare to break the frameworks that "experts" and "authorities" regard as golden rules; they dare to touch the difficult problems that "experts" and "authorities" dare not touch; they have done things that "experts" and "authorities" would not even dare to think of. Their design thinking is the most advanced and most scientific. Regarding the grinding wheel holder on the thread grinder, some technicians believed: "This is a critical part, and it cannot be changed casually. Who will be responsible if something goes wrong? Let's just copy the foreign design!" However, the amateur worker designers said: "This kind of grinding wheel holder is square, which is not advanced at all. It is bulky and wastes materials, and the processing range is small; the operation is also very inconvenient. It can be seen at a glance that it is copied from abroad and should be completely changed." The amateur worker designers participating in this thread grinder project proposed several improvement plans during the discussion. Among them, Zhu Wentian, a workshop deputy director and veteran worker in his fifties, based on his experience, proposed a flange cylindrical structure grinding wheel holder solution. After further research, discussion, and improvement by everyone, it was decided to adopt this solution. The newly designed grinding wheel holder has a unique style, advanced structure, is simple to manufacture, has good processability, a small number of parts, a large processing range, and is easy to ensure accuracy.
    Why can amateur worker designers design precision machine tools? This is because they have rich practical experience, and they have also mastered Mao Zedong Thought, so their intelligence and talents are fully utilized. These amateur designers deal with machines year after year, and they have first-hand information. They know the structure of the machines, understand the key parts and components, and are familiar with the performance and characteristics of the machine tools. They are both the manufacturers of the machine tools, the actual users of the machine tools, and the amateur designers, a trinity, capable of both writing and fighting. In addition, they usually live among the working masses and have very close relationships with the masses. During the design process, they also visited users together with young technicians, solicited opinions, and actively learned from domestic and foreign experience. These factors have laid a practical and reliable foundation for them to complete the design tasks more, faster, better, and more economically.
    Many young technicians were also very active and worked hard in the design of these two machine tools, paying attention to closely integrating with the amateur worker designers. In the process of integration, they were further educated and deeply felt that science comes from practice, and the masses are the greatest authority. Only by sincerely integrating with the working masses, and truly integrating from the ideological level, not just from the working method, can they achieve something in the struggle to occupy new technical fields. They further realized that only by taking the workers as teachers and honestly learning from the workers is the correct path.
    Whether to fully rely on the working masses and implement the policy of walking on two legs in design work is a major issue of line in technical work, and it is also a principle issue related to whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road. Since 1958, many factories and enterprises in our country have generally adopted the method of "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians, and have designed a large number of products, which has rapidly advanced our country's scientific and technological work. Over the past eight years, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has undergone struggles to eliminate the superstition of foreign frameworks and dogmas, and struggles to rely on the majority or on a few "experts." They insisted on implementing the mass line and implementing the "three-way combination," and designed and manufactured nearly a hundred new varieties. The establishment of amateur worker design teams is another new attempt made by this factory under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's thought of "people's war." This is a new development of the "three-way combination," which fixes the direct participation of workers in design through organizational forms.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的工人  最勇敢最聪明最有智慧
    上海机床厂工人业余设计员大破洋框框、洋教条，在短时间内设计成功精密机床，成本低，操作方便、安全，容易造，容易修。
    据新华社上海十二日电　以生产精密机床著名的大庆式企业——上海机床厂，最近建立的一支崭新的工人业余设计队伍，一登上设计舞台就显示出无比的优越性，大灭资产阶级技术“专家”、“权威”的威风，大长工人阶级的志气。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，大破洋框框、洋教条，会同一部分青年技术人员，以很快的速度、以先进的水平，设计成功两台精密机床。
    新设计的两台精密机床，一为螺纹磨床，一为动平衡机，设计先进，不少部分有独创性；精巧简廉，符合多快好省的原则。新设计的螺纹磨床，与
  “洋机床”比较，零件减少三分之二，成本降低三分之一，设计时间只有原来同类产品设计时间的六分之一，所加工的丝杆达到零级。新设计的动平衡机，全部零件比“洋机床”减少百分之七十以上，成本降低百分之五十以上，精度可以达到零点一微米。这两台机床，操作方便、安全，精度稳定，容易造，容易修。这一事实表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人群众，是最勇敢、最聪明、最有智慧的，敢闯、敢创，敢于向一切资产阶级“权威”挑战。他们不仅在一般生产中能够创造出巨大成绩，而且在攀登科学技术高峰的斗争中也显示出无限的创造力；他们不仅能够制造精密的产品，而且能够直接参加精密机床的设计工作。
    这个厂的工人业余设计队伍是在去年十二月份组织起来的，到目前为止，已发展到一百二十多人。他们有的是具有几十年操作经验的老工人，有的是生产上的革新能手、五好工人，有的是熟练的装配老师傅，有的是业余大学毕业的工人，有的是工人出身的干部。
    这些在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的工人业余设计员，带着强烈的阶级感情参加设计。凡是对党对社会主义有利的，他们就坚决干，不利的就坚决不干。他们的立场，和那些一心想成名成家的技术人员的个人主义立场，形成了鲜明的对比。动平衡机上有一只电箱，里面的电子线路原是仿造外国的，很复杂，必须改进，有人就请一位“专家”来设计。他设计的电子线路，比原来的还要复杂，仅仅装配一下，就要两个星期。大家都反对这个设计，这位
  “专家”却说：“这个设计是有‘水平’的，搞成了，就可以上来比锡博览会。”工人业余设计员、青年电工董孝本说：“我们搞产品设计，是为了社会主义革命和社会主义建设需要，不是为了上什么博览会。这个设计不符合多快好省的要求。用户要求简化线路，我们就应该为他们服务。线路简化了，难道就不能赶超世界先进水平？”这位“专家”一听，甩手不干跑了。董孝本和另一位从来没有接触过电子线路的青年技术人员，就自己干上了。他们分析了各种电子线路的优点和缺点，研究了许多用户的意见，画出了草图。这位“专家”看了以后说：
  “东拼西凑，四不象”。但他们怀着强烈的为革命、为人民而设计的决心，经过四十多次试验，终于设计制造出了性能好、又简化的新的电子线路。
    工人业余设计员在设计过程中，带着问题学习毛主席著作《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》。他们坚信实践出科学，洋本本上解决不了的，实践完全可以解决。因此，“专家”、“权威”奉为金科玉律的框框他们敢于打破；“专家”、“权威”不敢碰的难题，他们敢碰；“专家”、“权威”想都不敢想的事，他们做出来了。他们的设计思想是最先进、最科学的。螺纹磨床上的砂轮架，有的技术人员认为：“这是关键部分，不能随便改，万一出了问题谁负责？还是抄外国的样子吧！”但是，工人业余设计员却说：“这种砂轮架是四方形的，一点也不先进，既笨重费料，加工范围又小；操作还很不方便，一看就知道是抄外国的，应该完全改掉。”参加这台螺纹磨床的工人业余设计员们，在讨论中提出了几种改进方案，其中五十多岁的工人业余设计员、老工人出身的车间副主任朱文田，根据自己的经验提出了一种法蓝圆筒形结构的砂轮架方案，经大家进一步研究、讨论、改进，决定采用这个方案。新设计的这种砂轮架具有独特的风格，结构先进，简单易造，工艺性好，零件量少，加工范围大，精度易保证。
    为什么工人业余设计员能设计出精密机床？这是因为他们有丰富的实际操作经验，而且又掌握了毛泽东思想，因而他们的聪明才智就充分地发挥出来了。这些业余设计员，成年累月地和机器打交道，掌握的都是第一手资料。他们知道机器的结构，了解零件、部件的关键所在，熟悉机床的性能、特点。他们既是机床的制造者，又是机床的实际使用者，又是业余设计者，三位一体，能文能武。加上他们平时生活在工人群众之中，和群众关系非常密切，在设计过程中，又会同青年技术人员一起访问用户，征求意见，积极学习国内外的经验，这些就为他们多快好省地完成设计任务打下了切实可靠的基础。
    不少青年技术人员在这两台机床设计中，也很积极努力，注意和工人业余设计员密切结合。在结合过程中，他们又进一步受到了教育，深切地感到实践出科学，群众是最大的权威，只有诚心诚意地和工人群众结合，而且真正从思想上结合，不是工作方法上的结合，才能在占领新的技术领域的斗争中有所作为。他们进一步认识到，只有拜工人为师，老老实实地向工人学习，才是正确的道路。
    在设计工作中是不是充分依靠工人群众、贯彻两条腿走路的方针，是技术工作的一个路线性的重大问题，也是关系到是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的原则问题。从一九五八年以来，我国许多工厂企业都普遍采用了领导干部、工人和技术人员“三结合”的办法，设计了大量的产品，把我国的科学技术工作迅速推向前进。上海机床厂在这八年多时间内，经过了破除洋框框、洋教条迷信的斗争，经过了依靠多数人还是依靠少数“专家”的斗争，他们坚持贯彻群众路线，实行“三结合”，设计制造了近百个新品种。建立工人业余设计队伍正是这个厂在毛主席“人民战争”思想的启示下，所作的又一个新尝试。这是“三结合”的一个新发展，把工人直接参加设计，通过组织形式固定下来了。
