Indonesian progressive journalist representative Supeno and the head of the Mozambican writers' delegation, João Mongovane, and member Quibusa, issued written statements and talks respectively today, congratulating the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference held in Beijing for achieving great success. Supeno emphasized in his statement that the Soviet modern revisionists' split conference in Cairo has made the Soviet Union an enemy of the Asian-African peoples, and has automatically forfeited its right to fight against imperialism together with the peoples of various countries, especially the Asian-African peoples.

Supeno's statement on behalf of Indonesian progressive journalists said:

	“Indonesian progressive journalists wish the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference the greatest success.
	“We, Indonesian progressive journalists, fully support the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference currently being held in the world revolutionary center, Beijing. We sincerely hope and firmly believe that this conference will achieve great success in mobilizing the progressive anti-imperialist forces of Asia, Africa, and the world to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. brutal aggression.
	“We are deeply indignant that the Soviet modern revisionists organized their so-called 'Special Meeting of the Permanent Bureau of Asian-African Writers' in Cairo. The purpose of this illegal meeting is very clear, that is, to sabotage the struggle of the Vietnamese people, to split the Asian-African Writers' Organization, to split the forces of the Asian-African peoples' struggle, and thus to prevent the collapse of U.S. imperialism.
	“We are fully convinced that the political awareness of the Asian-African peoples is very high, so the treacherous actions of the Soviet modern revisionists are doomed to failure.
	“We believe that when the Soviet modern revisionists engage in such split activities, they make themselves enemies of the Asian-African peoples, and by doing so, they automatically forfeit their right to fight against imperialism together with the peoples of various countries, especially the Asian-African peoples.
		“We know from our own experience that the Soviet modern revisionists have recently made the Asian-African Journalists' Association another target for their split activities. The Asian-African Journalists' Association was established in Jakarta in 1963, and since then, it has been an effective weapon for Asian-African journalists in their struggle for independence and against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism.
		“We, progressive Indonesian journalists, declare to this emergency conference and to the world that in our beloved homeland of Indonesia, the Soviet modern revisionists shamelessly support the reactionary right-wing leaders in the army, who illegally seized power, established a fascist military regime, slaughtered more than thirty thousand communists and other patriots, and imprisoned tens of thousands of progressive people in concentration camps. The Soviet modern revisionists openly provide weapons to the counter-revolutionaries whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people.
		“We believe that it is the duty of every patriot in Asia and Africa to severely expose the treacherous activities of the Soviet modern revisionists, because they pretend to be friends of the peoples of various Asian and African countries who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, but in reality, they are colluding with U.S. imperialism.
		“We assure you that all Indonesian progressive anti-imperialist journalists, whether they have escaped the terror and slaughter, or are being persecuted by the fascist military regime of Nasution-Suharto in Indonesia, or are imprisoned in concentration camps, are all closely watching this historic conference, and hope that this conference will achieve great success in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, in the struggle for the final victory of the great and heroic Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country, and in the struggle for the victory of the Asian-African peoples and the oppressed peoples of the world.”

The head of the Mozambican writers' delegation, João Mongovane, and member Quibusa, in their talks with Xinhua News Agency reporters, condemned the split conference in Cairo, supported the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference held in Beijing, and were willing to contribute to the success of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference.

They said: “In our view, this conference is not only of great significance for the unity of the Asian-African peoples in their struggle against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, but also of great significance for supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for territorial integrity and national unity against the U.S.”

    印尼进步新闻工作者代表苏佩诺发表书面声明
    苏修制造分裂会议使自己成为亚非人民敌人
    莫三鼻给代表团长等表示愿为亚非作家紧急会议的成功作出贡献
    新华社二十六日讯　印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者代表苏佩诺和莫三鼻给作家代表团团长若奥·蒙格万布、团员奎布扎，今天分别发表书面声明和谈话，祝贺在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议取得最大成功。苏佩诺在声明中强调指出，苏联现代修正主义者在开罗组织的分裂会议，使苏联成为亚非人民的敌人，也使它自动放弃了自己同各国人民一起、特别是同亚非人民一起进行反帝斗争的一切权利。
    苏佩诺代表印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者发表的这份声明说：
    “印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者祝亚非作家紧急会议取得最大的成功。
    “我们印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者完全支持现在在世界革命中心北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议。我们殷切希望和坚信，这次会议在动员亚非和全世界的进步反帝力量支持越南人民反对美国残暴侵略的斗争方面，将取得巨大成功。
    “我们深感愤怒的是，苏联现代修正主义者在开罗组织了他们所谓的‘亚非作家常设局特别会议’。这次非法会议的目的是十分清楚的，那就是破坏越南人民的斗争，分裂亚非作家组织，分裂亚非人民斗争的力量，从而防止美帝国主义的垮台。
    “我们完全相信，亚非人民的政治觉悟是很高的，所以苏联现代修正主义者的这种背叛行动注定要失败。
    “我们认为，苏联现代修正主义者在干这种分裂勾当的时候，使自己成为亚非人民的敌人，他们这样做也是自动放弃了自己的同各国人民一起、特别是同亚非人民一起进行反帝斗争的一切权利。
    “我们根据自己的切身经验知道，苏联现代修正主义者最近使亚非新闻工作者协会成为他们进行分裂活动的又一目标。亚非新闻工作者协会在一九六三年成立于雅加达，自那时起，它是亚非新闻工作者在争取独立、反对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的斗争中的有效武器。“我们进步的印度尼西亚新闻工作者向这次紧急会议并向全世界表明，在我们亲爱的祖国印度尼西亚，苏联现代修正主义者无耻地支持陆军中的反动右派将领们，这些将领们非法夺取政权，建立法西斯的军事政权，屠杀了三十多万共产党人和其他爱国者，并把成千上万的进步人民关押在集中营里。苏联现代修正主义者公然向双手沾满了印度尼西亚人民鲜血的反革命分子提供武器。
    “我们认为，亚非每一位爱国者的职责是狠狠地揭露苏联现代修正主义者的背叛活动，因为它假装是正在进行反对美帝国主义斗争的亚非各国人民的朋友，而实际上同美帝国主义互相勾结。
    “我们向你们保证，全体印度尼西亚进步反帝的新闻工作者，不论他们逃脱了恐怖和屠杀的血爪，不论他们遭到印度尼西亚的纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事政权的迫害或被关押在集中营中，都在一心注视着这次具有历史意义的会议，并且希望这次会议在反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，在争取伟大和英勇的越南人民解放南方、保卫北方和统一国家的斗争取得最后胜利、争取亚非人民斗争的胜利以及全世界被压迫人民的胜利的斗争中取得巨大胜利。”
    莫三鼻给作家代表团团长若奥·蒙格万布和团员奎布扎向新华社记者发表谈话时，谴责开罗分裂会议，支持在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，并愿为亚非作家紧急会议的成功作出贡献。
    他们说：“在我们看来，这个会议不仅对亚非人民团结起来反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争有重要意义，而且对支持越南人民为了领土完整和祖国统一而进行的反美斗争，有着重要的意义”。
