    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 11th (via dispatch) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the first seventeen days of May, local forces and guerrillas in Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, annihilated a total of 1,255 enemy troops, including 600 American aggressor troops (completely wiping out two American companies) and 126 South Korean mercenary troops; shot down and destroyed 25 aircraft and destroyed 14 military vehicles of various types.

    At the beginning of May, American bandits and their running dogs, in an attempt to escape their passive and beaten position on the Binh Dinh Province battlefield, dispatched a large number of troops to conduct "mopping-up" operations in the counties of Hoai Nhon, Hoai An, Phu Cat, and Vinh Thanh. However, they were met with heavy blows everywhere.

    On May 11th, local forces and guerrillas of the People's Armed Forces, with their unpredictable movements, attacked the forward command post, airfield, and artillery positions of the Third Brigade of the U.S. First Cavalry Division, destroying ten enemy helicopters, four artillery pieces, and eliminating many American troops. At the same time, the guerrillas also continuously attacked three battalions of American troops "mopping up" in the mountainous areas of An Duong, An Huu, An Nghia, and An Tin in Hoai An County. After suffering heavy casualties, the American troops were forced to retreat in disgrace on May 14th.

    Local forces and guerrillas also frequently attacked the enemy in the plains along Highway No. 1. On May 18th alone, attacks on the villages of My Binh and Luong Tho annihilated more than 300 enemy troops.

    It is also reported that the Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas in Tra Bong District, Tay Ninh Province, eliminated 300 American aggressor troops, destroyed or damaged 13 enemy military vehicles, and shot down two enemy helicopters in the six days up to May 20th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 10th (via dispatch) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military Region Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces recently issued a communique stating that the heroic soldiers and civilians of Cu Chi District, after twelve days of valiant struggle, completely shattered the third large-scale "mopping-up" operation launched by American bandits against Cu Chi District this year, achieving brilliant results.

    From May 16th to 27th, the soldiers and civilians of Cu Chi annihilated a total of 618 enemy troops, including 609 American aggressor troops, shot down 26 enemy aircraft, and destroyed 29 enemy tanks and armored vehicles.

    The communique stated that from May 16th to 27th, the First and Second Brigades of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division, as well as a part of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, under the cover of 150 armored vehicles and tanks, 100 aircraft, and 44 artillery pieces, simultaneously conducted large-scale "mopping-up" operations in the southern and northern liberated areas of Cu Chi District and the areas bordering the Tram Bong District of Tay Ninh Province. In this "mopping-up" operation, the American bandits, "learning" from the lessons of their previous two disastrous defeats, changed their tactics and moved very cautiously. On the one hand, under the cover of armored vehicles and tanks, they launched a "pincer offensive" in two directions; on the other hand, they used helicopters to airdrop large numbers of infantry into the center of the "mopping-up" area, vainly attempting to penetrate deep into the liberated area through this sudden attack, implement the "scorched earth" policy, and eliminate the revolutionary armed forces. However, this large-scale "mopping-up" operation by the American aggressors, like the previous two, ended in complete failure.

    The communique stated that the outstanding feature of this anti-"mopping-up" battle in Cu Chi District was that the guerrilla's killing positions were all over the place. No matter where the enemy went, they could not escape the guerrilla's fire net. They were attacked from all directions and were struggling to cope. When the enemy was beaten into headlong flight by the guerrillas of Nhuan Duc, An Phu, and Phu My Hung, the guerrillas of Duc Hiep, Phu Hiep, Phu Thanh, and Cu Chi Town immediately rushed to the highway to lay mines, destroy the highway, intercept enemy military vehicles, and simultaneously attack enemy command posts and camps, attacking from both inside and outside, intercepting from the front and back, making the fleeing enemy even more panicked and desperate.

    The communique pointed out that these victorious facts show that we are active, and although the enemy resisted stubbornly, they were still unable to seize the initiative on the battlefield. The encirclement to annihilate the Americans remains as solid as steel and, like a noose, is tightly around the enemy's neck.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 11th – Saigon dispatch: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have recently launched fierce attacks on the First Brigade of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division in the northern part of Kon Tum Province in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, severely battering the American aggressors.

    Western news agencies exclaimed that this was "an unusually large-scale offensive" launched by the Liberation Armed Forces against the American troops and one of the largest battles in the South Vietnam war. It is reported that in this battle, several battalions of American troops have been continuously attacked in recent days, and "some units... suffered heavy losses." On the afternoon of the 9th, the Liberation Armed Forces attacked three companies of advance American paratroopers. They also surrounded another two companies of American troops. On the 11th, when American aircraft came to rescue the besieged American troops, they were attacked by ground fire, and some were shot down. The U.S. 1st Cavalry Division went to relieve the siege but was also intercepted, resulting in fierce fighting. (Attached picture)

### 美国侵略者陷于南越人民游击战争的天罗地网中  南越平定省和古芝县游击队共歼美军千余  昆嵩省解放军连日发动猛攻使美军空降旅和骑一师遭到重创

    美国侵略者陷于南越人民游击战争的天罗地网中
    南越平定省和古芝县游击队共歼美军千余
    昆嵩省解放军连日发动猛攻使美军空降旅和骑一师遭到重创
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方平定省地方部队和游击队在五月份头十七天里共歼灭敌人一千二百五十五名，其中有美国侵略军六百名（其中全歼美军两个连），南朝鲜帮凶军一百二十六名；击落和炸毁飞机二十五架，炸毁各种军车十四辆。
    五月初，美国强盗及其走狗为了摆脱在平定省战场上的被动挨打的困境，出动大批军队到怀仁、怀恩、符吉和永盛等县进行“扫荡”。但是，他们到处遭到沉重的打击。
    五月十一日，人民武装力量的地方部队和游击队神出鬼没地袭击了美国第一骑兵师第三旅的前方指挥所野战机场和炮兵阵地，炸毁敌人直升飞机十架、大炮四门，消灭美军多名。与此同时，游击队还连续袭击在怀恩县安样、安有、安义、安信一带山区“扫荡”的三营美军。美军遭到惨重伤亡后，被迫在五月十四日灰溜溜地撤走。
    地方部队和游击队还纷纷袭击第一号公路沿线平原地区的敌人，仅五月十八日袭击美平、良寿两村时，就歼灭敌人三百多名。
    另据报道，西宁省茶蓬县解放武装力量和游击队在到五月二十日为止的六天中消灭美国侵略军三百人，击毁击伤敌人军车十三辆，击落敌人直升飞机两架。
    新华社河内十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量西贡—嘉定军区指挥部，最近发表公报说，英雄的古芝县军民经过十二天的英勇奋战，彻底粉碎了美国强盗今年以来对古芝县发动的第三次大“扫荡”，取得了辉煌的战绩。
    从五月十六日到二十七日，古芝军民共歼敌六百一十八名，其中美国侵略军六百零九名，击落敌机二十六架，击毁敌人坦克和装甲车二十九辆。
    公报说，从五月十六日到二十七日期间，美国第二十五步兵师的第一旅和第二旅以及美国第一步兵师的一部分，在一百五十辆装甲车和坦克、一百架飞机和四十四门大炮的掩护下，到古芝县南部和北部解放区以及同西宁省盏盆县接壤的地区同时进行大规模“扫荡”。在这次“扫荡”中，美国强盗“吸取”了前两次遭到惨败的教训，改变了战术，行军非常谨慎。他们一方面在装甲车和坦克的掩护下，分成两路展开“钳形攻势”，一方面用直升飞机向“扫荡”地区的中心空投大量步兵，妄想通过这种突然袭击深入解放区，实现
  “焦土”政策，消灭革命武装力量。但是，美国侵略者的这次大“扫荡”，也同前两次一样，以彻底失败而告终。
    公报说，古芝县的这次反“扫荡”战斗的突出特点是：游击队的杀敌阵地遍及各地，敌人无论走到什么地方，都逃不脱游击队的火网，他们四面八方挨打，穷于招架。当敌人被润德、安富和富美兴等乡的游击队打得抱头逃窜的时候，德协、福协、福成等乡和古芝镇的游击队，就立即冲上公路埋地雷，破坏公路，截击敌人军车，同时袭击敌人的指挥所和营地，内外夹攻，前后截击，使正在逃窜的敌人更加惊惶失措，走投无路。
    公报指出，这些胜利的事实表明，我们是主动的，敌人虽然作了顽抗，但是仍然无法夺得战场上的主动权，歼美包围圈仍然象钢铁一般坚固，仍然象绞索一样，紧紧地套在敌人的脖子上。
    据新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量最近几天在南越中部高原昆嵩省的北部猛烈袭击美军第一零一空降师第一旅，痛打美国侵略者。
    西方通讯社惊呼，这是解放武装力量对美军发动的“一次罕见的大规模进攻”，是南越战争中最大的战斗之一。据报道，在这次战斗中，好几个营的美军在最近几天中曾连续遭到袭击，“某些部队……损失惨重”。九日下午，解放武装力量袭击了三连先遣美国伞兵。他们还包围了另外两连美军。十一日，当美国飞机前来救援被围困的美军时，受到地面炮火的攻击，有的被打落。美国第一骑兵师前往解围，也遭到截击，发生了激烈的战斗。（附图片）
