    Fear Neither Heaven, Earth, Demons, Nor Monsters
    Worthy of Being Revolutionary Intellectuals of the Proletariat
    When we heard on the radio that seven comrades, including Nie Yuanzi from Peking University, exposed the conspiracy of the "Three-Family Village" black gang members Lu Ping and others to suppress the socialist cultural revolution in the form of big-character posters, we were extremely happy. You exposed it well, accurately, and fiercely, and opened the prelude to a thorough socialist cultural revolution at Peking University!
    Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others dared to resist the correct line and fighting call put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the great cultural revolution movement, and absurdly proposed to "strengthen leadership and stick to their posts" in this movement. In reality, they were attempting to bind the hands and feet of the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, preventing them from actively participating in this socialist cultural revolution movement, narrowing the scope of the struggle, weakening the momentum of the struggle, and turning Peking University, which has always been full of revolutionary fighting spirit, into a place like "Xiao Chen Village" in the movie "Seize the Seal," cold and cheerless, lifeless. This fully shows that Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others all belong to the "Three-Family Village" black shop. They acted against the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's directives, double-dealing and two-faced. They shouted for a cultural revolution, but in fact, they opposed the cultural revolution, using their powers to engage in the counter-revolutionary activities of the "Three-Family Village" black shop.
    Nie Yuanzi and other seven comrades boldly exposed and severely criticized these pawns of the "Three-Family Village." This is a spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to break through, daring to do, and daring to revolt. You are worthy of being revolutionary intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and good students of Chairman Mao! Your fearless revolutionary spirit is worthy of our learning.
    Revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, we support you, and all revolutionary people across the country support you. With the wise and correct leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, and with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven, nor earth, nor demons, nor monsters. We fear nothing from all the monsters and demons, and all so-called "authorities" and "scholars" are nothing! We will certainly join you in overthrowing all the black gangs and thoroughly smashing all the black shops.
          The entire cadres and soldiers of the Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army

    不怕天  不怕地  不怕妖  不怕怪
    不愧是无产阶级的革命知识分子
    当我们在广播里听到北京大学聂元梓等七位同志，以大字报形式揭露了“三家村”黑帮分子陆平等人压制社会主义文化大革命的阴谋诡计以后，心里高兴极了。你们揭得好，揭得准，揭得狠，揭开了北京大学深入开展社会主义文化大革命的序幕！
    宋硕、陆平和彭珮云等人，在伟大的文化革命运动中，竟敢抗拒党中央、毛主席提出的正确路线和战斗号召，胡提什么在这场运动中要“加强领导、坚守岗位”，实际上就是企图束缚广大革命师生的手脚，不让他们积极投身到这场社会主义文化大革命的运动中去，缩小斗争范围，削弱斗争声势，把一个一贯富有革命斗争精神的北大，搞得就象电影《夺印》里的“小陈庄”那样，冷冷清清，死气沉沉。这充分说明，宋硕、陆平和彭珮云等人同属于“三家村”这家黑店，他们阳奉阴违，两面三刀，嘴里喊着文化革命，实则反对文化革命，利用他们的职权，干着“三家村”黑店的反革命勾当。
    对于“三家村”的这些走卒，聂元梓等七位同志，进行了大胆的揭露，严厉的批判，这是一种敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢做、敢革命的精神。你们不愧是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命的知识分子，是毛主席的好学生！你们这种敢于革命的大无畏精神是值得我们学习的。
    北京大学革命的师生们，我们支持你们，全国所有革命人民都支持你们。我们有伟大的党和毛主席的英明正确领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，不怕天，不怕地，不怕妖，不怕怪，一切牛鬼蛇神都不怕，一切所谓“权威”“学者”都不在话下！我们一定和你们一道，把所有黑帮全部打倒，把所有黑店彻底粉碎。
