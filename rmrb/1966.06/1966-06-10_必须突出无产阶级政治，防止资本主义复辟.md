    Albanian "Voice of the People" Article Points Out Class Struggle Exists in Socialist Society
    Must Emphasize Proletarian Politics, Prevent Capitalist Restoration
    To solve such major and complex problems as socialist construction and defending the motherland, the decisive factor is people; after the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist economic base, the class struggle is mainly carried out in the political, ideological and cultural fields.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 8th – The Albanian Labor Party's central organ newspaper, "Voice of the People," published a long article on the 5th entitled "Work, Live, and Think Like Revolutionaries." The article pointed out that class struggle exists in socialist society, that there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and that there is a danger of capitalist restoration. The article emphasized that proletarian politics must be highlighted and revisionism opposed.
    The article, signed by Qito Chami, pointed out, "To solve such major and complex problems as socialist construction and defending the motherland, the decisive factor is people; and the main key to playing a decisive role is people with a high degree of political and ideological consciousness. The fate of socialism directly depends on what kind of spirit is used to educate people."
    The article pointed out that after the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist economic base, the class struggle is mainly carried out in the political, ideological and cultural fields. Today, in these fields, class enemies attempt to gain the upper hand, and their purpose is to politically and ideologically degenerate people, especially Communist Party members, cadres, intellectuals, and youth, and to make them embody and spread bourgeois revisionist thought, thereby creating conditions for peaceful evolution towards capitalism.
    The article pointed out, "The painful lessons of what has happened in the Soviet Union and some socialist countries clearly show that the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is not over, and the danger of capitalist restoration has not been eliminated. This danger comes not only from the outside, from imperialist armed aggression, but also from the inside, from manifestations of revisionism." "Every socialist country standing on the Marxist-Leninist position cannot guarantee that there is no danger of revisionism and imperialist aggression. Therefore, building socialism and defending the motherland, opposing imperialism and revisionism, has become an indivisible task today."
    The article continued, what does it mean to work like a revolutionary? This means going to any place the motherland needs to work, putting the interests of society and the collective above all else, not narrow personal interests; not avoiding difficult work, but being prepared to go to the most difficult places, to the main front lines of socialist construction; to work with a high degree of awareness and quality, never using material incentives as a guide to action, and having a deep understanding of the social significance of work; to have the discipline and style of soldiers in work, to be full of confidence and optimism, to oppose complacency and laziness, to be prepared to make any sacrifices, and to be determined to rely mainly on one's own strength to overcome any obstacles and difficulties; to always work as servants of the people, to maintain close ties with the masses, to consult with them on everything, and to listen to their opinions; to be vigilant while working, and to be constantly prepared for labor and defending the motherland, so as to enhance the country's defense capabilities and defeat all enemies.
    The article pointed out that a correct understanding of physical labor and productive labor, and adopting a socialist attitude towards them, is of great principle significance. Participating in productive labor together with workers and peasants is the most important school for educating and training new people. Despising and looking down on physical labor is despising and looking down on workers, peasants, and the broad masses of the people. This will lead to separation from the lives and labor of the people, and this separation is the source of all evil.
    The article pointed out that how to treat physical labor is primarily related to mental laborers, cadres, staff, intellectuals in engineering, technology, and the arts, and college and middle school students. These people cannot only love and respect physical labor and physical laborers in words, but must directly participate in physical labor, work with workers and peasants, and integrate with them.
    The article continued: Our Party has done a lot of educational work to enable all working people, especially Communist Party members and cadres, to live like revolutionaries, to live frugally, to participate in fierce struggles, to sacrifice before others and enjoy after others, and to be close to the people and their living standards. Our Party does not allow cadres to have huge gaps with the wages and living standards of the working people. Overly high wages and living conditions for cadres and intellectuals contain dangerous and harmful consequences, because this will separate them from the masses, foster a tendency to seek comfort, lead to a loss of revolutionary will, and create conditions for them to degenerate into bourgeois elements and revisionist elements. Of course, our Party also opposes petty-bourgeois egalitarianism.
    The article continued, what does it mean to think like a revolutionary? First of all, it means to think and judge like a political worker, to look at problems with a political eye, and to put the Party's Marxist-Leninist politics above everything else. This means measuring whether every action and attitude conforms to the Party's line, socialist principles, our ideals and goals.
    The article pointed out that as long as class struggle continues to exist at home and abroad, as long as the danger of capitalist restoration has not been eliminated, and as long as the struggle between socialism and capitalism continues, then the only correct attitude for correctly understanding, evaluating, and solving problems is to observe problems from a class political viewpoint. If proletarian politics is not highlighted, and people do not use it as a guide, then bourgeois politics will inevitably be highlighted, and it will be used as a guide. It must be known that no one can stand outside of politics, it is impossible to take a middle ground in politics, and it is impossible not to observe things with a political eye. What politics is highlighted determines the fate of the entire socialism.
    The article said, "If bourgeois politics is highlighted, revisionism is its reflection. At that time, socialist ownership in fact loses its socialist nature and becomes the ownership of a bourgeois privileged class that promotes bourgeois politics, as happened in Yugoslavia and as is happening today in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries where revisionism is in power."
    The article concluded: "Highlighting politics and observing things with a political eye is not only a matter for Party and state leaders, but a matter for everyone, no matter where they work or what they do. There is no work that is detached from politics or unrelated to politics, because in any place, in any field of life and any department, a given policy is being implemented, and there is a given political direction."

### 必须突出无产阶级政治，防止资本主义复辟

    阿《人民之声报》文章指出社会主义社会存在阶级斗争
    必须突出无产阶级政治，防止资本主义复辟
    要解决社会主义建设和保卫祖国这样重大而复杂的问题，决定性的因素是人；在建立了无产阶级专政和社会主义经济基础以后，阶级斗争主要是在政治、思想和文化领域中进行。
    新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报《人民之声报》五日发表题为《象革命者那样工作、生活和思想》的长篇文章。文章指出，社会主义社会存在着阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险。文章强调，必须突出无产阶级的政治，反对修正主义。
    这篇由祁托·恰米署名的文章指出，“要解决社会主义建设和保卫祖国这样重大而复杂的问题，决定性的因素是人；而具有高度政治思想觉悟的人是起决定性作用的主要关键。社会主义的命运直接取决于用什么精神来教育人们。”
    文章指出，在建立了无产阶级专政和社会主义经济基础以后，阶级斗争主要是在政治、思想和文化领域中进行。今天，在这些领域中，阶级敌人企图占居上风，他们的目的是想使人们，尤其是共产党员、干部、知识分子和青年在政治思想上堕落下去，使他们成为资产阶级修正主义思想的体现者和传播者，从而为向资本主义和平演变创造条件。
    文章指出，“苏联和有些社会主义国家所发生的事情的沉痛教训清楚地说明，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争还没有结束，资本主义复辟的危险还没有消除，而这个危险不仅来自外部，来自帝国主义的武装侵略，而且还来自内部，来自修正主义的表现。”“站在马克思列宁主义立场上的每一个社会主义国家，都不能保证没有产生修正主义和遭到帝国主义侵略的危险。因此，建设社会主义和保卫祖国、反对帝国主义和修正主义，今天就成了一个不可分割的任务。”
    文章接着说，象革命者那样工作意味着什么呢？这就是说，到祖国所需要的任何地方去劳动，社会的集体的利益高于一切，而不是狭隘的个人利益高于一切；不逃避困难的工作，而是准备到最困难的地方、到社会主义建设的主要战线上去工作；要以高度的自觉性，高质量地进行劳动，绝不以物质刺激作为行动指导，对工作的社会意义要有深刻的理解；工作中要有军人的纪律和风格，充满信心和乐观主义精神，反对贪图安逸和懒散，准备作出任何牺牲，决心主要依靠自己的力量来克服任何障碍和困难；永远要以人民勤务员的姿态去工作，同人民群众保持紧密的联系，任何事情都同他们商量，听取他们的意见；要一面工作，一面提高警惕，经常作好劳动和保卫祖国的准备，以增强祖国的国防力量，打败一切敌人。
    文章指出，正确认识体力劳动和生产劳动，并对它们采取社会主义的态度，具有巨大的原则意义。同工人农民一起参加生产劳动，是教育和锻炼新人的最重要的学校。轻视和鄙视体力劳动，就是轻视和鄙视工人、农民和广大的人民群众。这将导致脱离人民的生活和劳动，而这一脱离是万恶之源。
    文章指出，如何对待体力劳动，这首先同脑力劳动者，同干部、职员、工程技术和艺术界的知识分子，同大中学生有关。这些人不能仅在口头上热爱和尊重体力劳动和体力劳动者，而且要直接参加体力劳动，同工人农民一起劳动，同他们打成一片。
    文章接着说：我们党做了许多教育工作，要使全体劳动人民，尤其是共产党员和干部能象革命者那样地生活，过俭朴的生活，参加激烈的斗争，能牺牲在前，享受在后，接近人民，接近人民的生活水平。我们党不许干部同劳动人民的工资和生活水平有巨大的差距。干部和知识分子的工资和生活条件过高，蕴藏着危险的有害的后果，因为这会使他们脱离群众，助长贪图安逸的倾向，导致丧失革命意志，为他们堕落成资产阶级分子和修正主义分子创造条件。当然，我们党也反对小资产阶级的平均主义。
    文章接着说，象革命者那样思想意味着什么呢？首先，这意味着要象政治工作者那样来进行思考和判断，用政治眼光来看待问题，把党的马克思列宁主义政治置于一切之上。这就是说要衡量每一个行动和态度是否符合党的路线、社会主义的原则、我们的理想和目的。
    文章指出，只要国内外还继续存在着阶级斗争，只要资本主义复辟的危险还没有消除，只要社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争还在继续进行，那么，正确理解、估价和解决问题的唯一正确的态度，就是从阶级的政治观点来观察问题。如果不突出无产阶级的政治，人们不用它作为指南，就必然会突出资产阶级的政治，就会用它作为指南。必须知道，谁也不可能置身于政治之外，不可能在政治上持中间立场，不可能不用政治眼光来观察事物。突出什么政治，这决定着整个社会主义的命运。
    文章说，“如果突出了资产阶级的政治，修正主义就是它的反映。那时，社会主义所有制事实上就丧失了它的社会主义性质，一变而为推行资产阶级政治的资产阶级特权阶层的所有制，就象在南斯拉夫发生的那样，也象今天在苏联和修正主义当权的其它一些社会主义国家中正在发生的那样”。
    文章最后说：“突出政治、用政治眼光来观察事物，这不仅仅是党和国家领导的事情，而是所有人的事情，不管他们在哪里工作和做什么工作。没有任何脱离政治和同政治无关的工作，因为，在任何地方，在生活的任何领域和任何部门，都是执行着一个既定的政策，有着既定的政治方向”。
