    Competing with Floods for Land
    After the winding Danube River passes the small city of Turnu Severin in southwestern Romania, it becomes like a wild horse, rushing towards the low-lying areas. The surging river water inundates the land north of the river, ranging from two to three kilometers to more than ten kilometers wide, creating a 600-kilometer-long waterlogged zone along the river.
    After liberation, the Romanian Party and government formulated and implemented a grand plan to control the Danube waterlogged areas, gradually turning the generations-old ideals of the local people into reality. According to the plan, after all the waterlogged areas are controlled, the country will increase its arable land by 430,000 hectares (not including the Danube Delta), equivalent to one twenty-second of the country's total arable land. By the end of 1965, a total of 330,000 hectares of low-lying land had been transformed into fertile fields. Currently, this battle to compete with floods for land and to extract grain from the Danube is underway.
    Not long ago, we visited the Boianu-Sticleanu construction site, more than 100 kilometers southeast of Bucharest. When the torrential Danube River reaches this area, it suddenly splits into a tributary, flowing northward. The construction site is located at this fork. Here, there are three flood seasons every year: spring, summer, and autumn. During the spring floods, the flood peaks are especially high, and the ice blocks that rush down from the upper reaches often block the fork, turning the Boianu-Sticleanu area into a vast, white lake, traditionally called "Ice Mountain" by the locals.
    In March 1963, when "Ice Mountain" began to melt, the project to control the waterlogged land began. Teams of workers entered the construction site and first gave "Ice Mountain" a cut in the waist—building a dam along the Danube River. At that time, although the Danube River's water level was lower than in previous years, there was still a lot of water in the low-lying areas, and the roads were muddy, creating many difficulties in construction. However, the workers were not afraid of difficulties and bravely threw themselves into the battle. When it rained, they used reeds to cover their simple sheds; when the harsh winter arrived, they kept the machines running to continue construction. The veteran worker Vasili introduced us to the situation of the workers overcoming difficulties and persisting in construction at that time, saying: "Our workers understand the great significance of this project, and we are not afraid of any difficulties." Finally, this 32-kilometer-long dam was completed in just over nine months.
    While building the dam, it was also necessary to build drainage and irrigation facilities and level the land. The most difficult task was the foundation construction of the electric drainage station. The groundwater in the swampy area was abundant, so it was necessary to block the water source underwater first, then suck up the mud, and drive concrete pillars to a depth of 9 to 30 meters to reinforce the foundation. With the concerted efforts of workers and technicians, all kinds of difficulties in construction were overcome, and good news kept coming from the construction site.
    Everywhere on the construction site, one could see the spirit of Romanian workers, inspired by the Romanian Communist Party's independent and autonomous economic development policy, working hard and overcoming difficulties. We saw many workers covered in mud using huge machines to build foundations on the muddy land, and many workers driving machines to level the land with tangled roots and uneven surfaces. A technician proudly told us that the electric motors and other equipment for the drainage and irrigation stations were all made by ourselves, and many of the construction machines on the construction site were also made by ourselves. In just over three years, the workers completed a huge project on this piece of land, which was once called "the land of disaster," including a 1.4 million cubic meter earthwork dam, 19,000 hectares of fertile land, a 230-hectare fish farm, an electric drainage and irrigation station, four drainage stations, 208 water conservancy hub stations, 350 kilometers of canals, and eleven bridges. At present, the projects in four of the five work areas have been basically completed. By the end of this year, the drainage system of the construction site will also be fully completed.
    Since the start of the project in 1963, the project authorities have handed over a large amount of newly reclaimed land to state farms for use every year. The hospitable construction site director and chief engineer accompanied us on a tour of the construction site. We saw that the past waterlogged areas had now become fertile fields full of lush crops. These lands reclaimed from the floods have yielded bumper harvests year after year. Now, the yield of corn per hectare is 4,000 to 5,000 kilograms, and sunflower reaches 2,000 kilograms. The drainage and irrigation facilities of the construction site not only serve the construction site, but also bring great benefits to the nearby agricultural production cooperatives. Now, the drainage and irrigation station of the construction site has undertaken the task of irrigating 1,200 hectares of cultivated land in nearby rural areas. At the Boianu-Sticleanu construction site, we saw the efforts and great achievements made by the Romanian people under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party to build their motherland.
    When we left the construction site, the workers warmly bid us farewell. They enthusiastically asked us to extend their greetings to the Chinese worker brothers and wished the friendship between the people of China and Romania to further develop, and wished the people of the two countries to jointly achieve new achievements in socialist construction.

### 与洪水争地

    与洪水争地
    蜿蜒的多瑙河经过罗马尼亚西南部的小城市图尔努塞维林以后，就象一匹脱缰的野马，向着低洼地区冲去。汹涌的河水，淹没了河北岸二、三公里到十多公里宽的土地，在沿河造成了一条长达六百公里的水淹地带。
    解放后，罗马尼亚党和政府制订和执行了整治多瑙河水淹地的宏伟计划，使当地人民世世代代的理想正在逐步变成现实。按照计划，水淹地带全部得到整治后，国家将增加四十三万公顷耕地（多瑙河三角洲不计在内），相当于全国耕地总面积的二十二分之一。到一九六五年底为止，已有总数达三十三万公顷的洼地变成了良田。现在，这场与洪水争地、向多瑙河索粮的战斗正在紧张进行中。
    不久以前，我们访问了布加勒斯特东南一百多公里的鲍扬努—斯蒂克良努工地。滔滔的多瑙河水到达这个地区时，突然分出一股叉道，向北方奔流而去。工地就在这个叉道口上。这里，每年出现春、夏、秋三次汛期。春汛时，洪峰特大，从上游冲击而下的冰块常常将叉道口堵塞，使鲍扬努—斯蒂克良努地区变成一个白茫茫的湖荡，当地的人传统地把这个地区叫做“冰山”。
    一九六三年三月，当“冰山”开始融化时，整治水淹地的工程开始了。一队队的工人开进了工地，先给“冰山”拦腰劈了一剑——沿着多瑙河修筑了一条拦河坝。当时，多瑙河的水位虽然比往年低，但是洼地里积水仍然甚多，道路泥泞，在施工中遇到了许多的困难。可是，工人们不怕困难，英勇地投入了战斗。下雨了，他们用芦苇遮盖在简陋的工棚上；严冬到了，他们烧暖机器继续施工。老工人瓦西里向我们介绍当时工人们战胜困难坚持施工的情形后说：“我们工人们了解这个工程的重大意义，再大的困难也不怕。”终于，这条三十二公里长的拦河坝只用了九个多月的时间，就建成了。
    在筑坝的同时，还要修建排灌设施和平整土地。其中最艰巨的是修建电力排水站打地基工程。沼泽地带地下水多，先要在水下堵塞水源，然后吸干泥浆，并把混凝土柱子打到九至三十米深处，以加固地基。在工人和技术人员的一致努力下，施工中的各种困难都被克服了，工地上传出一个又一个的捷报。
    在工地上到处可以见到罗马尼亚工人在罗马尼亚共产党的独立自主发展经济方针的鼓舞下，刻苦努力，排除困难的精神。我们看到了许多浑身泥水的工人正在用巨大的机器在泥泞的土地上打地基，许多工人驾驶着机器平整树根虬结、崎岖不平的土地。一位技术人员自豪地对我们说，排灌站的电动机以及其它设备都是我们自己制造的，工地的许多施工机器也是我们自己制造的。在短短三年多的时间里，工人们在这块过去曾被称为“灾难的土地”上完成了巨大的工程，其中包括一条工程量为一百四十万土方的拦河坝、一万九千公顷良田、一个面积为二百三十公顷的养鱼湖、一个电力排灌站、四个排水站、二百零八个水利枢纽站、总长三百五十公里的水渠和十一座桥梁。目前，五个工区中有四个工区的工程已基本完成。今年年底以前，工地的排水系统也将全部竣工。
    从一九六三年工程开始以来，工程当局每年都把大量新开垦的土地交给国营农场使用。殷勤好客的工地主任和总工程师陪我们参观了工地。我们看到了过去的水泽如今已变成了长满绿油油庄稼的良田。这些从洪水中夺回来的土地连年获得了丰收。现在，每公顷玉米的产量为四、五千公斤，向日葵达二千公斤。工地的排灌设施，不但供工地使用，而且给附近的农业生产合作社带来了极大的利益。现在，工地的排灌站已承担了给附近农村灌溉一千二百公顷耕地的任务。在鲍扬努—斯蒂克良努工地上，我们看到了罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚共产党的领导下为了建设自己的祖国所进行的努力和取得的巨大成就。
    在我们离开工地的时候，工人们热烈地向我们告别，他们热情地要我们向中国工人兄弟致意，并且祝中国和罗马尼亚两国人民的友谊进一步发展，祝两国人民在社会主义建设中共同取得新的成就。
