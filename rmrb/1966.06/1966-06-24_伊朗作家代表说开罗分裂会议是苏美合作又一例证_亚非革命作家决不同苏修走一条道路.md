    According to Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd—Ramin, head of the Iranian writers' delegation, and Khosravi, a member of the delegation, who came to attend the upcoming Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing, told Xinhua reporters today: "The Soviet modern revisionists planned a split meeting in Cairo and passed illegal split resolutions. These sinful actions show that the Soviet modern revisionists have cut themselves off from the ranks of the Asian and African people and have permanently lost their qualification as members of the Standing Bureau of the Asian-African Writers' Conference."
    The two Iranian writers emphasized that Asian-African revolutionary writers are participating in the upcoming emergency meeting in Beijing because they will never take the same path as the Soviet modern revisionists.
    Ramin, the head of the delegation, said that the Cairo meeting planned by the Soviet modern revisionists was a divisive conspiracy and one of the many sinful activities of the Soviet modern revisionists to undermine the cause of Asian-African people's unity. The Soviet modern revisionists have engaged in secret and open transactions with U.S. imperialism on many major international issues. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet modern revisionists have completely betrayed the Vietnamese people's revolution. The Soviet aid to Vietnam is extremely disproportionate compared to its economic strength. How much aid has the Soviet Union given to the Indian reactionaries to oppose China? A comparison will make it clear at a glance. Therefore, Soviet aid to Vietnam is a deception to cover up their betrayal, while Soviet aid to the Indian reactionaries is the real aid.
    Ramin said: As a neighbor of the Soviet Union, the Iranian people have a deep understanding of the Soviet modern revisionists' sinful acts of betraying the revolutionary people of the world. The so-called improvement of Soviet-Iranian relations in recent years is only a small component of the Soviet-U.S. world cooperation plan. When millions of Iranian revolutionaries were thrown into prison, the Soviet modern revisionists supported the Shah of Iran's reformist plan aimed at preventing the Iranian revolution. This is an open betrayal by the Soviet revisionists of the Iranian revolutionary people.
    Khosravi, a member of the delegation, emphasized that the Cairo split meeting was 100% illegal and another example of Soviet-U.S. cooperation. Ramin finally added that despite the destructive and divisive activities of the Soviet modern revisionists, the upcoming Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing will definitely be a complete success.

### 伊朗作家代表说开罗分裂会议是苏美合作又一例证  亚非革命作家决不同苏修走一条道路

    伊朗作家代表说开罗分裂会议是苏美合作又一例证
    亚非革命作家决不同苏修走一条道路
  据新华社二十三日讯　前来出席即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的伊朗作家代表团团长拉明和团员霍斯拉维，今天向新华社记者发表谈话说：“苏联现代修正主义者在开罗策划了分裂会议并通过了非法的分裂决议，这些罪恶行动表明，苏联现代修正主义者已经自绝于亚非人民的行列，永远丧失了作为亚非作家会议常设局成员的资格。”
    伊朗的两位作家强调指出，亚非革命的作家参加即将在北京举行的紧急会议，因为他们永远不会同苏联现代修正主义者走同一条道路。
    代表团团长拉明说，由苏联现代修正主义者策划的开罗会议，是一个分裂的阴谋，是苏联现代修正主义者对亚非人民团结事业进行破坏的许多罪恶活动之一。苏联现代修正主义者同美帝国主义在许多重大国际问题上进行秘密的和公开的交易。在越南问题上，苏联现代修正主义者完全背叛了越南人民的革命。苏联对越南的援助同它的经济力量相比，是极不相称的。苏联为了支持印度反动派反对中国究竟给了印度反动派多少援助，对比一下自然会一目了然，因此苏联对越南的援助是一种骗局，是为了掩盖他们的背叛活动，而苏联对印度反动派的援助才是真正的援助。
    拉明说：作为苏联的邻国，伊朗人民对苏联现代修正主义者背叛世界革命人民的罪恶行为有切肤之感。近年来所谓苏伊关系的改善，只不过是苏美世界合作计划的一个小小组成部分而已。当千万伊朗革命者被投进监狱的时候，苏联现代修正主义者却支持伊朗国王所实行的旨在于阻止伊朗革命的改良主义的计划，这是苏联修正主义者对伊朗革命人民的公开背叛。
    代表团团员霍斯拉维强调说，开罗分裂会议是百分之百非法的，是苏美合作的又一例证。拉明最后又说，尽管苏联现代修正主义者在进行破坏和分裂活动，但是即将在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议，一定会获得圆满成功。
