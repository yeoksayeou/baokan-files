The Indonesian government has continued to engage in widespread anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities across the country in the past two months. It has incited, directed, and organized reactionary mobs to use fascist methods to launch large-scale attacks and destruction on overseas Chinese shops and residences, looting overseas Chinese property, sealing and forcibly occupying overseas Chinese organizations and schools, and more brutally massacring innocent overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government has also incited and instigated some local right-wing military and political authorities to forcibly relocate overseas Chinese.

In the past two months, in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, right-wing military personnel have gathered in groups to openly attack, loot, and ransack overseas Chinese shops and residences. They drive military vehicles through the city, arbitrarily entering overseas Chinese shops and residences, extorting and robbing at will. If overseas Chinese dare to reason with them, they are beaten. The right-wing military clique and various reactionary organizations in Indonesia have also concocted dozens of various donation names, forcing overseas Chinese to donate money. Right-wing military personnel rob overseas Chinese property on the streets and outrageously insult overseas Chinese women. In the Jakarta city area, right-wing military personnel and mobs even arbitrarily kill innocent overseas Chinese.

After the right-wing military leader Nasution inspected North Sumatra, anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities reached their peak. On June 1, the Medan military authorities organized mobs to hold anti-Chinese demonstrations, crazily shouting anti-Chinese slogans such as "Drive out the Chinese," sealing and forcibly occupying overseas Chinese organizations and schools, and taking over local tobacco factories run by overseas Chinese by the military department. After Nasution again ranted about strictly implementing anti-Chinese regulations, the Medan military authorities immediately responded, savagely persecuting overseas Chinese small traders.

In the past two months, overseas Chinese in the North Aceh region have been repeatedly looted and brutally persecuted by right-wing military personnel and mobs, with thousands of overseas Chinese families already ruined and their livelihoods cut off. The local military authorities have inhumanely forced these overseas Chinese, who are on the brink of ruin, to relocate and expel them.

With the support of the Indonesian government, anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities continue to spread across Indonesia. In Central Java's Purwokerto, Magelang, and North Kalangkuh, in West Java's Bandung, in Kalimantan's Samarinda, Bontang, and Samarinda, in Maluku's Ambon, in North Sulawesi's Manado, in South Sumatra's Palembang and Muara Enim, in Riau's Tanjung Pinang, in Lampung's Way Kanan, and in East Java's Kediri, anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities are rampant.

The right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia continue to systematically "take over," "supervise," and "seal" overseas Chinese organizations and schools across the country. At the same time, they are plundering overseas Chinese property and inhumanely persecuting overseas Chinese workers and teachers.

Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese victims across the country are now urgently requesting to return to their homeland. However, the Indonesian government, while intensifying its persecution of overseas Chinese, is engaged in various conspiracies to obstruct the return of victims to their homeland according to their own wishes. The Indonesian government's malicious intention to put overseas Chinese to death has been fully exposed to the people of the world.

    印尼政府继续在全国疯狂反华排华
    各地数以万计的受害华侨迫切要求返回祖国
    新华社二十九日讯　最近两个多月来，印度尼西亚政府继续在全国范围内疯狂进行反华排华暴行。它纵容、指使和组织反动暴徒，采用法西斯手段，大规模地袭击和破坏华侨商店、住宅，洗劫华侨财产，封闭和强占华侨团体和学校，更加残暴地屠杀无辜华侨。印度尼西亚政府又纵容和唆使一些地方的右派军政当局对华侨进行野蛮的迫迁。
    两个多月来，在印度尼西亚首都雅加达，右派军人成群结伙，公开袭击、抢劫华侨商店和住宅。他们驾着军用车辆出入闹市，随意闯进华侨商店和住宅，敲诈勒索，恣意抢劫。华侨稍加说理，就遭到殴打。印度尼西亚右派军人集团和各种反动组织，还巧立各种杂捐名目达数十种之多，强迫华侨捐款。右派军人在大街上抢劫华侨财物，对华侨妇女肆意污辱。在雅加达市区，右派军人和暴徒甚至任意杀害无辜华侨。
    在印度尼西亚右派军人集团头目纳苏蒂安巡视北苏门答腊以后，反华排华的暴行更达到了极点。六月一日，先达军事当局组织暴徒举行反华示威，疯狂叫喊“赶走支那人”等反华口号，封闭和强占侨团、侨校，并由军部接管当地华侨举办的烟厂。在纳苏蒂安再次叫嚣坚决执行排华条例后，先达军政当局立即响应，猖狂迫害华侨小商贩。
    在北亚齐地区的华侨，两个多月来在遭到右派军人和暴徒的反复洗劫与残酷迫害后，已经有数千华侨倾家荡产，生计断绝。对这些已濒于绝境的受难华侨，当地军政当局又惨无人道地对他们横加迫迁和驱逐。
    在印度尼西亚政府的支持下，反华排华暴行继续在印度尼西亚全国各地蔓延。在中爪哇的普禾加多、马吉冷、北加浪岸，在西爪哇的万隆等地，在加里曼丹的山口泽、邦戛、三发，在马鲁古的安汶，在北苏拉威西的万鸦老，在南苏门答腊的巨港、勿里洞，在廖内省的丹绒槟榔，在占碑省的务藕县，以及东爪哇的柬议里等地，反华排华暴行层出不穷。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力继续在各地大规模有计划地“接管”、“监督”和“封闭”华侨团体和学校。同时大肆掠夺华侨财产，对华侨工作人员和教师进行惨无人道的迫害。
    各地数以万计的受害华侨，目前迫切要求返回自己的祖国。但是，印度尼西亚政府一面变本加厉地对华侨进行迫害，一面进行种种阴谋活动，力图阻挠受害华侨根据他们自己的意愿返回祖国。印度尼西亚政府企图置华侨于死地的险恶用心，已在全世界人民面前暴露无遗。
