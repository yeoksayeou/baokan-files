    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou) The head and some members of the Japanese China Friendship Association Workers Delegation recently spoke to reporters from this agency here about their impressions of their visit to China, emphasizing that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding the world's people in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and is the beacon for the world's people in their struggle for liberation.
    The head of the delegation, Yoshio Uesugi, said that Chairman Mao Zedong armed the Chinese people with the viewpoint of class and class struggle, guiding them to achieve revolutionary victory. Today, Chairman Mao is using this viewpoint to guide them to advance victoriously on the socialist road. He said: "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are continuously and thoroughly carrying out the revolution, laying a good foundation for China's socialist construction, and opening up a bright future for socialism."
    Delegation member Osamu Kawai said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the development of Marxism-Leninism, and the Chinese people's revolution has been victorious under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."
    Delegation member Atsuro Takeda, when talking about his visit to Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan, said: "Through this visit, I learned that Chairman Mao established the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly from an early age. From his youth, he shared weal and woe with the people. Chairman Mao made tremendous sacrifices for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people." He also emphasized: "Both theoretically and practically, it proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding the world's people in their thorough liberation struggle." He said that now the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are striving to narrow the three major differences—the differences between urban and rural areas, between manual and mental labor, and between workers and peasants—in order to prevent revisionism from appearing in China. The Chinese people have strengthened our confidence in the communist cause, and the Chinese people have become the hope of the future of mankind.
    The Japanese friends highly praised the Chinese people's lively study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Yoshio Uesugi said that the most impressive thing in China is that the Chinese people all listen to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao called on everyone to serve the people, and the cadres, workers, and peasants in China do so accordingly. They vividly study and apply Chairman Mao's article "Serve the People," and the spirit of serving the people is thoroughly implemented in their work.
    Atsuro Takeda said that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only care about their own socialist revolution and construction, but also care about the liberation struggle of the world's oppressed two-thirds of the people. He expressed his desire to learn from the Chinese people's internationalist spirit of linking their own cause with the liberation cause of the world's oppressed two-thirds of the people.
    When talking about the Chinese people's socialist construction, Osamu Kawai said that everywhere in China, one can see a thriving construction scene. The Chinese people have promoted the spirit of self-reliance, mobilized the positive factors of people, and overcome the difficulties caused by the Soviet revisionists' breach of faith in withdrawing experts and tearing up contracts, achieving great achievements in socialist construction.
    Atsuro Takeda, in refuting the modern revisionists' slander that China's self-reliance policy is "narrow nationalism," pointed out that the self-reliance policy proposed by Chairman Mao is a guarantee for getting rid of foreign control and building a prosperous and strong country. This policy has great practical significance for Asian, African, and Latin American countries. "If the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries adopt a policy of self-reliance, they will be able to powerfully resist the imperialist, neo-colonialist, and modern revisionist policies of aggression and containment."
    The Japanese friends unanimously believe that because the Chinese people study Mao Zedong's works and apply them vividly, the Chinese people can have such high revolutionary fighting spirit, and the Chinese people can achieve such great achievements in socialist construction. They said that the achievement of these achievements is also due to Mao Zedong Thought being deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the Chinese Communist Party's policies being known to every household, everyone supporting the Chinese Communist Party's policies, and everyone consciously working for the revolution.
    Yoshio Uesugi also talked about the Chinese people's battle readiness to deal with any foreign enemy's invasion and the belief that they will win. He said: "U.S. imperialism and the Japanese Sato government that follows U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are trying to contain China. However, China is prepared for any possible aggression. If the enemy dares to invade China, the Chinese people will accompany them to the end." (Attached picture)

    日本朋友热烈赞扬毛主席创造性地发展了马列主义
    毛泽东思想是世界人民反帝反修斗争的灯塔
    毛主席提出的自力更生政策对亚非拉各国具有重大的现实意义
    据新华社广州电　日本中国友好协会工人代表团团长和部分团员最近在这里对本社记者畅谈访华观感时强调，毛泽东思想是指导世界人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的灯塔，是世界人民争取解放的灯塔。
    团长上杉芳夫说，毛泽东主席用阶级和阶级斗争的观点武装中国人民，引导他们取得了革命胜利。今天，毛主席又用这个观点引导他们在社会主义道路上胜利前进。他说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，不断地、彻底地进行革命，为中国的社会主义建设打下了良好的基础，为社会主义开辟了远大前途。”
    团员河井修说：“毛泽东思想是发展了的马克思列宁主义，中国人民的革命一直是在毛泽东思想的指导下才取得胜利的。”
    团员武田笃朗谈到他访问毛主席的故乡——韶山的感受时说：“通过这次参观，使我了解到，毛主席从小就树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想。他从少年开始，就一直与人民同甘苦共患难。毛主席为中国人民的革命事业作出了巨大牺牲。”他还着重指出：“不论从理论方面还是实践方面，都证明毛泽东思想是指导世界人民进行彻底解放斗争的灯塔。”他说，现在中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下，为了防止在中国出现修正主义，正在努力缩小三大差别——城乡差别、体力劳动与脑力劳动差别、工农差别。中国人民使我们对共产主义事业增强了信心，中国人民成了人类未来的希望。
    日本朋友高度赞扬中国人民活学活用毛主席著作。上杉芳夫说，在中国各地给人印象最深的是中国人民都听毛主席的话。毛主席号召大家为人民服务，中国的干部、工人和农民就照着去做，他们活学活用毛主席写的《为人民服务》这篇文章，在工作中为人民服务的精神贯彻得很彻底。
    武田笃朗说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不仅关心他们自己的社会主义革命和建设，而且关心着世界上被压迫的三分之二人民的解放斗争。他表示要学习中国人民这种把自己的事业与全世界被压迫的三分之二人民的解放事业连在一起的国际主义精神。
    在谈到中国人民的社会主义建设时，河井修说，在中国，人们到处可以看到一片欣欣向荣的建设景象。中国人民发扬了自力更生精神，调动了人的积极因素，克服了苏联修正主义背信弃义撤退专家和撕毁合同所造成的困难，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就。
    武田笃朗在驳斥现代修正主义者污蔑中国的自力更生政策是“狭隘民族主义”时指出，毛泽东主席提出的自力更生政策是摆脱外国控制，建立繁荣富强国家的保证。这个政策对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国有重大的现实意义，“如果亚洲、非洲及拉丁美洲各国人民都采取自力更生政策，就能有力地抵抗帝国主义、新殖民主义和现代修正主义的侵略政策和遏制政策。”
    日本朋友一致认为，由于中国人民大学毛泽东著作，并且活学活用，中国人民才能有这样高昂的革命斗志，中国人民才能在社会主义建设中取得这样大的成就。他们说，这些成就的取得也是由于毛泽东思想深入人心，中国共产党的政策家喻户晓，人人拥护中国共产党的政策，个个自觉为革命工作的结果。
    上杉芳夫还谈到，中国人民对付任何外来敌人侵犯的战斗准备和决战必胜的信念给他留下了深刻的印象。他说：“美帝国主义和追随美帝国主义的日本佐藤政府、现代修正主义、各国反动派，都企图遏制中国。但是，中国对于任何可能的侵略都作好了准备，如果敌人胆敢侵略中国，中国人民就将奉陪到底。”（附图片）
