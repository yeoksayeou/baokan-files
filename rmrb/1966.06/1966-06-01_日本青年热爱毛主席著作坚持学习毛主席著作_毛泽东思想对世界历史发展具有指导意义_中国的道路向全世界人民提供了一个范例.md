    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st—Japanese youth love to read Chairman Mao's works. One Japanese youth who is persisting in studying Mao Zedong's works said, "Mao Zedong Thought has guiding significance in the course of world historical development, and it points out the direction forward for people."

    This Japanese youth living in Tokyo, together with several other young people, organized the "Mao Zedong Thought Study Group" in October 1964. The Japanese youth who participated in this study group stipulated that they would gather once a week to collectively study Chairman Mao's works and have persisted in doing so. In more than a year, they studied a total of Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong," "On Practice," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and many other articles. Currently, they are studying Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," which comprehensively expounds Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. Not long ago, these young Japanese men and women had a cordial conversation with Chinese reporters about some of their experiences in studying Mao Zedong Thought.

    A female student studying Chinese literature at a university in Tokyo said that Chairman Mao's views on analyzing the international situation in "Talk with the American Correspondent Anna Louise Strong" (August 1946) are equally applicable to analyzing the current international situation. She said that the theory of the intermediate zone proposed by Chairman Mao is completely correct. The female student also said that through the study of Chairman Mao's works, she realized that American imperialism is a paper tiger, and the atomic bomb is also a paper tiger. The most fundamental point of this idea is to believe in the power of the people. China's War of Resistance Against Japan once confirmed this point, and today the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression also proves that the people are the real force in the world.

    A Japanese youth said that the Chinese people have gone through the domestic revolutionary war and are now carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction at home. The road that China has taken and is taking under the leadership of Chairman Mao provides a model for people all over the world. Today, it is impossible for Asian, African, and Latin American countries to take the capitalist road, and China's path of self-reliance and building socialism points a direction for people.

    A youth engaged in research work at a university said, I believe that Chairman Mao is not only a great politician and military strategist, but also a great scientist. Chairman Mao's proposal of the three great revolutionary tasks of class struggle, struggle for production, and scientific experiment is very wise.

    日本青年热爱毛主席著作坚持学习毛主席著作
    毛泽东思想对世界历史发展具有指导意义
    中国的道路向全世界人民提供了一个范例
    新华社东京三十一日电 日本青年爱读毛主席著作。一位正在坚持学习毛泽东著作的日本青年说，“毛泽东思想在世界的历史发展的进程中具有指导意义，它向人们指出了前进的方向”。
    这位居住在东京的日本青年同其他几位青年一起，在一九六四年十月组织了“毛泽东思想研究会”。参加这个研究会的日本青年规定每星期聚集一次，集体学习毛泽东主席的著作，一直坚持下来。他们在一年多的时间里，一共学习了毛泽东主席写的《论人民民主专政》、《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》、《实践论》以及《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等多篇文章。目前，他们正在学习林彪同志写的全面阐述毛泽东主席关于人民战争思想的文章《人民战争胜利万岁》。不久以前，这些日本男女青年同中国记者畅谈了他们学习毛泽东思想的一些体会。
    在东京一所大学学习中国文学的一位女学生说，毛泽东主席在《和美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗的谈话》（一九四六年八月）中分析当时国际形势的观点，同样适用于分析当前的国际形势。她说，毛泽东主席提出的关于中间地带的理论是完全正确的。这位女学生还说，通过毛主席著作的学习认识到，美帝国主义是纸老虎，原子弹也是纸老虎。这个思想的最根本的一点，就是相信人民的力量。中国的抗日战争曾经证实了这一论点，今天越南人民抗击美国侵略的斗争也证明世界上真正有力量的是人民。
    一位日本青年说，中国人民经过了国内革命战争，现在正在国内进行着社会主义革命和社会主义建设。中国在毛泽东主席领导下所走过的和正在走的道路向全世界人民提供了一个范例。今天，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的国家要走资本主义道路是走不通的，而中国实行自力更生、建设社会主义的道路向人们提示了一个方向。
    一位在大学进行研究工作的青年说，我认为毛泽东主席不仅是一位伟大的政治家、军事家，同时也是一个伟大的科学家。毛泽东主席提出阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命任务是非常英明的。
