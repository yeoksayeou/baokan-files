　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th. This summer, the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs are facing an unprecedentedly excellent situation. The Great Cultural Revolution is unfolding vigorously and is powerfully promoting agricultural production. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are deeply concerned about agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing and have decided to send work teams from the State Council and the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee to various counties and districts to help with the summer harvest.
　　On the evening of the 13th, the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee convened a telephone conference. Comrade Wu De, Second Secretary of the new Municipal Party Committee, mobilized Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of the people in the suburbs to fight well in the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing, and to achieve a double harvest of the Cultural Revolution and agricultural production.
　　Comrade Wu De pointed out that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the North China Bureau, the mass movement of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unfolding vigorously in the urban and suburban areas of the city. The wise decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee has greatly encouraged the broad masses and revolutionary cadres in the urban and suburban areas of the city. They are using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, actively engaging in the struggle, resolutely removing the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, resolutely eliminating the bad influence caused by the revisionist leadership of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, sweeping away all monsters and demons, and carrying the Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Grasp revolution, promote production, the Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting agricultural production. At present, the situation in agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing is excellent. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the North China Bureau, the people of the suburbs have overcome severe drought. More summer crops have been planted, and they are growing well. It is estimated that the summer grain output will increase significantly compared to last year. Now, the intense period of summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing has begun, which is a crucial period for winning a full agricultural harvest for the year. Getting the fruits of the harvest into our hands, planting and managing the next stubble crops well, and striving to achieve a bumper harvest for the whole year is a very urgent task at present.
　　Comrade Wu De announced at the meeting that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are deeply concerned about agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing and have decided to send work teams from the State Council and the new Municipal Party Committee to various counties and districts to help with the summer harvest. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is also giving great support to the people in the suburbs, helping with wheat harvesting in their stationed areas and in communes and teams with more wheat.
　　Comrade Wu De called on Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of the people in the suburbs of Beijing to mobilize urgently, actively participate in labor, and rural primary and secondary schools can have a wheat harvest vacation to participate in wheat harvesting, improve labor efficiency, ensure the quality of the work, and resolutely fight well in the summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing.
　　First, give prominence to politics, and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Cadres, students, and troops going to the countryside to work should bring Chairman Mao's works, quotations, and relevant editorials and articles on the Cultural Revolution, and while working, they should study and do a good job of mass work.
　　Second, harvest well, thresh well, plant well, and manage well. It is necessary to make overall arrangements and rationally organize labor. Wheat should be harvested and threshed carefully, and every grain should be stored. At the same time, we must do a good job in seed selection and preservation. The summer planting task is large and time is tight, so we must ensure timely planting. We must strengthen the management of existing field crops, seize the time to topdress, water, loosen the soil, conserve moisture, and promptly prevent and control diseases and insect pests.
　　Third, do a good job in the summer grain purchase, warehousing, and distribution. Properly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. In the case of a bumper harvest, in particular, we must strengthen education for the masses on saving grain and storing grain for preparedness against famine.
　　Fourth, be vigilant and strengthen the summer harvest security work.
　　Comrade Wu De requested that Party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership in a practical way. County, district, and commune cadres should go deep into the front line of production, eat, live, and work with the masses, and lead the "Three Summer" work well, using key areas to guide overall work. The large army participating in voluntary labor in the countryside should have their labor and life properly arranged. It is required that from June 16th, we work hard for ten days to strive to complete the wheat harvesting work.

    党中央、毛主席十分关怀京郊农业生产
    决定由国务院、北京新市委组织工作队到各县区帮助夏收工作
    吴德同志号召郊区广大人民群众打好夏收夏种夏锄这一仗，取得文化大革命和农业生产的双丰收
    新华社十五日讯　今年夏季，北京郊区农村面临空前未有的大好形势。文化大革命正在轰轰烈烈地展开，并且有力地推动农业生产。党中央、毛主席对北京郊区的农业生产十分关怀，已经决定由国务院、中共北京新市委组织工作队到各县区帮助夏收工作。
    十三日晚上，中共北京新市委召开了电话会议，新市委第二书记吴德同志在会上动员郊区各级党的组织和广大人民群众打好夏收、夏种、夏锄这一仗，取得文化革命和农业生产的双丰收。
    吴德同志指出，在党中央、毛主席的领导下，在华北局的领导下，无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动正在全市城区、郊区轰轰烈烈地展开。中共中央改组北京市委的英明决定，极大地鼓舞了全市城区、郊区广大群众和革命干部，他们正以毛泽东思想为武器，积极投入战斗，坚决搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线，坚决肃清前北京市委的修正主义领导所造成的恶劣影响，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。抓革命，促生产，文化大革命正在有力地推动农业生产。当前北京郊区农业生产的形势大好。郊区人民在党中央、毛主席的领导下，在华北局的领导下，战胜了严重干旱，夏收作物种的又多，长的又好，夏季粮食产量预计将比去年有很大增长。现在，紧张的夏收、夏种、夏锄时期已经开始，这是夺取全年农业丰收的一个关键时期。把丰收的果实拿到手，把下茬作物种好管好，力争实现全年大丰收，这是当前一项十分紧迫的任务。
    吴德同志在会上宣布：党中央、毛主席对北京郊区的农业生产十分关怀，已经决定由国务院、新市委组织工作队到各县区帮助夏收。中国人民解放军也给郊区人民以很大支援，分别在驻地和到小麦多的社队帮助收麦。
    吴德同志号召北京郊区各级党的组织和广大人民群众紧急动员起来，积极出勤，农村中小学可以放麦秋假参加收麦，提高劳动效率，保证活茬质量，坚决打好夏收、夏种、夏锄这一仗。
    第一、突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。下乡劳动的干部、学生和部队，要带着毛主席著作、语录和文化大革命的有关社论、文章，一面劳动，一面学习，同时做好群众工作。
    第二、收好、打好、种好、管好。要统筹安排，合理组织劳力。小麦要精收细打，颗粒归仓，同时要做好选种保种工作。夏种任务大，时间紧迫，一定要保证适时种好。对现有大田作物要加强管理，抓紧追肥、浇水、松土、保墒，及时除治病虫害。
    第三、做好夏粮征购、入库和分配工作。妥善处理国家、集体和个人的三者关系，在丰收的情况下，尤其要加强对群众进行节约用粮、储粮备荒的教育。
    第四、提高警惕，加强夏收保卫工作。
    吴德同志要求各级党委切实加强领导。县区、公社干部要深入生产第一线，与群众同吃同住同劳动，以点带面地领导好“三夏”工作。对下乡参加义务劳动的大军，要切实安排好他们的劳动和生活。要求从六月十六日算起，大干十天，争取完成小麦的收割工作。
