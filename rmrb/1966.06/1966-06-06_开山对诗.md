    Opening the Mountain and Composing Poetry
    Member of the Yao Nanguan Eighth Team, Yao Shan Commune, Longyao County, Hebei Province Li Zhongyi
    Man: A loud shout resounds beyond the heavens,
    	A contest is staged atop the barren mountain.
    	We farm for the revolution,
    	Grain-winning heroes, come forth!
    Woman: The sound of the hoe shakes the world,
    	Golden grain and silver cotton roll in.
    	We add bricks to the edifice of the times,
    	We add firewood to the revolutionary fire!
    Man: Chairman Mao's quotations hang on the cliffside,
    	The warmth of spring arrives early, melting ice and snow.
    	Hot blood flows through everyone's veins,
    	Wielding steel shovels, we fear nothing!
    Woman: Poor and lower-middle peasants hold the seal of power,
    	The four seas and five lakes listen to our command.
    	All land must offer grain and cotton,
    	All mountains must bloom with red flowers!
    Man: The will of the poor and lower-middle peasants is firm,
    	Heroes fear no hardship in starting a new enterprise.
    	One load of stones, one basket of earth,
    	Are all closely connected to the revolution.
    Woman: Chairman Mao teaches us to sharpen our eyes,
    	Chairman Mao gives us courage throughout our bodies.
    	There are still evil wolves in the world,
    	Grow grain to use as bullets!
    All: Learn from Wang Jie in everything we do.
    	Strive to catch up with Dazhai in every step we take,
    	Rely on our own efforts and strive for the upper reaches,
    	Run on the road of revolution!

    开山对诗
    河北省隆尧县尧山公社尧南关第八队社员  李中义男：大喝一声传天外，
    荒山顶上摆擂台。
    咱们种田为革命，
    夺粮英雄走上来！女：镐头一响震世界，
    金谷银棉滚滚来。
    时代大厦咱加砖，
    革命烈火咱添柴！男：主席语录崖头挂，
    阳春早到冰雪化。
    人人身上滚热流，
    手挥钢锨天不怕！女：贫下中农掌印把，
    五湖四海听管辖。
    是地都要献粮棉，
    是山都要开红花！男：贫下中农意志坚，
    英雄不怕创业难。
    一担石头一筐土，
    都和革命紧相连。女：毛主席教咱擦亮眼，
    毛主席给咱浑身胆。
    世界还有恶狼在，
    种出粮食当子弹！合：办事处处学王杰。
    走路步步赶大寨，
    自力更生争上游，
    革命路上跑起来！
