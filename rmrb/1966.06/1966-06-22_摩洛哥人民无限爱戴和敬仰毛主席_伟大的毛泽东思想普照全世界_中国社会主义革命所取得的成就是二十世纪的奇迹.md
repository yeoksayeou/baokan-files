    Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Rabat news: Moroccan audiences who visited the Chinese Lantern, New Year Picture, and Paper-cut Exhibition held in the capital Rabat, some on the guestbook, and some to Chinese staff, expressed their love and respect for Chairman Mao, and were encouraged by the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Some viewers cheered, "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time," and "The great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world." They enthusiastically praised "The achievements made by the Chinese people in building their motherland and in the anti-imperialist struggle are the pride of all countries striving to liberate themselves from imperialist rule!"
    This exhibition closed on the 19th. In the thirteen days since its opening on the 7th, it received more than 8,000 visitors and was warmly welcomed. It is rare for an art exhibition held in Rabat to have such an enthusiastic audience.
    Many viewers lingered for a long time in front of Chairman Mao's portraits, carefully examining them, reluctant to leave. A young man said, "Chairman Mao is the embodiment of the Chinese people, he is the one who leads the Chinese people from victory to victory, you are so fortunate to have Chairman Mao leading you!" Two educators visited the exhibition more than ten times. They said: "We like the New Year picture 'Chairman Mao and We are of One Heart' the most. Chairman Mao maintains close ties with the working people, and people united around Chairman Mao like this are not afraid of anything."
    Another viewer said: "The exhibition reflects the amazing progress China has made in all aspects. The immortal genius and achievements of the Chinese people are due to the great hero Mao Zedong." A law student said: "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, and the great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world, guiding the liberation struggles of the people of all countries." The college student asked the Chinese staff to give him a portrait of Chairman Mao, which he wanted to hang at home to express his respect for Chairman Mao.
    More viewers wrote down their love for Chairman Mao in the guestbook. Some said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest person in the world," "This exhibition shows Chairman Mao's genius." Some said, "Glory to Chairman Mao, who is loyal to the Chinese people and the people of the world." Others said, "I have boundless respect and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao," "I thank Mao Zedong," "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    The audience warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people and regarded it as a contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries. Opening the guestbook, one can see words like these: "The achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of their wise leader Mao Zedong in the socialist revolution are a miracle of the twentieth century!" "China is a bright pearl shining among the nations of the world." "Long live the Great Leap Forward in China!" "May the great friend - China further develop and achieve victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism!"
    The Moroccan people also highly appreciated Chinese art. They often used words such as "wonderful," "superb," "the best," and "the noblest" to praise Chinese artworks. Some viewers said, "This is the most artistic exhibition I have ever seen," "The Chinese people are diligent, intelligent, and most patient, so they can create such wonderful art," "These exhibits demonstrate the skills and creativity of the working people."
    During the exhibition, there was a continuous stream of visitors every day. Many housewives also took their children to visit and listened to the explanations of the narrators with great interest. Many people also traveled to the capital from other places to visit. A worker who traveled 600 kilometers to the capital said: "This exhibition is so good that it makes me understand the life and struggle of the Chinese people and Comrade Mao Zedong. I hope you will hold more such exhibitions." (Attached picture)

    摩洛哥人民无限爱戴和敬仰毛主席
    伟大的毛泽东思想普照全世界
    中国社会主义革命所取得的成就是二十世纪的奇迹
    新华社二十一日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥观众在参观了首都拉巴特举行的中国灯彩、年画、剪纸展览后，有的在留言簿上，有的向中国工作人员表达了他们对毛泽东主席的爱戴和敬仰，对中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下取得的巨大成就感到鼓舞。有的观众欢呼，“毛泽东是当代的列宁”，“伟大的毛泽东思想普照全世界”。他们热情地赞扬“中国人民在建设祖国和反帝斗争中取得的成就是一切为争取从帝国主义统治下解放出来的国家的骄傲！”
    这个展览会已在十九日闭幕。从七日开幕以来的十三天中，它共接纳了八千多名观众，受到了热烈的欢迎。在拉巴特举行的艺术展览中，观众如此踊跃，是非常罕见的。
    许多观众在毛主席的画象前长久停留，细细端详，不愿离去。一位青年说：“毛主席是中国人民的化身，是他领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利，你们有毛主席领导真幸福啊！”有两位教育工作者参观了展览十多次。他们说：“我们最喜欢‘毛主席和我们心连心’这幅年画，毛主席同劳动人民保持着密切联系，而象这样团结在毛主席周围的人民是什么都不怕的”。
    另一位观众说：“展览反映了中国在各方面所取得的惊人进步。中国人民的不朽天才与成就归功于伟大的英雄毛泽东。”一位法学院的学生说：“毛泽东是当代的列宁，伟大的毛泽东思想普照全世界，指引着各国人民进行解放斗争”。这位大学生要求中国工作人员送给他一幅毛主席象，他要挂在家中，以表达对毛主席的敬仰。
    更多的观众在留言簿上写下了他们对毛主席的热爱心情。有的说，“毛主席是世界上最伟大的人物”，“这个展览会表现了毛主席的天才”。有的说，“光荣归于忠实于中国人民和世界人民的毛泽东主席。”也有的说，“我对伟大的领袖毛主席无限尊敬和爱慕”，“我感谢毛泽东”，“毛泽东万岁！”
    观众们热烈赞颂中国人民所取得的伟大成就，并且把它看作是对各国人民进行反帝斗争的贡献。翻开留言簿，人们可以看到这样的一些话：“中国人民在他们的英明的领袖毛泽东的领导下，在社会主义革命中所取得的成就是二十世纪的奇迹！”“中国是世界各民族中闪射光芒的明珠。”“中国大跃进万岁！”“愿伟大的朋友——中国进一步发展，并取得反对美帝国主义斗争的胜利！”
    摩洛哥人民还高度评价中国的艺术。他们常常用“精采”，“高超”，“最美好”，“最高尚”等字眼来称赞中国的艺术作品。有些观众说：“这是我所看到的艺术性最高的一次展览”，“中国人民勤劳、智慧、最有耐心，因此能创造出这样美妙的艺术”，“这些展品表现了劳动人民的技巧和创造才能”。
    在展览期间，每天参观的人络绎不绝。许多家庭妇女也抱着孩子去参观，并且怀着很大的兴趣听讲解员的解说。还有不少人是从外地赶到首都参观的，一位从六百公里外到首都参观的工人说：“这个展览太好了，使我了解到中国人民和毛泽东同志的生活斗争情况。希望你们多举办这样的展览。”（附图片）
