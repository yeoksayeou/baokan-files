    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, June 9th -- Medjahar Abdelkader, head of the Algerian General Workers' Union delegation who recently returned from a visit to China and participation in the "May Day" celebrations, said in an interview with Xinhua reporters here on the 5th: "We believe that Mao Zedong is a great politician. The world revolution should have a leader, and that leader is now Mao Zedong, because his writings and his theories not only conform to the reality of the Chinese revolution, but also conform to the reality of the world proletarian revolution."
    Abdelkader said that Chairman Mao's theory of encircling the cities from the countryside is of particular importance. This fundamental theory not only conformed to the reality of the Chinese revolution at that time, but also conforms to the reality of the world revolution now, because today, on a global scale, the big cities are the United States, while the vast countryside is revolutionary Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    He warmly praised the correct socialist construction policies pursued by the Chinese people and the working class under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the great achievements made in various fields such as industry and agriculture. He said, "What China is implementing is a genuine Marxist-Leninist line." He also said that the reason why China has been able to achieve such great achievements in such a short period of time is because China has a great political leader and a great strategist, Mao Zedong.
    He also said that it is precisely because Chairman Mao put forward the construction policy of self-reliance that China has been able to build from scratch and has reached an advanced level in many aspects such as industry and agriculture today.
    He said that China's adoption of the policy of self-reliance to build and overcome difficulties is also an encouragement to them.
    Abdelkader finally said that from his visit to China, he found that the Chinese people are determined to fight back against the aggression of US imperialism and are prepared spiritually and materially.

    阿尔及利亚工会代表团长说中国实行真正马列主义路线
    毛泽东是世界革命的带路人
    毛主席提出农村包围城市的理论符合世界革命实际具有重大意义
    新华社阿尔及尔九日电　最近应邀访问中国和参加“五一”观礼归来的阿尔及利亚工人总联合会代表团团长梅贾海尔·阿卜代尔卡达尔五日在这里接见新华社记者时说：“我们认为，毛泽东是伟大的政治家。世界革命应该有带路人，而这个带路人现在就是毛泽东，因为他的著作、他的理论不仅符合中国革命的实际，而且也符合世界无产阶级革命的实际。”
    阿卜代尔卡达尔说，毛主席提出的农村包围城市的理论是具有特别重要意义的。这个带根本性的理论不仅当时符合中国革命的实际，而且现在也符合世界革命的实际，因为今天从世界范围来说，大城市就是美国，而广大农村就是革命的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。
    他热烈赞扬中国人民和工人阶级在毛主席领导下执行的正确的社会主义建设方针和在工农业等各方面所取得的伟大成就。他说，“中国所实行的是真正的马克思列宁主义的路线。”他又说，中国之所以能够在这么短的时间内取得了这么伟大的成就，是因为中国有伟大的政治领袖和伟大的战略家毛泽东。
    他还说，正是由于毛主席提出了自力更生的建设方针，中国才能够基本上从白手起家进行建设，直到今天已在工农业等许多方面达到了先进的水平。
    他说，中国采取自力更生的方针来建设和克服困难，对他们也是一个鼓舞。
    阿卜代尔卡达尔最后说，从他在中国访问过程中发现，中国人民决心反击美帝国主义的侵略，并且已在精神和物质上作好了准备。
