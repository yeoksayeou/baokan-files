    Anhui Province has expanded its jute planting area by more than two times compared to last year. The jute north of the Huai River has now emerged from the soil to a height of two inches.
    In previous years, some people believed that jute was suitable for planting in the south and could not be grown north of the Huai River. Anhui Province has proven through two years of trial planting that not only can jute be planted in the Huaibei area, but it can also achieve high yields. Jute is a flood-resistant crop, particularly suitable for planting in low-lying land along the Huai River.

    安徽省黄麻种植面积扩大
    安徽省今年黄麻种植面积比去年扩大了两倍多。淮河以北的黄麻，现已出土二寸来高。
    前几年，有人认为，黄麻适宜在南方种植，不能过淮河。安徽省经过两年试种证实，淮北地区不但能种黄麻，而且能获得高产。黄麻是一种耐涝的作物，特别适宜栽种在淮河沿岸低洼的土地上。
