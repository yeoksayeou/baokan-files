    Report by Osman Hassan Ahmed, Head of the Sudanese Delegation
    New China News Agency, June 29th: Today, at the emergency meeting of the Afro-Asian Writers, Osman Hassan Ahmed, head of the Sudanese delegation, said that on the stage of the African revolution, apart from the American imperialists, a new enemy has emerged, that is, the modern revisionists centered around the new leadership of the CPSU. The revisionists are trying to extinguish the flames of the African revolution and are the true accomplices of imperialism.

    Osman said that the modern revisionists centered around the new leadership of the CPSU are doing everything in their power to make the African people deviate from their main struggle, advocating that the African national democratic revolution has completed its mission and that the main task facing the African people now is economic construction. This is in complete harmony with the line of Sino-American cooperation to dominate the world.

    He pointed out that this is a big lie, a wrong line, and completely contrary to the facts. Has imperialism withdrawn from Africa? No, not at all. Imperialism, led by the United States (the number one enemy of the people of the world), old and new colonialism, is reaching out its hands to strengthen its control over these countries. In Africa, are there no local puppets and reactionaries directly serving imperialism? No, there are people like Mobutu, Ankara, Tshombe, and all the faithful servants of imperialism. Have the semi-feudal systems that dominate most of our African countries been abolished? No, not at all. These are naked facts, facts that everyone can see with their own eyes.

    He said that the revisionists are shouting at the top of their lungs about "peaceful transition," "peaceful evolution," "peaceful coexistence," and so on. Their sole purpose is to extinguish the flames of the African revolution and to serve the imperialists led by the United States in every possible way. In the end, we find that they are the true accomplices of imperialism. Even more dangerous than imperialism because they disguise themselves under the name of great Marxism-Leninism.

    Osman said that Vietnam is the current focus of the world struggle. The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people have already dealt and are dealing a fatal blow to American imperialism, proving that American imperialism is a paper tiger and will ultimately be destroyed.

    He said that the war in South Vietnam is an example for the people of Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. It proves that true independence, freedom, and sovereignty cannot be obtained through negotiations or begging, as some traitors to Marxism-Leninism claim. Imperialists only understand the language of armed revolution. The great Marxist Mao Zedong has pointed out that in opposing enemies who have knives in both hands, the people must also have knives and must fight back according to his methods. Chairman Mao also emphasized that in the history of the Chinese revolution, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

    He said that after the people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam, the American people, and the people of the world strongly rejected the American "unconditional negotiation" fraud and exposed the true nature of the so-called peace talks, the American imperialists turned to the new leadership of the Soviet Union to save them from their predicament. They found such a loyal friend in the new leadership of the Soviet Union, who spared no effort to promote these infamous and unwelcome "negotiations" everywhere, including in the United Nations, a notorious tool of the United States. The modern revisionists centered around the new leadership of the Soviet Union have always supported the Vietnamese people verbally, but in reality, they have always negotiated with the American gangsters at the expense of the blood and lives of the Vietnamese people.

    He said that we must live among the masses, sharing their joys and sorrows, so that our works will be true and not abstract. The pen of the writer and the gun of the soldier are equally powerful, and the pen should be used in the struggle against imperialism and its accomplices. If we forget the struggle against imperialism in our writing, it will be like having no backbone. As long as imperialism exists, we must remain vigilant and expose it, so that everyone can see its true face. We should not, like the revisionist writers, spread bourgeois ideas, bourgeois humanism, and bourgeois concepts of freedom, equality, and fraternity.

    Some of us Afro-Asian writers have been deceived by the Soviet Union and are in the dark, but after they realize the truth, they should cherish the powerful fighting unity of our revolutionary movement. To persist in the wrong path, to further engage in splitting activities, and to act as a tame tool in the hands of the new leadership of the Soviet Union—the traitor to the world revolution and the last bastion of world reactionaries, American imperialism—is an unforgivable mistake. History will never forgive them. Our urgent task is to expose those traitors so that the people of the world can understand and more clearly know who their friends are and who their enemies are; who are the real splitters and who are cherishing and defending our revolutionary movement.

    He said that the revolutionary people, the true masses, and the true freedom fighters know very well the essence of modern revisionism. The policy of modern revisionism is completely centered around Sino-American cooperation to dominate the world. Their policy is complete submission to American imperialism, and their line is to engage in splitting activities within the world liberation movement. Naked facts show that they are responsible for the death of the heroic fighter Patrice Lumumba; their position on the Vietnam issue—the focus of world policy—is fake support and real betrayal of the Vietnamese people. Soviet revisionists collude with all traitors, rightists, reactionaries, and betrayers to engage in various evil activities to ensure the implementation of this line.

    He said that the statement issued by the permanent committee of the Afro-Asian Writers fully expresses our true position towards these traitors and saboteurs of Afro-Asian unity.

    Finally, he spoke about the development of national culture among the people in Afro-Asian countries. He cited numerous facts to show that imperialist and other decadent literature and art, especially the decadent art of American imperialism, are rampant in the two continents of Asia and Africa. He said that to fight against this cultural invasion, we Afro-Asian writers must develop our own national culture.

    He said that the path of developing its own national culture by the People's Republic of China is worth studying and learning. Chinese revolutionary artists and cultural workers have successfully changed the content in ballet, opera, drama, songs, sculptures, and other fields, breaking through all obstacles, making art serve the broad masses instead of a small group of bourgeoisie. This experience of the Chinese cultural revolution is worth noting.

    He said that the struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors always begins in the ideological realm and is rooted in all aspects of culture. Before a class seizes power, it must first defeat the ideology of the opposing class and spread its own ideology. Therefore, to expose and smash the enemy's ideology, we must spread our own ideology through the propaganda machine. This is an important task for us Afro-Asian writers.

    苏丹代表团团长奥斯曼的报告
    新华社二十九日讯　苏丹代表团团长奥斯曼·哈桑·艾哈迈德今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，在非洲革命的舞台上，除美帝国主义者外，出现了一个新的敌人，这就是以苏共新领导为中心的现代修正主义者。修正主义者力图扑灭非洲革命的火焰，是帝国主义的真正帮凶。
    奥斯曼说，以苏共新领导为中心的现代修正主义者，竭尽全力使非洲人民背离他们的主要斗争，宣扬什么非洲民族民主革命已以完成任务而告终，非洲人民现在面临的主要任务是进行经济建设。而这和苏美合作主宰世界的路线是完全合拍的。
    他指出，这是个弥天大谎，是一条错误的路线，是完全违反事实的。帝国主义退出了非洲吗？不，一千个没有。以美国（世界人民的头号敌人）为首的帝国主义，新老殖民主义正伸出它们的手来。对这些国家日益加强控制。在非洲难道没有直接为帝国主义服务的当地傀儡和反动派吗？不，有蒙博托、安卡拉、冲伯之流以及和他们一样的所有帝国主义的忠实奴仆，在我们大多数非洲国家占统治地位的半封建制度已经废除了吗？没有，一千个没有。这些是赤裸裸的事实，是每个人可以亲眼看到的事实。
    他说，修正主义者声嘶力竭地叫嚷“和平过渡”，“和平演变”，“和平共处”等等，其唯一的目的是要扑灭非洲革命的火焰，是千方百计地为以美帝为首的帝国主义者效劳。归根到底，我们发现他们是帝国主义者的真正帮凶。甚至比帝国主义还要危险，因为他们用伟大的马克思列宁主义的名义把自己伪装起来。
    奥斯曼说，越南是当前世界斗争的焦点。越南人民所取得的伟大胜利，对美帝国主义已经给予的和正在给予的致命打击，证明美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，最后终将被击毁。
    他说，越南南方的战争，对于亚洲、非洲和世界上其它地方的人民，是一个范例，它证明真正的独立、自由和主权不能象一些马克思列宁主义的叛徒所宣称的那样，用谈判或乞求去获得。帝国主义者只懂得武装革命的语言。伟大的马克思主义者毛泽东主席已经指出，在反对双手都拿着屠刀的敌人时，人民也有手，必须按照他的办法也拿起刀来，进行针锋相对的斗争。毛主席还强调说，在中国革命史上，枪杆子里面出政权。
    他说，当越南南方和北方人民、美国人民和世界其他人民一道有力地拒绝了美国“无条件谈判”的骗局并揭露所谓和谈的实质以后，美帝国主义者就求助于苏联新领导把他们救出困境。他们找到了苏联新领导这样忠实的朋友，苏联新领导不遗余力地到处——包括在美帝的著名工具联合国——宣传这些臭名昭彰的、不受欢迎的“谈判”。以苏联新领导为中心的现代修正主义者一直在口头上支持越南人民，但实际上却一贯以越南人民的鲜血和生命同美国匪帮谈判。
    他说，我们应当生活在群众之中，和他们同甘共苦，这样我们的作品就会是真实的而不是抽象的。作家的笔杆子和战士的枪杆子是同样有力量的，笔杆子应当用于反对帝国主义者及其帮凶的斗争。在我们的写作中忘掉反对帝国主义的斗争就会象没有脊梁骨一样。只要帝国主义还存在，我们就必须保持警惕，并且揭露它，使人人都能看清它的真面目。我们不应当象修正主义作家那样散布资产阶级思想，资产阶级的人性论和自由、平等、博爱等资产阶级观念。
    我们亚非作家中有一些人受了苏联的欺骗，蒙在鼓里，但是在他们明白过来以后，就应该珍视我们革命运动的强大的战斗团结。坚持错误的道路，进一步进行分裂活动，充当苏联新领导——世界革命的叛徒和世界反动派最后堡垒美帝国主义的帮凶——手中的驯服工具，是一个不可原谅的错误。历史将永远不会饶恕他们。我们的迫切任务是揭露那些叛徒，使世界人民能懂得并更清楚地了解，谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人；谁是真正的分裂主义者，谁在珍视和保卫我们的革命运动。
    他说，革命的人民，真正的群众，真正的自由战士们，很清楚地知道现代修正主义者的本质。现代修正主义者的政策完全是以苏美合作主宰世界为中心的。他们的政策是对美帝国主义完全屈从，他们的路线是在世界解放运动内部进行分裂活动。赤裸裸的事实表明他们要对英雄的战士帕特利斯·卢蒙巴之死负责；他们对越南问题——世界政策的焦点的立场是对越南人民假支持，真出卖。苏联修正主义者同一切叛徒、右派分子、反动分子和叛卖者勾结，进行各种各样邪恶活动以保证贯彻这条路线。
    他说，亚非作家常设局会议发表的声明充分表达了我们对这个亚非团结的叛徒和破坏者的真正立场。
    他最后谈到在亚非国家发展人民的民族文化问题。他列举大量事实说明，帝国主义的和其他腐朽的文学艺术，特别是美帝国主义的腐朽文艺，正在亚非两大洲泛滥。他说，为了同这种文化侵略进行斗争，我们亚非作家必须发展自己的民族文化。
    他说，中华人民共和国发展自己民族文化的道路值得研究和学习。中国的革命艺术家和文化工作者在芭蕾舞、歌剧、话剧、歌曲、雕塑等方面，破除了一切障碍，成功地改变了内容，使艺术为广大群众服务，而不再为一小撮资产阶级分子服务。中国文化革命的这一经验值得我们注意。
    他说，被压迫者和压迫者之间的斗争总是先从意识形态领域里开始并植根于文化的一切方面。在一个阶级夺取政权之前，它必须首先击溃敌对阶级的意识形态，并传播它本阶级的意识形态。因此，为了揭露和粉碎敌人的意识形态，我们必须通过宣传机器传播我们自己的意识形态。这是我们亚非作家的重要任务。
