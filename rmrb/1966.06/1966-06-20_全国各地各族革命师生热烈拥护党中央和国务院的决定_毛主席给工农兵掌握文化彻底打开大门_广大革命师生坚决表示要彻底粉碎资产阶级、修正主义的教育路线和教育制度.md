    Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students of all nationalities throughout the country continue to warmly hail the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on reforming the methods of enrollment and examination for institutions of higher learning, and enthusiastically endorse the revolutionary initiative of the students of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Beijing No. 4 Middle School.
    According to reports from East China, Central South China, Southwest China, Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China, when this exciting news reached universities and middle schools in these regions, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, especially the children of workers and peasants, immediately erupted in cheers, with shouts of "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and revolutionary songs resounding everywhere. For two days, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students of all nationalities have held discussions late into the night, written big-character posters, and sent letters and telegrams to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. With unparalleled revolutionary passion, they have expressed to the Party that they will resolutely listen to the words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and, like the revolutionary comrades in Beijing, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to break through, and dare to revolt, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly smash the bourgeois and revisionist education line and education system, and vow to be revolutionary successors of the proletariat.
    In recent days, students from major universities and middle schools in Nanning City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have been elated, posting big-character posters and holding discussions, unanimously expressing their warm support for the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Luo Guiyi (Zhuang nationality), a student from the middle school department of Guangxi Institute for Nationalities, told reporters: "The decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council is a great joyous event for the children of poor and lower-middle peasants of our minority nationalities. Before liberation, my family for three generations had never attended school. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I was able to enter school. However, the teachers want us to bury ourselves in books, detached from politics. According to their methods, we take notes in class, copy notes after class, memorize notes before exams, recite notes when answering questions, and forget everything after the exam. This education system does not guide us to serve the people but takes us down the opposite path. This education system completely violates the wishes of us working people and must be thoroughly smashed." Students of Nanning No. 10 Middle School said excitedly: Seventy percent of the students in our school are children of workers and peasants. The past bourgeois education system harmed us greatly! Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have spoken for us workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, expressing our wishes. A thousand words cannot express our love for Chairman Mao, and a thousand words cannot express our support for the new education system. We will definitely use all our energy to crush all old education systems serving the bourgeoisie and feudal class with overwhelming force. The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Meng County in Henan Province, filled with revolutionary passion, have held meetings and written big-character posters, warmly supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Students of Senior Class 3 of Meng County No. 1 Middle School wrote on a big-character poster: This wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council is a head-on blow to the bourgeois "authorities," a well-aimed blow. We successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we believe in Mao Zedong Thought the most. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and we must thoroughly destroy the old education system that opposes Mao Zedong Thought. More than one thousand revolutionary teachers and students from Changsha No. 1 Middle School in Hunan held a meeting on the evening of the 17th to celebrate the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Peng Duixi, a graduating senior, Communist Party member, said at the meeting: The continuation of the old imperial examination system for thousands of years has been destroyed, the breeding ground for revisionism has been destroyed, and Mao Zedong Thought has completely liberated us. A brand-new revolutionary road of intellectuals combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers is unfolding before us. We are revolutionary youths from Chairman Mao's hometown and ask the Party to send us to the most difficult places to closely integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements, obtain the red graduation certificate issued by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    Liu Zhizhong, Qian Xiaofang, Wang Xiaoping, and Lu Yanping, graduating high school students from Chongqing No. 1 Middle School, children of workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary soldiers, said: The old enrollment and examination system does not put proletarian politics in command, but puts bourgeois politics in command and puts grades in command. The children of workers, peasants, and soldiers are excluded from the school gates. In this way, many students are encouraged to bury themselves in books to get into college, even seriously affecting their health. This is encouraging our youth to take the "white and expert" road of bourgeois individual struggle and pursuit of fame and profit, which is contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. We will never allow the old enrollment and examination system to poison our youth again. We must start from this breakthrough of reforming the current enrollment and examination system, bravely advance, and smash the entire old education system to pieces. The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students in Kunming enthusiastically support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The enlarged meeting of student council leaders of secondary schools in the city, convened by the Kunming Student Federation, sent a telegram of respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on behalf of more than 30,000 revolutionary middle school students in the city. They vowed: We will always listen to the Party's words, always make revolution, never change our red hearts, and never weaken our fighting spirit. Revolutionary teachers and students of the Kunming part-work, part-study Panlong Middle School held a meeting, and many revolutionary students, based on their own experiences of part-work, part-study, cheered that the Party Central Committee's reform of the education system was correct, wise, and fully reflected the wishes of revolutionary young students. In Guiyang, revolutionary students have posted thousands of big-character posters supporting the decision. Children from worker-peasant backgrounds are especially happy about this decision. They said with great joy: This is a world-shaking event. We must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, return to the workers and peasants, and receive ideological graduation certificates. Revolutionary teachers and parents of students also sincerely support this wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
    All teachers and students of Lhasa Middle School and Tibet Normal School held a conference and unanimously passed a telegram to the Party Central Committee and the most beloved leader Chairman Mao. They said: We unanimously support this wise and correct decision. The words of the Party Central Committee speak to the hearts of the emancipated serf children in Tibet. Losang Quzha, secretary of the graduating senior class of the high school, a group member who came from a poor serf family on the banks of the Jinsha River, said: In the past, we Tibetan serfs not only had no opportunity to learn to read and write, but we didn’t even have the right to speak. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao did my son of a serf go to school. However, class enemies are not reconciled to death and use the old examination system as a weapon, vainly attempting to exercise dictatorship over our children of emancipated serfs. We firmly disagree. Our children of emancipated serfs have the Party and Chairman Mao to support us. No matter how "powerful" the bourgeoisie and feudal classes are, we will definitely overthrow them all.
    In Changchun, a scene of jubilation unfolded in ten universities and dozens of middle schools. The teachers and students of Changchun No. 11 Middle School, which is linked to Changchun First Automobile Works and implements part-work, part-study, were extremely excited after hearing the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Xie Zaili, daughter of a veteran of the Long March, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a graduating high school student, said excitedly that the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council opened the door for us to further contact the workers and peasants. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, adhere to part-work and part-study, learn well from the workers, and train ourselves into proletarian revolutionary successors who are both red and expert.
    Twenty students from Harbin No. 4 Middle School, who are about to go to the agricultural front line, said in a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: "On the eve of going to the agricultural front line, we heard the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and we shed tears of excitement. We swear to the Party and Chairman Mao that we will always listen to your words and always follow you. Finally, we propose to the Party and Chairman Mao that June 13 be designated as 'China Revolutionary Student Day.'"
    Students from Anshan No. 26 Middle School in Liaoning Province, after hearing the news on the radio, sent big-character posters to the Anshan Daily late at night in the rain, expressing their warm support for the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and swore to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: In this great socialist cultural revolution, resolutely be proletarian revolutionaries, destroy all old education systems, sweep away all monsters and demons, and swear to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought, defend the Party Central Committee, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.
    Students from Jixian Middle School and Yangcun Middle School in Hebei, who were harvesting wheat in the countryside, immediately held discussions on the threshing ground after hearing this decision, and told the poor and lower-middle peasant commune members about the news. The poor and lower-middle peasants said very excitedly: The decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is really on our hearts. Father and mother are dear, but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are dearer. This reform of the enrollment examination method has truly opened the door for workers, peasants, and soldiers to master culture. Only Chairman Mao can care about us like this.
    Revolutionary teachers and students from Taiyuan No. 3 Middle School, from the practice of piloting education reform for a year, deeply realized that the old college entrance examination method is a major stumbling block to the development of proletarian education. In their letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they said: We fully support this wise decision. This is a major measure to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois education system and establish a brand-new proletarian education system, and it is a revolutionary measure to fundamentally prevent revisionism from appearing in our country. After hearing the broadcast, the students of Senior Class 27 of Taiyuan No. 10 Middle School immediately composed a song and sang it. The song sang: "Chairman Mao's brilliance shines all over the world, the Party's decision spreads in all directions, hundreds of millions of young people cheer together: Long live Chairman Mao, long live the Communist Party..."
    Revolutionary students of all nationalities in schools at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region unanimously expressed their warm support for the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in different languages such as Mongolian, Chinese, and Daur. After hearing the news, the students of Senior Class 3 of No. 16 Middle School in Hohhot, where Mongolian students make up the majority, held Mao Zedong Quotations in their hands and said with tears of excitement that Chairman Mao, although in Beijing, has thoroughly understood the hearts of every revolutionary student. Late at night, they sent a telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, expressing that they will always, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, always, always follow the Communist Party, always, always make revolution, and vow to be revolutionary successors of the proletariat.
    In the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, the broad masses of teachers and students hailed this new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the education front. Liu Huashan, a student at Yan'an Middle School, the son of Liu Qiyi, who was awarded the title of bayonet hero in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said: Our revolutionary predecessors shed their heads and shed their blood and managed to build a socialist country, but some of our education departments are controlled by a small group of bourgeois royalists, who tried their best to exclude our children of workers and peasants from universities. This is something we will never allow. We are proletarian revolutionary successors, and we must take over the revolutionary class well. We will never allow the bourgeois "authorities" to poison and restrain us with the new imperial examination system. We must listen to the Party's words, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and remove all the bourgeois black gangs in the education sector.
    Revolutionary teachers and students from schools in Lanzhou, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan and other places have written and telegraphed to the Gansu Daily and Gansu People's Broadcasting Station, expressing their firm support for the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Revolutionary students from graduating high school classes in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Cooperative Middle School, Gansu Normal University Affiliated Middle School and other schools said: We must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and go to the countryside and factories with full enthusiasm, and unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. We must resolutely take over the red banner of the proletarian revolution and carry it to the end!
    Earlier, the graduating high school students of Yinchuan No. 2 Middle School received mimeographed copies of the letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao from Class 4, Senior Class 3 of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School. After the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council was announced, the students were greatly encouraged and expressed their determination to the Party. Communist Youth League member Jiang Chongying said: "All the graduates of our school were admitted according to their scores. Among the eighty-seven students, only seventeen were from worker-peasant families and children of revolutionary cadres." She asked: The working people of our country account for the vast majority of the national population, so why can only so few of their children attend school? The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council timely and thoroughly shattered the evil attempts of these bourgeois rightists and greatly enhanced the morale of the revolutionary masses.
    Revolutionary teachers and students of Qinghai No. 2 Normal School firmly stated that they would restudy Chairman Mao's instructions on education work, and, in accordance with the proletarian education policy, review and reform the school's academic system, examination system, promotion and retention system, and teaching material content. They would treat Chairman Mao's works as the most important course and the most fundamental teaching material.
    All the revolutionary teachers and students of Urumqi High School, including seven ethnic groups of Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tajik, Hui, and Han, were excited after hearing the broadcast and automatically held a celebration meeting, unanimously expressing their firm support for this wise decision of the Party and the government. At the meeting, eighteen students and five teachers spoke. Everyone believed that this was a good start to a thorough revolution on the education front. In the past, there were only improvements, and various frameworks of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism could not be eliminated. Now, this is a real revolution.
    All the revolutionary students of Senior Class 3 of Nanjing No. 10 Middle School expressed their determination to the Party and Chairman Mao on a big-character poster: Everything we have belongs to the Party and belongs to the people. We must follow your instructions, resolutely integrate with the workers and peasants, and resolutely go to the furnace of the three great revolutionary movements to temper ourselves. We sharpen our swords and armor and have made all preparations, just waiting for your order, and we will charge into battle and rush to the place where the Party needs us. If it is a mountain of knives, we dare to climb it; if it is a sea of fire, we dare to brave it. We will resolutely listen to your words, vow to be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and contribute everything, even our lives, to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution! After hearing the broadcast, students from Hangzhou No. 3 Middle School in Zhejiang Province sent a group of representatives overnight, carrying big-character posters, running more than ten miles to the newspaper office. They and students from other middle schools who arrived one after another excitedly stated: This decision is the greatest concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for our young generation. We will vow to defend the education line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and carry out a thorough revolution of the entire old education system.
    The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students in secondary schools in various parts of Shandong enthusiastically support the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to reform the methods of enrollment and examination for institutions of higher learning. After hearing the news on the radio, revolutionary teachers and students from the Affiliated Middle School of Shandong Normal College in Jinan could not help but jump and cheer. They said: This wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council is like a thunderbolt in the spring, smashing the bourgeoisie's dream and thoroughly abolishing the old examination system that has continued for thousands of years, pointing out a thorough revolutionary road for young students in our country.
    After hearing the broadcast, graduating students from Hefei No. 1 Middle School in Anhui Province sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao overnight. Wan Dengbin, secretary of the group branch of Class 2, Senior Class 3, and the son of an old worker, delivered the telegram to the post and telecommunications bureau. Because there were too many telegrams to Beijing that night, he waited until 3 am before returning to school after the telegram was sent. Wan Tingshun, the student's parent and old worker, excitedly said: Chairman Mao always thinks of us workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, and cares for our children. We must follow you and let our descendants follow you to make revolution forever. On the evening of the 17th, teachers and students of Nanchang City and various schools in Jiangxi gathered around radios and loudspeakers to listen to this important decision. Yang Dali and six other students from Nanchang No. 2 Middle School, whose school site is located at the old site of the "August 1" Uprising, and the children of revolutionary veterans, wrote a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao overnight to express their determination: "Please rest assured, Party and Chairman Mao, we have not forgotten the sufferings our parents have suffered in the past. Today, there are still two-thirds of the suffering people in the world, and we often remember them. We are determined to learn from our parents, inherit their revolutionary spirit, thoroughly destroy the stubborn fortresses of the bourgeoisie, and resolutely carry the cultural revolution in the education sector through to the end. We will never stop until we win a complete victory." Braving the heavy rain, teachers and students in Fuzhou went to the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, beating gongs and drums, to express their firm support for the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    全国各地各族革命师生热烈拥护党中央和国务院的决定
    毛主席给工农兵掌握文化彻底打开大门
    广大革命师生坚决表示要彻底粉碎资产阶级、修正主义的教育路线和教育制度
    据新华社十九日讯　全国各地各族广大革命师生继续热烈欢呼中共中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定，热情赞同北京第一女中和北京第四中学学生的革命倡议。
    据来自华东、中南、西南、东北、华北、西北各地的报道，当这个激动人心的消息传到这些地区的大中学校时，广大革命师生，特别是广大工农子女立刻发出一片欢呼，到处是“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号声和革命歌声。两天以来，各地各族广大革命师生连夜举行座谈，写大字报，向党中央和毛主席写信，打电报。他们以无比高昂的革命激情向党表示：一定要坚决听党中央和毛主席的话，象北京的革命同学那样，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底粉碎资产阶级、修正主义的教育路线和教育制度，誓做无产阶级的革命接班人。
    连日来，广西壮族自治区南宁市各大中学校学生欢欣鼓舞，纷纷张贴大字报，开座谈会，一致表示热烈拥护党中央和国务院的英明决定。广西民族学院中学部学生罗贵义（壮族）对记者说：“党中央和国务院的决定，是我们少数民族贫下中农子女的一件大喜事。解放前，我一家祖宗三代没有读过书。解放后，在党和毛主席的领导下，我才进了学校。可是老师们又要我们死钻书堆，脱离政治。按照他们这种办法，我们上课时记笔记，下课后抄笔记，考试前背笔记，答题时默笔记，考试完成也就全部忘记了。这种教育制度不是引导我们去为人民服务而是走相反的道路。这种教育制度完全违背我们劳动人民的心愿，一定要彻底打碎。”南宁市第十中学的学生们激动地说：我们学校百分之七十的学生是工农子弟，过去的资产阶级教育制度害得我们好苦！今天，党中央、毛主席为我们工人、贫农下中农子弟说了话，表达了我们的心愿。千言万语也不能表达我们对毛主席的热爱，千言万语也说不完我们对新的教育制度的拥护。我们一定用全部精力，以摧枯拉朽之势，粉碎一切为资产阶级、封建阶级服务的旧教育制度。河南省郑州、洛阳、开封等市和孟县的广大革命师生，满怀革命激情，纷纷举行集会，写大字报，热烈拥护党中央和国务院的决定。孟县一中高三班学生在大字报上写道：党中央和国务院这一英明决定，给资产阶级“权威”老爷们当头一棒，这一棒打得好。我们无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的，我们最听毛主席的话，最信仰毛泽东思想，我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一定要把对抗毛泽东思想的旧的教育制度彻底摧毁。湖南长沙市第一中学一千多名革命师生，十七日晚上举行集会，庆祝党中央和国务院的英明决定。这个学校高三毕业班学生、共产党员彭对喜在大会上说：几千年旧科举制度的延续被摧毁了，产生修正主义的温床被摧毁了，毛泽东思想把我们彻底解放了，一条崭新的知识分子同工农兵群众相结合的革命大道展现在我们眼前。我们是毛主席家乡的革命青年，要求党把我们派到最艰苦的地方去，和工农兵紧密结合，积极投入到三大革命运动中去，取得工农兵发给的红色毕业证书，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
