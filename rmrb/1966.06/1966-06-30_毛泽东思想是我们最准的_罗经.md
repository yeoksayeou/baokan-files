    Mao Zedong Thought is Our Most Accurate "Compass"
    Captains of a Certain Submarine Unit of the Navy: Shí Tiāndìng, Cuī Fújùn, Wú Jiāxī, Tán Zhuānshù

    Currently, people have two completely different attitudes towards Mao Zedong Thought. We workers, peasants, and soldiers hold Mao Zedong Thought in the highest regard, using the most beautiful and glorious language to praise Mao Zedong Thought. All the ghosts and snakes, both international and domestic, hate Mao Zedong Thought the most, using the most shameless and vicious language to attack Mao Zedong Thought.

    However, truth is unyielding to slander. Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in our minds. You gentlemen of the bourgeoisie, listen carefully to how we sailors praise Mao Zedong Thought!

    Our engine room personnel say: Mao Zedong Thought is our greatest "power." It drives the Chinese revolution and the world revolution forward at the fastest speed.

    Our navigators say: Mao Zedong Thought is our most accurate "compass." The direction it points to is the most accurate, and the path it leads us on is the straightest!

    Our radar operators say: Mao Zedong Thought is our "all-purpose radar." Its "waves" shine light on the world, exposing ghosts and snakes in their true forms.

    Our signalmen say: Mao Zedong Thought is our best "telescope." It sees far, distinguishes clearly, and makes enemy ships and pirate ships unable to move an inch.

    Our gunners say: Mao Zedong Thought is our most precise "sight." It aims at all enemies with the greatest precision and hits them the hardest!

    This is the genuine praise from the depths of our hearts.

    All true knowledge comes from practice, and our praise comes from personal experience. The August 6th Naval Battle and the Chongwu Naval Battle are the most convincing facts. The victories in these two naval battles are completely victories of Mao Zedong Thought. When we summarized the experience of these naval victories, we all had the following deep feelings:

    It is Mao Zedong Thought that makes us deeply rooted in class hatred.

    Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." He also said: "Our army has always had two principles: First, be ruthless towards the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." We followed Chairman Mao's instructions. Through bitter-sweet remembrance education and situation education, we greatly aroused the class hatred of the troops, understanding for whom we are soldiers and for whom we fight. Combat hero Mai Xiande wrote in his notes on studying Chairman Mao's works: "One shot to take down Huang Shiren, two shots to take down Chiang Kai-shek, three shots to take down the American devil, four shots to take down all the running dogs." Such a magnificent spirit and clear class stance is the result of his active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, making him a steel soldier. The new soldier of the "Sea Pioneer Boat," Qian Konghua, is also a sailor born in the old society and grown under the red flag. He has only been on the boat for a few months, but he fights like a little tiger. He is short and can't reach the firing panel, so he uses a life jacket to pad himself on the gun position to shoot. As soon as he sees the enemy, he is filled with deep hatred for the old society. The first shot didn't hit, so he quickly adjusted and hit every time afterwards, making the enemy ship burst into flames.

    It is Mao Zedong Thought that makes us stand tall with revolutionary ideals.

    Chairman Mao said: "Communists will never abandon their socialist and communist ideals. They will go through the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution to reach the stage of socialism and communism." Comrade Lin Biao emphasized: "Achieving socialism and communism is the lofty ideal for which our military personnel have long fought bravely." Our naval soldiers are firmly doing just that. We are on the ships but have our hearts in the country and eyes on the world. We regard the overthrow of the "three big mountains" as completing the first step of the Long March. We always remember that there are still two-thirds of the people in the world who are not liberated. Service is limited, but revolution is unlimited. Becoming a "volunteer for communism" has become our sailors' oath. Supporting world revolution is our duty. During the Chongwu Naval Battle, our cook Guo Zhongliang took the initiative to carry out the ammunition delivery task. While delivering the shells, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and he fell many times, with his body covered in bruises, but he said: "Doing revolution, we fear no sacrifice. For the world's people, falling a few times is nothing. I am happy to see the enemy ship hit." Our soldiers responded to Chairman Mao's call to "serve all the people of China and the world."

    It is Mao Zedong Thought that makes us proficient in tactics and techniques.

    We studied Chairman Mao's instructions on strategy and tactics and learned to fight in battles. In the naval battle east of Chongwu, the captain of a certain boat, Tan Zhuanshu, who was awarded a collective first-class merit, said: "When we approached the enemy ship 'Yongchang,' it fired 'bravery shells' from afar. I thought: You fire your shells, and I drive my boat. I won't fire unless I get close, and I will hit you once I get close. The enemy ship saw that the 'bravery shells' were ineffective and tried another trick: every time we were about to get close, it changed direction multiple times to try to escape. At this time, we adopted flexible and mobile tactics of 'enemy changes, I change,' finally catching the enemy ship and launching a fierce attack, quickly sending the 'Yongchang' to the bottom of the sea."

    It is Mao Zedong Thought that makes our fighting spirit unyielding.

    In our anti-enemy struggle on the coastal defense front, we deeply felt that we must maintain a high degree of combat vigilance against the sabotage of American imperialism and all reactionaries. The enemy is sharpening their knives, and we must also sharpen ours. Doing revolution means cultivating a spirit of not fearing hardship or death. The captain of Mai Xiande's boat, Cui Fujun, who was awarded a first-class merit in the August 6th Naval Battle, said: "After new soldiers board the boat, we cultivate their spirit of hardship and perseverance in their work, life, and actual struggles, bit by bit. These new soldiers consciously fight against the wind and waves, fight against difficulties, and fight against all 'enemies' that hinder their willpower. The more they fight, the redder their thoughts become, the harder their style becomes, and the more proficient their skills become." In the naval battle east of Chongwu, every soldier was like an iron tiger, and everyone was a spiritual atomic bomb, daring to fight any fierce battle and daring to fight any strong enemy. A comrade's finger was blown off by an enemy shell, leaving only a little skin connecting it. He, in order not to affect the operation, gritted his teeth and tore off his not completely severed finger, continuing to fight. This heroic act of withstanding and attacking is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

    Our two naval battles have once again proven a truth: soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless, bravest, smartest, and strongest. Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is the source of our invincibility and unmatched strength.

    Gentlemen of the bourgeoisie, you curse our active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism." In essence, you are opposing us from treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive, fearing that we will grasp Mao Zedong Thought and carry out a thorough revolution against you bourgeois "authorities" and ghosts and snakes, pulling you down from your thrones.

    We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of being proficient is entirely for application." We will forever carry out Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "Study with questions in mind, actively learn and apply, integrate learning and use, learn urgently what is needed immediately, and see results quickly." We revolutionary soldiers can eat less food and sleep less, but we cannot study Chairman Mao's works less. We can give up our lives and shed our blood, but we cannot abandon Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our mortal enemy. We will fight them like we fought the "Zhanjiang," "Jianmen," and "Yongchang," loading full ammunition, running at full speed, aiming at the enemy ships, and blowing them up, making them sink to the bottom of the sea and perish completely!

### 毛泽东思想是我们最准的“罗经”

    毛泽东思想是我们最准的“罗经”
    海军某部艇长　石天定　崔福俊　吴加溪　谈遵树
    当前，人们对待毛泽东思想有两种截然不同的态度：我们工农兵最崇敬毛泽东思想，用最美好、最光辉的语言来歌颂毛泽东思想。国际和国内的一切牛鬼蛇神最仇恨毛泽东思想，用最无耻、最恶毒的语言来攻击毛泽东思想。
    但是，真理是永远骂不倒的。毛泽东思想已在我们头脑里牢牢地扎下根子。资产阶级“权威”老爷们，你们支起耳朵，好好听听我们水兵是怎样歌颂毛泽东思想的吧！
    我们的轮机兵说：毛泽东思想是我们最大的“动力”。推动着中国革命和世界革命以最大的速度向前进。
    我们的航海兵说：毛泽东思想是我们最准的“罗经”。指示的航向最准，领着走的航道最直！
    我们的雷达兵说：毛泽东思想是我们的“万能雷达”。“电波”光芒射世界，牛鬼蛇神现原形。
    我们的信号兵说：毛泽东思想是我们最好的“望远镜”。看得远，辨得明，黑船、贼船，寸步难行。
    我们的枪炮兵说：毛泽东思想是我们最精确的“瞄准具”。对一切敌人瞄得最准，打得最狠！
    这就是我们水兵发自内心的颂歌。
    一切真知来自实践，我们的颂歌来自切身体验。“八·六”海战和崇武海战就是最有说服力的事实。这两次海战的胜利，完全是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们在总结海战胜利经验时，都有这样的深切体会：
    是毛泽东思想，使我们把阶级仇恨扎得深深的
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”又说：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”我们就是按照毛主席这个指示做的。我们通过忆苦思甜教育和形势教育，大大激发了部队的阶级仇恨，懂得了为谁当兵，为谁打仗。战斗英雄麦贤得在学习毛主席著作的笔记中写道：“一枪撂倒黄世仁，二枪撂倒蒋光头，三枪撂倒美国鬼，四枪撂倒众走狗。”这样豪迈的气概，鲜明的阶级立场，就是他活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是使他成为一个钢铁战士的根本。“海上先锋艇”新战士邝孔华，也是一个生在旧社会、长在红旗下的水兵，他上艇才几个月，打起仗来却象一个小老虎。人矮，够不上击发板，他用救生衣垫在炮位上打。他一见敌人，就激起了对旧社会的刻骨仇恨。第一次点射没打中，他咬着牙迅速修正，以后次次命中，打得敌舰直冒烈火。
    是毛泽东思想，使我们把革命理想立得高高的
    毛主席说：“共产党人决不抛弃其社会主义和共产主义的理想，他们将经过资产阶级民主革命的阶段而达到社会主义和共产主义的阶段。”林彪同志又强调地说：“实现社会主义和共产主义，是我军指战员长期以来为之英勇奋斗的崇高理想。”我们海军战士就是坚定不移地这样做的。我们身在舰艇，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。我们把推翻了“三座大山”看成是万里长征走完了第一步。我们时刻记住，世界上还有三分之二未解放的人民。服役有限，革命无限。做“共产主义义务兵”已成了我们水兵的誓言。支援世界革命是我们应尽的义务。崇武海战中，我们的炊事兵郭忠良，主动担任了运弹任务。在运送炮弹时，风大浪高，摔了不少跤，身上青一块紫一块，但他说：“干革命牺牲都不怕，为世界人民摔几跤有什么关系，我看到打中敌舰就高兴了。”我们的战士就是这样响应了毛主席的“为全中国人民和全世界人民服务”的号召。
    是毛泽东思想，使我们把战术技术练得活活的
    我们学习了毛主席有关战略战术的指示，在打仗中学习打仗。在崇武以东海战中荣立集体一等功的某艇艇长谈遵树说：“我们向敌舰‘永昌号’接近时，敌舰老远就放‘壮胆炮’，我心里想：你打你的炮，我驾驶我的艇，我不靠近你，我就不开炮，我靠近打你，你就跑不了。敌舰一看‘壮胆炮’不起作用，又耍第二个花招：每当我们快靠近它时，它就多次改变方向，企图逃跑。这时我们又采取敌变我变的灵活机动的战术，终于抓住敌舰，进行了猛烈轰击，使‘永昌号’很快葬身海底。”
    是毛泽东思想，使我们把战斗意志磨得硬硬的
    我们在海防前线的对敌斗争中，深深地体会到，对美帝国主义和一切反动派的捣乱，必须保持高度的战斗警惕。敌人在磨刀，我们也要磨刀。干革命就要树立不怕苦、不怕死的硬骨头精神。麦贤得所在艇的艇长、“八·六”海战荣立一等战功的崔福俊说：“新战士上艇后，我们就从工作中、生活上和实际斗争中，一点一滴地培养他们的硬骨头精神，这些新战士自觉地跟风浪斗，跟困难斗，向一切妨碍自己锻炼意志的‘敌人’斗，越斗，思想就越红，作风就越硬，技术就越精。”崇武以东海战中，战士个个都是铁打的老虎，人人都是一颗精神原子弹，什么恶仗都敢打，什么强敌都敢拚。一个同志的一个手指被敌人炮弹打断了，只剩一点皮连着。他为了不影响操作，咬咬牙，狠狠心，就把自己未全断的手指撕下来，继续投入战斗。这种顶得住、攻得上的英雄行为，就是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    我们两次海战的实践，又一次证明了一条真理，那就是：用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士最无私，最勇敢，最聪明，最坚强，活学活用毛主席著作，就是我们战无不胜攻无不克的力量源泉。
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们，你们破口大骂我们活学活用毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”，说穿了，无非是反对我们把毛主席的书当作最高指示，怕我们掌握了毛泽东思想，对你们这些资产阶级“权威”和牛鬼蛇神实行彻底革命，把你们从宝座上拉下来。
    我们永远记住了毛主席的教导：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我们永远执行林彪同志的指示：“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”，“特别要在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。我们革命战士，饭可以少吃，觉可以少睡，毛主席著作不能少学。我们命可舍，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的死敌，我们就要象打“章江号”、“剑门号”、“永昌号”那样，装满炮弹，开足马力，对准贼船，打它一个屁股朝天，让它葬身海底，彻底完蛋！
