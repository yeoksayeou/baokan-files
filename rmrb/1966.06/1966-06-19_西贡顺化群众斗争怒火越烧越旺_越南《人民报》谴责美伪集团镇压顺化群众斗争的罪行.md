    Saigon and Hue Masses' Struggle Flames Higher and Higher
    *People's Daily* Condemns the Crimes of the U.S.-Puppet Clique in Suppressing the Hue Masses' Struggle
    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 18th) The struggle of the masses and Buddhists in Saigon, Hue and other cities in South Vietnam against the U.S.-puppet clique is continuing to develop. Although the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique, with the support of its American masters, is carrying out brutal suppression of the masses, the flames of mass struggle are burning higher and higher.
    According to Western news agencies, youths and Buddhists in Saigon have held successive demonstrations against the U.S.-puppet clique since the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, a procession of about three thousand youths and Buddhists marched toward the U.S. "Embassy," shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "Down with Johnson!" "Down with the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky Clique!" The U.S.-puppet clique dispatched a large number of military police, throwing dozens of tear gas canisters and firing over a hundred shots at the demonstrating masses. A sixteen-year-old student was shot and wounded, dying the next day, and eight others were wounded. The angry masses fought back against the military police and burned a U.S. military jeep and a puppet police jeep.
    The next day, students at Saigon Medical College also held a rally on campus to strongly condemn the American aggressors. The U.S.-puppet clique dispatched troops and secret agents to surround the school and stormed the meeting, arresting nearly a hundred students on the spot. While the puppet military police were arresting people, many students fought with the puppet police and sang patriotic songs.
    On the 17th, the demonstrating masses broke through the encirclement of the puppet military police and marched to the center of Saigon. A thirteen-year-old boy was shot and killed on the spot by the puppet police. Enraged, the demonstrating masses immediately resisted, setting fire to four vehicles, including a U.S. military jeep and a puppet police jeep.
    In Hue, the struggle of Buddhists and the masses against the U.S.-puppet clique has been continuous. In order to suppress the struggle of the masses in Hue, on the 16th and 17th, the Nguyen Cao Ky group successively transferred two battalions of paratroopers, about one thousand men, from the Phu Bai military base to Hue. The Saigon puppet regime announced that military rule would be imposed on Hue starting from the 17th. However, the facts have already shown that the suppression by the U.S.-puppet clique is like adding fuel to the fire, and can only arouse greater anger among the masses in the U.S.-puppet-controlled areas, accelerating the demise of its precarious puppet little court.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th) The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published a commentary on the 18th, strongly condemning the crimes of the U.S.-puppet clique in dispatching a large number of military police to barbarously suppress the struggle of the masses in Hue, South Vietnam. The commentary stated that the people of North Vietnam welcome and support the just struggle of the people of Hue and other cities in the South against the U.S.-puppet clique.
    The commentary said that the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group, under the instructions of their American masters, dispatched troops to launch a frenzied suppression of the masses in Da Nang, and then launched an offensive to encircle and isolate Hue, cutting off all supplies to the people of Hue and causing many difficulties for the people of Hue in terms of economy and livelihood. The commentary pointed out that despite this, the flames of the people of Hue's struggle against the American aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group are burning even more vigorously. The commentary said that the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky group has sent troops to Da Nang for nearly a month, but the masses of Da Nang are still resisting them. Sending troops to Hue can only make the people of Hue and various opposing forces more determined to oppose them.

    西贡顺化群众斗争怒火越烧越旺
    越南《人民报》谴责美伪集团镇压顺化群众斗争的罪行
    据新华社十八日讯　西贡消息：南越西贡和顺化等城市的群众和佛教徒，反对美伪集团的斗争正在继续发展。尽管阮高其傀儡集团在它的美国主子支持下，对群众进行残暴的镇压，但群众斗争的怒火越烧越旺。
    据西方通讯社报道，西贡市的青年和佛教徒从十三日以来，接连举行反对美伪集团的示威游行。十四日早晨，约三千名青年和佛教徒的游行队伍，朝美国“大使馆”进发，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒约翰逊！”“打倒阮文绍—阮高其集团”等口号。美伪集团出动大批军警，向示威群众投掷了数十枚催泪瓦斯弹，开了一百多枪。一名十六岁的学生中弹受伤于次日死亡，另八人被打伤。愤怒的群众和军警展开搏斗，并烧毁了一辆美军吉普车和一辆伪警察的吉普车。
    第二天，西贡医学院的学生也在校园里举行集会，强烈谴责美国侵略者。美伪集团出动军队和特务包围了学校，冲进会场，当场逮捕了近一百名学生。在伪军警捕人时，许多学生和伪警察扭打，并且高唱爱国歌曲。
    十七日，示威群众又冲破伪军警的包围，到西贡市中心游行。一名十三岁的少年当场被伪警察开枪杀害。被激怒了的示威群众立即反抗，放火烧毁四辆汽车，其中有一辆美军吉普车和一辆伪警察吉普车。
    在顺化市，佛教徒和群众反对美伪集团的斗争一直持续不断。为了镇压顺化群众的斗争，十六日和十七日，阮高其集团接连从芙拜军事基地调了两营伞兵约一千人到顺化。西贡伪政权宣布，从十七日起对顺化实行军事统治。但是，事实已经表明，美伪集团的镇压，犹如火上加油，只能激起美伪统治区群众的更大的愤怒，使它朝不保夕的傀儡小朝廷，加速走向覆灭。
    据新华社河内十八日电　越南《人民报》十八日发表评论，强烈谴责美伪集团派遣大批军警野蛮镇压南越顺化市群众斗争的罪行。评论表示，越南北方人民欢迎和支持顺化和南方各城市人民反对美伪集团的正义斗争。
    评论说，阮文绍—阮高其集团在他们的美国主子的指使下派兵对岘港群众进行疯狂镇压之后，又对顺化展开了一个包围和孤立的攻势，切断了对顺化人民的一切供应，在经济和生活上给顺化人民造成许多困难。评论指出，虽然这样，但顺化人民反对美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团的斗争烈火却燃烧得更加旺盛。评论说，阮文绍—阮高其集团派兵进驻岘港将近一个月，但是岘港的群众仍然同他们相对抗。他们派兵进驻顺化，也只能使顺化人民和各种对立派力量更加坚决地反对他们。
