    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 31st -- Sithole, the representative of the Mozambican Revolutionary Committee stationed in Cairo, told Xinhua News Agency reporters in Cairo on May 31st about his impressions of his recent visit to China, saying: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light of the world revolution. Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of all progressive oppressed people in the world."

    Sithole said: "If the people in struggle want to achieve victory in the revolution against imperialism, they should study Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to the actual conditions of their own country."

    Mahlouza, the military secretary of the Mozambican Revolutionary Committee, who had also visited China, participated in the conversation and expressed his complete agreement with Sithole's views.

    Recalling his visit to China, Sithole said: "The Chinese people are very aware of the struggles of the African people, including the people of Mozambique. We were warmly welcomed everywhere. The Chinese people fully support our struggle."

    In the conversation, Sithole pointed out that the Chinese and African people had shared similar experiences and faced a common enemy. There is a close militant friendship between the Chinese people and the African people, including the people of Mozambique. He said: "We are fighting a common enemy, imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States."

    Sithole emphasized that the most important thing is that the Chinese people "are people taught by Chairman Mao. They understand that their own liberation is incomplete without liberating all mankind. Therefore, their hearts are always with the oppressed people."

    He said: "Our friendship is based on mutual support and respect, that is, on equality. It is not like the modern revisionists, who are always boasting about their so-called support, but in fact, they are controlling our struggle and making our struggle subservient to their interests."

    Talking about China's construction achievements, Sithole said: "The Chinese people apply Mao Zedong Thought and his principle of self-reliance in practice. Therefore, they have achieved great accomplishments."

    "These achievements were achieved by the Chinese people relying on themselves after the withdrawal of Soviet experts. Any country that wants true independence and progress should adhere to the principle of self-reliance."

    Recalling his visit to Yan'an, Sithole said that an old farmer enthusiastically told him about Chairman Mao's life and revolutionary activities in Yan'an. He said that he personally saw that "the entire Chinese people love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always with the people."

    Sithole concluded: "After returning from our visit to Yan'an, the holy land of world revolution, we have greater courage and are full of confidence in our struggle. We want to express our gratitude to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong."

    莫三鼻给革命委员会代表西托尔盛赞中国人民热爱毛主席
    毛主席是世界被压迫人民伟大领袖
    毛泽东思想是世界革命的指路明灯
    新华社开罗电　莫三鼻给革命委员会驻开罗代表西托尔五月三十一日在开罗对新华社记者谈他最近访问中国的观感时说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命的指路明灯。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界一切进步的被压迫人民的伟大领袖。”
    西托尔说：“如果斗争中的人民要在反对帝国主义的革命中取得胜利，他们就应该学习毛泽东思想，并把毛泽东思想运用于自己国家的实际。”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会军事书记马赫卢扎也参加了这次谈话，他也访问过中国，他表示完全同意西托尔的意见。
    西托尔回忆他在中国访问的情况时说：“中国人民非常了解非洲人民包括我们莫三鼻给人民的斗争。我们到处受到热烈欢迎。中国人民完全支持我们的斗争。”
    西托尔在谈话中指出中国人民和非洲人民有过共同的遭遇，同时，面临着共同的敌人，中国人民和包括莫三鼻给人民在内的非洲人民之间存在着亲密的战斗友谊。他说：“我们正在同共同的敌人，以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义作斗争。”
    西托尔强调说：最重要的是中国人民“是毛主席教导下的人民，他们懂得，不解放全人类，他们自己的解放是不彻底的，因此他们的心总是向着被压迫的人民。”
    他说：“我们的友谊是建立在相互支持和尊重的基础上的，也就是建立在平等的基础上的。不象现代修正主义者那样，他们老是吹嘘他们所谓的支持，事实上他们干的是控制我们的斗争，使我们的斗争服从于他们的利益。”
    西托尔谈到中国建设成就时说：“中国人民在实践中运用毛泽东思想和他的自力更生的原则。因此，他们取得了伟大成就。”
  “这些成就都是中国人民在苏联专家撤走后依靠自己取得的。任何国家想要真正独立和进步，就应该奉行自力更生的原则。”
    西托尔回想起在延安访问时，一个老农热情地向他讲述毛主席在延安时的生活和革命活动的情况，他说，他亲眼看到，“全体中国人民热爱毛主席。毛主席永远跟人民在一起”。
    西托尔最后说：“在我们访问世界革命的圣地延安归来以后，我们对自己的斗争有了更大的勇气和充满了信心。我们要向中国人民、中国共产党和毛泽东主席表示感谢。”
