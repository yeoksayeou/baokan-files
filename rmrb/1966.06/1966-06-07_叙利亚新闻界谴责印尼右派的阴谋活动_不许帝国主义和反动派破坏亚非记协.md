    According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus – Syrian journalists have expressed that they will absolutely not allow a “Voice of America” broadcaster to impersonate the “Secretary-General” of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association to carry out sabotage activities.
    Saber Falhout, Director of the News Department of the Syrian Ministry of Information, told Xinhua News Agency that anti-imperialist Syria will defend the progressive Afro-Asian Journalists Association. He said that we know that Djawoto is the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association. Arifin Bey cannot represent the Afro-Asian Journalists Association.
    Syrian journalists stated that they will not allow imperialists and reactionaries to undermine the Afro-Asian Journalists Association. They said that the Afro-Asian Journalists Association is an international organization including fifty-three member countries. Therefore, Indonesia has no right to interfere in its affairs or appoint its Secretary-General. They expressed that they would absolutely not allow a "Voice of America" broadcaster to impersonate the "Secretary-General" of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association to carry out sabotage activities in Syria. It is reported that Arifin Bey, supported by imperialists and reactionaries, is currently active in some Asian countries in an attempt to undermine the unity of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association and its member countries, and turn the association into a tool of imperialists and reactionaries.

    不许帝国主义和反动派破坏亚非记协
    据新华社大马士革电　叙利亚新闻界人士纷纷表示决不容许一个“美国之音”广播员冒充亚非新闻工作者协会“总书记”进行破坏活动。
    叙利亚新闻部新闻司司长萨贝勒·法尔胡特对新华社记者说，反帝的叙利亚要保卫进步的亚非新闻工作者协会。他说，我们知道查禾多是亚非新闻工作者协会的总书记。阿里芬·贝不能代表亚非新闻工作者协会。
    叙利亚新闻工作者们表示，他们不容许帝国主义者和反动派破坏亚非新闻工作者协会。他们说，亚非新闻工作者协会是一个包括五十三个会员国的国际组织。因此，印度尼西亚没有权利干涉它的事务或任命它的总书记。他们表示决不容许一个“美国之音”广播员冒充亚非新闻工作者协会“总书记”在叙利亚进行破坏活动。据报道，受帝国主义和反动派支持的阿里芬·贝目前正在一些亚洲国家活动，企图破坏亚非新闻工作者协会及其会员国的团结，把这个协会变成帝国主义和反动派的工具。
