Title: Make the Jackals, Wolves, Tigers, and Leopards Suffer Crushing Blows

    Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army is a great army that is invincible and always victorious. In decades of revolutionary war, what "powerful" enemies have we not competed with, and what "powerful" enemies have not been trampled under our feet! However, the People's Liberation Army depicted in *Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles* is so incapable even against surrendered prisoners of war. May I ask, if our People's Liberation Army were as depicted by the director and screenwriter, how could we have eliminated eight million American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the three-year Liberation War? How could we have fought alongside the Korean People's Army to defeat American imperialism in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea? Facts are the best testimony, and our army's glorious history cannot be distorted by anyone.
    The director and screenwriter of *Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles* beautify the enemy and slander our army. This is blatantly clearing the way for the enemy's counter-revolutionary restoration. However, any enemy, whether they fall from the sky, emerge from the ground, or crawl out of the sea; whether they are jackals in the house or tigers and leopards outside the wall, whoever wants to oppose the Party and oppose socialism is throwing themselves into a trap and will suffer crushing blows.
    We revolutionary fighters must not only firmly grasp the guns in our hands, ready at any time to eliminate the enemy, but also take up our pens and actively participate in this socialist cultural revolution. We must never allow the enemy to use the weapon of literature and art to attack our Party and our army.

    让豺狼虎豹碰得头破血流
    在毛主席的正确领导下，人民解放军是一支攻无不克、战无不胜的伟大的军队。几十年的革命战争，什么“强大”的敌人没有较量过，什么“强大”的敌人不被我们踩在脚下！可是，《逆风千里》中所描写的解放军，竟对缴械投降的俘虏，这等无能。试问，我们解放军如果象编导者所描写的那样，怎么能在三年解放战争中消灭八百万美式装备的蒋匪军呢？在抗美援朝战争中，又怎能和朝鲜人民军并肩打败美帝国主义呢？事实是最好的见证，我军的光辉历史是任何人都歪曲不了的。
    《逆风千里》的编导者美化敌人，污蔑我军，这是明目张胆地替敌人的反革命复辟鸣锣开道。可是，任何敌人，无论是从天上掉下来，从地上冒出来，还是从海里爬上来；无论是屋里的豺狼，还是墙外的虎豹，谁要想反党反社会主义，都是自投罗网，都会碰得头破血流。
    我们革命战士，不仅要紧紧握住手中的枪杆子，时刻准备消灭敌人，而且也要拿起笔杆子，积极参加这场社会主义文化大革命。决不容许敌人利用文艺的武器向我党我军进攻。
