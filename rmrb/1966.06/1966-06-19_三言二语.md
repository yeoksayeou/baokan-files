    Brief Comments
    Lying to One's Face
    Before leaving Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk said, "I find that American foreign policy objectives are widely understood, respected, and supported." Rusk's uttering of such a black-and-white reversal made even the American bourgeois newspapers unable to resist scoffing. The *Washington Evening Star*, for example, pointed out, "It certainly exposes the government's current ability to deceive itself."
    Rusk's lying to one's face is clearly intended to deceive others. As for self-deception, that is also a fact. Because Johnson, Rusk, and their ilk are more aware than anyone else that the United States' current situation is extremely isolated. The U.S.'s setback at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Brussels meeting once again proves this point.
    Absurd to the Extreme
    Rusk said in a recent speech: "No one desires peace more than the President of the United States. No one is more reluctant than he is to order young people to fight (in South Vietnam)." Johnson's warmongering has long been notorious. People of all countries have unanimously condemned him as a butcher. Rusk actually praised him for "desiring peace," which is truly shameless in the extreme.
    Rusk's saying that Johnson is "reluctant to order young people to fight" is even more absurd. Under Johnson's "reluctance," more than 200,000 American youths have already been sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield to serve as cannon fodder. If Johnson becomes "willing," how many more American youths will be forced to their deaths?

    三言二语
    当面撒谎
    美国国务卿腊斯克在离开布鲁塞尔之前说：“我发现美国外交政策目标受到广泛的了解、尊重和支持”。腊斯克说出这种颠倒黑白的鬼话来，连美国资产阶级报纸都不能不嗤之以鼻。《华盛顿明星晚报》就指出：“它的确暴露了政府目前自欺欺人的本领。”
    腊斯克当面撒谎，旨在欺人，这是显而易见的。至于自欺，也是事实。因为约翰逊、腊斯克之流比谁都更清楚美国目前的处境十分孤立。美国在北大西洋集团布鲁塞尔会议遭到挫败，也再一次证明了这一点。
    荒唐之至
    腊斯克在最近一次演讲中说：“没有人比美国总统更渴望和平。没有人比他更不乐意命令青年去（南越）作战了”。约翰逊的好战，早已臭名远扬。各国人民都异口同声谴责他是刽子手。腊斯克居然吹捧他“渴望和平”，真是无耻之尤。
    腊斯克说什么约翰逊“不乐意命令青年去作战”，更是荒唐之至。在约翰逊“不乐意”的情况下，已经有二十多万美国青年被送到南越战场上去当炮灰，如果约翰逊“乐意”起来，将要有多少美国青年被迫去送命呢？
