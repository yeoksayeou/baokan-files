	Chenghuan, head of the Cambodian delegation, reported today at the emergency meeting of the Asian-African Writers' Conference that at present, the people of the world support the Vietnamese brothers who are on the frontline of the anti-American struggle. This is the responsibility of every man and woman with a sense of justice. For Asian-African writers, it is our duty to make the people of all countries in the world understand the various crimes committed by American imperialism and the significance of our struggle to maintain independence and get rid of foreign rule. Chenghuan spoke about how Cambodia, under the wise leadership of Prince Sihanouk, has severed diplomatic relations with the United States, refused the dollar, and clearly stated its solidarity with Vietnam, which is currently engaged in struggle. He said, "Cambodia has always been fearless in the face of violence and has declared full support for the completely reasonable demands of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic and the sole true representative of the people of South Vietnam—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam."

	Chenghuan pointed out that imperialism and old and new colonialism, led by the United States, have mobilized countless writers, poets, essayists, philosophers, jurists, filmmakers, and journalists to try to cover up their own crimes and boastfully and deceitfully claim that military intervention in Vietnam, the massacre of the Vietnamese people, the creation of chaos in Vietnam, subversive activities in Vietnam, and the division of Vietnam are all aimed at uniting the Vietnamese people; that the plundering of Vietnam's economy is to help Vietnam develop its economy; and that the introduction of decadent culture into Vietnam to poison the Vietnamese people and make them kill each other is to help Vietnam develop its culture. He said: "We Asian-African writers should oppose all the deceitful, slanderous, and boastful tricks of American imperialism. We all clearly know that now, the American bandits have sent a large number of troops to South Vietnam to kill the Vietnamese people. However, American imperialism puts this crime on the heads of the Vietnamese people and says that the Vietnamese people have committed crimes against Vietnam. Cambodia is the same. Every day, it is maliciously slandered by the lackeys of the United States. However, under the leadership of the honorary chairman of the Cambodian Writers' Association, Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian writers have united and bravely opposed the propaganda and deception of American imperialism."

	Chenghuan said, "We fully support the struggle against imperialist cultural aggression. Imperialist culture has destroyed our national culture and replaced it with the most decadent American civilization of murder, brutality, money madness, racism, pornography, theft, and drunkenness. We have seen this vile civilization in the capitals and many large cities of Asian countries that have been invaded by the United States. We must resist this disaster."

    柬埔寨代表团团长郑璜的报告
    新华社二十九日讯　柬埔寨代表团团长郑璜今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上说，目前，世界人民支持站在反美斗争前线的越南兄弟，这是每一个有正义感男女的责任。对于亚非作家来说，我们有责任使全世界各国人民了解美帝国主义所犯下的各种罪行和我们大家为维护独立、摆脱外国统治而进行战斗的意义。郑璜谈到了柬埔寨在西哈努克亲王的英明领导下，同美国断绝了外交关系，拒绝了美元，明确地阐明了自己同正在进行着斗争的越南的团结。他说，我们柬埔寨从来是不畏强暴，并宣布全力支持越南民主共和国和越南南方人民唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的完全合理的要求。
    郑璜指出，以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，动员了无数的作家、诗人、散文家、哲学家、法学家、电影工作者和新闻记者，试图掩盖自己的罪行，并且吹嘘和欺骗地说：对越南军事上的干涉，对越南进行的屠杀是挽救越南；在越南制造混乱，在越南进行颠覆活动和使越南分裂，是使越南人民互相团聚；掠夺越南的经济是帮助越南发展经济；把颓废的文化输入越南毒害越南人民，使越南人民互相残杀，是帮助越南发展文化。他说：我们亚非作家，应当反对美帝国主义的一切欺骗、诬蔑和吹嘘的鬼计。我们大家都清楚地知道，现在，美国强盗派遣大批的军队到南越杀害越南人民。但是，美帝国主义却把这种罪过加在越南人民头上，并说，越南人民对越南犯下了罪。柬埔寨也是如此，天天都受到美国仆从的猖狂诬蔑。但是，柬埔寨作家们，在柬埔寨作家协会名誉主席西哈努克亲王的领导下，柬埔寨作家团结起来勇敢地反对美帝国主义的这种宣传和欺骗。
    郑璜说，我们完全支持反对帝国主义文化侵略的斗争。帝国主义的文化破坏了我们的民族文化而代之以屠杀、残暴、金钱狂、种族主义、诲淫、诲盗和酗酒等最腐朽的美国文明。这种卑鄙的文明，在遭到美国侵略的亚洲国家的首都和许多大城市，我们都亲眼看到过。我们应当抵制这种灾难。
