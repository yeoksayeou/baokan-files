    Beijing and the Broad Masses of the Country Cheer the New Victory of Mao Zedong Thought
    Warmly Support the Wise Decision of the Party Central Committee to Reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee
    Unanimously believe this is a devastating blow to the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, this revisionist den, and a victory of historical significance in our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must forever remember this historical lesson and never forget class struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th—Beijing and the broad masses of people across the country, filled with revolutionary passion, are rejoicing and warmly supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and supporting the decision of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee to reorganize the Peking University Party Committee. At the same time, people are angrily denouncing the towering crimes of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee's revisionist clique against the Party and socialism.
    The masses of all circles in the capital unanimously believe that these two decisions are a devastating blow to the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, this revisionist den, and a victory of historical significance in the glorious course of our Party leading the people of the whole country in carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a new victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    Since yesterday afternoon, after the broad masses of people in Beijing heard these two pieces of news, people have been spreading the word and celebrating throughout the city. Many factories, schools, shops, institutions, Beijing-based military units and colleges, and suburban communes held rallies last night and today to celebrate this victory. Many people wrote to the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee and newspaper offices, expressing their warm support for the decision of the Party Central Committee. Some units also sent representatives, carrying big-character posters, to the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee to express their congratulations. Representatives of workers, students, and residents shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" Some people even couldn't help but sing revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red" and "Socialism is Good." Workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company carried a large banner reading "Support the Decision of the CCP Central Committee, Seize Back the Proletarian Seal of Power," and shouted slogans, warmly supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Liu Qi, foreman of No. 1 blast furnace in the iron smelting plant, said that the Party Central Committee's decision defended the socialist state and safeguarded the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully representing the will of millions of working people. Jiang Lingzhi, an advanced fine yarn spinner and activist in studying Chairman Mao's works from the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, shed tears of excitement after hearing the news. She said: This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. I must, under the leadership of the new Municipal Party Committee, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, make great efforts in the "application" aspect, do my work better and better, and carry the Great Cultural Revolution through to the end. Yin Weichen, a model agricultural laborer from Huangtugang People's Commune in the suburbs, said, please tell Chairman Mao to rest assured that we poor and lower-middle peasants will always believe in the Party, resolutely follow Chairman Mao in making revolution for the rest of our lives, and thoroughly eliminate the revisionist ideological poison of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. When student representatives from Tsinghua University went to the new Municipal Party Committee to congratulate them, they said that they were all young people around the age of twenty and were participating in such a sharp and complex class struggle for the first time. They expressed their determination to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the new Municipal Party Committee, work with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to ferret out all the monsters and demons and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    At Peking University, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students felt even more elated after hearing the news, and cheers erupted throughout the campus. Students formed celebratory teams, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, and went to places where crowds gathered on campus to collectively recite the decision of the Party Central Committee and the decision of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The students were in high spirits, raising their arms and shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"
    Today, the broad masses of people in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Nanjing, Chengdu, Changsha, Harbin, Lhasa and other cities are warmly supporting the wise decision of the Central Committee. Commanders and fighters of the troops stationed in Shanghai wrote to the newspaper, saying: The leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee implemented a revisionist line, engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, and became a bridgehead for capitalist restoration. Now, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have wisely and decisively eliminated this time bomb buried within the revolutionary camp, which is a blessing for the people of the whole country. Gesang, deputy director of the Poor Peasants Association of Dongga Township, Duilongdeqing County, who was weeding in a highland barley field in the suburbs of Lhasa, said to the Tibetan farmers beside him after hearing the news: "When weeding, you have to pull out the roots. We must also dig up the old roots of counter-revolutionaries, dig them out fiercely, and dig them out completely." Tian Jingqi, representative of the National People's Congress and deputy director of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, warned a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, saying: Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight them to the death and completely defeat them. In this life-and-death class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our working class must not only hold tight the knife handle in production, but also hold tight the knife handle in ideology, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sweeping away all monsters and demons. Representatives of all ethnic groups attending the Northwest Region Financial and Trade Work Conference in Xi'an emphasized that this victory is a great happy event for the people of the whole country and also a great happy event for the revolutionary people of the world. They said that the issue of the seal of power is a fundamental issue of the revolution. The fact that the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee was controlled by some revisionists for a long time fully demonstrates the seriousness, complexity, and sharpness of class struggle in socialist society. We must forever remember this historical lesson and never forget class struggle.

    北京和全国广大群众欢呼毛泽东思想的新胜利
    热烈拥护党中央关于改组北京市委的英明决定
    一致认为这是对前北京市委这个修正主义老巢的毁灭性打击，是我国无产阶级文化大革命中一个有历史意义的胜利。我们要永远记住这个历史教训，永远不忘阶级斗争。
    新华社四日讯　北京和全国各地广大群众满怀革命激情，欢欣鼓舞，热烈拥护党中央关于改组北京市委的决定，拥护新的北京市委关于改组北京大学党委的决定。同时，人们愤怒声讨前北京市委一伙修正主义分子反党反社会主义的滔天罪行。
    首都的各界群众一致认为，这两个决定，是对前北京市委这个修正主义老巢的毁灭性打击，是我们党在领导全国人民进行无产阶级文化大革命的光辉历程中一个具有历史意义的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    从昨天下午北京广大群众听到这两个消息以后，人们就奔走相告，举城欢庆。许多工厂、学校、商店、机关、驻京部队各院校和郊区公社，在昨天晚上和今天纷纷举行集会，欢庆这一胜利。许多人投书新的北京市委和报社，表示热烈拥护党中央的决定。有的单位并且派出了代表，携带大字报，前往新的北京市委表示祝贺。工人、学生和居民的代表在这里高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”有的人并且情不自禁地高唱《东方红》和《社会主义好》等革命歌曲。石景山钢铁公司的工人们抬着“拥护中共中央决定，夺回无产阶级印把子”的大幅标语，高呼口号，热烈拥护党中央改组北京市委的决定。炼铁厂—高炉工长刘琦说，党中央的这个决定，保卫了社会主义江山，保卫了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，完全代表了千百万劳动人民的意志。北京第二棉纺织厂先进细纱挡车工、学习毛主席著作积极分子姜灵芝，听到这个消息后，激动得流下了眼泪，她说：这是毛泽东思想的胜利。我一定要在新市委的领导下，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把工作做得好上加好，把文化大革命进行到底。郊区黄土岗人民公社农业劳动模范殷维臣说，请转告毛主席，让他老人家放心，我们贫下中农永远相信党，坚决跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，彻底肃清前北京市委的修正主义思想毒害。清华大学的学生代表到新的市委去祝贺时谈到，他们都是二十岁左右的青年，是第一次参加这样尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。他们表示一定要更紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，在新市委的领导下，同工农兵一道，把一切牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在北京大学，广大革命师生听到这个消息后，更加扬眉吐气，全校发出一片欢呼。学生们组成报喜队，举着毛主席象，到校园内人群聚集的地方，集体朗诵党中央的决定和北京新市委的决定。学生们情绪激昂，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    今天，上海、天津、广州、沈阳、西安、南京、成都、长沙、哈尔滨、拉萨等城市的广大人民，都热烈拥护中央的英明决定。驻上海部队指战员在写给报社的信中说：前北京市委的领导执行修正主义路线，搞反党反社会主义勾当，成了资本主义复辟的桥头堡，现在，党中央和毛主席英明果断地清除了埋藏在革命阵营内部的这个定时炸弹，是全国人民的幸福。正在拉萨市郊青稞地里锄草的堆龙德庆县东嘎乡贫协副主任格桑听到消息以后，对身旁的藏族农民说：“锄草要锄根，对待反革命分子也要挖它的老根，狠狠地挖，一定要挖干挖净。”全国人民代表大会代表、成都量具刃具厂副厂长田景琦警告一小撮反革命的修正主义分子说：毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，谁敢反对毛泽东思想，我们就要同他决战，彻底把他打垮。在无产阶级文化大革命这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，我们工人阶级既要握紧生产上的刀把子，还要握紧思想上的刀把子，以毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，参加无产阶级文化大革命，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。正在西安出席西北地区财贸工作会议的各民族代表着重指出，这个胜利是全国人民的一件大喜事，也是全世界革命人民的一件大喜事。他们说，印把子问题是革命的根本问题，前北京市委长期被一些修正主义分子所把持，这充分说明社会主义社会中阶级斗争的严重性、复杂性和尖锐性，我们要永远记住这个历史教训，永远不忘阶级斗争。
