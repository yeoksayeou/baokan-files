Foreword

Since a new editor-in-chief took over the journal *Historical Research* from the first issue of 1961, it has gradually become a position for bourgeois representatives to oppose the Party and socialism in the field of history.

Under the guise of academic discussion, this journal, with a prominent position and a large amount of space, published many reactionary articles that were anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Marxist-Leninist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought on a series of principled issues, such as the direction of historical studies, the issue of peasant wars, the issue of class viewpoints and historicism, and the issue of evaluating historical figures, and released a large amount of poisonous weeds. Since the criticism of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* began, they first greatly reduced the number of pages to resist this struggle. Recently, they suddenly reversed their behavior, pretending to be active, changed from a bimonthly to a monthly publication, and published a large number of "critical" articles.

The third issue of *Historical Research* published on May 15, 1966, published the editorial department's *Annotations on the Correspondence between Wu Han and Hu Shi*. According to the editor's note: "We must thoroughly expose anti-revolutionary elements like Wu Han from all aspects and resolutely carry out this struggle that concerns the fate of the Party and the country to the end." At first glance, it seems that they are going to make a revolution this time, and it seems that they are going to thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against Wu Han. But these are deceptive lies!

If the editorial department of *Historical Research* disagrees with this assertion, then we want to ask: Since Wu Han is a "hidden anti-revolutionary element," since this struggle "concerns the fate of the Party and the country," as the person in charge of *Historical Research* and the Institute of Modern History, why have you not made public this batch of materials hidden in the institute for a long time? Why did you make things difficult when many units borrowed this batch of materials more than a month ago? Why did you rush to publish this batch of materials only when the counter-revolutionary history of Wu Han, the vanguard of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party group, has become clear?

Obviously, you are publishing this batch of materials because you are forced by the situation; it is to cover up your own bourgeois position of shielding Wu Han's crimes and to whitewash yourselves.

You are forced to publish this batch of materials, playing a trick of false struggle and real protection. You continue to provide cover for Wu Han through so-called "annotations." You say that these letters "illustrate" that Wu Han was following the "bourgeois road of seeking fame and fortune"; that Wu Han "only sought advice from Hu Shi on academic matters" for a considerable period of time; that Wu Han had "a little bit of faint national consciousness" after the September 18th Incident; and that Wu Han "has unconditionally accepted Hu Shi's pragmatism since 1930" and that "he has been following this path for thirty years." According to your statement, Wu Han only followed Hu Shi academically, and did not become a loyal lackey of the foreign slave Hu Shi, did not fully accept Hu Shi's anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary mantle, and did not follow Hu Shi on the counter-revolutionary road. What is this called "thoroughly exposing Wu Han"? What is this called "resolutely" "struggling"?

As long as people use class viewpoints to analyze these letters, it is not difficult to see that the relationship between Wu Han and Hu Shi is not only an academic relationship, but also a reactionary political relationship; Wu Han's path for thirty years is not only a path of pragmatism, but also an anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary road.

You have another extremely despicable purpose in publishing this batch of materials, that is, to secretly launch cold arrows at some revolutionaries who are actively criticizing Wu Han. You attack those you call "people who want to become famous overnight in twenty-four hours" by falsely criticizing Wu Han's "first history, then theory." People know that Wu Han's "first history, then theory" is to "study more problems and talk less about doctrines," specifically, Hu Shi's so-called "being down-to-earth everywhere," "working diligently," "reading the *History of the Ming Dynasty* carefully," and diving into the piles of historical materials. What does this have to do with "some people who want to become famous overnight in twenty-four hours"? You forcibly link these two completely opposite things together, which is not just a confusion of logic, but obviously you have other intentions. Who exactly are you directing your spear at? In our opinion, it can only be directed at the comrades who are actively participating in the socialist cultural revolution today.

Since you dare to do this, people have reason to ask: What kind of relationship do you have with Wu Han and his gang?

Below, we also add annotations to this batch of letters, and ask readers to compare them with the editorial department's annotations of *Historical Research* and draw their own conclusions.

Wu Han to Hu Shi (March 19, 1930) Dear Mr. Shizhi:

Last year, I did a "Index of Place Names in the Study of Southeast Asian Countries in Ancient Chinese Books," which was preliminary work material for studying Southeast Asian countries. It is an analysis of books related to Southeast Asia in the Twenty-Four Histories, unofficial histories, Tang and Song dynasty notes and novels, etc., compiled into an index. When school started this year, I found a few more books and prepared to reorganize it.

Last week, when I was sorting out the *Record of Buddhist Kingdoms*, I suddenly became interested in studying Faxian. There are a few points in it:

1. The *Record of Buddhist Kingdoms* calls Central India China (referring to themselves as Qin or Han people).

a. "The country of Udyana is North India; they all speak the language of Central India. Central India is what is called China; the clothes and food of the common people are also the same as in China."

b. "...South from here is called China. China has moderate heat and cold, and no frost or snow..."

c. "Among all the countries in China, the city of this country is the largest."

d. "China has moderate heat and cold; trees can be thousands or even ten thousand years old."

e. "Faxian set off from Chang'an for six years, stayed in China for six years, and returned for three years."

2. Contradictory years for the journey: According to the record, Faxian set off from Chang'an in the second year of Hongshi and returned after fifteen years, so the year of his return should be the ninth year of Yixi (413 A.D.). According to *Biographies of Eminent Monks*, Faxian set off in the third year of Long'an (399 A.D., i.e., the second year of Hongshi of the Later Qin dynasty) and returned after fifteen years, so the year of his return should also be the ninth year of Yixi. However, according to the *Record of Buddhist Kingdoms*, "belonging to the Liu family," the year of return should be after Liu Yu usurped the Jin dynasty. According to the postscript, "This year is Jia Yin, the twelfth year of Yixi of the Jin dynasty," which not only does not match the meaning of fifteen years for the journey, but also Jia Yin is the tenth year of Yixi, and the twelfth year of Yixi is Bing Chen (416 A.D.), which is also different. Also, according to *Sui Shu: Treatise on Scriptures* "Faxian traveled from Chang'an to India, passing through more than thirty countries. Wherever there were sutras and precepts, he learned their books and languages, translated and wrote them down. When he returned to Jinling, he discussed and finalized them with the Indian Zen master Bala, saying that they were transmitted by scholars of the Sanghika Vinaya," there is also no clear year to be found.

The first point is just a motive to arouse research interest. If I can find corroborating evidence in the future, I may be able to overthrow the definitions of the word "China" by several predecessors; regarding the year issue in the second point, I am now preparing to do a study or research on Faxian's *Record of Buddhist Kingdoms*, with the following table of contents:

I. Brief Biography of Faxian
        a. Chronology
        b. Historical Background (based on *Sui Shu: Treatise on Scriptures*)
        c. Background of the Times (based on *History of the Northern and Southern Dynasties*, *Book of Jin*)
        d. Later Influence
II. Examination of the Year of Faxian's Journey to the West to Seek Dharma
        a. Modern Interpretation of Place Names
        b. Table of Years Visited on the Journey to the West
III. Achievements of the Journey to the West to Seek Dharma and Chinese Buddhism
IV. The Relationship between Southeast Asian Countries and China during the Faxian Era
V. Map of Faxian's Journey to the West to Seek Dharma by Land and Water

The year of Faxian's departure is no longer a problem, as for the year of return, there is a very powerful piece of evidence in:

*Record of Buddhist Kingdoms*: "Among the monks there was a great virtuous śrāmaṇa named Dharmaguptika... In the Mahavihara monastery there was a virtuous śrāmaṇa... The people of the country all suspected that he was an arhat... When Faxian arrived, he did not see him alive, but only saw his burial..."

If I can find the dates of birth, death, and burial of Dharmaguptika and the virtuous śrāmaṇa, then the year problem of Faxian's return should not be difficult to solve. Because you are currently studying Buddhist historical materials, I am raising my questions and writing to you, and hoping that you will give me the following assistance within the possible range:

1. Facts about Dharmaguptika and this virtuous śrāmaṇa (birth, death, and burial);
2. Borrowing or guidance on the materials necessary for studying Faxian (such as the *Biographies of Eminent Monks* and other books);
3. I can only base my work on a *Record of Buddhist Kingdoms* in the *Han-Wei Congshu*, the edition is very bad. I would like to find a better edition, punctuate and proofread it; also, I would like to proofread the *Great Tang Records on the Western Regions* and the *A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago*, and bind them together or publish them. This would provide many conveniences for researchers. Is this suggestion feasible? If so, can you provide me with the necessary books or borrow them for me?

I know that you are very busy now, but other than you, I really can't think of anyone who can solve and guide the path using scientific methods better than you. I hope you can take a few minutes to give me a reply.

Student Wu Chunhan (Wu Han's original name) March 19

Annotation: Why did Hu Shi develop a strong interest in Buddhist history from 1924 to 1934? He explained it very clearly himself: "Zen monks used to say, 'Bodhidharma came to the East, just to find someone who is not deceived by others.' What I say here in thousands of words is just to teach people a method that is not deceived by others. Being led by the nose by Confucius and Zhu Xi is certainly not clever; being led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin is not a good hero either." (*Introducing My Own Thought*) Hu Shi attempted to beg the spirits of Bodhidharma and others to resist the spread of Marxism and serve imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek. Wu Han knew that Hu Shi "was studying Buddhist historical materials" and rushed to cater to his preferences in order to gain advancement.

Hu Shi peddled "a little scientific spirit, a little scientific attitude, and a little scientific method" of pragmatism to the "young friends" at the time. (*Introducing My Own Thought*) Wu Han then offered him flattery: "Other than you, I really can't think of anyone who can solve and guide the path using scientific methods better than you." This means that Wu Han was willingly requesting Hu Shi to lead him by the nose and embark on the "path" of anti-communism, anti-people, and counter-revolution.

Wu Han to Hu Shi (June 29, 1930) Dear Mr. Shizhi:

Volume 4, P. 174 of the second collection of *Hu Shi's Collected Essays*, "Postscript to Textual Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber," has the following point:

"(3) Cao Xueqin's son died first. Xueqin was saddened by illness and died soon after. Based on this, it seems that Xueqin had no descendants after his death." A few months ago, when I was doing "Queen Mother of the West and Mount Kunlun," I flipped through a lot of books, among which there was a Qing Dynasty book, *Miscellaneous Records of the North Dong Garden* by Liang Gongchen (Dao Guang Gui Mao 1843 A.D.), which mentioned this matter. I copied it down at the time, preparing to ask you when you came to Zhong Gong, but I never had the chance. Today, when I was rereading *Hu Shi's Collected Essays*, I saw this point again. I hurriedly went to find the copy I made before to compare, but I forgot where I had clipped it. Now I will describe the main idea mentioned in Liang's book as follows:

...The author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, Cao Xueqin, was indeed a real person. Cao was an old tribute student who only had the lament of Bo Dao! After his death, he was desolate and neglected... The above text is what a Manchu friend told him about the badness of *Dream of the Red Chamber* for being lewd, and the following text seems to contain the meaning of "retribution." From this point, we can see that:

a. The attitude of the intellectual class towards *Dream of the Red Chamber* around 1843.
b. People at that time already knew that *Dream of the Red Chamber* was written by Cao Xueqin.
c. Cao Xueqin was an old tribute student.
d. Had no son.
e. Was desolate and neglected after his death.

Cao died in 1764, only seventy or eighty years away from the completion of *Miscellaneous Records of the North Dong Garden*, and the Manchu conversation recorded in this article does not necessarily have to be the year the book was completed, and should be earlier than the completion of the book. So I think Liang's statement is relatively credible and can prove that your research is correct. However, items c and d seem to have problems, what do you think?

Student Wu Chunhan June, 29.

Also, I am going to transfer to Yanjing University in Beiping to study in the History Department in the second half of the year. I would like to ask you to write a letter of introduction, I wonder if that is possible?

Wu Han to Hu Shi (× Month, 28, 1930) Dear Mr. Shizhi:

Page thirty-seven of your *Textual Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber* uses the poems of the Duncheng brothers to determine Cao Xueqin's time of birth and death—born around 1715-1720, died around the thirtieth year of Qianlong, around 1765—this is an extremely precise conclusion, but your words are only assumptions, and there is no strong contemporary evidence.

In recent days, I found some materials in the *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio* that can confirm this issue, and I have specially copied them and presented them to you.

Part of Yongzhong's *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio*—*Zhi Xue Bian* (Revised Edition), I wrote a postscript for it two months ago. Recently, the Yanjing University Library successively purchased all of Yongzhong's handwritten *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio*, about twenty-seven volumes. These manuscripts are chronological and have great historical value. There is a passage in volume fifteen:

"The thirty-third year of Qianlong, Wu Zi (Yongzhong) was thirty-four years old...

"Because of ink fragrance, I got to see the novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* and wrote three quatrains to mourn Xueqin (surnamed Cao):

"The vivid writing is enough for thousands of years, only lovers shed tears. It's a pity we didn't know each other at the same time,

How many times have I closed the book and cried for Cao Hou.

Pin Pin and Baoyu are deeply in love, laughing and talking privately in the girls' boudoir. The three-inch soft pen can write everything, I want to call the talented ghost to be the first.

Everything comes to my eyes and mind, the talented man works hard to search. Chaos was opened with seven orifices at once, how can heaven not give poverty and sorrow."

There is a commentary on the cover: "Ink Fragrance said: 'These three poems are extremely wonderful, but *Dream of the Red Chamber* is not a novel for the ages. I have heard of it for a long time. I don't want to see it after all, for fear of offensive words in it.'"

The cover of this booklet says: "Recorded on June 7th, Bing Shen (1776)." (Other volumes also have dates.) This poem was written by Yongzhong when he was thirty-four years old. Xueqin had already died when he wrote the poem. The poem is titled mourning, or Xueqin died in this year (1768) or earlier? This is only three years different from what you assumed. In short, Xueqin's death was before 1768, which can be determined from this. From these three poems and commentary, at least the following facts can be deduced:

(1) Yongzhong got to read *Dream of the Red Chamber* from Ink Fragrance. Yongzhong and Xueqin were contemporaries but did not know each other. Because he read *Dream of the Red Chamber*, he heard the bad news (?) and wrote a poem to mourn him.

(2) Ink Fragrance may have a relationship with Xueqin. Historical materials about Xueqin may be found in Ink Fragrance's works. (Ink Fragrance is yet to be investigated, and I may be able to report back in a few days.)

(3) There are offensive words (?) in *Dream of the Red Chamber*—so Ink Fragrance, although "I have heard of it for a long time, I don't want to see it after all"—not a novel for the ages. The so-called offensive words are a euphemism added to events between men and women by false moralists under the old etiquette at that time. Because it has these things, it cannot be a novel for the ages. This can represent the opinion of the scholar-official class on *Dream of the Red Chamber* before 1768. Conversely, its popularity after 1768 is also enough to see the change in the world. Most of the reason can be attributed to the changes in the court and social life, and the promotion of the scholar-official class.

(4) Poem two lists Baoyu and Pin Pin together, naturally referring to the first eighty chapters. Your assumption that "Cao Xueqin died before the book was finished" (page fifty-three of *Preface to Dream of the Red Chamber*) seems to be debatable. Because in 1768 or a little earlier, Yongzhong was able to read *Dream of the Red Chamber*, it can be seen that it was not unfinished. In 1768, Ink Fragrance had "heard of it for a long time," so it can be seen that it was not completed around 1768. According to this, the book was completed five to ten years before 1768. I think this can be said in two ways: (1) Around 1760, Cao Xueqin had already written it as a complete book, and the ending was a tragedy. Daiyu, Xiangyun, Fengjie, and Xiangling all have endings. What Yongzhong read was this version, so there is the sentence "only lovers shed tears." (2) Gao continued or threw away a part after eighty chapters and added his own to make a one hundred and twenty chapter version. Taking a step back, even if it was unfinished, the whole book had already been predetermined to have a tragic ending, but it was not that Xueqin died before the book was finished, but that the unfinished book was completed seven or eight years before Xueqin's death. There may have been a carved version at that time (?) Otherwise, Xueqin's death should be moved forward seven or eight years, around 1760.

(5) Xueqin's life in his later years was poor and miserable.

According to *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio: Records of Elders and Worthies* Arts and Literature Nine *Biography of Zongshi Wenzhao: Complete Table of Zongshi Wanggong Hereditary Chapters and Officials' Ranks* Under Emperor Shengzu: Yongzhong, styled Liangfu, with the sobriquet Quxian, also known as Quxian, self-styled Master of Yanfen Studio, also known as Recluse Ruanhuan, Taoist Jiuhua, Master Jingxuan. Grandson of Prince Xunqin of Duo Luo, second son of Beile Hongming of Duo Luo Gongqin, awarded the title of Third-Class Assistant General of the State in Qianlong Bingzi (1756). Born in the thirteenth year of Yongzheng Yi Mao, died in May of the fifty-eighth year of Qianlong (1735-1793), at the age of fifty-nine. He had friendships with Duncheng, Dunmin, Dunxian... *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio* has about seven or eight hundred poems and some prose, which contain some poems given to them.

The above is because I first wrote the postscript for *Zhi Xue Bian* in *Manuscripts of Yanfen Studio*. In recent days, I reread your textual research and saw that there were places quoting Yongzhong, so I began to pay attention to this broken manuscript and found these things. I was extremely happy and immediately wrote to tell you.

According to the content of this book, there must be poems about Cao Xueqin in it. I will look for it carefully tomorrow. (Because the paper is old, I can only flip through it slowly) Or there may be other discoveries, which is also unknown.

Is there any need to re-examine the birth and death deeds of Duncheng and his generation? If you want, I can copy all the poems that Yongzhong gave to them. It is also possible to find out the birth and death dates.

Ming Chen Wenzhu's *Collection of Essays from Eryou Garden* has Lu of Mianyang's *Legacy Books of the First Worthies of Hubei*, which has been purchased by the library. I heard about it incidentally, and I respectfully wish you good health

Student Wu Chunhan Late on the twenty-eighth

Annotation: Hu Shi's "research" on *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a specimen of comprador culture. "Mr. Shizhi" made "bold assumptions," and "student Wu Chunhan" hurriedly made "careful proofs."

On May 4th Youth Day in 1962, Wu Han shamelessly recommended his "experience" to young people in his speech *Several Issues on Studying History*: "The stage of copying books is very important. You must be diligent with your eyes and hands, otherwise you will suffer losses. I often suffer this loss." Reading this letter, we can know: Wu Han's so-called "eye diligence" is to accurately spot the master's preferences. The so-called "hand diligence" is to diligently copy books, offer materials, and diligently write letters to express loyalty. The so-called "suffering losses" is regretting missing a material that can be used as a stepping stone. Wu Han's entire set of "experience" is this kind of sycophantic path to advancement.

Wu Han recently denied: He kept silent when the criticism of Hu Shi was caused by the criticism of *Dream of the Red Chamber Studies* in 1954 and 1955 because he participated in government work, was busy with official duties, and did not have a single book by Hu Shi on hand. This letter exposes Wu Han's lies. It turns out that Wu Han back then was a minor character of Hu Shi's "Redology" school. It seems that he was unwilling to betray his teacher's teachings not without reason.

Wu Han to Hu Shi (May 5, 1931) Dear Mr. Shizhi:

Two months ago, I found Wu Zhiqi's *Biography of Hu Yinglin* in *Wushu*. The author's era was slightly later than Hu's. In this biography, it is said that Hu's year of death was Ren Yin in the thirtieth year of Wanli (1562), and his age was fifty-two. This can solve the problem of Yinglin's year of death mentioned by Mr. Gu Jiegang in the *Preface to Sibu Zhenge*. (In the preface, he inferred that his age was over sixty based on Jiang Zhanran's words.) Coincidentally, a copy of *Complete Collection of Shaoshi Shanfang* and *Manuscripts of Yanzhou Sibu* were borrowed from the Yanjing University Library a few days ago, and it took nearly half a month to collect the events of Hu's life from the two books. In addition, I flipped through some collections of poems and prose and local chronicles of Hu's contemporaries, as well as books such as *Ming Shi Zong*, *Jin Hua Yi Wen Zhi*, and *Quan Zhe Shi Hua*, and *Tai Han Ji*, *Collection of Poems from Eryou Garden* and other books collected in the Zhonghai Library, and drafted a *Chronology of Hu Yinglin* of nearly thirty to forty thousand words.

It seems that Hu's deeds have not been paid attention to before the publication of the collated version of *Sibu Zhenge*. Some people who attacked him only attacked his dependence on Wang Shizhen (*History of Ming: Biography of Literary Figures*), or Qian Muzhai, who specialized in attacking his *Shi Sou*, and Shen Defu and the officials of the Siku, who nitpicked and criticized his occasional mistakes. Conversely, those who spoke well for him, such as Zhu Yizun, only used the four words "seed of reading" in a vague way. As for his deeds, it seems that no one has ever paid attention to them. Even if there are, they are absurd and not worth relying on.

Now I have sorted all the materials I can find under each year. Except for the contradictory places, I don't participate in any opinions myself. The self-prefaces of his important works are also copied down because they can explain the purpose and views of the book. The citation of materials is mainly based on Yinglin's own writing, supplemented by other references. For example, Wang Shizhen's *Biography of Hu Yuanrui* is an increase or decrease from Yinglin's own *Biography of Shiyang Sheng*, and *Biography of Hu Guan Cha* is based on *Description of My Father's Experience*. In this way, except for the differences in Wang's writing, it is entirely based on Hu's, occasionally using both biographies together.

He was a child of the Ming Dynasty's heavy spirit of fame, establishing societies and flaunting everywhere, a product of the empty and shallow era. He himself was a figure in the Chang'an Society and the Baiyu Society. The most prosperous period of the so-called former and later Seven Masters in the fifty years before his birth had a great impact on his life. I plan to divide the chronology into three sections: (1) From the first year of Zhengde to the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing, the period of the Seven Masters movement. (2) From the thirtieth year of Jiajing to the thirtieth year of Wanli, Yinglin's chronology. (3) From the thirty-first year of Wanli to the present (A) Chronology of published editions of Yinglin's works (B) Criticism of Yinglin by predecessors.

I don't know if this approach is right? Please take some time and give me more advice. The books I have referenced are very limited, and I hope you can introduce some others to me.

Because I have not talked to you directly, I would like to introduce myself: I was a student who entered the China Public School in 1929. After you left Zhong Gong last year, I immediately came to Beiping to transfer to Yanjing University. Unexpectedly, Yanjing did not allow me to enroll after I arrived in Beiping, because my English grade in Zhong Gong was C, although they had sent an enrollment permit when I transferred. Later, Mr. Jiegang introduced me to work in the Chinese-Japanese Compilation and Examination Department of the Yanjing University Library. Now I want to transfer to the History Department of Peking University in the second half of the year, because I am afraid of repeating last year's mistakes, I resigned from my job at Yanjing University, and I was preparing for my lessons first, so I now have time to write this chronology.

Student Wu Chunhan May 5th

Annotation: Wu Han has the skill of flattery: first asking questions, then offering materials; seeing that the time is ripe, he immediately "introduces himself." Sure enough, God does not fail those who work hard, and the good news came the next day.

After liberation, Wu Han shamelessly defended Hu Shi, saying that Hu Shi was forced to leave China Public School because he opposed Chiang Kai-shek. And he lied: "As soon as he left, I thought it was boring to continue studying at China Public School," "I ran to Beiping in a muddle." (*I Overcame the "Super-Class" Viewpoint*) This letter shows that Wu Han tried every means to get into the service of Hu Shi, a servant of the U.S.-Chiang regime, and followed him wholeheartedly. He was completely clear about it, where was he in a muddle?

Hu Shi to Wu Han (May 6, 1931) Comrade Chunhan:

I remember you and know your work.

I was very happy to hear that you are doing *Chronology of Hu Yinglin*.

Two years ago, I inferred that Hu "died at the age of about fifty" (see page 630 of my *Collected Essays* Volume 3), but my basis was very little, just an assumption. Now I am glad that you have found the biography written by Wu Zhiqi and determined that he died in the thirtieth year of Wanli, at the age of fifty-two, which is very close to my assumption.

But you wrote "1562" under the thirtieth year of Wanli in the letter, which is a big mistake. I don't know how this error occurred. This year is 1602. The year of birth is 1551.

Your segmentation is also very good. I would like to see it when it is written. Please come and talk when you have time on Sunday. Mr. Luo Ergang lives in my house.

Hu Shi, May 6, 1920.

Annotation: This is Hu Shi's first letter to Wu Han, expressing "remembrance" and "knowledge" of Wu Han's flattering and ingratiating "work." The master issued his first commendation order to the servant and immediately summoned him. From then on, Wu Han entered the hall and became attached to the tail, becoming a counter-revolutionary "crossing-the-river pawn" under Hu Shi's command.

Wu Han to Hu Shi (× Month, 19, 1931)
[This document is missing the top]

Last winter, I had the idea of compiling an *Index of Personal Names in the Four Histories*—I thought that studying ancient history should start from the Han Dynasty and go back, but I suffered from the lack of concentrated events and could not organize them, so it was necessary to compile indexes of personal names, place names, and other indexes—now I have written forty to fifty thousand cards, proofread them two or three times (the original uses the Palace Edition, and the proof uses the Jingyou Edition and Jinling Edition of the Bai Naben) and arranged them. If I can enroll in the second half of the year, I can probably succeed by the end of the year. But there are many difficult problems. Now I will list a few major ones and ask you for guidance.

(1) The index is made for easy inspection, so the length should be as economical as possible. Now the format I have set is to refer to the *Shi Xing Yun Bian* and make it more detailed where it is omitted and omit where it is detailed. The name includes the place of origin, family (such as ○○ son, ○○ brother), style name, sobriquet, and different names, but not the official resume (only the title of nobility is listed). What is seen is only listed in the volumes of *History*, *Han*, etc., and the page and line numbers are not marked. This is not only because there is no standard version to rely on, but also because it is too complicated and may be inconvenient to use. However, some teachers and friends also think that the page and line numbers should be listed in detail. The reason is that if it is not like this, it is still inconvenient to check. However, if this is followed, in the Four Histories, people such as Han Gao, Han Wu, Guangwu, Sima, Cao, and generals and ministers each need to list dozens of hundreds of entries, and even in the same volume, there are dozens of entries. Should the page and line numbers be marked in the end? This is the first.

(2) The classification of Chinese dictionaries has always followed the *Shuowen* radicals. In recent times, the Four-Corner Code classification has also been popular for a while. Should the classification and arrangement of this index follow the old or the new? Which of the two is more convenient? This is the second.

(3) Chinese people are accustomed to using style names and sobriquets to crown the name. Those who are famous are known to everyone, but those who are unknown are easy to confuse. It is planned to attach a table of different names and a table of titles of nobility after the index. The study of genealogy was valued by people in the past. Following the source and tracing the stream can also give a glimpse of the origin of thought and social status. It is planned to attach a table of genealogy after the index. The ancient emperors (such as the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of the Three Dynasties) and listed countries (such as Qin) that are different from each other are recorded to provide reference for exploration. Also, like Liu Xiang, Qin, De, Han Xin, and Zhou Bo, there are dozens of people with the same name in the Han Dynasty. The previous records of the same name only included those with biographies and were not detailed. It is planned to attach a record of the same name after the index.

The above few points are only the major ones. In addition, issues such as the selection of women and immortals, those with names but no surnames or only one character, and the clans of the Xiongnu and Southern Barbarians are all problems. I hope you can simply point me in a clear direction!

I have inquired about the Peking University auditing student system you mentioned last time, and it is said that there is no such system now. Now I still have ways to think about English, Western history, logic, etc.—I can read English now, but I don't understand the grammar—but it is too late to cram for math. This is really a fatal blow!

Also, I want to find Qian Muzhai's criticism of Hu Yinglin. In recent days, I have flipped through the *Chuxue Ji* and *Youxue Ji* of the Sibu Congkan edition, but I can't find it. I don't know if it is in other books? Can you tell me!

Student Wu Chunhan On the nineteenth noon

Annotation: Why is it so distraught to not be able to audit at Peking University? It's very simple. Hu Shi, who was teaching at Peking University at that time, had already appeared on the political stage as an agent of American imperialism. Wu Han saw that Hu Shi was the backer who could give him "instructions" and "a clear direction" and control his destiny. Therefore, not being able to go to Peking University to be Hu Shi's follower was "really a fatal blow" to him!

Wu Han to Hu Shi (× Month, 18, 1931) Dear Mr. Shizhi:

I asked friends in my hometown to search in the surrounding counties for *Wushu*, eight volumes, but I couldn't find it. This book is not recorded in *Siku Zongmu* and *Zhejiang Caiji Yishu Zongmu*. It was only cited by Hu Jiqiao in his *Jin Hua Jing Ji Zhi* in recent times. Predecessors such

    吴晗投靠胡适的铁证
    ——一九三○年至一九三二年吴晗和胡适的来往信件
    前言
    《历史研究》从一九六一年第一期由一位新主编接手以来，逐渐成为资产阶级代表人物在史学领域内反党反社会主义的阵地。
    这个刊物，在学术讨论的幌子下，以显著的地位，大量的篇幅，在史学方向问题、农民战争问题、阶级观点与历史主义问题、历史人物评价问题等等一系列原则性问题上，发表了许多反党反社会主义和反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的反动文章，大放毒草。自《海瑞罢官》的批判展开以来，他们先是大减篇幅，抵制这场斗争。最近，他们突然一反常态，故作积极，由双月刊改为月刊，大登“批判”文章。
    五月十五日出版的一九六六年第三期《历史研究》，发表了编辑部的《评注吴晗胡适通信》。据编者按说：“我们必须从各方面彻底揭露吴晗这类暗藏的反革命分子，坚决把这场关系党和国家命运的斗争进行到底。”乍看起来，他们这一回好象是要革命了，好象是要对吴晗彻底揭露、坚决斗争了。其实这是骗人的鬼话！
    如果《历史研究》编辑部不同意这样的论断，那末我们要问：既然吴晗是“暗藏的反革命分子”，既然这场斗争“关系党和国家命运”，身为《历史研究》和近代史研究所的负责人，你们为什么长期不公布在所内藏着的这批材料？为什么一个多月以前许多单位向你们借阅这批材料的时候，你们百般刁难？为什么在“三家村”反党集团的急先锋吴晗的反革命的历史已经真相大白的时候，你们才匆匆忙忙公布这批材料？
    显然，你们公布这批材料，是为形势所迫；是为了掩盖你们自己包庇吴晗罪行的资产阶级立场，给你们自己脸上抹粉。
    你们被迫公布这批材料，玩的是假斗争、真包庇的把戏。你们通过所谓“评注”，继续给吴晗打掩护。你们说什么这些信件“说明”吴晗走的是“成名成家的资产阶级道路”；说什么吴晗在相当一段时期内“还只是在学术上请教”胡适；说什么吴晗在九一八事变以后还有“一点点淡薄的民族观念”；说什么吴晗“从一九三○年以来唯一无条件地接受了的是胡适派实用主义”，“三十年来，他走的就是这条道路”。按照你们的说法，吴晗只不过是在学术上跟着胡适走，并没有成为洋奴胡适的忠实奴才，并没有全盘接受胡适反共反人民反革命的衣钵、追随胡适走上反革命的道路。这叫什么“彻底揭露吴晗”呢？这叫什么“坚决”“斗争”呢？
    人们只要运用阶级观点来分析这些信件，就不难看出，吴晗和胡适的关系不仅是什么学术上的关系，而且是反动的政治关系；吴晗三十年来的道路不仅是什么实用主义的道路，而且是一条反共反人民反革命的道路。
    你们公布这批材料，还有一个极可耻的目的，那就是向一些积极批判吴晗的革命者暗放冷箭。你们假借批判吴晗的“先史后论”，攻击被你们称为“想在二十四小时里就一鸣惊人的人”。人们知道，吴晗的“先史后论”，就是要“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”，具体地说，就是胡适的所谓“处处脚踏实地”，“勤劳”，“细细点读《明史》”，钻到史料堆里去。这和“有些想在二十四小时里就一鸣惊人的人”有什么相干呢？你们把这两件完全相反的事情硬扯在一起，不只是逻辑的混乱，显然，你们是另有所指的。你们的矛头究竟是指向谁？我们看来，只能是指向今天那些积极参加社会主义文化大革命的同志。
    你们既然敢于如此这般，人们就有理由问：你们和吴晗一伙之间究竟是什么样的关系？
    下面，我们也把这批信件加上按语，请读者拿来同《历史研究》编辑部的评注加以对照、比较，从而得出自己的结论。　史绍宾　五月三十一日
    吴晗致胡适（一九三○年三月十九日）适之先生：
    去年我做了一篇《中国古籍上之南洋诸国研究地名索引》，是预备做南洋诸国研究的初步工作材料，是把二十四史、稗史、唐人宋人笔记小说等等有关于南洋的图书汇集的分析起来，做成功一个索引。到今年开学的时候，我又找到几部书，预备把它重新编制一下。
    上星期在整理《佛国记》的时候，忽然引起我研究法显的兴味，内中有几点：
    1、《佛国记》称中天竺为中国（自称则为秦人汉人）。
    a“乌苌国，北天竺也；尽作中天竺语。中天竺，所谓中国，俗人衣服饮食亦与中国同。”
    b“……从是以南，名为中国。中国寒暑调，无霜雪。……”
    c“凡诸中国，以此国城邑为大。”
    d“中国寒暑均调，树木或数千岁，乃至万岁。”
    e“法显发长安六年，到中国停六年，还三年。”
    2、往返年月矛盾：据记言，法显于宏始二年发长安，往返十五年，则还年应为义熙九年（413A．D．）。据《高僧传》，法显发于隆安三年（399A．D．即后秦宏始二年），往返十五年，则还年亦应为义熙九年。而据《佛国记》“统属刘家”，则还年当在刘裕篡晋之后。据跋言，“是岁甲寅，晋义熙十二年”，则不特不符往返十五年之旨，且甲寅为义熙十年，义熙十二年为丙辰（416A．D．），亦参差。又考《隋书·经籍志》：“法显自长安游天竺，经三十余国，随有经律之处学其书语，译而写之。还至金陵，与天竺禅师跋罗参共辨定，谓僧只律学者传之”，亦无年月明文可考。
    第一点不过是引起研究兴味的动机，将来如能找到旁证，也许可以推翻几家前人对于“中国”二字的界说；第二点的年月问题，我现在预备做一篇法显《佛国记》考或研究，序目如下：
    一、法显传略
    a　年表
    b　历史上的背景（根据《隋书·经籍志》）
    c　时代的背景（根据《南北史》、《晋书》）
    d　后代的影响
    二、法显西行求法年月考
    a　地名今释
    b　西行所至年月表
    三、西行求法的成绩与中土佛教
    四、法显时代的南洋诸国与中土之关系
    五、法显西行求法往返水陆路径图
    关于法显出发时的年月已不成问题，至于回时年月则有一极有力之左证在：
    《佛国记》：“僧中有一大德沙门，名达摩瞿缔，……摩呵毗诃罗精舍有一高德沙门，……国人咸疑是罗汉。……法显至，不及见其生存，唯见葬时……”
    假能找到达摩瞿缔与高德沙门之生卒葬期，则法显回时之年月问题当不难解决了。因为　先生现时正在研究佛教史料，所以我把我的疑问提出来，写信给先生，并且希在可能范围以内给予我下列几点帮助：
    1、达摩瞿缔与此高德沙门之事实（生卒葬）；
    2、关于研究法显所必须的资料的借与（如《高僧传》等书）或指导；
    3、我现所能根据的只是一篇《汉魏丛书》内的《佛国记》，版很坏，我想找到一部较好的版本，把它标点校对出来；另外再把《大唐西域记》、《南海寄归传》校对一过，订在一起或者把它出版。使研究的人可以得到许多方便。此议是否可行？如可，先生能否供给我必需的书籍或替我代借？
    明知先生现在很忙，不过除了先生以外，我实在想不出一个比先生更能用科学的方法来解决和指导路径的人。希望先生能化几分钟的工夫给我一个回信。
              学生　吴春晗（吴晗原名）上　三月十九日
    按：一九二四年到一九三四年，胡适为什么对佛教史发生了浓厚的兴趣？他自己说得很清楚：“从前禅宗和尚曾说，‘菩提达摩东来，只要寻一个不受人惑的人。’我这里千言万语，也只是要教人一个不受人惑的方法。被孔丘朱熹牵着鼻子走，固然不算高明；被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走，也算不得好汉。”（《介绍我自己的思想》）胡适企图乞灵于菩提达摩之流的幽灵，来抵制马克思主义的传播，为帝国主义和蒋介石效劳。吴晗知道胡适“正在研究佛教史料”，急急忙忙投其所好，以作进身之阶。
    胡适向当时的“少年朋友们”兜售实用主义的“一点科学精神，一点科学态度，一点科学方法”。（《介绍我自己的思想》）吴晗就向他献上谀词：“除了先生以外，我实在想不出一个比先生更能用科学的方法来解决和指导路径的人。”这就是说，吴晗是心甘情愿地请求胡适牵着他的鼻子走，走上反共反人民反革命的“路径”。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三○年六月二十九日）适之先生：
    《胡适文存》二集卷四P．174《跋红楼梦考证》有这么一条：
    “（3）曹雪芹的儿子先死了，雪芹感伤成病，不久也死了。据此，雪芹死后，似乎没有后人。”前几个月我做《西王母与昆仑山》的时候，翻了很多书，当中有一部清梁恭辰《北东园杂录》（道光癸卯1843A．D．），内中有一条提及此事，当时把它钞下来，预备你来中公的时候来问你，可是终于没有机会。今天翻读《胡适文存》的时候，又看见了这一条。连忙去找从前钞的来对照，又忘记夹在什么地方去了。现在把梁书提及的大意述之如下：
    ……《红楼梦》作者曹雪芹实有其人，曹为一老贡生，徒抱伯道之嗟！身后萧条零落，无人过问……上文是说一位满洲朋友告诉他，《红楼梦》这部书诲淫的坏处，下文这么说似乎含有“报应”的意思。从这一条上看出来的是：
    a　纪元一八四三前后智识阶级对于《红楼梦》的态度。
    b　那时候人已经知道《红楼梦》是曹雪芹做的。
    c　曹雪芹是一个老贡生。
    d　无子。
    e　身后萧条，无人过问。
    按曹死于一七六四，距《北东园杂录》之成书不过七八十年，且此条所记满人谈话亦不必即为成书之年，当较成书为早。所以我想梁氏所说比较可信，且可证明先生所考之正确。惟c、d两项似有问题，先生以为何如？
                              学生　吴春晗　六，二九。
    又，我下半年要转学到北平燕大去读历史系去，想请先生写一封介绍书，不知道可以吗？
    吴晗致胡适（一九三○年×月二十八日）适之先生：
    先生的《红楼梦考证》页三十七，以敦诚兄弟的诗断定曹雪芹的生卒时代，——生约1715—1720，死乾隆三十年左右，约1765——这是一个极精确的论断，但是先生的话只是假设，并没有什么强硬的同时代的证据。
    近几天在《延芬室稿》找到一些可以证实此问题的材料，特地钞了献给先生。
    永忠的《延芬室稿》的一部分——《志学编》（删定本），二月前我曾替它作了一篇跋，最近燕大图书馆又陆续购得永忠手写的《延芬室稿》全部，约二十七册，这手稿是编年的，极有历史价值，在册十五有这么一条：
    “乾隆三十三年戊子（永忠）年三十四岁……
    “因墨香得观《红楼梦》小说吊雪芹三绝句（姓曹）：
    “传神文笔足千秋，不是情人不泪流。可恨同时不相识，
    几回掩卷哭曹侯。
    颦颦宝玉两情痴，儿女闺房笑语私。三寸柔毫能写尽，欲呼才鬼一中之。
    都来眼底复心头，辛苦才人用意搜。混沌一时七窍凿，争教天不赋穷愁。”
    书楣有批语：墨香曰：“此三章诗极妙，第《红楼梦》非传世小说，余闻之久矣。终不欲一见，恐其中有碍语也”。
    这一小册子的封面上写著：“丙申（1776）六月七日录。”（其他各册亦均有时日。）这诗是永忠三十四岁那年做的，做诗的时候，雪芹已死。诗题云吊，或雪芹即死在是年（1768）或更前？这和先生所假定只差三年，总之雪芹之死在一七六八以前，由此可以断定。由这三首诗和评语，至少可以推出下列事实：
    （1）永忠由墨香处得读《红楼梦》，永忠和雪芹同时而不相识，因读《红楼梦》，适闻噩耗（？）为诗吊之。
    （2）墨香和雪芹或有关系，在墨香的著作中，或可寻出关于雪芹的史料。（墨香待考，数日内或可报命。）
    （3）《红楼梦》中有碍语（？）——故墨香虽“闻之久矣，终不欲一见”。——非传世小说，所谓碍语是当时旧礼教下的假道学者所加于男女事件的代名词，因其有这些事，所以不能为传世小说，这可以代表一七六八前的士大夫阶级对于《红楼梦》的意见，反之，一七六八后的流行，也足以窥见世风的变易，这原因多半可以归到宫廷和社会生活的变革，士大夫阶级的提倡上去。
    （4）诗二以宝玉颦颦并举，自然是指前八十回。先生所说“书未完而曹雪芹死”的一假设，（《红楼梦序》页五三）似有商榷处。因在一七六八年或稍前，永忠已能读《红楼梦》，其非未完可知。在一七六八时墨香已“闻之久矣”，其非成于一七六八左右可知。据此则书成当在一七六八前五年至十年，我以为这可以有两种说法：（一）《红楼梦》在一七六○前后，曹雪芹已把它写成完书，下场是悲剧的，黛玉、湘云、凤姐、香菱等都有结束，永忠所读的就是这本子，故有“不是情人不泪流”之句。（二）高氏所续的或抛了八十回后的一部分，加上自己的，成百二十回本。退一步讲，即使未完，全书也已预定下悲剧的下场，但不是书未完而雪芹死，是未完的书成于雪芹死前七八年，当时或已有刻本（？）否则，雪芹之死，便当移前七八年，约在一七六○左右了。
    （5）雪芹晚年的生活是穷愁潦倒的。
    据《延芬室稿·耆献类征》文艺九《宗室文昭附传·宗室王公世职章京爵秩袭次全表》圣祖皇帝位下：永忠字良甫，号臞仙，一字渠仙，自号延芬室主人，又号如幻居士，九华道人，敬轩主人。多罗恂勤郡王孙，多罗恭勤贝勒弘明次子，乾隆丙子（1756）考封三等辅国将军。生雍正十三年乙卯，卒乾隆五十八年五月（1735—1793），年五十九。他和敦诚、敦敏、敦諴……都有交情，《延芬室稿》约有诗七八百首，文若干首，里面很有一些和他们投赠的诗。
    以上这些是因为我先做了《延芬室稿》中的《志学编》的跋，近几天重读先生的考证，见有引永忠的去处，便开始注意这部破稿本，果然找出这么一些来，高兴极了，立刻写信告诉先生。
    据这书的内含而论，内中一定还有关于曹雪芹的诗，我明天还要细细的找去。（因为纸已陈旧，只能慢慢地翻）或者再有发现，亦未可知。
    敦诚一辈人的生卒事迹，有否再考查的必要？假使先生要，我可以把一切永忠和他们投赠的诗钞奉。生卒也有查出的可能。
    明陈文烛的《二酉园文集》有沔阳卢氏《湖北先正遗书》本，已请图书馆购得。附闻，专此谨颂康健
                          学生　吴春晗上　二十八日晚
    按：胡适关于《红楼梦》的“研究”，是洋奴买办文化的一个标本。“适之先生”作了“大胆的假设”，“学生吴春晗”连忙“小心的求证”。
     一九六二年五四青年节，吴晗在《关于研究历史的几个问题》这篇讲话中，无耻地向青年推荐自己的“经验”：“抄书这一关很重要，要眼勤手勤，否则就要吃亏，我是常吃这个亏的。”读了这封信，可以知道：吴晗的所谓“眼勤”，就是要看准主子的喜好。所谓“手勤”，就是要勤抄书，进献资料；勤写信，表白忠忱。所谓“吃亏”，就是漏抄了一条可作敲门砖的材料，后悔莫及。吴晗的一整套“经验”，就是这一类奴才趋炎附势的登龙术。
    吴晗最近抵赖：一九五四、一九五五年由《红楼梦研究》批判引起的胡适批判，他所以一声不吭，是因为参加了政府工作，公务繁忙，手头又没有一本胡适的书。这封信拆穿了吴晗的弥天大谎。原来，当年的吴晗就是胡适派“红学”的一个小娄罗，他不愿意背叛师教，看来不是没有缘故的。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三一年五月五日）适之先生：
    在两个月以前，找到一篇《婺书》中吴之器撰的《胡应麟传》。撰者的时代稍后于胡氏，在这篇传中说胡氏的卒年是在万历三十年壬寅（1562），存年五十二岁。这可以把顾颉刚先生在《四部正讹序》中所提及的应麟卒年问题解决了。（他在序中据江湛然的话推存年在六十以上）恰巧前几天由燕大图书馆借来一部《少室山房全集》和《弇州四部稿》，就费了将近半个月的工夫在二书中辑出关于胡氏生平的事历，另外翻了一些和应麟同时代人的诗文集和地志，以及《明诗综》、《金华艺文志》、《全浙诗话》一类书，和中海图书馆所藏的《太函集》、《二酉园诗集》诸书，草成了一篇将近三四万字的《胡应麟年谱》。
    似乎是胡氏的事迹在校点本《四部正讹》未出世以前，还没有人注意过，有些攻驳他的就只攻击他的依附王世贞（《明史·文苑传》），又或如钱牧斋之专攻他的《诗薮》，沈德符和四库诸臣之吹毛求疵，检他不留心的偶误加以抨策。反之，替他说好话的如朱彝尊之流，也只空空洞洞地以“读书种子”四字了之。至于他的事迹，则似从未有人加以注意，即有之，亦荒谬不足据。
    现在我所能找到的材料，全已分系在各年之下，除开有矛盾的地方，我自己不参加什么意见，他的重要著作的自序，因为可以说明本书的旨趣和见解，也一起钞下，材料的引用是以应麟自撰的为主，其他可以参证者副之，例如王世贞的《胡元瑞传》是据应麟自撰的《石羊生小传》增减而成，《胡观察传》是据《家大人履历述》撰成。这样，除开王撰的有异同之外，便全据胡氏，间或两传合用。
    他是明代名士气极重，到处结社，标榜，空疏浅薄的时代下的产儿，他自己也是长安社、白榆社中的人物，在他的出生前的五十年中的所谓前后七子的最盛期，和他的一生有极大的影响，我预备把年谱分成三段：（1）从正德元年到嘉靖二十九年，七子运动时期。（2）从嘉靖三十年到万历三十年，应麟年谱。（3）从万历三十一年到现在（A）应麟著述的刊本编年（B）前人对于应麟的批评。
    这作法不知道对不对？请先生能费一点工夫，多多指教。我所参考的书很有限，也希望先生能另外介绍一些给我。
    因为没有和先生直接谈过话的缘故，最后要替我自己介绍一下：我是一九二九进中国公学的学生，去年先生离开中公后，我也立刻到北平来转燕京大学，不料到北平后燕京又不许我入学，因为我在中公的英文成绩是C，虽然在转学时他们曾寄入学允许证来。后来颉刚先生介绍我到燕大图书馆中日文编考部作事。现在我又要想下半年到北京大学史学系插班，因为恐蹈去年的复辙，就辞了燕大的职务，先时预备功课，所以现在有时间来写这篇年谱。
    　学生　吴春晗　五月五日
    按：吴晗拍马有术：先是提问题，后是献材料；眼看时机成熟，随即“自我介绍”。果然，皇天不负苦心人，第二天，佳音传到。
    吴晗在解放后无耻地为胡适辩解，说胡适因为反对蒋介石，被迫离开中国公学。并且撒谎：“他一走，我想在中国公学再念下去也无聊”，“就糊里糊涂跑到北平”。（《我克服了“超阶级”观点》）这封信说明，吴晗千方百计地钻进美蒋奴才胡适的门下，死心踏地跟着他走，完全清清楚楚，哪里糊里糊涂？
    胡适复吴晗（一九三一年五月六日）春晗同学：
    我记得你，并且知道你的工作。
    你作《胡应麟年谱》，我听了很高兴。
    前年我曾推断胡氏“死时年约五十岁”，（见我的《文存》三集》页六三○）但我的根据很少，不过是一个假定而已。今得你寻出吴之器所作传，考定他死在万历三十年，年五十二岁，与我的假定相差甚微。
    但你信上在万历三十年下注“1562”，是大错。不知何以有此误。此年是1602。生年是1551。
    你的分段也甚好，写定时我很想看看。星期有暇请来谈。罗尔纲君住我家中。　
    胡适　廿，五，六。
   按：这是胡适给吴晗的第一封信，对吴晗阿谀和逢迎的“工作”，表示“记得”和“知道”。主子给奴才下了第一道嘉奖令，并且立即召见。从此，吴晗登堂入室，得附骥尾，成了胡适手下一名反革命的“过河卒子”。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三一年×月十九日）
   〔本件上缺〕
    去年冬间，发心编一个《四史人名索引》，——我以为研究古代史，应该从两汉倒溯，但是苦于事迹的不集中，无法整理，所以有编人名、地名和其他索引的必要——到现在已经写好了四五万片子，经过两三度的校对（底本用殿本，校本用百衲本的景祐本和金陵本）和排比，大约下半年如能入学，年底可以成功。可是困难的问题极多，现在举几个大的请你指教。
    （1）索引本为便于检查而作，故篇幅应力求撙节，现在我定的体例是参《史姓韵编》而更详其所略，略其所详。姓名下具列籍贯、家系（如○○子，○○弟）、字、号、异名，而不著其仕履（仅列封爵），其所见亦仅举史几、汉几卷，而不标明页数行数，此不第因无一标准版本可据，抑且太繁，恐不便用。不过师友人中亦有以为应详举页行者，其理由以为如不如此，仍不便检查，第如遵照此说，则四史中如汉高、汉武、光武、司马氏、曹氏及诸将相每人须各列举数十百条，即在同卷中亦须数十见，究竟应否标举页行？此其一。
    （2）中国辞字诸书分类，向来依照《说文》部首分列，晚近四角号码分部亦复风行一时。此索引之分类编列，究宜从旧从新，二者以何为便？此其二。
    （3）国人习尚相沿，称谓喜以字里别号相冠，其著者固尽人皆知，其微者则易滋淆乱，拟于索引后附异名表、封爵表。谱系之学，昔人所重，沿源溯流，亦可窥见思想渊源、社会地位，拟于索引后附世系表。其古帝（如三皇五帝三代）列国（如秦）彼此不同者则具录所出，借资探考。又如刘向、钦、德、韩信、周勃之流，两汉一代，姓名雷同者每以十数，往昔诸贤同姓名录之作，仅限有传者，多未详备，拟于索引后附同姓名录。
    以上几条，不过是其荦荦大者，此外如去取，妇女，神仙之甄录，有名无姓或仅一字，匈奴南蛮之氏族等等，在在均成问题。盼望你能简单地指示给我一条明路！
    上次你所说的北大旁听生制度，我已去问明，据说现在没有这种制度了。现在我对于英文、西洋史、逻辑等尚有法可想——英文我现在能够看书，就是文法不了了——就是数学要抱佛脚，也来不及。这真是一个致命的打击！
    又，我想找出钱牧斋批评胡应麟的话，这几天曾把四部丛刊本的《初学集》和《有学集》翻了一遍，不料竟找不出来。不知道是否在旁的书中？你能告诉我吗！
                              学生　吴春晗上　十九日午
    按：为什么不能到北京大学去旁听，就那么丧魂落魄？很简单，当时在北京大学任教的胡适，已经以一个美帝国主义代理人的身份，出现在政治舞台上。吴晗看准了胡适是能够给他“指示”“一条明路”、掌握他命运的靠山，因此，不能到北大去当胡适的跟班，对他“真是一个致命的打击！”
    吴晗致胡适（一九三一年×月十八日）适之先生：
    《婺书》八卷，经请托家乡的朋友向四处邻近各县大索，竟不能找到。此书《四库总目》及《浙江采集遗书总目》均未著录，晚近胡季樵氏著《金华经籍志》始引用之。前人如王崇炳之《金华征献略》亦于是书多所取材。不知道《金华丛书》和《续金华丛书》为什么不把它收入？
    现在这个本子是向家乡的朋友借来的，尚有《婺书别录》四卷，臆其命名，似是著此书时所余之零章断句，别为一编，可惜也找不著，否则我想里面一定有些可贵的史料，足供引用。现在先把这四册寄上。
    卷四的《胡应麟传》所叙述的也有错的地方，如“后司马（汪道昆）殁，而应麟愈重，诸词客裹粮入婺者踵相接，皆以事弇州、伯玉（即汪道昆）者事之，莫敢异词。如是又十余年，万历壬寅卒”。据《太函集序》推，伯玉死只在应麟前三数年，大概是他把汪道贯的卒年误为伯玉的卒年，否则即是文笔上的夸张。
    从尔纲兄处得到先生勉谕的话，非常感激，同时又惭恨自己过去的不长进，我不敢向先生说一些“道谢”的浮文，只是时时刻刻地警戒著自己，使他日不致辜负先生的期望和好意。
                            谨祝康健
                                学生　吴春晗上　十八日晚
    按：这个时候，吴晗还没有完全达到胡适所要求的政治标本的水平，所以“惭恨自己过去的不长进”。从此以后，果然大有“长进”了。
    吴晗深知，要继承胡适的衣钵，只说一些
    “‘道谢’的浮文”是不够的。吴晗三十多年来的肮脏历史证明，他确实“时时刻刻地警戒着自己”。他的反共、反人民、反革命的全部实践，的确没有“辜负先生的期望和好意”。
    胡适复吴晗（一九三一年九月十二日）春晗同学：
    你的信使我很高兴。蒋张诸公之厚意最可感谢，甚盼你见他们时为我道谢。
    蒋先生期望你治明史，这是一个最好的劝告。秦汉时代材料太少，不是初学所能整理，可让成熟的学者去工作。材料少则有许多地方须用大胆的假设，而证实甚难。非有丰富的经验，最精密的方法，不能有功。
    晚代历史，材料较多，初看去似甚难，其实较易整理，因为处处脚踏实地，但肯勤劳，自然有功。凡立一说，进一解，皆容易证实，最可以训练方法。
    你问的几项，大致可以解答如下：
    （1）应先细细点读《明史》；同时先读《明史纪事本末》一遍或两遍。《实录》可在读《明史》后用来对勘。此是初步工作。于史传中之重要人的姓名、字、号、籍贯、谥法，随笔记出，列一表备查，将来读文集杂记等书便不感觉困难。读文集中之碑传，亦须用此法。
    （2）满洲未入关以前的历史，有人专门研究；可先看孟森（心史）《清开国史》（商务）一类的书。你此时暂不必关心。此是另一专门之学。谢国桢君有此时期史料考，已由北平图书馆出版。（孟心史现在北大。）
    （3）已读得一代全史之后，可以试作“专题研究”之小论文（Monographs）；题目越小越好，要在“小题大做”，可以得训练。千万不可作大题目。
    （4）札记最有用。逐条必须注明卷册页数，引用时可以复检。许多好“专题研究”皆是札记的结果。
    （5）明代外人记载尚少，但如“倭寇”问题，西洋通商问题，南洋问题，耶稣会教士东来问题，皆有日本及西洋著述可资参考。蒋廷黻先生必能指导你，我是全外行。
    以上匆匆答复定不能满意。
                                  胡适　廿，九，十二。
    请你记得：治明史不是要你做一部新明史，只是要你训练自己作一个能整理明代史料的学者。你不要误会蒋先生劝告的意思。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三一年九月二十六日）适之先生：
    凭著　先生的好意，得入清大，一眨眼又是三星期了。上次先生所指示的几项，读后恍如在无边的旷野中，夜黑人孤，骤然得著一颗天际明星，光耀所及，四面八方都是坦途。在上星期已托人买了一部崇文本的《明史》，逐日点读，另外做了几千卡片装了几只匣子，分为（1）人名（2）书名（3）纪事三种，按类填写。比较复杂的就写上札记簿。准备先把明史念完后，再照　先生所指示的逐步做去。
    关于工作方面，上星期蒋先生说（在向他道谢的时候）校务会议已经规定：“研究生欲在校内兼任工作者须得主任允许，工作时间每日不得过二小时，报酬月不得过二十五元。”生的工作范围，已定整理档案，不过因为新图书馆内部布置尚未完工，须一月后方能开始工作。这事始终都是先生的力量，谨在此向先生致最恳挚的谢意！
    关于胡应麟的，生前此曾陆续查出：
    （1）《区大相诗集》卷十七　壬寅闻两胡生亡豫章胡比部汝焕兰溪胡孝廉应麟
    （2）《南谿寤歌》卷上　游唐氏可园因怀王鹤潭兼吊胡少室园为胡少室二酉山房旧址
    （3）《人海记》记二酉藏书由来
    （4）应麟晚年情景（见前信）
    最近在清大图书馆又得一明万历甲寅良贵堂刻本《少室山房笔丛》，此本前有（1）殷城黄吉士序（2）兰溪赵承宠序（3）陈文烛序（他本俱无黄赵二序）；卷首题：
    安定胡应麟明瑞撰
    南阳赵世宠承甫校
    壻赵三极一兼梓从此题识和赵序的：“余葭莩元瑞，得携孺子三极造二酉”，知良贵堂即赵家堂名，世宠和元瑞是两亲家，三极是应麟的女婿（此女即在潞河所生者）。更从黄序知道此书在明末至少有（1）元瑞生前自刻本（2）金华江湛然类稿刻本（3）金陵翻刻本（4）良贵堂刻本。
    清大又另藏一附有《甲乙剩言》一卷本，此书虽然没有刊刻年月，不过它的款式和金华类稿本无别，纸色刊板，均不失毫发，可断其即金华本另行而益以《甲乙剩言》者。（《甲乙剩言》明刻有宝颜堂秘笈本）通行《少室笔丛》都没有这一种附录，也可算是明刻《笔丛》的第五本。
    颉刚先生校点《四部正讹》时，序中曾言文津本不可据，他所提到的也只有一个金华本和清广雅本，生发现此二本后，本来想立刻告诉他，可是跑去几次，都未见著，前星期匆匆见了一面，也不能把详细情形告诉他。生很希望能得顾先生的允许，把这几本子再来校勘一下，看有什么不同的地方没有？
    《胡应麟年谱》的稿子，原只是一个极潦草的初稿，因为知道先生很注意他，所以才敢送给先生看。在写好后到现在又陆续找出这些材料，恐怕将来把这些东西丢了，或者竟会失去对他的兴趣，所以生现在预备把它再写一次，在写二稿前想请先生指示在初稿中的错误和应注意和简略及其他地方，不知道先生能够应许不？此稿现如在先生处，并请寄还，以便重写。前寄给先生的《婺书》，无需寄回，就请先生替我们家乡永远保存著吧！ 　谨颂康健　             学生　吴春晗上　廿六日
    按：这是一来一往的两封信。《北京日报》曾经发表了一篇《史家谈治史》的吴晗访问记（一九六二年八月三十一日），宣扬吴晗成为“明史专家”的经过，说什么一九三二年前后，由于发现了胡惟庸党案记载的矛盾，“揭开了吴晗同志研究明史的序幕”。这两封信告诉我们，吴晗研究明史，完全是奉胡适、蒋廷黻之命。《北京日报》完全是在帮吴晗撒谎。
    胡适关于如何研究明史的几点指示，其中大有奥妙。吴晗对这些指示心领神会，身体力行，三十多年来一贯“照先生所指示的逐步做去”。他很会用“札记”的形式，借历史的“小题”，“大做”反革命的文章。《海瑞骂皇帝》就是个典型。
    在这以前，吴晗已经完全接受了胡适“度与”他的实用主义“金针”，为什么还会有“恍如在无边的旷野中，夜黑人孤”的感觉呢？那是因为他在政治上还没有成为胡适的心腹。这时，依靠“先生的力量”，得到“主任允许”，每月有一、二十块钱的卖身银，特别是领到了一张“训练自己作一个”“学者”的保票，这样，胡适就成了吴晗的“一颗天际明星”，“光耀所及”，一直照到今天。
    胡适为吴晗在清华大学谋求“工读”的介绍信，现已找到。附于文末，供大家参考。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三一年十二月十五日）适之先生：
    《清明上河图与金瓶梅的故事》一文，在暑假中仓卒草成，本不想发表，因想买一部《明史纪事本末》，一时凑不起钱，所以只能送与本校周刊，拿到了十块钱，大概可以买一部了。
    “文中不宜多用表字，”此意　先生前已面示，此次仓卒不及改正，以后当极力避免。
    下篇正在搜辑材料中，拟将嘉隆间著作一律搜齐翻阅一过后再下笔，恐非一时所可办到。
    近日在点读《明史》，时时发现有极危险和可笑的错误，现将所抄札记摘录二条于下：
    卷二八五《赵埙传》附《乌斯道传》：“傅恕字如心，鄞人。学通经史，与同郡乌斯道、郑真皆有文名……斯道字继善，慈谿人……子缉亦善诗文。洪武四年举乡试第一，授临淮教谕，入见赐之宴，赋诗称旨，除广信教授，自号荥阳外史。”检《明史稿》，缉作熙，文下洪上有“真字千之”四字，与史不同。按《史稿》与《明史》两皆失之。据张时彻《宁波府志·文学传》：“子熙光，字缉之，为国子监监丞，亦以诗文擅名”。《慈谿县志·文苑传》文同。是则斯道子名熙光字缉之，《明史》作缉固误，《史稿》作熙亦误。《史稿》“真字千之”四字，乃承上文郑真而言，洪字下所述俱真事迹，《明史》落此四字，便尔张冠李戴，大误。
    二八三《陈献章传》：“献章……久之复游太学，祭酒邢让试和杨时《此日不再得》诗一篇，惊曰：‘龟山不如也！’”飏言于朝，以为真儒复出，由是名震京师。”一段文意不明，似和杨诗为邢让所作，与献章无与，按《明史稿》传一六○，篇字下惊字上多“让得之”三字，则此诗为献章所和，让得之飏言于朝也。《史》、《稿》文两皆失之，据文意应作：“久之复游太学，试和杨时《此日不再得》诗一篇，祭酒邢让得之，惊曰：‘龟山不如也！’”事实始不颠倒。
    《明史》经数十大儒之努力，积六十年之辛勤，乃纰谬如此，其他讹误尚不可枚举，此故生意以为清人深中古文之毒，及欧阳“文简事增”之言，只求有合于古，任意节落，初不计事实之背违，且官修之史，人自为政，为之主者虽博洽绝伦，亦未能发现类此之小误，不知先生以为然否？
    《胡应麟年谱》早已收到，近日穷日夜之力，重加编正，已二易稿，将一年中事迹设法联成一起，小注另提出附于年后，整理结果，前稿弃去者十之五，增入者亦十之五，回顾前稿之纰陋矛盾，不禁汗下，追思前此之遽以是稿呈政于先生，益觉惭惶无地！重正稿约一月后可卒业，以苦于基本应用书如《明通纪》、《明鉴》、《四库总目》之非自备不可（《明史》已设法购得），届时拟仍呈政于先生，并为介绍发表（清大周刊千字只七角稿费），深知冒昧发表之非是，然意在易书，还祈先生谅之。谨颂康健　学生　吴春晗上　十五日
    按：《胡应麟年谱》竭力推崇胡应麟钻故纸堆，闭门著书，“世间事无足上眉尖胸次者”，“是非臧否，一切置之罔闻。”实际上是通过胡应麟来宣扬胡适的反动“科学救国”路线。这篇文章发表在
    《清华学报》九卷一期上。吴晗在解放后自吹自擂，他当学生的时候，“居然在清华学报、燕京学报发表论文了，稿费收入比较多”。（《我克服了“超阶级”观点》）原来，他能够在学报上发表论文，收入“比较多”的稿费，完全是靠拍马屁，苦苦哀求“适之先生”为之“介绍发表”。
    吴晗致胡适（一九三二年一月三十日）适之先生：
    有一疑难问题，数月来??（耿耿）于胸，未能解决，盼望先生指示一个出路！
    处在现今的时局中，党国领袖卖国，政府卖国，封疆大吏卖国，每日看报所能得到的是最初“镇静，镇静！”次之是“政府已有最后准备，下最大决心，请信任，信任！”现在是：“一切你们所要的都答应，只要不拆我们的台就感谢不尽，无条件的屈服，屈服！”
    翻开任何国任何朝代的史来看，找不出这样一个卑鄙无耻丧心病狂的政府，也很难找到这样麻木不仁浑浑噩噩的国民。
    学生不应离开学校去作无聊的举动！如发传单，喊打倒之类。但是应否作个别行动，为自己争人格，为国家争光荣？这行动是否有意义？学生一无可杀人的枪械，二无可凭借的势位，三无可号召的群众，空口说“救国”是否有用？（现在平津一带连“救国”都无人提起了）假如不，看着人家大批出卖你的父母兄弟，听着若干千万同胞的被屠宰的哭声，成天所见到的消息又只是“屈服”“退让”，假使自己还是个人，胸膛中还有一滴热血在著的时候，这苦痛如何能忍受？
    自杀，是不负责任的卑鄙行为，但是假如自己是活人，又能比长眠人幸福多少？至少他们不致再受我们所受的苦痛。
    过去四个月，无时无刻不被这种苦痛所蹂躏，最初的克制方法，是把自己深藏在图书馆中，但是一出了馆门，就仍被袭击，后来专写文章，冀图避免此项思虑，但是仍不成功……在就睡后仍陷于一种无可奈何的深思中，结果是成为照例的失眠。最近在历史系开始工作，整理咸、同、光三朝的《京报》，把它编一目录，起初几天，倒也感觉兴趣，可是后来渐渐有对外关系和军事种种的纪载出现，不由地把它和现在的一一比较，结果只是使你愤怒，扼腕；假使可能的时候，情愿时光倒流，至少那几个皇帝和大臣只是无能，短见，而决不是卖国，屈服！
    为著要知道现状的进展，不得不每天看报，但是看报的结果又只是使你气不得，笑不得，“不幸而为中国人”，这一天便也再不能沉下气去做一点什么事了。
    这苦痛不能向有党籍的人吐露，也不能告诉根本没有主张的人，生在过去，备受先生的训诲指导，盼望此时先生也同样地予以解决的方法并指示一条应走的路。敬颂康健！
                              学生　吴春晗上　一月卅日
    后附还汇票洋四十元，请检收为盼。
    按：一九三一年的九一八事变，使日本帝国主义和中国的矛盾变得特别突出，特别尖锐起来。国内的阶级关系发生了新的调度。在中国共产党的领导下，全国人民大规模地起来为救亡而斗争。形势逼人。在这个动荡和变化的时刻，吴晗有些着慌了，赶紧向他的“明星”请求指示。他在信里，说了一些不满国民党政府的假话，也流露出憎恨抗日人民和爱国学生运动的真情。对上口径以后，他就按照胡适“指示应走的路”，“在国家蒙奇辱大难的时候”，“把自己深藏在图书馆中”，执行“科学救国”的反动路线。同时，还用化名在《清华周刊》上发表文章，大骂爱国学生运动是“装门面”，“显时髦”，去时“一窝蜂”，回来“鸟兽散”（《过去种种》）。《历史研究》编辑部所说的，吴晗的“那一点点淡薄的民族观念”，究竟在哪里呢？
    吴晗致胡适（一九三二年四月二十四日）适之师：
    先生的文章已经叫人钞好拿去付印了，现在把原稿先行挂号奉还。
    今午同蒋廷黻先生谈话，他说他正在发愁，因为《独立》周报预备在下下星期出版，第一期稿件已齐，却还找不到一个合式的经理人。生因此想起五星期前同黎昔非君到协和来看先生的时候，先生曾提过此事，并问黎君愿否帮忙，就把这话告诉蒋先生，他很高兴，叫生即刻写信，请先生决定并征求昔非同意（他住银匣大丰公寓）。
    这半年来读《明史》，发生了无数的问题，其中最叫人疑心的一个是胡惟庸事件。据明史《胡惟庸传》、《日本传》、《李善长传》诸记载，是胡惟庸想造反，私使明州卫指挥林贤下海招倭，使元遗臣封绩往漠北请援，日本国良怀遣僧如瑶率四百人伪为贡献巨烛，中藏兵器，谋乘机为助，未至而惟庸败，至十七年（一作二十年七月，一作十五年）林贤事发，族之，乃绝日本，著祖训，列为不征之国。这事叙述非常可疑，关系非常重大，中日诸纪载又均有矛盾，如：
    （1）《纪事本末》载太监云奇事，说胡惟庸请太祖幸第谋行刺，被云奇阻，事发，诛惟庸。此说本《列卿记》附录，雷礼又本之何孟春《云奇墓碑》。原碑未指明姓名，何氏臆断为惟庸。此事《皇明史窃》、《皇明泳化类编》、《明书》、《殊域周咨录》、《纪事本末补编》、《从信录》、《法传录》诸书皆笃信之。
    （2）日使如瑶，中日诸书均以为良怀所遣，《资治通纪》及《苍霞草》则以为义满所遣。最后一次来华时代，《筹海图编》以为洪武二十年，《明史》以为十七年，诸书或作十五年。
    （3）胡惟庸罪状，《明史》所录系据《实录》，全载当时口供。不可信。（其价值与严世蕃口供等，王世贞笃信之，其子士骐则疑非是。）其被诛前过失，诸书亦所载不一，综为（一）毒死刘基，此有黄伯生《诚意伯行状》可据。疑即由太祖指使惟庸行毒，复中以罪图灭口，故史隐约其辞；（二）壅蔽安南贡使；（三）私没入官妇女；（四）其子死市中，惟庸杀挽人被罪；（五）榜关吏为诸奸利；（六）通倭；（七）通朝鲜三佛齐；（八）通元；（九）谋刺诸端，均矛盾可疑。
    （4）惟庸大罪为通倭，诸书所记皆类儿戏，且《明史》言：“十七年七月林贤事发……”不见《实录》及任何纪载。惟庸死后与日本之诏勅不及此事。日本纪载亦无一字及之，即有，亦皆采自中籍。
    （5）李善长之冤，王国用疏已及之。太祖猜忌，诸元勋宿将均遭非罪诛夷，胡文臣且初曾寄心腹，惧其泄青田死事，故借其平日不慊之行为陷以叛逆，不惜伪造口实，著之祖训，一面明知不能征服日本，而又无法阻其入寇，因曲为之引，借端绝交，诸家纪载但凭《实录》，日人又凭中籍，适堕太祖计中，以致数百年来，人均为所欺。
    其余可疑之处极多。生打算在暑假前写一篇文章耑论此事，以说明明代初叶之中日外交关系，一扫前人之说。不过还不敢十分自信，极盼先生能予以指教。
    又异称《日本传》引涂山《明政统宗》七：“永乐五年八月，勅陕西行都司都指挥陈敬等及巡按监察御史禁止外交。上曰：‘臣无外交，古有明戒。太祖高皇帝申明此禁，最为严切。如胡惟庸私往卜宠吉儿、通日本等处，祸及身家，天下后世晓然知也。……’”文中卜宠吉儿疑即北边地名，但化了很多功夫都查不出在那儿，这条材料又仅见于此地，无所参证。不知先生能介绍一位专治元明西北史地的为解此疑否？
    前在协和曾谈及《绿野仙踪》抄本事，先生当时说打算把它抄一部出来。生后又与振铎先生谈，亦极赞此举。假如先生认为此书有抄出之价值，生当嘱在燕京图书馆服务之友人设法买一部木刻本，光抄它不同的所在。此友已允许完全尽义务代为校抄，一候示到，便可举行。专此谨颁。康健
                      学生　吴春晗上　二十四日晚十二时
    按：信中所说的《独立》周报，即臭名昭著的《独立评论》周刊。这是胡适纠合蒋廷黻、丁文江等人办的反动刊物。吴晗能够参与机密，为这个反动刊物推荐“合式的经理人”，显然已是胡适进行反革命活动的一名伙计。《历史研究》编辑部轻轻地说，吴晗“在一九三○年以来唯一无条件地接受了的是胡适派实用主义”，这不明明白白地是在替吴晗的反动政治面目打掩护吗？
    吴晗致胡适（一九三二年五月十三日）适之师：《文史专号》已出版，兹奉上二册。
    生有一北大友人千家驹君，此次在《文史号》撰《东印度公司之解散与鸦片战争》一文，他是用新的观点来作一个尝试，虽不能说是成功，却似乎比时下一般自命为物观者之生吞活剥、削趾就履来得强一些。千君是一个比较肯用功看书的人，他从前曾写过一些文章，如在《平等》上发表之《抵制日货之史的考察及中国之工业化问题》、《中日外交关系之过去与现在》等文，都还有点新见。他是一个畸零人，自幼便见弃于旧官僚的父亲，凭著自己的努力，工读到现在，今年在北大经济系毕业了。他很想来见先生，不知可以否？
    生本想暑假中在校多念一点书，不料一星期前接到家信说生父病势转重（一年前已病），嘱一放假便带弟一同回家，现定七月初动身回里。倘有不测，生家除生兄弟二人在平读书外，别无长丁，前途茫茫，真是不堪设想！

    按：“生吞活剥、削趾就履”，历来是反动派咒骂马克思主义的陈词滥调。自称“一九三○年以来”就“无条件地接受了历史唯物论”的吴晗，原来却是对唯物史观这样深恶痛绝的反动家伙。
    附录：
    胡适给清华大学代理校长和教务长的信（一九三一年八月十九日）咏霓子高两兄：
    清华今年取了的转学生之中，有一个吴春晗，是中国公学转来的。他是一个很有成绩的学生，中国旧文史的根柢很好。他有几种研究，都很可观；今年他在燕大图书馆做工，自己编成《胡应麟年谱》一部，功力判断都不弱。此人家境甚贫，本想半工半读；但他在清华无熟人，恐难急切得工作的机会。所以我写这信恳求两兄特别留意此人，给他一个工读的机会，他若没有工作的机会，就不能入学了。我劝他决定入学，并许他代求两兄帮忙。此事倘蒙两兄大力相助，我真感激不尽。附上他的《胡应麟年谱》一册，或可觇他的学力。此稿请便中仍赐还。匆匆奉求。即乞便中示复为感。

    他的稿本可否请清华史学系中国文学系的教授一阅？也许他们用得着这样的人作“助手”。

    按：此信原载一九六六年五月十日清华大学校刊《新清华》。该刊编者按说，这封信是该校副校长张子高同志回忆起并设法找出的。信中“咏霓”即翁文灏（当时清华大学代理校长）；“子高”即张子高同志（当时清华大学教务长）。翁文灏批语中所提的“冯蒋二君”，即当时清华大学文学院院长冯友兰和历史系主任蒋廷黻。
