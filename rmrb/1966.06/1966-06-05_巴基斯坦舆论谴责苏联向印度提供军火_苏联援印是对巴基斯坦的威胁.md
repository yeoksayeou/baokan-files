    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 2nd - Pakistani public opinion continues to demand that the Soviet Union immediately stop supplying arms to India.

    According to a report in the "Dawn" on the 2nd, a delegation from the Association of Former and Current Parliamentarians, led by the association's secretary-general, Jafar, met in Karachi on the 1st with the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation led by First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mazurov, who is currently visiting Pakistan. They asked the Soviet delegation to convey to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Kosygin, the strong reaction of the Pakistani people to the Soviet supply of arms to India. The Pakistani delegation told the Soviet delegation that these Soviet arms would be used by India against the Pakistani people and the people of Kashmir, just as the United States' arms were used during India's recent armed aggression against Pakistan.

    Rawalpindi's "Mountain Newspaper" published an editorial on the 2nd titled "Soviet Arms are a Threat to Pakistan," stating: "India's war preparations are aimed at Pakistan, and the Soviet Union's arms assistance to India will definitely be used against Pakistan."

    Rawalpindi's "Pakistan Times" also called on the Soviet Union not to give military assistance to India in an editorial on the 2nd regarding the visit of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation. The editorial said that this "will only exacerbate tensions."

    Karachi's "Leader Newspaper" said in an editorial on May 31st that Soviet arms assistance to India "will only fuel the flames of war in this region."

    An editorial in the "Achievement Newspaper" on the 1st said that the Soviet Union's arms assistance to India would encourage India's aggressive ambitions against Pakistan and help India intensify its massacre of the oppressed people of Kashmir under Indian occupation.

    巴基斯坦舆论谴责苏联向印度提供军火
    苏联援印是对巴基斯坦的威胁
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二日电　巴基斯坦舆论继续要求苏联立即停止向印度提供军火。
    据《黎明报》二日报道，由前任和现任议员协会秘书长贾法尔率领的这一协会的代表团一日在卡拉奇会见了正在巴基斯坦访问的、由部长会议第一副主席马祖罗夫率领的苏联最高苏维埃代表团，要求苏联代表团向苏联部长会议主席柯西金转达巴基斯坦人民对苏联向印度提供军火一事的强烈反应。巴基斯坦方面的代表团对苏联代表团说，这些苏联军火将被印度用来对付巴基斯坦人民和克什米尔人民，就象印度最近对巴基斯坦进行武装侵略期间使用了美国军火一样。
    拉瓦尔品第《山岳报》二日以《苏联军火是对巴基斯坦的威胁》为题发表社论指出：“印度备战的矛头是指向巴基斯坦的，苏联向印度提供的军火援助肯定会被用来对付巴基斯坦。”
    拉瓦尔品第《巴基斯坦时报》二日在就苏联最高苏维埃代表团的访问发表的社论中也要求苏联不要给印度军事援助，社论说，这“只会加剧紧张局势”。
    卡拉奇《领袖报》五月三十一日的社论说：苏联给印度军火援助“只会煽起这个地区的战火”。
    《成就报》一日的社论说：苏联给印度的军火援助会鼓励印度对巴基斯坦的侵略野心，帮助印度加紧屠杀印度占领下的克什米尔的被压迫的人民。
