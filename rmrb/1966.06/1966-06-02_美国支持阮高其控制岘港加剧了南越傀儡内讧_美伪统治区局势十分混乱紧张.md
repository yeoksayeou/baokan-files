    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon) News: With the help of its American masters, the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky-Nguyen Van Thieu clique, after eight days of infighting with the puppet Nguyen Chanh Thi clique, controlled Da Nang on May 23rd. However, the infighting among the South Vietnamese puppets has not been resolved, and the situation in the U.S.-puppet controlled areas remains extremely chaotic and tense.
    According to Western news agencies, after continuous pressure from the U.S. Consul in Da Nang, the leaders of the anti-Nguyen Cao Ky group in Da Nang stated on the 22nd that "they would agree to hold negotiations if the U.S. Marines guaranteed their safety." The next day, surrounded by Nguyen Cao Ky's heavily armed troops, the opposition forces entrenched in two major temples "surrendered" to Nguyen Cao Ky's army. Nguyen Van Man, the puppet mayor of Da Nang from the Nguyen Chanh Thi group, was arrested and escorted to Saigon.
    Western news agencies say that Nguyen Cao Ky was able to control Da Nang because the United States secretly lent a hand. The U.S. authorities also gave him an idea, telling him to "implement according to plan" the "election" fraud orchestrated by the United States, in order to temporarily overcome the crisis. Under the direction of his American masters, Nguyen Cao Ky convened a so-called "Military-Civilian Congress" in Saigon on the 24th, where Nguyen Van Thieu claimed that "the general election for the Constituent Assembly will be held before September 11th" in order to appease the various opposition factions and also to ease the struggle of the masses against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique.
    This "Military-Civilian Congress" convened by the Nguyen Cao Ky clique was boycotted by the Nguyen Chanh Thi group and Buddhist leaders. Currently, the Nguyen Chanh Thi group continues to confront the Nguyen Cao Ky clique. Nguyen Chanh Thi's troops still control a pass on Highway 1 from Da Nang to Hue and have blockaded the Hue airport. Nguyen Chanh Thi, along with Sun Shi Ding, the puppet First Army commander who was dismissed by Nguyen Cao Ky, stated on the 24th that their opposition to Nguyen Cao Ky's activities "will continue." The "Struggle Committee" of Buddhist followers in Hue, opposing Nguyen Cao Ky, also stated on the 24th that it "will continue to resist" Nguyen Cao Ky.
    The situation in the U.S.-puppet controlled areas remains extremely chaotic. Western news agencies say that although Nguyen Cao Ky has controlled Da Nang, this chaotic "political war is still far from resolved" and are concerned that South Vietnam will experience an even "more serious political crisis." Western news agencies also reported that U.S. officials in Washington "breathed a sigh of relief" that Nguyen Cao Ky had controlled Da Nang, but they could not help but admit that the crisis of the South Vietnamese puppet clique had brought the United States' "prestige to a new low." Although Nguyen Cao Ky now controls Da Nang, it is only a "breathing spell" and it cannot be said that the "trouble" has been resolved. (Attached picture)

### 美国支持阮高其控制岘港加剧了南越傀儡内讧  美伪统治区局势十分混乱紧张

    美国支持阮高其控制岘港加剧了南越傀儡内讧
    美伪统治区局势十分混乱紧张
    据新华社讯　西贡消息：在美国主子的帮助下，南越伪阮高其—阮文绍集团在同伪阮正诗集团进行了八天的火并后，五月二十三日控制了岘港。但是，南越傀儡的内讧并未解决，美伪统治区的局势仍然十分混乱和紧张。
    据西方通讯社报道，在美国驻岘港领事不断施加压力之后，岘港的反对阮高其集团的领导人在二十二日表示，“如果美国海军陆战队保证他们的安全，他们将同意举行谈判”。第二天，在阮高其军队的重兵包围下，守在两个主要寺院内的反对派军队向阮高其的军队“投降”，阮正诗集团的伪岘港市长阮文曼被逮捕，并被押往西贡。
    西方通讯社说，阮高其所以能够控制岘港，是由于美国暗中帮了一手。美国当局还给他出了一个主意，要他“按计划执行”美国策划的“选举”骗局，以暂时度过危机。在美国主子的导演下，阮高其二十四日在西贡召开了所谓“军民代表大会”，阮文绍在会上声称“制宪议会的大选将在九月十一日以前举行”，以安抚各反对派，并且也为了缓和人民群众反对阮高其集团的斗争。
    阮高其集团召集的这个“军民代表大会”遭到了阮正诗集团和佛教领导人的抵制。目前，阮正诗集团仍继续同阮高其集团对峙。阮正诗的军队仍然控制着从岘港通往顺化的第一号公路上的一个山口，并且封锁了顺化机场。阮正诗同被阮高其解职的伪第一军军长孙室订等在二十四日表示，他们反对阮高其的活动“将继续下去”。顺化佛教徒反对阮高其的“斗争委员会”也在二十四日表示“将继续抵抗”阮高其。
    目前美伪统治区局势仍然十分混乱。西方通讯社说，尽管阮高其控制了岘港，但是这一场混乱的“政治战仍然远未解决”，并且担心南越还会出现“更严重政治危机”。西方通讯社还报道，华盛顿的美国官员对阮高其控制了岘港“感到松了一口气”，但是他们也不能不承认，南越傀儡集团的危机已经使美国的“声望降到了新的最低点”，目前虽然阮高其控制了岘港，只不过是一个“喘息时间”，并不能说“麻烦”已经解决了。（附图片）
