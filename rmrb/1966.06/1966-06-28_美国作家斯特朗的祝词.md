Comrades, fellow writers, and anti-imperialist fighters:

I am very happy to be able to offer a simple toast to this emergency conference in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism and in support of all other national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

I am an American. I come from the country that Sukarno of Indonesia calls the "world devil," the dark force of American imperialism that pours war all over the world. So what can I say to you?

Three things can be said as one question.

The United States is not only the home of the world devil but also the home of nearly 200 million Americans, including blacks and whites. More and more of them are turning against this world devil. And this change is brought about by Vietnam.

Vietnam is the focal point of the world struggle. It is the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people that has united the world to oppose the savage acts of the American aggressors and has united the American people to oppose their government's evil policies. It is Vietnam that has proven to the world today that even the powerful destructive force of the United States cannot conquer a small country fighting for independence.

The world and the American people are increasingly seeing that the Saigon puppet regime has collapsed, and "instability" is an incurable disease of any South Vietnamese government controlled by the United States. Every day, more and more people in Saigon, Hue, and Da Nang shout: "Yankee, get out of Vietnam!"

But it is also increasingly clear that American imperialism has no intention of withdrawing from this war but is escalating it. Johnson's loud recitation of the "peace scripture" is just a plot to extort a cheap surrender from Hanoi; even when the political center of Saigon collapses, they march into Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Their poisonous fangs are in Indonesia, and their mouths are open towards China.

In response, a broad upsurge against Johnson's war has arisen around the world, and it is recognized that American imperialism threatens every country in the world. This global upsurge is expressed at this conference of Asian and African writers. You have seen this threat to the world, and at the same time, you have seen an opportunity to unite your own two continents, which are on the front lines of the struggle. This unites you against the splitters who betray Lenin in Lenin's country and now even try to stop the revolutionary people from advancing, while they themselves seek to improve relations with the imperialists.

The upsurge against imperialism is also occurring among the American people. The voices of the American people opposing the Vietnam War, initially raised only by some radical students and pacifists, have spread widely, to the point that today not just a few hundred but thousands of writers speak out against the Vietnam War, and even conservative writers refuse the awards and medals given by President Johnson.

Comrades, writers! Our weapon is the pen, and this is an excellent weapon for rallying the support of the people of the world. We are anti-imperialist writers and know that we must participate in the great struggle of our time. We are glad to be able to meet in Beijing, because China—the country of Mao Zedong—is the beacon of the anti-imperialist struggle for all countries in the world.

Therefore, let us sharpen our pens, clean our typewriters, and actively join the battle. We will not rest until we achieve our final victory over imperialism, even if I am already eighty years old, I still hope to see this victory.

### 美国作家斯特朗的祝词

专栏：

    美国作家斯特朗的祝词作家同事们和反帝战友们：
    我很高兴能向这次支持越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争和支持所有其他亚非人民的民族解放斗争的紧急会议致一个简单的祝词。
    我是一个美国人。我来自印度尼西亚的艾地把它称之为“世界恶魔”，在世界到处倾泻战争的美帝国主义黑暗势力所在的国家。那么我对你们还有什么可说的呢？
    三件事情可以当成一个问题来讲。
    美国不仅是世界恶魔的老家，而且是将近二亿美国人民，包括黑人和白人的家园。他们之中越来越多的人转而反对这个世界恶魔。而这一变化是由越南引起的。
    越南是世界范围斗争的焦点。是越南人民的英勇抵抗使全世界团结起来，反对美国侵略者的穷凶极恶的行为，并使美国人民团结起来，反对他们政府的罪恶政策。是越南今天向全世界证明了即使是美国的强大的破坏力量，也不能征服一个为独立而战的小国。
    全世界和美国人民都日益清楚地看到西贡傀儡已经垮台，“不稳定”是任何受美国控制的南越政权的不治之症。每天，越来越多的人在西贡、顺化和岘港高呼：“美国佬，从越南滚出去”！
    但是事情也日益清楚，美帝国主义没有从这场战争中退出来的打算，而是把战争升级。约翰逊放声大念的“和平经”，只是一个赚取河内廉价地投降的阴谋；甚至当西贡的政治中心崩溃的时候，他们还向老挝、柬埔寨和泰国进军。他们的毒牙在印度尼西亚，他们的嘴巴向中国张开。
    对此，全世界的反应是掀起了反对约翰逊战争的广泛高潮，并认识到美帝国主义威胁着世界上的每一个国家。这个世界范围的高潮在这次亚非作家的会议上表达了出来。你们已经看到这种对全世界的威胁，同时也看到了一个机会来团结处于斗争前线的你们自己的两大洲。这使你们团结起来反对分裂主义者，他们在列宁的国家背叛列宁，现在甚至力图阻止革命的人民前进，而他们自己却寻求同帝国主义者改善关系。
    反对帝国主义的高潮也在美国人民之中出现了。起初只由一些激进的学生及和平主义者发出的美国人民反对越南战争的呼声，已经广泛地传播开来，以致今天不仅仅是几百名而是几千名作家出来说话反对越南战争，甚至保守的作家也拒绝了约翰逊总统颁发的奖金和勋章。
    作家同事们！我们的武器是笔杆子，而这是征集世界人民的支持的卓越武器。我们是反帝的作家，都知道我们必须参加我们时代的伟大斗争。我们很高兴能在北京聚会，因为中国——毛泽东的国家——是全世界各国在反帝斗争中的灯塔。
    因此，让我们把笔杆磨得锐利，把打字机擦干净，积极投入战斗，不取得我们对帝国主义的最后胜利，决不罢休，即使我已经八十岁了，我仍然希望看到这一胜利。
