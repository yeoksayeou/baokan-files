    Beat Back the Counter-Revolutionary Reversal
    After the Gang Members Were Exposed, They Still Intimidated the Radio Station, Forbidding the Broadcast of News Exposing Them
    Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others: Your big-character posters exposing Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun are well written, demonstrating the fearless spirit of revolutionaries. However, comrades, the enemy has not surrendered! On the evening of the first day of the month, during the Central People's Broadcasting Station's "Regional Radio Stations Joint Broadcast Program," when broadcasting the revolutionary and militant big-character posters of seven comrades including Nie Yuanzi, the editorial department constantly received questioning phone calls from rightists at Peking University. They questioned the editorial department aggressively: Who allowed you to broadcast this big-character poster?
    In a situation where the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" has already been destroyed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the bosses of Peking University, acting as a branch of the "Three-Family Village's" black den, have not bowed their heads in confession to the people. They are still putting up a desperate resistance. If the enemy does not surrender, then eliminate them. Comrades, you have already fired the first shot. We hope that you will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue your efforts, and advance victoriously! Do not withdraw your troops until the "Three-Family Village's" black den, this branch, is completely destroyed. Victory will surely belong to you! Because you have the support of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals. As broadcasting workers, we firmly support you. We will broadcast your revolutionary big-character posters and your revolutionary voices loudly throughout the country. Truth belongs to you, and to all revolutionaries. Truth will surely prevail. All mantises trying to stop the chariot, all ants trying to shake the tree, will inevitably be crushed by the wheels of the revolution!
    We are watching you, waiting for your victorious news. Fearless proletarian revolutionaries! Six hundred and fifty million people are watching you, waiting for your victorious news! Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionaries!

    打退反革命的反扑
    黑帮分子被揪出后，仍然恫吓电台，不许广播揭露他们的消息
    聂元梓等同志：你们揭露宋硕、陆平、彭珮云的大字报贴得好，表现了革命者的大无畏精神。但是，同学们，敌人并没有投降！在中央人民广播电台一日晚上“各地电台联播节目”时间，播送聂元梓等七位同志的革命的战斗的大字报时，编辑部曾经不断接到北大右派打来的质问的电话，他们气势汹汹地质问编辑部：谁让你们播这张大字报？
    在反党反社会主义的“三家村”已经被广大工农兵群众捣毁的情况下，做为“三家村”黑店的一个支店的北京大学的老板们，并没有向人民低头认罪，他们还在负隅顽抗。敌人不投降，那就消灭他。同学们，你们已经打响了第一炮，希望你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，乘胜前进！不彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店这个支店，决不收兵。胜利一定属于你们！因为你们有党中央和毛主席的支持，有广大工农兵群众和革命知识分子的支持。做为广播工作者，我们坚决支持你们，我们要响亮地向全国播送你们革命的大字报，播送你们革命的声音。真理属于你们，属于一切革命者。真理一定胜利。一切企图挡车的螳螂，一切企图撼树的蚍蜉，必将为革命的车轮碾碎！
    我们注视着你们，等待着你们胜利的消息。大无畏的无产阶级革命派们！六亿五千万人民在注视着你们，在等待着你们胜利的消息！胜利一定属于无产阶级革命派！中央人民广播电台工作人员、北京大学毕业生
                            吴志成等十三人
