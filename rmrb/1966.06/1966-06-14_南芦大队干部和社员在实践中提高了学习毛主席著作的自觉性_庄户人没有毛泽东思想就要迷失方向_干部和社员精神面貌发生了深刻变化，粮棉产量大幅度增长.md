    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th -- The Nanlu Brigade of Liu Village Commune in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, is a production brigade notable for its cadres and commune members' flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's works. In this brigade, many commune members even bring Chairman Mao's works to the fields when they go to work during the day, and during breaks, they gather in groups of three or five to read. At night, people studying Chairman Mao's works can be found everywhere in the village. Over the past year or so, because they have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well, the spiritual outlook of the cadres and commune members throughout the brigade has undergone profound changes, and the production of grain and cotton has also increased significantly.
        
        The Party Branch Secretary Takes the Lead in Studying

    Guo Yutian, the Party Branch Secretary of the Nanlu Brigade, began studying Chairman Mao's works in 1964. He not only studies diligently but is also good at flexible study and application. However, before that, he did not know the benefits of studying Chairman Mao's works, and sometimes when he read them, he did not gain much. In 1964, he listened to a report by Zhou Mingshan (currently the Secretary of the Jiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party) on how the Party Branch of the Nanliu Brigade of the Nanfan Commune in Jiang County used Mao Zedong Thought to command their work, and his thinking was enlightened. The very night he returned, he opened Chairman Mao's book under the lamplight. When he read Chairman Mao's words in the article "Study and the Current Situation," which said, "There are many things which can become a burden and a load to us if we fall into blindness and lack consciousness about them," he couldn't help but reflect on why he had been standing still for the past few years and why the work of the entire branch had not improved much. He thought, isn't this precisely because he had burdens in his thinking and loads on his spirit?

    Guo Yutian used to think that the "revolution had come to an end." He always thought that he was an old cadre who had participated in the revolution for many years, who had led everyone in fighting landlords, and who had been at the forefront during agricultural collectivization. He thought he had contributed labor if not merit. "The revolution has finally come to an end." Therefore, he lacked the ambition to transform the world.

    In order to find out the reasons and transform his thinking, Guo Yutian read Chairman Mao's books every night and repeatedly thought about his own problems. He saw Chairman Mao say: "Because of victory, pride, the mentality of claiming credit, the mentality of stagnation and unwillingness to make progress, and the mentality of greed for pleasure and unwillingness to live a hard life may grow within the Party." "To win country-wide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li." He felt that Chairman Mao's words hit him right in the heart. He thought that his family had worked as long-term laborers for landlords for generations, and before liberation, he lived a life where his clothes did not cover his body and he did not have enough to eat. His father joined the Red Army to help the poor turn over and live a good life. Thinking of this, he told himself to firmly remember the bitterness of class, never forget class struggle, and to transform his thinking, have the world in his heart, continuously make revolution, and continuously advance in order to realize communism in our country and the world. He must never lie on the "old capital" of the revolution and fall asleep.

    He persisted in reading Chairman Mao's books, constantly examined his thinking, and gradually, he improved his ideological awareness and strengthened his consciousness of the socialist revolution. He often had heart-to-heart talks with Party members and cadres in the fields and on the kang, conducting meticulous ideological work in response to their active thoughts. He also often went to the homes of commune members, asking about their well-being. In the past, he did not put in enough effort in leading production, but now he goes all out to take the lead. Every morning before dawn, he gets up and goes out alone with a manure basket to collect manure. Last winter alone, he collected more than 1,000 jin of dry manure for the collective. During the most intense days of the anti-drought struggle, he rolled in the mud and climbed in the soil with the commune members during the day and discussed plans to fight the heavens with the cadres at night. Mao Zedong Thought has transformed Guo Yutian's subjective world.

        Using Mao Zedong Thought to Improve the Party Branch's Fighting Power

    Guo Yutian not only worked hard to flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works himself, but also paid attention to arming every Party member with Mao Zedong Thought, so that the Nanlu Brigade Party Branch could become a strong fighting fortress.

    Ma Yongxiang, the Party Branch's Propaganda Committee member, had excellent carpentry skills. In the past, he was not at ease with collective production, and sometimes he carried his tools outside to do odd jobs, paying little attention to the affairs of the production brigade. After the Party Branch discovered this situation, it helped him study Chairman Mao's relevant works to raise his ideological awareness. Ma Yongxiang came from a very poor background and learned carpentry at a young age, enduring the torment and humiliation of the shop owner. Guo Yutian repeatedly had individual talks with him to help him raise his class consciousness. He said to Ma Yongxiang earnestly: "Old Ma, we must not forget the bitter life of the old society. If we only seek personal prosperity and wealth, then we will have to return to the old road of the old society. Such crooked ways must never be taken. We are also Communist Party members, and the masses are watching us." Under the patient enlightenment of the Party Branch, Ma Yongxiang finally changed. He took the initiative to request to be stationed at the mill, where he worked very well, leading the mill workers to flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works while guiding them to carry out technological innovations. Since last year, this mill has saved the brigade more than 3,000 yuan and has transformed from a backward unit into an advanced unit.

    The Party Branch also used the method of rectification to organize Party members and cadres to successively study Chairman Mao's works such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Unite the Entire Party and Fight to Accomplish Its Tasks," and "On Strengthening the Party Committee System," learning and discussing them together. Everyone realized the importance of doing a good job in unity, resolved the contradictions between new and old cadres, and strengthened unity within the Party.

    In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, the ideological awareness of Party members has been constantly improving. On this basis, they adhered to three systems: First, the system of studying Chairman Mao's works. All Party members collectively study six times a month during the slack season. Whenever a study day comes, regardless of whether it is windy, rainy, or snowy, they gather on time for study without fail. Second, the system of Party members contacting the masses by household. According to the activity ability and living conditions of each Party member, they are assigned to contact commune members, often visiting the homes of the masses to ask about their well-being, solve their difficulties, and make close friends. Third, the system of adhering to criticism and self-criticism within the Party. Party members regularly conduct organizational life, criticizing and correcting all words and deeds that do not conform to the interests of the Party and the masses. In this way, the Party Branch has played the role of a fighting fortress, and the revolutionary righteousness in the brigade has been greatly promoted, while unhealthy tendencies have disappeared.

        Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm the Broad Masses of Commune Members

    While grasping the ideological revolutionization of Party members, the Nanlu Brigade Party Branch guided the broad masses of commune members to flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds. The Party Branch first strengthened class education for young people, organizing them to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and conducting discussions in light of the actual class struggle in the brigade. They also had some poor and lower-middle peasants who had suffered greatly in the past regularly tell the young people about their history of blood and tears. The brigade's club drew more than 180 pictures reflecting the tragic experiences of the people of Nanlu before liberation and posted them in the cultural room. After receiving vivid class education, the young people expressed their determination to keep class hatred in their hearts, never forget their roots, and make revolution forever.

    Wang Qinghai, a descendant of an old poor peasant, was not performing well, so the brigade club adapted a play based on Wang Qinghai's family history called "Old Wang Watching the Tomb." It turned out that Wang Qinghai's father worked as a long-term laborer before liberation, and because he could not repay the landlord's debts, he was forced to watch the landlord's tomb, and he could not leave the landlord's cemetery until he died. When this play was performed, Wang Qinghai and many poor and lower-middle peasants watched and cried. The Party Branch also had individual talks with Wang Qinghai to help him study Chairman Mao's works and educate him to stand firm, draw a clear line between classes, and be a revolutionary descendant of poor and lower-middle peasants. From then on, Wang Qinghai changed. He actively participated in collective productive labor, exemplarily safeguarded collective interests, and was rated as a "Five-Good" commune member last year.

    In order to help the broad masses of commune members consciously transform their thinking, the Nanlu Brigade organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and the editor's note to "Who Says Chicken Feathers Cannot Fly to Heaven." In the study, many commune members used the revolutionary spirit of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, who were completely selfless and dedicated to benefiting others, as a mirror to examine themselves, and resolved to abandon all selfish ideas and transform themselves into new-type peasants of the Mao Zedong era with a high degree of socialist consciousness.

    The Nanlu Brigade Party Branch promptly publicized and commended the good people and good deeds that emerged in the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's works, creating a strong atmosphere for studying Chairman Mao's works. Last year alone, the Party Branch commended more than 140 good people and good deeds who learned and applied even a little bit. Now, 80% of the commune members in the entire brigade participate in Chairman Mao's works study groups, regularly studying Chairman Mao's works. The entire brigade now has more than 1,000 single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, and almost every household has a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong." Last year, more than 80 commune members wrote study心得. Many commune members have become activists in studying Chairman Mao's works. They say: "Flowers cannot bloom without rain and dew, and peasants will lose their way without Mao Zedong Thought!"

### 南芦大队干部和社员在实践中提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性  “庄户人没有毛泽东思想就要迷失方向”  干部和社员精神面貌发生了深刻变化，粮棉产量大幅度增长

    南芦大队干部和社员在实践中提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性
    “庄户人没有毛泽东思想就要迷失方向”
    干部和社员精神面貌发生了深刻变化，粮棉产量大幅度增长
    新华社太原十三日电　山西省临汾县刘村公社南芦大队是一个干部、社员活学活用毛主席著作很突出的生产大队。这个大队，有不少社员白天下地干活，也带着毛主席著作，休息的时候，就三五成群地在田头读起来。晚上，全村到处是学习毛主席著作的人。最近一年多来，由于对毛主席著作学得好用得好，全大队干部、社员精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，粮、棉产量也大幅度增长。
        党支部书记带头学
    南芦大队党支部书记郭玉田，从一九六四年开始学习毛主席著作，不但学得认真，而且善于活学活用。可是，在这以前，他并不知道学习毛主席著作的好处，有时读一些，收获也不大。一九六四年，他听了周明山（现任中共绛县委员会书记）作的关于绛县南樊公社南柳大队党支部用毛泽东思想统帅工作的报告，思想才开了窍。回来的当天晚上，他就在灯光下打开了毛主席的书。当读到毛主席在《学习和时局》一文中说的“有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担”时，他不禁思索起自己这几年裹足不前，整个支部工作起色不大的原因来。他想，这不正是因为自己思想上有包袱，精神上有负担吗？
    郭玉田过去认为“革命到头”了。他总以为自己是参加革命多年的老干部，领导大伙斗过地主，农业合作化时又走在人家头里，没有功劳也有点苦劳。“革命总算到了头。”因此，缺乏改天换地的雄心壮志。
    为了查清原因，改造思想，郭玉田天天夜里读毛主席的书，一次又一次地想自己的问题。他看到了毛主席说的这样的话：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”他觉得，毛主席的这些话，字字句句打在他的心坎上。他想，自己一家祖祖辈辈为地主扛长工，解放前，自己过着衣不遮体、食不饱腹的生活，父亲为了穷人翻身过好日子，参加了红军。想到这里，他叮嘱自己要牢牢记住阶级苦，时时不忘阶级斗争，为了在我国和全世界实现共产主义，一定要改造思想，胸怀世界，不断革命，不断前进，决不能躺在革命的“老本”上睡大觉。
    他坚持不懈地读毛主席的书，经常检查思想，渐渐地，他提高了思想觉悟，社会主义革命的自觉性增强了。他经常在田头、炕头与党员干部促膝谈心，针对他们的活思想进行细致的思想工作；还经常到社员家里，问暖问寒。过去，他领导生产不出劲，现在他豁出全力带头干。每天清早天不亮，他就起床，背着粪筐独个儿出去拾粪，去年一个冬天就给集体拾了一千多斤干粪。在抗旱斗争最紧张的日子里，他白天和社员一起泥里滚、土里爬，黑夜与干部共商抗天大计。毛泽东思想使郭玉田的主观世界换了个新的天地。
      用毛泽东思想提高党支部战斗力
    郭玉田不光自己努力活学活用毛主席著作，也注意用毛泽东思想武装每一个党员，使南芦大队党支部成为一个坚强的战斗堡垒。
    党支部宣传委员马永祥有一手出色的木匠手艺。过去，他不安心集体生产，有时候背着工具到外面去干零活，对生产大队的事情过问得很少。党支部发现这种情况以后，就帮助他学习毛主席的有关著作，提高他的思想觉悟。马永祥出身很苦，很小起就学木匠活，受尽了店主的折磨和凌辱。郭玉田就多次找他个别谈话，帮助他提高阶级觉悟。他语重心长地对马永祥说：“老马啊，旧社会的苦难生活我们不能忘记，如果只图个人兴旺发家，那就要回到旧社会的老路上去，这样的歪门邪道可万万走不得，咱们又是共产党员，群众的眼睛都看着我们。”在党支部的耐心启发下，马永祥终于转变了。他主动要求到磨坊场去蹲点，在那里，他干得很出色，一边带动磨坊工人活学活用毛主席著作，一边引导他们进行技术革新。去年以来，这个磨坊场为大队节省了三千多元，由落后单位变成了一个先进单位。
    这个大队党支部又用整风的方法，组织党员干部先后学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《整顿党的作风》、《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》、《关于健全党委制》等著作，边学边讨论，大伙认识了搞好团结的重要意义，解决了新老干部之间的矛盾，增强了党内团结。
    在学习毛主席著作过程中，党员的思想觉悟不断提高。在这个基础上，他们坚持了三种制度：一是毛主席著作学习制度。全体党员农闲时每月集体学习六次，逢到学习日，不管刮风下雨下雪，他们都按时集合起来学习，雷打不散。二是党员分户联系群众的制度。根据每个党员的活动能力和居住条件，分工联系社员，经常到群众家里问寒问暖，解决困难，交知心朋友。三是坚持党内批评和自我批评的制度。党员定期过组织生活，对一切不符合党和群众利益的言行进行批评和纠正。这样，党支部便发挥了战斗堡垒作用，大队里革命正气大大伸张，歪风邪气消声匿迹。
        用毛泽东思想武装广大社员
    南芦大队党支部在抓党员思想革命化的同时，引导广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑。党支部首先对青年加强阶级教育，组织青年学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》等文章，结合本大队的阶级斗争实际进行讨论。又让一些苦大仇深的贫农下中农经常给青年讲血泪史。大队俱乐部绘制了一百八十多幅反映南芦人解放前悲惨遭遇的图片，张贴在文化室里。青年人受了生动的阶级教育，纷纷表示要把阶级仇恨记在心上，永不忘本，永远革命。
    老贫农的后代王青海表现不好，大队俱乐部就根据王青海的家史编了一出戏，叫《老王看坟》。原来，王青海父亲解放前扛长工，因为还不清地主的债，逼得给地主看坟，直到死的时候也没能离开地主家的坟场。这出戏演出的时候，王青海和许多贫农下中农一面看，一面哭泣。党支部又找王青海个别谈心，帮助他学习毛主席著作，教育他要站稳立场，划清阶级界限，做贫农下中农的革命后代。从此，王青海转变了。他积极参加集体生产劳动，模范地维护集体利益，在去年评为“五好”社员。
    为了帮助广大社员自觉地改造思想，南芦大队组织社员们学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文按语。在学习中，不少社员以张思德、白求恩的毫不利己专门利人的革命精神为镜子，对照检查了自己，决心要抛掉一切私心杂念，把自己锻炼成具有高度社会主义觉悟的毛泽东时代的新型农民。
    南芦大队党支部对活学活用毛主席著作中出现的好人好事，都及时地进行宣传和表扬，把学习毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的。单是去年一年，党支部表扬的学一点用一点的好人好事就有一百四十多件。现在，全大队的社员有百分之八十参加毛主席著作学习小组，经常地学习毛主席著作。全大队现有毛主席著作单行本一千多本，差不多每户有一套《毛泽东选集》或《毛泽东著作选读》。去年，有八十多个社员写了学习心得。许多社员成了毛主席著作学习积极分子。他们说：“鲜花没有雨露不能开放，庄户人没有毛泽东思想就要迷失方向！”
