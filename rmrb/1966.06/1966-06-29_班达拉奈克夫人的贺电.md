To the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing:

I am very pleased to join the distinguished Asian and African writers in extending my warmest congratulations to the 1966 June Conference of Asian and African Writers for its success in supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people for independence, sovereignty, and the reunification of their country.

I also take this opportunity to condemn the United States for its aggression against Vietnam in violation of the Geneva Accords.

I feel particularly honored that this conference is convened by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers stationed in Ceylon.

Victory to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people!
