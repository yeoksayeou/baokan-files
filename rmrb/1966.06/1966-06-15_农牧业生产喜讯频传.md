    Good News Frequently Reported in Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production
    Hainan Island Achieves Bumper Harvest on Over Two Million Mu of Early Rice
    Hainan Island's 2.4 million mu of early rice has achieved another bumper harvest this year. Based on the actual harvesting and threshing in most areas so far, the total output has increased compared to last year's record. Since 1963, Hainan Island's total early rice output has increased by more than 20% each year. On the basis of continuous increases over the years, another increase has been achieved this year.
    Many commune members are full of joy and say that this is the fruitful result of emphasizing politics, emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, and turning spirit into matter. In the past few years, although Hainan Island had continuous increases, the increase in some low-yield areas was relatively small. At that time, some people believed, "These low-yield areas have poor water conservancy conditions and little fertilizer, so there is no way to quickly turn them around." This spring, in the political and professional relationship debate carried out throughout the district, people had a heated discussion on where the root of low yields lies. After fully presenting the facts and reasoning, everyone unanimously realized that poor water and poor fertilizer are not the worst, not emphasizing politics and not revolutionizing thinking are the most terrible. The root of low yields lies here. After improving their ideological understanding, leaders at all levels went deep into low-yield areas to stay, emphasizing politics and establishing models. At the same time, they fully exercised production democracy, fully concentrated the wisdom of the masses, and fully attached importance to summarizing and promoting local experience in increasing production.
    Corn Grows Sturdily in Mountainous Areas of Hubei
    Eight million mu of corn in the mountainous areas of Hubei are generally growing sturdily, and the earlier sown crops have begun to tassel.
    The mountainous area of Hubei accounts for more than half of the province's total area. In the past, many areas did not pay enough attention to corn production, and the yield per mu was only a little over one hundred jin. Some cadres and commune members had the illusion that corn was a low-yield crop, and whether or not it was emphasized was irrelevant to the overall situation. Only by developing rice production could the grain problem in mountainous areas be solved.
    In response to this idea, last year, twenty mountainous counties in western Hubei Province comprehensively investigated the corn production situation and educated cadres and the masses with the advanced experience of large-scale, high-yield corn production in advanced areas, making everyone realize that the development of corn production must be placed at the top of grain production in mountainous areas.
    Good Harvest in Sight for Animal Husbandry in Inner Mongolia
    The spring lambing season in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered its final stage. By the end of May, the entire autonomous region had raised 7.6 million live calves, foals, lambs, and camel calves. Another 60% of large livestock dams and about 15% of pregnant ewes are still giving birth successively. At present, the weather is warming up, pastures are turning green, and the survival rate of young livestock has further improved. The autonomous region's animal husbandry is expected to achieve a relatively good harvest.
    The achievements made on the animal husbandry front of the autonomous region were achieved after farmers and herdsmen of all nationalities held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and overcame severe snowstorms and droughts. In the past year, many areas in Inner Mongolia were threatened by drought. After entering the 1966 animal husbandry year, the drought situation in these areas continued to develop. After winter, there were several consecutive strong winds, and some pastoral areas in the eastern region also experienced severe snow disasters. In the face of these disasters, could continuous increases in livestock production be guaranteed? The vast number of cadres and the masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, gave a firm answer to this question: It all depends on human effort. We have the leadership of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and no difficulty can overwhelm us. A bumper harvest of young livestock and the development of animal husbandry all depend on our own hands!
    Liaoning Transfers Agricultural Machinery to Support Other Areas
    The workers in Liaoning Province's agricultural machinery industry, ahead of the farming season, transported a large number of agricultural machinery needed for this year's summer harvest and summer planting to more than twenty provinces and autonomous regions across the country. More than 98,000 sets of irrigation and drainage equipment, hand-held tractors, animal-powered paddy field weeders, sprayers, and other mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural machinery have been transported to Yunnan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and other places. At the same time, Liaoning also transported more than 1.6 million agricultural machinery parts to various places.
    Liaoning's agricultural machinery industry is undertaking a heavier task of supporting the summer harvest and summer planting this year than last year, and the time requirements are also very urgent. However, the vast number of workers have launched a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, inspiring the revolutionary spirit of daring to shoulder heavy burdens and daring to overcome difficulties, and have also carried out technical innovation and technical revolution activities, thus ensuring the timely completion of production tasks and catching up ahead of the farming season.
    Large Quantities of Summer Harvest and Summer Planting Farm Tools Go to the Countryside in Jiangsu
    Farm tool factories and cooperatives in Jiangsu's handicraft industry system have rushed to produce more than 6 million sickles for rural areas this year, as well as more than 100,000 sets of rice and wheat dual-purpose threshers, cultivators, improved paddy field harrows, agricultural water pumps, closed waterwheels, and seedling transplanters, which are now mostly transported to production teams.
    This year, farm tool factories and cooperatives in the handicraft industry in various parts of Jiangsu also generally organized mobile service teams, taking Mao Zedong's works, luggage, tools, and accessories, going deep into villages and fields, taking materials locally, repairing locally, and manufacturing locally, providing more direct services to agricultural production, and were welcomed by the vast number of commune members in rural areas.

### 农牧业生产喜讯频传

    农牧业生产喜讯频传
    海南岛二百多万亩早稻丰收
    海南岛二百四十万亩早稻今年又获得了丰收。根据目前大部分地区实收实打的情况来看，总产量比创纪录的去年增产。从一九六三年起，海南岛早稻总产量每年都递增两成以上。在连年持续增产的基础上，今年又获增产。
    许多社员都满怀喜悦地说，这是突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，精神变物质结出来的硕果。前几年，海南岛虽然连年增产，但总有一部分低产地区增产幅度较小。当时有些人认为，“这些低产地区水利条件差，肥料也少，没办法迅速翻身。”今年春天，在全区开展的政治与业务关系的大辩论中，人们对低产的根子究竟在哪里开展了一场热烈的争论。经过充分摆事实，讲道理，大家一致认识到：水差肥差不算差，不突出政治，思想不革命化最可怕，低产的根子也就在这里。思想认识提高以后，各级领导就深入低产地区蹲点，突出政治，大办样板。同时，充分发挥生产民主，充分集中群众智慧，充分重视总结和推广本地的增产经验。
    湖北山区玉米生长茁壮
    湖北山区八百万亩玉米普遍生长茁壮，播种较早的已经开始扬花。
    湖北山区面积约占全省总面积一半以上。过去，不少地区对玉米生产不重视，亩产只有一百多斤。一部分干部和社员便产生了错觉，认为玉米是低产作物，抓不抓无关大局，只有发展水稻生产才是解决山区粮食问题的出路。
    针对这种思想，去年湖北省西部二十个山区县全面调查了玉米生产情况，用先进地区玉米大面积高产的先进经验教育干部和群众，使大家认识到：必须把发展玉米生产摆在山区粮食生产的首位。
    内蒙古畜牧业好收成在望
    内蒙古自治区春羔接产进入最后阶段。到五月底，全自治区育活的牛犊、马驹和羊羔、驼羔已达七百六十万头，还有百分之六十的大家畜母畜和百分之十五左右的怀胎母羊正在陆续产仔。目前天气转暖，牧草返青，仔畜成活率有了进一步提高，自治区的畜牧业可望获得一个较好的收成。
    自治区畜牧业战线上取得的成就，是在各民族农牧民高举毛泽东思想红旗，战胜了严重的风雪和干旱灾害后取得的。在过去一年里，内蒙古有许多地区遭到干旱的威胁。进入一九六六年畜牧业年度后，这些地区的旱情仍在继续发展。入冬后又连续刮了几次大风，东部地区部分牧区还发生了严重雪灾。在这些灾害面前能不能保证牲畜连续增产，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大干部和群众对这个问题作了坚定的回答：事在人为，我们有党的领导，有毛泽东思想为武器，多大的困难也难不倒我们。仔畜要丰收，牧业要发展，全靠我们一双手！
    辽宁调运农业机械支援外地
    辽宁省农业机械行业职工赶在农时前面，把今年夏收夏种需要的大批农业机械，提前运往全国二十多个省和自治区。有九万八千多部排灌设备、手扶拖拉机、畜力水田除草器和喷雾器等机械化半机械化农机具，已经运往云南、广东、浙江、湖南、山西和新疆等地。在这同时，辽宁还为各地运出了一百六十多万件农机配件。
    辽宁农机行业今年承担的支援夏收夏种的任务比去年重，时间要求也很紧迫。但是，广大职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，振奋了勇于挑重担、勇于克服困难的革命精神，并且开展了技术革新和技术革命活动，因而保证了生产任务的及时完成，赶到了农时季节的前面。
    江苏大批夏收夏种农具下乡
    江苏手工业系统农具厂社今年为农村赶制的六百多万把镰刀和为各地赶制的十万多部稻麦两用脱粒机、中耕器、改良水田耙、农用水泵、封闭式水车和移苗器等夏收夏种工具，现在大部分已运往生产队。
    江苏各地手工业农具厂社今年还普遍组织了流动服务队，带着毛主席著作，带着行李、工具和配件，深入村庄和田头，就地取材，就地修理，就地制造，更直接地为农业生产服务，受到了农村广大社员的欢迎。
