    A former puppet regime "Premier" of Congo (Leopoldville), Kimba, and three others were executed by the Mobutu puppet regime after a failed coup. This is a scuffle between U.S. and Belgian imperialism, a manifestation of the intensified contradictions between new and old colonialism.
    Ever since U.S. imperialism, under the banner of the United Nations, invaded Congo (Leopoldville), the struggle of exclusion and counter-exclusion between U.S. neo-colonialism and Belgian old colonialists has become increasingly acute. In previous years, the "UN forces" manipulated by U.S. imperialism even clashed with the Tshombe puppets supported by Belgium, Britain, and France in Katanga, vying for control of Katanga's rich mineral deposits. After that, Adoula, Tshombe, Kasavubu, Kimba, and Mobutu changed like a revolving lantern. This time, the execution of Kimba and others, backed by Belgian old colonialism, was entirely orchestrated by U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism attempts to use this to divert the anti-American sentiment of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people, further weaken and strike at Belgian colonial forces, and stabilize Washington's neo-colonial rule. This shows that imperialism is united in suppressing the people; however, when it comes to their mutual interests, their contradictions are irreconcilable.
    For the people of Congo (Leopoldville), Kimba and Mobutu are both running dogs of imperialism. The people of Congo (Leopoldville) must not only overthrow the old colonialism and its running dogs but also overthrow U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The people of Congo (Leopoldville) clearly understand that as long as they rely on their own patriotic armed forces and persist in revolutionary armed struggle, they will eventually be able to overthrow the enslavement rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and achieve the independence and liberation of their motherland.

### 新老殖民主义的一场厮杀

    新老殖民主义的一场厮杀
    刚果（利）前傀儡政权“总理”金巴等四人，由于发动政变失败，被蒙博托傀儡政权绞死了。这是美、比帝国主义之间的一场厮杀，是新老殖民主义之间矛盾尖锐化的一种表现。
    自从美帝国主义打着联合国的旗号侵入刚果（利）以来，美国新殖民主义和比利时老殖民主义者之间排挤反排挤的斗争，日趋尖锐。前几年，美帝国主义操纵下的“联合国军”甚至同比、英、法在加丹加扶植的冲伯傀儡发生火并，争夺对加丹加富饶矿藏的控制权。在这之后，阿杜拉、冲伯、卡萨武布、金巴、蒙博托等象走马灯一样换来换去。这一次以比利时老殖民主义为后台老板的金巴等人被绞死，完全是出于美帝国主义的策划。美帝国主义企图借此转移刚果（利）人民的反美情绪，进一步削弱和打击比利时的殖民势力，以稳定华盛顿的新殖民统治。这表明，帝国主义在镇压人民这一点上是一致的；但是，当涉及彼此之间的利害关系时，它们之间的矛盾，却是不可调和的。
    对于刚果（利）人民来说，金巴和蒙博托都是帝国主义的走狗。刚果（利）人民不仅要打倒老殖民主义及其走狗，更要打倒美帝国主义及其走狗。刚果（利）人民清楚地懂得，只要依靠自己的爱国武装力量，坚持革命武装斗争，他们最后一定能够推翻美帝国主义及其走狗的奴役统治，取得祖国的独立和解放。
