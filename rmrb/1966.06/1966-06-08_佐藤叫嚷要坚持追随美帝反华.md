    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th: Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato clamored once again on June 6th during a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, insisting that the Japanese government would continue to pursue the reactionary policy of following US imperialism and being hostile to China.

    According to reports, during the June 6th meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Socialist Party Congressman Yoshio Katsuzawa, when questioning the China issue, pointed out that Japan should not pursue a foreign policy subordinate to the United States but should pursue a more independent foreign policy.

    Sato stubbornly claimed that at the United Nations General Assembly to be held this autumn, Japan would continue to follow US imperialism in playing the so-called "important matter" method to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He clamored that the Japanese government "has so far not, and does not need to change, its consistent basic attitude (on this issue)."

    In order to cover up his reactionary anti-China face, Sato, in his reply, rehashed the bankrupt principle of so-called "separation of politics and economics," shamelessly attributing all the achievements made in trade and cultural exchanges through the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people to himself. He said that the Japanese government "is carrying out trade and cultural exchanges with the CCP under the principle of separation of politics and economics," and "although (the two countries) do not have diplomatic relations," "in terms of trade," it is estimated that this year will be "larger" than last year.

    佐藤叫嚷要坚持追随美帝反华
    据新华社东京七日电　日本首相佐藤荣作六日在众议院决算委员会上答辩时，再次叫嚷日本政府要坚持推行追随美帝国主义、敌视中国的反动政策。
    据报道，在众议院决算委员会六日的会议上，社会党国会议员胜泽芳雄就中国问题提出质询时指出，日本不应当推行从属于美国的外交政策，而应当推行更加自主的外交。
    佐藤顽固地声称，在今年秋天举行的联合国大会上日本仍将继续追随美帝国主义玩弄所谓“重要事项”方式，来阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。他叫嚷日本政府“到目前为止，不会和没有必要改变（在这个问题上的）一贯的基本态度”。
    佐藤为了掩盖他敌视中国的反动面目，在答辩时重新搬出早已破了产的所谓“政治与经济分离”的原则，恬不知耻地把中日两国人民经过共同努力在贸易和文化交流上所取得的成就，统统算在自己的账上。他说什么日本政府“同中共在政治与经济分离的原则下，正在开展贸易和文化交流”，“虽然（两国）没有外交关系”，但是“在贸易方面”，估计今年要比去年“扩大”。
