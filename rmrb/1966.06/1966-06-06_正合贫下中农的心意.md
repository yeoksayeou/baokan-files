    The former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, for a long time, was waving the red flag while opposing the red flag, gathering a bunch of demons and monsters to viciously curse our great Party, attack great socialism, and attempt to restore capitalism, allowing landlords and capitalists to ride on our backs again. We resolutely oppose this. The Party Central Committee's wise decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee completely suits the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we firmly support it. We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings on classes and class struggle, resolutely and thoroughly defeat all demons and monsters, and struggle to the end for the complete realization of socialism and great communism in our country.

    正合贫下中农的心意
    前北京市委长期以来打着红旗反红旗，纠集一伙牛鬼蛇神恶毒地咒骂我们伟大的党，攻击伟大的社会主义，企图复辟资本主义，让地主资本家重新骑在我们头上，我们坚决反对。党中央关于改组北京市委的英明决定，完全符合我们贫农下中农的心意，我们坚决拥护。我们永远记住毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，坚决彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神，为在我国彻底实现社会主义和伟大的共产主义而奋斗到底。
