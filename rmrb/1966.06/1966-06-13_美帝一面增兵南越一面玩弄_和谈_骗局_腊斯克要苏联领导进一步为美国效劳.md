　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th - U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and Secretary of State Rusk announced at a joint press conference on the 11th that the U.S. government will continue to increase troops in South Vietnam on the one hand, and continue to play the "peace talk" deception on the other, attempting to use this to salvage the defeat in the Vietnam War. This press conference was held after McNamara and Rusk reported to U.S. President Johnson and congressional leaders of both parties on the situation in South Vietnam and other issues. McNamara announced that the Johnson administration has approved sending another 18,000 U.S. troops to South Vietnam in the coming weeks, thereby increasing the number of U.S. troops invading Vietnam to 285,000. The U.S. currently has 267,000 invading troops in South Vietnam. McNamara also clamored that the U.S. will "continue to increase our troops" in the future.
　　McNamara's words show that the "dry season offensive" launched by the U.S. invading forces in South Vietnam has suffered a disastrous defeat, and the Johnson administration is trying to support the losing situation by further increasing the stakes. U.S. newspapers also continue to report that, in order to launch a new "offensive," the Johnson administration is preparing to increase the number of U.S. troops invading Vietnam by 100,000, bringing the total to nearly 400,000. But the more bets Johnson puts in, the more miserably he loses.
　　Rusk played the role of the white-faced character in his speech. He said that the U.S. wants to continue to seek a "peaceful" solution to the Vietnam issue. Rusk particularly requested the Soviet revisionist clique to further help the U.S. realize Johnson's "peace talk" deception in this regard. He bluntly said that the Soviet leaders should "take action and help us achieve some kind of peace over there." He also said that the Soviet leaders had said that "the Geneva peacekeeping mechanism is the only suitable place" for resolving the Vietnam issue. If so, the U.S. believes "then let us use the Geneva machinery." The U.S. is prepared to "formally or informally use the Geneva peacekeeping mechanism to seek a solution to this war."
　　Rusk also revealed the U.S.'s conspiracy to further use the United Nations to serve the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the U.S. still hopes that the United Nations will send "observers" to "observe" the "elections" to be held in September by the South Vietnamese puppet clique directed by the U.S. According to reports, the President of the United Nations Security Council, New Zealand representative Corner, said on the 10th that he had consulted with the Security Council members to study the U.S.'s earlier proposal to send UN "observers" to South Vietnam. Corner said that the U.S. also suggested that if the Security Council does not agree to send "observers," the U.S. advocates that "observers" be sent to South Vietnam by the UN "Human Rights Commission." U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg said on the 6th that the U.S. also advocates that "members of the International Supervisory Commission or the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference... act as UN observers."

### 美帝一面增兵南越一面玩弄“和谈”骗局  腊斯克要苏联领导进一步为美国效劳

    美帝一面增兵南越一面玩弄“和谈”骗局
    腊斯克要苏联领导进一步为美国效劳
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和国务卿腊斯克十一日在一个联合记者招待会宣布，美国政府将一方面继续增兵南越，另一方面继续玩弄“和谈”骗局，企图借此挽救侵越战争的败局。这个记者招待会是麦克纳马拉和腊斯克就南越局势等问题向美国总统约翰逊和国会两党领袖作汇报后举行的。麦克纳马拉宣布，约翰逊政府已批准在未来几星期中再派一万八千名美军到南越去，从而使侵越美军增加到二十八万五千人。美国目前在南越的侵略军共有二十六万七千人。麦克纳马拉还叫嚷，美国今后还“会继续增加我们的部队”。
    麦克纳马拉的话表明，美国侵略军在南越发动的“旱季攻势”遭到了惨败，约翰逊政府正力图用进一步增加赌注的办法来撑持败局。美国报刊还不断传出消息说，为了发动新的“攻势”，约翰逊政府正准备把侵越美军增加十万人，使总数接近四十万。但是约翰逊投入的赌注越大，就输得越惨。
    腊斯克在发言时扮演了唱白脸的角色。他说什么美国要继续谋求越南问题的“和平”解决。腊斯克在这方面特别要求苏联修正主义集团进一步帮忙美国实现约翰逊的“和谈”骗局。他露骨地说，苏联领导人应当“行动起来，动手帮忙我们在那边取得某种和平”。他还说，苏联领导人曾说关于解决越南问题“日内瓦维持和平机构是唯一合适的场所”，如果是这样，美国认为“那就让我们使用日内瓦的机器好了”。美国准备“正式地或非正式地利用日内瓦维持和平机构来谋求解决这场战争”。
    腊斯克还透露美国要进一步利用联合国来为美国侵越战争服务的阴谋。他说，美国现在仍然希望联合国派“观察员”去“观察”由美国导演的南越傀儡集团将在九月举行的“选举”。据报道，联合国安全理事会主席、新西兰代表科纳十日说，他已经同安全理事会理事举行磋商，研究美国早些时候提出的关于联合国派“观察员”到南越去的建议。科纳说美国还建议，如果安全理事会不同意派“观察员”，美国主张由联合国的“人权委员会”派“观察员”到南越去。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡六日说，美国也主张“由国际监督委员会委员或日内瓦会议两主席……充当联合国观察员。”
