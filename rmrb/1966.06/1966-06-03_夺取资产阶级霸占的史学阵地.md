    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is violently impacting the reactionary fortresses in various fields of ideology, and also violently impacting the reactionary fortresses in the historical field.
    Bourgeois representatives regard history as an important front for their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. They distort history, use the past to satirize the present, deceive the masses, and prepare public opinion for capitalist restoration. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are using historical materialism, a fighting weapon, to reveal the true face of history, dissect the class trends of reality, and wage fierce struggles against reactionary historical views in order to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and defend socialism.
    Revolutionary historical materialism, namely historical materialism, and reactionary idealism, namely historical idealism, are fundamentally opposed. Historical materialism believes that the history of mankind is the history of the working people. Historical idealism believes that the history of mankind is the history of emperors, kings, generals and ministers. Historical materialism believes that revolution can change everything. Historical idealism believes that the grace of emperors, kings, generals and ministers determines everything. These two fundamentally opposed views of history cannot coexist peacefully.
    Proletarian revolutionary fighters use historical materialism to arm their minds and use historical materialism to observe and transform the world. All reactionaries are historical idealists, and they always violate the laws of historical development, attempting to pull the wheels of history backward. With the deepening of the socialist revolution, those who stubbornly cling to historical idealism will inevitably degenerate into anti-Party and anti-socialist elements batch by batch. This is an objective law that does not depend on human will.
    The bourgeois "authorities" occupying some historical positions and the bourgeois representatives supporting these "authorities" are placing themselves in a position hostile to the people. Some of these "authorities" have become anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and some have degenerated to the edge of anti-Party and anti-socialist.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history."
    Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "In Chinese feudal society, it was only this peasant class struggle, peasant uprisings and peasant wars that were the real motive force for historical development."
    Comrade Mao Zedong also made the following generalization: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years. To interpret history from this viewpoint is called historical materialism; standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism."
    The bourgeois "authorities" in the historical field are precisely opposed to these scientific conclusions of Comrade Mao Zedong. They stubbornly deny that thousands of years of civilized history is the history of class struggle. They use so-called "historicism," namely idealist historical view, to oppose and tamper with the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle. They stubbornly deny that the masses of the people are the motive force in creating world history, and they wantonly slander the working people and peasant wars. They clamor that the so-called "concession policies" of the reactionary ruling class are the motive force of historical development, and completely obliterate the great role of the working people and peasant wars. What they praise are only those emperors, kings, generals and ministers who ride on the heads of the people. They are the "royalist party" in the field of history.
    These "royalists" in the historical field do not make revolution themselves, nor do they allow others to make revolution. Revolutionary historians must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to rewrite all of history. This great historical revolution has aroused the unparalleled hatred of the "royalist party" in the historical field, making them feel that their doomsday is coming. They are doing their utmost to resist and undermine this revolution.
    The bourgeois "authorities" in the historical field are engaged in various activities against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to meet the needs of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class in resisting socialism. These "royalists" are protecting the old system, protecting the conservatives, protecting the old ideas, and also protecting the ideological front for preparing for capitalist restoration. A group of people even used the corpses of history to directly and viciously attack the great proletarian party and the socialist system.
    The battle between the two armies in the historical field is determined by the laws of class struggle in socialist society.
    In this new era of great change, Comrade Mao Zedong has made the latest and highest development of the Marxist materialist view of history. He systematically and comprehensively put forward the theory of contradictions, classes and class struggle in socialist society, and profoundly elucidated the motive force for the development of socialist society. He pointed out that the forward development of socialist society must take the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as the key link, and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism as the key link.
    This is the case in all aspects of our party and national life, and of course it is also the case in the field of history. Countless facts have proved that the field of history is full of fierce class struggle. If the proletariat relaxes its grip on the historical front, it will be occupied by the bourgeoisie. Here, either historical materialism is used to interpret history to serve proletarian politics and socialist revolution, or historical idealism is used to interpret history to serve bourgeois politics and capitalist restoration. In history, as in other sciences, historical materialism and historical idealism, proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, cannot coexist peacefully. This can only be a struggle of who defeats whom, a life-and-death struggle.
    The bourgeois "authorities" in the historical field deny class struggle in words, but in fact their series of reactionary fallacies and activities are blatant class struggles against the proletariat.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again… till their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people’s cause, and they will never go against this logic. This is a Marxist law." This law is fully applicable to domestic class enemies. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will never go against this logic. The "Three-Family Village" gang will never go against this logic. Anti-communist intellectuals in the historical field will also never go against this logic.
    History is an important front of ideology. Here, a fierce class struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie is underway. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must seize one by one the positions occupied by the bourgeois "authorities."
    The bourgeois "authorities" occupying some historical positions have implemented a dictatorship over the proletariat in certain departments. They used their power to release poisonous weeds and suppress the counterattack of the proletarian left. They adopted various despicable means to attack revolutionary historians. They monopolized materials like profiteers, and even after Wu Han, the vanguard of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party group, was exposed, they still concealed historical materials about Wu Han and shielded this old anti-communist. They are simply "Eastern Tyrants" and "Western Tyrants" in the historical field.
    These "authorities" regard the historical field as their exclusive territory. When others publish articles criticizing them, they openly clamor that this is "invading history." We tell this group of masters that we are going to occupy your anti-Party and anti-socialist historical front. What you call "invasion" is what we call "seizing power." We will retake the proletarian leadership that you have usurped and re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat in the territory where you have implemented the bourgeois dictatorship.
    In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly destroy the bourgeois reactionary historical front, and we must thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary idealist historical system that serves capitalist restoration. With the contemporary latest and highest fighting historical materialism developed by Comrade Mao Zedong in their hands, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian cultural revolutionary fighters will surely achieve great new victories and firmly plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the historical front.

    夺取资产阶级霸占的史学阵地
    无产阶级文化大革命，猛烈地冲击着意识形态各个领域里的反动堡垒，也猛烈地冲击着史学界的反动堡垒。
    资产阶级代表人物，把史学当作他们反党反社会主义的一个重要阵地。他们歪曲历史，借古讽今，欺骗群众，为资本主义复辟进行舆论准备。广大的工农兵群众、革命干部和革命的知识分子，正在运用唯物史观这个战斗的武器，揭露历史的本来面目，解剖现实的阶级动向，为保卫无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义，同反动的史学观点进行着激烈的斗争。
    革命的唯物史观，即历史唯物主义，和反动的唯心史观，即历史唯心主义，是根本敌对的。历史唯物主义认为，人类的历史是劳动人民的历史。历史唯心主义认为，人类的历史是帝王将相的历史。历史唯物主义认为，革命能改变一切。历史唯心主义认为，帝王将相的恩赐决定一切。这两个根本敌对的历史观，是绝对不能和平共处的。
    无产阶级革命的战士，用历史唯物主义来武装自己的头脑，用历史唯物主义来观察世界、改造世界。一切反动派，都是历史唯心主义者，他们总是违背历史发展规律，妄图把历史车轮拉向倒转。随着社会主义革命的深入，死抱着历史唯心主义不放的人，不可避免地会一批一批地堕落成反党反社会主义的分子。这是不依人的意志为转移的客观规律。
    盘踞一些史学阵地的资产阶级“权威”和支持这些“权威”的资产阶级代表人物，就是这样地把自己摆在同人民敌对的地位。这些“权威”，有的成了反党反社会主义分子，有的堕落到了反党反社会主义的边缘。
    毛泽东同志说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    毛泽东同志又说：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”
    毛泽东同志还作了这样的概括：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”
    史学界的资产阶级“权威”，正是反对毛泽东同志的这些科学论断的。他们顽固地否认几千年的文明史是阶级斗争的历史。他们用所谓“历史主义”即唯心史观，来反对和篡改马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争学说。他们顽固地否认人民群众是创造世界历史的动力，尽情污蔑劳动人民和农民战争。他们叫嚷反动统治阶级的所谓“让步政策”是历史发展的动力，把劳动人民和农民战争的伟大作用一笔抹煞。他们歌颂的，只是那些骑在人民头上的帝王将相。他们是史学界里的“保皇党”。
    这些史学界的“保皇党”，自己不革命，也不准别人革命。革命的史学工作者，要以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南，重新改写全部历史。这一场伟大的史学革命，引起了史学界“保皇党”的无比仇恨，使他们感到自己的末日来临。他们竭力抗拒和破坏这个革命。
    史学界里的资产阶级“权威”，进行种种反对马克思列宁主义、反对毛泽东思想的活动，是适应资产阶级和地主阶级反抗社会主义的需要的。这些“保皇党”，就是保护旧制度，保护守旧派，保护旧思想，也就是保护为资本主义复辟作准备的思想阵地。有一批人，还借历史上的僵尸，直接地恶毒攻击伟大的无产阶级政党和社会主义制度。
    史学界里的两军对战，是由社会主义社会的阶级斗争规律决定的。
    在我们这个伟大变革的新时代，毛泽东同志对马克思主义的唯物史观，作了最新最高的发展。他系统地全面地提出了社会主义社会矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，深刻地阐明了社会主义社会发展的动力。他指出社会主义社会向前发展，必须以无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争为纲，以社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争为纲。
    在我们党和国家生活的各个方面都是这样，在史学领域里当然也是这样。无数的事实证明，在史学领域里是充满着激烈的阶级斗争的。史学这个阵地，无产阶级一放松，就被资产阶级占领。在这里，不是用唯物史观解释历史，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义革命服务，就是用唯心史观解释历史，为资产阶级政治服务，为资本主义复辟服务。在史学中，和在其他科学中一样，唯物史观和唯心史观，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想，是绝对不能和平共处的。这只能是谁战胜谁的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。
    史学界里的资产阶级“权威”们，口口声声否认阶级斗争，其实他们一系列的反动谬论和活动，就是明目张胆地向无产阶级进行阶级斗争。
    毛泽东同志说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”这条定律，对于国内的阶级敌人，是完全适用的。地、富、反、坏、右，决不会违背这个逻辑。“三家村”之流的黑帮，决不会违背这个逻辑。史学界里的反共知识分子，也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    史学是意识形态的一个重要阵地。在这里，一场兴无灭资的激烈的阶级斗争，正在进行。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们必须把被资产阶级“权威”霸占的阵地，一个一个地夺取过来。
    霸占一些史学阵地的资产阶级“权威”，在某些部门里实行了对无产阶级专政。他们利用职权，大放毒草，压制无产阶级左派的反击。他们对革命的史学工作者，采取各种卑鄙的手段，加以打击。他们象奸商一样垄断资料，甚至在“三家村”反党集团的急先锋吴晗已经被揭穿之后，还隐瞒关于吴晗的史料，包庇这个反共老手。他们简直是史学界里的“东霸天”、“西霸天”。
    这些“权威”们，把史学领域当作他们独霸的地盘。别人发表文章批评他们，他们竟然公开叫嚷，这是“侵略历史”。我们告诉这班老爷们，对于你们的反党反社会主义的史学阵地，我们就是要去占领。在你们看来叫“侵略”，在我们看来叫“夺权”。我们就是要把被你们篡夺了的无产阶级领导权重新夺回来，在你们实行资产阶级专政的地盘上，重新建立起无产阶级专政。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，一定要把资产阶级的反动的史学阵地，彻底摧毁，一定要把为资本主义复辟服务的、反革命的唯心主义史学体系，彻底打垮。广大的工农兵群众和无产阶级的文化革命战士，手里有了为毛泽东同志发展了的当代最新最高的、战斗的历史唯物主义，一定能取得伟大的新胜利，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗牢牢地插在史学阵地上。
