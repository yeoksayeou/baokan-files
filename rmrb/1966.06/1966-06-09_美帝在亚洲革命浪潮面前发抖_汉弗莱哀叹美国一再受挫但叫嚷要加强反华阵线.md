    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th dispatch: U.S. Vice President Humphrey delivered a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, on the 8th, advocating that the U.S. intensify its use of counter-revolutionary dual tactics to deal with the surging revolutionary movement of the Asian people. But he admitted that American imperialism, surrounded by the people of the world, like elsewhere, "will repeatedly encounter disappointment, disillusionment... and setbacks in Asia."
    Humphrey expressed anxiety and unease about the "tide of nationalism and anti-colonialism" in Asia. He called Asia "a most important part" of a "complex and ever-changing world." He said worriedly, "In modern times—the past hundred years or so—Asia has meant revolution. And nearly fifty years ago, a new concrete danger was first added to this (revolutionary) process: the doctrines of Marx and Lenin were put forward as an interpretation of Asia's past, as a plan of action for Asia's present, and as a blueprint for Asia's future." Humphrey particularly regarded the Chinese people, who hold high the banner of anti-American revolution, as a thorn in his side and viciously attacked China. Speaking of the Vietnam problem, he said, "Of course, it is now the focus of war and revolution in Asia, and we are being tested there as never before."
    Driven to a dead end by the revolutionary movement of the Asian people, Humphrey could only once again beg for help from counter-revolutionary dual tactics to deal with "national liberation wars." He said that the United States must use force, "There is no substitute for force in the face of a resolute enemy." He particularly advocated strengthening the "arc" of aggression in Asia directly aimed at China and the revolutionary people of other Asian countries. He said, "At one end of the arc in Asia" is Japan, "at the other end on the South Asian subcontinent" is India, "and completing the triangle in the Southwest Pacific are our friends in Australia and New Zealand." In other places, there are the South Korean puppet government, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Indonesian government and other U.S. lackeys.
    While strengthening the military, Humphrey emphasized the need to use political and economic means. He said, "Military power alone is not enough. Military power will be ineffective if it is not accompanied by political efforts and…(economic) promises."
    Humphrey made it clear that American imperialism, like all reactionaries, is determined to follow the law of "make trouble, fail; make trouble again, fail again" to the grave of destruction. He said, "The problems of Asia are particularly complex and difficult. We will be dealing with these problems for a long time," "I am sure that in Asia, as elsewhere, we (the United States) will repeatedly encounter disappointment, disillusionment... and setbacks." "However, we will never stop."

    美帝在亚洲革命浪潮面前发抖
    汉弗莱哀叹美国一再受挫但叫嚷要加强反华阵线
    新华社八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国副总统汉弗莱八日在纽约州西点美国军事学院发表演说，鼓吹美国加紧使用反革命的两手策略来对付亚洲人民汹涌澎湃的革命运动。但是他承认，处在全世界人民包围中的美帝国主义象在别的地方一样，“在亚洲将一再遭到失望、幻想的破灭……和挫折”。
    汉弗莱对亚洲的“民族主义和反殖民主义的潮流”，表示惶恐不安。他把亚洲称为“复杂而不断变化的世界”的“一个最重要的部分”。他忧心忡忡地说，“在现代——过去一百年左右——亚洲意味着革命。而将近五十年前，在这个（革命）过程中第一次增加了一个新的具体危险：马克思和列宁的学说被提出来作为对亚洲的过去的解释，作为亚洲现在的行动计划，作为亚洲未来的蓝图。”汉弗莱对于高举反美革命大旗的中国人民特别视作眼中钉，对中国进行恶毒的攻击。他在谈到越南问题时说，“当然，现在那里是亚洲战争和革命的焦点，我们在那里受到了前所未有的考验”。
    被亚洲人民的革命运动逼得走投无路的汉弗莱只能再次乞灵于反革命两手策略来对付“民族解放战争”。他说，美国必须使用武力，在“坚决的敌人面前，是没有什么可以代替武力的。”他特别鼓吹加强美国在亚洲的矛头直接针对中国和亚洲其他国家的革命人民的“弧形”侵略阵线。他说，“在亚洲的弧线的一端”是日本，“在另一端在南亚次大陆上”是印度，“而在西南太平洋使这个三角形得以完成的是我们在澳大利亚和新西兰的朋友”。在其他地方则有南朝鲜傀儡政府、台湾蒋介石匪帮、菲律宾、泰国、“马来西亚”和印度尼西亚政府等美国仆从。
    在加强军事这一手的同时，汉弗莱强调还需要使用政治和经济的手段。他说，“光是军事力量是不够的。军事力量如果不伴之以政治努力和……（经济）诺言，就将毫无效果。”
    汉弗莱表明，美帝国主义和一切反动派一样，决心沿着“捣乱——失败，再捣乱，再失败”的规律走向灭亡的坟墓。他说，“亚洲问题特别复杂、特别难办。我们还将长期同这些问题打交道”，“我确信，在亚洲将象别的地方一样，我们（美国）将一再遭到失望、幻想的破灭……和挫折。”“然而我们决不罢手”。
