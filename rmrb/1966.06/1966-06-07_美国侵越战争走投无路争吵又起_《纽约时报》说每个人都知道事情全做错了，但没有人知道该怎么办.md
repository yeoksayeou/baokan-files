    According to Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch, a reporter from this agency reports: Within the American ruling clique, discussions and disputes continue to swirl around the issue of the war of aggression against Vietnam. Prominent figures in the American government and public, going beyond the norm and disregarding the notion of "washing dirty linen in private," are engaging in endless public disputes. This illustrates the severity of the failure of America's war of aggression against Vietnam and the consequent policy crisis.
    The chaotic situation in Saigon's political scene has caused great dissatisfaction among many members of the U.S. Congress with the government. Senate Democratic leader Mansfield said that the infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique "makes our (American) situation more difficult" and "will add an additional burden on American troops, which will be a burden detrimental to our country." Some members of Congress, such as House Republican leader Ford, have also continuously attacked the Johnson government for its "astonishingly mishandled" war of aggression against Vietnam. These criticisms have placed Johnson in a very embarrassing position. At a press conference in late April, he dejectedly admitted, "As we carry out this kind of activity so far from our homeland, difficulties will increase more and more. ... I don't want to hide it, we did make some mistakes, and we are sometimes criticized."
    The deepening quagmire of the American government in South Vietnam has made America's global strategic position passive and unable to focus on all aspects. This has caused unease among an increasing number of people in the American ruling clique. Fulbright is worried that the war of aggression against Vietnam will eventually drag down the entire United States. He said, "The United States is now showing that fatal recklessness, that excessive use of force and expansion of mission. That approach had caused the downfall of the ancient Athenians, Napoleon's France, and Nazi Germany."
    How to find a way out of the losing situation in Vietnam is the most headache-inducing problem for the American ruling clique. Some figures are vigorously advocating further expansion of the war, demanding further massive troop increases and more insane adventures to salvage the defeat. Another faction advocates expanding the bombing of North Vietnam to replace expanding the ground war. For example, Senator Stennis, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee and Democratic senator, said that the Joint Chiefs of Staff "have long recommended intensifying and strengthening the air strikes against North Vietnam." Stennis also clamored that taking this approach might lead to war with China, but "I think we must face and accept the risks involved."
    On the other hand, some people in the American ruling clique advocate playing more with the "peace" hand in the counter-revolutionary strategy of war and "peace," enticing the Vietnamese people to fall into America's trap, so as to obtain at the negotiating table what they cannot obtain on the battlefield. Fulbright said on May 17 that he advocated that the United States seek a "gradual reduction" in military affairs, "end" the bombing of North Vietnam as bait to conduct a "new Geneva Conference" to "seek a compromise solution to this war." But whether the leading figures in American political circles advocate more use of the war hand or more use of the "peace" hand, they have the same purpose, insist on the policy of aggression against Vietnam unchanged, and therefore they cannot find a way out of the predicament. The New York Times wrote: As in the past, this debate is characterized by: "Everyone knows that everything was done wrong, but no one knows very clearly what should be done."
    The isolated Johnson, in some recent speeches, has repeatedly called on the American ruling clique to "unite," and attacked those who criticize the government as "some nervous people and some disheartened and troubled people who defect from the ranks and oppose their leaders in times of tension."
    The New York Times said, "With more and more domestic and foreign problems, Johnson seems to have reached or approached the lowest point of his career in the White House so far."

### 美国侵越战争走投无路争吵又起  《纽约时报》说每个人都知道事情全做错了，但没有人知道该怎么办

    美国侵越战争走投无路争吵又起
    《纽约时报》说每个人都知道事情全做错了，但没有人知道该怎么办
    据新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：美国统治集团内部正在围绕侵越战争问题继续议论纷纭，争吵不休。美国朝野的头面人物越出常轨，顾不得什么“家丑不可外扬”，当众无休无止地进行争吵，这说明了美国侵越战争的失败以及随之而来的政策危机已经严重到了什么地步。
    西贡政局一团糟，使许多美国国会议员对政府大为不满。参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德说，南越傀儡集团的内讧“使我们（美国）的处境更加困难”，而且“会给美国军队增加额外的负担，这将是一种对我们国家不利的负担。”一些国会议员，例如众议院共和党领袖福特，还不断攻击约翰逊政府对侵越战争“令人吃惊地处置失当”。这些批评使约翰逊处境十分难堪。他在四月底的一次记者招待会上沮丧地承认，“我们在离本土这样远的地方进行这种活动时，困难是会越来越多的。……我不想掩饰，我们的确犯了些错误，我们有时的确受到批评。”
    美国政府在南越的泥潭中越陷越深使美国的全球战略地位，顾此失彼、十分被动，这一点也引起了美国统治集团中越来越多的人的不安。富布赖特则担心侵越战争终将把整个美国拖垮。他说，“美国现在正在表现出那种致命的冒失、那种过度使用力量和扩大使命的迹象。那种做法曾使古代的雅典人、拿破仑的法国和纳粹德国遭到覆灭。”
    怎样从侵越败局里找到一条出路，这是美国统治集团最伤脑筋的问题。有些人物正在大力鼓吹进一步扩大战争，要求进一步大举增兵、以更疯狂的冒险来挽回败局。还有一派主张扩大轰炸越南北方来代替扩大地面战争。例如，参议院军备小组委员会主席、民主党参议员斯坦尼斯说，参谋长联席会议“长期以来建议加紧和强化对北越的空袭。”斯坦尼斯还叫嚷，采取这种做法可能导致同中国作战，可是“我认为我们必须面对和接受这种牵涉到的风险”。
    另一方面，美国统治集团有些人则主张在战“和”两手反革命策略中更多地玩弄“和”的一手，诱骗越南人民上美国的圈套，以便在谈判桌上取得战场上得不到的东西。富布赖特五月十七日说，他主张美国谋求一种在军事方面“逐步降级的办法”，“结束”对越南北方的轰炸，以此作为钓饵来搞一次“新的日内瓦会议”来“寻求解决这场战争的一项折衷办法”。但是美国政界的头面人物不论鼓吹更多地使用战的一手还是更多地使用“和”的一手，他们都具有同一目的，都坚持侵略越南的政策不变，因而他们就不可能从困境中找到出路。《纽约时报》写道：和过去一样，这场辩论的特点是：“每一个人都知道事情全做错了，但是没有人很清楚知道应当怎样办”。
    处境孤立的约翰逊，在最近发表的一些讲话里一再呼吁美国统治集团“团结一致”，并且攻击那些批评政府的人是“一些神经质的人和一些灰心丧气和烦恼不安的人，这些人在紧张的情况下叛离队伍并反对自己的领袖”。
    《纽约时报》说，“由于国内国外问题越来越多，约翰逊似乎已达到了或者接近于他到目前为止在白宫的事业的最低潮。”
