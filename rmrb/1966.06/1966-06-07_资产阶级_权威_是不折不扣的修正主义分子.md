    Certain "authorities" have accused Comrades Zhuang Jiafu and Zhou Xinli of writing articles that are typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" in their study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This is a malicious slander. We, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this sharp weapon, and wage a resolute struggle against the bourgeois "authorities." Their frantic denunciation of our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is aimed at disarming us ideologically, so as to serve the bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They are thoroughgoing revisionists. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must resolutely overthrow these "authorities"!

    We Have No Common Language with Bourgeois "Authorities"
    The great Mao Zedong Thought is the compass for our actions, the red sun in our hearts. We cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought for a single moment in our revolution and construction. The Xixiaying Brigade rose by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. By listening to Chairman Mao, reading Chairman Mao's books, adhering to the Three Red Banners, and adhering to the principle of self-reliance and striving for progress, we have greatly changed the backward appearance of Xixiaying.
    Take grain production as an example. Before liberation, the average yield per mu in Xixiaying was less than one hundred jin. Although grain production had increased significantly by 1955, the state still supplied our brigade with 186,000 jin of grain. By 1958, our brigade not only did not need state grain, but also supported the state with 740,000 jin of grain. Since then, our team has shed the label of a grain-deficient team and become a surplus grain team. By 1964, the average yield per mu had reached 640 jin, more than six times higher than before liberation. Last year, during a severe drought of over 240 days with little snow or rain, after more than 80 days of carrying water to fight the drought, we still won a bumper grain harvest, with an average yield per mu reaching 670 jin, and supported the state with 2.6 million jin of grain. If we did not study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, could we have achieved such a great victory? Is this "vulgarization" or "pragmatism"? The facts show that the reason why certain "authorities" viciously attack us is that they hate the Party, hate socialism, hate Mao Zedong Thought, and dislike our great socialist achievements. They are looking at problems from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie, and they have no common language with us.

    We Have Infinite Love for Mao Zedong Thought
    Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us and vilifies us as being utterly worthless, that is even better, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy, but also that our work has been very successful." The more certain "authorities" oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Their opposition to Mao Zedong Thought is a vain attempt to promote the revisionist line, engage in counter-revolutionary restoration, and push us into the abyss, going backwards. This is absolutely impossible. We clearly remember that Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries created an inhumane "no-man's zone" in Xixiaying. They brutally murdered more than twenty of our class brothers, injured more than one hundred and thirty innocent villagers, burned down five hundred and twenty-seven houses in seven villages here, and cut down more than forty-two thousand trees on the mountains. They forced us to be separated from our wives and children, sleeping in the wild, eating chaff, and gnawing on tree bark. We also clearly remember: in the dark old society, two hundred and forty-six out of the two hundred and forty-seven poor and lower-middle peasant households in Xixiaying had worked as hired laborers, more than forty households lived by begging year-round, and thirty-one households sold their children. That tragic scene can never be forgotten. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who saved us from the abyss, and it was Mao Zedong Thought that guided us to achieve revolutionary victory. Whenever we think of these things, we have infinite love for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and we have boundless hatred for the class enemy. These bourgeois "authorities" who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are engaged in counter-revolutionary restoration; they are counter-revolutionaries. The bourgeois "authorities" oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought because they are afraid that the workers, peasants, and soldiers will make revolution against them. We must make revolution against them.

    Expose Fallacies and Overthrow Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Certain "authorities" are most opposed to and most afraid of our living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. We are determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and we are determined to put great effort into the word "application," studying and applying them every day, using them to guide us in doing a good job in the three great revolutionary movements. We must also use Mao Zedong Thought to recognize and severely strike at bourgeois "experts" and "authorities."
    Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, but applying is also learning, and it is the more important kind of learning. Learning warfare through warfare – this is our chief method." "Revolutionary war is the affair of the masses; it is often not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning; doing is itself learning." In the past, we fought on the battlefield against enemies with guns; we learned in war. Now, we fight against enemies without guns, and we must also learn in struggle. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow this gang of enemies without guns, and expose and discredit their conspiracies and fallacies one by one. The bourgeois "authorities" say that we are "pragmatists." Who is a "pragmatist"? They are the unadulterated "pragmatists." We have understood Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle. When we shine the "demon-revealing mirror" on them, we can see clearly what they are. They are out-and-out revisionists wielding the stick of "pragmatism." In order to win the complete victory of the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely smash the revisionist line, resolutely fight to the end, and resolutely overthrow the bourgeois "authorities."

    资产阶级“权威”是不折不扣的修正主义分子
    河北省遵化县西下营生产大队党总支书记  王佐民
    某些“权威”，指责庄家富和周信礼同志活学活用毛主席著作写的文章是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。这是恶毒的诬蔑。我们工农兵群众，要牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这一尖锐的武器，同资产阶级“权威”作坚决的斗争。他们疯狂地咒骂我们活学活用毛主席著作，目的是想解除我们的思想武装，为资产阶级、为地富反坏右效劳。他们是彻头彻尾的修正主义分子。我们工农兵要坚决打倒这些“权威”！
    我们和资产阶级“权威”没有共同语言
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是我们行动的指针，是我们心中的红太阳，我们搞革命，搞建设，一时一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。西下营大队就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗起家的。我们听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，坚持三面红旗，坚持自力更生、奋发图强的方针，才使西下营的落后面貌大为改观。
    拿粮食产量来说，解放前，西下营平均亩产不到一百斤，一九五五年虽然粮食产量有了显著增长，但是国家还供应我们大队粮食十八万六千斤。到了一九五八年，我们大队不仅没要国家粮食，而且还支援国家七十四万斤粮食。从此以后，我们队摘掉了缺粮队的帽子，变成余粮队。到了一九六四年，平均亩产就达到了六百四十斤，比解放前提高了六倍多。去年在二百四十天少雪无雨的大旱中，经过八十多天挑水抗旱，仍然夺取了粮食大丰收，平均亩产达到六百七十斤，支援国家二百六十万斤粮食。如果我们不活学活用毛主席著作，没有毛泽东思想的指导，能取得这样伟大的胜利吗？这是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”吗？事实说明，某些“权威”所以恶毒地攻击我们，是他们仇恨党，仇恨社会主义，仇恨毛泽东思想，不喜欢我们社会主义的伟大成就，是站在资产阶级立场上看问题，他们和我们没有共同语言。
    我们对毛泽东思想无限热爱
    毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”某些“权威”越是反对毛泽东思想，我们越是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。他们反对毛泽东思想，是妄想推销修正主义路线，搞反革命复辟，把我们推进火坑，走回头路，这是万万办不到的。我们清楚地记得，日本帝国主义、蒋介石反动派在西下营制造过惨无人道的“无人区”。刀砍活埋了我们二十几位阶级兄弟，打伤过一百三十多位无辜的乡亲，烧光了我们这里七个村的五百二十七座房屋，砍光了山上的四万二千多棵树木。逼得我们妻离子散，睡野地，吃谷糠，啃树皮。我们也清楚地记得：在黑暗的旧社会，西下营的二百四十七户贫雇农就有二百四十六人扛过活，四十多户常年以讨饭为生，三十一户卖儿卖女。那种悲惨情景，永远也忘记不了。是毛主席、共产党把我们从火坑里救了出来，是毛泽东思想指引着我们取得革命胜利。一想起这些，我们就对伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱，就对阶级敌人无比仇恨。这些反对毛泽东思想的资产阶级“权威”，是搞反革命复辟的，他们是反革命。资产阶级“权威”反对工农兵掌握毛泽东思想，是怕工农兵革他们的命。我们就是要革他们的命。
    揭穿谬论，打倒资产阶级“权威”
    某些“权威”最反对也最怕我们活学活用毛主席著作。我们学习毛主席著作，是学定了，用定了，我们坚决在“用”字上狠下功夫，天天学，天天用，用它来指导我们搞好三大革命。我们也要用毛泽东思想来认清和狠狠打击资产阶级“专家”、“权威”。
    毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”我们过去在战场上和拿枪的敌人作战，是在战争中学会的，现在和不拿枪的敌人作战，也要在斗争中学会。要用毛泽东思想打倒这伙不拿枪的敌人，把他们的阴谋、谬论一个个揭穿、批臭。资产阶级“权威”说我们是“实用主义”，谁是“实用主义”？他们才是不折不扣的“实用主义”。我们懂得了毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的理论，用“照妖镜”一照，就能看清他们是什么东西。他们是拿着“实用主义”棍子的地地道道的修正主义分子。为了赢得社会主义文化大革命的彻底胜利，我们要坚决粉碎修正主义路线，坚决战斗到底，坚决打倒资产阶级“权威”。
