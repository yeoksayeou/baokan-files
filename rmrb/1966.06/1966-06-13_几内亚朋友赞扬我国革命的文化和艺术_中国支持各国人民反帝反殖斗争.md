    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, June 10th. Abdoulaye Bangoura, Secretary-General of the Workers' Union of the Boffa Region of Guinea and member of the Guinean trade union delegation that recently visited China, published an article in the Guinean newspaper "Liberté" on the 10th, praising China's support for the struggle of people of all countries against imperialism and colonialism, as well as China's great achievements in socialist revolution and construction.
    He said: "In China, internationalism is not an empty phrase. For the Chinese people, the revolution will not end until the people of all countries still under various forms of political, economic, and cultural enslavement by imperialism and colonialism have completely shaken off all oppression."
    He said that the spirit of friendship and solidarity consistently expressed and concretely embodied by the Chinese people impresses, moves, and endears those who have visited and understood China.
    He expressed extreme praise for China's revolutionary culture and art, especially for the fact that the screen and stage no longer feature emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, but workers, peasants, laborers, and revolutionary intellectuals.
    Abdoulaye Bangoura visited China for nearly a month, touring several major cities. He highly praised the political education conducted by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government among the people throughout the country to serve the socialist revolution, as well as the achievements made in industry and in improving the people's livelihood.
    He said that in more than ten years, the Chinese people have made astonishing achievements in industry, clearing away the long-standing poison left over by feudalism and imperialism. China's heavy industry has developed greatly, and light industry has been established in all important regions. He also praised the abundance and sufficient supply of various products on the markets in Chinese cities.

    几内亚朋友赞扬我国革命的文化和艺术
    中国支持各国人民反帝反殖斗争
    新华社科纳克里十日电　不久前访问中国的几内亚工会代表团成员、几内亚博法地区工人联合会总书记阿卜杜拉耶·邦古拉十日在几内亚《自由报》发表文章，赞扬中国支持各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争以及中国在社会主义革命和建设方面的巨大成就。
    他说：“在中国，国际主义不是一句空话。在仍然处于帝国主义和殖民主义的政治、经济和文化方面各种形式的奴役之下的各国人民还没有彻底摆脱一切压迫以前，对中国人民来说，革命就不会终止。”
    他说，中国人民一贯表示和具体体现的友好和团结的精神，使访问过中国和了解中国的人感到钦佩、同情和怀着深情厚谊。
    他对中国的革命的文化和艺术表示极为赞扬，特别是对银幕上和舞台上不再是帝王将相或者才子佳人，而是工农劳动者和革命知识分子，表示极为赞赏。
    阿卜杜拉耶·邦古拉在中国访问近一个月，参观访问了一些大城市。他高度评价中国共产党和中国政府在全国人民中进行的为社会主义革命服务的政治教育，以及在工业方面和在改善人民生活方面所取得的成就。
    他说，在十多年的时间内，中国人民在工业方面取得了惊人的成就，清除了封建主义和帝国主义长期遗留下来的毒害。中国的重工业有了巨大的发展，并且在所有重要的地区都建立了轻工业。他还赞扬中国各城市市场上各种产品的丰富和充足的供应。
