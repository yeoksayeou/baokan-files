    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 16th. Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau, issued a statement in Colombo on the 15th, condemning the Soviet revisionist clique for plotting to hold split meetings, undermining the upcoming emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers in Beijing, and undermining Afro-Asian solidarity. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    In view of recent developments affecting the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement, the Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau deems it necessary to issue a statement.
    In early March 1966, writers from Ceylon, Indonesia, China, and other Afro-Asian countries suggested holding an emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The Secretary-General agreed to this suggestion and, based on it, contacted all members of the Standing Bureau on March 19, 1966, to seek their endorsement. The Secretary-General also informed the members of the Standing Bureau that the Chinese Writers' Association was willing to host the meeting. As the Vietnam issue was an urgent matter, the Secretary-General requested a response by April 10, 1966.
    As of April 10, 1966, the vast majority of the Standing Bureau members replied, expressing their approval for holding the meeting in Beijing.
    The Soviet Writers' Association, seemingly to obstruct the implementation of this suggestion, questioned the necessity of holding an emergency meeting in its reply. They said, "In a few months, a meeting of world figures from science and culture will be held in Hanoi," and they claimed that they had been invited to participate in this meeting. Furthermore, they requested time to study our suggestion and suggested holding a Standing Bureau meeting in Colombo.
    In its reply, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic initially welcomed holding an emergency meeting or a Standing Bureau meeting, or both, in Cairo.
    We telegraphed a reply to the Soviet and UAR writers on April 11, 1966, informing them that the vast majority of the Standing Bureau members had agreed to hold an emergency meeting in Beijing and that arrangements were being made accordingly, including the establishment of a preparatory secretariat in Beijing on April 20, 1966, to implement this decision of the Standing Bureau.
    On April 16, 1966, the Standing Bureau issued a public statement, formally announcing the arrangements that had been made for this meeting.
    However, disregarding the decision of the vast majority of the Standing Bureau members, and disregarding the arrangements made to implement this majority decision, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic telegraphed us on April 14, suggesting that the Standing Bureau's decision to hold an emergency meeting was illegal.
    The Indian writers, in a delayed reply issued on April 28, 1966, suggested holding this writers' meeting in Cairo.
    At the same time, the preparatory secretariat, in accordance with the majority decision, fulfilled its duties and sent invitations at the end of April 1966 to writers from fifty-one Afro-Asian countries, attaching a draft agenda for the meeting scheduled to begin on June 27, 1966. Simultaneously, the Standing Bureau meeting was scheduled to be held in Beijing from June 23 to 24, 1966.
    After this, we were surprised to receive a letter from the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic on May 23, 1966, stating that the decision to hold the emergency writers' meeting in Beijing was illegal and that they were inviting members of the Standing Bureau to go to Cairo on June 10, 1966, to hold a meeting.
    In response, we wrote back to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic on June 6, 1966, pointing out that all their arguments were based on errors and inaccurate information, and the erroneous inferences derived therefrom. We also expressed the hope that, after learning about the various facts confirming the legitimacy of the Standing Bureau's decision (as we reaffirmed in our reply), they would turn around and give clear support to the heroic Vietnamese people.
    In our reply, we also pointed out that their invitation to convene a Standing Bureau meeting in Cairo on June 10, 1966, was arbitrary and illegal, and the Secretary-General had not authorized the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic to convene such a meeting.
    Meanwhile, under the instructions of the Secretary-General, the preparatory secretariat convened a Standing Bureau meeting in Beijing on June 9, 1966. Representatives from Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, and Sudan attended the meeting. The meeting discussed and unanimously approved the preparations made for the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers scheduled to open in Beijing on June 27, 1966, and announced that writers from more than forty countries had accepted the invitation to attend the emergency meeting. The Soviet Union, the UAR, and India, which had requested that a Standing Bureau meeting be held first to discuss the emergency meeting, did not attend the meeting for reasons best known to themselves. This meeting "unanimously and severely condemned this activity of undermining the revolutionary interests of Afro-Asian writers and peoples, and fully endorsed the correct steps taken by the Secretary-General to deal with such sabotage and divisive activities."
    We are surprised that the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic, disregarding and failing to implement the legitimate decisions of the Standing Bureau, and violating the fervent desire of Afro-Asian revolutionary writers to unanimously support the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, has, under the pretext of consultation, sent invitations to certain individuals to conduct separate discussions in Cairo on June 19, 1966.
    Apparently, the initiators of the illegal June 10th Cairo meeting changed their minds and abandoned the suggestion. The Soviet splitters, in their initial response to us, questioned whether it was necessary to convene a writers' meeting to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, and said that they needed time to study the suggestion. It seems that they conducted behind-the-scenes activities to instigate the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of the United Arab Republic to convene this "consultation" meeting; we reiterate that this meeting is equally illegal.
    We know that it is not the first time that Soviet revisionist splitters have engaged in trickery in revolutionary international organizations, serving the reactionaries and imperialists.
    Our experience proves that those who are unwilling to struggle against imperialism, for reasons best known to themselves, often use fabricated technical, legal, and trivial issues to undermine the great struggles of freedom and peace fighters.
    The Vietnamese people are heroically waging a life-and-death struggle against the American aggressors. It is imperative that the freedom-loving and anti-imperialist peoples of the world provide them with fraternal support.
    We believe that the revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa will see through the open or covert conspiracies of the splitters and schemers. These people are acting as accomplices of imperialism, attempting to undermine every action taken by the oppressed people to win the victory of the liberation struggle.
    Let future historians not record: while Vietnam was burning in the flames of war, several members of the Standing Bureau were fiddling!
    Let not future generations curse the Afro-Asian writers for intentionally or unintentionally sowing the seeds of division in yet another great and united movement using their pens to create a world without aggression, oppression, and exploitation!

    亚非作家常设局秘书长发表声明号召支援越南人民反美斗争
    谴责苏联修正主义者策划召开分裂会议破坏亚非团结
    重申阿联亚非人民团结委员会在开罗召开“协商”会议是非法的
    新华社科伦坡十六日电  亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克十五日在科伦坡发表声明，谴责苏联修正主义集团策划召开分裂会议，破坏即将在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，破坏亚非团结，声明全文如下：
    鉴于最近某些发展情况影响到亚非作家运动，亚非作家常设局秘书长认为有必要发表声明。
    锡兰、印度尼西亚、中国和其他亚非作家，在一九六六年三月初建议召开亚非作家紧急会议，支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争。秘书长同意这一建议，根据这一建议，已于一九六六年三月十九日与常设局全体成员进行联系，争取他们的赞同。秘书长还通知常设局各成员，中国作家协会愿意做会议的东道主。由于越南问题是个紧迫的问题，秘书长要求于一九六六年四月十日前得到答复。
    截至一九六六年四月十日，常设局绝大多数成员答复表示赞同在北京召开会议。
    苏联作家协会，看来为了阻挠实现这个建议，在答复中就有无必要开紧急会议提出了疑问。他们说，“几个月后，将在河内举行世界科学和文化界人士的会议”，他们声称，他们已经被邀请参加这个会议。此外，他们要求给予时间研究我们的建议，并建议在科伦坡举行常设局会议。
    阿拉伯联合共和国亚非人民团结委员会在答复中，起先欢迎在开罗举行紧急会议或常设局会议，或两者都在开罗举行。
    我们于一九六六年四月十一日复电苏联和阿联作家，通知他们，常设局绝大多数成员已同意在北京举行紧急会议，并且正据此进行安排，包括于一九六六年四月二十日在北京成立筹备秘书处，来贯彻常设局的这项决定。
    一九六六年四月十六日，常设局发表公报，正式宣布为这次会议业已作出的安排。
    但是，阿联亚非人民团结委员会无视常设局绝大多数成员的决定，不顾为了贯彻这一多数决定而作出的安排，在一九六六年四月十四日打电报给我们，暗示常设局关于举行紧急会议的决定是非法的。
    印度作家迟迟在一九六六年四月二十八日发出的答复中，建议在开罗举行这次作家会议。
    与此同时，筹备秘书处根据多数决定，履行它的职责，在一九六六年四月底向五十一个亚非国家的作家发出了邀请，并附去预定在一九六六年六月二十七日开始的会议议程草案。同时，常设局会议预定于一九六六年六月二十三日到二十四日在北京举行。
    在此以后，我们惊奇地收到了阿联亚非人民团结委员会一九六六年五月二十三日的来信，信中说在北京举行作家紧急会议的决定是非法的，并说他们正在邀请常设局的成员于一九六六年六月十日去开罗举行会议。
    对此，我们在一九六六年六月六日复信阿联亚非人民团结委员会，指出他们所有的论点都是根据错误和不确切的情况，以及由此而得出的错误推断。我们还表示希望，在了解到确定常设局决定的合法性的各种事实（如我们在答复中所重申的）之后，他们会回过头来给予英雄的越南人民以明确的支持。
    我们在答复中还指出，他们发出邀请于一九六六年六月十日在开罗召集常设局会议是专断的和非法的，秘书长并没有授权阿联亚非人民团结委员会召开这样的会议。
    与此同时，筹备秘书处在秘书长的指示下，于一九六六年六月九日在北京召开了常设局会议。参加这次会议的有喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、加纳、印度尼西亚、日本和苏丹。会议讨论了并一致赞成为定于一九六六年六月二十七日在北京开幕的亚非作家紧急会议所作的筹备工作，并宣布迄今已有四十多个国家的作家接受了出席紧急会议的邀请。曾经要求先开常设局会议来讨论紧急会议问题的苏联、阿联和印度等三国，由于他们自己知道得最清楚的原因，没有出席会议。这次会议“一致严厉谴责这种破坏亚非作家和人民革命利益的活动，并完全赞同秘书长为了对付这种破坏和分裂活动而采取的正确步骤。”
    我们奇怪的是，阿联亚非人民团结委员会无视和不执行常设局的合法决定，并且违反亚非革命作家一致支持英雄的越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争的热烈愿望，竟以进行协商为名，向某些人发出邀请，于一九六六年六月十九日到开罗去另外进行讨论。
    显然，非法的六月十日开罗会议的发起人改变了主意，放弃了这项建议。苏联分裂主义者在最初给我们的答复中，对是否必须召开作家会议来支持越南人民反对美国侵略的斗争提出了疑问，并且说，他们需要时间来研究这个建议。看来，他们进行了幕后活动来怂恿阿联亚非人民团结委员会召开这个“协商”会议；我们重申，这个会议同样是非法的。
    我们知道，苏联修正主义分裂者在革命的国际组织中玩弄手段，为反动派和帝国主义者效劳，这已经不是第一次了。
    我们的经验证明，那些不愿意同帝国主义斗争的人，为了他们自己知道得最清楚的理由，常常利用捏造出来的技术、法律和琐碎的问题来破坏自由和和平战士们的伟大斗争。
    越南人民正在英勇地进行着一场反对美国侵略者的你死我活的斗争。世界上热爱自由、反对帝国主义的各国人民向他们提供兄弟般的支援，这是迫切的需要。
    我们相信，亚非的革命作家会识破分裂主义者和阴谋家的公开或隐蔽的阴谋。这些人充当帝国主义的合谋者，企图破坏被压迫人民为争取解放斗争的胜利所采取的每一个行动。
    不要让未来的历史学家这样记载下来：正当越南在战火中燃烧的时候，常设局的几个成员在拉琴！
    不要让后代诅咒亚非作家在又一个伟大的团结一致的、用他们的笔杆来创造没有侵略、压迫及剥削的世界的运动中，有意或无意地散布了分裂的种子吧！
