    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Drawing a clear line between reactionaries and revolutionaries, exposing the conspiracies and tricks of the reactionaries, arousing vigilance and attention within the revolutionary ranks, boosting our own morale, and deflating the enemy's arrogance are all necessary to isolate the reactionaries, defeat them, or replace them.

    毛主席语录
    划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之。
