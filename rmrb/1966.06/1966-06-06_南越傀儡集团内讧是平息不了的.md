    The recent infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique has escalated to the point of mutual armed conflict. The mass struggle against the U.S.-puppet regime has also swept through major cities in the enemy-occupied areas. The South Vietnamese puppet regime is becoming increasingly shaky, and the U.S. position in South Vietnam is becoming more precarious. Although, under U.S. pressure, the two major puppet groups in South Vietnam have reached a "reconciliation," this is only temporary. The contradictions between them cannot be resolved, and the struggle of South Vietnamese Buddhists and the masses against the U.S.-puppet regime cannot be stopped.
    The recent firefight within the South Vietnamese puppet clique began with a surprise attack by the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group on the Nguyễn Chánh Thi group, instigated by the United States. From May 15th to 22nd, the two sides engaged in a fierce battle in Da Nang, a major U.S. base. After eight days of fighting, with hundreds of casualties on both sides, the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group gained control of Da Nang. The contradiction between the South Vietnamese puppet groups has escalated to the point of real fighting, which is unprecedented.
    This unprecedentedly fierce infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique was prompted by the U.S. policy of further supporting Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and tightening control over the South Vietnamese political situation after the Honolulu Conference. Of course, the more important reason is that the victorious development of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has fundamentally shaken the U.S. colonial rule in South Vietnam, thereby exacerbating the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and between one group of running dogs and another.
    At the Honolulu Conference held in February this year, Johnson desperately inflated Nguyễn Cao Kỳ's value, dressing him up as the representative of a "legitimate government" seemingly supported by the South Vietnamese people. The purpose was to try to "stabilize" the rule of this puppet regime, so that the United States could freely carry out and expand its war of aggression. After the Honolulu Conference, the United States instructed Nguyễn Cao Kỳ to eliminate dissidents and squeeze out the former commander of the puppet First Army Corps, Nguyễn Chánh Thi, which was a step by U.S. imperialism to further control the South Vietnamese puppet regime.
    However, contrary to its wishes, the United States instructed Nguyễn Cao Kỳ to kick Nguyễn Chánh Thi aside, which not only did not "stabilize" the rule of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, but also promoted the fierce development of internal contradictions within the puppet group, creating greater chaos in the South Vietnamese situation. Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Cao Kỳ have long had contradictions in their struggle for power and profit. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ is the leader of the "young guards" of the puppet army and has strength. However, Nguyễn Chánh Thi once gained some political capital in launching the coup against Ngô Đình Diệm, and has always controlled the military and political power in the central region. It is obvious that Nguyễn Chánh Thi and his cronies were not willing to be excluded. Therefore, the infighting between the puppet groups changed from secret struggle to open struggle, and from open struggle to firefight, to the point of being out of control.
    In order to support the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group in eliminating dissidents and further controlling the South Vietnamese political situation, U.S. imperialism has always played the trick of both suppression and deception. In mid-April, when infighting broke out within the puppet group and the people of the cities in the enemy-occupied areas also launched a new upsurge in their struggle against the U.S.-Nguyễn group, Washington instructed the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group to stage the so-called "National Political Representative Conference" farce, attempting to use deceptive tricks such as "general election" to establish a "civilian government" to ease the people's resistance and quell the opposition's resistance to the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group. This move failed. In mid-May, the Johnson administration supported the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group in sending troops to Da Nang to openly carry out armed suppression against the opposition. Washington originally thought that in this way, the political situation in South Vietnam could be stabilized. However, the development of things went exactly against the subjective wishes of U.S. imperialism. The result of the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group's implementation of armed suppression was to ignite more intense anger against the U.S.-Nguyễn group in South Vietnam, and to put the political situation in South Vietnam into greater turmoil.
    Faced with this new development in the South Vietnamese situation, the Johnson administration was flustered and extremely uneasy. It was worried that Nguyễn Cao Kỳ would collapse under attacks from all sides, disrupting its entire step in the aggression against Vietnam and shaking its colonial rule in South Vietnam, and it did not dare to intervene too publicly, arousing greater dissatisfaction and resistance. In the words of the U.S. press, "the chaos among Washington policymakers is only comparable to the chaos in Saigon." Recently, the United States has been trying to bring together the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ group and the Nguyễn Chánh Thi group to hold meetings, promote their "reconciliation" and "compromise," and at the same time step up the disintegration and disintegration of the forces supporting Nguyễn Chánh Thi. However, the facts show that no matter what methods U.S. imperialism takes, whether it is suppression or deception, whether it is a hard hand or a soft hand, the contradictions between the South Vietnamese puppet groups are irreconcilable. Even the *New York Times* believes that the current infighting in the South Vietnamese puppet group is just "the beginning of a long period of political turmoil." The United States' attempt to establish a stable "government" in South Vietnam is like building a solid house on the beach, just a wishful fantasy.
    "When it rains, it pours; when a boat is broken, it encounters headwinds." In South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has already suffered repeated military defeats, and now it is encountering an increasingly serious crisis of rule in the political arena. These two aspects are closely related and mutually influential. The more U.S. imperialism loses militarily, the more turbulent the political situation in South Vietnam will be. And the more unstable the South Vietnamese puppet regime is, the more the U.S. aggressors will suffer military setbacks. Military defeats have deepened the political crisis, and conversely, the political crisis has aggravated the military defeat. The Johnson administration is in such a vicious circle that it cannot extricate itself. U.S. imperialism cannot escape the fate of complete military failure and complete political bankruptcy in South Vietnam.

### 南越傀儡集团内讧是平息不了的

    南越傀儡集团内讧是平息不了的
    最近以来，南越傀儡集团的内讧，发展到了相互火并的程度。群众性的反美伪集团的斗争风暴，也席卷敌占区各大城市。南越傀儡政权更加摇摇欲坠，美国在南越的处境更加狼狈。虽然，在美国压力下，南越两大傀儡集团间又已取得“和解”，但这只是暂时的，它们之间的矛盾是解决不了的，南越佛教徒和群众的反美伪斗争更是阻挡不了的。
    南越傀儡集团最近的火并，是以阮高其集团在美国指使下，向阮正诗集团发动突然袭击而开始的。从五月十五日到二十二日，在美军的重要基地岘港，火并双方展开了一场激烈的交锋。经过八天的混战，双方死伤数百名，阮高其集团才控制了岘港。南越傀儡集团之间的矛盾，发展到真刀真枪，大打出手，这是前所未有的。
    南越傀儡集团之间这一场空前激烈的内讧，是美国在檀香山会议以后，进一步支持阮高其、加紧控制南越政局的政策所促成的。当然，更重要的原因，是南越人民抗美救国斗争的胜利发展，使美国在南越的殖民统治发生了根本动摇，从而加剧了美帝国主义和它的走狗之间、这群走狗和那群走狗之间的矛盾。
    今年二月召开的檀香山会议上，约翰逊拼命抬高阮高其的身价，把他打扮成似乎是得到南越人民支持的
  “合法政府”的代表。其目的就是企图“稳定”这个傀儡政权的统治，以便于美国放手地进行和扩大侵略战争。檀香山会议之后，美国指使阮高其排除异己，挤掉了原伪第一军军长阮正诗，这正是美帝国主义进一步控制南越傀儡政权的一个步骤。
    但是，事与愿违，美国指使阮高其一脚踢开阮正诗，不但没有“稳定”南越傀儡政权的统治，反而促使傀儡集团内部矛盾激烈发展，造成了南越局势更大的混乱。阮正诗和阮高其长期以来就存在着争权夺利的矛盾。阮高其是伪军的“少壮派”头子，拥有实力。但阮正诗曾经在发动反对吴庭艳的政变中，捞到了一些政治资本，而且一直把持中部地区的军政大权。阮正诗及其党羽决不甘心自己被排斥，这是显而易见的。因此，傀儡集团之间就由暗斗变成了明争，又由明争发展到火并，以至达到不可收拾的地步。
    美帝国主义为了支持阮高其集团排除异己，进一步控制南越政局，一贯玩弄压和骗的两手。四月中旬，当傀儡集团发生内讧，敌占区城市人民也掀起反对美阮集团斗争的新高潮时，华盛顿就指使阮高其集团演出所谓“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧，企图用“大选”成立“文官政府”等骗人的把戏来缓和人民的反抗和平息反对派对阮高其集团的反抗。这一着没有得逞。五月中，约翰逊政府又支持阮高其集团出兵岘港，对反对派公然实行武装镇压。华盛顿本来以为这样一来，南越的政治局势就可以稳定下来。但是，事情的发展正好走到了美帝国主义主观愿望的反面。阮高其集团实行武力镇压的结果，是在南越点燃起更炽烈的反对美阮集团的怒火，是使南越的政治局势陷于更大的动乱。
    面对着南越局势这种新的发展，约翰逊政府手忙脚乱，极度不安。它既担心阮高其在各方面的攻击下垮台，打乱了它的整个侵略越南的步骤，动摇它在南越的殖民统治地位，又不敢过于公开插手，激起更大的不满和反抗。用美国报刊的话说，“只有华盛顿决策者中间的混乱才堪与西贡的混乱相媲美”。最近以来，美国一直在撮合阮高其集团和阮正诗集团举行会议，促进他们“和解”、“妥协”，同时对支持阮正诗的力量加紧进行分化、瓦解。但是，事实表明，不管美帝国主义采取什么手法，压也好，骗也好，硬的一手也好，软的一手也好，南越傀儡集团之间的矛盾是不可调和的。就连《纽约时报》也认为，南越傀儡集团目前的内讧只是“一个长时期的政治动乱的开端”。美国要想在南越建立一个稳定的“政府”，就象要在沙滩上建立一座坚固的房子一样，不过是一种一厢情愿的幻想。
    “屋漏又逢连夜雨，船破更遇顶头风”。在南越，美帝国主义已经在军事上连遭失败，现在它又在政治上遇到了日益严重的统治危机。这两方面是密切关联，相互影响的。美帝国主义越是在军事上失利，南越的政局就越是动乱。而南越傀儡政权越是不稳，美国侵略者在军事上就越要受挫。军事失利加深了政治危机，反过来，政治危机又加重了军事失败。约翰逊政府正是处在这样一种恶性循环之中而不能自拔。美帝国主义在南越是逃脱不了军事上彻底失败和政治上彻底破产的命运的。
