    After the Socialist Cultural Revolution movement was launched vigorously, all monsters and demons were in a panic, trying every means to maintain their strength and wait for an opportunity. The "Three-Family Village" branch of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun, exposed by Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others of Peking University with their big-character poster, is a vivid example. This gang of black bandits vainly attempted to divert the attention of the revolutionary masses and lead this great political struggle into the trap of "academic debate." This big-character poster exposed this big conspiracy. This big-character poster was powerful and well-written! We must learn from the dauntless fighting spirit of Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others who dare to open fire on all bourgeois "authorities" and sweep away all reactionaries. There are still such monsters and demons all over the country, and we must be vigilant, sharpen our eyes, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to drag them out one by one!
    What is infuriating is that the black gangs of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and others, in the nationwide surging tide of denouncing Deng Tuo, still regarded themselves as leaders and "authorities," clamoring that "there is an urgent need for leadership now to guide the movement to develop in the correct direction." Their attempt was to drag this vigorous revolutionary movement into a dead end. If we were to listen to their "leadership," there would be no Cultural Revolution, but only the restoration of capitalism! We must resolutely follow the direction pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carry out the Socialist Cultural Revolution to the end, and never stop until complete victory.
    Congratulations on the birth of the big-character poster by Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others! We believe that the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University, with their revolutionary traditions, will hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and overthrow all bourgeois "authorities" and all monsters and demons. A thriving, truly socialist new Peking University will soon emerge.

    学习你们大无畏的战斗精神
    海军某部　刘德明　沈明江
    社会主义文化大革命运动轰轰烈烈开展起来以后，一切牛鬼蛇神惊惶万状，想尽各种办法，企图保持实力，待机而动。北京大学聂元梓等同志贴大字报揭露的宋硕、陆平、彭珮云的“三家村”分店，就是生动的一个事例。这伙黑帮妄想转移革命群众的视线，把这场伟大的政治斗争引导到“学术争论”的圈套里去。这张大字报，揭穿了这个大阴谋。这张大字报，贴得有力，贴得好！我们要学习聂元梓等同志这种敢于向一切资产阶级“权威”开火的大无畏战斗精神，横扫一切反动分子。全国各地象这样的牛鬼蛇神还有，我们要提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，以毛泽东思想为武器，把它们一个个都揪出来！
    令人气愤的是，宋硕、陆平等黑帮，在全国汹涌澎湃声讨邓拓的浪潮中，还以领导“权威”自居，叫嚣什么“现在急切需要领导，引导运动向正确的方向发展”，他们的企图是要想把这场轰轰烈烈的革命运动，拉到死胡同里去。如果听任他们的“领导”，那就不会有文化大革命，而只会有资本主义的复辟！我们必须坚决遵循党中央和毛主席指引的方向，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    祝贺聂元梓等同志大字报的诞生！我们相信有着革命传统的北京大学的无产阶级革命派，一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把一切资产阶级的“权威”和一切牛鬼蛇神统统打倒。一个欣欣向荣的真正社会主义的新北大很快就会出现。
