    Long Live Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Creative Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works
    Feng Fusheng, Political Instructor of a certain Air Force Unit on the Fujian Front

    The bourgeois "authorities" viciously cursed the good articles on the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works written by Comrades Zhuang Jiafu and Zhou Xinli as typical examples of "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism." This is a malicious attack on us workers, peasants, and soldiers for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, opposing us treating Chairman Mao's books as the supreme directives for all work, and opposing us using the great Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, command everything, promote everything, create everything, transform everything, and conquer everything. This is openly counter-revolutionary language, and it is completely hostile to us workers, peasants, and soldiers. With the great enemy before us, we must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly overthrow them.

    Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Creative Study and Application of Chairman Mao's Works is an Epoch-Making Event

    Mao Zedong Thought is the forever-shining red sun in our hearts. In the old society, we workers, peasants, and soldiers suffered the cruel oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists, and our hard work year after year could not even keep us fed and clothed. We struggled on the brink of death year after year. The landlord and capitalist's hired writers, the so-called "authorities," "scholars," "experts," and "professors," monopolized all the positions of science and culture. Schools were not open to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and newspapers and magazines were the mouthpiece of the landlords and capitalists. We workers, peasants, and soldiers were deprived of the right to read and study. At that time, the landlords in the countryside cursed us as "poor ghosts," "dirty things," and "born slaves." The capitalists in the city slandered us as "country bumpkins," "idiots," and "good-for-nothings." Those "authorities" then wrote books and established theories to fool us, telling us to believe in horoscopes and feng shui, burn incense and chant Buddhist scriptures, and believe in so-called "upright officials." In a word, they wanted us, the proletariat and working people, to obediently work to the bone for the landlords and capitalists, making them "blessed by heaven." These bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" were the landlords and capitalists' loyal running dogs. They wore the same pants as the landlords and capitalists, riding roughshod over the people and becoming enemies of the working people. Bourgeois "authorities," you have harmed us enough in the old society. Those days of suffering are now gone forever. Under the guidance of the great, wise, and correct Mao Zedong Thought, the land of China has been liberated, and we workers, peasants, and soldiers have become masters of the country and our own destiny. The era when we workers, peasants, and soldiers were politically and economically oppressed and exploited, and culturally and theoretically fooled and enslaved, is over. The Party and Chairman Mao have created good conditions for us to study. Under the shining light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the era when we workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp theory has begun. This is an epoch-making event. This shows that we workers, peasants, and soldiers have not only politically and economically, but also culturally and spiritually, turned over and truly stood up. Take myself as an example. Through the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, I understood why the old society was bad and so dark; I understood why the new society is so good and so sweet; I understood the fundamental path for China's proletariat and working people to defeat powerful enemies and escape suffering. The more I learn, the more I don't forget the past bitterness, and I know that today's happiness did not come easily; the more I learn, the more I don't forget today's sweetness, and I don't forget tomorrow's communist ideals. I want to make up my mind, not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and fight to the end for the victory of communism in all of China and the world. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood classes and class struggle, understood the dictatorship of the proletariat, understood the nature of imperialism and reactionaries in all countries, understood the harm of modern revisionism to the international communist movement, and understood that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. To defend the motherland, build the motherland, and support world revolution, we must forever hold the gun tightly.

    I have been studying Chairman Mao's works for fifteen years. The more I learn, the more firm my position becomes, the brighter my eyes become, and the more vigorous my revolutionary will becomes. The more I study Chairman Mao's works, the more I love to study them, and the more I love the great Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Chairman Mao's works has turned me from an oppressed and exploited "cowherd" and "waiter" into a glorious fighter striving for the great and magnificent cause of communism. Is this "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism"?

    Our People's Liberation Army enthusiastically responded to the call of the Military Commission and Vice-Chairman Lin Biao to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and there emerged the great communist fighters Lei Feng and Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, and other heroes, as well as a large number of four-good companies and heroic units. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, our army is striding forward on the road of revolutionization and combat readiness.

    Take my own ordinary unit as an example. All of our comrades creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and their class consciousness has greatly improved. Good deeds are constantly emerging. Under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people completely and thoroughly, dedicating ourselves to the revolution and everything for the revolution, not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or death, living for the people, dying for the people, being in the company but having the motherland in mind, looking out on the world, being selfless and solely benefiting others, being extremely responsible for work, being extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people, etc., have become the criteria for our revolutionary fighters' thoughts and actions. As a result, in 1965, the percentage of five-good fighters and five-good staff in our section reached 63%, and we were rated as a four-good section. From January to April of this year, all the comrades in our section continued to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, implementing the five principles of giving prominence to politics proposed by Vice-Chairman Lin Biao, and the revolutionary spirit of cadres, soldiers, and staff has been further developed. We use Mao Zedong Thought to guide cooking, saving 46% of coal for cooking according to standards. Our workers, peasants, and soldiers act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, consciously contributing their wisdom and strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, winning glory for the Party and the people, and winning glory for the proletariat. Is this "vulgarization," and "pragmatism"?

    The people of the whole country creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and it works wherever it is used. The people of Daqing creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and built the world's first-class oil field at a speed that capitalism and modern revisionism dare not imagine, making China self-sufficient in oil and creating a miracle that had never existed in history. The people of Dazhai creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, despise difficulties strategically, pay attention to difficulties tactically, and fight heaven, earth, and class enemies, creating heroic achievements. Our table tennis team creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, dared to fight, dared to win, and defeated strong opponents in the 28th World Table Tennis Championships, winning five championships and four runners-up. Our scientific and technical personnel, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and the masses of workers creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, working hard and fighting day and night, and successfully carried out three nuclear explosions. The broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals in our country creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and went to the mountains and the countryside, factories and companies, combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and taking the road of intellectual laborization and revolutionization. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, all fronts, all industries, and all regions in our country have shown an unprecedented vibrant and prosperous scene. Is this "vulgarization," and "pragmatism"?

    Bourgeois "authorities," open your eyes and look at these iron-clad living facts! This is our most resounding answer to you.

    Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Can Best Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought

    The great Mao Zedong Thought is the highest summary of contemporary human wisdom. It highly summarizes the experience of our Party, our army, and our people in decades of revolutionary struggle and construction, and summarizes the positive and negative experiences of the international communist movement. We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the creators of history and the main force of revolutionary struggle and construction. We are engaged in the struggle to transform the world and create a new historical era for mankind under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is connected to us by flesh and blood. We have the most right and are most able to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well. We have the deepest proletarian feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. This feeling is specifically manifested in our unwavering belief in Mao Zedong Thought. This belief is to firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, the powerful weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism, the guiding principle for the Chinese revolution and construction, and the lighthouse for world revolution. The fate of our proletariat and working people is closely linked with the great Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly believe that Chairman Mao's works contain millions of soldiers and are an inexhaustible treasure trove for us for generations to come. We firmly believe that once we workers, peasants, and soldiers grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we will have endless wisdom and strength. We firmly believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, there is no problem that cannot be solved, no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and no enemy that cannot be defeated. This feeling is completely consistent with loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, loving socialism, being loyal to the motherland, being loyal to the people, being loyal to the world revolution, and opposing exploitation and oppression. Therefore, we infinitely love, infinitely admire, and infinitely believe in Mao Zedong Thought, and we can find answers and obtain the most satisfactory solutions to any problem in Chairman Mao's works. With this profound class feeling of infinite love, infinite belief, and infinite admiration, we resolutely support and resolutely implement everything that Chairman Mao advocates; we resolutely oppose and resolutely struggle against everything that Chairman Mao criticizes.

    Our workers, peasants, and soldiers have the clearest purpose in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, that is, to study to transform our thinking, to study to do our work well, to study to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, and to study for the sake of socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the realization of communist ideals. When we creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and achieve success, we can never forget the cultivation of the Party and the help of our comrades, and prevent and overcome any pride that may arise. When we encounter difficulties in our studies, we think of Chairman Mao's teaching: when we see achievements and light in times of difficulty, we have the courage to fight against the difficulties on the road ahead and constantly push our studies forward.

    We workers, peasants, and soldiers have the highest degree of revolutionary consciousness in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This consciousness is to regard the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works as our highest class responsibility and lifelong political task, consciously treat Chairman Mao's books as the supreme directive for all our work, and consciously launch a struggle to promote proletarian ideas and eliminate bourgeois ideas. This is because we suffered the most in the old society, we love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and we regard the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the first need in our lives, as important as breathing, eating, and drinking water. When we workers, peasants, and soldiers get up every morning, the first thing we think of is how to work according to Mao Zedong Thought today, and to fight and study together with our comrades; before going to bed at night, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to check our words and deeds and work of the day, otherwise we cannot sleep well. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have the most tenacious study perseverance in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We workers, peasants, and soldiers shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the motherland, building the motherland, and supporting the world revolution. We study Chairman Mao's works without the good study conditions of the bourgeois "authorities." We have heavy tasks, little time, low education, and busy work. But when we think of the past bitterness, today's sweetness, and tomorrow's communist ideals, as well as the heavy responsibility of revolutionary successors, we generate unparalleled strong study perseverance. When time is short, we make use of every available moment; when education is low, we "hold a dictionary in one hand and a selected works of Mao in the other." We learn and look up words at the same time, truly achieving that we will not be crushed by tight schedules, we will not be defeated by low education, and we will not be overwhelmed by heavy tasks. We workers, peasants, and soldiers study Chairman Mao's works and master Mao Zedong Thought, and we become the bravest, smartest, most powerful, and most knowledgeable people. We can control the objective laws of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiments, and we can change the world and create miracles. We can defeat any enemy and overcome any difficulty. Bourgeois "authorities," you curse us for "vulgarization" and "pragmatism," and put on an "authoritative" face, as if you have some great knowledge. May I ask what knowledge you have? Your minds are full of thoughts of becoming officials and masters, riding roughshod over the people, and you are constantly thinking of engaging in conspiracies and tricks, and opposing the Party and socialism. You are well-fed, do not participate in labor, do not go deep into the masses, and do not go deep into reality. What real knowledge do you have? In front of the workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, your knowledge, you "authorities," is simply worthless!

    Thoroughly Overthrow the Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Resolutely Defend the Great Mao Zedong Thought

    Why do these so-called "authorities" of the bourgeoisie completely negate the great spiritual and material achievements made by the mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and completely negate the great significance of this mass movement? Why is their position so different from ours? Chairman Mao's works gave us the best answer. Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary; whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Chairman Mao's works are a "demon-revealing mirror." Once you shine it, it becomes clear that they are a group of counter-revolutionaries standing on the side of the overthrown class enemies. We workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and master Mao Zedong Thought, which means mastering the powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all the bourgeoisie, which means that our great motherland will advance along the socialist and communist road indicated by Chairman Mao, which means that the Chinese revolution and the world revolution will achieve complete victory under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, which also means the complete collapse of the bourgeois "authorities'" dreams of promoting revisionism and restoring capitalism in China. They were afraid, they trembled, and like a cornered beast, they fought desperately. So they picked up sticks like "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" and hit us with them. A handful of tiny mantises raised their arms in front of the rumble of the historical chariot. How could they stop the progress of history? Bourgeois "authorities," we want to warn you that your attempts to oppose our workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought are futile and a pipe dream. We have the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the support of Chairman Mao, and all your conspiracies and tricks will not succeed. On the contrary, it can only expose your counter-revolutionary ugly face of being enemies with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be frightened or suppressed. We dare to fight the enemy with guns face to face, and we dare to fight you enemies without guns even more. The more you suppress us, beat us with sticks, and put labels on us, the more it proves that we study Chairman Mao's works well and use them well; the more it proves that our workers, peasants, and soldiers can truly master Mao Zedong Thought! Let all bourgeois "authorities" tremble in the face of the great movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works! Long live the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works by workers, peasants, and soldiers! The great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the earth and will completely wash away the anti-Party and anti-socialist dirty words spewed out by all bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars." A brand-new era in which workers, peasants, and soldiers are masters in culture and theory will appear before us. Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    工农兵活学活用毛主席著作万岁
    福建前线空军某部政治指导员　丰福生
    资产阶级“权威”把庄家富同志和周信礼同志所写的两篇活学活用毛主席著作的好文章，咒骂为“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。这是恶毒地攻击我们工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作，反对我们把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，反对我们用伟大的毛泽东思想武装头脑，统帅一切，推动一切，创造一切，改造一切，战胜一切。这是公开的反革命语言，是彻底地与我们工农兵为敌。大敌当前，必须坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把他们打倒。
    工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是一件划时代的大事
    毛泽东思想是我们心里永远不落的红太阳。在旧社会，我们工农兵受地主资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，终年辛勤劳动得不到温饱，年复一年地挣扎在死亡线上。地主资本家的御用文人，所谓“权威”、“学者”、“专家”、“教授”们垄断着一切科学文化阵地，学校不向工农兵开门，报纸杂志是地主资本家的喉舌。我们工农兵被剥夺了读书学习的权利。那时农村的地主骂我们是“穷鬼”、“脏东西”、“天生的奴才”。城里的资本家诬蔑我们是“土包子”、“笨蛋”、“没出息的东西”。那些“权威”就著书立说，愚弄我们，要我们信八字、风水，烧香念佛，信奉什么“清官”，一句话，要我们无产阶级和劳动人民服服贴贴地为地主资本家卖命，做牛做马，使地主资本家“洪福齐天”。这些资产阶级的“权威”、“学者”，是地主资本家的忠实走狗，他们和地主资本家合穿一条裤子，与地主资本家一样骑在人民头上作威作福，与工农劳动人民为敌。资产阶级的“权威”老爷们！我们在旧社会被你们害得够苦了。这种苦难的日子现在已经一去不复返了。在伟大英明和正确的毛泽东思想指引下，中国的大地已经解放了，我们工农兵已经成了国家和自己命运的主人。我们工农兵在政治上、经济上受压迫、受剥削的时代，在文化上、理论上受愚弄、受奴役的时代过去了。党和毛主席给我们创造了良好的学习条件。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们工农兵直接掌握理论的时代开始了，这是一件划时代的大事。这说明我们工农兵不仅在政治上、经济上，而且在文化上、在精神上都翻身了，真正站起来了。拿我自己来说，我通过活学活用毛主席著作，懂得了旧社会为什么不好，为什么那样黑暗；懂得了新社会为什么这样好，这样甜；懂得了我国无产阶级和劳动人民战胜强大的敌人，摆脱苦难的根本道路。我越学越不忘记过去的苦，知道今天的幸福来之不易；越学越不忘今日的甜，越不忘明天的共产主义理想。我要下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，为共产主义在全中国和全世界的胜利奋斗到底。我通过学习毛主席著作，懂得了阶级和阶级斗争，懂得了无产阶级专政，懂得了帝国主义和各国反动派的本性，懂得了现代修正主义对国际共产主义运动的危害性，懂得了枪杆子里面出政权。要保卫祖国，建设祖国，支援世界革命，就要永远握紧枪杆子。
    我学习毛主席著作，已有十五个年头，我越学立场越坚定，眼睛越明亮，革命意志越旺盛。我对毛主席著作越学越爱学，越学越热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。学习毛主席著作使我从一个受压迫受剥削的“放牛娃”、“堂倌”，成为一个为伟大壮丽的共产主义事业奋斗的光荣战士，这难道是“庸俗化”、“简单化”和“实用主义”吗？
    我们人民解放军热烈响应军委和林彪副主席的号召，活学活用毛主席著作，出现了伟大的共产主义战士雷锋和王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得等大批英雄人物，出现了大批四好连队和英雄单位。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我军正在革命化、战斗化的大道上阔步前进。
    拿我自己所在的这个普普通通的单位来说。我们全体同志活学活用毛主席著作，阶级觉悟大大提高，好人好事不断出现。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，完全彻底为人民服务，一心为革命、一切为革命，一不为名、二不为利，一不怕苦、二不怕死，生为人民生、死为人民死，身居连队、心怀祖国、放眼世界，毫不利己专门利人，对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱等，已成为我们革命战士思想和行动的准则。因而我们科里五好战士和五好职工，在一九六五年达到百分之六十三，评上了四好科。今年一至四月份，我们全科同志，继续活学活用毛主席著作，落实林彪副主席提出的突出政治的五项原则，干部、战士、职工的革命精神进一步发扬。我们用毛泽东思想指导烧火，按标准节约了炊事用煤百分之四十六。我们工农兵按毛主席的指示办事，为中国革命和世界革命自觉地贡献自己的智慧和力量，为党为人民争光，为无产阶级争光，这难道是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”吗？
    全国人民活学活用毛主席著作，用到那里那里灵。大庆人活学活用毛主席著作，用资本主义和现代修正主义不敢想的速度建成了世界上第一流的大油田，使我国石油自给，创造了历史上没有过的奇迹。大寨人活学活用毛主席著作，战略上藐视困难，战术上重视困难，斗天、斗地、斗阶级敌人，创造了英雄的业绩。我国乒乓球队活学活用毛主席著作，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，在第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，打败强手，取得了五项冠军、四项亚军的辉煌胜利。我国的科学技术人员，人民解放军指战员和工人群众，活学活用毛主席著作，辛勤劳动，日夜奋战，胜利地进行了三次核爆炸。我国广大的革命知识分子，活学活用毛主席著作，纷纷上山下乡，下厂下连，与工农兵结合，走知识分子劳动化革命化的道路。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我国各条战线，各行各业，各个地区都出现了空前未有的朝气勃勃、欣欣向荣的景象。这些难道是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”吗？
    资产阶级的“权威”们，你们睁开眼睛看一看这些铁一般活生生的事实吧！这就是我们工农兵对你们最响亮的回答。
    工农兵最能学好用好毛泽东思想
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是当代人类智慧最高的总结，高度概括了我党我军我国人民几十年革命斗争和建设的经验，总结了国际共产主义运动正反两面的经验。我们工农兵是历史的创造者，是革命斗争和建设的主力军。我们就是在毛泽东思想指导下进行着改造世界、创造人类新的历史时代的斗争的。毛泽东思想和我们血肉相连，我们最有权利，也最能够学好用好毛泽东思想。我们对毛泽东思想有最深厚的无产阶级感情，这种感情具体表现在我们对毛泽东思想无比坚定的信念，这个信念就是坚信毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大武器，是中国革命和建设的指针，世界革命的灯塔。我们无产阶级和劳动人民的命运与伟大的毛泽东思想紧密地联系在一起。我们坚信毛主席著作内自有雄兵百万，是我们世世代代取之不尽用之不竭的宝库。我们坚信我们工农兵群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就有无穷无尽的智慧和力量。我们坚信在毛泽东思想的指引下，没有解决不了的问题，没有克服不了的困难，没有战胜不了的敌人。这种感情是与热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义，忠于祖国、忠于人民、忠于世界革命、反对剥削压迫完全一致的。所以我们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限崇拜，无限信仰，遇到任何问题都能在毛主席著作中找到答案，获得最满意的解决。有了这个无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的深厚的阶级感情，凡是毛主席提倡的我们就坚决拥护，坚决执行；凡是毛主席批评的，我们就坚决反对，坚决斗争。
    我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作有最明确的目的，即为改造思想而学，为做好工作而学，为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义而学，为了社会主义革命、社会主义建设和实现共产主义理想而学。当我们活学活用毛主席著作有成绩的时候，能够念念不忘党的培养和同志们的帮助，防止和克服可能产生的骄傲情绪。当我们学习遇到困难的时候，就想到毛主席的教导：在困难的时候看到成绩，看到光明，就有勇气同前进道路上的困难作斗争，把学习不断地向前推进。
    我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，有最高度的革命自觉。这种自觉就是把活学活用毛主席著作当作自己最高的阶级责任，终身的政治任务，自觉地把毛主席的书当作我们各项工作的最高指示，自觉地在思想上展开兴无灭资的斗争。这是因为我们在旧社会受苦最深，我们对毛主席的书最爱读，把活学活用毛主席著作当作自己生活的第一个需要，如同呼吸、吃饭、喝水一样重要。我们每天早晨起床的时候，首先想到的是今天怎样按毛泽东思想来进行工作，和同志们一起战斗学习；晚上睡觉以前，要用毛泽东思想来检查自己一天的言行、工作，否则就睡不好觉。我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，有最顽强的学习毅力。我们工农兵担负着保卫祖国、建设祖国、支援世界革命的重任。我们学习毛主席著作，没有资产阶级“权威”们那样好的学习条件。我们任务重，时间少，文化低，工作忙。但是我们想起过去的苦，今日的甜，和明天的共产主义理想，以及革命接班人的重任，就产生了无比坚强的学习毅力。时间少，我们就见缝插针；文化低，我们就“一手拿字典，一手拿毛选”。边学，边查，真正做到时间紧挤不倒，文化低难不倒，任务重压不倒。我们工农兵学习毛主席著作，掌握了毛泽东思想，就成了最勇敢、最聪明、最有力量、最有知识的人，我们就可以驾驭阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的客观规律，就可以改天换地，创造奇迹，能够打败任何敌人，能够克服任何困难。资产阶级“权威”们，你们咒骂我们“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，摆出一副“权威”面孔，好象你们有什么了不起的知识。请问你们有什么知识呢？你们满脑子想的是做官当老爷，骑在人民头上作威作福，天天想的是搞阴谋诡计，反党反社会主义。你们吃饱了饭，不参加劳动，不深入群众，不深入实际，你们有什么真正的知识呢？在掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵面前，你们的知识，你们这些“权威”，简直一钱不值！
    彻底打倒资产阶级“权威”
    坚决捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想
    这些资产阶级的所谓“权威”，为什么全盘否定工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动所取得的伟大的精神成果和物质成果，全盘否定这个群众运动的伟大意义呢？为什么他们的立场和我们是如此的不同呢？毛主席著作给了我们最好的回答。毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”毛主席著作是“照妖镜”，一照就清楚了，原来他们是一帮站在被推翻的阶级敌人一边的反革命派。我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，就是掌握战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切资产阶级的强大思想武器，就意味着我们伟大的祖国要沿着毛主席所指示的社会主义、共产主义的大道迈进，就意味着中国革命和世界革命将要在毛泽东思想指导下，取得彻底的胜利，也就是意味着这些资产阶级“权威”们在中国推行修正主义、复辟资本主义美梦的彻底破灭。他们害怕了，他们发抖了，狗急跳墙，困兽犹斗，于是他们拿起“庸俗化”、“实用主义”等棍子朝我们打下来了。一撮渺小的螳螂，在雷霆万钧的历史车轮面前举起了他们的手臂，他们怎么能阻挡住历史的前进呢？资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，我们要警告你们，你们想反对我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，这是枉费心机，白日做梦。我们有党中央领导，毛主席撑腰，你们的一切阴谋诡计都不能得逞。相反，只能暴露你们与工农兵为敌的反革命丑恶面目。毛泽东思想是我们工农兵的命根子，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵是吓不倒压不垮的。我们敢于同拿枪的敌人面对面斗，更敢于同你们这些不拿枪的敌人斗。你们越是压我们，打我们的棍子，扣我们的帽子，越证明我们学习毛主席著作，学得好，用得好；越证明我们工农兵能真正地把毛泽东思想学到手！让一切资产阶级“权威”在工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的伟大运动面前发抖吧！工农兵活学活用毛主席著作万岁！伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉普照大地，必将彻底涤荡一切资产阶级“权威”“学者”喷吐出来的反党反社会主义的污言烂语。在我们面前将出现一个工农兵在文化上、理论上当家做主的崭新的时代。伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
