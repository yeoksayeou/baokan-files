Title: Exposing匡亚明's Reactionary Countenance
Author: Liu Changfu, Li Zhengzhong
Date: 1966-06-26
Edition: 4

    匡亚明, that wolf in sheep's clothing, usurped the position of First Secretary of the Party Committee and President of Nanjing University, spare no effort to praise bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities", clamoring to make them all "feel comfortable" and to give full "play" to their "role" of instilling capitalist ideas into young people. He also desperately opposed the Party's leadership over the school and the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals, attempting to turn Nanjing University into a bourgeois "free kingdom". He once said to a teacher in the Chinese Department: "What do you want to join the Party for? Joining the Party is a miserable life, and you will be criticized and have your salary deducted if you do something wrong. I have had my salary deducted four times... It is better to be outside the Party, so comfortable! So free!" Look! What a thoroughly reactionary countenance.
    匡亚明 truly deserves to be called the "intimate friend" of bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities". For a long time, he wore the cloak of an "old Party member" and "old revolutionary", harboring deep-seated hatred for the Party in his heart, stirring up trouble everywhere, encouraging those bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" to adhere to their reactionary positions, stubbornly resist ideological remolding, resist the leadership of the Party, and painstakingly create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, attempting to hand over the seal of the school to bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities". This is wishful thinking! We must resolutely fight to the end with you, this small handful of anti-Party, counter-revolutionary elements, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory!

    匡亚明的反动嘴脸
    匡亚明这只披着羊皮的恶狼，窃踞南京大学党委第一书记兼校长的职位，竭力吹捧资产阶级“学者”、“权威”，大嚷着要让他们都“心情舒畅”，很好地“发挥”向青年灌输资本主义思想的“作用”。他还拚命地反对党对学校的领导，反对党对知识分子的思想改造政策，妄图把南京大学变成资产阶级的“自由王国”。他曾对中文系某教师说：“你们要入党干什么？入党苦死了，做错了事还要挨批评，扣薪水。我就被扣了四次薪水……还是你们党外人士好，多么舒服！多么自由！”看！这是一副十足的反动的嘴脸。
    匡亚明真不愧为资产阶级“学者”、“权威”的“知心人”。他长期披着“老党员”、“老革命”的外衣，内心怀着对党的刻骨仇恨，到处煽风点火，鼓动那些资产阶级“学者”、“权威”坚持自己的反动立场，顽固地抗拒思想改造，抗拒党的领导，处心积虑地为资本主义复辟制造舆论准备，妄图把学校的印把子交给资产阶级的“学者”、“权威”。这是痴心妄想！我们要坚决同你们这一小撮反党、反革命分子斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
