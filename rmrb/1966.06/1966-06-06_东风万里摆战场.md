    The East Wind Sweeps the Battlefield for Ten Thousand Miles
    Jiangsu Yangzhou Pesticide Factory Worker Jin Li
    Socialism is just great, the anti-Party black gangs can't oppose it!
    The sky is full of bright sunshine, illuminating the demons and monsters, leaving them nowhere to escape!
    Gun against gun, knife against knife, class struggle is firmly remembered;
    If the enemy sticks out his head, we smash his brain, if the enemy reaches out his hand, we chop off his claws;
    Poisonous weeds, dig them out by the roots, evil winds, sweep them head-on;
    The revolutionary momentum cannot be stopped, all the demons and monsters will be defeated!
    The East wind sweeps the battlefield for ten thousand miles, the earth shakes, the sky quakes, mountains roar and the sea surges,
    The Great Cultural Revolution on the cultural front, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high!

    东风万里摆战场
    江苏扬州农药厂工人  金力社会主义就是好，反党黑帮反不了！满天阳光明亮亮，照得妖魔没处逃！枪对枪，刀对刀，阶级斗争记得牢；敌人伸头咱砸脑，敌人伸手咱斩爪；毒草，连根挖，妖风，兜头扫；革命气势不可挡，牛鬼蛇神全打倒！东风万里摆战场，地动天摇山海啸，文化战线大革命，毛泽东思想红旗举得高！
