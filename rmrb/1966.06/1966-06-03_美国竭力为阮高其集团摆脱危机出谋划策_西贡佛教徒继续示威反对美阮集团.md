    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, June 2nd - Saigon news: Saigon Buddhists continued to demonstrate against the US-puppet clique on the 1st. The United States continues to broker a quick "reconciliation" between the Nguyen Cao Ky group and its opposition, in an attempt to temporarily overcome the current political crisis.

    According to Western news agencies, after Thich Thien Minh, one of the leaders of the Saigon Buddhist groups, was stabbed and injured on the 1st, a group of Buddhist youths in Saigon held a demonstration against the US-puppet clique that afternoon, burning a US military jeep on a street near the Buddhist Hoa Dao Institute. That evening, thousands of Buddhist youths took to the streets to demonstrate and burned an effigy of US President Johnson.

    Western news agencies also reported that Washington was "visibly uneasy" about the incident in which youth and students in Hue burned the US "Consulate" on the 1st. On this day, one thousand Hue students burned down the US "Consulate" and the residences of its personnel, and tore up pictures of US President Johnson. The students' flags read "Down with US Colonialist Policies." A US State Department spokesman issued a statement on the matter on the 1st, again urging the Saigon puppet clique to "reach a reconciliation as soon as possible" to prevent the situation from continuing to develop in a direction unfavorable to US-puppet rule.

    According to reports, under the vigorous planning of the United States, Nguyen Cao Ky continued to hold bargaining negotiations with the leaders of various Buddhist factions on the 1st. Afterwards, Nguyen Cao Ky announced that the puppet "Military Committee" would soon be expanded to include ten additional civilian members, absorbing various religious denominations and political groups to appease his opposition. Representatives of the Buddhist Hoa Dao Institute stated that they were "prepared to accept" this "compromise solution," but demanded that the puppet "Head of State" Nguyen Van Thieu step down and a new election be held. Another leader of the Buddhist faction demanded that a "transitional government" be established to replace Nguyen Cao Ky's military government before holding a "general election."

    In Da Nang, Nguyen Cao Ky on the 1st dismissed Hoang Van Cao, the puppet commander of the First Military Region whom he had just appointed half a month earlier, making this the fourth puppet First Military Region commander Nguyen Cao Ky had replaced in less than three months.

    美国竭力为阮高其集团摆脱危机出谋划策
    西贡佛教徒继续示威反对美阮集团
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：西贡的佛教徒一日继续举行反对美伪集团的示威。美国继续撮合阮高其集团同它的反对派尽快“和解”，以求暂时度过目前的政治危机。
    据西方通讯社报道，西贡佛教团体的领导人之一释善明在一日被刺受伤后，西贡的一批佛教青年在当天下午举行了反对美伪集团的示威，他们在佛教化道院附近的街道上烧毁了一辆美军吉普车。当天晚上，又有成千的佛教青年上街示威，并且焚烧了一个模拟美国总统约翰逊的假人。
    西方通讯社还报道说，华盛顿当局对顺化青年学生一日烧毁美国“领事馆”的事件“明显地感到不安”。这一天，一千名顺化学生烧毁了美国“领事馆”及其人员的宿舍，撕毁了美国总统约翰逊的象片。学生们的旗子上写着“打倒美国殖民主义政策”。美国国务院发言人一日就这件事发表谈话，再次催促西贡傀儡集团“尽快达成一项和解办法”，以免局势继续向不利于美伪统治的方向发展。
    据报道，在美国竭力策划下，阮高其一日继续同佛教各派头目举行讨价还价的谈判。事后阮高其宣布，不久将扩大伪“军事委员会”，增加十名文职委员，吸收各教派和政治团体参加，以安抚他的反对派。佛教化道院的代表表示“准备接受”这个“折衷方案”，但是要求伪“国家元首”阮文绍下台，另行选举。佛教的另一派领导人则要求在举行“大选”前成立一个“过渡政府”来代替阮高其的军人政府。
    在岘港，阮高其在一日又把他半个月前刚任命的伪第一军区司令黄文高撤职，这是阮高其在不到三个月内撤换的第四个伪第一军区司令。
