    We Are Young Automobile Workers
    Worker of the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory Fang Dewen

    If we are coal, we must burn; if we are fire, we must shine. Only steel that can withstand the forging of fierce struggle is good steel! We young automobile workers have a heart as red and hot as a furnace. To give the motherland a pair of wings to fly, we fight in the ice and snow-stricken north. Although we come from all corners of the country, we all share a common revolutionary ideal. Though our songs are all in our hometown melodies, their rhythm carries the sounds of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, their keynote is the same -- we are marching on the socialist road. Our steps are firm, our eyes are bright, and we are charging forward along the road pointed out by the Party! Our drive is like the rapidly turning wheels always moving forward, our enthusiasm is as hot as an engine just ignited, undergoing trials in the revolutionary furnace, growing strong in the storms of class struggle. Though our factory buildings are only three *li* square, world events and the spirit of the times resonate here. Though our assembly line is only a hundred meters long, it is connected to Tiananmen Square, and the five continents and four oceans. Though our red hearts are only the size of a fist, they shine with the light of communism... In order to make the blast furnace glow red, in order to make the oil flow from the oil fields, in order to make the coal mines churn out black gold, in order to make the communes' granaries full of grain and cotton, our automobiles advance against wind and rain, and the control lever in our hands is always set to full throttle! How many difficulties are burned in the engine, how many billowing waves of smoke are discharged from the exhaust pipe, how many nights are lit by the headlights, the window is always transparent and bright, because our revolutionary zeal is burning in the cylinder, and the flame of our youth is shining in the headlights. Look, another Liberation brand automobile drives out of the factory, the road ahead is bright and glorious. Full speed ahead! The wheels of the times whir in the wind, that is us, the young automobile workers, spreading our wings and flying on the socialist road. (Attached photo)

    我们是年轻的汽车工人
    长春第一汽车公司工人　房德文是煤就要燃烧，是火就要闪光，经得起火热斗争的锻打才是好
  钢！我们年轻的汽车工人啊，有一个炉火般赤热的胸膛，为了给祖国插一双飞翔的翅
  膀，战斗在冰雪严寒袭击的北方。我们虽然来自五湖四海，但都怀着一个共同的革命理
  想。唱歌虽然都是家乡曲调，音韵里带着长江涛声黄河浪
  响，但是基调都是一个——我们走在社会主义大道上。我们脚步扎实，眼睛明亮，沿着党指引的大道向前闯！冲劲象疾转的车轮永远向前，热情象刚点火的发动机那么火
  旺，在革命的熔炉里经受考验，在阶级斗争的风暴里壮大成
  长。我们厂房虽然只有三里平方，但世界风云、时代精神却在这
  里震响。我们的装配线虽然只有百米
  长，它却连着天安门广场、五洲四
  洋，我们的红心虽然只有拳头大，但却闪耀着共产主义的光芒……为了让高炉炉火通红，为了让油田石油流淌，为了让煤海翻滚乌金，为了让公社粮棉装满谷仓，我们的汽车顶风披雨前进，手里的操纵杆总是挂上满挡！发动机里烧焦多少困难，排气筒排出股股烟浪，照明灯点亮了多少夜晚，车窗前永远是透明闪亮，因为汽缸里有我们革命热情在
  燃烧，车灯里是我们青春的火焰在闪
  光，看，又一台解放牌汽车开出厂
  房，眼前的道路灿烂辉煌。加足马力高速向前飞跑，时代的车轮掠着风响，那是我们年轻的汽车工人，在社会主义大道上展翅飞翔。（附图片）
