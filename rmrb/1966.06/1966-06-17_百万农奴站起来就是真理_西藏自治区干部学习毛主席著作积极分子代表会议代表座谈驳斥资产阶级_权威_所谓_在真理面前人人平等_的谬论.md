    Daoji Cairang (Head of Jiacha County, Shannan Prefecture): The bourgeois representatives who have sneaked into the Party repeatedly shout "Equality for all before truth," which is like a wolf serenading a mountain. They vainly attempt to use this bourgeois reactionary slogan to obliterate the core of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—the doctrine of class and class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a definite class position, and all kinds of ideas are invariably stamped with a class brand." Truth has a class nature. Historical facts and life experience show that there has never been truth that transcends class, and there has never been equality between two hostile classes. In the past, the three major feudal lords of Tibet treated serfs like cattle and horses, but they regarded this cruel class oppression and exploitation as a matter of course, as "truth." Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our millions of liberated serfs in Tibet overthrew the feudal serf system, seized power, became masters of our own affairs, and built socialism. This is our truth, this is the truth that conforms to the proletarian revolution and the interests of more than 95% of the people, this is the truth of Mao Zedong Thought. Anti-Party black gang elements, clamoring about "Equality for all before truth," are vainly trying to make us give up class struggle so that they can exercise dictatorship over us. This is absolutely impossible to deceive us.
    Qiongda (Teacher at Rikaze Primary School): What is truth? Millions of serfs standing up is truth. In the old society, the serf owners crippled my arm, and five of my family's six members were murdered. I don't know how many more serfs and slaves were murdered throughout Tibet! All of these were caused by their "truth" and "equality." Today, they still want to bring that set of things out, disarm us ideologically, and put fetters and handcuffs on us again. Absolutely not. We young people in Tibet are very fond of reading Chairman Mao's books, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, and have improved our class identification ability. They vainly attempt to deceive the masses and confuse class boundaries, but we must keep our eyes open, resolutely draw a clear class boundary, and never forget class struggle.
    Xiao Qujia (Public Security Cadre of Zhada County, Ali Prefecture): The anti-Party black gang elements want us to sit on an equal footing with the class enemies, talk about freedom, talk about equality, which is really infuriating. When have the exploiting classes ever sat on an equal footing with us, the oppressed and enslaved people, ever talked about freedom, ever talked about equality? Today, the Party and Chairman Mao have led us to liberation, but the bourgeois representatives who have sneaked into the Party are clamoring for us to sit on an equal footing with the class enemies. What is this if not reactionary heresy? In the beginning, they spread poison everywhere, attacked the Party, and tried their best to suppress us, not allowing us to fight back, then they didn't talk about equality. Now, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up to expose and criticize their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, but they are shouting "equality" with every breath. To them, we resolutely "treat them in the same way as they treat others," not allowing them to talk or act recklessly, and we must thoroughly settle accounts for their crimes.
    Zhanzha (Head of Deboji Township, Bange County, Naqu Prefecture): "Equality for all before truth," this is simply nonsense! I remember when I was sixteen, I was so hungry that I had no choice but to pick up a few wild duck eggs by the lake to eat, and I was caught by the serf owner and severely beaten, and I was also driven out of Deboji grassland and not allowed to go home. Anti-Party black gang elements, is this truth? Is this equality? They oppose our great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the proletarian dictatorship. We are determined to fight them to the end.
    Pajia (Cadre of Milin County, Lhasa City): I am a Lhoba person. In the past, under the evil feudal serf system, we Lhoba people could only hide in the deep mountains and old forests where there was little sunlight, cultivate the land with knives and burn it, and were worse than cattle and horses. At that time, we did not understand the principles of class oppression and class struggle, and really thought that this was our fate. The Tibetan revolution opened my eyes, and Chairman Mao's books illuminated my thoughts. Only then did I suddenly realize that the suffering in the past was due to the oppression and exploitation of the serf owner class; today's happy life is due to the working people mastering state power. What truth, what equality, are all determined by class and class struggle. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to eliminate all their reactionary fallacies.

    百万农奴站起来就是真理
    西藏自治区干部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议代表座谈驳斥资产阶级“权威”所谓“在真理面前人人平等”的谬论
    道吉才让（山南专区加查县县长）：钻在党内的资产阶级代表人物，一再叫喊“在真理面前人人平等”，这跟恶狼唱山歌一样。他们妄图用这个资产阶级的反动口号，来抹煞马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的核心——阶级和阶级斗争的学说。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”真理是有阶级性的。历史事实和生活经验都说明从来没有超阶级的真理，两个敌对阶级之间也从来没有过平等。过去，西藏三大领主把农奴当作牛马使唤，他们却把这种残酷的阶级压迫和阶级剥削说成天经地义，看作“真理”。在党和毛主席领导下，我们西藏百万翻身农奴推翻了封建农奴制度，掌握了政权，当家作主，建设社会主义。这是我们的真理，这是符合无产阶级革命和百分之九十五以上人民利益的真理，这是毛泽东思想的真理。反党黑帮分子们，叫嚷什么“在真理面前人人平等”，就是妄想使我们放弃阶级斗争，由他们来专我们的政。这是绝对骗不了我们的。
    穷达（日喀则小学教师）：什么是真理？百万农奴站起来就是真理。在旧社会，农奴主把我的手臂打残废了，我家六口人被害死了五口，全西藏的农奴和奴隶被害死的更不知有多少！这些都是他们那个“真理”和“平等”造成的。今天，他们还想把那一套搬出来，解除我们的思想武装，重新给我们带上脚镣手铐，绝对办不到。我们西藏青年非常喜欢读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，提高了阶级识别能力。他们妄想欺骗群众，混淆阶级界限，我们就要擦亮眼睛，坚决划清阶级界限，时刻不忘阶级斗争。
    小曲加（阿里专区札达县公安干部）：反党黑帮分子要我们跟阶级敌人平起平坐，讲自由，讲平等，实在叫人气愤。剥削阶级什么时候跟我们被压迫被奴役的人平起平坐过，讲过自由，讲过平等？今天，党和毛主席领导我们翻身解放了，钻在党内的资产阶级代表人物却叫嚷要我们跟阶级敌人平起平坐，这不是反动的妖言邪说是什么？当初，他们到处大量放毒，向党进攻，竭力压制我们，不准我们反击，他们就不讲平等嘛。现在，广大工农兵起来揭发批判他们的反党反社会主义罪行，他们却口口声声地叫起“平等”来了。对他们，我们坚决“以其人之道，还治其人之身”，不准他们乱说乱动，而且要彻底清算他们的罪行。
    占扎（那曲专区班戈县德波吉乡乡长）：“在真理面前人人平等”，这简直是胡说！记得我十六岁那年，肚子饿得实在没办法，跑到湖边拣了几个野鸭蛋来吃，被农奴主抓去毒打了一顿，还把我赶出德波吉草场，不准回家。反党黑帮分子们，这是真理吗？这是平等吗？他们反对我们伟大的党中央和毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级专政，我们坚决跟他们斗争到底。
    帕加（拉萨市米林县干部）：我是珞巴人。过去在万恶的封建农奴制度下，我们珞巴人只能躲在阳光很少的深山老林里，刀耕火种，牛马不如。那时，我们不懂得阶级压迫和阶级斗争的道理，还真以为是命该如此。西藏革命打开了我的眼界，毛主席的书照亮了我的思想。这才恍然大悟，过去受苦受难，是由于农奴主阶级压迫剥削；今天生活幸福，是由于劳动人民掌握了政权。什么真理呀，平等呀，统统都是由阶级和阶级斗争来决定的。我们要用毛泽东思想作武器，扫除他们的一切反动的谬论。
