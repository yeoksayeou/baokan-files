    After graduating from junior high school, I returned to my hometown to participate in agricultural production. When I was in school, I loved art, and after returning to the village, in my spare time from labor, I would often open my sketchbook and aimlessly copy portraits to paste on the wall. Later, the team leader saw that I could draw, so he asked me to paint the village history, including a section on my family history. When I painted how my father was forced by the landlord to leave his home and flee into the barren mountains in the old society, I deeply hated the landlord and the old society. Therefore, I painted the village history with special care, which was praised by the masses. Afterwards, our village organized an art group, under the leadership of the Party branch, to study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and discussed the gains from painting the village history comic strips. This made me more clear about the purpose of painting, which must serve proletarian politics and serve socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Our village art group, in coordination with political movements and the central task of production, carried out various forms of art creation activities. During the busy season of summer harvest, we published a "Summer Harvest Pictorial"; we also made slides of good deeds and good people in our village and other villages to show to the villagers; and we also turned some things that should be criticized or praised in our village into poems and paintings on the blackboard newspaper. The villagers like these forms very much.
    Last autumn, some children in our village went to the production team's fields to break off corn stalks and eat them as sugarcane. So I drew a picture called "Don't Eat Sweet Stalks" and added a few lines of poetry: "Whose child is so naughty, eating sweet stalks with a smiling face, wasting a lot of food, and he still feels very proud. Who should be responsible? Don't blame the child, blame the parents." As soon as this poem and painting were posted, it was supported by the villagers. Since then, the children in our village rarely broke off sweet stalks. During the summer harvest last year, the members of the fifth production team in our village, in order to support national construction, threshed, dried, and sold grain to the state overnight after the first batch of wheat was harvested. I praised the fifth team in the "Summer Harvest Pictorial." Under the leadership and influence of the fifth team, the whole village completed the summer harvest grain three days ahead of schedule. The fourth production team in our village managed the cotton fields carefully, and the fourth team was praised in the "Summer Harvest Pictorial." Since then, the fourth team has managed the cotton fields more carefully, and as a result, the yield has been greatly improved.
    In addition to general paintings, we also made the model deeds of the members of our village into slides and publicized them to the villagers. Our commune has a Huazhong Brigade, which is a village relying on the mountains, and most of the land planted is hillside land, which is easily washed away by heavy rain in the past. Last year, under the leadership of the Party branch, this village learned from Dazhai, managed mountains and rivers, and blasted stones to build embankments. The enthusiasm of the masses was soaring, and many heroes in mountain management emerged. Based on their deeds, I painted a set of fifteen slides called "Ode to Mountain Management Heroes" and showed them to the villagers. The masses of the Huazhong Brigade were greatly encouraged after watching the slides. They said: "The commune has praised us, and we must do our best in the future!"
    The Party branch often organizes us to study Chairman Mao's works and often educates us to be ahead of the villagers in labor. I work as an accountant in the production team while participating in labor, and use the evenings to paint. Last year, I coordinated with the summer harvest to make the "Summer Harvest Pictorial." I harvested wheat with the villagers for a day during the day, and after finishing the accounting at night, I started painting. My mother urged me to sleep, but I couldn't sleep. Many enthusiastic scenes in the labor moved me, and I felt that I was sorry for everyone if I didn't paint them. I painted for two consecutive nights in those few days, but I felt more happy than sleeping for three days. From my own practice in the past two years, I have come to this conclusion: the busier I am at work, the more I feel that there is something to paint, and the more I can understand the significance of my painting.

    画画是为政治服务
    陕西户县庞光公社社员　刘知贵
    我初中毕业后，回乡参加农业生产。我在学校念书时就喜爱美术，回村以后，在劳动空余，我常常翻开画本无目的地照样画些人像贴在墙上。后来大队长见我会画，便要我去画村史，其中有一段是我的家史。当我画到我父亲在旧社会被地主逼得离乡背井逃进荒山时，我十分痛恨地主，痛恨旧社会。因此我把村史画得特别细心，受到了群众的称赞。事后，我们村组织了美术小组，在党支部的领导下，学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，座谈了画村史连环画的收获。这样我更明确了画画的目的，一定要为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。
    我村美术组，配合政治运动和生产中心工作，开展了多种形式的美术创作活动。在夏收农忙时节，我们办了个《夏收画报》；又把本村和外村一些好人好事画成幻灯片给社员放映；还把本村的一些该批评或表扬的事在黑板报上搞成诗配画。社员同志们很喜欢这些形式。
    去年秋天，我村有些娃娃到生产队的地里折玉米秆，当甘蔗吃。我便画了一幅《不要吃蜜秆》的画，还配了几句诗：“谁家娃娃真淘气，嘴吃蜜秆笑迷迷，糟蹋粮食真不少，他还觉得很得意。要问责任该谁负？不怪娃娃怪父母。”这幅诗配画往出一贴就得到了社员们的拥护。从此，我村娃娃就很少去折蜜秆了。去年夏收期间，我村第五生产队社员为了支援国家建设，把头场麦子打完晒干，连夜交售公粮。我便在《夏收画报》上表扬了五队。在五队的带动和影响下，全村提前三天交完夏收粮。我村第四生产队对棉田管理得细，《夏收画报》上表扬了四队。从此四队把棉田管理得更加精心，结果产量有了很大提高。
    除一般的画以外，我们还把我村社员的模范事迹画成了幻灯片，向社员们进行宣传。我们公社有个化中大队，是个靠山的村子，种的多是山坡坡地，过去一下大雨就容易冲毁庄稼。这个村子去年在党支部领导下，学习大寨，治山治水，炸石垒堰，群众干劲冲天，出现了许多治山英雄人物。我根据他们的事迹画了《治山英雄赞》一套十五张幻灯片，给社员放映。化中大队群众看完幻灯后，受很大鼓舞。他们说：“公社表扬了咱，往后咱得使出大劲干咧！”
    党支部经常组织我们学习毛主席著作，经常教育我们要在劳动上走在社员前头。我在生产队里一边干会计工作，一边参加劳动，利用晚上来画画。去年我配合夏收搞《夏收画报》，白天和社员割了一天麦，晚上结完会计账，开始画画。母亲催我睡觉，但我总睡不着。劳动中许多热烈的图景激动着我，觉得不画出来好象对不住大伙。那几天我接连画了两个通宵，但我心里却比睡三天觉还愉快。从这两年来自己的实践中，我得出这样一个结论：劳动越忙，越感到有画头，越能体会到自己画画的意义。
