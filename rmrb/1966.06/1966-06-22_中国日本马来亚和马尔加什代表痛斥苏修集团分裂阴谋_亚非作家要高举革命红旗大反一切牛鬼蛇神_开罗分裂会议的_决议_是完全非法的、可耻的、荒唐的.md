    Xinhua News Agency, 21st - Representatives of Asian and African writers from China, Japan, Malaya, Madagascar, and other Asian and African countries attending the Asian-African Writers' Bureau's emergency meeting in Beijing, spoke to our agency's reporters today. With unparalleled anger, they strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for usurping the name of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau and basely and shamelessly illegally passing the so-called three "resolutions" to remove Secretary-General Senanayake from his post, move the Asian-African Writers' Bureau from Colombo to Cairo, and convene an illegal Asian-African Writers' Conference in Baku, Soviet Union, in August of this year. They unanimously pointed out that these three "resolutions" are splitting resolutions, illegal, shameful, and ridiculous, and are entirely a conspiracy by the Soviet revisionists to sabotage the cause of Asian-African people's unity against imperialism and serve U.S. imperialism. They expressed their firm opposition and strong protest.

    Ba Jin, Deputy Head of the Chinese Writers' Delegation, in his speech, severely condemned the conspiracy planned by the Soviet modern revisionists. He pointed out that the Cairo splitting conference exposed to the people of the world that the Soviet revisionists are traitors to the world revolution and public enemies of the Asian and African people. He said that those who convened the splitting conference, talked glibly about the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing being illegal, and about the Secretary-General of the Standing Bureau violating the law. In fact, the illegal and unlawful ones are precisely themselves, their splitting conference. They pieced together a small, utterly unimpressive group, held a secretive and hasty "emergency meeting" for two days, in whose service were they ultimately? The facts clearly show that they are serving their master, U.S. imperialism. The Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting in Beijing to support the Vietnamese people's struggle is what U.S. imperialism fears most. The people of the world warmly welcome such a revolutionary meeting. At this moment, the Soviet revisionists, who have infiltrated the ranks of Asian-African writers, cannot wait to come out and serve his master, and acted out such a splitting farce.

    Ba Jin said that the enemies of the people always overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. They brazenly said that they wanted to remove the Secretary-General, move the Standing Bureau to Cairo, and hold a meeting in the Soviet Union in August. What qualifications do you have to make these "resolutions"? In the end, they just want to undermine support for the Vietnamese people's struggle and put the Asian-African writers' movement on the track of serving "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," like the World Peace Council. We want to solemnly warn the Soviet modern revisionists, who are willing to be enemies of the Asian-African people, that your conspiracy will never succeed. The eyes of the Asian-African people and Asian-African writers are sharp. Your splitting activities and your sabotage conspiracies can only strengthen our unity. You yourselves do not make revolution, and you do not allow others to make revolution. This is impossible. We must hold a conference that holds the revolutionary red flag high; you surrender to U.S. imperialism, undermine the people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, and undermine support for the Vietnamese people's struggle, we must vigorously oppose U.S. imperialism, and we must resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle; we must not only vigorously oppose U.S. imperialism, but also vigorously oppose the modern revisionists who are accomplices of U.S. imperialism, and vigorously oppose you monsters and demons. Our revolutionary meeting with its clear-cut banner is not afraid of any shady schemes of you and your accomplices. Let you use all your tricks. The Chinese writers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will unite closely with all the anti-imperialist and revolutionary writers of Asia and Africa, fight you to the end, and let this small group of traitors be forever spurned by the Asian-African people.

    Japanese writer Yoshiken Yoda pointed out that the Cairo splitting conference and all the resolutions it passed are illegal. He said that there is a dark curtain behind the Cairo splitting conference. The Soviet modern revisionists gathered some of the most reactionary people in several countries to engage in this splitting conference and confront progressive forces.

    Yoshiken Yoda pointed out that the Cairo splitting conference wanted to make the Asian-African Writers' Conference subordinate to the secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo, and this practice itself is illegal. He said that holding the illegal Cairo conference not only wants to obstruct, disrupt, and split the Beijing conference, but also attempts to obliterate the history of the Asian-African people's struggle for independence. Their conference cannot succeed. What can succeed is only the Asian-African Writers' Conference truly striving for Asian-African national independence and liberation held in Beijing.

    Yoshiken Yoda emphasized that the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting is being held in China when the Cultural Revolution is underway, which has particularly important significance. As Chinese friends said, the Chinese Cultural Revolution is to sweep away all monsters and demons, and the Cairo splitting conference is monsters and demons. Soviet modern revisionism is the object of international cultural revolution.

    Yoshiken Yoda said that China has manufactured atomic bombs to support the world people's revolution, and the Cultural Revolution is manufacturing cultural atomic bombs. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese delegation will fully introduce the confident and active spirit of the Chinese people's Cultural Revolution at the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting.

    Malayan writer Sharma pointed out that the revisionists centered on Moscow are carrying out a series of illegal activities based on their U.S.-Soviet cooperation policy. They are doing their utmost to complete the complete betrayal of the national liberation movement of the oppressed countries and peoples, in order to achieve complete unity with imperialism and reactionaries headed by the United States.

    He said that on the eve of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting to be held in the base of the world's revolutionary people—the People's Republic of China—the Soviet revisionists attempted to create chaos and cause a split in the Asian-African national liberation movement, especially to undermine the support of the people of the world for the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle. However, the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs are destined to fail.

    He said that the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Meeting to be held here will surely achieve unprecedented victory. The Asian-African writers' movement and the Asian-African people's national liberation movement will surely move forward.

    Malagasy writer representative Andria said that the Cairo splitting conference passed the so-called three resolutions to remove Mr. Senanayake from his post, etc., which are absolutely illegal, and we firmly oppose them. Our Malagasy delegation expresses strong protest against this despicable behavior of the Soviet revisionists betraying the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa. He said that the Soviet revisionists tried every possible means to control all Asian-African revolutionary organizations, the purpose of which is to promote his revisionist line of uniting with U.S. imperialism and opposing revolution.

    Andria said that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for the Asian-African people and the people of the world to carry out revolutionary struggles. The Soviet revisionists hate Mao Zedong Thought very much. They unscrupulously sabotage Asian-African revolutionary organizations, which is actually against Mao Zedong Thought and against the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

    Andria then pointed out that the so-called resolutions passed by the Cairo splitting conference to hold an illegal Asian-African Writers' Conference in Baku in August of this year show that the Soviet revisionists have decided to split the ranks of Asian-African writers, undermine the cause of Asian-African people's unity against imperialism, and serve U.S. imperialism. In order to carry out a tit-for-tat struggle against the Soviet revisionists, our Malagasy writers' delegation firmly advocates removing the Soviet revisionists from Asian-African people's revolutionary organizations.

    中国日本马来亚和马尔加什代表痛斥苏修集团分裂阴谋
    亚非作家要高举革命红旗大反一切牛鬼蛇神
    开罗分裂会议的“决议”是完全非法的、可耻的、荒唐的
    新华社二十一日讯　出席亚非作家常设局在北京召开紧急会议的中国、日本、马来亚、马尔加什等亚非国家作家代表，今天向本社记者发表谈话，以无比愤怒的心情，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者盗用亚非作家常设局的名义，卑鄙无耻地非法通过所谓撤销森纳那亚克秘书长的职务，把亚非作家常设局从科伦坡搬到开罗，并在今年八月在苏联巴库召开非法的亚非作家会议等三项“决议”。他们一致指出，这三项“决议”是分裂的决议，是非法的、可耻的、荒唐的，完全是苏联修正主义者一手制造的破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业的为美帝效劳的阴谋诡计。他们表示坚决反对，强烈抗议。
    中国作家代表团副团长巴金在谈话中，严厉谴责苏联现代修正主义者一手策划的阴谋。他指出，开罗分裂会议在全世界人民面前暴露了苏联修正主义者是世界革命的叛徒，是亚非人民的公故。他说，召开分裂会议的人们，口口声声说什么在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议非法，说什么常设局秘书长违法。事实上，非法的和违法的恰恰是他们自己，是他们的分裂会议。他们拼凑一个实在不象样子的小班子，开了两天鬼鬼祟祟、草草收场的“非常会议”，究竟为谁效劳？事实清楚地表明，他们是在为他们的主子美帝国主义效劳。将在北京召开的支持越南人民斗争的亚非作家紧急会议，是美帝国主义最害怕的。全世界人民都热烈欢迎这样一个革命的会议。就在这个时候，混入亚非作家队伍的苏联修正主义者，竟迫不及待地出来为他的主子效劳，演了这样一出分裂的丑剧。
    巴金说，人民的敌人总是过高估计自己的力量，过低估计人民的力量。他们大言不惭地说什么要撤销秘书长职务啦，把常设局搬到开罗啦，还要八月里在苏联开会啦。你们有什么资格做这些“决议”？说来说去，无非要破坏支持越南人民的斗争，要把亚非作家运动象世界和平理事会那样纳入为“美苏合作主宰世界”服务的轨道。我们要正告甘心与亚非人民为敌的苏联现代修正主义者，你们的阴谋是永远不能得逞的。亚非人民和亚非作家的眼睛是雪亮的。你们的分裂活动，你们的破坏阴谋，只能加强我们的团结。你们自己不革命，也不准别人革命，这是办不到的。我们一定要开一个把革命红旗举得高高的大会；你们投降美帝，破坏人民反对美帝的斗争，破坏支持越南人民的斗争，我们一定要大反美帝，一定要坚决支持越南人民的斗争；我们不仅要大反美帝，而且还要大反美帝的帮凶现代修正主义者，大反你们这些牛鬼蛇神。我们这个旗帜鲜明的革命会议绝不害怕你们和你们同伙者任何见不得人的阴谋勾当。让你们把你们的花招全使出来吧，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国作家，要和全体亚非反帝的革命的作家紧密地团结在一起，同你们战斗到底，让你们这一小摄叛徒永远受到亚非人民的唾弃。
    日本作家依田义贤指出，开罗分裂会议和它所通过的一切决议都是非法的。他说，开罗分裂会议的后面是有黑幕的。苏联现代修正主义者纠集了几个国家里一些最反动的人搞了这个分裂会议，与进步力量相对抗。
    依田义贤指出，开罗分裂会议想使亚非作家会议从属于设在开罗的亚非人民团结组织书记处，这种作法本身就是非法的。他说，举行非法的开罗会议不仅是想阻挠、破坏和分裂北京的会议，而且是企图抹煞亚非人民争取独立的历史。他们的会议不可能取得成功。能够取得成功的只能是真正争取亚非民族独立和解放的在北京召开的亚非作家的会议。
    依田义贤强调说，亚非作家紧急会议在中国已在进行文化大革命的时候召开，具有特别重要的意义。正如中国朋友所说的，中国文化大革命是要横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，开罗分裂会议就是牛鬼蛇神。苏联现代修正主义是国际文化革命的对象。
    依田义贤说，中国为支援世界人民革命制造了原子弹，文化大革命是制造文化原子弹。因此希望中国代表团在亚非作家紧急会议上充分介绍中国人民充满信心的积极的文化大革命的精神。
    马来亚作家沙尔玛指出：以莫斯科为中心的修正主义者，根据他们的美苏合作政策进行一系列的非法活动。他们正在极力完成对被压迫国家和人民的民族解放运动的彻底背叛，以便和以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派取得完全一致。
    他说，即将在全世界革命人民的基地——中华人民共和国召开的亚非作家紧急会议的前夕，苏联修正主义者企图造成混乱，引起亚非民族解放运动的分裂，特别是想破坏全世界人民对越南人民反美斗争的支持。但是，苏联修正主义者和他们的走狗是注定要失败的。
    他说，将在这里举行的亚非作家紧急会议必将取得空前胜利。亚非作家运动和亚非人民的民族解放运动必将向前迈进。
    马尔加什作家代表安得列亚说，开罗分裂会议通过所谓撤销森纳那亚克先生职务等三项决议，是绝对非法的，我们坚决反对。对于苏联修正主义者这一背叛亚非革命人民的卑鄙行为，我们马尔加什代表团表示强烈的抗议。他说，苏联修正主义者千方百计地企图控制一切亚非革命组织，目的就是要推行他联合美帝国主义、反对革命的那条修正主义的路线。
    安得列亚说，毛泽东思想是亚非人民和全世界人民进行革命斗争的强大武器，苏联修正主义者对毛泽东思想十分仇恨，他们不择手段地破坏亚非革命组织，实际上是反对毛泽东思想，反对全世界人民的革命斗争。
    安得列亚接着指出，开罗分裂会议通过的所谓决议，要在今年八月在巴库召开非法的亚非作家会议，这表明苏联修正主义者已经决心分裂亚非作家的队伍，破坏亚非人民团结反帝的事业，为美帝国主义效劳。为了同苏联修正主义者进行针锋相对的斗争，我们马尔加什作家代表团坚决主张把苏联修正主义者从亚非人民革命组织中清除出去。
