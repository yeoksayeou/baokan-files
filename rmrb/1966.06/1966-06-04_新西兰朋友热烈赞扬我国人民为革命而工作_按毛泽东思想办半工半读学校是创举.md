    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd--Tom Newnham, editor of the New Zealand magazine "World Rural," told our agency reporter before leaving here to return home that the main reason for the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and construction is China's emphasis on the human factor, because "the Chinese people arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they find the source of action and motivation in Chairman Mao's works, and they work selflessly for the revolution."
    Tom Newnham is an educator with more than twenty years of experience. He warmly praised China's part-work, part-study education system.
    He said that the part-work, part-study schools established in China according to Mao Zedong Thought in order to cultivate successors to the revolutionary cause are a new creation in education. This kind of school, which combines theory and practice, has broad prospects.
    He said that these schools prevent the new generation from being detached from manual labor and make them love labor, preventing them from becoming intellectuals detached from manual labor. Chinese students cultivated under this education system all have a clear purpose in studying, and they all know that they are studying for the revolution.
    During his visit to China, Tom Newnham especially investigated the people's communes. He said: "Everything I have seen convinces me that the Chinese people's communes have indeed made great achievements, and the people's communes are a glorious victory."

    新西兰朋友热烈赞扬我国人民为革命而工作
    按毛泽东思想办半工半读学校是创举
    据新华社广州三日电　新西兰《世界农村》杂志总编辑托姆·纽纳姆在离开这里回国前对本社记者说，中国人民在社会主义革命和建设事业中取得惊人成就的主要原因是中国强调人的因素，是因为“中国人民用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，他们从毛泽东主席的著作中找到了行动的泉源和推动力，他们每一个人都为革命而忘我地工作。”
    托姆·纽纳姆是一位有二十多年历史的教育工作者。他热烈赞扬中国半工半读的教育制度。
    他说，中国为了培养革命事业的接班人，按照毛泽东思想创办的半工半读学校，在教育上是一个新的创举。这种理论与实践相结合的学校，有着广阔的前途。
    他说，这种学校使新的一代不脱离体力劳动并使他们热爱劳动，防止他们变成脱离体力劳动的知识分子。在这种教育制度下培养出来的中国学生，每一个人都有明确的学习目的，他们都知道为革命而学习。
    托姆·纽纳姆在中国访问期间特别考察了人民公社。他说：“我见到的一切事实使我深信，中国人民公社的确取得了巨大的成就，人民公社是一个光辉的胜利。”
