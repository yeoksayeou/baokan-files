    National Archery Championships Held in Xining City
    Li Shulan Breaks a Women's Single-Round Archery World Record
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th – Li Shulan, a renowned archery athlete from the People's Liberation Army, today achieved an outstanding score of 283 rings at the 1966 National Archery Championships, which commenced in Xining City, Qinghai Province. This breaks the world record of 279 rings for the women's 70-meter single-round archery event (total of 36 arrows). The previous record was set by Czechoslovakian athlete, Těptová, in 1962.
    This is the fifth world record broken by Chinese athletes in the first five months of this year.
    When this exciting news was announced at the Qinghai Provincial People's Stadium, the audience of all ethnic groups in the entire stadium immediately burst into cheers. People stepped forward to warmly shake hands with Li Shulan, presenting her with flowers and congratulating her on winning honor for the motherland once again.
    Twenty-one-year-old Li Shulan is an active element in studying Chairman Mao's works. Over the past few years, she has consistently and earnestly adhered to the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, establishing the ideology of shooting arrows for the revolution and serving the people. She has broken seven world records in the past. This time, when she came to Xining to participate in the competition, she encountered some new difficulties. Here, the altitude is more than 2,300 meters above sea level, the climate is changeable, and there are many strong winds. She was initially somewhat unaccustomed to it. At this time, she more actively studied Chairman Mao's works, adhered to the "Four Firsts," carried forward the "Three-Eight Work Style," demanded high standards from herself and rigorously trained before the competition. She finally overcame numerous difficulties. Today, she broke the women's 70-meter single-round world record for the first time and also broke the national record of 275 rings she and Shanghai athlete Sun Chunlan set last year.
    A total of seventy-six male and female athletes from eight units, including the People's Liberation Army, Shanghai, Shandong, Fujian, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Qinghai, are participating in this archery championship. The shooting distances for the women's competition are 70 meters, 60 meters, 50 meters, and 30 meters. The shooting distances for the men's competition are 90 meters, 70 meters, 50 meters, and 30 meters. All competitions will conclude on the 7th.

    全国射箭锦标赛在西宁市举行
    李淑兰破一项女子单轮射箭世界纪录
    新华社西宁四日电　解放军著名射箭选手李淑兰今天在青海省西宁市开始举行的一九六六年全国射箭锦标赛中，以二百八十三环的优异成绩，打破了女子七十米单轮射箭（共射三十六箭）二百七十九环的世界纪录。原来的纪录是捷克斯洛伐克选手台普托娃在一九六二年创造的。
    这是我国运动员在今年头五个多月中打破的第五项世界纪录。
    当这个令人兴奋的消息在青海省人民体育场宣布时，全场各族观众立即欢腾起来，人们纷纷走上前去同李淑兰热烈握手，向她献花，祝贺她又一次为祖国赢得了荣誉。
    二十一岁的李淑兰是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。几年来，她一贯认真坚持活学活用毛主席著作，树立了为革命射箭，为人民服务的思想，曾经打破七项世界纪录。这次她来到西宁参加比赛，遇到了一些新的困难。这里拔海两千三百多米，气候多变，风多风大，她开始有些不适应。这时，她更加积极地学习毛主席著作，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，从难、从严要求自己，在赛前刻苦练习，终于冲破了重重困难，在今天第一次打破了女子七十米单轮的世界纪录，同时打破了她和上海选手孙春兰在去年创造的二百七十五环的全国纪录。
    参加这次射箭锦标赛有解放军、上海、山东、福建、内蒙古、新疆、西藏和青海共八个单位的七十六名男女选手。女子比赛的射程是七十米、六十米、五十米和三十米。男子比赛的射程是九十米、七十米、五十米和三十米。全部比赛将在七日结束。
