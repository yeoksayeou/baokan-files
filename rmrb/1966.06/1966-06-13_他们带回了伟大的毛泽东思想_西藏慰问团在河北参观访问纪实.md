    They Brought Back the Great Mao Zedong Thought
    —A Record of the Visit to Hebei by the Tibet Comfort and Support Group
    Having traveled thousands of miles to deliver horses to the earthquake-stricken areas of Xingtai, Hebei Province, the Tibet Comfort and Support Group has successfully completed its mission and is about to return to Tibet.
    They came laden with the class friendship of a million emancipated serfs and returned laden with an even more precious "gift" from the people of Hebei. They not only brought back the profound class feelings of the masses in the disaster area and the spirit of Hebei people's strong support for Tibet in spirit and material but also the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and determination to follow the socialist road, the Mao Zedong's thought on people's war, and the new landscape of China's industrial and agricultural construction. In short, they brought back the great Mao Zedong Thought from Hebei Province. As the serf-born Tibetan brother Dunzhu aptly put it: "We brought the sentiments of a million emancipated serfs and took away the valuable experience of Hebei class brothers in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. After returning, we will use these valuable experiences to build a new socialist Tibet under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao."
    Bring Back the Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance and Hard Work
    During their visit to Hebei, the Tibetan brothers were most deeply impressed by the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the Hebei people.
    After arriving in the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai, what the Tibetan brothers saw and heard completely exceeded their expectations. They had originally imagined a scene of rubble, but what they actually saw were, in addition to some simple houses, a number of new houses that were flood-resistant and earthquake-resistant. In the vast plains, wheat was golden, and spring seedlings were thriving. The speed with which the people in the disaster area were restoring and developing production and rebuilding their homes exceeded people's expectations. Where was the key? After visiting the Qianhuying Brigade, the Tibetan brothers found a clear answer to this question.
    The Qianhuying Brigade of the Qianhuying Commune in the earthquake-stricken area was a brigade that had suffered severe earthquake damage. However, the wheat here grew much better than in previous years. The Party branch secretary of this brigade told the Tibetan brothers that after the earthquake, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were very concerned and sent the People's Liberation Army, medical teams, and work teams. Class brothers from all over the country provided enthusiastic and valuable support. These played an extremely important role in fighting the disaster. However, more importantly, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of all parts of the country, we held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and conscientiously implemented the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee of self-reliance, hard work, developing production, and rebuilding our homes. After the earthquake, the members of our brigade repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great call for self-reliance and ample food and clothing. People said that support is limited, but production is infinite; work hard, and difficulties will retreat. This is indeed the case. After the disaster, relying on our own hands, we will not only fight for a bumper summer harvest but also fight for a new socialist countryside.
    The Tibetan brothers not only saw this revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work in the earthquake-stricken area but also felt this valuable spirit of the Hebei people when visiting other communes and brigades.
    The Nanhui Brigade of the Xihuangcun Commune in Xingtai County suffered a mountain flood in 1963, which washed away half of the village and destroyed 70% of the land. In the face of such a serious disaster, the cadres and commune members carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, restoring and developing production and rebuilding their homes. The commune members said: The road is made by people, and difficulties are overcome by people. A difficulty as small as a needle seems larger than a steel beam to the timid; a difficulty as great as the sky seems smaller than a clod of earth to the ambitious, who can kick it away with one foot. The people of Nanhui used this spirit to fight against nature, fight against difficulties, and fight against people's erroneous thoughts, and finally fought out a new Nanhui. The houses here have become new, the mountains have become green, and the vast sandy and gravel beach has become irrigated farmland, with grain output increasing many times over. After the Tibetan brothers visited the "Education Beach" and "Education Mound" left by this brigade as a memorial, which were traces of the flood, they were deeply moved by the spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the people here.
    The Shashi峪 (Shashi Valley) Brigade of the Yuegezhuang Commune in Zunhua County, surrounded by mountains, is a poor place with "soil like pearls and water like oil, and large stones all over the mountains." In order to change the natural landscape here, commune members would bring back a bag of soil every time they went out and returned to the village. It was with this spirit that people transformed the barren hills and achieved tremendous success in changing the world.
    After learning about this situation, the Tibetan brothers, when they went to visit, some packed soil in schoolbags, and some draped soil in Tibetan robes. Gonga, a Tibetan youth who had been a beggar, took off his Tibetan robe and draped a full forty or fifty pounds of soil, carrying it on his shoulder. He said: "The People's Commune is the broad road to happiness for us poor people, and I want to add more soil to it."
    When the guests climbed halfway up the northern mountain, Zhang Guishun, the Party branch secretary of the Shashi峪 Brigade, pointed to two lines of poetry on a stone tablet and introduced them: This is the successor farmland cultivated by the youth, and the soil was all carried from the foot of the mountain. It takes more than a thousand loads of soil to cushion one mu of land, traveling more than ten thousand li back and forth, so the youth wrote these two lines of poetry: "Ten thousand li and a thousand loads for one mu of land, creating high yields on the bluestone slab." Zhang Guishun said that not only this piece of land but also all of the more than 1,200 mu of land and more than 6,600 plots of land in the entire brigade have been cushioned in this way.
    The Tibetan brothers were very excited when they heard this. They also poured the soil they brought into the field. Zhang Guishun said: Comrades have come from afar and brought us soil. This is a huge encouragement to us. Pour it all on the stone slab on the side of the dam wall. Open another road there and call it "National Unity Field" as a permanent memorial.
    Dunzhu, director of the Township Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, poured down the soil he brought and turned back to collect some soil from the youth's successor farmland, and at the same time picked up a stone, carefully wrapping it in his towel. He said that taking a little soil and a stone from here means that we want to take away the revolutionary spirit of the Han brothers in Shashi峪. We want to learn from their spirit to build Tibet. Luozha, who came from a poor herdsman family, wrote the following words in Tibetan in Zhang Guishun's notebook: "Use the spirit of Shashi峪 to create high yields on the bluestone slab in Tibet."
    Bring Back the Revolutionary Will to Persist in Taking the Socialist Road
    The firm revolutionary will of the Hebei people to listen to Chairman Mao and persist in taking the socialist road greatly encouraged the Tibetan brothers.
    When visiting the Xipu Brigade of the Jianming Commune in Zunhua County, the Tibetan brothers witnessed the earth-shaking changes that had taken place in this brigade. What individual households could not do was done by the elementary cooperative; what the elementary cooperative could not do was done by the advanced cooperative; what the advanced cooperative could not do was done by the People's Commune. Wang Guofan introduced to the Tibetan brothers: "Take the construction of reservoirs, for example. It was never possible to build them when there was only one village and one cooperative. Now, not only have they been built well, but they are also being used. The water stored in the reservoir can irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land. In addition, there are electric motors, water pumps, chaff cutters, flour mills, and other machines. When we first embarked on the road of collectivization, we only had three donkey legs. Now, the entire brigade has developed more than 400,000 yuan of public accumulation. The mountains have turned green, the land has become fertile, and grain output has increased nearly tenfold compared to individual production..."
    Wang Guofan pulled out the donkey that had been used to run the "Poor Stick Cooperative" with "three donkey legs" in those years and introduced it to the people. He said: This is the donkey. Since 1957, we have let it "retire." The Tibetan brothers stood beside the donkey, with a row of new brick houses of the People's Commune behind them, and let the reporter take this historically significant shot. This is a shot showing the 23 poor peasant households adhering to the socialist road, and it is a shot showing the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune. The Tibetan brothers said: In a few years, we will have such shots appearing all over Tibet, and we will be the pioneers in creating such shots.
    Wang Guofan pointed to the clothes and furniture that Wang Sheng, one of the 23 poor peasant households, wore and used when he was begging before liberation, which were displayed in the village history museum, and introduced them to the Tibetan brothers. He especially picked up a broken basket and told people: This is the furniture that followed Wang Sheng to beg for food for 24 years.
    People walked into Wang Sheng's home, and five tall and large new brick houses and two short and small old thatched houses were very clearly reflected in their eyes. Wang Sheng and his wife pointed to the old thatched houses and said to the Tibetan brothers: These are the two broken houses we used to live in. We couldn't avoid the wind and snow in winter, and we couldn't avoid the rain in summer. We suffered for most of our lives, and we didn't even build a decent house. After liberation, we organized ourselves, and then we built a new house, got electric lights, bought a radio, and didn't have to worry about food and clothing. Life is so good! This is all thanks to Chairman Mao and the People's Commune! The Tibetan brothers nodded again and again as they listened and watched. When the guests were about to leave, Wang Sheng held a bag of corn seeds and said to the Tibetan brothers with deep emotion: Although we are thousands of miles apart and speak different languages, we are all poor people. Poor people all over the world are one family. Brothers have come to our place from afar. We have nothing else to send. Take back the excellent variety of Zunhua 'Dongling White' corn and let it blossom and bear fruit on the Tibetan Plateau.
    Dangzhen, who came from a serf family, took the seeds and said: Comrade Wang Sheng gave us the seeds of crops, the seeds of the 23 poor peasant households running the cooperative, and also the seeds of the emancipated serfs making revolution under the leadership of the Party. We must let it take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit in Tibet. Together with our Han brothers, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will build a great socialist motherland side by side.
    After the visit, Aqin, a Tibetan singer from a poor herdsman family, immediately composed a song called "Long Live the People's Commune" and sang loudly:
    "Communism is heaven, the People's Commune is a bridge, the red flag of the commune, shakes the world and shines with golden light, we must plant the red flag of the People's Commune all over Tibet."
    Bring Back Mao Zedong's Thought on People's War
    On June 2, the Tibet Comfort and Support Group visited the "Red Flag Militia Battalion" of the Guozhuang Brigade of the Guozhuang Commune in Wuji County. Fully armed militiamen and all commune members, waving colorful flags, welcomed the Tibetan brothers into the drill ground. Male and female militiamen demonstrated grenade throwing and live-fire shooting to the Tibetan brothers.
    After the live-fire shooting, the Tibetan brothers scrambled to shake hands with Gao Yuerong and Lü Meihua, two sharpshooter girls. The old Tibetan man Youjia squeezed through the crowd, holding Gao Yuerong with one hand and Lü Meihua with the other. He said: "Your marksmanship is so good, it has increased the prestige of us poor people." He took the gun from Gao Yuerong and said happily: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, weapons are really in our hands. The Deng Tuo gang in the interior and the Dalai and Panchen reactionaries in Tibet, even though I am old, we must overthrow them and defend our socialist country." San丹旺姆 (San Dan Wangmu), a Tibetan female veterinarian, also signed each other with Gao Yuerong and Lü Meihua as souvenirs. San丹旺姆 (San Dan Wangmu) wrote: Learn from you, our Tibetan sisters must also arm ourselves. Long live Chairman Mao's thought on people's war!
    After returning from the shooting range, Wang Junsheng, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, led the Tibetan brothers to visit the Guozhuang Exhibition Hall. Here, the Tibetan brothers saw the combat deeds of the Guozhuang militiamen cooperating with the regular army in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, saw the Guozhuang militiamen bravely and skillfully defeating the enemy and seizing a large number of trophies with土枪 (earth guns),土炮 (earth cannons), broadswords, and spears, and they deeply felt the great power of the people's war. They expressed their admiration for Mao Zedong's thought on people's war and for the brilliant achievements made by the Guozhuang Militia Battalion in implementing Mao Zedong's thought on people's war.
    Before leaving, Wang Junsheng, the Party branch secretary and political instructor of the militia battalion, presented the Tibetan brothers with pictures wrapped in red silk, including the entire content of the Guozhuang Militia Exhibition. He said that the Tibetan brothers traveled over mountains and rivers, enduring all kinds of hardships, to send us horses, bringing us inestimable political strength. We rushed to copy a set of all the pictures of the Guozhuang Militia Exhibition overnight and gave them to the Tibetan brothers as a souvenir.
    Dunzhu, director of the Township Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, accepted the pictures on behalf of the Comfort and Support Group, saying: "The brothers in Guozhuang have given us a priceless gift, given us the experience of mastering the gun barrel and the knife handle, and given us the experience of implementing Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. After returning, we must learn from the experience of Guozhuang, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, arm the million emancipated serfs, work hard to hone our skills in killing the enemy, and be sure to guard the gate of the southwest border of the motherland."
    Bring Back the New Landscape of China's Industrial Construction
    When the Tibetan brothers visited the industrial production and construction of Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and other cities, they were warmly welcomed by the workers of various units. People beat gongs and drums and sang and danced. Factories and workshops were full of slogans welcoming the Tibetan brothers and learning from the noble communist style of the Tibetan brothers.
    In Tianjin, the Comfort and Support Group visited steel mills, carpet factories, watch factories, and automobile manufacturing plants. When the Comfort and Support Group visited the automobile repair factory, the workers let the Tibetan brothers sit on one new jeep after another that had just been assembled and drove them outside the factory. The Tibetan brothers held the hands of the worker brothers tightly and refused to let go for a long time. Langcuo, who came from a serf family, said: "I have ridden in the Liberation brand trucks made by the motherland, and I have ridden in the trains made by the motherland. The day before yesterday, when I visited the Tanggu New Port, I also rode in the ships made by the motherland. In Tibet, the reactionary headmen said that we would not be able to make cars. Today, I am sitting in the cars made by my own class brothers, and I feel really proud. The working class of the motherland is really great." The workers said repeatedly that we have only done a little work that we should do, and we are still far from the requirements of the Party. We must use the communist spirit of the Tibetan brothers who sent horses thousands of miles to make the cars even better.
    In the Tianjin Synthetic Fiber Factory, the Tibetan brothers were deeply attracted by the pure white elastic nylon silk. The workers who were operating in the workshop cut off sections of the thread and gave them to the Tibetan brothers, asking them to try the tensile force with their own hands. It took a lot of effort to break a very thin thread. When people learned that this was the raw material for making nylon stockings, their emotions became even more excited. Gonga, who came from a beggar's family, said excitedly: In the past in Tibet, the British took nylon stockings and mocked us, saying that we were stupid and that we wouldn't know how to make them even if they told us the technology. Today, our working class, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, has finally made them, increasing the ambition of us Chinese people. He couldn't help shouting: Long live the socialist motherland! Long live Chairman Mao! When leaving the factory, the Tibetan brothers wrapped the nylon threads given by the workers layer by layer, indicating that they would take these gifts back to Tibet and let the Tibetan people learn well from the spirit of self-reliance of the workers and elder brothers and build a new Tibet.
    Bring Back the Class Feelings of the People of Hebei
    In Hebei, the Tibetan brothers received kind care and warm hospitality everywhere. They repeatedly stated that they would bring back the profound class feelings of the people of Hebei and tell them to the million emancipated serf brothers.
    The Tibet Comfort and Support Group went to the Xingtai disaster area and made a special trip to visit the Qianhuying Brigade of the Qianhuying Commune, which had suffered a severe earthquake. When the commune members heard that class brothers from afar were coming to visit, some old women hurriedly slaughtered chickens and cooked dishes to warmly entertain the Tibetan compatriots.
    After the Tibetan brothers arrived in Qianhuying, the eighty-year-old poor peasant Qi Hongchen held the hands of the Tibetan brothers tightly and said: We have been waiting for you! Let's go, let's go home and sit down. Although the language was not understood, the Tibetan brothers were moved to tears when they saw the old man's expression.
    Chi Lai, who had been a serf for twenty-seven years, came to Qi Wanying's home and listened to the difficult experience of this class brother who grew up begging for food. He couldn't help saying: "My father was an old serf, and he was tortured to death by the evil serf system. I took my father's place when I was ten years old and became a slave, and I worked for twenty-seven years. The suffering of the old society is deeper than the sea. The hatred of the old society is greater than the Tanggula Mountains. Although we are thousands of miles apart, we are all bitter gourds on the same vine..." They were talking about their families and jointly condemning the evil old society.
    Qi Wanying's wife cooked the meal and brought the snow-white steamed buns and scrambled eggs to the table and said: "Poor people all over the world are one family. Let's have a reunion dinner today. The meal was given by Chairman Mao, and the dishes were also given by Chairman Mao. In order to thank him, we must eat it properly." Chi Lai felt warm in his heart as he listened. He said that apart from the difference in food, he could not feel that he was a guest in the home of Han brothers thousands of miles away.
    The class feelings of the people in the disaster area moved all the Tibetan brothers in the Comfort and Support Group. When the Tibetan brothers were about to leave, many old women sent them out with tears in their eyes. The poor peasant commune member Qi Jincang gave a new picture of Chairman Mao as a precious gift to the Tibetan brothers. Qiangba Tingjue, who came from a serf family, took the picture of Chairman Mao and held it to his chest and said: "Chairman Mao is our great savior. When I go back, I will buy a good frame and hang it up."
    During the visit, some of the class brothers in Hebei also gave the Tibetan brothers sickles,播种耧 (sowing machines), and bags of various kinds of seeds. Each gift was full of the deep feelings of class brothers!
    While the class brothers were giving gifts and class friendship, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee also took out a batch of materials to support the people of Tibet, including seven-inch步犁 (walking plows),山地犁 (mountain plows), water turbine pumps, two-wheeled handcarts, sickles, iron shovels, wool shears, wool grabbers, enamel basins, and Caucasian breeding sheep, and so on.
    When the Tibetan brothers returned to Tibet laden with the class feelings of the people of Hebei, the materials from the people of Hebei to support the Tibetan brothers were also about to be shipped. They, like the horses sent by the people of Tibet, will bring the hearts of the people of Hebei to the hearts of the million emancipated serf brothers.

### 他们带回了伟大的毛泽东思想——西藏慰问团在河北参观访问纪实

    他们带回了伟大的毛泽东思想
    ——西藏慰问团在河北参观访问纪实
    万里迢迢，为河北省邢台地震灾区送马的西藏慰问团胜利完成任务之后，即将返回西藏了。
    他们满载着百万翻身农奴的阶级情谊而来，又满载河北人民更珍贵的“礼物”而归。他们不仅带回了灾区群众深厚的阶级感情，和河北人民在精神上、物质上大力支援西藏的情谊，而且带回了自力更生、奋发图强，坚决走社会主义道路的革命精神，带回了毛主席的人民战争思想，带回了祖国工农业建设的新图景。总之，他们从河北省带回了伟大的毛泽东思想。农奴出身的藏族兄弟顿珠说得好：“我们送来的是百万翻身农奴的心意，带走的是河北阶级兄弟活学活用毛主席著作的活经验。回去后我们要用这些活经验，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，建设好社会主义的新西藏。”
    把自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神带回去
    藏族兄弟在河北的参观访问中，感受最深的首先是河北人民自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神。
    藏族兄弟到达邢台地震灾区以后，所见所闻，完全出乎意料之外。原来想象这里是一片瓦砾，可是他们亲眼看到的除部分简易房屋外，还有一批防洪抗震的新房。广阔的平原上，小麦金黄，春苗茁壮。灾区人民恢复发展生产和重建家园的速度，超出了人们的预料。关键在那里？藏族兄弟在访问过千户营大队以后，对这个问题得到了明确的回答。
    地震灾区的千户营公社千户营大队，是一个遭受了严重地震灾害的大队。但是，这里小麦却长得比往年好得多。这个大队的党支部书记对藏族兄弟们说，地震遭灾以后，党中央、毛主席十分关怀，派来了解放军、医疗队、工作队。全国各地的阶级弟兄，都给了热情可贵的支援。这些，对抗灾都起了极其重要的作用。但是，更重要的是我们在党的领导和全国各地的支援下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真执行了党中央提出的自力更生、奋发图强，发展生产、重建家园的方针，我们大队的社员们在地震以后，反复学习了毛主席提出的自己动手、丰衣足食的伟大号召。人们说，支援有限，生产无穷，干字当头，难字退位。事实正是这样。灾后，靠我们的双手，不光抗来了一个夏季大丰收，还要抗出一个社会主义的新农村。
    藏族兄弟不仅从地震灾区看到了这种自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，在访问其他社队的时候，同样感受到河北人民这种可贵的精神。
    邢台县西黄村公社南会大队，一九六三年山洪爆发，冲走了半个村子，冲毁了百分之七十的土地。在这种严重的灾害面前，干部社员发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，恢复发展生产，重建家园。社员们说：路是人走出来的，困难是人克服的。针大的困难，胆小的看来比钢梁还大；天大的困难，有志的人看来比土坷垃还小，一脚就能踢开。南会人就是用这种精神，与天斗，与难斗，与人的错误思想斗，终于斗出了个新南会。这里房屋变新了，山变绿了，白茫茫的沙石滩变成了水浇田，粮食产量成倍地增长。藏族兄弟参观了这个大队留作纪念的“教育滩”、“教育墩”等当时被山洪冲毁的痕迹以后，都深深为这里人民自力更生、奋发图强的精神所感动。
    群山环抱的遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，是一个“土如珍珠水如油、满山遍野大石头”的穷地方。社员们为了改变这里的自然面貌，外出回村，都要捎回一兜土。人们就是用这种精神，改造荒山，取得了改天换地的巨大的成绩。
    藏族兄弟了解到这个情况后，在去参观的时候，有的用书包装着土，有的用藏袍兜着土。要饭出身的藏族青年公卡，脱下自己的藏袍，兜了足足有四五十斤土，背在肩上，他说：“人民公社是我们穷人走上幸福的康庄大道，我要为它多添一把土。”
    当客人登上北山的半山腰时，沙石峪大队党支部书记张贵顺指着一块石碑上的两句诗介绍说：这是青年们搞的接班田，土都是从山下担上来的，垫一亩地得用一千多担土，往返共走一万多里路，所以青年们就写了这么两句诗：“万里千担一亩田，青石板上创高产。”张贵顺说，不光这一块地，现在全大队一千二百多亩地，六千六百多个地块，都是这么垫起来的。
    藏族兄弟们听了心情都很激动，他们把自己带来的土，也都倒到地里。张贵顺说：同志们远道而来，还为我们送土，对我们实在是个巨大的鼓舞，把它都倒到坝墙上边那道石板上吧，在那里另开一道，就叫“民族团结田”，作为永久的纪念。
    乡贫苦牧民协会主任顿珠，把自己带来的土倒下，又回身从青年接班田里收了些土，同时拣了块石头，用自己的手巾仔细地包好。他说，从这里带走一点土，带走一块石头，这表示我们要带走沙石峪汉族兄弟的革命精神，我们要学着他们的精神建设西藏。贫苦牧民出身的洛扎，用藏文在张贵顺的本子上写下了这样的话：“用沙石峪的精神，在西藏的青石板上创高产。”
    把坚持走社会主义道路的革命意志带回去
    河北人民坚定不移地听毛主席的话，坚持走社会主义道路的革命意志，给了藏族兄弟们很大鼓舞。
    藏族兄弟在访问遵化县建明公社西铺大队的时候，亲眼看到了这个大队发生的翻天覆地的变化，单干办不到的事，初级社办到了；初级社办不到的事，高级社办到了；高级社办不到的事，人民公社办到了。王国藩向藏族兄弟们介绍说：就拿修水库说，一村一社的时候，总修不起来，现在，不光修好，而且用上了。水库蓄的水，能浇两万多亩地。此外还有了电动机、水泵、铡草机、磨面机等各种机器。开始走合作化道路时只有三条驴腿，现在，全大队已发展到有四十多万元的公共积累。山变绿了，地变肥了，粮食产量比个体生产时增长了近十倍……
    王国藩把当年由“三条驴腿”办“穷棒子社”的那头驴拉出来，给人们介绍。他说：这就是那头驴，从一九五七年开始，我们就让它“退役”了。藏族兄弟们在毛驴身边，背依着一排排人民公社的新砖房，排列开来，让记者拍下了这个有历史意义的镜头。这是个表现二十三户贫农坚持社会主义道路的镜头，这是个显示人民公社无比优越性的镜头。藏族兄弟们说：几年以后，我们要让西藏各地都出现这样的镜头，我们这些人首先当创造这样镜头的开路先锋。
    王国藩指着村史馆里陈列的二十三户贫农之一王生解放前要饭时穿过的衣服，用过的家具，介绍给藏族兄弟看，他还特别把放着的一个破篮子举起来，告诉人们：这就是当年跟着王生要过二十四年饭的家具。
    人们走进王生的家，五间又高又大的新砖房和两间又矮又小的旧草房，非常鲜明的映入眼帘。王生和老伴指着旧草房向藏族兄弟说：这是我们过去住的两间破屋子，冬不避风雪，夏不避阴雨，苦熬了大半辈子，也没盖上间象样的房。解放后，组织起来，这才盖起了新房，有了电灯，买了收音机，不愁吃不愁穿，日子可好哩，这都是托毛主席的福，托人民公社的福啊！藏族兄弟们听着看着，都连连点头。客人们要走的时候，王生手托着一包玉米种，感情深重地向藏族兄弟说：“咱虽然相隔万里，语言不同，可都是穷人，天下穷人是一家，兄弟们远道来到我们这儿，没别的可送，把我们这遵化‘东陵白’玉米优良品种捎回去，让它在西藏高原开花结果吧。”
    农奴出身的当珍接过种子说：王生同志给我们的庄稼种子，是二十三户贫农办社的种子，也是翻身农奴在党的领导下，闹革命的种子。我们一定要让它在西藏生根长叶，开花结果。和汉族兄弟一起，在党和毛主席的领导下，并肩建设伟大的社会主义祖国。
    参观后，贫苦牧民出身的藏族歌手阿勤，立刻编了《人民公社万岁》这样一首歌词，放声高唱道：
    “共产主义是天堂，人民公社是桥梁，公社这面大红旗，威震四海，闪发金光，我们要把人民公社的红旗，插遍祖国的西藏。”
    把毛主席人民战争的思想带回去
    六月二日，西藏慰问团访问了无极县郭庄公社郭庄大队的“红旗民兵营”。全副武装的民兵和全体社员，挥舞着彩旗，把藏族兄弟迎进练武场，男女民兵向藏族兄弟表演了投弹、实弹射击。
    实弹射击完毕后，藏族兄弟们争着同高月荣和吕梅花两个神枪姑娘握手。藏族老汉由加在人群里挤过去，一手拉着高月荣，一手拉着吕梅花。他说：“你们的枪法这么好，长了咱穷人的威风。”他接过高月荣手中的枪，高兴地说：“在毛主席的领导下，武器真正到咱手了，内地的邓拓黑帮，西藏的达赖、班禅反动派，别看我老了，我们一定要打倒他们，保卫我们社会主义的江山。”藏族女兽医三丹旺姆还和高月荣、吕梅花互相签字留念。三丹旺姆写道：向你们学习，我们藏族姐妹也要武装起来。毛主席人民战争思想万岁！
    靶场回来，大队党总支书记王俊生领着藏族兄弟参观了郭庄展览馆。在这里，藏族兄弟们看到了郭庄民兵在抗日战争和解放战争中，配合正规军所进行的一次又一次的战斗事迹，看到了郭庄民兵当年用土枪、土炮、大刀、长矛，勇敢机智地打败敌人和缴获的大批胜利品，他们深深感到人民战争的伟大威力，对毛主席的人民战争思想，对郭庄民兵营执行毛主席人民战争思想所取得的光辉成就，表示钦佩。
    临别时，党总支书记、民兵营教导员王俊生把用大红绸子包着的包括郭庄民兵展览全部内容的图片，赠给了藏族兄弟。他说，藏族兄弟跋山涉水，历尽千辛万苦，为我们送马，给我们带来不可估量的政治力量。我们连夜突击复制了一套郭庄民兵展览的全部图片，送给藏族兄弟作纪念。
    乡贫苦牧民协会主任顿珠，代表慰问团接过了图片，他说：“郭庄的兄弟给了我们千金难买的礼物，给了我们掌握枪杆子、掌握刀把子的经验，给了我们执行毛主席人民战争思想的经验。回去后，我们要学习郭庄的经验，在党和毛主席的领导下，把百万翻身农奴武装起来，苦练杀敌本领，一定要把好祖国西南边疆的门口。”
      把祖国工业建设的新图景带回去
    藏族兄弟在参观天津、唐山、石家庄、邢台等市的工业生产建设时，受到各单位职工的热情欢迎。人们敲锣打鼓，载歌载舞。工厂、车间到处都是欢迎藏族兄弟，学习藏族兄弟高尚的共产主义风格的标语。
    在天津，慰问团参观了钢厂、地毯厂、手表厂和汽车制造厂。当慰问团参观汽车修造厂的时候，职工们让藏族兄弟们坐上刚刚装好的一辆又一辆的新吉普车，到厂外驶行，藏族兄弟们紧紧握住工人兄弟的手，久久不肯放开。农奴出身的郎措说：“祖国造的解放牌大汽车我坐了，祖国造的火车我坐了。前天参观塘沽新港，祖国造的轮船我也坐了。在西藏，反动头人说我们不会造小汽车，今天我又坐着自己阶级弟兄造的小汽车，我真感到自豪。祖国工人阶级真伟大。”工人们连声说，我们只是做了自己应做的一点工作，离党的要求还很远，我们要以藏族兄弟万里送马的共产主义精神，把汽车造的更好。
    在天津合成纤维厂，藏族兄弟被那洁白的弹力尼龙丝深深地吸引住了。正在车间操作的职工们，把一截截线头掐给藏族兄弟，请他们亲手试拉力。一根很细的线，就要使好大劲才能拉断。当人们知道，这就是做尼龙袜的原料时，情绪都更加激动。要饭出身的公卡激动地说：过去在西藏，英国人拿着尼龙袜嘲笑我们，说我们是呆人，告诉我们技术也不会做。今天，我们的工人阶级在党和毛主席的领导下，终于做出来了，长了我们中国人的志气。他情不自禁地高呼：社会主义祖国万岁！毛主席万岁！临出厂时，藏族兄弟们把职工们赠送的尼龙线用纸包了又包，表示要把这些礼物带回西藏，让西藏人民好好学习工人老大哥的自力更生精神，建设好新西藏。
    把河北人民的阶级深情带回去
    在河北，藏族兄弟处处受到了亲切的关怀和热情的招待，他们一再表示，要把河北人民深厚的阶级感情带回去，告诉给百万翻身的农奴兄弟。
    西藏慰问团到邢台灾区，专程慰问了遭受严重地震灾害的千户营公社千户营大队。社员们听到远道来的阶级弟兄要登门慰问，有的老大娘赶忙杀鸡做菜，热情招待藏族同胞。
    藏族兄弟们到了千户营以后，八十岁的老贫农齐洪臣老汉，紧握着藏族兄弟的手说：可把你们盼来了，走吧，快家去坐吧。尽管语言不通，藏族兄弟看着老人的表情，感动得流出了泪花。
    当过二十七年农奴的赤来，来到了齐万营家，听了这个要饭长大的阶级弟兄的苦难经历，也情不自禁地说：“我的父亲是个老农奴，他被万恶的农奴制度折磨死了。我十岁上就替了父亲的班，当了奴隶，一干就是二十七年。旧社会的苦比海深。旧社会的仇比唐古拉山大，咱们虽说相隔万里，可都是一根藤上的苦瓜……。”他们之间是在叙家常，也是在共同控诉万恶的旧社会。
    齐万营的老伴做好了饭，把雪白的馒头和炒鸡蛋端到桌上说：“天下穷人是一家，咱今天吃一顿团圆饭吧，饭是毛主席给的，菜也是毛主席给的。为了感谢他老人家，咱可得实实在在地吃。”赤来听着心里热乎乎的。他说，除了饭菜的差别，完全感觉不到这是在万里以外的汉族兄弟家里作客。
    灾区人民的阶级感情，使慰问团的藏族兄弟们无一不受感动。藏族兄弟们要告辞了，许多老大娘都含着热泪送出来。贫农社员齐金仓，把一张新的毛主席象，作为珍贵礼物，送给了藏族兄弟。农奴出身的强巴廷觉接过毛主席象，捧到自己胸前说：“毛主席是我们的大救星，我回去要买个好镜框镶上挂起来。”
    在参观访问期间，河北的阶级弟兄有的还送给了藏族兄弟镰刀，送给了播种耧，送给了一包又一包各种各样的籽种，每一件礼物都充满了阶级兄弟的深情！
    在阶级弟兄送礼物、送阶级情谊的同时，中共河北省委、河北省人民委员会还拿出了一批物资，支援西藏人民。其中有七寸步犁、山地犁、水轮泵、双轮手推车、镰刀、铁锨、羊毛剪子、羊毛抓子、搪瓷面盆以及高加索种羊，等等。
    当藏族兄弟满载着河北人民的阶级深情返回西藏的时候，河北人民支援藏族兄弟的物资，也即将起运了。它们要象西藏人民送来的马匹一样，把河北人民的心意，带到百万翻身农奴兄弟的心中。
