    New China News Agency, Havana, June 1st: On May 21st, a Cuban border guard was shot and killed by American aggressor troops at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo. On the evening of May 27th, the Cuban government announced that the Cuban armed forces and the entire nation were immediately placed on alert.

    According to a statement issued by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces on May 22nd, at 19:00 on May 21st, Cuban border guard soldier Ramirez Lopez was on duty inside a bunker at a Cuban outpost when he was shot and killed by U.S. soldiers from the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo. The Cuban outpost is located three kilometers south of the main entrance of the U.S. base and 150 meters from the eastern border of the U.S. base.

    Following the incident, on May 25th, the Cuban authorities organized more than thirty foreign journalists and dozens of Cuban journalists to visit the Cuban border line close to the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, to inspect the scene where the Cuban soldier was shot by the U.S. military, exposing the lies of the U.S. Department of Defense. The U.S. Department of Defense, in a statement on May 24th, falsely claimed that Cuban soldiers had entered the U.S. base in Guantanamo before U.S. soldiers opened fire. Subsequently, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense fabricated another story on May 27th, claiming that six more Cuban soldiers had entered the U.S. Naval Base area in Guantanamo on the evening of May 23rd and "exchanged fire" with U.S. sentries. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, at a press conference held the same day, stated that the U.S. would issue a so-called "protest" regarding this. Rusk also said, "My hope, my advice, is that the Cubans do not enter the base area, so that these incidents will not happen again. If they do, it would be good for all concerned."

    On the evening of May 27th, Prime Minister Castro urgently issued a statement saying that the U.S. Department of Defense's statement about Cuban soldiers intruding into the U.S. base in Guantanamo was "deceitful and fabricated." He said, "Perhaps under the cover of this fabricated and deceitful news, they are trying to create psychological conditions for launching an aggression against our country." On the same evening, he issued a second statement saying that the news that Rusk intended to issue a "protest" to Cuba confirmed the suspicion that "an imperialist aggression against our country may be being planned" behind the killing of the Cuban soldier. He said, "Mr. Rusk is actually threatening us with war," "What we must do immediately is to put our Revolutionary Armed Forces and the entire people on alert." After Prime Minister Castro issued the above two statements, President Dorticos immediately summoned the envoys of socialist countries. On behalf of the Cuban government, he explained "the serious situation arising from the recent U.S. provocations at the Guantanamo Naval Base," and then announced, "The Cuban government is prepared from now on to accept volunteers from fraternal countries who come to aid Cuba against the threat of U.S. imperialist aggression." At the same time, the General Staff of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces issued an order for all Cuban armed forces to enter a state of alert.

    On the evening of May 28th, the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party notified a press conference to be held. At the meeting, Cienfuegos, a member of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, issued a statement on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Executive Secretariat of the Organization for Solidarity with the Peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, calling on "the people of all countries in the world and Cuba's friendly countries and committees of all countries to send volunteers to Cuba from now on."

    Cuban radio and television have been continuously broadcasting the two statements of the Cuban Prime Minister and the news of the armed forces being placed on alert since the evening of May 27th. On May 28th, the Cuban newspaper *Granma* used the entire first page to publish a fifteen-line headline about the announcement of the state of alert and a huge photograph of Prime Minister Castro carrying a gun. Cuban newspapers also published statements from mass organizations expressing support for the Cuban Prime Minister's statement and numerous photographs showing the Cuban armed forces. The statement from the Union of Cuban Writers and Artists also called on Cuban writers and artists abroad to prepare to return home to fight.

    From May 28th, soldiers erected cannons on the Malecon in Havana, and military vehicles drove back and forth on the streets. At night, searchlights continuously shone into the sky.

    美帝对古巴人民的又一新挑衅
    新华社一日讯　哈瓦那消息：五月二十一日，一名古巴边防军哨兵被关塔那摩美国海军基地的美国侵略军开枪打死。二十七日晚，古巴政府宣布古巴武装部队和全国人民立即处于戒备状态。
    据古巴革命武装部在二十二日发表的一项声明，五月二十一日十九时，古巴边防军士兵拉米雷斯·洛佩斯在古巴哨所的掩体内值勤时，被关塔那摩美国海军基地的美国士兵开枪打死。古巴哨所位于美军基地的主要入口处以南三公里，离美国基地东边边界一百五十米。
    这一事件发生后，古巴当局在二十五日组织三十多名外国记者和数十名古巴记者到接近关塔那摩美国海军基地的古巴边防线上，参观了美军枪杀古巴哨兵的现场，揭露美国国防部的谎言。美国国防部在二十四日的声明中撒谎说，古巴士兵进入了关塔那摩美国基地，美国兵才开了枪。接着，美国国防部发言人在二十七日又捏造说，二十三日晚上，又有六名古巴士兵进入了关塔那摩美国海军基地地区，同美国哨兵“发生交火”。美国国务卿腊斯克在同天举行的记者招待会上表示，美国将对此提出所谓“抗议”。腊斯克还说什么，“我的希望，我的劝告是，古巴人不要进入基地地区，这样就不会再发生这些事件。如果他们会这样做，这对所有有关的人都会有好处。”
    五月二十七日晚上，卡斯特罗总理紧急地发表一项声明说，美国国防部关于古巴士兵侵入关塔那摩美国基地的声明是“骗人的和伪造的”。他说，“或许他们在这种伪造和骗人的消息的掩盖下，企图为对我国发动侵略制造心理条件。”在同一天晚上，他又发表了第二项声明说，腊斯克表示将向古巴提出“抗议”这个消息证实了这样的猜疑：即在杀害古巴士兵的事件的后面“可能正在策划对我国的帝国主义的侵略”。他说，“腊斯克先生实际上在用战争威胁我们”，“我们要立即做的事是让我们的革命武装部队和全体人民处于戒备状态。”在卡斯特罗总理发表了上述两项声明后，多尔蒂科斯总统立即召见社会主义国家使节。他代表古巴政府说明了“由于最近美国在关塔那摩海军基地的挑衅而出现的严重局势”，然后宣布，“古巴政府准备从现在起就接受前来援助古巴反对美帝国主义侵略威胁的兄弟国家的志愿人员。”与此同时，古巴革命武装部队总参谋部发布了古巴所有武装部队进入戒备状态的命令。
    二十八日晚，古巴共产党中央通知举行记者招待会。会上，古共中央委员西恩富戈斯以亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民团结组织执行书记处筹委会的名义发表声明，号召“世界各国人民和古巴的友好国家以及各国的委员会从现在起就派志愿人员到古巴去”。
    古巴广播电台和电视台从二十七日晚起连续不断地播送古巴总理的两项声明和武装部队处于紧急状态的消息。二十八日，古巴《格拉玛报》用整个第一版的篇幅刊登了十五行有关宣布戒备状态的标题和一张背着枪的卡斯特罗总理的巨大照片。古巴报纸还发表了一些群众组织表示支持古巴总理声明的声明和大量的显示古巴武装力量的照片。古巴作家和艺术家联合会的声明还号召在国外的古巴作家和艺术家准备回国作战。
    从五月二十八日开始，士兵们在哈瓦那的滨海大道架起大炮，军用车在大街上开来开去。入夜，探照灯不断地向空中照射。
