　　Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, May 5th. Graciela Righetti, a Mexican economist and prominent social activist who recently returned after a visit to China, told Xinhua reporters here on the 4th that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the greatest, most outstanding, and most precious wealth of the Chinese people, but also the greatest, most outstanding, and most precious wealth of the people of Latin America and the world.

　　In the conversation, Righetti emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is a universally applicable truth. She said that regarding Chairman Mao's works, the issue is not only translating them into various languages, but most importantly, applying Mao Zedong Thought based on the historical characteristics and specific circumstances of each country. She also said that Chairman Mao's analyses of various social classes, his works on the peasant movement and people's war, have practical and profound guiding significance for the current struggles of the Latin American people. Problems that the Latin American people cannot solve can all be found in Chairman Mao's works.

　　She further said that Chairman Mao's point that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world is an irrefutable truth. The oppressed and bullied people of Latin American countries must also unite to fight against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

　　When talking about the self-reliance policy implemented by China, Righetti said that this policy is a product of Mao Zedong Thought. She said that a country must not only be self-reliant in its construction, but also self-reliant in carrying out revolution. She said that in his article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," Chairman Mao pointed out that if the Foolish Old Man could dig away the two mountains blocking his family's way out, then the people of Latin America would certainly be able to dig away the mountains hindering their progress. Righetti said that Mao Zedong's point gave encouragement and strength to the people of Latin American countries who are engaged in revolutionary struggles.

　　Righetti said that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the achievements of socialist construction were due to the leadership of the great Mao Zedong Thought. She praised the Chinese people for their enthusiastic study of Chairman Mao's works. She said that once people master Mao Zedong Thought, they become the most intelligent, most capable, and most combative people, as evidenced by the achievements of the Chinese people in agriculture, industry, and science. Righetti emphasized that all of this was achieved by people who have raised their consciousness with Mao Zedong Thought.

　　Righetti finally said that he would continue to study Chairman Mao's works better and regard Chairman Mao's works as the only correct guide. (Attached picture)

    墨西哥著名人士里格特表示要更好学习毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想是拉美人民最伟大最宝贵财富
    拉丁美洲人民无法解决的问题都可在毛主席著作中找到答案
    新华社墨西哥城五日电　不久前访问中国后回国的墨西哥经济学家、著名社会活动家格拉谢拉·里格特四日在这里接见新华社记者时说，毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民最伟大、最卓越、最宝贵的财富，而且是拉丁美洲和全世界人民最伟大、最卓越、最宝贵的财富。
    里格特在谈话中强调指出，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。他说，对毛主席著作，不仅是译成各国语文的问题，最重要的是根据每个国家的历史特点和具体情况运用毛泽东思想。他又说，毛主席有关社会各阶级的分析、有关农民运动和人民战争的著作对拉丁美洲人民目前的斗争有现实而深刻的指导意义，拉丁美洲人民无法解决的问题都可以在毛主席的著作里找到答案。
    他又说，毛泽东主席所指出的美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人的论点是一个颠扑不破的真理。拉丁美洲受压迫、受欺侮的各国人民也要团结起来一起为反对共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    里格特在谈到中国所执行的自力更生的方针时说，这个方针是毛泽东思想的产物。他说，一个国家不仅在建设中必须自力更生，而且也必须自力更生地去进行革命。他说，毛主席在《愚公移山》这篇文章里指出，愚公可以挖掉挡住愚公家出路的两座大山，那末拉丁美洲人民就一定可以挖掉阻碍他们前进的大山。里格特说，毛泽东的这一论点给了正在进行革命斗争的拉丁美洲国家人民以鼓舞和力量。
    里格特说，中国人民革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就都是由于有了伟大的毛泽东思想的领导。他赞扬中国人民热烈学习毛主席著作。他说，人们一旦掌握毛泽东思想，就成为最聪明、最能干、充满战斗精神的人，其证明就是中国人民在农业、工业和科学事业中取得的成就。里格特强调说，所有这一切，是用毛泽东思想提高了觉悟的人民所取得的。
    里格特最后说，他将更好地继续学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的著作作为唯一正确的指针。（附图片）
