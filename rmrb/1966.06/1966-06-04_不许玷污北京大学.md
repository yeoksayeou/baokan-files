    Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades from the Philosophy Department of Peking University, using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, pierced through the black curtain of the "Three-Family Village" branch, exposing the ugly faces of the "Three-Family Village" gang members Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun to the broad masses of revolutionary people, making them the target of public criticism. This is a big-character poster of great revolution, another fierce cannonball fired at all monsters and demons.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall. It's the same as sweeping the floor. If the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away on its own." Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and other gang members who have long occupied Peking University are attempting to turn our socialist university into a position for them to spread bourgeois ideology, a place for them to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. In the current torrent of the Great Cultural Revolution, they are again using various tricks to suppress the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary young intellectuals and revolutionary teachers. We sternly warn these gang members: Your "Three-Family Village" headquarters has already been smashed to pieces by the revolutionary people, your commander-in-chief has fallen, and your branches will inevitably be submerged in the surging waves of the Great Cultural Revolution.
    Revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and staff comrades of Peking University! Bravely and resolutely wage a merciless struggle against all anti-Party and anti-socialist gang members, destroy their stubborn strongholds, and do not allow them to defile our Peking University, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition! We, the broad masses of commercial workers, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University and serve as your strong backing.
    Tian Mingyue and sixteen others from the Beijing Department Store

    不许玷污北京大学
    北京大学哲学系聂元梓等七位同志，用毛泽东思想的锐利武器戳穿了“三家村”分号的黑幕，使“三家村”黑帮分子宋硕、陆平、彭珮云的丑恶嘴脸暴露在广大革命人民群众的眼下，成为众矢之的。这是一张大革命的大字报，是对准一切牛鬼蛇神放出的又一发猛烈的炮弹。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”长期盘踞在北京大学的陆平、彭珮云这些黑帮分子，企图把我们的社会主义大学变成他们传播资产阶级思想的阵地，变成他们为复辟资本主义作舆论准备的场所。在当前文化大革命的洪流中，他们又诡计多端地企图把广大的革命知识青年和革命教师的革命热情压下去。我们正告这些黑帮分子们：你们的“三家村”总店已经被革命的人民砸得稀巴烂，你们的主帅已经垮台，你们的分店也必然要被淹没在文化大革命的汹涌澎湃的浪涛里。
    北大革命的同学们，革命的教师和职工同志们！勇敢地坚决地向一切反党反社会主义的黑帮分子作无情的斗争，摧毁他们的顽固堡垒，不许他们玷污我们有着光荣革命传统的北京大学！我们广大商业职工和全国工农兵群众一道，坚决支持北京大学无产阶级革命派，作你们坚强的后盾。
    北京百货大楼  田明月等十六人
