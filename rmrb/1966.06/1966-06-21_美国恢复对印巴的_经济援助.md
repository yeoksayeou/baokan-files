    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: State Department spokesman McCloskey announced on the 15th that the United States had decided to resume "economic aid" to India and Pakistan and had notified the governments of India and Pakistan of this decision.
    The United States announced the suspension of "aid" to India and Pakistan last September after India launched an aggression against Pakistan and Kashmir. Subsequently, the United States, in collusion with the Soviet Union, manipulated the United Nations to pass a resolution requiring the Indian aggressors and Pakistan to achieve a ceasefire in Kashmir, with the aim of obstructing the people of Kashmir from exercising their right to self-determination. Soon after, the Soviet Union further concocted a so-called "Tashkent Declaration."
    The State Department spokesman specifically stated in his announcement on the 15th that the United States made the decision to resume "aid" because "peace had been restored" in Kashmir. In fact, the United States had already resumed "aid" to India before announcing this decision.
    Pakistani newspapers recently condemned the United States for interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs by imposing preconditions for the resumption of "aid".

### 美国恢复对印巴的“经济援助”

    美国恢复对印巴的“经济援助”
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十五日宣布，美国决定恢复对印度和巴基斯坦的“经济援助”，并且已经把这个决定通知了印度和巴基斯坦政府。
    美国是在去年九月印度对巴基斯坦和克什米尔发动侵略之后，宣布停止对印度和巴基斯坦的“援助”的。接着，美国又伙同苏联操纵联合国通过一项要印度侵略者和巴基斯坦在克什米尔实现停火的决议，目的是阻挠克什米尔人民行使自决权。不久，苏联进一步炮制出一项所谓“塔什干宣言”。
    美国国务院发言人在他十五日的声明中特别说明，美国作出恢复“援助”的决定，是因为在克什米尔“恢复了和平”。事实上，美国在宣布这个决定之前，早已恢复了对印度的“援助”。
    巴基斯坦的报纸最近曾经谴责美国利用恢复“援助”提出先决条件，干涉巴基斯坦的内政。
