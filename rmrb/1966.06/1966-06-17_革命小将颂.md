    Revolutionary Young Generals: An Ode
　　Xin Wu
    In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's revolutionary youth are worthy of being a new generation educated by Chairman Mao. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to fiercely attack the bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities."
    Youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought have very keen political senses. Haven't the revisionist elements like Deng Tuo been constantly instilling bourgeois ideology into the youth, disguised as "good friends" and "mentors" of the youth? However, as early as two or three years ago, many young people saw through the poisonous weeds they released. Sun Mantun, a student in the Chinese Department of Northwest University, discovered in 1964 that "Yanshan Yehua" was anti-Party and anti-socialist code. Duan Qiming, a young teacher at Dongling Elementary School in Nanguan District, Changchun City, wrote articles criticizing "Yanshan Black Talk" more than a year ago and criticized the "Beijing Evening News" as a tool for the bourgeoisie to release poison. Under the circumstances that the "Beijing Evening News" shielded Deng Tuo, he did not compromise and kept urging him until he took the article to the "Changchun Daily" for publication in May of this year.
    Youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought despise bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities." Two years ago, students in Class 4 of Senior Grade 3 of Guangzhou No. 4 Middle School noticed the reactionary nature of Wu Han's "Tan Guqi" when they learned it in their Chinese class. The Chinese teacher said to them: "Wu Han is the deputy mayor of Beijing and a historian. Can he be wrong?" But they didn't care about this. After collective discussion, they unanimously affirmed that this was a large anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weed. What we obey is the truth of the proletarian revolution, and this truth is Mao Zedong Thought, not bourgeois "authorities." This is their answer.
    Youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a revolutionary spirit of fearlessness. Regardless of the fact that the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements have seized important positions in certain departments, and put the label of "anti-Party" on all those who oppose them, and searched for some lackeys to besiege the revolutionaries, this has not frightened the revolutionaries. The revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University, who resolutely struggled against revisionists like Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, are a typical example.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Cultural Revolution, with workers, peasants and soldiers as the main force, is smashing the thrones of all monsters and demons like a destructive force. Our revolutionary youth are vanguards and shock troops in this struggle. They have been tempered and are growing rapidly in the struggle.
    Isn't imperialism pinning its hopes on our third and fourth generations to restore capitalism in China? Aren't the "Three-Family Village" gang "brothers" fighting for our next generation? Then, please let them listen to what a young man said after visiting the exhibition of the study of Chairman Mao's works by the Lijiazhuang Youth League branch: We will never be successors of the bourgeoisie. In order to prevent the restoration of capitalism and the emergence of revisionism, I want to turn my life into a life of studying Chairman Mao's works and a life of revolution!
    Our revolutionary cause will be carried on by successors. Our communist ideals will surely be realized. A foreign friend who recently visited China said: "The United States seems to think that if China reaches the era of the next leader, it can expect it to take a softened attitude to cooperate with the United States. However, judging from China's rectification movement, it can also be known that this is just a wrong observation." This is correct. With Mao Zedong Thought and a generation of youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought, China will never change color.
    Youth are our hope. Chairman Mao described youth as the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought, our youth are growing and becoming stronger. We are happy to see that the vigorous sun is rising!

    革命小将颂
　　辛午
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，中国的革命青年不愧为毛主席教育出来的一代新人。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，敢想，敢说，敢干，敢于向资产阶级的“学者”“权威”们猛烈地开火。
    用毛泽东思想武装了头脑的青年，政治嗅觉非常敏锐。邓拓之流的修正主义分子，不是披着青年“良友”、“导师”的外衣，向青年们不断地灌输资产阶级思想吗？但是，早在二、三年前，就有不少青年识破了他们放出来的毒草。西北大学中文系学生孙曼屯，在一九六四年就发现《燕山夜话》是反党反社会主义的黑话。长春市南关区东岭小学的青年教师段奇明，一年多以前就写文章批判“燕山黑话”，并且批评《北京晚报》是资产阶级放毒的工具。在《北京晚报》包庇邓拓的情况下，他毫不妥协，步步紧催，到今年五月把文章拿到《长春日报》发表了。
    用毛泽东思想武装了头脑的青年，是蔑视资产阶级“学者”“权威”的。广州四中高三（四）班学生，两年前在语文课上学吴晗的《谈骨气》时，察觉到它的反动性。语文老师对他们说：“吴晗是北京的副市长，历史学家，还会错吗？”可是他们不管这一套，经过集体讨论，一致肯定这是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。我们服从的是无产阶级革命的真理，这个真理就是毛泽东思想，而不是资产阶级“权威”。这就是他们的回答。
    用毛泽东思想武装了头脑的青年，是有着革命的大无畏精神的。不管反革命的修正主义分子们窃据了某些部门的重要职位，给反对他们的人统统扣上“反党”的帽子，并且搜罗一些娄罗围攻革命者，但是这并没有把革命者吓倒。像北京大学的革命师生，对陆平、彭珮云这些修正主义分子坚决斗争，就是一个典型的例证。
    在党的领导下，以工农兵为主力军的文化大革命，正势如破竹地把一切牛鬼蛇神的宝座打得稀烂。我们革命的青年，在这场斗争中，是闯将，是突击手。他们得到了锻炼，他们正在斗争中迅速地成长起来。
    帝国主义不是把中国复辟资本主义的希望寄托在我们第三代第四代的身上吗？“三家村”的黑帮“兄弟”们不是在争夺我们的下一代吗？那么，请他们听一听一位青年在参观李家庄团支部学习毛主席著作展览后说的一段话吧：我们决不做资产阶级的接班人。为了防止资本主义的复辟和修正主义的产生，我要把我的一生，变成学习毛主席著作的一生，革命的一生！
    我们的革命事业是后继有人的。我们的共产主义理想是一定会实现的。最近访问中国的一位外国朋友说：“美国似乎认为，假如中国到下一个领导人的时代，就能够期望它采取同美国合作的软化的态度。但是，从中国的整风运动来看，也可以知道，这不过是错误的观察而已。”这段话说对了，有了毛泽东思想，有了以毛泽东思想武装起来的青年一代，中国是永远不会变色的。
    青年是我们的希望。毛主席把青年形容为早晨八、九点钟的太阳。我国青年在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在成长，在壮大。我们高兴地看到，朝气蓬勃的太阳正在上升！
