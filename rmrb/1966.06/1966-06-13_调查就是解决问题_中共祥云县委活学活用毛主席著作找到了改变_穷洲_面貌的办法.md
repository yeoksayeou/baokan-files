    "Investigation is Solving the Problem"
    —The CPC Xiangyun County Committee Vividly Studies and Applies Chairman Mao's Works to Find a Way to Change the Face of "Poor Prefecture"
    Before liberation, Xiangyun County was one of the "Four Poorest Prefectures" in Yunnan. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, water conservancy projects have been built every year, production has developed, and people's lives have improved. However, the face of poverty has not changed quickly. What is the reason for this?
          The Key Lies in the Revolutionization of the County Committee Leadership
    In the second half of last year, members of the County Party Committee Standing Committee, carrying this question, collectively studied "On Contradiction" and repeatedly discussed what the main contradiction in changing the face of Xiangyun was. Everyone used Mao Zedong Thought to examine themselves and deeply realized that the key lies in the mental state of the county committee. In the past, county committee members always felt that the drought was severe, the county was large, the place was poor, and it was difficult to get things done. If things were not handled well, mistakes would be made. Therefore, they dared not think, dared not act, and lacked the grand ideals and ambitions to fundamentally change the face of Xiangyun.
    In order to change the mental state of the county committee, the county committee adopted the method of open-door revolution, widely listened to the opinions of cadres and the broad masses, and conducted rectification and study. They studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "Get Organized!," "Methods of Work of Party Committees," and "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" again with questions in mind, and further realized that only when the county committee's ideology is revolutionized and it serves the people with a completely and thoroughly spirit can it lead the people of the county to overcome drought and change the face of poverty.
        To Transform Xiangyun, First We Must Understand Xiangyun
    After the mental state of the county committee changed, on the basis of organizing cadres to study Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously grasping the ideological revolutionization of cadres, it considered how to change the face of Xiangyun. Chairman Mao said: "You cannot solve a problem? Then get down and investigate the present facts and its past history! When you have investigated the problem thoroughly, you will know how to solve it." Chairman Mao's instruction pointed out the direction for the county committee. The county committee realized that to transform Xiangyun, one must first understand Xiangyun. To understand Xiangyun, one can only investigate and research. Therefore, the newly arrived County Party Secretary and other members of the County Party Committee Standing Committee went deep into the grassroots to investigate and research, listening to the opinions of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.
    In the past, the county committee's understanding of the drought problem was always based on drought and water. Therefore, for more than ten years, the county has put its main efforts into water conservancy construction. By 1964, the total storage capacity of reservoirs and ponds built throughout the county reached 105 million cubic meters, more than six times that of the early days of liberation. However, because only water conservancy was built and no attention was paid to cultivating water sources, the result was that there was not enough water to store, and the annual utilization rate of the reservoir capacity was only 60% to 70%. Through the investigation of historical conditions and the status quo, the county committee saw that the drought in Xiangyun was mainly due to two reasons. One aspect is related to the terrain: the terrain is high, it is a high mountain basin, it is difficult to draw water from outside into the county, and there are not many natural water sources in the county; the other aspect is closely related to the forest, because afforestation and forest protection are not good, soil erosion is serious, and water sources are reduced. Poor afforestation and forest protection not only affect irrigation, but also reduce fertilizer sources and pastures, and some areas suffer from floods during the rainy season. The county committee also investigated vivid examples of how good afforestation and forest protection promoted the improvement of water conservancy conditions. These positive and negative examples made the county committee see the internal connection between water and forest, and understand that "poverty lies in water," and "the root lies in forest."
    Investigation and research also made the Xiangyun County Committee see that in the past, there was also one-sidedness and a lack of seeking truth from facts in the question of whether to plant more paddy fields or more dry land. For a long time, the county committee did not fully study the county's conditions and blindly engaged in converting dry land to paddy fields. After this investigation, the county committee realized that this was not in line with the county's current water conservancy situation. Generally, about 180,000 mu of rice are planted in the county every year, but from the perspective of water storage conditions, only 80,000 to 90,000 mu can guarantee irrigation, and about 90,000 mu (about half) of the area will dry up after planting. Among these 180,000 mu of paddy fields, 50,000 to 60,000 mu are "thunder-sounding fields," which can only be planted after the rain comes. Not only is the yield low because it cannot catch up with the season, but also because it matures late, it can only be planted for one season. How to solve this problem? In the investigation, the county committee saw that the masses in some places had already created successful experiences, that is, proceeding from reality, changing "thunder-sounding fields" to dry land and planting dry land crops, planting two seasons a year. In general, this can increase production by 50% to 100% compared to planting rice. The county committee considered that if 50,000 mu of "thunder-sounding fields" were converted into dry land throughout the county, these fields could greatly increase production on the one hand, and the water force could be concentrated to ensure high yields in water-retaining fields on the other hand.
            Dialectically Handle Various Relationships
    After the county committee investigated and researched and understood the situation in Xiangyun, it continued to study Chairman Mao's philosophical essays with the question of how to build a new socialist Xiangyun. When formulating its work requirements and goals, they used materialist dialectics to deal with the relationships between long-term and current, major and minor, general and individual, and so on.
    The first is to correctly handle the relationship between long-term and current. The county committee believes that, in the long run, converting dry land to paddy fields should be the goal of struggle. However, some places do not yet have the conditions at present. If we do it blindly, we will violate objective laws and fail to produce well. Therefore, converting "thunder-sounding fields" to dry land at present seems to be a retreat on the surface, but in fact, it is for better progress. Ten years later, when the water source is abundant, and the funds, grain, and materials for building water conservancy are abundant, converting dry land to paddy fields can be done more, faster, and better. In addition, from the perspective of fertilizer issues, there is currently a contradiction between closing hillsides for afforestation and cutting thatch to accumulate fertilizer. The county committee considers that to effectively solve the fertilizer problem, afforestation and forest protection are key. Only when the mountains and forests are lush can there be a broad source of fertilizer. Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement closing hillsides for afforestation. However, at the same time, if the current fertilizer needs cannot be guaranteed, the mountains cannot be closed, and the forests cannot be cultivated. Therefore, it also advocates closing hillsides in a planned way, while taking the method of planting green manure on a large scale to overcome the contradiction between closing hillsides for afforestation and fertilizer for production, and using the method of cultivating eucalyptus trees in the dam area to overcome the contradiction between closing hillsides for afforestation and the people's use of timber and firewood.
    In the relationship between major and minor, general and individual, the county committee also strives to solve it dialectically in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. For example, from the perspective of the entire county, converting "thunder-sounding fields" to dry land is the main and general, while in some dam areas and mountainous areas where water conservancy conditions permit, the existing water conservancy conditions and natural water sources can be used to implement the conversion of dry land to paddy fields. This is consistent with the long-term goal of converting dry land to paddy fields throughout the county, and it is also permitted by current conditions, and it can accumulate experience for large-scale conversion of dry land to paddy fields in the future.
        Be Sure to Grasp Class Struggle as the Key Link
    After the Xiangyun County Committee used Mao Zedong Thought to study and analyze the problems, it initially formed the work requirements and goals of Xiangyun County. That is: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rely on our own efforts, work hard, and under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link, diversified management, and comprehensive development, under the guidance of the provincial party committee's policy of cadres at all levels bringing a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a hoe to the front line of production, starting from the characteristics of Xiangyun's bare mountains, drought, and barren soil, we should focus on forestry and fertilizer in a planned and step-by-step manner, vigorously carry out four reforms (converting "thunder-sounding fields" to dry land, converting low-yield to high-yield, converting slopes to terraces, converting extensive cultivation to intensive cultivation), and do everything possible to tap the potential of water, and strive to build a new socialist Xiangyun with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The county committee has also established five advanced models throughout the county that highlight politics and change the face of "bare mountains, drought, barren soil, and poor people" based on reality. This has aroused a strong response among the masses. The cadres and masses of the county have already taken action and are working hard to realize this work requirement and goal in a planned and step-by-step manner. The Xiangyun County Committee reviewed this period of work and believed that the process of understanding and exploring ways to change the face of Xiangyun is actually a process of highlighting politics and vividly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and a process of arming ourselves and the broad masses of cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, it believes that to implement the work requirements and goals, it is by no means just a matter of production, business, and technology. We must start from politics, we must grasp class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, we must link the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world, and we must establish proletarian ideology and carry forward the style of hard struggle.

### “调查就是解决问题”——中共祥云县委活学活用毛主席著作找到了改变“穷洲”面貌的办法

    “调查就是解决问题”
    ——中共祥云县委活学活用毛主席著作找到了改变“穷洲”面貌的办法
    祥云县解放前是云南的“四大穷洲”之一，解放以来，在党的领导下，年年兴修水利，生产有了发展，人民生活有了提高。但是，贫困面貌改变不快。这是什么原因？
          关键在于县委领导革命化
    去年下半年，县委常委带着这个问题，集体学习《矛盾论》，多次讨论改变祥云面貌的主要矛盾是什么？大家用毛泽东思想对照检查，深刻地认识到：关键在于县委的精神状态。过去，县委成员总觉得干旱重，县又大，地方又穷，难办事，搞不好，还要犯错误，因此，不敢想，不敢干，缺乏从根本上改变祥云面貌的远大理想和雄心壮志。
    为了改变县委的精神状态，县委采用开门革命的办法，广泛听取各方面干部和广大群众的意见，进行了整风学习。他们带着问题再次学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《放下包袱，开动机器》、《党委会的工作方法》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》等文章，进一步认识到只有县委思想革命化，用完全彻底的精神为人民服务，才能领导全县人民战胜干旱、改变贫困面貌。
        要改造祥云，首先要认识祥云
    县委的精神状态有了改变以后，在组织干部学习毛主席著作，大抓干部思想革命化的基础上，又考虑怎样改变祥云面貌。毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”毛主席的这一指示给县委指明了方向，县委认识到，要改造祥云，首先要认识祥云。要认识祥云，只有调查研究。于是，新来不久的县委书记和县委其他常委都深入到基层去调查研究，听取广大贫下中农的意见。
    过去县委对干旱问题的认识，一直是就旱论旱，就水议水。因此，全县十多年来把主要力量用在水利建设上。到一九六四年，全县兴建的水库塘坝库容量达到一亿零五百万立方米，比解放初期增加了六倍多。但是由于只修水利，不注意培养水源，结果没有足够的水蓄，每年库容利用率只是百分之六十到七十。通过对历史情况和现状的调查，县委看到祥云干旱主要有两方面的原因。一个方面是与地势有关：地势高，是高山盆地，从外面向县里引水困难，县内的天然水源不多；另一方面是与森林有密切的关系，由于造林护林不好，水土流失严重，水源减少。造林和护林不好，不仅影响灌溉，还使得肥源、牧场减少，部分地区在多雨季节遭到洪灾。县委也调查了造林护林搞得好，促进了水利条件改善的生动例子。这些正面和反面的例子使县委看到了水和林的内在联系，懂得了“穷在水上”，而“根在林上”。
    调查研究，也使祥云县委看到，过去在多种水田还是多种旱地的问题上，也是有片面性的，是不够实事求是的。长期以来，县委没有充分研究本县的条件，一味搞旱地改水田。经过这次调查，县委认识到，这是与本县现在的水利状况不相适应的。全县一般每年栽插水稻十八万亩左右，而从蓄水条件看，只有八九万亩可以保证灌溉，有九万来亩（约为一半）的面积栽后就干水。这十八万亩水田中，有五六万亩是雷响田，等到雨水来后才能栽秧，不仅因赶不上节令产量不高，而且由于成熟迟，只能种一季。这个问题，怎么解决？在调查中，县委看到有一些地方的群众已经创造了成功的经验，这就是从实际出发，雷响田改旱地，种旱地作物，一年种两季。这样做，一般可以比种水稻增产百分之五十到一倍以上。县委考虑，全县如果改五万亩雷响田为旱地，一则这些田地可以大大增产，二则可以集中水力保证保水田高产再高产。
            辩证地处理各种关系
    县委经过调查研究，认识了祥云的情况以后，又带着怎样建设社会主义新祥云的问题，继续学习毛主席的几篇哲学论文。他们在制定自己的工作要求和奋斗目标时，运用唯物辩证法去处理长远和目前、主要和次要、一般和个别等等的关系。
    首先是正确处理长远和目前的关系。县委认为，从长远看，应该说改旱地为水田是奋斗目标。但是，目前一些地方条件还不具备，如果硬干，就会违反客观规律，搞不好生产。所以，目前把雷响田改成旱地，表面看来是退，实则是为了更好地进。十年后，水源充足了，修水利的资金、粮食、材料雄厚了，旱地改水田就可以搞得更多更快更好。另外，从肥料问题看，目前封山育林与割茅草积肥也存在矛盾。县委考虑，要有效地解决肥料问题，造林护林是一个关键，只有山林繁茂了，才有广阔的肥源，所以坚决实行封山育林是必要的。但在这同时，如果不能保证当前施肥需要，山是封不住的，林是育不好的。所以，又主张有计划地封山，同时采取大种绿肥的办法来克服封山育林同生产用肥的矛盾，用在坝区培植桉树的办法，来克服封山育林同群众用材烧柴的矛盾。
    在主要和次要、一般和个别的关系上，县委也按照毛主席的教导，力求辩证地解决。比如从全县看，改雷响田为旱地是主要的，普遍性的，而在目前水利条件所允许的一些坝区和山区，就可以利用现有水利条件和自然水源来实行旱地改水田。这与全县旱（地）改水（田）的长远奋斗目标是一致的也是目前条件所允许的，而且可为将来大面积旱改水积累经验。
        一定要抓住阶级斗争这个纲
    祥云县委用毛泽东思想研究分析问题，结果，就初步形成了祥云县的工作要求和奋斗目标。这就是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，在以粮为纲、多种经营、全面发展的方针指导下，在省委关于各级干部带上一部《毛泽东选集》、一把锄头到生产第一线的工作方针的指导下，从祥云山光、干旱、土瘦的特点出发，应该有计划、有步骤地狠抓林业、肥料，大搞四改（雷响田改旱地，低产改高产，坡地改梯地，粗放耕作改精耕细作），千方百计挖掘水的潜力，为多快好省地建设社会主义新祥云而奋斗。县委还在全县树立了五个突出政治、从实际出发改变“山光、干旱、土瘦、人穷”面貌的先进样板。这样，在群众中引起了强烈的反映。全县干部群众已经行动起来，正为有计划、有步骤地实现这个工作要求和奋斗目标而努力。祥云县委回顾了这一段工作，认为：认识和摸索改变祥云面貌的途径的过程，实际是一个突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的过程，用毛泽东思想武装自己和广大干部群众的过程。同时认为，要把工作要求和奋斗目标贯彻下去，决不只是生产、业务、技术的问题，一定要从政治抓起，一定要抓住阶级斗争和两条道路斗争这个纲，一定要把改造人的主观世界和改造客观世界联系起来，一定要树立无产阶级思想，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风。　　　　　　　（据新华社昆明十二日电）
