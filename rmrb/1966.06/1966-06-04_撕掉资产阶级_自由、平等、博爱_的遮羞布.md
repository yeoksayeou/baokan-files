	Currently, our country is facing a great wave of proletarian cultural revolution. This wave has powerfully struck at the decaying ideological and cultural strongholds where remnants of the bourgeoisie and feudalism still exist. Broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are launching a fierce counterattack against the anti-party and anti-socialist black line of the bourgeoisie. This is a serious, sharp, and complex political struggle, a life-and-death class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. This struggle is not a small matter; it is a matter of life and death for our party and our country, a matter of the future of our party and our country, and a matter of the future appearance of our party and our country. It is also a matter of the world revolution.

	Chairman Mao, based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, has comprehensively and systematically analyzed the classes and class struggles in socialist society. He has creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: In socialist society, after the completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class contradictions still exist, and class struggle has not been extinguished. Throughout the entire socialist stage, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the two classes, and between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. To ensure socialist construction and prevent capitalist restoration, we must carry the socialist revolution to the end on the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts. Chairman Mao's theory on classes and class struggle in socialist society, his theory on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and his theory that not only must the socialist revolution be carried out in the ownership of the means of production but also in the ideological realm, are the correct lines and guiding principles that we must follow in this great proletarian cultural revolution.

	A small handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated our party are deliberately concealing the class nature of this struggle. They turn a serious political struggle into what they call a "purely academic problem" or a "disagreement discussion." They have raised the black flag of bourgeois "liberty, equality, fraternity" to oppose the proletarian cultural revolution line of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao. They frantically shout that various different opinions (including anti-Marxist-Leninist things) should be fully expressed, that in the face of truth, everyone is equal, that one should not be dogmatic and oppressive like a scholar, and that the struggle against anti-party and anti-socialist ghosts and snakes should be "cautious" and "careful," and that one should not "hold on to them." Their evil intentions are to deceive the masses, muddy the waters, confuse class lines, and shift the target of struggle. They want to boost the morale of the bourgeois rightists, suppress the morale of the proletarian leftists, protect the bourgeois rightists, and attack the proletarian leftists. They want to promote bourgeois liberalization and revisionism, attempting to create chaos in the proletarian world, so that when the time comes, they can seize the power of the proletariat and achieve capitalist restoration.

	The "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, you bunch of guys who are experts in making mistakes. You have completely misjudged the situation. You have completely misjudged the awareness and strength of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. You have also completely misjudged the leadership of the party and the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. You mistakenly think that you can use the tattered flag of "liberty, equality, fraternity" to cover up your attacks on the party and socialism. You mistakenly think that you can use the tattered flag of "liberty, equality, fraternity" as a shield to cover your retreat. You mistakenly think that we will abandon the dictatorship of the proletariat and discuss liberty, equality, and fraternity with you bunch of ghosts and snakes, allowing you to seize our power. That is absolutely impossible. You bunch of guys, you are humans on the surface but ghosts in the dark. You wolves do not think that by wearing sheep's skin, you can deceive anyone. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a firm stand, a clear banner, and sharp eyes. We have already exposed your counter-revolutionary black curtain and grabbed your claws. We will definitely strip off your disguises layer by layer and expose your ugly faces nakedly in broad daylight.

	The "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, you keep talking about "liberty," emphasizing so-called "letting go." In reality, you are using sleight of hand to completely distort the party's policy of letting go and erase the class content of letting go. Your "letting go" is to meet the needs of your own class, to promote bourgeois liberalization, to oppose the leadership of the party, to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

	"The party's policy is to 'let go,' right?" This is a pretext used by those bourgeois "authorities." Yes, we firmly adhere to the policy of letting go. Chairman Mao said: "We adopt the policy of letting go because it is a policy that is beneficial to the consolidation of our country and the development of culture." He also said: "Letting go is to let everyone speak their minds, so that people dare to speak, dare to criticize, and dare to debate." When talking about this issue, Chairman Mao specially pointed out: "We still have to carry out a long-term struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. Not understanding this situation and giving up ideological struggle is wrong. All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and snakes, must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." Our letting go is the proletariat's firm class policy, which has the political standard of the proletariat. Your so-called "letting go" is to allow the bourgeoisie to let go but not the proletariat. It is to allow you, the bourgeois "authorities," "experts," and "scholars," to spread poison but not to allow the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals to counterattack. In a word, you are using "letting go" as a cover to carry out anti-party and anti-socialist actions.

	Isn't this the case? For many years, you, the bourgeois "authorities," have let ghosts and snakes out of the bag, in collusion with international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to sing the anti-China chorus, and have been spreading poison without stopping for a single day. Your poisonous weeds have filled our newspapers, radio, publications, books, textbooks, speeches, literary works, films, dramas, folk arts, fine arts, music, and dance, etc., without promoting the leadership of the proletariat and without needing anyone's approval. However, when we launch a counterattack on the ideological and cultural front, what attitude do you take towards the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the proletarian leftists? All the things that criticize poisonous weeds, you hold them back, and some of them are suppressed for several years. You have a rule on the left and a taboo on the right, pretending and deceiving, scaring the workers, peasants, and soldiers. You praise the so-called academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, hate and suppress the new forces representing the proletariat, and do not allow the workers, peasants, and soldiers to overthrow the bourgeois "authorities" and make a revolution.

	It can be seen that the "liberty" you want is not something else. You want the liberty to open a "Three Families Village" black inn. You want the liberty to spread "Yanshan Black Language." You want the liberty to perform black plays and black films such as "Xie Yaohuan," "Li Huimang," "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and "The Enemy at the Gate." You want the liberty to plead for the right-wing opportunists and encourage them to come back. You want the liberty to pour cold water and beat up the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who are studying Chairman Mao's works earnestly. You want the liberty to spread the decadent and declining ideology of the landlord bourgeoisie and revisionist ideology, paving the way for capitalist restoration. The "liberty" you want is the liberty to attack the party and socialism, the liberty to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the liberty to attack Mao Zedong Thought. In a word, it is the liberty of counter-revolution.

	Chairman Mao has said: "In the world, there is only concrete liberty and concrete democracy, not abstract liberty and abstract democracy. In a class struggle society, if there is the liberty of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, then there is no liberty of the laboring people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, then there is no democracy for the proletariat and the laboring people." Our socialist system is that we do not allow all counter-revolutionaries to have freedom of speech, but only allow people within the people to have this freedom. If we allow you to have the freedom to be anti-party and anti-socialist, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.

	The "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, you keep talking about "equality," saying that "in the face of truth, everyone is equal." This is a thoroughly bourgeois slogan, a extremely reactionary slogan to protect the bourgeoisie, oppose the proletariat, oppose Marxism-Leninism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

	Do you really advocate equality? No, it is not like that at all. When you attack the proletariat, you are so arrogant and domineering. You treat the things of the bourgeois "experts" and "scholars" as gods and treasures, giving them special coverage, special lectures, special performances, and special praise. You treat the things of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, even those good articles that earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, as worthless, publicly slandering them as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "typical practicalism," and beating them into the cold palace. Is this equality? You have spread so much poison, and as soon as we counterattack, you shout that "in the face of truth, everyone is equal." You even put a "scholar" hat on the proletarian leftists, slandering our counterattack as "dogmatic" and "oppressive." We want to ask, what is a "scholar"? Who is a "scholar"? Does the proletariat not want dictatorship and suppress the bourgeoisie? Does the proletariat's academia not want to suppress and eliminate the bourgeoisie's academia? What you are doing is actually to resist criticism, support the true bourgeois scholars, and strike the proletarian leftists. Is this also equality?

	Do you really advocate truth? No. You are using the cover of "truth" to plot. You use the tactic of digging out the heart, fundamentally removing the class nature of truth. Don't you know that in a class society, there is only class truth, and there is no abstract, super-class truth? What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. Truth and fallacy, flowers and weeds, different classes have always had different views. The "flowers" you praise are precisely the "weeds" we want to uproot. The "truth" you insist on is precisely the bourgeois fallacy we want to oppose. Truth is objective. There is only one truth, and who discovers the truth does not depend on subjective exaggeration but on objective practice. Only the revolutionary practice of millions of people is the criterion for testing truth. Only the most advanced and revolutionary proletariat can understand the objective laws of social development and grasp the truth. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, a powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat and the revolutionary people of the world, and the great truth of this great era. Mao Zedong Thought is the truth that conforms to the laws of development of socialist society, the truth that conforms to the laws of development of nature, and the truth that conforms to the needs of the proletarian revolution. We regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive and the highest leadership, which is to love truth, support truth, and insist on truth. When you shout that "in the face of truth, everyone is equal," in essence, you want to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and use reactionary bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology to replace the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is your great plot!

	Chairman Mao teaches us that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between Marxist truth and the fallacies of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, is not about whether the east wind prevails over the west wind or the west wind prevails over the east wind, but about whether there can be any equality. The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship in the superstructure, including various cultural fields, the proletariat's continued elimination of the representatives of the bourgeoisie who sneak into the Communist Party and wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, etc., in these fundamental issues, can there be any equality? For decades, the old social democrats and modern revisionists for more than a decade have never allowed the proletariat to have any equality with the bourgeoisie. They fundamentally deny that the history of mankind for thousands of years is a history of class struggle, fundamentally deny the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, fundamentally deny the revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, they are loyal dogs of the bourgeoisie and imperialism, together with the bourgeoisie and imperialism, insisting on the ideological system of the bourgeoisie oppressing and exploiting the proletariat and the capitalist social system, opposing the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist social system. They are a group of anti-communist, anti-people counter-revolutionaries. Their struggle with us is a life-and-death struggle, and there is no talk of any equality. Therefore, our struggle with them can only be a life-and-death struggle. Our relationship with them is absolutely not any equality, but a relationship of one class oppressing another class, that is, the relationship of the dictatorship or dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, and it cannot be any other relationship, such as the so-called equality relationship, the peaceful coexistence relationship between the exploited class and the exploiting class, the relationship of benevolence and righteousness, etc.

	On the black flag that you, the bunch of ghosts and snakes of the bourgeoisie, wave in public, there is also the word "fraternity." What "fraternity" do you advocate? You are full of love for the bourgeoisie and full of hatred for the proletariat. This is your bourgeois view of fraternity.

	Let us see what these so-called "fraternity" philanthropists really love! When the anti-party and anti-socialist gangsters attack the party ferociously, trying to overthrow the leadership of the party, and want to give the party a "blow to the head" and "blood splashing," you, the backstage bosses, open the green light, beat the war drums, summon the wind and rain, and push the waves, forgetting yourselves, clapping and cheering, thinking that your good days have come. But the good times do not last long, and your anti-party and anti-socialist black curtain is quickly exposed. When you lose your helmets and armor and flee in disarray, you hurriedly raise the tattered flag of "fraternity," putting on a false face of impartiality and justice, shouting that for those with "reactionary academic views," you should allow them to "retain their opinions," not to "not allow revolution," not to "hold on to them," etc. It is true that birds of a feather flock together. You are so considerate and protective of your anti-party and anti-socialist gangsters! But you regard the firm proletarian leftists as thorns in your eyes and thorns in your flesh, wanting to "rectify" their "wind," to "clean up" them, and wanting to eat them up. Your bourgeois stance is so firm! Your love and hatred are so clear!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, and there is no hatred without reason." "We do not apply benevolent politics to the reactionary actions of the reactionaries and reactionary classes. We only apply benevolent politics to the people within the people, and not to the reactionary actions of the reactionaries and reactionary classes outside the people." You, the "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, you bunch of guys, are the same as imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, the same as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists at home. We are irreconcilable with you, and our struggle with you is irreconcilable. You have never "loved" us, and we will never love you. You are so vicious and hateful towards our great proletarian party and the people, using all means to destroy us, wanting to put us to death. Can we still talk about "love" to you? In dealing with the enemies of the revolution, we will not practice benevolence. Your benevolence is cruelty to the proletariat, cruelty to millions of laboring people. We will not take the wolf as a sheep, take arsenic as candy. We will not be fooled by you, the smiling tigers. We must use your own methods to fight back, and we must give you a devastating blow, completely disgrace you, completely defeat you, completely overthrow you, and sweep away all the "harmful insects" clean!

	"Liberty, equality, fraternity" is the reactionary and decadent worldview of the bourgeoisie. This slogan, from the eighteenth century when the French bourgeoisie proposed it to now, has been two centuries. Although it had progressive significance when the French bourgeoisie led the revolution, it was a hypocritical slogan used by the bourgeoisie to maintain their class interests. When the bourgeoisie carried out the democratic revolution, they used this slogan to deceive the laboring people, seize power from the feudal landlord class, and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. After the bourgeoisie seized power, they continued to use this slogan to numb the laboring people, to cover up their bloody rule, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The so-called liberty of the bourgeoisie is only to demand the liberty to exploit hired labor and plunder colonies; on the other hand, it is that the laborers only have the liberty to be exploited, and the colonial peoples only have the liberty to be plundered. The so-called equality of the bourgeoisie is only to demand equality in exploiting hired labor; for the laboring people, it is only equal in being exploited. The so-called fraternity of the bourgeoisie is only to want more and more people to be exploited and enslaved by them; for the exploited and oppressed people, it is to demand that they be grateful to the bourgeoisie for their exploitation. Marx and Engels said: The exploiters of labor power, as long as there is a muscle, a vein, and a drop of blood to be squeezed, will never let go. This is the reactionary essence of the bourgeoisie's "liberty, equality, fraternity" slogan.

	After the bourgeois power is overthrown by the proletarian revolution, they are never willing to admit their defeat and always try every means to carry out various plots and sabotage activities. They also use their agents who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and use the reactionary slogan of "liberty, equality, fraternity" to deceive and numb the laboring people, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and dream of restoring the "paradise" they have lost. The old social democrats, in order to oppose the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, have raised the black flag of "liberty, equality, fraternity." The modern revisionists of Khrushchev, in order to achieve the retrogression of socialism to capitalism, in order to oppose and sabotage the world people's revolution, also raised this reactionary black flag and included it in the notorious program of the CPSU. In 1956, the Petofi Club in Hungary also used this black flag to incite the masses and carry out counter-revolutionary rebellion. In our country, in 1957, the bourgeois rightists once raised this black flag and frantically opposed the party and socialism. At the Lushan Conference, those right-wing opportunists who were dismissed from office also vigorously promoted this reactionary slogan to oppose the Party Central Committee, oppose the correct line of the party, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Now, you, the "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, have picked up this piece of trash from the historical garbage dump, changed its appearance, and disguised it as your anti-party and anti-socialist banner, as your action program to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and as your magic weapon to obstruct and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. You have inherited the legacy of the ancient and modern, domestic and foreign bourgeoisie and revisionism, formed cliques, deceived and cheated, and competed with the proletariat, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and achieve capitalist restoration. You are wasting your efforts and dreaming in broad daylight! Your fate will not be more beautiful than that of your ancestors and brothers!

	Our socialist society is still based on class antagonism. The landlord bourgeoisie has been overthrown, but it has not been completely eliminated. We have confiscated the material of the exploiting class, but we cannot confiscate their reactionary thoughts. They are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. They always want to restore their power. Although they occupy a very small proportion of the population, their resistance is much greater than their population proportion. The spontaneous forces of the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie are constantly producing new bourgeois elements. The working class is also growing and expanding, and some complex elements have been mixed in. There are also some people in the party and state organs who have degenerated and changed quality. In addition, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are always trying every means to mess with us. These have made our country face the danger of capitalist restoration. We must not ignore this danger. We must be highly vigilant against foreign enemies and must not be complacent about domestic enemies. We must pay attention to the enemies with guns, but we must not underestimate the enemies without guns. Wolves in sheep's clothing are more dangerous than ordinary wolves, more dangerous than a large group of wolves. Enemies waving the red flag are more dangerous than enemies waving the white flag. Sugar-coated bullets can kill people. Smiling tigers can eat people. We must not, in the midst of a thousand things and a thousand affairs, neglect politics and forget class struggle. Forgetting politics and class struggle is forgetting the fundamental viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. That is being careless and ignorant. We must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to highlight politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The essence of Marxism is critical and revolutionary. Its basic point is to criticize, to struggle, and to revolutionize. We must not use reformist methods to deal with bourgeois things and revisionist things, but must use thorough revolutionary methods. In dealing with the enemies of the revolution, we must rely on struggle, not persuasion. You do not struggle with it, and it will struggle with you. You do not beat it, and it will beat you. Without destruction, there is no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction comes first, and construction follows. The "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, you say we are "demolition experts" and "sticks." You are right. We are the "demolition experts" of the proletariat, blowing up all the black villages and black inns of anti-party and anti-socialism. We are the "golden sticks" of the proletariat, beating all the ghosts and snakes into a mess. Whoever is anti-party and anti-socialist, whoever opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow them. No matter what number of "authority" they are, no matter how high their position is, we will condemn them nationwide and kill them with the whole party.

	Currently, we are facing a great situation. The world is in a great situation, and China is in a great situation. Our party is a party that has been led by Chairman Mao for decades of revolution, a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a party that is closely connected with the masses, a party with rich revolutionary experience and glorious revolutionary traditions, a party that has withstood various storms in the long-term revolutionary struggle, a glorious, great, and correct party. Any ghosts and snakes, any plotters and conspirators, who want to seize our fortress from within and repeat the disgraceful drama of Khrushchev's usurpation of the party, the army, and the government in China, will definitely be beaten to a pulp, will definitely be disgraced, and will definitely end in complete failure. We will use the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great cause of communism to arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the laboring people of our country, open our eyes to the future, and advance firmly. The workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals must closely unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the ferocious attacks of the bourgeois black gang, resolutely pull out the black flag of bourgeois "liberty, equality, fraternity," sweep away all the ghosts and snakes, and carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

### 撕掉资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”的遮羞布

    撕掉资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”的遮羞布
    当前，我国正面临着一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮。这个高潮，有力地冲击着资产阶级和封建残余还保存的一切腐朽的思想阵地和文化阵地。广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命的知识分子，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向资产阶级反党反社会主义的黑线，展开了猛烈的反击。这是一场严重的、尖锐的、复杂的政治斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级之争，社会主义同资本主义之争，革命同反革命之争，马克思列宁主义同修正主义之争，是一场你死我活的阶级搏斗。这个斗争绝不是一件小事，而是关系到我们党和国家的命运，关系到我们党和国家的前途，关系到我们党和国家将来面貌的头等大事，也是关系到世界革命的头等大事。
    毛主席根据马克思列宁主义的基本原理和无产阶级专政的历史经验，全面地、系统地分析了社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。毛主席教导我们：在社会主义社会里，在完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，阶级矛盾仍然存在，阶级斗争并没有熄灭。在整个社会主义阶段，贯穿着无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。为了保证社会主义建设和防止资本主义复辟，必须在政治战线、经济战线、思想和文化战线上，把社会主义革命进行到底。毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的理论，关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论，关于不仅要进行所有制的社会主义革命，而且要进行意识形态领域里的社会主义革命的理论，正是我们在这场伟大的社会主义文化大革命中必须遵循的正确路线和指导方针。
    混进我们党内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，别有用心地掩盖这场斗争的阶级实质，把严重的政治斗争，硬说成是什么“纯学术的问题”，是什么“不同意见的讨论”，打出了一面资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”的黑旗，同以毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级文化革命路线相对抗。他们疯狂地叫嚷什么要“让各种不同意见（包括反马克思列宁主义的东西）都充分地放出来”，叫嚷什么“在真理面前人人平等”，“不要象学阀一样武断和以势压人”，叫嚷什么对那些反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神的斗争要“谨慎”，要“慎重”，不要“揪住不放”等等，等等。他们的险恶用心就是要欺骗群众，把水搅浑，混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争目标。就是要长资产阶级右派的志气，灭无产阶级左派的威风，包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级左派。就是要搞资产阶级自由化，搞修正主义那一套，妄图把无产阶级的天下搞乱，以便时机一到，夺取无产阶级的政权，实现资本主义复辟。
    资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，你们这些家伙是犯错误的专家。你们对形势的估计完全错了。你们对工农兵的觉悟和力量的估计完全错了。你们对党的领导和无产阶级专政的威力的估计也完全错了。你们妄想用“自由、平等、博爱”的破旗，来掩护你们向党向社会主义进攻，是办不到的。你们妄想用“自由、平等、博爱”的破旗，作为保护伞，来掩护你们退却，也是办不到的。你们妄想要我们放弃无产阶级专政，同你们这一伙牛鬼蛇神讲自由，讲平等，讲博爱，让你们来专我们的政，更是绝对办不到的。你们这些家伙，表面是人，暗中是鬼。你们这些狼不要以为一披上羊皮，就可以迷惑什么人。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，眼睛雪亮。我们已经把你们的反革命黑幕揭开了，把你们的魔爪抓住了。我们一定要把你们的伪装层层剥光，把你们的丑恶嘴脸赤裸裸地暴露在光天化日之下。
    资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，你们口口声声要“自由”，强调所谓“放”，实际上是用偷天换日的手法，根本歪曲党的放的方针，抹煞放的阶级内容。你们的“放”，是适应你们本阶级的需要，搞资产阶级的自由化，是反对党的领导，反对无产阶级专政，反对毛泽东思想的。
    “党的方针不是要‘放’吗？”这是那些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们打出的一个幌子。是的，我们坚定不移的采取放的方针。毛主席说：“我们采取放的方针，因为这是有利于我们国家巩固和文化发展的方针。”又说：“放，就是放手让大家讲意见，使人们敢于说话，敢于批评，敢于争论”。毛主席在讲到这个问题的时候，还特别指出：“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们的放，是无产阶级坚定的阶级政策，是有无产阶级的政治标准的。你们的所谓“放”，是只许资产阶级放，不许无产阶级放，只许你们这些资产阶级“权威”、“专家”、“学者”放毒，不许广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子进行反击。一句话，你们是借“放”之名，行反党反社会主义之实。
    事实不正是这样吗？多年来，你们这些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，放手让牛鬼蛇神出笼，配合国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华大合唱，一直在大肆放毒，一天也没有停止过。你们的毒草，塞满了我们的报纸、广播、刊物、书籍、教科书、讲演、文艺作品、电影、戏剧、曲艺、美术、音乐、舞蹈等等，从不提倡要受无产阶级的领导，从来也不要什么人批准。可是，当我们在思想文化战线上展开反击战的时候，你们对工农兵群众，对无产阶级左派，采取的又是什么态度呢？凡是批判毒草的东西，你们都扣下来，有的一压好几年。你们左一条清规，右一条戒律，装腔作势，故弄玄虚，吓唬工农兵。你们吹捧资产阶级的所谓学术“权威”，仇视和压制代表无产阶级的、战斗的新生力量，不准工农兵起来打倒资产阶级“权威”，不准工农兵起来闹革命。
    可见，你们所要的“自由”，不是别的，你们要的是开设“三家村”黑店的自由。是散布“燕山黑话”的自由。是大演《谢瑶环》、《李慧娘》、《海瑞罢官》、《兵临城下》等黑戏黑电影的自由。是为右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，鼓励他们卷土重来的自由。是对广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作泼冷水、打棍子的自由。是大肆宣扬腐朽没落的地主资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的自由。你们要的“自由”，就是向党向社会主义进攻的自由，向无产阶级专政进攻的自由，向毛泽东思想进攻的自由。一句话，就是要反革命的自由。
    毛主席说过：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”我们的社会主义制度，就是不许一切反革命分子有言论自由，而只许人民内部有这种自由。你们要反对党的领导，反对社会主义，我们就决不能给你们这种自由。如果允许你们有反党的自由，反社会主义的自由，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。
  资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，你们口口声声要“平等”，说什么“在真理面前人人平等”。这是一个地地道道的资产阶级的口号，是一个保护资产阶级，反对无产阶级，反对马克思列宁主义，反对毛泽东思想的极其反动的口号。
    你们果真是讲平等吗？不，完全不是这样。当你们向无产阶级进攻的时候，你们是何等猖狂，何等霸道。你们对那些资产阶级“专家”、“学者”的东西，奉若神明，视为至宝，大登特登，大讲特讲，大演特演，大捧特捧。你们对工农兵的东西，甚至象那些活学活用毛主席著作的好文章，却看得一钱不值，公然污蔑为“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的典型，一棒子打入冷宫。这难道算是平等吗？你们放了那么多毒，我们刚一反击，你们又叫嚷什么“在真理面前人人平等”。你们竟然给无产阶级左派戴上一顶“学阀”的帽子，污蔑我们的反击是什么“武断”，什么“以势压人”。我们要问，究竟什么是“学阀”？谁是“学阀”？难道无产阶级不要专政，不要压倒资产阶级？难道无产阶级的学术不要压倒和消灭资产阶级的学术？你们这样做，实际上是要负隅顽抗，拒绝批判，打击无产阶级左派，支持真正的资产阶级的学阀。这难道也算是平等吗？
    你们果真是讲真理吗？不。你们是在打着“真理”的幌子搞阴谋。你们采取挖心战术，从根本上抽掉了真理的阶级性。难道你们不知道，在有阶级的社会里，只有阶级的真理，绝没有抽象的超阶级的真理吗？什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。真理和谬论，香花和毒草，不同的阶级从来就有不同的看法。你们所吹捧的“香花”，正是我们所要铲除的毒草。你们所坚持的“真理”，正是我们所要反对的资产阶级谬论。真理是客观的。真理只有一个，而究竟谁发现了真理，不依靠主观的夸张，而依靠客观的实践。只有千百万人民的革命实践，才是检验真理的尺度。只有最先进、最革命的无产阶级，才能认识社会发展的客观规律，才能掌握真理。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级和世界革命人民强大的思想武器，是我们这个伟大时代的伟大真理。毛泽东思想是符合社会主义社会发展规律的真理，是符合自然界发展规律的真理，是符合无产阶级革命需要的真理。我们把毛泽东思想当作最高指示和最高领导，就是热爱真理，拥护真理，坚持真理。你们叫嚷什么“在真理面前人人平等”，说穿了，就是要反对毛泽东思想，就是要以反动的资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，代替伟大的毛泽东思想。这是你们的一个大阴谋！
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，马克思主义的真理同资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级的谬论的斗争，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，根本谈不上什么平等。无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，无产阶级对资产阶级专政，无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，无产阶级继续清除资产阶级钻在共产党内打着红旗反红旗的代表人物等等，在这些基本问题上，难道能够允许有什么平等吗？几十年以来的老的社会民主党和十几年以来的现代修正主义，从来就不允许无产阶级同资产阶级有什么平等。他们根本否认几千年的人类历史是阶级斗争史，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的革命和对资产阶级的专政。相反，他们是资产阶级、帝国主义的忠实走狗，同资产阶级、帝国主义一道，坚持资产阶级压迫、剥削无产阶级的思想体系和资本主义的社会制度，反对马克思列宁主义的思想体系和社会主义的社会制度。他们是一群反共、反人民的反革命分子，他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争，丝毫谈不到什么平等。因此，我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争，我们对他们的关系绝对不是什么平等的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行独裁或专政的关系，而不能是什么别的关系，例如所谓平等关系、被剥削阶级同剥削阶级的和平共处关系、仁义道德关系等等。
    资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，在你们这帮牛鬼蛇神招摇过市的黑旗上，还标着“博爱”的字样。你们“博”什么“爱”？你们是对资产阶级充满着爱，对无产阶级充满着恨。这就是你们资产阶级的博爱观。
    让我们看看，这些充满“博爱”精神的慈善家们，究竟“爱”的是什么吧！当反党反社会主义的黑帮向党猖狂进攻，要推翻党的领导，对我们党要恶狠狠地“当头一棒”、“狗血淋头”的时候，你们这些后台老板大开绿灯，大敲战鼓，呼风唤雨，推波助澜，得意忘形，拍手叫好，以为你们的好日子就要到来了。可是，好景不长，你们反党反社会主义的黑幕很快就被揭穿了。当你们丢盔卸甲、狼狈逃窜的时候，你们又慌慌张张地扯起什么“博爱”的破旗，摆出一副不偏不倚、貌似公正的伪善脸孔，叫嚷什么对那些“学术观点反动的人”，要容许他们“保留意见”，不要“不准革命”，不要“揪住不放”，等等。真是物以类聚，人以群分。你们对你们这一伙反党反社会主义黑帮，是多么体贴入微，爱护备至啊！可是，你们对坚定的无产阶级左派，却看成是眼中钉，肉中刺，要“整”他们的“风”，要“清理”他们，恨不得把他们一口吃掉。你们的资产阶级立场是多么坚定啊！你们的爱憎是多么分明啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为。”资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，你们这些家伙同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，同国内的地、富、反、坏、右，是一丘之貉，是一路货。我们同你们之间是势不两立的，我们同你们的斗争是不可调和的。你们从来也没有“爱”过我们，我们也永远不会爱你们。你们对我们无产阶级的伟大的党，对人民群众，是那么咬牙切齿，恨之入骨，无所不用其极，必欲置之死地而后快。难道我们对你们还能够讲什么“爱”吗？对待革命的敌人，我们决不搞温情主义。对你们的温情，就是对无产阶级的残忍，对千千万万劳动人民的残忍。我们决不能把豺狼当绵羊，把砒霜当蜜饯。我们决不上你们这些笑面虎的当。我们必须以其人之道还治其人之身，必须给你们以毁灭性的打击，把你们彻底搞臭，彻底斗垮，彻底打倒，把一切“害人虫”统统扫除干净！
      “自由、平等、博爱”，是资产阶级的反动腐朽的世界观。这个口号，从十八世纪法国资产阶级提出到现在，已经两个世纪了。它在当时法国资产阶级领导革命的时候，虽然具有反封建的进步意义。但是，它是一个资产阶级用来维护他们阶级私利的虚伪口号。当资产阶级进行民主革命的时候，他们用这个口号来欺骗劳动人民，向封建地主阶级夺取政权，建立资产阶级的专政。当资产阶级取得了政权以后，他们继续用这个口号麻痹劳动人民，来掩饰他们的血腥统治，巩固资产阶级专政。资产阶级的所谓自由，不过是要求有剥削雇佣劳动的自由，有掠夺殖民地的自由；而在另一方面来说，就是劳动者只有被剥削的自由，就是殖民地人民只有被掠夺的自由。资产阶级的所谓平等，不过是要求他们有剥削雇佣劳动的平等；而在劳动人民来说，只有在被剥削这一点上是平等的。资产阶级的所谓博爱，不过是要更多更多的人受他们的剥削，受他们的奴役；而对于被剥削被压迫的人民来说，则是要求他们向资产阶级的剥削感恩戴德。马克思恩格斯说过：劳动力的榨取者，在还有一块筋肉，一根脉管，一滴血可以榨取的限度内，是决不会放手的。这就是资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”这个口号的反动实质。
    当资产阶级政权被无产阶级革命推翻以后，他们总是不甘心自己的失败，总是千方百计地进行各种阴谋破坏活动，并且通过他们混在革命队伍中的代理人，利用“自由、平等、博爱”这个反动口号，欺骗和麻痹劳动人民，反对无产阶级专政，梦想恢复他们已经失去了的“天堂”。老社会民主党人，为了反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，扛起过“自由、平等、博爱”的黑旗。赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者，为了实现社会主义向资本主义倒退，为了反对和破坏世界人民革命，也扛起了这面反动的黑旗，并且把它载入了臭名昭著的苏共纲领。一九五六年，匈牙利的裴多菲俱乐部，也是利用这面黑旗，煽惑群众，进行反革命叛乱的。在我国，一九五七年，资产阶级右派分子曾经打起这面黑旗，疯狂地反党反社会主义。在庐山会议上被罢了官的那些右倾机会主义分子，也曾经大肆宣扬这个反动的口号，用来对抗党中央，反对党的正确路线，反对毛泽东思想。现在，你们这些资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，又从历史垃圾堆里拣起这个破烂货，改头换面，加以伪装，作为你们反党反社会主义的帅旗，作为你们同毛泽东思想相对抗的行动纲领，作为你们阻挠和破坏社会主义文化大革命的法宝。你们继承了古今中外资产阶级、修正主义的衣钵，结党营私，招摇撞骗，来和无产阶级较量，妄图搞垮无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。你们这是枉费心机，白日作梦！你们的下场决不会比你们那些老祖宗和弟兄们更美妙一些！
    我们的社会主义社会还是建立在阶级对立的基础上的。地主资产阶级被打倒了，但是没有完全消灭。我们没收了剥削阶级的物质，但是不能没收他们的反动思想。他们人还在，心不死。他们总是想复辟的。他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是他们的反抗力量比他们的人口比例大得多。城乡小资产阶级的自发势力，不断地生长新的资产阶级分子。工人队伍在增长和扩大中也掺进了一些复杂成份。党和国家机关中，也会有些人蜕化变质。加上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，总是千方百计地想整我们。这些都使得我国有产生资本主义复辟的危险。我们决不能忽视这种危险。对国外的敌人，我们要百倍警惕，对国内的敌人，我们也不能麻痹大意。我们要重视拿枪的敌人，也不要小看不拿枪的敌人。披着羊皮的狼比普通的狼厉害，比一大群狼还厉害。打红旗的敌人比打白旗的敌人更危险。糖衣炮弹会打死人。笑面虎会吃人。我们千万不要在千头万绪、日理万机的情况下，顾了业务，忘了政治。忘记了政治，忘记了阶级斗争，就是忘记了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根本观点。那就是马大哈，那就是糊涂人。我们一定要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    马克思主义的本质是批判的、革命的。它的基本点就是要批判、要斗争、要革命。对资产阶级的东西，修正主义的东西，决不能采取改良主义的方法，只能采取彻底革命的办法。对待革命的敌人，不能靠劝说，而要靠斗争。你不斗它，它就斗你。你不打它，它就打你。不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破字当头，立在其中。资产阶级的“权威”老爷们，你们说我们是“爆破手”，是“棍子”。你们说对了。我们就是要当无产阶级的“爆破手”，把一切反党反社会主义的黑村黑店炸个粉碎。我们就是要当无产阶级的“金棍子”，把一切牛鬼蛇神打个落花流水。谁要是反党反社会主义，谁要是反对无产阶级专政，谁要是反对毛泽东思想，我们就要打倒谁。不管他是哪一号的“权威”，不管他有多高的地位，都要全国共讨之，全党共诛之。
    目前，我们面临着一片大好形势。世界是大好形势，中国是大好形势。我们的党是毛主席领导下几十年革命的党，是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党，是密切联系群众的党，是有丰富的革命经验和光荣的革命传统的党，是在长期的革命斗争中经住了各种风浪考验的党，是光荣的、伟大的、正确的党。任何牛鬼蛇神，任何阴谋家和野心家，想要从内部来夺取我们的堡垒，在中国重演赫鲁晓夫篡党篡军篡政的丑剧，都一定要碰得头破血流，都一定要身败名裂，都一定要以彻底失败而告终。我们要用伟大的毛泽东思想，用伟大的共产主义正义事业，来激发我国劳动人民的革命热情，放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进。我们全国工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，要紧紧地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎资产阶级黑帮的猖狂进攻，坚决拔掉资产阶级“自由、平等、博爱”的黑旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把伟大的社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
