    Hiding Private Goods Behind the Word "But"
    Wang Linghan
    Jian Bozan has always presented himself as a Marxist historian. Because he flies the flag of Marxism, some of his articles have misled some people. His "Preliminary Opinions on Handling Several Historical Issues" is one such article. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to expose his trickery in front of the broad masses of readers, so that everyone can see what exactly he is selling under the guise of Marxism, and what kind of tricks he is playing.
    The truth is that it's not worth a penny. As everyone knows, Jian Bozan opposes others who, when discussing emperors and generals, "affirm them first, and then immediately negate them." But in this article he wrote, he is playing the same trick. He starts by saying a few words that seem somewhat Marxist, and then comes a "but" to negate it, and thus his private goods are hidden behind this "but." If you don't believe it, here are some examples as proof:
    Jian Bozan said: "Peasant wars are the highest manifestation of the contradictions in feudal society, and it must be admitted that they play a role in promoting history." This sentence is in line with the viewpoint of historical materialism. But then he negates it by saying: "But peasant wars occur at different times, with different scales, and with different durations, and therefore the breadth and depth of their impact on feudal society also vary, and the role they play is also different, and cannot be generalized."
    Jian Bozan is playing the trick of abstract affirmation and concrete negation here. On the surface, he says "cannot be generalized," seemingly still affirming peasant wars to some extent. But looking further, he attributes whether peasant wars play a role to the "concession policies" of the feudal ruling class. It turns out that, in Jian Bozan's view, it is not the revolution of the peasants that promotes history, but the concessions and favors of the ruling class. In this very passage, he makes the reactionary conclusion: peasants "do not oppose the feudal system" and "do not oppose the landlord class." I ask: since peasant wars do not oppose the feudal system, how can they be the highest manifestation of the contradictions in feudal society? How can they play a role in promoting history? Therefore, the words behind the "but" directly overturn the words before the "but"; the words before are false, and the words behind are Jian Bozan's true thoughts.
    Is Jian Bozan's evaluation of the historical role of peasant wars really Marxist theory? Let us compare it with Chairman Mao's theory, and the truth and falsehood will be immediately clear.
    Chairman Mao said: "In Chinese feudal society, only this class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and the peasant wars, are the true driving force of historical development." ("The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") This means that, regardless of when they occur, how large their scale, or how long they last, peasant wars always play a role in promoting history. Only by using the viewpoint of class struggle to explain history, and by seeing the development of class contradictions as the force driving society forward and promoting the metabolism of the old and new societies, is this the true viewpoint of historical materialism. Jian Bozan, however, believes that the role of peasant wars in promoting history should be acknowledged "not in general terms," which means that peasant wars do not necessarily promote historical progress. What kind of Marxist theory is this? It is a completely reactionary bourgeois historical idealist historical theory.
    Jian Bozan also said: "The working people, whether slaves, serfs, or peasants, all oppose oppression and exploitation." This sentence is not wrong. But then he negates it with the same despicable technique, saying: "But they do not understand that the basic reason for being exploited and oppressed is the private property system, they do not oppose the private property system, but only oppose those intolerable differences in property." Jian Bozan means that peasants do not oppose the feudal private social system, and that when peasants rise up to resist, they only want to get something from the landlords and reduce some of the differences in property. This is a vicious slander and curse against the peasant revolution from the standpoint of the landlord class!
    Chairman Mao said: "The main targets of the peasants' attacks are the local tyrants and evil gentry, the lawless landlords, as well as various patriarchal ideas and systems, the corrupt officials in the cities, and the bad habits in the countryside." ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan") This is because the purpose of the peasant revolution is to get rid of the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, and the private property system of feudal society is the system on which the landlord class relies to oppress and exploit the peasants. Peasants cannot completely get rid of the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class if they do not oppose the private property system. The class contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class is determined by the private property system of feudal society. If the peasants do not oppose the private property system, the class contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class can never be eliminated. Therefore, whether the peasants are aware of it or not, the fact that the peasants oppose the private property system is determined by the main contradiction generated by the private property system of feudal society – the class contradiction between the peasants and the landlord class. However, Jian Bozan said: "They do not oppose the private property system, but only oppose those intolerable differences in property." This means that, without overthrowing the private property system, without destroying feudal society, as long as the differences in property are reduced somewhat and some appropriate reforms are carried out, the class contradictions between the peasants and the landlords can also be eliminated. Where is this the thought of the peasants? This is completely a thorough bourgeois class reconciliation theory and revisionist viewpoint.
    Although Jian Bozan conceals and evades, and flies the flag of Marxism, he still cannot deceive people. Truth is always truth, and no matter how much makeup is applied to fallacy, it is still fallacy. After his trickery is exposed, is it true Marxism or false Marxism? Is it gold or dross? It will be clear at a glance. Just as dog meat sold under the guise of a sheep's head is still dog meat, dog meat cannot be turned into lamb.
    Through the analysis and comparison of the above examples, we can see that the historical views promoted by Jian Bozan are not only not Marxist historical views, but are completely diametrically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. His "Preliminary Opinions" actually mainly oppose using the viewpoint of class and class struggle to study history.
    In order to defend Marxist historical theory, thoroughly eliminate the reactionary influence of Jian Bozan, and prevent his sham Marxist historical theory from continuing to deceive people, we must shout loudly: Pull out the fox's tail hidden behind the word "but"!

    “但”字后面藏私货
    王凌寒
    翦伯赞一向是以马克思主义历史学家自居的。由于他打着马克思主义旗号，有些文章曾经蒙蔽过一些人。他写的《对处理若干历史问题的初步意见》，也是这样一篇文章。因此我们认为有必要在广大读者的面前，拆穿他的西洋镜，让大家看一看，他打的是马克思主义旗号，贩卖的究竟是什么货色？玩弄的究竟是什么手法？
    说穿了真是一文也不值。大家知道，翦伯赞是反对别人对帝王将相“在肯定以后，马上又加以否定”的，可是在他自己写的这篇文章里，就是玩弄了这样的手法。他先是说几句似乎有点象马克思主义的词句，接着就来个“但”怎么怎么，加以否定，于是私货就藏在这“但”字后面了。不信，有下面例子为证：
    翦伯赞说：“农民战争是封建社会的矛盾的最高表现形式，必须承认它对历史所起的推动作用。”这句话合乎历史唯物主义的观点。可是接着他就加以否定说：“但农民战争发生的时期有先有后，规模有大有小，持续的时间有长有短，因而它对封建社会打击的广度和深度也有轻有重，所起的作用也各不相同，不可一概而论”。
    翦伯赞在这里是玩弄抽象肯定、具体否定的手法。表面上看，他说“不可一概而论”，似乎对农民战争多少还肯定了一些。可是接下去看，他是把农民战争起不起作用归结到封建统治阶级的“让步政策”。原来，在翦伯赞看来，对历史起推动作用的，并不是农民的革命，而是统治阶级的让步和恩赐。就在这一段话后面，他作出反动的结论：农民“不反对封建制度”，“不反对地主阶级”。请问：既然农民战争不反对封建制度，它如何能是封建社会矛盾的最高表现形式呢？它对历史如何能起推动作用呢？所以，在“但”字后面的话，直接推翻了“但”字前面的话；前面的话是假的，后面的话才是翦伯赞的真正心里话。
    翦伯赞对农民战争的历史作用的估价，究竟是不是马克思主义的理论呢？让我们把它和毛主席的理论对照一下，立即就可以真伪分明。
    毛主席说：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）这就是说，不论发生时期先后，规模大小，持续时间长短，农民战争对历史总是起推动作用。只有用阶级斗争观点来解释历史，把阶级矛盾的发展看成是推动社会前进、推动新旧社会代谢的观点，才是真正的历史唯物主义观点。翦伯赞却认为“不可一概而论”地承认农民战争对历史所起的推动作用，也就是说农民战争不一定能推动历史前进的，这哪里是什么马克思主义理论呢？它是十足的资产阶级历史唯心主义的反动史学理论。
    翦伯赞又说：“劳动人民，不论是奴隶、农奴或农民，他们都反对压迫剥削”。这句话没有错。可是接着他又以同样卑劣的手法加以否定说：“但他们并不了解被剥削被压迫的基本原因是私有制度，他们不反对私有制度，只反对那些不堪忍受的财产的差别”。翦伯赞的意思是说，农民是不反对封建的私有社会制度的，农民起来反抗，只是想向地主要点东西，缩小一些财产的差别而已。这是站在地主阶级立场上对农民革命的恶毒的诬蔑和咒骂！
    毛主席说：“农民的主要攻击目标是土豪劣绅，不法地主，旁及各种宗法的思想和制度，城里的贪官污吏，乡村的恶劣习惯”。（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）这是因为农民革命的目的是为了摆脱地主阶级的压迫和剥削，而封建社会的私有制度正是地主阶级赖以压迫和剥削农民的制度，农民不反对私有制度就根本无法彻底摆脱地主阶级的压迫和剥削。农民阶级和地主阶级之间的阶级矛盾是由封建社会私有制度决定的，如果农民不反对私有制度，农民和地主阶级之间的阶级矛盾永远也不能消除。因此，不管农民意识不意识，农民反对私有制这一点，是由封建社会私有制度所产生的主要矛盾——农民和地主阶级之间的阶级矛盾决定好了的。然而翦伯赞却说：“他们不反对私有制度，只反对那些不堪忍受的财产的差别”。这就是说，不推翻私有制度，不摧毁封建社会，只要缩小一些财产的差别，适当进行一些改良，农民和地主之间的阶级矛盾也可以消除的。这哪里是农民的思想？这完全是道道地地的资产阶级阶级调和论和修正主义观点。
    尽管翦伯赞遮遮掩掩，躲躲闪闪，打着马克思主义旗号，仍然骗不了人。真理总归是真理，谬论不论怎样涂脂抹粉，总归是谬论。拆穿了他的西洋镜以后，到底是真马克思主义，还是假马克思主义？到底是金玉，还是败絮？就一目了然了。正如挂上了羊头以后卖出来的狗肉还是狗肉，狗肉是变不了羊肉的。
    通过上面例证的分析对照，我们可以看出翦伯赞所宣扬的史学观点不仅不是马克思主义的史学观点，而且完全是与毛主席思想针锋相对的。他的“初步意见”其实主要就是要反对用阶级和阶级斗争观点来研究历史。
    为了保卫马克思主义的史学理论，彻底清除翦伯赞的反动影响，不再让他那种冒牌马克思主义史学理论招摇撞骗，我们要大喝一声：把藏在“但”字后面的狐狸尾巴揪出来！
