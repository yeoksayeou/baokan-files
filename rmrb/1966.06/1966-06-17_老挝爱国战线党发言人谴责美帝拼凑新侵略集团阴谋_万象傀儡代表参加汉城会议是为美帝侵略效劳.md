    New China News Agency, Kang Kai, 13th -- According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio, the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party issued a statement on the 12th, severely condemning and exposing the conspiracy of US imperialism to plan the so-called "Ministerial Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Region" to be held in Seoul.
    The statement condemned US imperialism for instructing the Vientiane puppet regime to participate in this meeting, and pointed out that Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Vientiane puppet regime sending "representatives" to participate in this meeting "once again pierced the cloak of false peace and false neutrality that they have long used to deceive domestic and foreign public opinion."
    The statement said that US imperialism had been planning to convene an "Asian Anti-Communist Foreign Ministers Conference" since 1964 and had carried out a series of conspiracies for this purpose. This conference claims to discuss "economic and cultural cooperation" issues, while its essence is to establish a new US aggression bloc in the Asian and Pacific region.
    The statement said that the purpose of US imperialism in planning to convene this so-called "Ministerial Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Region" is to piece together a new military and political alliance including US vassal states and regions in Asia and the Pacific, in order to encircle the People's Republic of China, oppose the movement of the people of various countries in the region to strive for national independence and defend peace, and first of all, to expand and strengthen the US war of aggression against Vietnam and Laos and strengthen the threat to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia.
    The statement pointed out, "The establishment of this new military alliance is a very serious step taken by the United States in its aggression conspiracy against Asian and Indochinese countries."
    The statement said that US imperialism has long used the Vientiane puppet regime as its reliance in promoting "special warfare" – which is essentially a neo-colonialist war of aggression – in an attempt to turn Laos into its new-type colony and military base. Now, US imperialism is instructing the disastrous Vientiane puppet regime to participate in the Seoul meeting along with other US lackeys, which further leads the Vientiane puppet regime, which serves the US conspiracy to expand its war of aggression against Laos, to the road of serving the US policy of aggression and war against the people of countries in Asia and the Pacific region.
    The statement pointed out that the action of the Vientiane puppet regime in sending "representatives" to participate in this meeting blatantly violates the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos signed in Geneva in 1962 and is also a blatant provocation to the people of Asia and the world.
    The statement said that the Lao people, who are firmly united with the people of the brotherly countries of Indochina and the people of Asia, and who have the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely smash any form of aggression conspiracy and action by US imperialism and its running dogs.

    老挝爱国战线党发言人谴责美帝拼凑新侵略集团阴谋
    万象傀儡代表参加汉城会议是为美帝侵略效劳
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十二日发表声明，严厉谴责和揭露美帝国主义策划的将在汉城举行的所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的阴谋。
    声明谴责美帝国主义指使万象傀儡政权参加这个会议，并且指出，富马亲王和万象傀儡政权派“代表”参加这个会议，“再一次戳穿了它们长久以来用来欺骗国内外舆论的假和平、假中立的外衣。”
    声明说，美帝国主义在一九六四年就一直在策划召开
  “亚洲反共外长会议”，并且为此进行了一系列的阴谋活动。这个会议声称要讨论“经济和文化合作”问题，而实质是为了成立一个美国在亚洲和太平洋地区的新的侵略集团。
    声明说，美帝国主义策划召开这个所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的目的，是要拼凑一个包括亚洲和太平洋地区的美国仆从国家和地区的新的军事政治联盟，以此来包围中华人民共和国，反对这个地区各国人民争取民族独立和保卫和平的运动，首先是为美国扩大和加强对越南和老挝的侵略战争以及加强威胁柬埔寨王国的独立、主权和领土完整。
    声明指出，“成立这个新的军事同盟是美国在对亚洲和印度支那各国的侵略阴谋中跨出的十分严重的一步。”
    声明说，美帝国主义很久以来就利用万象傀儡政权作为它推行“特种战争”——实质是新殖民主义侵略战争的依靠，妄图把老挝变成它的新型殖民地和军事基地。现在，美帝国主义又指使祸国殃民的万象傀儡政权同美国的其他仆从一起参加汉城会议，这就把为美国扩大对老挝的侵略战争阴谋效劳的万象傀儡政权更进一步地带上了为美国推行它对亚洲和太平洋地区各国人民进行侵略和战争政策效劳的道路。
    声明指出，万象傀儡政权派“代表”参加这个会议的行动，明目张胆地违反了一九六二年在日内瓦签订的关于老挝中立声明，也是对亚洲和世界人民的蛮横挑衅。
    声明说，坚决同印度支那各兄弟国家人民和亚洲人民团结起来，并且得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持的老挝人民，必将粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的任何形式的侵略阴谋和行动。
