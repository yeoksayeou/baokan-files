    Youth Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought are Courageous in Thoroughly Destroying Revisionist Ideology
    Revolutionary Young General Mu Zhenkui Wrote an Article Two Years Ago Sharply Criticizing Teachers' Bourgeois Viewpoints
    *Henan Daily* Editor's Note: With boundless excitement, we recommend to our readers the report on revolutionary young general Mu Zhenkui fiercely attacking revisionist viewpoints, and Comrade Mu Zhenkui's article "There are Revisionists in Our School Too," written in 1964. We believe that after reading this report and article, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals will all be encouraged and delighted that our great proletarian revolutionary cause has successors.
    Facts prove once again that Mao Zedong Thought, when combined with the masses, produces a powerful spiritual and material force. The most fundamental reason why Comrade Mu Zhenkui is able to keenly discern the colorful "sugar-coated bullets," see the essence of things in complex phenomena, and dare to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against revisionist viewpoints and all demons and monsters is that he has armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought with strong class feelings, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Mao Zedong Thought is the telescope and microscope of our revolutionary cause; Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb of infinite power. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought allows one to stand tall, see far, observe clearly, understand the subtle, and see the essence through the phenomena; it enables one to be invincible, unconquerable, and victorious in every endeavor.
    Like the people of the whole country, the broad masses of young people in our province have boundless love, boundless faith, and boundless worship for Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is nurturing the younger generation to grow healthily. Imperialists and modern revisionists vainly attempt to "soften" our third and fourth generations and restore capitalism. We sternly warn you: this is a pipe dream and is simply impossible.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th - *Henan Daily* reported on the 18th that Mu Zhenkui, a student at Xuchang No. 1 High School, conducted a critical struggle against the revisionist viewpoints existing among the school's teachers as early as October 1964, and also published Mu Zhenkui's article "There are Revisionists in Our School Too" at that time.
    According to a news report from *Henan Daily*, earlier this month, a big-character poster that caused a sensation throughout the school appeared on the walls of Xuchang No. 1 High School. This big-character poster was an essay paper written by third-grade student Mu Zhenkui for an October 1964 sectional exam. As soon as the big-character poster was put up, it immediately received enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of teachers and students, who said that it was a good article that used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with a clear stand, strong fighting spirit, and dared to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against revisionist viewpoints.
    In October 1964, the school held a sectional exam. Mu Zhenkui, a student from a poor peasant family, wrote an article titled "There are Revisionists in Our School Too," abandoning the exam question and breaking the mold, sharply exposing and criticizing the revisionist thinking of certain teachers. At the time, this article caused a major debate among all the teachers in the school.
    Three completely different attitudes emerged during the debate: some people believed that this was a good article, that it could break the mold, had clear viewpoints, had a fighting spirit, and had a unique style, advocating giving it full marks and displaying it in the outstanding composition section; other people also admitted that the article was well written, but said that it had "biased emotions" and that "the wording was not smooth and did not conform to grammar," and could only be given a general score; still other people openly opposed it, putting on an "authoritative" posture, adding all kinds of accusations to the author, saying things like: "the topic is glaring and harsh," "the content is excessive and biased," "the view of the problem is subjective and one-sided," "it does not answer the teacher's exam question, it is irrelevant, and it violates the traditional teaching rules," and so on. As a result of the debate, the third group prevailed. They neither gave a score nor displayed it, and suppressed the article. One year and seven months later, in this storm of the Great Cultural Revolution, many teachers and students were indignant. They retrieved the article from the teaching and research office and posted it in the form of a big-character poster, allowing all the teachers and students to have a debate. This good article, defending Mao Zedong Thought that was relegated to the cold palace by some teachers, caused a strong reaction as soon as it met with the broad masses of teachers and students, and everyone expressed their support for Comrade Mu Zhenkui's revolutionary actions. The students of Mu Zhenkui's senior year class held a support meeting that day. Huang Wenniu, a class representative and "three-good" student, said enthusiastically, "Mu Zhenkui's article speaks the minds of all the students in our class. We are determined to thoroughly expose and criticize revisionist viewpoints, smash the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to poison young people, and firmly insert the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in our campus and classrooms."
    This young general Mu Zhenkui, who was only eighteen years old at the time, was able to see through the sinister methods of the bourgeoisie corrupting young students at a glance, and dared to stand up and stand at the forefront of the class struggle, thoroughly destroying revisionist ideas, as a result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way and constantly transforming his world outlook. Although Mu Zhenkui came from a poor peasant family, he had in the past also harbored selfish ideas about becoming famous and establishing a career due to the influence of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist ideas in society and from certain teachers at the school. In the spring of 1964, the school's Party branch organized teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's works. With strong class feelings, he began by studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and read through the four volumes of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, writing nearly 100,000 words of notes, absorbing rich nourishment from Chairman Mao's works. From then on, he filled his mind with the great world of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, gradually establishing the idea of serving the revolution and the people wholeheartedly, and his spiritual outlook underwent a fundamental change. There was a saying in the school at that time: "Grades, grades, the student's lifeblood." But Mu Zhenkui did not put "grades" in his eyes. He said, "What's the use of a person learning without revolution, no matter how high the grade is?" Some students regarded obtaining diplomas and going to university as their top priorities, but Mu Zhenkui said, "The needs of the revolution are my first choice, and building communism is my only ideal. I will return to the countryside after graduation. As long as there is a set of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, I will have everything." Because he had lofty revolutionary ideals and a clear class viewpoint, he had the ability to distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and dared to fight to the death against revisionist viewpoints and all demons and monsters. Therefore, under the leadership of Mu Zhenkui, Huang Wenniu, and several other class cadres, this class constantly carried out the struggle against peaceful evolution. As soon as they discovered that a teacher was releasing poison, they immediately disinfected it with Mao Zedong Thought. For example, when a teacher talked about the relationship between politics and profession, he emphasized that students should "study first, get into university first," saying that "if you only engage in political activities, you will regret it yourself if you don't get into university." As soon as this teacher left, Mu Zhenkui and several other activists in studying Chairman Mao's works immediately organized the students to criticize the bourgeois educational viewpoints he had spread, pointing out that this was a great poisonous weed that opposed Chairman Mao's Thought. Once, this teacher tried his best to advocate setting up a grade comparison column in the class. Mu Zhenkui and others immediately pushed it back and pointed out sharply: this is a crooked way to lure students to strive for grades, and we must never be fooled.
    In early 1965, Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist *Yanshan Night Talks* spread to the school. Some teachers recommended it to the students as if they had found a treasure, saying that this book had strong ideological and artistic qualities and was a must-read. In order to promote this book, they also opened the door wide, stipulating that anyone who borrowed this book could borrow it from the library without a borrower's card, without registration, and without restrictions. At that time, Yan Zhenhu, a student in Class 661, who was extremely active in studying Chairman Mao's works, borrowed Volume 3 of *Yanshan Night Talks* out of curiosity. When he read the first article, "Poor in Wealth but Not in Spirit," he found that the article praised the backbone of the rich and the dead, and he felt very uncomfortable. He took a series of questions to Mu Zhenkui, the secretary of the class's Communist Youth League branch at the time, and asked him to see if the article was poisonous. After Mu Zhenkui read the article, he found Yan Zhenhu and Feng Tianlu (Feng had also read the article) together, and they analyzed the article using Chairman Mao's ideological viewpoints, keenly realizing that none of the "poor scholars" praised in the article were working people, but all were bankrupt landlords. Their purpose was to have us learn the backbone of the landlord class and not allow young people to follow the Party. After the three of them reached a consensus, they talked about their views to all the students in the class. From then on, *Yanshan Night Talks* also lost its market in this class. The students in this class resisted black books and read Chairman Mao's works extensively, but the homeroom teacher said to the students that studying Chairman Mao's works was secondary, and to study when there was time and not to study when there was no time. This remark aroused the dissatisfaction of all the students in the class. Mu Zhenkui, Huang Wenniu, and several other students, representing the whole class, reported to Li Lin, the deputy secretary of the Party branch at the time, saying: We want to study Chairman Mao's works extensively and will not allow the homeroom teacher to release poison in the class. The Party branch supported the revolutionary actions of the students in this class and immediately replaced the homeroom teacher.
    Under the leadership and support of the school's Party branch, this class has achieved lively and vigorous development in all aspects of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness through continuous struggle against bourgeois ideology, becoming a pacesetter for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way throughout the school. The example of this class and the growth of Mu Zhenkui vividly proves that China's younger generation is the successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have the greatest courage to fear neither heaven nor earth, to dare to smash the old world and create a new world. All bourgeois "authorities," "scholars," "experts," etc., are nothing in their eyes.

    毛泽东思想哺育的青年勇于大破修正主义思想
    革命小将慕振奎前年著文尖锐批判教师的资产阶级观点
    《河南日报》编者按：我们以无比兴奋的心情，向读者推荐革命小将慕振奎向修正主义观点猛烈开火的报道，和慕振奎同学在一九六四年所写的《我们学校里也有修正主义者》的文章。我们相信，广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，读了这篇报道和文章之后，都一定会为我们伟大的无产阶级革命事业后继有人而感到欢欣鼓舞，高兴万分。
    事实再一次证明，毛泽东思想一同群众结合，就会产生强大的精神力量和物质力量。慕振奎同学所以能够敏锐地识破五颜六色的“糖衣炮弹”，在纷繁复杂的现象中看到事物的本质，所以敢于同修正主义观点，以及一切牛鬼蛇神进行针锋相对的斗争，最根本的原因，就是由于他带着强烈的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑。毛泽东思想是我们革命事业的望远镜和显微镜，毛泽东思想是威力无穷的精神原子弹。掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够站得高，看得远，明察秋毫，见微知著，透过现象，看到本质；就能无坚不摧，无攻不克，无往而不胜。
    我省广大青年和全省全国人民一样，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。毛泽东思想哺育着青年一代在健康地成长。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者，妄想“软化”我国第三代、第四代，实行资本主义复辟，我们正告你们：这是白日作梦，根本不可能。
    据新华社郑州十九日电　《河南日报》十八日报道了许昌第一高中学生慕振奎早在一九六四年十月对该校教师中存在的修正主义观点进行批判斗争的经过，同时发表了慕振奎当时写的一篇《我们学校里也有修正主义者》的文章。
    《河南日报》的消息说，本月上旬，在许昌第一高中的墙壁上，出现了一张轰动全校的大字报。这张大字报，是三年级学生慕振奎一九六四年十月段考的一篇作文卷子。大字报一经贴出，立即得到广大师生的热烈赞扬，说这是一篇以毛泽东思想为武器，立场鲜明，战斗性强，敢于向修正主义观点进行针锋相对斗争的好文章。
    一九六四年十月，该校举行段考，慕振奎这个出身于贫农家庭的学生，针对学校当时存在的严重问题，抛开考题，打破框框，写了一篇题为《我们学校里也有修正主义者》的文章，尖锐地揭露、批判某些教师的修正主义思想。这篇文章当时就在全校教师中引起了一场大辩论。
    辩论中出现了三种截然不同的态度：一种人认为，这是一篇好文章，它能打破框框，观点明确，有斗争性，有独特风格，主张给满分，并在优秀作文栏里展出；另一种人也承认文章写得好，但又说“有偏激情绪”，“文词不通顺，不合乎文法”等，只能给一般分；再一种人则公开反对，他们摆出一副“权威”的姿态，给作者加上种种罪名，说什么：“题目扎眼刺耳”，“内容过火偏激”，“看问题主观片面”，“不按老师的考题作，文不对题，违犯了传统的教学规程”等等。辩论的结果，第三种人占了上风，他们既不给划分，更不展出，把文章压了起来。时隔一年零七个月，在这次文化大革命的风暴中，许多师生愤愤不平，他们从教导处追出这篇文章，用大字报形式张贴出来，让全校师生展开辩论。这篇被某些教师打入冷宫的捍卫毛泽东思想的好文章，一经与广大师生见面，就引起了强烈的反应，大家纷纷表示声援慕振奎同学的革命举动。慕振奎所在的高三班同学，当天就举行了声援会，班代表、三好学生黄稳妞激奋地发言说：“慕振奎的文章说出了我们全班同学的心里话，我们决心彻底揭露批判修正主义观点，粉碎资产阶级毒害青年的阴谋，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢固地插在我们的校园里、课堂上。”
    慕振奎这位当时年刚十八岁的小将，所以能一眼识破资产阶级腐蚀青年学生的阴险手法，并且敢于挺身而出，站在阶级斗争的前列，大破修正主义思想，是活学活用毛主席著作，不断改造自己的世界观的结果。慕振奎虽然出身于贫农家庭，但由于社会上和学校某些教师封建主义、资本主义、修正主义思想的影响，过去也曾产生过成名成家的私心杂念。一九六四年春天，学校党支部组织师生学习毛主席著作，他带着强烈的阶级感情，从学习《纪念白求恩》开始，通读了《毛泽东选集》四卷，写了近十万字的心得笔记，从毛主席著作中吸取了丰富的营养。从此，头脑里装上了中国革命和世界革命的大天地，逐步树立了一心为革命、一心为人民的思想，精神面貌发生了根本变化。在学校里曾有这样的说法：“分、分，学生的命根。”但慕振奎却不把“分”放在眼里，他说：“一个人学了不革命，分再高有啥用？”有些学生把拿文凭、考大学看作自己的头等大事，但慕振奎却说：“革命需要是我的第一志愿，建设共产主义是我的唯一理想。我毕业后要回农村去，只要有一套《毛泽东选集》，就什么都有了。”由于他有了远大的革命理想，有了明确的阶级观点，就有了辨别香花和毒草的能力，敢于同修正主义观点和一切牛鬼蛇神作拼死的斗争。因此，这个班在慕振奎、黄稳妞等几位班干部的带动下，不断地进行着反和平演变的斗争。他们只要一发现某教师放毒，就立即用毛泽东思想进行消毒。如某教师讲政治与业务的关系时，强调当学生要“读书第一，升学第一”，说什么“光搞政治活动，到时候考不上大学您自己会后悔的”等。这个教师刚一出门，慕振奎等几位学习毛主席著作积极分子，就立即组织同学批判他所散布的资产阶级教育观点，指出这是反对毛主席思想的大毒草。有一次，这个教师竭力主张在班上办起考分对比栏，慕振奎等当场就给他打了回去，并一针见血地指出：这是引诱学生为考分而奋斗的邪门，坚决不能上当。
    一九六五年初，邓拓反党反社会主义的《燕山夜话》传到了该校，一些教师如获至宝地向学生推荐说，此书思想性强，艺术性高，不可不读。为宣扬此书，他们还大开方便之门，规定：凡借阅此书的人，图书室可以不要借书证，不予登记，不受限制等。当时学习毛主席著作极为活跃的六六一班同学阎振虎，以好奇的心情借来《燕山夜话》第三集，当他读了头一篇《人穷志不穷》的文章后，就发现文中颂扬的全是富人死人的骨气，心里觉得很不是味。他带着一连串问题找当时本班团支部书记慕振奎，让他看一看这篇文章是不是有毒。慕振奎读了这篇文章后，又把阎振虎、冯天禄（冯也读过这篇文章）找到一起，他们用毛主席的思想观点对文章作了分析，敏锐地意识到文中所颂扬的“贫士”没有一个是劳动人民，全是破落地主。其目的是要我们学地主阶级的骨气，不让青年跟党走。他们三人看法一致以后，就在全班同学中谈了他们的看法。从此，《燕山夜话》在这个班也就没有市场了。这个班的同学抵制黑书，大读毛主席著作，而班主任却对学生说，学毛主席著作是次要的，有时间就学，没有时间就不学。这话引起了全班同学的不满，慕振奎、黄稳妞等几位同学代表全班向当时的党支部副书记李林同志汇报说：我们要大学毛主席著作，不允许班主任在班上放毒。党支部支持了这班同学的革命行动，立即撤换了这位班主任。
    这个班在学校党支部的领导和支持下，通过不断与资产阶级思想斗争，在德智体诸方面都得到了生动活泼地发展，成为全校活学活用毛主席著作的尖子。这个班和慕振奎成长的事例，生动地证明：我国青年一代，是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，他们具有天不怕、地不怕，敢于粉碎旧世界，创造新世界的最大勇气，什么资产阶级“权威”、“学者”、“专家”等等，在他们的心目中统统不在话下。
