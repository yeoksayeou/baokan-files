    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 5th dispatch: Reports from the Indonesian News Agency and newspapers indicate that Indonesian right-wing forces are conspiring to obstruct and undermine the work of the Chinese government in receiving victimized overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China.
    The Chinese Foreign Ministry had notified the Indonesian government that, since the Indonesian government refused to send back the victimized overseas Chinese, the Chinese government had decided to dispatch ships to Indonesia in the near future to receive the victimized overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China. The Indonesian official Antara News Agency issued a malicious report on May 25, stating: "Government officials here believe that the actions that the Chinese government may take to transport its citizens from Indonesia to the People's Republic of China will not be very successful."
    This news agency published on May 21 a "suggestion" from the Jakarta Commercial Workers Union of the Indonesian Muslim Workers Union Federation, which is controlled by right-wing forces. It clamored for "strict security measures and supervision" to be implemented on "ships transporting overseas Chinese from Indonesia back to mainland China," and to conduct "investigations of overseas Chinese who wish to return to their country." The "suggestion" stated that this was because the overseas Chinese might have "direct or indirect involvement" in the "September 30th Movement," and "if that is the case, they should be given corresponding punishment in this country." The "suggestion" also clamored that "it should be prevented" from overseas Chinese from taking their property and funds back to their country.
    In addition, according to a report in the Jakarta newspaper "The Fire of the Five Principles of Nation-Building," Fidaus Wajdi, the head of the "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization," who has been actively acting as a pawn for the right-wing military clique in opposing China, communism, and the people, also viciously clamored on May 22 to drive the overseas Chinese who demand to return to their country to an island. It is worth noting that a commentary in the May 29th edition of the "Indonesian Herald" even revealed the right-wing military regime's conspiracy to forcibly send overseas Chinese to Taiwan, saying that "Taiwan will certainly be willing to accept them." This newspaper, which has close ties with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, even used terms such as "Communist China" and "Mainland China" to serve the US's conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

    印尼右派阴谋阻挠我接运自愿返国难侨
    叫嚷要对归侨进行“调查”和流放，甚至强迫送往台湾
    新华社五日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚通讯社和报刊的报道表明，印尼右派势力正在阴谋阻挠和破坏中国政府接回自愿返国的受害华侨的工作。
    中国外交部曾经通知印度尼西亚政府，由于印度尼西亚政府不肯送回受害华侨，中国政府决定在最近期间派遣船只前往印度尼西亚，接回自愿返国的受害华侨。印尼官方的安塔拉通讯社五月二十五日发出一条别有用心的报道说：“这里的政府人士认为，中国政府为了把它的公民从印度尼西亚运往中华人民共和国而可能采取的行动不会很成功”。
    这家通讯社五月二十一日发表了被右派势力把持的印度尼西亚穆斯林工会联合会雅加达商业职工会的一个“建议”，它叫嚷要对“从印度尼西亚接运华侨返回中国大陆的船只，实行严格的安全措施和监督”，对“希望回国的华侨进行调查”。“建议”说什么这样做是因为华侨可能同“九·三○运动”“有直接或间接的牵连”，“如果是那样，就应当在这个国家内给他们以相应的惩罚”。“建议”还叫嚷“应当防止”华侨携带自己的财物和资金回国。
    此外，据雅加达《建国五项原则之火报》报道，一直积极充当右派军人集团反华、反共、反人民打手的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的头目菲达乌斯·瓦吉，五月二十二日还恶毒地叫嚷要把要求回国的华侨赶到一个岛上去。值得注意的是，五月二十九日的《印度尼西亚先驱报》的一篇评论，甚至透露了右派军人政权准备把华侨强迫送到台湾去的阴谋，说什么“台湾一定可能愿意接受他们”的。这家同印度尼西亚外交部有密切关系的报纸竟然使用了“共产党中国”、“大陆中国”这种字眼，为美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。
