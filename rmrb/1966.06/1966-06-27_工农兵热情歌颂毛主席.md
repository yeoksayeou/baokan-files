Workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao
Jinan workers' revolutionary song concert is magnificent
On the evening of June 9, 4,000 workers from Jinan, Shandong Province, held a magnificent revolutionary song concert at the Workers' Cultural Palace. With a spirited fighting posture and a powerful, resonant voice, they enthusiastically praised the great thought of Mao Zedong, praised the great socialist motherland, and angrily denounced the anti-party, anti-socialist gang of four. The concert fully demonstrated the workers' heroic spirit of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought and sweeping away all ghosts and monsters in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The workers, from their own personal experiences, deeply felt that Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and that Mao Zedong thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the greatest and most brilliant thought guiding the Chinese revolution and the world revolution from victory to victory. Therefore, praising Mao Zedong thought, propagating Mao Zedong thought, and defending Mao Zedong thought, like a huge red thread, ran through the entire concert from beginning to end. The workers sang enthusiastically, "Singing Praises to Mao Zedong," "Reading Chairman Mao's Works," "Chairman Mao's Words Are in My Heart," "The Working Class Raises the Red Flag," "The Working Class Has a Backbone," and other songs, expressing their determination to firmly follow Chairman Mao's words and always follow Chairman Mao.

The two-and-a-half-hour revolutionary song concert ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." At this concert, 40 revolutionary songs were performed, including 7 revolutionary songs created by Jinan workers.

Shenyang workers use revolutionary battle songs to strike down the gang of four
The mass singing of revolutionary songs is flourishing in Shenyang City. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, sing revolutionary battle songs to sweep away all ghosts and monsters. They enthusiastically praise the great leader Mao Zedong and the great Communist Party of China, and praise the great proletarian cultural revolution.

On the evenings of June 1 and 11, a grand concert with more than ten thousand workers and masses participating was held in Zhongshan Park, the center of Shenyang City.

The broad masses of workers in the city, as the main force, have thrown themselves into the great proletarian cultural revolution. Many of them are active learners of Chairman Mao's works and "five-good" workers. They expressed their boundless love for the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism with revolutionary songs, showing the heroic spirit of the working class in the proletarian cultural revolution to thoroughly uproot the anti-party, anti-socialist black line and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Li Lianyuan, a young female worker from the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory and the secretary of the "four-good" youth league branch of Liaoning Province, performed "The People's Commune Is a Golden Bridge" and "Dare to Change the Heavens and Earth" for more than ten thousand audiences for the first time on the stage. She said: "The stage is a battlefield, and revolutionary songs are weapons. The revolutionary songs we workers sing are a blow to the anti-party, anti-socialist gang of four, a defense of the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism." The staff of the Shenyang Railway Bureau's train section also actively participated in the performance. Luggage handler Song Jili just returned from Beijing in the morning, heard that there would be a concert in the evening, and after handing over his shift, he joined the rehearsal team. He said: "The working class performing revolutionary songs on stage is a major event to open fire on the anti-party gang of four and occupy the cultural front, showing the strength of the working class in the cultural revolution." Wu Dianqing, a 67-year-old family member of an employee of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, and more than 200 employees and family members of the factory sang "Socialism Is Good" together. She said: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will never forgive him."

In this struggle to sing revolutionary songs and denounce ghosts and monsters, many worker amateur composers wrote songs and composed music to praise the great proletarian cultural revolution. They said: "The pen in our hands is given by Chairman Mao. We will use this pen to fiercely attack the bourgeois 'authorities' and thoroughly uproot the anti-party, anti-socialist black line."

Changsha workers, peasants, and soldiers write and perform revolutionary literature and art
In the midst of the surging momentum of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers rising up to launch a fierce attack on the anti-party, anti-socialist black line, a mass revolutionary literary and artistic creation and performance activity is flourishing in Changsha, Hunan Province. In the past two weeks, the Workers' Cultural Palace, the Youth Palace, and other five venues, as well as more than 400 grassroots units throughout the city, have performed revolutionary literary and artistic programs and films more than 200 times, with more than 300,000 people participating in the activities.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers, as the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution, actively participated in the revolutionary cultural activities. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, full of proletarian revolutionary passion, enthusiastically praised the Party and Chairman Mao, praised Mao Zedong thought, praised socialism, and praised the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They used revolutionary literature and art to counterattack the bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" and sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Liu Zhengliang, a worker from the Sixth Construction Engineering Company of Hunan Province, regarded revolutionary literature and art as a weapon to attack the Deng Tuo gang of four and created and sang "Thoroughly Smash the 'Three Families Village'." He also actively helped relevant units to carry out revolutionary literary and artistic activities. Lao workers Luo Kaiyun and Song Wenxing of Changsha Power Plant, with their boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for anti-party, anti-socialist elements, recited their own poems "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Gold" and "Denouncing the Deng Tuo Gang of Four" at the revolutionary literary and artistic performance in the factory. The revolutionary literary and artistic programs performed by workers, peasants, and soldiers expressed the common voice of the masses, and the audience's reaction was extremely strong.

Longhua Automobile Factory holds an art performance
The workers of the national model enterprise, the First Automobile Works in Changchun, recently held a special art performance, expressing the workers' boundless admiration and love for the great thought of Mao Zedong, and showing their firm revolutionary will to sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

Many of the programs performed by the automobile workers, such as the group speech "Revolutionary Praise," the chorus "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and the dance "Chairman Mao's Works Cultivate New People," enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong thought as the setting sun that never falls, and that revolution relies on Mao Zedong thought. The workers' performance of "Using Our Own Steel to Make Our Own Cars," "Using Our Own Oil to Drive Our Own Cars," and "Automobile Workers Learn from Daqing" enthusiastically praised the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the three red banners of the people's commune, reflecting the victories achieved by the workers of our country armed with Mao Zedong thought under the guidance of the three red banners. The automobile workers, with ironclad facts and sharp literary and artistic weapons, strongly counterattacked the "Three Families Village" gang of four's attacks on the Party and socialism, and dealt a heavy blow to the anti-party, anti-socialist ghosts and monsters.

One hundred family members of automobile workers also participated in the performance, showing the determination of the family members of automobile workers to actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    工农兵热情歌颂毛主席
    济南职工革命歌曲演唱会气势磅礴
    山东济南市四千名职工于九日晚在工人文化宫举行了一次气势磅礴的革命歌曲演唱大会。他们以昂扬的战斗姿态，雄壮嘹亮的歌声，热烈地歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂伟大的社会主义祖国，愤怒地声讨反党反社会主义的黑帮。演唱会充分显示出职工们在社会主义文化大革命的浪潮中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的英雄气概。
    职工们从自己的亲身经历中，深深体会到，毛主席是中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖，毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰，是指导中国革命和世界革命从胜利走向胜利最伟大最光辉的思想。因而，歌颂毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，象一根巨大的红线，从始到终贯穿着整个演唱会。职工们热情洋溢地高歌《歌唱毛泽东》、《读毛主席的书》、《毛主席话儿记心上》、《工人阶级举红旗》、《工人阶级硬骨头》等歌曲，表达了他们坚决听毛主席的话、永远跟着毛主席走的决心。
    历时两个多小时的革命歌曲演唱会，最后在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中结束。在这次演唱会上，共演唱了四十多首革命歌曲，其中有七首革命歌曲是济南市职工自己创作的。

    沈阳市群众性大唱革命歌曲活动正在蓬勃发展。广大工农兵以高昂的革命热情，高唱革命战歌，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。他们热情地歌颂伟大的领袖毛泽东和伟大的中国共产党，歌颂伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    六月一日和十一日晚上，在沈阳市中心的中山公园举行了万余职工群众参加的盛大音乐会。
    全市广大工人群众以主力军的姿态，投入到伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗中来，他们有许多人是学习毛主席著作的积极分子和“五好”职工。他们用革命的歌声，表达了对党、对毛主席和对社会主义的无限热爱，显示了工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，彻底铲除反党反社会主义黑线，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的英雄气概。沈阳市冶金机械修造厂青年女工、辽宁省共青团“四好”团支部书记李连媛，在音乐会上，第一次登台为一万多观众演唱了《人民公社是金桥》和《敢教日月换新天》。她说：“舞台就是战场，革命歌曲就是武器。我们工人唱的革命歌曲就是向反党反社会主义黑帮开火，就是保卫党，保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义。”沈阳铁路局列车段员工也积极参加演唱。行李员宋记礼早晨才从北京出乘回来，听说晚上举行音乐会，交完班就参加演出队练习。他说：“工人阶级登台演唱革命歌曲，是向反党黑帮开火，占领文艺阵地的大事，是显示我们工人阶级在文化大革命中的力量。”机车车辆厂六十七岁的职工家属吴殿清，和工厂的二百多职工与家属一起合唱《社会主义好》。她说：毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，谁要反对毛主席，我们绝不饶他。
    在这场大唱革命歌曲，声讨牛鬼蛇神的斗争中，许多工人业余作曲家写歌作曲，歌颂伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。他们说：我们手里的笔是毛主席给的，我们要用这支笔向资产阶级“权威”猛烈开火，彻底铲除反党反社会主义的黑线。
