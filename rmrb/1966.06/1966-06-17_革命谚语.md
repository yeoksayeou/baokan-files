    Revolutionary Proverbs
    With Chairman Mao’s words in our hearts,
    A thousand difficulties and ten thousand hardships are swept away.
    The eagle soars in the sky,
    It must have strong wings;
    The fighter with foresight and vision,
    Relies on Mao Zedong Thought.
    Class struggle is always kept in mind,
    The revolutionary family history is passed down from generation to generation.
    If you have a class account in your heart,
    You can grasp the gun tightly in your hand.
    If you have the enemy's situation in your mind,
    Your strength is infinitely great.
    If you have class hatred in your heart,
    Your body grows a thousand pounds of strength.
    The reason why an eagle can fly high,
    Is because it has been tempered by the storm;
    The reason why a pine on the cliff can remain evergreen,
    Is because it has endured the impact of frost and snow;
    The reason why a soldier is strong,
    Is because he has undergone the test of class struggle.

    革命谚语
    毛主席的话记心上，
    千难万难一扫光。
    苍鹰凌空翱翔，
    要有矫健的翅膀；
    战士高瞻远瞩，
    要靠毛泽东思想。
    阶级斗争时时牢记，
    革命家谱代代相传。
    心中有本阶级账，
    就能握紧手中枪。
    脑里有敌情，
    力量大无穷。
    心有阶级仇，
    身长千斤力。
    雄鹰之所以能高飞，
    是因为经过了风暴的锻炼；
    岩松之所以能长青，
    是因为经受了霜雪的冲击；
    战士之所以坚强，
    是因为经过了阶级斗争的考验。
