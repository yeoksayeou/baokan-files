    According to Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, the head of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace issued a statement today, pointing out that Balaguer, the United States' faithful lackey, recently came to power in the Dominican "election" farce concocted by the United States, which is a continuation of the United States' blatant interference in the country since last year, in order to maintain its rule over the Dominican Republic. US imperialism has once again nakedly exposed itself as the most ferocious enemy of the Dominican people.
    The head reiterated: The Chinese people have always warmly sympathized with and firmly supported the just struggle of the Dominican people, and will always stand by them. The head expressed his belief that as long as the Dominican people persist in unity, persist in struggle, and take the road of people's war, they will surely bury Balaguer and his American masters, and achieve independence and liberation.
    In his statement, the head pointed out that from June 1st to 3rd, the US aggressors staged a so-called "election" performance in the Dominican Republic. Everyone knows that this is an ugly farce manufactured under the bayonets of the United States. This is a continuation of the United States' blatant interference in the country since its armed invasion of the Dominican Republic on April 28th last year. The United States has imposed a pro-American puppet government on the Dominican people in order to continue to maintain US rule over the Dominican Republic. US imperialism has once again nakedly exposed itself as the most ferocious enemy of the Dominican people.
    The head finally stated that the Chinese people have always warmly sympathized with and firmly supported the just struggle of the Dominican people, and will always stand by them. We believe that the heroic Dominican people, with a tradition of struggle, will surely bury Balaguer and his American masters and achieve independence and liberation, as long as they persist in unity, persist in struggle, and take the road of people's war.

    我和委会负责人谴责美帝在多米尼加玩弄伪选骗局
    坚决支持多米尼加人民反美斗争
    据新华社十四日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会负责人今天发表谈话指出，美国的忠实走狗巴拉格最近在美国炮制的多米尼加“选举”骗局中上台，是美国去年以来对这个国家进行的蛮横干涉的继续，以便维持它对多米尼加的统治。美帝国主义再一次赤裸裸暴露出它是多米尼加人民最凶恶的敌人。
    负责人重申：中国人民一贯热烈同情和坚决支持多米尼加人民的正义斗争，永远站在他们一边。负责人表示相信，多米尼加人民只要坚持团结，坚持斗争，走人民战争的道路，就一定能埋葬巴拉格之流及其美国主子，取得独立和解放。
    负责人在谈话中指出，从六月一日到三日，美国侵略者在多米尼加一手炮制了一次所谓“选举”的表演。谁都知道，这是在美国刺刀尖下所制造的一幕丑剧。这是美国去年四月二十八日武装侵略多米尼加以来对这个国家进行的蛮横干涉的继续，美国把一个亲美傀儡政府强加在多米尼加人民头上，以便继续维持美国对多米尼加的统治。美帝国主义再一次赤裸裸暴露出它是多米尼加人民最凶恶的敌人。
    负责人最后表示，中国人民一贯热烈同情和坚决支持多米尼加人民的正义斗争，永远站在他们一边。我们相信，英雄的、富有斗争传统的多米尼加人民，只要坚持团结，坚持斗争，走人民战争的道路，就一定能埋葬巴拉格之流及其美国主子，取得独立和解放。
