    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, June 2nd: Under the instigation of US and British imperialism, the Indonesian right-wing military regime sent its Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, to hold talks with the "Malaysian" authorities, and formally announced on the 1st the end of the confrontation with "Malaysia."
      "Malaysia" is a neo-colonialist product cobbled together by Britain with the support of the United States. After the Indonesian right-wing military clique seized power, it openly abandoned the policy of confrontation with "Malaysia," exposing that the backing of this reactionary group is imperialism and neo-colonialism.
    This meeting began on May 29th and ended on June 1st. Participants included Adam Malik, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, and Razak, Deputy Prime Minister of "Malaysia." According to a press release issued after the meeting, Malik and Razak "freely and frankly exchanged views" in a spirit of "brotherhood." The press release stated: "After carefully and thoroughly discussing issues related to relations between the two countries, they unanimously agreed to propose to their respective governments the principles on which to restore friendly relations between the two countries, in order to seek approval." The press release also said: Malik and Razak "unanimously agreed to maintain direct and continuous contact between the two governments."
    It is reported that while Malik and Razak were holding talks, military experts from both sides discussed how to achieve an effective ceasefire and the repatriation of approximately 300 Indonesian prisoners of war in "Malaysia."
    "Malaysian" Prime Minister Rahman expressed great pleasure with the outcome of this meeting. He said this was a "greatest victory."
    Malik declared at a press conference held after the release of the press communiqué: "We no longer have any confrontation." He also said that all outstanding issues between Indonesia and Malaysia had been resolved, and the restoration of diplomatic relations would be realized at "an appropriate time." Razak said at the press conference: "The Bangkok talks mark the beginning of a new era of peaceful cooperation." He also expressed his belief that Indonesia and "Malaysia" "can live together peacefully and amicably and cooperate with each other."
    Shortly after the Indonesian right-wing military coup, Suharto publicly expressed "welcome to a peaceful resolution of the (Malaysia) dispute." At the same time, US and British imperialism and their running dogs were busy bringing the two sides together. The British *Times* openly stated that the Indonesian right-wing military regime's easing of confrontation with "Malaysia" was "a prerequisite for obtaining urgently needed foreign aid." Some running dogs of the United States, such as the Sato government and the Thanom group, have conducted busy behind-the-scenes activities to promote the formal announcement of reconciliation and cooperation between the Indonesian right-wing military group and "Malaysia."

### 印尼右派政权充当美帝走卒的面目再次暴露  公然宣布结束同“马来西亚”的对抗

    印尼右派政权充当美帝走卒的面目再次暴露
    公然宣布结束同“马来西亚”的对抗
    据新华社二日讯　曼谷消息：在美英帝国主义的授意下，印度尼西亚右派军人政权派出它的副总理兼外交部长同“马来西亚”当局在泰国首都曼谷举行会谈，并且在一日正式宣布结束同“马来西亚”的对抗。
      “马来西亚”是英国在美国的支持下拼凑起来的新殖民主义产物。印度尼西亚右派军人集团篡夺了政权后，公开抛弃对抗“马来西亚”的政策，暴露出这个反动集团的后台是帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    这次会谈从五月二十九日开始，六月一日结束。参加会谈的有印度尼西亚右派军人政权的副总理兼外交部长阿达姆·马利克和“马来西亚”副总理拉扎克。会谈后双方发表的新闻公报说，马利克同拉扎克本着“兄弟情谊”，“自由和坦率地交换了意见。”公报说：“他们在谨慎和彻底地讨论了同两国关系有关的问题以后，一致同意向各自的政府提出恢复两国友好关系所依据的原则，以谋求批准。”公报还说：马利克和拉扎克“一致同意保持两国政府间的直接和不断的接触。”
    据报道，在马利克和拉扎克会谈的同时，双方的军事专家讨论了如何实现有效的停火和遣返在“马来西亚”的大约三百名印尼俘虏的问题。
    “马来西亚”总理拉赫曼对这次会谈的结果表示很高兴。他说，这是一个“最伟大的胜利”。
    马利克在新闻公报发表后举行的记者招待会上宣称：“我们已不再有任何对抗了”。他还说：印度尼西亚同马来西亚之间一切悬而未决的问题已经解决，双方外交关系的恢复也将在“适当的时候实现”。拉扎克在记者招待会上说：“曼谷会谈标志着和平合作的新纪元的开始”。他还表示相信印度尼西亚和“马来西亚”“能够和平友好地相处，并彼此合作。”
    印尼右派军人政变以后不久，苏哈托就公开表示“欢迎和平解决（马来西亚）争端”。同时，美英帝国主义及其走卒就忙着把它们两家拉在一起。英国《泰晤士报》公开表示，印度尼西亚右派军人政权缓和对“马来西亚”的对抗是“作为取得迫切需要的外援的一个先决条件”。美国的一些走卒佐藤政府、他侬集团等，更进行了繁忙的幕后活动，促成了印尼右派军人集团同“马来西亚”双方正式宣布和解和合作。
