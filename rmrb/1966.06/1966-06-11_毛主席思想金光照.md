    The golden light of Mao Zedong Thought shines,
    The red flag of the Cultural Revolution flutters,
    Wielding sledgehammers and beating war drums,
    Shipyard workers are full of heroic spirit!
    We sing loudly while wielding hammers during the day,
    To build ships for the revolution;
    We burn with anger as we write at night,
    Vowing to force the anti-Party elements to hand over their guns.

    毛主席思想金光照
　　上海沪东造船厂工人　居有松
    毛主席思想金光照，
    文化革命红旗飘，
    挥舞大锤擂战鼓，
    造船工人斗志豪！
    白天挥锤高声唱，
    要为革命把船造；
    夜间举笔怒火烧，
    誓逼反党分子把枪缴。
