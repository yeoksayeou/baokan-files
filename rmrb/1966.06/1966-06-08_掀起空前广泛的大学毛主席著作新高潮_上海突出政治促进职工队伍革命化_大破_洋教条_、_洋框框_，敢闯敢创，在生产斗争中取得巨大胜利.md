    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th - The broad masses of workers in Shanghai, who have consistently adhered to holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forging ahead courageously, have launched an unprecedentedly broad new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works this year on the basis of deeply developing the socialist education movement, and their spiritual outlook has undergone significant changes. In the current high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have further liberated their thinking, further developed their revolutionary spirit, and further raised their class consciousness, displaying high spirits in the struggle for production and seizing one great victory after another.

    At present, the Shanghai industrial front presents a thriving scene. In the first five months of this year, the city's total industrial output value increased substantially compared with the same period last year; production has steadily increased, especially for important products urgently needed by the state, such as steel, steel products, metal cutting machine tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, automobiles, tractors, transistors, and cotton yarn, all of which have seen significant increases in production, with some outputs doubling; product quality has steadily improved, and a batch of new products with the level of the 1960s have been successfully trial-produced. The consumption of coal, wood, metal materials, and chemical raw materials has decreased; compared with the same period last year, the cost of comparable products has decreased, and the profits submitted to the state have increased. Mass technical innovation and technical revolution activities are very active.

    All of this shows that in the first year of China's Third Five-Year Plan, Shanghai, an important industrial base in our country, is advancing with solid steps and strides in industrial production.

    Spirit transforms into matter. The new high tide in Shanghai's industrial production is the result of emphasizing politics, emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, and promoting the revolutionization of the workforce. This year, the increased production in various industries such as metallurgy, instrumentation, chemical industry, light industry, and handicrafts was not achieved by increasing equipment or engaging in capital construction, but by relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the consciousness of the working masses. This once again demonstrates a great truth: in the struggle for production, it is people who play the decisive role; people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most powerful productive force, capable of overcoming any difficulties, scaling any peaks, and creating any miracles.

    Many factories adhere to putting Mao Zedong Thought in command in all their work, adhere to arming the minds of workers with Mao Zedong Thought, and in the process of realizing the revolutionization of people, first grasp the revolutionization of leading cadres, and put political and ideological work in the first place of all work. This is a clear feature of the current new high tide of industrial production.

    In this year's new high tide of industrial production, workers in many factories in Shanghai have learned from the People's Liberation Army, from Daqing, and from Jiao Yulu, accelerating the pace of revolutionization; in particular, leading cadres in many factories have also compared themselves to Jiao Yulu, further transforming their thinking, improving their work style, going deep into the grassroots, and integrating with the masses. They regard enterprises not only as positions for engaging in production, but also as positions for carrying out the struggle to promote the proletarian ideology and eliminate the bourgeois ideology. In the extensive discussions on the relationship between politics and business conducted in many factories throughout the city, workers criticized all kinds of erroneous views, such as emphasizing business over politics or giving equal importance to both. "How Chairman Mao says it, that's how I do it" has become the conscious code of conduct for the broad masses of workers. Through in-depth discussions, workers have become more firmly aware that production depends on people, people depend on thought, and with Mao Zedong Thought, people can become the smartest and bravest. They say that whether one listens to Chairman Mao, whether one follows the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, and whether one regards Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work, this is the watershed between taking the socialist road and taking the capitalist road, between revolution and counter-revolution.

    Emphasizing politics and relying on the masses makes everything easier, and many factories are becoming more and more consciously leading production in this way. In order to improve the quality of "Dacron," the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill had tried hundreds of technical measures, but the results were not significant. Later, the leadership disclosed the situation to the masses and held symposiums on the spot to listen to the opinions of the front-line production workers. The workers studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that improving product quality is essentially a matter of serving the people wholeheartedly. They treated product quality with the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly, and in a few days, they removed the long-standing "mountain" of difficulty.

    Through the process of trial-producing watches twice, the leaders of the Shanghai Watch Factory deeply realized that only with a strong ideology can one fight hard battles and conquer "high, precise, and advanced" technologies. Previously, when trial-producing automatic calendar watches, they assigned the task to a few people with good technical skills, focusing on technology for technology's sake. Some technicians had the idea of "the watch will be famous, and the person will also be famous," focusing on fame and fortune, and conflicts often occurred between them, hindering the progress of the trial production work. The leadership was afraid that they would quit, so they dared not criticize them, but only mediated the conflicts, resulting in more and more conflicts. The technicians put "I" first, and after two years of trial production, they still had not succeeded. This year, they wanted to trial-produce ladies' watches with about the same difficulty as the date watches. They learned from past lessons and assigned the task to the masses. Before the trial production plan was formulated, they studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction" with the workers and technicians. The workers participating in the trial production put "public" first, thinking of revolution in their hearts, daring to explore and create, and overcoming many difficulties with concerted efforts. In just twenty-one days, they successfully trial-produced the watches.

    Armed with Chairman Mao's great thought that the lowly are the most intelligent and the noble are the most foolish, the broad masses of workers challenged the so-called "experts" and "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, vigorously broke down "foreign dogmas" and "foreign frameworks," dared to explore and create, and quickly climbed many technical peaks, catching up with and surpassing advanced scientific and technological levels. This is another feature of the current new high tide in Shanghai's industrial production. In the first five months of this year, the number and level of major new products urgently needed for the development of new industries in the country that workers successfully trial-produced were rare in previous years. New alloy materials for manufacturing cutting-edge products, Dabang plastics that do not deform or discolor at high temperatures of 150 degrees Celsius, ultra-high-speed switching tubes with the fastest switching time of 3 to 10 nanoseconds, thermal analysis balances that can measure slight changes in materials at high temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius, and high-precision large gear grinding machines, etc., have all been manufactured by the workers through self-reliance.

    The trial production process of many new products is a process of fierce struggle between the two ideologies and two methods of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The amateur worker designers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant recently successfully designed two new machine tools with higher precision, fewer parts, lower cost, and easy manufacturing and maintenance. One of the machine tools has an electrical box with very complex electronic circuits inside, which was originally copied from abroad and was very inconvenient to use. The workers decided to change it. They started by asking an "expert" to design it. The "expert's" design was even more complex than the original, and he even said: "This design can be entered into the Leipzig Fair!" The amateur worker designers said: We are not doing design to be exhibited in Leipzig, but for socialism! They analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of various electronic circuits and studied the opinions of the user units, and drew up a draft. The "expert" again criticized and said: "A hodgepodge, a monstrosity!" The workers firmly believed that practice produces science, and after more than forty experiments, they finally designed a more ideal electronic circuit. The workers said: All bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" rely on "foreign books" and "foreign frameworks" to scare people, and we will eliminate their prestige, eradicate the bourgeois black line in the field of science and technology, and insert the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    In the struggle to catch up with the world's advanced level, the workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Textile Rolling Bearing Factory used Mao Zedong Thought to identify all foreign advanced technologies and advanced designs, and in a very short period of time, they created a separate high-speed spindle. This spindle can improve spinning efficiency. The workers of this factory boldly proposed a new type of structural solution based on practical experience, but it was opposed by foreign experts from the two countries with the fastest development of high-speed spindle industry in the world. They cited classics and confirmed that this plan would fail. The workers followed Chairman Mao's teachings and analyzed foreign technology from the perspective of class analysis, believing that foreign designs served the purpose of making money for capitalists, and could not be repaired during normal times. If any small part broke, the entire spindle had to be replaced. They also used Chairman Mao's "Two Essays" as weapons, comparing foreign technology with their own plans, and affirmed that the Chinese-style design from practice was more in line with dialectics. Therefore, they firmly took their own path and quickly caught up with the world's advanced level.

    Increased production in many factories in Shanghai was achieved by constantly breaking down metaphysics and vigorously promoting revolutionary philosophy. At the beginning of the year, in response to the idea that "production has reached its peak" and "there is little potential," workers in many factories conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's works such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" Vigorously break down static views, vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, and dig out new potential. By the end of April, a total of more than 28,000 key technical innovation and technical revolution projects had been realized in the city this year. The realization of some innovation projects has promoted fundamental changes in the production and technical outlook of the entire industry. The chemical industry workers greatly invigorated their revolutionary spirit, carried out scientific experiments, and vigorously broke down cumbersome philosophy. In the past, the industry did "addition" to the technology, equipment, and factory buildings to increase production. Now it has changed to doing "subtraction" to achieve increased production with fewer people and less equipment. The more than 20 technological innovation projects that have been realized in this industry have freed up more than 20,000 square meters of space, about 6,000 square meters of factory buildings, and more than 480 sets of equipment.

    The broad masses of workers have universally practiced studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, learning a little and applying a little, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. A trishaw worker team in Shanghai spent half a month of their spare time picking up a lot of scrap steel from the river. When they notified the steel factory to take it back, a cadre of the steel factory asked: "Who asked you to pick it up?" The workers answered loudly: "Quotations from Chairman Mao!" Once Mao Zedong Thought is mastered by the masses, it becomes a huge material force. With their own practical actions, the broad masses of workers have once again powerfully refuted the fallacies of those bourgeois "authorities" who slandered the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works as "pragmatism" and "vulgarization."

    At present, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai are fighting bravely on two major fronts, holding a pen in one hand and a hammer in the other. They firmly stated that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, completely defeat the rampant attacks of all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and completely seize the victory of the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution; in industrial production, they will forge ahead bravely and seize even greater victories.

    掀起空前广泛的大学毛主席著作新高潮
    上海突出政治促进职工队伍革命化
    大破“洋教条”、“洋框框”，敢闯敢创，在生产斗争中取得巨大胜利
    据新华社上海七日电　一直坚持高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的上海广大职工，今年在深入开展社会主义教育运动的基础上，掀起了空前广泛的大学毛主席著作新高潮，精神面貌起了显著变化。在当前无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，广大职工思想进一步大解放，革命精神进一步大发扬，阶级觉悟更加提高，在生产斗争中意气风发，夺取了一个又一个巨大胜利。
    当前，上海工业战线呈现出一派兴旺景象。今年前五个月，全市工业总产值比去年同期有较大幅度增长；生产稳定上升，特别是国家急需的重要产品钢、钢材、金属切削机床、化肥、农药、汽车、拖拉机、晶体管、棉纱等，都有较大的增产，有的产量成倍增长；产品质量稳定提高，并且试制成功一批具有六十年代水平的新产品。煤炭、木材、金属材料和化工原料消耗，都有下降；与去年同期相比，可比产品成本降低，上缴给国家的利润增加。群众性的技术革新、技术革命活动十分活跃。
    所有这一切都表明，在我国第三个五年计划的第一年，上海这个我国重要的工业基地，工业生产正以坚实的步伐，阔步前进。
    精神变物质。上海工业生产新高潮，是突出政治、突出毛泽东思想、促进职工队伍革命化的结果。今年，冶金、仪表、化工、轻工以及手工等各行各业的增产，一不是靠增加设备，二没有搞基本建设，就是靠毛泽东思想，靠职工群众的觉悟。这再次显示了一个伟大的真理：在生产斗争中，起决定作用的是人；用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最强大的生产力，什么困难都能克服，什么高峰都能攀登，什么奇迹都能创造。
    许多工厂在一切工作中坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持用毛泽东思想武装职工的头脑，在实现人的革命化的过程中，首先抓领导干部的革命化，把政治思想工作放在一切工作的首位，这是当前工业生产新高潮的一个鲜明的特色。
    在今年的工业生产新高潮中，上海许多厂职工，大学解放军、大学大庆、大学焦裕禄，加快了革命化的步伐；特别是许多厂的领导干部，还对照焦裕禄，进一步改造思想，改进作风，深入基层，和群众滚在一起。他们把企业不单看作是搞生产的阵地，更看作是进行兴无灭资斗争的阵地。在全市许多工厂广泛开展的政治和业务关系大讨论中，职工们批判了一切重业务、轻政治，政治与业务并重等形形色色错误观点。“毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做”，成为广大职工自觉的行动准则。通过大讨论，职工们更加坚定地认识到，生产靠人，人靠思想，有了毛泽东思想，人就能变得最聪明，最勇敢。他们说，是不是听毛主席的话，是不是照毛主席指引的方向前进，是不是把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，这是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路，是革命还是反革命的分水岭。
    突出政治，依靠群众，什么事情都好办，许多厂都越来越自觉地这样来领导生产。上海国棉二厂为提高“的确凉”的质量，曾经弄过上百条技术措施，成效都不大。后来领导向群众交底，在现场召开座谈会，倾听第一线生产工人的意见。工人们学习了毛主席著作，认识到提高产品质量，实质上是全心全意为人民服务的问题。他们以完全、彻底为人民服务的思想对待产品质量，几天工夫，就把老大难的“大山”搬掉了。
    上海手表厂领导通过前后两次试制手表的过程，深刻地体会到：思想过得硬，才能打硬仗，才能攻下“高、精、尖”。以前试制自动日历表，他们把任务交给几个技术好的人去干，就技术抓技术。技术人员中有“表出名、人也出名”的思想，计较名利，相互之间经常发生矛盾，阻碍试制工作的进行。领导上唯恐他们甩手不干，不敢批评，只是调和矛盾，结果矛盾越来越多。技术人员“我”字当头，试制了两年，还没有成功。今年，又要试制同日历手表难度差不多的女式手表，他们吸取了过去的教训，把任务交给群众，试制方案制定前，和工人、技术人员一起学《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》等。参加试制的职工“公”字当头，心里想的是革命，敢闯敢干，同心协力克服了不少困难，仅仅二十一天，就试制成功了。
    广大职工以毛主席的卑贱者最聪明、高贵者最愚蠢的伟大思想为武器，向资产阶级的所谓“专家”、“权威”挑战，大破“洋教条”、“洋框框”，敢闯敢创，迅速攀上了许多技术高峰，赶上并超过先进的科学技术水平。这是上海当前工业生产新高潮的又一特色。今年头五个月内，职工们试制成功的国家发展新型工业所迫切需要的重大新产品，数量之多，水平之高，为历年所少见。制造尖端产品用的新型合金材料，在摄氏一百五十度高温下不变形、不变色的达帮塑料，最快开关时间为三至十毫微秒的超高速开关管，可以在一千度高温下测量材料轻微变化的热分析天平，以及高精度大型齿轮磨造机，等等，职工们都自力更生地制造出来了。
    许多新产品的试制过程，就是无产阶级和资产阶级两种思想、两种方法激烈斗争的过程。上海机床厂的工人业余设计员，前不久设计成功两台精度较高、零件少、成本低、制造维修方便的新机床，其中一台机床上有只电箱，里面电子线路很复杂，原是仿造外国的，使用很不方便。工人们决心改掉。开始请了一位“专家”来设计。“专家”设计的比原来更复杂，还说：“这个设计可以上来比锡博览会！”工人业余设计员说：我们搞设计不是为了上来比锡，是为了社会主义！他们分析了各种电子线路的优缺点，研究了使用单位的意见，画出了草图。“专家”又非难说：“东拼西凑，四不象！”工人们坚信实践出科学，又经过四十多次的试验，终于设计出一种比较理想的电子线路。工人们说：一切资产阶级“专家”、“权威”就是靠“洋本本”、“洋框框”吓唬人，我们就要灭掉他们的威风，在科学技术领域中，拔掉资产阶级黑线，插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    上海第一纺织滚动轴承厂工人在赶超世界先进水平的斗争中，用毛泽东思想鉴别国外的一切先进技术、先进设计，在很短时间内，创制成功分离式高速锭子。这种锭子可以提高纺纱效率。这个厂的职工根据实践经验，大胆提出了一种新型的结构方案，却遭到国际上两个高速锭子工业发展最快的国家的洋专家的反对。他们引经据典，肯定这种方案要失败。工人们遵照毛主席的教导，用阶级分析的观点，分析了外国的技术，认为国外设计是为资本家赚钱服务的，平时不能维修，坏了任何一个小零件，都要把整个锭子换下来。他们又以毛主席的“两论”为武器，对比了外国的技术和自己的方案，肯定来自实践的中国式的设计更符合辩证法。于是，坚定地走自己的路，迅速赶上了世界先进水平。
    上海许多工厂增产是在不断大破形而上学、大兴革命哲学的情况下实现的。年初，许多厂职工针对“增产到顶”、“潜力不大”等见物不见人的思想，认真学习毛主席的《矛盾论》《实践论》《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》等著作，大破静止观点，大力开展技术革新、技术革命，挖出了新的潜力。到四月底为止，今年全市实现的重点技术革新、技术革命项目共有两万八千多项。有些革新项目的实现，促使整个行业生产技术面貌发生根本变化。化工行业职工大振革命精神，大搞科学实验，大破烦琐哲学。过去这个行业搞增产，工艺、设备、厂房都要做
  “加法”，现在改为做“减法”，实现了增产减人、减设备。这个行业已经实现的二十多个工艺革新项目，就可腾出场地二万多平方米，厂房六千平方米左右，设备四百八十多台。
    广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，按照毛主席的指示办事，已成了普遍的行动。上海有个三轮车工人小组，花了半个月业余时间，从河浜里拣了许多废钢铁。他们通知钢厂去取回时，钢厂的一个干部问：“谁叫你们拣的？”工人响亮地回答：“毛主席语录！”毛主席思想一旦为群众掌握，就成为巨大的物质力量。广大职工以自己的实际行动，再一次有力地回击了那些资产阶级“权威”污蔑活学活用毛主席著作是“实用主义”、“庸俗化”的谬论。
    当前，上海广大职工正一手拿笔，一手拿榔头，在两条大的战线上奋勇作战。他们坚决表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底打垮一切反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻，彻底夺取社会主义文化大革命的胜利；在工业生产中，奋勇直前，夺取更大的胜利。
