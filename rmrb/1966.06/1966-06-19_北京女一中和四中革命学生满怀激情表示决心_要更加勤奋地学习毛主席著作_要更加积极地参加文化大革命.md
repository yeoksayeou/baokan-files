    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th – Revolutionary students from Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School, who initiated the abolition of the old college entrance examination system, and Beijing No. 4 Middle School, who were the first to respond to this initiative, are filled with extraordinary excitement as they hail the decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the reform of the college entrance examination method. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, charge into the battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, become revolutionary vanguards of the Mao Zedong era, and thoroughly carry out the revolution.

    Last night, when the Central People's Broadcasting Station first broadcast the decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, these two schools immediately erupted in jubilation. The vast numbers of revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!" "Resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Students spread the news, saying, "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao support us!" Many were so happy that they shed tears and excitedly sang songs such as "Chairman Mao, the Sun in Our Hearts." At the same time, university and middle school students from other schools and other places called and telegraphed one after another, congratulating them on their revolutionary initiative being supported by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Students from universities and middle schools such as Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Second Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University delivered big-character posters overnight. Student representatives from Yongledian Middle School in Tongxian County, more than a hundred miles from downtown Beijing, rode bicycles all night with big-character posters to congratulate the No. 1 Girls' Middle School. Students from Zhengzhou No. 11 Middle School in Henan Province delivered the written big-character posters to the railway station overnight, entrusting a People's Liberation Army comrade taking the night train to bring them to Beijing. As soon as he got off the train, he delivered the big-character posters to the school. A parent of a No. 4 Middle School student in Fularji, Heilongjiang Province, said in a telegram: "My child is a graduating senior from your school. I firmly request that you approve his going to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the storms of class struggle, to be tempered into a true successor to the proletarian revolution." Many students in these two schools stayed up all night, receiving batches of congratulators and visitors. As of 6:00 PM today, the two schools have received more than seventy telegrams and hundreds of big-character posters.

    The support from brother schools and people's congratulations have further strengthened the fighting spirit and determination of the revolutionary students. Today, the two schools held school-wide rallies and various symposiums respectively. Many students delivered enthusiastic speeches at the meetings, resolutely supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Many people listed a large number of facts, condemning the old college entrance examination methods as violating Chairman Mao's educational policy. They said that bourgeois representatives used this as a weapon to carry out class struggle against the proletariat, to exercise dictatorship over the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. It has become a stumbling block to socialist education and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and must be completely destroyed.

    The students of Class Four, Senior Three of the No. 1 Girls' Middle School, who drafted the initiative, said: The old college entrance examination method actually puts scores in command, does not highlight politics, encourages students to cram books and memorize dogmas, and follow the bourgeois "individual struggle" and the white and expert road of pursuing personal fame and fortune. It cannot comprehensively implement the Party's education policy at all. Students of Class Five, Senior Three of the No. 4 Middle School, revealed that among the graduates of the school last year, one student wrote reactionary poems while working in the countryside, opposing the Party and socialism. When applying for university, he was admitted simply because his score was high. Many students from worker and peasant families with consistently good ideological performance but slightly lower entrance examination scores were excluded from universities.

    They said that the old college entrance examination method not only made senior high school students feel a heavy burden, but also became a heavy mental pressure on junior high school students. Some students started preparing lessons from the second grade in order to get into university. Some did not care about politics in order to get high scores. A student in Class One, Senior Two of the No. 4 Middle School, wrote in his diary: "I am not a political cadre, I do not engage in politics. If I engage in politics, it will affect my study time. I am willing to write gold words in the world's encyclopedia like Mendeleev (Russian scientist)."

    Many students pointed out that under the constraints of the old examination system, "studying for the revolution" actually became empty talk. Even taking political class was just memorizing articles instead of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. At the symposium, they demanded that participating in class struggle be regarded as the main course, and all high school graduates should first go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to be tempered, and obtain the "ideological graduation certificate" given by the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the three major revolutionary movements. They said that reforming the college entrance examination system is just opening up a breakthrough in destroying the bourgeois education line. In the future, we must start from here, carry out a thorough revolution in the entire old education system, smash all old systems, smash all foreign and old frameworks that hinder our revolutionization and restrict our lively, active, and initiative learning, and become critics of the old world.

    The students are determined to study Chairman Mao's writings more diligently and participate more actively in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said, we are the new generation of revolution, we infinitely love Chairman Mao, and infinitely believe in and worship Mao Zedong Thought. It is our greatest responsibility to take over and pass on the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to join revolutionary teachers and students across the country in seizing all educational positions in this Cultural Revolution, turning all schools across the country into anti-Japanese military and political universities, and turning them into revolutionary furnaces of the proletariat, so that generations of young people will become strong successors to the proletarian revolution and will never degenerate for thousands of generations.

    北京女一中和四中革命学生满怀激情表示决心
    要更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作  要更加积极地参加文化大革命
    新华社十八日讯　倡议废除旧的升学考试制度的北京市第一女子中学和最早响应这个倡议的北京市第四中学的革命学生们，怀着特别激动的心情，欢呼中共中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，做毛泽东时代的革命闯将，彻底闹革命。
    昨晚，当中央人民广播电台第一次广播中共中央和国务院的决定时，这两个学校立即欢腾起来，广大革命师生热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“拥护党中央、毛主席的英明决定！”“坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”同学们奔走相告：“党中央、毛主席支持我们啦！”许多人高兴得流下了眼泪，兴奋地唱起了《毛主席，我们心中的太阳》等歌曲。与此同时，外校、外地的大中学生也纷纷打来电话和电报，祝贺他们的革命倡议得到党中央和毛主席的支持。北京大学、北京师范大学、北师大第二附属中学等大中学校的学生，连夜送来了大字报。离北京市区一百多里地的通县永乐店中学的学生代表，带着大字报，骑了一夜自行车，赶到第一女中祝贺。河南省郑州市第十一中学的学生，把写好的大字报连夜送到火车站，托一位乘夜车的解放军同志带到北京，他一下火车就把大字报送到了学校。远在黑龙江省富拉尔基的一位第四中学学生的家长在电报中说：“我的孩子是你校高三应届毕业生，我坚决要求你们批准他到工农兵群众中去，到阶级斗争的风浪中去，锻炼成为真正的无产阶级革命接班人。”这两个学校的许多学生彻夜未眠，接待一批又一批的祝贺者和来访者。到今天下午六时止，两个学校已收到七十多封电报和几百张大字报。
    兄弟学校的支持和人们的祝贺，更加坚定了革命学生们的斗志和决心。今天，这两个学校分别举行了全校大会和各种座谈会。许多学生在会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话，坚决拥护党中央和国务院的决定。很多人列举大量事实，控诉旧的高等学校考试办法是违反毛主席教育方针的，是资产阶级代表人物以此为武器，来同无产阶级进行阶级斗争，来对工人、贫下中农子女实行专政，它已经成为社会主义教育事业和无产阶级文化大革命的绊脚石，必须彻底摧毁。
    起草倡议书的第一女中高三（四）班的同学说：旧的高等学校入学考试方法，实际上是分数挂帅，不是突出政治，是鼓励学生死钻书本，死背教条，走资产阶级“个人奋斗”、追逐个人名利地位的白专道路，根本不能全面贯彻党的教育方针。第四中学高三（五）班的学生揭发该校上一届毕业生中，有一个同学下乡劳动时写反动诗，反党反社会主义，考大学时，仅仅因为他分数高就被录取。许多思想一贯好，而入学考试成绩稍差的工农家庭出身的学生，却被排除在高等学校门外。
    他们说，旧的高等学校招考办法，不仅使高中三年级学生感到是沉重的负担，而且也成为高中二年级学生沉重的精神压力。有的学生为了考上大学，从二年级起就开始准备功课。有的为了争取高分数，不关心政治。第四中学高二（一）班有个学生在日记中写道：“我不是政治干部，我不搞政治。我要是搞政治，就会影响学习时间。我愿向门捷列夫（俄国科学家）一样，在世界的百科全书中写上金字。”
    许多学生指出，在旧的考试制度束缚下，“为革命学习”实际上成为一句空话，考政治课也只是死背条文，而不是活学活用毛泽东思想。在座谈会上，他们要求把参加阶级斗争作为主课，所有的高中毕业生都应当先到工农兵中去锻炼，在三大革命运动中去取得工农兵群众给予的“思想毕业证书”。他们说，改革高等学校入学考试制度，只是打开了摧毁资产阶级教育路线的一个突破口，将来还要从这里着手，对整个旧的教育制度实行彻底的革命，砸烂一切旧制度，砸烂一切阻碍我们革命化、束缚我们生动、活泼、主动学习的洋框框、旧框框，作一个旧世界的批判者。
    学生们决心更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作，更加积极地参加无产阶级文化大革命。他们说，我们是革命的新一代，我们无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰、无限崇拜毛泽东思想。把毛泽东思想伟大红旗接过来、传下去，是我们最大的责任。他们决心同全国革命师生一起，在这场文化大革命中把所有的教育阵地都夺过来，把全国的学校都办成抗大式的学校，办成无产阶级的革命大熔炉，让一代一代的青年人都成为坚强的无产阶级革命接班人，千代、万代永不变质。
