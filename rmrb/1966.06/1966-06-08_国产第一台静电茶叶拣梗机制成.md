    The first domestically produced electrostatic tea stem-sorting machine has recently been successfully trial-produced with the collaboration of the Hangzhou Tea Factory and relevant departments.
    This electrostatic tea stem-sorting machine is capable of sorting out old stems, tender veins, and non-tea admixtures such as grains and wheat. The quality of the tea sorting fully meets the current requirements of refined tea picking processes, and the operation is also relatively simple.
    China has a history of tea production spanning thousands of years. After liberation, through technical innovation, most of the processing procedures have been mechanized, but tea sorting is still done manually. Manual tea sorting is inefficient, costly, and of poor quality, taking more than one hundred hours to sort one *dan* (approximately 50 kg) of tea. In recent years, although efficiency has improved through technological innovation, tea sorting remains a weak link in production.
    With the development of the electrostatic tea stem-sorting machine, the Hangzhou Tea Factory can now mechanize the entire production process from crude tea to refined Chun Mee tea.
    This electrostatic tea stem-sorting machine has already begun trial production by the Hangzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory.

    国产第一台静电茶叶拣梗机制成
    国产第一台静电茶叶拣梗机，最近在杭州茶厂和有关部门的协作下试制成功。
    这台静电茶叶拣梗机，能够拣出老梗、嫩筋和谷子、麦子等非茶类夹杂物。拣茶质量完全符合当前茶叶精制拣剔工艺的要求，操作也比较简便。
    我国茶叶生产已有几千年历史。解放后经过技术革新，大部分加工工序都用上了机器，但是拣茶仍然是手工操作。手工操作拣茶效率低、费用大、质量差，拣一担茶叶要花一百多个小时。近几年来经过技术革新，效率虽有所提高，但拣茶仍然是生产上的一个薄弱环节。
    由于制成了静电茶叶拣梗机，目前杭州茶厂从毛茶精制成眉茶，全部生产过程都用上了机器。
    这种静电茶叶拣梗机，已由杭州农业机械厂开始试生产。
