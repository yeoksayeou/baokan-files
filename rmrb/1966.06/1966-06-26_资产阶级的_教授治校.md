The bourgeois "professor governance" of schools

The counter-revolutionary element Kuāng Yǎmíng has his "four firsts": first in scientific research achievements; first as a "scholar" and "authority"; first in academic performance; first in material conditions. These "four firsts" reflect his revisionist ideology.

Kuāng Yǎmíng, this representative of the bourgeoisie, upon entering Nanjing University, first thing he did was to visit bourgeois professors and scholars, eager to know if they were "fully utilized." A few days later, in his first speech at a full-school meeting, he said that in a modern university like Nanjing University, there were still thatched classrooms, and the conditions were really poor. He proposed a grand basic construction plan.

Kuāng Yǎmíng said that the quality of a higher education institution is measured by whether it has a high-level academic journal, whether it has many famous "scholars" and "authorities," and whether it has new and cutting-edge scientific research achievements. To improve the level of the academic journal and to produce more "scientific research achievements," he significantly increased the manuscript fee for the journal. He emphasized the heavy burden of scientific research tasks, saying that professional scientific researchers could not participate in physical labor, could not participate in urban and rural socialist education movements, and could even not participate in political study. He strongly promoted bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities," and in every way expanded the power of the academic journal editorial board. This is essentially a challenge to the Party's leadership in schools, a reincarnation of bourgeois "professor governance."

He actively cultivated revisionist successors among the students, showing special concern for those "high-score" students (those with an average of over 90 in the entrance exam, regardless of political conditions). In 1963, soon after the students entered the university, he held a "high-score" student meeting, calling on them to strive individually, study hard, achieve fame and fortune, and maliciously distorting the Party's policy of emphasizing performance. At the end of 1965, he again convened a "high-score" student meeting, further instilling revisionist ideology.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." All revolutionary comrades, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary element Kuāng Yǎmíng's implementation of the revisionist educational line against Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly settle the accounts of Kuāng Yǎmíng's "four firsts" and their poisonous influence. Let us welcome the birth of a truly socialist new Nanjing University. Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    资产阶级的“教授治校”
    反党分子匡亚明有“四个第一”：科学研究成果第一；“学者”“权威”第一；学习成绩第一；物质条件第一。这“四个第一”，反映了他的修正主义思想。
    匡亚明这个资产阶级代表人物，一进南京大学，第一件大事就是登门拜访资产阶级教授、学者，急于了解他们有没有“充分发挥作用”。几天以后，他第一次在全校大会上，就说什么在南大这样现代的大学中，竟还有草房课堂，条件实在太差，提出了一个庞大的基本建设计划。
    匡亚明说，衡量一个高等学校的好坏，就看这个学校有没有一个高水平的学报，有没有许多出名的“学者”、“权威”，有没有又新又尖的科学研究成果。他为了提高学报水平，为了多出“科学研究成果”，大大提高学报的稿费标准。他强调科学研究任务重，竟说专业科学研究人员平时可以不参加体力劳动，可以不参加城乡社会主义教育运动，甚至可以不参加政治学习。他极力吹捧资产阶级“学者”、“权威”，千方百计地扩大学报委员会的权力。这实质上是反对党在学校中的领导作用，是资产阶级的“教授治校”的翻版。
    他在学生中大力培养修正主义的接班人，对那些“高分”学生（入学考试成绩平均九十分以上，不问政治条件）特别关心。一九六三年，学生刚进大学校门，他就召开了“高分”学生座谈会，号召他们个人奋斗，用功苦读，成名成家，并恶毒地歪曲党的重在表现的阶级政策。一九六五年底，他又再次召集“高分”学生座谈，进一步灌输修正主义思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。一切革命的同志们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中，彻底揭露批判反党反社会主义分子匡亚明所执行的反毛泽东思想的修正主义教育路线，彻底清算匡亚明的“四个第一”及其流毒。让我们欢呼真正的社会主义的新南京大学的诞生。无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
