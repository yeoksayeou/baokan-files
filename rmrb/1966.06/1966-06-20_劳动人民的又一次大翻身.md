    Another Great Overturn for the Laboring People
    Retired Red Army veterans Que Ming and Mi Xiuying said after hearing the Central Committee's notice on reforming the higher education enrollment examination system, "Chairman Mao has led us to seize back another great seal of power. This is a great joyous event for our proletariat and another great new victory for Mao Zedong Thought." We raise both hands in support of this decision, a thousand times in support, ten thousand times in support!
    On the day the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced the decision to reform the higher education enrollment examination system, the reporter interviewed retired Red Army veterans Que Ming and Mi Xiuying of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The two veterans said with extreme excitement: "This decision is a thousand times good, ten thousand times good! Last night, as soon as we finished listening to the broadcast, we discussed it with our children and said, 'Chairman Mao has led us to seize back another great seal of power. This is a great joyous event for our proletariat and another great new victory for Mao Zedong Thought.'"
    Que Ming joined the Central Red Army led by Chairman Mao in Caixi Township, Shanghang County, Fujian Province, in the old revolutionary base area in 1930. Decades of struggle have given him unlimited faith and love for Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "In the past, children buried themselves in books all day long, and when it came to college entrance exams, they became obsessed, getting up early and working late. I saw it and thought to myself: I, a rough old fellow, mainly studied Mao Zedong Thought as my main course at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. My mind was filled with two big words—revolution—and I followed Chairman Mao wholeheartedly in making revolution. Now children spend all day buried in books, filling their minds with scores, college entrance, and the future. I worry about whether Mao Zedong Thought can be passed on from generation to generation." Therefore, he often organized his children to study Chairman Mao's works, and strictly maintained a hard-working and simple lifestyle to give them "political supplementary lessons." However, whenever he thought of this major issue related to the success or failure of the communist cause, he could not rest easy. The Party Central Committee and the State Council, based on Chairman Mao's instructions, made the wise decision to reform the higher education enrollment system in order to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution and thoroughly reform the education system. The *People's Daily* published a special editorial, which was truly satisfying and greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat. This decision cut off the counter-revolutionary black hands of the bourgeoisie who try to lead youth down the road of becoming bourgeois intellectuals with no political consciousness, smashed their base for cultivating bourgeois successors, tore up their filthy textbooks, made Mao Zedong's works a compulsory course, and implemented the educational line of highlighting proletarian politics. This is a major event to ensure that China's younger generation will never change color, and it is an event related to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution."
    Mi Xiuying then raised a thought-provoking question: "In the past, why did the children of the bourgeoisie, landlords, and rich peasants get into college more often, while the children of the laboring people got in less often? Were their children naturally smart and willing to work hard, while our laboring people's children were born stupid and unwilling to work hard?" This female soldier, who begged for food and worked as a child bride and joined the Red Army in 1933, said indignantly: "Absolutely not! Listen to the words and watch the actions. These bourgeois 'authority' masters were born with black hearts. They used the old college entrance examination system to pave the way for the filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the reactionary classes and cultivate successors for their restoration of capitalism in China. They fiercely carried out the dictatorship against our proletariat, workers, and peasants’ children. Now Chairman Mao is leading us to expose their black hearts, and we must advance victoriously, smash all the old systems that serve the reactionary classes, seize back the power of education, and carry out the Great Cultural Revolution to the end."
    Mi Xiuying also told the reporter that her eldest daughter, Que Lihua, was born in the most difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War. Due to frequent battles, she had to be fostered in a poor peasant's home. The hard life caused Lihua to suffer from malnutrition. After liberation, the Party sent Lihua to the hospital to cure her illness and provided her with education. However, when she was in the second year of high school, because she transferred schools, her foreign language textbook changed, and she couldn't keep up for a while. The school even used "poor development," "too short," and "in the future, not meeting the conditions for applying to college" as excuses to discriminate against and make things difficult for her, and finally forced her to drop out of school. Lihua later participated in labor in a neighborhood production team and was an active member in studying Chairman Mao's works. When the Party proposed supporting agriculture, she was the first to sign up. Such a bitter child who listened to Chairman Mao the most became the object of suppression by bourgeois "authorities." However, the children of a high-level intellectual who was an engineer all entered college. Some didn't pass the exam the first year, but relying on their good family conditions, they desperately reviewed their lessons and passed the exam the second year. However, they ignored the Party's call for educated youth to go to the countryside to build a new socialist countryside. Mi Xiuying said: "The bourgeois elements who have infiltrated the education field are relying on the old college entrance examination system to carry out dictatorship against us, trying their best to resist the policy put forward by Chairman Mao that education should serve proletarian politics and combine education with productive labor. Isn't it clear who they are close to and who they hate!" This wise decision made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is another great overturn and great liberation for the laboring people.
    At this time, Que Ming said angrily: "My father worked as a long-term worker for the landlord for decades, and no one in my family for generations could read. When I was seven years old, my father led me to the landlord's house to plead for me to study in a private school. The landlord glared at me and said, 'No, the school gate is not open to poor ghosts.'" Now that we have seized the seal of power, these jackals in communist party members’ clothing are waving "red flags" but stabbing us in the back in secret. We must rely on the magic weapon of the proletarian dictatorship to sweep them all away, so that the proletariat and the laboring people can take back all cultural positions and truly become the masters of culture.
    The two veteran Red Army fighters repeatedly stated: "Our parents are dear, but not as dear as the Party and Chairman Mao. This Great Cultural Revolution personally led by Chairman Mao will thoroughly eradicate the poisonous roots that produce revisionism and bring benefits to the proletariat, the laboring people, and the revolutionary people of the world. We raise both hands in support of the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to thoroughly reform the higher education enrollment system according to Chairman Mao's instructions, a thousand times in support, ten thousand times in support!"

    劳动人民的又一次大翻身
    退休老红军阙明、米秀英夫妇，听到中央改革高等学校招生考试办法通知后说，毛主席又领导咱们夺回一个大印把子，这是咱无产阶级一桩大喜事，是毛泽东思想又一个伟大的新胜利。对中央这个决定，我们举双手赞成，一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
    中共中央、国务院决定改革高等学校招生考试办法的通知公布的当天，记者访问了中国人民解放军沈阳部队退休老红军阙明、米秀英夫妇。两位老红军极为兴奋地说：这个决定一千个好，一万个好！昨晚我们一听完广播，就和孩子们一起议论说，毛主席又领导咱们夺回一个大印把子，这是咱无产阶级一桩大喜事，是毛泽东思想又一个伟大的新胜利。
    阙明是一九三○年在革命老根据地福建省上杭县才溪乡参加毛主席领导的中央红军的。几十年的斗争实践，使他对毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限热爱。他说，过去孩子们成天埋头读书，一到升学考试，更是起早贪黑象着了迷一样，我看在眼里，想在心里：我这个大老粗，在抗日军政大学学习时，主要就是学好毛泽东思想这一门课，脑子里装着两个大字——革命，一个心眼跟着毛主席闹革命。现在孩子们整天钻在书堆里，脑子里装的是分数、升学和前途，我担心毛泽东思想能不能一代一代传下去。于是，就经常组织孩子们学习毛主席著作，生活上也严格保持艰苦朴素，就这样给他们进行“政治补课”。可是，每当想到这个关系到共产主义事业成败的大事，心总是放不下来。党中央、国务院根据毛主席指示，为了彻底搞好文化革命、彻底改革教育制度，作出了改革高等学校招考制度的英明决定，《人民日报》专门发了社论，真是大快人心，大长无产阶级志气。这个决定，斩断了资产阶级反动势力引诱青年走白专道路的反党反社会主义黑手，砸碎了他们培养资产阶级接班人的阵地，撕毁了他们那乌七八糟的教材，把毛主席著作当必修课，贯彻突出无产阶级政治的教育路线，这是一件保证中国青年一代永不变色的大事，是关系到中国革命和世界革命的大事。
    米秀英接着提出了一个发人深思的问题：过去，为什么资产阶级、地主、富农的子女升学的多，劳动人民的子女升学的少？是他们的子女天生聪明又肯用功，我们劳动人民的子女生来就愚笨又不用功吗？这个从小讨饭、当童养媳，一九三三年参加红军的女战士，激愤地说：决不是这样！听话听音，看人看心，这些资产阶级“权威”老爷们生就了一颗黑心。他们用旧的升学考试制度，为反动阶级的孝子贤孙铺路搭桥，为他们培养在中国复辟资本主义的接班人。恶狠狠地专我们无产阶级、工农子弟的政。现在毛主席领导我们扒开了他们的黑心，我们一定要乘胜前进，砸碎一切为反动阶级服务的旧制度，夺回教育大权，把文化大革命进行到底。
    米秀英还对记者说：她的大女儿阙利华出生在抗日战争最艰苦的年代，由于频繁的战斗，只好把她寄养在一户贫农家里，艰苦的生活，使利华患了营养不良症。解放后，党送利华到医院治好了病，又供她读书，可是读到高中二年的时候，因为转学，外语课本变了，一时跟不上，学校竟以“发育不良”，“个子太小”，“将来不符合报考大学的条件”作借口，加以歧视和刁难，最后终于迫她退了学。利华后来在街道生产组参加劳动，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。党提出支援农业，她第一个报了名。象这样最听毛主席的话的苦孩子，成了资产阶级“权威”压制的对象。可是，另一家当工程师的高级知识分子的几个孩子都入了大学，有的头年没考上，仗着家里条件好，拼命复习功课，第二年又考上了。而党号召知识青年下乡建设社会主义新农村，他们却不理睬。米秀英说：钻进教育界的资产阶级分子，凭着旧的升学考试制度向我们专政，千方百计与毛主席提出的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针对抗。他们对谁亲，对谁恨，不是明明白白的摆着吗！党中央和毛主席作出的这个英明决定，是劳动人民又一次大翻身，大解放。
    这时，阙明气愤地说：我父亲给地主扛了几十年长工，家里几辈人没个识字的，我七岁那年，父亲领我到地主家求情读私塾，地主狗眼一瞪说：“不行，学堂门不是给穷鬼开的。”现在我们掌握了印把子，这些披着共产党员外衣的豺狼，手里摇着“红旗”，暗地里却向我们捅刀子。我们要靠无产阶级专政的法宝，把他们统统扫除干净，让无产阶级、劳动人民夺回一切文化阵地，真正成为文化的主人。
    两位老红军战士最后一再表示：爹亲娘亲，比不上党和毛主席亲。毛主席亲自领导的这场文化大革命，彻底挖掉产生修正主义的毒根，造福于无产阶级、劳动人民，造福于全世界革命人民。党中央、国务院根据毛主席指示彻底改革高等学校招考制度的决定，我们举双手赞成，一千个拥护，一万个拥护！
