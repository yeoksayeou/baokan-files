    Expose the Sinister Intentions of "Authorities"
    Li Furong
    Recently, the newspaper republished Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article "Arming Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought," written in 1960. This is a good article about creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. However, such a good article was criticized by some so-called "authorities" as a typical example of "vulgarization" and "simplification," and they even forbade us from applying Mao Zedong Thought to playing table tennis. After seeing the materials exposed in the newspaper, I felt very indignant.
    I think Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article is very well written, capturing the growth process of our table tennis players. It tells us that to play table tennis for the revolution and win honor for the motherland, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our non-proletarian ideas, and then we can use Mao Zedong Thought to solve the various contradictions encountered in playing table tennis. This article sets a good example for us in studying Chairman Mao's works, expressing the strong desire of millions of revolutionary youths and the world's revolutionary people to master Mao Zedong Thought.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese revolution and the world revolution cannot do without it. It is the supreme instruction for all revolutionary work and a powerful ideological weapon for understanding and transforming the world.
    The Party constantly educates us that playing table tennis is also engaging in revolution. To engage in revolution, we must study and master Mao Zedong Thought, transform our thinking, and establish a proletarian world view. Only in this way can we do our work well and truly serve the world revolution.
    I have been involved in table tennis for more than eight years. I grew up under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Recalling the path I have taken, I deeply feel that if there is less Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, there will be more bourgeois individualism and more metaphysical things. Then, playing will suffer setbacks and affect my performance. If there is more Mao Zedong Thought in my mind and a little more revolutionary dialectics, I can fully utilize my skills during competitions, overcome all difficulties, and strive for good results. Therefore, as an athlete of New China, only by diligently reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can we achieve something, win glory for the motherland, and become a revolutionary successor.
    I have known Comrade Zhuang Jiafu for a long time. He accompanied us on overseas visits and competitions twice, serving as a coach. He is usually active and responsible in his work, enduring hardship and standing at the forefront. He also often used Mao Zedong Thought to enlighten us by combining it with our specific problems, which greatly helped us young athletes over the years.
    The reason he was able to write such a good article is by no means accidental. It is inseparable from his usual strict demands on himself, his efforts to transform his thinking, and his creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works.
    "Authority" gentlemen! I want to question you, where exactly is using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's thinking and guide work "vulgar"? Do you want us to use bourgeois ideology and metaphysical viewpoints to guide our work? Do you want us to blindly follow you to be considered not "vulgar"? To put it bluntly, you are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, afraid of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought and rising up to make revolution against you. Your accusations are not just against these two articles but have despicable political purposes. You are doing everything possible to resist and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, afraid that we will learn it and master it. You want to disarm us ideologically, make us lose our political direction, and allow you to manipulate us, so as to realize your capitalist restoration dreams. Let me tell you, this is wishful thinking! Your ambitions will never succeed.
    Now is the era when the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers master Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how concealed and cunning your methods are, you will eventually be seen through by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how you obstruct and oppose, you cannot stop the torrent of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, and you will surely be crushed by this torrent.
    "Authority" gentlemen! You will absolutely not succeed in preventing us from studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. The more you oppose it, the more it shows the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, and the more it proves that all demons and monsters in the world are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support. We want to tell these "authority" gentlemen! We are determined to learn Mao Zedong Thought. We must learn it well, truly master it, study it deeply and thoroughly, and study it for a lifetime. Whoever opposes workers, peasants, and soldiers learning Mao Zedong Thought opposes the revolution and is the enemy of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. We must resolutely struggle against them until we completely defeat them.

    揭穿“权威”的罪恶用心
    李富荣
    最近，报纸上重新登载了庄家富同志在一九六○年写的《用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑》的文章。这是一篇活学活用毛主席著作的好文章。但是，这样好的文章竟被某些所谓“权威”指责为“庸俗化”、“简单化”的典型，并且还不许我们把毛泽东思想用到打乒乓球上。我看到报上揭露的材料以后，感到非常气愤。
    我认为庄家富同志的文章写得很好，写出了我们乒乓球运动员成长的过程。他告诉我们要为革命打球，为祖国争取荣誉，必须用毛泽东思想改造自己的非无产阶级思想，然后才能运用毛泽东思想，去解决打乒乓球所碰到的各种矛盾。这篇文章为我们树立了学习毛主席著作的好榜样，写出了千千万万革命青年和世界革命人民要把毛泽东思想学到手的强烈愿望。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。中国革命和世界革命都离不了它，它是一切革命工作的最高指示，是认识世界和改造世界的强大思想武器。
    党不断教育我们，打乒乓球就是干革命。干革命就要学习和掌握毛泽东思想，改造自己的思想，树立无产阶级世界观。只有这样，才能把工作做好，真正地为世界革命服务。
    我从事乒乓球运动已有八年多的时间，我是在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。回忆我所走过的道路，我深深地感到，头脑里毛泽东思想少了，资产阶级个人主义就多了，形而上学的东西就多了，那么，打球就会受到挫折，影响比赛成绩。如果头脑里毛泽东思想多了一点，革命的辩证法多了一点，比赛的时候，就能充分发挥技术，去克服一切困难，去争取好的成绩。所以，作为一个新中国的运动员，只有努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，才能有所作为，为祖国争光，才能做一个革命的接班人。
    我和庄家富同志相处时间较长，他曾经两次和我们一起出国访问比赛，担任教练工作。他平时对待工作积极负责，任劳任怨，处处走在前头。并且经常用毛泽东思想结合我们的具体问题，来启发我们，对我们这些年青运动员帮助很大。
    他所以能够写出这样好的文章，决不是偶然的。这和他平时严格要求自己，努力改造思想，活学活用毛主席著作是分不开的。
    “权威”老爷们！我倒要质问你们，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，来指导工作，究竟“庸俗”在哪里？难道要我们用资产阶级思想，用形而上学的观点来指导工作？难道要我们糊里糊涂地跟着你们走才不算“庸俗”吗？说穿了，你们是害怕毛泽东思想，害怕我们广大工农兵群众掌握和运用毛泽东思想，起来革你们的命。你们的指责，不单单是指责这两篇文章，而是有卑鄙的政治目的。你们千方百计地抵制和反对毛泽东思想，害怕我们去学它、去掌握它。你们想在思想上解除我们的武装，使我们迷失政治方向，听任你们的摆布，以便实现你们的资本主义复辟的美梦。告诉你们，这是妄想！你们的野心永远也不会得逞。
    现在是广大工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想的时代。不管你们的手段怎么隐蔽、狡猾，最后终将被掌握了毛泽东思想的广大工农兵群众所识破。不管你们怎样阻挠和反对，你们也阻挡不住工农兵学习毛主席著作的洪流，而且一定会被这股洪流所冲垮。
    “权威”老爷们！你们反对我们学习和掌握毛泽东思想，是绝对办不到的。你们越是反对，就越显示出毛泽东思想的伟大，越加证明世界上一切牛鬼蛇神都害怕毛泽东思想。毛主席告诉我们：凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。我们要正告这些“权威”老爷们！我们学毛泽东思想是学定了，我们一定要把毛泽东思想学好，真正学到手，学深、学透，学一辈子。谁反对工农兵学习毛泽东思想，谁就是反对革命，谁就是中国人民和全世界革命人民的敌人。我们就要和他们坚决斗争，直到把他们彻底打垮为止。
