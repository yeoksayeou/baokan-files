    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 3rd. The Foreign Ministry of North Korea stated in a memorandum issued on the 1st that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people will wage a resolute struggle against the convening of the "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific" and to crush the new aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism that threaten the security of socialist countries and countries striving for national independence.

    This memorandum exposed the background and aggressive nature of the "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific," scheduled to be held in Seoul on June 14th under the direct manipulation of U.S. imperialism.

    The memorandum pointed out that the chief culprit in plotting this meeting is U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialists are attempting to gather their vassal states and puppets in Asia and the Pacific together politically, economically, and militarily, to form a single military bloc in order to complete their military strategic system for aggression against Asia.

    The memorandum pointed out that U.S. imperialism has been engaged in conspiracies to piece together a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" as a link in its strategic plan for aggression against the whole of Asia. They are trying to make Japanese militarism play a core role here. U.S. imperialism has also signed "mutual defense treaties" separately with the Philippines, the South Korean puppet clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. In this way, a foundation has been laid for gathering them into a multilateral military alliance system, and the process of rearmament of Japanese militarism has been rapidly promoted.

    The memorandum said: In order to gather Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan into a single anti-communist military bloc, it is first urgently required that "Japan-South Korea relations be normalized." Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the South Korean puppet clique and Japanese militarists concluded the "Japan-South Korea talks" in June 1965 and achieved "normalization" of "diplomatic relations." This is not only political and economic collusion between South Korea and Japan, but in essence, it is military collusion.

    After U.S. imperialism signed the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," it began even more frenzied actions to piece together a broad aggressive military bloc in accordance with its established policy. Especially after suffering an irreparable defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam, it has embarked on a more frenzied and adventurous path in order to piece together a new military alliance to deal with this situation.

    U.S. imperialism is currently piecing together an expanded military bloc including all the vassal states and puppets in Asia and the Pacific, attempting to use it to carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam and make it easier to carry out aggression against Asia. In order to escape the strong opposition and condemnation of the people of Asia and the world, U.S. imperialism is trying to instruct its follower countries to use "economic cooperation" to conceal the conspiracy to piece together an aggressive military bloc.

    The memorandum pointed out that Japan plays a "key" role in implementing U.S. imperialism's strategic plan to piece together an anti-communist military bloc, which is directly related to its aggressive ambitions. In order to conceal their aggressive purposes, Japanese militarists are clamoring that "economic and cultural cooperation" issues must also be discussed at the upcoming "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific."

    The Park Chung-hee clique, U.S. imperialism's most loyal lackey, is preparing for the "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific" according to its master's instructions.

    The memorandum said that the puppet regime of South Korea, as a running dog of U.S. imperialism, has consistently devoted itself to opposing the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia and Africa and undermining peace throughout its entire history, from the time of Syngman Rhee to Park Chung-hee. The fact that the South Korean Park Chung-hee regime sent tens of thousands of South Korean puppet troops to the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against South Vietnam as cannon fodder also shows that it is an unreserved puppet acting according to U.S. instructions. Today, the Park Chung-hee clique is attempting to hold the "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific," thereby further ingratiating itself with U.S. imperialism and maintaining its military fascist rule.

    The memorandum said that the convening of this "meeting" is another serious act of provocation against the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and all progressive people of the world who are fighting for liberation, national independence, peace, and social progress.

    The memorandum concluded: All peace-loving countries and people around the world will never allow U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarists, who are relying on it to embark on the road of re-aggression against Asia, to carry out aggressive activities.

    朝鲜外务省谴责美帝策划召开“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”
    坚决粉碎美帝及其傀儡拼凑侵略集团的阴谋
    新华社平壤三日电　朝鲜外务省在一日发表的一份备忘录说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民将为反对“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的召开，为粉碎美帝国主义威胁社会主义国家和民族独立国家安全的新的侵略活动而展开坚决斗争。
    这份备忘录揭露了在美帝国主义直接操纵下预定六月十四日在汉城召开的“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的阴谋的背景和侵略本质。
    备忘录指出，策划召开这次会议的罪魁祸首是美帝国主义。美帝国主义者正在企图从政治、经济、军事上把亚洲和太平洋地区的仆从国家和傀儡纠集在一起，形成单一的军事集团，以便完成它们侵略亚洲的军事战略体系。
    备忘录指出，美帝国主义一直在进行阴谋策划，企图拼凑“东北亚军事联盟”，作为侵略亚洲整个战略计划的一个环节。它们正企图使日本军国主义在这里起核心作用。美帝国主义还分别同菲律宾、南朝鲜傀儡集团、台湾蒋介石集团签订了“共同防御条约”。这样，就为把它们纠集在多边军事同盟体系里打下基础，迅速促进了日本军国主义重新武装的过程。
    备忘录说：为了把日本、南朝鲜和台湾纠集在单一的反共军事集团里，首先迫切要求“韩日国交正常化”。在美帝国主义指使下，南朝鲜傀儡集团和日本军国主义者于一九六五年六月结束了“韩日会谈”，实现了“国交”“正常化”。这不仅是南朝鲜和日本在政治、经济上的勾结，在本质上这是军事勾结。
    美帝国主义签订“韩日条约”以后，为了按照既定方针拼凑广泛的侵略性的军事集团，开始了更加疯狂的行动。特别是它在侵略越南战争中遭到不可挽救的失败以后，为了拼凑对付这种局面的新的军事同盟，而更加疯狂地走上冒险的道路。
    美帝国主义目前正在拼凑包括亚洲和太平洋地区所有仆从国家和傀儡在内的、扩大范围的军事集团，企图利用它来进行侵略越南的战争，使它更容易对亚洲进行侵略。美帝国主义为了逃脱亚洲和全世界人民的强烈反对和谴责，妄图指使它的追随国家用“经济合作”来掩饰拼凑侵略性的军事集团的阴谋。
    备忘录指出，日本在执行美帝国主义拼凑反共军事集团的战略计划方面起着“关键”的作用，这是同它的侵略野心直接有关的。日本军国主义者为了掩盖他们的侵略目的，叫嚣在即将召开的“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”上也必须讨论“经济文化合作”问题。
    美帝国主义最忠实的走狗朴正熙集团根据主子的指示，着手筹备“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”。
    备忘录说，南朝鲜的傀儡政权，作为美帝国主义的走狗，从李承晚时期到朴正熙的整个历史，一贯都是埋头于反对亚洲和非洲人民的民族解放运动、破坏和平的。南朝鲜朴正熙政权把几万名南朝鲜傀儡军送到美帝国主义侵略南越的战争中去当炮灰，这一点也表现出它是按照美国的指示行动的不折不扣的傀儡。今天朴正熙集团企图开成“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”，从而更加讨好美帝国主义，维持它的军事法西斯统治。
    备忘录说，这个“会议”的召开，是对为争取解放、民族独立、和平和社会进步而斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界所有进步人民的又一严重的挑衅行径。
    备忘录最后说：全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民决不允许美帝国主义和依靠它走上重新侵略亚洲道路的日本军国主义者进行侵略活动。
