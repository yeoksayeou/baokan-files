    Worker-Peasant-Soldier Heroic Images Occupy Puppet Theater
    Longxi Prefecture Puppet Troupe's Revolutionary Modern Dramas Well-Received in Beijing

    The Longxi Prefecture Puppet Troupe of Fujian recently performed a batch of revolutionary modern-themed glove puppet shows in Beijing, which were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the audience, especially workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the small stage of the glove puppet show, emperors, generals, talented scholars, beauties, and all kinds of demons and monsters were driven off the stage, and the glorious images of heroic workers, peasants, and soldiers occupied the position.

    Every play performed by the puppet troupe in Beijing this time aroused a strong response from the audience. Among them, the song and dance drama "People of All Nationalities Sing Praises to Chairman Mao" praising the great leader Chairman Mao, "Coconut Grove Battle Song" reflecting the struggle of the South Vietnamese army and people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, "Annihilating the Tiger," and "Sending a Briefcase" were particularly eye-catching. The audience praised their performances for being strong in ideology, novel in subject matter, diverse in style, innovative and developed in performance techniques, and the revolutionary political content and the artistic form of glove puppetry were relatively perfectly combined. The audience said that the glove puppet show has undergone a very meaningful revolution, which shows that the tide of the Great Cultural Revolution has swept all genres and stages, and also shows that the glove puppet show has found a correct path and has great development prospects. Many people who had never seen puppet shows before were attracted this time. Many people were dragged to see it for the first time, scrambled to see it for the second time, and brought a large group of people to see it for the third time.

    The audience warmly praised the Longxi Prefecture Puppet Troupe for resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, making up their minds to make revolution, daring to break through, daring to struggle, and daring to be revolutionary in the past few years. The practice of this troupe proves that they listened to the Party's words and Chairman Mao's words, and they had a vigorous and prosperous new scene and a bright future.

    Longxi glove puppetry has a history of more than 400 years. It directly manipulates puppets with the palms and ten fingers, and has formed a relatively fixed set of artistic programs for a long time. In the past, the Longxi Prefecture Puppet Troupe always performed ancient costume dramas of emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beauties, with only four or five so-called "retained repertoires," which the audience did not like to watch. Once, when they went out for touring performances, they only sold three tickets for one show and had to stop performing. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers issued a serious warning to them: If puppet shows are not reformed, they will go to a dead end!

    At this moment, the first revolutionary spring thunder sounded from the Beijing opera stage, and the magnificent tide of the Great Cultural Revolution also shook the actors of the puppet troupe. They said: Beijing opera can perform modern dramas, and our puppet shows can also perform modern dramas, and puppet shows must also make revolution. However, at that time, some people in the troupe still had great doubts in their minds. They were afraid that performing modern dramas would lose the traditional art, that modern dramas would not be suitable for the characteristics of puppet shows, that they would affect the quality of performance art, that they would not be welcomed by farmers, and so on. The Party branch of the troupe believed that the debate over whether to perform modern dramas was related to the revolutionary direction of the troupe. It immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other articles in depth, and launched a mass debate. In the debate, many comrades listed the disadvantages and crimes of ancient costume dramas. They said that performing ancient costume dramas was digging at the foundation of socialism. Chairman Mao told us that literature and art are "powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy." This combat task can only be undertaken by revolutionary modern dramas. Some old artists said, "If you want to truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, you must perform revolutionary modern dramas." And excitedly expressed, "Never be an expert in ancient costume dramas, willing to be a new soldier in modern dramas." The actors were determined to be thorough revolutionaries, and they sent all the puppets playing emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beauties to the puppet exhibition hall.

    For more than two years, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, gone deep into factories, mines, rural areas, mountainous areas, and the coastal defense front, and in the fiery struggle life, they have vigorously written and performed revolutionary modern dramas, shaping many heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They transformed, utilized, or drew lessons from the techniques and methods in traditional art that are conducive to expressing revolutionary struggle life and shaping the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers from life; more importantly, they extracted and created many new artistic forms from real life to express the spiritual outlook of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and express the new era of socialism.

    The actors of the troupe said that after the glove puppet show performed modern dramas, the art of performance has not withered, but has been greatly enriched, developed, and improved; the subject matter of performance is infinitely broad, and many dramas that real people cannot perform on stage can be expressed by puppet shows.

    The glove puppet show has entered a glorious new era. The puppet song and dance drama that is unprecedented in ancient and modern Chinese and foreign glove puppet shows -- "People of All Nationalities Sing Praises to Chairman Mao," appeared on the stage of Chinese puppet shows for the first time. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they dared to break through the shackles of "puppets are afraid of singing and dancing" for hundreds of years, created seventy-six singing and dancing puppet images, and performed more than a dozen highly difficult ethnic dances, enthusiastically praising the infinite love and infinite respect of people of all ethnic groups for the great leader Chairman Mao. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically praised it as the "The East is Red" on the puppet stage.

    In just over two years of performing revolutionary modern dramas, this ancient drama genre with special limitations has undergone earth-shaking changes. The revolutionary spirit has given this drama genre a new and powerful vitality. The small puppet stage can not only serve the Chinese revolution, but also reflect the storms of the world revolution, and contribute its own strength to the world revolution. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers have given the most powerful support, the most active encouragement, and the most enthusiastic care to the revolutionary glove puppet show. This flower in the garden of opera, due to the enthusiastic love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, is blooming more and more brightly. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached pictures)

    工农兵的英雄形象占领了木偶剧阵地
    龙溪专区木偶剧院在京演出革命现代剧受到热烈欢迎
    福建龙溪专区木偶剧院最近在北京演出了一批革命现代题材的布袋木偶剧，受到广大观众特别是工农兵的热烈欢迎。在这小小的布袋木偶剧的舞台上，帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神通通被赶下了台，英雄的工农兵的光辉形象占领了阵地。
    木偶剧院这次来京演出的每一个剧目，都引起了观众的强烈反响。其中歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌舞剧《各族人民歌颂毛主席》、反映越南南方军民抗美救国斗争的《椰林战歌》和《歼虎记》、《送皮包》等，特别引人注目。观众赞扬他们的演出思想性强，题材新颖，风格多样，表现技巧上有创新，有发展，革命的政治内容和布袋木偶剧的艺术形式结合得比较完美。观众说，布袋木偶剧进行了一场很有意义的大革命，这显示出文化大革命的浪潮已经席卷了所有剧种和舞台的大好形势，也说明布袋木偶剧找到了一条正确的道路，大有发展前途。许多从来没有看过木偶剧的人，这次都被吸引来了。很多人第一次被别人拉着去看，第二次争着去看，第三次就带着一大批人去看。
    观众热烈赞扬龙溪专区木偶剧院几年来坚决贯彻毛主席的指示，下狠心闹革命，敢于闯，敢于斗争，敢于革命的精神。这个剧院的实践证明，他们听了党的话，听了毛主席的话，就有了蓬蓬勃勃、欣欣向荣的新景象，就有了光辉灿烂的前程。
    龙溪布袋木偶剧有四百多年的历史。它是以手掌和十指直接操纵偶象，长期以来形成了一套比较固定的艺术程式。过去龙溪专区木偶剧院一直演的是帝王将相、才子佳人的古装戏，只有四五个所谓“保留剧目”，观众都不爱看。有一次，他们出去巡回演出，有一场只卖出了三张票，只好被迫停演。广大工农兵群众向他们提出了严重的警告：木偶剧如果再不改革，就要走到死胡同里去了！
    正在这时，从京剧舞台上发出了第一声革命的春雷，气势磅礴的文化大革命浪潮也震动了木偶剧院的演员们。他们说：京剧能演现代戏，我们木偶剧也能演现代戏，木偶剧也要闹革命。但是当时剧院里也有些人在思想上还存在很大的疑虑，他们怕演了现代戏，会把传统艺术丢了，怕现代戏不适合木偶剧的特点，会影响表演艺术质量，怕不受农民欢迎，等等。剧院党支部认为，演不演现代戏的这一场争论，关系到剧院的革命方向问题。立即组织大家深入学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等文章，展开群众性的大辩论。在辩论中，许多同志列举出古装戏的坏处和罪状，他们说，演古装戏就是挖社会主义的墙脚。毛主席告诉我们，文艺是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，这个战斗任务只有革命现代戏才能担当。有的老艺人说：“要想真正为工农兵服务，必须演革命现代戏。”并且激动地表示，“绝不当古装戏的专家，愿做现代戏的新兵”。演员们决心做彻底的革命派，他们把扮演帝王将相、才子佳人的木偶全部送进木偶展览室去了。
    两年多来，他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，深入工矿、农村、山区和海防前线，在火热的斗争生活中，大编大演革命现代戏，塑造了许多工农兵的英雄形象。他们把传统艺术里凡是有利于表现革命斗争生活和塑造工农兵英雄形象的技巧和手法，都从生活出发加以改造、利用或借鉴；更大量的是，他们从现实生活中提炼、创造出许多新的艺术形式，来表现工农兵的精神面貌，表现社会主义的新时代。
    剧院的演员们说，布袋木偶剧演了现代剧以后，表演艺术不是枯萎，而是大大地丰富、发展和提高了；表演的题材无限广阔，许多真人上舞台所不能演的剧目，木偶剧都能够表现出来。
    布袋木偶剧已经进入了一个光辉灿烂的新时代。古今中外布袋木偶剧所没有的木偶歌舞剧——《各族人民歌颂毛主席》，第一次出现在我国木偶剧舞台上。他们有了毛泽东思想的武装，就敢于冲破几百年来“木偶怕歌舞”的束缚，创造出七十六个载歌载舞的木偶形象，表演了十多种难度很高的民族舞蹈，热烈歌颂各族人民对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。许多工农兵热情地赞美说，这是木偶舞台上的《东方红》。
    布袋木偶剧这个有特殊限制的古老剧种，在演出革命现代剧的短短两年多来，已经起了翻天覆地的变化。革命的精神赋予了这个剧种以新的强大的生命力。小小的木偶剧舞台不但能为中国革命服务，而且也能反映世界革命的风暴，为世界革命贡献出了自己的力量。许多工农兵对革命的布袋木偶剧给予了最有力的支持，最积极的鼓励，最热情的关怀。这朵戏曲百花园中的鲜花，由于受到广大工农兵群众的热情爱护，因而开放得愈加鲜艳夺目了。　（新华社）（附图片）
