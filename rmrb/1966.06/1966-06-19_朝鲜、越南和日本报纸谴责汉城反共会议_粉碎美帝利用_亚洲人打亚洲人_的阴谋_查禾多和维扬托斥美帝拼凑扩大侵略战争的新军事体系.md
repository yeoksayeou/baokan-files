    According to Xinhua News Agency reports, newspapers from Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, as well as Asian-African Journalists Association Secretary-General Chawla and Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee Standing Secretariat Secretary Wijayanto, issued commentaries and statements, respectively, condemning the recent "Ministerial Meeting" of anti-communist nations and puppet groups in the Asian and Pacific region held in Seoul.
    The Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* published an editorial on the 18th, stating that the entire process of the "Seoul Conference" and the so-called "Joint Communique" that was issued clearly exposed the U.S. imperialists' attempt to intensify their aggression against Asia through this conference.
    The editorial stated that their talk of "United Nations resolutions on the Korean question," "the United Nations mission in Korea," etc., revealed their conspiracy to continue creating difficulties on the road to Korean reunification.
    The editorial stated that the Japanese militarists repeatedly touted the "necessity of international ties" and expressed "satisfaction" with the "Joint Communique" at the conference, thoroughly exposing their aggressive intentions to actively serve U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Asia and to prepare to extend their claws into the Asian and Pacific regions.
    The editorial stated that Park Chung-hee's appearance at the "Seoul Conference" as a faithful lackey executing U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies was a provocation against the Korean and Asian peoples.
    The editorial stated that the foolish schemes of U.S. imperialism and its followers are bound to be bankrupted. The Korean people will never allow any of the enemy's conspiracies to succeed and will resolutely struggle against the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhân Dân* published a commentary on the 18th, pointing out that the Vietnamese people resolutely condemn the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs for plotting to use the "Seoul Conference" and the institutions it established to intensify the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam and to prepare to invade other Asian countries. The Vietnamese people, together with the Asian people, are determined to launch a struggle to thwart all the aggressive schemes and actions of the United States and its running dogs.
    The Japanese Communist Party's organ *Akahata* published a commentary on the 17th, pointing out that the conference decided to hold regular meetings every year in the future, and stipulated that a Standing Committee be established during the period between this conference and the next to further conduct consultations. This is a most serious step attempting to turn this conference into a permanent anti-communist alliance.
    The commentary stated that at this "Ministerial Conference of the Asian and Pacific Region," "Japan acted as the biggest accomplice of U.S. aggression against Asia, actively promoted this conference, and plotted the conspiracy to establish an anti-communist alliance system in Asia."
    Asian-African Journalists Association Secretary-General Chawla issued a statement on the 16th, pointing out that this conference was held after the ratification of the "Japan-ROK Treaty" and the "restoration of friendly relations" between "Malaysia" and the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship. Its purpose is to realize a "purely Asian" aggressive system on the basis of these two reactionary developments in Asia. The U.S. imperialists are attempting to use this system to make "Asians fight Asians." They have appointed Japanese militarists as their "agents" among the Asian puppets. The Japanese militarists have gladly accepted this order, hoping to use this position to achieve the goal of economic expansion in Asia and revive their dream of a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
    The statement said that the "Seoul Conference" is a vicious and aggressive combination of reactionary forces in Asia, aimed at the Asian people who are fighting for liberation and independence. It is also in line with the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary policy of "containing China," which is directly aimed at the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Cambodia. The Asian and African peoples, who are waging a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, despise the puppets' "Seoul Conference" and are indignantly prepared to expose and completely shatter them.
    The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association and all Asian-African anti-imperialist journalists, together with the Asian-African people, strongly condemn and denounce the "Seoul Conference" manipulated by the United States.
    Wijayanto, Secretary of the Standing Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, stated in Conakry on the 16th that "U.S. imperialism is gathering its servants and puppets, attempting to piece together its military strategic system for aggression against Asia." Wijayanto said that the Seoul Conference is a new and serious provocation against the people of Asian countries, especially the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    Wijayanto said that the Asian-African jurists consistently support the struggle of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and believe that the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries will achieve final victory.

    粉碎美帝利用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋
    查禾多和维扬托斥美帝拼凑扩大侵略战争的新军事体系
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，朝鲜、越南和日本报纸以及亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多和亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处书记维扬托分别发表评论和声明，谴责最近在汉城举行的亚洲和太平洋地区反共国家和傀儡集团“部长会议”。
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》十八日发表社论说，“汉城会议”的整个过程和发表的所谓“联合公报”，清楚地暴露了美帝国主义企图通过这次会议加紧对亚洲进行侵略的阴谋。
    社论说，它们谈论什么“联合国关于朝鲜问题的决议”，“联合国在朝鲜的使命”等等，这暴露了它们在朝鲜统一道路上继续制造困难的阴谋。
    社论说，日本军国主义者在会议上一再鼓吹“国际联系的必要性”和对“联合公报”表示“满意”，这彻底暴露了它积极为美帝国主义侵略亚洲政策效劳并且准备把魔爪伸向亚洲和太平洋地区的侵略意图。
    社论说，朴正熙在“汉城会议”上以执行美帝国主义侵略政策的忠实走狗面目出现，是对朝鲜人民和亚洲人民的挑衅。
    社论说，美帝国主义及其仆从的愚蠢阴谋必将遭到破产。朝鲜人民绝不允许敌人的任何阴谋得逞，并坚决为反对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略阴谋而进行斗争。
    越南《人民报》十八日发表评论指出，越南人民坚决谴责美帝国主义及其走狗阴谋利用“汉城会议”和它所建立的机构来加强美国对越南的侵略战争和准备侵略亚洲其他国家。越南人民和亚洲人民一起，坚决展开斗争，挫败美国及其走狗的一切侵略阴谋和行动。
    日本共产党机关报《赤旗报》十七日发表评论指出，这次会议确定今后每年举行定期会议，而且规定这一次会议与下次会议期间，为进一步进行协商，成立常务委员会。这是企图把这次会议作为常设的反共联盟的一个最严重的步骤。
    评论说，在这次“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”上“日本充当了美国侵略亚洲的最大的帮凶，积极地推进了这次会议，策划了建立亚洲反共联盟体制的阴谋活动”。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多十六日发表声明指出，这次会议是在“韩日条约”批准后以及“马来西亚”和印度尼西亚法西斯军事独裁“恢复友好关系”之后举行的，其目的是要在亚洲这两个反动的事态发展的基础上，实现一个“纯亚洲的”侵略体系。美帝国主义者企图通过这个体系，使“亚洲人打亚洲人”。他们已任命日本军国主义分子在亚洲傀儡中担任他们的“代理人”。日本军国主义者欣然接受了这个命令，希望利用这种地位达到在亚洲进行经济扩张的目的和复活他们“大东亚共荣圈”的梦想。
    声明说，“汉城会议”是亚洲反动势力的恶毒的和侵略性的结合，矛头指向为争取解放和独立而斗争的亚洲人民。这也是配合美帝国主义者“遏制中国”的反革命政策的，这个政策直接针对着中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和柬埔寨等。和帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对斗争的亚非人民鄙视傀儡们的“汉城会议”，并义愤填膺地准备揭露和完全粉碎他们。
    声明说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处和一切亚非反帝的新闻同业以及亚非人民一道，强烈抨击和谴责美国所操纵的“汉城会议”。
    亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处书记维扬托，十六日在科纳克里发表声明指出，“美帝国主义纠集它的仆从和傀儡，企图拼凑它的侵略亚洲的军事战略体系”。维扬托说，汉城会议是对亚洲各国人民，特别是对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一个新的严重的挑衅。
    维扬托说，亚非法律工作者一贯支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略的斗争，并且相信，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民必将取得最后的胜利。
