    Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Revolutionary Teachers and Students, Full of Fighting Spirit in the Socialist Cultural Revolution
    Expose the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Element He Luting
    Editor's Note: The currently unfolding Great Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly expose, thoroughly criticize, and thoroughly overthrow all kinds of bourgeois representatives hidden within the revolutionary ranks. He Luting, the president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, is such a stubbornly reactionary bourgeois representative. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music have exposed He Luting's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, which is a great victory they have achieved in the Cultural Revolution. We now reprint the letters exposing He Luting's crimes from comrades Wan Li, Chen Lingqun, Zhang Bofan, Chao Zhijue, and Zhang Jielin, published in the *Jiefang Daily* and *Wenhui Daily* on the 8th.

    To the Editors of *Jiefang Daily* and *Wenhui Daily*:
    The great proletarian cultural revolution is like a storm sweeping away all monsters and demons, beating the so-called bourgeois "experts," "scholars," "authorities," and "patriarchs" to a pulp, leaving them disgraced and making all proletarian revolutionaries hold their heads high. The revolutionary teachers and students of our institute feel extremely excited.

      Under the combat call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, propelled by the nationwide high tide of the Cultural Revolution, and encouraged by the big-character poster of Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades from Peking University, our school has ferreted out He Luting, an important figure hidden within the Party and within the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the music world.

    He Luting is an extremely stubborn and reactionary bourgeois representative. For a long time, he has worn the cloak of "old revolutionary musician" and "Communist Party member," and occupied positions such as the president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, vice-chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, and chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Musicians Association, consistently engaging in counter-revolutionary activities against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Especially in those years when our country suffered temporary economic difficulties, he echoed the international anti-China chorus of monsters and demons, closely cooperated with domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and colluded with the "authorities" and "patriarchs" of "1930s literature and art" to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, shooting one poisonous arrow after another.

    In early 1961, just as the "Three-Family Village" gang was beating the drums to attack the Party and going on stage to do great things, He Luting thought the time had come and impatiently published two anti-Party talks within a month entitled "Musical Aesthetics and Others" and "Arduous Study is the Only Way to Create," saying that it was necessary to grasp the "fundamental issues." He Luting, who had long anti-Party experience, knew that he should not go into battle naked, so he used the guise of "discussing aesthetics" and "talking about technology" to attack the Party in a roundabout and tortuous way. He used the same tone as the "Three-Family Village" gang to place a large pile of "crimes" on our Party, such as "one-sidedness," "simplification," "not proceeding from reality," and "grasping one end and losing the other"; he slandered us for "not using our brains and only judging right and wrong based on the wind direction"; he nonsensically said that revolutionary musical works were "written quickly, sung quickly, forgotten quickly, and discarded quickly," and that "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do will also fail." Even after saying such vicious words, He Luting still felt it was not enough to relieve his hatred, and he deliberately told reporters: I "don't want to say more, otherwise people will say I am 'opposing the Great Leap Forward.'" This is truly a clumsy attempt to conceal something, completely exposing the deep-seated hatred for the Party in his heart.

    He Luting's two talks were quickly cheered by bourgeois intellectuals in the music world. They said that He Luting "broke the long-term silence" and that He Luting's words were "earnest" and "pointed, and expressed feelings." These people confirmed from the opposite side the reactionary essence of He Luting's so-called "purely academic" talks!

    After a series of black talks were issued, creation also closely followed. In the spring of 1962, He Luting pulled out the black goods from the 1930s from the bottom of the box—five orchestral pieces full of bourgeois decadent atmosphere that he had dubbed for movies and dramas in the past, carefully repaired them, and stuffed them into concerts. In 1934, under the reactionary rule in the White Area, facing the ruined and declining countryside and the hungry and cold peasants, He Luting actually played light and joyful hymns such as "The Shepherd's Flute"; while in 1962, the new China, thirteen years after liberation, facing the rising sun of the people's commune and the hard-working commune members, he wanted to play sorrowful sounds such as "Night Flute in a Desolate Village" and "Buddhist Music." What is this for? What is the intention? What does "Buddhist Music" allude to? What does "Night Flute in a Desolate Village" allude to? In addition, where are the two songs that wanted to be released but did not dare to be released, "New Life in the Mountains" and "Elegy," pointing their spearheads? The Deng Tuo gang used black talk to curse our Party, the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune; He Luting used black music to insinuate and compare, how closely coordinated!

    He Luting's attack on the Party reached a frenzied degree between July and September 1962. At this time, domestic and foreign monsters and demons were taking advantage of our implementation of the eight-character policy of "adjustment, consolidation, filling out, and raising standards" to attempt to subvert our Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. He Luting also went into battle naked at this time. He made naked attacks at some important meetings, directly pointing the finger at our beloved Chairman Mao. He arrogantly clamored: "'Mass movement is not embroidery,' 'Correcting a wrong must be overcorrected,' these words themselves are wrong and are the root cause of 'leftism.'" He frantically cursed that "the Great Leap Forward is an empty term, encouraging impatience, exaggerating style, not wanting science, and violating the laws." He Luting gnashed his teeth and cursed the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune that "can be sent to the coffin." All comrades who love Chairman Mao, love the Party, and love socialism! How can we not feel righteous indignation and burning anger towards He Luting's vicious attacks, which are no different from those of Khrushchev revisionists and "Three-Family Village" black gang members!

    He Luting, who harbors deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, extremely hates the great Mao Zedong Thought on literature and art. In order to promote the conspiracy of peaceful evolution through music and capitalist restoration, he has consistently and madly attacked and opposed Mao Zedong Thought on literature and art for more than ten years after liberation.

      He Luting used the same venomous tone as Hu Feng elements to curse that the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers is "treating the people as machines," and that composers should create according to the "formulized, conceptualized" "bill of emotions," turning them into "composition machines"; attacking musical works that closely cooperate with revolutionary struggles and express the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "slogans with Arabic numerals," "rough shouts," "only roaring and rumbling strong sounds," "hardly pieced together, li li la la, chaotic"; slandering those who implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction and create revolutionary songs for serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as "Arabic numeral faction" and "two-four faction."

    He Luting, this bourgeois representative figure in the guise of "old revolutionary musician," hates Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction and proletarian revolutionary music to the bone, using every means to put them to death and be quick; and for those bourgeois and revisionist rags, he regards them as gods. When mentioning those things, it is all about "great," "immortal," "very beautiful," "profound artistic conception," "can arouse people's feelings and fantasies"... He lifted them up to the ninth heaven. The broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the broad masses of mass musical activists, the broad masses of revolutionary musical workers! We must rise up and give a devastating blow to the bourgeois and revisionist literature and art that He Luting has vigorously promoted and publicized. We must use the proletarian’s powerful singing to overwhelm the buzzing of flies such as He Luting.

    He Luting even more desperately attacked Chairman Mao's great call to all revolutionary literary and art workers to go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He said that "often someone excessively emphasized the transformation of the performers' thoughts and feelings, and even asked musicians to give up their usual technical training and go to experience life or study politics for a long time," and that if this continues, "it will not only be impossible to perform musical works, but even understanding or recognizing the content of the works will be impossible." He arrogantly shouted, "If you often leave your business and go to the countryside to experience life, the final result will only be 'changing careers' to finish"; he even clamored that "emphasizing the idea of creation and direction of creation" "will commit serious mistakes, and will be grasping a point and losing the whole." Here, He Luting has launched a comprehensive challenge to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. He vainly attempted to make people abandon Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the lifeblood of revolutionary literary and art work, and fall into the quagmire of bourgeois individualism and fame-seeking thought. This is absolutely impossible.

    He Luting also blatantly promoted bourgeois liberalization. He opposed our weeding out poisonous weeds, saying that "it should be raising flowers instead of cutting grass." He tried his best to fight for freedom for the rampant growth of poisonous weeds, trying to let those bourgeois "authorities," "experts," and "scholars" freely release poison, trying to disrupt the proletarian world and specialize in proletarian politics. He Luting praised and praised the poisonous weeds released by those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," while he hated revolutionary literary criticism. While proposing the so-called "raising flowers theory," he frantically attacked revolutionary literary criticism for being "in an abnormal state," with a "smell of gunpowder," and "only daring to follow the masses to beat dead tigers." When some young music workers rose up to criticize Huang Zi, the anti-communist bourgeois music scholar of the 1930s, He Luting could not restrain his anger and personally wielded a knife and pen on the manuscript of the "History of Modern Chinese Music" written by young music workers, attacking them as "cursing everything" and sorry for the "music predecessors." In 1963, when Comrade Yao Wenyuan wrote an article criticizing the French bourgeois musician Debussy, he jumped out and fought with us, impatiently giving a talk to reporters, and writing an article under the pseudonym "Shangu," viciously attacking comrades who criticized Debussy as "acting as thugs" and "knocking down with one blow, and completely denying." Look, how rampant and domineering is this bourgeois royalist!

    We want to solemnly point out to He Luting: The "smell of gunpowder" you attacked, the "acting as thugs," and the "killing with one blow," from our proletarian standpoint, are all revolutionary great things. We must use the revolutionary "smell of gunpowder" to dispel the evil winds and poisonous mists of all exploiting class ideologies. We must act as "thugs" together with the main force of the cultural revolution, the workers, peasants and soldiers, to knock down all monsters and demons. We will "kill with one blow" all anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, so that they will never be able to turn over. The proletarian cultural revolution is to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, to fundamentally eradicate the foundation on which bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" like you, He Luting, rely for survival, and to smash your dream of capitalist restoration!

    For more than ten years, He Luting has never relaxed his efforts to seize the leadership of music education for the bourgeoisie. With the deepening of the education revolution, He Luting's hatred for the Party has become deeper and deeper. In 1963, he threw out a whole set of programmatic reactionary educational propositions and launched a frenzied attack on the Party's educational policy. He clamored that the "nature" of music schools was "not very clear," that the "tasks" were "not clear," and that running schools was "without purpose, without plan, and without standards." He nonsensically said that music schools should be "scientific research institutions" and "technical schools," insulted the Party's political work in schools, and opposed carrying out political movements. He said that "there have been too many movements in the past few years," which has lowered "teaching quality," and even viciously slandered us for "taking going deep into life" as "the first lesson," which has become a "joke." In short, every step forward in the education revolution, he would attack by any means. He Luting even shamelessly boasted that the music schools run by the Kuomintang reactionaries had a "glorious history" and "cultivated talents." He also brought out the set of feudal educational systems of "Ke Ban" and "Jiaofang," asking us to "inherit all these valuable traditional experiences." Obviously, He Luting's conspiracy is to turn our socialist schools into reactionary fortresses serving capitalist restoration.

    In order to realize this conspiracy, He Luting vigorously praised the so-called bourgeois "scholars," "experts," and "authorities," saying that they were "knowledgeable" and "worked well," as if without them, schools could not be run. He threatened us that those "authorities" should be allowed to "feel comfortable," otherwise it would be "dangerous." In order to put these people on the stage, He Luting had already coordinated with the rightists in 1957 to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, jumping around and shouting in the Musicians Association: "Whoever has the ability to work should be allowed to lead," and claiming to establish a so-called "democratic school management system" in the Conservatory of Music; later, He Luting changed his face and said that it was necessary to "rely on" "old experts" to run the school. In a word, it is to let the proletariat give way to the bourgeoisie.

    He Luting openly tempted young students to be filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the bourgeoisie, asking everyone to learn from his mentor Huang Zi's "creation, teaching, and even personal moral character," and to take Liu Tianhua, a bourgeois musician of thirty years ago, as an example, to be today's Liu Tianhua, blatantly inciting young students to betray the working people and betray the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    He Luting also engaged in "special training," privately recruiting students who were technically outstanding but also had ideological problems, personally guiding them, and using participation in international competitions as a bait to make them struggle individually. When some young people who were deceived at the time created bad works such as "Autumn Wind Falling Leaves" and "Devil's Dance" that expressed decadent and declining emotions, He Luting said with ulterior motives that their "path was correct." This is how He Luting induced young people to pursue the bourgeois path of becoming famous and becoming experts, and to act as heirs of the bourgeoisie.

    For more than ten years, He Luting has been using his leading positions such as the president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, painstakingly promoting the bourgeois expert-run school policy, implementing the revisionist education line, and recklessly carrying out bourgeois restoration activities. Now is the time to thoroughly settle accounts with him.

    All the facts fully prove that He Luting is a bourgeois representative who has infiltrated the Party. For a long time, he has relied on the "patriarchs" of "1930s literature and art" to support him from above, and the bourgeois "professors" and "experts" to hold his feet from below, so he is fearless and arrogantly anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Even after the revolutionary teachers and students of our Conservatory of Music used thousands of big-character posters to expose his reactionary true face, he still used the lie that "I am just talking about technology, I will not oppose the Party" to resist stubbornly.

    We want to solemnly warn He Luting: No matter how old you are, no matter how high your position is, no matter how deep your potential power is, in front of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and under the stormy waves of the proletarian cultural revolution, all your conspiracies will be thoroughly exposed; the set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines you promoted in the school will be thoroughly overthrown; all your anti-Party and anti-socialist activities will be thoroughly crushed.

    We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    上海音乐学院革命师生在社会主义文化大革命中斗志昂扬
    揪出反党反社会主义分子贺绿汀
    编者按：目前正在开展的文化大革命，就是要把隐藏在革命队伍中的各种各样的资产阶级代表人物彻底揭露，彻底批判，彻底打倒。上海音乐学院院长贺绿汀就是这样一个顽固的反动的资产阶级代表人物。上海音乐学院的革命师生，揭露了贺绿汀的反党反社会主义罪行，这是他们在文化大革命中取得的一个大胜利。现将《解放日报》和《文汇报》八日发表的万里、陈聆群、张伯藩、巢志珏、张杰林等五位同志的揭露贺绿汀罪行的信件转载如下。
    解放日报和文汇报编辑同志：
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命势如暴风骤雨，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把资产阶级的所谓“专家”、“学者”、“权威”、“祖师爷”打得落花流水，威风扫地，使一切无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气。我院革命师生都感到无比振奋。
      在毛主席和党中央的战斗号召下，在全国文化大革命高潮的推动下，在北京大学聂元梓等七同志的大字报的鼓舞下，我们学校揪出了隐藏在党内的、音乐界反党反社会主义黑线里的重要人物贺绿汀。
    贺绿汀是一个极其顽固的反动的资产阶级代表人物。长期以来，他披着“老革命音乐家”、“共产党员”的外衣，窃据上海音乐学院院长、中国音乐家协会副主席、中国音乐家协会上海分会主席等职位，一贯干着反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命勾当。特别是在我们国家遭受暂时经济困难那几年，他与国际上牛鬼蛇神的反华大合唱相呼应，同国内地富反坏紧密配合，伙同那些“三十年代文艺”的“权威”、“祖师爷”，向党发动了猖狂进攻，射出了一支又一支的毒箭。
    一九六一年初，正当“三家村”黑帮敲起向党进攻的密锣紧鼓，登台大干的时候，贺绿汀以为时机已到，迫不及待地在一个月内连续发表了题为
  《音乐美学和其他》、《艰苦学习才能有所创造》两篇反党谈话，说什么要抓“根本问题”。有着长期反党经验的贺绿汀，深知不可赤膊上阵，打起“谈美学”、“讲技术”的幌子，迂回、曲折地向党进攻。他用“三家村”黑帮同样的腔调，给我们党栽上了一大堆“罪状”，什么“片面性”、“简单化”、“不从实际出发”、“抓住一头丢了另一头”；他污蔑我们“不开动脑筋，专凭风向判断是非”；胡说革命音乐作品“写得快，唱得快，忘得快，丢得快”，“敢想、敢说、敢做也会落空”。话说得这样恶毒，贺绿汀仍觉得不足以解恨，还别有用心地对记者说：我“不愿多讲，否则人家会说我是‘反对大跃进’。”这真是欲盖弥彰，彻底暴露了他内心深处对党的刻骨仇恨。
    贺绿汀的两次谈话，很快在音乐界资产阶级知识分子中得到欢呼。他们说贺绿汀“打破了长时期的闷气”，说贺绿汀的话“语重心长”是“有所指，有所感而发”。这些人从反面证实了贺绿汀这两篇所谓“纯学术”的谈话的反动本质！
    黑话连篇发出，创作也紧紧跟上。一九六二年春天，贺绿汀从箱底里翻出了三十年代的黑货——当年他为电影、话剧配音的五首充满着资产阶级腐朽气息的管弦乐曲，加以精心修补，塞进了音乐会。贺绿汀在一九三四年反动统治下的白区，面对着雕敝败落的农村和饥寒交迫的农民，竟然弹出了《牧童短笛》之类的轻快欢悦的赞歌；而在一九六二年即解放十三年的新中国，面对着旭日东升的人民公社和奋发图强的公社社员，却要演奏《荒村夜笛》、《佛曲》之类的哀声。这是为的什么？是什么用心？《佛曲》影射什么？《荒村夜笛》影射什么？另外还有两首想出笼而未敢出笼的《山中新生》和《哀歌》又是把矛头指向那里？邓拓黑帮用黑话咒骂我们党、咒骂总路线、大跃进、人民公社；贺绿汀则用黑曲子含沙射影，隐喻比拟，配合得何等紧密！
    贺绿汀向党的进攻，在一九六二年七月到九月间，达到了疯狂的程度。这时，国内外的牛鬼蛇神正乘我们执行“调整、巩固、充实、提高”的八字方针的时机，妄图颠覆我们党，颠覆无产阶级专政。贺绿汀也就在这个时候赤膊上阵了。他在一些重要会议上进行赤裸裸的攻击，把矛头直接指向我们敬爱的毛主席。他狂妄地叫嚣：“‘群众运动不是绣花’，‘矫枉必须过正’，这些话本身就是错的，是造成‘左’的根子。”他疯狂地咒骂“大跃进是空洞名词，鼓励急躁情绪，浮夸作风，不要科学，违反规律”。贺绿汀咬牙切齿地诅咒党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社“可以送入棺材了”。一切热爱毛主席、热爱党、热爱社会主义的同志们！对贺绿汀这些同赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子、“三家村”黑帮分子毫无二致的恶毒攻击，我们怎能不义愤填胸、怒火中烧！
    对党对社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的贺绿汀，极端仇视伟大的毛泽东文艺思想。为了推行通过音乐搞和平演变，搞资本主义复辟的阴谋，他在解放后十余年中一贯疯狂地攻击和反对毛泽东文艺思想。
      贺绿汀用同胡风分子一样刻毒的腔调，咒骂为工农兵服务的文艺方向是“把人民当作机器”，是要作曲家按“公式化、概念化”的“感情的账单”去创作，变成“作曲机器”；攻击密切配合革命斗争、表现工农兵思想感情的音乐作品是“配上阿拉伯数字的口号”，是“粗糙的叫喊”，“只有轰隆轰隆的强烈音响”，“硬拼硬凑，哩哩啦啦，杂乱无章”；诽谤那些执行毛主席文艺方向，创作为工农兵服务的革命歌曲的音乐工作者是“阿拉伯数字派”，“四分之二派”。
    贺绿汀这个披着“老革命音乐家”外衣的资产阶级代表人物，对于毛泽东文艺方向，对于无产阶级革命音乐，恨之入骨，无所不用其极，必欲置之死地而后快；而对于那些资产阶级的、修正主义的破烂，却奉为神明，一提到那些货色，就是什么“伟大”、“不朽”、“非常美”、“意境深”、“能够引起人们的感情和幻想”……，把它们捧到了九霄云上。广大的工农兵群众，广大的群众音乐活动分子，广大革命的音乐工作者！我们必须起来，给贺绿汀所极力鼓吹宣扬的资产阶级、修正主义文艺以毁灭性的打击。我们要用无产阶级的磅礴歌声，压倒贺绿汀之流的苍蝇嗡叫。
    对于毛主席向一切革命的文艺工作者提出的深入工农兵群众，全心全意为工农兵服务的伟大号召，贺绿汀更是拼命攻击。他说什么“常常有人过分强调了表演家的思想感情的改造，甚至要音乐家放弃自己经常的技巧锻炼，长期地去体验生活或学习政治”，这样下去“不但不可能表演音乐作品，就连理解或认识作品的内容都是不可能的。”他狂妄地叫喊“假如经常离开自己的业务下乡去体验生活的话，那么最后的结果只好是‘改行’完事”；他甚至叫嚷“强调创作思想、创作方向”，“就会犯严重的错误，就会是抓住一点丢了全面”。贺绿汀在这里向毛泽东文艺思想提出了全面挑战。他妄图使人们抛弃毛泽东文艺思想这一革命文艺工作的命根子，陷到资产阶级个人主义名利思想的泥坑中去。这是绝对办不到的。
    贺绿汀还露骨地鼓吹资产阶级自由化。他反对我们锄毒草，说什么“应当是养花而不是割草”。他竭力为毒草泛滥争自由，力图要让那些资产阶级“权威”、“专家”、“学者”去自由放毒，妄图搞乱无产阶级的天下，来专无产阶级的政。贺绿汀对那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”放出来的毒草，大吹特吹，大捧特捧，而对于革命的文艺批评则深恶痛绝。他在提出所谓“养花论”的同时，疯狂地攻击革命的文艺批评“处在不正常的状态之中”，有“火药气味”，“只敢跟在群众后面打死老虎”。当一些青年音乐工作者起来批判三十年代反共的资产阶级音乐学阀黄自的时候，贺绿汀按捺不住满腔仇恨，亲自动手在青年音乐工作者编写的《中国现代音乐史》手稿上刀砍笔伐，攻击他们是“骂倒一切”、对不起“音乐前辈人”。一九六三年，当姚文元同志著文批判法国资产阶级音乐家德彪西的时候，他又跳出来同我们拼命，迫不及待地对记者发表谈话，并化名“山谷”写文章，恶毒攻击对德彪西进行批判的同志是“充当打手”，是“一棍子打倒、全盘否定”。请看，这个资产阶级保皇党是何等猖狂，何等霸道！
    我们要向贺绿汀严正指出：你所攻击的“火药气味”啊，“充当打手”啊，“一棍子打死”啊，从我们无产阶级立场看来，一概都是革命的大好事。我们就是要用革命的“火药气味”来驱散一切剥削阶级意识形态的妖风毒雾。我们就是要同文化革命的主力军工农兵群众一起，充当打倒一切牛鬼蛇神的“打手”。我们就是要把一切反党反社会主义的毒草“一棍子打死”，让它们永世不得翻身。无产阶级文化大革命就是要保卫无产阶级专政，就是要从根本上铲除你贺绿汀这样的资产阶级“学阀”、“权威”赖以安身立命的基础，粉碎你们的资本主义复辟的迷梦！
    十几年来，贺绿汀从来没有放松过为资产阶级争夺音乐教育的领导权。随着教育革命的步步深入，贺绿汀对党的仇恨越来越深。在一九六三年，他抛出了一整套纲领性的反动教育主张，对党的教育方针，发动了猖狂的进攻。他叫嚣音乐院校的“性质”“不十分明确”，“任务”“不清楚”，办学“无目的、无计划、无标准”。他胡说音乐院校应该是“科学研究机关”，是“技术学校”，辱骂党在学校中的政治工作，反对开展政治运动。他说什么“这几年运动太多”，降低了“教学质量”，还刻毒地污蔑我们“把深入生活”作为“第一课”，已经成了“笑话”。总之，教育革命每前进一步，他都要不择手段地攻击一番。贺绿汀甚至无耻地吹嘘国民党反动派办的音乐学校有着“光荣的历史”，“培养了人才”。他还端出“科班”、“教坊”这一套封建的教育制度，要我们把这些“宝贵的传统经验都继承过来”。很明显，贺绿汀的阴谋就是要把我们社会主义的学校，办成为资本主义复辟效劳的反动堡垒。
    为了实现这一阴谋，贺绿汀大肆吹捧资产阶级的所谓“学者”、“专家”、“权威”，说他们“知识渊博”、“工作优良”，似乎少了他们，就无法办学。他威胁我们要让那些“权威”“心情舒畅”，否则是“危险的”。为了把这些人捧上台，贺绿汀早在一九五七年就配合右派，向党猖狂进攻，跳东窜西，在音乐家协会大叫大嚷：“谁有工作能力，就让谁来领导”，在音乐学院声称要建立所谓“民主办学制度”；后来，贺绿汀又改头换面，说什么要“依靠”“老专家”来办学。一句话，就是要无产阶级让位给资产阶级。
    贺绿汀公然诱惑青年学生做资产阶级的孝子贤孙，要大家向他的恩师黄自的“创作、教学、以至个人的道德品质”学习，要大家以三十年前的资产阶级音乐家刘天华为榜样，做今天的刘天华，明目张胆地煽动青年学生背叛劳动人民，背叛无产阶级革命事业。
    贺绿汀还大搞“特殊培养”，在院外私自招揽技术冒尖，思想问题也冒尖的学生，亲自指导，以参加国际比赛为诱饵，要他们个人奋斗。有的当时受到蒙蔽的青年创作了表现颓废、没落情绪的《秋风落叶》、《魔鬼翩跹》之类坏作品时，贺绿汀心怀叵测地说他们的“路走对了”。贺绿汀就是这样引诱青年去追求资产阶级成名成家道路，充当资产阶级的继承人。
    十几年来，贺绿汀就是利用他窃据的上海音乐学院院长等领导职位，处心积虑地推行资产阶级专家办学的方针，推行修正主义教育路线，放肆地进行资产阶级的复辟活动。现在是必须对他加以彻底清算的时候了。
    种种事实充分证明，贺绿汀是一个混进党里的资产阶级代表人物。长期以来，他倚仗着上有“三十年代文艺”的“祖师爷”们撑腰，下有资产阶级“教授”、“专家”们抱脚，有恃无恐，跋扈嚣张地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。直到我们音乐学院革命师生用千百张大字报揭发了他的反动真面目以后，他还用什么“我只是讲讲技术，不会反党”的谎言，负隅顽抗。
    我们要正告贺绿汀：不管你资格多老，不管你的地位多高，不管你的潜在势力多深，在毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨之下，你的一切阴谋，都是要被彻底戳穿的；你在学校里推行的一套反革命的修正主义路线，都是要被彻底推翻的；你的一切反党反社会主义活动，都是要被彻底粉碎的。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
