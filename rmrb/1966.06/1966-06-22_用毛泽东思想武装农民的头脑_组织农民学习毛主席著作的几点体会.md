    Arming Farmers' Minds with Mao Zedong Thought
    ——Some Experiences in Organizing Farmers to Study Chairman Mao's Writings
    Yang Fengming, Party Branch Secretary of Wangkeqiao Brigade, Zhugezhuang Commune, Xiong County, Hebei Province
    The members of our brigade are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's writings. How to lead Party members and all commune members to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works is a major task for the branch. We believe that the most fundamental way to educate farmers and transform their world outlook is to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Now, I will share some of my experiences in organizing commune members to study Chairman Mao's writings.
    I. Farmers Can Learn Chairman Mao's Writings Well
    Older farmers lived impoverished lives in the old society and had little literacy. However, it cannot be said that illiteracy prevents them from studying Chairman Mao's writings. Studying Chairman Mao's writings means using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform both the subjective and objective worlds. Chairman Mao's books are written for the broad masses of working people and describe what they are thinking. Therefore, farmers can understand Chairman Mao's words. Why do I say this? From a class perspective, poor and lower-middle peasants suffered oppression from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the old society. They have a strong sense of class and class struggle, and they can most easily grasp the issues of class struggle discussed by Chairman Mao. After liberation, class struggle has not stopped. Poor and lower-middle peasants urgently need to master Mao Zedong Thought to identify and strike at class enemies. Therefore, farmers are most capable of studying Chairman Mao's writings with class feelings. From a practical perspective, Chairman Mao pointed out that theory depends on practice, and practice is superior to theory. Farmers are practitioners in the three great revolutionary movements. Mao Zedong Thought is the theory that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. It is the thought that Chairman Mao brilliantly inherited and developed from Marxism-Leninism based on great revolutionary practice. It comes from practice and guides revolutionary practice. Therefore, farmers can grasp Mao Zedong Thought relatively quickly.
    Abundant facts show that farmers with low or no literacy can still learn Chairman Mao's writings well. There is an old poor peasant woman in our village, over fifty years old, named Xu Shuyin. She is illiterate, but she has a high level of enthusiasm for learning. She listens to others read, listens to others explain, keeps Chairman Mao's words in her heart, and acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings. She has become an active learner. She also motivates her family to study, and the whole family has been rated as "Five-Good" commune members.
    II. Study with Problems in Mind
    We must study Chairman Mao's writings with problems in mind.
    Where do the problems come from? To truly grasp the problems, we must seize living thoughts. How to seize living thoughts? Seize them from the three great revolutions, from various tasks; not seize everything, but seize the essential, the main, and the tendency. We must also clarify the impact of the situation, environment, conditions, etc., on the masses' thinking. Then select and read Chairman Mao's writings. Last year, our brigade drilled several machine wells. This was originally a good thing, but it also brought a new problem: some people looked down on "small indigenous groups" (referring to digging earth wells and building brick and stone wells). Some said: "Let other brigades do 'small indigenous groups'! We have electric motors. Turn on the switch, and water gushes out, it's really awesome!" This is a living thought with a tendency. We seized it and first led the commune members to study Chairman Mao's relevant writings, letting everyone discuss the question: "If American imperialism invades us and a war breaks out, how should we farm? Is it feasible to rely solely on electricity?" After thorough discussion, everyone realized the benefits of developing "small indigenous groups." Then, the Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "The Present Situation and Our Tasks After the Victory Over Japan." Everyone understood the principle that the enemy is sharpening his knives, and we must also sharpen our knives. The entire brigade had 700 mu of land that could not be irrigated by electricity. The original plan was to achieve water conservancy in two and a half months; everyone worked hard and, in just forty-three days, achieved water conservancy using "small indigenous groups."
    Grasp viewpoints and clarify right and wrong. For a matter, a problem, or a viewpoint, if it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, it is "right"; if it does not conform, it is "wrong." Based on this standard, we have solved many people's ideological problems and continuously raised people's consciousness.
    III. Persist in Being Few but Essential
    Studying more and studying less are the unity of opposites. Less is the beginning of more, and more is the accumulation of less. Learning should adhere to the principle of being few but essential. Initially, our thinking was not very clear on this, and we were trying to swallow more than we could chew. Once, when tutoring the militia, we lectured on "On Practice" in one evening, and the result was not very effective. Later, we changed to studying less and studying more thoroughly, and the results were very good.
    IV. Study with Class Feelings
    Studying Chairman Mao's writings with class feelings further cultivates class feelings. Poor and lower-middle peasants have tasted the bitterness of oppression and exploitation in the old society and feel Chairman Mao's words most deeply; young people mostly talk about theory and are not easily touched in their thinking. Therefore, we let young people and old people study together. Educated youths read Chairman Mao's writings to poor and lower-middle peasants who are not very literate, helping them to learn. Old poor peasants with deep hatred tell young people about their history, conducting class education for the youth. The more people hate the old society, the more they love Chairman Mao, and the higher their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's writings.
    V. Progress Gradually from Shallow to Deep, See the Big in the Small, and Improve Step by Step
    We cannot ask farmers to become fat with one bite; nor can we ask them to complete the transformation of their world outlook in one morning. There must be a gradual process of improvement. In the middle of this, we must be good at building ladders for the masses. It is impossible for some people to devote themselves to the revolution all at once, so we first educate them to love the collective.
    Farmers are practitioners. They have perceptual knowledge. However, they cannot move forward if perceptual knowledge does not rise to rationality. Going from being unconscious to being conscious, from economic interests to political interests, is an improvement. Kang Yulin, the cart driver of the First Production Team, is energetic and does not rest even during the Spring Festival. Someone asked him: "Why are you harnessing the cart on the first day of the New Year?" He said: "I'm just staying idle anyway, and the cadres always praise me, so I have to work harder!" "Why are you working?" He said: "To work and eat!" This sentence reflected that his view of working for the revolution was not clear. In order to improve his ideological awareness, we tutored him in studying "Serve the People." Kang Yulin gradually realized that feeding the livestock and using the livestock were all for the collective, not for earning work points, or getting a good reputation. His enthusiasm for labor was even greater. When people asked him again, he replied: "We are also doing revolution here."
    Be good at guiding the masses to see the big picture from the small, and connect everything with the revolution of the country and the people of the world. The big includes the small; if you only pursue the small, you will forget the big. When tutoring the masses, we must base ourselves on the whole country and the whole world and not just talk about how a production team or Wangkeqiao is doing. In this way, we can continuously improve the consciousness of the farmers to a new and higher level.
    VI. Cultivate Active Learners
    We have cultivated various types of active learners, including old people, young people, women with children, cadres, commune members, keepers, service personnel, couples who study well, and red families. In this way, everyone has a model to learn from and a goal to catch up with. We also regularly convene these people to exchange experiences, lead everyone, and improve ourselves.
    VII. Tutoring Methods Should Be Flexible
    Farmers have very little literacy, and some are illiterate. How should they learn? Is it better to read or to explain? Sometimes, if you just read the original text to them, they won't listen; sometimes, if you explain a lot, they can't tell which words are Chairman Mao's. We have gradually explored a method, that is, the tutor first clarifies the main idea of ​​the article, determines which issues to discuss, and what requirements the masses should achieve after learning, and then, according to the ideological problems of the masses at that time, determines which part is more suitable for them to focus on studying. When explaining to the farmers, clarify Chairman Mao's point of view, and explain which are Chairman Mao's words and which are our supplementary explanations. The supplementary explanations should be appropriate. The purpose is to enable the farmers to better understand Mao Zedong Thought.
    VIII. Tutors Should Be Students of the Masses
    The tutors in our village are mostly educated youths. They are enthusiastic about learning, and active in their work, but their weakness is that they have little practical struggle experience. We want these young tutors to humbly learn from the farmers and first be students of the masses. For example, some young tutors do not understand what rent reduction and interest reduction are, so they are asked to consult the old poor peasants and old lower-middle peasants. When they talk about this issue again, they are full of class feelings, and the masses report that they speak well and are understandable.
    IX. Cadres Take the Lead in Learning, and Party Branch Secretaries Should Take the Lead Even More
    Socialist revolution and construction rely on Mao Zedong Thought for guidance; without Mao Zedong Thought, we will make mistakes. Studying Chairman Mao's writings should not be done sometimes and not done at other times. We must study regularly. In addition to solving ideological problems, we also emphasize that leaders should learn. This leader is the Party branch secretary. The Party branch secretary sets an example and leads other cadres to study. Only when cadres study well first can they lead the masses to study well.
    We believe that the process of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings is a process of breaking bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology. Whether to study Chairman Mao's writings is a question of whether to have revolution and whether to have socialism. If we want to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the socialist revolution through to the end, we must study Chairman Mao's writings for a lifetime, transform ourselves for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime. The fundamental issue in organizing farmers to study Chairman Mao's writings is to start from the characteristics of farmers, closely combine with the practice of the three great revolutions, seize living thoughts, and make great efforts in application; the purpose of learning is to use it, and if it is used well, it can encourage the masses to have higher enthusiasm for learning.

    用毛泽东思想武装农民的头脑
    ——组织农民学习毛主席著作的几点体会
    河北省雄县朱各庄公社王克桥大队党支部书记　杨凤鸣
    我们大队的社员正在热情地学习毛主席著作。怎样领导好党员和全体社员活学活用毛主席的书，是支部的一件大事。我们认为：教育农民，改造农民的世界观，最根本的办法就是用毛泽东思想去武装他们的头脑。现在，我谈谈组织社员学习毛主席著作的一些体会。
    一、农民能够学好毛主席著作
    上了年纪的农民，在旧社会过穷苦生活，很少有读书识字的。但是，不能说不识字就不能学习毛主席著作。学习毛主席著作，就是以毛泽东思想为武器，改造主观世界和客观世界。毛主席的书，是为广大劳动人民写的，都是写的劳动人民心里想的事情。所以，毛主席的话，农民能够听懂。为什么这样说呢？从阶级性讲，贫农下中农在旧社会饱受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫，他们的阶级和阶级斗争观点强，对毛主席讲的阶级斗争问题最容易领会。解放后，阶级斗争也没停止过。贫农下中农迫切需要掌握毛泽东思想，去识别阶级敌人和打击阶级敌人。所以，农民最能带着阶级感情学毛主席著作。从实践性来讲，毛主席指出，理论依赖实践，实践高于理论。农民在三大革命运动中是实践者。毛泽东思想，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的理论，是毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义的思想，它从实践中来，又指导革命实践。因此，农民领会毛泽东思想较快。
    大量的事实说明，农民文化水平不高或者没有文化，同样能够学好毛主席著作。我们村有位五十多岁的贫农老大娘，名叫许书银。她大字不识，学习热情很高，听别人念，听别人讲，把毛主席的话记在心里，按照毛主席的教导去做，成了一名学习积极分子。她还带动家里人学习，全家被评为“五好”社员。
    二、带着问题学
    对毛主席著作必须带着问题学。
    问题从哪里来？要真正摸准问题，就必须抓住活思想。怎么抓活思想？从三大革命中抓，从各项工作中抓；不是什么都抓，而是要抓本质的东西、主要的东西、倾向性的东西。还要弄清形势、环境、条件等等对群众思想上的影响。然后再选读毛主席著作。去年我们这个大队，打了几眼机井。这本来是好事情，可是也带来了一个新问题：有些人看不起“小土群”（指挖土井和修砖石井）了。有的说：“让别的大队去搞‘小土群’吧！咱们有电动机，一合闸，哗哗的水，真带劲！”这便是带有倾向性的活思想。我们抓住了它，首先领导社员学习毛主席的有关著作，让大家讨论这样一个问题：“如果美帝国主义侵略咱们，打起仗来，咱们该怎样种地？单纯靠电行不行？”经过充分讨论，大家认识到了搞“小土群”的好处。然后，党支部又组织大家学习了毛主席的《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》。大家明白了敌人在磨刀、我们也要磨刀的道理。全大队有七百亩不能电灌的地，原先计划两个半月时间实现水利化；大家一鼓干劲，只四十三天便用“小土群”的办法，实现了水利化。
    抓观点，明确是非。一件事情，一个问题，一个观点，符合毛泽东思想的就是“是”，不符合的就是“非”。我们根据这个标准，解决了许多人的思想问题，不断地提高人们的觉悟。
    三、坚持少而精
    多学点和少学点是对立的统一，少是多的开始，多是少的积累。学习应该坚持少而精的原则。开始，我们这个思想不太明确，有些贪多嚼不烂。有一次，辅导民兵学习，一个晚上就把《实践论》都讲了，结果收效不大。后来，我们改为少学点、学透点的办法，收效很好。
    四、带着阶级感情学
    带着阶级感情学习毛主席著作，又进一步培养阶级感情。贫农下中农饱尝旧社会压迫剥削的苦，对毛主席的话感受最深；青年们多是讲理论，不易触及思想。因此，我们让青年人和老年人结合起来学习。知识青年给识字不多的贫农下中农念毛主席著作，帮助他们学习。苦大仇深的老贫农给青年们讲自己的历史，对青年进行阶级教育。人们对旧社会越痛恨，对毛主席越热爱，学习毛主席著作的热情越高。
    五、由浅入深，小中见大，逐步提高
    农民学习，不能要求他们一口吃个胖子；改造世界观，也不能要求一个早晨就完成，总得有个逐步提高的过程。在这中间，我们要善于给群众搭好梯子。有些人一下子叫他们献身革命是不可能的，我们就先对他们进行热爱集体的教育。
    农民是实践者。他们有感性知识。但是，感性知识不上升到理性，他们是不能前进的。从自为到自觉，从经济利益到政治利益，是个提高。第一生产队的大车把式康玉林，干劲足，过春节也不休息。有人问他：“怎么大年初一还套车？”他说：“呆着也是呆着，干部老表扬俺，俺就更得好好地干啦！”“你为什么干？”他说：“干活吃饭呗！”这句话反映了他为革命劳动的观点还不明确。为了提高他的思想觉悟，就辅导他学习《为人民服务》。康玉林慢慢地认识到，喂牲口、使牲口，都是为了集体，不是为挣工分吃饭或落个好名声。他的劳动劲头更足了。人们再问他时，他回答：“咱这也是干革命哩。”
    善于引导群众由小看大，把每件事情都要和国家和全世界人民革命联系起来。大里边包括小，如果只追求小，就会把大忘记了。辅导群众学习，要立足于全国、全世界，不能单讲一个生产队如何，王克桥如何。这样，才能把农民的觉悟不断地提高到新的更高的水平。
    六、培养学习积极分子
    我们培养了各种类型的学习积极分子，有老年，有青年，有带孩子的妇女，有干部，有社员，有饲养员，有使役员，有夫妻俩学习好的，也有全家红。这样，大家学有榜样，赶有目标。我们还经常召集这些人交流经验，带动大家，提高自己。
    七、辅导方法要灵活
    农民识字很少，有些人还不识字，怎么学？是念好，还是讲好？有时候给他们只念原文，他们听不进去；有时候解释很多，他们听不出哪些话是毛主席说的。我们逐渐摸索到一种做法，就是辅导员事先弄清文章的大意、确定讲哪几个问题、让群众学后达到什么要求，然后根据当时群众的思想问题，确定让他们重点学习哪一部分较合适。给农民讲的时候，把毛主席的观点亮明，说明哪是毛主席说的，哪是我们补充解释的。补充解释要恰如其分，目的是让农民群众更好地理解毛泽东思想。
    八、辅导员要当群众的学生
    我们村的辅导员多是知识青年。他们学习热情，工作积极，弱点是实际斗争经验少。我们就要这些青年辅导员虚心向农民学习，先当群众的学生。比如，有些青年辅导员不懂得什么叫减租减息，就叫他们去请教老贫农和老下中农。他们再讲这个问题的时候，就满带阶级感情，群众反映讲得好，听得懂。
    九、干部带头学，党支部书记更要带头学
    社会主义革命和建设，靠毛泽东思想作指导，离开毛泽东思想就会犯错误。学习毛主席著作，不能有时学，有时不学，必须经常学。我们除了解决认识问题以外，还强调头头学。这个头头就是党支部书记。党支部书记以身作则，带动其他干部学习。干部首先学习好，才能领导群众学习好。
    我们认为，活学活用毛主席著作的过程，就是一场破资产阶级思想、兴无产阶级思想的斗争过程。学不学毛主席著作，就是要不要革命、要不要社会主义的问题。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，将社会主义革命进行到底，就得要学习一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子，革命一辈子。组织农民学习毛主席著作的根本问题，是要从农民特点出发，紧紧结合三大革命的实际，抓活思想，在用字上狠下功夫；学的目的是为了用，用好了就能鼓舞群众更高的学习热情。
