    Editor's Note: "Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of world revolution." "Mao Zedong's works emit a myriad of rays, illuminating the revolutionary path of the world's people." "Mao Zedong Thought is the sun that never sets." Revolutionary people in various countries, in different languages, have expressed their infinite love for Chairman Mao Zedong and their boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the thought for liberation of all oppressed nations and oppressed people of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism creatively developed in the long practice of the Chinese revolution, and Marxism-Leninism creatively developed in the great struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries in our time. It is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism.
    Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest genius of our time. Revolutionary leaders who have experienced struggles as long, as complex, as intense, and as multifaceted as those experienced by Comrade Mao Zedong are rare in history. Comrade Mao Zedong stands the highest, sees the farthest, observes problems the deepest, discovers them the quickest, and solves them the most thoroughly. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the greatest wealth of the Chinese people but also the common wealth of the world's revolutionary people.
    Wherever Mao Zedong Thought shines, the people there have the direction to strive for liberation and the hope for revolutionary victory. Mao Zedong Thought has given them the strength, wisdom, courage, and confidence to struggle. As Mao Zedong Thought spreads more and more widely throughout the world, the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed and exploited people will unfold even more vigorously. The lifespan of imperialism will not be long.
    In our interviews around the world, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, from Asia, Africa, and Latin America to Europe, we have felt the deep friendship of the people of various countries for the Chinese people wherever we have gone. However, what particularly excites and remains unforgettable for us is the heartfelt love of the people of all countries for our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and their boundless love for Mao Zedong's works. When we meet friends from various countries, many of them first ask about Chairman Mao's health and wish Chairman Mao a long life. They say: "Chairman Mao's good health is the happiness of the world's revolutionary people!" The most precious gift they hope to receive from us is often a copy of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" or a silk portrait of Chairman Mao. They read the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" again and again, never tiring of it; they gaze at Chairman Mao's portrait for a long time, reluctant to put it down. Some friends, gazing at Chairman Mao's embroidered portrait, say to us emotionally: "You are the happiest people because you have such a great leader as Mao Zedong! We are also very happy because we have made friends with the Chinese people educated by Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong belongs to you, and he also belongs to us, he belongs to all the revolutionary people of the world!"
    During our days of interviewing abroad, the vivid facts we have heard and witnessed show that our beloved leader Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the people of all nationalities in our country but also the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism of our time, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly showing its brilliant light in today's surging revolutionary struggles of the world's people, illuminating the hearts of the world's revolutionary people and guiding them to the road of revolutionary victory.
      Thoroughly Defeat the Enemy with the Magic Weapon of People's War
    So many vivid stories churn in our minds, so many touching scenes reappear before our eyes. Dear readers, perhaps you have read many stories of heroic sons and daughters of South Vietnam, but did you know that many of them are fighting the heinous American aggressors with Chairman Mao's works in hand?
    On the battlefields of war-torn South Vietnam, whether in the primitive forests of high mountains or in the boundless plains of the liberated areas, we have visited many outstanding guerrilla units. They carry out people's war, constantly attacking and annihilating the enemy. They are good at ambush warfare, mine warfare, bamboo spike warfare, hornet warfare, etc. They have absorbed the experience of the Chinese revolutionary war from Chairman Mao's works and are constantly creating and developing in their own struggles, beating the American aggressors black and blue. Their victorious struggles prove Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. A famous guerrilla unit we visited near Highway 1 in central South Vietnam carried out more than 150 battles in one year. In one ambush, they annihilated an enemy convoy traveling on the highway in just a few minutes and captured an American "advisor." The members of this guerrilla unit are very familiar with Chairman Mao's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue," and they use it very well in battle. A cultural troupe of the Liberation Army even turned the sixteen-character formula into a performance to be performed for the military and civilians in the liberated areas so that they could better understand and master it.
    We will always remember a night spent in the dense forests of the Truong Son Mountains in South Vietnam. That night, a unit of the Liberation Army held a bonfire party for us. As night enveloped the jungle, a roaring bonfire blazed. The soldiers clapped, sang, and celebrated the victory of the battle. At the beginning of the party, a young soldier stood up and said: "First, let us express our warm greetings to Chairman Mao through the Chinese comrades." The venue immediately erupted in warm applause. We told them that Chairman Mao was in good health and that he had recently attended a rally in Tiananmen Square to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. At this time, the entire venue immediately erupted in thunderous applause once again. A female soldier stood up and said: "Thank you, Chairman Mao, thank you to the Chinese people for your care and support, and wish Uncle Mao a long life, leading the Chinese people from victory to greater victory." At this time, the soldiers clapped enthusiastically once again and sang the song "Liberate the South" while clapping their hands.
    We have passed through many "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam that have just been destroyed by the masses, and we have also visited many combat villages. In one place, a cadre introduced her struggle experience to us, saying that when the enemy was building "strategic hamlets" everywhere in 1961, she and her comrades tried every means to get rid of the "strategic hamlets." At that time, she went to participate in an important meeting convened by a higher level to study the instructions of the higher level and discuss how to act. During the meeting, she studied the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and was inspired by the article "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." She said, "I especially noticed the issue of mobilizing and arming the peasants." Later, she and her comrades led the peasant masses in a coastal province to vigorously carry out the struggle to destroy "strategic hamlets," achieving brilliant victories. She said to us excitedly: "We must use the magic weapon of people's war to thoroughly defeat the enemy."
      Chairman Mao's Works Have Given Them Infinite Strength
    In Laos, known as the "Land of Jungles," we have not only been to Khang Khay and Xiangkhouang, but also visited the front-line fortifications and artillery positions of the war and been guests in farmers' homes in the mountains. We saw that almost every family here has a portrait of Chairman Mao. The office of the Patriotic Forces Command in Xiangkhouang Region has more than a dozen portraits of Chairman Mao, and the homes of responsible people from all walks of life in Xiangkhouang City have portraits of Chairman Mao. Our great and wise leader! You fought alongside the Laotian people, and also engaged in production and labor alongside them. Your works have become their most powerful fighting weapon, and the brilliant light of your great thoughts has illuminated their path to victory, giving them infinite strength. The Laotian friends' endless words of gratitude for Chairman Mao and their boundless love and admiration still resonate in our ears and appear before our eyes.
    The person in charge of the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces told reporters: "Under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have accumulated rich experience in struggle and have now become the strongest pillar of the world's people's revolutionary struggle and the backing of the world's people against American imperialism." He said: "In the struggle, we must distinguish who is the enemy and who is the friend. We must distinguish who is the true friend, who is the false friend, and who is the most steadfast and effective friend." "This is the understanding we have gained from Chairman Mao Zedong's works." The person in charge of the Khang Khay "Liberation Army Daily" has been studying Chairman Mao's works every day since 1962 without interruption and insists on writing his thoughts on his studies. He believes that he can draw infinite strength from Chairman Mao's works, clarify his thoughts, and strengthen his fighting spirit. He told reporters: "Now we place the hope of world revolution on the Chinese Communist Party, especially Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time." He said excitedly to Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao's works have given us great help. We must, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, truly revolutionize ourselves and train ourselves to be strong revolutionary fighters and carry the revolution through to the end forever."
    People from all walks of life in the Lao liberated areas have a very strong desire to study Mao Zedong's works. Not long ago, Khang Khay transported 600 copies of separate editions of Mao Zedong's works in Thai. It happened that the two Lao patriotic forces were holding a cadre meeting here that day, and the heads of various administrative departments and armed forces, as well as the heads of Xiangkhouang Province and counties, participated. This batch of Mao Zedong's works was directly transported to the meeting place, and the meeting place immediately caused a sensation. The participants expressed joy and excitement: "The truth has come!" "This is the most welcome gift!" The person in charge of Xiangkhouang Province, who had just returned from a visit to China, repeatedly requested that he be given more copies. He said: "The cadres there have long entrusted me to bring back some Mao Zedong's works, and they are all eager to learn." A representative of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front constantly told everyone on the spot: "These books are very precious, and everyone should take them back and study them carefully." He also instructed the people who distributed the books to give priority to the troops.
    We have visited the heroic Phou Kout Mountain front line in Laos. How much the soldiers and civilians fighting there love Chairman Mao! Whether on the radio or in speeches, whenever they heard the name Mao Zedong, they could not help but cheer: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Three combat heroes, pointing to the shining Chairman Mao badges on their chests, said to us: "The Chairman Mao badge is the best gift for us. Even in times of intense combat, we must protect it well, and we will never let anything tarnish the great Chairman Mao!" We also heard such a touching story: In one battle, people found a notebook from the belongings of a gloriously sacrificed soldier. On the first page of the notebook was a picture of Chairman Mao cut from a pictorial, and behind the picture was written: "Chairman Mao, we love you!"
        Going into Battle with Mao Zedong's Works
    The surging revolutionary tide is sweeping across the vast African continent. Africa has awakened, Africa is fighting, and the bugle of revolution is resounding throughout Africa. Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, revolutionary Africa is with you!
    Unforgettable memories have brought us back to the Congo (Brazzaville). During the "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, the awakened and fighting Congolese women held a grand parade on this day to celebrate the festival of working women around the world. The crowd marched mightily through the streets of this African city, which had been trampled by the iron hooves of colonialism, chanting slogans to fight to the end for freedom and liberation. The enthusiasm of the masses burst forth, and their fighting spirit was high. Suddenly, an even more exciting scene appeared. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao, carried by the fighting Congolese women, was surrounded and walked past. At this time, people cheered, people applauded, and the slogan "Long live Mao Zedong!" resounded through the sky above the entire city. Seeing this moving scene in Africa, thousands of miles away from our motherland, how could we not be moved to tears?
    The fighters of the patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Leopoldville), who are engaged in a fierce battle with the new and old colonialists headed by American imperialism, are going into battle with Mao Zedong's works, arming themselves with Mao Zedong's theory of people's war. A person in charge of a guerrilla team in the Congo (Leopoldville) told reporters: "Chairman Mao's works have become compulsory reading for Congolese guerrillas, and they regard it as a treasure." When the guerrillas rest, they gather together to study and discuss the works of this great Marxist-Leninist. The guerrillas said: "Mao Zedong seems to have been to Africa, otherwise why does every sentence in his works seem to be written for us."
    In Algeria, which has experienced more than seven years of national liberation war, how deeply rooted Chairman Mao's thought is, whether in the years of fierce fighting or in the post-independence reconstruction period! What is forever unforgettable is that, on those front lines in the deep mountains and dense forests, reporters once met many officers and soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation Army, who were so familiar with Chairman Mao's military thought. On the first night of our first visit to the eastern front of Algeria, we found a book on Chairman Mao's "Sixteen-Character Formula" on the head of a bed of an officer of the General Staff. Once, in the office of a political commissar in a National Liberation Army camp in the border area, we saw four volumes of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in French. On the desk of this political commissar, we also found that in Chairman Mao's famous book "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," people had written lines of small characters in Arabic. In those days, it was not easy to obtain a copy of Chairman Mao's works on the Algerian front. Sometimes they even had to indirectly find Chairman Mao's discussion on people's war from some books about China written by French authors.
    Once, a reporter spent the night at the home of a man named Briki, who told the reporter about his experience in understanding the experience of guerrilla warfare in the Kabylie Mountains. He said that when the commanders in these mountainous areas talked about their struggles, they always repeatedly emphasized: "This is Mao Zedong's theory," "This is what Mao Zedong said"...
    After Algeria's independence, articles on studying and introducing Mao Zedong Thought were often published in newspapers and magazines. Chairman Mao's works were spread more widely, and more people read Chairman Mao's works. Hundreds of thousands of copies of Chairman Mao's works were sold out in Algeria.
    Recognized the Truth that "Political Power Grows Out of the Barrel of a Gun"
    In Zanzibar, the heroic people there rose up in armed revolution in January 1964, seizing weapons from the enemy with axes, machetes, wooden sticks, and iron rods, and overthrew the feudal reactionary rule that had been supported by imperialism for a long time. When many revolutionary fighters who participated in the armed uprising talked to us about this victory, they often thanked the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and thanked Chairman Mao's works for making many of them realize the truth. They quoted Chairman Mao's words: Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Anything reactionary, if you don't hit it, it won't fall. After the victory of the revolution, the people of Zanzibar held their guns tightly, maintained a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and strictly guarded against the enemy's subversion plot. Many people quoted Chairman Mao's words: The enemy is not willing to fail. As long as the imperialists hold knives in their hands, we must also pick up knives according to their methods and never fall asleep.
    A member of parliament in Somalia, when talking about his feelings after reading Chairman Mao's article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," said: After reading this article, he clarified who is the enemy, who is the friend, and understood the importance of relying on, uniting, and cultivating the backbone of the national liberation struggle in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist national liberation united front. He felt clear-headed and bright-eyed and strengthened his confidence and determination in the national revolution. He described his mood when reading this article as: Like a bright lamp lit in the long dark night, instantly illuminating the road ahead.
    Chairman Mao's works currently enjoy the same high reputation among many freedom fighters in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Azania. These African sons and daughters, who are fighting bravely for their national independence and liberation cause, are increasingly realizing from their own personal experience that armed struggle is the only correct way for them to achieve victory, and they have recognized the universal truth put forward by Chairman Mao that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and his brilliant exposition on the people's army and people's war. Therefore, many of them often hope to receive a copy of Chairman Mao's military works when they meet Chinese friends.
    The fighters in "Portuguese" Guinea, who are carrying out armed struggle for national liberation against the colonial rule of the Portuguese colonialists, carry Chairman Mao's military works with them, studying and fighting at the same time. They applied Chairman Mao's theory of people's war, established vast revolutionary base areas in the countryside of "Portuguese" Guinea, established militia, guerrillas, and regular troops, carried out guerrilla warfare, and constantly attacked and annihilated the enemy, besieging the Portuguese colonialists in a few cities, and achieved great victories. In 1964, a reporter met Alfa Diallo, the deputy commander of a military region of the patriotic armed forces of Portuguese Guinea, and gave him a Chairman Mao badge. He embraced the reporter warmly and said that this was what he had hoped for for many years and that he would show the badge to his comrades on the front line.
      Chairman Mao's Works are Required Reading for Revolutionaries
    We have also visited Latin America. People know that on this vast continent, which has always been called the "backyard of the United States," the flame of national liberation struggle is in full swing. It is also on this continent that we have seen the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. In February 1963, a shocking event shook the entire Western world. This was that nine patriotic youths from Venezuela armedly seized the giant ship "Anzoátegui" and, with a spirit of great fearlessness, overcame the interception of American warships and planes and sailed the ship to Brazil. A month after the incident, we met the Venezuelan heroes who seized the ship at an international conference in Brazil. At that time, Jesus, the temporary captain of the ship during the seizure battle, told us about the battle. Naturally, listening to the thrilling ship seizure battle made us express infinite admiration for the courageous spirit of the Venezuelan youths, but what we still cannot forget is the Venezuelan revolutionaries' ardent and deep feelings for the Chinese people and our great leader. Before we bid farewell to Jesus, we pinned a jujube-red Tiananmen badge on his chest. He said happily: "Great, this is exactly what I wanted to ask you for. After returning to Venezuela, whether in the mountains or on the plains, I will wear it on my chest every time I fight. I want to tell my comrades: I have met Chinese comrades, shook hands with them, and talked to them. Our Venezuelan revolutionary soldiers have always had a high respect for Chinese comrades. Because we know that revolutionary China, with nearly 700 million people, is the strongest force supporting our struggle, and we are proud to have such strong comrades like China." He continued: "In Venezuela, no one does not know Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong's works have become the most common compulsory reading material for Venezuelan revolutionaries." He then held our hands tightly and said: "Please convey to the great Comrade Mao Zedong and the great Chinese people the respect of all the Venezuelan people."
    In other countries in Latin America, the revolutionary people are also eagerly studying the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism of our time – Mao Zedong Thought. When we met with a group of progressive youths in Chile, they often talked about studying Mao Zedong's works. They said that because they are usually busy with work, they often study collectively on Sundays. With revolutionary passion, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" in light of the specific situation in Chile. Once, one of them told us that Chairman Mao said that to see whether a youth is revolutionary, you have to see whether he is willing and implements the combination with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Therefore, Chilean revolutionaries should first go to the masses of workers and peasants and combine with them. He also mentioned that after studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized that when Chilean Marxists engage in a united front with national bourgeoisie figures, they must maintain independence and autonomy in the united front and maintain leadership in the united front. During our stay in Chile, Ana, the chairman of the Chile-China Friendship Association, often talked to us about her yearning for China. Recently, she finally came to China to visit, realizing her long-cherished wish. As soon as she got off the plane, she asked us to convey her greetings to Chairman Mao. She said: The great revolutionary image of China has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Chilean people, and nothing can separate the Chilean people's sincere feelings and unparalleled love for the beloved Chairman Mao and the Chinese people.
      Mao Zedong Gave Them Inspiration and Confidence
    In Brazil, which has an area of more than 8 million square kilometers, from south to north, people have often heard people asking: "China is a big country, and Brazil is also a big country. China has been liberated, why has Brazil not been liberated? Why can China defeat Chiang Kai-shek's 8 million troops armed by the United States, and directly defeat the American ace troops in Korea, while we Brazilians are still being ravaged by the claws of the United States?" Many Brazilians themselves answered: "This is because China has a great Marxist-Leninist Communist Party, because China has a great people's leader Mao Zedong!" Whether in the city or in the countryside, as soon as the Brazilian people knew that we were reporters from Beijing, they enthusiastically reached out their hands and said: "Welcome to you, friends from Mao Zedong's country!" They often surrounded us to inquire about the construction of new China and wish Chairman Mao good health. In Belo Horizonte, an elderly man named Jaime, whom we did not know originally, insisted on inviting us to his home to meet a large group of relatives and friends he had made an appointment with. When we entered the hall, they all stood up, the record player played the song "The East is Red," and the elderly man Jaime said: "We would like to take this opportunity to express our welcome to the new China, to Chairman Mao Zedong, and to friends from the country we yearn for!" The Portuguese version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published in Brazil. Before the Brazilian coup in 1964, separate editions of Chairman Mao's works were widely sold in various cities. In the philosophy department of some universities, students voluntarily organized to study Chairman Mao's philosophical works, and they used Mao Zedong Thought to launch fierce debates with local Khrushchev elements. The working people of Brazil especially love Chairman Mao. Once, a Brazilian worker bought a "People's Pictorial" with a portrait of Chairman Mao. He cherished the portrait of Chairman Mao from it and said to the reporter: "I want to frame it and hang it up. I admire Mao Zedong very much!"
    In some schools in Mexico, study groups of Chairman Mao's works have been established. Mexican people said: "American imperialism is the number one enemy of the people of the world. We Mexicans feel this especially deeply. American imperialism has occupied half of our country's territory, and we will never forget this debt!" At a reception for Chinese guests attended by dozens of Mexican friends, a Mexican girl stood up and recited a passionate poem she wrote herself to the Chinese guests. One section of it said:
    We look to the East,
    The dawn has risen.
    Who gives us inspiration,
    Who gives us confidence?
    Mao Zedong – we know your name,
    We admire you.
    When visiting Ecuador, we once visited the home of a leader of an Indian organization in northeastern Ecuador. When we arrived at his home, it was completely dark. This leader, like other Indians, was a farmhand, farming for the landlord. He lived in a small, dome-shaped thatched house, and his whole family lived with cows, sheep, and chickens. When he heard that Chinese guests had arrived, he enthusiastically came out to welcome us, and Indians of all sizes from other thatched houses nearby also came out to welcome us. They shook hands and hugged us warmly, calling us brothers. This leader said that although we have never met Chinese brothers, we have always heard news of Chinese brothers and know that you have been liberated under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and have built a strong country. He lit the only small oil lamp (Indians are extremely poor and generally do not light lamps easily) and invited us to sit down on the floor next to the cow. They enthusiastically wanted us to talk about how the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, overthrew the Chiang Kai-shek clique and overthrew the landlords and bureaucratic capitalists. They listened to our talk with excitement and kept asking questions. When they heard that the Chinese peasants had overthrown the landlords through struggle, distributed the land, and organized themselves to establish people's communes, everyone was very happy and excited. This leader said, "The Chinese people love Chairman Mao, and we Indians also love Chairman Mao. Chinese brothers are our example. We also want to turn over and seek liberation like the Chinese peasants."
      Mao Zedong Thought Shook the Capitalist World
    The Chinese people still remember the words full of fighting passion of the American black leader Robert Williams when he visited China a few years ago. It was this American black leader who regarded Chairman Mao's statement supporting the American black people's struggle as a treasure, printed it in large letters in the magazine he edited himself, and sent it to black brothers in the United States and Africa. It was this American black leader who hung a Chairman Mao photo signed by Chairman Mao in his living room and often talked eloquently about his unforgettable meeting with Chairman Mao. In Cuba, we met him more than once, and he often talked to us about how Chairman Mao's idea in the statement that the national problem is the class struggle problem inspired him and the American black people's struggle. Once, when he heard the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries attacking China, he immediately refuted them. Afterwards, he said to us angrily: "Who supports us most resolutely? Our black brothers know best: Chairman Mao Zedong supports the struggle of our black brothers around the world most resolutely!"
    The success of the Chinese Pavilion at the Paris Exposition shows how much the French people love New China and how much they admire Chairman Mao! At that time, the people visiting the Chinese exhibition hall were constantly flowing, and there were crowds of people every day. After seeing the exhibition, many people were encouraged by China's achievements. Some people compared seeing the Chinese Pavilion to "seeing the hope of our youth," and some people said: "The Chinese are great, they are really an example." Some people wrote such slogans on the guestbook: "Long live China, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" Once, a Chinese performance team performed in an ancient city in France. After watching the performance, an old lady came forward and hoped that the performance team would give her a Chairman Mao badge. When her wish was fulfilled, she looked at the badge carefully, looked at it again, was very happy, and hugged the Chinese actor who gave her the badge tightly. Later, in the second performance, the old lady appeared in the audience again. This old lady said again that she had another daughter and hoped to get another Chairman Mao badge... When the Chinese art troupe visited Bologna, Italy, they were often approached by some people on the street asking if they were from China. After they were confirmed, they happily gave a thumbs up and said: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" Once, the Chinese art troupe visited Florence, a famous cultural city. In a famous art gallery, an old lady with white hair was copying a famous painting. When she knew that these guests were from China, she looked at the art troupe members with a look full of infinite affection and repeatedly praised: "China, what a beautiful place! China, Mao Zedong's hometown!" The words of the French friend Marie-José expressed the aspirations of the revolutionary people. This French friend said:
 "What I especially like are the works of your great leader Mao Zedong, because I love and respect him very much." "I am very willing to study Mao Zedong Thought. Because he is a great man, a truly loyal anti-imperialist. His great thought shook the capitalist world, especially American imperialism."
      Mao Zedong is the Great Helmsman of World Revolution
    From one continent of the world to another, the revolutionary people, although there are differences in nationality, language, and skin color, their love for Chairman Mao is common, and their urgent desire to study Chairman Mao's works is also common. There is no need to describe here the deep revolutionary feelings of the heroic Albanian people who hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism for Chairman Mao, and there is no need to describe the love of the people of North Korea and Vietnam, who share life and death with us, for our great leader, which is well known to everyone. We cannot forget a progressive friend in Burma, whose feelings for New China are so deep and whose respect for our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong is so great. He once said: "Beijing is a symbol of world revolution, Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of world revolution, and Mao Zedong's works emit a myriad of rays, illuminating the road of world people's revolution. Those who want to make revolution must carefully read Chairman Mao's books!" We also cannot forget a group of young people in Tokyo, Japan, who organized the "Mao Zedong Thought Research Association" from January 1964, stipulating that they would gather once a week to collectively study Chairman Mao's works, and have persisted for more than two years. Not long ago, these Japanese youths talked to us about some of their experiences in studying Mao Zedong Thought. A female student studying Chinese literature at a university in Tokyo said that the intermediate zone theory put forward by Chairman Mao is completely correct. The most fundamental point of the idea that American imperialism is a paper tiger is to believe in the power of the people. A Japanese youth said that the road that China has traveled and is traveling under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong provides an example for the people of the world. Today, it is impossible for the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to take the capitalist road, while China's road of building socialism through self-reliance points a direction to the people. A young man who is engaged in scientific research at a university said that Chairman Mao is not only a great politician and military strategist but also a great scientist. Chairman Mao Zedong's proposal of the three major revolutionary tasks of class struggle, struggle for production, and scientific experiment is very wise.
    When we talked with revolutionary friends from various countries about the vigorous development and great victories of the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, and national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, these friends often linked the reasons for the victories with accepting the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Swedish writer Jan Myrdal pointed out in an article commenting on "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" that Mao Zedong is a great commander, his greatness is undeniable, and even his opponents have long seen this. His works provide revolutionaries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America with a theoretical basis for revolutionary wars that are being waged or will be launched.
    It is precisely because of this that the revolutionary people of various countries study Mao Zedong's works with strong revolutionary feelings. Many people, regardless of the danger to their lives, look everywhere for Chairman Mao's works and read them secretly; even more people mimeograph or transcribe Chairman Mao's works in sections and pass them on to others. Many revolutionary heroes have not stopped reading Chairman Mao's books even in enemy prisons. A captured revolutionary in Venezuela found two copies of Chairman Mao's works for his fellow prisoners. Because there were so many people and so few books, they divided into groups to read and discuss them. Some people did not sleep at night and read them by the dim light. We have met many friends whose treasured "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and newspaper clippings containing Chairman Mao's articles are all old and worn out, and they don't know how many times they have read them. They said: Every time they read it, they can get new inspiration from it. Some friends said: "Chairman Mao's books are an endless treasure trove of theory, and to master them, you have to study them every day."
      The Spread of Mao Zedong Thought Cannot be Stopped
    As everyone knows, after the right-wing generals group in Indonesia usurped state power, they carried out a bloody massacre and mass arrest in this country of thousands of islands, and brazenly carried out anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people activities. But even under such a fascist white terror, when we were in Indonesia, we still felt the love of the Indonesian people for the Chinese Communist Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao. In October last year, our reporter returned to Jakarta from Beijing with a plaster statue of Chairman Mao. When some Indonesians saw it at Jakarta Airport, they shouted Mao Zedong's name excitedly. Once, our driver comrade was reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the car. When an Indonesian soldier saw the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover, he gave a thumbs up and said repeatedly: "Mao Zedong, bagus (meaning very good)!" These things, which happened in Indonesia under the white terror, show how far-reaching the influence of the Chinese revolution and Mao Zedong Thought is among the Indonesian people, and this influence cannot be eliminated by the Indonesian reactionaries.
    Here, we must mention the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. There, modern revisionists who betrayed Marxism-Leninism colluded with imperialists and reactionaries of various countries to stir up an anti-China countercurrent. They were afraid of the truth and afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, so they tried every means to block Mao Zedong's works in an attempt to prevent the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the truth cannot be blocked, and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be stopped. The more modern revisionists try to block Mao Zedong's works, the more the people there want to study Mao Zedong's works; the more modern revisionists attack our beloved leader Chairman Mao, the more the people there love Chairman Mao. During our days of interviewing in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, we found that the vast majority of the people there are willing to make revolution, they firmly defend Marxism-Leninism, firmly oppose revisionism, and they place their hopes on the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They said: "Beijing is the lighthouse of world revolution, and Mao Zedong is the helmsman of world revolution."
      Mao Zedong Thought is the Sun That Never Sets
    Thousands of words cannot express the love of the people of various countries for Chairman Mao and their yearning for Chairman Mao's works. Wherever we go, when people know that we are from New China, they give a thumbs up and cheer "Mao Zedong!" When they see an item from China, they also shout "Mao Zedong!" When people watch Chinese movies and see Chairman Mao appearing on the screen, they immediately burst into long-lasting thunderous applause, and some people shout "Long live Mao Zedong!" The Lao patriotic fighters fighting on the Phou Kout Mountain front line take "Long live Mao Zedong!" as one of the fighting slogans to encourage morale on the front line. We cannot forget the touching scene when the China Exhibition was held in Somalia in November 1965. At that time, Somalis in groups took photos in front of the huge portrait of Chairman Mao, and people scrambled to ask for Chairman Mao badges, and those who got them proudly wore them on their chests. Many viewers wrote passionately in the guestbook: "Salute to Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong, thank you for pointing out the direction for us!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" We once met a singer from Guinea who enthusiastically sang his own song "Fighting Africa Sings of Mao Zedong and His Great Cause" on stage. He said that although he had never met Chairman Mao, he could not help but sing praises to Chairman Mao. He said that Chairman Mao's works are infinite power; Chairman Mao's thought is the sun that never sets! He said that in Africa, he would dedicate this song to his black brothers; if in Europe and America, he would sing to his white brothers. He wants to "

    毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着全世界
    编者按：“毛泽东是世界革命的伟大舵手。”“毛泽东著作发出万道光芒，照亮了世界人民革命的道路。”“毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳。”世界各国革命人民，用不同的语言，表达了他们对毛泽东主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限景仰。
    毛泽东思想是当代一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民谋解放的思想。毛泽东思想是在中国革命的长期实践中创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义，是在当代各国人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的伟大斗争中创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义。它是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的天才。象毛泽东同志经历过那样长期、那样复杂、那样激烈、那样多方面斗争的革命领袖，在历史上是罕见的。毛泽东同志站得最高，看得最远，对问题观察得最深，发现得最快，解决得最彻底。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的最大财富，也是世界革命人民的共同财富。
    毛泽东思想照耀到那里，那里的人民就有了争取解放的方向，就有了革命胜利的希望。毛泽东思想给了他们以斗争的力量、智慧、勇气和信心。随着毛泽东思想在全世界越来越广泛的传播，被压迫被剥削的人民的革命斗争就会更加蓬勃地展开。帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。
    在世界各地采访，从太平洋到大西洋，从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲到欧洲，我们所到之处都感受到各国人民对中国人民的深厚友情。然而，特别使我们激动和永志不忘的，却是世界各国人民对我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席的衷心爱戴和他们对毛泽东著作的无限热爱。我们在同各国朋友们会见时，他们当中许多人一见面都首先问候毛主席的身体健康，祝毛主席万寿无疆。他们说：“毛主席身体好，是世界革命人民的幸福！”他们希望从我们手中得到的最珍贵的礼物，往往是一部《毛泽东选集》，或者是一幅毛主席的丝织象。他们对《毛泽东选集》，一读再读，百读不厌；他们久久地端详着毛主席象，爱不释手。有的朋友凝望着毛主席绣象感情激动地对我们说：“你们是最幸福的人，因为你们有毛泽东这样伟大的领袖！我们也很幸福，因为我们同毛泽东教导出来的中国人交上了朋友！毛泽东是属于你们的，也是属于我们的，他是属于全世界革命人民的！”
    在国外采访的日子里，我们耳闻目睹的活生生的事实说明着：我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，不仅是我国各族人民的伟大领袖，而且是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。毛泽东思想在今天风起云涌的世界人民革命斗争中，日益显示出灿烂的光辉，它照亮了世界革命人民的心，为他们指引着革命的胜利道路。
      用人民战争的法宝彻底战胜敌人
    多少生动的故事在我们脑海里翻腾，多少感人的场景又重现在我们的眼前。亲爱的读者们，也许你们已经读过许许多多南越英雄儿女的战斗故事，可是你们可曾知道，他们当中很多人是带着毛主席的著作在同万恶的美国侵略者进行战斗吗？
    在战火纷飞的越南南方的战场上，不论是在高山峻岭的原始森林里，还是在一望无际的平原解放区，我们访问过许多支出色的游击队。他们开展人民战争，不断地打击和消灭敌人。他们善于打袭击战、伏击战、地雷战、竹尖战、马蜂战等等。他们从毛主席的著作中，吸取了中国革命战争的经验，并且在自己的斗争实践中不断创造和发展，把美国侵略者打得头破血流。他们的胜利斗争证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。我们访问过的越南南方中部一号公路旁边的一支著名的游击队，在一年中就进行了一百五十多次战斗。在一次伏击战中，他们仅仅用了几分钟就消灭了行驶在公路上的敌人的一支车队，俘虏了美国“顾问”。这支游击队的成员们对毛主席关于游击战的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的十六字诀，背得很熟，而且在战斗中用得很好。有一个解放军的文工团还把十六字诀编成节目，为解放区军民演出，以便使他们更好地领会和掌握十六字诀。
    我们永远记得在南越长山山脉的密林里度过的一个夜晚。那天晚上解放军的一支部队为我们举行篝火晚会。当夜幕笼罩着丛林时，一堆熊熊的篝火烧起来了。战士们拍着手、唱着歌，庆祝战斗的胜利。晚会开始时，一位青年战士站起来说：“首先让我们通过中国同志向毛主席致以热烈的问候。”会场立即响起热烈的掌声。我们告诉他们说，毛主席身体很健康，他不久以前还出席了在天安门前举行的支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的大会。这时全场立即又一次爆发了雷鸣般的掌声。一位女战士站起来说：“感谢毛主席，感谢中国人民对我们的关怀和支持，祝毛伯伯万寿无疆，领导中国人民从胜利走向更大胜利。”这时战士们又一次热烈鼓掌，并一边拍手一边激昂地高唱《解放南方》的歌曲。
    我们在越南南方走过许多刚刚被人民群众摧毁了的“战略村”，也访问了许多战斗村。在某地，一位干部向我们介绍她的斗争经历时说，在一九六一年敌人到处建立“战略村”时，她和她的战友们就想方设法来搞掉“战略村”。她当时去参加一个上级召开的重要会议，学习上级的指示，讨论如何行动。在会议期间，她学习了《毛泽东选集》，从《湖南农民运动考察报告》那篇文章中得到了启发。她说，“我特别注意到发动和武装农民的问题”。后来，她和她的战友们在沿海的一个省份，领导着农民群众把捣毁“战略村”的斗争轰轰烈烈地开展起来，取得了辉煌的胜利。她激动地对我们说：“我们要用人民战争的法宝来彻底战胜敌人。”
      毛主席著作给了他们无穷的力量
    在以丛林之国著称的老挝，我们不仅到过康开市和川圹市，而且访问过战火纷飞的前线工事和炮兵阵地，也到山区的农家作过客。我们看到，这里差不多家家都挂着毛主席象，川圹地区爱国力量指挥部办公室挂的毛主席象有十几幅，川圹市各界负责人家中都挂着毛主席象。我们伟大而英明的领袖啊！你同老挝人民战斗在一起，也生产劳动在一起，你的著作变成了他们的最有力的战斗武器，你的伟大的思想光辉，照亮了他们的前进的通向胜利的道路，给了他们以无穷的力量。老挝朋友对毛主席的说不尽的感激的话语，道不完的爱戴之情至今仍回响在我们的耳边，浮现在我们的眼前。
    老挝爱国中立力量军事指挥部负责人对记者说：“中国人民在久经考验的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，积累了丰富的斗争经验，今天已成为世界人民革命斗争的最坚强的支柱，是世界人民反对美帝国主义的靠山。”他说：“我们在斗争中一定要分清谁是敌人，谁是朋友。要分清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友，谁是最坚定最得力的朋友。”“这是我们从毛泽东主席的著作中得到的认识。”康开《解放军报》负责人从一九六二年起每天学习毛主席著作，从未间断，并坚持写学习心得。他认为，从毛主席著作中可以汲取无穷的力量，明确思想，坚定斗志。他对记者说：“现在我们把世界革命的希望寄托在中国共产党特别是毛主席的身上。毛泽东是当代的列宁。”他对着毛主席象激动地说：“毛主席著作曾给我们极大帮助，我们要象毛泽东主席所说的，使自己真正革命化，把自己锻炼成一个坚强的革命战士，永远把革命进行到底。”
    老挝解放区各界人士要求学习毛泽东著作的愿望非常强烈。不久前，康开运到六百本泰文版毛泽东著作单行本，这天恰好老挝两支爱国力量在这里举行干部会议，各行政部门和武装部队的负责人以及川圹省、县负责人都参加了。这批毛泽东著作就直接运到了会场，顿时会场轰动，参加会的人欢欣鼓舞地表示：“真理来了！”“这是最受欢迎的礼品！”刚访华回来的川圹省负责人一再请求多给他一部分，他说：“我们那里的干部早就委托我带些毛泽东著作回去，他们都急等着要学呢。”老挝爱国战线党中央的一位代表当场不断嘱咐大家：“这些书非常珍贵，大家拿回去要好好认真学习。”他还指示分发书的人要优先发给部队。
    我们曾到英雄的老挝富科特山前线访问过。战斗在那里的广大军民们是何等地热爱毛主席啊！他们不论是在广播里还是在讲话中，只要听到毛泽东的名字时，就情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”有三位战斗英雄指着他们胸前的闪闪发光的毛主席纪念章对我们说：“毛主席纪念章，是给我们最好的礼品。就是在战斗紧张的时刻里，也要把它保护好，我们决不让任何东西沾污了伟大的毛主席！”我们还听到了这样一个感人的故事：在一次战斗里，人们从一位光荣牺牲的战士的遗物里，发现一个笔记本，在笔记本的第一页上贴着一张从画报上剪下来的毛主席照片，在照片背后写着：“毛主席，我们热爱你！”
        带着毛泽东的著作去战斗
    滚滚的革命巨浪正席卷广阔的非洲大陆。非洲觉醒了，非洲在战斗，革命的号角响遍非洲。我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊，革命的非洲同你在一起！
    难忘的记忆又把我们带到了刚果（布）。今年“三八”节的时候，觉醒了的战斗着的刚果妇女在这一天举行了盛大的游行，欢度这全世界劳动妇女的节日，人群浩浩荡荡地走过这曾被殖民主义者铁蹄践踏过的非洲都市的街道，欢呼着为自由解放而战斗到底的口号，群众热情迸发，斗志昂扬。突然一个更令人激动的场面出现了，一幅毛主席的巨幅画象被战斗的刚果妇女抬着，簇拥着走过来了，这时人们欢呼，人们鼓掌，“毛泽东万岁！”的口号声响彻着整个都市的上空。在离祖国万里之遥的非洲看到这动人的情景，我们又怎么能不激动得热泪盈眶呢？
    正在同以美帝国主义为首的新老殖民主义者进行殊死战斗的刚果（利）的爱国武装的战士们，带着毛主席著作去作战，用毛泽东的人民战争的理论武装自己。刚果（利）的一支游击队负责人告诉记者：“毛主席的著作已成为刚果游击队员的必读物，他们把它视为珍宝。”游击队员在休息的时候，就聚集在一起，学习和讨论这位伟大的马克思列宁主义者的著作。游击队员们说：“毛泽东好象到我们非洲来过，不然为什么他的著作中每一句话都好象是为我们而写的。”
    在经历七年多民族解放战争的阿尔及利亚，无论是激烈战斗的年代还是独立后重建时期，毛主席思想多么深入人心呵！使人永远不能忘怀的是，在那些深山密林的边境前线，记者曾经遇见过许多当年阿尔及利亚民族解放军的军官和战士，他们如此熟悉毛主席的军事思想。当我们初次访问阿尔及利亚东部前线的第一夜，就在总参谋部一位军官的床头上发现一本论述毛主席“十六字诀”的著作。一次，我们在边境地区民族解放军军营的一位政委的办公室里看见四册法文本的《毛泽东选集》。在这位政委的办公桌上，我们还发现在毛主席写的《中国革命战争的战略问题》这本名著里，人们用阿拉伯文注上了一行行小字。在那样的年代，阿尔及利亚前线要得到一本毛主席的著作是不容易的，他们有时甚至不得不间接地从法国一些作者所写的有关中国的著作中去找寻毛主席关于人民战争方面的论述。
    有一次记者在一个名叫布里基的家里过夜，他向记者叙述了他去卡比列山区了解游击战争的经验。他说，这些山区里的指挥官在谈到他们斗争的时候，总是反复地强调说：“这是毛泽东的理论”，“这是毛泽东说过的话”……。
    阿尔及利亚独立之后，在报刊上经常发表有关研究和介绍毛泽东思想的文章，毛主席的著作传播得更广了，读毛主席著作的人更多了，成千上万册毛主席著作在阿尔及利亚畅销一空。
    认识了“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理
    在桑给巴尔，那里的英雄人民在一九六四年一月揭竿而起进行武装革命，用斧头、砍刀、木棍、铁棒从敌人手中夺取武器，一举推翻了长期由帝国主义支持的封建反动统治。许多参加武装起义的革命战士同我们谈起这一胜利经过时，常常感谢毛泽东思想的引导，感谢毛主席著作使他们许多人认识了真理。他们引用毛主席的话说，那里有压迫那里就有反抗。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。革命胜利后，桑给巴尔人民紧握枪杆，保持高度的革命警惕性，严防敌人颠覆阴谋。许多人引用毛主席的话说，敌人是不甘心失败的。只要帝国主义手里拿着刀，我们按照他们的办法也要拿起刀来，决不能睡大觉。
    索马里的一位议员在谈到他读了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文后的感想时说：读了这篇文章，明确了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，懂得了在反帝反殖民族解放统一战线中应该依靠谁，团结谁，和培养民族解放斗争的骨干力量的重要性等革命的首要问题，感到心明眼亮，增强了民族革命的信心和决心。他形容在读这篇文章时的心情是：就象在漫漫的黑夜里燃起了一盏明灯，霎时照亮了前进的道路。
    毛主席的著作目前在莫三鼻给、津巴布韦、安哥拉和阿扎尼亚的许多自由战士中，同样享有崇高的声誉。这些正在为自己民族独立解放事业进行英勇斗争的非洲儿女们从自己切身体验中越来越认识到武装斗争是他们夺取胜利的唯一正确的道路，认识了毛主席提出的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一普遍真理和关于人民军队、人民战争的英明论述。因而他们中间许多人遇到中国朋友时希望得到的礼物常常是一部毛主席的军事著作。
    正在为反对葡萄牙殖民主义者的殖民统治争取民族解放而进行武装斗争的“葡属”几内亚的战士们，身上携带着毛主席的军事著作，一边学习一边战斗。他们运用了毛主席人民战争的理论，在“葡属”几内亚的农村建立了广大的革命根据地，建立了民兵、游击队和正规军，开展游击战，不断打击消灭敌人，把葡萄牙殖民主义者围困在少数的城市里，取得了很大的胜利。记者在一九六四年会见了葡属几内亚爱国武装的一个军区的副司令阿尔发·迪亚洛，赠给了他一枚毛主席纪念章。他同记者热烈地拥抱，他说，这是他多年想望的，他将把这枚纪念章给他在前线的战友们看。
      毛主席著作是革命者的必读教材
    我们也曾经到拉丁美洲访问过。人们知道，一向被称为“美国后院”的这个广阔的大洲，民族解放斗争的火焰正方兴未艾。就在这个大洲上，我们也看到了毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。一九六三年二月，有一个惊人的事件，曾经轰动了整个西方世界。这就是九位委内瑞拉的爱国青年，武装夺取了“安索亚特吉”号巨轮，并以大无畏的精神，战胜了美国军舰、飞机的拦截，把轮船驶到巴西。在事情发生的一个月后，我们在巴西的一个国际会议上，遇见了夺取这艘船的委内瑞拉勇士们。当时夺船战斗中的临时船长赫索斯向我们讲述了战斗的经过。自然，听着那惊心动魄的夺船战斗使我们对委内瑞拉青年们的勇敢精神表示无限的敬佩，但使我们至今难忘的却是委内瑞拉革命志士对中国人民和我们的伟大领袖那炽烈的深厚感情。在同赫索斯握别之前，我们把一枚枣红色的天安门纪念章别在他的胸前。他高兴地说：“好极了，这正是我想跟你们要的。回到委内瑞拉之后，无论在山区，在平原，每逢战斗的时候，我都要把它戴在胸前。我要告诉我的战友们：我见过中国同志了，同他们握过手，谈过话了。我们委内瑞拉革命战士对中国同志一向怀着崇高的敬意。因为我们知道，近七亿人口的革命的中国，是支持我们斗争的最坚强的力量，我们以有象中国这样坚强的战友感到骄傲。”他接着说：“在委内瑞拉，没有一个人不知道毛泽东同志的。毛泽东同志的著作，已成为委内瑞拉革命者最普遍的必读的教材。”他又紧紧地拉着我们的手说：“谨通过你们，向伟大的毛泽东同志，向伟大的中国人民，表达全体委内瑞拉人民的敬意。”
    在拉丁美洲的其他国家，革命的人民同样是如饥如渴地学习当代最高最活的马列主义——毛泽东思想。我们在智利同一批进步青年相聚的时候，他们经常谈起学习毛泽东著作问题。他们说，由于平时工作忙，他们常常在星期天集体学习。他们怀着革命激情，联系智利的具体情况，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》等著作。有一次，他们当中的一位告诉我们，毛主席说过，看一个青年是不是革命的，就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。因此智利的革命者首先应当到工农群众中间去，同他们结合在一块。他还谈到，学习了毛主席著作以后认识到，智利的马克思主义者在同民族资产阶级人士搞统一战线时，一定要保持在统一战线中的独立自主，要保持在统一战线中的领导权。当我们在智利逗留的日子里，智中文协主席安娜常常同我们谈起她对中国的向往。最近她终于来到中国访问，实现了她梦寐以求的愿望。她一下飞机就要我们转达她对毛主席的问候。她说：中国伟大革命形象已深深地烙印在智利人民的心中，没有任何东西可以分隔智利人民对敬爱的毛主席和中国人民的真挚感情和无比热爱。
      毛泽东给他们启示，给他们信心
    在面积达八百多万平方公里的巴西，从南到北，曾经常常听到人们在问：“中国是一个大国，巴西也是一个大国，中国解放了，为什么巴西没有解放？为什么中国能够打败美国武装的八百万蒋介石军队，又在朝鲜直接把美国王牌军打得落花流水，而我们巴西，还在美国的魔爪蹂躏下？”许多巴西人自己回答说：“这是因为中国有一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的共产党，因为中国有一位伟大的人民领袖毛泽东！”无论在城市或乡村，巴西人民一经知道我们是从北京来的记者，都热情地伸出手来说：“欢迎你们，来自毛泽东的国家的朋友！”他们经常围着我们询问新中国的建设情况，祝愿毛泽东主席身体健康。在贝洛岳里逊德，一位原不相识的名叫查伊梅的老人坚持把我们请到他家去同他约好的一大群亲友相见，当我们走进大厅的时候，他们全体起立，电唱机放出了《东方红》歌曲，查伊梅老人说：“我们谨借此表达对新中国、对毛泽东主席、对来自我们所向往的国家的朋友的欢迎！”巴西已经出版了葡文的《毛泽东选集》，在一九六四年巴西政变之前，毛主席著作的单行本在各城市销行得很普遍。有的大学的哲学系，学生们主动组织起来研究毛主席的哲学著作，他们纷纷运用毛主席思想，同当地的赫鲁晓夫分子展开激烈的论战。巴西的劳动人民特别热爱毛主席。有一次，一位巴西工人买到了一本带有毛主席象的《人民画报》，他珍惜地把其中的毛主席象剪下，并对记者说：“我要去镶上镜框，把它挂起来，我非常敬仰毛泽东！”
    在墨西哥的一些学校，成立了毛主席著作的学习小组。墨西哥人士说：“美帝国主义是世界人民的头号敌人，这句话我们墨西哥人体会尤深。美帝国主义侵占了我国半壁河山，我们决不会忘记这笔账！”在有几十名墨西哥友人参加的欢迎中国客人的酒会上，一位墨西哥少女站出来向中国客人们朗诵了她自己写的热情的诗篇。其中有一段这样说：
    我们仰望东方，
    曙光已经升起。
    是谁给我们启示，
    是谁给我们信心？
    毛泽东——我们熟悉你的名字，
    我们敬仰你。
    在访问厄瓜多尔的时候，我们曾到厄瓜多尔东北部的一个印第安人组织的领导人家里作客。到他家里的时候，天已完全黑了。这个领导人同其他印第安人一样，是一个雇农，给庄园主种地。他住在一个矮小的圆顶的茅草房子里，全家同牛、羊、鸡住在一起。他听到中国客人来到的时候，热情地出门来欢迎我们，附近其他一些茅草房的印第安人大大小小也都出来欢迎我们。他们同我们热烈握手、拥抱，称我们是兄弟，这个领导人说，我们虽然没有见过中国兄弟，但是一直听到中国兄弟的消息，知道你们在毛泽东主席的领导下获得了解放，并且建设了强大的国家。他点起了唯一的一盏小油灯（印第安人极为贫困，一般不轻易点灯的），邀请我们在牛的旁边的地铺上坐下来。他们热情地要我们讲中国人民如何在毛主席领导下打倒了蒋介石集团，打倒了地主和官僚资本家。他们兴奋地听我们讲，不断提出问题来，当他们听到中国农民经过斗争，打倒了地主，分到了土地，并且组织起来，成立人民公社的时候，个个非常高兴和兴奋。这个领导人说，“中国人民热爱毛主席，我们印第安人也热爱毛主席。中国兄弟是我们的榜样。我们也要象中国农民一样翻身求解放。”
      毛泽东思想震撼了资本主义世界
    中国人民还记得美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉几年前访问中国时那充满战斗激情的话语。是这位美国黑人领袖，把毛主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明视为珍宝，用大字印在他自己主编的刊物上，寄给美国和非洲的黑人兄弟们。是这位美国黑人领袖，把毛主席签过名的毛主席照片挂在自己的客厅里，并常常滔滔不绝地谈起他终生难忘的同毛主席的那次会见。在古巴我们曾不止一次地会见过他，他常常和我们谈起毛主席在声明中指出的民族问题就是阶级斗争问题的思想对他和对美国黑人斗争的启发。有一次，当他听到帝国主义和各国反动派攻击中国的时候，他立即进行了反驳，事后他气愤地对我们说：“是谁最坚决支持我们？我们黑人兄弟知道得最清楚：是毛泽东主席最坚决地支持我们全世界黑人兄弟的斗争！”
    从巴黎博览会中国馆的成功展出可以看到法国人民对新中国是多么热爱和对毛主席是何等敬仰！那时候参观中国展览馆的人，天天川流不息，人山人海。看了展览会以后，许多人都为中国的成就欢欣鼓舞。有的人把看了中国馆比拟为“看到了我们青春的希望”，有的人说：“中国人好极了，真是个榜样。”有的人在留言簿上写下这样的口号：“高举马克思列宁主义旗帜的中国万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”有一次中国的一个演出队到法国一个古老的城市演出，有一位老太太看了演出后，走上前来，希望演出队赠送她一枚毛主席纪念章。当她的心愿满足后，她端详着纪念章，看了又看，十分高兴，并紧紧拥抱了送她纪念章的那位中国演员。后来在第二次演出时，观众中又出现了那位老太太，这位老太太又一次说，她还有一个女儿，希望再得到一枚毛主席纪念章……。中国艺术团在访问意大利波伦亚的时候，每次走在大街上，常常跑来一些人，打听是不是从中国来的。他们在得到证实后就高兴地伸出大拇指说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”有一次，中国艺术团到文化名城佛罗伦萨参观，在一个著名的画廊里，一个白发苍苍的老太太正在临摹一幅名画。当知道这批客人是来自中国的时候，她用一种蕴藏着无限深情的目光打量着艺术团人员，连连称道：“中国，多么美好的地方啊！中国，毛泽东的故乡！”法国朋友玛丽·约瑟的话道出了革命人民的心声。这位法国朋友说：
  “我特别喜欢的是你们伟大的领袖毛泽东的著作，因为我很热爱和尊敬他。”“我很愿意学习毛泽东思想。因为他是一个伟大的人，一个真正忠实反帝的人。他的伟大思想震撼了资本主义世界，特别是美帝国主义。”
      毛泽东是世界革命的伟大舵手
    从世界的这一个大洲到另一个大洲，革命的人民虽有民族、语言和肤色的差异，但是他们对毛主席的热爱是共同的，学习毛主席著作的迫切愿望也是共同的。这里用不着述说高举马克思列宁主义革命旗帜的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛主席的深厚革命感情，用不着描写同我们同生死共患难的朝鲜和越南人民对我们伟大领袖的爱戴，这是大家所共知的。我们不能忘记缅甸的一位进步朋友，他对新中国的感情是那么深厚，对我们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席是那样地敬爱。他曾经说：“北京是世界革命的象征，毛泽东是世界革命的伟大舵手，毛泽东著作发出万道光芒，照亮了世界人民革命的道路。要革命的人就必须认真读毛主席的书！”我们也不能够忘记在日本东京的一批青年，他们从一九六四年一月起，就组织了“毛泽东思想研究会”，规定每周聚集一次，集体学习毛主席的著作，两年多以来一直坚持下来。不久前这些日本青年同我们谈到了他们学习毛泽东思想的一些体会。在东京一所大学学习中国文学的一位女学生说，毛泽东主席提出的中间地带的理论是完全正确的。美帝国主义是纸老虎这个思想的最根本的一点就是相信人民的力量。一位日本青年说，中国在毛泽东主席领导下所走过的和正在走的道路向全世界人民提供了一个范例。今天亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的国家要走资本主义道路是走不通的，而中国实行自力更生，建设社会主义的道路向人们提示了一个方向。一位在大学进行科学研究工作的青年说，毛主席不仅是一个伟大的政治家、军事家，同时也是一个伟大的科学家。毛泽东主席提出阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命任务是非常英明的。
    我们在同各国的革命的朋友们谈论到当前亚非拉反帝反殖民族解放运动蓬勃开展并取得了伟大胜利的时候，这些朋友们常常不约而同地把取得胜利的原因和接受毛泽东思想指导联系起来。瑞典作家扬·米尔达在一篇评论《毛泽东军事文选》的文章中指出，毛泽东是一个伟大的指挥员，他的伟大是无可争辩的，甚至连他的反对者也早就看到了这点。他的著作给亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命者提供了关于正在进行或者将要发动的革命战争的理论根据。
    正是由于这样，各国革命的人民都怀着强烈的革命感情学习毛泽东著作。有许多人不顾生命的危险，到处寻找毛主席的著作，秘密地进行阅读；更有许多人把毛主席的著作分篇分段油印或抄录出来转送给别人。许多革命志士在敌人的监狱里也没有停止过读毛主席的书。委内瑞拉的一个被捕的革命者给难友们找到了两本毛主席的著作，由于人多书少，他们就分成小组进行阅读和讨论，有的人在晚上不睡觉，凭借微弱的灯光进行阅读。我们曾见过许多朋友，他们珍藏的《毛泽东选集》，登载毛主席的文章的剪报，都已破旧了，他们不知读了多少遍。他们说：每读一遍就可以从中得到新的启示。有的朋友说：“毛主席的书是无穷尽的理论宝库，要掌握它，就要天天学。”
      毛泽东思想的传播是阻挡不了的
    大家知道，印度尼西亚的右派将领集团在篡夺了国家政权以后，对这个千岛之国进行了血腥的大屠杀和大逮捕，并且猖狂地进行反华反共反人民活动。但就在这样法西斯白色恐怖下，当我们在印度尼西亚的时候，仍然感到印度尼西亚人民对中国共产党和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的热爱。去年十月间，我们的记者从北京回雅加达，带了一个毛主席石膏象，在雅加达机场时一些印度尼西亚人见了，就兴奋地喊起毛泽东的名字来。有一次，我们的司机同志在汽车里读《毛泽东选集》，当一个印度尼西亚士兵看到封面上的毛主席象的时候，就竖起大拇指，连声说：“毛泽东，巴古士（好极了的意思）！”这些事情，发生在白色恐怖笼罩下的印度尼西亚，说明中国革命和毛泽东思想在印度尼西亚人民中间有着多么深远的影响，这种影响是印度尼西亚反动派所无法消除的。
    在这里，我们不能不提到苏联和一些东欧国家。在那里，背叛了马克思列宁主义的现代修正主义者们同帝国主义和各国反动派勾结在一起掀起了一股反华逆流，他们害怕真理，害怕毛泽东思想，因此他们千方百计地封锁毛泽东著作，妄图阻止毛泽东思想的传播。然而，真理是封锁不住的，毛泽东思想的传播也是阻挡不了的。现代修正主义者们越想封锁毛泽东著作，那里的人民越要学习毛泽东著作；现代修正主义者们越攻击我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，那里的人民越加热爱毛主席。在苏联和一些东欧国家采访的日子里，我们发现，那里的广大人民是愿意革命的，他们坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义，坚决反对修正主义，他们把希望寄托在中国共产党和毛主席身上，他们说：“北京是世界革命的灯塔，毛泽东是世界革命的舵手。”
      毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳
    千言万语述不尽世界各国人民对毛主席的爱戴和他们对毛主席著作的向往。我们所到之地，当人们知道我们是来自新中国时，他们就竖起大拇指欢呼“毛泽东！”他们看到一件来自中国的物品时也高呼“毛泽东！”当人们看中国电影，看到毛主席在银幕上出现时，就立刻爆发出长时间的春雷般的掌声，有的人高呼“毛泽东万岁！”战斗在富科特山前线的老挝爱国战士们把“毛泽东万岁！”作为前线鼓舞斗志的战斗口号之一。我们忘不了一九六五年十一月在索马里举办中国展览会时的动人情景，那时索马里人成群结队地到巨幅的毛主席象前摄影留念，人们争先地索要毛主席纪念章，得到的人骄傲地佩戴在胸前。许多观众满怀激情地在留言簿上写道：“向毛泽东致敬！”“毛泽东，谢谢你为我们指明前进的方向！”“毛泽东万岁！”我们曾遇见来自几内亚的一位歌唱家，他在舞台上热情洋溢地歌唱他自己编的《战斗的非洲歌颂毛泽东和他的伟大的事业》。他说，他虽然没有见过毛主席，但不能不歌颂毛主席。他说，毛主席的著作是无穷的力量；毛主席的思想是永远不落的太阳！他说，在非洲他要把这歌声献给黑人兄弟；如果在欧美，他就要对白人兄弟歌唱。他要“把这真理的声音传播，这真理，就是争取自由的战斗的号角；这真理就是普照宇宙的光辉的毛泽东思想！”
    说不完道不尽的激动人心的故事，说明在世界革命人民的心目中，毛主席不仅是领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的革命领袖。全中国人民拥护他、爱戴他，全世界人民也都拥护他、爱戴他。毛泽东思想是世界革命的灯塔，毛主席的思想光辉普照宇宙，毛主席的著作传遍世界。让帝国主义、各国反动派和国内外的现代修正主义者去狂吠吧，他们对我们的伟大领袖的诬蔑和攻击，丝毫无损于光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的光辉。　（新华社驻外记者集体采写）
