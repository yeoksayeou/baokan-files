    The people of the eastern Henan plain region, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are in high spirits and full of fighting will, and have achieved a bumper wheat harvest this year.
    During the busy wheat harvesting season, reporters visited the eastern Henan plain. What was seen along the way was a golden expanse of wheat, being harvested. In the wheat fields of various production teams, tall wheat stacks stood one after another. Good news of increased production spread everywhere. Yongcheng County, which is located in a low-lying area, saw a total wheat output increase by more than 30% compared to last year. Ningling County, which has a large area of sandy cultivated land, saw a per-mu yield increase of about 50% for wheat grown on sandy land this year compared to last year. In Yucheng County, the 240,000 mu of saline-alkali land sown with wheat this year generally saw a per-mu yield increase of about 30% compared to last year. This year's wheat harvest in the eastern Henan plain is so good that it is rare in history.
    When talking about this year's bumper wheat harvest, the people of eastern Henan unanimously praised Mao Zedong Thought with enthusiasm. They said: This year's bumper wheat harvest comes from reading Chairman Mao's books. Without reading Chairman Mao's books and without listening to Chairman Mao's words, we would not have such a good harvest this year. Some wrote song lyrics, singing the glorious light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, singing about how the disaster area has changed its appearance. Some bought new portraits of Chairman Mao and posted them in the center of their rooms, expressing that they will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and always follow Chairman Mao.

    豫东人民斗志昂扬小麦增产
    河南省东部平原地区人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，意气风发，斗志昂扬，夺得了今年小麦丰收。
    麦收大忙期间，记者来到豫东平原访问。沿途所见，麦子一片金黄，正在收割。在各个生产队的麦场上，高大的麦垛，一个接着一个。到处传播着增产的好消息。地势低洼的永城县，今年小麦总产量比去年增加三成以上。沙耕地面积较大的宁陵县，今年沙地小麦亩产量比去年增加五成左右。虞城县今年种的二十四万亩盐碱地小麦，亩产量一般比去年增产三成左右。豫东平原今年小麦收成这样好，在历史上是少见的。
    豫东人民在谈到今年的小麦丰收时，一致地热情歌颂毛泽东思想，他们说：今年小麦丰收，是读毛主席的书读来的。不读毛主席的书，不听毛主席的话，咱们就没有今年这样的好收成。有的编了歌词，歌唱伟大的毛泽东思想放光芒，歌唱灾区面貌变了样。有的买了新的毛主席象，贴在房中央，表示要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席走。
