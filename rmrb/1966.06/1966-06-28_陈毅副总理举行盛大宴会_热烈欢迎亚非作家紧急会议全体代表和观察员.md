Vice Premier Chen Yi hosted a grand banquet to warmly welcome all delegates and observers of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

Chen Yi, Vice Premier, said that the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union advocate peaceful coexistence with imperialism, which is paving the way for imperialist subversive activities. We Asian and African countries must not be fooled by imperialism, nor should we be deceived by Soviet modern revisionism.

Secretary-General Manuvila said that this conference is aimed at strengthening unity and consolidating the anti-imperialist united front. We must resolutely fight against imperialism and revisionism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated June 27, Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council held a grand banquet at the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome the delegates and observers attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Lin Feng and Liu Ningyi, and relevant officials attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke, representing the Chinese government and people in extending a warm welcome to the delegates from various countries. He said that your coming to Beijing for the conference is a support to the Chinese people, and we express our heartfelt thanks. He said that your choice to hold the conference in Beijing is very appropriate. The Chinese government and people fully support your glorious struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and fully support your struggle to safeguard national independence.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that so far, including the delegates currently on their way to Beijing, there are representatives from 50 countries (regions) participating in the conference, which accounts for the majority of Asian and African countries that have already gained independence and those that are still fighting. This proves that those who attempt to sabotage Asian and African unity and split our anti-imperialist and anti-colonial movement have suffered a miserable defeat.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, which began today, discussed the issue that concerns the vast majority of people in the world—the issue of world peace. The obstacles to world peace are imperialism and old and new colonialism. Only by overthrowing imperialism and old and new colonialism can we strive for world peace, especially by overthrowing the most vicious enemy of the world's people—the American imperialism. Therefore, establishing a unified front against American imperialism worldwide is the central issue of the conference. The discussion of this issue involves the most urgent and direct interests of billions of people. I believe that at this conference, you will use your wisdom and fully exercise democratic spirit to solve the problem of expanding the anti-American united front in a more practical and broader way. I wish the conference a great success!

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the fundamental situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America today is: imperialism has not completely withdrawn, and those that have withdrawn are trying to sneak back in. For the vast majority of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, the current task is to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolution to the end, to completely drive away imperialism, and to achieve complete independence in politics, economy, military, and culture. This struggle must be sustained and repeated, mainly against the subversive activities of imperialism. If we are careless, we will fall into the trap of imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi further pointed out that the modern revisionists of the Soviet Union advocate peaceful coexistence with imperialism, which is paving the way for imperialist subversive activities. We Asian and African countries must not be fooled by imperialism, nor should we be deceived by Soviet modern revisionism. When the broad Asian, African, and Latin American countries carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial national revolution to the end and build independent national economies and cultures, entering socialism will not be particularly difficult. This is the path that the Chinese people have taken over the past few decades. If the delegates from various countries are willing to study, it can be used as a reference.

Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yi raised his glass to toast the health of the delegates from various countries and the success of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He shouted: Down with American imperialism, victory to Vietnam!

Secretary-General Manuvila of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers spoke at the banquet. He said that the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau is a revolutionary fighting organization, and our task is to oppose American imperialism and its running dogs—the Soviet modern revisionists. Therefore, in such a situation, choosing to hold the conference in Beijing is the most appropriate. We hold the conference in Beijing because in Beijing, we can be inspired and enlightened, which is very necessary for our struggle against the enemy. He said that this conference is aimed at strengthening unity and consolidating the anti-imperialist united front. We must resolutely fight against imperialism and revisionism. Everything we have done and will do will make American imperialism and its running dogs—the Soviet modern revisionists—very frightened, and that is our victory.

In refuting the slander of American imperialism against China, he said that American imperialism is the greatest destroyer and worst aggressor of the 20th century. They say that China is "aggressive," which precisely proves that the Chinese people are right. China has not invaded any country, and China has not established military bases in any country, while American imperialism is invading Vietnam, the Dominican Republic, and many other countries. He said that every thinking person knows that China is at the forefront of the struggle against American imperialism and its henchmen. No one can deny that China is not only leading the revolutionary movement of the Asian and African peoples but also leading the revolutionary movement of the Latin American and world peoples. China is indeed a "threat" to American imperialism, but to the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and to the revolutionary peoples of the world, China is a strong pillar. He finally pointed out that the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers has had a very good start today. He believes that this conference will definitely achieve great victories and successful results.

Guests invited to the banquet included friends from various countries who are in Beijing.

Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, and relevant officials Liu Xiao, Zhang Ziyu, Chu Tusun, Yuan Ziqin, Kang Keqing, Li Shubin, Hu Qili, and Le Songsheng also attended the banquet.

The banquet was filled with a warm, united, friendly, and joyful atmosphere. During the banquet, the capital's art workers performed wonderful performances.

    陈毅副总理举行盛大宴会
    热烈欢迎亚非作家紧急会议全体代表和观察员
    陈毅副总理说，苏联现代修正主义者宣扬同帝国主义可以和平共处，就是替帝国主义的颠覆活动开辟道路。我们亚非国家不要上帝国主义的当，也不要上苏联现代修正主义的当。
    曼努维拉秘书长说，我们这次会议是为了加强团结，巩固反帝统一战线。我们一定要同帝国主义、修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
    据新华社二十七日讯　国务院副总理陈毅今晚在人民大会堂举行盛大宴会，热烈欢迎出席亚非作家紧急会议的全体代表和观察员。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林枫、刘宁一和有关方面负责人出席了宴会。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上讲话，他代表中国政府和中国人民热烈欢迎各国代表。他说，你们来北京开会，这是对中国人民的支持，我们表示衷心的感谢。他说，你们选择在北京开会，选择得很对。中国政府和人民全力支持你们反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的光荣斗争，全力支持你们争取和维护民族独立的光荣斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，到现在为止，连同正在来京途中的代表，已经有五十个国家（地区）的代表团参加会议，占亚非已经取得独立的国家和正在斗争中的国家的大多数，这证明那些企图破坏亚非团结和分裂我们亚非作家反帝反殖运动的人们遭到了惨败。
    陈毅副总理指出，今天开始的亚非作家紧急会议讨论了全世界绝大多数人民最关心的问题——世界和平的问题。世界和平的障碍是帝国主义和新老殖民主义，只有打倒帝国主义和新老殖民主义，才有可能争取世界和平，特别是要打倒世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义，因此建立一个全世界的反对美帝国主义的统一战线便是会议的中心议题。会议讨论这个问题，涉及几十亿人民最迫切、最切身的利害关系。我相信，在这次会议上运用你们的智慧，充分发挥民主精神，一定能够更加实际地、更加广泛地解决扩大反美统一战线的问题。我预祝大会成功！
    陈毅副总理指出，今天亚非拉的根本局势是：帝国主义没有完全退出去，而已退出去的还要钻进来。对于广大的亚非拉国家来说，现在是要把反帝反殖的革命进行到底，把帝国主义完全赶走，在政治上、经济上、军事上、文化上获得完全的独立。这个斗争必须持续地反复地进行，主要是反对帝国主义的颠覆活动，这一点稍有疏忽大意，就要上帝国主义的当。
    陈毅副总理又指出，苏联现代修正主义者宣扬同帝国主义可以和平共处，就是替帝国主义的颠覆活动开辟道路。我们亚非国家不要上帝国主义的当，也不要上苏联现代修正主义的当。当亚非拉广大国家把反帝反殖的民族革命进行到底，把独立的民族经济和文化建设起来，这样，进入社会主义便不是特别困难的事。这就是几十年来中国人民所走过的道路。如果各国代表愿意研究，可作参考。
    最后，陈毅副总理举杯祝各国代表身体健康，祝亚非作家紧急会议圆满成功。他高呼：美帝必败，越南必胜！
    亚非作家紧急会议秘书长曼努维拉在宴会上讲话。他说，亚非作家常设局是革命的战斗组织，而我们的任务是反对美帝国主义及其走狗——苏联现代修正主义，因此在这样的情况下，我们选择在北京举行会议是最适当的。我们所以要在北京召开会议，是因为在北京，我们可以得到鼓舞和启发，这对我们同敌人进行斗争是非常必需的。他说，我们这次会议是为了加强团结，巩固反帝统一战线。我们一定要同帝国主义、修正主义进行坚决的斗争。我们已经做的和将要做的一切，一定会使美帝国主义及其走狗——苏联现代修正主义感到非常恐惧，而这就是我们的胜利。
    他在驳斥美帝国主义者对中国的诬蔑时说，美帝国主义是二十世纪最大的破坏者，最坏的侵略者，他们说中国“好战”，正好证明中国人民做得对。中国没有侵略任何一个国家，中国没有在任何国家建立军事基地，而美帝国主义却在越南、在多米尼加和在其他许多国家进行侵略。他说，每个有思考能力的人，都知道中国是站在反对美帝国主义及其爪牙的斗争的最前列。谁也不能否认，中国不仅是在领导亚非各国人民的革命运动，而且是在领导拉丁美洲和世界人民的革命运动。中国的确对美帝国主义是个“威胁”，但是中国对亚、非、拉革命人民和全世界革命人民却是个坚强的支柱。他最后指出，亚非作家紧急会议今天已经有了很好的开端。他相信这次会议一定会取得巨大胜利和圆满结果。
    应邀出席宴会的还有在北京的各国朋友。
    中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志和有关方面负责人刘晓、张奚若、楚图南、袁子钦、康克清、栗树彬、胡启立、乐松生等也出席了宴会。
    宴会充满了热烈、团结、友好和欢乐的气氛。席间，首都文艺工作者表演了精采节目。
