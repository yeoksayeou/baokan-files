    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th—Zhejiang Province recently used industrial waste to make two new fertilizers: Kiln Ash Potassium Fertilizer and Precipitated Calcium Phosphate.
    Kiln Ash Potassium Fertilizer is made by the Hangzhou Cement Plant using kiln ash that is emitted during the calcination of cement clinker in rotary kilns, mixed with tuff. This potassium fertilizer contains 10% potassium and can be directly applied to crops such as potatoes and corn.
    Precipitated Calcium Phosphate is made by the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Chemical Industry using waste hydrochloric acid. This new phosphate fertilizer contains 25% to 27% effective phosphorus, which has a significant yield-increasing effect on crops such as rice and rapeseed. Moreover, it is non-toxic and can be mixed into feed to raise piglets, promoting bone development.

    浙江利用工业废料制成两种新化肥
    新华社杭州二十日电　浙江省最近利用工业废料制成两种新化肥——窑灰钾肥和沉淀磷酸钙。
    窑灰钾肥是杭州水泥厂利用在回转窑上煅烧水泥熟料时外扬的窑灰，掺入凝灰岩配制而成的。这种钾肥含钾质百分之十，可以直接施于马铃薯、玉米等农作物。
    沉淀磷酸钙是浙江省化学工业研究所利用废盐酸制成的。这种新磷肥含有效磷百分之二十五到二十七，对水稻、油菜等农作物有显著的增产效果，而且它没有毒，可以拌入饲料喂养小猪，促进骨骼发育。
