    Comrade Zhang Chunyu, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, tempered in labor, work, and class struggle, has grown into a staunch communist warrior. Excerpts from his diary (see page two) display the brilliant radiance of the proletariat's new thoughts, new culture, new style, and new habits.

    Comrade Zhang Chunyu creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. He prioritized revolution, work, and others. In the face of the danger of a tunnel collapse, he selflessly saved his comrades. With his body pinned down by a boulder, his leg bones crushed, he still worried about other comrades. As soon as his mind recovered, he took out Chairman Mao's works to study and helped everyone else study. In ordinary times, he took hardship first, volunteered for heavy burdens, and considered being able to dedicate himself to the people's railway construction as the greatest joy and happiness. He experienced a life-and-death test and then endured a struggle against disability, becoming even stronger. Comrade Zhang Chunyu, like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, has become a hard-boned warrior of the proletariat.

    Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle educated Comrade Zhang Chunyu to never forget class struggle. He was constantly vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois ideology. He dared to compete with the enemy in various forms of class struggle and tempered himself in the class struggle. He infinitely loved Chairman Mao and infinitely loved the Party. In his hospital bed, after hearing the "Three-Family Village" gang's attack on Mao Zedong Thought, he was filled with righteous indignation and immediately stood at the forefront of the class struggle, taking up his pen and fiercely firing on the "Three-Family Village" gang to defend Mao Zedong Thought.

    He used Mao Zedong Thought to transform his worldview. He understood that only a life of complete and thorough service to the people is a shining life. He always and in everything prioritized the interests of the people. What he thought of was not any personal plan, but how he could do more work for the people in his life. He repeatedly studied the article "Serve the People," determined to be a domestic revolutionary, an international revolutionary, and to dedicate his life to the liberation of the people of the world.

    Following Chairman Mao's teachings, Comrade Zhang Chunyu consciously engaged in labor training. He was a knowledgeable youth from a poor peasant family, but he still attached great importance to physical labor, regarding labor as an important way to revolutionize his thinking. He deeply realized that participating in physical labor can promote people's ideological revolutionization, strengthen the proletarian worldview, and establish deep feelings for the working people. Participating in physical labor can promote the revolutionary spirit of hard work and plain living, enduring great hardship and labor, self-reliance, and striving for progress. An important reason why Comrade Zhang Chunyu was able to quickly grow into a staunch revolutionary fighter is that he was able to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, and was willing to go to the most difficult environments to train himself.

    Warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. Comrade Zhang Chunyu, like the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings. He regarded Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions. He strived to do what Chairman Mao said. He compared Mao Zedong Thought to the red sun in his heart. With Mao Zedong Thought, he had direction, courage, and strength; and he had a very lofty aspiration: "In this life, I am willing to be a handful of soil, a piece of stone, a sleeper, laid on the road to communism, allowing the revolutionary train to pass over me and advance at full speed!"

    In the current tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all proletarian revolutionaries must draw inspiration from Comrade Zhang Chunyu's deeds of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, use Mao Zedong Thought as an invincible and powerful weapon, charge towards all bourgeois ideological and cultural positions, sweep away all monsters and demons, promote proletarian ideology on a grand scale, eliminate bourgeois ideology on a grand scale, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

### 一个共产主义战士的成长

    一个共产主义战士的成长
    张春玉同志，是在毛泽东思想哺育下，在劳动中，在工作中，在阶级斗争中，千锤百炼，成长起来的一个坚强的共产主义战士。他的日记摘抄（见第二版），显示出无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风格、新习惯的灿烂光辉。
    张春玉同志活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。他做到了革命第一，工作第一，他人第一。在隧道塌方的危险面前，他舍身救战友。巨石卡住了身子，压碎腿骨，他还念念不忘别的同志。他的精神刚刚恢复，就拿出毛主席著作来学习，并且帮助大家学习。在平时，他吃苦在先，争挑重担，把自己能够献身于人民的铁路建设，当成最大的愉快和幸福。他经历了一场生死的考验，又经受了一场同伤残的斗争，变得更加坚强了。张春玉同志，象雷锋、王杰、麦贤得一样，成为无产阶级的硬骨头战士。
    毛主席关于阶级斗争学说，教育张春玉同志永远不忘记阶级斗争。他时刻警惕着不受资产阶级思想的侵蚀。他敢于在各种形式的阶级斗争中，同敌人较量，并在阶级斗争中锻炼自己。他无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱党。他在病床上，听到“三家村”黑帮对毛泽东思想的攻击之后，义愤填膺，立即站到阶级斗争的最前列，拿起笔来，向“三家村”黑帮猛烈开火，捍卫毛泽东思想。
    他用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观。他懂得只有完全、彻底为人民服务的一生，才是闪闪发光的一生。他时时事事以人民利益为重。他想到的，不是任何个人打算，而是怎样在一生中能够为人民多做些工作。他反复多次学习《为人民服务》这篇文章，立志要当国内革命派、国际革命派，把自己的一生贡献给全世界人民的解放事业。
    遵照毛主席的教导，张春玉同志自觉地进行劳动锻炼。他是贫农家庭出身的知识青年，但他仍然十分重视体力劳动，把劳动当成思想革命化的重要途径。他深切地体会到，参加体力劳动，能够促进人的思想革命化，坚定无产阶级的世界观，建立对劳动人民的深厚感情。参加体力劳动，能够发扬艰苦朴素，吃大苦耐大劳，自力更生，奋发图强的革命精神。张春玉同志所以能迅速成长为一个坚强的革命战士，一个重要原因，就是他能够活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。并乐于到最艰苦的环境里去锻炼。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，是最大的战斗力。张春玉同志，象广大工农兵群众一样，怀着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。他把毛主席的书当作最高指示。努力做到毛主席怎样说，我就怎样做。他把毛泽东思想比成心中的红太阳。有了毛泽东思想，就有了方向，有了勇气，有了力量；而且有了一个十分崇高的志愿：“我这一辈子，愿作一把泥土、一块石子、一根枕木，铺在通往共产主义的大道上，让革命的列车从我身上通过，全速前进！”
    在当前社会主义文化大革命的浪潮中，一切无产阶级的革命派，都要从张春玉同志活学活用毛主席著作的事迹中得到启示，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，运用毛泽东思想这个无坚不摧的强大武器，向一切资产阶级的思想阵地和文化阵地冲锋，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
