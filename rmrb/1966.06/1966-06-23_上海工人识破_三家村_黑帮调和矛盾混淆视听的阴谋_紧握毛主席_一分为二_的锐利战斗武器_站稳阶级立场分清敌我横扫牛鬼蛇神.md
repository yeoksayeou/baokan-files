    Shanghai Workers See Through the "Three-Family Village" Black Gang's Conspiracy to Reconcile Contradictions and Confuse the Public
    Firmly Grasp Chairman Mao's Sharp Fighting Weapon of "One Divides into Two"
    Stand Firm on the Class Standpoint, Distinguish Between the Enemy and Ourselves, and Sweep Away All Demons and Monsters
    The class enemy is most afraid of "One Divides into Two" and also hates "One Divides into Two." We must love it even more, defend it, and pass on the fighting weapon of "One Divides into Two" from generation to generation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd – Shanghai workers are determined to forever firmly grasp "One Divides into Two," this sharp fighting weapon, to "kill with one blow" all demons and monsters.
    The reporter recently visited some factories and enterprises in Shanghai and participated in their denunciation meetings against the anti-Party, anti-socialist black gang. I gained a clear impression: The working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and possessing rich practical experience in class struggle, has the deepest feelings, the most thorough understanding, and the most flexible application of Chairman Mao's great thought of "One Divides into Two." Shanghai workers say that the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party, anti-socialist black gang's shout about applying "One Divides into Two" to them and not "killing them with one blow" is an open attack on the Party with extremely sinister intentions. They vainly attempt to use this to deceive the masses, hide themselves, and bide their time to stage a comeback. This is absolutely impossible. The broad masses of workers express: Chairman Mao's great theory of "One Divides into Two" is the philosophy of revolution. We revolutionary people will forever firmly grasp "One Divides into Two," this sharp fighting weapon, and "kill you with one blow"!
    Shanghai workers say: "One Divides into Two" is the core of dialectical materialism. Open "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and on the first page, the first line, Chairman Mao teaches us to stand firm on the proletarian standpoint and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. We must use "One Divides into Two," this demon-revealing mirror, to separate the demons and monsters from the revolutionary ranks and thoroughly overthrow them all. Shanghai workers believe that Deng Tuo and his ilk shout about "One Divides into Two" to vainly attempt to use the name of "One Divides into Two" to carry out class reconciliation and confuse people's vision. Their tactic of waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag is more insidious and vicious than Yang Xianzhen's open advocacy of "Two Combine into One" to oppose "One Divides into Two." This is a blatant attack on Mao Zedong Thought and a great conspiracy. Chen Xinyu, the Party branch secretary of the famous Daqing-style enterprise, Dexin Metal Smelting Plant, who was born as a worker, and Zang Fengyi, a car electrician from the Shanghai Vehicle Section of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, analyze: The revolutionary people of China and the world most revere Chairman Mao and most love to listen to Chairman Mao's words. Deng Tuo and his gang vainly attempt to take advantage of this sentiment, steal Chairman Mao's great theory of "One Divides into Two," and set up a bewitching formation, attempting to muddy the waters in the current life-and-death class struggle, blur the class boundaries of the revolutionary people, so that they can restore capitalism. This will never work!
    Shanghai workers angrily denounce Deng Tuo and his ilk: Mao Zedong Thought has armed us, and we see through your conspiracies and tricks at a glance. Without "Two Combine into One," you cannot survive. We must adhere to "One Divides into Two" and thoroughly eliminate your "Two Combine into One." You want us to engage in class reconciliation with you. This is wishful thinking! Revolutionary people and class enemies can never "combine"! Chairman Mao teaches us that we must look at the essence of things. Whether it is a tiger in the east mountain or a tiger in the west mountain, whether it is a smiling tiger or a tiger with a gaping bloody mouth, it is still a tiger. Tigers want to eat people, that is their essence. The essence of the exploiting classes is to exploit the working people, to eat up and squeeze out every sinew and drop of blood of the working people. The "Three-Family Village" gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, whether in front or behind the scenes, on the stage or off the stage, their essence is to seize our power and exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat, to restore capitalism in China.
    The concrete analysis of concrete problems is the essence of Marxist philosophy. Chairman Mao said: "Without concrete analysis, it is impossible to recognize the characteristics of any contradiction." Chairman Mao also said: "The special essence of each form of motion of matter is determined by its own special contradiction." In the current struggle, Shanghai workers have further studied Chairman Mao's philosophical thought and feel particularly close to this viewpoint. They point out: "One Divides into Two" is a universal truth, and everything can be "divided into two," but the specific way of dividing is different. Tao Youzhi, a cadre who was born as a worker, said: The method of dividing advantages and disadvantages, merits and demerits, etc., can only be used within our people and must never be used to analyze the enemy. On the issue of the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, we must use the method of dividing between counter-revolution and revolution. Deng Tuo and his ilk want us not to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and to divide your advantages and disadvantages as well. This is a vain attempt to steal the beams and pillars, to use metaphysical concepts to篡改 revolutionary dialectics.
    Shanghai workers also believe that the analysis of "One Divides into Two" for the enemy should see their two aspects: they are both real tigers that want to eat people, and paper tigers that can be punctured with one poke. They are both bad things, but after thoroughly exposing their reactionary essence, they can play the role of negative teachers, turning bad things into good things. Many workers analyze that this group of bourgeois representatives seized the leadership of some of our departments, formed black gangs, drew black lines, and stirred up black winds, with command, organization, planning, and purpose, to vainly attempt to restore capitalism in China. They have the echo of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, the support of domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and a group of bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" cheering and supporting them. In society, there is still a market for them to promote bourgeois ideology. From this point of view, they are real tigers. They are eating us bit by bit and want to eventually swallow our proletarian dictatorship. Some of our units have been swallowed by them. We cannot take such a thrilling class struggle lightly and must take it seriously. However, although they are deeply hidden, climb very high, and act very cleverly, as soon as the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued a battle call, hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers came together, using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all demons and monsters, and immediately pulled them down from the throne of "authority," beating them to the ground. This proves that they are nothing more than a pile of ugly things that cannot see the sun, a group of buzzing flies, and their true colors are exposed with one poke, indicating that they are paper tigers. Chen Fu, the chief material worker of the second converter workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, a Wang Tie-ren-style worker in Shanghai, said: "All reactionaries always act according to the logic of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until their demise. If we just bury ourselves in production, forget class struggle, relax our vigilance, and fall for their tricks, they are real tigers and will eat us, turning our entire country into a different color. But we use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, brighten our eyes, and resolutely fight against the reactionaries, they are paper tigers and vulnerable. We must more consciously use the weapon of 'One Divides into Two,' firmly grasp this revolutionary cudgel, and smash those man-eating tigers to pieces!"
    Jia Wenzhong, a technician from the China Textile Machinery Plant, further analyzed using Chairman Mao's "two-part method": "The demons and monsters have released so much poison, and some people have been poisoned. This is a bad thing. However, after criticism and struggle, the weeds that have been removed can fertilize the fields, and those negative teaching materials can make the people increase their vigilance, enhance their ability to identify, and increase their knowledge of class struggle. This is a good thing." Shanghai workers pointed out: Class struggle is an objective existence and does not change with people's will. A small number of bourgeois representatives have infiltrated the Party and government and the cultural field. This is a bad thing. However, in this great proletarian cultural revolution, these black gangs have been dug out, and the "time bombs" buried in our country have been removed. This is a great good thing and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. Things are developing forward in struggle. In the process of struggling with this group of black gangs, our Party will surely be further strengthened and developed, our proletarian dictatorship will be more consolidated, bourgeois ideology will be eliminated, and we will increasingly and richly accumulate experience in preventing the restoration of capitalism, making contributions to the world revolutionary cause. This is an even greater good thing. Shanghai workers pointed out with the heroic spirit of the firm proletarian revolutionaries: Without contradiction, there would be no world, no life. Our task is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, guide the situation, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end.
    Deng Tuo and his gang shouted that they are not "completely useless." Zhu Shiyou, the propaganda cadre of the political department of the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard, refuted: Good and bad are class-based and specific. What the landlords and bourgeoisie think is a good thing, but in the eyes of our revolutionary people, it is a bad thing. Conversely, what they say is bad, we must praise it as good. Deng Tuo and his gang, in the name of spreading "learning" and "knowledge," tried to make cadres and young people degenerate and achieve a comprehensive and thorough restoration of capitalism. Are there still some "learning," "knowledge," "art," and "skills" in their reactionary "works" that can be learned from? Shanghai workers analyzed that the "learning" and "knowledge" spread by this group of bourgeois masters are all reactionary, decadent, declining, and moldy, and cannot be seen in the socialist sun at all. The kind of "art" and "skills" that serve reactionary political content are obscure, artificial, and even obscene and disgusting. All of this is poisonous opium, letting us be "eaten" by them unknowingly. Zhao Shuchang from the Shanghai Automobile and Electric Machine Factory said: "To ask us to praise these things is like being beheaded by the enemy and praising the enemy's swordsmanship!"
    Deng Tuo and his gang also arrogantly touted that they had made "contributions" to the revolutionary cause. Shanghai workers replied: There is no question of merit or demerit for the enemy at all! Some of the "Three-Family Village" black gang were originally traitors, some were old rightists, and some passed the democratic revolution but rolled into the anti-Party, anti-socialist quagmire today. The "quality" of things has fundamentally changed, and they are counter-revolutionary. The workers also pointed out that without the accumulation of quantitative change, today's qualitative change will never occur. Today's qualitative change is precisely exposing that you were originally the ambitious, conspirators, and hypocrites of the exploiting classes!
    "We will kill all demons and monsters with one blow!" This is a powerful counterattack by the Shanghai working class! Tao Youzhi said: "Bourgeois masters, 'kill with one blow,' we still learned from you. In the old society, when you were in power, you knocked us working people to the ground with one blow. Even now, you still never forget to take back your lost paradise, vainly attempting to pour dog blood on our heads and beat us to death with Western clubs. We hold the seal of power and the handle of the knife. We must use their own methods to treat them, knock you down with one blow, and exercise dictatorship over you!" Shanghai workers believe that mercy to the enemy is betrayal of the revolution and cruelty to the people! For the interests of the Chinese revolutionary people and the interests of the revolutionary people of the world, we must thoroughly expose, thoroughly criticize, and thoroughly overthrow all demons and monsters. The class enemy is most afraid of "One Divides into Two" and also hates "One Divides into Two." We must love it even more, defend it, and pass on the fighting weapon of "One Divides into Two" from generation to generation!

    上海工人识破“三家村”黑帮调和矛盾混淆视听的阴谋
    紧握毛主席“一分为二”的锐利战斗武器
    站稳阶级立场分清敌我横扫牛鬼蛇神
    阶级敌人最怕“一分为二”，也最恨“一分为二”，我们就要更热爱它，保卫它，把“一分为二”的战斗武器，世世代代传下去
    新华社上海二十二日电　上海工人决心永远紧握“一分为二”这个锐利的战斗武器，把一切牛鬼蛇神“一棍子打死”。
    记者最近在上海的一些工厂企业，访问了一些职工，参加了他们对反党反社会主义黑帮的声讨会，得到一个鲜明的印象：用毛泽东思想武装起来的、有着丰富阶级斗争实践经验的工人阶级对毛主席“一分为二”的伟大思想，感情最深，理解最透，运用最活。上海工人们说，“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮，叫喊什么对他们要“一分为二”，不要把他们“一棍子打死”，这是明目张胆向党进攻，用心十分险恶。他们妄图以此迷惑群众，隐藏下来，伺机卷土重来。这是绝对办不到的。广大工人群众表示：毛主席“一分为二”的伟大学说，是革命的哲学。我们革命人民就是要永远紧握“一分为二”这个锐利的战斗武器，把你们“一棍子打死”！
    上海工人说：“一分为二”是辩证唯物论的核心。翻开《毛泽东选集》，第一页第一行，毛主席就是教导我们站稳无产阶级立场，分清敌我。我们就是要用“一分为二”这一照妖镜，把牛鬼蛇神从革命队伍里分出去，把它们统统斗垮。上海工人认为，邓拓之流叫嚷“一分为二”，就是妄图冒“一分为二”之名，行阶级调和之实，混淆人们的视听。他们用的这种打着“红旗”反红旗的手法，比杨献珍公开标榜“合二而一”对抗“一分为二”，更阴险，更狠毒。这是对毛泽东思想的猖狂进攻，是一个大阴谋。著名的大庆式企业德新金属冶炼厂工人出身的党支部书记陈鑫煜，上海铁路局上海车辆段车电工臧逢义分析：我们全中国、全世界革命人民，对毛主席最崇敬，对毛主席的话最爱听。邓拓这伙黑帮，就妄想利用人们这种心情，盗用毛主席“一分为二”的伟大学说，摆开迷魂阵，企图在当前你死我活的阶级搏斗中，把水搅浑，模糊革命人民的阶级界限，以便他们复辟资本主义。这万万办不到！
    上海工人愤慨地斥责邓拓之流：毛泽东思想武装了我们，我们一眼就看穿了你们的阴谋诡计。没有“合二而一”，你们就活不下去；我们就是要坚持“一分为二”，彻底破除你们的“合二而一”。你们要我们同你们搞阶级调和，这是妄想！革命人民和阶级敌人永远也“合”不起来！毛主席教导我们，看事情必须要看它的本质。不管是东山老虎还是西山老虎，是笑面虎还是张开血盆大口的虎，都是老虎，老虎要吃人，这就是它的本质。剥削阶级的本质，就是要剥削劳动人民，把劳动人民一根筋肉、一滴血都要吃光榨尽。“三家村”这伙反党反社会主义黑帮，无论是幕前的，幕后的，台上的，台下的，他们的本质，就是要夺取我们的政权，专我们无产阶级的政，要在中国复辟资本主义。
    具体问题的具体分析，是马克思主义哲学的精髓。毛主席说：“离开具体的分析，就不能认识任何矛盾的特性。”毛主席还说：“每一物质的运动形式所具有的特殊的本质，为它自己的特殊的矛盾所规定。”上海工人在当前这场斗争中，进一步学习了毛主席的哲学思想，对这一论点感到格外亲切。他们指出：“一分为二”是普遍真理，任何事物都可以“一分为二”，但是具体怎样分法，却各不相同。工人出身的干部陶友之说：优点和缺点，功和过等等分法，只能用在我们人民内部，绝不能用来分析敌人在敌我矛盾上，就是要用反革命和革命的分法。邓拓之流要我们不分敌我，对你们也去分优点和缺点，这是妄图偷梁换柱，用形而上学的概念，篡改革命的辩证法。
    上海工人还认为，对敌人“一分为二”的分析，应该是看到它们的两重性，既是真老虎，要吃人的；又是纸老虎，一戳就穿。既是坏的东西，但是在彻底揭露他们的反动本质以后，又可以起反面教员的作用，由坏事转化为好事。许多工人分析，这批资产阶级代表人物，夺取了我们一些部门的领导权，结黑帮，拉黑线，刮黑风，有指挥、有组织、有计划、有目的地妄想在中国复辟资本主义。他们有帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派的呼应，有国内地富反坏右支持，又有一批资产阶级的“专家”“权威”喝采、捧场。社会上，还存在他们宣扬资产阶级思想的市场。从这方面看，他们是真老虎。他们在一口一口地吃我们，而且想最后吞掉我们的无产阶级专政。我们有一些单位就曾经被他们吞了去。对这样惊心动魄的阶级斗争，我们不能等闲视之，必须认真对待。可是，尽管他们隐蔽得很深，爬得很高，活动得很巧妙，党中央和毛主席一发出战斗号召，亿万工农兵群众一起来，用毛泽东思想锐利武器，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，一下子就把他们从“权威”的宝座上拉下来，打得落花流水，证明他们不过是一堆见不得太阳的丑类，一群嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，一下就戳穿了他们的真面目，说明他们是纸老虎。上钢三厂第二转炉车间运料总工长，上海王铁人式的工人陈富说：“一切反动派总是要沿着捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败，直至灭亡的逻辑行事的。如果我们只是埋头生产，忘记了阶级斗争，放松了警惕，上了他们的当，他们就是真老虎，会把我们吃掉，让我们整个国家变颜色；而我们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，擦亮眼睛，坚决与反动派斗，他们就是纸老虎，不堪一击。我们就要更自觉地运用‘一分为二’这个武器，紧握这个革命的千钧棒，把那些吃人的老虎砸得粉碎！”
    中国纺织机械厂技术员贾文忠用毛主席“两分法”的观点进一步分析说：“牛鬼蛇神放了那么多的毒，有人中了毒，这是一件坏事。可是，经过批判、斗争，锄掉的毒草可以肥田，那些反面教材，可以使人民提高警惕，增强识别能力，增长阶级斗争知识，这又是一件好事。”上海工人指出：阶级斗争是客观存在，是不以人们的意志为转移的。一小撮资产阶级代表人物混进党和政府里，文化领域里，这是一件坏事；但在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，把这些黑帮揪了出来，把埋在我们国家里的“定时炸弹”挖掉了，这是一件大好事，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。事物是在斗争中向前发展的。在与这批黑帮作斗争的过程中，我们的党必将进一步壮大、发展，我们无产阶级专政必将更加巩固，资产阶级意识形态必将被消灭，我们必将越来越丰富地积累起防止资本主义复辟的经验，为世界革命事业作出贡献，这更是大大的好事。上海工人以坚定的无产阶级革命派的豪迈气概指出：没有矛盾，就没有世界，就没有生命。我们的任务，就是更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，因势利导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    邓拓这伙黑帮叫嚷，他们并非“一无是处”。上海求新造船厂政治部宣传干事朱世友驳斥说：好和坏是有阶级性的、具体的。地主资产阶级认为是好事，在我们革命人民看来却是坏事；反过来，他们说是坏的，我们偏偏要赞扬它好。邓拓这伙黑帮，以传“学问”“知识”为名，力图使干部、青年蜕化变质，全面地、彻头彻尾地实现资本主义复辟。他们那些反动透顶的“作品”里，是否还有一些“学问”、“知识”、“艺术”和“技巧”可以借鉴呢？上海工人分析说：这帮资产阶级老爷们散布的“学问”“知识”，全是反动的、腐朽的、没落的、发霉的，根本见不得社会主义的阳光。那种为反动政治内容服务的“艺术”、“技巧”，是隐晦的、造作的，甚至淫秽得令人作呕。这一切，都是毒人的鸦片，让我们在不知不觉中被他们“吃”掉。上海汽车电机厂赵书常说：“要我们对这些东西叫好，就等于被敌人杀了头，还称赞敌人的刀法好！”
    邓拓这伙黑帮还狂妄地标榜他们对革命事业有过“功”。上海工人回答：对敌人根本不存在功和过的问题！“三家村”黑帮有的原来就是叛徒，有的是老右派，有的过了民主革命的关，今天滚到了反党反社会主义的泥坑里，事物的“质”就根本变了，就是反革命。工人们还指出：没有量变的积累，决不会发生今天的质变。今天的质变，正暴露了你们本来就是剥削阶级的野心家，阴谋家，伪君子！
    “我们就是要把一切牛鬼蛇神一棍子打死！”这是上海工人阶级强有力的回击！陶友之说：“资产阶级的老爷们，‘一棍子打死’，我们还是从你们那儿学来的。在旧社会，你们掌着权，就是一棍子把我们劳动人民打倒在地下。直到现在，你们还念念不忘要夺回你们失去的天堂，妄想用狗血淋我们的头，用西洋棍子把我们打死。我们掌握着印把子、刀把子，就是要以其人之道还治其人之身，一棍子打倒你们，专你们的政！上海工人认为：对敌人的仁慈，就是对革命的叛变，就是对人民的残忍！为了中国革命人民的利益，为了全世界革命人民的利益，我们就是要对一切牛鬼蛇神彻底揭露，彻底批判，彻底打倒。阶级敌人最怕“一分为二”，也最恨“一分为二”，我们就要更热爱它，保卫它，把“一分为二”的战斗武器，世世代代传下去！
