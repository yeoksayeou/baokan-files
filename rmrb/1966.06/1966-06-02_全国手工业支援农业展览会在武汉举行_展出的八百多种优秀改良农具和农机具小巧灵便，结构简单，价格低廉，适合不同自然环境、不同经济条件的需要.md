    National Handicraft Industry Support Agriculture Exhibition Held in Wuhan
    More than 800 kinds of excellent improved agricultural tools and machinery exhibited are small and flexible, simple in structure, and inexpensive, suitable for different natural environments and different economic conditions.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st) The National Handicraft Industry Support Agriculture Exhibition recently opened in Wuhan. A large number of improved agricultural tools, as well as small and medium-sized semi-mechanized and mechanized agricultural machinery, were exhibited. These tools have the advantages of being small and flexible, simple in structure, and inexpensive.
    The exhibition showcased more than 800 kinds of excellent improved agricultural tools and semi-mechanized and mechanized agricultural machinery in eight aspects, including cultivation, irrigation, and agricultural and sideline product processing. There are bamboo and wood products, as well as steel and plastic products. Some are powered by human, animal, wind, and water, while others are driven by electricity and internal combustion engines, suitable for different natural environments and different economic conditions.
    The exhibition was jointly sponsored by the Second Ministry of Light Industry and the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives.
    Handicraft industries must adhere to the principle of "small, simple, and inexpensive" in providing agricultural tools. This is an important experience summarized by the vast number of handicraft workers after following Chairman Mao's teachings, implementing close integration with the peasant masses, conducting in-depth investigations and research, and gaining a new understanding of the revolutionary situation in agricultural production. Practice in various places has proved that agricultural tools with small designs, simple structures, durability, and low prices are easy to popularize and are suitable for the actual needs of production teams to run agriculture independently, and are the most popular "conventional weapons" among the vast number of peasants today. The hand-operated corn thresher produced by the Zigong Tool Factory in Sichuan Province costs only eight yuan per unit and weighs only 8.58 kilograms. It is small in size, simple in structure, and easy to operate. When installed on a stool, a semi-laborer can thresh 40 to 50 kilograms of corn per hour. The small animal-powered harvester produced by the Nanfan Cooperative Factory in Jiang County, Shanxi Province, does not require power machinery and can harvest 3 to 3.5 mu of dryland crops per hour, which not only improves production efficiency but also reduces the labor intensity of farmers. The price is also much lower than large-scale harvesting machinery. In addition, foot-operated green fodder beaters made by the Fengqiao Agricultural Machinery Cooperative in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, and foot-operated water pumps created by the Tieqi (Ironware) Cooperative in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, have also been well received by farmers.
    Multi-purpose machines, improving efficiency, and reducing the burden on farmers are another feature of the "small, simple, and inexpensive" products exhibited at this exhibition. According to the actual conditions of the local rural areas, the Gaomi County Agricultural Tool Cooperative Factory in Shandong Province manufactured a six-use cultivator hoe. Using the same bracket, plus related accessories that can be arbitrarily changed, it can be used for six aspects of dryland cultivation of various ridge crops and flat crops: cultivation, loosening soil, weeding, earthing up, sowing, and fertilizing, which greatly saves the rural communes and teams from purchasing a variety of production tools. The Taiyuan Iron Industry Cooperative Factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, successfully trial-produced the Taiyuan automatic thresher by combining factories, production teams, and scientific research departments. Although each unit costs 620 yuan, it is very adaptable and can be used for threshing and processing twelve crops in various regions and harvest seasons. The main food crops in various parts of our country, such as wheat, rice, sorghum, corn, and various beans, can all be threshed. This machine has undergone a two-year regional test in nineteen counties, proving that it has good performance and is easy to operate, and has won unanimous praise from farmers.
    Many exhibits at this exhibition show that vigorously producing "small, simple, and inexpensive" agricultural machinery can also make extensive use of China's rich resources, adapt to local conditions, and obtain materials locally, so that farmers can obtain truly high-quality and inexpensive improved agricultural tools. The Rongshui Town Woodware Cooperative in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region produces a bamboo tube enclosed waterwheel by using local materials, which saves labor and materials. One person can operate it and lift 18 tons of water per hour. Each unit only costs 11 yuan, which is much lower in price than wooden and plastic waterwheels. The back-mounted double-cylinder bamboo ammonia fertilizer applicator produced by the Nanyu Bamboo Production Cooperative in Minhou County, Fujian Province, using Phyllostachys pubescens bamboo instead of iron sheet, can not only save iron sheet or plastic and reduce costs, but also is acid and alkali resistant, making it more durable than iron fertilizer applicators. The Badou Sickle Factory in Zibo City, Shandong Province, used the traditional steel-cladding technology of China's ironware industry to produce native composite steel using waste materials, with inheritance and development. This native composite steel can manufacture curved or straight sickles according to the different usage habits of farmers in various places, saving the country from specifications of steel.
    Handicraft workers in various places regard the production of "small, simple, and inexpensive" agricultural machinery as a struggle in which politics commands production and technology. In the past, some workers looked down on "small, simple, and inexpensive" products, believing that this was not advanced technology. After they seriously studied Chairman Mao's writings and related instructions, they realized that they could not measure whether a product is advanced with a purely technical point of view, but should first see whether it meets the actual needs of the vast number of farmers.

    全国手工业支援农业展览会在武汉举行
    展出的八百多种优秀改良农具和农机具小巧灵便，结构简单，价格低廉，适合不同自然环境、不同经济条件的需要
    据新华社武汉一日电　全国手工业支援农业展览会最近在武汉展出。展览会上展出了大批改良农具，以及中小型的半机械化、机械化农机具。这些农具都有着小巧灵便，结构简单，价格低廉的优点。
    展览会共展出了八百多种包括耕作、排灌、农副产品加工等八个方面的优秀改良农具和半机械化、机械化农机具，既有竹木制品，也有钢铁、塑料制品，既有用人、畜、风、水为动力的，也有用电力、内燃机械带动的，适合不同自然环境、不同经济条件的需要。
    展览会是由第二轻工业部和全国手工业总社共同举办的。
    手工业为农业提供农具必须坚持“小、简、廉”的原则，这是广大手工业职工遵循毛主席的教导，实行同农民群众密切结合，深入调查研究，对农业生产的革命形势取得了新的认识以后总结出来的一条重要经验。各地的实践证明，式样小巧，结构简单，坚实耐用，价格低廉的农具，容易普及推广，适合生产队自力更生办农业的实际需要，是当前最受广大农民欢迎的“常规武器”。四川省自贡市工具厂生产的手摇玉米脱粒机，每台只值八元钱，全重只有八点五八公斤，体型小，结构简单，操作轻便，把它安在一条板凳上，一个半劳动力每小时就能脱四十到五十公斤玉米。山西省绛县南樊合作工厂生产的小型畜力收割机，不需要动力机械，每小时能收割旱地作物三到三点五亩，不仅提高了生产效率，而且减轻了农民的劳动强度，价格也比大型收割机械低得多。此外，诸如浙江嘉兴县风桥农机社制造的脚踏式青饲料打浆机，福建福州市铁器社创制的脚踏抽水机等等，也都受到了农民的好评。
    一机多用，提高使用效率，减轻农民负担，是这个展览会上展出的“小、简、廉”产品的另一个特点。山东省高密县农具合作工厂根据当地农村实际情况制造的六用耘锄，用同一个支架，加上可以任意变换的有关配件，就可以用于旱地各种垄作和平作物的中耕、松土、除草、培土、播种、施肥六方面，大大节省了农村社、队添置多种生产工具的开支。山西省太谷县铁业合作工厂采取工厂、生产队、科学研究部门三结合办法试制成功的太谷自动脱粒机，虽然每台需要六百二十元，但是适应性非常广泛，能用于各个地区各个收获季节的十二种作物的脱粒加工，我国各地的主要粮食作物如麦子、稻谷、高粱、玉米和各种豆类的脱粒都能采用。这台机器通过十九个县历时两年的区域性试验，证明性能良好，操作方便，博得农民一致好评。
    这个展览会的许多展品表明，大力生产“小、简、廉”的农机具，还能广泛利用我国各地的丰富资源，做到因地制宜，就地取材，使农民得到真正物美价廉的改良农具。广西壮族自治区大苗山苗族自治县融水镇木器社，就地取材生产了一种竹筒封闭式水车，省力省料，一人操作，每小时能提水十八吨，每部只需要十一元，价格比木制水车、塑料水车低许多成。福建省闽侯县南屿竹器生产合作社以楠竹代铁皮生产的背式双筒竹制氨水施肥器，不仅能节约铁皮或塑料，降低成本，而且耐酸耐碱，比铁制施肥器耐用。山东省淄博市八陡镰刀厂运用我国铁器行业传统的夹钢工艺，利用废料生产土复合钢，有继承有发展。这种土复合钢能够根据各地农民不同的使用习惯制造出弯形或直形镰刀，为国家节约了规格钢材。
    各地手工业职工都把生产“小、简、廉”的农机具，看作是一场政治统帅生产、技术的斗争。过去，有的职工看不起“小、简、廉”产品，认为这不是先进技术。当他们认真学习了毛主席著作和有关指示以后，才认识到不能用单纯的技术观点衡量一个产品是否先进，首先应该看它符合不符合广大农民的实际需要。（附图片）
