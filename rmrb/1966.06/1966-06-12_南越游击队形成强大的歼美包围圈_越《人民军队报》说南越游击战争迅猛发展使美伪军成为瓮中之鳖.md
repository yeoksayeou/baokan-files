　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 9th: The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army Daily" published a commentary on the 8th, pointing out that due to the vigorous development of guerrilla warfare and the rapid formation of the anti-American encirclement, the strongholds of the U.S.-puppet troops have become isolated islands in the ocean of the people's war in South Vietnam, trapped in a dilemma of advance and retreat, and in a passive and vulnerable situation, facing the danger of complete annihilation at any time.
    The commentary said that during the 1965-1966 dry season, one of the most troublesome and passive problems for the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs was the encirclement and attack by guerrillas on a series of strongholds and outposts from Guangzhi and Chengtian to Jin'ou, including mountainous and plain areas. In the southern West Zone alone, guerrillas encircled ten military sub-districts and twenty-nine strongholds and outposts of the enemy in the first three months of this year, forcing the enemy to withdraw from one military sub-district and twelve strongholds and outposts, annihilating and disintegrating more than 1,400 enemy personnel.
    The commentary said that due to the development of guerrilla warfare and the formation of the anti-American encirclement, guerrillas in many places are able to continuously encircle enemy strongholds and outposts for months, cutting off all enemy supply lines, turning them into turtles in a jar and birds in a cage. With the support of the people and the coordination of local troops, the guerrillas not only defeated the enemy breaking out of the encirclement, but also repelled the enemy's reinforcements. They are not only able to continue tightening the encirclement, but also annihilate a large number of the enemy's active forces.
    The commentary mentioned that the people have made significant contributions in the battles of encircling and attacking enemy strongholds. They not only worked with the guerrillas day and night to build combat fortifications, allowing the guerrillas to use their own fields as positions to encircle the enemy, but also flocked to county towns or provincial capitals in groups to launch fierce struggles against the puppet regime. They also worked with the guerrillas to mobilize puppet soldiers to leave the enemy ranks and return home to produce or join the revolution.
    The commentary said that under these circumstances, more and more of the encircled puppet soldiers are deserting. In the Minghe puppet military training camp in Tulongmu Province alone, two hundred and eighty soldiers deserted during the three months it was under siege.
    The commentary pointed out that this is a new development in guerrilla warfare. The South Vietnamese guerrillas have developed from defending villages and wearing down and eliminating the enemy in the past to continuously attacking and encircling enemy strongholds and outposts, and打击the main tools of the enemy's rule over the people - local "security forces" and "civil guards."
    The commentary said that this method of annihilating the enemy on the spot by the guerrillas is very powerful. It highly leverages the role of the people in the war, and can contain a large number of enemy troops with only a small force, and can also transfer enemies from other places to be worn down and eliminated, creating conditions for the People's Liberation Army to concentrate its forces to severely打击the enemy in other places and achieve brilliant victories. At the same time, this is also a method of making the enemy despondent and discouraged, seriously threatening the three thousand puppet military strongholds and outposts scattered throughout the south, placing them in a dilemma of advance and retreat. At the same time, it makes the contradiction between the enemy's occupation of land and concentration of troops increasingly acute.
    The commentary said that the movement of guerrillas encircling and attacking enemy strongholds and forcing the enemy to withdraw from strongholds has increasingly consolidated and expanded the liberated areas. The liberated areas have developed into villages connected to villages and townships connected to townships. The commentary concluded by saying that the great achievements recently made by the South Vietnamese guerrillas in encircling and attacking puppet military strongholds and outposts and tightening the anti-American encirclement show that the South Vietnamese guerrillas are both brave and resourceful, and become stronger as they fight. With the full support of the People's Liberation Army and the people, the guerrillas can still achieve great victories in any place, even in the dry season, when the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs are full of "hope for victory," and the "ideal" season for various military activities of the enemy.

    南越游击队形成强大的歼美包围圈
    越《人民军队报》说南越游击战争迅猛发展使美伪军成为瓮中之鳖
    新华社河内九日电  越南《人民军队报》八日发表评论指出，由于游击战争的蓬勃发展和歼美包围圈的迅速形成，美伪军的据点已经成为越南南方人民战争海洋中的孤岛，陷于进退两难、被动挨打的困境，随时都有灭顶之灾。
    评论说，在一九六五—一九六六年的旱季中，使美国侵略者及其走狗最头痛和最被动的问题之一，就是从广治、承天到金瓯，包括山区和平原地区的一系列据点和哨所，受到游击队的包围和进攻。仅在南部西区，游击队在今年头三个月中就包围了敌人的十个军事支区和二十九个据点、哨所，迫使敌人撤出一个军事支区和十二个据点、哨所，歼灭和瓦解敌人一千四百多名。
    评论说，由于游击战争的发展和歼美包围圈的形成，许多地方的游击队能够成月地连续包围敌人的据点和哨所，切断敌人所有的供应联络线，使它们成为瓮中鳖，笼中鸟。在人民的支持和地方部队的配合下，游击队既打败了突围的敌人，又击退了敌人的援军。不仅能够继续紧缩包围圈，而且还能歼灭大批敌人的有生力量。
    评论谈到，在包围和袭击敌人据点的战斗中，人民作出了重大的贡献。他们不但同游击队一起不分昼夜地修筑战斗工事，让游击队用自己的田园作包围敌人的阵地，而且还成群结队地涌进县城或省会，同伪政权展开激烈的斗争。他们还同游击队一起动员伪军士兵脱离敌人的队伍，回家生产或投向革命。
    评论说，在这种情况下，被包围的伪军士兵越来越多地逃跑。仅土龙木省明和伪军事训练营在被包围的三个月时间里，就有两百八十名士兵开了小差。
    评论指出，这是游击战争的新发展。南方游击队已经从过去的保卫村庄、消耗和消灭敌人，发展到连续进攻，包围敌人的据点、哨所，打击敌人赖以统治人民的主要工具——地方上的“保安队”和“民卫队”。
    评论说，游击队这种就地歼敌的打法非常厉害。它高度发挥了人民在战争中的作用，只要用很小一部分力量，就可以牵制住敌人的大量军队，而且还能把其它地方的敌人调来，加以消耗和消灭，为解放军集中力量在其它地方狠狠地打击敌人并取得辉煌的战果创造条件。同时，这也是一种使敌人消沉和气馁的打法，严重地威胁着遍布于整个南方的三千个伪军据点和哨所，使它们处于进退两难的困境之中。同时使敌人在占领土地和集中兵力之间的矛盾越来越尖锐。
    评论说，游击队包围、进攻敌人的据点和迫使敌人撤离据点的运动，使解放区日益得到巩固和扩大。解放区已经发展成为村连着村，乡连着乡。评论最后说，越南南方游击队最近在包围、进攻伪军据点、哨所和紧缩歼美包围圈方面取得的巨大成绩表明：南越游击队既勇敢又机智，愈打愈强。由于得到解放军和人民的全力支持，游击队在任何一个地方，甚至是在美国侵略者及其走狗充满“胜利希望”的旱季，敌人各种军事活动的“理想”季节中，仍然可以取得巨大胜利。
