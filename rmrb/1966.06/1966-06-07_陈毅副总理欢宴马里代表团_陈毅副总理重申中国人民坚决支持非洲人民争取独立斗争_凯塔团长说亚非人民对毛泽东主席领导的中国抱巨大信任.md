    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a banquet tonight welcoming the Malian delegation led by Minister Mamadou Madeira Keita, reaffirmed that the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of African countries to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism; and firmly support some countries that have achieved independence to build independent national economies based on the principle of self-reliance, and provide possible and necessary assistance.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people's principled stance has been opposed, slandered, and attacked by imperialism and reactionaries of all countries. This precisely proves that we are doing the right thing and doing it well. The Chinese people will unswervingly continue to do so, and will never retreat a single step, until the national liberation cause of the people of African countries achieves final and complete victory.
    Minister Mamadou Madeira Keita also delivered a warm and friendly speech at the banquet. He said that the Malian people are proud of the great achievements of China's socialist construction, and the Malian people are fortunate to oppose imperialism and colonialism together with the Chinese people. The Chinese people have many friends in the world. He emphasized that some African leaders, standing on the position of neo-colonialism, pursue anti-China policies. I want to say that these Africans cannot speak for the people, because the African people and the Asian people have great trust in China under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The Malian delegation, led by Mamadou Madeira Keita, member of the Political Bureau of the Sudanese Union Party of Mali and Minister of Justice, was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in our country at the banquet held by Vice Premier Chen Yi tonight. The hosts and guests raised their glasses to warmly wish the friendship between the people of China and Mali to continue to develop.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech at the beginning of the banquet that the friendship between the people of China and Mali is a friendship of unity against imperialism. Such a friendship has great vitality. The friendly cooperative relations between our two countries are based on mutual respect, complete equality, and mutual support, and have broad prospects for development.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the achievements made by the Republic of Mali under the leadership of President Modibo Keita. He condemned imperialism headed by the United States and old and new colonialism for continuously instigating military coups and subversive activities in some African countries. He said that the perverse acts of imperialism can temporarily stir up a countercurrent, but they can never stop the mainstream of the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. As long as the African people strengthen unity and persist in struggle, they will surely be able to overcome all difficulties on the road ahead and achieve great victories in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.
    Minister Madeira Keita then spoke. He said that our party and our government congratulate the People's China on the great achievements it has made in building a new life and building socialism, and we hail the victory of China's recent nuclear test. We believe that a country like People's China possessing nuclear weapons is a guarantee for defending and maintaining peace.
    He said that the common struggle against imperialism and against colonialism connects us with China. Mali is fortunate to have this brotherly relationship with China.
    He said that the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism, and the Chinese people have countless friends in the world. Although there are also some reactionaries and imperialists who hate China to the bone, the people of African countries have great trust in the Chinese people, great trust in the People's Republic of China, and great trust in the outstanding leaders of the Chinese party and country.
    He said that the people of Mali and the people of African countries have drawn great lessons from China's experience. China has led us to the broad road and correctly urged us to rely on our own strength first.
    Minister Madeira Keita said that the assistance that China gives to Mali and other countries in the world is completely selfless. Chinese diplomatic representatives and personnel sent to our countries respect our people and our systems very much. In Mali, the Chinese personnel who help us in construction conscientiously complete their tasks. They have set an example for us in terms of exerting their energy, their work responsibility, and their wholehearted devotion to doing their job well.
    Malian Ambassador to China, Gesse Tidiani, and envoys from other African countries to China were invited to attend the banquet. Also present at the banquet were Yang Xiufeng, President of the Supreme People's Court, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Kong Yuan, Wang Daohan, Li Yingji, Liu Xiwu, Zhang Tiesheng, Wang Kunlun and other responsible persons from relevant departments.

    陈毅副总理重申中国人民坚决支持非洲人民争取独立斗争
    凯塔团长说亚非人民对毛泽东主席领导的中国抱巨大信任
    新华社六日讯　陈毅副总理今晚在欢迎由马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔部长率领的马里代表团的宴会上重申，中国人民坚决支持非洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的正义斗争；坚决支持一些取得独立的国家，根据自力更生的原则，建设独立的民族经济，并且提供可能的和必要的援助。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民采取这种原则立场，遭到了帝国主义和各国反动派的反对、诬蔑和攻击。这恰好证明我们做得对、做得好。中国人民将坚定不移地这样做下去，决不后退一步，一直到非洲各国人民的民族解放事业取得最后的、完全的胜利。
    马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔部长也在宴会上发表了热情友好的讲话。他说，马里人民因为中国社会主义建设的巨大成就而感到自豪，马里人民因为同中国人民共同反对帝国主义和殖民主义而感到庆幸。中国人民在世界上有许多朋友。他强调说，某些非洲领导人站在新殖民主义的立场推行反华政策，我要说，这些非洲人不能代表人民说话，因为非洲人民和亚洲人民对在毛泽东主席领导下的中国抱有巨大的信任。
    由马里苏丹联盟党政治局委员、司法部长马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔率领的马里代表团，今晚在陈毅副总理举行的宴会上，受到我国各方面人士的热烈欢迎。宾主举杯热烈祝愿中马两国人民的友谊不断发展。
    陈毅副总理在宴会开始的时候讲话，他说，中马两国人民的友谊是团结反帝的友谊。这样的友谊具有伟大的生命力。我们两国之间的友好合作关系，是建立在互相尊重、完全平等和相互支持的基础上的，是有着广阔发展前途的。
    陈毅副总理赞扬马里共和国在莫迪博·凯塔总统的领导下所取得的成就。他谴责以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义在一些非洲国家连续策动军事政变和颠覆活动。他说，帝国主义的倒行逆施，可以一时掀起一股逆流，但是，绝不能阻挡非洲人民反帝革命斗争的主流。只要非洲人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够克服前进道路上的一切困难，在反帝革命斗争中取得伟大的胜利。
    马戴拉·凯塔部长接着讲话。他说，我们党和我国政府对人民中国在建设新生活和建设社会主义方面所取得的伟大成就表示祝贺，我们欢呼中国最近进行核试验所取得的胜利。我们认为，象人民中国这样的国家拥有核武器，是保卫和维护和平的保证。
    他说，反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的共同斗争，把我们同中国连结在一起。马里由于同中国有这种兄弟般的关系而感到庆幸。
    他说，中国人民和中华人民共和国坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义，中国人民在世界上有无数的朋友。虽然也有一些反动派和帝国主义者对中国恨之入骨，但是非洲各国人民对中国人民有巨大的信任，对中华人民共和国有巨大的信任，对中国的党和国家的杰出领导人有巨大的信任。
    他说，马里人民和非洲各国人民从中国的经验中汲取了巨大的教益，中国使我们走上了康庄大道，正确地敦促我们首先依靠自己的力量。
    马戴拉·凯塔部长说，中国给予马里和世界其他国家的援助完全是无私的。中国的外交代表以及派到我们这些国家的工作人员，都非常尊重我们的人民和我们的体制。在马里，帮助我们建设的中国工作人员兢兢业业地完成任务，他们在发挥干劲、工作责任心以及一心一意做好工作方面，都给我们树立了榜样。
    马里驻中国大使吉塞·提迪亚尼，非洲其他国家驻中国的使节，应邀出席了宴会。出席宴会作陪的，有最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，以及孔原、汪道涵、李应吉、刘希文、张铁生、王昆仑等有关方面负责人。
