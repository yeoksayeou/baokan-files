    The excerpts of incoming submissions criticizing the reactionary film "Adversity Miles Away" published here vividly demonstrate that the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought possess the highest level of awareness and the sharpest eyes. They are not only keenly perceptive and best at recognizing the ugly faces of demons and monsters, but also the most courageous warriors of the proletariat, with the greatest determination and strength to repel the frenzied attacks of all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
    Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and only the people, are the driving force in the making of world history." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the creators and witnesses of history. They are most qualified to expose and criticize those counter-revolutionary elements who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Their articles possess a strong combativeness.
    We warmly welcome more worker, peasant, and soldier comrades to take up their pens and join the ranks of battle, wield the mighty cudgel, clear away the dust for ten thousand miles, and beat all demons and monsters to a pulp.

    这里发表的几篇批判反动影片《逆风千里》的来稿摘要，生动地表明了：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，觉悟最高、眼睛最亮。他们不但嗅觉灵敏、最善于识别牛鬼蛇神的丑恶面目，而且是无产阶级最勇敢的战士，最有决心和力量击退一切反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”广大工农兵群众，他们是历史的创造者，也是历史的见证人。他们最有资格揭露和批判那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命分子。他们的文章，具有强烈的战斗性。
    我们热烈地欢迎更多的工农兵同志拿起笔杆子，投入到战斗的行列中来，奋起千钧棒，澄清万里埃，把一切牛鬼蛇神，打得落花流水。
