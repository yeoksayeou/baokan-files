    Wholeheartedly Serving the People
    Comrade Dervish, Minister of Health of the Albanian Ministry of Defense, recently responded to the Labor Party's call to go deep into the grassroots and vigorously build up mountainous areas, and was sent to the remote Brada mountain area as a doctor. The people of Brada welcomed Dervish's arrival with excitement.
    There is a reason why Comrade Dervish received such a warm welcome. It was in 1942, also in early spring, that Dervish, as a doctor of the Fifth Assault Brigade of the Albanian guerrillas, came to Brada. In those days when the Albanian people heroically resisted the German and Italian fascist bandits, Dervish, carrying an old medicine box containing a small amount of medicines seized from the enemy, crossed mountains and ridges, braving dangers, regardless of wind and rain, and defying severe cold and scorching heat, doing everything possible to heal the wounded and rescue the dying for the guerrillas and relieve the pain of the local residents. It was during these years of sharing weal and woe that Dervish established a deep friendship with the people of the Brada mountain area.
    Returning to the Revolutionary Base
    More than twenty years later, Dervish, now with white hair, has once again come to settle down in the place where he fought, full of revolutionary enthusiasm. He is determined to dedicate all his energy to the people of this old revolutionary base.
    Brada is a remote mountain village in southern Albania. The Çika Mountains, more than two thousand meters above sea level, separate the dozen or so villages in the valley from the plains like a huge screen. There is only a small hospital here.
    After Dervish came to Brada Hospital, he immediately devoted all his efforts to medical work serving the people. Whether it was day or night, whether it was windy or rainy, he would see patients at any time; as soon as he heard that someone was sick and needed treatment, he would carry his medicine box and rush to that place. His medical attitude and style have been praised by the people.
    Late at night on March 2, as the hospital staff were preparing to go to bed, a burst of hurried knocking sounded. Farmer Bahraij from Sharres Village burst in breathlessly, asking the old doctor to quickly save his only daughter who had suddenly developed a high fever and was unconscious. It was pouring rain outside, and the night was pitch black. It took two and a half hours to walk from the hospital to Sharres Village. Dervish's assistant, Lek, offered to go on the house call in place of the old doctor, but Dervish insisted on going himself. He leaned on a wooden stick, braved the heavy rain, and stepped through the mud that reached his ankles, and rushed to Bahraij's home. After emergency medical measures, this little life was saved.
    Enthusiastically Serving the Farmers
    One day, an old farmer from Telabas Village used a small donkey to send his daughter-in-law, who was about to give birth, to Brada Hospital, requesting the hospital to help with the delivery. His daughter-in-law had given birth last year, and the baby died in the womb before it was born. This incident made the old farmer, who was eager to have a grandson, uneasy. Dervish immediately called Vlorë, a nearby city, to request an ambulance. But unfortunately, the phone malfunctioned at this time, and the pregnant woman's labor pains were intensifying. Therefore, Dervish decisively helped the pregnant woman into the ward and personally delivered the baby for her. Before long, the sound of a baby's cry came from the room. The baby was safely born, and it was even twins, a boy and a girl. The old farmer was so excited that he couldn't speak. He hugged Dervish and kissed him warmly.
    Once, Dervish finished a house call in another village and it was already 11 p.m. On his way back, he suddenly heard a wheezing sound caused by respiratory obstruction by the roadside. He followed the sound and found an old man suffering from an asthma attack and being tortured by illness. Therefore, he quickly helped the old man to the hospital, gave him injections and medicine, and took care of him carefully.
    Dervish also took advantage of the opportunity to attend meetings in a certain village or production team to provide free medical treatment to people before and after the meetings.
    Dervish is a doctor, but he often tells people in the hospital that doctors should not only treat diseases, but also care about and help patients ideologically and politically at all times. When seeing patients, he often pays attention to observing and studying the patient's psychological state. Some patients' conditions are not very serious, but their mental burden is very heavy; some patients have been tortured by pain for a long time and have lost confidence. Comrade Dervish prescribed the right medicine, relieved their mental burden through cordial conversations with the patients, and ideologically strengthened their confidence and strength to resist the disease. He also helped some elderly women to break superstitious ideas and transformed them from being suspicious of ghosts and gods to believing in the power of medicine.
    "I am a member of the Labor Party"
    Doctor Dervish is a member of the Labor Party. He never forgets to carry out mass political and ideological work at all times. After the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party published an open letter to the people of the whole country, he took the letter to participate in various meetings, explained the spirit of the letter, and mobilized the people to work hard to realize the party's revolutionary measures. And he himself, like a warrior, responded to the party's call and threw himself into the mass revolutionary movement. Mountain life is relatively hard, but he strictly demands himself and shares weal and woe with everyone. He often repeatedly tells the comrades in the hospital about the party's teaching of bearing hardships before enjoying comforts, and influences and drives others with his own exemplary actions. In his dormitory, there is only a bed and a desk, the furnishings are extremely simple, but his daily work and life are full of revolutionary vigor.
    Dervish is particularly concerned about the growth of the younger generation. When the youth of Vlorë marched along the route fought by the Fifth Assault Brigade, he, as an old soldier of this brigade, immediately went to tell them about the deeds of the older generation fighting for the independence and freedom of the motherland, and asked them to follow in the footsteps of the revolutionary predecessors. He also uses the evening time to conduct revolutionary traditional education for the young people in the village, teaching them not to forget the past. The young people in the village formed a choir, and he was elected as the chairman of the choir, singing revolutionary songs with the young people.
    Dervish is always energetic from morning till night doing all kinds of work, and his strength seems to never run out. What is the source of his strength? People can find the answer in one of his words: "I am not only a doctor, but also a member of the Labor Party. Serving the people is my greatest glory and happiness."

    一心为人民
    阿尔巴尼亚国防部卫生部部长德尔维什同志，不久前响应劳动党深入基层、大力建设山区的号召，下放到偏僻的布拉达山区当医生。布拉达人怀着激动的心情欢迎德尔维什的到来。
    德尔维什同志受到人们热烈的欢迎，不是没有原因的。那是在一九四二年，也是在初春，德尔维什作为阿尔巴尼亚游击队第五突击旅的一名医生，来到了布拉达。在那些阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇抗击德、意法西斯匪徒的日子里，德尔维什背着一个旧药箱，里面装着数量不多的从敌人手中缴获来的药品，翻山越岭，出生入死，不管风吹雨淋，不畏严寒酷暑，千方百计为游击队救死扶伤，为当地居民解除病痛。就在这患难与共的岁月里，德尔维什同布拉达山区的人民建立了深厚的情谊。
    回到革命根据地
    二十多年后的今天，已经是白发斑斑的德尔维什，又满怀革命热情，再次来到他战斗过的地方安家落户。他决心要把自己的全部精力，贡献给这个老革命根据地的人民。
    布拉达是阿尔巴尼亚南部的一个边远山乡。拔海两千多米的齐卡山脉，象一扇巨大的屏风把山沟里十几个村落同平原地区隔开。这里只有一所小小的医院。
    德尔维什来到布拉达医院以后，立即把全部力量投入了为人民服务的医疗工作中去。不管是白天黑夜，不管是风天雨天，只要有人来看病，他都随时接诊；一听到那里有人生病待治，他就背起药箱奔向那里。他的医疗态度和作风，受到了人们的称赞。
    三月二日深夜，医院的人已经准备就寝，这时响起了一阵急促的敲门声。夏勒斯村的农民巴赫拉伊气喘吁吁地闯了进来，请老医生快去拯救他的那位突然发高烧昏迷不省的独生女儿。这时外面正在下着瓢泼大雨，又是伸手不见五指的夜晚。从医院到夏勒斯村要走两个半小时的路程。德尔维什的助手列克表示要代替老医生出诊，但是，德尔维什坚不肯让，他拄了根木棍，冒着大雨，踏着深没脚踝的泥泞，赶到了巴赫拉伊的家。经过紧急的医疗措施，这个小生命得救了。
    为农民热心服务
    有一天，泰拉巴斯村一个老农民用小毛驴把就要临产的儿媳送到布拉达医院来，请求医院帮助接生。他的儿媳去年分娩，婴儿还没有出世就在母胎里死去了，这件事使这个抱孙心切的老农民惴惴不安。德尔维什立即打电话给附近的发罗拉市，请求派急救车来。可真不巧，就在这个时候电话发生了故障，而孕妇阵痛又在加紧。于是，德尔维什当机立断，把孕妇扶进了病室，亲自为她接生。不多久，室内就传出了婴儿的呱呱叫声，婴儿安全地生下来了，而且还是一男一女的双胞胎。老农民激动得说不出话来，他抱住了德尔维什热烈亲吻。
    有一次，德尔维什到外村出诊完毕已是夜里十一点了。他在归途中突然听到路旁有因呼吸阻塞而发出的气喘声。他循声寻去，发现一位老人气喘病发作，正在经受病魔的折磨。于是，他赶忙把老人扶到医院，给他打针服药，细心照看。
    德尔维什还利用到某一个村或生产队参加会议的机会，在会前会后的时间为人们义务看病。
    德尔维什是个医生，但他时常对医院的人说，医生不光要治病，还要时刻从思想上和政治上去关心和帮助病人。他在看病的时候，常常注意观察和研究病人的心理状态。有的病人本来病情并不很严重，但是精神负担很大；有的病人长久地被病痛折磨，已经失去了信心，德尔维什同志“对症下药”，通过同病人的亲切交谈，解除他们的精神负担，从思想上增强了抵御病魔的信心和力量。他还帮助一些老年妇女破除迷信的思想，从疑神疑鬼转变为相信医学的力量。
    “我是劳动党党员”
    德尔维什医生是劳动党党员。他时时都不忘记进行群众政治思想工作。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央致全国人民公开信发表以后，他拿着这封信去参加各种会议，讲解这封信的精神，动员人民去为实现党的革命化措施而努力。而他自己也象一个战士一样，响应党的号召，投入到群众性的革命化运动中去。山区生活是比较艰苦的，但是，他严格要求自己，同大家同甘共苦。他常常向医院的同志反复地讲述党的吃苦在前、享受在后的教导，并以自己的模范行动影响和带动别人。在他的宿舍里，只有一张床和一张办公桌，陈设极为简朴，但是他每天的工作和生活却充满了革命的朝气。
    德尔维什特别关心年青一代的成长。当发罗拉青年沿着第五突击旅战斗过的路线行军时，他作为这个旅的老战士，立即去为他们讲述老一辈人为祖国的独立和自由而战斗的事迹，要他们跟着革命前辈的脚迹前进。他还利用晚上的时间对村里的青年们进行革命传统教育，教他们不要忘记过去。村里的青年人成立了合唱队，他被选为合唱队的主席，同青年人一起大唱革命歌曲。
    德尔维什从早到晚总是精神振奋地做各种工作，他身上的力量似乎永远也用不完。他的这股力量的源泉是什么呢？人们可以从他的一句话里找到答案：“我不仅是一个医生，而且是一个劳动党党员。为人民服务是我的最大的光荣和幸福。”
