    How the Lu Ping Gang Persecuted Volunteer Army Heroes
    Comrade Huang Yougen, born into a hired peasant family, joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army at a very young age and repeatedly performed meritorious service in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In one battle, he was seriously wounded. After recovering from his injuries, the Party sent him to the Honorary Military Personnel Accelerated Middle School and Peking University to study. After entering Peking University, Comrade Huang Yougen studied diligently, determined to conquer the cultural fortress. However, because he had little time for reading and a poor cultural foundation, he encountered difficulties in studying certain courses. The teachers not only did not enthusiastically help him, but also made things difficult for him in every possible way, mocked him, and finally ordered him to withdraw from school.
    Huang Yougen, a student of the 1960 class of the History Department of Peking University, is a Zhuang nationality, a hired peasant, a revolutionary soldier, and a member of the Communist Party of China. From 1942 to 1949, he looked after children and grazed cattle for landlords. In 1949, he joined the guerrillas (at the age of fifteen), and was later incorporated into the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In 1950, he participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. He withstood the test of war in the fierce battles in Korea. Comrade Huang Yougen said: "I am a person with deep roots in bitterness and hatred. Chairman Mao led us to turn over, and we are not afraid of death in making revolution." In every battle, he was in the front, and was awarded two third-class merits and two minor merits.
    In July 1952, the company in which Comrade Huang Yougen was located repelled several large-scale frantic attacks by the enemy in one day, and defended the position. Under the enemy's crazy shelling and the strict blockade by aircraft, he was ordered to take soldiers to transport ammunition through the enemy's layers of blockades. While crossing the enemy's third line of blockade, Comrade Huang Yougen was unfortunately seriously wounded in the head and legs and was sent back to the motherland.
    Comrade Huang Yougen stayed in the hospital for nearly two years. Although the gunshot wounds healed, his body was disabled and he could not return to the army.
    In March 1954, the organization assigned Comrade Huang Yougen to the Guangxi Honorary Military Personnel School to recuperate while studying culture and political theory. Comrade Huang Yougen said: "Studying Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious history of the Party armed my mind. I must firmly remember the bitterness of the class, listen to Chairman Mao's words, never forget my roots, and never change my color."
    Comrade Huang Yougen endured the pain with the hard bone spirit of the proletariat. After more than two years of unyielding study, he reached the cultural level of higher elementary school from being illiterate.
    In August 1956, Comrade Huang Yougen was admitted to the Hunan Honorary Military Personnel Accelerated Middle School. During his studies at the Accelerated Middle School, he participated in the five-month rush repair of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway double track project, and won one major merit and two minor merits.
    Comrade Huang Yougen said: "It was the Party that made me, a poor child, understand revolutionary principles, and it was Chairman Mao who gave me the right to study. I owe my current life to Chairman Mao! The current task assigned to me by the Party is not to fight and kill enemies, but to advance towards culture. I must listen to the Party, have a clear direction and a correct attitude, and strive for the revolutionary cause for the rest of my life. In the past, I was able to repel the attacks of enemies dozens of times my size on the battlefield; today, on the battle line of conquering the cultural fortress, I must achieve new victories."
    Comrade Huang Yougen put his promise into practice with his own actions. He spent more than five years to complete the main courses of primary school and middle school, reaching the level of high school. He was rated as an outstanding student in 1959.
    In July 1960, after graduating from the Hunan Honorary Military Personnel Accelerated Middle School, Comrade Huang Yougen was recommended by the organization to Peking University for further study. He originally applied for the Department of Politics at Peking University. After entering the school, he was assigned to the Department of History. At that time, some worker-peasant students said to him: "You have not systematically studied the courses of middle school, and there will be many difficulties in studying history. You should apply to the Department of Politics!" Comrade Huang Yougen said: "There are difficulties in making revolution. The Party tells me to study what I should study, and studying anything is to serve the people."
    Studying ancient history and foreign languages in the Department of History were his two major difficulties. Teachers did not enthusiastically help him, but made things difficult for him in every possible way. The Russian teacher knew that Comrade Huang Yougen was a minority student and had difficulty with pronunciation, so he ridiculed him in class. When the teacher asked questions in class, Comrade Huang Yougen could not answer well, so the teacher would not let him sit down, but called a student from an exploitative class to answer for him. Once, the teacher wrote the words "leader" in Russian on the blackboard and asked Comrade Huang Yougen to answer. He did not answer, and the teacher ridiculed him on the spot, saying, "You are a worker-peasant student, and you don't even know the leader." After class, the teacher ran to the History Department office and said, "Huang Yougen's learning purpose is not clear, his attitude is not correct, and he can't answer the questions." The next day, the History Department's academic officer called Huang Yougen and severely criticized him.
    Comrade Huang Yougen said at the branch meeting: "I can endure the teacher criticizing me for not studying well and my purpose is not clear. I cannot agree with saying that I don't even know the leader. I really wanted to cry at the time, but I thought that I was a Communist Party member and had to withstand the test." Comrades were very sympathetic to him after hearing what he said.
    The teacher of Chinese Ancient History openly said to the students: "As soon as I see Huang Yougen's name, I know he is 'two points'." Comrade Huang Yougen went to the teacher for tutoring, but the teacher said impatiently, "Go back and read *Zuo Zhuan* again." Huang Yougen said, "There are some places I don't understand." The teacher said, "You are really stupid, forget it if you don't understand." After that, Comrade Huang Yougen did not dare to go to the teacher for tutoring if he had any questions.
    In order not to let down the Party's concern and cultivation, Comrade Huang Yougen studied very hard. He rarely went to see movies, and never rested on Sundays. He often studied in the dormitory with candles lit. Sometimes, for fear of affecting the rest of his classmates, he went to study under the street lights or in the toilet.
    In the second year of Comrade Huang Yougen's entry into Peking University, his wife died, leaving two children at home. The classmates advised him to ask for leave to go back and see them, but Comrade Huang Yougen said with tears in his eyes: "My studies are so poor, I am always criticized by the teacher, and I can't complete the learning task, how can I go home?" At that time, many classmates were moved to tears by his strong perseverance. The students discussed one after another that Comrade Huang Yougen was indeed an excellent Communist Party member and a great volunteer soldier.
    Comrade Huang Yougen had made the greatest efforts in his studies. However, in the summer vacation of 1961, under the guise of so-called "strict requirements" and "improving teaching quality," the school stubbornly held Comrade Huang Yougen back because he had not passed Chinese Ancient History, Ancient Chinese, and Russian, and made a decision to repeat a grade.
    In order to concentrate his efforts to study professional courses well and better serve the Party, in October 1961, Comrade Huang Yougen once again requested to be exempted from or postpone studying Russian. At that time, the people in the department office said to him: "If you really have difficulties, you don't have to attend Russian class." However, two months later, the department office told him again that the school did not agree to exempt him from studying Russian, and asked him to quickly go to class with the class. Comrade Huang Yougen originally had difficulty learning Russian, and he had missed two months of class, so how could he keep up?
    The semester exam came again. Under the teacher's making things difficult, Comrade Huang Yougen again failed Chinese Ancient History and Russian.
    On September 18, 1962, the school actually ordered Huang Yougen to withdraw from school! And notified him to go through the school leaving procedures immediately. After the notice was issued, the director of the History Department office believed that Comrade Huang Yougen was a volunteer army hero from a hired peasant family. Although his foundation was poor, his position was firm, his study was diligent, and his research was assiduous. He was exactly the person we should train. It was very inappropriate to order him to withdraw from school now. Therefore, he withheld the notice and did not talk to Comrade Huang Yougen about withdrawing from school for a long time, and still let him go to class with the class.
    On November 15, 1962, Lu Ping and others went to the Ministry of Education to report on the situation of Peking University's handling of students who withdrew from school and repeated grades that year. They said that some students at Peking University withdrew from school because they had not attended regular high school in the past, and their foundations were too poor, and cited Huang Yougen as an example. Lu Ping also said: "Huang Yougen only became literate in 1956, and entered Peking University in 1960. How did this happen! There is no other way to deal with this kind of student except to withdraw from school. It is impossible to force him to attend class."
    In late November 1962, the director of the History Department office found a person in charge of the school and asked to change the decision to withdraw Comrade Huang Yougen from school and let him stay in school to continue his studies. But this person in charge remained indifferent and insisted that Huang Yougen withdraw from school. Later, the director of the History Department office talked to another person, but it still didn't work.
    The director of the History Department office had no choice but to mobilize Comrade Huang Yougen to withdraw from school. Comrade Huang Yougen was very sad when he heard that the school was determined to have him withdraw from school.
    On November 27, 1962, Comrade Huang Yougen wrote a long report to the school with tears in his eyes, pleading to stay in school to continue his studies. In the report, he talked about his life experience and expressed his determination to study hard. On December 13, 1962, the director of the History Department office also wrote a report to Lu Ping and others. The report said: "In the past, the department leaders did not give enough care and help to Comrade Huang Yougen... We guarantee to assign teachers to Comrade Huang Yougen in the future and strengthen tutoring so that he can graduate on schedule." He once again asked the school to keep Comrade Huang Yougen and continue to attend classes. But the reply he received was: "This student is a transferred cadre student, he only became literate in 1956, and he has repeated the first grade twice, both times failing Russian and Ancient History. Now he is going to repeat the grade for the second time, which not only does not conform to the Ministry of Education's regulations on academic assessment, but also will be difficult to graduate. Therefore, we maintain the original decision unchanged."
    In early 1963, Comrade Huang Yougen was finally forced by the anti-Party gang to leave Peking University and return to his hometown to graze cattle for the production team. At that time, the school originally promised to arrange a job for Comrade Huang Yougen and let him wait for the notice at home. However, after Comrade Huang Yougen left school, the school ignored him.
    Under the rule of the Lu Ping gang at Peking University, outstanding sons and daughters of the Party like Comrade Huang Yougen were driven out of the gates of Peking University one by one. Look! How sinister and vicious these anti-Party elements are! This is a major crime of the bourgeoisie exercising dictatorship over the proletariat. Under the leadership of the work team and the new school Party committee, we must resolutely and thoroughly overthrow this group of monsters and demons!
    In the great socialist education movement, Comrade Huang Yougen returned to Peking University again in February 1965 and restored his student status.

    陆平黑帮是怎样迫害志愿军功臣的
    黄有根同志雇农出身，很小就参加了中国人民解放军，在抗美援朝战争中屡立战功。在一次战斗中，身负重伤。伤愈后，党送他到荣誉军人速成中学和北京大学学习。黄有根同志入北大后，刻苦学习，决心攻克文化堡垒。但是，由于他读书时间较少，文化基础较差，学习某些课程遇到困难。教师不仅不热情帮助，反而百般刁难，嘲讽他，最后竟勒令他退学。
    北京大学历史系六○级学生黄有根，壮族，雇农，革命军人，中国共产党党员。一九四二年至一九四九年给地主看小孩、放牛。一九四九年参加游击队（当时十五岁），后编入中国人民解放军。一九五○年参加抗美援朝。在朝鲜激烈的战斗中，他经受了战火的考验。黄有根同志说：“我是一个苦大仇深的人，毛主席领导我们翻了身，干革命就不怕死。”在每次战斗中，他都是冲在前面，立过两次三等功，两次小功。
    一九五二年七月，黄有根同志所在的连队，一天打退了敌人几次大规模的猖狂进攻，保住了阵地。在敌人疯狂的炮击和飞机严密封锁的情况下，他奉命带着战士，通过敌人层层的封锁线，去抢运弹药。在冲越敌人第三道封锁线时，黄有根同志不幸头部和腿负了重伤，被送回祖国。
    黄有根同志在医院住了将近两年，枪伤虽然好了，但身体却残废了，不能重返部队。
    一九五四年三月，组织上分配黄有根同志到广西荣誉军人学校，一边养伤，一边学习文化和政治理论。黄有根同志说：“通过学习毛泽东思想和党的光辉历史，武装了我的头脑。我要牢记阶级苦，听毛主席的话，永不忘本，永不变色。”
    黄有根同志用无产阶级的硬骨头精神，忍受着伤痛，经过了两年多的顽强学习，由文盲达到了高小文化程度。
    一九五六年八月，黄有根同志考入了湖南荣誉军人速成中学。在速成中学学习期间，曾参加了五个月的抢修京广线复路工程，立大功一次，小功两次。
    黄有根同志说：“是党使我这个穷孩子懂得了革命道理，是毛主席给了我学习的权利。我能有今天的生活，都是托毛主席的福啊！当前党交给我的任务不是打仗杀敌，而是向文化进军。我要听党的话，方向明，态度正，为革命事业奋斗一生。过去，在战场上能打退几十倍于我的敌人的进攻；今天，在攻克文化堡垒的战线上，一定要取得新的胜利。”
    黄有根同志以自己的行动实践了自己的诺言。他用五年多的时间，就学完了小学、中学的主要课程，达到了高中水平。一九五九年曾被评为优秀学生。
    一九六○年七月，黄有根同志在湖南荣誉军人速成中学毕业后，组织上保送他到北大继续深造。他原来报的是北大政治系。入学后，学校分配他到历史系。当时，有些工农学生对他说：“你没有系统学过中学的课程，学历史会有许多困难，你还是申请到政治系去吧！黄有根同志却说：“干革命就有困难，党让学啥就学啥，学什么都是为人民服务。”
    在历史系学习古代史、外语，是他的两大难关。教师不热情帮助他，反而百般刁难他。俄语课教师明知黄有根同志是少数民族学生，发音有困难，就在课堂上嘲弄他。上课时，教员提出的问题，黄有根同志答不好，教员不让他坐下，另叫一个剥削阶级出身的学生答给他听。有一次，教员在黑板上用俄文写了“领袖”两字，让黄有根同志答。他没有答出来，教员当场就讽刺他说：“你是工农学生，连领袖都不知道。”下课后，教员跑到历史系办公室说：“黄有根的学习目的不明确，态度不端正，提问也答不好。”第二天，历史系教务员就把黄有根同志找去，狠狠地批评了他一顿。
    黄有根同志在支部会上说：“老师批评我学习不好，目的不明确，我都能忍受。说我连领袖也不知道，我不能同意。当时我真想哭，但想到自己是一个共产党员，要经得住考验。”同志们听了黄有根同志的话，很同情他。
    中国古代史课的教员，公开在同学中说：“一看见黄有根的名字，就知道他是‘二分’。”黄有根同志去找教员给辅导，教员很不耐烦地说：“你回去再看看《左传》。”黄有根说：“我有的地方看不懂。”教员说：“你的脑子真笨，看不懂就算了。”以后，黄有根同志有问题，也不敢再去找教员辅导了。
    黄有根同志为不辜负党的关怀和培养，学习非常努力，很少去看电影，星期日从来也不休息。他经常点着蜡烛在宿舍里学习，有时怕影响同学们的休息，就到路灯下、厕所里去学习。
    黄有根同志入北大的第二年，他的妻子死了，家中留下两个小孩。同学们劝他请假回去看看，黄有根同志却含着眼泪说：“我的学习这么差，总受老师的批评，完成不了学习任务，我怎么能回家。”当时，许多同学都被他这种坚强的毅力感动得掉了泪。同学们纷纷议论，黄有根同志真不愧是一个优秀的共产党员，是一位伟大的志愿军战士。
    黄有根同志在学习上是尽了最大的努力的。然而，一九六一年暑假，学校却在所谓“严格要求”和“提高教学质量”的幌子下，硬卡着黄有根同志中国古代史、古代汉语、俄语没有通过，作了留级处理。
    为了集中力量将专业课学好，更好地为党工作，一九六一年十月，黄有根同志再次请求免修或者缓修俄语。当时系办公室的人对他说：“实在有困难，你就不用上俄语课了。”可是，过了两个月，系办公室又告诉他说，学校不同意他免修俄语，又要他赶快去跟班上课。黄有根同志本来学俄语就很困难，又缺了两个月课，这怎么能跟得上呢？
    学期考试又来了。黄有根同志在教员的刁难下，中国古代史、俄语，又没有通过。
    一九六二年九月十八日，学校竟然勒令黄有根退学！并通知他要马上办理离校手续。通知下达后，历史系办公室主任认为，黄有根同志是一个雇农出身的志愿军功臣。他的基础虽差，但立场坚定，学习努力，刻苦钻研，正是我们应该培养的人，现在勒令他退学很不妥当。因此，将通知扣压，迟迟没有向黄有根同志谈退学的问题，照样让他去跟班上课。
    一九六二年十一月十五日，陆平等去教育部汇报当年北大处理退学、留级学生的情况。他们说，北大有些学生退学，原因是他们过去没有上过正规高中，基础太差，并且举了黄有根的例子。陆平还说：“黄有根一九五六年才扫盲，一九六○年就上北大，这是怎么搞的！这种学生不作退学处理，没有别的办法，勉强跟班是不行的。”
    一九六二年十一月下旬，历史系办公室主任找到学校的一位负责人，要求改变对黄有根同志的退学处理，让他留校继续学习。但这位负责人却无动于衷，仍然坚持要黄有根退学。后来，历史系办公室主任又找到另外一个人谈，仍然不行。
    历史系办公室主任没有办法，只好去动员黄有根同志退学。黄有根同志听说学校坚决要他退学，心里非常难过。
    一九六二年十一月二十七日，黄有根同志流着泪给学校写了一个长篇报告，恳求留校继续学习。在报告中，他谈了自己的生平，并且表示决心努力学习。一九六二年十二月十三日，历史系办公室主任也给陆平等写了报告。报告中说：“过去系领导上对黄有根同志关怀和帮助不够……保证今后给黄有根同志配备教师，加强辅导，使他能够按期毕业。”再次要求学校把黄有根同志留下来，继续跟班学习。可是得到的答复是：“该生系调干学生，一九五六年才扫盲，已留级读过两次一年级，均是俄语、古代史不及格，现在要第二次留级，不仅不符合教育部的成绩考核规程，而且读至毕业也困难，因此维持原决定不变。”
    一九六三年初，黄有根同志终于在反党黑帮的逼迫下，离开了北大，回乡给生产队放牛去了。当时，学校本来答应给黄有根同志安排工作，让他在家等候通知。可是，黄有根同志离校后，学校就不管不问了。
    北京大学在陆平等黑帮的统治下，象黄有根同志这样的党的优秀儿女，竟一个一个地被赶出北大的校门。看！这些反党分子是多么阴险恶毒啊！这是资产阶级对无产阶级实行专政的一大罪证。我们要在工作组和新的学校党委领导下，坚决彻底打倒这群牛鬼蛇神！
    在伟大的社会主义教育运动中，黄有根同志于一九六五年二月又重新返回北大，恢复了学籍。
