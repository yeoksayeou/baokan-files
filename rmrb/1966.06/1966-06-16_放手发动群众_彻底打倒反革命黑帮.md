    Unleash the Masses and Thoroughly Overthrow the Counter-Revolutionary Black Gang
    The revolutionary students, workers, and teachers of Nanjing University have exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary element Kuang Yaming, a truly gratifying event.
    The reorganization of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, removing those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements from their posts and seizing their power, is also a truly gratifying event.
    Recently, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, charging into all bourgeois stubborn strongholds, and achieving one victory after another.
    What does the counter-revolutionary incident of Kuang Yaming suppressing the revolutionary mass movement tell us?
    It tells us that these demons and monsters, these anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary black gangs, will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history, nor will they willingly accept their defeat. They will inevitably put up a stubborn resistance, inevitably make a desperate struggle, and inevitably adopt all kinds of insidious and vicious means to suppress the revolutionary mass movement and maintain their tottering counter-revolutionary rule.
    The anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives steal the name of the Party and use many departments under their control as bases for carrying out anti-Party activities. They use a whole set of tools of dictatorship to deal with the revolutionary masses and the proletarian left. They are organized, planned, and led to resist the Great Cultural Revolution launched by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. As soon as the movement began, before the masses were mobilized, they stirred up dark winds, spread rumors, created chaos, shifted targets, and set up numerous obstacles to tie the hands and feet of the masses. As soon as the proletarian left spoke and posted a few big-character posters, they flew into a rage, threw a fit of hysteria, besieged and attacked the left-wing organizations, hurled abuse and threats, and fabricated charges to carry out political persecution. These fellows have a strange logic: whoever exposes them and opposes their black gang is said to be "anti-Party" and "anti-Central Committee." The result of their doing so is precisely the opposite of their wishes, completely exposing the true faces of these royalist party members and counter-revolutionary parties, and sounding the death knell for their complete collapse.
    This Cultural Revolution, for those departments and units whose leadership has been usurped by bourgeois representatives, is a struggle for power, a struggle to transform the bourgeois dictatorship into a proletarian dictatorship. This struggle must not adopt reformist methods, must not engage in "peaceful transition," must not engage in "two combining into one," but must adopt thorough revolutionary methods, must drag out all demons and monsters, and struggle against them until they are discredited, defeated, and overthrown.
    To win this struggle, we must boldly mobilize the masses. What attitude to take towards the mass movement, whether to support or oppose it, is an extremely important sign distinguishing between revolution and counter-revolution. We should enthusiastically and wholeheartedly support the revolutionary mass movement, actively participate in this movement, and correctly guide this movement. We must firmly rely on the proletarian left, with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force of the revolution, unite more than 95 percent of the people and more than 95 percent of the cadres, concentrate our firepower, concentrate our targets, and fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, fire on the bourgeois stubborn strongholds, and fire on all demons and monsters.
    Revolutionary big-character posters are a mirror that reveals all demons and monsters, and are the most effective way to boldly mobilize the masses to launch a fierce attack on the enemy. All anti-Party and

    放手发动群众　彻底打倒反革命黑帮
    南京大学革命学生、职工和教师，揪出了反党反社会主义的反革命分子匡亚明，这是一件大快人心的事。
    改组共青团北京市委，罢了那些反党反社会主义分子的官，夺了他们的权，也是一件大快人心的事。
    最近以来，广大工农兵，广大革命干部，广大革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大闹无产阶级文化革命，向一切资产阶级顽固堡垒，冲锋陷阵，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    匡亚明镇压革命群众运动的反革命事件，告诉我们什么呢？
    它告诉我们，匡亚明这些牛鬼蛇神，这些反党反社会主义的反革命黑帮，是决不会自动退出历史舞台的，是决不会甘心自己的失败的。他们必然要负隅顽抗，必然要作垂死的挣扎，必然要采取种种阴险毒辣的手段，来镇压革命的群众运动，来维持他们摇摇欲坠的反革命统治。
    反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，他们盗窃党的名义，把自己所控制的许多部门，当作进行反党活动的阵地。他们利用一整套专政的工具，来对付革命的群众和无产阶级左派。他们有组织、有计划、有领导地同党中央和毛主席所发动的这场文化大革命相对抗。运动刚刚开始，群众还没有发动起来，他们就刮阴风，造谣言，制造混乱，转移目标，设下重重障碍，束缚群众手脚。无产阶级左派刚一说话，贴上几张大字报，他们就暴跳如雷，歇斯底里大发作，对左派组织围攻，谩骂恐吓，横加罪名，进行政治陷害。这些家伙们有个奇怪的逻辑，谁要揭露他们，谁要反对他们这伙黑帮，就说谁是“反党”、“反中央”。他们这样干的结果，恰恰和他们的愿望相反，完全暴露了他们这些保皇党、反革命党的真面目，也就为他们的彻底垮台敲响了丧钟。
    这场文化大革命，对于那些被资产阶级代表人物篡夺了领导权的部门和单位来说，是一个夺权的斗争，是一个变资产阶级专政为无产阶级专政的斗争。这个斗争，决不能采取改良主义的办法，决不能搞“和平过渡”，决不能搞“合二而一”，而必须采取彻底革命的办法，必须把一切牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒。
    要取得这场斗争的胜利，必须放手发动群众。对群众运动采取什么态度，是支持还是反对，这是区别革命和反革命的一个极为重要的标志。我们应当满腔热情地、全心全意地支持革命的群众运动，积极地投身到这个运动中去，正确地指导这个运动。我们一定要坚定地依靠无产阶级左派，以工农兵为革命的主力军，团结百分之九十五以上的人民群众和百分之九十五以上的干部，集中火力，集中目标，向反党反社会主义黑帮开火，向资产阶级顽固堡垒开火，向一切牛鬼蛇神开火。
    革命的大字报，是揭露一切牛鬼蛇神的照妖镜，是放手发动群众向敌人猛烈冲击的最有效的办法。一切反党反社会主义的反革命分子，都最害怕大字报。一切革命群众，都最喜欢大字报，都把大字报当作揭露和战胜敌人的最强有力的新式武器。你贴一张，我贴一张，什么反党反社会主义的罪行都可以揭发出来，什么反党反社会主义的黑帮都可以揪出来，叫他躲也躲不了，藏也藏不住。我们就是要大搞大字报，大辩论，大鸣大放，大长无产阶级左派和革命群众的志气，大灭资产阶级代表人物、资产阶级“学术权威”和一切牛鬼蛇神的威风。
    对那些资产阶级顽固堡垒，一定要群起而攻之。那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物，他们继续骑在人民的头上作威作福，就要在报纸上点他们的名，撤他们的职，罢他们的官，夺他们的权，坚决进行改组。象坚持反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的前中共北京市委，不改组怎么行呢！象作为前中共北京市委的帮凶、疯狂毒害青少年的前共青团北京市委，不改组怎么行呢！象这些反革命顽固堡垒的头头们，不罢他们的官怎么行呢！
    我们一定要放手发动群众，把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命黑帮统统打倒，把他们盘踞的一切阵地统统夺回来，牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里。
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
