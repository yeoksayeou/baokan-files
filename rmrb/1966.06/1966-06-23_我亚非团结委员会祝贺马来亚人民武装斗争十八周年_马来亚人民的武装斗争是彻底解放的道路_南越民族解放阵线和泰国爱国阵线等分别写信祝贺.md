    Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee recently wrote a letter to the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China on the occasion of the 18th anniversary of the outbreak of the Malayan people's armed struggle on June 20th, extending the highest fraternal respect to the heroic Malayan people and the Malayan National Liberation Army, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle.
    The letter of congratulations, published in a press communique by the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China, stated that the armed struggle launched by the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya on June 20, 1948, against the British imperialists' bloody suppression, opened a new chapter in the cause of national independence in Malaya. For eighteen years, the Malayan people have fought wave upon wave, persisting in their struggle and striking at the British colonialists and their running dogs from all fronts. The path of armed struggle chosen and adhered to by the Malayan people is the correct path for the complete liberation of Malaya; it is also the correct path for the Asian, African, Latin American, and all oppressed people to strive for complete liberation. Your struggle is an indivisible part of the world people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle and a powerful aid to the Vietnamese people who are heroically carrying out the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.
    In its letter of congratulations, the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee reiterated: The Chinese people resolutely support the Malayan people's struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of British imperialism and its running dogs, to achieve genuine independence, freedom, democracy, and peace in Malaya, and resolutely support the Malayan people's struggle to smash "Malaysia" and oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war. The letter expressed its deep belief that the Malayan people will continue to enrich their experience, strengthen their forces, and give full play to the power of people's war in the struggle, pushing the Malayan national liberation movement to a new stage, until finally driving out all imperialist and neo-colonialist forces and realizing the true independence of the motherland.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: June 20th marks the 18th anniversary of the outbreak of the Malayan people's armed struggle against the bloody suppression by British imperialism. The press communique recently issued by the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China published letters of congratulations to the delegation from Tran Van Thanh, head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, Payong Chulanon, Overseas Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and British peace activist Russell.
    Tran Van Thanh, head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in China, pointed out in his letter of congratulation that, during the past eighteen years, despite the brutal persecution and suppression of the Malayan people by British imperialism and the Rahman running dogs, supported by U.S. imperialism, in order to extinguish the Malayan people's patriotic struggle, the Malayan National Liberation League and the people of all walks of life in Malaya, together with the Malayan National Liberation Army, have resolutely and unswervingly launched a struggle to smash "Malaysia" and strive for national independence, democracy, peace, and the unification of the motherland.
    The letter said: "The South Vietnamese people guarantee that in the struggle against the imperialist and colonialist aggressors headed by U.S. imperialism—our common enemy—and for national independence, democracy, peace, and the unification of the motherland, they will always stand on the side of the Malayan people."
    Lieutenant Colonel Payong Chulanon, Overseas Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, in his letter of congratulation, recounted the long, glorious, and heroic history of the Malayan people. The letter pointed out that the Malayan people's struggle entered a new, profound, and correct stage thirty-six years ago after the Malayan working class stepped onto the political stage. This stage is led by the Malayan working class with the Communist Party of Malaya as its core.
    The letter said that the long-term struggle of the Malayan people has not only continued to the present but has also developed in depth and breadth. This proves the truth that in the struggle for national liberation against an enemy who is superior from the beginning, the people must persist in long-term armed struggle, unite all the forces that can be united under the correct leadership of the revolutionary party. Only in this way can the people gain a firm foothold and achieve final victory.
    The letter said that Thailand and Malaya are close neighbors. The people of the two countries share the same fate. The struggle of the Malayan people is also the struggle of the Thai people. The Patriotic Front of Thailand fully supports the eight-point program of the Malayan National Liberation League. We believe that the close cooperation between our two organizations and two delegations for our common cause will steadily develop and continue forever.
    The letter of congratulations from the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee stated that the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions resolutely support the just struggle of the Malayan people to overthrow the reactionary rule of British imperialism and its running dogs, to smash the neo-colonialist tool "Malaysia" supported by U.S. and British imperialism, and to strive for genuine independence, freedom, democracy, and peace in Malaya, and sincerely wish the Malayan people new and greater victories in their anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle.
    Russell's letter of congratulation said: "The struggle for genuine independence in Malaya needs the sincere support of all who oppose the cruel exploitation and suffering brought about by British imperialism. Today, the regime ruling Malaya is merely a puppet regime that submits to the policies of the White House and the British east of Suez. I fully support the Malayan national liberation struggle and firmly believe that only economic and political independence can solve the problems of the Malayan people. The national independence struggle needs the support of all of us."

    我亚非团结委员会祝贺马来亚人民武装斗争十八周年
    马来亚人民的武装斗争是彻底解放的道路
    南越民族解放阵线和泰国爱国阵线等分别写信祝贺
    新华社二十二日讯　中国亚非团结委员会最近就六月二十日马来亚人民武装斗争爆发十八周年写信给马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团，向富有光荣反帝斗争传统的英勇的马来亚人民和马来亚民族解放军致崇高的兄弟的敬意。
    马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团的新闻公报上发表的这封贺信说，马来亚各族人民在一九四八年六月二十日掀起的反对英帝国主义血腥镇压的武装斗争，在马来亚的民族独立事业中揭开了新的一页。十八年来，马来亚人民前赴后继，坚持斗争，从各个战线上打击着英国殖民者及其走狗。马来亚人民所选择并坚持的武装斗争的道路是彻底解放马来亚的正确道路；也是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲及一切被压迫人民争取彻底解放的正确道路，你们的斗争是世界人民反帝革命斗争不可分割的一部分，是对于正在英勇进行抗美救国斗争的越南人民的有力援助。
    中国亚非团结委员会在贺信中重申：中国人民坚决支持马来亚人民推翻英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治、争取实现马来亚的真正独立、自由、民主与和平的斗争，坚决支持马来亚人民粉碎“马来西亚”和反对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的斗争。贺信中表示深信，马来亚人民将不断在斗争中丰富自己的经验、壮大自己的力量，充分发挥人民战争的威力，把马来亚的民族解放运动推向新的阶段，直到最后赶走一切帝国主义与新老殖民主义势力，实现祖国的真正独立。
    据新华社二十二日讯　六月二十日是马来亚人民爆发反对英帝国主义血腥镇压的武装斗争的十八周年。马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团的新闻公报最近发表了越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成、泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会以及英国和平人士罗素给这个代表团的贺信。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长陈文成的贺信中指出，过去十八年间，尽管受美帝国主义支持的英帝国主义和拉赫曼走狗为了扑灭马来亚人民的爱国斗争，对马来亚人民进行了野蛮的迫害和镇压，马来亚民族解放同盟和马来亚各界人民、马来亚民族解放军一起，坚决地和坚持不渝地展开了粉碎“马来西亚”、争取民族独立、民主、和平和祖国统一的斗争。
    贺信说：“南越人民保证，在反对以美帝国主义——我们共同的敌人——为首的帝国主义和殖民主义侵略者、争取民族独立、民主、和平和祖国统一的斗争中，他们将永远站在马来亚人民的一边。”
    泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖中校的贺信中追述了马来亚人民悠久的、光荣的和英勇的历史。贺信指出，马来亚人民的斗争在三十六年前马来亚工人阶级走上政治舞台以后进入了一个新的、深刻的和正确的阶段，这个阶段是由以马来亚共产党为核心的马来亚工人阶级领导的。
    贺信说，马来亚人民的长期斗争不仅仅继续到了现在，而且在深度和广度方面也有了发展。这就证明了这样一个真理，即：在为争取民族解放、反对一开始就占优势的敌人的斗争中，人民必须在革命政党的正确领导下，坚持长期武装斗争，团结全国一切可以团结的力量。只有这样，人民才能站稳脚跟，并取得最后胜利。
    贺信说，泰国和马来亚是近邻。两国人民同命运共呼吸。马来亚人民的斗争也就是泰国人民的斗争。泰国爱国阵线完全支持马来亚民族解放同盟的八项纲领。我们相信，我们两组织和两代表团为我们共同事业的密切合作将稳步发展并永远继续下去。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会的贺信说，亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民坚决支持马来亚人民推翻英帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治、粉碎受到美英帝国主义支持的新殖民主义工具“马来西亚”、争取马来亚的真正独立、自由、民主与和平的正义斗争，并衷心祝愿马来亚人民在反帝爱国的斗争中不断取得新的更大的胜利。
    罗素的贺信说：“争取马来亚真正独立的斗争，需要所有反对英帝国主义所带来的残酷剥削和苦难的人们的真诚的支持。今天统治马来亚的只不过是一个屈从于白宫和英国苏伊士以东的政策的一个傀儡政权，我全力支持马来亚民族解放斗争，并深信，只有经济上和政治上的独立才能解决马来亚人民的问题。民族独立斗争需要我们大家的支持。”
