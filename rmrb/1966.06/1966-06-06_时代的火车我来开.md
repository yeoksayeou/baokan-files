    I Drive the Train of the Times
    Tianjin Railway Bureau worker Jiang Zhengzhong steps onto the driver's cab, a revolutionary tide surging forth. One hand steers the train, the other holds a pen, a long whistle blown, hailing the arrival of the Cultural Revolution! Stepping onto the driver's cab, my heart is filled with class hatred. Hating those monsters and demons being too rampant, releasing sinister winds and poisonous arrows, running at full speed towards the bourgeois "authorities," wanting to crush the heads of monsters and demons. Stepping onto the driver's cab, heading towards the avenue of communism. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun, shining and exposing the tails of class enemies; spurring on the horse and brandishing the whip, accelerating the gallop, crushing all obstacles on the road ahead. Bearing the historical mission on my shoulders, the workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy the cultural stage; holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creating a new era of the Great Cultural Revolution. I drive the train of the times, writing the chapters of revolution!

    时代的火车我来开
    天津机务段工人　姜正忠登上司机驾驶台，革命心潮滚滚来。一手开火车，一手拿笔杆，拉一声长笛，欢呼文化革命的到来！登上司机驾驶台，阶级仇恨满胸怀。恨那牛鬼蛇神太猖狂，放出阴风毒箭来，开足马力冲向资产阶级“权威”，要轧碎牛鬼蛇神的脑袋。登上司机驾驶台，朝着共产主义大道开。毛泽东思想就是红太阳，照得阶级敌人的尾巴露出来；跃马扬鞭加速飞驰，碾平前进道路上的一切障碍。历史的任务肩上担，工农兵要占领文化舞台；高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，开创文化大革命的新时代。时代的火车我来开，革命的篇章写起来！
