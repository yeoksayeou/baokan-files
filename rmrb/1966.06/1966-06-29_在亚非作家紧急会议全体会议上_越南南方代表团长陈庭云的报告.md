	American imperialism is rampant everywhere, placing itself in a position of enmity with all the people of the world, making itself increasingly isolated. The atomic and hydrogen bombs in the hands of American imperialism cannot intimidate those who do not wish to be slaves. The tide of the world's people opposing the American aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the world's people against American imperialism and its lackeys will certainly achieve even greater victories.

	At the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers

	Report by Chen Tingyun, Head of the Delegation from South Vietnam

	June 28, 1966

	New China News Agency

	Chen Tingyun, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, today delivered a report at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. He angrily condemned the bloody crimes of American imperialism in invading South Vietnam and expressed that the South Vietnamese military and people will definitely carry out the sacred struggle against American aggression to the end.

	Chen Tingyun said, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which is the sole legitimate representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, the military and people of South Vietnam have already achieved brilliant victories. He emphasized that American imperialism is not to be feared, and daring to fight it means definitely being able to defeat it.

	Chen Tingyun strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in South Vietnam. He said that since 1965, the armed forces and various struggles of the South Vietnamese people have rapidly developed, and American imperialism can no longer play the role of directing its lackeys from behind the scenes. They have personally rushed to send troops to South Vietnam. The U.S. military has dispatched units from battalions to "the most combat-ready" divisions, swarming into South Vietnam with a menacing attitude. American imperialism has exposed its true form as the most barbaric and brutal aggressor.

	He said that the U.S. troops in South Vietnam are even more barbaric than the Japanese fascist troops and the French expeditionary forces. In every military operation, they carry chemical poisons and gases. They use chemical poisons and gases to force people to leave their homes and build "strategic hamlets" in their occupied areas.

	He said, "American imperialism has exposed itself as a bloodthirsty, ferocious monster. Human history has never seen an invading army like today's U.S. army, which dares to use chemical poisons and gases as ordinary weapons to kill large numbers of people, destroy crops, and spread diseases."

	Chen Tingyun condemned the "peace talks" conspiracy of American imperialism. He said: "Last year, when the U.S. was frequently using chemical poisons and gases in South Vietnam, U.S. President Johnson repeatedly delivered speeches full of hypocritical 'peace talks' rhetoric, announced 'economic aid plans,' and pretended to be innocent of the cruel destruction in South Vietnam. They sent a large number of envoys abroad under the mocking name of 'peace messengers' to hype up Johnson's peace hoax, which aims to divert world opinion from their even more heinous crimes than those of the Hitler group."

	He said, "Practice has proven that Johnson's sweet talk can never deceive us. Through our own bloody experience, we have seen through the wolf's heart and dog's lungs of this imperialist leader. Today, whenever Johnson shouts for peace, whenever his representatives propose some 'new peace plan' at the United Nations, it is as if they are going to send a large number of troops to South Vietnam, launch a larger-scale 'sweep,' pour in more weapons, or spread a new type of chemical poison."

	Chen Tingyun condemned the barbaric and psychological warfare waged by American imperialism in South Vietnam.

	He accused the American bandits of executing a "burn it all, destroy it all, kill it all" barbaric policy everywhere. These murderers, while waging hot war, also vigorously wage psychological warfare. Chen Tingyun said that the American bandits in the areas they occupy are trying to spread the decadent imperialist bourgeois culture to eliminate the people's indomitable will.

	He said: "Currently, a more and more vigorous movement is rising in various cities to resist American cultural influence in all ways. In cities like Saigon and Hue, people and youth have even burned down the American news agency and American libraries."

	Chen Tingyun said that in the face of the barbaric and psychological warfare waged by American imperialism in South Vietnam, South Vietnam faces two paths: "either to surrender to them and accept their rule; or to stand up and fight to the end, prepared to make any sacrifice to defend the survival of the nation. In the past decade, we have been fighting American imperialism in all fields. In the past half year, the South Vietnamese military and people have fought face-to-face with the U.S.'s best divisions and have achieved many brilliant victories."

	He said that during the recent dry season, American imperialism launched more than 70 large-scale "sweeps," which was a period of great trial for the South Vietnamese people. However, the South Vietnamese military and people intercepted all enemy attacks with all the weapons they had, from bamboo spikes, landmines, booby-trapped shoes, grenades, directional mines to various mortars, recoilless guns, and even hornets to kill the enemy. Chen Tingyun said: We fight the enemy with a spirit of decisive battle and victory, and with the invincible tactics of people's war, striking, dividing, and annihilating the enemy.

	He said, "The U.S.'s combat-ready divisions, wherever they go, encounter a brave and always ready-to-annihilate-them opponent. Take the 1st Cavalry Division, the darling of U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, which was once hailed as a new invention in ground warfare concepts, and suffered a fatal blow from the military and people of the Central Highlands."

	He said, "In late March 1966, during the dry season, an armored regiment of the puppet army stationed near Saigon rebelled, surrendered to the people and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and turned their guns on the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys' strongholds. This was a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors, who had hoped to achieve some victories during the dry season to boost the morale of the puppet army and the puppet government."

	Chen Tingyun said, "In the past nine months and up to today, in the cities under enemy control, people from all walks of life have continuously taken to the streets to protest against American imperialism, demanding the overthrow of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam."

	He said, "The people in the enemy-occupied areas are increasingly yearning for the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They clearly understand that to get rid of the oppressed and trampled life, they must stand under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, which is the sole legitimate representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, to fight against American aggression and save the country."

	Chen Tingyun said that after more than five months of fighting during the dry season, the South Vietnamese military and people have killed more than 110,000 enemy troops, including more than 43,000 U.S. soldiers. Today, the liberation armed forces are stronger than ever and are tightening the siege around Saigon. For the U.S. aggressors, there is no safe place in South Vietnam. Our armed forces, with the protection and help of the people, are active even within Saigon, launching attacks on places that the enemy considers inviolable. He said that the practice on the battlefield in South Vietnam has proven that the U.S. army is no longer the "strongest army in the world."

	Chen Tingyun said that in our extremely arduous and glorious struggle against American imperialism, our literary and artistic workers have also contributed their share. We feel very happy and proud to be able to live in an era when our nation has taken on a great mission in history. Our literary and artistic workers follow the main forces directly participating in major battles. We are always producing while fighting, operating in areas close to the enemy, sometimes infiltrating cities to report on the rapidly developing political and military struggles in the enemy's heart. In the enemy-occupied areas, literary and artistic workers, despite the enemy's threats and intimidation, use art to cultivate the people's patriotism and timely arouse the people's anger against the American bandits and the reactionary puppets. The heroic and extraordinary struggle of the 14 million people is an inexhaustible source of creation for our literary and artistic workers. Wherever we go, we can meet heroes and witness heroic deeds.

	Chen Tingyun detailed the outstanding contributions made by Vietnamese literary and artistic workers in the struggle against American aggression and national salvation. He said that today, in our country, all the absurd myths about the so-called power of American imperialism can no longer deceive anyone. The fundamental weaknesses of American imperialism are fully exposed. We thereby more clearly recognize our urgent responsibility, which is to depict through various art forms the various weaknesses of this imperialist colossus with feet of clay.

	Chen Tingyun said that the people of South Vietnam, with their indomitable tradition, are experiencing the most severe test in their national history. Today, the South Vietnamese people are fully utilizing their absolute spiritual superiority and all available forces to fight the enemy and rapidly develop their own strength. The South Vietnamese people have a high level of awareness, and the old and young have all become warriors who directly fight the Americans. No matter how many troops the U.S. increases to 400,000 or 500,000, the South Vietnamese people have every reason to believe that the military and people of South Vietnam will definitely defeat American imperialism on the indomitable land of the South.

	He said that the South Vietnamese people are clear about their arduous historical mission. The South Vietnamese people are determined to fulfill the glorious mission entrusted to them by the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people: to defeat the enemy, American imperialism, which has brought deep suffering and pain to all nations.

	Chen Tingyun said that the brilliant victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam are the victories of the correct line of relying on their own strength formulated by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This fact eloquently proves that even a small and poor nation, as long as it knows how to unite and fight resolutely and has its own correct line, it can completely defeat any imperialist aggressor, even American imperialism.

	He said, we have firm confidence in victory. Because our 17 million dear compatriots in the North are always concerned about our battles and fully support us. American imperialism attempts to permanently divide our country, but it has hit an iron wall. Our entire nation is conducting this sacred struggle with an unshakable determination to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country. The victory of shooting down more than 1,000 U.S. planes in the North is a great encouragement to us in the South. Every achievement in production and combat in the fields, factories, and air defense positions in the North encourages us and strengthens our South Vietnamese people's will to fight against American aggression to the end.

	He said, the 14 million people of South Vietnam deeply love Chairman Ho Chi Minh. Chairman Ho, with all his energy, has led all the Vietnamese people to defeat one imperialist aggressor after another, guiding our nation from the original state of having only spears to today's powerful armed forces that can defeat any imperialist, including American imperialism, at any time.

	Chen Tingyun said that the 14 million people of South Vietnam are willing to contribute all their strength to support the anti-imperialist movements and the struggles for independence, freedom, and democracy in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	Chen Tingyun said: Our anti-American struggle is receiving the concern and support of the entire progressive humanity. The 14 million people of South Vietnam are extremely excited to see that friends and brothers from the five continents are increasingly supporting this anti-American struggle as their own struggle and will forever be grateful to all friends for supporting us and for every word and action condemning American imperialism.

	Chen Tingyun said: The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held in the capital of the great People's Republic of China, Beijing, has made supporting Vietnam in its struggle against American aggression a top priority. On this occasion, we sincerely pay our respects and gratitude to the 650 million brothers of the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong at the helm, have thoroughly supported our struggle against American aggression and national salvation in all aspects.

	Chen Tingyun also said, "We sincerely pay our respects and gratitude to the people of the Soviet Union, who wholeheartedly provide us with all necessary supplies to defeat the American aggressors, the people of the socialist countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all the laboring people and democratic, progressive, and peace-loving forces in the world."

	He said that there has never been such a broad international movement to support Vietnam in its struggle against American imperialism in the world. Even in the United States, the anti-war movement against American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam is expanding in various forms.

	Chen Tingyun finally said, the discussion of supporting Vietnam in its struggle against American aggression at this Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is a precious example of international solidarity and friendship. We once again thank our friends for always paying attention to our struggle against American aggression and national salvation. We are firmly convinced that after this conference, we will all use our sharp weapons—literature—to write more works to more powerfully mobilize the people to fight against American aggression, expose the brutal and beastly face of American imperialism, and all its deceitful and cunning means, and strengthen the brotherly friendship between our peoples.

### 在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上  越南南方代表团长陈庭云的报告

专栏：

      美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。美帝国主义手里的原子弹、氢弹，是吓不倒一切不愿意做奴隶的人们的。全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。
    在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上
    越南南方代表团长陈庭云的报告
    新华社二十八日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线代表团团长陈庭云，今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上作报告，愤怒地谴责美帝国主义侵略越南南方的血腥罪行，表示越南南方军民一定要把神圣的抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    陈庭云说，在以阮友寿为首的南越一千四百万人民的唯一真正代表、越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，越南南方军民已经取得了辉煌的胜利。他强调指出，美帝国主义并没有什么可怕，敢于打它，就一定能够战胜它。
    陈庭云强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南南方犯下的滔天罪行。他说，一九六五年以来，南越人民武装力量和各方面的斗争迅速发展，美帝国主义再也不能照旧扮演在幕后指挥走狗的角色了。他们亲自急急忙忙出兵南越。美国军队派遣从营、旅到“最善战”的师，气势汹汹地涌进越南南方。美帝国主义已经暴露了它是最野蛮、残暴的侵略者的原形。
    他说，到南越的美国军队比日本法西斯军队和法国远征军更加野蛮，他们不论在那一次军事行动中，都要携带化学毒药和毒气。他们用化学毒药和毒气来迫使人民离乡别井，到他们的占领区去建立“战略村”。
    他说，“美帝国主义已经自己暴露了它作为一头嗜血的张牙舞爪的怪兽的面目。人类历史上还没有见到象今天的美国军队这样的敢于用化学毒药和毒气作为普通武器来杀害大量人民、毁坏庄稼、传播疾病的侵略军队。”
    陈庭云谴责了美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋。他说：“去年，正当美国在南越经常使用化学毒药和毒气的时期，美国总统约翰逊不断地宣读了充满虚伪的‘和平谈判’的论调的演说，公布了‘经济援助计划’，装出他们对南越的残酷破坏没有罪过的样子。他们在具有讽刺意义的‘和平使者’的名义下，派遣了大批特使到国外去，为约翰逊旨在转移世界舆论对他们的甚至希特勒集团也无法比拟的滔天罪行的注意的约翰逊和平骗局大吹大擂。”
    他说，“实践已经证明，约翰逊的甜言蜜语永远欺骗不了我们。我们通过自己的血的经验，看透了这个帝国主义头子的狼心狗肺。今天，每当约翰逊叫嚷和平，每当他的代表在联合国提出什么‘新的和平计划’，这就无异于他们要派大量军队到越南南方，展开规模更大的‘扫荡’，投进更多的武器，或者撒放一种新的化学毒药。”
    陈庭云谴责美帝国主义在越南南方进行一场野蛮残杀同心理战争相结合的战争。
    他控诉美国强盗到处都在执行“烧光、毁光、杀光”的野蛮政策。这些杀人强盗在进行热战的同时，还大力进行心理战。陈庭云说，美国强盗在他们占领的地区，竭力传播腐朽的帝国主义资产阶级文化，以便消灭人民坚强不屈的意志。
    他说：“目前各城市正在兴起一个日益蓬勃的以一切方式来反对美国的文化影响的运动。在西贡、顺化等城市的人民和青年，还烧毁了美国的新闻处和美国图书馆。”
    陈庭云说，在美帝国主义对越南南方进行野蛮残杀和心理战相结合的战争面前，使越南南方面临着两条道路：“或者是向他们投降，接受他们的统治；或者是起来战斗到底，准备作出不惜一切代价的牺牲，以保卫民族的生存。在过去十多年中，我们在一切领域中同美帝国主义持续作战。近半年多来，南越军民已经同美国最善战的师进行面对面的战斗，并且取得了多次辉煌的胜利。”
    他说，在最近的旱季中，美帝国主义展开了七十多次大规模的“扫荡”，这是对南越人民大考验的时期。但是南越军民以手中现有的一切武器截击美国军队的一切进攻。从尖桩、地雷、脚踩地雷、手榴弹、定向地雷到各种迫击炮、无后座力大炮等各种武器，甚至还用马蜂来杀敌。陈庭云说：我们以决战决胜的精神以及人民战争富有创造性的无敌的战术，打击敌人，分割敌人，歼灭敌人。
    他说，“美国的善战的师团无论走到那里，都遇到一个勇敢而且随时准备把他们消灭的对手。拿美国国防部长麦克纳马拉的宠儿第一空降骑兵师来说，这个曾经被大肆宣扬为地面战争观念中的一个新发明的师团，遭到了中部中区军民的致命打击。”
    他说：“在旱季一九六六年的三月底，驻在西贡附近的伪军的一个装甲团举行起义，向人民和越南南方民族解放阵线投诚，并且掉转枪口向美国侵略者及其走狗的据点发动进攻。这对于在旱季中企图取得一点胜利以此来提高伪军和傀儡政权的士气的美国侵略者来说，是一次惨重的失败。”
    陈庭云说，“从过去九个月并且一直到今天，在敌人控制的各个城市里，各阶层人民纷纷起来，连续不断地上街示威谴责美帝国主义，要求推翻阮文绍—阮高其集团，要求美国把军队从越南南方撤出去。”
    他说，“敌占区的人民越来越向往越南南方民族解放阵线，他们清楚地认识到要想摆脱被压迫和被蹂躏的生活，就得站到一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正代表——越南南方民族解放阵线抗美救国的旗帜下。”
    陈庭云说，越南南方军民在旱季中经过五个多月的战斗，共计消灭敌人十一万多，其中美军四万三千多名。今天解放武装力量比任何时候都更强大，现在正在缩紧对西贡这个城市的包围圈。我们越南南方的土地，对于美国侵略者说来，没有一块土地是他们安全的地方。我们武装力量在人民的掩护和帮助下，就在西贡市内活动，向敌人认为不可侵犯的地方发动攻击。他说，越南南方战场上的实践已经证明，美国军队不再是“世界上最强大的军队。”
    陈庭云说，在我们越南南方人民所进行的极其艰巨和光荣的反对美帝国主义的抗战事业中，我们文艺工作者也贡献了自己的一份力量，我们感到十分幸福和自豪，因为我们能够生活在我们的民族在历史面前担负了重大的使命的时代。我们文艺工作者跟随各主力兵团直接参加各个大的战役，我们时时刻刻都在一边生产一边战斗，靠近敌人的一些区域活动，有时潜入城市就地采访在敌人心脏正在迅速发展的政治与军事斗争。在敌占区的文艺工作者不顾敌人的威胁、恐吓，用文艺的形式培养人民的爱国热忱，及时激发人民对美国强盗和反动的傀儡的愤怒。一千四百万人民正在进行的英勇卓绝的战斗生活，是我们文艺工作者取之不尽的创作源泉。我们无论走到那里，都能遇到英雄人物，亲眼看到英雄的事迹。
    陈庭云详细介绍了越南文学艺术工作者在抗美救国斗争中所做出的卓越贡献。他说，今天，在我国，一切关于美帝国主义的所谓可怕力量的荒唐神话，再也不能欺骗任何人了。美帝国主义的一切根本弱点正在充分地暴露出来。我们由此更加认识到自己的迫切责任，这就是通过各种艺术形式，描绘这个帝国主义泥足巨人各方面的虚弱。
    陈庭云说，具有坚强不屈传统的越南南方人民，正在经历着自己民族历史上最严峻的考验。今天，南方人民充分发挥自己精神上的绝对优势，利用一切可以利用的力量来杀敌，并且在战火中迅速地发展自己的力量。南方人民已有高度的觉悟，无论老幼都成了拿起武器直接杀美国佬的战士。不管美帝国主义增兵到四十万或者五十万，越南南方人民完全有理由肯定：越南南方军民一定能够在坚强不屈的南方的土地上打败美帝国主义。
    他说，南方人民是清楚地懂得自己艰巨的历史任务的。南方人民决心完成亚洲和非洲人民以及所有爱好和平人民交给的光荣任务：打败给各民族带来深重灾难和痛苦的敌人美帝国主义。
    陈庭云说，越南南方军民取得的辉煌胜利，是越南南方民族解放阵线所制定的依靠本身力量的正确路线的胜利。这个事实雄辩地证明，即使是弱小、穷困的民族，只要善于团结起来坚决斗争，并且有了自己的正确路线，那么，它就完全有可能打败任何帝国主义侵略者，即使是美帝国主义。
    他说，我们对胜利抱有坚定的信心。因为我们北方一千七百万亲爱的同胞，无时无刻不在关注着我们的战斗，并全力地支持我们。美帝国主义企图永远分割我们的国家，但是，它却一头撞到铜墙铁壁上。我们全国人民正在怀着解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的不可动摇的决心，进行这场神圣的抗战。北方击落一千多架美国飞机的胜利，对我们南方是一个极大的鼓舞。北方在田间、工厂和防空阵地上取得的每一个生产和战斗成绩，都鼓舞着我们，加强了我们南方人民抗美到底的战斗意志。
    他说，南方一千四百万人民十分爱戴胡志明主席。胡主席以全部精力领导全体越南人民打败了一个又一个的帝国主义侵略者，引导我们民族从原来只有长矛的状况发展到今天拥有随时打败包括美帝国主义在内的任何帝国主义的凶恶军队的强大武装力量。
    陈庭云说，一千四百万越南南方人民愿以自己的全部力量支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切反帝运动和为独立、自由、民主而作的斗争。
    陈庭云说：我们的反美抗战正在受到整个进步人类的关心和支持。一千四百万越南南方人民，由于看到五大洲日益广大的朋友和兄弟把这个反美抗战看作他们自己的斗争而感到无比兴奋，并将世世代代感谢各位朋友支持我们，感谢你们对美帝国主义严厉谴责的每一言语和每一行动。
    陈庭云说：在伟大的中华人民共和国首都北京召开的这次亚非作家紧急会议，把支持越南反对美国侵略作为一个首要的问题，值此机会，我们谨向在敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下，在一切方面都彻底支持我们抗美救国抗战的六亿五千万兄弟的中国人民，致以真诚的敬意和感谢。
    陈庭云又说，“我们谨向为打败美国侵略者而全心全意地向我们提供一切必需品的苏联人民、社会主义各国、亚非拉各国和全世界劳动人民及民主、进步、和平力量，表示敬意和真诚感谢。”
    他说，在世界上从未出现过象这次这样广泛的支持越南反对美帝国主义的国际运动。甚至就连美国，反对美帝国主义在越南进行侵略战争的反战运动也正在以种种形式扩大。
    陈庭云最后说，我们今天举行的讨论支援越南抗美问题的亚非作家紧急会议，是珍贵的国际团结友谊的有力例证。我们再一次感谢朋友们时时刻刻关注我国抗美救国的抗战。我们坚信，这次会议之后，我们大家用自己的锐利武器——文学，写出更多的作品，以便更有力地推动人民起来进行反美战斗，揭穿美帝国主义的残暴的和野兽面目，以及美帝国主义的一切欺骗、狡猾的手段，增强我们各国人民之间的兄弟友谊。
