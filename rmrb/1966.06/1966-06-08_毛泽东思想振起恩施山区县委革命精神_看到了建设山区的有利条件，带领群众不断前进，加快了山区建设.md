    Editor's Note: In the past two years, the pace of construction in the Enshi mountainous area has accelerated. This is the result of putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, emphasizing politics, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee leadership. The cadres in the Enshi mountainous area use the "two-point theory" to view the mountainous area, the developmental perspective to view the mountainous area, and proletarian feelings to treat the people of the mountainous area. In this way, they see the most valuable thing about the people of the mountainous area – their enthusiasm for building a socialist mountainous area. Because they see this point, it is possible to get rid of blind complacency, arouse revolutionary spirit, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous area to form a huge force to transform the world.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the production level and the people's living standards in the mountainous areas have been greatly improved. However, due to historical reasons, the vast mountainous areas are still relatively backward in many aspects. Fundamentally changing the face of the mountainous areas requires arduous labor. Planting the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the high mountains and building new socialist mountainous areas together with the people of the mountainous areas is the glorious task of comrades working in the mountainous areas.

    Our country is a country with many mountains. Many mountainous areas were once our revolutionary base areas. The vast mountainous areas are strategic areas for building socialism. The mountainous areas have hardworking and intelligent people and contain extremely rich resources. Accelerating the construction of mountainous areas is a major issue that needs to be placed on the agenda of leadership departments at all levels.

    To build the mountainous areas, leading cadres must go to the masses of the people in the mountainous areas to personally participate in practice. Only in practice can we specifically know what work needs to be done in the mountainous areas, and only then can we truly grasp the objective laws of transforming the mountainous areas.

    "Is it standing on the top of the mountain and looking ahead, seeing farther, or lying in a mountain depression, sitting in a well and looking at the sky, and being satisfied with the achievements already made?" This is a sharp question posed to themselves by many county party committee comrades in the Enshi mountainous area during the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee leadership.

    Standing High, We Should See Farther

    The western part of the rich Jianghan Plain is the high mountainous area of the Dabashan Mountains extending into Hubei Province – the Enshi Special Zone. Here, the mountains are high, the valleys are wide, and the resources are abundant. It is a uniquely endowed mountainous area. However, due to the cruel class oppression before liberation, even such superior "heaven" and "earth" could not benefit the people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, production here has developed to a great extent. Taking grain as an example, the total output of the region in 1965 reached 1.4 billion jin, an increase of 55.5 percent compared with the 900 million jin in the early days of liberation. Highway construction has developed from less than 400 kilometers at the time of liberation to more than 2,000 kilometers. The people's lives have improved, and the contribution to the country has increased year by year. It should be said that the achievements are great.

    In the past, when some comrades mentioned the mountainous areas, they always felt that the mountainous areas were not as good as the plains. They loved the plains and did not love the high mountains. They always said "poor mountain ravines" and "not much future." They emphasized the poor conditions in the mountainous areas and believed that the construction of the mountainous areas should be later than the plains. Therefore, as long as production increased a little every year, they felt at ease. The socialist education movement that began in 1964 broke the tranquility of this deep mountain valley like spring thunder. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants raised sharp questions to the county party committee leadership: Why are we still living off the little paddy fields and terraces left by our grandfathers, and how can we still rely on destroying forests to reclaim land for "eating"? They said that this was "eating the ancestors' rice and smashing the descendants' pot." The leadership lagging behind the masses shook the complacency of many county party committee comrades.

    "Starting a business or maintaining a business?" "With such good mountains, good water, and good people, why is the face of the place not changing quickly?" One question after another arose in the minds of many comrades. The comrades of the JianShi County Party Committee said: "The mountains have not changed, the water has not changed, and the main reason is that the county party committee leadership's thinking has not changed." The comrades of the Lichuan County Party Committee said: "Lichuan County has an altitude of 1,200 meters. Standing high should allow us to see far, but we are blocked by the surrounding mountains of 1,700 to 1,800 meters, and we only look at our own heels behind closed doors!" They felt deeply ashamed that they had not led the masses to make greater achievements for a long time in such a place with good mountains and good water.

    The criticism from the masses and the self-criticism of the county party committee comrades promoted the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee leadership. They broke the complacency and seemed to jump from a narrow basin to a high mountain, and their vision suddenly opened up. The mountainous area does have its unfavorable aspects: the mountains are steep and the rocks are hard, the wells are large and the gullies are deep, the transportation is blocked, and the residences are scattered, etc. However, this is only one aspect of things. The mountainous area also has its extremely favorable aspects: the mountains are high and the forests are dense, and the world-rare and precious tree species - metasequoia is produced here; tung, tea, lacquer, palm and medicinal materials can be planted everywhere; there are grasslands here, which is a good place to develop draught animals; there are abundant mineral deposits here waiting for people to develop. In a word, what the mountains have is not available in the plains, and what the plains have can also be found in the mountains. Taking grain as an example, as long as terraced fields are built and as long as improved varieties and advanced cultivation techniques are promoted, the yield can be doubled. Some comrades said: The mountains are treasure mountains, and the land is treasure land. From a developmental perspective, we should love the mountains more and work hard to build the mountainous areas. Thinking guides action, and the pace of progress in the counties of the Enshi mountainous area has accelerated since then.

    An Important Issue of Understanding

    Of course, the already accelerated pace is still inconsistent. Some counties are faster, and some places are slower. The dividing line between fast and slow mainly depends on the degree of revolutionization of a county party committee and on whether they have a correct view of the people in the mountainous area. Today, some people still say: The requirements of the people in the mountainous area are not high. In the past, they were satisfied with "corn plus hezha" (corn is corn, hezha is a kind of food made from soybeans), and today they are already satisfied with "corn plus bacon." The implication is that the people in the mountainous area have always been content, and "the content are always happy." How should we understand and view this statement?

    Indeed, living in such a mountainous place, how to correctly view the people in the mountainous area is the primary issue for the leading comrades of the county party committee. Many comrades grew up in the Enshi mountainous area, and many comrades have lived here for a long time. They all admit that the mountains here are rich, but some people are always a little unmotivated to change the face of the mountainous area. Why? Because they do not see the great socialist enthusiasm hidden among the people in the mountainous area.

    The deeds of the Red Flag of Enshi Mountainous Area - Quankou Commune in Badong County, changing its face in a few years, can embolden and encourage the people in the mountainous area. This commune has 362 households, living in two large mountains separated by deep gullies. Some people say that the steep terrain here is "the wind blows the stones down the river, and the crow's foot loses soil." People describe the thin soil layer as "three days of sun drying the seedlings to death, and a sudden rain reveals the rock shell." Of the 4,500 mu of land, only 500 mu can be cultivated with cattle. In the past, the state had to supply grain every year. In 1960, under the leadership of the commune party committee, the people here worked hard and vigorously carried out farmland construction, and achieved self-sufficiency in grain that year. Now, every team has a surplus of grain, tea and tung trees grow into forests, and pigs and sheep fill the pens. Last year, the income from economic crops alone reached 88 yuan per household, and 90 percent of the poor and lower-middle peasants lived in tile-roofed houses.

    How did these changes come about? It is because the ideological revolutionization of the cadres has mobilized the socialist enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous area. Huang Xingchang, the leader of the Tiger Cage Production Team, broke his spine on a steep hillside. A class enemy gloated and said: "What are you doing to change the world? See if you can still handle it?" Huang Xingchang was carried home, and immediately convened a team committee in front of his bed, and said excitedly: "We must fight for this breath, and we must turn this bald mountain into a gold and silver nest." When he was a little better, he went to the slope with crutches to direct production. This hard-boned captain is the representative of the Quankou people. Quankou is just an epitome of the construction of the Enshi mountainous area. There are many communes and teams in the whole special zone that are changing or are changing the face of the mountainous area like Quankou. The deeds of Quankou vividly illustrate that the mountainous area can be quickly changed, and the decisive factor in changing the world is people, the hardworking and intelligent people in the mountainous area.

    Today, the production level in the Enshi mountainous area is still relatively low. Last year, although the grain yield per unit area more than doubled compared with the early days of liberation, it was only about 300 jin; there are a large number of places suitable for forestry and animal husbandry waiting to be developed; the people's clothing and cultural life, etc., need to be further improved. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change." Change is the inevitable law of the development of things; the desire for change is the revolutionary demand of the masses of the people. Saying that the people in the mountainous area are already satisfied with "corn plus bacon" is not the constantly revolutionary view of the Marxists, and it is obviously a statement lacking class feeling. The reason why this statement is very harmful is that it binds the thinking of some comrades and makes them lack the fearless enterprising spirit of revolutionaries. We must see that the urgent desire of the people in the mountainous area to change their backwardness is the most essential and most valuable thing about the people in the mountainous area.

    The Power of Ideological Revolutionization of Leadership

    After we visited Enshi, Jianshi, Lichuan and other counties, we deeply felt the power of the ideological revolutionization of the county party committee leadership. Last year, on the basis of the self-revolution of the Jianshi County Party Committee, the whole county carried out a socialist education movement in areas with half of the population. Here, we heard the sound of opening mountains and blasting rocks coming from all directions, and everywhere was a thriving scene of basic farmland construction. Since last winter, the Wuxing Brigade of the Luojia Commune in this county has newly built hundreds of acres of stone-filled terraced fields; the Taoyuan Brigade of the Luoshui Commune has built a small reservoir dam and a four-kilometer-long mountain channel. Things that have not been done for many years have been accomplished in just a few months. "Why is the enthusiasm of the masses so high, and why is the pace of progress so steady?" A commune member of the Taoyuan Brigade replied: "We are doing it to build socialism; of course, it is also because someone is leading us to do it, and we are doing it with a clear goal."

    Who is leading them to do it? It is the cadres at all levels of JianShi County who have undergone revolutionary education. Comrade Jiang Qishou, Secretary of the MaoPing District Party Committee, said: "In the past, we mostly urged cultivation and sowing, running around here and there, talking a lot, and giving little concrete guidance, and the effect was not great." This was representative in the past. Now, the vast majority of cadres at all levels in JianShi County have gone to the countryside to stay at points. Wherever we go, we see the secretaries of the county party committee, district party committee, or commune party committee all at their "points," with only one or two comrades left at home on duty.

    The masses generally reflected that the comrades who came down to stay at points have a more solid style than before. Wherever we went, we saw them seriously studying Chairman Mao's works, discussing the relationship between politics and production, in order to unify their understanding, highlight politics, promote ideological revolutionization, and drive the current production. In Lichuan and JianShi, we talked with the cadres of several production teams, and they all actively talked about the benefits they tasted from studying Chairman Mao's works, vividly illustrating the tremendous spiritual power generated by Chairman Mao's works among the masses.

    The revolutionization of leadership thinking is also reflected in the fact that leading cadres at all levels go deep into the masses to grasp key issues. The leading comrades of the Enshi Prefectural Party Committee and some county party committees, in order to solve the difficulty of clothing for the people in the mountainous area, personally planted experimental fields, proving that cotton can be planted in low mountains and Ergaoshan (mountains of 800 to 1,200 meters), and can achieve high yields. Because they "plant cotton with class feelings," and because individual guidance is more than general appeals, the total cotton output of the entire special zone last year reached more than 10,000 dan. This is unprecedented in history.

    Comrade Dong Chang, Secretary of the JianShi County Party Committee, said well: "Good mountains, good water, and good people, and also a good leadership." From this sentence, we see a huge force from the bottom of the hearts of the county party committee comrades in the Enshi mountainous area. With this force, they will surely be able to stride forward, climb the dangerous peaks, and look to the future, which is an infinitely beautiful future for the mountainous area...

### 毛泽东思想振起恩施山区县委革命精神  看到了建设山区的有利条件，带领群众不断前进，加快了山区建设

    毛泽东思想振起恩施山区县委革命精神
    看到了建设山区的有利条件，带领群众不断前进，加快了山区建设
    编者按：近两年来，恩施山区建设的步伐加快了。这是毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，促进县委领导思想革命化的结果。恩施山区的干部用“两分法”看山区，用发展的观点看山区，用无产阶级的感情对待山区人民，这样，他们就看到了山区人民最宝贵的东西——建设社会主义山区的积极性。正因为他们看到了这一点，才有可能摆脱盲目的自满思想，振起革命精神，把山区人民的积极性充分调动起来，形成一股改天换地的巨大力量。
    解放以来，在党的领导下，山区的生产水平和人民的生活水平，有了很大程度的提高。但是，由于历史的原因，广大山区在很多方面仍然是比较落后的。从根本上改变山区的面貌，还需要付出艰巨的劳动。把毛泽东思想红旗插上高山，同山区人民一起，建设社会主义的新山区，这是在山区工作同志们的光荣任务。
    我国是个多山的国家。许多山区，曾经是我们的革命根据地。广大山区，是建设社会主义的战略要地。山区有着勤劳、智慧的人民，蕴藏着极其丰富的资源。加快山区的建设，是需要提到各级领导部门议事日程上的大事。
    要建设山区，领导干部就要到山区人民群众中去亲身参加实践。只有在实践中，才能具体地知道山区要做什么工作，才能真正掌握改造山区的客观规律。
    “是站在高山顶峰朝前看，看得更远，还是躺在山窝里，坐井观天，满足于已经取得的成绩？”这是在县委领导思想革命化中，恩施山区许多县委同志向自己提出的一个尖锐问题。
    站得高，就该看得更远
    富饶的江汉平原西部，是大巴山东延伸入湖北境内的高山地带——恩施专区。这里群山高耸，河谷宽展，资源丰富，是个得天独厚的山区。但是，由于解放前残酷的阶级压迫，即使这样优越的“天”和“地”，也无力造福于人民。解放后，在党的领导下，这里的生产有了很大程度的发展。以粮食来说，一九六五年全区总产量达到十四亿斤，比解放初期的九亿斤增加了百分之五十五点五。公路建设从解放时的不足四百公里，发展到二千多公里。人民的生活提高了，对国家贡献逐年增加。应当说，成绩是很大的。
    过去，有些同志一提起山区来，总觉得山区不如平原。他们爱平川不爱高山，一说就是“穷山沟”“前途不大”；他们强调山区条件差，建设山区就是应当比平原地区迟一些，因此只要生产年年有点增长，也就心安理得了。一九六四年开始的社会主义教育运动，象春雷一般打破了这深山幽谷里的安宁。广大的贫农下中农对县委领导提出了尖锐的问题：为什么我们还凭老爷爷留下的一点水田梯地过日子，怎能还靠毁林开荒“吃饭”呢？他们说，这是“吃了祖宗饭，砸了子孙锅”。领导落后于群众，震动了许多县委同志安于现状的思想。
    “创业，还是守业？”“好山好水好群众，为什么面貌改变不快？”问题一个又一个的在许多同志的脑子里起伏。建始县委的同志说：“山没变，水没变，主要是县委领导思想没有变。”利川县委的同志说：“利川县城海拔一千二百米，站得高本该看得远，可是，我们被周围一千七八百米的高山挡住了视线，关起门来只看自己的脚后跟！”他们为自己在这样好山好水的地方，长期以来没有领导好群众做出更大的成绩而深深抱愧。
    群众的批评和县委同志的自我批评，推动了县委领导思想革命化。他们打破了安于现状的思想，好象从狭小的盆地跳上高山，眼光豁然开朗。山区，确实有它不利的方面：山陡岩硬，阱大沟深，交通闭塞，居住分散，等等。但是，这仅仅是事物的一个方面。山区，还有它极其有利的方面：山高林密，世界稀有名贵树种——水杉出产在这里；桐、茶、漆、棕和药材，到处可以栽种；这里有草场，是发展耕畜的好地方；这里有丰富的矿藏，等待人们去开发。一句话，山之所有，是平川没有的，而平川所有，山里也可以有。以粮食来说，只要修了梯田梯地，只要推广优良品种和先进耕作技术，产量就可能成倍增长。有些同志说：山是宝山，地是宝地，从发展的眼光来看，我们更要爱山，要鼓起劲头来建设山区。思想指导行动，恩施山区各县前进的步伐从此加快了。
    一个重要的认识问题
    当然，已经加快的步伐还是不一致的。有的县快些，有的地方慢些。而快慢的分界线，主要决定于一个县委革命化的程度，决定于他们对山区人民有没有正确的看法。今天，仍然有人说：山区人民的要求不高，过去他们满足于“包谷加合渣”（包谷就是玉米，合渣是黄豆做的一种食物），今天已经满足于“包谷加腊肉”了。意思是说，山区人民从来是知足的，而“知足者常乐”。怎样理解和看待这种说法呢？
    的确，生活在这样一个多山的地方，如何正确地看待山区人民，对县委领导同志来说是首要的问题。许多同志在恩施山区土生土长，不少同志也在这里住久了，他们也都承认这里的山是富饶的，但是有些人对改变山区的面貌总是有点劲头不足。为什么？因为看不到山区人民中间蕴藏着极大的社会主义积极性。
    恩施山区的红旗——巴东县泉口公社，几年之间改变面貌的事迹，可以使山区人民壮胆量，长志气。这个公社三百六十二户，分居在两架被深沟隔开的大山上。有人说，这里陡峭的地形是“风吹石头滚下河，老鸦歇脚土就梭”；人们形容土层薄，说是“三天太阳晒死苗，一场急雨现岩壳。”四千五百亩土地，只有五百来亩可以用牛耕地。过去，年年要国家供应粮食。一九六○年，在公社党委领导下，这里的人民奋发图强，大搞农田建设，当年就做到粮食自给。现在，队队粮食有余，茶桐成林，猪羊满圈。去年，每户仅经济作物的收入就达到八十八元，百分之九十的贫农下中农住上了瓦房。
    这些变化怎样来的？是由于干部的思想革命化，调动了山区人民的社会主义积极性。老虎笼生产队队长黄兴昌，在陡峭的山坡上跌断了脊梁骨，有个阶级异己分子幸灾乐祸地说：“搞什么改天换地，看你还过得硬？”黄兴昌被人抬到家里，立即在床前召开队委会，激动地说：“这口气一定要争，说什么也要把这秃山头变成金银窝。”他稍好一些，就拄着拐棍上坡指挥生产。这个硬骨头队长就是泉口人民的代表。泉口，只不过是建设恩施山区的一个缩影，全专区还有许许多多社、队同泉口一样，改变了或正在改变着山区的面貌。泉口的事迹生动地说明：山区是能够迅速改变面貌的，而改天换地决定的因素是人，是山区勤劳、智慧的人民。
    今天，恩施山区的生产水平还是比较低的。去年，粮食单位面积产量虽然超过了解放初期的一倍，也还只有三百斤左右；这里有大量的宜林宜牧的地方等待开发；人民的穿着和文化生活等方面，还有待进一步改善。毛泽东同志说：“穷则思变”。变，这是事物发展的必然规律；要变，这是人民群众的革命要求。说山区人民已经满足于“包谷加腊肉”了，这不是马克思主义者不断革命的观点，也显然是缺乏阶级感情的说法。这种说法之所以十分有害，是因为它束缚着一些同志的思想，使他们缺乏革命者的那种大无畏的进取精神。我们必须看到山区人民改变落后面貌的迫切愿望，就是山区人民最本质的东西，最可宝贵的东西。
    领导思想革命化的威力
    在我们访问了恩施、建始、利川等县之后，深深感到县委领导思想革命化的威力。去年，在建始县委进行自我革命的基础上，全县在一半人口的地区进行了社会主义教育运动。在这里，我们听到开山炸石的声响从四面八方传来，到处是农田基本建设的兴旺景象。这个县的罗家公社五星大队去冬以来，新建了成百亩的石坎梯田；落水公社桃园大队建成了一座小型蓄水坝和四公里长的依山渠道。多少年代没有办的事，在短短的几个月里就办成了。“群众的劲头为什么这么足，前进的步子为什么这么稳？”桃园大队有个社员回答说：“我们干，是为了建设社会主义；当然，也是因为有人领着我们干，干得有个准头。”
    谁领着他们干？是经过革命化教育的建始县各级干部。猫坪区委书记江其寿同志说：“过去，我们多半是催耕催种，这里跑那里转，说得多，具体指导少，效果不大。”这在以往是有代表性的。现在，建始县各级干部绝大部分都下乡蹲点去了。我们来到县委、区委或者是公社党委，书记都在自己的“点”上，只有个把同志留在家里值班。
    群众普遍反映，下来蹲点的同志，作风比以往扎实了。我们所到之处，都看到他们在认真学习毛主席著作，讨论政治和生产的关系，以便统一认识，突出政治，促进思想革命化，带动当前的生产。在利川和建始，我们同几个生产队的干部交谈，他们都主动地谈起学习毛主席著作尝到的甜头，生动地说明了毛主席著作在群众中所产生的巨大精神力量。
    领导思想的革命化，还表现在各级领导干部深入群众抓关键问题。恩施地委和一些县委的领导同志，为了解决山区人民穿衣的困难，亲自种试验田，证明低山、二高山（八百米至一千二百米的山）都可以种棉花，而且能够高产。由于他们是“带着阶级感情去种棉花”，由于个别指导多于一般号召，全专区去年棉花总产量，达一万担以上。这是历史上从未有过的。
                        ×　×　×
    建始县委书记董昌同志说得好：“好山好水好群众，还要有个好领导。”从这句话里，我们看到了恩施山区县委同志们发自内心的一股巨大力量。有了这股力量，他们就一定可以阔步向前，攀上险峰，极目望去，那是山区无限美好的未来……。
