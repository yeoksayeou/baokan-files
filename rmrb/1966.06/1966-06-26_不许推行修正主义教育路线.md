    The Kuang Yaming gang used the guise of part-work, part-study to engage in anti-Party, anti-socialist activities. What he implemented was not a proletarian education line, but a thoroughly feudal and capitalist education line.

    Part-work, part-study and part-farming, part-study are correct paths pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and are the inevitable result of the in-depth development of the socialist revolution. However, the anti-Party, anti-socialist, counter-revolutionary element Kuang Yaming openly opposed Chairman Mao's educational thought. Let us tear off his mask and see what kind of goods he is peddling.

    When proposing to establish the Liyang Branch School, Kuang Yaming said: "The academies of feudal society were very good. They read a lot of books, including literature, history, philosophy, the Four Books and Five Classics – everything, that was all-round development." He also said: "Academies are very good. Each person has a table, and the teacher sits beside them. They can ask questions when they have problems. The current (referring to full-time schools) are simply not good. We have classes here and there. We must establish a school like an academy (referring to the branch school)." Therefore, he spared no expense in meticulously planning a library with 700,000 books, and loudly proclaimed that the library would collect all materials from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, and told everyone to study desperately and bury themselves in books. He said more than once: "Our place has peach blossoms and green willows, it is a good place for studying."

    Kuang Yaming established the Liyang Branch School not to implement the Party's education policy, not to implement part-work, part-study and part-farming, part-study, but to use it as a means to peddle feudal and capitalist black goods, subtly poisoning the youth, in order to achieve the evil goal of "peaceful evolution."

    The Kuang Yaming gang also talked about implementing part-work, part-study to reduce the three major differences on the surface, but this was a deception. What they were doing was completely expanding the three major differences. Let's take capital construction as an example!

    First, Kuang Yaming personally designed five toilets, which were very beautiful and cost a lot of money, wasting resources, which caused great dissatisfaction among the peasants.

    Second, he also planned to build a building in Team One as a classroom.

    Third, until now, only nearly one hundred square meters of "rammed earth" have been built, which cost more money than a brick and wood structure house. Kuang Yaming and his gang, on the one hand, asked for credit from higher authorities, and on the other hand, decorated the "rammed earth" very beautifully. The trick he played was really killing two birds with one stone, gaining both fame and profit.

    Fourth, Kuang Yaming said: "You teachers can design your own housing. Build whatever you like." Therefore, the family dormitories were built in strange shapes, which not only cost a lot of money, but also were divorced from the masses.

    You see! Isn't Kuang Yaming using the guise of part-work, part-study to achieve the goal of expanding the three major differences and restoring capitalism?

    The ambitious, Kuang Yaming, the individual careerist who was trying to gain anti-Party capital, paid special attention to running small newspapers from the beginning of the construction of the branch school, and he determined everything from content to form. He personally read every issue of the small newspaper, and severely criticized it if he was even slightly dissatisfied.

    Kuang Yaming paid special attention to preserving the small newspapers. He said: "You must give me a copy of the 'Study Bulletin' and 'Labor and Study'. I must have a complete set, which will be impossible to buy in the future."

    Kuang Yaming wanted to use the small newspapers to completely record his "achievements" and deceive the trust of the Party and the people.

    For the same purpose, Kuang Yaming also particularly liked taking photos as souvenirs. He never participated in labor to build the school, but he often wandered around the construction site, grabbing a few students to take a photo with him here; walking there, he grabbed a few more students to take a photo as a souvenir.

    At the same time as preparing to build the branch school, he began to prepare for the school history exhibition, because in the future school history exhibition, he would of course be a famous figure.

    Obviously, Kuang Yaming's "enthusiasm" for part-work, part-study and part-farming, part-study was definitely not to carry out educational revolution, but to gain anti-Party and anti-socialist political capital.

    不许推行修正主义教育路线
    匡亚明黑帮借半工半读之名，行反党反社会主义之实。他所贯彻执行的不是无产阶级教育路线，而是彻头彻尾的封建主义、资本主义的教育路线。
    半工半读、半农半读是党中央和毛主席所指出的一条正确的道路，是社会主义革命深入发展的必然结果。但是反党反社会主义反革命分子匡亚明公然同毛主席的教育思想相对抗。我们撕破他的画皮，看看他贩卖些什么货色。
    在提出办溧阳分校时，匡亚明说：“封建社会的书院是很好的，读的书很多，文学、历史、哲学、四书五经，样样读，那才是全面发展。”又说：“书院很好，一个人一张桌子，老师坐在旁边，有什么问题就问，很好。现在（指全日制学校）根本不行，这节课在这里上，那节课在那里上，我们要办个书院式的学校（指分校）。”因此，他不惜一切代价，精心筹划一个有七十万册书的图书馆，大肆扬言图书馆里收藏古今中外的一切资料，并叫大家拚命读书，钻到书堆里去。他不止一次地说：“我们这里桃红柳绿，是读书的好地方。”
    匡亚明办溧阳分校，不是为了贯彻党的教育方针，不是为了实行半工半读、半农半读，而是想借此来兜售封建主义、资本主义的黑货，潜移默化地毒害青年，以达到“和平演变”的罪恶目的。
    匡亚明黑帮表面也讲实行半工半读是为了缩小三大差别，但这是骗人的。他们搞的一套完全是扩大三大差别。就以基本建设为例吧！
    一，匡亚明亲自设计了五个厕所，搞的非常漂亮，花了很多钱，铺张浪费，农民表示很大不满。
    二，他还准备在一队造一幢楼房作教室。
    三，直到现在仅搞了近一百平方米的“干打垒”，花的钱比砖木结构的房子还多。匡亚明一伙一面向上级请功，一面把“干打垒”装饰得非常漂亮。他耍的这个花招，真是一箭双雕，名利双收。
    四，匡亚明说：“你们教师的住房自己设计，喜欢什么样的就搞什么样的。”因此，家属宿舍修得奇形怪状，不但花钱多，而且脱离群众。
    你们看！匡亚明不是在打着半工半读的幌子，达到扩大三大差别，复辟资本主义的目的吗？
    野心勃勃，捞取反党资本的个人野心家匡亚明，从筹建分校开始，就特别注意办小报，从内容到形式都是他一手规定的。每一期小报，他都亲自看，稍微有一点不满意，便狠狠地批评一通。
    匡亚明特别注意保存小报。他说：“《学习简报》和《劳动和学习》，你们都要给我一份，我得有完整的一套，将来买也买不到。”
    匡亚明想用小报完整地记下他的“功劳”，骗取党和人民的信任。
    为着同一个目的，匡亚明还特别喜欢摄影留念。他自己从不参加劳动建校，但经常到工地上转来转去，走到那里，拉住几个同学合拍一张照片；走到这里，又拉住几个同学合拍一张留影。
    在筹建分校的同时，他就着手准备校史展览，因为在将来的校史展览中，他当然是赫赫有名的人物。
    显然，匡亚明“热心”于半工半读、半农半读，决不是搞教育革命，而是为了捞取反党反社会主义的政治资本。
