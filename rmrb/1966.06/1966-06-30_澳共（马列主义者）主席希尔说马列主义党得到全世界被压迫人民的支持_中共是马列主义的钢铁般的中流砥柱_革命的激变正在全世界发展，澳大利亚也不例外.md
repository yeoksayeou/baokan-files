	Moscow, June 29 (New China News Agency) — A message from Melbourne: In a speech, Chairman Hill of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists) emphasized that, contrary to the slanders of the revisionists, parties that adhere to Marxism-Leninism are not isolated. Today, "the powerful Communist Party of China has become the iron pillar of Marxism-Leninism. There are now powerful Marxist-Leninist forces," which "have gained the genuine respect and support of the oppressed peoples of the world."

	The 20th issue of the *Australian Communist*, published on May 31, carried Hill's speech delivered in April at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of New Zealand.

	In his speech, Hill praised the New Zealand Communist Party, saying, "It is an inspiration to all Marxist-Leninists. It is becoming stronger and stronger." He added, "In the vast sea of revisionism, the New Zealand Communist Party, led by Comrade Wilcock, stands firm under the eternal radiance of the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong." The New Zealand Communist Party "has grown stronger and more prestigious due to its adherence to Marxism-Leninism."

	Hill said, "We highly appreciate your firm stance in defending the cause of Marxism-Leninism and opposing modern revisionism. This is not, as some people claim, a matter of isolation. On the contrary, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the socialist revolution, and national independence are in the genuine interests of more than ninety percent of the people, except for a small clique of monopoly capitalists."

	Hill recalled, "In 1914, in the vast sea of revisionism, only Lenin's party held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. At that time, some people shouted about isolation, dogmatism, sectarianism, and so on. But Lenin's party was not isolated; instead, it proved to be correct. Its position was the position of people with courage and confidence. Today, the situation has developed. The powerful Communist Party of China has become the iron pillar of Marxism-Leninism. Now there are powerful Marxist-Leninist forces. In this regard, the glorious contribution of the New Zealand Communist Party to the cause of Marxism-Leninism will never be forgotten." Hill emphasized, "The parties that jointly uphold Marxism-Leninism—the great Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, your party, the Belgian Communist Party, our party, and many other parties—have gained the genuine respect and support of the oppressed peoples of the world."

	When discussing the struggle against revisionism within Australia, Hill said, "Our party has been steadfast in defending or striving to defend Marxism-Leninism... Those who have accepted revisionism have split from Marxism-Leninism and communism. Their betrayal has purified the communist movement."

	Hill said, "In the past few years, we have all, as Marxist-Leninists, grown stronger, and now we can analyze specific situations more concretely than ever before." Because, "now we can use the most powerful weapon of dialectics to understand contradictions, that is, things are always divided into two." Hill stressed, "The revisionists have split away. One is divided into two. Marxism-Leninism has greatly strengthened and gained new vitality, while the Australian revisionist group is disintegrating." He pointed out that Australian Marxist-Leninists are vigorously fighting "to consolidate the position of ideological, political, and organizational rupture with revisionism."

	Hill said, "Thus, we are happy today to be with you in celebrating the great progress made by Marxist-Leninists worldwide. Who can deny that, due to the struggle between revisionism and Marxism-Leninism, the great principles of Marxism-Leninism have become more powerful than ever before? Who can deny that dialectical materialism is now more of an issue to be grasped by the masses than it was a few years ago? Who can deny that the aggressive nature of imperialism is more clearly recognized by people than it was a few years ago? Who can deny that the necessity of revolutionary struggle against capitalism, the smashing of the capitalist state machine, and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat is more clearly recognized by people than it was a few years ago? Who can deny that the struggle for national independence is more clearly recognized by people than it was a few years ago? Who can deny that the important connection between the struggle to improve the economic conditions of the working people, the struggle for democratic rights, and the struggle for other partial demands and the overall struggle for socialism is more clearly recognized by people than it was a few years ago?"

	When discussing the construction and development of the party, Hill emphasized, "We highly value Lenin's teachings and the tenth point of the general line of the international communist movement proposed by the Chinese (Communist) Party—the party must be able to work according to the situation, in legal and illegal, secret and open, peaceful and non-peaceful forms. The experience of our Indonesian comrades is a bad thing, but it is also a good thing because it contains rich lessons. Refuting the concept of peaceful transition to socialism is of profound significance, and we must fully understand this. Our estimate is that revolutionary upheavals are developing worldwide. Australia is no exception. We are trying to deeply understand the meaning of Mao Zedong's words: 'Some capitalist countries also allow the Communist Party to exist legally, but only to the extent that it does not harm the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie. Beyond this limit, it is not allowed.'"

	Hill also emphasized, "Our comrades pay special attention to Mao Zedong's 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction,' considering them an indispensable part of our party's development. These works have opened many doors for us in mass work and theoretical understanding. These works enable us to challenge many of our outdated ideas, re-examine them, take the essence, and discard the dross."

### 澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔说马列主义党得到全世界被压迫人民的支持  中共是马列主义的钢铁般的中流砥柱  革命的激变正在全世界发展，澳大利亚也不例外

    澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔说马列主义党得到全世界被压迫人民的支持
    中共是马列主义的钢铁般的中流砥柱
    革命的激变正在全世界发展，澳大利亚也不例外
    新华社二十九日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席希尔在一篇讲话中强调指出，同修正主义者所诬蔑的相反，坚持马克思列宁主义的政党并不孤立；今天，“强大的中国共产党成为马克思列宁主义的钢铁般的中流砥柱，现在存在着强大的马克思列宁主义的力量”，它们“得到了全世界被压迫人民的真正的尊敬和支持。”
    五月三十一日出版的第二十期《澳大利亚共产党人》刊载了希尔四月间在新西兰共产党第二十一次代表大会上发表的这篇讲话。
    希尔在讲话中赞扬“新西兰共产党对所有的马克思列宁主义者是一个鼓舞。它越来越强大”。“在修正主义的汪洋大海中，以威尔科克斯同志为首的新西兰共产党，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的永远放射着光芒的思想的鼓舞下，巍然不动。”新西兰共产党“由于坚持马克思列宁主义，力量和威信增长和提高了。”
    希尔说：“我们对你们维护马克思列宁主义的事业、反对现代修正主义的鲜明立场表示非常钦佩。这绝不是象一些人所说的什么处于孤立的问题。相反，无产阶级专政、社会主义革命和民族独立是符合除了一小撮垄断资本家以外的百分之九十以上的人民的真正利益的。”
    希尔追述说：“在一九一四年，在修正主义汪洋大海中只有列宁的党高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。当时，有一些人叫嚷孤立、教条主义、宗派主义等等。但是，列宁的党不但没有被孤立，反而证明是正确的。它的立场是有勇气和信心的人们的立场。今天，形势发展了。强大的中国共产党成为马克思列宁主义的钢铁般的中流砥柱，现在存在着强大的马克思列宁主义的力量。在这方面，新西兰共产党对马克思列宁主义事业的光荣贡献是永远不会被忘记的。”希尔强调指出：“共同坚持马克思列宁主义的那些党——伟大的中国共产党，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，你们的党，比利时共产党，我们的党和许多其他的党，得到全世界被压迫人民的真正的尊敬和支持。”
    希尔在谈到澳大利亚马列主义者反对国内的修正主义的斗争时说：“我们的党是坚持不渝地维护了或努力维护马克思列宁主义的党……那些接受了修正主义的人从马克思列宁主义，从共产主义分裂出去了。他们的背叛使共产主义运动纯洁了。”
    希尔说：“过去几年，我们大家作为马克思列宁主义者都增强了力量，现在我们能够比以往更好地具体分析具体情况。”因为，“现在我们能够运用辩证法这个最有力的武器认识矛盾，即事物永远是一分为二的”。希尔强调说，“修正主义分子分裂出去了。一分为二。马克思列宁主义大大加强了力量，并且获得了新的活力”，而“澳大利亚修正主义集团在分崩离析”。他指出，澳大利亚马克思列宁主义者正在大力进行斗争，“以巩固在意识形态上、政治上和组织上同修正主义决裂的立场”。
    希尔说：“这样，我们今天在这里同你们一起为马克思列宁主义者在全世界取得远大的进展而感到高兴。谁能否认，由于修正主义和马克思列宁主义这两个对立面的斗争，马克思列宁主义的伟大原理的威力比以前更加强大了呢？谁能否认，辩证唯物主义今天比几年以前更加是一个要由群众来掌握的问题了呢？谁能否认，帝国主义的侵略本性比几年以前更清楚地为人们所认识了呢？谁能否认，对资本主义进行革命斗争，粉碎资本主义国家机器和建立无产阶级专政的必要性，比几年以前更清楚地为人们所认识了呢？谁能否认，争取民族独立的斗争比几年以前更清楚地为人们所认识了呢？谁能否认，争取改善劳动人民的经济状况、争取民主权利以及争取其他局部要求的斗争与争取社会主义的全面斗争之间的重要联系，比几年以前更清楚地为人们所认识了呢？”
    希尔在谈到党的建设和发展的问题时强调说：“我们非常重视列宁的教导和中国（共产）党关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议第十点中提出的教导——我们的党必须能够根据情况，以合法的与非法的，秘密的与公开的，和平的与非和平的形式进行工作。我们的印度尼西亚同志们的遭遇是坏事，但是这也是好事，因为在这方面它包含丰富的教训。驳斥和平过渡到社会主义的概念具有深远的意义，我们必须充分了解这一点。我们的估计是，革命的激变正在全世界发展。澳大利亚也不例外。我们在设法深刻领会毛泽东的这番话的含义：‘有些资本主义国家也容许共产党合法存在，但是以不危害资产阶级的根本利益为限度，超过这个限度就不容许了。’”
    希尔还强调指出：“我们的同志们特别注意毛泽东的《实践论》和《矛盾论》，认为这是我们作为一个党的发展所必不可少的部分。这些著作在群众工作和认识理论方面为我们敞开了许多大门。这些著作使我们能够对我们的许多陈旧观念挑战，重新加以考验，取其精华，去其糟粕。”
