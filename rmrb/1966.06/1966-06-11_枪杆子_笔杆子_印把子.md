    Gun Barrel, Pen Barrel, and Seal Handle
    Xin Wu
    The issue of the seal handle – the issue of political power – is the fundamental issue of revolution. After the proletariat seizes the seal handle, it can achieve liberation politically and economically; it can exercise dictatorship over the reactionary classes; it can build a new socialist economy and culture… In short, with the seal handle, one has everything.

    To seize the seal handle from the hands of the reactionary classes, the proletariat must rely on two armies: the army that holds guns, and the army that holds pens. When summarizing the experience of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao said: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, and among them, we can also say that there are two fronts, one military and one civilian, that is, the cultural front and the military front." "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The army that holds guns is the most important force for seizing the seal handle; "but it is not enough to have only this kind of army, we must also have an army of culture, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy."

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people relied on the two armies, military and civilian, and after a long period of struggle, finally seized the seal handle.

    However, the reactionary classes will never be reconciled after losing the seal handle, and will always try every possible means to carry out restoration activities. Restoration means seizing back the seal handle. What do the overthrown reactionary classes rely on to carry out restoration? They also use both the pen and the sword. The sword is to use gun barrels to carry out violent subversion; the pen is to use pen barrels to carry out spiritual subversion. Under the increasingly powerful conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, it is not easy to engage in the "sword" approach; therefore, they put their main force on the "pen" approach.

    The bourgeois "scholars' rebellion" against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought on the ideological and cultural front in our country over the past seventeen years since liberation is such a struggle to prepare public opinion for capitalist restoration, such a conspiracy to seize back the seal handle through the pen barrel.

    As the saying goes, "A scholar's rebellion takes three years to fail." One cannot view the "rebellion" of the bourgeois "scholars" in socialist society in this way. Wearing the cloak of Marxism and wielding their pen barrels, they engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist propaganda, doing the dirty work of poisoning the souls of the people. From their class instinct, they deeply know the power of "winning hearts is paramount." "Success comes naturally with enough effort." If people's souls are bourgeoisified, it will prepare the ideological foundation for them to seize back the gun barrel and the seal handle.

    Chen Jingyi in the Yang Opera "Seizing the Seal" uses the tactic of winning hearts to pull over the production brigade leader, with the aim of "seizing the seal." These anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois "scholars" are like Chen Jingyi on the ideological and cultural front, and their aim is to "seize" the lost "seal" for the overthrown reactionary classes. Didn't Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, write these two lines of poetry: "Don't say scholars only talk idly, their blood stains the ground where their heads are thrown." See, in order to "seize the seal," they are willing to sacrifice even their own "heads." Don't underestimate these "scholars," if their conspiracy succeeds, we will face the danger of national subjugation, Party destruction, and losing our heads!

    When the proletariat is in a subordinate position, the issue of the seal handle is the fundamental issue of revolution; after the proletariat has seized power, the issue of the seal handle is still the fundamental issue – the fundamental issue of defending the fruits of revolutionary victory and ensuring that the revolution is carried through to the end. The fact that the seal handle of the Soviet working people was usurped by the Soviet revisionist leading group shows that the proletariat can lose the seal handle even after gaining it. Forgetting the seal handle means forgetting class struggle and losing everything.

    The ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is a major event to defend the seal handle. In order to prevent the seal handle from being lost after being gained, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry this great revolution through to the end!

    枪杆子·笔杆子·印把子
    辛午
    印把子的问题——政权问题，是革命的根本问题。无产阶级夺得了印把子以后，就可以在政治上、经济上得到解放；就可以对反动阶级实行专政；就可以建设社会主义的新经济、新文化……。总之，有了印把子，就有了一切。
    无产阶级从反动阶级的手中夺取印把子，要依靠两支军队：手里拿枪的军队，手里拿笔的军队。毛主席在总结中国革命经验的时候，这样说过：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。”“枪杆子里面出政权”，手里拿枪的军队，是夺取印把子最重要的力量；“但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队”。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，依靠文武两支军队，经过长期的斗争，终于夺得了印把子。
    但是反动阶级在失去了印把子以后，决不会甘心，总是要千方百计进行复辟活动的。复辟，就是夺回印把子。被推翻了的反动阶级靠什么来搞复辟呢？也是文武两手。武，就是用枪杆子来搞暴力颠覆；文，就是用笔杆子来搞精神颠覆。在无产阶级专政日益强大的条件下，要搞武的这一手，不太容易；所以，他们就把自己的主要力量用在文的这一手上了。
    我国解放十七年来思想文化战线上的反党反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的资产阶级的“秀才造反”，就是这样一种为资本主义复辟进行舆论准备的斗争，就是这样一种阴谋通过笔杆子来夺回印把子的斗争。
    俗话说：“秀才造反，三年不成。”对于社会主义社会里的资产阶级“秀才”们的“造反”，可不能这样看。他们披着马克思主义的外衣，舞弄着笔杆子，搞反党反社会主义的宣传，干的是毒化人民群众灵魂的勾当。他们从自己的阶级本能出发，深知“攻心为上”的厉害。“功到自然成”。如果人们的灵魂都资产阶级化了，就为他们夺回枪杆子和印把子准备了思想基础。
    扬剧《夺印》里的陈景宜，施展攻心战术，把生产大队长拉过去，目的是为了“夺印”。这些反党反社会主义的资产阶级的“秀才”就是思想文化战线上的陈景宜，他们的目的是为被推翻了的反动阶级来“夺”失去的“印”。“三家村”黑店的掌柜邓拓，不是写过这样两句诗吗：“莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑。”请看，为了“夺印”，他们连自己的“头颅”都是在所不惜的。千万别小看这些“书生”，他们的阴谋如果得逞，我们就有亡国亡党亡头的危险！
    当无产阶级处在被统治地位的时候，印把子问题是革命的根本问题；无产阶级掌握了政权之后，印把子问题仍然是根本问题——保卫革命胜利果实和保证把革命进行到底的根本问题。苏联劳动人民的印把子，被苏联修正主义领导集团篡夺的事实表明：无产阶级在掌握了印把子之后，是可能得而复失的。忘记了印把子，就是忘记了阶级斗争，就会失去一切。
    当前，正在我国轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一桩保卫印把子的大事。为了不让印把子得而复失，我们就一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把这场大革命进行到底！
