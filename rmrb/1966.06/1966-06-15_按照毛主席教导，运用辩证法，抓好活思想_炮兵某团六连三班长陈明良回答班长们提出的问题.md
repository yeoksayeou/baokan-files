    Editor's Note: The experiences of Chen Mingliang, a squad leader of the Sixth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army artillery, in grasping living thoughts, is a model of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works and using Mao Zedong Thought to solve ideological problems in the military. This squad leader’s experience is applicable not only to the military but also to factories, rural areas, government agencies, schools, enterprises, and institutions.

    Chairman Mao said: "Grasping ideological education is the central link in uniting the entire Party to carry out great political struggles. If this task is not resolved, all the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." We should follow Chairman Mao’s teachings and always place political and ideological work in a primary position. To do good ideological work and grasp living thoughts, the most fundamental thing is to organize everyone to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, to work hard on the word "apply," and to use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the ideological trends of the masses, and to answer and solve various ideological problems.

    Chen Mingliang is very good at grasping living thoughts. He is good at using the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to look at all people and all things. He makes specific analyses of everything, so his handling of problems is relatively correct and comprehensive.

    We should attach importance to the role of thought, to the role of socialist thought, and to the role of Mao Zedong Thought, using the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great socialist thought to inspire the enthusiasm of the people. As long as we always and everywhere use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, promote everything, and transform everything, we will certainly be able to unite and educate the broad masses of people, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and push forward the cause of socialist construction!

    Recently, Chen Mingliang, a squad leader of the Third Squad of the Sixth Company of a certain artillery regiment of the Jinan Military Region artillery, and soldier Zhou Mingqi, gave a touring report to the entire regiment, introducing their experience in carrying out the "one-pair-red" activity, which was warmly welcomed by comrades, especially squad leaders. During the report, people listened attentively. During breaks, many people surrounded them asking questions and requesting answers. Based on the opinions of the masses, the leaders of the regiment decided to hold small Q&A sessions after each report, with representatives from each company participating, and they would answer the questions raised by everyone. The Q&A sessions were unique, lively, and dynamic. Comrades asked questions on the spot, and Chen Mingliang and Zhou Mingqi answered them on the spot. They spoke very vividly and concretely, full of dialectical materialism, reasoning on the basis of facts, simple and profound, and very practical. Everyone praised their reports and answers to questions, saying that they applied Mao Zedong Thought very well, provided good experience for grasping living thoughts, and provided a model for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works.

    Such Q&A sessions were held a total of nine times in the regiment, with more than 140 people participating, raising a total of 53 questions. Here is a summary of the records of Comrade Chen Mingliang's answers to several questions related to "Applying Dialectics and Grasping Living Thoughts."

    Scout Squad Leader Cui Shoumian said:

    I also really want to grasp living thoughts well, but sometimes I can't grasp them accurately or solve them well. You said:

    Where should I start grasping living thoughts, and how can I grasp them accurately?

    Answer: Comrade Lin Biao called on us to adhere to the four firsts, especially to grasp living thoughts greatly and firmly. Therefore, grasping living thoughts well should become the primary responsibility of the squad leader. The purpose of grasping living thoughts is to arm the minds of soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought and raise everyone's awareness. As long as the goal can be achieved, it can be grasped from any angle.

    Grasping living thoughts should start with positive education. Once, soldier Sui Wenli took the canvas from the artillery depot window to nail a small bench. I did not simply criticize him, but used the spirit of Sun Leyi and Wang Jie of being selfless and diligent and thrifty to enlighten him. He quickly realized his mistake. I immediately praised him for daring to correct his shortcomings and joined him in re-nailing the canvas to the artillery depot window. In this way, he was not only educated but also felt happy. Later, he continuously washed bed sheets and made washbasin stands for all the comrades in the squad, doing many good deeds.

    To grasp living thoughts accurately, an important point is to follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, investigate and study, and one-divides-into-two. One-divides-into-two is the core of dialectical materialism. Violating the one-divides-into-two viewpoint will lead to setbacks.

    Once, when helping the masses fight drought, soldier Liu Guangfu insisted on rocking the waterwheel for a day with great enthusiasm, and I was preparing to praise him. But when I came back at night, he was lying on the bed, and he didn't even eat when I asked him to eat. I felt something was wrong and criticized him a few times. This criticism made him feel down for a long time. Later I thought, why discard people's advantages and only look at their shortcomings? This is a lesson. Learning a lesson improves one's understanding. Last year, when we did the "Three Autumns" work, the comrades in the squad were very active. One day, Liu Guangfu and two other comrades went to watch the mountain at night. The next morning, as soon as I got up, I pushed the cart up the mountain. Far from the production site, I saw only two people working. When I got there, I saw that Liu Guangfu was not yet awake. At that time, I wanted to get angry again, but I held back. After a while, I saw Liu Guangfu coming, and he limped when he worked. After learning about it, I realized that athlete's foot had festered on his foot. During the break, I praised him for still wading across the river to watch the mountain even with festering athlete's foot, and asked everyone to learn from him. In this way, not only did he do a good job in the future, but all aspects of his work became more active.

    Scout Squad Leader He Mingzheng said:

    Some people's living thoughts are exposed, and it is easy to see them. Some people's living thoughts are not exposed, and it is not easy to see them. Please tell me:

    How can living thoughts be understood in time?

    Answer: The squad leader must first take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works well, improve his own ideological awareness, and deeply and thoroughly understand the policies, guidelines, and instructions of the superiors. In this way, with a compass in mind, one can be ideologically keen and can discover one's own problems and the problems of the squad in time. If one's own awareness is not high and one is very selfish, one will not only not be able to see the problems of the comrades in the squad, but one will not dare to grasp them even if one sees them. To analyze living thoughts, one must study Chairman Mao’s teachings well and study the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao. With these grasped, there is a yardstick for measuring living thoughts; otherwise, one will not be clear about oneself, let alone grasp living thoughts.

    Secondly, one must do in-depth investigation and research and be a person with a heart, with a confidant account for everyone. One must understand the general situation of the comrades in the squad, such as their origin, class background, native place, specialty, hobbies, etc., and also understand some specific situations unique to each comrade. For example, some comrades’ families are in disaster areas, and their families bear a heavy burden, which often affects their mood; some comrades like to express opinions to him straightforwardly, while others need to be criticized in a different way; those who have been "Five-Good" soldiers for many years may develop a sense of complacency, while those who have not been rated as "Five-Good" for several years often develop a sense of discouragement, etc. The more and deeper one understands, the easier it is to grasp the beating of the soldiers' ideological pulse. What the comrades are thinking and doing is clear at a glance, and one can grasp the point.

    In addition, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses. Grasping living thoughts by one person alone will not be accurate or complete. It is necessary to rely on everyone to grasp them. After problems are grasped, it is also necessary to analyze where the main contradictions lie. If the common problems of the whole squad or the main contradictions in individuals are grasped, they can be solved one by one in a targeted manner through collective study of Chairman Mao’s works, "one-pair-red" heart-to-heart talks, individual self-study, and other methods.

    Surveying Squad Leader Fu Jinzhi said:

    Some comrades’ problems are difficult to solve, and it is ineffective even after talking about them several times. Please tell me:

    What should I do if grasping living thoughts is not effective for a while?

    Answer: The development of things has a law. From small to large, from weak to strong, from backward to advanced, there must be a transformation process. It cannot be imagined that wrong ideas can be changed all at once. To make people have a great leap after talking to them a few times is not in line with the law of the development of things. If some comrades’ problems occur again after they have been grasped, a specific analysis must be made: Is it a repetition of the mistake, or a repeated struggle in the process of progress? It is necessary to distinguish clearly. Zhou Mingqi's gradual correction of the shortcoming of arguing with comrades is a very good example. At first, he refused to admit his mistakes when he was wrong; later, he could do a little self-examination, but he was unconvinced and unwilling to admit his mistakes in person; later, he studied Chairman Mao's works and improved his awareness, and was able to actively apologize after a dispute occurred. On the surface, he still often quarreled with people in the process of progress, but the situation of each time was different, and the attitude of each time was different. If one only sees him quarreling and thinks that the work done has not worked, and does not patiently help him, it will dampen his enthusiasm and affect his continued correction of shortcomings. Because a specific analysis is made of each of his quarrels, his shortcomings are pointed out in a realistic way, his small progress is praised, and his awareness is continuously improved, after a repeated process, his problem of quarreling is finally completely corrected. Therefore, to measure the effect of grasping living thoughts, it is necessary to look at the problem in depth and not be confused by surface phenomena; otherwise, one will not have enough confidence in grasping living thoughts.

    Artillery Squad Leader Jiang Wanli said:

    I just became a squad leader and really want to talk to everyone. I have talked to them a lot, but it's not "warm" and it's very difficult to handle. Please introduce me:

    How to talk to comrades?

    Answer: Talking is telling the truth. To achieve this, one must:

    1. Treat people equally and put down your airs. You can't feel like you are above others. It is not okay to put on the airs of "educating" people, and it is even more impossible to subdue people by force. For some days, Comrade Han Tianping was unwilling to talk to me. After understanding, I realized that he felt that my tone of speech was blunt, so he was unwilling to talk to me. I accepted his criticism, and I also studied Chairman Mao's works, and realized that this was a fundamental attitude problem. After my attitude changed, he was also willing to talk to me about his inner thoughts.

    2. Be understanding. The warmth and coldness, and the hardships of the soldiers, the squad leader must know at all times. The squad leader must confide in the soldiers, so that the soldiers will feel close and willing to confide in you. Exposing one's heart is not the goal, but to help each other with deep class feelings and solve the problem.

    3. Dare to take responsibility and dare to admit shortcomings to comrades. If comrades have shortcomings, and there are problems in the squad, do not simply blame the comrades, but look for your own responsibilities. In this way, you can talk to each other, and your hearts can be close to each other.

    4. Have the spirit of not being discouraged when comrades encounter setbacks, and not giving up until the goal is achieved for the revolution. Talking sometimes does not go well, and one should not be discouraged. In order to help class brothers well, one must be patient and not be afraid of trouble.

    Putting these together is called talking, knowing, confiding, caring, and not giving up until class brothers are helped well.

    Motor Squad Leader Liu Qinglian said:

    There is a soldier in our squad who likes to get angry. When I talk to him, if I say it lightly, he doesn't take it seriously, and if I say it a little harder, he explodes. What I am worried about now is:

    How can I solve the problem and not cause an explosion?

    Answer: To solve the problem and not cause an explosion is not just a method problem, but also an attitude problem. I think two relationships should be clarified:

    One is the relationship between big and small. Being a squad leader is both big and small. Saying it is big means that the squad leader has a big responsibility and a heavy burden. If a squad is going to fight, and the people in this squad do not have proletarian consciousness, they will not be able to fight well. People's consciousness is not innate, but is nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. The squad leader must help the soldiers study Chairman Mao's works well. From this point of view, the squad leader's burden is really not light, and the responsibility is really great. Seeing these, one can always think about the revolutionization of the soldiers. As long as it is in line with the interests of the people, one will patiently manage it to the end and will not let it go. Saying that the squad leader is small means that the squad leader's airs should be small, and one should have the spirit of being willing to be a primary school student, and one should have the spirit of thinking that one is wrong. One must always remember that one cannot be divorced from the masses, one must treat people equally, and one must have the attitude of making revolution with the soldiers, learning from each other, and helping each other. If one always puts one's own position high and puts on an air of transforming people, then it may cause an explosion.

    The other is the relationship between managing and being managed. It is often unclear who manages whom between the squad leader and the soldiers. Who manages whom after all? I think they manage each other, but the soldiers manage the squad leader more. The squad leader's words and deeds, and every move, affect everyone all the time, and everyone can see it clearly. In order to do a good job in the revolution, everyone should and can help the squad leader, manage the squad leader's thoughts, and manage the squad leader's work. Clarifying the relationship between managing and being managed means that talking is not "the squad leader speaks and the soldiers listen, and the squad leader criticizes without saying a word," but mutual responsibility, mutual education, mutual assistance, and mutual encouragement. In this way, not only will it not cause an explosion, but the problem will also be solved better.

    Guard Squad Leader Ren Qingdong said:

    Some people have shortcomings, and you say something and they examine themselves, but they commit them again afterwards and always cannot change them. Talk about:

    Why does it not work no matter how many times you say it?

    Answer: Speaking depends on how you speak. Training people according to personal ideas is speaking, and helping with full class feelings is also speaking; talking about things as they are is speaking, and using Chairman Mao's teachings to improve awareness is also speaking. Different ways of speaking have different effects.

    For a period of time, I was very strict in grasping internal hygiene and said a lot about it. What I thought was to strive for first place, so when I said it, I always said how to do a good job, how to strive for first place, and so on, so-called words of encouragement. The comrades were still energetic when they first heard it, but it stopped working later. Seeing a problem, I would say something. It seemed like I was speaking, but the comrades did not know what you were talking about and why. Naturally, they could not change. Saying things should be reasonable and reasonable, so that everyone can be inspired and educated from the depths of their minds when they hear them. Naturally, there will be an effect. Later, I combined the arrangement of internal affairs with combat readiness and explained revolutionary principles, which inspired everyone's consciousness, and internal hygiene was maintained for a long time.

    In addition, some problems that the squad leader thinks should be said are not necessarily all correct. Using training people instead of reasoning will only make things worse. Of course, sometimes the squad leader is right and the truth is explained clearly, but some comrades may not be able to realize it for a while. This is not uncommon. People's ideological level and cognitive ability are different. Changing a shortcoming is not something that can be done by saying a few words. Saying is only an external condition, and it must also be changed through the internal cause.

    In a word, the squad leader must speak. Things that are beneficial to the Party and the people should be praised and promoted through speaking; words and deeds that are detrimental to the Party and the people should be stopped through speaking. This speaking is speaking with Mao Zedong Thought, speaking with sincere class feelings. If speaking once is not enough, speak twice, three times, repeatedly, and patiently. As long as what is said is reasonable and can be said patiently, there will definitely be good results.

    Artillery Squad Leader Liu Yuan said:

    Some people have put a lot of effort into helping backward comrades, but the effect is not obvious, so they lose confidence and become impatient. Please talk about:

    What attitude should be used to help backward soldiers?

    Answer: Treat backward soldiers according to Chairman Mao’s teachings, unite with them with deep class feelings, get close to them, and use Mao Zedong Thought to help them and educate them. In the process of uniting and educating, several issues should be clarified:

    1. Distinguish between patiently waiting and passively waiting. The process of patiently waiting is the process of actively educating. Education will involve struggle. We cannot relax our grip on wrong things and must actively help with the spirit of treating illness and saving people. If we understand patience as relaxation, it will be biased.

    2. Distinguish between one-divides-into-two and evenly dividing-into-two. In order to criticize, one forcibly praises first, and as a result, the praised person feels very uncomfortable. One-divides-into-two is a scientifically correct way to analyze a person, which is to be realistic. We must never exaggerate his achievements by deviating from the facts and forcibly pull his merits on him. The effect of doing that would be very bad.

    3. Distinguish between necessary material care and material incentives. Necessary material care, sincerely solving people’s practical problems, is conducive to the effect of ideological education. However, we must put ideological education first. Material without class feelings is a material incentive, which is hot for a while and then cools off, and sometimes it has a reverse effect.

    4. Distinguish between trouble and not being a trouble. Old ideas cannot be transformed all at once. One must have the spirit of not being afraid of trouble, and one must be willing to work hard to help one’s class brothers improve their ideological awareness. Being afraid of trouble is more trouble, and it is not being wholeheartedly responsible to the people.

    Telephone Squad Leader Zhao Jingye said:

    The New Year's Day editorial of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* called for: "Achieving one heart in one squad, one heart in one platoon, one heart in one company..." I think this is very important, but our squad is not of one heart. What I need to solve now is:

    How to turn one heart per person into one heart for the whole squad?

    Answer: The comrades in a squad come from all over the country. Their situations are different, and their experiences before joining the army are different. There will be some problems when everyone is together. Don't be afraid of this. We must think of ways to use Mao Zedong Thought to do a good job in uniting our hearts, unifying the thoughts of all comrades in the squad, and serving the revolution wholeheartedly. Only in this way can we better complete various tasks. This task is not simple if you say it is simple, and not complicated if you say it is complicated, because most of our comrades are poor and lower-middle peasants, and their class interests are consistent. With the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the hearts of all comrades in the squad can be completely integrated. I have a few experiences on how to do it:

    1. The squad leader himself must first strengthen revolutionization, stand high, see far, be ideologically red, and have a strong work style, in order to lead everyone to study Chairman Mao’s works and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. But in this regard, my gap is not small.

    2. Grasp the key link of class education. The squad leader must find out the history of blood and tears of each soldier’s family, and often inspire everyone to recall the past suffering, so that all the comrades in the squad realize that everyone is a melon on the same bitter vine and are all class brothers. When everyone’s class feelings are strong and their class consciousness is raised, they will not quarrel over trivial matters, and they will unite and fight for the common revolutionary goal.

    3. The unity obtained from struggle is real, and the unity of "peaceful coexistence" is false. Arguments between comrades are not to be feared. One cannot be satisfied with not arguing or quarreling, and one cannot be afraid of the struggle between truth and error. After the struggle, clarifying right and wrong, overcoming the wrong ones, and promoting the right ones, the unity will move forward a step further.

    4. Carry out the "one-pair-red" activity well. In practice, not only is it required that the "one-pair-red" should talk to each other, confide in each other, help each other, and have hearts linked to each other, but it is also necessary to often inspire everyone to establish the idea of collectivism and the idea of all-red.

    5. Often use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to educate individuals and everyone. Facts have proved that whenever criticism and self-criticism are actively carried out in the squad, the unity in the squad will be done well.

    按照毛主席教导，运用辩证法，抓好活思想
    ——炮兵某团六连三班长陈明良回答班长们提出的问题
    编者按：解放军某团六连班长陈明良关于抓活思想的体会，是活学活用毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想解决部队思想问题的一个范例。这个班长的经验，不仅适用于部队，而且适用于工厂、农村、机关、学校和企业、事业单位。
    毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们应该遵循毛主席的教导，在任何时候都要把政治思想工作摆在首要地位。要做好思想工作，抓好活的思想，最根本的一条，就是要组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想去分析群众的思想动态，去回答和解决各种思想问题。
    陈明良很会抓活思想，他善于运用一分为二的观点去看待一切人、一切事。对待任何事情，都作具体分析，处理问题就比较正确，比较全面。
    我们应该重视思想的作用，重视社会主义思想的作用，重视毛泽东思想的作用，用伟大的毛泽东思想，伟大的社会主义思想去激发人民的热情。只要我们时时处处用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切，就一定能够团结和教育广大群众，把社会主义革命进行到底，把社会主义建设事业推向前进！
    最近，济南部队炮兵某团六连三班长陈明良和战士周明岐，在全团巡回报告，介绍他们开展“一对红”活动的经验，受到了同志们，特别是班长们的热烈欢迎。报告时，人们都专心听；一休息，许多人就围上来问这问那，提出许多问题，要求解答。团的领导根据群众的意见，决定在每场报告完后，分别召开小型答问会，各连派代表参加，由他们解答大家提出的问题。答问会别开生面，生动活泼。同志们当场提问，陈明良、周明岐当场回答。他们讲得非常生动具体，充满了唯物辩证法，就事论理，深入浅出，非常实际。大家赞扬他们的报告和问题解答，把毛泽东思想运用得很好，为抓活思想提供了好经验，为活学活用毛主席著作提供了样板。
    这样的答问会在全团共开了九次，有一百四十多人参加，共提出五十三个问题。这里是陈明良同志回答的有关“运用辩证法，抓好活思想”几个问题的记录摘要。
    侦察班长崔寿勉说：
    我也很想抓好活思想，就是有时抓不准，解决不好。你说：
    抓活思想要从哪里入手，怎样才能抓得准？
    答：林彪同志号召：坚持四个第一，特别要大抓狠抓活思想。所以，抓好活思想应该成为班长的首要职责。抓活思想的目的是要用毛泽东思想武装战士头脑，提高大家的觉悟。只要能达到目的，从哪个角度抓都行。
    抓活思想要从正面教育入手。有一次，战士隋文礼把炮库窗子上的帆布拿来钉小板凳。我没有简单批评他，而是用孙乐义、王杰克己奉公、勤俭节约的精神来启发他，他很快认识到自己错了。我马上表扬了他勇于改正缺点，并和他一块重新把帆布钉在炮库窗上。这样做，他既受到教育，又心情舒畅，以后他连续给全班同志洗被单，做脸盆架，做了很多好事。
    要抓准活思想，很重要的一条，就是要按照毛主席的教导，调查研究，一分为二。一分为二是辩证唯物论的核心。违背一分为二这个观点，就要碰钉子。
    有一次，帮助群众抗旱，战士刘广福坚持一天摇水车，干劲很足，我准备表扬他。可是晚上回来，他躺在铺上，叫他吃饭也不吃，我觉得不大对劲，就批评了他几句。这一批评，使他好长时间情绪不高。后来我想，为什么把人家的优点抛开而单看缺点呢，这是个教训。得出了教训，认识就提高了一步。去年搞三秋，班里的同志都很积极。有一天，刘广福等三个同志夜间去看山，第二天早晨一起床，我推着车子上了山。离生产地很远，看见只有两个人干活。到了那里一看，刘广福还没睡醒。当时我又想发火，可我压住了。呆了一会，我看到刘广福来了，他干活时腿一拐一拐的，一了解，才知道他的脚上脚气化了脓。休息的时候，我表扬他脚上脚气化了脓还趟水过河看山的精神，让大家向他学习。这样，他不但在以后干活很好，各方面的工作都更加积极了。
    侦察班长何明政说：
    有些人的活思想暴露出来了，容易看得到，有的人没有暴露出来，不容易看到。请你讲讲：
    活思想怎样才能及时了解？
    答：班长首先要带头学好用好毛主席著作，提高自己的思想觉悟，对上级的政策、方针、指示要领会深，学得透，这样头脑里有了指南针，思想敏锐，才能及时发现自己和班里的问题。如果自己的觉悟不高，私心很重，班里同志有问题，不但看不出来，看出来了，想抓也不敢抓。要分析活思想，就要好好学习毛主席的教导，学习军委、林彪同志的指示。掌握了这些，衡量活思想就有了尺度，不然，自己还不清楚，就更谈不到抓住活思想了。
    其次，要做深入的调查研究，要做有心人，对每个人都有一本知心账。要了解班里同志的出身、成分、籍贯、特长、爱好等等一般情况，还要了解每个同志所特有的一些具体情况。比如有的同志家在灾区，家庭生活负担较重，往往影响情绪；有的同志喜欢开门见山地向他提出意见，而对另外的人批评时就得讲点方式方法；连年的五好战士，可能产生满足情绪，几年没评上五好的，往往产生灰心泄气的情绪等等。了解得越多、越深，就越容易抓住战士思想脉搏的跳动。同志们在想什么，做什么，就一目了然，就能抓到点子上。
    另外，还要充分发动群众。活思想靠一人抓，抓不着，抓不全，必须依靠大家来抓。抓出了问题，还要分析主要的矛盾在哪里。全班共同存在的问题或个人身上的主要矛盾抓出来了，可以通过集体学习毛主席著作，“一对红”谈心帮助，个人自学等多种方式，“对号入座”地一个一个加以解决。
    测地班长傅金芝说：
    有些同志的问题很难解决，说了几次都不见效。请你讲一讲：
    抓活思想一时不能见效怎么办？
    答：事物发展有个规律。由小到大，由弱到强，由后进变先进，都要有一个转化过程，不能设想错误思想一下子就改掉了。对同志谈几次话就想使人家来一个极大的飞跃，这是不符合事物发展规律的。有些同志的问题抓了以后又发生了，这要作具体分析：是错误的重复呢，还是进步过程中的反复斗争？要区分清楚。周明岐逐步改正和同志们吵嘴的缺点，就是一个很好的例子。起初，他是错了不认错；以后能进行一点自我检查，但心服嘴硬，不能当面认错；以后，他学了毛主席著作，提高了觉悟，在发生争吵后就能主动地去道歉了。表面看来，他进步过程中也还常和人吵架，但是一次和一次的情况不一样，一次和一次的态度不一样。如果只看到他在吵架，就以为做的工作没起作用，而对他不耐心帮助了，这就会挫伤他的积极性，影响他继续去改正缺点。由于对他每次吵架都做具体分析，实事求是地指出他的缺点，表扬他的微小进步，不断地提高他的觉悟，这样经过一个反复过程，他吵架的毛病终于彻底改正了。所以，衡量抓活思想的效果，要深入地看问题，不被表面现象迷惑，不然，抓活思想就会信心不足。
    炮班班长姜万里说：
    我刚当班长，很想和大家谈心，谈心次数也不少，就是谈不“热乎”，很不好办。你给介绍介绍：
    怎样和同志们谈心？
    答：谈心是说心里话。要做到这样，就要：
    一、平等待人，放下架子。不能觉着比人家高一头。摆着“教育”人的架子不行，想压服人家更不行。有些日子，韩天平同志不愿和我说话了，经过了解才知道，他感到我说话态度生硬，所以不愿和我谈话。我接受了他的批评，又学习了毛主席著作，认识到这是根本态度问题，自己态度转变了，他也愿和我谈心里话了。
    二、做到知心。战士的冷热疾苦，班长每时每刻都要知道。班长要向战士交心，这样战士才觉得亲热，愿向你交心。心交出来了不是目的，而要以深厚的阶级感情，互相帮助，把问题解决。
    三、敢于承担责任，敢于向同志们承认缺点。同志们有了缺点，班里有了问题，不要单纯指责同志们，而要找自己的责任。这样，话才能说到一块儿，心才能贴到一块儿。
    四、要有帮同志遇到挫折不灰心、为革命不达目的不甘心的精神。谈心有时谈不好，不应该泄气，为了把阶级兄弟帮助好，就要耐心，不要怕麻烦。
    把这些连起来，叫做谈心、知心、交心、关心，不帮助好阶级兄弟不甘心。
    马达班长刘庆莲说：
    我们班有个战士爱发火，我和他谈话，说轻了，他不当回事，说重一点他就崩了。我现在犯愁的是：
    怎么才能又解决问题又谈不崩？
    答：要解决问题又谈不崩，不光是个方法问题，还是个态度问题。我想，应当明确两个关系：
    一个是大和小的关系。当个班长，既大又小。说大，是班长的责任大，担子重。一个班要去打仗，这个班的人没有无产阶级觉悟，是打不好仗的。人的觉悟不是天生的，而是靠毛泽东思想哺育出来的，班长要帮助战士学好毛主席著作。这样看，班长的担子实在不轻，责任实在大。看到这些，就能处处为战士的革命化着想，只要是符合人民利益的，就会耐心地管，管到底，而不会放过。说班长小，就是班长的架子要小，要有甘当小学生的精神，要有自以为非的精神。要时刻记住，不能脱离群众，要平等待人，要有和战士一块革命的态度，相互学习，相互帮助。如果总是把自己的位置摆得大大的，摆出一副改造人的架子，那就可能谈崩了。
    另一个是管和被管的关系。班长和战士谁管谁，往往闹不清楚。到底谁管谁，我看互相都管，而战士管班长管得多些。班长的一言一行，一举一动，都时刻影响着大家，大家也看得清清楚楚，为了干好革命，大家应该、而且可以帮助班长，管班长的思想，管班长的工作。明确了管与被管的关系，谈心就不是“班长发言战士听，班长批评不吭声”了，而是相互负责，相互教育，相互帮助，相互鼓励。这样不但谈不崩，问题也会解决得更好。
    警卫班长任庆东说：
    有的人有了缺点，你说了他就检讨，可过后就又犯了，总是改不了。你谈谈：
    为什么会说了多少次就是不起作用？
    答：说，要看怎么说法，按照个人的想法去训人是说，满怀阶级感情去帮助也是说；就事论事是说，用毛主席的教导去提高觉悟也是说。不同的说法就有不同的效果。
    有一个时期，我对内务卫生抓得很紧，说得也很多。我想的是争个第一，所以在说的时候，总是说怎样搞好，怎么争取第一等等所谓打气的话。同志们开始听了还起劲，但以后就不起作用了。看到问题就说，看起来说了，但是同志们不知你说的什么东西，为什么要这样，自然改不了。说，只要说得合情合理，叫大家听了从思想深处受到启发教育，自然就有效果。后来我结合战备讲整理内务，讲出了革命的道理，启发了大家自觉性，内务卫生就持久地搞好了。
    另外，有些问题，班长认为该说的，不一定全对。用训人代替说理，越说越坏。当然，有时班长说得对，也把道理说清楚了，有的同志一时还可能认识不到。这并不稀奇，人的思想水平和认识能力是有差别的。改一个缺点，不是说几句话可以办到的，说只是外因条件，还必须通过他内因起作用才会改。
    一句话，当班长要说。对党和人民有利的事，就通过说去表扬、去提倡；对党和人民不利的言行，就通过说去制止。这个说，是用毛泽东思想去说，用亲切的阶级感情去说，说一次不行，说两次、三次，反复地说，耐心地说，只要说得有理，又能耐心说，就一定会有好效果。
    炮班班长刘元说：
    有人对帮助后进同志下了不少功夫，效果不明显，就丧失了信心，产生了急躁情绪。请你说说：
    要用什么态度帮助后进战士？
    答：对待后进战士要按毛主席的教导，以深厚的阶级感情去团结他们，去亲近他们，用毛泽东思想去帮助他们，去教育他们。在团结教育的过程中，应弄清几个问题：
    一、耐心等待和消极等待要分清。耐心等待的过程，就是积极教育的过程。教育就会有斗争，对错误的东西不能放松，要本着治病救人的精神积极帮助，把耐心理解为放松，这就偏了。
    二、一分为二和平分为二要分清。为了批评，生硬地先表扬一下，结果表扬得人家很难受。一分为二是科学地正确地去分析一个人，是实事求是，决不能脱离事实去夸大他的成绩，硬往人家身上拉优点，这样效果很不好。
    三、必要的物质关怀和物质刺激要分清。物质上的必要关怀，真心实意解决人家的实际问题，有助于思想教育的效果。但必须要把思想教育摆在首位。没有阶级感情的物质，是物质刺激，热乎一阵，过后凉了，有时还会起反作用。
    四、麻烦和不麻烦的关系要分清。旧思想不是一下子就能改造好的。要有不怕麻烦的精神，为帮助自己的阶级兄弟提高思想觉悟，要肯下功夫。怕麻烦就更麻烦，就不是一心一意向人民负责。
    电话班长赵景业说：
    《解放军报》元旦社论要求：“达到一个班一条心，一个排一条心，一个连一条心……。”我觉得这很重要，可我们班偏偏不是一条心。我现在需要解决的是：
    怎样使一人一条心变全班一条心？
    答：一个班的同志来自五湖四海。彼此的情况不同，入伍前的经历不同。大家在一起，发生些问题，这不要怕。要想法用毛主席的思想做好齐心工作，把全班同志的思想统一起来，一心一意为革命，这才能够更好地完成各项任务。这件工作，说简单不简单，说复杂不复杂，因为我们的同志大都是贫下中农，阶级利益是一致的，有了毛泽东思想的指引，全班同志的心是完全可以融洽在一起的。怎么做法，我有几点体会：
    一、班长自己要首先加强革命化，站得高，看得远，思想红，作风硬，才能以红带红，引导大家学习毛主席著作，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。但在这方面，我的差距不小。
    二、抓住阶级教育这个纲。班长要摸清每个战士家庭的血泪史，经常启发大家回忆过去苦，使全班同志认识到大家都是一条苦藤上的瓜，都是阶级弟兄。大家的阶级感情浓厚了，阶级觉悟提高了，就不会为一些鸡毛蒜皮的事闹不团结，就会为着共同的革命目标而团结奋斗。
    三、从斗争中求得的团结是实在的，“和平共处”的团结是虚假的。同志之间的争论不怕，不能满足于不争不吵，不能怕真理和错误斗。经过斗争，明确了是非，把错误的克服了，正确的发扬了，团结就会向前推进一步。
    四、开展好“一对红”活动。在做法上，不但要求“一对红”之间要谈心、交心、帮心、心连心，而且要经常启发大家树立集体主义思想，树立一片红的思想。
    五、经常以批评与自我批评的武器来教育个人和大家。事实证明，什么时候班里批评与自我批评开展得活跃，班里的团结就搞得好。（原载六月十三日《解放军报》）
