    Display Revolutionary Might
    Xin Wu
    In the upsurge of the socialist cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up to eradicate poisonous weeds, becoming the main force in this great revolution. With heads held high, they have stepped onto the academic and cultural platform, engaging in face-to-face battles with bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities." This is a major event in history.
    Human culture was originally created by the working people. However, in a society with private ownership, the working people, in addition to suffering political and economic oppression, also deeply suffered cultural oppression.
    Under the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese working people have not only become masters of their own affairs politically and economically, but also culturally.
    Bourgeois representatives, proceeding from their class nature, have always looked down on the masses. However, in this great cultural revolution, they have trembled with fear at the power of the revolutionary masses.
    No matter how vicious and cunning the "Three-Family Village" and "Four-Family Village" gangster "brothers" are, the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have used Sun Wukong-like "penetrating eyes" to see through them all. In this class struggle, is there only one "Three-Family Village"? No, "where there are thieves, there is a king; where there are generals, there is a commander," "dig out their roots!" Look how bright the eyes of the masses are, how high their wisdom is, and how rich their struggle experience is!
    The great writer, thinker, and revolutionary Lu Xun said: "Although the common people do not read poetry and books, do not understand historical methods, and do not understand seeking flaws in jade or finding the way in dung, they can see the general situation, distinguish between black and white, and distinguish between right and wrong, often achieving things that lofty and enlightened scholar-officials cannot match."
    The worker, peasant, and soldier masses can distinguish between right and wrong because they have a high degree of class consciousness and clear-cut class feelings. Solang Zhuoma, who came from a Tibetan serf background, said: "The Party is the great savior of our million emancipated serfs, it is our lifeblood. Your vicious attacks on our beloved Party are like cutting the flesh off our bodies and digging out our hearts. We will not spare you!" Having suffered the bitterness of the old society makes one hate the class enemy to the bone. Meng Tai, an old hero of the working class, said: "Whoever attacks our great Party, whoever attacks our great savior - our beloved Chairman Mao, we will fight them to the end, until they are shattered to pieces." Having tasted the sweetness of the new society, one has a strong love for socialism. The masses love Mao Zedong Thought and love socialism. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can generate overwhelming power, making all demons and monsters tremble.
    A socialist cultural revolution with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force is rising. Its momentum is so magnificent and its power is so grand. Like surging waves, it rushes towards the demons and monsters, and will crush and submerge them all!
    For many years, the things of the landlord and bourgeois "masters" have filled our newspapers, books, magazines, screens, and stages; they have "released" enough poison, and bullied people too much. Now is the time for us to rise up to eradicate poisonous weeds and display our divine power. No matter how cleverly those bourgeois representatives disguise themselves - any fake Communists and fake Marxists, we can strip off their painted skin and knock them down completely. We must greatly enhance the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and display the revolutionary might of the proletariat.
    Chairman Mao said sixteen years ago: "The era in which the Chinese were considered uncivilized is over. We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." This great prophecy is coming true!

    大显革命威风
    辛午
    在社会主义文化革命的高潮中，广大工农兵群众，奋起铲除毒草，成了这场大革命中的主力军。他们昂首阔步地登上了学术文化的讲坛，和资产阶级的“学者”、“权威”面对面地开仗了。这是历史上的一件大事。
    人类文化，本来是劳动人民创造的。但是，在私有制的社会里，劳动人民除在政治、经济方面遭受压迫以外，也深受文化的压迫。
    在伟大的党和毛主席的领导下，中国的劳动人民不但在政治上、经济上当了家作了主，而且在文化上当家作主。
    资产阶级代表人物，从他们的阶级本性出发，一向看不起群众。但是，在这场伟大的文化大革命中，他们却心惊胆战地领略了革命群众的威力。
    不管“三家村”“四家村”的黑帮“兄弟”们，心肠是多么狠毒，手法是多么狡猾，以毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众，用孙悟空般的“火眼金睛”，把它们统统识破了。在这场阶级斗争中，难道只有一个“三家村”吗？不，“有贼就有王，有将就有帅”，“把他们老根挖出来”！看，群众的眼睛多么亮，群众的智慧多么高，群众的斗争经验是多么丰富啊！
    伟大的文学家、思想家、革命家鲁迅说过：“老百姓虽然不读诗书，不明史法，不解在瑜中求瑕、屎里觅道。但能从大概上看，明黑白，辨是非，往往有决非清高通达的士大夫所可几及之处的。”
    工农兵群众能够明辨是非，是因为他们有高度的阶级觉悟、爱憎分明的阶级感情。西藏农奴出身的索朗卓玛说：“党是我们百万翻身农奴的大救星，是我们的命根子，你恶毒地攻击我们敬爱的党，就等于用刀子割我们身上的肉，挖我们的心，我们不会饶了你！”受尽旧社会之苦，才会对阶级敌人有刻骨的恨。工人阶级的老英雄孟泰说：“谁攻击我们伟大的党，谁攻击我们伟大的救星——敬爱的毛主席，我们一定同他们拼到底，让他碰得头破血流，直至彻底粉碎。”尝到新社会之甜，才会对社会主义有强烈的爱。群众热爱毛泽东思想，热爱社会主义。毛泽东思想一旦掌握了群众，就能产生排山倒海的威力，使一切牛鬼蛇神发抖。
    一场以工农兵为主力军的社会主义文化大革命正在兴起。它的气势是那么磅礴，力量是那么宏伟。它象汹涌的波涛，一直向牛鬼蛇神们冲去冲去，将把它们统统冲垮、淹没！
    多少年来，地主资产阶级“老爷”们的东西，塞满了我们的报纸、书刊、银幕和舞台；他们“放”得够多了，欺人太甚了，现在是我们奋起铲除毒草、大显神威的时候了。不管那些资产阶级代表人物伪装得多么巧妙，——凡是假共产党、假马克思主义，我们都能剥掉他们的画皮，一塌刮子把他们打倒。我们要大长无产阶级革命的志气，大显无产阶级革命的威风。
    毛主席在十六年前说：“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”这个伟大的预言正在实现！
