    U.S. Imperialism is the Mortal Enemy of the Cuban People
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    The aggressive troops of the United States stationed at the Guantanamo base in Cuba shot and killed a Cuban sentry on May 21. This is another new provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Cuban people among countless provocations. After the incident, the Washington authorities even falsely accused Cuba of provoking the incident and threatened to issue a so-called "protest" to Cuba in a threatening tone. The viciousness of their intentions is obvious. The Chinese people express great indignation at the unreasonable and barbaric provocative actions of U.S. imperialism.

    Since the Caribbean Crisis in October 1962, the United States has been using both hard and soft tactics against Cuba, engaging in economic blockade, military encirclement, and war threats on the one hand, and subversive activities and political deception on the other, in an attempt to disintegrate the revolutionary will of the Cuban people and force them to submit to its pressure, thereby achieving the sinister goal of placing the Cuban people back under its enslavement. The laws of international class struggle are independent of human will. Regarding U.S. imperialism, no matter how Khrushchev revisionists tout its "wisdom," or no matter who fantasizes about engaging in "compromise" with it, attempting to exchange revolutionary principles for some "easing of the situation," U.S. imperialism has never and will never give up its ambition to control Cuba by various means. It is impossible for the Cuban people to coexist peacefully with U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Cuban people.

    The Cuban people are heroic people. They have waged a long-term and courageous struggle against U.S. imperialism. Through the two Declarations of Havana, the Cuban people announced their determination to fight to the end for the genuine independence of Cuba and the liberation of the Americas. During the Caribbean Crisis, the Cuban people put forward five demands to safeguard independence and sovereignty, demanding that the United States stop its aggressive activities threatening Cuban security and its criminal acts violating Cuban sovereignty, including the removal of the Guantanamo base and its return to Cuba. These demands of the Cuban people are completely just. If these five just demands are not upheld, especially if the U.S. aggressive stronghold in Cuba is not removed, how can the constant provocations and threats of the United States against Cuba be eradicated? We believe that as long as the Cuban people hold high the anti-U.S. revolutionary banner of the two Declarations of Havana, adhere to the five just demands, and unite all anti-U.S. revolutionary forces in Latin America and the world to carry out a long-term and unremitting struggle, they will certainly be able to smash the aggression, intervention, and all conspiracies of U.S. imperialism. However, instead of exposing the deceptive nature of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary dual tactics, the Khrushchev revisionists shouted about the need to "normalize" the situation in the Caribbean region. This is clearly to make the Cuban people lay down the anti-U.S. revolutionary banner of the Declarations of Havana, abandon their five just demands, and attempt to have the revolutionary Cuban people engage in some kind of "peaceful coexistence" with the aggressive U.S. imperialism. This is false support and real betrayal of the Cuban people. It runs counter to the fundamental interests of the Cuban people. We have always believed that for the aggressive U.S. imperialism, we must and can only wage a tit-for-tat struggle.

    The Chinese people have always supported the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism. This was true in the past, it is true now, and it will be true in the future. The Chinese people will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of the Cuban people. The Cuban people can always count on the full support of 650 million Chinese people in their just struggle against aggression.

    美帝国主义是古巴人民不共戴天的敌人
    本报评论员
    美国驻在古巴关塔那摩基地的侵略军队，在五月二十一日开枪打死一名古巴哨兵。这是美帝国主义对古巴人民无数次挑衅中的又一次新的挑衅。在事情发生之后，华盛顿当局竟然反诬古巴挑起事端，而且以威胁的口吻表示要向古巴提出所谓“抗议”。其用心之恶毒，是显而易见的。中国人民对美帝国主义横蛮无理的挑衅行为，表示极大的愤慨。
    自从一九六二年十月加勒比海危机以来，美国一直对古巴软硬兼施，一方面搞经济封锁、军事包围和战争威胁，一方面搞颠覆活动和政治欺骗，以图瓦解古巴人民的革命意志，迫使古巴人民在它的压力面前屈服，从而达到把古巴人民重新置于它奴役之下的罪恶目的。国际阶级斗争的规律，是不以人们意志为转移的。对于美帝国主义，不管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者怎样吹捧它“明智”，也不管什么人幻想同它搞什么“妥协”，企图用放弃革命原则来换取什么“和缓局势”，美帝国主义从来没有、而且也决不会放弃它用各种方法控制古巴的野心。古巴人民同美帝国主义是不可能和平共处的。美帝国主义是古巴人民不共戴天的敌人。
    古巴人民是英雄的人民。他们同美帝国主义进行了长期的、英勇的斗争。古巴人民通过两个《哈瓦那宣言》，宣布决心要为古巴的真正独立和美洲的解放而奋斗到底。在加勒比海危机期间，古巴人民提出了维护独立和主权的五项要求，要求美国停止它威胁古巴安全的侵略活动，停止它侵犯古巴主权的罪恶行为，其中包括撤除关塔那摩基地，将它归还古巴。古巴人民的这些要求，是完全正义的。如果不坚持这五项正义要求，特别是如果不把美国在古巴的侵略据点撤除，怎么能够根除美国对古巴不断进行的挑衅和威胁呢？我们相信，古巴人民只要高举两个《哈瓦那宣言》的反美革命旗帜，坚持五项正义要求，联合拉丁美洲和全世界一切反美革命力量，进行长期不懈的斗争，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略、干涉和一切阴谋活动。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不去揭露美帝国主义的反革命两手策略的欺骗性，反而大喊什么要使加勒比海地区的局势“正常化”。这分明是要使古巴人民放下《哈瓦那宣言》的反美革命旗帜，放弃他们的五项正义要求，妄图使坚持革命的古巴人民同侵略成性的美帝国主义搞什么“和平共处”。这是对古巴人民的假支持，真出卖。这是同古巴人民的根本利益背道而驰的。我们一直认为，对侵略成性的美帝国主义，必须、而且只能作针锋相对的斗争。
    中国人民一贯支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。过去如此，现在如此，将来也是如此。中国人民永远是古巴人民最忠实、最可靠的朋友。古巴人民在他们反侵略的正义斗争中，永远可以指望六亿五千万中国人民的全力支持。
