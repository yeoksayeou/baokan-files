    Yinxi Brigade Summarizes the Gains of Leading Commune Members in Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works
    Class Consciousness Comes from Mao Zedong Thought, Revolutionary Enthusiasm Comes from Mao Zedong Thought
    Increased Production Potential Comes from Mao Zedong Thought, Stable and High Yields Come from Mao Zedong Thought
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 22nd – Yinxi Brigade, Yinxi Commune, Fuqing County, Fujian Province, one of the national agricultural models of the Dazhai type, recently summarized the gains of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works and said: "Class consciousness comes from Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary enthusiasm comes from Mao Zedong Thought, increased production potential comes from Mao Zedong Thought, stable and high yields come from Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can advance forever!"
    The cadres and commune members of Yinxi Brigade, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, ensure that they are not complacent when production develops, continue to tap the potential for increased production, work hard, and constantly advance; they do not slacken when their lives become prosperous, cherish the motherland, have the world in mind, and are determined to make greater contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.
    The Yinxi Brigade Party Branch, following Chairman Mao’s teaching that politics is the commander and soul, persistently conducts socialist ideological education for the peasants. In the early days of agricultural collectivization, in order to shake off the label of food shortage, the Yinxi peasants embarked on the path of self-reliance and hard work, fighting hard for a long time to manage mountains, rivers, and fields, achieving continuous increases in production and income for ten consecutive years. Production and life have undergone earth-shaking changes, and the contribution to the country has been increasing year by year. Under these circumstances, some commune members gradually developed complacency, and their enthusiasm slackened somewhat; whenever production plans were formulated, they would say: "Sun Wukong has exhausted his seventy-two transformations, one mu of land is equivalent to three mu, and cows have no place to put their mouths to drink water. It is about enough to maintain this level in the future." And so on. Whenever this situation arises, the brigade party branch always unites the majority of cadres, party members, and activists to persuade and educate these commune members, mobilize the masses to find ways, tap potential, and find ways to increase production; the cadres set an example and take the lead in doing it. Those with backward ideas, seeing that production can indeed be increased, follow suit. In this way, the ideological problem of that year is solved, but ideological problems arise again next year.
    Two years ago, the Yinxi Brigade Party Branch studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is the education of the peasants." From this teaching of Chairman Mao, the Yinxi Brigade Party Branch realized that the primary task of party organizations in rural areas is to arm the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, educate them to establish the idea of farming for the revolution, and gradually expand their horizons from the small family and small collective to the large collective, the whole country, and the whole world, actively guiding them to take the socialist road. Only in this way can the peasants continuously improve their ideological awareness and prevent complacency and slackening. The Yinxi Brigade Party Branch reviewed that in the past, it did not emphasize politics enough, focusing more on production and less on politics, grasping specific ideological education more and fundamental ideological construction less. At the same time, the Party Branch also criticized the erroneous understanding of some cadres that "as long as production is done well and life is improved, the peasants will not have ideological problems," and decided to put the organization of cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, and focus on the ideological revolution of the people.
    The brigade party branch first earnestly organized cadres and party members to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, starting with class education, transforming their world outlook in the spirit of rectification, so that they could lead the way for the commune members. There was a party member cadre in Yinxi Brigade called "Huang Pobu" (Yellow Rag). Before liberation, he was so poor that he was barely covered, and people called him "Rag." Now, his life has improved, he has built a new house, put on new clothes, but he does not care much about the collective and is unwilling to take the lead in labor. Party Branch Secretary Chen Deshun studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "Get Organized!" with him. "Huang Pobu" improved his class consciousness through study and made a painful review of his forgetful thinking. He said: "I can't forget that there are still many poor brothers in the world wearing rags today, I must make revolution to the end!" Since then, he has actively led the masses, taken the lead everywhere, and worked with great enthusiasm.
    Through studying Chairman Mao’s works, the Yinxi Brigade Party Branch improved three systems: a party lesson system centered on propagating Mao Zedong Thought; a system of contacting the masses with visits to the poor and needy as the focus; and an organizational life system with criticism and self-criticism as the content. The implementation of these systems has made the party organization a fighting fortress of Mao Zedong Thought, enabling all the cadres and party members of the brigade to maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and guaranteeing the political leadership of the peasant masses.
    Organizing commune members to study Chairman Mao’s works is also being implemented in the ideological revolution. In the past year, the Yinxi Brigade has repeatedly led commune members to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," guiding them to compare their own thoughts and actions with the shining examples of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and others; and they have also frequently organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's related works, discuss the relationship between farming and revolution, greatly mobilizing their revolutionary enthusiasm. When discussing and formulating this year’s production plan, many commune members linked the development of production with the current domestic and international struggles. Poor peasant woman He Meiying said: "We are living a good life today, we must not forget that two-thirds of our class brothers in the world have not been liberated, and our Vietnamese brothers and sisters are still being bullied by U.S. imperialism. In the past, Norman Bethune came to China from thousands of miles away to help us make revolution. Today, we should work hard to improve production and support the world people's revolution." Production Captain Guo Tianshun, who once had feelings of complacency and slackening, now says: "Chairman Mao teaches us to carry the revolution through to the end. Yinxi's achievement today is only the first step in the Long March. The road of revolution is still long, and our revolutionary responsibility is still great."
    In order to further eliminate the complacency among cadres and commune members, this brigade, in addition to sending some cadres and activists to nearby advanced units to "learn from experience," recently organized two meaningful mass activities in conjunction with the study of Chairman Mao's works. One was to visit the No. 2 Village Brigade of Longtian Commune, where the masses creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works very well. The cadres and commune members were very moved to see that men, women, old and young in No. 2 Village Brigade were studying Chairman Mao's works, learning and applying them, and everyone was full of spirit. Party Branch Secretary Chen Deshun said: "Studying like this is the iron-clad country!" After returning from the visit, the study of Chairman Mao's works became a trend among cadres and commune members. The other was to organize commune members to visit their own brigade, called "Yinxi people look at Yinxi." The commune members watched and discussed. When they saw the reservoir, electric water pump, rice milling machine, tractor, as well as the wide field roads, the scattered irrigation ditches, the power grid, the sugarcane groves, hospitals, and schools, they discussed the origin of these earth-shaking changes. They realized that without the great Party and Chairman Mao, without a strong socialist country, relying solely on Yinxi peasants, these huge changes would not have been possible. To build a new socialist countryside, we must continue to step up production, support socialist revolution and socialist construction, support the world revolution, and overthrow imperialism headed by the United States. At the same time, the commune members also saw that although the production achievements are great, there is still a distinction between advanced and backward, and it is definitely not "increased production to the top." They discussed many new ways to increase production, enhancing their confidence in continuing the revolution and striving for new victories.
    After the two visits, the cadres and commune members of Yinxi Brigade earnestly studied articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Continue to Maintain the Style of Hard Struggle," their revolutionary spirit was greatly boosted, everyone used their brains to think of ways, forming a mass upsurge of offering advice and suggestions. Twenty li away from the village, there is a barren mountain that can be afforested and planted with fruit trees. The brigade plans to organize a distant farming team of 130 people to develop that barren mountain. As a result, more than 300 people signed up to go. Before spring plowing, the commune members carried out high-standard land leveling in the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, increasing the soil layer of more than 700 mu of cultivated land from the original four inches to six inches. Two new channels, totaling fifteen li in length, were built, turning 200 mu of cultivated land that could only grow dry crops into paddy fields, converting them to grow rice. The commune members also straightened a winding channel, expanding 20 mu of cultivated land. In order to increase fertilizer, the river mud was dug out, so the commune members ran to the harbor five or six li away to dig sea mud. They also tapped potential in cultivation techniques, universally adopted advanced seedling raising methods for early rice, transplanted seedlings ten days earlier, which could avoid the threat of typhoons and insect pests; and adopted reasonable transplanting specifications, creating conditions for a substantial increase in production. In this way, the production struggle of Yinxi Brigade has been raised to a new level.

    音西大队总结领导社员活学活用毛主席著作的收获
    阶级觉悟从毛泽东思想来　革命干劲从毛泽东思想来
    增产潜力从毛泽东思想来　稳产高产从毛泽东思想来
    新华社福州二十二日电  全国大寨式农业典型之一、福建省福清县音西公社音西大队最近总结活学活用毛主席著作的收获时说：“阶级觉悟从毛泽东思想来，革命干劲从毛泽东思想来，增产潜力从毛泽东思想来，稳产高产从毛泽东思想来。有了毛泽东思想，就能永远前进！”
    音西大队的干部和社员，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，做到生产发展了不自满，继续挖增产潜力，苦干大干，不断前进；生活富裕了不松劲，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，决心为中国革命和世界革命做出更大的贡献。
    音西大队党总支遵循毛主席的政治是统帅、是灵魂的教导，坚持不懈地对农民进行社会主义思想教育。在农业集体化初期，音西农民为了摘掉缺粮帽子，走上自力更生、勤俭创业的道路，长期艰苦奋斗，治山治水治田，连续十年增产增收，生产、生活都起了翻天覆地的变化，对国家的贡献一年比一年大。在这种情况下，有些社员逐渐滋长了骄傲自满情绪，干劲有些松懈下来；每逢制订生产计划时，他们就说：“孙悟空七十二变都变光了，一亩地顶了三亩用，牛喝水都无处放嘴巴了，往后保持这个水平就差不多了。”等等。逢到这种情况，大队党总支总是团结大多数干部、党员和积极分子，对这些社员进行说服教育，发动群众想办法，挖潜力，找增产门路；干部以身作则，带头去干。那些有落后思想的人，看到确实还能增产，就跟着干起来。这样，当年的思想问题是解决了，但是，来年又产生思想问题。
    两年前，音西大队党总支就带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”音西大队党总支从毛主席这一教导中，认识到农村中党组织的首要任务是，用毛泽东思想武装农民，教育他们树立为革命种田的思想，使他们的眼光从小家庭、小集体的圈子里逐步扩展到大集体、全国、全世界，积极引导他们走社会主义道路。只有这样，农民才能不断地提高思想觉悟，防止自满松劲。音西大队党总支检查了过去突出政治不够，从生产上着眼多，从政治上着眼少，抓具体的思想教育多，抓根本的思想建设少。同时，党总支也批判了一些干部的“只要把生产抓好了，生活改善了，农民就不会有思想问题”的错误认识，决定把组织干部、社员学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，大抓人的思想革命化。
    大队党总支首先认真组织干部、党员活学活用毛主席著作，从阶级教育入手，以整风的精神改造世界观，让他们给社员群众带好路。音西大队有个党员干部叫“黄破布”，解放前穷得衣不遮体，被人叫做“破布”。现在，他生活好了，盖了新房，穿上新衣，却不大关心集体，不愿带头劳动了。党总支书记陈德顺和他一起学习《为人民服务》、《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章。“黄破布”从学习中提高了阶级觉悟，沉痛地检查了自己的忘本思想。他说：“我今天穿上新衣，不能忘掉世界上有多少穷苦弟兄还穿着破布，我一定要革命到底！”从此，他积极领导群众，处处带头，干劲很大。
    通过学习毛主席著作，音西大队党总支健全了三个制度：以宣传毛泽东思想为中心的党课制度；以访贫问苦为重点的联系群众制度；以批评和自我批评为内容的组织生活制度。执行这些制度的结果，使党组织成为毛泽东思想的战斗堡垒，使全大队的干部、党员都能保持旺盛的革命精神，保证了对农民群众的政治领导。
    组织社员群众学习毛主席著作，也落实到思想革命化方面。近一年来，音西大队反复领导社员群众学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，引导他们用张思德、白求恩等人的光辉榜样对照自己的思想行动；并且经常围绕国内外形势和各项中心工作，组织社员学习毛主席的有关著作，讨论种田和革命的关系，大大调动了他们的革命积极性。在讨论制订今年生产计划的时候，许多社员把发展生产同当前国内外斗争形势联系起来。贫农女社员何梅英说：“我们今天过了好日子，不能忘记世界上还有三分之二阶级兄弟没有翻身，越南兄弟姐妹还受美帝国主义的欺侮。当年白求恩不远万里到中国来帮助我们革命，今天我们更应该努力搞好生产，支援世界人民革命。”生产队长郭天顺，曾经有自满松劲情绪，现在却说：“毛主席教导我们，要把革命进行到底。音西今天取得一点点成绩，只是万里长征走完了第一步。革命的路程还远着哩，我们的革命责任还大着哩。”
    为了进一步扫除干部、社员中的自满情绪，这个大队除了派出部分干部、积极分子到附近先进单位取“经”以外，最近又结合学习毛主席著作，组织了两次有意义的群众活动。一次是到群众活学活用毛主席著作很出色的龙田公社二村大队参观。干部、社员们看到二村大队男女老少人人学习毛主席著作，学了就用，个个意气风发，很受感动。党总支书记陈德顺说：“这样学下去，才是铁打的江山！”参观回来后，干部、社员学习毛主席著作成了风气。一次是组织社员群众在本大队参观，叫做“音西人看音西”。社员们边看边议论。他们看到水库、电动抽水机、碾米机、拖拉机以及宽阔的田间大道、星罗棋布的灌溉渠、输电网、蔗林果园、医院、学校时，就纷纷议论这些翻天覆地的变化的由来。他们认识到，如果没有伟大的党和毛主席，没有强大的社会主义国家，单靠音西农民，这些巨大的变化是无论如何不会有的。要建设社会主义新农村，只有继续加紧生产，支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设，支援世界革命，打倒以美国为首的帝国主义。同时，社员们也看到，虽然生产成绩很大，但是还有先进与后进之分，决不是“增产到顶”了。他们商量出许多新的增产门路，增强了不断革命争取新胜利的信心。
    两次参观结束后，音西大队的干部和社员认真地学习了《愚公移山》、《继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风》等文章，革命精神大振，人人动脑筋想办法，形成群众性的献计献策热潮。离村二十里有座荒山可以造林种果树，大队准备组织一支一百三十人的远耕队去开发那座荒山，结果报名要求前往的有三百多人。春耕前，社员们以愚公移山精神，进行高标准的平整土地，把七百多亩耕地原来只有四寸厚的土层加厚到六寸。新修了两条共长十五里的渠道，使二百亩原来只能种旱粮作物的耕地变成水田，改种水稻。社员们还把一条弯曲的渠道改直，扩大了二十亩耕地。为了增加肥料，河泥挖光了，社员们就跑到五六里外的海港去挖海泥。他们还在耕作技术上挖潜力，早稻普遍采用了先进的育秧法，提前了十天插秧，可以避过台风和虫害的威胁；并采用了合理的插秧规格，为大幅度增产创造了条件。这样，音西大队的生产斗争又提高到了一个新的水平。
