    (Xinhua News Agency, June 9th) Brussels Dispatch: The spring meeting of the North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council opened in Brussels on the 7th amidst a deep crisis.

    In order to encourage the allies who were torn apart by France's decision to withdraw from the military "integration" mechanism of the group, US Secretary of State Rusk, in his speech, tried his best to promote the "achievements" of the North Atlantic Group since its establishment. At the same time, he also advocated turning the North Atlantic Group into a tool for bridging with the Soviet Union, suggesting that the group, based on a position of strength, "improve" relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to promote their "peaceful evolution," while injecting new vitality into the moribund North Atlantic Group so that the United States can continue to control its allies.

    According to the US Information Service, Rusk emphasized that the "strength and unity" of the North Atlantic Group allies are the primary conditions for "improving relations" with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, and believes that Moscow is more "cautious" today than in the past as a result of the North Atlantic Group's "position of strength" policy.

    Rusk believes that the US aggression war in Vietnam does not hinder the "easing" of tensions between the US and the Soviet Union on "fundamental issues." He also stated that while pursuing a policy of "improving relations" with the Soviet Union, the United States will never retreat from its position, for example, "never giving up Vietnam and Berlin," and seeking solutions to European issues "based on the Western security perspective."

    He said that maintaining peaceful relations between the West and the Soviet Union is in their common interest. The United States is seeking to advance the policy of concluding consular treaties and expanding East-West trade with the Soviet Union. He said that for the North Atlantic Group, "the important thing is to clearly and unmistakably show that it sincerely hopes to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe."

    Representatives from some countries participating in the meeting agreed to pursue a policy of "peaceful evolution" for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Based on their own interests, they put forward various different proposals for specific practices. Danish Foreign Minister Haekkerup, in response to the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko during his recent visit to Rome to hold a so-called "European Security Conference," proposed a plan to hold a meeting of members of the North Atlantic Group and participants of the Warsaw Treaty. British Foreign Secretary Stewart argued that agreement could be reached to hold a meeting under the following three conditions: the participation of the United States; the issue of "reunification of Germany" should be on the agenda; and non-recognition of the German Democratic Republic, not allowing it to participate in the meeting on an equal footing with other countries.

    The speech by French Foreign Minister De Murville showed that France also wants to make "independence" towards the United States on this issue. He said that France believes that the issue of "East-West détente" "is not an issue for the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty to deal with, but an issue for European countries." He also said that he himself will "help" this "effort" through a series of formal visits to Eastern European countries, and that French President de Gaulle's upcoming trip to the Soviet Union should also be viewed from this perspective.

    West German Foreign Minister Schroeder also does not advocate negotiations between the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty participants.

    At the meeting on the 7th, fierce disputes arose over the status of French troops stationed in West Germany after their withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group's "integrated" command. With the support of Britain and West Germany, the United States attempted to force France at this meeting to accept negotiations on the status of French troops with the five-nation committee established under US orchestration, in order to force France to make concessions with collective pressure. French Foreign Minister De Murville fought back. He said that the status of French troops is not a political issue, and there is no need to negotiate with allies, but should only be handled by France and West Germany, as well as France and the North Atlantic Group military authorities.

    On the 6th, the United States had gathered other allies to hold a fourteen-nation meeting without France's participation, attempting to deal with France at the fifteen-nation council meeting on the 7th with a unanimous resolution. As a result, agreements were only reached on moving the alliance's military headquarters to Brussels, merging the Central European Command, abolishing the US, British, and French Standing Military Committee, and other minor issues.

    (Xinhua News Agency, June 9th) Brussels Dispatch: The communiqué issued after the North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council meeting closed on the 8th shows that after France insisted on withdrawing from the military "integration" mechanism of the group, despite the United States' efforts to inject a stimulant into it, this aggressive group has further disintegrated and declined.

    This meeting was a meeting forced to arrange the aftermath. The meeting communiqué listed some of the aftermath arrangements made by the fourteen countries after France's withdrawal:

    The Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) will be moved from Paris to Brussels, the various institutions of the Central European Command will be merged and moved to West Germany or the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg region, the US, British, and French Military Committee will be abolished, and appropriate arrangements will be made instead, etc. Regarding the contentious issue of the status of French troops stationed in West Germany, the communiqué stated that the Permanent Council will first discuss the "tasks and roles, including their cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces" after the withdrawal of French troops from the "integrated" command. According to news reports, a fierce struggle took place between France and the United States, Britain, and West Germany on this issue. Following the dispute on the 7th, multiple behind-the-scenes meetings were held on the morning and afternoon of the 8th to argue about this issue. The United States originally wanted to negotiate with France through a five-nation committee representing the fourteen countries, creating a situation of fourteen against one, but France finally only agreed to negotiate in the fifteen-nation Permanent Council of which France is a member. At France's insistence, the words "in an emergency" (cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces) were also deleted from the communiqué. France believes that "cooperation" in wartime is a disguised form of "integration," which is unacceptable to France.

    Regarding the issue of the alliance's political headquarters and the seat of the Permanent Council, the United States, with the support of Britain and West Germany, advocated moving the Council out of France as well to put pressure on it, but it was opposed by a majority of the fourteen allies, led by Italy and Canada, and no agreement could be reached. It had to be left to a special meeting in October for further discussion and decision. French Foreign Minister De Murville expressed a tough attitude of letting them go or stay as they pleased. The communiqué noted the deferred proposal of the fourteen countries and De Murville's statement.

    The meeting communiqué devoted considerable space to discussing the need to "improve" relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from a position of strength.

    The communiqué reiterated the continued necessity of maintaining this aggressive alliance for the West, while emphasizing that "the West must maintain sufficient deterrence and defensive power," and "maintain and develop their respective and collective capabilities to resist armed attacks."

    Regarding the so-called "European Security" issue, the communiqué reiterated the North Atlantic Group's December 1958 declaration guaranteeing support for West Berlin, and expressed "regret" that no progress had been made on the "reunification of Germany" (i.e., annexation of the German Democratic Republic). The communiqué referred to the deceptive "peace proposals" put forward by the Bonn government to gain diplomatic initiative as "positive initiatives," reiterated that "the solution of the German question is one of the central issues in East-West relations," and expressed that it would "persistently strive" to achieve "German reunification" and "end the division of Europe" by peaceful means.

    Due to the Soviet revisionist leading group's vigorous pursuit of "détente" with the United States, the communiqué stated that the West can now take the political initiative to "stabilize East-West relations." It said that in this regard, "member states are seeking to further improve relations between the peoples of Eastern and Western Europe, reduce mutual suspicion and fear, and are convinced that further results can be achieved in the cultural, economic, scientific, and technological fields." The ministers have instructed their permanent representatives to "continue to carefully study the prospects for the development of East-West relations and prepare a comprehensive report" to be submitted to the meeting of foreign ministers.

    The communiqué expressed "concern" about progress in so-called supervised comprehensive and thorough disarmament, and the need to "work to solve" the so-called "nuclear proliferation problem."

### 帝国主义阵营矛盾重重加速四分五裂  美国在北大西洋集团理事会上对法国施加压力遭到坚决反击  腊斯克鼓吹加强美苏合作促进苏联东欧“和平演变”

    帝国主义阵营矛盾重重加速四分五裂
    美国在北大西洋集团理事会上对法国施加压力遭到坚决反击
    腊斯克鼓吹加强美苏合作促进苏联东欧“和平演变”
    据新华社九日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：北大西洋集团部长理事会春季会议七日在深重危机下在布鲁塞尔开幕。
    为了给因为法国决定退出这个集团的军事“一体化”机构而四分五裂的盟国打气，美国国务卿腊斯克在发言中竭力鼓吹北大西洋集团成立以来的
  “成就”。同时，他还鼓吹把北大西洋集团变为同苏联搭桥的工具，建议这个集团从实力地位出发，同苏联东欧国家“改善”关系，以促进它们的“和平演变”，同时给奄奄一息的北大西洋集团注入新的活力，使美国可以继续控制它的盟国。
    据美国新闻处报道，腊斯克强调，北大西洋集团盟国的“力量和团结”是同苏联东欧国家“改善关系”的首要条件，并且认为莫斯科今天比过去“谨慎”是北大西洋集团“实力地位”政策的结果。
    腊斯克认为，美国在越南进行侵略战争并不妨碍美苏之间在“基本问题”上实现“缓和”。他还表示，在推行和苏联
  “改善关系”政策的同时，美国决不从自己的立场后退，例如，“决不放弃越南和柏林”，要
  “根据西方安全的观点”谋求欧洲问题的解决办法。
    他说，西方同苏联保持和平关系是符合它们的共同利益的。美国正在设法推进同苏联缔结领事条约和扩大东西方贸易的政策。他说，对北大西洋集团来说，“重要的事情是明确无误地表明它认真希望同苏联东欧改善关系”。
    参加会议的一些国家的代表都赞成推行使苏联和东欧“和平演变”的政策。他们从本国的利益出发，对具体作法提出了各种不同的主张。丹麦外交大臣海克鲁普针对苏联外交部长葛罗米柯不久前访问罗马时提出的举行所谓“欧洲安全会议”的建议，提出了举行北大西洋集团成员国和华沙条约参加国会议的计划。英国外交大臣斯图尔特则主张，在实现下列三个条件下，可以同意举行会议，这三个条件是：有美国参加；“重新统一德国”问题应列入议程；不承认德意志民主共和国，不让它在同其他国家平等的基础上参加会议。
    法国外交部长德姆维尔的讲话表明，法国在这个问题上也要向美国闹“独立”。他说，法国认为，“东西方缓和”的问题“不是华沙条约和北大西洋条约处理的一个问题，而是欧洲各国的事情。”他还说，他本人将通过对东欧各国的一系列正式访问来“帮助”这种“努力”，对于法国总统戴高乐不久的苏联之行，也应从这个角度去看。
    西德外交部长施罗德也不主张北大西洋集团同华沙条约参加国谈判。
    在七日的会议上，在驻西德法军退出北大西洋集团“一体化”司令部以后的地位问题上发生了激烈的争吵。美国在英国和西德支持下，企图在这次会议上迫使法国接受同在美国策划下成立的五国委员会谈判法军地位问题，以便用集体压力逼使法国让步。法国外长德姆维尔进行了反击。他说，法军地位问题不是一个政治性问题，毋需与盟国谈判，只应该由法国和西德双方以及法国和北大西洋集团军事当局处理。
    六日，美国曾纠合其他盟国举行没有法国参加的十四国会议，企图通过一致的决议到七日的十五国理事会上来对付法国。结果，只是在把联盟军事总部迁往布鲁塞尔、合并中欧司令部、取消美、英、法三国常设军事委员会以及其他次要问题上达成了协议。
    新华社九日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：北大西洋集团部长理事会会议在八日闭幕后发表的公报表明，在法国坚持退出这个集团的军事“一体化”机构以后，尽管美国力图给它注射强心针，但是，这个侵略集团已进一步四分五裂和衰落。
    这次会议是被迫安排后事的会议，会议公报列举了十四国在法国退出后作出的一些善后安排：
    驻欧盟军最高司令部从巴黎迁往布鲁塞尔，中欧司令部各机构合并迁往西德或荷、比、卢地区，取消美、英、法三国军事委员会，代之以适当的安排等。关于争执不休的驻西德法军地位问题，公报说，将先由常设理事会讨论法军退出“一体化”司令部以后的“任务和作用、包括他们和北大西洋公约组织部队的合作”。据消息报道，在这个问题上，法国和美、英、西德之间发生了激烈的斗争。继七日的争吵后，八日上午和下午又举行了多次幕后会议争论这个问题。美国原想通过一个五国委员会代表十四国来同法国谈判，造成十四对一的局面，法国最后只同意在法国作为一个成员的十五国常设理事会中谈判。在法国的坚持下，还从公报中删除了“在紧急状态下”（和北大西洋公约组织部队合作）的字样。法国认为，在战时的“合作”就是变相的“一体化”，是法国所不能接受的。
    关于联盟的政治总部、常设理事会会址问题，美国在英国和西德支持下，主张把理事会也迁出法国，对它施加压力，但是，遭到十四盟国中以意大利、加拿大为首的多数国家的反对，未能达成协议，只好留待十月份的特别会议上再讨论决定。法国外长德姆维尔对此表示了去留听便的强硬态度。公报表示注意到了十四国的延期建议和德姆维尔的声明。
    会议公报以相当大的篇幅谈到要从实力地位出发来同苏联东欧“改善”关系。
    公报重申继续保持这个侵略联盟对西方的必要性，同时强调“西方必须保持足够的威慑和防御力量”，“维持和发展各自和集体的抵抗武装进攻的能力”。
    关于所谓“欧洲安全”问题，公报重申北大西洋集团一九五八年十二月保证支持西柏林的宣言，对“德国重新统一”（即吞并德意志民主共和国）没有取得进展感到“遗憾”。公报把波恩政府为争取外交主动而提出的欺骗性“和平建议”称为“积极的倡议”，重申“德国问题的解决是东西方关系中的中心问题之一”，并且表示要“坚持不懈地努力”用和平方式来实现“德国重新统一”和“结束欧洲分裂状态”。
    由于苏联修正主义领导集团同美国大搞“缓和”，公报说，西方现在可以采取政治上的主动来“稳定东西方关系”。它说，在这方面，“成员国正在设法进一步改进东西欧人民之间的关系，减少相互猜疑和恐惧，并且深信，可以在文化、经济、科学和技术方面取得进一步的结果”。各国部长们已指示他们的常任代表“继续仔细研究东西方关系发展的前景，并且准备一份全面的报告”，提交外长会议。
    公报表示“关切”在所谓有监督的全面彻底裁军方面取得进展，并且要“努力解决”所谓“核扩散问题”。
