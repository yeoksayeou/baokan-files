    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 9th: Arishige Otsuka, Chairman of the Osaka Prefecture Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, emphasized at a reception on the evening of the 8th to welcome the Chinese Guangdong Friendship Delegation led by Tseng Sheng, that it is necessary to learn from Chairman Mao Zedong's experience in running the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangdong, which cultivated many people's revolutionaries against imperialism.

    Tseng Sheng said in his speech that the Japanese people's heroic struggle against the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka is a support and encouragement to the Chinese people and the people of the world in their struggle against American imperialism.

    Otsuka said in his speech at the reception that the vast majority of the Japanese people hope to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations as soon as possible, but a part of Japanese monopoly capitalists and the Sato government maintain a very close relationship with the paper tiger of American imperialism. Otsuka expressed the hope that the Japanese people would overthrow this paper tiger as soon as possible.

    Head of the delegation Tseng Sheng said in his speech that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka is a support to the Chinese people and an encouragement to the people of the world. Tseng Sheng concluded by saying, let us form a broad and powerful united front against American imperialism and its running dogs and modern revisionism, and strive to defend Asian and world peace.

    The welcoming reception was jointly organized by the Japan-China Friendship Association Osaka Prefecture Federation, the Kansai Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association Kansai Headquarters, and the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association Kansai Branch.

    The Chinese Guangdong Friendship Delegation held a farewell reception in Nagoya City at noon on the 8th to thank people from all walks of life in Aichi, Mie, and Gifu prefectures in the Tokai region of Japan for their warm welcome and reception to the delegation.

    Nearly one hundred representatives from all walks of life in these three prefectures and representatives of Korean residents in Japan attended the reception.

    Tseng Sheng said in his speech at the reception that any reactionary attempting to obstruct and undermine Sino-Japanese friendship is engaging in futile efforts. Constantly enhancing the militant friendship between the people of China and Japan in the common struggle against American imperialism is of profound significance for defending Asian and world peace.

    Tseng Sheng praised the Japanese people for their heroic struggle to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, strengthen the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan, and oppose the American imperialist policy of "containing" China.

    Representatives of the Aichi Prefecture and Mie Prefecture welcoming delegation committees also spoke at the reception, expressing their determination to work for further strengthening the friendship between the people of Japan and China.

    据新华社东京九日电　日中友好协会大阪府联合会理事长大塚有章在八日晚上欢迎由曾生率领的中国广东省友好代表团的酒会上讲话时，强调要学习毛泽东主席在广东举办农民运动讲习所培养了很多反对帝国主义的人民革命家的经验。
    曾生在讲话中说，日本人民反对美国核潜艇开进横须贺的英勇斗争，是对中国人民和世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的支持和鼓舞。
    大塚在酒会上致词说，绝大多数的日本人民都希望早日恢复日中邦交，但是，一部分日本垄断资本家和佐藤政府同美帝国主义这个纸老虎保持着十分密切的关系。大塚表示日本人民希望早日打倒这个纸老虎。
    曾生团长在讲话中说，日本人民反对美国核潜艇开进横须贺的英勇斗争，是对中国人民的一个支持，也是对世界人民的一个鼓舞。曾生最后说，让我们结成反对美帝国主义及其走狗和现代修正主义的广泛的强有力的统一战线，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争。
