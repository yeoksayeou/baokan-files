    Overthrow the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist "Authorities"
    Wang Yonggui, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Worker at Changgouyu Coal Mine, Jingxi Mining Bureau
    The articles by Comrades Zhuang Jiafu and Zhou Xinli are excellent examples of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. However, certain so-called "authorities" have criticized these articles as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism." This is a malicious attack on our creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works. We must expose their conspiracy.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest instruction for all our work, the most powerful weapon guiding our revolutionary cause, and a universal truth applicable everywhere. We revolutionaries must study it and can all put it to good use. Playing ball and selling melons are both specific revolutionary tasks. Is using revolutionary theory to guide specific revolutionary work "vulgarization" or "pragmatism"? Chairman Mao said: "As for the theory of Marxism, it is necessary to be proficient in it and apply it. The purpose of being proficient is entirely for the sake of application. If you can apply the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to explain one or two practical problems, you should be praised, and it counts as having made some achievements. The more you explain, the more universal, and the more profound your explanation is, the greater your achievement will be." In studying Chairman Mao's works, we must adhere to the principle of combining study with application, and creatively study and apply them, making great efforts in "application" to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and achieve immediate and effective results. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu and other comrades from the national table tennis team, precisely based on the principle of creative study and application, used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the contradictions in their work, applied Chairman Mao's strategic thinking to playing ball, and enabled the Chinese table tennis team to win victory after victory in international competitions. Comrade Zhou Xinli used Chairman Mao's philosophical thought to solve the contradictions in selling melons, and used the method of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one, fighting a good battle in selling watermelons.
    These two articles are both good articles and good examples of using Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems. They powerfully illustrate that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can be transformed into a tremendous material force. Why do certain "authorities" insist on criticizing such good articles as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism"? Why do they so viciously attack our creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works? This can only show that they fear Mao Zedong Thought, oppose the broad masses studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and fear turning philosophy into a sharp weapon in the hands of the masses. They know that once the masses grasp the truth, they will rise up in revolution, break through the nets of all old forces and old ideas, sweep away the evil fog spread by all the monsters and demons, break their academic monopoly, and make it difficult for those "authorities" who use book knowledge as capital and vainly attempt to transform the world with a bourgeois worldview to achieve their goal of capitalist restoration. We want to warn these "authorities" that your wishful thinking will not succeed, and your conspiracy will never succeed. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light, and we workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot leave Mao Zedong Thought for a moment.
    I am a coal mine machinery repair worker. In recent years, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I have understood that repairing machines is doing revolution, building socialism, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," established a responsible and meticulous work attitude, repaired machines meticulously, and insisted on quality first. By studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," we have figured out the temperament of the machines, found the main contradictions in our work, and initially grasped the laws of repair work, turning work from passive to active. Not only have we overfulfilled the repair tasks every month, but we have also broken superstitions, broken frameworks, stepped out of the circle of repair work, carried out more than 20 innovations on the rock loaders, improved the performance of the machines, and promoted production. In the past, I was also active and busy at work, but I was always fighting a passive battle, and I couldn't exert my strength. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized the particularity of the rock loader, found the laws of repair work, and recognized the dialectical relationship between good and fast, repair and innovation, and learning and creation. I connected the seemingly small and trivial repair work with the great revolutionary cause, so that I am "in the repair team, but with my eyes on the whole world."
    Several years of study have made me deeply realize that without Mao Zedong Thought, my class consciousness would not be raised, and I would not dare to do or think in my work. Chairman Mao's books have given me a backbone, made my mind clear, and made me full of energy. Certain "authorities" vainly attempt to use the big stick of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" to oppose our creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, trying to turn back the wheels of history. This is absolutely impossible. I want to warn you bourgeois "authorities" that the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have learned to observe all things with the viewpoint of class struggle and the method of class analysis. We have clearly seen that the essence of your opposition to studying Chairman Mao's works is to oppose the soul guiding the revolutionary struggle—Mao Zedong Thought—and to oppose the Party and the socialist revolution. I will definitely fight you to the end together with the broad revolutionary people.

    打倒反党反社会主义的“权威”
    全国人民代表大会代表  京西矿务局长沟峪煤矿工人  王永贵
    庄家富和周信礼两位同志的文章，是活学活用毛主席著作的好文章，而某些所谓“权威”却指责这两篇文章是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。这是对我们活学活用毛主席著作的恶毒攻击。我们必须揭穿他们的阴谋。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是我们各项工作的最高指示，是指导革命事业的最有威力的武器，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。我们闹革命的人都要学，也都能用得上。打球、卖瓜都是具体的革命工作，用革命理论指导具体的革命工作，能叫“庸俗化”和“实用主义”吗？毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。被你说明的东西越多，越普遍，越深刻，你的成绩就越大。”我们学习毛主席著作，就要坚持学用结合、活学活用的原则，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能把毛泽东思想学到手，才能立竿见影，收到成效。庄家富同志和国家乒乓球队的其他同志，正是本着活学活用的原则，运用毛泽东思想分析了自己工作中的矛盾，把毛主席的战略思想用到打球上，使中国乒乓球队在国际比赛中赢得了一次又一次的胜利。周信礼同志运用毛主席的哲学思想解决了卖瓜工作中的矛盾，运用集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的方法，打好了卖西瓜这一仗。
    这两篇文章都是用毛泽东思想解决实际问题的好文章，好典型。它有力地说明，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就能变成巨大的物质力量。为什么某些“权威”却偏偏要把这样的好文章指责为“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型呢？为什么这样恶毒攻击我们活学活用毛主席著作呢？这只能说明他们害怕毛泽东思想，反对广大群众学习和掌握毛泽东思想，害怕把哲学变成群众手中的尖锐武器。他们知道，群众掌握了真理，就要起来革命，就要冲破一切旧势力、旧思想的罗网，扫清一切牛鬼蛇神散布的妖雾，就要打破他们的学术垄断，就会使那些用书本知识作本钱，妄想用资产阶级世界观来改造世界的“权威”，难以达到复辟资本主义的目的。我们要警告这些“权威”，你们的妄想办不到，你们的阴谋休想得逞，毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯，我们工农兵一时一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。
    我是个煤矿机械检修工人。近几年来，我在毛泽东思想的哺育下，懂得了检修机器就是干革命，就是建设社会主义，就是支援全世界人民的革命斗争。我学习了《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》，树立了认真负责、精益求精的工作态度，检修机器一丝不苟，坚持了质量第一。学习了《矛盾论》、《实践论》，我们摸到了机器的脾气，找到了工作中的主要矛盾，初步掌握了检修工作的规律，使工作从被动变为主动，不但月月超额完成了检修任务，而且破除迷信，打破框框，跳出了检修工作的圈子，对装岩机进行了二十多项革新，改进了机器的性能，促进了生产。过去，我工作也积极，也很忙，但是老打被动仗，有劲儿也使不上，学了毛主席著作，我才认识到装岩机这种机器的特殊性，才找到检修工作的规律，才认识了好和快、检修和革新、学习和创造的辩证关系，把看来细小琐碎的检修工作和伟大的革命事业联系起来，才使我“身在检修班，放眼全世界”。
    几年来的学习，使我深深地体会到，没有毛泽东思想，我的阶级觉悟就提不高，在工作上就不敢干，也不敢想。毛主席的书，使我有了主心骨，心明眼亮，干劲足了。某些“权威”妄想用“庸俗化”、
  “实用主义”的大棒来反对我们活学活用毛主席著作，企图使历史的车轮倒转，这绝对办不到。我要警告你们这些资产阶级“权威”们，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，已经学会了用阶级斗争的观点和阶级分析的方法来观察一切事物，我们已经看清楚了你们反对学习毛主席著作的实质，就是反对指导革命斗争的灵魂——毛泽东思想，就是反对党，反对社会主义革命。我一定要和广大革命人民一起，和你们斗争到底。
