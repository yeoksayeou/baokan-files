    When Comrade Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu and others, stepped out of the cabin, the welcoming crowd waiting at the airport waved Chinese and Romanian national flags and roses, and the cheers echoed through the sky for a long time.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai shook hands with the party and government leaders of Dobrogea州waiting to greet them. An old man, according to the custom of welcoming close guests, wore national costumes and held bread and salt with both hands to welcome the head of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation. Young women presented bouquets to Comrade Zhou Enlai and delegation members Zhao Yimin, Qiao Guanhua, and Zeng Yongquan.

    When Comrade Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu, traveled in an open car from the airport to Constanța City, residents of villages and towns along the 25-kilometer road came to the roadside with flowers and Chinese and Romanian national flags to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu and others, visited Constanța's coastal area, the Archaeological Museum, and the port. When the open car carrying Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu drove through the streets, men, women, and children in the city, as well as people recuperating at the coast, flocked to the streets to warmly welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai.

    At noon on the 19th, the Dobrogea州 Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and the Executive Committee of the州People's Council hosted a luncheon to entertain Comrade Zhou Enlai and other Chinese guests.

    In his speech, Comrade Zhou Enlai first extended his heartfelt greetings to the entire people of Constanța City and Dobrogea州.
