Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to break the technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie

Tianjin workers produce a large number of high-quality, high-level new products

The successful trials of many new products vividly prove: only when people's thoughts are revolutionized, will there be a revolution in technology and products; workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and bravest, and any miracle in the world can be created in their hands.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 26th: Workers in Tianjin City, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and produced a large number of high-quality, high-level new products. In the first five months of this year, they successfully trialed and passed the appraisal of 480 new products, which is 27% more than the same period last year.

Once the working masses grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought,

They can transform spiritual power into tremendous material power.

The appearance of a large number of new products in Tianjin City shows that once the working masses grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they can greatly change their spiritual outlook and transform spiritual power into tremendous material power. When workers talk to reporters about how they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to dare to forge ahead, dare to innovate, charge into the battle, and climb the technical peak, their feelings are very excited. They said: Those bourgeois "authorities" slander our study of Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism." Let them open their blind eyes and see the facts!

Many successful examples of new product trials vividly prove a timeless truth: only when people's thoughts are revolutionized, will there be a revolution in technology and products; only workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and bravest, and any miracle in the world can be created in their hands.

Half a year ago, the Wire Rope Factory of Tianjin Steel Plant accepted a task to trial-produce conical steel wire ropes. This type of steel wire rope has different diameters and must form a conical shape. Obviously, for workers who manufacture steel wire ropes, accepting this task has many special difficulties. Faced with difficulties, should they shirk responsibilities and pass the heavy burden to others, or should they take the initiative to shoulder the heavy burden? They reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Hard work is like a burden in front of us, see if we dare to bear it." "Chairman Mao said so, we do so," the workers said without hesitation and bravely took on the heavy burden.

To trial-produce this new product, there was no technical data and no operational experience. What to do? They found inspiration in "On Practice." Chairman Mao said, "Knowledge begins with practice," "All true knowledge originates from direct experience." To explore the revolutionary path, they organized a team to attack the technical difficulties. They used Chairman Mao's works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and "On Practice" as weapons to break through technical difficulties, insisting on learning and applying them actively. They resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, fearing neither hardship nor difficulty, daring to think and act, working hard and steadily, finding experience from practice, creating experience from practice, breaking the bourgeois "authorities'" rules and regulations, breaking the foreign frameworks and foreign dogmas, and in just twenty days, they found their own way to formally trial-produce this type of steel wire rope. Then, the factory's party organization selected a group of politically red and technically skilled workers and technicians to form the trial-production team, which began the trial production. They carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao," treated the workshop as a battlefield, treated difficulties as enemies, and with an indomitable and unconquerable heroic spirit, quickly, efficiently, and economically produced first-class conical steel wire ropes.

To quickly, efficiently, and economically develop new products,

In scientific experiments, the key is to break first.

Is the trial production of new products dependent on a few so-called "experts" and "authorities," following foreign frameworks and routines, coldly and slowly? Or is it following Chairman Mao's instructions, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, and carrying out a revolutionary mass movement? This is a struggle between two ideologies and two paths in the field of technology, and it is also the key to whether scientific experiments can be quickly, efficiently, and economically conducted.

Last year, Tianjin Machine Tool Factory successfully trial-produced a cylindrical bed horizontal spindle surface grinder, which took three years to complete because it only relied on a few engineering and technical personnel and followed a set of foreign frameworks and dogmas. At the beginning of this year, the workers of this factory, in the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, liberated their minds, broke superstitions, and actively accepted the task of manufacturing a more complex vertical spindle matrix table electrolytic surface grinder. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, fully exerted their wisdom, and as a result, only took 88 days to successfully trial-produce it. This grinder, which uses new electrolytic technology to process high-strength hard alloy parts, is currently only produced by a few countries in the world.

Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Workers realized from practice that to quickly, efficiently, and economically develop new products, scientific experiments must start with breaking. They first visited more than 20 users in Shanghai, Beijing, Harbin, and Tianjin to solicit opinions and understand needs. Then, the factory's workers, technicians, scientific research units, and users jointly organized a design team, concentrated the wisdom of the masses, and widely practiced technical democracy. In just 28 days, they completed the product design. After the design drawings were democratically discussed and decided, they were handed over to the "frontline command department" composed of old workers Xu Guoxiang, Chi Yushu, and Wang Fengming. As a result, in just four days, they completed all 600-plus sheets of process documents. Because workers participated in the design and formulated process documents, this precise grinder not only succeeded in the first trial production but also passed the national appraisal, with precision and smoothness exceeding the specified standards.

Tianjin Machine Tool Factory's use of such a short time to design and manufacture such a high-level machine tool new product is a pioneering achievement in Tianjin's machine tool manufacturing industry.

The great power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless

Small factories and communes produce high-level new products.

Many new products with the level of the 1960s have been born in small factories and communes that were once looked down upon by some "experts" and "authorities." This is a great joy on Tianjin's industrial front this year, which once again demonstrates the power of Mao Zedong Thought, the power of highlighting politics, and the power of revolutionizing people's thoughts.

More than 100 small factories and communes under the Tianjin Second Light Industry Bureau have now become a new force in the trial production of high-level precision new products. With the help of relevant units, they dare to think and act, study hard, innovate boldly, and create miracle after miracle. The walnut kernel selection cooperative produced semiconductor diodes; the straw rope cooperative produced high and low-temperature automatic alarm devices; the small commune that manufactures ordinary glass instruments produced precision micro-injection devices.

The workers of these small factories and communes, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, are full of vigor, dare to challenge the bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" who believe in foreign frameworks and dogmas, and march towards new realms and heights of science and technology.

Not long ago, a small factory under the Tianjin Daily Use Miscellaneous Goods Company—Comprehensive Factory Six—could only produce ordinary glass instruments. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, four young workers of this factory took only more than a month to successfully trial-produce polarizing films, an important product widely needed in the glass, textile, petroleum, and instrument industries, filling a gap in Tianjin's industry.

The young worker who undertook the trial production of this precision new product was a 19-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, Dian Lijuan, who had only completed primary school. When she went to Beijing to attend a professional conference for the trial production of this new product, polarizing films were completely unfamiliar to her. She brought "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a notebook to Beijing. Every day, she studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" eagerly and diligently learned about polarizing films. According to foreign methods, the production of polarizing films requires high-level precision equipment, and the production workshop must be as clean as a large hospital's operating room. Dian Lijuan and her comrades-in-arms—three young demobilized soldiers—did not believe in this. They brought questions, studied Chairman Mao's works, and greatly boosted their revolutionary spirit. Chairman Mao said: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they do not avoid problems but solve them actively, any difficulty in the world can be overcome." They did as Chairman Mao said. The four young people faced difficulties and actively used their brains. They cleaned a small warehouse of only 18 square meters and simply set up a small production workshop free of dust. They made the main equipment, the film-pulling machine, out of wooden boards. They learned while doing, summed up experiences while doing, and finally produced blue, transparent, and evenly colored polarizing films.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想大破资产阶级技术“权威”
    天津工人制成大批高质量高水平新产品
    许多新产品的试制成功生动地证明：只有人的思想革命化，才会有技术的革命，产品的革命；用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，最聪明，最勇敢，任何人间奇迹在他们手里都能创造出来
    据新华社天津二十六日电　用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的天津市广大职工，解放思想，破除迷信，又制成了大批高质量高水平的新产品。在今年的头五个月里，他们试制成功并且经过鉴定合格的新产品共有四百八十多种，比去年上半年还多百分之二十七以上。
    工人群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想
    能使精神力量转化为巨大物质力量
    天津市大批新产品的出现表明，工人群众一旦掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就能极大地改变自己的精神面貌，就能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。工人们在向记者谈到他们以毛泽东思想为武器，敢闯敢创，冲锋陷阵，攀登技术高峰的时候，心情十分激动。他们说：那些资产阶级“权威”们诬蔑我们学习毛主席著作是什么“庸俗化”、“简单化”，是什么“实用主义”，让他们睁开瞎眼看看事实吧！
    许多新产品试制成功的事例，生动地证明了这样一个颠扑不破的真理：只有人的思想革命化，才会有技术的革命，产品的革命；用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人才是最聪明，最勇敢，任何人间的奇迹在他们的手里都能创造出来。
    天津钢厂丝绳分厂在半年前接受了一项试制锥形钢丝绳的任务。这种钢丝绳，直径要求不一，而且必须形成锥形。显而易见，对于制造钢丝绳的工人们来说，接受这项任务，是有着许多特殊困难的。在困难面前，是拈轻怕重，把重担推给别人，还是自己主动地挑重担？他们重温了毛主席的教导：“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”“毛主席怎么说的，我们就怎么做”，工人们二话没说，勇敢地挑起了重担子。
    试制这种新产品，一没有技术资料，二没有操作经验，怎么办？他们从《实践论》中得到了启示。毛主席说，“认识从实践始”，“一切真知都是从直接经验发源的”。为了探索出革命的道路，组织了试验钢丝绳新产品的攻关队。他们以毛主席著作《为人民服务》《愚公移山》和《实践论》作为攻克技术难关的武器，坚持活学活用。他们坚决按毛主席的指示办事，不怕苦，不怕难，敢想敢干，踏踏实实，从实践中找经验，从实践中创造经验，大破资产阶级“权威”的清规戒律，大破洋框框和洋教条，只用了二十天就为正式试制这种钢丝绳摸索出了一条自己的路子。接着，工厂的党组织又选拔出一批思想红、技术精的工人和技术人员，组成试制队伍，开始了试制。他们带着《毛主席语录》，把车间当做战场，把困难当做敌人，以无坚不摧、无攻不克的英雄气概，多快好省地制造出了第一流的锥形钢丝绳。
    要多快好省地发展新产品  在科学实验中必须破字当头
    试制新产品，是依靠少数所谓“专家”，“权威”，按照洋框框的常规，冷冷清清、慢慢腾腾地搞，还是遵照毛主席的教导，充分发动和依靠群众，大搞革命的群众运动？这是在技术领域里的两种思想、两条道路的斗争，也是科学实验能不能作到多快好省的关键所在。
    天津市机床厂去年试制成功的圆台卧轴平面磨床，由于只是依靠少数工程技术人员，按照一套洋框框洋教条，整整搞了三年才成功。今年初，这个厂的职工在大学毛主席著作的高潮中，解放思想，破除迷信，主动地接受了制造更为复杂的立轴矩台电解平面磨床的任务。他们遵照毛主席的教导，充分发挥自己的聪明才智，结果只用八十八天就试制成功了。这种应用电解新技术加工高强度硬质合金件的磨床，目前在世界上也只有极少数国家能够制造。
    毛主席说：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。工人们从实践中认识到，要多快好省地发展新产品，在科学实验中就必须破字当头。他们首先访问了上海、北京、哈尔滨和天津的二十多家用户，征求意见，了解需要，然后由工厂的工人、技术人员和科学研究单位、用户等联合组织了设计组，集中群众的智慧，广泛发扬技术民主，只用了二十八天就完成了产品的设计。设计图纸经过民主讨论定案以后，交给了由老工人徐国祥、迟玉书、王凤鸣组成的“前线指挥部”，结果在四天之内就完成了六百多张图纸的全部工艺文件。由于工人参加了设计，并且制定了工艺文件，这台精密的磨床不但一次试制成功，而且经过国家鉴定，精度和光洁度都超过了规定的标准。
    天津市机床厂用这样短的时间就设计制造出如此高级的机床新产品，在天津机床制造工业中还是一个创举。
    伟大的毛泽东思想威力无穷  小厂小社制出高水平的新产品
    许多具有六十年代水平的新产品，接连诞生在过去被一些“专家”、“权威”看不起的小厂小社里，这是今年天津工业战线上出现的大喜事，从而再次显示了毛泽东思想的威力，突出政治的威力，人的思想革命化的威力。
    天津市第二轻工业局所属的一百多个小厂小社，现在已成为试制高级精密新产品的一支生力军。他们在有关单位的帮助下，敢想敢干，勤学苦练，学中有创，大胆革新，创造了一个又一个的奇迹。挑选核桃仁的土产挑选社，制成了半导体两极管；草绳社制成了高低温自动警报器；制造普通玻璃仪器的小社，制成了精密微量注射器。
    这些小厂小社的职工，他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，活学活用毛主席著作，意气风发，敢于向迷信洋框框、洋教条的资产阶级“权威”、“专家”挑战，向科学技术的新领域、新高峰进军。
    天津日用杂品公司的一个小厂——综合六厂，不久前还只能生产普通的玻璃仪器。这个厂的四个青年工人，在毛泽东思想指引下，只用一个多月时间，就试制成功了玻璃、纺织、石油、仪器仪表等工业行业广泛需要的重要产品偏振片，为天津工业填补了一项空白。
    承担这项精密新产品试制重担的，是一个十九岁的共青团员、只有高小文化程度的女工田丽娟。当她为试制这项新产品而去北京参加专业会议的时候，偏振片对她来说，还是完全陌生的。她带着《毛主席语录》和一个笔记本来到北京。每天，她如饥似渴地学习毛主席语录，同时勤奋地学习有关偏振片的知识。按照洋办法，生产偏振片必须有高级精密的设备，而且生产车间要象大型医院的手术室一样，一尘不染。田丽娟和她的战友——三个青年转业军人，并没有迷信这一套。他们带着问题，学习了毛主席有关著作，大长革命志气。毛主席说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。四个年轻人面对困难，积极开动脑筋。他们把一间只有十八平方米的小仓库打扫干净，因陋就简地布置了一个不落尘埃的小生产车间，用木板制成了主要设备拉膜机。他们在干中学，边干边学，不断地总结经验，终于制成了厚薄、色泽均匀的蓝色透明的偏振片。
