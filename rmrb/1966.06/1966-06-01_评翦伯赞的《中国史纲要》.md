Edition: 3

    In 1960 to 1962, when our country encountered temporary economic difficulties, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries launched an anti-China chorus. The overthrown class enemies at home also thought their "spring" had arrived, and they crawled out of the gutters one after another, launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism.
    It was at this time that Jian Bozan raised the black flag of anti-Party and anti-socialism, put forward a whole set of reactionary historical theories, and openly challenged the lifeblood of our Party and socialism—Mao Zedong Thought.
    Jian Bozan was extremely hostile to the socialist cultural revolution. Since 1958, in some universities and research institutions, revolutionary history workers, under the leadership of the Party and guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have organized themselves to compile teaching materials and rewrite history. In this process, Jian Bozan published an article entitled "Learning from Sima Guang's Spirit in Compiling 'Zizhi Tongjian'" (People's Daily, June 18, 1961), using Sima Guang's ghost to attack the history revolution, and slandered the collective book writing under the leadership of the Party as "impetuous and hasty" and a "blitzkrieg method." He put forward an anti-Party organizational line, advocating that "to do a good job in the collective writing of history," every book "should have a Sima Guang," that is, there should be a person like Sima Guang who is both a political "opposition" and a so-called "expert" to act as "editor-in-chief," and independently invite "friends with specialized research and like-minded" to cooperate.
    In order to implement his reactionary historical theory, Jian Bozan, posing as Sima Guang, invited several "like-minded" friends and so-called "scholars," and began to write "A General History of China."
    In December 1961, while "A General History of China" was being written, Jian Bozan could not wait to throw out his guiding principles for this book—an article entitled "Preliminary Opinions on Handling Several Historical Issues" (Guangming Daily, December 22, 1961). He posed as a "master," pretending to use his anti-Marxist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought historical theory to confront revolutionary history workers.
    In early 1962, Jian Bozan excitedly took his group of "like-minded friends" to Suzhou, "personally" starting to revise "A General History of China." In October of that year, he published another article entitled "Several Problems Existing in Current Historical Research" (Jianghai Academic Journal, No. 6, 1962), using vicious language to attack Mao Zedong Thought, attack the proletariat's theory of class struggle, oppose historical research serving proletarian politics, vigorously beautify feudal emperors, generals, and ministers, and advocate the modern revisionist "historicism."
    Now, the second, third, and fourth volumes of "A General History of China" have been published successively. Here, we will analyze the contents of the second and third volumes to see what Jian Bozan is selling in this book and what his purpose is in eagerly writing this book.
    Denigrating Peasant Revolutions, Advocating Class Reconciliation
    Chairman Mao said: "The main contradiction in feudal society is the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class." "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to launch many uprisings to resist the rule of the landlord class." "In Chinese feudal society, only this class struggle of the peasants, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the real driving force of historical development." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume II, p. 619)
    Chairman Mao's scientific judgment is the basic clue for our study of the history of Chinese feudal society. The guiding ideology running through "A General History of China" is completely opposed to Chairman Mao's instructions. This book denies that the contradiction between peasants and landlords is the main contradiction throughout feudal society, uglifies revolutionary peasants, obliterates the revolutionary nature of peasant uprisings, and negates the great historical role of peasant uprisings in promoting the development of feudal society.
    Jian Bozan said in "Preliminary Opinions on Handling Several Historical Issues" that the main contradictions in feudal society "are sometimes contradictions between antagonistic classes, sometimes contradictions within the ruling class, and sometimes contradictions between nationalities. Do not say that the main contradictions in any historical period are contradictions between antagonistic classes." According to this principle, "A General History of China" regards many internal contradictions of the ruling class as the main contradictions, writing about them at length, while placing the class contradictions of the time in a subordinate position to the internal contradictions of the ruling class. For example, the book says that after the Yi Province Yellow Turbans were suppressed, "the contradictions between various groups of the landlord class gradually rose up in the Yi Province area, just like in the Central Plains." (Volume II, p. 15) "The Outline" even described the peasants as "allies" of the ruling class in their struggle for power and profit. For example, in describing the uprisings of Jiangnan landlords against the Sui Dynasty in the early Sui Dynasty, it wrote: "Because the powerful landlords did not receive the support of the vast number of peasants, the turmoil was quickly suppressed." When talking about Xu Jingye and the Tang imperial clan princes' uprising against Wu Zetian, it said: "Because they did not receive the support of landlords (note: refers to middle and small landlords) and the people in various places, these two turmoils quickly ended in failure." (Volume II, pp. 145, 167) This is simply absurd! The peasant class and the landlord class are two fundamentally opposed classes. How could peasants become "supporters" of one side in the struggle for power and profit within the landlord class!
    "A General History of China" believes that the cause of peasant uprisings is not the cruel exploitation and oppression of the feudal system, but rather the destruction of the feudal system. For example, when talking about the peasant uprisings in the late Northern Wei Dynasty, "The Outline" wrote: "The system of equal land was quickly destroyed," "The sale of good people into slavery was no longer subject to legal restrictions," so "peasants with no way out rose up in riots." (Volume II, p. 66) The uprising led by peasants Wu Yi and Dong Yi in Chenzhou during the Later Liang Dynasty was due to "Zhu You, a relative of the Later Liang emperor, served as the prefect of Chenzhou, 'relied on the favor of his relatives, and often acted illegally.'" (Middle Volume, p. 2)
    That is to say, the cause of peasant uprisings is the destruction of the feudal exploitation order of the landlord class, and because the peasants cannot get the protection of the feudal kingship. According to this absurd argument, peasant uprisings have become a struggle to maintain feudal kingship and maintain the feudal exploitation order! Jian Bozan uses this method to implement his reactionary theory that peasants do not "oppose feudalism as a system."
    When "The Outline" talked about the late Ming Dynasty peasant uprising led by Li Zicheng, it said that there were three different ideas within the leadership group of the peasant army: one was the "roving bandit ideology" of "no political vision" represented by Liu Zongmin and others, another was the "bureaucrat-landlord ideology" represented by Niu Jinxing and others, and the third was the idea of Li Yan, who hoped to "quickly establish a new feudal order," while Li Zicheng himself was said to be "determined to overthrow the Ming Dynasty in order to achieve the emperor's cause" (Middle Volume, pp. 243-247).
    According to Jian Bozan's "theory," peasant wars cannot possibly be guided by revolutionary ideas, and peasant wars are just wars fought by a group of people with another group in order to become emperors and landlords. They are feudal wars for power and profit, not revolutionary wars of peasants against the landlord class at all.
    It is particularly worth pointing out that "The Outline" does not hesitate to lavishly exaggerate the "role" of the landlord elements who infiltrated the peasant uprising army. The book said that the reason why Zhu Yuanzhang's uprising was able to achieve victory and establish the Ming Dynasty was because he "recruited Liu Ji, Song Lian, Hu Shen, Zhang Yi and others, representatives of the landlord class in eastern Zhejiang. In particular, Liu Ji and Song Lian played a significant role in Zhu Yuanzhang's founding cause" (Middle Volume, p. 139). When describing the slogans of Li Zicheng's uprising, "Equality of fields regardless of status," "Welcome King Chuang, no grain to pay," "The Outline" specifically emphasized that this was proposed by "Li Yan, a juren from ? County" (Middle Volume, pp. 243-244). The author's meaning is very clear: without Li Yan, this intellectual of the landlord class, the peasants would not be able to put forward such a positive slogan at all.
    "The Outline" wantonly slandered and distorted the peasants' struggle against the landlord class.
    May I ask, during the Wang Xiaobo and Li Shun uprising, they "summoned all the rich and powerful families in the township and ordered them to provide all their wealth and grain at home, and allocated everything except what was needed for their own livelihood and the number of their families to relieve poverty" (Shen Kuo: "Mengxi Bitian" Volume 15). During the Zhong Xiang and Yang Mo uprising, they announced that they would execute officials, monks, Taoists, diviners, Confucian scholars, etc., but would not harm "those who hold plows" (Hu Yin: "Feiran Collection" 17 "Letter to Zhang Deyuan"). Can it be said that the peasant uprising only opposed individual officials and landlords, and did not "oppose landlords as a class"?
    May I ask, during the Zhong Xiang and Yang Mo uprising, they declared the "national code" of the ruling class to be "evil laws," and announced that "in enforcing the law, equality should be given to the noble and the lowly, and wealth should be distributed equally" ("Sanchao Beimeng Huibian" Volume 137 "Zhong Xiang Rebels in Wuling"). Li Zicheng's uprising proposed "equal land" and "no labor or grain payment." Isn't this opposing the feudal oppression and exploitation system, but rather maintaining the feudal kingship and maintaining the feudal exploitation order?
    May I ask, in the late Western Han Dynasty, the Nanyang landlords Liu Yan and Liu Xiu brothers infiltrated the Green Forest Army, took the opportunity to expand their power, and finally eliminated the peasant army and established the Eastern Han regime. At the end of the Sui Dynasty, Li Mi defected to the Wagang Uprising Army, established his cronies, and caused the Wagang Army to split and fail. Don't these historical facts fully show that landlord class elements who defected to the peasant uprising army all held evil political conspiracies and played a corrosive and disintegrating role in the peasant uprising army?
    Existence determines consciousness. In feudal society, the oppressed and exploited status of the peasants determined that they were a revolutionary class against the landlord class and determined the anti-feudal nature of peasant uprisings, regardless of whether they clearly recognized the landlord as a class. Although they did not have a clear scientific understanding of the feudal exploitation system, in the long-term practice of being exploited and oppressed and in class struggle, they were able to gradually realize that landlords, officials, nobles, and emperors were all their enemies, and that feudal kingship was a great mountain pressing down on them.
    Marxists always enthusiastically sing praises of the revolutionary wars of the oppressed classes. Chairman Mao said: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without them, it is impossible to complete the leap of social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to gain political power" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume I, p. 322). He also said: "Only by destroying the old and decaying things can we build new and sound things" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, pp. 725-726). Revolutionary war, including historical peasant wars, "has great power, it can transform many things, or pave the way for transforming things" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume II, p. 447).
    Starting from the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, Jian Bozan, in "A General History of China," not only avoids talking about the role of peasant wars in promoting the historical development of feudal society, but also describes peasant wars as an inexcusable destructive force of social production. For example, "The Outline" equates the peasant wars and powerful clan annexation wars at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, believing that the consequences they brought were:
    "...severely disrupted the order of rural society. A large number of landlords in the north fled to the south... As a result, 'fields had no permanent owners, and people had no permanent residences' everywhere in the rural areas of the north. Large tracts of wasteland could not be reclaimed, agricultural production severely declined, and people lived in hunger" (Volume II, p. 6). Peasant wars drove away the landlords, making "fields have no permanent owners," which was a great thing, but in Jian Bozan's view, it was a cause of "severe decline in agricultural production and people living in hunger." The revolutionary peasants must bear the "crime" of destroying social production!
    "The Outline" also said that the great peasant uprising at the end of the Sui Dynasty caused "the social economy to be devastated in the early Tang Dynasty," making "the downstream area of the Yellow River 'a vast expanse of reeds and swamps, uninhabited for thousands of miles, and no sound of chickens or dogs could be heard.'" (Volume II, p. 159)
    The Huang Chao uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty was also described by "The Outline" as making Luoyang and its nearby prefectures and counties "desolate and overgrown with weeds. White bones covered the fields, and there were no residents outside" (Middle Volume, p. 4).
    In short, Jian Bozan, in "The Outline," used the most vicious language of past ruling classes to shamelessly curse and slander peasant uprisings. Peasant wars were described as "barbaric" wars that destroyed everything, and the uprising peasants simply became unforgivable historical "criminals"! Revolutionary war is not the locomotive driving history forward, but has become an obstacle to history!
    Countless historical facts show that it was not peasant uprisings that caused the destruction of the social economy, but the ruling class's mad class revenge and their mutual slaughter. In peasant wars, peasants not only used violence to destroy all the shackles that hindered the development of productive forces, but also directly used revolutionary forces to protect their own production. Cao Cao suppressed the Yellow Turbans in Runan and Yingchuan and obtained a large number of plows and agricultural tools. Doesn't this precisely show that the peasants who participated in the Yellow Turban Uprising were fighting while insisting on production? How can we say that the uprising peasants were destroyers of production?
    When the Huang Chao Uprising Army marched north, even the rulers could not but admit that the Uprising Army "maintained discipline and did not plunder," and when they occupied Luoyang, "the neighborhoods were peaceful" ("Zizhi Tongjian" Volume 254). How can the scene of "white bones covering the fields" near Luoyang be falsely recorded in the account of the "war" of the Huang Chao Uprising?
    Jian Bozan once said: "The class nature of historians is not only manifested in the analysis and judgment of historical materials, but also in the selection of historical materials. Marx said: 'The special nature of the materials studied by economics will arouse the most intense, mean, and evil feelings in people's hearts, and summon the avenging god representing private interests to the battlefield to hinder it.' Historical materials are the same" ("People's Daily," July 15, 1958, "The Struggle Between Two Lines on the Historical Science Front"). This passage hit himself in the face with a loud slap. It seems that the historical materials of peasant wars did arouse Jian Bozan's "most intense, mean, and evil" class "feelings." These feelings exactly exposed his complete endorsement of the reactionary arguments of modern revisionists, headed by the Soviet Communist Party leadership group, who slandered revolutionary war.
    Chairman Mao often taught us never to forget class struggle. Jian Bozan, like all representatives of the bourgeoisie, vigorously advocated class reconciliation and class cooperation in order to corrode and invade the revolutionary people, so that they could carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. The views of "A General History of China" on the issue of peasant wars were concocted to meet such needs.
    Beautifying the Landlord Class, Praising Emperors, Generals, and Ministers
    Jian Bozan is a leading general of the "royalist party." In recent years, he has been running around to fight for the historical status of emperors, generals, and ministers. "A General History of China," on the one hand, tried its best to denigrate peasant wars, denying that the working people are the masters of history, and on the other hand, described those bloodsuckers who rode on the heads of the working people as historical "meritorious officials" who made the "interrupted" social production develop, and disguised those executioners who suppressed peasant uprisings as "saviors" who saved the peasants from "hunger."
    When "The Outline" praised Cao Cao's "achievements," it wrote: After the Yellow Turban Uprising, society regressed, and the peasants could not survive. Then, "Cao Cao, a far-sighted figure of the landlord class," appeared as a "savior." "When all the separatists turned a blind eye to this difficult situation, Cao Cao adopted the suggestions of Zao Zhi and Han Hao and began to cultivate land and store grain." Because "the reclamation area can guarantee farming time, provide cattle, concentrate efforts on building water conservancy projects, and pay attention to intensive cultivation in terms of technology without forcing the expansion of cultivated land area, these are suitable for the requirements of reclamation farmers and are conducive to increasing grain production. The reclamation system has these conditions, so it can stabilize agricultural production in the north in a short period of time." Due to Cao Cao's measures, by the time of "Emperor Wen and Emperor Ming of the Wei Dynasty, agricultural production in the Central Plains had been considerably restored" (Volume II, pp. 3, 4, 7, 11).
    How did the economy of the Northern Wei Dynasty develop? "The Outline" said that it was because Emperor Xiaowen's policies "more or less improved the situation of the peasants, weakened the political, economic, and patriarchal control of the large landlords over the peasants, and thus played a positive role in the development of productive forces," making "the declining economy of the north begin to recover" and "have obvious development." "Since Emperor Xiaowen relaxed control over the technical households, the handicraft production of the people became increasingly active." (Volume II, pp. 57, 60, 61) In short, it was Emperor Xiaowen's "benevolent government" that promoted the economic development at that time.
    The emergence of the "Yuanjia Governance" of the Southern Dynasty Liu Song was also due to Liu Yu's making "the lives of the peasants somewhat improved," so that "social production showed an upward trend." (Volume II, p. 90)
    The social economy of the Sui Dynasty had further development because "the Sui Dynasty's measures to reduce labor and taxes and the stability of society promoted the development of agricultural production. Farmers in vast areas were able to enjoy farming and engage in fishing." (Volume II, p. 145)
    In the Central Plains area in the early Five Dynasties, who would clean up the "bad consequences" left by the Huang Chao "war"? "The Outline" wrote: Because "Zhang Quanyi 'led more than a hundred people under his command' to go there to be local officials," "recruited farmers, ordered them to cultivate, and exempted them from rent and taxation in the market for the first few years." "The farmers here obtained the conditions to engage in production," "so that every household had savings, and there were no hungry people in times of drought and flood" (Middle Volume, p. 4). "The Outline" cannot but admit that Qian Liu "organized landlord armed forces to suppress the uprising army," but it also said that "Qian Liu and his successors did not excessively increase the burden of corvée labor and taxes on the people, nor did they launch frequent wars. Therefore, during the eighty years of Wu and Yue's rule, the economy of this region was relatively developed." (Middle Volume, p. 6)
    "The Outline" used the phrase "made contributions to the people" to praise the rulers of the early Qing Dynasty. It said that Kangxi "had some research on hydraulics and surveying," and "repeatedly went to" water conservancy construction sites "to conduct surveys." It also said that Jin Fu, the river governor appointed by Kangxi, "was very talented" and had been "loved by the peasants" "for a long time." The book also described the deceptive measures taken by the Qing rulers to strengthen feudal rule as "preventing the landlords' illegal exploitation of the peasants, relaxing the landlords' personal control over the peasants, and slaves also obtained certain freedom." (Middle Volume, pp. 270, 264)
    Through such descriptions, Jian Bozan tried to make people believe that the landlord class of feudal society were all "saviors" of the peasants, and only by relying on the landlord class could the peasants engage in production and survive; without the "grace" of the landlord lords, the peasant class could not survive.
    Engels said: "Since the basis of civilization is the exploitation of one class by another, all its development is carried out in constant contradictions. Every step forward in the field of production also means a step backward in the living conditions of the oppressed class, that is, the majority of the people. The interests of one class must be the disaster of another class" ("The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State," p. 170). The so-called measures taken by the feudal exploiting class to develop production were only to extract more blood and sweat from the peasants. Therefore, whenever production further developed, what followed was always the sharpening of class contradictions and another new large-scale uprising of peasants.
    Jian Bozan's fervent beautification of the landlord class and praise of emperors, generals, and ministers in his "Outline" were by no means accidental.
    When Jian Bozan was absorbed in writing "The Outline," the overthrown class enemies in the country were frantically engaged in restoration activities. The overthrown landlord class elements were not willing to die, and they engaged in genealogy, publicizing how "kind" and "benevolent" their ancestors were, and wanted to use feudal patriarchalism to confront the proletarian dictatorship. Some bourgeois intellectuals also used the means of beautifying the ancients to resurrect the capitalist soul with the corpses of feudalism. At this time, Jian Bozan, by writing history, vigorously promoted the "grace" of the exploiting class to the working people in history, wasn't he precisely providing "historical basis" for these exploiting classes who were unwilling to die to carry out restoration activities?
    It was at this time that the communiqué of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to the people of the whole country: Never forget class struggle, never forget the past class suffering. Jian Bozan, however, distorted history through "The Outline," asking people not to forget the "merit" of the exploiting class and not to forget the "grace" that the exploiting class gave to the working people. Isn't this blatant anti-Party and anti-socialism?
    Praising the "Concession" Policies of the Exploiting Classes, Promoting the Philosophy of Survival as a Slave
    Jian Bozan and "The Outline" he edited also wantonly distorted history, vigorously praised the "wisdom" and "concession" of the exploiting classes, and promoted class capitulationism and the philosophy of survival as a slave.
    Jian Bozan's set of reactionary theoretical views has been around for a long time. As early as in his 1951 article "On Peasant Wars in Ancient China," he tried his best to exaggerate the "concession" of the feudal ruling class and praised the "wisdom" of the rulers. He said:
    "After every major riot, the new feudal rulers, in order to restore feudal order, must make a certain degree of concession to the peasants, that is to say, they must more or less reduce the exploitation and oppression of the peasants, which reduces the feudal relations of production on the productive forces, so that the productive forces of feudal society can continue to develop, thus promoting the progress of Chinese history."
    In 1961 and 1962, under the situation of the rampant attacks of enemies at home and abroad, in order to cooperate with the restoration activities of the class enemies, Jian Bozan vigorously promoted his set of reactionary views through "A General History of China."
    Peasant war in feudal society is the peasant class rising up to revolutionize against the feudal landlord class. "Restoring feudal order" is the feudal landlord class carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration. This is a sharp struggle of life and death. In this struggle, can the ruling class become more "kind"? Can it become more "wise"? Absolutely not. Chairman Mao taught that: "The principle of the reactionary forces towards the democratic forces of the people is that those who can be eliminated must be eliminated, and those who cannot be eliminated temporarily must be prepared to be eliminated in the future." All reactionaries always seize every inch of power and every bit of profit from the people. When the revolution suffers a setback, when the counter-revolutionary forces are restored, when the revolution has been submerged in the bloody suppression of the rulers, the ruling class, as the executioner, has no "concession" to the revolutionary peasant class at all, but only counter-attack and reckoning; there is no acceptance of lessons or repentance at all, but only getting an inch and wanting a yard. For example, during the Wu De period of the Tang Dynasty, after Liu Heita's first uprising failed, Li Yuan once ordered that all the revolutionary peasants in the Hebei and Shandong areas be killed; after the second uprising was suppressed, he ordered that all men over the age of fifteen in the Hebei and Shandong areas be killed, and the women and children be moved to Guanzhong. Although these two killing orders were not fully implemented, they reflected the ruling class's deep-seated hatred for the revolutionary peasants. There are countless examples of such bloody suppression of peasant revolutions in history.
    "The Outline" does not reveal and criticize the feudal ruling class's counter-attack and reckoning's cruel and despicable behavior at all, but arbitrarily distorts history, and takes the reactionary "concession theory" as the guiding ideology of the whole book. Whenever a new dynasty is established in the blood of peasant wars, the editors always arrange a section on the ruling class's "measures to restore and develop agricultural production," followed by a section on "the development and prosperity of the social economy," and so on. In this way, the emperors of the new dynasty, the biggest executioners who slaughtered revolutionary peasants, one by one became "wise" figures in Jian Bozan's pen, "benevolent" figures with great kindness. Such praise is not enough. Jian Bozan even believes that not only do "wise" figures appear in the new dynasties established after the failure of every large-scale peasant revolution, and the "concession policy" of great compassion for the peasants is implemented, but also after every small-scale peasant uprising. As mentioned in the book, when talking about the peasant uprising led by Chen Sanqiang and others in Jiangxi during the Southern Song Dynasty, it said: "This small-scale uprising struggle also forced the rulers to make a certain degree of concession measures." (Middle Volume, p. 90) That is to say, except for the rulers of the feudal dynasties directly destroyed by the peasant revolutionary army, the entire feudal ruling class can become "wise" and "benevolent." As long as the peasant class can accept the "concession" policy of the rulers and abandon violent revolution, they can "cooperate" with the feudal ruling class to establish a "common prosperous" society.
    Since 1959, while Jian Bozan has been vigorously advocating the "concession" of the ruling class, he has also vigorously promoted class capitulationism and the philosophy of survival as a slave. In the article "It Is Necessary to Restore Cao Cao's Reputation" ("Guangming Daily," February 19, 1959), he even compared the uprising peasants to "hungry donkeys," declaring that the new dynasty's feudal rulers' "concession" of a bundle of dry grass to the people had "met the wishes of the people at that time." He said: "For the peasants, the Cao Wei Dynasty, even if it was not a bundle of dry grass, but a round of beatings," was "always a lighter round of beatings" than the old dynasty; the reactionary reclamation measures "for the peasants at that time, may still be a bundle of dry grass, although not very good dry grass." If Jian Bozan's meaning is expressed in more direct and easily understandable language, that is to say: The people's wish is to "survive," even if it is servile, kneeling and begging, or being "beaten for a while." This is simply the most despicable slander against revolutionary peasants!
    This kind of reactionary argument is full of "The Outline." For example, the book absurdly concludes that the reason why frequent peasant riots in the Southern Dynasty did not converge into large-scale peasant wars was because at that time, peasants could "flee to private homes to become slaves and guests, or entrust themselves to temples to become white disciples and adopted daughters, and be enslaved by monks and secular landlords," finding a "place to live" and "obtaining a glimmer of hope" (Volume II, p. 101). This is equivalent to saying that the peasants under feudal cruel exploitation and enslavement, as long as they have a "glimmer of hope" as Jian Bozan said, can "survive," they are willing to bow down at the feet of the feudal ruling class, satisfied with the humble slave-like life, instead of rising up to revolutionize against the feudal landlord lords.
    Chairman Mao taught us: In the history of human class struggle, there are two logics: The logic of all reactionaries is "make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until extinction"; the logic of the people is "struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, pp. 1490-1491). These two logics are a scientific generalization of the history of human class struggle, and are universal truths that apply everywhere. They are ideological weapons for guiding the current great revolutionary struggle and opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Jian Bozan, however, sang the opposite tune, vigorously praising the "benevolence" of the rulers and vigorously promoting the philosophy of survival as a slave. His set of reactionary views echoed the trend of modern revisionism and served the right-leaning opportunist anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.
      * * *
    Any counter-revolutionary restoration must first start from the ideological field. Jian Bozan's "A General History of China" is a poisonous arrow launched by the bourgeoisie to attack us. It is an important tool for them to promote peaceful evolution and restore capitalism. It is particularly worth noting that this "Outline" is a textbook for universities, and it has had a very harmful influence on young students who have no or lack actual class struggle experience. In the field of history, this book has also played an extremely bad role in spreading the reactionary ideas of revisionism. We must thoroughly expose and criticize such a big poisonous weed that is anti-Party and anti-socialist. In this socialist cultural revolution, we must completely destroy Jian Bozan's reactionary historical theory.

    评翦伯赞的《中国史纲要》
    司马洪涛
    一九六○到一九六二年，在我国遭到暂时经济困难的时候，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派发动了反华大合唱。国内被打倒的阶级敌人也以为他们的“春天”到了，纷纷从阴沟里钻出来，向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻。
    就在这个时候，翦伯赞扛起了反党反社会主义的黑旗，提出了一整套反动的史学理论，公然向我们党和社会主义的命根子——毛泽东思想挑战。
    翦伯赞对社会主义文化革命极端仇视。一九五八年以来，在一些高等学校和研究机构，革命的史学工作者在党的领导下，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导，组织起来，编写教材，重新改写历史。在这个过程中，翦伯赞发表了《学习司马光编写〈通鉴〉的精神》一文（《人民日报》一九六一年六月十八日），借司马光的幽灵，大肆攻击史学革命，诬蔑党领导下的集体编书是“浮躁急迫”，是“突击的方法”。他提出一条反党的组织路线，鼓吹“要搞好集体编写历史的工作”，每一部书都“要有一个司马光”，也就是说，要有一个象司马光那样既是政治上的“反对派”，又是所谓“专家”的人来作“主编”，自行邀请“具有专门研究而又是志同道合的朋友”合作才成。
    为了贯彻他的反动史学理论，翦伯赞以司马光自命，邀请了几个“志同道合”的朋友兼所谓“学者”，着手编写《中国史纲要》。
    一九六一年十二月，《中国史纲要》正在编写，翦伯赞就迫不及待地抛出了他给这本书规定的指导原则——《对处理若干历史问题的初步意见》一文（《光明日报》一九六一年十二月二十二日）。他以“大师”的姿态，装腔作势，妄图以他的反马克思主义、反毛泽东思想的史学理论，和革命的史学工作者对抗。
    一九六二年初，翦伯赞兴致冲冲地带着他的一帮“志同道合的朋友”到苏州，“亲自”动手，对《中国史纲要》进行修改。这一年的十月，他又发表了《目前史学研究中存在的几个问题》一文（《江海学刊》一九六二年第六期），用恶毒的语言攻击毛泽东思想，攻击无产阶级的阶级斗争学说，反对历史研究为无产阶级政治服务，竭力美化封建帝王将相，鼓吹现代修正主义的“历史主义”。
    现在，《中国史纲要》已陆续出版了第二、三、四册。这里，我们就第二、三册的内容作一些剖析，看看翦伯赞在这部书中所贩卖的究竟是些什么？他急切编写这部书的目的究竟是为了什么？
    诬蔑农民革命，宣扬阶级调和
    毛主席说：“封建社会的主要矛盾，是农民阶级和地主阶级的矛盾。”“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第六一九页）
    毛主席的科学论断，是我们研究中国封建社会历史的基本线索。而贯穿在《中国史纲要》中的指导思想，却完全和毛主席的指示针锋相对。这本书否认农民和地主阶级的矛盾是封建社会自始至终的主要矛盾，丑化革命农民，抹煞农民起义的革命性质，否定农民起义推动封建社会发展的伟大历史作用。
    翦伯赞在《对处理若干历史问题的初步意见》中说，封建社会的主要矛盾“有时是敌对阶级间的矛盾，有时是统治阶级内部的矛盾，有时是民族间的矛盾，不要把任何历史时期的主要矛盾都说成是敌对阶级间的矛盾。”《中国史纲要》根据这一原则，把许多统治阶级的内部矛盾当作主要矛盾，大书特书，而把当时的阶级矛盾摆在统治阶级内部矛盾的从属地位。例如，书中说，益州黄巾被镇压下去以后，“益州地区也和中原一样，地主阶级各个集团之间的矛盾就逐渐上升起来。”（第二册，第一五页）《纲要》甚至把农民说成是统治阶级争权夺利的“同盟军”。例如，在描述隋初江南地主起兵反隋时，写道：“由于豪族地主得不到广大农民的支持，变乱很快就被压服下去”。在谈到徐敬业和唐宗室诸王起兵反对武则天的事件时说：“由于得不到各地地主（按：指中、小地主）和人民的支持，这两次变乱都迅速归于失败”。（第二册，第一四五、一六七页）这简直是海外奇谈！农民阶级和地主阶级是根本对立的两个阶级，农民怎么会成为地主阶级内部争权夺利的斗争一方的“支持者”呢！
    《中国史纲要》认为，农民起义的原因不是封建制度的残酷剥削和压迫，反倒是由于封建制度遭到了破坏。例如，在谈到北魏末年的农民起义时，《纲要》写道：“均田秩序迅速破坏了”，“掠卖良口为奴婢的事，不再受到法律的制止”，于是，“无路可走的农民群起暴动”。（第二册，第六六页）后梁时，陈州农民毋乙和董乙领导的起义，则是由于“后梁皇亲朱友能做陈州的刺史，‘恃戚藩之宠，动多不法’。”（中册，第二页）
    这就是说，农民起义的原因是由于地主阶级的封建剥削秩序遭到破坏，是由于农民得不到封建王法的保护。按照这种荒谬的论调，农民起义倒成了维护封建王法、维护封建剥削秩序的斗争！翦伯赞就是通过这种手法，来贯彻他的农民不“把封建当作一个制度来反对”的反动理论。
    《纲要》在谈到李自成领导的明末农民大起义时，说农民军领导集团内部存在着三种不同的思想：一种是以刘宗敏等为代表的“没有政治远见”的“流寇主义思想”，再一种是以牛金星等为代表的“官僚地主的思想”，还有一种是以李岩为代表的希望“迅速建立一种新的封建秩序”的思想，而李自成本人，则被说成是“立志要推翻明朝，以成帝王之业”（中册，第二四三——二四七页）。
    按照翦伯赞的“理论”，农民战争根本不可能有革命的思想作指导，农民战争不过是某一批人为了当皇帝、当地主而和另一批人进行的战争，是争权夺利的封建战争，根本不是农民反对地主阶级的革命战争。
    特别值得指出的是，《纲要》对混进农民起义队伍中的地主分子不惜笔墨，大肆渲染他们的“作用”。该书说朱元璋起义所以能取得胜利，建立明王朝，是由于他“罗致了浙东地主阶级的代表人物刘基、宋濂、胡深、章溢等人。特别是刘基、宋濂在朱元璋的开创事业中起了显著的作用”（中册，第一三九页）。在叙述李自成起义的“贵贱均田”、“迎闯王，不纳粮”的口号时，《纲要》特别强调这是“?县举人李岩”提出的（中册，第二四三——二四四页）。作者的意思很明显：没有李岩这个地主阶级知识分子，农民根本提不出这样积极的口号。
    《纲要》对农民反抗地主阶级的斗争肆意进行了诬蔑和歪曲。
    请问，王小波、李顺起义，“悉召乡里富人大姓，令具其家所有财粟，据其生齿足用之外，一切调发，大赈贫乏”（沈括：《梦溪笔谈》卷十五）。钟相、杨么起义，宣布要诛杀官吏、僧道、卜祝、儒生等类的人，唯独不伤“执耒之夫”（胡寅《斐然集》十七《寄张德远书》）。这能够说农民起义只反对个别官吏和地主，不把地主“作为一个阶级来反对”吗？
    请问，钟相、杨么起义，宣布统治阶级的“国典”为“邪法”，宣布“行法，当等贵贱，均贫富”（《三朝北盟会编》卷一百三十七《武陵百姓钟相反》条）。李自成起义提出“均田”，“不当差，不纳粮”。这难道不是反对封建的压迫、剥削制度，反倒是维护封建王法，维护封建剥削秩序吗？
    请问，西汉末年，南阳大地主刘縯、刘秀兄弟混入绿林军，趁机扩大势力，最后消灭农民军，建立东汉政权。隋末李密投奔瓦岗起义军，树立党羽，使瓦岗军分裂失败。这些史实难道不充分说明，地主阶级分子投奔农民起义军，都是抱着罪恶的政治阴谋，对农民起义军起着腐蚀瓦解的作用吗？
    存在决定意识。在封建社会中，农民所处的被压迫、被剥削的地位，决定了他们是反对地主阶级的革命阶级，决定了农民起义的反封建的性质，不管他们是否明确认识到地主是一个阶级。他们对封建剥削制度虽然没有明确的科学的认识，但是在长期的被剥削被压迫的生活实践和阶级斗争中，能够逐渐认识到地主、官吏、贵族和皇帝都是他们的敌人，认识到封建王法是压在他们头上的大山。
    马克思主义者总是热情地歌颂被压迫阶级的革命战争。毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第三二二页）。又说：“只有破坏旧的腐朽的东西，才能建设新的健全的东西”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第七二五——七二六页）。革命战争，包括历史上的农民战争，“其力量是很大的，它能改造很多事物，或为改造事物开辟道路”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷，第四四七页）。
    翦伯赞从资产阶级的反动立场出发，在《中国史纲要》中不仅避而不谈农民战争推动封建社会历史发展的作用，还把农民战争描写成社会生产的不可饶恕的破坏力量。例如，《纲要》把东汉末年的农民战争和豪强兼并战争相提并论，认为它们带来的后果是：
    “……严重地破坏了农村社会的秩序。北方地主大量地向南方流亡……。这样，北方农村中到处是‘田无常主，民无常居’，大量荒地无法开垦，农业生产严重衰败，人民生活在饥饿之中”（第二册，第六页）。农民战争赶跑了地主，使得“田无常主”，这是一件大好事，但在翦伯赞看来，却是造成“农业生产严重衰败，人民生活在饥饿之中”的一个原因。革命的农民竟必须承担破坏社会生产的“罪名”！
    《纲要》对隋末农民大起义，也说它造成了“唐朝初年，社会经济雕敝”，使“黄河下游地区，‘萑莽巨泽，茫茫千里，人烟断绝，鸡犬不闻’。”（第二册，第一五九页）
    唐末黄巢大起义，也被《纲要》描述成使洛阳及其附近州郡“县邑荒废，悉为榛莽。白骨蔽野，外绝居人”（中册，第四页）。
    总之，翦伯赞在《纲要》中，使用了历代统治阶级最恶毒的语言，对农民起义进行了无耻咒骂和诬蔑。农民战争被说成是破坏一切的“野蛮”的战争，起义农民简直成了十恶不赦的历史“罪人”！革命战争不是推动历史前进的火车头，倒成了历史的阻力！
    无数历史事实表明，造成社会经济破坏的，不是农民起义，而是统治阶级的疯狂阶级报复和他们的互相砍杀。农民战争中，农民不仅用暴力摧毁一切束缚生产力发展的桎梏，还直接用革命力量保卫自己的生产。曹操镇压汝南、颖川的黄巾军，获得大批耕牛农具，不正好说明参加黄巾起义的农民是一边战斗，一边坚持生产吗？怎么能说起义农民是生产的破坏者？
    当黄巢起义军北上时，连统治者也不能不承认起义军“整众不剽掠”，攻占洛阳时是“闾里晏然”（《资治通鉴》卷二五四），怎么可以把洛阳附近的“白骨蔽野”景象，诬记在黄巢起义的“战乱”的账上呢？
    翦伯赞曾经说：“史学家的阶级性，不仅表现在对史料的分析与论断上，也表现在史料的选择上。马克思说：‘经济学研究的材料的特殊性质，会把人心中最激烈最卑鄙最恶劣的感情唤起，把代表私人利益的仇神召到战场上来阻碍它’。历史的资料也是一样”（《人民日报》一九五八年七月十五日《历史科学战线上两条路线的斗争》）。这段话，恰恰打了他自己一记响亮的耳光。看来，农民战争史的资料确实唤起了翦伯赞“最激烈最卑鄙最恶劣”的阶级“感情”。这种感情正好暴露了他完全附和以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义者诬蔑革命战争的反动论调。
    毛主席经常教导我们，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。翦伯赞和一切资产阶级的代表人物一样，却大肆鼓吹阶级调和与阶级合作，以此来腐蚀侵袭革命的人民，便于他们进行反革命的复辟活动。《中国史纲要》在农民战争问题上的观点，就是适应这样的需要炮制出来的。
    美化地主阶级，讴歌帝王将相
    翦伯赞是“保皇党”的一员大将。几年来，他到处奔走，为帝王将相争历史地位。《中国史纲要》一方面极力诋毁农民战争，否定劳动人民是历史的主人，另方面又把那些骑在劳动人民头上的吸血鬼们，说成是使“中断”了的社会生产发展起来的历史“功臣”，把那些镇压农民起义的刽子手们，打扮成使农民免于“饥饿之中”的“救世主”。
    《纲要》在讴歌曹操的“功绩”时写道：黄巾起义后，社会倒退了，农民活不下去了。于是，“地主阶级的一个有远见的人物”曹操就以“救世英雄”出现了。“当所有的割据者面对这种艰苦境况熟视无睹时，曹操却采取枣祗、韩浩的建议，着手屯田积谷”。由于“屯田区能够保障农时，能够提供耕牛，能够集中力量兴修水利，而且在技术上讲究精耕细作，不强求扩大耕地面积，这些都适合屯田民的要求，有利于提高粮食的产量。屯田制具有这些条件，所以能够在短期内稳定北方的农业生产”。由于曹操的这些措施，到“魏文帝、明帝时，中原地区的农业已有了相当的恢复”（第二册，第三、四、七、十一页）。
    北魏的经济是怎样发展起来的呢？《纲要》说，是由于魏孝文帝的政策“或多或少的改善了农民的处境，削弱了大地主对农民的政治的、经济的、宗法的控制力量，因而对生产力的发展起了积极作用”，使“北方衰败的经济开始回升”，并且“有了明显的发展”。“自从孝文帝放松对伎作户的控制后，民间的手工业生产日益活跃”。（第二册，第五七、六○、六一页）总之，是魏孝文帝的“仁政”，促进了当时经济的发展。
    南朝刘宋“元嘉之治”的出现，也是刘裕使“农民的生活得到了一些改善”，才使“社会生产出现了上升的景象”。（第二册，第九○页）
    隋朝的社会经济有进一步发展，原因是“隋王朝减轻徭赋的措施和社会的安定，促进了农业生产的发展。广大地区的农民都能好尚稼穑，多事田渔。”（第二册，第一四五页）
    五代初年的中原地区，经过黄巢“战乱”留下的“恶果”，谁来收拾呢？《纲要》写道：由于“张全义‘率麾下百余人’到那里去做地方官”，“招辑农户，令其耕种，并于最初几年内免其租税和关市之征”。“这里的农民得到了能够从事生产的条件”，“是以家家有蓄积，水旱无饥民”（中册，第四页）。《纲要》不能不承认钱镠“组织了地主武装，对起义军进行镇压”，但又说“钱镠和他的继承人都没有过分地加重人民的徭役和赋税的负担，也没有发动频繁的战争，因此，在吴越统治的八十多年中，这一地区的经济比较发展”。（中册，第六页）
    《纲要》用“对人民立下了功劳”这样的词句，来颂扬清初的统治者。说康熙“对水利学和测量学都有一些研究”，“多次亲赴”水利工地“进行勘察”。又说康熙任用的河道总督靳辅“很有才干”，“长期以来”受到“农民的爱戴”。书中还把清统治者采取的加强封建统治的欺骗措施，说成是“防止了地主对农民的非法剥削，放松了地主对农民的人身束缚，奴婢也获得一定的自由”。（中册，第二七○、二六四页）
    翦伯赞通过这样的描述，力图使人们相信，封建社会的地主阶级都是农民的“救命恩人”，只有依靠地主阶级，农民才能够从事生产，才能活命；如果没有地主老爷的“恩典”，农民阶级就活不下去了。
    恩格斯说：“文明底基础既是一个阶级剥削另一个阶级，那末它的全部发展便是在经常的矛盾中进行的。生产领域里每前进一步，同时也就意味着被压迫阶级即大多数人的生活状况后退一步。对一个阶级的利益，必然是对别一个阶级的灾难”（《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》，第一七○页）。封建剥削阶级所采取的一些所谓发展生产的措施，都不过是为了从农民那里剥夺更多的血汗，因此，每当生产进一步发展后，伴随而来的总是阶级矛盾的尖锐化和农民的又一次新的大规模的起义。
    翦伯赞在他的《纲要》中，这样狂热地美化地主阶级，讴歌帝王将相，决不是偶然的。
    当翦伯赞醉心于编写《纲要》时，国内被打倒的阶级敌人正在猖狂地搞复辟活动。被打倒的地主阶级分子不甘心死亡，大搞续家谱，宣传他们的祖宗如何“善良”，如何“恩慈”，想借封建宗法与无产阶级专政对抗。一些资产阶级知识分子也通过美化古人的手段，借封建之僵尸，还资本主义之魂。翦伯赞在这时通过编写历史，极力宣扬历史上剥削阶级对劳动人民的“恩典”，不是正好为这些不甘心死亡的剥削阶级进行复辟活动，提供“历史依据”吗？
    就在这个时候，党的八届十中全会公报向全国人民发出了号召：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记旧日的阶级苦。翦伯赞却通过《纲要》，歪曲历史，让人们不要忘记剥削阶级的“功劳”，不要忘记剥削阶级给劳动人民的“恩典”。这不是明目张胆地反党反社会主义又是什么呢？
    吹捧剥削阶级的“让步”政策，宣扬活命的奴才哲学
    翦伯赞和他主编的《纲要》，还肆意歪曲历史，大肆吹捧剥削阶级的“明智”与“让步”，宣扬阶级投降主义和活命的奴才哲学。
    翦伯赞的这套反动理论观点，是由来已久的。早在一九五一年的《论中国古代的农民战争》一文中，他就极力渲染封建统治阶级的“让步”，吹捧统治者的“明智”。他说：
    “在每一次大暴动之后，新的封建统治者，为了恢复封建秩序，必须对农民作某种程度的让步，这就是说必须或多或少减轻对农民的剥削和压迫，这样就减轻了封建生产关系对生产力的拘束，使得封建社会的生产力又有继续发展的可能，这样就推动了中国历史的前进”。
    一九六一、六二年，在国内外敌人猖狂进攻的形势下，为了配合阶级敌人的复辟活动，翦伯赞就通过《中国史纲要》大肆宣扬他的这套反动观点。
    封建社会的农民战争，是农民阶级起来革封建地主阶级的命。“恢复封建秩序”，则是封建地主阶级进行反革命的复辟。这是你死我活的尖锐斗争。在这种斗争中，统治阶级难道能变得“仁慈”一些吗？能够变得“明智”一些吗？断然不会。毛主席教导说：“反动势力对于人民的民主势力的原则，是能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之。”一切反动派对于人民总是寸权必夺，寸利必得的。在革命遭到失败的时候，在反革命势力复辟的时候，在革命已经淹没在统治者的残酷镇压的血泊中的时候，作为刽子手的统治阶级对于革命的农民阶级，根本没有什么“让步”，而只有反攻倒算；根本没有什么接受教训、翻然悔改，而只有得寸进尺、变本加厉。例如唐武德时，刘黑闼第一次起义失败后，李渊曾下令要杀尽河北、山东地区的革命农民；第二次起义被镇压下去，又令杀光河北、山东地区十五岁以上的男子，把妇女和小孩迁入关中。这两次屠杀令虽未能完全实行，却反映了统治阶级对革命农民的刻骨仇恨。象这种血腥镇压农民革命的事例，在历史上是不胜枚举的。
    《纲要》丝毫不去揭露和抨击封建统治阶级这种反攻倒算的残酷、卑劣的行为，反而任意歪曲历史，把反动的“让步论”作为全书的指导思想。凡是在农民战争的血泊中建立的新王朝，编者总要安排一节统治阶级“恢复和发展农业生产的措施”，紧接着便是一节“社会经济的发展和繁荣”等等。就是这样，新王朝的帝王，屠杀革命农民的最大的刽子手，一个个都在翦伯赞的笔下变成了“明智派”的人物，大发善心的“仁慈”人物。这样吹捧还不够，翦伯赞甚至认为，不仅每次大规模的农民革命失败后建立的新王朝有“明智派”的人物出现，有对农民大发慈悲心肠的“让步政策”的实施，而且连每次小规模的农民起义以后，也是这样。如书中提到南宋江西陈三枪等领导的农民起义时说：“这次小规模的起义斗争，也逼令统治者不得不作出一定程度的让步措施。”（中册，第九○页）这就是说，除了被农民革命军直接摧垮的封建王朝的统治者以外，整个封建统治阶级都能变得“明智”和“仁慈”，只要农民阶级能接受统治者的“让步”政策，放弃暴力革命，就可以和封建统治阶级“合作”，建立“共同繁荣”的社会。
    翦伯赞从一九五九年以来，在极力鼓吹统治阶级“让步”的同时，还大肆宣扬阶级投降主义与活命的奴才哲学。在《应该替曹操恢复名誉》（《光明日报》一九五九年二月十九日）一文中，他竟然把起义农民比作“饿驴”，宣称：新王朝的封建统治者恩赐人民一束干草的“让步”，就已“符合当时人民的愿望”。他说：“曹魏王朝对于农民来说，即使不是一包干草，而是一阵棒打”，但比起旧王朝来，“总是一阵轻的棒打”；反动的屯田措施，“对于当时农民来说，可能还是一束干草，虽然不是很好的干草”。如果用更直接更通俗易懂的语言来表达翦伯赞的意思，那就是说：人民的愿望是能“活命”就行，哪怕是奴颜婢膝，跪着哀求，还是挨“一阵棒打”。这简直是对革命农民最卑鄙的诬蔑！
    这种反动的论调，大量充斥于《纲要》中。如书中把南朝频繁的农民暴动没有汇合成大规模的农民战争的原因，十分荒谬地归结为由于当时农民能够“纷纷逃入私门为奴、客，或者托身寺院作白徒、养女，供僧俗地主奴役”，找到了“安身之所”，“获得一线生机”（第二册，第一○一页）。这等于说，在封建残酷剥削和奴役下的农民，只要象翦伯赞所说的有“一线生机”，能够“活命”，即甘愿拜在封建统治阶级的脚下，满足于卑躬屈节的奴隶般的生活，而不起来革封建地主老爷们的命。
    毛主席教导我们：人类阶级斗争的历史，存在两种逻辑：一切反动派的逻辑是“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”；人民的逻辑则是“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一四九○页——一四九一页）。这两种逻辑，是对人类阶级斗争历史的科学概括，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是指导当前伟大革命斗争，反对帝国主义、现代修正主义及各国反动派的思想武器。而翦伯赞却大唱反调，大肆吹捧统治者的“仁慈”，大肆宣扬活命的奴才哲学。他的这套反动观点是和现代修正主义的逆流相呼应的，是为右倾机会主义的反党反社会主义活动服务的。
      ＊  ＊  ＊
    任何反革命的复辟，都要先从意识形态方面着手。翦伯赞的《中国史纲要》，是资产阶级向我们进攻的一枝毒箭，是他们推行和平演变，复辟资本主义的重要工具。特别值得注意的是，这部《纲要》是大学的教材，它在那些没有或缺乏实际阶级斗争经验的青年学生中，已经产生了非常有害的影响。在史学界，这部书在传播修正主义的反动思想方面，也起了极其恶劣的作用。我们必须对这样反党反社会主义的大毒草给予彻底的揭露和批判。在这场社会主义的文化大革命中，我们必须彻底摧毁翦伯赞的反动史学理论。
