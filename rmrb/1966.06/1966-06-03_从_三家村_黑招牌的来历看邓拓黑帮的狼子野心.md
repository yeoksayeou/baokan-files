    From the Origin of the "Three-Family Village" Black Signboard, We Can See the Wild Ambitions of the Deng Tuo Gang
    Comrade Editor:
    The black den jointly opened by Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha is a viper's nest. By examining the origin of this black den's signboard – "Three-Family Village" – we can clearly see the reactionary nature of Deng Tuo and his gang.
    One dictionary says this: "Three-Family Village, a remote small village. Lu You's 'Village Drinking Showing to Neighbors': 'Accidentally losing the position of ten thousand households, I then age in a three-family village.'" I further checked Lu You's poem and found lines like "After seven years, traces of court life cease, fame does not reach the powerful; with a loyal heart, I think and discuss with poor friends"; "My ears burn, I want to sing, everyone be quiet"; "Who can be sent to support righteousness? One battle to cleanse the universe." I further consulted relevant history books and learned that Lu You was dismissed from office at the beginning of Emperor Guangzong's reign in the Song Dynasty and returned to his hometown in Shanyin. "Accidentally losing the position of ten thousand households, I then age in a three-family village," "After seven years, traces of court life cease, fame does not reach the powerful," indicating that this poem was written by Lu You seven years after being dismissed and returning home. "Think and discuss with poor friends," "One battle to cleanse the universe," indicating that Lu You was unwilling to spend his life in a mountain village and still wanted to exert his political ambitions, and wanted to rise up and fight together with those "poor friends" who had also been dismissed from office like him.
    In his article "On the Bourgeois Standpoint of 'Frontline' and 'Beijing Daily'," Comrade Qi Benyu exposed that Deng Tuo was a traitor, a rightist who had escaped the net, and was "dismissed" from "office" by the Party and the people in 1959. It seems that this anti-Party and anti-socialist element, who was accustomed to using ancient stories to satirize the present, named his black den "Three-Family Village" not because there were three "shareholders," but because he compared himself to Lu You, who had lost the "position of ten thousand households," encouraging those right-leaning opportunists who had been "dismissed" from "office" by the people to stage a comeback, attempting to "cleanse the universe in one battle," overthrow our socialist state, and carry out capitalist restoration.
    From here, we can clearly see the vicious intentions of Deng Tuo and his black gang.
    I want to warn Deng Tuo that your anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies will never succeed. We must completely smash your "Three-Family Village"!

### 从“三家村”黑招牌的来历看邓拓黑帮的狼子野心

    从“三家村”黑招牌的来历看邓拓黑帮的狼子野心
    编辑同志：
    邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙合伙开办的黑店，是个毒蛇穴。查一查这个黑店的招牌——“三家村”的来历，我们就可以清楚地看出邓拓一伙的反动本质。
    有一本词典是这样说的：“三家村，偏僻的小乡村。陆游《村饮示邻曲》：‘偶失万户侯，遂老三家村’。”我再查陆游的这首诗，发现诗里还有“七年收朝迹，名不到权门；耿耿一寸心，思与穷友论”；“耳热我欲歌，四座且勿喧”；“扶义孰可遣？一战洗乾坤”等句。我又进一步翻阅了有关的历史书，才知道陆游在宋朝光宗即位之初，被罢了官，回到山阴老家。“偶失万户侯，遂老三家村”，
  “七年收朝迹，名不到权门”，说明这首诗是陆游罢官回乡七年后写的。“思与穷友论”、“一战洗乾坤”，说明陆游不愿意终老山村，还要施展自己的政治抱负，而且要和那些同他一样罢了官的“穷友”们一同起来斗争。
    戚本禹同志在《评〈前线〉〈北京日报〉的资产阶级立场》一文中揭发，邓拓是一个叛徒，是一个漏网的右派，一九五九年被党和人民“罢”了“官”。看来，这一个惯于借古讽今的反党反社会主义分子，把自己开的黑店起名为“三家村”，决不是因为有三个
  “股东”的缘故，而是把自己比做失去“万户侯”的陆游，鼓励那些被人民“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子东山再起，妄图“一战洗乾坤”，推翻我们的社会主义江山，实行资本主义复辟。
    从这里，可以清楚地看到邓拓这伙黑帮的恶毒用心。
    我要警告邓拓，你的反党反社会主义的阴谋诡计，是绝不会得逞的。我们一定要彻底捣毁你们的“三家村”！
