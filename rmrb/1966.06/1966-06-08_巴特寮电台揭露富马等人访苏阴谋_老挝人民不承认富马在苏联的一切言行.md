    (Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 7th) Pathet Lao Radio broadcast a commentary saying that Prince Phouma and the so-called Minister of Public Health and Acting Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism, Tiao Souk Saisombat, who accompanied him on his visit to the Soviet Union, "are not representatives of the Lao people." Their "every word and action in the Soviet Union is worthless," and "the Lao people completely do not recognize them."
    Prince Phouma and Tiao Souk Saisombat accompanied the King of Laos, Sisavang Vatthana, on a visit to the Soviet Union from May 15th to June 5th. During the visit, Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mazurov, received Prince Phouma and Tiao Souk Saisombat on May 16th and held talks with them. According to reports, Tiao Souk Saisombat, upon returning to Vientiane, made a speech at the airport saying that because the Soviet revisionist leading group gave "strong support" to the pro-American reactionary authorities in Vientiane's "neutral policy," the Soviet Union and the Vientiane authorities were even more "united, friendly, and understanding."
    The Pathet Lao Radio commentary pointed out that the purpose of Prince Phouma and Tiao Souk Saisombat accompanying the King of Laos, Sisavang Vatthana, to visit the Soviet Union was nothing more than to try their best to disguise themselves as legitimate state administrators. "However, a crow is still a crow, after all. A crow cannot become a peacock."
    The commentary pointed out that the current so-called Vientiane government is not the past tripartite national unity government. Because it has neither implemented the principles of the action program unanimously adopted by the three Lao parties in Zurich and the Plaine des Jarres, nor has it safeguarded the peace and neutrality of Laos, nor has it safeguarded the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laotian question. It has also colluded closely with the American puppet states and become a powerful tool for the United States to carry out its war of aggression against Laos. Therefore, it has no legal status and is merely a puppet, unable to represent the Lao people. Therefore, every word and action of Prince Phouma and Tiao Souk Saisombat in the Soviet Union is worthless, and the Lao people completely do not recognize it.
    The commentary concluded: "It is indeed ridiculous for cunning people to pretend to be legitimate. No matter how hard they try, they cannot hide their true colors as running dogs of U.S. imperialism and their actions that bring disaster to the country and the people."

### 巴特寮电台揭露富马等人访苏阴谋  老挝人民不承认富马在苏联的一切言行

    巴特寮电台揭露富马等人访苏阴谋
    老挝人民不承认富马在苏联的一切言行
    据新华社康开七日电　巴特寮电台发表评论说，富马亲王和同他一起访问苏联的所谓公共卫生大臣和代理新闻、宣传和游览大臣泰·乔銮科“都不是老挝人民的代表”，他们在苏联的“一切言行都毫无价值”，“老挝人民完全不承认。”
    富马亲王和泰·乔銮科是陪同老挝国王西萨旺·瓦达纳在五月十五日到六月五日访问苏联的。在访问期间，苏联部长会议第一副主席马祖罗夫在五月十六日接见了富马亲王和泰·乔銮科，并且同他们进行了会谈。据报道，泰·乔銮科在回到万象之后在飞机场上发表谈话说，由于苏联修正主义领导集团对万象亲美反动当局的“中立政策”给予“有力的支持”，苏联同万象当局更加“团结、友好和谅解”。
    巴特寮电台的评论指出，富马亲王和泰·乔銮科随同老挝国王西萨旺·瓦达纳去苏联访问的目的，不外是极力想把自己装扮成为合法的国家管理者。“但是，乌鸦毕竟仍然是乌鸦，乌鸦不能变成孔雀。”
    评论指出，目前的所谓万象政府并不是过去的三方民族团结政府。因为它既没有实现老挝三方在苏黎世和查尔平原所一致通过的行动纲领的原则，也破坏了老挝的和平与中立，破坏了一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，它还同美国的仆从国家紧密地勾结在一起，变成美国对老挝进行侵略战争的有力工具。因此，它是没有合法地位的，仅仅是一个傀儡，不能代表老挝人民。因此，富马亲王和泰·乔銮科在苏联的一切言行都毫无价值，老挝人民完全不承认。
    评论最后说：“奸狡之徒要冒充合法的人确实可笑。不管他们怎样努力，都是无法掩盖他们充当美帝国主义的走狗和他们的祸国殃民的面目的。”
