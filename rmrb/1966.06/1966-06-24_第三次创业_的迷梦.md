Title: The Delusion of "Third Founding"

    The reactionary trend of thought of militarism has greatly spread in Japan in recent years. Such reactionary fallacies as "affirmation of the Greater East Asia War," "theory of a rich country and a strong army," "Emperorism," "loyalty to the emperor and patriotism," "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and "Third Founding" are rampant. Fascist "authorities" have emerged one after another. Even photos of the militarist war criminal Hideki Tojo have appeared in textbooks. Remnants of militarism have erected "comfort spirits towers" and "loyal soul monuments" for war criminals executed in the past. Japanese monopoly capital groups have set up altars on a large scale, trying to bring back the "Yamato spirit" of militarism. Evil winds are raging and demons are dancing wildly. This is a major sign that Japanese militarism is stepping up its full-scale revival.
    After World War II, Japan saw an unprecedented vigorous national democratic revolutionary movement. The forces of Japanese militarism suffered a heavy blow. However, with the support of U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism quickly revived. In particular, since the Sato government came to power, it has more nakedly followed U.S. imperialism, accelerated the arms race and war preparations, actively pieced together military alliances, resolutely opposed the Chinese people and the Asian people, and while frantically expanding abroad, it has more blatantly promoted fascism at home, and attempted to pave the way for sending troops abroad one day through small constituency systems and constitutional amendments. The Japanese reactionaries deeply understand that if they want to retrace the old path of aggression of Japanese militarism, they must first carry out public opinion preparation and rebuild their so-called "spiritual pillar" of militarism to poison the minds of the people. The Japanese reactionaries' vigorous promotion of militarist ideology is to prepare spiritual conditions for the resurgence of Japanese militarism and its so-called "Third Founding."
    Countless historical facts have proved that all reactionaries are never reconciled to their defeat. As long as there is a glimmer of possibility, they will revive and attempt to reappear on the historical stage, until they are completely eliminated. Japanese militarism is the same. Although it suffered a disastrous defeat in World War II, it is absolutely impossible to learn true historical lessons, and it still wants to retrace the old path of foreign aggression. This is entirely determined by the reactionary nature of Japanese militarism.
    Chairman Mao told us that reactionary remnants "will never admit their failure. This is because they need not only to deceive others, but also to deceive themselves, otherwise they cannot live." Japanese militarists today still want to create a kind of superstition, that is, the path of aggression of the militarists can be followed, and the new hegemony of the Japanese militarists can be realized. They call Japan's outward expansion after the Meiji Restoration the "First Founding." The so-called "Greater East Asia War" is the "Second Founding." And now, they have begun their ambitious "Third Founding."
    Then, what basis do the Japanese militarists have to make people believe that their "Third Founding" will not repeat the disastrous mistakes of the past? They say yes. That is, the reason for the past failure was that they sided with the German and Italian fascists. When Germany and Italy were defeated, Japanese imperialism also perished. Today, they believe that if they rely on U.S. imperialism, the situation will be completely different. Their historical lesson seems to be: the reliance on the past was the wrong choice. Now, as long as they closely follow U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism will surely relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
    However, these remnants of Hideki Tojo are conceiving too beautifully.
    This reactionary trend of thought stirred up by the Japanese rulers in Japan will absolutely not be able to stop the torrent of the Japanese people's progress. The Japanese people have awakened today. After twenty years of struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, their consciousness has been greatly improved. National democratic revolution is the mainstream in Japan today, representing progress and the direction of historical development; while the militarists are just a countercurrent, representing reaction and historical retrogression. The mainstream is irresistible. The remnants of Japanese militarism, along with its various reactionary trends of thought, will eventually be sent to the garbage heap of history by the great Japanese people.
    Especially today's China is fundamentally different from China in the 1930s. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a great force against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries and defending Asian and world peace. The existence of a powerful socialist China is an insurmountable obstacle to the external expansion of Japanese militarism.
    Everyone can see clearly that U.S. imperialism is already trapped in the heavy encirclement of the Asian people and the people of the world, and like a clay idol crossing a river, it cannot even save itself. Japanese militarists failed in the past when they relied on German and Italian fascists, and they will fail even more miserably today when they rely on U.S. imperialism. The Japanese militarists are blindly trying to realize the delusion of the "Third Founding," which can only make them be smashed to pieces once again in the face of the bronze walls and iron walls of the Asian people. There can be no other outcome.

    “第三次创业”的迷梦
    何卓
    近几年来，军国主义的反动思潮，在日本大为泛滥。什么“大东亚战争肯定论”、“富国强兵论”，什么“天皇主义”、“忠君爱国”，什么“大东亚共荣圈”、“第三次创业”等等反动的谬论，甚嚣尘上。法西斯主义的“权威”纷纷出笼。甚至在教科书上也出现了军国主义战犯东条英机的相片。军国主义的余孽为昔日被处死的战犯大立“慰灵塔”、“忠魂碑”。日本垄断资本集团大肆设立祭坛，力图把军国主义的“大和魂”招回来。妖风狂作，群魔乱舞，这是日本军国主义加紧全面复活的重大标志。
    第二次世界大战以后，日本出现了前所未有的蓬蓬勃勃的民族民主革命运动。日本军国主义势力遭到了沉重的打击。但是，在美帝国主义扶植下，日本军国主义又迅速地复活起来。特别是佐藤政府上台以后，更加赤裸裸地追随美帝国主义，加速扩军备战，积极拼凑军事联盟，坚决与中国人民和亚洲人民为敌，疯狂地向外扩张的同时，在国内则更加露骨地推行法西斯化，并且企图通过小选举区制和修改宪法，为有朝一日派兵出国铺平道路。日本反动派深深地懂得，要重走日本军国主义的侵略老路，它就必须首先搞舆论准备，重建他们军国主义的所谓“精神支柱”，来毒化人民群众的心灵。日本反动派大肆宣扬军国主义思想，就是为日本军国主义的东山再起，为它的所谓“第三次创业”准备精神上的条件。
    无数历史事实证明，一切反动派决不甘心自己的失败。只要还有一丝一毫的可能，它们就要死灰复燃，妄图在历史舞台上再次粉墨登场，直到被彻底消灭为止。日本军国主义也是这样。尽管它在第二次世界大战中已经遭到惨败，可是它绝不可能吸取真正的历史教训，仍然要重走对外侵略的老路。这完全是日本军国主义的反动本性所决定的。
    毛主席告诉我们，反动余孽“是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子”。日本军国主义者今天仍然要制造一种迷信，即军国主义者的这条侵略老路，是能够走得通的，日本军国主义者的新的霸业是能够实现的。他们把明治维新以后的日本向外扩张称之为“第一次创业”。所谓“大东亚战争”是“第二次创业”。而现在，他们开始了野心勃勃的“第三次创业”。
    那末，日本军国主义者有什么根据可以使人相信，他们的“第三次创业”不致重蹈以前惨败的覆辙呢？他们说，有的。这就是，过去之所以失败，是由于他们投靠了德、意法西斯，德、意战败，日本帝国主义也就跟着完蛋。而今天，他们认为投靠了美帝国主义，情况就会完全不同了。他们的历史教训似乎是：过去的靠山选择错了，现在，只要紧紧追随美帝国主义，日本军国主义就必能重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。
    可是，这些东条英机的余孽们未免设想得太美妙了。
    日本统治者在日本掀起的这一股反动思潮，绝对阻挡不住日本人民前进的洪流。日本人民今天已经觉醒。他们经过二十年来同美日反动派反复斗争的锻炼，觉悟已经大大提高。民族民主革命是今天日本的主流，代表着进步和历史发展的方向；而军国主义者不过是一股逆流，代表反动和历史的倒退。主流是不可抗拒的。日本军国主义者的余孽，连同它的形形色色的反动思潮，终将被伟大的日本人民送进历史的垃圾堆。
    特别是今天的中国，同三十年代的中国已经根本不相同了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，是反对帝国主义和各国反动派、保卫亚洲和世界和平的伟大力量。强大的社会主义中国的存在，是日本军国主义对外扩张的不可逾越的障碍。
    谁都看得清楚，美帝国主义已经陷于亚洲人民和世界人民的重重包围之中，泥菩萨过江，自身难保。日本军国主义者过去投靠德、意法西斯失败了，今天投靠美帝国主义必将失败得更惨。日本军国主义者瞎着眼睛，妄想实现“第三次创业”的迷梦，只能使他们在亚洲人民的铜墙铁壁面前，再一次碰得粉身碎骨。除此以外，不可能有别的结局。
