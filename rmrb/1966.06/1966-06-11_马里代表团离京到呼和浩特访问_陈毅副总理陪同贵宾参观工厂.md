    Xinhua News Agency, June 10th. The Malian delegation led by Mamadou Madeira Keita, Political Bureau Member of the Sudanese Union-RDA and Malian Minister of Justice, left Beijing by plane this morning to visit Inner Mongolia, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and others.

    As the Malian guests bid farewell to the welcoming crowd, people waved colorful flags, ribbons, and bouquets amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, shouting slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Malian people!" and "Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!"

    Officials from the Malian Embassy in China also went to the airport to see them off.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 10th. The Malian delegation led by Mamadou Madeira Keita, Political Bureau Member of the Sudanese Union-RDA and Malian Minister of Justice, arrived in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, by plane this morning, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi.

    Vice Chairmen of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Wang Yilun and Shen Xinfa, Acting Secretary-General of the Inner Mongolia People's Committee Lu Zhihao, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office Deligeer, Acting Deputy Mayor of Hohhot Yun Zhian, and other responsible persons warmly welcomed the Malian guests at the airport.

    This afternoon, the Malian guests, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and Wang Yilun, visited the Inner Mongolia Veterinary Biological Pharmaceutical Factory and the Inner Mongolia No. 2 Wool Textile Factory, and were warmly welcomed by male and female workers of various ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, and Korean. Both factories were built with the spirit of self-reliance after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the equipment in the factories was all manufactured by our country. The biological pharmaceuticals produced by the Inner Mongolia Veterinary Biological Pharmaceutical Factory can not only supply the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with the various biological pharmaceuticals needed for livestock disease prevention and control, but also supply some pharmaceuticals to fraternal provinces (regions), and a small amount can also be exported. The raw materials used by the Inner Mongolia No. 2 Wool Textile Factory are a large amount of down produced in the autonomous region. After the Malian guests visited the Inner Mongolia No. 2 Wool Textile Factory, they wrote an inscription in the factory's guestbook, which read: "The delegation of the Republic of Mali pays tribute to the male and female workers and the female director, and congratulates them on making significant contributions to the construction of new Inner Mongolia and China's socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Long live the great new China's Inner Mongolia! We wish the great new China's Inner Mongolia prosperity!" (Attached picture)

    马里驻中国大使馆官员也到机场欢送。
    新华社呼和浩特十日电  由马里苏丹联盟党政治局委员、司法部长马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔率领的马里代表团，在国务院副总理陈毅陪同下，今天上午乘飞机到达内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市。
    内蒙古自治区副主席王逸伦、沈新发，内蒙古人委代秘书长鲁志浩，外事处处长德力格尔，呼和浩特市代副市长云治安等负责人，到机场热烈欢迎马里贵宾。少先队员向贵宾献了花。
    同机到达呼和浩特的，还有马里驻中国大使吉塞·提迪亚尼。
    今天晚上，内蒙古自治区副主席王逸伦设宴欢迎马里贵宾。宴会结束后，贵宾们观看了内蒙古草原上的文艺轻骑兵——“乌兰牧骑”演出的节目。
    今天下午，马里贵宾由陈毅副总理和王逸伦等陪同，参观了内蒙古兽医生物药品制造厂和内蒙古第二毛纺织厂，受到了两个厂的蒙古、汉、回、满、达斡尔、朝鲜等民族男女职工的热烈欢迎。这两个厂都是在一九五八年大跃进以后，各族人民高举毛泽东思想红旗，以自力更生精神兴建起来的，工厂的设备都是由我国自己制造的。内蒙古兽医生物药品制造厂生产的生物药品，不但可以供应内蒙古自治区牲畜疫病防治所需要的各种生物药品，部分药品还可供应兄弟省（区），少量药品还可出口。内蒙古第二毛纺织厂所用的原料是自治区生产的大量绒毛。当马里贵宾参观内蒙古第二毛纺织厂后，在工厂的留言簿上题词留念，题词中说：“马里共和国代表团向男女职工和女厂长致敬，并祝贺他们在英明的中国共产党的领导下和伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在建设新的内蒙古和中国社会主义建设事业中，做出重大的贡献。伟大的新中国的内蒙古万岁！祝伟大的新中国的内蒙古繁荣。”（附图片）
