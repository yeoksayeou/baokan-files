    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th. A mass rally and demonstration of 200,000 people was held in Pyongyang on June 24th to mark the 16th anniversary of the Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War (June 25th), demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.
    Korean Party and government leaders Kim Il, Pak Kum-chol, Ri Hyo-sun and others attended the rally.
    Kim Il-yong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, spoke at the meeting. He said that the victory of the Korean Fatherland Liberation War was a victory of the revolutionary people over the reactionary forces of imperialism and a victory of the revolutionary army over the armed forces of imperialist aggression. This historic victory clearly shows that as long as the liberated people take up arms, unite and resolutely fight against the imperialist aggressors, they can defeat any enemy.
    In his speech, he sternly condemned the barbaric crimes of US imperialism in continuing to occupy South Korea and frantically carrying out activities to expand armaments and prepare for war. He said that today, US imperialism has not only completely turned South Korea into its aggressive military base, but also turned South Korea into a base for supplying cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that US imperialism not only instructed Japanese militarism and the Park Chung-hee clique to sign the "South Korea-Japan Treaty," turning South Korea into a dual colony of the US and Japanese reactionaries, but also recently instructed its puppets to hold a so-called "Ministerial Conference of the Asian and Pacific Region" in Seoul, attempting to cobble together a new "anti-communist military alliance" against the Asian people.
    He said that Japanese militarism, revived with the support of US imperialism, has once again become an aggressive force threatening peace and security in Asia and the world, and we must resolutely chop off the aggressive claws of Japanese militarism.
    After strongly condemning the Park Chung-hee clique for betraying the country and the nation, he said that the South Korean people must unite as one, and in order to drive out the US aggressors, to chop off the aggressive claws of Japanese militarism, and to realize the cause of national reunification, they must carry out the anti-American and national salvation struggle more tenaciously.
    In his speech, Kim Il-yong also strongly condemned the policies of aggression and war pursued by US imperialism around the world.
    He said that the Korean people have made all preparations, and if US imperialism dares to carry out new military adventures, then it will surely be completely buried on the soil of Korea.
    Hwang Won-bo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Agricultural Workers' Union, Hong Sun-kwon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Socialist Working Youth League, and Kim Ok-sun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, also spoke at the meeting.
    A letter of appeal to the South Korean people was adopted at the meeting.
    A large-scale mass demonstration was held after the meeting.
    Along the way, the demonstrators angrily shouted: "Down with US imperialism!" "US imperialism get out of South Korea immediately!" "Resolutely fight for the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland!" The demonstration lasted for more than an hour.
    Mass rallies and demonstrations were also held in the capitals of each province of Korea.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th. The "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on June 25th, marking the 16th anniversary of the Korean Fatherland Liberation War (June 25th), saying that the Korean people are determined to drive the American aggressors out of South Korea and realize the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland. No matter when or under what circumstances US imperialism dares to launch a war, we will wipe them out in one fell swoop.
    The editorial said that sixteen years ago, the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea. With the support of the people of socialist countries and the revolutionary people of the world, and with the combat support of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people won the historic victory of the Korean War, gloriously defended the honor of the motherland, and made a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world.
    The editorial said that the historic victory won by the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War exposed the fragility and decadence of US imperialism. It clearly shows that the power of the people who hold sovereignty in their own hands is invincible.
    The editorial pointed out that now, US imperialism has not only failed to draw due lessons from the disastrous defeat in the Korean War, but on the contrary, continues to forcibly occupy South Korea and plot new schemes of aggression.
    The editorial condemned US imperialism for trampling on the Korean Armistice Agreement; carrying out war provocation activities in South Korea; instructing Japanese militarism and the Park Chung-hee clique to sign the "South Korea-Japan Treaty," and directing its puppets and vassal states to convene the "Seoul Conference" and other criminal activities.
    The editorial called on all working people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army in the northern half of Korea to raise revolutionary vigilance more than ever in the face of the active plotting by US imperialism and its lackeys to provoke a new war; must hold the sickle and hammer in one hand and the gun in the other, promote socialist construction, and further consolidate the revolutionary base politically, economically, and militarily; make the entire territory a steel fortress; must steadfastly defend the front lines of the motherland with a constant posture of tension and mobilization.

    平壤二十万人集会要求美军立即滚出南朝鲜
    金曰龙警告美帝如果胆敢进行新的军事冒险必将被彻底埋葬在朝鲜
    《劳动新闻》社论强调指出：朝鲜人民决心赶走美国侵略者实现祖国的自主统一
    新华社平壤二十五日电  平壤市二十万群众二十四日就朝鲜人民祖国解放战争十六周年（六月二十五日）举行集会和示威游行，要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朝鲜党政领导人金一、朴金喆、李孝淳等出席了集会。
    朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长金曰龙在会上讲了话。他说，朝鲜祖国解放战争的胜利，是革命人民对帝国主义反动势力的胜利，是革命军队对帝国主义侵略武装力量的胜利。这一历史性胜利清楚地说明，解放了的人民只要手持武器，团结起来同帝国主义侵略者进行坚决斗争，就能够战胜任何敌人。
    他在讲话中严厉谴责了美帝国主义继续霸占南朝鲜和疯狂进行扩军备战活动的野蛮罪行。他说，今天，美帝国主义不仅把南朝鲜完全变成它的侵略性军事基地，而且把南朝鲜变成侵越战争的炮灰供应基地。他说，美帝国主义不仅指使日本军国主义和朴正熙集团签订了“韩日条约”，使南朝鲜沦为美日反动派的双重殖民地，而且不久前还指使它的傀儡在汉城举行了所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”，企图拼凑反对亚洲人民的新的“反共军事同盟”。
    他说，在美帝国主义支持下复活起来的日本军国主义，今天重新成为威胁亚洲和世界和平与安全的侵略势力，我们必须坚决斩断日本军国主义的侵略魔爪。
    他在强烈谴责朴正熙集团出卖国家和民族的罪行后说，南朝鲜人民必须团结一致，为赶走美国侵略者，为斩断日本军国主义的侵略魔爪，为实现祖国统一事业，更加顽强地展开反美救国斗争。
    金曰龙在讲话中还强烈地谴责了美帝国主义在世界各地推行的侵略政策和战争政策。
    他说，朝鲜人民已作好了一切准备，如果美帝国主义胆敢进行新的军事冒险，那么，它就必将被彻底地埋葬在朝鲜的土地上。
    朝鲜农业劳动者同盟中央委员会委员长黄元宝、朝鲜社会主义劳动青年同盟中央委员会委员长洪淳权和朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会委员长金玉顺也先后在会上讲了话。
    会上通过了给南朝鲜人民的号召书。
    会后举行了大规模的群众示威游行。
    示威者沿途愤怒地高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义立刻从南朝鲜滚出去！”“坚决为实现祖国的自主统一而斗争！”示威游行历时一个多小时。
    朝鲜各道的首府也举行了群众大会和示威游行。
    新华社平壤二十五日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》二十五日就朝鲜祖国解放战争十六周年（六月二十五日）发表社论说，朝鲜人民决心把美国侵略者从南朝鲜赶出去，实现祖国的自主统一，不管美帝国主义在什么时候、在什么情况下，胆敢发动战争，我们将一举消灭它们。
    社论说，十六年前，美国侵略者发动了侵朝战争。朝鲜人民在社会主义国家人民以及全世界革命人民的支持和中国人民志愿军的战斗支援下，取得了朝鲜战争的历史性的胜利，光辉地维护了祖国的荣誉，为亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    社论说，朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中取得的历史性的胜利，暴露了美帝国主义的脆弱性和腐朽性，它清楚地表明，把主权掌握在自己手中的人民，其力量是无敌的。
    社论指出，现在，美帝国主义不但没有从朝鲜战争的惨败中吸取应有的教训，相反，继续强占南朝鲜，策划新的侵略阴谋的活动。
    社论谴责了美帝国主义践踏朝鲜停战协定；在南朝鲜进行战争挑衅活动；指使日本军国主义和朴正熙集团签订“韩日条约”以及指使其傀儡和仆从国家召开“汉城会议”等罪恶活动。
    社论号召朝鲜北半部全体劳动人民和人民军全体官兵，在美帝国主义及其走狗积极策划挑起新战争的情况下，必须比任何时候都要提高革命警惕；必须一手拿镰刀和锤子，一手拿枪，促进社会主义建设，从政治、经济、军事方面进一步巩固革命基地；使整个国土都变成一个钢铁堡垒；必须以经常的紧张动员姿态坚强地保卫祖国的防线。
