    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa – Over one thousand two hundred non-detached-from-production veterinary epidemic prevention personnel among the Tibetan emancipated herdsmen of the northern Tibetan grasslands are actively serving pastoral production and are welcomed by the herding masses.

    In the old society, these veterinary epidemic prevention personnel suffered deeply from the oppression of the three major feudal lords and were regarded as "livestock that could talk." After the Democratic Reform, under the education of the Party, they broke with the various superstitious ideas and outdated customs and habits left over from the feudal serf system. With the help of Han Chinese animal husbandry and veterinary personnel, they tenaciously studied veterinary epidemic prevention knowledge while herding livestock, becoming the first generation of new people on the grasslands to have a preliminary grasp of scientific knowledge. Once an epidemic occurred on the grasslands, they immediately entered the epidemic area to prevent and treat livestock, and because they had a clear understanding of the situation and acted quickly, the results were great. In the current season of lush grass, livestock beginning to shed their winter coats, and fattening up, they carry medicine bags and medical equipment on their backs, holding the works of Chairman Mao, and go wherever they are needed, becoming an important force in epidemic prevention on the grasslands.

    The Tibetan veterinary epidemic prevention personnel regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions. After studying articles such as "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," they are not afraid of difficulties in their work, love their class brothers, and are extremely responsible for their work. Last winter and this spring, when the Nagqu Special District encountered heavy snow, they stepped through knee-deep snow, braving the bitter cold of minus thirty to forty degrees Celsius, and traveled throughout many ranches, ensuring that livestock received timely prevention and treatment. They also frequently spread scientific knowledge and methods for preventing livestock epidemics to their herding brothers, broke feudal superstitious ideas, and helped many herdsmen abandon old ideas and old habits.

    千余名翻身牧民活跃在藏北草原  热情工作战胜困难防治牲畜疫病
    新华社拉萨电　藏北草原藏族翻身牧民中一千二百多名不脱产的兽疫防治人员，积极为牧业生产服务，受到了牧民群众的欢迎。
    这些兽疫防治人员在旧社会都深受三大领主压迫，被视为“会说话的牲畜”。民主改革后，他们在党的教育下，打破了封建农奴制度遗留下来的种种迷信思想和陈规陋习，在汉族畜牧兽医工作人员的帮助下，一面跟着畜群放牧，一面顽强地学习兽疫防治知识，成为草原上第一代初步掌握科学知识的新人。一旦草原上发生疫情，他们立即进入疫区为牲畜进行防治，因为情况明，行动快，收效也大。在目前水草丰茂、牲畜开始换毛、抓膘的季节里，他们背着药包和医疗器械，揣着毛主席著作，哪里需要就奔赴哪里，成为草原上一支重要的兽疫防治力量。
    藏族兽疫防治人员们把毛主席的书当作最高指示，他们学习了《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》等文章后，在工作中不怕困难，热爱自己的阶级兄弟，对工作极端负责。去冬今春那曲专区遇到大雪时，他们踏着没膝的积雪，冒着零下三四十度的严寒，跑遍许多牧场，使牲畜得到了及时的防治。他们还经常向牧民兄弟传播科学知识和防治牲畜疫病的办法，破除封建迷信思想，帮助许多牧民抛弃了旧思想和旧习惯。
