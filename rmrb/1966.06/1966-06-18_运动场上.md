    On the Sports Field
    The first stage of the 1966 National Volleyball Championship, held amidst the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, concluded on the 12th after eleven days of fierce competition in the Nanjing competition zone. The Shanghai men's and women's volleyball teams both secured first place.
    During the competition, athletes, referees, and staff, with full political enthusiasm, joined local workers, peasants, and soldiers in refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of black gang members like Deng Tuo and Kuang Yaoming.
    Throughout the entire competition process, athletes, referees, and staff from various regions paid attention to highlighting politics and studying Chairman Mao's writings, treating them as the highest directives. After the competition, the championship's political department, while organizing technical training and teaching demonstrations, also organized experience exchange meetings for studying Chairman Mao's writings.
    When organizing the competition, this zone arranged 70% of the matches in grassroots units such as military units, universities, and middle schools. More than 100,000 people watched the matches. Because the teams adhered to the spirit of "playing volleyball is playing politics" in the matches, new people, new events, and new customs emerged one after another, receiving enthusiastic praise from the audience.

    The 1966 National Shooting Competition in the Chengdu competition zone, which began on June 1st, concluded on the 13th. During the competition, five athletes broke four national records. In the twelve individual and team events, the People's Liberation Army team won nine first places; the Liaoning, Beijing, and Jiangxi teams each won one first place.
    More than 200 athletes from over twenty provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and the People's Liberation Army, participating in this competition, actively participated in the Socialist Cultural Revolution with revolutionary passion and class hatred on their way to Chengdu and during the intense competition, angrily denouncing the towering crimes of all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
    This shooting competition was a competition that highlighted politics, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings, and compared thoughts, will, and style. Athletes from ten fraternal ethnic groups participating in the competition united together and commanded the competition with Mao Zedong Thought. They carried Chairman Mao's books with them, and wherever they were, whether at their residence or at the shooting range, one could see scenes of enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's writings. Ma Zemin, an athlete from the Guizhou team, has made rapid progress since studying Chairman Mao's writings this year, working hard on the "application" aspect. He participated in the men's free rifle competition and, together with his teammates, constantly summarized and advanced victoriously, breaking three national records in a row.
    The 1966 National Shooting Competition is divided into two competition zones. The competition in the other zone—the Jilin competition zone—will be held later. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    运动场上
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中举行的一九六六年全国排球锦标赛第一阶段南京赛区的比赛，经过十一天的激战在十二日结束。上海男、女排球队都获得了第一名。
    在比赛期间，运动员、裁判员、工作人员以饱满的政治热情，和当地工农兵群众一道驳斥邓拓、匡亚明等黑帮分子的反党反社会主义罪行。
    在整个比赛过程中，各地运动员、裁判员、工作人员注意突出政治，学习毛主席著作，把毛主席著作当作最高指示。比赛结束后，锦标赛的政治处在组织技术训练教学观摩的同时，还组织了学习毛主席著作的经验交流会。
    这个赛区在组织竞赛时，把百分之七十的比赛场次安排在部队、大中学校等基层单位进行。有十多万人观看了比赛。由于各代表队在比赛中本着“打球就是打政治”的精神，新人新事新风尚层出不穷，受到观众的热烈赞扬。

    从六月一日开始举行的一九六六年全国射击竞赛成都赛区的比赛，已经在十三日结束。比赛期间，共有五名运动员打破了四项全国纪录。在十二个单项团体比赛中，解放军代表队获得了九项第一名；辽宁、北京、江西代表队各获得一项第一名。
    参加这次比赛的二十多个省、市、自治区和解放军代表队的二百多名运动员，在前来成都的途中，在紧张的比赛期间，满怀革命激情和阶级仇恨，积极参加社会主义文化大革命，愤怒声讨一切反党反社会主义分子的滔天罪行。
    这次射击竞赛，是一次突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作，比思想、比意志、比风格的竞赛。参加比赛的十个兄弟民族的运动员团结在一起，用毛泽东思想统帅比赛。他们把毛主席的书带在身旁，不管在住地，在靶场，到处都可以看到热烈学习毛主席著作的景象。贵州代表队运动员马泽民今年大学毛主席著作以来，在“用”字上狠下功夫，进步很快。他参加男子自选小口径步枪比赛，和同伴们一道不断总结，乘胜前进，一连打破了三项全国纪录。
    一九六六年全国射击竞赛共分两个竞赛区，另一个赛区——吉林赛区的比赛将在晚些时候举行。　（据新华社）
