    Editor's Note: The contradictions between imperialist countries are developing rapidly, and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc is already on the verge of collapse. Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thesis that imperialist groups are increasingly heading towards disintegration has once again been vividly confirmed.
    The North Atlantic Group, like other aggressive blocs cobbled together by US imperialism, is both a tool for aggression against socialist countries and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and a tool for controlling its allies. This inevitably arouses opposition from the people of all countries and causes struggles between the United States and its allies.
    The uneven development of imperialist countries has further intensified the struggle between the United States and its "allies" over control and anti-control. In particular, the upsurge of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the serious setbacks in the United States' aggressive activities in these regions, have greatly reduced the territory of imperialist countries, and the contradictions and struggles between them are bound to become more and more intense.
    Currently, the imperialist camp is undergoing a process of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. Amid the disintegration within the imperialist camp, US imperialism is intensifying its efforts to strengthen control over its allies in order to prevent the collapse of the North Atlantic Group and maintain its hegemonic position within this aggressive bloc. But all these efforts are clearly futile. On the contrary, US imperialism's various manipulative practices can only provoke more intense opposition from other imperialist countries, thereby accelerating the complete collapse of the North Atlantic Group.

    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. A reporter from this agency reports: The spring meeting of the North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council opened today in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. This meeting is being held at a time when France has decided to withdraw from the US-controlled military "integration" organization, thereby causing an unprecedented major crisis within the group, and at a time when the alliance is fragmented and the United States is in an isolated position.
    US Secretary of State Rusk, in a speech upon arriving in Brussels, admitted that never before had so much “preparation been done” for a North Atlantic Group Council meeting. Preparation work actually began in March. At that time, as soon as the United States learned of France’s decision, it convened a meeting of fourteen allies without French participation and established several working groups to study countermeasures. Later, the United States sent important officials such as Deputy Secretary of State Ball to lobby in Western Europe. Recently, Washington authorities also held talks with British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Thomson, West German Defense Minister Hassel, and Belgian Foreign Minister Harmel respectively. After arriving in Brussels, Rusk also seized the opportunity on the 5th to hold talks with the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Group and the foreign ministers of the Netherlands, Canada, West Germany, Greece, Britain, and Italy, and convened a fourteen-nation meeting on the eve of the meeting in an attempt to squeeze out a unified plan at the last moment to deal with France at the Council meeting on the 7th.
    It is not surprising that the United States is so distraught over the North Atlantic Group issue. This military group was established by the United States after World War II, taking advantage of the extremely weakened political, military, and economic strength of Western European countries. It is a tool for the United States to carry out expansion abroad and control its allies at home. The so-called military "integration" is a means to achieve the above-mentioned goals and is the soul of this aggressive alliance. In recent years, due to the relative strengthening of Western Europe’s strength, the great decline in the United States’ power and status, and due to the Soviet Union’s vigorous pursuit of a capitulationist policy of "Soviet-US cooperation," and its large-scale "detente" with the United States in Europe, Western European countries, especially France, feel that the North Atlantic Group has lost its basis for existence, and their centrifugal tendency towards the United States is becoming stronger and stronger. The United States' attempt to use the North Atlantic Group to drag its allies into the Vietnam War and then "contain" China has further strengthened France's determination to get rid of US control, not willing to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. Under these circumstances, France, taking advantage of the opportunity that the United States' strategic focus has shifted eastward and is mired in the Vietnam War, unable to look westward, demanded a thorough reorganization of the North Atlantic Group, and then unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the group's military "integration" organization, and demanded that US troops and bases withdraw from France, which has pushed the crisis of this alliance to a new stage.
    France's actions fundamentally shook the United States' hegemony in Western Europe and shocked the entire North Atlantic Group. It not only militarily bisected the north and south regions of Western Europe, losing depth, but also politically fueled the development of centrifugal tendencies in other allies. Although countries currently express their intention to continue to maintain the incomplete North Atlantic Group, they all want to take advantage of this turbulent reorganization opportunity to gain more benefits for themselves. A struggle of intrigue and mutual deception is intensifying among the so-called allies. The imperialist camp is in a state of chaos.
    For several months, a fierce struggle has unfolded between the United States and France. On the one hand, the United States has adopted high-handed tactics, attempting to assemble a fourteen-nation anti-French "united front" to isolate France, and threatening to withdraw the nuclear warheads supplied to the French forces stationed in West Germany, preventing France from using the North Atlantic Group’s radar warning network, and demanding that France pay "relocation fees" for US and North Atlantic Group military facilities, and so on. On the other hand, seeing that France was not to be coerced, it adopted a "delay and wait" strategy, requesting that the deadline for the withdrawal of US troops and bases be extended by one year, while inciting public opinion in Western European countries to oppose French President de Gaulle and encouraging French politicians who oppose de Gaulle, attempting to influence the French National Assembly elections next spring and hoping for changes within France that are unfavorable to de Gaulle. The French side is using "quick battles and quick resolutions" to deal with the United States' "delay" tactics, striving to complete the main steps of withdrawing from the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" organization according to the established timetable before the general election next spring, in order to strengthen the position of the de Gaulle faction in the parliamentary elections. The New York Times admitted that the results of the French National Assembly's foreign policy debate in late April showed that de Gaulle's decision to sever ties with the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" organization not only did not weaken his position but strengthened it.
    After France's decision to withdraw, West Germany's position in Western Europe and the North Atlantic Group became more pivotal and more relied upon by the United States. On the other hand, West Germany still needs France, whether politically, economically, or militarily, and it is not in West Germany's interest to lean completely towards the United States. France's actions just "checkmated" West Germany, forcing West Germany to show who it was going to follow, a choice that West Germany had been trying to avoid for many years. West Germany's recent attitude towards the issue of French troops stationed in Germany fully illustrates West Germany's contradictory situation: on the one hand, for its own interests and to cooperate with US pressure, it wants the French troops to accept some kind of disguised "integration" after withdrawing from the military "integration" command, as a condition for remaining stationed in West Germany; on the other hand, it fears that if more than 70,000 French troops really withdraw, it will leave an irreparable gap in West Germany militarily, and politically put West Germany's relationship with France in danger of breaking down, or at least lose the indispensable French support on the "German reunification" issue, which West Germany regards as its lifeline, and have to rely more on the United States, becoming more isolated in Western Europe. Therefore, after France adopted a tough attitude, West Germany immediately softened its stance and expressed its willingness to negotiate. Currently, under the planning of the United States, a five-nation committee of the United States, Britain, West Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands has been established, wanting to represent the fourteen countries in negotiating with France on the issue of French troops stationed in West Germany, in order to force France to make concessions with collective pressure. It is reported that France does not intend to negotiate with the five-nation committee, but is only willing to negotiate bilaterally with West Germany.
    Although Britain is actively following the United States, clamoring to maintain "integration," maintain alliance "unity," and oppose France, it is also afraid that West Germany's rise will replace its position as the second in command in the alliance, and therefore is quite dissatisfied with the United States' reliance on West Germany. In addition, it does not want West Germany to possess nuclear weapons, which it has in common with France; at the same time, in order to seek political and economic outlets in Western Europe, Britain has recently repeatedly reiterated its willingness to join the Western European "Common Market," and the key to entering the "Common Market" is in France's hands, so Britain cannot but consider its attitude towards France. And France, in order to confront the United States and restrain West Germany, is also frequently flirting with Britain. Currently, British rulers, who are accustomed to playing the "balance of power" strategy, are using the various contradictions between the US-France, France-West Germany, and within the North Atlantic Group to gain benefits for themselves.
    The struggle over the location of the future alliance headquarters was originally mainly between Britain and other allies, including the United States. Britain had advocated moving the Standing Council, currently located in Paris, to London, making Britain the political center of the alliance and playing a leading role in Western Europe. According to Western media reports, this plan was opposed by the United States, especially West Germany, which believed that Britain was located outside the Western European continent and would be difficult to play a leading role, and that doing so would make the North Atlantic Group seem more like a shop opened by the United States and Britain, increasing the dissatisfaction of Western European countries. In addition, West Germany also particularly opposed strengthening Britain's position, because it would be detrimental to its contention for hegemony in Western Europe. Under these circumstances, Britain had to abandon this plan and instead support the United States and West Germany, advocating moving the Council out of France and setting it up in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg region.
    Other allies, under US pressure, superficially had to declare that they would maintain military "integration," but their attitude was cautious, expressing that they would maintain good relations with France. They have fresh memories of Nazi crimes and are wary of the growth of West Germany's military and economic strength and the closer military and political ties between the United States and West Germany. Portugal and Turkey publicly expressed reservations about the fourteen-nation declaration on military "integration." On the issue of the site of the Standing Council, Italy, Canada, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Turkey, and Portugal all opposed moving the Council out of France, so as to avoid breaking with France and causing serious consequences. Talking about this centrifugal tendency, US journalist Frankel had to admit that the general mood in Western Europe at the moment is to hope that the United States will exercise "restraint" and "slow down the pace" in its anti-French actions.
    Under these circumstances, how to maintain the incomplete, near-collapsing aggressive organization of the North Atlantic Group in order to stabilize the United States' foothold in Western Europe has become a problem that keeps the United States up at night. According to reports, the United States is brewing a plan to reorganize the North Atlantic Group so that this group can continue to exist. The United States hopes that the new plan can achieve a dual purpose: (1) Under the condition of continuing to maintain military pressure on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the North Atlantic Group will become a tool for "peaceful infiltration" into these countries, in order to promote their "peaceful evolution" and accelerate the restoration of capitalism; (2) Make some minor concessions to Western European countries in order to ease the dissatisfaction of the allies while maintaining US hegemony. It is precisely based on this spirit that US Secretary of State Rusk said in a speech on the 4th that he would ask the North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council to adopt a "long-term plan." He also said that this plan would "test whether the Kremlin is willing to end the Cold War." United Press International said that Rusk's move was also "an attempt to take action before de Gaulle begins his visit to Moscow on June 20."
    The United States is doing everything possible to maintain the disintegrating North Atlantic Group; however, due to the numerous and irreconcilable internal contradictions, this terminally ill group will further collapse, and the United States' hegemony in Western Europe will eventually be unsustainable. Faced with the situation within the group on the eve of the North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council meeting in Brussels, the British Sunday Telegraph could not help but lament pessimistically: "The alliance is divided from top to bottom," "The chaos has not stopped."

    Johnson and his aides lamented in front of the maps of Vietnam and the countries of the North Atlantic Group: There are problems in the East, and there are also problems in the West.

    北大西洋集团部长理事会揭开一场激烈斗争
    西方阵营加剧分裂　美法面临摊牌局面
    约翰逊政府高压手段失败力图改组北大西洋集团保住美国霸权
    编者按：帝国主义国家之间的矛盾正在急剧发展，北大西洋侵略集团已经濒于瓦解边缘。毛泽东同志关于帝国主义集团日益走向四分五裂的英明论断，又一次得到了生动的证实。
    北大西洋集团，同美帝国主义拼凑的其他侵略集团一样，一方面是侵略社会主义国家和亚非拉各国人民的工具，同时也是控制它的盟国的工具。这就必然引起各国人民的反对，引起美国和它的盟国的斗争。
    帝国主义国家发展不平衡，更加剧了美国同它的“盟国”之间的控制与反控制的斗争。特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的高涨，以及美国在这一地区侵略活动的严重挫败，大大缩小了帝国主义国家的地盘，它们之间的矛盾和斗争就必然要越来越激烈。
    目前，帝国主义阵营正在经历大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程。在帝国主义阵营内部分崩离析的局面下，美帝国主义变本加厉地采取加强控制的办法来对付它的盟国，以图防止北大西洋集团瓦解，维持它在这个侵略集团内的霸主地位。但是这一切努力，都显然是徒劳的。相反，美帝国主义种种纵横捭阖的做法，只能引起其他帝国主义国家更加猛烈的反对，从而加速北大西洋集团的彻底崩溃。
    新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：北大西洋集团部长理事会春季会议，今天在比利时首都布鲁塞尔开幕。这次会议，是在法国决定退出美国控制的军事“一体化”机构，从而在这个集团中引起空前大危机的时候举行的，是在联盟支离破碎、美国处境孤立的情况下举行的。
    美国国务卿腊斯克在到达布鲁塞尔的时候在谈话中承认，以前从来没有为一次北大西洋集团理事会会议“进行过这样大量的准备”。准备工作实际上从三月份就开始。当时，美国一得知法国的决定，就召集没有法国参加的十四个盟国会议，并且成立若干工作小组，研究对策。后来，美国又派了象副国务卿鲍尔这样重要的官员到西欧游说。最近，华盛顿当局又和英国协办外交事务国务大臣汤姆森、西德国防部长哈塞尔同比利时外交大臣阿麦尔分别举行会谈。腊斯克在到达布鲁塞尔以后在五日还抓紧机会先后同北大西洋集团秘书长以及荷兰、加拿大、西德、希腊、英国和意大利的外长会谈，并且在会议前夕召开十四国会议，企图在最后一刻挤出一个一致的方案，到七日的理事会会议上去对付法国。
    美国在北大西洋集团问题上之所以如此凄凄惶惶，是毫不奇怪的。这个军事集团是美国在第二次世界大战后利用西欧国家政治、军事和经济力量极大削弱的困境而建立的，它是美国对外实行扩张、对内控制盟国的工具。所谓军事“一体化”就是实现上述目的的手段，是这个侵略性联盟的灵魂。近年来，由于西欧的实力相对增强、美国的力量和地位大大下降，由于苏联大力推行“苏美合作”的投降政策，同美国在欧洲大搞“缓和”，西欧各国，特别是法国，感到北大西洋集团失去其存在依据，对美国的离心倾向越来越强烈。美国想利用北大西洋集团把盟国拉进越南战争，进而“遏制”中国，这就更加加强了不愿为美国火中取栗的法国摆脱美国控制的决心。在这种情况下，法国趁美国战略重点东移而又在越南泥足深陷，无暇西顾的时机，从要求北大西洋集团彻底改组、进而单方面宣布退出集团的军事“一体化”机构，并且要美国军队和基地撤离法国，这就把这个联盟的危机推到一个新的阶段。
    法国的行动从根本上动摇了美国在西欧的霸权，震撼了整个北大西洋集团。它不仅在军事上把西欧南北地区腰斩为二，失去纵深，而且在政治上助长了其他盟国离心倾向的发展。尽管各国目前还表示要继续维持残缺不全的北大西洋集团，但是，都想趁这个动荡改组的时机，多给自己捞点好处。一场勾心斗角、尔虞我诈的斗争，正在所谓盟国之间加紧进行。帝国主义阵营内部正陷于一片混乱之中。
    几个月来，美国和法国之间展开了剧烈的搏斗。美国一方面采取高压手段，企图纠合十四国组成反法“联合阵线”来孤立法国，并且威胁要收回供驻西德法军使用的核弹头，不让法国使用北大西洋集团的雷达警报网，并且要法国为美国及北大西洋集团的军事设施出“迁移费”等等。另一方面，看到法国不受要挟，就采取“拖延待变”的策略，要求把美军和基地撤退期限延缓一年，同时在西欧各国煽动舆论来反对法国总统戴高乐，鼓励法国国内反对戴高乐的政客，企图影响法国国民议会明春的选举，寄希望于法国内部发生不利于戴高乐的变化。法国方面则以“速战速决”来对付美国的“拖延”战术，力求在明春大选前按既定时间表完成退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构的主要步骤，以加强戴高乐派在议会选举中的地位。《纽约时报》承认，四月下旬法国国民议会外交辩论的结果说明，戴高乐要同北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构割断关系的决定不仅没有削弱他的地位，反而加强了他的地位。
    在法国决定退出后，西德在西欧和北大西洋集团中的地位更加举足轻重，也更加为美国所倚重。另一方面，西德无论是在政治、经济还是军事方面，都还需要法国，完全向美国一边倒，对西德不利。法国的行动正好“将”了西德的“军”，逼西德表明究竟跟谁走，而这是西德多年来竭力避免的抉择。最近西德对待法国驻军问题的态度，就充分说明了西德的矛盾处境：一方面为了自身的利益和配合美国的压力，要法军在退出军事“一体化”司令部后再接受某种变相的“一体化”，作为留驻西德的条件；另一方面，又怕七万多法军果真撤走，在军事上给西德留下难以弥补的缺口，在政治上使西德同法国的关系有陷于破裂的危险，至少是在西德看作命根子的“德国重新统一”问题上失去必不可少的法国的支持，而不得不更加依附美国，在西欧更加孤立。所以，在法国采取强硬态度以后，西德马上软下来，表示愿意谈判。目前，在美国策划下，已经成立美、英、西德、意大利、荷兰五国委员会，想代表十四国同法国谈判法军留驻西德问题，以便用集体压力迫使法国让步。据报道，法国不准备同五国委员会谈判，而只愿意同西德双边谈判。
    英国虽然积极追随美国，叫嚷要保持“一体化”，保持联盟“团结”，反对法国，然而又害怕西德崛起取代它在联盟中占第二把交椅的地位，因此对美国倚重西德颇为不满。另外，它不愿西德拥有核武器，这同法国有共同点；同时英国为了在西欧寻求政治、经济出路，最近一再重申愿意参加西欧“共同市场”，而进入“共同市场”的钥匙却握在法国手里，英国因此不能不考虑对法国的态度。而法国为了对抗美国、制约西德，也对英国频送秋波。目前，惯于玩弄“均势”策略的英国统治者正在利用美—法、法—西德之间以及北大西洋集团内部的各种矛盾，为自己捞取好处。
    围绕将来联盟总部所在地的斗争，原来主要在英国和包括美国在内的其他盟国之间进行。英国曾主张把目前设在巴黎的常设理事会迁往伦敦，使英国成为联盟的政治中心，在西欧起领导作用。据西方报界透露，这个计划遭到了美国、特别是西德的反对，它们认为，英国地处西欧大陆之外，难起领导作用，而且那样做会使北大西洋集团显得更象是美英两家开的店铺，增加西欧国家的不满。此外，西德还特别反对增强英国的地位，因为这不利于它争霸西欧。在此情况下，英国只好放弃这个打算，转而支持美国和西德，主张把理事会迁出法国，设在荷、比、卢地区。
    其他盟国在美国压力下，表面上不得不声明要保持军事“一体化”，但是态度谨慎，表示要同法国保持良好关系。它们对纳粹罪行记忆犹新，对西德军事、经济实力的增长和美国同西德在军事和政治上更加紧密的联系感到疑惧。葡萄牙和土耳其对十四国关于军事“一体化”的声明就曾公开表示保留。在常设理事会会址问题上，意大利、加拿大、希腊、丹麦、挪威、土耳其、葡萄牙都反对把理事会迁出法国，以免同法国决裂，造成严重后果。谈到这种离心倾向时，美国记者弗兰克尔不得不承认，目前西欧的普遍情绪是，希望美国进行“克制”，在反法做法上“放慢步调”。
    在这种情况下，如何维持住北大西洋集团这个残缺不全、濒于瓦解的侵略性组织以稳住美国在西欧的阵脚，就成了美国寝食不安的难题。据报道，美国正在酝酿一个改组北大西洋集团的方案，使这个集团能够继续存在下去。美国希望，新的方案能达到双重目的：（一）把北大西洋集团在继续保持对苏联和东欧的军事压力的条件下成为对这些国家进行“和平渗透”的工具，以促进它们的“和平演变”，加速资本主义复辟；（二）对西欧国家作一些微小的让步，以缓和盟国的不满，同时保住美国的霸权。正是根据这个精神，美国国务卿腊斯克在四日的一篇演说里说，他将要求北大西洋集团部长理事会通过一个“长期计划”。他还说，这个计划将“考验克里姆林宫是否愿意结束冷战”。合众国际社说，腊斯克这一手也是“企图在戴高乐六月二十日开始访问莫斯科前抢先采取行动”。
    美国千方百计要维持分崩离析的北大西洋集团；然而，由于内部矛盾重重，不可调和，这个病入膏肓的集团将会进一步土崩瓦解，美国在西欧的霸权终于是保不住的。面对着北大西洋集团部长理事会布鲁塞尔会议前夕集团内部的情况，英国《星期日电讯报》不禁悲观失望地发出感叹说：“联盟从上到下地分裂了”，“混乱并没有停息”。（附图片）
