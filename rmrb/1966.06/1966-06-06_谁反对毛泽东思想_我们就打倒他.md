    Whoever Opposes Mao Zedong Thought, We Will Strike Him Down
    Special-Class Merit Recipient, Former Battalion Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Battle of Shangganling, Yi Wenguang
    After hearing the Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee on the radio, I felt extremely excited. It completely reflects our inner desires. This is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Cultural Revolution movement, and a great victory for the domestic struggle against revisionism!
    The former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, engaged in heinous anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, attempting to carry out "peaceful evolution" in our country and drag China onto the path of revisionism. They were the decision-makers of the "Three-Family Village" black gang's anti-Party program, and the command headquarters of the "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," which have long served as tools for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. They extended their clutches to units such as Peking University, promoting a bourgeois education line, attempting to cultivate young people into successors of the bourgeoisie. All facts show that the leadership of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee was permeated with a black anti-Party and anti-socialist line, a bridgehead for the restoration of capitalism, and a stumbling block to the socialist cultural revolution.
    We believe that under the leadership of the newly reorganized Beijing Municipal Party Committee, the erroneous line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee and its influence will certainly be thoroughly eliminated.
    We are proletarian revolutionary fighters, and we listen to Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is our sharp weapon for defeating all enemies. Whoever opposes our beloved Chairman Mao and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how senior, how high his position, or how great his reputation, we will resolutely strike him down! Wherever there are monsters and demons, we will chase after them; wherever the black line extends, we will dig it out, resolutely defending the Party Central Committee and defending Mao Zedong Thought!

    谁反对毛泽东思想　我们就打倒他
    特等功臣、前中国人民志愿军参加上甘岭战斗营长　宜文光
    我从广播里听到党中央改组北京市委的决定后，心中非常兴奋。它完全反映了我们内心的愿望。这是毛泽东思想在文化大革命运动中的新胜利，是国内反对修正主义斗争的伟大胜利！
    前北京市委打着红旗反红旗，大搞反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，妄想在我国搞“和平演变”，把中国拉上修正主义的道路。他们是“三家村”黑帮反党纲领的决策者，是长期充当反党反社会主义工具的《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》的指挥部。他们把魔爪伸到北京大学等单位，推行资产阶级的教育路线，妄图把青年培养成资产阶级的接班人。一切事实表明，前北京市委的领导贯穿着一条反党反社会主义的黑线，是复辟资本主义的桥头堡，是社会主义文化大革命的绊脚石。
    我们相信，在新改组的北京市委的领导下，前北京市委的错误路线和它的影响，一定能够被彻底肃清。
    我们是无产阶级的革命战士，我们最听毛主席的话。毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们战胜一切敌人的锐利武器，谁要反对我们敬爱的毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，不管他资格多老，职位多高，名声多大，我们都要把他坚决打倒！哪里有牛鬼蛇神，我们就往哪里追，黑线伸到哪里，我们就挖到哪里，坚决保卫党中央，保卫毛泽东思想！
