    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Bangkok on the 3rd, the Indonesian right-wing military regime is actively participating in activities to assemble an anti-communist alliance according to the intentions of U.S. imperialism. Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Adam Malik announced in Bangkok on the 2nd that his government and "Malaysia," the Philippines, and Thailand have agreed to participate in an organization called the "Cooperation Alliance of Southeast Asian Nations." He said that the Deputy Prime Minister of "Malaysia," Razak, the Foreign Minister of the Philippines, Ramos, and he have "been considering" establishing this "Cooperation Alliance." He said that the suggestion to establish this organization was put forward by Indonesia.

    The so-called "Cooperation Alliance of Southeast Asian Nations" that the Indonesian right-wing military regime is participating in assembling is an American product. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, a military aggression organization cobbled together by U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, has long been paralyzed due to its disintegration. The United States has long wanted to reassemble other organizations to replace it. The "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" composed of Thailand, "Malaysia," and the Philippines, and the "Maphilindo" which was once intended to be composed of "Malaysia," the Philippines, and Indonesia, were such replacements. However, these organizations were paralyzed or disintegrated at the beginning due to internal and external factors. After the Indonesian right-wing military clique seized power, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, activities to assemble a Southeast Asian anti-communist alliance became more active. At the same time as the Indonesian right-wing military group and "Malaysia" announced "reconciliation and cooperation," the Philippines and "Malaysia" issued a communique on the 2nd announcing that both sides would "strengthen" relations, "agree to upgrade their respective consular institutions to the ambassadorial level," and "enable the two countries to expand regional cooperation by restoring the activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations." Malik also said in Bangkok on the 2nd that with the consent of Thai Foreign Minister Khoman, "Maphilindo" will be expanded.

    印尼右派为美帝拼凑反共集团效劳
    积极拉拢“马来西亚”和泰菲建立新东南亚联盟
    据新华社三日讯　曼谷消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在积极按美帝国主义的意图参与拼凑反共联盟的活动。印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长阿达姆·马利克二日在曼谷宣布，它的政府和“马来西亚”、菲律宾、泰国已经同意参加一个叫做“东南亚国家的合作联盟”的组织。他说，“马来西亚”副总理拉扎克、菲律宾外交部长拉莫斯和他“一直在考虑”成立这个“合作联盟”。他说，成立这个组织的建议是由印度尼西亚提出的。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在参加拼凑的所谓“东南亚国家的合作联盟”，是一个美国货。美帝国主义在东南亚拼凑的军事侵略组织东南亚条约组织由于分崩离析而长期陷于瘫痪状态。美国早就想重新拼凑别的组织来代替它。由泰国、“马来西亚”和菲律宾组成的“东南亚国家联盟”和一度打算由“马来西亚”、菲律宾和印度尼西亚组成的“马—菲—印尼”，都是这样的代替物。但是，这些组织由于内部和外部的因素，在一开始就陷于瘫痪或瓦解。在印度尼西亚右派军人集团夺取政权之后，在美帝国主义的指使下，拼凑东南亚反共联盟的活动又趋积极。在印度尼西亚右派军人集团和“马来西亚”宣布“和解合作”的同时，菲律宾和“马来西亚”二日发表公报宣布双方“加强”关系，“同意把它们各自的领事机构升格到大使级”，并且要“使两国有可能通过重新恢复东南亚国家联盟的活动来扩大区域合作。”马利克二日在曼谷也说，由于泰国外交部长科曼的同意，“马—菲—印尼”将扩大。
