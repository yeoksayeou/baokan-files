Editor's Note: Today is International Children's Day, June 1st. Our newspaper has selected a chapter from the novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai" depicting the childhood of the great communist fighter Ouyang Hai. This chapter is a microcosm of the evil old society. It tells people to remember the bitterness of class and never forget the tears of blood.

Children living in the Mao Zedong era have not experienced the suffering of Little Hai. Liu Da Dou, Pan Baochang, and their backers have been defeated by us, but this does not mean that the class struggle no longer exists. The landlord class and the bourgeoisie are not reconciled to being eliminated. They dream of restoration at all times, dreaming of regaining their past golden world of cannibalism. Why did the "Three Family Village" black shop of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, and all the demons and monsters, so frantically attack the Party, attack socialism, and attack our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao? The reason is very clear. This is to clear the way for the restoration of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, to make China regress to that dark age. Children, we must, like Ouyang Hai in his lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be good children of Chairman Mao, take over the revolutionary cause, resolutely fight against all demons and monsters, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

Chapter One In the Wind and Snow

I. Naming

The Chunling River bypasses Guiyang County and flows north in a hurry, passing through gorges and valleys, and flowing into the azure Xiang River. Behind it, it leaves a barren and poor land: the Guiyang Mountains. The northeast of the mountainous area is an undulating hilly area, and the southwest is the towering Nanling Mountains. On a hilltop with many stones and little land, and thick sand and thin soil, live more than a dozen poor families, who have been sprinkling sweat on the stingy land for generations. Here, the soil is harder than elsewhere, the stones are more numerous than elsewhere, and sweat is worth less than elsewhere... People contemptuously call this poor mountain village "Old Crow's Nest."

On the twenty-third day of the tenth lunar month in 1940, the dark sky was tightly fastened to the top of the mountain. On the plains, early winter had just arrived, but the Old Crow's Nest was already bitterly cold. Several gray-white clouds swept in from the northwest, unwilling to leave around the top of the mountain. The clouds spread down along the back of the mountain, and the mountainous area was hidden in a haze. Several old crows, flapping their wings, hurriedly returned to their nests from outside the sky, leaving a desolate croaking sound on the mountain. At dusk, snowflakes swirled and quietly rushed towards the Old Crow's Nest. Heavy snow dyed the roof white, covered the field ridges, and blocked the mountain road. The white Old Crow's Nest had no sound except the howling north wind. People huddled next to their fire pits dozing off - this is how every winter is spent!

In the north of the village, in front of the small house made of stones and earth, there is a small pine seedling that has just emerged from the soil, which is being torn left and right by the north wind. The finger-thick trunk is struggling in the wind and snow. It looks like the small pine seedling is afraid it won't survive. Inside the house, firewood and grass blackened the mud walls on all sides. A dim oil lamp was placed in a hole in the wall, and the yellow flame flickered weakly. A slight groan came from the bed, and Ouyang Hengwen's wife was in labor. The north wind mixed with snowflakes squeezed in from the cracks in the wall and the gaps in the thatched roof. A thin layer of snowflakes accumulated on the bed and the mosquito net pieced together with patches, and the cold went straight to the bone marrow. Ouyang Hengwen, the head of the family in his forties, sat by the fire pit in a daze. Excessive physical labor and the unbearable burden of life weighed him down, bending his back and filling his face with wrinkles. He added a handful of firewood to the fire pit, looked back at his groaning wife on the bed, and thought to himself:

"...Another mouth to feed! Three fen of paddy fields and 1.8 fen of dry land, how can I support this family of five... How will we live next year, how will we survive this winter! The heavens don't open their eyes, and this year it's so cold so early..."

"Dad! I'll go next door and ask Grandma Xing to come over." The second daughter, Yuying, said to her dazed father. Without waiting for an answer, she opened the door and ran out. A gust of wind squeezed in through the door and blew out the small oil lamp in the hole in the wall. The room was pitch black.

Ouyang Hengwen lit a pine torch in the fire pit and walked towards the oil lamp.

"Forget it, don't light the lamp and burn oil! It's probably not time yet today," the woman said on the bed.

"Saving up this lamp won't last through the winter!" Ouyang Hengwen said, still lighting the small oil lamp. He looked anxiously out the window, "Song Ya has been gone for so long, he should be back. If he can borrow some grain, you'll have something to eat during your confinement... Alas! He's twenty years old, and he's still so inept."

"Running is running in vain. Poor relatives and poor friends, where can you let him borrow? The suffering is that the sweet potatoes planted this year also suffered a severe drought, and there was no harvest. With this snow, even wild vegetables are afraid to be..."

The door was pushed open, and Yuying led Grandma Xing in. Grandma Xing looked at the woman with a sallow complexion in front of the bed, and turned to Ouyang Hengwen and said:

"It's all starting, and not even a basin of water has been boiled! Men should go out for a while."

Ouyang Hengwen came to the eaves and heard the woman humming one after another inside the house. The snow fell heavier and heavier. In a short while, Ouyang Hengwen's clothes were piled with snowflakes. He stood at the door like a log, his mind in a mess. Childbirth, raising a family, right now so poor that he can't even borrow, what will he use to fill his stomach and get through the winter! ... He held his two thick-calloused hands in front of his chest, and silently prayed in his mouth: "Our ancestors have lived in this mountain valley for generations, struggling hard to this day. Maybe in my hands, Hengwen, it will... I don't ask for gold, I don't ask for silver, I just hope that next year there will be more rain and a good harvest. Song Ya and I will work hard to throw a few more handfuls of sweat on the slope. Poor people have no land, strength is grain..."

A burst of rapid footsteps came from the entrance of the village, and Song Ya ran over breathlessly empty-handed.

"Dad, I'm chosen!" Song Ya said abruptly.

"Chosen for what?!"

"Drafted!"

"Drafted! What...what drafted?"

"Conscripted!"

"Ah!..." Ouyang Hengwen trembled all over, and subconsciously grabbed Song Ya.

"At noon, Pan Baochang opened the cabinet publicly at the township office. At first, he said that Liu Da Dou's second young master was chosen; Liu Da Dou sent someone to send a post, and Pan changed his mind and said that I won a 'superior' lot, and I was one of the top three!"

Ouyang Hengwen seemed to have been hit on the head, shaking and unable to stand steady. He understood that if Song Ya was taken away, even if the weather was good next year, who would do the work in the field? ... This is going to kill the whole family!

"Didn't they say...didn't they say 'only sons don't serve in the army'? Can the laws of those officials be changed and changed so easily!" Dad was so anxious that his tongue was stiff and he couldn't speak in sentences, "You...you don't know how to reason with them!"

"Law? This is a trick played by Pan Baochang and Liu Da Dou! He took someone else's envelope money and forced me to fill in the name of Liu's second young master."

"Don't be afraid, Song Ya, we're not afraid! 'Only sons don't serve in the army' is a law set by the higher-ups. If he, Pan Baochang, dares to do something unfair, I dare to sue him!" Dad bolstered himself, "I'll sue to the district, I'll sue to the county government, and I'm not afraid of him!"

"Dad!" Song Ya stomped his feet angrily,

"He, Pan Baochang, said that my mother is about to give birth. If she gives birth to a boy, then I am not an 'only son' and should be 'one of two drafted' according to the law!"

"What? Giving birth to a son means 'one of two drafted'!..." Ouyang Hengwen felt the sky spinning and the ground turning. The snowflakes that hit his face were like sharp knives piercing his heart. He shivered, felt half cold, looked up at the dim night sky, and kept mumbling in his mouth:

"'One of two drafted'... 'One of two drafted'..."

"Wah—wah—" The cry of a baby came from the house, crying so loudly and clearly.

"This..." The two of them were stunned by the sudden sound and stood straight in the snow.

The door opened, and the girl Yuying ran out quickly, shouting happily:

"Dad! Mom gave birth, it's a younger brother, it's a younger brother!"

Grandma Xing also poked her head out of the crack in the door:

"Congratulations, congratulations, she gave birth to a son! 'Double the males, prosperous days' ah. Come in and have a look."

"Thank you!" Ouyang Hengwen gave Grandma Xing a bitter smile and hurriedly turned his back. He tore at the front of his clothes, shouting in despair:

"The murderous heavens! 'One of two drafted' ah!..." He tried to lift his leg, but he couldn't move. The earth under his feet seemed to have cracked open, and he was falling down from this crack. Everything in front of him went black, he couldn't see anything, and his ears were filled with the sound of the whistling wind. He understood in his heart: This is falling into that abyss...

"Wah—wah—" The newborn baby cried vigorously in the dim thatched cottage. This child who shouldn't have been born, accompanied by severe cold, hunger and suffering, came into the world.

It was the second watch.

The house was quiet. The family sat around the fire pit, looking at you, you looking at me, no one said a word. The youngest son lay peacefully in his mother's arms.

The wind was still blowing, and the snow was still falling...

"Alas!" The mother on the bed sighed deeply. Her eyes filled with tears as she looked at her son in her arms, thinking about the events before and after. She shook her head and said helplessly, "There's no other way to think about it. See which family has the fortune to raise him, and send him over as soon as possible, lest..."

Dad interrupted her and said, "In these years of war, with the Kuomintang in power and the Japanese devils about to attack, and Liu Da Dou and Pan Baochang pressing for rent and people, who can afford to add another mouth!"

"Then..." the mother said with a crying voice,

"Then we can only take advantage of the darkness before dawn and throw him next to the Earth God Temple. ... Son, if your life is long, there will always be kind people who will take you back..."

"Mom!" Yuying cried and threw herself in front of her mother's bed, "Don't throw him away! ... If you want to throw someone away, you might as well sell me..."

"Second daughter!" Mother touched Yuying's head and said, "Selling you will still lead to 'one of two drafted'! There's no way. It's not that your parents are cruel, just treat him as... just treat him as not a piece of flesh from my body..."

"Mom!" Song Ya shouted in a muffled voice. He wanted to say, "Draft me, draft me, I'll risk dying in the military district, but I can't let my younger brother..." Looking at his mother's face, he swallowed the words back.

"Son, it's getting late, you have to make a decision quickly!" Mother urged.

Ouyang Hengwen was sitting there in a daze with his hands holding his head. He had heard everything that was said just now. But what decision could he make? Throwing him to the Earth God Temple would mean he would freeze to death before dawn; not throwing him would mean Song Ya would be drafted, and who would the whole family rely on? Leaving the little son at home would only mean starvation! ... The whole family sat quietly. After an unknown amount of time, the crowing of a rooster came from the howling north wind.

"Son, it's almost dawn, if you're going to take him out, take him out quickly!"

Dad sat still. Mother held the child in her hands and said:

"Song Ya! Come, you take your brother... out."

"I won't!" The older brother didn't move with his head down.

"I'll do it!" Dad suddenly stood up, "We can't let him starve the whole family to death!" He trembled all over, walked forward and took the child from his wife's hands, slowly walked to the oil lamp, squinted his eyes, and looked at his newborn youngest son through tears: a red face, a head of black hair, not even opening his eyes. "Alas!..." He gritted his teeth and walked towards the door.

"Dad..." Song Ya and Yuying grabbed the hem of Dad's clothes and knelt down and shouted:

"Dad!..."

Dad ignored them. Yuying turned her head and looked at her mother on the bed:

"Mom! You, you didn't see, it's snowing outside!..."

Mother hurriedly turned her back, biting her clothes tightly, tearing her hair with both hands. Soft sobs came from the bed.

Ouyang Hengwen felt a pang of sadness. His legs felt like they weighed a thousand pounds. Holding his son in his arms, how could he step over the threshold in front of him! Thinking of the days to come, he stomped his feet and shouted, "Let go of your hands!" Then he opened the door.

A gust of cold wind mixed with snowflakes poured in through the door, and the son in his arms woke up, crying "Wah".

This cry, like a steel needle, pierced the mother's heart, and she shouted:

"You..."

Ouyang Hengwen stopped and looked back at his disheveled wife.

"Wait, wait for me... to put another piece of clothing on him!" Mother said, taking the son over, taking off the cotton-padded coat patched with patches, carefully wrapping the son tightly.

"Wah—wah—" The youngest son kept crying. Mother hurriedly undid her clothes and put her nipple into his little mouth, and the room returned to calm. Mother stared at her son, holding him tighter and tighter, wishing she could pour all the milk, blood and love into her son in these few seconds. Suddenly, she pulled out her nipple and shouted madly, "Quick! Quick, take him!" She realized that her son couldn't stay in her arms anymore. In just a moment, the mother and son would never be able to separate...

Ouyang Hengwen carried his youngest son and staggered out the door. The snow hit his face, and a gust of wind blew off the worn felt hat on his head. He still walked forward in a daze. He was about to turn onto the road, but he couldn't find the small pine tree at the door. Looking closely, the small pine tree was deeply covered by heavy snow, leaving only a bunch of pine needles swaying in the north wind...

Ahead, the Earth God Temple stood at the crossroads like a white grave mound. The temple door, like a dark mouth, was about to swallow the father and son. Ouyang Hengwen came to the front, and freed one hand to dust off the snow on the incense table, gently put down the son in his arms, and turned back.

The youngest son lay silently on the incense table. Maybe he would fall asleep peacefully and never wake up again.

Two shrill barks of dogs tore through the silent snowy night, and the youngest son kicked his little legs and cried. These cries dragged Ouyang Hengwen's footsteps and awakened him as if from a nightmare... This was the seventh child. Four of the first six died of cold and starvation, leaving only Song Ya and Ying Meizi. How much heartache and tears had their parents suffered for those children who couldn't survive! ... Now, the son came, and he personally threw him into the snow...

"Is this my own sin, or is the heavens going to cut off the offspring of my Ouyang family?" He looked back at the Earth God Temple, "What am I doing? I'm confused! I'm personally burying a living son in the snow!" Looking at the Earth God Temple, looking at the heavy snow, he couldn't help but return to his little son. ...

Mother fell on the bed, listening to the sound of footsteps outside the door disappear in the wind and snow. Her heart felt like it was being cut with a knife. This was taking away her heart and liver, digging away the flesh from her body! It's not easy to be pregnant for ten months. It's hard to let the son fall to the ground, and then watch him be thrown away. The more she thought about it, the more she regretted it, the more her heart ached. She only felt a salty taste in her mouth, and endless tears were flowing into her stomach!

"No! ... No! ... This murderous 'one of two drafted' ah!" Mother howled. She fell off the bed and crawled to the door with difficulty...

Suddenly, as if a gust of wind pushed open the two broken doors, Ouyang Hengwen ran back tightly holding his son:

"Drafting is drafting, arresting is arresting, we will die in a pile! My son is innocent, I can't throw him out. I can't!"

The whole family was stunned when they saw Dad running back with the child. No one could say a word. The mother knelt on the ground, stretched out her arms, her lips trembling, and finally squeezed out a sentence:

"Dad, quick, quick, quick give him to me!" She picked up the son as if she had picked up a treasure, quickly tore open her clothes, and pressed the child tightly to her heart.

The wind was still blowing, and the snow was still falling...

A few days later, the snow had just stopped, and Boss Pan came to the mountain. Seeing Pan Boss heading straight for the thatched hut from afar, the whole family was flustered. Ouyang Hengwen hurried to greet him.

"Hengwen! I heard that you have another son in your family. I'm busy with official duties and haven't come to congratulate you!" Boss Pan said, about to step into the door.

"Boss Pan, we are poor families, and giving birth to children is also a disaster! The house is small and dirty, and there is no place to set foot." Ouyang Hengwen blocked the door.

"It doesn't matter. We officials don't care about these things. Now is the time of the War of Resistance, and the 'New Life' movement is being promoted again. Chairman Chiang has stipulated that pedestrians should walk on the left!" Boss Pan pushed Hengwen away with his civilized cane, about to step in when a hand pulled him from behind.

"Boss! You can't enter a woman's confinement room. 'New Life' or old life, it's all the same. Getting tainted with blood will bring bad luck for a lifetime!" Grandma Xing smiled and pulled Boss Pan, "You officials pay attention to fame and fortune. If it really delays your glory and wealth, the Hengwen family can't afford it. Let's go to my house to talk." Saying that, she half-pulled and half-pushed Boss Pan to her own home.

"Hengwen!" Boss Pan got straight to the point. "Your family's Song Ya won a 'superior lot', and it was opened publicly in front of everyone. The liaison chief was also there that day. Alas, even though you and I are from the same village, I, Pan, can't help. I can't find a temple to worship."

Ouyang Hengwen stood there in a daze, opening his mouth but not speaking.

Grandma Xing handed over a bowl of tea and said, "Boss, didn't I hear that 'only sons don't serve in the army'?"

Boss Pan smiled and said: "Yes, 'only sons don't serve in the army' is the law set by the higher-ups. But didn't Hengwen's wife give birth to another one a few days ago? This is called 'one of two drafted'. I am also handling official business!"

"Give birth to a son?" Grandma Xing deliberately curled her lips and said, "Hengwen's wife didn't cultivate this blessing in her previous life, and she will never have this life again!"

"What are you talking about?"

"Another girl, a money-losing thing."

"Really?" Boss Pan put down his teacup and stood up.

"I was the one who delivered her, so how can it be fake! If you don't believe me, we'll go over to that house to take a look."

"Grandma Xing, you woman can't talk nonsense. Now it's 'one family breaks the law, ten families are implicated'! If you know and don't report it, deceiving the government, you will be doubly punished!" Boss Pan threatened.

"I can't afford to break this law either. I'll bring him over for you to see." Grandma Xing turned and left. She thought in her heart: It's probably impossible to hide it by force; as long as I have the courage to bring him over, the Pan won't want to see him.

Soon, she really brought Hengwen's youngest son over.

"A dragon can't become a phoenix, and a phoenix can't become a dragon. You, Boss Pan, eat the official's rice. I'll let you take a good look to make a difference." Grandma Xing said, really starting to untie the child's broken swaddling clothes.

Ouyang Hengwen clenched his hands tightly, mustered up his courage and said, "Yes, it's good to take a look, so that Boss Pan won't believe it..."

"Ah!" Grandma Xing suddenly exclaimed,

"This dead girl, she peed all over herself again! Boss Pan..."

"Could it be that they passed on the wrong information?..." Pan thought to himself while glancing at the child out of the corner of his eye: a bag of bones and a piece of skin. He felt a wave of nausea in his heart and hurriedly waved his hand and said:

"Forget it, forget it!"

Grandma Xing still said with a smile, "Boss Pan, take a look, handle official business!"

"A girl is a girl, there's nothing to see." The Pan turned around and said to Hengwen, "'Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength'! The draft can be avoided, but you can't miss a single grain of the ten shih of grain for the conscription donation! The soldiers at the front are waiting for your grain to eat."

Pan Boss walked away with his civilized cane, and Ouyang Hengwen breathed a sigh of relief. He only felt his hands were ice-cold and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He felt like the bones in his body had fallen apart and collapsed on the ground.

"What are you squatting here for?"

"I...I..."

"Why don't you hurry up and give him a name and report it!" Grandma Xing handed the baby back to Hengwen and said.

The name had been chosen before the child was born. The old gentleman at the pharmacy had given it. The oldest was called "Song". If this born one was a boy, he would be given the single name "Hai", saying that "high mountains" need "water" to make the days prosperous, and the whole family would be auspicious. Ouyang Hengwen said:

"The name has been chosen, the nickname 'San San', the official name 'Ouyang Hai'."

"Ouyang Hai? Don't give him that name with 'Hai' or 'River'! Hide it to the end. I think we should give him a girl's name to report!"

"Then... what name is good?"

"Isn't his sister called Yuying, him, just call him 'Yurong'!"

"Ouyang Yurong?" Hengwen walked out the door holding his son, not knowing whether he was bitter or sweet in his heart. A son has to be given a girl's name, what kind of world is this!

"Wah—" Ouyang Yurong cried. A gust of cold wind blew in the face, blowing all the coldness of the world into the heart of this child who was not long born. Cold and hunger, like invisible ropes, tightly bound this young life.

"Wah—wah—" Ouyang Yurong waved his little hands and struggled. He shouted loudly, crying loudly, and the loud crying resounded throughout the remote Old Crow's Nest.

II. Starve to Death Rather Than Beg for Rice

The small pine tree in front of the door was almost as thick as a bowl, and Ouyang Yurong - Ouyang Hai was seven years old.

Two years ago, he heard that it was some kind of "victory," but the conscription was even more evil. Wealthy and powerful families, ten brothers and eight brothers didn't serve in the army; poor people who lacked salt and rice, even only sons were conscripted. It was useless to dress up as a girl. Little Hai had semi-long hair and wore a broken jacket left by his sister. He still watched helplessly as his eldest brother was tied up by Boss Pan with ropes and taken away. As soon as the eldest brother was escorted to the town, someone pressed him on a bench and shaved a "yin-yang head": half of his head had hair, and half was shaved bald, making him look neither human nor ghost - in this way, you can't fly even if you grow wings. Plus "ten-person guarantee" and "non-five no movement" - if you don't have five or seven people together, you are not allowed to go to the latrine even if you have to pee in your pants. Who would dare to run, who could run! When he arrested his eldest brother, Boss Pan didn't say "the country is in trouble," but said "suppressing the rebellion and building the country." Little Hai didn't understand these words! What he understood was that from that year on, his mother took his sisters and brothers out to beg for rice; the following year, his father went to another village to find work, and on New Year's Day, he came back empty-handed, carrying a pole. ... He still didn't know that his eldest brother had owed Liu Da Dou one hundred and twenty shih of grain in order to avoid those years of conscription, including the "conscription donation" and interest; he didn't know that Liu Da Dou and Pan Baochang saw that their family had no more oil to squeeze, so they tied up his eldest brother and sent him to "suppress the rebellion."

Hunger and disaster followed Little Hai's family like shadows.

It was another windy and snowy winter. The roof was white, and long icicles hung upside down from the eaves of the thatched roof, like fangs, like inverted sharp knives, to tear the people huddled in Old Crow's Nest to pieces. A gust of wind rose, and they howled along with it.

Little Hai's family of five - the eldest brother was taken away, and another younger sister was added to the family - were worried around the fire pit. It was time to be unable to make ends meet again.

Mother said, "I have worked hard in the fields all year round, and all the sweat has flowed into Liu's mansion! Alas!..." She sighed, "He Dad, staying in the house is not a solution, I will take them out to beg for some."

Dad lowered his head and did not speak. The older sister hurriedly found the begging basket and stick, and said:

"Let's go, Mom!"

Dad glared at his older sister, "Don't go! ... Such a big girl going out to beg for rice, people will laugh."

"Let them laugh. I'm not afraid!" The older sister argued.

"You're not afraid?" Dad wanted to lose his temper but held it back, turned to Mom and said, "The girl is not young anymore, if she goes out to beg for rice again... who will come to propose marriage! We can't ruin her for life."

"I..." the older sister with tears in her eyes, looked at her mother, "Mom! I... I will follow you when I am old..."

Mom's eyes also turned red: "Ying Meizi, you will be nineteen and eating twenty's rice after the New Year, you can't..."

The older sister cried and hid in the corner of the door. Mom sighed, patted Little Hai's head and said, "San San, let's go."

Yuying stuffed the begging basket and stick into her younger brother's hand, and tears fell down. She looked at her mother and said:

"Mom, leave the fourth sister at home, she is only a month old, and it is snowing so heavily outside!"

Mom handed the fourth sister to Yuying, thought for a while, and then hugged her over.

"Hold her, it's easier to beg with her. Otherwise, who will give alms?" After Mom finished speaking, she led San San out the door.

The older sister hurried to the door and shouted: "San San, tell Mom to go early and come back early!"

It was snowing heavily, where to beg! The poor families in Old Crow's Nest couldn't afford to give alms; to beg for rice, you have to go to the market. Today's market is in Shatang, more than forty li back and forth. After walking a few steps, Mom turned her head and said: "San San, let's go to Lianxi today, it's closer there."

There are two black spots slowly moving on the top of Old Crow's Nest Mountain: Mom is walking in front holding the fourth sister; Little Hai with semi-long hair, still wearing his sister's purple-red broken jacket, tightly following Mom's clothes.

Two lines of footprints were left on the pure white snow: Mom's footprints were deeper; Little Hai was only seven years old, his footprints were shallow, but five toes were clearly printed on them. The footprints spread from Old Crow's Nest to Lianxi, a full fifteen li.

A gust of wind blew, and layers of snow particles swirled behind the mother and son. The footprints were gradually covered by snow. ...

In Lianxi Town, every family closed their doors, and there was not a single pedestrian on the street. Mom led Little Hai into the street. In front was Liu Da Dou's Liu Family Mansion: red doors and high walls, with many paintings on the walls, all of which were wealthy people, some playing chess, some riding horses. Little Hai often thought, "Why don't they beg for rice?" There was also a pair of stone lions squatting at the door, grinning. Every time Little Hai passed by here, he always wanted to touch them with his hands. The lion's mouth also contained a ball. Little Hai always wanted: "If I could ride on the lion's back, that would be great!" ... When they were about to reach the Liu Family Mansion, about to see the stone lions, Mom turned around and led Little Hai into a narrow alley.

"Mom! Walk along the street!" Little Hai wanted to see the lions.

"Can't go to the mansion. The dogs are fierce and the people are evil there."

"I..."

"Listen to me!" Mom patted the snowflakes on Little Hai's head and said, "There's begging here."

Little Hai stepped on his mother's footprints and turned into the alley, still looking back from time to time, wanting to see the pair of lions.

On Lianxi Street with dozens of shops, only one grocery store had put down its door panels, and a blacksmith's furnace was lit. The mother and son came to the door of a shop, and as soon as Mom stretched out her hand, the shopkeeper inside roared:

"Go away! Haven't opened for business today."

The mother and son wandered around the street for an hour or two, unable to find a place to open their mouths. Little Hai's bare feet were frozen red and swollen in the snow, and Mom was also walking around with dizzy eyes. She sat down under the eaves of a house and beckoned to the child beside her and said:

"San San, come over, let Mom warm your feet."

Little Hai leaned against Mom and put his pair of small feet, with cracks in the soles and backs, into Mom's arms. His feet were already frozen stiff. Mom touched the pair of cold feet and said in her heart:

"The children of rich families as big as him have worn out six or seven pairs of cotton shoes; our San San has been bare feet since he landed from his mother's womb..." She felt tight all over, and her internal organs ached as if they were being pulled by something.

Not knowing whether it was cold or hungry, the fourth sister in Mom's arms cried. Several mouthfuls of cold wind choked her and she couldn't catch her breath for a long time. The crying stopped and she kept spitting white foam. Mom was anxious and hurriedly pinched her philtrum, shouting madly:

"Fourth sister, fourth sister!..."

"Alas!" A sigh beside them, the blacksmith master across the street walked over with a bowl of boiled water and said, "Sister-in-law, you shouldn't be! In such wind and snow, dragging your children out to beg for rice! Today is not a market day, no one will give alms."

"We don't come out often, but there's no way, Master," Mom said, taking the boiled water.

"Coming out is also suffering. Go, go to my stove to warm up."

The three of them followed the blacksmith master to the stove. After a long time, the fourth sister finally recovered and cried again with her little mouth open. Mom undid her clothes and put her shriveled nipple into her mouth. The fourth sister sucked hard. Mom gritted her teeth and frowned. Every time the fourth sister sucked, the corner of Mom's mouth trembled... This burst of pain passed from Mom's face to Little Hai's heart. He knew that Mom had no milk. The fourth sister couldn't suck out any milk and let go of her nipple and cried loudly. Mom rubbed her chest hard, wanting to squeeze out half a drop of milk to feed the child. But the mother who couldn't even get enough chaff and vegetables to eat couldn't squeeze out any milk. The fourth sister kept crying...

The pain on Mom's face and the fourth sister's hoarse crying were like knives cutting the flesh in Little Hai's heart. He felt a pang of sadness and couldn't help but shout:

"Mom!..."

Mom looked at Little Hai in surprise: "What's wrong with you? Are you hungry?"

"No, I'm not hungry."

The blacksmith master standing next to him walked over and said, "Sister-in-law, I am also a half-hungry person. Alas! There is no way." Saying that, he turned over a sweet potato from the stove and handed it to Mom.

Mom was embarrassed to disturb others again, said "Thank you" and hurriedly led Little Hai away. When she reached the street, she put the sweet potato in Little Hai's hand: "San San, you eat it."

"Mom, you eat it."

"Listen to me! Eat it while it's hot and go back first."

"Mom, you go back first! I'll come back after I beg for a bite or two."

Mom felt that she was a little uncomfortable today, and her eyes were dizzy. The fourth sister in her arms had cried her throat hoarse. It seemed that she couldn't beg for anything else. She told Little Hai: "San San, you go to the poor families to beg, don't go to the wealthy families! Be careful of the dogs."

"I know."

"Come back early!" Mom put half a piece of broken sackcloth over Little

    欧阳海之歌
    金敬迈
    编者按：　今天是“六一”国际儿童节，本报选载了长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》描写共产主义伟大战士欧阳海童年时代的一章。这一章，是万恶的旧社会的一个缩影。它告诉人们，要牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇。
    生活在毛泽东时代的孩子们，没有小海这样的苦难经历。刘大斗、潘保长以及他们的靠山已经被我们打倒了，但是，这绝不等于阶级斗争已经不存在了。地主阶级和资产阶级是不会甘心被消灭的。他们时时刻刻梦想复辟，梦想夺回他们过去吃人的黄金世界。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的“三家村”黑店和一切牛鬼蛇神，为什么那样猖狂地攻击党、攻击社会主义、攻击我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席呢？道理很明白，这是为了要给地主阶级、资产阶级复辟扫清道路，要使中国倒退到那个黑暗的年代去。小朋友们，我们一定要象欧阳海生前一样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子，一定要接好革命的班，坚决同一切牛鬼蛇神作斗争，把社会主义革命进行到底！
    第一章　风雪中
    一、起名
    春陵河绕过桂阳县，急急忙忙地向北流去，穿峡出谷，注入碧蓝碧蓝的湘江；在它的身后，留下了一块荒凉贫瘠的土地——桂阳山区。山区的东北边是起伏不平的丘陵地带，西南面就是高耸入云的南岭山脉了。在一块石多地少、沙厚土薄的山顶上，集居着十来户贫苦人家，世世代代向吝啬的地里洒着汗水。这儿，土比别的地方硬，石头比别的地方多，汗水比别的地方更不值钱……人们鄙弃地把这个穷山村称作“老鸦窝”。
    一九四○年阴历十月二十三，乌沉沉的天紧紧扣在山顶上。平地上初冬刚至，老鸦窝早已是严寒逼人了。从西北方刮来几团灰白色的云彩，绕着山尖不肯离去，云层顺着山背漫下来，山区隐没在一片雾霭中。几只老鸦，扑打着翅膀，匆匆忙忙自天外归巢，山上留下了一片凄凉的呱呱声。上灯时分，雪花打着旋儿，静悄悄地向老鸦窝扑来。大雪染白了屋顶，盖满了田塍，遮断了山路。白茫茫的老鸦窝，除了呼呼的北风外，没有一点声响。人们蜷缩在自家的火塘旁边打瞌睡——哪一个冬天都是这么熬过来的！
    村子北边，那间石头和土块儿垒成的小屋门前，有一棵刚刚出土的小松苗，正被北风撕扯得左右乱晃，指头般粗的树干正在风雪中挣扎。看样子，小松苗怕是活不成了。屋子里边，柴草把四壁土墙熏得漆黑，墙洞里搁着一盏昏昏不明的小油灯，黄色的火苗有气无力地跳动着；床上传来几声轻微的呻吟，欧阳恒文的女人临产了。北风夹着雪花从墙缝中、从茅草屋顶的隙罅里挤了进来。床上、补钉连成片的蚊帐上，都积下一层薄薄的雪花，寒意直透骨髓。四十来岁的当家人欧阳恒文，坐在火塘旁边发呆。过重的体力劳动和挑不起的生活重担，压得他腰弯背驼，愁得他满脸皱纹。他往火塘里添了一把柴，回头望望床上呻吟着的妻子，心里盘算着：
    “……又要添一张吃饭的嘴了！三分水田、一亩八分旱地，怎么养得活这五口之家呵……明年的日子怎么过，今年这个冬怎么熬！老天爷不睁眼，偏偏今年冷得这么早……”
    “爹！我去隔壁屋里把杏婆婆请过来吧。”二姑娘玉英对坐着发楞的爹说。没等回答，她就开门跑了出去。一阵风挤进门来，把墙洞里的小油灯吹灭了，屋里一片漆黑。
    欧阳恒文在火塘里点燃了一根松明向油灯走去。
    “算啦，莫点灯熬油了！今天怕还不到日子。”女人在床上说。
    “攒下这盏把两盏油也熬不过冬！”欧阳恒文说着还是点着了小油灯。他焦急地望着窗外：“嵩伢子出去这么半天，也该回来了。要是他能借点把子粮食回来，你在月子里多少还有点吃的。……唉！都二十岁的人了，办事还这么不利索。”
    “跑也是空跑，穷亲穷友的，你让他到哪家去借哟？苦就苦在今年种的红薯也遭了大旱，没得么事收成，这一下雪，怕连野菜也……”
    门被推开了，玉英领着杏婆婆进来。杏婆婆在床前看了看脸色蜡黄的女人，回头对欧阳恒文说：
    “都发作啦，连水还没烧一盆！男人家先出去一下。”
    欧阳恒文来到屋檐下，听见屋里边女人一声接一声地哼着。雪越下越大，不一会儿，欧阳恒文的衣服褶缝上都堆满了雪花。他象根木头似的呆在门口，脑子里乱糟糟的。生儿育女，养家活口，眼下穷得想借也借不到，拿么事来填饱肚子、熬过冬呵！……他把两只长满厚茧的大手抱在胸前，嘴里默默地祷念着：“我们祖祖辈辈都住在这山沟里，苦撑苦熬到如今，未必到我恒文手上就……我不求金不求银，盼只盼明年多下点子雨水，来个好年成。我和嵩伢子拼死拼活再往坡上多甩几把汗水。穷人没得地，力气就是粮呵……”
    村口传来了一阵急促的脚步声，嵩伢子空着双手，气喘吁吁地跑了过来。
    “爹，我中了！”嵩伢子劈头一句。
    “中么事了？！”
    “中签啦！”
    “签！……么，么事签？”
    “壮丁签！”
    “啊！……”欧阳恒文浑身一颤，下意识地一把抓住了嵩伢子。
    “中午潘保长在乡公所当众开的柜。先说是刘大斗的二少爷中了；刘大斗打发人送了张帖子来，他姓潘的一改口，又说是我中了个‘上上’，头三名就有我一个！”
    欧阳恒文象是当头挨了一棒，晃晃悠悠地站不大稳。他明白，把嵩伢子一抓走，就算明年风调雨顺，那地里的工夫靠哪个呢？……这是要了全家的命罗！
    “不是说……不是说‘独子不当兵’吗？他们当官的法令，未必说改就改，说变就变啦！”爹爹急得舌头发直，话不成句地说，“你……你就不晓得跟，跟他们评评理！” 
    “法令？这是潘保长和刘大斗搞的鬼名堂！他拿了别个的包袱钱，硬拉我去补刘家二少爷的名字。”
    “不怕，嵩伢子，我们不怕！
   ‘独子不当兵’是上头定的法，他潘保长敢甩偏手，我就敢告他！”爹爹给自己壮着胆说，“告到区里，告到县政府，我也不怕他！”
    “爹呀！”嵩伢子气得直跺脚，
    “他潘保长说，我妈快生了，要是生个男的，那我就不是‘独子’了，依法该‘两丁抽一’！”
    “什么？生个儿子就‘两丁抽一’！……”欧阳恒文觉得天在打旋地在转，迎面扑来的雪片，象是一把把尖刀直钻心窝。他打了一个寒噤，心里凉了半截，仰头望着昏黑的夜空，嘴里不住地咕噜着：
    “‘两丁抽一’……‘两丁抽一’……”
    “哇——哇——”屋子里传出了婴儿的哭叫声，哭得那么响亮，清脆。
    “这……”他们两人被这突如其来的声音惊呆了，直楞楞地在雪地里站着。
    门开了，玉英姑娘飞快地跑了出来，高兴地喊着：
    “爹！妈生了，是个弟弟，是个弟弟呀！”
    杏婆婆也从门缝里探出头来：
    “恭喜恭喜呵，生了个儿子！‘丁成双，日子旺’呵。快进来看看。”
    “难为你了！”欧阳恒文对着杏婆婆苦笑了两声，急忙背转身去。他撕扯着胸前的衣襟，绝望地喊着：
    “杀人的老天爷！‘两丁抽一’呀！……”他试着抬了抬腿，可是迈不动步子。脚下的大地象裂开了一条缝，他正从这条缝里往下掉着；眼前发黑，什么也看不见了，满耳响起了呼呼的风声。他心里明白：这算掉进那万丈深渊里边去了……
    “哇——哇——”新生的婴儿在昏暗的茅屋里有力地哭叫着。这个不该出世的孩子呵，他伴随着严寒、饥饿和苦难，来到了人间。
    交二更了。
    屋子里静悄悄的。一家人围在火塘旁边，你望着我，我望着你，谁都没有出声。小儿子安详地躺在妈妈怀里。
    风还在刮，雪还在下……
    “唉！”床上的妈妈长叹了一声。她眼泪汪汪地望着怀里的儿子，把前前后后的事情想了又想。她摇摇头，无可奈何地说：“没有别的法子好想了，看哪家有福养得起，就趁早把他送过去，免得……”
    爹爹打断她的话说：“这兵荒马乱的年月，国民党当道，日本鬼子又要打过来，还有刘大斗、潘保长逼租要人催得紧，哪个还添得起一张嘴哟！”
    “那……”妈妈带着哭声说，
    “那只好趁天没亮，把他丢到土地庙旁边。……儿呵，要是你的命长，总会有好心人把你抱回去的……”
    “妈！”玉英哭着扑到妈妈的床前，“莫丢呵！……要丢，还、还不如把我卖了……”
    “二丫头！”妈妈摸着玉英的头说，“把你卖了，还不是要‘两丁抽一’！没有法子呵。不是做爹妈的心狠，就只当……就只当他不是妈妈身上的一块肉……”
    “妈！”嵩伢子闷声闷气地喊了一声。他想说，“抓丁就抓丁，豁出自己死在师管区，也不能把弟弟……”看了看妈妈的脸色，他把话又咽了回去。
    “伢子他爹，天不早了，你快些拿个主意呀！”妈妈催促着说。
    欧阳恒文双手托着脑袋在那里发楞，刚才的话他都听见了。可是，他能拿什么主意呢？丢到土地庙，不等天亮就会活活冻死；不丢，抓走了嵩伢子，全家靠哪个？把小儿子留在家里，也只有饿死这一条路呀！……全家静静地坐着。不知道过了多久，呼啸而过的北风里，传来几声鸡鸣。
    “伢子他爹，天快亮了，要抱就快点抱出去！”
    爹坐着没有动。妈妈把孩子托在手上说：
    “嵩伢子！来，你把弟弟抱……抱出去。”
    “我不抱！”哥哥低着脑袋没有动。
    “我来！”爹爹猛地一下站了起来，“不能为他饿死全家！”他浑身颤抖着，走上前去从妻子手上接过孩子，慢慢地走到油灯跟前，眯缝着眼睛，透过泪水把刚刚出生的小儿子看了又看：红彤彤的脸，一头黑发，连眼睛都没睁哩。“唉！……”他一咬牙，向门外走去。
    “爹……”嵩伢子和玉英一把扯住爹爹的后衣襟，跪下来喊着：
    “爹呀！……”
    爹爹没有理他们。玉英又回转头来望着床上的妈妈：
    “妈！你，你没看见，外头在下雪呀！……”
    妈妈赶忙背过身子，紧紧咬着衣角，双手撕扯着自己的头发。床上传来了轻微的啜泣声。
    欧阳恒文一阵心酸，两条腿象有千斤重，抱着怀里的儿子，他怎么能跨出跟前这道门槛！想起往后的日子，他跺了跺脚，喊着：“你们把手松开！”随即打开了门。
    一阵冷风夹着雪花涌进门来，怀里的儿子惊醒了，“哇”的一声哭了起来。
    这一声哭叫，象一根钢针刺进了妈妈的心，她喊道：
    “伢子他爹！你……”
    欧阳恒文停住了脚，回头望着披头散发的妻子。
    “你等等，等我……再给他加上件衣服！”妈妈说着，把儿子接了过来，脱下身上那件补钉挨补钉的棉袄，细心地把儿子裹得紧紧的。
    “哇——哇——”小儿子不停地哭着。妈妈急忙解开衣襟，把奶头塞进他的小嘴里，屋子里又恢复了平静。妈妈目不转睛地望着儿子，把儿子越搂越紧，恨不能在这几秒钟内，把全身的奶汁、血和爱都灌到儿子身上去。忽然，她拔出奶头，发疯似地喊着：“快！快接过去呀！”她意识到，儿子不能留在怀里了，只要再过一会儿，母子就再也无法分开……
    欧阳恒文抱着小儿子，踉踉跄跄地走出门去。雪扑打在他的脸上，一阵急风吹掉了他头上的破毡帽，他仍然如呆如痴地向前走着。该拐弯上路了，他找不到门口的那棵小松树。定神细看，小松树已经被大雪深深地盖住了，只留下一束松针在北风中摇曳……
    前边，土地庙象个白坟包似的立在岔路口，庙门，象张黑乎乎的大口，要把这父子两人全吞了进去。欧阳恒文来到跟前，他腾出一只手来把香烛台上的积雪拂掉，轻手轻脚地放下怀中的儿子，转身往回走去。
    小儿子默默地在香烛台上躺着，也许他会从此安详地睡过去，再也不会醒来了。
    两声凄厉的犬吠撕破了沉寂的雪夜，小儿子踢蹬着小腿哭了起来。这几声哭叫拖住了欧阳恒文的脚步，使他好似从恶梦中惊醒过来……这是第七胎了。早先的六胎冻死饿死了四个，只留下嵩伢子和英妹子两人。为了那些没能活下来的孩子，做爹娘的担了多少心，流过多少泪呵！……如今，儿子来了，又亲手把他扔到风雪地里……
    “这是我自己作孽，还是老天爷要绝我欧阳家的后呵？”他回过头来望着土地庙，“我在做么事？糊涂呵！我这是亲手把一个活活的儿子埋到雪里去了呀！”望着土地庙，望着漫天大雪，他不由自主地返身朝小儿子奔去。……
    妈妈倒在床上，听着门外的脚步声消失在风雪里了，心里象刀铰似的。这是掏走了她的心肝，挖掉了她身上的肉！十月怀胎不易呵，难得让儿子落了地，又眼睁睁地看着把他丢了。她越想越后悔，越想心越痛，只感到嘴里发咸，流不完的眼泪正往肚里淌哩！
    “不！……不！……这杀人的‘两丁抽一’呀！”妈妈嚎着。她从床上滚落地下，艰难地朝门口爬去……
    突然，象是一阵大风推开了两扇破门，欧阳恒文紧紧抱着儿子奔了回来：
    “抽丁就抽丁，抓人就抓人，要死我们也死在一堆！儿子没有罪，我不能把他丢出去。我不能呵！”
    全家看见爹爹抱着孩子跑了回来，反倒惊呆了，谁都说不出话来。母亲跪在地上，伸直手臂，嘴唇抖动着，半天才挤出一句话：
    “他爹，快，快，快把他给我呵！”她象捡回来一个儿子似的，飞快地扯开衣襟，把孩子紧紧贴在心口上。
    风还在刮，雪还在下……
    过了几天，雪刚刚停住，保长先生进山了。远远看见潘保长直奔茅屋走来，全家张惶失措，欧阳恒文连忙迎了上去。
    “恒文哪！听说你屋里又添了个丁，我公事忙，还没来恭喜恭喜哩！”保长说着就要跨进门来。
    “保长先生，我们穷家穷户的，生儿养女也是劫数呵！屋子里又小又脏，没有个落脚的地方。”欧阳恒文把身子一歪堵在门口。
    “不要紧，我们公事人不忌讳这些。如今抗战时期，又提倡起‘新生活’运动来了，蒋委员长规定，行人都靠左边走了嘛！……”保长用文明棍推开了恒文，正要迈腿，一只手从后边拉住了他。
    “保长哇！月子婆房里进不得。‘新生活’、旧生活都一样，沾了腥气要晦气一辈子的呀！”杏婆婆笑呵呵地拉住了保长，“你们当先生的，讲究的就是个功名前程。要真的误了你老的荣华富贵，他恒文家也担戴不起。有话到我屋里去说。”说着，半拉半推地把保长请到了她自己家里。
    “恒文！”保长开门见山地说，“你家嵩伢子中了个‘上上签’，又是当众开的柜，偏偏那天联保主任也在场过了目。唉，你我虽是乡里乡亲，我潘某人是要帮忙插不上手，想敬神也找不到庙呵。听说过不几天，师管区就来要人了。”
    欧阳恒文呆痴痴地站着，张了张嘴巴没有说话。
    杏婆婆递过来一碗茶，说：“保长先生，不是听说‘独子不当兵’吗？”
    姓潘的笑了笑：“是呵，‘独子不当兵’是上边定的法。可是恒文的婆娘前几天不又生了个丁吗？这叫‘两丁抽一’。我也是公事公办嘛！”
    “生儿子？”杏婆婆故意把嘴一撇，说，“恒文婆娘前世没有修来这个福，今生再也没有这个命罗！”
    “你说什么？”
    “又生了个丫头片子，赔钱货。”
    “真的？”保长放下茶碗站了起来。
    “是我接的生，那还假得了！不信，我们就过那边屋里看看去。” 
    “杏婆婆，你这个妇道人家可不兴胡言乱语呵，如今是‘一家犯法，十家连坐’！你要知情不报，蒙哄政府，可要罪加一等！”保长威胁着说。
    “我也犯不起这个法，我这就抱过来给你看看。”杏婆婆说完转身就走。她心里盘算：硬躲恐怕是躲不过去了；只要我有胆量抱过来，他姓潘的未必肯看。
    不一会儿，她果真把恒文的小儿子抱了过来。
    “是龙变不成凤，是凤变不成龙。你保长先生吃的是公事饭，让你老看真了好交差。”杏婆婆说着真的动手解小孩的破包被。
    欧阳恒文把两只手捏得直响，壮起胆子说：“是呵，看看也好，免得保长先生不信……”
    “唉呀！”杏婆婆忽然叫了起来，
    “这个死丫头，又屙了一身！保长先生……”
    “未必是他们传错了？……”潘保长一边想一边斜着眼睛看了一眼：一把骨头一张皮。心里引起一阵恶心，连忙挥了挥手说：
    “算啦，算啦！”
    杏婆婆还是笑呵呵地：“保长先生，还是看一看，公事公办罗！”
    “丫头就丫头，没有什么可看的。”姓潘的转身对着恒文说：“‘有钱出钱，有力出力’！丁可以不抽，这十石谷子的壮丁捐，你是一颗也不能少！前方的将士，等你的粮食吃。”
    潘保长提着文明棍走远了，欧阳恒文才喘出一口气来，只觉得两手冰凉，额头上冒出一阵冷汗。他感到浑身的骨头象散了架一样，就地瘫了下去。
    “你还蹲在这里做么事？”
    “我……我……”
    “你还不赶快起个名字报上去！”杏婆婆把婴儿递回到恒文手上说。
    孩子出生以前名字就起好了，是麻烦药铺的老先生起的。老大叫“嵩”，这生下来的要是个男，就单名一个“海”字，说是“高山”得“水”，日子才能过兴旺，全家图个吉利。欧阳恒文说：
    “名字起过了，小名‘三三’，官名‘欧阳海’。”
    “欧阳海？莫起这个海呀河的！要瞒就瞒到底。我看哪，起个丫头名字报上去！”
    “那……那叫个么名字好呵？”
    “他姐姐不叫玉英吗，他呀，就叫个‘玉蓉’吧！”
    “欧阳玉蓉？”恒文抱着儿子跨出门来，心里不知是苦还是甜。儿子要起个丫头名儿，这是个什么世道呵！
    “哇——”欧阳玉蓉哭起来了。迎面刮来一阵寒风，把人世间的全部冷酷，都吹进这个出世不久的孩子心里。寒冷、饥饿，就象一条条无形的绳子，紧紧地捆住了这个幼小的生命。
    “哇——哇——”欧阳玉蓉挥舞着小手挣扎着。他大声地喊着，哭叫着，响亮的哭叫声传遍了荒僻的老鸦窝。二、饿死不讨米
    门前的小松树快有碗口粗了，欧阳玉蓉——欧阳海满了七岁。
    两年前，听说是什么“胜利”啦，抓丁反倒抓得更恶些。有钱有势的人家，十兄八弟不当兵；缺盐少米的穷苦人，独子也要抓丁。男扮女装也没得用呵，小海留着半长的头发，穿着一身姐姐留下来的破夹袄，还是眼睁睁地看着大哥被保长用绳子五花大绑带走了。老大刚刚被押解到镇上，就被人按在板凳上剃了个“阴阳头”：半边留着头发、半边剃光，弄得人不象人鬼不象鬼——这样，你就是长上翅膀也飞不了啦。再加上“十人连保”、“非伍不动”——不凑够五、七个人，就是屎尿憋在裤裆里也不准上茅房。哪还有人敢跑，哪还有人跑得了呵！抓大哥的时候，潘保长没有说“国难当头”，说的是“戡乱建国”。这些话小海哪听得懂哩！他懂得的，只是从那一年起，妈妈就牵着他们姐弟俩出门讨米；第二年，爹爹到外乡去找活路，过年的那天，空着手，扛着根扁担回来。……他还不知道，大哥为了躲那几年壮丁，“壮丁捐”加上利钱，已经欠下刘大斗一百二十石谷；他更不知道，刘大斗和潘保长是看见他们家再也没有油水可榨了，这才把大哥捆去“戡乱”的。
    饥饿和灾难就象影子似的紧紧跟着小海全家。
    又是一个风雪交加的严冬。屋顶落白了，茅草屋檐上倒挂下来一根根长长的冰凌子，象一颗颗獠牙，象一把把倒挂着的尖刀，要把蜷缩在老鸦窝的人们撕碎嚼烂。一阵风起，它们跟着呜呜乱叫。
    小海一家五口——大哥被抓走了，家里又添了个妹子——围在火塘边上发愁。又到了揭不开锅的时候了。
    妈妈说：“辛辛苦苦在地里忙了一整年，汗水都流进刘家大屋去了！唉！……”她叹了口气，“他爹，守在屋里也不是个办法，我还是带着他们几个出门讨点去。”
    爹爹低着脑袋没有作声。姐姐赶忙把讨米篮和棍子找了出来，说：
    “走哇，妈！”
    爹爹横了姐姐一眼：“你莫去！……这么大的丫头出门去讨米，别个笑话。”
    “让他们笑去。我不怕！”姐姐辩了一句。
    “你不怕？”爹爹想发脾气又忍了回去，转身对妈说，“丫头不小了，再出去讨米……哪还有人肯上门来说亲哟！我们不能误她一辈子。”
    “我……”姐姐噙着眼泪，望着妈妈，“妈！我……我到老都跟着你……”
    妈妈眼圈也红了：“英妹子，过年你就满十九吃二十的饭了，不能再……”
    姐姐哭着躲到门角里。妈妈叹了口气，拍着小海的头说：“三三，我们走。”
    玉英把讨米篮和棍子塞到弟弟手里，眼泪巴?巴?地往下掉着。她望着妈妈说：
    “妈，把四妹子留下来吧，刚满月，外边又下着这么大的雪！”
    妈妈把四妹子交到玉英手上，想了想，又把她抱了过来。
    “还是抱着吧，抱上她好讨些。要不，哪个肯施舍呢？”妈妈说完，领着三三走出门去。
    姐姐赶到门口喊着：“三三，叫妈早去早回来！”
    漫天大雪，上哪儿去讨！老鸦窝穷家穷户的没人施舍得起；要讨米得逢墟赶集。今天的墟在沙塘，来回四十几里。走了没几步，妈妈回转头说：“三三，我们今天到莲溪去，那里近些。”
    老鸦窝山顶上有两个黑点在慢慢移动：妈妈抱着四妹子走在前面；小海留着半长的头发，还穿着姐姐那身紫红色的破夹袄，牵着妈妈的衣襟紧跟在后边。
    洁白的雪地上留下了两行脚印：妈妈的脚印子深一些；小海才七岁，脚印浅浅的，但上边清晰地印着五个脚趾头。脚印从老鸦窝铺到莲溪，整整十五里。
    一阵疾风刮来，卷起层层雪粒跟在母子三人的后边打转。脚印渐渐地被雪盖住了。……
    莲溪镇上家家关门闭户，街上一个行人也没有。妈妈牵着小海进了街，前边就是刘大斗的刘家大屋了：红门高墙，墙上有好多幅画，画的都是些财主，有的在下棋，有的骑着马。小海常想：“为么事他们不讨米呢？”大门口还蹲着一对呲牙咧嘴的石头狮子。小海每次路过这里，总想上前用手摸一摸。狮子口里还含着一颗球哩，也不晓得是怎么含进去的。小海总是想：“要是能够骑到狮子背上去，那该有多好！”……快到刘家大屋，快看见石狮子了，妈妈一转身，牵着小海拐进一条窄巷子里。
    “妈！顺街上走嘛！”小海一心想看看狮子。
    “大屋去不得。那里狗凶人也恶。”
    “我……”
    “听话！”妈妈扑打着小海头上的雪花说，“这边有讨的。”
    小海踩着妈妈的脚印拐进了巷子，还不时地回过头来，想望望那对狮子。
    好几十家铺面的莲溪街上，只有一家杂货铺下了门板，一家铁匠炉生了火。母子三人来到店铺门口，妈妈刚伸出手来，里边的掌柜先生就吼起来了：
    “去去去！今天还没有开张哩。”
    母子三人在街上转了个把时辰，找不到一处可开口的地方。小海的两只赤脚在雪地里冻得又红又肿，妈妈也走得两眼直冒金花。她在一家屋檐底下坐了下来，招呼着身边的孩子说：
    “三三，过来，让妈替你把脚暖一暖。”
    小海紧靠着妈妈坐着，把一双脚心、脚背都裂开了口子的小脚，伸进妈妈怀里。脚早就冻僵了，妈妈摸着这双冰冷的脚，心里在说：
    “有钱人家的伢子象他这么大，棉鞋都穿破六七双了；我们的三三从娘胎落地到如今，一直是一双赤脚……”她感到浑身发紧，五脏六腑象被什么扯着似的阵阵作痛。
    不知道是冷还是饿，妈妈怀里的四妹子哭起来了。几口冷风呛得她半天没喘过气来，哭声又憋了回去，嘴里不停地吐着白沫。妈妈急了，连忙掐着她的人中，发狂似地喊着：
    “四妹子，四妹子！……”
    “唉！”身边一声叹息，斜对门的铁匠师傅端着一碗开水走过来说，“大嫂子，你不该呀！大风大雪的，拖儿带女出门讨么事米罗！今天又不逢墟，没得人施舍打发。”
    “我们是不常出来的，没得办法呀，师傅。”妈妈接过开水说。
    “出来也是受罪。走，到我炉边上去暖和暖和。” 
    他们三人跟着铁匠师傅来到炉边。好半天四妹子才缓过气来，张着小嘴又哭起来了。妈妈解开衣襟，把干瘪瘪的奶头塞进她嘴里。四妹子吃力地吸吮着。妈妈咬着牙，紧锁着眉头。四妹子每吸一口，妈妈的嘴角就随着颤动一下……这阵阵绞痛从妈妈脸上传到小海心里，他知道，妈妈身上已经没有奶了。四妹吮不出奶汁来，松开奶头大声地哭了起来。妈妈使劲地揉着胸脯，想再挤出一滴半滴奶汁喂喂孩子。可是糠菜都吃不饱的母亲，身上再也挤不出奶来了。四妹子仍然不停地哭着……
    妈妈脸上的痛苦，四妹子嘶哑的哭声，象一把把刀子在割小海心上的肉。他一阵心酸，情不自禁地喊了一声：
    “妈！……”
    妈妈诧异地望着小海：“你怎么了？饿了？”
    “不，我不饿。”
    站在一边的铁匠师傅走过来说：“大嫂子，我也是个半饥半饱的人，唉！没得办法罗。”说着从炉边翻出一个红薯递到妈妈手上。
    妈妈不好意思再打扰别人，说了声“难为难为”，急忙牵着小海走了。到了街口，她才把红薯塞在小海手里：“三三，你吃了。”
    “妈，你吃吧。”
    “听话！趁热吃了你先回去。”
    “妈，你先回吧！我讨着一口半口就回来。”
    妈妈觉得今天是有些不舒服，眼前一阵阵发黑。怀里的四妹子喉咙都哭哑了。看样子，再也讨不到什么了。她嘱咐小海说：“三三，你到穷家穷户去讨，莫到大户人家去要呵！小心狗子。”
    “我晓得。”
    “早点回来！”妈妈把半片破麻袋披在小海身上说，“讨不到就算了，啊？”
    “嗯。”小海低头答应着，心口好象被一个什么东西堵住了。他悄悄把热呼呼的红薯塞进妈妈的篮子里。
    妈妈抱着四妹子，拄着棍子走远了，小海才慢慢地抬起头来，眼泪不停地往下滚着。这么大的天下，就没有他可吃的东西；这么大的镇子，就没有一家可讨的。他在街上走着，一心在想：只要能讨着一口吃的，我就给四妹子送回屋去。……走呵走呵，脚下的雪吱吱作响，肚子里也咕咕地叫得更厉害了。不知道过了多久，突然，一团雪球砸在他的脊梁上。回头一看，刘家大屋门口的两个石狮子睁着大眼瞪着他；半开着的门缝里，有几个脑袋在晃动，里边传来叽叽喳喳的议论声：
    “这是个假丫头！”
    “对！那年他大哥想躲壮丁，他爹还给他起过一个丫头名字。”
    想起了大哥被抓丁，小海心底升起了一股火。他抓起两个雪团，狠狠地朝半开着的门扔去。
