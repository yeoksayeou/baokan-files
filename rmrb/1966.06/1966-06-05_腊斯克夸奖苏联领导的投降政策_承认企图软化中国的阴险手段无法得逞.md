    New China News Agency, Oslo, June 3rd: At a press conference held at Oslo Airport in the Norwegian capital on the 2nd, Rusk particularly praised the Soviet leading group for implementing the so-called US-Soviet cooperation policy of capitulation to the United States.

    According to the United States Information Service, Rusk said that the United States was "pleased that the Soviet Union recently 'suggested in the United Nations that an agreement on outer space be reached along the lines previously formulated by President Johnson.'" He further said: "The United States hopes to work with the Soviet Union in the same way to make progress on disarmament."

    At the same time, Rusk's words show that the United States will continue to play the counter-revolutionary dual tactics against China: on the one hand, it insists on the "containment" policy of being hostile to China. Therefore, the United States has concluded a series of bilateral treaties with many of China's neighbors and insists on continuing to occupy China's territory of Taiwan; on the other hand, it also makes gestures to "improve relations" with China. But he had to admit that China had seen through the insidious means by which the United States wanted to soften China, and made it impossible for the United States to succeed.

    Rusk arrived in Norway on the 2nd from Finland for an official visit. Just as in Finland, he was greeted by the Norwegian people's angry protests against the American aggression in Vietnam.

    Long before Rusk arrived, the Norwegian people drew anti-American slogans on the roads Rusk was scheduled to pass, and posted cartoons on the walls, with portraits of Rusk in military uniform and the inscription: "Rusk wants to kill!" Police chased and arrested demonstrators and blocked traffic to the airport where Rusk landed, but all this could not stop the protests of the demonstrators. On the evening of Rusk's arrival, about 1,500 people marched in the city center. They carried signs against the American war of aggression in Vietnam, marched through the streets, and demonstrated at the American embassy.

    腊斯克夸奖苏联领导的投降政策
    承认企图软化中国的阴险手段无法得逞
    新华社三日讯　奥斯陆消息：腊斯克二日在挪威首都奥斯陆机场上举行记者招待会时，特别夸奖苏联领导集团执行向美国投降的所谓美苏合作政策。
    据美国新闻处报道，腊斯克说，苏联最近“在联合国内建议根据约翰逊总统以前制订的路线达成一项关于外层空间的协议，美国对此感到高兴”。他进一步说：“美国希望同苏联一道以同样方式在裁军问题上有所前进。”
    同时，腊斯克的话表明，美国将继续玩弄对中国的反革命两手策略：一方面，坚持同中国为敌的“遏制”政策，因此美国同中国的许多邻国缔结了一系列的双边条约，并且坚持要继续霸占中国领土台湾；另一方面，又作出要同中国“改善关系”的姿态。但是他不得不承认，中国识破了美国想软化中国的阴险手段，使美国无法得逞。
    腊斯克二日从芬兰到挪威进行正式访问。正象在芬兰一样，迎接他的是挪威人民对美国侵略越南的愤怒抗议。
    早在腊斯克到达前，挪威人民就在腊斯克预定要经过的公路上绘制反美标语，并且在墙壁上张贴漫画，上面有穿军装的腊斯克画象和题字：“腊斯克想杀人！”警察追逐并且逮捕示威者，还封锁了通向腊斯克着陆的机场的交通，但是这一切都不能阻挡住示威群众的抗议行动。在腊斯克到达的当天晚上，有大约一千五百人在市中心游行。他们拿着反对美国在越南进行侵略战争的标语牌，通过大街，到美国大使馆去示威。
