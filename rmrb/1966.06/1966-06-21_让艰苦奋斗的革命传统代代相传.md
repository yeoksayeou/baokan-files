    Let the Revolutionary Tradition of Hard Struggle Be Passed Down From Generation to Generation
    Lu Kaiyou, President of a Hospital of a PLA Unit in Kunming
    A proletarian revolutionary should not only dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution and struggle hard for their entire life, but also ensure that future generations wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to the revolution and struggle hard to the end. As far as our long-term goals are concerned, no matter how well a single generation revolts, it will not be successful. Only through generations of revolution, generation after generation, can the "Long March" be completed, and the proletarian revolutionary cause achieve final victory.
    Here, the most important thing is to arm the younger generation with Mao Zedong Thought. In my contact with young people, I have found that they have the desire and ideals to be good successors, but their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought as the true revolutionary truth, the magic weapon for liberating the suffering people, and the weapon for overcoming all difficulties is not concrete enough; their understanding of succession as inheriting Mao Zedong Thought and inheriting revolutionary traditions is not clear enough. I, having followed the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution for a few more years, have a deeper understanding of this point than young people. I don't have much theory, so I use concrete things from my personal experience to tell them how Chairman Mao struggled against various forms of opportunism, guiding the Chinese revolution onto the right path, how he saved the Chinese revolution in the most dangerous and difficult times, and how he steadily steered the great ship of the Chinese revolution amidst storms and waves, leading the revolution from victory to victory. I explain to them that Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our Party, the family treasure of the revolution. With it, the revolution can be victorious, the people can be liberated, the country can become prosperous and strong, and individuals can make progress; without it, the revolution will run into obstacles, the people will suffer, the country will be bullied, and individuals will make mistakes. I think that the more young people know about these things and these principles, the more benefits it will bring to the revolution, and the more help it will be in inspiring them to consciously grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, wherever I go, I propagate it. I speak to comrades in my unit, and also to comrades in other units; I speak to comrades in the army, and also to comrades in the local areas; I speak to cadres, and also to soldiers, workers, and farmers; I speak at large meetings, at small meetings, and also during informal chats after class. Last year, our hospital transferred several nurses from a certain place. When they saw our living environment, some couldn't eat their first meal, and some even cried. I let them live in the hospital headquarters first, while telling them how Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution to victory, about the hard life during the war years, and about the hopes the revolution had for them. At the same time, I organized them to study articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Now, these comrades are all working very well.
    The older generation must arm the younger generation with Mao Zedong Thought, and first of all, arm themselves, setting a good example of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I myself insist on studying Chairman Mao's works, squeezing out half an hour every day, half a day every Sunday, plus the regularly scheduled study time each week, so that I can study Chairman Mao's works for more than ten hours a week. At the application meetings, I share my experiences with everyone, speaking from personal experience, talking about how I used Mao Zedong Thought to transform my personal thinking, how I used Mao Zedong Thought to promote my personal continuous revolution, and how I used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the work of building the hospital. Young people are unwilling to lag behind. If they are guided well, they will catch up and surpass us, running ahead of us in mastering Mao Zedong Thought.
    To cultivate successors, it is also necessary to pass on the glorious revolutionary tradition. Tradition is very concrete, concrete in all fields of thought, work, and life, concrete in a person's every thought, every word, every action, every piece of clothing, and every item of use. If you want young people to inherit the tradition, you must first let them see what tradition is, and you must make yourself a living model of upholding the tradition. It is not easy to do this, because this cannot be solved by just talking about it; it requires practical action. What's even more difficult is that you have to always persist in being a living model of tradition, not just for a day or two, not just for a demonstration or a performance. Because young people learn tradition in long-term practical struggle, relying on the promotion of living models, and also on the infection of the surrounding environment.
    On the issue of upholding the fine tradition of hard struggle, this is what I do:
    I am a Red Army soldier. In 1933, when I was twelve years old, my family was ruined and killed by the landlord. I begged for food and joined the Red Army. Under the education of the Party and the influence of Mao Zedong Thought, I slowly learned some revolutionary principles from a miserable child who only knew how to avenge my family. Due to the habits formed during the long years of war, and having worked in the relatively harsh border areas after the victory, my life is relatively simple. As for food, except for the one or two years I worked in the office, I have always insisted on eating the same food as everyone else. At a certain hospital, a medium-sized canteen was once established, and several comrades insisted that I go there to eat, but after eating there for a day or two, I felt very unaccustomed to it. It's better to squat together with everyone to eat, chat and laugh, and be able to talk about things at any time and understand the situation in a timely manner. I returned to the large canteen, and the medium-sized canteen was also disbanded. Let it be disbanded. Compared with the border people, the large canteen life is very good, so what do you need a medium-sized canteen for! No matter how good it is, how can you eat it! Some comrades have raised objections several times, saying that the travel expenses are not enough. I just can't figure out this bill. A bowl of noodles in the morning costs a dime, a bowl of cabbage and tofu, two bowls of rice at noon, costs twenty cents or so, a little better in the afternoon, costs more than twenty cents, more than fifty cents a day, and the travel expenses are not even used up, so how can you say it's not enough? Last year, the hospital where I was working was very short of housing. Today we moved here, tomorrow we moved there. Finally, there was a large house, which was separated into several rooms with wooden boards. I lived in a small room of less than ten square meters. Without a desk, I used a wooden box for books instead. I spent a few dimes to buy a small bamboo stool, and it was good enough for office work. Without a bed, I found a board, padded it with bricks, and slept on it. Later, some bunk beds were borrowed from the local area, and some comrades wanted me to use one first. I thought, it's a hospital, so everything should be given to the convalescents first. Why should the staff be in a hurry! The second time some planks came, and some comrades wanted to change a set for me. I said, at least I still have a board, and some staff members only have a straw mat, so they should be given priority. The third time some planks came, I found that the cooks were still sleeping on the floor, so I gave them to them. Everyone slept on beds. I used two stools to support the original wooden board, which was no different from a bunk bed, and it was quite stable to sleep on. The sheet on the bed was bought in 1952. After a few years of use, it was worn out in the middle, so I cut it horizontally and pieced it together from both ends; after a few years, it was worn out again, so I cut it vertically and pieced it together from both sides. Now it looks like it can still be used for a few years. Make the best use of everything, and use it for as long as possible.
    Some comrades, seeing this situation in my life, said that I was going too far, too hard. What kind of hardship is this? Compared to when I was driven out of my home by the landlord, with no house to live in, and I built a thatched shed in the mountains; with no food to eat, chewing chaff and vegetables, begging for food everywhere; never wearing a pair of shoes before the age of ten, and coming to join the Red Army barefoot, it's countless times better!
    There are also some old comrades who, when they meet me, say: What are you doing, still this way! "Too conservative." Some even pointed to the plain black cloth clothes I was wearing and called me "old miser." Some comrades below, seeing me wearing a patched military uniform, also said that I was "too shabby," "not like a hospital director."
    These reactions aroused my ideological struggle. I asked myself: Is the conservative thinking of the peasants still playing tricks on me?
    It was Chairman Mao's book that opened my mind and strengthened my actions. Chairman Mao pointed out: Unwillingness to share weal and woe with the masses is a dangerous tendency. We must oppose big eating and drinking and pay attention to thrift. Chairman Mao taught us: We must always think that our country is a large socialist country, but also an economically backward and poor country. It will take decades of hard struggle to make our country rich and strong. He taught us: We must maintain the style of hard struggle.
    If you don't listen to Chairman Mao, who do you listen to! If you don't act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, whose instructions do you act on! I said to myself: The environment has changed, the conditions have changed, but whatever changes, the revolutionary tradition cannot change! I thought of some people who were defeated in the face of sugar-coated bullets, and eight or nine out of ten started from their lives. The person who called me "old miser" was like that. After the victory of the democratic revolution, I saw that he was very particular about what he wore and used, and spent money very "generously," dressing himself up like an old merchant. I advised him not to do this, but he didn't listen, and even said that he wanted to influence me and wanted me to walk with him more. I said: I'm not on the same path as you. Later, this person made serious mistakes. This made me further realize that: the issue of lifestyle is a breakthrough point for the enemy's "peaceful evolution"; hard work and simplicity are the defense against the enemy breaking through this breakthrough point. If a gap is broken today, it will be a hole tomorrow. This line of defense must be kept well.
    On the other hand, I saw that some young people talked about eating and dressing, and spent all their心思 on life problems. The young man who said I was "shabby" in patched clothes usually emphasized working hours when working, and was particular about "color matching" in dressing, what color shirt, what color pants, thinking that wearing it straight and having a "frame" is considered "beautiful." In fact, they are pursuing the bourgeois lifestyle. And the class enemies are using the weaknesses of these people to lure these people, corrupt these people, and place the hope of "peaceful evolution" on these people.
    This situation made me further realize that: for our generation, it is not only necessary to let young people understand the significance of maintaining a style of hard work, but more importantly, to set a good example for them in maintaining a style of hard work. Therefore, whether we are hardworking and simple in our lives or not is by no means a matter of spending a few more dollars and spending a few less dollars, but a matter of setting an example for young people, a matter of not allowing the enemy to find a breakthrough point for "peaceful evolution," a matter of whether or not revisionism will emerge. That young man, under the education of the Party and the influence of the surrounding comrades, has already understood that the first thing that matters in being beautiful is looking at one's thoughts. A mind full of personal plans is not beautiful no matter how well you dress; a mind filled with Mao Zedong Thought is beautiful even if there are a few scars on your clothes. Now, she also talks about "color matching," but she talks about the pure and unadulterated proletarian ideology, not the color of clothes. Understanding this principle and seeing the example of the surrounding comrades, she has already shifted her energy from life issues to studying Chairman Mao's works and to doing a good job. In the past, when someone asked her to do something after work, she was impatient; now, after work, she still looks for things to do. She said: "There can be a time limit for going to and from work, but there is no distinction between going to and from work in doing revolution. You have to make revolution even after work."
    Young people are like saplings, and some trees will grow crooked for a while during their growth. That doesn't matter, if it grows crooked, you can correct it like a nursery worker, and it can still grow into good timber.
    Through a long period of revolutionary practice, I have deeply realized that: Mao Zedong Thought is the powerful driving force for us to overcome everything and transform everything, and of course it is also the powerful driving force to promote our hard struggle, and the powerful driving force to promote the hard struggle of the next generation. To do good deeds for the people all our lives and to struggle hard for the revolution for decades as one day, we must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime. I often warn myself: A person's mind is like a lamp. If you want this lamp to shine and generate heat forever for the proletarian revolutionary cause, you must constantly add oil to the lamp; otherwise, the lamp will go out. And this oil is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    让艰苦奋斗的革命传统代代相传
    昆明部队某医院院长　路开友
    一个无产阶级革命者，不仅自己要一心一意为革命艰苦奋斗一辈子，还要使后代也一心一意为革命艰苦奋斗到底。就我们的远大目标来说，一代革命，革得再好，也革不成功。只有一代接一代，代代革命，“万里长征”才能走完，无产阶级革命事业才能取得最后胜利。
    这里，最重要的是用毛泽东思想去武装年轻一代。我在同年轻人接触中，发现他们有当好接班人的愿望和理想，但他们对毛泽东思想是革命的真理，是解放受苦人的法宝，是排除万难的武器，理解得并不具体；对接班就是接毛泽东思想、接革命传统，认识得并不明确。我这人，跟着党和毛主席多革了几年命，对这一点比年轻人理解得深一些。我没有更多的道理，就用亲身经历的具体事情，向他们宣传毛主席怎样同各种机会主义作斗争，把中国革命引导到正路上来，怎样在最艰险、最困难的时候挽救了中国革命，怎样在大风大浪中稳掌中国革命的大舵，领导革命由胜利走向胜利。向他们说明毛泽东思想是我们党的命根子，是革命的传家宝，有了它，革命就能胜利，人民就能得到解放，国家就能富强，个人就能进步；离开它，革命碰壁，人民遭殃，国家受欺负，个人犯错误。我想，这些事情，这些道理，能够多让一个年轻人知道，对革命会多一分好处，对激发他们自觉掌握毛泽东思想会多一分帮助。所以，我走到哪里，宣传到哪里。给本单位的同志讲，也给外单位的同志讲；给部队同志讲，也给地方同志讲；给干部讲，也给战士、职工、农民讲；开大会讲，开小会讲，课外活动摆家常也讲。去年，我们医院从某地调来几个护士，一看到我们住的环境，有的第一顿饭就没吃下去，有的甚至哭鼻子。我让他们先住在院部，一面给他们讲毛主席怎样领导中国革命取得胜利，讲战争年代的艰苦生活，讲革命对他们的希望，一面组织他们学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章。现在，这几个同志工作得都挺好。
    老一代人要用毛泽东思想武装年轻一代，首先得武装自己，给年轻人作活学活用毛主席著作的好样子。我自己坚持学习毛主席著作，每天挤时间学习半小时，每个星期日学半天，加上每周规定的学习时间，一个星期可以学习十几小时的毛主席著作。在讲用会上，我同大家一起讲用，现身说法，讲我怎样用毛泽东思想改造个人的思想，怎样用毛泽东思想推动个人不断革命，怎样用毛泽东思想指导建院工作。青年人是不甘落后的，引导得好，他们就会跟上来，超过去，在掌握毛泽东思想上跑到我们前面去。
    培养接班人，还要把光荣的革命传统传下去。传统这东西，具体得很，具体到思想、工作、生活的各个领域里，具体到一个人的一思一念，一言一行，一穿一用之中。你要年轻人接传统，你就得先让人家看到什么是传统，就要使自己成为坚持传统的活样板。做到这一点，比较不容易，因为这不是讲一讲就能解决问题的，要实际行动。更困难的是，你要永远坚持做传统的活样板，不是作一朝一夕，不是作个示范，表演一下就行了。因为年轻人学传统，要在长期的实际斗争中学，要靠活样板的推动，也要靠周围环境的感染。
    在坚持艰苦奋斗优良传统这个问题上，我是这样做的：
    我是一个红军战士。一九三三年，我十二岁时，被地主害得家破人亡，我讨着饭投奔了红军。在党的教育下，在毛泽东思想的熏陶下，我从一个只晓得报家仇的苦孩子，慢慢地懂得了一些革命道理。由于战争年代长期养成的习惯，胜利后又一直在比较艰苦的边疆地区工作，我的生活比较起来，简单一点。说吃吧，除了在机关工作的一两年外，我一直坚持同大家吃一样的饭。在某医院时，一度曾成立了中灶，几个同志硬要我去吃，可是我吃了一两天，怪不习惯的，不如同大家蹲在一起吃饭有说有笑，有什么事情随时可以谈谈，了解情况及时。我回到了大灶，中灶食堂也解散了。解散就解散吧，同边疆人民比较起来，大灶生活就很不错了，还要什么中灶！再好了，怎么能吃得下去呢！有的同志曾经几次提意见，说出差费不够用。我就算不过这个账，早晨吃碗面，角把钱，中午吃碗白菜豆腐，两碗米饭，两角来钱，下午吃好一点，两角多钱，一天五角多钱，出差费还用不了呢，怎么能说不够用？去年我所在的医院，房子很紧张，今天搬这里，明天搬那里，最后有间大房子，用木板隔成好几间，我住了不到十平方米的一小间。没有办公桌，用装书的木箱子代替，再花几角钱买了个小竹凳子，配起来办公满好的。没有床，找块板，垫上砖，就睡上去。后来，从地方上借来些架子床，有的同志要我先用一张。我想，医院嘛，什么都应该先让休养员用，工作人员何必急呢！第二次来了些铺板，有的同志又要给我换一套。我说，好赖我还有一块板，有的工作人员只有一张草垫子，该先给他们。第三次又来了些铺板，我发现炊事班还是地铺，就分给了他们。大家都睡上了床。我用了两条凳子，把原来那块木板支撑起来，同架子床没有什么两样，睡上怪平稳的。床上铺的一块单子，是一九五二年买的，用了几年，中间磨破了，我把它横裁开，从两头拼起来；过了几年又磨烂了，我再把它直裁开，从两边拼起来，现在看还可以用几年。物尽其用，能用到什么时候，就用到什么时候。
    有的同志看到我生活上的这种情况，说我过分了，太刻苦了。这算啥苦？比我在家里被地主赶出来，没房子住，在山里搭了个茅草棚棚；没饭吃，嚼糠咽菜，到处讨饭；十几岁没穿过一双鞋，参加红军时还光着屁股来，不知要好多少倍了！
    还有的老同志一见面就说我：你怎么搞的，现在还是这个劲！“太保守了”。有的甚至指着我身上的黑平布便衣，叫我“老财迷”。下面有些同志，见我穿带补疤的军衣，也说我“太寒酸”，“不象个院长样子”。
    这一些反应，引起了我的思想斗争。我问自己：是不是农民的保守思想还在我身上作怪呀？
    还是毛主席的书开了我的心窍，坚定了我的行动。毛主席指出：不愿意和群众同甘共苦，是一种危险的倾向。要反对大吃大喝，注意节约。毛主席教导我们：要经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间。教导我们：务必保持艰苦奋斗的作风。
    不听毛主席的话，听谁的话呢！不按毛主席的指示办事，按谁的指示办事呢！我对自己说：环境变了，条件变了，千变万变，革命的传统不能变！我想到一些在糖衣炮弹面前吃败仗的人，十之八九都是从生活上开始的。叫我“老财迷”的那个人就是这样。民主革命胜利后，我看到他很讲究穿用，花钱很“大方”，把自己打扮得象个旧商人一样。我劝他不要这样，他不听，还口口声声要影响我，要我多同他一起走走。我说：我同你不一条道。后来，这人犯了严重的错误。这使我进一步认识到：生活作风问题是敌人“和平演变”的一个突破口；艰苦朴素是抵制敌人打破这个突破口的防线。今天破个缝，明天就是个洞。这条防线一定要把好。
    另一方面，我看到有的年轻人讲吃讲穿，把心思全费在生活问题上。说我穿补疤衣服“寒酸”的那个年轻人，平时工作强调上下班时间，穿衣服讲究“配色”，什么颜色的上衣，配什么颜色的裤子，认为穿得笔挺笔挺，有个“架子”才算
  “美”。其实是在追求资产阶级生活方式。而阶级敌人正利用这些人的这个弱点，引诱这些人，腐蚀这些人，把“和平演变”的希望寄托在这些人身上。
    这种情况使我进一步认识到：对我们这一代人来说，不仅要让年轻人懂得保持艰苦作风的意义，更重要的是要给他们作个保持艰苦作风的好样子。因此，我们生活上艰苦朴素与不艰苦朴素，绝不是多花几个钱和少花几个钱的问题，而是给年轻人作个什么样子的问题，是关系到不让敌人找到“和平演变”的突破口的问题，是出不出修正主义的问题。那个年轻人，在党的教导下，在周围同志的影响下，已经懂得了美不美首先看思想。满脑子的个人打算，穿得再好也不美；头脑里装上了毛泽东思想，即使衣服上有几个疤也是美的。现在，她也讲“配色”，但讲的是清一色的无产阶级思想，不是衣服的颜色。懂得了这个道理，又看到了周围同志的样子，她把精力已经从生活问题上转移到学习毛主席著作上了，转移到搞好工作上了。过去，下了班，别人找她办个事，她不耐烦；现在，下了班，她还找事干。她说：“上下班可以有时间界限，干革命不能分上班下班，下了班也要革命。”
    年轻人好象一棵棵小树，在成长中，有的树一时也会长歪的。那不要紧，它长歪了，你象花木工人那样把它矫正过来，还是可以长成好材的。
    经过较长时期的革命实践，我深深体会到：毛泽东思想是我们战胜一切，改造一切的强大动力，当然也是推动我们艰苦奋斗的强大动力，推动下一代艰苦奋斗的强大动力。要为人民作一辈子好事，为革命艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，就得活学活用一辈子毛主席著作。我经常告诫自己：人的头脑象一盏灯，你要这盏灯永远为无产阶级革命事业发光放热，就得不断地给灯里添油；否则，灯就要熄灭。而这油，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
