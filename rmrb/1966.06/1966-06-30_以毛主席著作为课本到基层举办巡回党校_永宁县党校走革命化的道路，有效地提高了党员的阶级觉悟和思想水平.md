The Party School in Yongning County Follows the Revolutionary Path, Effectively Raising the Class Consciousness and Ideological Level of Party Members

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, June 28th: The Party School in Yongning County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, broke away from the "standardized" framework of running a school, went out of the county seat to communes and production brigades to hold mobile party schools, closely linking theory with practice, and effectively raising the class consciousness and ideological level of party members.

Since last August, the Yongning County Party School has held nine sessions of party member training classes in seven communes. The brigade party branch secretaries, branch committee members, production team party small group leaders, and party team leaders in these communes have all undergone one to two training sessions. In addition, the mobile party school has trained a batch of political work cadres and party class teachers for the 71 production brigades in the entire county.

After the socialist education movement, Yongning County has purified the leadership core of the party branches, expanded the party's ranks, and increased the number of new hands in the party branch committees and new party members. In response to this new situation, the Yongning County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that it is necessary to strengthen the ideological construction of the party and run the party school well. The party school must follow the revolutionary path, use Chairman Mao's works as textbooks, go to the grassroots to run mobile schools, and quickly raise the ideological awareness and work ability of party members.

At the beginning of proposing to run mobile party schools, there were some ideological obstacles, such as some people thinking that going to the countryside to run a party school is not "standardized" enough and does not look like a party school; some rural party members believed in the "standardized" method of running a party school in the county seat in the past, thinking that mobile party schools could not solve any problems. To explore experience, Vice Principal Zhang Ruimin of the county party school, with his luggage on his back, personally went to the Zhangzhen Commune to conduct a trial. He first went deep into the brigades and production teams, worked with the commune members during the day, and held meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants at night, understanding the problems in the work of the grassroots party organizations and the ideological trends of rural party members. Based on thorough investigation and research, he determined that Mao Zedong's "Three Articles" and "Put Down Your Burdens, Start Your Engines," "The Whole Party Should Unite to Struggle for the Realization of the Party's Tasks," and "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Work Methods" would be used as teaching materials; after each class, the "small rectification" method would be used to link thoughts and work, and discussions would be held. The effect of holding a party member training class in Zhangzhen Commune was very good. Party members generally reflected that "in the past, going to the county seat to attend a party school, only theory was taught, and it was not well understood, with little gain. This time, the party school's classes hit our 'sickness,' solving problems," "a door-to-door party school is good!"

Through the trial, it was proven that as long as Chairman Mao's works are used as the guideline and ideological revolutionization is the center, breaking away from the "fear" and "self" first, mobile party schools can definitely be run well. Thus, the county party school firmly decided to go to the countryside to run a party school.

Over the past eight months, the greatest advantage of the Yongning County Party School going to the countryside to run mobile schools is that theory and practice are more closely linked, achieving targeted results. Because the party school staff went deep into the production teams and closely relied on the commune party committees and brigade party branches, they had a clear and accurate understanding of the problems in the grassroots party organizations and the active thoughts of the party members, making the lectures more targeted. In the past, when running a party school in the county seat, due to the limitations of the conditions, the students did not know each other well. Now that the party school has moved to the commune or brigade, the students generally know each other, making it convenient to carry out criticism and self-criticism. This is very effective in raising the class consciousness of party members and transforming their thoughts. Some training classes, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," generally recognized that communist party members must wholeheartedly serve the people and unconditionally obey the needs of the party and the people. Everyone expressed their determination to drive out the "fear" and "self" from their minds, and to put in "completely," "thoroughly," and "do" to become thorough revolutionaries. Some party members who originally feared that being a cadre would be a loss also corrected their thoughts and expressed their willingness to work wholeheartedly for the revolution. Some female party members who originally had an inferiority complex also expressed that in the future, they would work as hard as men, and what men could do, they could also do, and even better.

The mobile party school, in response to the increase in new hands in the party branch committees and the lack of work methods, organized everyone to study Chen Yonggui's "Thousands of Rules, First and Foremost is Politics" and Zhou Mingshan's "Political Work Experience of Nangliu Brigade Party Branch." While learning from the work experience of other places, the mobile party school paid attention to summarizing and promoting the good work experience of local party branches and party small groups. Students generally reflected that "in the past, doing branch work and party small group work, we couldn't find the way, and the effect was poor. Now we have found the way to work."

Going to the countryside to run mobile party schools can be done together with the commune party committee and brigade party branch, which is a good way to run a school following the mass line. The commune party committee secretary and others act as teachers, and the brigade party branch secretary acts as the learning group leader, thus solving the contradiction of the lack of party school staff. Because the commune party committee secretary and other leading cadres have a comprehensive and profound understanding of the situation of the grassroots cadres in their commune, the classes they teach can be targeted and practical.

In the practice of running mobile party schools, the Yongning County Party School also tried the system of combining study with collective labor. Some commune party member training classes studied for six hours a day and worked for four hours; some studied for seven hours and worked for two hours. The party member training class in Tongqiao Commune stayed in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying water, sweeping the yard, pulling soil to build a pen, dismantling the kang (traditional Chinese bed), and husking rice, doing many good deeds. This approach was very welcome among rural party members and poor and lower-middle peasants.

Going to the grassroots to run a party school greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the party school staff. Vice Principal Zhang Ruimin, regardless of the distance, always carried his luggage to the countryside by himself and always ate, lived, worked, and studied with the students. He made many party members and poor and lower-middle peasants his close friends. (With pictures)

Seven years ago, female hero Xu Xuehui, who lost both hands in a struggle with bandits, is now the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of Kunming City's Jinri Baihuo Department Store. She actively organized young salespeople to study Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the store's staff. This is Xu Xuehui (left one) studying Chairman Mao's works with young salespeople.

    以毛主席著作为课本到基层举办巡回党校
    永宁县党校走革命化的道路，有效地提高了党员的阶级觉悟和思想水平
    据新华社银川二十八日电　宁夏回族自治区永宁县党校，打破“正规化”办校的框框，走出县城，到公社、大队举办巡回党校，使理论密切联系实际，有效地提高了党员的阶级觉悟和思想水平。
    从去年八月以来，永宁县党校已经在七个人民公社举办了九期党员训练班。这些公社的大队党支部书记、支部委员、生产队党小组长和党员队长普遍经过一次到二次的训练。另外，巡回党校还为全县七十一个生产大队培训了一批政治工作干部和党课教员。
    永宁县经过社会主义教育运动，纯洁了党支部的领导核心，壮大了党的队伍，党支委成员增加了新手，新党员也增加不少。针对这种新情况，中共永宁县委决定，必须加强党的思想建设，办好党校。党校必须走革命化的道路，要以毛主席著作为课本，到基层巡回办校，迅速提高党员的思想觉悟和工作能力。
    开始提出办巡回党校，曾遇到了一些思想障碍，如有些人觉得，下乡办党校不够“正规化”，不象党校的样子；有些农村党员迷信过去在县城办党校的那种“正规化”办法，认为巡回党校解决不了什么问题。为了摸索经验，县党校副校长张瑞敏背着行李，亲自到掌政公社进行试点。他首先深入大队和生产队，白天和社员一起劳动，晚上和贫农下中农一起开会，了解基层党组织工作上存在的问题以及农村党员的思想动向。在充分调查研究的基础上，确定了以毛主席的“老三篇”和《放下包袱，开动机器》、《全党团结起来，为实现党的任务而斗争》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等文章作为教材；每讲一课之后，就采用“小整风”的办法，联系思想和工作，进行讨论。掌政公社举办党员训练班的效果很好，党员们普遍反映说：“过去到县城上党校，光讲理论，听不大懂，收获不大。这次党校讲的课却讲到我们的‘病’上了，很解决问题”，“送上门的党校就是好！”
    经过试点证明，只要以毛主席著作为纲，以思想革命化为中心，破“怕”字当头、“我”字第一，巡回党校完全可以办好。于是，县党校坚定了下乡办党校的决心。
    八个多月来，永宁县党校到农村巡回办校的最大好处是，理论和实际联系得更紧密，做到了有的放矢。由于党校工作人员深入生产队，紧紧依靠公社党委和大队党支部，因而对基层党组织中的问题和党员中的活思想摸得清抓得准，讲课的针对性也就强了。过去在县城办党校，由于条件限制，学员之间互相不了解，现在党校搬到公社或大队，学员大都彼此了解，便于开展批评与自我批评。这对于提高党员的阶级觉悟和改造思想，能收到很大的效果。有的训练班在学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》之后，党员们普遍认识到共产党员必须全心全意为人民服务，无条件地服从党和人民的需要。大家表示决心要把头脑里的“怕”字、“我”字赶出去，把“完全”、“彻底”和“干”字装进来，做彻底的革命派。一些原来怕当干部吃亏的党员，也端正了思想，表示要全心全意为革命而工作。原来有自卑感的一些妇女党员也表示今后要和男人一样干，男人能做到的，她们也要做到，而且要做得更好。
    巡回党校还根据党支委成员新手增多，缺少工作方法的情况，组织大家学习了陈永贵写的《千条万条突出政治第一条》和周明山写的《南柳大队党支部政治工作经验》两篇文章。在学习外地工作经验的同时，巡回党校注意总结推广本地好的党支部、党小组的工作经验。学员们普遍反映说：“过去做支部工作、党小组工作，摸不到门路，效果差，现在工作有了门路。”
    下乡办巡回党校，就可以同公社党委、大队党支部一起来办，是走群众路线办校的一种好方法。公社党委书记等作教员，大队党支部书记作学习小组长，这就解决了党校工作人员少的矛盾。由于公社党委书记和其他负责干部对本公社基层干部的情况了解得全面、深刻，讲的课都能做到有的放矢，切合实际。
    在举办巡回党校的实践中，永宁县党校还试行了学习和集体劳动相结合的制度。有的公社党员训练班一天学习六小时，劳动四小时；有的学习七小时，劳动二小时。通桥公社党员训练班学员住在贫农下中农家里，为贫农下中农挑水、扫院子、拉土垫圈、拆炕、碾米，做了不少好事。这种做法，很受农村党员和贫农下中农的欢迎。
    到基层办党校，大大促进了党校工作人员的思想革命化。党校副校长张瑞敏不论路途多远，都是自己背着行李下乡，并且始终与学员同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习。他和许多党员、贫农下中农交了知心朋友。（附图片）
