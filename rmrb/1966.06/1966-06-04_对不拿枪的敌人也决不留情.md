    We of the working class must write big-character posters and paste them in front of the "Three-Family Village" black gangs like Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun! I am an old worker. During the great "February 7th" strike, under the leadership of the Party, we fought against class enemies with guns using only our bare hands. Today, the people hold power, but the enemy is not reconciled to their demise. We will never show mercy to enemies without guns like Lu Ping! The people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fear nothing!

    Comrades of Peking University, you are worthy of being revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. You have not been intimidated, demonstrating the fearless heroic spirit of "daring to unhorse the emperor at the risk of one's life"; you have not been misled, which shows that you have a keen political sense and a clear concept of class struggle. No matter who it is, as long as they are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely uproot them!

    Revolutionary youths of Peking University: I hope you firmly listen to Chairman Mao's words, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and boldly make revolution! Even if you don't go to class or sleep, you must fight the demons and monsters! Let us join hands, fight together, and firmly, firmly grasp the proletarian seal of power in our hands, and occupy all cultural and ideological fronts!

    对不拿枪的敌人也决不留情
    我们工人阶级要写大字报，并且要把大字报贴在宋硕、陆平、彭珮云等“三家村”黑帮跟前！我是一个老工人，伟大的“二七”大罢工的时候，我们在党的领导下，用赤手空拳和拿枪的阶级敌人斗争。今天，人民掌握了政权，但是，敌人还不甘心灭亡。对于陆平等这些不拿枪的敌人，我们也绝不留情！用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，什么也不怕！
    北大的同志们，你们不愧是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命者。你们没有被吓倒，表现了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的英雄气概；你们没有被迷惑，说明了你们具有敏锐的政治嗅觉和鲜明的阶级斗争观念。不管什么人，只要他反党反社会主义，反毛泽东思想，我们就坚决把他们连根拔掉！
    北京大学的革命青年们：希望你们坚决听毛主席的话，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大胆地闹革命！即使不上课，不睡觉，也要和牛鬼蛇神干！让我们拉起手来，共同战斗，把无产阶级大印牢牢地牢牢地掌握在我们手中，占领一切文化思想阵地！
      长辛店机车车辆厂“二七”老工人　刘再祥
