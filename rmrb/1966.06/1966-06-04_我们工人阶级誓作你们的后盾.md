    We, the Working Class, Vow to be Your Backing
    Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others: As soon as your big-character poster was published, the monsters and demons like Song Shuo and Lu Ping were exposed to the broad daylight. In the struggle of the Great Cultural Revolution, you were right to do this, a revolutionary act of revolutionary intellectuals, in order to defend the Party Central Committee, to defend our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and to thoroughly crush the frantic attacks of the reactionary black gang.
    What is the essence of Song Shuo and Lu Ping's "urgent need to strengthen leadership and stick to their posts"? It is to lead a group of monsters and demons, to stick to an incorrigible anti-Party, anti-socialist "fortress," to sing a counter-tune to the Party, to sabotage the Great Cultural Revolution, and to protect their "chariots and horses." We workers absolutely will not allow this group of anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs to be reckless and crazy. No matter what tricks they play, they cannot block the sharp eyes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they will surely be smashed to pieces by our iron hammers.
    The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death class struggle, a struggle of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought to destroy this handful of bourgeois black gangs. These bourgeois "authorities" have long controlled and monopolized the "historical" and "artistic" circles, using their decadent bourgeois world outlook to anesthetize and poison the people, carrying the "red flag" but opposing the red flag. Monsters and demons like Song Shuo and Lu Ping attempted to use their positions to suppress the revolutionary masses, but were ultimately seen through by seven comrades including Nie Yuanzi. Practice has proven that the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible, and any conspiracies and tricks are futile. We will definitely join the people of the whole country to sweep away all the monsters and demons and carry the proletarian revolution through to the end.
    The proletarian revolutionary intellectuals of Peking University will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and will surely unite the masses more powerfully to fight. Those who cannot see clearly for the time being will surely raise their awareness and join the ranks of the battle. The struggle of the teachers and students of Peking University against the black line will surely be victorious. A brand-new, revitalized Peking University will surely emerge. We, the working class, vow to be your backing, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, let us join hands and fight together!

### 我们工人阶级誓作你们的后盾

    我们工人阶级誓作你们的后盾
    聂元梓等同志：你们的大字报一发表，宋硕、陆平等牛鬼蛇神就暴露在光天化日之下。在文化大革命斗争中，为了保卫党中央、保卫我们敬爱的领袖毛主席、彻底打垮反动黑帮的猖狂进攻，你们这样做是对的，是革命的知识分子的革命行为。
    宋硕、陆平的“急切需要加强领导，坚守岗位”的实质是什么呢？就是要领导一群牛鬼蛇神，坚守一个顽固不化的反党反社会主义的“堡垒”，跟党唱对台戏，破坏文化大革命，保住他们的“车马”。我们工人绝对不允许他们这群反党反社会主义的黑帮任意疯狂，不管他们耍出什么花招，也挡不住工农兵群众的雪亮眼睛，必将会被我们的铁锤砸得粉碎。
    目前的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民摧毁这撮资产阶级黑帮的斗争。这些资产阶级的“权威”，长期以来控制和垄断着“史学”界和“文艺”界等，用他们腐朽的资产阶级人生观麻醉和毒害人民，扛着“红旗”反红旗。宋硕、陆平等牛鬼蛇神企图利用职权压制群众革命，但终被聂元梓等七位同志识破。实践证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵和革命知识分子是无敌的，任何阴谋诡计都是徒劳的。我们一定和全国人民一起，把一切牛鬼蛇神全部横扫干净，将无产阶级革命进行到底。
    北京大学的无产阶级革命知识分子，一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定能够更有力地团结群众进行战斗。一时还看不清的人，一定能提高自己的觉悟，参加到战斗行列中来。北大师生反对黑线的斗争，一定能够胜利。一个焕然一新的新北大必将出现。我们工人阶级誓作你们的后盾，为巩固无产阶级专政，为保卫党中央和毛主席，携起手来共同战斗吧！
