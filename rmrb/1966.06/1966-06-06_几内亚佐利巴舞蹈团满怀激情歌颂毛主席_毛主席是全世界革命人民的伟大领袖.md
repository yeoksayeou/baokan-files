    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th. The Guinean National Djoliba Dance Troupe left Harbin tonight for Nanjing for a visit and performance. Before leaving Harbin, the Deputy Director of the dance troupe, Kouyaté Sory Kandia, expressed his wishes for Chairman Mao's longevity to Chinese friends. This famous West African singer told our reporter that he is composing a song praising Chairman Mao, to extol this great leader of the world's people.
    The dance troupe spent a week performing and visiting in Harbin. On stage, during sightseeing, and in their days with Chinese friends, the Guinean artists expressed their boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao with constant excitement. During a visit to the Heilongjiang Song and Dance Troupe, stage supervisor assistant Camara Djoubril stood before Chairman Mao's portrait and said: "Chairman Mao is not only leading the Chinese people, but also guiding the people of all countries in the world to carry out revolution. He is not only the great leader and teacher of the Chinese people, but also the great leader and teacher of the people of all countries in the world who oppose imperialism, especially American imperialism, and oppose new and old colonialism."
    While touring the Songhua River, the actors Keita Manseli and Bangoura Mariama repeatedly studied the Chinese pronunciation and writing of the three characters "Mao Zhuxi" (毛主席) with Chinese actors on the yacht. Other actors of the dance troupe also excitedly gathered around to learn. The Guinean artists also cheerfully sang Chinese revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red," "The Radiance of Chairman Mao," "Inscription for Female Militia," "Strolling Through the New City," and "Commune Members are All Sunflowers" in Chinese. When the joyous atmosphere reached its climax, they could not help but raise their arms and shout together: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Deputy Director of the dance troupe Kouyaté Sory Kandia and his wife, as well as other actors, also sang "Ah, Chairman Mao, We Wish You Boundless Longevity" in Chinese again and again. They also taught this song to the Chinese actors.

    几内亚佐利巴舞蹈团满怀激情歌颂毛主席
    毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖
    新华社哈尔滨五日电　几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团今晚离开哈尔滨前往南京访问演出。在离开哈尔滨的时候，舞蹈团副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚向中国朋友表示祝愿毛泽东主席万寿无疆。这位西非著名的歌唱家告诉本社记者，他正在创作一首歌颂毛主席的歌曲，来歌颂这位世界人民伟大的领袖。
    舞蹈团在哈尔滨进行了一个星期的演出和访问。几内亚艺术家们在舞台上，在游览中，在和中国朋友相处的日子里，时时以激动的心情倾吐他们对毛主席的无限热爱和敬仰。舞蹈团在访问黑龙江歌舞团时，舞台监督助理卡马拉·乔布里尔站在毛主席画象前说：“毛主席不仅在领导中国人民，也在引导着世界各国人民进行革命。他不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖和导师，也是全世界反对帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义和反对新老殖民主义的各国人民的伟大领袖和导师。”
    几内亚艺术家们在游览松花江时，演员凯塔·芒塞里和班谷拉·马里阿玛在游艇上，向中国演员反复学习“毛主席”这三个字的中国话发音和写法。舞蹈团的另外一些演员也兴高采烈地围上来学习。几内亚的艺术家们还用中国话欢唱《东方红》、《毛主席的光辉》、《为女民兵题照》、《逛新城》、《社员都是向阳花》等中国革命歌曲。当欢乐的气氛达到高潮的时候，他们情不自禁地一起振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”舞蹈团副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚和夫人以及其他演员们，还用中国话一遍又一遍地演唱《啊，毛主席，祝您万寿无疆》。他们还把这支歌曲教给中国演员。
