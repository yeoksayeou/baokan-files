　　On May 21st, the *Jiefang Daily* published an article by Comrade Xu Rende, a second-year high school student, entitled "Looking at Deng Tuo's Black Gang's Wolfish Ambition from the Origin of the 'Three-Family Village' Black Signboard." This article is well worth reading for everyone. It is one of the countless new things full of revolutionary vigor emerging in the current rapidly developing revolutionary movement. A great high tide of socialist revolution is rising, and the whole of China is bustling with a vigorous revolutionary scene. Hundreds of millions of people are taking action to dig up the roots of capitalist restoration, smash the "Three-Family Village," and rise up to overthrow the bourgeois "authorities" and the bourgeois careerists who have infiltrated the Party. This is a major event of epoch-making significance. The policy of boldly mobilizing the masses that Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us is showing its unparalleled revolutionary power. When there are more people, their eyes are brighter, and when there are more people, their strength is greater. Under the leadership of the Party, the people's communist consciousness is synthesized into an iron fist, and wherever it strikes, the poisonous snake's nest is smashed. A middle school student, not satisfied with the already revealed materials, dug out the origin of the "Three-Family Village" signboard from Lu You's poems, revealing that the shopkeepers of the "Three-Family Village" black shop raised this signboard in order to compare themselves to feudal bureaucrats who had lost their "ten thousand households," and encouraged those right-leaning opportunists who had been "dismissed" and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to stage a comeback and implement capitalist restoration. Doesn't this fully demonstrate a young person's revolutionary nature? Doesn't this fully demonstrate a young person's fighting courage? Isn't this a good thing that all revolutionary people should be happy about from the bottom of their hearts?

　　The reason why Deng Tuo and his ilk favored the "Three-Family Village" signboard is because Lu You's poem "Village Drinking Shows Neighbors," written in 1196, contains the line "Accidentally lost ten thousand households, then aged in a three-family village," which could be borrowed to express their hatred of being "dismissed from office" and their desire to usurp power and implement capitalist restoration. Of course, they would not "age in a three-family village." Their "Three-Family Village" is a tool for implementing capitalist restoration. Their "officials" were already quite high-ranking: secretary of the municipal party committee, deputy mayor, minister of propaganda, minister of united front... Hasn't this already usurped great power? The "ten thousand households" they still want to be are actually far more than "ten thousand households," because they are representatives of the bourgeoisie, and they inevitably have greater political ambitions, which is to, with the support of their backstage bosses, oppose the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and implement a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, changing the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. The question of political power is the fundamental question of revolution. The struggle to smash the "Three-Family Village" is precisely such a sharp struggle to defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and defend the proletarian dictatorship. In his poem *Qinyuan Spring* in 1925, Comrade Mao Zedong expressed with magnificent revolutionary enthusiasm: "Pointing out the country, stirring up words, we saw the ten thousand households of those days as dung." Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, and dare to regard all the "ten thousand households" in the world who fatten themselves by drinking the people's blood, that is, all counter-revolutionaries, as dung. Now, in the new socialist China under the proletarian dictatorship, Deng Tuo and his ilk are constantly thinking about "ten thousand households." Doesn't this nakedly show their vicious intention to change the proletarian dictatorship and implement capitalist restoration? Doesn't this expose that they are political agents serving the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in their efforts to stage a comeback? Using the name "Wu Nanxing" as the public pillar of the "Three-Family Village," and taking the "Three-Family Village," which serves the counter-revolutionary restoration of those overthrown "ten thousand households," as the secret common political program of their counter-revolutionary group, this is the intention of Deng Tuo and his gang in raising the "Three-Family Village" signboard.

　　In fact, Deng Tuo and his ilk, the counter-revolutionary revisionists, are not even as good as Lu You. Lu You was an anti-Jin patriot in the Southern Song Dynasty. He also advocated using war to drive out foreign invaders. And what about Deng Tuo and his gang in the "Three-Family Village" black shop? They are the mortal enemies of the proletariat and the revolutionary people, and they are great traitors to the Chinese people who serve imperialism and modern revisionism. They want to let wolves into the house. The history of class struggle has proved that those counter-revolutionary revisionists who want to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship always seek support from foreign imperialism and its lackeys who are "stronger than themselves" as their reliance for implementing counter-revolutionary restoration. "Recognizing a thief as a father" is the psychology of the representatives of the reactionary classes who have failed but dream of restoration when they seek their allies and supporters. Didn't Deng Tuo advocate that "the way of benevolence" is better than "the way of force"? This is a malicious attack on the proletarian dictatorship and a shameless flattery of imperialism and modern revisionism. Everyone knows that praising "the way of benevolence" is the "secret of selling one's soul" of the number one foreign slave Hu Shi. He once used this to advise Japanese imperialism, using "conquering the hearts of the Chinese nation" as a magic weapon for destroying China. Later, Japanese imperialism indeed used things like "the paradise of the kingly way" as tools to buy over a group of traitors and sellouts. Under the guise of "the paradise of the kingly way" and "the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," they frantically slaughtered countless Chinese people. This is a bloody history that is unforgettable. Now Deng Tuo has come out to praise "the way of benevolence," also using this as his "secret of selling his soul," selling his soul to American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist group that has usurped power. Deng Tuo wants us to "invite teachers," to welcome "people who are stronger than ourselves," that is, to "invite" American imperialism and modern revisionism as "teachers." In August 1962, in his speech at the political cadres' study meeting of Beijing's higher education institutions, didn't Deng Tuo openly shout, "The Soviet Union is also a big country, and their construction experience is very valuable for us to refer to"? After the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, Deng Tuo vigorously wanted us to "refer to" the "experience" of Khrushchev's modern revisionist group in carrying out capitalist restoration and surrendering to American imperialism. How sinister is his intention! What a traitorous face! What is this? This is wholeheartedly wanting to rely on imperialism and revisionism, so that China will become a colony of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism!

　　Is this an isolated event? Absolutely not. In the re-edition of *A History of Famine Relief in China* (reprint) in 1961, Deng Tuo not only nakedly boasted about Chiang Kai-shek's bloody crimes of "suppressing the communists," but also tried his best to praise the so-called "good deeds" of American imperialism. He vigorously praised the "China International Famine Relief Commission" as a "charitable organization" that "revived" the "rural areas of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces" in China through "agricultural relief."① What is the "China International Famine Relief Commission"? It is an economic aggression organization controlled by American imperialism, with the transformation of China into an American colony as its guiding principle. Stuart Leighton, who later became the American "ambassador," and Hu Shi, a loyal running dog of American imperialism, were all "sponsors" of this association, that is, backstage bosses. The so-called "reviving the countryside" is to carry out a mad counterattack against the revolutionary base areas with the support of the United States and other imperialist countries. Calling cannibalism "charity" and calling slaughter "revival," how can you so shamelessly whitewash American imperialism that is stained with the blood of the Chinese people? Isn't it enough to show that you are slaves of American imperialism? This re-edition of *A History of Famine Relief in China*, which praises American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, was in June 1961. They were dizzy and thought that the proletarian dictatorship was about to "end," and they stepped up their support for the right-leaning opportunists and stepped up their efforts to find backers abroad. They viciously cursed Mao Zedong Thought and the great socialist revolution and construction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, completely in the same tone as American imperialism. This is not surprising. Their role as slaves of American imperialism did not begin today, but has been around for a long time. Wu Han, the vanguard of the "Three-Family Village," once expressed "sincere gratitude" to American imperialism? Didn't he once use the most sickening tone to praise the "Truman Doctrine on China," that is, the anti-communist, anti-revolutionary, and anti-people's policy of aggression, to the sky? Didn't he kneel down at the feet of Marshall, the head of American imperialism, praising what "May you leave in history unforgettable great achievements for our future generations"?② The Chinese people will never forget the blood debts owed by American imperialism, nor will they ever forget your despicable slave faces!

　　Please see what Meng Chao, another "brother" of the "Three-Family Village," said in *Short and Long Records* in December 1962: "The Chinese people have always loved peace. We often read in ancient books sayings like 'selling swords to buy cattle' and 'weapons melted into sunlight,' all longing for peaceful beauty... American helmets are dug up from the fields, and people prepare to destroy and melt them, recast them into hammers, sickles, buckets, and dung spoons, and use them for production and construction. Isn't this a summary of these artistic conceptions?" This is his elaboration after seeing a photograph. The core is to advocate "destroying" weapons and "melting and casting them into" production tools. Isn't this exactly the same as the slogan of national betrayal and surrender put forward by the Khrushchev revisionist group, "beat swords into ploughshares"? At a time when American imperialism is stepping up its war policy and aggression policy, at a time when the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is clamoring to "counterattack the mainland," at a time when the enemy is sharpening his knives and aiming them at the throats of the Chinese people, this group of "encyclopedists" actually asks us to "destroy" our weapons and "sell swords to buy cattle." Isn't this clearly trying to disarm our revolutionary forces so that American imperialism and its running dogs can make a comeback, drive straight in, and hand over the beautiful rivers and mountains of our motherland of 9.6 million square kilometers, becoming a colony re-enslaved by American imperialism? The so-called "peaceful beauty" is to plunge the whole of China into a sea of blood, with millions of people losing their heads. Do these counter-revolutionary revisionists have a shred of patriotism left? No, they only have the nature of running dogs and slaves. They want us to "melt weapons into sunlight," which means to let the knife of American imperialism be placed on our necks without hindrance. Where can we find even the slightest patriotic feeling of the Chinese people in them?

    “三家村”黑帮是民族败类
    劲松
    五月二十一日，《解放日报》登载了一篇高中二年级学生许仁德同志的文章，叫做《从“三家村”黑招牌的来历看邓拓黑帮的狼子野心》。这篇文章很值得大家读一读。它是当前正在迅速发展的革命运动中涌现出来的无数充满革命朝气的新事物中的一个。一个伟大的社会主义革命的高潮正在兴起，全中国热气腾腾，出现了一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。几亿人民行动起来挖掉资本主义复辟的根子，捣毁“三家村”，奋起打倒资产阶级“权威”和混进党内的资产阶级野心家，这是一件有划时代意义的大事。毛泽东同志历来教导我们的放手发动群众的方针正在显示出无比的革命威力，人多眼睛亮，人多力量大，在党的领导下，人民的共产主义觉悟合成一个铁拳，打到哪里，哪里的毒蛇窠穴就被粉碎。一位中学生不满足于已揭露的材料，从陆游的诗中挖出了“三家村”招牌的来历，揭露了“三家村”黑店的伙计们抬出这块招牌是为了把自己比作失去“万户侯”的封建官僚，鼓励那些被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子和其他反党反社会主义分子东山再起，实行资本主义复辟。这不是充分表现了一个青年人的革命性吗？这不是充分表现了一个青年人的战斗勇气吗？这不是值得一切革命的人民从心里感到高兴的好事吗？
    邓拓之流所以看中“三家村”这块招牌，是因为陆游作于一一九六年的《村饮示邻曲》中有“偶失万户侯，遂老三家村”的句子，可以借用来表达自己被“罢官”的仇恨和篡夺政权实行资本主义复辟的愿望。他们当然是不会“遂老三家村”的，他们这个“三家村”，是实行资本主义复辟的一种工具。他们的“官”已经做得不小了，市委书记处书记，副市长，宣传部长，统战部长……这不是已经篡夺了很大的权力了吗？他们还想当的“万户侯”，实际上远不止“万户”了，因为他们是资产阶级的代表人物，他们必然有更大的政治野心，这就是在后台老板支持下，反掉以毛泽东同志为首的党中央，实行全国性的反革命复辟，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。政权问题是革命的根本问题。捣毁“三家村”的斗争，正是这样一场保卫党中央、保卫毛主席、保卫无产阶级专政的尖锐斗争。毛泽东同志一九二五年在《沁园春》这首词里，就以磅礴的革命热情说过：“指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”毛泽东同志号召我们敢于斗争，敢于革命，敢于把世界上一切用喝人民的血养肥自己的“万户侯”即一切反革命派视作粪土。现在邓拓之流在无产阶级专政的社会主义的新中国，念念不忘“万户侯”，这不是露骨地表现了他们想改变无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的狠毒心肠吗？这不是暴露了他们是为地、富、反、坏、右重新上台效劳卖命的政治代理人吗？用“吴南星”的名字作为“三家村”的公开台柱，而以为那些被打倒的“万户侯”进行反革命复辟服务的“三家村”，作为他们这个反革命集团暗底里共同的政治纲领，这就是邓拓一伙人打出“三家村”招牌的用意。
    其实，邓拓之流的反革命的修正主义分子，是比陆游都不如的。陆游是南宋地主阶级中的抗金派。他还主张用战争来驱逐外族侵略者。而“三家村”大黑店里的邓拓一伙人呢？他们是无产阶级和革命人民的死敌，而且是为帝国主义和现代修正主义效劳的中国人民的大叛徒。他们要想引狼入室。阶级斗争的历史已经证明：那些要想推翻无产阶级专政的反革命的修正主义分子，总是要向外国的帝国主义及其走狗寻找“比自己强”的靠山，作为他们实行反革命复辟的依靠。“认贼作父”，这是失败了而又梦想复辟的反动阶级代表人物寻找自己同盟者和支持者时的心理。邓拓不是鼓吹什么“王道”比“霸道”好吗？这是恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政，同时无耻地吹捧帝国主义和现代修正主义。谁都知道，吹捧“王道”是头号洋奴胡适的“出卖灵魂的秘诀”，他就曾以此向日本帝国主义献策，用“征服中国民族的心”作为灭亡中国的法宝。后来日本帝国主义果然用“王道乐土”之类作为收买一批汉奸卖国贼的工具了，他们就在什么“王道乐土”“大东亚共荣圈”的鬼话下，疯狂地屠杀了无数中国人民，这是令人切齿难忘的血的历史。现在邓拓又出来吹捧“王道”，同样是以此作为自己“出卖灵魂的秘诀”，把自己灵魂出卖给美帝国主义和已经篡夺了政权的苏联现代修正主义集团。邓拓要我们“请老师”，要欢迎“比自己强的人”，就是要把美帝国主义和现代修正主义当作“老师”“请”进来。一九六二年八月，邓拓在北京市高等学校政治干部学习会上的讲话中，不是公开喊叫“苏联也是一个大国，他们的建设经验对我们很有参考价值”吗？在苏共开过二十二大之后，邓拓起劲地要我们去“参考”赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团搞资本主义复辟和向美帝国主义屈膝投降的“经验”，居心是多么险恶！真是一副叛徒嘴脸！这是什么？这是一心一意要想投靠帝国主义和修正主义，使中国沦为美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的殖民地！
    这是孤立的事件吗？绝对不是。邓拓在一九六一年再版的《中国救荒史》（重印本）中，不但赤裸裸地为蒋介石的“剿共”的血腥罪行吹嘘，而且竭力吹捧美帝国主义的所谓“善行”。他大肆吹捧“华洋义赈会”是一个“慈善团体”，用“农赈”的办法“复兴”了中国“皖、赣两省农村”①。“华洋义赈会”是个什么东西？是一个由美帝国主义控制的经济侵略机构，以变中国为美国的殖民地为自己的活动方针，后来当美国“大使”的司徒雷登以及美帝国主义忠实走狗胡适都是此会的“赞助人”，即后台老板。所谓“复兴农村”，就是在美国等帝国主义支持下，对革命根据地进行疯狂的反攻倒算。把吃人叫做“慈善”，把屠杀叫做“复兴”，你们这样无耻地为染满中国人民鲜血的美帝国主义涂脂抹粉，难道不足以说明你们是美帝国主义的奴才吗？这本吹捧美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的《中国救荒史》的再版是一九六一年六月。他们昏头昏脑地认为无产阶级专政快要“完蛋”了，加紧支持右倾机会主义者，而且加紧向国外找靠山。他们恶毒地咒骂毛泽东思想和毛泽东思想指导下的伟大的社会主义革命和建设，完全同美帝国主义一个腔调。这也没有什么奇怪。他们当美帝国主义的奴才并不是从今天开始，而是由来已久。“三家村”里的急先锋吴晗，不是曾经对美帝国主义表示“衷心感激”吗？不是曾经用最肉麻的腔调把“杜鲁门总统对华政策”即反共反革命反人民的侵略政策捧到天上去吗？他不是跪倒在美帝国主义头子马歇尔脚下，称颂什么“敬祝你在历史上留下为我们后世子孙永志不忘的伟迹”②吗？中国人民子子孙孙永远不会忘记美帝国主义欠下的血债，也永远不会忘记你们这副卑鄙的奴才面目！
    请看看“三家村”的另一名“兄弟”孟超一九六二年十二月在《长短录》中说的话：“中国人民从来就是热爱和平的，从古书上常常读到‘卖刀买牛’‘兵器销为日月光’种种憧憬着和平美景的说法；……美国钢盔从田地里翻掘出来，人们准备把它销毁熔化，改铸成锤子、镰刀、水桶、粪勺，而用之于生产建设，不正是概括了这些意境吗？”这是他看了一幅摄影后的借题发挥，中心是鼓吹把武器“销毁”，“熔铸成”生产工具。这同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团提出的“铸剑为犁”的卖国投降的口号不是一模一样吗？在美帝国主义加紧执行战争政策和侵略政策的时刻，在美蒋反动派叫嚣要“反攻大陆”的时刻，在敌人正霍霍磨刀对准中国人民咽喉的时刻，这伙“杂家”竟要求我们“销毁”武器，“卖刀买牛”，这不是明明要解除我们的革命武装，好让美帝国主义及其走狗卷土重来，长驱直入，把祖国九百六十万平方公里的锦绣河山拱手让人，成为重新被美帝国主义奴役的殖民地吗？所谓“和平美景”，就是使全中国沦在血海之中，千百万人民人头落地。这些反革命的修正主义分子，还有一丝一毫爱国主义没有呢？没有了，他们身上只有走狗性和奴才性，他们要我们“兵器销为日月光”，就是要美帝国主义的刀不受阻碍地架到我们脖子上来。他们身上哪里还找得到一点点中国人民起码的爱国感情呢？
    毛泽东同志早就说过：那些顽固地要走资本主义路线的人，“……实际上是准备投降帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人”。（《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》）“三家村”的那些搞资本主义复辟的政治野心家，也就是已经或准备投靠美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的人。他们不是一再自命为“东林党”吗？邓拓不是鼓吹过“东林党人在政治上的抱负”吗？不是在诗里赞美“东林一代好男儿”吗？的确，把邓拓之流比作“东林党”的“巨头”钱谦益，倒是很恰当的。钱谦益在清兵入关之前，高唱所谓“忠烈”“气节”，以“反对派”自命，但是清兵一打进来，他就“率先投顺”当了大汉奸。乾隆骂他是“有才无行之人”“实不足齿于人类”③，这位新主子看透了这个老叛徒卖国贼的卑鄙心理。邓拓之流不是也很以自己的“才”自夸吗？他们不是也洋洋得意地写了一批反革命的歪诗吗？其实，他们所谓的“才”，就是卖身投靠的“才”，他们既然可以叛变党，投降国民党反动派；当然在帝国主义或修正主义打过来时也会叛变社会主义祖国，投降外国反动派。这种卖身投靠的奴才行为，是连反革命主子也瞧不起的。一切叛徒都是“实不足齿于人类”的家伙。什么“骨气”“刚直”，只是反党时用的毒箭；在帝国主义及其走狗面前，他们不但没有丝毫骨气，而且是一批最没有骨头的奴才！
    粉碎“三家村”黑帮的激烈斗争，是无产阶级和广大革命人民同一小撮反革命修正主义分子之间的你死我活的斗争。这一小撮人，是无产阶级和革命人民的敌人，也是我们民族的败类。他们是帝国主义和现代修正主义的内应，是埋伏在党内的资本主义复辟的定时炸弹。如果他们的阴谋得逞，劳动人民就要被推进血海，中国就要沦为向美帝国主义屈膝投降的、被法西斯恐怖统治的修正主义国家。我们借支持一位中学生同志揭发“三家村”招牌来历的一篇文章说了这番话，就是希望大家更深刻地看清楚这一伙人的反动面目，坚决把这场关系到中国和世界人民前途和命运的大革命进行到底，把那些混入革命队伍的反革命的修正主义分子一个一个地揪出来，使无产阶级专政进一步加强和巩固起来。
