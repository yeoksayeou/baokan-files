　　"The Twenty-One Major Crimes of the College Entrance Examination System"
　　Changsha City No. 1 Middle School, Senior Third (3) Class Communist Youth League Branch
    Changsha City No. 1 Middle School, Senior Third (3) Class Communist Youth League Branch, sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on June 7, suggesting that a proposal be made to graduating senior high school students and all students nationwide to launch a large-scale discussion on the college entrance examination system, and completely destroy the "college entrance examination," this stubborn fortress of the bourgeois education system. In their proposal, they listed twenty-one major crimes of the college entrance examination system:
    One, the remnants and variations of the feudal imperial examination system. The feudal society's imperial examination system was used by a small handful of people to "test at each level, rise step by step," combining the filth of the Four Books and Five Classics, and the Three Religions and Nine Schools. This remnant constantly changes its banner, becoming the so-called "stage exams," "final exams," "entrance exams," and "college entrance exams" of today. In fact, they are all fancy signboards, remnants and variations of the feudalist political and economic product, which are vigorously promoted and followed by the bourgeois "authorities" in the education circles.
    Two, opening the door wide for implementing the bourgeois education line. In order to prepare for the exam, the time for political activities and studying Chairman Mao's works is cut down, the time for going to the countryside to work is squeezed, and even this Great Cultural Revolution was only suspended for ten days, and then for twenty days "we still review lessons and prepare for the exam."
    Three, a product of the revisionist education system in China. What the college entrance examination system brings is "injection-style" teaching, printing large amounts of review outlines, and rote memorization of books. This is a product of the revisionist education system in China.
    Four, hindering young people from integrating with the workers and peasants. Once the exam approaches, many students don't want to think about integrating with the workers and peasants anymore, and are unwilling to "make time" to share weal and woe and labor with the workers and peasants. Chairman Mao said: "All intellectuals who can work in the countryside should be happy to go there." However, the vast majority of students are wholeheartedly focused on the "college entrance exam." Those who pass are happy, and those who fail are dissatisfied and unwilling to go to the countryside.
    Five, creating "soil" for revisionism. Encouraging young people to pursue higher education for small Western-style houses, small cars, and small families, and to strive to stay in big cities after graduation. This is promoting the revisionist "peaceful evolution."
    Six, "Political exams" are divorced from proletarian politics. The political exams in the "college entrance examination" also have review outlines. Whether you do well or not depends on how many rules you can memorize. I ask: What kind of political exam is this? Can this be considered proletarian politics?
    Seven, opposing emphasizing proletarian politics and vigorously emphasizing bourgeois politics. Making young people bury themselves in books, not ask about politics, not put politics first, but put getting into college first; not leading with ideology, but putting scores in command.
    Eight, attacking revolutionary forces and carrying out class retaliation. The monsters and demons that were ferreted out in our school this time used excuses such as "poor grades," "low scores," and "bad college entrance examination results" to maliciously satirize, ridicule, and curse the children of workers and peasants and members of the Youth League and cadres, saying that they had "messed up politically," were "stupid," and were "chicken feathers that couldn't fly to the sky."
    Nine, various frameworks restricting students from "studying vividly, actively, and initiatively." Wholeheartedly for the "college entrance exam," all teaching outlines and textbooks are from books to books, from theory to theory, from school to school. They can draw circuit diagrams proficiently in physics class, but they can't even install a light bulb.
    Ten, the education revolution cannot be thoroughly carried out, and teaching reforms cannot be successfully reformed, because many systems in teaching are ultimately for the sake of the exam. "If you want to face reality, we won't let you get into college!" Those bourgeois "authorities" are doing everything possible to obstruct teaching reform around the "college entrance examination."
    Eleven, the tense review and examination process oppresses students so that they cannot breathe, making them bury themselves in books and get caught up in the business obsession, and have no time and energy to devote themselves to the three great revolutionary movements.
    Twelve, advocating taking chances and clutching at straws at the last minute. Some students have memorized the history book page by page in the review for the exam, and achieved "excellent results" in the "history exam" of the "college entrance exam," deceiving the country, the Party, and the people, and got into university to engage in "first interest in spare time" - writing novels.
    Thirteen, peddling anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois black goods. The "college entrance exam" questions are all purely professional things vigorously promoted by bourgeois "authorities," guiding students to delve into difficult problems and memorize rules. The political exams test things that are divorced from reality; history is completely the same as the set of Jian Bozan and his ilk.
    Fourteen, praising some monsters and demons and speculative guys who can guess exam questions to the sky. Peng Jing, a Kuomintang secret agent and current counter-revolutionary, once controlled the leadership of the Chinese language teaching and research group in our school. And the head of the political teaching and research group, because he guessed the political exam questions correctly, the candidates shouted "Long live!" when they left the examination hall.
    Fifteen, paying lip service to the implementation of the class line and distorting the policy of emphasizing performance. The "college entrance examination" has always used scores to choke the necks of the children of workers and peasants, while opening the door for bourgeois successors, and saying "the children of the exploiting classes can get into college, which means emphasizing performance."
    Sixteen, destroying students' physical health. Desperately reviewing before the exam, some have gone crazy, some have fainted in the examination room. "One exam loses a layer of skin," neurasthenia, nearsightedness.
    Seventeen, extravagance and waste. Conducting a "college entrance examination" wastes unknown amounts of manpower, materials, financial resources, and time.
    Eighteen, advocating material incentives. Invigilators and graders receive an extra three yuan per day in addition to their monthly salary. A teacher, in order to win people's hearts and cheat money from superiors, distributed it to the voluntary workers in the examination room.
    Nineteen, a whole set of sophistry. Planning, drafting questions, printing, transporting, preparing the examination room, arranging staff, gathering graders, and so on, complicated and complicated!
    Twenty, teachers teach for the sake of getting students into college, and students study for the sake of getting into college. The "hopes" of teachers and the "future" and "ideals" of students are all pinned on those few tens of minutes, few hours, few days in the examination room that "determines destiny."
    Twenty-one, a great obstacle to the ideological revolutionization of young students. The college entrance examination system is the most stubborn fortress in the battle of students to break with the old ideology, and also a major stumbling block in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### “升学考试制度的二十一大罪状”

    “升学考试制度的二十一大罪状”
　　长沙市一中高三（三）班共青团支部
    长沙市一中高三（三）班共青团支部，六月七日给团中央来信，建议向全国高中应届毕业生和全体学生发出倡议，对高考制度问题展开大讨论，彻底摧毁“升学考试”这座资产阶级教育制度的顽固堡垒。他们在倡议书中，列举了升学考试制度的二十一大罪状：
    一、封建科举制度的流毒和变种。封建社会的科举制度就是一小撮人“层层考试，步步高升”，把四书五经、三教九流污秽合一。这种流毒不断改换旗号，变成如今的什么“阶段考”、“期终考”、“升学考”、“高考”，其实都是花花招牌，是封建主义政治和经济产物的流毒和变种，是教育界的资产阶级“权威”所极力吹捧和奉行的。
    二、为推行资产阶级教育路线大开方便之门。为了准备考试，砍削政治活动和学习毛主席著作的时间，压挤下乡劳动时间，就连这场文化大革命也只停课十天，而后二十天“还是复习功课，准备考试”。
    三、修正主义教育制度在中国的产物。升学考试制度所带来的，是教学上的“注入式”，大印复习提纲，死背书本。这是修正主义教育制度在中国的产物。
    四、阻挠青年与工农群众相结合。一临考试，许多同学就不想与工农相结合的事了，就不愿“抽时间”去和工农群众共甘苦，同劳动了。毛主席说：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。”而绝大多数同学一心一意为了“高考”，考上的就高兴，考不上的就不满，不愿下乡。
    五、产生修正主义的“土壤”。助长青年为小洋房、小汽车、小家庭而追求升学，为毕业能留在大城市而奋斗。这是在推行修正主义的“和平演变”。
    六、“政治考试”脱离了无产阶级政治。“升学考试”中的政治考试也有复习提纲，考得好不好，就看你背得了多少条条。试问：这算什么政治考试？这能算是无产阶级政治吗？
    七、反对突出无产阶级政治，极力突出资产阶级政治。使青年埋头读书，不问政治，不搞政治第一，而是搞升学第一；不是思想领先，而是分数挂帅。
    八、打击革命力量，进行阶级报复。我校这次揪出来的牛鬼蛇神，就是以什么“成绩不好”、“分数不高”、“高考成绩坏”为借口，恶毒地讽刺、挖苦、咒骂工农子弟和团员、干部，说他们是“政治搞糟了”，是“蠢货”，是“上不了天的鸡毛”。
    九、各种框框，束缚学生“生动活泼主动地学习”。一心为“高考”，什么教学大纲，教科书，都是从书本到书本，从理论到理论，从学校到学校。物理课上电路图画得烂熟，却连安盏电灯都不会。
    十、教育革命革不到底，教改改不成功，就是因为教学中的很多制度最终都是为了考试。“你要面向实际，就不让你升学！”那些资产阶级“权威”就是围绕“升学考试”百般阻挠教改。
    十一、紧张的复习考试，压得学生喘不过气来，使他们埋头于书本之中，钻入业务迷魂阵，根本没有时间和精力投身三大革命运动。
    十二、提倡侥幸取胜，临时抱佛脚。曾有学生在复习考试中把历史书一页一页背得滚瓜烂熟，在“高考”的“历史考试”中获得“特好成绩”，欺骗了国家、党和人民，钻入了大学，去搞“业余时间第一兴趣”——写长篇小说。
    十三、贩卖反党反社会主义的资产阶级黑货。“高考”的试题都是资产阶级“权威”所极力提倡的纯业务的东西，引导学生钻难题，背条条。政治考试，考的都是脱离实际的；历史则完全是翦伯赞之流那一套。
    十四、把一些牛鬼蛇神和会猜考题的投机的家伙捧上天。中统特务、现行反革命分子彭靖，曾经一度把持了我校语文教研组的领导权。而政治教研组长，曾经因连猜中政治考题，考生出场时喊他“万岁！”
    十五、对贯彻阶级路线阳奉阴违，歪曲重在表现的政策。“升学考试”历来利用分数来卡工农子弟的脖子，而为资产阶级接班人开门，还说什么“剥削阶级子女能升学，就是重在表现”。
    十六、摧残同学的身体健康。考前拼命复习，有发疯的，有昏倒考场的。“考一次瘦一身肉”，神经衰弱了，眼睛近视了。
    十七、铺张浪费。搞一次“高考”，不知要浪费多少人力、物力、财力和时间。
    十八、提倡物质刺激。监考老师评卷，除了月薪以外，每人每天加三元。有个老师为了笼络人心，骗取上级的钱，发给考场义务工作人员。
    十九、一整套烦琐哲学。筹划，拟题，印刷，运送，准备考场，安排工作人员，调集阅卷老师，如此等等，烦琐又烦琐！
    二十、教师为升学而教，学生为升学而学。教师的“希望”，学生的“前途”、“理想”，全寄托于那“决定命运”的考场上的几十分钟、几小时、几天。
    二十一、青年学生思想革命化的大阻碍。升学考试制度是同学们与旧意识形态决裂战役中一个最顽固的堡垒，也是无产阶级文化大革命中一块大绊脚石。
