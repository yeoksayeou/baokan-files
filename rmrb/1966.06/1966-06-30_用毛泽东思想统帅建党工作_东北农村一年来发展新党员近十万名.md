	Over the past year, nearly 100,000 new party members have been developed in the rural areas of Northeast China. These new party members have firm political stands, high consciousness, and love for the collective. After joining the party, they have enhanced the fighting capacity of the grassroots party organizations in rural areas and will play an active role in adhering to the socialist path and developing the collective economy.

	The New China News Agency reported from Shenyang on the 29th that the grassroots party organizations in various places in Northeast China have, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on party-building work, developed nearly 100,000 Communist Party members over the past year. Most of these new party members are "five-good" members, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, and advanced figures who have emerged in the three great revolutionary movements.

	After the party organizations in various places in Northeast China accepted these new party members, the number of party members on the production front increased significantly. Some production teams that previously had no party members now have them. These party members have firm political stands, high consciousness, and love for the collective. After joining the party, they have enhanced the fighting capacity of the grassroots party organizations in rural areas and will play an active role in adhering to the socialist path and developing the collective economy.

	The most fundamental experience of the grassroots party organizations in rural areas in Northeast China in developing party members is to emphasize politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide party-building work, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on party-building work. The experience of many places shows that where the study and application of Chairman Mao's works are placed at the forefront of all work, and where his party-building instructions are strictly followed, the growth of activists is rapid, and the work of accepting new party members is well done. The grassroots party organizations in various places, in the process of developing party members, have linked the current new situation of domestic and international class struggle, seriously and repeatedly organized party members to study Chairman Mao's instructions on party-building work, and further clarified the great significance of developing party members for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In this way, party members have become more conscious of caring for the development of the party organization and actively doing a good job in cultivating and educating activists.

	In the process of cultivating and educating activists, various places have seriously organized activists to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform non-proletarian thoughts, so that they can establish a communist worldview of not seeking fame or personal gain, not fearing hardship or death, and wholeheartedly devoting themselves to the revolution and serving the people wholeheartedly. The most effective way to transform one's worldview is to let them express their thoughts and study and apply Chairman Mao's works with their problems in mind. The party organizations in various places have also closely combined the socialist education movement to cultivate and temper activists, so that they can continuously improve their class consciousness in the struggle and become vanguard fighters of the proletariat.

	In the process of developing party members, various places have strictly followed the party constitution, insisted on the standards for party members, and universally sought the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants. In this way, both the quality of party members is guaranteed, and the masses are educated, and the relationship between the party and the masses is strengthened.

    用毛泽东思想统帅建党工作
    东北农村一年来发展新党员近十万名
    这些新党员立场坚定，觉悟较高，热爱集体。他们入党后，提高了农村基层党组织的战斗力，在坚持走社会主义道路和发展集体经济等方面，起了积极作用
    新华社沈阳二十九日电　东北各地农村基层党组织按照党中央和毛主席有关建党工作的指示，一年来发展了近十万名共产党员。这些新党员大部分是“五好”社员、学习毛主席著作积极分子和三大革命运动中涌现出来的先进人物。
    东北各地党组织接收这些新党员以后，生产第一线上的党员普遍增多。有些没有党员的生产队，现在有了党员。这些党员立场坚定，觉悟较高，热爱集体。他们入党以后，提高了农村基层党组织的战斗力，在坚持走社会主义道路和发展集体经济等方面，将会起着积极的作用。
    东北各地农村基层党组织发展党员工作的最根本经验就是突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅建党工作，坚决贯彻毛主席的有关建党工作的指示。许多地方经验表明，哪里把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，严格按照毛主席的建党指示办事，哪里的积极分子就成长得快，接收新党员工作就做得好。各地基层党组织，在发展党员工作中，都联系当前国内外阶级斗争的新形势，认真地反复地组织党员学习毛主席的有关建党工作的指示，进一步明确了发展党员对社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大意义。这样，党员就更加自觉地关心党组织的发展，积极做好培养和教育积极分子的工作。
    各地在培养教育积极分子过程中，认真组织积极分子活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想不断改造非无产阶级思想，使他们树立起不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，全心全意为人民的共产主义世界观。而改造世界观最有效的办法，就是让他们把思想亮出来，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。各地党组织还紧密结合社会主义教育运动来培养锻炼积极分子，使他们在斗争中不断提高阶级觉悟，成为无产阶级的先锋战士。
    各地在发展党员工作中，严格按照党章办事，坚持党员标准，还普遍征求贫农下中农的意见。这样，既保证了党员质量，也使群众受到教育，密切了党和群众的关系。
