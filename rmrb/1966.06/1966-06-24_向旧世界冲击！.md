    Revolutionary students of Shenyang No. 11 Middle School, cheering the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination method, with passion and vigor, sent a big-character poster of support to their comrades-in-arms in Beijing.
    To all revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 4 Middle School:
    When we heard your proposal on the radio, we were extremely excited. Although it was already late at night, we still stayed by the radio listening, listening to the voices of our comrades-in-arms from the capital. Your proposal, and the one from the Women's No. 1 Middle School, are well-made and correct. We agree with them wholeheartedly.
    Dear comrades, revolutionary partners: Your proposal expresses our heartfelt wishes. The old education system has always seriously hindered our development in the direction of revolutionization. This sinful old system excludes many children of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary soldiers from the gates of universities. This education system leads us onto the white and expert road of bourgeois individual struggle, "becoming famous," and "establishing a family." Today, the time has come for us proletarian revolutionary youths to thoroughly settle accounts with it. We must fiercely fire at all old systems, seize back the education front occupied by the bourgeoisie, and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Dear partners, revolutionary comrades: Although we are thousands of miles apart, our hearts are closely linked together. Let us charge against the old world together! Let all the monsters and demons tremble under our feet!
    Let us jointly wish our greatest leader Chairman Mao a long life, without bounds!
    Some students of Senior Three (3) Class, Shenyang No. 11 Middle School

    向旧世界冲击！
    沈阳市第十一中学的革命学生，欢呼党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定，他们热情激荡、意气风发，给北京的战友寄来了支持的大字报。北京四中全体革命师生：
    当我们从收音机里听到了你们的倡议时，我们万分激动。虽然已是深夜，但我们仍旧守在收音机旁倾听，倾听来自首都的战友的声音。你们和女一中的倡议提得好，提得对，我们十二分赞成。
    亲爱的同志，革命的伙伴：你们的倡议道出了我们的心声。旧的教育制度一直严重地阻碍着我们向革命化方向发展。这种罪恶的旧制度把许多工人、贫下中农、革命干部和革命军人的子女拒于大学的大门之外。这种教育制度把我们引向资产阶级个人奋斗、“成名”、“成家”的白专道路。今天，我们无产阶级革命青年向它彻底清算的时候来到了。我们要向一切旧制度猛烈地开火，夺回被资产阶级占领的教育阵地，插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    亲爱的伙伴，革命的同志：虽然我们远隔千里，但我们的心却紧紧地联在一起，让我们一齐向旧世界冲击吧！让一切牛鬼蛇神在我们脚下发抖吧！
    让我们共同祝福我们最伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    沈阳市第十一中学  高三（三）班部分同学
