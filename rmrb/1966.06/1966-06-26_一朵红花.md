    Our culture is the people's culture, and cultural workers must have a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people, must be in contact with the masses, and must not be divorced from the masses.
                       Mao Zedong
    A Red Flower
    Wang Renzhong
    Comrade Xia Juhua was a poor child who suffered and was devastated in the old society. China has been liberated, and she has also been liberated from suffering. The contrast between the old and new societies is so obvious! Comrade Xia Juhua, because of her hatred for the old society, especially loves the new society. She is grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and grateful to those heroes and martyrs who struggled hard and sacrificed heroically for the revolutionary cause. From a simple class feeling of gratitude, through the education of the Party, she has gradually grown into a conscious proletarian revolutionary fighter. She understands that acrobatics is no longer a plaything for the idle class to enjoy, no longer a means of begging for a living, but a revolutionary weapon for serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Comrade Xia Juhua's acrobatic performances have not only been well received in China, but also in performances in several continents and more than a dozen countries abroad, they have been highly praised. It is not an exaggeration to compare her to a red flower in the literary and art circles of New China. When we compare Comrade Xia Juhua to a red flower, we first and foremost look at the redness of her thought, not just the beauty of her performing arts. The beauty of her performing arts is obvious to all. But the beauty of her thought and her character is not understood by all audiences. Today, the *Hubei Daily* published Comrade Xia Juhua's article. She described her growth process, and how she drew strength from Chairman Mao's works to improve her consciousness and enable herself to climb the peak of acrobatic art. This is exactly what comrades in all walks of life should learn from.
    Comrade Xia Juhua is an artist who is both red and expert. She can be called a noble person who has gotten rid of low-level tastes, a pure person. She has received high honors both at home and abroad. But she is not proud, not complacent, not special; she still maintains the simple style of an ordinary worker. This is strange and incomprehensible in the eyes of foreign bourgeoisie. But our Party and our people understand her. She is living, studying, working, and struggling according to the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. She attributes all honors to the collective, to the Party, and to the people. What she thinks about is the interests of the people and the honor of the motherland. For herself, she is strict in her demands, constantly learning, constantly revolutionizing, and striving for perfection.
    Comrade Xia Juhua is not only a bright red flower in the garden of proletarian literature and art, but also a good example for all our revolutionary workers to learn from.

    我们的文化是人民的文化，文化工作者必须有为人民服务的高度的热忱，必须联系群众，而不要脱离群众。

    一朵红花

    夏菊花同志，在旧社会是一个受苦、受摧残的穷孩子。中国解放了，她也从苦难中被解放出来。新旧社会的对比，多么明显！夏菊花同志，由于对旧社会的痛恨，就特别热爱新社会。她感谢共产党和毛主席，感谢那些为革命事业而艰苦奋斗英勇牺牲的英雄、烈士。从感恩的朴素的阶级感情，经过党的教育，逐渐成长为自觉的无产阶级革命战士。她懂得了杂技艺术不再是为有闲阶级开心的玩艺，不再是讨饭吃的手段，而是为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务的革命武器。
    夏菊花同志的杂技表演艺术，不仅在国内得到好评，而且在国外几大洲，十几个国家的演出，都受到很高的赞扬。把她比做新中国文艺界的一朵红花，是一点也不过分的。我们把夏菊花同志比做一朵红花，首先不是看她表演艺术的美，而是说她思想的红。她的表演艺术的美，是人所共见的。但是她的思想和她的品格的美，并不是观众都了解的。今天《湖北日报》发表了夏菊花同志的文章。她叙述了自己成长的过程，讲了怎样从毛主席著作中汲取力量，提高觉悟，使自己向杂技艺术的高峰攀登。这正是值得我们各行各业的同志学习的地方。
    夏菊花同志是一位又红又专的艺术家。她称得上是摆脱了低级趣味的高尚的人，纯粹的人。她在国内国外都得到了很高的荣誉。但是她丝毫不骄傲，不自满，不特殊；仍然保持着一个普通劳动者的纯朴作风。这在外国资产阶级看来是奇怪的，不可理解的。但是我们的党，我们的人民了解她。她是按照党和毛主席的教导，在生活、学习、工作、斗争。她把一切荣誉归功于集体，归功于党，归功于人民。她所想到的是人民的利益，是祖国的荣誉。对于自己则是严格要求，不断学习，不断革命，精益求精。
    夏菊花同志，不仅是无产阶级文艺的百花园中的一朵鲜艳的大红花，而且是我们一切革命工作者应当学习的一个好榜样。
