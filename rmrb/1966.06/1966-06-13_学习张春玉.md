    Learning from Zhang Chunyu (Shu Lai Bao)
　　Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army　Xu Zhiyi
    A: Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly,
    Thousands of heroes are growing.
    B: We learn from the heroes,
    Today we sing about Zhang Chunyu.
    A: Zhang Chunyu is a student,
    Who joined the railway corps in 1963.
    He studies Chairman Mao's writings well,
    And has a firm grasp of proletarian ideology.
    B: We are carrying out a new task,
    To build a railway in the forest area.
    A: Zhang Chunyu has many heroic deeds,
    Let's talk about them with bamboo clappers.
    Once, building a temporary bridge,
    We needed large timber for driving piles.
    We received a new task,
    To saw big trees in the forest.
    Entering the forest, I started to saw,
    But Zhang Chunyu stopped me.
    B: (White) Why?
    A: I left the stump two inches high,
    He wanted me to saw lower.
    B: (White) It has to be lower.
    A: You are too stingy, comrade,
    It’s easier to saw if it's a bit higher.
    There are plenty of trees in the forest,
    One or two inches doesn’t matter.
    Zhang Chunyu said to me:
    Chairman Mao's teachings cannot be forgotten,
    Building the country through diligence and frugality is the policy,
    Keep increasing production and practicing economy in mind.
    If each tree is sawn two centimeters less,
    The accumulation will be astonishing.
    We can’t just aim for speed in our work,
    We must cherish the country's resources.
    B: Zhang Chunyu, you spoke well,
    You quickly correct yourself and make a self-criticism.
    A: I correct myself, I make a self-criticism,
    I run around in the forest,
    Telling all the comrades to know,
    Don't leave the stumps too high.
    B: Once, I went to work on construction,
    And tore a big hole in my cotton pants.
    The cold wind blew straight into my pants,
    Making me shiver all over.
    A: (White) Quickly sew it up.
    B: At that time, I had just joined the army,
    And hadn't learned to mend clothes yet.
    A: (White) What to do then?
    B: Who knew, the next day,
    That hole was nowhere to be found.
    A: (White) What's going on?
    B: I bent down to look carefully,
    And found the hole had been sewn up.
    A: (White) Who sewed it?
    B: I inquired and found out,
    Zhang Chunyu didn't sleep last night.
    He stitched it, thread by thread,
    Until half past one.
    A: Class brothers are close and dear,
    Zhang Chunyu truly cares for his comrades.
    B: Later, the squad leader spoke at the meeting,
    And we were both praised.
    A: (White) You were also praised?
    B: He taught me how to do needlework,
    I can mend clothes myself.
    I learn from his good ideology,
    And often help my comrades.
    Taking apart quilts, mending clothes,
    Do you think this is appropriate?
    A: (White) Should be praised.
    He treats his comrades with kindness,
    And hates the enemy to the bone.
    The troops stopped construction to conduct training,
    He developed two corns on his feet.
    Just as the corns were operated on,
    He was very distressed lying in bed.
    B: (White) Why?
    A: American imperialism in South Vietnam,
    Is killing, setting fires, and plundering,
    Escalating the war step by step,
    And vainly attempting to dominate the world.
    The fire of hatred burns in his heart,
    He practices his skills to kill the enemy.
    B: How does he practice lying in bed?
    Tell everyone about it.
    A: He thought of a good idea,
    And pasted a head target on the wall,
    With a picture of an American bandit dog on the target,
    He feels angry when he looks at it.
    He thinks of the hero Huang Jiguang,
    Whose red heart shines brightly.
    B: He takes heroes as examples,
    And learns the good ideology of heroes.
    Chairman Mao calls on us to learn from Lei Feng,
    He is very happy in his heart.
    He often says:
    Lei Feng and I are two melons on the same vine,
    Both grew up in bitter water.
    Before liberation, landlords treated us poor people like cattle and horses,
    Suffering exploitation and oppression.
    The Communist Party led the poor people to turn over,
    Only in the new society can we be masters of our own affairs.
    We must not forget the bitterness, not forget our roots,
    And serve the people wholeheartedly.
    A: (White) Right!
    He has a saying that I remember clearly,
    Be the first to volunteer to go to arduous places!
    B: First place, take the lead,
    Is a good style of rushing to shoulder heavy burdens.
    A: Every time the troops go to set up camp,
    He rushes to sign up.
    Once, he wasn't allowed to go to set up camp,
    And he was very anxious.
    B: (White) Why?
    A: He said setting up camp is the most difficult,
    And I should be allowed to go and train.
    B: Chairman Mao's teachings are firmly remembered,
    The more difficult the place, the more you must go!
    A: The company approved his registration,
    He was jumping and hopping.
    Through jungles, across mountains,
    Erecting tents, building trails,
    Building houses, building stoves,
    Starting fires and cooking meals,
    He still feels he is not doing enough.
    B: He often says that to make revolution, you must eliminate "I,"
    And do more work for the Party and the people.
    A: Building trails is the hardest work,
    Frozen soil and rocks are equally hard.
    He swung the iron pickaxe and dug hard,
    Sweat soaked his cotton coat.
    One pickaxe stroke after another,
    Large blisters rose on his hands,
    The blisters burst without a sound.
    Comrades advised him to see a doctor,
    He said I am a student soldier,
    Hard training is most important.
    B: Comrade Zhang Chunyu speaks well,
    We must transform ourselves through labor,
    Transform ideology and change feelings,
    This is a good way to revolutionize.
    A: He also said, although we suffer a little,
    One person's hardship brings happiness to ten thousand.
    To develop the forest and build the motherland,
    Hard labor is the greatest joy!
    Digging through layers of hard soil,
    Building steel railways through the forest.
    B: Communist Party member Zhang Chunyu,
    Firmly remembers the Party's teachings.
    A: Zhang Chunyu, good ideology,
    Firmly stands on the class position.
    B: Zhang Chunyu, good ideology,
    Wholeheartedly for the public, high awareness.
    A: Zhang Chunyu, good ideology,
    He chooses the heavy burdens to carry.
    B: Zhang Chunyu, good ideology,
    Can endure great hardship and hard work.
    A: All good things come down to one good thing,
    B: He studies Chairman Mao's works well!
    Together: We learn from him,
    First, we must learn his love for Chairman Mao,
    We must study Chairman Mao's works seriously,
    Swear to be successors to the revolution,
    Swear to be successors to the revolution.

    乙：我们执行新任务，
    去到林区修铁路。
    甲：张春玉英雄事迹多，
    打起竹板说一说。
    有一回，架便桥，
    打桩需要用大木料。
    我们接受个新任务，
    到森林里去锯大树。
    进森林，我动手锯，
    张春玉拉住不愿意。
    乙：（白）为什么？
    甲：树桩我留高两寸长，
    他要我把锯往下放。
    乙：（白）是得往下放。
    甲：你这位同志太小气，
    放高一点好拉锯。
    森林里大树有的是，
    一寸两寸没关系。
    张春玉，他对我讲：
    毛主席教导不能忘，
    勤俭建国是方针，
    增产节约记在心。
    一棵树少锯两公寸，
    积少成多就惊人。
    干工作不能图轻快，
    国家资财要珍爱。
    乙：张春玉，说得好，
    你赶快改正做检讨。
    甲：我改正，我检讨，
    我在森林里面到处跑，
    告诉同志们都知道，
    树桩千万不要留太高。
    乙：有一回，我去施工，
    棉裤扯了个大窟窿。
    寒风直往裤里钻，
    冻的我浑身直打颤。
    甲：（白）快缝缝吧。
    乙：那时候，我刚入伍，
    还没学会补衣服。
    甲：（白）那怎么办？
    乙：谁知道，第二天，
    那个窟窿找不见。
    甲：（白）怎么回事？
    乙：我弯下腰，仔细瞧，
    原来窟窿已缝好。
    甲：（白）谁缝的呀？
    乙：我一打听才知道，
    张春玉昨晚半夜没睡觉。
    他一针针，一线线，
    一直缝到一点半。
    甲：阶级兄弟亲又亲，
    张春玉对待同志真关心。
    乙：后来班长在会上讲，
    俺俩一块受表扬。
    甲：（白）还表扬你了？
    乙：他教我学会了做针线，
    缝缝补补我能干。
    我学习他的好思想，
    经常给同志们来帮忙。
    拆被子，补衣裳，
    你说这事应当不应当？
    甲：（白）应该表扬。
    他对待同志亲又亲，
    对待敌人刻骨恨。
    部队停止施工搞训练，
    他脚上长了两鸡眼。
    正好鸡眼开了刀，
    他躺在床上很苦恼。
    乙：（白）为什么？
    甲：美帝国主义在南越，
    杀人放火又掠夺，
    逐步升级把战争来扩大，
    妄想在全世界来称霸。
    仇恨的怒火烧心间，
    他把杀敌的本领练。
    乙：他躺在床上怎么练？
    你给大家谈一谈。
    甲：他想了一个好办法，
    在墙上贴了个人头靶，
    靶上画着美国狗强盗，
    他看着心里怒火烧。
    他想起英雄黄继光，
    一颗红心亮堂堂。
    乙：他以英雄为榜样，
    学习英雄的好思想。
    毛主席号召学雷锋，
    他的心里很高兴。
    他常说：
    我和雷锋是一根藤上两个瓜，
    都是在苦水里面来长大。
    解放前，地主把咱穷人当牛马，
    受尽了剥削和压榨。
    共产党领导穷人翻了身，
    新社会才当家作主人。
    要不忘苦，不忘本，
    全心全意为人民。
    甲：（白）对！
    他有句话，我记的清，
    到艰苦的地方要报第一名！
    乙：第一名，打先锋，
    是抢挑重担的好作风。
    甲：部队每次去设营，
    他争先恐后来报名。
    有一回，设营没有让他去，
    他的心里很着急。
    乙：（白）为什么？
    甲：他说设营最艰难，
    应该让我去锻炼。
    乙：毛主席教导牢牢记，
    越是困难的地方越要去！
    甲：连里批准他把名报，
    他又是蹦来又是跳。
    穿丛林，越山岭，
    架帐篷，修便道，
    盖房子，垒锅灶，
    生火做饭一大套，
    他还嫌自己干的少。
    乙：他常说，干革命就要去掉“我”，
    要多为党和人民做工作。
    甲：修便道，活最重，
    冻土和岩石一般硬。
    他抡铁镐使劲刨，
    汗水湿透他棉袄。
    一镐一镐又一镐，
    手上磨起大血泡，
    血泡磨烂不吱声。
    同志们劝他找医生，
    他说我是个学生兵，
    艰苦锻炼最要紧。
    乙：张春玉同志说的好，
    我们要通过劳动来改造，
    改造思想变感情，
    这是革命化的好途径。
    甲：他还说，虽然我们吃点苦，
    一人辛苦万人福。
    为开伐林海建祖国，
    艰苦劳动最快乐！
    刨开硬地千层土，
