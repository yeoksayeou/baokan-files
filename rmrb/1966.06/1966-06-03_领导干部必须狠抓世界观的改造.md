    Southwest Regional Meeting of Activist Representatives of County-Level and Above Cadres in Studying Chairman Mao's Works Emphasizes:
    Leading Cadres Must Vigorously Grasp the Remolding of Their Worldview
    Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely struggle against all forms of bourgeois individualism centered on "self," firmly establish a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people, be loyal to the revolution, and remain revolutionary forever.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 2nd – The Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of activist representatives of county-level and above leading cadres in the Southwest region who are studying Chairman Mao's works, in Chengdu. The meeting focused on summarizing and exchanging experiences in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works by county-level and above leading cadres. Based on improved understanding, and addressing the current development of the study movement and existing problems, measures were studied to further strengthen leadership over the study movement.

      The meeting considered that all party members, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, must deeply recognize the great significance of giving prominence to politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards its demise and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. It is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most contemporary, vibrant Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guide for China's revolution and construction, but also a beacon guiding the world's people's revolution, and the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for fighting against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner of world revolution, a banner of victory, and a banner of glory. By following the path guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese revolution has continuously moved from victory to victory, and the cause of construction is becoming increasingly prosperous. By following the path guided by Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly be able to defeat U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, promote the victorious development of the world revolutionary movement.
    Currently, faced with the excellent situation at home and abroad, in order to promote the in-depth development of the world people's revolutionary struggle, so that socialism and communism can achieve complete victory throughout the world; in order to continuously and deeply advance the development of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, avoid the emergence of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, defeat U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, truly undertaking the glorious and arduous historical mission that China should shoulder for the world revolution, we must honestly and conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works is not a general question of reading or not reading, but a major issue of whether one can resolve to remold one’s thinking, eliminate distracting thoughts, strengthen Party spirit, accept the supervision of the Party organization and the masses, speak honestly, do honest things, be an honest person, truly act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a loyal and honest tool of the Party; it is a major issue of whether to serve the people wholeheartedly or half-heartedly; it is a major issue of whether to be a thorough revolutionary or a half-hearted revolutionary, a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary; it is a major issue of resolutely taking the socialist road or taking the revisionist and capitalist road.
    The situation reflected in the meeting shows that since the launch of the socialist education movement and the movement to learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and learn from Dazhai in the Southwest region in 1963, a new upsurge of widespread, mass-based study of Chairman Mao's works has emerged. The new era of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought has begun. This is an unprecedentedly major event in history, with extremely far-reaching significance. In the past year or two, county-level and above leading cadres have also made significant progress in studying Chairman Mao's works. The situation in which the study by leading cadres lags behind that of general cadres and the masses has begun to change, and a number of typical examples of better living study and application of Chairman Mao's works have emerged. The representatives of the First Branch of the First Transportation Company Directly Under the Ministry of Communications, the Jialing Machine Factory, the Baoshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province, the Huaning County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province, the Cangxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province, and the Renshou County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sichuan Province, as well as Wang Zhiguo, the secretary of the branch of the Guiyang Environmental Sanitation Management Station in Guizhou Province, Wu Xiangbi, the secretary of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guizhou Province, Basang, the deputy county head of Lang County in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Quedan, the deputy secretary of the Xietongmen County Committee of the Communist Party of China and county head of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and some PLA representatives invited to attend the meeting, are representatives who have studied well. Their experience shows that as long as the leadership team, especially the "squad leader," takes the lead in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and actively organizes cadres and the masses to study diligently, arms their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and regards Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work, they will be able to have a clear direction, a firm stand, and a clear understanding of right and wrong, and achieve remarkable results in the three great revolutionary movements.
    Judging from the situation reflected in the meeting, the development of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works in the Southwest region is still very uneven. The main problem is that the study by leading cadres at the county level and above is still very unsuited to the needs of the development of the situation. Although the situation in which the study by leading cadres lags behind that of workers, peasants, soldiers, and general cadres has changed somewhat, it has not fundamentally changed: those who truly study and apply in a living way are still in the minority, and although the majority of people have started studying, they do not study diligently enough, and the combination of study and application, theory and practice, is not good enough. The reasons for this include problems of understanding, problems of attitude, and also problems of method, and these problems are interrelated. For most comrades, the main problem is understanding. Only by first solving their problems of understanding can the movement to study Chairman Mao's works be carried out more extensively and deeply in the Southwest region.
    Li Dazhang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his speech at the meeting: "Whether leading cadres conscientiously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way is not only a matter of their own self-remolding and whether they can be competent for the leadership work they undertake, but also a major issue of guiding the cadres and masses in the areas, departments, and units they lead in what direction and leading them on what path. Grasping the study of leading cadres at the county level and above is the key to grasping the entire study movement. Therefore, the top leaders of Party committees at all levels above the county level, the main responsible comrades of all departments and units, and all leading cadres should set an example, take the lead in studying well, and take the lead in applying well, and must not delay or abandon their studies for any reason or excuse. They must personally grasp and specifically manage the study. Higher-level leaders should grasp the study of lower-level leadership teams, especially the study of the top leaders, level by level, leading level by level, helping level by level, and grasping it through to the end."
    In order to enhance cadres' understanding of the current situation and tasks and the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's works, overcome and correct various ideological obstacles in studying Chairman Mao's works, truly give prominence to politics, give prominence to Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, the meeting considered that Party committees, systems, and departments at all levels should arrange a certain amount of time in the near future to conduct a major discussion, in a well organized and led way, among the broad masses of cadres, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, on the issues of Mao Zedong Thought must command everything, and on the relationship between politics and professional work, politics and production, politics and technology, politics and culture, and politics and academics, resolutely oppose all forms of eclecticism. This major discussion must focus on positive education, first solving the problems of understanding of the leading core at all levels, and at the same time conduct a good self-education for the broad masses of cadres and the masses. In order to gradually carry out this major discussion in depth, it is necessary to earnestly study Chairman Mao's relevant works, promote democracy, open up minds, speak freely, adhere to presenting facts, reasoning things out, conducting criticism and self-criticism, raising awareness, and distinguishing between right and wrong. Through this major discussion, cadres, especially leading cadres, should truly realize that "politics is the commander, is the soul," "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," that giving prominence to politics is giving prominence to Mao Zedong Thought, truly achieve using Mao Zedong Thought as the commander in everything, everywhere, and at all times, truly regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all our work, put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work, not only take the lead in studying ourselves, but also grasp the work of cadres and the masses studying Chairman Mao's works tightly and well, and promote the ideological revolutionization of cadres and the masses.
    The meeting pointed out that whether or not to adhere to giving prominence to politics, to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought commanding everything, is a major matter of principle in the struggle between two ideologies and two lines, and a major sign distinguishing between strong Party spirit and impure Party spirit. This issue cannot be completely resolved by one major discussion alone. Therefore, after the major discussion, it is necessary to continuously struggle against various erroneous ideas that do not give prominence to politics, continuously raise the awareness of cadres and the masses, in order to ensure that we always give prominence to politics, and give prominence to politics forever.
    The meeting pointed out that the fundamental principle of studying Chairman Mao's works is to link theory with practice, study with problems in mind, and study and apply in a living way.
    The living study and application of Chairman Mao's works must be closely linked with the struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against all reactionaries; closely linked with the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment; closely linked with ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the glorious tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan; closely linked with the central work of various regions and departments; closely linked with the socialist education movement that is currently being carried out in depth in urban and rural areas; closely linked with the socialist cultural revolution, which is a matter of paramount importance to the fate and future of our Party and our country; closely linked with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the reform of systems, the revolutionization of grassroots organizations, the revolutionization of leading organs, the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization, and the gradual improvement of farmland capital construction; and vigorously grasp revolution, vigorously promote production, vigorously grasp revolution, and vigorously promote construction.
    The meeting considered that the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works is a great revolution to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. Therefore, it is necessary to work hard on the word "application," first of all applying it to the fundamental issue of remolding the bourgeois worldview and establishing the proletarian worldview, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres. Leading cadres at all levels must vigorously grasp the remolding of their own worldview, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely struggle against all forms of bourgeois individualism centered on "self," firmly establish a proletarian worldview of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people, be loyal to the revolution, and remain revolutionary forever. Studying Chairman Mao's works should adopt the method of rectification, dare to "put oneself in," "reveal" one's thoughts, and conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism. All leading cadres, especially members of the leading core at all levels above the county level, must place self-remolding under the supervision of the Party organization and the masses. Within a certain period of time, they should grasp one or two major ideological problems with general significance, adopt the method of combining self-examination with mobilizing the masses to offer opinions, of "broadening the channels of speech, opening the door for rectification," combine study with solving ideological problems, and combine concentrated attention to ideological problems with regular criticism and self-criticism. Leading cadres at the county level and above, in particular, must grasp giving prominence to politics, implementing the ideological revolutionization of people, firmly establishing the ideology of wholeheartedly and thoroughly serving the people, grasp class struggle, the struggle between two roads, grasp the implementation of democratic centralism, follow the mass line, grasp the mastery and application of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints on "practice first," "two leaps," and "one divides into two," as well as hard struggle, self-reliance, and the combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, and so on. They should study repeatedly, apply repeatedly, and constantly transform their subjective world in the struggle to transform the objective world, and promote ideological revolutionization. Only in this way can we do a good job in all revolutionary work and carry the proletarian revolution through to the end.
    The meeting considered that it is necessary to implement the spirit of "the leadership grasps, grasps the leadership," and effectively strengthen the leadership of the study movement.
    At present, cadres and the masses have a very high enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works. Party committees at all levels must grasp the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works by the broad masses of cadres, especially workers, peasants, and soldiers, and closely combine the study of leading cadres with the study of the masses, grasp the leadership and lead the masses; grasp the masses and promote the leadership. Party committees at all levels must truly put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work, closely combine work and study, and while arranging, inspecting, and summarizing work, first arrange, inspect, and summarize study. It is necessary to regularly study and solve the problems in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, organize forces to inspect and supervise, so as to promote the study movement to develop continuously and deeply forward.
    The meeting pointed out that the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas is currently being carried out in depth. The socialist cultural revolution, which has great historical significance, is sweeping away all monsters and demons with the force of a thunderbolt. In the socialist education movement and the Great Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way from beginning to end, directly use Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres, mobilize the masses, and raise the awareness of cadres and the masses; at the same time, organize grassroots cadres and activists to study Chairman Mao's works and quotations, gradually form a study system, establish study organizations, and drive the broad masses to study. Through the movement, develop study habits and lay a good foundation for grassroots cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works in the future, so that the study of Chairman Mao's works can be adhered to for a long time.
    The meeting considered that vigorously grasping models and vigorously establishing pacesetters is an important method of leading the study movement. Party committees at all levels should personally grasp the cultivation and improvement of advanced units and advanced individuals, so that the advanced banners of the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works can be established on all fronts more widely. Extensively publicize and promote their experiences in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, give full play to their backbone role and leading role, and promote the study movement to develop more widely, deeply, and solidly forward.
    More than 800 representatives of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Tibet Autonomous Region, Southwest Railway Construction Units, and organs directly under the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as representatives of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from the Kunming Military Region, Chengdu Military Region, and Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army who were invited to participate, attended the meeting.
    Responsible persons of the Party committees and relevant departments of the above-mentioned regions and units also attended the meeting.

    西南区县以上干部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会强调指出
    领导干部必须狠抓世界观的改造
    用毛泽东思想作武器，同形形色色的以“我”字为中心的资产阶级个人主义坚决斗争，牢固地树立完全、彻底为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，忠于革命，永远革命。
    新华社成都二日电　中共中央西南局最近在成都召开了西南地区县以上领导干部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会。会议着重总结交流了县以上领导干部活学活用毛主席著作的经验，并在提高认识的基础上，针对目前学习运动发展的情况和存在的问题，研究了进一步加强对学习运动的领导的措施。
      会议认为，所有党员干部，特别是县以上领导干部，必须深刻认识突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切的伟大意义。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想，是帝国主义走向灭亡和社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想不仅是中国革命和建设事业的指针，而且是指引世界人民革命的灯塔，是同帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派等一切牛鬼蛇神进行斗争的最强大最锋利的思想武器。毛泽东思想是世界革命的伟大旗帜，是胜利的旗帜，光荣的旗帜。遵循毛泽东思想指引的道路前进，中国革命就不断从胜利走向胜利，建设事业就日益兴旺。遵循毛泽东思想指引的道路前进，就一定能够战胜美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，促进世界革命运动的胜利发展。
    当前，面临着国际国内的大好形势，为了促进世界人民革命斗争的深入发展，使社会主义、共产主义在全世界取得彻底的胜利；为了不断地深入推进我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的发展，避免产生修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，战胜美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，更有力地支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，真正担负起中国对世界革命应当担负的光荣而艰巨的历史任务，我们必须老老实实地认真学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来。因此，学不学毛主席著作，不是一般的读不读书的问题，而是能否下定决心改造思想，清除杂念，加强党性锻炼，接受党组织和群众监督，说老实话，办老实事，做老实人，真正按照毛主席的指示办事，忠诚老实地做党的驯服工具的大问题；是全心全意为人民服务还是半心半意为人民服务的大问题；是彻底革命还是半截革命，是真革命还是假革命的大问题；是坚决走社会主义的道路，还是走修正主义、资本主义道路的大问题。
    会议反映的情况表明，西南地区从一九六三年开展社会主义教育运动和学习解放军、学大庆、学大寨以来，已经出现了一个广泛的、群众性的学习毛主席著作的新高潮。广大工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代开始了。这是历史上空前未有的一件大事，意义极为深远。县以上领导干部学习毛主席著作，近一两年也有显著的进步。领导干部学习落后于一般干部和群众的状况开始改变，已经涌现了一批活学活用毛主席著作比较好的典型。在这次会上发言的交通部直属第一运输总公司第一分公司、嘉陵机器厂、中共云南省保山地委、中共云南省华宁县委、中共四川省苍溪县委、中共四川省仁寿县委的代表，以及中共贵州省贵阳市环境卫生管理站支部书记王治国、中共贵州省松桃苗族自治县县委书记吴向必、西藏自治区朗县副县长巴桑、中共西藏自治区谢通门县县委副书记兼县长曲旦和一些应邀出席会议的解放军代表等，就是学得好的代表。他们的经验表明，只要领导班子，特别是“班长”首先带头活学活用毛主席著作，并且积极组织干部和群众认真学习，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，就能够方向明确，立场坚定，是非分明，在三大革命运动中，取得显著成绩。
    从会议反映的情况看来，目前西南地区学习毛主席著作运动发展还很不平衡，主要是县以上领导干部的学习，还很不适应形势发展的需要。县以上领导干部学习落后于工农兵群众和一般干部的状况，虽然已有所改变，但是还没有根本的改变：真正活学活用比较好的还是少数，多数人虽然学起来了，但学得不认真，学和用、理论和实际联系不够好。究其原因，有认识问题，有态度问题，也有方法问题，而这些问题又是相互联系的。就多数同志来说，主要是认识问题。只有首先解决好他们的认识问题，才能使西南地区学习毛主席著作运动更广泛、更深入地开展起来。
    中共中央西南局书记处书记李大章在会上讲话的时候指出：“领导干部是否认真活学活用毛主席著作，这不仅是关系到个人的自我改造和能否胜任所担负的领导工作的问题，而且是关系到要把自己所领导的地区、部门和单位的干部、群众引导到什么方向去，带领他们走什么样的道路的大问题。抓好县以上领导干部的学习，是抓好整个学习运动的关键。因此，县以上各级党委的第一把手，各部门、各单位的主要负责同志，和所有领导干部，都应当以身作则，带头学好，带头用好，不能以任何理由和借口拖延或荒废学习。对学习一定要亲自抓，具体管。上级领导要抓下级领导班子的学习，特别是要抓第一把手的学习，一级抓一级，一级带一级，一级帮一级，一抓到底。”
    为了提高干部对当前形势任务和学习毛主席著作的伟大意义的认识，克服和纠正学习毛主席著作中的种种思想障碍，真正突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。会议认为，当前各级党委、各系统、各部门，都应该安排一定时间，在广大干部中，首先是县以上领导干部中，就毛泽东思想必须统帅一切，就政治和业务、政治和生产、政治和技术、政治和文化、政治和学术的关系等问题，有组织有领导地开展一场大讨论，坚决反对各种形式的折衷主义。这场大讨论，必须以正面教育为主，首先是解决好各级领导核心的认识问题，同时对广大干部和群众很好地进行一次自我教育。为了把这场大讨论逐步深入地开展起来，一定要认真学习毛主席的有关著作，发扬民主，敞开思想，畅所欲言，坚持摆事实，讲道理，开展批评和自我批评，提高觉悟，分清是非。通过这场大讨论，使干部首先是领导干部真正认识到“政治是统帅，是灵魂”，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想，真正做到事事、处处、时时用毛泽东思想挂帅，真正把毛主席的书作为我们一切工作的最高指示，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，不仅自己带头学，而且把广大干部和群众学习毛主席著作的工作抓紧抓好，促进干部和群众的思想革命化。
    会议指出，是否坚持突出政治，坚持毛泽东思想统帅一切，是两种思想、两条路线斗争的重大原则性问题，是区分党性坚强或者是党性不纯的主要标志。这个问题，决不是一次大讨论就能够完全解决的。因此，经过大讨论后，还要不断地同不突出政治的种种错误思想反复进行斗争，不断地提高干部和群众的觉悟，才能保证经常突出政治，永远突出政治。
    会议指出，学习毛主席著作的根本原则是理论联系实际，带着问题学，活学活用。
    活学活用毛主席著作，必须同反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争紧密结合起来；同阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动紧密结合起来；同保证完成和超额完成第三个五年计划的光荣任务紧密结合起来；同各地区、各部门的中心工作紧密结合起来；同当前正在深入开展的城乡社会主义教育运动紧密结合起来；同关系到我们党和国家命运、前途的头等大事社会主义文化革命紧密结合起来；同发展工农业生产、体制改革、基层组织革命化、领导机关革命化、逐步实现农业机械化、逐步搞好农田基本建设等工作紧密结合起来；大抓革命，大促生产，大抓革命，大促建设。
    会议认为，活学活用毛主席著作，是一场兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的大革命，因此，必须在“用”字上狠下功夫，首先用在改造资产阶级世界观、树立无产阶级世界观这个根本问题上，促进干部的思想革命化。各级领导干部必须狠抓自己世界观的改造，用毛泽东思想作武器，同形形色色的以“我”字为中心的资产阶级个人主义坚决斗争，牢固地树立完全、彻底为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，忠于革命，永远革命。学习毛主席著作，应采用整风的方法，敢于把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，认真开展批评与自我批评。所有领导干部，特别是县以上各级领导核心成员，一定要把自我改造放在党组织和群众的监督之下，在一定时期内，抓住一、两个带有普遍性的主要思想问题，采取自己检查与发动群众提意见相结合的“广开言路，开门整风”的方法，把学习和解决思想问题结合起来，把集中抓思想问题和经常开展批评与自我批评结合起来。县以上领导干部，特别要抓突出政治，落实人的思想革命化，牢固地树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，抓阶级斗争、两条道路斗争，抓贯彻执行民主集中制，走群众路线，抓掌握与运用毛主席关于“实践第一”、“两个飞跃”、“一分为二”的根本观点，以及艰苦奋斗、自力更生、革命精神与科学态度相结合等等问题，反复学，反复用，在改造客观世界的斗争中不断改造自己的主观世界，促进思想革命化。只有这样，才能把一切革命工作搞好，把无产阶级革命进行到底。
    会议认为，必须贯彻“领导抓，抓领导”的精神，切实加强对学习运动的领导。
    目前，干部和群众学习毛主席著作热情很高，各级党委一定要把广大干部、特别是工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作抓紧抓好，把领导干部的学习和群众的学习密切地结合起来，抓领导，带群众；抓群众，促领导。各级党委，必须真正做到把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，把工作和学习紧密结合起来，在布置、检查、总结工作的同时，首先布置、检查、总结学习。要定期研究和解决学习毛主席著作运动中的问题，组织力量，检查督促，以推动学习运动不断深入地向前发展。
    会议指出，目前城乡社会主义教育运动正在深入进行。具有伟大历史意义的社会主义文化革命，正以雷霆万钧之力横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。在社会主义教育运动和文化大革命中，必须自始至终活学活用毛主席著作，直接用毛泽东思想去教育干部、发动群众，提高干部和群众的觉悟；同时组织基层干部和积极分子，学习毛主席著作和语录，逐步形成学习制度，建立学习组织，并带动广大群众学习。通过运动养成学习习惯，为今后基层干部和群众学习毛主席著作打下良好的基础，使学习毛主席著作长期坚持下去。
    会议认为，大抓样板，大树标兵，是领导学习运动的一个重要方法。各级党委应当亲自抓好对先进单位和先进人物的培养提高工作，使活学活用毛主席著作的先进旗帜，在各条战线上更多地树立起来。广泛宣传和推广他们活学活用毛主席著作的经验，充分发挥他们的骨干作用和带头作用，促使学习运动更广泛地、深入地、扎实地向前发展。
    出席这次会议的，有四川、云南、贵州、西藏自治区、西南铁路建设单位和中共中央西南局直属机关学习毛主席著作积极分子的代表、以及应邀参加的解放军昆明部队、成都部队、西藏部队学习毛主席著作积极分子的代表，共八百多人。
    参加会议的，还有上述各地区、各单位的党委负责人和有关部门的负责人。
