    Using the Spirit of the Foolish Old Man to Conquer Natural Disasters
    Broad Masses of Commune Members on the Huaibei Plain Happily Harvest Wheat
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 31st – The broad masses of commune members on the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province are reaping wheat with great joy. This year, more than 20 million mu of wheat in the Fuyang and Su County areas of the Huaibei region are growing very well. Currently, one-third of the wheat has been harvested in various places.
    The early-maturing wheat, Early Foreign, Anhui No. 3, Abe, and Afu, and other improved varieties of wheat, which were expanded and planted by the Huaibei rural areas in accordance with local conditions, have large ears, many grains, and full kernels. Although some wheat in the Fuyang area was affected by rust and insect pests, the broad masses of commune members, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, were in high spirits and vigorously fought the disaster, and the wheat is still growing well.
    Last year's characteristics of wheat sowing in Huaibei were many improved varieties, much fertilizer, and reasonable close planting. Since last autumn, the broad masses of cadres and commune members have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, given prominence to politics, and used the spirit of the Foolish Old Man to change the face of the disaster area in Huaibei. Last winter and this spring, more than 2 million mu of terrace fields were dug in various places in Su County. This spring, Huaibei had heavy rain, and some wheat fields were flooded. Commune members rose up to drain the water, saving more than 800,000 mu of wheat from flooding. Winter and spring saw a general strengthening of field management of wheat in various places. The Su County area alone had 3.5 million mu of topdressing area. In terms of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, many areas adopted methods such as spraying medicines and manual capture, with men, women, old, and young working together to quickly eliminate armyworms, and great achievements were also made in preventing wheat rust.
    In order to welcome the busy summer harvest, the Fuyang area summarized past experiences and lessons, used the "one divides into two" viewpoint to educate cadres and commune members, overcome blind optimism and complacency, and made early arrangements for labor and animal power, added agricultural tools, leveled sites, and repaired warehouses. Many areas have also planned for both sunny and rainy days from the worst-case scenario, determined to do a good job in the summer harvest with high standards and high quality, carefully harvesting and storing to strive to prevent the harvested grain from being damaged. Before the start of the harvest, various places also mobilized the masses to carry out seed selection and retention activities, seizing the opportunity to remove impurities and inferior varieties in the fields, and selecting high-yielding, disease-resistant improved wheat varieties for autumn sowing this year.

    用愚公移山精神战胜自然灾害
    淮北平原广大社员喜割小麦
    新华社合肥三十一日电　安徽省淮北平原上的广大社员怀着极大的喜悦开镰割麦。今年淮北地区阜阳、宿县两专区的二千多万亩小麦长势很好。目前，各地已收割小麦三分之一。
    淮北农村因地制宜扩种的早茬麦、早洋、安徽三号、阿勃、阿夫等良种小麦，长得穗大粒多，籽粒饱满。阜阳地区的一些小麦虽然害了锈病，遭受了虫害，但广大社员在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下意气风发，大力抗灾，小麦的长势仍然较好。
    去年淮北小麦播种的特点是良种多，肥料多，密植合理。去秋以来，广大干部、社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，用愚公移山的精神改变淮北灾区的面貌。去冬今春，宿县专区各地挖了二百多万亩台田。今春淮北下了大雨，一些麦田渍了水，社员们奋起排水，使八十多万亩小麦免受水灾。冬春各地普遍加强了小麦田间管理。宿县专区追肥面积就有三百五十万亩。在防治病虫害方面，很多地区采取喷撒药剂、人工捕捉等办法，男女老少一齐动手，迅速扑灭了粘虫，防治麦锈病也取得很大成绩。
    为了迎接夏收大忙，阜阳专区总结往年经验教训，用一分为二的观点教育干部社员，克服盲目乐观和麻痹思想，及早做好劳畜力安排，添置农具、平整场地，缮修仓库。许多地区还从最坏处设想，做好了晴雨两套打算，决心以高标准高质量做好夏收工作，精打细收，力争不让到手的粮食受损失。在开始收割之前，各地还发动群众开展选种留种活动，抓紧时机在田间去杂去劣，穗选片选高产、抗病的小麦良种，为今年秋种留足良种。
