	Three Words and Two Phrases
	Stupid Imitation
	United Press International reported that the U.S. 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam had decided to establish "sniper teams," supposedly "copied from the Viet Cong guerrilla warfare textbook." Furthermore, the division's spokesman said: "If it works for the Viet Cong, it should work for us too."
	After suffering greatly from the South Vietnamese people's guerrilla warfare, the U.S. aggressors are fantasizing about copying some strategies and tactics from the South Vietnamese people's armed forces to deal with the South Vietnamese people. But this cannot save them from failure. In the past, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries also tried to learn the strategies and tactics of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to deal with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but it was completely ineffective. This is because the strategies and tactics of the revolutionary people are based on the foundation of people's war, and any anti-people army cannot utilize these strategies and tactics. The U.S. military in Vietnam thinks it's very clever to establish so-called "sniper teams," but it is actually extremely stupid.
	A Losing Gamble
	American bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann admitted that the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam has no hope of success. He said, "We are not winning, and we don't see that we will win," but Johnson "has an instinctive aversion to failure." Therefore, he believes that Johnson "is taking a reckless gamble."
	Knowing full well that he will lose, he still wants to gamble. It is more appropriate to say that this is "a gamble to lose everything" rather than "a reckless gamble."

    三言两语
    愚蠢的抄袭
    合众国际社报道，侵越美军第二十五步兵师决定要成立“狙击小组”，据说这是“从越共游击战术教科书上抄袭来的”。而且这个师的发言人还说：“如果这对越共有效对我们也应当有效”。
    美国侵略军在吃足南越人民游击战争苦头以后，异想天开地企图从南越人民武装那里抄袭一些战略战术来对付南越人民，但这是挽救不了他们的失败的。过去，美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派也曾经想学习中国人民解放军的战略战术，用来对付中国人民解放军，结果是完全不济事。这是因为革命人民的战略战术是建立在人民战争这个基础上的，任何反人民的军队都不能利用这些战略战术。侵越美军成立所谓“狙击小组”，自以为聪明得很，其实是愚蠢之至。
    输光的赌博
    美国资产阶级评论员李普曼承认，美国侵越战争是没有成功希望的。他说
  “我们并没有打胜仗，也看不到会胜利”，可是约翰逊“对不成功有本能的反感”。因此，他认为约翰逊“是在进行一场不顾一切的赌博”。
    明知必输，还是要赌。与其说这是“不顾一切的赌博”，不如说是输光“一切的赌博”更加合适。
