    Each Drop of Spring Water Reflects Class Sentiment
　　Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Fei Boqing
    One morning, a new soldier had just taken a porcelain bowl of water from the trough in front of the dormitory to rinse his mouth when he was immediately stopped by an old comrade. After the old comrade pointed it out, the new soldier immediately realized his mistake and happily ran to the mountain more than a mile away to fetch water.
    Why not use the water in front of the door, but run to the mountain to fetch water?
    This April, the Third Company of a certain unit came to this mountain to perform a mission. When they arrived at their destination, the soldiers saw the spring water flowing from the mountain to the front of the door and thought: It's so convenient to use water here!
    But the next day, a strange thing puzzled the soldiers. The worker guarding the fruit trees on this mountain didn't use the water in the trough in front of the door, but ran to the spring on the mountain to carry water back to irrigate the fruit trees. What was going on?
    It wasn't until the fourth day that the instructor revealed the mystery. The instructor led all the comrades of the company from the mountainside where the troops were stationed to the foot of the mountain, and then from the end of the trough at the foot of the mountain to the source of the spring—two springs on the mountain. It turned out that the spring water flowing down from the mountain was not only used to irrigate more than 10,000 fruit trees on the mountain, but also to supply domestic water to more than a dozen commune members' families at the foot of the mountain. The workers were very happy to see the People's Liberation Army arrive. They thought: If all the water in the trough is used to irrigate the fruit trees, the People's Liberation Army would have to carry water up the mountain to use it. So, they decided to let the People's Liberation Army use the water in the trough, and they would carry water up the mountain to irrigate the fruit trees, even if it was a little hard, they were happy to do it. The commune members living at the foot of the mountain saw the workers doing this and silently went around from the foot of the mountain to the spring on the mountain to carry water back for their own use.
    The people's concern deeply moved the soldiers. Originally, there was a lot of water in the spring, but because it hadn't been repaired for a long time, one of the two springs was almost blocked by rubble. Because the water in the spring flowed slowly, the water flowing down still couldn't fully meet the needs of the workers for irrigating the fruit trees and the commune members' families for domestic water.
    The instructor saw these situations, thought about them in his heart, and then asked everyone: "The people care about us so much, what should we do?" The soldiers all said unanimously: We can't let the workers and commune members carry water up the mountain, we will carry water up the mountain for our own use." "Right!" The instructor said with satisfaction: "In order to let the fruit trees bear abundant fruit, and in order to fully meet the domestic water needs of the commune members' families, we not only can't use the water in the trough in front of the door, but also repair the spring, so that the spring water flows faster and more." The instructor's words were unanimously approved by all the comrades in the company. No sooner said than done, the next day, the soldiers used their rest time to dredge the spring and build the four walls of the spring firmly, quickly increasing the flow of the spring water.
    Although the spring was repaired, the water flowing to the foot of the mountain was still not enough because the pipe of the trough was small. Therefore, the soldiers still carried water up the mountain every day for their own use. This made the workers and commune members very anxious. They found the instructor and said that they couldn't let the soldiers carry water up the mountain. The instructor said: "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, we are the people's soldiers, and maintaining the interests of the people is the people's soldiers' bounden duty. We accept your kindness to the People's Liberation Army, but we can't use the water in the trough in front of the door!" Seeing that the instructor was so firm, the workers and commune members knew that it would be useless to say more. After discussing it, they came up with a way to mobilize several young men every day to quietly carry water to the front of the People's Liberation Army dormitory when the People's Liberation Army was sleeping at night. Unexpectedly, the first day they did this, they were discovered by the instructor during the night roll call. As a result, it was very lively. The workers said: "The People's Liberation Army works hard all day long, it's nothing for us to carry water up the mountain!" The commune members also said: "It's perfectly right for us to carry water up the mountain for our own army!" But the soldiers said: "Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In order to ensure that the masses have enough water, we can't use the water in the trough in front of the door." After arguing back and forth, in the end, the workers and commune members still couldn't beat these soldiers who loved the people.
    The clear spring water flows quietly, from the mountain to the foot of the mountain, to the orchard, and to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants. This drop by drop of spring water is the crystallization of the deep class feelings between the army and the people. In order to express their feelings for the People's Liberation Army, the workers and commune members gathered together with the People's Liberation Army to hold an army-people get-together. Truly, each drop of clear spring water embodies deep class sentiment!

    滴滴泉水阶级情
　　解放军某部战士　费伯清
    清晨，一个新战士刚从宿舍门前的水槽里打起一瓷碗漱口水，马上就被一个老同志制止住。经老同志一点，新战士立刻意识到自己错了，连忙高兴地跑到距宿舍一里多路的山上去打水。
    门前有水不用，为什么要跑到山上去打水呢？
    今年四月，某部三连来这山里执行任务，到达目的地，战士们看到从山上流到门前的泉水，心想：这里用水可方便啦！
    可是第二天，一件奇怪的事却使战士们想不通。住在这山上看守果树的工人不用门前水槽里的水，却跑到山上泉眼里担水回来浇灌果树，这是怎么回事呢？
    直到第四天，才被指导员揭开了这个谜。指导员带着全连同志从部队住的山腰上走到山脚下，又从山脚下水槽的终点找到泉水的发源地——山上两口泉眼。原来这些从山上流下来的泉水不仅要用来浇灌山上一万多棵果树，而且还要供应山脚下十多户社员的家庭用水。工人见解放军来了，打心眼里高兴。他们想：如果水槽里的水都用来浇灌果树，解放军就非要上山担水用不可。于是，他们决定把水槽里的水让给解放军用，自己上山担水浇灌果树，就是辛苦一点，也是高兴的。前面有车，后面有辙，住在山脚下的社员看到工人这样作，也不声不响地从山脚下绕到山上的泉眼里担水回来用。
    人民的关心，使战士们深受感动。本来，泉眼里的水不少，只是长期未修，两口泉眼有一口快被乱石淤塞了。由于泉眼里的水流的慢，所以，流下去的水还不能充分满足工人浇灌果树和社员家庭用水的需要。
    指导员把这些情况看在眼里，想在心里，接着问大家：“人民这样关心我们，我们应该怎么办？”战士们都一致表示：我们不能让工人和社员到山上担水，我们要用水自己上山去担。“对！”指导员满意地说：“为了让果树结出丰硕的果实，为了充分满足社员家庭用水的需要，我们不仅不能用门前水槽里的水，还要把泉眼修好，让泉水流得更快更多。”指导员的话得到全连同志的一致赞同。说干就干，第二天，战士们便利用休息时间疏通泉眼，把泉眼的四壁垒得结结实实，很快加大了泉水的流量。
    泉眼虽然修好了，但由于水槽的管子小，流到山下的水仍然不多，因此，战士们照旧天天上山担水用。这下可把工人和社员急坏了，他们找到指导员，说什么也不能让战士们上山担水，指导员却说：“我们是毛主席的战士，我们是人民的子弟兵，维护人民的利益是子弟兵义不容辞的责任，我们收下你们对解放军的心意，但是，这门前水槽里的水我们不能用！”工人和社员们见指导员这么坚决，知道再多说也是枉然。他们经过商量，想出了一个办法，每天发动几个小伙子，趁解放军晚上睡觉的时候，悄悄地把水担到解放军宿舍的门前。不料，这样做的第一天，就被指导员晚上查铺时发觉了。结果，可热闹啦，工人说：“解放军整天很辛苦，我们上山担水，算不了什么！”社员也说：“我们上山给自己的军队担水，完全应该！”战士们却说：“毛主席教导我们，要全心全意地为人民服务。我们要按照毛主席的指示办事，为了群众有充分的用水，我们不能用门前水槽里的水。”争论来争论去，最后，工人和社员还是拗不过这些热爱人民的战士。
    清清的泉水静静地流着，从山上流到山下，流向果园里，流到贫下中农的家里。这一滴一滴的泉水啊，是军民之间深厚的阶级感情的结晶。工人和社员为了表达对解放军的一片心意，和解放军欢聚一堂，召开了一个军民联欢晚会。真是滴滴清泉水，深深阶级情！
