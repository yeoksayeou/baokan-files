    More Than a Million Jin of Fish Caught in Xin'an River Reservoir
    The fishing season for bighead carp and silver carp spawning in the Xin'an River Reservoir in Zhejiang Province has yielded a good harvest. From April 23rd to May 14th, more than 1.5 million jin of bighead carp and silver carp have been caught, exceeding the first half-year production plan by 20% and completing it ahead of schedule.
    The farm-raised fish stocked in the Xin'an River Reservoir grow rapidly and are abundant. On April 27th, 430,000 jin of fish were caught, setting a new record for the highest daily output in history. The average weight of the silver carp caught was 22 jin per fish, and the bighead carp weighed 65 jin, most of which were four-year-old fish.
                                                                                                                                (According to Xinhua News Agency)
