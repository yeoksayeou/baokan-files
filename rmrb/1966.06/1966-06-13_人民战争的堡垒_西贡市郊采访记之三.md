    People's War Fortress
    Interviews from the Suburbs of Saigon, Part Three
    Revolutionary People Have Many Ways
    When the small liberated areas in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region of South Vietnam were first established, the US-puppet clique sent troops to "sweep" every two or three days. In 1963, McNamara personally formulated a plan to make the Saigon-Gia Dinh region a key area for "sweeps," deploying entire regiments and divisions of puppet troops to be stationed in the villages, continuously conducting "sweeps" for ten days to half a month. Starting this year, the US aggressor troops have carried out even larger-scale "sweeps" in the suburbs of Saigon, each time mobilizing thousands or nearly ten thousand troops. American planes dropped tons upon tons of bombs, and the artillery in the strongholds bombarded indiscriminately all night long. The US aggressors attempted to use inhumane "sweeps" and indiscriminate bombings to force the South Vietnamese people to submit and reoccupy the liberated areas.
    The US imperialism has been doing this for several years, and what has been the result? The liberated areas in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region have persevered under difficult conditions, and the liberated areas have gradually grown from small to large. The local people have become stronger through tenacious struggle. The people of Run De commune in Cu Chi district said, "No matter how fierce and evil US imperialism is, we are not afraid. We revolutionary people have many ways to defeat it." The armed combat village, this new creation of the masses in the struggle, is precisely a good way to exert the power of people's war, defeat the enemy, and defend the liberated areas.
    D commune is only twenty kilometers or so from Saigon, consisting of five natural villages with over two hundred households. The commune is surrounded by several US-puppet military strongholds, the closest being three or four kilometers away and the farthest seven or eight kilometers. That year, the people of D commune rose up, destroyed the "strategic hamlets," and liberated the entire commune. Initially, when the US-puppet troops came to "sweep," the masses would all hide, and each "sweep" would bring disaster to the whole commune. With the US-puppet troops coming so frequently, the people's production and lives were affected.
    Facts educated the people: hiding was not the solution. They said, "Villages linked to villages, communes linked to communes, we must arm ourselves, organize ourselves, and persist in fighting on the spot."
    People demonstrated a high degree of creativity in the struggle. D commune established combat villages, and combat villages were born, grew, and strengthened in the struggle.
    Today, the D commune combat village is a true fortress of people's war. The entire village is fortified very tightly. As we walked along the wide sandy land, we saw intricate crisscrossing trenches, one person deep, connecting the villages. In one village, we saw bamboo pole frameworks erected on the roads, beside the paths, and in the grass; these were markers for setting traps. As soon as the battle alarm sounded, people would systematically remove these frameworks. Staked traps were arranged very cleverly, some rectangular and some round. The traps were dug very deep, with dozens of sharp bamboo spikes pointing straight up, so that anyone falling in would most likely be killed. There were so many traps here, arranged so cleverly, that it was impossible for the enemy to enter the village without falling into them. Once, when the US-puppet troops came to the village to "sweep," they brought modern mine detectors, but they were of no use at all. Six puppet soldiers and one US "advisor" successively fell into the traps and lost their lives. The outer perimeter of the village had fortifications such as barbed wire, fences, stakes, and minefields, and the village entrances and inside were dug with many individual foxholes and hidden bunkers. On the way to the outside of the village, the guerrilla captain put his gun on the ground and pointed to the side of our feet, saying, "There's a tunnel entrance here, look for it." We bent down and looked carefully for a long time, but failed. The guerrilla captain smiled, stepped forward, and brushed the ground twice with his hand, and a tunnel entrance was revealed before our eyes. If you go down this entrance for a while, it's practically an underground Great Wall.
    "Have the enemies ever discovered a tunnel entrance?" we asked.
    "Never."
    "Even if they discovered it, it wouldn't be useful," a guerrilla member interjected. To prove his point, he immediately told a story. Once, the US-puppet troops found a tunnel entrance in a neighboring village and were overjoyed, but no one dared to go down. They immediately used a helicopter to transport a water pump from Saigon to pump water into the tunnel. The tunnel was like a reservoir, with tons upon tons of water pumped in, but there was not a single sign of movement. The US-puppet troops then brought explosives to blow it up. They kept at it until sunset, without finding even a shadow of the guerrilla team. They had no choice but to leave dejectedly.
    Of course, relying solely on the tight fortifications of the combat village was not enough. If the people could not be fully mobilized and determined to fight, then the combat village could not exert the power of a fighting fortress. In this regard, the people of the liberated areas in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region have accumulated rich experience in the long struggle. The local people say: "Mobilizing the masses, organizing them, destroying 'strategic hamlets' with leadership, smashing the grassroots puppet regime, eliminating thugs, establishing mass organizations, establishing self-governing power, and establishing guerrilla teams are the basic points for launching combat village guerrilla warfare in the plains, and establishing a strong guerrilla force is the key."
      Experience is Gained Through Fighting
    The great power of the combat village lies in the guerrilla teams' ability to utilize their familiarity with the terrain and battle defenses of the combat village to annihilate invading enemies with the support of the people.
    The D commune combat village has a strong guerrilla team. The guerrilla members are all young men and women from the commune. They seized weapons from the enemy and armed themselves. In the beginning, the guerrilla team had no combat experience. Initially, things like this happened: when the US-puppet troops came to "sweep," the guerrilla team would rush up and start firing their guns everywhere without waiting for the enemy to get close. When the enemy launched a frenzied counterattack, the guerrilla team had almost run out of bullets, could not hold out, and had to retreat. This incident taught the guerrilla team a lesson: to win battles, they must summarize and create their own experiences.
    Later, when the guerrilla team fought, they divided into mobile and flexible combat groups. Some laid mines, some ambushed, and some turned around to the enemy's rear to launch surprise attacks and clever battles. Once, when a US "advisor" led a group of puppet troops into the village, the guerrilla team did not attack at first, but let the enemy in, and waited until the enemy entered the trap zone. Then, the guerrilla team fired guns from all directions. The US-puppet troops, upon hearing the gunfire, hurriedly scattered and ran in all directions, falling into the traps one after another. The US "advisor" also fell into a trap. The puppet troops were panic-stricken and dared not move forward any further. They dragged the US "advisor" out of the trap and fled back for their lives.
  The enemy suffered losses several times when invading the D commune combat village and dared not enter the village on foot. They changed to using M-113 amphibious armored vehicles to enter the village for "sweeps." The guerrilla team called this armored vehicle the "dung beetle." It had a metal shell all around, and the US-puppet troops could hide inside, not afraid of traps or the guerrilla team's cold shots. The US aggressors boasted that the M-113 armored vehicle was the best weapon for attacking the guerrillas. When they first appeared in the suburbs of Saigon, they deliberately avoided the flat roads and only chose bad roads to travel on. They would smash into small trees, knocking down the trunks to show their power and scare the people.
    This time, the US-puppet troops came to D commune combat village to "sweep," riding in sixteen M-113 armored vehicles. The people of D commune combat village had made battle preparations before the enemy came to "sweep." Guerrilla captain Nguyen Van Co gathered the guerrilla members and the masses together and said: "We have no experience in fighting 'dung beetles.' What do you all say, should we fight them or not?" The guerrilla members and the masses said, "Why shouldn't we fight them!" "Can we not fight them?" "Who has experience, experience is gained through fighting." The masses and guerrilla members clamored, each saying something. Guerrilla captain, seeing that everyone's fighting spirit was high, said happily: "Good, we must fight them. Let's think about how to fight them." That day, the guerrilla team and the masses prepared for battle together. They carried homemade "105 landmines" and buried them at the road crossings. The masses planted bamboo spikes and set traps. The guerrilla members bounded into the ambush fortifications. The guerrilla captain lay at the head, his round eyes beneath thick eyebrows staring straight at the road leading into the village. Seeing an M-113 armored vehicle approaching from afar, it suddenly stopped as it approached the landmine. "Damn!" The guerrilla captain was sweating anxiously, thinking, "Has the landmine been discovered?" At this time, the machine gun on the armored vehicle started firing "tat-tat" densely, and the bullets drilled into the trees, knocking down the leaves. The guerrilla captain, listening to the enemy's gunfire, immediately made the correct judgment that the enemy was trying to test the guerrilla team's firepower and had stopped advancing. He slightly raised his head and gave the guerrilla members behind him a wink, telling them to be calm. The M-113 armored vehicle fired a burst of machine-gun fire, and seeing no movement, it moved forward again. "Pull!" With the guerrilla captain's command, there was a loud "boom," and the M-113 armored vehicle was surrounded by rolling smoke. The vehicle's treads were broken with a "swish." Taking advantage of the smoke, the guerrilla captain picked up a grenade, jumped out of the fortifications, and dashed like the wind to the overturned armored vehicle. He could only hear the enemies inside the vehicle wailing, crying, and howling. The guerrilla captain was quick-witted and quick-handed, pulled the grenade's ignition line, and threw it into the vehicle window. The grenades exploded continuously, and there was no more sound in the vehicle. Then, several more M-113 armored vehicles rumbled over, but none dared to cross the destroyed vehicle. They blindly fired their guns around in all directions while throwing out ropes to drag the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle away. This was the first time that the Saigon suburb guerrilla team had used landmines to destroy a US military M-113 armored vehicle. This victory once again proved that it is the people who determine the outcome of the war, not any new weapons. This victory greatly encouraged the local people's will to fight.
    With the strong cooperation of the masses, the D commune combat village guerrilla team became stronger and stronger as they fought. In 1964, this guerrilla team fought seventy-two battles. Once, they fought a battalion of enemies for thirteen days. The guerrilla team was flexible and mobile, fighting from outside the village to inside the village, fighting during the day and fighting at night, killing 135 enemies in a row, while only one guerrilla member was injured.
    "Last year," the guerrilla captain told us, "our guerrilla team fought fifty-six battles. But none of them were fought in our own village."
    "Does that mean that the enemy doesn't dare to enter the village at all?" we asked.
    "That's right, the enemy doesn't dare to come, so our guerrilla team can only fight outside. Now, we cooperate with the local armed forces and go to the highways and near the enemy's strongholds to fight. Wouldn't you say that's a change?" The guerrilla captain said meaningfully.
    Airplanes and Armored Vehicles Cannot Enter Underground Tunnels
    The establishment, consolidation, and expansion of the liberated areas in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region have not been smooth sailing either. The liberated areas here have experienced a complex and tortuous struggle process of expansion, shrinking, and re-expansion. The people's forces have tempered and strengthened themselves in the tenacious struggle, have developed a high degree of revolutionary spirit and creativity, have withstood the test, and have defeated the enemy. During our visit here, we saw everywhere the fearless spirit of revolutionary heroism of the people and vivid examples of creative struggle.
    The folks in the combat village are all fighters. As soon as the battle sounds, men, women, old, and young all stand firmly at their fighting posts. They fight the enemy together with the guerrilla team in the smoke and flames of war. They join hands with the enemy to carry out face-to-face political struggle. In the years of battle, they have developed an unparalleled heroic revolutionary spirit and have cultivated an orderly combat life. However, whenever we express our admiration to them, they always modestly say to us: "It's nothing, we've long been accustomed to the tense battle life."
    Indeed, the people in the liberated areas in the suburbs of Saigon have become accustomed to the intense battle life. Now, the US-puppet troops dare not easily invade the liberated areas from the ground. They have switched to using airplanes to bomb and artillery to bombard, carrying out so-called "scorched earth" bombings of the liberated areas. Just one or two kilometers from Saigon, the US aggressors have used B-52 strategic bombers for continuous indiscriminate bombing. As soon as it gets dark, 105mm, 155mm, and 203mm artillery pieces bombard the liberated areas indiscriminately all night long. However, the enemy's frenzied bombing and shelling do not scare even children over ten years old.
    When enemy planes attack, the guerrilla team of the combat village quickly enters the anti-aircraft firing position, and they shoot at the diving American aircraft with rifles. Despite the flying shrapnel, the guerrilla team's anti-aircraft position stands firm. The guerrilla team of D commune combat village has shot down American helicopters with rifles. Although the masses cannot shoot planes like the guerrilla team, they have created an effective way to fight enemy plane bombing. The local people almost all know how to deal with F-105 fighter-bombers and how to deal with B-52 strategic bombers. People use the method of digging very deep and hidden air-raid shelters and trenches to withstand the barbarous bombing of the American aircraft.
    In the combat village, in addition to a few bed boards and simple tables and chairs, there are few other things in the house of each family. People disperse and bury useful things. Food is placed in secret grain storage caves. Bed mats, boxes, and bedding are placed scattered in the trees. Each household digs a very deep basement in the house, which is surrounded by a thick layer of soil, or piles of large stones. The room is very clean, with snow-white mosquito nets hanging on the beds, and slogans such as "Resolutely defeat the American imperialist aggressors" are posted on the walls. When the enemy bombards, the local people go into the basement to sleep. Over the years, countless shells have fallen in D commune combat village, but not a single person in the village has been killed by shells. Not only that, but even the farm cattle have sturdy and hidden defense caves.
    How do the people in the combat village persist in field production amidst the flying shells? We walked around the village and did not see a single piece of wasteland. The rice seedlings in the fields are growing very well. On the dry land around the village and in front and behind the houses, large-leaf vegetables, water spinach, and plants called "ginseng" by the locals are growing green. The villagers told us that before liberation, many poor and tenant farmers often lacked food all year round. Now that they have been allocated land and have organized five production mutual aid teams, no household in the entire village lacks food. The peasants have turned over politically, and their enthusiasm for fighting and production is high. They carry guns in one hand and plow in the other, persisting in fighting and producing in the same place. They have dug defense works on almost every piece of farmland. When people go to work in the fields, the guerrilla team carries guns and patrols back and forth. Even if enemy planes appear, it doesn't matter. People are good at judging the course of the planes and the point of impact of the bombs. Enemy planes fly low, and people are very calm. Only when the bombs fall in their direction do they quickly jump into the caves by the side of the fields. People say: "American planes will never be able to bomb every piece of land. We have figured out their patterns, and we can defeat them and continue to work and produce."
    The US-puppet clique has always tried to pull out the banner of the liberated areas in the suburbs of Saigon, but they have always been unable to succeed. Each combat village in the liberated area is an independent combat unit. The combat villages cooperate and support each other to form an organic and complete combat system, containing and attacking the enemy, and plunging the enemy into the vast ocean of people's war.
    D commune combat village is one of the many combat villages in the suburbs of Saigon and a microcosm of the hundreds of thousands of combat villages in the liberated areas of South Vietnam. This combat village can be said to be right under the enemy's nose, but this banner has been flying in the wind for many years.
    What power supports the local people's tenacious will to fight? In the center of the combat village, we saw a hatred monument erected. On the front of the hatred monument are written the names of 125 martyred heroes. Every peasant family in the combat village has suffered persecution. Class hatred and national hatred are burning in everyone's heart as a fire of struggle. In the face of the revolutionary people, in the face of the people who have organized a tight combat system, all the threats, "sweeps," and indiscriminate bombings of US imperialism have failed.
      "The American imperialist aggressors taught us how to fight, and we defeated them." Seventy-three-year-old Grandpa Fan Wenwu said excitedly to us: "They come to 'sweep,' and we learn how to counter 'sweep' and defeat them; they have airplanes and artillery, and we have combat villages, rifles, and air and artillery defense works. Airplanes cannot enter underground tunnels, and armored vehicles cannot enter underground passages. Revolutionary people are fearless. We have learned how to deal with the enemy from the struggle, and we can defeat the enemy." (Attached picture)
    His words reveal a truth: war educates the people, and the people will surely win the war.　　This reporter, Dai Feng

    人民战争的堡垒
    西贡市郊采访记之三
    革命人民办法多
    南越西贡嘉定地区刚建立小块解放区时，美伪集团三天两头派兵“扫荡”。一九六三年，麦克纳马拉亲自定了个计划，把西贡嘉定地区列为“扫荡”重点，调来整营整师的伪军，驻在乡里，十天半月地不断进行“扫荡”。今年开始，美国侵略军对西贡市郊进行了规模更大的“扫荡”，每次出动成千近万人马。美军飞机成吨成吨地扔炸弹，据点里的大炮整夜整夜地乱轰。美国侵略者想用灭绝人性的“扫荡”和狂轰滥炸，迫使南越人民屈服，重占解放区。
    美帝国主义这样已经闹了好几年了，闹出了个什么结果呢？西贡嘉定地区解放区在困难的情况下，坚持住了，而且解放区从小块渐渐变成了大块。当地人民经过顽强的斗争，锻炼得更加坚强了。古芝县润德乡的人们说：“美帝国主义再凶再恶，我们也不怕，我们革命人民办法多，总能制胜它的。”而武装的战斗村，这个群众在斗争中的新创造，正是发挥人民战争威力，战胜敌人，保卫解放区的好办法。
    D乡离西贡市不过二十来公里，全乡五个自然村，二百多户人家。乡的四周有好些个美伪军据点，最近的离乡三四公里，最远的七八公里。那一年，D乡人民奋起捣毁了“战略村”，解放了全乡。最初，美伪军来“扫荡”，群众都躲开，“扫荡”一次，全乡遭一次殃。美伪军来的次数多，人民的生产和生活都受影响。
    事实教育了人民：光躲不是办法。他们说：“村连村，乡连乡，我们要武装起来，组织起来，坚持就地斗争。”
    人们在斗争中发挥了高度的创造性，D乡建立了战斗村，战斗村在斗争中诞生、成长、壮大。
    今天的D乡战斗村是一座真正的人民战争的堡垒。全村的布防十分严密。当我们沿着宽阔的沙土地行走时，我们看到一人深的交通壕纵横交错，村村相连。我们在一个村子看见，大路上，小径边，草丛里，竖起一个接一个的竹竿架子，这是下设陷阱的标记。一俟战斗警报传来，人们有组织地把这些架子撤掉。尖桩陷阱，布置得非常巧妙，有长方的，有圆的。陷阱挖得很深，数十根锋利的竹尖朝天竖直，人掉下去，多半是没命的。这里的陷阱是如此之多，布置是如此之巧，因此敌人进村，要不掉进陷阱是不可能的。有一次，美伪军进村“扫荡”，带来了现代化的扫雷器，一点也没用。六个伪军，一个美军“顾问”，先后纷纷落阱丧了命。村的外围有铁丝网、篱笆、尖桩和地雷阵等工事，村头和村里挖着许多单人掩体和暗堡等战斗工事。我们到村外的路上，游击队长把枪往地上一搁，用手指着我们的脚边说：“这儿有地道口，你们找找看。”我们弯下腰仔细察看，找了好久，失败了。游击队长笑着走前一步，伸手往地上拨弄了两下，一个地道口就在我们眼前揭开了。你顺着这个口下去走一趟吧，这简直是地下长城。
    “敌人发现过地道口没有？”我们问。
    “从来没有。”
    “发现了也没用。”一个游击队员插口说。为了证明他的意见正确，他又随即讲了一件事。有一次，美伪军在邻村找到了一个地道口，真是欢喜若狂，可是谁也不敢下洞。他们立刻用直升飞机从西贡运来了抽水机，往地道里灌水。地道好象蓄水池似的，成吨成吨的水灌进去，没有一点动静。美伪军又搬来了炸药炸。一直闹到太阳落山，连个游击队的影子也没有发现。他们只好垂头丧气地走了。
    当然，光靠战斗村的严密布防毕竟是不够的，如果人民不能全体动员起来，决心战斗，那末战斗村也不能发挥战斗堡垒的威力。这方面，西贡嘉定地区的解放区人民，在长期的斗争中，积累了丰富的经验。当地的人们说：“发动群众，组织起来，有领导地捣毁‘战略村’，打碎基层伪政权，铲除恶棍，建立群众组织，建立自管政权，建立游击队，这是展开平原地区战斗村游击战的基本之点，而建立一支坚强的游击武装则是关键。”
      经验是打出来的
    战斗村的强大威力，就在于游击队善于利用战斗村的熟悉地形和战斗布防，在人民群众的支持下歼灭来犯敌人。
    D乡战斗村有一支坚强的游击队。游击队员都是本乡本村的青年小伙子和年轻姑娘。他们从敌人手里夺取武器，武装了自己。刚开始，游击队没有战斗经验。最初曾发生过这样的事：美伪军来“扫荡”，游击队一涌而上，没有等敌人挨近，噼噼啪啪随处放起枪来。待敌人疯狂反扑时，游击队子弹差不多打光了，顶不住，不得不转移。这件事告诉了游击队一个经验：要打胜仗，必须总结和创造自己的经验。
    后来，游击队打仗时，分成了机动灵活的战斗小组。有的埋地雷，有的打伏击，有的转到敌人屁股后边打奇袭，打巧仗。有一次，美国“顾问”领了一帮伪军进村，游击队先不打，把敌人放进来，待到敌人进入陷阱区时，游击队从四面八方打枪，美伪军一听枪声，急忙四散乱跑，一个个中计掉进了陷阱。美军“顾问”也落下陷阱。伪军惊慌万状，再不敢前进一步，拖起陷阱里的美国“顾问”，没命地往回逃跑。
  敌人几次进犯D乡战斗村都吃了亏，不敢走着进村，改乘M—113两栖装甲车进村“扫荡”。这种装甲车，游击队管它叫“牛屎虫”，四周有个铁皮壳，美伪军钻在里面，既不怕陷阱，也不怕游击队的冷枪。美国侵略者把M—113装甲车吹嘘为攻击游击队的最好武器。它们刚出现在西贡市郊时，故意不走平坦大道，光捡坏路走，碰到小树，狠命地一撞，把树干撞倒，显显威力，吓唬人民。
    这一次，美伪军到D乡战斗村“扫荡”，分乘了十六辆M—113装甲车。D乡战斗村的人们在敌人来“扫荡”之前，就作了战斗准备。游击队长阮文古把游击队员和群众召集起来说：“打‘牛屎虫’，我们没有经验，大家说，打不打？”游击队员和群众说“怎么不打！”“不打能行？”“谁有经验，经验是打出来的。”群众和游击队员，你一言，我一语地嚷开了。游击队长眼看大家战斗情绪高涨，十分高兴地说：“好，我们一定要打，怎么个打法，大伙再想想。”这一天，游击队和群众一起作战斗准备，他们扛着土造的“一○五地雷”埋在要道口。群众插竹尖、布陷阱。游击队员一蹦一跳地奔进伏击工事。游击队长伏在头里，浓眉下的一双圆眼，直直地望着进村的大道。眼见一辆M—113装甲车由远渐近地开过来了，驶近地雷前，突然停住了。“糟糕！”游击队长急得直冒汗，心想：“地雷被发现了？”这时，装甲车上的机枪“??”响起来，密集的子弹钻进树丛，把树叶簌簌地打落下来。游击队长听着敌人的枪声，立刻正确判断，敌人企图试探游击队的火力，中止了前进。他微微抬起头，向后边的游击队员递了一个眼色，要大家沉住气。M—113装甲车响了一阵机枪，见没有一点动静，又往前移动起来。“拉！”游击队长一声命令，只听见“轰”地一声，M—113装甲车被滚滚浓烟包围。车履带“唰”的断开了。游击队长趁着浓烟，抱起手榴弹，跳出工事，一阵风似地扑到炸翻了的装甲车边，只听得车里的敌人，叽叽哇哇，连哭带嚎。游击队长眼明手快，拉开手榴弹引火线，扔进车窗，手榴弹连续爆炸，车里再也没有一点响声了。接着又有几辆M—113装甲车隆隆地开了过来，但是，一辆都不敢越过被炸毁的车子。一面盲目地朝四周胡乱打枪，一面丢出绳索，拉着被炸翻的车骸撤退了。这是西贡市郊游击队第一次用土地雷打毁美军M—113装甲车。这个胜利再次证明决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是什么新武器。这个胜利大大鼓舞了当地人民的斗争意志。
    D乡战斗村的游击队在群众的有力配合下，愈战愈强。一九六四年这支游击队作战七十二次。有一次，他们和一营敌人打了十三天。游击队灵活机动，从村外打到村里，白天打，夜里打，接连打死敌人一百三十五名，而游击队只有一人负伤。
    “去年，”游击队长对我们说：“我们游击队作战五十六次。不过都不是在自己村里打的。”
    “这就是说，敌人根本不敢进村来了？”我们问。
    “是这样，敌人不敢来，我们游击队只能打出去。现在，我们配合地方武装，到公路上，到敌人据点附近去打，这不能不算是个变化吧！”游击队长意味深长地说。
    飞机、装甲车进不了地洞
    西贡嘉定地区解放区的建立、巩固和扩大，也不是一帆风顺的。这里的解放区经历了扩大、缩小和再扩大的复杂曲折的斗争过程。人民力量在顽强的斗争中锻炼、壮大了自己，发扬了高度的革命精神和创造性，经住了考验，战胜了敌人。我们在这里访问的日子里，到处看到了人民革命英雄主义的大无畏气概和生动的创造性斗争事例。
    战斗村的老乡，人人都是战士。战斗一响，男女老幼，都紧守自己的战斗岗位。他们和游击队一起，在硝烟火海中同敌人搏斗。他们手挽手同敌人进行面对面的政治斗争。在战斗的岁月里，他们已经锻炼出一种无比英雄的革命气概，并且养成了井然的战斗生活秩序。但是，每当我们向他们表示敬佩时，他们总是谦虚地对我们说：“没有什么，紧张的战斗生活，我们早已习惯了。”
    的确，西贡市郊解放区的人民已经对激烈的战斗生活习以为常了。现在，美伪军已经不敢从地面上轻易进犯解放区。他们改用飞机炸，大炮轰，对解放区实行所谓“焦土”轰炸。就在离西贡市一二十公里处，美国侵略者使用了B—52战略轰炸机，连续狂轰滥炸。天刚擦黑，什么一○五、一五五、二○三口径的大炮，整夜对解放区乱轰。但是，敌人的疯狂轰炸和炮击，就连十来多岁的儿童都不害怕。
    敌机来袭时，战斗村的游击队迅速进入对空射击阵地，他们用步枪对俯冲的美国飞贼射击。尽管弹片纷飞，但是，游击队的对空阵地巍然屹立。D乡战斗村的游击队就用步枪打落过美国直升飞机。群众虽然不能象游击队一样拿枪打飞机，但是，他们创造了一套同敌机轰炸作斗争的有效办法。当地的人们几乎都知道，应该怎样对付F—105战斗轰炸机，又应该怎样对付B—52战略轰炸机。人们用挖很深很隐蔽的防空洞和交通壕这种办法，顶住了美国飞贼的野蛮轰炸。
    战斗村的每家每户，除了几块床板和简单的桌椅之外，室内很少有其他东西。人们把有用的东西都分散和埋藏起来。粮食放在秘密的藏粮洞里。床席、箱子、被褥分散搁在树丛里。家家户户屋内都挖有一个很深的地下室，四周砌着一层厚土，或者堆放着大石块。室内很整洁，床铺上挂着雪白的蚊帐，墙壁上贴着“坚决战胜美帝国主义侵略者”的标语。敌人炮击时，当地人民就进入地下室里睡觉。几年来，D乡战斗村落下的炮弹是多得无法计算的，但是全村没有一个人牺牲于炮弹下的。不仅如此，就连耕牛都筑有坚固隐蔽的防御地洞。
    战斗村里的人们怎样在炮火纷飞中坚持田间生产的呢？我们在村里走了一圈，没有看见一块荒地。田里的稻苗长得非常好。村边屋前屋后的旱地上，大叶菜、空心菜，以及当地人称之为“人参”的植物，长得绿油一片。村里人告诉我们，解放前许多贫雇农户常年缺粮，现在分了地，组织五个生产互助组，全村没有一户缺粮户。农民们政治上翻了身，战斗、生产，热情高涨。他们一手拿枪，一手扶犁，坚持原地战斗，原地生产。他们几乎在每一块田边都挖了防御工事。人们下田劳动时，游击队背上枪来回巡逻。即使出现了敌机也没有关系，人们都善于判断飞机的航向和弹落点。敌机低空掠过，人们很镇静，只有当炸弹朝他们方向落下时，他们才迅速跳进田边地洞。人们说：“美国飞贼们终究不能轰炸每一块田地的。我们摸到了他们的规律，就能制胜他们，照样劳动生产。”
    美伪集团一直妄图拔掉西贡市郊解放区这面旗帜，但是他们总是无法得逞。解放区每一个战斗村都是一个独立的战斗单位，战斗村与战斗村之间又互相配合，互相支援，构成了一个有机的完整的战斗体系，牵制打击敌人，陷敌于人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    D乡战斗村是西贡市郊许多战斗村中的一个，也是越南南方解放区成千上万个战斗村的一个缩影。这个战斗村可以说就在敌人眼皮底下，但是，这面旗帜长年来迎风飘扬。
    是什么力量支持了当地人民顽强的斗争意志？在战斗村的村中心，我们看到竖立着一座仇恨碑。仇恨碑正面写着一百二十五个殉难烈士的姓名。战斗村的每一户农民家庭都遭受过迫害。阶级仇，民族恨，在每个人的心中燃成斗争的烈火。在革命的人民面前，在组织了严密战斗体系的人民面前，美帝国主义的一切恐吓、“扫荡”、狂轰滥炸都失败了。
      “美帝国主义侵略者教会了我们打仗，我们打赢了他们。”七十三岁的老大爷范文悟激动地对我们说：“他们来‘扫荡’，我们学会了反‘扫荡’，打败他们；他们有飞机大炮，我们有战斗村，有步枪，有防空、防炮工事，飞机是进不了地洞的，装甲车是进不了地道的。革命人民是无所畏惧的，我们从斗争中学会了对付敌人，我们就能够战胜敌人。”（附图片）
