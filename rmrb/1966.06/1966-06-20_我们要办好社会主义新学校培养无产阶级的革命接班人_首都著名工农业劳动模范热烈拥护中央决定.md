    We Must Run Socialist New Schools Well to Cultivate Revolutionary Successors of the Proletariat
    Prominent Labor Models of Industry and Agriculture in the Capital Enthusiastically Support the Central Committee's Decision
    (Xinhua News Agency, June 19th) After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced their decision on reforming the methods of enrollment and examination for institutions of higher learning, our reporter visited prominent labor models of industry and agriculture in the capital. All of them, with feelings of excitement and inspiration, expressed their heartfelt support for this wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically hailed it as a result of the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and another new victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    Ni Zhifu, a famous advanced producer and worker-engineer, said: "We workers wholeheartedly support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Facts have shown that unless the bourgeois 'authorities' in the educational field are thoroughly overthrown and the educational positions occupied by the bourgeoisie are seized, it is absolutely impossible to thoroughly reform the educational system." Ni Zhifu used his own personal experience to illustrate the importance of thoroughly reforming the educational system. He said, "In the old society, I only attended school intermittently for three years. After liberation, the Party cultivated me to enter spare-time schools and secondary technical schools, and gradually I grew into our working class's own engineer. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao not only led us to achieve liberation politically, but also led us to become masters of science and culture. However, some bourgeois masters always thought we workers were 'stupid' and tried various methods to attack us, satirize us, and restrict us. I have encountered such things. Why are these bourgeois masters so afraid of us workers mastering cultural knowledge? Now it is very clear. They are competing with us working people for leadership in the cultural field, attempting to occupy the educational positions, cultivate their bourgeois successors, and want to climb back on our heads to oppress us again."
    Shi Chuanxiang, delegate to the National People's Congress and famous nightsoil worker, said: "This wise and great decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao speaks the words in the hearts of us workers. Chairman Mao is so thoughtful for us, we workers and peasants have long wanted to master the pen." Shi Chuanxiang used his own experience to talk about how the children of workers and peasants were shut out of the school gates in the old society. He said, "I didn't go to school for a single day in the old society. But the young masters and misses of the nightsoil capitalist's family in the old society could study without leaving their homes. When we carrying the nightsoil passed by their doors, they said we smelled bad."
    Shi Chuanxiang said that he now has four children in school, the eldest of whom has already graduated from high school. In order to thoroughly carry out the Great Cultural Revolution and eradicate revisionism from the root, I told my children to go to the countryside to participate in labor, and first obtain a "ideologically qualified certificate" issued by the poor and lower-middle peasants, so that they will never change their color. He said that only by thoroughly reforming the educational system, only by combining children with workers, peasants, and soldiers, will revisionism not emerge, and can we cultivate our sons and grandsons into successors of the proletariat.
    Chen Guolin, an old trolleybus driver, recalled the past and said, "In the old society, there was no right for our working people's children to study! Before liberation, my eldest daughter, Yu Min, saw the children of rich people going to school and clamored to go too. I drove a trolleybus during the day and pedaled a tricycle at night. I tried so hard but still couldn't make ends meet, and the family couldn't even get enough to eat. In the end, I had to force my child to drop out of school." After liberation, Chen Guolin's eldest daughter, Yu Min, went back to school, and after graduating from high school, she took up an educational post. Chen Guolin said, "I must educate Yu Min to conscientiously implement the policy proposed by Chairman Mao that education should serve proletarian politics and that education should be combined with productive labor, and cultivate the children of our broad masses of working people, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary martyrs into laborers who read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and develop morally, intellectually, and physically, becoming cultured laborers with socialist consciousness, so that children will never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget highlighting politics, and never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, so as to safeguard our red country."
    Zhang Tilun, Party Branch Secretary of the Nan Zhangdai Brigade of the Menlouzhuang Commune in Pinggu County and an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, said very excitedly: "The decision of the Party Central Committee is too wise, it really gladdens the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives in the education sector used 'scores' to implement a cultural dictatorship over our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, keeping our poor and lower-middle peasant children outside the gates of universities. Why can't the children of poor and lower-middle peasants get into university? It is the result of their implementation of 'score in command.'" Zhang Tilun said happily: "In the future, if bourgeois revisionist elements want to rule us poor and lower-middle peasants culturally, that will never happen! With the decision of the Party Central Committee and the instructions of Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to seize back the proletarian positions in the schools."
    Li Zonghe, Party Branch Secretary of the Baipenyao Brigade of the Huangtugang Commune and a famous labor model, said happily that reforming the college entrance examination method is a major measure to thoroughly liberate us poor and lower-middle peasants, a major guarantee for our proletariat to forever hold the seal of power, and a great good thing for Mao Zedong Thought to lead our sons and grandsons in making revolution. Those bourgeois masters occupied our educational positions. It has been more than ten years since liberation, and not a single child of the poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade has gone to university. Is it because they are stupid? No, it is the hateful education system that harmed us. They only want scores, not politics. What is the use of scores? Putting scores first can only hinder students from studying Chairman Mao's works and promote young people to take the bourgeois road of being both Red and expert. What we want are politics, students armed with Mao Zedong Thought, studying for the revolution, and wholeheartedly serving proletarian politics. The Party Central Committee's wise decision speaks the minds of our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. I agree with it one hundred percent. I raise both hands in support.
    Yin Weichen, delegate to the National People's Congress, famous labor model, and Party Branch Secretary of the Huangtugang Brigade, said: "Hearing the broadcast of the Central Committee's decision, I feel particularly happy. One graduating class from Xinfadi Primary School had seventeen students promoted to middle school, only two of whom were children of poor and lower-middle peasants. At that time, I was very angry. Why is the standard for promotion based only on scores? I raised this issue at the Beijing Poor Peasants Association meeting, but those bourgeois masters didn't pay any attention to it. Now that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have proposed to thoroughly reform the education system, it has made me see this issue even more clearly. It turns out that the bourgeoisie is cultivating their successors, attempting to turn our next generation into revisionists, and attempting to continue to ride on our heads. I warn that small handful of bourgeois masters that we have the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we will thoroughly smash your old system, run socialist new schools, and cultivate our own proletarian successors. From primary school to university, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, so that Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down from generation to generation, and our country will never change color."

    我们要办好社会主义新学校培养无产阶级的革命接班人
    首都著名工农业劳动模范热烈拥护中央决定
    据新华社十九日讯　中共中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定公布后，本社记者走访了首都著名工农业劳动模范，他们无不怀着振奋和激动的心情，表示打心眼里拥护党中央、毛主席的这个英明决定，热烈欢呼这是无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的成果，是伟大毛泽东思想的又一个新胜利。
    著名先进生产者、工人工程师倪志福说：党中央和毛主席的英明决定，我们工人打心眼里拥护。事实说明，不彻底打倒教育界的资产阶级“权威”，不夺取资产阶级霸占的教育阵地，要想彻底改革教育制度，是绝对办不到的。倪志福以自己的亲身经历说明彻底改革教育制度的重要性。他说，在旧社会，我只断断续续念了三年书。解放后，党培养我进业余学校，上中等技术学校，逐步成长为我们工人阶级自己的工程师。党中央、毛主席不但领导我们在政治上翻了身，而且领导我们要做科学文化的主人。可是，某些资产阶级老爷们总认为我们工人“笨”，想了种种办法打击我们，讽刺我们，限制我们。我就遇到过这种事情。这批资产阶级老爷们，为什么这样害怕我们工人掌握文化知识呢？现在看来是十分清楚的。他们是在和我们劳动人民争夺文化领域的领导权，妄想霸占教育阵地，培养他们资产阶级的接班人，想重新爬到我们头上来欺压我们。
    全国人民代表大会代表、著名掏粪工人时传祥说：党中央、毛主席这个英明伟大的决定，说出了我们工人的心里话。毛主席他老人家为俺们想得太周到了，俺们工农早就想掌握笔杆子。时传祥以切身的体会谈了旧社会工农子弟是如何被关在校门之外的。他说，“我在旧社会没念一天书。可是旧社会粪霸资本家的少爷小姐，不出家门就可以读书，我们背粪的孩子从门口过一下，他们就说我们臭。”
    时传祥说，我现在有四个孩子都在念书，大孩子已经高中毕业。为了彻底搞好文化大革命，从根上挖掉修正主义，我叫我的孩子下农村参加劳动，先取得贫下中农发给的“思想合格证书”，让他们永不变色。他说，只有彻底改革教育制度，只有叫孩子们和工农兵结合，才不会出修正主义，才能把我们子子孙孙培养成为无产阶级的接班人。
    老电车司机陈国霖回忆往事说，旧社会那有我们劳动人民子女读书的权利！解放前，我的大女儿玉敏看见有钱人家的孩子上学，也闹着要去。我白天在电车上开车，晚上还蹬三轮，就这样拼命地奔还不行，一家人连饭都吃不饱，最后还是硬逼着孩子退学了。解放后，陈国霖的大女儿玉敏重新上了学，高中毕业后走上教育工作岗位。陈国霖说，我一定要教育玉敏认真执行毛主席提出的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，把咱广大劳动人民的子女，革命干部、革命军人和革命烈士的子女个个培养成为读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，让孩子们从小就念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，保住我们的红色江山。
    平谷县门楼庄公社南张岱大队党支部书记、学习毛主席著作积极分子张体伦非常兴奋地说：“党中央的决定太英明了，真是大快贫下中农的心。过去，教育界一小撮反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，用‘分数’向我们广大贫下中农实行文化专政，把我们贫下中农子弟关在高等学校大门以外。为什么贫下中农子女考不上大学，就是他们实行了分数挂帅的结果。”张体伦高兴地说：“以后资产阶级修正主义分子还想在文化上统治我们贫下中农，那就永远办不到！有了党中央的决定、毛主席的指示，我们一定能把学校的无产阶级阵地夺回来。”
    黄土岗公社白盆窑大队的党总支书记、著名劳动模范李宗和高兴地说，改革高校招考办法，这是叫我们贫下中农彻底翻身的重大措施，是让我们无产阶级永远掌握印把子的重大保证，是让毛泽东思想领导我们子子孙孙闹革命的大好事。那些资产阶级老爷们把持我们的教育阵地，解放十几年了，我们大队贫下中农子女连一个上大学的都没有。是笨吗？不是，是可恶的教育制度害了我们。他们只要分数，不要政治。分数有什么用？分数第一只能阻碍学生学习毛主席著作，促使青年走资产阶级的白专道路。我们要的是政治，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，为革命而学习的，全心全意为无产阶级政治服务的好学生。党中央这个英明的决定说出了我们广大贫下中农的心里话。我一百个赞成。我举双手拥护。
    全国人民代表大会代表、著名劳动模范、黄土岗大队党总支书记殷维臣说：听了中央决定的广播，我心里特别痛快。新发地小学毕业一个班，有十七个人升上中学，其中只有两个是贫下中农子女。当时我非常气愤，能不能升学的标准，为什么只按分数？在北京市贫协会上我提出这个问题，可是那帮资产阶级老爷们根本不理这个茬儿。现在党中央、毛主席提出要彻底改革教育制度，使我更加看清楚了这个问题，原来是资产阶级在培养他们的接班人，妄想使我们的下一代变成修正主义，妄想仍然骑在我们的头上。警告那一小撮资产阶级老爷们，我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，我们要彻底砸碎你们那一套旧制度，办成社会主义的新学校，培养我们无产阶级自己的接班人。从小学到大学都要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，让毛泽东思想代代相传，使我们的国家永不变色。
