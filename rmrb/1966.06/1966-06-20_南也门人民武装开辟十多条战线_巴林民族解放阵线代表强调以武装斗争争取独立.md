    据新华社阿尔及尔电　被占领的南也门解放阵线总书记阿卜杜勒·卡维·马卡维最近在阿尔及尔举行的记者招待会上说：被占领的南也门解放阵线将继续进行反对英殖民主义及其代理人的武装斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    他说：被占领的南也门人民的武装斗争正在南也门各地区爆发和发展。现在，南也门人民已经开辟了十多条战线。
    据新华社开罗电　据中东通讯社报道，被占领的南也门解放阵线驻开罗办事处最近说，解放阵线的军队对亚丁的英国兵营发动了多次袭击，打伤英国兵四名。
    亚丁民族主义者四日炸毁了通向亚丁港的主要输油管。五月中旬，民族主义者曾炸毁了这个地区的一段输油管和英国石油公司的油库。
  据新华社开罗十五日电　巴林民族解放阵线驻开罗代表赛义夫·本·阿里十四日晚上在这里接见新华社记者时指出，美帝国主义是巴林人民的头号敌人。他说：“武装斗争是巴林人民实现民族独立的唯一可选择的道路，现在我国已经开始了武装斗争。”
    他说，在其他帝国主义中，美国享有巴林石油利益的大部分。美国还有权使用英国在那里的军事基地，因此，美帝国主义是巴林人民的头号敌人。
