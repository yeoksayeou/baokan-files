    Shandong Province's Guan County people, wielding the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, overcame a long period of severe drought and achieved a good wheat harvest this year. The county's 290,000 mu of wheat achieved an average yield per mu increase of more than 30% compared to last year, creating the county's highest level of wheat yield per unit area in history, and many high-yield units emerged.
    The vast number of cadres and masses in the county unanimously believe that this is a victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought. This fact is another powerful rebuff to those bourgeois "authority" old men who maliciously slander Mao Zedong Thought.

    山东冠县战胜干旱小麦增产
    山东省冠县人民运用毛泽东思想的强大武器，战胜了较长时间的严重干旱，夺得了今年小麦的好收成。全县二十九万亩小麦，平均亩产量比去年增长三成以上，创造了这个县历史上小麦单位面积产量的最高水平，并且出现了很多高产单位。
    全县广大干部和群众一致认为，这是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。这一事实，是对那些恶意污蔑毛泽东思想的资产阶级“权威”老爷们的又一次有力的回击。
