    Peasant Revolutionary Paintings
    Editor's Note: A mass proletarian cultural revolution is unfolding rapidly and vigorously. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are stepping onto the socialist cultural stage with the attitude of masters. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, they treat revolutionary literature and art as "powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy," and have created many literary and artistic works that praise our great Party and our great Chairman Mao, and praise our socialist cause and heroic figures. The peasant paintings from Hu County, Shaanxi, introduced in this newspaper today, are paintings that embody Mao Zedong Thought in literature and art, paintings that highlight politics, and paintings that highlight class struggle. Such paintings are excellent!
    Bourgeois "authority" lords have always looked down upon the literary and artistic works of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They always use reactionary class prejudices to slander the works of workers, peasants, and soldiers as "simple," "low-level," and "crude." They occupy many literary and artistic positions and do not allow workers, peasants, and soldiers to enter this "forbidden zone." However, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to despise "authorities," pick up their pens, write and paint extensively, and actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, allowing literature and art to serve proletarian politics. As can be seen from these paintings and articles by the peasants of Hu County, once the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers master Mao Zedong Thought, they will burst forth with unlimited wisdom and creative talent. They are truly the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution and will exert increasingly powerful combat effectiveness.

    农民的革命画
    编者按：一场群众性的无产阶级文化大革命，正在迅速猛烈地展开。广大工农兵群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以主人公姿态，大踏步地登上社会主义文化舞台。他们根据毛主席的教导，把革命文艺当作“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，创作了许多歌颂我们伟大的党和伟大的毛主席，歌颂我们社会主义事业和英雄人物的文艺作品。本报今天介绍的陕西户县农民的画，是体现毛泽东文艺思想的画，是突出政治的画，是突出阶级斗争的画。这样的画，好得很！
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们，从来看不起工农兵的文艺作品。他们总是以反动阶级的偏见，污蔑工农兵的作品“简单”、“低级”、“粗糙”。他们霸占着许多文艺阵地，不准工农兵进入这块“禁区”。可是，以毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，敢于蔑视“权威”，拿起笔杆子，大写大画，积极参加文化大革命，让文艺为无产阶级政治服务。从户县农民这些画和文章中可以看出，广大工农兵群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就会迸发出无限的智慧和创造才能，他们真正是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，并且将发挥越来越强大的战斗力。
