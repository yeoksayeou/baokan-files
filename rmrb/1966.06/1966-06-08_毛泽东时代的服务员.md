    Waiters of the Mao Zedong Era
    Qin Ye
    Every morning and evening, the Xinqiao Hotel warmly welcomes and sends off batches of foreign guests, conveying the friendship of the Chinese people to them. The travelers come from all over the world. They come to New China to perform, travel, compete, interview, trade… The waiters on the fourth floor of “Xinqiao” work diligently day and night to complete their glorious reception tasks.
  Morning is the busiest time on the fourth floor. Several middle-aged waiters are carrying hygiene buckets in the bath pool. An old waiter with white hair is quickly washing tea sets on the dish rack. A young man is deftly pushing a cart of hot water bottles through the corridor. A low, hoarse telephone ring comes from the service desk. The waiter deftly goes over, picks up the microphone, covers his mouth with one hand, and says something softly. At this time, seven or eight waiters are shuttling back and forth, but the surroundings are still quiet. Where has the usual noise of the hotel gone? It turns out that in order to create a quiet and comfortable environment, the waiters have put rubber pads on many utensils that can make noise, nailed sponges on the top and bottom of the doors, replaced the service desk with a low-tone telephone, and even replaced the small cart with two rubber wheels. How much effort have they spent to ensure that the guests have a good rest!
    Thinking of Chairman Mao's Words in Their Hearts
    In the past, some young people said that being a waiter was just “setting up and taking away, laying and folding,” and they felt that their work was uninteresting. However, after highlighting politics, the mental outlook of the waiters quickly changed. Last year, the Party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People." Many people said:
  "Chairman Mao taught us to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly, and to be a person like Comrade Bethune who has no selfish intentions. The foreign guests who stay in our hotel are invited by the Party and the state. We actively and enthusiastically serve the foreign guests so that they can see the new thoughts and new customs of the Chinese people. This is also serving the people." Communist Party member Li Hongshu said: "Don't think that what we do are all small things, but we must always think of the country in our hearts. When we serve a cup of tea or send a towel to foreign guests, it also contains the friendship of the Chinese people!"
    Once proletarian politics are highlighted, many "small things" seem to be painted with brilliant colors. A British couple had stayed at "Xinqiao" four times, and recently they came again. The fourth-floor waiters were very happy to see them. After get off work, they specially visited the waiters who had received these two foreign guests several times before. Hearing that the foreign guests wanted to drink coffee as soon as they woke up, the waiters saw the light in the room and immediately sent boiling water for him to make coffee. At night, seeing him often sitting on the sofa reading materials, they found a floor lamp and placed it behind the sofa. Once, the foreign guest accidentally dropped the towel on the floor, and they immediately replaced it with a clean one. Before leaving, the foreign guest wrote with satisfaction: "Your service in all aspects is the best. We have to commend and express our heartfelt thanks for the attentive and satisfactory service you provided."
    Last autumn, a guest from overseas fell ill. The doctor gave him a large package of herbs and red dates. The waiters boiled a small handful of herbs with seven red dates every day, and sent the soup to the guest on time, never delaying. Seeing that the patient didn't want to eat, they patiently gave him ideas and advised him to eat some porridge or soft food. The guest recovered from his illness and left these words before leaving: "Staying in the hotel is like staying at home. This can only happen in a socialist society. Only revolutionary comrades can have such love, such kindness and warmth…."
    This is Supporting the Vietnamese Brothers
    An exciting message came: The Vietnamese song and dance troupe from the front line of the anti-American struggle was coming to China to perform. Hearing this good news, the waiters thought: "The Vietnamese comrades are fighting the US imperialists fiercely on the front line day and night. They are really too tired! We must treat the Vietnamese comrades well. This is also the support of our Chinese people for the Vietnamese anti-American struggle." So, some comrades studied Vietnamese overnight, and many people inquired everywhere about the living habits and hobbies of Vietnamese friends.
    On the day when dozens of comrades from the Vietnamese song and dance troupe arrived, the comrades of the fourth-floor service group were already waiting at the door. As soon as the car stopped, they rushed to carry the luggage. As soon as the foreign guests were seated, they brought hot tea and fresh fruit. Hearing that Vietnamese friends love flowers, the waiters used glass silk to weave beautiful and delicate small flowers, small butterflies, and small peaches, and hung them on the tea cup lids. The Vietnamese friends were very happy to see these lovely little things. Some Vietnamese girls picked off the little flowers and treasured them as souvenirs.
    One morning, a Vietnamese comrade had several friends come to visit. The waiters repeatedly set up chairs, served tea, and sent towels, diligently entertaining the guests. When the Vietnamese comrade sent the guests to the elevator and returned, in just two minutes, the waiters had cleaned the room very neatly. The Vietnamese foreign guest exclaimed: "We Vietnamese can shoot down American planes like ghosts, but your service work is also done like ghosts!"
    The tense performance began. The waiters knew that the Vietnamese friends must be very tired. They calculated when the foreign guests would be back, so they opened the door first, lowered the curtains, turned on the lights, and removed the bedspread, so that the Vietnamese friends could have a good lunch and quickly have a wonderful nap. The Vietnamese friends said moved: "Your reception work is simply done into our hearts."
    Before the comrades of the song and dance troupe returned to their country, they invited the waiters to their rooms, warmly sang Chinese and Vietnamese revolutionary songs for them, and left letters of enthusiastic thanks. Comrade Pham Dinh Loc, head of the Vietnamese song and dance troupe, said: "...Only brothers who are as close as flesh and blood, who share weal and woe, and who share life and death, can have this kind of love and care for us. ...Let us meet when we defeat the US imperialists! At that time, we will stay here longer, and we will serve the Chinese people with our performances. We want to have a get-together with you to celebrate our common victory!"
    We are Socialist Waiters
    Some guests from the capitalist world, seeing that the Chinese waiters were working so enthusiastically and thoughtfully, often took out some tips or gifts to give to the waiters. Therefore, some interesting "twists and turns" often occur in the "tips" issue.
    Last November, Zhou Decun went to the door to greet an Italian guest and helped the guest carry two large suitcases. The first question the foreign guest asked was: "How much does it cost to carry these two pieces of luggage?" Zhou Decun said: "We don't accept tips." The foreign guest asked again: "Is it just you who don't accept tips, or does your entire country not accept tips?" He replied: "Not only does the Xinqiao Hotel not accept tips, but other places also don't accept tips." The foreign guest shrugged his shoulders and said: "This is the first time I have encountered a country that does not accept tips." Then, he asked: "If you don't accept tips, can you make a living?" Zhou Decun put down the luggage and said proudly: "We have a salary every month, labor protection, and free medical care when we get sick. We live a very good life."
    Later, every time Zhou Decun brought him coffee, the foreign guest still wanted to give a tip. Once, when he handed the guest the change of one jiao and five fen, the foreign guest shook his hand repeatedly, pushed Zhou Decun's hand holding the change back, and asked him to put the money quietly into his pocket. The young waiter smiled and said: "No, no, thank you." He put the change on the coffee table and left the room.
    When this foreign guest left, he patted the waiter on the shoulder and said: "I came to China for two weeks, and you don't want money or things. You have given me a profound education. The level of awareness of the Chinese people is indeed high."
    When the waiters find things lost by foreign guests, they always try their best to find the owner. They said: "Even losing a pair of socks is not a small matter, this is related to the ethos of our socialist New China." Sometimes when guests leave the hotel, they rush to the train station and airport to return the lost items to him; if they really can't catch up, they must find a way to return the things they find to the foreign guests.
    One morning at five o'clock, a waiter sent an Italian foreign guest to the lobby downstairs. He thought: "Could the guest have left anything behind?" He ran back to room 445 quickly. He first lay on the ground to look under the bed, and then turned over the bed. Then he moved the sofa away, and quickly opened all the drawers of the writing desk and wardrobe. Fortunately, nothing was found. When he turned around to go out, he suddenly saw a pile of waste products left by the guest in the corner. He casually rummaged through it, and a verdant jade brooch rolled out of the pile of garbage. At this time, he couldn't think of anything else, and ran straight downstairs. Fortunately, the foreign guest was still waiting for the car at the door. When the waiter appeared at the door with the brooch, the foreign guest hugged the waiter. He said gratefully: "This is my favorite thing, how could I have left it behind! I am very grateful to you, your work is too meticulous."
    The waiters of "Xinqiao" are holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting proletarian politics, and serving foreign guests from all over the world wholeheartedly. Whenever some foreign friends talk about the work of Chinese waiters, they say: "The work of Chinese waiters reflects the superiority of the socialist system of New China. It seems that Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in China."

    毛泽东时代的服务员
    秦叶
    每一个清晨和黄昏，新侨饭店总是热情地迎送着一批又一批的外宾，向他们传送着中国人民的友谊。旅客们来自世界各国。他们来新中国演出、旅行、比赛、采访、贸易……“新侨”四楼的服务员们为了完成光荣的接待任务，日夜辛勤地劳动着。
  早晨，这是四楼最忙的时刻。几位中年服务员正拎着卫生桶在涮澡池。一位头发花白的老服务员在洗皿架上飞快地洗茶具。一个年青人正轻巧地推着一车热水瓶经过通道。服务台上发出一阵低哑的电话铃声，服务员轻捷地过去，拿起话筒，一只手挡着嘴，轻轻地说着什么。这时，有七八个服务员来往穿梭，周围却依然一片宁静。旅店里惯常有的那种嘈杂声到哪儿去了呢？原来，为了创造一个安静舒适的环境，服务员们在许多能发出响声的用具上，都放了胶皮垫，房门上下钉了海绵，服务台换了低音电话，连那辆小推车也换了两个胶皮轱辘。为了使旅客休息好，他们花费了多少心血！
    心里想着毛主席的话
    以前，有的年青人说，当服务员也就是“摆了撤，铺了叠”，觉着干得没有劲儿。可是，突出政治以后，服务员们的精神面貌很快就发生了变化。去年，党支部组织大家学习毛主席的《为人民服务》。许多人说：
  “毛主席教导我们要全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务，做一个象白求恩同志那样的毫无自私自利之心的人。住在咱们饭店的外宾都是党和国家邀请来的，咱们主动热情地为外宾服务，使他们看到中国人民的新思想、新风尚，这也就是为人民服务了。”共产党员李鸿书说：“别看咱们办的尽是小事儿，可心里得时时想着国家。咱们给外宾端一杯茶、送一块毛巾，也都含着中国人民的友谊哩！”
    一突出无产阶级政治，许多“小事儿”仿佛都涂上了灿烂的光彩。有一对英国夫妇，曾经四次住在“新侨”，最近他们又来了。四楼服务员看到他们都非常高兴，下班以后，特意去访问了前几次招待过这两个外宾的服务员。听说外宾一早醒来就要喝咖啡，服务员看到房里的灯一亮，就连忙送去开水给他冲咖啡。夜晚，看到他经常坐在沙发上看材料，他们就找一盏立地台灯，放在沙发后面。有一次，外宾不小心把毛巾掉在地板上，他们马上给换一条干净的。外宾临走时，满意地写道：“你们各方面的服务是最好的。我们不得不为你们提供的周到满意的服务提出表扬和内心的感谢。”
    去年深秋，一位来自海外的客人病了。大夫给他一大包草药和红枣。服务员每天用一小把草药加七个红枣熬了汤，按时送给客人，从来没有耽误过。他们看到病人不想吃东西，就不厌其烦地给他出主意，劝他吃些稀饭或软食。这个客人养好了病，临走前留下了这样几句话：“住店如住家，这只有社会主义的社会，才会有这样的奇迹；只有革命的同志爱，才会有这样的亲切与温暖……。”
    这就是支持越南兄弟
    一个令人兴奋的消息传来了：来自抗美前线的越南歌舞团要到中国演出了。听到这个喜讯，服务员们想：“越南同志日日夜夜在前线狠狠地打击美帝国主义，实在太辛苦啦！咱们一定要把越南同志招待好，这也就是咱们中国人民对越南反美斗争的支持。”于是，有的同志连夜赶学越南语，不少人到处打听越南朋友的生活习惯和爱好。
    越南歌舞团的几十位同志来到的那一天，四楼服务组的同志们早就在门口迎接了。等汽车一停，他们就抢着给搬运行李。外宾们刚刚坐定，就送来了热腾腾的茶水，捧出鲜灵灵的水果。听说越南朋友爱花，服务员们用玻璃丝编出美丽精巧的小花儿、小蝴蝶、小桃儿，挂在茶杯盖上。越南朋友看到这些惹人喜爱的小玩意儿，高兴极了，有些越南姑娘把小花儿摘下来，珍贵地留作纪念。
    一天上午，有位越南同志连着来了几位朋友，服务员一次又一次地给摆椅子、端茶、送毛巾，殷勤地招待着客人。当越南同志把客人送上电梯回来，在短短的两分钟里，服务员已经把房间收拾得十分整洁。这位越南外宾惊讶地说：“我们越南人打美国飞机算得上是神出鬼没，你们的服务工作真也做得神出鬼没了！”
    紧张的演出开始了。服务员们知道越南朋友一定很累，他们算着外宾快要回来了，就先开了房门，下了窗帘，开了灯，揭去了床罩，让越南朋友吃过中饭，很快有一个美好的午休。越南朋友感动地说：“你们的招待工作简直做到我们心里去了。”
    歌舞团的同志们回国之前，把服务员们请到房间里，热情地为他们演唱中越革命歌曲，留下了一封封热情洋溢的感谢信。越南歌舞团团长范庭六同志说：“……只有那些亲如骨肉、同甘共苦、生死与共的兄弟，才能对我们有这种热爱和关怀的感情。……让我们在打败美帝国主义的时候相会吧！到那个时候，我们要在这里住更长的时间，要以我们的表演为中国人民服务。要和你们联欢，以庆祝我们共同的胜利！”
    咱们是社会主义的服务员
    一些来自资本主义世界的客人，看到中国服务员工作做得那样热情周到，往往拿出一些小费或礼品送给服务员。所以，在“小费”问题上常常会发生一些有趣的“波折”。
    去年十一月，周德纯到门口去迎接一位意大利客人，帮客人搬运两只大皮箱。那位外宾第一句话就问：“提这两件行李要多少钱？”周德纯说：“咱们是不收小费的。”外宾又问：“是你一个人不收小费，还是你们整个国家都不收小费？”他回答：“不光新侨饭店不要小费，其他地方也不要小费。”这位外宾耸耸肩膀说：“不收小费的国家，我还是第一次碰到。”接着，他又问：“你们不要小费，生活能行吗？”周德纯放下行李，自豪地说：“我们每月有工资，有劳动保护，生了病还有公费医疗，我们的生活过得很好。”
    以后周德纯每给他送一回咖啡，外宾仍要给小费。有一次，当他把找下的一角五分零钱交给客人的时候，这位外宾连连摇手，把周德纯拿零钱的那只手推回去，要他把这些钱悄悄装进衣袋。这位年青的服务员微笑着说：“不，不，谢谢。”他把零钱放在茶几上，退出房间。
    这个外宾临走时，拍拍服务员的肩膀说：“我来中国两个星期，给你们钱和东西都不要，你们使我受到一次深刻的教育。中国人民的觉悟水平的确是高。”
    服务员们拣到外宾丢失的东西，总要千方百计找到失主。他们说：“即使丢失一双袜子也不是小事，这关系到咱们社会主义新中国的风尚。”有时客人离店了，他们就赶到火车站、飞机场把失物还给他；实在追不上了，也一定要把拣到的东西设法还给外宾。
    一天早晨五点多钟，服务员把一位意大利外宾送到楼下大厅。他想：“客人会不会拉下什么东西呢？”他飞速跑回四四五号房间。他先趴在床底下看了看，又把床铺翻了个遍，随后搬开沙发，又很快地把写字台、衣柜的抽屉全都打开。还好，什么东西也没有发现。当他转过身子打算出去的时候，猛然看到墙角里有一堆客人扔下的废品，他随便地扒了一下，在那堆垃圾里，竟然滚出一只青翠欲滴的翡翠别针来。这时，他什么也顾不得想，直朝楼下奔去。幸好那位外宾还在门口等车。当服务员气喘吁吁地托着别针出现在门口的时候，这位外宾一下把服务员给抱住了。他感激地说：“这是我最心爱的东西，怎么给拉下了！我非常感谢你，你们的工作做得太细致了。”
    “新侨”的服务员们就是这样高举着毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，全心全意为来自世界各地的外宾服务。每当一些外国朋友谈起中国服务员的工作，都这样说：“中国服务员的工作，体现了新中国社会主义制度的优越性。看来毛泽东思想在中国已经深入人心了。”
