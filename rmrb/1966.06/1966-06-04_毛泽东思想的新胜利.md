Today, our newspaper publishes two important pieces of news. One is the decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Committee. The new Municipal Committee will be led by Li Xuefeng, the First Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CPC, who will also serve as the First Secretary, with Wu De as the Second Secretary. The other is the decision by the newly reorganized Beijing Municipal Committee to remove all positions held by Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, to reorganize the Beijing University Party Committee, and to send a work team to lead the socialist cultural revolution at the university, acting on behalf of the Party Committee.

After these two pieces of news were broadcast at 4 PM yesterday, they immediately received strong support from the workers, peasants, and various organizations and military units in Beijing. The broad masses are jubilant and unanimously believe that the decisions made by the Central Committee of the CPC and the newly reorganized Beijing Municipal Committee are extremely wise and correct. This is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The previous leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee was permeated with a counter-revolutionary line against the Party and socialism.

Some of the main leaders of the previous Beijing Municipal Committee were not Marxists but revisionists.

During the socialist cultural revolution, the "Three Family Village" counter-revolutionary clique against the Party and socialism was exposed. The root of this counter-revolutionary clique is the previous Beijing Municipal Committee.

For a considerable period, the "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" became tools for the counter-revolutionary clique to spread revisionist poison and attempt to restore capitalism. Their root is the previous Beijing Municipal Committee.

For a considerable period, many departments of the Party and government in Beijing did not implement the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought line of the Party Central Committee but implemented the revisionist line; they were not tools for the proletariat to dictate over the bourgeoisie but tools for the bourgeoisie to dictate over the proletariat. Their root is the previous Beijing Municipal Committee.

In the field of education, the previous Beijing Municipal Committee also implemented a counter-revolutionary line against the Party and socialism. Beijing University was one of the most stubborn fortresses under their control. As exposed by the broad student body of Beijing University, their educational policy was not to cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause but to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie.

For a long time, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary cadres and revolutionary intellectuals in Beijing, have resisted and struggled against the counter-revolutionary line against the Party and socialism of the previous Beijing Municipal Committee. They have firmly followed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, done a lot of work, and made their own contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the Beijing area, more than 95% of the people and more than 95% of the cadres support Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Those who were temporarily deceived, once they understood the true facts, immediately took action and joined the battle against the counter-revolutionary line against the Party and socialism of the previous Beijing Municipal Committee.

Now, Beijing University has seen a magnificent revolutionary situation. The big-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades fired the first shot. Once this poster was broadcast on the radio and published in the newspaper, the entire school was stirred, and there was a wave of excitement. The proletarian revolutionary faction was elated, and the leftist ranks rapidly expanded. Tens of thousands of big-character posters, like a barrage of fire, hit the heads of the counter-revolutionary elements against the Party and socialism. The active support of various universities in the capital greatly boosted the revolutionary prestige of the proletariat. The "royalists" were terrified and have already been completely isolated. Under the leadership of the work team sent by the new Municipal Committee, the broad students, staff, and teachers of Beijing University are resolutely settling accounts with and fighting against the counter-revolutionary crimes against the Party and socialism committed by Lu Ping and others.

These counter-revolutionary cliques against the Party and socialism seemed very ferocious. Under their control and blockade, neither water nor needles could get in. However, once Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the great call for the proletarian cultural revolution and the masses rose up, their counter-revolutionary faces were quickly exposed. Like all reactionaries, they are nothing but paper tigers.

Our country is in a great situation. The people of the entire country have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated people's hearts, the political awareness of the broad masses has reached an unprecedented height, and the socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great successes. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, who opposes Mao Zedong Thought, who opposes the Party Central Committee, who opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and who opposes the socialist system, no matter who they are, no matter how high their position or how long their tenure, must be condemned by the entire Party and the entire country. The result they will get is only ruin and disgrace.

We firmly believe that under the leadership of the newly reorganized Beijing Municipal Committee, the erroneous line of the previous Beijing Municipal Committee and its influence will definitely be thoroughly eliminated. The proletarian cultural revolution in Beijing will definitely achieve great victories. All the work in Beijing will definitely be done well.

### 毛泽东思想的新胜利

专栏：社论

    毛泽东思想的新胜利
    本报今天发表了两条重要消息。一条是中共中央决定改组北京市委，新市委由中共中央华北局第一书记李雪峰同志兼任第一书记，吴德同志任第二书记。一条是新改组的北京市委决定撤销陆平、彭珮云的一切职务，改组北京大学党委，派出了工作组，到该校领导社会主义文化大革命，并代行党委职权。
    这两条消息，在昨天下午四时广播以后，立即得到了北京市广大工人农民群众和各机关、院校、群众团体和驻军的热烈拥护。广大群众欢欣鼓舞，一致认为，中共中央的决定和新改组的北京市委的决定，是非常英明、非常正确的。这是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    前北京市委的领导，贯穿着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。
    前北京市委的一些主要负责人，并不是马克思主义者，而是修正主义者。
    在社会主义文化大革命中，揭露了“三家村”反党反社会主义的反革命集团。这个反革命集团的根子，就是前北京市委。
    《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》，在相当长的时间内，成了反革命集团散布修正主义毒素、妄图实现资本主义复辟的工具。它们的根子，就是前北京市委。
    北京市的党、政机关许多部门，在相当长的时间内，不是执行党中央的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的路线，而是执行修正主义的路线；不是无产阶级对资产阶级专政的工具，而是资产阶级对无产阶级专政的工具。它们的根子，就是前北京市委。
    前北京市委，在教育方面，也是推行的反党反社会主义的路线。北京大学就是它们控制下的一个最顽固的堡垒。正如北京大学广大学生所揭发的，他们的教育方针，不是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，而是培养资产阶级接班人。
    北京市的广大工农兵群众、广大革命干部和广大革命知识分子，长期以来，对前北京市委反党反社会主义的黑线，进行了抵制和斗争。他们坚决按照党中央和毛主席的指示，做了很多工作，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业做出了自己的贡献。在北京市地区的百分之九十五以上的人民和百分之九十五以上的干部，都是拥护毛主席的，拥护党中央的。一时受了蒙蔽的人，一旦了解了事实的真相，就立即行动起来，投入反对前北京市委反党反社会主义黑线的战斗。
    现在，北京大学已经出现了一个轰轰烈烈的革命形势。聂元梓等七同志的大字报，打响了第一炮。这张大字报在电台上一广播，在报纸上一发表，全校人心激动，一片欢腾。无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气，左派队伍迅速扩大。千万张大字报，象排炮一样，打在反党反社会主义分子的头上。首都各院校的积极支持，大壮无产阶级的革命声威。“保皇党”吓破了胆，他们已经陷于完全孤立的地位。北京大学的广大学生、职工、教员，在新市委派出的工作组的领导下，正在对陆平等反党反社会主义的罪行，进行坚决的清算和斗争。
    这些反党反社会主义的反革命集团，看样子很凶。在他们的控制和封锁下，水也泼不进，针也插不进。但是，当毛主席和党中央发出了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大号召，群众起来之后，他们的反革命面目就很快被揭穿了。他们和一切反动派一样，也不过是纸老虎。
    我们的国家是一片大好形势。全国人民对毛主席和党中央无限热爱，毛泽东思想深入人心，广大群众的政治觉悟空前提高，社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得了巨大成就。谁要反对毛主席，谁要反对毛泽东思想，谁要反对党中央，谁要反对无产阶级专政，谁要反对社会主义制度，不管他是什么人，不管他职位多么高，资格多么老，都要全党共诛之，全国共讨之。他们得到的结果，只能是身败名裂。
    我们坚信，在新改组的北京市委的领导下，前北京市委的错误路线和它的影响，一定能够被彻底肃清。北京市的无产阶级文化大革命，一定能够取得伟大胜利。北京市的各项工作，一定能够做好。
