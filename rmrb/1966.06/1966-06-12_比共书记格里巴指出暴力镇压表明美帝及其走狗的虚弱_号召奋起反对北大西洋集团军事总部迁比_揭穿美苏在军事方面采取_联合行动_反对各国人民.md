    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 10th. Jacques Grippa, Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party, wrote an editorial for the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "People's Voice" regarding NATO's decision to move its military headquarters to Belgium. The title of the editorial is: "Drive NATO and U.S. Fascists Out of Our Country!"

    The editorial points out that the Belgian ruling clique's agreement to house the NATO military headquarters, an aggressive tool of U.S. imperialism, which was forced to move out of France, is "another shameless step in its act of treason."

    The editorial then emphasizes: "The Khrushchevite party also participates in this lackey group, advocating the so-called 'European Security Treaty,' which is a partnership between NATO and the Warsaw Pact Organization, in other words, 'joint military action' by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The open speeches of members of the NATO Ministerial Council also fully expose the collusion we have long exposed, namely: U.S.-Soviet collusion against the people of all countries."

    The editorial says: "The Belgian big financial groups and all the accomplices of U.S. imperialism are fearful. They fear the people of Wallonia and Flanders, and the working people of Brussels, who are unwilling to be enslaved by U.S. imperialism, and... are showing an increasingly high fighting spirit. They fear the people's resounding calls of 'Drive out NATO!' 'National Independence!'"

    The editorial says: "They are afraid because, due to the struggles of the people of all countries and the contradictions among the imperialists, NATO has fallen into crisis, and NATO has been fundamentally shaken.

    "They are uneasy because their 'protector,' the United States, is going too far and is becoming increasingly ferocious, causing even its allies and lackeys to suffer, as the current developments in the Congo show.

    "They are uneasy because their master, U.S. imperialism, has reached a dead end and is becoming increasingly isolated, suffering increasingly heavy blows from the people of all countries; the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, which has inflicted one defeat after another on U.S. imperialism, shows that U.S. imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. They are already in a state of constant anxiety."

    The editorial points out that because it is becoming increasingly difficult for Belgium's traitorous parties to deceive the people, they have torn off their "democratic" mask and are intensifying the use of reactionary violence to suppress the people. This shows that with the U.S. occupation of Belgium, the government is intensifying its fascization. The editorial emphasizes: "This precisely demonstrates the weakness of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, rather than showing their strength."

    The editorial concludes: "Nothing can intimidate the Communists, the anti-imperialists, and the masses of the people, and nothing can stop the development of the struggle for national independence.
    Suppression can only further arouse the people's hatred for the American occupiers and their accomplices, and hatred for the state machine of the suppressors."

    The editorial calls on the Belgian people to continue to struggle unceasingly until victory is achieved and NATO is driven out!

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 8th. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 8th, supporting the Belgian people's just struggle against the United States under the leadership of the Belgian Communist Party, and strongly condemning the Belgian authorities' fascist behavior in brutally suppressing the anti-U.S. demonstration by the people of Brussels on June 5th.

    The article condemns the bloody suppression and sabotage by the Belgian government authorities of the Belgian people's anti-U.S. struggle. The article points out that the fascist violence of the Belgian government authorities cannot suppress the will of the Belgian people to strive for and safeguard their national sovereignty and interests. Their fascist suppression of Comrade Grippa, the leader of the Belgian Communist Party, and other patriots, once again proves that the political and class struggles in Belgium are intensifying, and that the irreconcilable contradiction between the Belgian people and the anti-national and reactionary forces that sell out the national interests to U.S. imperialism is further deepening.

    The article says: "The political struggle currently taking place in Belgium shows that the Belgian Communist Party, as a Marxist-Leninist party, has become the true and only vanguard of the proletariat, and a loyal and unwavering defender of the national interests of the Belgian people. The Belgian Communist Party, led by Comrade Grippa, has set an inspiring and brilliant example for the communist and workers' movements in Western European countries with its unwavering revolutionary stance.

    The article says that the Albanian people and all Albanian communists fully and resolutely support the just and patriotic revolutionary struggle of the Belgian people under the leadership of the Belgian Communist Party.

    The article says, we believe that the Belgian people will surely achieve victory in the great and just struggle to defend freedom, national independence, sovereignty, and dignity.

    比共书记格里巴指出暴力镇压表明美帝及其走狗的虚弱
    号召奋起反对北大西洋集团军事总部迁比
    揭穿美苏在军事方面采取“联合行动”反对各国人民
    新华社布鲁塞尔十日电比利时共产党书记雅克·格里巴就北大西洋集团决定把它的军事总部迁到比利时一事，为比共机关报《人民之声报》撰写了一篇社论，社论的题目是：《把北大西洋公约组织和美国法西斯赶出我国！》
    社论指出，比利时统治集团同意把被迫迁出法国的北大西洋集团军事总部这一美帝国主义的侵略工具设在比利时，这是这个统治集团“在卖国的罪行中又恬不知耻地迈出了一步”。
    社论接着强调指出：“赫鲁晓夫分子的党，它也参加了这个走狗集团，鼓吹所谓‘欧洲安全条约’，也就是北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织的合伙，换句话说，就是美苏在军事方面采取‘联合行动’。北大西洋公约组织部长理事会成员的公开讲话也充分暴露了我们早已揭露过的勾当，即：美苏勾结反对各国人民。”
    社论说：“比利时大金融集团以及美帝国主义的所有帮凶都心存畏惧。他们害怕瓦隆和弗兰德的人民以及布鲁塞尔的劳动人民，人民不愿受美帝国主义的奴役，并且……表现了日益高涨的战斗精神。他们害怕人民同声发出的‘赶走北大西洋公约组织！’‘民族独立’！的激昂呼声。”
    社论说：“他们所以害怕，那是因为，由于各国人民的斗争和帝国主义之间的矛盾，北大西洋公约组织已经陷入危机，北大西洋公约组织已经从根本上动摇。
    “他们所以惶惶不安，那是因为他们的‘保护人’美国得寸进尺，穷凶极恶，连它的盟友和走狗都遭殃，正如目前刚果的事态发展所表明的那样。
    “他们所以惶惶不安，是因为他们的主子美帝国主义已经走投无路并且越来越孤立，正遭到各国人民越来越沉重的打击；使美帝国主义遭到一个又一个的失败的越南人民的英勇斗争表明，美帝国主义不过是泥足巨人。他们已经惶惶不可终日了。”
    社论指出，因为比利时的卖国政党要欺骗人民已经越来越困难，所以就撕下了“民主”的假面具，加紧使用反动暴力镇压人民。这表明，随着美国对比利时的占领，政府正在加紧法西斯化。社论强调指出：“这恰恰表明了美帝国主义及其走狗的虚弱，而不是表明他们有力量。”
    社论最后写道：“任何东西都吓不倒共产党人、反帝的人们以及人民群众，任何东西都阻挡不了争取民族独立斗争的发展。
    镇压只能更加激起人民痛恨美国占领者及其帮凶、痛恨镇压者的国家机器。”
    社论号召比利时人民继续不断地斗争，直到取得胜利，赶走北大西洋公约组织！
    据新华社地拉那八日电阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》八日发表编辑部文章，支持比利时人民在比利时共产党领导下进行的反美正义斗争，强烈谴责比利时当局疯狂镇压布鲁塞尔人民六月五日反美大示威的法西斯行为。
    文章谴责比利时政府当局对比利时人民这次反美斗争的血腥镇压和破坏。文章指出，比利时政府当局的法西斯暴力，镇压不了比利时人民争取和维护本国主权利益的意志。他们对比共领导人格里巴同志和其他爱国者的法西斯镇压再次证明，比利时的政治斗争和阶级斗争正在加剧，比利时人民同把国家利益出卖给美帝国主义的反民族的反动势力之间的不可调和的矛盾正在进一步加深。
    文章说：“目前在比利时发生的政治斗争表明，作为马克思列宁主义政党的比利时共产党，已经成为真正的和唯一的无产阶级先锋队，成为比利时人民民族利益忠实的和坚定不渝的保卫者。由格里巴同志领导的比利时共产党以自己坚定不渝的革命立场，对西欧各国共产主义运动和工人运动作出了令人鼓舞的光辉榜样。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚全体共产党人完全坚决支持在比共领导下的比利时人民的正义的和爱国的革命斗争。
    文章说，我们相信，比利时人民在保卫自由、民族独立、主权和尊严的伟大正义斗争中必将取得胜利。
