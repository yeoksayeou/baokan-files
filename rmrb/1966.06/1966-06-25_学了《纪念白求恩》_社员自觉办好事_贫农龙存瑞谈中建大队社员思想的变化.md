    According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: Long Cunrui, an illiterate poor peasant commune member of Zhuji Commune in Sui County, Hubei Province, has studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well. Not long ago, she gave a tutorial report on "In Memory of Norman Bethune" at the Sui County Hongshan District Mao Zedong Thought Study Instructor Training Class, which was warmly praised by the instructors.

    In her report, Long Cunrui talked about the tremendous changes in her and the team members' ideological outlook after studying Chairman Mao's works. She said: The commune members of our Zhongjian Brigade listen to Chairman Mao's words and study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other works by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's books are written for us suffering people, they guide us in making revolution. As long as we study, we will definitely understand; if we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will have inexhaustible strength and be able to do a good job in all revolutionary undertakings. Since we started studying Chairman Mao's works in Zhongjian Brigade, many good people and good deeds have emerged.

    Poor peasant commune member Li Xingxiu saw something glittering in the grass by the roadside. When she got closer, she realized it was a watch. She thought, how anxious the person who lost the watch must be, I must be as selfless and devoted to others as Bethune, and return the watch to its owner. After a while, the owner came looking along the road, and she happily returned the watch to him. Poor peasant commune member Chen Xuanfeng had an ectopic pregnancy and needed an operation, which required a blood transfusion. Commune member Zhu Xinghua volunteered to give her a blood transfusion. Some people said: Zhu Xinghua's health is not very good, let someone else give the transfusion. Zhu Xinghua said, "Bethune was a foreigner, but he gave blood transfusions to wounded Chinese soldiers. Chen Xuanfeng is from our team, a class sister, I should give her a blood transfusion even more, I must save her." Later, he insisted on giving his blood to his class sister. One snowy night, Tan Zhenghong, a poor peasant feeder in his fifties, felt a bit cold lying in bed. He immediately thought that he had bedding and covers and still felt cold, wouldn't the cows in the shed be even colder? He immediately got up, blocked every hole in the cowshed, and added bedding for the cows. Only after everything was taken care of did he go back to rest.

    She said: After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I am very enlightened. I am more enthusiastic about collective affairs than before, and I am more conscious of serving everyone. Once, our team was rushing to dig a well. Digging a well could not stop day or night, if it stopped, the underground water would seep out. I thought that digging a well was for everyone to have clear water to drink, and it was beneficial to the commune members, so I should take the lead. I brought my child to the work shed by the well. When he cried, I would come up to breastfeed him. When he didn't cry, I worked down the well, until 2:30 in the morning when I was relieved.

    Not long after, the Maozifan Street was digging a well, and urgently needed bricks to build the well. It requested our team to find a way to support. At this time, the bricks were still hot in the kiln, how could they be taken out? Thinking of Comrade Bethune's spirit of being selfless and devoted to others, they were not afraid of being burned. I took the lead in going to the kiln to get bricks, and many commune members followed me in. We were sweating profusely in the kiln, but everyone was not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and insisted on taking the bricks out of the kiln in time to support Maozifan Street.

    In the past, I always said that I was old, already the mother of several children, and could not learn. Thinking that Comrade Bethune was over fifty years old and came to China from afar to make revolution, I am only in my thirties, what does that mean to be old? I will never say I am old again. In the future, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do a good job in the revolution. In addition, in the past, when I saw others doing something wrong, I dared not speak up for fear of offending people. This is a big shortcoming and must be resolutely corrected in the future. There are always correct and wrong ideas in doing anything. As long as we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and like Comrade Bethune, be extremely responsible for our work and extremely enthusiastic for our comrades and the people, we can be a noble person. Chairman Mao taught us: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory." As long as we can make up our minds, do not care about personal gains and losses, and work wholeheartedly, what difficulties cannot be overcome?

    Long Cunrui finally hoped that class brothers and class sisters would learn Comrade Bethune's spirit of being selfless and devoted to others, wholeheartedly do a good job in revolutionary work, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has risen above vulgar tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people.

### 学了《纪念白求恩》  社员自觉办好事  贫农龙存瑞谈中建大队社员思想的变化

    学了《纪念白求恩》  社员自觉办好事
    贫农龙存瑞谈中建大队社员思想的变化
    据新华社武汉电  湖北省随县朱集公社一字不识的贫农社员龙存瑞，对毛主席的著作学得好用得好。不久以前她在随县洪山区学习毛主席著作辅导员训练班上作了一次《纪念白求恩》一文的辅导报告，受到了辅导员们的热烈称赞。
    龙存瑞在报告中，谈到她和队上社员学毛主席著作以后思想面貌发生巨大变化的情况。她说：我们中建大队的社员听毛主席的话，学习《纪念白求恩》和毛主席的其它著作。毛主席的书是给我们受苦人写的，是指导我们干革命的，只要我们学，一定学得懂；照着毛主席的指示办事，我们就有用不完的力量，就能办好一切革命事业。我们中建大队开始学习毛主席著作以来，出现了很多好人好事。
    贫农社员李兴秀看见路旁草里有个东西闪闪发光，走近一看，原来是一块手表。她想，别人丢了表该是多么着急，我一定要象白求恩那样毫不利己、专门利人，把表交给失主。过了一会，失主果然沿路找来了，她高高兴兴地把表交给了失主。贫农社员陈选凤子宫外孕，要动手术，需要输血。社员朱兴华就自告奋勇地给她输血。有的人说：朱兴华的身体也不大好，让别人输吧。朱兴华说：“白求恩是外国人，还给中国受伤战士输过血，陈选凤是本队人，是阶级姊妹，我更应该给她输血，一定要救活她。”后来，他坚持把自己的血输给了阶级姊妹。有个下雪天的晚上，五十多岁的贫农饲养员谭正洪，躺在床上觉得身上有点冷，他马上想到，自己有垫的有盖的，还觉得冷，牛棚里的牛不是更冷吗？他马上起床，把牛棚的每一个洞都堵好，还给牛加了垫草，一切料理妥当，才回去休息。
    她说：我自己学习了《纪念白求恩》，很开心窍，对集体的事比过去热心了，为大家办事比过去自觉了。有一次，我们队里在突击打井。打井是日夜不能停工的，要是停一下，地下的水就要浸出来。我想，打井是为了让大家吃上清亮的水，是对社员有益的事，就应该带头干。我把娃子带到井边工棚里，他哭时，我就上来喂奶，他不哭，我就在井下干活，一直干到深夜两点半才换班。
    不久以后，茅茨畈街上打井，急需用砖砌井，要求我们队里想办法支援。这时砖还在窑里热得烫手，怎么出呢？想到白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人的精神，就不怕烫了。我带头到窑里去出砖，很多社员也跟着我进去了。我们在窑里热得汗水直流，但是，大家都不怕苦，不怕累，坚持及时把砖从窑里取出来，支援茅茨畈街。
    过去我总是说自己老了，已经是几个孩子的人，没法学了。想到白求恩同志五十多岁了，不远万里来到中国干革命，我才三十几岁，算什么老？以后我再不说老的话了，今后一定好好地学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，好好地干革命。另外，过去我看到别人做得不对，因怕得罪人，就不敢说，这是个大缺点，今后要坚决改。办什么事总是有正确的思想和错误的思想，只要我们按照毛泽东思想去做，象白求恩同志那样，对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱，就能作一个高尚的人。毛主席教导我们：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”只要我们能下定决心，不计较个人得失，全心全意地工作，还有什么困难不能克服呢？
    龙存瑞最后希望阶级兄弟、阶级姊妹学习白求恩同志毫不利己、专门利人的精神，全心全意做好革命工作，要永远听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，做一个高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
