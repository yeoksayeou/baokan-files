    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council Decide
    to Reform College Entrance Examination Methods
    In order to thoroughly carry out the Great Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities and high schools, and to fully prepare for the implementation of new enrollment methods, it is decided to postpone the enrollment of new students to colleges and universities for half a year this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued a notice on June 13th. In order to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution and thoroughly reform the education system, it was decided to reform the college entrance examination methods and to postpone the enrollment of new students to colleges and universities in 1966 for half a year. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    In view of the current upsurge of the Great Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities and high schools, it will take time to make this movement deep and thorough. In many colleges and universities and middle schools, the bourgeois rule is still deeply rooted, and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is extremely sharp and intense. Carrying out the Cultural Revolution deeply and thoroughly in colleges and universities and high schools will have a profound impact on future school education. At the same time, although the college entrance examination methods have been continuously improved since liberation, they have basically not jumped out of the framework of the bourgeois examination system, which is not conducive to implementing the education policy put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and is not conducive to absorbing more worker-peasant-soldier revolutionary youths into colleges and universities. This examination system must be thoroughly reformed. This also requires a certain amount of time to study and formulate new enrollment methods.
    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council, considering the above-mentioned situation, have decided to postpone the enrollment of new students to colleges and universities in 1966 for half a year. On the one hand, this will allow colleges and universities and high schools sufficient time to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, it will allow sufficient time to make all preparations for the implementation of new enrollment methods.
    In order not to affect the enrollment of new students in senior high schools and the start of the new school year, graduating senior high school students whose school's Cultural Revolution movement has not yet ended can be properly arranged by the school for time and accommodation to continue to deepen and thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution movement; when the Cultural Revolution movement in their school has ended, but colleges and universities have not yet enrolled students, the school can organize them to go to the countryside and factories to participate in production labor.

    中共中央和国务院决定
    改革高等学校招考办法
    为了彻底搞好大专学校和高中的文化大革命，为了充分准备实行新的招生办法，决定将今年高等学校招收新生工作推迟半年
    新华社十七日讯　中共中央、国务院六月十三日发出通知，为了彻底搞好文化革命、彻底改革教育制度，决定改革高等学校招生考试办法，并且决定将一九六六年高等学校招收新生工作推迟半年进行。通知全文如下：
    鉴于目前大专学校和高中的文化大革命正在兴起，要把这一运动搞深搞透，没有一定的时间是不行的。有不少大专学校和中学，资产阶级的统治还根深蒂固，无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争十分尖锐激烈。在大专学校和高中，把文化革命运动搞深搞透，将对今后学校教育产生极为深远的影响。同时，高等学校招生考试办法，解放以来虽然不断地有所改进，但是基本上没有跳出资产阶级考试制度的框框，不利于贯彻执行党中央和毛主席提出的教育方针，不利于更多地吸收工农兵革命青年进入高等学校。这种考试制度，必须彻底改革。这样也需要有一定的时间来研究和制定新的招生办法。
    中共中央和国务院考虑到上述情况，决定一九六六年高等学校招收新生的工作推迟半年进行，一方面，使高等学校和高中有足够的时间彻底搞好文化革命，另方面使实行新的招生办法有充分的时间作好一切准备。
    为了不影响高级中学接收新生和新学年开学，高中的应届毕业生，凡本校的文化革命运动尚未结束的，可以由学校妥善安排时间和住地，继续把文化革命运动搞深搞透；在本校文化革命运动已结束，而高等学校尚未招生时，可以由学校组织他们下乡下厂参加生产劳动。
