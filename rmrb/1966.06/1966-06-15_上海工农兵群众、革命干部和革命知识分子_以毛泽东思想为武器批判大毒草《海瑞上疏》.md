    Shanghai News Agency, June 14th -- The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have recently held a series of symposiums and published articles to criticize the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial." They solemnly pointed out: No matter what kind of "backers" the Zhou Xinfang gang has, and no matter what tricks they play, we must shatter their anti-Party and anti-socialist plots and drag all the demons and monsters into the light of day for public display!

    With boundless indignation, the broad masses pointed out: "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial," like "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," is a poisonous product bred from the right-leaning opportunist political line; one in the south, one in the north, singing in harmony, with consistent counter-revolutionary methods and the same counter-revolutionary goals. They believe that the emergence of the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the New China in 1959, and its re-performance in Beijing at the end of 1961, was by no means accidental. It "pretends to be a congratulatory memorial but harbors a murderous anti-Party intent," is the opening drumbeat for right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party and plot a restoration, and is a wild cry echoing the anti-China chorus of American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Many workers wrote in their articles: Zhou Xinfang and others gnashing their teeth and cursing furiously are merely their means, while seizing power is their ultimate goal. Demons and monsters cannot wait to see the world change, vainly attempting to ride on the backs of the working people again. "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" precisely represents the demands of this small handful of demons and monsters. The so-called "speaking out for justice" is speaking out for the "justice" of reaction and acting on the "words" of restoration!

    Cui Weiqi, a worker at Liangyi Paper Products Factory, Zheng Chuhua, a worker at Shanghai Smelting Plant, and others warned Zhou Xinfang and all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements: You are directing the spearhead of attack directly at our great Party, great leader, great country, and great people, and our working class will not forgive you first! Wu Zhaofen and Xu Peijun, playwrights at the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe, said: Zhou Xinfang and others are rampantly hurling venomous language at our beloved leader and the Party Central Committee, and are completely in the same gang as the "Three-Family Village" black gang! You arrogantly say, "Ha ha! Even the master died young, how can the disciple live forever?" People with discerning eyes can see through these dark words at a glance. This was after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, when you saw that your international ally Khrushchev had already frantically opposed Stalin and betrayed Marxism-Leninism, so you became elated and thought the time for your stirring was ripe. However, the wings of a few flies can never cover the light of the sun; a few mad dogs may bark at the sun as much as they like, but the sun still hangs high in the sky.

    Tao Youzhi of the Tongxing Industrial Cooperative Weaving Factory, Ding Saijun of the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe, and others said: The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique once viciously cursed revolutionary cadres as "mantises" and "maggots crawling upwards," and rightists insulted revolutionary cadres as "yes-men" and "bridgeheads." Zhou Xinfang and others are precisely inheriting their mantle, using all kinds of malicious words to attack revolutionary cadres. Their purpose is to overthrow revolutionary cadres by cursing them, to sow discord between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses; to incite the masses to oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose the proletarian dictatorship, in order to pave the way for capitalist restoration. This is truly daydreaming! The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have long since opened their eyes and seen through your tricks.

    Qu Shaoguang, Xu Junwen, and others from a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison District pointed out: A small handful of class enemies always regard the proletarian dictatorship as a thorn in their side and a thorn in their flesh, slandering and undermining it in every possible way. Because the proletarian dictatorship binds their hands and feet, blocks their mouths, prevents them from speaking and acting recklessly, spreading poison at will, and creating chaos arbitrarily. They hate the proletarian dictatorship to the bone and openly want to "bring down" the proletariat, how arrogant, how狂妄! The revolutionary people do not practice "benevolent rule" towards landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and demons and monsters, but want to exercise dictatorship over them! The more the enemy curses us as "unjust," the more we must adhere to the revolutionary path! Anyone who dares to seize power will be crushed to pieces!

    The broad masses and cadres also used their personal experiences, presented facts, and reasoned to sternly refute the slanders of the Zhou Xinfang gang who vilified the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Mao Fengming, He Mingming, and Wei Yutian, commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison District, said at the symposium: Zhou Xinfang and others are talking nonsense, completely reversing black and white, and simply can't wait to curse the socialist state to collapse! They cited the fact that their hometowns had established people's communes and achieved a great leap in agricultural production, and unanimously pointed out: The vicious attacks by the Zhou Xinfang gang on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes are singing the same tune as the Khrushchev revisionists. However, the great socialist system has already taken root in the hearts of 700 million people, and the black hands of a small handful of people cannot cover the socialist clear sky!

    Bo Haikun and Yang Zhihong, workers at Hecheng Electrical Appliance Factory, Qin Dechao, a playwright at the Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe, and others further exposed the conspiracy of Zhou Xinfang and others to engage in "legal struggle" and promote "legal struggle." They pointed out: Zhou Xinfang, Tao Xiong, Xu Siyan and others placed their words and deeds on a "legal" footing everywhere. However, pretense cannot deceive people. Zhou Xinfang and others used "using the past to serve the present" as a cover, but in fact, they were engaged in the trick of "using the past to satirize the present," harboring ulterior motives. Zhou Xinfang and others used the entire scene of "Submitting the Memorial at the Risk of Death" in "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" to design a sample of "legal struggle," not only allowing Hai Rui to directly denounce the "emperor" and "scold him to his heart's content," but also scolding the "昏君" so much that he vomited blood and eventually died. Isn't this an attempt to have all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements launch a "legal struggle" face-to-face to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and subvert the proletarian dictatorship? Zhou Xinfang and others felt that this was not enough, and further arranged scenes of mass petitions and parades in the tenth scene, "Kneeling to Pray for Life," and the eleventh scene, "Escape from the Jaws of Death," inciting disgruntled people to rise up and fight the Party by means of petitions and parades. The extent of their rampancy can be described as unparalleled!

    At a symposium held by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association a few days ago, many drama workers stated: They are determined to work with workers, peasants, and soldiers to resolutely uproot the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial." They said: We will never allow Zhou Xinfang and others to use drama as a tool for their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, and we will never let go of any demons and monsters. Wang Lian, a playwright at the Shanghai People's Art Theatre, said: The like of Zhou Xinfang hate us for singing the praises of the Party and the people, and praising the virtues of socialism. They viciously cursed us as "singing the praises of the rabbit's achievements and praising the virtues of the Taoist priest," as "searching one's empty stomach" and "catering to the current dynasty," and "writing such boring things"; he used all kinds of malicious words to overthrow those who love the Party and love socialism. And they themselves desperately praised those right-leaning opportunists disguised as Hai Rui, nauseatingly praising them as "great saviors" who "relieved the suffering of the people for decades" and were worthy of "praise for thousands of years." Wang Lian said: Zhou Xinfang, Tao Xiong, and others vainly want to sing the "praises" of right-leaning opportunists and praise the "virtues" of capitalism and revisionism on the people's stage, our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers will never agree, our broad revolutionary cadres will never agree, and our broad revolutionary literary and art workers will never agree! Xiao Wenyan, an actress from the Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe, said: Zhou Xinfang, Tao Xiong, and others want to use vicious curses to seal the mouths of our revolutionary people, which is absolutely impossible! We must always sing the praises of the Party, we must sing aloud the praises of Chairman Mao, we must sing the praises of socialism and communism, and we must always be people's actors who sing the praises of the Party and socialism.

    All the young creative staff of the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe expressed great indignation at Zhou Xinfang, Tao Xiong, Xu Siyan and others' misappropriation of the name of "collective creation by the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe." They openly exposed this big scam in the newspapers. They pointed out: The anti-Party and anti-socialist big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" was painstakingly concocted by Zhou Xinfang, Tao Xiong, Xu Siyan and others. They determined the anti-Party and anti-socialist theme of the script and carefully arranged each scene and each important plot to serve this theme. Zhou Xinfang also personally wrote some of the most vicious anti-Party and anti-socialist lines, attacking the Party Central Committee as the "most violent emperor" with veiled criticism, and later changed it to "滥施淫威", "专横暴戾", and "寡恩薄义的暴君". In order to "scold to relieve his anger" and "scold to his heart's content," he disregarded historical facts and arranged the scene of "Submitting the Memorial at the Risk of Death," giving Hai Rui the opportunity to point his finger and scold "the current emperor" to his face. Zhou Xinfang feared that others would change the script and affect its "political effect," so he used his authority several times to order that no one was allowed to change the script. Someone made slight changes to individual words and sentences, which also caused his dissatisfaction, saying "You change yours, I'll perform mine." Tong Xiangling, Shen Jinbo, Sun Zhengyang, Sun Zhengqi and other actors from the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe revealed that in addition to brainstorming, setting the outline, and revising the lines in the process of creating the script for "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial," Zhou Xinfang also served as the director and played the leading role himself, in order to use these opportunities to carry out various malicious artistic designs. Bringing a huge coffin and an extremely large poisonous umbrella onto the stage were all designed by Zhou Xinfang alone, in order to vent his hatred for the proletarian dictatorship and entrust his delusion of changing the world. Tong Xiangling and Shen Jinbo also revealed that: When "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" was performed in Beijing, on one occasion, Zhou Xinfang forgot his lines, but he still scolded on stage. The lines he blurted out were even more malicious than the original lines. A small handful of people greatly appreciated this, and they praised Zhou Xinfang as a "living Hai Rui." From this incident, it just shows that the Hai Rui on the stage is actually Zhou Xinfang, and the lines of Hai Rui scolding the "emperor" are Zhou Xinfang's innermost thoughts of cursing the Party.

    Many comrades in the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe also solemnly pointed out: Now, the anti-Party and anti-socialist face of "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" has been exposed, and Zhou Xinfang and others are panicking, vainly trying to deny it and muddle through. However, the facts are there, the evidence is irrefutable, and you want to slip away and escape the guilt of being anti-Party and anti-socialist, a thousand times impossible, ten thousand times impossible! We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    以毛泽东思想为武器批判大毒草《海瑞上疏》
    严正指出，不管周信芳一伙有什么样的“靠山”，也不管他们耍弄什么样的花招，我们一定要粉碎他们的反党反社会主义的阴谋，把一切牛鬼蛇神统统揪到光天化日之下示众！
    新华社上海十四日电　上海广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，以毛泽东思想为武器，最近连续举行座谈会和发表文章，批判《海瑞上疏》这株大毒草。他们严正指出：不管周信芳一伙有什么样的“靠山”，也不管周信芳一伙耍弄什么样的花招，我们一定要粉碎他们的反党反社会主义的阴谋，把一切牛鬼蛇神统统揪到光天化日之下示众！
    广大群众怀着无比愤慨的心情指出：《海瑞上疏》和《海瑞骂皇帝》《海瑞罢官》一样，都是右倾机会主义政治路线孕育出来的毒胎；一南一北，一唱一和，反革命的手法一致，反革命的目的相同。他们认为，《海瑞上疏》这株大毒草出现于一九五九年新中国成立十周年的前夕，一九六一年底又到北京再次公演，绝不是偶然的。它“冒称贺表而进”，包藏反党杀心，是配合右倾机会主义分子向党进攻、阴谋复辟的开场锣鼓，是呼应美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派反华大合唱的一声狂叫。不少工人在文章中写道：周信芳等人咬牙切齿地破口大骂，不过是他们的手段，而夺取政权，才是他们的最终目的。牛鬼蛇神迫不及待地指望变天，妄图重新骑在劳动人民头上。《海瑞上疏》正是代表了这一小撮牛鬼蛇神的要求。所谓“仗义执言”，就是仗反动之“义”，执复辟之“言”！
    良益纸品厂工人崔维琪、上海冶炼厂工人郑楚华等警告周信芳和一切反党反社会主义分子：你们把进攻的矛头直接指向我们伟大的党，伟大的领袖，伟大的国家，伟大的人民，我们工人阶级首先不能饶恕你们！上海越剧院编剧吴兆芬、徐佩珺说：周信芳等人猖狂地把满口恶毒的语言，投向我们敬爱的领袖和党中央，跟“三家村”黑帮完全是一丘之貉！你们狂妄地说什么：“呵呵！师父尚且短命而死，徒弟焉能长生不老？”这些黑话，明眼人一眼就能看穿。这是在苏共二十大以后，你们看到了你们国际上的盟友赫鲁晓夫已经疯狂地反对了斯大林，背叛了马列主义，因此你们得意忘形，以为蠢动的时机已经到了。但是，几个苍蝇的翅膀永远不能遮住太阳的光辉；几条疯狗尽管使劲地对着太阳狂吠，太阳依旧高高地悬在天空。
    同兴实业社织造厂陶友之、上海越剧院丁赛君等说：胡风反革命集团曾经刻毒地咒骂革命干部是“螳螂”、“向上爬的蛆虫”，右派分子辱骂革命干部是“应声虫”、“桥头堡”。周信芳等人正是继承了他们的衣钵，用尽了恶毒的词句来攻击革命干部。他们的目的是想把革命干部骂倒，是想挑拨党群关系、干群关系；是想煽动群众反对党的领导，反对无产阶级专政，以便为资本主义复辟开道。这真是白日作梦！用毛泽东思想武装的革命人民早已擦亮眼睛，看穿了你们的鬼蜮伎俩。
    上海警备区某部曲韶光、许俊文等指出：一小撮阶级敌人，总是把无产阶级专政看成是他们的眼中钉，肉中刺，百般地诋毁和破坏。因为无产阶级专政捆住了他们的手脚，堵住了他们的嘴巴，使他们不能乱说乱动，随便放毒，任意捣乱。他们对无产阶级专政恨之入骨，明目张胆地要把无产阶级“拉下马”，何等嚣张，何等狂妄！革命人民对地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神，就是不施“仁政”，就是要专政！敌人越是骂我们“无道”，我们越要坚持革命之道！谁胆敢夺取印把子，定叫他粉身碎骨！
    广大群众和干部还用亲身的经历，摆事实，讲道理，严词驳斥周信芳一伙污蔑总路线、大跃进、人民公社的谰言。上海警备区某部指战员毛凤鸣、贺明明、卫雨田在座谈会上说：周信芳等一片胡言乱语，完全颠倒黑白，简直恨不得把社会主义江山骂垮！他们列举了自己家乡办起了人民公社，实现了农业生产大跃进的事实，一致指出：周信芳一伙恶毒攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，是同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者唱一个调子。但是，伟大的社会主义制度已经在七亿人民心中扎下了根，一小撮人的黑手遮不住社会主义万里晴空！
    和成电器厂工人薄海坤、杨志洪，上海市人民淮剧团编剧秦德超等，还进一步戳穿了周信芳等人进行“合法斗争”，鼓吹“合法斗争”的阴谋诡计。他们指出：周信芳、陶雄、许思言等人把自己言行处处放在一个“合法”的落脚点上。但是，伪装是骗不了人的。周信芳等人以“古为今用”作幌子，实际上干着“借古讽今”的勾当，怀着不可告人的目的。周信芳等用《海瑞上疏》中的“冒死上疏”一整场戏，设计了一个“合法斗争”的样本，不但让海瑞当面斥“君”，“骂了个痛快”，并且把“昏君”骂得口吐鲜血，终至死于非命。这不是企图要一切反党反社会主义分子，都面对面地展开“合法斗争”来反党反社会主义、颠覆无产阶级专政么？周信芳等人对此还感到意犹未尽，更在第十场“跪香请命”和第十一场“虎口余生”中，安排了群众请愿、游行的场面，煽动心怀不满的人用请命和游行的方式，起来跟党作斗争。其猖狂程度，真可谓到了无以复加的地步！
    在中国戏剧家协会上海分会日前举行的座谈会上，很多戏剧工作者表示：决心同工农兵一起，坚决把《海瑞上疏》这株大毒草连根拔掉。他们说：我们决不允许周信芳等人利用戏剧作为他们反党反社会主义的工具，我们决不放过一切牛鬼蛇神。上海人民艺术剧院编剧王炼说：周信芳之流恨透我们歌党和人民之功，颂社会主义之德。他们恶毒地咒骂我们是“歌兔子之功，颂道士之德”，是“搜枯肠”“迎合当朝”，“弄笔墨如此无聊”；他用尽了刻毒的词句，要把热爱党、热爱社会主义的“歌功颂德”派骂倒。而他们自己却拼命歌颂那化装为海瑞的右倾机会主义分子，令人作呕地称颂他们为“解除苍生数十年倒悬之苦”、值得“千秋称颂”的“大救星”。王炼说：周信芳、陶雄等妄想在人民的舞台上，歌右倾机会主义者之“功”，颂资本主义、修正主义之“德”，我们广大工农兵群众决不答应，我们广大的革命干部决不答应，我们广大革命文艺工作者也决不答应！上海市人民淮剧团演员筱文艳说：周信芳、陶雄等人想用恶毒的咒骂来封住我们革命人民之嘴，是绝对办不到的！我们就是要永远歌唱党，就是要放声歌颂毛主席，就是要歌唱社会主义和共产主义，就是要永远做一个为党为社会主义歌功颂德的人民演员。
    上海京剧院全体青年创作人员，对周信芳、陶雄、许思言等人盗用“上海京剧院集体创作”的名义，表示极大的愤慨。他们在报纸上公开揭穿了这个大骗局。他们指出：反党反社会主义的大毒草《海瑞上疏》，是周信芳、陶雄、许思言等人用尽心机炮制出来的。他们确定了剧本反党反社会主义的主题思想，精心安排了为这个主题思想服务的每一场戏，每一个重要情节。周信芳还亲自动手，写下一些最恶毒的反党反社会主义的台词，含沙射影地攻击党中央是“最最暴的君”，以后定稿时又改为“滥施淫威”、“专横暴戾”、“寡恩薄义的暴君”。为了“骂得解气”，“骂得痛快”，他更不顾史实，安排“冒死上疏”一场，让海瑞有机会指着鼻子当面毒骂“当今”。周信芳唯恐别人改动剧本，影响它的“政治效果”，就利用职权，几次下令，不准任何人改动剧本。有人在个别字句上稍作改动，也引起他的不满，表示“你改你的，我演我的”。上海京剧院演员童祥苓、沈金波、孙正阳、孙正琦等，揭露周信芳除了在创作《海瑞上疏》剧本过程中，出主意、定轮廓、改台词外，他还自任导演、自演主角，以便利用这些机会，进行种种恶毒的艺术设计，把一口特大的棺材和一顶硕大无比的大毒伞搬上舞台，都是周信芳一手设计出来的，借以泄发他对无产阶级专政的仇恨心情和寄托他的变天妄想。童祥苓和沈金波还揭露说：《海瑞上疏》在北京演出的时候，有一次，周信芳忘了台词，可是他照样在台上大骂了一通。他随口而出的台词，比原来的台词骂得更为刻毒。一小撮人对此大为赞赏，他们吹捧周信芳为“活海瑞”。从这件事上，正好说明了舞台上的海瑞实际上就是周信芳，海瑞骂“皇帝”的台词就是周信芳咒骂党的心里话。
    上海京剧院的许多同志还严正指出：现在，《海瑞上疏》的反党反社会主义的面目已被揭露出来了，周信芳等人慌了手脚，妄想抵赖，蒙混过关。可是，事实俱在，铁证如山，你们想滑过去，想逃脱反党反社会主义的罪责，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
