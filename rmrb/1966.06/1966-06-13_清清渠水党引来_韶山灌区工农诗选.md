    Clear Canal Water Led by the Party
    ——Selected Poems by Workers and Peasants from the Shaoshan Irrigation Area
    The completion and water supply of the first phase of the Shaoshan Irrigation Area project is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Party's General Line for socialist construction. In the construction of the Shaoshan Irrigation Area project, the vast number of laborers and cadres used sincere revolutionary feelings and heroic revolutionary spirit to write a large number of poems, enthusiastically praising the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically praising the magnificent construction of the Shaoshan Irrigation Area. Here are a few selected poems.
    Mao Zedong's Writings Are Just Good
　　Xiangxiang Yutang Bajiang Lian　 Zou Songliang
    Mao Zedong's writings are just good,
    Every sentence is a treasure.
    We have high consciousness after reading them,
    Our position is firm and we stand firm.
    Chairman Mao's words have profound meaning,
    Study and apply them creatively to make revolution.
    Learn from Zhang Side,
    Serve the people wholeheartedly;
    Learn from Bethune,
    The good spirit of communism;
    Learn from Old Man Yu Gong,
    The greatest difficulties can be overcome.
    Chairman Mao's writings bring strength to the whole body,
    Build the channel well and cultivate good people.
    Chairman Mao's Writings Have Great Power
      Xiangtan Huashi　Su Qingshan
    Chairman Mao's writings have great power,
    Changing the world depends entirely on them.
    If we master Mao Zedong Thought,
    Thousands of mountains and rivers will listen to us.
    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Hold the Seal of Power
        Xiangxiang Chengguan Jinxing Lian Tang Qiaofu
    Water passes through the mountains according to people's wishes,
    Thousands of acres of fertile land are liberated;
    Who is in charge in the countryside now?
    The poor and lower-middle peasants hold the seal of power.
    Happiness Comes from Chairman Mao
        Xiangtan Rihua Lian　Zhang Yikun
    The irrigation area's water is flowing,
    Future generations will never worry again.
    Happiness comes from Chairman Mao,
    Remember the Party's kindness in our hearts.
    Heroes All Rely on the Party's Cultivation
        Ningxiang Huarouminglou Zhoulongbiao　Yang Wenjin
    Ten thousand flowers rely on people to cultivate them,
    A thousand-mile-long river relies on people to open it up.
    One sentence must be remembered:
    Heroes all rely on the Party's cultivation.
    Keep Chairman Mao's Instructions in Mind
          Xiangxiang Chengguan　Wang Changsheng
    Keep Chairman Mao's instructions in mind,
    We can go to the sea and go to the sky,
    Overcome thousands upon thousands of difficulties,
    Hold the red flag high and advance forever!
