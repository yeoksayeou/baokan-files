	Brief Comments
	Still Not Resigned
	U.S. President Johnson said: The United States has repeatedly tried to move the war of aggression against Vietnam "from the battlefield to the negotiating table," but has not "received a satisfactory answer."
	Johnson's so-called "from the battlefield to the negotiating table" is nothing more than wanting to obtain at the negotiating table what the American aggressors cannot obtain on the battlefield. Therefore, how could the Vietnamese people give him a "satisfactory answer"? Johnson's "peace talk" schemes have long been exposed, yet he is still endlessly saying that "what the United States wants is negotiation, not war." This can only show that Johnson is still not resigned to his "peace talk" conspiracy.
	Cannot Come to Their Senses
	An Associated Press dispatch from Saigon on May 28 stated: "Although there have been no large-scale conflicts, American casualties in Vietnam were higher last week than in the past." This American news agency called this situation a "contradictory phenomenon."
	The scale of the battles is smaller than in the past, while the casualties of the American aggressors are greater than in the past. This clearly shows that the military and civilians of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and stronger in the war, and the American aggressors are becoming weaker and weaker in the war. There is no contradiction at all. Only those who refuse to admit this fact will be surprised. Such people will not come to their senses until they die.

    三言两语
    还不死心
    美国总统约翰逊说：美国曾多次设法使侵越战争“从战场上转到会议桌上”，但是没有“得到令人满意的答复”。
    约翰逊的所谓“从战场上转到会议桌上”，无非是想要在会议桌上取得美国侵略者在战场上不能取得的东西。因此，越南人民怎么能够给他以“令人满意的答复”呢？约翰逊的“和谈”骗局早已被人揭穿了，他却还在喋喋不休地说什么“美国所希望的是谈判而不是战争”。这只能说明，约翰逊对他的“和谈”阴谋还不死心罢了。
    清醒不了
    美联社五月二十八日从西贡发出一条消息说：“虽然没有发生大规模的冲突，但是上周在越南伤亡的美国人比过去多。”这家美国通讯社把这种情况称为“矛盾的现象。”
    战斗的规模比过去小，而美国侵略军的伤亡却比过去大，这很清楚地说明了，南越军民越战越强，美国侵略者越战越弱，一点也不矛盾。只有不肯承认这个事实的人，才会大惊小怪。这种人，至死也是不会清醒的。
