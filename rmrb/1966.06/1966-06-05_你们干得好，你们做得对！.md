    Beijing University comrades Nie Yuanzi and others, when we heard on the radio the news that you dared to struggle and dared to win in the Great Cultural Revolution movement, and were fighting against the "Three-Family Village" black gang elements Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun who were stubbornly resisting, we were very excited. All of us workers shouted to you: Comrades, you've done well, you're right! The more the reactionary black gang fears our big-character posters, the more we must post them, until they are completely overthrown and discredited. We workers firmly support you.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there still exist enemies without guns; they will inevitably wage a desperate struggle against us, and we must never underestimate these enemies." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, join hands, defend the great Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and completely crush all anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs!

    你们干得好，你们做得对！
    北京大学聂元梓等同志，当我们在广播里听到了你们在文化大革命运动中，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，向负隅顽抗的“三家村”黑帮分子宋硕、陆平、彭珮云进行斗争的消息，十分兴奋。我们全体工人向你们高呼：同志们，你们干得好，你们做得对。反动黑帮越害怕我们的大字报，我们就越要贴，一直贴到把他们斗垮、斗臭。我们工人坚决支持你们。
    毛主席教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”我们要牢牢地记住毛主席的教导，携起手来，为捍卫伟大的党、伟大的领袖毛主席，捍卫无产阶级专政，把一切反党反社会主义黑帮，统统打垮！
