    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Without the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communists as the mainstay of the Chinese people, the independence and liberation of China would be impossible, and the industrialization and modernization of China's agriculture would also be impossible.

    毛主席语录
    没有中国共产党的努力，没有中国共产党人做中国人民的中流砥柱，中国的独立和解放是不可能的，中国的工业化和农业近代化也是不可能的。
