    Arming People with Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Fundamental Issue
    Lessons from Fancun's Learning from Dazhai: In 1963, they learned from Dazhai, shouted for a year, and accomplished nothing; in 1964, they merely mechanically applied Dazhai's technical measures, the land remained the same, and the people remained the same; in 1965, they emphasized politics and learned from Dazhai, putting the human factor first, and armed people with Mao Zedong Thought, bringing about tremendous changes in the entire brigade.
    The Fancun Brigade of the Licao Commune in Huoxian, Shanxi, learned from Dazhai for three years. For the first two years, Fancun's production remained the same. In the last year—1965—tremendous changes took place in the entire brigade. In one year, 250 mu of dry land were transformed into irrigated land, and 290 mu of Dazhai-style high-standard farmland were constructed. The brigade's per-mu yield of ginned cotton was more than 105 jin, 15% higher than the highest per-mu yield in history; the per-mu grain yield also increased by 15% compared to the previous year.
    Why were the three years so different? Not long ago, the cadres and commune members of the entire team analyzed and summarized this. The conclusion was: the key lies in whether or not politics is emphasized, whether or not the human factor is put first, and whether or not people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Lessons of the First Two Years
    The Fancun Brigade began learning from Dazhai in 1963. That year, the brigade cadres' attitude was, "If the leadership tells us to learn, we will learn," and they read relevant documents introducing Dazhai's experience to the commune members, considering it learning from Dazhai. Soon, the Huoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed rural Party organizations to "carry out the activities of learning from Dazhai in a deep, solid, and sustained manner, and use the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai to transform heaven and earth." The Fancun Brigade changed to a new routine: they wrote a few slogans about learning from Dazhai on the blackboard newspaper at the entrance of the village, and wrote some of Dazhai's deeds on the slogan boards in the village. At first glance, the learning activities seemed to be going well. In reality, the commune members said, "Dazhai is good, but the hard work is unbearable!" The cadres also said, "We admit that Dazhai is good, but their people are united, and the commune members of Fancun don't listen to us and are difficult to lead. How can we learn from Dazhai?" After shouting for a year, nothing was accomplished.
    In the spring of 1964, in order to seriously carry out the activity of learning from Dazhai, the Fancun Brigade Party Branch decided to send Party Branch Secretary Xue Zhige, along with Team Leader Zhang Qiucheng, to see Dazhai with their own eyes. They went to Dazhai with sincerity, and there they asked Chen Yonggui to introduce Dazhai's experience, and also looked at Dazhai's land. They felt they had gained a lot. On the same night they returned to Fancun, Xue Zhige convened a meeting of Party members and cadres without resting, and introduced the situation of his visit to Dazhai to everyone. He said, "Only after seeing it with my own eyes did I grasp the true essence of Dazhai. If Fancun wants to turn over, it can only follow Dazhai's two experiences: one is to build Dazhai fields on a large scale; the other is to seize high-yield crops to overcome low-yield crops, plant more corn, and adopt the 'three deep cultivation methods' (deep plowing, deep planting, deep middle cultivation)." The Party members and cadres thought it was good and nodded in agreement. The next day, they convened a meeting of commune members, and Xue Zhige clearly announced that Fancun would learn from Dazhai's two experiences.
    Once the decision was made, they started working. In the spring of 1964, the Fancun Brigade followed this path. Who knew that things would go against people's wishes, and the commune members didn't believe in what Xue Zhige said. Some said, "We are begging for food with a golden bowl in our hands—six hundred mu of guaranteed irrigated land is enough, why build Dazhai fields!" Others said, "Not to mention the labor and effort, if you pad the land so thickly, the crops won't sprout, and you won't be able to harvest any grain, and you'll be drinking the northwest wind!" In the beginning, some people reluctantly went to build Dazhai fields, but who knew that after only a few days, the labor force building Dazhai fields dropped from the original 170 to more than 80.
    The commune members were unwilling to work, and the cadres were also angry, grumbling, "Good intentions are taken as donkey liver and lungs, the people of Fancun are born with poor bones, you ask them to learn from Dazhai and turn over, but they don't want to do it!"
    In this way, because ideological and political work was neglected, and people were not armed with a revolutionary spirit, only Dazhai's specific methods were mechanically applied, the land of the Fancun Brigade remained the same, and the people remained the same, even though they shouted about learning from Dazhai for another year.
    The Party Branch First Raises the Banner of Revolutionization
    The failure to learn from Dazhai for two years caused newly elected Brigade Party Branch Secretary Zhu Hongguang to think deeply.
    Zhu Hongguang was originally the Deputy Secretary of the Fancun Brigade Party Branch. He had been thinking about how Fancun could learn from Dazhai for a long time. When the learning from Dazhai failed again in 1964, he couldn't sit still anymore. That winter, he repeatedly asked himself: how did the Dazhai Party Branch lead the people of Dazhai? How do we lead the people of Fancun? He remembered what Chen Yonggui said: "When using people, you must know their nature; when planting land, you must know its nature. Leading production is the same as commanding a battle. If you don't know how to use a gun, don't understand military tactics, and don't understand the soldiers' thoughts, how can you win a battle!" Was Chen Yonggui's method innate? No, he learned it from Chairman Mao's works. If Fancun wants to follow the Dazhai path, it must emphasize politics like Dazhai, and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.
    After understanding this point, Zhu Hongguang began to consult Chairman Mao's works with the question of how to learn from Dazhai. He repeatedly read Mao Zedong's "On Practice", "Serve the People," and "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" and other articles. The more he read, the brighter his heart became.
    One evening, Zhu Hongguang ran to the home of poor peasant commune member An Shiguo after dinner and talked to An Shiguo about how to learn from Dazhai. An Shiguo said, "As the saying goes: 'The land is planted by people, and the play is sung by people.' Dazhai is good because the cadres of Dazhai are good, and the commune members of Dazhai are good. They have people like Jia Jincai and Song Liying. We lack these people!"
    The old poor peasant's words opened Zhu Hongguang's mind even more. He tossed and turned all night, unable to sleep, and repeatedly thought about the lessons of learning from Dazhai for the past two years. The more he thought, the more he felt that the commune members' criticisms were correct: for the past two years, learning from Dazhai had not produced any results, and we couldn't blame the masses, but only blame the Fancun Party Branch for not emphasizing politics like the Dazhai Party Branch, and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Fancun Party Branch did not use Mao Zedong Thought as the arrow to shoot the "target" of learning from Dazhai, did not use the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai to transform the Fancun Party Branch, transform the thinking of Party members and cadres, and did not use the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai to educate the commune members of Fancun.
    Zhu Hongguang understood from Chairman Mao's works that "the masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, and if we don't understand this, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." Therefore, he found a way to learn from Dazhai—emphasize politics, and use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the Party members, cadres, and commune members of Fancun. First, we must train a revolutionary team.
    Accepting the lessons of the past two years of seeing things but not people when learning from Dazhai, the Fancun Brigade Party Branch was determined to use Mao Zedong Thought and the determination and perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to cultivate the local Dazhai people.
    Sixteen Party members and thirty-six brigade and production team cadres from Fancun participated in the revolutionization meeting. They studied Chairman Mao's works and, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, examined their own thinking. At the Party member meeting, former Party Branch Secretary Xue Zhige examined his mistakes in complaining about the backwardness of the masses and not seeing his own backwardness in recent years. He said, "When learning from Dazhai, I was tough on the outside but soft on the inside, and I didn't understand how to learn it. When I ran into obstacles, I became discouraged and wanted to retreat. I am a half-hearted revolutionary." Party member and brigade accountant Cheng Xiuwen said, "The Party members in Dazhai can all be selfless and forget themselves for the public good, but what about me? I have too many private matters and only care about myself. How can I lead the commune members to learn from Dazhai?" At the cadre meeting, Zhang Qiucheng, the leader of the First Production Team, examined himself and said, "I visited Dazhai and heard people say that the Dazhai Party Branch attaches great importance to ideological and political work and attaches importance to doing people's work. We are not like this. All we know is to shout for work attendance all day long. Thinking about Chairman Mao's teachings and comparing them with the cadres of Dazhai, I am wrong in not doing people's work and wrong in not emphasizing politics." The meeting to resolve ideological revolutionization was held many times, and the sixteen Party members and thirty-six cadres of the brigade used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the cadres of Dazhai as a mirror to find not only the gaps in individuals but also the gaps in collective leadership.
    Arming All Commune Members with Mao Zedong Thought
    On the basis of the ideological revolutionization of Party members and cadres, the Fancun Brigade Party Branch guided the situation and vigorously grasped the ideological revolutionization of all commune members.
    The ideological revolution of the commune members of the Fancun Brigade began with studying Chairman Mao's relevant works and with class education. In those days, more than 190 male and female commune members of the entire team, whether in the fields, in the village, or at home, always seriously read and listened to Chairman Mao's books. In conjunction with learning, they carried out activities of recalling the bitterness of the past and thinking about the sweetness of the present. In this class education, many poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead in conducting self-examinations. In the old society, poor peasant commune member Zhang Haisuo's family of four could not eat a full meal for a year. His father worked as a farmhand for landlords for more than ten years. He was still wearing open-crotch pants when he herded sheep for others, but even this couldn't keep them from starving. Helplessly, his father endured the heartache and sold his mother to Qinyuan County. At that time, two-thirds of Fancun's thousand mu of land were occupied by landlords Zhang Weifan and rich peasant Yan Zhiheng; the fifty-seven poor and lower-middle peasant households in Fancun lived a tragic life of wives and children being separated and families being destroyed. Zhang Haisuo recalled the suffering of the past and said sadly, "Now, the Party has led us to turn over and become masters. The mountains are our mountains, and the land is our land. If we don't make up our minds to make revolution on our own land like the people of Dazhai, how can we be worthy of the Party and Chairman Mao!" Another poor peasant commune member, Fan Qibao, also said, "If it weren't for the Party leading us to turn over, I would still be working for the landlords and rich peasants. However, after turning over and eating my fill, I developed selfishness, and my heart was only focused on my small family. When the brigade called on us to learn from Dazhai and build Dazhai fields, I only worked for two days. The work was heavy and hard, so I didn't do it anymore. Thinking about it, I really lost face for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" Several returned educated youth also conducted self-examinations at the meeting to recall the past. They said that they would always remember the suffering of the past and transform themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and in labor.
    Tremendous Changes
    The Party branch raised the banner of revolution, and the masses followed. In the spring of 1965, when the Fancun Brigade Management Committee announced the plan to learn from Dazhai and build Dazhai fields to the commune members, everyone raised their hands and passed it. More than 170 laborers from the entire brigade were mobilized and, after a spring of hard work, renovated two old canals, and the expanded irrigated land and the completed Dazhai fields were several times greater than the achievements of learning from Dazhai in the past two years. In the past, there were two mu of good irrigated land on the edge of Fancun Village, which had been swallowed up by floods due to disrepair for many years and had become a sandy beach. Party member Zhang Haima felt very sorry and wanted to repair it. He said to the commune members, "Learning from Dazhai must start from the root. If we treat these few mu of sandy land well, we can protect the hundreds of mu of irrigated land by the river. Otherwise, the floods will wash away the land year after year, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, and over time, hundreds of mu of good land will be eaten up by the floods." The commune members said, "Okay, wherever you lead us, we will fight!" They immediately started construction and worked for dozens of days in a row. The commune members dug up the stones and filled them with soil, and finally turned the sandy beach into flat, good irrigated land again.
    Xiaogou, or Little Ditch, was a famous "rich gully" in Fancun, but the gully was too deep, and flash floods eroded it into gullies. In the past, someone had proposed renovating it, but most people were unwilling to do it at that time. They said, "The gullies are too deep and there is no way to treat them." This time, when they sincerely learned from Dazhai, people no longer looked at it that way. Poor peasant commune member Xue Laixi said, "The gullies occupy eight mu of land, and we harvest five or six thousand jin of grain less each year. If we don't treat it quickly, even more land will be damaged." Therefore, thirty or forty strong laborers entered the gully, repairing the edges, building dams, and filling the gullies, taking from the high places to pad the low places, and filling the pits. In a few days, the gullies were filled, and the land was leveled. People became even more convinced of the power of the Dazhai spirit. They built a large wooden sign, inserted it in Xiaogou, and wrote the seven large characters "Victory of the Dazhai Spirit" on the wooden sign.
    The people of Fancun said, "When we have Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and the Dazhai spirit in our hearts, we are not afraid of anything. No matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them." Once, when irrigating land in Zhongpogou, the water seeped very badly because the canal was newly built. The water leakage washed a hole in the canal bank. People watched the white water flow away in vain, and they couldn't irrigate the land, and they felt very sorry. At this time, commune member Fan Qibao jumped into the canal with a plop and used his body to block the leak so that people could rush to repair it. Qibao jumped into the water in a hurry, without taking off his clothes or shoes. The water in early spring was still very icy, and his upper teeth were chattering against his lower teeth, making a rattling sound as he stood in the water. Commune members Liu Baosheng and Yan Daixi saw that he couldn't hold on anymore, so they jumped into the water and replaced him. Qibao's shoes and socks were trapped in the bottom of the canal, but he took a breath after coming out and ran barefoot toward his home. As soon as he entered the gate, he took off his two door panels, carried them, and ran to Zhongpo Canal again. There were many thorns on the road, and his feet were pricked by the thorns and bled a lot. But he ignored these things, thinking only of quickly plugging the leak in the canal. The canal was finally blocked tightly, and 151 mu of land were fully irrigated.
    This year, emphasizing politics and learning from Dazhai, everyone's spiritual outlook was different. Of the sixteen Party members in the entire brigade, only four were five-good commune members in the past. Now, fifteen have become five-good commune members, and ten of them have been praised by the masses as "Dazhai-style leaders" of the Fancun Brigade.
    Among the commune members, advanced figures who were wholeheartedly for the revolution and for the collective also emerged in large numbers. In one year, more than sixty of their own "Dazhai people" emerged in the entire brigade, such as the "Red Family," the "Red Couple," "Iron Shoulders," and "Iron Girls."
    Now, the people of Fancun are continuing to move forward with great strides. Not long ago, when we visited here, this village of more than 120 households was quiet in the village and noisy in the fields. People were holding iron shovels and waving picks, building Dazhai fields with even higher standards on their own land. The people of Fancun are determined to overcome difficulties and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

### 用毛泽东思想武装人是最根本的问题

    用毛泽东思想武装人是最根本的问题
    范村学大寨的经验教训：一九六三年学大寨，喊了一年，啥事也没办成；一九六四年只是死搬硬套地推广大寨的技术措施，土地还是老样子，人也是老样子；一九六五年突出政治学大寨，把人的因素放在第一位，用毛泽东思想武装人，全大队发生了巨大变化。
    山西霍县李曹公社范村大队学大寨学了三年。前两年，范村的生产还是老样子。后一年——一九六五年，全大队发生了巨大的变化。一年中使二百五十亩旱地变成了水浇地，还建成了二百九十亩大寨式的高标准农田。全大队亩产皮棉一百零五斤多，比历史上最高亩产量高百分之十五；粮食亩产量也比上年增长一成半。
    为什么前后三年如此不同？前不久，全队干部、社员对此做了分析、总结。结论是：关键在于有没有突出政治，把人的因素放在第一位，用毛泽东思想武装人。
    前两年的教训
    范村大队是一九六三年开始学大寨的。这一年，大队干部的态度是“领导叫学咱就学”，把有关介绍大寨经验的文件向社员们念了念，就算学了大寨。不久，中共霍县县委指示农村各级党组织“要把学大寨的活动深入、扎实、持续地开展下去，用大寨人的革命精神改天换地。”范村大队又换了个新套套：在村头的黑板报上写了几条学大寨的标语，村里的标语牌上写了大寨的一些事迹，乍一看，学习活动搞得还不错。实际上，社员们却说：“大寨好是好，就是苦干受不了！”干部们也说：“大寨好咱承认，可人家人心齐，咱范村社员不听话，难领导，怎能学大寨？”喊了一年，啥事也没办成。
    一九六四年春天，范村大队党支部为了认真开展学大寨的活动，决定派党支部书记薛志戈领着一队队长张秋成到大寨亲眼看一看。他们是抱着真心去大寨的，到了那里请陈永贵介绍了大寨的经验，还看了大寨的土地。他们觉得收获很大。返回范村的当天晚上，薛志戈歇也没歇，就召开了党员、干部会议，把访问大寨的情况给大家介绍了一遍。他说，“这次亲眼看了，才摸到了大寨的真经。范村要翻身，只有照大寨的两条经验办事：一条是大搞大寨田；一条是抓高产作物卡低产作物，多种玉米，采用‘三深耕作法’（深翻地、深种、深中耕）。”党员、干部一听，觉得不错，也点头称是。第二天，他们召开了社员大会，薛志戈就明确宣布范村要学大寨两条经验。
    决定了就干起来。一九六四年春天，范村大队就沿着这条道路走。谁知事违人愿，薛志戈说的两条经验，社员不相信。有的说：“咱这是抱着金碗讨饭吃——有六百亩保证水浇地就够了，还修什么大寨田！”也有的说：“费工费劲不消说，把地垫上那么厚，种上庄稼不发苗，打不下粮食喝西北风呀！”开头还有一些人勉勉强强去修大寨田，谁知干了没几天，修大寨田的劳动力就由原来的一百七十个下降到八十多个。
    社员不愿干，干部也生气了，唠叨说：“好心当作驴肝肺，范村人生就的穷骨头，你叫他学大寨翻身，他还不干呢！”
    就这样，由于忽视了思想政治工作，没用革命精神武装人，只是死搬硬套地推广大寨的具体做法，结果，虽然又喊了一年学大寨，范村大队的土地却还是老样子，人也是老样子。
    党支部首先举起革命化的大旗
    学大寨两年没结果，引起了新当选的大队党支部书记朱宏光的深思。
    朱宏光原先是范村大队党支部副书记。他对范村如何学大寨已经想了很久。当一九六四年学大寨又一次失败后，他更坐不住了。这年冬天，他反复问自己：大寨党支部是怎样领导大寨人的？我们又是怎样领导范村人的？他想起了陈永贵说的话：“用人要知人性，种地要知地性。领导生产，和指挥作战一样，不会拿枪杆子，不懂得兵法，不了解战士的思想情况，怎能打胜仗！”陈永贵这套办法是天生的吗？不是，他是从毛主席著作中学来的。范村要走大寨之路，就一定要象大寨那样突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。
    想通了这一点，朱宏光就开始带着如何学大寨的问题向毛主席著作请教。他反复读了毛主席的《实践论》、《为人民服务》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》等文章。越读，他心里越亮了。
    一个夜晚，朱宏光吃过晚饭跑到贫农社员安士国家里，和安士国谈起该怎么学大寨的问题。安士国说：“俗话说：‘地在人种，戏在人唱。’大寨好，那是因为大寨干部好，大寨社员好，有什么贾进才呀，宋立英呀这些人，咱就缺这些人啊！”
    老贫农的这番话，更开了朱宏光的心窍。他一个通夜翻来复去睡不着，反复想两年来学大寨的教训，越想，越觉得社员批评的对：两年来，学大寨没学出成绩来，不能埋怨群众，只怨范村党支部没有象大寨党支部那样突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。范村党支部没有用毛泽东思想之矢射学大寨之“的”，没有用大寨的革命精神来改造范村党支部，改造党员、干部的思想，没有用大寨人的革命精神来教育范村的社员群众。
    朱宏光从毛主席著作中懂得了“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”于是，他找到了一条学大寨的路——突出政治，用毛泽东思想教育范村的党员、干部和社员，首先要训练出一支敢于革命的队伍来。
    接受两年学大寨见物不见人的教训，范村大队党支部决心用毛泽东思想，用愚公移山的决心和毅力培养当地的大寨人。
    范村的十六个党员、三十六个大队、生产队干部参加了革命化的会议。他们学习毛主席著作，根据毛主席的教导，检查自己的思想。在党员大会上，前任党支部书记薛志戈检查了这几年自己埋怨群众落后、看不到自己落后的错误。他说：“学大寨，自己嘴硬心软，到底咋个学法不摸底；碰了钉子，又灰心丧气，想打退堂鼓。我是半截子革命。”党员、大队会计成修文说：“大寨的党员都能够为公忘私，我呢？私事满多，光顾自己，怎么能领导社员学大寨？”在干部会上，第一生产队队长张秋成检查说：“咱去大寨参观过，听人家说：大寨党支部特别重视思想政治工作，重视做人的工作。我们可不这样，一天光知道喊出勤。想想毛主席的教导，比比大寨干部，自己错在不做人的工作上，错在不突出政治上。”解决思想革命化的会开了好多次，大队的十六个党员、三十六个干部，以毛泽东思想为武器，以大寨干部为镜子，既找到了个人的差距，又找了集体领导方面的差距。
    用毛泽东思想武装全体社员
    在党员、干部思想革命化的基础上，范村大队党支部又因势利导，大抓全体社员的思想革命化。
    范村大队的社员思想革命是以学习毛主席的有关著作，从阶级教育开始的。那些天，全队一百九十多个男女社员，无论是在地头田间，村边炕头，总是认真地读、听毛主席的书。结合学习，他们开展了忆苦思甜活动。在这一场阶级教育中，许多贫农下中农带头作了检查。贫农社员张海锁，在旧社会，全家四口人，一年吃不上一顿饱饭。父亲给地主当牛做马十几年。他还穿着开裆裤，就给人家放羊，就这也糊不住嘴。无奈，他父亲忍着心疼，把他母亲卖到沁源县。那时候，范村的一千亩土地有三分之二被地主张维藩、富农阎志恒霸占了；范村的五十七户贫农下中农过着妻离子散、家破人亡的悲惨生活。张海锁回忆了过去的苦，沉痛地说：“如今，党领导我们翻了身，做了主人，山是我们的山，地是我们的地，我们不下定决心，在自己的土地上象大寨人那样闹革命，怎么能对得起党和毛主席！”另一个贫农社员樊七保也说：“要不是党领导我们翻身，我还给地主富农扛活哩。可是，翻了身，吃了饱饭，就长了私心，心眼里只有小家庭，大队号召学大寨，修建大寨田，我只干了两天，活重活苦，就不干了。想起来，我真是给咱贫农下中农丢了脸！”几个回乡知识青年也在忆苦会上作了检查。他们表示今后一定永记过去的苦，用毛泽东思想改造自己，在劳动中改造自己。
    巨大的变化
    党支部扛起了革命大旗，群众跟着走。一九六五年的春天，范村大队管理委员会把学大寨建大寨田的规划向社员一宣布，大家一举手就通过了。全大队出动了一百七十多个劳动力，经过一个春天的奋战，整修了两条旧渠道，扩大的水浇地和建成的大寨田，比过去两年学大寨的成绩大几倍。过去，范村村边有二亩好水浇地，多年来由于失修，被洪水吞没了，变成了一片沙滩。党员张海马心疼的不行，想把它修起来。他跟社员们说：“学大寨就得从根子上入手，治好了这几亩沙地，河边的几百亩水浇地才能保住。不然，年年洪水冲，象蚕吃桑叶一样，日久天长，几百亩好地就要被洪水吃光了。”社员们说：“好，你领到哪里，我们打到哪里！”马上就动了工，一连干了几十天，社员们刨净石头填上土，终于把一片沙滩又变成了平平展展的好水浇地。
    小?沟，是范村有名的富圪洞，可就是沟太深，山洪暴发冲得沟沟壑壑。过去有人提议过把它整修一下，可那时多数人不愿意干。他们说：“沟深壑多没法治。”这次真心实意学大寨，人们不再那样看了。贫农社员薛来喜说：“沟壑占了八亩地，一年少打五六千斤粮食，不快治，冲坏的地更多。”于是，三四十个强壮劳动力进了沟，修边垒堰补壑子，取高垫低填坑子，没几天工夫壑补住了，地填平了，人们更加相信了大寨精神的威力，修了一个大木牌，插在小?沟，并在木牌上写了“大寨精神的胜利”七个大字。
    范村人说：“头脑里有了毛泽东思想，心里有了大寨精神，我们就天不怕，地不怕，再大的困难也能克服它。”一次，在中坡沟浇地，因为水渠是新修的，水渗漏得很厉害。漏水把渠堤冲了一个洞，人们看着白哗哗的水白流了，就是浇不着地，心疼的不行。这时候，社员樊七保，扑通跳进渠里，用身子堵住漏水处，以便于人们抢修。七保下水急，衣服鞋袜都没顾得脱，初春的水还很冰人，他上牙打着下牙，??发响，在水里挺着。社员刘保生、阎带喜看他已经支持不住了，就跳下水去，把他替上来。七保的鞋袜陷进了渠底，可他出来舒了一口气，就赤着脚往家里跑。一进大门，摘下自己的两块门板，扛着又往中坡渠跑。路上荆棘不少，他的脚被荆棘刺得流了不少血。可他不顾这些，想的只是要把渠道的漏洞快点堵住，仍然急跑。渠终于堵严了，一百五十一亩地浇了个饱。
    这一年，突出政治学大寨，大家的精神面貌不同了。全大队十六个党员过去只有四个是五好社员，现在有十五个成了五好社员，其中有十个党员被群众誉为范村大队的“大寨式的领头人”。
    在社员中，一心为革命、为集体的先进人物也大量涌现出来了。一年中，全大队出现了全家红、夫妻红、铁肩膀、铁姑娘等六十多个自己的“大寨人”。
    现在，范村人正在继续阔步前进。前不久，我们到这里访问时，这个一百二十多户人家的村庄，村里安安静静，田野里人声沸腾，人们举着铁锹，挥舞着?头，正在自己的土地上建设标准更高的大寨田。范村人决心要战胜困难，争取今年丰收。
