    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 19th: The Albanian newspapers *People's Voice* and *Unity* published editorials on the 19th, warmly welcoming the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai on its upcoming visit to Albania.

    *People's Voice*, in an editorial titled "A New Contribution to Albanian-Chinese Brotherly Friendship," pointed out that Comrade Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Albania is to further strengthen the brotherly friendly relations and the steel-strong revolutionary unity that have long been established between the people, parties, and countries of Albania and China.

    The editorial stated that a little over a month ago, the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu paid a historically significant visit to China. The Albanian delegation not only brought back great friendship from this visit but also gained the conviction that China has undergone and is undergoing profound revolutionary changes, and that the victories China has achieved in promoting socialist revolution and carrying out socialist construction have world-wide historical significance.

    The editorial pointed out that the Chinese people are a great and heroic people. The Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, is a revolutionary and glorious party that holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, successfully leads socialist construction, and stands at the forefront of the struggle against Khrushchev's modern revisionism.

    The editorial pointed out that the Cultural Revolution carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, their struggle to eliminate bourgeois and feudal ideology and to consolidate the position of proletarian ideology, is a great contribution of historical significance to the struggle for the complete victory of the socialist revolution and the complete elimination of revisionism and imperialism.

    The editorial, in discussing the current international situation, pointed out that the entire practical activity of the Soviet leading clique shows that they have completely degenerated into a group that betrays Marxism-Leninism and into accomplices of US imperialism.

    The constant task of true Marxist-Leninists and all true revolutionaries is to wage a persistent and principled struggle against modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party's leading clique, in order to politically and ideologically destroy this agent of imperialism. A resolute struggle against Khrushchev and Tito revisionism has now become the touchstone of all truly Marxist-Leninist parties and all truly revolutionaries, because the struggle against Khrushchev and Tito modern revisionism is the struggle for the complete and final victory of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause, the struggle against incorrigible traitors in the international communist movement, agents who undermine the revolutionary movement of the people of all countries, and running dogs of US imperialism.

    The editorial concluded by saying that this visit by the dear friends of great socialist China is a major event in our country's political life. We are deeply convinced that this visit will contribute to further strengthening the steel-like militant unity between our two peoples and parties built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and will contribute to the cause of our common struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism and the revolutionary cause.

    The editorial of *Unity* stated that the Albanian people receive Comrade Zhou Enlai as the great and noble envoy of the Chinese people, as one of the leaders of the glorious Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, as Comrade Mao Zedong's closest and most loyal comrade-in-arms, and as an old friend of the Albanian people.

    The editorial pointed out that the Albanian people are infinitely happy about the great victories that the great Chinese people have recently achieved in all aspects. The three great revolutionary movements – class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation – built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and the brilliant thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, now constitute the main characteristics of the great Chinese revolution, rapidly changing the backward face of old China, and are leading China to the highest peak of development and progress. The Chinese people are relying on these three great movements to carry out the socialist cultural revolution, determined to sweep away all reactionary things, sweep away all royalists, and sweep away bourgeois elements who attempt to obstruct the cultural revolution. This is another great contribution of the Chinese people to the great revolutionary cause of socialism and communism.

    The editorial said that the People's Republic of China pursues a persistent, clear, and revolutionary policy, and is gaining more and more friends and allies, becoming the mainstay of all revolutionary forces in the world. The people of all countries see that great China and Mao Zedong are the faithful defenders of their interests, the indomitable fighters for the great cause of freedom and national independence, and the indestructible revolutionary fortress. Our people are proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese people on the front line of the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism.” (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸说周总理的访问将加强阿中人民战斗友谊
    毛泽东的光辉学说引导中国走向发展的最高峰
    中国文化大革命是对共产主义事业的伟大贡献
    据新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》十九日分别发表社论，热烈欢迎由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团即将访问阿尔巴尼亚。
    《人民之声报》以《对阿中兄弟友谊的新贡献》为题发表社论指出，周恩来同志即将对阿尔巴尼亚的访问，是为了进一步加强阿中两国人民、两党和两国之间早已建立起来的亲如兄弟的友好关系和钢铁般坚强的革命的团结一致。
    社论说，一个多月以前，由穆·谢胡同志率领的我国党政代表团对中国进行了具有历史意义的访问。阿尔巴尼亚代表团从这次访问中不仅带回了伟大的友情，而且获得了如下的信念：中国已经进行了和正在进行着深刻的革命变革，中国在推进社会主义革命和进行社会主义建设方面所取得的胜利，具有世界范围的历史性重大意义。
    社论指出，中国人民是伟大的英雄的人民。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，是一个革命的、光荣的党，它高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，成功地领导社会主义建设，并且站在反对赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义的斗争的最前列。
    社论指出，中国人民在共产党和毛泽东主席领导下所进行的文化大革命，他们为清除资产阶级和封建意识形态以及为巩固无产阶级意识形态阵地而进行的斗争，是对为社会主义革命的彻底胜利和彻底消灭修正主义和帝国主义而进行的斗争的具有历史意义的伟大贡献。
    社论在谈到当前的国际形势时指出，苏联领导集团的全部实际活动表明，他们已经彻头彻尾地堕落成为一个背叛马克思列宁主义的集团，堕落成为美帝国主义的合伙者。
    真正的马克思列宁主义者和所有真正的革命者的经常任务，就是同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者进行坚持不懈的有原则的斗争，以便在政治上和思想上摧毁帝国主义的这个代理人。对赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义进行坚决的斗争，现在已成为所有真正马克思列宁主义政党和所有真正革命者的试金石，因为反对赫鲁晓夫和铁托现代修正主义的斗争，就是争取马克思列宁主义和革命事业的彻底和最后的胜利的斗争，就是对国际共产主义运动中不可救药的叛徒、对破坏世界各国人民革命运动的代理人，和对美帝国主义的走狗的斗争。
    社论最后说，伟大的社会主义中国的亲爱的朋友们的这次访问，是我国政治生活中的重大事件。我们深信，这次访问将对进一步加强建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的我们两国人民和两党之间的钢铁般的战斗的团结一致作出贡献，将对我们反对帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的共同斗争的事业和革命事业作出贡献。
    《团结报》的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民把周恩来同志当作中国人民的伟大的和崇高的使者，当作光荣的中国共产党和中华人民共和国的领导人之一，当作毛泽东主席的最亲密和最忠实的战友之一，当作阿尔巴尼亚人民的老朋友来接待。
    社论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大的中国人民最近在各方面所取得的伟大胜利感到无限的高兴。建立在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东同志的光辉学说基础之上的三大革命运动——阶级斗争，生产斗争和科学实验，现在构成了伟大中国革命的主要特点，迅速地改变着旧中国落后的面貌，正在把中国引向发展和进步的最高峰。中国人民正依靠这三个伟大的运动进行社会主义文化大革命，决心横扫一切反动的东西，横扫所有保皇党，横扫企图阻挡文化大革命的资产阶级分子。这是中国人民对社会主义和共产主义伟大革命事业的又一伟大贡献。
    社论说，中华人民共和国奉行坚持不懈的、明确的和革命的政策，正获得越来越多的朋友和同盟者，成为世界上一切革命力量的中流砥柱。各国人民看到，伟大的中国和毛泽东是他们的利益的忠实保卫者，是自由和民族独立伟大事业的不屈不挠的战士，是摧不毁的革命堡垒。我国人民为同伟大的中国人民并肩站在反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义斗争的第一线而感到自豪。”（附图片）
