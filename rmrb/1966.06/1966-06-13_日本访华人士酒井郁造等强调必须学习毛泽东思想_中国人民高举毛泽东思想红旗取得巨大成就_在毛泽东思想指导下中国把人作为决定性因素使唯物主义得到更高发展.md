    Xinhua News Agency Report: Sakai Ikuo, head of the Japanese Socialist Party Activists Delegation visiting China, and other members recently met with Xinhua News Agency reporters and warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction while holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Delegation leader Sakai Ikuo said that in China, under the difficult circumstances of the dual oppression of imperialism and feudalism, Chairman Mao very clearly analyzed the situation and put forward correct guidelines, and I admire this very much. Chairman Mao organized the center of the Chinese revolution—the Chinese Communist Party, and adopted the policies of the mass line and the united front, which also moved me very much. Mao Zedong Thought has been tempered in struggle. I deeply feel that in the future, while studying the theories of Marx and Lenin, we must study Mao Zedong Thought more.
    Sakai Ikuo said that during this visit, we personally saw the vivid situation of the Chinese people carrying out socialist construction under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adopting the principle of self-reliance. After returning home, we will convey this vivid situation to the Japanese people.
    Delegation member Nagano Harutoshi said that China's socialist construction is very successful. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China treats people as the decisive factor, enabling a higher development of materialism. This is an important factor in China's further development. I admire this very much. I have received so much education in China, which is the first time since I visited foreign countries.
    Nagano Harutoshi spoke enthusiastically about his profound impressions of visiting Chairman Mao's hometown of Shaoshan in Hunan Province and Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution. He said that after visiting Shaoshan, I realized that the Chinese revolution was centered on the countryside and combined the peasants with the workers. This approach moved me very much. After leading the Chinese Red Army to complete the 25,000-li Long March, Chairman Mao had a long-term vision and chose Yan'an, a place where the enemy's rule was weak, and finally defeated Japanese imperialism. This proves the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. This is what we must learn.
    Delegation member Onaka Kazumasa said that one thing I learned in China is that the Chinese people are studying Mao Zedong Thought in depth. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they are carrying out a resolute struggle against US imperialism and revisionism.
    Delegation member Fujiyoshi Shinichi said, I deeply feel that the real situation of China carrying out socialist construction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought must be accurately conveyed to the Japanese people. This is a great encouragement to the Japanese people's struggle against US military bases and against the Japan-US Security Treaty.
    These four Japanese friends also enthusiastically praised the militant friendship forged between the people of China and Japan in the struggle against US imperialism. Sakai Ikuo said that after returning home, he will work hard to oppose US imperialism, expand the Japan-China Friendship Association, and promote the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. Onaka Kazumasa pointed out that the common enemy of the people of Japan and China is US imperialism. The militant friendship between the two peoples will surely develop. (Photo attached)

    日本访华人士酒井郁造等强调必须学习毛泽东思想
    中国人民高举毛泽东思想红旗取得巨大成就
    在毛泽东思想指导下中国把人作为决定性因素使唯物主义得到更高发展
    新华社讯　正在我国访问的日本社会党活动家访华团团长酒井郁造和团员最近会见新华社记者时，热烈赞扬中国人民高举毛泽东思想红旗在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。
    酒井郁造团长说，在中国有帝国主义和封建主义双重压迫的困难情况下，毛主席非常明确地分析了形势，提出了正确方针，对这一点我非常钦佩。毛主席组织了中国革命的中心——中国共产党，采取了群众路线和统一战线的政策，这也使我非常感动。毛泽东思想是在斗争中得到锻炼的。我深感，我们今后在学习马克思和列宁的理论的同时，必须更多地学习毛泽东思想。
    酒井郁造说，在这次访问中，我们亲眼看到中国人民在毛泽东思想旗帜下，采取自力更生方针进行社会主义建设的生动情况。回国以后，我们要把这一生动情况传达给日本人民。
    代表团成员长野春利说，中国的社会主义建设是非常成功的。在毛泽东思想指导下，中国把人作为决定性因素，使唯物主义得到更高发展。这是中国进一步发展的重要因素。对这一点我非常佩服。我在中国受到这么大的教育，这是我出国访问以来的第一次。
    长野春利畅谈了他访问毛主席故乡湖南韶山和中国革命圣地延安的深刻印象。他说，参观了韶山，我认识到中国革命是以农村为中心，并使农民与工人相结合。这一做法使我很感动。毛主席领导中国红军完成二万五千里长征后，有远大的眼光，选择了延安这个敌人统治薄弱的地方，最后打败了日本帝国主义。这证明了毛泽东思想的正确性。这一点是我们必须学习的。
    代表团成员大中一正说，我在中国学习到的一点是，中国人民正在深入地学习毛泽东思想。他们正在毛泽东思想的指导下，对美帝国主义和修正主义进行坚决斗争。
    代表团成员藤吉信一说，我深感，中国正以毛泽东思想为指导进行社会主义建设的真实情况，必须正确地传达给日本人民，这对日本人民反对美国军事基地、反对日美安全条约的斗争是一个很大鼓舞。
    这四位日本朋友还热情颂扬中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义斗争中结成的战斗友谊。酒井郁造表示，回国后他将为反对美帝国主义、为扩大日中友协组织、促进恢复日中邦交而努力。大中一正指出，日中两国人民的共同敌人是美帝国主义。两国人民的战斗友谊必将发展下去。（附图片）
