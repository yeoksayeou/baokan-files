    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The 32nd session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) was held in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, from May 26 to 28. The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation attending the meeting told Xinhua reporters: The Chinese Trade Union delegation held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line of the international workers' movement, thoroughly exposed the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers' class capitulationist line of serving American imperialism at the meeting, and waged a sharp struggle against them.

    The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation said that at this meeting, the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers feigned support but truly betrayed the issue of Vietnam, cooperated with the "peace talks" conspiracy of American imperialism, and clamored for so-called "joint action." The Chinese Trade Union representatives exposed their lies with solid evidence. The Chinese Trade Union representatives pointed out in their speeches: The Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers had just raised their hands at the World Federation of Trade Unions' Sixth Congress to approve the resolution on supporting Vietnam, and a few hours later, they concocted another resolution that did not distinguish between aggression and anti-aggression, echoed American imperialism, and demanded the so-called "cessation of the Vietnam War." At the beginning of this year, just as Johnson launched his "peace offensive," they used the WFTU publications to actively promote a "ceasefire" in Vietnam, while ignoring the appeals of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions for world public opinion to expose Johnson's deception. The Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers also tried to erase the content of the two Hanoi meetings of the "International Workers' Committee for Supporting the Vietnamese Workers and People Against American Imperialist Aggression" that firmly opposed American imperialism, and tried every possible means to cancel and tamper with the name of the International Trade Union Support Vietnam Conference, including the content of "opposing American imperialist aggression," and also vigorously advocated sending trade union delegations to the United States to discuss "joint action" on the Vietnam issue with the AFL-CIO, which fully supported Johnson's policy of aggression against Vietnam. All this shows that the "unity" they are clamoring for is to unite with American imperialism, which vividly proves that the Soviet revisionist clique has completely degenerated into traitors to the working class and accomplices of American imperialism.

    The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation said that at this meeting, the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers emphasized highlighting so-called "trade union issues" in the activities of the WFTU. They attacked the WFTU meetings for discussing major political issues. They babbled that the main form of support for workers in Asia and Africa by the international trade union movement should be to help train trade union cadres and to cooperate with UN specialized agencies to carry out vocational training in these countries. Their fallacies were sternly refuted by many representatives. The Venezuelan trade union representative firmly refuted the absurd argument that trade unions have nothing to do with political struggle and questioned why the second agenda report defining the tasks of various industrial trade union internationals was more than fifty pages long, but did not even contain the words "oppose American imperialism." The Chinese Trade Union representatives pointed out that the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers had brought out the old goods that had long been bankrupt by old revisionists decades ago, the so-called "pure trade union struggle," the so-called trade union movement having nothing to do with revolutionary class struggle, the purpose of which was to obliterate the most acute class struggle of the time, to divert the struggle of oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and new and old colonialism, and to strangle the national liberation movement and undermine the revolutionary struggles of the working class and people of all countries. This is a class collaboration line that serves American imperialism, and it is also a line that colludes with the leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions who betray the interests of the working class. It is an important component of the "peaceful coexistence" general line imposed on the WFTU by the Soviet Trade Union leaders.

    The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation said that the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers also used this meeting to vigorously tout the so-called "economic reforms" promoted by the Soviet leadership group for the comprehensive restoration of capitalism and to praise the 23rd Congress of the CPSU. The Chinese Trade Union representatives solemnly pointed out at the meeting that the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers not only turned the WFTU into an echo chamber of the CPSU leadership group, but also wanted to turn the WFTU into an obligatory propagandist for American imperialism's policy of "peaceful evolution" toward socialist countries.

    The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation also revealed that the Soviet Trade Union leaders and their followers continued to engage in divisive activities against progressive trade unions in various countries and gloated over the progressive trade unions in Indonesia, which were being persecuted by the Indonesian right-wing fascists. Japanese trade union representatives revealed at the meeting that the WFTU used traitors to the Japanese Communist Party to grossly interfere in the internal affairs of the Japanese trade union movement.

    The head of the Chinese Trade Union delegation finally said that the Soviet Trade Union leaders also used the meeting to fabricate rumors and slanders against China, which resolutely opposes American imperialism. But no matter how they scold, the imperialists will be overthrown, and the victorious advance of the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries cannot be changed by any force. Modern revisionism, centered on the Soviet leadership group, as an accomplice of imperialism and a betrayer of the revolutionary cause, will certainly not have a good end. The struggle of the Chinese workers and the workers of the world against imperialism, monopoly capital, and reactionaries of all countries will sweep away all obstacles and achieve final victory.

    我出席世界工联执委会议代表团高举毛泽东思想红旗坚持革命路线
    痛斥苏联领导集团为美帝效劳的投降路线
    揭穿苏联工会领导人在越南问题上再次兜售“联合行动”的大骗局
    新华社十二日讯　世界工联执行委员会第三十二次会议于五月二十六日至二十八日在塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚举行。出席这次会议的中国工会代表团负责人对新华社记者发表谈话指出：中国工会代表团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持国际工人运动的反帝革命路线，在会议上彻底揭露了苏联工会领导人及其追随者的为美帝效劳的阶级投降路线，并同他们进行了尖锐的斗争。
    中国工会代表团负责人说，苏联工会领导人及其追随者，在这次会议上，对越南问题假支持、真出卖，配合美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋，大声叫嚷所谓“联合行动”。中国工会代表有根有据地揭穿了他们的谎言。中国工会代表的发言指出：苏联工会领导人及其追随者在世界工会“六大”上，刚刚举手赞成关于支援越南的决议，几个小时以后，就搞了另外一个决议，不分侵略和反侵略，同美帝国主义一唱一和，要求所谓“停止越南战争”。在今年初，正当约翰逊发动“和平攻势”的时候，他们又利用世界工联刊物，积极鼓吹越南“停火”，而对越南总工会和越南南方解放工会联合会要求世界舆论揭露约翰逊骗局的呼吁，却置之不理。苏联工会领导人及其追随者，还力图勾销“国际工人支援越南工人和人民反对美帝国主义侵略委员会”两次河内会议坚决反对美帝国主义的内容，千方百计地硬要取消和篡改国际工会支援越南会议的名称包括有“反对美帝国主义侵略”的内容，还大肆鼓吹派工会代表团去美国，同完全支持约翰逊侵越政策的美国劳联—产联商谈在越南问题上“联合行动”。所有这一切表明，他们所叫嚷的“联合”，是要联合美帝国主义，它活生生地证明，苏联修正主义集团已经完全堕落为工人阶级叛徒和美帝国主义帮凶。
    中国工会代表团负责人说，苏联工会领导人及其追随者，在这次会议上强调要在世界工联的活动中突出所谓“工会问题”。他们攻击世界工联的会议讨论重大政治问题。胡说国际工会运动对亚非各国工人的主要支援形式应当是帮助培养工会干部，配合联合国专门机构在这些国家开展职业训练。他们的这种谬论遭到许多代表的严词驳斥。委内瑞拉工会代表坚决驳斥了工会与政治斗争无关的荒谬论点，并且质问他们，为什么确定各产业工会国际任务的第二项议程报告长达五十余页，可是连一个“反对美帝国主义”的字样都没有。中国工会代表指出，苏联工会领导人及其追随者搬出了几十年前老修正主义者早已破产的旧货，所谓“纯粹工会斗争”、所谓工会运动同革命的阶级斗争无关，其目的在于抹杀当代最尖锐的阶级斗争，转移亚非拉地区被压迫的民族反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争矛头，扼杀民族解放运动，破坏各国工人阶级和人民的革命斗争。这是为美帝效劳的阶级合作路线，也是同背叛工人阶级利益的国际自由工联领导人同流合污的路线，它是苏联工会领导人强加给世界工联的“和平共处”总路线的重要组成部分。
    中国工会代表团负责人说，苏联工会领导人及其追随者，还利用这次会议，大肆吹嘘苏联领导集团为全面复辟资本主义而推行的所谓“经济改革”和吹捧苏共二十三大。中国工会代表在会议上就这一点严正指出，苏联工会领导人及其追随者不仅把世界工联变成了苏共领导集团的应声虫，而且要把世界工联变为美帝国主义向社会主义国家推行“和平演变”政策的义务宣传员。
    中国工会代表团负责人还揭露，苏联工会领导人及其追随者继续对各国进步工会大搞分裂活动，并对正在遭到印度尼西亚右派法西斯迫害的印度尼西亚进步工会，表示幸灾乐祸。日本工会代表在会议上揭露了世界工联利用日本共产党的叛徒，对日本工会运动内部事务进行粗暴干涉。
    中国工会代表团负责人最后说，苏联工会领导人还利用会议，对于坚决反对美帝国主义的中国，百般造谣中伤。但是不管他们如何辱骂，帝国主义要被打倒和各国人民革命斗争的胜利前进，是任何力量也改变不了的。以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，作为帝国主义的帮凶和革命事业的背叛者，肯定不会有好下场。中国工人和全世界工人反对帝国主义、垄断资本和各国反动派的斗争，必将扫除一切障碍，取得最后的胜利。
