Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government, on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai, and in his personal capacity, extended a warm welcome to Crown Prince Birendra Shah and other Nepalese guests.

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised Nepal for consistently pursuing a policy of peace, neutrality, and independence under the leadership of King Mahendra, making active contributions to the cause of Asian-African unity and anti-imperialism, and gaining increasing international prestige; praised the Nepalese people for defending national independence, maintaining national dignity, and achieving many successes in self-reliant national construction.

When talking about the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, Nepal is our friendly neighbor. China and Nepal have always been on good terms, and the two peoples have a thousand-year tradition of friendship. Now, our two countries' relations, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, are even closer and friendlier. We believe that this visit by Crown Prince Birendra Shah and other Nepalese guests to our country will further enhance mutual understanding between our two countries and promote the development of our friendship.

Crown Prince Birendra Shah said in his speech that the long-standing and time-tested relationship between Nepal and China has historical and traditional foundations. The peace and friendship between Nepal and China are realized on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Nepal-China Border Treaty we signed is an example of mutual concession, mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit between countries, and peaceful resolution of disputes.

He said that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the People's Republic of China has made great progress in the economy and other fields. The Kathmandu-Kodari Highway built with Chinese aid and the planned Bokhara-Kathmandu Highway will help develop the remote areas of our kingdom. We appreciate and are grateful for the close cooperation between Chinese technicians and our Nepalese colleagues in their work, and for China's aid and cooperation in other economic construction projects in Nepal.

The Crown Prince said that today, Sino-Nepalese relations have reached a peak of friendship, and we highly value our friendship with China. Although there are inevitable differences between our two countries in terms of system and policy towards many issues, as neighboring countries that interact with each other every day, we have developed a spirit of good neighborliness, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence. Both our countries are committed to maintaining world peace.

In his speech, the Crown Prince refuted the "two Chinas" claim, pointing out that this claim is absurd.
