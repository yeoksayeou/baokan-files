    The Fighting Collective
    —On the Ship Where Battle Hero Mai Xiande Served
    Kuang Xinfen
    When we arrived at the unit where Mai Xiande served, the soldiers all told us: “You wrote about Mai Xiande, but you should also write about Sergeant Yang Yingsong, and many other good people. We have many heroes on our艇(tǐng, ship)! They had a great influence on Mai Xiande's growth!”
    Indeed, this is the case. Here we saw a fighting collective holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Mai Xiande grew up under the nurture of the collective. And his heroic actions gave his comrades great encouragement and inspiration, prompting this collective to become more combat-ready and prompting the emergence of more heroes.
          ＊　＊　＊
    A surge of studying Chairman Mao's works unfolded in this naval vessel unit. Countless touching deeds and advanced figures emerged. It was at this time that Mai Xiande came to serve on the 艇(tǐng, ship).
    As soon as he got on the 艇(tǐng, ship), Mai Xiande studied the deeds of two activists in studying Chairman Mao's works with his comrades. One was Long Sanyang, a veteran who had been in the army for nine years and was red for nine years, and the other was Chen Sanjia, a new recruit.
    Long Sanyang had been in the army for nine years, earning a Second Class Merit once and a Third Class Merit twice. Since the unit launched the "Four Goods" and "Five Goods" movement, he has been a Five-Good soldier every year. But when he received a letter from an old comrade, he felt a slight fluctuation in his heart. This comrade mentioned in the letter that he is now serving as a deputy instructor, and then inquired with concern about the comrades who enlisted at the same time as him: "What position are you in now?" How should he answer this comrade? Long Sanyang opened Mao主席(zhǔxí, Chairman)'s works, reading and thinking over and over again. Mao主席(zhǔxí, Chairman)'s words enlightened him: "I joined the revolution to defend the motherland, to defend socialism; to overthrow American imperialism and liberate all mankind. In revolutionary work, the position, whether high or low, is only a difference in the division of labor, and there is absolutely no distinction between nobility and baseness." So he picked up his pen and wrote briskly:
  "I am still a soldier, and I am prepared to be a revolutionary volunteer soldier for the rest of my life!"
    When the new recruit Chen Sanjia had just enlisted, the 艇长(tǐngzhǎng, captain) gave him a copy of "Serve the People" to read. He took the book and only managed to read the two characters "人(rén, person)" and "民(mín, people)" after a long time. He blushed and said, "I only know two characters..." But once this son of a poor peasant understood the significance of studying Chairman Mao's works, he marched towards culture with amazing perseverance. He worked hard to study Chairman Mao's works and truly achieved活学活用(huóxué huóyòng, applying what he learned creatively). Once, during a sea exercise, they encountered a strong wind, and many veteran soldiers who had experienced many storms vomited, and Xiao Chen vomited even more violently. However, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "Determine to make sacrifices, defy difficulties to win victory", which instantly increased his infinite strength. He sang loudly at his gun position. He sang "Go to the Front" and "Earn Merits on the Battlefield," and the more he sang, the more his fighting spirit increased. When the comrades on the entire 艇(tǐng, ship) heard Xiao Chen's singing, they also sang along. The majestic singing suppressed the roar of the raging waves.
    Mai Xiande was greatly educated by his comrades' love for Chairman Mao's works. He repeatedly read Long Sanyang's learning experience and expressed his determination to learn from Chen Sanjia on the blackboard newspaper. However, in terms of mutual help and mutual learning, the closest relationship with Mai Xiande was Sergeant Yang Yingsong.
    There is also a story behind this: When Mai Xiande got on the gun艇(tǐng, ship), he felt that the biggest difficulty was not being able to work independently. He wanted to master the technology quickly. He went down to the engine room and asked his comrades, "Who has the best technology here?" Someone told him that it was Sergeant Yang Yingsong. From then on, Mai Xiande secretly watched Sergeant's every move and resolved to learn from him.
    Once, the warship had been at sea performing missions for a long time. After returning to port, the leaders arranged for them to have a meal and also held a film evening. But at this time, a machine on the gun艇(tǐng, ship) suddenly broke down. When Yang Yingsong found out, he immediately took Mai Xiande to help repair the machine. While repairing the ship, Yang Yingsong's stomach ailment flared up, and he was sweating profusely from the pain, but he still lay under the complex pipes and insisted on working. At this time, Mai Xiande's heart was pounding. He realized that Sergeant’s actions could not be accomplished by technology alone. There was an even more glorious and valuable quality in his comrades.
    "Is my idea of focusing on learning technology right?" Mai Xiande went to Yang Yingsong with this question: "Sergeant, tell me, why are you not afraid of any difficulties?" Yang Yingsong said sincerely: "What I do is too ordinary, any comrade who is willing to listen to Chairman Mao's words will do it." Although the words were simple, Mai Xiande suddenly felt that his eyes lit up. That night, Mai Xiande wrote the following words in his diary: "To make revolution, only by studying Chairman Mao's works can we avoid detours."
    Since then, Yang Yingsong and Mai Xiande have helped each other and moved forward side by side on the road of studying Chairman Mao's works. In the famous "August 6th" naval battle in 1965, they fought side by side and made First Class Merits for the people at the same time with their heroic spirit of having me without the enemy.
          ＊　＊　＊
    Mai Xiande's heroic actions left a deep impression on his comrades. On the 艇(tǐng, ship) and off the 艇(tǐng, ship), on the sea and on the shore, people are talking and thinking about how to creatively apply Chairman Mao's works like Mai Xiande. Wen Xiwei, the after-gunner who fought alongside Mai Xiande and made Second Class Merit, was a veteran soldier whose term of service had expired. When the leader留(liú, retained) him as a backbone, he thought: "Okay, I'll do one more year of义务(yìwù, obligation) for the people." Wen Xiwei compared himself with Mai Xiande's brilliant idea of being a revolutionary volunteer soldier forever, and studied "Serve the People" again, deeply realizing that there was a gap between himself and Mai Xiande, and that he had not yet achieved "completely" and "thoroughly" in serving the people. He made up his mind to hand over everything he had to the people and to the Party, just like Mai Xiande: to be a revolutionary volunteer soldier for the rest of his life. As soon as the battle ended, all the commanders and fighters of the "海上(hǎishàng, Maritime) Hero 艇(tǐng, ship)" began to study the passage "Put down your burden and start up the machine" in "Study and the Current Situation." They studied Chairman Mao's论述(lùnshù, exposition) on how achievements can become a burden, and also learned Chairman Mao's teaching on serving the Chinese people and serving the people of the world, and the fighters became more broad-minded. What they saw in their eyes was not just one or two enemy warships, but they were determined to eliminate imperialism and all reactionaries from the earth. Therefore, the soldiers did not slacken their fighting spirit because they had won a battle, nor did they become arrogant and complacent because they had been commended and rewarded.
    After Mai Xiande was injured, Su Songhao, who took over his battle post, made the following oath as soon as he got on the 艇(tǐng, ship): "What Mai Xiande can do, I can do." This new soldier encountered a gale of force nine on his first voyage. Su Songhao only felt a severe headache and had no strength in his body. At this time, the image of Mai Xiande still insisting on repairing the pipeline after being injured appeared in front of his eyes, and he decided to learn from Mai Xiande. Throughout the voyage, he stayed at his post and never left the machine for a moment. In the initial test, he showed that he was a tough-boned fighter worthy of taking over the hero's post. Huang Riyan, another squad leader and Communist Party member, checked a fault in the cabin in the same storm. He climbed from one cabin to another. Just as he crawled up from the bottom of the cabin and showed half of his body, a huge wave threw him into the sea. Huang Riyan grabbed the handrail tightly and was not in danger, but his waist had been twisted as painfully as if it had been broken. Should he continue the inspection? At this moment, he thought of Mai Xiande. He climbed to the last cabin regardless of everything, and finally discovered and eliminated the fault.
    There are really too many touching deeds and outstanding people! Our pen simply cannot describe them all one by one. We believe that under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, this fighting collective will nurture more Mai Xiande-style heroes and make greater contributions to the people of the motherland and the revolutionary people of the world!

### 战斗的集体——在战斗英雄麦贤得所在的舰艇上

    战斗的集体
    ——在战斗英雄麦贤得所在的舰艇上
    邝新芬
    当我们来到麦贤得所在部队的时候，战士们都这样对我们说：“你们写了麦贤得，还应该写军士长杨映松，还应该写其他好些人。我们艇上的英雄人物可多啦，他们对麦贤得的成长影响可大啦！”
    事实正是这样。我们在这里看到了一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的战斗集体。麦贤得是在集体的哺育下成长起来的。而他的英雄行为，又给予战友们极大的鼓舞和激励，促使这个集体更加战斗化，促使更多的英雄人物涌现出来。
          ＊　＊　＊
    学习毛主席著作的热潮，在这个舰艇部队展开了。无数感人事迹和先进人物涌现出来了。就在这时候，麦贤得来到艇上当兵。
    一上艇，麦贤得就和战友们一起学习了两名学习毛主席著作积极分子的事迹。一个是入伍九年而且九年红的老战士龙三阳，一个是新战士陈三加。
    龙三阳入伍九年，立二等功一次，三等功两次。部队开展“四好”“五好”运动以来，他连年是五好战士。可是当他接到一位老战友来信的时候，心里却产生了一丝波动。这位同志在信上提到他现在担任副指导员，然后又关切地询问和自己同时入伍的战友：“你现在担任什么职务？”怎么回答这位同志呢？龙三阳翻开毛主席著作，一遍又一遍地读着，想着。毛主席的话使他开了窍：“我参加革命是为了保卫祖国，保卫社会主义；是为了打倒美帝国主义，解放全人类。在革命工作中，职务高低，只是分工的不同，而绝没有贵贱之分。”于是他拿起笔来，明快地写道：
  “我现在还是个兵，而且我准备当一辈子革命的义务兵！”
    新战士陈三加刚刚入伍的时候，艇长把一本《为人民服务》送给他读。他把书接过来，半天才念出“人”、“民”两个字。他红着脸说：“我只认识两个字……。”但是，当这位贫农子弟一旦懂得了学习毛主席著作的意义以后，便以惊人的毅力向文化进军。他努力学习毛主席著作，真正做到了活学活用。一次出海演习，遇上大风，许多饱经风浪的老战士都吐了，小陈更是呕吐得厉害。但是，他想起了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，顿时增加了无穷的力量。他在炮位上放声歌唱。他唱了《上前线》，又唱《战场上立功劳》，越唱斗志越昂扬。全艇同志听到小陈的歌声，也都跟着唱起来。雄壮的歌声压住了狂涛的怒吼声。
    战友们这样热爱毛主席著作，使麦贤得受到了很大的教育。他反复地读了龙三阳写的学习心得，在黑板报上表示了向陈三加学习的决心。但是，在互帮互学方面，和麦贤得关系最密切的，是军士长杨映松。
    这里面还有着一段故事：麦贤得一上炮艇，感到最大的困难是不能独立工作。他想把技术迅速掌握起来。他下了机舱，就向战友们打听：“这里谁的技术最过硬”，别人告诉他说是军士长杨映松。从此，麦贤得暗暗地注视着军士长的一举一动，下决心向他学习。
    有一次，舰艇在海上执行任务很久。回港以后，领导安排他们会餐，还举办了电影晚会。可是这时，炮艇上的一部机器突然发生了故障。杨映松知道了，立刻就带着麦贤得去帮助修理机器。修船时，杨映松的胃病发作了，疼得满脸流汗，但他仍然躺在复杂的管道下面坚持工作。这时，麦贤得的心砰砰地跳动起来。他认识到，军士长的所作所为，单凭技术是办不到的。战友们身上有一种更为光彩的可贵品格。
    “我这样偏重学技术的思想对吗？”麦贤得带着这个问题去找杨映松：“军士长，你告诉我，为什么你什么困难都不怕？”杨映松诚恳地说：“我做的事情太平凡了，任何一个肯听毛主席话的同志都会这样做。”话虽简单，可是麦贤得突然觉得眼前亮了。这天晚上，麦贤得在日记上写下了这样的话：“要革命，只有学习毛主席著作，才能不走弯路。”
    从此，杨映松和麦贤得在学习毛主席著作的道路上，互相帮助，并肩前进。他们在一九六五年著名的“八·六”海战里，并肩战斗，以有我无敌的英雄气概，同时为人民立下了一等功。
          ＊　＊　＊
    麦贤得的英雄行为，在战友们心中留下了深刻的印象。艇上艇下，海上岸上，人们都在说着、想着，如何象麦贤得那样活学活用毛主席著作。和麦贤得并肩战斗、立了二等功的后炮长文锡尉，是个服役期满的老兵。当领导把他作为骨干留下来的时候，他想：“好吧，我再多为人民尽一年义务。”文锡尉对照麦贤得永远做革命义务兵的光辉思想，又一次学习了《为人民服务》，深刻地认识到，自己和麦贤得有差距，自己在为人民服务上还没有做到“完全”“彻底”。他下定决心，要把自己的一切交给人民、交给党，象麦贤得一样：做一辈子革命的义务兵。“海上英雄艇”的全体指战员，战斗刚刚结束，就学起《学习和时局》中“放下包袱，开动机器”这段文章来。他们学习了毛主席关于成绩可以变成包袱的论述，又学了毛主席关于为中国人民服务、为世界人民服务的教导，战士们的胸怀越发宽广了。他们眼睛所看到的，不仅仅是一两艘敌人的军舰，他们一心要把帝国主义和一切反动派从地球上消灭掉。因此，战士们没有因为打了一次胜仗而松懈斗志，也没有因为立功受奖而骄傲自满。
    麦贤得受伤后，接替他的战斗岗位的苏松浩，一上艇就立下了这样的誓言：“麦贤得能够做到的，我就能做到。”这位新战士第一次出海，就遇上了九级大风浪。苏松浩只觉得头胀得很厉害，浑身没有一点力气。这时，麦贤得负伤以后仍然坚持检修管道的形象出现在他的眼前，他决心向麦贤得学习，在整个航程中，他坚守岗位，一刻也没有离开机器。在初次考验里，他就表现了不愧为接替英雄岗位的硬骨头战士。另一位班长、共产党员黄日燕，在同样大的风暴中，检查船舱里的一个故障，他从一个舱又爬向另一个舱，刚刚从舱底钻上来，露出了半截身子，一个巨浪把他向海里抛下去。黄日燕紧紧抓住扶手，没有发生危险，可是腰已经被扭得象断了一样疼痛。还要不要继续检查下去呢？在这个时刻，他想起了麦贤得。他不顾一切地向最后一个舱爬去，终于发现并排除了故障。
    感人的事迹，出色的人物实在太多了！我们的笔简直无法把这些一一描绘出来。我们相信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，这个战斗的集体，将会哺育出更多的麦贤得式的英雄人物，为祖国人民，为全世界革命人民做出更大的贡献！
