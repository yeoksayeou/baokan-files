    Mao Zedong Thought is Priceless Treasure
    Emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the people's minds, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of people is the key to changing the impoverished and backward state of ethnic minority areas and is the source of all strength.
    Helping the Poor Starts with Helping Their Ambition; Helping People Starts with Helping Their Hearts
    Xianan District of Huanjiang County in Guangxi is a settlement area for the Maonan ethnic group. In 1964, the CPC Xianan District Committee, in order to help this smaller ethnic group in our country change its backward situation, decided to send people to Daduo No. 2 Production Team of Xianan Commune to establish a model. They also provided the production team with many loans, improved seeds, and chemical fertilizers. As a result, although the production of the production team increased somewhat, the production costs also increased. The members of the team were not satisfied, and other teams could not learn from it, so it did not play a model role.
    Later, they realized that the main reason for the failure of this model was that they had not emphasized politics and had not implemented the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. The second time, they selected Songxian No. 2 Team of Xianan Commune, which had barren land, no paddy fields, and few cattle. Although the natural conditions of this team were not good, there were many poor and lower-middle peasants, who could be relied upon.
    The cadres stationed there came to Songxian No. 2 Team with Mao Zedong's works and the idea of self-reliance. They first grasped the ideological revolutionization of the leadership members of the team committee, deeply mobilized the masses, carried out socialist education movement, and organized cadres and masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. When studying Chairman Mao's article "Introducing a Cooperative," they studied and compared it with the situation of their own team, discussing how to change the backward situation of their team. During the discussion, the members believed that the key to changing the production outlook lies in water conservancy. When it was mentioned that water conservancy should be built, some members said: "Maonan, Maonan, nine droughts in ten years, to build water conservancy, national investment is indispensable!" The Xianan District Committee believed that these words represented the thinking of some members. They seized this living thought and organized members to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai with problems. After this study, the members realized that although there were some difficulties in building water conservancy, it was not as difficult as the three battles of Langwozhang by the people of Dazhai. They must learn the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai. Then, after more than three months of hard work, they completely relied on their own strength to build a 1,760-meter-long stone-built canal, which solved the water problem. In order to reduce production costs, the Xianan District Committee mobilized members to plant green manure red flower grass as fertilizer. Spirit transforms into matter. The team achieved a bumper harvest in 1965, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, an increase of 74 percent over 1964. The members' rations were almost doubled compared with the past, and cash income also increased by 66 percent. In this way, Songxian No. 2 Team jumped from a backward team to a banner of advanced in the Maonan ethnic area. The production competition craze of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing Songxian No. 2 Team has been launched in the Maonan ethnic area, making Songxian No. 2 Team truly play a model role.
      Relying on the Masses, the Potential is Infinite
    Many ethnic minority cadres have learned from their own practice that in the struggle to transform the world, a certain amount of material assistance from the state is necessary, but one cannot simply rely on the state. Only by relying on the masses can production be developed in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    In Dongmen District, Luocheng County, where the Mulao ethnic group lives, the members used to have the idea of simply relying on the state to help develop production. They believed that the state should take more care of ethnic minority areas. Due to the influence of this understanding, many things that should have been done were not done. For example, the water conservancy situation in the whole district has not changed much, and it is threatened by drought every year. In 1964, Dongmen District decided to build two reservoirs. The Daliang Reservoir, located in Dafu Commune, was not started in time because it relied one-sidedly on state assistance. However, the Dilang Reservoir, located in Fengwu Commune, was completed quickly and well. Originally, after the party group and the masses of Dilang Village studied Mao Zedong's works, they decided to rely on their own strength to build the reservoir. They quarried stones themselves, burned lime themselves, and did everything themselves. They built a small reservoir with a capacity of more than 200,000 cubic meters in only 40 days, solving the irrigation problem of more than 260 mu of land in Dilang Village. After the water conservancy problem was solved, the members planted double-cropping rice for the first time in 1965 and achieved a large increase in production.
    Last autumn, the Dongmen District Committee seized the typical example of Dilang, organized cadres from the whole district to visit and study, and mobilized members to discuss the issue of who to build water conservancy for and who to rely on to build water conservancy. As a result, a craze for self-reliance in water conservancy construction was launched in each commune and team, and more than 130 small-scale water conservancy projects were built at once, and the amount of work exceeded the sum total of water conservancy projects built since the cooperative.
    The responsible cadres of Dongmen District said with deep understanding: "Self-reliance is the demand of the masses. It is to be separated from the masses to embrace a pure gift view without taking the road of self-reliance. We must believe that the masses can liberate themselves."
      Emphasizing Politics Requires Self-Revolution First
    There are eleven ethnic minorities in Guangxi, including Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Mulao, and Maonan. Before liberation, these ethnic minority areas had relatively poor industrial and agricultural foundations due to long-term oppression and exploitation. Some people believe that such objective conditions cannot be changed and that it is difficult to achieve anything. As a result, they only see the "backward" side of the ethnic minority mountainous areas, and do not see the advanced side; some even feel uneasy about working there. Others are not like this. They believe that although there are many mountains in the ethnic minority areas and the industrial and agricultural foundation is relatively poor, there is great potential for developing production, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and diversified operations have development prospects.
    If you are poor, you must make revolution. All those who can correctly understand this objective law love the mountainous areas and the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas, so they are in high spirits and have the ambition to transform the world.
    Qiaoshan District, Luocheng County, where Zhuang, Han, Yao, and Mulao ethnic groups live together, was previously considered a poor place "with only two hands, four legs (referring to cattle), and half a catty of iron (referring to hoes)," and it was difficult to change the backward situation. Since 1962, the cadres of the district committee began to study Mao Zedong's works. They were inspired by "On Practice" and drew strength from "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They were not afraid of difficulties or hardships, saw favorable conditions from unfavorable conditions, and moved forward in the face of difficulties. According to the characteristics of many rivers and large drops in the region, they vigorously developed water turbine pumps and the comprehensive utilization of water turbine pumps. They only passed the water conservancy pass in one year. In the short two years from 1964 to 1965, a total of eleven comprehensive utilization stations for water turbine pumps were established, and 27 processing machines such as milling, rice milling, cotton ginning, feed pulping, oil pressing, and tea kneading were installed, which greatly liberated the labor force. In addition, eleven generators were installed, with a total of 170 kilowatts. Among the eleven communes in the district, nine communes and 2,566 households used electric lights for lighting, accounting for 82 percent of the total number of farmers. Three radio relay stations were also established, and 156 loudspeakers were installed, so that more than two-thirds of the production teams could hear the broadcast.
    Chairman Mao said: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to do it, to make revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and good for painting the newest and most beautiful pictures." Changing the backward situation is precisely the urgent demand of the ethnic minority people. Here, the key issue is the revolutionization of the leadership's ideology and work style. Comrade Jiao Yulu said well: "Without cadres who fight against disasters, there will be no masses who fight against disasters." To change the backward situation in mountainous areas, we must first change the mental state of the cadres in these areas, that is, transform the subjective world well.
    The example of Gengsha Commune in Fengshan County can very well illustrate this problem. In the past, this commune was short of water for several months a year, and members had to cross mountains and ridges to fetch water from neighboring counties fifty or sixty miles away. In 1963, they encountered an extraordinary drought, and it became even more difficult to get drinking water. Under such circumstances, the party member cadres of this commune resolutely shared weal and woe with the masses. In the most difficult times, they studied Chairman Mao's "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Work Methods," "Serving the People," "In Memory of Bethune" and other articles, and checked themselves against Chairman Mao's words. They said that Chairman Mao taught us to care about the lives of the masses, but we have not even solved the problem of drinking water for the masses. How can we talk about serving the people? Everyone said that even if they were to go up the mountain of knives and down the sea of fire, they would have to solve the problem of drinking water for people and animals. Driven by the cadres of the whole commune, the masses dug ponds and wells, and worked hard for two winters and springs, finally ending the era when every drop of water was as precious as oil.
    At present, studying Mao Zedong's works has become the urgent demand and conscious action of the masses in the ethnic minority areas of Guangxi. These areas have widely established Mao Zedong's works study groups, and many moving deeds such as couples teaching each other and studying together, and three generations of grandparents and grandchildren studying Mao Zedong's works together have also emerged. Many activists who study Mao Zedong's works say: "If you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, you won't have enough energy and your work will be rough; if you don't read Chairman Mao's books for two days, you won't be able to withstand difficulties; if you don't read Chairman Mao's books for three days, you will forget the bitterness of the class; if you don't read Chairman Mao's books for a long time, you will go the wrong way with your eyes open!"
                                                                                                        Xinhua News Agency Reporters Su Yongqin Liang Jiazhong

### 毛泽东思想是无价宝  突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，促进人的思想革命化，是改变少数民族地区贫困落后面貌的关键所在，是一切力量的源泉。

    毛泽东思想是无价宝
    突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，促进人的思想革命化，是改变少数民族地区贫困落后面貌的关键所在，是一切力量的源泉。
    扶穷先扶志　帮人先帮心
    广西环江县下南区是毛难族聚居区。一九六四年，中共下南区委会为了帮助我国这个人口较少的兄弟民族改变落后面貌，决定派人到下南公社大罗二队蹲点搞样板，并且给了这个生产队许多贷款、良种和化肥，结果这个生产队虽然产量有所增加，但生产成本也增加了。本队社员不满意，别队学不得，起不到样板的作用。
    后来，他们认识到，这次搞样板失败的主要原因是没有突出政治，没有贯彻自力更生的革命精神。第二次，他们就选定土地贫瘠，没有一亩保水田，耕牛又少的下南公社松现二队。这个队虽然自然条件不好，但贫农下中农多，可以作为依靠的力量。
    蹲点的干部们带着毛主席著作和自力更生的思想来到了松现二队。他们首先抓队委领导成员的思想革命化，深入发动群众，开展社会主义教育运动，组织干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作。在学习毛主席《介绍一个合作社》这篇文章时，他们边学边对照本队的情况，讨论如何改变本队的落后面貌。社员在讨论中认为，改变生产面貌的关键在水利。一提到要修水利，有的社员说：“毛难、毛难，十年九旱，要修水利，没有国家投资不行！”下南区委会认为，这些话代表了一部分社员的思想。他们就抓住这个活思想，组织社员带着问题学习《愚公移山》，学习大寨的革命精神。经过这次学习，社员们认识到，虽然他们修水利存在着一些困难，但是比不上大寨人三战狼窝掌的困难大，一定要学习大寨人的革命精神。接着，他们经过三个多月的苦战，完全依靠自己的力量修成了一条一千七百六十多米的石砌渠道，解决了水的问题。为了减低生产成本，下南区委会又发动社员们种绿肥红花草当肥料。精神变物质，这个队一九六五年获得大丰收，平均亩产六百斤，比一九六四年增产百分之七十四；社员们的口粮比过去提高了将近一倍，现金收入也增加了百分之六十六。这样，松现二队便从落后队一跃而成为毛难族地区的一面先进旗帜。学、赶、超松现二队的生产竞赛热潮，已在毛难族地区开展起来，使松现二队真正起到了样板的作用。
      依靠群众　潜力无穷
    许多少数民族干部从自己的实践中体会到：在改天换地的斗争中，国家给予一定的物质支援是必要的，但是不能单纯依赖国家。只有依靠群众，才能多快好省地发展生产。
    么佬族聚居的罗城县东门区，过去社员中存在着单纯依赖国家帮助来发展生产的思想，他们认为，国家对少数民族地区多照顾点是应该的。由于这种认识的影响，有许多该办的事没有办起来，例如全区水利面貌的改变就不大，年年受干旱的威胁。一九六四年，东门区决定要修建两座水库。位于大福公社的大良水库，因为片面依靠国家帮助，没有及时动工。位于凤梧公社的地良水库，却完成得又快又好。原来地良屯的党小组和群众学习了毛主席著作后，决定依靠自己的力量把水库修起来。他们自己打石头，自己烧石灰，一切都自己动手，只四十天就建成了一个库容二十多万方的小水库，解决了地良屯二百六十多亩田的灌溉问题。水利问题解决后，社员们在一九六五年第一次改种双季稻，并且获得大增产。
    东门区委会去年秋天抓住地良这个典型，组织全区干部来参观、学习，并发动社员们讨论了为谁修水利、靠谁修水利的问题。结果，各社、队都掀起了一个自力更生修水利的热潮，一下子就兴修了一百三十多处小型水利工程，工作量超过合作化以来兴修水利工程的总和。
    东门区的负责干部深有体会地说：“自力更生是群众的要求。不走自力更生的道路而抱着单纯的恩赐观点，是脱离群众的。要相信群众自己能够解放自己。”
      突出政治先要自我革命
    广西全区共有壮、瑶、苗、么佬、毛难等十一个少数民族。这些少数民族地区，解放前由于长期受压迫、受剥削，工农业基础都比较差。对这样的客观条件，有些人认为是不能改变的，自己很难有所作为。结果，他们对少数民族山区只看到“落后”的一面，没有看到先进的一面；甚至因而不安心在那里工作。另一些人却不是这样。他们认为少数民族地区虽然山多，工农业基础比较差，但发展生产有着巨大的潜力，农、林、畜牧业和多种经营都有发展前途。
    穷了，就要闹革命。凡是能正确认识这个客观规律的就热爱山区，热爱山区的各民族群众，因而精神振奋，具有改天换地的雄心壮志。
    壮、汉、瑶、么佬四个民族杂居的罗城县乔善区，过去人们认为是“只有两只手，四条腿（指耕牛），半斤铁（指锄头）”的穷地方，落后面貌难以改变。一九六二年起，区委会的干部开始学习毛主席著作，他们从《实践论》中得到了启发，从《愚公移山》中汲取了力量，不怕难，不怕苦，从不利条件中看到有利条件，迎着困难前进。他们根据本地区河流多、落差大的特点，大力发展水轮泵和水轮泵的综合利用，只一年就闯过了水利关。从一九六四年到一九六五年的短短两年内，共建立了十一处水轮泵综合利用站，安装了磨粉、碾米、弹棉、饲料打浆、榨油、揉茶等加工机械二十七台，大大解放了劳动力。另外安装了十一台发电机，共一百七十瓩，全区十一个公社中，有九个公社、二千五百六十六户使用了电灯照明，占总农户的百分之八十二，还建立了三个收音转播站，安装了一百五十六个喇叭，使三分之二以上的生产队能听到广播。
    毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”改变落后面貌正是少数民族人民的迫切要求。这里，关键问题是领导思想作风的革命化。焦裕禄同志说得好：“没有抗灾的干部，就没有抗灾的群众”。要改变山区的落后面貌，首先就要改变这些地区的干部的精神状态，即改造好主观世界。
    凤山县更沙公社的事例就很能说明这个问题。这个社过去一年有几个月缺水，社员要翻山越岭到五、六十里外的邻县去挑水吃。一九六三年遇到特大干旱，吃水就更加困难了。在这种情况下，这个公社的党员干部，坚决和群众同甘共苦。在最困难的时候，他们学习了毛主席的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，《为人民服务》，《纪念白求恩》等文章，对照毛主席的话来检查自己。他们说，毛主席教导我们要关心群众生活，可是我们连群众的饮水问题都没有解决，怎么谈得上为人民服务？大家表示，就是上刀山、下火海也要解决人畜饮水问题。在全社干部的带动下，群众挖塘打井，苦战两个冬春，终于结束了滴水贵如油的时代。
    目前，学习毛主席著作，在广西少数民族地区已成为群众的迫切要求和自觉的行动。这些地区已经广泛地建立起毛主席著作学习小组，还出现了许多如夫妇互教共学、祖孙三代全家共学毛主席著作的动人事迹。很多学习毛主席著作的积极分子说：“一天不读毛主席的书，干劲不足工作粗；两天不读毛主席的书，碰到困难顶不住；三天不读毛主席的书，就会忘记阶级苦；长久不读毛主席的书，睁着眼睛也会走错路！”
