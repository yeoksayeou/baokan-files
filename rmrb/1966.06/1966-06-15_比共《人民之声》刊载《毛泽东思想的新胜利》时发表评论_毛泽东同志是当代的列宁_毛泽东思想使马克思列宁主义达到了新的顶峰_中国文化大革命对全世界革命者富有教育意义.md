    Xinhua News Agency, June 14th dispatch from Brussels: The Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly "People's Voice," fully published the June 4th "People's Daily" editorial "New Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" on June 10th, and published an editor's comment before the article pointing out that Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new peak. China's socialist cultural revolution is very instructive for all Marxists-Leninists and for revolutionaries worldwide.
    The commentary pointed out: "Even after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle still exists."
    The commentary said that the battle waged by Marxist-Leninist parties "inevitably means carrying out a political struggle within the party against all anti-Marxist-Leninist undercurrents, against the erosion of bourgeois ideology, against the conscious or unconscious agents of capitalism and imperialism, and against degenerates and anti-Party elements. This is an indispensable condition for the party itself not to degenerate and be able to accomplish its historical mission."
    The commentary said: The long struggle waged by our party since its establishment in 1921, especially the struggle since we rebuilt the party on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, has also told us this. The fierce struggle we are waging is a struggle against overt or covert Khrushchev revisionism.
    "We ourselves can prove that a healthy organization is good at eliminating unhealthy elements, and the party is strengthened by purifying its interior."
    The commentary then emphasized the great significance of China's Great Cultural Revolution. The commentary said: "The great ideological struggle currently waged by the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, especially on the front of the socialist cultural revolution, has achieved a great victory in the socialist education movement, a victory for proletarian ideology, a victory for Marxism-Leninism, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought." The commentary pointed out, "This struggle is very instructive for us, for all Marxists-Leninists, and for revolutionaries all over the world.
      "This victory of Mao Zedong Thought in China is also a victory for all Marxists-Leninists, the international communist movement, and all revolutionaries."
    The commentary finally emphasized: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, and his universally significant thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the contemporary world. Mao Zedong Thought has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new peak. Marxism-Leninism is the guide to our actions. Therefore, we must better understand Mao Zedong Thought and better apply Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of our country and our times."

    比共《人民之声》刊载《毛泽东思想的新胜利》时发表评论
    毛泽东同志是当代的列宁
    毛泽东思想使马克思列宁主义达到了新的顶峰  中国文化大革命对全世界革命者富有教育意义
    新华社十四日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊六月十日全文刊载《人民日报》六月四日的社论《毛泽东思想的新胜利》，并且在文章前面发表编辑部评论指出，毛泽东同志是当代的列宁，毛泽东思想使马克思列宁主义达到了新的顶峰。中国的社会主义文化大革命对所有马克思列宁主义者，对全世界的革命者都非常富有教育意义。
    评论指出：“即使在建立无产阶级专政以后，阶级斗争也仍然存在。”
    评论说，马克思列宁主义政党所进行的战斗，“必然意味着要在党内进行反对一切反马克思列宁主义逆流、反对资产阶级意识形态的侵蚀、反对资本主义和帝国主义自觉或不自觉的代理人以及反对蜕化分子和反党分子的政治斗争。这是党本身不蜕化变质和能够完成它的历史使命的必不可少的条件。”
    评论说：我们党自一九二一年成立以来所进行的长期斗争，特别是从我们在马克思列宁主义的基础上重新建党以来的斗争，也告诉了我们这一点。我们进行的这场激烈斗争，是反对公开的或隐蔽的赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争。
    “我们自己可以证明，一个健康的组织善于清除不健康的分子，党是通过纯洁内部而加强的。”
    评论接着强调指出了中国文化大革命的巨大意义。评论说：“中国共产党和它的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会目前特别在社会主义文化革命战线上进行的意识形态的伟大斗争，已经取得了社会主义教育运动的伟大胜利，无产阶级意识形态的胜利，马克思列宁主义的胜利，毛泽东思想的胜利。”评论指出，“这场斗争，对我们，对所有的马克思列宁主义者，对全世界的革命者都非常富有教育意义。
      “毛泽东思想在中国取得的这一胜利也是所有的马克思列宁主义者、国际共产主义运动、所有的革命者的一个胜利。”
    评论最后强调说：“毛泽东同志是当代的列宁，他的具有普遍意义的思想是当代世界的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想使马克思列宁主义达到了新的顶峰。马克思列宁主义是我们行动的指南。因此，我们要更好地领会毛泽东思想，根据我们国家和我们时代的具体条件更好地运用马克思列宁主义。”
