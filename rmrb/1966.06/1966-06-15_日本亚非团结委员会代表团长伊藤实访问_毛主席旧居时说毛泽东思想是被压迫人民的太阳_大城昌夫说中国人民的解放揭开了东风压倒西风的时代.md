　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 13th—After visiting Chairman Mao's former residence in Shaoshan, Hunan Province, the five-member delegation of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, led by delegation leader Minoru Ito, left a message on behalf of the delegation: "After visiting Shaoshan, we are even more convinced that Chairman Mao Zedong is the successor and developer of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and the leader of the world's proletarian revolution and national liberation movement. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the sun for the Chinese people who are carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also the sun for the oppressed nations and people all over the world who are striving for liberation and carrying out revolutionary struggles."
　　Delegation member Masao Oshiro also wrote in the guest book: "The liberation of China's 700 million people has ushered in the era of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. Long live the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, who are standing at the forefront of smashing modern revisionism, strengthening the socialist camp, and carrying out the Great Cultural Revolution! Long live the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, who are standing at the forefront of world revolution! Long live the friendly unity between the people of Japan and China!"
　　The delegation visited Hunan Province from the 7th to the 10th. On the 7th, the delegation visited Chairman Mao's former residence in Shaoshan. On the afternoon of the 8th, they visited Qingshuitang, a memorial site of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities. Minoru Ito, the leader of the delegation and permanent director of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, visited Hunan in 1963. He expressed his desire to visit Chairman Mao's hometown and memorial site of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities again. When delegation member Masao Oshiro visited Qingshuitang, a memorial site of Chairman Mao's early revolutionary activities, despite feeling unwell, others advised him to rest, but he insisted on going. Through the visit, they learned about Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in his youth, Chairman Mao's revolutionary family, and the great contributions Chairman Mao made to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, as well as the fact that Chairman Mao brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. Delegation leader Minoru Ito and delegation member Masao Oshiro wrote the above two paragraphs in the guest book respectively.
　　The delegation also visited the Hunan Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative's Xiang Embroidery Factory and the Hunan Rubber Factory. When Ito spoke about his impressions of visiting these two factories, he said, "The three most profound things we felt after visiting the two factories were: first, the workers' practice of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works greatly encouraged us; second, we were very moved by the workers' revolutionary spirit of being in the factory but keeping the country in mind and having the world in sight; third, we further realized that to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, we must thoroughly oppose modern revisionism."
　　On the evening of the 9th, Zhang Delong, vice chairman of the Hunan Branch of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, held a welcome banquet for the delegation. At the banquet, the delegation leader shouted, "Long live the glorious Communist Party of China! Long live the great Chairman Mao!"
　　The delegation has left Changsha for Wuhan.

    毛主席旧居时说毛泽东思想是被压迫人民的太阳
    大城昌夫说中国人民的解放揭开了东风压倒西风的时代
　  新华社长沙十三日电　日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团一行五人在湖南省访问了韶山毛主席旧居后，团长伊藤实代表代表团留言说：“我们访问韶山后，更加确信毛泽东主席是当代马克思列宁主义的继承者和发展者，是全世界无产阶级革命和民族解放运动的领导者。毛泽东思想不仅是正在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的中国人民的太阳，也是争取解放和进行革命斗争的全世界被压迫民族和人民的太阳。”
    团员大城昌夫也在留言簿上写道：“中国七亿人民的解放，揭开了东风压倒西风的时代。站在粉碎现代修正主义、加强社会主义阵营和进行文化大革命前列的中国共产党和毛泽东主席万岁！站在世界革命前列的中国人民和中国共产党万岁！日中两国人民的友好团结万岁！”
    代表团七日到十日在湖南省进行了参观访问。七日，代表团访问了韶山毛主席旧居，八日下午参观了毛主席革命活动纪念地清水塘。代表团团长、日本亚非团结委员会常任理事伊藤实一九六三年曾访问过湖南，他表示这次一定要再次访问毛主席故乡和毛主席革命活动纪念地。团员大城昌夫带病参观毛主席早期从事革命活动的纪念地清水塘时，别人劝他休息，他却坚持要去。通过参观访问，他们了解了毛主席青少年时代的革命活动、毛主席革命的一家和毛主席为中国革命和世界革命所做出的巨大贡献，以及毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义的事实后，团长伊藤实和团员大城昌夫分别在留言簿上写下了上述两段话。
    代表团还参观了湖南省手工业联社湘绣厂和湖南橡胶厂。伊藤实在谈到他们参观这两个工厂的印象时说：“参观两个工厂后，我们感受最深的有三点：第一、工人们活学活用毛主席著作的实际给了我们很大鼓舞；第二、工人身在工厂、胸怀祖国、放眼世界的这种革命精神很使我们感动；第三、我们进一步认识到要坚决反对美帝国主义，就必须彻底反对现代修正主义。”
    九日晚上，中国亚非团结委员会湖南省分会副主席张德隆为代表团举行了欢迎宴会。团长在宴会上高呼：“光荣的中国共产党万岁！伟大的毛主席万岁！”
    代表团已经离开长沙去武汉。
