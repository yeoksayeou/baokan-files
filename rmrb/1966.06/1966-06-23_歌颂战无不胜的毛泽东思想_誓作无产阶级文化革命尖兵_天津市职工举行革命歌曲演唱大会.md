    Singing the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought
    Vowing to be a Vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
    Tianjin Workers Hold Revolutionary Song Concert

    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st dispatch) Tianjin workers recently held a concert singing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They used soaring revolutionary songs to fire at bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," sweeping away all monsters and demons, resolutely defending the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the socialist state, expressing the powerful momentum and strength of the 600,000-plus workers in Tianjin in striking at counter-revolutionary black gangs.

    The concert began with songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao. The large chorus composed of 200 workers from the Tianjin Radio Factory sang "The East is Red." As the song "The East is Red, the sun rises, China produced a Mao Zedong..." resounded, a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao appeared on a wide red backdrop, like a red sun rising from the east, radiating light and illuminating the earth. At this moment, in the theater filled with a revolutionary atmosphere, two thousand four hundred people stood up spontaneously and sang along with the performers, the emotions of the stage and the audience blending together, fully expressing the infinite respect and love of the broad masses of workers for Chairman Mao.

    The programs performed at this concert were mostly fighting songs created, written, and performed by the broad masses of workers themselves in the struggle of the Socialist Cultural Revolution to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking with the old and establishing the new. These programs were a challenge and demonstration against bourgeois "authorities," "scholars," and "experts," and volleys of artillery shells fired at all anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, all monsters and demons. The workers of Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill said it well: the more the counter-revolutionary black gangs oppose Chairman Mao, the more we love Chairman Mao and sing loudly about Chairman Mao. The chorus composed of eighteen old workers from the cylinder shaking maintenance group of this factory took the stage and sang their own created poetic song series "Textile Workers Carry Out Revolution." They used vivid lyrics, simple performances, and sincere emotions to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their bitter hatred for class enemies, which was warmly welcomed by the audience.

    Before the end of the concert, the chorus composed of more than one hundred workers from the Tianjin Electrical Appliance Factory, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, sang "Being a Vanguard of the Cultural Revolution" loudly, expressing the working class's determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    The concert was filled with a revolutionary fighting atmosphere from beginning to end, with stirring songs on stage and thunderous applause from the audience.

    Most of the workers participating in the concert were activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, five-good workers, five-good militiamen, and advanced producers. Although they had not received specialized training, they firmly believed that as long as they held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and followed Chairman Mao's instructions, they would definitely be able to create a new socialist culture and become the masters of the socialist literary and artistic stage. During the creation and rehearsal process, many people studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other articles, clarifying the significance and role of literature and art as a weapon in the class struggle. Therefore, they had a clear direction and full confidence, and they all regarded this performance as a battle with the bourgeoisie for the cultural front. In order to forcefully counter the rampant attacks of the counter-revolutionary black gangs, the workers of the Tianjin Radio Factory, with strong class feelings, wrote six songs with strong fighting spirit, such as "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of the Mao Zedong Era" and "We Workers Have the Reddest Hearts" in two days.

    歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    誓作无产阶级文化革命尖兵
    天津市职工举行革命歌曲演唱大会
    据新华社天津二十一日电  天津市职工最近举行歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席、歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想演唱大会。他们用高昂的革命歌曲，向资产阶级“权威”、“专家”开火，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决保卫党中央、保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义江山，表达了天津市六十多万职工打击反革命黑帮的强大声势和力量。
    演唱大会是在歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的歌声中开始的。天津无线电厂二百名工人组成的大型合唱队演唱了《东方红》，随着“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”的歌声，宽阔的红色天幕上出现了我们伟大领袖毛主席的画象，好似一轮红日从东方升起，光芒四射，普照大地。这时，在充满革命气氛的剧场里，两千四百多人不约而同地站了起来，和演员们一起引吭高歌，台上台下的感情热烈地交融一起，充分表达了广大职工对毛主席的无限尊敬和热爱。
    这次演唱大会演唱的节目，大都是广大职工在社会主义文化大革命兴无灭资的斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破旧立新，自编自演的战斗歌曲。这些节目是向资产阶级“权威”、“学者”、“专家”的挑战和示威，是向一切反党反社会主义黑帮、一切牛鬼蛇神射出的一排排炮弹。天津国棉二厂工人们说得好，反革命黑帮越是反对毛主席，我们越是热爱毛主席，高声歌唱毛主席。这个厂筒摇保全小组的十八名老工人组成的合唱队，登台演唱了自己创作的诗歌联唱《纺织工人干革命》，他们用鲜明生动的歌词，朴素的表演，真挚的感情，表现出对毛主席的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    演唱会结束前，天津电器厂一百多名工人组成的合唱队，满怀革命豪情，高歌《当文化革命的尖兵》，表达了工人阶级坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。
    演唱大会自始至终充满了革命的战斗气氛，台上歌声激荡，台下掌声雷动。
    参加演唱的职工，大多数是学习毛主席著作的积极分子、五好职工、五好民兵、先进生产者，他们虽然没有受过专门训练，但是他们坚信，只要高举毛泽东思想红旗，按照毛主席的指示去做，就一定能够搞出社会主义的新文化，作社会主义文艺舞台的主人。在创作排练中，许多人学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等文章，明确了文艺这个武器在阶级斗争中的意义和作用。因此，他们方向明确、信心很足，都把这次演出看作是和资产阶级争夺文化阵地的战斗。天津无线电厂职工，为了有力地回击反革命黑帮的猖狂进攻，怀着强烈的阶级感情，两天就编写出《毛泽东时代的工农兵》、《咱们工人心最红》等六首富有强烈战斗性的歌曲。
