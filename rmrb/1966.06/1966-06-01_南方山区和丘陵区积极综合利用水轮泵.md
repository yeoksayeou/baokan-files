    A Quick, Effective, Economical, and Labor-Saving Way to Achieve Self-Flowing Irrigation, Mechanized Processing, and Electrification
    Actively and Comprehensively Utilize Water Turbine Pumps in Southern Mountainous and Hilly Areas
    When promoting the use of water turbine pumps, the principles of focusing on small and medium-sized pumps, relying mainly on communes and production teams for self-management, and prioritizing irrigation should be implemented. Simultaneously, the combination of water lifting and water storage, water diversion, irrigation and processing/power generation, dam construction and waterway improvement should be achieved for comprehensive development.

    (Our dispatch from Changsha, May 31st) Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in the mountainous and hilly areas of southern China are actively promoting water turbine pumps, creatively leveraging their potential effectiveness. The promotion and utilization of water turbine pumps has already progressed from small to large, low to high, and from simply lifting water to irrigate fields to comprehensive utilization. Practice in various regions has proven that promoting the use of water turbine pumps in mountainous and hilly areas is not only a crucial basic construction project to ensure drought and flood prevention, stable yields, and high yields for farmland, but also a quick, effective, economical, and labor-saving way to achieve self-flowing irrigation, mechanized processing, and electrification in these areas.
    The promotion and use of water turbine pumps in the mountainous and hilly areas of southern China is a new endeavor. In recent years, especially since 1964, southern regions have strengthened leadership over the work of promoting water turbine pumps, incorporating their promotion and use into farmland capital construction plans. Leading cadres in many areas have also personally stayed at selected points to create models, continuously summarizing experiences, enabling new achievements in the promotion of water turbine pumps, both in terms of scale and scope of application. Today, water turbine pumps have developed from simply lifting water directly to irrigate fields to combining with ponds, reservoirs, and dams. That is, during the agricultural season when water is needed, water turbine pumps directly lift water to irrigate fields, and at other times, the water is diverted to mountain ponds and reservoirs for storage. This not only fully utilizes river water sources and expands the irrigation benefits of mountain ponds and reservoirs, but also fully leverages the role of water turbine pumps. Various regions have also creatively connected multiple water turbine pumps in series to achieve high lift, connected multiple water turbine pumps in parallel to a single pipeline to obtain large water volume, and used multiple water turbine pumps to drive a single transmission shaft to obtain large power. In the past, a water turbine pump station could generally only irrigate dozens or hundreds of mu of farmland with a lift of about ten meters; now it has developed to the point where it can lift water to mountaintops over one hundred meters high, irrigating tens of thousands or even tens of thousands of mu of farmland. Several larger water turbine pump stations recently built in Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces and regions have lifts as high as one hundred and fifty meters, becoming the most economical and effective water lifting tool for high-bank farmland in mountainous areas. Many regions, when establishing water turbine pump stations, have paid attention to ensuring that dam construction does not hinder navigation and timber floating, and have implemented a combination of irrigation, processing, and power generation, realizing the comprehensive utilization of water turbine pump stations, providing experience for developing mountainous streams and rivers and water resources.
    Practice has proven that the new development in the promotion and application of water turbine pumps has found a quick, effective, economical, and labor-saving path for accelerating the realization of self-flowing irrigation, mechanized processing, and electrification in mountainous areas. According to a survey of several larger water turbine pump stations in Hunan Province: In addition to irrigating tens of thousands of mu of farmland, they can also provide hundreds of kilowatts of electricity to rural areas. Building such a water turbine pump station generally takes only about half a year, which is much shorter than building a small hydropower station of the same scale, and the cost is also much lower.
    The path that China has taken in promoting water turbine pumps is to hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, adhere to self-reliance, adhere to technological revolution, adhere to the mass line, and vigorously launch mass movements. In 1956, when water turbine pumps began to be promoted in the mountainous areas of Fujian, people's understanding, mastery, and application of them were not very conscious. Some people believed that water turbine pumps were small things and small gadgets that would not solve big problems, and they did not actively promote their use. Some places failed to promote them, did not promptly summarize lessons, and did not find ways to improve them; if they succeeded, they did not promptly summarize experiences and continue to develop and improve. In 1964, driven by the socialist education movement, people took the Dazhai people as an example, creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, emancipated their minds, and established the ambition to change the face of mountainous and hilly areas, bringing the promotion and application of water turbine pumps to a new stage.
    When Pingjiang County in Hunan Province began to promote water turbine pumps, some people doubted whether water turbine pumps could solve the water conservancy problems in the mountainous areas of Pingjiang County. The Pingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized cadres and commune members throughout the county to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "On Practice," and "On Contradiction," which enlightened people's minds, increased their ambition, and added to their courage. The masses of Pingjiang said: "If the Foolish Old Man can be determined to move mountains, can't we tens of thousands of people in the county build water turbine pump stations?" Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they raised funds themselves if they didn't have funds, found equipment themselves if they didn't have equipment, learned technology themselves if they didn't have technology, and created models if they didn't have experience. After practice, recognition, re-practice, and re-recognition, in more than a year, the county built a total of one hundred and forty-three water turbine pump stations, installed two hundred and fifty-one water turbine pumps, and enabled more than 140,000 mu of farmland to achieve drought and flood protection. These water turbine pump stations also installed generators that can generate more than 1,200 kilowatts, and drove more than 300 processing machines such as rice mills, oil presses, flour mills, and cotton gins. Of the water turbine pump stations that have been built, except for a few larger projects that received some loans and investment assistance from the state, one hundred and six of them did not require the state to spend a penny. The people of Pingjiang have also been tempered in the process of building water turbine pump stations. They said: Through vigorously developing water turbine pumps, we have revolutionized conservative thinking, rooted self-reliance, and learned the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people.
    Many places in Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions have taken the same path as Pingjiang County and achieved the same achievements. According to statistics from ten southern provinces and regions, more than 43,000 water turbine pumps have been installed, setting an example and creating experience for the large-scale promotion and use of water turbine pumps in the future. In addition, a number of water turbine pumps have also been installed in high-altitude and cold mountainous areas such as Tibet, the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
    In order to enable water turbine pumps to be promoted more quickly in mountainous and hilly areas, the State Council's Office of Agriculture and Forestry recently held an on-site meeting in Changsha City, Hunan Province. Leading cadres from relevant departments of the central government and twelve provinces and regions including Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Xinjiang, and Tibet participated in this meeting. During the meeting, the participants visited sixteen large, medium, and small water turbine pump stations in Pingjiang, Liuyang, Chen County, Guiyang, and other counties in Hunan Province. The meeting believed that promoting water turbine pumps in mountainous and hilly areas, which can realize both self-flowing irrigation and mechanized processing and electrification, is a work of great economic and political significance, and all regions should incorporate the promotion of water turbine pumps into water conservancy construction plans. The meeting determined that provinces and regions that have fully begun promotion should actively and systematically carry out promotion. These provinces and regions should create a model for developing and comprehensively utilizing a large and medium-sized river to further promote the work of promoting water turbine pumps. Other provinces (regions) can first conduct pilot projects. Based on existing experience, the principles of focusing on small and medium-sized pumps, relying mainly on communes and production teams for self-management, and prioritizing irrigation should be implemented during promotion. Simultaneously, the combination of water lifting and water storage, water diversion, irrigation and processing/power generation, dam construction and waterway improvement should be achieved for comprehensive development to accelerate the construction of mountainous and hilly areas.
    The meeting also requested relevant departments to provide conditions for the development of water turbine pumps, strengthen collaboration, and suggested that industrial departments, to adapt to the needs of developing large rivers, produce a batch of large-scale water turbine pumps, produce and organize a batch of parts and accessories needed for water turbine pumps, and supply them to rural areas.

    实现灌溉自流化、加工机械化和电气化的一条多快好省的途径
    南方山区和丘陵区积极综合利用水轮泵
    推广使用水轮泵，应贯彻中小型为主、社队自办为主、灌溉为主的原则，同时做到提水与蓄水、引水相结合，灌溉与加工发电相结合，筑坝与改善航道相结合，综合开发。
    本报长沙三十一日电　我国南方山区和丘陵地区的广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极推广水轮泵，创造性地发挥水轮泵的潜在效能，使水轮泵的推广、使用工作，已经发展到由小到大、由低到高、由单一地提水灌田到综合利用的新阶段。各地的实践证明，在山区、丘陵区推广使用水轮泵，不仅是使农田实现旱涝保收、稳产高产的一项重要基本建设，也是使这些地区实现灌溉自流化、加工机械化和电气化的一条多快好省的途径。
    我国南方山区和丘陵地区推广使用水轮泵，是一件新的工作。近几年来，特别是从一九六四年以来，南方各地加强了对推广水轮泵工作的领导，把推广使用水轮泵，纳入了农田基本建设规划。许多地区的领导干部，还亲自蹲点办样板，不断总结经验，使水轮泵的推广工作，无论是规模上，或是应用范围上，都取得了新的成就。如今，水轮泵已由单一的提水直接灌田发展到与塘库坝相结合。即在农田需水季节，水轮泵直接提水灌田，平时则把水引到山塘水库里蓄起来。这样，既充分利用了江河水源，扩大了山塘水库的灌溉效益，又能充分发挥水轮泵的作用。各地还创造性地把多台水轮泵串连起来，取得了高扬程；多台水轮泵并连一条管道出水，取得大水量；多台水轮泵带一个传动轴，取得大动力。过去，一个水轮泵扬水站，一般只能灌溉几十亩或几百亩农田，扬程十米左右；现在发展到能够将水提到百米以上的山头，灌溉上万亩甚至几万亩农田。广东、福建、湖南、广西、贵州等省、区最近兴建的几座较大的水轮泵扬水站，扬程高达一百五十米，成为山区高岸农田最经济、效益最大的提水工具。许多地区在建立水轮泵扬水站时，都注意做到筑坝不妨碍航运和流放木材，并且实行灌溉、加工、发电相结合，实现了水轮泵扬水站的综合利用，为开发山区溪水和江河水利资源提供了经验。
    实践证明，水轮泵推广、应用工作的新发展，为加速山区实现灌溉自流化和加工机械化、电气化，找到了一条多快好省的道路。据湖南省几个较大的水轮泵扬水站调查：除了能灌溉上万亩农田以外，还能为农村提供几百瓩的电力。兴建一个这样的水轮泵扬水站，一般只用半年左右时间，比修建一个同样规模的小型水力发电站时间短得多，费用也少得多。
    我国推广水轮泵所走的道路，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持自力更生，坚持技术革命，坚持走群众路线，大搞群众运动的道路。一九五六年，水轮泵开始在福建山区推广的时候，人们对它的认识、掌握和运用，还是不很自觉的。有的人认为水轮泵是小东西、小玩艺，不解决大问题，没有积极推广使用。有的地方推广失败了，没有及时总结教训，找出改进的途径；成功了，没有及时总结经验，继续发展提高。一九六四年，在社会主义教育运动的推动下，人们以大寨人为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，解放了思想，树立了改变山区和丘陵地区面貌的雄心壮志，使水轮泵推广和应用，发展到一个新的阶段。
    湖南省平江县在开始推广水轮泵的时候，有的人怀疑水轮泵，能不能解决平江县山区的水利问题。中共平江县委针对这些问题组织全县干部和社员学习毛主席著作《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》等文章，使人们的思想亮堂了，增长了志气，增添了胆略。平江的群众说：“愚公能下决心移山，我们全县几十万人难道不能把水轮泵扬水站建成？”在毛泽东思想指引下，他们没有资金自己凑，没有器材自己找，没有技术自己学，没有经验办样板。经过实践认识，再实践再认识，在一年多的时间里，全县共兴建了一百四十三个水轮泵扬水站，安装了二百五十一台水轮泵，使十四万多亩农田实现了旱涝保收，这些水轮泵扬水站还安装了可发电一千二百多瓩的发电机，并且带动了三百多台碾米、榨油、磨粉、弹花等加工机械。已经兴建的这些水轮泵扬水站，除少数工程较大的国家给了一部分贷款和投资扶助外，其中有一百零六个站没有要国家花一分钱。平江人民在建设水轮泵扬水站过程中也得到了锻炼。他们说：经过大搞水轮泵，革了保守思想的命，扎了自力更生的根，学了大寨人的革命精神。
    湖南、福建、广东、广西、贵州、四川等省区的许多地方，走和平江县一样的路，取得了同样的成就。据南方十个省、区的统计，已经安装水轮泵四万三千多台，为今后大量推广使用水轮泵，树立了样板，创造了经验。此外，在西藏等高寒山区、甘肃的河西走廊以及新疆维吾尔自治区，也安装了一批水轮泵。
    为了使水轮泵能更快地在山区和丘陵地区推广，最近国务院农林办公室在湖南省长沙市召开了一次现场会，参加这次现场会的有中央以及广东、广西、福建、湖南、湖北、贵州、云南、四川、江西、浙江、新疆、西藏等十二个省、区的有关部门领导干部。会议期间，与会人员在湖南省的平江、浏阳、郴县、桂阳等县，参观了十六个大中小型水轮泵扬水站。会议认为，在山区、丘陵区推广使用既能实现灌溉自流化，又能实现加工机械化和电气化的水轮泵，是一件具有重大经济意义和政治意义的工作，各地应当把推广水轮泵纳入水利建设规划。会议确定：凡是全面开始推广的省、区，应该积极地有计划地进行推广，这些省、区应该办好一个开发综合利用一条大中型河道的样板，以进一步推动水轮泵的推广工作。其他各省（区）可先搞试点。根据已有的经验，在推广中应贯彻中小型为主、社队自办为主、灌溉为主的原则，同时做到提水与蓄水、引水相结合，灌溉与加工发电相结合，筑坝与改善航道相结合，综合开发，加速山区和丘陵地区的建设。
    会议还要求有关部门，为发展水轮泵提供条件，加强协作，并建议工业部门，适应开发大江大河的需要，生产一批大型号水轮泵，生产、组织一批水轮泵所需要的零件、配件，供应农村。
