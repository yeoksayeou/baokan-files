    Hanoi, June 16 (Xinhua) – The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published an editorial on the 14th, emphasizing that the great victories of the South Vietnamese army and people in the dry season eloquently prove that the people's war of the South Vietnamese people has defeated and will certainly completely defeat the US imperialist war of aggression, and that the strategy and tactics of people's war have defeated and will certainly completely defeat the strategy and tactics of US imperialist neo-colonialist aggression.

    The editorial pointed out that the comprehensive military and political victories achieved by the South Vietnamese army and people in the dry season have frustrated the first strategic plan of US imperialism's localized war. This victory is a victory for the correct political and military line of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, a victory for the strategy and tactics of people's war, and a result of the determination and courageous fighting spirit of all the people and soldiers of South Vietnam to fight the war of resistance against America for national salvation.

    The editorial pointed out that the US aggressors are extremely stubborn. They are still unwilling to abandon their aggressive ambitions and are deploying new adventures. They are sending more American and puppet troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the destructive war against North Vietnam.

    The editorial said that in the face of the US aggressors' sinister conspiracies and plans, the army and people of both North and South Vietnam must further enhance their determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits more than ever before. Our great victory in the dry season has powerfully encouraged us, further consolidating and strengthening our confidence in achieving complete victory in the cause of resistance against America for national salvation.

    The editorial said that our people's war has powerful and invincible strength. The fighting practice of our people has proven this. The US aggressors have no way to deal with the strategy and tactics of our South Vietnamese army and people. It will be completely defeated militarily. The editorial said that inspired by the victories of the South Vietnamese army and people in the dry season, they have confidently ushered in the rainy season battles, achieving brilliant war exploits on all battlefields, continuously attacking the enemy in various encirclements to annihilate Americans and on various transportation lines, attacking many enemy strongholds, bases, and airports, striving for new victories, and dealing heavy blows to the US aggressor forces, puppet troops, and accomplice troops, plunging them deeper into the predicament of defeat.

    The *Quan Doi Nhan Dan* published a commentary on the 3rd, saying that after suffering heavy and comprehensive defeats in the dry season, the US aggressors stubbornly dispatched US military mobile units and some puppet troops, as well as South Korean accomplice troops, to launch "sweeps" in the provinces of Binh Dinh, Gia Lai, Tay Ninh, and Ba Ria. However, these "sweeps" have all been defeated.

    The commentary said that the three branches of the Liberation Armed Forces closely cooperated in fighting and attacking the enemy in various counter-"sweep" battles. In the battles, the soldiers fought with the enemy in bayonet charges with tenacity and bravery. They attacked the enemy during their marches and encampments, terrifying the enemy.

    The commentary said that the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces achieved significant victories in May, continued to maintain the strategic initiative on the battlefield, and also powerfully supported the increasingly high tide of political struggles of the urban and rural people.

    The South Vietnamese *Giai Phong Quan* recently published a commentary saying that the raging flames of the people's war in South Vietnam have been and are burning at various US military bases, and the US aggressor forces can no longer find a safe place.

    The commentary pointed out that the continuous and significant victories achieved by the South Vietnamese army and people in various parts of the enemy's rear during the five months of the dry season have made the nerves of the US aggressors as tense as piano strings. They have had to use more US mobile units to protect their bases and cannot maneuver. But is this really safe? Now, no American aggressor dares to be sure of this. The commentary said that to carry out "sweeps" in the liberated areas is to court death, and lying in their nests does not guarantee their lives. The American bandits are becoming more and more shaken. Not only are the puppet troops and the puppet regime accelerating their collapse and disintegration, but also in the hearts of the US expeditionary forces, the hope of victory has been shattered, and the fire of anti-war sentiment is burning among American soldiers.

    The commentary concluded by pointing out that in the dry season, the raging flames have already been burning at various US military bases. In the rainy season, the flames will not only not be extinguished, but will certainly burn even more fiercely.

    越南南北方报纸欢呼人民战争所向无敌
    旱季大捷声中揭开了雨季战斗序幕
    在遍及各个战场的歼美包围圈和交通线上连续出击取得辉煌战功
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》十四日发表社论强调指出，越南南方军民旱季大捷雄辩地证明，越南南方人民的人民战争已经战胜而且一定能够彻底战胜美帝国主义的侵略战争，人民战争的战略和战术已经战胜、而且一定能够彻底战胜美帝国主义的新殖民主义侵略战争的战略和战术。
    社论指出，越南南方军民在旱季中取得的军事上和政治上的全面胜利，挫败了美帝国主义的局部战争的第一个战略计划。这一胜利是越南南方民族解放阵线的正确政治路线和军事路线的胜利，是人民战争的战略、战术的胜利，是全体越南南方人民和战士决心进行抗美救国战斗和勇敢战斗精神的结果。
    社论指出，美国侵略者是极其顽固的。它仍然不肯放弃侵略野心，而且正在部署新的冒险。它正在向越南南方增派美国和仆从军队，并且加紧进行对越南北方的破坏性战争。
    社论说，面对着美国侵略者的罪恶阴谋和计划，越南北南两方军民比任何时候都要更进一步提高战胜美国侵略强盗的决心。我们在旱季中的巨大胜利，有力地鼓舞着我们，更进一步巩固和坚定了我们对抗美救国事业取得完全胜利的信心。
    社论说，我们的人民战争具有强大的无敌力量。我国人民的战斗实践证明了这一点。美国侵略者没有任何方法能够对付我国南方军民的战略和战术。它在军事上必将被完全击败。社论说，越南南方军民在旱季胜利的鼓舞下，信心百倍地揭开了雨季战斗的序幕，在遍及各个战场上取得了辉煌的战功，在各个歼美包围圈和各条交通线上连续进攻敌人，袭击敌人许多据点、基地和机场，争取新的胜利，给予美国侵略军、伪军和帮凶军以沉重的打击，使它们更深地陷入失败的困境。
    《人民军队报》三日发表评论说，美国侵略者在旱季中遭到惨重和全面失败之后，又顽固地出动美军机动部队和部分伪军以及南朝鲜帮凶军，向平定、嘉莱、西宁、巴地等省发动“扫荡”。但是，这些“扫荡”都遭到了失败。
    评论说，解放武装力量的三种军队，在各次反“扫荡”战斗中，密切配合战斗打击敌人。战士们在战斗中以顽强和勇敢的战斗作风，同敌人进行白刃战。他们在敌人行军和驻军的时候袭击敌人，使敌人丧魂落魄。
    评论说，南方解放武装力量在五月份取得了重大胜利，继续保持了战场上的战略主动权，也有力地支持了日益高涨的城乡人民的政治斗争。
    越南南方《解放军报》最近发表评论说，南越人民战争的熊熊烈火，已经和正在美军各个基地燃烧，美国侵略军再也找不到安全的地方。
    评论指出，越南南方军民旱季五个月在敌人后方各地连续取得的巨大胜利，使得美国侵略者的神经已经紧张得象琴弦一样。他们不得不把更多的美国机动部队用来保卫基地而不能机动。但是这样做是不是就安全了呢？现在，任何一个美国侵略者也不敢肯定这一点。评论说，对解放区进行“扫荡”是送死，而躺在巢穴里也保不住性命，美国强盗们越来越动摇了。不仅伪军、伪政权加速崩溃和瓦解，而且在美国远征军的心里，胜利的希望也已经破灭了，在美国士兵中，反战的怒火正在燃烧起来。
    评论最后指出，在旱季中，烈火已经在各个美军基地熊熊地燃烧起来了。在雨季中烈火不仅不会熄灭，而且肯定会烧得更旺。
