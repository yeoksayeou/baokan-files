    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 15th - Fatmir Gjata, head of the Albanian delegation attending the World Peace Council meeting, spoke at the plenary session on the 14th. The full text is as follows: Dear friends and comrades:
    The World Peace Council meeting is being held at a time when mankind has entered a stage of profound revolutionary change. The flames of wars of aggression shroud the skies of many countries in the world, and the people of many countries are making tremendous sacrifices for the cause of peace, freedom, and national dignity, and against imperialism and reactionaries. Inspired by the lofty ideals of freedom, democracy, and social progress, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been and are continuing to break the chains of imperialist and colonial rule. A new world without oppressors and exploiters is being born, based on the principles of peace, independence, national sovereignty, and equality between large and small nations. The imperialists and colonialists, headed by the United States, these old masters of the old world, rise up against this new world. They regard the people of any country that demands freedom as enemies, regard any progressive movement as subversion, and attempt to extend their rule, oppression, and plunder to the whole world. They launch barbaric attacks on the Congolese people who are fighting for freedom and the people all over the world, send their troops to suppress the Dominican people, use napalm bombs and poison gas in South Vietnam, bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam day and night, set up military bases all over the world, and take international plunder and the use of violence as a system and a matter of course.
    Today, the people of all countries recognize their strength and their rights more than ever before. They rightly regard U.S. imperialism as their most ferocious enemy. The people of all countries no longer want any masters and will never be enslaved again. They yearn for peace, but it is definitely not peace under foreign enslavement, because there will be no peace without freedom. They want to live free and independent lives, to establish the system they like, to be the masters of their own destiny, to build a new life according to their own traditions and aspirations, and to make their own contributions to all the issues of concern to mankind on the basis of equality and mutual respect. To achieve this goal, they are strengthening solidarity and mutual assistance against the dying old colonialism, against American colonialism which is replacing the old colonialism and is more cunning and more dangerous, and against the repressive and aggressive policies of imperialism and its accomplices.
    In this tense situation, our world peace movement must unequivocally and powerfully reaffirm the fundamental principles on which it is based. If we do not explicitly state in the aims of the world peace movement the great truth of this century that imperialism is the source of war and the main enemy, if we regard all struggles, even the liberation struggles of all countries, as dangerous to peace, then it is very likely that we will equate the imperialist aggressors with their victims, or worse, accept the deception of the U.S. government - the U.S. government is trying to create the impression that it is so-called hoping to achieve peace in Vietnam, while the Vietnamese people who are resisting aggression and fighting for national independence want to fight! In recent years, some representatives of the peace committees have no longer firmly maintained the important principles we formulated at the Paris Conference, and these principles have become a dead letter.
    In order to bring our movement back to the revolutionary traditions of its founding, the world peace movement must smash the sinister plans of the imperialists and thwart all attempts aimed at paralyzing the vigilance of the people of all countries against imperialism, because without this, peace cannot be defended. Our movement must not deviate from its main purpose, which is to inspire the people of all countries to fight to defend peace and against acts of aggression. This movement should not cater to the political interests of one country, but must conform to the interests of the peace-loving people of all countries.
    We have come here to meet not to pass some resolutions and appeals, but to mobilize the people of all countries to maintain vigilance and fight against the source of imperialist war and against the aggressors who threaten peace. Only by firmly standing on the side against imperialism can we realize the hope of the people of all countries for the world peace movement.
    In the current situation, the center of the great struggle between the people of all countries and imperialism is undoubtedly the Vietnam War. Today, the United States, disregarding the future of peace, freedom, and self-determination of the people of all countries, is challenging all freedom-loving countries and people, and also challenging the world peace movement. The Vietnamese people, who have paid a heavy price, are waging a heroic struggle of world significance, breaking the hands and feet of the most powerful imperialist country, demonstrating the great power of people's war, and showing once again that no force in the world can overwhelm the people who are fighting for the just cause of freedom and national independence.
    The U.S. imperialists - the professional murderers of the world - are waging a war of destruction in Vietnam. They are practicing genocide, killing elementary school students and pregnant women. This is a heinous crime against humanity and peace, which is naturally arousing the utmost anger of the people of all countries, and this crime cannot be covered up by pacifist deception. The world peace movement must mobilize the people of all countries to rise up against the executioners who have committed this crime, and mobilize them through various concrete mass actions, instead of just through some resolutions, appeals, and petitions that mislead the people and lead to compromise and surrender in the face of imperialist blackmail.
    The U.S. imperialists can only suffer an inevitable defeat in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people will win. Their victory is the most valuable contribution to our movement for peace, because their blow to U.S. imperialism is a blow to the main enemy of peace. Any action by the people of all countries to weaken imperialism is conducive to peace and strengthens our movement, and enhances the prestige of our movement in the minds of the people all over the world.
    In order to escape its failure in Vietnam, the United States has put forward proposals for "peace negotiations," trying to achieve through this means the victory they cannot get on the battlefield, that is, they want to permanently occupy South Vietnam and divide Vietnam into two parts. The people of any country, when subjected to enemy aggression, will take action like the Vietnamese people and will never accept "peace negotiations" before the aggressors withdraw from their country, otherwise, it is surrender, or it is the kind of peace that Hitler made in Munich, which was the prelude to World War II. The people of all countries hope to restore peace in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people even more hope to restore peace. However, if this method of "peace negotiations" succeeds in Vietnam, the United States will have a greater appetite and will apply this method to other countries in the world. Therefore, in this case, any attempt to discuss is fundamentally detrimental to the cause of peace, but is beneficial to the aggressors.
    The Albanian people regard the cause for which the Vietnamese people are fighting as their own cause. The Albanian people stand on the same front and in the same combat works with their Vietnamese brothers every moment, because the enemy of Vietnam is the most ferocious enemy of all mankind.
    Our delegation believes that the true friends of the Vietnamese people, the true friends of freedom and peace, have realized that on this issue, which is extremely important to the goal of overall peace, the purely theoretical speeches made by the Soviet leaders against interfering in the internal affairs of some countries will not benefit the Vietnamese people, but will benefit the aggressors. The Soviet leaders have repeatedly stated that aggression against a socialist country is aggression against the Soviet Union. But what have they done? Why don't they help the Democratic Republic of Vietnam? At least why not sever their relations with the aggressors? When a government assumes an obligation, when it has all the necessary means and has a sincere intention, it must order the aggressors to stop. Why don't the Soviet leaders do this? The reason is very simple. A whole new line aimed at establishing joint hegemony in the world has been drawn up between them and the US government, because for them, US imperialism is no longer a murderer, an oppressor, and an international gendarme, but a "peace-loving" "rational person", because, they believe that "any spark will cause a thermonuclear war," therefore, they act as firefighters to extinguish the flames of all liberation movements of the people in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Soviet leaders show in words that they are friends of Vietnam, and further show that they oppose U.S. imperialism and support the liberation movements of the people of all countries, but their actions show that they are collaborators with the U.S. government. According to their words, people expect the U.S. government to take "some real steps towards improving the world's political atmosphere." They are talking about "a very broad area of cooperation with the United States," "the United States has been seriously considering calls for a peaceful competition," and even "the United States is ready to use the money saved from disarmament to help the people of underdeveloped countries develop their economies and national cultures." They are propagating arguments that threaten the people of all countries and are beneficial to the imperialist colonists. According to these arguments, "the roots of colonialism have disappeared," and "the primary obligation of the oppressed countries and people is no longer to fight against imperialism and colonialism, but to strive to develop the national economy and culture."
    These facts show that the purpose of their competition with imperialism is to smash the national liberation movement and to obstruct the liberated countries from strengthening their national independence, so that they can personally break into these countries and establish new colonial rule.
    Everyone knows the price the Congolese people have paid for the Soviet leaders' cooperation with the US imperialists, who used fire to extinguish the Congolese people's just struggle with the consent of the United Nations. Now the Soviet leaders are discussing with the United States to form a permanent armed force of the United Nations, which is nothing more than an international gendarmerie to suppress the liberation struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and other countries.
    The World Peace Council must call on the people of all countries to condemn these dangerous conspiracies that threaten universal peace, call on workers, sailors, women and young people of all countries to take concrete action to support unreservedly the struggle of the people of Vietnam and the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America, stop the aggressors and expose the surrender and compromise policies of the Soviet leaders, which the Soviet peace delegates are defending and even promoting at this meeting. Because only by doing so can the people of all countries wage a victorious struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, defend universal peace and make peace triumph throughout the world.
    We are at a glorious time of great change in the world. We are witnessing the collapse of the shameful colonial and imperialist systems. The fierce blows of the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America have caused the US imperialism major losses and painful defeats. Independent African and Asian countries are making very positive contributions to international life.
    The people of all countries who are still suffering under colonial rule will not be fooled by the apologists for colonialism, who are trying to lead the people of all countries away from the struggle that is their international obligation, but on the contrary, the people of all countries are waging a heroic struggle. Our people have always been and will be the comrades-in-arms and sincere friends of the people of Africa, Asia and Latin America, who are fighting for freedom and national independence, which is their undeniable right and the foundation of correct relations between countries. The national liberation movement is a great factor for peace and progress. The national liberation movement will certainly eliminate the colonial system. The World Peace Council has an obligation to assist by all effective means the national liberation struggles in Oman, South Arabia, Angola, Southern Rhodesia, Mozambique and so-called Portuguese Guinea, North Kalimantan and Puerto Rico, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Swaziland and South West Africa, and strongly condemn the crimes of exterminating colored residents in South Africa and the United States.
    Today, many outstanding major issues make mankind uneasy and demand universal peace. The disarmament issue has been discussed for twenty years in a row, but to no avail. The Geneva Seventeen-Nation Committee has been continuing endless, fruitless meetings. The impression one gets is that these discussions are organized and deliberate, in order to cover up the arms race that is being conducted so feverishly and the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, Congo, and Dominica. It seems that the plan for complete and thorough disarmament has been shelved. The so-called "nuclear umbrella" nakedly exposes the plan of the United States and the Soviet Union to disarm other countries, while these two superpowers will retain rockets and nuclear weapons to threaten and conquer other countries. At present, they are putting the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the first place, which is not without a clear purpose. The fundamental idea of this plan is that nuclear weapons are the exclusive property of imperialists and the Soviet Union, and other countries must not possess these weapons, here West Germany is an exception, West Germany can possess nuclear weapons in the form of "multilateral nuclear force."
    Our delegation understands the concern caused by the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and of course we oppose handing over such weapons in any form to West Germany, which pursues a policy of revenge and aggression. But we believe that it is not right to raise this question in this way. The danger does not come from countries that do not have nuclear weapons, but from imperialist countries that have nuclear weapons. When the United States threatens to actually use nuclear weapons, putting the force on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation is to misdirect this issue and recognize the United States and the Soviet Union's power to monopolize nuclear weapons and conduct nuclear blackmail. We have consistently advocated universal and effective disarmament, and advocated the prohibition and complete and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. It is from this perspective that we consider the issue of nuclear non-proliferation.
    We advocate European security, but this is definitely not to turn this issue into a deceptive slogan, as the Soviet leaders have done. The Soviet leaders are pursuing a policy of appeasement in Europe, allowing U.S. imperialism to freely freeze the situation it currently controls in Europe, and after ensuring the flanks, shift the focus of global strategy to the East, where it concentrates its forces to wage war against the Vietnamese people, Indochina and People's China.
    Our delegation believes that, in the current situation, when the situation is very favorable to the people of all countries fighting for freedom and independence, the main goal of the world peace movement should be to establish an international anti-imperialist united front, a front as broad as possible, which will wage a resolute struggle to defend peace and oppose U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. This unified front for peace should be based on the militant unity of the people of all countries against the common enemy of peace, imperialism, and should not include the Soviet leadership group, the collaborators of U.S. imperialism, because they have placed themselves outside this unified front of international anti-imperialist forces for peace with their actions. We also believe that it is necessary to reject and oppose the various manipulations carried out by Soviet representatives in the world peace movement, the purpose of these activities is to force their surrender line into this movement that unites us, and to turn the World Peace Council into their tool.
    If the world peace movement is on this path, that is, maintaining the combat traditions it has had since its establishment, then it will become strong, effective, and able to shoulder the great and lofty obligations of opposing U.S. imperialism and its collaborators, defending and consolidating world peace, and making peace triumph throughout the world.

    阿尔巴尼亚代表在世界和理会上谴责苏联领导假援越真联美
    苏联投降政策帮助美帝战略东移反对中越人民
    国际反帝统一阵线不能包括美帝的合作者苏联领导集团在内
    新华社日内瓦十五日电　出席世界和平理事会会议的阿尔巴尼亚代表团团长法特米尔·吉亚泰十四日在全体会议上发言，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们和同志们：
    世界和平理事会会议是在人类进入了深刻的革命变革阶段的时刻举行的，侵略战争的战火笼罩着世界上许多国家的天空，许多国家的人民为和平、自由和民族尊严的事业，为反对帝国主义和反动派，而作出了巨大的牺牲。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民，在自由、民主和社会进步的崇高理想的鼓舞下，过去和现在都在再接再厉打碎帝国主义和殖民主义统治的锁链。一个没有压迫者和剥削的新世界诞生了，它的基础是和平、独立、国家主权和大小国家之间的平等这些原则。以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者这些旧世界的老爷们，起来反对这个新世界，他们把要求自由的任何国家的人民都看作敌人，把任何进步运动都看作是进行颠覆，妄图把自己的统治、压迫和掠夺扩及全世界，对为自由而斗争的刚果人民和世界各地人民发动野蛮的进攻，出动自己的军队去镇压多米尼加人民，在越南南方使用凝固汽油弹和毒气，夜以继日地轰炸越南民主共和国，在全世界遍设军事基地，把在国际上进行掠夺和使用暴力作为制度和天经地义的事。
    各国人民今天比以往任何时候更加认识到自己的力量和自己的权利，他们理所当然地认为美帝国主义是自己的最凶恶的敌人。各国人民再也不要什么主子，决不再受奴役。他们渴望和平，但这决不是在外国奴役之下的和平，因为没有自由就决不会有和平。他们要过自由和独立的生活，要建立自己所喜欢的制度，要做自己命运的主人，要根据自己的传统和愿望建设新的生活，并且在平等和互相尊重的情况下对人类所关心的一切问题作出自己的贡献。为了达到这个目的，他们正在加强团结互助，反对垂死的老殖民主义，反对正在代替老殖民主义而且更加狡猾和更加危险的美国殖民主义，反对帝国主义及其同伙的压制政策和侵略政策。
    在这种紧张的局势下，我们的世界和平运动必须毫不含糊和明确有力地重申它所据以建立的根本原则。如果在世界和平运动的宗旨中我们不开宗明义地提出帝国主义是战争的根源和主要的敌人这样一条本世纪的伟大真理，如果把一切斗争，甚至把各国人民的解放斗争都看作对和平是危险的，那么就很可能把帝国主义侵略者及其受害者相提并论，或者更坏，去接受美国政府的骗局——美国政府竭力企图造成这样的印象：它是所谓希望在越南实现和平的，而正在抗击侵略和为民族独立而斗争的越南人民要打仗！近几年来，各和平委员会的某些代表已经不再坚决维护我们在巴黎大会上制订的重大原则了，这些原则已成为一纸空文。
    为了使我们的运动回到它建立时的革命传统，世界和平运动必须粉碎帝国主义者的凶恶计划，必须挫败目的在于麻痹各国人民对帝国主义的警惕性的一切图谋，因为不这样就不能保卫和平。我们的运动不能背离它的主要目的，那就是激励各国人民为保卫和平和反对侵略行动而进行斗争，这个运动不应该去迎合一个国家的政治利益，而必须符合爱好和平的各国人民的利益。
    我们来这里开会，并不是为了通过一些决议和呼吁书，而是为了动员各国人民保持警惕，为反对帝国主义战争的根源和反对使和平受到威胁的侵略者而斗争。我们只有坚决站在反对帝国主义的立场上，才能实现各国人民对世界和平运动寄予的希望。
    在当前的形势下，各国人民和帝国主义之间的大搏斗的中心，无疑是越南战争。今天，美国把和平、自由和各国人民自决的前途不当一回事，向所有爱好自由的国家和人民挑战，同时也向世界和平运动挑战。付出重大牺牲的越南人民正在进行具有世界意义的英勇斗争，把最强大的帝国主义国家的手脚都打断了，显示了人民战争的巨大威力，并且再次表明，世界上任何力量都不能压倒为自由和民族独立的正义事业而斗争的人民。
    美帝国主义者——国际上的专业杀人犯——在越南进行着一场破坏一切的战争，他们实行种族灭绝，屠杀小学生和孕妇。这是对人类与和平犯下的滔天罪行，理所当然地激起各国人民的莫大愤怒，这种罪行是和平主义的欺骗所掩盖不了的。世界和平运动必须鼓动各国人民起来反对犯下这种罪行的刽子手，通过各种具体的群众性的行动来鼓动他们，而不是仅仅通过一些把人民引入歧途和导致在帝国主义者的讹诈面前妥协和投降的决议、呼吁书和请愿书。
    美帝国主义者只能在越南遭到不可避免的失败。越南人民必胜。他们的胜利是对我们争取和平的运动的最宝贵的贡献，因为他们打击美帝国主义，就是打击和平的主要敌人。各国人民削弱帝国主义的任何行动，都有利于和平和加强我们的运动，提高我们的运动在全世界人民心目中的威信。
    美国为了逃脱自己在越南的失败，提出了“和平谈判”的建议，竭力企图通过这种手法来取得他们在战场上得不到的胜利，这就是说，他们要永久占领越南南方，把越南分割为两部分。任何国家的人民，在遭受敌人侵略的情况下，都会象越南人民一样采取行动，决不会在侵略者撤离他们的国家之前接受“和平谈判”，要不然，就是投降，或者就是象希特勒在慕尼黑搞的那种和平，这种和平就是第二次世界大战的前奏。各国人民希望在越南恢复和平。越南人民更是希望恢复和平。但是，如果这种“和平谈判”的手法在越南得逞，美国的胃口就会更大，要把这种手法运用于世界上的其他国家。因此，在这种情况下，进行讨论的任何尝试都根本不利于和平事业，而是有利于侵略者。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民把越南人民为之斗争的事业看作是自己的事业。阿尔巴尼亚人民每时每刻都同他们的越南兄弟站在同一个战线上和同一个作战工事里，因为越南的敌人是全人类最凶恶的敌人。
    我们代表团相信，越南人民的真正朋友，自由和和平的真正朋友已经认识到，在这个对全面和平的目标极端重要的问题上，苏联领导人所作的反对干涉一些国家内政的纯理论上的讲话，不会有利于越南人民，而有利于侵略者。苏联领导人曾经多次声明，对一个社会主义国家进行侵略，就是对苏联的侵略。但是，他们做了些什么呢？他们为什么不帮助越南民主共和国呢？至少为什么不断绝他们同侵略者的关系呢？当一个政府承担了义务，当它拥有一切必要的手段并怀着真诚的意图的时候，它就必须喝令侵略者停止。苏联领导人为什么不这样做呢？理由很简单，在他们和美国政府之间已经拟订了一整条旨在在世界上建立共同霸权的新路线，因为对他们来说，美帝国主义不再是刽子手、压迫者和国际宪兵，而是“爱好和平”的“有理智的人”，因为，他们认为“任何星星之火都会引起热核战争”，因此，他们充当扑灭亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的一切解放运动的火焰的消防队员。苏联领导人在言论上表明他们是越南的朋友，进而表明他们反对美帝国主义，支持各国人民的解放运动，但是，他们的行动却表明他们是美国政府的合作者，按照他们的话来说，人们期望美国政府采取“走向改善世界政治气氛的一些真正步骤”，他们在谈论“同美国存在着非常广泛的合作天地”，“美国已经在认真考虑和平竞赛的呼吁”，甚至“美国已经准备把裁军节省下来的钱用于帮助各落后国家人民发展他们的经济和民族文化”。他们正在宣传威胁各国人民而有利于帝国主义殖民者的主张。根据这些主张，“殖民主义的根源已经消失”，而且“被压迫的国家和人民的头等义务不再是进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，而是争取发展国家经济和文化”。
    这些事实说明，他们正在同帝国主义进行竞赛的目的是要粉碎民族解放运动，要阻挠解放的国家加强民族独立，以达到他们能够亲自打入这些国家并建立新殖民主义的新统治。
    大家都知道刚果人民由于苏联领导人同美帝国主义者合作而付出的代价，苏联领导人和美帝国主义者在联合国的同意下用火来扑灭刚果人民的正义斗争。现在苏联领导人又在同美国讨论成立联合国常设武装部队，而这种部队只不过是镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民和其它各国人民的解放斗争的一支国际宪兵队。
    世界和平理事会必须呼吁各国人民谴责这些威胁着普遍和平的危险阴谋，呼吁各国工人、海员、妇女、青年采取具体行动来毫无保留地支持越南人民和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争，制止侵略者和揭露苏联领导人的投降和妥协政策，而苏联和平代表在这个会上为这种政策进行辩解，甚至进行宣传。因为，各国人民只有这样做，才能对以美国为首的帝国主义进行胜利的斗争，才能保卫普遍和平。
    我们正处在一个世界上发生巨大变化的光荣时代。我们正在亲眼看到可耻的殖民制度和帝国主义制度的崩溃。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的民族解放运动的猛烈打击，已使美帝国主义遭到重大损失和惨痛的失败。非洲和亚洲独立国家正在为国际生活作出十分积极的贡献。
    仍旧在殖民统治下受苦的各国人民，不会上殖民主义辩护士的当，这些人企图使各国人民背离作为他们国际义务的斗争，但是，相反地，各国人民正在进行着英勇斗争。我国人民过去一贯是，将来也将是非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的战友和真诚团结的朋友，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民正在为自由和民族独立而斗争，民族独立是他们不可争辩的权利，是各国之间正确关系的基础。民族解放运动是和平和进步的巨大因素。民族解放运动肯定将会消灭殖民制度。世界和平理事会的义务是以一切有效的措施来援助阿曼、南阿拉伯、安哥拉、南罗得西亚、莫三鼻给和所谓葡属几内亚、北加里曼丹和波多黎各、贝专纳、巴苏陀兰、斯威士兰和西南非的民族解放斗争，强烈地谴责在南非和美国灭绝有色居民的罪行。
    今天许多悬而未决的重大问题使人类感到不安，并要求普遍和平。裁军问题已经连续讨论了二十年，而毫无结果。日内瓦的十七国委员会始终在继续进行无止无休的、没有结果的会议。人们得到的印象是：这些讨论是有组织的，有用心的，是为了掩盖如此狂热进行的军备竞赛和美国在越南、刚果、多米尼加的侵略行动。看来全面彻底裁军计划已被搁置一边。所谓“原子保护伞”赤裸裸地暴露了美国和苏联要解除其他国家的武装的计划，然而这两个超级核大国将保留火箭和核武器，来威胁和征服其他国家。目前，它们把不扩散核武器问题放在第一位，这不是没有明确目的的。这个计划的根本思想是：核武器是帝国主义者和苏联垄断的专有物，其他国家不得拥有这些武器，在这里西德是例外，西德在“多边核力量”的形式下可以拥有核武器。
    我国代表团了解核武器扩散所引起的不安，当然我们反对以任何形式把这种武器交给奉行复仇主义和侵略政策的西德。但是我们认为，这样地提出这个问题，那是不对的。危险不来自没有核武器的国家，而来自拥有核武器的帝国主义国家。在美国威胁要真正使用核武器的时候，把力量放在核武器不扩散化这个问题上，那就是使这个问题迷失方向和承认美国和苏联有垄断核武器和进行核讹诈的权力。我们过去和现在一贯拥护普遍和有效的裁军，拥护禁止和全面彻底销毁核武器。我们正是从这个角度去考虑核武器非扩散化的问题。
    我们主张欧洲安全，但是这决不是为了把这个问题变成一句骗人的口号，就象苏联领导人所干的那样。苏联领导人在欧洲奉行姑息政策，让美帝国主义自由自在地冻结它目前控制着欧洲的局面，在侧翼有了保证之后，把全球战略的锋芒转移到东方，在那里集中兵力对越南人民、印度支那和人民中国进行战争。
    我国代表团认为，在目前情况下，在形势十分有利于争取自由和独立的各国人民的时候，世界和平运动的主要目标应该是建立一个国际反帝统一阵线，一个尽可能广泛的阵线，这个阵线为保卫和平和反对美帝国主义及其同伙进行坚决的斗争。这个和平统一阵线应该把反对帝国主义这个和平公敌的各国人民的战斗团结作为基础，不包括美帝国主义的合作者苏联领导集团在内，因为他们用自己的行动把自己置于这个国际反帝和平力量统一阵线之外。我们还认为，必须拒绝和反对苏联代表在世界和平运动中进行的各种操纵活动，这些活动的目的是要把他们的投降路线塞进这个把我们联合在一起的运动，并且要把世界和平理事会变成他们的工具。
    如果世界和平运动是这条道路，即保持从它建立时所具有的战斗传统，那么它将变得强大、有效，能够担当起反对美帝国主义及其合作者、保卫和巩固世界和平和使和平在全世界取得胜利的这些重大和崇高的义务。
