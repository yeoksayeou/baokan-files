    American Monopoly Capital Amasses Huge Fortune in the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    Editor's Note: The war of aggression against Vietnam has brought profound disasters to the American people. However, American monopoly capital has amassed a huge fortune from this war. The West German magazine *Die Zeit* recently published an article entitled "Who is Profiting from the Vietnam War," which revealed some of the ways in which the war of aggression against Vietnam fattened American monopoly capital. We are excerpting and translating this article, with annotations, as follows:
    It's like the gold rush fever in (American history): labor is extremely scarce and wages are extremely high, new enterprises are being established one after another, profits are growing faster and faster, and clever entrepreneurs and adventurous speculators can earn a fortune in a matter of weeks. (American monopoly capitalists have always made fortunes from wars; every dollar they earn is stained with blood. What Johnson meant when he said that "the national interest requires us to adhere to our current (aggressive) policy" was actually the interests of American monopoly capitalists.)
    The intensification of the war in Southeast Asia means the beginning of a great industrial boom on the west coast of the United States, and California managers frankly admit this. One of them admitted in an interview with *Newsweek*: "The economic results of escalation are the icing on the cake for us." (The Johnson administration's "escalation" policy was designed to progressively escalate the profits of American monopoly capitalists.)
    Norris-Thermador Corporation of Los Angeles cites figures stating that it ships 500,000 2.75-inch rockets and 40,000 bombs to Vietnam every month. In the last six months, this enterprise has increased its profits by approximately 155 percent.
    The profits of the aircraft industry are rising almost as fast as those of the munitions factories. United Aircraft Corporation announced that its profits for 1965 were 70 percent. (American imperialism is frantically expanding armaments across the board, and the war profits of American monopoly capital are growing larger and larger. However, the American ruling clique often pretends to talk about their "desire for disarmament." Modern revisionists also follow suit, vigorously advocating reaching a "disarmament agreement" with the United States. The American ruling clique is openly deceiving people, and modern revisionists are helping American imperialism to paralyze the people of the world.)
    But the Vietnam boom is by no means limited to the munitions industry. San Francisco's huge shipping industry is booming again for the first time since the Korean War: the Department of Defense has chartered more than 100 merchant ships, 87 of which are ships from the Liberty Shipbuilding Corporation that were "prepared for long-term disuse" after World War II.
    Airlines are also doing booming business, airlifting 220 tons of cargo to South Vietnam every day.
    Railway transport companies are working around the clock to transport supplies to West Coast ports, textile companies are providing 2.5 million pairs of military pants, and shoe factories have raised the sales price of shoes by 12 percent in just a few months. Because the Department of Defense commissioned an emergency order to provide 1.25 million pairs of military boots, all of these companies are "making a fortune in what is so far the most costly war the United States has waged." (The "cost" of sacrifices paid by the broad masses of working people allows a small handful of monopoly capitalists to make a fortune. This is one of the fundamental tasks of the governments of all imperialist countries. The most ferocious American imperialist Johnson government is doing it most frantically.)
    Even with very conservative estimates, one can draw the conclusion that it is possible to earn one million dollars a day in the Vietnam War, and it is very likely to be 1.5 million dollars. (What a great source of wealth, how can it be easily let go? Johnson's cry to "see it through to the end" lies in this.)
    The undeniable fact is that there are now "Vietnam millionaires," those who have made a fortune because of the war in Southeast Asia. This is true not only for manufacturers of munitions, but also for financiers who bet early on "real" stocks. It is not uncommon to earn 10 or 20 percent in a week in munitions stock trading. McDonnell Aircraft Corporation's stock price can rise by 90 percent in 100 days.
    The government's month-by-month increase in arms spending has stimulated the fantasies of many speculators. (It should be said that the will of American monopoly capitalists determines that the Johnson government will not only continue to follow the path of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, but will also never abandon its policy of aggression and war.)

### 美国垄断资本在侵越战争中大发横财

    美国垄断资本在侵越战争中大发横财
    编者按：侵越战争给美国人民带来了深重的灾难。但是，美国垄断资本却从这场战争中大发横财。西德《时代》周刊不久以前发表的题为《谁在越南战争中发财》的文章，透露了侵越战争怎样养肥了美国垄断资本的一些情况。现将这篇文章摘译并加批语发表如下：
    好象在（美国历史上）淘金热狂时期一样：劳动力奇缺而工资特高，新企业接连不断地建立起来，利润愈来愈快地增长，精明的企业家和冒险的投机家，在短短几星期之内就能赚到一笔财产。（美国垄断资本家从来就是靠战争发财的，他们所赚得的每一块美元都沾满了血迹。约翰逊说什么“国家的利益要求我们坚持目前的（侵越）政策”，他说的其实是美国垄断资本家的利益。）
    东南亚战争的加剧，意味着美国西部海岸工业大繁荣的开始，加利福尼亚的经理们老老实实地公开承认这一点。其中一个人在同《新闻周刊》的一次谈话中承认：“逐步升级的经济结果，对我们说来就是点心上的奶油。”（约翰逊政府的“逐步升级”政策，就是为了使美国垄断资本家的利润逐步升级。）
    洛杉矶的诺里斯—瑟马多军火公司列举数字说：它每月向越南输送五十万枚二点七五吋的火箭和四万颗炸弹。在最近六个月内，这个企业大约增加了百分之一百五十五的赢利。
    飞机工业的赢利上升速度几乎同军火工厂一样。联合飞机公司宣布一九六五年的赢利为百分之七十。（美帝国主义疯狂地全面扩军，美国垄断资本的战争利润越来越大。然而，美国统治集团却经常装模作样地谈论他们的“裁军愿望”。现代修正主义者也跟着大肆宣扬要同美国达成“裁军协议”。美国统治集团是在公开骗人，现代修正主义者是在帮助美帝国主义麻痹世界人民。）
    但是越南景气绝不仅仅局限于军火工业。旧金山的庞大的船舶运输业，自朝鲜战争以来第一次重新兴隆起来：国防部租用了一百多艘商船，其中八十七艘是第二次世界大战以后“准备长期不用的”自由造船公司的船。
    航空公司也生意兴隆，每天空运二百二十吨货物前往南越。
    铁路运输公司的货车日夜不停地将补给品运往西海岸的港口、纺织品公司提供二百五十万条军裤、制鞋工厂在短短数月之内就把鞋的出售价格提高了百分之十二。因为国防部委托了一项提供一百二十五万双军用靴的紧急订货，所有这些公司都在“美国迄今为止进行的一场代价最大的战争中发了财”。（要广大劳动人民付出牺牲的“代价”，让一小撮垄断资本家发财。这正是一切帝国主义国家的政府的根本任务之一。最凶恶的美帝国主义约翰逊政府做得最为疯狂。）
    即使作很保守的估计，人们还是可以得出这样的结论：在越南战争中每天可能赚一百万美元，而且还很可能是一百五十万美元。（好大一个财源，怎能轻易放过？约翰逊叫嚷要“干到底”，原因就在于此。）
    不可否认的事实是：现在有“越南百万富翁”，这就是那些由于东南亚战争而发了财的人。这种情况不仅对军火物资制造者来说是如此，而且对那些很早把赌注押在“真正”的股票上的金融家来说也是一样。在军火股票交易中一周就赚了百分之十或二十，这不是罕见的事。麦克唐奈尔飞机公司的股票行情在一百天之内就能上涨百分之九十。
    政府一月比一月增多的军火开支刺激了许多投机家的幻想。（应当说，美国垄断资本家的意旨，决定了约翰逊政府不但还要继续沿着扩大侵越战争的道路走下去，而且也永远不会放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策。）
