    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Jakarta: While carrying out large-scale massacres of revolutionary people, the Indonesian right-wing military regime is conducting large-scale purges throughout the country, accelerating its fascization.

    Following repeated calls from Nasution and Suharto, heads of the right-wing generals' clique, to intensify the "cleansing," a large-scale cleansing movement has been launched in all departments of state institutions and in the army, navy, and air force. In Jakarta and other parts of the country, large numbers of workers and military personnel have been accused of being involved in the "September 30th Movement" and have been dismissed, suspended, replaced, or even detained. According to Jakarta Radio on May 5, more than 35,000 employees have been dismissed from the railway enterprise alone, and 690 have been removed from their posts. *Harapan Kita* ("The Light of Hope") reported that more than 530 of the 5,000 employees of the Ministry of Manpower have been suspended. According to Antara News Agency, 499 people have been dismissed from the civil aviation sector. According to *Api Pantjasila* ("The Fire of Pantjasila"), by April of this year, 2,358 civil servants and teachers had been dismissed from government agencies in South Sumatra Province alone.

    The military authorities in some areas have also announced a ban on the activities of nationalist political parties. According to Jakarta Radio, the East Java Military Region and the South Sulawesi Military Region announced in May that they would ban the Indonesian Party and its affiliated mass organizations from operating in their respective areas.

    Recently, the right-wing military clique has further conspired to persecute all those who are deemed to have expressed dissatisfaction with the fascist tyranny. Jakarta Radio reported on May 21 that the right-wing military clique recently issued "Order No. 9 of 1966" in the name of "Crush Malaysia Command." This "order" stipulates that even those who express dissatisfaction with the cleansing "in speech or attitude" will be "subject to criminal punishment, including dismissal."

    The white terror of the right-wing military regime has made people working in government agencies, enterprises, and the armed forces uneasy. Antara News Agency revealed on May 18 that the cleansing carried out at the Halim Air Force Base in Jakarta had caused "widespread anxiety within the Air Force." A report in the May 23 issue of *Harapan Kita* revealed that tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs due to the cleansing, making the ranks of the unemployed even larger. The news quoted Manpower Minister Awaluddin as saying that there are now "approximately 3 million unemployed and 12 to 13 million underemployed people" in Indonesia. An earlier report by Agence France-Presse also pointed out that among the large numbers of people who flock to Jakarta from all over the country every day to make a living, many are women and children who have lost their husbands and fathers due to the persecution and massacres of the right-wing regime.

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The Indonesian right-wing military clique has successively released a large number of counter-revolutionary elements who were sentenced by the former Indonesian government in May.

    According to Jakarta Radio, Indonesian Attorney General Sugih Arto recently announced the release of a group of counter-revolutionary political prisoners who had committed serious crimes, including former cabinet minister Sultan Hamid, who colluded with Dutch colonialists against the Republic of Indonesia; Anak Agung, the prime minister of the former State of East Indonesia created by Dutch colonialists; Sukarni, the head of the Civilian Party and one of the heads of the anti-revolutionary organization "Organization to Support Sukarnoism" banned by the former Indonesian government; and the heads of the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party, known for their anti-communist and anti-people stances. Prior to this, Nasution and Suharto, heads of the right-wing generals' clique, had repeatedly delivered speeches calling for the immediate release of counter-revolutionary political prisoners.

    印尼右派军人政权加紧法西斯统治
    在全国军政机构企业部门大肆清洗，同时释放大批反革命分子
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权在大规模屠杀革命人民的同时，正在全国范围内大规模进行清洗，加速法西斯化。
    在右派将领集团头目纳苏蒂安、苏哈托一再叫嚷加紧进行“清洗”后，一个大规模的清洗运动在国家机构的各部门中和陆、海、空各军种中展开。在雅加达和全国其它地方，大批职工和军队成员被加上同“九月三十日运动有牵连”的罪名，被革职、停职、撤换甚至拘禁。据雅加达电台五月五日透露，仅在铁路企业中，就有三万五千多名职工被解除职务，有六百九十人被撤职。《希望之光报》透露，有五千名职工的人力部被停职的就有五百三十多人。据安塔拉通讯社透露，民用航空部门被解除职务的达四百九十九人。据《建国五项原则之火报》透露，到今年四月为止，仅在南苏门答腊省各地的政府机关中，就有二千三百五十八名公务人员和教师被革职。
    一些地方的军事当局，还宣布禁止民族主义政党的活动。据雅加达电台报道，东爪哇军区和南苏拉威西军区在五月间先后宣布禁止印度尼西亚党及其所属群众组织在当地活动。
    最近，右派军人集团更进一步阴谋迫害所有被认为是对法西斯暴政表示不满的人。雅加达电台五月二十一日报道，右派军人集团最近以“粉碎马来西亚司令部”的名义，发布了“一九六六年第九号命令”，这项“命令”规定，即使是“在言论上或者态度上”对清洗表示不满的人，也“将受刑事处分，包括被革职等处分”。
    右派军人政权的白色恐怖，使得在政权机构、企业和各军种中任职的人们惶惶不安。安塔拉通讯社五月十八日透露，在雅加达哈利姆空军基地进行的清洗，使“空军内部普遍产生了忧虑心情”。五月二十三日的《希望之光报》的消息透露，成千上万的人由于遭到清洗而失业，使失业队伍更加庞大。这则消息引用人力部长阿瓦卢丁的话说，现在印度尼西亚全国“大约有三百万人失业，半失业者有一千二百万到一千三百万人”。法新社早些时候的一则报道还指出，在每天从各地大量涌入雅加达谋生的人中，许多是因右派政权的迫害、屠杀而失去丈夫和父亲的妇女和儿童。
    新华社一日讯　印度尼西亚右派军人集团五月间陆续把大批被前印度尼西亚政府判刑的反革命分子释放出笼。
    据雅加达电台广播，印度尼西亚最高检察官苏吉·阿托最近宣布释放一批犯有严重罪行的反革命政治犯，其中有勾结荷兰殖民主义者反对印度尼西亚共和国的前内阁部长苏丹·哈米德，荷兰殖民主义者制造的前东印度尼西亚邦总理阿纳克·阿贡，平民党头子、被前印度尼西亚政府禁止的反革命组织“支持苏加诺主义机构”头目之一苏卡尼，以及以反共反人民著称的马斯友美党和社会党的头目等。在这以前，右派将领集团头目纳苏蒂安和苏哈托一再发表讲话，叫嚷要立即释放反革命政治犯。
