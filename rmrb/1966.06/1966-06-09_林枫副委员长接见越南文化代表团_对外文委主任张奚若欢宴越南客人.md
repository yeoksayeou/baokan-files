    Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, received all members of the Vietnamese Cultural Delegation led by Pham Ngoc Thuan, Director of the Vietnamese Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, this afternoon and held cordial and friendly talks with them.

    Present at the reception were Zhang Xiruo, Chen Zhongjing, Li Qitao, Li Qi, Cao Keqiang, and other responsible persons from relevant departments.

    Hoang Bac, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, was also present.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 8th: Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Vietnamese Cultural Delegation led by Pham Ngoc Thuan, Director of the Vietnamese Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the banquet.

    Zhang Xiruo spoke at the banquet. He warmly praised the heroic Vietnamese people for achieving one brilliant victory after another in their struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism. He said that the struggle of the Vietnamese people tells us: "The deepest source of the great power of war lies in the masses of the people." The masses are the real bronze wall and iron bastion, and as long as they persevere in the struggle, all demons and monsters will be eliminated.

    Zhang Xiruo condemned U.S. imperialism for expanding its aggression and engaging in "peace talks" conspiracies in order to save itself from its utter defeat in Vietnam. He said that modern revisionism, centered on the leadership of the CPSU, which flies the banner of "Aid Vietnam and resist America," is actively cooperating with U.S. imperialism to promote the "peace talks" fraud. However, the Vietnamese people, who have been tested by long revolutionary struggles, cannot be intimidated or deceived.

    He said, we believe that through the visit of the Vietnamese Cultural Delegation, it will definitely make beneficial contributions to strengthening cultural exchanges between the two countries, to closely coordinating Sino-Vietnamese cultural cooperation with the cause of anti-American struggle, and to enhancing the fighting friendship between the people of China and Vietnam.

    Zhang Xiruo said that at present, our country is in a great upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a life-and-death class struggle between socialism and capitalism, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The entire Chinese people are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fiercely counterattacking the bourgeois anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. The entire Chinese people will unswervingly, completely, cleanly, and thoroughly sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    Zhang Xiruo said that the people of China and Vietnam are close comrades-in-arms and brothers who share life and death and go through thick and thin together. The Chinese people will support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation wholeheartedly and at any cost, and contribute our strength to thoroughly defeating U.S. imperialism.

    Head of Delegation Pham Ngoc Thuan said in his speech that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, headed by the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have established an independent and complete economic system and achieved tremendous achievements in all aspects. Five hundred million Chinese peasants are self-reliantly building a new socialist countryside.

    He said that Vietnam and China are as closely related as lips and teeth, with mountains connecting mountains and rivers connecting rivers. The hearts of the people of Vietnam and China are linked together in the cause of national independence and socialist construction of our two countries. Under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh and the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, we support each other and fight shoulder to shoulder in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and the fighting friendship between the people of the two countries is growing stronger day by day. He said that in particular, the Vietnamese people have received the wholehearted support of the Chinese people in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle, and the Vietnamese people regard China as a strong rear area.

    Pham Ngoc Thuan said that on the basis of the strong and unbreakable friendship between Vietnam and China, cultural cooperation between the two countries is also developing continuously. We hope that through this visit, we will further strengthen the fighting friendship between the people of Vietnam and China, and strengthen cultural exchanges and the cause of anti-American struggle between the two countries.

    Hoang Bac, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, was invited to attend the banquet.

    Also present at the banquet were Chen Zhongjing, Li Qitao, Li Qi, Yan Baizhen, Cao Keqiang, Sun Xiaocun, and other responsible persons from relevant departments. (Attached picture)

    据新华社八日讯　对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若今晚举行宴会，欢迎由越南对外文化联络委员会主任范玉纯率领的越南文化代表团。人大常委会副委员长林枫出席了宴会。
    张奚若在宴会上讲话。他热情赞扬英雄的越南人民，在抗击美帝国主义的侵略斗争中，取得了一个又一个光辉的胜利。他说，越南人民的斗争告诉我们：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”，群众是真正的铜墙铁壁，只要坚持斗争，一切魔鬼通通会被消灭。
    张奚若谴责美帝国主义为了挽救在越南彻底失败的命运，一面扩大侵略，一面玩弄“和谈”阴谋。他说，打着“援越反美”旗号的以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义，积极配合美帝国主义推行“和谈”骗局。但是，久经革命斗争考验的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。
    他说，我们相信，通过越南文化代表团的访问，定将为加强两国文化交流，为使中越文化合作密切配合抗美斗争事业，为增强中越两国人民的战斗友谊，做出有益的贡献。
    张奚若说，当前，我国正处在一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮。这是社会主义同资本主义、马克思列宁主义同修正主义的你死我活的一场阶级搏斗。全中国人民正高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向资产阶级反党反社会主义的黑线猛烈反击。全中国人民将坚定不移地全部、干净、彻底地横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，将伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    张奚若说，中越两国人民是同生死、共患难的亲密战友和兄弟，中国人民不惜任何代价，任何牺牲，全心全意支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为彻底打败美帝国主义贡献自己的力量。
    范玉纯团长在讲话中说，中国人民在以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和政府的领导下，建立了独立完整的经济体系，在各方面取得了巨大的成就。五亿中国农民正在自力更生地建设社会主义新农村。
    他说，越中两国唇齿相依，山连山，水连水，越中两国人民心连心的在我们两国民族独立和社会主义建设事业中，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在抗美救国的斗争中，互相支持，并肩战斗，两国人民的战斗友谊日益加强。他说，特别是越南人民在抗美救国斗争中得到中国人民全心全意的支持，中国人民把越南人民的斗争当成自己的斗争，越南人民把中国当成强大的后方。
    范玉纯说，在越中两国坚强的牢不可破的友谊基础上，两国文化合作也在不断发展。我们希望通过这次访问，将进一步加强越中两国人民的战斗友谊，加强两国文化交流和抗美斗争的事业。
    越南驻中国大使馆临时代办黄北应邀出席了宴会。
