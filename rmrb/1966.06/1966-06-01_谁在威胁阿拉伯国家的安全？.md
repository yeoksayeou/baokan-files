    Who is Threatening the Security of Arab Countries?
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    U.S. imperialism is once again threatening and provoking the Arab people. Recently, the United States has provided Israel with a large amount of weapons, including fighter jets and heavy tanks. U.S. imperialism is once again creating tension in the Middle East, threatening the security of Arab countries. The people of Arab countries have expressed strong indignation and serious protest against this provocative action by U.S. imperialism.

    This action by U.S. imperialism is very serious for Arab countries. This is the largest direct provision of a large number of weapons to Israel by the United States. The United States has become the main supplier of military equipment to Israel. The U.S. government provides Israel with a large amount of American-style weaponry, especially combat aircraft. Its purpose is obviously to prepare for an aggression against Arab countries. As Arab newspapers pointed out, this "is a challenge to the Arabs."

    For a long time, U.S. imperialism has regarded Israel as a major tool for aggression and attack against the Arab people, and has continuously supported Israeli Zionists economically and militarily. In the past, U.S. imperialism directly or indirectly, through West German militarists, continuously delivered American-made weapons to Israel. In February of this year, the United States had already provided Israel with tanks. At that time, the U.S. government pretended to declare that the U.S. policy in the Near East was to try its best to "avoid becoming a major supplier of weapons." However, now the U.S. government is blatantly shipping a large number of weapons to Israel. This has torn off the thin veil of U.S. imperialism, exposing its hideous face of extreme hostility towards the Arab people.

    Through the practice of their anti-imperialist struggle, the people of Arab countries are fully capable of recognizing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialists often dress themselves up as "friends" of Arab countries in order to deceive the people of Arab countries. But the fact is that this so-called "friend" not only greedily plunders the wealth of Arab countries, but also carries out subversion and aggression against Arab countries. It also uses Israel as a sharp knife to stab the heart of Arab countries, causing constant threats to the peace and security of Arab countries. Therefore, the Arab people deeply understand that they must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism. Opposing U.S. imperialism, this vicious enemy, must be a major task in the struggle of the Arab countries to win and safeguard national independence.

    However, there are now people desperately serving the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade Arab countries, vigorously promoting the so-called "Tashkent spirit," advocating Arab-Israeli "reconciliation," and realizing "peaceful coexistence." This conspiracy has been seen through by the Arab people. Arab public opinion has pointed out that Washington's support for this so-called "Tashkent spirit," and wanting Arab countries to sign a Tashkent-style agreement with Israel, is tantamount to taking a lenient attitude towards robbery and invasion. Now, U.S. imperialism has delivered a large number of weapons such as fighter jets to Israel, which has further sharpened the eyes of the Arab people. The living facts show that those who try their best to get the Arab people to shake hands and make peace with the invading robbers can only be accomplices and henchmen of the robbers. The Arab people will never be fooled.

    The Chinese people and the Arab people are loyal comrades-in-arms in the anti-imperialist struggle. In the struggle of the Arab people against U.S. imperialism and its aggressive tool Israel, the Chinese people stand firmly on the side of the Arab people. We believe that any aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism and its tool Israel will be defeated by the united Arab people.

    谁在威胁阿拉伯国家的安全？
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义又向阿拉伯人民进行威胁和挑衅了。最近，美国又给以色列提供大量武器，包括战斗机和重型坦克。美帝国主义再一次在中东地区制造紧张局势，使阿拉伯国家的安全受到了威胁。阿拉伯各国人民对美帝国主义的这一挑衅行动，表示强烈的愤慨和严正的抗议。
    美帝国主义的这一行动，对于阿拉伯国家来说，是十分严重的。这是美国最大一次直接向以色列提供大量武器。美国已经成为以色列军事装备的主要供应者。美国政府向以色列提供大量的美式武器装备，尤其是提供作战飞机，其目的，显而易见的是为了准备对阿拉伯国家发动侵略。正如阿拉伯国家的报纸所指出，这“是对阿拉伯人的挑战”。
    长期以来，美帝国主义一直把以色列作为侵略和进攻阿拉伯人民的一个主要工具，不断地从经济上和军事上扶植以色列犹太复国主义者。美帝国主义过去曾经直接地或者间接地假西德军国主义者之手，源源地把美制武器交给以色列。今年二月，美国就已向以色列提供过坦克。当时美国政府还装模作样地宣称，美国在近东的政策是要竭力“避免成为武器的主要供应国家”。但是，现在美国政府又明目张胆地向以色列运送大量武器。这就揭下了美帝国主义的一层薄薄的面纱，暴露出了它极端敌视阿拉伯人民的狰狞嘴脸。
    阿拉伯各国人民通过自己反帝斗争的实践，完全能够认清美帝国主义的侵略本性。美帝国主义者经常把自己打扮成阿拉伯国家的“朋友”，以欺骗阿拉伯各国人民。但事实是，这个所谓“朋友”，不仅贪婪地掠夺阿拉伯国家的财富，并且对阿拉伯国家进行着颠覆和侵略活动。它还利用以色列这把尖刀刺向阿拉伯国家的心脏，使阿拉伯国家的和平和安全遭受到经常的威胁。因此，阿拉伯人民深刻地懂得，绝不能对美帝国主义抱有任何不切实际的幻想。反对美帝国主义这个凶恶的敌人，不能不是阿拉伯各国人民争取和维护民族独立斗争中的重大任务。
    但是，现在竟有人拼命为美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋效劳，大肆宣扬什么“塔什干精神”，鼓吹阿拉伯—以色列“和解”，实现“和平共处”。这种阴谋诡计，已经为阿拉伯人民所识破。阿拉伯国家的舆论纷纷指出：华盛顿支持这种所谓“塔什干精神”，要阿拉伯国家同以色列之间签订塔什干式的协定，就等于是对抢劫和入侵罪行采取宽恕态度。现在，美帝国主义把战斗机等大量武器送交以色列，使阿拉伯人民进一步擦亮了眼睛。活生生的事实说明，那些千方百计地要阿拉伯人民去同侵略强盗握手言欢的人，只能是强盗的同伙和帮凶。阿拉伯人民是决不会上当的。
    中国人民和阿拉伯人民是反帝斗争的忠实战友。在阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争中，中国人民坚定不移地站在阿拉伯人民一边。我们相信，美帝国主义及其工具以色列的任何侵略活动，都将被团结起来的阿拉伯人民所击败。
