    We, the 470 teachers and students, felt extremely excited after hearing the Party Central Committee's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee on the evening of the 3rd from the radio. This decision spoke what was in our hearts and expressed the urgent demands and common aspirations of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The students could not restrain their inner excitement and unanimously believed that this was a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of the Socialist Cultural Revolution! We are extremely indignant at the anti-Party crimes of some of the main responsible persons of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. They controlled the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and tried every possible means to implement the revisionist line, confronting Mao Zedong Thought. They also shouted that young students should be both red and expert, but in reality, they told us to bury ourselves in our studies, delve into books, and take the road to become famous and become experts, attempting to lure young people to become successors of the bourgeoisie. They are daydreaming! Revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought have red hearts and sharp eyes, and will never be fooled by them. In a few dozen days, we will graduate. We resolutely obey the Party's assignment, go to the most needed and most arduous places in the motherland, resolutely take the road of intellectuals' laborization and revolutionization, and absolutely do not take the evil road of bourgeois scholars "authorities". Through these months of internship, we deeply feel that the broad masses of miners have infinite love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and infinite faith in and worship of Mao Zedong Thought. They have a firm stand, clear banners, keen sense, and sharp eyes. We must resolutely join them, closely follow the Party Central Committee and closely follow Chairman Mao. Wherever the Party points, we will strike there. Even if it means climbing mountains of knives or plunging into seas of fire, we will wage a resolute struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end!

    我们紧跟党紧跟毛主席
    我们坚决走知识分子劳动化革命化的道路，决不走资产阶级所谓“学者”“权威”的邪路
    我们四百七十名师生三日晚从广播中听到党中央关于改组北京市委的决定后，感到无比兴奋。这个决定说出了我们的心里话，表达了广大工农兵的迫切要求和共同愿望。同学们抑制不住内心的激动，一致认为这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是社会主义文化大革命的伟大胜利！我们对前北京市委一些主要负责人反党罪行万分愤慨，他们把持北京市委，千方百计贯彻修正主义路线，与毛泽东思想对抗。他们也喊青年学生要又红又专，实际上叫我们埋头业务，钻进书堆，走成名成家的道路，企图把青年诱去当资产阶级接班人。他们这是白日做梦！用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青年心红眼亮，决不会上他们的当。再过几十天我们就要毕业了。我们坚决服从党的分配，到祖国最需要最艰苦的地方去，坚决走知识分子劳动化革命化的道路，决不走资产阶级学者“权威”的邪路。通过这几个月的实习，我们深深体会到广大矿工师傅对党中央毛主席无限热爱，对毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限崇拜，他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，嗅觉灵敏，眼睛雪亮。我们要坚决与他们一道，紧跟党中央紧跟毛主席，党指向哪里，我们就打到哪里，哪怕上刀山下火海，我们也要与反党反社会主义黑帮进行坚决斗争，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把社会主义文化革命进行到底！
