Albanian people deeply love Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as a great Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought has great significance for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

The Albanian people highly praise Chairman Mao for his great historical achievements in developing Marxism-Leninism theory in a genius, creative, and comprehensive manner. Writer Qulakuqi said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the undisputed banner of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong has formulated strategies and tactics for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and his works are also programmatic documents for the construction of communism." Famous literary critic Bixiku said: "Comrade Mao Zedong is a great thinker. He has made significant contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of socialist revolution and socialist construction." Soldier Tonuzi said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the great thought of a great people's leader. The historical experience summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong in his works is a great contribution to the revolutionary people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring the oppressed people of the world to fight against imperialism and for national liberation. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat all enemies."

The Albanian people express their reverence for Chairman Mao with enthusiastic words. The Party Committee Secretary of a petroleum enterprise, Viladi Tohuqi, said: "I particularly admire Chairman Mao. In the film 'Long Live the Victory of People's War,' I saw Chairman Mao wearing patched clothes and working in a cave during the War of Resistance Against Japan. But it was in those difficult years that he pointed out that victory belongs to the Chinese people. In the early days of the War of Liberation, facing the reactionary Kuomintang, which was backed by American imperialism and had several million troops, Chairman Mao again put forward the brilliant proposition that 'imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.' This proposition, full of revolutionary optimism, has even greater practical guiding significance today." The philosophy teacher at the "Lenin" Party School, Spasiu, said: "We fervently love Comrade Mao Zedong because he belongs not only to China but also to Albania, to the entire international communist movement, and to all progressive humanity."

In addition to studying the works of their beloved leader Comrade Hoxha, the Albanian people also pay attention to studying Chairman Mao's works. Albanian comrades often say with boundless affection that Comrade Mao Zedong's works are books that everyone must read and that they cannot put down. The head of the philosophy teaching department at the University of Tirana said: "The experience of Chinese socialist revolution and socialist construction summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong has great significance not only for China but also for the whole world. Mao Zedong's works and Mao Zedong Thought have far exceeded the borders of China and have great significance for the entire international communist movement and the whole world. The more we study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, the more we admire Comrade Mao Zedong's great contributions to the world revolution. In our teaching, we regard Chairman Mao's works as required reading. For example, in our philosophy courses, we list more than twenty works by Chairman Mao, such as 'On Contradiction,' 'On Practice,' and 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,' as required reading."

Famous Albanian physicist Kelezi said: "We are scientists, but first of all, we should be revolutionaries. To become a revolutionary, one must read Chairman Mao's works. We are in a new great revolutionary era. This era requires us to pay special attention to reading Chairman Mao's works. I particularly like to read Chairman Mao's works. His works have clear viewpoints, deep and comprehensive analysis. Especially Comrade Mao Zedong's work 'On Contradiction,' which develops dialectical materialism, can be used to correctly understand political, economic, military, cultural, educational, and international issues. From Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we can not only find the correct direction but also obtain the correct methods to solve problems." University of Tirana student Fino said, "Chairman Mao is not only a great theorist but also a great revolutionary. Albanian students all love to read Chairman Mao's works because Mao Zedong Thought can educate our young generation to become good Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries."

Chairman Mao's military works are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Albanian People's Army. Army officer Cheqashi said: "Comrade Mao Zedong has developed the military theory of Marxism-Leninism and enriched the Marxist-Leninist military science treasury. His military thought helps us improve our military command art." A commander of a certain unit in the army, Peqi, said: "The Albanian People's Army attaches great importance to mastering Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war. This thought has guiding significance for Albanian military construction. The Party of Labor of Albania, based on the thought of people's war, implements universal armament and strengthens preparedness, so although our country is small and is surrounded and blockaded by imperialism and revisionism, we firmly believe that we are invincible." Soldier Tonuzi said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's works are books loved by the broad masses of soldiers in Albania. The teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong Thought inspire the revolutionary fighting spirit and the spirit of devotion to the motherland of our soldiers in the People's Army, and enhance our unlimited confidence in defeating the enemy."

Chairman Mao's speeches and articles on literature and art have been highly praised by Albanian literary and art workers and have become theoretical weapons for literary criticism. Albanian writer Qulakuqi, when talking about Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,' pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Lenin's principle of the party nature of literature in this speech. The principles he proposed in this speech are not only meaningful for China but are universal truths. Chairman Mao pointed out that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and literary and art workers should integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not only to obtain the source of creation from them but also to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers to establish and consolidate their Marxist worldview. "Comrade Mao Zedong's words have greatly helped me and taught us to go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and into practice." Literary critic Bixiku pointed out: "This speech is full of profound revolutionary spirit and is of great help to Albanian literary and art workers. After we are armed with Comrade Mao Zedong's views, we can strongly criticize feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionist literature and art."

The broad masses of the Albanian people also sincerely praise the vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China for launching a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The Party Committee Secretary of the Tropoja District, Dupmishi, said: "The vast masses of workers and peasants in China studying Chairman Mao's works and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is a great thing. We have seen that in China, Mao Zedong Thought has become the wealth of the people, and once it is mastered by the masses, it becomes a great material force. To become a revolutionary, one must study Comrade Mao Zedong's works because Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the way forward for all revolutionaries." Viladi Tohuqi said: "Every day I hear and see on the radio and in the newspapers the heroism shown by the Chinese people in socialist construction and the great achievements and tremendous successes they have achieved, so we see the flowers that Mao Zedong Thought has blossomed and the fruits it has borne."

    阿尔巴尼亚人民颂扬毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地发展了马列主义
    毛泽东同志是当代马列主义当之无愧的旗手
    用毛泽东思想武装起来就能够战胜一切敌人
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心爱戴毛泽东主席，热情赞颂毛主席是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想对中国革命和世界革命具有伟大的意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民高度颂扬毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地发展马克思列宁主义理论的伟大历史功绩。作家古拉库契说：“毛泽东同志不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，同时也是当代马克思列宁主义当之无愧的旗手。毛泽东同志为社会主义革命和社会主义建设制定了战略和策略，他的著作也是共产主义建设的纲领性文件。”著名文艺批评家比希库说：“毛泽东同志是一个伟大的思想家。他对发展马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论作出了重大的贡献。”人民军战士托努齐说：“毛泽东思想是伟大的人民领袖的伟大思想。毛泽东同志在他的著作中所总结的历史经验是对世界革命人民的巨大贡献。毛泽东思想正在鼓舞全世界被压迫人民为反对帝国主义、争取民族解放而战斗。用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能战胜一切敌人。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民用热情的话语表达他们对毛主席的崇敬心情。一家石油企业的劳动党党委书记维莱迪·托胡齐说：“我特别敬佩毛主席。在《人民战争胜利万岁》影片中，我看到毛主席在抗日战争时期穿着带补钉的衣服，住在窑洞里工作。但是就在那些困难的年代里，他指出胜利属于中国人民。在解放战争初期，面对着受到美帝国主义扶植的、拥有几百万军队的蒋介石反动派，毛主席又提出了‘帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎’的英明论断。这个充满革命乐观主义精神的论断今天更具有现实的指导意义。”阿尔巴尼亚“列宁”党校哲学教员斯巴修说：“我们热烈爱戴毛泽东同志，因为他不仅属于中国，而且也属于阿尔巴尼亚，属于整个国际共产主义运动和整个进步人类。”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民除精心钻研自己敬爱的领袖霍查同志的著作外，也注意学习毛泽东主席的著作。阿尔巴尼亚同志常常怀着无限的深情说，毛泽东同志的著作是人人必读的书，是我们手不释卷的书。地拉那大学哲学教研室主任说：“由毛泽东同志所总结的中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验不仅对中国、而且对全世界都有伟大的意义。毛泽东的著作、毛泽东思想已大大超越了中国国界，对整个国际共产主义运动、对全世界都有伟大的意义。我们越学习毛泽东同志的著作，越加敬佩毛泽东同志对世界革命作出的巨大贡献。我们在教学中把毛主席著作作为必读文件。例如，我们在教哲学课时，把毛主席的《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等二十多篇著作列为必读文件。”
    阿尔巴尼亚著名物理学家凯莱齐说：“我们是科学家，但首先应当是革命者。要想成为革命者，必须读毛主席著作。我们正处在一个新的伟大的革命的时代。这个时代要求我们特别注意读毛主席著作。我特别爱读毛主席著作。他的著作的观点明确，分析深刻、全面。尤其是毛泽东同志的《矛盾论》这部著作，发展了辩证唯物主义，用它可以正确地认识政治、经济、军事、文化、教育、国际等一切问题。我们从毛泽东同志的著作中不仅可以找到正确的方向，而且还可以得到正确解决问题的方法。”地拉那大学学生菲诺说，“毛主席不仅是一个伟大的理论家，而且是一个伟大的革命家。阿尔巴尼亚学生都爱读毛主席的著作，因为毛泽东思想可以教育我们年青一代的人成为一个好的马克思列宁主义者，成为一个革命者。”
    毛主席的军事著作受到阿尔巴尼亚人民军广大指战员的热烈欢迎。人民军干部切查希说：“毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义的军事学说，丰富了马克思列宁主义的军事科学宝库。他的军事思想帮助我们提高军事指挥艺术。”人民军某部指挥员佩奇说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民军很重视掌握毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想。这一思想对于阿尔巴尼亚军事建设具有指导意义。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党根据人民战争的思想，实行全民武装，加强战备，因此，我们国家虽小，并且处在帝国主义和修正主义的包围和封锁之中，但我们坚信，我们是不可战胜的”。人民军战士托努齐说：“毛泽东同志的著作是阿尔巴尼亚广大战士热爱的书。恩维尔·霍查同志的教导和毛泽东思想鼓舞了我们人民军战士的革命斗志和为祖国献身的精神，增强了战胜敌人的无限信心。”
    毛泽东主席论文学艺术的讲话和文章在阿尔巴尼亚文艺工作者中受到了高度赞扬，并且成为文学批评的理论武器。阿尔巴尼亚作家古拉库契在谈到毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》时指出，毛泽东同志在这篇讲话中创造性地发展了列宁关于文学的党性原则。他在这篇讲话中所提出的原则不仅对中国有意义，而且是放之四海而皆准的真理。毛主席指出，文艺要为工农兵服务，文艺工作者要同工农兵相结合，不但从他们那儿获得创作的源泉，而且要向工农兵学习，建立并巩固自己的马克思主义的世界观。“毛泽东同志的这些话对我帮助很大，教导我们深入工农兵群众，深入实际。”文艺批评家比希库指出：“这篇讲话充满了深刻的革命精神，对阿尔巴尼亚文艺工作者是莫大的帮助。我们用毛泽东同志的观点武装以后就可以有力地批判那些封建主义、资产阶级、修正主义的文艺。”
    阿尔巴尼亚广大人民还衷心赞扬中国广大工农兵群众掀起活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。劳动党特罗波亚区委书记杜普米希说：“中国工农兵群众学习毛主席著作、掌握毛泽东思想是件了不起的大事。我们已经看到，在中国，毛泽东思想已经变成人民的财富，它一旦被群众所掌握，就化为巨大的物质力量。为了成为一个革命者，就必须学习毛泽东同志的著作，因为毛泽东思想为一切革命者照亮了前进的道路。”维莱迪·托胡齐说：“我每天从广播中和报纸上听到和看到中国人民在社会主义建设中所表现的英雄主义和建立的丰功伟绩以及他们所取得的巨大成就，这样，我们就看到了毛泽东思想所开出的鲜花，所结出的硕果。”
