    The Masses Are the True Authority
　　Su Deyi, Five-Good Worker, "March 8th" Red Banner Holder, Technician at Shanghai Glass Factory
    Who is the real authority in the three great revolutionary movements? In participating in the trial production of a new type of product – micro glass beads – I personally experienced that the masses are the true authority.

    Smashing the Habitual Forces of Dependence on Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Micro glass beads are extremely small round beads, only as thick as a strand of hair. Viewed under a microscope magnified 300 times, they are only as large as a soybean. This type of glass bead is a new type of glass product, currently manufactured by only a few countries. These glass beads are very useful and needed by industries such as textile, chemical, pharmaceutical, mechanical and electrical, and dye industries. Under the leadership of the Party, and with the cooperation of more than twenty units including the August First Film Studio, Shanghai Light Industry School, and Shanghai Light Industry Research Institute, we completed the trial production of this new product in just ten months.
    The birth of micro glass beads is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a victory achieved by greatly smashing superstition towards so-called "authorities" and "experts," humbly seeking advice from worker comrades, and closely integrating with them.
    In the past, the so-called "authorities" and "experts" in my mind had an image: they could read many "books," and often published papers in academic journals. As for what role these papers they published and their activities played in the three great revolutionary movements, I didn't think much about it. Anyway, I thought these "experts" and "authorities" were the most capable and the most remarkable.
    In 1964, shortly after I graduated from school and came to the factory, the leadership asked me to participate in the trial production of micro glass beads. Although I had learned some knowledge about glass manufacturing in university, I had not learned about the manufacturing of this kind of micro glass bead in school. This kind of glass bead had to be small, and also transparent, without containing even a trace of bubbles and impurities, and when placed in acid and alkali, it was also required not to deteriorate. How to manufacture it, there was no data, not even a sample could be found. Therefore, after accepting this task, I was very excited, very happy, and also felt very difficult. Therefore, I naturally thought that it would be best to have such a so-called "expert" in micro glass beads for me to consult, and such a so-called "authority" for me to rely on, so that we could produce it faster. Later, the "authority" was not found, and I became somewhat daunted, and dared not take on this heavy responsibility.
    The leadership saw what was on my mind and encouraged me, saying that although glass beads are small, their political significance is great. Whether or not to make glass beads is not only a scientific experiment issue, but also a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and revisionism. In particular, there were two things that made us furious when we heard them. In 1960, Chinese glass experts went to a country ruled by a revisionist group. Hearing that they had a factory producing glass beads, we wanted to visit it, but they wouldn't let us see it. We also heard that a factory in Shanghai imported a machine from an imperialist country, but only gave a small two bottles of glass beads. Once the glass beads were used up, a large amount of U.S. dollars had to be spent to buy another machine in order to get two more bottles of glass beads. Foreign capitalists were strangling us like this, bullying us. After hearing this, I was as angry as everyone else. I thought: these guys are too bullying! We Chinese people have ambition, we must make it ourselves and win this point.
    Who knew that when I made up my mind, an old worker had already taken action and used existing simple equipment to fire a small bottle of glass beads. Although these glass beads did not look round under the microscope, some looked like winter melons, and some looked like eggplants, but this matter touched me greatly. Why didn't this old worker think of relying on any "experts" or "authorities"? Why did he dare to break through? With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao's teachings enhanced my understanding. The old worker was wholeheartedly for the revolution, he could be anxious about what the Party was anxious about, he had no personal considerations, no constraints, dared to practice, and dared to take on heavy responsibilities.

          Worker Masses Are the Real Authority
    One of the important keys to the trial production of micro glass beads is to build a furnace. I copied the electrically heated furnace mentioned in the books, thinking that this would have a high temperature, be easy to control, and be clean. However, after building two in succession, they were both burned out in a few days, and the effect was not good. After dozens of experiments, they all failed. We held a meeting to analyze the situation. The worker comrades said that to make glass beads round, a gas furnace must be used.
    To design a gas furnace, although I had studied glass and porcelain in university, I could not come up with a solution. What to do? At first, I wanted to find the structure diagram of the furnace from the books I had read, but I couldn't find the kind of furnace we needed after flipping through them.
    I consulted Chairman Mao's writings and studied "On Practice" again. Chairman Mao said: "... those who have true knowledge are the people engaged in practice throughout the world." After reading this sentence, I thought that I had not built a furnace myself, but many veteran masters had been building furnaces and firing furnaces every day for decades, and they must be the most capable in furnaces. I should put down my airs and humbly ask them for advice. The fact is exactly like this. I went to ask the veteran masters for advice with the workshop engineer. After they heard our requirements for building the furnace, they thought for a while and built a model with bricks on the spot for us to see. The gas furnace that I could not find in the book was built by them. This touched me greatly: I had read a lot of books and flipped through a lot of books, but I couldn't come up with a solution, but they "built" it after just hearing the requirements, they really had a way. I thought I really had to put down my airs and rely on the masses in the future.
    However, in this process, the two thoughts of whether to believe in the so-called "authority" or believe in the worker comrades were constantly fighting in my mind. After the veteran masters "built" the model, they said to me: "This is for reference, you can see what the book says." The veteran masters were very modest. But I thought: the things "built" on the ground may not be "scientific" and may not be "reliable." Therefore, I locked myself in the room to process and design. The veteran masters proposed that only two combustion chambers were needed, but I was afraid that the furnace temperature would not be reached, so I doubled it and designed it into four combustion chambers. The veteran masters proposed to make a square furnace, I thought, how ugly to make a square cylinder, so I drew a round one. After the sketch was drawn, I took it to the veteran master, but I made a fool of myself. Everyone said that two combustion chambers were enough, there was no need to have four; and pointed out that the round shape looked better, but it was labor-intensive and material-consuming to build, and it was not cost-effective. Thinking that what the veteran master said made sense, I followed it.
    The veteran master built the furnace, and I and another comrade were engaged in design. Originally, I wanted to finish the design before starting construction, but later I wanted to save time, so I decided to design and construct at the same time. Who knew that before I could design it, the veteran master had already built the furnace.
    In fact, they built the furnace first, and I and another comrade followed behind to draw the drawings. After the furnace was built, we finished drawing the drawings. After counting, we drew a total of ten "design drawings," which became "summary drawings."
    After the furnace was built, I became worried again. Because the inner furnace wall was built with thin bricks according to the veteran master's suggestion, the thought of "unreliable" came to my mind again. I was afraid that the furnace temperature would not be raised, and I specially asked the technicians in the factory to take a look. After they said it was almost there, I felt relieved. Later, when the furnace was lit, it burned to above 1,000 degrees Celsius, completely unnecessary to worry blindly. This time, I was completely convinced of the intelligence and talent of the worker comrades. Now that I think about it, the "scientific basis" and "calculation data" I wanted ultimately came from the practice of the worker comrades. Scientific data is important, but the practice of millions of people is even more important. Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes." The practical experience in the minds of the worker comrades cannot be completely drawn by our technicians with ten or one hundred drawings.
    From then on, in the trial production of glass beads, I more consciously believed in the power of the worker comrades and more consciously relied on them. When there were problems, the first thing I thought of was not books and experts, but to put down my airs, closely rely on them, and combine with the worker comrades.
    We saw under the microscope that some glass beads had horns on their heads. If it were before, I would have buried my head in trying to figure it out myself. At this time, I thought that Master Zhang in our trial production group was an old worker, he had a lot of practice and a lot of experience, so I asked him for advice. He told me that the reason why the glass beads had horns was that some had impurities, and some had fine powder mixed in. We also discussed together measures to guard the pass, and this problem was solved smoothly.
    In order to master the law of glass bead production, I spent all my spare time for a month, consulted a large amount of data, and formulated a calculation formula based on the knowledge obtained in the experiment and the theory I had mastered. The formula required data on the distribution of the furnace tube temperature. I thought that relying on me alone would not get correct and useful data anyway. I told everyone what I had thought of during this period and explained the importance of measuring the temperature distribution. Everyone agreed and started to work together. The furnace was three meters high, but the factory could not find such a long thermocouple, and the market was out of stock. After finally finding this long thermocouple, back at the factory, the furnace was almost touching the bamboo shed roof, how to insert the thermocouple? The veteran masters proposed to make a hole in the roof and insert it from the hole. At this time, it was already the cold winter months, and the cold wind was blowing. Two worker comrades climbed onto the roof, and two other worker comrades took off their shirts, put on asbestos gloves, and stood on the scorching furnace top, sending the thermocouple into the furnace little by little from the hole in the roof, measuring a temperature every forty centimeters. They fought for more than an hour, measured all the temperature data needed, drew the curve of the temperature distribution, and found the law of production. Later, relying on the worker comrades to solve the problem of observing the firing situation in the furnace, qualified glass beads were finally made, meeting the needs of the trial units.

          Workers Are the Highest-Level Teachers
    In the two years since I entered the factory, especially after participating in the trial production of micro glass beads, I, a young man who had just walked out of school, received a very profound education. The worker comrades gave me lessons, and practice gave me lessons. These lessons are what I could not get in more than ten years of classroom education.
    Looking back on the past two years, the first lesson the veteran master gave me was how to treat ordinary labor. At that time, the veteran master often asked me to send samples to measure moisture content. At first, I felt fresh. Later, sending it every day and every month, I became bored and thought to myself: "What's the point of measuring this moisture content every day? It can't increase knowledge or learn skills!" One day, the veteran master asked me to send it again, and I couldn't help but ask: "Master, why is it necessary to control the moisture content so strictly, isn't it troublesome?" The veteran master said to me: "Don't underestimate these few numbers. If the moisture content is high, it will cause difficulties in glass melting and affect quality; if it is low, silicon dust will fly, and breathing it in can easily cause silicosis." When I heard it, the veteran master's reasoning was very profound, not just technical reasoning, but also political reasoning. The same ordinary labor, ordinary data, the old worker looked at this problem from the perspective of national interests and the interests of the working class, and saw the extraordinary in the ordinary. And me? I looked at this problem from the perspective of personal interests and personal gains and losses, and regarded the extraordinary thing as an ordinary trivial matter that was not worth doing seriously. I remember when I was studying at school, I was not happy to remember the data of quartz water content. Once, I only got four points in the exam. At that time, I was annoyed that the score was not good, and I never thought like the worker to give ordinary labor and ordinary data a revolutionary significance.
    The second lesson the worker comrades gave me was: who is clever? Is it the workers who participate in practice, or the people who only have book knowledge? Before entering the factory, I always thought I was cleverer than the workers. Later, several things happened, which had a strong impact on my self-proclaimed knowledge. For example, I have read mineral petrology. This book is specially about the role of stones. However, when I was matching ingredients in the material room, I couldn't recognize the stone powder without a sign. Later, when I could distinguish several kinds of stone powder, I thought it was almost enough. Who knew that the color of some stone powder would change? Once the color changed, I couldn't recognize it again. Once, I was sieving quartz powder. A comrade from a brother factory in another place came to visit and asked casually: how much moisture does this contain? I was stunned and couldn't answer at once. Fortunately, the veteran master was next to me. He grabbed a handful of quartz powder and squeezed it, and casually answered it. Later, I went to see the result of the small sample test, and the moisture content said by the veteran master was very close to the measured data.
    After hitting this nail, I slowly understood a truth: true knowledge comes from practice, and the people in practice are the most knowledgeable. The practice of struggle is the highest level of school, and the workers are the highest-level teachers. Chairman Mao said: "There are many intellectuals who think they have a lot of knowledge and put on a great show of knowledge, but they do not know that this kind of airs is not good, is harmful, and hinders their progress. They should know a truth, that is, many so-called intellectuals are actually relatively the most ignorant, and the knowledge of workers and peasants is sometimes more than them." This truth feels particularly kind to me now.
    Later, I took the third lesson, which made me understand how to cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people and be united with the worker comrades. The worker comrades have many excellent qualities, and these excellent qualities are impossible for those intellectuals I have contacted in the past. The worker comrades' hatred for the old society and the enemy is so deep, and their love for the Party and Chairman Mao is so great. They give off light as much as they have heat, and they never care about personal gains and losses. What they do every day is ordinary labor, but they are so loving, so focused, many comrades come to work an hour and a half early at 5:30 in the morning. When sweeping the floor, the veteran master cherishes the products he has sweated over. If there is a small piece of glass on the ground, they always habitually pick it up and put it in the basket, but I often throw it away. Many words and deeds that are unfavorable to socialism, I don't feel anything when I hear them, I laugh it off, but they remember them word by word in their hearts and launch a sharp struggle. I used to think that they spoke roughly, but now I think they speak straightforwardly, sincerely, and have a frank mind. They don't hide a sentence when they speak, unlike some intellectuals. In this way, my ideological feelings began to change. The concepts of "advanced" and "low-level" in my mind began to shake. I felt that the workers were the best teachers for me to learn from. I had to combine with the workers and honestly learn from the worker comrades.

            To Take the Revolutionary Road
    I was born in an intellectual family. The relatives and friends who often came to my home were all experts and professors. For more than twenty years, I have been living in such an environment. In my ideological feelings, I always felt that those experts and professors were the most capable, the most promising, and the most famous people. I admired and listened to their every move and every word. Therefore, I wanted to study hard since I was a child, and when I grew up, I would be like them, a "more advanced" intellectual.
    When I entered university, the Party educated us that intellectuals should be tempered and transformed through labor, study for the revolution, serve the proletariat, and be successors of the proletariat. I thought these were all right. However, I understood what revolution is and what the road that proletarian successors should take relatively abstractly. I thought that I had studied for more than ten years, and my grades have always been good. My culture is always higher than theirs. It is not easy to train a college student. How many people can there be among ten thousand? To be an ordinary worker, everyone can be, it's very convenient. I am active in participating in labor training, but it is difficult for me to accept being an ordinary worker for a lifetime from the bottom of my heart. In 1963, when I was about to graduate from university, I thought that if I chose myself, I would always choose something "more advanced". So when filling out the volunteer form, the first thing I filled in was to stay in the university to teach; the second was to go to a research institute or design institute, and the third was to go to a factory.
    After being assigned to the factory, I felt a little regret in my heart. In the past two years, I have gradually realized that the "expert" road that I yearned for in the past is a dangerous road, it will make people deviate from practical struggle, deviate from the worker-peasant-soldier masses, and finally fall into the bourgeois quagmire. I understood: what direction should a revolutionary youth move in. A youth can only go to labor, go to the worker and peasant masses, unite with them, cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people, and obtain the qualifications of ordinary workers, to become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the process of combining with the worker masses, I increasingly felt that the worker masses were my respectable and lovely teachers, they not only had knowledge that was not available in books at all, but also had noble proletarian qualities; they were the true authorities, they could not only tell a lot of first-hand practical knowledge, but also do it by themselves. I began to feel that to be a revolutionary intellectual, one must put down one's stinky airs, respectfully be a primary school student of the masses, put one's heart on the heart of the masses, and be united with them.
    To be a primary school student of worker comrades for a lifetime, this is my ambition. I want to listen to Chairman Mao's words, temper myself into a red and expert proletarian successor, and fight for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution for a lifetime.

### 群众才是真正的权威

    群众才是真正的权威
　　五好职工、“三八”红旗手、上海玻璃厂技术员　苏德宜
    三大革命运动中谁是真正的权威？我在参加试制新型产品——微型玻璃珠的过程中，亲身体会到群众才是真正的权威。
    大破依赖资产阶级“权威”的习惯势力
    微型玻璃珠是一种体积极小的圆珠，直径只有头发丝那样粗细，用放大三百倍的显微镜来看，只有黄豆那样大。这种玻璃珠是一种新型玻璃产品，目前只有少数国家能够制造。这种玻璃珠用处大得很，纺织、化工、医药、机电、染料等工业都需要它。我们在党的领导下，在八一电影制片厂、上海轻工业学校、上海轻工业研究所等二十多个单位的协作下，只花了十个月的时间，就把这项新产品的试制任务完成了。
    微型玻璃珠的诞生，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是大破对所谓“权威”“专家”的迷信，虚心向工人同志请教，和他们紧密结合所取得的胜利。
    过去，那些所谓“权威”“专家”在我的脑子里有个形象：能看很多“本本”，经常在学术刊物上发表论文。至于他们发表的这些论文和他们的活动对三大革命运动起了什么作用，我就不大去想了。反正以为这些“专家”“权威”最有本领、最了不起。
    一九六四年，我刚从学校毕业到工厂不久，领导上要我参加微型玻璃珠的试制工作。我虽然在大学里学了一些有关玻璃制造的知识，但是，这种微型玻璃珠的制造，我在学校里却没有学过。这种玻璃珠，又要小，而且还要透明，不能含一点点气泡和杂质，放在酸里碱里，还要求不变质。究竟怎样制造，没有资料，连样品也找不到。因此，我接受了这个任务后，很激动，很高兴，也觉得很困难。因此我很自然地想到，最好有这么一个微型玻璃珠的所谓“专家”让我去请教，有这么一个所谓“权威”让我去依赖，这样我们就可以快一点试制出来。后来，“权威”没有找到，我就有些畏难，不敢挑起这副重担。
    领导上看出了我的心事，鼓励我说，玻璃珠虽小，政治意义很大。做不做玻璃珠不仅是科学试验问题，也是一场反帝反修的革命斗争。特别是有两件事，我们听了肚皮也要气炸了。一九六○年我国玻璃专家到一个修正主义集团统治的国家去，听说他们有个厂生产玻璃珠，我们想参观一下，他们不让看。我们还听说，上海有家工厂，从帝国主义国家进口了一台机器，但只给了小小的两瓶玻璃珠。玻璃珠用完了，就要花大量美金再买一台机器，才能再得到两瓶玻璃珠。外国资本家就是这样卡住我们的脖子，欺负我们。我听了以后，和大家一样很气愤。我想：这些家伙太欺人了！我们中国人民是有志气的，我们一定要从自己手里做出来，争这一口气。
    哪晓得，当我下定决心的时候，有一个老工人早就闻风而动，已经利用现有的简单设备烧制出了一小瓶玻璃珠。这些玻璃珠虽然用显微镜看起来一点不圆，有的象冬瓜，有的象茄子，但是这件事对我触动很大。这位老工人为什么没有想到要靠什么“专家”“权威”？他为什么敢闯？我带着这个问题，反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章。毛主席的教导提高了我的认识。老工人一心为革命，他能急党之所急，他没有任何个人考虑，没有框框束缚，敢于实践，敢于挑重担。
          工人群众是真正的权威
    试制微型玻璃珠重要的关键之一，是建造一座炉子。我照搬书本上讲的采用电加热的炉子，我以为这样温度高，容易控制，又干净。可是，先后一连建了两座，都是几天就烧坏了，而且，效果不好。试验了几十次，都失败了。我们就开会分析，工人同志说，玻璃珠要做得圆，一定要用煤气炉子。
    要设计煤气炉，虽然我在大学里专门读玻璃瓷这门课，但就是拿不出办法来，怎么办？开始，我想从读过的书里找炉子的结构图样，翻来翻去根本没有我们需要的那种炉子。
    我向毛主席著作请教，再学了一遍《实践论》。毛主席说：“……真正亲知的是天下实践着的人”。读了这句话，我想我自己没有造过炉子，但有许多老师傅几十年来天天造炉子，天天烧炉子，他们对炉子一定是最有本领的，应该放下架子，老老实实地向他们请教。事实正是这样。我和车间工程师一起去向老师傅请教。他们听我们讲了造炉子的要求之后，想了一想就当场用砖头搭了一个模型给我们看，我从书本上找不到的煤气炉，他们却一搭就搭出来了。这给我触动很大：我读书读了不少，翻书也翻了不少，没有能拿出办法来，而他们只听我讲了个要求就“搭”出来了，真有办法。我想以后确实要放下架子，依靠群众。
    但是，就在这个过程中，是相信所谓“权威”还是相信工人同志，两种思想还在我的头脑里不断地斗争。老师傅把模型“搭”了以后，对我说：“这个作作参考，你再看看书上怎么讲的。”老师傅们态度很谦虚。我却想：地上“搭”的东西，未必“科学”，未必“可靠”。因此，我就关在房间里进行加工、设计。老师傅提出燃烧室只要两个，我怕炉温达不到，就加它一倍，设计成四个燃烧室。老师傅提出做个方形炉子，我想，搞个方筒子多难看，所以就画个圆的。草图画好了，我拿给老师傅一看，哪晓得出了“洋相”。大家都说，两个燃烧室够了，搞四个没有必要；又指出，外形圆的，看是好看点，但是砌起来又费工又伤料，不合算。想想老师傅讲的也有道理，就照着做了。
    老师傅搭炉子，我与另一个同志搞设计。本来我想先搞好设计再动工，后来想赶时间，就决定边设计、边施工。哪晓得我还没有设计出来，老师傅却把炉子造起来了。
    实际上是他们先造炉子，我和另一个同志跟在后面画图纸。等炉子造好，我们才把图纸画好，一数，一共画了十张“设计图纸”，变成了“总结图纸”。
    炉子造好后，我又担起心思来了。因为内炉壁是照老师傅的建议用薄片砖造的，脑子里“靠不住”的思想又来了。我怕炉温烧不上去，还专门请了厂内的技术员来看，等他们说差不多，我才放心了。后来炉子一点火，烧到了摄氏一千度以上，完全用不到瞎担心。这一下子，我对工人同志的聪明才智才佩服得服服贴贴。现在想起来，我所要的“科学根据”，“计算数据”，归根到底还是从工人同志实践中来的。科学的数据是重要的，但是，更重要的还是千百万群众的实践。毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄”，工人同志头脑里的实践经验，不是我们技术人员十张图纸、百张图纸所能画得完的。
    从这以后，我在玻璃珠的试制工作中，就更加自觉地相信工人同志的力量，更加自觉地依靠他们。有了问题，首先想到的就不是书本和专家，而是放下架子，紧密地依靠他们，与工人同志相结合了。
    我们在显微镜底下看到有的玻璃珠头上长了角，如果在以前，我又会闷了头一个人去摸索。这时我想，我们试制小组的张师傅是老工人，他实践得多，经验也多，我就向他请教。他告诉我，玻璃珠头上出角的原因，有的是由于有了杂质，有的是由于混进了细粉。我们还一起商量了把住关口的措施，这个问题就顺顺当当地解决了。
    为了掌握玻璃珠生产的规律，我根据试验中得到的知识和已经掌握的理论，花了一个月的所有业余时间，翻阅了大量资料，制订了一个计算公式。公式里要用炉管温度的分布状态的数据。我想，只靠我一个人是无论如何也得不到正确有用的数据的。我就把我这一时期来所想到的主意告诉大家，并且说明了测定温度分布状态的重要性。大家听了都很赞成，一起动手去干。炉子有三米高，全厂却找不到这样长的热电偶，市场上又缺货。好容易找到了这种长长的热电偶，回到厂里，炉子差不多碰到竹棚顶了，怎么把热电偶插进去呢？老师傅们提出来从棚顶上打个洞，从洞里往下插。这时候，已经是寒冬腊月了，寒风呼呼吹。有两个工人同志，爬上了棚顶，另外两个工人同志脱剩单衣，戴着石棉手套，站在滚烫的炉顶上，把热电偶从棚顶的洞里一点一点往炉子里送，每四十厘米测量一个温度。他们奋战了一个多小时，测到了所需要的全部温度数据，画出了温度分布状态的曲线，找到了生产的规律。以后又依靠工人同志解决了观察炉内烧制情况等问题，终于做出了合格的玻璃珠，满足了试用单位的需要。
          工人是最高级的老师
    我进厂两年多来，特别是参加了微型玻璃珠的试制工作，使我这个刚刚走出校门的青年，受到了一次十分深刻的教育。工人同志给我上了课，实践给我上了课。这些课，是我在十几年课堂教育中所没有办法得到的。
    回想起两年多来，老师傅给我上的第一课，是应该怎样对待平凡的劳动。那时，老师傅常常叫我送样品去测水分。开头倒还觉得新鲜。后来天天送、月月送，我就厌烦了，心里想：“这种水分天天测有啥意思？又不能长知识，又不能学本领！”有一天，老师傅又叫我送，我忍不住问：“师傅，为什么要把水分控制得这样严，不嫌麻烦吗？”老师傅对我说：“不要看不起这几个数目字。如果含水分高了，就会造成玻璃熔化困难，影响质量；低了又会硅尘飞扬，呼吸进去容易使人生硅肺病。”我一听，师傅讲的道理很深，不只是技术道理，更是政治道理。同样一桩平凡的劳动、平凡的数据，老工人从国家利益、工人阶级利益出发来看这个问题，从平凡中看到了不平凡。而我呢？从个人的兴趣、个人的得失来看这个问题，把不平凡的事，看作为不值得认认真真去做的平凡的琐事。记得在学校读书的时候，象石英含水量这个数据，我就不高兴记。有次考试只考了个四分，当时懊恼的是分数没有考好，从来没有象工人这样，给平凡的劳动、平凡的数据，赋上革命的重大意义。
    工人同志给我上的第二课是：究竟是谁高明？是亲身参加实践的劳动者，还是只有书本知识的人？进厂之前，我总觉得自己比工人高明。以后发生了几件事，对我自以为有知识的思想进行了有力的冲击。比如，我读过矿物岩石学。这本书专门是讲石头的作用的。可是，我在料房间配料时，石头粉不挂上牌子，我就认不出来。后来我对几种石头粉能够分清了，就以为差不多了，那晓得有的石头粉颜色会变的。颜色一变，我又认不出了。有一次，我正在筛石英粉，外地兄弟厂有个同志来参观，随口问我：这里面含水分多少？我呆住了，一下子答不出来。幸好老师傅在旁边，他抓起一把石英粉一捏，随口就回答了出来，后来我去看小样测验的结果，老师傅讲的含水量和测定的数据十分接近。
    碰了这个钉子，我慢慢懂得了一个道理：真正的知识来源于实践，实践中的人才是最有学问的人。斗争实践才是最高级的学校，工人才是最高级的老师。毛主席说的：“有许多知识分子，他们自以为很有知识，大摆其知识架子，而不知道这种架子是不好的，是有害的，是阻碍他们前进的。他们应该知道一个真理，就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”这条真理，我现在读起来觉得分外亲切。
    后来，我又上了第三课，使我懂得了应该怎样培养劳动人民的思想感情，同工人同志捏在一起。工人同志身上有许多优秀品质，而这些优秀品质是我过去所接触的那些知识分子所不可能有的。工人同志对旧社会、对敌人的恨是那样的深，对党和毛主席是那样的热爱，有一分热就发一分光，从不计较个人得失。他们每天做的是平凡的劳动，但他们是那么热爱，那么专心一致，许多同志早上五点半就提早一个半小时来上班了。扫地的时候，老师傅对于自己流过汗的产品十分珍惜，地上有一小片玻璃，他们总是习惯地拾进箩筐里去，而我却往往丢掉拉倒。许多不利于社会主义的言行，我听了不觉得啥，一笑了之，他们却一字一句记在心上，尖锐地展开斗争。原来觉得他们讲话粗，现在却觉得他们讲起话来直爽、诚恳，胸襟坦率，不象有些知识分子讲一句，藏一句。这样，我的思想感情就开始起了变化。我头脑里的那些“高级”“低级”的概念，开始动摇了。我感到，工人是我学习的最好的老师，要同工人结合，老老实实地向工人同志学习。
            要走革命的道路
    我出身在知识分子的家庭。我家里经常来往的那些亲戚朋友，也都是一些专家和教授。二十多年来，我就是生活在这样的环境里。在我的思想感情上，总觉得那些专家、教授是最有本领、最有前途、最有名气的人，对于他们的一举一动，一言一语，我都很佩服，很听得进去。因此，我从小就想，要好好读书，长大了做象他们那样的人，做一个“高级一点”的知识分子。
    进了大学，党教育我们，知识分子要通过劳动来锻炼来改造，要为革命读书，要为无产阶级服务，要做无产阶级的接班人。这些，我都觉得很对。但是，对于什么是革命，什么是无产阶级接班人应走的道路，我理解得都比较抽象。我想，我读了十几年书，功课一向也还好，文化总比他们要高一些。培养一个大学生不容易，一万个人中间能有几个？要做一个普通劳动者，人人好当，便当得很。对于参加劳动锻炼，我是积极的，但是，要我一辈子做一个普通劳动者，从思想深处来讲，却很难接受。一九六三年当我快要大学毕业的时候，我就想，要我自己挑，我总归要挑“高级”点的。所以填志愿时，第一填留在大学里教书；第二到研究所或设计院去，第三才是到工厂。
    分配到工厂后，我心里总有点惋惜。两年多来，我逐渐认识到：过去我向往的那种“专家”道路是危险的道路，它会使人脱离实际斗争，脱离工农兵群众，最后掉到资产阶级泥坑里。我懂得了：一个革命青年应该向什么方向前进。一个青年，只有到劳动中去，到工农群众中去，同他们打成一片，培养起劳动人民的思想感情，取得普通劳动者的资格，才能成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我在和工人群众结合的过程中，越来越感觉到：工人群众是我可敬可爱的老师，他们不但有书本上根本没有的学问，而且更有着高贵的无产阶级的品质；他们才是真正的权威，他们不但能讲出大量第一性的实际知识，更能够动手做出来。我开始感觉到：真正要做革命的知识分子，一定要放下臭架子，恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生，把心贴在群众的心上，和他们捏在一起。
    一辈子当工人同志的小学生，这就是我的志愿。我要听毛主席的话，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的无产阶级接班人，为中国革命和世界革命奋斗一辈子。　（新华社上海十五日电）
