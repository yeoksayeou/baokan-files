Title: Our Delegation at the International Workers' Conference of Textile, Clothing and Other Industries Holds High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought: Resolutely Condemns the Soviet Leadership for Aligning with the U.S. and Opposing China, Acting as an Accomplice of U.S. Imperialism; Strongly Protests the Soviet Representatives' Manipulation of the Conference to Cooperate with U.S. Imperialism in Pushing the "Two Chinas" Plot; Asian and African Representatives Praise the Chinese Revolution Led by Chairman Mao and Pay Tribute to the Chinese Delegation

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The head of the Chinese Textile Workers' Union delegation attending the Third Representative Conference of the International Textile, Clothing, Leather, and Fur Workers told Xinhua reporters today that the leaders of the Soviet trade union delegation continued to play the double-dealing tactics of "three falses" and "three truths" at this conference. While verbally shouting "unity and unification," they actually tried their best to promote a line of "peaceful coexistence" and class capitulation that betrays the interests of the working class, and instigated activities to unite with the U.S. against China. The Chinese Textile Workers' Union delegation, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with other delegations that insisted on opposing imperialism and adhering to the class struggle line, carried out a tit-for-tat struggle against the leaders of the Soviet trade union delegation, powerfully exposing the ugly face of the Soviet leading group as an accomplice and traitor serving U.S. imperialism.
　　This conference was held in Berlin from May 19th to 23rd, with 171 delegates from 43 countries participating. V. Podzerko (Soviet Union), Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, personally came to plan and manipulate the conference, implementing the line of "peaceful coexistence" and class capitulation that the Soviet leading group forced through at the Sixth Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions.
　　The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that the Vietnam issue was a prominent issue of the struggle between the two lines at this conference. The general report of the conference, following the will of V. Podzerko and the leaders of the Soviet delegation, although saying a few nice words in support of Vietnam, did not condemn the "peace talks" plot of U.S. imperialism at all, but deliberately promoted what in Vietnam "peace is the main issue," "negotiations with the South Vietnam National Liberation Front," and so on. The "Open Letter to Workers in this Industry" forcibly passed at the conference even proposed "opposing the Vietnam War." Obviously, this was serving the "peace talks" plot of U.S. imperialism. They also called for "joint action" with them in the resolution on the Vietnam issue. These words and deeds and such a resolution were resolutely opposed by the Chinese delegation and some other delegations. Indonesian trade union representative Sakiman pointed out in his speech at the conference that promoting a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue is helping U.S. imperialism prolong its life in Vietnam. The Chinese delegation questioned at the meeting who exactly they were uniting with? Who were they opposing? And listed the facts that the Soviet leading group was doing its utmost to promote U.S. President Johnson's "peace talks" trick, touting the "Tashkent Spirit," assuring the U.S. that the western front was safe and sound, and fabricating rumors about China obstructing the transit of Soviet aid materials to Vietnam, pointing out that their so-called "aid" was with ulterior motives, in order to bring the Vietnamese people's struggle into the orbit of "Soviet-U.S. cooperation dominating the world"; their loudly clamoring for aid to Vietnam "joint action" was to unite with U.S. imperialism and all reactionary forces, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation. The Chinese delegation's speech clearly pointed out that the united front of workers and people all over the world against U.S. imperialism must not include the accomplices of U.S. imperialism.
　　The general report of the conference vigorously emphasized that the fundamental task of the trade union international was: "Trade union issues take precedence," "carry out the most extensive industrial activities," and on this basis, "carry out the most extensive unified action." The leaders of the Soviet delegation also talked a lot at the meeting about "paying more attention to the specific problems of the working people in this industry." The so-called "trade union issues" and "industrial activities" they put forward actually referred to "economic and social demands." The general report did not mention at all how to guide workers in capitalist countries to understand the road to strive for their own liberation; to the workers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, it did not point out that the struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism must be carried through to the end, but said that the central task of the struggle was "opposing monopoly capital." It is very clear that this is to regard seeking immediate economic benefits as everything, limiting the workers' struggle within the scope permitted by the rule of imperialism and monopoly capital, and wanting the working class to abandon the struggle against imperialism, against colonialism, and for complete liberation. The Chinese delegation and some other delegations sharply criticized this, pointing out that these arguments are a class capitulation line that has long been criticized and bankrupt in the history of the international workers' movement. Taking the so-called "trade union issues" as the basis for the unity and unification of various factions of trade unions, its purpose is to collude with U.S. imperialism and its agents in the international trade union movement—the leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions—to serve imperialism and monopoly capital.
　　While shouting "unity and unification" at the meeting, V. Podzerko and the leaders of the Soviet trade union delegation were plotting anti-China activities. As early as when preparing for this conference, they, through the Secretariat of the Trade Union International, in the basic documents of the conference distributed to trade unions around the world, included China's territory Taiwan and Hong Kong among the Asian countries. What is particularly serious is that when the Chinese representative pointed out this serious mistake at the Administrative Committee meeting held on the eve of the conference and demanded that the Secretariat publicly declare a correction, they made all kinds of sophistry and refused to accept this solemn demand. The Chinese delegation lodged a strong protest against this naked anti-China behavior, pointing out that the Soviet leading group had long sent representatives to sit on the same bench with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to discuss Johnson's so-called "Southeast Asia Development Plan." This time they played tricks in the basic documents of the conference, which was another exposure of their deliberate cooperation with U.S. imperialism in pushing the "Two Chinas" plot.
　　The head of the Chinese delegation said that at the meeting, the Chinese delegation, in response to the activities of V. Podzerko and the leaders of the Soviet delegation, listed a series of facts, criticized their line of "peaceful coexistence" and class capitulation, exposed the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leading group, and pointed out that the Soviet leading group has become an accomplice of U.S. imperialism that betrays the interests of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world. After the Chinese delegation spoke, the Soviet delegation, through the executive chairman of the conference, read out a so-called "protest" statement. This statement slandered the Chinese delegation as "anti-Soviet" and "undermining the atmosphere of the conference," but did not dare to face the facts we exposed. V. Podzerko also slandered the Chinese delegation's speech in his speech as "groundless" and "imaginary." They also organized some lackeys to repeat the slander in the Soviet delegation's statement about "anti-Soviet" and "insult." However, their anti-China clamor did not dare to touch any substantive issues.
　　The Chinese delegation issued a statement on the Soviet delegation's so-called "protest" statement. The statement, in response to "anti-Soviet" and "groundless," raised a series of questions, demanding that the leaders of the Soviet delegation answer. The statement said: Why has the Soviet leading group always colluded with U.S. imperialism, actively peddling Johnson's "peace talks" trick, attempting to strangle the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. struggle for national salvation? Why did they vote in favor of the United Nations sending troops to massacre the people of Congo (Kinshasa)? Why did they support the United Nations' adoption of the resolution on "ceasefire" in the Dominican Republic, forcing the Dominican patriotic forces to lay down their arms? Why did they vote in the United Nations to urge British imperialism to "pacify" the situation in Southern Rhodesia? Why are they plotting to reach a "non-proliferation" treaty that maintains the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly and binds the hands and feet of the people all over the world? Why do they disregard the fact that Japanese militarist forces are stepping up their revival with the support of U.S. imperialism, and impatiently collude with the Japanese reactionaries to pursue "Soviet-Japanese amity"? Why do they actively cooperate with U.S. imperialism's global strategy and strive to organize an encirclement of socialist China? And so on. The statement said, aren't these ironclad facts? These facts eloquently show that the Soviet leading group has thoroughly betrayed the Soviet people and the people all over the world. The Soviet leading group is the real anti-Soviet force. When the Chinese representative, who was the executive chairman of the conference, read out such a fact-based, righteous, and stern questioning and statement from the Chinese delegation at the conference, the Soviet delegation was restless and fled the venue in panic. Then they tried to deprive the Chinese representative of the right to serve as executive chairman. All of these fully reflected their fear of the truth and extreme weakness.
　　Ceylon trade union representative N. Sanmugathasan also refuted the slander that the Chinese delegation was "anti-Soviet" at the meeting. He said that it is very strange logic to say that criticizing the current policies of the Soviet Union is an insult to the October Revolution. "We are not insulting the October Revolution. What we are criticizing is the betrayal of the revolutionary principles advocated by Lenin and Stalin. It is precisely those who have deviated from the principles of the October Revolution who are insulting Lenin and the October Revolution." In concluding his speech, he pointed out in an impassioned tone, "China enjoys a lofty prestige in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where the current revolutionary storm is surging. For the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, China's revolutionary leadership is a beacon." Some Asian and African representatives also paid tribute to the Chinese representatives, praising the greatness of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. Some said that "the Chinese representative's speech was clear and powerful"; others said that the Chinese delegation's "criticism of the 'peaceful coexistence' line is correct."
　　The head of the Chinese delegation said that the various facts at the meeting show that the leaders of the Soviet delegation tried to organize an anti-China united action at the meeting, which is part of the Soviet leading group's united action with U.S. imperialism and all reactionary forces throughout the world to organize opposition to China, opposition to the people, opposition to national liberation movements, and opposition to the world people's revolutionary struggle. The Chinese delegation emphasized at the meeting that workers all over the world must distinguish between enemies and friends, thoroughly expose the accomplice face of the Soviet leading group, and draw a clear line between them, form the broadest and most genuine international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and fight to defeat U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. We firmly believe that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the struggle of workers all over the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs and for the liberation of the working class will surely advance from one victory to another.

    我代表在国际纺织等工人代表会议上高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    坚决谴责苏联领导联美反华充当美帝帮凶
    强烈抗议苏联代表操纵会议配合美帝推行“两个中国”的阴谋
    亚非国家代表赞扬毛主席领导的中国革命并向中国代表致敬
    新华社八日讯　出席国际纺织、服装、皮革、皮毛工人第三次代表会议的中国纺织工会代表团负责人，今天向新华社记者发表谈话说，苏联工会代表团领导在这次会议上，继续玩弄“三假”、“三真”的两面手法，口头上高喊“团结统一”，实际上竭力推行背叛工人阶级利益的“和平共处”、阶级投降路线，策动联美反华的活动。中国纺织工会代表团高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，和其他坚持反对帝国主义，坚持阶级斗争路线的代表团一起，同苏联工会代表团领导进行了针锋相对的斗争，有力地揭露了苏联领导集团为美帝国主义效劳的帮凶和叛徒的丑恶面目。
    这次会议是五月十九日至二十三日在柏林举行的，来自四十三个国家的一百七十一名代表参加了会议。世界工会联合会书记处书记维·波杰尔科（苏联）亲自跑来策划和操纵会议，贯彻苏联领导集团强使世界工会第六次代表大会通过的“和平共处”、阶级投降路线。
    中国代表团负责人指出，越南问题是这次会议上两条路线斗争的突出问题。会议的总报告禀承维·波杰尔科和苏联代表团领导的意志，虽然讲了几句支持越南的漂亮话，但是只字不谴责美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋，别有用心地鼓吹什么在越南“和平是主要问题”、“同越南南方民族解放阵线谈判”等等。在大会上强行通过的“致本产业工人公开信”中竟提出“反对越南战争”。显而易见，这是为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋效劳。他们还在越南问题的决议中呼吁同他们“联合行动”。这些言行和这样的决议遭到了中国代表团和其他一些代表团的坚决反对。印度尼西亚工会代表萨基曼在大会发言中指出，鼓吹和平解决越南问题，这是帮助美帝国主义延长它在越南的生命。中国代表团在会上质问究竟联合谁？反对谁？并且列举了苏联领导集团极力推销美国总统约翰逊的“和谈”骗局，吹嘘“塔什干精神”，向美国保证西线平安无事和制造关于中国阻挠苏联援越物资过境的谣言等事实，指出他们的所谓“援助”是别有用心的，是为了把越南人民的斗争纳入“苏美合作主宰世界”的轨道；他们大叫大嚷的援越“联合行动”是联合美帝国主义和一切反动势力，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的革命烈火。中国代表团的发言明确指出，全世界工人和人民反对美帝国主义的统一战线决不能包括美帝国主义的帮凶。
    会议的总报告大肆强调工会国际的根本任务是：“工会问题优先”，“最广泛地开展产业活动”，在此基础上“最广泛地开展统一行动”。苏联代表团领导在会上也大讲“更加注意本产业劳动人民的具体问题”。他们提出的所谓“工会问题”、“产业活动”实际上指的是“经济社会要求”。总报告对资本主义国家工人的斗争根本不提引导工人认识争取自身解放的道路；对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲工人根本不指出必须把反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底，而却说什么斗争的中心任务是“反对垄断资本”。十分清楚，这是把谋求眼前经济利益当作一切，把工人的斗争视线限制在帝国主义和垄断资本统治许可的范围内，要工人阶级放弃反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义和争取彻底解放的斗争。中国代表团和其他一些代表团对此尖锐地进行了批判，指出这些论调是国际工人运动史上早就受到批判和破产了的阶级投降路线。以所谓“工会问题”作为各派工会团结统一的基础，其目的是要同美帝国主义及其在国际工会运动中的代理人——国际自由工联领导集团同流合污，为帝国主义和垄断资本效劳。
    维·波杰尔科和苏联工会代表团领导在会上一面高喊“团结统一”，一面策划联美反华活动。他们早在筹备这次会议时，就通过工会国际书记处在向世界各国工会散发的会议基础文件中，把中国的领土台湾和香港列入亚洲国家之中。特别严重的是，当中国代表在会议前夕举行的行政委员会会议上指出这一严重错误，要求书记处公开声明更正时，他们百般进行诡辩，拒不接受这一严正要求。中国代表团对这种赤裸裸的反华行为提出了强烈的抗议，指出苏联领导集团早就派出代表同蒋介石匪帮坐在一条板凳上开会，讨论约翰逊的所谓“开发东南亚计划”，这次他们在会议基础文件中玩弄的花招，是蓄意配合美帝国主义推行“两个中国”阴谋的又一次暴露。
    中国代表团负责人说，中国代表团在会上针对维·波杰尔科和苏联代表团领导的活动，列举一系列事实，批判了他们的“和平共处”、阶级投降路线，揭露了苏联修正主义领导集团的叛卖行径，指出苏联领导集团已经成为背叛苏联人民和世界革命人民利益的美帝国主义的帮凶。当中国代表团发言后，苏联代表团通过大会执行主席宣读了一个所谓“抗议”声明。这个声明诬蔑中国代表团“反苏”，“破坏会议气氛”，却不敢面对我们揭露的事实。维·波杰尔科在发言中也诬蔑中国代表团的发言“毫无事实根据”，是“想象出来的”。他们还组织了一些娄罗出来重复苏联代表团声明中关于“反苏”和“侮辱”的谰言。但是，他们的反华叫嚣都不敢触及任何实质问题。
    中国代表团就苏联代表团的所谓“抗议”声明发表了声明。声明针对“反苏”、“毫无事实根据”，提出了一系列的责问，要求苏联代表团领导回答。声明说：苏联领导集团为什么一直同美帝国主义串通一气，积极兜售约翰逊的“和谈”骗局，妄图扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争？为什么投票支持联合国出兵屠杀刚果（利）人民？为什么支持联合国通过关于多米尼加“停火”的决议，迫使多米尼加爱国力量放下武装？为什么在联合国投票敦请英帝国主义去“平定”南罗得西亚局势？为什么阴谋达成维持美苏核垄断、束缚全世界人民手足的“防止核扩散”条约？为什么不顾日本军国主义势力在美帝国主义支持下加紧复活，迫不及待地同日本反动派勾结，追求“苏日亲善”？为什么积极配合美帝国主义的全球战略，力图组织对社会主义中国的包围圈？等等。声明说，这些难道不是铁证如山的事实吗？这些事实雄辩地说明了苏联领导集团已经彻头彻尾地背叛了苏联人民和全世界人民。真正反苏的是苏联领导集团。当担任大会执行主席的中国代表在大会上宣读中国代表团的这样一个充满事实根据、义正词严的责问和声明时，苏联代表团坐立不安，仓惶逃离会场。继而他们又力图剥夺中国代表担任执行主席的权利。这些都充分反映了他们害怕真理和极端虚弱。
    锡兰工会代表纳·桑穆加塔桑也在会上驳斥了所谓中国代表团“反苏”的谰言。他说，把批评苏联当前政策说成是对十月革命的侮辱，这是非常奇怪的逻辑。“我们并不是侮辱十月革命，我们批评的正是对列宁和斯大林所主张的革命原则的背叛，正是那些背离了十月革命原则的人在侮辱列宁和十月革命”。他在结束发言时以激昂的语调指出，“中国在当前革命风暴高涨的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲享有崇高的威望。对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫人民来说，中国的革命领导是一座灯塔。”一些亚洲、非洲的代表还专门向中国代表致敬，歌颂毛泽东主席领导下的中国革命的伟大。有的说“中国代表的讲话清楚有力”；有的说，中国代表团“对‘和平共处’路线的批评是正确的”。
    中国代表团负责人说，会议上的种种事实说明苏联代表团领导力图在会上组织反华联合行动，这是苏联领导集团在全世界联合美帝国主义和一切反动势力，组织反对中国、反对人民、反对民族解放运动、反对世界人民革命斗争的联合行动的一部分。中国代表团在会上强调指出，全世界工人必须分清敌友，彻底揭露苏联领导集团的帮凶面目，并同他们划清界限，结成最广泛、最真实的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线，为打败美帝国主义及其走狗而斗争。我们坚信，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，全世界工人反对美帝国主义及其走狗、争取工人阶级解放的斗争必将从一个胜利走向又一个胜利。
