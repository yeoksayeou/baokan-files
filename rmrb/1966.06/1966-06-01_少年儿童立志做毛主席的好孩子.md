    A generation of revolutionary successors with socialist consciousness, capable in both literary and military pursuits, and skilled in both study and labor, is growing up.
    Young Pioneers Aspire to Be Good Children of Chairman Mao
    The Communist Youth League organizations at all levels must better lead the Young Pioneers to diligently study Chairman Mao's works, lead the Young Pioneers to grow in the three great revolutionary movements, and temper themselves in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 31st: Under the loving care and leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, a new situation of vigorous development has emerged in China's Young Pioneers movement. A new generation is growing up healthily. The vast numbers of Young Pioneers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, are studying hard and making progress every day. The Young Pioneers organizations have developed greatly, with the number of Young Pioneers increasing from 50 million to 100 million in the past year. Many areas have already organized all the children. The Young Pioneers appear more energetic and their activities are richer. These achievements are the result of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on the Young Pioneers movement, and resolutely nurturing the entire generation of children with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Amidst the new upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works among the people of the whole country, the vast numbers of Young Pioneers have also actively launched a movement to study Chairman Mao's books and learn Chairman Mao's quotations. Although the Young Pioneers are young and have limited knowledge, they love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most. Their enthusiasm for learning is extremely high. After reading Chairman Mao's books, they understand from a young age that every word of Chairman Mao is the truth, and they must have infinite faith and infinite adoration. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they will sincerely and earnestly do it. Chairman Mao's books guide them to have lofty revolutionary ideals from a young age, to have clear-cut class viewpoints, to aspire to be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and to plant the red flag of revolution all over the world. Chairman Mao's three articles, "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," have had an extremely great impact on the Young Pioneers. They learn to serve the people from a young age, taking Lei Feng and Wang Jie as examples, "Wherever the red scarf goes, good deeds are done." They learn the spirit of the Foolish Old Man, not fearing hardship or difficulties, and aspiring to be socialist "Little Foolish Old Men." They look at things, problems, and the world according to Chairman Mao's idea of one divides into two, and learn to analyze problems and handle affairs dialectically. "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good children of Chairman Mao" has become the common aspiration and action of the children of the whole country. These facts powerfully demonstrate that adults can study Chairman Mao's works, and children can also study them; not only can they study them, but they can also use them; not only can they use them, but they can use them well. It is a remarkable and great thing to plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the younger generation from an early age, and it has a far-reaching significance. It is related to whether or not we can take over and pass on Mao Zedong Thought, and it is related to whether or not we can cultivate true successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. At present, this movement is continuing to develop extensively and deeply. All revolutionaries should support this new thing with full enthusiasm and sow the revolutionary seeds of the great Mao Zedong Thought among the Young Pioneers.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Communist Youth League organizations lead the Young Pioneers to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, following the teachings of Chairman Mao to temper and grow up in revolutionary struggle, and to receive profound and vivid revolutionary education. In the current upsurge of the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, the vast numbers of Young Pioneers, with revolutionary feelings of infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao, have actively engaged in the struggle against the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang such as Deng Tuo. Tens of thousands of Young Pioneers held criticism meetings and issued strong calls: "Although we are young, we must also participate in removing poisonous weeds." In just over half a month, the *China Youth Daily* received more than 50,400 contributions from Young Pioneers. These contributions came from all over the country, from the vast numbers of workers, peasants, and soldiers' children, from children of all nationalities, and from blind and deaf-mute students. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and the facts of the great socialist motherland's brilliant achievements in all aspects, and their own personal experiences, to denounce the reactionary words and deeds of the "Three-Family Village" black gang who opposed the Party and socialism. They said: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight him to the end." The participation of Young Pioneers in this sharp and fierce class struggle has greatly promoted the cultivation of their firm revolutionary stance loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, the improvement of their socialist consciousness, and the enhancement of their ability to resist bourgeois and modern revisionist ideology and culture.
    The Communist Youth League follows the education policy formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and in the work of the Young Pioneers, promotes the lively, active, and initiative development of children in moral, intellectual, and physical education. The Young Pioneers have focused on class education, prominently educating children with the history of class struggle and the facts of the current class struggle. They organize Young Pioneers to visit "Four Olds" (old workers, old poor peasants, old Red Army soldiers, old cadres), listen to them tell "Four Histories" (village history, family history, commune history, factory history), never forgetting the bitterness of class struggle from a young age, always remembering the hatred of blood and tears, and aspiring to inherit the glorious traditions of revolutionary predecessors. They understand the truth that "we must grasp the seal, the gun, and the pen," expressing class anger and studying diligently for the revolution. The vast numbers of Young Pioneers actively participate in productive labor and public service labor within their capabilities. Many Young Pioneers have their own small experimental fields, small nurseries, small farms, and small weather outposts. With the establishment of half-farming and half-study schools in rural areas, the Young Pioneers built teams based on production brigades, which more effectively promoted the combination of education and productive labor. Young Pioneers read and labor at the same time, combining reading with production practice, developing a love of labor and good labor habits from a young age, and learning a great deal of cultural and scientific knowledge and production technology. The cultural entertainment and sports activities of the Young Pioneers have also developed greatly. Young Pioneers universally read revolutionary books, tell revolutionary stories, and sing revolutionary songs. Young Pioneers organizations in various places have also widely educated Young Pioneers against U.S. imperialist aggression and in support of the revolutionary struggles of Vietnam and the people of all countries in the world, and have carried out military sports activities such as "Little Militiamen." The patriotism and internationalism of China's Young Pioneers have been praised by countless foreign friends. A generation of revolutionary successors with socialist consciousness, capable in both literary and military pursuits, and skilled in both study and labor, is growing up.
    The Communist Youth League organizations resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to organize all the children. The number of Young Pioneers in the country has increased to 100 million in one year. Such rapid development has never happened since the founding of the Young Pioneers. The great development of the Young Pioneers organizations has satisfied the strong desire of the vast numbers of children to "wear red scarves and be good children of Chairman Mao," greatly mobilizing their political enthusiasm and inspiring their revolutionary spirit to study hard and make progress every day. Organizing all the children and guiding them to embark on the revolutionary road from an early age is a major event related to the cultivation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and the competition with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, and has been warmly supported by the broad masses of the people, especially the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "Chairman Mao thinks deeply and sees far, and has thought of things for thousands of generations."
    At present, the situation of the Young Pioneers movement is excellent, and the work of the Young Pioneers is full of vigor. The upsurge of the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution is developing vigorously, and the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the field of education will be carried out in depth. Chairman Mao's instructions on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Party committees at all levels are very concerned about and attach importance to the work of the Young Pioneers, and the People's Liberation Army and school education departments have also given strong support and help to the activities of the Young Pioneers. The task of cultivating the next generation of revolutionaries is increasingly becoming the cause of the whole Party and the people of the whole country. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League hopes that the organizations of the League at all levels will vigorously highlight politics, hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better lead the Young Pioneers to grow in the three great revolutionary movements, and temper themselves in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution; continue to earnestly grasp the development work of the Young Pioneers organizations, and strive to organize all children in the country within two or three years; carry out team activities comprehensively and regularly, give full play to the role of the Young Pioneers as a school for children to learn communism, and push China's Young Pioneers movement to a new stage.

    一代有社会主义觉悟、能文能武、会读书会劳动的革命接班人正在成长
    少年儿童立志做毛主席的好孩子
    各级团组织要更好地带领少年儿童认真读毛主席的书，带领少年儿童在三大革命运动中成长，到社会主义文化大革命中锻炼
    新华社三十一日讯　在党和毛主席的亲切关怀和领导下，我国少年儿童运动出现了蓬勃发展的新局面。一代新人正在茁壮成长。广大少年儿童遵循着毛主席的教导，好好学习，天天向上。少年先锋队组织有了很大发展，少先队员在最近一年中已由五千万发展到一亿，不少地区已经把全体少年儿童都组织起来。少先队显得更有生气，活动更为丰富。这些成绩的取得，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真执行毛主席关于少年儿童运动的指示，坚决以毛泽东思想哺育整个少年儿童一代的结果。
    在全国人民兴起学习毛主席著作的新高潮中，广大少年儿童也积极开展了读毛主席的书，学习毛主席语录的运动。少年儿童虽然年龄小，知识少，但是他们最爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，学习热情极为高涨。他们读了毛主席的书，从小就懂得毛主席的话句句是真理，一定要无限信仰，无限崇拜，只要是毛主席说的，就真心实意照着去做。毛主席的书指引着他们从小有远大的革命理想，有爱憎分明的阶级观点，立志做无产阶级革命事业的接班人，同美帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派斗争到底，把革命红旗插遍全世界。毛主席《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇著作，在少年儿童中发生了极为巨大的影响。他们从小学习为人民服务，以雷锋、王杰为榜样，“红领巾走到哪里，好事就做到哪里”。他们学习愚公精神，不怕吃苦，不怕困难，立志做社会主义的“小愚公”。他们照着毛主席一分为二的思想来看事物、看问题、看世界，学习着辩证地分析问题，处理事情。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子”，已经成为全国少年儿童的共同愿望和行动。这些事实有力地说明，毛主席著作，大人能学，少年儿童也能学；不但能学，而且能用；不但能用，而且用得好。在少年儿童一代从小扎下毛泽东思想的根子，这是一件了不起的伟大的事情，具有极为深远的意义。它关系到能不能把毛泽东思想接过来、传下去，关系到我们能不能培养出真正的无产阶级革命事业接班人。目前这个运动正在广泛深入地继续开展着，一切革命者应当满腔热情地支持这个新生事物，在少年儿童中播下伟大的毛泽东思想的革命种子。
    在党的领导下，共青团组织带领少年儿童按照毛主席关于在革命斗争中锻炼成长的教导，跟随革命长辈，积极参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，接受了深刻而生动的革命教育。在当前社会主义文化大革命的高潮中，广大少年儿童怀着无限热爱党、热爱毛主席的革命感情，积极投入了对邓拓等“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮的斗争。成千成万个红领巾举行了批判集会，发出了“我们虽然年纪小，也要参加除毒草”的强烈呼声。半个多月来，仅《中国少年报》就收到了少年儿童的来稿五万零四百多件。这些稿件来自祖国各地，投稿的有广大的工农兵子女，有各民族的儿童，有盲童和聋哑学生。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，用伟大社会主义祖国在各方面取得辉煌成就的事实和自己的亲身体会，痛斥“三家村”黑帮反党反社会主义的反动言行。他们说：“毛主席是人民心中的红太阳，谁要反对毛主席，我们就和他斗到底。”少年儿童参加这场尖锐激烈的阶级斗争，对于培养他们具有忠于毛泽东思想的坚定革命立场，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，增强他们对资产阶级、现代修正主义思想文化的抵制能力，具有极大的成效。
    共青团遵循党和毛主席制订的教育方针，在少先队工作中，促进少年儿童在德育、智育、体育几方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展。少先队大抓了阶级教育，突出地以阶级斗争的历史和现实的阶级斗争的事实教育少年儿童。他们组织少年儿童访问“四老”（老工人、老贫农、老红军、老干部），听他们讲“四史”（村史、家史、社史、厂史），从小就不忘阶级苦，永记血泪仇，立志继承革命先辈的光荣传统。他们懂得“要掌握印把子、枪杆子，还要掌握笔杆子”的道理，发阶级之愤，为革命勤奋学习。广大少年儿童积极参加了力所能及的生产劳动和公益劳动。许多少先队有自己的小试验田、小苗圃、小饲养场和小气象哨。随着农村半农半读学校的举办，少先队以生产大队为单位建队，更为有力地促进了教育和生产劳动相结合。少年儿童一面读书，一面劳动，把读书和生产实践结合起来，从小养成热爱劳动的品德和良好的劳动习惯，学到了许多文化科学知识和生产技术。少先队的文化娱乐和体育活动也有很大开展。少年儿童普遍读革命书籍，讲革命故事，唱革命歌曲。各地少先队组织还向少年儿童广泛进行了反对美帝国主义侵略，支援越南和世界各国人民革命斗争的教育，开展了“小民兵”等军事体育活动。我国少年儿童的爱国主义和国际主义精神，受到了无数外国朋友的赞扬。一代有社会主义觉悟，能文能武，又会读书、又会劳动的革命接班人正在成长。
    共青团组织坚决贯彻执行了毛主席关于把全体少年儿童组织起来的指示。全国少先队员在一年中发展到了一亿。这样迅速的发展，是建队以来没有过的。少先队组织大发展，满足了广大少年儿童“戴上红领巾，做毛主席好孩子”的强烈愿望，大大调动了他们的政治积极性，鼓舞了他们要好好学习、天天向上的革命精神。把全体少年儿童组织起来，引导他们从小走上革命的道路，这是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事，受到广大群众、特别是工人和贫农下中农的热烈拥护。他们说：“毛主席想得深，看得远，把千年万代的事都想到了。”
    当前，少年儿童运动形势大好，少先队工作生气勃勃。社会主义文化大革命的高潮正在蓬勃开展，教育领域中的兴无灭资斗争将要深入进行。毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指示已经深入人心，各级党委非常关怀和重视少先队工作，解放军和学校教育部门也给少先队活动以有力的支持与帮助。培养革命下一代的任务日益成为全党和全国人民的事业。共青团中央希望各级团的组织，大力突出政治，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地带领少年儿童在三大革命运动中成长，到社会主义文化大革命中锻炼；继续认真抓紧少先队组织的发展工作，争取两三年内在全国范围把所有少年儿童组织起来；全面地经常地开展队的活动，充分发挥少先队作为儿童们学习共产主义学校的作用，把我国的少年儿童运动推向一个新的阶段。
