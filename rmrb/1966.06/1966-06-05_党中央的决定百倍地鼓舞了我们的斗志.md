We enthusiastically support the decision of the CPC Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Committee;
We enthusiastically support the decision of the new Beijing Municipal Committee to dispatch a work team led by Comrade Zhang Chengsui to Beijing University to lead the Socialist Cultural Revolution;
We enthusiastically support the decision of the new Beijing Municipal Committee to remove all positions held by Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun and to reorganize the Beijing University Party Committee.

When we heard this news on the radio, we were extremely excited and moved. We have so much to say to the Party and Chairman Mao! But we were so excited that we couldn't speak. We shouted in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! We deeply feel that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are infinitely glorious, infinitely great, and infinitely correct. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao can we so quickly and timely sweep away the arrogance of the ghosts and snakes. We must always follow the Communist Party, always follow Chairman Mao, always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and march forward bravely!

The decisions of the Party Central Committee and the new Beijing Municipal Committee are truly heartening! They have boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing University and crushed the arrogance of all ghosts and snakes. For many years, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk have been rampant in Beijing University, spreading poison in all directions, using every means to control, suppress, and strike the proletarian left, protecting, indulging, and shielding the bourgeois rightists, and turning Beijing University into a mess. Beijing University has become an important stronghold of the "Three Family Village" black gang, a bastion of their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing University has long been indignant and intolerable. Now, the Socialist Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee has taken the reins of Beijing University from the hands of the ghosts and snakes, liberating us from the control, suppression, and strikes of the "Three Family Village" black gang. We have stood up, held our heads high, and our revolutionary spirit and determination have been greatly boosted. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Socialist Cultural Revolution!

We have an infinite love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. We will always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, striving to be good students of Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee North China Bureau and the new Beijing Municipal Committee, under the leadership of the work team led by Comrade Zhang Chengsui, we will sweep away all ghosts and snakes, carry out the Socialist Cultural Revolution in Beijing University to the end, and achieve a complete victory! We will not disappoint the Party and the people's sincere expectations, and will bravely struggle to build a truly socialist Beijing University armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We will never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and will be revolutionary for life, forever the revolutionary successors of the proletariat!

Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism, and the most powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all ghosts and snakes. Now, Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country and the world. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless. History is created by revolutionary people, and all ghosts and snakes can never stop the wheels of history. The current black gang cannot crush us, and the future black gang will never be able to crush us. Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts. Whether it is the current black gang or the future black gang, if anyone dares to touch a single hair of our beloved Party and Mao Zedong Thought, we will dare to fight to the end! We will fight to the end, generation after generation, for thousands of generations! With the armor of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, we will definitely smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang with the iron fist of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live our beloved leader and teacher, Chairman Mao!
Long live our glorious Communist Party of China!
Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    党中央的决定百倍地鼓舞了我们的斗志
    聂元梓　杨克明　赵正义　高云鹏　李醒尘　夏剑豸　宋一秀
    我们热烈拥护中共中央关于改组北京市委的决定；
    我们热烈拥护北京新市委派以张承先同志为首的工作组到北京大学领导社会主义文化大革命的决定；
    我们热烈拥护北京新市委关于撤销陆平、彭珮云的一切职务并对北京大学党委进行改组的决定。
    从广播里听到这个消息时，我们无比兴奋、激动。我们有多少话想跟党和毛主席说啊！可是，我们激动得说不出来。我们同声热烈欢呼：毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！我们深深体会到，党中央和毛主席是无限光荣、无限伟大、无限正确的。只有在党和毛主席的领导下，我们才能这么迅速、这么及时地扫尽牛鬼蛇神的威风。我们一定要永远跟着共产党，永远跟着毛主席，永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
    党中央和北京新市委的决定，真是大快人心！它长了我们北京大学无产阶级革命派的志气，灭了一切牛鬼蛇神的威风。多年以来，陆平、彭珮云之流在北京大学横行霸道，肆意放毒，千方百计地控制、压抑、打击无产阶级左派，保护、纵容、包庇资产阶级右派，把北京大学糟踏得不成样子。北京大学竟成了“三家村”黑帮的重要据点，成了他们反党反社会主义的顽固堡垒。我们北京大学的无产阶级革命派早已义愤填膺，忍无可忍了。现在，毛主席和党中央亲自领导的这场社会主义文化大革命，从牛鬼蛇神的手里夺过了北京大学印把子，把我们从“三家村”黑帮的控制、压抑、打击下解放出来，我们翻了身，抬了头，百倍地鼓舞了我们的革命志气和决心。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是社会主义文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    我们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。我们一定要在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在中共中央华北局和北京新市委的领导下，在以张承先同志为首的工作组的领导下，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把北京大学的社会主义文化大革命进行到底，一定要取得彻底的胜利！我们一定要不辜负党和人民的殷切期望，为建设一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的真正的社会主义的北京大学而英勇奋斗！我们一定要永远不忘阶级斗争，永远不忘无产阶级专政，要革命一辈子，永远做无产阶级的革命接班人！
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义、反对一切牛鬼蛇神的最强大的思想武器。现在，毛泽东思想正被我国和全世界的亿万革命群众所掌握。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是无所畏惧的。历史是由革命人民创造的，一切牛鬼蛇神永远阻挡不住历史车轮的前进。现在的黑帮压不倒我们，将来的黑帮也休想压倒我们。毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，不管是现在的黑帮，还是将来的黑帮，谁要敢碰一碰我们敬爱的党和毛泽东思想的一根毫毛，我们就敢和他斗到底！子子孙孙、千代万代都要斗到底！我们有毛泽东思想的武装，我们和亿万工农兵群众和革命知识分子在一起，我们一定要用无产阶级专政的铁拳把反党反社会主义的黑帮打它个稀巴烂！
    我们敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席万岁！
    我们敬爱的无上光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
