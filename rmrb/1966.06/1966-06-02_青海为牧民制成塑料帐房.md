    Xining (Xinhua News Agency) – After more than a year of efforts, workers at the Qinghai Plastics Factory have recently produced a batch of plastic yurts that are very popular with herdsmen. These plastic yurts are divided into two types, ridge-style and Tibetan-style, and come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
    Before trial-producing these yurts, the factory sent people to some communes in pastoral areas to conduct investigations and research. Based on the characteristics of the Qinghai grasslands and the living habits of the herdsmen, they drew up plans based on the yurts inhabited by the herdsmen. After the initial trial production of the plastic yurts was successful, they took the plastic yurts to some communes in pastoral areas to solicit opinions and made further improvements based on the opinions of the herdsmen.
    In the past, the yurts inhabited by herdsmen on the Qinghai grasslands were mostly woven from yak hair. These yurts were draughty, leaky, and had very poor insulation. Now that there are plastic yurts, living conditions in pastoral areas can be improved, and the country can also save a large amount of industrial raw material—yak hair.

    青海为牧民制成塑料帐房
    据新华社西宁电　青海塑料制品厂职工经过一年多的努力，最近制成一批深受牧民欢迎的塑料帐房。这批塑料帐房分马脊梁式和藏式两种，共有大中小三种规格。
    在试制这批帐房之前，工厂派出人到牧区一些公社作了调查研究。他们根据青海草原的特点和牧民的生活习惯，参照牧民所住的帐房，绘成了图。当塑料帐房初步试制成功之后，他们又带着塑料帐房去牧区一些公社征求意见，根据牧民的意见，作了进一步改进。
    过去青海草原牧民所住的帐房大都是用牦牛毛织成的。这种帐房透风漏雨，保温性能很差。现在有了塑料帐房，可以改善牧区的居住条件，而且还可以给国家节省大量工业原料——牦牛毛。
