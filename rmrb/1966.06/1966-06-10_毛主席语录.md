    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it, apply it, and the purpose of mastering it lies entirely in application. If you can use the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to explain one or two practical problems, then you should be praised, even if you have achieved only a few accomplishments. The more things you explain, the more universal and profound they are, the greater your achievements will be.

    毛主席语录
    对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。如果你能应用马克思列宁主义的观点，说明一个两个实际问题，那就要受到称赞，就算有了几分成绩。被你说明的东西越多，越普遍，越深刻，你的成绩就越大。
