Editor's Note: Our era is the great era of Mao Zedong. It is the era of the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought. It is the era where Mao Zedong Thought leads us from victory to victory.

Today, the newspaper introduces Blue Guirong, a son of the Yao people and deputy squad leader of a certain team in the Railway Corps. His growth not only shows that the workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country have entered a new era of mastering Mao Zedong Thought, but also uses facts to refute the various fallacies of the bourgeois "authorities" who oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

The bourgeois "authorities" say: "To study theory, one must start with those who have a certain level of culture." Chairman Mao's books are the books that revolutionary people seek liberation and happiness with. Every word of Chairman Mao is closely related to the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's books can be studied by those with culture and by those without culture. Blue Guirong has no education, but he loves the Party and Chairman Mao without limit. He holds a deep proletarian affection for Chairman Mao's books and consults them whenever he encounters problems. Therefore, he not only can study them but also studies them very well. He studies a little, uses a little, studies repeatedly, and uses repeatedly, making himself quickly grow into a selfless, globally-minded revolutionary soldier. The idea that one must start with those who have a certain level of culture is to oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers reading Chairman Mao's books, to prevent Mao Zedong Thought from meeting the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The more the bourgeois "authorities" strive to oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Revolutionary soldiers listen most to Chairman Mao's words. Whoever opposes us studying Chairman Mao's works, we will fight to the end and struggle to the end, and in this struggle, let Mao Zedong Thought shine even more brilliantly.

The cold wind howls, and frost covers the land. At this time, Blue Guirong, the deputy squad leader of the fifth squad of the first company of a certain team in the Railway Corps and a Communist Party member, braved the cold and climbed a towering mountain. He had just returned from a visit to his family in the Yao village of Duan County, Guangxi. There were only a few days left until the Spring Festival, and he had bid farewell to his relatives, whom he had not seen for four years, and returned to the unit ahead of time to participate in the construction of a large tunnel.

The "battle" to excavate the tunnel began. The fifth squad was responsible for drilling holes with wind guns and detonating explosives. The company required each work shift to detonate two rounds of explosives and not delay the handover time.

One morning, the fifth squad detonated the first round of explosives. The second round of explosives still had one hole that had not been drilled, and the handover time had arrived. According to the company's regulations, the last undrilled hole would be drilled by the next work shift, and the performance of this round of explosives would only count half for the previous shift. After work, the soldiers chattered, "We worked hard all day for someone else. In the future, we might as well drill a few holes and detonate a few explosives, drilling as deep as we detonate."

Blue Guirong also did not know what to do. Because of this, he did not sleep that night. He was thinking about which of Chairman Mao's instructions could improve his and his comrades' understanding. He thought: As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, any problem can be solved.

Blue Guirong holds a deep class affection for Mao Zedong Thought. He knows that in 1950, it was Chairman Mao who saved him and the entire Yao people from the pit of suffering. Blue Guirong has said countless times: "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Blue Guirong!" He has also shouted countless times: "Long live Chairman Mao!" For this, he specially went to the town to buy a portrait of Chairman Mao and hung it in the center of the wall in his room, looking at the beloved leader's portrait every day. He obtained warmth and happiness from the leader's benevolent smile, and he obtained the strength to struggle.

When Blue Guirong enlisted, he not only could not read, but he also could not speak Mandarin. Under such conditions, could he study Chairman Mao's works? Blue Guirong said: "Compared to comrades with education, my conditions for studying Chairman Mao's works are not as good, but I have a deep class affection for Chairman Mao's books. Just with these two ears, I must master Mao Zedong Thought."

Blue Guirong first worked hard on his Mandarin, paying attention to observing his comrades' mouth shapes when they spoke, often practicing speaking in front of mountains and trees. When he could understand what Chairman Mao's books said with his own ears, he asked comrades like Tan Renlie, who had a higher cultural level, to be his tutors in studying Chairman Mao's works, asking them to explain relevant articles whenever he had questions.

One night, Tan Renlie woke up from his sleep and saw Blue Guirong sitting on his bed deep in thought. He quietly asked, "Why aren't you sleeping?" Blue Guirong said, "I haven't thought about Chairman Mao's relevant instructions regarding the problem everyone discussed today!" Tan Renlie advised him to rest early, saying they could discuss the problem the next day.

The next day, Blue Guirong and Tan Renlie opened Chairman Mao's works together. Tan Renlie read him the passages, "Only those who are selfless...are respectable," and "Communist Party members must understand the principle of subordinating local needs to overall needs." He understood the meaning of these two passages, and his mind became clear. He immediately convened a meeting for the entire squad to discuss the matter. He was the first to speak, saying: "We must calculate the big account, look at the overall performance. No matter which squad, we are all drilling the same tunnel, and the performance cannot be lost. If we only care about our own squad and round, drilling a few holes and detonating a few explosives, we will destroy the working conditions and affect the overall progress, losing the communist spirit." After a heated discussion, everyone realized: "We are all working for the revolution, and there is no question of whether we are losing or not." After that, they not only detonated two rounds of explosives but also drilled a few more holes to hand over to the next shift, and they pulled the wind pipes and water pipes to the working face, creating conditions for the next shift.

To carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, the fifth squad and the first squad had a competition. The first squad lost the first time. Blue Guirong felt that Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessness" and "overall needs" meant that while doing a good job in one's own unit, one should also care for and help other units do a good job. This time, he did not rejoice in his squad's victory but was worried for the first squad.

The second competition. Blue Guirong thought: Doing the revolution is everyone's business. A tunnel cannot be drilled by one squad, and world revolution cannot be achieved by one squad. He did not participate in his squad's wind gun operation but stood to the side observing where the first squad's problems were. He saw that the first squad had installed the wrong drill bit; they should have installed a small one but installed a large one instead. The wind gun was also set too high, which affected the progress. He pointed out the problems they had to the first squad and shared his experience with them without reservation, giving half of the fifth squad's small drill bits to the first squad.

The third competition was about to begin, and the fifth squad's comrades lacked confidence in surpassing the first squad. Some said, "We gave our experience and drill bits to others, how can we surpass them?" Blue Guirong said, "The competition is to promote revolutionary work. Not sharing experience with others is a lack of overall awareness, and not having the confidence to surpass others is a lack of revolutionary spirit." He also said, "Doing the revolution means finding ways to surpass others, letting others push you to run faster." Everyone understood these principles, and their morale soared. Soldier Liu Zhongde even innovated the drill bit. This time, both the first squad and the fifth squad achieved good results.

Through the three competitions, the fifth squad and the first squad's thoughts rose step by step. The comrades realized: Only by resolutely following Chairman Mao's teachings, carrying forward the spirit of selflessness, and doing a good job in unity and cooperation, can all parts of the revolution exert great power, destroy an old world, and build a new world. After that, everyone became more conscious of caring for and helping each other.

In the entire company, three wind gun squads, the first and fifth squads, flew side by side, but the ninth squad lagged behind, becoming the company's "roadblock." To help the ninth squad catch up quickly, the fifth squad drilled a few more holes to hand over to them, but the ninth squad still could not catch up. The political instructor Yu Guoqing then talked to Blue Guirong, and the party branch decided to send him to the ninth squad to help with the work. Blue Guirong brought the thought that "world revolution cannot be achieved by one squad" to the ninth squad.

Blue Guirong first encountered the tall and strong soldier Mu Wenju. Working with him, he found that his enthusiasm had not been fully unleashed. Later, through individual conversations, he learned that Mu Wenju's thoughts on for whom he was a soldier and for whom he was building the road were not clear, and his family had some temporary difficulties, so he always lacked enthusiasm when doing work. Blue Guirong finally discovered: The main reason the ninth squad could not catch up was not that their skills were poor, but that their thoughts were not revolutionary enough. He then organized the entire squad to study Chairman Mao's works with the ninth squad leader Chen Yingxin, making everyone clearly understand: We are soldiers for the world revolution, building tunnels for the world revolution. Although the wind gun is small, it is doing the great cause of world revolution. The comrades said: "We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times, doing the revolution without fearing hardship and fatigue, and being willing to work for the revolution all our lives." Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Mu Wenju's heart, and he stood tall and looked far, his spirit returned, and he worked hard, pushing the wind gun and pushing the cart, being called the "strongman" by his comrades.

Blue Guirong helped the ninth squad for more than twenty days, insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, and the ninth squad's thoughts and work appearance changed. When Blue Guirong left the ninth squad, he said to the ninth squad's comrades with deep feelings: "The wind gun's rotation is good or bad, first of all, the thoughts must be good or bad, this point must not be forgotten!"

For the world revolution, to compete with imperialism for time, Blue Guirong's body was relatively weak, but when he worked, he had more strength than others. He could carry any heavy burden for the world revolution, to compete with imperialism for time.

In April 1965, the U.S. imperialists further expanded their aggression in Vietnam. The company organized everyone to denounce the crimes of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. Blue Guirong, with deep hatred, denounced first with the help of political instructor Yu Guoqing. In those bitter and cold years, Blue Guirong's family had died, and a few acres of thin fields were mortgaged to wealthy families. His parents were tortured to death by the old society, leaving behind a one-year-old younger brother, who was taken away by a kind uncle to be raised. At the age of nine, Blue Guirong was driven into the landlord's cattle pen, bearing the heavy burden of slavery, living a life like cattle and horses. Blue Guirong spoke here with indignation: "Thinking of the suffering of the 650 million people of China in the past, thinking of the suffering of two-thirds of the people in the world now, if the U.S. imperialists are not destroyed, I will not be reconciled." He, with deep hatred, worked even more tensely.

At this time, the tunnel excavation of the first company encountered difficulties. The second section (the tunnel was divided into six sections for excavation, and the second section was in the middle) progressed slowly, affecting the follow-up of the subsequent sections. The party branch decided to organize the sharp-point wind gun team to rush the second section.

Blue Guirong was the first to sign up to participate in the rush. Before going to the second section, he first asked the wind gun team with higher education to read Chairman Mao's works to everyone. He firmly remembered the words, "Choose the heavy burden to carry, and bear hardships ahead of others." He said to his comrades: "Mao Zedong Thought is for the people, for the liberation of all mankind. We execute Chairman Mao's instructions to carry heavy burdens, and we must also stand high and look far. Now, the American bandits are killing and setting fires everywhere, and we are rushing the second section, which is competing with imperialism for time."

Blue Guirong had this characteristic: no matter what work he did, he would find a relevant viewpoint of Chairman Mao as his guide to action. His method of studying Chairman Mao's works was: study a little, use a little, study repeatedly, use repeatedly, and regard Chairman Mao's words as ten thousand words. He often said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, one must work hard on the 'use' character; whether it is true study or false study, it depends on how you use it."

That night, Blue Guirong led the wind gun team to the working face of the second section. As soon as he went up, he saw that the stone chips were piled high, and there was no way to start. Blue Guirong said: "I'll go first!" He squeezed his small body into the pile of chips, lying on the stone chips, using his feet to step on the wind gun handle, launching a fierce attack on the stubborn stones.

Time passed minute by minute, the wind drill bit by bit drilled in, and Blue Guirong's sweat poured out in waves. At this time, the most active was still his heart, which was fully dedicated to serving the people. He gritted his teeth and encouraged himself: Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! The hole was drilled, and Blue Guirong was like someone who had swum out of a big river, soaked all over.

The explosion sounded, and Blue Guirong led everyone to clear the chips. They saw that the place where the explosion occurred was like a tiger's mouth, with the sharp rocks standing upright in the pile of chips, and the loosened rocks sticking out from above, with a small gap in the middle. Clearing the chips was also difficult. Blue Guirong felt that for the world revolution, to exert great effort and sweat greatly, was what a true Communist Party member should do. The domestic and international class struggle situation was so tense, and we could not work slowly. Clearing the chips could not delay time. He, disregarding fatigue, went into the tiger's mouth again, using his hands to painstakingly pull out the chips one by one.

After a hard struggle, the narrow working face of the second section became a bit wider, and one could bend over to go inside, but there were still many difficulties. Blue Guirong led everyone to use the rest time to study Chairman Mao's teachings on carrying heavy burdens again, and then said to everyone: "To carry heavy burdens is to dare to fight continuously, no matter how big the difficulties are, we cannot give up." The soldiers said: "The squad leader is a good example of acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions to carry heavy burdens. We must learn this tenacious spirit, be good vanguards, fight the first battle, and let the following troops catch up!" Everyone knelt on the chips to drill with the wind gun, and their knees were skinned, but no one complained.

No matter how heavy the burden on his shoulders, Blue Guirong had only one mind: to do more, faster, and better revolutionary work. The company required the fifth squad to advance three meters a day, and they achieved three meters and four after efforts. After work, Blue Guirong organized his comrades to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Everyone said: "Today's work was tense and good, embodying the spirit of serving the people." Blue Guirong, however, criticized himself for not doing enough and his actions not being fast enough. His self-criticism prompted everyone to use higher standards to demand of themselves and treat work.

People called Blue Guirong a "daring general" and the fifth squad a "little tiger" squad. They were carrying the heavy burden of revolution, charging forward on the revolutionary road without changing shoulders or resting. They not only broke through the second section's bottleneck, removing obstacles for the entire company, but also innovated technology, doubling the number of rounds of explosives detonated, creating the highest record in the company. In their eyes: Achieving communism in the world is an unprecedented undertaking, a very heavy burden. As long as everyone consciously carries the heavy burden of the revolutionary cause, no matter how far the road is, no matter how dangerous the road ahead is, the future of the world will definitely be ours.

Blue Guirong stood at the entrance of the tunnel, facing the world, connecting his work with the world revolution, with communism, dedicating himself to the cause of liberating all mankind. His mind had few "I"s, and he dug the tunnel without fearing any hardships or dangers, nor did he consider his personal safety.

Once, Blue Guirong and the new soldier Ou Zhongquan were drilling with wind guns on the frame. Just as they had set up the wind gun, they suddenly felt the stone chips under their feet moving. Blue Guirong immediately realized that the funnel below had collapsed, and the people would be buried under the pile of chips that was higher than a person. Their lives were seriously threatened.

In the sound of the chips pouring down, Blue Guirong heard a "ah!" Ou Zhongquan had already been rolled into half his body, and he saw him flailing his hands helplessly in the chips, and the other hand was still reaching out to grab the wind gun support frame that had fallen into the pile of chips. The chips were still pouring down fiercely, and at this time, Blue Guirong was two meters away from the funnel mouth. He only needed to quickly step a few steps to the side to immediately get out of danger. However, for Blue Guirong, who was armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this was absolutely impossible! He not only did not step a few steps to the side but also stepped closer to the funnel mouth with the rapidly rolling chips. He crouched down and reached out his hand, shouting loudly: "Quickly drop the support frame and grab my hand!" Because he was still a little far away, their hands did not reach. Ou Zhongquan was rolled deeper, and Blue Guirong was also about to be rolled down. Time did not stop, and both of them were about to be buried at the bottom of the chips. Blue Guirong's face did not change color, and his heart did not beat. Before his life ended, he felt that his responsibility was to rescue his comrade. At this critical moment, he grabbed a nearby fixed hose and first threw it to little Ou: "Quickly grab it!" Then, he used this hose to stabilize his body and grabbed little Ou's hand. In this way, little Ou was able to hang on the funnel mouth with the help of the hose and the squad leader's hand, and his body did not continue to sink. The chips, which were pouring down more and more, flowed from Blue Guirong's body, from little Ou's body, and in a while, they filled the lower guide pit. At this time, little Ou's suspended feet finally touched the ground.

Little Ou came up and held the squad leader's hand for a long time without speaking. The squad leader's spirit of fearlessness and selflessness in danger was like a strong current surging into his chest, and he was so excited that he could not speak, shaking the squad leader's hand repeatedly. Blue Guirong's emotions were also very excited. He felt that this new soldier, who had just enlisted for a few days, had extraordinary thoughts and actions. He asked: "You were almost rolled down, why did you go to grab the wind gun support frame?"

"We need it to complete the task, what if it breaks?" This was such a good comrade! At the moment of life and death, he thought not of himself but of the weapon in his hand and the state's property, which was the spirit of selflessness that Chairman Mao talked about. Blue Guirong felt that this new soldier was a good example for him to learn from.

Afterward, the comrades discussed with Blue Guirong how revolutionary soldiers should treat life and death. Blue Guirong said: "Death is nothing to be afraid of. We resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, with one heart to make the world revolution, and even if we die, we have contributed to the cause of human liberation." This is the philosophy of life of a revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Last August, there was another dangerous situation. Commander Tian Demin returned from a meeting at the regiment to check the quality of the project and immediately went into the tunnel. That day, the working face had just collapsed, and the wires had not been pulled up to the frame. The cave was pitch black, and the commander went up. Blue Guirong heard this, and while being moved by the commander's selfless work spirit, he also worried about the commander. The commander had been away from the regiment for several days, and he was not familiar with the changes in the stone quality in the tunnel. What if something happened? He then went up to the frame with the statistician Fang Baoliang.

Blue Guirong climbed onto the frame and stood on the chips. His straw hat was close to the top stone, and he had just walked a few steps, shining his flashlight to remind the commander to be careful, when he suddenly felt an unusual weight on his head. A moving large stone was right above his head, and he realized that it was about to collapse. The large stone continued to exert pressure on his head. At this time, he was only concerned about: What if the stone falls and hits the comrades? So, he shouted urgently: "It's about to collapse now, you all quickly get out of here." Blue Guirong used all his strength to straighten his waist and braced himself against the stone that was about to fall, buying time for the commander and little Fang to leave. He stared fiercely with his two eyes, seeing the commander and little Fang leave the danger zone, and he then made up his mind: Even if he lost his legs, he would keep his head to work for the revolution. He suddenly moved his head to the side from under the stone, and then quickly moved his body, but he did not escape. A millstone-sized stone fell from his side. The edge of the stone scraped his cotton clothes and hit his foot. Blue Guirong only felt his whole body go numb.

The commander ran over and shone his flashlight, seeing that his foot was bleeding badly. The commander called Fang Baoliang to quickly carry him out. Blue Guirong did not agree, feeling that the more difficult and dangerous it was, the more he had to think of everyone. He shone his flashlight to find the floating stones, calling for others to smash them to prevent the following comrades from encountering danger. The commander said: "Quickly go back, we are here." Without saying a word, he had people carry him out of the cave.

Because his right foot had two broken bones, the injury was relatively serious. The leadership wanted him to go to the hospital. He was so unwilling to leave his post. He said sadly: "A person's life is limited, and one should strive to serve the people more. Staying in the hospital, one cannot work and will only increase the people's burden, truly shameful!"

After staying in the hospital for more than a month, he heard that the unit was organizing a new "battle." He felt that participating in the new "battle" could exert great effort, sweat greatly, serve the people to the greatest extent, and contribute to the cause of human liberation to the greatest extent. He asked someone to read the news about the world revolutionary people's anti-American struggle in the newspaper and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to him. The more he listened, the more restless he became, and the more he longed to return. However, his right foot after the injury was still not very obedient. Walking, his right foot had to draw a semicircle from back to front. Blue Guirong considered: Participating in the construction like this would affect the progress. He then prepared in the ward to participate in the new "battle," practicing walking every day. The more it hurt, the more he walked, the less it obeyed, the more he walked, and finally, the semicircle became smaller. He felt that this was his first victory in participating in the new "battle."

After Blue Guirong's repeated requests, the doctor had no choice but to agree to let him leave the hospital early. He tied his right foot's cloth shoe to his foot, leaned on a stick, and hobbled back to join the "battle."

Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a long tunnel was completed nine months ahead of schedule; under the great nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the Yao soldier Blue Guirong quickly grew into a selfless, globally-minded revolutionary soldier. Now, Blue Guirong has taken on the role of squad leader. He said to his comrades: "I was saved by the Communist Party and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. I will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and pass them down as a family treasure from generation to generation, following the Communist Party forever."

    革命战士最听毛主席的话
    ——记瑶族人民的好儿子、铁道兵五好战士蓝贵荣
    马祖荫　陈达士　萧恩惠　陈济
    编者按：我们的时代是伟大的毛泽东时代，是工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想的时代，是毛泽东思想把我们从胜利引向胜利的时代。
    今天，本报介绍的瑶族人民的儿子、铁道兵某团副班长蓝贵荣同志的成长，不仅说明了我国工农兵群众已经进入掌握毛泽东思想的新时代，而且用事实驳斥了那些资产阶级“权威”反对工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想的种种谬论。
    资产阶级“权威”说：学习理论，要从“有相当文化水平的人开始”。毛主席的书是革命人民求解放、谋幸福的书。毛主席的每一句话和革命人民是息息相关的。毛主席的书有文化的人能学，没有文化的人也能学。蓝贵荣没有文化，但是他无限热爱党、无限热爱毛主席，对毛主席的书怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，碰到问题就向毛主席著作请教。因此，他不但能学，而且学得很好。他学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用，使自己迅速成长为一个大公无私、胸怀全球的革命战士。所谓要从“有相当文化水平的人开始”，就是反对工农兵读毛主席的书，就是不让毛泽东思想与工农兵见面。资产阶级“权威”老爷们越是卖劲地反对学习毛主席著作，我们就越要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。革命战士最听毛主席的话，谁要反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就和他斗到底、拚到底，并在这场斗争中让毛泽东思想发出更灿烂的光辉。
    寒风怒吼，冰霜遍野。这时，铁道兵某团一连五班副班长、共产党员蓝贵荣，冒着严寒登上了一座雄巍的高山。他是刚从广西都安瑶家山区探家归队的。离春节只有几天了，他告别了分别四年的乡亲，提前赶回部队，参加打通一座大隧道的工程。
    世界革命靠一个班闹不成功
    开挖隧道的“战斗”开始了。五班担任风枪钻眼和爆破任务。连里要求每个工班放两排炮，不能拖延交班时间。
    一天上午，五班放了第一排炮，第二排炮的炮眼还有一个没有打好，交班的时间到了。按照连的规定，最后没打好的炮眼由下一个工班补打，这排炮的成绩上一个工班只能算一半。收工后，战士们七嘴八舌地说：“辛辛苦苦地给人家干了半天。今后干脆打几个眼放几个炮，打多深放多深。”
    蓝贵荣也不知该怎么办好。为这事，晚上他没有睡着觉。他在思索着毛主席的哪些指示能提高自己和同志们的认识。他想：只要照毛主席指示办事，什么问题都能解决。
    蓝贵荣对毛泽东思想怀着深厚的阶级感情。他知道，一九五○年，是毛主席把他和整个瑶族救出了火坑。蓝贵荣不止千百次地说：“没有毛主席就没有蓝贵荣啊！”也不止千百次地喊着：
  “毛主席万岁！”为此，他专程跑到镇上买了一张毛主席象挂在房子正面墙壁的中央，天天看敬爱的领袖象。他从领袖慈祥的笑容里得到了温暖和幸福，得到了斗争的力量。
    蓝贵荣入伍时，不仅不识字，连普通话也说不来。这样的条件，能不能学习毛主席著作呢？蓝贵荣说：“和有文化的同志比，我学习毛主席著作的条件没他们好，但我对毛主席的书有深厚的阶级感情，就凭着这两只耳朵也要把毛泽东思想学到手。”
    蓝贵荣首先在普通话上下苦功夫，注意观察同志们说话时的嘴形，常常对着山川树木练习说话。当他能用自己的耳朵听懂毛主席书里说的话时，他就请覃仁烈等文化水平高的同志给自己当学习毛主席著作辅导员，有啥问题就请他们讲毛主席的有关文章。
    半夜，战士覃仁烈从睡梦中醒来，看见蓝贵荣坐在床铺上沉思。他悄声问：“咋还不睡？”蓝贵荣说：“白天大家议论的问题，我还没想到毛主席的有关指示啊！”覃仁烈劝他早点休息，有问题等到明天再说。
    第二天，蓝贵荣和覃仁烈一起翻开毛主席著作，覃仁烈给他读了“大公无私……才是可尊敬的”、“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理”两段话。他领会了这两段话的意思，心里豁然开朗了，立即召集全班开会讨论。他第一个发言说：“算账要算大账，看成绩要看全局，不管哪一个班，打的都是一个隧道，成绩是跑不了的。如果光顾本班本排多进几尺，打几个眼就放几个炮，就破坏了作业条件，影响了整个进度，失去了共产主义风格。”经过热烈的讨论，大家认识到：“都是为了干革命工作，根本不存在吃亏不吃亏的问题。”以后，他们放完了两排炮后，还要多打几个炮眼往下交，并且把风管、水管拉到作业面，为下一个工班创造条件。
    为了发扬革命英雄主义精神，五班和一班展开了比赛，第一次一班输了。蓝贵荣觉得毛主席“大公无私”和“全局需要”的教导，就是要在搞好本单位工作的同时，关心和帮助兄弟单位搞好工作。这次，他没有为本班的胜利高兴，反而在为一班着急。
    第二次比赛。蓝贵荣想：干革命是大家的事，隧道靠一个班打不通，世界革命靠一个班闹不成功。他没有参加本班的风枪操作，却站在一旁观察一班的毛病出在哪里。他看到一班钻花安得不对，本来应该安小号的，却安了大号的；风枪也架高了，这样就影响了进度。他就向一班指出他们存在的问题，同时把自己的经验毫无保留地向他们作了介绍，并把五班的小号钻花分给一班一半。
    第三次比赛又要开始了，五班同志对这次超过一班信心不足。有的说：“我们的经验和钻花都给了别人，咋能超过人家？！”蓝贵荣说：“比赛是为了推动革命工作。有经验不告诉别人，是缺乏全局观念，没信心超过人家，是革命干劲不足。”他还说：“干革命就要想办法超过人家，让人家在后面逼着自己跑得更快。”大家懂得了这些道理，鼓起了更大的干劲，战士刘忠德还革新了钻花。这次比赛，一班和五班都获得了好成绩。
    通过三次比赛，五班和一班的思想步步高升，同志们认识到：只有坚决按照毛主席的教导，发扬大公无私精神，搞好团结协作，让革命的所有部分都发挥出巨大的力量，才能摧毁一个旧世界，建设一个新世界。以后大家就更自觉地相互关心、相互帮助。
    全连三个风枪班，一、五班比翼双飞，就是九班掉在后面，成为全连的“拦路虎”。为了让九班迅速跟上去，五班多打几个炮眼交给他们，但九班还是上不去。指导员于国卿就找蓝贵荣谈话，党支部决定调他到九班帮助工作。蓝贵荣带着“世界革命靠一个班闹不成功”的思想到了九班。
    蓝贵荣首先接触的是那个体格魁梧的战士穆文举。和他一起劳动，发觉他的干劲没充分发挥出来。后来通过个别谈话，了解到他对为谁当兵、为谁修路的思想不明确，加上家庭有些暂时困难，因而干起工作来，总是没精打采的。蓝贵荣终于发现：九班上不去的原因，主要不是技术差，而是人的思想革命化不够。他就和九班长陈应鑫一起组织全班学习毛主席著作，使大家明确地认识到：我们是为世界革命当兵，为世界革命打隧道的，风枪虽小，干的是世界革命的大事。同志们说：“我们要时时刻刻按毛主席的指示办事，干革命就不能怕苦怕累，要为革命打一辈子风枪。”毛泽东思想照亮了穆文举的心，他站得高看得远了，劲也来了，一个人顶着打风枪，一个人顶着推斗车，被同志们称为“大力士”。
    蓝贵荣在九班帮助工作二十多天，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，九班的思想和工作面貌都变了。蓝贵荣离开九班时，情深意长地对九班同志说：“风枪转得好坏，首先是思想转得好坏，这一条千万不能忘记啊！”
    为世界人民挑重担，同帝国主义抢时间
    蓝贵荣身体比较瘦弱，但干起活来比别人力气大。他为了世界革命，为了同帝国主义抢时间，再重的担子也能挑起来。
    一九六五年四月，美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争，连里组织大家控诉美蒋罪行。蓝贵荣苦大仇深，在指导员于国卿帮助下，他第一个进行了控诉。在那凄风苦雨的年代，蓝贵荣家里死了人，把几亩薄田当给有钱人家，父母被旧社会活活折磨死了，留下一个一岁多的小弟弟，好心的堂伯背去喂养。九岁的蓝贵荣被赶进了地主的牛圈，压上了奴役的重担，过着牛马般的生活。蓝贵荣讲到这里愤慨地说：“一想到中国六亿五千万人民过去受的苦，一想到现在世界上三分之二的人受的苦，不消灭美帝国主义我决不甘心。”他带着深深的仇恨更加紧张地施工。
    正在这时，一连的隧道掘进遇到了困难，二部（隧道分六部开挖，二部是中间的一部）进度缓慢，影响了后面各部的跟进。党支部决定组织尖刀风枪组突击二部。
    蓝贵荣第一个报名参加突击。未上二部前，他先叫文化高的风枪手给大家读毛主席著作。他牢牢记住“担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头”这两句话，对同志们说：“毛泽东思想，就是为了人民，为了解放全人类。我们执行毛主席挑重担子的指示，也要站得高，看得远。现在美国强盗正在到处杀人放火，我们打二部，就是同帝国主义抢时间。”
    蓝贵荣就是这样一个特点，不论干什么工作，都要找毛主席的一个有关观点作为自己的行动指南。他学习毛主席著作的方法是：学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用，把毛主席的话一句当一万句。他常说：“学毛主席著作，要在‘用’字上下苦功夫；是真学，是假学，就看你用得怎样。”
    当天晚上，蓝贵荣带领风枪组来到二部的工作面。一上去，只见石碴堆得满满的，没法下手。蓝贵荣说：“我先上！”他把自己瘦小的身体从碴子堆里塞了进去，躺在石碴上，用脚踩着风枪把手，向顽石展开了猛攻。
    时间一分一分地过去，风钻一节一节地向里钻进，蓝贵荣身上的汗水一阵一阵地往外涌。这时，运动最激烈的还是他那颗全心全意为人民服务的心。他咬牙鼓励自己：挺住！挺住！挺住！炮眼打下来，蓝贵荣好象从大江大海里游泳起来的一样，浑身水淋淋的。
    炮响了，蓝贵荣领导大家来排碴，只见放炮的地方象一个老虎嘴，炸掉的岩石尖棱棱地竖立在石碴堆上，炸松的岩石尖棱棱地从上面伸了下来，中间的缝隙很小。排碴也困难重重。蓝贵荣觉得为世界革命出大力，流大汗，才是一个真正的共产党员。国内外阶级斗争形势这么紧张，我们干工作就不能慢慢来，排碴也不能耽误时间。他不顾疲劳，接着又钻到老虎嘴里去，用手艰难地把石碴一块一块扒了出来。
    经过一番艰苦奋战，二部窄小的工作面变得宽了一些，可以弯腰进里面去了，但困难还是很多的。蓝贵荣领导大家利用休息时间，又反复学习毛主席关于挑重担子的教导，然后对大家说：“要挑重担子，就是要敢于连续作战，不论困难多大也不能低头。”战士们说：“班长就是一个按毛主席挑重担子指示办事的好榜样，我们一定要学习这种顽强劲，当好尖刀，打好头阵，让后面部队跟上来！”大家跪在石碴上打风枪，膝盖跪破了皮，也没人吭声。
    不管肩头上的担子多重，蓝贵荣只有一个心劲：把革命工作干多一点，干快一点，干好一点。连里要求五班日进三米，他们经过努力达到三米四。下班后，蓝贵荣组织同志们学《为人民服务》。大家都说：“今天干得紧张，干得好，体现了为人民服务思想。”蓝贵荣却检讨自己做得不够，动作不够快。他这一检讨，促使大家用更高的标准来要求自己、对待工作。
    人们称蓝贵荣是“闯将”，称五班是“小老虎”班。他们正在挑着革命的重担，在革命的大道上不换肩不歇气地向前猛闯。他们不仅突破了二部这道难关，为全连扫除了障碍，还革新了技术，把放排炮次数提高了一倍，创造了全连最高纪录。在他们看来：在全世界实现共产主义，是一个前无古人的事业，是一副极其沉重的担子，只要大家都自觉地为革命事业挑重担子，不管路途多么遥远，不管前进的道路上多么艰险，世界的未来一定是我们的。
    把自己献给整个人类解放事业
    蓝贵荣站在隧道口，面向全世界，把自己担负的工作，同世界革命联系起来，同共产主义联系起来，把自己献给整个人类解放事业。脑子里很少有“我”字，开挖隧道，既不怕任何艰苦困难，也从不考虑个人安危。
    有一次，蓝贵荣和新战士欧中全正在排架上打风枪，刚把风枪架好，猛然觉得脚下的石碴在移动。蓝贵荣立刻意识到这是下面的漏斗垮了，人将随着这堆积一人多高的石碴直泻而下，埋在石碴底下。他俩的生命受到了严重的威胁。
    在石碴哗哗啦啦的倾泻声里，蓝贵荣听见“啊呀”一声，欧中全已被石碴卷进去半个身子，只见他一只手无力地胡乱扒着石碴，一只手还伸过去抓那掉进石碴堆的风枪支架。石碴还在一个劲地往下猛流，这时蓝贵荣离漏斗口有两米远，他只要赶紧向旁边跨上几步，就可以立刻脱离危险。但是，这对于用毛泽东思想武装起来的蓝贵荣来说，却万万办不到啊！他不但没有向旁边跨上几步，反而随着急速滚动的石碴向漏斗口跨近了一步。他蹲下伸过手去，大声喊道：“快放下支架，抓我的手！”因为离得还是远了一点，两手够不着。欧中全越卷越深，蓝贵荣也快卷下去了，时间没有停顿下来，两人很快都要埋到石碴底层去了。蓝贵荣脸不变色，心不跳，在生命没有完结之前，他觉得自己的责任就是要抢救战友。在这千钧一发的时刻，他顺手拉过附近一根固定了的皮管，首先扔给小欧：“快抓住！”然后，他才利用这根皮管稳住了自己的身子，伸手抓住小欧的手。这样，小欧就借助这根皮管和班长的手，挂在漏斗口的中央，身子才没继续往下沉。越流越欢的石碴，从蓝贵荣的身下、从小欧身子的周围，哗哗地流到小欧的脚下，一会就把下导坑填满了，这时，小欧腾空的双脚才踏到了实处。
    小欧上来握着班长的手，老久老久没有说话。班长这种临危不惧、舍己救人的精神，象一股强大的暖流冲进了胸怀，他激动得说不出话来，一个劲地摇撼着班长的手。蓝贵荣的心情也很激动，他觉得这位新战友入伍不几天，思想和行为都很不平凡。他问：“你人都快被卷下去了，还去抓风枪支架干啥？”
  “我们完成任务要靠它，摔坏了怎么办？”这是多么好的同志！在生死关头，他想到的不是自己，而是手中武器、国家财产，这就是毛主席说的大公无私的精神。蓝贵荣觉得这个新战友正是自己学习的好榜样。
    事后，同志们由救欧中全这件事同蓝贵荣谈起革命战士如何对待生死问题来。蓝贵荣说：“死，没有什么了不起的。我们坚决按照毛主席指示办事，一个心眼闹世界革命，即使死了，也是为人类解放事业贡献了力量。”这是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的人生哲学。
    去年八月，又发生过一次险情。田德民连长从团里开会回来，为了检查工程质量，一下子就钻进了隧道。那天，工作面上刚塌过方，电线还没拉上排架，洞里漆黑漆黑的，连长便上去了。蓝贵荣听说，一面为连长这种忘我的工作精神所感动，一面又为连长捏了一把汗。连长离开连队好几天了，隧道里石质变化情况他摸不清，出了问题怎么办？他便和统计员房保量一起上了排架。
    蓝贵荣爬上排架站在石碴上，藤帽紧挨着顶部石头，他刚走了几步，正打起手电筒招呼连长注意些，猛然觉得头顶上异常沉重，一块活动的大石头，不偏不倚地压在头上，他意识到马上又要塌方。大石头在他的头顶上继续施加压力。这时，他担心的只是：石头塌下来砸住了同志们怎么办？于是，他声音急促地喊：“现在就要塌方，你们赶快跑开。”蓝贵荣用尽全身力气挺起了腰杆，死命地用头顶住快要塌下来的石头，争取时间让连长、小房离开。他虎愣愣地睁着两只眼睛，瞅见连长、小房离开了危险地区，他才打定了主意：豁出腿脚不要，留下个脑袋，还可以为革命工作。他猛地从石头底下把头向旁边一偏，接着又将身子猛一闪，但是没有躲脱，一块磨盘大的石头，从身边跌下。石头的棱角擦破了棉衣，砸到了脚上，蓝贵荣只觉得浑身一阵麻木。
    连长跑过来拿电筒一照，看见他脚上流血不止，连长叫房保量快背他出去。蓝贵荣不肯，他觉得，越困难，越危险，越要想到大家。他打着电筒寻找浮石，叫别人砸掉，以免后面的同志上来发生危险。连长说：“快回去，这里有我们。”不由分说，叫人把他背出了洞。
    因为右脚打断了两根骨头，伤势比较严重，领导上要他去住医院。他是那样不愿离开自己的战斗岗位。他难过地说：“一个人的生命是有限的，应该多争取些时间为人民服务，住在医院里，不能工作，还得增加人民的负担，真惭愧！”
    住了一个多月医院，他听说部队施工要组织新的“战役”。他觉得参加新“战役”，可以出大力、流大汗，最大限度地为人民服务，最大限度地为人类解放事业贡献力量。他请人读报纸上关于世界革命人民反美斗争的消息、读《为人民服务》给他听，越听越坐卧不安，越听越归心似箭。但是负伤后的右脚还是不大听使唤，走路，右脚要由后向前划一个半圆圈，蓝贵荣考虑到：这样参加施工，是会影响进度的。他就在病房里为参加新“战役”作开了准备，每天练习走路，越痛越要走，越不听使唤越要走，终于半圆圈越来越小了。他感到这是自己参加新“战役”的头一个胜利。
    在蓝贵荣再三央求下，医生只好同意他提前出院。他把右脚上的布鞋绑在脚上，拄着一根棍子，一拐一拐地赶回来投入了“战斗”。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，一条长隧道提前九个月打通了；在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，瑶族战士蓝贵荣迅速成长为一个大公无私、胸怀全球的革命战士。现在，蓝贵荣已担负排长职务了。他对同志们说：“我是共产党救出来的，是毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的，我要读一辈子毛主席的书，并把它当作传家宝一代一代传下去，世世代代永远跟着共产党走。”
