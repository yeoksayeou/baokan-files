    The Friendship Between the Chinese People and the People of the World Cannot Be Destroyed
    Foreign Guest Leader Bakari and Mrs. Maro, Wounded by Counter-Revolutionary Criminals, Recovered Quickly
    Bakari Rebuked the Counter-Revolutionary Elements: "You Don't Love Your Country, But I Love Your Country!"
    (Our Newspaper) News: Mr. Bakari Traoré, leader of the Malian journalists delegation, and Mrs. Maro, First Secretary of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, who were stabbed by counter-revolutionary element Yang Guoqing with a knife in the Beijing Friendship Store on the morning of April 29, have quickly recovered under the active treatment and careful care of Chinese medical personnel.
    During their hospitalization, Chinese leaders and responsible persons of relevant units visited the hospital to express their sympathy. During the treatment period, both Bakari and Mrs. Maro expressed their friendliness and satisfaction with the efforts made by China in the treatment.
    After being stabbed by the counter-revolutionary element, Bakari repeatedly stated that the injury was an "accidental incident." He said, "As Chairman Mao Zedong said, bad things can be turned into good things. After this injury, I can understand more deeply the spirit of Chinese comrades serving the people so loyally and consciously." He also said, "Regarding this matter, I will forget the past and mainly think about the future. The conspiracy of the counter-revolutionaries to undermine the friendship between Mali and China will never succeed. I will work harder in the future to develop the friendship between the two countries and the friendly cooperation between the news circles of the two countries."
    Bakari also said, "This incident proves that we still have many enemies, and we still need to fight. We will always encounter many incidents in our struggle. We must learn lessons from them and raise our vigilance."
    On the afternoon of May 13, on the eve of his return to his country after recovering from his injuries, Bakari went to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Detention Center and severely rebuked the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing in person. Bakari said: "Your crime will never affect the friendship between China and Mali. Even if I am killed, it will not affect the relationship between China and Mali. You don't love your country, but I love your country! I love the friendship between China and Mali."
    The former Malian Ambassador to China, Birama Traoré, expressed full understanding to China after the incident. He said: "The friendship between Mali and China is deep and is a brotherly fighting friendship. This incident will not affect the friendship between our two countries."
    Mrs. Maro, Counselor Liebermann of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, and First Secretary Maro expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the condolences of Chinese leaders and responsible persons of relevant units to Mrs. Maro and the efforts made by China in the treatment.
    The heinous conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing has shamefully failed. Anyone who attempts to use this unfortunate incident to undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world will certainly not succeed.

    中国人民同世界人民的友谊是破坏不了的
    被反革命罪犯砍伤的外宾巴卡里团长和马罗夫人伤势很快就痊愈了
    巴卡里斥责反革命分子说：“你不爱你的祖国，我还爱你的祖国哩！”
    本报讯　四月二十九日上午，在北京友谊商店被反革命分子杨国庆持刀砍伤的马里新闻工作者代表团团长巴卡里·特拉奥雷先生和德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆一等秘书马罗的夫人，在我国医务人员的积极治疗和精心护理下，很快就痊愈了。
    住院期间，我国领导人和有关单位负责人曾前往医院慰问。在治疗期间，巴卡里和马罗夫人都表示很友好，并且对我国在治疗方面所作的努力表示满意。
    巴卡里被反革命分子砍伤后，一再表示这次受伤是“偶然事件”。他说：“正如毛泽东主席所说的，坏事可以变成好事，这次受伤后，却使我能更深地了解到中国同志那样忠诚自觉地为人民服务的精神。”他还说：“对于这件事，我将忘掉过去，主要是想到将来。反革命企图破坏马里和中国友谊的阴谋是绝不能得逞的。我今后将更加努力为两国友谊的发展、为两国新闻界之间的友好合作而努力。”
    巴卡里并且说：“这个事件证明，我们还有许多敌人，我们还需要斗争。在我们的斗争中总会碰到许多事件，我们要从中吸取教训，提高警惕。”
    五月十三日下午，巴卡里在伤愈返国前夕，曾经到北京市公安局看守所，当面严厉地训斥了反革命罪犯杨国庆。巴卡里说：“你这种罪行，绝不会影响中国和马里之间的友谊。即使我被杀死了，也不会影响中国和马里的关系。你不爱你的祖国，我还爱你的祖国哩！我爱中国和马里之间的友谊。”
    前马里驻中国大使比拉马·特拉奥雷，在这次事件发生后，对我国表示充分的谅解。他说：“马中友谊是深厚的，是兄弟般的战斗友谊。这一件事不会影响我们两国的友谊。”
    马罗夫人、德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆参赞李伯曼和一等秘书马罗，对我国领导人和有关单位负责人对马罗夫人的慰问和我国在治疗上所作的努力，表示满意和感谢。
    反革命罪犯杨国庆的罪恶阴谋，可耻地失败了。任何人企图利用这次不幸事件，来破坏中国人民和世界人民的友谊，也肯定是不能得逞的。
