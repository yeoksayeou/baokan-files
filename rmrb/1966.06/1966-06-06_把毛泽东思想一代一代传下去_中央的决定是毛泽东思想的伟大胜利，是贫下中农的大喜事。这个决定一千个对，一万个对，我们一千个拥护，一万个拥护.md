    Pass on Mao Zedong Thought from Generation to Generation
    The Central Committee's Decision is a Great Victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a Great Happy Event for Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants. This Decision is Absolutely Right, Ten Thousand Times Right! We Endorse it a Thousand Times, Ten Thousand Times!

    We, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Fangxiang Brigade, Fangxiang Commune, Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, are thrilled and overjoyed to hear on the radio that the Party Central Committee has decided to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and that the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee has decided to remove Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun from all their posts and reorganize the Peking University Party Committee. This is the most brilliant and correct decision. This decision has completely eradicated the roots of the "Three-Family Village" counter-revolutionary clique and the poisonous roots of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great happy event for the poor and lower-middle peasants. This decision is absolutely right, ten thousand times right! It fully reflects the demands of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we endorse it a thousand times, ten thousand times!
    Our cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants have deeply realized in the course of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. With political power, we have everything. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The force at the core leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party." The struggle to seize power by reorganizing the Beijing Municipal Party Committee is a major event concerning the fate and future of our Party and country, as well as a major event concerning the world revolution. A handful of revisionist elements in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee usurped leadership power. They hung out a sheep's head but sold dog meat, engaging in counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of revolution, opposing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. If the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies of these big and small black gang elements were allowed to succeed, then, as Chairman Mao said, "It would not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, or several decades at the most, before a counter-revolutionary restoration on a national scale would inevitably occur, the Marxist-Leninist party would undoubtedly become a revisionist party or a fascist party, and the whole of China would change its color." Now that the Party Central Committee has reorganized the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, seizing back the seal of power, it has safeguarded the lifeline of the proletariat. We wholeheartedly support this wise and correct decision.
    With boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and with revolutionary passion for boundless trust and boundless reverence for Mao Zedong Thought, we are determined to resolutely fight to the end against all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. This anti-Party group of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee looks very fierce, but like all reactionaries, they are paper tigers. This decision by the Central Committee has severely struck at all the ghosts and monsters at home, and also severely struck at the three enemies of imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, greatly enhancing the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Party Central Committee's decision is completely in line with the wishes of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is also the greatest support for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Whoever opposes the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, no matter who he is, no matter how high his position, how great his reputation, or how senior his qualifications, we poor and lower-middle peasants will drag them down and completely overthrow, discredit, and crush them.
    We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, learn them every day, every year, and every generation, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The "Three-Family Village" black gang elements Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun controlled the Peking University Party Committee, attempting to lead young students onto the wrong path and cultivate bourgeois successors. This, like the imperialist dream of achieving capitalist restoration in our country in the third and fourth generations, is completely wishful thinking. We are determined to stand with the revolutionary youth of Peking University and fight to the end against all revisionist elements. We must pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, shatter all the "peaceful evolution" conspiracies of all the ghosts and monsters, and ensure that our Party and country will never change color.

    把毛泽东思想一代一代传下去
    中央的决定是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是贫下中农的大喜事。这个决定一千个对，一万个对，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护
    江苏省邗江县方巷公社方巷大队　房正山　侯玉兰　陆元伯　方华翠
    我们邗江县方巷公社方巷大队的干部和贫下中农，从广播中听到党中央决定改组北京市委和北京新市委决定撤销陆平、彭珮云的一切职务、改组北京大学党委的消息，群情振奋，欢欣鼓舞。这是一个最英明、最正确的决定。这个决定彻底挖掉了“三家村”反革命集团的根子，彻底挖掉了前北京市委反党反社会主义黑线的毒根，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是贫下中农的大喜事。这个决定是一千个对，一万个对，完全反映了我们贫下中农的要求，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护。
    我们干部和贫下中农，在活学活用毛主席著作中深刻体会到，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切。毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”改组北京市委这场夺权斗争，是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途的大事，也是关系到世界革命的大事。前北京市委一小撮修正主义分子篡夺了领导权，他们挂羊头卖狗肉，披着革命外衣干反革命的勾当，反对党中央和毛主席。如果让这些大大小小的黑帮分子的反党反社会主义的阴谋得逞，那么正如毛主席说的：“不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”现在党中央改组北京市委，夺回了印把子，保住了无产阶级的命根子。我们从心眼里拥护这个英明、正确的决定。
    我们怀着对党对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限信任和无限崇敬的革命激情，决心同一切反党反社会主义分子坚决斗争到底。前北京市委这伙反党集团看样子很凶，其实和一切反动派一样，都是纸老虎。中央这个决定狠狠打击了国内一切牛鬼蛇神，也狠狠打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派这三个敌人，大大长了中国人民和世界人民的革命志气。党中央的决定是完全合乎我们贫下中农的心意的，也是对我们贫下中农最大的支持。谁要反对党中央和毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，不管他是什么人，不管他职位多高，名气多大，资格多老，我们贫下中农都要把他们拉下来，彻底把他们斗倒、斗臭、斗垮。
    我们一定活学活用毛主席著作，做到天天学，年年学，代代学，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。“三家村”黑帮分子陆平、彭珮云把持北京大学党委，企图把青年学生拉到邪路上去，培养资产阶级接班人，这和帝国主义梦想在我国第三代第四代实现资本主义复辟一样，完全是痴心妄想。我们决心和北京大学的革命青年站在一起，同一切修正主义分子斗争到底。一定要把毛泽东思想一代一代传下去，粉碎一切牛鬼蛇神“和平演变”的阴谋，保证我们党和国家永不变色。
