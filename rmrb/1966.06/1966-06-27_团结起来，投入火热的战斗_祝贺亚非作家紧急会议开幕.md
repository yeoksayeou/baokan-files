More than one hundred writers from forty-seven countries and regions in Asia and Africa have braved the numerous obstacles set up by imperialism and Soviet revisionism and arrived in our capital to participate in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. This is an unprecedented and historically significant gathering of Asian and African writers. The revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa have high hopes for the conference. This conference will certainly make significant contributions to the common cause of Asian and African peoples uniting to resist imperialism. The Chinese people warmly welcome the writers from various countries in Asia and Africa; we also warmly congratulate the opening of the conference!

The timely convening of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers is a great victory for the Asian and African peoples in smashing the sabotage plots of imperialism and its accomplices, and a great victory for the cause of Asian and African peoples uniting to resist imperialism. This Beijing conference was officially decided upon by the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers in April this year. However, the Soviet revisionist clique has been working hard to serve U.S. imperialism, plotting to sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement and the national liberation struggles of Asian and African peoples. They held an illegal and splitist meeting in Cairo on June 19 and 20, illegally deciding to set up a pseudo "Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers" and absurdly announcing the "expulsion" of the secretary-general of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers from his post. The splitist and sabotage plots of the Soviet revisionists have met with a shameful failure. The meeting of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers held on June 23 unanimously passed a statement strongly condemning the betrayal and splitist activities of the Soviet revisionists, pointing out that the Soviet revisionists have fundamentally cut themselves off from the ranks of Asian and African writers and have forever lost all rights and positions in the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers. The successful convening of this Beijing conference is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists and splitists. It shows that the tide of the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism, especially the revolutionary storm against U.S. imperialism, is unstoppable; imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries want to sabotage the cause of Asian and African peoples uniting to resist imperialism, but they will not succeed.

Currently, the struggle between the Asian and African peoples and imperialism led by the United States is unprecedentedly fierce, and the revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples are developing deeply. In recent years, imperialism has instigated dozens of counter-revolutionary coups in the Asian and African regions, launched large and small wars of aggression and armed interventions, and carried out frenzied aggression against the Asian and African regions militarily, politically, economically, and culturally. However, the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Asian and African peoples are not declining but rising.

In Asia, the heroic Vietnamese people have demonstrated the immense power of people's war, beating the U.S. aggressors into a frenzy, exposing the U.S. imperialist paper tiger once again. The anti-American patriotic struggle of the Lao people is also continuously achieving victories. The Cambodian people have successfully repelled the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its vassals, defending national independence and state sovereignty. The Korean people have persistently fought for driving U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and reunifying the motherland. The massive popular anti-American struggles in Japan are surging higher and higher. Although the Indonesian people have suffered bloody massacres and suppression by the right-wing reactionary forces supported by U.S. imperialism, the revolutionary flames in the archipelago are indomitable.

In Africa, the flames of the anti-American patriotic armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people are still burning fiercely. The people of Zimbabwe have launched a struggle for national independence. The revolutionary armed struggles of the colonial peoples of "Portuguese" Guinea, Angola, Mozambique, and other colonies are developing victoriously. The newly independent countries in Africa are making continuous progress in their struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism and in defending national independence.

The entire Asian and African regions are in a great revolutionary situation.

This Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing is being held in such a great situation in the Asian and African regions.

In the fierce struggle between the Asian and African peoples and imperialism led by the United States, the Soviet revisionists have long since betrayed the Asian and African peoples and become the shameful accomplices of U.S. imperialism in suppressing national liberation movements. They are pursuing a counter-revolutionary policy of fake anti-imperialism but real surrender, fake support but real betrayal, fake unity but real split. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been working hard to serve Johnson's "peace talks" plot, attempting to bring the great struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people into the track of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation." It is precisely the repeated betrayals and sabotage by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique that have brought difficulties to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people. Therefore, to carry the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle through to the end, it is necessary to resolutely expose and oppose the Soviet revisionists and never engage in any "joint actions" with this bunch of accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

Currently, the 700 million Chinese people are high-spiritedly carrying out a magnificent and unprecedented socialist cultural revolution under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This cultural revolution is not only related to the destiny and future of China but also to the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world. This cultural revolution has caused panic and chaos among imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, but it has been welcomed and praised by the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world. The facts have proven that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people to achieve victory, but also a powerful ideological weapon for the peoples of the world to carry out revolutionary struggles.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns in their hands. However, having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable force for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." He also said: "To make literature and art become a good part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, to help the people unite and fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind." The experiences of the Chinese people's revolution and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries in Asia and Africa have all proven that this is an unshakable truth.

All progressive writers in Asia and Africa, unite! Establish and develop a broad and genuine international united front against imperialism led by the United States, firmly hold the pen in your hands, join the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, serve the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples, and carry the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle through to the end!

### 团结起来，投入火热的战斗——祝贺亚非作家紧急会议开幕

    团结起来，投入火热的战斗
    ——祝贺亚非作家紧急会议开幕
    来自亚洲、非洲四十七个国家和地区的一百多名作家代表，冲破了帝国主义和苏联修正主义所设置的重重障碍，来到了我国首都，参加亚非作家紧急会议。这是规模空前、具有历史意义的亚非作家的大集会。亚非两大洲的革命人民对会议寄予殷切的期望。这次会议，一定会对亚非人民团结反帝的共同事业作出重大贡献。中国人民对于亚非各国的作家代表们的到来，表示热烈的欢迎；对于会议的召开，表示热烈的祝贺！
    亚非作家紧急会议的如期召开，是亚非人民粉碎帝国主义及其帮凶的破坏阴谋的一次伟大胜利，是亚非人民团结反帝事业的一次伟大胜利。这次北京会议，是亚非作家常设局在今年四月间正式决定的。但是，苏联修正主义集团竭力为美帝国主义效劳，阴谋破坏亚非作家运动和亚非民族解放斗争。他们于六月十九日和二十日在开罗举行非法的分裂会议，非法决定设立一个伪“亚非作家常设局”，并且荒唐地宣布“开除”亚非作家常设局秘书长的职务。苏联修正主义者的这一分裂和破坏阴谋，遭到了可耻的破产。亚非作家常设局六月二十三日举行的会议，一致通过声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者的背叛和分裂活动，指出苏联修正主义者从根本上自绝于亚非作家的队伍，并且永远丧失了在亚非作家常设局中的一切权利和地位。这次北京会议的胜利召开，是对美帝国主义及其走狗的沉重打击，是对苏联修正主义者和分裂主义者的沉重打击。它说明，亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争潮流，特别是反对美帝国主义的革命风暴，是抵挡不了的；帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派想要破坏亚非人民的团结反帝事业，是不能得逞的。
    当前，亚非人民同以美国为首的帝国主义之间的搏斗空前激烈，亚非人民的革命斗争正在深入发展。几年来，帝国主义在亚非地区策动了几十次反革命政变，发动了大大小小的侵略战争和武装干涉，从军事上、政治上、经济上和文化上对亚非地区进行了疯狂的侵略。但是，亚非人民的反帝革命斗争，不是越来越低落，而是越来越高涨。
    在亚洲，英勇的越南人民发挥了人民战争的无比威力，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，使美帝国主义这只纸老虎又一次显了原形。老挝人民的反美爱国斗争，也不断取得胜利。柬埔寨人民胜利地反击了美帝国主义及其附庸的侵略，维护了民族独立和国家主权。朝鲜人民坚持不懈地进行了要求把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，重新统一祖国的斗争。日本人民大规模的群众性反美斗争，一浪高过一浪。印度尼西亚人民尽管遭到美帝国主义支持下的右派反动势力的血腥屠杀和镇压，但是千岛之国的革命火焰是扑灭不了的。
    在非洲，刚果（利）人民反美爱国武装斗争的烈火，仍然在熊熊地燃烧。津巴布韦人民掀起了争取民族独立的斗争。“葡属”几内亚、安哥拉、莫三鼻给等殖民地人民的革命武装斗争，正在胜利发展。非洲新独立国家在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护民族独立的斗争中，不断前进。
    整个亚非地区是一派大好的革命形势。
    这次北京的亚非作家紧急会议，就是在亚非地区这样的大好形势下召开的。
    在亚非人民同以美国为首的帝国主义的激烈斗争中，苏联修正主义者早已背叛了亚非人民，成了美帝国主义镇压民族解放运动的可耻的帮凶。他们推行的是一套假反帝真投降、假支持真出卖、假团结真分裂的反革命政策。在越南问题上，苏联修正主义领导集团极力为约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳，妄图把英勇的越南人民的伟大斗争，纳入“美苏合作”的轨道。也正是苏联修正主义领导集团的一次又一次的出卖和破坏，给刚果（利）人民的反帝革命斗争带来了困难。因此，要把反帝革命斗争进行到底，就必须坚决地揭露和反对苏联修正主义者，而决不能同这一伙美帝国主义的帮凶搞什么“联合行动”。
    目前，七亿中国人民正在高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进行着一场轰轰烈烈的、史无前例的社会主义文化大革命，它不仅关系到中国的命运和前途，也关系到世界革命人民的利益。这场文化大革命，已经引起了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的惊慌和混乱，但是受到了亚非和世界革命人民的欢呼和赞扬。事实雄辩地证明，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就成为威力无穷的精神原子弹。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民战无不胜的、强大的思想武器，而且也是世界人民进行革命斗争的强大的思想武器。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”又说：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”中国人民革命和亚非各国人民革命斗争的经验都证明，这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    亚非一切进步的作家们，团结起来，建立和发展广泛的、真正的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的国际统一战线，紧握手中的笔杆，投身到反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争中去，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，为亚非人民的革命事业服务，把反帝革命斗争进行到底！
