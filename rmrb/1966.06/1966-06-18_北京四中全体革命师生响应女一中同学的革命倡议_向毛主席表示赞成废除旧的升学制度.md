    All Revolutionary Teachers and Students of Beijing No. 4 High School Respond to the Revolutionary Proposal of Female Students of No. 1 High School
    Expressing Support to Chairman Mao for Abolishing the Old Enrollment System
    What we are smashing is not merely an examination system; we are smashing the cultural shackles that have bound the people for thousands of years, we are smashing the breeding ground for spiritual aristocrats and highly paid classes, we are smashing the cornerstone for the emergence of modern revisionism.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: A letter to Chairman Mao from the revolutionary students of Class 5, Senior 3, of Beijing No. 4 High School, and a proposal by all the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 4 High School to all teachers and students in the city to abolish the old enrollment system. The full text is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    After reading the letter from the female students of No. 1 High School to you, we very much agree with their views. After discussion, we have added a few more suggestions. After these suggestions were broadcast throughout the school, they received a warm response from all the revolutionary teachers and students, and it was unanimously decided to make them a proposal to all teachers and students in the city.
    We are sending you a copy, and we eagerly look forward to your instructions.
          Wishing you boundless longevity!
                Revolutionary Students of Class 5, Senior 3, Beijing No. 4 High School
                                June 11, 1966
              Dare to Teach the Sun and Moon to Change to a New Sky
    We most enthusiastically hail the proposal by the female students of No. 1 High School to abolish the college entrance examination. We fully support this great revolutionary initiative. We believe that this proposal is timely and well-put, raising the morale of revolutionary youth, deflating the arrogance of the bourgeois "authority" masters, and giving the bourgeois "academic overlords" a severe blow. With the deepening development of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, the reactionary essence of the current college entrance examination system is becoming more and more exposed. Its pernicious influence is extremely widespread and far-reaching. For many years, it has been a tool for the exploiting classes to benighten the people and cultivate successors to the ruling class. In socialist today, it has become an important means of cultivating bourgeois successors and carrying out revisionist restoration.
    It seriously violates the Party's class line. It does not put politics in command but puts scores in command; it does not cultivate proletarian successors but cultivates bourgeois successors.
    It highlights professional work and belittles politics, encourages the bourgeois "white expert" road of "individual struggle" and pursuit of personal fame and status, and seriously hinders the revolutionization of young people.
    It is a new imperial examination system, binding the minds of revolutionary youth, preventing them from developing in a lively, active, and initiative manner in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, as pointed out by Chairman Mao.
    In the today of the deeply developed Socialist Cultural Revolution, in the great Mao Zedong era, we must never tolerate this sinful system poisoning the youth of New China for another day, and we must resolutely overthrow it. We suggest:
    1. Immediately abolish the college entrance examination.
    2. High school graduates should first go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to temper themselves, be approved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the three major revolutionary movements, and obtain the "ideological graduation certificate" given by them.
    3. Absorb a large number of strong revolutionaries who have been tested in class struggle from among the workers, peasants, and soldiers into schools for advanced studies.
    4. Accelerate the implementation of the educational system of part-work and part-study, and part-farming and part-study. This is the educational direction of socialism and communism.
    5. Select students from the current graduates who have a firm stand and are active in the Cultural Revolution to go to higher education.
    Chairman Mao teaches us: There is no construction without destruction. Destruction comes first, and in the process of destruction there is construction. Destroy the old of capitalism and establish the new of socialism. What we are smashing is not merely an examination system; we are smashing the cultural shackles that have bound the people for thousands of years, we are smashing the breeding ground for spiritual aristocrats and highly paid classes, we are smashing the cornerstone for the emergence of modern revisionism. Our revolutionary action is a fatal blow to the bourgeoisie. Beset by difficulties, the bourgeoisie is bound to make a dying struggle, stubbornly resisting and fighting to the end. They scold us for "rebellion" and "overturning the heavens." Bourgeois masters, you are right, we are going to rebel against the old bourgeois system and overturn the heavens of capitalist restoration. Let them scold as they please! Truth comes out of scolding, and victory comes out of struggle. Without today's great destruction, there will be no brilliant tomorrow for the proletariat. Comrades, the revolutionary road has never been smooth sailing, and there will be countless rapids, shoals, violent winds, and lightning on the revolutionary road. Comrades! Revolutionary predecessors shed their blood for the proletarian revolutionary cause, they sacrificed themselves for the Party, and their blood changed the world. Today, can we still worry about our personal future? Is there any personal interest that we cannot abandon? Everything we have belongs to the Party and the people. Apart from the future of the Party and the future of the people, we have no other personal future. The needs of the country and the needs of the Party are our needs and our highest ideals. We will resolutely do what conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely oppose what does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Dare to slash a man from his horse, even the emperor. Comrades! We unanimously decided:
    If the college entrance examination is not thoroughly reformed, without the order of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we will resolutely not enter the examination hall. We vow to be socialist workers, peasants, and soldiers, and never to be bourgeois university students!
    Our generation is a revolutionary generation. We only have the obligation to take over and pass on the great banner of socialist revolution, and we have no other rights. We swear to the Party: We will always follow the Party, follow Chairman Mao, follow the revolutionary road of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and shoulder the great responsibilities entrusted to us by the era!
    Revolutionary comrades, arise! Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, charge into battle in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, and be proletarian revolutionary vanguards.
    Comrades, the future of China and the future of the world belong to us, belong to the forever revolutionary youth!
    Now all the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 4 High School propose to all revolutionary comrades in the city: Immediately abolish the college entrance examination system!
                                All Revolutionary Teachers and Students of Beijing No. 4 High School

    北京四中全体革命师生响应女一中同学的革命倡议
    向毛主席表示赞成废除旧的升学制度
    我们打碎的决不仅仅是一种考试制度，我们打碎的是几千年来套在人民脖子上的文化桎梏，我们打碎的是产生精神贵族和高薪阶层的温床，我们打碎的是产生现代修正主义的阶石。
    新华社十七日讯　北京市第四中学高三（五）班革命学生给毛主席的一封信，以及北京市第四中学全体革命师生为废除旧的升学制度给全市师生的倡议书。全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们看了女一中同学给您的信，我们非常赞成她们的观点。经过讨论，我们又补充了几点意见。这些意见在全校广播后，得到了全体革命师生的热烈响应，并一致决定，将它做为向全市师生的倡议。
    我们给您抄送一份，我们热切盼望您给我们指示。
          祝您万寿无疆
                北京市第四中学高三（五）班革命同学
                                一九六六年六月十一日
              敢教日月换新天
    我们最热烈地欢呼女一中建议废除高等学校入学考试的倡议书。我们完全拥护这一伟大的革命创举。我们认为这个倡议提得及时，提得好，它长了革命青年的志气，灭了资产阶级“权威”老爷们的威风，给了资产阶级“学阀”们狠狠一棒。随着社会主义文化大革命的深入发展，现行高考制度的反动本质越来越暴露无遗了。它的流毒极广，影响甚大。多少年来它一直是剥削阶级愚昧人民，培养统治阶级接班人的工具。在社会主义的今天，它又成为培养资产阶级接班人，进行修正主义复辟的重要手段。
    它，严重地违反了党的阶级路线。不是政治挂帅，而是分数挂帅，不是培养无产阶级接班人，而是培养资产阶级的接班人。
    它，突出业务、贬低政治，鼓励走“个人奋斗”、追逐个人名利地位的资产阶级的“白专”道路，严重地阻碍了青年的革命化。
    它，是新的科举制度，束缚了革命青年的思想，使他们不能按照毛主席指出的，在德、智、体诸方面生动、活泼、主动的发展。
    在社会主义文化大革命深入开展的今天，在伟大的毛泽东时代，我们决不能容忍这种罪恶制度再毒害新中国的青年一天，我们要坚决打倒它。我们建议：
    一、立即废除高等学校入学考试。
    二、高中毕业生先到工农兵中去锻炼，在三大革命运动中得到工农兵的批准，取得他们给予的“思想毕业证书”。
    三、大量从工农兵中吸收在阶级斗争中经过考验的坚强的革命者入学深造。
    四、加速实行半工半读、半农半读的教育制度，这是社会主义、共产主义的教育方向。
    五、从应届毕业生中挑选在文化大革命中立场坚定、表现积极的同学升学。
    毛主席教导我们：不破不立，破字当头，立在其中。破资本主义之旧，立社会主义之新。我们打碎的决不仅仅是一种考试制度，我们打碎的是几千年来套在人民脖子上的文化桎梏，我们打碎的是产生精神贵族和高薪阶层的温床，我们打碎的是产生现代修正主义的阶石。我们这一革命行动是给资产阶级的致命打击。困兽犹斗，资产阶级必然要作垂死的挣扎，负隅顽抗，死斗到底。他们骂我们这是“造反”，这是要“翻天”。资产阶级老爷们，你们说对了，我们就是要造资产阶级旧制度的反，就是要翻资本主义复辟之天，他们要骂就随他们骂去吧！真理是骂出来的，胜利是斗出来的。没有今天的大破，就没有无产阶级光辉灿烂的明天。同学们，革命的道路从来不是一帆风顺的，在革命的道路上将会遇到无数的急流险滩，狂飚雷电。同学们，同志们！革命的前辈为了无产阶级革命事业抛头颅，洒热血，他们为党能舍己，热血换新天。今天难道我们还能为个人的前途忧虑？难道我们还有什么个人的利益不能抛弃吗？我们的一切属于党，属于人民，除了党的前途，人民的前途，我们没有任何另外的个人前途。国家的需要，党的需要就是我们的需要，就是我们最高的理想。符合毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决去做，不符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决反对。舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。同学们，同志们！我们一致决定：
    高考不作彻底的改革，没有党中央，没有毛主席的命令，我们坚决不进考场。我们誓作社会主义的工农兵，决不当资产阶级的大学生！
    我们这一代，是革命的一代。我们只有把社会主义革命的大旗接过来、传下去的义务，决没有其他的任何权利。我们向党宣誓：我们永远跟着党走，跟着毛主席走，走与工农兵结合的革命道路，担负起时代赋予我们的伟大重任！
    革命的同志们，起来吧！高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在文化革命的斗争中冲锋陷阵，作无产阶级革命的闯将。
    同志们，中国的前途，世界的前途，属于我们，属于永远革命的青年！
    现在北京四中全体革命师生向全市革命的同志倡议：立即废除高等学校入学考试制度！
                                北京市第四中学全体革命师生
    一九六六年六月十日
