    A Few Words
    Clumsy Disguise
    The American "consulate" in Hue was burned down by angry demonstrators. However, a US State Department spokesman said that this "does not reflect the feelings of the Vietnamese people."
    Just two days ago, the American "Washington Post" reported that American officials in South Vietnam "experienced growing disappointment," mainly because the South Vietnamese people's "anti-American sentiment is rising." The US State Department is obviously aware of this. Then how can it be said that the burning of the American "consulate" "does not reflect the feelings of the Vietnamese people"? It should be said that the burning of an American "consulate" is far from fully reflecting the extremely strong anti-American sentiment of the South Vietnamese people.
    Another Catering
    The Soviet government actively responded to Johnson's suggestion to conclude a so-called "international treaty" on the peaceful use of the moon and celestial bodies with the United States. This is another action by the Soviet revisionists to cater to US imperialism.
    The Soviet leading group has been pursuing US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. Now they are even expanding this "cooperation" beyond the Earth, vainly attempting to jointly dominate the universe. Their appetite is getting bigger and bigger, and their ugly faces are becoming more and more completely exposed.

### 三言两语

    三言两语
    拙劣的掩饰
    美国在顺化的“领事馆”被愤怒的示威群众焚毁。美国国务院发言人却说什么这“并不反映越南人民感情”。
    就在前两天，美国《华盛顿邮报》才报道说，在南越的美国官员“失望情绪发展了”，主要的原因是，南越人民“反美情绪日益高涨”。这一点，美国国务院显然不是不知道的，那末怎么能说美国“领事馆”的被焚“不反映越南人民感情”呢？应该说，一个美国“领事馆”的被焚，还远未把南越人民极端强烈的反美情绪全部反映出来才对。
    又一个迎合
    苏联政府积极响应约翰逊的建议，要求同美国订立所谓和平利用月球和天体的“国际条约”。这是苏联修正主义者迎合美帝国主义的又一动作。
    苏联领导集团一直追求美苏合作主宰世界，现在竟进而要把这种“合作”扩大到地球以外，妄想共同主宰宇宙。他们的胃口真是越来越大，而他们的丑恶嘴脸也就越来越暴露得彻底。
