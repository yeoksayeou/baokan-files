    Xinhua News Agency Reporter's Commentary on the 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival
    Warmly Praise the Great Mao Zedong Thought
    Warmly Praise the New Socialist Era
    This music festival demonstrates three important characteristics: 1. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting the revolutionization of music and dance, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in the field of music and dance; 2. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the fighting posture of the main force of the Cultural Revolution, participated in a series of activities from creation and performance to commentary; 3. In addition to performances in theaters, the music festival also went deep into factories, rural areas, and military units, bringing revolutionary songs and dances to the doorstep of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and asking them to examine and approve them.

    Under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, which began on May 14th, has concluded victoriously on the 31st. This was a music festival that praised the great Mao Zedong Thought more fervently than ever before; this was a music festival that served proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers; this was a music festival in which the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers rose up to participate, to consolidate and expand the socialist music and dance front, to open fire on the demons and monsters who oppose the Party and socialism, and to challenge bourgeois "authorities" and "experts."
      This music festival lasted eighteen days, with a total of thirty-eight performances and more than two hundred revolutionary and militant song and dance programs, winning enthusiastic praise from more than 110,000 spectators, including workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and young students, and millions more viewers enjoyed these programs through radio and television.
    This music festival demonstrates three important characteristics: 1. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously promoting the revolutionization of music and dance, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in the field of music and dance; 2. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the fighting posture of the main force of the Cultural Revolution, participated in a series of activities from creation and performance to commentary; 3. In addition to performances in theaters, the music festival also went deep into factories, rural areas, and military units, bringing revolutionary songs and dances to the doorstep of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and asking them to examine and approve them.
    The great Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, and the most powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people and the people of the world to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. We must embody it in music and dance and all literature and art. This is the Party spirit principle of proletarian literature and art, the most prominent symbol that distinguishes proletarian literature and art from the literature and art of all other classes, and the most important task for revolutionary literary and artistic workers.
    At this music festival, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary music and dance workers in Shanghai concentrated on warmly praising Mao Zedong Thought with a large number of magnificent songs and dances. They held special performances in the Cultural Square, Shanghai's largest theater with more than 10,000 spectators, singing Mao Zedong's poems, which are loved and recited by people all over the country. In various special programs of the music festival, they sang and danced enthusiastically, praising Chairman Mao as the red sun in our hearts and relying on Mao Zedong Thought for revolution. Many of the performances reflected Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on never forgetting class struggle, the people being the real heroes, people's war being the most effective magic weapon for defeating imperialism and its running dogs, and self-reliance, hard work, and diligence in building the country; at the same time, they enthusiastically praised the Chinese people, especially the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who were armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for their revolutionary heroism in daring to change the world, enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements constantly made on all fronts of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and praised the boundless love and infinite respect of all ethnic groups for Chairman Mao. After listening to the recitation of Chairman Mao's poems, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers asked to set some of Chairman Mao's quotations to music so that they could be widely recited. Many people had strong reactions to the special programs "Long Live the Victory of People's War," "Ode to Heroes," "Learn from Daqing, Learn from Dazhai," and "Revolutionary Modern Opera Concert." They said that this "Shanghai Spring" truly sang the voice of our revolutionary people, raised a clear revolutionary banner in the current socialist Cultural Revolution, enhanced the ambition of the proletariat, and destroyed the prestige of the bourgeoisie, powerfully cooperating with the mass movement of the nationwide socialist Cultural Revolution and heavily hammering the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang.
    Particularly encouraging is that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from the front lines of production and combat fully demonstrated the powerful prestige of the main force of the socialist Cultural Revolution at this "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, greatly revitalizing this music festival with the brilliance of the socialist era.
    Shanghai is a city with millions of industrial workers, and Shanghai workers have a glorious revolutionary tradition. At this music festival, the broad masses of workers performed "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light," which they created with deep class feelings, reflecting their active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and "Break Through! Break Through! Break Through! Break Out Your Own Road," which reflected their self-reliance, hard work, and the pioneering of their own path in industry and science and technology under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to scale the world's peaks. Farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai performed "Three Electric Wires Go to the Countryside," reflecting the vigorous atmosphere of the new socialist countryside under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. The PLA troops stationed in Shanghai performed "Bayonet Drill," which demonstrated the heroic spirit of the people's soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. These many programs are all portrayals of the fervent revolutionary struggle life of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, reflections of their revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, and profound embodiments of their most unwavering belief in the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the mainstays of the three great revolutionary movements and the creators of brand-new socialist culture and art. The revolutionary songs and dances they created and performed at this music festival have clear banners and strong proletarian characteristics. They are the fighting weapons they use to carry out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie, to seize and expand the socialist ideological and cultural front. These songs and dances are full of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, and overflow with the simple temperament of the working people.
      What is even more gratifying is that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively participated in the commentary activities of this "Shanghai Spring." During this music festival, more than 100 workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically commented on the performances at more than a dozen symposiums. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers also published commentary articles in Shanghai newspapers, and some even wrote letters and made phone calls directly to the performing units to express their opinions. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction that the political standard is first and the artistic standard is second in literary and artistic criticism, they gave enthusiastic support to many programs and kindly pointed out the shortcomings in some works. They made very pertinent criticisms of various aspects of the works, from the political content and performing arts to the costumes, props, scenery, lighting, reporting, and curtain calls.
    It is a major event of epoch-making significance that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers create, perform, and comment on their own works and actively participate in the political struggle on the cultural front. They are worthy of being the pioneers of the socialist Cultural Revolution.
      Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are all for the masses of the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are created for and utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." This music festival followed Chairman Mao's teachings. In order to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the professional music and dance actors participating in the performance broke the routine of previous "Shanghai Spring" festivals. They first performed in music halls and theaters in the city for nine days, and then spent nine days sending the most wonderful revolutionary songs and dances praising the great Mao Zedong Thought and expressing the fervent struggle life of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly to the front lines of production and combat, such as factories, rural areas, and PLA garrisons. The actors also went to Minhang, a new industrial zone in Shanghai, and the huge Hudong Workers' Cultural Palace, as well as fields, workshops, clubs, and dining halls, to give concentrated performances for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This was a revolutionary action of this "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival.
    Transferring the stage of the music festival to the most basic masses allowed professional literary and artistic workers to more directly feel the heroic spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in building and defending the motherland, promoted their learning from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more directly heard more opinions from workers, peasants, and soldiers. When the actors of "Shanghai Spring" came to the Weihai Iron Factory, a Daqing-style enterprise famous throughout the country for making revolution under reed mat sheds, and sang the lyrics "Today's blacksmiths make machines, and attack the cutting edge under reed mat sheds," which reflected the revolutionary ambition of the factory's workers, it aroused a strong resonance among the workers. Their performances in other factories, as well as in rural areas and military units, were also warmly received everywhere. This approach of the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival proved that revolutionary songs and dances can only better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers if they are taken directly to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can only become works that are truly loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers after being identified and revised by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival also showed an extremely important truth: to vigorously create and develop socialist music and dance, we must vigorously overthrow the bourgeois "authorities" and thoroughly eliminate a series of fallacies they spread in the field of music and dance. No destruction, no construction. Only by thoroughly destroying can we truly construct. Destruction comes first, and construction is in it. This is a life-and-death political struggle between two fundamentally different paths of proletarian music and dance and bourgeois music and dance.
    The performance of songs and dances at this "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival that praised the great Mao Zedong Thought and expressed the revolutionary feelings of the proletariat, which were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, was a head-on blow to the bourgeois "authorities." The bourgeois "authorities" are most afraid of praising the great Mao Zedong Thought and praising proletarian heroes in music and dance and all literature and art. However, they dare not say it directly. They often adopt the tactic of opposing the red flag under the banner of the red flag, attempting to extract the proletarian class nature from music and dance and all literature and art, and nonsensically claiming that "workers, peasants, and soldiers have low culture and do not understand music," "music is the art of emotion, and people's joys, sorrows, and joys are common," and vigorously promoting the fallacy of so-called "musical mystery" and "music is beyond class" to deny the Party spirit principle of proletarian music and dance and cover up the bourgeois reactionary essence of some of their decadent, rotten, and empty musical works, and use this to poison the broad masses of the people. This cannot be done and cannot deceive people. Facts have proved that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who love the proletarian revolutionary songs and dances performed this time cannot listen to them and cannot write them. And the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers do not want to listen to or sing those works they created that express the bourgeois individualist leisure and other reactionary ideas. The joys and sorrows of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are fundamentally opposed to their joys and sorrows. Revolutionary music and dance workers must draw a clear line with the bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," use the viewpoint of class analysis to thoroughly expose the ugly essence of their works that are covered up under the so-called "beautiful and charming melody," and expose their dreams of spiritually corrupting the revolutionary people through bourgeois music. Revolutionary music and dance workers must stand firmly on the proletarian position, thoroughly overthrow the bourgeois "authorities" and "experts," and thoroughly smash all their fallacies in order to create great socialist new music and dance with high revolutionary passion.
    The revolutionary songs and dances performed at this music festival also broke through the frameworks set by the bourgeois "authorities" from the revolutionary content and the needs of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and made many new creations in the performing arts. The bourgeois "authorities" have always clamored for the "first theory of vocal music skills" and have always used the excuse that instrumental music has its own special properties and the content it expresses has limitations and cannot express the socialist spirit of the times and class struggle. This music festival resolutely and forcefully refuted these fallacies with facts. At the "Mass Singing Conference" with nearly 2,000 people participating, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers singers sang loudly about the great Party, the great motherland, and the great leader Chairman Mao. How magnificent their singing was! How high-spirited! How sincere and moving! They have not received any special training in vocal music skills, but they have boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, have strong revolutionary feelings, and sing wholeheartedly for the revolution, so they sing the revolutionary momentum and the most artistically infectious singing. Such singing can never be sung by those who are immersed in grasping what sound is "pure" and "beautiful."
    Reorganizing a revolutionary literary and art team that is armed with Mao Zedong Thought and will never change its color has become a very urgent political matter at present.
    People have seen from the successful performance of this "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival that encouraging changes are taking place in Shanghai's music and dance team. A revolutionary young new army of music and dance is growing rapidly. In particular, a large number of amateur music and dance workers from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers who can both work, fight, and do literature and art have appeared on the stage of music and dance art. They resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, take up literary and artistic weapons to serve the three great revolutionary movements, and fundamentally change the face of Shanghai's music and dance team. In recent years, the vast majority of professional music and dance workers have also followed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, and have gone to factories and rural areas to delve into life and participate in the socialist education movement, and have gone to the company to serve as soldiers. They have been tempered in the revolutionary furnace of the fiery struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly fighting with the "I" character, strengthening the ideological feelings of the proletariat, and making progress year by year. They have been further educated in the mass movement of the current socialist Cultural Revolution. They are high-spirited and full of vigor, and take severely hitting back at the frenzied attacks of anti-Party and anti-socialist demons and monsters as their common political goal. In the process of rehearsal and performance, they study Chairman Mao's works every day and grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works in everything. They study before the performance, study after the performance, and perform on stage with Mao Zedong Thought, and then use Mao Zedong Thought to examine themselves after the performance. The actors have the motherland in mind, keep the world in sight, vigorously promote the style of singing and dancing for the revolution, vigorously promote the style of unity and cooperation, and vigorously promote the style of learning from amateur literary and artistic soldiers of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This has greatly established a good atmosphere in Shanghai's music and dance art team of highlighting politics and highlighting Mao Zedong Thought.
    Many music and dance workers in Shanghai who participated in this music festival have a common and profound feeling from the socialist Cultural Revolution and this combat practice: To be a revolutionary soldier in the socialist literary and art team who always firmly believes in Mao Zedong Thought and is always loyal to the Party, one must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to highlight politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. While transforming the objective world and transforming the subjective world, first transform the subjective world; while transforming the world outlook and the artistic outlook, first transform the world outlook; while transforming ideological awareness and methods, first transform ideological awareness, including changing the way of life. Modify it honestly, modify it conscientiously, modify it for a long time, and there can be no falsehood or excuses. Only in this way can we have true common language and common feelings with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can we create and perform works that are loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    This "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival took Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and made some good achievements. However, compared with the requirements of the new situation of the current upsurge of the socialist Cultural Revolution, it is not adapted enough. In particular, the ideological transformation of professional music and dance workers is still some distance away from Chairman Mao's teachings and the expectations of the Party and the people, and they need to make further arduous efforts.
    The 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival has successfully concluded. Shanghai's music and dance workers will continue to take Chairman Mao's works and return to the fiery struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers to further integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They and the amateur music and dance workers of workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously stated: We must hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to actively participate in the socialist Cultural Revolution, work together to completely destroy the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. They firmly believe that as long as they listen to the words of the Party Central Committee and listen to the words of Chairman Mao, they will be able to create more and better music and dance that are worthy of our great era, and will be able to carry out this unprecedented socialist Cultural Revolution to the end and achieve complete victory!

    新华社记者评述第七届“上海之春”音乐会
    热烈歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想
    热烈歌颂社会主义新时代
    这一届音乐会显示出三个重要的特点：一、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大搞音乐舞蹈的革命化，在音乐舞蹈领域内兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想；二、广大工农兵以文化大革命主力军的战斗姿态，参加了从创作、演出到评论的一系列活动；三、音乐会除了在剧场演出外，还深入工厂、农村和部队，把革命歌舞给工农兵送上门去，请工农兵审查批准。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，从五月十四日起举行的第七届“上海之春”音乐会，已经在三十一日胜利结束。这是一次空前热烈地歌颂伟大毛泽东思想的音乐会；这是一次为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的音乐会；这是一次有广大工农兵奋起参加的，为巩固地占领和扩大社会主义音乐舞蹈阵地，向反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神开火，向资产阶级“权威”、“专家”挑战的音乐会。
      这届音乐会历时十八天，先后演出了三十八场、二百多个革命的战斗的歌舞节目，赢得了广大工农兵、革命干部、青年学生共十一万多观众的热烈赞扬，还有成百万观众通过广播和电视欣赏了这些节目。
    这一届音乐会显示出三个重要的特点：一、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大搞音乐舞蹈的革命化，在音乐舞蹈领域内兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想；二、广大工农兵以文化大革命主力军的战斗姿态，参加了从创作、演出到评论的一系列活动；三、音乐会除了在剧场演出外，还深入工厂、农村和部队，把革命歌舞给工农兵送上门去，请工农兵审查批准。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是中国人民和世界人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大的思想武器，我们必须在音乐舞蹈以及一切文学艺术中加以体现。这是无产阶级文艺的党性原则，是无产阶级文艺区别于其他一切阶级的文艺的最显著的标志，是革命文艺工作者头等重要的任务。
    上海广大工农兵和革命的音乐舞蹈工作者，在这一届音乐会上，以大量的气壮山河的歌曲和舞蹈，集中地热烈歌颂毛泽东思想。他们在观众多达一万多人的上海最大的剧场——文化广场举行专场演出，演唱了为全国人民所喜爱和传诵的毛主席诗词。他们在音乐会各个专场节目中，高歌欢舞，赞颂毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。演出的不少节目，反映了毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争，人民群众是真正的英雄，人民战争是战胜帝国主义及其走狗最有效的法宝，以及自力更生、奋发图强、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国等一系列光辉思想；同时，还热烈歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，特别是广大工农兵英雄人物敢教日月换新天的革命英雄主义气概，热烈歌颂毛泽东思想指导下的我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设各条战线上不断取得的辉煌成就，以及各族人民对毛主席的无比热爱和无限崇敬。广大工农兵聆听了毛主席诗词演唱以后，纷纷要求把毛主席的一些语录也谱成曲，使之广泛传诵。许多人对于《人民战争胜利万岁》、《英雄赞歌》、《学大庆、学大寨》、《革命现代戏曲演唱》专场等，都有强烈的反应。他们说，这一届“上海之春”真正唱出了我们革命人民的心声，在当前社会主义文化大革命中举起了鲜明的革命大旗，长了无产阶级的志气，灭了资产阶级的威风，有力地配合了全国声势浩大的社会主义文化大革命的群众运动，沉重地锤击了反党反社会主义黑帮。
    特别令人振奋的是来自生产和战斗第一线的广大工农兵在这届“上海之春”音乐会上，充分显示出社会主义文化大革命主力军的强大声威，使这届音乐会大大焕发出社会主义的时代光采。
    上海是一个拥有百万产业工人的城市，上海工人有光荣的革命斗争传统。广大工人在这届音乐会上，演出了他们以深厚的阶级感情创作的反映他们活学活用毛泽东思想的《毛主席著作闪金光》，以及反映他们在毛泽东思想指导下自力更生、奋发图强、在工业和科学技术上闯出自己的道路、攀登世界高峰的《闯！闯！闯！闯出一条自己的路》。上海郊区农民演出了在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，社会主义新农村到处一片蓬勃朝气的《三根电线通到农村来》。驻沪解放军演出了表现毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士所向无敌的英雄气概的《拚刺刀》等。这许多节目都是广大工农兵火热的革命斗争生活写照，都是他们敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神的反映，都是他们对伟大的毛泽东思想最坚定信仰的深刻体现。
    广大工农兵是三大革命运动的中流砥柱，是崭新的社会主义文化艺术的创造者。他们在这届音乐会上创作和演出的革命
  歌舞，旗帜鲜明，具有强烈的无产阶级特性，是他们用来进行兴无灭资斗争，争夺和扩大社会主义思想文化阵地的战斗武器，这些歌舞充满着革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义，洋溢着劳动人民纯朴的气质。
      更可喜的是广大工农兵积极参加了这届“上海之春”的评论活动。这届音乐会期间，一百多个工农兵群众分别在十多个座谈会上，对演出节目热情加以评论，许多工农兵还在上海各报发表评论文章，有的还写信、打电话直接向演出单位提出意见。他们按照毛主席关于文艺批评政治标准第一、艺术标准第二的指示，对许多节目给予热情支持，并且善意地指出一些作品中的缺点。他们从作品的政治内容和表演艺术，以至服装、道具、布景、灯光和报幕、谢幕等各个方面，都提出了十分中肯的批评意见。
    广大工农兵自己创作，自己演出，自己评论，积极参加文化战线上的政治斗争，这是具有划时代意义的大事。他们无愧于社会主义文化大革命的先锋。
      毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这一届音乐会遵循毛主席的教导，为了更好地为工农兵服务，参加演出的专业音乐舞蹈演员，打破了历届“上海之春”的常规，先用九天时间在市内音乐厅和剧场演出，接着又用九天时间，把赞颂伟大的毛泽东思想和表现广大工农兵火热斗争生活的最精彩的革命歌舞，直接送到工厂、农村、解放军驻地等生产和战斗第一线。演员们还到上海新兴的工业区闵行和规模巨大的沪东工人文化宫，以及田头、车间、俱乐部、饭厅，为广大工农兵作了集中的演出。这是这届“上海之春”音乐会一个革命化的行动。
    把音乐会的舞台转移到最基层的群众中去，就使专业文艺工作者更直接地感受到广大工农兵建设祖国保卫祖国的英雄气概，促进他们向广大工农兵学习，并且更直接地听到了更多工农兵的意见。当“上海之春”的演员来到以芦席棚下闹革命而闻名全国的大庆式企业卫海铁工厂，给工人演唱起“今日铁匠造机器，芦席棚下攻尖端”这两句反映这家工厂工人革命志气的歌词时，引起了工人强烈的共鸣。他们在其他工厂以及农村和部队的演出，也到处受到亲切的接待和热烈的欢迎。“上海之春”音乐会的这个做法证明：革命歌舞，只有直接拿到广大工农兵中去演出，才能更好地为工农兵服务，并且要经过工农兵鉴别、加以修改，才能成为工农兵所真正喜爱的作品。
    第七届“上海之春”音乐会还显示出一个极为重要的真理：要大力创造和发展社会主义的音乐舞蹈，就必须大张旗鼓地打倒资产阶级“权威”，彻底破除他们在音乐舞蹈领域内散布的一系列谬论。不破不立。只有彻底地破，才能真正地立。破字当头，立也就在其中了。这是无产阶级音乐舞蹈同资产阶级音乐舞蹈这两条根本不同的道路之间一场你死我活的政治斗争。
    这届“上海之春”音乐会演出了受到广大工农兵热烈欢迎的歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想和大抒无产阶级革命之情的音乐舞蹈，就是对资产阶级“权威”的当头棒喝。资产阶级“权威”最害怕在音乐舞蹈以及一切文学艺术中歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂无产阶级英雄人物。但是，他们又不敢直接说出来。他们往往采取打着“红旗”反红旗的手法，妄图从音乐舞蹈以及一切文学艺术中抽出无产阶级的阶级性，胡说什么“工农兵文化低、不懂音乐”、“音乐是感情的艺术，而人的喜怒哀乐是共同的”，大肆宣扬所谓“音乐神秘”、“音乐超阶级”的谬论，来否定无产阶级音乐舞蹈的党性原则，掩盖他们写的一些颓废、腐朽、空虚的音乐作品的资产阶级反动实质，并以此来毒害广大人民。这是办不到的，骗不了人的。事实证明，这次演出的受到广大工农兵喜爱的无产阶级革命歌舞，他们就是听不进去，更是写不出来。而他们创作的那些抒发资产阶级个人主义闲情逸致等反动思想的作品，广大工农兵就是不要听，不要唱。广大工农兵的喜怒哀乐同他们的喜怒哀乐本来就是根本对立的。革命的音乐舞蹈工作者，必须同资产阶级“权威”“专家”划清界限，用阶级分析的观点，去把他们那些掩盖在所谓“优美、迷人的旋律”之下的作品的丑恶本质彻底揭露出来，戳穿他们通过资产阶级乐曲从精神上腐蚀革命人民的梦想。革命的音乐舞蹈工作者，一定要站稳无产阶级立场，彻底打倒资产阶级“权威”“专家”，彻底粉碎他们的一切谬论，才能以高昂的革命激情，创造出伟大的社会主义的新音乐舞蹈。
    这届音乐会演出的革命歌舞，还从革命内容出发，从广大工农兵需要出发，冲破了资产阶级“权威”所设置的框框，在表演艺术上有了很多新的创造。资产阶级“权威”一向叫嚷什么声乐的“发声技巧第一”论，一向借口什么器乐有自己的特殊性能，表现的内容有局限性，它不能表现社会主义时代精神和阶级斗争。这届音乐会都用事实给这些谬论以坚决有力的回击。在有近二千人参加的“群众歌咏大会”上，广大工农兵歌手放声歌唱伟大的党，伟大的祖国，伟大的领袖毛主席，他们的歌声多么雄壮！多么昂扬！多么真挚感人！他们并未受到过什么声乐技巧的专门训练，但是他们怀着对党和毛主席的无限热爱，具有强烈的革命感情，一心一意为革命而歌唱，他们就唱出了革命气势磅礴和最有艺术感染力的歌声。这样的歌声，是那些终日醉心于捉摸什么声音的“纯”呀“美”呀的人所永远唱不出来的。
    重新组织一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的永不变色的革命的文艺队伍，已经成为当前十分迫切的政治大事。
    人们从这届“上海之春”音乐会的成功演出中看到，上海的音乐舞蹈队伍正在发生可喜的变化。一支革命的年青的音乐舞蹈新军正在迅速成长。特别是大量既会劳动、打仗，又会文艺的广大工农兵群众业余音乐舞蹈工作者登上了音乐舞蹈艺术舞台，他们坚决听毛主席的话，拿起文艺武器为三大革命运动服务，从根本上改变了上海音乐舞蹈队伍的面貌。近年来，绝大多数的专业音乐舞蹈工作者也遵循毛主席文艺方向，纷纷到工厂、农村深入生活和参加社会主义教育运动，下连队当兵，在工农兵火热斗争生活的革命熔炉中，经受锻炼，不断地同“我”字斗，增强了无产阶级的思想感情，一年比一年有进步。他们在当前的社会主义文化大革命的群众运动中又进一步受到了教育。他们斗志昂扬，意气风发，以狠狠回击反党反社会主义牛鬼蛇神的猖狂进攻作为共同政治目标，在排练和演出过程中，天天学习毛主席著作，事事抓紧学习毛主席著作。演出前学，演出后学，带着毛泽东思想上台表演，演出后又用毛泽东思想对照检查自己。演员们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，大兴为革命歌唱，为革命舞蹈之风，大兴团结协作之风，大兴向工农兵业余文艺战士学习之风。这就大大地树立了上海音乐舞蹈艺术队伍突出政治、突出毛泽东思想的好风气。
    参加这届音乐会的上海许多音乐舞蹈工作者，从社会主义文化大革命和这次战斗的实践中，都有这样一个共同的深刻感受：要在社会主义的文艺队伍中当一个永远坚信毛泽东思想，永远忠于党的革命战士，只有念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。在改造客观世界和改造主观世界的同时，首先改造主观世界；在改造世界观和艺术观的同时，首先改造世界观；在改造思想意识和思想方法的同时，首先改造思想意识，包括改变生活方式。老老实实地改，认认真真地改，长期地改，来不得半点虚假，来不得半点推脱。这样才能与广大工农兵有真正的共同语言，共同感情，才有可能创作和表演出为工农兵所喜爱的作品。
    这一届“上海之春”音乐会以毛泽东思想挂帅，作出了一些好的成绩。但是跟当前社会主义文化大革命高潮的新形势的要求相比，还不够适应。特别是专业音乐舞蹈工作者的思想改造，与毛主席的教导，与党和人民的期望，还有不少距离，有待于他们进一步作艰巨的努力。
    第七届“上海之春”音乐会胜利结束了。上海音乐舞蹈工作者将继续带着毛主席著作，回到工农兵火热的斗争中去，进一步同工农兵结合。他们和工农兵业余音乐舞蹈工作者一致表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，继续积极参加社会主义文化大革命，同心协力，彻底摧毁反党反社会主义的黑线。他们坚定不移地相信，只要听党中央的话，听毛主席的话，一定能创造出更多、更好的无愧于我们伟大时代的音乐舞蹈，一定能够把这场史无前例的社会主义文化大革命进行到底，取得彻底胜利！　（新华社上海一日电）
