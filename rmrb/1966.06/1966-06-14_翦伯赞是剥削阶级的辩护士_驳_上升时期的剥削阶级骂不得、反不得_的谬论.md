    Jian Bozan, in his bourgeois trash of "historicism," holds an extremely reactionary view – that exploiting classes in their ascendant period cannot be criticized or opposed. For years, he has been using this reactionary viewpoint to launch frantic attacks against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

    How should we treat exploiting classes in their ascendant period? Should we expose and criticize them, or should we praise and glorify them? There is a fundamental difference between proletarian revolutionaries and bourgeois royalists.

    Exploiting Classes in the Ascendant Period Also Eat People

    Jian Bozan opposes exposing and criticizing exploiting classes in their ascendant period, arguing that "from the viewpoint of historicism, any exploiting system or exploiting class has played a progressive role in its ascendant period." We believe that although exploiting classes in their ascendant period have played a certain progressive role in history, in terms of their class nature, they have always been oppressors and exploiters, always devouring people with open mouths.

    First, let's look at the early period of Chinese feudal society – the Qin Dynasty. "The rich possessed fields stretching for miles, while the poor had no place to stand," and the landlords' exploitation rate of peasants was as high as two-thirds or more. The working people were not only subjected to cruel economic exploitation but also suffered cruel political persecution. Under the Qin Dynasty's cruel economic exploitation and political persecution, the broad masses of people "wore the clothes of cattle and horses and ate the food of dogs and pigs," and everywhere there were shocking scenes of "the dead looking at each other" and "the dead being measured by ditches." This is a bloody historical picture of people eating people! Why does Jian Bozan, who styles himself a "Marxist historian," turn a blind eye and remain silent about it?

    Let's look at the ascendant stage of capitalism. The bourgeoisie showed an extremely brutal, cannibalistic nature during the period of primitive accumulation. They used violent means such as conquest, plunder, and slaughter to force producers and the means of production to separate, concentrating wealth in their own hands. The English enclosure movement, known as "sheep eating men," was the cannibalistic movement of the newly born bourgeoisie. After peasants and handicraftsmen were driven into factories, the exploitation and oppression by capitalists became even more shocking. Adult workers labored about twenty hours a day, sometimes working continuously for forty or fifty hours. Children as young as six or seven worked fifteen or sixteen hours a day. Workers' working conditions were extremely poor, wages were low, and living conditions were terrible. All of these were cannibalistic crimes of the bourgeoisie in its ascendant period. Marx pointed out long ago that the history of the laborer being expropriated by capital "is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire" (Marx, *Capital*, Volume One). Why does Jian Bozan, who boasts of being a "Marxist historian," disregard the bloody facts?

    In order to peddle the black goods of so-called exploiting classes in their ascendant period having only progressiveness and no reaction, Jian Bozan blatantly nonsense that "the rule of the landlord class is always better than the rule of the slave owners." According to this "theory," it goes without saying that the rule of the bourgeoisie is of course better than the rule of the landlord class. What is this? Although every newly emerging exploiting system in history has seen some development in production compared to the previous system, it is by no means better for the working people than the previous system. Because, under the rule of the exploiting classes, only the exploiting classes benefit from the fruits of production development and historical progress, while the working people have no hope. Engels said it well: "Every advance in production is at the same time a step backwards in the condition of the oppressed class, that is, of the great majority." (Engels, *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*) Jian Bozan insists that the rule of the landlord class is better than the rule of the slave owners and that the rule of the bourgeoisie is better than the rule of the landlord class, and his defense of the exploiting classes has simply reached a fever pitch.

    A wolf will always eat people, no matter how wonderfully Jian Bozan praises the exploiting classes in their ascendant period. The bloody history of the exploiting classes eating people in their ascendant period cannot be tampered with, and their reactionary nature of exploiting and oppressing the people cannot be concealed. The cannibalistic nature of all exploiting classes is born in their mother's womb. The more vigorously Jian Bozan whitewashes them, the more he exposes his own face as a defender of the exploiting classes.

    The People Must Criticize and Oppose the Exploiting Classes

    Another reason why Jian Bozan believes that "exploiting classes in the ascendant period cannot be criticized or opposed" is that "if one opposes this class and this system as soon as they appear in history, wouldn't that be opposing the development of history?" He even said that "only by standing on the position of the slave owners can one oppose the newly emerging feudal system."

    According to Jian Bozan's view, the peasant uprising heroes of the ascendant period of Chinese feudal society should all be classified as reactionaries because they opposed the ascendant feudal system and opposed the newly emerging landlord class. Comrade Mao Zedong warmly praised the peasants, saying that only their class struggle and revolutionary war "are the real motive force of historical development." Isn't Jian Bozan's cursing of those peasant uprisings that resisted the newly emerging landlord class an open confrontation with Mao Zedong Thought?

    According to Jian Bozan's view, all proletarian revolutionary heroes before the Paris Commune in 1871 should be classified as reactionaries because they opposed the ascendant capitalist system and opposed the newly emerging bourgeoisie. But Marx and Engels both warmly praised them and actively participated in their struggles. Isn't Jian Bozan's disgust with the proletariat's struggle against the newly emerging bourgeoisie a departure from Marxism?

    We believe that the struggle of the working people against the exploiting classes who exploit and oppress them is absolutely correct and completely reasonable at all times!

    The working people's opposition to the exploiting classes in their ascendant period is entirely forced upon them by the exploiting classes themselves. As mentioned earlier, all exploiting classes inherently possess a reactionary nature and are the biggest exploiters and oppressors of the working people from the very beginning. Where there is exploitation, there is resistance; where there is oppression, there is struggle. Since the exploiting classes impose cruel exploitation and oppression on the working people, why can't the working people rise up to resist? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago that the so-called "excessive" behavior of the peasants "is all forced upon them by the local tyrants and evil gentry, and the lawless landlords. The local tyrants and evil gentry, and the lawless landlords, have always relied on their power to dominate and trample on the peasants, and only then do the peasants have this great resistance." (*Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan*) Faced with bone-sucking exploitation, the working people can only fight against the exploiting classes in order to obtain their right to survive; otherwise, they can only be slaughtered and wait for death. Why did Chen Sheng and Wu Guang raise their arms in revolt? It was because the tyrannical Qin King wanted to kill them, and they wanted to fight for survival. Why did the early proletariat destroy machines and smash factories? It was also because they could not tolerate the inhumane treatment of the bourgeoisie. If we were to act according to Jian Bozan's "historicism," we could not resist the exploiting classes in their ascendant period at all. Wouldn't that be asking Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, along with their class brothers, to stretch their necks to be executed? Wouldn't that be asking the early proletariat to accept their fate meekly? Please tell me, Jian Bozan, if this is not the tone of a defender of the exploiting classes, then what is it?

    The struggle of the working people against the exploiting classes in their ascendant period is not only not "opposing the development of history," but it promotes social progress. As is well known, people are the decisive factor in the productive forces, and the working people are the greatest productive force. The exploiting classes' greedy exploitation and cruel oppression inevitably severely undermine the working people and destroy the social productive forces. The working people's resistance to the exploiting classes at any period always protects the productive forces and promotes the development of history. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "The result of every major peasant uprising and peasant war was a blow to the feudal rule of the time, and thus more or less promoted the development of social productive forces." (*The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party*) Therefore, the label of "opposing the development of history" can only be put on the heads of bourgeois royalists like Jian Bozan.

    It should also be pointed out that the struggle of the working people against the exploiting classes in their ascendant period is a necessary stage and component part of their entire struggle against the exploiting classes. The class struggle in human society is a gradually advancing process, a process of gradual development from the primary stage to the advanced stage. Without the primary stage of the movement, there is no advanced stage. Without the early proletarian revolutionary struggle, there could be no later proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship that fundamentally overthrew capitalism and established socialism. Therefore, Jian Bozan's attack on the early struggle of the working people against the exploiting classes is an attack on the entire struggle of the working people against the exploiting classes, and it fundamentally defends the exploiting classes.

    In fact, Jian Bozan not only believes that the exploiting classes in their ascendant period cannot be criticized or opposed; he also does not allow the exploiting classes in their declining period to be criticized or opposed. He shamelessly said that even in the period when the exploiting classes are heading for collapse, one cannot criticize them to the end. Because in any dark period, there is always "a ray of light," otherwise history would stop developing. Look, how absurd Jian Bozan's reasons for defending the exploiting classes are! We will not talk about the slave-owning classes and landlord classes in the period of collapse in history, because history has long made a conclusion about them. No matter how much "light" Jian Bozan gives them, it cannot bring them back to life. Let's just look at the current decaying imperialist system. Lenin pointed out that imperialism is the last stage of capitalism, a decaying, parasitic, and dying capitalism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the days of imperialism are numbered, and they are getting worse and worse. Jian Bozan wants to use the preaching that the exploiting system in the period of collapse has "a ray of light" to prevent the revolutionary people of the world from opposing imperialism, which is futile.

    The People are Forever the Creators of History

    Jian Bozan clamors that the exploiting classes in the ascendant stage cannot be criticized, and the exploiting classes in the period of collapse cannot be criticized either; he even threatens with alarmist words that if the exploiting classes are criticized, history will become "pale and colorless," becoming "an accumulation of sins," becoming "a pile of garbage." It can be seen that in Jian Bozan's mind, it is the exploiting classes who create history, while the broad masses of working people are "rabble" who do nothing.

    This is a thoroughly reactionary view that opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought.

    The people are the creators of history, and all material wealth is created by the hands of the working people. It is their productive struggle that promotes the development of society. The working people are not only the creators of material wealth but also the creators of spiritual wealth. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In China, only the landlords have always had culture, and the peasants have no culture. But the culture of the landlords is created by the peasants, because what creates the culture of the landlords is nothing else but the blood and sweat plundered from the peasants." (*Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan*) With the practical activities of the working people, the splendid scientific culture in history emerged.

    Jian Bozan, who calls himself a "Marxist historian," violates this basic principle of historical materialism. He ignores the ironclad fact that the working people create history, forcibly records the great contribution of the working people to creating history in the merit book of the exploiting classes, and degrades the true masters of creating history into Adou who do nothing. This is simply a crime!

    In fact, not only material wealth and spiritual civilization are created by the working people, but also the replacement of each historical period. What plays a decisive role is still the broad masses of working people, not the rising exploiting classes. When the slave society was already corrupt, it was the slave uprisings that enabled the feudal landlord class to replace the rule of the slave-owning class. When the feudal system had collapsed, it was the anti-feudal struggle of the broad masses of workers and peasants that made it possible for the bourgeoisie to replace the feudal landlord class and gain a ruling position. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "From Chen Sheng and Wu Guang of the Qin Dynasty... to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of the Qing Dynasty, a total of hundreds of uprisings, large and small, were peasant resistance movements, peasant revolutionary wars... In Chinese feudal society, only this class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and the peasant wars are the real motive force of historical development." (*The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party*)

    Jian Bozan's attempt to obliterate the great contribution of the working masses in creating history and shake the position of the working people as masters of history is futile. The result is only to expose himself as a thorough defender of the exploiting classes and a bourgeois royalist.

                      ＊　＊　＊

    Uglyfying the working people and praising the exploiting classes, in the great era of socialist revolution and socialist construction, is to disarm the proletariat and the working masses ideologically and pave the way for capitalist restoration. Whether Jian Bozan agrees or not, the logic of history can only be this, and the conclusion of history is already this.

    翦伯赞是剥削阶级的辩护士
    ——驳“上升时期的剥削阶级骂不得、反不得”的谬论
    李善明　杜春贤　朱占习
    翦伯赞在他所贩卖的资产阶级私货“历史主义”中，有一个极端反动的观点——上升时期的剥削阶级是骂不得、反不得的。多少年来，他一直用这一反动观点向党、向社会主义、向毛泽东思想猖狂进攻。
    应当怎样对待上升时期的剥削阶级？是揭露批判，还是赞美歌颂？无产阶级革命派和资产阶级保皇派之间是有根本分歧的。
    上升时期的剥削阶级也是吃人的
    翦伯赞反对揭露和批判上升时期的剥削阶级，其理由是：“从历史主义的观点看来，任何剥削制度、剥削阶级都曾经在它的上升时期起过进步作用。”我们认为，上升时期的剥削阶级虽然在历史上起过一定的进步作用，但就其阶级本性说，它始终是压迫者和剥削者，始终是张口吃人的。
    先看中国封建社会的初期——秦代。“富者田连阡陌，贫者无立锥之地”，地主对农民的剥削率高达三分之二以上。劳动人民不仅受到残酷的经济剥削，而且还遭到残酷的政治迫害。在秦王朝残酷的经济剥削和政治迫害之下，广大人民群众“衣牛马之衣，食犬彘之食”，到处是“死者相望”、“死人以沟量”的惊心景象。这是一幅血淋淋的人吃人的历史图画！自封为“马克思主义史学家”的翦伯赞，为什么视而不见，讳莫如深呢？
    再看资本主义的上升阶段。资产阶级在原始积累时期，就表现了极端残暴的吃人本性。他们用征服、掠夺和杀戮等暴力手段强迫生产者和生产资料分离，把财富集中在自己手里。被称为“羊吃人”的英国圈地运动就是刚刚出世的资产阶级吃人的运动。农民和手工业者被赶进工厂以后，资本家的剥削和压迫更是骇人听闻。成年工人每日劳动二十小时左右，有时甚至连续工作四、五十小时。六、七岁的童工每天劳动十五、六小时。工人的劳动条件极坏，工资低下，生活恶劣。凡此种种都是资产阶级上升时期的吃人罪行。马克思早就指出，劳动者被资本剥夺的历史“是用血与火的文字，写在人类的编年史中的”（马克思：《资本论》第一卷）。自诩为“马克思主义史学家”的翦伯赞，为什么无视血淋淋的事实？
    翦伯赞为了兜售所谓上升时期的剥削阶级只有进步性而无反动性的黑货，公然胡说什么“地主阶级的统治比奴隶主的统治总要好些”。按照这一“理论”，不言而喻，资产阶级的统治比地主阶级的统治当然也要好些了。这是什么话？历史上每一个新出现的剥削制度，虽然比前一个制度生产有所发展，但是对劳动人民来说，决不是比前一个制度好。因为，在剥削阶级统治下，生产发展、历史进步的果实，只有剥削阶级才有份，劳动人民是无望的。恩格斯说得好：“生产的每一进步，同时也就是被压迫阶级即大多数人的生活状况的一个退步。”（恩格斯：《家庭、私有制和国家的起源》）翦伯赞硬说地主阶级的统治比奴隶主的统治好，资产阶级的统治比地主阶级的统治好，其为剥削阶级作辩护，简直达到了狂热的地步了。
    狼走千里就是要吃人，不管翦伯赞把上升时期的剥削阶级吹捧得多么美妙，上升时期剥削阶级血淋淋的吃人历史是篡改不了的，它们剥削和压迫人民的反动本性是掩盖不住的。一切剥削阶级的吃人本性是从娘肚子里带来的。翦伯赞愈是卖力地为之粉饰，就愈是暴露了自己作为剥削阶级辩护士的嘴脸。
    人民对剥削阶级就是要骂，要反
    翦伯赞认为“上升时期的剥削阶级骂不得、反不得”的另一个理由是：“如果当这个阶级、这个制度一出现于历史就反对它们，岂不是反对历史的发展。”他甚至说，“只有站在奴隶主的立场，才反对新出现的封建制”。
    按照翦伯赞的观点，中国封建社会上升时期的农民起义英雄们，都该划为反动派，因为他们反对了上升时期的封建制度，反对了新兴的地主阶级。毛泽东同志热情地歌颂农民，称道只有他们进行的阶级斗争和革命战争，“才是历史发展的真正动力”。翦伯赞如此诅咒那些反抗新兴地主阶级的农民起义，岂不是公开和毛泽东思想对抗么？
    按照翦伯赞的观点，一八七一年巴黎公社以前的所有无产阶级革命英雄们，都该划为反动派，因为他们反对了上升时期的资本主义制度，反对了新兴的资产阶级。可是马克思和恩格斯都热情地赞扬他们，并积极地参加了他们的斗争。翦伯赞如此厌恶无产阶级反对新兴资产阶级的斗争，难道不是和马克思主义背道而驰吗？
    我们认为，劳动人民反对剥削和压迫自己的剥削阶级的斗争，在任何时候都是绝对正确、完全合理的！
    劳动群众反对上升时期的剥削阶级，完全是剥削阶级自己逼出来的。如前所述，一切剥削阶级先天就具有反动本性，一开始就是劳动人民最大的剥削者和压迫者。哪里有剥削，哪里就有反抗；哪里有压迫，哪里就有斗争。既然剥削阶级强加在劳动人民头上的是残酷的剥削和压迫，劳动人民为什么不能起来进行反抗？毛泽东同志早就指出，所谓农民的行为“过分”，“都是土豪劣绅、不法地主自己逼出来的。土豪劣绅、不法地主，历来凭藉势力称霸，践踏农民，农民才有这种很大的反抗。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）面对着敲骨吸髓的压榨，劳动人民只有起来和剥削阶级作斗争，才能获得自己的生存权利；否则只有任其宰割，束手待毙。陈胜、吴广为什么要揭竿而起？那是因为暴虐无道的秦王要杀他们的头，他们要争取生存。初期无产阶级为什么要破坏机器、捣毁工厂？也是因为他们不能忍受资产阶级的非人待遇。如果按照翦伯赞的“历史主义”办事，根本不能反抗上升时期的剥削阶级，那岂不是要陈胜、吴广连同自己的阶级弟兄引颈就戮吗？那岂不是要早期的无产阶级逆来顺受吗？请问翦伯赞，这不是剥削阶级辩护士的腔调，又是什么呢？
    劳动群众反对上升时期的剥削阶级，不仅不是什么“反对历史发展”，反而会推动社会前进。如所周知，人是生产力中决定的因素，劳动群众是最大的生产力。剥削阶级贪婪的剥削和残酷的压榨，必然严重地摧残劳动群众，破坏社会生产力。劳动人民对任何时期的剥削阶级的反抗，总是保护了生产力，推动了历史的发展。毛泽东同志早就指出：“每一次较大的农民起义和农民战争的结果，都打击了当时的封建统治，因而也就多少推动了社会生产力的发展。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）因此，“反对历史发展”的大帽子只能戴在翦伯赞之流的资产阶级保皇派自己头上。
    还需指出，劳动人民反对上升时期的剥削阶级的斗争，是他们反对剥削阶级的整个斗争的必要的阶段和组成部分。人类社会的阶级斗争是一个逐步前进的过程，是一个由初级阶段逐步发展到高级阶段的过程。没有运动的初级阶段，就没有高级阶段。没有初期的无产阶级的革命斗争，也就不可能有后来的根本推翻资本主义、建立社会主义的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。因此，翦伯赞攻击劳动人民反抗剥削阶级的初期斗争，就是攻击劳动人民反抗剥削阶级的整个斗争，就是从根本上维护剥削阶级。
    其实，翦伯赞不仅认为上升时期的剥削阶级是骂不得、反不得的；对于没落时期的剥削阶级，他也是不准骂、不准反的。他恬不知耻地说：就是在剥削阶级走向崩溃的时期，也不能一骂到底。因为在任何黑暗时期，总有“一线光明”，否则历史就停止了发展。请看，翦伯赞为剥削阶级辩护的理由是何等荒谬绝伦！我们且不谈历史上处于崩溃时期的奴隶主阶级、地主阶级，因为历史早就给它们作出了结论，不管翦伯赞把多少“光明”赋予它们，也不能使它们起死回生了。这里只来看看现今腐朽的帝国主义制度。列宁指出，帝国主义是资本主义的最后阶段，是腐朽的寄生的垂死的资本主义。毛泽东同志指出，帝国主义的日子不会很长久了，日子越来越不好过了。翦伯赞想以崩溃时期的剥削制度有“一线光明”的说教来要世界革命人民不反对帝国主义，那是徒劳的。
    人民群众永远是历史的创造者
    翦伯赞叫嚷上升阶段的剥削阶级骂不得，崩溃时期的剥削阶级也骂不得；他甚至危言耸听地威胁说，骂了剥削阶级，历史就变得“苍白无色”，成了“罪恶的堆积”，成了“一堆垃圾”。可见，在翦伯赞的心目中，创造历史的是剥削阶级，而广大劳动群众则是无所作为的“群氓”。
    这是彻头彻尾的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反动观点。
    人民群众是历史的创造者，一切物质财富都是由劳动人民的双手创造的，正是他们所从事的生产斗争，促进了社会的发展。劳动群众不仅是物质财富的创造者，而且是精神财富的创造者。毛泽东同志说，“中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。”（《湖南农民运动考察报告》）有了劳动群众的实践活动，才出现了历史上辉煌灿烂的科学文化。
    自居为“马克思主义史学家”的翦伯赞，却违背历史唯物主义的这一基本原理。他无视劳动人民创造历史的铁一般的事实，把劳动人民创造历史的伟大贡献，硬记在剥削阶级的功劳簿上，而把创造历史的真正主人贬低为无所作为的阿斗，这简直是犯罪！
    事实上，不但物质财富和精神文明都是劳动人民创造的，就是每一历史时期的更替，起决定作用的仍然是广大的劳动人民，而不是什么上升的剥削阶级。当着奴隶社会已经腐朽时，正是奴隶起义，才使封建地主阶级能够代替奴隶主阶级的统治。当着封建制度已经崩溃时，正是广大工农群众的反封建斗争，才使资产阶级有可能代替封建地主阶级，取得统治地位。毛泽东同志说：“从秦朝的陈胜、吴广……直至清朝的太平天国，总计大小数百次的起义，都是农民的反抗运动，都是农民的革命战争。……在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”（《中国革命和中国共产党》）
    翦伯赞妄想抹杀劳动群众创造历史的伟大贡献，动摇劳动人民在历史上的主人翁的地位，是徒劳无益的，结果只是暴露了他自己是一个道道地地的剥削阶级辩护士，是一个资产阶级的保皇派。
                      ＊　＊　＊
    丑化劳动人民，颂扬剥削阶级，这在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大时代，就是要解除无产阶级和劳动群众的思想武装，为资本主义复辟铺平道路。不管翦伯赞同意不同意，历史的逻辑只能是这样，历史的结论已经是这样。
