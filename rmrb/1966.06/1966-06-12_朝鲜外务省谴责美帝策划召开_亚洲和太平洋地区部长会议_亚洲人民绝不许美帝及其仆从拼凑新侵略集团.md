    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 10th, sternly condemning and exposing the sinister plot of US imperialism to convene the so-called "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific Region" in Seoul.
    The statement said that it is reported that the so-called "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific Region," with the participation of Japan, the Philippines, "Malaysia," Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the Park Chung-hee puppet clique, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the South Vietnamese puppets, will be held in Seoul on June 14th. The purpose of this "meeting" is for the US imperialists to attempt to cobble together a new aggressive military alliance to oppose the people of Asia and the Pacific region.
    The Park Chung-hee clique openly clamored that they would discuss the establishment of a "collective security mechanism to ensure the Asian region" and "joint support" for US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam at this "meeting." This clearly exposes the purpose that US imperialism is pursuing at this meeting.
    The statement said that cobbling together military blocs and alliances is an important pillar of US imperialism's policy of aggression. US imperialism gathers its vassal states and puppets into such blocs and alliances, politically, economically, and militarily controls them, and uses them to carry out aggression against other countries.
    The statement said that since the signing of the "South Korea-Japan Treaty," US imperialism has been pushing its conspiracy to form a single "anti-communist military alliance" in Asia more comprehensively.
    In particular, after suffering repeated shameful defeats in the criminal war of aggression against the Vietnamese people and falling into an inescapable predicament, they have more frantically tried to militarily collude with all the puppet and vassal states in Asia and the Pacific region and pull their troops to South Vietnam in greater numbers.
    The statement said that in realizing this policy of aggression, US imperialism is letting the Sato government of Japan and the Park Chung-hee clique take the lead.
    The Park Chung-hee clique, according to the instructions of US imperialism, has already sent tens of thousands of South Korean young people to the battlefield of aggression in South Vietnam and is attempting to continue to sell them to US imperialism as cannon fodder.
    Park Chung-hee's visit to US running dogs such as "Malaysia," Thailand, and Taiwan in February this year was to conduct conspiratorial activities to form a "regional anti-communist military alliance." The Park Chung-hee clique attempts to exchange its shaky military fascist rule for its ugly acts of treason.
    The statement said that Japanese militarism is more actively following US imperialism's policy of aggression and plotting to rely on US imperialism to re-realize the long-bankrupt dream of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Japanese militarism is actively participating in US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam by providing military bases, supplying weapons and military supplies, and all other means, and is directly acting as a "salesman" for US imperialism's "peace talks" trick.
    Japanese militarism is also carrying out political, economic, ideological, and cultural penetration into Asian countries under various guises such as "aid," "joint development," and "economic and technical cooperation," opening up its aggressive territory.
    The statement pointed out that no means by US imperialism and its lackeys can conceal the aggressive nature of this "meeting." This "meeting" is an aggressive meeting held directly at the instigation of US imperialism’s lackeys and running dogs, with the purpose of realizing its overall strategic plan for Asia.
    The statement pointed out that the convening of this "meeting" is another blatant act of provocation against the people of Asia and peace-loving people all over the world. The people of Asia and the Pacific region will never allow this new aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to be realized.
    The statement said that the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people will wage a resolute struggle against the "Ministerial Meeting for Asia and the Pacific Region," which poses a new threat to peace in Asia and the world.
    If US imperialism and its running dogs insist on holding this meeting despite the strong opposition of the people of Asia and peace-loving people all over the world, they will inevitably be met with unanimous condemnation by the people and will bear full responsibility for all the consequences that arise.

### 朝鲜外务省谴责美帝策划召开“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”  亚洲人民绝不许美帝及其仆从拼凑新侵略集团

    朝鲜外务省谴责美帝策划召开“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”
    亚洲人民绝不许美帝及其仆从拼凑新侵略集团
    新华社平壤十日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省十日发表声明，严厉谴责和揭露美帝国主义策划的将在汉城举行的所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”的罪恶阴谋。
    声明说，据报道，由日本、菲律宾、“马来西亚”、泰国、澳大利亚、新西兰、朴正熙傀儡集团、蒋介石集团、南越傀儡等参加的所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”，将于六月十四日在汉城召开。这个“会议”的目的是美帝国主义者企图拼凑新的侵略军事联盟，以反对亚洲和太平洋地区的人民。
    朴正熙集团公然叫嚷将要在这次“会议”上讨论建立“保障亚洲地区集体安全机构”的问题和“共同支援”美帝国主义侵略越南的问题。这就清楚地暴露了美帝国主义在这次会议上所追求的目的。
    声明说，拼凑军事集团和联盟是美帝国主义侵略政策中的重要支柱。美帝国主义把仆从国家和傀儡纠集到这种集团和联盟中去，从政治、经济和军事上加以控制，并利用它们对其它国家进行侵略。
    声明说，在“韩日条约”签订以后，美帝国主义更加全面地推行在亚洲组成单一“反共军事同盟”的阴谋。
    特别是当它们在对越南人民进行的罪恶的侵略战争中接连遭到可耻失败，陷入无法摆脱的困境之后，它们就更加疯狂地力图使亚洲和太平洋地区的所有傀儡和仆从国家从军事上勾结起来，把它们的军队更多地拉到南越去。
    声明说，美帝国主义在实现这种侵略政策方面，正在让日本的佐藤政府和朴正熙集团打先锋。
    朴正熙集团按照美帝国主义的指示，已经把南朝鲜青壮年几万名送到南越的侵略战场上去，并企图继续把他们出卖给美帝国主义充当炮灰。
    朴正熙今年二月访问“马来西亚”、泰国、台湾等美国走狗，就组成“地区性反共军事同盟”进行了阴谋活动。朴正熙集团妄图以丑恶的卖国行为为代价，换取维持它的摇摇欲坠的军事法西斯统治。
    声明说，日本军国主义更加积极地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，并阴谋依靠美帝国主义重新实现早已破产的所谓“大东亚共荣圈”的梦想。日本军国主义利用提供军事基地、供应武器和军需物资等一切手段，积极参加美帝国主义的侵越战争，并且直接充当美帝国主义“和谈”骗局的“推销员”。
    日本军国主义还在“援助”、“共同开发”、“经济技术合作”等各种名义下，向亚洲国家进行政治、经济、思想、文化等各个方面的渗透，开辟它的侵略地盘。
    声明指出，美帝国主义及其仆从的任何手段都掩盖不了这次“会议”的侵略性质。这次“会议”是美帝国主义直接唆使仆从和走狗举行的侵略性会议，其目的是为了实现它对亚洲的总的战略计划。
    声明指出，这个“会议”的召开，是对亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的又一明目张胆的挑衅行径。亚洲及太平洋地区的人民绝不允许美帝国主义和日本反动派的这个新的侵略阴谋得到实现。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民将为反对给亚洲和世界和平造成新威胁的“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”而展开坚决斗争。
    如果美帝国主义及其走狗不顾亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的强烈反对而执意召开这次会议，它们将不可避免地遭到人民的一致谴责，并将对所产生的一切后果负全部责任。
