    Hue and Saigon Buddhists Continue Anti-U.S.-Puppet Demonstrations
    The U.S.-Puppet Clique is Panicked, Intensifies "Mediation" of Puppet Infighting, and Tries to Quell Mass Demonstrations
    Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 5th - News: Buddhists and masses in Hue and Saigon, who have held marches and demonstrations for more than ten consecutive days, have recently continued to take to the streets to demonstrate against the U.S.-puppet clique.
    According to Western news agencies, on the morning of the 3rd, five or six thousand Buddhists and masses in Hue held a demonstration. The scale of the demonstration was much larger than the one that burned the U.S. "consulate" on the 1st. They marched forward in a mighty procession, regardless of the threats and obstructions of a large number of puppet troops. The demonstrators strongly condemned the U.S.-puppet clique's crime of murdering the Buddhist leader Thich Thien Minh. The day before, about 5,000 Buddhists and youths in Saigon, regardless of the suppression by puppet police and soldiers, marched through the streets to hold a funeral for the Buddhist woman who recently self-immolated in protest against the U.S.-puppet rule. The demonstrators angrily beat a special agent who had infiltrated the demonstration and chased a U.S. military police jeep. On the 4th, another nun in Saigon immolated herself; she was the ninth person in South Vietnam in the past eight days to self-immolate in protest against U.S. support for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique.
    In the face of the further upsurge of the movement against the U.S.-puppet clique, the U.S. aggressors were extremely panicked. They tried every means to "mediate" between the two major South Vietnamese puppet groups in infighting.
    According to Western news agency reports, under the planning of the U.S. master, the Nguyen Cao Ky clique has "reconciled" with its political enemy, the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique. Nguyen Chanh Thi announced in Hue on the morning of the 2nd that he had accepted the position of Nguyen Cao Ky's "special envoy" to Hue, and he would be responsible for supervising the implementation of the plan formulated by senior army officers in the (South Vietnam) northern region to restore "order." This plan includes: "Disarming (Hue) students, restoring radio broadcasts, and arresting Viet Cong who are said to have infiltrated the anti-(puppet) government movement." On the same day, two battalions and fourteen tanks of the puppet First Division, originally belonging to the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique, as well as a squadron of armored vehicles, entered Hue, clearing the way for the Nguyen Cao Ky clique to "recover" Hue.
    Despite the various means, including deception and suppression, used by the U.S.-puppet clique, it cannot quell the anti-U.S.-puppet struggle of Buddhists and masses in Saigon, Hue and other places. As of the 4th, students in Hue had not yet handed over the weapons they had used to arm themselves to the puppet First Division. Many patriotic monks, nuns, and Buddhists in Saigon strongly opposed the compromise of the upper echelons of the Buddhist leadership with the Nguyen Cao Ky clique.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd - News: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, tens of thousands of rural and urban people in My Tho, Tan An, Cholon, Bac Lieu, Binh Thuan, Rach Gia and Thu Dau Mot provinces in South Vietnam have recently held rallies and demonstrations one after another, strongly condemning the fascist crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in suppressing the struggle of the South Vietnamese people, demanding that the U.S. troops get out of South Vietnam and demanding the overthrow of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky traitorous clique.
    In My Tho province, on May 25, 2,500 people from Cai Be town and neighboring villages held a demonstration in front of the Cai Be town puppet government office, strongly condemning the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, demanding that the U.S. aggressors go back, and demanding that Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky step down immediately.
    In Tan An province and Cholon province, in the towns of Can Giuoc, Ben Luc, and Thu Thua alone, 4,200 people participated in demonstrations in seven days in May. They held high banners and placards, poured onto the streets in a mighty procession, and constantly shouted slogans such as "U.S. aggressor troops get out of South Vietnam!" and "Down with the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique!"
    In Rach Gia province, on May 5, more than 1,000 rural residents braved the rain to pour into Rach Gia city for a demonstration. The local puppet government was very panicked and hurriedly ordered all puppet government agencies to close their doors. Workers, laborers, students, vendors, and others in Rach Gia city held strikes, class boycotts, and market strikes for three consecutive days from May 13, 14, and 15, strongly condemning the crimes of the U.S. aggressors and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique in massacring the South Vietnamese people.
    Nearly 9,000 workers in the Dau Tieng rubber plantation in Thu Dau Mot province held a rally on the morning of May 19, and then entered the town of Dau Tieng to hold a demonstration against the U.S. and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

### 顺化西贡佛教徒继续举行反美伪示威  美伪集团惊慌失措，加紧“调解”傀儡内讧，力图平息群众示威

    顺化西贡佛教徒继续举行反美伪示威
    美伪集团惊慌失措，加紧“调解”傀儡内讧，力图平息群众示威
    新华社五日讯　西贡消息：一连举行十几天游行示威的顺化和西贡的佛教徒和群众，最近继续上街示威，反对美伪集团。
    据西方通讯社报道，三日早晨，五、六千名顺化市的佛教徒和群众举行示威。示威的规模比一日烧毁美国“领事馆”的那次示威大得多。他们不顾大量伪军的威胁和阻拦，浩浩荡荡地前进。示威者强烈谴责美伪集团谋杀佛教领导人释善明的罪行。在前一天，西贡市约五千名佛教徒和青年不顾伪军警的镇压，穿过市街举行游行示威，为最近因抗议美伪统治而自焚的佛教徒妇女送葬。示威者愤怒殴打了混进游行队伍中的一个特务，并且追逐了一辆美国宪兵吉普车。四日，西贡又有一个尼姑焚身自杀，她是近八天来为抗议美国支持阮高其集团而自焚的南越第九个人。
    在反对美伪集团运动进一步高涨的情况下，美国侵略者十分惊慌。他们千方百计地给内讧中的两大南越傀儡集团进行“调解”。
    据西方通讯社消息透露，在美国主子的策划下，阮高其集团已同它的政敌阮正诗集团“和解”。阮正诗二日上午在顺化宣布，他已经接受作为阮高其驻顺化“特派代表”的职务，他将负责监督（南越）北部地区陆军高级军官制定的恢复“秩序”的计划的执行。这个计划包括：“解除（顺化）学生的武装，恢复电台的广播，并且逮捕据传渗入反（伪）政府运动的越共”。同一天，原来属于阮正诗集团的伪第一师的两个营和十四辆坦克以及一队装甲车开进了顺化市，为阮高其集团“收复”顺化扫清道路。
    尽管美伪集团玩弄包括欺骗和镇压在内的种种手段，但是它并不能平息西贡和顺化等地佛教徒和群众的反美伪斗争。到四日为止，顺化市的学生仍未向伪第一师交出武装自己的武器。西贡的许多爱国和尚、尼姑和佛教徒都极力反对佛教上层领导同阮高其集团妥协。
    据新华社河内三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方美萩、新安、堤岸、薄寮、平顺、迪石和土龙木等省数以万计的农村和城市人民，最近接连举行集会和示威游行，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗镇压南越人民斗争的法西斯罪行，要求美国军队滚出越南南方，要求打倒阮文绍—阮高其卖国集团。
    在美萩省，五月二十五日，丐礼镇和邻近各个乡的两千五百多人在丐礼镇伪政权办事处前举行示威，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的罪行，要求美国侵略者滚回去，要求阮文绍和阮高其立即下台。
    在新安省和堤岸省，仅芹若、边沥和守承等市镇，在五月分头七天中，就有四千二百人参加了示威游行。他们高举横幅和标语牌，浩浩荡荡地涌上街头，不断高呼：“美国侵略军滚出越南南方！”“打倒阮文绍—阮高其集团！”等口号。
    在迪石省，五月五日，一千多农村居民冒雨涌进迪石市示威游行，当地的伪政权非常惊慌，急忙下令所有的伪政权机关都关上大门。迪石市的工人、劳动人民、学生、商贩等在五月十三、十四、十五日三天中，接连举行罢工、罢课、罢市斗争，强烈谴责美国侵略者和阮文绍—阮高其集团屠杀南越人民的罪行。
    土龙木省油汀橡胶园近九千名工人，在五月十九日早晨举行集会，会后又进入油汀县城，举行反对美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团的示威游行。
