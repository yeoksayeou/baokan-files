    Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought, Great Victory of the General Line of Socialist Construction
    Over a Hundred Small Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants Built Nationwide
    With the exception of a few areas, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions now have small nitrogen fertilizer plants. These newly built and under-construction small nitrogen fertilizer plants are mostly located in county towns or rural market towns, producing and using fertilizer locally, which is very convenient and strengthens the worker-peasant alliance.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 14) In the first five months of this year, more than twenty newly built small nitrogen fertilizer plants in China have been put into production. Together with those put into production in the past, the number of small nitrogen fertilizer plants in production nationwide has exceeded one hundred. Currently, with the exception of a few areas, all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have small nitrogen fertilizer plants. There are also a number of small nitrogen fertilizer plants under construction, which will be put into production successively this year and next year.
    The commissioning of a large number of small chemical fertilizer plants is a victory for China's chemical fertilizer industry in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implementing the general line of socialist construction and the principle of walking on two legs, and is a product of the Great Leap Forward. Practice has proven that small chemical fertilizer plants have strong vitality and can compete with large and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants.
    China's small nitrogen fertilizer plants began to develop from scratch, from few to many, in 1958. In this process, they experienced one arduous and tortuous ideological struggle after another.
    In 1958, in order to open up a path for the high-speed development of the chemical fertilizer industry, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on liberating thought, breaking superstitions, daring to think and daring to act, and in accordance with the central government's policy of simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises, and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, the Ministry of Chemical Industry put forward a specific plan for running chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale. A fierce debate unfolded around this plan. The core issue of the debate was whether China could run small chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale, and the essence was whether or not to run small chemical fertilizer plants. This debate first unfolded in the leading organs. In this debate, the revolutionary faction held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the idea that "nitrogen fertilizer plants can only be large and not small, this is an objective law," "running small plants is a step backwards, it means the regression of industrial level," and other thoughts of worshipping foreign things, opposed the right-leaning conservative thought that "running small plants will inevitably hinder the construction of large plants," and opposed the pessimistic argument that "small plants are technically, economically, and equipment-wise difficult to pass, and the nitrogen fertilizer industry cannot go to the countryside." At that time, although these erroneous ideas had not been completely eliminated, in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, the mass movement of running small chemical fertilizer plants on a large scale quickly unfolded. In a short period of just over a year, after day and night battles, the workers quickly produced four different scales of medium and small nitrogen fertilizer plant designs. Some small nitrogen fertilizer plant designs also adopted new chemical fertilizer production processes, and synthetic ammonia plants of different scales were established according to the designs, and experimental work was carried out. The preliminary results of the experiment proved that the production process of small nitrogen fertilizer plants was basically feasible, and it could produce ammonia and fertilizer, and it was not as difficult to handle as some "authorities" and "experts" asserted. At the same time, various places began to build a batch of small chemical fertilizer plants as models, preparing to gradually promote them after gaining experience. In this way, China's chemical fertilizer industry finally took the first step on the road of high-speed development.
    In 1961, China's national economy was in a period of temporary difficulties. At that time, although many small nitrogen fertilizer plants had been built and could produce products, production was not normal due to various reasons. Under such circumstances, those who originally did not approve of running small chemical fertilizer plants came out to speak. They considered themselves to be "clairvoyant," "most knowledgeable about science," and "most knowledgeable about objective laws," so they spoke plausibly and even made unwarranted accusations. They one-sidedly emphasized that small plants were uneconomical and unreasonable, and opposed continuing to run them. After this gust of cold wind blew out, some comrades, due to a lack of foresight, overemphasized difficulties, and began to doubt whether small chemical fertilizer plants could continue to survive. This caused some units with the conditions to continue running to stop. However, some small chemical fertilizer plants withstood this cold wind, broke through thorns and thistles, adhered to the revolution, adhered to the experiment, and worked hard with the spirit of self-reliance to fight for the right to survive. At this critical moment, the central government issued a call to run agriculture on a large scale and run grain on a large scale, and strengthened the leadership of the chemical fertilizer industry, requiring that small chemical fertilizer plants be run, continue to experiment, and explore experience. Various places also strengthened the leadership of small chemical fertilizer plants, organized forces to seriously summarize the experience of the small nitrogen fertilizer plants that had already been put into production, and carried out thorough rectification.
    The Danyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant in Jiangsu is a small nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 2,000 tons built according to China's first-created new chemical fertilizer production process. During the construction of this plant, unexpected news came: although this new process produced fertilizer, production was extremely abnormal, and it was decided to revise the design and return to the traditional old process. At that time, a batch of small nitrogen fertilizer plants with an annual output of 2,000 tons built according to the new process mostly returned to the traditional old process, but production was still abnormal, and they could not pass the technical and economic barriers. However, the Danyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant insisted on building the plant according to the new process and continued to conduct experiments. They used Chairman Mao's thought, explored production laws in production practice, and constantly summarized experience, and finally broke through the technical and economic barriers, making this new process a success in production practice. The small chemical fertilizer plants learned and developed the experience of the Danyang Chemical Fertilizer Plant, and production embarked on the right track, and successively broke through the technical and economic barriers. In this way, the small nitrogen fertilizer plants finally gained a firm foothold, creating conditions for rapid development.
    The overall improvement of the national economy and the in-depth implementation of the Party's general policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of various places to develop small chemical fertilizer plants, and the work of building new and expanding small chemical fertilizer plants was universally carried out again. At this time, difficulties in equipment manufacturing and raw material supply appeared again. Those who did not actively support small chemical fertilizer plants were worried that the development of small nitrogen fertilizer plants would cause the dispersal of forces, uneconomical investment, and reduce the speed of construction; some were worried that the development of small plants would affect the machinery industry's manufacturing of large and medium-sized chemical fertilizer equipment. This was actually still not admitting the road of developing small chemical fertilizer plants. At this time, the local party committees mobilized internal potential and developed small chemical fertilizer plants in every possible way and through self-reliance, thus enabling small chemical fertilizer plants to achieve new development in the past two years.
    Since 1961, the production capacity of small nitrogen fertilizer plants has almost doubled every year. The proportion of small nitrogen fertilizer plants in the total national output of nitrogen fertilizer has become larger year by year. In 1961, the output of small nitrogen fertilizer plants accounted for only 2% of the total output, in 1965 it rose to 12.4%, and this year it will reach more than 18%. Due to the continuous adoption of new technologies, new equipment, and new processes by small nitrogen fertilizer plants, the technical and economic indicators have reached a new level, many of which are close to or catching up with the level of large chemical fertilizer plants, and some individual indicators have even surpassed the level of large chemical fertilizer plants.
    The new and under-construction small nitrogen fertilizer plants in China are mostly located in county towns or rural market towns, producing and using fertilizer locally, which is very convenient. This has brought about new changes in the political and economic relationship between factories and rural areas, workers and peasants, strengthened the worker-peasant alliance, and the commune members call the factories "our chemical fertilizer plants."
    In recent years, the local party committees have strengthened the leadership of the production and construction of small chemical fertilizer plants. Many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have established chemical fertilizer production and construction headquarters, headed by the provincial party secretary. Some special districts have also established leading groups, headed by the prefectural party secretary. These command institutions are responsible for arranging the construction and production of chemical fertilizer plants. In the past few years, only a few provinces and cities with relatively developed industrial foundations were able to independently design, manufacture complete sets of chemical fertilizer equipment, and independently carry out construction and installation; now, except for a few provinces and autonomous regions, the main equipment of small nitrogen fertilizer plants can be solved independently in the Greater Administrative Region or province.

### 毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利  全国建成上百座小型氮肥厂

    毛泽东思想的伟大胜利　社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利
    全国建成上百座小型氮肥厂
    除个别地区外，各省、市、自治区都有了小型氮肥厂。这些新建和正在兴建的小氮肥厂，绝大多数在县城或农村集镇，就地生产，就地使用，非常方便，并且加强了工农联盟。
    据新华社南京十四日电　今年头五个月，我国又有二十多个新建小型氮肥厂投入生产。连同过去投入生产的在内，全国正在生产的小型氮肥厂已超过一百个。现在除个别地区外，各省、市、自治区都有了小型氮肥厂。目前还有一批小型氮肥厂正在加紧施工，今年、明年将陆续投入生产。
    大批小型化肥厂的投入生产，是我国化肥工业高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线和两条腿走路方针的胜利，是大跃进的产物。实践证明，小化肥厂具有强大的生命力，可以同大中型化肥厂相媲美。
    我国小氮肥厂是一九五八年开始从无到有、从少到多地发展起来的。在这个过程中，经历了一场又一场艰苦、曲折的思想斗争。
    在一九五八年，我国为了开拓一条高速度发展化肥工业的道路，根据毛主席关于解放思想、破除迷信、敢想敢干的教导，按照中央提出的大中小并举，土洋并举的方针，化工部提出了一个大办化肥的具体方案。围绕这个方案，展开了一场激烈的争论。争论的核心问题是我国能不能大办小化肥厂，实质是要不要办小化肥厂。这场争论首先在领导机关中展开。在这场争论中，革命派高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，反对了那种所谓“办氮肥厂只能大不能小，这是一条客观规律”，“办小厂是走回头路，是意味着工业水平的倒退”等等崇洋思想，反对了那种所谓“办小厂就势必妨碍大厂建设”的右倾保守思想，反对了那种认为“小厂技术上、经济上、设备上难过关，氮肥工业不可能下乡”的悲观论点。当时尽管这些错误思想还没有被彻底清除，但是在大跃进的激流里，大办小化肥厂的群众运动却很快掀起来了。在短短一年多的时间里，职工们经过夜以继日的奋战，很快作出了四种不同规模的中小型氮肥厂的设计，有的小氮肥厂的设计还采用了新的化肥生产流程，并且按照设计建立了不同规模的合成氨厂，开展了试验工作。试验的初步结果证明，小氮肥厂的生产流程基本上是可行的，是能够生产出氨和肥料来的，决不象某些“权威”“专家”所断言的那样难办。在这同时，各地都开始兴建一批小型化肥厂作为样板，准备取得经验后逐步推广。这样，我国化肥工业终于在高速度发展的道路上迈开了第一步。
    一九六一年我国国民经济正处于暂时性的困难时期，当时许多小氮肥厂虽然建成了，能生产出产品来了，但是由于种种原因，生产不正常。在这种情况下，原来就不赞成办小化肥厂的人便出来说话了。他们自以为是“先知先觉”“最懂科学”“最懂客观规律”的人，因而振振有词，甚至横加责难。他们片面强调小厂不经济、不合理，反对继续办下去。这股冷风吹出来后，有些同志由于缺乏远见，过多强调困难，也开始怀疑小化肥厂能否继续生存。这样使一些有条件继续办下去的单位也停下来了。但是有些小化肥厂顶住了这股冷风，披荆斩棘，坚持革命，坚持试验，以自力更生的精神为争得生存的权利而艰苦奋斗。在这关键时刻，中央发出了大办农业、大办粮食的号召，并且加强了化肥工业的领导，要求把小化肥厂办下去，继续试验，摸索经验。各地也加强了小化肥厂的领导，组织了力量对已生产的小氮肥厂认真总结经验，进行彻底整顿。
    江苏丹阳化肥厂是按照我国首创的化肥生产新流程建设的年产两千吨型的小氮肥厂。这个厂在建厂过程中，传来了意外的消息：这种新流程虽然生产出了肥料，但生产极不正常，决定修改设计，回到传统的老流程，当时按照新流程建设的一批年产两千吨型的小氮肥厂，大多数回到了传统的老流程，生产仍不正常，过不了技术关、经济关；但是，丹阳化肥厂坚持按照新流程建厂，继续进行试验。他们运用毛主席的思想，在生产实践中摸索生产规律，不断总结经验，终于闯过了技术关、经济关，使这项新流程在生产实践中获得了成功。各小化肥厂学习和发展了丹阳化肥厂的经验，生产走上了正轨，先后闯过了技术关、经济关。这样小氮肥厂终于站稳了脚跟，为大步地向前发展创造了条件。
    国民经济的全面好转，党的以农业为基础、以工业为主导的发展国民经济总方针的深入贯彻，大大鼓舞了各地发展小化肥厂的积极性，新建、扩建小化肥厂的工作又普遍展开。在这个时候，又出现了设备制造和原料供应的困难。那些对小化肥厂不积极支持的人，有的担心小氮肥厂的发展造成力量分散，投资不经济，降低了建设速度；有的担心小的发展了，会影响机械工业制造大中型化肥设备。这实际上还是不承认发展小化肥厂的道路。这时，各地党委动员了内部潜力，千方百计、自力更生地发展小化肥厂，因而使小化肥厂在这两年得到新的发展。
    一九六一年以来，小氮肥厂的生产能力，几乎每年翻一番。小氮肥厂的产量，在全国氮肥总产量中所占比重一年比一年大。一九六一年小氮肥厂的产量只占总产量的百分之二，一九六五年上升到百分之十二点四，今年将达到百分之十八以上。由于小氮肥厂不断采用新技术、新设备、新工艺，技术经济指标达到了一个新的水平，其中有许多接近或赶上大化肥厂的水平，有个别指标还超过了大化肥厂的水平。
    我国新建的和正在兴建的小氮肥厂，绝大多数是在县城或农村集镇，就地生产，就地使用，非常方便。这样使工厂和农村、工人和农民之间的关系，在政治上、经济上发生了新的变化，加强了工农联盟，社员们把工厂称之为“我们的化肥厂”。
    最近几年来，各地党委都加强小化肥厂的生产建设的领导。许多省、市、自治区成立了化肥生产建设指挥部，由省委书记挂帅。有的专区也成立了领导小组，由地委书记担任组长。这些指挥机构，负责安排化肥工厂的建设和生产工作。前几年，只有少数工业基础比较发达的省、市能够自行设计、自行制造成套化肥设备、自行施工安装；现在，除了几个省、自治区外，小氮肥厂的主要设备都可以在大区或省内自行解决了。
