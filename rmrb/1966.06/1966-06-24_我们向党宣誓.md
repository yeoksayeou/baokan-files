    We Pledge to the Party
    The decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination system is like a spring thunder, shaking all directions. Wherever the news spread, there was thunderous applause. Revolutionary masses were overjoyed and filled with passion, writing letters to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smash the old bourgeois education system, sweep away all demons and monsters, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Below is an excerpt from a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao from the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University. Respected Party Central Committee, Respected Chairman Mao:
    When we heard the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination system on the radio, we couldn't suppress the joy and excitement in our hearts. Everyone spread the good news to each other.
    This wise decision of the Party Central Committee is a major measure to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution in the education sector and thoroughly reform our country's education system. This decision speaks our minds, gives us great encouragement, and our hearts are filled with infinite love and gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Currently, the storm of the Cultural Revolution is impacting every corner of Beijing Normal University, washing away the mire of capitalism, revisionism, and feudalism, and shaking the bourgeoisie's rule in our school. The most urgent task before us is to spare no effort to actively participate in the torrent of the Cultural Revolution and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    We deeply know that this Cultural Revolution, which is related to the fate and future of the Party and the country, is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. We are determined to storm the bourgeois strongholds, knock those bourgeois representatives and bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" to the ground. We will not give up until we recapture the cultural and educational positions occupied by the bourgeoisie.
    We are about to graduate from university. It is the Party and the working people who have painstakingly raised us. We infinitely love our dear Party and infinitely love our dear Chairman Mao. Everything we have belongs to the Party and belongs to the people. The cause of the Party and the needs of the proletarian revolution are our highest ideals. We are determined to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the younger generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought, everyone must be a hero who drives away tigers and leopards, and everyone must be a hero who is not afraid of bears.
    We swear to the Party: wherever the Party points, we will fight there. Whether it is now or in the future, we guarantee to unswervingly be vanguards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, take over the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, pass it on, and contribute our lifelong strength to the glorious communist cause.

    我们向党宣誓
    党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定，象一声春雷，震动了四面八方。消息传到那里，那里欢声雷动。革命群众欢欣鼓舞，满腔激情，纷纷给党中央、毛主席写信，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决打碎旧的资产阶级教育制度，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！下面选登一封北京师范大学物理系给党中央、毛主席的信。敬爱的党中央敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们从广播里，听到党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定后，抑制不住内心的喜悦和激动，大家奔走相告这一好消息。
    党中央的这一英明决定是彻底搞好教育界的文化大革命，彻底改革我国教育制度的重大措施。这个决定说出了我们的心里话，给予我们巨大的鼓舞，我们内心充满了对党和毛主席的无限热爱和感激。
    目前，文化大革命的风暴正在冲击着北京师大的每个角落，洗涤着资本主义、修正主义和封建主义的污泥浊水，震撼着资产阶级在我校的统治。摆在我们面前最迫切的任务，就是不遗余力地积极投入到文化大革命的激流中去，将文化大革命进行到底。
    我们深深知道这场关系到党和国家命运及前途的文化大革命，是一场十分尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。我们下定决心去冲击资产阶级顽固堡垒，把那些资产阶级代表人物和资产阶级“学者”“权威”打个落花流水，不夺回被资产阶级霸占的文化教育阵地，我们决不罢休。
    我们就要大学毕业了，是党和劳动人民呕心沥血把我们养大的，我们无限热爱亲爱的党，无限热爱亲爱的毛主席，我们一切的一切，都是属于党，属于人民的。党的事业，无产阶级革命的需要，就是我们的最高理想。我们决心挑起中国革命和世界革命的重担。我们，无产阶级革命事业的接班人，毛泽东思想武装起来的年轻一代，人人要当驱逐虎豹的英雄，个个要做不怕熊罴的豪杰。
    我们向党宣誓：党指向那里，我们就打到那里，无论是现在还是将来，我们保证坚定不移地做无产阶级文化大革命冲锋陷阵的闯将，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗接过来，传下去，为光辉灿烂的共产主义事业贡献我们毕生的力量。
    北京师范大学物理系  应届毕业生
