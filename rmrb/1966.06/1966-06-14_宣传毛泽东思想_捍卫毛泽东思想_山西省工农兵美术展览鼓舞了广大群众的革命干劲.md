    Publicize Mao Zedong Thought, Defend Mao Zedong Thought
    Shanxi Province Worker-Peasant-Soldier Art Exhibition Inspires the Revolutionary Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses

    The Shanxi Province Worker-Peasant-Soldier Art Exhibition, held in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reviewed the new achievements made by amateur worker-peasant-soldier artists in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. It demonstrated the fighting posture of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force of the cultural revolution, and inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses.

    This exhibition, held in Taiyuan, displayed more than 120 works by amateur artists, including traditional Chinese paintings, New Year pictures, propaganda posters, prints, serial cartoons, comic strips, paper cuttings, etc., which were loved by the broad masses of the audience for their strong revolutionary content, fiery fighting spirit, rich atmosphere of real life, and artistic forms that the masses loved to see and hear.

    The amateur worker-peasant-soldier artists who participated in the art exhibition, with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, used their brushes as weapons to participate in this battle to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end, and fiercely countered the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs' vicious attacks on the Party, Chairman Mao, and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Unswervingly publicizing Mao Zedong Thought and unswervingly defending Mao Zedong Thought are the distinct characteristics of this art exhibition. The three propaganda posters created by young worker Xi Qingyu, "Giving Prominence to Politics is the First Priority Among Thousands of Priorities," "Successors First Inherit Mao Zedong Thought," and "Think of Chairman Mao's Teachings When Encountering Difficulties," demonstrated the Chinese working class's high belief in and boundless love for the great Mao Zedong Thought, reflecting the moving scenes of the working masses giving prominence to politics in production and construction and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The print "Before Work," created by farmers Yan Zhaowu and Zhang Jihuang, depicts an old poor peasant with a radiant expression carefully keeping Chairman Mao's works in his pocket before going to work, his love for Chairman Mao's works vividly portrayed on the paper. The print "Old Couple Studying 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong'," the New Year pictures "Quotations Board" and "Spring Planting," and other works also reflect the theme of the worker-peasant-soldier masses eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works and consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective and objective world, powerfully refuting the slander of some so-called bourgeois "authorities" and "scholars" against the worker-peasant-soldier masses' study and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The broad masses of amateur artists also shaped many brilliant images of worker-peasant-soldier heroes of the socialist era, eulogizing the new things, new ideas, new morality, and new customs that have emerged in the three great revolutionary movements. The 14 prints "Ode to the Five-Good" collectively created by the Taiyuan City Workers' Print Group, using the real people and real deeds of the Five-Good pacesetters emerging on the industrial front of Taiyuan City as materials, portrayed their noble spiritual outlook, making the audience strongly feel the Chinese working class's spirit of daring to revolt, daring to win, and the fearless proletarian backbone spirit. Many workers praised this group of prints after seeing it, saying that it "adds to people's drive and increases strength." The New Year picture "Pillar," created by farmer Hu Rugao, enthusiastically praised the thorough revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants and their "pillar" role in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside. The print "When the Bayonet Bends," created by army author Zhao Jing, depicts the revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army soldiers who are invincible, brave and tenacious, and not afraid of hardship or death. Works such as "Field Cooking," "Hard Skills," and "Sharpening Ideological Knives First" highlight the fighting will of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of militiamen who are holding their guns tightly, diligently practicing their skills to kill the enemy, and preparing at all times to smash the aggression of US imperialism, embodying the glorious victory of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and giving a head-on blow to the reactionary fallacies of so-called "deviating from the classics" and opposing "the smell of gunpowder" of bourgeois "authorities"!

    In their creations, the broad masses of worker-peasant-soldier authors emancipated their minds, dared to revolt, and vigorously eliminated the superstition in "experts" and "authorities." Some amateur authors were still "laymen" in the art of painting a few months ago, but the fiery real struggle life and the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of the working people inspired and encouraged them, giving them a strong desire to create. They said: If we don't pick up our pens to depict the ever-changing new appearance of our motherland, if we don't use our pens to eulogize our great Party and our great leader, and if we don't use our pens to express the revolutionary struggle and soaring enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we feel uneasy in our hearts. When they first started painting, some so-called bourgeois painters and "authorities" used techniques to frighten them, but they said: We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of the new socialist culture. As long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, delve into the life of struggle, never separate ourselves from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, break down frameworks, eliminate superstition, and rely on the masses, we will definitely be able to paint the newest and most beautiful pictures in the world. In their creative practice, the worker-peasant-soldier authors, on the one hand, earnestly and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "On New Democracy," which discussed cultural issues, to transform their own thinking with Mao Zedong Thought and guide their creations; on the other hand, they took workshops, fields, and training grounds as classrooms, learning from actual struggles and learning from old poor peasants, old workers, and old soldiers. In order to paint "Field Cooking," which reflects the PLA cooking soldiers' hard training of excellent skills based on the needs of actual combat, print author Zhao Jing braved the severe cold and participated in marches and actual combat exercises with the cooking soldiers in blizzards. More than a dozen amateur authors who participated in the creation of the print "Ode to the Five-Good" worked and fought together with the "Five-Good" pacesetters on the industrial front, jointly studying and creating. This enabled this group of prints to better reveal the spiritual outlook of the heroic model figures.

    Many worker-peasant-soldier authors also dared to break the old artistic frameworks, starting from real life and boldly innovating. When young worker Wang Dexing created the New Year picture "Mother Liu Hulan and the Liu Hulan Group," he began by using the traditional New Year picture technique of "fine brushwork and heavy color" to depict the image of female workers, but many workers criticized the first draft after seeing it, saying: "The female worker is painted like a delicate young lady, without backbone." Based on this feedback, Wang Dexing boldly innovated and finally more successfully expressed the character of the workers.

    This art exhibition was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said: These paintings are our own paintings, they depict our wishes and ideals, and they depict our ambition and strength. When we look at these paintings, our revolutionary spirit is greatly boosted, and our enthusiasm is doubled. Some PLA soldiers wrote down the following thoughts after visiting the art exhibition: Today, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have truly become masters of their own affairs, and they are the main force on the cultural front who have mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely be able to disarm those so-called "authorities," and use our hands that hold hammers, our hands that hold hoes, and our hands that hold guns to pick up pens and open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs!

    宣传毛泽东思想　捍卫毛泽东思想
    山西省工农兵美术展览鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中举行的山西省工农兵美术展览，检阅了工农兵业余美术作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务方面所取得的新成果，显示出广大工农兵作为文化革命主力军的战斗姿态，鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲。
    这个在太原举行的展览会共展出了业余作者的国画、年画、宣传画、版画、连环画、漫画、剪纸等一百二十余件，以强烈的革命内容，火热的战斗精神，浓厚的现实生活气息和群众喜闻乐见的艺术形式，受到广大观众的喜爱。
    参加画展的工农兵业余美术作者，怀着对党对毛主席无比热爱的心情，以画笔为武器，参加了这场捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想、捍卫无产阶级专政的战斗，表现了广大工农兵把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的英雄气概，狠狠地回击了反党反社会主义黑帮对党、对毛主席和无产阶级专政的恶毒攻击。
    坚定不移地宣传毛泽东思想，坚定不移地捍卫毛泽东思想，是这次画展的鲜明特色。青年工人席青于创作的《千条万条突出政治第一条》、《接班先接毛泽东思想》和《遇到困难想想毛主席教导》三幅宣传画，表现了我国工人阶级对伟大的毛泽东思想的高度信仰和无比热爱，反映了工人群众在生产建设中突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的动人情景。农民阎照吾、张吉煌创作的版画《上工前》，描绘一位神采焕发的老贫农出工前把毛主席著作珍藏在口袋里，他热爱毛主席著作的神情跃然纸上。版画《老俩口学〈毛泽东选集〉》，年画《语录牌》、《春播》等作品，也都反映了工农兵群众如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，自觉地运用毛泽东思想去改造主、客观世界的主题，有力地反击了某些所谓资产阶级“权威”、“学者”对工农兵学习和掌握毛泽东思想的污蔑。
    广大业余作者还塑造了许多社会主义时代工农兵英雄的光辉形象，讴歌了三大革命运动中涌现出来的新事物，新思想，新道德，新风尚。太原市职工版画组集体创作的十四幅版画《五好赞》，以太原市工业战线上涌现出来的五好标兵的真人真事为素材，刻划了他们崇高的精神面貌，使观众强烈地感染到中国工人阶级敢于革命，敢于胜利，天不怕，地不怕的无产阶级硬骨头精神。许多工人看了以后赞扬这组版画“使人添干劲，增力量”。农民胡汝高创作的年画《台柱子》，热情歌颂了贫农下中农的彻底革命精神和他们在农村三大革命运动中的“台柱子”作用。部队作者赵荆创作的版画《当刺刀弯了的时候》、描绘了解放军战士有我无敌、勇猛顽强、不怕苦不怕死的革命英雄主义精神。《野炊》、《硬功》、《先磨思想刀》等作品，突出了解放军指战员和广大民兵紧握手中枪，苦练杀敌本领，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的侵略的战斗意志，体现了毛主席人民战争思想的光辉胜利，给所谓“离经背道”、反“火药味”等资产阶级“权威”的反动谬论以当头棒喝！
    广大工农兵作者在创作中解放思想，敢于革命，大力破除对“专家”、“权威”的迷信。有些业余作者几个月前还是绘画艺术的“门外汉”，但火热的现实斗争生活和广大劳动人民的革命精神，激励和鼓舞着他们，使他们产生了强烈的创作欲望。他们说：不拿起笔来描绘日新月异的祖国新貌，不用笔去歌颂我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖，不用笔去表现工农兵的革命斗争和冲天干劲，心里就感到不安。他们刚学画时，有些所谓资产阶级画家和“权威”用技巧来吓唬他们，但是他们说：我们工农兵是社会主义新文化的主人。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，突出政治，深入斗争生活，永远不脱离工农兵，打破框框，破除迷信，依靠群众，我们就一定能画出世界上最新最美的图画来。工农兵作者在创作实践中，一面认真地反复地学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《新民主主义论》中关于文化问题的论述，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，指导创作；另一方面以车间、田头、练兵场为课堂，向实际斗争学习，向老贫农、老工人、老战士学习。版画作者赵荆为了画好反映部队炊事兵从实战需要出发苦练过硬本领的《野炊》，曾冒着严寒在暴风雪中同炊事兵一起参加行军和实战演习。参加版画《五好赞》创作的十多位业余作者和工业战线上的“五好”标兵工作、战斗在一起，共同研究创作。使这组版画较好地揭示了英雄模范人物的精神面貌。
    许多工农兵作者还敢于打破陈旧的艺术框框，从现实生活出发，大胆创新。青年工人王德兴在创作年画《刘胡兰妈妈和刘胡兰小组》时，开始用“工笔重彩”的传统年画技法描绘女工形象，许多工人看了初稿以后批评说：“女工画得象个娇小姐，没有骨气。”王德兴根据这个意见，大胆创新，终于较成功地表现了工人的性格。
    这次画展受到广大工农兵的热烈欢迎。他们说：这些画是我们自己的画，它们画出了我们的心愿和理想，画出了我们的志气和力量。一看这些画，我们革命精神大振，干劲倍增。有的解放军战士参观画展后写下了这样的感想：今天广大工农兵已经真正当家做了主人，并且是掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的文化战线上的主力军。我们一定能够缴掉那些所谓“权威”的械，用我们拿鎯头的手，拿锄头的手，拿枪杆子的手，拿起笔来，向反党反社会主义的黑帮开火！　（新华社）
