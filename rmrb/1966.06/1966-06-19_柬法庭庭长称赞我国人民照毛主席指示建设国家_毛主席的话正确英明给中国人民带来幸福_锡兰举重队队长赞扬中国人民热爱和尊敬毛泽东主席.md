    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, June 17th.  Mr. Kochum, President of the People's Court of Cambodia and a member of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation who recently returned from a visit to China, told Xinhua reporters on June 14th: The entire Chinese people listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are working hard with boundless enthusiasm to build their country. The Chinese people clearly know that Chairman Mao's words are correct and wise and can bring a good and happy life to the Chinese people. That is why the entire Chinese people act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.
    Kochum spoke with great enthusiasm and excitement about the visit of the Cambodian delegation to a people's commune in the suburbs of Shanghai and their visit to a commune member's home. He said that the lives of the people's commune members are very good, and almost all families have savings. The living conditions of the people's commune members are also good. He said with emotion: All these facts I have seen with my own eyes and learned about myself. He said that some people say that the lives of the Chinese people are poor, that they have nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and cannot even drink clear soup; it is clear that this is malicious slander by the enemy.

He said that the people's communes carried out deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, field management was very well done, water conservancy projects were also well done, and attention was paid to eliminating diseases and pests. He said that he was extremely impressed by the spirit of hard struggle and thrift of the commune members.
    Kochum also talked about the delegation's visits to Anshan and Changchun and praised the tremendous progress China has made in industry. He said that now China does not import oil, gasoline, or internal combustion engine fuel and can be self-sufficient. He said that this visit to ten provinces and cities made me sincerely admire the achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects of national construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo.  Gideon Ranasinghe, honorary secretary of the Ceylon Weightlifting Association and captain of the Ceylon weightlifting team, which recently participated in the 1966 Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitational Tournament held in Beijing, praised the Chinese people for their love and respect for Chairman Mao Zedong.
