    Editor's Note: Promoting the People's Liberation Army's experience in flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings is the most fundamental way to raise the proletariat consciousness of farmers and promote the ideological revolutionization of farmers.
    Chairman Mao said: "The serious problem is the education of the peasants." What should be used to educate the peasants, transform the peasants, and revolutionize the ideology of the broad masses of peasants? Decades of revolutionary practice in our country have proved that the only effective weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of peasants have the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao's books. They understand that to carry the socialist revolution through to the end and to build our country stronger and better, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.
    The transformation of world outlook is the most fundamental transformation. Educating the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, transforming their old world outlook, and establishing a communist world outlook will surely educate the broad masses of peasants in our country into a highly proletarianized and highly militant industrial army. When the proletariat consciousness of the peasants is raised, they will be able to change the world, and any miracle can be created!
    (Reported by our Guangzhou correspondent on the 13th) A mass upsurge in the study of Chairman Mao's writings is flourishing in the vast rural areas of Guangdong Province. With deep class feelings, the broad masses of peasants are eagerly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings flexibly, fundamentally transforming their world outlook in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. This is another great revolutionary movement to revolutionize the vast masses of peasants following the agricultural collectivization movement. The continuous in-depth development of this movement will transform the province's peasants into a communist-conscious, proletarianized, and revolutionized force armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The main experience of the movement is to earnestly promote the experience of the People's Liberation Army in studying Chairman Mao's writings and to apply this experience well to local areas, launching a mass movement for peasants to study Chairman Mao's writings.
    Since August last year, Guangdong Province has systematically grasped the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings. At the conference of activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings in the province, the Provincial Party Committee proposed: The study of Chairman Mao's writings should be placed at the top of all work. It was also proposed that the areas undergoing socialist education should be the key areas, and the socialist education movement should first be regarded as a revolutionary movement to flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's writings. After the meeting, an activist reporting group for studying Chairman Mao's writings was organized to give more than 200 reports in various places, with 430,000 people listening to the reports. This was a great impetus to the study of Chairman Mao's writings. Subsequently, a major debate on politics and production relations was launched among cadres at all levels in the province, proposing that all major work be grasped as political movements, that prominence be given to politics at the grassroots level, and that the focus of stationing at points be on highlighting politics, and the model should be a model of highlighting politics. These major measures have greatly enhanced the enthusiasm and consciousness of the broad masses of cadres in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings has expanded to the vast rural areas.

    When peasants meet Chairman Mao's words, they are brave to transform themselves, and their revolutionary determination is great.
    In summarizing the previous stage of the movement, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee affirmed the achievements that had been made, while also pointing out the shortcomings: the work of fundamentally transforming and educating people was not given enough prominence, the study of Chairman Mao's writings was regarded as a means to complete a task, and only Party members, League members, and a few activists were organized to study, instead of boldly launching a mass movement. Therefore, although there were achievements in the study, the effect was not very significant or very solid from a fundamental point of view. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that it is necessary to highlight the fundamental issues and grasp the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings from the transformation of world outlook. The Provincial Party Committee summarized the experience of a number of counties, communes, and brigades that have emerged across the province as good in studying. Suixi County in western Guangdong, began at the end of last year to train cadres of brigades and production teams in rotation, gathering them together to study "Serve the People", "In Memory of Norman Bethune", and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to transform their stance and viewpoints. Then, through them, they organized a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's writings in various production teams, driving more than 100,000 people in the county to participate in the study. The rural political atmosphere was unprecedentedly strong, and the farmers' production enthusiasm greatly increased. In Dongguan County in the Pearl River Delta, the county party committee and the commune party committee mainly selected some production brigades to station at points to create models, adopting a method of combining points and areas and using points to lead areas to carry out mass study movements, among which more than 20 brigades did a good job. The county party committee also trained 30,000 young people as tutors. Now, Dongguan County is also promoting Suixi's method, training grassroots cadres in batches. The experience of these two places proves that the peasant masses (including grassroots cadres) are brave to transform themselves when they meet Chairman Mao's words, and their revolutionary determination is great. The Huiyang Prefectural Committee first regarded the socialist education movement as a revolutionary movement to study Chairman Mao's writings, and always grasped the study of Chairman Mao's writings to transform grassroots cadres and arm the masses. In the entire special zone, 136 brigades did a good job, and the people's mental outlook greatly changed. Another type is to first organize and lead the militia to study, and then mobilize the masses through the militia to connect and promote cadres, so that the study movement gradually develops into a production team, a brigade, or even a commune. Such as Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County, Hengpi Commune in Enping County, etc. Originally, only four people studied in Hengpi Commune: a militia battalion commander, a militia platoon leader, a Communist Youth League branch secretary, and a blind poor peasant. They drove a production team, promoted the self-revolution of the commune party committee and the brigade branch, and through the vigorous promotion of the commune party committee, the study movement gradually expanded to the entire commune.
    These places have a common feature, that is, they focus on fundamentally improving the consciousness of the peasants and launching mass study movements. The number of people who regularly participate in the study accounts for 70-80% of the adults. These units that have studied well are all those that have earnestly practiced the experience of the People's Liberation Army in local areas. Guangdong's preliminary experience proves that the path of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory and Mao Zedong Thought is consistent. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee clearly pointed out: We must first emphasize the commonality between peasants studying Chairman Mao's writings and the army studying Chairman Mao's writings. We must honestly learn from the People's Liberation Army and do things according to the People's Liberation Army's way. We must not emphasize local characteristics. Only in this way can we lead this great revolutionary movement well.
    The peasant masses can completely highlight politics like the People's Liberation Army and become a communist-conscious, proletarianized force armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The view that there is a big difference between peasants and the army, and that this difference will exist for a long time; the view that peasants are small producers who rely on work points to eat, unlike the army that is centralized, and that Mao Zedong Thought is not easy to take root in rural areas and is not easy to be mastered by the broad masses of peasants, are all incorrect. The army is the peasants in military uniforms, and the peasants are the army without military uniforms. Highlighting politics, studying Chairman Mao's writings, and using Chairman Mao's writings to educate and transform people can be done in the army and can also be done locally. At present, there are more than 700 brigades in Guangdong Province that have done relatively well in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Although these units have not been studying Chairman Mao's writings for a long time, the mental outlook of the masses has undergone fundamental changes, and a new atmosphere has emerged in which the political atmosphere is strong, the class consciousness is high, there are many good people and good deeds, and there are few bad people and bad deeds.

    Peasants' consciousness is improved, the political atmosphere is strong, and long-standing problems are solved
    In many places, because the peasant masses have studied Chairman Mao's writings, a large number of good people and good deeds have emerged, and backward people have been transformed into advanced people batch after batch. In some production teams, there were originally some very backward people who have transformed themselves after studying Chairman Mao's writings, and they have progressed rapidly after the transformation, consciously taking Zhang Side and Norman Bethune as their models.
    When we visited Huangshandong Brigade in Boluo County, we met female commune member Ma Guanmei in the fields. She is 41 years old this year and has six children. She used to be very backward, often quarreling with others, very selfish, and did not love the collective. The cadres in the team were afraid of her. They said that they would rather go up the mountain to fight tigers than manage Ma Guanmei. Now she has undergone great changes. We worked with her in the fields and talked while working. When we asked her about her understanding of the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," she answered very well, saying that she wanted to "learn a noble, two extremes, three spirits, and be five kinds of people."
    "What is a noble?"
    "It is the style of utter devotion to others without any thought of self, which is the noblest."
    "What are the two extremes?"
    "It is what Chairman Mao said, to be extremely responsible for work and extremely enthusiastic for comrades and the people."
    "What are the three spirits?"
    "It is the spirit of communism and internationalism; the spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self; and the spirit of striving for perfection in technology and doing better and better."
    "You said you want to be five kinds of people, what are the five kinds of people?"
    "It is to be a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from vulgar tastes, and a person who is beneficial to the people."
    "How do you study 'Serve the People'?"
    "I mainly study five viewpoints, which are to correctly treat life and death, to correctly treat criticism and self-criticism, to correctly treat difficulties, to correctly treat unity and friendship, and that revolutionary work is not divided into high and low."
    "How do you treat criticism and self-criticism?"
    "Because we are serving the people, we are not afraid of others' criticism if we have shortcomings. I used to perform poorly, only caring about myself, not obeying work assignments, and specializing in quarreling with others. These are all bad ideas left over from the old society; after studying, they have all been changed."
    "How do you treat difficulties?"
    "We are all from all corners of the country, and we have come together for a common revolutionary goal. Unity is strength, and if we are not united, we cannot carry out the revolution well. In the past, I often quarreled with a neighbor, and we ignored each other for 13 years. Now I realize my mistake and have taken the initiative to apologize to her. We are all poor and lower-middle peasants, as close as sisters."
    "You have learned so well, how did you learn it?"
    "I didn't learn it well. At first, I thought that I was a person in my decades, and I was still a woman, without culture, and whether I studied or not, I still had to farm. It was useless to study. Later, the women's director tutored me and asked me to recall and compare. I thought about myself being politically oppressed and economically exploited in the past. I was sold to someone as a child bride at the age of seven, my uncles and brothers were killed by the Kuomintang bandit army, and my brother was arrested and imprisoned. In the old society, we were despicable people who even dogs looked down on. We were only liberated after liberation. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are our great saviors and great benefactors. Chairman Mao is the most brilliant, and we must read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. That's how I learned."
    "You have learned very well."
    She disagreed and said, "Comrade, Chairman Mao taught us: Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one fall behind. I want to learn until I am old and use it until I am old. The works of the old man can never be learned or used up."
    Chen Zhikui, a commune member of Xinsheng Brigade in Longgang Commune, Bao'an County, used to drink, fight, and scold people often, and would work if he wanted to, and would not work if he didn't want to. The cadres had no way to deal with him. After the Spring Festival this year, Chen Zhikui studied Chairman Mao's writings and was completely different from before. He talked about class friendship to the cadres and commune members. He said: "In the past, in the old society, many poor peasants starved to death due to disasters. I am living such a good life today. After reading Chairman Mao's books, if I don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, I will be sorry for Chairman Mao's kindness." When weeding during spring plowing, someone accidentally hit his foot with a hoe, and the wound was seven centimeters long and three centimeters deep. In the past, his method was very simple, to hit back with a hoe. Now it's different, he didn't even say a word. Others found it strange and asked him why he didn't scold him? He said, "Chairman Mao said that we should be noble and moral people! Others didn't intentionally hit your foot with a hoe. It's already injured, what's the use of scolding?" Comrades bandaged his wound and asked him to go home to rest, but he refused and continued to weed, and then carried manure to the field with the commune members. His foot injury has not yet healed, with one foot wearing shoes and the other barefoot, he rushed to do heavy work such as water conservancy. Now, whenever he talks to people about his poor performance in the past, he painfully says: "I didn't listen to Chairman Mao's words in the past and did many things that did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. In the future, I will continue to read Chairman Mao's books and constantly transform my thinking, and carry out the revolution to the end, saying it with my mouth, thinking it in my heart, and doing it with my hands."
    Many peasants talked about their study of Chairman Mao's writings, and they all talked about how backward they were before the study, how backward the production was, and how bad their attitude was, and how they improved after the study. There were 32 backward commune members in Xinsheng Brigade in the past, and now 14 of them have undergone great changes, 10 have become advanced elements, and the remaining 8 are also starting to transform.

    As a result of arming the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, the peasants' class consciousness has been improved, and the political atmosphere in the countryside has become strong. One thing leads to a hundred things, and many so-called long-standing and difficult problems that could not be solved in the past by just dealing with the matter itself and spending a lot of effort have now been solved very well. In the past, some grassroots cadres were not at ease with their work. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, they have undergone great changes after examining themselves; when cadres change, commune members also change; when cadres change, commune members also change.
    Yang Bingyou, the female deputy captain of New Team of Xinsheng Brigade, Longgang Commune, Bao'an County, has seven children. She felt that her family had a large population and wanted to earn more money. She only wanted to engage in household side occupations and was not responsible for collective affairs. The brigade leader criticized her for engaging in "small farm," and she couldn't understand it. If the team's production was not good, the commune members criticized her, and she didn't want to be a cadre. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," she remembered the eight characters "utter devotion to others without any thought of self," and examined her erroneous thoughts of putting "me" first and "selfishness" in command, and realized that she had gained the benefits of the revolution and had forgotten the foundation of the revolution. She was determined to treat the commune members and work with the spirit of "two extremes." When commune members were sick, she went to help them overcome the difficulties of seeing a doctor and buying medicine. When a female commune member gave birth to a child and did not have enough firewood at home, she took the initiative to cut grass and send it to her. When planting peanuts in early spring, a female commune member wore less clothes, and she took off her shirt and put it on her. Another female commune member was also cold, and she gave her headscarf to her. This year, when transplanting rice seedlings, she picked out sparse rice paddies and pulled them out, and gave the good rice paddies to the commune members. As a result, the commune members also competed to give good rice paddies to others to pull out, and the relationship between cadres and the masses underwent fundamental changes.
    Jialiao Brigade, Chengyue Commune, Suixi County, used to be a well-known backward brigade, and many people did not handle the relationship between public and private well. Many commune members took care of household side occupations, neglected the collective, and applied good fertilizer to their private plots, and applied bad fertilizer to the team. In this way, collective production was of course not done well, relying on state loans, grain loans, and fertilizer loans, and was a "three-dependent brigade." People said that their tails were long (capitalist tails). In the past, the superiors sent people to the brigade to do rectification work. As soon as they rectified, the tails were cut off, but they came out again afterward. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, people's thoughts changed, they broke private and established public, and everyone competed to "cut tails," wholeheartedly for the collective, and fertilizer, funds, and grain all relied on themselves, without reaching out to the state. Now everyone calls them "three-no-need brigade." Last year, they transplanted 900 mu of early rice, and this year they transplanted 1,800 mu; without fertilizer, everyone contributed, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area increased by 70% compared with last year.
    After rural educated youth studied articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," even greater changes have taken place. They understood the importance of combining with the broad masses of workers and peasants, understood the principle of farming is revolution, farming for the revolution, and strengthened their determination to revolutionize in the countryside for a lifetime. After female youth Zhong Kandi and Zhong Fuqing of Baiyin Brigade, Hengpi Commune, Enping County, graduated from school and returned to the countryside, they always wanted to go to the city to pursue "happiness" and "future," and they often absented themselves from labor. They studied Chairman Mao's books and learned that "the final demarcation between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing to and implement the combination with the workers and peasants," which caused a great shock in their thinking. They felt sorry for Chairman Mao's expectations of them and were determined to work in the countryside for a lifetime. When the weather was still cold, Zhong Fuqing took the lead in going to the pond to dig pond mud and build water conservancy. Her feet were swollen, and she thought of the spirit of the Foolish Old Man and persevered to the end. When going up the mountain to cut grass, the two of them helped the elderly and weak women carry it; they played a leading role in production labor, flood prevention and rescue, and militia training. Both of them have become production activists, and Zhong Kandi has also been elected as the Communist Youth League branch secretary. Many elderly people say that Chairman Mao's words are good. We say thousands of sentences are ineffective. He convinced these young people with just one sentence.

    Arming the peasants' minds with Mao Zedong Thought will be transformed into a huge material force. The mental outlook of the broad masses of peasants has changed, and the production outlook will naturally change greatly. The Dongguan County Party Committee has mainly focused on studying Chairman Mao's writings for the past six months, and the production problem was only arranged at the end, without using much effort, but this year's production has been better than in previous years. In previous years, Xinsheng Brigade, Longgang Commune, Bao'an County, often worked overtime at night during the busy farming season, and the efficiency was very low. This year, the early rice area was expanded by 1,500 mu, and there was no overtime work, but the rice transplanting task was completed ahead of schedule. While rice transplanting was in full swing, a nearby brigade could not complete the water conservancy task, and the commune asked them to support them. At first, the cadres felt that the task was heavy and came suddenly, and the early rice area of ​​their own brigade was also expanded, and they could not spare people. Later, the commune members held a meeting and said that Norman Bethune traveled so far to serve us, how can we not help within the same commune? They withdrew 320 people. The task of 1,800 cubic meters of earthwork was originally scheduled to be completed in seven days, but it was completed in less than two days, and it fully met the quality standards. The water conservancy headquarters was very satisfied with their work.
    Chairman Mao's books are all about the principles of revolution, and the peasants have a thorough spirit of practice, and they use what they have learned
    Why do such great changes take place when the broad masses of peasants are linked to Mao Zedong Thought? Because what Chairman Mao said is the truth, and the broad masses of peasants can easily understand the truth that Chairman Mao said through their own practice. The peasants said that what Chairman Mao said is the principle of our turning over, it is the principle of our revolution, and it goes straight to the heart when we hear it, and the more we listen to it, the sweeter it becomes. Zhong Qixi, a member of the Hengpi Brigade, Hengpi Commune, Enping County, used to think that he did not know a word, how could he read Chairman Mao's books? He didn't go when people invited him to participate in the study. Once, he quietly stood outside the door to listen. When he heard Chairman Mao talking about class analysis, talking about his own affairs, the more he listened, the more excited he became, and he went in to tell about the class oppression he had suffered. Since then, he has gone to every study session and has become an activist. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest generalization of revolutionary practice, and it is also the most vividly summarized. The peasants said: Chairman Mao's words are all the words of our masses. The principles are very high and deep, but they are simple and clear, and we can understand them as soon as we hear them. Chairman Mao has the highest prestige, and the peasants closely link their fate with Chairman Mao. They said: "Whether or not to study Chairman Mao's books is a question of forgetting the roots or not." "Chairman Mao led us to turn over and have the happy life we have today. In the future, we must build it better and realize the world revolution, so we must listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao is in Beijing, and we cannot hear Chairman Mao's words, but they are written in books, and we must read Chairman Mao's books."
    The reason why the peasant masses study Chairman Mao's writings so well is also because they have a strong revolutionary nature. Chairman Mao said, "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." This is indeed the case. First, they have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's writings. Of course, some peasants were not so conscious at the beginning, but after recalling and comparing, they would study them as eagerly as if they were thirsty or hungry. Recalling the past suffering is telling the history of turning over, telling the history of living class struggle. They were liberated from class oppression by relying on class struggle, and Chairman Mao's books are the great principles of class struggle, so their study of Chairman Mao's writings is naturally linked to their own destiny. A 56-year-old poor peasant woman in Huangshandong Brigade, Boluo County, said well: "Chairman Mao said, without poor peasants, there would be no revolution. But poor peasants can only make revolution by reading Chairman Mao's books, and they cannot make revolution without reading Chairman Mao's books. As long as I have a breath, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words even if I live to be 100 years old." Second, the peasants have a thorough spirit of practice, and they have a great determination to transform themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They use what they have learned, and they learn in order to use it. They do what Chairman Mao says. The peasants dare to expose themselves, and they immediately reveal how they thought in the past and how they planned for themselves. Some people not only talk about themselves, but also talk about how backward her husband was in the past and how she struggled with him after studying Chairman Mao's writings. In the past, many cadres emphasized that the peasants were backward and selfish. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's writings, they understand that as long as the cadres take the lead in the revolution, the masses will be even more revolutionary. Many cadres admit that they are backward and that they have not seen the extremely strong revolutionary nature of the peasants in the past.
    Launch a mass movement, grasp the basic viewpoints and study and use them repeatedly
    The common experience gained in places where the mass study movement of Chairman Mao's writings has been successful is that it is necessary to launch a mass movement. Facts have proved that men, women, old, young, advanced, and backward peasants can all study Chairman Mao's writings well. The study cannot remain in the circle of a few advanced elements for a long time. There must be backbones in the study. But it cannot always be those few people, and the broad masses should be mobilized. The two promote each other. When the masses rise, not only can the backbones be improved, but also new backbones will emerge. In many places, young people take the lead, and when old people learn, they surpass young people; cadres take the lead, and when commune members learn, they surpass cadres; men take the lead, and when women learn, they surpass men. Wave after wave is higher than the other, and the latecomers surpass the former. In the past, it was thought that it was difficult to equip instructors, but now a team generally has one or two instructors. Many instructors were originally backward elements. After they have made progress themselves, they have personal experience and can tutor others, which is much better than inviting so-called intellectuals. When instructors are organized, they are actually a political work team, a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought. Most of them are young people and are a good group of red successors. The forms and methods of launching a mass movement are the combination of training cadres in rotation from top to bottom, universally mobilizing the masses from bottom to top, cadres stationing at points, and creating models, with points and areas promoting each other. Since last autumn, Guangdong Province has trained 200,000 people, and another 800,000 to 1 million people are currently being trained.
    Another experience is to grasp the basic viewpoints and study and use them repeatedly so that the peasants' understanding is constantly deepened. The so-called basic viewpoints, first, are to establish a revolutionary world outlook, solve the fundamental stand problem, and solve the problem of how to be a person and what kind of person to be. The second is the viewpoint of class struggle, and it is necessary to educate everyone not to forget class struggle. The most fundamental thing is to always grasp the transformation of people's world outlook. When studying basic viewpoints, we must bring various living thoughts.
    Leading cadres taking the lead in learning and using is also a major experience. Dongguan, Suixi, and Hengpi Commune in Enping all emphasize the revolutionization of cadres at all levels, opening the door for rectification, stationing at points, three togethers, taking the lead in learning, and taking the lead in using. The Suixi County Party Committee leaders' transformation of their mental state is very prominent. The experience of the militia in Hengpi Commune in studying Chairman Mao's writings could not be promoted at first, because there were problems with the mental state of the commune and brigade leaders. Later, the commune party secretary examined his world outlook and made his thoughts meet the masses, took the lead in learning, and took the lead in revolution, and the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings in the entire commune quickly spread.

    推广解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验
    广东省农村中蓬勃兴起群众性学习毛主席著作热潮
    编者按：在广大农民群众中推广解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验，是提高农民的无产阶级觉悟、促进农民思想革命化的最根本的办法。
    毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”用什么教育农民，改造农民，使广大农民思想革命化？我国几十年的革命实践证明了，唯一有效的武器，就是毛泽东思想。广大农民群众对毛主席的书有最深厚的阶级感情。他们懂得，要把社会主义革命进行到底，要把我们国家建设得更强大、更美好，就一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    世界观的改造是最根本的改造。用毛泽东思想教育农民，改造他们旧的世界观，树立共产主义世界观，就一定能够把我国广大农民教育成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的产业大军。农民的无产阶级觉悟提高了，就能够改天换地，什么人间奇迹都能够创造出来！
    本报广州十三日电　一个群众性学习毛主席著作的热潮，正在广东省广大农村中蓬勃兴起。广大农民带着深厚的阶级感情，如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛泽东思想从根本上来改造自己的世界观。这是继农业集体化运动之后，使广大农民社会主义革命化的又一次伟大的革命运动。这个运动不断深入开展，将使全省农民变成一支以毛泽东思想武装的具有共产主义觉悟的、无产阶级化的、革命化的队伍。运动的主要经验，就是认真地推广人民解放军学习毛主席著作的经验，把这一经验很好地运用到地方上来，大搞农民学习毛主席著作的群众运动。
    从去年八月开始，广东省系统地抓学习毛主席著作的运动。省委在全省学习毛主席著作积极分子会议上提出：要把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。并提出以正在进行社会主义教育的地区为重点地区，把社会主义教育运动首先作为活学活用毛主席著作的革命运动。会后组织了学习毛主席著作积极分子报告团，到各地作报告二百多场，有四十三万人听了报告。这对学习毛主席著作是一个很大的推动。接着在全省各级干部中，开展了政治与生产关系的大辩论，提出把一切主要工作都作为政治运动来抓，把突出政治贯彻到基层，蹲点要蹲突出政治的点，搞样板要搞突出政治的样板。这些重大措施，大大提高了广大干部学习毛主席著作的热忱和自觉性，使学习毛主席著作的运动扩展到了广大农村中去。
    农民和毛主席的话见了面，都勇于自我改造，革命决心很大
    广东省委在总结前一段运动时，肯定了已经取得的成绩，同时也指出了缺点：对从根本观点上来改造人、教育人的工作，抓得不够突出，把学习毛主席著作看作是完成一件工作的手段，只组织党员、团员、少数积极分子学，不是放手大搞群众运动。因此，学习虽有成绩，从根本上看效果不很显著，也不很巩固。省委着重指出，要突出地抓根本问题，从世界观的改造来抓学习毛主席著作运动。省委总结了全省各地涌现出的一批学习好的县、公社和大队的经验。粤西的遂溪县，从去年底开始轮训大队、生产队干部，把他们集中起来学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》，改造立场、观点。然后通过他们在各个生产队组织群众性的学习毛主席著作运动，带动了全县十万多人参加了学习。农村政治空气空前浓厚，农民生产情绪大大高涨。珠江三角洲的东莞县，主要由县委和公社党委选择一些生产大队蹲点搞样板，采取点面结合、以点带面的方法开展群众性的学习运动，其中搞得好的有二十多个大队。县委还训练了三万青年作辅导员。现在，东莞县也在推广遂溪的办法，分批训练基层干部。这两个地方的经验都证明，农民群众（包括基层干部）同毛主席的话见了面，都勇于自我改造，革命决心很大。惠阳地委把社会主义教育运动首先作为学习毛主席著作的革命运动，始终抓住毛主席著作的学习，来改造基层干部，武装群众。全专区有一百三十六个大队搞得好，人的精神面貌大改变。再一种类型是首先组织领导好民兵的学习，然后经过民兵串连发动群众，促进干部，使学习运动逐步发展到一个生产队、大队以至公社。如博罗县的黄山洞大队、恩平县的横陂公社等。横陂公社原来只有四个人学：一个民兵营长、一个民兵排长、一个团支部书记和一个眼睛瞎了的贫农。他们带动了一个生产队，促进了公社党委和大队支部自我革命，又经过公社党委的大力推广，学习运动逐渐扩展到整个公社。
    这些地方有一个共同特点，就是着重从根本观点上去提高农民的觉悟，大搞群众性的学习运动。经常参加学习的人占成年人的百分之七、八十。这些学得好的单位，都是把人民解放军的经验运用到地方上来认真实践了的。广东的初步经验证明，工农兵掌握理论、掌握毛泽东思想的路子是一致的。因此，广东省委明确指出：必须首先强调农民学毛主席著作和军队学毛主席著作的共性，要老老实实向解放军学习，按解放军的一套来办，千万不要强调地方特殊性。只要这样办，就一定能把这一伟大的革命运动领导得好。
    农民群众完全可以象解放军那样突出政治，变成毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有共产主义觉悟的、无产阶级化的队伍。认为农民和军队差别很大，这种差别会长期存在；认为农民是小生产者，靠工分吃饭，不象军队那样集中，毛泽东思想不容易在农村扎根，不容易为广大农民所掌握等看法，都是不对的。军队是穿军衣的农民，农民是不穿军衣的军队。突出政治，学习毛主席著作，用毛主席著作来教育人改造人，在军队能做到，在地方也能做到。目前广东全省学习毛主席著作比较好的大队已有七百多个。这些单位学习毛主席著作的时间虽然还不很长，群众的精神面貌已经发生了根本的变化，出现了政治空气浓浓的、阶级觉悟高高的、好人好事多多的、坏人坏事少少的新气象。
    农民觉悟提高了，政治空气浓厚了，老大难问题解决了
    许多地方由于农民群众学了毛主席著作，好人好事大量涌现，后进者一批一批地转变为先进者。有些生产队，原来有一些很落后的人，他们学习了毛主席著作以后转变了，而且转变过来就进步很快，自觉地以张思德、白求恩作为自己的榜样。
    我们到博罗县黄山洞大队访问，在田头碰上了女社员马观妹。她今年四十一岁，有六个小孩，过去很落后，经常同人吵架，很自私，不爱集体。队里干部都怕她三分，说宁愿上山打老虎，也不愿管马观妹。现在她有了很大转变。我们同她一起劳动，一边交谈。我们问到她学习《纪念白求恩》一文的体会，她回答得非常好，说是要“学习一个高尚，两个极端，三个精神，做五种人”。
    “什么是一个高尚呀？”
    “就是毫不利己、专门利人的风格，这最高尚。”
    “什么叫两个极端呢？”
    “就是毛主席说的，对工作要极端的负责任，对同志对人民要极端的热忱。”
    “三个精神又是什么？”
    “就是共产主义和国际主义的精神；毫不利己、专门利人的精神；对技术精益求精，好上加好的精神。”
    “你说要做五种人，是指哪五种人？”
    “就是要做一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    “你是怎么样学习《为人民服务》的呢？”
    “我主要学五个观点，就是正确对待生和死，正确对待批评和自我批评，正确对待困难，正确对待团结友爱，革命工作不分贵贱这五个观点。”
    “你怎样对待批评和自我批评？”
    “因为我们是为人民服务的，所以我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评。我过去表现不好，只顾自己，不服从派工，专和别人吵架，这些都是旧社会遗留下来的坏思想；学习以后，都已经改了。”
    “你是怎样对待困难的？”
    “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。团结力量大，不团结就搞不好革命。过去我和一个邻居经常吵架，十三年来见面互不理睬，现在我认识了错误，主动向她作了检讨。我们都是贫下中农，象亲姐妹一般亲了。”
    “你学得这样好，是怎样学的呀？”
    “我学得不好。最初，我以为自己是一个几十岁的人了，还是妇女，没文化，学不学一样种田，学了也没用。后来妇女主任辅导我，让我回忆对比。我想起自己过去在政治上受压迫，经济上受剥削，七岁卖给人家当童养媳，叔伯兄弟被国民党匪军杀掉，亲兄被抓去坐牢。在旧社会，我们是连狗都瞧不起的贱人，解放了才翻了身。毛主席、共产党是我们的大救星、大恩人，毛主席最英明，我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，我就是这样学起来了。”
    “你学得很好啦。”
    她不同意地说：“同志，毛主席教给我们：虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。我要学到老，用到老，他老人家的著作是学不完，用不尽的。”
    宝安县龙岗公社新生大队有一个社员叫陈志奎，以前常喝酒、打架、骂人，愿意做工就做，不愿意做就不做，干部对他毫无办法。今年春节后，陈志奎学习了毛主席著作，前后判若两人，对干部对社员大讲阶级友爱。他说：“过去旧社会闹灾荒，多少贫农饿死了。我今天日子过得这样好，读了毛主席的书，不听毛主席的话，对不起毛主席的恩情。”春耕除草的时候，别人一锄头锄了他的脚，伤口有七分长三分深。要是在过去，他的办法很简单，一锄头打回去再说。现在不同了，他竟然没吭气。别人觉得奇怪，问他为什么不骂两句？他说：“毛主席说，要做一个高尚的人，有道德的人嘛！人家又不是有意锄伤你的脚，已经伤了，骂有什么用？”同志们给他包扎好伤口，叫他回家休息，他不肯，继续锄完了草，又和社员一起担粪下田。他脚伤还没有好，一脚穿鞋，一脚光着，就抢着去干水利等重活。现在每当和人讲起自己以前表现不好，他就痛心地说：“我过去没听毛主席的话，做了许多不符合毛主席教导的事，今后我要不断读毛主席的书，不断改造思想，革命到底，口这样讲，心这样想，手这样做。”
    许多农民讲起学习毛主席著作的情况，都讲到学习前自己怎么落后，生产怎么落后，态度怎么不好，学习以后又是怎样改进的。新生大队过去落后的社员有三十二人，现在有十四人已经有了很大的转变，十人成了先进分子，其余八人也在开始转变。
    用毛泽东思想武装农民的结果，农民的阶级觉悟提高了，农村的政治空气浓厚了。一通百通，过去就事论事，费力很大还解决不了的许多所谓老大难问题，现在都很好解决了。过去有些基层干部不安心工作，学习毛主席著作以后，对照检查自己，已经有了很大转变；干部一改，社员也改；干部一变，社员也变。
    宝安县龙岗公社新生大队新一队女副队长杨炳友，有七个孩子，她觉得自家人口多，想多收入点钱，净想搞家庭副业，对集体的事不负责任。大队长批评她是搞“小农场”，她想不通。队里生产搞不好，社员批评她，她就不想当干部。经过学习《纪念白求恩》，她记住了“毫不利己专门利人”八个字，检查了自己的我字当头、私字挂帅的错误思想，认识到自己得了革命的好处，忘了革命的本。她决心用“两个极端”的精神对待社员、对待工作。社员有病，她去帮他们克服请医买药的困难。一个女社员生孩子，家里烧柴不够，她主动割草送去。初春种花生，一个女社员衣服穿得少，她脱下自己的衫给她披上。另一个女社员也冷，她又将自己包头的毛巾让给人家。今年插秧，自己拣疏秧田拔，把好秧让给社员。这样一来，社员也争着让好秧田给旁人拔，干群关系起了根本的变化。
    遂溪县城月公社家寮大队，原来是个有名的落后大队，许多人对公私关系处理不好。有不少社员顾家庭副业，不顾集体，好肥往自留地上，不好的才向队里投。这样，集体生产当然搞不好，依赖国家贷款、贷粮、贷化肥，是个“三依赖大队”。人们说他们尾巴长（资本主义尾巴）。过去上级派人到这个大队做整顿工作，刚一整，尾巴断了，可是过后又出来了。经过学习毛主席著作，人们思想变了，破私立公，大家争着“割尾巴”，一心为集体，肥料、资金、粮食全靠自己，不向国家伸手，现在大家叫他们“三不要大队”。去年早造插秧九百亩，今年插了一千八百亩；没有肥料大家投，单位面积施肥量比去年增加了百分之七十。
    农村知识青年学习了《纪念白求恩》《青年运动的方向》等文章后，发生了更大的变化。他们懂得了和广大工农群众结合的重要性，懂得了种田是革命、为革命种田的道理，坚定了在农村革命一辈子的决心。恩平县横陂公社白银大队女青年钟恳娣、钟芙清，从学校毕业回农村后，总想到城里去追求“幸福”和“前途”，劳动常缺勤。她们学毛主席的书，学到“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”，在思想上引起很大震动，感到对不起毛主席对自己的期望，下定决心在农村干一辈子。钟芙清在天还冷时，带头下塘挖塘泥，修水利。脚磨肿了，她想起愚公精神，坚持到底。上山割草，她俩帮着年老体弱的妇女挑；在生产劳动、防洪抢险、民兵训练中，处处起带头作用。两个人都成了生产积极分子，钟恳娣还被选为团分支书记。许多老年人说，毛主席的话就是好，我们讲千句万句都不灵，他老人家讲一句，就把这些年青人说服了。
    用毛泽东思想把农民的思想武装起来，就会转化为巨大的物质力量。广大农民的精神面貌变化了，生产面貌自然会大大变化。东莞县委半年来主要是抓学习毛主席著作，生产问题只是最后安排一下，没有用很大力气，但今年的生产却搞得比往年好。宝安县龙岗公社新生大队，往年农忙的时候，常开夜工，工效很低。今年早造扩大一千五百亩，没有开夜工，插秧却提前完成了任务。正在插秧大忙的时候，附近一个大队水利任务完不成，公社要求他们去支援。开始，干部觉得任务重，来得突然，本队的早造面积又扩大了，抽不出人来。以后社员开会，都说白求恩那么远跑到我们这里来服务，我们同一个公社，怎么能够不帮忙？他们抽去了三百二十人。一千八百土方的任务，原订七天完成，结果不到两天就完成了，完全合乎质量标准。水利指挥部对他们的工作满意极了。
    毛主席的书都是讲革命的道理，农民有彻底实践精神，学了就用
    为什么广大农民一和毛泽东思想挂起钩来，就会发生这样大的变化呢？因为毛主席讲的是真理，广大农民通过自己的实践，很容易懂得毛主席讲的真理。农民说，毛主席讲的，是我们翻身的道理，是我们革命的道理，一听就入心，越听越甜。恩平县横陂公社横陂大队社员钟启喜，过去认为自己一个字不识，怎么能读毛主席的书？人家邀他参加学习，他不去。有一次他悄悄站在门外边听，听到毛主席讲阶级分析的话，讲的是自己的事情，越听越心动，就进去诉起了自己所受的阶级压迫苦。此后，每次学习他都去，变成了积极分子。毛泽东思想是革命实践最高的概括，也概括得最活。农民说：毛主席的话都是我们群众的话，讲的道理很高很深，可是简单明了，一听就懂。毛主席有最高的威信，农民把自己的命运同毛主席紧紧连在一起。他们讲：“学不学毛主席的书是忘本不忘本的问题”，“毛主席领导我们翻了身，才有今天的幸福生活。今后还要建设得更好，还要实现世界革命，就要听毛主席的话。毛主席在北京，毛主席讲话我们听不到，可是写在书上了，我们就要读毛主席的书。”
    农民群众学毛主席著作所以学得好，还在于他们有强烈的革命性。毛主席说，“没有贫农，便没有革命”，确实如此。第一，他们对毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情。当然，有些农民在开始也不是那么自觉的，但是经过回忆对比，就会如饥如渴地学习起来。回忆诉苦，就是讲翻身史，讲活的阶级斗争史。他们是靠了阶级斗争才从阶级压迫中解放出来的，毛主席的书是阶级斗争的大道理，所以他们学毛主席著作很自然地和自己的命运联系起来。博罗县黄山洞大队一个五十六岁的贫农妇女说得好：“毛主席说，没有贫农，便没有革命。可是贫农读毛主席的书才能革命，不读毛主席的书就不能革命。我只要有一口气，活到一百岁也要听毛主席的话。”第二，农民有彻底的实践精神，对于用毛泽东思想改造自己的决心很大，学了就用，学就是为了用。毛主席怎么说的，他们就怎么做。农民敢于自我暴露，过去怎么想，怎么为个人打算，内心世界一下就摊出来了。有的人不仅讲自己，还讲她丈夫原来怎么落后，自己学了毛主席著作怎么同他作斗争。过去，许多干部强调农民落后自私，现在一学毛主席著作，懂得了只要干部带头革命，群众更加革命。许多干部承认：是自己落后了，过去没有看到农民的极其强烈的革命性。
    大搞群众运动，抓住基本观点反复学反复用
    群众性学习毛主席著作学得好的地方，所取得的共同经验，头一条就是一定要大搞群众运动。事实证明，农民中男、女、老、少，先进的，落后的，人人都可以学好毛主席著作。学习不能长期停留在少数先进分子的圈子里。学习要有骨干。但是不能老是那几个人，应当发动广大群众。这两者是相互促进的，群众起来了，不仅骨干可以提高，还会涌现新的骨干。很多地方是青年带头，老年人学了，又超过青年；干部带头，社员学了，又超过干部；男人带头，妇女学了，又超过男人。一浪高一浪，后来者居上。过去认为辅导员不好配备，现在一个队一般地都有一两个辅导员。很多辅导员原来是落后分子，自己进步了，就有了切身的体会，就能辅导别人，比请来的所谓知识分子好得多。辅导员组织起来了，实际上就是一个政治工作队，就是毛泽东思想的宣传队。他们大多数是青年，是一批很好的红色接班人。大搞群众运动的形式和方法，就是自上而下地轮训干部，同自下而上地普遍发动群众、干部蹲点、搞样板相结合，点面互相推动。广东全省去秋以来已经集训二十万人，正在集训中的还有八十万到一百万人。
    再一条经验是抓住基本观点反复学反复用，使农民的认识不断加深。所谓基本观点，第一是要确立革命的世界观，解决根本立场问题，解决如何作人、作什么样的人的问题。第二是阶级斗争观点，要教育大家千万不要忘记阶级斗争。最根本的是要始终抓住人的世界观的改造。学习基本观点时，都要带上各种活思想。
    领导带头学带头用也是一条主要的经验。东莞、遂溪和恩平横陂公社，都强调各级干部革命化，开门整风，蹲点，三同，带头学，带头用。遂溪县委领导改造自己的精神状态就很突出。横陂公社民兵学习毛主席著作的经验最初推广不开，就是因为公社、大队领导干部的精神状态有问题，后来公社党委书记检查了自己的世界观，并且使自己的思想同群众见了面，带头学，带头革命，全公社学习毛主席著作的运动很快就推开了。
