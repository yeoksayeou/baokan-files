    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th of June -- Workers, peasants, and soldiers in Yan'an held a concert to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." At the meeting, they, with the militant posture of the socialist cultural revolution, sang praises to the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating the powerful prestige of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in resolutely defending Mao Zedong Thought and actively participating in the socialist cultural revolution.
    The concert opened with "The East is Red." Dozens of commune members wearing sheepskin headscarves sang in unison with magnificent and heroic voices: "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong, he seeks happiness for the people, hark, he is the great savior of the people." These members came from the Qiao'ergou Brigade of the Chengguan Commune. Since 1943, after learning to sing the song "The East is Red" from the neighboring Lu Xun Academy of Arts, they have sung it extensively and continuously to this day. The lyrics of this folk song were written by an old poor peasant from northern Shaanxi in the winter of 1942 under the guidance of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The song truthfully expresses the boundless love of the broad working people for the Party and Chairman Mao. Now, it has become one of the most beloved revolutionary songs of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world.
    Every program performed at this meeting was filled with deep class feelings, warmly praising the great Mao Zedong Thought. The female vocal performance "Skillfully Embroidering Yan'an" performed by the Yan'an Handicraft Cooperative expressed the sincere love of Yan'an workers for Chairman Mao with heartfelt songs. The song "The Yan River is Clear Under the Pagoda Mountain" sung by the members of the Liulin Brigade of the Liulin Commune depicted the great victory they had won in changing the world under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The chorus "Ten Sings of Qiao'ergou" by the members of the Qiao'ergou Brigade of the Chengguan Commune also expressed the desire of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to follow Chairman Mao forever. The audience present repeatedly requested encores of these programs with warm applause.
    The public security fighters of Yan'an, with the fighting enthusiasm to resolutely eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line on the cultural front, performed songs such as the chorus "Launch a High Tide of the Great Cultural Revolution." Folk artist Han Qixiang also, with full revolutionary passion, sang and told a Shaanxi storytelling song that he had rushed to compile: "My sanxian is a machine gun, the storytelling song is a bullet, I use the sanxian and storytelling song to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought."
    Most of the revolutionary songs performed in this concert were self-composed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Yan'an County. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and breaking down the "authority" of the bourgeoisie, they have self-composed and self-performed more than two hundred programs in the past two years. These programs are all portrayals of the fiery struggle life of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Workers, peasants, and soldiers sing about themselves, perform about themselves, with profound class feelings and strong fighting spirit, effectively resisting the decadent music spread by bourgeois "authorities" and giving great encouragement to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十四周年
    延安工农兵热情歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想
    新华社西安四日电　延安工农兵青年举行演唱会，纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十四周年。会上，他们以社会主义文化大革命的战斗姿态，高歌颂扬当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想，显示了广大工农兵坚决保卫毛泽东思想、积极参加社会主义文化大革命的强大声威。
    演唱会以《东方红》为序幕。几十名头扎羊肚手巾的公社社员，以雄壮豪迈的歌声，齐唱：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东，他为人民谋幸福，呼儿咳哟，他是人民大救星。”这些社员来自城关公社桥儿沟大队。自从一九四三年，他们从邻居鲁迅艺术学院那里学会演唱《东方红》这首歌以后，便大唱特唱，一直唱到现在。这首民歌的歌词是陕北一位老贫农，在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的指引下，在一九四二年冬天编出来的。歌曲如实地表达了广大劳动人民对党和毛主席无比的热爱。现在，它已成为全国、全世界革命人民最爱唱的革命歌曲之一。
    在这次会上演唱的每一个节目，都充满深厚的阶级感情，热烈歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。延安手工业工艺社演出的女声表演唱《巧绣延安》，以真挚的歌声表达了延安工人对毛主席的衷心爱戴。柳林公社柳林大队社员演唱的《宝塔山下延水清》，描绘了他们在毛泽东思想的哺育下，夺得了改天换地的伟大胜利。城关公社桥儿沟大队社员的大合唱：《十唱桥儿沟》，也表达了广大工农兵群众要永远跟着毛主席的心愿。在场的听众以热烈的掌声一再要求重演这些节目。
    延安的公安战士带着坚决搞掉文化战线上的反党反社会主义黑线的战斗热情，演出了大合唱《掀起文化大革命高潮》等歌曲。民间艺人韩起祥也怀着满腔的革命激情，说唱了赶编出来的一个陕北书词：“我的三弦是机关枪，书词是子弹，我用三弦和书词，来捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。”
    这次演唱的革命歌曲大多数是延安县工农兵群众自编的。他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，破除资产阶级的“权威”，近两年就自编自演了二百多个节目。这些节目都是工农兵火热的斗争生活的写照。工农兵唱自己，演自己，阶级感情深厚，战斗气息强烈，有力地抵制了资产阶级“权威”散布的靡靡之音，给予工农兵群众以极大的鼓舞。
