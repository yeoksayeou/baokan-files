The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Cha Huaduo, held a reception tonight to warmly welcome the representatives and observers from various countries and regions attending the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference.

Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo, Lin Feng, and other guests were invited to attend the reception.

Cha Huaduo spoke at the reception, extending warm and fraternal greetings on behalf of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association to the writers' representatives from various countries and regions. He said that so many revolutionary writers from Asian and African countries and regions have come to the capital of the great Chinese people to exchange views and situations and to discuss major issues. This will certainly further strengthen and accelerate our struggle against our common enemy—the imperialism led by the United States.

Cha Huaduo sincerely hopes that the revolutionary writers and journalists of Asia and Africa will do more work on the cultural and journalistic fronts to expose the ugly faces of imperialists, fascists, reactionaries, and pseudo-revolutionaries, and to mobilize the masses to strengthen the anti-imperialist front.

Cha Huaduo said that he holds the utmost respect for the very important speech delivered by Vice-Premier Chen Yi at the opening ceremony of the Asian-African Writers' Emergency Conference. He also agrees with the report to the conference by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian-African Writers and the speeches of many representatives. Cha Huaduo expressed his belief that this emergency conference will surely achieve great success.

Mrs. Nancy Grant from Sierra Leone, representing the Permanent Bureau of Asian-African Writers, expressed her thanks to the hosts of the reception. She said that the sacred task of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and the Asian-African Writers' Conference is first and foremost to oppose imperialism, especially American imperialism and its evil deeds in Vietnam. At the same time, we must educate the masses of the people, expose imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the reactionaries of various countries. We must also oppose the false information spread by the newspapers and radio stations of imperialism.

She concluded by saying, "Let the journalists and writers of Asia and Africa advance with pens, ink, and typewriters to destroy all imperialism and reactionaries, they are wolves that eat people." She shouted, "Advance! Never retreat!"

Guests invited to tonight's reception also included Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Zairou, Chu Tunan, and other responsible officials from relevant departments. Some foreign friends and journalists in Beijing were also invited to the reception. (With a picture)

    新华社二十八日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多今天晚上举行招待会，热烈欢迎出席亚非作家紧急会议的各国各地区代表和观察员。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、林枫等，应邀出席了招待会。
    查禾多在招待会上讲话，他代表亚非新闻工作者协会书记处向各国各地区作家代表致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。他说，这么多亚非国家和地区的战斗作家，来到伟大中国人民的首都，交换意见和情况，共商大计，这必将进一步加强和加速我们反对共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争。
    查禾多热忱希望亚非的革命作家和新闻工作者，在文化和新闻战线上做更多的工作，来揭露帝国主义、法西斯主义分子、反动派、假革命者的丑恶面目，并动员群众加强反帝战线。
    查禾多说，我对中国国务院副总理陈毅在亚非作家紧急会议开幕式上发表的十分重要的讲话，表示最崇高的敬意。对亚非作家常设局秘书长向会议的报告以及许多代表的发言表示赞同。查禾多表示相信，这次紧急会议必将取得巨大成功。
    塞拉勒窝内的南西·格兰特夫人代表亚非作家常设局对招待会的主人表示感谢。她说，亚非新闻工作者协会和亚非作家会议的神圣的任务首先是反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义和它正在越南进行的罪恶勾当。同时，我们必须教育人民群众，揭露帝国主义、新老殖民主义和各国反动派。我们还必须反对帝国主义的报纸、电台所传播的错误消息。
    她最后说，让亚非新闻工作者和作家拿着笔、墨水、打字机前进，消灭一切帝国主义和反动派，他们是吃人的豺狼。她高呼：前进吧！决不后退！
    应邀出席今晚招待会的，还有廖承志、张奚若、楚图南等有关方面的负责人。一些在北京的外国朋友和新闻工作者，也应邀出席了招待会。（附图片）
