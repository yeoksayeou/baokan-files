In various battles in May, they annihilated more than 1,240 enemy troops, including over 1,100 American aggressor troops, completely wiping out one company and one platoon of U.S. troops, shooting down 11 enemy aircraft, damaging multiple others, and destroying and damaging 13 enemy amphibious armored vehicles, tanks, and 15 other types of military vehicles.
    Local troops and guerrillas in various locations are closely coordinating, frequently attacking the enemy on transportation lines. In the first five days of May alone, guerrillas in four townships, including Dien Quang in Dien Ban County, annihilated nearly 60 American aggressor troops, damaged 10 enemy military vehicles, and captured two American aggressors alive. Local troops and guerrillas in Dai Loc County, from May 3rd to 12th, annihilated more than 350 American aggressor troops, completely wiping out one U.S. company, destroying eight enemy tanks, shooting down five enemy helicopters, and seizing a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.

Wherever the American bandits went, they cruelly implemented a policy of burn all, destroy all, kill all, and dispatched aircraft day and night to bomb and strafe, even using chemical poisons and toxic gases to slaughter the local people.

    南越军民雨季作战十分活跃捷报频传
    广南和西宁军民五月份歼灭美军两千余毁伤敌机数十架
    土龙木省军民在十三号公路上七战七捷歼灭美军三百人
　  据新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省北部军民，到处打击敌人，打得很出色。在五月份的各次战斗中，共歼敌一千二百四十多名，其中包括美国侵略军一千一百多名，全歼美军一个连和一个排，击落敌机十一架，击伤多架，击毁和击伤敌两栖装甲车、坦克十三辆以及其它类型军车十五辆。
    各地地方部队和游击队密切配合，频频在交通线上袭击敌人。在五月份的头五天中，仅奠盘县的奠光等四个乡的游击队，就歼灭美国侵略军近六十名，击伤敌人军车十辆，同时活捉了两个美国侵略者。大禄县地方部队和游击队，五月三日到十二日，共歼灭美国侵略军三百五十多名，全歼美军一个连，击毁敌坦克八辆，击落敌直升飞机五架，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
  据新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西宁省军民在五月份内，共打死、打伤敌人一千一百零七名，其中有美国侵略军和帮凶军九百四十七名；瓦解敌军一百十七名；击毁、击伤敌两栖装甲车和重型坦克九十八辆；击落和击伤敌各种类型飞机三十五架。
    在这期间，美国强盗为了挽救旱季的惨重失败，出动成万名美军、帮凶军和伪军，到西宁省周城、杨明珠、鹅油下、盏盆等县的解放区进行了四次大规模的“扫荡”。美国强盗所到之处，残酷推行烧光、毁光、杀光政策，并且日夜出动飞机进行轰炸、扫射，甚至使用化学毒药和毒气屠杀当地人民。
    据新华社河内十八日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方土龙木省解放军和游击队在六月四日到十三日的十天中，接连在第十三号公路上进行了七次漂亮的袭击战，共歼灭敌人五百名，其中包括美国侵略军三百人。（附图片）
