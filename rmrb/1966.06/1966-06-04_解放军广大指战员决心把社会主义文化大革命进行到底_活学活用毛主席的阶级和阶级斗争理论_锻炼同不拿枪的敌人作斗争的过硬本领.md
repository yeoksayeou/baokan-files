The broad masses of the People's Liberation Army are determined to carry the socialist cultural revolution to the end. They actively study and apply Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, and temper themselves to fight against enemies who do not bear arms.

	New China News Agency, June 2nd. In the current socialist cultural revolution, many units of the People's Liberation Army have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, tempering themselves to fight against enemies who do not bear arms. They unanimously believe that this is the most important task in emphasizing politics at present. Only by studying Chairman Mao's works in the midst of class struggle and applying them in class struggle, can every revolutionary soldier study faster, understand deeper, and apply more flexibly, thereby achieving their own ideological transformation and thoroughly defeating the enemy's subversive plots.

	In this cultural revolution struggle, many units first organized the soldiers and officers to seriously study Chairman Mao's expositions on the laws of class struggle in socialist society, extensively discussing the situation of class struggle, learning while discussing, and treating the cultural revolution as a large classroom for conducting class struggle education. Some units organized soldiers and officers to study and apply several basic viewpoints from Chairman Mao's theories on class struggle to analyze the new situation and new characteristics of class struggle at present, thus gaining a clearer understanding of this small group of anti-party and anti-socialist elements. They clearly recognize that these elements are actively preparing public opinion to attempt the restoration of capitalism, and we must resolutely counterattack them. They say that if we relax our vigilance in the ideological realm, our country will be in danger of changing color.

	Through study, the broad masses of soldiers and officers treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive for action, observing various issues in the cultural revolution, and thus standing higher and seeing deeper. Many soldiers and officers, with boundless loyalty to the Party and the people and deep hatred for class enemies, held lectures, discussions, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and wrote articles, using various forms to study Chairman Mao's works while criticizing and refuting "black articles" and "black words." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit formed small combat groups of three or five, studying Chairman Mao's relevant works and quotations repeatedly, and reading through many "black articles" from "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Notes" repeatedly. Using Chairman Mao's works as weapons, they studied the enemy situation, found "targets," and immediately identified over twenty "targets." Then, taking the enemy situation to consult Chairman Mao's works, they immediately tore apart the disguise of the Deng Tuo clique, exposing the reactionary face of the clique's plot to overthrow the Party's leadership and subvert the socialist system. The soldiers and officers of the Fourth Company of a certain unit wrote dozens of articles criticizing and refuting the Deng Tuo clique within a few days. Subsequently, they held a study session on Chairman Mao's works, further using Chairman Mao's expositions on class and class struggle to systematically criticize and refute the reactionary fallacies of the Deng Tuo clique against the dictatorship of the proletariat. Everyone unanimously agreed that we must not underestimate this group of enemies who do not bear arms. We must fight them with guns against guns, pens against pens, and resolutely carry this life-and-death class struggle to the end.

	The soldiers and officers, having grasped Mao Zedong Thought, are like having obtained a "mirror to see through demons" in politics, and everyone has "golden eyes." The soldiers of the Cultural Revolution Combat Group of the Guard Battalion of a certain unit in Guangzhou laid out the reactionary articles written by Deng Tuo, such as "One Third of Life," and used Chairman Mao's words to analyze and criticize them, further seeing through the evil plot of the Deng Tuo clique to restore capitalism using the method of "peaceful evolution." They said that this group of class enemies who do not bear arms uses soft knives to kill people. These enemies who raise the "red flag" to oppose the red flag are more vicious, more cunning, and more dangerous than those who bear arms. If we believe their "black words" and "cherish this one third of life," we will walk the dangerous path of detaching from politics and the combat collective, and we will "peacefully evolve" and fall into the mire of the bourgeoisie. The platoon leader Cao Huicheng and squad leader Zhang Daolu of a certain unit in Shenyang wrote in an article that although there are no gunshots or cannon fire here, it is a life-and-death class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Many soldiers and officers believe that as proletarian revolutionary soldiers, we must always emphasize politics and achieve ideological transformation to be the hard bones of the proletariat in the political and ideological front against "sugar-coated shells."

	Many soldiers and officers, while using Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the counter-revolutionary plots of the "Three-Family Village" clique, paid special attention to firmly refuting the vicious attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat in articles like "The Way of the King and the Way of the Tyrant" written by Deng Tuo. The Five Good Soldier Fang Qingzhao of a certain unit wrote in the article "The Revolutionary 'Way of the Tyrant' is Very Good" that we revolutionary people are very clear that in the dark old China, the Kuomintang reactionaries relied on their power to carry out bloody suppression of the proletariat and laboring people. They would rather kill a thousand innocents than let one communist go. The bloody facts tell us: all reactionaries in history, all class enemies at home and abroad, have used the counter-revolutionary "way of the tyrant." Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Against the reactionary acts of the reactionaries and reactionary classes, we must not practice benevolent rule." We must use the methods of imperialism and reactionaries at home and abroad to counterattack imperialism and reactionaries at home and abroad, practicing the revolutionary "way of the tyrant" on them, allowing them to behave properly and not let them talk or act recklessly. The Five Good Soldier Li Qinghai of a certain unit said that in the old society, the landlord tyrants, this pack of wolves, rode on the heads of the people, acting arrogantly and tyrannically. What "way of the king" and "way of the tyrant," all are "black ways." In short, they want us to give up the dictatorship of the proletariat and coexist peacefully with ghosts and monsters, let them say everything, and then let them snatch the power from our hands, take the stage, and rule over us. Then, ten thousand revolutionary people will have their heads chopped off. The air force soldier Wang Wei said, we must rely on the mighty power of the proletarian dictatorship to practice the "way of the tyrant" on the enemy. If we practice "benevolent rule" and "benevolence" on ghosts and monsters, it is a betrayal of the revolution and a cruelty to the people. Through the criticism of this poisonous weed, the soldiers and officers deeply felt that they must keep a close eye on the enemies who bear arms, be ready at any time to defeat the armed attacks of American imperialism and its running dogs, and at the same time, be highly vigilant against the enemies who do not bear arms, and resolutely smash the evil plots of the bourgeoisie against the Party and socialism.

	In the struggle to criticize the Deng Tuo clique, the broad masses of soldiers and officers deeply felt that the current battlefield of class struggle is the best classroom for actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The student Shu Kepeng of the political school of a certain unit said, Chairman Mao's many expositions, although studied before, were not understood deeply enough and applied flexibly enough; through active study and application in this struggle, Chairman Mao's many viewpoints have taken root in the mind. Many soldiers and officers believe that Chairman Mao's works are a treasure trove of proletarian revolutionary theory. Here, there are weapons to fight against enemies who bear arms, and there are weapons to fight against enemies who do not bear arms. As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this sharpest weapon, we can not only dare to fight to the death in real battles, but also charge and fight in the ideological and cultural front. The deeper the socialist revolution goes, the more hidden and cunning the class enemies become, and we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that our socialist homeland will never change color.

    解放军广大指战员决心把社会主义文化大革命进行到底
    活学活用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争理论
    锻炼同不拿枪的敌人作斗争的过硬本领
    新华社二日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队指战员在当前社会主义文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争理论，锻炼同不拿枪的敌人作斗争的过硬本领。他们一致认为，这是当前突出政治的头等重要大事。每一个革命战士，只有把毛主席著作放在阶级斗争中学，在阶级斗争中用，才能比平时学得更快，领会得更深，用得更活，从而实现自己的思想革命化，彻底打垮敌人的颠覆阴谋。
    在这场文化大革命斗争中，许多部队首先组织指战员认真学习了毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级斗争规律的论述，大摆阶级斗争的形势，边学边议，把文化大革命当作进行阶级斗争教育的大课堂。有些部队，组织指战员学习和运用毛主席关于阶级斗争理论中的几个基本观点，来分析当前阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，对不拿枪的敌人认识得更清楚了，更加明确了这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，对党和社会主义的猖狂进攻，是妄图为实现复辟资本主义积极作舆论准备，我们必须给以坚决的反击。他们说，对意识形态领域内的阶级斗争放松警惕，我们的国家就有改变颜色的危险。
    通过学习，广大指战员把毛主席的书当作行动的最高指示，观察文化大革命中的各个问题，因而，站得更高，看得更深。许多部队指战员，怀着对党、对人民的无限忠诚，对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，纷纷举行讲用会、座谈会，出墙报、黑板报、写文章，运用多种形式，一边学习毛主席著作，一边针对“黑文”、“黑话”进行批判驳斥。某部指战员三个一群，五个一组，结成战斗小组，把毛主席的有关著作和语录学了一次又一次，把《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》的许多“黑文”看了一遍又一遍，以毛主席著作为武器，研究敌情、找“靶子”，一下就摆出了二十多个“靶子”，然后又反过来带着敌情请教毛主席著作，立刻撕碎了邓拓黑帮的伪装，揭穿了黑帮阴谋推翻党的领导、颠覆社会主义制度的反动面目。某部四连指战员几天内就写出了四五十篇批判驳斥邓拓黑帮的文章，接着他们又举行了学习毛主席著作讲用会，进一步用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，系统批判驳斥邓拓黑帮反对无产阶级专政的反动谬论。大家一致认为，决不能轻视这伙不拿枪的敌人，我们要枪对枪，笔对笔，坚决把这场你死我活的阶级斗争进行到底。
    指战员们掌握了毛泽东思想，就象政治上获得了“照妖镜”，人人长了“火眼金睛”。广州部队某部警卫营文化革命战斗小组的战士们，把邓拓写的《生命的三分之一》等反动文章摆出来，用毛主席的话加以分析批判，进一步看清了邓拓黑帮用“和平演变”的方法搞资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋。他们说，邓拓这一伙不拿枪的阶级敌人是用软刀子杀人，这些打着“红旗”反红旗的敌人，比拿枪的敌人更毒辣、更狡猾、更危险。如果听信他们的“黑话”那样去“珍惜这三分之一的生命”，我们就会走上脱离政治，脱离战斗集体的危险道路，就会使自己“和平演变”，陷入资产阶级的泥坑。沈阳部队某部指导员曹惠臣和班长张道路在一篇文章中写道，这里虽然没有枪声、炮声，但是，却是无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁的一场你死我活的阶级斗争。许多指战员认为，作为无产阶级革命战士，任何时候都要突出政治，实现思想革命化，才能在反对“糖衣炮弹”的政治思想战线上做无产阶级的硬骨头。
    许多部队指战员在运用毛泽东思想批判“三家村”黑帮的反革命阴谋活动时，特别注意对邓拓写的《王道和霸道》等恶毒攻击无产阶级专政的“黑话”，予以坚决批驳。某部五好战士方庆昭在《革命的“霸道”好得很》文章中说，我们革命的人民很清楚，在黑暗的旧中国，国民党反动派是怎样依靠他们的权势，对无产阶级和劳动人民进行血腥的镇压。他们宁肯错杀一千，决不放过一个共产党人。血淋淋的事实告诉我们：历史上的一切反动派，国内外所有的阶级敌人都是采用反革命的“霸道”的。毛主席早就教导我们：“对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。”我们要以帝国主义和国内外反动派之道，还治帝国主义和国内外反动派之身，对他们实行革命的“霸道”，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。某部五好战士李庆海说，旧社会地主老财这群豺狼骑在人民头上，作威作福，什么“王道”、“霸道”，全是“黑道”。说穿了就是要我们放弃无产阶级专政，和牛鬼蛇神和平共处，一切由他们说了算，再让他们从我们手里夺去印把子，上台专我们的政，那千万革命人民就要人头落地。空军战士王伟说，我们就是要依靠无产阶级专政的强大威力，对敌人实行“霸道”，假如对牛鬼蛇神施行“王道”和“仁政”，就是对革命的背叛，对人民的残忍。通过对这株毒草的批判，指战员们更加体会到，一定要密切注视拿枪的敌人，随时准备打败美帝国主义及其走狗的武装进攻，同时还要高度警惕不拿枪的敌人，坚决粉碎资产阶级反党反社会主义的罪恶阴谋。
    在批判邓拓黑帮的斗争中，广大指战员深深感到当前阶级斗争的战场，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的课堂。某部政治学校学员舒克鹏说，毛主席的许多论述，过去也学过，总是领会不够深，用得不够活；通过在这次斗争中活学活用，毛主席的许多观点就在脑子里扎下了根。许多指战员认为，毛主席著作是无产阶级革命理论的宝库。这里面既有同拿枪的敌人作斗争的武器，也有同不拿枪的敌人作斗争的武器，只要掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，我们不仅能够在真刀真枪的战场上敢于刺刀见红，而且能够在思想文化战线上冲锋陷阵。社会主义革命越深入，阶级敌人越隐蔽，越狡猾，我们越要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，保证我们社会主义江山永不变色。
