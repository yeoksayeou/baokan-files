    (Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd) As the American aggressors continue to suffer disastrous defeats on the South Vietnamese battlefield, the internal strife within the South Vietnamese puppet clique and the contradictions between the United States and its running dogs are intensifying. At the same time, a revolutionary storm launched by the broad masses of people in the US-puppet controlled areas against US imperialism and its running dogs is surging, powerfully impacting the crumbling US-puppet rule.

    Since the beginning of March, the contradictions between the Nguyen Cao Ky-Nguyen Van Thieu group, fostered by the United States, and the Nguyen Chanh Thi group in the central region have developed from covert infighting into open conflict. Other factions excluded by Nguyen Cao Ky also seized the opportunity to compete for power, forming a chaotic scene of dogs fighting over food. Under the direction and pressure of the United States, the Nguyen Cao Ky group staged a farce of convening a "National Political Representative Congress," playing the trick of holding "general elections" and establishing a "civilian government" to appease various opposition factions and prolong its dictatorial rule. However, this deceptive trick was resisted by the Nguyen Chanh Thi group and other opposition factions. On May 15th, Nguyen Cao Ky suddenly sent troops to Da Nang to carry out armed suppression, and the two groups engaged in a real gun battle in Da Nang. The gun battle lasted for eight days. With the help of its American masters, Nguyen Cao Ky finally temporarily controlled Da Nang. Although the two groups are currently brewing a so-called "reconciliation" under the manipulation of the United States, they are still deadlocked with each other. Therefore, even Western news agencies say that the sharp contradictions between the two groups "are still far from resolved" and a new "more serious political crisis" may occur.

    While the puppet clique was engaged in dogfights and chaos, the people in the cities of the South Vietnamese US-puppet controlled areas took advantage of this favorable opportunity to launch a powerful revolutionary struggle storm against the entire rule of the US-puppet, giving the US-puppet group a heavy blow. Since mid-March, large-scale demonstrations, strikes, and market strikes against the US-puppet group have successively broken out in Saigon, Da Nang, Hue and other places. The wave of demonstrations quickly spread to more than a dozen other cities in the US-puppet controlled area. In just over a month, millions of people participated in the struggle. The demonstrating masses were furious, not only shouting slogans demanding the overthrow of the Nguyen Cao Ky military dictatorial group, but also directly pointing the spearhead of the struggle at the American aggressors, shouting slogans such as "Down with US imperialism!" and "Yankees go home!"

    The military and political crisis faced by the United States in South Vietnam is a heavy blow to the Johnson administration's plan to expand the war. Militarily, the "dry season offensive" launched by the United States has suffered unprecedented and disastrous defeats. The US aggressor troops and their accomplice troops alone were annihilated by 43,000 people; politically, Johnson had just staged a master-slave "equal footing" farce with Nguyen Cao Ky in Honolulu, trying his best to decorate Nguyen Cao Ky, but only a month later, the puppet clique in Saigon was in chaos, and Nguyen Cao Ky's government was virtually nominal. Western news agencies said that the "bright blueprint" depicted by Johnson at the Honolulu conference has become "broken pieces."

    The current situation in South Vietnam is very favorable for the Vietnamese people to defeat the armed struggle of the American aggressors and their running dogs. The more the American aggressors engage in "gradual escalation" of the war, the more their military and political failures will "gradually escalate"; the more disastrous their defeats on the battlefield, the more the puppet clique will accelerate its disintegration. This vicious cycle is intensifying day by day. No matter how the American aggressors struggle, they cannot escape this law and cannot escape their doomed fate of failure.

### 南越人民反美斗争风起云涌　傀儡集团内讧火并一片混乱  美帝国主义在南越走投无路难保残局

    南越人民反美斗争风起云涌　傀儡集团内讧火并一片混乱
    美帝国主义在南越走投无路难保残局
    据新华社三日讯　随着美国侵略者在南越战场上不断遭到惨败，南越傀儡集团的内讧和美国与其走狗之间的矛盾愈演愈烈；同时，美伪统治区广大人民掀起的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命风暴汹涌澎湃，有力地冲击着摇摇欲坠的美伪统治地位。
    从三月初以来，美国扶植的阮高其—阮文绍集团，同中部地区的阮正诗集团之间的矛盾，由暗中的倾轧发展成了公开的冲突。被阮高其排斥的其他派系，也乘机群起争权，形成群狗争食、乱成一团的局面，在美国的导演和压力下，阮高其集团上演了一幕召开“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧，玩弄举行“大选”和成立“文官政府”的骗局，来安抚各个反对派，延长它的独裁统治。但是，这个欺骗花招遭到了阮正诗集团和其他反对派系的抵制。五月十五日，阮高其突然出兵岘港，用武力进行镇压，这两个集团就在岘港展开了一场真枪实弹的火并。火并持续了八天。阮高其在美国主子的帮助下，终于暂时控制了岘港。目前尽管这两个集团在美国的操纵下酝酿所谓“和解”，但彼此仍在相持，因此连西方通讯社都说，这两个集团之间的尖锐矛盾“仍远未解决”，还可能出现新的“更严重的政治危机”。
    在傀儡集团群狗打架乱成一团的时候，南越美伪统治区各城市的人民，利用这个有利的时机，掀起了强大的反对美伪整个统治的革命斗争风暴，给美伪集团以沉重的打击。从三月中旬开始，西贡、岘港、顺化等地相继爆发了大规模的反对美伪集团的示威，罢工、罢课和罢市，示威的浪潮迅速扩展到美伪统治区的其他十几个城市，参加斗争的群众在短短的一个多月中，就有上百万人。示威群众群情激愤，他们不仅高喊要求打倒阮高其军事独裁集团，而且把斗争的矛头直接指向美国侵略者，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“美国佬滚回去！”等口号。
    美国在南越面临的军事、政治危机，是对约翰逊政府扩大战争的计划的沉重打击。在军事上，美国所发动的“旱季攻势”遭到了空前惨重的失败，只是美国侵略军及其帮凶军就被歼灭了四万三千人；在政治上，约翰逊刚刚在檀香山同阮高其上演了一幕主奴“平起平坐”的丑剧，极力为阮高其装潢门面，但是仅仅过了一个月，西贡的傀儡集团就乱成一团，阮高其的政府实际上已经有名无实。西方通讯社说，约翰逊在檀香山会议上“描绘的光辉的蓝图”，已经成了“破破烂烂的碎片”。
    目前南越的局势，十分有利于越南人民打败美国侵略者及其走狗的武装斗争。美国侵略者越是搞战争“逐步升级”，它在军事上和政治上的失败也跟着“逐步升级”；它在战场上的失败越惨重，傀儡集团就越加速土崩瓦解。这种恶性循环正在日益加剧，不管美国侵略者怎样挣扎，都无法摆脱这个规律，无法逃掉注定失败的命运。
