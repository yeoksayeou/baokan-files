    The decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council regarding the reform of the college entrance examination method was transmitted to Peking University, and revolutionary teachers and students rejoiced and were inspired. They wrote big-character posters in a frenzy and sent them to their revolutionary comrades overnight, banging gongs and drums. To all revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Women's No. 1 Middle School, our dear comrades-in-arms:

    You dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to revolt, demanding to break the shackles of the old entrance examination system and eradicate the root of revisionism. You are doing the right thing, and doing it resolutely. The students of the Psychology Department of the Philosophy Department of Peking University most firmly support your revolutionary actions and extend revolutionary greetings to you!

    We heard the full broadcast of your letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and every word stirred our hearts. We are sincerely excited and proud to have revolutionary comrades-in-arms like you!

    Cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause is a major plan for the Party and the country for thousands and ten thousands of years. It is a matter of life and death related to the fate of the Party and the country. Colleges and universities are one of the important fronts for cultivating proletarian successors. In our country, to fundamentally eliminate the spiritual aristocracy of revisionism and truly cultivate proletarian intellectuals, we must thoroughly reform the education system. This is the inevitable law of history, and this is revolution!

    You proposed that high school graduates should first go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and we very much agree with your approach. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that educated youth should integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, shift their footing to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the great storms and waves of mass struggles, take class struggle as their main course, and improve their awareness, increase their talents, and train themselves into revolutionaries who can withstand wind and frost and shoulder heavy responsibilities in the three great revolutionary movements.

    Now the tide of the Great Cultural Revolution is sweeping the country, impacting all reactionary obstacles and foul and corrupt waters. In this great revolution, you dare to break the old and establish the new, stand high, see far, and are worthy of being good young people of the Mao Zedong era. We hope that you will follow this revolutionary red and expert road to the end and become thorough proletarian revolutionaries!

    Revolutionary comrades-in-arms: Let us join hands, shoulder to shoulder, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight together to the end!

    Long live the Communist Party of China!

    Long live Chairman Mao!

    All first-year students of the Psychology Department of the Philosophy Department of Peking University

    做彻底的无产阶级革命派
    党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定，传到北京大学，革命师生人人欢笑，个个振奋，他们奋笔疾书，纷纷赶写大字报，敲锣打鼓，连夜送给革命战友。北京女一中全体革命师生亲爱的战友们：
    你们敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命，要求打破旧升学制度的枷锁，铲除修正主义的祸根，做得对，做得坚决，我们北大哲学系心理学专业同学们最坚决地支持你们的革命行动，并向你们致以革命的敬礼！
    我们听到了你们给党中央和毛主席信的全文播音，字字句句激奋着我们的心，我们以有你们这样的革命战友而感到由衷的兴奋和自豪！
    培养革命事业的接班人是党和国家的千年大计、万年大计，是关系到党和国家命运的生死存亡的问题。高等学校是培养无产阶级接班人的重要阵地之一。在我国，要从根本上消灭修正主义的精神贵族，真正培养无产阶级的知识分子，就要彻底改革教育制度。这是历史的必然规律，这就是革命！
    你们提出，高中毕业生首先要到工农兵群众中去，我们非常同意你们这种做法。毛主席一再教导我们，知识青年要和工农兵相结合，把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，到群众斗争的大风大浪中，上阶级斗争这门主课，在三大革命运动中，提高觉悟，增长才干，锻炼成经得住风霜，挑得起重担的革命者。
    现在文化大革命的浪潮波及全国，冲击着一切反动障碍和恶流腐水。你们在这个大革命中敢于破旧立新，站得高，看得远，不愧是毛泽东时代的好青年，愿你们顺着这条革命的红专大道走到底，做彻底的无产阶级革命派！
    革命的战友们：让咱们手携手，肩并肩，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，共同奋斗到底！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    北大哲学系心理学专业  一年级全体同学
