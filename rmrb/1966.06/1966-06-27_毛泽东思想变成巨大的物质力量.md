In our country, every day there are countless moving proofs that demonstrate this truth: once the great Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it will become a tremendous material force for transforming society and the world. The advanced example of Comrade Shen Yuling in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is yet another typical case.

Comrade Shen Yuling is a good daughter of the Party, a "sunflower" that has grown up under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. In response to the Party's call, after graduating from junior high school, she resolutely went to the forefront of agriculture. To realize the ideal of "transforming deserts into oases," she bravely joined the team supporting the construction of the border regions. She has a firm belief: "My life is given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao, and I will dedicate my life unconditionally to the revolutionary cause!" Just as she was enthusiastically preparing to dedicate her youth to the motherland, the cruel disease struck her, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. In her struggle against the disease, she found the strongest power in Chairman Mao's works. She diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and actively participated in the class struggle in the countryside. The masses praised her as the "political squad leader who never leaves the door." Though her body is disabled, her spirit is not. The spark of her life will forever bloom!

Material turns into spirit, and spirit turns into material. When the correct ideology representing the advanced class is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force. Mao Zedong Thought is the brilliant inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao on the basis of great revolutionary practice, and it is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. We must propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the workers, peasants, and soldiers through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Only in this way can we change the spiritual face of the laboring people, change the face of the motherland, and make the people of our country stand up and stand up forever!

Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The red sun has risen in the east, and millions of "sunflowers" are blooming!

### 毛泽东思想变成巨大的物质力量

    毛泽东思想变成巨大的物质力量
    在我们的国家里，每天都有无数激动人心的事实证明这样一个真理：伟大的毛泽东思想，一旦被工农兵群众所掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的巨大的物质力量。沈玉英同志活学活用毛主席著作的先进事迹，是又一个典型的例证。
    沈玉英同志是党的好女儿，是在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下成长起来的“向阳花”。她响应党的号召，在初中毕业后，坚决走上了农业第一线。为了实现“变沙漠为绿洲”的理想，她又毅然参加了支援边疆建设的队伍。她有一个坚定的信念：“我的生命是党和毛主席给我的，我要把自己的生命无条件地献给革命事业！”正当她满腔热忱地准备把青春献给祖国的时候，残酷的病魔袭击了她，使她两腿瘫痪了。在和病魔作斗争的过程中，她从毛主席著作中找到了最强大的力量。她努力学习毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想，积极参加农村的阶级斗争。群众赞誉她为“不出门的政治队长”。她身残志不残，她生命的火花永远在开放！
    物质变精神，精神变物质。当代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量。毛泽东思想是毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们一定要通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到工农兵群众中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能改变祖国的面貌，才能使我国人民站起来，永远站起来！
    读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。东方升起了红太阳，亿万朵“向阳花”在盛开着！
