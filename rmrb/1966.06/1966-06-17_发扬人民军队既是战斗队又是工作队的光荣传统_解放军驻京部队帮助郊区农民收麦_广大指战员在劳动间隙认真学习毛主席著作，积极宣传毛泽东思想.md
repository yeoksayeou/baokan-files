    Carrying forward the glorious tradition of the People's Army as both a fighting force and a working force, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the PLA troops stationed in Beijing, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are helping commune members harvest wheat in their stationed areas and in communes and brigades with abundant wheat.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the people of the suburbs of Beijing have overcome severe drought, and this year's wheat presents a scene of abundant harvest. In recent days, the broad masses of cadres, fighters, and some military family members of the PLA stationed in Beijing organs, troops, and universities and colleges have been singing revolutionary songs and heading for the golden wheat fields. Upon arriving at their destinations, they take off their coats and roll up their sleeves, harvesting alongside commune members with sickles in hand. Many comrades' clothes are soaked with sweat, but they do not care at all, and they remain high-spirited and full of energy. The Third Company of a certain unit, which has won the title of "Love-the-People Model Company," carries forward the spirit of daring to be a sharp knife and spearhead, treating the wheat field as a battlefield, and has been harvesting in the front. More than one hundred cadres and fighters of a certain air force unit, each like a brave little tiger, are racing against each other in labor, and in just two days they have helped commune members harvest more than 400 mu of wheat. Some commanders and fighters have blisters on their hands, but they keep in mind Chairman Mao's teachings of not fearing hardship and not fearing fatigue, treating hard labor as happiness, and are still happily harvesting.
    The commanders and fighters never forget to give prominence to politics and never forget to study Chairman Mao's works during their labor. The soldiers of the First Service Company of a certain unit, which has won the "Four Goods" title for five consecutive years, regard the wheat field as a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and diligently study Chairman Mao's works such as "Serve the People" during breaks in labor. They proposed: In the wheat harvest, we must treat difficulties like Jiao Yulu, love the people like Wang Jie, and persevere in completing tasks like Mai Xiande. Before the wheat harvest, a certain air force unit conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the People's Army and enthusiastically helped commune members harvest wheat, starting from 3:00 a.m. on the 13th. Pilot Liu Chuncai said: "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, the sons and daughters of the people, and we must never be separated from the masses of the people or from labor." Many commanders and fighters carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them and hang Chairman Mao's quotation boards in the fields. During rest periods, they also held discussions based on Chairman Mao's teachings and their experiences in labor. They said: We must take Chairman Mao's words as the supreme directive, use the gun to defend our political power, use the pen to denounce the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and other gangs, and use sickles and axes to carry out socialist construction together with the people. During the wheat harvest, the commanders and fighters also actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the commune members and introduced their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. Many temporary warrior performance teams also used rest time to perform short and concise literary programs praising Mao Zedong Thought.
    The PLA cadres and soldiers' assistance in the wheat harvest has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members and cadres in the suburbs. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said excitedly to the soldiers: "The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao care so much for us, we must respond to the call of the new municipal Party committee like you and fight well in this battle of summer harvest, summer planting, and summer hoeing." After listening to the PLA soldiers explaining Chairman Mao's article "Serve the People," several old commune members in the western suburbs said that the PLA soldiers not only helped us harvest wheat, but also brought us Mao Zedong Thought. We must also read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good commune members of Chairman Mao, like the soldiers. Many commune members also warmly praised the PLA commanders and fighters who worked bravely in the wheat harvest, not worthy of being Chairman Mao's good fighters and the people's soldiers.

    解放军驻京部队帮助郊区农民收麦
    广大指战员在劳动间隙认真学习毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想
    许多贫下中农社员对战士们说：党中央、毛主席这样关怀我们，我们一定要象你们一样，响应新市委号召，打好夏收夏种夏锄这一仗
    新华社十六日讯　中国人民解放军驻京部队广大指战员，发扬人民军队既是战斗队又是工作队的光荣传统，根据党中央、毛主席的指示，分别在驻地和到小麦多的社队，帮助社员群众收割麦子。
    北京市郊区人民在党中央、毛主席以及中共中央华北局的领导下，战胜了严重的干旱，今年的小麦呈现一片丰收景象。连日来，解放军驻京机关、部队和院校的广大干部、战士及一部分军人家属，高唱革命歌曲，奔向麦浪滚滚的田野。一到目的地，他们就脱衣挽袖，和社员群众并肩挥镰收割。许多同志的衣服被汗水湿透了，也毫不在意，仍然斗志昂扬，干劲十足。曾荣获“爱民模范连”称号的某部三连，发扬勇于当尖刀、打头阵的精神，把麦地当作战场，一直收割在前面。空军某部干部、战士一百多人，个个象勇猛的小老虎，在劳动中你追我赶，仅两天时间就帮助社员收割了四百多亩麦子。有些指战员手上起了泡，心里牢记毛主席不怕艰苦、不怕疲劳的教导，把艰苦劳动当作幸福，仍然愉快地进行收割。
    指战员们在劳动中，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘学习毛主席著作。连续五年荣获四好的某部勤务一连的战士们，把麦地当作活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，在劳动间隙认真学习毛主席《为人民服务》等著作。他们提出：在麦收中要象焦裕禄那样对待困难，象王杰那样热爱人民，象麦贤得那样坚持完成任务。空军某部在麦收前认真学习了毛主席关于人民军队的教导，从十三日凌晨三点多钟开始，就热情帮助社员收割麦子。飞行员刘春才说：“我们是毛主席的战士，是人民的子弟兵，决不能脱离人民群众，脱离劳动。”许多指战员随身带着《毛主席语录》，在地头田间挂上毛主席语录牌。在休息时间里，他们还根据毛主席的教导和劳动中的体会，进行了座谈。他们说：我们一定要以毛主席的话作最高指示，既要用枪杆子保卫我们的政权，要用笔杆子声讨邓拓等一伙黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行，还要用镰刀斧头和人民群众一道进行社会主义建设。麦收中，指战员们还积极向社员们宣传毛泽东思想，介绍自己学习毛主席著作的体会。不少临时抽调组成的战士演出队，还利用休息时间演出了歌颂毛泽东思想的短小精悍的文艺节目。
    解放军干部、战士帮助麦收，受到郊区广大社员和干部的热烈欢迎。许多贫农下中农社员激动地对战士们说：“党中央、毛主席这样关怀我们，我们一定要象你们一样，响应新市委号召，打好夏收、夏种、夏锄这一仗。”西郊几位老社员听了解放军战士讲解毛主席《为人民服务》一文以后说，解放军战士不仅帮助我们收割了麦子，还给我们带来了毛泽东思想，我们也要象战士们一样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好社员。许多社员还热烈称赞在麦收中英勇劳动的解放军指战员，不愧是毛主席的好战士，人民群众的子弟兵。
