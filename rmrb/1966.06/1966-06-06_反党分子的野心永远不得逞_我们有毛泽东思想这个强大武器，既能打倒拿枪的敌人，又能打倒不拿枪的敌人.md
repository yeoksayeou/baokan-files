    The Anti-Party Elements' Ambitions Will Never Succeed
    We Have Mao Zedong Thought as a Powerful Weapon, Which Can Defeat Both Enemies with Guns and Enemies without Guns
    Liu Kun, Representative of the National People's Congress, Veteran Worker of the Tianxin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant in Zhuzhou, Hunan
    The decision of the CCP Central Committee to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the decision of the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee to reorganize the Peking University Party Committee are exhilarating and joyful events, new victories for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and new victories for Mao Zedong Thought. Our working class firmly supports the Central Committee's decision.
    The main responsible persons of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, under the guise of "socialism," were engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, promoting revisionist wares and cultivating bourgeois successors. They were ambitious and妄想to realize capitalist restoration. Their conspiracy will absolutely not succeed; it cannot be done now, it cannot be done in the future, and it will never be done. We, the people of the whole country, have Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible and all-conquering powerful weapon, which can defeat both enemies with guns and enemies without guns. With Mao Zedong Thought as our demon-revealing mirror, all monsters and demons will be exposed in their true forms, and the truth will be revealed, and they will never escape the giant palm of the people's revolution.
    Although the emergence of a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in our capital, Beijing, is a bad thing, these monsters and demons, once dragged out by the people, become a good thing, serving as excellent negative teachers for us. This socialist cultural revolution has made our sense of smell more sensitive, our eyes brighter, and our vigilance higher.
    Mao Zedong Thought is our revolutionary magic weapon and our lifeblood. We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will resolutely not agree to anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely overthrow this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black elements, eradicate the roots of the black line, resolutely defend the Party Central Committee, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

    反党分子的野心永远不得逞
    我们有毛泽东思想这个强大武器，既能打倒拿枪的敌人，又能打倒不拿枪的敌人
    全国人民代表大会代表、湖南株洲田心机车车辆厂老工人　刘昆
    中共中央决定改组北京市委和新北京市委决定改组北大党委，是一件振奋人心的大喜事，是无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，是毛泽东思想的新胜利，我们工人阶级坚决拥护中央的决定。
    前北京市委的主要负责人打着“社会主义”的招牌，干着反党反社会主义的勾当，宣传的是修正主义一套货色，培养的是资产阶级接班人。他们野心勃勃，妄想实现资本主义复辟，他们的阴谋是绝对不会得逞的，现在办不到，将来办不到，永远也办不到。我们全国人民有毛泽东思想这个攻无不克、战无不胜的强大武器，既能打倒拿枪的敌人，又能打倒不拿枪的敌人。我们有了毛泽东思想这面照妖镜，一切牛鬼蛇神都会原形毕露，真相大白，休想逃脱人民革命的巨掌。
    在我们首都北京出现了一小撮反党反社会主义分子，虽然是件坏事，但是这些牛鬼蛇神一被人民揪出来，就变成了好事，它给我们当了很好的反面教员。这场社会主义文化大革命，使我们的嗅觉更灵敏了，眼睛更亮了，警惕性更高了。
    毛泽东思想是我们的革命法宝，是我们的命根子。谁反对毛泽东思想，我们广大工农兵群众坚决不答应。我们要坚决打倒这一伙反党反社会主义的黑帮分子，铲掉黑线的根子，坚决保卫党中央，保卫社会主义，捍卫毛泽东思想。
