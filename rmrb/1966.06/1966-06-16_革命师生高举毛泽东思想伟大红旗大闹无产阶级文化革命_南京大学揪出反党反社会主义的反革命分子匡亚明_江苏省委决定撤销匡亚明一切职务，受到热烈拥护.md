    Revolutionary Teachers and Students, Holding High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Vigorously Carry Out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
    Nanjing University Exposes the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Counter-Revolutionary Element Kuang Yaming
    Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Decides to Remove Kuang Yaming from All Posts, Receiving Warm Support
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th – Nanjing University held a mass rally of ten thousand people. The vast numbers of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff members, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, angrily exposed and denounced the crimes of the bourgeois representative figure Kuang Yaming, unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely sweep away all monsters and demons and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
    On the afternoon of the 12th, Nanjing University held a general assembly of all teachers and students, mobilizing them to further develop the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and denounce Kuang Yaming's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes. A large number of representatives from major universities and colleges in Nanjing were sent to participate in the assembly. At the meeting, the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to remove Kuang Yaming, First Secretary of the Nanjing University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, from all posts was first announced. After this decision was announced, the entire venue was filled with jubilation, with prolonged and enthusiastic applause and cheers: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live!"
    At the assembly on the 12th, hundreds of teachers and students who had just returned from the Liyang Branch School were warmly welcomed by the teachers and students of the main campus. Students Hu Caiji, Zhu Yingcai, Sun Jiazheng, Wang Xiaozhong, and teacher Su Shouqi, on the stage, with extremely angry emotions, exposed Kuang Yaming's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of suppressing the revolutionary mass movement and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They warmly supported the Provincial Party Committee's decision to remove Kuang Yaming from all posts, saying: We have the leadership of the great Party, the great Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and the support of the broad masses; we will definitely be able to expose Kuang Yaming and all other monsters and demons completely. We will not stop until we overthrow them. Student Chen Jiping from the main campus spoke at the meeting, expressing cordial greetings to the teachers and students who had been attacked by Kuang Yaming. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our mortal enemy. No matter how high his position or how old his qualifications are, we must fight him to the end." Students Tang Lixing, Wang Shitai, Yang Jiayu, Zhang Qiuliang, and others stated one after another: The Provincial Party Committee's decision to remove Kuang Yaming from all posts is a great support to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Nanjing University. We infinitely love Chairman Mao, infinitely love the Party. We want to read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, engage in revolution for a lifetime, forever defend Mao Zedong Thought, and forever fight to the end against all monsters and demons.
    Through the exposure and denunciation of Kuang Yaming, the vast numbers of teachers, students, and staff members have sharpened their eyes and further realized the long-term, acute, and complex nature of class struggle. They unanimously stated: Although Kuang Yaming has been exposed, the poison spread by Kuang Yaming in the school has not been eradicated, and all other monsters and demons have not been exposed. We must drag them out, thoroughly expose them, thoroughly criticize them, and thoroughly overthrow them!
    The meeting on the 12th was presided over by Comrade Hu Wei, Second Secretary of the Nanjing University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who delivered a speech at the meeting.
    The teachers and students of major universities and colleges who participated in the meeting warmly supported the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and firmly supported the struggle of the revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University. When the vast numbers of teachers and students of Nanjing Normal College heard about the meeting at Nanjing University in the morning, they immediately wrote big-character posters supporting the revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University. In the afternoon, they sent more than two hundred representatives, carrying big-character posters and letters of support to participate in the meeting. Representatives from Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing Forestry College, East China Institute of Engineering, and other colleges and universities wrote letters on the spot, unanimously expressing their support for the decision of the Provincial Party Committee and supporting the struggle of the revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University. The representative of Nanjing Normal College said in a letter: "We firmly stand together with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Nanjing University, fight shoulder to shoulder, and resolutely fight against all anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representative figures, overthrow and discredit all bourgeois royalists who resist and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and all monsters and demons. We will not stop until we win complete victory." After the meeting, teachers and students from various colleges and universities wrote big-character posters, wrote letters, and called Nanjing University and Xinhua Daily, expressing warm support for the decision of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and supporting the struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries of Nanjing University.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th – Recently, in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangsu Province, the revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University exposed the reactionary crimes of Kuang Yaming, the First Secretary and President of the university party committee. Kuang Yaming used despicable and vicious conspiratorial means to suppress the revolutionary mass movement within the school and embarked on the anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary road. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to remove Kuang Yaming from all posts.
    Before June 1st, the vast numbers of teachers and students of Nanjing University responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively engaging in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution. On the evening of June 1st, after the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the news of a big-character poster by seven comrades from Peking University, it further aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast numbers of teachers and students of Nanjing University. The revolutionary teachers and students of the Liyang Branch School of Nanjing University, who were engaged in labor to build the school, posted big-character posters on the afternoon of the 2nd. They unanimously supported the just struggle of the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University and at the same time raised serious criticisms against Kuang Yaming's erroneous attitude towards leading the Cultural Revolution.
    Prior to this, a worker wrote a letter to the Nanjing University Party Committee, criticizing the school's compilation of "Proletarian Revolutionary Literature during the League of Left-Wing Writers Period," pointing out that this book tried its best to promote the "thirties" literary tradition and resist Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. The Political Department of the Liyang Branch School of Nanjing University printed this letter, and Kuang Yaming personally wrote a thoroughgoing revisionist "editor's note." This editor's note deliberately confused the nature of this Cultural Revolution, asking students to "engage in academic mass criticism," without mentioning that this was a serious class struggle. The editor's note especially emphasized the "principle of seeking truth from facts," emphasizing that through the movement, it was necessary to "preliminarily formulate future teaching plans and prepare for teaching in the second half of the year," attempting to lead the Cultural Revolution movement onto a wrong path. The editor's note deliberately muddied the waters, wanting to "carry out a mass 'promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology' self-education movement throughout the school," shifting the target of struggle and attacking the leftists. This editor's note also had an "unconscious" here and an "objectively" there, covering up for the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. The first big-character poster written by students Zhou Guanhua, Chen Yunqi, Zheng Liye, Wang Zhongyuan, Wu Xiangqiao and others questioned the Political Department of the Branch School: Were they willing to thoroughly revolutionize? Subsequently, eight second-year students, Cai Qiong, Pan Yuling, Li Weihua, Shi Ruiqin, Wang Xiuying, Bao Yuhua, Zhou Hui, and Su Shouqi, jointly wrote a big-character poster entitled "Ten Questions for Principal Kuang," righteously and sternly questioning Kuang Yaming's erroneous words and deeds regarding the Cultural Revolution. The questions raised in these big-character posters were all correct and well-asked.
    Just because these big-character posters offended the "dignity" of this bourgeois representative figure Kuang Yaming, he openly revealed that bourgeois royalist face. On the afternoon and evening of June 2nd, Kuang Yaming convened successive enlarged meetings of the Party General Branch and general meetings of all party members at the branch school, holding the Party organization hostage, deceiving party members. He first portrayed himself as "absolutely correct," and then maliciously slandered those who criticized him as "ill-intentioned," arranged to immediately organize a "counterattack," incited everyone to "not be soft," and viciously slandered, verbally abused, and intimidated revolutionary teachers and students, calling the big-character posters posted by revolutionary teachers and students "poison arrows."
    On June 3rd, Kuang Yaming continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities frantically. At the enlarged meeting of the Party General Branch he convened in the morning, he ordered further "tracking down," using so-called "discussion meetings" (Note: i.e., struggle sessions) of all sizes to counterattack and strike at the revolutionary faction. In order to set an example, Kuang Yaming personally took the field, bare-chested, participating in the so-called "discussion meetings," and verbally abused revolutionary teachers and students. In the Department of Foreign Languages, he slandered the students who wrote big-character posters as "reactionaries." He even verbally abused some students as being not even as good as "reactionaries." And repeatedly in front of the masses, he pinned various unfounded "hats" on those revolutionary activists, forced them to "examine themselves," and even ordered that the probationary party membership of those who wrote big-character posters should be revoked. These atrocities fully exposed Kuang Yaming's bone-deep hatred for the proletarian revolutionaries as a bourgeois royalist.
    Under Kuang Yaming's planning and organization, in the short four days from the 2nd to the 5th, among the more than five hundred teachers, students, and staff members of the Liyang Branch School, a total of seventy people were struggled against, including sixty-four students, four teachers, and two workers. Among them were nine party members and twenty-two members of the Communist Youth League. Most of them were the children of the working people, and some were the children of revolutionary martyrs. Three of the four League General Branch secretaries, except for one who was not at home, were all struggled against; four models in studying Chairman Mao's works and highlighting politics were also struggled against. Some were falsely accused of being "little Three-Family Village," and some were said to be "black gangs," and were labeled with the hats of "anti-Party and anti-socialist." Some were even subjected to personal insults. After Kuang Yaming returned to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 3rd, he actually strutted about, shouting that the "counterattack" situation was excellent, ordered the Liyang Branch School to "hold on tightly" to the teachers and students who had been struggled against, and immediately convened a meeting of the Party Committee Standing Committee, boastfully touting his "experience" in the Liyang Branch School, and falsely claiming that he had "smashed a six-hour coup." In order to suppress dissenting opinions within the Standing Committee, Kuang Yaming also emphasized "strengthening leadership," "unifying understanding," and "distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves," attempting to continue to attack revolutionary teachers and students and sabotage the Cultural Revolution.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly discovered this serious incident, immediately sent people to conduct inspections, and mobilized the revolutionary faction in the Nanjing University Party organization and the vast numbers of revolutionary teachers and students to thoroughly expose Kuang Yaming's counter-revolutionary crimes. Now, the vast numbers of revolutionary teachers and students of Nanjing University are holding higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further exposing and criticizing Kuang Yaming's counter-revolutionary crimes, sweeping away all monsters and demons, and are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    革命师生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗大闹无产阶级文化革命
    南京大学揪出反党反社会主义的反革命分子匡亚明
    江苏省委决定撤销匡亚明一切职务，受到热烈拥护
    新华社南京十五日电　南京大学举行万人大会，广大革命师生员工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，愤怒揭发和声讨反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物匡亚明的罪行，一致表示要坚决横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    十二日下午，南京大学举行全体师生大会，动员进一步开展无产阶级文化大革命，声讨匡亚明的反党反社会主义的罪行。南京各大专院校推派大批代表参加了大会。在会上，首先宣布了中共江苏省委关于撤销中共南京大学委员会第一书记匡亚明的一切职务的决定。这一决定宣布以后，全场热烈欢腾，长时间地热烈鼓掌欢呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在十二日的大会上，刚从溧阳分校赶回来的几百名师生，受到了校本部师生的热烈欢迎。分校学生胡才基、朱英才、孙家正、王晓中和教师苏寿祁，在台上以极其愤怒的心情，揭发了匡亚明镇压革命群众运动、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的反党反社会主义的罪行。他们热烈拥护省委撤销匡亚明一切职务的决定，说：我们有伟大的党的领导，有伟大的毛泽东思想作武器，有广大群众的支持，一定能够把匡亚明和其他一切牛鬼蛇神全部揭发出来。我们不斗倒他们，决不罢休。校本部学生陈季平在大会上发言，对遭到匡亚明打击的师生表示亲切的慰问。他说：“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的死对头。不管他有多高的职位、多老的资格，我们一定要同他斗争到底。”分校学生唐力行、王世泰、杨家玉、张秋良等纷纷表示：省委撤销匡亚明一切职务的决定，是对南大的无产阶级文化大革命的大撑腰。我们无限地热爱毛主席，无限地热爱党，我们要读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，永远捍卫毛泽东思想，永远和一切牛鬼蛇神斗争到底。
    广大师生员工通过对匡亚明的揭发和声讨，擦亮了眼睛，进一步认识到阶级斗争的长期性、尖锐性和复杂性。一致表示：匡亚明虽然被揭发出来了，但匡亚明在学校散布的毒素还远远没有肃清，其他一切牛鬼蛇神还没有被揭发出来，我们一定要把他们揪出来，彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底打倒！
    十二日的大会是由中共南京大学委员会第二书记胡畏同志主持的，他在会上讲了话。
    参加大会的各大专院校师生热烈拥护中共江苏省委的决定，坚决支持南京大学革命师生的斗争。南京师范学院广大师生上午听说南大要开大会，当时就写了声援南大革命师生的大字报，下午，他们派出了二百多名代表，带着大字报和声援信参加大会。南京工学院、南京林学院、华东工程学院等院校师生代表，都当场写信，一致表示拥护省委的决定，支持南大革命师生的斗争。南京师范学院的代表在信里说：“我们坚决和南大的革命师生员工站在一起，并肩战斗，坚决向一切反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物进行斗争，把一切抗拒和破坏无产阶级文化大革命的资产阶级保皇派，把一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒斗臭，不获全胜，决不收兵。”大会结束以后，各高等院校师生还纷纷写大字报、写信、打电话到南京大学和新华日报社，表示热烈拥护中共江苏省委的决定，支持南大无产阶级革命派的斗争。
    新华社南京十五日电　最近，在江苏省无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，南京大学革命师生揭发了该校党委第一书记兼校长匡亚明的反动罪行。匡亚明以卑鄙毒辣的阴谋手段，镇压校内的革命群众运动，走上了反党反社会主义的反革命道路。中共江苏省委决定撤销匡亚明的一切职务。
    六月一日以前，南京大学广大师生响应了党中央和毛主席的号召，积极投入这场文化大革命的斗争。六月一日晚，中央人民广播电台广播了北京大学七位同志的一张大字报的消息后，进一步激起了南京大学广大师生的革命热情。正在进行劳动建校的南京大学溧阳分校的革命师生，二日下午贴出大字报。他们一致声援北大革命师生的正义斗争，同时对匡亚明领导文化大革命的错误态度，提出了严肃的批评。
    在这以前，有一位工人写信给南大党委，对该校编著的《左联时期无产阶级革命文学》提出批评，指出这本书竭力吹捧“三十年代”文艺传统，抵制毛泽东文艺思想。南大溧阳分校政治处印发了这封信，由匡亚明亲自写了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义的“按语”。这个按语，有意混淆了这场文化大革命的性质，要学生“投入学术大批判运动”，根本不提这是一场严重的阶级斗争。按语特别强调“实事求是的原则”，强调通过运动要“初步拟定今后教学计划，为下半年教学作好准备”，企图把文化大革命运动引到邪路上去。按语故意把水搞浑，要“在全校开展一次群众性‘兴无灭资’的自我教育运动”，转移斗争目标，打击左派。这个按语还左一个“无意识”，右一个“客观上”，为反党反社会主义的黑线打掩护。分校学生周冠华、陈云绮、郑立业、王钟元、吴相乔等写出的第一张大字报，就对分校政治处提出责问：是否愿意彻底革命？接着，二年级学生蔡琼、潘玉玲、李为华、施锐琴、王秀英、鲍玉花、周慧和苏寿祁等八人，联名写了一张《十问匡校长》的大字报，义正词严，向匡亚明对待文化大革命的错误言行提出了责问。这些大字报提出的责问，条条问得对，条条问得好。
    就因为这些大字报，触犯了匡亚明这个资产阶级代表人物的“尊严”，他就公开暴露出那副资产阶级保皇派的嘴脸。六月二日下午和晚上，匡亚明在分校连续召开党总支扩大会和全体党员大会，挟持党组织，欺骗党员，先把自己说成是“绝对正确”，然后别有用心地诬蔑批评他的人是“不怀好意”，布置立即组织“反击”，煽动大家“不能手软”，对革命师生进行恶毒的诬蔑、谩骂和恐吓，把革命师生贴出的大字报说成是“毒箭”。
    六月三日，匡亚明继续猖狂地进行反革命活动。在上午他召集的党总支扩大会上，命令进一步“跟踪追击”，用大大小小的所谓“讨论会”（按：即斗争会）进行反扑，打击革命派。为了做出样子，匡亚明亲自出马，赤膊上阵，参加所谓“讨论会”，破口大骂革命师生。在外语系，他诬蔑写大字报的学生是“反动派”，他甚至谩骂有的学生连“反动派”都不如。并且一再在群众面前，给那些革命积极分子戴上各种无中生有的“帽子”，强迫他们“检讨”，还下命令要一律取消那些写大字报的预备党员的资格。这些暴行，完全暴露了匡亚明这个资产阶级保皇派对无产阶级革命派的刻骨仇恨。
    在匡亚明的策划和组织下，从二日到五日为止的短短四天内，在溧阳分校的五百多师生员工中，被斗的共达七十人，包括学生六十四人，教师四人，工人二人。其中党员九人，团员二十二人。他们大部分是劳动人民的子弟，其中有一些是革命烈士的子女。四个团总支书记，除一个不在家外，三个全被斗了；四个学习毛主席著作、突出政治的标兵，也被斗了。有的被反诬是“小三家村”，有的被说成是“黑帮”，被戴上“反党反社会主义”的帽子。有的甚至遭受到人身侮辱。三日下午匡亚明回到南京后，竟然趾高气扬，叫嚷“反击”形势大好，命令溧阳分校对被斗的师生要“扭住不放”，并立即召开党委常委会，大肆吹嘘他在溧阳分校的“经验”，颠倒黑白地说是“粉碎了一次六小时的政变”。匡亚明为了压制常委会内部的不同意见，还强调“加强领导”，“统一认识”，“分清敌我”，妄图继续打击革命师生，破坏文化大革命。
    中共江苏省委及时发现了这一严重事件，立即派人进行检查，发动南京大学党组织中的革命派和广大革命师生，彻底揭发了匡亚明的反革命罪行。现在，南京大学广大革命师生，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步揭发和批判匡亚明的反革命罪行，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
