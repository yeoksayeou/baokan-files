The full text of the communiqué on the visit of Comrade Zhou Enlai, leading a delegation of the Chinese Party and Government, to Albania is as follows:

At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, a delegation of the Chinese Party and Government, headed by Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, paid a friendly visit to Albania from June 24 to June 28.

During their visit to Albania, the Chinese Party and Government delegation was warmly welcomed by the Albanian people, the Party of Labour of Albania, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania in a fraternal manner. During the visit of the Chinese Party and Government delegation, the Albanian people enthusiastically expressed their boundless love and deep respect for the Chinese people, the great Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people and the honoured friend of Albania, Comrade Mao Zedong.

During his visit to Albania, Comrade Zhou Enlai, leading the Chinese Party and Government delegation, held talks with Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, and other leaders of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania on the question of further strengthening the relations between the two parties and the two countries and on major international issues as well as on the current situation in the international communist and workers' movement. The talks were conducted in a very sincere and warm atmosphere of friendship. Both sides took completely identical views and stands on the questions discussed.

During the talks, both sides reiterated the common stand expressed in the joint statement signed in Beijing on May 11, 1966, by the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu during their visit to China. They pointed out that this statement has great historical significance for the peoples of the two countries and for all the peoples of the world who are struggling for national liberation, people's democracy, socialism, and world peace, against imperialism headed by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries, and against modern revisionism centred on the leadership of the CPSU.

Both sides believe that the visit of the Chinese Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai and the sincere and fraternal talks held between the two sides constitute a new contribution to the further strengthening of the fraternal friendship and unbreakable unity between the peoples, parties, and governments of the two countries, and to socialism and world peace.
