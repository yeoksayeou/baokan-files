    HANOI, June 15 (Xinhua) – The South Vietnam Liberation Army fought a beautiful ambush battle on Highway 13 in the Loc Ninh area of ​​Thu Dau Mot Province on June 11, completely annihilating a company of the U.S. First Infantry Division, heavily damaging two other companies, and capturing a large number of weapons and military supplies, according to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency.
    The report said that after the Liberation Army’s successful attack on Loc Ninh Airport and the Loc Ninh Military Sub-district on the night of June 4, which resulted in the destruction or damage of 27 helicopters and the elimination of 200 enemy soldiers, local guerrillas continuously launched fierce attacks on the enemy's Loc Ninh Military Sub-district command post. On the night of June 10, guerrillas also assisted the people near the Loc Ninh Military Sub-district command post in destroying a series of "strategic hamlets" on Highway 13 and punishing local thugs who were extremely hated by the people.
    Under the continuous attacks of the guerrillas, the U.S.-puppet clique hastily dispatched a battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division on June 11 to provide reinforcements. The Liberation Army seized this favorable opportunity and quickly set up an ambush position in the rubber forest two kilometers northwest of the enemy's Loc Ninh Military Sub-district command post. At about 1:00 p.m. that day, when the U.S. aggressors had just entered the ambush zone, the Liberation Army launched a sudden attack, grabbing the enemy and hitting them hard. At the beginning of the battle, the enemy's command and communication institutions were destroyed. Then, taking advantage of the enemy being in chaos, the Liberation Army soldiers rushed forward, fighting fiercely, and annihilated an enemy company on the spot, inflicting heavy casualties on the other two companies.
    HANOI, June 14 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the military and civilians in the southern western zone of South Vietnam continuously attacked the enemy in May, eliminating a total of 1,998 enemy soldiers, shooting down 14 enemy aircraft, damaging several others, destroying 24 military vehicles of various types, sinking four warships, and seizing more than 140 weapons of various types.
    At the same time, the military and civilians in this area also forced the enemy to withdraw from four strongholds, and liberated more than 16,000 people in the two villages of Ki Bi and Xin Fu in Jin Ou Province. While achieving military victories, the people in the southern western zone also vigorously carried out political struggles. According to incomplete statistics, more than 20,000 people participated in face-to-face struggles with the puppet regime in May, demanding that the U.S. aggressors get out of South Vietnam and demanding the overthrow of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique.

    南越解放军打了一场漂亮的伏击战
    在禄宁地区全歼美军一个连重创两个连
    南越南部西区军民五月份不断出击歼敌近两千
    新华社河内十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放军六月十一日在土龙木省禄宁地区的第十三号公路上打了一场漂亮的伏击战，全歼美国第一步兵师一个连，重创另外两个连，并且缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    报道说，在解放军六月四日夜间袭击禄宁机场和禄宁军事支区取得击毁击伤直升飞机二十七架、歼灭敌军二百人的胜利后，当地游击队连续对敌人的禄宁军事支区指挥所进行猛烈袭击。六月十日夜间，游击队还协助禄宁军事支区指挥所附近人民，捣毁第十三号公路上的一系列“战略村”，并且惩办了当地人民极为痛恨的恶棍。
    在游击队的连续出击下，美伪集团急忙在六月十一日出动美国第一步兵师的一个营前来救援。解放军抓住这个有利战机，迅速地在敌人的禄宁军事支区指挥所的西北两公里的橡胶林里，布下了伏击阵地。当天下午一点钟左右，当美国侵略军刚刚进入伏击圈，解放军就发起突然袭击，揪住敌人猛打。战斗一开始，敌人的指挥和通讯机构就被打烂。接着，解放军的战士们乘敌人乱成一团的时候，冲上前去，猛打猛杀，当场歼灭敌人一个连，并使另外两个连遭到惨重伤亡。
    新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方南部西区军民在五月份里连续不断地袭击敌人，共歼灭敌军一千九百九十八名，击落敌机十四架、击伤多架，击毁各种军车二十四辆，击沉战船四艘，缴获各种武器一百四十多件。
    同时，这个地区的军民还迫使敌人撤出了四个据点，并使金瓯省基裴和新富两个乡的一万六千多人获得解放。在军事上取得胜利的同时，南部西区人民还大力开展政治斗争。据不完全统计，在五月份有两万多人次参加了同伪政权的面对面的斗争，要求美国侵略军滚出越南南方，要求推翻阮文绍—阮高其集团。
