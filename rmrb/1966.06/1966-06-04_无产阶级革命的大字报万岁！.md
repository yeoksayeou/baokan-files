    Long Live the Big-Character Posters of the Proletarian Revolution!
    Xu Zunlu, Dong Cheng, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army
    We were extremely excited after reading a big-character poster written by seven comrades including Nie Yuanzi of Peking University. This is a big-character poster that dares to draw blood with the bayonet, a big-character poster of the proletarian revolution, a big-character poster that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.
      The "pawns" of the "Three-Family Village" black gang, your organization is black, your plans are black, and your hearts are even blacker. When the revolutionary masses are rising up vigorously in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, resolutely counterattacking the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang, you are still shouting to "strengthen leadership and stick to your posts." What kind of posts are you sticking to? Even today, you still want to put up a desperate resistance to sabotage the Great Cultural Revolution. We tell you, these black gang "pawns," the mantis's arms cannot stop the chariot. You want to silence the masses, you can't do it; you won't let the masses write big-character posters, you can't do it; you won't let the masses rise up to make revolution, even more so you can't do it.
    The mass movement is our proletarian revolution's family heirloom. To struggle, to make revolution, is to engage in mass movements, is to have big-character posters. Chairman Mao taught us long ago that revolution is not a dinner party. Revolution is struggle. Only through struggle can there be the dictatorship of the proletariat, can there be the victory of the people, and can there be the liberation of the world's proletariat. You gang of black gang "pawns" still want to engage in secret activities to block the revolutionary movement of the masses and dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The people will never forgive you.
    Today, the revolutionaries of Peking University have risen up. They wield their mighty cudgel to resolutely and thoroughly destroy the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang. These black gang elements are frantically counterattacking and putting up a desperate resistance. This proves that no matter when, all counter-revolutionaries will never willingly accept their own demise. Even if they are destined to fail, they will still put up a desperate resistance. As Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall," "the enemy will not eliminate themselves," and "will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history." This socialist cultural revolution is a life-and-death class struggle, a struggle between the two antagonistic world views of the proletarian world view and the bourgeois world view. We must carry it through to the end.
    Peking University is the people's own university. It is absolutely impossible for bourgeois elements to monopolize the people's university. There are revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and there is invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionaries of Peking University, go ahead and do it! Do it fiercely! We fully support you. Victory must belong to you, and the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be raised high in the new Peking University.

    无产阶级革命的大字报万岁！
    解放军某部　徐尊陆　董诚
    我们看了北京大学聂元梓等七同志的一张大字报，心里万分激动。这是一张敢于刺刀见血的大字报，是无产阶级革命的大字报，是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的大字报。
      “三家村”黑帮的“车马”们，你们的组织是黑的，你们的计划是黑的，你们的心更是黑的。在革命群众轰轰烈烈起来响应党中央和毛主席的号召，坚决反击反党反社会主义黑帮的时候，你们还大喊什么要“加强领导，坚守岗位”。你们坚守的是什么样的岗位？直到今天，你们还要负隅顽抗，来破坏文化大革命。告诉你们这些黑帮“车马”们，螳臂是挡不住车轮的。你们想封群众的口，办不到；不让群众写大字报，办不到；不让群众起来闹革命，更办不到。
    群众运动是我们无产阶级革命的传家宝，要斗争，要革命，就是要搞群众运动，就是要有大字报。毛主席很早就教导过我们，革命不是请客吃饭。革命就是斗争，只有斗争才有无产阶级专政，才有人民的胜利，才有世界无产阶级的解放。你们这伙黑帮“车马”们，还想搞秘密活动，来阻挡群众革命运动，打击群众的革命热情，人民决不饶恕你们。
    今天，北京大学的革命派已经起来了。他们奋起千钧棒，坚决彻底捣毁反党反社会主义的黑帮。这些黑帮分子猖狂反扑，负隅顽抗。这正证明，无论是在什么时候，一切反革命分子都是不会甘心自己的死亡的。他们即使注定要失败了，但是他们仍然要负隅顽抗。正如毛主席所说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”，“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，“都不会自行退出历史舞台”。这场社会主义文化大革命是你死我活的阶级斗争，是无产阶级世界观与资产阶级世界观两个敌对的世界观的斗争，我们必须把它进行到底。
    北京大学是人民自己的大学。资产阶级分子想垄断人民的大学是万万办不到。那里有革命的教师、学生、职工，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，北京大学的革命者们，你们干吧！狠狠地干吧！我们全力支持你们，胜利一定是属于你们的，毛泽东思想伟大红旗一定会在新北大高高举起来的。
