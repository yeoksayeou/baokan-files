Definitely Plant the Five-Star Red Flag in Taiwan Province

On June 27, 1950, the extremely hostile American imperialists, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, armed and occupied the Chinese territory of Taiwan Province. Since then, American imperialism has gradually turned Taiwan Province into its colony and a military base threatening the Chinese mainland and invading Asia.

American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people and the sworn enemy of the Asian people.

Chairman Mao has pointed out that the Taiwan Province occupied by American imperialism and the American military bases in other countries are nooses that American imperialism has manufactured and put around its own neck. Chairman Mao said, "The longer the American aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their necks will become." The facts have fully proven Chairman Mao's wise judgment. Over the past sixteen years, American imperialism has occupied Taiwan Province in China and has been rampantly invading Asia, putting one noose after another around its own neck. The more American imperialism struggles desperately and tries to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Asian people, the tighter the noose around its neck becomes.

To save its failure and get out of its predicament, American imperialism is playing two counter-revolutionary tricks. American imperialism has adjusted its counter-revolutionary global strategy, shifting its strategic focus to Asia. It has sent more troops to South Vietnam, further expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. It has strengthened its military deployments in the western Pacific region, making nuclear threats against the Chinese people and the Asian people, and attempting to encircle and "contain" China. In this counter-revolutionary war plan, Taiwan Province plays an important role. The American magazine *Fortune* openly stated in January this year that Taiwan and Japan "are not only necessary building materials in a containment system but also potential bridges to the rest of Asia, including mainland China." Recently, the United States has manipulated a group of accomplices, puppets, and lackeys, including the Chiang Kai-shek gang, to hold the so-called "Ministerial Conference of the Asia-Pacific Region" in Seoul, organizing a new alliance of aggression, deploying armed attacks against China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and plotting to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is the active war hand of American imperialism.

American imperialism is also desperately playing the "peace" trick. It continues to peddle its "peace talks" fraud through various channels on the Vietnam issue. It has launched a so-called "peace offensive" against China, hypocritically spreading the air of willingness to improve Sino-American relations, saying things like the United States is ready to "adopt a more flexible stance" towards China, "must use every opportunity to express our friendship to the Chinese people," "propose" that the foreign ministers of China and the United States have "face-to-face discussions," and so on. However, American imperialism's trick cannot deceive the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people have already declared that as long as the American aggressor troops do not withdraw from South Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will never stop fighting. As for the so-called "improvement" of Sino-American relations, that is even more deceitful. The United States not only does not withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan Province and the Taiwan Strait, but also does not change its policy of aggression and war against China. Instead, it strengthens its military control over Taiwan Province and tightens its encirclement and "containment" of China. Can this be said to be a willingness to improve Sino-American relations? American imperialism wants to lull the Chinese people into complacency about the American aggression plot. The Chinese people will not be fooled. The Chinese people resolutely raise the banner of anti-Americanism and will fight against American imperialism to the end. American imperialism's counter-revolutionary two-handed strategy will only end in complete failure.

In American imperialism's plot to invade Asia and threaten China, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has played a shameful role as an accomplice. The Soviet leaders have been pretending to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression while actually betraying them, eagerly serving American imperialism's "peace talks" plot. They have adapted to American imperialism's need to encircle and "contain" China and invade Vietnam, advocating the establishment of a "European security system," helping American imperialism shift the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy to Asia. They have even sent representatives to sit with representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the South Vietnamese and South Korean puppet regimes at international conferences, openly serving American imperialism's plot to split China, Vietnam, and Korea. The Soviet leaders' treacherous behavior fully shows that they are enemies of the Asian and world revolutionary people. They will meet the same fate as American imperialism.

Taiwan Province is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan Province, driving American imperialism out of Taiwan Province, and bringing back the Taiwanese compatriots who have been living in misery under the American-Chiang reactionary rule to the embrace of the motherland, and completing the great cause of national reunification, is the sacred mission of the Chinese people. The Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan Province, definitely plant the Five-Star Red Flag in Taiwan Province, and definitely drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan Province. The Chinese people firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world and are determined to drive American imperialism out of Asia and out of all the places it has occupied, together with the people of Asia and all other countries in the world!

### 一定要把五星红旗插到台湾省

    一定要把五星红旗插到台湾省
    一九五○年六月二十七日，极端仇视中国人民和亚洲人民的美帝国主义，在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，武装霸占了中国领土台湾省。从那时候以来，美帝国主义一步一步地把台湾省变成了它的殖民地和威胁中国大陆、侵略亚洲的军事基地。
    美帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的死敌，是亚洲人民不共戴天的死敌。
    毛主席曾经指出，美帝国主义侵占的中国领土台湾省，和美国在外国的军事基地，都是美帝国主义自己制造、并且把它套在自己脖子上的绞索。毛主席说，“美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”事实完全证明了毛主席的这个英明的论断。十六年来，美帝国主义侵占中国的台湾省，在亚洲穷凶极恶地到处进行侵略，给自己套上了一条又一条的绞索。美帝国主义越是进行疯狂的挣扎，妄想镇压亚洲人民的革命斗争，套在它脖子上的绞索也就被拉得越紧。
    美帝国主义为了挽救失败和摆脱困境，正在大肆玩弄反革命的两手。美帝国主义调整了它的反革命全球战略，把战略重点转移到亚洲。它向南越大举增兵，进一步扩大侵略越南的战争。它在西太平洋地区加强军事部署，对中国人民和亚洲人民进行核威胁，妄想包围“遏制”中国。在这个反革命的战争计划中，台湾省占有重要的地位。美国《幸福》杂志在今年一月份公开说，台湾和日本“除了是一项遏制系统中必要的建筑材料外，还是进入亚洲其余地区——包括大陆中国——的潜在桥梁”。最近，美国又操纵包括蒋介石匪帮在内的一伙帮凶、傀儡和仆从，在汉城举行所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”，组织新的侵略同盟，部署对中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的武装进攻，策划进一步扩大侵略越南的战争。这是美帝国主义积极实行的战争的一手。
    美帝国主义还竭力玩弄“和平”的一手。它通过各种渠道，在越南问题上继续兜售它的“和谈”骗局。它对中国发起了所谓“和平攻势”，假惺惺地散布愿意改善中美关系的空气，说什么美国准备对中国“采取较为灵活的立场”啦，“必须利用一切机会向中国人民表示我们的友好”啦，“倡议”中美两国外长进行“面对面的讨论”啦，等等。但是，美帝国主义这一手是骗不了越南人民和中国人民的。越南人民早已宣布，只要美国侵略军队一天不从南越撤走，越南人民就决不停止战斗。至于所谓“改善”中美关系，那更是骗人的鬼话。美国不但不把它的全部武装力量撤出台湾省和台湾海峡，不但不改变它对中国的侵略政策和战争政策，反而加强对台湾省的军事控制，加紧对中国的包围和“遏制”，这能够说是愿意改善中美关系吗？美帝国主义妄想麻痹中国人民对于美国侵略阴谋的警惕。中国人民是决不会上当的。中国人民坚决高举反美旗帜，将反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。美帝国主义的反革命两手策略，只能以彻底的失败而告终。
    在美帝国主义侵略亚洲、威胁中国的阴谋中，苏联修正主义领导集团担任了可耻的帮凶角色。苏联领导人对越南人民的抗美救国斗争假支持，真出卖，竭力替美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。他们适应美帝国主义包围“遏制”中国和侵略越南的需要，鼓吹建立“欧洲安全体系”，帮助美帝国主义把它的反革命全球战略的重心转移到亚洲。他们甚至派出代表，同蒋介石匪帮、南越和南朝鲜傀儡集团的代表坐在一起举行国际会议，明目张胆地替美帝国主义分裂中国、越南和朝鲜的阴谋效劳。苏联领导人这种叛卖行为，充分说明了他们是亚洲和世界革命人民的敌人。他们同美帝国主义一样，决不会有好下场。
    台湾省是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。解放台湾省，把美帝国主义从台湾省赶出去，使在美蒋反动统治下过着痛苦生活的台湾同胞回到祖国怀抱，完成统一祖国的伟大事业，这是中国人民的神圣任务。中国人民一定要解放台湾省，一定要把五星红旗插到台湾省，一定要把美国侵略者从台湾省赶出去。中国人民坚定不移地支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，决心同亚洲和世界各国人民一起，把美帝国主义从亚洲赶出去，从它侵占的一切地方赶出去！
