	Japanese delegation member Shimo Masajuki today at the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers, delivered a report titled "The Cultural Invasion of Japanese Imperialism in Japan and the Development of Japanese National Democratic Culture."

	Shimo Masajuki said in his report that in Japan, due to the government colluding with American imperialism, turning our country into an important base for invading the Pacific, and intensifying the revival of Japanese militarism, the Japanese people have become more determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people and engage in a common struggle.

	He mentioned that Japanese writers are opposing the cultural invasion of American imperialism and are fighting for the development of Japanese national democratic culture. This struggle is indispensable for the true liberation and independence of the Japanese people. He said that American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries fear the power of the united Japanese people, so they have further strengthened their attacks in the cultural and ideological spheres to destroy the unity of the people and undermine the fighting will of the people.

	He said that the cultural invasion of American imperialism in Japan, like in the political and economic spheres, is conducted directly and indirectly, and is combined with the attacks of the Japanese reactionaries on the people. After the 1961 Tokyo emergency meeting of Asian and African writers, the infiltration of modern revisionism into culture has become more apparent. These three forces are conducting ideological attacks on the Japanese people.

	Shimo Masajuki condemned the intensification of the revival of militarism and imperialism by American imperialism and the Japanese ruling class, which has been promoting the "theory of modernizing Japan," "theory of Japan as a great power," "nationalism," and "theory of affirming the Greater East Asia War," and other imperialist arguments. Now, in Japan, there are even novels and films that praise invasion wars and the emperor system.

	He said that while the American and Japanese reactionaries are conducting cultural attacks, they are openly suppressing and plotting to divide the people's resistance to this cultural invasion, the movements and organizations that protect and develop national democratic culture, and are imposing reactionary organizations from above. They also expel cultural workers from unions, progressive journalists, scholars, and others from their jobs, exclude progressive writers and artists from the news industry, and take away their pens and livelihoods.

	Shimo Masajuki said that the Japanese people demand to take Japan back into their own hands, and the struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices is intensifying.

	He said, to further strengthen the common struggle against American imperialism and its Japanese reactionary accomplices, as well as against modern revisionism that compromises with it, and to further strengthen the unity of Asian and African peoples and writers, let us move forward together.

    日本代表团团员霜多正次的报告
    新华社二十九日讯　日本代表团团员霜多正次今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上，作了题为《美帝国主义在日本的文化侵略和日本的民族民主文化的发展》的报告。
    霜多正次在报告中说，在日本，由于政府勾结美帝国主义，把我们的国土作为侵略“太平洋的重要据点”，加紧复活日本军国主义，我们日本人民更加坚定了配合越南人民的战斗、共同进行斗争的决心。
    他谈到，日本作家反对美帝国主义的文化侵略，并正为日本的民族民主文化而进行斗争。这个战斗，对争取日本人民的真正的解放和独立是不可缺少的。他说，美帝国主义和日本反动派害怕日本人民团结起来的力量，所以进一步加强了文化、意识形态方面的进攻，以便破坏人民的团结，从思想上瓦解人们的斗争意志。
    他说，美帝国主义在日本进行的文化侵略，和在政治、经济方面一样，是直接地、间接地进行的，并且是结合日本反动派对人民的进攻来进行的。在一九六一年亚非作家东京紧急会议之后，更加明显的是现代修正主义对文化的渗透。这三者对日本人民进行思想攻击。
    霜多正次谴责美帝国主义和日本统治阶级加紧复活军国主义、帝国主义以来，大肆鼓吹“日本近代化论”、“日本大国论”、“国家主义论”、“大东亚战争肯定论”等帝国主义论调。现在在日本甚至出现了赞美侵略战争、赞美天皇制的小说和电影。
    他说，美日反动派在进行文化进攻的同时，对于人民反抗这种文化侵略，保卫和发展民族民主文化的运动和组织，则从组织上和活动上采取露骨的镇压和分裂阴谋，拼凑同这些组织相对抗的反动组织，从上而下强加给人民。他们还把工会的文化工作干部、进步的新闻工作者、学者等赶出其工作岗位，排斥进步的作家、艺术家在新闻界活动，夺去他们的笔杆和粮食。
    霜多正次说，日本人民要求把日本夺回到自己手中，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争日益加强。
    他说，为了进一步加强对美帝国主义和它的帮凶日本反动派，以及和它妥协的现代修正主义的共同斗争，为了进一步加强对亚非人民和作家的团结，我们携手前进吧。
