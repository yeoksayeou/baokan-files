    Running Enterprises According to Mao Zedong Thought, Carrying Out the Struggle to Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology
    The Revolutionary Spirit of Fertilizer Industry Workers is Greatly Boosted, Production is Flourishing
    From January to May this year, fertilizer production exceeded the quota by 500,000 tons. Advanced enterprises maintained a steady high yield this year; enterprises with previously poor production improved their production levels; some newly commissioned enterprises broke old conventions and quickly reached and exceeded their designed levels.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th—The broad masses of workers on China's fertilizer industry front, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved new victories in production this year. From January to May, the daily fertilizer production level showed a significant increase compared to the highest level of the fourth quarter of last year, with a total overproduction of 500,000 tons of fertilizer. The quality of nitrogen fertilizer remained stable, and the quality of phosphate fertilizer also improved further. The consumption of electricity, raw materials, and other materials generally decreased, and production costs also fell.
    This year, large, medium, and small fertilizer plants across the country have emphasized politics, extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, learning from the Daqing experience, and using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the workforce. The workers' class consciousness has been enhanced, their revolutionary spirit invigorated, production has reached new levels, and the enterprises have shown a new look. Advanced enterprises have maintained a steady high yield this year, becoming even more advanced. Enterprises with previously poor production have caught up rapidly, and their production levels have made significant progress. Some newly commissioned enterprises have broken old conventions and, with a latecomer's momentum, quickly reached and exceeded their designed levels.
    Fertilizer plants across the country have widely launched mass movements to learn from Daqing and create "Five-Good" enterprises. In this mass movement, all factories have placed the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all their work and, in conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's works, have deeply unfolded great discussions on the relationship between politics and production, politics and technology, and politics and business. The broad masses of workers, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticized muddled ideas and erroneous understandings such as "politics is a soft task, production is a hard task"; "the factory is for production, production is everything, everything is subordinate to production, everything serves production"; and "politics and business can be emphasized in turns." They clarified that politics is the soul, politics is the commander, and emphasizing politics must first be implemented in the ideological revolutionization of people. Many leading cadres of enterprises, through the great debate on emphasizing politics, further clarified that they must run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle as the key link and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, carrying out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, and building a workforce that is extremely proletarian and extremely militant. The great debate further promoted the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works, especially promoting the workers' hard work in transforming their thinking. The broad masses of workers used the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of non-proletarian ideology, breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and further establishing the idea that all work is to carry out revolution and the idea of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. Revolutionary enthusiasm soared as never before. They said, removing the word "I" increases ambition, not fearing the word "bitter" is for the people, not fearing the word "death" is for the revolution. They spent time on "studying," put effort into "applying," and saw the results in "doing."
    While studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way and striving to transform their own thinking, the broad masses of workers also used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve various problems and difficulties encountered in the movement to increase production and practice economy. They established the idea of all work being for the revolution in production, striving to increase fertilizer production and support agricultural production.
    In order to thoroughly change the technological face of production, fertilizer plants have adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and workers, as well as combining factories, scientific research departments, and universities, concentrating efforts to conduct new technology experiments. This year, fertilizer plants across the country conducted over seventy key new technology experiments. Some of these projects are new technologies that shorten production processes and simplify equipment, while others are new technologies that fully utilize local resources. Currently, some of these new technologies have achieved initial results, and some are in the process of developing plans. The success of these new technologies will raise China's fertilizer production technology level to a new level.
    This year, mass-based technical innovation and technical revolution have become more in-depth and widespread. Workers have put forward many innovative suggestions targeting weak links in production and have achieved results in production. In nitrogen fertilizer production, gas generators and compressors are the main equipment for manufacturing synthetic ammonia. Since last year, after nitrogen fertilizer plants across the country generally increased the production capacity of compressors, the production capacity of gas generators could not keep up with demand, limiting the increase in synthetic ammonia production. This is the main key to increasing production this year. Fertilizer plants across the country, targeting this key, widely mobilized the masses to carry out technical innovations. When the gas generation workshop of the Nanjing Fertilizer Plant solved this key, it first organized workers to study Chairman Mao's articles "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?", "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to enhance confidence and muster courage. They said that only through practice can they master the laws of production and gain the initiative. In the past, they operated according to old operating requirements, and the carbon layer in the gas generator was low, making it easy to overturn. After careful analysis, they believed that this was the key affecting the further improvement of the gas generator's production capacity. After many experiments, they gradually explored a new operating method of "high carbon layer, high air volume, high furnace temperature." After all gas generators in the workshop adopted this operating method, production capacity increased by more than 30%. With a high degree of political responsibility, workers at fertilizer plants across the country also operated carefully, trying to shorten downtime, increase gas production time, and increase the production capacity of gas generators. At present, all plants have basically achieved one gas generator matching one compressor, and some plants have even achieved "seven furnaces matching nine machines," promoting a general increase in synthetic ammonia production capacity.
    In phosphate fertilizer production, the main task this year is to continue to improve the quality of phosphate fertilizer and the utilization rate of phosphate rock powder. Most of the phosphate rock powder used by phosphate fertilizer plants across the country is relatively poor, medium-to-low grade rock powder. However, the quality of phosphate fertilizer has been steadily improved, and the first-grade product rate of phosphate fertilizer has increased significantly. The conversion rate in phosphate fertilizer production has also generally increased by more than 3% compared to last year, and phosphate rock powder has been more fully utilized. The product quality of the Kunyang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant in Yunnan Province used to be relatively poor, and the conversion rate was relatively low. They believed that the raw materials and equipment were relatively poor, and they could not produce first-grade products. This year, after the socialist education movement, the workers of this plant established the idea of serving agriculture wholeheartedly, not only producing first-grade products but also significantly improving the conversion rate.
    The leading departments of the fertilizer industry believe that the fertilizer plants across the country must further recognize the great significance of emphasizing politics, deeply and thoroughly debate the relationship between politics and production, business, and technology, clarify the direction of enterprise construction, consciously adhere to putting politics in command in all work, run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, and actively participate in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution. In production, it is necessary to continue to boldly mobilize the masses, carry out technical innovations and technical revolution, and further tap production potential. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen equipment maintenance in a timely manner to ensure the normal operation of equipment, so that the production upsurge can continue to develop, increase the production of more and better fertilizers, and support agricultural production.

    按照毛泽东思想办企业　开展兴无灭资的斗争
    化肥工业职工革命精神大振生产欣欣向荣
    今年一至五月份共超产化肥五十万吨。先进企业今年持续稳定高产；原来生产较差的企业，生产水平提高；一些新投产的企业，打破老框框，迅速达到和突破了设计水平。
    新华社南京九日电　我国化肥工业战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，今年在生产上又取得了新的胜利。一月到五月，化肥日产水平比去年最高水平的第四季度又有了显著提高，共超产了五十万吨化肥。氮肥质量稳定，磷肥质量也有了进一步提高。电力、原料、材料等消耗普遍下降，生产成本也有降低。
    今年，各地大中小化肥厂突出政治，大学毛主席著作，大学大庆经验，用毛泽东思想武装职工队伍，按照毛泽东思想办企业，职工阶级觉悟提高，革命精神振奋，生产创出了新水平，企业出现了新面貌。先进企业今年持续稳定高产，先进更先进。原来生产比较差的企业，急起直追，生产水平有了长足的提高。一些新投入生产的企业，打破了老框框，以后来居上的姿态，迅速达到和突破了设计水平。
    各地化肥工厂广泛地开展了学大庆、创五好的群众运动。在这个群众运动中，各厂都把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，并且结合学习毛主席著作深入展开了政治与生产、政治与技术、政治与业务关系的大讨论。广大职工以毛泽东思想为武器，批判了“政治是软任务，生产是硬任务”；“工厂是搞生产的，生产就是一切，一切服从于生产，一切服务于生产”；“政治与业务可以轮流突出”等等糊涂观念和错误认识，明确了政治是灵魂，政治是统帅，突出政治必须首先落实到人的思想革命化。许多企业的领导干部，通过突出政治大辩论，进一步明确了必须按照毛泽东思想办企业，以阶级斗争为纲，以两条道路斗争为纲，开展兴无产阶级思想灭资产阶级思想的斗争，建设一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的职工队伍。大辩论又进一步推动了学习毛主席著作的热潮，特别是促进了职工在改造思想上狠下功夫。广大职工用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射非无产阶级思想之“的”，破私立公，兴无灭资，进一步树立了一切工作都是干革命的思想和全心全意为中国人民与世界人民服务的思想，革命热情空前高涨。他们说，去掉“我”字长志气，不怕“苦”字为人民，不怕“死”字为革命。他们在“学”字上花了时间，在“用”字上下了功夫，在“干”字上看出了效果。
    广大职工在活学活用毛主席著作，努力改造自己思想的同时，又以毛泽东思想为武器，解决增产节约运动中碰到的各种问题和困难。他们在生产中确立了一切工作为革命的思想，努力增产化肥，支援农业生产。
    各化肥厂为了彻底改变生产技术面貌，采取领导干部、技术人员、工人三结合，以及工厂、科学研究部门、大专院校三结合的办法，集中力量进行新技术的试验。今年全国各化肥厂进行重点试验的新技术共有七十多项。这些项目有的是缩短生产流程、简化设备的新技术，有的是充分利用当地资源的新技术。现在，这些新技术有的已经取得了初步成效，有的正在制定方案。这些新技术获得成功，将使我国化肥生产技术水平提高到一个新的水平。
    今年，群众性的技术革新、技术革命更加深入广泛。职工们针对生产上的薄弱环节，提出了许多革新建议，并且在生产上取得了效果。在氮肥生产中，煤气炉和压缩机是制造合成氨的主要设备。去年以来，各地氮肥厂普遍提高了压缩机的生产能力以后，煤气炉生产能力跟不上需要，限制了合成氨产量的增加。这是今年增产的主要关键。各地化肥厂针对这个关键，广泛发动群众开展技术革新。南京化肥厂造气车间在解决这一关键时，首先组织职工学习毛主席的《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》《矛盾论》《实践论》《愚公移山》等文章，增强信心，鼓起勇气。他们说，只有通过实践，才能掌握生产规律，取得主动。过去，他们按照老的操作要求操作，煤气炉中的炭层低，容易吹翻。他们经过认真分析，认为这是影响煤气炉生产能力进一步提高的关键。经过多次试验，他们逐步摸索出一套“高炭层、高风量、高炉温”的新的操作方法。全车间各个煤气炉都采用这种操作方法以后，生产能力提高了百分之三十以上。各地化肥厂职工还以高度的政治责任心，认真操作，尽量缩短停炉时间，增加造气时间，提高煤气炉的生产能力。目前，各厂基本上都实现了一台煤气炉顶一台压缩机，有的厂还实现了“七炉顶九机”，促使合成氨生产能力普遍提高。
    在磷肥生产中，今年主要任务是继续提高磷肥质量和磷矿粉利用率。各地磷肥厂使用的磷矿粉大部分是比较差的中低品位的矿粉。可是磷肥质量稳定提高，磷肥的一级品率大幅度增加。磷肥生产中的转化率也普遍比去年提高百分之三以上，磷矿粉得到了更充分的利用。云南昆阳磷肥厂过去产品质量比较差，转化率比较低。他们认为原料、设备都比较差，生产不出一级品。今年这个厂经过社会主义教育运动，职工们树立了全心全意为农业服务的思想，不仅生产出了一级品，转化率也显著提高。
    化肥工业领导部门认为，当前各地化肥厂必须进一步认识突出政治的伟大意义，把政治与生产、业务、技术的关系辩深论透，明确企业的建设方向，自觉地在一切工作中坚持政治挂帅，按照毛泽东思想办企业，并且要积极参加社会主义文化大革命。在生产中，必须继续放手发动群众，开展技术革新、技术革命，进一步挖掘生产潜力。同时，必须及时加强设备检修，保证设备正常运转，使生产高潮持续发展，增产更多更好的化肥，支援农业生产。
