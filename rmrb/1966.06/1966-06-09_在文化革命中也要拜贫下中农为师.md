    In the current Cultural Revolution of great historical significance, in the new era when the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly mount the academic forum, we respond to the call of the Party, take advantage of the favorable conditions of part-work and part-study in the countryside, go among the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and study Chairman Mao's books with them, and participate in the Cultural Revolution together. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a firm stance, clear banners, are good at identifying fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, grasp the crux of the problem sharply, and explain the truth thoroughly in a few words, which has given us extremely profound education, corrected many wrong ideas, and gradually solved some long-standing controversial issues.

    Practice has proved that the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Cultural Revolution. Without their participation, the socialist Cultural Revolution cannot achieve complete victory. Only when intellectuals combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and participate in the battle with them can they play their role in the Cultural Revolution.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants are Most Concerned About the Cultural Revolution

    Initially, we had some doubts and wrong ideas about whether the poor and lower-middle peasants were concerned about the Cultural Revolution and could actively participate in the battle. Some students thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants only cared about production and the socialist education movement in the team. What did they know about Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha? How could they participate in academic criticism? A few students even mistakenly believed that they would not care about the major events of the Cultural Revolution at all.

    However, the facts have educated us that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are not only very concerned about the current serious class struggle, but have also become soldiers charging into battle in the Cultural Revolution. After hearing the fallacies of the Deng Tuo gang against the Party and socialism, they all felt extremely indignant. With the determination to defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, they immediately took action and devoted themselves to this battle with full enthusiasm, and many moving scenes appeared.

    Poor peasant warehouse keeper Liu Wentong's family of five, from adults to children, wrote three letters of determination and two critical articles such as "Resolutely Overthrow Deng Tuo - Refuting 'Great Empty Talk'" that night, and worked until after one o'clock in the morning. Poor peasant youth Zhang Zhenlu was on duty at night managing the electric well, and did not rest during the day, writing a critical article: "Wu Han Stands on Chiang Kai-shek's Position to Oppose the War of Liberation." We advised him to rest, but he said, "Rest? How can I rest if Wu Han is not overthrown? If Wu Han and these monsters and demons seize power, where can I rest!"

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have deep feelings for the Party and socialism. The anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of Deng Tuo and his like aroused their unparalleled anger. Poor peasant Jiang Jikun said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants think of Chairman Mao every day, so much so that we miss him so much, but these bad guys curse our Party and Chairman Mao every day. How can we allow them to be presumptuous? We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree!" Jiang Jichang, a poor peasant feeder nearly seventy years old, was so angry that his beard stood on end after hearing Deng Tuo's reactionary remarks. He said, "What are Deng Tuo and his gang! Who are they speaking for? I think Deng Tuo is a big poisonous snake, and poisonous snakes bite people. We must get rid of it."

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants realized that our struggle with Deng Tuo and others is by no means just a "paper war," nor is it a matter of no overall importance, but a matter of the utmost importance related to the vital interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the fate of our Party and country. Old poor peasant Qin Baoyu said, "What Deng Tuo said is anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, wanting us to go back to the old society. If Deng Tuo is not overthrown, China will change color, and my descendants will become hired laborers." Poor peasant Aunt Yang said, "The enemy with guns has been eliminated, but the enemy with pens has not been eliminated. Deng Tuo's pen is a black gun. He wants to use the pen to seize our gun. We must seize the pen! If they are in power, the suffering of the old society will be replayed." Poor peasant Wang Qingmin said, "Deng Tuo is a wolf in sheep's clothing, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and doing bad things to restore capitalism. He is a rightist who escaped the net and a time bomb that must be dug out quickly."

    In these days of battle, we listened, watched, and thought, comparing ourselves, and felt particularly excited. Everyone deeply felt that compared with the poor and lower-middle peasants, our attitude towards this serious class struggle was too far behind. The poor and lower-middle peasants actively joined the battle with infinite love for our great Party and beloved leader Chairman Mao, and with bitter hatred for the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. But we did not have such strong class feelings or such a high sense of political responsibility. In the past, some people wrote critical articles just to cope with exams. When others wrote, they didn't use their brains. Once the exam was over, they put the relevant materials in a box, thinking everything was fine. Some students wrote critical articles to get published in the newspaper and become famous. Even a few students, fearing that their exam results would be affected, simply avoided this struggle and chose exam questions unrelated to academic criticism.

    Participating in the Cultural Revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants fundamentally changed this situation. Under the influence of the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we threw away the stinking baggage of individualism and fought side by side with them. Many students, unafraid of hardship and fatigue, worked hard day and night, forgetting sleep and food. Some students seized the time at night to read materials and hold forums, and during the day they participated in labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, discussing while working. In a short period of time, we not only sorted out the materials of the poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others, and spoke for the poor and lower-middle peasants, but also improved our class consciousness and strengthened our fighting ability.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Understand History Best

    Originally, some students thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants could participate in academic criticism and discuss some political views, but when it came to historical knowledge, they might not be able to do it. They said: Even we college students have read books for more than ten years and have not finished reading the Twenty-Four Histories; the poor and lower-middle peasants have "low culture" and "little historical knowledge," how can they fight against "generalists" like Deng Tuo and "Ming history experts" like Wu Han?

    The facts corrected our misconceptions. Those who really understand history are definitely not the landlord and bourgeois "experts" who regard the Twenty-Four Histories as golden rules, but the working people who really create history.

    For example, in school, some of our classmates had a dispute over the issue of Hai Rui's water conservancy project. Wu Han said that Hai Rui's "construction of water conservancy was beneficial to farmers, especially to poor and middle peasants." At that time, some students believed that Hai Rui's dredging of the Wusong River, regardless of his subjective motives, would have a beneficial effect on production in objective effect and would bring some benefits to farmers.

    The views of the poor and lower-middle peasants were completely opposite. Poor peasant Zhang Ziqiang said angrily: "What! Landlord officials build water conservancy for us poor people? There is no such thing. Even if he builds water conservancy, it is for the landlords and wealthy people to use. There is no share for us poor farmers at all. Besides, poor people have no land, and they don't need his water!" Grandpa Zhang also accused: "Before liberation, opening rivers was the corvée labor of farmers. The landlords and officials, under the banner of doing things for the poor, extorted the poor, squeezed our blood and sweat, and forced the poor to dig rivers and build water conservancy for them. After it was built, it was also for their use. We poor people could only sweat and bleed, be treated as cattle and horses, and get no benefit at all. Building water conservancy enriches the rich and impoverishes the people." Poor peasant Aunt Xiao Changyu further said, "We poor people have no land. The land belongs to the landlords. If the water conservancy is well built and more grain is produced, won't we pay more rent? The landlords rent bad land to the poor people. When you take care of the land and it withstands floods and droughts, the landlords will either increase the rent or take the land back. Even if a little more grain is produced, it won't reach the hands of our poor and lower-middle peasants!"

    The poor and lower-middle peasants have no land, and no matter how well the water conservancy is built, the poor cannot benefit from it at all. For the poor and lower-middle peasants who have suffered from the landlords' exploitation and oppression, this is originally the simplest and clearest truth, but we don't understand it. Because we have not been subjected to the landlords' cruel oppression and exploitation, and we don't understand the miserable family history of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we cannot completely stand on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants and analyze problems from the class point of view of the proletariat. This is precisely the manifestation of our lack of class viewpoint and lack of the ideological feelings of the working people.

    For example, the issue of so-called "honest officials." In school, some students believed that we cannot say that there were any "good officials" in feudal society, but the difference between "honest officials" and "corrupt officials" still exists. Not admitting this is not specific analysis of specific problems.

    The views of the poor and lower-middle peasants are diametrically opposed to ours. Poor peasant Liu Deliang said angrily: "Deng Tuo and Wu Han are simply talking nonsense! The officials in the old society were all protecting each other and harming the people. There was not a single good thing! The 'honest officials' in the old operas were all created by the landlords to make us poor people willingly accept their rule." Revolutionary martyr's family member Aunt Liu also accused us: "My husband and son were both killed by the landlord bastards. Did that 'honest official master' save us? The landlords and their officials are all wolves and dogs. Their hearts are black. Even dogs would not eat them if they were taken out. He killed three members of our family, and I will hate them for the rest of my life, and I will hate them even after death." Lower-middle peasant Liu Decai also revealed with his own experience: "In 1945 of the Republic of China, my thirteen mu of land, three houses, and a vegetable garden were occupied by the rich peasant Liu Dexi. I went to the pseudo-Changping County Court to sue, but Liu Dexi had money and power and bribed the government, so I was kicked out. In that world, the handle of the knife was in the hands of the rich. Where can we poor people have a place to complain!"

    Based on their own experiences, the family history and village history written by the poor and lower-middle peasants with blood and tears profoundly prove that there were no "honest officials" in the old society at all. They said: "Crows are generally black," "The tiger in the south mountain and the tiger in the north mountain both eat people!" Treating the poor, "corrupt officials stab with one knife and peel off the skin alive; 'honest officials' cut with zero knives and suffer alive"; "Landlords and the officials of the landlord class are the deadly enemies of our poor and lower-middle peasants. If they exist, we will not exist."

    Facts once again show that without understanding the family history and village history of the poor and lower-middle peasants who were oppressed and exploited in the old society, we cannot truly understand what is class, what is class struggle, and we cannot truly understand history. Those who truly understand history are not the bourgeois intellectuals, but the poor and lower-middle peasants. They are the most qualified to speak on historical issues. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants can not only participate in academic criticism, but also tell many revolutionary truths that intellectuals cannot think of and cannot tell. Because they have red hearts and bright eyes, their criticism of the Deng Tuo gang is also incisive, accurate, hard-hitting, deep-criticizing, and thoroughly refuted, which is what we cannot match. Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous." In the Cultural Revolution, this truth has been proved once again.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants are Best at Using Mao Zedong Thought to Fight

    Why can the poor and lower-middle peasants have such keen political sense of smell and be able to reveal the reactionary essence of the Deng Tuo gang so profoundly? In this period of combat life, we deeply realized that, in the final analysis, it is the result of their deeply studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, and mastering Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon.

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words most, and firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings that classes and class struggle still exist in socialist society. When they heard the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of Deng Tuo and others, everyone was very angry. They firmly believe that with the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely be able to dig out the monsters and demons like Deng Tuo, make them reveal their true colors, and completely overthrow and discredit them, and pull them out by the roots. Old poor peasant Jiang Jikun said, "Don't look at Deng Tuo and Wu Han being cunning, pretending to be bulls and horses, opposing the Party and socialism, but when our Chairman Mao emphasizes politics and grasps class struggle, he will dig them out." Warehouse keeper Liu Wentong also said, "Chairman Mao's works are really effective. As long as you seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do things according to Chairman Mao's words, the demons and ghosts will be afraid. Enemies with guns are easy to catch, and enemies without guns are also easy to deal with." Communist Youth League member Qin Changming saw the reactionary views of Deng Tuo and Wu Han published in the newspaper and did not sleep all night, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations, recalled family history, compared them with Deng Tuo's views, refuted them one by one, and wrote critical articles. She said, "No matter how Deng Tuo and his gang beat around the bush, when we use Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate them, they will not be able to stand."

    Xiao Changyu heard Deng Tuo say that "benevolent rule is better than hegemony" and that we should not exercise dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. He angrily said: "This is completely nonsense! Chairman Mao said: We must exercise dictatorship over the reactionaries, 'Only allow them to be obedient and not allow them to talk nonsense and move around.' 'Otherwise, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.' To talk about human feelings with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, without dictatorship, is not revolution, it is letting us stretch out our heads for the enemy to chop. Deng Tuo's saying that 'benevolent rule is better than hegemony' is speaking for the landlord class and openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought."

    In the breeding farm, we studied with feeder Jiang Jichang Chairman Mao’s quotations on the role of the people in history, and told him Deng Tuo and Wu Han’s fallacies of beautifying emperors, generals, and ministers. He immediately retorted: "What, Wu Han said that emperors, generals, and ministers made great contributions to history? This is clearly opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said that the people are the creators of history. What we eat, wear, and use are created by the working people. The world was created by us poor people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The landlord class does nothing but exploit us working people. Without us working people, these bastards would freeze to death and starve to death. Deng Tuo and Wu Han said that the working people have no achievements. I ask, who made the contribution of overthrowing one emperor after another? Who made the contribution of defeating Chiang Kai-shek? Wu Han's heart is really poisonous. He beautifies emperors, generals, and ministers, and demeans the working people. He dreams of putting us poor and lower-middle peasants under the ground again! We poor and lower-middle peasants have read Chairman Mao's books and understand how to use Mao Zedong Thought to look at history. Wu Han's nonsense cannot deceive people. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and always be the main force of the revolution."

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible sharp weapon, to fight against the Deng Tuo gang. In comparison, we college students feel extremely ashamed! Originally, we studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought every day, read Chairman Mao's books all day long, but because we were separated from the three major revolutionary practices, and did not make great efforts in the word "use," and could not study and apply it in a living way, we did not have a clear understanding of the Deng Tuo gang's rampant attacks for a long time. Even after understanding the nature of this struggle, we still underestimated its seriousness. When some students criticized Wu Han's "theory of honest officials," they also read Chairman Mao's books, and especially read "Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society," but after reading it again and again, they still admitted the existence of "honest officials," and tried to make a "one divides into two" analysis of "honest officials," saying that they had both merits and faults; both achievements and shortcomings. In the end, not only could they not grasp the essence of the problem, but they also fell into eclecticism and the theory of class reconciliation.

    Although the poor and lower-middle peasants do not have a high level of education, in this Cultural Revolution, they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and set an example for us in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. We deeply realized that to completely defeat all monsters and demons and to carry this Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works and make great efforts in the word "use," just like the poor and lower-middle peasants.

                  ＊  ＊  ＊

    The great Cultural Revolution movement has washed away all the stale ideas and theories of the old society, and also eliminated the bourgeois individualism in our minds. Our participation in the Cultural Revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants has given us a profound education. Many students have initially found the gap between themselves and the poor and lower-middle peasants. As some students said: The poor and lower-middle peasants have a more stable class stand than us, a more sensitive political sense of smell, deeper class feelings, higher revolutionary enthusiasm, more accurate views on problems, and better and more lively use of Chairman Mao's works than us. Everyone unanimously said that they must always combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in the three major revolutionary practices, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and narrow this gap as soon as possible.

    We are students who work and study part-time in the countryside. Poor peasant Grandpa Jiang Jichang said to us earnestly: "Tito has changed, Khrushchev has changed, and some people who play with pens in our China have also changed. Will you change in the future? I don't know. It's good that you came down this time! College students grow their own land to produce grain, and build their own houses to live in, which is very good! If you continue to do this, you will not deteriorate in the future!" We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and never disappoint the expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and vow to do a good job in part-work and part-study, and be determined to take root in the countryside for the rest of our lives, roll in a thick mud, and be a proletarian revolutionary successor who will never change color.

    在文化革命中也要拜贫下中农为师
    中国人民大学哲学系学生　任则
    在当前这场具有伟大历史意义的文化大革命中，在工农兵群众直接登上学术论坛的新时代，我们响应党的号召，利用在农村半工半读的有利条件，到贫下中农中去，拜他们为师，向他们学习，和他们一起读毛主席的书，一起参加文化革命。广大贫下中农立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，善于识别香花和毒草，一针见血地抓住问题的要害，三言两语就把道理讲得透彻明白，使我们受到了极其深刻的教育，纠正了许多错误认识，有些长期以来争论不清的问题也逐步解决了。
    实践证明，工农兵群众是文化革命的主力，没有他们参加，社会主义文化革命就不能取得彻底胜利。知识分子只有和工农兵群众相结合，和他们一起参加战斗，才能在文化革命中发挥自己的作用。
    贫下中农最关心文化革命
    起初，我们对贫下中农是否关心文化革命，能否积极参加战斗，曾经有过一些疑虑和错误的想法。有的同学以为，贫下中农只关心生产，关心队里的社会主义教育运动，那里知道什么邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙，那里会参加什么学术批判？个别同学甚至极其错误地认为，他们根本不会关心文化革命的大事。
    但是，事实教育了我们，广大贫下中农不仅十分关心当前这场严重的阶级斗争，而且在文化革命中已经成为冲锋陷阵的战士。当他们听了邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的谬论以后，无不感到万分愤慨，他们抱着保卫党，保卫社会主义，保卫毛泽东思想的决心，立即行动起来，以满腔的热情投入了这场战斗，出现了许多感人肺腑的场面。
    贫农保管员刘文通一家五口，从大人到小孩，当晚就写了三份决心书和《坚决斗倒邓拓——驳〈伟大的空话〉》等两篇批判文章，一直搞到深夜一点多钟。贫农青年张振禄，晚上值班管理电井，白天不休息，写了批判文章：《吴晗站在蒋介石的立场上反对解放战争》。我们劝他休息，他说：“休息？不把吴晗斗倒，我怎么能休息？让吴晗这些牛鬼蛇神夺去印把子，我上那儿去休息！”
    广大贫下中农对党对社会主义有着深厚的感情，邓拓之流的反党反社会主义活动，激起了他们的无比愤怒。贫农蒋纪坤说：“我们贫下中农天天想念毛主席，想得要命，可是这伙坏蛋，天天骂我们的党和毛主席，我们怎能容许他们放肆呢？我们贫下中农决不答应！”年近七十的贫农饲养员蒋纪常，听了邓拓的反动言论后，气得胡子都竖了起来。他说：“邓拓这伙是什么东西！他们是替谁说话？我看邓拓是大毒蛇，毒蛇是要咬人的，我们非把它除掉不可。”
    广大贫下中农认识到，我们和邓拓等人的斗争，决不只是打打“笔墨官司”，决不是什么无关大局的事，而是关系到贫下中农的切身利益，关系到我们党和国家命运的头等大事。老贫农秦宝玉说：“邓拓讲的那些话，就是反党反社会主义的黑话，要咱们回到旧社会去。不把邓拓斗倒，中国就要变颜色，我的子孙后代就要当长工。”贫农杨大妈说：“拿枪的敌人消灭了，拿笔的敌人还没有消灭，邓拓的笔就是一杆黑枪，他是想用笔杆子夺我们的枪杆子。我们要把笔杆子夺过来！让他们掌了权，旧社会的苦难生活就要重演。”贫农王庆民说：“邓拓是披着羊皮的狼，打着红旗反红旗，干的是复辟资本主义的坏事。他是个漏网的右派分子，是颗定时炸弹，必须赶紧把它挖掉。”
    在这些战斗的日子里，我们听着、看着、想着，对照自己，心情格外激动。大家深深感到，对待这场严肃的阶级斗争，我们的态度与贫下中农比较起来，实在是相差太远了。贫下中农怀着对我们伟大的党、敬爱的领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对反党反社会主义分子切齿痛恨，积极投入战斗。而我们却没有这样强烈的阶级感情，没有这样高度的政治责任感。在过去，有的人写批判文章，只是为了应付考试，别人执笔时自己就不开动脑筋；考试一完，竟把有关的资料装进箱子，认为万事大吉了。有的同学写批判文章是为了登报出名。甚至有个别同学，怕影响自己的考试成绩，干脆回避这场斗争，选择与学术批判无关的考题。
    和贫下中农一起参加文化革命，根本改变了这种状况。在贫下中农高昂的革命热情影响下，我们丢掉了个人主义的臭包袱，和他们并肩战斗。许多同学不怕苦不怕累，废寝忘食，日夜苦斗。有的同学晚上抓时间看材料，开座谈会，白天还和贫下中农一起参加劳动，边劳动边议论。在不长的时间里，我们不仅整理出了贫下中农批判邓拓、吴晗等人的材料，为贫下中农说了话，而且提高了自己的阶级觉悟，加强了战斗的能力。
    贫下中农最懂历史
    原先，有的同学认为，贫下中农参加学术批判，搞一些政治观点还可以，但一涉及历史知识，恐怕未必能行。他们说：连我们这些大学生，念了十几年书，还没有读完二十四史；贫下中农“文化低”，“历史知识少”，怎么斗得过邓拓这样的“杂家”和吴晗这样的“明史专家”呢？
    事实纠正了我们的错误认识。真正懂得历史的，决不是那些把二十四史奉为金科玉律的地主、资产阶级“专家”，而是真正创造历史的劳动人民。
    例如，在学校里，我们有些同学曾就海瑞修水利问题有过争论。吴晗说，海瑞“兴修水利，对农民、特别是对贫农、中农是有利的”。当时，有些同学认为海瑞疏通吴淞江，不管其主观动机如何，在客观效果上，总是有利于生产，多少会给农民带来一些好处。
    贫下中农的看法完全相反。贫农张子强气愤地说：“什么！地主官老爷为我们穷人修水利，没有那个事。他就是修了水利，也是叫地主老财使用，根本没有咱们贫苦农民的份。再说，穷人没有地，也用不着他的水！”张大爷还控诉说：“在解放前，开河就是农民的苦役。地主、官老爷打着为穷人办事的牌子，向穷人搜刮，把我们的血汗搜刮尽啦，再逼着穷人去给他们挖河、修水利，修成后也归他们用，我们穷人只有流汗流血，当牛当马，半点好处也没有。修水利是富了财主，苦了百姓”。贫农萧长玉大妈进一步说：“咱们穷人没有地，地都是地主的，修好水利多打点粮食，还不是多交点租子，有什么光好沾？地主把坏地租给穷人种，等你把土地侍弄好啦，抗住了水灾、旱灾，地主不是加租就是把地收回去。即便多打了一点粮食，也到不了咱们贫下中农的手啊！”
    贫下中农没有地，水利修得再好，穷人根本沾不上光。对于受尽地主剥削压迫的贫下中农来说，这本来是最简单明白的道理，可是我们就不懂得。因为我们没有受过地主的残酷压迫与剥削，不懂得贫下中农的苦难家史，所以不能完全站在贫下中农一边，用无产阶级的阶级观点分析问题。这正是我们缺乏阶级观点、缺乏劳动人民的思想感情的表现。
    又如，所谓“清官”问题。在学校里，有些同学认为，不能讲封建社会有什么“好官”，但是“清官”和“贪官”的区别，总还是存在的。不承认这点，就不是具体问题具体分析。
    贫下中农的看法和我们截然相反。贫农刘德良大爷气愤地说：“邓拓、吴晗简直是胡说八道！旧社会的官都是官官相卫，坑害老百姓的，没有一个好东西！旧戏里的‘清官’都是地主老爷造出来的，是让我们穷人甘心情愿受他们的统治。”革命烈属刘大妈还向我们控诉说：“我的丈夫和儿子都叫地主坏蛋弄死啦，那个‘清官大老爷’救过我们？地主和他们的官都是狼心狗肺，心都是黑的，掏出来狗都不吃。他杀死了我们一家三口，我要恨他们一辈子，死了也恨他们。”下中农刘德才也以自己的亲身经历揭露：“民国三十四年，我的十三亩地、三间房、一个菜园子，被富农刘德喜霸占了，我去伪昌平县法院告状，刘德喜有钱有势，买通了官府，我就被轰了出来。那个世道，刀把子握在有钱人的手里，咱穷人那有申冤诉苦的地方！”
    贫下中农根据自己的亲身经历，用血和泪写成的家史、村史，深刻地证明了旧社会根本没有什么“清官”。他们说：“天下乌鸦一般黑”，“南山虎，北山虎都是吃人的！”对待穷人，“贪官是一刀戳，活剥皮；‘清官’是零刀割，活受罪”；“地主和地主阶级的官是咱贫下中农的死对头，有他们就没有咱们”。
    事实一次又一次的说明，不了解旧社会贫下中农受压迫受剥削的家史、村史，就不能真正懂得什么是阶级，什么是阶级斗争，也就不能真正懂得历史。真正懂得历史的不是那些资产阶级知识分子，而是贫下中农，他们最有资格在历史问题上发言。广大贫下中农不仅能够参加学术批判，而且能够讲出许多知识分子想不到、讲不出的革命道理。由于他们心红眼亮，对邓拓一伙的批判也就一针见血，抓得准、打得狠、批得深、驳得透，这正是我们所不及的。毛主席说，“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，在文化革命中，又一次证明了这是真理。
    贫下中农最会运用毛泽东思想进行战斗
    贫下中农为什么能够有如此敏锐的政治嗅觉，能够那样深刻地揭露邓拓一伙的反动本质呢？在这一段战斗生活中，我们深深体会到，归根到底，是因为他们带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作、掌握毛泽东思想这一强大武器的结果。
    广大贫下中农最听毛主席的话，牢牢记住毛主席关于社会主义社会还存在阶级和阶级斗争的教导。当他们听到邓拓等人的反党反社会主义的谬论之后，个个非常气愤。他们坚信：用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，一定能够揪出邓拓这些牛鬼蛇神，使它们原形毕露，把它们彻底斗倒斗臭，连根拔掉。贫农蒋纪昆老大爷说：“你甭看邓拓、吴晗狡猾，装成牛头马面，反党反社会主义，咱毛主席一突出政治，一抓阶级斗争，就把他们揪出来了。”保管员刘文通也说：“毛主席著作真灵，只要认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的话办，妖魔鬼怪就害怕了。拿枪的敌人好抓，不拿枪的敌人也好办”。共青团员秦常明，看到报纸上发表了邓拓、吴晗的反动观点之后，一夜没睡觉，反复学习毛主席语录，回忆家史，对照邓拓的观点，一条一条加以驳斥，并写了批判文章。她说：“不管邓拓一伙怎样拐弯抹角，咱用毛泽东思想一照，它就站不住脚了。”
    贫农萧长玉听到邓拓说“王道比霸道好”，要我们不要对地富反坏实行专政之后，气愤地说：“这完全是胡说八道！毛主席说：对反动派就得实行专政独裁，‘只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动’，‘不这样，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。’对地富反坏讲人情，不专政，就是不革命，就是让我们伸出脑袋让敌人砍。邓拓说‘王道比霸道好’，就是替地主阶级说话，公开反对毛泽东思想。”
    我们在饲养场里，和饲养员蒋纪常一起学习毛主席关于人民群众在历史上的作用的语录，又把邓拓、吴晗美化帝王将相的谬论讲给他听，他马上反驳道：“什么，吴晗说帝王将相在历史上的贡献大，这是明着反对毛泽东思想，毛主席讲人民群众才是历史的创造者。吃的、穿的、用的是劳动人民创造的，天下是咱穷人在毛主席领导下打出来的。地主阶级什么也不干，就知道剥削咱劳动人民，没有咱劳动人民，这些混蛋都得冻死、饿死。邓拓、吴晗说劳动人民没有成就，试问打翻一个一个皇帝是谁的功劳？打垮蒋介石又是谁的功劳？吴晗的心真毒，他美化帝王将相，贬斥劳动人民，是梦想把我们贫下中农重新压在地底下！我们贫下中农读了毛主席的书，懂得了用毛泽东思想来看历史，吴晗的鬼话就骗不了人，我们一定要听毛主席的话，永远当革命的主力军。”
    广大贫下中农就是这样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的锐利武器来和邓拓一伙作斗争的。对比之下，我们这些大学生感到无比惭愧！本来，我们天天学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，整天念毛主席的书，但是，由于脱离三大革命实践，没有在“用”字上狠下功夫，不能活学活用，因此，对于邓拓一伙的猖狂进攻，我们长期认识不清，即使在了解了这场斗争的性质之后，对它的严重性也还是估计不足。有的同学在批判吴晗“清官论”时，虽然也读了毛主席的书，还特别读了《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文，但读来读去，还是承认“清官”的存在，并力图对“清官”作“一分为二”的分析，说它既有功的一面，又有过的一面；既有成绩，又有缺点。弄来弄去，结果不仅抓不住问题的本质，而且还陷入折衷主义和阶级调和论。
    贫下中农虽然文化水平不高，但是，在这场文化大革命中，他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在活学活用毛主席著作方面，给我们树立了榜样。我们深深体会到，要彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神，要把这场文化大革命进行到底，就必须象贫下中农那样，努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
                  ＊  ＊  ＊
    伟大的文化大革命运动，涤荡了旧社会的一切陈腐观念和学说，也破除了我们头脑中的资产阶级个人主义思想。我们和贫下中农一起搞文化革命，使我们受到了深刻的教育。许多同学初步找到了自己和贫下中农的差距。正如有的同学所说：贫下中农的阶级立场比我们稳，政治嗅觉比我们灵，阶级感情比我们深，革命积极性比我们高，看问题比我们准，毛主席著作比我们学得好用得活。大家一致表示，一定要永远和工农兵群众相结合，积极参加三大革命实践，虚心向贫下中农学习，尽快地缩小这个差距。
    我们是在农村半工半读的学生，贫农蒋纪常大爷语重心长地对我们说：“铁托变了，赫鲁晓夫变了，我们中国有些耍笔杆子的人也变了。你们将来会不会变呢？不知道了。你们这次下来很好！大学生自己种地出粮食，自己盖房住，这就很好嘛！你们这样搞下去，将来就不会变质！”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，决不辜负贫下中农的期望，誓将半工半读搞好，立志在农村扎根一辈子，滚上一身厚泥巴，做永不变色的无产阶级革命接班人。
