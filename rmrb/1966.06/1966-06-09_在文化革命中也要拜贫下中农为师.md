    In the current Cultural Revolution of great historical significance, in the new era when the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly mount the academic forum, we respond to the call of the Party, take advantage of the favorable conditions of part-work and part-study in the countryside, go among the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and study Chairman Mao's books with them, and participate in the Cultural Revolution together. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a firm stance, clear banners, are good at identifying fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, grasp the crux of the problem sharply, and explain the truth thoroughly in a few words, which has given us extremely profound education, corrected many wrong ideas, and gradually solved some long-standing controversial issues.

    Practice has proved that the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Cultural Revolution. Without their participation, the socialist Cultural Revolution cannot achieve complete victory. Only when intellectuals combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and participate in the battle with them can they play their role in the Cultural Revolution.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants are Most Concerned About the Cultural Revolution

    Initially, we had some doubts and wrong ideas about whether the poor and lower-middle peasants were concerned about the Cultural Revolution and could actively participate in the battle. Some students thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants only cared about production and the socialist education movement in the team. What did they know about Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha? How could they participate in academic criticism? A few students even mistakenly believed that they would not care about the major events of the Cultural Revolution at all.

    However, the facts have educated us that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are not only very concerned about the current serious class struggle, but have also become soldiers charging into battle in the Cultural Revolution. After hearing the fallacies of the Deng Tuo gang against the Party and socialism, they all felt extremely indignant. With the determination to defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, they immediately took action and devoted themselves to this battle with full enthusiasm, and many moving scenes appeared.

    Poor peasant warehouse keeper Liu Wentong's family of five, from adults to children, wrote three letters of determination and two critical articles such as "Resolutely Overthrow Deng Tuo - Refuting 'Great Empty Talk'" that night, and worked until after one o'clock in the morning. Poor peasant youth Zhang Zhenlu was on duty at night managing the electric well, and did not rest during the day, writing a critical article: "Wu Han Stands on Chiang Kai-shek's Position to Oppose the War of Liberation." We advised him to rest, but he said, "Rest? How can I rest if Wu Han is not overthrown? If Wu Han and these monsters and demons seize power, where can I rest!"

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have deep feelings for the Party and socialism. The anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of Deng Tuo and his like aroused their unparalleled anger. Poor peasant Jiang Jikun said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants think of Chairman Mao every day, so much so that we miss him so much, but these bad guys curse our Party and Chairman Mao every day. How can we allow them to be presumptuous? We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree!" Jiang Jichang, a poor peasant feeder nearly seventy years old, was so angry that his beard stood on end after hearing Deng Tuo's reactionary remarks. He said, "What are Deng Tuo and his gang! Who are they speaking for? I think Deng Tuo is a big poisonous snake, and poisonous snakes bite people. We must get rid of it."

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants realized that our struggle with Deng Tuo and others is by no means just a "paper war," nor is it a matter of no overall importance, but a matter of the utmost importance related to the vital interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the fate of our Party and country. Old poor peasant Qin Baoyu said, "What Deng Tuo said is anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, wanting us to go back to the old society. If Deng Tuo is not overthrown, China will change color, and my descendants will become hired laborers." Poor peasant Aunt Yang said, "The enemy with guns has been eliminated, but the enemy with pens has not been eliminated. Deng Tuo's pen is a black gun. He wants to use the pen to seize our gun. We must seize the pen! If they are in power, the suffering of the old society will be replayed." Poor peasant Wang Qingmin said, "Deng Tuo is a wolf in sheep's clothing, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and doing bad things to restore capitalism. He is a rightist who escaped the net and a time bomb that must be dug out quickly."

    In these days of battle, we listened, watched, and thought, comparing ourselves, and felt particularly excited. Everyone deeply felt that compared with the poor and lower-middle peasants, our attitude towards this serious class struggle was too far behind. The poor and lower-middle peasants actively joined the battle with infinite love for our great Party and beloved leader Chairman Mao, and with bitter hatred for the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. But we did not have such strong class feelings or such a high sense of political responsibility. In the past, some people wrote critical articles just to cope with exams. When others wrote, they didn't use their brains. Once the exam was over, they put the relevant materials in a box, thinking everything was fine. Some students wrote critical articles to get published in the newspaper and become famous. Even a few students, fearing that their exam results would be affected, simply avoided this struggle and chose exam questions unrelated to academic criticism.

    Participating in the Cultural Revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants fundamentally changed this situation. Under the influence of the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we threw away the stinking baggage of individualism and fought side by side with them. Many students, unafraid of hardship and fatigue, worked hard day and night, forgetting sleep and food. Some students seized the time at night to read materials and hold forums, and during the day they participated in labor with the poor and lower-middle peasants, discussing while working. In a short period of time, we not only sorted out the materials of the poor and lower-middle peasants criticizing Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others, and spoke for the poor and lower-middle peasants, but also improved our class consciousness and strengthened our fighting ability.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Understand History Best

    Originally, some students thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants could participate in academic criticism and discuss some political views, but when it came to historical knowledge, they might not be able to do it. They said: Even we college students have read books for more than ten years and have not finished reading the Twenty-Four Histories; the poor and lower-middle peasants have "low culture" and "little historical knowledge," how can they fight against "generalists" like Deng Tuo and "Ming history experts" like Wu Han?

    The facts corrected our misconceptions. Those who really understand history are definitely not the landlord and bourgeois "experts" who regard the Twenty-Four Histories as golden rules, but the working people who really create history.

    For example, in school, some of our classmates had a dispute over the issue of Hai Rui's water conservancy project. Wu Han said that Hai Rui's "construction of water conservancy was beneficial to farmers, especially to poor and middle peasants." At that time, some students believed that Hai Rui's dredging of the Wusong River, regardless of his subjective motives, would have a beneficial effect on production in objective effect and would bring some benefits to farmers.

    The views of the poor and lower-middle peasants were completely opposite. Poor peasant Zhang Ziqiang said angrily: "What! Landlord officials build water conservancy for us poor people? There is no such thing. Even if he builds water conservancy, it is for the landlords and wealthy people to use. There is no share for us poor farmers at all. Besides, poor people have no land, and they don't need his water!" Grandpa Zhang also accused: "Before liberation, opening rivers was the corv√©e labor of farmers. The landlords and officials, under the banner of doing things for the poor, extorted the poor, squeezed our blood and sweat, and forced the poor to dig rivers and build water conservancy for them. After it was built, it was also for their use. We poor people could only sweat and bleed, be treated as cattle and horses, and get no benefit at all. Building water conservancy enriches the rich and impoverishes the people." Poor peasant Aunt Xiao Changyu further said, "We poor people have no land. The land belongs to the landlords. If the water conservancy is well built and more grain is produced, won't we pay more rent? The landlords rent bad land to the poor people. When you take care of the land and it withstands floods and droughts, the landlords will either increase the rent or take the land back. Even if a little more grain is produced, it won't reach the hands of our poor and lower-middle peasants!"

    The poor and lower-middle peasants have no land, and no matter how well the water conservancy is built, the poor cannot benefit from it at all. For the poor and lower-middle peasants who have suffered from the landlords' exploitation and oppression, this is originally the simplest and clearest truth, but we don't understand it. Because we have not been subjected to the landlords' cruel oppression and exploitation, and we don't understand the miserable family history of the poor and lower-middle peasants, we cannot completely stand on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants and analyze problems from the class point of view of the proletariat. This is precisely the manifestation of our lack of class viewpoint and lack of the ideological feelings of the working people.

    For example, the issue of so-called "honest officials." In school, some students believed that we cannot say that there were any "good officials" in feudal society, but the difference between "honest officials" and "corrupt officials" still exists. Not admitting this is not specific analysis of specific problems.

    The views of the poor and lower-middle peasants are diametrically opposed to ours. Poor peasant Liu Deliang said angrily: "Deng Tuo and Wu Han are simply talking nonsense! The officials in the old society were all protecting each other and harming the people. There was not a single good thing! The 'honest officials' in the old operas were all created by the landlords to make us poor people willingly accept their rule." Revolutionary martyr's family member Aunt Liu also accused us: "My husband and son were both killed by the landlord bastards. Did that 'honest official master' save us? The landlords and their officials are all wolves and dogs. Their hearts are black. Even dogs would not eat them if they were taken out. He killed three members of our family, and I will hate them for the rest of my life, and I will hate them even after death." Lower-middle peasant Liu Decai also revealed with his own experience: "In 1945 of the Republic of China, my thirteen mu of land, three houses, and a vegetable garden were occupied by the rich peasant Liu Dexi. I went to the pseudo-Changping County Court to sue, but Liu Dexi had money and power and bribed the government, so I was kicked out. In that world, the handle of the knife was in the hands of the rich. Where can we poor people have a place to complain!"

    Based on their own experiences, the family history and village history written by the poor and lower-middle peasants with blood and tears profoundly prove that there were no "honest officials" in the old society at all. They said: "Crows are generally black," "The tiger in the south mountain and the tiger in the north mountain both eat people!" Treating the poor, "corrupt officials stab with one knife and peel off the skin alive; 'honest officials' cut with zero knives and suffer alive"; "Landlords and the officials of the landlord class are the deadly enemies of our poor and lower-middle peasants. If they exist, we will not exist."

    Facts once again show that without understanding the family history and village history of the poor and lower-middle peasants who were oppressed and exploited in the old society, we cannot truly understand what is class, what is class struggle, and we cannot truly understand history. Those who truly understand history are not the bourgeois intellectuals, but the poor and lower-middle peasants. They are the most qualified to speak on historical issues. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants can not only participate in academic criticism, but also tell many revolutionary truths that intellectuals cannot think of and cannot tell. Because they have red hearts and bright eyes, their criticism of the Deng Tuo gang is also incisive, accurate, hard-hitting, deep-criticizing, and thoroughly refuted, which is what we cannot match. Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous." In the Cultural Revolution, this truth has been proved once again.

    Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants are Best at Using Mao Zedong Thought to Fight

    Why can the poor and lower-middle peasants have such keen political sense of smell and be able to reveal the reactionary essence of the Deng Tuo gang so profoundly? In this period of combat life, we deeply realized that, in the final analysis, it is the result of their deeply studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings, and mastering Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon.

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words most, and firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings that classes and class struggle still exist in socialist society. When they heard the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of Deng Tuo and others, everyone was very angry. They firmly believe that with the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely be able to dig out the monsters and demons like Deng Tuo, make them reveal their true colors, and completely overthrow and discredit them, and pull them out by the roots. Old poor peasant Jiang Jikun said, "Don't look at Deng Tuo and Wu Han being cunning, pretending to be bulls and horses, opposing the Party and socialism, but when our Chairman Mao emphasizes politics and grasps class struggle, he will dig them out." Warehouse keeper Liu Wentong also said, "Chairman Mao's works are really effective. As long as you seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do things according to Chairman Mao's words, the demons and ghosts will be afraid. Enemies with guns are easy to catch, and enemies without guns are also easy to deal with." Communist Youth League member Qin Changming saw the reactionary views of Deng Tuo and Wu Han published in the newspaper and did not sleep all night, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations, recalled family history, compared them with Deng Tuo's views, refuted them one by one, and wrote critical articles. She said, "No matter how Deng Tuo and his gang beat around the bush, when we use Mao Zedong Thought to illuminate them, they will not be able to stand."

    Xiao Changyu heard Deng Tuo say that "benevolent rule is better than hegemony" and that we should not exercise dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. He angrily said: "This is completely nonsense! Chairman Mao said: We must exercise dictatorship over the reactionaries, 'Only allow them to be obedient and not allow them to talk nonsense and move around.' 'Otherwise, the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.' To talk about human feelings with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, without dictatorship, is not revolution, it is letting us stretch out our heads for the enemy to chop. Deng Tuo's saying that 'benevolent rule is better than hegemony' is speaking for the landlord class and openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought."

    In the breeding farm, we studied with feeder Jiang Jichang Chairman Mao‚Äôs quotations on the role of the people in history, and told him Deng Tuo and Wu Han‚Äôs fallacies of beautifying emperors, generals, and ministers. He immediately retorted: "What, Wu Han said that emperors, generals, and ministers made great contributions to history? This is clearly opposing Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said that the people are the creators of history. What we eat, wear, and use are created by the working people. The world was created by us poor people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The landlord class does nothing but exploit us working people. Without us working people, these bastards would freeze to death and starve to death. Deng Tuo and Wu Han said that the working people have no achievements. I ask, who made the contribution of overthrowing one emperor after another? Who made the contribution of defeating Chiang Kai-shek? Wu Han's heart is really poisonous. He beautifies emperors, generals, and ministers, and demeans the working people. He dreams of putting us poor and lower-middle peasants under the ground again! We poor and lower-middle peasants have read Chairman Mao's books and understand how to use Mao Zedong Thought to look at history. Wu Han's nonsense cannot deceive people. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and always be the main force of the revolution."

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible sharp weapon, to fight against the Deng Tuo gang. In comparison, we college students feel extremely ashamed! Originally, we studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought every day, read Chairman Mao's books all day long, but because we were separated from the three major revolutionary practices, and did not make great efforts in the word "use," and could not study and apply it in a living way, we did not have a clear understanding of the Deng Tuo gang's rampant attacks for a long time. Even after understanding the nature of this struggle, we still underestimated its seriousness. When some students criticized Wu Han's "theory of honest officials," they also read Chairman Mao's books, and especially read "Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society," but after reading it again and again, they still admitted the existence of "honest officials," and tried to make a "one divides into two" analysis of "honest officials," saying that they had both merits and faults; both achievements and shortcomings. In the end, not only could they not grasp the essence of the problem, but they also fell into eclecticism and the theory of class reconciliation.

    Although the poor and lower-middle peasants do not have a high level of education, in this Cultural Revolution, they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and set an example for us in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. We deeply realized that to completely defeat all monsters and demons and to carry this Cultural Revolution through to the end, we must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works and make great efforts in the word "use," just like the poor and lower-middle peasants.

                  Ôºä  Ôºä  Ôºä

    The great Cultural Revolution movement has washed away all the stale ideas and theories of the old society, and also eliminated the bourgeois individualism in our minds. Our participation in the Cultural Revolution with the poor and lower-middle peasants has given us a profound education. Many students have initially found the gap between themselves and the poor and lower-middle peasants. As some students said: The poor and lower-middle peasants have a more stable class stand than us, a more sensitive political sense of smell, deeper class feelings, higher revolutionary enthusiasm, more accurate views on problems, and better and more lively use of Chairman Mao's works than us. Everyone unanimously said that they must always combine with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in the three major revolutionary practices, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and narrow this gap as soon as possible.

    We are students who work and study part-time in the countryside. Poor peasant Grandpa Jiang Jichang said to us earnestly: "Tito has changed, Khrushchev has changed, and some people who play with pens in our China have also changed. Will you change in the future? I don't know. It's good that you came down this time! College students grow their own land to produce grain, and build their own houses to live in, which is very good! If you continue to do this, you will not deteriorate in the future!" We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and never disappoint the expectations of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and vow to do a good job in part-work and part-study, and be determined to take root in the countryside for the rest of our lives, roll in a thick mud, and be a proletarian revolutionary successor who will never change color.
