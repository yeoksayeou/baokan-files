    South Vietnamese Buddhist Anti-American Demonstrations Spread to Urban and Rural Areas
    Hue City Shops, Vendors, and Students Strike to Support Buddhists
    (Xinhua News Agency, Eighth dispatch from Saigon) Saigon News: Buddhists and masses in Hue, Saigon, and other places have continued to hold demonstrations and rallies in the past two days to oppose the US-puppet clique.
    According to Western news agencies, on the 6th, thousands of Buddhists in Hue poured into the streets with small family altar tables, blocking all major streets. Many monks and nuns stood silently beside the altar tables to protest the Saigon puppet authorities' order declaring all anti-US-puppet demonstrations in the Hue area illegal. On the 7th, the scale of the demonstrations increased. The main streets, squares, and roads were filled with altar tables, and this form of protest also spread to the nearby countryside and Da Nang City. Traffic in Hue was paralyzed. At the same time, all shops and vendors in Hue went on strike, and schools also boycotted classes. The Buddhist radio station located in the Dieu De Pagoda in Hue condemned the United States for supporting the Nguyen Cao Ky clique in suppressing Buddhists in its broadcast on the evening of the 7th.
    The radio station also called on puppet army soldiers who believe in Buddhism not to cooperate with the Nguyen Cao Ky regime to persecute Buddhists.

    南越佛教徒反美示威扩展到城乡各地
    顺化市商店摊贩学生罢市罢课声援佛教徒
    据新华社八日讯　西贡消息：顺化和西贡等地的佛教徒和群众近两天来，继续举行示威和集会，反对美伪集团。
    据西方通讯社报道，六日，数以千计的顺化市佛教徒带着家庭祭坛小桌涌上大街示威，各主要街道都被祭坛小桌堵住了。许多和尚和尼姑默默地站在祭坛小桌旁表示抗议，抗议西贡傀儡当局下令宣布顺化地区的一切反美伪集团的示威为非法。七日，示威的规模更大了。主要街道上、广场上、公路上都摆满了祭坛小桌，同时这种抗议方式还扩展到附近农村和岘港市。顺化市内交通陷于瘫痪。同时，顺化市所有的商店、摊贩都罢市了，学校也罢课了。设置在顺化市妙蒂寺内的佛教徒电台在七日晚的广播中，谴责美国支持阮高其集团镇压佛教徒。
    电台还号召信仰佛教的伪军士兵们不要同阮高其政权合作来迫害佛教徒。
