    The "Opinions on Offering Idealist Courses," drafted by a certain person in 1961, required that idealist courses should be "studied first, then criticized." The report stipulated that teachers' lectures should "first provide a more comprehensive and accurate introduction," while whether to conduct criticism "should be determined based on the teacher's qualifications and willingness." "Students should diligently study on their own after class and conduct academic discussions." There was absolutely no mention of criticism.

    Subsequently, Lu Ping personally stepped forward to mobilize a certain "authority" from the Vienna School to lecture on "Logical Positivism." The aforementioned person said that he was not good at criticism and dared not lecture. Lu Ping encouraged him, saying, "It doesn't matter, just lecture, lecturing is serving socialism." What a "serving socialism"! Under this banner, the bourgeois black goods of Kant, Hegel, Keynes, Neo-Thomism, etc., were all released and clamored for a time.

    The Lu Ping black gang also proposed that "experienced teachers should be on the front line of teaching" (referring to basic course teaching), and teachers of specialized courses should "form a complete set" and "give full play to the expertise of veteran teachers," allowing all the bourgeois "authorities," large and small, to occupy important lecture platforms.

    What kind of "set" did they assemble, and what kind of "dragon" did they form?

    Look at the Chinese literature major. The main lecturers included feudal remnants, "talented scholar" young masters, escaped right-wing elements, profit-seeking frivolous literati, and bourgeois scholars peddling revisionist private goods. Those who controlled some of the "high, precise, and cutting-edge" courses in the history department were either escaped right-wing elements, revisionists, or characters with rogue tendencies.

    These "authorities" spread poison wantonly in the classroom, and some even shot poisonous arrows at the Party and the people. For example, a certain person who lectured on "Latin American History" praised the "progressiveness" of the reactionary "Monroe Doctrine," openly defending the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the world's people. Some people openly attacked and slandered the great communist fighter Lei Feng, saying things like "Learning from Lei Feng is not as good as learning from Shen Yuan (an extreme rightist)," "The struggle between the socialist camp and the capitalist camp is dog eat dog," and so on. The Lu Ping black gang actually regarded these counter-revolutionary fallacies as "serving socialism"!

    Lu Ping felt it was not enough to let the bourgeois "authorities" within the university spread poison, so he also specially invited some bourgeois stinking "authorities" from outside the university to poison young people doubly. For example, those invited to the classical literature major, in addition to Wu Han, a vanguard of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, also included major rightists, traitorous literati, and veteran reactionary literati.

### 北大成了资产阶级“权威”贩毒的市场

    北大成了资产阶级“权威”贩毒的市场
    一九六一年某某人起草的《关于开设唯心主义课程的意见》，对唯心主义课程，要求“首先要学习，然后才批判”。在报告中，对教师的讲课，首先要求“作比较全面、如实的介绍”，至于是否进行批判，“则须根据教师的条件与自愿来确定”。“学生在课后应当认真自学，开展学术讨论”。就是绝口不提批判。
    接着，陆平亲自出马，动员维也纳派“权威”某某出来讲《逻辑实证主义》。某某说自己批判不好，不敢讲。陆平给他打气说：“不要紧，讲出来就好，讲出来就是为社会主义服务。”好一个“为社会主义服务”！就是在这个招牌下，康德、黑格尔、凯恩斯、新托马斯主义等等资产阶级黑货，纷纷出笼，喧嚣一时。
    陆平黑帮还提出，要“有经验的教师上教学第一线”（指基础课教学），专门课的教师要“配套成龙”，“发挥老教师专长”，让大大小小的资产阶级“权威”全部霸占重要讲台。
    他们配的什么“套”，成了什么“龙”呢？
    请看中国文学专业，主讲人有封建遗老，有“才子派”大少爷，有漏网右派分子，有利欲熏心的无聊文人，有贩卖修正主义私货的资产阶级学者。掌握历史系一些“高精尖”课的，不是漏网右派分子，就是修正主义者或者流氓成性的人物。
    这些“权威”在课堂上大肆放毒，有的还向党向人民射出一支支毒箭。例如主讲《拉美史》的某某人，大肆吹捧反动的“门罗主义”的“进步性”，公然为世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义的侵略罪行辩护。有的人公开攻击和诬蔑伟大的共产主义战士雷锋，说什么“学习雷锋，不如学习沈元（极右分子）”，“社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营的斗争是狗咬狗”，等等。陆平黑帮竟把这些反革命谬论看作是“为社会主义服务”！
    陆平让校内的资产阶级“权威”放毒还嫌不够，还要从校外特邀一些资产阶级臭“权威”来加倍毒害青年。如古典文献专业请来的，除“三家村”黑店急先锋吴晗外，还有大右派，有汉奸文人，有老牌反动文人。
