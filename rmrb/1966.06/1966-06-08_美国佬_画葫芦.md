    The American "Drawing a Gourd"
    Tian Ma Poem  Bullets whiz, Americans fall into graves with each shot, frightened and looking around: Where are the sharpshooters!?  Endless suffering, impossible to defend against, worrying about bullets flying and losing their lives!  Smart people aren't "confused," they imitate:  Studying the Viet Cong's guerrilla warfare textbook, they also establish "sniper teams."  Cleverness leads to foolishness, resulting in total failure.
	Who do the "sniper teams" snipe?  No target to be found!  Aim at the sky?  Aim at the trees?  Aim at the rocks?  Aim at the roads?  The South Vietnamese Liberation Army appears and disappears unpredictably, leaving no trace!  Drawing a gourd in vain, unable to solve worries and suffering; the people's war is an impregnable fortress, destined to crush you to pieces! (Attached picture)

    美国佬“画葫芦”
    天马诗  苗地画子弹呼呼呼，美国佬一枪一个进坟墓，心惊胆战来四顾：神枪手在何处！？苦呀苦呀说不尽的苦，要防防不住，担心枪子会飞来，一命就呜呼！聪明人不“糊涂”，来一个依样画葫芦：学习越共游击战术教科书，也成立“狙击小组”。聪明反被聪明误，落得个满盘都是输，
  “狙击小组”狙击谁？目标找不住！瞄天空？瞄大树？瞄石头？瞄大路？南越解放军神出鬼没，一点儿踪迹全无！空自画葫芦，难解愁和苦；人民战争是铜墙铁壁，管叫你粉身碎骨！（附图片）
