Manuvila Reads the Report of the Secretary-General of the Standing Bureau at the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers

Dear colleagues:

First, let me extend a warm and fraternal welcome to all of you, representatives from various countries of Asia and Africa who have been invited to participate in this emergency meeting of Asian and African writers. We are convening this emergency meeting mainly to fulfill our duty as Asian and African writers, especially progressive Asian and African writers, which is to resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people in their life-and-death struggle against American imperialism to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country.

At the same time, please allow me to express my deepest gratitude on behalf of the Standing Bureau to the Chinese Writers' Association for providing all the conveniences for this meeting to be held in the famous capital of the great nation of the People's Republic of China, which is at the forefront of the world revolution under the banner of Mao Zedong.

The glorious victories of the Vietnamese people in their struggle prove that American imperialism can be defeated

Dear colleagues:

Today, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggressors has become the focus of attention of the anti-imperialist people and forces in the world, especially in Asia and Africa. American imperialism brazenly violated the Geneva Agreement, completely disregarding the condemnation of the world, and completely disregarding sovereignty and independence. This not only aroused the hatred and indignation of the Vietnamese people but also aroused the hatred and indignation of the people of the world who love liberation, freedom, and peace.

Facing a desperate situation, facing a nation determined to fight until their land is liberated, American imperialism blindly escalated the war of aggression in South Vietnam. They have already deployed more than 275,000 troops of aggression and, together with their lackeys from the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the Park Chung-hee clique, are providing more cannon fodder or accelerating and strengthening their material cooperation with their aggression. American imperialism uses B-52 type aircraft to indiscriminately bomb schools, hospitals, homes, and religious sites, slaughtering innocent men, women, and children. They are also using poison gas and high-concentration chemical poisons on an unprecedented scale to slaughter people, destroy crops, livestock, and poultry. They have committed the most heinous crimes, the extreme cruelty of which is unparalleled in human history. American imperialism intends to plunge South Vietnam into a sea of blood with its "kill all, burn all, destroy all" policy. In addition, it has established so-called "strategic villages," which are nothing but concentration camps, imprisoning millions of innocent people.

This new, ineffective, and escalating war to subjugate the Vietnamese people, on the one hand, further proves that American imperialism is the number one enemy of the progressive and peace-loving people of the world. On the other hand, it exposes that American imperialism is already in its death throes in South Vietnam. This proves that the U.S. is trying to use all its strength to reverse its unfavorable situation in South Vietnam, while also showing that the Vietnamese people's determination to resist American aggressors is becoming stronger and stronger. This proves that American imperialism will not change its aggressive nature until it is completely defeated; at the same time, it also proves that in the struggle for freedom, the decisive factor is people, not weapons. The more American imperialism escalates the war, the closer it gets to its end in Vietnam; the more American imperialism escalates the war, the more glorious the victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people. No matter how barbaric the atrocities, they cannot weaken the iron will of the South Vietnamese people to fight to the final victory.

The South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the people are fighting with unparalleled bravery. They are defeating and annihilating the American aggressors everywhere in South Vietnam, in cities and jungles, in suburbs and villages. For the heroic Vietnamese people, South Vietnam is a battlefield everywhere. The aggressors are under attack from all sides; their airfields, camps, and barracks are being destroyed, and tens of thousands of bandit troops are being annihilated. The so-called strategic villages have been destroyed and turned into fighting villages. The lair of the American imperialists and their puppet clique in Saigon is today successfully within the "range" of the guerrillas. In various parts of South Vietnam, American aggressors, puppet troops, and mercenaries are being annihilated by the thousands every day.

Dear colleagues:

What do the glorious victories achieved by the heroic South Vietnamese people tell us? What lessons do they give to the world? The unprecedented victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people prove to the world that American imperialism is not invincible. Vietnam has clearly shown that the bows and arrows, machetes, and bamboo stakes in the hands of the revolutionary people who love freedom are much more powerful than the bombs, bullets, and missiles of the imperialists. Vietnam has already fully told us that the weapons and armies of any imperialist can never surround and shake the great fortress of the people fighting for national liberation. Vietnam has undoubtedly proven to the world that all the arrogant attempts of imperialists to enslave and exploit people will eventually suffer a miserable defeat. Vietnam has completely torn off the mask of American imperialism and exposed its true, malicious nature to the world. Vietnam has proven that American imperialism is nothing more than a disintegrating, dying force, rapidly heading towards death. In Vietnam, we have seen that armed struggle is the only way to deal with all imperialists and old and new colonialists led by the United States. Although American imperialism is making a desperate struggle in South Vietnam, it is still trying to cling to South Vietnam to the last moment. Just recently, the Johnson administration has begun to withdraw more troops from Western Europe to strengthen its military deployment in South Vietnam and expand the war of aggression against South Vietnam. We know that the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Western Europe to South Vietnam is done with the tacit agreement of a certain so-called socialist power in Europe, so that American imperialism can continue its aggression with impunity. But this also logically proves that American imperialism is already feeling a serious shortage of troops in its aggression against Vietnam. This also powerfully proves that the patriotic armed forces, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam, are rapidly annihilating the American aggressors; American imperialism is already at its wits' end in South Vietnam.

American imperialists, in their desperate struggle, have escalated their aggression to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and even threatened China. They are madly bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, blatantly invading its territory, and brazenly provoking it. American imperialism has launched a despicable and barbaric aggression against the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to intimidate them and force them to surrender. It hopes to weaken the fighting power of the heroic people of North Vietnam. But the brave people of North Vietnam, tempered in the struggle, have given the aggressors a heavy blow, telling them a universal truth: no matter what weapons they use, they or any other brand of imperialists cannot intimidate or conquer revolutionary people. We fully support all measures taken by the people of North Vietnam to defend their sovereignty and independence. Recently, American aggressors' planes invaded Chinese airspace and shot down a Chinese plane that was on a training flight, which clearly shows that the U.S. war in Vietnam is spreading to other countries. We strongly condemn this brazen provocation by American imperialism against the People's Republic of China. We fully support the firm stance of the heroic Chinese people to defend their territorial integrity and safeguard their great socialist country.

Pseudo-revolutionaries peddle the U.S. peace scam, betray the Vietnamese people, and attempt to realize the conspiracy of the two superpowers to dominate the world

The Johnson administration is playing all kinds of tricks to deceive the Vietnamese people, hoping to extricate itself from the predicament in South Vietnam and the deepening quagmire. Johnson, while increasing troops to South Vietnam, madly bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and expanding his aggression to other countries, is also talking about "peace negotiations," "unconditional discussions," and "social reforms" to cover up his war preparations and try to quell the anger of the South Vietnamese people, making them lay down their arms. But the South Vietnamese people know, and the world knows, that behind this cunning trick lies the aggressive face of American imperialism and its sinister purpose of trying to get from the negotiating table what it cannot get on the battlefield. The Vietnamese people know, and the world knows, that "peace negotiations" with the aggressors will not bring the true peace they yearn for. The Vietnamese people know, and the world knows, that "unconditional discussions" will only make them unconditionally surrender to the aggressors. What discussion can there be with murderers? What negotiation can there be with robbers who have robbed their country?

History is full of conspicuous examples that prove this indisputable truth: only through revolutionary struggle, only by defeating and annihilating the aggressors, can freedom and peace be won. The Vietnamese people must take the path that all oppressed nations and peoples have taken in the past to win their freedom. Johnson's obvious scams will be thrown into the dustbin of history and will be despised as they deserve. We Asian and African writers resolutely support the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. American imperialism must immediately stop its aggression against the whole of Vietnam, withdraw all its troops of aggression from South Vietnam, recognize the National Liberation Front as the sole representative of the South Vietnamese people, and let the Vietnamese people solve the Vietnamese problem themselves.

Dear colleagues:

When American imperialism not only arouses the hatred and indignation of the South Vietnamese people but also arouses the hatred and indignation of all the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the world, when it is on the brink of death, some people come out to save it. These so-called revolutionaries are today the greatest defenders of American imperialism. They are today the main allies of American imperialism. They collude with the conspiracies and actions of American imperialism to dominate the world. They have completely surrendered to American imperialism, thus betraying the national liberation struggle of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are more dangerous than the American imperialists because they are wolves in sheep's clothing. They pretend to support the Vietnamese people but collude with the American imperialists, plot and scheme, and sabotage the struggle of the Vietnamese people. They shout support for the Vietnamese people to liberate South Vietnam and defend the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but they peddle the worn-out "peace" scam of the American imperialists around the world, forcing the Vietnamese people to surrender to the aggressors. However, when peddling the "peace" scam around the world, these pseudo-revolutionaries are as incompetent as third-rate brokers, no, fourth-rate brokers, and after being driven away, they return home with this batch of goods. But these political brokers who are trading with the fate of the Asian and African peoples are not willing to accept their failure and continue to peddle their filthy goods. They recently proposed, in a roundabout way, what they call the five "preconditions" for "peace negotiations" to solve the Vietnamese problem; they call the sole legal representative of the South Vietnamese people, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, a "negotiating partner"; they respond to Johnson's call for "phased withdrawal" of troops with "beginning to withdraw" and "stopping the increase," but in reality, they are only talking and not withdrawing; they are also trying to permanently divide Vietnam under the pretext of "internal affairs" and "self-determination" in South Vietnam, obstructing the Vietnamese people from reunifying their country. The shameless betrayal of these traitors towards the just and heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people fully exposes their degenerate, despicable, and vile nature and the line of capitulation they are pursuing. These pseudo-revolutionaries attempt to peddle the "peace" scam of American imperialism, actually attempting to betray the South Vietnamese people and realize the conspiracy of the two superpowers to dominate the world. All their so-called sincere suggestions to solve the Vietnamese problem show that they are completely colluding with American imperialism, making it continue to suppress the South Vietnamese people. No matter how much they propagate capitulationism, no matter how much they try to whitewash American imperialism, the Vietnamese people who have chosen the revolutionary path and all the peoples of the world will not be deceived by these traitors. The Vietnamese people believe, and all the revolutionary and progressive peoples of the world believe, that victory is definitely theirs. We Asian and African writers strongly condemn the evil conspiracies of these traitors and call on the Asian and African peoples and writers to unite in condemning and attacking them.

The current international situation is one of great changes. The revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will definitely crush American imperialism to smithereens

Dear colleagues:

We are gathered here today, facing the greatest changes in the current international situation. In this process of change, we see a surging tide rapidly developing in the world, especially in Asia and Africa, more rapidly than ever before. The characteristic of this tide is the high, intense, and more intense than ever before struggle against the forces of American-led imperialism and its lackeys. This is a struggle between two different forces, revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces; this is a struggle of billions of people fighting for liberation and advancing towards victory, while American-led imperialism and its puppets are heading towards death. In world history, American imperialism has never been as isolated as it is today. In world history, American imperialism has never suffered such heavy defeats as it does today. In world history, American imperialism has never been as weak as it is today. The political awareness and revolutionary spirit of the peoples, especially the peoples of Asia and Africa, have greatly increased. They have already taken up arms to fight decisively against the imperialists led by the United States and their lackeys, who have oppressed them for decades. Now is the time when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. American imperialism and its lackeys have no power to extinguish the blazing revolutionary flames that have swept across the world, especially across Asia and Africa. The powerful storm of people's struggles sweeping across the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will smash American imperialism against the rocks and reduce it to smithereens. American imperialism, through its counter-revolutionary global strategy policy, commits evil aggression against the people, thus paving the way for its own demise.

Therefore, we see that the situation of revolutionary and progressive movements in the world is entering a new stage. In many countries of the world, the people have risen up to fight decisively against American imperialism and its lackeys and puppets. They are engaged in a decisive struggle for national independence and peace or to defend the independence they have already won.

The people of Cambodia have set an example of resolute struggle against the conspiracies of American imperialism, with the help of its lackeys in Bangkok and Saigon, to sabotage the sovereignty and neutrality of the Cambodian people. The American imperialists, with the connivance of their lackeys, almost every day invade the borders of this peaceful country, which is no secret. They are blatantly violating this country's airspace and threatening the lives of its people.

Recently, the American imperialists, in order to find an excuse to justify their provocative measures to attack Cambodia, falsely accused Cambodia of harboring foreign troops. The Cambodian people not only refuted this fabrication but also demanded that the American imperialists provide evidence for their accusations. We fully support the resolute struggle of the patriotic people of Cambodia to resist the vicious attacks of American aggressors and their spies and to defend their national independence, territorial integrity, neutrality, and peace.

In Laos, the patriotic forces and people of Laos are bravely fighting against the attempts of American imperialists to infiltrate their territory and sabotage the national liberation movement. American imperialists, using their lackeys, the Thai army, invade the territory of Laos and, together with the right-wing army of Laos, attack the patriotic armed forces and the people of Laos.

In the past two years, various types of American aircraft have madly bombed the liberated areas of Laos. In the past two years, the attempts of American imperialism and its lackeys to force the Laotian people to abandon their inalienable rights as a free nation have failed. Their future attempts to conquer the Laotian people will also fail.

American imperialists are using the Thai army to invade South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and even in Thailand, they are facing greater difficulties. The Thai people, united around the Thai Patriotic Front, are fighting against American imperialism and the local puppet regime to achieve true freedom, peace, and progress.

In South Korea, the fascist military regime propped up by American imperialism with the help of its lackeys is beginning to totter under the fierce blows of the patriotic people of South Korea. In the past twenty years, American imperialism has been obstructing the unification of Korea and brutally suppressing the Korean people. The evil "Korean-Japanese Treaty" of American imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique is not only to maintain its brutal rule in South Korea but also to continue its policy of aggression. American imperialism is now desperately trying to realize the so-called "Northeast Asian Military Alliance" to save its failures in South Korea and other regions of Asia where it is conducting aggression.

No matter what means American imperialism uses, it cannot continue to suppress the Korean people, it can no longer obstruct the Korean people from unifying their country. Its days of unwelcome and illegal stay in South Korea are definitely numbered.

In Japan, the resolute struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and its faithful lackey, the reactionary Sato government, is growing stronger. Everyone knows that the United States has about two hundred military bases in Japan, which are the main tools for American imperialism to carry out its aggressive strategy in Asia. More importantly, American imperialism has turned the Okinawa Islands into a giant nuclear base and is fully using this base to wage aggression against the Vietnamese people, although this group of islands is Japanese territory and is inhabited by Japanese people. Therefore, the struggle of the Japanese people, including the residents of Okinawa, to return Okinawa to Japan is not only to enable the Japanese government to resume the administration of affairs but also to drive out the American army from there and eliminate all military bases. We believe that the Japanese people must recover their legitimate territory of the Okinawa Islands.

One of the most important purposes of the struggle of the Japanese people is to abolish the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." This treaty is not only the core of American military, political, economic, and cultural domination of Japan but also the core of the aggressive alliance between American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. Therefore, it is only natural that the Japanese people who yearn for true independence and peace must fight mercilessly against the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the "Northeast Asian Treaty Organization" axis "Korean-Japanese Treaty," and the conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and economic expansion.

Under the great pressure of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary ruling clique, the heroic Japanese people are determined to gain peace, independence, and progress at any cost, to become true friends of the Asian and African peoples.

The struggle of the Pakistani people to maintain national independence and defend their country from the aggressive adventures of certain people is a just and sacred struggle. The patriotic Pakistani people have a tradition of struggle against imperialism and colonialism and will not allow American imperialism or its lackeys to destroy their independence and sovereignty. The patriotic Pakistani people know who their friends are and who their enemies are, so they will not sacrifice their hard-won freedom due to the threats and coercion of American imperialism or any of its lackeys and defenders.

The people of Kashmir are approaching the completion of self-determination, taking a firm stand against the conspiracies actively supported by American imperialism and pseudo-revolutionaries to allow those with no right to usurp their territory. These people and the reactionary neighbors of Kashmir, shamelessly violating the United Agreement, have been continuously invading the peaceful people of Kashmir and depriving them of the right to choose their own fate. This act of aggression is fully supported and unreservedly supported by American imperialism and its accomplices. These accomplices openly assist the reactionary expansionists in extinguishing the liberation movement of the Kashmiri people. But the day when the Kashmiri people will use their undeniable right to decide their own future is not far off.

The Indian people are suffering from great hardships, and they are launching a large-scale struggle against hunger and oppression across the country, despite the brutal suppression of the Indian authorities. This struggle has received the sympathy and support of the progressive peoples of Asia and Africa.

Recently, the anti-American movement in the Philippines has also intensified, and the progressive, national-conscious Filipino people are strongly opposing the influence of the United States on their country.

In Malaya, due to the unyielding struggle of the Malayan National Liberation Army, the Malayan people have bravely repulsed the concentrated attacks launched by the British army, which is supported by the United States and has many times the number of soldiers, jet aircraft, bombers, tanks, and other modern killing weapons. Therefore, the British imperialists have been forced to repeatedly admit that their armed suppression has failed. To maintain their shaky colonial rule, they have used new political schemes outside of military operations. Thus, the puppet clique of Abdul Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew appeared, and in the past nine years, they have plotted one new colonialist conspiracy after another—the so-called independence of the Malayan Federation, the so-called autonomous status of Singapore, the creation of the so-called "Malaysia" with the support of the United States and the United Nations controlled by the United States and their defenders, the separation of Singapore from this new colonialist plan "Malaysia," and finally the so-called "granting" of independence to their tame lackey, the Lee Kuan Yew clique.

These "constitutional" tricks of the British, no matter how cunningly disguised, are their desperate struggles to maintain colonial rule while serving their "Suez east" policy in the global strategy of the United States. The progressive public opinion of the world has strongly condemned these traitorous acts of the pseudo-revolutionaries, who are eager to help the British imperialists support the isolated puppet regime of Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore on the international stage. Like the military coup of the Indonesian reactionaries, the recognition of the fake independence of Singapore by the Jakarta fascist regime and the Manila talks between Malik and Razak are all directed by American and British imperialism and are important parts of their conspiracy to suppress the national liberation movements of Malaya (including Singapore), North Borneo, Indonesia, and other Southeast Asian countries.

The Malayan people have completely seen through these conspiracies of imperialism and pseudo-revolutionaries and are strengthening their struggles in all fields to eliminate American-led imperialism and their accomplices. The movement of the Malayan people—to smash "Malaysia," overthrow the puppet regimes in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, and achieve a truly independent Malaya that includes Singapore—is entering a new high tide and will undoubtedly achieve victory.

Despite the brutal, continuous suppression of the British imperialists and their lackeys Abdul Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew, the people of North Borneo are continuing their armed struggle for complete national independence and against the new colonialist plan "Malaysia." Despite the treacherous actions of the Nasution-Suharto military dictatorship, the people of North Borneo are continuing to strike at the British imperialists and their "Malaysia" lackeys. The Asian and African writers will forever support the struggle of the people of North Borneo for true national independence.

The peoples of the Middle Eastern countries, in order to defend their national independence, have launched a struggle against imperialism. They have united to liberate the occupied Palestinian territories, which are known as Israel—the obedient tool of American imperialism and Zionism. We know that Israel is a creation of the United States, used as a base for its aggression against independent Arab countries and infiltration into African countries. The Palestinian Arabs, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, are determined to defeat the conspiracies of American imperialism and Zionism and reclaim their occupied homeland. The Palestinian people, in their struggle to return home, have received the unreserved support and solidarity of all the peoples of Asia and Africa.

Although American imperialism intends to turn its lackey Israel into a base for nuclear weapons and other types of weapons to invade Arab countries, we believe that their sinister ambitions will not be realized. The Arab peoples, tempered in the anti-imperialist struggle, will not allow imperialists to destroy and overthrow their independence. No force of American imperialism can stop the struggle of the Arab peoples to defend their national independence. No force of American imperialism can stop the Palestinian Arabs from reclaiming their homeland.

The Asian and African peoples' opposition to the "Islamic Treaty" once again proves that the people will not be deceived by the American imperialists. The Asian and African peoples have recognized the danger of this treaty of aggression planned by the American imperialists and their henchmen. It is a treaty that divides rather than unites the Asian and African peoples. Through this treaty, the American imperialists and their lackeys attempt to misuse religion to sow discord among religious believers, create disputes among them, and sabotage their progress. The American imperialists' attempt to use religion to realize their ambitions and oppress the people is doomed to fail.

In South Yemen, Aden, and Oman, the people's struggle for independence has put the imperialist and colonialist forces led by the United States in a very difficult position.

American imperialism will never be able to isolate China. China's friends are all over the world. China's possession of nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

Facing the surging anti-American tide sweeping across Asia, American imperialism has resorted to another trick to save its doom. It has begun to shift its global strategy to the east, attempting to launch a large-scale aggression in Asia. This vicious act of American imperialism is undoubtedly aimed at carrying out its policy of "containing China" first. The Johnson administration itself has revealed that in the new U.S. military aid program, more military aid will be provided to South Vietnam, Thailand, the Park Chung-hee clique, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and other puppets. This is mainly to strengthen the military base encirclement that has already been formed against China, attempting to isolate China. Here, it must be pointed out that a leadership group of a socialist country has completely degenerated into a lackey of American imperialism, busy building bricks and carrying soil to strengthen this encirclement and isolate China. The seven hundred million Chinese people have sworn to be fully prepared to deal with American imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices at any time and in any place. American imperialism will never be able to isolate China. China is a country that is becoming stronger and stronger, and around it, more and more revolutionary and progressive peoples are uniting. China's friends are all over the world, and the so-called encirclement of China is actually a noose around the necks of American imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices, which will strangle them to death.

Recently, the explosion of China's third nuclear bomb has shattered the arrogant ambition of American imperialism and pseudo-revolutionaries to maintain nuclear monopoly and blackmail all revolutionary peoples. The nuclear weapons in the hands of China are the weapons in the hands of all revolutionary peoples fighting to liberate their countries. We believe that all peace-loving peoples of the world also believe that China's possession of nuclear weapons is completely for self-defense and to safeguard world peace. The nuclear weapons in the hands of China, for the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who have risen up against American imperialism, are a great encouragement. The nuclear weapons in the hands of China also create favorable conditions for all peoples of the world to completely ban and thoroughly destroy all nuclear weapons.

We firmly believe that the territory of Taiwan, which is currently being illegally occupied by the United States, will eventually return to its rightful owner.

The people of Africa have bravely stood up, and imperialism and colonialism must get out of Africa

On the African continent, the liberation movement of Africa is more acute, strong, and powerful than ever before. Today, the imperialists and colonialists led by the United States, in every place where they have long oppressed the African people, are facing more failures and setbacks than ever before. The African people's resistance to the unilateral declaration of independence by Ian Smith, plotted by the colonialists, shows that the imperialists and colonialists can deceive no one. The white supremacist regime of Smith in this country is facing the extreme hatred and indignation of the people because they have been deprived of the freedom to live in their own country in their own way. They have decided that the only way to achieve true independence is through armed struggle, and in this struggle, they have received the full support of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

In Azania (South Africa), the revolutionary movement against the fascist policies of the Vorster regime, under the correct leadership of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, has grown stronger. Vorster, the number one agent of imperialism and the most brutal suppressor of the rights of the South African people, is facing a resolute counterattack in the struggle of the people to establish a democratic and independent Azania.

The armed struggle of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people is developing deeply, and they are bravely fighting under the revolutionary banner of Patrice Lumumba to smash the cunning conspiracies of American imperialism and its accomplices.

The armed struggle launched by the peoples of "Portuguese" Guinea, Mozambique, and Angola against the imperialists and colonialists led by the United States is receiving the support and sympathy of all progressive peoples of the world. Their struggle has dealt another heavy blow to their common enemy.

The peoples of Guinea, Mali, Tanzania, and Congo (Brazzaville) have repeatedly repelled the subversive conspiracies of the imperialists and are defending their independence and hard-won revolutionary achievements.

In Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Swaziland, South West Africa, French Somaliland, Equatorial Guinea, and the Canary Islands, the people are more vigilant against the tricks of the imperialists supported by American imperialism to force them to give up their struggle for liberation and peace. The peoples of these countries believe that those who oppress them and bully them will not voluntarily give them true independence, and they are determined to wage a revolutionary struggle until they liberate their countries.

The imperialists and colonialists have almost reached the end of the road in oppressing the African people and plundering the wealth of their countries. The people of this continent, who have been enslaved for decades, have bravely stood up, overthrowing the rule of imperialism and colonialism, and fighting for freedom and peace. Isn't this proven by the fact that the number of independent countries in Africa has increased from four to thirty-six since 1955? Isn't this proof that Africa has awakened and is moving towards its goal? Indeed, Africa should and must belong to the Africans, and the imperialists and colonialists should and must get out of Africa. If they do not leave, they will be kicked out of Africa. Today, the revolutionary and freedom-loving Africans are doing just that.

The resistance of the Latin American peoples against American imperialism is becoming stronger, and the days of American imperialism and its lackeys are numbered

In Latin America, the evil aggression of American imperialism has strengthened the resistance of the Latin American peoples. The open, shameless suppression of American imperialism of the Dominican people's will for freedom and independence has exposed its true nature. American imperialism, in order to deceive and cheat the people and continue its military occupation of the Dominican Republic, recently staged a fake presidential election and installed one of its faithful lackeys as the ruler. However, the Dominican people immediately strongly protested this American-staged election, which shows that the patriotic people of the Dominican Republic are not willing to submit to American imperialism. The collapse of the anti-national military regime of Ecuador undoubtedly proves that the days of American imperialism or its lackeys continuing to suppress the people are numbered. Today, we see in the peoples of Latin America their growing hatred of American imperialism and their increasingly high revolutionary spirit to strike back and become masters of their own destiny. They have taken up arms and shaken the roots of American imperialism on their soil. American imperialism is so desperate to save itself in Latin America that it is running madly everywhere, trying to form a pan-American invasion force to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and sabotage their national aspirations. But the peoples of Latin America will not allow American imperialism to continue to exploit them and plunder the resources of this continent forever.

No matter how American imperialism tries to sabotage the liberation movement of Latin America, whether it is organizing invasion forces or economic blackmail, they are all doomed to fail. Many countries in Latin America have already taken up arms, and they will only lay down their arms when there is no more American aggression in their countries.

American imperialism is on the decline and is approaching its end, which is a fact. However, American imperialism, with the nature of all imperialist countries, will not perish by itself, which is also a fact. It will not accept its fate, it will not accept the fate that all previous imperialists have suffered, until it makes its last desperate struggle. Therefore, we see that American imperialism, in its dying moments, is still desperately defending its shrinking power in various parts of the world. It is desperately plotting or trying to plot one coup after another, propping up some puppets to serve its purposes.

We strongly condemn the barbaric crimes of the Indonesian fascist military regime and resolutely support the revolutionary forces of Indonesia

In Indonesia, American imperialism and its agent, the Central Intelligence Agency, after long-term subversive activities and coup plots, finally carried out a fascist military regime led by the right-wing generals Nasution and Suharto. This fascist military regime is rampant, carrying out a reign of terror, suppressing and persecuting the Indonesian people, and destroying their revolutionary achievements and fruits.

The high revolutionary tide of Indonesia has frightened and enraged the reactionary right-wing generals led by Nasution and Suharto, and they, together with American imperialism and its agent, the Central Intelligence Agency, conspired to seize power. In the "September 30th Incident," patriotic officers took correct action to stop the evil intentions of the reactionary generals, and the right-wing forces in the army used this incident as an excuse to carry out a brutal massacre, large-scale arrests, torture, and persecution of progressive people in Indonesia, especially communists, progressive nationalists, and patriotic religious figures, venting their hatred for the people and the people's revolution and achievements. This reign of terror, which coincided with the vicious and bloody anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese people's racist movement, was not accidental. It served the global strategy of the United States against China, the so-called "containment of China" policy.

So far, more than three hundred thousand Indonesian patriots have been brutally slaughtered, and many more are still being tortured in prisons and concentration camps, just because they love their country and defend the revolution of Indonesia. All progressive organizations in Indonesia have been disbanded. Many writers and artists associated with these organizations have been imprisoned and persecuted. Many Indonesian writers who helped us establish this organization are now missing.

We know that Indonesia once stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle and resolutely supported the liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We all saw the great revolutionary upsurge in Indonesian literature, art, and culture before the "October Incident" of 1965. At that time, the progressive writers and artists of Indonesia launched a revolutionary attack on the cultural infiltration and sabotage of American imperialism and the defenders of the so-called "universal humanism," establishing a people's culture that reflects their national characteristics.

However, today we see that the fascist military regime of Nasution and Suharto is pulling this country to the heels of American imperialism, making the revolution of this country retreat. This sinister intention is manifested in Indonesia's cessation of opposition to "Malaysia," this new colonialist product, which was established with the active support of American imperialism by British colonialists to suppress the national liberation struggle of the people of Malaya (including Singapore) and North Borneo and to sabotage the independence and sovereignty of Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. Recently, the United States, the Japanese Sato government, and other countries that collude with imperialism are so willing to provide "aid" to Indonesia, which clearly shows that the fascist military dictatorship of Nasution and Suharto is leading this country to where.

We strongly condemn the barbaric crimes of the fascist military regime of Nasution and Suharto against the Indonesian people and express our resolute support for the revolutionary forces of Indonesia. These fascist atrocities do not show that the lackeys of American imperialism in Indonesia are strong. On the contrary, this only proves their extreme weakness and their rapid approach to death.

The dark clouds that currently appear over Indonesia are only a temporary phenomenon. Today, the Indonesian people, faithful to their revolutionary traditions and struggles, are reorganizing themselves and rising up against the fascist regime of Nasution and Suharto. The writers of Indonesia are standing up with their people.

We firmly believe that the resistance movement of the patriotic people of Indonesia, armed with past revolutionary experience and tempered in the current severe test of the storm, will grow and strengthen. The evil night will soon turn into the bright day of victory.

The coup by the right-wing in Ghana has completely exposed the treacherous conspiracy of American-led imperialism and colonialism to recolonize the young independent countries of Africa. This conspiracy, plotted and executed by American and British imperialism with the help of their local lackeys, exposes the new cunning tricks of imperialism to oppose independent African countries and sabotage African unity. This is an attempt by imperialism to stop the high tide of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist movements on the African continent.

Since Ghana gained independence, due to its anti-imperialist stance, it has become a thorn in the eyes of imperialism, colonialism, and their lackeys. The coup against Ghana is a shameful conspiracy of American-led imperialism and colonialism to overthrow the African government that maintains sovereignty and independence with the help of their local lackeys.

In recent years, the liberation movement in Africa has been surging, and the African peoples have taken a firm anti-imperialist stance and implemented an independent policy. This has frightened imperialism, and it has been trying every means to block this tide, openly or secretly, to sabotage the wishes of the African peoples. This despicable act, plotted and executed by American imperialism and British colonialism with their lackeys, is a challenge to all African peoples and progressive peoples of the world. All countries or nations in Africa, Asia, or any other part of the world that love freedom and peace cannot but condemn this provocative attack carried out by imperialism and its lackeys. We know that the Ghanaian people are experiencing a test; we also know that the Ghanaian people will ultimately win victory.

The interference and subversive activities of American imperialism clearly show its wolfish ambition to oppress the people and keep the people under its feet. These activities show that imperialism and colonialism, before their final collapse, will use their last bit of strength to stir up a temporary backlash, attempting to save their death. However, contrary to the hopes of imperialism, its desperate counterattacks in some countries have only increased the vigilance and resistance of the people. This will only make the powerful anti-imperialist storm spread more quickly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is a historical fact and historical law that imperialism cannot escape. History has shown that all revolutionary movements have experienced ups and downs and successes and failures; history has proven that after every failure, the revolutionary movement will advance in big strides.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is a lackey of American imperialism, a traitor to the interests of the Asian and African peoples, playing a role that no imperialism and reactionaries of any country can play

When American imperialism is facing the opposition of the people of the world, including the people of the United States, who are striking at the heart of the American empire, when the mighty storm of the people's power is smashing it to pieces, we see today that the Soviet revisionist leadership is playing another dirty political trick. When the tottering house of American imperialism is about to collapse, these hypocritical revolutionaries come out to support and save it. They have become the most capable defenders of American imperialism. They collude with American imperialism and conspire to sabotage the national liberation struggles of many countries in the world. They have betrayed the revolutionary ideals and principles that are sacred and precious to all those who strive for liberation, peace, and democracy.

These so-called revolutionaries see only the weakened American imperialism as a "giant," they fear this "giant," and therefore compromise and collude with it. When the storm of opposition to it is brewing within American imperialism, when events like the Los Angeles uprising clearly prove that the revolution of the oppressed masses is surging, these so-called revolutionaries help American imperialism brutally suppress the struggle of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples for independence. While they are loudly proclaiming their support for the world revolutionary movement, they are day and night defending and finding excuses for American imperialism. They claim to be friends of the revolutionary movement and the oppressed peoples. But in fact, they are only lackeys of American imperialism, saboteurs of the national liberation movement, traitors to the interests of the Asian and African peoples. In fact, they act as the social pillars of international imperialism, playing the unseemly role of the special forces of imperialism to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. To realize the dream of jointly ruling the world with the United States, they repeatedly praise the imperialists as "wise men," "moderates," saying that "Johnson has obtained the absolute mandate of the people." They repeatedly advocate their cooperation with the United States, propagating that there is a "very broad field of cooperation" between the two countries. They have done many dirty political deals with American imperialism both inside and outside the United Nations. They repeatedly declare that colonialism can be eliminated through the United Nations and that independence can be "granted" to the oppressed peoples. In fact, they cooperate with American imperialism in the United Nations to suppress the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They conspire with American imperialism to extinguish the blazing revolutionary flames of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Didn't they conspire to send United Nations troops controlled by the United States to Congo and kill the great African hero Lumumba? Didn't they vote with the United States in the Security Council to support United Nations intervention in the Dominican Republic? Didn't they, ignoring the opposition of the peoples of African countries, vote with the United States in the Security Council to support the British, the backers of Smith, to "pacify" the situation in Southern Rhodesia and suppress the liberation struggle of the people of Zimbabwe? Didn't they eagerly advocate the establishment of a permanent United Nations force to jointly suppress the national liberation struggles with the United States? The facts are far from this. They have sat with the lackeys of American imperialism, the puppet regimes of South Vietnam, South Korea, Israel, "Malaysia," and the Chiang Kai-shek gang many times, conspiring to realize the plot of American imperialism to rule the Asian peoples. They are conspiring with American imperialism and its lackeys to invade the peaceful people of Kashmir. They are conspiring with American imperialism and its lackeys to obstruct the Palestinian people from reclaiming their homeland. What is particularly despicable and infuriating is that they blatantly collude with American imperialism and its lackeys to betray the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. Their acts of surrendering to the United States and befriending the enemy are ironclad evidence. Sometimes they also pretend to support the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, occasionally cursing the United States a few times, but this does not prove that they have changed at all. This only makes it clearer that they are so hypocritical, cunning, treacherous, and malicious, deceiving the people of the world to realize their conspiracy to cooperate with American imperialism to rule the world. The actions of these traitors can only fully expose that they are fake anti-imperialists, true capitulationists, fake revolutionaries, true betrayers, fake friends, and true splitters.

We are not surprised that these people have joined the ranks of imperialism, because we know that like attracts like. Here, I would like to quote a sentence from a revolutionary journalist: the American imperialists and these people used to shake hands in secret, but now they are kissing in public, and they feel no shame at all.

Today, the revolutionary peoples of the world are becoming more united, and they are uniting under the banner of opposition to imperialism and old and new colonialism. Unlike those who pretend to be friends of the peoples who are fighting, we strive for unity based on a firm and correct anti-imperialist line. We will unite with all anti-imperialist revolutionary forces and will not unite with those who collude with the United States and help the United States suppress and oppress the people. We will unite, truly unite, not fake unity. We tell those pseudo-revolutionaries that in the true, broad, and united anti-American united front, there is no place for them, because they have betrayed the people and the cause of the people. If this united front includes these lackeys of American imperialism, won't American imperialism itself be included? Won't the anti-American united front become a pro-American united front? This is absolutely impossible. We can only draw a clear line with them in all aspects, expose their evil conspiracies, and fight against them.

Let these traitors go and seek peace and compromise with American imperialism. But we cannot! We cannot seek peace and compromise with them, because we deeply know that American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

This century is the century of the people. No matter how powerful American-led imperialism appears to be, no matter what means it uses, it cannot defeat the people who strive for liberation. American imperialism has aroused the people and caused their revolutionary movements, making itself surrounded. American imperialism cannot escape the inevitable death that awaits it. When American imperialism dies, it will also be the day of doom for its lackeys and puppets. Those who surrender to American imperialism and its lackeys and puppets and conspire with them to betray the people will also perish with them.

The fighting and progressive writers of Asia and Africa must throw themselves into the fiery struggle of the people, actively participate in the current struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys and defenders

Dear colleagues:

Today, we Asian and African progressive writers are gathered here mainly to support and voice our support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate their homeland, and at the same time, to support the struggle of the Asian and African peoples to defend and maintain national independence.

As writers dedicated to the revolutionary cause of the two continents, our responsibility and task is to turn our pens into powerful weapons. All dark forces that harm the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles that drive the Asian and African peoples forward must be praised. This is the sacred task that falls on the shoulders of us Asian and African progressive writers. For the common just cause of the Asian and African peoples, we should use our pens to severely criticize and expose the common enemy of the Asian and African peoples—the American imperialists and their lackeys, as well as the treacherous faces of those cunning pseudo-revolutionaries, so that the Asian and African people can see clearly who their enemies are and who their friends are. At the same time, we have the responsibility to let the world know the true situation of the struggles of the Asian and African peoples, to take up our pens to sing the heroic and magnificent spirit of the peoples of various Asian and African countries, and to inspire their anti-imperialist will.

Progressive and revolutionary writers always fuse their lives with the lives of the people, sharing their joys and sorrows, their breaths, and their struggles. The source of creation is the people, their lives, and their struggles, which is an unshakable truth. Fighting and revolutionary writers must throw themselves into the fiery struggle of the people. Only in this way can we truly understand the thoughts, emotions, wishes, and struggles of the people, and only in this way can we write works that truly reflect the lives and struggles of the people and contribute our strength to the people's revolutionary cause. Literature and art should not and cannot be separated from politics. Our standard should be: all works that are beneficial to the unity of the peoples of various Asian and African countries against imperialism and the struggle for national liberation are good works; all works that hinder the unity of the peoples of various Asian and African countries against imperialism and the struggle for national liberation, and all works that attempt to drag history backward are bad works. In the surging anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, Asian and African writers have surged into the ranks of the Asian and African peoples' struggle on a larger scale, learning from the people and writing for the people, and many works have powerfully expressed the common struggle and aspirations of the Asian and African peoples. In this regard, we are pleased to see that the fighting writers of Vietnam have set an excellent example for us. They wrote many works that inspired millions of people to fight bravely in the midst of enemy fire, gunfire, and the people's war. The "Living Like Him" and "The Country Has Risen" published by the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers are excellent examples. These works not only had a great impact on the Vietnamese people but also promoted and enhanced the revolutionary spirit of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and inspired the national liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The fundamental difference between the progressive and revolutionary literature and art of the Asian and African peoples and the decadent and reactionary literature and art of imperialism and modern revisionism lies here.

History has proven that literature and art in the hands of progressive and revolutionary writers can serve the people's revolution and people's war; while literature and art in the hands of imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices can only serve counter-revolution. The Asian and African peoples have a long and brilliant cultural tradition and have created a wealth of cultural treasures for humanity. However, due to the destruction of imperialism and colonialism for hundreds of years, the national culture of the Asian and African peoples has been severely damaged. We know that imperialism and colonialism often start with cultural infiltration to carry out aggression. Literature and art have always been one of their main weapons to carry out aggression and infiltrate other countries. American imperialism intends to use this infiltration to prepare conditions for subversion, attack, and aggression against other countries. American imperialism exports a large amount of decadent literature, music, films, etc., to the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, blatantly advocating pornography, murder, hypocritical humanitarianism, the so-called American way of life, and war terror to strengthen its nuclear blackmail and nuclear threat. Their so-called works deliberately defame the image of the masses, slander the people's revolution and national liberation movement. These decadent literary works are like "opium," poisoning and numbing the minds of the Asian and African peoples, undermining their struggles, and at the same time, strangling the national culture and traditions of Asia and Africa. We should not forget that American imperialism, in order to attack and oppress other nations, not only uses military bases but also uses cultural bases. Therefore, whether it is to strive for independence or to maintain the independence we have already achieved, we must not only destroy its military bases but also destroy its cultural bases. Many countries in Asia and Africa have already banned American literature, music, and films, closed the American Information Service, and expelled the American so-called Peace Corps. These all fully prove that the awakened Asian and African peoples have understood the dangerous role of American cultural aggression on people's minds and understood how much American cultural aggression can destroy the national culture of a country.

In addition to opposing the cultural aggression of imperialism, we must also expose the "Trojan Horse" of American imperialism, which is Soviet modern revisionist literature. Modern revisionist literature, under the banner of "revolution," actually peddles the private goods of advocating the American way of life, and its content is extremely obscene. There is a novel called "Zhaxia," in which they let the "hero" in the work claim: "Conquering the city requires bravery, conquering women requires shamelessness." In describing a just revolutionary war, they sing the praises of a traitor who surrendered to the enemy as a hero, reasoning that "because he is a human being." In describing the heroic people's anti-fascist war, they exaggerate the horrors of war, exaggerate the destruction of cities, and describe the corpses on the battlefield in a bloody manner. Their works can only serve to corrupt the minds of the Asian and African peoples, undermine the revolutionary will of the Asian and African peoples, and promote the philosophy of surrender and survival at any cost. They tell people: when imperialism launches an aggressive war, to survive and to keep the city, one should kneel and surrender, and not wage an anti-aggression war. They do not distinguish between aggression and anti-aggression, between just and unjust wars, and oppose all wars indiscriminately. They openly advocate "East-West cooperation" in literature, saying: "I support peace—I support not only the peace of Rosenberg and Fast with the United States but also the peace of Truman and Acheson with the United States." These hypocritical writers, who wear the cloak of revolution, are traitors through and through.

Dear colleagues:

Today, the world is experiencing a process of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. As fighting and progressive writers of Asia and Africa, we must be more vigilant and more conscious of our inviolable principles and sacred duties. We have the responsibility to actively participate in the current struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys and defenders. We must oppose their aggression, expose their heinous crimes, and expose the vicious propaganda they spread through literature and art. We must let the world see and know the capitulationist nature of the pseudo-revolutionaries, making the people aware of the danger of these traitors. Just as we must oppose the infiltration of imperialist literature and art into our countries, we must also resolutely resist the counter-revolutionary thoughts and capitulationist propaganda spread by those who pretend to be revolutionaries. The literature of pseudo-revolution is more vicious than the reactionary literature of imperialism. Revolutionary literature is the product of revolutionary writers. Since this is the case, how can these hypocritical revolutionaries fantasize that their literature is revolutionary? Their literature is the literature of capitulationism. It is the special forces of imperialist literature infiltrating from within the Asian and African writers to carry out sabotage activities. As fighting and progressive writers, we must distinguish our thoughts from those of the imperialists and their accomplices. We cannot and should not allow peace and compromise with them.

The great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution will have a profound impact on the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples

Dear colleagues:

Here, I would like to talk with excitement about the fact that this meeting is being held during the great upsurge of the Cultural Revolution in our host country, the Chinese people. We Asian and African writers naturally care deeply about this revolution of the Chinese people. The great victory of the current Cultural Revolution in China is not only greatly promoting the progress of Chinese socialism but will also have a profound impact on the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples.

We are pleased to see that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has brought about a new situation. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary intellectuals, are not only the masters of the state but also the true masters of the cultural and ideological realm. They have shed old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits; they have already created many literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works that reflect new people, new ideas, new customs, and new habits, which fully reflect the heroic spirit and fighting spirit of the Chinese people in creating history. We are convinced that these new literary and artistic works of the Chinese people will have a positive impact on the literary movement of Asia and Africa.

Dear colleagues:

The Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers, since its establishment, has done a lot of concrete and positive work and achieved certain results. Regarding the work we have done, I can only give a brief report to everyone. The Standing Bureau has consistently and unshakably supported the national liberation struggles of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and colonialism, issued many statements and documents; supported and participated in the activities of various international progressive organizations; after the Bali Executive Committee meeting, the Standing Bureau sent two friendly delegations to visit seventeen countries in Africa and Asia, which were warmly welcomed by the colleagues and peoples of these countries. These visits strengthened the revolutionary unity of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism, enhanced the fighting friendship of the Asian and African writers, and promoted the cultural exchange between Asia and Africa. At the end of 1964, the Standing Bureau, together with the Asian and African Writers' Liaison Committee of China, jointly held the Asian and African Literary Symposium in Beijing. Writers from Cambodia, Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Indonesia, Japan, Sudan, Thailand, and Zimbabwe participated in the symposium, which had a lively discussion on the common fighting tasks of the Asian and African peoples and writers. They also widely exchanged experiences in the struggles and literary work of the Asian and African peoples. Everyone agreed that Asian and African writers must hold high the banner of opposing American-led imperialism and old and new colonialism, and the literary movement must be combined with this fighting task, making the pen of the writers a sharp weapon in the struggle. To further strengthen the cultural exchange between the countries of Asia and Africa, to learn from each other and inspire each other, and to promote the wide spread of Asian and African revolutionary literature, the Standing Bureau is editing and publishing a series of "Asian and African Literature" in English and French. So far, the "series" has published six volumes, including the two Vietnamese works "Living Like Him" (Pan Shiqian) and the novel "The Country Has Risen" (Yuan Yu) that I mentioned above, as well as "The Silence of the Ashes" by Algerian writer Kadour Mouhssine, "The Storm of Africa" by Malian poet Mamadou Gologolo, as well as "Nepal Poetry Selection" and "Vietnam Sketch Collection" by several Chinese writers. The common feature of these works is the combination of vivid revolutionary content and excellent artistic form. We believe that these works will definitely be warmly welcomed by Asian and African readers. We are convinced that the other works included in this series will add new wealth to the treasury of Asian and African literature. In addition, the Standing Bureau has also published "How People Should Treat People" by Sri Lankan writer Silva (T.G.W. De Silva), who recorded the situation of the Bali Executive Committee meeting in poetic form and expressed the lofty goals of the Asian and African writers' movement. At the same time, the first volume, second part of "Asian and African Poetry Selection" has also been published, and "Asian and African Novel Selection" is also being edited. The Standing Bureau, in order to accumulate materials and promote the study and exchange of Asian and African literature, after appropriate preparation and with the support of many Asian and African countries, established the "Asian and African Library" in September 1964. The library is located in Colombo and has a considerable number of books and periodicals in English, French, Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and Sinhala. At the suggestion of Chinese friends, the Standing Bureau is planning to establish a "Asian and African Sanatorium" that can be used by writers from both continents of Asia and Africa. Regarding the other work done by the Standing Bureau, I will not list them one by one here.

We have made our due contributions to the development and maintenance of our national culture. We firmly believe that the development and maintenance of a country's national culture are inseparable from the struggle against American-led imperialism, old and new colonialism, and all their accomplices. A country cannot imagine maintaining the dignity of its national culture if it does not first eliminate the imperialists or their influence. It is precisely for this reason that we Asian and African writers have unhesitatingly thrown ourselves into the people's anti-imperialist struggle.

In the world, especially in Asia and Africa, the revolutionary struggle that is surging higher and higher, as well as the victories achieved in this struggle, have inspired us to write creative works, and the works we have already written have in turn inspired the people to fight more powerfully against the enemy.

We are loyal to the people and their struggles, exposing the imperialists and their treacherous nature, exposing the treachery and dirty tricks of the capitulationists, and defeating their conspiracy to jointly sabotage the revolutionary struggles in many places in the world, especially in Asia and Africa. The writers of many of our countries have successfully carried out the struggle against the infiltration of imperialist culture, successfully counterattacked the so-called revolutionary literature of those so-called revolutionaries, and created a national culture with its own distinctive features. Any achievements we have made will inevitably arouse the hatred of the enemy and various saboteurs. Similarly, due to the development of the Asian and African writers' movement and the achievements made by the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers in its work, the special forces of American imperialism have been trying in every possible way to sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement and the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers. They attack the Asian and African Writers' Conference for "only talking about politics and not about literature." This is a shameless attempt to separate literature from politics, to revise the correct line of anti-imperialist and revolutionary unity of the Asian and African writers, and to turn the Asian and African Writers' Conference into an organization of "peace, literature, and welfare." They resist and attack the work of the Standing Bureau, trying in every possible way to sabotage the Standing Bureau or to bring the Asian and African writers' movement under their control to realize their line of capitulation and splitting the revolutionary movement.

The successful holding of the Asian and African Writers' Emergency Conference fully proves that the Soviet modern revisionists are doomed to fail

Dear colleagues:

We revolutionary Asian and African writers are gathered here today to express our unequivocal support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people to save their country, as well as the struggles of the peoples of other countries to achieve, defend, and consolidate national independence, when we see some sinister dark forces carrying out the most shameless conspiracies to sabotage our historic gathering, split the unity of the Asian and African writers, and sabotage the unity of all the peoples of the Asian and African countries. However, the fact that so many Asian and African writers are attending this memorable conference fully proves that those splitters, the Soviet modern revisionists, are doomed to fail.

The Soviet splitters, as lackeys of American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, to realize their evil conspiracies, precisely chose this moment when the Asian and African writers are strengthening their unity to support Vietnam and support the national liberation struggles of other Asian and African countries.

Under the instigation and command of the Soviet splitters, a so-called "emergency conference of the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers" was held in Cairo from June 19 to 20, 1966. This is a serious crime of the Soviet splitters to openly split the Asian and African people's movement, and the consequences are fully borne by the Soviet splitters. They took illegal and shameful steps, created a fake Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers, and supposedly dismissed our respected secretary-general.

It is truly regrettable that Cairo was chosen as the venue for this split conference. The Soviet splitters used this conference to create trouble and sabotage the Asian and African writers' movement and the struggles of the peoples of the Asian and African countries.

The Soviet splitters proposed and decided at the illegal Cairo conference to hold a so-called Asian and African Writers' Conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, of the Soviet Union, which completely tore off their own masks. Thus, after establishing a fake Standing Bureau and absurdly appointing a so-called secretary-general, they went on to organize a fake Asian and African Writers' Conference in the Soviet Union. I think now everyone can see clearly that the Soviet splitters are the real criminals and the ringleaders of all split activities, which have been carried out against our movement for a period of time and reached a climax at the Cairo split conference.

After issuing repeated warnings, the meeting of the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers held in Beijing on June 23, 1966, unanimously declared: "The Soviet writers who engaged in split activities, due to their deliberate sabotage of the Asian and African writers' movement, have fundamentally cut themselves off from the ranks of the Asian and African writers and have forever lost all rights and positions in the Standing Bureau of Asian and African Writers."

In this regard, the position of the Standing Bureau is completely consistent with the wishes and demands of the Asian and African writers, and the Asian and African writers are extremely indignant at the sabotage activities of the Soviet splitters.

Dear colleagues:

I am about to conclude my report. We have always been at the forefront of the revolutionary movements and struggles of the Asian and African peoples against American-led imperialism and its lackeys. We have made our due contributions in uniting the revolutionary writers of the two continents and forming a united front with them against our common enemy, American imperialism. This anti-American united front cannot include the lackeys and accomplices of American imperialism. The Asian and African revolutionary writers have not only been fighting on the battlefield but also have been struggling on the cultural and artistic fronts. Through our works, we have strengthened the unity and fighting spirit of the Asian and African peoples who are resolutely fighting to liberate their own countries and achieve independence and peace.

The progressive writers of Asia and Africa are dedicated to the noble common cause of the Asian and African peoples. We will accomplish this task. We will continue to advance. No force of American-led imperialism will stop us; no force of the lackeys of imperialism will stop us; no force of the accomplices of imperialism will stop us; no force in the world will stop us. We will fight, fight again, advance, and advance again until we achieve complete victory.

Thank you.

    曼努维拉在亚非作家紧急会议上宣读常设局秘书长的报告
    用笔杆狠狠打击亚非人民公敌美帝和苏修集团
    坚决支持越南人民反对美帝、解放南方、保卫北方、重新统一祖国的斗争亲爱的同事们：
    首先让我向你们，来自亚非两洲远近各国应邀参加亚非作家紧急会议的全体代表们，致以热烈的、兄弟般的欢迎。大家知道，我们召开这次紧急会议主要是为了履行我们亚非作家——亚非进步作家不可推卸的义务，那就是坚决支持英勇的越南人民反对美帝国主义者、解放南方、保卫北方、重新统一祖国这一场生死的斗争。
    同时，请允许我首先代表常设局向中国作家协会表示我最深切的感谢，感谢他们为这次会议能在高举毛泽东旗帜，站在世界革命前列的七亿人民的伟大国家中华人民共和国的著名首都北京举行提供了一切方便。
    越南人民英勇斗争的辉煌胜利，向世界证明美帝国主义是可以打败的
    亲爱的同事们：
    今天，越南人民反对美国侵略者的英勇斗争已经成为全世界、特别是亚洲和非洲的反帝人民和反帝力量的注意中心。美帝国主义者悍然破坏日内瓦协议，完全不顾全世界的谴责，完全不尊重主权和独立，这不但引起了越南人民的仇恨和愤慨，也引起了全世界热爱解放、热爱自由、热爱和平的人民的仇恨和愤慨。
    面对着绝望的境地，面对着一个决心战斗到他们国土获得解放的民族，美帝国主义者盲目地把在南越的侵略战争逐步升级。它们已经投入了二十七万五千多名侵略军，并且还纠集它们的仆从菲律宾、泰国、澳大利亚和新西兰政府以及朴正熙集团提供更多的炮灰，或加速和加强他们在物质上对其侵略行为的合作。美帝国主义者用B—52这种类型的飞机来对学校、医院、住房、宗教场所进行狂轰滥炸，屠杀无辜的男女和儿童。它们还以空前的规模残暴地使用毒气和高浓度化学毒剂，屠杀人民，毁坏庄稼、牲畜和家禽。他们犯下了最严重的罪行，其极端残酷是人类历史上无与伦比的。美帝国主义打算用它的“杀光、烧光、毁光”政策将南越投入血海之中。此外，它还设立所谓“战略村”这种不折不扣的集中营，囚禁了千千万万的无辜人民。
    这种新的、无效的、要使越南人民屈服的战争升级，一方面进一步证明美帝国主义是全世界进步和爱好和平人民的头号敌人，另一方面暴露了美帝国主义在南越已陷入垂死挣扎的境地。这证明美帝要竭尽一切力量来挽回它在南越的不利局势，同时也显示了越南人民抵抗美国侵略者的决心越来越大，越来越强。这证明美帝国主义决不会改变其好战本性，直至它彻底失败；同时也证明在争取自由的斗争中，决定性的因素是人而不是武器。美帝国主义者越是进行战争升级，就越是接近它在越南的末日；它越是进行战争升级，英勇的越南人民取得的辉煌胜利就越伟大。任何野蛮的暴行都不能削弱南越人民战斗到最后胜利的钢铁意志。
    南越解放军和人民在无比英勇地战斗，他们在南越各处，在城市和丛林，在郊区和农村，到处击败和消灭美国侵略军。对英勇的越南人民来说，南越到处是战场。侵略军受到了前后夹攻，他们的机场、军营和宿舍被炸毁，成万的强盗军被歼。所谓战略村被捣毁，变成了战斗村。美帝国主义者和它的傀儡集团的老巢西贡今天也被游击队成功地置于“射程范围”之内。在南越各处，美国侵略者、伪军和雇佣军每天数以千计地被消灭。
    亲爱的同事们：
    英勇的南越人民所取得的辉煌胜利向我们说明了什么呢？它们给了全世界什么教训呢？南越人民所取得的空前胜利向世界证明了：美帝国主义不是不可打败的。越南清楚地证明了：热爱自由的革命人民手中的弓箭、砍刀、竹签要比帝国主义者的炸弹、子弹、导弹强有力得多。越南已经充分地告诉我们，帝国主义的任何武器和军队永远不能包围和动摇争取民族解放的人民的巨大堡垒。越南毫无疑问地向世界证明了：帝国主义者所有奴役和剥削人民的狂妄企图终将遭到惨败。越南已完全撕下了美帝国主义的假面具，并向世界揭露了它真正的、恶毒的本质。越南证明了美帝国主义只不过是一个分崩离析的垂死力量，正在迅速走向死亡。在越南，我们看到了武装斗争是对付以美国为首的所有帝国主义者和新老殖民主义者的唯一办法。虽然美帝国主义在南越进行垂死的挣扎，但是它还千方百计赖在南越不走，直到最后的时刻。就在最近，约翰逊政府已开始从西欧撤出更多的军队，以增强在南越的军事部署，扩大侵略南越的战争。我们知道，美帝从西欧撤出军队投入南越，是得到欧洲的一个所谓社会主义大国的共谋默契的，以便让美帝国主义放手继续其侵略活动。但这也合理地证明了美帝国主义在对越南的侵略中已经感到兵力的严重不足。这也有力地证明了：爱国武装力量在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，正越来越迅速地歼灭美国侵略军；美帝国主义在南越已到了穷途末路了。
    美帝国主义者绝望挣扎，想从它们自己走进去了的南越的死胡同里走出来，已把它们的侵略战争升级到越南民主共和国、柬埔寨和老挝，甚至还威胁着中国。他们疯狂地轰炸越南民主共和国，肆意侵犯它的领土，粗暴地向它挑衅。美帝国主义对越南民主共和国人民进行了卑鄙、野蛮的侵略，想以此来吓倒他们，迫使他们屈服。它指望削弱英雄的越南北方人民的战斗力。但是在斗争中经过锻炼的英勇的越南北方人民给予了侵略者以沉重的打击，告诉了他们一个普遍真理：不管他们使用的是什么武器，他们或任何其他牌号的帝国主义者都不能吓倒或征服革命的人民。我们完全拥护越南北方人民为了维护他们的主权和独立所采取的一切措施。美国侵略者的飞机最近侵入中华人民共和国领空，击落一架正在进行训练飞行的中国飞机，这清楚地证明了美国侵越战争正在向其他国家扩展。我们严厉谴责美帝国主义对中华人民共和国的这种放肆的挑衅行动。我们完全支持英勇的中国人民为了维护他们的领土完整、保卫他们伟大的社会主义国家所采取的坚定立场。
    假革命者贩卖美帝和谈骗局，出卖越南人民，妄图实现两大国主宰世界的阴谋
    约翰逊政府玩弄一切阴谋诡计来欺骗越南人民，妄想从南越不可脱身的窘境、从越陷越深的泥沼里拔出身来。约翰逊一边向南越增兵，疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国，并把它的侵略扩大到别国，一边却大谈“和平谈判”、“无条件讨论”和“社会改革”，以掩盖其战争部署，企图平息南越人民的愤怒，使他们放下武器。但是南越人民知道，全世界知道，在这狡猾伎俩的薄纱下面隐藏着美帝国主义的侵略面目以及它想从谈判桌上得到它在战场上得不到的东西的阴险目的。越南人民知道，全世界知道，同侵略者进行“和平谈判”不会带来他们所渴望的真正的和平。越南人民知道，全世界知道，“无条件讨论”只会使他们向侵略者无条件投降。同杀人犯还谈得上什么“讨论”，谈得上什么“谈判”？同抢劫了他们国家的强盗，还谈得上什么“讨论”，谈得上什么“谈判”？
    历史上充满显著的例子说明了这个无可争辩的真理：只有通过革命斗争，只有打败和消灭侵略者，才能赢得自由与和平。越南人民要取得他们的自由，也必须走所有被压迫民族和人民在过去为争取自由所走过的道路。约翰逊这些明显的骗局将被抛到历史的垃圾堆里，受到应有的鄙弃。我们亚非作家坚决支持越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。美帝国主义必须立即停止对整个越南的侵略，从越南南方撤出一切侵略军，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民的唯一代表，越南问题必须由越南人民自己解决。
    亲爱的同事们：
    当美帝国主义不仅引起了南越人民、而且引起了世界上所有爱好和平、爱好自由的人民的仇恨和愤慨的时候，在它处于死亡边缘的时候，有些人却自动地跑出来挽救它。这些所谓的革命者今天已经成为美帝国主义最大的保卫者。他们今天已经成为美帝国主义的主要同盟者。他们配合美帝国主义的阴谋和行动，以便主宰世界。他们已经完全向美帝国主义投降，这样做就背叛了亚非拉的民族解放斗争。他们比美帝国主义者更危险，因为他们是披着羊皮的狼。他们假装支持越南人民，但是同美帝国主义者勾结，出谋划策，破坏越南人民的斗争。他们高喊支援越南人民解放南越和保卫越南民主共和国，但却到世界各地兜售美帝国主义者破旧的“和谈”骗局，迫使越南人民向侵略者投降。然而在世界各地兜售“和谈”骗局时，这些假革命者就象第三等的掮客，不，象第四等的掮客一样无能，他们被人们撵走以后，就带着这批货色回到了家里。但是这些拿着亚非人民的命运做生意的政治掮客并不甘心他们的失败，还在继续兜售肮脏的货色。他们最近转弯抹角地提出什么“和平谈判”解决越南问题的所谓五项“前提”；他们把南越人民唯一合法的代表越南南方民族解放阵线说成是“谈判的伙伴”；他们以美军“开始撤退”和“终止增加”来响应约翰逊的“分阶段撤军”的叫喊，实际上他们是只谈不撤；他们还在南越的“内政”和“自决”的幌子下，企图永远分割越南，阻挠越南人民重新统一祖国。这些无耻的叛徒对待越南人民正义的英勇斗争的态度充分暴露了他们堕落、可耻和卑鄙的本性以及他们所执行的投降主义路线。这些假革命者企图贩卖美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局，实际上是企图出卖南越人民，妄图实现两大国主宰世界的阴谋。他们所有自称是解决越南问题的真诚的建议表明了他们完全同美帝国主义勾结在一起，使它继续镇压南越人民。不管他们进行些什么投降主义的宣传，不管他们怎样来为美帝国主义洗刷，已经选择了革命路线的越南人民和全世界各国人民是不会受这些叛徒的欺骗的。越南人民相信，全世界所有革命的、进步的人民相信，胜利是一定属于越南人民的。我们亚非作家严厉谴责这些叛徒的罪恶阴谋，号召亚非作家和亚非人民同声共讨之，群起而攻之。
    现在国际形势是东风压倒西风。亚非拉人民的革命斗争必将使美帝国主义粉身碎骨
    亲爱的同事们：
    我们今天聚集在这里，面临着目前国际形势中比任何时候都要巨大的变化。在这个变化过程中，我们看到了一股汹涌的潮流在全世界、特别是在亚洲和非洲，迅速地、比任何时候都更迅速地在发展着。这一股潮流的特点是：高涨的、激烈的、比任何时候都要激烈的反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的势力的斗争。这是一场两种不同力量，革命力量和反革命力量之间的斗争；这是一场亿万人民争取解放，走向胜利的斗争，而以美国为首的帝国主义者及其仆从正在走向死亡。在世界历史上，美帝国主义从来没有象今天这样孤立。在世界历史上，美帝国主义从来没有遭到象今天这样惨重的失败。在世界历史上，美帝国主义从来没有象今天这样虚弱。人民的政治觉悟和革命精神，尤其是亚非人民的政治觉悟和革命精神已经大大提高，他们今天已经拿起武器向几十年来一直压迫他们的、以美国为首的帝国主义者及其走狗展开了坚决的斗争。现在正是东风压倒西风。美帝国主义及其走狗没有任何力量能够扑灭燃遍全世界、特别是燃遍亚洲和非洲的熊熊革命烈火。席卷亚非拉三大洲的人民斗争的强大风暴必将把美帝国主义冲到岩石上，使之粉身碎骨。美帝国主义通过它的反革命全球战略的政策对人民进行罪恶的侵略，从而为自己走向末日开辟了道路。
    因此我们看到，国际上革命和进步运动的形势正在进入一个新的阶段。在世界上很多的国家，人民已经起来向美帝国主义及其走狗和傀儡展开了坚决的斗争。他们正在进行着一场坚决的斗争，争取民族独立与和平，或者是保卫已经赢得的独立。
    柬埔寨人民树立了坚决反对美帝国主义及其阴谋的斗争的榜样，美帝国主义在它的曼谷和西贡走狗帮助下阴谋破坏柬埔寨人民的主权和中立。美帝国主义者在它的走狗的共谋下几乎每天都在对这个和平国家的边境进行侵略，这并不是什么秘密了。他们正在肆无忌惮地侵犯这个国家的领空，威胁这个国家人民的生命安全。
    最近，美帝国主义者为了寻找借口来替自己袭击柬埔寨这种挑衅性的措施辩解，诬告柬埔寨隐藏外国军队。柬埔寨人民不仅驳斥了这种虚构，而且要求美帝国主义者就他们的诬告拿出证据来。我们完全支持柬埔寨爱国人民为反抗美国侵略者及其奸细的恶毒进攻和保卫他们的民族独立、领土完整、中立和和平而进行的坚决斗争。
    在老挝，老挝爱国力量和人民正在对美帝国主义者渗入其领土破坏民族解放运动的企图进行英勇的斗争。美帝国主义者利用它的仆从——泰国军队——侵犯老挝领土并同老挝右派军队一起进攻爱国武装力量和老挝人民。
    在过去两年中，美国各种飞机疯狂地轰炸了老挝解放区。在过去两年中，美帝国主义及其走狗妄想迫使老挝人民放弃他们作为一个自由的民族所不可剥夺的权利的企图失败了。他们今后要征服老挝人民的企图也将遭到同样的失败。
    美帝国主义者正在利用泰国军队对南越、柬埔寨和老挝进行侵略，就在泰国，它也正面临着更大的困难，泰国人民团结在泰国爱国阵线的周围，联合起来，为了取得真正的自由、和平和进步，正在同美帝国主义以及当地的傀儡政权进行斗争。
    在南朝鲜，美帝国主义者在它走狗的帮助下所扶植起来的法西斯军事政权，在南朝鲜爱国人民的猛烈打击下已经开始摇摇欲坠。在过去的二十年中，美帝国主义一直在阻挠朝鲜的统一和残酷镇压朝鲜人民。美帝国主义和朴正熙集团合伙搞的罪恶的“日韩条约”，不仅是为了维持它在南朝鲜的残暴统治，也是为了继续它的侵略政策。美帝国主义现在正在竭力实现所谓的“东北亚军事同盟”，利用它来挽救它在南朝鲜以及它正在进行侵略的亚洲其他地区的失败。
    不论美帝国主义使用什么手段，它也不能继续镇压朝鲜人民，它再也不能阻止朝鲜人民统一他们的祖国。它这种不受欢迎地、不合法地赖在南朝鲜的日子肯定是不长了。
    在日本，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其忠实走狗——反动的佐藤政府——的坚决斗争正在日益壮大。大家知道，美国在日本约有两百个军事基地，这是美帝国主义对亚洲执行侵略性战略的主要工具。最重要的是，美帝国主义已经把冲绳群岛变成一个巨型的核基地，并且充分使用这个基地对越南人民进行侵略战争，虽然这个群岛是日本的领土，住着日本人。因此，日本人民，包括冲绳居民在内，为了使冲绳归还日本而进行的斗争，其目的不仅在于使日本政府能够恢复行政事务的管理，而且在于把美国军队从那里驱逐出去和铲除所有军事基地。我们认为，日本人民必须收回他们的合法领土冲绳群岛的全部主权。
    日本人民的斗争的最重要目的之一，是废除“美日安全条约”。这个条约不仅是美国在军事、政治、经济和文化方面统治日本的核心，而且是美帝国主义者和日本反动派之间侵略性同盟的核心。因此，渴望真正独立和和平的日本人民必须为反对“美日安全条约”、反对“东北亚条约组织”的轴心“韩日条约”和反对复活日本军国主义和经济扩张的阴谋进行无情的斗争，这就成了很自然的事。
    在美帝国主义和日本反动统治集团走上危险的战争道路的巨大压力下，英勇的日本人民决心不惜任何代价要获得和平、独立和进步，以便成为亚非人民的真正朋友。
    巴基斯坦人民为维护民族独立和捍卫他们的国家：不受某些人扩张主义的冒险行为的侵犯而进行的斗争是正义的和神圣的斗争。爱国的巴基斯坦人民富有反帝国主义和反殖民主义的斗争传统，他们决不允许美帝国主义或者它的走狗破坏他们的独立和主权。爱国的巴基斯坦人民知道谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人，因此他们不会由于美帝国主义或它的任何走狗和辩护士的恐吓和强迫而牺牲他们得来不易的自由。
    克什米尔人民正接近完成自决的目标，他们采取坚定的立场，反对美帝国主义和假革命者积极支持的、让那些没有任何权利的人来篡夺他们国土的一切阴谋活动。这些人和克什米尔的反动邻人，恬不知耻地破坏了联合协定，他们对爱好和平的克什米尔人民进行不断的侵略，并剥夺他们抉择自己命运的权利。这种侵略行为受到美帝国主义及其同谋者的充分赞许及无保留的支持。这些同谋者公开协助反动的扩张主义者扑灭克什米尔人民的解放运动。但是克什米尔人民，使用自己无可否认的权利来决定自己前途的日子已为时不远。
    印度人民正处于水深火热之中，他们不顾印度当局的野蛮镇压，正在全国各地掀起大规模的反饥饿、反压迫的斗争，这场斗争得到了亚非各国进步人民的同情和支持。
    最近，菲律宾的反美运动也加剧了，进步的、有民族意识的菲律宾人民正在强烈反对美国对他们国家的影响。
    在马来亚，由于马来亚民族解放军的不屈不挠的斗争，马来亚人民在最近十八年来，已经英勇地多次击退美国支持的英国军队所发动的集中进攻，后者人数比他们多许多倍，拥有喷气式飞机、轰炸机、坦克以及其它现代化杀人武器。因此，英帝国主义者曾被迫一再承认他们的武装镇压已经失败。为了维持他们摇摇欲坠的殖民统治，他们在军事行动以外还使用新的政治策划。这样，阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼和李光耀傀儡集团就粉墨登场，而在过去九年中，策划了一个又一个新殖民主义阴谋——所谓马来亚联邦的独立，所谓新加坡的自治地位，在美帝和被美国控制的联合国以及他们的辩护士支持下创建的所谓“马来西亚”，新加坡脱离这个新殖民主义计划“马来西亚”，以及最后“给予”他们的驯服的走狗李光耀集团以所谓独立。
    这些英国精心策划的“宪法”手段，不管怎样狡猾地加以伪装，都是他们企图维持殖民统治，同时配合美国全球战略、为他们的“苏伊士以东”政策服务的绝望挣扎。
    全世界进步的公众舆论严正地谴责这些假革命者的叛徒行径，他们迫不及待地出来帮助英帝国主义者支撑在国际舞台上陷于孤立的新加坡李光耀傀儡政权。同印度尼西亚反动派的军事政变一样，雅加达法西斯政权对新加坡假独立的承认，马利克和拉扎克的曼谷会谈都是美英帝国主义所指使的，而且是他们镇压马来亚（新加坡是它的组成部分）、北加里曼丹、印度尼西亚以及其它东南亚国家民族解放运动阴谋的重要部分。
    马来亚人民完全识破这些帝国主义和假革命者的阴谋，他们正在加强各个领域中的斗争，消灭以美国为首的帝国主义和它们的帮凶。马来亚人民的运动——粉碎“马来西亚”，推翻吉隆坡和新加坡的傀儡政权，实现一个包括新加坡在内的重新统一的马来亚的真正独立的运动——正在进入新的高潮，并将毫无疑义地取得胜利。
    不顾英帝国主义者及其走狗阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼和李光耀的野蛮、持续的镇压，北加里曼丹人民争取完全民族独立，反对新殖民主义计划“马来西亚”的武装斗争，正在坚决地、大力地继续进行着。尽管有纳苏蒂安—苏哈托军事独裁政权的背信弃义行径，北加里曼丹人民仍然接二连三地打击着英帝国主义者和他们的“马来西亚”走狗。亚非作家将永远支持北加里曼丹人民争取真正民族独立的斗争。
    中东国家的人民，为了维护民族独立，掀起了反对帝国主义的斗争。他们已经团结起来，以便解放被占领的巴勒斯坦，也就是所谓的以色列——美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的一个驯服的工具。我们知道，以色列是美国一手制造的，作为它侵略独立的阿拉伯国家和渗入非洲国家的一个基地。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人，在巴勒斯坦解放组织的领导下，决心击败美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的阴谋，夺回他们被抢占的国土。巴勒斯坦人民在他们重返家园的斗争中，得到所有亚非人民的毫无保留的支持和声援。
    虽然美帝国主义打算把它的仆从以色列变成一个有核武器和其他类型武器的基地，以便侵略阿拉伯国家，但我们相信，他们阴险的野心是不能实现的。在反帝斗争中经过锻炼的阿拉伯人民决不会听任帝国主义者破坏和颠覆他们的独立。美帝国主义的任何力量也阻挡不了阿拉伯人民维护民族独立的斗争。美帝国主义的任何力量也阻止不了巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民收复他们的家园。
    亚非人民反对“伊斯兰条约”再一次证明了人民是不会受美帝国主义者的欺骗的。亚非人民已经认识到了美帝国主义者及其爪牙所策划的这个侵略条约的危险性。它是一个分裂亚非人民而不是团结他们的条约。通过这个条约，美帝国主义者及其仆从企图滥用宗教来离间有宗教信仰的人们，在他们中间制造争端，破坏他们的进步。美帝国主义制造这个条约是要重新回到它已经被赶出去的国家之中。美帝国主义想滥用宗教来实现其野心并压迫人民的一切企图，是注定要失败的。
    在南也门、亚丁和阿曼，那里人民的争取独立的生死斗争使得以美国为首的帝国主义与殖民主义势力陷于很困难的境地。
    美帝国主义永远孤立不了中国。中国的朋友遍天下。中国掌握核武器是对亚非拉被压迫人民的巨大鼓舞
    面临着横扫亚洲的汹涌澎湃的反美怒潮，美帝国主义玩弄了另一种手法来挽救它的灭亡。它已开始把全球战略重点东移，妄想在亚洲进行大规模的侵略。美帝国主义这一恶毒行动无疑首先是为了执行它“遏制中国”的政策。约翰逊政府自己已经透露，在美国新的军事援助计划中将包括对南越、泰国、朴正熙集团、蒋介石匪帮和其他傀儡更多的军事援助。这主要是为了加强对中国已经形成了的军事基地包围圈，企图孤立中国。这里必须指出，对于这个注定要失败的包围圈，有一个社会主义国家的领导集团，完全堕落成美帝国主义的帮凶，正忙于垒砖抬土，企图加固这个包围圈，把中国孤立起来。七亿中国人民已经发出誓言，做好充分准备，在任何地方、任何时候来对付美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶。美帝国主义永远孤立不了中国。中国是一个日益强大的国家，在它的周围团结了越来越多革命的和进步的人民。中国的朋友遍天下，所谓孤立中国的包围圈，实际是套在美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶脖子上的绞索，将要把他们绞死。
    最近中国第三颗核弹的爆炸粉碎了美帝国主义和假革命者保持核垄断、对一切革命人民进行讹诈的猖狂野心。中国手中的核武器就是所有为解放自己国家而斗争的革命人民手中的武器。我们相信，全世界所有爱好和平的人民也都相信中国拥有核武器完全是为了自卫，是为了保卫世界和平。中国手中的核武器，对于已经起来反对美帝国主义的亚非拉被压迫的人民来说，是一个巨大的鼓舞。中国手中的核武器，也为全世界人民争取完全禁止和彻底销毁一切核武器创造了有利条件。
    我们坚信，美国正无理霸占着的中国领土台湾，终将重新回到它合法的所有者手中。
    非洲人民已经英勇地站了起来，帝国主义和殖民主义必须从非洲滚出去
    在非洲大陆，非洲的解放运动比任何时候都要尖锐、坚强和壮大。今天，以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者，在它们一直压迫非洲人民的每一个地方所面临的失败和挫折比任何时候都要惨重。非洲人民抵抗殖民主义者一手策划的伊安·史密斯在津巴布韦片面宣布独立，这表明了帝国主义者和殖民主义者都欺骗不了非洲人民。史密斯在这个国家里的少数白人种族主义政权正遭到人民的极端的仇恨和愤慨，因为他们被剥夺了在自己的国家按照自己的方式生活的自由。他们已经决定，取得真正独立的唯一方法是武装斗争，而在这个斗争中，他们得到亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的全力的支援。
    在阿扎尼亚（南非），反对维沃尔德政权野蛮的法西斯政策的革命运动，在阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会的正确领导下，已经壮大起来。维沃尔德这个帝国主义的头号代理人、南非人民权利最凶恶的镇压者，在人民争取建立一个民主独立的阿扎尼亚的斗争中，正遭到坚决的回击。
    刚果（利）人民的武装斗争正深入发展，他们正高举帕特利斯·卢蒙巴的革命旗帜，为粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的狡诈阴谋而进行英勇不屈的斗争。
      “葡属”几内亚、莫三鼻给和安哥拉人民所开展的反对以美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者的武装斗争，正受到世界上所有进步人民的支持和同情。他们的斗争，给了他们的共同敌人又一个沉重的打击。
    几内亚、马里、坦桑尼亚和刚果（布）的人民不断地击退了帝国主义者的颠覆阴谋，并且正在保卫着他们的独立和赢来不易的革命果实。
    在巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、斯威士兰、西南非洲、法属索马里、赤道几内亚和加那利群岛，人民更加警惕由美帝国主义者支持的殖民主义者所玩弄的、迫使他们放弃争取解放与和平的斗争的诡计。这些国家的人民相信，压迫他们、对他们横行霸道的人是不会自动地把真正的独立送给他们的，他们决心进行革命斗争，直到解放自己的国家。
    帝国主义者和殖民主义者在压迫非洲人民、榨取他们国家财富方面，已经差不多走到了路的尽头了，曾经被奴役几十年的这个大陆的人民已经英勇地站了起来，推翻帝国主义和殖民主义统治，为自由与和平而战斗。这不是已经被一九五五年以来非洲的独立国家从四个增加到三十六个这一显著的事实所证明了吗？这不是证明了非洲已经觉醒并正朝着它的目标前进吗？的确，非洲应该而且必须属于非洲人，帝国主义者和殖民主义者应该而且必须从非洲滚出去。他们如果不走，就将被踢出非洲。今天，革命的、爱好自由的非洲人就是在这样做的。
    拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的反抗越来越强烈，美帝国主义及其走狗的日子不会长了
    在拉丁美洲，美帝国主义罪恶的侵略行径已经使拉丁美洲人民加强了他们的反抗。美帝国主义对多米尼加人民要求自由和独立的意志的公开、无耻的镇压暴露了它的真正本性。美帝国主义为了蒙混和欺骗人民并继续军事霸占多米尼加共和国，最近策划了一次假的总统选举，并让它的一个忠实走狗当了政，但是，多米尼加人民立即强烈抗议这一美国策划的选举，这说明了多米尼加爱国人民不准备也不愿意屈从美帝国主义。厄瓜多尔反民族的军事政权的垮台毫无疑义地证明了，美帝国主义或它的走狗继续镇压人民的日子不会长了。今天，我们在拉丁美洲人民中间看到了他们对美帝国主义越来越强烈的仇恨，以及他们进行反击、要作自己命运主人的越来越高昂的革命精神。他们进行了武装斗争，并动摇了美帝国主义在他们国土上的根子。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲是如此拚命企图挽救自己，以至到处疯狂奔走，想组成一支泛美侵略部队，来干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政，破坏他们的民族愿望。但是拉丁美洲人民不会让美帝国主义者永远剥削他们和掠夺这个大陆的资源。
    不管美帝国主义者怎样设法来破坏拉丁美洲的解放运动，组织侵略军也好，通过经济讹诈也好，它们都是注定要失败的。许多拉丁美洲国家的人民已经拿起了武器，只有在自己国家不再受美国侵略的时候，才会放下武器。
    美帝国主义正在走下坡路，越来越接近它的末日，这是千真万确的。但是，具有所有帝国主义国家的本性的美帝国主义，是不会自行灭亡的，这也是千真万确的。它不会甘心于自己的命运，不会甘心于过去一切帝国主义者所遭受的命运，直到最后进行垂死的挣扎。因而，我们看到，美帝国主义在垂死之际还在疯狂地维护着它在世界各地的日益缩小的权力。它在极力策划或者企图策划一个又一个的政变，扶植一些傀儡为它的目的效劳。
    亚非作家强烈谴责印尼法西斯军事政权的野蛮罪行，并坚决支持印度尼西亚革命力量
    在印度尼西亚，美帝国主义及其代理人中央情报局，经过长期的颠覆活动和政变图谋之后，终于搞了一个以右派将领纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的法西斯军事政权。这个法西斯军事政权胡作非为，实行恐怖统治，镇压和迫害印度尼西亚人民，毁坏他们的革命成就和成果。
    印度尼西亚高涨的革命形势吓坏和激怒了以纳苏蒂安和苏哈托为首的反动的右派将领集团，他们和美帝国主义及其代理人中央情报局，同谋篡夺了政权。在“九月三十日事件”中，爱国的军官正确地采取行动来阻止反动将领的罪恶企图，军队中的右派势力就以这次事件为借口，疯狂地对印度尼西亚进步人士以及民主人士，特别是共产党人、进步的民族主义者和爱国的宗教界人士，进行了一场绝灭人性的大屠杀、大逮捕、大拷打和大迫害，借此来发泄他们对人民，对人民的革命和成就的仇恨。这种恐怖同恶毒而血腥的反华、反中国人的种族主义运动发生在同一个时候，并不是偶然的。它为反对中国的美国全球战略，所谓“遏制中国”的政策效了劳。
    到现在为止，已有三十多万印度尼西亚爱国者被残酷屠杀，同时还有更多的人正在狱中和集中营里受折磨，只是因为他们爱国和保卫印度尼西亚的革命。印度尼西亚所有的进步组织都被取缔。许多和这些组织有联系的作家和艺术家被囚禁、遭迫害。同我们一起创建了我们这个组织的许多印度尼西亚作家，现在命运未卜。
    我们知道，印度尼西亚曾经站在反帝斗争的最前列，坚决地支持亚、非、拉的解放运动。我们都看到了在一九六五年“十月事件”以前印度尼西亚的文学艺术和文化出现了一个巨大的革命高潮。那时，印度尼西亚进步的作家和艺术家们向美帝国主义的文化渗透和破坏以及“普遍人性论”的辩护士们所宣扬的假革命文化发动革命的进攻，从而建立起符合他们民族特点的人民的文化。
    但是，今天我们看到纳苏蒂安和苏哈托法西斯军事政权正在把这个国家拉到美帝国主义的屁股后面，使这个国家的革命倒退。这种阴险的意图表现于印度尼西亚停止对抗“马来西亚”这个新殖民主义的产物，它是在美帝国主义积极支持下，由英国殖民主义者建立起来，用以镇压马来亚（包括新加坡）人民和北加里曼丹人民的民族解放斗争，并用以破坏印度尼西亚和其他东南亚国家的独立和主权。近来美国、日本佐藤政府和其他一些勾结帝国主义的国家这样乐意向印度尼西亚提供“援助”，清楚地说明，纳苏蒂安和苏哈托法西斯军事专政正在把这个国家引向何处。
    我们亚非作家强烈谴责纳苏蒂安和苏哈托法西斯军事政权对印度尼西亚人民犯下的野蛮罪行，并表示我们坚决支持印度尼西亚革命力量。这些法西斯暴行并不显示美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的仆从们是强大的。恰恰相反，这只能证明他们的极端虚弱和迅速接近死亡。
    目前出现在印度尼西亚上空的乌云只是暂时的现象。今天，忠实于他们的革命和斗争传统的印度尼西亚人民正在重新组织他们自己，起来反对纳苏蒂安和苏哈托法西斯政权。印度尼西亚的作家们正在和他们的人民一道站了起来。
    我们坚信，印度尼西亚爱国人民的抵抗运动，用过去的革命经验武装自己，并在当前的严酷考验的风暴中得到锻炼，必将发展壮大。邪恶的黑夜必将迅速变成光明的胜利的白天。
    加纳右派的政变已经完全暴露了以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义又一次企图重使年青的非洲独立国家殖民化的背信弃义的阴谋。美英共同策划的这一阴谋，暴露了帝国主义反对独立的非洲国家和破坏非洲团结新的恶毒诡计。这是帝国主义要阻止在非洲大陆上高涨的反帝反殖运动的一种企图。
    自从加纳获得独立以来，由于采取反帝的立场，它成了帝国主义、殖民主义及其走狗的眼中钉，对加纳的这次颠覆行动，就是以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义在其当地仆从的帮助下推翻维护主权和独立的非洲政府的无耻阴谋。
    近几年来，非洲的解放运动日益高涨，非洲人民采取了坚定的反帝立场，执行了独立的政策。这吓坏了帝国主义，它千方百计地阻挡这个潮流，公开或暗地里来破坏非洲人民的愿望。这个由美帝国主义和英国殖民主义同它们的走狗一起策划和执行的卑鄙行动，是对全体非洲人民和世界进步人民公开的挑战。非洲、亚洲或世界任何其他地方所有热爱自由与和平的国家或民族，都不能不谴责这个由帝国主义和它的走狗联合进行的挑衅性的进攻。我们知道，加纳人民正在经历着一场考验；我们也知道，加纳人民终将赢得胜利。
    美帝国主义的这些干涉和颠覆活动清楚地表明了它还想压迫人民、还想把人民踩在它脚下的狼子野心。这些活动表明，帝国主义和殖民主义在最后垮台以前，还要用其最后一点力量来掀起一股暂时的逆流，妄想挽救他们的死亡。但是同帝国主义的希望相反，它在一些国家的疯狂反扑已经引起人民更大的警惕和反抗。这只会使强大的反帝风暴更快地在亚非拉蔓延开来。这是帝国主义不能逃避的一个历史事实和历史规律。历史已经表明，所有的革命运动都经历过起伏和成败；历史已经证明，革命运动每遭一次失败之后，就会大踏步的前进。
    苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义的仆从、出卖亚非人民利益的叛徒，起了任何帝国主义和各国反动派都不能起的作用
    当美帝国主义正在遭受全世界人民的反对，包括美国人民从美帝的心脏给以沉重打击的时候，当人民力量的巨大风暴正把它打得粉碎的时候，我们今天看到了苏联修正主义领导集团在耍又一种肮脏的政治诡计。当美帝国主义这座摇摇欲坠的房子将要倒塌的时候，这些虚伪的革命者却出来支撑它挽救它。他们已经变成了美帝国主义得力的保护者。他们同美帝国主义勾结，合谋破坏世界上许多国家的民族解放斗争。他们已经背叛了对于一切争取解放、和平与民主的人来说是神圣和可贵的革命的观念和原则。
    这些所谓革命者却单单把已经削弱了的美帝国主义看成“巨人”，他们害怕这个“巨人”，因此与之妥协，与之勾结。当美帝国主义内部反对它的风暴正在酝酿的时候，当象洛杉矶起义这种事件清楚地证明被剥削群众的革命在高涨的时候，这些所谓革命者却协助美帝国主义野蛮地镇压亚非拉人民争取独立的斗争。就在他们大肆宣扬他们支援世界革命运动的同时，他们却日夜为美帝国主义辩护和找借口。他们宣称自己是革命运动和被压迫人民的朋友。但是事实上，他们只不过是美帝国主义的仆从，民族解放运动的破坏者，出卖亚非人民利益的叛徒。事实上，他们充当了国际帝国主义的社会支柱，扮演了帝国主义破坏各国人民革命斗争的别动队的不光彩的角色，起了任何帝国主义和各国反动派都不能起的作用。为了实现和美国共同主宰世界的迷梦，他们一再吹捧帝国主义者是“明智派”，“温和派”，说“约翰逊得到了人民的绝对委任状”。他们一再鼓吹他们同美帝的合作，宣传两国之间有着“十分广泛的合作天地”。他们在联合国内外同美帝国主义做了许多肮脏的政治交易。他们不断宣称，可以通过联合国来消灭殖民主义，把独立“恩赐”给被压迫的人民。事实上，他们在联合国内和美帝国主义合作，镇压亚非拉人民的民族解放运动。他们和美帝国主义合作，企图扑灭亚非拉人民革命的熊熊烈火。他们不是一起策划派出美国控制的联合国部队去刚果，杀害了非洲的伟大英雄卢蒙巴吗？他们不是同美国一起在安理会投票赞成联合国干涉多米尼加吗？他们不是无视非洲各国人民的反对，在安理会上一起投票赞成由支持史密斯的后台老板英国去“平定”南罗得西亚的局势，镇压津巴布韦人民的解放斗争吗？他们不是热中于成立联合国常设部队，联合美国去武装镇压民族解放斗争吗？事实还远不止此。他们多次同美帝国主义及其走狗南越傀儡、南朝鲜集团、以色列、“马来西亚”和蒋介石匪帮坐在一起，共同策划以实现美帝国主义统治亚洲人民的阴谋。他们正同美帝国主义及其走狗同谋对克什米尔的和平人民进行侵略。他们正同美帝国主义者及其走狗勾结阻挠巴勒斯坦人民重新收复他们的家园。特别可恨和令人气愤的是他们明目张胆地同美帝国主义及其走狗勾结，出卖越南人民的英勇斗争。他们投降美帝，认敌为友的言行，铁证如山。他们有时也装着支持亚非拉人民的斗争，间或也骂几句美帝，但这丝毫不能说明他们有什么改变。这只能更加清楚地说明他们是多么虚伪、狡猾、阴险、恶毒，欺骗世界人民，以实现他们同美帝国主义合作主宰世界的阴谋。这些叛徒的所作所为只能充分暴露他们是假反帝、真投降，假革命、真出卖，假朋友、真分裂。
    对于这些人投入帝国主义的阵营，我们并不感到奇怪，因为我们知道：物以类聚。这里我愿引用一个革命记者的一句话：美帝国主义者和这些人过去是在暗中握手，今天却在公开亲吻，并且一点不感到羞耻。
    今天，世界革命人民越来越亲近，他们正在反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的旗帜下紧密团结起来。和那些假装是正在进行斗争的人民的朋友的人不同，我们争取的是建立在坚定、正确的反帝路线基础上的团结。我们要同所有反帝的革命力量团结，而不同那些与美帝勾结并帮助美帝镇压和压迫人民的人团结。我们要团结，要真正的团结，而不是假团结。我们告诉那些假革命者，在真正的、广泛的、团结的国际反美战线中，没有他们的位置，因为他们已经背叛了人民和人民的事业。如果这个统一战线竟然包括这些美帝国主义的帮凶，岂不是连美帝国主义本身也可以包括进去吗？反美统一战线岂不是变成了联美统一战线吗？这是绝对不可能的。我们只能从各方面同他们彻底划清界限，揭露他们罪恶的阴谋，同他们进行斗争。
    让这些叛徒同美帝国主义去和平共处、去妥协吧。但是我们不能！我们不能同他们和平共处，也不能同他们妥协，因为我们深切地知道：美帝国主义是亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的共同死敌。
    这个世纪是人民的世纪。以美国为首的帝国主义者不管如何貌似强大，无论使用什么办法，都不能打败争取解放的人民。美帝国主义已经激起了人民，引起了他们的革命运动，使自己陷入包围之中。美帝国主义逃脱不了等待着它的必然死亡的命运。美帝国主义死亡之时，也将是它的走狗和傀儡亡命之日。那些向美帝国主义及其走狗和傀儡投降的、并和他们一起阴谋策划出卖人民的人，也将随同他们一起灭亡。
    亚非战斗的革命的作家必须投身到人民的火热的斗争中去，必须积极参加当前反对美帝及其走狗和辩护士的斗争
    亲爱的同事们：
    今天我们亚非进步作家在这里聚会，主要是为了支持和声援越南人民解放自己国土的英勇斗争，同时也是为了支持亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    作为献身于两大洲人民革命事业的作家，我们的责任和任务就是把我们的笔变成强大的武器。一切危害亚非人民革命事业的黑暗势力都必须揭露，一切推动亚非人民前进的革命斗争都必须歌颂。这就是落在我们亚非进步作家肩上的神圣任务。为了亚非人民的共同正义事业，我们应当用笔杆狠狠打击和揭露亚非人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗，以及那些狡猾的假革命者的叛徒嘴脸，使亚非人民群众看清楚谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。同时，我们有责任让全世界了解亚非人民斗争的真实情况，拿起我们的笔杆去歌颂亚非各国人民英勇豪迈的精神，鼓舞他们的反帝斗志。
    进步的、革命的作家，总是把他们的生活和人民的生活融合在一起，与他们同甘苦，同呼吸，共战斗。创作的源泉是人民，他们的生活和斗争，这是颠扑不破的真理。战斗的、革命的作家必须投身到人民的火热的斗争中去。只有这样，我们才能真正懂得人民的思想、感情、愿望和斗争，才能写出真正反映人民的生活和斗争的作品，为人民的革命事业贡献出我们的一份力量。文学艺术不应该、也不能够脱离政治。我们的标准应该是：一切有利于亚非各国人民团结反帝、争取民族解放的作品，一切推动历史前进的作品，都是好作品；一切不利于亚非各国人民团结反帝、争取民族解放的作品，一切企图拉着历史倒退的作品，都是坏作品。在亚非人民风起云涌的反帝斗争中，亚非作家更大规模地涌进了亚非人民战斗的行列里去，向人民学习，为人民写作，许多作品有力地表达了亚非人民的共同斗争和愿望。在这个方面，我们高兴地看到，战斗的越南作家为我们树立了出色的榜样。他们在敌人的炮火中、枪林弹雨中，在人民战争中，写出了许多鼓舞千百万人民进行英勇斗争的作品。亚非作家常设局出版的《象他那样生活》和《祖国站起来了》就是很好的样板。这些作品不仅对越南人民发生了巨大的影响，而且在亚非拉人民当中，也促进和提高了人民的革命精神，鼓舞了亚非拉的民族解放运动。亚非人民进步的革命的文学艺术与帝国主义、现代修正主义的腐朽的反动的文学艺术的根本区别就在这里。
    历史已经证明，文学艺术掌握在进步的、革命的作家手里，可以为人民革命和人民战争服务；而文学艺术掌握在帝国主义以及它的走狗和帮凶手里，只能为反革命服务。我们亚非人民有着悠久灿烂的文化传统，为人类创造出十分丰富的文化财富。但是几百年来由于帝国主义和殖民主义的摧残，亚非人民的民族文化受到严重的破坏。我们知道，帝国主义和殖民主义为了进行侵略，经常是先从文化渗透开始的。文艺向来就是它们用来进行侵略并向其他国家渗透的主要武器之一。美帝国主义想通过这种渗透为颠覆、进攻和侵略其他国家准备条件。美帝国主义向亚非拉国家大量输出颓废的文学、音乐、电影等，赤裸裸地宣扬色情、凶杀，宣扬伪善的人道主义，宣扬所谓美国生活方式，宣扬战争恐怖来加强它的核讹诈和核威胁。他们的所谓作品故意丑化人民群众的形象，污蔑人民革命和民族解放运动。这种种腐朽的文学作品，就象“鸦片”一样，毒害和麻醉亚非人民的心灵，瓦解他们的斗争，同时扼杀亚非的民族文化和传统。我们不应该忘记，美帝国主义为了进攻和压迫其他民族，不仅使用军事基地，而且使用文化基地。所以，不论是争取独立，还是维护我们已经取得的独立，我们不仅应该摧毁它的军事基地，而且也必须摧毁它的文化基地。亚非两洲的许多国家已经禁止美国的文学作品、音乐和电影，关闭了美国新闻处，驱逐了美国的所谓和平队，这些都充分地证明觉醒了的亚非人民已经懂得美国文化侵略对于人民思想所起的危险作用，懂得美国文化侵略对一个国家的民族文化能破坏到何种程度。
    除了反对帝国主义的文化侵略之外，我们还必须揭露美帝国主义的“特洛伊木马”，这就是苏联现代修正主义文学。现代修正主义文学挂着“革命”的招牌，实际上贩运宣扬美国生活方式的私货，内容的荒淫无耻达到极点。有一本叫《卓霞》的小说，他们让作品中的“英雄”宣称：“夺取城市靠勇敢，征服女人凭无耻”。他们在描写正义的革命战争时，把一个投敌的叛徒歌颂成英雄，理由是“因为他是一个人”。他们在描写英雄的人民反法西斯战争的作品里，极力描绘战争恐怖，夸张地描写城市的毁灭，血淋淋地描写战场上的尸体。他们的作品，只能起到腐蚀亚非人民心灵、瓦解亚非人民革命斗志的作用，他们宣扬投降主义、不顾代价的活命哲学。他们告诉人们：当帝国主义发动侵略战争时，为了活命，为了保住城市，就应该屈膝投降，不要进行反侵略战争。他们不分侵略与反侵略、正义与非正义的战争，一律反对。他们公然鼓吹文学上“东西方合作”，说什么“我拥护和平——我不仅拥护同罗森堡和法斯特的美国的和平，也拥护同杜鲁门先生和艾奇逊先生的美国的和平”。这种披着革命外衣的虚伪作家，是彻头彻尾的叛徒。
    亲爱的同事们：
    今天，世界上正经历一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程。我们作为亚非战斗的、进步的作家必须更加警惕，更加意识到我们不可侵犯的原则和神圣的职责。我们有责任积极参加当前反对美帝国主义及其走狗和辩护士的斗争。我们必须反对他们的侵略，必须揭露他们的丑恶罪行，还必须揭露他们通过文艺所散布的恶毒宣传。我们必须让全世界看到和知道假革命者的投降主义本质，使人民对这些叛徒的危险性警惕起来。正如我们必须反对帝国主义的文学艺术向我们的国家渗透那样，我们也必须坚决抵制那些假装的革命者所散布的反革命思想和投降主义的宣传。假革命的文学比帝国主义的反动文学能够产生更恶毒的作用。革命的文艺是革命作家的产物。既然这样，这些伪善的革命者怎么能想入非非，称他们的文艺是革命的呢？他们的文艺是投降主义的文艺。它是打进亚非文学来从亚非作家内部进行破坏活动的帝国主义文学别动队。作为战斗的、进步的作家，我们必须把我们的思想同帝国主义者及其勾结者的思想区分开来。我们不能够，也不应该容许同他们和平共处。
    中国文化大革命的伟大胜利，必将对亚非人民的革命事业产生深远的影响
    亲爱的同事们：
    这里，我要以兴奋的心情谈到我们这次会议是在我们的东道主——中国人民正在进行声势浩大的文化大革命高潮中举行的。我们亚非作家，自然非常关怀中国人民的这个革命。当前中国文化大革命的伟大胜利，不但正在大大推动中国社会主义事业的前进，也必将对亚非人民的革命事业产生深远的影响。
    我们高兴地看到中国的文化大革命已经出现新的形势。广大工农兵和革命知识分子不仅是国家的主人，也是文化思想领域里真正的主人。他们摆脱了旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯；他们已经创作出许多表现新人物、新思想、新风俗、新习惯的文学、戏剧、音乐、美术作品，这些作品充分表现了中国人民创造历史的英雄气概和战斗精神。我们深信中国人民这些新的文学艺术作品，对亚非的文学运动将起到积极的推动作用。
    亲爱的同事们：
    亚非作家常设局自从建立以来，已经做了许多具体和积极的工作，取得了肯定的成就。关于我们所进行的工作，我只能向大家作一个简略的报告。常设局一贯坚定不移地支持亚非人民反帝、反殖的民族解放斗争，发表了许多声明和文件；支持并参加了国际进步组织的各种活动；巴厘执委会会议以后，常设局派出了两个友好代表团，分别到十七个非洲和亚洲国家进行了访问，受到了这些国家的同事们和人民的热烈欢迎。这些访问加强了亚非人民反帝的革命团结，增进了亚非作家的战斗友谊，促进了亚非的文化交流。一九六四年底，常设局与亚非作家中国联络委员会在北京联合召开了亚非文学座谈会。柬埔寨、喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、印度尼西亚、日本、苏丹、泰国和津巴布韦的作家参加了座谈会，热烈地讨论了亚非人民和亚非作家的共同战斗任务。他们也广泛地交流了亚非人民斗争和文学工作的经验。大家一致认为，亚非作家必须高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的旗帜，文学运动必须和这个斗争任务相结合，使作家的笔杆在斗争中成为锐利的武器。为了进一步加强亚非各国的文化交流，互相激励，互相学习，促进亚非革命文学广泛传播，常设局正在用英法两种文字编辑出版一套《亚非文学丛书》。到现在为止，“丛书”已出了六册，包括我在上面已经提到的两部越南作品《象他那样生活》（潘氏娟）和小说《祖国站起来了》（原玉），还有阿尔及利亚作家卡杜尔·穆罕撒吉的《灰烬的沉默》，马里诗人马马杜·戈洛戈的《非洲的风暴》，以及《尼泊尔诗选》和几位中国作家合写的《越南特写集》。这些作品的共同特点是生动的革命内容与出色的艺术形式相结合。我们相信这些作品一定会受到亚非读者的热烈欢迎。我们深信收入这套丛书的其它作品将对亚非文学的宝库增添新的财富。此外，常设局还出版了锡兰作家西尔瓦（T·G·W·De·Silva）的《人应该怎样待人》，他以诗歌形式记述了巴厘执委会会议的情况，表达了亚非作家运动的崇高目标。同时，《亚非诗选》第一卷第二部也出版了，《亚非小说选》也正在编辑中。常设局为了积累资料，促进亚非文学的研究、交流，经过适当的筹备和在许多亚非国家的支持下，于一九六四年九月建立了“亚非图书馆”。馆址设在科伦坡，已藏有相当大量的英、法、汉、俄、越、蒙、僧伽罗等语言的书籍和报刊。在中国朋友的提议下，常设局正在筹划建立一所亚非两大洲的作家都可使用的“亚非疗养院”。至于常设局所做的其他工作，在这里就不一一列举了。
    我们对于发展和维护我们国家的民族文化已经做出了应有的贡献。我们坚信，发展和维护一个国家的民族文化是同反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其一切帮凶的斗争分不开的。一个国家如果不首先消灭帝国主义者或他们的影响，就不能设想去维护它的民族文化的尊严。正是由于这种原因，我们亚非作家才毫不犹豫地投入到人民的反帝斗争中去。
    在全世界，特别是在亚非进行的日益高涨的革命斗争，以及在这斗争中所取得的胜利，鼓舞了我们要写出具有创造性的作品，而我们已经写出的作品反过来也鼓舞了人民更有力地与敌人战斗。
    我们忠于人民和人民的斗争，揭露了帝国主义及其阴险的本性，揭露了投降分子及其肮脏的诡计，并击败了他们对世界许多地方，特别是亚洲和非洲的革命斗争联合进行破坏的阴谋。我们许多国家的作家胜利地进行了反对帝国主义文化渗入的运动，成功地反击了那些所谓革命者的所谓革命文艺，创造了具有自己的鲜明特色的民族文化。我们获得的任何成就，必然会招致敌人和各种破坏分子的憎恨。同样，由于亚非作家运动的发展，由于亚非作家常设局在工作中所取得的成就，美帝国主义的别动队就千方百计地妄图破坏亚非作家运动，破坏亚非作家常设局。他们攻击亚非作家会议“只谈政治，不谈文学”。这是无耻地企图把文学与政治割裂开来，修正亚非作家的反帝革命团结的正确路线，把亚非作家会议变成“和平、文学、福利”的组织。他们抵制和攻击常设局的工作，千方百计搞垮常设局，或者把亚非作家运动抓到他们的手中，以便实现他们的投降路线和分裂革命运动的路线。
    亚非作家紧急会议的胜利举行，充分证明苏联现代修正主义者是注定要失败的
    亲爱的同事们：
    我们革命的亚非作家今天在这里聚会，向英雄的越南人民的救国斗争，以及其他各国人民争取、维护和巩固民族独立的斗争，表示我们毫不含糊的支持的时候，我们看到一些阴险的黑暗势力进行最无耻的阴谋来破坏我们这次有历史意义的集会，分裂亚非作家的团结，并破坏所有亚非各国人民的团结。但是，有这样多的亚非作家出席这次值得纪念的会议，这一事实就充分地证明那些分裂主义者，苏联现代修正主义者，是注定要失败的。
    苏联分裂主义者，作为美帝国主义和各国反动派的走狗，为了实现其恶毒的阴谋，恰恰选中了亚非作家加强团结来支援越南、支援亚非其它各国人民的民族解放斗争的这一时刻。
    在苏联分裂主义者的唆使指挥之下，于一九六六年六月十九至二十日在开罗举行了一个以“亚非作家常设局紧急会议”为幌子的冒名会议。这是苏联分裂主义者公开分裂亚非人民运动的一桩严重的罪行，其后果完全由苏联分裂主义者负责。他们采取了非法和可耻的步骤，制造一个伪亚非作家常设局，并且所谓撤销我们尊敬的秘书长的职务。
    真正令人遗憾的是，开罗被做为这个分裂会议的地点，苏联分裂主义者利用这个会议来捣乱并破坏亚非作家运动和亚非各国人民的斗争。
    苏联分裂主义者在非法的开罗会议上提议并决定在苏联阿塞拜疆的巴库召开一次所谓的亚非作家会议，这就完全撕下了他们自己的假面具。这样，他们就在建立伪常设局和荒谬地委任了一个所谓秘书长等等之后，他们又进而在苏联组织一次伪亚非作家会议。我想，现在我们每一个人都看得清清楚楚，苏联分裂主义者是真正的罪犯，是所有分裂活动的祸首，这种分裂活动，针对我们的运动已经进行了一个时期，在开罗分裂会议上达到了高潮。
    在向他们多次发出警告以后，一九六六年六月二十三日在北京召开的亚非作家常设局会议一致宣布：“从事分裂活动的苏联作家由于蓄意破坏亚非作家运动，从根本上已经自绝于亚非作家的队伍，并且永远丧失了在亚非作家常设局中的一切权利和地位。”
    在这方面，常设局的立场是和亚非作家的愿望和要求完全一致的，亚非作家对于苏联分裂主义者所进行的破坏活动感到极大愤慨。
    亲爱的同事们：
    我就要结束我的报告了。我们一直是站在亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的革命运动和革命斗争的最前列。我们在团结我们两大洲的革命作家以及和他们一道组成反对我们的共同敌人——美帝国主义的统一战线方面，已经作出了我们应有的贡献。这个反对美帝的统一战线决不能包括美帝国主义的走狗和帮凶。亚非革命作家不仅一直战斗在战场上，而且还一直奋斗在文化和文艺战线上。通过我们的作品，我们加强了为解放自己的祖国、为获得独立与和平而正在坚决战斗的亚非人民的团结和战斗精神。
    亚非进步作家献身于亚非人民崇高的共同任务。我们将完成这个任务。我们将继续前进。以美国为首的帝国主义的任何力量都阻挡不了我们；帝国主义走狗的任何力量都阻挡不了我们；帝国主义的同谋者的任何力量都阻挡不了我们；世界上任何力量都阻挡不了我们。我们将战斗，再战斗，前进，再前进，直到完全胜利。
    谢谢你们。
                              （文内插题是本报编者所加）
