Vietnamese People's Army Headquarters Condemns U.S. Airstrikes on Hanoi and Haiphong Suburbs
Calls on Military and Civilians to Defend the Capital and Port, Defeat American Aggressors

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, June 29th – On the evening of the 29th, Major General Hoang Van Thao, representing the Vietnamese People's Army General Headquarters, held a press conference and released a statement from the Vietnamese People's Army General Headquarters. The statement strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' latest escalation of the war by bombing the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong. It also sternly warned the American aggressors that all their escalations will be crushed and all their crimes against the Vietnamese people will be punished.

	The statement said that on June 29th, U.S. imperialism committed a very serious new act of war escalation. They dispatched multiple waves of aircraft to repeatedly attack the suburbs of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Haiphong. They indiscriminately bombed and strafed residential areas and economic facilities, causing some casualties and property damage to our people.

	The statement said that the American aggressors' evil escalations have been met with appropriate punishment. The military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong, with deep hatred and high vigilance, have decisively defeated the American aggressors and, in coordination with the people's air force, have repelled the enemy's multiple attacks, achieving glorious victories. Preliminary reports indicate that the local military and civilians have shot down seven U.S. aircraft, damaged several more, and captured a number of American pilots. Among these, the military and civilians of Hanoi and the people's air force shot down four enemy aircraft, while the military and civilians of Haiphong shot down three enemy aircraft.

	The statement warmly praised and commended the units that achieved victory, and warmly commended the cadres and people of Hanoi and Haiphong for their close unity, brave fighting, and joint efforts with the troops to defeat the American aggressors.

	The statement said that the Vietnamese military and civilians must further heighten their vigilance, deepen their hatred for the enemy, and continue to fight fiercely and accurately to defend the beloved capital and port of the motherland. They must strive for more and greater victories in both production and combat.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, June 29th – On the afternoon of the 29th, the "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcasted a commentary, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong and the people's air force, who shot down seven U.S. jet aircraft and captured multiple American pilots on the afternoon of the 29th.

	The commentary said that the victory achieved by the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong today is a stern warning to the American aggressors: no matter how much they escalate to Haiphong port or Hanoi, no matter how high they fly or what tricks they play, the Vietnamese military and civilians will not let them escape.

	The commentary pointed out that while the U.S. imperialists are frantically sending more troops to South Vietnam, they are also desperately trying to justify their intensified destructive war against the North. Today's pirate attacks in the skies over Hanoi and Haiphong further exposed the deceitful "peace" rhetoric of the Johnson administration.

	The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' escalation to Hanoi and Haiphong further proves that they are in a desperate situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam. The more they escalate to Hanoi and Haiphong, the more they will face even more severe defeats and the more they will be condemned by world public opinion.

	The commentary called on all Vietnamese military and civilians to remain vigilant at all times, deepen their hatred for the American aggressors, bravely and tirelessly do a good job in air defense, and more fiercely retaliate, giving the American air pirates a more powerful blow.

	The commentary called on the military and civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong to compete with their comrades in the South, bravely fight, and continue until all American air pirates are completely annihilated!

    越南人民军总部发表公报强烈谴责美机轰炸河内海防两市郊区
    号召军民坚决保卫首都和海港战胜美国强盗
    新华社河内二十九日电  越南人民军总司令部代表何文楼大校二十九日晚在记者招待会上，公布了越南人民军总司令部的一项公报，强烈谴责美帝国主义悍然轰炸河内和海防郊区的新的战争“升级”罪行，并且严厉警告美国强盗：它们的一切“升级”行动必将被粉碎，它们对越南人民犯下的一切罪行必将遭到惩罚。
    公报说，六月二十九日，美帝国主义进行了极其严重的新的战争“升级”。它们派遣飞机多批，多次袭击越南民主共和国首都河内市和海防市的郊区。它们滥肆轰炸、扫射居民区和经济设施，使我国人民在生命和财产方面受到一些损失。
    公报说，美国强盗的这些罪恶的“升级”行动，遭到了应有的惩罚。河内和海防军民怀着刻骨的仇恨和高度的警惕，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，及时进行了猛烈还击，同人民空军配合，粉碎了敌人的各次强盗进攻，取得辉煌胜利。据初步消息，上述地方军民共击落美国飞机七架，击伤多架，活捉一批美国飞行员。其中，河内军民和人民空军击落敌机四架，海防军民击落敌机三架。
    公报热烈嘉奖和表扬各个战胜单位的功勋，热烈表扬河内、海防的干部和人民紧密团结，英勇战斗，同部队一起战胜美国强盗。
    公报说，越南军民必须进一步提高警惕，加深对敌人的仇恨，再接再厉，狠狠地打，准准地打，坚决保卫祖国可爱的首都和海港，进而在生产和战斗中争取更多的更大胜利。
    新华社河内二十九日电“越南之声”电台二十九日下午广播一篇评论，热烈欢呼河内、海防两市军民和人民空军，二十九日中午一举击落美国喷气式飞机七架，活捉美国飞行员多名的辉煌胜利。
    评论说，河内、海防军民今天取得的这一胜利，是对美国强盗的严厉警告：不管他们“升级”到海防港口，还是“升级”到河内，不管是升到哪一级，也无论他们在什么高度上飞，玩弄什么伎俩，越南军民都决不让他们逃脱。
    评论指出，美帝国主义一方面疯狂地向越南南方增派军队，另一方面竭力为它对北方加强破坏性战争进行辩护。今天在河内上空和海防上空发生的强盗进攻行动，进一步暴露了约翰逊集团的“和平”欺骗论调。
    评论指出，美帝国主义“升级”到河内市和海防市，这就更加证明了它在越南南方战场上已经处于穷途末路。它越是“升级”到河内市和海防市，就越避免不了更加惨重的失败，越受到世界舆论的谴责。
    评论号召越南全体军民时刻提高警惕，加深对美国强盗的仇恨，勇敢和不懈地做好人民防空工作，更加猛烈地还击，更多地给美国空中强盗以强有力的打击。
    评论号召河内、海防市军民同南方同胞展开竞赛，勇敢战斗，直到把美国飞贼全部消灭光！
