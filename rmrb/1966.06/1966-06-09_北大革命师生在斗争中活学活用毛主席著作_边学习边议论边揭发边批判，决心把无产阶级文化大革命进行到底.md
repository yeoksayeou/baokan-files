    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Our correspondent reports: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University, after achieving a decisive victory in overthrowing a small handful of bourgeois royalists, is continuing to develop rapidly. In the struggle to further deeply expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the Lu Ping clique, the class consciousness and political awareness of the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students have been raised unprecedentedly quickly.

    The broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at Peking University are determined to better arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in this struggle. This is a distinct characteristic of the current Cultural Revolution movement at Peking University and the most fundamental guarantee for the victory of the struggle. People are learning, discussing, exposing, and criticizing simultaneously in the struggle, studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way in the struggle, and resolving to overthrow the bourgeois royalists, the bourgeois "experts," "scholars," and "authorities," sweep away all monsters and demons, and thoroughly criticize and discredit all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the old world. Many departments' revolutionary teachers and students make studying Chairman Mao's writings the first thing they do every morning after getting up. They study Chairman Mao's expositions on class and class struggle, Chairman Mao's theoretical works on the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking on revolutionary movements, and Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to struggle and daring to win. They read every word and ponder and comprehend the spirit of Chairman Mao's teachings, and they link them to the current struggle situation to expose and criticize. Many revolutionary teachers and students have restudied the article "It is a Good Thing, Not a Bad Thing, to Be Opposed by the Enemy." Connecting this to the fact that the Lu Ping clique frantically counterattacked after Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others posted the first big-character poster, they have further realized that it was precisely because this big-character poster struck at the enemy's vitals. They said: "The more the enemy opposes us, the more we must persist in the struggle. We must, as Chairman Mao taught us, be willing to risk our lives and dare to pull the Peking University royalists off their horses!" They also said: "We have thousands of experiences in the struggle, but in the final analysis, there is only one: to have boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought and to treat Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives."

    In the blazing revolutionary flames, those teachers and students who were once deceived by the Lu Ping clique have now returned to the revolutionary ranks and joined the battle to denounce the anti-Party black gang. Some of them wrote on big-character posters that after this struggle, they understood the sharpness and complexity of class struggle, and they understood that those black gang figures who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag were more insidious and more vicious than those who waved the white flag to oppose the red flag, and they must remember this lesson for the rest of their lives. They also expressed that they must work harder to study Chairman Mao's writings, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, closely follow the Party Central Committee, and resolutely strike wherever the Party points.

    According to what our correspondent saw in interviews at Peking University, the big-character posters posted by revolutionary teachers and students these days, which are like a barrage of artillery fire, are continuing to increase exponentially. In the past week, more than 100,000 big-character posters have been posted throughout the university. Not only has the number of big-character posters increased sharply, but many big-character posters have made more extensive, in-depth, and systematic exposures of the Lu Ping clique's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, hitting the vital points of the bourgeois royalists. Teachers and students in the Department of Technical Physics, under the title "A Life-and-Death Class Struggle," systematically exposed in thirty-five pages how the Lu Ping black gang had turned Peking University into a tool for serving the restoration of capitalism. Teachers and students in the Department of Biology used a large number of ironclad facts to expose that Peking University, under the long-term control of the Lu Ping clique, had become their base for poisoning young people and attempting to cultivate bourgeois successors. Teachers and students in the Department of Philosophy and other departments also used dozens of pages to systematically expose the facts of Lu Ping and others' counterattack and settling of scores in the 1965 Socialist Education Movement, carrying out counterrevolutionary restoration, and implementing cruel struggle and merciless blows against revolutionary leftists with shocking and vicious means.

    After the work team headed by Comrade Zhang Chengxian entered the school, it further strengthened its leadership over the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Peking University. In the past two days, a large number of work team members have gone down to various departments to participate in the struggle with the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, and to lead the movement.

    The revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionaries at Peking University in denouncing the bourgeois royalists such as Lu Ping have successively received enthusiastic support from the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country. Since June 1, the revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University have received more than 20,000 letters and telegrams of support from all over the country. Thousands upon thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students in the capital have come to Peking University to express their support. The revolutionary people of the whole country, in the letters of support and big-character posters they sent, have expressed that they must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end together with the revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University.

    北大革命师生在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作
    边学习边议论边揭发边批判，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社八日讯　本社记者报道：北京大学的无产阶级文化大革命，在取得了打倒一小撮资产阶级保皇派的决定性胜利之后，正在继续迅猛地向前发展。广大革命师生在进一步深入揭发和批判陆平等一伙反党反社会主义罪行的斗争中，阶级觉悟和政治觉悟得到了空前迅速的提高。
    北京大学的广大革命师生员工，决心在这场斗争中更好地用毛泽东思想武装自己，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，这是当前北京大学文化大革命运动的一个鲜明特征，也是斗争取得胜利的最根本保证。人们在斗争中边学习、边议论、边揭发、边批判，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，决心斗倒资产阶级保皇派，打倒资产阶级的“专家”、“学者”、“权威”，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把旧世界的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯批透批臭。不少系的革命师生，每天清晨起床第一件事就是学习毛主席著作，他们学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化革命的理论著作，学习毛主席关于革命运动的战略、策略思想，以及毛主席关于敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导。他们一字一句地读，一字一句地琢磨和领会毛主席教导的精神，并联系当前斗争情况来进行揭露和批判。许多革命师生重新学习了《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》这篇文章，联系到陆平等一伙所以在聂元梓等同志贴出第一张大字报以后那样疯狂地进行反扑，就更加认识到正是因为这张大字报刺中了敌人的心窝。他们说：“敌人越反对我们，我们越要坚持斗争。我们一定要按毛主席所教导的那样，舍得一身剐，敢把北大的保皇党拉下马！”他们还说：“我们在斗争中的体会千条万条，归根到底是一条：无比信仰毛泽东思想，把毛主席的书当作最高指示。”
    在炽热的革命烽火中，那些一度被陆平等一伙蒙蔽的师生，现在回到了革命行列，投入了声讨反党黑帮的战斗。他们当中有些人在大字报上写道，经过这场斗争，他们懂得了阶级斗争的尖锐和复杂，懂得了那些打着红旗反红旗的黑帮人物比打着白旗反红旗的人更加阴险，更加毒辣，他们要一辈子记住这个教训。他们还表示，一定要更好地努力学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，紧紧跟着党中央，党指向哪里就坚决地打向哪里。
    据记者在北京大学采访中所见，革命师生这几天来贴出的好象排炮一般的大字报，正在继续成倍地增加。一周来，全校已贴出大字报十万多张。大字报不仅在数量方面猛烈增加，而且许多大字报对陆平等一伙的反党反社会主义罪行作了更加广泛深入系统地揭发，打中了资产阶级保皇派的要害。技术物理系师生以“一场你死我活的阶级搏斗”为题，用三十五张纸的篇幅，系统地揭露了陆平等黑帮怎样把北京大学变成了一座为资产阶级复辟服务的工具。生物系师生以大量铁的事实，揭露出在陆平等一伙长期把持下的北京大学，已经变成他们毒害青年和企图培养资产阶级接班人的阵地。哲学等系师生也用数十张纸的篇幅，系统地揭露了陆平等在一九六五年的社会主义教育运动中反攻倒算，实行反革命复辟，以骇人听闻的恶毒手段对革命左派实行残酷斗争和无情打击的种种事实。
    以张承先同志为首的工作组进校以后，进一步加强了对北大无产阶级文化大革命的领导。这两天来，大批工作组成员已下到各系同广大革命师生一道参加斗争，领导运动。
    北大无产阶级革命派声讨陆平等资产阶级保皇派的革命行动，陆续得到了全国各地工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子的热情支援。六月一日以来，北大革命师生已收到从全国各地发来的声援信和声援电报两万多件。首都有成千上万工人、农民、战士、革命干部和革命师生，前来北大表示声援。全国革命人民在他们送来的声援信和大字报上，都纷纷表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同北大革命师生一道把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
