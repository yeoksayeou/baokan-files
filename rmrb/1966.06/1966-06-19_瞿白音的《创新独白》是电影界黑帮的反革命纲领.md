    Editor's Note: Comrade Ding Xuelei's article exposes and criticizes the poisonous weed "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation." We hope everyone reads it carefully.
    The author of this poisonous weed, Qu Baiyin, is a reactionary bourgeois intellectual, one of the heads of the film industry's gang, and the screenwriter of the reactionary film "Red Sun." In this "Monologue," his talk of "innovation," "removing clichés," "breaking the three gods," etc., are all counter-revolutionary black talk. This so-called "Monologue" is not actually a "monologue" of his alone, but rather an "important document" jointly created by a group of gang members in the film industry through collusion. This "document" is a concretization of Xia Yan's "deviation from the classics theory," a counter-revolutionary program of the gang members in the film industry, and a counter-revolutionary manifesto openly calling on the demons and monsters in the literary and art circles to seize our literary and art positions and implement capitalist restoration. This declaration of theirs, to put it bluntly, is to allow them to have a good time, brandishing their counter-revolutionary pens, and further seize the seals of power they have dreamed of, in order to implement bourgeois dictatorship over our working class and the broad masses of working people. They grit their teeth, aiming their sharp points at the proletarian dictatorship and at the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    Reading the materials revealed in Comrade Ding Xuelei's article, we cannot help but be shocked and filled with righteous indignation. Chairman Mao teaches us that some counter-revolutionaries "have long-term experience in class struggle, and they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal struggle and illegal struggle. We revolutionary parties must understand their tricks and study their tactics in order to defeat them. We must not be bookish and take the complex class struggle too simply." We should bear Chairman Mao's words in mind, keep our eyes open, and heighten our vigilance. Those muddleheaded people who once thought that "scholars cannot rebel" should wake up and actively join the ranks of this Great Cultural Revolution!
    Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance in battle! Drag out all the gang members hidden in every corner. Thoroughly defeat all the counter-revolutionary gangs. All demons and monsters will be shattered by the revolutionary thunder!
    For more than ten years, a black line against the Party and against socialism has ruled the entire film industry from top to bottom.
    In every large-scale class struggle, there is always a group of anti-Party "heroes" in the film industry who step forward to be the vanguard for all reactionary forces. In 1956, Zhong Dianfei emerged, loudly beating the film "gong and drum," making a flamboyant appearance, and opening the prelude to the frantic attack of the bourgeois rightists. In 1962, Qu Baiyin jumped out again in the film industry, brandishing his claws, chanting incantations, stirring up a妖wind of "innovation," and opening the way for capitalist restoration.
    "Monologue on the Issue of Film Innovation" (published in "Film Art," third issue of 1962, hereinafter referred to as "Innovation Monologue") is a literary program that frantically opposes Mao Zedong Thought and a political program that frantically opposes the proletarian dictatorship. Qu Baiyin is not only a reactionary revisionist intellectual but also a thorough individual careerist. He stole the leading position of the Shanghai Municipal Film Bureau, followed the instructions of the heads of the film industry gang, and tried his best to implement their counter-revolutionary action program. The so-called "Innovation Monologue" is not a "monologue" at all, but a "chorus" of a small group of gangs in the film industry. They implemented a counter-revolutionary dictatorship in the film industry, implemented the bourgeois and revisionist literary line, and served the reactionary policy of "peaceful evolution."
    Thoroughly exposing and criticizing Qu Baiyin's "Innovation Monologue" and thoroughly exposing and criticizing the revisionist gang in the film industry is not only a major event related to the future of the socialist film industry but also a major event related to the fate and future of our entire country.
      A Counter-Revolutionary Political Program
    Qu Baiyin's "Innovation Monologue" is a concentrated exposure of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the film industry's gang.
    In "Innovation Monologue," Qu Baiyin put on a fierce look of a "thug," revealing his deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism. In the name of "innovation," he frantically attacked Mao Zedong Thought, frantically attacked the socialist system, and frantically attacked the leadership of the Party.
          In the Name of "Removing Clichés," Frantically Attacking Mao Zedong Thought
    Qu Baiyin, like all class enemies at home and abroad, first aimed the spear of attack at the lifeblood of the proletariat and the working people—Mao Zedong Thought. He slandered Mao Zedong Thought as a "cliché" and openly shouted to "remove clichés."
    Qu Baiyin said: "Although film is the youngest art, it is already filled with clichés." He fabricated the so-called "sins" of the "god of theme," "god of structure," and "god of conflict," and then said with gnashing teeth: "The gods each show their divine power, scattering all kinds of talismans and curses about what should and should not be done. Under the joint attack of the gods, artists can only be tied hand and foot, scratching their heads and looking for a way out. And clichés are the only refuge." The so-called "clichés," as he made very clear in the article, are "words that have been said thousands of times in classic works," are "document instructions," are "well-known ideas," in a word, the "clichés" that Qu Baiyin attacked are Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!
    Qu Baiyin hated Mao Zedong Thought to the bone. In the name of "breaking clichés," he viciously slandered Mao Zedong Thought as "lacking novelty" and "being submerged by the dust of history." This is completely the ravings of a bourgeois representative who is about to be "submerged by the dust of history." His class instinct drove him to stand up and curse, attacking Mao Zedong Thought as "talismans," as "curses," "protected by gods." How familiar the language is! The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng cursed Mao Zedong Thought as "five knives," Qu Baiyin came up with an "innovation," attacking Mao Zedong Thought as "talismans," "curses"! The counter-revolutionary Hu Feng slandered Mao Zedong Thought as the "totem" worshiped by primitive peoples, and Qu Baiyin came up with another "innovation," venomously cursing that Mao Zedong Thought had the "protection of gods." You are all birds of a feather, your counter-revolutionary language is exactly the same, and your frantic attacks on Mao Zedong Thought are also identical.
    Qu Baiyin not only frantically attacked Mao Zedong Thought himself but also incited the demons and monsters in the literary and art circles to oppose Mao Zedong Thought together. In "Innovation Monologue," he called on the bourgeois elements in the film industry to summon up "courage," "insist on the truth, and charge into battle" to fight against "clichés." On the stage of the Second Shanghai Municipal Literary and Art Congress in 1962, he even sprayed saliva, telling people to "stimulate our own acute feeling towards clichés… After feeling the pain, we can have the determination and ambition to remove clichés." He not only "broke clichés" in theory, that is, attacked Mao Zedong Thought, but also "broke clichés" in action with his own "innovative" work "Red Sun." When others gave him opinions when he was writing the screenplay, asking him to express Mao Zedong Thought in his works, he cursed: "Fart!" and said menacingly: "I don't accept your opinions because I can't write a play like this." This completely exposed his counter-revolutionary face.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest guideline for the Chinese people's revolution and socialist construction, a powerful spiritual atomic bomb against imperialism, and the most powerful ideological weapon against modern revisionism. For all class enemies, Mao Zedong Thought is indeed an incomparably sharp knife, but for the revolutionary people, it is an indispensable soul and compass. It will never be "outdated." It is an ever-shining red sun, forever illuminating the world with its truth of ten thousand zhang!
    It is quite natural that all class enemies extremely hate Mao Zedong Thought. However, a mad dog barking at the sun will not harm the sun's brilliance! Demons and monsters can be rampant for a while, but under the illumination of the sun's ten thousand zhang of light, they will inevitably be "submerged by the dust of history." Qu Baiyin and his ilk are no exception!
          Frantically Opposing the Proletarian Dictatorship,
      Vainly Attempting to Realize Bourgeois "Unified Leadership"
    In "Innovation Monologue," Qu Baiyin asked the reader an inflammatory question: "Now a surge of film art innovation is sweeping the world, why don't we need innovation? Can't innovate? Now, thinking about it carefully, I seem to understand a little bit." What exactly did Qu Baiyin understand? Looking at the whole article, the answer is not difficult to find, that is: "The force of habit cannot be underestimated." He also borrowed other people's words to say indignantly: "What 'innovation'! There is nothing new under the sun!" This is Qu Baiyin's black talk. Translating it, it is nothing more than saying: Under the "force of habit" of the socialist system, under the "sun" of the proletarian dictatorship, there can be no "new things," and there is no question of "innovation."
    In Qu Baiyin's writing, the political climate of our society is depicted as chilling and gloomy, "it is still so cold even after Qingming." He shaped the image of a "friend" "wearing a thick overcoat" with his "unique artistic conception." This "friend" is "particularly cautious about new things," constantly "blinking and swallowing" when speaking at the symposium, like a daughter-in-law, not daring to speak freely, looking pitiful.
    Qu Baiyin was still dissatisfied with depicting our socialist system as so "unfree" and describing the proletarian dictatorship as so "gloomy and terrifying." At the Second Shanghai Municipal Literary and Art Congress, he openly issued anti-Communist roars: "In recent years, the truth is extremely precious. A famous actor, a Party member, once said after drinking, he said he wanted to see Chairman Mao and ask for a tablet with the word '免' [miǎn - exempt] written on it, that is, exempt from 'struggle,' so that he could say whatever he wanted. It can be seen that many people want to tell the truth." Look, Qu Baiyin's attack on the proletarian dictatorship has reached such a frantic point! Qu Baiyin vainly attempted to borrow the mouth of some "famous actor," "Party member" to ask the Party for a "struggle exemption" tablet. This is playing a conspiracy: only they are allowed to frantically attack the Party and the socialist system, and the revolutionary people are not allowed to retaliate. We want to tell Qu Baiyin sternly: Don't daydream, the revolutionary people have given you a "struggle exemption" tablet, which means giving up their own dictatorship and disarming themselves. With your "freedom," there is no freedom for us. Our struggle with you is a life-and-death struggle! For counter-revolutionary revisionists like you, we cannot talk about democracy, but only dictatorship. The contradiction between us and you is the contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution. For the enemies of the revolution, Chairman Mao has long said that it is necessary to "exercise dictatorship, exercise autocracy, oppress these people, only allow them to be well-behaved, and not allow them to talk nonsense." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship")
    Qu Baiyin's fundamental purpose in attacking the socialist system and the proletarian dictatorship is to overthrow the leadership of the Party, to seize power, and to let the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line dominate our government. In "Innovation Monologue," he wantonly uglified the leadership of our Party: "Leaders are not always smiling and patting shoulders, and turning yin and yang is like turning their hands." At the Shanghai Film Creation Symposium, he used the dirtiest and most despicable language to curse the leadership of the Party, saying that "from ideological subjectivity and one-sidedness to simplicity and crudeness in style; from imposing personal preferences on others to speaking rudely, hurting people with vicious words, and pointing fingers without learning. It is really a 洋广杂货 [yáng guǎng zá huò - jumbled assortment of goods], everything is available, there are many patterns, and there is no time to record them all." This is such deep-seated class hatred.
    In Qu Baiyin's view, the "sins" of the Party's leadership are simply too many. After fabricating many "charges," he finally revealed his wolfish ambitions. He declared menacingly that "leadership must be improved," and he threatened our Party that if it didn't, it would be "punished." How to "improve leadership"? In "Innovation Monologue," he pointed at the mulberry tree and scolded the locust tree, advising the leaders of the Party: "Would it be more suitable to do work that does not require imagination?" This is blatantly asking the Party to step down! If the Party steps down, who will take the stage? Qu Baiyin then issued an order: "Give the director the power he deserves" and realize the "unified leadership of the director in the production team." Here, Qu Baiyin's talk about letting the director "lead" is actually letting the bourgeois elements grasp the power of the film industry! As for what the Party's leadership should do after stepping down? He openly proposed at the Film Creation Symposium that the Party's leadership could be a "gardener" and "serve" the "flower planters"—that is, their group of bourgeois and revisionist artists—to release anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds along with the "cook." Look, this is Qu Baiyin's "change the world" plan! His "change the world" plan is even more thorough than the counter-revolutionary propositions of all right-wing elements of "taking turns to be the landlord." They want to sit on the "leadership" position forever, want the Communist Party to listen to their commands, and always be the servants of these bourgeois masters. This is their counter-revolutionary wishful thinking.
    Qu Baiyin's appetite is also too big! Like all hostile class elements, he always overestimated his own strength and underestimated the strength of the proletariat and the working people. Qu Baiyin and his ilk are listening: it is easy to shake a mountain, but it is difficult to shake Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian dictatorship, and the leadership of the Communist Party! You few "ants," a few "lame donkeys," overestimate your capabilities, vainly attempting to change the country of the proletariat and all working people, and the result can only be crushed by the wheels of history!
      A Revisionist Literary Program
    The direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the path of literary and art workers integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is a brilliant and important component of Mao Zedong Thought, the new development and highest peak of Marxist-Leninist literary theory, and also the thing that bourgeois literature and revisionist literature fear and hate the most. Therefore, all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in the literary and art circles always aim the spear of attack at Mao Zedong's literary and art thought. The whole set of bourgeois literary programs proposed by Qu Baiyin in "Innovation Monologue" is aimed at tampering with the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the path of workers, peasants, and soldiers: in the name of breaking the "three gods," he vainly attempted to transform the socialist film industry into a capitalist film industry; in the name of establishing "new images," he opposed shaping the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and deliberately created biographies and monuments for demons and monsters; under the pretext of promoting the artist's "broad observation," "basic skills," "style," and "imagination," he vainly attempted to induce literary and art workers to refuse self-transformation, detach themselves from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and embark on the bourgeois and revisionist path.
       In the Name of "Breaking the Three Gods," Opposing the Literary and Art Direction of Serving the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    In "Innovation Monologue," Qu Baiyin cursed the revolutionary literary and artistic works with clear themes, complete structures, and reflecting major contradictions and conflicts as the "god of theme," "god of structure," and "god of conflict," attacking them as "frameworks and restrictions" that bound the hands and feet of artists, and added a charge of hindering the creation of "a new generation."
    Qu Baiyin first shouted to break the "god of theme." He attacked our demand for "prominent themes" in our works, which would "strip the image bare"; he attacked our demand for clear and definite themes, which would "exclude all works with profound and far-reaching meanings." What strange logic! Can the image be full if the theme is not prominent? Can the work be "profound and far-reaching" if the theme is not clear and definite? No, the drunkard's intention is not in the wine. Qu Baiyin himself said: "There are no literary and artistic works that do not express any ideas." It can be seen that what he deeply hates is not all themes and ideas, but only the so-called "clichés," that is, opposing the expression of the theme of revolutionary struggle in literary and artistic works and propagating the ideas of the proletariat. Qu Baiyin demanded that the works express another so-called "new idea," that is, the idea of "removing clichés in thought and expressing unique insights on life," the idea of "seeing what others have not seen and saying what others have not said." What else could this so-called "unique insight" that is anti-Mao Zedong Thought, this "new idea" that the revolutionary people "have not seen" and "have not said" be, except the broken and rotten things of the bourgeoisie and revisionism?
    Qu Baiyin continued to shout to break the "god of structure." He opposed socialist films "stories must have a beginning and an end and be clearly explained," and opposed works "explaining the times and explaining the situation." He attacked with the most vicious language, saying: "This magic of the god of structure has unexpected effects—the blind can understand it, the deaf can understand it, but those who are neither blind nor deaf are not interested in it." Qu Baiyin not only tried his best to uglified our revolutionary literary and artistic works here, insulting the workers, peasants, and soldiers as "blind" and "deaf," but also directly attacked Chairman Mao's instructions on popularizing literature and art and creating literature and art that the masses like to see and hear. Did Qu Baiyin need any artistic "structure" at all? No, what he vigorously advocated was another kind of "new artistic conception." He promoted what writers should use "imagination" to "artistic process life" and create "attractive situations." What kind of "artistic conception" is this again? To put it bluntly, it is to express anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas and the bourgeois world view through various artistic forms, so that the ideology of all exploiting classes can run rampant and carry out a "digging heart war" against the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the mystery of Qu Baiyin's great destruction of the "god of structure."
    Qu Baiyin also had a magic weapon, which is the so-called breaking of the "god of conflict," opposing the works "reflecting the main contradictions." In our view, the main contradiction that literature and art should first reflect is the struggle between the two classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Only in this way can we better exert the fighting role of literature and art in promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie. In fact, Qu Baiyin's attack on the "god of conflict" is just to oppose literature and art reflecting the contradictions and conflicts between the two classes and the two roads. What he wants to reflect is another kind of conflict, that is, exposing the so-called "shadows," that is, the "dark side," of socialist society, describing the troubles caused by trivial matters around him, portraying the so-called "inner contradictions" of heroic characters, expressing love, wind, flowers, snow, and moon, and love field storms, etc… so that literature and art will be reduced to a tool for propagating capitalist ideas.
    Qu Baiyin's so-called "breaking of the three gods" is the three poisonous arrows he shot at Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, and it is also the concretization of the revisionist literary proposition of the film industry gang's "deviation from the classics and rebellion." Stripping away the painted skin, his "Sima Zhao's heart" [司马昭之心 - ulterior motive] will be clear to the world.
          Creating Biographies for Demons and Monsters, Opposing the Shaping of Proletarian Heroic Figures
    The "Liberation Army Daily" editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution" said: "Singing praises to that class, shaping the heroic figures of that class, and which class's figures occupy a dominant position in literary and artistic works is the focus of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the literary and artistic front, and is the dividing line between the literature and art of different classes." On this issue, Qu Baiyin is once again singing a duet with us.
    Qu Baiyin put forward his own principles of shaping characters in "Innovation Monologue": "Heroic figures are not always and everywhere with chest and belly protruding, eyes wide open; evil villains are not always and everywhere with rat eyes, jackal heads, and bared teeth." At the Second Shanghai Municipal Literary and Art Congress, he further attacked the so-called "rules and regulations" of revolutionary literary and artistic works: "Determine the characters, the positive characters are the Party branch secretary or the poor peasants, the negative characters are the rich peasants and the well-to-do middle peasants; determine the story, the story is that the positive characters support the commune and the negative characters destroy the commune." Here, Qu Baiyin's meaning is very clear: "Heroic figures" should be uglified; "evil villains" should be beautified. Positive characters should not all be Party branch secretaries or poor peasants who support the commune; negative characters should not all be rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants who destroy the commune. What is this? This is clearly to reverse the enemy and us, to confuse the positive and negative characters, to uglified the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to beautify the demons and monsters in literary and artistic works! At the conference, he also "spoke out injustice" for the film "Everlasting City," clamoring to let capitalists and bourgeois intellectuals appear on the socialist screen as positive images, fighting for the status and continuing the genealogy for the exploiting classes.
    Qu Baiyin's reactionary theory has been practiced by him in his creative practice. In the film "Red Sun," the company commander of the People's Liberation Army, Shi Donggen, was written like a bandit, with "rat eyes, jackal heads, and bared teeth"; while Zhang Lingfu, the Kuomintang executioner whose hands were stained with the blood of the people, was portrayed as dignified, unyielding, and fully expressing the demeanor of a "true soldier" as Qu Baiyin praised. Isn't Qu Baiyin constantly advocating the shaping of so-called "new images"? It turns out that this is the "new image" he needs!
    Chairman Mao said: "If you are a bourgeois literary artist, you will not sing praises to the proletariat but sing praises to the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian literary artist, you will not sing praises to the bourgeoisie but sing praises to the proletariat and the working people: one of the two must be chosen." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") Qu Baiyin was intoxicated with singing praises, writing biographies and erecting monuments for the bourgeois reactionary figures, demons, and monsters, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, which completely exposed him as a bourgeois reactionary literary artist.
          Adhering to the Bourgeois World View, Confronting the Literary and Art Path of Integration with Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    Qu Baiyin's "Innovation Monologue" attempts to further induce literary and artistic workers to become tools of revisionism, detach themselves from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, resist ideological transformation, and embark on the bourgeois path.
    Chairman Mao has always taught us: Literary and artistic workers "must shift their standpoint, must gradually shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, in the process of going deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, going deep into actual struggles, and in the process of studying Marxism and studying society." ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") Therefore, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transforming the world view is the only broadest and most correct path for revolutionary literary and artistic workers.
    In "Innovation Monologue," Qu Baiyin put forward a whole set of reactionary propositions that are diametrically opposed to the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. He prescribed a series of "innovation" prescriptions for literary and artistic workers: what "broad observation," "broadening artistic horizons," practicing "basic skills," buying "skills," establishing one's own "original" style, … and so on. It is said that as long as you do this, you can create "masterpieces" of "a new generation."
    Qu Baiyin fundamentally opposed writers and artists going deep into life, integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and fundamentally opposed writers and artists transforming their world views. In "Innovation Monologue," he persuaded literary and artistic workers to "refuse all social activities, think hard behind closed doors, and sometimes even don't bother to read the newspaper," "must come up with something new." How to do it? His proposition is that writers and artists should "know themselves, discover themselves, and present themselves" in their works. In August 1962, he wrote another article under the pseudonym "Yan Kefeng," even encouraging playwrights to "create something out of nothing" when creating!
    This is a thorough bourgeois reactionary literary path. What "thinking hard behind closed doors" and what "creating something out of nothing" are completely thorough reactionary subjective idealism! What "discovering oneself" and what "presenting oneself" are no different from the "subjective fighting spirit" and "self-expansion" of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng! Qu Baiyin wanted literary and artistic workers to adhere to the bourgeois world view, stubbornly express themselves, and transform the Party and the world according to the bourgeois face.
    He also viciously provoked the relationship between literary and artistic workers and the Party. He said: "Artistic achievements are difficult to obtain through the arrangements of others." This is insidious instigation! He wanted literary and artistic workers to resist the instructions of the Party, not to listen to the "arrangements" of the Party, not to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, not to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not to be guided by the Marxist-Leninist world view, and to "think hard behind closed doors" and go their own way. The path he advocated is the path against Mao Zedong Thought, the path against the Party, and the path of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. And Qu Baiyin himself is the "leading sheep" walking on this road!
　　A Trumpeter of the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Line
    After clamoring for "breaking clichés" and "breaking the three gods," Qu Baiyin also vigorously advocated "establishing the three new"—"new ideas," "new images," and "new artistic conceptions." In fact, his so-called "three new" are not "innovative" things at all, but all broken things picked up from the garbage heap of the bourgeoisie, modern revisionism, and literary art of the 1930s. Qu Baiyin is the trumpeter of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the literary art world!
    Qu Baiyin fell to his knees before bourgeois literature and art. He said what "a surge of film art innovation is now sweeping the world" and questioned why we are "standing still" and "why don't we need innovation"? What are the so-called "innovative surges" "within the world" that Qu Baiyin said? They are nothing more than the American "Beat Generation," the British "Angry Young Men," the French "New Wave," and so on. Qu Baiyin wanted our socialist films to take the films of imperialism and capitalism as examples to learn from and goals to pursue. He worshiped certain films in capitalist countries that obliterated class struggle, beautified the capitalist system, and expressed the humble feelings of small people, and recommended them everywhere, serving as voluntary propagandists. He touted these films, which reflected the most decadent, declining, and corrupt ideas of the bourgeoisie, as works that "emitted new light" and "won the hearts of the world." He even openly praised American films, calling them works of creating "a new generation." At the Second Shanghai Municipal Literary and Art Congress, he openly declared in front of thousands of listeners that the "themes and subjects of capitalist films are exactly what our films lack," and these themes are "still urgently needed" "for the broad masses of people." This fully confirmed that Qu Baiyin is a loyal slave to the culture of imperialism and capitalism.
    Qu Baiyin fell to his knees before modern revisionist literature and art. He wanted our socialist films to embark on the path of revisionism. We know that Soviet revisionist films serve Khrushchev's revisionist politics and are a counter-revolutionary tool for promoting the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union to capitalism. The "Soviet New Wave" represented by Chukhrai attacked Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as "dogmatism" and "old-fashioned," and wanted to use so-called "new concepts" to "innovate." They raised the black banner of "innovation" and shot a large number of films such as "The Fate of a Man," "And Quiet Flows the Don," "The Forty-First," "Ballad of a Soldier," "Clear Skies," and "The Cranes Are Flying," promoting the revisionist political line, slandering the proletarian dictatorship, viciously attacking Stalin, speaking for counter-revolutionaries and traitors, and preaching pacifism, humanitarianism, and individualism. These films are bloodless executioners and enemies of the revolutionary people without guns. Our proletarian films are irreconcilable with them. However, Qu Baiyin used the name of "film is a comparable art" to ask us to "compare" with revisionist films and to actively join the revisionist "innovation surge" and "compete" with such counter-revolutionary films. Qu Baiyin not only praised revisionist films in words but also actively instigated others to "watch" them in large numbers; he also encouraged a director to record the shots of the revisionist "good" films as learning materials. This proves that Qu Baiyin, who advocated so-called "innovation," and the revisionists in the Soviet film industry who advocated so-called "reform" are completely jackals of the same lair!
    Qu Baiyin fell to his knees before the literature and art of the 1930s. He wanted socialist films to take the films of the 1930s as learning models. In "Innovation Monologue," he shamelessly touted the 1930s as an era of "vigorous innovation" in film; "Works with new ideas, new images, and new artistic conceptions surged to the screen like a turbulent spring tide." And he threatened us: if we do not inherit this so-called "tradition" and "kick over all the achievements of our predecessors," we will "get half the results with twice the effort."
    As everyone knows, the left-wing literary and art movement (including the film movement) in the 1930s was politically Wang Ming's opportunist line, organizationally closed-doorism and sectarianism, and the literary and art ideology was actually the ideology of Russian bourgeois literary critics of the 19th century. The films of the 1930s reflected the bourgeois human nature theory, humanitarianism, and individualism, what was expressed was the beautified exploiting class elements and the uglified image of the workers and peasants, and what was fabricated was the absurd and unbelievable romance plus the bizarre plot of "revolution." Isn't this the old trick that bourgeois artists have already written rotten? What is this considered "creating a new generation"? Qu Baiyin actually dressed up such films as representatives of "new ideas," "new images," and "new artistic conceptions" and used this as a model for the "innovation" of socialist films. Isn't this to make the socialist films of the 1960s embark on the old road of capitalist films of the 1930s?
    It can be seen from this that Qu Baiyin's purpose in praising bourgeois films, modern revisionist films, and films of the 1930s is to make us and them "combine into one." At the Second Shanghai Municipal Literary and Art Congress, he said without concealment: "Black cats and花 cats, the one who can catch mice is a good cat. I think this can also be said for film creation. What to write and how to write are all welcome, as long as it can move people and give people a beneficial ideological influence, rather than teach people, it is a good film." What he said about "giving people a beneficial ideological influence" is, to put it bluntly, giving people a bourgeois ideological influence. In order to spread this influence, he advocated "touching people" and capturing the audience emotionally; and opposed "teaching people," opposing educating the people with proletarian ideas.
    The fact is indeed so. Under the instigation of this black line trumpeter, a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds were released in the Shanghai film industry: "North Country Jiangnan," "Red Sun," "Two Stage Sisters," "Ashima," "Fan." This is not enough, in the film program planning, also listed "Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics", "Drama Spring and Autumn" ...; From Tang Minghuang, Li Xiucheng, to the American imperialist molecule Stuart Lei, the film actor of the 1930s Ruan Lingyu, etc., they all prepared to move on to the screen. We can imagine, if these emperors, generals, reactionary lackeys, foreigners, and dead people so massively occupy our film front, disseminating capitalist ideological toxins every moment, will our youth not become the successors of the bourgeoisie, our country will not change color?
    Qu Baiyin was not satisfied with this batch of anti-Party and anti-socialist "shells," and he carefully planned to make their counter-revolutionary program have legal effect. In the second half of 1961, he presided over the formulation of the "Opinions on the Review of Art Films and the Trial Implementation Regulations for the Review of Screenplay Sample Films" in the Shanghai Municipal Film Bureau. In order to mobilize the so-called "enthusiasm" of bourgeois intellectuals against the Party and socialism, he stipulated in the regulations that it is necessary to "maximize the initiative, enthusiasm and originality of the creative staff"; In order to eliminate class struggle and allow demons and monsters to release poison at will, and politically disarm us, he stipulated in the regulations: "When it is difficult to distinguish whether it is a political, ideological, or artistic issue, it should be treated as an artistic issue for the time being"; In order to abolish the leadership of the Party and hand over the seal of power to the bourgeois "experts", he stipulated in the regulations: "Director's interpretation is not subject to review," "rehearsal is not subject to review," stage sample films "do not ask outsiders to watch", and bureau and factory leaders "should notify the director when watching sample films."
    In coordination with this counter-revolutionary political line and literary line, Qu Baiyin further formulated his organizational line. In order to expand his forces, he arbitrarily implemented "director grading", and included many directors who were right-wing molecules, historical counter-revolutionary molecules, and bad molecules into the high-end level of "completing two independent film shoots within five years". In this way, he gathered these people to his command and regarded them as his pawns to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Qu Baiyin understood that it was not enough to have a group of "loyal" artistic creators to complete his counter-revolutionary undertaking, and he must also control a group of "loyal" management personnel to change the management system. In the second half of 1962, Qu Baiyin successively convened four so-called "old artist symposiums" in the Shanghai film system. This was a series of thorough black conferences. The so-called "old artists" who participated in the conference included past capitalists, bank managers, theater owners, contractors, and directors who had consistently made pornographic films before liberation, etc., which were really colorful

    瞿白音的《创新独白》是电影界黑帮的反革命纲领
　　丁学雷
    编者按：丁学雷同志这篇文章，揭发和批判了一株大毒草《关于电影创新问题的独白》，希望大家认真读一读。
    这株大毒草的作者瞿白音，是一个反动的资产阶级文人、电影界黑帮的头目之一、反动影片《红日》的编剧者。他在这篇“独白”里，说什么“创新”，什么“去陈言”，什么“破三神”等等，统统是反革命的黑话。他的这篇所谓“独白”，实际上并不是他一个人的“独白”，而是电影界一伙黑帮分子，串通一气合伙制造出来的一项“重要文件”。这个“文件”是夏衍的“离经叛道论”的具体化，是电影界黑帮分子们的反革命纲领，是公开号召文艺界的牛鬼蛇神们夺取我们的文艺阵地、实行资本主义复辟的反革命宣言书。他们的这个宣言书，说穿了，就是要让他们痛痛快快大干一场，挥舞起他们反革命的笔杆子，进一步夺取他们梦寐以求的印把子，以便对我国工人阶级和广大劳动人民实行资产阶级专政。他们咬牙切齿，把锋芒对准无产阶级专政，对准伟大的毛泽东思想。
    读了丁学雷同志这篇文章所揭露出来的材料，使我们不能不触目惊心，义愤填膺。毛主席教导我们，一些反革命分子，“他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”我们应该牢记毛主席的话，擦亮眼睛，提高警惕。那些曾经认为“秀才造不了反”的糊涂人，应该清醒过来，积极地投入到这场文化大革命的行列里来！
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，战斗前进！把隐藏在各个角落的黑帮分子，统统揪出来。把所有的反革命黑帮，彻底打垮。一切牛鬼蛇神，都将被革命的雷霆打得粉碎！
    十几年来，一根反党反社会主义的黑线从上而下地统治着整个电影界。
    在每一次大规模的阶级斗争风浪中，电影界总有一批反党的“英雄好汉”挺身而出，为一切反动势力打先锋。一九五六年，冒出了一个钟惦棐，大敲了一阵电影“锣鼓”，粉墨登场，揭开了资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的序幕。一九六二年，电影界又跳出了一个瞿白音，张牙舞爪，念念有词，刮起了一股“创新”的妖风，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。
    《关于电影创新问题的独白》（发表于《电影艺术》一九六二年第三期，以下简称《创新独白》），是一个疯狂反对毛泽东思想的文艺纲领，是一个疯狂反对无产阶级专政的政治纲领。瞿白音不但是一个反动的修正主义文人，而且是一个彻头彻尾的个人野心家。他窃踞了上海市电影局副局长的领导岗位，秉承着电影界黑帮头目的旨意，竭力推行他们的反革命行动纲领。所谓《创新独白》，其实根本不是什么“独白”，而是电影界一小撮黑帮的“合唱”。他们在电影界实行反革命的专政，贯彻资产阶级的即修正主义的文艺路线，为
  “和平演变”的反动政策效劳。
    彻底揭露并批判瞿白音的《创新独白》，彻底揭露并批判电影界修正主义黑帮，不仅是关系到社会主义电影事业前途的大事，也是关系到我们整个国家命运和前途的大事。
      一个反革命的政治纲领
    瞿白音的《创新独白》是电影界黑帮反革命阴谋的一次集中大暴露。
    在《创新独白》中，瞿白音摆出一副“打手”的凶相，流露出对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨。他借“创新”为名，疯狂攻击毛泽东思想，疯狂攻击社会主义制度，疯狂攻击党的领导。
          以“去陈言”为名，疯狂攻击毛泽东思想
    瞿白音和国内外的一切阶级敌人一样，首先把攻击的矛头指向无产阶级和劳动人民的命根子——毛泽东思想。他诬蔑毛泽东思想是“陈言”，公开叫喊要“去陈言”。
    瞿白音说：“电影虽是最年轻的艺术，但也已经有了陈言充斥的情况。”他捏造了“主题之神”、“结构之神”、“冲突之神”的所谓“罪恶”，然后咬牙切齿地说：“诸神各显神威，满天撒下应该怎样、不应该怎样的各种符箓和咒语。在诸神合力交攻之下，艺术家只得束手束脚，抱头觅路。而陈言，是唯一的逋逃薮。”所谓“陈言”，他在文章里说得十分明白，就是“经典著作中讲过千百次的话”，就是“文件指示”，就是“众所周知的思想”，一言以蔽之，瞿白音所攻击的“陈言”，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想！
    瞿白音对毛泽东思想恨之入骨，他以“破陈言”为名，恶毒地诬蔑毛泽东思想“缺乏新意”，“被历史的尘土淹没了”。这完全是即将“被历史的尘土淹没”的资产阶级代表人物的狂言乱语。他的阶级本能驱使他站出来泼口大骂，攻击毛泽东思想是“符箓”，是“咒语”，“有了神灵的呵护”。好熟悉的语言！胡风反革命分子辱骂毛泽东思想是“五把刀子”，瞿白音来一个“创新”，攻击毛泽东思想是“符箓”、“咒语”！胡风反革命分子诬蔑毛泽东思想是原始民族顶礼膜拜的“图腾”，瞿白音又来一个“创新”，毒骂毛泽东思想有什么“神灵的呵护”。你们是一个巢穴里的货色，你们的反革命语言如出一辙，你们对毛泽东思想的疯狂攻击也毫无二致。
    瞿白音不但自己疯狂地攻击毛泽东思想，并且煽动文艺界的牛鬼蛇神一同来反对毛泽东思想。在《创新独白》中，他号召电影界的资产阶级分子鼓起“勇气”，“坚持真理，冲锋陷阵”，和“陈言”作斗争。在一九六二年上海市第二次文代大会的讲台上，他更唾沫四溅，要人们“激发我们自己对于陈言的痛切之感。……痛感以后，我们就可以有决心，有雄心来去陈言”。他不但在理论上“破陈言”，即攻击毛泽东思想，而且在行动上以自己的“创新”之作《红日》来“破陈言”，他在编写电影剧本的时候，别人给他提了意见，要他在作品里表现毛泽东思想，他破口大骂：“放屁！”并且声势汹汹地说：“我不接受你们的意见，因为这样写不成戏。”这就彻底暴露了他的反革命嘴脸。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是中国人民革命和社会主义建设的最高指针，是反对帝国主义的强大的精神原子弹，是反对现代修正主义的最有力的思想武器。对于一切阶级敌人来说，毛泽东思想的确是锋利无比的刀子，对于革命人民来说，却是绝不可少的灵魂和方向盘。它永远不会“过时”，它是一轮永远不落的红太阳，以其真理的万丈光芒永远照耀着世界！
    一切阶级敌人极端仇恨毛泽东思想，是十分自然的。然而，狂犬吠日，又何损于太阳的光辉！牛鬼蛇神纵能嚣张一时，而在太阳的万丈光芒照射之下，必将“被历史的尘土淹没”。瞿白音之流岂能例外！
          猖狂反对无产阶级专政，
      妄想实现资产阶级“一元化领导”
    在《创新独白》中，瞿白音向读者提了一个煽动性的题目：“现在世界范围内正在掀起一个电影艺术创新的热潮，为什么我们就不需要创新？不能创新？现在细细一想，似乎有点明白了。”瞿白音究竟明白了什么？通观全篇，答案是不难找到的，这就是：“习惯势力是不能低估的。”他还假借别人之口，愤愤地说：“什么‘创新’！太阳底下没有新事物！”这是瞿白音的黑话。把它翻译出来，无非是说：在社会主义制度的“习惯势力”之下，在无产阶级专政的“太阳底下”，不可能有“新事物”，也谈不上什么“创新”。
    在瞿白音的笔下，我们社会的政治气候被描绘成乍暖还寒，阴森逼人，“已经过了清明，还这么冷”。他以其“独特的艺术构思”塑造了一个“穿着厚呢大衣”的“朋友”的形象。这位“朋友”，“对新事物特别谨慎小心”，在座谈会上“说话时不断眨眼睛、咽唾沫”，象个小媳妇似的，不敢畅所欲言，一副可怜相。
    瞿白音把我们的社会主义制度描绘得如此“不自由”，把无产阶级专政形容得如此“阴森恐怖”，仍嫌不满足，他在上海市第二次文代大会上，还公然发出了反共的叫嚣：“近年来，真话是极可贵的。一位著名的演员，是党员，曾经在酒后说过一句话，他说他很想见毛主席，请求发一块牌牌，上面写一个‘免’字，就是免除‘斗’，让他想说什么就说什么。可见有许多人想说真话。”看，瞿白音对无产阶级专政的攻击，到了何等猖狂的地步！瞿白音妄图假借什么“名演员”、“党员”之口，向党讨一块“免斗”牌，这是在玩弄阴谋：只许他们向党、向社会主义制度猖狂进攻，不许革命人民进行还击。我们要正告瞿白音：你别痴心梦想，革命人民发给了你“免斗”牌，就是放弃了自己专政的印把子，解除了自己的武装。有了你们的“自由”，就没有了我们的自由，我们和你们的斗争，是你死我活的搏斗！对于象你们这样的反革命的修正主义分子，就是不能讲民主，只能用专政。我们和你们的矛盾，是革命与反革命的矛盾。对于革命的敌人，毛主席早就说过，就是要“实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。”（《论人民民主专政》）
    瞿白音攻击社会主义制度、攻击无产阶级专政的根本目的，是要推翻党的领导，是要夺权，是要让反党反社会主义的黑线专我们的政。在《创新独白》中，他肆意丑化我们党的领导：“领导者对人也并非都含笑拍肩，论阴阳如反掌。”在上海电影创作座谈会上，他又用最肮脏、最卑鄙的语言来咒骂党的领导，说什么“从思想上的主观、片面到作风上的简单、粗暴；从以个人好恶强加于人，到出言不逊，恶语伤人，不学无术而又指手划脚。真是洋广杂货，一应俱全，花色繁多，不及备载。”这是多么刻骨的阶级仇恨。
    在瞿白音看来，党的领导的“罪恶”简直太多了，他捏造了许多“罪状”之后，终于露出了他的狼子野心。他声势汹汹地宣称“要改进领导”，他威胁我们党，不这样，就会“受到惩罚”。如何“改进领导”呢？他在《创新独白》里指桑骂槐地劝党的领导：“干不需要想象的工作是否会适合些呢？”这是明目张胆地要党下台！党下台的话，谁上台呢？瞿白音又发布命令：“赋予导演以应有的权力”，实现“导演在摄制组的一元化领导”。在这里，瞿白音讲的让导演来“领导”，实际上就是让资产阶级分子掌握电影事业的大权！至于党下台以后又干些什么呢？他在电影创作座谈会上公然提出：党的领导可以做一个“园丁”，和“炊事员”一起，
  “侍候”好“放花人”——也就是他们那一帮资产阶级的即修正主义的文艺家，去大放反党反社会主义的毒草。请看，这就是瞿白音的“变天”计划！他的
  “变天”计划，比之一切右派分子的“轮流做庄”的反革命主张还要彻底。他们想要永远坐在“领导”岗位上，要共产党听从他们的指挥，永远做这些资产阶级老爷们的奴仆。这是他们的反革命的如意算盘。
    瞿白音的胃口也未免太大了！他如同一切敌对阶级分子一样，总是过高地估计了自己的力量，过低地估计了无产阶级和劳动人民的力量。瞿白音们听着：撼山易，撼毛泽东思想、撼无产阶级专政、撼共产党的领导难！你们这几只“蚂蚁”，几头“跛驴”，不自量力，妄想改变无产阶级和一切劳动人民的江山，结果只能被历史的车轮碾得粉碎！
      一个修正主义的文艺纲领
    文艺为工农兵服务的方向，文艺工作者与工农兵相结合的道路，是毛泽东思想的一个光辉的、重要的组成部分，是马克思列宁主义文艺理论的新发展和最高峰，也是资产阶级文艺和修正主义文艺最害怕最仇恨的东西。因此，文艺界的一切反党反社会主义分子总是把攻击的矛头对准毛泽东文艺思想。瞿白音在《创新独白》中提出的一整套资产阶级文艺纲领，其目的就在于篡改文艺的工农兵方向和工农兵道路：他以破“三神”为名，妄图把社会主义电影事业改造成为资本主义电影事业；他以树立“新的形象”为名，反对塑造工农兵英雄形象，蓄意为牛鬼蛇神立传树碑；他以提倡艺术家的“博观”、“基本功”、“风格”、“想象”为由，妄图诱使文艺工作者拒绝自我改造、脱离工农兵，走上资产阶级的即修正主义的道路。
       以“破三神”为名，反对为工农兵服务的文艺方向
    瞿白音在《创新独白》中，把革命文艺作品具有鲜明的主题、完整的结构、反映重大的矛盾冲突，咒骂为“主题之神”“结构之神”“冲突之神”，攻击它们是束缚艺术家手脚的“框框条条”，给它们加上一个妨害创“一代之新”的罪名。
    瞿白音首先叫嚷要破“主题之神”。他攻击我们要求作品“主题突出”，就会“把形象剥得精光”；攻击我们要求主题清楚、明确，就会“排斥一切义深意远的作品”。真是奇怪的逻辑！难道主题不突出，形象就能够丰满吗？主题不清楚、不明确，作品就能“义深意远”吗？不，醉翁之意不在酒。瞿白音自己也说：“不表达任何思想的文艺作品是没有的”，可见，他深恶痛绝的不是所有的主题思想，他反对的只是所谓“陈言”，也就是反对文艺作品表现革命斗争的主题，宣传无产阶级的思想。瞿白音要求作品表现另一种所谓“新的思想”，那就是“去除思想上的陈言，对生活表示独特的见解”的思想，是“见人之所未见，言人之所未言”的思想。这种反毛泽东思想的所谓“独特的见解”，这种革命人民“所未见”、“所未言”的“新的思想”，除了是资产阶级、修正主义的那一套破烂而外，还能够是些什么货色呢？
    瞿白音继续叫嚷要破“结构之神”。他反对社会主义的电影“故事必须有头有尾交代清楚”，反对作品“交代时代，说明形势”，他以最恶毒的语言攻击说：“结构之神的这种法术，有意想不到的效果——盲者可以听懂，聋者可以看懂，但不盲不聋者却对之兴趣索然。”瞿白音在这里不仅竭力丑化我们的革命文艺作品，辱骂工农群众为“盲者”、“聋者”，并且直接攻击毛主席关于文艺的大众化和创造为群众所喜闻乐见的文艺的指示。瞿白音难道不需要任何艺术“结构”了吗？不，他大力鼓吹的是另外一种“新的艺术构思”，他宣扬什么作家要运用“想象”“对生活作艺术加工”，创造“引人入胜的情境”。这又是一种什么“艺术构思”呢？拆穿了说，就是把反党反社会主义的思想，把资产阶级的世界观，通过各种各样的艺术形式表现出来，让一切剥削阶级的意识形态大肆泛滥，对工农兵群众进行“挖心战”，这便是瞿白音大破“结构之神”的谜底。
    瞿白音还有一个法宝就是所谓破“冲突之神”，反对作品“反映主要矛盾”。在我们看来，文艺首先应该反映的主要矛盾，是无产阶级与资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争。只有这样，才能更好地发挥文艺的兴无灭资的战斗作用。其实，瞿白音攻击“冲突之神”，只不过是反对文艺反映两个阶级、两条道路的矛盾冲突。他要反映的是另一种冲突，那就是暴露社会主义社会的所谓“阴影”即“阴暗面”，描写身边琐事所引起的烦恼，刻划英雄人物的所谓“内心矛盾”，表现风花雪月、情场风波等等……，从而使文艺沦为宣传资本主义思想的工具。
    瞿白音的所谓“破三神”，是他射向毛泽东文艺路线的三支毒箭，也是电影界黑帮“离经叛道”的修正主义文艺主张的具体化。剥去画皮，他的“司马昭之心”就大白于天下了。
          为牛鬼蛇神立传，反对塑造无产阶级英雄人物
    《解放军报》社论《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗积极参加社会主义文化大革命》中说：“歌颂那一个阶级，塑造那一个阶级的英雄人物，那一个阶级的人物在文艺作品中居于统治地位，是文艺战线上无产阶级同资产阶级之间阶级斗争的焦点，是区分不同阶级文艺的界线。”在这个问题上，瞿白音又和我们大唱对台戏。
    瞿白音在《创新独白》中提出了他自己的塑造人物的原则：“英雄人物并非都随时随地挺胸凸肚、怒目圆睁；奸恶之徒也并非都鼠目獐头、呲牙咧嘴”。在上海市第二次文代大会上，他又进一步攻击革命文艺作品的所谓“条条框框”：“定出人物，正面人物是党支部书记或贫农，反面人物是富农、富裕中农；定出故事，故事是正面人物拥护公社和反面人物破坏公社。”在这里，瞿白音的意思很明白：“英雄人物”要加以丑化；“奸恶之徒”要加以美化。正面人物不要都是拥护公社的党支部书记或贫农；反面人物也不要都是破坏公社的富农、富裕中农。这是什么话？这明明是要我们在文艺作品中颠倒敌我，混淆正反面人物，丑化工农兵，美化牛鬼蛇神！在大会上，他还为影片《不夜城》“鸣不平”，叫嚷要让资本家、资产阶级知识分子作为正面形象登上社会主义银幕，为剥削阶级争地位，续家谱。
    瞿白音的这种反动理论已经由他在创作实践中身体力行了。影片《红日》中，人民解放军的连长石东根被写成跟土匪一样，“鼠目獐头，呲牙咧嘴”；而双手沾满人民鲜血的国民党刽子手张灵甫，却被刻划得仪态大方、坚贞不屈，充分表现了如瞿白音所夸奖的是“真正的军人”的风度。瞿白音不是一味鼓吹要塑造所谓“新的形象”吗？原来这就是他所需要的“新的形象”！
    毛主席说：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）瞿白音醉心于为资产阶级反动人物、牛鬼蛇神、地富反坏歌功颂德，立传树碑，彻底暴露了他是一个资产阶级的反动文艺家。
          坚持资产阶级世界观，对抗与工农兵相结合的文艺道路
    瞿白音的《创新独白》企图进一步诱使文艺工作者沦为修正主义的工具，脱离工农兵，抗拒思想改造，走上资产阶级的道路。
    毛主席一贯教导我们：文艺工作者“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）因此，活学活用毛主席著作，和工农兵相结合，改造世界观，这是革命文艺工作者唯一最宽广、最正确的道路。
    在《创新独白》中，瞿白音提出了和毛主席所指出的道路针锋相对的一整套反动主张，他为文艺工作者开出了一系列“创新”的药方：什么“博观”呀，“开阔艺术眼界”呀，练“基本功”呀，买“技巧”呀，树立自己“独创”的风格呀，……等等。据说，只要照此办理，就能创作出什么“一代之新”的“杰作”来。
    瞿白音根本反对作家、艺术家深入生活，和工农兵相结合，根本反对作家、艺术家改造自己的世界观，他在《创新独白》里劝诱文艺工作者要“谢绝了一切社会活动，闭门苦思，有时候连报纸都懒得看”，“一定要搞一个新东西出来”。怎么搞法呢？他的主张是要作家、艺术家在作品里“认识自己，发现自己，呈现自己”。一九六二年八月他又化名“颜可风”写了一篇文章，竟鼓动剧作家们在创作时要“无中生有”！
    这是一条地地道道的资产阶级的反动文艺道路。什么“闭门苦思”，什么“无中生有”，完全是彻头彻尾的反动的主观唯心主义！什么“发现自己”，什么“呈现自己”，这和反革命分子胡风的“主观战斗精神”的“自我扩张”有什么两样！瞿白音就是要文艺工作者坚持资产阶级的世界观，顽强地表现自己，按照资产阶级的面貌来改造党，改造世界。
    他还恶毒地挑唆文艺工作者和党的关系，他说：“艺术的成就，是很难由别人的安排来获得的。”这是阴险的煽动！他要文艺工作者对抗党的指示，不听从党的“安排”，不去活学活用毛主席著作，不要与工农兵结合，不要以马列主义的世界观为指导，一心“闭门苦思”，走自己的路。他提倡的这条道路，就是反毛泽东思想的道路，反党的道路，资产阶级的和修正主义的道路。而瞿白音自己，就是走在这条道路上的“带头羊”！
　　一个反党反社会主义黑线的吹鼓手
    瞿白音大肆叫嚷“破陈言”、“破三神”之后，又大肆鼓吹“立三新”——“新的思想”、“新的形象”、“新的艺术构思”。其实，他的所谓“三新”，一点也不是什么“创新”的货色，全是从资产阶级、现代修正主义和三十年代文艺的垃圾堆里拣出来的破烂。瞿白音是文艺界反党反社会主义黑线的吹鼓手！
    瞿白音拜倒在资产阶级文艺的脚下。他说什么“现在世界范围内正在掀起一个电影艺术创新的热潮”，责问我们为什么“裹足不前”，“为什么我们就不需要创新”？瞿白音所谓“世界范围内”的“创新热潮”是些什么玩意儿呢？无非就是美国的“垮掉的一代”、英国的“愤怒的青年”、法国的“新浪潮”，等等。瞿白音要我们社会主义的电影以帝国主义、资本主义的电影作为学习的榜样，追求的目标。他对资本主义国家某些抹杀阶级斗争、美化资本主义制度、表现小人物的卑微感情的影片，崇拜得五体投地，到处推荐，做义务宣传员。他把这些反映了资产阶级最颓废、没落、腐朽的思想的影片，吹捧为“发射了新的光芒”，“赢得世界人心”的作品。他甚至公开吹捧美国影片，称之为创“一代之新”的作品。在上海市第二次文代大会上，他当着上千个听众的面，公然宣称资本主义影片的“题材和主题正是我们影片所缺乏的”，这些主题“对于广大人民来说”，“仍然迫切需要”。这充分证实了瞿白音是一个帝国主义、资本主义文化的忠实奴才。
    瞿白音拜倒在现代修正主义文艺的脚下。他要我们的社会主义的电影走上修正主义的道路。我们知道，苏联修正主义电影是为赫鲁晓夫修正主义政治服务，促使苏联向资本主义“和平演变”的一个反革命工具。以丘赫莱依为代表的“苏联新浪潮”派，攻击马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想是“教条主义”、“老一套”，要用所谓“新概念”进行“革新”。他们打起了“创新”的黑旗，拍出了大批的象《一个人的命运》、《静静的顿河》、《第四十一个》、《士兵的颂歌》、《晴朗的天空》、《雁南飞》等影片，鼓吹修正主义政治路线，诬蔑无产阶级专政，恶毒地攻击斯大林，为反革命分子及叛徒张目，宣扬和平主义、人道主义和个人主义。这些影片是杀人不见血的刽子手，是革命人民的不拿枪的敌人。我们无产阶级的电影与它是势不两立的。可是，瞿白音却以“电影是可比的艺术”为名，要我们和修正主义影片去“比”，要我们的电影积极加入到修正主义的“创新热潮”中去，和这样的反革命影片“竞赛”。瞿白音不仅在口头上吹捧修正主义影片，而且积极唆使别人大量“观摩”；他还鼓励一个导演把修正主义的“好”片子的镜头纪录下来，作为学习资料。这就证明，提倡所谓“创新”的瞿白音，和提倡所谓“革新”的苏联电影界的修正主义者完全是一丘之貉！
    瞿白音拜倒在三十年代文艺的脚下。他要社会主义的电影以三十年代电影作为学习的典范。在《创新独白》中，他不知羞耻地把三十年代吹嘘为电影“蓬勃创新的时代”；“具有新的思想，新的形象和新的艺术构思的作品，象澎湃春潮，涌到银幕上”。并且吓唬我们：如果不继承这个所谓“传统”，“一脚踢翻前人一切成就”，就会“事倍功半”。
    大家知道，三十年代的左翼文艺运动（包括电影运动）政治上是王明的机会主义路线，组织上是关门主义和宗派主义，文艺思想实际上是十九世纪俄国资产阶级文艺评论家的思想。三十年代影片所反映的是资产阶级的人性论、人道主义、个人主义的思想，所表现的是美化了的剥削阶级分子和丑化了的工农的形象，所臆造的是荒诞不经的恋爱加“革命”的离奇情节。这不正是资产阶级艺术家早已写烂了的老套吗？这算是什么“创一代之新”呢？瞿白音居然把这样的电影打扮成“新的思想”、“新的形象”和“新的艺术构思”的代表，并以此作为社会主义电影“创新”的典范，这不是要六十年代的社会主义电影走上三十年代资本主义电影的老路上去吗？
    由此可见，瞿白音吹捧资产阶级电影、现代修正主义电影和三十年代电影的目的，是要我们和它们“合二而一”。在上海市第二次文代大会上，他毫不掩饰地说：“黑猫花猫，能捉到老鼠的就是好猫。我看对于电影创作也可以这样说，写什么，怎样写，都欢迎，只要能打动人，给人以有益的思想影响，而不是教训人，就是好片子。”他所讲的“给人以有益的思想影响”，说穿了，就是给人以资产阶级的思想影响。为了散布这种影响，他就鼓吹“打动人”，从感情上俘虏观众；而反对“教训人”，反对以无产阶级思想教育人民。
    事实果然如此。在这个黑线吹鼓手的怂恿之下，一大批反党反社会主义的毒草在上海电影界出笼了：《北国江南》、《红日》、《舞台姐妹》、《阿诗玛》、《球迷》等等。这还不算，他们在电影的剧目规划里，还列上了《扬州八怪》、《戏剧春秋》……；从什么唐明皇、李秀成，直到美帝国主义分子司徒雷登、三十年代电影演员阮玲玉，等等，他们统统准备搬上银幕。我们可以设想一下：假如让这些帝王将相、反动鹰犬、洋人死人如此大量占领我们的电影阵地，每时每刻地散布资本主义思想毒素的话，我们的青年不就会变成资产阶级的接班人，我们的国家不就要改变颜色了吗？
    瞿白音对这批反党反社会主义的“炮弹”感到还不满足，他又精心策划，使他们的反革命纲领具有法律的效力。一九六一年下半年，他在上海市电影局主持制订了《关于艺术片审查工作的意见和剧本样片审查试行条例》。为了调动资产阶级知识分子反党反社会主义的所谓“积极性”，他在条例中规定要“最大限度地发挥创作人员的主动性、积极性和首创精神”；为了取消阶级斗争，任凭牛鬼蛇神放毒，从政治上解除我们的武装，他在条例中规定：“难于区别其为政治的还是思想的、艺术的问题时，一律暂作艺术问题处理”；为了取消党的领导，把印把子交给资产阶级“专家”，他在条例中规定：“导演阐述不作审查”，“排演不作审查”，阶段样片“不请外界人看”，局厂领导“看样片时，应通知导演”。
    和这条反革命的政治路线、文艺路线相配合，瞿白音进一步制订他的组织路线。他为了扩大自己的势力，擅自实行“导演分档”，把很多右派分子、历史反革命分子、坏分子身份的导演，都列入了“五年内完成独立拍片两部”的高档。这样，他就把这些人搜罗到自己的麾下，作为他进行反革命复辟活动的爪牙。瞿白音懂得，光是有一批“忠心”的艺术创作人员还不能完成其反革命的大业，还必须掌握一批“忠心”的管理人员，改变经营管理制度。一九六二年下半年，瞿白音在上海电影系统连续召开了四次所谓“老艺人座谈会”。这是一系列地地道道的黑会，参加会议的所谓“老艺人”，有过去的资本家、银行经理、戏院老板、包工头，以及解放前一贯拍黄色影片的导演等等，真是五花八门，无奇不有。这些所谓“老艺人”，在瞿白音的一再鼓励下，果然“解除顾虑，畅所欲言”，发出一片“今不如昔”的叫嚣。他们肆无忌惮地攻击社会主义制度阻碍了电影事业的发展，攻击党的政治思想工作和人事制度。他们妄想把“人权”、“财权”夺到手，根据“票房价值”和“物质刺激”的原则办事，恢复一整套的资本主义经营管理制度。瞿白音等人一边紧锣密鼓地大开黑会，一边兴高采烈地将座谈会记录印发上报当时的文化部。文化部夏衍、陈荒煤等人大为赏识，备加赞扬，认为“这件工作做得很有意义”，并且立即以文化部的名义，将会议记录批转通报全国各电影厂，以资推广。
    瞿白音在这些牛鬼蛇神的策划下，在“祖师爷”的赞扬下，得意忘形，认为时机已经成熟，就抛出了成立“皮包公司”的主张。这个所谓“皮包公司”，实际上就是电影界黑帮日夜梦想的资本主义企业。瞿白音规定这个公司打着“公私合营”的招牌，拍摄影片
  “要另有一套办法，决不能象国内这样的工、农、青、妇法”；编剧、导演、演员“完全采取特约制”。这个恶毒的建议，就是要使社会主义的电影事业从根本上变质。瞿白音还提出“皮包公司”要为“海外或其他资本主义地区”服务，也就是更直接地为帝国主义、现代修正主义效劳。其实，这种黑公司，也不是瞿白音的“创新”之作，不过是三十年代资本主义电影企业的复活，现在，苏联现代修正主义“电影大师”在莫斯科已经创建了这样的“皮包公司”——“实验创作电影制片厂”。瞿白音计划中的“皮包公司”，不过是莫斯科“实验创作电影制片厂”的翻版而已！
    由此可见，瞿白音推行资产阶级、修正主义和三十年代的那一套反动货色，费尽心机，不遗余力。他不仅有一整套的反革命纲领，而且已经行动起来了！他完全不是“纸上谈兵”，而是已经专了我们的政！大敌当前，一切革命的人民行动起来，打倒这批反革命的修正主义分子！
      不是“独白”，而是“合唱”
    瞿白音的《创新独白》，名为“独白”，实际上是一个“合唱”。这不是瞿白音一个人的“新颖构思”而是电影界一个黑帮的集体创作。他们集体讨论于前，又认真修改于后。当瞿白音遭到革命人民的反击时，这个黑帮又为他出谋策划，顽抗到底。瞿白音是这个黑帮常驻上海的一员猛将，一名打手，他的反革命活动是在这个黑帮领导下的有组织、有计划的行动。
    一九六一年，正当我国革命人民遭到暂时困难之际，这个黑帮配合国际帝国主义和现代修正主义掀起的反华反共高潮，配合国内右倾机会主义分子发动的猖狂进攻，为一切牛鬼蛇神助威，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。一九六一年十月间，夏衍写了一篇文章，鼓吹“作品一定要有新意，新意，就是别人不曾写过的东西，新的主题、新的性格、新的结构、新的造型，乃至新的意境等等。艺术作品叫做创作，创，就是创造、创新的意思。‘拾人牙慧’，走别人走过的老路，讲别人讲过多少遍的陈言，是不能称为创作的。”夏衍的文章，为瞿白音的反共言论定了基调。在“祖师爷”的启发下，瞿白音大肆活跃，开始抛出他那一套反党反社会主义的政治主张和文艺主张。
    瞿白音的反党才干，获得了夏衍等人的赏识。一九六二年初，他们把瞿白音召到北京，打着所谓纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的幌子，密议抛出反共文章。这就是后来发表的《创新独白》。为了这篇文章，他们一帮人真是“呕心沥血”，动足脑筋。在陈荒煤、袁文殊的主持下，接连开了好几次会议，进行反复讨论，参加会的还有《中国电影发展史》的主编程季华以及《电影艺术》杂志的主编等若干人。这真是一场十分卖力的合唱，每个人都发出了自己的声音。陈荒煤唱得最起劲，他说：现在“陈言太多”，因此我们“要创新，要敢于对生活有自己独特的见解”。他还推荐了许多腐朽的资产阶级电影和修正主义电影作为“创新”的“样板”。
    这帮人的“新颖而独特”的见解，经过瞿白音的集中概括，终于形成了一篇《创新独白》。文章写好后，夏衍又亲笔加以修改，磨去了一些他认为过于“直露”的棱角，加上了一些革命词句的外衣。文章改好后，夏衍写信给瞿白音，说：“文章很好，颇有新意。”不久，就在《电影艺术》上发表了。
    文章一发表，瞿白音就兴致勃勃地以中国影协上海分会的名义，连续召开了几次“创新”座谈会，扩大其反动影响。会上，瞿白音自我宣扬地说：“这篇文章不能算我一个人写的，我们在北京已开了好几个座谈会。……我总觉得自己在过去，眼光实在太窄了。”当时，这个修正主义分子已经到了得意忘形的地步！
    文章发表不久，上海的有关领导同志就向瞿白音指出这篇文章的反动实质，可是，反共成性的瞿白音哪里肯听。特别还有一帮“后台老板”为他撑腰，叫他稳住阵脚。陈荒煤振振有词地说：“不能一反修正主义，创新就不要了。”他还当面对瞿白音拍了胸脯，替他壮胆，说：“创新还要创，我自己要写文章。”
    袁文殊呢？态度也非常鲜明。他两次写信给瞿白音，打气献策：《创新独白》“没有原则性的错误”，只是
  “说得不充分”，“因此也就有给人钻空子或误解的机会。”名为共产党员的袁文殊，在一个反党反社会主义分子面前，把批评瞿白音的上海党组织称之为钻空子的“人”。人们不禁要问：你们的立场究竟站到哪里去了？
    电影界的另一个“老头子”阳翰笙，也“一直很关心这件事情”。那时，他觉得非出来说话不可了，他责问上海的同志：“上海是否准备发表批判瞿的文章？”还威吓说：“上海方面是不是慎重些！”气焰十分嚣张。
    还有一个中国影协的机关刊物《电影艺术》杂志，不仅发表了《创新独白》，而且一再为这一反革命的政治纲领和文艺纲领辩护开脱，向党斗争到底，甚至写了专门的“编后记”，肯定瞿白音等人的基本观点是正确的。《电影艺术》这些“功绩”，人们是忘记不了的。最近它忽然在假装“剖析”夏衍《电影论文集》的同时，进行起“自我批评”来，说是“本刊编者本身存在着资产阶级思想，认识不到夏衍同志的错误，因此也跟在他后面鼓吹了这一条资产阶级文艺路线。”不，你们太“谦虚”了，你们向党向社会主义放了那么多毒箭，欠了革命人民那么一大笔债，轻描淡写谈几句什么“资产阶级思想”，能够解决问题吗？欠债是要还的，革命人民是不会让你们蒙混过关的！
    以上揭露的这些事实充分说明了：瞿白音的《创新独白》，不是一个偶然的、孤立的东西，它是文艺界一条反党反社会主义黑线的产物，它是电影界以夏衍、阳翰笙、陈荒煤、袁文殊为首的反革命黑帮的“集体创作”。
    这个黑帮，曾经想在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中躲过去，滑过去，他们想用假检讨的办法欺蒙革命的人民。但是，他们的如意算盘打错了。凡是反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，在这场革命的疾风暴雨中，一个也逃不脱。瞿白音被揪出来了，电影界的黑帮被揪出来了，文艺界的一条反党反社会主义黑线的根子也被揪出来了。这是一个伟大的胜利！革命的人民，一定高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决要把无产阶级的文化大革命进行到底！誓把这条黑线，誓把这批黑帮，从他们的“地方”，一直到他们的“中央”，统统都挖出来，从政治上、组织上、思想上、理论上、行动上给予彻底的摧毁，对他们毫不留情地实行专政，让他们永世不得翻身！只有这样，只有彻底地消灭资产阶级的“创新”即复辟活动，无产阶级才能够标新立异，即标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异！
    放眼世界看未来，坚定不移向前进！世界的未来是属于我们的！
