    Sichuan Sculptors Enthusiastically Praise New People of the Mao Zedong Era
    Sculpting a Statue for the Heroic Shepherd Boy Wang De'an
    Revolutionary art workers are vanguards in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and fighters for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. Revolutionary art workers must actively support and depict the numerous communist new people and new events in the countryside, and must strive to shape the heroic images of socialist workers, peasants, and soldiers to defeat all capitalist and feudal remnants, seize and expand the socialist ideological and cultural positions in the countryside.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 1st – Some of the creators of the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" and a group of Sichuan art workers, with strong class feelings and great enthusiasm, are sculpting statues and writing biographies for communist new people in the poor and lower-middle peasants who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Recently, while staying in the Da Shu Commune of Hanyuan County, they sculpted a statue for a nine-year-old heroic shepherd boy. The poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically praised it, saying: "In the old society, temples were filled with statues of Bodhisattvas, which the landlord class used to promote feudal superstition. Now we are sculpting our own heroes to promote Mao Zedong Thought. You have indeed done a great service for the poor and lower-middle peasants."
    This time, their statue is to commend the heroic deeds of Wang De'an, a local heroic shepherd boy who loves the collective. Wang De'an is the son of a poor peasant. From the letters of his brother in the People's Liberation Army and the class struggle history of the poor and lower-middle peasants often told by his father, he understood that Chairman Mao is the great savior of the working people, and that he must listen to Chairman Mao and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good child of Chairman Mao. When the commune members study Chairman Mao's works, he sits attentively by the table, supporting his cheeks with both hands, and listens quietly. Once, after listening to "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," he naively asked his father: "The old Foolish Old Man wanted to move the mountains away, should we also move the big mountain in our team?" His father told him: "What we want to learn is the spirit of the Foolish Old Man, to use the spirit of the old Foolish Old Man to build a new socialist countryside, change the appearance of the mountainous area, and let the cattle and sheep multiply and the mountains be full of flowers and fruits." From then on, Wang De'an's young heart was engraved with the lofty ambition of changing the appearance of the mountainous area. His family lived on a cliff on a steep hillside. If he was not careful when herding cattle, the cattle could fall and be killed or injured. However, Wang De'an took good care of a very stubborn cow. He carried a basket on his back and led the cattle up the mountain early in the morning, and returned late, feeding the cattle well. In the afternoon, he also picked a basket of cow dung and returned it to the production team. In the evening, he always threw night grass for the cattle before going to sleep. Sometimes it was cold at night, and he lovingly hugged the newborn calf and slept with it. Once, some children played mud battles and got some thin mud on the back of the cow. Wang De'an quickly used a small teacup to fetch water and washed the mud off the cow's body, cup by cup. Under Wang De'an's careful care, the cow grew very well and also gave birth to two calves. The masses praised: "De'an is really a good child educated by Chairman Mao!" The production team rated him as a model breeder three times.
    In February of this year, Wang De'an, in order not to injure the collective's saplings, led the cattle along the edge of the rock. Unfortunately, he was knocked off the rock by the cattle and gloriously sacrificed. The commune members were very sad, and the young people in the team held a memorial meeting for Wang De'an. The Hanyuan County Committee of the Communist Youth League posthumously recognized Wang De'an as a model member of the Chinese Young Pioneers.
    After the Sichuan sculptors learned about Wang De'an's model deeds, they were deeply moved. Someone suggested using the form of the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" to sculpt a statue for Wang De'an. However, due to other tasks at the time, some people thought that sculpting a statue for Wang De'an was an "extra" thing and suggested postponing it to a later date. Many people disagreed with this view. They believe that striving to shape the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of socialist literary and art workers. Although the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" they created in the past was a great revolution in sculpture, it still reflected the life before liberation. In order to make sculpture art better serve socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is necessary to enthusiastically praise contemporary heroic figures like Wang De'an who have grown up under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Revolutionary art workers are vanguards in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and fighters for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. We must actively support and depict the numerous communist new people and new events in the countryside, and must strive to shape the heroic images of socialist workers, peasants, and soldiers to defeat all capitalist and feudal remnants, seize and expand the socialist ideological and cultural positions in the countryside. This is a major event with far-reaching significance to highlight proletarian politics, and it is by no means a minor matter that can be done or not done.
    After more than ten days of efforts by seven sculptors, the statue of the heroic shepherd boy was born. Wang De'an's vivid expression and appearance are like a real person. People can appreciate from his innocent eyes looking into the distance that this is a teenager with lofty ideals. From the intimate expression of the calf clinging tightly to Wang De'an, it can be seen that Wang De'an has a noble character of loving the collective. The basket on the teenager's back, the cow muzzle cage around his waist, and his vigorous pace towards the mountain vividly depict a hardworking and simple good child. Another group of art workers stationed here, based on Wang De'an's ideals during his lifetime, painted a mural of cattle and sheep on the mountains after the statue, which further highlighted the theme of the statue.
    In order to sculpt the statue of the heroic teenager well, the art workers carefully studied Chairman Mao's work "Serve the People" and discussed Wang De'an's model deeds of loving Chairman Mao and loving the collective. They also visited the production team three times, herded cattle with the shepherds, and learned about Wang De'an's excellent qualities. In order to sculpt the statue well, the art workers crossed the Dadu River and carried suitable soil from more than ten miles away. During the sculpting process, they consulted many commune members and shepherds. Many poor and lower-middle peasants actively participated in digging the foundation and carrying stones. A seventy-year-old Red Army soldier who knew stonework also took the initiative to guide the authors in building the platform for the statue. Wang De'an's father and brother, the team cadres, and the shepherds who herded cattle with Wang De'an all came from the mountain to the statue site to personally guide the authors in sculpting the statue.
    After the statue was completed, it caused a sensation in the surrounding rural areas. Commune members from nearby communes rushed to see it when they went to the market or delivered grain to the street. Some elderly people who had not been to the street for many years also came to visit after hearing the news. A seventy-year-old blind woman carefully stroked the statue with her hands and praised the authors repeatedly: "You have sculpted a statue for such a good child of Chairman Mao, you have really done a great service for us!" Not long ago, more than 300 Young Pioneers held an oath-taking ceremony in front of Wang De'an's statue, expressing that they would love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, love the collective, and love labor like him, and be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Now, activities to learn Wang De'an's excellent qualities are widely carried out among the children in the whole commune, and many good people and good deeds have emerged. (Attached picture)

    四川雕塑工作者热情歌颂毛泽东时代新人
    为英雄牧童王德安塑象
    革命的美术工作者是宣传毛泽东思想的尖兵，是兴无灭资的战士。革命的美术工作者一定要积极地支持和表现农村中大量的共产主义的新人新事，一定要努力塑造社会主义的工农兵英雄形象，去战胜一切资本主义、封建主义残余势力，占领和扩大农村社会主义的思想文化阵地。
    新华社成都一日电　泥塑《收租院》的部分作者和四川的一批美术工作者，怀着强烈的阶级感情，满腔热忱地为贫农下中农中用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人塑象、立传。最近，他们在汉源县大树公社蹲点时为一个九岁的英雄牧童塑象，贫农下中农热烈地赞扬说：旧社会庙里塑的是菩萨，地主阶级用它来宣传封建迷信思想；现在我们塑起自己的英雄，用它来宣传毛泽东思想，你们硬是为贫农下中农做了一件大好事。
    他们这次塑象是为了表彰当地一个英雄牧童王德安热爱集体的事迹。王德安是贫农的儿子。他从在解放军里的哥哥来信和父亲经常讲说的贫农下中农阶级斗争史中，懂得了毛主席是劳动人民的大救星，必须听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好孩子。社员们学习毛主席著作时，他很懂事地坐在桌旁，两手支撑着面颊静静地听着。有一次他听了《愚公移山》，天真地问爸爸：“老愚公要把山搬走，我们是不是也要把我们队里的大山搬走？”爸爸告诉他：“我们要学的是愚公移山的精神，要用老愚公那样的精神来建设社会主义新农村，改变山区的面貌，让牛羊成群，花果满山”。从此，王德安幼小的心灵里刻上了改变山区面貌的雄心大志。他家住在一个悬岩陡壁的山坡上，放牛时稍一不慎，牛就可能跌死跌伤。但王德安却把一头脾气很犟的牛养得很好。他清晨背着背兜，牵着牛儿上山，放的早，收的迟，把牛喂得饱饱的；下午还拣一背兜牛粪回来交给生产队。晚上，他总是给牛丢上夜草才去睡觉。有时夜里冷，他心疼地将刚出生的小牛儿抱在怀里和它一起睡。一次，有的小孩打泥巴仗玩，把一些稀泥弄到牛背上，王德安连忙用小茶缸盛水，一缸一缸地为牛洗去身上的泥巴。在王德安精心喂养下，这条牛长得很好，还生了两头小牛。群众赞扬说：德安娃真是毛主席教育的好孩子！生产队三次评他为模范饲养员。
    今年二月，王德安为了不碰伤集体的树苗，牵着牛从岩边走，不幸被牛撞下岩，光荣地牺牲了。社员们十分悲痛，队里的青年们为王德安开了追悼会，共青团汉源县委追认王德安为中国少年先锋队模范队员。
    四川雕塑工作者知道了王德安的模范事迹后，深受感动。有人提议采用泥塑《收租院》的形式为王德安塑象。但是由于当时另有任务，有人就认为为王德安塑象是“份外”的事，提议推迟到以后再说。许多人不同意这个看法。他们认为，努力塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄形象，是社会主义文艺工作者的根本任务。他们过去创作的泥塑《收租院》虽然是雕塑的大革命，但是它反映的还是解放前的生活。为了让雕塑艺术更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，就一定要热情歌颂象王德安这样的在毛主席思想哺育下成长起来的当代英雄人物。他们说：革命的美术工作者是宣传毛泽东思想的尖兵，是兴无灭资的战士。我们一定要积极地支持和表现农村中大量的共产主义的新人新事，一定要努力塑造社会主义的工农兵英雄形象，去战胜一切资本主义、封建主义残余势力，占领和扩大农村社会主义的思想文化阵地。这是一件具有深远意义的突出无产阶级政治的大事，绝不是可办可不办的小事。
    经过七个雕塑工作者十多天的努力，英雄牧童的塑象诞生了。王德安栩栩如生的神彪和象貌如真人一般。人们从他那天真地望着远方的眼神，可以体察出这是一个胸怀远大理想的少年；从紧紧依着王德安的小黄牛的亲昵神情中，可以看出王德安热爱集体的高尚品质；少年背上的背兜、腰间的牛嘴笼和他那向山上前进的矫健步伐，都形象地刻划出一个勤劳朴实的好孩子。在这里蹲点的另一批美术工作者，还根据王德安生前的理想，在塑象后绘了一幅牛羊满山的壁画，更突出了塑象的主题思想。
    美术工作者们为了塑造好英雄少年的象，认真学习了毛主席著作《为人民服务》，讨论了王德安热爱毛主席，热爱集体的模范事迹。他们还三次到生产队进行访问，同牧童们一起放牛，了解王德安的优秀品质。为了把象塑好，美术工作者们渡过大渡河，从十多里外背来适宜的泥土。他们在塑象过程中请教了许多社员和牧童，许多贫农下中农都积极主动地参加挖地基，抬石块的工作。一个会石工活的七十多岁的老红军也主动来指点作者们打石头，砌塑象的台子。王德安的父亲和哥哥，队干部和与王德安一道放牛的牧童，都从山上来到塑象的现场，亲自指点作者们塑象。
    塑象完成后，轰动了周围的农村。附近公社的社员们赶场、送粮上街，都争着来看。一些多年没有上街的老人闻讯后也赶来参观。一位七十多岁的双目失明的老大娘用手仔细地在塑象上抚摸，连声称赞作者：“你们给这样一个毛主席的好孩子塑象，硬是为我们做了一件大好事呵！”不久前，有三百多名少年先锋队员在王德安的塑象前举行入队宣誓仪式，表示要象他那样热爱共产党，热爱毛主席，热爱集体，热爱劳动，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。现在，全社少年儿童中正广泛开展学习王德安优秀品质的活动，出现了许多好人好事。（附图片）
