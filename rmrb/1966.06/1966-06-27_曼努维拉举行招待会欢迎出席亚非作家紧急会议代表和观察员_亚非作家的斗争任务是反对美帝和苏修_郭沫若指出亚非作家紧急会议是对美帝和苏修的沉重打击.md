Manuwila held a reception to welcome representatives and observers from 47 countries and regions in Asia and Africa attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, as well as observers from some international organizations. The reception was held this evening in Manuwila. Writers from Asia and Africa gathered to celebrate the anti-imperialist unity of Asian and African writers and to wish the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers a resounding success.

Today marks the eve of the highly anticipated Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. The Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, representing Manuwila, extended a warm welcome to the representatives and observers attending this emergency conference at the grand reception. He said, "Our gathering today is on the eve of a historic event—the opening of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. Starting tomorrow, our task at the conference is not only to oppose imperialism led by the United States but also to oppose Soviet modern revisionism. These are the two main enemies of the Asian and African peoples. Our struggle must never cease in opposing American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism."

He severely condemned the split conference in Cairo, which was orchestrated by Soviet modern revisionists, and all the illegal resolutions passed there. He said, "The purpose of the Cairo split conference is to oppose the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, to oppose the Asian and African Writers' Movement, and to oppose the conference we are about to hold tomorrow. The Cairo split conference is a betrayal of the world's people and a betrayal of the Asian and African peoples."

Manuwila pointed out that the arrival of representatives from various countries in Beijing to attend the conference is a resolute response to the Soviet modern revisionists who attempt to sabotage our conference and disrupt the unity of the Asian and African peoples.

He said, "The sabotage and disruptive activities of the Soviet modern revisionists and their small group of followers have completely failed. We want to tell the Soviet modern revisionists that you can continue your sabotage activities, but we Asian and African revolutionary writers will continue to advance. Your sabotage activities will never succeed. Because the struggle of Asian and African writers is closely linked with the struggle of the Asian and African peoples. This is something that no force can destroy or obstruct."

Chinese delegation leader Guo Moruo said in his speech, "The Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers, which will begin tomorrow, is an unprecedented grand event. Now, representatives from 47 countries and regions have arrived in Beijing. On behalf of Chinese writers and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome to our friends from various countries and express my highest respect."

Guo Moruo said, "The enthusiastic participation of our friends from various countries in this conference shows the unwavering support of Asian and African writers and peoples for the struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country. It also shows that the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and their struggle to achieve and maintain national independence, is surging higher and higher. This is a heavy blow to the aggressive and war policies of the common enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and it is also a heavy blow to the plot of the Soviet splitters, who are friends of American imperialism, to sabotage the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers."

Guo Moruo concluded by shouting: "Progressive writers and peoples of Asia and Africa should unite more closely to overthrow imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States!"

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee Zhang Xianwo, and President of the China Foreign Affairs Friendship Association Chu Tuonan were invited to attend the reception.

Some foreign friends in Beijing were also invited to attend the reception.

The reception was held at the Jingxi Hotel. In the evening, under the bright lights of the grand hall, representatives from various Asian and African countries, with different skin colors and speaking different languages, greeted each other warmly and exchanged brotherly greetings and congratulations. The reception was filled with a warm atmosphere of friendship and fighting unity. (Photo attached)

    曼努维拉举行招待会欢迎出席亚非作家紧急会议代表和观察员
    亚非作家的斗争任务是反对美帝和苏修
    郭沫若指出亚非作家紧急会议是对美帝和苏修的沉重打击
    新华社二十六日讯　出席亚非作家紧急会议的亚洲、非洲四十七个国家和地区的作家代表以及一些国际组织的观察员，今晚在曼努维拉举行的招待会上欢聚一堂，热烈欢庆亚非作家的反帝大团结，预祝亚非作家紧急会议获得圆满成功。
    今天是全世界瞩目的亚非作家紧急会议开幕的前夕，亚非作家常设局秘书长代表曼努维拉在盛大招待会上，向出席这次紧急会议的各国代表和观察员表示热烈的欢迎。他说，我们今天的聚会，是在一个具有重大历史意义事件——亚非作家紧急会议开幕的前夕。明天开始举行的会议上，我们的斗争任务，不仅要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，而且要反对苏联现代修正主义。这是我们亚非人民的两个主要敌人。我们的斗争一刻也不能离开反对美帝国主义和反对苏联现代修正主义。
    他严厉谴责由苏联现代修正主义者所策划的开罗分裂会议，及其所通过的一切非法决议。他说，开罗分裂会议的目的是反对亚非作家常设局，反对亚非作家运动，反对我们明天即将举行的会议。开罗分裂会议是对世界人民的背叛，是对亚非人民的背叛。
    曼努维拉指出，各国代表到北京来开会，对企图破坏我们会议和破坏亚非人民团结的苏联现代修正主义者是一个坚决的回击。
    他说，苏联现代修正主义者及其一小撮追随者的分裂和破坏活动彻底失败了。我们要告诉苏联现代修正主义者，你们可以继续进行破坏活动，但是我们亚非革命作家将继续前进，你们的破坏活动永远也不会得逞。因为亚非作家的斗争是和亚非人民的斗争紧密联系在一起的。这是任何力量也破坏不了、阻挡不了的。
    中国代表团团长郭沫若在讲话中说，将在明天开始的亚非作家紧急会议是空前的盛会。现在已经有四十七个国家和地区的代表到达北京。他代表中国作家和中国人民对各国朋友表示热烈欢迎，并致崇高的敬意。
    郭沫若说，各国朋友这样踊跃地参加这次会议，表明了亚非作家和人民对越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的斗争的无条件支持，也表明了亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，以及争取和维护民族独立斗争的浪潮越来越高涨。这是对世界人民共同敌人美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的一个沉重打击，也是对美帝国主义的朋友苏联分裂主义者破坏亚非作家紧急会议的阴谋的沉重打击。
    郭沫若最后高呼：亚非进步作家和亚非人民进一步团结起来，打倒以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    人大常委会副委员长刘宁一，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，对外文委主任张奚若，对外友协会长楚图南等，应邀出席了招待会。
    在北京的一些外国朋友也应邀出席了招待会。
    招待会在京西宾馆举行。入晚，在灯火辉煌的大厅里，有着不同肤色、操着不同语言的亚非各国代表，亲切见面，互致兄弟的问候和祝贺。招待会上洋溢着一片友谊和战斗团结的气氛。（附图片）
