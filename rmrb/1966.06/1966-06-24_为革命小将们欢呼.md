    Cheers for the Revolutionary Young Generals
    In the past few days, the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the university enrollment method, a decision of great historical significance, has resonated in the hearts of thousands upon thousands of revolutionary youths. They enthusiastically cheered and sang aloud. They solemnly assured Chairman Mao: We vow to be successors to the proletarian revolution, and actively participate in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement. They must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the proletarian education front, and pass it on from generation to generation.
    The collection of short articles, short poems, and letters published in this newspaper today are just a few waves in a surging torrent. However, readers can hear from here the voices of the younger generation who have grown up nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They dare to think, dare to act, dare to make revolution, dare to challenge the old, dare to criticize bourgeois educational thought, and smash the old educational system and all old things that hinder the progress of history. They have the world in mind and take world revolution as their own responsibility. What a lovely generation of young people, what a trustworthy generation of young people, and what a generation of young people worthy of learning from and of which we can be proud!
    Chairman Mao taught young comrades: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, and are in a period of flourishing, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you." Chairman Mao also said with infinite warmth: "The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." Our revolutionary young generals read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and advance along the road pointed out by Chairman Mao. They stride onto the historical stage of world revolution.
    Let us warmly cheer for the rapidly growing proletarian revolutionary successors! Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high, forever fly high, in the hearts of the revolutionary people of China and the world!

    为革命小将们欢呼
    这几天来，党中央和国务院发布的关于改革高等学校招考办法这个具有伟大历史意义的决定，在千千万万革命青年的心头震响。他们热情欢呼，放声歌唱。他们庄严地向毛主席保证：誓做无产阶级革命接班人，积极参加当前无产阶级文化大革命运动。他们一定要在无产阶级教育阵地上，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高地举起来，世世代代地传下去。
    今天本报发表的这组短文、短诗和信件，只是汹涌澎湃的激流中的几朵浪花。但是，读者可以从这儿听到在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的青年一代的心声。他们敢想敢干，敢于闹革命，敢于向旧事物挑战，敢于批判资产阶级的教育思想，把旧的教育制度和一切阻碍历史前进的旧事物打得落花流水。他们胸怀天下，以世界革命为己任。这是多么可爱的青年一代，多么可信任的青年一代，又是多么值得学习、值得我们引以自豪的青年一代！
    毛主席教导青年同志：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”毛主席又无限亲切地说：“世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”我们的革命小将们，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，沿着毛主席指引的道路前进。他们迈开大步踏上世界革命的历史舞台。
    让我们为迅速成长起来的无产阶级革命接班人热烈欢呼！让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在中国和世界革命人民的心头，高高地飘扬，永远地飘扬！
