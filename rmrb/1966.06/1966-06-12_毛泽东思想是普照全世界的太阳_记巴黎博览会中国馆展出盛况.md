    Mao Zedong Thought is the Sun Illuminating the Whole World
    ——A Record of the Grandeur of the Chinese Pavilion at the Paris Exposition
    In recent days, the people of Paris have been enthusiastically discussing the Chinese Pavilion at the Paris Exposition. They say, "The world has precious pearls, and China has them." Eight hundred thousand people visited the Chinese Pavilion. They came from all parts of France, and audiences from fifty-eight other countries also visited this "miraculous exhibition."
    On the last day of the Exposition, even more people flocked to visit. To satisfy the audience's demands, the pavilion opened an hour earlier and closed at 9:00 PM (instead of the usual 7:00 PM). While other pavilions at the Exposition began dismantling their exhibits, the Chinese Pavilion remained as crowded as a bustling marketplace. A French farmer traveled specifically from the western coastal region to visit the Chinese Pavilion. He said enthusiastically, "This exhibition is a great success. The 300-kilometer round trip was not in vain, and many people regret not seeing it." Audiences greatly admired the high achievements of Chinese arts and crafts. They said that with every step they took in the exhibition hall, they discovered a new miracle, and their joy was indescribable. They said, "Coming to your pavilion, my two eyes were not enough," "I felt like I had entered a mythical fairyland." Many audience members also said, "Among your beautiful exhibits, in the pleasant music, and with the smiling reception, we spent an unforgettable day."
    Inside and outside the Chinese Pavilion, people were discussing it with great interest. They said that Chinese crafts not only inherited thousands of years of tradition, but also have experienced enormous development and improvement in the past decade or so. This is the result of the wise leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Audience members enthusiastically wrote in the guestbook, "The socialist system allows everyone to contribute their abilities," "Your exhibition reflects the strong vitality of the Chinese people," "As long as there is China in the world, there is art."
    The French people have a heartfelt love for China and Chairman Mao. In the prologue hall, as soon as audience members stepped through the door, they were immediately attracted by the giant velvet embroidery "Six Hundred Million People Are All Saints." They kept murmuring "Mao Zedong," stopping for a long time, reluctant to leave. In the central hall, when audience members discovered another giant embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao, they once again expressed their heartfelt joy. Many French friends took group photos in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. A friend from Bordeaux made the embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao into a slide and prepared to take it back to show. He specially bought a record of the Chinese national anthem from a bookstore. He told us that he planned to play the Chinese national anthem when showing the slide of Chairman Mao's embroidered portrait. In the audience members' enthusiastic messages, one could often see: "I like every one of your works, but what I like the most is the velvet embroidered portrait 'Chairman Mao Among the People.'" Some audience members also wrote: "Being able to see Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness." "Long live Chairman Mao." "Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese revolution, but also the leader of the world revolution, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." "Please convey our friendly greetings to Mao Zedong." Many audience members from other countries visiting the Exposition also expressed their deep concern and greetings to Chairman Mao. Many people asked us, the exhibition staff, with concern: "Is Chairman Mao healthy?" We replied, "Chairman Mao is very healthy." They excitedly shook the hands of our comrades and said, "This is the happiness of the people of the world." When audience members saw the staff of the exhibition group wearing Chairman Mao badges, they asked to have them as souvenirs. Their sincere feelings moved everyone present. When the staff gave them the badges, they joyfully grasped our comrades' hands tightly, too moved to speak. Some people who received a Chairman Mao badge brought a bouquet of roses the next day.
    In front of the ivory carving "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains," crowds of audience members gathered from morning till night. They carefully watched the glorious course of the Red Army's Long March and silently listened to the story of the Long March. Many audience members listened to it again and again, and then brought their families to listen. Some audience members were moved to tears after listening. A retired railway worker said, "You speak well, you should speak more. Some people still don't know that there is imperialism in the world and don't know what revolution is." "The path China is taking is correct." An elderly woman brought a bouquet of flowers to the "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" narrator the day after visiting the Chinese Pavilion. She said, "China is our hope. I congratulate the Chinese people on the great victories they have achieved, especially the major victories in the struggle against the Soviet revisionist leaders." An eight-year-old girl wrote in the guestbook after seeing "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains": "I love Mao Zedong." A French worker visited the exhibition and left enthusiastic messages. He felt that he still could not express his love for Chairman Mao, so he specially found our staff and shook hands tightly, saying, "Now I truly feel that China is the true Marxist-Leninist, and Mao Zedong is the great standard-bearer of the revolution. You have many friends in France that you don't even know about." The next day, this worker brought his two children to visit the exhibition again. As soon as he entered the door, he went straight to "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains." He said to the narrator, "I already heard about the great deeds of the 25,000-li Long March yesterday. Now I want to tell my sons about it." When our narrator went to rest, some audience members who had heard the explanation took the initiative to explain it to other audience members.
    Many people bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" after visiting the exhibition, and some people brought Chairman Mao's works to the exhibition. A young man carefully took out the French version of Volume III of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from his briefcase to show us. He said he had already finished reading it. He had read this book repeatedly. Many pen marks could be seen on each page, but the cover of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was still brand new. He wrapped the cover with two layers of book cover, fearing that it would be worn out in his briefcase. He said, "Light comes from the East."
    Visiting the Chinese Pavilion left a deep impression on the audience: a country full of artistic miracles must also be full of miracles in industry, agriculture, science and technology. A country that can produce such exquisite products must be prosperous and strong, and its people must be happy. The source of happiness and prosperity comes from the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Many audience members visiting the Chinese Pavilion emphatically expressed their strong wishes in the guestbook: "I visited such a wonderful exhibition. China is amazing! China is a banner. I must go to China!" An eighty-year-old woman wrote in her poem to us: "China, you encourage us to move forward,
    Because you are the source of sunshine."
    Yes, Mao Zedong Thought is truth, it is the sun. It has not only brought light and happiness to the Chinese people, but is also illuminating the whole world, leading all of humanity to a new era. (Attached picture)

    毛泽东思想是普照全世界的太阳
    ——记巴黎博览会中国馆展出盛况
    这些天来，巴黎的人们在热烈地谈论着巴黎博览会内的中国馆，他们说：“世界上有宝贵的珍珠，有中国”。八十万人参观了中国馆，他们来自法国各地，还有五十八个国家的观众也来参观了这个“奇迹般的展览。”
    博览会的最后一天，参观的人更为踊跃，为了满足观众的要求，提前一个小时开馆，闭馆的时间延迟到下午九点（平时七点）。当博览会其他馆都开始拆卸展品的时候，中国馆仍然象闹市一样拥挤着参观的人。一位法国农民从西部沿海地区专程赶来参观了中国馆，他兴致勃勃地说：“这个展览是非常成功的，往返三百公里也没有白跑，而且还有许多人惋惜没有看上。”观众们对中国工艺美术的高度成就赞赏不已，他们说在展览馆内每移动一步都会发现新的奇迹，欢喜的心情是无法表达的。他们说：“来到你们馆，我的两只眼睛不够用了”，“我仿佛进入了一座神话般的仙境之中。”许多观众还说：“在你们美妙的展品行列中，在悦耳的音乐声中，在微笑的接待中，我们度过了难忘的一天。”
    在中国馆内、馆外，人们都在津津有味地谈论着。他们说，中国工艺不仅继承了几千年的传统，而且在近十几年来又有了巨大的发展和提高，这是中国共产党和毛主席英明领导和关怀的结果。观众们在留言簿上热情地写道：“社会主义制度，使你们大家各尽其能”，“你们的展览反映了中国人民强大的生命力”，“世界上只要有中国，就有艺术”。
    法国人民对中国和毛主席是衷心热爱的。在序幕大厅里，观众们一踏进大门，立即就被巨幅绒绣“六亿神州尽舜尧”所吸引，口里不停地小声念着“毛泽东”，久久停步，不愿离去。在中央大厅里，当观众们发现另一幅毛主席的巨大绣象时，又一次发出内心的喜悦。许多法国朋友在毛主席象前合影留念。一位波尔多城的朋友，把毛主席绣象制成了幻灯片，准备带回去放映，他特地从书店买了一张中国国歌的唱片。他对我们说，准备在放映毛主席绣象镜头时，放中国国歌。在观众们热情的留言中经常可以看到：“我喜欢你们的每一件作品，但是最喜欢的还是‘毛主席在人民群众之中’那幅绒绣象。”还有的观众写道：“能看到毛主席是最大的幸福”。“祝毛主席万寿无疆”。“毛主席万岁”。“毛主席不仅是中国革命的领袖，也是世界革命的领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”“请转达对毛泽东的友好问候。”参观博览会的其他国家的许多观众也向我们表达他们对毛主席的亲切关怀和问候。许多人关切地问我们展览会工作人员：“毛主席健康吗？”我们回答说：“毛主席很健康。”他们激动地握着我们同志的手说：“这是我们世界人民的幸福。”观众们看到展览团工作人员胸前戴着毛主席象纪念章，就要求送给他们留作纪念，他们那种真挚的感情，感动了在场的每一个人。当工作人员把纪念章送给他们的时候，他们就喜悦地紧紧握住我们同志的手，激动地讲不出话来，有些人得了一枚毛主席象纪念章，第二天就送来一束玫瑰花。
    象牙雕刻“万水千山”的面前，从早到晚都挤满了观众，他们仔细地看红军长征的光辉历程，默默地听讲长征的故事。有不少观众听了一遍又一遍，然后带着全家人来听，有些观众听完后，感动得流下了眼泪。有位退休的铁路工人说：“你们讲得好，应该多讲，现在有人还不知道世界上有帝国主义，不知道什么叫革命。”“中国走的道路是正确的。”一位老年妇女在参观中国馆第二天，带来一束鲜花送给“万水千山”的讲解员，她说：“中国是我们的希望，我祝贺中国人民所取得的巨大胜利，特别是在反对苏共修正主义领导人的斗争中所取得的重大胜利。”一个八岁的小女孩，看了“万水千山”以后，在留言簿上写道：“我热爱毛泽东。”一位法国工人参观了展览，留下了热情洋溢的留言，他感到还表达不了对毛泽东主席的热爱，又特地找到我工作人员，紧紧地握着手说：“现在我真正觉得中国是真正的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东是革命的伟大旗手，你们在法国有很多你们所不知道的朋友。”这位工人第二天带着他的两个孩子又来参观展览，一踏进大门，就直往“万水千山”走去，他对讲解员说：“我昨天已经听过二万五千里长征的伟大事迹，现在我要讲给我的儿子听。”当我们的讲解员去休息的时候，有的听过讲解的观众就主动地给其他观众做讲解。
    许多人参观了展览以后，便到书店买《毛泽东选集》，还有的人带着毛主席著作到展览会来。一位青年从皮包里小心翼翼地拿出《毛泽东选集》第三卷的法文本给我们看，他说他已经读完了。这本书他反复阅读过，从每张书页上看到不少用笔勾划的记号，可是《毛泽东选集》的封面还是崭新的，他在封面外包着两层书皮，唯恐在他的皮包里磨坏了。他说：“光明来自东方。”
    通过参观中国馆，给观众们留下了深刻的印象：一个充满了艺术奇迹的国家，必然在工业方面、农业方面、科学技术方面也都充满了奇迹，一个能够生产出如此精美产品的国家，必然是繁荣、富强，人民是幸福的。幸福、繁荣的源泉来自中国共产党和毛泽东主席。参观中国馆的许多观众着重地在留言簿上表达着自己强烈的愿望：“我参观了这样美好的展览，中国真了不起！中国是个旗帜，我一定要到中国去！”一位八十多岁的妇女给我们的诗中写道：“中国啊，你鼓舞我们向前，
    因为，你是阳光的源泉。”
    是的，毛泽东思想就是真理，就是太阳。她不但给中国人民带来了光明和幸福，而且正在普照全世界，把整个人类引向一个新的纪元。（附图片）
