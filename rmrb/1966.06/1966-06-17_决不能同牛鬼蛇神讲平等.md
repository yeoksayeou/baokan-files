    When the Deng Tuo gang was attacking the Party, they constantly promoted the fallacy of so-called "equality." For example, towards "all things," "opening up is better than blocking," "any drama is equal," "should be treated equally," and so on. In December 1965, as a spokesperson for an anti-Party group, Deng Tuo, using the pseudonym Xiang Yangsheng, openly proposed "everyone is equal before the truth" in his pseudo-critical article of Wu Han. This reactionary and hypocritical bourgeois slogan was an important weapon for Deng Tuo and his supporters in their struggle against the Party. They claimed that if they didn't pursue this "equality" they advocated, if their counter-revolutionary gang was exposed and criticized, it would be "winning by force" and "using power to suppress people."
    
    Can we talk about equality with demons and monsters like Deng Tuo and his ilk? Absolutely not! We must thoroughly settle accounts for all their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes. We must thoroughly criticize every poisonous weed they release. There is no question of "equality" in the struggle between the truth of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and all bourgeois fallacies. Chairman Mao taught us: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history, such is the history of civilization for thousands of years." (《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》"Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle") Throughout history, in class society, it's either one ruling class oppressing the ruled class, or that ruling class oppressing this ruling class. There has never been any "equality," nor has there ever been "equality." In old China, which ruling class treated us workers and peasants "equally"? Today, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been established, the people are in power, and representatives of the reactionary classes are clamoring for "equality." Of course, we cannot give them any "equality," but rather "oppress these people, only allow them to behave themselves and not allow them to talk or act wildly. If they want to talk or act wildly, immediately ban them and impose sanctions." (《论人民民主专政》"On the People's Democratic Dictatorship")
    
    Should we "actively guide and vigorously support" "all things" so that they can "develop smoothly"? Your demand for "equality" is absolutely impossible. We should actively guide and strongly support only revolutionary and newborn things, not reactionary and decadent things. "You are blocking the road of things' movement and development." That's right! We certainly want to "block" the road of development for you reactionary things. Without blocking, there is no flow. If we don't "block" reactionary things, we can't talk about supporting revolutionary things. If we don't "block" bourgeois ideology, we can't talk about developing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought. If we don't "block" the road to capitalist restoration, we can't talk about adhering to the socialist road. When all reactionary classes "guide" counter-revolutionary things, don't they desperately "block" all revolutionary things? The Khrushchev revisionists actively "guided" those things of bourgeois liberalization that you were very interested in, and tried their best to "block" Marxism-Leninism, and greatly opposed Stalin; as a result, the first socialist country in the world changed its color. Aren't your own actions also proving this point?
    
    What does it mean that you want us to greatly "guide" your anti-Party and anti-socialist things without "blocking" them at all, and that you want us to treat "all things" "equally"? To put it bluntly, you don't just want to earn a green light for unobstructed passage, the right to sit on an equal footing; but you want to use your soft knives and hard clubs to overthrow the leadership of the Party, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and completely change the direction of our socialism and communism. What you hope for is by no means "equality for all," but rather a reversed inequality, that is, to ride on our heads again and turn the masses of the people into slaves of demons and monsters.
    
    Chairman Mao taught us: "In the era when classes and class struggle still exist both internationally and domestically, the working class and the masses of the people who have seized state power must suppress all counter-revolutionary classes, groups, and individuals' resistance to the revolution, stop their restoration activities, and prohibit all counter-revolutionary elements from using freedom of speech to achieve their counter-revolutionary goals." Deng Tuo and his gang, we will never "actively guide" or "treat equally" your anti-Party and anti-socialist things! We are determined to "block" you!
    
    The "letting go" that obliterates class content and the "being kind to people" regardless of enemies or friends, as emphasized by those "authoritative figures," are inherited from Deng Tuo's "active guidance" and "treating all things equally," and there is no difference except for a change of name. You echo each other, nothing more than to deliberately muddy the waters, confuse class lines, shift the target of struggle, protect a large number of poisonous weeds from criticism, and let them out of the cage. Doesn't this precisely show that you are resisting the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao and resisting the socialist cultural revolution?
    
    Isn't the Deng Tuo gang scolding us for "relying on power" and "winning by force"? Aren't those so-called "authoritative figures" also scolding us for "not suppressing people with power like academic overlords"? This malicious attack or empty intimidation cannot stop the revolutionary people from exposing and criticizing you. What "using power to suppress people," etc., is the same meaning as the "hegemonism" and "totalitarian government" said by imperialism and modern revisionism, it is a kind of "tape recording broadcast" or "reprint." These are the real "clichés," and we are used to hearing them. Whether "using power to suppress people" is correct depends on what kind of "power" is relied on and what kind of "people" are suppressed. Chairman Mao taught us: "Exploiters and counter-revolutionaries are always a minority anytime and anywhere, while the exploited and revolutionaries are always a majority, therefore, the dictatorship of the latter is fully justified, while the former are always in the wrong." If we rely on the power of the people and exercise the power of the people to suppress the enemies of the people, it is completely correct and very necessary, and we have always done so. If we rely on the "authoritative" power of the bourgeoisie to suppress the masses of the people and deprive them of their right to speak, it is a reactionary act that must be "immediately banned and sanctioned," which is originally an important mission of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    
    Who is it that shouts "equality," "equality" in their mouths, but actually "relies on power," steals names, and uses "Party spirit" and "organizational discipline" to attack those revolutionaries who firmly implement the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao? Who is it that has thrown out hundreds of poisonous weeds and boasted that they are "not a word empty," "every word is a cannonball," "speaking very cleanly, without leaving traces," but does not allow the revolutionary people to say a word of disapproval? Who is it that "relies on power" to detain manuscripts exposing and criticizing anti-Party elements such as Deng Tuo for a long time, making things difficult in every possible way, gouging out their eyes, piercing their hearts, and changing their faces? Who is it that was still issuing orders and running around lobbying when the reactionary political face of Wu Han, a member of the "Three-Family Village," had been exposed, only allowing people to talk about academics and not allowing people to talk about politics; or only allowing people to criticize Wu Han and not allowing people to expose Deng Tuo? Who is it that shows kindness to all demons and monsters, but treats all revolutionary people as enemies? Are all these Deng Tuo and his supporters' "equality" for the revolutionary people?
    
    Chairman Mao has always taught us that we should support whatever the enemy opposes, and oppose whatever the enemy supports. The bourgeoisie's "equality" is incompatible with the dictatorship of the proletariat. All remarks that promote this kind of "equality," whether in the past or present, whether from the mouth of Deng Tuo or from the mouth of someone else, are all fallacies that must be thoroughly exposed and smashed to pieces. As for our proletarian dictatorship, no matter whether the enemy curses it as "dictatorship" or "totalitarian government," the revolutionary people will always resolutely defend it like protecting their eyes. "For the victorious people, this is as indispensable as cloth and millet. This is a very good thing, a protective talisman, an heirloom, until the day when foreign imperialism and domestic classes are completely and cleanly eliminated, this magic weapon must not be abandoned." (《为什么要讨论白皮书》"Why It Is Necessary to Discuss the White Paper") We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's words and resolutely defend this protective heirloom!
    
    "We are talking about equality for all 'before the truth'." Can you cover up the reactionary essence of this hypocritical slogan with the "beautiful" and "pleasant" phrase "before the truth"? We want to ask: what kind of "truth" are you talking about? Is it a supra-class "truth"? In a society where classes still exist, this supra-class "truth" has never existed, only the truth of classes. Is it the truth of the proletariat? When have you ever recognized the truth of the proletariat, the truth of Marxism? When have you ever treated it "equally"? Isn't Mao Zedong Thought, the universal truth of contemporary, highest, and most alive Marxism-Leninism, which is firmly supported by the revolutionary people, always being slandered by you as "bragging," "empty talk," "clichés," "subjectivism," and "dogmatism," which should be "completely rested"? Aren't all the poisonous arrows you release, and the various hatreds deep in your souls, concentrated on opposing and resisting Mao Zedong Thought?
    
    When your anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds are criticized, you play with the name of "truth" and put up the broken flag of "equality for all before the truth," but you are only using this as a cover to peddle your private goods of bourgeois fallacies. You want people to regard your set of fallacies as "truth," your anti-Party words and deeds as "the expression of truth," and yourselves as "the embodiment of truth." This means that the revolutionary people are not allowed to criticize your large number of poisonous weeds, and the revolutionary people are not allowed to expose your anti-Party conspiracies, that is, only you are allowed to launch frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism, and we are not allowed to carry out any counterattacks. And your most important and fundamental purpose is to try to use this reactionary and hypocritical slogan to oppose and resist the truth of Mao Zedong Thought, and negate the authority of Mao Zedong Thought, so as to vigorously engage in your bourgeois liberalization and realize your dream of restoring capitalism.
    
    Different classes hold different attitudes towards Mao Zedong Thought, this great truth. In the eyes of the proletariat and all revolutionary people, Mao Zedong Thought is the sun that never sets, a weapon that is invincible in guiding the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. They love it, study it, and apply it. In the eyes of all reactionaries, it is a thorn in their side and a thorn in their flesh. They hate it, slander it, and attack it. They fear Mao Zedong Thought as demons and ghosts fear the sun. Imperialism is like this, modern revisionism is like this, and the Deng Tuo gang and its supporters are also like this. Because the truth of Mao Zedong Thought is diametrically opposed to their set of bourgeois and revisionist fallacies. Because in the face of the truth of Mao Zedong Thought, all their sinister conspiracies are difficult to succeed. Because the revolutionary people have mastered the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, all demons and monsters have nowhere to hide.
    
    The enemy is our best teacher, it shows us from the opposite side the importance and urgency of studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought. At present, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field and the cultural field is a life-and-death struggle. The enemy will not be willing to fail and will inevitably make a final struggle. In such a fierce and complex struggle, only by truly arming ourselves thoroughly with Mao Zedong Thought can we see through the enemy's various conspiracies, expose the enemy's various deceptions, and consolidate and seize one position after another. Studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is not only the foundation for winning this struggle, but also the foundation for winning the complete victory of the socialist revolution and construction, and also the foundation for winning the world revolution. Let us raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and better study the truth of Mao Zedong Thought! All demons and monsters will be swept away by the revolutionary people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought!

    决不能同牛鬼蛇神讲平等
　　宗于东
    邓拓黑帮在向党进攻的时候，曾不断地鼓吹过所谓“平等”的谬论。例如：对“一切事物”，“堵塞不如开导”，“任何剧目都是平等的”，“应该一视同仁”，等等。一九六五年十二月，作为一个反党集团的发言人，邓拓又在化名向阳生写的那篇对吴晗进行假批判的文章中，公开提出了什么“在真理面前人人平等”。这个反动的、虚伪的资产阶级口号，是邓拓之流及其支持者对党斗争的一个重要武器。他们声称，如果不搞他们所主张的这种“平等”，如果对他们这个反革命黑帮进行揭露和批判，那就是“以势取胜”，“以势压人”。
    对邓拓之流的牛鬼蛇神，能够同他们讲平等吗？决不能够！对于他们的一切反党反社会主义罪行，我们都要彻底清算。对于他们放出的株株毒草，我们都要彻底批判。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理，同资产阶级的一切谬论的斗争，根本谈不上什么“平等”。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”（《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》）古往今来，在阶级社会里，不是这个统治阶级压迫那个被统治阶级，就是那个统治阶级压迫这个被统治阶级，从来就不允许有什么“平等”，也没有过什么“平等”。在旧中国，哪个统治阶级对我们工人、农民是“平等”的？今天建立了无产阶级专政，人民掌了权，反动阶级的代表人物却向我们叫嚷起“平等”来了。我们当然不能给他们什么“平等”，而是要“压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。”（《论人民民主专政》）
    对“一切事物”都要“积极开导使之顺利发展”吗？你们这个“平等”的要求，是绝对办不到的。我们要积极开导并大力扶持的，只是也只能是革命的、新生的事物，而不是也决不能是反动的、腐朽的事物。“你们堵塞事物运动发展的道路。”说得很对！对你们这种反动事物的发展道路，我们当然要“堵塞”。不塞不流。不“堵塞”反动的事物，就谈不到扶持革命的事物。不“堵塞”资产阶级思想，就谈不到发展马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。不“堵塞”复辟资本主义的道路，就谈不到坚持社会主义道路。一切反动阶级在“开导”反革命的事物时，不是也拚命“堵塞”一切革命的事物吗？赫鲁晓夫修正主义者就是积极“开导”你们很感兴趣的那些资产阶级自由化的东西，竭力“堵塞”马克思列宁主义，大反斯大林；其结果，是使世界上第一个社会主义国家变颜色。你们自己的所作所为，不是也在证明着这一点吗？
    想要我们对于你们反党反社会主义的事物大大“开导”，毫不“堵塞”，想要我们对“一切事物”都“一视同仁”，是什么意思？说穿了，你们并不只是要赚得通行无阻的绿灯，平起平坐的权利；而是要用你们的软刀硬棍来打倒党的领导，推翻无产阶级专政，彻底改变我们社会主义和共产主义的方向。你们所希望的，绝不是什么“人人平等”，而是翻转来的不平等，即重新骑到我们的头上，把人民大众变成牛鬼蛇神的奴隶。
    毛主席教导我们：“在国际国内尚有阶级和阶级斗争存在的时代，夺取了国家权力的工人阶级和人民大众，必须镇压一切反革命阶级、集团和个人对于革命的反抗，制止他们的复辟活动，禁止一切反革命分子利用言论自由去达到他们的反革命目的。”邓拓黑帮们，对你们这种反党反社会主义的事物，我们决不会“积极开导”，也决不会“一视同仁”！我们是“堵塞”定了！
    那些“权威人士”们所强调的抹煞了阶级内容的“放”，和不分敌我的“与人为善”，同邓拓的“积极开导”、“一视同仁”，都是一脉相承，没有什么不同，只不过是换了一个名词而已。你们一唱一和，无非是要故意把水搅浑，混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争目标，保护大量毒草不受批判，并放手让其出笼。这不正是说明你们抗拒党和毛主席的指示，抵制社会主义文化大革命吗？
    邓拓黑帮不是骂我们“依靠权势”、“以势取胜”吗？那些所谓的“权威人士”，不是也斥责我们“不要象学阀一样以势压人”吗？这种恶意攻击或虚声恫吓，也是阻挡不住革命人民对你们的揭露和批判的。什么“以势压人”等等，同帝国主义、现代修正主义所说的“霸权主义”、“极权政府”是一个意思，是一种“录音转播”或“翻版重印”。这些才是真正的“陈词滥调”，我们已经听惯了。“以势压人”是不是正确，要看依的是什么“势”，压的是什么“人”。毛主席教导我们：“剥削者和反革命者无论何时何地总是少数，被剥削者和革命者总是多数，因此，后者的专政就有充分的道理，而前者则总是理亏的。”如果是依靠人民之势，实行人民之权，来压人民的敌人，就是完全正确，十分必要的，我们从来也就是这样做的。如果是依靠资产阶级的“权威”之势，来压人民大众，剥夺人民的发言权，那就是反动行为，必须“立即取缔，予以制裁”，这本来就是无产阶级专政的重要使命。
    嘴里在喊着什么“平等”、“平等”，实际上“依靠权势”、盗窃名义，用什么“党性”、“组织纪律”来打击那些坚决执行党和毛主席指示的革命者的是谁呢？抛出了几百篇毒草，并且自诩为“一字不空”、“字字是炮弹”、“讲得很干净，不留痕迹”，却不许革命人民说一个不字的，又是谁呢？是谁“依靠权势”，对揭发批判邓拓等反党分子的稿件，长期扣压，百般刁难，挖眼穿心，改头换面呢？是谁在“三家村”成员吴晗的反动政治面目已被揭露的时候，还在发号施令，奔走游说，只许人们谈学术，不许人们谈政治；或只许人们批吴晗，不许人们揭邓拓呢？是谁对一切牛鬼蛇神施以仁爱，而对一切革命人民却视如寇仇呢？难道所有这些，都是邓拓和他的支持者们对革命人民的“平等”吗？
    毛主席一向教导我们，凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护，凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。资产阶级的“平等”，是和无产阶级专政势不两立的。一切提倡这种“平等”的言论，不论是过去的还是现在的，不论是出自邓拓之口还是出自什么人之口，统统都是谬论，都要彻底揭穿，并把它打得粉碎。至于我们的无产阶级专政，不论敌人咒骂是“独裁”也好，“极权政府”也好，革命的人民总是要象保护眼珠一样地坚决捍卫它。“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”（《为什么要讨论白皮书》）我们要牢牢记住毛主席的话，坚决捍卫这个护身传家的法宝！
    “我们说的是‘在真理面前’人人平等嘛。”你们用“在真理面前”这个“漂亮”而“动听”的词句，能够掩盖得了这个虚伪口号的反动实质吗？我们要问：你们所说的这个“真理”，是什么样的“真理”呢？是超阶级的“真理”吗？在阶级还存在的社会中，这种超阶级的“真理”从来就不曾有过，有的只是阶级的真理。是无产阶级的真理吗？对无产阶级的真理，马克思主义的真理，你们什么时候承认过？什么时候“平等”地对待过？革命人民坚决拥护的毛泽东思想这个当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，不是一直在被你们诬之为“牛皮”、“空话”、“陈词滥调”、“主观主义”和“教条主义”，应当“完全休息”的吗？你们放出的支支毒箭，灵魂深处的种种仇恨，不都是集中到反对和抗拒毛泽东思想上面吗？
    当你们的反党反社会主义毒草受到批判的时候，你们搬弄“真理”这个名目，打出“在真理面前人人平等”这面破旗，不过是要以此为幌子，贩卖你们资产阶级谬论的私货。要人们把你们的一套谬论当作“真理”，把你们的反党言行当作“真理的表现”，把你们自己当作“真理的化身”。这就是不许革命人民批判你们的大量毒草，不许革命人民揭露你们的反党阴谋，也就是只许你们对党和社会主义猖狂进攻，不许我们进行任何反击。而你们最主要最根本的目的，则是企图利用这个反动的、虚伪的口号，反对和抗拒毛泽东思想的真理，否定毛泽东思想的权威，以便大搞你们的资产阶级自由化，实现你们复辟资本主义的美梦。
    对毛泽东思想这个伟大的真理，不同的阶级抱有不同的态度。在无产阶级和一切革命人民看来，毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳，是指导阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的战无不胜的武器。他们热爱它，学习它，运用它。而在一切反动派看来，则是眼中钉，肉中刺。他们仇恨它，诋毁它，攻击它。他们害怕毛泽东思想，如同妖魔鬼怪之惧怕太阳。帝国主义是这样，现代修正主义是这样，邓拓黑帮及其支持者也是这样。因为毛泽东思想的真理，同他们那一套资产阶级的、修正主义的谬论，是针锋相对的。因为在毛泽东思想这个真理面前，他们的一切罪恶阴谋都难以得逞。因为革命的人民掌握了毛泽东思想的武器，一切牛鬼蛇神就无处藏身。
    敌人是我们最好的教员，它从反面向我们说明了学习和掌握毛泽东思想的重要性、迫切性。目前，在思想领域里和文化领域里，无产阶级和资产阶级所进行的这场斗争，是你死我活的斗争。敌人是不会甘心失败的，必然要作最后的挣扎。在这样激烈、复杂的斗争中，只有真正用毛泽东思想把自己彻底武装起来，才能识破敌人的种种阴谋，戳穿敌人的种种骗局，巩固和夺取一个又一个的阵地。学习和掌握毛泽东思想，不但是取得这场斗争胜利的根本，是取得社会主义革命和建设彻底胜利的根本，也是取得世界革命胜利的根本。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地学习毛泽东思想的真理吧！一切牛鬼蛇神，都将被掌握了毛泽东思想的革命人民统统扫除干净！
