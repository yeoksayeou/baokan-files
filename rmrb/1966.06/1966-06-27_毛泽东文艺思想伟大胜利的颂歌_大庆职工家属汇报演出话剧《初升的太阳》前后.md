Ode to the Great Victory of Mao Zedong's Literary Thought
—Before and After the Performance of the Play "The Rising Sun" by the Families of Workers in Daqing

After successfully performing the play "The Rising Sun" six times, the families of workers in Daqing recently left Beijing and returned to the Daqing oil field. However, the spectacle of workers, peasants, and soldiers performing a large-scale play for the first time and causing a sensation in the capital's theater world left an unforgettable impression on the broad audience.

Since the beginning of this year, "The Rising Sun" has been performed 133 times in Beijing, with an audience of over 220,000. The broad audience enthusiastically praised it, saying that this play, whether in content or performance, can indeed be called a rising sun.

New things, the rising sun

After the curtain rises, with the bright song "Daqing families make revolution, Chairman Mao's teachings are in our hearts...", "The Rising Sun" presents a brand-new revolutionary scene to the audience: Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the families of workers in Daqing are no longer consumers detached from collective production and labor, but are organized to engage in collective production and labor, embarking on the road of revolutionization. Their spiritual outlook has undergone a fundamental change, from the past "looking at a room, thinking of husband and children" to now reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Standing on the oil field, looking at all of China, thinking of the whole world, together with the workers of the oil field, actively participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Under the guidance of the policy of "combining industry and agriculture, combining city and countryside, benefiting production, and facilitating life" indicated by the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, the construction of the mining area is no longer an old-style mining area detached from the countryside and agricultural production, but a new-type socialist mining area that has both industry and agriculture, is both like a city and like a countryside, and vigorously promotes half-work (agriculture) half-study schools. Workers and their families all participate in collective production and labor, which is conducive to gradually narrowing the three major differences.

The new thing with a great future and strong vitality presented on the stage is a song of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought performed by the people of Daqing armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The performers of "The Rising Sun" are not professional actors, but ordinary workers' families and oil workers. But relying on Mao Zedong Thought, they successfully stepped onto the stage of large-scale drama and were warmly welcomed and praised by the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers audience. Almost every performance, many audience members shed tears of excitement and gave long, enthusiastic applause. Sometimes, after the play, many audience members did not want to leave the theater and insisted on having them come out to speak, introducing the revolutionary spirit and experience of Daqing. After watching the play, some audience members rushed backstage, went to their residences to visit them, and some audience members spontaneously held discussion meetings to discuss the education they received from the play. Some audience members even treated the characters on stage as their leaders and comrades-in-arms, finding them to report their thoughts and seek help. This moving scene of on-stage and off-stage hearts connected, actors and audience emotions fused, reflects the new situation in our country's cultural and artistic field where workers, peasants, and soldiers perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and workers, peasants, and soldiers watch workers, peasants, and soldiers, shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

It is worth noting that some so-called "experts" and "authorities" had to admit that they performed well in front of the facts, but at the same time, they firmly denied that they were workers' families, saying that "ordinary workers' families and workers could not perform so well!"

But facts cannot be erased. It is these ordinary laborers who, with their successful performance, gave those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" a resounding slap in the face.

No matter how much "experts" and "authorities" oppose it and how unhappy they are, the performance of large-scale drama by the families of workers in Daqing still appeared according to the inevitable law of historical development. It shows the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought; at the same time, it once again declares to the people: The era of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country taking the stage of revolutionary literature and becoming the masters of culture has begun!

Long live the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and destroy the arrogance of bourgeois "authorities"!

"The Rising Sun" was created under the leadership of the Petroleum Industry Department and the Party Committee of the Daqing Oil Field, by drama workers and the families and workers of Daqing together.

In mid-December last year, when the Daqing Party Committee decided that the families of workers in Daqing would perform themselves, various units and departments in the mining area immediately selected a batch of families and workers with good thoughts and production, and organized these "actors" in a few days.

In recent years, many drama troupes have performed in Daqing and performed many good modern revolutionary plays. However, what the families and workers felt unsatisfied with was that there were few performances based on the life of Daqing, and they could not "use their own things to boost revolutionary spirit." Workers and their families were particularly indignant that some art troupes also performed some bad plays in Daqing and screened some bad films, spreading the poisonous thoughts of capitalism and feudalism.

The workers and families of Daqing understand that literature and art are an important battlefield. If the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will. Workers and their families creating and performing themselves is to establish the newness of socialism and the uniqueness of the proletariat, to create and flourish revolutionary literature and art, and to carry out the class struggle of eliminating bourgeoisie and promoting proletariat in the cultural field.

In the past few years, the people of Daqing have resolutely implemented the literary line stipulated by Chairman Mao, and continuously developed their mass literature and art in the process of developing the oil field and building the mining area. Near the oil wells, in the workshops, and in the fields and ditches of the families' production teams, they are the stages for creating and performing revolutionary literature and art. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, and they sing loudly about the new characters and new ideas that have rapidly grown up on the oil field. The whole mining area presents a lively and lively situation of "singing everywhere, having evening parties every month, and having programs in every team." When new achievements are created in production, when celebrating victories, when summarizing the year and celebrating a bumper harvest, the Daqing mining area always holds activities to report to the Party and Chairman Mao. Workers and their families compile the outstanding good people, good deeds, and good thoughts into quick-talk, singing, reciting poetry, and one-act plays, and perform them on stage. These programs are first compiled, performed, and watched by various grassroots units, and then selected level by level, and reported to higher and external units. Each reporting activity is actually a large-scale inspection of mass literature and art activities from the bottom up and from the top down in the entire mining area. In "The Rising Sun," the five-good family member and production team leader Qu Shuqing, who plays the role of Tie Dan's mother, is a cadre who has grown up in such mass literature and art activities. Recently, in the singing disc released nationwide, there is a new song "Daqing Women Learn from Dazhai," whose lyrics were created by Qu Shuqing.

From performing small-scale literature and art programs to performing the large-scale drama "The Rising Sun," Daqing people have taken an important step forward on the road of socialist cultural revolution. Some so-called "experts" and "authorities" did not believe they could do this. However, the people of Daqing said: The bourgeois lords look down on us, do we also look down on ourselves? Why can't workers, peasants, and soldiers touch large-scale drama? When they realized the great revolutionary significance of workers, peasants, and soldiers taking the stage of large-scale drama to perform their struggle life and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, a sense of proletarian revolutionary responsibility suddenly turned into a tremendous determination to move mountains and overturn seas: We will blaze a trail where no one has gone before! The more the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" look down on us, the more we will do it! We must take the stage of large-scale drama, long live the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and destroy the arrogance of bourgeois "authorities"!

The workers and families of the Daqing mining area all regard the rehearsal of "The Rising Sun" as a revolution for workers, peasants, and soldiers to take the stage of large-scale drama, and as a revolutionary innovation to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary line. Therefore, during the rehearsal, many people voluntarily ran to the rehearsal place, some acted as volunteer "directors," and some acted as volunteer "servants." When the performance needed to add some scenery and props, some families and workers silently made them and sent them to the door; when it was mentioned that a certain part of the play was difficult to perform, the families and workers watching the rehearsal would immediately discuss it, helping to design actions and modify lines. Many families and workers even traveled far to introduce to the actors the true people and true events related to the roles, helping the actors to understand and shape the image of the characters. ... Many families and workers told the performers: "You work hard on stage, and we work hard off stage. We are working hard for the same cause: revolution!" The families and workers of Daqing regarded the performers as representatives of themselves to sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, and in their enthusiastic letters and phone calls, they expressed their revolutionary wishes: to long live the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage, and to destroy the arrogance of bourgeois "authorities"!

"With Mao Zedong Thought, we can do anything"

The families of workers in Daqing rehearsed "The Rising Sun" starting with the study of Chairman Mao's works.

Can workers, peasants, and soldiers not perform? Chairman Mao has long instructed: Literature and art should not only serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but should gradually become the literature and art of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The performers said happily: "It is Chairman Mao who supports us to perform on stage, and we must do it well!"

Do workers, peasants, and soldiers not have the conditions to perform? Chairman Mao has made it very clear: The hot struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the only source of all literary creation. The performers said with full confidence: "The life in the play is what we are most familiar with and love, and doing it according to Chairman Mao's instructions is definitely correct!"

The fourth scene of "The Rising Sun," which recalls bitterness and sweetness, is the most moving to the audience. When people watch the stage performance with tears, the performers are also recalling their own bitter experiences in the old society! In the play, Deng Shuqing, who plays the role of the family production team leader Xin Yuhong, was so poor before liberation that she could not open the pot at the age of five or six, and had to beg and wander with her mother. Every time she performs, she thinks of her bitter experiences in the old society and the happy life that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought her after liberation, and the strong class hatred makes her unable to control herself. The moving scene on stage of studying Chairman Mao's works, the families using Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves and transform their subjective and objective worlds, and the lines of the production team leader Guo Deying in the play, who expresses with deep feelings that "the moon cannot shine without the sun, and the families making revolution cannot lose their way without Chairman Mao's works," are all very moving. Many audience members said that without deep proletarian feelings and deep feelings from life practice, it is impossible to perform so truly and movingly.

For the performers, the life in "The Rising Sun" is their own life, the characters in the play are their comrades or themselves, and the language in the play is what they often say in their daily lives. They are in the source of literary creation mentioned by Chairman Mao and have the right to speak about literary creation.

Of course, the life on stage should be more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than actual life. Here, the performers feel that the first problem to be solved is to perform heroes and learn from heroes.

In the play, Fan Guilin, who plays the role of the team leader Guo Deying, is a saleswoman who has come to Daqing three times. She vividly shows her process of learning from Chairman Mao's works under the help of the team leader from her first unwillingness to stay in Daqing to her third participation in the revolutionary team of families. She has some specific understanding of advanced figures like Guo Deying from her own experience, and also knows that there is a big gap between her thoughts and Guo Deying. However, can this gap affect the shaping of the role? Fan Guilin thought, Guo Deying is a typical image of Daqing families, an heroic figure armed with Mao Zedong Thought, whether the role is like or not, good or not, is not a personal problem, but a big problem of whether Daqing spirit can be reflected and expressed, and whether the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought can be expressed. Therefore, she visited families who had been team leaders, read the materials of advanced figures such as Xue Guifang, and strove to learn Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles. She studied while checking herself, gradually narrowing the gap with Guo Deying through her own ideological transformation. Finally, she successfully shaped the tall image of this advanced figure on stage. Fan Guilin and some other performers in the troupe all felt that to perform well the heroic figures of the socialist era, they must strive to learn Chairman Mao's works and grasp ideological transformation; only in this way can they raise their actual life to a higher level and meet the requirements of being more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal. At the same time, learning Chairman Mao's works and grasping ideological transformation also became a great driving force for them to break through difficulties and move forward in the rehearsal.

The families participating in the performance encountered many difficulties when rehearsing "The Rising Sun." They had never performed before and had no experience in performing, which was an unfavorable condition. But not having performed before and not having those bourgeois and revisionist frameworks and habits, is it not also a favorable condition? What "director-centered theory," what "strict division of labor" theory of scriptwriters, directors, actors, and stage workers, and so on, they did not care about any of that, but resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao didn't say that the people have unlimited creativity? A "stinky cobbler" can't do it, but several or dozens of "stinky cobblers" can do it! It is precisely because of this that they insisted on the mass line in rehearsing "The Rising Sun," pooling their wisdom and collectively creating. Everyone was a scriptwriter, modifying lines; everyone was a director, designing actions; everyone was a stage worker, preparing scenery and props. As long as it is beneficial to propagating Mao Zedong Thought, listen to whoever is right; as long as it is beneficial to the revolution, the division of labor can be broken, what leading roles and supporting roles, what front stage and backstage, everything can be done. They did not care about the performance art and performance techniques of revisionism and bourgeoisie at all. They only thought of one thing, that is: How to bring out the great power of Mao Zedong Thought's invincibility, how to bring out the revolutionary fighting life of the people of Daqing. Therefore, their performance, with a strong life atmosphere and strong revolutionary passion, showed the fighting style and creative spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers in breaking the old and establishing the new in the arts.

Throughout the rehearsal and performance process, the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other relevant quotations on ideological work and literary work in Chairman Mao's works have been repeatedly studied by each performer several times, dozens of times, and even hundreds of times. They studied while performing; they performed under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and regarded the performance as a glorious fighting task to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They realized that labor is to make revolution, and performing revolutionary plays is also to make revolution. Mao Zedong Thought aroused their spirit of "if there are conditions, if there are no conditions, create conditions and go up," and Mao Zedong Thought inspired their tenacious will of "even if it costs ten pounds of flesh, we will not lose an ounce of the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers." The performers knew in their hearts that they were fighting for the spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they were going to prove with their practice that as long as there is Mao Zedong Thought, workers, peasants, and soldiers can not only drill wells well and farm well, but also perform well, and can do anything!

The facts are indeed like this. "The Rising Sun" took only 12 days from the beginning of memorizing lines and rehearsing to taking the stage. Many drama workers admitted that such a rehearsal speed and quality are very difficult for ordinary professional troupes to achieve.

The performance of the families of workers in Daqing proved with revolutionary practice that workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought can not only create countless miracles in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, but can also create new socialist culture and art that express revolutionary struggle life, and become the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Fire at the anti-party, anti-socialist black line

After the families of workers in Daqing ended their reporting performance in Beijing, they were also invited to perform at an art unit. This art unit had spread some poisonous weeds against the Party and socialism in the past few years, and some people were still resisting the literary direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and socialism indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and were full of blame and disdain for mass literature and art. After learning about these situations, the comrades discussed and rubbed their fists.

A comrade said: "You guys, the bourgeois 'authorities,' don't look down on us, right? We proletarians don't even put you in our eyes!"

Another comrade said: "I think tonight we are going to propagate and defend Chairman Mao's thoughts, face to face with capitalism and revisionism, and we must fight this battle well!"

"Right, we must fight this battle well!" Another comrade followed: "Let those bourgeois lords see that without them, we workers, peasants, and soldiers can perform better!"

This performance was a great success. A comrade who participated in the performance talked about her mood at that time: "When I was performing, I was full of anger against those 'experts' and 'authorities.' I thought, you guys don't cause trouble and act arrogantly anymore, humph! If you do those bad things against the Party and socialism, we will drive you off the stage, and we can go on stage!"

As the socialist cultural revolution deepens, they saw from the materials exposed in the newspapers that there is a black line opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and saw the evil activities of the black gang of Deng Tuo and others fiercely attacking the Party and socialism, and one by one, their hearts burned with anger. They said, the class enemy regards Mao Zedong Thought as an eye sore, and we must sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought loudly! The class enemy regards the stage as a tool to propagate revisionism and restore capitalism, and we must turn the stage into a battlefield to defend the Party, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend socialism! For a few days, two performances were arranged for one day, and some comrades also caught a cold, but they never complained or got tired, and insisted on performing on stage. They said: The stage is a battlefield, the actors are soldiers, the props are guns, the lines are bullets, and the performance is a battle to fire at the anti-party, anti-socialist black line. It can only be won, not lost, and must be fought to the final victory! The comrades who participated in the performance of the families of workers in Daqing said with full confidence: We want to perform, and we can perform, the masters of the proletarian cultural revolution, we have decided!

    毛泽东文艺思想伟大胜利的颂歌
    ——大庆职工家属汇报演出话剧《初升的太阳》前后
    在成功地演出了六场话剧《初升的太阳》以后，大庆职工家属不久前已经离开北京，返回大庆矿区。但是，作为工农兵群众第一次登台演出大型话剧轰动首都剧坛的盛况，却在广大观众中留下了难忘的印象。
    今年开春以来的三个多月中，《初升的太阳》在北京总共上演了一百三十三场，观众达二十二万人次之多。广大观众热烈赞扬说，这出话剧不论是内容还是演出，都可以称得上是一轮初升的太阳。
    新生的事物，初升的太阳
    帷幕揭开后，随着“大庆家属闹革命，毛主席的教导记在心……”的嘹亮歌声，《初升的太阳》把一幅崭新的革命图景展现在观众面前：在毛泽东思想哺育下的大庆职工家属，不再是脱离集体生产劳动的消费者，而是组织起来从事集体生产劳动，走上了革命化的道路。她们的精神面貌发生了根本变化，从过去“眼看一间屋子，心想丈夫孩子”，变为现在的读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。站在油田上，眼望全中国，心想全世界，同油田的职工一起，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。他们在党中央领导同志指示的“工农结合，城乡结合，有利生产，方便生活”方针指导下，进行的矿区建设，不再是脱离农村、脱离农业生产的旧式矿区，而是一个既有工业，又有农业，既象城市，也象乡村，大办半工（农）半读学校，职工和家属都参加集体生产劳动，有利于逐步缩小三大差别的社会主义新型矿区。
    舞台上表现出来的这一具有远大发展前途和强大生命力的新生事物，是一曲由毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆人所演奏的毛泽东思想伟大胜利的颂歌。《初升的太阳》的演出者，不是专业演员，而是普通的职工家属和石油工人。但他们依靠毛泽东思想，成功地踏上了大型话剧舞台，受到了广大工农兵观众极其热烈的欢迎和赞扬。几乎每一场演出，都有许许多多观众流下了激动的热泪，对演出报以长时间的、热烈的掌声。有时候，戏演完了，许多观众还不肯退场，非要他们出来讲话，介绍大庆的革命精神和经验不可。看戏以后，有些观众跑上后台，赶到住所去探望他们，有些观众自动开座谈会，畅谈从戏里受到的教育。还有些观众，干脆把台上的人物当作自己的领导和战友，找着去汇报思想，争取帮助。这种台上和台下心连心、演员和观众感情交融的动人情景，反映了我国文化艺术事业上出现的工农兵演工农兵、工农兵看工农兵的崭新局面，闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。
    值得指出的是，有些所谓“专家”“权威”，在事实面前不得不承认他们演得好的同时，却又断然否认他们是家属和工人，说什么“普通家属、工人决不能演得这样好！”
    但事实是抹煞不了的。就是这些普通的劳动者，用他们成功的演出，打了那些资产阶级“专家”“权威”一记响亮的耳光。
    不管“专家”“权威”怎样反对，怎样不高兴，大庆职工家属演出大型话剧，还是按照历史发展的必然规律出现了。它显示了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利；同时，它再一次向人们宣告：我国工农兵群众登上革命文艺舞台、成为文化主人的时代，开始了！
    长工农兵的志气，灭资产阶级“权威”的威风
    《初升的太阳》，是在石油工业部和大庆油田党组织领导下，由戏剧工作者和大庆的家属、工人一起创作出来的。
    去年十二月中旬，当大庆党委决定由大庆职工家属自己演自己的时候，矿区各单位、各部门立即选送了一批思想好、生产好的家属和工人，几天之内就把这些“演员”们组织起来了。
    近几年来，有不少戏剧团体到过大庆，演过不少好的革命现代戏。但家属和工人们感到不满足的是，这些演出取材于大庆生活的节目不多，不能“用自己的事儿，鼓革命的劲儿”。工人和家属们特别气愤的是，有的文艺团体还在大庆演了一些坏戏，也放映了一些坏电影，散布资本主义、封建主义的思想毒素。
    大庆的工人和家属们懂得，文艺是一个重要阵地。无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就要去占领。工人、家属自己创作、自己演出，就是要标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，创造和繁荣革命文艺，就是要在文化领域里开展兴无灭资的阶级斗争。
    过去几年，大庆人坚决执行毛主席规定的文艺路线，在开发油田、建设矿区的过程中，不断地发展着自己的群众文艺。油井旁，车间里，家属生产队的田边地头，都是他们创作和演出革命文艺节目的舞台。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，热情地歌颂毛泽东思想，他们放声高歌油田上迅速成长起来的新人物、新思想，整个矿区出现了一个“处处有歌声，月月有晚会，队队有节目”的生动活泼的局面。当生产上创造了新的成就、欢庆胜利的时候，当年终总结评比、庆贺丰收的时候，大庆矿区总要举行向党、向毛主席报捷的活动。职工、家属们把突出的好人、好事、好思想，编成快板、演唱、朗诵诗、独幕剧，上台演出。这些节目先由各基层单位自己编、自己演、自己看，然后逐级选拔，向上、向外单位汇报演出。每一次报捷活动，实际上是全矿区自下而上、自上而下的群众性文艺活动的大检阅。在《初升的太阳》里扮演铁蛋妈的五好家属、生产队指导员曲淑琴，就是在这种群众性文艺活动中成长起来的一名积极分子。最近在全国发行的唱片中，有一首《大庆妇女学大寨》的新歌，歌词就是曲淑琴创作的。
    从演小型文艺节目到演大型话剧《初升的太阳》，是大庆人在社会主义文化革命大道上向前迈出的重要一步。一些所谓“专家”“权威”不相信他们能做到这一点。但是，大庆人说：资产阶级老爷看不起我们，难道我们自己也看不起自己吗？为什么大型话剧工农兵群众就不能沾边？当他们认识到工农兵群众登上大型话剧舞台表现自己的斗争生活、宣传毛泽东思想的重大革命意义时，一种无产阶级的革命责任感，顿时变成了移山倒海的强大决心：前人没有走过的路我们要闯！资产阶级“专家”“权威”们越是看不起我们，我们越是要干！我们一定要登上大型话剧舞台，长工农兵的志气，灭资产阶级“权威”的威风！
    大庆矿区的职工和家属们，都把排演《初升的太阳》看作是工农兵群众登上大型话剧舞台的一场革命，看作是坚决执行毛主席的文艺路线的革命创举。因此在排戏的时候，许多人自动跑到排演的地方，有的当义务“导演”，有的当义务“勤务员”。当演出需要增加个什么布景、道具的时候，一些家属、工人不声不响地做好，送上门来；当谈到某一段戏难演的时候，在场看排练的家属、工人就随时议论起来，帮助设计动作，修改台词。不少家属、工人甚至远路跑来，向演员介绍和角色有关的真人、真事，帮助演员理解、塑造人物形象。……许多家属和工人跟演出的同志说：“你们在台上使劲，我们在台下使劲，咱们使的是一个劲儿：革命！”大庆的家属和工人们把演出的同志当作代表自己来歌颂毛泽东思想的宣传员，他们在热情洋溢的来信和电话中，表达了自己的革命祝愿：要在舞台上长工农兵的志气，灭资产阶级“权威”的威风！
    “有了毛泽东思想，我们什么都能干”
    大庆职工家属排演《初升的太阳》，是从学习毛主席著作开始的。
    工农兵自己不能演戏吗？毛主席早就指示：文艺不仅要为工农兵服务，而且要逐渐成为工农兵自己的文艺。演出的同志们高兴地说：“是毛主席支持我们上台演戏的，我们一定要好好干！”
    工农兵没有演戏的条件吗？毛主席讲得很清楚：工农兵群众火热的斗争生活，是一切文艺创作的唯一源泉。演出的同志们信心百倍地说：“戏里的生活我们最熟悉、最热爱，照毛主席指示的去做，准没错！”
    《初升的太阳》第四场忆苦思甜的一段戏，是观众们最受感动的。当人们含着泪观看台上声泪俱下的表演时，也是扮演者在以自己的亲身经历控诉旧社会啊！在戏里扮演家属生产队长辛玉红的家属缝补工邓淑琴，解放前家里穷得揭不开锅，五六岁就随着母亲到处乞讨、流浪。每一场演出时，她想到自己在旧社会的辛酸经历和解放后共产党、毛主席给她带来的幸福生活，强烈的阶级爱憎就使她难以控制自己。舞台上学习毛主席著作的动人场景，家属们用毛泽东思想武装自己改造主观世界和客观世界的斗争场面，以及戏里的生产队指导员郭德英，用深挚的感情说出“月亮离开太阳就不能发光，家属闹革命离开毛主席著作就要迷失方向”这些话，都是十分激动人心的。许多观众说，没有深厚的无产阶级感情和来自生活实践的深切感受，是不可能演得那样真切感人的。
    对演出的同志们来说，《初升的太阳》里的生活就是他们自己的生活，戏里的人物就是他们的同志或他们自己，戏里的语言就是他们平日经常讲的话。他们置身在毛主席所说的文艺创作的源泉之中，对文艺创作是最有发言权的。
    当然，在舞台上演出的生活应该比实际生活更集中，更典型，更理想。在这里，演出的同志感到首先必须解决的，是一个演英雄、学英雄的问题。
    在戏里扮演指导员郭德英的范桂林，是一个三进大庆的家属售货员。她由第一次不愿留在大庆到第三次参加到家属革命化的队伍，生动地说明了她在生产队指导员帮助下活学活用毛主席著作的过程。她从自己的经历中，对指导员郭德英这样的先进人物有一些具体了解，也知道自己的思想同郭德英有很大差距。但是，能够因为自己的这个差距使角色的塑造受到影响吗？范桂林想，郭德英是大庆家属的典型形象，是毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，演得象不象、好不好，不是自己个人的问题，而是能不能把大庆精神反映表现出来、能不能把毛泽东思想的伟大胜利表现出来的大问题。于是，她访问当过指导员的家属，阅读家属标兵薛桂芳等人先进事迹的材料，努力学习毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章。她一边学习，一边对照检查自己，通过自己的思想改造，逐渐缩小同郭德英的差距。最后，她终于在舞台上比较成功地塑造了这个先进人物的高大形象。范桂林和演出队另外一些同志都体会到，要演好社会主义时代的英雄人物，必须努力学习毛主席著作，抓紧思想改造；只有这样，才能把自己的实际生活提高一步，达到更集中、更典型、更理想的要求。同时，学习毛主席著作和抓紧思想改造，又成为他们在排演中冲破道道难关、不断前进的巨大动力。
    参加演出的家属，在排演《初升的太阳》时，遇到了许多困难。没演过戏，没有演戏的经验，是个不利条件。但没演过戏，没有那些资产阶级的、修正主义的框框套套，陈规陋习，岂不也是有利的条件吗？什么“导演中心论”呀，什么编剧、导演、演员、舞台工作人员“严格分工”论呀，等等，他们根本不管那一套，而是坚决按毛主席的指示办事。毛主席不是说，人民群众有无限的创造力吗？一个“臭皮匠”干不成，几个、几十个“臭皮匠”总能干成吧！正是这样，他们在排演《初升的太阳》时，始终坚持群众路线的做法，群策群力，集体创作。大家当编剧，都来修改台词；大家当导演，都来设计动作；大家当舞台工作人员，都来筹备布景和道具。只要对宣传毛泽东思想有利，谁说得对听谁的；只要对革命有利，分工界限可以打破，什么主角配角、前台后台，什么都可以干。他们根本不理睬修正主义的、资产阶级的表演艺术、表演技巧。他们想到的只有一条，那就是：怎样才能把毛泽东思想战无不胜的巨大威力表现出来，怎样才能把大庆人的革命战斗生活表现出来。所以他们的演出，以浓厚的生活气息和强烈的革命激情，显示了工农兵群众在艺术上破旧立新的战斗风格和创造精神。
    在整个排练和演出过程中，毛主席著作中的“老三篇”和其他有关思想工作、文艺工作的语录，参加演出的每个同志都反复学习过几遍、十几遍以至于几十遍。他们一边学习，一边演戏；他们在毛泽东思想指导下演戏，又把演戏当作是宣传毛泽东思想的光荣的战斗任务。他们认识到：劳动是干革命，演革命戏也是干革命。毛泽东思想唤起了他们那种“有条件上，没有条件创造条件也要上”的雄心壮志，毛泽东思想激发了他们“宁肯身上掉十斤肉，决不让工农兵的志气丢一分”的顽强毅力。参加演出的同志心里清楚，他们是在给工农兵群众争气，他们是要用自己的实践证明：只要有了毛泽东思想，工农兵群众不仅能打好井，种好田，也能演好戏，什么事情都能干！
    事实果然如此。《初升的太阳》从开始背台词、排练，到登台演出，只用了十二天时间。许多戏剧工作者都承认：这样的排演速度和排演质量，一般专业剧团是很难做到的。
    大庆职工家属的演出以革命的实践证明：掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵群众，不仅能够在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中创造出无数奇迹，而且完全可以创造出表现革命斗争生活的社会主义新文化、新艺术，成为无产阶级文化革命的主力军。
    向反党反社会主义黑线开火
    大庆职工家属结束在北京的汇报演出以后，还应邀到一个文艺单位去演出。这个文艺单位在前几年曾经放出过一些反党反社会主义的毒草，有些人对党和毛主席指示的为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的文艺方向至今还是对抗，对群众文艺更是百般责难，看不上眼。了解到这些情况以后，同志们议论纷纷，磨拳擦掌。
    一个同志说：“你们这帮资产阶级‘权威’看不起我们不是？我们无产阶级还不把你们这些人放在眼里呢！”
    另一个同志说：“我看，咱们今天晚上是宣传和保卫毛主席的思想，面对面地跟资本主义、修正主义斗，我们一定要打好这一仗！”
    “对，要打好这一仗！”又一个同志接着表示：“要让那些资产阶级老爷看看，没有他们，我们工农兵能把戏演得更好！”这场演出获得了很大的成功。参加演出的一个同志谈她当时的心情说：“我演戏的时候，对那些什么‘专家’呀、‘权威’呀，正窝着一肚子火。我想，你们这些家伙别再兴风作浪、神气活现的，哼！要是你们干那些反党反社会主义的坏事，就要把你们从台上赶下来，我们自己可以上台！”
    随着社会主义文化大革命的不断深入，他们从报上揭发出来的大批材料中，看到了有一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线，看到了邓拓等黑帮向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的罪恶活动，一个个心头燃起了愤怒的火焰。他们说，阶级敌人把毛泽东思想看作眼中钉，我们更要放声歌颂毛泽东思想！阶级敌人把舞台当作宣扬修正主义、复辟资本主义的工具，我们就要把舞台变成保卫党、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫社会主义的阵地！有几天，一天安排两场戏，部分同志又患了感冒，但是他们从来不叫苦，不喊累，坚持在舞台上演出。他们说：舞台就是战场，演员就是战士，道具就是枪炮，台词就是子弹，演出就是向反党反社会主义黑线开火的一场战斗。只能打胜，不能打败，必须坚持到最后胜利！大庆职工家属参加演出的同志满怀信心地说：我们要演戏，我们也能演戏，无产阶级文化大革命的主人，我们是做定了！
