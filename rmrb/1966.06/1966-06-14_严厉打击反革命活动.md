    Resolutely Crack Down on Counter-Revolutionary Activities
　  By Our Staff Commentator
    The counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing, who murdered a foreign friend, was sentenced to death yesterday by the Supreme People's Court and executed immediately. This counter-revolutionary element, who undermined the friendship between the people of our country and the people of the world, has been subjected to the most severe punishment by the government.
    This counter-revolutionary case occurred at a time when class struggle at home was fiercely underway. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is pushing our country's socialist revolution to a new stage. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are sweeping away all monsters and demons. However, the overthrown exploiting classes are by no means reconciled to their defeat and will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history, and are bound to make a deathbed struggle. Yang Guoqing's counter-revolutionary case of murdering an international friend is a reflection of this deathbed struggle.
    This counter-revolutionary case shows that counter-revolutionary elements who adhere to the reactionary class stand and refuse to repent must adopt all kinds of insidious and vicious means, including such fierce means as Yang Guoqing's murder of international friends, to fight against us. This is determined by the nature of the exploiting and reactionary classes. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The hidden counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated will not give up, they will surely seize the opportunity to make trouble. The U.S. imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are still constantly sending agents to our country to carry out sabotage activities. Even if the original counter-revolutionaries are eliminated, some new counter-revolutionaries may appear. If we lose our vigilance, we will be greatly deceived and suffer great losses. Wherever counter-revolutionaries appear to make trouble, they should be resolutely eliminated." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance against class enemies and never be careless.
    Our country's proletarian dictatorship is incomparably strong and consolidated. Any counter-revolutionary element who dares to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities is bound to be met with a devastating blow.
    The evil attempt of the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing to undermine the friendship between the people of our country and the people of the world has completely failed. Mr. Bakari Traoré, head of the Malian journalistic delegation who was unfortunately injured, severely rebuked this counter-revolutionary criminal. He said: "Your crime will never affect the friendship between China and Mali. Even if I am killed, it will not affect the relationship between China and Mali. You don't love your motherland, but I love your motherland!" Mr. Bakari Traoré's words fully express the sincere friendship of the Malian people towards the Chinese people, and also fully express the sincere friendship of the revolutionary people of all countries towards the Chinese people. Because this friendship is formed by the people of our country and the revolutionary people of all countries in the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, and cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces at home and abroad. Anyone who attempts to undermine this fighting friendship can only expose himself as an enemy of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and can only further sharpen the eyes of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and make this fighting friendship even stronger.
    Finally, we extend our deep sympathy to Mr. Bakari Traoré and Mrs. Maro, First Secretary of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, who were injured by the counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing! We wish the friendship between the Chinese people and the Malian people, and the Chinese people and the people of the German Democratic Republic, to be further consolidated and developed!

    严厉打击反革命活动
　  本报评论员
    杀害外国朋友的反革命罪犯杨国庆，已于昨日经最高人民法院判处死刑，并且立即执行。这个破坏我国人民同世界人民友谊的反革命分子，已经受到政府最严厉的惩罚。
    这个反革命案件是在国内阶级斗争激烈进行的时刻发生的。无产阶级文化大革命，正在把我国社会主义革命推向一个新的阶段。广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。但是，被推翻了的剥削阶级，他们决不甘心于自己的失败，决不会自动退出历史舞台，必然作垂死的挣扎。杨国庆杀害国际朋友的反革命案件，就是这种垂死挣扎的反映。
    这个反革命案件说明，坚持反动阶级立场、死不悔改的反革命分子，一定要采取各种阴险毒辣的手段，包括象杨国庆杀害国际朋友这样凶狠的手段，来同我们进行斗争。这是剥削阶级反动阶级本性所决定的。毛主席教导我们：“没有肃清的暗藏的反革命分子是不会死心的，他们必定要乘机捣乱。美帝国主义者和蒋介石集团经常还在派遣特务到我们这里来进行破坏活动。原有的反革命分子肃清了，还可能出现一些新的反革命分子。如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。不管什么地方出现反革命分子捣乱，就应当坚决消灭他。”我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的教导：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。对阶级敌人一定要保持高度的警惕，决不能麻痹大意。
    我国的无产阶级专政，是无比强大和巩固的，任何反革命分子胆敢进行阴谋破坏活动，就必然遭到毁灭性的打击。
    反革命罪犯杨国庆破坏我国人民同世界人民友谊的罪恶企图完全落空了。不幸遭受伤害的马里新闻工作者代表团团长巴卡里·特拉奥雷先生严厉地训斥了这个反革命罪犯。他说：“你这种罪行，绝不会影响中国和马里之间的友谊。即使我被杀死了，也不会影响中国和马里的关系。你不爱你的祖国，我还爱你的祖国哩！”巴卡里·特拉奥雷先生的话，充分表达了马里人民对中国人民的真挚友谊，也充分表达了世界各国革命人民对中国人民的真挚友谊。因为这种友谊，是我国人民同世界各国革命人民，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争中结成的，是任何国内外的反动派破坏不了的。谁要企图破坏这种战斗友谊，就只能暴露他是中国人民和世界革命人民的敌人，就只能更加擦亮中国人民和世界革命人民的眼睛，而使这种战斗友谊更加增强。
    最后，我们向遭受反革命罪犯杨国庆伤害的巴卡里·特拉奥雷先生、德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆马罗一等秘书的夫人致以深切的慰问！祝中国人民和马里人民、中国人民和德意志民主共和国人民的友谊更加巩固和发展！
