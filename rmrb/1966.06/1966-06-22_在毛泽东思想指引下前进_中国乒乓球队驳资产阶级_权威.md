    Advancing Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought
    —China's Table Tennis Team Refutes Bourgeois "Authorities"
    Readers, this article uses this title to expose a major conspiracy of certain so-called "authorities" against Mao Zedong Thought. In 1965, after the 28th World Table Tennis Championships, an article summarizing the experience of our table tennis team was given this very title. This title truthfully reflected the fundamental reason for the rapid growth of the Chinese table tennis team. However, a vice minister of the Central Propaganda Department, who held the power of censorship, arbitrarily changed it to another title that did not mention Mao Zedong Thought at all. Now, amid the sound of drums of the socialist cultural revolution, when these so-called "authorities" have lost their power of control and have been beaten to pieces, we are reusing the title "Advancing Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."
    Recently, we interviewed the table tennis players who had returned from Japan, Cambodia, and Syria. On their way back, they read in the newspapers that Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article had been slandered by some reactionary bourgeois "authorities" as a typical example of "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism," and they were all filled with righteous indignation. When discussing the true story of why certain bourgeois "authorities" were not allowed to use the title "Advancing Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought," they could not suppress the anger in their hearts and said very indignantly, "After Chairman Mao's instruction on Xu Yinsheng's speech and after our team achieved a major victory in the 28th Championships, the bourgeois 'authorities' still dared to openly prohibit us from using Mao Zedong Thought. This is extreme audacity!" They said, "In the past few years, these bourgeois 'authority' gentlemen have not only attacked the table tennis team with these things. We have attacked them every time we win. The higher we, under the leadership of the Party, hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the more severe their attacks on us become. Obviously, the spearhead of their attacks is not directed at our small team, but at the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is absolutely not allowed. At present, a high tide of cultural revolution has risen in our country, sounding the death knell for these bourgeois 'authorities'. The era of sweeping away these monsters and demons has arrived."
    After returning to Beijing from abroad, the table tennis players, regardless of the fatigue of the journey, held discussions for days to systematically review the glorious history of the Chinese table tennis team's continuous progress through the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and gave the bourgeois "authorities" a fierce rebuff with ironclad facts.
    Zhuang Jiafu's article is a representative work of the table tennis team's early study of Chairman Mao's writings.
    In the discussion, everyone first pointed out: In addition to attacking Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article as a typical example of "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism," the bourgeois "authorities" also viciously said: "Is it appropriate to say that table tennis was won because of studying Mao Zedong Thought? If you lose, does that mean you didn't study Mao Zedong Thought?" They even arbitrarily stipulated: "Don't apply Mao Zedong Thought to playing table tennis!" This is a self-confession that exposes their black hearts, which are frantically opposed to Mao Zedong Thought.
    The comrades of the table tennis team emphasized: We are dialectical materialists. We have never denied that technical strength is the basis; however, we have always opposed the mechanical materialist view that only emphasizes technical strength and does not see that spirit can produce a huge role. We believe that the victory or defeat of a game depends not only on technology and tactics, but also on mental state. Under certain conditions, the spirit plays a decisive role. Practice in competition has repeatedly proved that when we correctly understand and apply Mao Zedong Thought, we can greatly enhance our technical power and guarantee victory to the greatest extent. Conversely, when we violate Chairman Mao's teachings, the competition will fail. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article clearly shows our point of view and answers the slanders of the bourgeois "authorities." In his article, he deeply analyzed the fact that in the past, our team members often blindly believed in foreign strong players and looked at problems from a mechanical, idealist, and absolute point of view. In 1958, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the country, the whole team broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and studied Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War," which improved their ability to use dialectics and changed the previous situation of seeing more advantages in the other party and fewer advantages in themselves. This strengthened their confidence in climbing the world's peak and finally, in the 25th World Championships in 1959, they won the world championship in men's singles and five third places, showing the huge role of spirit transforming into matter. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu also vividly applied Chairman Mao's thoughts on strategy and tactics and the principles of "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" to the practice of table tennis, which is a very valuable creation.
    Everyone unanimously pointed out that Comrade Zhuang Jiafu, a Communist Party member from a working people's family, has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's writings. He was one of the best students in the team at that time, and his article was a representative work of our team's initial living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings. He clearly explained that the reason why we study Chairman Mao's writings is out of the urgent need to be a revolutionary. When we study it, we use it, and when we use it, it works. Revolutionaries like this article very much; certain bourgeois "authorities" regard it as a thorn in their side. What is the reason for this? Zhuang Zedong said incisively: "These guys want to strangle the masses' living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the bud and beat the newly emerging revolutionary forces to death with one blow. How vicious are their intentions!"
    Take the road of giving prominence to politics
    The burning desire to study Chairman Mao's writings in the hearts of the table tennis players is a flame that cannot be extinguished by any bourgeois "authorities" with high-ranking positions. Their movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought with the vast workers, peasants, and soldiers is a historical trend that cannot be stopped by any evil forces. The comrades of the table tennis team, following the Party's instructions, under the leadership and support of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and Comrade He Long, resolutely resisted the big stick of the bourgeois "authorities," and studied Chairman Mao's writings even more diligently, winning greater victories in the 26th World Championships.
    At that time, it was also a time when the country was suffering from natural disasters and modern revisionism was perfidiously withdrawing all experts and carrying out various sabotage activities. Like the workers of Daqing, the table tennis team, during this most difficult period, did not rely on any foreign experts, but relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely took its own path, relied on its own efforts, worked hard, overcame all difficulties, and climbed to the world's peak, winning the world championships in men's team, men's and women's singles, and four world runners-up. When the news of the victory came, the whole country rejoiced and people were encouraged. The cheers of "Long live the Communist Party of China" and "Long live Chairman Mao" resounded throughout the clouds.
    What the masses love is precisely what the bourgeois "authorities" hate. In the face of this indisputable brilliant fact, not only did they not shut their mouths, but they also made more absurd and vicious attacks on the table tennis team. They scolded: "This is labeling, it's superstition, like the Boxers chanting a spell and becoming invulnerable to swords and guns." They also spread rumors that a certain foreign athlete "wanted to turn the tables after losing in table tennis, so he tied a turban with a Buddha inside. Now we have replaced the Buddha with a Marx there, isn't it still superstition? It won't save you!" And they once again made arbitrary regulations: "Don't simply and rigidly say that some technical creations are the result of applying Mao Zedong Thought!"
    This is truly a slanderous attack. In the competition, the young players displayed the revolutionary "Little Tiger" style of being fearless of heaven and earth, fully embodying the heroic spirit of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are invincible and can climb any peak. People still remember vividly the scene of Xu Yinsheng hitting the Japanese team's main player Hoshino with twelve smashes in a row in the team final to achieve the final victory. Where did this soaring revolutionary drive come from? The table tennis players unanimously pointed out: "This is because we have Mao Zedong Thought, the infinitely powerful spiritual atomic bomb."
    During the training period for the 26th World Championships, the comrades of the table tennis team enthusiastically studied the newly published Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and used the revolutionary spirit of daring to win and being good at struggle, which runs through the entire book, as the guiding ideology for welcoming this competition. They overthrew all kinds of "ghosts" in their minds, overcame conservative and fearful emotions and thoughts of personal fame and gain, went into battle lightly armed, and were full of fighting spirit. The bourgeois "authorities" closed their eyes and didn't see, plugged their ears and didn't hear, and insisted on saying that Mao Zedong Thought was used as a label and was superstition. The comrades of the table tennis team said it well: "Mao Zedong Thought has taken root firmly in our hearts, and no one can pull it out. It is these bourgeois 'authorities' themselves who are attaching labels and pretending. They are opposing the red flag under the guise of the 'red flag'. They are afraid of their black hearts being recognized, so they steal Mao Zedong Thought to dress themselves up. Now that they have been exposed, they have completely exposed their true faces as fake Communists, fake Marxists, and fake revolutionaries."
    Regarding the fallacy of "Don't simply and rigidly say that some technical creations are the result of applying Mao Zedong Thought," Coach Fu Qifang refuted: "This shows that the bourgeois 'authorities' know nothing about revolutionary practice and have no common language with us at all." He cited the fact of creating the unique style of attacking the ball with "fast, accurate, ruthless, and variable" to point out that this is a product of studying Mao Zedong Thought, applying dialectics to table tennis technology, and fighting against metaphysics and idealism. Some people once proposed that China's table tennis technology should be "advanced and complex, and solved with one shot"; some foreign teams with more experience than us spent a lot of effort on rotation when training attacking players. This is because they failed to grasp the main contradiction of table tennis attacking technology and give it a scientific solution, which led to defeat in the competition. Through repeated practice, our table tennis team used the principles of dialectical materialism to scientifically analyze the special laws of table tennis technology, and realized that "fast, accurate, ruthless, and variable" are the four aspects needed to complete an offensive action, and fast is the leading aspect of the contradiction. Rotation and change must obey speed, and the first thing to do in table tennis is to be fast. "Fast, accurate, ruthless, and variable" is a scientific summary of the internal contradictions of Chinese athletes' fast-attack style. In the 26th World Championships, this Chinese-style style of play defeated the strong spin of the arc ball of Japanese players, which was called "unmatched in the world," and also defeated the defense of European players, which was called "copper wall and iron wall." Therefore, it was recognized as "the most vibrant style of play, bringing revolution to table tennis technology, showing a new direction, and promoting this championship to become a historical turning point in world table tennis."
    Comrade Xu Yinsheng said: "Chairman Mao's teachings have made us understand that without destruction there can be no construction, without obstruction there can be no flow, and that we must dare to criticize and struggle, and dare to carry out revolutionary innovation. If we, the proletarian sports team, do not dare to break the bourgeois system and run behind their butts, we will never stand up and never move forward. We must open up our own path and lead to the world's peak. Now we can clearly see that the path we have taken for more than ten years is a path that highlights proletarian politics and highlights Mao Zedong Thought. This path is completely opposed to the bourgeois path of champion-ism, technology-ism, and money-ism. We use politics to command business, and in technology, we adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and taking ourselves as the mainstay. What foreigners have, we must have; what foreigners don't have, we must also have." Because of this, they can establish the new of socialism and establish the difference of the proletariat from thought to ball skills. The creation and application of the "fast, accurate, ruthless, and variable" style of play is a clear example of ideological revolution driving technological revolution. Without the thought of daring to break through and surpass, it would be impossible to carry out style innovation, and without the spirit of daring to fight and dare to struggle, this style could not be implemented, and the ball would not be played fast or ruthlessly, and the accuracy and spin changes would be greatly reduced.
    Everyone unanimously stated: "Mao Zedong Thought is the soul that commands our thoughts and skills. Every progress in our thinking and skills is the result of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The bourgeois 'authorities' attempt to use the stick of 'simplification' to prevent us from applying Mao Zedong Thought to the technical field is truly wishful thinking."
    Never Forget Class Struggle
    The leader of the table tennis team recalled that at the closing ceremony of the 26th World Championships held at the Beijing Workers' Stadium, as soon as the applause ended and the people had not yet dispersed, Comrade He Long convened a meeting of the responsible comrades of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and the table tennis team in the rest room of the stadium, and solemnly raised the task of continuing to leap forward in the future. He pointed out that the first thing to do is to grasp the fundamental issue of improving the athletes' class consciousness, using Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism, and we must prevent self-satisfaction. Not only must athletes play well, but more importantly, they must understand that playing is doing revolution, and that playing is mainly a matter of politics, transforming the subjective world in the process of transforming the objective world, promoting ideological revolutionization, and gradually cultivating them to become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    As the table tennis team achieved greater and greater victories in the 25th and 26th World Championships, on the one hand, the Party and the people gave high honors and cordial care and education; on the other hand, some bourgeois elements also came out to support them, trying every means to corrupt them and compete with us for the younger generation. Some counter-revolutionary family members used the method of pulling them out to entangle a famous player on the table tennis team in a love affair. The reflection of class struggle within the team was also very intense.
    In September 1962, at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao issued the call not to forget class struggle, which greatly enhanced the class struggle concept of the table tennis team. They firmly grasped the key of class struggle and regarded strengthening the ideological transformation of the team as the fundamental link in preparing for the 27th World Championships. On the one hand, they organized athletes to go to the countryside for labor, to join the army as soldiers, to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, to study the experience of the People's Liberation Army in adhering to the Four Firsts, and to carry forward the excellent revolutionary tradition of hard struggle; on the other hand, they emphasized that in training, competition, and daily life, they should give prominence to politics everywhere and at all times, use politics to command business, regard the training ground and the competition ground as the battlefield for promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism, and regard every training and competition as a practical exercise to fire on the "self" word, and turn every competition summary meeting into a classroom for living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and for talking about dialectics. In this way, they continuously improved the proletarian class consciousness and political and ideological level of the table tennis players, and effectively resisted the erosion of bourgeois ideology. A group of new-type proletarian athletes grew up. Zhuang Zedong, Xu Yinsheng, Li Furong, Zhou Lansun and other outstanding players joined the Party one after another, became five-good athletes, and the team's combat effectiveness was greatly strengthened.
    But at the same time, a very small number of athletes who took the bourgeois road of being only expert but not red also appeared in the team. Han Yuzhen was a prominent example. She was the third generation of athletes after Sun Meiying and Qiu Zhonghui, and was originally trained as the main player to prepare for the 27th Championships. For a time, her skills were second to none in the women's team, but she had serious individualism, and not only could she not be strong in major competitions, but she also sabotaged the collective victory. Therefore, she was resolutely not selected to go to the 27th World Championships. Later, Han Yuzhen expressed some remorse, and the Party's education and training of young people was benevolent and righteous, and gave her another opportunity to exercise, allowing her to participate in training and some international competitions. She failed the test and repeatedly showed the bad qualities of harming others for her own benefit, proving that she adhered to the decadent bourgeois world outlook, repeatedly refused to be taught, and was an extreme individualist. The table tennis team decided to clean her out.
    The struggle against Han Yuzhen is a reflection of the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in the table tennis team. It once again shows that the table tennis team does not live in a vacuum, and playing table tennis, like other fields, is full of sharp and complex class struggles. This struggle is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very intense.
    But at this time, the bourgeois "authority" gentlemen once again made a lot of noise. They said: "Is there so much individualism in playing table tennis?" "Don't attribute wins and losses to individualism!" and so on. This is completely a revisionist argument that denies class struggle. Class struggle is the fundamental viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, and individualism is the core of bourgeois ideology. Not allowing opposition to individualism means not allowing the class struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism, not allowing touching the soul of the bourgeoisie, and preserving the foundation for them to engage in capitalist restoration. The comrades of the table tennis team did not fall for the trick of the bourgeois "authorities." They realized that whether to tolerate or resolutely struggle against Han Yuzhen's bourgeois ideological behavior, and whether to select athletes based on technology first or adhere to politics first, is a matter of whether to be revolutionary or not. With the spirit of thorough revolution, they resolutely carried out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism, boldly exposed contradictions, solved contradictions, and did not hesitate even if it affected the victory or defeat of the competition. Here, whether politics is first or winning the ball is first, whether winning the ball obeys politics and serves politics, or politics obeys winning the ball and serves winning the ball, the table tennis team made an unambiguous answer to this fundamental question. They held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, adhered to the proletarian line of business obeying politics and serving politics, and did not care about short-term gains or losses. The women's team temporarily lost in the 27th because of the lack of successors. The veterans Sun Meiying and the novices Lin Huiqing, Li Henan, etc. all made their best efforts, played out their style, and played out their level. People can clearly see that it was precisely because of adhering to the correct direction of the proletariat and abandoning people like Han Yuzhen who were only expert but not red that the foundation for the women's team's "turning over" in the 28th was laid. The overall victory of the men's team in the 27th was also the result of adhering to the use of Mao Zedong Thought to transform the team and taking the road of being both red and expert.
    Comrades angrily pointed out: The so-called "Don't attribute wins and losses to individualism" is also a complete fabrication and slander. Our team has always followed Comrade He Long's instructions to "play out the style, play out the level," and "win the ball to win people, lose the ball not to lose people," and emphasizes making a comprehensive and realistic analysis of the victory or defeat of the competition, opposing the metaphysical view of "everything is good when you win, and everything is bad when you lose," and opposing the purely technical viewpoint of the bourgeoisie that being technically good means being ideologically good. It encourages athletes to make their best efforts in the competition to strive for the overall victory of politics, ideology, and technology, and never allows bad styles to appear in the competition, but allows athletes to fail in circumstances beyond their control. As long as the direction is correct and the style is good, failure to win due to technical strength will not only not be criticized, but will also be praised.
    The comrades of the table tennis team said: "The bourgeois 'authorities' vainly attempt to paralyze our vigilance against class struggle and guide us to take the evil path of deviating from proletarian politics. This is a futile attempt. Their various tricks just reflect the complexity and intensity of class struggle. These negative teachers have made us understand this truth even more: Never forget class struggle."
    Chairman Mao's Instruction Gave Us the Strength of Thousands of Troops and Horses
    In the 28th World Table Tennis Championships in 1965, China's table tennis team achieved unprecedented victory. The people of the whole country unanimously pointed out: This victory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Even some foreigners saw the spiritual strength of the Chinese athletes. They said: "Chinese people always fight back no matter what setbacks they encounter. We have seen the epitome of our times in this competition venue." But those bourgeois "authorities" who were stubbornly adamant still resolutely opposed linking the victory of the table tennis team with Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as they saw the article summarizing the 28th World Championships, they first tampered with the title of the article (as mentioned earlier); then they deleted almost all the quotations of Chairman Mao in the article. They especially insisted on deleting the following sentences of Chairman Mao: "Those who direct war cannot overstep the limits imposed by the objective conditions for its exercise, yet they can and must strive for victory within the limits of the objective conditions." (These sentences were finally retained with the support of the magazine editorial department.)
    The comrades of the table tennis team pointed out: "Chairman Mao's words correctly explain the dialectical relationship between the subjective and the objective, and emphasize the role of subjective initiative. For us, this subjective initiative comes precisely from Mao Zedong Thought. The bourgeois 'authorities' do not allow us to talk about subjective initiative, and their purpose is precisely to oppose Mao Zedong Thought. The intentions of these gentlemen are really cunning and vicious! This article summarizing the experience of table tennis competition, its arguments, its title, and its citation of Chairman Mao's instructions are all fully justified."
    During the training period for the 28th World Championships, the table tennis team's movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought entered a new stage. The more they studied, the more they loved to study, and the more they solved problems. They further studied the experience of the People's Liberation Army and implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "Study with problems in mind, study and apply it in a living way, combine study and application, study what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results." They made it a habit to repeatedly study the basic viewpoints, highlight the application, and consciously use them to transform their thinking and guide their playing. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they analyzed the situation after the 27th Championships. They realized that if the men's team wanted to maintain its honor, it must not be arrogant after winning and must continue the revolution; if the women's team wanted to "turn over" in the 28th, it must not be discouraged after losing and must work harder. But the young female players were not ambitious enough and still had some personal distractions. What to do? They turned to Chairman Mao's writings for advice with these problems. The men's team also came to help. In particular, Comrade Xu Yinsheng's speech vividly and thoroughly analyzed the problems of the women's team and proposed that athletes must establish a revolutionary world outlook, put the honor of the motherland first, practice and compete with strong class feelings and a sense of "enemy situation," and be good at treating the problems in training and competition in a one-divided-into-two manner. Comrade Xu Yinsheng's speech was a high-level summary of the table tennis team's years of experience in the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. It was also a resounding slap in the face to those bourgeois "authorities" who did not allow Mao Zedong Thought to be used in playing table tennis.
    Comrade He Long immediately forwarded this speech to all sports teams in the country to study, pointing out that Comrade Xu Yinsheng had studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, raised extremely important issues, and had universal significance.
    On January 12, 1965, Chairman Mao approved this speech, pointing out that the full text of the speech was full of dialectical materialism and opposed idealism and any kind of metaphysics everywhere. For many years, he had not seen such a good work. He was talking about playing ball. What we should learn from him is theory, politics, economics, culture, and military affairs. If we do not learn from the young players, we will be finished. These young players have challenged us, a large group of veterans. Shouldn't we learn something from them?
    Chairman Mao's instructions greatly dispelled the sense of mystery of "philosophy" among the broad masses and opened a new page in the history of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering philosophy.
    Chairman Mao's instructions have become the strength of thousands of troops and horses to encourage the Chinese table tennis team to advance victoriously. In preparing for the 28th battle, they put the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought first and used revolutionary dialectics in practice. They said: "This is a weapon that is much more important than a racket." "With this ideological weapon, we can command the racket in our hands." The women's team felt particularly close to Chairman Mao's instructions. They received tremendous spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's instructions, brightened their eyes, and broadened their minds. Zheng Minzhi, who was originally more capricious, said: "For the benefit of the vast majority of people in the world, I will change!" She really changed. Li Henan, Lin Huiqing, Liang Lizhen, and Zheng Minzhi, like her, also used the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions to examine and correct their shortcomings and mistakes. They went to win the world championship with great ambition.
    When the female players stepped onto the podium for the world championship, Lin Huiqing said from the bottom of her heart: "This 'turning over' battle relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and one-divided-into-two is really great."
    How could they be strong at critical moments? Zhou Lansun said: "In the 26th competition, when I was playing a world strong player, when I was about to win, I remembered that a reporter had asked me to write an article. My thoughts wandered and I lost the ball with a crash. In the past few years, I have worked hard to study Chairman Mao's writings, overcome personal distractions, and finally achieved a high degree of concentration during the competition, which is why I won this time." Indeed, from the difference of one thought in the past to the high degree of concentration now, Zhou Lansun spent four years in total. His words solved the mystery of why Zhou Lansun, who had long had the strength in the 26th, only came out in the 28th. The players deeply realized the importance of ideological transformation. They said: "The trace of distracting thoughts that appears in the competition for a few seconds has thousands of connections behind it! Only by completely overcoming individualism can we achieve a high degree of concentration and serve the people wholeheartedly."
    After winning great honor for the motherland, they continued to use Mao Zedong Thought, this incomparably sharp weapon, to aim at their own shortcomings and errors and mercilessly fire. They said: "Forgiveness of shortcomings is a mistake to the revolution." When people saw Zhuang Zedong's article full of self-criticism in the newspaper, and when they heard that the table tennis team's summary meeting of the 28th was more thrilling than the 28th competition, they couldn't help but ask: "You got the world championship and you still examine yourself so severely?" The table tennis players answered one after another: "Chairman Mao taught us that the Long March is only the first step, and it takes a lot of effort to consolidate victory. If we want to maintain the world championship, our technology must be improved to a higher level, and our ideology must be improved to a higher level first." "The championship can reach the top, but serving the people will not reach the top. We must start from zero and continue the revolution!"
    Only the proletarian world champions who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought can have this revolutionary spirit of "piercing the blue sky and the sword is not broken," and can speak such lively revolutionary language.
    All this shows that the table tennis team is constantly revolutionizing and advancing victoriously under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. In the article summarizing the experience of this competition, it is natural to use such a title and such a citation. The various alterations of the bourgeois "authority" gentlemen are really "an ant trying to shake a big tree, ridiculous and overestimating their own strength," and in the end, only they themselves will be crushed.
    Grasp From the Root, Start From Zero
    "Grasp from the root, start from zero" is an important experience of the Chinese table tennis team in using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective and objective worlds, and it is also a fighting slogan full of the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This slogan shows that the comrades of the table tennis team insist on treating the study of Chairman Mao's writings as the foundation of all work, starting from the fundamental issue of transforming the world outlook, cherishing the motherland, looking at the world, and attributing all achievements to the Party and the people, not carrying any burdens themselves, starting from zero, and continuing the revolution. After the 28th competition, the Chinese table tennis team further launched a new upsurge in the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and more consciously used Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all actions, and worked hard on the word "use." This visit to Japan, Cambodia, and Syria, whether on the journey or in the hotel, seized all the time to study Chairman Mao's writings, and never interrupted even during the most tense days of the competition. During the visit, just as China's cultural revolution entered its climax, they regarded reading Chairman Mao's books as the first need of the revolution, never forgetting class struggle, and always strictly demanding themselves with the spirit of thorough revolution.
    The success of the foreign visit fully demonstrated the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought and once again gave the bourgeois "authorities" a powerful response.
    Bearing in mind Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world, Zhuang Zedong, Lin Huiqing, etc., during their visit to Cambodia, despite the hot weather and poor physical condition, in order to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples and meet the audience's requirements for watching the competition, they did not spare their own energy. Sometimes the competition was held on an open-air venue after the rain. The wind was strong and the ground was wet. They picked up the balls covered with mud time and time again and tried their best to play the ball well. The noble qualities of these proletarian athletes were highly praised by the Cambodian people.
    The team that visited Japan was a young team and also a politically strong team. This visit to Japan was a contest of strength before the 29th World Championships. For every athlete, it was a severe test. To pass this test, it first depends on the guarantee of political ideology. Over the years, a trend has been formed in the table tennis team. No matter how fierce the competition is, athletes dare to expose ideological problems, and leaders and comrades are brave in helping, boldly contact the essence of the problem, are not afraid of touching the depths of the soul, and dare to "see red with a bayonet."
    Li Henan's three victories over world champion Fukatsu Hisako and the whole team's final battle in Nagoya profoundly reflected this revolutionary spirit.
    Li Henan had lost to Fukatsu before. When she met Fukatsu in the first game this time, she still had some superstitions. She boldly exposed this idea. Coach Rong Guotuan said to her: "To win Fukatsu, you must get rid of the word 'fear,' establish the word 'dare,' and defeat the word 'self.'" She felt that she had the problem of judging heroes by victory or defeat, and was afraid that others would look down on her if she lost. With this problem, she read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and was determined to learn the noble character of Comrade Bethune without any selfishness, put down her burden, and fought hard to win. In the second and third encounters with Fukatsu, she overcame the "difficult" and "preserve" words in her thinking and finally won three world championships.
    In the final battle of the visit to Japan in Nagoya, both sides sent out their strongest lineups. The Chinese team did a lot of ideological work before the game, and the atmosphere was very strong on the spot. The men's and women's team competitions won all the games. That night, a Japanese table tennis expert said to Zhou Lansun at the reception: "Looking at your determination in today's competition, I knew you would win, because you overwhelmed us spiritually." This was not only felt by him alone. When the Japanese people were discussing "Why is Chinese table tennis progressing so fast and so powerfully?" many newspapers and magazines commented that "The Chinese team equipped with Mao Zedong Thought weapons is indeed different." The famous Japanese coach Kitaro Hasegawa also said: "Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated into the hearts of every member of the Chinese table tennis team. This is reflected in every game. The Chinese team that visited Japan this time emphasized studying Mao Zedong Thought more than ever before and put forward strict and considerate requirements for the spiritual aspects of athletes. Through the competition, I deeply realized the results achieved by the Chinese players in studying Mao Zedong Thought."
    The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese table tennis team in the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought have been praised by foreign public opinion, but those bourgeois "authorities" have stubbornly attacked them. Does this not expose the counter-revolutionary true colors of the "scholar authorities"!
    The comrades of the table tennis team also angrily pointed out: "Birds of a feather flock together, and people are divided into groups. A major responsible person of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee also reprimanded the athletes with a master-like attitude: 'What are you doing studying this (referring to Chairman Mao's writings)? It's better to go swimming and increase your appetite.' Among the large number of poisonous arrows sent out by the Deng Tuo counter-revolutionary gang, they also attacked our table tennis team again and again, and pointed the spearhead of the struggle at Mao Zedong Thought. For example, in the black words of 'The Newborn Calf Is Not Afraid of the Tiger' in 'Yanshan Night Talk,' they attacked the new forces of our team with ulterior motives, saying that they are 'newborn calves, actually not as good as tigers, but just not afraid, maybe they don't know how to be afraid.' This is to insult us for not being afraid of strong opponents, which is blind, the courage of a young child, and the spiritual victory of Ah Q. And they sang the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. This completely proves that they are jackals of the same lair. Starting from the reactionary instincts of the exploiting class, they always try every means to slander Mao Zedong Thought and extremely hate the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings. The truth cannot be overthrown by scolding, and the truth is developed in struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: 'We must support whatever the enemy opposes, and we must oppose whatever the enemy supports.' The more the enemy scolds Mao Zedong Thought, the more we love it."
    In the discussion, everyone unanimously and repeatedly emphasized that "Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, the powerful weapon for the Chinese people to be invincible, and the powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to be invincible. Chairman Mao's words are of the highest level, the highest

    在毛泽东思想指引下前进
    ——中国乒乓球队驳资产阶级“权威”
    读者们，这篇通讯使用这个题目，是为了揭穿某些所谓“权威”反对毛泽东思想的一个大阴谋。一九六五年第二十八届世界乒乓球锦标赛后，一篇总结我国乒乓球队经验的文章，题目就是现在这一个。这个题目真实地表明了中国乒乓球队迅速成长的根本原因。但掌握审稿大权的中央宣传部的一位副部长，却蛮横地把它改为另一个根本不提毛泽东思想的题目。现在，在社会主义文化大革命的战鼓声中，在这些所谓“权威”已经失去他们的控制能力，被打得落花流水的时候，我们重新使用《在毛泽东思想指引下前进》这个题目。
    最近我们分别访问了从日本、柬埔寨、叙利亚归来的中国乒乓球队的健儿们。他们在归途中，从报上看到重新发表的庄家富同志的文章，曾被某些反动的资产阶级“权威”诬蔑为“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的典型，个个义愤填膺。当谈论到某些资产阶级“权威”不准用《在毛泽东思想指引下前进》这个题目的事实真相时，他们更是抑制不住心中的怒火，非常愤慨地说：“在毛主席批示徐寅生讲话以后，在我队取得二十八届比赛的重大胜利之后，资产阶级‘权威’们竟然还敢明目张胆地禁止我们用毛泽东思想，真是猖狂到了极点！”他们说：“这几年，资产阶级‘权威’老爷们对乒乓球队的攻击还不止这一些，我们胜利一次，他们攻击一次，我们在党的领导下把毛泽东思想的红旗举得越高，他们对我们的攻击也就越厉害。显然，他们的矛头所指，不是我们一个小小的球队，而是伟大的毛泽东思想。这是绝不能允许的。当前，在我国已经兴起文化大革命的高潮，敲响了这些资产阶级‘权威’的丧钟，我们横扫这些牛鬼蛇神的时代已经到来了。”
    乒乓球队员们从国外返京后，不顾旅途的劳累，连日来进行座谈，系统地回顾了中国乒乓球队活学活用毛泽东思想取得不断进步的光辉历程，以铁一般的事实给资产阶级“权威”们以猛烈的回击。
    庄家富的文章是乒乓球队早期学习毛主席著作的代表作
    在座谈中，大家首先提出：资产阶级“权威”们除了攻击庄家富同志的文章是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”的典型以外，还恶毒地说：“乒乓球打胜了是因为学了毛泽东思想，这妥当吗？打败了，难道就是没有学毛泽东思想？”甚至蛮横地规定：“不要把毛泽东思想用到打乒乓球上去！”这真是不打自招地暴露了他们疯狂反对毛泽东思想的黑心肠。
    乒乓球队的同志们强调说：我们是辩证唯物主义者。从来没有否认技术实力作基础；但是也一向反对只强调技术实力，而看不到精神可以产生巨大作用的机械唯物观点。我们认为，比赛的胜负不仅取决于技术、战术，更取决于精神状态，在一定条件下，精神起决定性作用。比赛的实践反复证明，当我们正确领会运用毛泽东思想时，就可以大大增强技术威力，最大限度地保证胜利。反之，当我们违背毛主席的教导时，比赛就会遭到失败。庄家富同志的文章就明确地表明了我们这一观点，回答了资产阶级“权威”们的诬蔑。他在文章中深刻地分析了过去我队队员往往迷信外国强手，以机械、唯心、绝对的观点看问题。一九五八年全队在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，破除迷信，解放思想，学习毛主席《中国革命战争的战略问题》后，提高了运用辩证法的能力，改变了过去看对方优点多、看自己优点少的情况，增强了攀登世界高峰的信心，终于在一九五九年第二十五届世界锦标赛中，取得了男子单打世界冠军和五项第三名，显示了精神变物质的巨大作用。庄家富同志还把毛主席关于战略战术的思想和《矛盾论》《实践论》的原理生动地运用到乒乓球运动的实践上，这是一个很可贵的创造。
    大家一致指出，出身劳动人民家庭的共产党员庄家富同志，对毛主席著作有着深厚的阶级感情，他是当时全队学得最好的一个，他的文章是我队初期活学活用毛主席著作的代表作。他清楚地说明了，我们之所以学毛主席著作，是出于作一个革命者的迫切需要，学了就用，用了就灵。这篇文章，革命者看了都很喜欢；某些资产阶级“权威”则视为眼中钉。这是什么原因呢？庄则栋一针见血地说：“这些家伙是想把广大群众活学活用毛泽东思想扼杀在萌芽状态，在新生的革命力量刚一露头的时候就一棍子打死。他们的用心多么恶毒！”
    走突出政治的道路
    燃烧在乒乓球队队员心中学习毛主席著作的热烈愿望，是任何官大职高的资产阶级“权威”所扑不灭的火焰，他们和广大工农兵一道活学活用毛泽东思想的运动，是任何恶势力所阻挡不了的历史潮流。乒乓球队的同志们遵循党的指示，在国家体委、贺龙同志的领导和支持下，坚决顶住了资产阶级“权威”的大棒，更加奋发努力地学习毛主席著作，在第二十六届世界锦标赛上获得了更大的胜利。
    那时，也正是国家遭受自然灾害，现代修正主义背信弃义地撤退全部专家、进行各种破坏的时候。乒乓球队和大庆工人一样，在这个最困难的时期，不依靠任何外国专家，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，坚决走自己的路，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，排除万难，冲上了世界高峰，一举取得了男子团体、男女单打三项世界冠军和四项世界亚军。胜利消息传来，举国欢腾，人心振奋，“中国共产党万岁”“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    群众爱的，正是资产阶级“权威”们所恨的。他们在这个无可争辩的光辉事实面前，不仅不闭上他们的嘴，反而对乒乓球队进行了更为荒谬、更为恶毒的攻击。他们破口大骂：“这是贴标签，是迷信，象义和团念个咒就刀枪不入。”还造谣说某外国运动员“打乒乓球输了想翻回来，就扎了块头巾，里面包个菩萨。现在我们把菩萨换了一个马克思在那里，还不是迷信吗？它不会救你的！”他们并且再一次横蛮地做出规定：“不要把某些技术的创造，简单生硬地说成是应用毛泽东思想的结果！”
    这真是血口喷人。小将们在比赛中打出了天不怕、地不怕的革命“小老虎”风格，充分体现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民无坚不可摧、无高不可攀的英雄气概。徐寅生在这届团体决赛中，对日本队主力星野连打十二大板取得最后胜利的情景，人们至今记忆犹新。这股冲天的革命干劲是哪里来的呢？乒乓球选手一致指出：“这是因为我们有毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的精神原子弹。”
    在第二十六届世界比赛集训期间，乒乓球队的同志们热烈地学习了刚出版不久的《毛泽东选集》第四卷，以贯串全书的敢于胜利、善于斗争的革命精神，作为迎接这届比赛的指导思想。打倒了思想上形形色色的“鬼”，克服保守畏难情绪和个人名利思想，轻装上阵，斗志昂扬。资产阶级“权威”们闭眼不看，充耳不闻，硬说是把毛泽东思想当标签贴，是迷信。乒乓球队的同志们说得好：“毛泽东思想在我们心里已经牢牢地扎下了根，谁也拔不掉。贴标签装门面的倒恰恰是这批资产阶级‘权威’们自己。他们打着‘红旗’反红旗，怕黑心被识破，就盗用毛泽东思想打扮自己。现在戳穿了，就彻底暴露了他们假共产党、假马克思主义、假革命的真面目。”
    对于所谓“不要把某些技术的创造，简单生硬地说成是应用毛泽东思想的结果”的谬论，傅其芳教练驳斥说：“这说明资产阶级‘权威’们对革命实践一窍不通，与我们根本没有共同语言。”他列举创造“快准狠变”的攻球独特风格的事实指出，这是学习毛泽东思想，把辩证法运用到乒乓球技术上，与形而上学、唯心论斗争的一个产物。有的人曾提出，我国乒乓球技术要“高级复杂，一板解决”；一些经验比我们丰富的外国队，训练攻球运动员时，在旋转上花了很大功夫。这都是没有抓住乒乓球攻球技术的主要矛盾，给以科学的解决，以致在比赛中败北。我国乒乓球队通过反复的实践，运用辩证唯物主义的原理，科学地分析了乒乓球技术的特殊规律，认识到“快准狠变”是完成进攻行动所需要的四个侧面，快是矛盾的主导方面，旋转变化要服从快，打乒乓球首先要快。“快准狠变”，是对我国运动员快攻打法内在矛盾的科学概括。在二十六届世界比赛中，这种中国式的打法，击破了日本选手号称“天下无敌”的弧圈球的强烈旋转，也击破了欧洲选手号称“铜墙铁壁”的防守。因而被公认为“是最富有生命力的打法，给乒乓球技术带来了革命，显示了新的方向，促使本届锦标赛成为世界乒乓球运动的历史转折点”。
    徐寅生同志说：“毛主席的教导，使我们懂得了不破不立，不塞不流，要敢于批判斗争，敢于革命创新。我们无产阶级运动队如果不敢破资产阶级的一套，跟在他们屁股后面跑，是永远站不起来，永远走不到前面的。必须开辟自己的道路，通向世界高峰。现在可以清楚地看出，十几年来，我们所走的路，就是一条突出无产阶级政治的道路，突出毛泽东思想的道路。这条道路与资产阶级锦标挂帅、技术挂帅、钞票挂帅的道路是完全对立的。我们是以政治统帅业务，在技术上，坚持百花齐放，以我为主的方针。外国有的，我们要有；外国没有的，我们也要有。”正因为如此，他们从思想到球艺，能够标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。“快准狠变”这套打法的创造和运用，正是思想革命带动技术革命的一个鲜明例子。没有敢闯敢超的思想，就不可能进行风格独创，而没有敢打敢拼的精神，这套风格也贯彻不了，球就打不快、打不狠，准确和旋转变化也会威力大减。
    大家一致表示：“毛泽东思想是统帅我们思想、技术的灵魂。我们思想上、技术上的每一个进步，都是学习运用毛泽东思想的结果。资产阶级‘权威’们企图用‘简单化’的棍子，阻拦我们把毛泽东思想用到技术领域中去，真是痴心妄想。”
    千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    乒乓球队领队回忆道，在北京工人体育馆举行的第二十六届世界锦标赛的闭幕式刚结束，掌声未落人未散，贺龙同志就在体育馆的休息室里，召集国家体委和乒乓球队的负责同志开会，严肃地提出了今后继续跃进的任务。他指出，首先要抓好提高运动员阶级觉悟这个根本问题，用毛泽东思想挂帅，兴无灭资，一定要防止翘尾巴。不仅要使运动员打好球，更重要的是要使他们懂得打球是干革命，打球主要是打政治的道理，在改造客观世界中改造主观世界，促进思想革命化，逐步培养他们成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    随着乒乓球队在第二十五届、二十六届世界比赛连续获得越来越大的胜利，一方面，党和人民给予了很高的荣誉和亲切的关怀教育；另一方面，一些资产阶级分子也出来捧场，千方百计地进行腐蚀，与我们争夺年青一代。有的反革命家属用拉出去的办法，纠缠乒乓球队的一位著名选手搞恋爱。队内阶级斗争的反映也很激烈。
    一九六二年九月，在党的八届十中全会上毛主席发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的号召，更大大提高了乒乓球队的阶级斗争观念。他们紧紧抓住阶级斗争的纲，把加强队伍的思想改造，作为参加二十七届世界比赛准备工作的根本环节。一方面组织运动员下乡劳动，下连当兵，与工农兵结合，向工农兵学习，大学解放军坚持四个第一，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良革命传统的经验；一方面强调在集训、比赛和日常生活中，处处时时突出政治，以政治统帅业务，把训练场、比赛场当作兴无灭资的战场，把平日的每一次训练、比赛，当作向“我”字开火的实战锻炼，把每一次比赛总结会变成活学活用毛泽东思想，大讲辩证法的课堂。这样，不断提高了乒乓球队员的无产阶级的阶级觉悟和政治思想水平，有力地抵制了资产阶级思想的侵蚀。一批无产阶级新型运动员成长起来了。庄则栋、徐寅生、李富荣、周兰荪等优秀选手先后入了党，成为五好运动员，队伍的战斗力大大加强了。
    但同时，队伍里也出现了极少数走资产阶级只专不红的道路的运动员。韩玉珍就是一个突出的典型。她是继孙梅英、丘钟惠之后的第三代运动员，本来是作为准备参加第二十七届比赛的主力队员来培养的。有个时期她的技术在女队首屈一指，但她有严重的个人主义，在重大比赛中不仅自己不能过硬，还破坏集体的胜利。因此，二十七届世界比赛就坚决没有选她去。后来，韩玉珍表示有所悔悟，党对青年的教育培养是仁至义尽的，又给了她锻炼的机会，让她参加了集训和一些国际比赛。她没有经得起考验，一再表现了损人利己的恶劣品质，证明她坚持腐朽的资产阶级世界观，屡教不改，是一个极端的个人主义者。乒乓球队决定把她清洗出去。
    对韩玉珍的斗争是阶级斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争在乒乓球队的一个反映。它又一次说明了乒乓球队不是生活在真空里，打乒乓球也同其他领域一样充满了尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，这个斗争是长期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。
    但这时，资产阶级“权威”老爷们又大放厥词了。他们说：“打乒乓球也有那么多个人主义吗？”“不要把输赢都归结到个人主义！”等等。这完全是否认阶级斗争的修正主义论调。阶级斗争是毛泽东思想的根本观点，而个人主义是资产阶级思想的核心，不许反对个人主义，就是不许进行兴无灭资的阶级斗争，就是不许触动资产阶级的灵魂，就是保存他们搞资本主义复辟的基础。乒乓球队的同志没有上资产阶级“权威”们的当，他们认识到，对韩玉珍这种资产阶级思想行为，是姑息迁就，还是坚决斗争；选拔运动员是技术挂帅，还是坚持政治挂帅，这是革命不革命的问题。他们以彻底革命的精神，坚决开展兴无灭资的斗争，大胆揭露矛盾，解决矛盾，即使影响比赛的胜败也在所不惜。在这里，是政治第一还是赢球第一，是赢球服从政治，为政治服务，还是政治服从赢球，为赢球服务，对这个根本问题，乒乓球队作出了毫不含糊的回答。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持了业务服从政治，为政治服务的无产阶级路线，不计一日之长短。女队由于队伍青黄不接，在二十七届暂时失利了。老将孙梅英和新手林慧卿、李赫男等都尽了最大努力，打出了风格，打出了水平。人们可以清楚地看出，正是由于坚持了无产阶级的正确方向，摒弃了韩玉珍这类只专不红的人，才打下了二十八届女队“翻身”的基础。男队在二十七届获得的全面胜利，也正是坚持用毛泽东思想改造队伍，走又红又专道路的结果。
    同志们愤怒指出：所谓“不要把输赢都归结到个人主义”，也是彻头彻尾的捏造和污蔑。我队一向遵循贺龙同志“打出风格，打出水平”“赢球要赢人，输球不输人”的指示，强调对比赛胜败作出全面的、实事求是的分析，反对“赢了一切都好，输了一切不好”的形而上学观点，反对单纯以胜败论英雄，技术好就是思想好的资产阶级单纯技术观点。鼓励运动员在比赛中尽最大努力去争取政治思想技术的全面胜利，决不允许比赛中出现不良作风，却允许运动员在力所不及的情况下失败。只要方向正确风格好，由于技术实力未能取胜，不仅不受批评，还要受到表扬。
    乒乓球队的同志们说：“资产阶级‘权威’们妄想麻痹我们对阶级斗争的警惕性，引导我们走上脱离无产阶级政治的邪路，这是枉费心机的。他们的种种花招，恰好反映了阶级斗争的复杂和剧烈。这些反面教员更促使我们懂得这样一个真理：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”
    毛主席的批示给了我们千军万马的力量
    一九六五年第二十八届世界乒乓球比赛中，我国乒乓球队取得了空前的胜利。全国人民一致指出：这个胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。就是一些外国人，也看到了中国运动员的精神力量。他们说：“中国人无论遇到什么挫折，总是会打出来的。在这个比赛场里看到了我们时代的缩影。”但那些顽固到底的资产阶级“权威”们，仍然坚决反对把乒乓球队的胜利与毛泽东思想联系起来。一见总结二十八届世界比赛的文章，他们首先就篡改了文章的题目（前面已经谈到）；然后又把文中凡是引证毛主席的话几乎都删掉了。特别坚持要删掉下面几句毛主席的话：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。”（这几句话最后在杂志编辑部的支持下，才被保留下来。）
    乒乓球队的同志们指出：“毛主席这段话，极其正确地阐明了主观和客观的辩证关系，强调了主观能动性的作用。对于我们说来，这种主观能动性恰恰来源于毛泽东思想。资产阶级‘权威’们不许讲主观能动性，其目的也正是反对毛泽东思想。这些老爷们的居心，真是狡猾狠毒得很呵！这篇总结乒乓球比赛经验的文章，它的论点，它的标题和对毛主席的指示的引证，都有充分的根据。”
    二十八届世界比赛集训期间，乒乓球队活学活用毛主席著作的运动进入了一个新的阶段。他们越学越爱学，越用越解决问题。他们进一步学习了解放军的经验，贯彻了林彪同志的指示：“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。”做到基本观点反复学，突出用，形成了自觉地用来改造思想，指导打球的风气。他们在毛泽东思想指导下，分析了二十七届比赛后的形势。认识到，男队要保持荣誉，必须胜而不骄，不断革命；女队要在二十八届“翻身”，必须败而不馁，加倍努力。而年轻女队员心还不够雄，志还不够大，还有一些个人杂念。怎么办？她们带着这些问题向毛主席著作请教。男队也来帮忙。特别是徐寅生同志的讲话，生动而透彻地分析了女队的问题，提出了运动员必须树立革命的世界观，把祖国荣誉放在第一位，带着强烈的阶级感情和“敌情”观念去练球赛球，要善于一分为二地对待训练和比赛中的问题。徐寅生同志的讲话，是对乒乓球队多年活学活用毛泽东思想的经验的高度概括。也是对那些不准把毛泽东思想用到打乒乓球上的资产阶级“权威”们，打了一个响亮的耳光。
    贺龙同志立即把这篇讲话批转给全国运动队伍学习，指出徐寅生同志活学活用了毛泽东思想，提出了极为重要的问题，有普遍意义。
    一九六五年一月十二日，毛主席批示了这篇讲话，指出，讲话全文充满了辩证唯物论，处处反对唯心主义和任何一种形而上学。多年以来，没有看到这样好的作品，他讲的是打球。我们要从他那里学习的是理论、政治、经济、文化、军事。如果我们不向小将们学习，我们就要完蛋了。这是小将们向我们这一大批老将挑战了，难道我们不应该向他们学习一点什么东西吗？
    毛主席的批示，大大破除了广大群众对“哲学”的神秘感，揭开了工农兵群众掌握哲学的历史新页。
    毛主席的批示更成为鼓舞中国乒乓球队胜利前进的千军万马的力量。他们在准备二十八届战斗中，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，在实践中大学大用革命辩证法。他们说：“这是比球拍重要得多的武器。”“有了这个思想上的武器，才能统帅手中的球拍。”女队对毛主席的批示尤感亲切，她们从毛主席的批示得到了极为巨大的精神力量，擦亮了眼睛，开阔了心胸。郑敏之原来比较任性，她说：“为了世界上绝大多数人民的利益，我改！”她果真改了。李赫男、林慧卿、梁丽珍和郑敏之一样，也用毛主席指示的精神，检查和改正自己的缺点和错误。她们雄心勃勃去夺取世界冠军。
    当女队员们走上世界冠军的领奖台时，林慧卿发自内心地说：“这个‘翻身’仗靠的是毛泽东思想，一分为二真太伟大了。”
    要问他们怎么能在关键时刻过硬？周兰荪说：“二十六届比赛，我打一位世界强手，快赢球时，想起记者约我写稿，思想一开小差，球就哗啦一下输下来了。这几年，我努力学习毛主席著作，克服个人杂念，终于做到了比赛时高度集中，才有这次胜利。”的确，从当年的一念之差，到现在的高度集中，周兰荪整整花了四年的功夫。他的话解开了为什么在二十六届就早具实力的周兰荪，在二十八届才打出来的谜。队员们深深体会到思想改造的重要性，他们说：“出现在比赛中几秒钟的那一丝杂念，背后有着千丝万缕的联系呵！只有彻底克服个人主义，才能做到高度集中，全心全意地为人民服务。”
    在为祖国取得巨大荣誉之后，他们继续用毛泽东思想这个无比锋利的武器，对准自己的缺点错误毫不留情地开火。他们说：“对缺点的饶恕，就是对革命的过错。”当人们在报上看到庄则栋充满自我批评精神的文章，当有人听说乒乓球队开二十八届的总结会比打二十八届比赛还要惊心动魄时，禁不住问：“拿了世界冠军还检讨得那么厉害？”乒乓队员们纷纷回答说：“毛主席教导我们，万里长征才走了第一步，巩固胜利要花很大的气力。我们要保持世界冠军，技术要更上一层楼，必须思想先上一层楼”。“冠军可以到顶，为人民服务不会到顶。我们要从零开始，不断革命！”
    只有在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级世界冠军，才会有这种“刺破青天锷未残”的革命精神，才能讲得出这样生气勃勃的革命语言。
    这一切，说明乒乓球队在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下不断革命，胜利前进。在总结这次比赛经验的文章中，理所当然地要用那样的题目和那样的引证。资产阶级“权威”老爷们的种种篡改，真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”，到头来被粉碎的只能是他们自己。
    从根抓起　从零开始
    “从根抓起，从零开始”，这是中国乒乓球队运用毛泽东思想改造主客观世界的一条重要经验，也是充满无产阶级彻底革命精神的一个战斗口号。这个口号表明了乒乓球队的同志们坚持把学习毛主席著作当作一切工作的根本、从世界观的改造这一根本问题入手，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，无论取得多大成绩，都归功于党和人民，自己不背任何包袱，从零开始，不断革命。二十八届比赛后，中国乒乓球队进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，更加自觉地把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示，在“用”字上狠下功夫。这次访问日本、柬埔寨和叙利亚，无论是在旅途中，还是在旅馆里，都抓紧一切时间学习毛主席著作，即使在比赛最紧张的日子，也从不间断。访问期间，正值我国文化大革命进入高潮，他们更加把读毛主席的书当作革命的第一需要，念念不忘阶级斗争，始终以彻底革命的精神严格要求自己。
    出国访问的成功，充分显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，又一次给了资产阶级“权威”们有力的回击。
    牢记着毛主席为中国人民和世界人民服务的教导，庄则栋、林慧卿等在访问柬埔寨期间，尽管天气炎热，身体状况不太好，为了增进中柬两国人民之间的友谊，满足观众看比赛的要求，毫不吝惜自己的精力。有时比赛在雨后的露天场地进行，风大地湿，他们一次次拾起沾满泥水的球，尽力设法把球打好。这种无产阶级运动员的高尚品质，受到了柬埔寨人民的高度赞扬。
    去日本访问的是一支年轻的队伍，也是一支政治上较强的队伍。这次访日比赛是二十九届世界比赛前的一次实力较量，对于每个运动员来说，都是一个严峻的考验。要通过这次考验，首先取决于政治思想的保证。多年来，在乒乓球队里已经形成了一种风气，无论面临多么激烈的比赛，运动员敢于暴露思想问题，领导、战友勇于帮助，大胆接触问题的本质，不怕触痛灵魂深处，敢于“刺刀见红”。
    李赫男三胜世界冠军深津尚子和全队在名古屋最后一战，深刻地反映了这种革命精神。
    李赫男曾败在深津手下，这次头一场与深津相遇时，还有一些迷信。她大胆暴露了这种思想。容国团教练对她说：“要赢深津，就必须打掉‘怕’字，树立‘敢’字，斗倒‘我’字。”她觉得自己以前就有以胜败论英雄的毛病，怕输了别人瞧不起。带着这个问题她读了《纪念白求恩》，决心学习白求恩同志毫无自私自利之心的高尚品德，放下包袱，奋战获胜。在第二三次与深津交锋时，她又克服了思想上的“难”字和“保”字，终于三胜世界冠军。
    在名古屋打访日比赛的最后一仗，双方都排出了最强的阵容。中国队赛前思想工作做得很充分，临场气势很盛，男女团体赛获得全胜。当晚，一位日本乒乓球专家在招待会上对周兰荪说：“今天比赛，一看你们的决心就知道你们要胜了，因为你们在精神上压倒了我们。”这一点，不仅是他一个人感觉到了。当日本人纷纷探讨“中国乒乓球为什么进步那么快，那么厉害”时，许多报刊评论指出“装备有毛泽东思想武器的中国队到底与众不同”。日本名教练长谷川喜代太郎也说：“毛泽东思想深入到中国乒乓球队每个队员的心里。这一点体现在各场比赛中。这次访问日本的中国队比任何时候都强调学习毛泽东思想，对运动员的精神方面提出了既严格又体贴的要求。通过比赛，我深深体会到中国队员在学习毛泽东思想方面所收到的成效。”
    中国乒乓球队活学活用毛泽东思想所取得的巨大成就，连外国舆论都赞扬备至，那些资产阶级“权威”却一直顽固地攻击他们，这不正暴露了“学者权威”们反革命的真面目吗！
    乒乓球队的同志们还愤怒地指出：“物以类聚，人以群分。前北京市委的一个主要负责人，也曾以老爷式的态度训斥运动员：‘你们学这（指毛主席著作）干什么？不如去游泳，增加食欲。’邓拓反革命黑帮发出的大量毒箭中，也一而再、再而三地攻击我们乒乓球队，并把斗争锋芒指向毛泽东思想。如在《燕山夜话》的《“初生之犊不怕虎”》这篇黑话里，别有用心地攻击我队的新生力量，是‘初生的牛犊，实际上比不得老虎，只是不怕而已，也许是不懂得怕’。以此辱骂我们不怕强手是盲目的，是毛孩子的血气之勇，是阿Q的精神胜利法。并对毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断大唱反调。这完全证明，他们是一丘之貉。他们从反动的剥削阶级本能出发，总是千方百计地诋毁毛泽东思想，极端仇视广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。真理是骂不倒的，真理是在战斗中发展的。毛主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’敌人对毛泽东思想骂的越凶，我们就爱的越深。”
    在座谈中，大家一致反复强调指出：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是中国人民战无不胜的强大武器，也是世界革命人民战无不胜的强大武器。毛主席的话水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句，用到那儿那儿灵。我们学一点就用一点，用一点就进一步。我们的每一次胜利，每一个进步，都是在毛泽东思想指引下取得的。有了毛泽东思想的精神武装，我们的心最齐，眼最亮，胆子最大，士气最旺，在阶级斗争中就不怕任何牛鬼蛇神，在球场上就不怕任何强手。毛泽东思想是照耀我们成长壮大的红太阳，是我们胜利前进的根本保证。我们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。我们一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。谁要反对毛泽东思想，谁就是反革命，谁就是修正主义。这些资产阶级‘权威’和邓拓等牛鬼蛇神极力阻挠、反对我们活学活用毛泽东思想，就是企图复辟资本主义，这是白日作梦！我们一定要更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，和全国工农兵群众一起，坚决捍卫党中央、毛主席，捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神！挖掉修正主义的根，灭绝资产阶级的种！”
    以上就是我们对于中国乒乓球队各次座谈会的记述。这个简要记述，可以告诉人们，乒乓球队的同志们在毛泽东思想指引下前进的途中，并不是一帆风顺的。他们时时遭到资产阶级“权威”老爷们的明枪和暗箭，他们的阳关大道正是在同明枪和暗箭的斗争中开辟出来的。
    读者们，您们可曾想到，这个受到亿万人民热爱的红色球队会遭受到如此恶毒的攻击和污蔑吗？当然，仔细一想，也将不会感到奇怪。人民之所爱，正是敌人之所恨，敌人不恨，小将们也就不那么可爱了！资产阶级“权威”老爷们所恨的，归根到底是毛泽东思想；我们所爱的，归根到底也是毛泽东思想。正是在这一点上，我们同资产阶级“权威”们有着不共戴天的仇恨，也正是在这一点上，我们正同他们进行着你死我活的斗争。现在，已经到了横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的时候了。全国在战斗，乒乓球队的同志们在战斗，让我们同他们一起去冲锋陷阵，夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利吧！
