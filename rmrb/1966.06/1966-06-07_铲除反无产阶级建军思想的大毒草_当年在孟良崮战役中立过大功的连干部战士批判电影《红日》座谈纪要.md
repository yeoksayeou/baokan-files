    Eradicate the Poisonous Weed of Anti-Proletarian Military Thinking
    —Summary of a Forum Criticizing the Film "Red Sun" by Cadres and Soldiers of a Company That Made Great Contributions in the Menglianggu Campaign

    The company that made great contributions in the Menglianggu Campaign participated in the final battle to encircle and annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's so-called Five Main Forces—the 74th Division. At that time, they were like a steel knife, piercing forty miles into the enemy's depths, attacking in the east, defending in the west, blocking on the left, and resisting on the right, always holding their ground firmly. Finally, they fiercely attacked Menglianggu, fighting bravely and tenaciously, advancing wave upon wave, actively cooperating with neighboring units, forcing the enemy to be completely annihilated. After the battle, the entire company was collectively awarded a major merit. The Third Platoon was named "Zhao Liang Platoon," and the Fifth Platoon was named "Cao Xiangzuo Platoon."

    Now, twenty years have passed, and the glorious history of this company in that battle has taken root in the hearts of generations of new recruits. The glorious tradition of this company has been carried forward by batch after batch of successors. These descendants of heroes, after watching the film "Red Sun," which reflects the Menglianggu Campaign, could not help but feel their hearts burn with anger. They said, "This is a poisonous arrow that fabricates the 'glorious' history of the enemy army, slanders the glorious tradition of our army, and opposes the Party and the people." "This is a poisonous weed that sings a tune opposite to Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian military line!"

    Here, we only record excerpts of the speeches of some comrades of this company criticizing "Red Sun." These cadres and soldiers used the historical facts of how revolutionary predecessors fought the Menglianggu Campaign and their own experiences after joining the revolutionary ranks to expose the reactionary essence of the film "Red Sun."

    Huang Chengshun (leader of the "Zhao Liang Platoon"):

    The film "Red Sun" tries every possible means to beautify the class enemy. It is a thorough poisonous weed that "praises and sings the praises of" the 74th Division, one of the pillars of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, and opposes the Party and the people. Look, the enemy's planes and artillery bombarded the city of Lianshui, shaking it. The pagodas and tiles flew in all directions, a sea of fire, a scene of ruins, and the reactionary 74th Division strutted and swaggered, surging forward "wave upon wave." The film not only promotes the enemy's strength and the horror of war from a positive perspective, but also uses the perspective of our troops' cadres and soldiers to highlight the enemy's strength and the horror of war. The political commissar said: "The 74th Division cannot be solved in one or two rounds." Even when the 74th Division had been surrounded by our hundreds of thousands of troops and had nowhere to escape, they still use the mouths of our soldiers to highlight the enemy's strength. Zhang Delai said: "Good heavens, (the shells) are coming down like dumplings." May I ask the film's directors, isn't this beautifying the enemy? It is clear that you yourselves have been frightened by the enemy's planes, artillery, and atomic bombs, and you vainly want to call on us to follow you, lay down our guns, not to offend the reactionaries, and not to make revolution. This cannot be done!

    Chairman Mao taught us: "The people, not one or two new weapons, determine the outcome of the war." "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," and final victory will surely belong to the progressive people. Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never be afraid of war or atomic bombs, because we understand that only through war can war be eliminated. Our old squad leader, Zhao Liang, had both eyes blinded in the Menglianggu Campaign, but he still lay in the trench and encouraged the whole squad: "Resolutely eliminate the enemy!" He fought until his last breath. This is the proletarian backbone. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow in the footsteps of the old squad leader, and carry the revolution through to the end!

    Cai Mingqi (communications soldier):

    The film "Red Sun" not only obliterates the great political significance of the Liberation War, but also blatantly fabricates history, portraying our cadres and soldiers as a group of muddleheaded soldiers who do not know or refuse to implement the strategic policies formulated by Chairman Mao. More than four months before the Lianshui battle, Chairman Mao instructed: "The method of operation to defeat Chiang Kai-shek is generally mobile warfare. Therefore, the temporary abandonment of certain places and certain cities is not only inevitable but also necessary. The temporary abandonment of certain places and certain cities is to achieve final victory, otherwise final victory cannot be achieved." At that time, the propaganda officer of our regiment composed such a song:

      Pull up your two nimble legs,
      Faster than Shenxing Taibao,
      Fighting north and south,
      Confusing the enemy.…………
      Nimble legs run fast,
      Chiang Kai-shek's army is doomed;
      Nimble legs run fast,
      Big and small victories will come.

    This song was sung with great enthusiasm during the battle of Menglianggu. This shows that Chairman Mao's instructions were known not only to senior cadres but also to our broad masses of soldiers.

    The director claimed that he specifically "studied Volume Four of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong" when filming this movie. If so, why does the content written contradict Mao Zedong's military thinking? This is an admission of guilt. It turns out that you are deliberately committing crimes, intentionally waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag.

    Yang Shushan (company commander):

    The film depicts a so-called "heroic" company without Mao Zedong Thought, without Party leadership, without political work. From the company commander to the soldiers, they are a group of unorganized, undisciplined, arrogant mobs without heads, without souls, who do not know for whom they are soldiers or for whom they are fighting.

    Take Company Commander Shi Donggen, for example. This is a "hero" that the film's directors painstakingly fabricated. He is a military rascal, a nincompoop, and a drunkard whose mind is devoid of politics and military strategy, and who is seriously unorganized and undisciplined. He does not possess even the slightest scent of an ordinary revolutionary cadre, let alone a heroic image. I have participated in the revolution for many years and have never seen or heard of such a company commander in the revolutionary army. I cannot believe that such a company commander can command a victory and make great contributions.

    During the Menglianggu Campaign, our old company commander, Sha Wei, also made great contributions. After the troops captured Height 540, the enemy counterattacked frantically, attempting to escape. He discovered that the position of a fraternal company was in danger, so he reported to his superiors while decisively leading the Second Platoon to attack. In the battle, he was wounded in two places but still insisted on his command post, finally cooperating with neighboring units to consolidate the position and create conditions for the final encirclement and annihilation of the enemy. This is the real hero. Later, he died in another battle. To this day, when all the comrades in our company think of him, we feel proud. We will never allow anyone to slander our heroes, and we will never allow anyone to smear the faces of our heroes.

    Tang Dehua (platoon leader):

    The platoon leader Yang Jun in the film is also a so-called "hero" that the directors are trying to promote. However, this hero only has hatred and no resentment. When A Ju accused the whole platoon of how the reactionaries killed his father, he only rushed out of the gate and vented his grief for a while, without showing any hatred. Writing in this way actually covers up class contradictions and removes the true driving force that enables our cadres and soldiers to move forward bravely in battle, and removes the fundamental reason why ordinary soldiers can become heroes.

    In battle, this "hero" only knows how to obey orders and does not adhere to principles. When attacking the bunkers at Tusikou, he clearly saw through the enemy's conspiracy to feign surrender. As a member of the company's collective leadership, he should adhere to principles. If the company commander does not listen, he can put forward his own opinions. However, he carried out the wrong order, causing unnecessary sacrifices. Here, the film's directors intentionally oppose obeying orders and listening to commands to the three major democracies, and oppose flexible and mobile strategies and tactics. The directors had to fabricate such a plot. Isn't this intentionally vilifying our heroes?

    Du Yaosong (leader of the "Cao Xiangzuo Platoon")

    After watching the squad leader Qin Shouben in the movie, I immediately thought of our old squad leader Cao Xiangzuo. The more I compared them, the more angry I became. During the Menglianggu Campaign, in order to prevent the enemy from escaping, our old squad leader led the entire squad to stand firm on Height 540. The enemy's shrapnel tore through his abdomen, and his intestines poured out of the wound. His whole body was covered in blood. A soldier tore off his own bandage to bandage him, but he pushed the soldier's hand away and shouted: "Leave me alone, hold off the enemy!" With one hand covering his stomach and the other hand picking up a grenade, he bit off the fuse and threw five in a row. The enemy was repulsed, and our heroic squad leader fell. At the point of death, he tightly bit down on the last fuse in his mouth. To commemorate the heroic sacrifice of the old squad leader, our squad was named "Cao Xiangzuo Platoon." However, what kind of heroic scent does the squad leader Qin Shouben in the movie have? In several battles, we didn't see him playing any role. We only saw him scolding soldiers and putting big "hats" on soldiers at every turn. How can such a squad leader represent our heroic squad leader? Absolutely not! Why did the author abandon writing about so many heroes like Cao Xiangzuo and instead write about such a useless squad leader? How can this not make people feel angry!

    Sun Guojun (soldier):

    In this film, from the army commander to the soldiers, there is not a single true heroic image. What kind of people are our soldiers in the movie? Some are cowards who are afraid of death after suffering a little injury. Some are spoiled soldiers who are afraid of hardship and cannot even swallow white pancakes. Some are confused soldiers who are always listless and want to doze off as soon as they sit down. Some are short-sighted and don't want to make revolution as soon as they leave home. Some worship the class enemy, are afraid of planes and artillery, and always act as voluntary propagandists for the enemy. Some are unimaginably gluttonous, always wanting to eat good things and can violate the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" at will. ... Even more viciously, even the physiological defect of stuttering is forcibly placed on the soldiers as material to attack and slander heroic images. In short, the film's directors have really racked their brains to uglify us in every soldier and every small detail. May I ask, what is your intention in uglifying the revolutionary soldiers who participated in such a great Liberation War into this appearance? Which side do you stand on? Isn't this crystal clear!

    Yang Qinglong (deputy instructor):

    What exactly is the film "Red Sun"? Through everyone's analysis, we can see it very clearly. It is worth noting that this film was released in 1963. At that time, Volume Four of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong had already been published. The resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960 had been implemented in the troops. Under the leadership of the new Military Commission, our entire army experienced a struggle between the two military thinking and the two military lines of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, crushed the rampant attack of the right-leaning opportunists, raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, adhered to the four firsts, promoted the three-eight style, promoted the three major democracies, created the four-good movement, and strode forward towards being extremely proletarian and extremely combatant! At such a time, as a military film reflecting a battle in the great Liberation War, it should and could have fully embodied these spirits to achieve the purpose of educating the troops and attacking the enemy.

    However, the film "Red Sun," which claims to take Volume Four of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong as its guide, is everywhere in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, everywhere in opposition to the proletarian military line, and everywhere in opposition to the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960. Chairman Mao said: "War can only be eliminated through war. If you don't want guns, you must pick up guns." The film "Red Sun" vigorously promotes that all wars are wrong, cruel, and meaningless, and wants us to lay down our guns and not make revolution. Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." The film "Red Sun" beautifies the enemy as real tigers and iron tigers. Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, the people will have nothing." The film "Red Sun" uglifies our army as a group of soulless mobs. Chairman Mao said: "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and we will never allow the gun to command the Party." The film "Red Sun" cancels the leadership of the Party and blatantly promotes pure military viewpoints. The resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission pointed out: "Political work is the lifeline of our army." The film "Red Sun" deliberately removes this lifeline and viciously distorts and slanders a series of principles and systems of our army's political work... Film directors, where exactly do you want to lead us? Aren't you concentrating on selling revisionist goods? Aren't you waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag? No wonder even foreign revisionists applaud you. It turns out that you are wearing the same pants as modern revisionists. Seeing that the situation is "bad," you quickly "emerge" and vigorously oppose us.

    Chairman Mao told us a truth: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support; whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." The more vigorously you oppose, the more it proves that we are doing the right thing. You want to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the proletarian military line. This is wishful thinking. Your opposition will not only not harm us in the slightest, but it will also sharpen our eyes, see the existence of class enemies who do not carry guns, make us finally see through you, and resolve to fight you to the end, and we will never stop until we win complete victory! Your opposition has once again made us understand the great significance of holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Every soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will forever follow the Party, follow Chairman Mao, follow in the footsteps of revolutionary predecessors, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end!

    铲除反无产阶级建军思想的大毒草
    ——当年在孟良崮战役中立过大功的连干部战士批判电影《红日》座谈纪要
    当年在孟良崮战役中立过大功的连，他们参加了这次战役中最后围歼蒋介石的所谓五大主力之一——七十四师的战斗。当时，他们象一把钢刀，猛插敌人纵深四十里，东攻西防，左堵右抗，始终顶得住、站得牢；最后猛攻孟良崮，英勇顽强，前赴后继，主动协同友邻，迫敌全部就歼。战后，全连集体记大功一次。三班被命名为“赵良班”，五班被命名为“曹相佐班”。
    如今，二十年过去了，这个连在这次战役中的光荣历史，已在一代代新人的心中扎根；这个连队的光荣传统，已被一批批接班人发扬光大。这些英雄的后代，看了反映孟良崮战役的电影《红日》以后，不由得人人心中烧起了满腔怒火。他们说：“这是一支伪造敌军‘光荣’历史，污蔑我军光荣传统，反党反人民的毒箭”，“这是一棵与毛泽东思想唱对台戏，与无产阶级建军路线唱对台戏的大毒草！”
    这里，我们仅仅记录了这个连部分同志批判《红日》的发言摘要。这些干部战士用革命前辈怎样打孟良崮战役的历史事实，用自己参加革命队伍后的切身经历，揭发了电影《红日》的反动本质。
    黄承顺（“赵良班”班长）：
    电影《红日》千方百计美化阶级敌人，这是一棵彻头彻尾替蒋介石反动统治的支柱之一——七十四师“歌功颂德”，反党反人民的大毒草。瞧，敌人的飞机大炮轰得涟水城直晃荡。打得宝塔瓦砾纷飞，一片火海，一片废墟，反动派七十四师耀武扬威，“前赴后继”地涌上来。电影不但从正面宣扬敌人厉害，战争可怕，而且还从我们部队干部战士的角度来衬托敌人厉害，战争可怕。军政委说：“七十四师不是一、二个回合可以解决的。”甚至在七十四师已经被我们几十万大军围得走投无路时，还要用我们战士的嘴巴来突出一下敌人的厉害，张德来说：“乖乖，（炮弹）同下饺子一样。”请问电影的编导，你们这不是美化敌人是什么？分明是你们自己被敌人的飞机大炮原子弹吓昏了，妄想叫我们也跟着你们走，放下枪杆，不要触犯反动派，不要干革命，这办不到！
    毛主席教导我们：“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，最后胜利必将属于代表进步的人民。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，是绝对不会害怕战争，害怕原子弹的，因为我们懂得，只有用战争才能消灭战争。我们的老班长赵良，在孟良崮战役中，两只眼睛都被打瞎了，还躺在战壕里鼓动全班：“坚决消灭敌人！”一直战斗到最后一口气。这才是无产阶级硬骨头，我们一定听毛主席的话，踏着老班长的足迹，把革命进行到底！
    蔡明棋（通讯员）：
    电影《红日》，不但抹煞了解放战争的伟大政治意义，而且明目张胆地伪造历史，把我们的干部战士，写成一伙不知道、或者拒不执行毛主席制定的战略方针的糊涂兵。涟水战斗发生的四个多月前，毛主席就指示：“战胜蒋介石的作战方法，一般地是运动战。因此，若干地方，若干城市的暂时放弃，不但是不可避免的，而且是必要的。暂时放弃若干地方若干城市，是为了取得最后胜利，否则就不能取得最后胜利。”那时节，我们团的宣传股长编了这样一首歌：
      拉起两条飞毛腿，
      赛过神行太保快如飞，
      南征北战到处跑，
      弄得敌人莫名其妙。…………
      飞毛腿呀跑得快，
      蒋介石的军队要倒霉；
      飞毛腿呀跑得快，
      大大小小的胜利都会来。
    这首歌，打孟良崮时大家唱得真来劲。这说明，毛主席的指示，不但高级干部知道，就连我们广大战士，都人人知道。
    导演自称拍这部片子时，专门
  “学习了《毛泽东选集》第四卷”，既然这样，为什么写出来的东西，偏偏与毛主席军事思想唱对台戏呢？这才是不打自招，原来你们是明知故犯，存心打着“红旗”反红旗。
    杨树山（连长）：
    电影写的一个所谓“英雄”连队，没有毛泽东思想、没有党的领导、没有政治工作，从连长到战士，都是一批没有头脑，没有灵魂，不知道为谁当兵，为谁打仗，无组织无纪律，骄气十足的乌合之众。
    就说连长石东根，这是电影编导煞费苦心捏造出来的一个“英雄”。他，是一个头脑里既没有政治，也没有军事，严重的无组织无纪律的一个兵痞、一个草包，一个酒鬼。在他身上，连一点普通革命干部的气味都没有，更不用说是英雄形象了。我参加革命也不少年了，从来没有见过、也没有听说过，革命部队里有这样的连长，更不能相信，这样的连长能指挥打胜仗，立大功。
    孟良崮战役中，我们老连长沙苇，也是立了大功的。部队打下540高地以后，敌人疯狂反扑，企图夺路逃窜。他发现兄弟连队阵地危急，便一面报告上级，一边当机立断，带了二排杀了上去。战斗中，他两处负伤，还坚持在指挥岗位上，终于协同友邻，巩固了阵地，为最后围歼敌人，创造了条件。这才是真正的英雄。后来他在另一次战役中牺牲了，直到今天，我们全连同志，一想起他来，就感到自豪。我们决不允许任何人污蔑我们的英雄，也决不允许往我们英雄的脸上抹灰。
    唐德华（排长）：
    电影中的排长杨军，也是编导者着力宣扬的一个所谓“英雄”。但是，这个英雄，光有仇，没有恨。当阿菊向全排控诉反动派怎样杀害了他的父亲时，他只是冲出大门，发泄一阵子悲痛了事，看不出有一点仇恨。这样写，实际上是掩盖阶级矛盾，抽掉了我们的干部战士之所以能在战斗中一往无前的真正动力，抽掉了普通战士之所以能成为英雄的根本原因。
    在战斗中，这个“英雄”只知道唯命是从，不坚持原则。吐丝口打碉堡，他明明识破了敌人假投降的阴谋，作为连队集体领导成员之一，应该坚持原则，连长不听，可以拿出自己的主张来，然而他却执行了错误的命令，造成了无谓的牺牲。这里，电影编导者是有意把服从命令听指挥与三大民主对立起来，与灵活机动的战略战术对立起来。编导者却硬要编排这么一个情节，这不是有意丑化我们的英雄是什么？杜尧松（“曹相佐班”班长）
    看了电影里的班长秦守本，使我马上想起我们的老班长曹相佐，比来比去，越比越有气。孟良崮战役中，为了不让敌人逃窜，我们的老班长带领全班，坚守在540高地上。敌人的炮弹片，划破了他的腹部，肠子从伤口涌了出来，他全身成了个血人。一个战士扯下自己的绷带，想给他包扎，他却推开战士的手叫道：“别管我，抵住敌人！”说着，一手捂着肚子，一手拾起手榴弹，咬断弹弦，接连投出了五颗。敌人被打退了，我们的英雄班长也倒下了，临终，他嘴里还紧紧咬着最后一根弹弦。为了纪念英勇牺牲的老班长，我们班被命名为“曹相佐班”。但是，电影里的班长秦守本，又有一点什么样的英雄气味，几次战斗，看不到他起一点作用，只看到他动不动训战士，给战士扣大“帽子”。这样的班长，怎么能代表我们的英雄班长，绝对不能！作者为什么放着许许多多曹相佐式的英雄不写，偏要写这样一个没有用的班长。这怎么不令人感到气愤！
    孙国钧（战士）：
    这部片子，上至军长，下至战士，没有一个真正的英雄形象。我们的战士，在电影里是一批什么样的人呢？有的是负了一点伤，便愁眉苦脸的怕死鬼；有的是怕苦畏难，雪白的煎饼还咽不下口的少爷兵；有的是成天萎靡不振，一坐下来就想打瞌睡的迷糊兵；有的眼光短浅，一离开家门就不想干革命了；有的崇拜阶级敌人，害怕飞机大炮，老是替敌人当义务宣传员；有的嘴馋得不象样，老是想吃好的，可以随便违反“三大纪律、八项注意”。……更恶毒的是，连结巴子这种生理缺陷，也硬把它安到战士身上去，作为攻击污蔑英雄形象的材料。总而言之，电影的编导，真正挖空心思，在每一个战士、每一个细小情节上，来丑化我们。请问，你们把参加这样一个伟大的解放战争的革命战士，丑化成这副样子，到底居心何在？你们的立场站在哪一边，这不是清清楚楚的了吗！
    杨青龙（副指导员）：
    电影《红日》到底是一个什么货色？通过大家的分析，我们便看得很清楚了。值得注意的是，这部片子出在一九六三年。那时节，《毛泽东选集》第四卷早已出版；一九六○年军委扩大会议决议已在部队贯彻执行，我们全军上下，在新的军委领导下，经历了一场资产阶级与无产阶级两种建军思想，两条建军路线的斗争，粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，大创四好运动，向着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化阔步前进！在这样的时候，本来，作为一部反映伟大的解放战争中一个战役的军事影片，应该也完全可能体现这些精神，以达到教育部队，打击敌人的目的。
    但是，自称为以《毛泽东选集》第四卷为指针的电影《红日》，却处处和毛泽东思想唱对台戏，处处和无产阶级建军路线唱对台戏，处处和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议唱对台戏。毛主席说：“只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子”。电影《红日》却大肆宣扬一切战争都是错误的、残酷的、毫无意义的，想让我们放下枪杆子，不要革命；毛主席说：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，电影《红日》却把敌人美化为真老虎、铁老虎；毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”电影《红日》却把我们的军队丑化为一群没灵魂的乌合之众；毛主席说：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”。电影《红日》却取消了党的领导，明目张胆地宣扬单纯军事观点；军委扩大会议决议指出：“政治工作是我军的生命线”，电影《红日》却偏偏抽去了这条生命线，恶毒地歪曲、污蔑我军政治工作的一系列原则和制度……电影编导者，你们到底要把我们引到哪里去？你们不是集中地贩卖修正主义的货色是什么？你们不是打着“红旗”反红旗是什么？怪不得连外国的修正主义分子也为你们拍手叫好。原来你们与现代修正主义穿着一条裤子，眼看形势“不妙”，于是赶快“出笼”，大肆反对我们。
    毛主席告诉我们一个真理：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”你们反对得越起劲，证明我们做得越对，你们想反党、反社会主义、反无产阶级的建军路线，这是妄想。你们的反对，不仅不能损害我们一根毫毛，反而使我们擦亮了眼睛，看到了不拿枪的阶级敌人的存在，使我们终于识破了你们，下定决心与你们斗到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！你们的反对，反而使我们又一次懂得了高举毛泽东思想红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的重大意义。我们中国人民解放军的每一个战士，将永远跟着党，跟着毛主席，踏着革命先辈的足迹，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
