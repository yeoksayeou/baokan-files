    Our socialist cultural revolution, which involves 650 million people in China, will surely greatly enhance the socialist consciousness of our people, greatly promote the spirit of socialist revolution, greatly accelerate the process of our socialist construction, and ensure that our party and country will never become revisionist and will never be peacefully evolved into capitalist restoration. Only in this way can the Chinese people better support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Chen Ziping, the head of the diplomatic corps of various countries stationed in China and the Vietnamese Ambassador to China, held a banquet tonight to thank the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for organizing a trip to Shandong Province for the heads of the diplomatic missions in China.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi was invited to attend the banquet. In his speech at the banquet, he spoke about the great significance of the Socialist Cultural Revolution currently underway in China. He said that our Socialist Cultural Revolution is a matter of paramount importance for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. At the same time, conducting such a vigorous and thorough cultural revolution in China, with its 650 million people, cannot but have a profound impact on the world. The Chinese people are determined to carry this great revolution through to the end. We believe that through this struggle, the socialist consciousness of our people will be greatly enhanced, the spirit of socialist revolution will be greatly promoted, the process of our socialist construction will be greatly accelerated, and it will be ensured that our party and country will never become revisionist and will never be peacefully evolved into capitalist restoration. Only in this way can the Chinese people better support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.
    Ambassador Chen Ziping spoke first at the banquet. He said that this visit has left us with a good impression. We are pleased to see that the people of Shandong Province, under the leadership of the Chinese government, have achieved many great successes in building a new life. Now, together with the people of the whole country, they are using their wisdom and labor to build their motherland more beautifully. This visit has helped us to learn more about China. We firmly believe that this will help further strengthen the friendly relations between the people of all countries and the Chinese people. We once again express our heartfelt gratitude.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said at the banquet that through this trip, you can see that China's socialist construction is developing day by day, that you can see the new revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people and how Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated the hearts of the people. Through the trip, you can personally feel the sincere friendship of the Chinese people towards the people of all countries and international friends. I believe that such a trip will help enhance mutual understanding and friendship between us.
    He said that at present, the domestic situation in our country is very good. Our socialist construction has achieved great success in all aspects, a new upsurge of production and construction has emerged across the country, and the entire national economy has entered a new period of great leap forward. This is the result of the Chinese people adhering to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and adhering to the socialist revolution. However, we clearly know that there are still many shortcomings in our construction work. We sincerely welcome criticisms and opinions from the heads of diplomatic missions and friends from all countries.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that some friends said that it is easier to understand why the Chinese people love Chairman Mao's works so much if you leave the city of Beijing and go to see the outside world. I think this is very true. Now, the Chinese people are launching a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works. This is a movement of great historical significance. Chairman Mao has ingeniously, creatively, and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. In the long revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people have deeply realized that the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the masses, can change the spiritual outlook of the masses and be transformed into a huge material force. Our people and our country, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be able to make greater and greater contributions to the cause of human liberation and progress.
    He said that our country is currently undergoing a vigorous Socialist Cultural Revolution. The occurrence of this great revolution is the inevitable result of the historical development of our country. Because the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits created by all exploiting classes over thousands of years have hindered the continued advancement of our socialist revolution and socialist construction, and poisoned our people, they must be thoroughly criticized and thoroughly eliminated. The broad masses of the people need to create and form new proletarian ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits in order to consolidate our proletarian dictatorship and socialist economic base, and to promote the continuous development of our entire socialist construction. The method we use to carry out this great revolution is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the old things mentioned above. We rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. Our targets of attack are limited to a small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary bad elements; for the large number of intellectuals from the old society, we still adopt the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming them.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that today, we are able to launch such a vigorous Cultural Revolution and eliminate a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in this revolutionary struggle, which precisely demonstrates that our country is unprecedentedly consolidated and unified, and shows that our party will be more pure and consolidated, and more combative. Friends present can see that facts will prove this.
    He said that facing this great revolution, a small handful of overthrown exploiting class elements are still not reconciled to withdrawing from the stage of history and are still making a dying struggle. Not long ago, the case of counter-revolutionary element Yang Guoqing wounding international friends in Beijing was a reflection of this dying struggle. Today, China's proletarian dictatorship is incomparably strong and consolidated. Any counter-revolutionary element who dares to carry out conspiratorial sabotage activities will surely be subjected to devastating blows. The counter-revolutionary criminal Yang Guoqing has already received the punishment he deserves. His evil attempt to deliberately undermine the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world has completely failed. The friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces.
    Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Wang Bingnan, Han Nianlong and others were invited to attend the banquet.
    The heads of diplomatic missions from various countries stationed in China attended the banquet.
    After the banquet held by Chen Ziping, head of the diplomatic corps, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held an art performance to entertain the heads of diplomatic missions stationed in China.

    陈毅副总理谈我国社会主义革命和建设的新形势
    中国人民学习毛主席著作的运动有伟大意义
    社会主义文化大革命将对世界产生深远影响
    我们六亿五千万人口的中国进行轰轰烈烈的、彻底的社会主义文化大革命，必将大大提高我国人民的社会主义觉悟，大大发扬社会主义革命的精神，大大加速我国社会主义建设的进程，保证我们的党和国家永远不变成修正主义，永远不被和平演变到资本主义复辟。只有这样，中国人民才能更好地支援世界人民的革命斗争。
    新华社二十日讯　各国驻中国外交使节团团长、越南驻中国大使陈子平，今晚举行宴会，答谢我国外交部组织各国驻华使节赴山东省旅行。
    陈毅副总理应邀出席了宴会。他在宴会上讲话时，谈到了当前我国正在进行的社会主义文化大革命的重大意义。他说，我们的社会主义文化大革命是关系到中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的头等大事，同时，在我们六亿五千万人口的中国，进行这样一场轰轰烈烈的、彻底的文化大革命，不能不在世界上发生深远的影响。中国人民决心把这场大革命进行到底。我们相信，通过这场斗争，必将大大提高我国人民的社会主义觉悟，大大发扬社会主义革命的精神，大大加速我国社会主义建设的进程，并且保证我们的党和国家永远不变成修正主义，永远不被和平演变到资本主义复辟。只有这样，中国人民才能更好地支援世界人民的革命斗争。
    陈子平大使在宴会上首先讲话。他说，这次参观访问给我们留下了良好的印象。我们高兴地看到，山东省人民在中国政府的领导下，在建设新生活方面取得了许多巨大的成绩。现在，他们正同全国人民一起，用自己的智慧和劳动，把自己的祖国建设得更美丽。这次参观访问，帮助我们更多地了解中国。我们深信，这一点将有助于进一步加强各国人民同中国人民的友好关系。我们再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上说，通过这次旅行，你们可以看到我国社会主义建设事业正在日益发展，可以看到中国人民崭新的革命精神面貌和毛泽东思想深入人心的一切情况。通过旅行，你们可以亲身感受到中国人民对各国人民和国际友人的真挚友情。我相信，这样的旅行有助于增进我们之间的相互了解和友谊的。
    他说，目前，我国国内的形势很好。我国社会主义建设在各方面取得了巨大成就，全国出现了一个生产建设的新高潮，整个国民经济进入了一个新的跃进时期。这是中国人民坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持社会主义革命的结果。但是，我们清楚地知道，在我们的建设工作中还有不少缺点。我们十分诚恳地欢迎各国使节们、朋友们提出批评和意见。
    陈毅副总理说，有的朋友说，离开北京城，到外地去看一看，就更容易懂得中国人民群众为什么那样热爱毛主席著作。我认为，这话说得很对。现在，中国人民正在掀起一个学习毛主席著作的热潮。这是一个具有伟大历史意义的运动。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。中国人民在长期的革命斗争中，深切地体会到，毛泽东思想的旗帜是胜利的旗帜。毛泽东思想掌握了人民群众，就能够改变人民群众的精神面貌，化为巨大的物质力量。我们的人民、我们的国家在毛泽东思想指导下，一定能够对人类的解放和进步事业，作出越来越大的贡献。
    他说，目前我国正在进行着一场轰轰烈烈的社会主义文化大革命。这场大革命的发生，是我国历史发展的必然结果。因为几千年来一切剥削阶级所造成的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，阻碍着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的继续前进，毒害着我国人民，必须彻底批判，彻底破除。广大人民群众需要创造和形成无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，以便巩固我们的无产阶级专政和社会主义经济基础，推动我们整个社会主义建设事业不断向前发展。我们进行这场大革命的方法是，用毛泽东思想为武器，对上面所说的旧东西进行批判。我们依靠的是广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子。我们的打击对象只限于一小撮反党、反社会主义、反革命的坏人；对于数量众多的来自旧社会的知识分子，我们仍然采取团结、教育和改造的方针。
    陈毅副总理强调说，今天，我们能够发动这样一场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，并且在这场革命斗争中淘汰一小撮反党反社会主义分子，正是说明了我们国家空前巩固和统一，表明我们的党将会更加纯洁和巩固，更加有战斗力。在座的朋友们可以看到事实将会证明这一点。
    他说，面对着这场大革命，一小撮被推翻了的剥削阶级分子还不甘心退出历史舞台，还在作着垂死的挣扎。不久以前，在北京发生的反革命分子杨国庆砍伤国际友人的案件，就是这种垂死挣扎的反映。今天，中国的无产阶级专政无比地强大和巩固，任何反革命分子胆敢进行阴谋破坏活动，一定会遭到毁灭性的打击。反革命罪犯杨国庆已经得到应有的惩罚，他蓄意破坏中国人民同世界人民友谊的罪恶企图完全落空了，中国人民和世界各国人民的友谊是任何反动势力破坏不了的。
    外交部副部长姬鹏飞、王炳南、韩念龙等应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的有各国驻中国的使节。
    我国外交部在使节团团长陈子平举行宴会以后，举办了文艺晚会，招待各国驻中国的使节。
