    Jinan, June 23 (Xinhua) - A new tool capable of greatly reducing the physical labor of miners – the first domestically produced new type of automated loading machine – was recently born at the Jinan Heavy Machinery Plant. Operated by just one person, it can complete the three operations of loading, transporting, and unloading in mine roadways, doing the work of two hundred workers.
    The birth of this loading machine solves a key problem in the transportation of mine roadways in our country. Currently, loading and transporting in our country's mine roadways is done by manual loading, with rock loaders or coal loaders transporting and unloading minerals along railway tracks. This is inefficient, workers are exhausted, and activities are very inflexible due to the limitations of the tracks. The new pneumatic loading machine has tires as its wheels, is not restricted by tracks, moves flexibly, and has a wide range of movement, thereby correspondingly increasing the speed of mining and tunneling and greatly reducing the physical labor of miners.
    This automated loading machine was created by the staff of the Jinan Heavy Machinery Plant, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully promoted the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and adopted the method of a "three-in-one" combination of workers, leading cadres, and technicians.

    济南制成第一台新型自动化装运机
    据新华社济南二十三日电　能够大大减轻采矿工人体力劳动的新利器——第一台国产新型自动化装运机，最近在济南重型机械厂诞生。它只要由一人操作，就能完成矿井巷道装、运、卸三种作业，工作起来能顶两百个工人。
    这一装运机的诞生，解决了我国矿井巷道运输的关键问题。目前我国的矿井巷道装运是由人工装，用装岩机或装煤机沿铁轨运输、卸矿，效率低，工人劳累，又因受轨道的限制，活动很不灵便。新的汽动装运机的行走轮是轮胎的，不受轨道限制，行走灵便，活动范围较广，从而相应地提高了采矿掘进速度，大大减轻了采矿工人的体力劳动。
    这台自动化装运机，是济南重型机械厂职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分发扬自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，采取工人、领导干部和技术人员三结合的办法制成的。
