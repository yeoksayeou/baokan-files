    Thoroughly Uproot Kuang Yaming's Black Flag of "Three-Seven Split Between Red and Expert"
    After the anti-Party black gang leader Kuang Yaming sneaked into Nanjing University, he blatantly formulated a complete set of bourgeois and revisionist education lines for Nanjing University. For more than three years, he comprehensively tampered with Mao Zedong's educational thought, abolished the Party's education policy, and vigorously peddled revisionist black goods.
    The notorious "three-seven split between red and expert" formula put forward by Kuang Yaming is one of the specimens of his fervent promotion of the bourgeois and revisionist education line. Kuang Yaming is a veteran who waves the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. He also added a layer of protection to himself on the issue of the relationship between red and expert. His "three-seven split between red and expert" fallacy is more deceptive and confusing than the naked advocacy of taking the white and expert road. His "three-seven split between red and expert" fallacy first appeared in the limelight at a forum of seven "best" college entrance examination candidates in 1963. Later, as the first secretary of the Party committee, he peddled this black good to organizations at all levels and published it in the school's *Forward* newspaper, poisoning many young students.
    At the forum of seven "best" college entrance examination candidates in 1963, he went into battle stripped to the waist and said recklessly: "We shout the slogan 'Down with imperialism,' this is red; how to overthrow it, this is expert. Study should also be 'three-seven' split, and we should put our energy into studying. To attack the fortress, we must make arduous efforts... We must use three-tenths of our energy to establish a world outlook."
    He told us to only use "three-tenths of our energy to establish a world outlook," that is, to use it on red, on politics, and to use "seven-tenths" of our energy on learning, that is, to use it on expert, on professional work. This is to try our best to advocate that a person's ideological transformation and the establishment of a proletarian world outlook are insignificant, and that only professional work and expertise are the top priorities of every student, in order to lure young people to bury themselves in professional work, separate from reality, separate from class struggle, not to highlight politics, and not to use politics to command professional work. Kuang Yaming's intentions are very sinister. He uses metaphors and subtly and viciously attacks the "red" proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao as a dry "slogan," that is, to say that politics, world outlook, and ideological transformation are a kind of illusory fantasy.
    Kuang Yaming's "three-seven split between red and expert" is a black flag that thoroughly opposes Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without correct political views, it is as if there is no soul." Politics is the soul, and we must use red to guide expert, use politics to command professional work, and ideological transformation and world outlook transformation are a matter of a lifetime. Kuang Yaming completely goes against this. He uses the guise of so-called using "three-tenths of our energy to establish a world outlook" to oppose highlighting politics and oppose implementing red in the ideological revolutionization of people. He raises the so-called "expert" and "professional work" to the sky with one hand, and puts "red" and "politics" into the cold palace with the other. He raises the black flag of "three-seven split between red and expert" to openly contend with the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Kuang Yaming's "three-seven split between red and expert" is a black rope that binds the hands and feet of our revolutionary youth from participating in the three major revolutionary movements, and a stumbling block for our educated youth to integrate with the workers and peasants. He advocates study first, professional work first, and asks us not to ask about politics, to drill into the pile of books, to memorize books by rote, and to be isolated from actual struggle. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that the only standard to see if a young person is revolutionary is "whether he is willing and puts it into practice to integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants." We must go to the masses, we must go to the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, and go to the fiery struggle to temper ourselves in the three major revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. However, Kuang Yaming tried every means to use study and professional work to lure our youth, and set up heavy barriers on the road of our youth's integration with the workers and peasants and on the road of the three major revolutions, such as "using three-tenths of our energy to establish a world outlook," "books as the main thing," and "indirect knowledge as the main thing," and built walls to prevent our youth from going to the vigorous revolutionary struggle.
    "Three-seven split between red and expert" is a black flag that thoroughly opposes the Party's education policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. According to his "three-seven split between red and expert," the successors trained will only be bourgeois successors. Imperialism and revisionism dream of our country changing its color, and they place their hopes of "peaceful evolution" on our younger generation. Kuang Yaming's "three-seven split between red and expert" is to adapt to the needs of imperialism and revisionism and serve them. He unscrupulously peddles the black goods of "three-seven split between red and expert" in order to plant the seeds of revisionism in the younger generation, to make us take over the class of the bourgeoisie, take over the class of revisionism, and prepare "talents" for the restoration of capitalism.
    Kuang Yaming, an anti-Party and anti-socialist element who has always been wearing the cloak of a "Marxist" and swindling everywhere, has been revealed in its true form under the searchlight of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has been dragged out by the revolutionary masses to be shown to the public. His black goods of "three-seven split between red and expert" has also lost its market among young people. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of the Party's education policy. We must take advantage of the victory to pursue fiercely, thoroughly uproot Kuang Yaming's black flag of "three-seven split between red and expert," thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionist educational thought he spread, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 彻底拔掉匡亚明“红专三七开”的黑旗

    彻底拔掉匡亚明“红专三七开”的黑旗
    南京大学的反党黑帮头子匡亚明钻进学校以后，就明目张胆地为南京大学制定了一整套资产阶级、修正主义教育路线。三年多来，他全面地篡改了毛泽东教育思想，取消党的教育方针，大肆贩卖修正主义的黑货。
    匡亚明提出的臭名昭著的“红专三七开”公式，就是他狂热地推行资产阶级、修正主义教育路线的标本之一。匡亚明是打着“红旗”反红旗的老手，他在红与专关系问题上，也替自己加上了一层保护色。他推销的“红专三七开”的公式，比之那种赤裸裸的鼓吹走白专道路，更有欺骗性、迷惑性。他的“红专三七开”的谬论，最初是在一九六三年七名高考成绩“最优者”座谈会上粉墨登场的。后来，他又以党委第一书记的身份，把这个黑货兜售到各级组织，并在学校《前进报》上刊登，毒害了不少青年学生。
    在一九六三年七名高考成绩“最优者”座谈会上，他赤膊上阵，肆无忌惮地说：“我们叫喊‘打倒帝国主义’口号，这是红；如何打倒，这是专。学习也要‘三七’开，要把精力放在学习上。要攻击堡垒，就要作艰苦的努力……要用十分之三的精力建立世界观。”
    他叫我们只要用“十分之三的精力建立世界观”，即用在红，用在政治上，而要把“十分之七”的精力用在学习上，即用在专，用在业务上。这就是竭力鼓吹一个人的思想改造、无产阶级世界观的确立，是微不足道的，只有业务和专，才是每个学生的头等大事，以此引诱青年埋头专攻业务，脱离实际，脱离阶级斗争，不要突出政治，不要以政治统帅业务。匡亚明的居心十分险恶，他用比喻手法，含沙射影地恶毒攻击党和毛主席提出的“红”是干巴巴的“口号”，也就是把政治、把世界观和思想改造，说成是一种虚无缥缈的幻影。
    匡亚明的“红专三七开”是一面彻头彻尾的反毛泽东思想的黑旗。毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”政治是灵魂，必须以红指导专，以政治统帅业务，思想改造、世界观的改造是一辈子的事。匡亚明完全反其道而行之。他借所谓用“十分之三的精力建立世界观”的幌子，反对突出政治，反对把红落实到人的思想革命化上。他一手把所谓“专”、“业务”抬高到天上，一手把“红”、“政治”打入冷宫。他打出“红专三七开”的黑旗，就是要公开同毛泽东思想伟大红旗分庭抗礼。
    匡亚明的“红专三七开”，是束缚我们革命青年投入三大革命运动的手脚的黑绳子，是我们知识青年与工农群众相结合的绊脚石。他鼓吹学习至上、业务至上，要我们不问政治，钻进书堆，死啃书本，同实际斗争绝缘。毛主席一再教导我们，看一个青年是不是革命的，“只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中去锻炼。匡亚明却千方百计地用学习、业务引诱我们青年，在我们同工农群众相结合的道路上，在三大革命的道路上，布设下了“用十分之三的精力建立世界观”、“书本为主”、“间接知识为主”等重重关卡，筑起了一道道高墙，阻挠我们青年到轰轰烈烈的革命斗争中去。
    “红专三七开”，是一面彻头彻尾对抗党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的黑旗。按照他的“红专三七开”做去，培养出的接班人，只能是资产阶级的接班人。帝国主义和修正主义梦想我们国家改变颜色，他们把“和平演变”的希望寄托在我们青年一代的身上。匡亚明的“红专三七开”，就是适应帝国主义和修正主义的这种需要，为他们效劳的。他不择手段地大肆兜售“红专三七开”的黑货，就是想在青年一代中栽下修正主义的根苗，要我们接资产阶级的班，接修正主义的班，为资本主义复辟准备“人材”。
    一向披着“马克思主义者”外衣，到处招摇撞骗的反党反社会主义分子匡亚明，已经在无产阶级文化大革命的照妖镜下现出了原形，被革命群众揪出来示众了，他的“红专三七开”黑货也就随之在青年中失掉了市场。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是党的教育方针的伟大胜利。我们一定要乘胜猛追，彻底拔掉匡亚明的“红专三七开”黑旗，彻底消除他散布的修正主义教育思想毒素，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
