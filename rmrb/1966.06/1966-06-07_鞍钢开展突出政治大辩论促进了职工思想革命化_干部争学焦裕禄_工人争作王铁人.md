    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Carries Out Prominent Political Debate to Promote the Ideological Revolutionization of Employees
    Cadres Strive to Learn from Jiao Yulu, Workers Strive to Become Wang Tie
    A new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works creatively and a great political situation of grasping the “four firsts” has emerged throughout the enterprise. All employees strive to thoroughly realize the revolutionization of the enterprise and turn Anshan Iron and Steel Company into a Daqing-style enterprise.
    Editor's Note: Since Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched a prominent political debate, the class consciousness of the broad masses of employees has been further enhanced, and their revolutionary spirit has been further invigorated. A new situation has emerged in which cadres strive to learn from Jiao Yulu and workers strive to become Wang Tie.
    Chairman Mao said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." The human factor is the most important. Products must be produced and manufactured by people, and experience must be accumulated and summarized by people. Without the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of employees and without their hard work, nothing can be accomplished. The reason why we emphasize highlighting politics is to solve the problem of people's ideological revolutionization, to make Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds. When people's ideology is revolutionized, everything will be easy to handle.
    The prominent political debate carried out by Anshan Iron and Steel Company is a vivid example of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, with leading cadres taking the lead in revolution and realizing the ideological revolutionization of people and the revolutionization of enterprises.
    The employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have gained many good experiences in carrying out prominent political debates. These experiences, in the final analysis, are to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's subjective world. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. With such people, the proletarian revolution can be carried through to the end and all revolutionary work can be done well. The experience of the prominent political debate carried out by Anshan Iron and Steel Company fully proves this point.
    (Dispatch from Anshan, June 6th, our newspaper) Following the spirit of the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference held at the beginning of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, focusing on how to highlight politics and how to run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, launched a mass inspection and debate that lasted for two months. Great changes have taken place in the mental outlook of employees and the production outlook of the enterprise.
    This debate has promoted the ideological revolutionization of cadres and employees and invigorated people's revolutionary spirit. The broad masses of cadres and employees have developed a strong desire to transform themselves. Many leading cadres of factories and mines can no longer sit still. They feel that they can no longer fail to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works creatively, they can no longer fail to transform their world outlook and ideological style, they can no longer fail to squat down, go deep into reality, and contact the masses, and they can no longer fail to make up their minds to catch up with Daqing. The revolutionary spirit of the masses has been further invigorated. They said, "If the leaders learn from Jiao Yulu, we will be the people of Lankao; if the enterprise catches up with Daqing, we will be Wang Tie."
    Through debate, the political and ideological work of the enterprise has been greatly invigorated, and a new upsurge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and a great political situation of grasping the "four firsts" has begun to emerge.
    Through debate, spirit has been transformed into matter, powerfully promoting production and the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. The production in the first quarter achieved a "flying start", and the output of many factories and mines in March reached the highest record in history. The output of major products in the entire quarter exceeded the plan, and the steel output exceeded the production level of the fourth quarter of last year. The quality of key products has also been significantly improved. The movement of technological innovation and technological revolution has made new progress, and many major innovation projects have emerged. The actual recovery rate of flotation of red iron ore increased from 80 percent last year to 85 percent, reaching the most advanced level.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company has six main experiences in carrying out prominent political debates.
    According to the path pointed out by Chairman Mao for running enterprises, inspect and summarize experiences and lessons
    In this debate, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee first conducted repeated theoretical discussions and inspections, and summarized the basic experiences and lessons learned from studying the People's Liberation Army and Daqing in the past two years, dividing them into two. In the past two years, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's work has made great progress and development, but compared with the People's Liberation Army and Daqing, there is still a considerable gap. There are thousands of gaps, but the most fundamental one is that the highlighting of politics is not enough, and the fundamental problem of running Anshan Iron and Steel Company well according to Mao Zedong Thought has not been completely solved. Why is there still a gap after two years of study? This is because there are still many erroneous ideas within Anshan Iron and Steel Company that are incompatible with Mao Zedong Thought, and there are still influences from foreign erroneous ideas and old habits. Many cadres still have erroneous views of neglecting class struggle and neglecting politics. According to Chairman Mao's consistent teachings on running socialist enterprises well, and in light of the actual situation of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee realized from the summary that in order to catch up with Daqing, it must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, break down and establish on a large scale, and focus on solving four ideological problems. This is: break the view of neglecting politics and purely focusing on technology and business, establish the idea of politics commanding technology and business, and politics commanding everything; break the idea of "control" as the top priority, relying solely on rules and regulations, not believing in the masses, and not relying on the masses, establish the idea of believing in the masses and launching mass movements; break all kinds of metaphysical ideas in enterprise management, establish the idea of dialectical materialism; break the idea of being divorced from reality and not serving users, and establish the idea of linking with reality and taking user satisfaction as the high standard for testing their own production practice. The first issue is the most important of these four. Solving these four problems is essentially a struggle between two paths of whether to run an enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee is determined to grasp this "one prominence" (highlighting politics), "four ideas", and adhere to implementing it throughout the year's work.
    The Party Committee's summary report was thoroughly discussed at a cadre meeting of 5,000 people. The leaders of various factories, mines, and workshops also initially inspected and summarized the experiences and lessons of their units, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, and conveyed the spirit of the 5,000-person meeting to the employees in light of reality. The broad masses of cadres and employees reflected: "This summary solves problems, Mao Zedong Thought is held high, practical problems are closely linked, and the key to Anshan Iron and Steel Company is grasped." Everyone felt that this summary was very kind and practical, raising many practical problems existing in the enterprise and linking them with Mao Zedong Thought, raising awareness, and clarifying the direction.
    Boldly mobilize the masses and uncover the lid of not highlighting politics
    In order to make the "four ideas" proposed by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and known to every household, the prominent political debate with the "four ideas" as the main content was taken as the first central task of Anshan Iron and Steel Company after the 5,000-person cadre meeting. First of all, the masses were boldly mobilized to carry out great airing of views and debates. Whether cadres, workers, or technical and functional personnel, everyone participated, everyone spoke, presented facts, expressed ideas, and uncovered the lid of not highlighting politics in the enterprise. The great airing of views and debates mainly uncovered two types of lids: first, the manifestations of not highlighting politics in the enterprise; then, digging into ideas and uncovering the ideological lid.
    After the great airing of views and debates, many erroneous tendencies and erroneous ideas were exposed, which not only provided materials for the debate and established the opposite, but more importantly, the problem presentation itself was a vivid education in highlighting politics. Many comrades, especially leading cadres, were greatly shocked and felt that "if we don't highlight politics again, we will lead the enterprise onto the evil road of revisionism." Many people painfully realized that "it is time to solve the problem of highlighting politics."
    The great debate must be based on the "outline" of Mao Zedong Thought and the "outline" of class struggle and the struggle between two roads
    The debate did not deal with matters on a case-by-case basis, circling around trivial issues, business and technical issues, but guided the masses to raise their understanding of problems and analyze problems to the height of Mao Zedong Thought and to the height of class struggle and the struggle between two roads. When the ideology is based on the "outline", it stands high and sees far, hits the nail on the head, making the debate ideological and convincing, and truly able to open up people's minds. The debate on how to deal with user refusals in the Finance and Accounting Department of the company illustrates this point. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company sent a kind of boiler steel plate to users, which was not calculated according to the newly reduced price, but according to the old price of last year, so some users proposed to refuse to pay. In the debate on this issue, some comrades believed that this was a purely business issue, a specific error in pricing, and there was nothing remarkable about it. When discussing how to deal with this problem, some comrades were afraid of trouble and advocated reducing prices for users who refused to pay, and letting the mistake go for users who did not raise it. In this way, the cost department argued back and forth without reaching a conclusion. Later, the entire department debated this issue, and the leaders raised the issue of "the mistake lies in the price, and the root lies in the ideology", requiring the problem to be analyzed from the "outline". After repeated theoretical discussions, everyone unanimously realized that this was not a small problem, but a struggle between two roads of capitalist management ideology and socialist management ideology. Socialist enterprises should have a high sense of responsibility to users, and unreasonable money, even if it is a penny, should not be earned. In this way, everyone had a clear line between right and wrong in their minds and understood how to use political principles to handle business issues. They decided to investigate all the accounts this year, find all the users who ordered this kind of steel plate, and take the initiative to return the overcharged payment. After three days and three nights of hard work, they finally found 44 users from thousands of accounts and returned 220,000 yuan, which they exchanged for socialist management ideology. This debate gave the accounting staff a profound education and made them realize the great significance of highlighting politics.
    There are many similar debates.
    The most fundamental way to get on the "outline" is to organize employees to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. When the debate was "stuck", the masses were mobilized to find answers in Chairman Mao's works. For example, some workers in the medium plate factory were often transferred to different positions. Although they obeyed the assignment, their wages did not increase as quickly as in their original positions, so they put forward the argument that "highlighting politics is a loss." This argument resonated and sympathized with low-wage comrades at the beginning of the debate. Later, everyone was organized to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and learn how Zhang Side served the people. The comrade who originally thought it was a "loss" became enlightened. He refuted his own "loss theory" at the meeting. He said: Whether it is a loss or not depends on where you stand. If you stand on the position of personal interests, of course it is a "loss"; but if you stand on the position of serving the people wholeheartedly like Zhang Side, it is not a loss, but greatly beneficial to the people. Once he got on this "outline", he not only solved the problem correctly, but also gave the comrades present a vivid lesson.
    The practice of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the great debate proves that organizing employees to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the problems in the debate, so that the problems in the debate are based on the "outline" of Mao Zedong Thought and the "outline" of class struggle and the struggle between two roads, is a fundamental key to highlighting politics in the debate.
    Grasp living ideas and organize living debates
    The debate should emphasize the integration of theory with practice, grasp all kinds of living people, living things, living models, and living topics, and explain an idea and clarify a principle through vivid and lively debates to solve various living ideas that actually exist. This method of debate runs through the spirit of the first priority of living ideas, and educates and persuades people through living facts. To sum up, the main methods are: to deepen the understanding of highlighting politics by summarizing one or two pieces of work and analyzing the reasons for success or failure; to study and discuss the actual problems of current work, and to carry out education through the practice of highlighting politics; to grasp the representative living topics put forward by the masses themselves and organize relevant personnel to start a debate; to grasp a bad thing and carry out education, turning bad things into good things for highlighting politics, or using both positive and negative mirrors to carry out vivid comparative education; to help a backward person or a person with erroneous views change their understanding through class education methods and meticulous ideological work, and then let them speak from their own experiences to the masses; to promote positive factors and establish positive models of highlighting politics, so that people have role models to learn from.
    Leaders take the lead in revolution, inspire everyone to consciously revolutionize, and promote the ideological revolutionization of people
    Every problem in the enterprise that does not highlight politics is related to people's thinking. Therefore, every unit not only paid attention to solving the problem of why it is necessary to highlight politics in the great debate, but also grasped the essence through phenomena, followed the clues, and solved the ideological problem of why there is no highlighting of politics. The method of leaders taking the lead in revolution and inspiring everyone to consciously revolutionize was adopted to conscientiously carry out the transformation of the world outlook.
    Among leading cadres, the method of small rectification was adopted. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, Comrade Jiao Yulu was taken as a mirror to check themselves, attract fire to themselves, listen to mass criticism, and focus on inspecting and criticizing the middling thought of not being energetic in revolutionary spirit, being satisfied with the status quo, and not seeking progress, and replace the word "middle" with the word "surpass." Many people checked their lack of revolutionary lofty ideals and their fear of taking the lead and going too far. Such as: "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault," "fear of trouble, fear of getting involved," "can only learn, cannot surpass," "watching the stall and guarding the business, losing money year after year, feeling at ease," and so on. Some cadres checked that five "lazy" characters had grown in their minds: lazy eyes, not reading Chairman's books; lazy brains, not thinking about problems; lazy mouths, not doing ideological work; lazy legs, not going deep into the grassroots; lazy hands, not participating in labor, and not doing work themselves. These comrades conscientiously made self-criticism and expressed that they would take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, eliminate selfish thoughts and distractions, and wholeheartedly serve the revolution. Some said: "In order to surpass Daqing and create the world's first-class, I want to take creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as a lifelong combat task, do revolution for a lifetime, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, and transform my thinking for a lifetime." Some expressed that they would resolutely be a thorough revolutionary and never be a half-baked revolutionary. Many leading cadres of units went down to squat down, investigate and study, and tackle key problems and conduct experiments with the masses.
    Among the working masses, the method of class education by recalling comparisons was mainly adopted to inspire consciousness, speak from personal experience, and educate themselves, focusing on solving the problem of working for whom.
    Among technical personnel, the main emphasis was on vigorously publicizing the Party's policy towards intellectuals, advocating open-mindedness and free-hearted talks, and focusing on solving the relationship between being red and being expert. After the debate, most of them spoke their minds and expressed their feelings, and found the root cause of not highlighting politics from ideological understanding and class stand, and expressed their willingness to take the road of revolutionizing and laborizing and carry out the transformation of rebirth.
    Although all kinds of personnel have different ideological problems and different degrees, the fundamental problem is the struggle between two worldviews and outlooks on life. If the debate does not grasp this essential problem and does not open a gap from the root, highlighting politics cannot truly take root in people's minds, but only stays at the stage of general understanding.
    Grasp the three major revolutions together, and combine the prominent political debate with the current work of the enterprise
    When deploying this year's work at the 5,000-person cadre meeting, Anshan Iron and Steel Company put forward "holding higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting politics, learning from the People's Liberation Army, learning from Daqing, thoroughly realizing the revolutionization of the enterprise, and catching up with the most advanced levels at home and abroad" as the action slogan for the year's work. The overall goal is to turn Anshan Iron and Steel Company into a Daqing-style enterprise. The first priority here is to highlight politics, so that people's thinking is revolutionized and the enterprise is revolutionized. With Daqing people, there will be Daqing-style enterprises. On the basis of the ideological revolutionization of employees, the overall goal must be achieved. While organizing the great debate, all grassroots units generally mobilized the masses to find information, determine the opponents to catch up with, find the gaps, conduct investigations and studies, and formulate their own catch-up plans and measures, focusing on the company's overall goals. In the later stage of the debate, cadres and employees were organized to repeatedly discuss and implement, and the major key problems in catching up were put forward and discussed with the masses. Many problems that were considered "old and difficult" in the past, which required reaching out to the state for funds and equipment to solve, were found through everyone's discussion and solved independently. Some factories planned to spend millions of yuan on technical measures this year, but this time they cut it in half. Some projects that had to wait until the end of the year or the year after next, this time they did not wait and solved it themselves. Through the prominent political debate, many cadres saw the infinite creativity hidden in the broad masses, and the masses also enhanced their ambition to catch up with the world's most advanced levels from the continuous revolutionization of the leaders.

    鞍钢开展突出政治大辩论促进了职工思想革命化
    干部争学焦裕禄　工人争作王铁人
    整个企业出现活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮和狠抓“四个第一”的大好政治局面。全体职工力争彻底实现企业革命化，把鞍钢办成大庆式企业
    编者按：鞍山钢铁公司开展突出政治大辩论以来，广大职工的阶级觉悟更加提高，革命精神更加振奋，出现了一个干部争学焦裕禄、工人争作王铁人的新局面。
    毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”人的因素第一。产品要由人来生产和制造，经验要由人来积累和总结；离开了广大职工群众的社会主义觉悟，离开了广大职工群众的辛勤劳动，什么事情都办不成。我们所以强调突出政治，就是要解决人的思想革命化的问题，就是要使毛泽东思想在我们头脑里扎根。人的思想革命化了，一切事情就好办了。
    鞍钢开展突出政治的大辩论，是活学活用毛泽东思想，领导干部率先革命，实现人的思想革命化，实现企业革命化的一个生动的事例。
    鞍钢职工开展突出政治大辩论，取得了许多好经验。这些经验，归根到底，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想改造人们的主观世界。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，有了这样的人，就能把无产阶级革命进行到底，把一切革命工作做好。鞍钢开展的突出政治大辩论的经验充分地证明了这一点。
    本报鞍山六日电　鞍山钢铁公司根据今年年初召开的全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议精神，围绕如何突出政治、如何按毛泽东思想办企业的问题，开展了一场历时两月的群众性的大检查、大辩论之后，职工精神面貌和企业生产面貌都发生了很大的变化。
    通过这场大辩论，促进了干部和职工的思想革命化，振奋了人们的革命精神。广大干部和职工产生了改造自己的强烈愿望。许多厂矿的领导干部都坐不住了。他们感到：自己再不好好活学活用毛主席著作不行了，再不改造自己的世界观和思想作风不行了，再不去蹲点、深入实际、联系群众不行了，再不下决心赶超大庆不行了。群众的革命精神更加振奋。他们说：“领导学习焦裕禄，我们就作兰考人；企业赶超大庆，我们就当王铁人。”
    通过辩论，企业的政治思想工作大大活跃起来了，开始出现了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮和狠抓“四个第一”的大好政治局面。
    通过辩论，精神变物质，有力地推动了生产和技术革新与技术革命运动。第一季度的生产实现了“开门红”，三月份有许多厂矿的产量出现了历史最高纪录。全季主要产品产量，都超额完成了计划，钢产量超过了去年第四季度的生产水平。重点产品的质量也有较大幅度的提高。技术革新技术革命运动有了新的发展，出现了很多重大的革新项目。红铁矿浮选实收率由去年的百分之八十上升到百分之八十五，达到了最先进的水平。
    鞍钢职工开展突出政治大辩论的主要经验有六条。
    按照毛主席指出的办企业的道路，检查和总结经验教训
    在这场大辩论中，鞍钢党委首先进行反复务虚和检查，一分为二地总结了两年来学习解放军、学习大庆的基本经验教训。这两年，鞍钢的工作有了很大的进步和发展，但是同解放军和大庆相比，还有相当大的差距。差距有千万条，但是最根本的一条是突出政治不够，按毛泽东思想办好鞍钢的根本问题没有完全解决。为什么学习了两年，还存在着差距呢？这是因为鞍钢内部还存在着同毛泽东思想格格不入的许多错误思想，存在着外国错误思想影响和旧的习惯势力。不少干部还存在着忽视阶级斗争、忽视政治的错误观点。根据毛主席关于办好社会主义企业的一贯教导，对照鞍钢的实际情况，鞍钢党委从总结中认识到，要赶超大庆，必须高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，大破大立，集中解决四个思想认识问题，这就是：破忽视政治、单纯技术业务的观点，立政治统帅技术业务、政治统帅一切的思想；破“管”字当头、单纯依靠规章制度、不相信群众、不依靠群众的思想，立相信群众、大搞群众运动的思想；破企业管理中的各种形而上学思想，立唯物辩证法思想；破脱离实际，不为用户服务的思想，立联系实际，以用户满意作为检验自己生产实践的高标准思想。这四个问题，最重要的是第一个问题。解决这四个问题，实质上是一场是否按毛泽东思想办企业的两条道路的斗争。因此，鞍钢党委决心抓住这“一个突出”（突出政治），“四个思想”，在全年的工作中坚持贯彻到底。
    党委的总结报告，在五千人的干部大会上进行了深入讨论。各个厂矿和车间领导，也都以毛泽东思想为指针，初步检查和总结了本单位的经验教训，联系实际，向职工传达五千人大会的精神。广大干部和职工反映：“这样的总结解决问题，毛泽东思想举得高，实际问题扣得紧，牵到了鞍钢的牛鼻子。”大家感到，这样总结，很亲切，很实在，把企业中存在的许多实际问题，提高起来，同毛泽东思想挂上了钩，提高了认识，明确了方向。
    放手发动群众，大揭不突出政治的盖子
    为了使鞍钢党委提出的“四个思想”深入人心，家喻户晓，在五千人干部大会以后，以“四个思想”为主要内容的突出政治的大辩论作为鞍钢的第一项中心工作来抓。首先放手发动群众，开展了大鸣大放。无论是干部、工人，还是技术和职能人员，人人参加，人人发言，摆事实，亮思想，大揭企业里不突出政治的盖子。大鸣大放，主要是揭了两种盖子：先揭企业里不突出政治的表现；进而挖思想，揭开思想盖子。
    经过大鸣大放，暴露出许许多多的错误倾向和错误思想，不仅为大辩论提供了材料，树立了对立面，更重要的是摆问题本身就是一场突出政治的生动教育。不少同志，特别是领导干部大吃一惊，感到“再不突出政治，就要把企业引向修正主义的邪路上去了”。许多人痛心疾首，认识到“是该解决突出政治问题的时候了”。
    大辩论一定要上毛泽东思想的“纲”，上阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的“纲”
    辩论时不是就事论事，在枝节问题、业务技术问题上打圈子，而是引导群众提高到毛泽东思想的高度，提高到阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的高度来认识问题、分析问题。思想上了“纲”，就站得高，看得远，一针见血，使辩论具有思想性和说服力，真正能打通人们的思想。公司财会处辩论如何处理用户拒付的情况，就说明了这个问题。鞍钢公司今年发给用户一种锅炉钢板，没有按照新降的价格计算，而是按照去年的老价计算，因此有的用户提出来拒付。在辩论这个问题时，有的同志认为这是一个单纯业务问题，是计价上的具体差错，没有什么了不起。在讨论如何处理这一问题时，有的同志怕麻烦，主张对提出拒付的用户实行降价，对未提出的用户将错就错。这样在成本科争来争去，得不出结论。后来全处对这个问题进行了辩论，领导提出了“错在价格，根在思想”的问题，要求把问题提高到“纲”上来分析。经过反复务虚，一致认识到这不是一个小问题，而是一个资本主义经营思想与社会主义经营思想的两条道路的斗争问题。社会主义企业，应该有对用户负责的高度责任感，不合理的钱，那怕是一分钱，也不应该赚。这样，大家脑子里就有了一个明确的是非界限，懂得了怎样用政治原则来处理业务问题了。他们决定清查今年的所有账目，把订这种钢板的用户统统找出来，主动退回多收的货款。经过了三天三夜的努力，他们终于从成千笔的账目中，查出了四十四个用户，退还了二十二万元，用它换回了社会主义的经营思想。这次辩论，给了财会人员以深刻的教育，使他们体会到了突出政治的重大意义。
    类似这样的辩论还有很多。
    上“纲”的最根本办法，就是组织职工活学活用毛主席著作。当辩论“卡壳”的时候，就发动群众到毛主席著作中去找答案。如中板厂有的工人因岗位经常调动，自己服从了分配，结果工资反而没有原岗位增加得快，因此提出了“突出政治吃亏”的论点。这个论点，在开始辩论时，得到了低工资同志的共鸣和同情。后来组织了大家学习“老三篇”，学习了张思德是怎样为人民服务的，这个原来认为“吃亏”的同志觉悟了。他在会上，自己就驳倒了自己的“吃亏论”。他说：吃亏不吃亏，看你站在什么立场。如果站在个人利益的立场上，当然是“吃亏了”；但是如果站在象张思德那样彻底为人民服务的立场上，就不是吃亏，而是对人民大有益处。他这样一上“纲”，不但正确解决了问题，而且给到会同志上了生动的一课。
    鞍钢在大辩论中的实践证明：组织职工带着辩论中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，使辩论的问题上了毛泽东思想的“纲”，上了阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的“纲”，是在辩论中突出政治的一个根本关键。
    大抓活思想，组织活的辩论
    辩论要强调理论联系实际，抓各种活人、活事、活典型、活题目，通过生动活泼的辩论，说明一个思想，讲清一个道理，去解决实际存在的各种活思想。这种辩论的方法，贯串了活的思想第一的精神，通过活生生的事实去教育人，说服人。归纳起来，主要办法有：通过总结一件或两件工作，分析成败的原因，加深对突出政治的认识；抓住当前工作的实际问题，加以研究讨论，通过突出政治的实践，进行教育；抓住群众自己提出来的有代表性的活题目，组织有关人员展开辩论；抓住一件坏事，进行教育，把坏事变成突出政治的好事，或者用正反两面镜子，进行形象对比教育；通过阶级教育的办法及细致的思想工作，帮助一个落后的人或持有错误观点的人，转变认识，再由他们向群众现身说法；发扬积极因素，大树突出政治的正面典型，使人学有榜样。
    领导率先革命，启发大家自觉革命，促进人的思想革命化
    企业里每一件不突出政治的问题，都和人的思想有联系。所以，各个单位在大辩论中不仅注意解决为什么要突出政治的认识问题，而且还透过现象抓住本质，顺蔓摸瓜，解决为什么没有突出政治的思想问题。采取领导带头革命，启发大家自觉革命的办法，认真进行世界观的改造。
    在领导干部中，采取了小整风的方法，以毛泽东思想为武器，把焦裕禄同志作为镜子，对照检查自己，引火烧身，听取群众批评，集中地检查和批判革命精神不振，满足现状，不求上进的中游思想，把“中”字换成“超”字。许多人检查了缺乏革命的远大理想，怕抢了先，过了头的思想。诸如：“不求有功，但求无过”，“怕出乱子，怕沾包”，“只能学，不能超”，“看摊守业，连年亏损，心安理得”等等。有的干部检查，思想上滋长了五个“懒”字：眼睛懒，不读主席书；脑子懒，不想问题；嘴巴懒，不作思想工作；腿脚懒，不深入基层；手懒，不爱参加劳动，工作不亲自动手。这些同志认真地作了自我批评，纷纷表示，要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，清除私心杂念，一心为革命。有的说：“为了超大庆，创造世界第一流，我要把活学活用毛主席著作当作毕生的战斗任务，干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想。”有的表示，坚决作一个彻底的革命者，决不作半截子革命家。许多单位的领导干部下去蹲点，调查研究，同群众一块攻关键，搞试验。
    在工人群众中，主要采取回忆对比的阶级教育的办法，启发自觉，现身说法，自己教育自己，集中地解决为谁劳动的问题。
    在技职人员中，主要是大力宣传党对知识分子的政策，提倡敞开思想，自由谈心，集中地解决红与专的关系问题。经过辩论，他们大都说了思想话，交了心，从思想认识和阶级立场上找到了不突出政治的根源，纷纷表示走革命化劳动化道路，进行脱胎换骨的改造。
    尽管各类人员有不同的思想问题，程度也各有不同，但归根到底是两种世界观、人生观的斗争问题。如果辩论中不抓住这个本质问题，不从根子上打开一个缺口，突出政治就不能真正在人的思想上扎根，而只停留在一般认识的阶段。
    三大革命一齐抓，把突出政治的大辩论同当前企业的各项工作结合进行
    鞍钢在五千人干部大会部署今年工作时，提出“更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，大学解放军，大学大庆，彻底实现企业革命化，赶超国内外最先进水平”，作为全年工作的行动口号，总的目标是要把鞍钢办成大庆式企业。这里首先是突出政治，做到人的思想革命化，企业的革命化。有了大庆人，才有大庆式企业。要在职工思想革命化的基础上，实现总的目标。各个基层单位在组织大辩论的同时，普遍围绕公司总的奋斗目标，发动群众查找资料，确定赶超的对手，找了差距，进行调查研究，拟订了自己的赶超规划和措施。在辩论后期，又组织干部职工反复讨论落实，把赶超当中的重大关键问题，摆出来，拿到群众中去讨论。许多过去认为是“老大难”的问题，是需要伸手向国家要资金要设备才能解决的问题，经过大家讨论，找到了办法，自力更生地解决了。有的厂子今年技术措施计划要花几百万元，这回砍去了一半。有的要等到年底或明后年才能排上号的项目，这回他们不等了，自己动手解决。通过突出政治大辩论，许多干部看到了蕴藏在广大群众中的无限创造力，群众也从领导不断革命化的过程中增强了赶超世界最先进水平的雄心壮志。
