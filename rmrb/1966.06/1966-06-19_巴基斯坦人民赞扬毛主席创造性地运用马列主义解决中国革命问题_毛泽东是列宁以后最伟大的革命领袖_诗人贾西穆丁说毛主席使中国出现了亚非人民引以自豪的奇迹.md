    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 16th. People from all walks of life in Pakistan love Chairman Mao's works. They praise Chairman Mao as the greatest revolutionary thinker, the great leader not only of the Chinese people, but also of the Asian and African people.
    A teacher at the Lahore Islamic College, when talking about his impressions of reading Chairman Mao's works, said that Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary thinker after Lenin. His creative application of Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution is a model. Chairman Mao's works explain the complex and profound problems of the Chinese revolution in plain and easy-to-understand language, vividly and thoroughly. This is unique in Marxist classics.
    A leader of the Rawalpindi Farmers' Association said that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the Asian and African people. His works were written to solve the problems of China, and also for other oppressed countries in Asia and Africa.
    A Pakistani military officer said that Chairman Mao is a great politician and a great military strategist. He said that Chairman Mao's military writings are masterpieces. In particular, his discussion of guerrilla warfare is still correct in all respects.
    Chairman Mao Zedong enjoys high prestige among the Pakistani people. A taxi driver, upon hearing that the Chinese veterinary delegation riding in his car had come from China, said: "Don't say China, say great China, Mao Zedong's China."
    The strong desire of the Pakistani people to study Chairman Mao's works was clearly demonstrated at the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, in March and April this year. Chairman Mao's works were the most popular among the visitors at the exhibition. Many people waited for several hours in front of the crowded sales department of the exhibition to buy Chairman Mao's works. The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" were sold out in the first three days of the exhibition. Those who could not buy them waited in front of the exhibition window, unwilling to leave. They asked the staff of the exhibition to sell them the exhibited works of Chairman Mao after the exhibition.
    A clerk at a bookstore in Lahore that sells Chinese literature said that every time a new batch of Chairman Mao's works arrives, they are quickly sold out.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 16th. The famous Bengali poet of Pakistan, Jasimuddin, said to a reporter of this agency here on the 16th that the achievements China has made in socialist construction are unprecedented initiatives in the contemporary world. "Here we must mention the great name of Mao Zedong. It is he who has guided the Chinese people to one victory after another."
    Jasimuddin recently visited China as a member of the Pakistani writers' delegation. He said: "The tremendous achievements the Chinese people have made in a short period of about sixteen years are unique in human history."
    He said: "What is happening in China is a glorious miracle, a miracle that Asian and African people take pride in." He pointed out that the rise of the new China has brought new hope to the Asian and African people who are fighting for independence and freedom.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 17th. The famous Pakistani singer, Mrs. Firdousi, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter here on the 17th that the increasingly powerful new China and its firm support for the oppressed people of the world will frustrate all the vicious conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and neo-colonialism.
    Mrs. Firdousi visited China in March this year with the Pakistani Cultural Troupe. She said that the amazing progress made by the Chinese people in all aspects has inspired the people who are fighting for freedom and independence.
    She said that the Chinese people have a high level of political consciousness. Almost everyone knows that he is working for the people and the country, not for money. She said: "I think this is the secret that enables China to achieve so much in such a short period of time."
    Mrs. Firdousi said that equal rights for men and women have become a reality in China. She said: "Wherever we went, we saw women working just like men. This shows that there is complete equality between men and women in Chinese society." (Attached picture)

    诗人贾西穆丁说毛主席使中国出现了亚非人民引以自豪的奇迹
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十六日电　巴基斯坦各界人士热爱毛泽东主席的著作，他们赞扬毛主席是最伟大的革命思想家，不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是亚非人民的伟大领袖。
    拉合尔伊斯兰学院的一位教师谈到他读毛主席著作的感想时说，毛泽东是继列宁之后的最伟大的革命思想家。他创造性地运用马克思列宁主义来解决中国革命问题，这是一个典范。毛主席著作以通俗易懂的语言，生动透彻地阐明了中国革命的复杂和深刻的各项问题。这在马克思主义经典著作中是独一无二的。
    拉瓦尔品第农民协会的一位领导人说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是亚非人民的伟大领袖。他的著作是为解决中国的问题而写的，也是为亚非其他被压迫国家而写的。
    一位巴基斯坦军官说，毛主席是一位伟大的政治家，也是一位伟大的军事家。他说，毛主席的军事著作是杰作。特别是他关于游击战的论述，直到现在在各方面都是正确的。
    毛泽东主席在巴基斯坦人民中间享有崇高的威信。一个出租汽车司机在听到乘坐他的汽车的中国兽医代表团说他们是从中国前来访问的时候说：“不要说中国，要说伟大的中国，毛泽东的中国。”
    巴基斯坦人民学习毛主席著作的强烈愿望，在今年三、四月间在巴基斯坦最大的城市卡拉奇举行的中国经济和贸易展览会上明显地表现出来。毛主席著作在展览会上是观众最喜爱的。许多人为了买毛主席著作，在展览会的拥挤的售卖部前等了好几个钟头。《毛泽东选集》和《毛泽东军事文选》在展览会的头三天就全部售光。买不到的人一直等在展览会橱窗前，舍不得离开。他们要求展览会的工作人员在展览会结束后把这些展出的毛主席著作卖给他们。
    拉合尔一家出售中国文献的书店的店员说，每次新到一批毛主席著作，很快就卖完了。
    新华社达卡十六日电　巴基斯坦著名的孟加拉语诗人贾西穆丁十六日在这里对本社记者发表谈话说，中国在社会主义建设方面所取得的成就，是当代举世无双的创举。“在这里我们必须提到毛泽东这个伟大的名字。正是他引导中国人民取得了一个又一个的胜利。”
    贾西穆丁最近曾以巴基斯坦作家代表团团员的身份访问过中国。他说：“中国人民在短短的大约十六年中所取得的巨大成就，是人类有史以来独一无二的。”
    他说：“在中国出现的事情是一个光辉的奇迹，这是亚非人民引以自豪的一个奇迹。”他指出，新中国的兴起，为正在争取独立和自由而斗争的亚非人民带来了新的希望。
    新华社达卡十七日电　巴基斯坦著名歌唱家菲尔多西夫人十七日在这里对新华社记者发表谈话说，日益强大的新中国以及它对世界被压迫人民的坚决支持，将挫败帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一切恶毒的阴谋鬼计。
    菲尔多西夫人曾在今年三月随同巴基斯坦文工团访问过中国。她说，中国人民在各方面所取得的惊人进展，鼓舞了正在为争取自由和独立而斗争的人民。
    她说，中国人民的政治觉悟很高。几乎每个人都知道，他是在为人民和国家而工作，不是为钱而工作。她说：“我认为，这就是使中国能够在一个很短的时期内取得这么大成就的秘密。”
    菲尔多西夫人说，男女享有平等权利在中国已经成为现实。她说：“在我们所到之处，我们看到妇女就象男人一样地在工作。这表明，在中国社会里，男女之间是完全平等的。”（附图片）
