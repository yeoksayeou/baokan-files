    We, all the students, resolutely stand with Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the force of a thunderbolt, we will sweep away all the monsters and demons, strike straight at the "Three-Family Village," destroy the counter-revolutionary cultural fortress, and seize back the leadership of culture. Whether they are openly resisting or have gone underground, no matter how high their "status" or how great their "authority," as long as they are anti-Party and anti-socialist, as long as they oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely wipe them out!

    再接再厉乘胜追击
    我们全体同学，坚决和聂元梓等同志站在一起，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，以雷霆万钧之势，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，直捣“三家村”，摧毁反革命文化堡垒，夺回文化的领导权。不管是公开顽抗的，还是转入地下的，不管他有多高“地位”，有多大“权威”，只要他们是反党反社会主义的，只要他们是反对毛泽东思想的，我们就要坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们肃清！
              南京师范学院教育系四年级全体同学
