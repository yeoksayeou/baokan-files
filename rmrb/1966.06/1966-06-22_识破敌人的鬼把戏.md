    Expose the Enemy's Tricks
    "Sailing Against the Wind" peddles revisionist black goods, wanting us to be gentle, kind, respectful, thrifty, and yielding to the enemy, not to engage in class struggle, but only to pursue peaceful coexistence.
    In the film, instructor Song Zhigang, knowing that the enemy Deputy Division Commander Zhang Lanshan is feigning illness to deliberately delay time and wait for rescue, not only doesn't wage struggle against the enemy, but compromises and pleads: "This place is desolate and uninhabited, can you walk a few steps ahead to think of a way?" When he gets a stretcher for the enemy Deputy Division Commander and asks the soldiers to carry him, and the soldiers feel surprised and dissatisfied, he uses his authority to shout: "Execute the order." What kind of order is this!? Isn't this an order to suppress ourselves, yield to the enemy, and recognize the thief as our father?
    The enemy Deputy Division Commander says: "I want to eat a chicken." Song says with difficulty: "Where can I buy a chicken?" Then, he begs the enemy: "If we hadn't persuaded and mobilized them, the people wouldn't even give you this (millet rice) to eat!" How kind is the instructor Song in the writer's pen! Truly a "peace angel." He goes on to explain: "...But you know the actual situation, the people have all evacuated, even if we wanted to buy one for you, we couldn't." This is simply a filial son to the enemy, with not a trace of the demeanor of a proletarian army instructor?
    The author of "Sailing Against the Wind" wantonly promotes a policy of surrender and peaceful coexistence with the enemy, attempting to clear the way for capitalist restoration. Let me tell you, writer, the tricks you carefully played have long been seen through by us. We will never allow you to use black films to engage in capitalist restoration. We will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize you, and resolutely denounce the counter-revolutionary crimes of this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements! With the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely be victorious!

    识破敌人的鬼把戏
    《逆风千里》贩卖修正主义的黑货，要我们对敌人温良恭俭让，不搞阶级斗争，只搞和平共处。
    影片里的宋志刚指导员，明知敌副师长张兰山是装病，故意拖延时间，等待援救，他不但不向敌人进行斗争，反而妥协哀求地说：“这里荒无人烟，你能不能走几步到前面想办法？”当他为敌副师长弄来担架，要战士抬，而战士感到意外和不满的时候，他却利用职权喊道：“执行命令。”这是什么命令！？这难道不是压自己、让敌人，认贼作父的命令吗？
    敌副师长说：“我想吃只鸡。”宋为难地说：“哪儿买鸡去？”然后，对敌人求饶：“要不是我们说服动员，老百姓连这个（小米饭）也不给你们吃呀！”编导者笔下的宋指导员是多善良的人啊！真是“和平天使”。他还接着解释：“……可实际情况你们是知道的，老百姓都撤走了，想给你们买都买不到。”这简直是敌人的孝子，哪有一点无产阶级军队指导员的气味？
    《逆风千里》的作者肆意宣扬与敌人和平共处的投降政策，企图为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。告诉你，编导者，你们精心耍的把戏，早已被我们识破了。我们决不允许你们利用黑影片搞资本主义复辟。我们一定更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判你们，坚决讨伐你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的反革命罪行！我们有党中央和毛主席英明、正确的领导，无产阶级文化大革命一定能胜利！
