    Xinhua News Agency, July 7th – Paul Bomani, Head of the Tanzanian Government Economic Delegation, Minister for Economic Affairs and Development Planning, and his wife, hosted a farewell banquet at the Tanzanian Embassy in China this evening.
    Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and his wife, Lin Jiamei, were invited to attend the banquet.
    Minister Bomani and Vice Premier Li Xiannian delivered speeches at the banquet successively. The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.
    In his speech, Minister Bomani praised the victorious struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao against imperialist enslavement. He said that Tanzania had also experienced similar problems. The struggle of African countries against imperialism and colonialism to eliminate political and economic enslavement has not ended.
    Minister Bomani mentioned that the lackeys of imperialism and neo-colonialism still exist, and in essence, economic control and enslavement still exist. Imperialists always try to impose certain conditions on us through "economic aid," and these conditions undermine our personality and dignity. He said that we Asian and African countries should strive to achieve brotherly cooperation in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, and scientific activities.
    Minister Bomani said that the Government of the People's Republic of China has always aided other friendly countries striving for complete independence, the right to live in freedom, and human prosperity, which strengthens the spirit of Asian-African solidarity. Tanzania thanks the Government of the People's Republic of China for the assistance it has given us in our struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism.
    In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the visit of the distinguished Tanzanian guests to our country has achieved complete success. The distinguished Tanzanian guests had cordial and friendly meetings with Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of our country. Through sincere talks between our two sides, we have reached a consensus on further strengthening the friendly cooperative relations between China and Tanzania and on issues of common concern, and we are about to sign a new economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that all of this embodies the sincere desire of the people of China and Tanzania to support each other and cooperate in a friendly manner. Minister Bomani's visit has made a new contribution to further promoting the friendly cooperative relations between our two countries. He also asked the distinguished Tanzanian guests to convey the militant friendship of the Chinese people to the fraternal Tanzanian people.
    Also invited to the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and his wife, as well as responsible persons from relevant departments such as Nan Hanchen, Luo Qingchang, Lei Renmin, Yang Lin, Shen Zijiu, and Yue Songsheng. Tanzanian Ambassador to China, Waziri Juma, and Mrs. Kunambi, Executive Committee Member of the Tanzanian National Women's Federation, attended the banquet.

    新华社七日讯　坦桑尼亚政府经济代表团团长、经济事务和发展计划部长保罗·博马尼和夫人，今晚在坦桑尼亚驻中国大使馆举行告别宴会。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，副总理李先念和夫人林佳楣，应邀出席了宴会。
    博马尼部长和李先念副总理先后在宴会上讲话。宴会上洋溢着热烈友好的气氛。
    博马尼部长在讲话中称赞了中国人民在毛主席领导下进行的反对帝国主义奴役的胜利斗争。他说，坦桑尼亚也有过同样的问题。非洲国家反对帝国主义和殖民主义以消灭政治和经济奴役的斗争，并没有结束。
    博马尼部长谈到，帝国主义和新殖民主义的走狗仍然存在，实质上经济控制和奴役仍然存在。帝国主义者通过“经济援助”总是要把某些附带条件强加在我们身上，这些条件破坏着我们的人格和尊严。他说，我们亚非国家应该在政治、经济、文化和科学活动各方面努力实现兄弟般的合作。
    博马尼部长说，中华人民共和国政府一向援助其他争取完全独立、在自由中生活的人权和人类繁荣的友好国家，这就加强了亚非团结的精神。坦桑尼亚感谢中华人民共和国政府对我们反对帝国主义和新殖民主义的斗争所给予的援助。
    李先念副总理在讲话中说，坦桑尼亚贵宾们这次在我国的访问已经取得了圆满的成功。坦桑尼亚贵宾同刘少奇主席、周恩来总理和我国其他领导人进行了亲切友好的会见。我们双方通过诚挚的会谈，对进一步加强中国和坦桑尼亚之间的友好合作关系和双方共同关心的问题，取得了一致的看法，并且即将签订两国之间新的经济技术合作协定。
    李先念副总理说，所有这些，都体现了中国坦桑尼亚两国人民互相支持、友好合作的真诚愿望。博马尼部长的这次访问，对进一步促进我们两国的友好合作关系，作出了新的贡献。他还请坦桑尼亚贵宾把中国人民的战斗友谊带给兄弟的坦桑尼亚人民。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞和夫人，以及南汉宸、罗青长、雷任民、杨琳、沈兹九、乐松生等有关方面的负责人。坦桑尼亚驻中国大使瓦齐里·朱马，坦桑尼亚全国妇联执委库纳比夫人，出席了宴会。应邀出席宴会的还有非洲一些国家驻中国的使节。
