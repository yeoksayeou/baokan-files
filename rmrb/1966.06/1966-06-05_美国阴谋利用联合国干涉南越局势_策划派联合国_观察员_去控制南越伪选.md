    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from New York: Deeply mired in the quagmire of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson administration on the 2nd played a new trick: advocating that the United Nations send "observers" to "observe" the sham election announced by the South Vietnamese puppet clique in September, attempting to steal the name of the United Nations to "legalize" this "election," and open the door for the United Nations to interfere in Vietnamese affairs, so that the United States can further use the United Nations to serve its aggressive policies, even though the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese issue.
    According to reports, under the planning of the United States, Nguyen Duy Lien, the South Vietnamese puppet clique's "Permanent Observer" to the United Nations, met with UN Secretary-General U Thant on the 2nd, pretending to "inform" U Thant of the South Vietnamese puppet clique's so-called "Constituent Assembly election" to be held in September, and requested U Thant to make arrangements to send "UN observers" to South Vietnam.
    After Nguyen Duy Lien met with U Thant, the U.S. government, which was directing behind the scenes, immediately came to the forefront to express its welcome. After meeting with U.S. President Johnson, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg told reporters that Johnson authorized him to announce: The South Vietnamese puppet clique "invited the United Nations to send observers to the election that South Vietnam is planning to hold, and the President welcomes this action very much." Goldberg also said, "The U.S. government wholeheartedly and completely supports this suggestion," "We think this is a very constructive suggestion."
    Goldberg's hurried statement after Nguyen Duy Lien's meeting with U Thant shows that the United States is eager to realize the sham election held in South Vietnam concocted by the United States, and use the United Nations to get rid of the U.S. predicament in South Vietnam.
    Goldberg also said that he would immediately convey the U.S. government's support to U Thant regarding the sending of "observers" to South Vietnam by the United Nations. He also said that he was confident that U Thant would give the Saigon regime's request "serious consideration." According to a UN spokesperson, U Thant met with the President of the Security Council for this month, New Zealand representative Corner, on the evening of the 2nd to study this issue. Corner said he would consult with the other fourteen members of the Security Council on this issue.

### 美国阴谋利用联合国干涉南越局势  策划派联合国“观察员”去控制南越伪选

    美国阴谋利用联合国干涉南越局势
    策划派联合国“观察员”去控制南越伪选
    据新华社三日讯　纽约消息：在侵越战争的泥潭中越陷越深的约翰逊政府二日玩弄一个新的阴谋：主张联合国派出“观察员”来“观察”南越傀儡集团宣布在九月举行的伪选举，企图盗用联合国的名义来使这个“选举”“合法化”，并且打开联合国干涉越南事务的门路，使美国进一步利用联合国为它的侵略政策服务，尽管联合国根本无权干涉越南问题。
    据报道，在美国的策划下，南越傀儡集团驻联合国“常任观察员”阮维连二日会见了联合国秘书长吴丹，装模作样地把南越傀儡集团将在九月举行所谓“制宪会议的选举”的消息“告诉”吴丹，并且要求吴丹作出安排，派遣“联合国观察员”到南越去。
    在阮维连会见吴丹后，在幕后指挥的美国政府立即跑到前台表示欢迎。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在同美国总统约翰逊会谈后对记者发表谈话说，约翰逊授权他宣布：南越傀儡集团“邀请联合国就南越正在计划进行的选举派出观察员，总统十分欢迎这个行动”。戈德堡还说，“美国政府全心全意地、完全地支持这个建议”，“我们认为这是一个非常建设性的建议”。
    戈德堡在阮维连会见吴丹后就匆匆忙忙发表谈话，说明美国正在急于实现由美国炮制的在南越举行伪选，利用联合国来摆脱美国在南越的困境。
    戈德堡还说，关于由联合国派“观察员”到南越，他将立即向吴丹转达美国政府的支持。他还说，他确信，吴丹会给西贡政权的请求以“认真的考虑”。据联合国发言人宣布，吴丹已在二日晚上会见了本月份的安全理事会主席、新西兰代表科纳，研究这个问题。科纳说，他将同其他十四个安全理事会理事磋商这个问题。
