    New Handicraft Products Supporting Agriculture
    At the National Handicraft Support Agriculture Exhibition, several new products with higher functionality, simpler structure, and easier operation were recently exhibited, arousing great interest among the audience.
    High-Function Feed Crusher
    At the exhibition, a feed crusher with particularly outstanding functions was running every day. The demonstrator fed a bunch of long, dry rice straw into the feed inlet, and in an instant, the machine spit out piles of very fine powder. This feed crusher was created by the Hutang Agricultural Machinery Factory in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province. This feed crusher can crush various dry feeds, processing 100 to 300 jin of feed per hour.
    This feed crusher is driven by a 4.5瓩 electric motor or a 6 to 8 horsepower diesel engine. It is small, easy to load and unload, easy to operate, and has good processing quality, making it suitable for use by rural production brigades.
    Automatic Winnowing Cabinet
    The Dapu Woodware Factory in Liucheng County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has manufactured an automatic winnowing cabinet. This winnowing cabinet does not require electricity, wind power, or human or animal power. It uses the impact force of the grain being winnowed as it falls from the funnel of the winnowing cabinet to drive the blades of the winnowing cabinet to rotate automatically. In this way, rice, sesame, soybeans, corn, etc., can be winnowed even in the absence of electricity, animal power, or wind power. It can winnow 2,500 kg to 3,000 kg of rice per hour. The winnowing cabinet has a moderate speed, uniform wind force, and low cost. The winnowed grain is clean, with very few impurities. Many people have drawn diagrams and are preparing to imitate and promote it.
    Electric Nutrient Pot Machine
    In areas where cotton is sown using nutrient pots, nutrient pots are generally made by hand. The disadvantages of this method are low efficiency, difficulty in pinching the nutrient pots tightly, and laboriousness. Now, the Caidian Town Agricultural Machinery Vehicle Axle Repair and Assembly Cooperative in Hanyang County, Hubei Province, has manufactured an electric nutrient pot machine. Driven by a 2.8瓩 electric motor, it can produce 1,800 nutrient pots per hour, increasing efficiency by more than fifteen times compared to manual pot making. This nutrient pot machine has the characteristics of simple structure and convenient operation. The nutrient pots can be made tight or loose, suitable for the needs of different soil characteristics.
    Double-Cylinder Hand-Pulled Suction Water Wheel
    The Chengguan Woodware Cooperative in Jing County, Anhui Province, has manufactured a double-cylinder hand-pulled suction water wheel. This water wheel frame is equipped with a flywheel. When the flywheel rotates, due to the inertia of the object, the labor intensity is greatly reduced. One person operates one water wheel, driving two suction tanks, saving three laborers compared to the old-fashioned water wheel. Each person can lift 94 tons of water per hour.
    Hand-Cranked Castor Seed Shelling Machine
    Shelling castor seeds by hand is a very tricky job. The Chengguan Wood Industry Cooperative in Nan County, Hunan Province, has successfully manufactured a hand-cranked castor seed shelling machine. One person operates this shelling machine, which can shell more than 20 jin of castor seeds per hour, increasing efficiency by 29 times compared to manual shelling, with a shelling rate of over 95%. This shelling machine is compact, simple in structure, easy to operate, and inexpensive, making it suitable for use everywhere.

    手工业支援农业新产品
    全国手工业支援农业展览会上，最近展出了几种功能较高，结构简单，操作方便的新产品，引起了观众的极大兴趣。
    高功能的饲料粉碎机
    展览会上，一种功能特别突出的饲料粉碎机，每天都在运转。表演员把一把长长的干稻草喂进进料口，一刹那工夫，机器里就吐出一堆堆很细很细的粉末。这种饲料粉碎机是江苏省武进县湖圹农机厂创制的。这种饲料粉碎机能粉碎各种干饲料，每小时可加工饲料一百到三百斤。
    这种饲料粉碎机用四点五瓩电动机或六到八马力的柴油机带动。机体小巧，装卸容易，操作方便，加工质量好，适合农村生产大队使用。
    自动风柜
    广西壮族自治区柳城县大埔木器厂制造了一种自动风柜。这种风柜不用电力、风力或人、畜力，它借助于被风选的谷物从风柜漏斗下落时的冲击力，带动风柜的叶片自动旋转。这样在没有电力、畜力或风力的情况下同样可以风选稻谷、芝麻、黄豆、玉米等，每小时能选稻谷二千五百公斤到三千公斤。风柜转速适度，风力均匀，造价低廉，选出来的谷物干干净净，杂质很少。许多人绘制了图样，准备仿制推广。
    电动制钵机
    采用营养钵播种棉花的地区，一般都是用手工制造营养钵。这种办法的缺点是工效低、营养钵不易捏紧，而且费力。现在湖北省汉阳县蔡甸镇农机车轴修配社制造出一种电动制钵机，用二点八瓩电动机带动，每小时可制营养钵一千八百个，比手工制钵提高工效十五倍以上。这种制钵机具有结构简单，操作方便的特点，制作营养钵时可紧可松，适合不同土壤特点的需要。
    双筒式手拉吸气水车
    安徽省泾县城关木器社制造了一种双筒手拉吸气水车。这种水车车架装有飞轮，飞轮旋转时，由于物体的惯性作用，大大减轻了劳动强度，一架水车一人操作，带动两个吸水槽，比过去老式水车节约三个劳动力，每人每小时可提水九十四吨。
    手摇蓖麻籽脱壳机
    用手工给蓖麻籽脱壳，是一种很棘手的活路。湖南省南县城关木业社制造成功了一种手摇蓖麻籽脱壳机。这种脱壳机一人操作，每小时可脱蓖麻籽二十多斤，比手工脱壳提高工效二十九倍，脱尽率达百分之九十五以上。这种脱壳机机体灵巧，结构简单，操作方便，价格便宜，适合各地使用。
