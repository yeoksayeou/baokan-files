    Among the "Three-Family Village" brothers, Deng Tuo is a traitor who infiltrated the Party, a rightist who slipped through the net, and a vicious enemy of Mao Zedong Thought; Wu Han is a lackey of American imperialism, a running dog of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, and a lackey of a lackey cultivated by the foreign slave Hu Shi. So, who is Liao Mosha?

    During the years of temporary economic difficulties in our country, Liao Mosha, along with his "Three-Family Village" brothers, under the instructions of their big backstage boss, launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. This allowed the broad masses of the people to recognize his reactionary political face. However, because Liao Mosha received the support, protection, and indulgence of his backstage boss, he not only continued to live freely outside the law but even received further trust and important appointments.

    After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao pointed out Liao Mosha's reactionary face, the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee openly resisted the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In July 1964, they deliberately appointed Liao Mosha as the head of a certain delegation and made a political assessment of Liao Mosha, saying that he had a "firm political stance" in past movements, but only had "some erroneous views in academics." They deceived those above and those below, engaging in the evil act of deceiving the Party Central Committee, deceiving Chairman Mao, and deceiving the people of the whole country. Due to the huge political pressure from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, they played another conspiracy: to have Liao Mosha write a so-called self-criticism to muddle through.

    As early as August 1961, Liao Mosha published "The Harmlessness of Ghosts," defending Meng Chao's evil spirit "Li Huiniang" and inciting demons and monsters to oppose the Party and socialism. Three and a half years passed before Liao Mosha published a so-called "self-criticism" on February 17, 1965 – "My 'The Harmlessness of Ghosts' is Wrong." This was a big poisonous weed in the name of false self-criticism but actually launching an attack. Liao Mosha completely evaded his political problems of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought, saying that the "most fundamental reason" was that he "sometimes lost vigilance in class struggle" and had "a kind of wrong preference" for literary heritage, and therefore "lost direction" on the cultural front, and that all of this was "unconscious."

    The big backstage boss of the "Three-Family Village" also disseminated the fallacy: "Is your mind 100% Marxism? Is there not a bit of feudalism and capitalism? I don't believe it!" This is a thorough sophistry. They first confused the line between the enemy and ourselves, dressing up those anti-communist and anti-people elements as "revolutionaries" who stood on the socialist position, putting revolutionaries and reactionaries in the same pot, "combining two into one," and then used the reactionary fallacy of "everyone has a share in erroneous statements" to suppress the revolutionary left's exposure and struggle against the counter-revolutionary right and attack the left.

    They angrily scolded the left: Liao Mosha himself already feels uncomfortable, do you still want to criticize him? This is "clinging and not letting go," is "not allowing revolution," you are "Master Zhao!" They smeared the revolutionary left as the counter-revolutionary "Master Zhao." The "Three-Family Village" and its big backstage boss are such a group of black gang figures who reverse right and wrong, call a deer a horse, are unreasonable, and act arbitrarily.

    The editor's note added by the former *Beijing Evening News* when publishing Liao Mosha's article completely spoke according to the intention of this counter-revolutionary black gang. It said: Liao Mosha "actually spread anti-scientific, anti-Marxist-Leninist, and anti-socialist ideological poisons." Only in "thought" is there something anti-Marxist-Leninist, what is this? Until mid-April 1966, they felt that their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities could not continue, so they concocted a "4.16" conspiracy. On April 16, the "Three-Family Village's" anti-Party and anti-socialist tools *Frontline* and the former *Beijing Daily* published so-called "criticism" materials about the "Three-Family Village" and *Yanshan Night Talks*, giving Liao Mosha an empty label of "consciously opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought," lightly passing over Liao Mosha's consistent crimes of anti-communism and anti-people.

    The progress of the revolutionary struggle was something the "Three-Family Village" black gang and their backstage boss did not expect. The conspiracy was exposed, further revealing their ugly faces. As of now, the big scam of the "Three-Family Village" and its backstage boss's fake struggle and real protection of Liao Mosha has been revealed to the world.

    To say that Liao Mosha is a "revolutionary" with a "firm stance" who only unconsciously spread "anti-scientific, anti-Marxist-Leninist" "thoughts" is a monstrous lie. Liao Mosha's life is a life of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism.

    Liao Mosha's ferocious face must be exposed deeply, thoroughly, and completely.

    The Vanguard of Chiang Kai-shek's Cultural "Encirclement and Suppression"

    Lu Xun is a giant of China's new democratic cultural revolution. Chairman Mao made a high evaluation of Lu Xun's great contribution to the Chinese revolution in "On New Democracy." Chairman Mao said: Lu Xun is "the greatest and most heroic flag-bearer of the cultural new army" led by the Chinese Communist Party. "Lu Xun is the chief general of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary. Lu Xun's bones are the hardest. He has no trace of servility or flattery. This is the most precious character of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries. Lu Xun is a peerless national hero who, on the cultural front, represents the majority of the entire nation and charges forward against the enemy in the most correct, bravest, most determined, most loyal, and most enthusiastic way." Precisely because Lu Xun is the greatest and most heroic cultural revolutionary flag-bearer who charges forward against the enemy, all kinds of class enemies, imperialist running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, comprador literati, feudal remnants, traitorous spies, Trotskyite black gangs, etc., carried out the most shameless and vicious attacks on him.

    Lu Xun wrote many essays that, like sharp daggers, pierced Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. Nationalist Party special agent publications such as *Social News* and *Great Evening News*, the *Micro-Words* run by Nationalist Party crony Pan Gongzhan, Chiang Kai-shek's court literati Wang Pingling, traitor Yang Cunren, rogue Zhang Ziping, etc., all came to attack Lu Xun. Among this group of reactionary figures was Liao Mosha.

    At that time, Lu Xun's essays published in newspapers often had a circle of borders. Liao Mosha, under the pseudonym Lin Mo, wrote an essay titled "On 'Border Literature'," published in the most reactionary *Great Evening News*. This essay slandered Lu Xun's articles as "not painful or itchy, without any landing point," "repeating over and over again, all becoming reasonable, exhausting the ability of the Eight-legged Essay," and "permeated with poison, spreading妖言." Saying that "this border style" is "a variant of short essays after entering the bird path," and spraying dog blood, cursing Lu Xun as a "comprador" who "operates business for foreigners." Echoing Liao Mosha's vicious curse, a Nationalist Party official named Wen Gongzhi slandered Lu Xun as "the vanguard (traitor) who promotes Western aggression." There were many who criticized Lu Xun at that time, but "the rest of the sneaky and dodging attacks are far from the above two" (*Complete Works of Lu Xun*, Volume 5, page 342).

    The words of Liao Mosha, Wen Gongzhi, and the like slandering Lu Xun were completely in the same tone as the dictator and traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek viciously cursed the Communist Party for "not having the slightest anti-imperialist work, and obstructing and destroying the national anti-imperialist movement." The faithful running dog of imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, scolded the Communist Party, the savior of the Chinese nation, for not being anti-imperialist; Wen Gongzhi and Liao Mosha, as court literati of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group, slandered the national hero Lu Xun as "the vanguard who promotes Western aggression." Only the dictator and traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs Liao Mosha and the like could do this kind of despicable and shameless deed.

    Regarding Liao Mosha's "encirclement and suppression," Lu Xun, on the one hand, gave a devastating counterattack, and on the other hand, expressed great contempt. He used Liao Mosha's venomous words shot from "changing his name and hanging it on a hidden arrow" – "border literature" – as the title of his essay collection.

    Betraying the revolution, throwing himself into the Nationalist Party reactionaries, and acting as the vanguard of Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression" of the giant of the Chinese cultural revolution – Lu Xun – this is the evil deed that Liao Mosha did in his youth.

    The Loyal Lackey of the Nationalist Party Reactionaries

    In 1941 and 1942, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong led the army and people of the liberated areas to carry out the Great Production Movement and the Rectification Movement, overcoming the serious difficulties caused by the Japanese invaders' barbaric attacks and the Nationalist Party's encirclement and blockade. The Party was unprecedentedly united, and the liberated areas were further consolidated and developed. The Nationalist Party's reactionary rule was corrupt to the extreme, and the people were seething with resentment. Therefore, domestic and foreign reactionaries hated the liberated areas even more. In 1943, the Nationalist Party mobilized a large number of troops to prepare to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, setting off the third anti-communist high tide.

    It was at this time that Liao Mosha wrote a so-called "historical" novel "Tour of Xianyang" in 1943 (included in *The Legend of Deer and Horse* after liberation). The story is about Lord Mengchang of Qi going to the Qin Kingdom, where the King of Qin detained Lord Mengchang and did not let him leave, and sent special agents to monitor him. Lord Mengchang used a thousand gold to buy a fox fur coat and gave it to the King of Qin's favorite concubine, and bribed Qin officials, finally escaping from Xianyang.

    The "special agents," "intelligence," and "reconnaissance" mentioned in the article are all modern language. Obviously, Liao Mosha is not talking about history, but reality; he is not talking about history for the sake of talking about history, but for the needs of the political struggle in reality.

    So, for the needs of which class's political struggle was Liao Mosha doing this?

    The ancient Qin Kingdom was located west of Hangu Pass, in the Shaanxi area today. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, this area was the location of the anti-Japanese holy land led by the Chinese Communist Party – the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

    "Tour of Xianyang" slanders that "Qin Kingdom's" "intelligence and reconnaissance" are very strict, "eyes are following everywhere," "King of Qin's" subordinates are "greedy and corrupt," and "there are chicken thieves and dog robbers everywhere," and so on.

    These words of Liao Mosha cursing "Qin Kingdom" are exactly the same as the words of the Nationalist Party propaganda organs viciously slandering the Communist Party and the anti-Japanese holy land of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region at that time. *How to Fight the CCP*, an extremely reactionary book published by the Nationalist Party's Unified Publishing House in July 1942, slandered our liberated areas as "densely populated with reconnaissance networks" and "secretly ordered all levels of personnel to implement mutual surveillance." Deng Wenyin, Chiang Kai-shek's secret service chief, slandered Yan'an as "terrifying day and night," and the staff was "either corrupt or incompetent." *Politics Under the CCP's Separatist Rule*, published in June 1943, slandered that "tyranny and corruption" in the border areas "exceeded expectations." Please compare, aren't Liao Mosha's cursing words a replica of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries' cursing words against the Communist Party?

    At that time, Liao Mosha, on the one hand, viciously slandered the liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party, and on the other hand, enthusiastically praised the Nationalist Party's reactionary rule.

    In February 1944, Liao Mosha wrote "Phoenix, Phoenix!," flatteringly praising Confucius, saying that "Confucius is not only in a prominent position," but also "benefits the people" and "is happy to be humble." Saying that since Confucius took over the affairs of the chancellor, "there have indeed been some visible achievements that make people happy," and the social order is "not as complicated and chaotic as before." The article specially fabricated a peaceful and prosperous era of "no one picking up lost items on the road" and "no one closing their doors at night." A villager entered the city and lost his package. People told him: It doesn't matter, "go find the police." The police pointed the halberd in his hand upwards, "the large package is hanging high on a wooden pillar in the center of the street." The police also earnestly enlightened the villager: "This is the current Chancellor Kong's decree, 'Do not greed for wealth'." Why is politics so clear? Liao Mosha replied: "Because there is a sage above as the chancellor."

    So, who is this "current" Chancellor Kong?

    The Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, in order to adapt to the needs of imperialism and eliminate the Communist Party, on the one hand, slandered the liberated areas as "bandit areas" with poor people, corrupt officials, and rampant thieves; on the other hand, they beautified the Nationalist Party's reactionary-controlled areas as a "peaceful and prosperous era" with clear officialdom and economic prosperity. In order to promote this kind of reactionary propaganda, in November 1943, the Chiang Kai-shek group staged an ugly drama praising the "great achievements" of Kong Xiangxi, the vice president of the Nationalist Party's Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. On November 1, a conference was held to celebrate Kong Xiangxi's tenth anniversary as Minister of Finance, presided over by Chiang Kai-shek himself, who also issued a eulogy. The heads of the Chiang Kai-shek government, such as Soong Tzu-wen, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, etc., all flatteringly praised Kong Xiangxi's so-called "good governance." American masters, such as U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, also sent "congratulatory telegrams" to their running dog Kong Xiangxi. The Nationalist Party's *Central Daily News* and *Ta Kung Pao* continuously published a large number of stinking goods praising Kong Xiangxi. *Economic Report* published a special issue with red headlines to commemorate Kong Xiangxi's tenth anniversary as president. The gang unanimously praised Kong Xiangxi's great achievements in "abolishing harsh taxes, clarifying officialdom, enriching the people and goods, and making the soldiers full and the horses strong."

    Kong Xiangxi promoted himself as a descendant of Confucius, and some shameless literati followed suit, saying that Kong Xiangxi was a "descendant of the sage." A reactionary politician praised Kong Xiangxi for "remembering his ancestor's meaning of 'saving and thinning taxes' to 'make the people rich, and what is lacking to the ruler'," and "abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous donations to benefit the people's livelihood." Kong Xiangxi was a big bureaucrat in Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary group who was both cruel and stupid and famous for corruption, and he was the political representative of the Chiang Kai-shek group. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters praised Kong Xiangxi so much was to praise the entire Nationalist Party's reactionary rule and create public opinion for attacking the Communist Party and the liberated areas.

    It is very clear that Liao Mosha's "Phoenix, Phoenix!" closely served Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary political conspiracy. His words praising "Confucius" were almost all copied word for word from the shameless literati, reactionary politicians, and the Nationalist Party's propaganda organs and special agent organs at that time. Liao Mosha boasted that the Nationalist Party's reactionary rule was a royal road utopia of "no one closing their doors at night" and "no one picking up lost items on the road"; he boasted that Kong Xiangxi was a "current" "sage," like "the North Star," with "all the stars surrounding him." Even the Nationalist Party's propaganda machine at the time did not dare to say these words openly. This fact once again shows that Liao Mosha was a faithful lackey who wholeheartedly served the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries.

    The Anti-Communist Conspirator

    The Third Revolutionary Civil War was a decisive battle between the people's revolutionary forces led by the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary forces led by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In December 1947, Chairman Mao pointed out in the historically significant "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army has reversed the counter-revolutionary wheel of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on this land of China, causing it to head towards destruction, and promoted its own revolutionary wheel, causing it to head towards victory." "This is the turning point in the development of Chiang Kai-shek's twenty years of counter-revolutionary rule from development to elimination. This is the turning point in the development of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years from development to elimination."

    At this great turning point, what did Liao Mosha do?

    In December 1947, Liao Mosha wrote a "historical" novel "Leaving Yin," which was about King Zhou of Yin (see *The Legend of Deer and Horse*). According to historical records, in the last years of King Zhou of Yin's reign, the world was in turmoil, people's hearts were scattered, the people complained, and the situation was getting worse and worse. At that time, in the Qishan area (northwest of Shaanxi today), the liberation war led by Xibo Chang and King Wu Fa was welcomed by the masses. Under the domestic class struggle situation at that time, it could be seen without any explanation that Zhou mentioned by Liao Mosha refers to Chiang Kai-shek, and Xiqi he mentioned is the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region led by the Chinese Communist Party.

    In "Leaving Yin," what attitude did Liao Mosha take towards King Zhou of Yin? What attitude did he take towards Xibo Chang? Liao Mosha had to admit that King Zhou "did all the bad things and said all the bad words," admitting that "the vassals are gradually losing heart." But he still tried his best to praise Ehou's advice to King Zhou as "loyal and courageous." He wanted people to be loyal to King Zhou of Yin's reactionary rule and use all means to "save the Yin Shang world." He even shamelessly praised Zhou as "The King of Heaven is wise!" On the other hand, he tried his best to portray Xibo Chang's insidious and cunning, saying that "Xibo hid his head and showed his tail" and "is an ambitious warlord," and is very "insidious."

    These words of Liao Mosha scolding Xibo Chang were exactly the same as the words of dictator and traitor Chiang Kai-shek scolding the Communist Party at that time. Chiang Kai-shek scolded the Communist Party as "the most insidious and vicious bandits and outlaws in Chinese history," who were "occupying territory with troops" and had "ambitions and conspiracies." Obviously, the above-mentioned cursing words of Liao Mosha were wholesale from Chiang Kai-shek's rumor company.

    Liao Mosha not only cursed, but also wanted to kill "Xibo Chang."

    A few years before the collapse of King Zhou of Yin's reactionary rule, King Zhou believed that Xibo Chang was going to "rebel," "conspire and move differently, and is unreliable," so he locked him up in a big prison. Xibo Chang dedicated a piece of land in Luoxi to Zhou, and Zhou released him; Zuyi, a minister under King Zhou, firmly opposed it. Please read the following description:

    King Zhou: "I have already released him," "I also gave him bows, arrows, axes, halberds, and a lot of foreign weapons. He can expand the army, he can be dedicated to conquest, and he will always be the chief of Xibo."

    Zuyi recalled that Xibo Chang had attacked Misu and destroyed the Qi Kingdom, and he was also an ambitious warlord, very insidious, so he said: "The King is as benevolent as the sky, but the sky has ended Yin's life. If such great power is given to him, I don't know what he will do?" Bigan added: "The turtle shell is false, no one dares to know the auspicious, and I also feel that the King's heart is too good."

    Anyone with discerning eyes can see that Xibo Chang mentioned by Liao Mosha here is an allusion to our great leader Chairman Mao. In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talks" conspiracy, in August 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to negotiate with the Nationalist Party. The people of the whole country praised Chairman Mao for his great courage in the cause of the people's revolution. The workers in Chongqing shouted: "Mao Zedong – our leader, our savior." Of course, Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, the murderous devil, could do anything. However, because the revolutionary people of the entire China and the revolutionary people of the whole world stood on Chairman Mao's side, Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to directly attack Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to force the Communist Party to hand over military power and the power of the liberated areas at the negotiating table also failed. People under Chiang Kai-shek "complained" about the failure of this evil conspiracy. They complained that Chiang Kai-shek was "too kind" and complained that Chiang Kai-shek did not "eliminate" the army and government of the liberated areas in the "meeting minutes." Liao Mosha borrowed Zuyi's mouth to complain that King Zhou sent Xibo Chang back to Xiqi, complaining that King Zhou let Xibo Chang "expand the army" and gave such great power to Xibo Chang, saying that his "heart is too good." Isn't this the same as the words of those people under Chiang Kai-shek?

    Please think about it: Liao Mosha is so extremely ferocious that he wants to attack our greatest leader Chairman Mao. How black is his heart!

    When the Western Zhou army crossed the Mengjin River and advanced towards the Yin capital like a broken bamboo, King Zhou of Yin's reactionary rule completely collapsed, and the "third road" and "middle line" were shattered. The people welcomed the royal army with pot of food. Everyone went to Xiqi. Under this situation, where did Liao Mosha go? At that time, the civil and military officials under King Zhou, such as Weizi, Taishi Pi, Li Shiqiang, Taidian, Sanyi Sheng, etc., a large number of people left Yin and went west. However, Zuyi, the minister that Liao Mosha deliberately described, took a completely different attitude. Weizi, Taishi Pi, and others believed that there was no hope for Zhou, so they could only go to Xiqi. Zuyi said: "Alas, alas, him (referring to Xibo), what is the difference between him and Zhou? And he is slippery."

    Weizi advocated asking Xibo to send troops to destroy Zhou. Zuyi replied: "That won't work. If you destroy one Zhou, won't another Zhou come out? I think Ji Chang is a Zhou, he is more insidious than Zhou." "Soon it was rumored that Zuyi rebelled in the East China Sea," the story ended like this.

    Didn't American imperialism and the Nationalist Party reactionaries spread rumors saying that Chiang Kai-shek was indeed不行, but the Communist Party was worse than Chiang Kai-shek? Didn't they say that the People's Liberation War was "using violence to replace violence"? Didn't some political conspirators advocate setting up another stove to save the semi-colonial and semi-feudal reactionary rule?

    Here, we see the hideous face of a counter-revolutionary element. Until the complete collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, Liao Mosha still viciously cursed that the Communist Party was no different from the Nationalist Party, even worse than the Nationalist Party. He wanted to resist to the end and insist on being the enemy of the Communist Party and the entire Chinese people.

    On April 21, 1949, Chairman Mao issued an order to advance to the whole country, calling on all commanders and fighters to bravely advance and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all Nationalist Party reactionaries who dared to resist. The iron fist of the million-strong army shattered Liao Mosha's dream of "rebellion in the East China Sea."

    A Rightist Who Slipped Through the Net

    Liao Mosha, like Deng Tuo, is a rightist who slipped through the net.

    In February 1956, the Khrushchev revisionist group convened the 20th Congress of the CPSU, usurping party, political, and military power. In October of the same year, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in Hungary. Under the international counter-revolutionary trend, Liao Mosha, this veteran anti-communist, jumped out impatiently and acted as the vanguard of the rightists attacking the Party.

    From September to December 1956, Liao Mosha, using the name Wen Bi, used the general title "Random Notes" in *New Observation* to continuously shoot dense poisonous arrows at the proletariat.

    As soon as Liao Mosha came on stage, he viciously attacked the so-called "new Eight-legged Essay." What is the new Eight-legged Essay? Liao Mosha said that the new Eight-legged Essay is: "Advantages, disadvantages, reasons, experiences, existing problems, and solutions to problems." He slandered that this kind of Eight-legged Essay is "moving some dogmas or classics," "only allowing the sages to speak, and talking about the principles taught by the Four Books and Five Classics."

    After liberation, the broad masses of the people eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works, which made Liao Mosha, this counter-revolutionary element, furious, scolding the so-called Eight-legged Essay, saying that this kind of Eight-legged Essay is "flooding the world, visible everywhere," "empty and full of nonsense." And said: "Only this kind of 'Eight-legged Essay' will be approved by the leaders."

    Isn't this clearly attacking the brilliant works of Chairman Mao? Isn't this clearly slandering the great movement of the people of the whole country to study Chairman Mao's works? Tell Liao Mosha, we just don't allow your poisonous weeds like "Random Notes" and "Miscellaneous Records" to flood; we just want to learn Chairman Mao's works very well, and talk a lot about Mao Zedong Thought, only allowing the "words of the sages" of the proletariat.

    "Flooding the world, visible everywhere"? You are right, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have indeed spread all over the world and become the ideological weapons of the revolutionary people all over the world.

    What all reactionaries hate most is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, under the banner of opposing so-called "bureaucratism," Liao Mosha frantically attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    In August 1956, our newspaper reported a folk remedy prescribed by a doctor that eating tadpoles can prevent pregnancy. Liao Mosha seized such a small problem and used a sensational title "Swallowing Tadpoles Alive," doing his best to slander and insult the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Liao Mosha deliberately raised the question: "Will the female workers swallow other parasite eggs together when they swallow tadpoles alive?" He answered seditiously, "Is there any need to say it? They swallowed everything, they swallowed everything!" Then he asked provocatively: "But who should be responsible for this terrible responsibility?" He replied that the doctor who introduced this folk remedy should not be responsible, the newspaper that rushed to publish this news should not be responsible, and the health administration department should not be responsible. Then he turned his pen and pointed the finger directly at the Party Central Committee: "I think about it layer by layer, and I feel confused... There is not even a defendant. If we talk about responsibility, who should bear this responsibility?" "Now, as I see it: this responsibility can only be borne by those poor female compatriots who swallowed tadpoles alive. - The original case can only be treated as a headless case and filed immediately!"

    The responsibility of women eating tadpoles to prevent pregnancy must be investigated "layer by layer" all the way to the Party Central Committee. The Party Central Committee must be placed in the "defendant" seat, otherwise, it will be a "headless case."

    How vicious is Liao Mosha's intention! A doctor introduced a folk remedy for contraception, and some female comrades took it. If this folk remedy has shortcomings, then it only needs to be explained and corrected. If you are not standing on a hostile class position, how can you investigate the responsibility of the Party Central Committee? How can you even incite the "poor" "female compatriots" to oppose the Party Central Committee? Isn't this a complete counter-revolutionary seditious act?

    In December 1956, Liao Mosha wrote an article "The 'Lower Limit' of Bureaucratism," which was even more a black gun directly aimed at the Party Central Committee. He said that one cannot think that "those who are most prone to making bureaucratic mistakes" are only "low-ranking" cadres, "in fact, the higher the official and the greater the power," the more "dust" of bureaucratism they are stained with; therefore, the firepower should be concentrated on "big bureaucrats," and big bureaucratism should not be allowed to "逍遥于批评之外."

    Liao Mosha regarded the great Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat as a great hurdle and disaster for reactionary bourgeois intellectuals. Therefore, he "asked the scholars - that is, the intellectuals - to pay serious attention!" and "to escape this hurdle" and "avoid this disaster."

    Liao Mosha openly clamored: "'If the sage does not die, the great thief will not stop.' I now find that: if the bureaucrat does not die, the Eight-legged Essay will not stop!" Based on his counter-revolutionary experience, he deeply understood that only when the dictatorship of the proletariat is finished can these counter-revolutionary elements escape the hurdle and avoid the disaster.

    Tell the counter-revolutionary elements of Liao Mosha and the like that the great leader of the proletariat is immortal, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is as solid as a copper wall. No matter how cunning you are, no matter who protects you, you can hide on the first day, but you can't hide on the fifteenth; the anti-rightist struggle let you slip through the net, but you cannot escape the legal net of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    A Henchman of the "Three-Family Village" Black Shop Conducting Counter-Revolutionary Restoration

    When the "Three-Family Village" black shop, under the direction of its big backstage boss, launched a major attack on the proletariat, Liao Mosha bared his chest and blew the trumpet, desperately pouncing on us. In a series of articles, he launched a frenzied attack on our great, glorious, and correct Party, on the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.

    The great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our undertakings, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is the magic weapon for our protection. Therefore, Liao Mosha, this stubborn counter-revolutionary element, concentrated all his hatred to attack, vilify, and slander the great Mao Zedong Thought, and actively moved to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration.

    In 1958, under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country developed soaring revolutionary vigor and realized the leap-forward development of the national economy. The bourgeois agents who infiltrated the Party - the right-leaning opportunists - slandered that we had messed up and clamored to "settle accounts" with us. Our Party forcefully refuted the right-leaning opportunists' shameless slanders against the Party's general line. At this time, Liao Mosha jumped out and released a poisonous weed "Learn to Settle Accounts" in the 13th issue of *Frontline* in 1959. He hypocritically said, "We do not approve of this 'settling accounts after autumn faction'"; however, he immediately added a "but," saying that "if we only talk about 'settling accounts,' we not only do not oppose 'settling accounts after autumn,' but also approve of 'settling accounts before autumn,'" he shouted aggressively: "All accounts must be settled," "big accounts and small accounts must be settled together."

    Liao Mosha, this counter-revolutionary element, has been fighting against our Party for decades, and now he believes that the time has come to "settle the general account" with us.

    After Wu Han, the henchman of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, threw out the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," Liao Mosha followed suit. In June 1960, he threw out the big poisonous weed "On 'Digging Soil on Tai Sui's Head'" in *Frontline*. Liao Mosha praised the dead man Wang Chong, praising him as a "tough guy who is not afraid of bumping into 'Tai Sui,'" "stripping the 'words of the sages' beyond recognition." The reader knows at a glance that this is the same black goods as Wu Han's praise of Hai Rui daring to scold the "Emperor." Liao Mosha was encouraging people to dare to "bump into" the Party Central Committee, oppose "solely respecting" Mao Zedong Thought, and allow the "eclecticism" of anti-Party and anti-socialism to run rampant freely.

    The "Three-Family Village" black gang and its big backstage boss believed that the spring of 1961 was the beginning of a great situation for their counter-revolutionary restoration. On January 1, Deng Tuo, the chief manager of the "Three-Family Village" black gang, shouted "The spring breeze is gentle," and passed down the marshal's order to all demons and monsters: "Listen, the spring thunder is about to move, the wilderness is awakening, bid farewell to the old year, and show great ambitions. Take advantage of the good times and beautiful scenery, work together with one heart, adhere to the struggle, and do not hesitate!" In the same month, the counter-revolutionary vanguard Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was quickly published. Liao Mosha closely followed, and on January 20, he beat the war drums on the former *Beijing Evening News*, saying that "spring requires the 'Laba drum' to urge it," "we must start working hard in the spring"; and cursed the so-called "Son of Heaven" who is "not much different from the archbishop."

    The evil wind set off by "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" confused the minds of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. They felt that the time for "great changes in the world" had come. On March 9, Liao Mosha put forward a theory of counter-revolutionary restoration: "Theory of Adapting to Change." When publishing, Liao Mosha felt that this title was too blatant, so he changed it to: "How Confucius and the Author of the *Book of Changes* Observed 'Change'," putting a "academic" coat on the counter-revolutionary theory. Liao Mosha adopted the "using the past to satirize the present" method commonly used by the "Three-Family Village" black gang and issued a mad cry for counter-revolutionary restoration. He said: "At that time" (should be read as now) was an era of "great changes in social history," and "Confucius" was very "conservative," "everything must be done according to

    请看廖沫沙的反革命面目
    林杰
    “三家村”兄弟中，邓拓是混进党内的叛徒，是漏网的大右派，是毛泽东思想的凶恶敌人；吴晗是美帝国主义的奴才，是蒋家王朝的走狗，是洋奴胡适一手培养出来的洋奴的洋奴。那么，廖沫沙呢？
    在我国遭受暂时经济困难的几年，廖沫沙同他的“三家村”兄弟，在他们的后台大老板的指使下，对共产党、对社会主义、对毛泽东思想，展开了疯狂的进攻。这样，广大人民群众就认识了他的反动的政治面目。但是，由于廖沫沙受到了他的后台老板的支持、庇护和纵容，不仅一直逍遥法外，甚至受到进一步的信任和重用。
    在党中央和毛主席指出了廖沫沙的反动面目之后，前北京市委公然同党中央和毛主席对抗。一九六四年七月，他们故意任命廖沫沙为某代表团团长，并且给廖沫沙作政治鉴定，说他在历次运动中“政治立场坚定”，只是在“学术上有些错误观点”。他们瞒上欺下，干着欺骗党中央、欺骗毛主席、欺骗全国人民的罪恶勾当。由于广大工农兵群众的巨大政治压力，他们便玩弄另一个阴谋诡计：叫廖沫沙写一篇所谓自我检讨，应付过关。
    早在一九六一年八月，廖沫沙发表了《有鬼无害论》，替孟超的厉鬼“李慧娘”张目，煽动牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义。中间隔了三年半时间，直到一九六五年二月十七日，廖沫沙才发表一篇所谓“检讨”——《我的〈有鬼无害论〉是错误的》。这是假检讨之名、行进攻之实的大毒草。廖沫沙完全回避自己的反党、反人民、反毛泽东思想的政治问题，说什么“最根本的原因”，是“有的时候失掉了阶级斗争的警惕”，是对文学遗产“有一种错误的偏好”，因此，在文化战线上“迷失方向”，而所有这一切都是“不自觉”的。
    “三家村”的后台大老板还大肆散布这样一种谬论：“难道你的头脑中就是百分之百的马克思主义？没有一点封建主义和资本主义的东西？我就不相信！”这是一个彻头彻尾的诡辩。他们首先是混淆敌我界线，把那些反共、反人民的分子，打扮成为站到社会主义立场的“革命者”，把革命者和反动派一锅煮，好人和坏人“合二而一”，然后就用“错误言论大家有份”的反动谬论，来压制革命左派对反革命右派的揭露和斗争，打击左派。
    他们气势汹汹地责骂左派：廖沫沙自己已经感到难受了，你们还要批判吗？这是“揪住不放”，是“不准革命”，你们是“赵太爷”！他们把革命的左派诬蔑为反革命的“赵太爷”。“三家村”及其后台大老板，就是这样一群颠倒是非、指鹿为马、蛮不讲理、专行独断的黑帮人物。
    前《北京晚报》在发表廖沫沙的文章时所加的编者按，完全是按照这个反革命黑帮的意旨说话的。它说：廖沫沙是“实际上散布了反科学、反马克思列宁主义、反社会主义的思想毒素”。只在“思想”中有反马克思列宁主义的东西，这是什么话？直到一九六六年四月中旬，他们觉得自己反党反社会主义的活动，有些混不下去了，于是搞了一个“四·一六”阴谋。四月十六日，“三家村”反党反社会主义的工具《前线》和前《北京日报》，刊登了所谓关于“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的“批判”资料，给廖沫沙加了一顶“自觉地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想”的空洞帽子，把廖沫沙的一贯的反共反人民的罪行，轻轻带过。
    革命斗争的进程，是“三家村”黑帮和他们的后台老板所料不到的。阴谋被揭穿了，进一步暴露了他们的丑恶面目。事到如今，“三家村”及其后台老板对于廖沫沙的假斗争、真包庇的大骗局，已经大白于世了。
    说廖沫沙是“一个立场坚定”的“革命者”，只是不自觉地散布了“反科学、反马克思列宁主义”的“思想”，这是弥天大谎。廖沫沙的一生，是反共、反人民、反社会主义的一生。
    廖沫沙的凶恶面目，必须揭深、揭透、揭彻底。
    蒋介石文化“围剿”的急先锋
    鲁迅是中国新民主主义文化革命的巨人。鲁迅对中国革命的伟大功勋，毛主席在《新民主主义论》中，作了高度的评价。毛主席说：鲁迅是中国共产党所领导的“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手。鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格。鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。”正因为鲁迅是向敌人冲锋陷阵的最伟大最英勇的文化革命旗手，因此，形形色色的阶级敌人，帝国主义走狗，蒋介石匪帮，买办文人，封建遗孽，汉奸特务，托洛茨基黑帮等等，对他进行了最无耻最凶恶的攻击。
    鲁迅写的许多杂文，象锋利的匕首一样，刺向蒋介石的反动统治。国民党的特务刊物《社会新闻》、《大晚报》，国民党党棍潘公展办的《微言》，蒋介石的御用文人王平陵、叛徒杨邨人，流氓张资平等等，都来攻击鲁迅。在这批反动人物中，就有廖沫沙。
    当时鲁迅在报上发表的杂文，往往围绕一圈花边。廖沫沙便化名林默，写了一篇题为《论“花边文学”》的杂文，发表在最反动的《大晚报》上。这篇杂文诬蔑鲁迅的文章“不痛不痒，毫无着落”，“翻来复去，都成了道理，颇尽了八股的能事”，“渗有毒汁，散布了妖言”。说什么“这花边体”是“走入鸟道以后的小品文变种”，并且狗血喷人，咒骂鲁迅是“帮洋人经营生意”的“买办”。同廖沫沙这个恶毒咒骂相呼应，国民党的一位官老爷文公直，则诬蔑鲁迅是“为西人侵略张目的急先锋（汉奸）”。当时笔伐鲁迅的很多，但是，“其余的一些鬼鬼祟祟，躲躲闪闪的攻击，离上举的两位（引者注：指廖沫沙、文公直）还差得很远”（《鲁迅全集》第五卷，第三四二页）。
    廖沫沙、文公直之流诬蔑鲁迅的话，同独夫民贼蒋介石完全是一个腔调。蒋介石恶毒地咒骂共产党“没有丝毫反帝国主义的工作，而且障碍破坏民族的反帝运动”。帝国主义的忠实走狗蒋介石，骂中华民族的救星共产党不反帝；身为蒋介石反动集团御用文人的文公直、廖沫沙则诬蔑民族英雄鲁迅是“为西人侵略张目的急先锋”。这种卑鄙无耻的勾当，只有独夫民贼蒋介石及他的走狗廖沫沙之徒，才干得出来。
    对于廖沫沙的“围剿”，鲁迅一方面给以毁灭性的反击，同时，又表示极大的藐视。他把廖沫沙“换掉姓名挂在暗箭上”射来的刻毒的话——“花边文学”，作为自己杂文集的书名。
    叛变革命，投身国民党反动派，充当了蒋介石对中国文化革命巨人——鲁迅的“围剿”的急先锋，这就是廖沫沙在青年时代所干的罪恶勾当。
    国民党反动派的忠实奴才
    一九四一年和一九四二年，党和毛泽东同志领导解放区军民，开展了大生产运动和整风运动，克服了由于日寇的野蛮进攻和国民党的包围封锁所造成的严重困难。党空前地团结起来了，解放区得到了进一步的巩固和发展。而国民党反动统治则腐败到极点，民怨沸腾。因此，国内外反动派对解放区更加仇恨。一九四三年，国民党调动大批军队准备进攻陕甘宁边区，掀起了第三次反共高潮。
    正是在这个时候，廖沫沙在一九四三年写了一篇所谓的“历史”小说《咸阳游》（解放后收入《鹿马传》）。故事是讲齐国的孟尝君到了秦国，秦王把孟尝君扣住不让走，并且派了特务来监视他。孟尝君用千金买了一件狐白裘送给秦王的幸姬，并且向秦国的官吏进行贿赂，终于逃出了咸阳。
    文中所说的“特务”、“情报”、“侦缉”等等，都是现代的语言。显然，廖沫沙讲的不是历史，而是现实，不是为讲历史而讲历史，而是为了现实的政治斗争的需要而讲历史。
    那么，廖沫沙是为了哪个阶级的政治斗争的需要呢？
    古代秦国在今函谷关以西，陕西一带。这一带，在抗日战争时期，是中国共产党领导的抗日圣地——陕甘宁边区所在地。
    《咸阳游》污蔑“秦国”的“情报和侦缉”很严密，“到处有眼睛跟着”，“秦王”左右“贪黩”，到处“有鸡鸣狗盗之流存在”等等。
    廖沫沙这些咒骂“秦国”的话，同当时国民党宣传机关恶毒地诽谤共产党和抗日圣地陕甘宁边区的话是一模一样的。一九四二年七月，国民党统一出版社出版的名叫《怎样与中共斗争》这本极端反动的书，即诬蔑我们的解放区“密布侦查网”，“密令各级人员实行互相监视”。蒋介石的特务头子邓文仪诬蔑延安“白天晚上都是恐怖”，工作人员“不是贪污腐败，就是低能无能”。一九四三年六月出版的《中共割据下之政治》，诬蔑边区各地“横暴贪污，殊出人意料之外”。请读者们比较一下，廖沫沙那些骂人的话，不就是蒋介石反动派咒骂共产党的话的翻版吗？
    当时，廖沫沙一方面恶毒地诬蔑中国共产党领导的解放区，一方面则狂热地歌颂国民党的反动统治。
    一九四四年二月，廖沫沙写了《凤兮，凤兮！》，肉麻地吹捧孔子，说“孔子不只是身居显贵”，而且是“养民也惠”，“乐以其贵下人”。说孔子摄行相事以来，“就着着实实有了一些看得见的成绩，使人欣慰”，社会秩序也“不象以往那么牵牵扯扯，混乱杂凑了”。文章特地编造了一个“路不拾遗”、“夜不闭户”的太平盛世。一个乡下人进城，丢了包裹。人们告诉他：不要紧，“去找警察”。那警察把手中的长戈向上一指，“大包裹高高悬在街中心的一根木柱上”。警察还谆谆开导这位乡下老：“这是当今孔相爷的法令，‘临财勿苟得’”。为什么政治这么清明呢？廖沫沙回答说：“原来有圣人在上面作宰相”。
    那么，这位“当今”的孔相爷究竟是谁呢？
    蒋介石反动派，为了适应帝国主义的需要，消灭共产党，一方面诬蔑解放区是民贫吏贪、盗贼横行的“匪区”；另方面则美化国民党的反动统治区是吏治清明、经济繁荣的“太平盛世”。蒋介石集团为了推行这种反动宣传，一九四三年十一月间，演了一出吹捧国民党行政院副院长兼财政部长孔祥熙的“伟大勋迹”的丑剧。十一月一日，举行了庆祝孔祥熙任财政部长十周年的大会，蒋介石亲自主持并颁颂词。蒋介石政府的头目们，如宋子文、何应钦、张群等等，都肉麻地吹捧孔祥熙的所谓“德政”。美国主子，如美国陆军部长史汀生、海军部长诺克斯、财政部长摩根索等，也都向他们的走狗孔祥熙发来“贺电”。国民党的《中央日报》、《大公报》连续发表了大量吹捧孔祥熙的臭货。《经济汇报》发表了红字标题的《孔总裁就任十周年纪念专刊》。群丑们一致吹捧孔祥熙“废除苛杂，澄清吏治，民繁物庶，士饱马腾”的伟大成就。
    孔祥熙宣传自己是孔子的子孙，一些无耻文人则跟着说孔祥熙是“圣裔”。有一个反动政客吹捧孔祥熙是“念及乃祖‘节用薄敛’致‘百姓足，君孰不足’之义”，“废除苛税杂捐，以利民生”的伟人。孔祥熙是蒋介石反动集团的一个既残暴愚蠢又以贪污出名的大官僚，是蒋介石集团的政治代表。蒋介石和他的美国主子所以这样大肆吹捧孔祥熙，就是吹捧整个国民党的反动统治，为向共产党和解放区进攻制造舆论。
    事情很明白，廖沫沙的《凤兮，凤兮！》就是密切为蒋介石的这种反动政治阴谋服务的。他歌颂“孔子”的那些话，几乎都是逐字逐句从当时那些无耻文人、反动政客及国民党的宣传机关和特务机关那里抄来的。廖沫沙吹捧国民党的反动统治是“夜不闭户”、“道不拾遗”的王道乐土；吹捧孔祥熙是“当今”的“圣人”，象“北辰”一样“而众星环拱之”。这些话，甚至连当时的国民党宣传机器也是不敢明目张胆说的。这一事实又一次说明，廖沫沙是死心塌地为蒋介石反动派服务的忠实奴才。
    反共的阴谋家
    第三次国内革命战争时期，是以中国共产党为领导的人民革命力量同以蒋介石匪帮为首的反动力量的决战时期。一九四七年十二月，毛主席在具有伟大历史意义的《目前形势和我们的任务》中指出，“中国人民解放军已经在中国这一块土地上扭转了美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向覆灭的道路，推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。”“这是蒋介石的二十年反革命统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点。”
    在这个伟大的转变时刻，廖沫沙干了些什么呢？
    一九四七年十二月，廖沫沙写了一篇“历史”小说《离殷》，算是讲殷纣王的事（见《鹿马传》）。据历史记载，殷纣王统治的末期，天下汹汹，人心离散，老百姓怨声载道，局面越来越糟。而当时，在岐山一带（今陕西西北部），由西伯昌和武王发领导的解放战争，却受到了群众的欢迎。在当时国内阶级斗争形势下，几乎用不到任何说明即可看出，廖沫沙所说的纣是指蒋介石，而他所说的西岐则是中国共产党领导的陕甘宁边区。
    廖沫沙在《离殷》中，对殷纣王采取什么态度呢？对西伯昌又采取什么态度呢？廖沫沙不得不承认纣王“作尽坏事，说尽坏话”，承认“诸侯逐渐离心”。但是他仍然竭力歌颂鄂侯向纣王进谏的举动是“忠诚勇敢”。他要人们对殷纣王的反动统治尽忠，要用一切办法来“挽救殷商的天下”。甚至还无耻地歌颂纣是“天王圣明！”另一方面，则极力刻划西伯昌的阴险和狡猾，说“西伯藏头露尾”“是个野心的军阀”，并且很“阴险”。
    廖沫沙这些骂西伯昌的话，同当时独夫民贼蒋介石骂共产党的话完全一样。蒋介石骂共产党是“中国有史以来最阴险最毒辣的盗匪流寇”，是“拥兵割据”，有“野心阴谋”。显然，廖沫沙上述骂人的话，就是从蒋介石的造谣公司中批发来的。
    廖沫沙不仅骂骂而已，而且要杀害“西伯昌”。
    殷纣的反动统治崩溃前几年，纣王认为西伯昌要“造反”，“阴谋异动，靠不住”，便把他关在大监牢里。西伯昌献了洛西一片地给纣，纣把他放了；纣王下面的一位大臣祖伊坚决反对。请看下面这段描述：
    纣王：“我已经把他放了”，“我还给了他弓矢斧钺，不少的外国武器，他可以扩编军队，他可以专任征伐，永为西伯之长。”
    祖伊想起西伯昌曾经伐密须、灭耆国，也是个野心的军阀，很阴险，便说：“大王其仁如天，不过天讫殷命，这样大的权力交给他，可不知道他怎么样？”比干补充说：“假人元龟，无敢知吉，我也觉得大王的心肠太好了”。
    明眼人一看就知道，廖沫沙这里所说的西伯昌，就是影射我们伟大的领袖毛主席。为了粉碎蒋介石“和平谈判”阴谋，一九四五年八月，毛泽东同志亲自到重庆同国民党谈判。全国人民都歌颂毛主席为人民革命事业的大勇，重庆的工人高呼：“毛泽东——我们的领袖，我们的救星”。美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石这个杀人不眨眼的魔王，当然什么事都干得出来的。但是，由于全中国革命人民、全世界革命人民都站在毛主席这一边，蒋介石不敢直接对中国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席下毒手。蒋介石企图在谈判桌上，逼使共产党交出军权和解放区政权的阴谋也失败了。蒋介石手下的人，对蒋介石的这个罪恶阴谋的失败，有所“埋怨”。他们抱怨蒋介石“太仁慈了”，抱怨蒋介石在“会谈记要”中，没有“消灭”解放区的军队和政权。廖沫沙借祖伊的嘴埋怨纣王把西伯昌放回西岐去，埋怨纣王让西伯昌“可以扩编军队”，把这样大的权力交给西伯昌，是“心肠太好了”。这同蒋介石手下那班人的话，不是如出一辙吗？
    请读者们想一想：廖沫沙穷凶极恶到这种程度，竟要对我们最伟大的领袖毛主席下毒手，他的心肠是多么的黑啊！
    当西周的军队渡过孟津，势如破竹似地向殷都进发的时候，殷纣的反动统治完全崩溃了，“第三条道路”、“中间路线”都破灭了。人民群众壶浆以迎王师，大家纷纷去投奔西岐。在这个形势下，廖沫沙是何去何从呢？当时，纣王下面的文武百官，如微子、太师疪，李师强，太颠，散宜生等等，大批的人都离殷西去。但是，廖沫沙所刻意描写的大臣祖伊，却采取了完全不同的态度。微子、太师疪等都认为，纣没有希望了，只有投奔西岐。祖伊却说：“唉，唉，他（引者注：指西伯）吗，他和纣有什么两样呢？而且他滑头。”
    微子主张请西伯起兵来灭纣。祖伊回答说：“那不行，灭了一个纣，难道没有另一个纣出来？我看姬昌就是一个纣，他比纣更阴险。”“不久就传说祖伊在东海造反了”，故事就这样结束。
    当时美帝国主义和国民党反动派不是造谣说，蒋介石固然不行，但是共产党比蒋介石更坏吗？不是说人民解放战争是“以暴易暴”吗？一些政治阴谋家不是主张另起炉灶，来挽救半殖民地半封建的反动统治吗？
    在这里，我们看到了一个反革命分子的狰狞面目。一直到蒋介石反动统治完全垮台的时候，廖沫沙还恶毒地咒骂共产党同国民党没有两样，甚至比国民党更坏。他要顽抗到底，坚持同共产党和全中国人民为敌。
    一九四九年四月二十一日，毛主席发出向全国进军的命令，号召全体指战员，奋勇前进，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭一切敢于抵抗的国民党反动派。百万雄师的大铁拳，把廖沫沙“在东海造反”的幻梦粉碎了。
    漏网的大右派
    廖沫沙同邓拓一样，是漏网的大右派。
    一九五六年二月，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团召开了苏共二十次代表大会，篡夺了党权、政权、军权。同年十月，匈牙利发生反革命叛乱。在国际反革命逆流下，廖沫沙这个反共的老手，就迫不及待地跳出来，充当了右派分子向党进攻的急先锋。
    一九五六年九月至十二月间，廖沫沙用闻璧这个名字，在《新观察》上，以《乱弹杂记》为总标题，连续向无产阶级射出了密集的毒箭。
    廖沫沙一出场，就恶毒地攻击所谓“新八股”。什么叫新八股呢？廖沫沙说，新八股就是：“优点、缺点、原因、经验、存在问题、解决问题的办法”。他污蔑说，这种八股文，都是“搬弄一些教条或经典”，“只许为圣贤立言，讲四书五经所讲过的道理”。
    解放之后，广大人民群众如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作，这就使得廖沫沙这个反革命分子暴跳如雷，大骂所谓八股文，说这样的八股文“滔滔天下，触目可见”，“言之无物，通篇是废话”。并且说：“只有这样的‘八股文’才会得到领导人的赞许”。
    这不是明明白白地攻击金光灿烂的毛主席著作吗？这不是明明白白地污蔑全国人民学习毛主席著作的伟大运动吗？告诉廖沫沙，我们就是不准你的“乱弹”“杂记”这些大毒草泛滥；就是要大学特学毛主席著作，大讲特讲毛泽东思想，只许讲无产阶级的“圣贤之言”。
    “滔滔天下，触目可见”吗？你们说对了，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想确实已经传遍全天下，成为全世界革命人民的思想武器了。
    一切反动派最恨的是无产阶级专政，因此，廖沫沙在反对所谓“官僚主义”的旗帜下，疯狂地攻击无产阶级专政。
    一九五六年八月间，我们报纸上报道了一位医师所开的吃蝌蚪可以避孕的单方。廖沫沙抓住这样一个小小问题，用了一个煽动性的题目《活吞蝌蚪》，对无产阶级专政极尽诬蔑谩骂之能事。
    廖沫沙故意提出问题：“女工们活吞蝌蚪，会不会将其他寄生虫卵一起吞下去呢？”他煽动地回答说：“那还用说吗？全吞下去了，全吞下去了！”然后他挑衅性地问道：“可是谁应该负这个糟糕的责任呢？”他回答说：介绍这个单方的医生不应负责，抢先登载这个消息的报纸不应负责，卫生行政部门也不应负责。接着笔锋一转，把矛头直指党中央：“我这样一层层思考下去，自己也觉得茫茫然，……连个被告都没有了。如果讲责任，这个责任究竟该谁负呢？”“现在据我看：这个责任恐怕只好由那些活吞蝌蚪的可怜的女同胞们自己去负担了。——原案只好作无头公案处理，着即归档！”
    女人们吃蝌蚪避孕的这个责任，必须“一层层”追究下去，一直追到党中央。必须把党中央放在“被告”席上，否则，就是“无头公案”。
    廖沫沙的用意是多么恶毒！一位医生介绍了一种避孕的单方，有些女同志服用了。假如这个单方有缺点，那么只要加以说明，纠正就行了。如果不是站在敌对的阶级立场上，怎么会要追究党中央的责任呢？怎么竟去煽动“可怜”的“女同胞”去反对党中央呢？这不是十足的反革命煽动行为又是什么？
    一九五六年十二月，廖沫沙写了一篇《官僚主义的“下限”》，更是一支直接对准党中央的黑枪。他说，不能认为“天下最爱犯官僚主义毛病的”，只是些“官卑职小”的干部，“事实上官愈高，职权愈大”，沾染官僚主义的尘土也就“更厚更多”；因此，火力应该集中于“大官僚”，而不能让大官僚主义“逍遥于批评之外”。
    廖沫沙把伟大的毛泽东思想和无产阶级专政看作是反动的资产阶级知识分子的大难关，大灾难，因此，他“请士子们——也就是知识分子们——严重注意！”，“要逃脱这个难关”，“避免这场灾难”。
    廖沫沙公然叫嚣说：“‘圣人不死，大盗不止’。我现在发现：官僚不死，八股文不止！”廖沫沙根据他的反革命经验，他深深懂得，只有无产阶级专政完蛋了，他们这些反革命分子才能逃脱难关，避免灾难。
    告诉廖沫沙之流的反革命分子，无产阶级的伟大领袖万寿无疆，无产阶级的专政如铜墙铁壁一样坚固。不管你们多么狡猾，不管有什么人包庇你，你躲得了初一，过不了十五；反右派斗争叫你漏了网，但是，你们是无法逃脱无产阶级专政的法网的。
    “三家村”黑店进行反革命复辟的干将
    当“三家村”黑店在它的后台大老板指使下，向无产阶级大举进攻的时候，廖沫沙袒胸露腹，大吹法螺，拚死命地向我们扑来。他在一系列文章中，对我们伟大、光荣、正确的党，对党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，发动了猖狂进攻。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是我们一切事业取得胜利的根本保证，无产阶级专政，是我们传身护家的法宝。因此，廖沫沙这个顽固的反革命分子，便集中了一切仇恨，攻击、诋毁和诽谤伟大的毛泽东思想，积极活动，要推翻无产阶级专政，搞反革命复辟。
    一九五八年，全国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，发扬了冲天的革命干劲，实现了国民经济的飞跃发展。混入党内的资产阶级代理人——右倾机会主义者，诬蔑我们搞糟了，叫嚷要同我们“算帐”。我们党有力地批驳了右倾机会主义者对党的总路线的无耻诽谤。这时，廖沫沙跳了出来，在一九五九年《前线》第十三期上，放出了一株毒草《要学会算帐》。他虚伪地说，“我们不赞成这种‘秋后算帐派’”；但是，他紧接着来一个“但书”，说“如果只谈‘算帐’，我们不但不反对‘秋后’算帐，而且赞成‘秋前’也要算帐”，他气势汹汹地叫喊：“有帐必算”，“大帐小帐一齐算”。
    廖沫沙这个反革命分子同我们党斗争了几十年，现在他认为已到同我们“算总账”的时候了。
    “三家村”黑店的急先锋吴晗抛出大毒草《海瑞骂皇帝》之后，廖沫沙跟着杀将出来。一九六○年六月，他在《前线》抛出大毒草《论“太岁头上动土”》。廖沫沙捧出死人王充，歌颂他是“不怕冲撞‘太岁’的硬汉子”，“把‘圣贤之言’剥得不成样子”。读者一看就知道，这同吴晗吹捧海瑞敢于大骂“皇帝”，是一路黑货。廖沫沙是在鼓励人们敢于“冲撞”党中央，反对“独尊”毛泽东思想，要让反党反社会主义的“杂家”自由泛滥。
    “三家村”黑帮及其后台大老板认为，一九六一年春天是他们反革命复辟的大好形势的开始。一月一日，“三家村”黑帮总管邓拓，叫喊“春风袅娜”，向众牛鬼蛇神传下帅令：“听，春雷欲动，大野昭苏，辞旧岁，展雄图。趁良辰美景，同心戮力，坚持奋斗，切莫踌躇！”同月，反革命急先锋吴晗的《海瑞罢官》急速出笼。廖沫沙紧紧跟上，一月二十日，他在前《北京晚报》上，大擂战鼓，说“春，是要‘腊鼓’来催的”，“在春季就要开始大干”；并且大骂所谓“和大主教差不了多少”的“天子”。
    《海瑞罢官》掀起的一股妖风，冲昏了“三家村”黑帮们的头脑，他们觉得“天下大变”的时机到来了。三月九日，廖沫沙提出了一个反革命复辟的理论：《唯变所适论》。在发表时，廖沫沙觉得这个题目太露骨了，便改成：《孔子和〈周易〉作者是怎样观察“变革”的》，给反革命的理论披上了一层“学术”的外衣。廖沫沙采取了“三家村”黑帮所惯用的“以古讽今”的手法，发出了反革命复辟的狂吠。他说：“当时”（应读作现在）是“社会历史的大变化”的时代，而“孔子”则很“保守”，“一切都得照老样子”，“不能容纳任何新鲜事物”。
    廖沫沙大叫要反对“至死都不敢违反‘圣人’之言的历史传统”，他说：“人们面对这个‘变动不居’的世界，就只有一个方法：‘惟变所适’”。只要把这些话同当时的阶级斗争形势联系起来，同廖沫沙的那些反动言论联系起来，那么，他的用心就很清楚了。当时，叛徒赫鲁晓夫把他们那套修正主义当作马克思列宁主义的新发展，国内的阶级敌人则把“三和一少”、“三自一包”这套反革命谬论当作新鲜事物，而骂我们党是顽固的“保守派”，不愿意适应新形势。廖沫沙的“惟变所适”论，翻译成明白的语言，就是要人们适应他们的反革命“变革”，跟着他们这伙阴谋家跑。这是白日做梦！无产阶级是彻底的革命派，毛泽东思想是无产阶级最彻底的革命思想。无产阶级当然要变革，但是，我们所要的是革命的变革，对于牛鬼蛇神的所谓“变革”——反革命复辟活动——则要坚决粉碎。
    一九六一年六月至八月间，“三家村”黑店纠集了一批牛鬼蛇神，在后台大老板的指使下，刮起了一阵大黑风。
    廖沫沙在六月十日出版的《前线》上，发表了《调查和算帐》，鼓动牛鬼蛇神到基层去“算帐”，“既要查旧帐，又要算新帐”。不错，帐是要算的，我们要以其人之道还治其人之身，对于邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙之流，不仅要算新帐，而且要查旧帐，要新帐旧帐一起算！这篇文章的标题太露眼了，收入《分阴集》时，他偷偷地改为《从“无数”到“有数”》。
    接着，吴晗、邓拓向党向社会主义，射来了《明代民族英雄于谦》、《陈绛和王耿的案件》、《一个鸡蛋的家当》、《磨光了的金币》、《专治“健忘症”》等等“排炮”。八月十日，孟超的《李慧娘》、田汉的《谢瑶环》出笼。当这群“魔怪舞翩跹”的时候，廖沫沙在八月三十一日的前《北京晚报》上，放出了《有鬼无害论》，替妖魔鬼怪作护法，“鼓舞”牛鬼蛇神不要“屈服于压迫势力”，要“与压迫势力作斗争，敢于战胜压迫者”。
    马克思主义者坚决反对资产阶级对无产阶级的压迫，反对剥削者对被剥削者的压迫。同时，马克思主义者也必须坚持无产阶级专政，即坚持无产阶级对资产阶级的专政，被剥削阶级对剥削阶级的专政。在我国，地富反坏右是专政对象，无产阶级和劳动人民是专政者。在这种条件下，廖沫沙号召“与压迫势力作斗争”，这不是公开地号召地富反坏右起来同无产阶级和劳动人民作斗争，颠覆无产阶级专政吗？
    当国际国内牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，准备大干的时候，毛主席教导我们不要怕鬼，要开展一个打鬼运动。这怎能不叫廖沫沙之流的鬼蜮恼怒呢？廖沫沙在《怕鬼的“雅谑”》中反诬我们：鬼神一出来，你们就叫喊要打倒，可是你们是“怕鬼怕得要死的人”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命者，从来不怕鬼。我们敢于消灭一切妖焰鬼火，不管是洋鬼、土鬼、活鬼、死鬼，统统打倒，决不让“三家村”鬼群兴风作浪，推翻无产阶级专政，夺取无产阶级的天下。
    从一九六一年十月“三家村”黑店公开营业，到一九六二年党的八届十中全会前夕，国内阶级敌人的进攻最为疯狂。这时，“三家村”黑店也最放肆。“三家村”黑店急先锋吴晗狂呼，反革命的“浪头”将“越来越大”。“三家村”的总管邓拓则赤裸裸地说：共产党的“困难不但不会克服，反而会越来越多”，“大地很快就要解冻”。他们得意忘形，公开叫喊要我们党下台“休息”，他们加紧联络人，发展组织。
    但是，“三家村”黑帮及其后台大老板，对形势作了完全错误的估计。
    一九六二年九月，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，进一步阐明了关于社会主义社会阶级、阶级斗争的理论，并号召我们开展兴无灭资的阶级斗争。毛主席的教导，象一声春雷，惊醒了大地。“三家村”黑帮们的丧钟响了，不是什么“好光景就在眼前”，而是他们的末日到来了。
    廖沫沙大概也觉得他们的大势有点不妙，一九六三年七月，他发出《身后事该怎么办？》的哀鸣。
    共产党人为革命而生，为革命而死。一个革命者死了，千百个革命者站起来。个人死了，无产阶级的革命事业永垂不朽。那些干反革命勾当的人，一生干坏事，他们怕死了受人民的唾骂，因此提出：人死之后怎么办？
    怎么办呢？廖沫沙搬出了庄子的反动哲学来。他说：人死了，“万念俱消”，“朽骨、朽肉，化除腐朽，就算完事”，只要“对身后事看得如此明白”就行。我们告诉那些反革命的黑帮分子：决不是人死了，“万念俱消”，“就算完事”。为革命而死，永垂不朽；为反革命而死，遗臭万年。你们这套腐朽没落的哲学是骗不了人的。
    廖沫沙的反革命立场是顽固的。过了两个月，他又在《前线》上向牛鬼蛇神提出：《学游泳不要怕水》。他说：“学游泳的人都尝试过第一次被人推下水的滋味：一到水中，立即水深没颈，真使人惊慌失措。但是经过两次、三次、四次下水，就慢慢习惯了”。廖沫沙确是有反革命经验的人。从参加蒋介石的反共“围剿”到一九五六年的右派分子进攻，他也确实是经过“四次下水”了。他供认自己对于反革命勾当已经“习惯”了，并且告诉那些第一次“下水”的人，面对着向他们冲击的革命洪流，不要“惊慌失措”。但是，“三家村”的兄弟们只不过是表面镇定，实际上心慌得很。一切反动派都是纸老虎，他们是顽而不固。无产阶级专政的铁拳把他们砸得粉碎。
    廖沫沙一生的反革命活动，可以帮助人们懂得，这一场斗争决不是什么打笔墨官司，而是剑拔弩张、荷枪实弹的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，不是你死我活，就是你活我死，没有任何妥协的余地。
    叛徒，变节分子，帝国主义的奴才，蒋介石反动派的忠实走狗，——“三家村”这个反革命巢穴所麕集的就是这样一批黑色人物，前北京市委收罗、包庇、纵容的就是这样一群牛鬼蛇神。他们的目的，就是要把红色的中国变成黑色的中国。
    亲爱的读者们，象邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙这样的牛鬼蛇神，难道仅仅是在一个地方存在吗？别的地方就没有吗？不！“三家村”黑店固然是反革命复辟的重要巢穴；但是，象邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙之流的黑帮人物，决不仅仅是个别的现象，因为这是一个阶级对一个阶级的阶级斗争。因此，我们必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定要把牛鬼蛇神从各个阴暗的角落里统统揪出来，挖掉反革命复辟的根子，使无产阶级的革命红旗，千秋万代，永远飘扬在中国的大地上。
