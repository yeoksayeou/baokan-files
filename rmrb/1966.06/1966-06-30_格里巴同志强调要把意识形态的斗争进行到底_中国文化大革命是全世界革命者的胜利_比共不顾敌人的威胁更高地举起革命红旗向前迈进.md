	Comrade Grivas of the Belgian Communist Party recently emphasized in a report that the ideological struggle must be carried through to the end. He said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a victory for revolutionaries all over the world. The Belgian Communist Party, undaunted by the enemy's threats, is advancing while holding the revolutionary red flag higher.

	BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) — BRUSSELS — Belgian Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Grivas recently pointed out in a report: The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, have smashed the "Three Family Village" clique's rampant attacks. "This is a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists all over the world."

	Grivas also stressed that the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China are a powerful pillar of the world's people's revolution.

	This report by Grivas was presented and adopted at the meeting of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party held on June 12. The title of the report is "On Some New Factors in the Current Situation and the Tasks Arising Therefrom." The report was published in the June 17 issue of the Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly "Voice of the People."

	Grivas said in the report, "We know that in China, especially since the difficult years of 1960-1961, the 'Three Family Village' conspirators and other counter-revolutionaries have attacked the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people, attacked socialism and the Communist Party of China. In the difficult years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, waged a heroic, resolute, and victorious struggle against the consequences of natural disasters and the shameful betrayal and attacks of the Khrushchevites in collusion with imperialist aggression. The 'Three Family Village' conspirators and other counter-revolutionaries have been exposed. This is a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists all over the world, and it is also our victory. We must read and understand the recently published documents of great significance in ideology and politics on this matter. These documents are not only good education for our comrades in China but also for us."

	Grivas said, "Class struggle exists everywhere, and the enemy is active everywhere; if the experience of struggle in this or that country has its peculiarities, then generally speaking, this experience is of universal significance. We must seriously read and study the recent documents of the Communist Party of China on the socialist cultural revolution, the socialist educational movement, and the (criticism of the) 'Three Family Village.'"

	Grivas pointed out that since its reconstruction, the Belgian Communist Party has been subjected to various attacks both domestically and internationally. He said, "The enemy's activities are not only manifested in the activities of direct agents bought by the enemy but also in the words and deeds of those influenced by bourgeois ideology and those standing on anti-Marxist-Leninist positions.

	"We must always carry the ideological struggle within the party through to the end. We patiently and with the necessary firmness convince those who have been deceived. This struggle has consistently strengthened the party; struggle is a condition for strengthening the party. It has been proven that the party has been strengthened by purifying its ranks.

	"The enemy's threats and blows have not frightened us. We are advancing. The party is developing and is holding the revolutionary red flag higher and higher."

	Grivas, in discussing the current situation of the people's struggles in various countries, said that currently, "many events and victorious struggles of the people of various countries have appeared in the world, many victories have been achieved by Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, many victories have been achieved by the peoples of various nationalities in Belgium, and our party has also achieved many victories."

	He said, "The peoples of various countries have achieved victories, the class enemies and their leader, American imperialism, have suffered defeats, American imperialism has suffered one defeat after another, and it is becoming more and more isolated. The situation of the struggles of the peoples of various countries and the revolutionary forces is excellent."

	Grivas condemned American imperialism's continuous aggression against China and its occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan. He also condemned the Indian bourgeois reactionaries, instigated and supported by American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, who invaded the People's Republic of China.

	Grivas said, "We fully support the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China, this powerful pillar of the world's people's revolution. We must be prepared for all possible events: if American imperialism and its lackeys and Soviet revisionists dare to attack the People's Republic of China, thereby provoking a world war, we must be ready at any time to fulfill our duty as revolutionaries. The Chinese people and the united peoples of the world will annihilate American imperialism."

	The people of Belgium, holding up signs such as "NATO Get Out," demonstrated and marched in protest against American imperialism's attempt to move the headquarters of the North Atlantic aggression bloc to Belgium.

    格里巴同志强调要把意识形态的斗争进行到底
    中国文化大革命是全世界革命者的胜利
    比共不顾敌人的威胁更高地举起革命红旗向前迈进
    新华社二十八日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴最近在一个报告中指出：中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下粉碎了“三家村”黑帮分子的猖狂进攻，“这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利，这是全世界革命者和马克思列宁主义者的胜利”。
    格里巴还强调，中国人民和中华人民共和国是全世界人民革命的强大支柱。
    格里巴这个报告是在比利时共产党中央委员会六月十二日举行的会议上提出和由会议通过的，题目是《关于当前局势的某些新因素和由此而提出的任务》。这个报告刊载在六月十七日的比利时共产党机关刊物《人民之声》周刊上。
    格里巴在报告中说，“我们知道，在中国，特别是从一九六○——一九六一年困难年代开始，‘三家村’阴谋家以及其他反革命分子攻击了中国革命和中国人民，攻击了社会主义和中国共产党。在困难的年月中，中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，同由于自然灾害和与帝国主义侵略配合行动的赫鲁晓夫分子的无耻叛变和攻击所造成的后果，进行了英勇、坚决和胜利的斗争。‘三家村’阴谋家和其他反革命分子已被揭发。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利，这是全世界革命者和马克思列宁主义者的胜利，这也是我们的胜利。必须阅读和领会最近出版的在意识形态和政治方面具有重大意义的关于这方面的文件，这些文件不但对中国同志是很好的教育，对我们也是很好的教育。”
    格里巴说，“阶级斗争无处不存在，敌人到处在活动；如果说在这个国家或那个国家里的斗争经验有着特殊之处，那么，总的说来，这种经验也是具有普遍意义的。我们要认真阅读和学习中国共产党最近的关于社会主义文化大革命、关于社会主义教育运动和关于（批判）‘三家村’的文件。”
    格里巴指出，比利时共产党自从重建以来就受到国内外的各种攻击。他说，“敌人的活动不仅仅表现为被敌人收买的直接代理人进行的活动上，而且也表现在受资产阶级意识形态影响的那些人的言行上，和站在反马克思列宁主义立场上的人们的言行上。
      “我们始终要把党内的意识形态的斗争彻底地进行到底，我们耐心地、并且以必要的坚定态度说服那些受骗的人。这种斗争一贯加强了党；斗争就是加强党的一个条件。事实证明，党一直是通过纯洁党的队伍而得到加强的。
      “敌人的威胁和打击没有吓倒我们。我们正在向前迈进。党正在发展，并且越来越高地举起革命的红旗。”
    格里巴在谈到当前各国人民斗争的形势大好时说，当前“在世界上出现了许多事件和各国人民的胜利斗争，各个马克思列宁主义的党和组织获得了许多胜利，比利时各族人民取得了许多胜利，我们党也获得了许多胜利。”
    他说，“各国人民获得了胜利，阶级敌人及其头子美帝国主义遭到了失败，美帝国主义遭到了一个又一个的失败，它越来越孤立。各国人民的斗争和革命力量的形势大好。”
    格里巴谴责美帝国主义不断对中国进行侵略和霸占中国领土台湾。他还谴责受到美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的唆使和支持的印度资产阶级反动派对中华人民共和国的侵略。
    格里巴说，“我们完全支持中国人民和中华人民共和国这个全世界人民革命的强大支柱，我们必须作好准备应付一切可能发生的事件：如果美帝国主义及其仆从和苏联修正主义者胆敢进攻中华人民共和国，从而挑起世界战争，我们必须随时准备履行我们革命者的义务，中国人民和同心协力的全世界人民就将把美帝国主义消灭掉。”
    比利时人民高举“北大西洋公约组织滚出去”等标语牌示威游行，愤怒反对美帝国主义要把北大西洋侵略集团总部迁到比利时去。
