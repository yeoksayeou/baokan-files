    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 2nd: Chairman Sanzo Nosaka of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and Chairman Kozo Sasaki of the Japanese Socialist Party delivered speeches on the evening of June 1st at a rally in Yokosuka's seaside park attended by approximately 35,000 people protesting the entry of American nuclear submarines into Japan. This rally was the second held in this city on the 1st, and it demonstrated the soaring fighting spirit of the Japanese people against American imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces.

    Chairman Sanzo Nosaka said in his speech at the rally that the Japanese people are fighting for Japan's independence and peace, but not solely for the benefit of the Japanese people. He emphasized that in this struggle, the Japanese people are fulfilling their obligations to the great struggle of the Asian people for national liberation and peace.

    Nosaka also emphasized that we, the Japanese people, must carry the struggle through to the end in order to fulfill our obligations to the Asian people and the people of the world. To ensure the victory of this struggle, Nosaka called for all democratic forces to unite closely in this fight.

    Socialist Party Chairman Sasaki said that the rally is not only a struggle against the entry of American nuclear submarines, but also an integral part of the struggle to remove all American military bases in Japan and to achieve Japan's complete independence.

    At the end of the rally, all participants held a demonstration in downtown Yokosuka. They shouted, "Yankees go home!"

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 1st: People from all walks of life across Japan have recently held mass rallies and demonstrations in Yokosuka, angrily protesting the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka.

    Approximately 5,000 workers, citizens, and farmers from various prefectures in the Kanto region and from Mie, Nagano, Toyama, Niigata, Aomori, and other prefectures in eastern Japan braved the rain on the afternoon of June 1st to hold a high-spirited mass rally and demonstration in Yokosuka, protesting the intrusion of American nuclear submarines into the port.

    Kanichi Kawakami, head of the Japanese Communist Party's Diet delegation, condemned the Sato government for actively assisting American imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam. He called on the participants to further unite and launch a more powerful struggle.

    Tomi Narita, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, said that the victory of the united action of democratic forces against the entry of American nuclear submarines into Yokosuka is a blow to American imperialism and its shameless accomplice, the Sato Cabinet.

    Meanwhile, the Japanese public also organized two maritime demonstrations in Yokosuka today, in the morning and afternoon respectively. Workers participated in the demonstrations on nine ships, sailing close to the American nuclear submarines and American warships anchored in the port, raising their arms and angrily shouting slogans such as "Nuclear submarines go home!" and "Yankees go home!"
