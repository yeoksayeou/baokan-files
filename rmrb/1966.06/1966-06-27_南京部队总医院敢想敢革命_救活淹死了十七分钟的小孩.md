People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Region General Hospital medical and nursing staff, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, with a strong proletarian spirit, revived a child who had been drowned for at least seventeen minutes.

On March 31st in the afternoon, Nanjing City tricycle worker Liu Huaiyu's six-year-old son Liu Chunbao was playing by the Qinhuai River and accidentally fell into the water. When Chunbao was brought ashore and sent to the Nanjing Military Region General Hospital, he had stopped breathing and his heart had stopped beating for at least seventeen minutes. Reviving a person who had drowned was a difficult problem in modern medicine. The hospital, from the leadership to the military doctors and nurses, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving the people, displayed a daring spirit of innovation, and decided to use every possible means to overcome the difficulties in the medical field and save the child's life from the brink of death.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's teachings on "saving the dying and helping the injured, practicing revolutionary humanitarianism," the on-duty military doctors Jiang Jiaping, Fu Erjie, and nurse Chen Yin immediately began rescuing Chunbao. Some performed external cardiac massage, while others injected a stimulant. Military doctor Jiang Jiaping performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Chunbao, and a foul smell rushed into his nostrils, but he continued without hesitation. After five minutes of continuous rescue, Chunbao's heartbeat and breathing still did not recover. The medical staff were about to open his chest for direct cardiac massage when a military doctor listened closely to the child's chest and suddenly heard a faint heartbeat. The doctors immediately decided to stop the chest surgery and continue external massage. Soon, the child took his first breath with the help of artificial respiration.

At that time, all the staff in the hospital were listening to the introduction of Jiao Yulu's deeds. The news of rescuing the child spread to the meeting. The hospital leaders and military doctors from the anesthesia department, pediatric department, surgery department, and internal medicine department quickly rushed to the emergency room. The hospital leaders and medical staff discussed and decided on the spot to assign personnel to form a rescue team, carry forward the spirit of revolutionary humanitarianism, and definitely save the life of this child of the working people. Deputy Director of Anesthesia Li Dexin continued external cardiac massage and positive pressure assisted breathing with everyone, and at the same time, adopted a series of measures such as lowering body temperature, dehydration, and anti-acidification to prevent brain cell necrosis, brain edema, and acidosis due to hypoxia. The rescue lasted for four hours and twenty minutes, and Chunbao's heartbeat and spontaneous breathing gradually recovered. His skin also turned from purple-black to a healthy red.

The first critical phase of saving the child's life had been overcome. However, that night, Li Dexin noticed that there was a "wet rale" in the patient's lungs, which was a sign of pulmonary edema. How to control pulmonary edema in drowning patients was a problem that had not been solved in the medical field at home and abroad. Li Dexin thought: since the patient's breathing would cause the development of pulmonary edema, could we temporarily stop the patient's spontaneous breathing, prevent pulmonary edema from developing freely, and control it before it worsens? However, such treatment had no successful precedents in clinical medicine and was a risky thing to do. Li Dexin thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly, and Jiao Yulu's deeds of being a hero in the face of difficulties, and decided to blaze a trail where none had gone before and bring the child back to life. He shared his thoughts with the doctors, and after careful and detailed discussion, everyone agreed.

The intense battle to control pulmonary edema began. The nurse injected a sedative into the child's vein, and his spontaneous breathing slowed down and gradually stopped. The medical staff maintained the child's life with artificial respiration while continuously using diuretics and blood pressure-lowering drugs to increase urine output and keep the blood pressure below 90 mmHg. By dawn, Chunbao's "wet rale" had disappeared, and the sputum drawn from his trachea had turned yellow, indicating that the stubborn pulmonary edema had been controlled by the fearless red medical staff.

After two days and two nights of intense rescue, Chunbao finally passed the critical period. He stayed in the general hospital for two weeks and fully recovered his health, and was discharged on April 13th. When he was discharged, the child's father Liu Huaiyu, with tears in his eyes, said to everyone: "Chunbao came in dead and went out alive. I am grateful for the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. The PLA is truly a good example of serving the people!"

### 南京部队总医院敢想敢革命  救活淹死了十七分钟的小孩

    南京部队总医院敢想敢革命
    救活淹死了十七分钟的小孩
    新华社南京二十五日电　人民解放军南京部队总医院医护人员，用毛泽东思想挂帅，怀着强烈的无产阶级感情，救活了一个落水淹死至少十七分钟的小孩。
    三月三十一日下午，南京市三轮车工人刘怀玉六岁多的儿子刘春宝在秦淮河边玩耍，不慎失足落水。当春宝被救上岸来，送到南京部队总医院时，他停止心跳和呼吸至少已有十七分钟了。把这样一个淹死的人救活，这是现代医学上的一个难题。这个医院从领导到军医、护士，遵循毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，发扬敢想敢闯的革命精神，决心千方百计突破医学领域里的难题，从死亡线上夺回孩子的生命。
    在毛主席“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的教导鼓舞下，值班军医蒋嘉萍、傅尔杰和护士陈银立即对春宝进行抢救，有的进行胸外心脏按摩，有的注射强心剂。军医蒋嘉萍嘴对嘴地给春宝做人工呼吸时，一股腥臭味冲进了他的鼻管，他毫不犹豫地继续做下去。连续抢救了五分钟以后，春宝的心跳和呼吸还不见恢复。医护人员们正准备打开胸腔直接按摩心脏，有个军医又一次伏到小孩身上侧耳细听，突然听到了一下微弱的心跳。军医们当即决定停止开胸手术，继续进行胸外按摩。不久，孩子终于在人工呼吸帮助下呼出了第一口气。
    这时，全院同志正在听焦裕禄事迹的介绍。抢救孩子的消息传到了会场上，医院领导同志和麻醉科、小儿科、外科、内科的军医们很快赶到了急诊室。医院领导与医护人员一起商讨研究，当场决定抽调专人组成抢救组，发扬救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，一定要千方百计救活这个劳动人民的儿子。麻醉科副主任李德馨一面和大家一起继续做胸外按摩和加压辅助呼吸，一面针对死亡时间较久的情况，采取降温、脱水和抗酸等一系列措施，防止大脑因缺氧而造成脑细胞坏死、脑水肿和酸中毒。抢救持续了四小时二十几分钟，春宝的心跳和自主呼吸终于逐渐恢复，他的皮肤也由紫黑色慢慢变得红润起来。
    抢救孩子生命的第一关闯过来了。可是当天深夜，李德馨觉察到病人肺里传出了“湿罗音”，这是危险的肺水肿征兆。如何制服水淹患者的肺水肿，这是国内外医学界没有解决的问题。李德馨想：既然病人的呼吸会导致肺水肿的发展，那么能不能暂时停止病人的自主呼吸，不让肺水肿任意发展，把它制服在严重恶化以前呢？但是，这样的处置在临床医学上还没有成功的先例，是件担风险的事。李德馨想起毛主席完全、彻底地为人民服务的教导和焦裕禄同志在困难面前逞英雄的事迹，决心走出一条前人没有走成的道路，把孩子的生命夺回来。他对医生们说出了自己的想法，大家经过认真细致的研究一致表示同意。
    制服肺水肿的紧张战斗开始了。护士把镇静剂注射到孩子的静脉里，他的自主呼吸就由快变慢，逐渐停止了。医护人员用人工呼吸维持孩子的生命，同时又不断地使用利尿和降血压的药物，增加尿量，使收缩血压保持在九十毫米汞柱以下。到天亮的时候，春宝肺里的“湿罗音”已经消失，从气管里抽出来的痰液也变成黄色，这些说明，顽固的肺水肿已经被无畏的红色医护人员制服了。
    经过两天两夜紧张的抢救，春宝终于脱离了危险期。他在总医院整整住了两个星期，完全恢复了健康，在四月十三日出了院。出院时，孩子的父亲刘怀玉热泪盈眶地对大家说：“春宝死的进来，活着出去，感谢党和毛主席的恩情。解放军真不愧是为人民服务的好榜样！”
