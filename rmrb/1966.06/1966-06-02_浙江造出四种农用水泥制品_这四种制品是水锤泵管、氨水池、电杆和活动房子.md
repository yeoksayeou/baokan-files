    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou - Relevant departments in Zhejiang Province have recently manufactured four economical and practical cement products for agriculture: cement water hammer pump pipes, cement ammonia water pools, thin-walled steel wire cement poles, and prefabricated cement houses.
    The steel wire mesh cement pipe, jointly produced by the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Water Conservancy Science and the Xin'anjiang Cement Products Factory, is both seepage-resistant and impact-resistant. Compared with welded steel pipes, it saves two-thirds of the steel and reduces the cost by about 60%. It can be used as the inlet and outlet pipe of a water hammer pump, and can be used within a range of a water head of 3 meters and a head of 100 meters.
    In the past, steel plates were used to build ammonia water pools. Building an ammonia water pool with a capacity of 50 tons required more than 4 tons of steel plates. The ammonia water pool recently built by the supply and marketing departments of Jinhua area in Zhejiang Province uses only 350 kilograms of steel plates, reducing the cost by 60%. It can use local rubble, pebbles, and blue bricks to build the pool body, and general production teams can build it.
    The six-meter-long thin-walled steel wire cement pole newly manufactured by the Hangzhou Cement Products Factory is suitable for rural lighting low-voltage lines and general communication lines, and is convenient for transportation and installation. The entire pole weighs 150 kilograms, which is 60% lighter than the smallest eight-meter cement pole previously produced by the factory, using 80% less steel and reducing the cost by more than half.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Building Science and the Linping Shipyard jointly designed and trial-produced a batch of prefabricated cement components for building rural houses. These components include beams, columns, and rafters. Their advantage is that they save materials and are low in cost. Using this set of components, a 100-square-meter house can be built in just half a day.

    浙江造出四种农用水泥制品
    这四种制品是水锤泵管、氨水池、电杆和活动房子
    新华社杭州电　浙江省有关部门最近为农业制造出四种经济实用的水泥制品——水泥水锤泵管、水泥氨水池、薄壁钢丝水泥电杆和水泥活动房子。
    浙江省水利科学研究所和新安江水泥制品厂共同制成的钢丝网水泥管，既能抗渗，又能抗冲击。同焊接钢管相比，钢材节约三分之二，造价低百分之六十左右。它可以用来作水锤泵的进出水管，在水头三米以内、扬程一百米以下的范围之内都可以使用。
    以往，造氨水池要用钢板。造一个五十吨容量的氨水池，需要四吨多钢板。浙江省金华地区供销部门新近用水泥造成的氨水池，钢板只要三百五十公斤，造价低百分之六十。它可以利用当地的块石、卵石、青砖等砌池身，一般生产队都能建造。
    杭州水泥制品厂新制成的六米长的薄壁钢丝水泥电杆，适用于农村照明低压线路和一般通讯线路，运输、安装比较方便。整根电杆重一百五十公斤，比这个厂过去生产的最小的八米水泥电杆重量轻六成，钢材少用八成，造价低一半多。
    浙江省建筑科学研究所和临平造船厂共同设计和试制成功一批建筑农村房屋的水泥预制构件。这批构件包括梁、柱、椽。它们好处是用料省，造价低。用这套构件，只要半天时间就可以搭盖起一百平方米的住房。
