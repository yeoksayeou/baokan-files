    Mountain Songs Sing Praises of the Party
    Anhui Congyang Female Commune Member Wu Shilan displays the red flag, and the world is new; I sing mountain songs to thank the Party's kindness; a thousand-year-old bitter tree is uprooted, and happy flowers bloom for ten thousand springs. Dark clouds dissipate, and the rising sun is red; birds change their feathers, and fish change their scales; in the past, I was a poor girl, but now I have become a new commune farmer. Lotus leaves in the pond are round like plates, each plate holding a red lotus flower; red lotus leaves and jade lotus roots, the Party and the people are closely linked. The East Sea is wide, and the Yangtze River is long, the Party's kindness will never be forgotten; thousands of mountains and rivers resound with songs, mountain songs sing praises of the Party in every line.

    山歌句句歌唱党
    安徽枞阳女社员　吴仕兰红旗一展天地新，我唱山歌谢党恩；千年苦树连根拔，幸福花开万年春。乌云消散旭日红，鸟换羽毛鱼换鳞；过去我是穷丫头，今成公社新农民。池中荷叶圆似盘，盘盘托出红花莲，红莲绿叶连玉藕，党和人民紧相连。东海宽呀长江长，党的恩情永难忘，千山万水歌声起，山歌句句歌唱党。
