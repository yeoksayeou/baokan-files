    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 19) Washington dispatch: US President Johnson, at a press conference held at the White House on the 18th, while touting "peace talks," blatantly engaged in war blackmail against the Vietnamese people. He yelled that the US's "goals have not changed" in its aggression against Vietnam and that it is determined to "go all the way" in Vietnam.

    Johnson stated that in order to achieve the US's "goals" of occupying South Vietnam, the US will continue to send more troops to South Vietnam, intensify its attacks on the South Vietnamese people, and accelerate the bombing of North Vietnam. He revealed that in order to accelerate the expansion of the war, the US Department of Defense is trying to speed up the procurement of weapons.

    However, his war cries could not hide his inner panic. He admitted that the South Vietnamese puppet regime was extremely unstable. He said that due to infighting among various factions, "we can expect" that South Vietnam will "continue to experience turmoil." He also admitted that "there are indeed differences" between the American masters and the South Vietnamese puppets. At this press conference, Johnson also reiterated the need to intensify collusion with the Soviet Union. In this regard, he mentioned the recent Soviet catering to the US proposal for a so-called "international treaty" on the peaceful use of the moon and other celestial bodies. He expressed hope that this proposal "will receive careful consideration and be something beneficial." He also said that the United States "welcomes" "any expression" from the Soviet side on this issue at any time.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 16) Washington dispatch: US President Johnson, in a speech on the 15th, repeatedly expressed that he saw "encouraging signs" from the Soviet side regarding the prospects for strengthening US-Soviet collusion. He called on other Western countries to seize the opportunity and strive to seek "common understanding" with the Soviet revisionist clique, to establish a so-called East-West "cooperation" and "interdependence" relationship, so that everyone can promote the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union.

    He blatantly said at a gathering at the White House that the West "must constantly seek areas of understanding with the East," and "I hope to take the lead in this regard." He said, "Our own attitude towards the East is clear," "We will encourage every constructive step that promotes personnel, cultural and commercial ties between Eastern Europe and the West." He said, "We have been working along this line for some time. We will continue to do so."

    He said that "new possibilities for reaching understanding and establishing cooperation" with the Soviet Union are gradually replacing past differences, "So let us strive to realize these possibilities that are close at hand, and strive to create new opportunities at any time." He also said, "We will also take some new steps as we consult with our allies in the coming days. We are determined not to terminate our efforts because of difficulties and many setbacks."

    Johnson emphasized that the US will continue to pursue a "soft" approach towards the Soviet Union from a position of "strength," insisting on establishing a US-Soviet cooperative relationship based on American principles. He said, "We must maintain strength," "insist on our obligations," and "be unequivocal and certain about our principles."

    约翰逊又叫嚷要在南越“干到底”
    鼓吹加紧美苏勾结促进苏联和平演变
    据新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十八日在白宫举行的记者招待会上，一面鼓吹“和谈”，一面露骨地对越南人民进行战争讹诈。他叫嚷，美国侵略越南的“目标没有改变”，决心在越南“干到底”。
    约翰逊表示，为了实现美国侵占南越的“目标”，美国将继续向南越增派军队，加强对南越人民的进攻和加紧轰炸越南北方。他透露，为了加紧扩大战争，美国国防部正在设法加快武器采购的速度。
    但是，他的战争叫嚣掩饰不了他内心的惶恐。他承认，南越傀儡统治极其不稳。他说，由于各个派别互相倾轧，“我们可以料想”南越还会“继续发生动荡”。他也承认，在美国主子和南越傀儡之间“的确有分歧”。在这次记者招待会上，约翰逊还再次表示要加紧同苏联勾结。在这方面，他提到了最近苏联迎合美国提出的所谓和平利用月球和其他天体的“国际条约”的建议。他表示希望这个建议“会得到仔细的考虑和成为有益的东西”。他还说，美国“欢迎”苏联方面在这个问题上随时作出的“任何表示”。
    据新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十五日发表谈话，对加强美苏勾结的前景，一再表示他从苏联方面看到“令人鼓舞的迹象”。他号召其他西方国家也要不失时机，努力谋求同苏联修正主义集团的“共同了解”，建立所谓东西方“合作”和“相互依赖”的关系，大家来促进苏联的和平演变。
    他在白宫的一个集会上露骨地说，西方“必须不断地寻求和东方达成谅解的领域”，“我希望在这方面起带头作用”。他说，“我们自己对东方的姿态是清楚的”，“我们将鼓励促进东欧和西方的人员、文化和商业联系的每一个建设性步骤。”他说，“一个时期以来我们一直按照这个路线工作。我们将继续这样做”。
    他说，和苏联“达成谅解和建立合作的新的可能性”正在逐渐代替过去的分歧，“因此，让我们努力来实现近在眼前的这些可能性，并且努力随时创造新的机会。”他还说，“在我们在今后若干天内同我们的盟国进行磋商时，我们还将采取一些新的步骤。我们决心不因为遇到困难和产生许多挫折而终止我们的努力。”
    约翰逊强调，美国对苏联加紧推行“软”的一手仍将继续从“实力”出发，坚持按照美国的原则来建立美苏合作的关系。他说，“我们必须维持强大”，“坚持我们的义务”，并且“对我们的原则是肯定无疑的，是确信无疑的”。
