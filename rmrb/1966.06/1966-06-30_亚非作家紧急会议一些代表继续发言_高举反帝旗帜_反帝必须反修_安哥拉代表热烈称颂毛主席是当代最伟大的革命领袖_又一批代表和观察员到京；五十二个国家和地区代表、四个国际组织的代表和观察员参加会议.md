Some representatives at the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers continued to speak today. They raised the banner of anti-imperialism and emphasized that to fight imperialism, one must also fight revisionism. The Angolan representative passionately praised Chairman Mao as the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. Another batch of representatives and observers arrived in Beijing; representatives and observers from 52 countries and regions, and four international organizations participated in the conference.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, June 29th — Some representatives from Asian and African countries pointed out at the plenary session of the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers held today: Writers from Asian and African countries must further expand the united front against American imperialism, raise the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, and together with the people of all countries, carry the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys through to the end. The representatives pointed out that to fight imperialism, one must fight revisionism. The idea that one can defeat imperialism without fighting revisionism is a serious illusion.

	Some representatives also emphasized that in the face of imperialist violence, without armed struggle against imperialism, there can be no true national liberation; without national liberation, there can be no true national cultural prosperity.

	Representatives from Angola, Cambodia, Laos, Sudan, Japan, and Indonesia gave reports at today's plenary session.

	Angolan representative Viriato da Cruz, in his report, passionately praised Chairman Mao Zedong as the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. He said: African and Asian writers, through serious study of Mao Zedong Thought, can grasp a weapon even more powerful than the atomic bomb.

	He said: This weapon can completely, thoroughly, and entirely annihilate imperialism and revisionism.

	Da Cruz pointed out that every revolutionary must correctly acknowledge that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the most complete and faithful reflections of our era.

	He said: Mao Zedong Thought scientifically and comprehensively summarizes the struggles of the Chinese people and the people of the world, formulating correct policies, strategies, and tactics for the major issues of the world revolution that are in line with our era.

	Da Cruz emphasized in his report that the aggressive nature of imperialism led by the United States has not changed in the slightest. Soviet modern revisionism advocates that oppressed peoples should "peacefully coexist" with imperialism, proving that it is the biggest lackey of American imperialism.

	Da Cruz said, just as Mao Zedong said, "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear." To uphold and spread the truth, we Asian and African writers should expose, condemn, and oppose modern revisionism. If we do not resolutely carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership to the end, then in any place, imperialism cannot be truly defeated. He emphasized that the idea that one can defeat imperialism without fighting revisionism is a serious illusion.

	Da Cruz strongly condemned in his report the brutal suppression and shameless cultural aggression of American imperialism in various Asian and African countries. He said, Asian and African writers bear an irresponsible and heavy historical responsibility, which is to awaken, mobilize, and organize the masses of the people, and to carry the struggle against imperialism to the end without compromise.

	He said, imperialism will never voluntarily retire from the historical stage. Imperialism never gives up violence; by its nature, it will only use violence. The result is that imperialism has made us understand that armed struggle is the main form of anti-imperialist struggle. Loyal Asian and African writers should remind the masses of this truth.

	Da Cruz said, to oppose imperialism, we must remove the obstacles from the people's path of progress, which are the revisionist fallacies of "peaceful transition," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful coexistence." He fiercely denounced the Soviet modern revisionists' clamor and conspiracy of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world." He also emphasized the need to oppose imperialist and modern revisionist literature. Just as Chairman Mao said, "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." To build, one must destroy; to open up the path for the literature of the Asian and African peoples, one must demolish the obstacles, that is, imperialist and revisionist literature.

	He expressed his belief that this emergency conference will further unite Asian and African writers, establish a great army of revolutionary culture in Asia and Africa, and truly form the broadest revolutionary front of Asian and African writers. The fighting goal of this cultural army is to support the armed struggle of the Asian and African peoples. He finally passionately shouted, "Long live our teacher and comrade-in-arms, Mao Zedong!" At this moment, the entire audience stood up and gave thunderous, unending applause.

	Cambodian representative team leader Cheng Huian said in his report that the people of the world support their Vietnamese brothers standing on the front line of the anti-American struggle, which is the responsibility of every man and woman with a sense of justice. For Asian and African writers, we have the responsibility to make the people of all countries in the world understand the various crimes committed by American imperialism and the significance of our struggle to maintain independence and rid ourselves of foreign rule.

	He condemned the use of culture and art by imperialism led by the United States and old and new colonialism to cover up their crimes of aggression. He said, we Asian and African writers should oppose all the deception, slander, and boasting tricks of American imperialism.

	He expressed his complete support for the struggle against imperialist cultural aggression. He said: Imperialist culture has destroyed our national culture and replaced it with the most decadent American culture of slaughter, brutality, money madness, racism, obscenity, and alcoholism. He said, we must resist this disaster.

	Laotian representative team leader Ou Damajunamani said in his report that American imperialism has committed the most barbaric and inhuman crimes in Vietnam. However, the heroic and indomitable Vietnamese people have given the American bandits and their lackeys a crushing blow. The victory of the Vietnamese people has shown the world that the American aggressors appear strong but are actually weak. We should enthusiastically welcome and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. He said, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation is supporting our own people's struggle.

	He severely condemned the aggressive crimes of American imperialism in Laos. He said, American imperialism is plotting new and extremely dangerous military adventures. They are intensifying "special warfare" in Laos and plan to send ground troops to occupy central and southern Laos, inciting their Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys to further provoke the Kingdom of Cambodia. Facing the new adventurist activities of American imperialism, the Laotian people will fight more resolutely to the end, thoroughly defeating the imperialist plot of aggression.

	Sudanese representative team leader Osman Hassan Ahmed said in his report that on the stage of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in Africa, apart from American imperialists, a new enemy has emerged, that is, the modern revisionists centered on the new leadership of the CPSU. Modern revisionists are doing their utmost to make the African people deviate from their main struggle and try to extinguish the flames of the African revolution. They are doing their best to serve the imperialists led by the United States, and they are the true lackeys of imperialism. He pointed out that the modern revisionists centered on the new leadership of the Soviet Union have always supported the Vietnamese people verbally, but in fact, they have been trading the blood and lives of the Vietnamese people with American imperialism.

	Osman, when talking about the development of national culture in Asian and African countries, emphasized that the pen of writers should be used in the struggle against imperialists and their lackeys. The urgent task of writers is to expose those traitors, making the people of the world clearly understand who their friends are, who their enemies are, who the true splitters are, and who values and defends the revolutionary movement.

	Osman said, the war of the people of South Vietnam against American imperialist aggression is an example for the people of Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. It proves that true independence, freedom, and sovereignty cannot be obtained through negotiations or begging, as some Marxist-Leninist traitors claim.

	Japanese representative team member Shimo Masatsugu said in his report that Japanese writers are opposing American imperialist cultural aggression and are fighting for Japanese national democratic culture. This struggle is indispensable for the true liberation and independence of the Japanese people. He condemned that American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries fear the power of the united Japanese people, so they further strengthened their cultural and ideological attacks to destroy the unity of the people and undermine the fighting will of the people from an ideological standpoint.

	Shimo Masatsugu, when talking about the persecution of Japanese progressive cultural workers by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and its lackeys is becoming stronger and stronger.

	Indonesian representative Lisagoda reported to the conference that Asian and African writers should thoroughly unite with the working people of their own countries and the people of the world, fight against the number one enemy, American imperialism, fight against modern revisionists, strive for complete national independence, and develop people's culture.

	He said, our era is one where the people demand that writers serve the revolution wholeheartedly, and demand that Asian and African writers further consolidate their fighting unity to smash imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the remnants of feudalism. The attacks and split activities against the Asian and African writers' movement not only come from imperialism and its running dogs but also from their defenders. At this moment, Asian and African writers are fiercely fighting to strike at the culprits of the Cairo split conference—the Soviet splitters.

	He said, Asian and African writers should hold the pen and shoulder the gun to fight.

	He angrily exposed and analyzed the reactionary nature of American imperialist decadent literature and the traitorous literature of Soviet modern revisionism. He said, although the imperialists and their "fifth column" try their best to create a countercurrent in some Asian and African countries, they will only meet with one failure after another, one setback after another, until they are completely annihilated. This countercurrent cannot stop the flourishing development of the fighting literature of the Asian and African peoples.

	Lisagoda, in his report, enthusiastically praised the great proletarian cultural revolution that is vigorously underway in China and its great significance. He said, hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers are directly participating in this cultural revolution. It has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' fantasy of pulling China's historical wheel back to the dark ages that have passed and completely smashed the hopes of American imperialism and its lackeys to seize the younger generation of China. The hundreds of millions of Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are vigorously carrying out the cultural revolution, will certainly enrich and strengthen the fighting spirit and fighting spirit of Chinese literature. It can be said that this is not only significant for China but also has international significance.

	He emphasized that as long as imperialism led by the United States has not been completely annihilated, the national independence and literary development of Asia and Africa will always be threatened. Asian and African writers must unite with the people of their own countries and the people of the world to completely fight the revolutionary struggle to defeat the dying American imperialism. He emphasized that if we do not maintain a high degree of vigilance against revisionism, we will not be able to achieve victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. Only by fighting against modern revisionism—the twin brother of imperialism—can we successfully carry out the task of smashing imperialism led by the United States.

	Today's meeting read the congratulatory telegram from Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to this conference.

	Today's morning meeting was chaired by representatives from Jordan, North Korea, Laos, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), and the Comoros Islands. The afternoon meeting was chaired by representatives from Malaya, Nepal, Syria, Ghana, Guinea, and Mozambique.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, June 29th — Another batch of foreign representatives and international organization observers participating in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers arrived in Beijing by plane tonight. So far, representatives and observers from 52 countries and regions and four international organizations have participated in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers.

    亚非作家紧急会议一些代表继续发言
    高举反帝旗帜  反帝必须反修
    安哥拉代表热烈称颂毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖
    又一批代表和观察员到京；五十二个国家和地区代表、四个国际组织的代表和观察员参加会议
    新华社二十九日讯　一些亚非国家代表今天在亚非作家紧急会议全体会议上指出：亚非各国作家必须进一步扩大反美统一战线，高举反帝反殖的旗帜，同各国人民一起把反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争进行到底。代表们指出，要反帝必须反修，认为不反对修正主义也可以打败帝国主义，这是严重的幻想。
    有的代表还强调说：在帝国主义的暴力面前，不进行反帝的武装斗争，就不可能有真正的民族解放；没有民族解放，就不可能有真正的民族文化繁荣。
    在今天的全体会议上作报告的有：安哥拉、柬埔寨、老挝、苏丹、日本、印度尼西亚六国的代表。
    安哥拉代表维里亚托·达克鲁斯在报告中，热烈称颂毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖。他说：非洲和亚洲的作家通过认真学习毛泽东思想，能够掌握比原子弹更为强大的武器。
    他说：这种武器能够彻底地、全面地、完全地消灭帝国主义和修正主义。
    达克鲁斯指出，每一个革命者都应该正确地承认马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是我们时代最完全的和最忠实的反映。
    他说：毛泽东思想科学地和全面地总结了中国人民和世界人民的斗争，制订了正确地符合我们时代的世界革命大问题的政策、战略和策略。
    达克鲁斯在报告中强调指出，以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略本性丝毫未变，苏联现代修正主义鼓吹被压迫人民同帝国主义“和平共处”，证明它是美帝国主义的最大的帮凶。
    达克鲁斯说，正象毛泽东所说的，“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明。”为了坚持和传播真理，我们亚非作家应该揭露、谴责和反对现代修正主义。如果不坚决地把反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行到底，那末在任何地方都不能真正地战胜帝国主义。他强调指出，认为不反对修正主义也可以打败帝国主义，这是严重的幻想。
    达克鲁斯在报告中强烈谴责了美帝国主义在亚非各国进行疯狂的血腥镇压和肆无忌惮的文化侵略。他说，亚非作家肩负着不可推卸的重大历史责任，那就是唤醒、动员和组织人民大众，把反对帝国主义的斗争毫不妥协地进行到底。
    他说，帝国主义永远也不会自动退出历史舞台。帝国主义从不放弃暴力，就其本性而言，它只会采用暴力。其结果是帝国主义使我们懂得了武装斗争是反帝斗争的主要形式。忠于真理的亚非作家应该提醒人民群众记住这一真理。
    达克鲁斯说，为了反对帝国主义，我们要扫除人民前进道路上的绊脚石，这就是修正主义的关于“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”、“和平共处”的谬论。他痛斥了苏联现代修正主义者的“美苏合作主宰世界”的叫嚣和阴谋。他还强调必须反对帝国主义和现代修正主义文艺。正象毛泽东主席所说“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。要立就要破，要为亚非人民的文艺开辟道路，就必须摧毁障碍，即帝国主义和修正主义文艺。
    他表示相信，这次紧急会议将进一步团结亚非作家，建立亚非革命文化大军，真正地组成最广泛的亚非作家革命阵线。这支文化大军的斗争目的正是要支援亚非人民武装斗争。他最后热情地高呼：“我们的导师和战友毛泽东万岁！”这时全场起立，发出雷鸣般的经久不息的掌声。
    柬埔寨代表团团长郑璜在报告中说，世界人民支持站在反美斗争前线的越南兄弟，这是每一个有正义感的男女的责任。对于亚非作家来说，我们有责任使全世界各国人民了解美帝国主义所犯下的各种罪行和我们大家为维护独立、摆脱外国统治而进行的战斗的意义。
    他谴责以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义利用文化艺术试图掩盖他们的侵略罪行。他说，我们亚非作家应当反对美帝国主义的一切欺骗、污蔑和吹嘘的诡计。
    他表示完全支持反对帝国主义文化侵略的斗争。他说：帝国主义的文化破坏了我们的民族文化而代之以屠杀、残暴、金钱狂、种族主义、诲淫诲盗和酗酒等最腐朽的美国文明。他说，我们应当抵制这种灾难。
    老挝代表团团长乌达马·朱拉马尼在报告中说，美帝国主义在越南犯下了最野蛮和最不人道的罪行。但是，英雄的不屈不挠的越南人民给予美国强盗及其仆从以毁灭性的打击。越南人民的胜利向全世界表明，美国侵略者表面上是强大的，而实际上是虚弱的。我们应该热烈欢呼和支持越南人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争。他说，支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，就是支持我们本国人民的斗争。
    他严厉谴责了美帝国主义在老挝的侵略罪行。他说，美帝国主义正阴谋进行新的极端危险的军事冒险。他们在老挝加紧扩大“特种战争”，并且要派遣地面部队占领中下寮，唆使其泰国和南越的仆从加紧对柬埔寨王国进行挑衅。面临着美帝国主义新的冒险的阴谋活动，老挝人民将更加坚决地战斗到底，直到彻底挫败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    苏丹代表团团长奥斯曼·哈桑·艾哈迈德在报告中说，在非洲反帝革命斗争的舞台上，除美帝国主义者外，出现了一个新的敌人，这就是以苏共新领导为中心的现代修正主义者。现代修正主义者竭尽全力使非洲人民背离他们的主要斗争，力图扑灭非洲革命的火焰。他们千方百计地为以美帝为首的帝国主义者效劳，他们是帝国主义的真正帮凶。他指出，以苏联新领导为中心的现代修正主义者一直在口头上支持越南人民，但实际上却一贯以越南人民的鲜血和生命同美帝国主义做交易。
    奥斯曼在谈到发展亚非国家民族文化时强调指出，作家的笔杆应当用于反对帝国主义者及其帮凶的斗争。作家的迫切任务是揭露那些叛徒，使世界人民清楚地了解谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人，谁是真正的分裂主义者，谁在珍视和保卫革命运动。
    奥斯曼说，越南南方人民反对美帝侵略的战争，对于亚洲、非洲和世界上其他地方的人民，是一个范例，它证明真正的独立、自由和主权决不能象一些马克思列宁主义的叛徒所宣称的那样，用谈判或乞求去获得。
    日本代表团团员霜多正次在报告中说，日本作家反对美帝国主义的文化侵略，并且正在为日本民族民主文化而进行斗争。这个战斗对争取日本人民的真正解放和独立是不可缺少的。他谴责说，美帝国主义和日本反动派害怕日本人民团结起来的力量，所以进一步加强了文化、意识形态方面的进攻，以便破坏人民的团结，从思想上瓦解人们的斗争意志。
    霜多正次谈到美日反动派对日本进步文化工作者的迫害时指出，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争正在日益加强。
    印度尼西亚代表里莎戈达向会议作报告时说，亚非作家应该彻底与本国劳动人民和世界人民相结合，为反对头号敌人美帝国主义，反对现代修正主义者，争取完全的民族独立，和发展人民文化而斗争。
    他说，我们的时代，是人民要求作家全心全意为革命服务，要求亚非作家进一步巩固战斗的团结，以粉碎帝国主义、新老殖民主义及封建主义残余的时代。对亚非作家运动的攻击和分裂活动不仅来自帝国主义及其走狗，而且也来自他们的辩护士。亚非作家在这一时刻，正在为打击开罗分裂会议的祸首——苏联分裂主义者而进行激烈的斗争。
    他说，亚非作家应该手握笔、肩扛枪来进行战斗。
    他愤怒地揭露和剖析了美帝国主义颓废文学和苏联现代修正主义的叛徒文学的反动性。他说，尽管帝国主义者和它的“第五纵队”竭力企图在一些亚非国家中制造逆流，然而他们得到的将是一个失败接着一个失败，一个挫折接着一个挫折，直到完全灭亡。这股逆流绝不能阻挡亚非人民斗争文学的蓬勃发展。
    里莎戈达在报告中热情赞扬了正在中国轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命和它的伟大意义。他说，成亿万工农兵直接参加了这场文化大革命。它打破了帝国主义者和现代修正主义者企图把中国历史车轮拉回到一去不复返的黑暗时代的幻想，完全粉碎了美帝国主义及其帮凶想争夺中国青年一代的希望。用毛泽东思想武装起来的，正在轰轰烈烈进行的文化大革命的亿万中国工农兵和知识分子，一定会丰富和加强中国文学的战斗性和战斗精神。可以肯定，这件事不仅对中国有意义，而且具有国际意义。
    他强调指出，只要以美国为首的帝国主义还没有被彻底消灭，亚非的民族独立和文学发展将始终受到威胁。亚非作家必须与自己国家的人民以及世界人民，为击败垂死的美帝国主义所进行的革命斗争完全结合起来。他强调说，如果对修正主义不保持高度的警惕，我们就不可能取得反帝斗争的胜利。只有同时向现代修正主义——帝国主义的孪生兄弟进行斗争，才能胜利地进行粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义的任务。
    在今天的会议上宣读了越南民主共和国主席胡志明给这次会议的贺电。
    今天上午会议的执行主席是：约旦、朝鲜、老挝、刚果（布）、刚果（利）、科摩罗群岛六国（地区）的代表。下午会议执行主席是马来亚、尼泊尔、叙利亚、加纳、几内亚和莫三鼻给六国的代表。
    新华社二十九日讯又　有一批参加亚非作家紧急会议的外国代表和国际组织的观察员，于今天晚上乘飞机到达北京。到此为止，参加亚非作家紧急会议的已有五十二个国家和地区以及四个国际组织的代表和观察员。
