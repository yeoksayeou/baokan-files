    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd: Twelve Korean social organizations issued a joint statement on the 21st, strongly condemning the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, reiterating the Korean people's determination to drive US imperialism out of South Korea, strive for the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and calling on peace-loving people around the world to actively support the Korean people's just anti-American struggle.
    The statement was issued on the eve of the 16th anniversary of US imperialism's launch of the war of aggression against Korea (June 25th) and the "Anti-American Struggle Month" beginning June 25th.
    The statement said that on June 25, 1950, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against the Korean people. With the active support and solidarity of peace-loving people around the world, the Korean people launched a heroic struggle, giving the American aggressors a devastating blow and thwarting US imperialism's sinister plot to expand the flames of war to the Asian continent.
    The statement said that it has been thirteen years since the Korean armistice. However, Korea has still not achieved lasting peace, the peaceful reunification of Korea has not been realized, South Korea's politics, economy, military, culture, etc., are still completely under the control of US imperialism, and the South Korean people are under severe political oppression and increasingly heavy economic poverty.
    The statement said that the reunification of the fatherland is the greatest wish of all the people in North and South Korea. However, US imperialism and its lackeys disregard the unified desire of the Korean people to achieve national reunification. They are carrying out conspiracies under the guise of the "United Nations" in an attempt to make the division of Korea permanent and obstruct Korean reunification.
    The statement pointed out that the Korean reunification issue is an internal matter of the Korean nation and does not allow any external forces to interfere. The "United Nations" has no reason or right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean nation.
    The statement emphasized that the US aggressors are the fundamental obstacle to resolving the Korean issue. The US imperialist aggressor troops must immediately get out of South Korea with all their killing weapons.
    The statement said that US imperialism created the criminal "South Korea-Japan Treaty," causing the South Korean puppet group and Japanese militarists to collude with each other in politics, economy, and military affairs. The "South Korea-Japan Treaty" paved the way for Japanese militarists to re-invade South Korea, and linked to the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "South Korea-US Mutual Defense Treaty," it effectively means the formation of a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance." This is a serious threat to the Korean people.
    The statement said that in order to complete its aggressive military strategic system, US imperialism is plotting to piece together its vassal states and puppets in the Asia-Pacific region into a single Asian anti-communist military alliance. The "Seoul Conference" held under the direct manipulation of US imperialism is a product of this criminal conspiracy.
    After firmly condemning US imperialism's crimes in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the statement said that tens of thousands of South Korean puppet troops have been sent to South Vietnam, making South Korea the most important supply base for US imperialism to provide cannon fodder.
    The statement said that all facts show that the American aggressors are the chief culprits in obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and undermining peace in the Far East and Asia. The struggle to force the American aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea is a struggle to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and it is also a struggle to safeguard peace in the Far East, Asia, and the world. The statement demands that international organizations, social groups in various countries, and peace-loving people all over the world further strengthen the international struggle to force the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.
    The statement concluded that with the support and solidarity of the people of the world, the Korean people will certainly be able to force the US aggressor troops to withdraw from South Korea and achieve the independent reunification of the fatherland. US imperialism will surely perish, and the cause of human history will surely triumph.
    The twelve social organizations that issued this statement include the Korean Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, the Korean Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, etc.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: On the eve of the 16th anniversary of US imperialism's launch of the war of aggression against Korea on "June 25th," Park Se-chang, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a press conference this morning.
    Kim Jae-suk, Counselor of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, delivered a speech on behalf of Ambassador Park Se-chang.
    Kim Jae-suk condemned US imperialism for intensifying preparations for a new war in South Korea in order to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, and for directing Japanese militarism and the South Korean puppets to collude militarily. He said that in order to eliminate the national disaster suffered by the Korean people, realize Korean reunification, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, the US aggressor troops must withdraw from South Korea without delay.
    Kim Jae-suk finally expressed gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their consistent support and solidarity with the Korean people's just struggle against US imperialism and for the reunification of the fatherland. He said that with the support and solidarity of all friends in the world, the Korean people must drive the US imperialist aggressors out of South Korea and achieve the independent reunification of the fatherland.

    朝鲜十二个团体就美帝发动侵朝战争十六周年发表联合声明
    朝鲜人民决心赶走美帝统一祖国
    朝鲜驻华大使在“六·二五”十六周年前夕举行记者招待会
    据新华社平壤二十二日电  朝鲜十二个社会团体二十一日发表联合声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，重申朝鲜人民决心把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，争取祖国的自主和平统一，并呼吁全世界爱好和平人民积极支持朝鲜人民的反美正义斗争。
    这个声明是在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争十六周年（六月二十五日）和将从六月二十五日开始举行的“反美斗争月”前夕发表的。
    声明说，一九五○年六月二十五日，美帝国主义对朝鲜人民发动了侵略战争。朝鲜人民在全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持和声援下，展开英勇的斗争，给了美国侵略者以毁灭性的打击，挫败了美帝国主义妄想把战火扩大到亚洲大陆的凶恶阴谋。
    声明说，朝鲜停战已经十三年了。但是，朝鲜仍旧没有取得持久的和平，朝鲜的和平统一还没有实现，南朝鲜的政治、经济、军事、文化等仍然完全处于美帝国主义支配之下，南朝鲜人民群众处于严重的政治压迫和日益加重的经济贫困之下。
    声明说，祖国统一是南北朝鲜全体人民最大的愿望。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗无视朝鲜人民要求实现国家统一的一致愿望，它们并在“联合国”的幌子下进行阴谋活动，妄图使朝鲜分裂永久化，阻挠朝鲜统一。
    声明指出：朝鲜的统一问题是朝鲜民族的内部问题，不容许任何外来势力进行干涉。“联合国”没有任何理由和权利干涉朝鲜民族的内部问题。
    声明强调说，美国侵略者是阻挠解决朝鲜问题的根本障碍。美帝国主义侵略军必须带着一切杀人武器从南朝鲜立即滚出去。
    声明说，美帝国主义制造了罪恶的“韩日条约”，使南朝鲜傀儡集团和日本军国主义者在政治、经济、军事方面互相勾结起来。“韩日条约”为日本军国主义者重新侵略南朝鲜铺平了道路，同日美“安全条约”、“韩美共同防御条约”联系起来，事实上意味着形成了“东北亚军事联盟”。这是对朝鲜人民的严重威胁。
    声明说，美帝国主义为了完成侵略性的军事战略体系，正在策划把亚洲和太平洋地区的仆从国家及傀儡拼凑成一个单一的亚洲反共军事联盟。在美帝国主义直接操纵下举行的“汉城会议”，便是这种罪恶阴谋的产物。
    声明在坚决谴责了美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的罪行之后说，几万名南朝鲜伪军被派到南越，使南朝鲜变成了为美帝国主义提供炮灰的最重要的供应地。
    声明说，所有事实表明，美国侵略者是阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决、破坏远东和亚洲和平的罪魁祸首。迫使美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜的斗争，是争取和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争，同时也是维护远东、亚洲和世界和平的斗争。声明要求国际组织、各国社会团体和全世界爱好和平人民进一步加强迫使美军撤出南朝鲜的国际斗争。
    声明最后说，朝鲜人民在全世界人民支持和声援下，一定能迫使美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜，实现祖国自主统一。美帝国主义必将灭亡，人类历史事业必将胜利。
    发表这个声明的十二个社会团体包括朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会、朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会、朝鲜亚非团结委员会和朝鲜职业总同盟等。
    据新华社二十二日讯　在美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争的“六·二五”十六周年前夕，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使朴世昌今天上午举行记者招待会。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使馆参赞金在淑代表朴世昌大使发表谈话。
    金在淑谴责了美帝国主义为了进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国，正在南朝鲜加紧新战争的准备，并指使日本军国主义和南朝鲜傀儡在军事上勾结。他说，为了消除朝鲜人民所遭受的民族灾难、实现朝鲜统一、维护远东和世界和平，就必须使美国侵略军毫不拖延地撤出南朝鲜。
    金在淑最后表示感谢中国政府和中国人民一贯支持和声援朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和实现祖国统一的正义斗争。他说，朝鲜人民在全世界所有朋友的支持和声援下，一定要把美帝国主义侵略者赶出南朝鲜，实现祖国的自主统一。
