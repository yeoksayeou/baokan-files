    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Jakarta: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia, on the 2nd, sent a note to the Indonesian government, lodging the strongest protest against the serious incident of right-wing thugs, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang elements, destroying and seizing the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin with the cooperation of armed military police in South Kalimantan.
    The note exposed that the Indonesian government single-handedly created all the fascist atrocities of attacking and seizing Chinese representative offices and is rapidly sliding down the dangerous path of completely rupturing relations between the two countries. The note pointed out that in the face of irrefutable facts, all denials by the Indonesian government are futile.
    The note said: "At 9:20 a.m. on May 28, more than 40 Indonesian right-wing thugs, colluding with Chiang gang elements, scaled the wall and jumped into the courtyard of the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin, broke into the hall, pried open the doors and windows of offices, residences, and warehouses, and carried out destruction and looting. The thugs also openly seized the Chinese national emblem and the consulate's copper plaque, while climbing onto the flagpole and the roof of the hall, hanging more than a dozen Indonesian flags. The thugs concentrated the employees guarding the consulate and their families in the small building of the reception room, prohibiting them from moving around, and subjected them to various threats, attempting to force them to leave the consulate, but were met with the employees' stern refusal. The employees and their families, in order to protest the above atrocities, began a hunger strike that day. So far, the thugs are still entrenched in the consulate. The lives and safety of the above-mentioned employees and their families are under serious threat."
    The note pointed out: "What is even more outrageous is that this atrocity occurred entirely with the close cooperation of the local armed military police. Early that morning, a group of fully armed troops arrived and, under the personal command of GT. Syamsir Alam, commander of the 1007th Military District, blocked the Banjaran Lawu Street where the Chinese Consulate was located, prohibiting all pedestrians except the thugs from passing. Throughout the entire process of the thugs attacking and seizing the consulate, the military police were present to fully assist and cooperate. When the thugs handed over the Chinese Consulate to the Tenth Military District Command for 'takeover,' the Tenth Military District Commander Sabirin Mochtar publicly 'expressed respect' for their atrocities."
    The note said: "The Chinese Embassy believes it is necessary to remind the Indonesian government: it is beneficial to compare your words and actions. In your reply to the Chinese government on May 17, 1966, regarding the protest note about the forced occupation of the Chinese Embassy's Military Attaché Office and other buildings, you said: 'The Government of the Republic of Indonesia wishes to state clearly here that, up to now, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has no intention or plan to take over or confiscate buildings of the People's Republic of China.' But the fact is that actions of recklessly 'taking over' Chinese embassy and consulate buildings are appearing one after another in a planned and organized manner under the direction of the Indonesian government. Do you not feel that your actions have completely exposed your hypocrisy? While playing with rhetoric, you are engaging in the ugly act of trampling on international law, with the sole purpose of continuing to infringe upon and seize the diplomatic and consular representative offices of the People's Republic of China, rapidly sliding down the dangerous road of completely rupturing relations between the two countries, in order to meet the needs of imperialism and new and old colonialism. Is this not obvious?"
    The note emphasized: "The above-mentioned serious incident of the South Kalimantan military authorities colluding with right-wing thugs and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang elements to attack and seize the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin once again powerfully demonstrates that all fascist atrocities of attacking and seizing Chinese representative offices are created single-handedly by the Indonesian government; since the Indonesian government has done this, and dares not take responsibility for its crimes, it precisely shows that it is most afraid of this series of extremely ugly acts being thoroughly exposed before the Indonesian people and the people of the world, so it repeatedly denies and repeatedly spreads lies. However, in the face of irrefutable facts, any lies are untenable, and all denials are futile."
    The note demanded that the Indonesian government immediately withdraw the thugs who have seized the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin, compensate for all losses, and guarantee the personal safety of the consulate employees and their families.

### 我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼当局指使暴徒与蒋帮分子霸占我驻马辰领事馆  印尼政府一切抵赖都是枉费心机

    我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼当局指使暴徒与蒋帮分子霸占我驻马辰领事馆
    印尼政府一切抵赖都是枉费心机
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二日照会印度尼西亚政府，就右派暴徒伙同蒋匪帮分子在南加里曼丹武装军警的配合下，破坏和霸占中国驻马辰领事馆的严重事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会揭露印度尼西亚政府一手制造了所有袭击和霸占中国代表机构的法西斯暴行，并且沿着完全破裂两国关系的危险道路迅速地滑下去。照会指出，在确凿的事实面前，印度尼西亚政府的一切抵赖是枉费心机的。
    照会说：五月二十八日上午九时二十分，印度尼西亚右派暴徒伙同蒋帮分子约四十余人，翻过院墙，跳进中国驻马辰领事馆院内，闯入大厅，撬开办公室、住室和仓库的门窗，进行破坏和抢劫。暴徒们还公然劫走了中国国徽和领事馆的铜牌，同时爬上了旗杆和大厅屋顶，悬挂了十多面印度尼西亚的国旗。暴徒们把看守领事馆的雇员和他们的家属集中扣押在传达室的小楼上，不准走动，并对他们进行种种威胁，企图迫使他们离开领事馆，但遭到雇员的严正拒绝，雇员和他们的家属为了抗议上述暴行，当天起就进行绝食。到目前为止，暴徒们仍然盘踞在领事馆内。上述雇员和他们的家属的生命安全受到了严重的威胁。
    照会指出：更加令人愤慨的是，这次暴行完全是在当地武装军警的密切配合下发生的。当天清晨就开来一批全副武装的军队，在第一○○七军分区司令GT·沙姆希尔·阿拉姆亲自指挥下，封锁了中国领事馆所在的班芝兰老务街，除暴徒以外，其他行人一概禁止通行。在暴徒袭击和霸占领事馆的整个过程中，军警都在场全力协助和配合。当暴徒们把中国领事馆交由第十军区司令部“接管”时，第十军区司令沙比粦·默足达尔竟公然对他们的暴行“表示敬意”。
    照会说：“中国大使馆认为有必要提醒印度尼西亚政府：对照一下你们的言语和行动是有益的。你们在一九六六年五月十七日答复中国政府关于中国大使馆武官处等馆舍被强占的抗议照会时说：‘印度尼西亚共和国政府愿意在此明确表示：到现在为止，印度尼西亚共和国政府没有接管或没收中华人民共和国建筑物的意图和计划’。但事实是，肆无忌惮地进行‘接管’中国使领馆房舍的行动，却在印度尼西亚政府的指使下，一个接连一个有计划、有组织地出现，你们不感到自己的所作所为，完全戳破了你们伪善的面目吗？你们一面玩弄花言巧语，一面干着践踏国际公法的丑事，无非是要继续侵犯和霸占中华人民共和国的外交和领事代表机构，迅速沿着完全破裂两国关系的危险道路滑下去，以适应帝国主义和新老殖民主义的需要，这难道还不明显吗？”
    照会强调指出：“上述南加里曼丹军事当局伙同右派暴徒以及蒋匪帮分子，袭击和霸占中国驻马辰领事馆的严重事件，又一次强有力地说明了：所有袭击和霸占中国代表机构的法西斯暴行，都是印度尼西亚政府一手制造的；印度尼西亚政府既然这样做了，又不敢承担罪责，正是说明它最害怕这一系列极端丑恶的行径，在印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民面前被彻底揭露，所以一再抵赖，一再散布谎言。然而在确凿的事实面前，任何谎言都是站不住脚的，一切抵赖都是枉费心机的。”
    照会要求印度尼西亚政府立即撤走霸占中国驻马辰领事馆的暴徒，赔偿一切损失，保证领事馆雇员及其家属的人身安全。
