Edition: 2

    Editor's Note from *Hebei Daily*: Comrade Lü Yulan's talk is filled with revolutionary spirit and materialist dialectics, possessing a clear class nature and a strong fighting spirit. This is a very good summary of her living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and a powerful rebuttal to the bourgeois "authorities" who slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers for their living study and application of Chairman Mao's works.
    Comrade Lü Yulan’s moving deeds of vividly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works once again eloquently demonstrate that when the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will possess lofty revolutionary ideals, selfless revolutionary morals, and fearless revolutionary courage; they will fear neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor demons, be full of courage and fearless; and they will contribute everything they have to the cause of socialism and communism.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Thorough materialists are fearless... 'Dare to unhorse the emperor,' we must have this fearless spirit when fighting for socialism and communism." Lü Yulan is precisely a person with this fearless spirit. She understands that class struggle is an objective existence and cannot be avoided. She said, "Doing revolution means not being afraid of trouble; the more you fear, the more trouble you get; only by daring to struggle can you win." She sees struggle as life and regards it as her greatest spiritual pleasure. She said, "Whenever I encounter risks, I think it is the best test for me." She understands that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing, and she stands firm and unwavering in the face of the enemy's rampant attacks. She said, "They are not fighting me; they are fighting the socialist road I am upholding." "The more they fight me, the more enthusiastically I work." What resounding heroic words, what admirable and praiseworthy heroic spirit! It is precisely because Lü Yulan possesses such a fearless spirit that she can resist evil winds, suppress evil waves, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and achieve victory after victory in class struggle.
    This fearless spirit of Lü Yulan, stemming from the cause of communism, is precisely what we urgently need in carrying out the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals should all follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, like Lü Yulan, fear neither ghosts nor demons, neither wind nor waves, neither difficulties nor obstacles, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to break through, dare to do, and dare to make revolution. Dare to overthrow bourgeois "authorities" and bourgeois representatives, dare to open fire on all anti-Party and anti-socialist black lines, and dare to criticize the old world. Act as revolutionary vanguards, be revolutionary "demolition experts," and fight heroically to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to defend socialism!

    I. Why do some people say I am "silly," and how should we view "cleverness" and "silliness"?
    Different standpoints lead to different views on cleverness and silliness.
    Some people call me "Silly Yulan," believing that I am simple-minded, don't understand "happiness," don't know how to "live," and only know how to work stupidly.
    Am I silly or not?
    I won't harm the public to benefit myself, won't engage in speculation, won't play petty tricks. If that's what you call "silly," then I'm "silly."
    However, I use my brain for the sake of the Party, the country, and the collective, single-mindedly working hard. If you say that's silly, I don't agree. Whether you're silly or not depends on what kind of accounts you're calculating!
    "You're mindless." I say it depends on what kind of mind it is:
    A mind filled with only the word "I" is an individualistic mind;
    A mind with "public" in command is a communist mind.
    People's starting points are different, their calculations are different, their thoughts are not the same, so how can they understand each other? You say I'm too silly, but I think I have my own kind of cleverness.
    Chairman Mao said: "There are great principles and small principles, and all small principles are governed by great principles." Why you live, and for whom you live, is the root of everything. If the root is different, different flowers will bloom.
    Different standpoints lead to different views. In my opinion, selfish people are the most ignorant and foolish. A person with selfishness has prejudice, and only selflessness has fairness and truth.
        Different times have different standards for cleverness and silliness.
    Using cleverness and silliness to judge right and wrong, as a standard for measuring people, this "silliness" has a class nature. The old poor peasants often told me: In the old society, the ruling class fooled people, saying that poor people were silly and deserved to be poor; rich people were clever and deserved to be rich. At that time, poor people were looked down upon, their words didn't carry weight, they were foolish even if they weren't, and silly even if they weren't.
    In the old society, a person who only worked hard for the ruling class was a slave and a fool.
    The social system has changed, the times have changed, and the standards for cleverness and silliness have also changed.
    Some people, though the land and livestock belong to the collective, their minds haven't joined the collective. Their bodies are sitting on the socialist chariot, but their minds are still thinking about "I" being in charge. You say "serve the people," they don't believe it; if you truly serve the people, they say you're silly.
    Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, putting "public" first and "self" in the background, the "petty clever people" will become fewer and fewer, the "big fools" will become more and more, and our society will become one where "if people don't work for the public, heaven and earth will punish them," and where the words "self" and "steal" are equally despised.
        Be silly for the collective, be silly for the people, be silly for socialism.
    Those who are selfless are ridiculed as fools by those who harm the public to benefit themselves.
    "You say I'm 'silly,' then I'm 'silly'!"
    The two "silly" words have completely different meanings. "I'm silly for the collective, silly for the people, silly for socialism" is the latter "silly."
      "Rather be a big fool for a lifetime than a petty clever person for a day." We led the masses to launch a major discussion on cleverness and silliness, criticized the "petty clever people," praised the "big fools," "cleverness" became stinky, and "silliness" became fragrant, and everyone competed to be a revolutionary "fool." Some people were anxious to tears when they couldn't be rated as "fools"; some people felt worse than being cursed when they were called "petty clever people."

    II. Why do I regard revolution as a lifelong undertaking?
      Eyes must see communism, and the heart must hold the entire world.
    After graduating from senior primary school, I returned to my hometown to participate in agricultural production, became the head of an agricultural cooperative, and joined the Party. Only then did I realize: How a person lives in this world is related to the world. A life dedicated to liberating all of humanity and fighting for the cause of communism is the most glorious life, and doing revolution is my lifelong undertaking.
    Without the people's great world, there would be no liberation of the working people! Some people like to say now: "Earning food and eating depends on strength!" Have you forgotten whose work you are earning, and whose food you are eating? If the socialist country is not protected, where does the principle of distribution according to labor come from? If the land is in the hands of the landlords, what good is your strength?
    I linked my personal marriage with the country's five-year plan because I thought that today, we each can have happiness because we have our own country. With a country, we have a home. Personal matters are linked to the country, like a large basin containing a small basin, a small circle contained within a large circle.
    We must look far ahead, draw the circle large, our eyes must see communism, and our hearts must hold the entire world.
    In the face of class enemies, the revolutionary people share the same fate; it's important to take the overall situation into account.
    Once, I was attending a meeting in Tianjin and heard a report from the leadership on the situation in Vietnam. I wished I could fly to South Vietnam immediately and fight the US imperialists. The people of China and Vietnam are heart-to-heart. I gave the fifteen yuan I originally intended to buy clothes with to the leaders to comfort the Vietnamese people. I felt that this was also supporting our heroes who were killing the enemy.
      The interests of the majority are important, personal interests are minor.
    Class struggle needs me, the poor and lower-middle peasants need me. Leaving the revolution to consider personal matters is to evade the struggle.
    Those who take the capitalist road wanted to trap me with personal marriage, to squeeze me out, and I held my breath; the imperialists and revisionists want our second and third generations to not make revolution, and I also held my breath. The two breaths together became my revolutionary ambition, to resolutely carry on to the end, to make revolution for a lifetime!
    Personal happiness is a small matter, revolution is a big matter. I often think of what Lei Feng said: I live to make the majority live better. That's right; when the vast majority of people are happy, I myself am the happiest.
                Farsightedness and shortsightedness.
    When a person is in their twenties or thirties, it is the golden age. In this era, concentrate on studying Chairman Mao's works well, do more work for the Party, add a brick or a tile to the socialist edifice, and invest limited life in unlimited causes. If a woman wants to truly liberate herself, she must first break free from the shackles of old traditions and old habits and get rid of dependent thinking.
    Some people don't link their personal future with the revolution, but always link it with finding a spouse, relying on men. With this kind of dependent thinking, they don't want to liberate themselves.
    Personal marriage is a small matter, striving for women's liberation is a big matter, you can't just care about the present, you have to see the transformation of customs over one generation, two generations, and several generations.
    The smaller picture must obey the bigger picture, personal interests must obey collective interests. It is more meaningful to dedicate the golden age to revolution than to be entangled in family and children too early. Therefore, I shifted my lifelong undertaking from personal marriage to the word "revolution."

    III. Why do I work even more happily the more I am struggled against?
    In the winter of 1960, those who were taking the capitalist road united to struggle against me. They struggled against me for three nights in a row, but my work didn't slacken in the slightest. They said, "It's really damn strange; the more they struggle against her, the more happily she works." Now some comrades also ask: Some people lie down and do nothing after being criticized. Why can you withstand the wind and suppress the waves, and work even more happily the more you are struggled against? What were you thinking at that time? I thought: The rectification campaign is not rectifying me, but the shortcomings and mistakes in me.
    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, everyone raised shortcomings in my work, and my parents complained that being a cadre was too much effort and not rewarding, and they didn't want me to do it anymore. I studied the article "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" with this problem in mind.
    Mistakes and shortcomings are like sores on my body; if not treated, they will fester, and the more they fester, the bigger they become. It hurts when treating them, but it will be fine afterward. People cannot avoid making mistakes; it is a good comrade to know one's mistakes, admit them, and correct them. I regard daily criticism and self-criticism as a small face wash, and the rectification movement is a big bath. After the bath, the whole body feels light and comfortable.
    Our achievements and strengths have all been seen by the Party. The Party's rectification is not to make things difficult for us, but to care for us, cultivate us, and prevent us from going bad. The Party's rectification is like adults loving children, not covering up their faults.
    To withstand the rectification, you must first have a correct understanding of the rectification, adopt a correct attitude, separate achievements from shortcomings, look at yourself with a "one divides into two" approach, and not cover up a hundred uglinesses with one good thing. If you have achievements, you don't want people to say "no." "The masses are a scale, and they can weigh things accurately." Don't just believe that you are completely right, and don't listen to the criticism of the masses.
    They are not fighting me; they are fighting the socialist road I am upholding.
    In the rectification movement, several people who were resolutely taking the capitalist road viciously attacked me. They accused me of sneaking into the Party in 1948. How ridiculous! I wasn't even ten years old at that time. I saw through their tricks. They were not fighting me; they were fighting the socialist road I was upholding. They wanted to confuse me, so I would lie down and do nothing. I didn't fall for their tricks.
    Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. Their opposition to me proves that I am doing the right thing. The more fiercely they oppose me, the more it proves that I am right, and the more resolutely I will continue to do it.
    I thought, your opposition to me is useless. The poor and lower-middle peasants support me! At night, several old poor peasants secretly protected me on the roof and in the courtyard, and comforted me. With these people to support me, what am I afraid of? I will do what I should do.
    As the meeting was about to end, I said: "Don't leave, everyone. There is work to be arranged. The rectification should bring out enthusiasm..." In this way, they had no choice but to give up.
            Small difficulties are small tests, big difficulties are big tests.
    During the nights when they were struggling against me, I couldn't sleep, so I studied Chairman Mao's works and thought of the heroes of the past. I thought of the hero Liu Hulan who was unyielding in the face of the enemy's guillotine. Could I be frightened by fallacies? "True gold is tested by fire." This is a severe test of me by the Party. Usually, I speak very resolutely. At this critical moment, see if I can withstand the wind and waves, adhere to the truth, and be a true communist party member. Once the word "I" is discarded, and I think of the test, the stubborn energy of not fearing "ghosts" comes up.
    Now, whenever I encounter risks, I think it is the best test for me. Small difficulties are small tests, big difficulties are big tests, one difficulty is one tempering, the more tempering, the faster, the purer. If you often walk a hundred *li*, you won't take ten or eight *li* seriously. "The more ore is refined, the more refined it becomes; the more muddy water is clarified, the clearer it becomes." Without struggle, where would I get the experience of struggle?
    The Party and the masses educated me from the positive side, and the class enemies educated me from the negative side. Now some people say to those who take the capitalist road: "The more you oppose Yulan, the stronger she becomes. You are the ones who have trained her."

    IV. Why don't I feel like being a cadre is "losing out"?
    When being a cadre, first clarify what is the capital and what is the home.
    In the past, my father used to say: "You don't manage the family affairs, you don't look after the private plot. Where is your home?" He said I was a "cadre who loses out." I thought: Cadres are the stewards of everyone. The Party has entrusted the people of the whole village to us, and we must take on the responsibility. Revolution is my capital, and the collective is my home. I eat at home, but the person belongs to the public.
    Our village's production team leader, Lü Shizhou, took the collective as his home and always regarded the team's affairs as more important than his own, reversing the positions of "self" and "public." It was a good reversal. To be a cadre, you must put your heart on the word "public" and not regard your position as a special privilege, "One person becomes a cadre, and the whole family benefits." Making revolution is not about making a profit or losing money. When revolution needs it, even life can be contributed. Otherwise, how can the sacrifice of life that Bethune made when he came to China be calculated?
                  Whom are you working for as a cadre?
    Some say, "Hey! Being a cadre is not rewarding." I don't understand this. We say serving the people every day. Is it true or false? If you truly serve the people, why look for a "reward"? In fact, the thought of losing out when being a cadre is simply because the thought of looking for a "reward" is at work.
    Making revolution is conscious, not an employment relationship. Revolution is not doing business. Some say that being a grassroots cadre is not as good as being a salaried cadre. This is how I think: Whether revolutionaries receive a salary or not doesn't matter. People who don't make revolution can't do well, no matter how much salary they receive. Revolutionaries can do well even without a salary. In the past, the older generation of revolutionaries shed blood and sacrificed themselves, but who worked for a salary? Realizing communism is our greatest "reward."
    Some feel wronged and say, "I won't work for him." Who are you working for? Are you working for the superiors? Who are the superiors working for? We are not communist party members of one village, we are communist party members of China, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world, not working for any one person. We must not be sulky at any time.
                  Is being a cadre at a disadvantage?
    Some say that being a cadre is a disadvantage. Is it really a disadvantage?
    If being a cadre doesn't think for the collective, but only thinks about getting more for yourself, production will not be done well, you will be scolded, and your personal income will not increase much.
    Especially when poor and lower-middle peasants are cadres, they are holding the seal of the class and working for themselves. If we don't seize the seal and let others seize it, are we better off?!
    Not feeling like being a cadre is losing out is the clearest calculation, and shouting "losing out" and looking for a "reward" is the most confused calculation.

    V. Why do things happen the more you fear them?
              Doing revolution means not being afraid of "trouble."
    In the past, I was afraid of "trouble," and always felt that the people in my village were backward, that there was a lot of "trouble," and I cried because of the difficulty. I wrote to the district women's federation asking not to do it anymore.
    When I went to the province to attend a meeting, I heard a lecture on "On Contradiction," and I realized that objective things are contradictory, and contradictions are endless. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will appear.
    With the ideological weapon of Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," I thought about contradictions whenever I encountered "trouble" and thought "work is struggle." I no longer had the burden of being afraid of "trouble" in my mind, and I was not worried or afraid when "trouble" occurred.
    Contradictions are not to be feared, but to be fought off. I often think: The more you fear "trouble," the more "trouble" occurs. Daring to struggle is victory. "Afraid that falling leaves will hit your head," "Afraid of stepping on ants when walking," how can such people make revolution?
    I have become accustomed to the life of struggle for more than ten years, and struggle has become my greatest spiritual pleasure. When there is no "trouble" weighing on my head, I feel bored, listless, and meaningless. When I start working, I don't get tired even if I don't sleep for days and nights.
                When encountering "trouble," you must go all out.
    In 1963, there was a flood. Some people said, "It's over." I said, "Let's do it!" The more "trouble" I encountered, the more I ate, and I went all out. That year, we withstood the flood. In the old society, it was said, "Accept fate," "Accept bad luck." That was superstition and the old philosophy of life, and we couldn't listen to that. In times of crisis, the more you go all out, the bigger the "trouble" becomes, and the more completely it is over; the more you go all out, "If you are not afraid of death, what else are you afraid of?" Use one point of strength to fight for one point of strength, and you can turn danger into safety, or at least reduce losses.
    With courage, you are not afraid of Mount Tai; with timidity, you are frightened by a brick. "The bold travel across the ocean, the timid can't move an inch." To make revolution, you must have courage. You can only suppress difficulties; you can't let difficulties frighten you.
    Before "trouble" occurs, take the initiative to attack. Making revolution means attacking.
    In class struggle, some people who take the capitalist road bully the weak and fear the strong. We not only cannot be afraid, but also must strive for the initiative, run ahead of them, and propose the problem and attack them before "trouble" comes out. Originally, when a task came down, those who were taking the capitalist road always sang a counter-melody and sabotaged it. Later, I gained experience. Whenever there was a new job or a new task, I would first warn them at the meeting and expose their tricks. This way, they would be more honest.

    VI. Why am I not afraid of offending people?
    To say that being a cadre in the village offends people, you have to see what kind of people you offend. It is right to offend class enemies. For our own people, try not to hurt feelings and offend people as little as possible. How can you offend people as little as possible? My experience is:
            The more you fear offending people, the more people you offend.
    When doing things, you have to take care of one side, take one side. Take care of the socialist side, and lean towards the poor and lower-middle peasants. When making revolution for the people, not everyone will applaud. The moon is so bright, but thieves still oppose it! Being afraid of offending people, saying things like "For one person, there is one road; offending one person, there is a wall," "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down," is individualism. I offend people for the public good, not for personal gain, so I'm not afraid.
    When dealing with the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, telling the truth to the Party and the state offends those who have serious capitalist ideas. Not offending them harms the Party and the state and offends the people. In the collective, if you don't care about things that damage collective interests, you will offend the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.
            The more resolutely you manage, the fewer people you offend.
    I manage early, manage small, and manage strictly those who violate the system and infringe upon collective interests. If one person starts a bad trend, ten or eight people will follow. Managing early prevents the seeds of bad things from taking root. Managing strictly prevents people with capitalist ideas from taking advantage of loopholes, and fewer people will be offended.
            The more unfairly you manage, the more people you offend.
    Example is better than precept. Hundreds of eyes are watching us. If we do things unfairly, the people will not be convinced, and we will offend the majority of people. We must manage well, take one step at a time, and treat each problem as a model. Examples are the most convincing.
    Each time relief supplies were distributed, those who were taking the capitalist road, the "petty clever people," after studying the relief recipients at the meeting, would knock on people's doors in the middle of the night: "I got you relief funds. Lü Yulan didn't agree..." People who are accustomed to playing tricks like this think they have mastered the masses. In fact, they are just like Chairman Mao said: "All cunning people, people who do not act according to scientific principles, who think they are clever, are actually the most stupid and have no good results." They use state relief funds to buy "goodwill." Such "goodwill" is not lasting. When they turn around, people will think: "If you have a personal relationship with me, then you must be cheating others. You can't be trusted."

    VII. Why am I not afraid of being "bumped" when uniting people?
      If you don't unite with your class brothers, it is your own first mistake.
    Ni Xiuli is a poor peasant who joined the army to resist Japan when he was a teenager and shed blood and fought for the revolution. In the past, we were not united. First, we didn't take good enough care of him. Second, he is a veteran, and I didn't learn enough from him and didn't rely on him well enough.
    Seeing that I was wrong, I felt very painful. I sincerely examined myself, and then I had the sincerity to unite. I thought, "Uniting with him is to overcome my own shortcomings and correct my own problems. I was wrong in the past, and I can't be wrong again in the future."
    Being afraid of "being bumped" and giving up unity, being too concerned about my own face is also wrong.
    I also thought that whether or not I could unite with comrades was not just a matter for one person. It was a matter of whether or not I could unite with the majority of the masses and whether or not I could take over the revolutionary class well. The more arduous the task of unity, the more it could train me. I regarded unity as a "mountain" and used the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."
    The more comrades we unite with, the more strength the revolution gains. Uniting comrades is a matter of fighting for people in the class struggle. I unite people for the revolution and am not afraid of "being bumped."
      If he doesn't listen to what I say, it's because my method of helping people is wrong.
    Several times when I talked to him, I couldn't get through to him, so I thought, this person is proud of his achievements, looks down on me, and doesn't listen to others. I won't talk to him anymore. Then I thought again: "People who seek progress are good at examining themselves, and people who don't seek progress are good at complaining about others." I should first examine myself. Why doesn't he listen to what I say? It is my responsibility. It's not that he doesn't understand the truth, it's that I haven't done my job well, that I haven't explained the truth thoroughly, that my method is wrong. Like doing experiments, I treated uniting people as a serious job. I found a lesson every time I failed, and I examined myself every time I got "bumped."
    Care for him in life and move him with class feelings. First, emotional fusion, then ideological exchange. When the other person's mind is no longer "bouncing," then meet ideologically and carry out criticism, and he will listen to it, and the desire for unity will be realized.

    VIII. Why do I take the lead in practical work?
                Without personal example, it is difficult to teach by words.
    To be a cadre, you have to promote education and do political and ideological work. You have to say a lot of words every day, but will people listen? The key lies in acting on your words. People are like this. If what you say is not sincere, those who listen will not believe you. That year, when the Dongfeng Canal opened up, the weather was cold, and I used my mouth to call out, but no one went into the water. I took the lead in jumping into the water, and everyone followed.
    Doing leadership work, practical work saves a lot of effort. Practical work is the most labor-saving leadership. "Saying a thousand, talking ten thousand, is not as good as taking the lead."
              Without practical work, it is difficult to achieve leadership.
    Last year, when fighting drought and digging wells, we couldn't dig them, and the people who went down the well said, "Our land here is not good; we can't dig a well." The deputy secretary of the Party branch and I went down the well and dug it successfully. Then we started working and dug several wells in a row, which played no small role in fighting the drought.
    I thought that to be a leader, if you don't actually do it, don't contact reality, you won't have true knowledge and can only say whatever people say. This is not a leader, but someone who is led. Don't look at the fact that you issue a lot of orders; in reality, you are a loudspeaker. If you don't dare to break through, it is difficult to gain experience.
    I became a cadre at the age of fifteen. Where did my experience come from? I relied on the word "breakthrough."
      "A pawn never crosses the river and always goes straight." Some people don't do it themselves and only pick on the faults of others. These people don't know that doing it, at most, has a few finger's worth of faults, not doing it has ten finger's worth of faults, and not doing it is the biggest mistake.
      "The first time is unfamiliar, the second time is familiar, and the third time is no more." If you don't learn, you won't understand; if you don't do it, you won't know. You can, but I can't. The distance is in "learning," and the gap is in doing.
    The Party wants us to be the promoting faction of the revolution and encourages us to break through. As long as we follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, we should break through where we should break through. At a meeting in the province, the provincial leaders instructed me: "You must have this spirit of breakthrough; to make revolution, you must break through." I remembered these words and studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" again when I got home. This year, we resolutely will not be foot-bound women in production and resolutely will increase grain production, breaking through a path to high yield. "Big things are done by big people." If we don't take big steps to break through, we will never be able to greatly change the situation.

    IX. Why don't I talk about "favoritism"?
              Be public to public, not private to private.
    The old saying goes: "Being familiar with people is a treasure," "Being familiar with people means not talking about reason." We can't do that. We can't use our power under the banner of "public" and do things based on favoritism. We must act according to principles and regulations. Not only can't we turn public affairs into private affairs, but we must think about everything we do in terms of public affairs. We only have public and no private—that's what it means to be completely selfless.
    When I am sick, some comrades take good care of me. I think this is a kind of class feeling, it is doing political work for me. I thank them, but I don't necessarily reciprocate them in private. I work hard in my work, do my job well, and repay them with work achievements. I can't "get a cow from someone and return a horse." Be public to public, not private to private.
                Being good to me may also be bad for me.
    Someone being good to you is not necessarily really good. You have to use class analysis. In 1962, someone sent me sesame cakes and noodles. This was a "good thing," right? In reality, it was to make me make mistakes, to get me to do things for him. I said: "The more you send me things, the harder it is to do things. If you want me to do things not according to policy, I won't even if you send me a mountain of gold."
    "If you take something from someone, you are obligated; if you eat something from someone, you are lenient." Relying on your position in the village and receiving gifts from people, sending them back and forth, you will lose your revolutionary stand. Gifts are not sent for nothing. The person who sends the gift is thinking of getting ten for sending one. The person who receives the gift has no choice but to be fooled. Class enemies are used to this trick. We must be extra vigilant.
    When I listen to someone, I have a bottom line in my heart. I have to look at their purpose for good words and bad words. Goodness can't just be about being good to me. It has to be based on being good to the collective and good to socialism.
            You can't understand class feelings with personal feelings.
    When my mother was sick, I went to a meeting as soon as she got a little better. Some people said that I was not filial to my mother.
    Over the years, when I have encountered difficulties in my work, when capitalist forces have struggled against me, I have been very sad. I have never shed tears in front of my parents, but when I met the higher-level Party committee, tears streamed down my face. Some people don't understand this kind of feeling. I don't understand them either. I think the Party is closer than my father and mother, and socialism is better than anything else.
    In daily life, some people use personal feelings to understand public feelings:
    For example, "Your job is good!" What's good about it? Is it that it is famous and profitable, that it is easy and not tiring, or does it refer to the great contribution to the revolution? What is included in this word "good"? In my opinion, whatever job is good, it is done for the revolution, and it depends on whether it is done well or not. We love whatever we do, not because of personal interest, but because it is revolutionary work. If it is not revolutionary work, we don't love anything. For example: "You do a good job; every line of work produces champions." Doing a good job is to make a great contribution to the revolution, not to become a champion. Aspiring must not be to personal fame and gain; striving must not be for personal fame and gain. We must aspire to the great aspirations of the revolution, the great aspirations of the people, and strive for the great efforts of the revolution.
            Exercise class vision in daily work.
    Why are people's thoughts different? In the past, it was thought that this person had a good heart and a good temper. Upon careful analysis, people's thoughts and consciousness are not in whether they have a good temper or not. People of one class, whether they have a quick temper or a slow temper, can all talk to each other.
    Different family backgrounds mean different class imprints in thought. Many discords among members and families seem to be due to incompatible tempers. In fact, just like Li Shuangshuang and Sun Xiwang, it is a struggle between two kinds of thought.

    X. Why do I single-mindedly emphasize politics?
        Politics is always present; if you don't emphasize this, you emphasize that.
    Recently, some people said that I open my mouth and talk about politics. Taking the establishment of banners and models as an example, our brigade is now carrying out a movement to learn from the "Five Big Fools." In fact, models have always existed. If you don't emphasize socialist models, you emphasize capitalist thinking and the models of "petty clever people." A few years ago, when reclaiming small barren plots, several people in the village reclaimed a lot, and they gained more grain personally, so they became the objects of "learning and catching up" for some people.
    There is no political vacuum in society. If the political atmosphere of the proletariat is not strong, the atmosphere of

### 十个为什么？——读毛主席的书听毛主席的话照毛主席的指示办事的体会

    十个为什么？
    ——读毛主席的书听毛主席的话照毛主席的指示办事的体会
    河北省临西县张三寨公社东留善固大队党支部书记　吕玉兰
    《河北日报》编者按：吕玉兰同志的这篇谈话，充满了革命精神和唯物辩证法，具有鲜明的阶级性和强烈的战斗性。这是她活学活用毛主席著作的一篇很好的总结，是对那些资产阶级“权威”污蔑工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的有力回击。
    吕玉兰活学活用毛主席著作的动人事迹又一次雄辩地说明：工农兵群众直接掌握了毛泽东思想，就能具有远大的革命理想，无私的革命品德，无畏的革命胆略；就能天不怕，地不怕，不怕鬼，不怕魔，浑身是胆，无所畏惧；就能为社会主义共产主义事业贡献自己的一切。
    毛主席教导我们说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的……‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”吕玉兰正是具有这种大无畏精神的人。她懂得阶级斗争是客观存在，是回避不了的。她说：“干革命就不能怕事，越怕越出事，敢于斗争才能胜利。”她把斗争看做是生活，当成自己最大的精神愉快。她说：“一遇上风险，就想到是对我最好的考验。”她懂得被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事，在阶级敌人猖狂进攻面前，巍然不动，坚定不移。她说：“他们斗的不是我，是我坚持的社会主义道路。”“他们越斗我干得越欢。”多么响亮的豪言壮语，多么可歌可颂的英雄气概！吕玉兰正是具有这样的大无畏精神，所以才能顶歪风，压恶浪，依靠贫农下中农，在阶级斗争中取得一个又一个的胜利。
    吕玉兰这种从共产主义事业出发的大无畏精神，正是当前我们开展无产阶级文化大革命所迫切需要的。广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，都应当遵照毛主席的教导，象吕玉兰那样，不怕鬼，不怕魔，不怕风吹浪打，不怕艰难险阻，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢做、敢革命。敢于打倒资产阶级“权威”和资产阶级代表人物，敢于向一切反党反社会主义的黑线开火，敢于批判旧世界。作革命的闯将，当革命的“爆破手”，为捍卫毛泽东思想，为保卫无产阶级专政，为保卫社会主义而英勇战斗！
    一、为什么有人说我“傻”，怎样看待“精”和“傻”？
    立场不同，对精傻的看法不同
    有人说我是“傻玉兰”，认为我头脑简单，不懂得“幸福”，不会“生活”，只知道傻干。
    我傻不傻呢？
    我不会损公肥私，不会投机取巧，不会打自己的小算盘，要说这就是“傻”，我就算“傻”。
    可是，我对党、对国家、对集体，是费脑子的，一个心眼拼着干，要说这是傻，我不答应。傻不傻，那要看你算的什么账！
    “你这个人没头脑”。我说得看是什么样的头脑：
    满脑子只一个“我”字，是个人主义的头脑；
    脑子里“公”字挂帅，就是共产主义的头脑。
    人的立足点不同，算法不一样，想的不是一个理，怎么会互相理解？你说我太傻，我觉得我有自己的聪明。
    毛主席说：“事情有大道理，有小道理，一切小道理都归大道理管着。”为什么活着，为谁活着，这是条总根儿。总根不一样，开不出一样花。
    立场不同，看法不同，依我看，私心眼的人最没见识，最愚蠢，一个人有私就有偏见，无私才有公道，才有真理。
            时代不同，精傻的标准不同
    以精傻论是非，作为衡量人的标准，这个“傻”是有阶级性的。老贫农常对我说：旧社会，统治阶级胡弄人，说穷人傻，该穷；富人精，该富。那时候穷人被人看不起，说话不占地方，不呆也呆，不傻也傻。
    在旧社会，一个人只为统治阶级卖力，那才是奴才、傻瓜。
    社会制度变了，时代变了，精傻的标准也变了。
    有的人，土地、牲畜归集体，思想没归集体，身子坐在社会主义大车上，脑子里还是“我”当家。你说“为人民服务”，他不信；你真为人民服务，他说你傻。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑，“公”字当头，“私”字退位，“小精人”越来越少，“大傻子”越来越多，我们的社会就变成“人不为公，天诛地灭”了，变得“私”字和“偷”字一样臭。
        傻于集体，傻于人民，傻于社会主义
    公而忘私的人，被那些损公肥私的人讽刺为傻子。
    “你说我‘傻’，我就‘傻’！”
    前后两个“傻”字，意义完全不同。“我傻于集体，傻于人民，傻于社会主义”，就是后面那个“傻”字。
      “宁当一辈子的大傻子，不当一天小精人。”我们领导群众开展了精傻的大讨论，批判了“小精人”，表扬了“大傻子”，“精”臭了，“傻”香了，人人争当革命的“傻子”。有人评不上“傻子”，急得要哭；有人听到叫他“小精人”，他觉得比骂他还厉害。
    二、为什么我把革命当做终身大事？
      眼要看到共产主义，心要装下整个世界
    高小毕业后，回家乡参加农业生产，当了农业社长，入了党，受到党的教育，这才知道：一个人活在世上，跟世界是个什么关系。解放全人类，为共产主义事业奋斗的一生是最光辉的一生，干革命才是我的终身大事。
    没有人民的大天下，就没有劳动人民的解放！现在有人好说：“挣工吃饭，凭的是力气！”忘了挣的谁的工，吃的谁的饭？社会主义江山不保，哪来的按劳分配原则？土地在地主手里，你有力气顶啥用？
    我把个人婚姻和国家五年计划联系起来，我是想，今天我们每个人能有幸福是因为有我们自己的国家，有国才有家。个人的事是和国家联在一起的，好比大盆套小盆，小圈套在大圈里。
    我们要往远处看，圈要往大里划，眼要看到共产主义，心要装下整个世界。
    在阶级敌人面前，革命的人民都是一个命运，顾大局要紧。
    有一次我在天津开会，听了领导上关于越南形势的报告，我恨不能一下子飞到南越去，跟美帝国主义干一场。中越人民心连心，我把本来想买衣裳的十五块钱交给领导，慰问越南人民，我觉得这也是支援了我们的杀敌英雄。
      大多数人的利益是大事，个人利益是小事
    阶级斗争需要我，贫农下中农需要我，离开革命需要考虑个人私事，就是逃避斗争。
    那些走资本主义道路的人，想用个人婚姻圈住我，挤走我，我憋了一口气；帝国主义、修正主义想要我们第二代、第三代不革命，我也憋了一口气。两口气儿加在一起，就成了我的革命志气，坚决干到底，革命一辈子！
    个人幸福是小事，革命是大事。我常想雷锋说的这句话：我活着就是为了让多数人活的更美好。这话对，让绝大多数人幸福了，我自己也是最幸福的。
                眼光远大和鼠目寸光一个人二三十岁的时候，正是黄金时代，在这个时代，集中精力把毛主席著作好好学一学，为党多做些工作，为社会主义大厦，多砌一块砖，多添一片瓦，把有限的生命投进无限的事业里面去。一个妇女要想真正解放自己，就先要从旧传统、旧习惯的束缚下挣脱出来，打掉依赖思想。
    有的人不把个人前途和革命联系在一起，老是和找爱人联系在一起，依赖男人。有这种依赖思想，自己就不想解放自己。
    个人婚姻是小事，争妇女解放是大事，不能光顾眼前，要看到一代人、两代人、几代人的移风易俗。
    小局要服从大局，个人利益要服从集体利益，把黄金时代献给革命比过早的缠在家庭、孩子身上意义大，因此，我才把终身大事，从个人婚姻移到“革命”二字上来。
      三、为什么越斗我干得越欢？
    一九六○年冬，走资本主义道路的人联合起来斗争我。一连斗了我三夜，可是我的工作一点也不松劲。他们说：“真他妈的邪门，越斗，她干得越欢”。现在也有的同志问：有的人受了批评躺倒不干，你为什么能顶住风，压住浪，越斗干得越欢呢？你当时是怎么想的？我想：整风不是整的我，是我身上的缺点、错误。
    整风开始，大家提了工作上的缺点，爹娘埋怨我当干部费力不讨好，不让我干啦。我带着这个问题学习了《整顿党的作风》这篇文章。
    错误、缺点就象我身上的疮，不治就要化脓，越烂越大。治的时候疼，以后就好了。人不能不犯错误，知错认错，改正了就是好同志。我把日常的批评和自我批评看做是小洗脸，整风运动就是大洗澡，澡洗过了，浑身轻快。
    我们有成绩、有优点，党都看见了。党来整风，不是对我们为难，是爱护，是培养，是怕我们变坏了。党来整风，就象大人爱小孩，不护短。
    要在整风中挺得住，先要对整风有个正确认识，抱正确态度，把成绩和缺点分开来，一分为二看自己，不能一好遮百丑，有了成绩，就不愿让人说“不是”。“众人是杆秤，斤两称分明”，不要光信自己全对，听不得群众的批评。
    他们斗的不是我，是我坚持的社会主义道路
    在整风运动中，几个坚决走资本主义道路的人，对我恶毒攻击。他们上告我一九四八年混入党内。多笑话！那时我还不到十岁。我看清了他们的鬼把戏，他们斗的不是我，是我坚持的社会主义道路。他们想斗懵了我，躺倒不干，我不中他们的奸计。
    被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。他们反对我，证明我做对了。他们反对的越凶，越证明我对，我就更坚决干下去。
    我想，你们反对我顶个屁用，你们反对我，贫农下中农可支持我呢！夜里几个老贫农在房上、院里暗暗保护我，安慰我，有这些人给做主，怕什么？我该干什么还是干什么。
    临散会了，我说：“大家不要走，有工作要布置，整风要整出干劲来……”这样一来，他们也就无计可施了。
            小困难小考验，大困难大考验
    斗我的那几天夜里，觉我是睡不着，就学起毛主席著作来，想起了过去的英雄。我想起了英雄刘胡兰在敌人铡刀面前英勇不屈，我能在歪理面前吓倒？“烈火炼真金”，这是党对我的严重考验。平常里说得挺坚决，来到节骨眼上，看我能不能顶住风浪，坚持真理，是不是一个真正的共产党员。一把“我”字丢开，一想到考验，不怕“鬼”的楞劲就上来了。
    现在我一遇上风险，就想到是对我最好的考验。小困难是小考验，大困难是大考验，一次困难一次磨炼，越磨越快，越炼越纯。常走百里路，十里八里就不当回事了。“矿石越炼越精，混水越澄越清。”没有斗争，我哪来的斗争经验呢？
    党和群众从正面教育了我，阶级敌人从反面教育了我，现在就有人对走资本主义道路的人说：“你们越跟玉兰做对，她越坚强，她这个人就是你们把她锻炼出来的。”
    四、为什么我当干部不觉得“赔本”？
    当干部先弄清哪是本？哪是家？
    过去，俺爹好说：“家里事你也不管，自留地你也不望，哪是你的家？”说我是“赔本干部”。我想：干部是大家的管家人，党把全村人交给我们了，我们就要把担子担起来，革命是我的本，集体是我的家。我吃饭在家，人是公共的。
    俺村生产队长吕世周，以集体为家，从来把队上的事情比自己的看得还重要，把“私”和“公”的位置调换了个过。换得好，当干部就得把心放在“公”字上，不能把职务看成是特权，“一人当干部，全家沾光。”干革命是不能讲赔本赚钱的，革命需要的时候，连生命也可以贡献。要不，白求恩到中国来牺牲了生命这笔账怎么算？
                  当干部究竟为谁？
    有的说：“咳！当干部没落头。”我不理解这话，我们天天说为人民服务，是真的还是假的呢？真为人民服务还找什么“落头”呢？其实当干部赔本的思想，说穿了，就是因为有找“落头”的思想作怪。
    干革命是自觉的，不能有雇佣观点。革命不是做买卖。有人说当基层干部不如脱产干部拿工资。我是这样想：干革命的人不在领不领工资，不革命的人领多少工资也干不好，革命者不拿工资也一样干得好。过去老一辈的革命者，流血牺牲，可谁为工资干的？实现共产主义，是我们的最大的“落头”。
    有人觉得冤屈，说：“不给他干。”给谁干呢？给上级干的吗？上级给谁干的呢？我们不是一个村的共产党员，是中国的共产党员，是为中国人民和世界人民服务的，不是给哪个人干的，任何时候也不能赌气。
                  当干部是否吃亏？
    有人说当干部吃亏，是否真吃亏？
    要是当干部不为集体想，光想自己多弄点，生产搞不好，自己挨点子骂，个人也多收入不了。
    尤其是贫农下中农当干部，是掌阶级的印把子，为自己办事。我们不抓印把子，让人家抓到手里，自己就沾光啦？！
    当干部不觉得赔本是最明白的账，喊“赔本”、找“落头”是最糊涂的账。
      五、为什么越怕出事越出事？
              干革命就不能怕“事儿”
    过去怕“事儿”，老觉得自己村里人落后，“事儿”多，自己难的哭过，给区妇联写信要求不干了。
    去省里开会，听到讲《矛盾论》，才知道客观事物都是矛盾着的，矛盾是没完的，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又会出现。
    有了毛主席《矛盾论》的思想武装，以后遇上“事儿”，就往矛盾上想，想“工作就是斗争”，思想上没有怕“事儿”的包袱了，出了“事儿”不愁也不怕。
    矛盾不是怕掉的，是斗掉的。我常想：越怕出“事儿”越出“事儿”，敢于斗争就是胜利。“掉下树叶来怕砸着脑袋”，“走路怕踩死蚂蚁”，那样的人还能干革命？
    十多年来斗争生活过惯了，斗争成了我一种最大的精神愉快。一没“事儿”压住头，就闷的慌，没精打彩，没意思。干起工作来，几天几夜不睡也不困。
                遇上“事儿”要豁上干
    一九六三年闹洪水，有的人说：“完了。”我说：“干哪！”我越遇上“事儿”吃得越多，豁上干，不能豁上不干。那年抗住了洪水。旧社会里说：“认命”，“认倒霉”，那是迷信，是旧的处世哲学，不能听那一套。危急的时候，越是豁上不干，“事儿”就越大，也就彻底完了；越是豁上干，“不怕死了还怕什么？”有一分力气拼一分力气，就能转危为安，至少也少损失。
    胆子大，泰山也不怕，胆子小，一块砖头也吓倒。“胆大漂洋过海，胆小寸步难行”，干革命就要有胆量，只能压住困难，不能叫困难吓住。
    出“事儿”以前，先进攻，干革命就要进攻
    在阶级斗争中，一些走资本主义道路的人欺软怕硬。我们不光不能怕，还要争取主动，跑在他们前头，“事儿”还没出来，就先提出问题，向他们进攻。原先，一项工作下来，走资本主义道路的人总是唱对台戏，搞破坏。以后，我有经验了，每有新的工作、新的任务，就先在会上警告他们，揭破他们的花招。这样他们就老实一点了。
      六、为什么我不怕得罪人？
    要说在村里当干部得罪人，得看得罪什么人，得罪阶级敌人是应该的。对于自己人，尽量不伤害感情，少得罪人。怎样才能少得罪人呢？我的体会是：
            越怕得罪人，得罪的人越多
    办事情就要顾一头，一边倒。顾社会主义这一头，往贫农下中农这边倒。为人民干革命，不会人人都叫好，月亮那么明，作贼的还反对呢！怕得罪人，说什么“为一个人一条路，得罪一个人一堵墙”，“出头的椽子先烂”，是个人主义思想。我是为公得罪人，不是为私得罪人，所以我不怕。
    在处理国家、集体和个人的关系的时候，向党向国家说实话，就得罪资本主义思想严重的人；不得罪他们，就害党害国家，得罪了人民；在集体里，对损害集体利益的事不管，就会得罪广大贫农下中农。
            越管得不坚决，得罪的人越多
    我对违犯制度，侵犯集体利益的人，管早、管小、管严。一个人开了个坏头，就会有十个八个的跟上来。管早了，把坏事儿的苗子管住，成不了事儿。管严了，不给有资本主义思想的人钻空子，得罪人反而少。
            越管得不公，得罪的人越多
    身教重于言教。几百双眼睛看着咱，办事不公，众心不服，就得罪大多数人；管必管好，一步一个脚印，处理一个问题就是一个样板，榜样最有说服力。
    每次发放赈济，那些走资本主义道路的“小精人”，在会上研究了赈济对象以后，半夜里砸开人家的门：“我给你解决了救济款。吕玉兰不同意……”这种惯于耍手腕的人，自以为掌握了群众，其实，不过象毛主席说的：“一切狡猾的人，不照科学态度办事的人，自以为得计，自以为很聪明，其实都是最蠢的，都是没有好结果的。”他们拿着国家救济款去买“好”，这样的
  “好”是不长久的，回过头来人家就会想：“你跟我有私，就跟别人有弊，不能相信你。”
    七、为什么我团结人不怕“吃碰”？
      没把阶级兄弟团结好，是自己第一个不对
    倪修礼是贫农，十几岁参军抗日，为革命流血奋斗，过去我们不团结，第一是对他照顾不够；第二，他是复员军人，我向他学习不够，没有好好依靠他。
    看到自己不对，感到很痛心，虚心检查自己，就有团结的诚意了。我想：“团结他，就是克服我身上的缺点，改正我身上的毛病，过去我不对了，今后不能再不对。”
    怕“吃碰”放弃团结，自己爱面子也是不对
    我还想，能不能团结同志，不是一个人的问题，是能不能团结群众大多数的问题，是能否接好革命班的大事情。团结的任务越艰巨，越能锻炼我，我把团结当做“大山”，用“愚公移山”的精神就行了。
    多团结一个同志，革命就增加一分力量。团结同志是在阶级斗争中争夺人的问题。我为革命团结人，不怕“吃碰”。
      说话他不听，是自己帮助人的方法不对头
    有几次跟他谈话，谈不通，就想，这人居功骄傲，看不起我，听不进别人的话去，不跟他谈了。又一想：“求进步的人好检讨自己，不求进步的人好埋怨别人”。应该首先检讨自己，我说话，为什么他不听？是我的责任。不是他不明白道理，是工作还没做到家，是我没把道理说透，是我的方法不对头。象搞试验一样，把团结人当成一项严肃的工作来做，失败一次就找一次教训，吃一次“碰”就检讨一次。
    从生活上关心他，用阶级感情感动他。先感情交融，再思想交流。等对方脑子不“崩簧”的时候，再思想见面，开展批评，他就听得进去了，团结的愿望就实现了。
      八、我为什么带头实干？
                没有身教就很难言教
    当干部要宣传教育，要做政治思想工作，每天要说很多话，人家听不听呢？关键在于身体力行。人就是这样，说的不诚，听的就不信。那年东风渠开口子，天寒水冷，我用嘴招呼，没人下水，我带头跳下水去，大家也随着下去了。
    做领导工作，实干省很多劲，实干是最省力的领导。“说一千，道一万，不如带头干”。
              没有实干就很难实现领导
    去年抗旱打井，打不成，下井的人说：“咱这地皮不行，打不出井来。”我和党支部副书记下井干，挖成了。接着就干起来了，一连挖出好几眼井，抗旱当中起作用不小。
    我就想，当领导，自己不实际干，不接触实际，就没有真知，只能人家说啥是啥，这不是领导人，而是被人领导。别看发号施令不少，实际是个传声筒。不敢闯，就很难得到经验
    我十五岁上当干部，哪里来的经验，就靠一个“闯”字。
      “小卒子不过河永远走直道。”有的人自己不干，专挑别人的毛病。这种人不知道：干，最多是几个指头的毛病，不干是十个指头的毛病，不干就是最大的错误。
      “一回生，两回熟，事不过三”，不学不懂，不干不会。你会我不会，距离就在“学”上，差距就在干上。
    党要我们当革命的促进派，鼓励我们去闯，只要按照毛主席指的方向走，该闯的就闯。在省里开会，省委领导同志嘱咐我说：“要有这股闯劲，干革命就要闯。”我记住这话，回家来又学了一遍毛主席的《实践论》。今年生产坚决不当小脚女人，坚决把粮食产量搞上去，闯出一条高产的路子来。“天大的事由地大的人去干”，不迈大步闯，就老是不能大大改变面貌。
      九、为什么我不讲“人情”？
              要公对公，不要私对私
    旧说法：“人熟是一宝”、“人熟不讲理”。我们不能闹那一套。不能打着“公”的招牌利用职权，凭人情办事。必须按原则办事，按规定办事。不光不能把公事办成私事，我们做一切事情都要往公事上想，我们身上只有公没有私——才算大公无私。
    我病了，有的同志对我照顾好，我认为他这是一种阶级感情，是对我做政治工作，我感谢他，不一定在私人方面回敬他，在工作上努力，把工作做好，以工作成绩来报答他，不能“得人一牛，还人一马”。要公对公，不要私对私。
                对我好也可能对我歹
    有人对你好，不一定就真好，得用阶级分析。一九六二年一个人给我送烧饼、送挂面，这是“好事”吧，实际是让我犯错误，是让我给他办事情。我说：“你越给我送东西越不好办，你要我不按政策办事，送个金山也不行。”
    “拿了人家的手短，吃了人家的嘴软”。在村里仗凭职权受人家的礼物，送来送去，就把你的革命立场送掉了，礼没有白送的，送礼的人想的是送一个，得十个，受礼的人是没有不上当的。阶级敌人惯爱来这一套，我们要加倍警惕。
    我在听话的时候，心里有个底，好话、坏话，要看他的目的，好不能光看对我好，要以对集体、对社会主义好为标准。
            不能用私人感情理解阶级感情
    我娘病了，稍一好我就去开会，有人说我对娘不孝。
    这些年，我工作中遇上困难，资本主义势力斗争我，心里多难过，在爹娘面前没掉过泪，可是见了上级党委，眼泪簌簌的掉，有人对我这种感情不理解。我对他们也不理解，我觉得爹亲娘亲不如党亲，千好万好不如社会主义好。
    日常里，有的人就用私情来理解公情：
    比如说：“你这工作好啊！”什么好？是有名有利好，是清闲不累好，还是指的对革命贡献大好，这个“好”字里包括的是什么？我看，什么工作也好，都是为革命而干，就看做好做不好。我们干一行爱一行，不是因为个人的兴趣，是因为它是革命工作。不是革命工作，就什么也不爱。再比如：“你工作干得好，行行出状元”。干工作往好上干，是对革命贡献大，不是为当状元，立志不能立个人的名利志，发奋不能发个人的名利奋，要立革命的大志，立人民的大志，发革命的大奋。
            在日常工作中锻炼阶级眼光
    人的思想为什么不一样，过去认为这人心眼好、脾气好，认真分析，人的思想意识不在脾气好坏。一个阶级的人，急脾气的，慢脾气的，都能说到一块去。
    家庭出身不同，思想上阶级烙印不同，许多社员和家庭里的不和睦，看起来是脾气不对头，实际正象李双双、孙喜旺一样，是两种思想的斗争。
    十、为什么我一个心眼的突出政治？
        政治时时都有，不突出这，就突出那
    最近有人说我张口就是政治。拿树旗帜搞样板来说，我们大队现在开展学习“五大傻”运动。其实，样板早就有，不突出社会主义的样板，就突出资本主义思想“小精人”的样板。前几年开小片荒，村里有几个人开得多，个人收得粮食多，就成了一些人“学赶”的对象。
    社会上政治真空是没有的，无产阶级的政治风气不浓，走亲串门，街谈巷议，为个人打小算盘的风气就兴起来。在地里干活歇畔，你不学毛主席著作，他就会议论谁吃得好，谁穿得好，谁挣得多。
    社会主义和资本主义是两套马车，一个往东，一个往西，都有赶车的、帮套的，你不把人们往社会主义道上领，就有人坐资本主义车上西去。
  抓人抓思想最实际，抓虚不虚，光抓实际不实际
    没有强调突出政治以前，我也是习惯于抓实不抓虚，一研究工作就是积多少肥、打多少井、增多少产、植多少树、搞什么副业，不研究人的政治思想。参加省里学习毛主席著作积极分子大会，听解放军“红九连”的报告，人家解放军做什么工作先想到人，“办事先管人，管人先管心，管心先知心”，我回来决心照着办了以后，很有成效。
    什么事都是人干的，人是根本，人的思想是根本。要狠狠抓人的因素，抓活的思想，学会深入细致地做思想工作。
        如何做思想工作？如何个别谈话？
    个别谈话，不要光说人，也叫人家说说自己，要有来有往，互相交心。提高了人家，也提高了自己，这有什么不好的呢？
    “话不投机半句多”，说话先挂钩，启发自觉，促使个人思想打架，内因起作用。“一笔画不成龙，一锨挖不成井”。什么病用什么药，急于求成反倒坏事。
        抓自己的学习，才能领导群众学习
    毛主席在《实践论》里教导，要虚心体察情况，这个“体”字，我的领会是反反正正的想，干部常想：“假如我是社员”，下级常想：“假如我是领导”，这样互相体察，上下左右的事就好办了。
    我领导群众学习毛主席著作，首先自己抓紧学，一个是起带头作用，一个是体会如何带着阶级感情学，如何带着问题学，读了哪些话在思想上起作用大，然后再研究群众的学习情况。
    思想改造是看不到的，不虚心体察是发现不了的，自己抓紧跟“我”斗，才能想出教育别人跟“我”斗的点子。
