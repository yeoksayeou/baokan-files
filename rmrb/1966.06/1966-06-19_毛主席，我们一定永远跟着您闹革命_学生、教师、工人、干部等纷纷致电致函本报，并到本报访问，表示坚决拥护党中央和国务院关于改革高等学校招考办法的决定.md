    Chairman Mao, We Will Always Follow You in Making Revolution
    Students, Teachers, Workers, Cadres, etc. Send Telegrams and Letters to This Newspaper, and Visit This Newspaper, Expressing Firm Support for the Decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on Reforming the College Entrance Examination Methods
    (Our Dispatch) After the announcement of the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council regarding the reform of college entrance examination methods, it received widespread and enthusiastic responses. From 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. on the 18th, this newspaper successively received a large number of letters, manuscripts, and dazibao (big-character posters) from revolutionary students, graduate students, teachers, workers, cadres, scientific workers, shop assistants, etc. from universities and middle schools in Beijing. They expressed their enthusiastic support to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for their wise decision. On the 18th alone, eighty-one telegrams were also received from twenty-one provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, and many visitors were received.
    The entire revolutionary students of Class Four, Senior Three of Beijing Women's No. 12 Middle School, wrote in a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: "We swear to the Party: As long as we are here, there will be an iron-clad socialist country! As long as we are here, Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down from generation to generation! As long as we are here, no one can stop the Chinese Revolution and the World Revolution! Respected Chairman Mao! Please rest assured that the revolutionary cause has successors!"
    All the revolutionary youths of Class Four, Senior Three of Beijing Women's No. 4 Middle School, expressed to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: "Every revolutionary youth deeply understands that our generation is an extremely crucial generation, a generation that carries on the past and opens up the future. Mao Zedong Thought relies on us to receive it, relies on us to pass it on, and pass it on from generation to generation! The burden of the Chinese Revolution and the World Revolution relies on us to bear it! All old systems rely on us to smash them! The new system of the proletariat relies on us to create it!" They expressed their determination to carry out this Great Cultural Revolution to the end under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao.
    Ten students from Class Two, Senior Three of the Affiliated Middle School of the Central University for Nationalities, poured out their joy and gratitude in a letter to the beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The letter said, "After our classmates from all ethnic groups heard the letters from the students of Class Four, Senior Three of Women's No. 1 Middle School and Class Five, Senior Three of Beijing No. 4 Middle School to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we were extremely excited, and we agree a thousand times, we support ten thousand times. Their words represent the hearts of all revolutionary young students, and speak out the hearts of our revolutionary students of all ethnic groups. For many years, the examination-oriented college entrance examination system has been like invisible chains, restricting the hearts of many young people and poisoning many young people. The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the education sector, who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, have tried their best to exclude the children of poor and lower-middle peasants and workers from entering school, but have opened the door wide for young people who are deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie and take the road of becoming bourgeois experts. Today, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have made a very wise decision, completely shattering the shackles that bind our spirits. For this reason, we warmly cheer: This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!
      "Respected Chairman Mao, you are the forever-shining red sun in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups! We deeply feel your wisdom and greatness, and we deeply feel that a revolutionary cannot leave Mao Zedong Thought for even a minute or a second. Respected Chairman Mao! Thousands of words cannot express our infinite love for you, and no language in the world can express our infinite admiration for you. Chairman Mao, please rest assured that we will always follow you in making revolution. Chairman Mao, we swear to you: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and never stop until the feudal and reactionary old system of the education sector is completely smashed. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever and highly flutter on the proletarian education front!
    "Respected Chairman Mao, we are now ready to go and are just waiting for your call to rush to various battlefields!"
    Seventeen students from Class Three, Senior Three of Beijing No. 26 Middle School, expressed in the dazibao "Listen to Chairman Mao's words and struggle for the revolution for life" their determination to "be firm and reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, not bourgeois college students." They said, "For a long time, the old college entrance examination system has bound our revolutionary youths, preventing them from developing actively and vigorously in an all-round way in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, according to Chairman Mao's teachings. We warmly cheer the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. This decision is a great revolution on the education front! It is a severe blow to the bourgeois representatives who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought and who attempt to change the color of our country." "Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we are determined to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We firmly support the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination system, and we must thoroughly eliminate the revisionist black line in the education sector and create a proletarian revolutionary education line, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory!" "Respected Party Central Committee, respected Chairman Mao, we guarantee to you that we will read Chairman Mao's books for the rest of our lives, we will listen to Chairman Mao's words for the rest of our lives, and we will take over and pass on the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, so that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will fly all over China and all over the world."
    After hearing the broadcast, teachers and students of Dingxing Middle School in Hebei excitedly spread the news, and the whole school was in a festive mood. The graduating students of the four classes of Senior Three immediately held discussions, posted hundreds of dazibao supporting the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and sent a head teacher of Senior Three by train to Beijing, representing all the graduates to deliver a declaration of firm support for the Central Committee's decision. They said: "The vast majority of us are children of workers and peasants. Without the Communist Party and without Chairman Mao, we would have nothing. Everything we have belongs to the Party and belongs to the people. The needs of the motherland are our aspirations. We are ready and let the Party choose us!"
    Sun Shaohou and five other teachers from Licheng No. 3 Middle School in Shandong made a long-distance call, warmly supporting the Central Committee's decision and urgently requesting that Licheng No. 3 Middle School be immediately turned into a proletarian part-work, part-study school.
    The entire revolutionary teachers and students of Zunyi No. 4 Middle School, a famous revolutionary historical city, conveyed by long-distance call their full support and enthusiastic response to the revolutionary initiative of Beijing Women's No. 1 Middle School, and their letter to the beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In their letter, they said, "When we are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and sweeping away all monsters and demons, we are overjoyed to hear the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. All the revolutionary teachers and students of the school are ecstatic, spreading the news and unable to sleep all night. This is the complete destruction of the evil old education system of thousands of years, another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With extremely excited hearts, we firmly support this wise decision of the Central Committee." (Attached pictures)

    毛主席，我们一定永远跟着您闹革命
    学生、教师、工人、干部等纷纷致电致函本报，并到本报访问，表示坚决拥护党中央和国务院关于改革高等学校招考办法的决定
    本报讯　中共中央和国务院决定改革高等学校招考办法的通知公布以后，得到了广泛热烈的响应。自十八日清晨六时到晚上十时，本报陆续收到北京大、中学校的革命学生、研究生、教师、工人、干部、科学工作者、店员等送来的大批信件、稿件和大字报。他们热情洋溢地向毛主席和党中央表示，坚决拥护党中央和国务院的英明决定。十八日一天中，还收到从全国二十一个省、市、自治区发来的八十一封电报，并接待了许多来访者。
    北京女十二中高三（四）班全体革命学生在给党中央、毛主席的信中写道：“我们向党宣誓：有我们在，就有社会主义铁打的江山！有我们在，毛泽东思想就能世世代代传下去！有我们在，中国革命和世界革命谁也无法阻止！敬爱的毛主席！请您放心，革命事业后继有人！”
    北京女四中高三（四）班全体革命青年向党中央和毛主席表示：“我们每个革命青年都深深地懂得，我们这一代是极其关键的一代，是承上启下的一代。毛泽东思想靠我们来接，靠我们去传，世世代代地传下去！中国革命、世界革命的重担靠我们来承担！一切旧制度靠我们砸烂！无产阶级的新制度靠我们去创建！”她们表示坚决在毛主席的英明领导下，把这场文化大革命进行到底。
    中央民族学院附中高三（二）班十位同学在给亲爱的党中央和毛主席的信中，倾诉了他们喜悦和感激的心情。信中说，“我们各族同学听到女一中高三（四）班和北京四中高三
  （五）班同学们给党中央和毛主席的信以后，心里万分激动，我们一千个同意，一万个拥护。他们的话代表了所有革命青年学生的心意，说出了我们各族革命学生的心里话。多年来，科举式的高考制度象无形的锁链，束缚了多少青年的心，毒害了多少青年。钻到教育界的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物，他们极力排挤贫下中农和工人的子女入学，却给受资产阶级影响极深的走白专道路的青年大开方便之门。今天，党中央和毛主席做了非常英明的决定，彻底地粉碎了束缚着我们精神的枷锁。为此，我们热烈地欢呼：这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！
      “敬爱的毛主席，您是我们各族人民心中永远不落的红太阳！我们深深感到您的英明和伟大，我们深深感到一个革命者真是离开毛泽东思想一分钟、一秒钟都不行。敬爱的毛主席呵！千言万语也表达不完我们对您的无限热爱，世界上没有任何语言能表达出我们对您的无限敬仰的感情。毛主席，请您千万放心，我们一定永远跟着您闹革命。毛主席，我们向您宣誓：我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不彻底粉碎教育界的封建的、反动的旧制度决不罢休。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远地、高高地飘扬在无产阶级教育阵地上！
    “敬爱的毛主席，我们现在已整装待发，只等您一声召唤，就立即奔向各个战场！”
    北京二十六中高三（三）班十七个同学，在“听毛主席的话，为革命奋斗终生”的大字报中表示，决心“做无产阶级革命事业坚定可靠的接班人，不做资产阶级的大学生。”他们说，“长期以来，旧的高考制度束缚着我们革命青年，不能按照毛主席的教导，在德智体三方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展。我们热烈欢呼党中央和国务院的这一英明决定。这个决定是教育战线上的一个大革命！它给妄图使我们国家改变颜色的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物狠狠的当头一棒。”“在党和毛主席的领导下，我们坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。坚决拥护党中央和国务院关于改革高考制度的决定，一定要把教育界的修正主义黑线彻底搞掉，创出一条无产阶级的革命教育路线，不获全胜，决不收兵！”“敬爱的党中央，敬爱的毛主席，我们向您们保证，毛主席的书我们要读一辈子，毛主席的话我们要听一辈子，我们要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗接过来，传下去，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗飘扬在全中国，飘扬在全世界。”
    河北定兴中学师生听到广播后，激动地奔走相告，全校一片欢腾。高三四个班应届毕业生立即进行讨论，贴出了几百张拥护党中央和国务院决定的大字报，并派一位高三的班主任，坐火车赶来北京，代表全体毕业生送来坚决拥护中央决定的宣誓书。他们说：“我们绝大部分都是工农子女，没有共产党、没有毛主席，就没有我们的一切。我们的一切都是属于党的，属于人民的。祖国的需要就是我们的志愿。我们已做好了准备，任党挑选吧！”
    山东历城第三中学教师孙绍厚等六人，打来长途电话，热烈拥护中央决定，迫切要求立即把历城三中改成无产阶级的半工半读的学校。
    革命历史名城遵义市四中全体革命师生，用长途电话传来了他们全面支持和热烈响应北京女一中的革命倡议，给敬爱的党中央和毛主席的信。他们在信中说，“当我们正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的时候，欣闻中共中央和国务院的决定，全校革命师生，欢喜若狂，奔走相告，彻夜难眠。这是千百年来万恶的旧教育制度的彻底摧毁，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。我们以万分激动的心情，坚决拥护中央的这一英明决定。”（附图片）
