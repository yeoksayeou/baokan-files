   Golden Sun Embedded in My Heart
    Soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Guangxi　Gao Fengqi
    Chairman's writings are close to my heart, my heart becomes gold that never rusts.
    A golden phoenix flies from my heart, heartfelt songs burst forth.
    Chairman's writings are close to my heart, like a ship with a helmsman.
    Fear not the distant revolutionary journey, turbulent currents and hidden reefs are easily overcome.
    Chairman's writings are close to my heart, the soldier's heart flows with hot blood,
    Turning into an iron arm to defend the country, turning into a sharp sword to斩魔狗 (cut down demon dogs).
    Chairman's writings are close to my heart, revolutionary war songs sung from my throat,
    Though in the company, I see the world, the golden sun is embedded in my heart.

   金色太阳嵌心头
    广西解放军某部战士　高凤栖主席著作贴胸口，心变黄金永不锈。心窝飞出金凤凰，贴心歌儿唱出口。主席著作贴胸口，好比航船有舵手。革命征途不怕远，激流暗礁等闲走。主席著作贴胸口，战士心中热血流，化作铁臂守江山，化作利剑斩魔狗。主席著作贴胸口，革命战歌唱出喉，身在连队看世界，金色太阳嵌心头。
