    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Ito Minoru, the head of the visiting delegation of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and Standing Director of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, recently visited our country and expressed his impressions, saying: Mao Zedong Thought is not only the sun for the Chinese people but also the sun in the hearts of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are striving for national liberation. It is also the power and source of the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations and people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest Marxism-Leninism of our time. What I am saying is not mere courtesy, but the sincere feeling in my heart. I previously learned through *Beijing Review* that the Chinese people are holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, but I did not treat Mao Zedong Thought as a living ideology. After we came to China and visited two factories, we saw that Chinese workers, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, were bringing their maximum strength and wisdom into play to transform machines, improve technology, and save materials. We learned that the Chinese workers are making such efforts not only for China's socialist construction but also for the liberation of the people of the world. The fact that China has achieved such great accomplishments in just sixteen years is entirely the result of 650 million Chinese people being armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    Speaking of the anti-American struggle, Ito said: American imperialism is the most ferocious common enemy of the people of the world. We cannot fight alongside those who do not struggle against American imperialism or truly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people who stand at the forefront of the people's struggle of the world. Engaging in united struggle with these people will only keep us permanently under American imperialist occupation. To defeat American imperialism, we must resolutely oppose Khrushchev's modern revisionism. China is currently carrying out a Cultural Revolution movement, which is entirely a people's war on the ideological front. It is also a link in dealing with the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States to attack China, that is, a link in preparing for war.

    Speaking of China's nuclear testing issue, Ito said: The conscious people of Japan are very happy about China's successful third nuclear test containing thermonuclear materials. China's successful third nuclear test completely shattered the conspiracy of Soviet-American nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. This is enormous support for the oppressed nations and people of the world and a huge blow to American imperialism and those who cooperate with it. Of course, there are also some forces in Japan that are desperately propagating that China's nuclear testing will bring death and working with the reactionary Japanese government to oppose China. However, more and more Japanese people understand that China is developing nuclear weapons to oppose American nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail and to support the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We sincerely believe in the Chinese government's statement that China will not be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances, and we fully believe that the Chinese people will work with the people of Japan, Vietnam, Korea, and Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for the complete prohibition of nuclear testing.

    Ito said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, China has been working to strengthen the international united front against the United States in the long liberation struggle of the past, in the period of socialist construction, and in other arduous struggles. We, the Japanese people, must further raise our awareness, strengthen our confidence, and resolve that, under any circumstances, we will strengthen our unity with the Chinese people and fight shoulder to shoulder to overthrow American imperialism and to achieve complete independence and liberation for Japan, the Vietnamese people, and the Korean people. We must combine China's experience with the specific conditions of Japan and launch a struggle against American imperialism. We believe that this visit to China will contribute to the struggle of the Japanese people for independence and democracy and will also contribute to strengthening the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

    日本朋友伊藤实说毛泽东思想是中国和亚非拉人民心中的太阳
    毛泽东思想是当代最高的马列主义
    中国文化大革命是思想战线上的人民战争
    本报讯　最近访问我国的日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团团长，日本亚非团结委员会常任理事伊藤实，发表访华观感说：毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的太阳，而且是争取民族解放的亚非拉三大洲人民心中的太阳，也是全世界被压迫民族和人民争取解放斗争的力量和源泉，毛泽东思想是当代最高的马列主义。我说的决不是客套话，是我内心感到的真心话。我以前通过《北京周报》了解中国人民正在高举毛泽东思想红旗，但没有把毛泽东思想当作活生生思想来对待，我们到中国后参观两个工厂，看到中国工人高举毛泽东思想红旗，发挥最大力量和智慧，改造机器、提高技术和节省材料。我们了解到中国工人这样努力，不仅是为了中国的社会主义建设，而且也是为了全世界人民的解放。中国能在短短的十六年中，取得这样伟大的成就，完全是六亿五千万中国人民用毛泽东思想武装的结果。
    伊藤谈到反美斗争时说：美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人，对那些不同美帝国主义斗争，不真正支援站在全世界人民斗争最前线的越南人民的斗争的人，我们是不能与之并肩作战的，如果同这些人搞联合斗争，只能使我们永远处于美帝占领之下，要打败美帝国主义，必须坚决反对赫鲁晓夫的现代修正主义。中国现在正开展文化革命运动，这完全是思想战线上的人民战争，也是为了对付苏美勾结进攻中国的一环，也就是备战的一环。
    伊藤谈到中国核试验问题时说：日本有觉悟的人民对中国第三次成功地进行了包含热核材料的核试验成功感到非常高兴。中国第三次核试验成功，彻底粉碎了苏美核垄断、核讹诈的阴谋，这是对全世界被压迫民族和人民的莫大支持，对美帝国主义以及与美帝合作者是巨大打击。当然，日本也有一部分势力拼命宣传中国核试验会带来死灰，同日本反动政府一起反对中国，但是越来越多的日本人民了解到中国发展核武器，是为了反对美国核垄断、核讹诈，支持亚非拉人民斗争的。我们从内心相信中国政府关于中国在任何情况下，都不首先使用核武器的声明，我们也完全相信中国人民是会和日本、越南、朝鲜以及亚非拉三大洲人民一道，为全面禁止核试验而努力。
    伊藤说：中国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在过去长期的解放斗争中，在社会主义建设时期以及其它的艰巨斗争中，都一直为加强反美国际统一战线而努力。我们日本人民也要进一步提高认识，加强信心，下定决心，无论在任何情况下，都要为打倒美帝国主义、为日本、为越南人民、朝鲜人民取得完全的独立和解放而同中国人民加强团结并肩战斗。我们一定要把中国的经验和日本具体情况结合起来，开展反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们相信，这次访问中国将对日本人民争取独立、民主的斗争作出贡献，对加强世界人民革命斗争方面也能尽一份力量。（附图片）
    在日本，有许多人为寻求真理而阅读毛主席著作。这是一些日本朋友在举行毛主席著作学习讨论会。
