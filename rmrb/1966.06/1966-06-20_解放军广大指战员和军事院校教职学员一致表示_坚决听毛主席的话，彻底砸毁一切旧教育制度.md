    The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and teachers and students of military academies unanimously expressed that they will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and completely smash all old education systems.
    This great reform of the college entrance examination system is a good and thorough reform, with great historical significance. It concerns the century-long and millennium-long plan of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and completely reflects the wishes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and teachers and students of military academies were all delighted and inspired upon seeing the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on reforming the college entrance examination methods, shouting "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" Many units of commanders and fighters immediately held discussions, expressing their firm support for this wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.
    The broad masses of commanders and fighters all said that this great reform of the college entrance examination system is a good and thorough reform, with great historical significance. It concerns the century-long and millennium-long plan of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and completely reflects the wishes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Cheng Yunzhang, an assistant of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, said that the proletarian education policy and the bourgeois education policy are diametrically opposed. Anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought bourgeois representatives, taking advantage of the education positions they occupied, opposed the education line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. They were not cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause but cultivating successors for their restoration of capitalism. To eradicate the poisonous roots of revisionism, we must completely smash this old education system. The Party Committee of the Air Force Military Academy held a special meeting to discuss this decision and the relevant People's Daily editorial, unanimously expressing firm support for the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Everyone believes that schools are an important front for the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to compete for the younger generation. Thoroughly eliminating the old education system is a revolution to eradicate the poisonous roots of revisionism. We must thoroughly carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely implement the education line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and build schools into important positions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Some soldiers from intellectual youth backgrounds also used their own experiences to angrily denounce the crimes of the old education system in spreading large amounts of capitalist and revisionist poisons to young people, expressing their determination to resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and completely smash all old education systems in this Cultural Revolution movement. Yang Jidong, a student of a certain naval engineering academy, said that the old education system lured young people to pursue personal fame, gain, and status, leading them into the wrong path of bourgeois individualism. This reactionary education system has poisoned countless young people. We completely support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and must resolutely and thoroughly smash it! Wang Jiagui, a soldier of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region and a high school graduate, said that the old education system completely violated Chairman Mao's principle of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. It deprived a large number of outstanding workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary soldiers, and children of revolutionary martyrs of the right to enroll in schools. It led young people onto the evil path of burying themselves in books and not asking about politics. Only by wielding the "powerful cudgel" of Mao Zedong Thought can we completely smash this education system that serves the bourgeoisie and revisionism through and through.
    Many commanders and fighters of the troops and teachers and students of military academies expressed great support and praise for the heroic spirit and fearless revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary young students of Class 4, Grade 3 of Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School and Class 5, Grade 3 of Beijing No. 4 Middle School, who dared to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to break through, and dare to make revolution. Commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region said that this revolutionary initiative dealt a head-on blow to bourgeois "experts," "authorities," and all demons and monsters. This blow was accurate, ruthless, and delightful! The youth of the Mao Zedong era must be revolutionary vanguards, daring to rebel against the bourgeoisie, daring to dismantle the old system, and daring to smash the old world to pieces! We, the people's soldiers, resolutely support this most thorough revolutionary action of revolutionary young students. Many soldiers also said: We warmly welcome revolutionary young students to come among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, let us grow and develop together in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment, and in the midst of great storms, truly become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, take over and pass on the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

    解放军广大指战员和军事院校教职学员一致表示
    坚决听毛主席的话，彻底砸毁一切旧教育制度
    这次高等学校招生考试制度的大改革，改得好，改得彻底，具有伟大的历史意义，是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的百年大计，万年大计，完全反映了工农兵的心愿
    新华社十九日讯　中国人民解放军广大指战员和军事院校教职学员，看到中共中央、国务院关于改革高等学校招生考试办法的决定，无不欢欣鼓舞，高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”很多部队指战员并立即举行座谈，表示坚决拥护党中央和国务院这一英明的决定。
    广大指战员都说，这次高等学校招生考试制度的大改革，改得好，改得彻底，具有伟大的历史意义，是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的百年大计，万年大计，完全反映了我们工农兵的心愿。广州部队某部助理员程云章说，无产阶级的教育方针和资产阶级的教育方针，是针锋相对的。反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物，利用他们盘踞的教育阵地，与党中央和毛主席制定的教育路线相对抗，他们不是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，而是培养为他们复辟资本主义事业的接班人。要挖掉修正主义的毒根，就必须彻底砸烂这一套旧的教育制度。空军军校部党委专门开会，座谈讨论了这个决定和《人民日报》的有关社论，一致表示坚决拥护党中央、国务院的决定。大家认为，学校是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺青年一代的重要阵地，彻底破除旧的教育制度，是挖掉修正主义毒根的革命。我们一定要彻底搞好这场无产阶级文化大革命，坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席制定的教育路线，把学校办成培养高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要阵地。
    一些知识青年出身的战士，还用自己的亲身经历，愤怒控诉旧的教育制度向青年大量散布资本主义、修正主义毒素的罪行，表示要坚决听毛主席的话，在这场文化大革命运动中，把一切旧的教育制度彻底打碎。海军某工程学院学员杨继东说，旧的教育制度，引诱青年追逐个人名利地位，把青年引入资产阶级个人主义的歧途。这种反动的教育制度，不知毒害了多少青年。我们完全拥护党中央、毛主席的英明决定，必须坚决彻底砸烂它！广州部队某部战士、高中毕业生汪家桂说，旧的教育制度，是完全违背毛主席培养造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的原则的，它剥夺了大量优秀的工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命军人和革命烈士的子女入学的权利。它把青年引导到埋头读书、不问政治的邪路上去。对这种彻头彻尾地为资产阶级、修正主义效劳的教育制度，只有抡起毛泽东思想的“千钧棒”，才能把它彻底打碎。
    许多部队指战员和军事院校教职学员，对北京女一中高三（四）班和北京四中高三（五）班革命青年学生，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命的英雄气概和大无畏的革命精神，表示极大的支持和赞扬。沈阳部队某部指战员说，这个革命倡议，使资产阶级“专家”、“权威”和一切牛鬼蛇神挨了当头一棒，这一棒打得准，打得狠，打得痛快！毛泽东时代的青年，就是要当革命的闯将，敢造资产阶级的反，敢拆旧制度的台，敢把旧世界砸个稀烂！我们人民战士，坚决支持革命青年学生这种最彻底的革命行动。许多部队战士还表示：热烈欢迎革命青年学生，到广大工农兵群众中来，让我们一起在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的三大革命运动中，在大风大浪里锻炼成长，真正做无产阶级革命事业的接班人，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗接过来，传下去，把社会主义革命进行到底！
