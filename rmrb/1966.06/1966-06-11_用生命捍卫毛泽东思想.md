    Defend Mao Zedong Thought with Our Lives
    The son of martyrs Peng Yongwu and Jiang Zhuyun (Sister Jiang) Peng Yun
    Currently, I am participating in the Socialist Education Movement in the countryside. When the Party Central Committee decided to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and the newly reorganized Beijing University Party Committee decided to reorganize the Beijing University Party Committee, we were extremely excited. We resolutely support this wise decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! Uprooting the poisonous roots of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang and destroying their reactionary strongholds where they stubbornly resisted is truly gratifying. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    These days, the upsurge of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, which is vigorously developing across the country, has been stirring our hearts. What "Three-Family Village," "Four-Family Village," what "scholars," "authorities," and their backstage bosses, these demons and monsters collude with each other, frantically attacking our greatest Party, attacking our most beloved Chairman Mao, and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This has long filled us with righteous indignation and uncontrollable anger. The kind of ambition they harbor is becoming increasingly clear: they are妄想妄想 to realize capitalist restoration in China. They understand that if the broad revolutionary masses master Mao Zedong Thought, their dream of restoration will never be realized. Therefore, they desperately oppose Mao Zedong Thought.
    I want to tell these guys: if you dare to touch a single hair of Mao Zedong Thought, you will end up shattered to pieces!
    I am the son of a revolutionary martyr. My parents and countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives to defend Mao Zedong Thought, for the victory of Mao Zedong Thought in China and around the world.
    During their lives, my father and mother infinitely admired and loved Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's works. At that time, it was not easy for comrades doing underground work in the White Areas to see Chairman Mao's books. They treasured every mimeographed and handwritten copy of Chairman Mao's works as if they had obtained a priceless treasure. Although they had to go to work during the day in public and do Party work until late at night, they were very busy and tired, but they still read Chairman Mao's books greedily, over and over again, reciting Chairman Mao's words word by word and keeping them firmly in their hearts. They were convinced that only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought could the victory of the Chinese revolution be achieved. I clearly remember that a comrade-in-arms of my mother's once taught me: "In the past revolutionary struggles, whenever we acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we were invincible, attacked without defeat, fought without defeat, and the struggle would develop smoothly. Whenever we violated Chairman Mao's instructions, we would lose our way, take detours, and the struggle would suffer setbacks. We recognized Mao Zedong Thought with the price of life and blood and established a flesh-and-blood relationship with Mao Zedong Thought."
    In the demonic caves like Zhazidong and Baigongguan, my mother and her comrades-in-arms, avoiding the enemy's strict surveillance, overcoming various difficulties, and risking their lives, still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. They felt that Chairman Mao was by their side every moment, and the thought of Chairman Mao generated the power to overwhelm all enemies and defeat all enemies. The enemy subjected my mother to severe torture, driving bamboo sticks into her fingertips, but she did not groan at all. Her answer to the enemy was: "Bamboo sticks are made of bamboo, but the will of a Communist Party member is made of steel!" This iron-like will and endless power came from Mao Zedong Thought. Before going to the execution ground, my mother was so calm, "her face did not change color, her heart did not beat," she firmly believed that Mao Zedong Thought would surely achieve the final victory in China and around the world.
    My father and mother left me nothing else, they left me the legacy of inheriting their cause, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, protecting the country, and carrying the revolution through to the end. In her posthumous letter, my mother told me: "Hope to teach (Yun'er) to follow in the footsteps of his parents, to be determined to build a new China, and to struggle to the end for the cause of the communist revolution!" Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, I have grown up. The Party's education has made me understand why my parents sacrificed themselves, understand my responsibilities, and made me determined to struggle to the end for the complete victory of Mao Zedong Thought in China and the world. After I entered university, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to study the main course of class struggle well, I joined the army in the company, participated in the Socialist Education Movement in the countryside, experienced storms and faced the world in class struggle, studied Mao Zedong Thought in the three great revolutionary movements, and strived to temper myself into a revolutionary as the Party expects. Last December, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. I deeply feel that without the Party and Chairman Mao, I would have nothing. I have infinite love and infinite faith in Chairman Mao.
    In prison, my mother excitedly held the five-star red flag embroidered by her comrades and said to the "flower of the prison": "Child! Grow up quickly! Uncles and aunts will raise this red flag to participate in the battle, and they will personally hand the red flag over to you. Child, you must remember: when you grow up, when your children also receive the red flag from your hands one day, you must face the red flag and answer—whether you were born to defend the red flag, fought to defend the red flag, and contributed a lifetime of no regrets to defend the red flag."
    Now, it is time for our generation to take over the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought from our parents.
    However, those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee came out to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, implementing a revisionist line, and attempting to restore capitalism. If the conspiracy of these demons and monsters succeeds, wouldn't our country change its color? Wouldn't thousands of Zhazidong and Baigongguan reappear on the land of our motherland, which was exchanged for the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs?!
    The blood of the martyrs will not be shed in vain, the blood of the martyrs must not be shed in vain! I must firmly remember my mother's words, live to defend the red flag, fight to defend the red flag, and dedicate my lifetime of no regrets to defend the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought! Defend Mao Zedong Thought with my own life, be a proletarian revolutionary, and fight to the end to completely eliminate all demons and monsters and to win the victory of the Socialist Cultural Revolution.

### 用生命捍卫毛泽东思想

    用生命捍卫毛泽东思想
　　烈士彭咏梧和江竹筠（江姐）的儿子　彭云
    现在，我正在农村参加社会主义教育运动。当党中央决定改组北京市委，和新改组的北京市委决定改组北京大学党委的消息传到这里后，我们兴奋极了。我们坚决拥护党中央和毛主席这个英明的决定！拔掉了“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮的毒根，捣毁了他们负隅顽抗的反动堡垒，真是大快人心。这是毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利。
    这些日子，在全国蓬勃开展的社会主义文化大革命的热潮，一直在激动着我们的心，什么“三家村”“四家村”，什么“学者”“权威”，还有他们的后台老板，这些牛鬼蛇神串通一气，疯狂地攻击我们最伟大的党，攻击我们最敬爱的毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这早就使我们义愤填膺，怒不可遏了。他们存着什么样的野心，越来看得越清楚了：他们妄想在中国实现资本主义复辟。他们心里明白，广大的革命群众如果掌握了毛泽东思想，他们的复辟美梦就永生永世也得不到实现了。所以，他们拚命地反对毛泽东思想。
    我要告诉这些家伙：你们胆敢碰毛泽东思想一根毫毛，就让你们落个粉身碎骨的下场！
    我是一个革命烈士的儿子，我的父母和无数革命先烈为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了毛泽东思想在全中国和全世界的胜利，献出了他们的生命。
    我的父亲和母亲在生前，无限崇敬无限热爱毛主席和毛主席的著作。当时，在白区做地下工作的同志不容易看到毛主席的书，他们每得到一本油印和手抄的毛主席著作，简直如获至宝。虽然白天要以公开身份上班做事，晚上做党的工作直到深夜，忙得很，累得很，可还是一遍又一遍如饥似渴地读着毛主席的书，一字一句把毛主席的话背诵下来，牢牢记在心里。他们认准了，只有高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，才能取得中国革命的胜利。我清楚地记得，母亲生前的一位战友曾经教导我说：“在过去的革命斗争中，凡是按照毛主席的指示去办事的时候，我们就所向无敌，攻无不克，战无不胜，斗争就会顺利发展。凡是违背了毛主席的指示的时候，我们就要迷失方向，就要走弯路，斗争就要受到挫折。我们是用生命和鲜血的代价认识了毛泽东思想，和毛泽东思想建立了血肉相联的感情。”
    母亲和她的战友们，在渣滓洞和白公馆那样的魔窟中，避开敌人的严密监视，克服种种困难，冒着生命危险，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作。他们感到毛主席每时每刻都在自己身边，一想到毛主席就产生了压倒一切敌人、战胜一切敌人的力量。敌人对母亲进行严刑拷打，把一根根竹签子钉进她的指尖，她没有一丝丝呻吟，对敌人的回答是：“竹签子是竹子做的，但是共产党员的意志是钢的！”她这钢铁般的意志和无穷的力量就是从毛泽东思想中来的。母亲在赴刑场就义之前是那么从容，“脸不变色，心不跳”，她坚信毛泽东思想一定能在全中国和全世界取得最后的胜利。
    父亲和母亲没有给我留下别的，他们给我留下的是继承他们的事业，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，保住江山，将革命进行到底的遗志。母亲在遗书中告诉我：“盼教以（云儿）踏着父母之足迹，以建设新中国为志，为共产主义革命事业奋斗到底！”在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，我成长起来了。党的教育使我懂得了父母是为什么牺牲的，懂得了自己的责任，使我下定了为毛泽东思想在中国和全世界彻底胜利而奋斗到底的决心。我考上大学以后，按照毛主席要上好阶级斗争这门主课的指示，到连队当兵，到农村参加社会主义教育运动，在阶级斗争中经风雨见世面，在三大革命运动中学习毛泽东思想，努力把自己锻炼成为党所期望的那样的革命者。去年十二月，我光荣地加入了中国共产党。我深深地感到，没有党和毛主席就没有我的一切，我对毛主席无限热爱无限信仰。
    母亲在狱中激动地拿着同志们绣好的五星红旗对“监狱之花”说：“孩子啊！快点长大吧！叔叔娘娘们将举起这面红旗，去参加战斗，还要亲手将红旗交付给你。孩子啊，你要记着：当你长大了，当你的孩子也从你的手上接过红旗那天，你要面对红旗回答——你是否为保卫红旗而生，为保卫红旗而战，为保卫红旗而贡献了问心无愧的一生。”
    现在，是我们这一代人从父辈手中接过毛泽东思想伟大红旗的时候了。
    可是，北京前市委中那些反党反社会主义分子出来反对毛泽东思想，打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马列主义外衣，执行修正主义的路线，妄想复辟资本主义。如果让这些牛鬼蛇神的阴谋得逞，我们的国家不就改变了颜色吗？在我们无数革命先烈流血牺牲换来的祖国大地上，不又会出现千百个渣滓洞和白公馆吗？！
    烈士的鲜血不会白流，烈士的鲜血不能白流！我要牢牢记着母亲的话，为保卫红旗而生，为保卫红旗而战，为保卫毛泽东思想伟大红旗而贡献自己问心无愧的一生！用自己的生命捍卫毛泽东思想，做无产阶级革命派，为彻底扫除一切牛鬼蛇神，为取得社会主义文化大革命的胜利斗争到底。
