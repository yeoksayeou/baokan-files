Chairmanship, delegates,

	We come from the war-torn South Vietnam to participate in the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against imperialist aggression. On behalf of the South Vietnamese writers who are fighting alongside their compatriots against American imperialism and its lackeys, and on behalf of the 14 million people of South Vietnam who stand at the forefront of the world's people in opposing American imperialism, we extend our warmest congratulations to the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression, and we wish the meeting every success.

	Chairmanship, delegates,

	American imperialism is blatantly waging a war of aggression against Vietnam. They are trampling on the sacred national rights of the Vietnamese people, namely independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. They are using 265,000 American troops, 30,000 mercenary troops, and 500,000 puppet troops to carry out round-the-clock destruction, raids, and massacres, in an attempt to force our compatriots to surrender to them. However, the 14 million people of South Vietnam are resolutely fighting to the end against American imperialism and its lackeys to defend our national rights. Our compatriots have already resolutely taken up arms to fight against American imperialism and have already inflicted heavy defeats on it. In the last few months of 1965 and the beginning of 1966, the military and people of South Vietnam have annihilated more than 20 main force battalions of the Americans. This shows that the American army is not as strong as they boast. The actual situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam has proven that the American army can be defeated. Our military and people have already defeated and will completely defeat the American imperialist aggressor troops.

	The reason we have achieved victories in our struggle against American imperialist aggression is mainly due to the spirit of self-reliance, fearlessness of sacrifice, and hard work among the military and people of South Vietnam. These victories are inseparable from the active support and fearlessness of sacrifice and hard work of our compatriots in North Vietnam. Our victories are also inseparable from the support of the people of socialist countries, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people of the world who love peace.

	The convening of this meeting is a powerful proof of the support of the peoples of Asian and African countries for our people's just struggle against American imperialist aggression. The fact that this meeting is held in the capital of the great People's Republic of China, Beijing, also proves that in our struggle against American imperialist aggression, the great 650 million Chinese people have always stood with us and actively supported us. We express our gratitude to the preparatory committee of this meeting and the Chinese Writers Association for initiating the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression. We express our gratitude to the representatives from various countries who, despite the long distances, have come here to participate in the meeting in support of our people's just struggle. Through you, our delegation extends our heartfelt thanks to the writers and people of your countries for their active support for our people who are fighting against American imperialism.

	Delegates,

	You come from different countries, but you share a common sentiment, which is the sentiment for the people who are fighting against American imperialist aggression. It is this noble and beautiful sentiment that has prompted you to come here, despite the long distances, to support our people. We believe that this sentiment will unite us into a powerful force in the common struggle against the number one enemy of modern humanity—American imperialism.

	Our delegation brings the deep gratitude of the 14 million people of South Vietnam who are shedding blood to defend their national rights and stop American imperialist aggression. We are very honored to represent our people in accepting your and your countries' people's sentiments for our people at this meeting. Our delegation is willing to contribute all our strength to the success of the meeting. We once again sincerely thank the Chinese friends for their tremendous contributions to the preparation of the meeting and for providing extremely abundant material conditions for the meeting.

	We wish the delegates good health,
	We wish the meeting complete success.

    越南南方代表团长陈庭云的致词主席团，各位代表，
    我们从战火纷飞的越南南方来到这里，参加支持越南人民反对帝国主义侵略的亚非作家紧急会议。我们谨代表正在与自己的同胞并肩战斗，抗击美帝国主义及其走狗的越南南方作家，代表站在世界人民反对美帝国主义的前线的一千四百万越南南方人民，向支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的亚非作家紧急会议致以热烈的祝贺，并祝会议获得成功。
    主席团，各位代表，
    美帝国主义正在明目张胆地进行侵略越南的战争。他们正在践踏越南人民神圣的民族权利，即独立、主权、统一和领土完整。他们正在使用二十六万五千名美国军队，三万仆从军队和五十万伪军，不分昼夜地进行破坏、扫荡和残杀，妄图迫使我们的同胞向他们屈服。但是，我们一千四百万越南南方人民坚决斗争到底，反对美帝国主义及其走狗，以保卫自己民族的权利。我们的同胞已经坚决地拿起武器，进行反对美帝国主义的战斗，并已使它遭到沉重的失败。在一九六五年底和一九六六年初的几个月中，越南南方军民已经全歼了美国主力军二十多个营。这表明，美国军队并不象是他们自己所吹嘘的那样强大。越南南方战场的实际情况已经证明，美国军队是可以打败的。我们的军民已经打败并且必将完全打败美帝国主义的侵略军队。
    我们在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中之所以取得胜利，主要是由于我们越南南方军民有着自力更生、不怕牺牲、艰苦奋斗的精神。这些胜利与我们越南北方同胞的积极支持和不怕牺牲、艰苦奋斗也是分不开的。我们的胜利与社会主义各国人民，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，和全世界爱好和平的人民的支持也是分不开的。
    这次会议的召开是亚非各国人民支持我国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争的一个有力证明。这次会议在伟大的中华人民共和国的首都北京召开，也证明了在我们反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，伟大的六亿五千万中国人民始终和我们站在一起，并且积极地支持我们。我们对这次会议的筹备委员会和中国作家协会表示感谢，感谢他们倡议召开支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的亚非作家紧急会议。我们对不顾路途遥远而到这里参加支持我国人民正义斗争的会议的各国代表们表示感谢，通过你们，我们代表团谨向你们国家的作家和人民表示深切的感谢，感谢他们对正在进行反对美帝国主义斗争的我国人民的积极支持。
    各位代表，
    你们来自不同的国家，但是你们有着共同的感情，这就是对于我们正在进行反对美帝国主义侵略的人民的感情。正是这种崇高美好的感情，促使你们不怕路途遥远，来到这里支持我们的人民。我们相信，这种感情将在反对现代人类的头号敌人——美帝国主义的共同斗争中，把我们团结成一支强大的队伍。
    我们代表团给会议带来了为保卫自己的民族权利和制止美帝国主义侵略而流血的一千四百万越南南方人民的深切感谢，我们为能够代表我们人民在这次会议中接受你们和你们国家人民对于我们人民的感情而感到非常荣幸。我们代表团愿为会议的成功而贡献出自己的全部力量。我们再一次真诚地感谢中国朋友为会议的筹备和为会议提供极其充裕的一切物质条件而作出的巨大贡献。
    我们谨祝代表们身体健康，
    谨祝会议取得完满成功。
