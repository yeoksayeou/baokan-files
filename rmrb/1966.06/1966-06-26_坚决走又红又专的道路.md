    In early 1964, several young teachers and graduate students visited Kuang Yaming, wanting him to talk to us about how to take the road of being both red and expert. How did the wolfish Kuang Yaming answer our questions?
    One graduate student asked him, "How can a graduate student be 'red'?"
    Kuang Yaming didn't answer the question directly, but instead asked, "Did you get 100 marks in every subject?" The graduate student replied, "No." Kuang Yaming said, "First you must get 100 marks in every subject, even 105 marks. If you get 105 marks in every subject, I will approve your Party membership. Thirty years later, if I am dead, and you achieve something, you can come to my grave and tell me." See, the anti-Party element Kuang Yaming used bourgeois ideology to corrupt, poison, and lure us young people, wholeheartedly wanting to turn us into successors of the bourgeoisie.
    Kuang Yaming also said, "China has been liberated for more than ten years, but has not yet cultivated a good professor. Everyone should pay attention to this issue. There is a young professor who returned from the United States who is very capable in teaching and business. As soon as he returned, he could take charge and solve many problems." This is a slander against our Party and socialism. Since liberation, our country has cultivated a large number of proletarian experts and talents. They have played a huge role in socialist construction and have achieved many results that bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" could not do, or even dare to think about. But the anti-Party element Kuang Yaming viciously slandered and attacked us for not cultivating a professor! At the same time, this also exposed his shameless flattery of the evil American imperialism, a complete lackey's face!
    Another comrade asked, "What if there is a contradiction between time for professional work and political study?"
    Kuang Yaming replied, "If you feel it is necessary for your professional work, you can participate in less political study, or even not read newspapers for a period of time. If someone opposes it, you must resist." In Kuang Yaming's view, in order to be "expert," it is okay not to read newspapers, and it is okay not to participate in political study! He opposes highlighting proletarian politics and also wants us to ignore proletarian politics and take the bourgeois road of being white and expert!
    When a comrade asked, "How can we study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind and achieve immediate results?" Kuang Yaming took the opportunity to viciously slander Chairman Mao's works.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and the people study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way with strong class feelings, achieving immediate results and generating unparalleled powerful forces, creating brilliant miracles, and frightening all demons and monsters. The bourgeois representative Kuang Yaming bitterly hates Chairman Mao's works because Chairman Mao's works are a powerful weapon for defeating all class enemies. The more the enemy scolds Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study Chairman Mao's works, study them for a lifetime, and use them for a lifetime.
    In such a short conversation, the anti-Party element Kuang Yaming released so much poison! He vainly attempted to lead us young people to the dead end of revisionism to serve capitalist restoration. We resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and take the road of being both red and expert. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle accounts with Kuang Yaming's crimes against the Party and socialism, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    坚决走又红又专的道路
    一九六四年初，我们几个青年教师和研究生走访匡亚明，要他给我们谈谈如何走又红又专的道路。狼子野心的匡亚明是怎样回答我们的问题的？
    一个研究生问他：“做一个研究生，怎样才能红？”
    匡亚明不直接回答问题，却反问一句：“你是不是每门功课都考一百分了？”那位研究生回答说：“没有。”匡亚明说：“你首先就要做到每门课都考一百分，甚至考一百零五分。你每门课都考了一百零五分，我就批准你入党。三十年之后，如果我死了，你做出成绩来，你就到我坟上来告诉我一下。”看，反党分子匡亚明就是这样用资产阶级思想腐蚀毒害和诱骗我们青年，一心想把我们变成资产阶级的接班人。
    匡亚明又说：“中国解放十多年了，还没有培养出一个好的教授来。大家都要重视这个问题。有一个从美国回来的年轻教授，教学业务上就是行。他一回来就能独当一面，做领导工作，解决不少问题。”这是对我们党和社会主义的污蔑。解放以来，我国培养了大批无产阶级专家和人材。他们在社会主义建设中发挥了巨大的作用，他们做出了许多资产阶级“专家”、“权威”所做不到、甚至连想都不敢想的成绩。而反党分子匡亚明却恶毒地污蔑和攻击我们没有培养出一个教授！同时，这也暴露了他无耻地吹捧万恶的美帝国主义的一副十足的奴才相！
    又一个同志问：“业务与政治学习时间上有矛盾怎么办？”
    匡亚明回答说：“假如你觉得业务上需要，可以少参加一些政治学习，甚至在一段时间内不看报纸也行。有人反对的话，你要顶住。”在匡亚明看来，为了专，不看报也行，不参加政治学习也行！他反对突出无产阶级政治，也要我们不问无产阶级政治，走资产阶级白专道路！
    当有一个同志问：“怎样带着问题学毛主席著作，做到立竿见影”的时候，匡亚明趁机恶毒地污蔑毛主席著作。
    我国广大工农兵和人民群众带着强烈的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，立竿见影，产生了无比强大的力量，创造了光辉灿烂的奇迹，使一切牛鬼蛇神丧胆。资产阶级代表人物匡亚明刻骨地仇视毛主席著作，就是因为毛主席著作是战胜一切阶级敌人的强大武器。敌人愈骂毛主席著作，我们愈要学习毛主席著作，学一辈子，用一辈子。
    这样短短的一次谈话，反党分子匡亚明竟放出了这么多毒！他妄想把我们青年引向修正主义的死路上去，为资本主义复辟服务。我们坚决听毛主席的话，走又红又专的道路。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清算匡亚明反党反社会主义的罪行，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
