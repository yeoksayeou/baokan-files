    In 1961, the Cultural Relics Publishing House reprinted "Song Sima Guang's Draft of Zizhi Tongjian." Jian Bozan wrote a postscript for this fragment of only four hundred and sixty words, titled "Learning Sima Guang's Spirit of Compiling the 'Tongjian'." He used this as an opportunity to greatly praise Sima Guang and his compiled "Tongjian," calling "Tongjian" "the most successful collective writing of a general history," and praising Sima Guang as a "good model" for "chief editing" history. Jian Bozan praised this "chief editor's" "responsible attitude and rigorous spirit of historical research," and repeatedly praised his "sincerity, honesty, loyalty, and dignified bearing," and that "the learning of honesty and non-deception can be found everywhere." Jian Bozan concocted a "Sima Guang Spirit" and loudly called on us to learn from it. Why is this?
    We know that from 1959 to 1962, a wave of restorationist thinking emerged in China's cultural and academic circles, and the voices praising emperors, generals, "honest officials," "good officials," literati, and scholars were clamorous for a time. Wu Han and Jian Bozan were the most active representatives. Wu Han wrote extensively about Hai Rui, portraying this landlord class bureaucrat as the people's "savior" and a towering "hero," concocting a "Hai Rui Spirit," and calling on people to learn from Hai Rui. Jian Bozan, on the other hand, brought out Sima Guang, depicting this reactionary and conservative "chancellor" as a person with a "dignified bearing" and "virtues," praising him as a "model" in the field of history. The two have similar goals by different routes. Wu Han used Hai Rui's image to reverse the verdicts on right-leaning opportunists; Jian Bozan used Sima Guang's ghost to resist the historical revolution. They were both using the corpse of feudalism to restore the soul of capitalism.
    In 1958, a great revolution unfolded on the historical front. Revolutionary historical workers, especially the younger generation who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, declared war on emperors, generals, and ministers with a dauntless revolutionary spirit, declared war on all feudal and capitalist historical traditions, and declared war on all "historical authorities" who clung to the past and refused to let go of the imperial genealogy. They set about rewriting history with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, striving to reverse the history that had been overturned by the exploiting classes and restore the laboring people to their position as masters of history. Some historical workers began to leave their studies and combine with the workers and peasants to write the history of the heroic struggles of the workers and peasants against class enemies, so that history began to become a powerful weapon for class education, serving the politics of the proletariat.
    The torrent of the historical revolution angered some "scholars" and "experts." They felt that this torrent would eventually shake their position of "authority" and eventually wash away the academic bully's throne they had held for many years. They were restless and "had a bone stuck in their throats," and had to come out and speak. Jian Bozan acted as the vanguard against the historical revolution, trying to stop the advance of the revolutionary torrent.
    Jian Bozan wantonly vilified the historical revolution and criticized the revolutionary achievements. He said that the revolutionary historical research work was "empty talk about some principles," "dryly quoting some dogmas," and "distorting or even severing specific history," resulting in history "becoming a monotonous, rigid, and dry dogma, turning into a desert"; "one-sidedness, abstraction, simplification, absolutization, and modernization are the prominent shortcomings in historical teaching and research in recent years." Jian Bozan said that the historical revolution and its achievements were worthless, simply terrible.
    Jian Bozan fabricated various drawbacks of the historical revolution, and then attributed the root cause of the drawbacks to "using theory to lead history," that is, to using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to guide historical research. He ridiculed the revolutionary historical workers, saying that their "entire task is to select sentences from classic works, and to repeatedly repeat these sentences," "just revolving around the general principles or even sentences of Marxism-Leninism," "finding a classic work to be their bodyguard." Revolutionary historical workers were mocked as lazy people who only "open their mouths to receive" "roast turkey." Jian Bozan openly opposed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for historical research, and nonsense that the slogan of "using theory to lead history" was "one-sided," "wrong," and "should be abolished."
    In fact, Jian Bozan was selling his private goods of "historical data is history" under the guise of opposing "dogmatism." He said: "Materials are the source of knowledge," "Rejecting historical materials is rejecting historical knowledge," and so on. He also alarmistly said that opposing "historical data is history" is to oppose historical data together with the bourgeoisie, which is tantamount to saying that "the bourgeoisie must be based on evidence and be trustworthy, while the proletariat is just talking nonsense and speaking casually."
    Jian Bozan here is simply trying to say: What's so great about you? You have Marxism-Leninism as "lace," "label," and "bodyguard," but it is still useless; you still have to come with me, delve into old paper piles, prostrate yourselves at the feet of the ancients, and live by picking up the ancients' leftovers. In order to sell anti-Marxist historical views, Jian Bozan brought out the idol of Sima Guang. Jian Bozan, who once said "do not insinuate, use the past to shoot at the present or use the present to shoot at the past," was now using Sima Guang's name to praise the past and criticize the present, opposing the historical revolution.
    Jian Bozan, on the one hand, said that revolutionary historical workers were "lazy people," and that the booming revolution on the historical front was "careless and hasty," and on the other hand, praised Sima Guang's "responsible attitude" and "rigorous spirit" of "not being sloppy with his writing," saying that Sima Guang's spirit "is the best education for those who treat writing history with a careless and hasty attitude." He purposefully quoted Yuan Dynasty scholar Huang Jin: "Today's literati tend to value agility, praise lightness and despise gravity, and even if Wen Gong were reborn, he might not be able to catch up with them." Jian Bozan desperately praised Sima Guang in order to have "Wen Gong reborn" to resist the historical revolution.
    Jian Bozan, on the one hand, vigorously slandered the historical revolution and its achievements as "empty," "dry," "monotonous, rigid, and dry," and on the other hand, greatly praised "Tongjian": "In narration, it extracts the essence, and in writing, it simplifies the complicated, is loose but not revealing, and concise and concise. Every word is based on evidence, with no empty words; every event is verifiable, with no speculation; the writing is refined, with no superfluous words." On the one hand, he said that revolutionary historical workers were worthless, and on the other hand, he elevated Sima Guang to the sky, praising feudal history. What Jian Bozan opposes, what he supports, what he hates, and what he loves, is it not clear?
    In order to abolish the mass movement led by the Party on the historical front and to resist the Party's mass line, Jian Bozan put forward a thoroughgoing bourgeois expert line. He said that to write history, one must be like Sima Guang, "inviting" several "friends who have specialized research and are like-minded" to form a "small" "collective," these people "have the ability to independently deal with historical problems," "can write drafts that are basically at the academic level of the time," and these people are "famous historians at the time." In other words, to write history, it can only be cold and deserted, and it must be done by a few "experts" and "scholars." Let us see what Jian Bozan's claims are:
    "Invite yourself." That is, an attempt to abolish the Party's leadership over academics, oppose the Party's leadership, and allow a few "experts" to act arbitrarily. This kind of argument is not new at all. As early as 1957, bourgeois rightists did not advocate fallacies such as "professors governing schools"? Jian Bozan was just picking up some junk from the garbage heap.
      "Like-minded." Those who can agree with Jian Bozan are certainly not Marxists, and what is left can only be some bourgeois historians who can have a similar smell and collude with each other. The result of their cooperation must be to oppose taking Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, jointly beautify emperors, generals, and ministers, and slander the peasant revolution, and so on.
      "Specialized research" and so on. In fact, it is to put on a "expert's" "majestic" face to scare and suppress the new forces, suppress and exclude young revolutionary historical workers. Because in Jian Bozan's view, the "lazy people" who are disdainful are not qualified to enter the academic "kingdom" they control.
      "Famous historians at the time" are worthy of being members of writing history. These people must be like those invited by Sima Guang, "knowledgeable, able to write articles," "knowing everything," and "well-versed in all kinds of books." So, who can win Jian Bozan's respect today? Isn't it the bourgeois "authorities" such as Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Jian Bozan? What kind of history can these "historians" write? Isn't the answer already obvious!
    From the above analysis, it can be seen that Jian Bozan put forward the "Sima Guang Spirit" entirely to oppose the historical revolution, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, oppose the Party's leadership, and oppose the mass movement in historical work. In fact, in 1961, Jian Bozan regarded himself as Sima Guang, invited a group of "like-minded" "experts" and "scholars," and with the so-called "Sima Guang Spirit," began to write the "Outline of Chinese History." This book is a poisonous arrow for the bourgeoisie to attack us, and a tool for them to promote peaceful evolution and attempt to restore capitalism. Does this not clearly tell us that the "Sima Guang Spirit" praised by Jian Bozan is a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary spirit. We must resolutely smash it.

    翦伯赞为什么吹捧“司马光精神”？
    武汉大学历史系学生　张后铨
    一九六一年，文物出版社影印了《宋司马光通鉴稿》。翦伯赞为这个只有四百六十余字的残稿，以《学习司马光编写〈通鉴〉的精神》为题写了一篇跋。他借题发挥，对司马光及其所编《通鉴》大加吹捧，称赞《通鉴》“是一部最成功的集体写作的通史”，称赞司马光为“主编”历史的“很好的模范”。翦伯赞颂扬这位“主编”的“负责态度和治史的严谨精神”，并且一再颂扬他“诚笃忠厚，气象凛然”，“惟公不欺之学，何往而不在哉”。翦伯赞炮制出一个“司马光精神”，并且大声疾呼地号召我们向它学习，这究竟是为什么呢？
    我们知道，在一九五九年至一九六二年期间，我国文化学术界出现了一股复古主义的思潮，颂扬帝王将相、“清官”“好官”、文人学士的声浪喧嚣一时。吴晗和翦伯赞是最活跃的代表。吴晗连篇累牍地宣传海瑞，把这个地主阶级的官僚渲染为人民的“救星”、顶天立地的“英雄”，炮制出“海瑞精神”，号召人们向海瑞学习。翦伯赞则抬出司马光，把这个反动保守的“丞相”，描写成“气象凛然”有“美德”的人物，歌颂他是史学界的“模范”。二者确实有异曲同工之妙。吴晗用海瑞的躯壳为右倾机会主义分子翻案；翦伯赞用司马光的亡灵来对抗史学革命。他们都是借封建主义之尸，还资本主义之魂。
    一九五八年，史学战线上展开了一场大革命。革命的史学工作者、特别是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的年轻一代，以大无畏的革命精神，向帝王将相宣战，向一切封建的、资本主义的史学传统宣战，向一切抱残守缺、死抱住帝王家谱不放的“史学权威”们宣战。他们着手用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来重新改写历史，力图把被剥削阶级所颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来，恢复劳动人民在历史上的主人翁地位。一部分史学工作者开始走出书斋，与工农群众相结合，编写工农群众同阶级敌人英勇斗争的历史，使历史学开始成为阶级教育的有力武器，为无产阶级的政治服务。
    史学革命的洪流把一些“学者”“专家”们触怒了。他们感到，这一股洪流终将摇撼他们的“权威”地位，终将冲垮他们把持了多年的学阀宝座。他们坐卧不安，“骨鲠在喉”，非出来讲话不可。翦伯赞充当了反对史学革命的急先锋，极力阻挡革命的洪流的前进。
    翦伯赞对史学革命肆意诋毁，对革命成果横加非议。他说什么革命的史学研究工作，是“空洞洞说一些原理原则”，“干巴巴引用一些教条”，“歪曲甚至割裂具体的历史”，结果是使历史“变成了单调、僵死和干燥无味的教条，变成了一片沙漠”；“片面性、抽象性、简单化、绝对化、现代化，是这几年历史教学和研究中突出的缺点”。翦伯赞把史学革命及其成果说得一无是处，简直是糟透了。
    翦伯赞捏造了史学革命的种种弊病，然后把产生弊病的根源归咎于“以论带史”，即归咎于用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来指导历史研究。他讥讽革命史学工作者的“全部任务就在于挑选经典著作中的文句，就在于一再重复这些文句”，“只是围绕着马列主义的一般原理原则甚至文句转来转去”，“找一句经典著作来保镖”。革命史学工作者被挖苦成只会“张开嘴来接受”“烤火鸡”的懒汉。翦伯赞公开反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为研究历史的指导，胡说“以论带史”的口号是“片面的”，“错误的”，“应该废除”。
    实际上，翦伯赞是在反对“教条主义”的幌子下，来推销他的“史料即史学”的私货。他说：“材料是知识的源泉”，“拒绝历史资料就是拒绝历史知识”，等等。他还危言耸听地说，反对“史料即史学”就是把史料和资产阶级一起反，就是无异说“资产阶级是言必有据，无信不征，无产阶级反而是信口开河，随便说话”。
    翦伯赞在这里无非是想说：你们有什么了不起？你们有马列主义作“花边”、“标签”、“保镖”，还是无济于事；还得跟我来，钻进故纸堆，拜倒在古人脚下，靠拾古人的余唾过日子。为了贩卖反马克思主义的史学观点，翦伯赞抬出了司马光这个偶象。曾经说过“不要影射，以古射今或以今射古”的翦伯赞，这时却含沙射影，借用司马光的名字，颂古非今，反对史学革命。
    翦伯赞一方面把革命的史学工作者说成是“懒汉”，把史学战线上蓬蓬勃勃的革命说成是“了草轻率”，一方面则称赞司马光“落笔不苟”的“负责态度”和“严谨精神”，说司马光的精神“对于那些以了草轻率的态度对待编写历史的人是一个最好的教育”。他别有用心地引用元人黄溍的话：“今之文人，类以敏捷为高，贵轻扬而贱持重，使温公复生，未必能与之相追逐也。”翦伯赞卖命地颂扬司马光，就是要“温公复生”，来抗拒史学革命。
    翦伯赞一方面极力诽谤史学革命及其成果是“空洞洞”、“干巴巴”、“单调、僵死、干燥无味”，另方面则对《通鉴》大加赞扬：“叙事则提要钩元，行文则删繁就简，疏而不露，简而扼要。言必有据，没有空话；事皆可征，没有臆说；文字精炼，没有费辞。”一方面把革命史学工作者说得一钱不值，另方面把司马光抬上天，对封建史学颂扬备至。翦伯赞究竟反对什么，赞成什么，恨什么，爱什么，难道还不清楚吗？
    为了取消史学战线上党领导的群众运动，和党的群众路线相抗衡，翦伯赞提出了一条彻头彻尾的资产阶级专家路线。他说，要编写历史就得象司马光那样，“自己邀请”几个“具有专门研究而又是志同道合的朋友”，组成一个“不大”的“集体”，这些人“具备独立处理历史问题的能力”，“能写出基本上具有当时学术水平的初稿”，这些人就是“当时有名的史学家。”换句话说，要编写历史，只能是冷冷清清，由几个“专家”“学者”去搞。让我们看看翦伯赞的主张究竟是些什么货色吧：
    “自己邀请”。就是企图取消党对学术的领导，反对党的领导，就是听任几个“专家”独断独行。这种论调是一点也不新鲜了。早在一九五七年，资产阶级右派分子不是鼓吹过“教授治校”等谬论吗？翦伯赞不过是从垃圾堆中拣来一点破烂罢了。
      “志同道合”。同翦伯赞能合的当然不是马克思主义者，剩下的就只能是一些资产阶级史学家们，才能臭味相投，沆瀣一气。他们的合作结果，必然是反对以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导，共同美化帝王将相，诬蔑农民革命，等等。
      “专门研究”云云。实际上是摆出一副“专家”的“威严”面孔，来吓唬和压制新生力量，压制和排挤年轻的革命的史学工作者。因为在翦伯赞看来，不屑一顾的“懒汉”们是没有资格进入他们所把持的学术“王国”的。
      “当时有名的史学家”，才配得上充当编写历史的成员。这些人必须象司马光所邀请的那样“博记能文章”，“无所不览”，“博通群书”。那么，今天谁能博得翦伯赞这样的尊称呢？还不是邓拓、吴晗、翦伯赞之流资产阶级“权威”。这些“史学家”能编出什么样的历史来？答案不是已经很明显了吗！
    从以上分析可以看出，翦伯赞提出“司马光精神”，完全是为了反对史学革命，反对毛泽东思想，反对党的领导，反对史学工作中的群众运动的。事实上，一九六一年翦伯赞就以司马光自居，邀请了一批“志同道合”的“专家”“学者”，以所谓“司马光精神”，着手编写《中国史纲要》。这部书是资产阶级向我们进攻的一支毒箭，是他们推行和平演变、妄图复辟资本主义的工具。这不是清楚地告诉我们：翦伯赞所吹捧的“司马光精神”，乃是彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的反革命精神。我们必须坚决粉碎它。
