    See the Counter-Revolutionary Face of the "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles" Directors
    —Exposures and Criticisms of the "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles" Directors by Cadres and Soldiers of a Certain PLA Unit Participating in the Film's Production
    *Liberation Army Daily* Editor's Note: The talks by the cadres and soldiers of a certain unit participating in the location shooting of "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles," published in this newspaper today, further expose some of the sinful facts of the directors during the filming process, allowing us to see more clearly the hideous faces of this gang of monsters and demons.
    Look! How hard and rampant they were in praising the defeated Kuomintang reactionary army! How painstaking they were in vilifying our revolutionary soldiers and opposing the people's army! Even a single action, a single prop, a single sound effect, they would never let go of, all infused with their counter-revolutionary thoughts and feelings. Their evil intentions and rampant actions cannot but arouse great indignation among the people!
    We must criticize erroneous things when we see them, eradicate poisonous weeds when we see them, and overthrow monsters and demons when we see them. We must never allow them to run amok and stir up trouble! Chairman Mao said: "Have not the Chinese reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek and others, proved themselves to be a gang of blood-stained, unblinking executioners over the long period of more than twenty years from the counter-revolutionary coup of April 12, 1927, to the present? Have they not proved themselves to be a gang of professional imperialist running dogs and traitors?"
    However, how did the directors of "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles" dress up the Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek when filming the movie?
    They meticulously beautified them from clothing and styling to a simple action. Even as prisoners, they were required to be neatly dressed with sharp creases in their trousers.
    Deputy Company Commander Ding Yongyue said: In September 1963, my comrades and I went to participate in the filming of "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles" with the fervent desire to praise our great Party, our great leader, and our great army. But as soon as filming began, our hearts were half-cooled, and we became more and more angry as we filmed, to the point of bursting our lungs. What angered us the most was that they portrayed a group of watchdogs of the Chiang family dynasty, executioners who slaughtered the people, who had become prisoners, as a bunch of organized, planned, "brave and resourceful," and "sincerely united" fellows. They wore collar badges and cap badges, were neatly dressed, and even used close-up shots to show the creases of their trousers, making them look extremely sharp. We seriously asked the directors at the time: "Why do you have to dress up the enemy in such a majestic manner?" They babbled: "These are all high-ranking Kuomintang officials, so they have to dress better." We were even more furious when we heard this: "Regardless of whether they are high-ranking or low-ranking officials, they are all prisoners, all criminals against the people. Under the blows of our army, they fled east and west in a terrible state, how could they care about what they wear." The directors then said: "The interior scenes have already been filmed, this is filming exterior scenes, if the clothing is changed, it won't connect." After seeing the movie, we realized: Most of the movie is exterior scenes, there are not many interior scenes at all. Their words were completely meant to prevaricate and deceive us.
    They carefully selected actors to play enemy military police, the conditions were: they had to be tall and burly, generally tall.
    Soldier Li Baowu said: The enemy's majestic vigor on the screen was carefully shaped by the directors. That noon, they asked more than ten of us to play enemy military police. The conditions were that we had to be tall and burly, generally tall. After we went, the directors personally selected us one by one, picking out those who were slightly shorter or thinner. Then they instructed us on how to dress, and if anyone's clothes were not the right size, they would immediately change them. Seeing that our unit's newly issued herringbone coats were better than their costumes, they told us to wear our own uniforms. If our helmets were not on straight, they would personally put them on straight, and if they saw that our collar badges were not pinned on well, they would personally pin them on. It was truly "utmost care." We were very disgusted by this "enthusiasm" of the directors, because in our minds, the military police were loyal lackeys of the Kuomintang, all robbers and wolves, and there was no need to be particular about what they wore, let alone pick out different sizes. But the directors' views were completely opposite to ours. So they spent a long time on the issue of clothing. We couldn't help but ask: "What kind of soldiers are you asking us to play as military police, what do they do?" The directors replied: "Don't you understand, the military police are the most powerful soldiers, just like your PLA's military discipline inspectors." We were so angry when we heard this that our throats were on fire. They compared the enemy's military police to our military discipline inspectors, failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, how could this be reasonable! Because we didn't understand the directors' political outlook at the time, nor did we understand the plot of the movie, we had to reluctantly assist in the filming. However, we knew what was what in our hearts, and we resolutely refused to play what we shouldn't play. During the filming, there was such a scene: enemy wounded soldiers搶 [qiang - snatch] the common people's sweet potatoes and cigarettes, and told the military police to beat the wounded soldiers to "maintain discipline." We felt that something was wrong when we heard this, wasn't this trying to portray the Kuomintang as an army that didn't violate even a hair of the people's property? The comrades who played the military police refused to do it. The directors even said nonsense: "The Kuomintang's discipline is also very strict." We refuted him: "The Kuomintang only has the 'discipline' of robbing the people's property, and definitely doesn't have the discipline of safeguarding the people's interests!"
    In order to show the enemy cavalry's majestic advance, one shot took a whole day, and seven warhorses were crippled.
    Squad Leader Zhang Jingtai said: In order to beautify the enemy, the directors spared no effort and expense. One shot of an enemy cavalry company advancing took a whole day. They ran back and forth dozens of times, and seven warhorses were crippled. In order to show the enemy's majesty, they insisted on taking the cavalry to the mountains to film a shot. Because the mountain was steep and the road was narrow, the horses couldn't go up, so they sent more than fifty people to repair the mountain road for two days. In order to have a neat sound of hooves, they made the military horses run again and again, always saying that the sound was not majestic and neat. They carefully directed and carefully observed, and finally discovered that one mule in the horse team was running with a different gait than the group of horses, so they immediately pulled the mule out. At the time, we were very angry, and we all said: "They are the enemy, revolutionary art should vilify them, why do you have to beautify them like this?" We raised our opinions several times, but the directors refused to accept them.
    They wanted the actors playing the enemy to perform the enemy's "majesty" and "wit," and even in long shots, the prisoners had to be neatly dressed.
    Scout Li Chengluo said: When filming enemy cavalry searching a temple, we played the enemy cavalry. The director said to us: "Be majestic, be witty." But at the time, we thought: the enemy has always been a coward in front of our PLA, they should be sneaky, panicked and timid, so we acted according to our own ideas. When the director saw it, he said fiercely: "What kind of look is this, cheer up, the Kuomintang soldiers are not weak, they also pay attention to tactics." We didn't listen to any of these words. After filming several times, they didn't like it and said very dissatisfied: "No, no!" We said: "We don't know how to play Kuomintang soldiers." They even said nonsense, "Search just like you scouts search for the enemy." We want to ask: Why do you want us to play the enemy like revolutionary soldiers? What are your intentions?
    Squad Leader Shi Shiyao said: The directors went to great lengths to beautify every action of the enemy, even the images of characters that were not clear in the movie. When filming, they asked me to play a prisoner. Because it was a minor role, they were all long shots, and it was impossible to see clearly on the screen, but the director still wanted me to wear my clothes neatly, with collar badges and cap badges pinned on properly, and to walk with energy. We said that we had never seen such prisoners! So we pulled off those stinking Kuomintang collar badges and cap badges and pretended to be disheveled and humiliated. The director looked at our expressions and repeatedly said: "Be energetic, be compact!" We didn't listen to that nonsense. After filming several times, it didn't meet their expectations. From our brief contact with the directors, we deeply felt that their spirit of loyalty to the Kuomintang reactionaries was much stronger than that of the Kuomintang reactionary army that was wiped out that year!
    Chairman Mao said: "On the basis of the people's war, on the basis of the unity of the army and the people, the unity of commanders and fighters, and the principle of disintegrating the enemy troops, the People's Liberation Army has established its own strong and powerful revolutionary political work, which is a major factor in our victory over the enemy."
    How did the directors describe our army's political work in the film, and how did they vilify the image of our army's political work cadres?
    They did not show our army's political work at all, and maliciously disguised the actor playing the political instructor with a sad face.
    Platoon Leader Yang Baolai said: The directors wanted me to play a soldier in the detachment, and I followed them to film location scenes for more than a month. I didn't see a portrait of Chairman Mao, I didn't hear a word of Chairman Mao's, I didn't see a political instructor, I didn't see a Communist Party member, I didn't hold a single Party meeting, and I didn't even have any general political and ideological work. Chairman Mao taught us that politics is the commander, is the soul, and political work is the lifeline of our army. But where are the "soul" and "lifeline"? I asked the director: "Do we have a political instructor? Where is he?" The director said coldly: "Yes! The one carrying the box gun is the political instructor!" When we saw the appearance of the political instructor, we discussed it with each other. Some said, this is a deaf man's ear—a decoration. Some said, this is a toy plated with gold, a trick to fool people.
    Deputy Political Instructor Liang Chaoqun said: What is most infuriating is that the directors tried their best to vilify the image of our political instructor. The actor playing the political instructor was originally very strong and burly, but they disguised him as a thin and weak person, wearing a small piece of clothing, always with a big knot on his brow, with a sad face. At the time, we asked: "Why do you have to disguise the political instructor as such an ugly person?" The director replied: "Life was difficult at the time, how could there be such a strong person!" Especially after watching the political instructor's several scenes, everyone was very angry and said that this was not our political instructor. We once sternly pointed out that our political instructor could not be described like this. But the director said: "You are filming location scenes, it will be good to connect the plot." Recently, after watching the movie, it was almost enough to make people angry to death. In front of the prisoners, the political instructor selected the marching route and studied the combat plan, being humble and obedient to the prisoners. This is simply outrageous! How could our People's Liberation Army have such a political instructor? You bunch of guys, you dare to vilify our political instructor so arrogantly and praise the Kuomintang reactionary army, doing so is a great exposure of your reactionary faces.
    Chairman Mao said: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it wants to overwhelm all enemies, and will never be subdued by the enemy."
    During the filming process, the directors sang praises to the enemy, but what attitude did they take towards our great people's army?
    They maliciously wanted the actors playing our army to show fear and anxiety.
    Training Captain Zhai Zhanwu said: In the process of filming, we felt that there was a very strange problem: why are enemy shots always filmed, and our shots are very, very few; why are the enemies always setting traps, and we are falling into traps; why are the enemies always leading us by the nose, and we are following them? We once asked the director why the enemy was always proactive and we were always passive and being suppressed? They said vaguely: "The enemy was strong and we were weak at the time!" These are all deceiving lies.
    Scout Jin Qiwu said: Our army's detachment was丑态百出 [choutai baichu - put on a disgraceful show], completely maliciously fabricated by the directors. When filming the scene of our army's soldiers Ji Pengfei and others hearing the news that the enemy had blocked the road to Shuanglongjiang, there were two opinions at the time: one was the opinion of the masses, including our cadres, soldiers, and some actors, who believed that Ji Pengfei should not be afraid of danger and should calmly respond to the enemy; the other was the opinion of the directors, which was to show fear and anxiety. Everyone argued for a day, and the opinions were not unified. When it came to the actual filming, the debate continued. The directors stubbornly stood on the Kuomintang's position, refused to accept opinions, and maliciously said: "It is possible that the troops produced fear and reluctance to work and demanded to go to the mountains to fight guerrilla warfare because the enemy was chasing from the front and back and the situation was critical." This is simply nonsense. Chairman Mao said: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it wants to overwhelm all enemies, and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult or difficult the occasion, as long as there is one person left, that person will continue to fight." Our army is such an army. Our company has broken through natural dangers, 排万难 [pai wan nan - overcome all difficulties],入虎穴 [ru hu xue - enter the tiger's den],夺虎仔 [duo hu zi - seize the tiger's cub], 打得敌人闻风丧胆 [da de diren wen feng sang dan - frightened the enemy out of their wits],鬼哭狼嚎 [gui ku lang hao - wailing like ghosts and wolves] on the battlefield in the past. Why can't you see such historical facts, and you have to carve out a coward like Ji Pengfei? Isn't this clearly ulterior motives?
    They did not allow the soldiers escorting the prisoners to fix bayonets, but only allowed them to perform in a depressed manner.
    Clerk Xu Heyi said: The directors reversed black and white, and insisted on turning the People's Liberation Army soldiers escorting the prisoners into the enemy's orderlies. I played the soldier escorting the prisoners. At the time, we thought: we are the victorious army, we should be heroic and high-spirited, and we should maintain a high degree of vigilance against the prisoners. Therefore, when filming, I fixed my bayonet, held my gun, and escorted the enemy forward in high spirits. The directors looked at it and said: "This won't work, you have to be lazy and depressed." And they stipulated that we were not allowed to fix bayonets, not allowed to hold guns, only allowed to support guns and shoulder guns. At the time, we resolutely opposed it, and they explained: "After walking a thousand miles, how can there not be scattered people?" We just didn't listen to that nonsense, we had to cheer up, we had to show the attitude of a winner. The directors shouted their voices out and shouted: "Widen the distance, be scattered, the more scattered the better." We did the opposite, and the more we acted, the more energetic we became. The directors saw that their words had no effect, so they came up with a "fatigue tactic" and deliberately pulled us back and forth, running seven or eight times in a row. Finally, they used deceptive means, saying: "Pay attention, filming has begun, filming has begun!" As a result, they didn't shoot. Later they said: "Practice again, next time it will be filmed officially." But the result was that they secretly filmed what everyone didn't practice seriously. In this way, when you look at it on the movie, you can't tell which is the prisoner and which is our soldier. Look, how stubborn is the bourgeois reactionary stance of these guys!
    They specially picked thin and small people to play our army's soldiers; they deliberately let tall people wear small-sized clothes, and small people wear large-sized clothes.
    Deputy Squad Leader Yu Zhanzhou said: "The directors tried every means to vilify us. When playing the soldiers escorting the prisoners, they specially picked thin and small people. The clothes were originally newly made costumes, but they insisted on spraying a layer of ugly gray on them; and they deliberately let tall people wear small-sized clothes, and small people wear large-sized clothes, wearing them on their bodies like a large overcoat, making us look out of shape. We resolutely refused to do it, and they explained: "At that time, the troops were old and small, the old were forty or fifty years old, and the small were ten years old, and the environment was difficult, where would you get suitable clothes." What made me especially angry was that they said that there were no胶鞋 [jiao xie - rubber shoes] in the troops at that time, so they ordered everyone to wear cloth shoes, so I wore a pair of new cloth shoes. The director looked at it and said: "No, it's not realistic, where would you get new cloth shoes at that time." He insisted on making me change to a pair of torn shoes. I said: "I don't have any." So he had a female actor take off a pair of old cloth shoes for me to wear. How could my big feet fit into a female comrade's small shoes? My heels were all exposed. I said: "No, isn't this vilifying our army?" The director said: "It doesn't matter, you can't see clearly, the movie flashes by." I asked back: "Since you can't see clearly and it flashes by, why don't you let me wear new shoes?" The director had nothing to say, and I still put on my new shoes.
    They specially filmed the enemy's "坚强不屈 [jianqiang buqu - unyielding and indomitable]" shots from the front, and did not film our army's soldiers' unparalleled hatred for the enemy from the front.
    Deputy Company Commander Ding Yongyue said: The directors' reactionary class position was very clear. In every shot and every action, he tried every means to beautify the enemy and vilify our army. I filmed such a shot: Our army's detachment was chased by the enemy into a small cave, and the enemy cavalry was at the bottom of the mountain. The prisoners used their feet to kick a stone down the mountain with a哗哗啦啦 [hua hua la la - rushing sound] sound, so that the enemy cavalry would discover us. The director told us to go up and grab the enemy's collar and say: "You troublemaker!" I said that this was too polite and could not express the angry mood of a revolutionary soldier. He insisted on making me act according to their intentions, but according to the situation at the time, I couldn't restrain the anger in my heart no matter what. They said it wasn't good after acting twice, and they repeatedly said: "The mood should be more relaxed, just show anger on your face." When filming, they shot from behind me, so you couldn't see the expression on my face at all. However, the enemy's "坚强不屈 [jianqiang buqu - unyielding and indomitable]" energy was prominently captured. At the time, I was very dissatisfied and sternly pointed out: "Why don't you show the revolutionary soldiers' hatred for the enemy, but instead show the enemy?" The director搪塞 [tangse - prevaricated] and said: "You can see half of your face. The main thing in this shot is to show the enemy's determination not to turn back." Also, when filming the ambush against the enemy cavalry's attack, Zhai Hongge, the squad leader of our company, served as the machine gun shooter. When he saw the enemy coming up, he fired fiercely, and the "enemy" fell down in response. Everyone said it was good after watching it, but the director said "no", saying that "the machine gun fired too fiercely", "too many enemies fell down", and "it was too chaotic". He wasn't satisfied after filming it three or four times. In the last filming, the director wouldn't let him shoot after the machine gun fired a few bullets. Zhai Hongge said: "No, how can the machine gun stop firing at this critical moment?" The director deceived and said: "That's enough, the film won't use it even if you shoot too much." In fact, that's not the case at all, the machine gun shooter on the screen looked like a wooden man, staring at the enemy as they rushed up "majestically".
    Chairman Mao said: Revolutionary art should praise the people and expose the enemy. Directors, what have you praised the people for, and what have you exposed the enemy for? Nothing, not at all. You are maliciously vilifying the people and vilifying the people's army. You are not proletarian artists at all, but thorough bourgeois artists, revisionist artists.
    Chairman Mao said: "The deepest source of the power of war lies in the people," "The soldiers and the people are the foundation of victory."
    Our army relies on the masses of the people, and the people fully support their own soldiers. This is the source of our army's strength to win every battle, overcome every difficulty, overwhelm all enemies, and defeat all enemies. However, these cannot be seen in the film. The directors used all kinds of despicable methods to resist Chairman Mao's thought of people's war.
    They did not film scenes of the people supporting our army, and the only donkey that showed the people's support was also carefully selected, and a thin and small one was chosen.
    Deputy Squad Leader Liu Jinwei said: We followed them to film location scenes for more than a month, and we never saw them filming scenes of the people supporting our army, making our army's detachment appear lonely and without the momentum of a revolutionary army. The more we filmed, the more unreal we felt. When we asked the director, he always hesitated, either saying "there are some in the interior scenes" or not saying anything. Recently, after watching the movie, I realized what kind of medicine they were selling in their "gourd". It turned out that they were engaged in a vicious conspiracy against Chairman Mao's thought of people's war. What they said: "There are some in the interior scenes" is a complete lie. In the film, wherever our army goes, every house is sealed, every window is nailed, there are no people, and it is desolate. Isn't this clearly describing our army as an "isolated army" without the support of the masses and not supported by the masses? So, how did they arrange for the Kuomintang reactionaries? Taking the city, there are gentry and dignitaries to "welcome" them. Entering mountain villages, there are bandits and secret agents to meet them, everywhere there are "masses", and they are very "powerful". Comparing the two, it is clear who the directors are praising, who they are opposing, who they love, and who they hate.
    Squad Leader Xu Ren said: The location scenes of the film were filmed near my hometown, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province. I personally participated in the filming and personally saw the various shameless tricks they used to distort historical facts. The only thing in the film that shows the people's support for the detachment is a small donkey. For this donkey, they carefully selected it, saying that this one was "unqualified" and that one was "unusable". After selecting it over and over again, they chose a donkey that was so thin and small that it would be blown over by the wind and put it on the screen. Why is this? They used the image of a donkey to show that our army was not supported by the masses of the people. This is simply making rumors! In the past, in the years of war, our county, our village, and our family actively supported our own soldiers. The PLA wanted grain, it had grain, it wanted vehicles, it had vehicles, and it wanted people, it had people. When our army fought the Kuomintang Twenty-fifth Division, my father and the villagers personally went to the front line to deliver military food and transport the wounded. It was cold and freezing, and they fought in the wind and snow for dozens of days. Once, they sent a wounded soldier of our army to Kuandian. In order to deliver him in time and ensure treatment, my father drove the road for a day and a night. He said: "At that time, I forgot about being hungry, and I forgot about being tired. I only thought about one thing in my heart: to support our army in winning the battle!" Thinking about the masses' feelings of love and care for our army, and then looking at the movie, you can see through the black hearts of the directors who hate our army, hate the masses of the people, and maliciously distort historical facts at a glance.
    They openly oppressed the masses and disrupted production under the pretext of filming the movie.
    Squad Leader Zhai Hongge said: Speaking of treating the masses of the people, many of the directors' remarks and actions in filming the movie were also very vicious. Once, when filming the detachment marching, they passed through a village. There was clearly a wide road, but they wouldn't let them take it, but instead had people knock down the local people's土墙 [tu qiang - mud walls], pull out a patch of cabbage that was growing inside the walls, and set up the scene to film the movie. The comrades in the troops who participated in the filming all opposed doing this, thinking that they were infringing on the interests of the masses and disrupting production. Who knew that the directors would shamelessly say: "It doesn't matter, we'll pay money, we'll pay as much as we have to!" They even euphemistically said: "This is the need of art." Lies! This is their counter-revolutionary and anti-people need, using the pretext of filming the movie to openly oppress the masses!
    Chairman Mao said: "We cannot love the enemy, we cannot love the ugly phenomena of society. Our goal is to eliminate these things. This is common sense, do our literary and art workers still not understand it?"
    However, the directors of "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles" love the enemy so much and hate our army so much. This is by no means accidental.
    Their positions, viewpoints, thoughts and feelings, and lifestyles are completely the same as those of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    The cadres and soldiers who participated in the filming said: The directors of this movie not only reflected their clear and stubborn reactionary stance in the movie, but also reflected their reactionary thoughts and feelings in their daily lives. They were particularly enthusiastic when talking about the Kuomintang reactionaries. They repeatedly told us how good the Kuomintang reactionary army's equipment was, how high the treatment was, and how capable they were in fighting, speaking with relish. They usually wore Kuomintang clothing and roamed around the city. The people gritted their teeth when they saw it, but they thought they were得意 [deyi - pleased with themselves]. We told them that this had a bad influence, but they ignored it. One day, they wore the performance costumes of Kuomintang officers and entered our dining hall with a "官太太 [guan taitai - officer's wife]" on their arm. It can be seen what these guys are made of in their bones. How much they yearned for the Kuomintang's life, and how much they missed the Kuomintang's clothing! Usually, they always wore "疙瘩帽 [geda mao - bumpy hat]" on their heads, "大小褂 [da xiao gua - large and small jackets]" on their bodies, and carried a提包 [ti bao - handbag] full of apples and糖块 [tang kuai - lumps of candy], swaying and eating wherever they went. They were taking the opportunity to film a movie to live the life of the Kuomintang.
    The Kuomintang's reactionary rule has long been overthrown by us. All the monsters and demons who miss the old China and dream of restoring capitalism, including the directors of "Against the Wind for Thousands of Miles", your fate will not be better than that of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    请看《逆风千里》编导者的反革命嘴脸
    ——参加影片拍摄工作的解放军某部干部战士对《逆风千里》编导者的揭露和批判
    《解放军报》编者按：本报今天发表的参加《逆风千里》外景拍摄工作的某部干部战士的谈话，进一步揭露了编导者在拍摄过程中的一些罪恶事实，使我们更加清楚地看出了这群牛鬼蛇神的狰狞嘴脸。
    请看！他们为了歌颂被打倒了的国民党反动军队，是多么卖力，多么猖狂！为了丑化我们的革命战士、反对人民军队，又是多么煞费苦心！即使是一个动作，一件道具，一声音响，也绝不轻易放过，无不倾注了他们反革命的思想感情。其居心之恶毒，行动之猖獗，不能不引起人们的极大愤慨！
    见到错误的东西就批判，见到毒草就铲除，见到牛鬼蛇神就打倒，我们决不能让它们无法无天、兴风作浪！毛主席说：“以蒋介石等人为首的中国反动派，自一九二七年四月十二日反革命政变至现在的二十多年的漫长岁月中，难道还没有证明他们是一伙满身鲜血的杀人不眨眼的刽子手吗？难道还没有证明他们是一伙职业的帝国主义走狗和卖国贼吗？”
    但是，《逆风千里》的编导者，在拍摄影片时，是怎样打扮以蒋介石为首的中国反动派呢？
    他们从服装、造型到一个简单动作，都精心美化。尽管是俘虏，也要求衣冠整齐，裤线笔直。
    副连长丁永跃说：一九六三年九月间，我和连队的同志们都怀着歌颂我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖、伟大的军队的火热心情，去参加《逆风千里》的拍摄工作。可是一开拍，我们的心就凉了半截，越拍越生气，把肺都要气炸了。我们最气愤的就是把一群当了俘虏的蒋家王朝的看家狗、屠杀人民的刽子手，描绘成一帮有组织、有计划、“有勇有谋”、“精诚团结”的家伙。他们佩戴领章、帽徽，衣冠整齐，甚至连裤线都用特写镜头照出来，显得笔直笔直的。我们当时严肃地向编导者提出：“为什么要把敌人打扮成这个威风凛凛的样子？”他们胡说什么：“这些都是国民党的大官，要穿得好些。”我们一听更火了：“管他什么大官小官的，都是俘虏，都是人民的罪人。他们在我军的打击下，东逃西窜，狼狈不堪，哪里还顾得上什么穿着。”编导者又说：“内景已经拍好了，这是拍外景，如果改变着装就接不上茬了。”等到看了电影我们才清楚了：这个影片大部分是外景，并没有几个内景。他们的话，完全是搪塞和欺骗我们。
    他们精心挑选扮演敌宪兵的演员，条件是：个子要高大魁梧，要一般高。
    战士李宝武说：银幕上敌人那个威风劲，是编导者精心塑造出来的。那天中午，他们叫我们去十多个人扮演敌宪兵。条件是个子要高大魁梧，一般高的。我们去了后，编导者一个个亲自挑选，个子稍矮一点，瘦一点，都挑出来。然后指导我们着装，看谁的衣服大小不合身，立即给换上，看我们部队新发的人字呢衣服比他们的演出服好，就叫我们穿自己的制式服装。看我们钢盔戴得不正，就亲自给戴正，看到我们的领章钉的不好，就亲自给钉上，真是“关怀备至”。我们对编导者的这种“热心”很反感，因为我们心目中的宪兵，就是国民党的忠实走卒，都是强盗恶狼，完全不需要讲究什么穿着，更不需要挑什么大小个。可编导者们和我们的看法却完全相反。所以为了一个着装问题搞了好半天。我们憋不住地问：“你们叫我们扮演的这种宪兵是什么样的兵，干什么的？”编导者回答说：“你们这还不明白，宪兵是最厉害的兵，就象你们解放军的纠察队一样。”我们听了，气得嗓子直冒火。他们把敌人的宪兵比作我们的纠察队，敌我不分，岂有此理！由于当时我们不了解编导者的政治面目，也不了解电影的剧情，只好憋着气协助拍摄。但是，我们心中是有数的，不该演的我们坚决不演。在拍摄中，有这样一个镜头：敌伤兵抢老百姓的地瓜、烟卷，叫宪兵去打伤兵，“维护纪律”。我们一听不对头，这不是要把国民党描写成一支秋毫无犯的军队吗？我们演宪兵的同志不干。编导者竟胡说：“国民党的纪律也是很严明的。”我们驳斥他说：“国民党只有抢劫人民财产的‘纪律’，决没有维护人民利益的纪律！”
    他们为了显示敌骑兵出动的威风，一个镜头竟拍了一天，硬把七匹战马累成残废。
    班长张景泰说：编导者为了美化敌人，不辞辛苦，不惜物力。一个敌骑兵连出动的镜头就拍了一天。反复跑了几十遍，硬是把七匹战马都累成残废。为了显示一下敌人的威风，硬要把骑兵拉到大山上去拍一个镜头。由于山陡路窄，马上不去，竟派五十多人修两天的山路。为了有个整齐的马蹄声，让军马跑了一遍又一遍，老说声音不雄壮，不整齐。他们精心导演，仔细观察，终于发现马队里有一匹骡子跑得步子和那群马的步子不一样，便立即把骡子拉出来。当时我们看了很生气，都说：敌人嘛，革命的文艺就要丑化他们，为什么要这样美化他们呢？我们几次提出意见，而编导者拒不接受。
    他们要扮演敌人的演员演出敌人的“威风”和“机智”，即使拍远镜头，也要俘虏衣冠整齐。
    侦察兵李成洛说：在拍摄敌人骑兵搜索一个庙宇时，我们扮演敌人的骑兵。导演对我们说：“要威风，要机智。”可是我们当时想：敌人在我们解放军面前从来就是胆小鬼，应该是鬼头鬼脑、惊慌胆怯，所以就照着我们自己的想法去演了。导演一看，气势汹汹地说：“你们这象个什么样子，精神点，国民党兵也不熊，他们也讲究战术。”他们这些话，我们半句也听不进去。拍了几次，他们都看不顺眼，很不满意地说：“不行，不行！”我们说：“我们不知道怎样演国民党。”他们竟胡说什么“就象你们侦察兵搜索敌人那样搜索。”我们要问：你们为什么要我们把敌人演成跟革命战士一样呢？你们居心何在？
    班长石世尧说：编导者对于敌人的每个动作，甚至影片上看不清的人物形象，都极力美化。拍摄时，叫我演俘虏，因为是个配角，都是些远镜头，在银幕上根本看不清楚，可是导演还是要我把衣服穿得整整齐齐的，领章、帽徽钉得好好的，走起路来要有精神。我们说，没有见过这样的俘虏！便把国民党那些臭领章，帽徽都给拔了，装成一副丢盔弃甲、丑态百出的样子。导演看着我们神态，反复地讲：“精神点，紧凑点！”我们不听那一套，拍了几遍，没有合他们的意。从我们和编导者的短短接触中，深深感到他们那种效忠国民党反动派的精神，比起当年被消灭的国民党反动军队，还要强得多哩！
    毛主席说：“在人民战争的基础上，在军队和人民团结一致、指挥员和战斗员团结一致以及瓦解敌军等项原则的基础上，人民解放军建立了自己的强有力的革命的政治工作，这是我们战胜敌人的重大因素。”
    在影片中，编导者是怎样描写我军政治工作的呢，又是怎样丑化我军政治工作干部形象的呢？
    他们根本不表现我军的政治工作，把扮演指导员的演员，恶意地化装成一副愁眉苦脸相。
    排长杨宝来说：编导者要我扮演小分队的战士，跟着他们拍摄了一个多月的外景，没有看到一张毛主席的象，没有听到一句毛主席的话，没有见过指导员，没有见过共产党员，没有开过一次党的会议，连一般政治思想工作都没有。毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是我军的生命线。可是“灵魂”和“生命线”在哪里呢？我问导演：“我们有指导员吗？他在哪里？”导演很冷淡地说：“有呀！那个背盒子枪的就是指导员嘛！”我们一看那个指导员的样子，互相就议论开了。有的说，这是聋子的耳朵——摆设。有的说，这是玩具镀金，哄人的把戏。
    副指导员梁超群说：最令人气愤的是编导者百般丑化我们的指导员形象。扮演指导员的演员，身体本来很壮实、魁梧，却给化装成一个瘦小的没有精神的样儿，穿一件小衣服，眉头上总是结着一个大疙瘩，一副愁眉苦脸相。当时我们就问：“为什么要把指导员化装成这么个难看样子呢？”导演回答说：“当时生活艰苦，哪有那么壮实的人！”特别是后来看了指导员的几场戏，大家非常生气，都说这不是我们的指导员。我们曾经严正地指出，不能这样描写我们的指导员。可导演说：“你们拍的是外景，把情节联系起来就好了。”最近一看电影，简直要把人都气死了。指导员当着俘虏的面选定行军路线、研究作战方案，对俘虏低三下四，百依百顺。真是岂有此理！我们人民解放军哪有这样的指导员？你们这帮家伙，竟敢这般狂妄地丑化我们的指导员，歌颂国民党反动军队，这样做是你们反动面目的大暴露。
    毛主席说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”
    在影片的拍摄过程中，编导者对敌人是大唱赞歌，而对我们这支伟大的人民军队，又是采取什么态度呢？
    他们恶毒地要扮演我军的演员，表现害怕、急躁情绪。
    训练队长翟占武说：在拍摄的过程中，我们感到有一个非常奇怪的问题：为什么老是拍敌人的镜头，很少很少拍我们的镜头；老是让敌人设圈套，我们上圈套；老是让敌人牵着我们的鼻子走，我们就跟着走？我们曾经问过导演，敌人为什么处处主动，我们处处被动、挨整呢？他们含糊其词地说：“当时敌强我弱嘛！”这全是骗人的鬼话。
    侦察兵金启武说：我军小分队在银幕上丑态百出，完完全全是编导者恶意编造出来的。在拍摄我军战士纪鹏飞等听到敌人堵住双龙江口前进道路的消息的镜头时，当时有两种意见：一种是群众的意见，包括我们的干部战士和部分演员认为，纪鹏飞应该临危不惧，沉着应战；另一种是编导者的意见，就是要表现出害怕、急躁的情绪。大家争论了一天，意见也没有统一。临到现场拍摄时，还是争论不休。编导者顽固地站在国民党立场上，拒不接受意见，恶毒地说什么：“敌人前堵后追，情况危急，部队产生害怕不愿干的，要求上山打游击的现象是可能的。”这简直是胡说八道。毛主席说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”我们的军队就是这样一支军队。我们连队过去在战场上，破天险，排万难，入虎穴，夺虎仔，打得敌人闻风丧胆，鬼哭狼嚎。你们为什么看不见这样的史实，硬要刻划出纪鹏飞式的胆小鬼呢？这不明明是别有用心吗？
    他们不准押送俘虏的战士上刺刀，只许表演出萎靡不振的样子。
    文书徐贺义说：编导者颠倒黑白，硬要将押送俘虏的人民战士，扮演成敌人的勤务兵。我是扮演押送俘虏的战士。当时我们想：我们是胜利之师，应该雄赳赳气昂昂，对俘虏应该保持高度警惕。所以，拍摄时，我上起刺刀，端着枪，精神抖擞地押着敌人行进。编导者看了说：“这样不行，要懒懒散散、萎靡不振的样子。”并规定我们不许上刺刀，不许端枪，只许托枪和肩枪。当时我们就坚决反对，他们解释说：“走了一千里路，哪还有不稀稀拉拉的呢？”我们偏不听那一套，非振作精神不可，非演出个胜利者的姿态不可。导演们喊破嗓子地嚷嚷：“距离拉大点，稀稀拉拉点，越稀拉越好。”我们就反其言而行之，越演越来劲，越演越有精神。导演们看到他们的话没有奏效，就来了个“疲劳战术”，故意拉着我们来回跑，一连跑了七八趟。最后，又采取了欺骗手段，说：“注意了，开始拍了，拍了！”结果他们却没有拍。后来又说：“再练习一遍，下次正式拍了。”结果却把大家没有认真练习的，偷偷给拍上了。这样在影片上一看，根本分不清哪是俘虏，哪是我们的战士。请看，这些家伙的资产阶级反动立场多么顽固呀！
    他们专挑瘦个子、小个子扮演我军战士；故意让大个子穿小号衣服，小个子穿大号衣服。
    副班长于占洲说：“编导者处处想方设法丑化我们，扮演押送俘虏的战士，他们专挑瘦个子、小个子。衣服本来是新做的演出服，他们硬要给喷上一层难看的灰色；并且故意让大个子穿小号衣服，小个子穿大号衣服，穿到身上象个二大褂子似的，把我们糟蹋得不象样子。我们坚决不干，他们解释说：“那时部队老的老，小的小，老的四五十岁，小的十多岁，环境又艰苦，上哪去弄合身的衣服。”特别使我气愤的是，说当时部队没有胶鞋，叫一律穿布鞋，于是我便穿了一双新布鞋。导演看了说：“不行，不合实际，那时上哪去弄新布鞋。”非叫我换一双破鞋不可。我说：“没有。”他就让一个女演员脱下一双旧布鞋给我穿，我这么大的脚，哪能穿一个女同志的小号鞋呢？脚后跟都露在外边。我说：“不行，这不是丑化我军吗？”导演说：“不要紧，看不清，电影一晃就过去了。”我反问：“既然看不清，一晃就过去了，为什么不让我穿新鞋呢？”导演无话可答了，我还是穿上了我的新鞋。
    他们专从正面拍摄敌人“坚强不屈”的镜头，不从正面拍摄我军战士对敌人的无比仇恨。
    副连长丁永跃说：编导者的反动阶级立场非常鲜明，在每一个镜头，每一个动作上，他都要想方设法地美化敌人，丑化我军。我拍过这样一个镜头：我军小分队被敌追进一个小山洞里，敌人骑兵就在山下，俘虏用脚蹬一块石头哗哗啦啦地往山下滚，好让敌人骑兵发现我们。导演让我们上去抓住敌人的领子说：“你这个捣乱分子！”我说这太和气了，表达不出一个革命战士的愤怒心情。他非让我照着他们的意图演不可，可我根据当时的情景，怎么也克制不了心头怒火，演了两遍，他们都说不行，再三说：“情绪要缓和些，只要脸上表现出愤怒的样子就行了。”拍摄时，他们把镜头从我背后照去，根本看不出脸上的表情。可是敌人那种“坚强不屈”的劲头，倒是突出地摄下来了。当时我非常不满，严肃地指出：“为什么不表现革命战士对敌人的仇恨，反而去表现敌人？”导演搪塞说：“你可以看见半个脸。这个镜头主要是表现敌人死不回头。”还有在拍摄堵击敌人骑兵进攻时，我们连的班长翟洪阁担任机枪射手，他看敌人上来了，就猛烈地射击，“敌人”应声倒下。大家看了都说好，可导演说“不行”，说什么“机枪打得太猛烈了”，“敌人倒下太多了”，“太乱了”，拍了三四次也不满意。最后一次拍摄，机枪刚一响，才打了几发子弹，导演就不让打了。翟洪阁说：“不行，在这紧要关头，机枪怎么能停止射击？”导演欺骗说：“已经够了，拍多了影片也用不上。”其实，哪里是这么一回事，银幕上的机枪射手象个木头人，瞪眼望着敌人“威风凛凛”地往上冲。
    毛主席说过：革命的文艺要歌颂人民，暴露敌人。编导者们，你们哪一点是歌颂了人民，哪一点又是暴露了敌人呢？没有，一点也没有。你们是在恶毒地丑化人民，丑化人民的军队。你们根本不是什么无产阶级的文艺家，而是地地道道的资产阶级的文艺家、修正主义的文艺家。
    毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”，“兵民是胜利之本”。
    我军依靠人民群众，人民全力支援自己的子弟兵，这是我军战无不胜，攻无不克，压倒一切敌人，打败一切敌人的力量源泉。但是，在影片中，却看不到这些。编导者们用一切卑鄙手法，抵制毛主席的人民战争思想。
    他们不拍摄人民群众支援我军的场面，唯一表示人民支援的一头毛驴，也是千挑万选，选中了一头又瘦又小的。
    副班长刘金位说：我们跟他们拍了一个多月外景，一直看不到他们拍摄人民群众支援我军的场面，使我军小分队显得孤孤零零，毫无革命军队的气势。大家越拍，越感到不真实。我们问导演，他总是吞吞吐吐，不是说：“内景里有”，就是不吭声。最近看了影片，才知道他们的“葫芦里”卖的是什么药。原来，他们搞的是一个反对毛主席人民战争思想的毒辣阴谋。他们所说的：“内景里有”，是彻头彻尾的谎言。影片里，我军所到之处，家家封了门，钉了窗，没有人烟，一片凄凉。这不明明是把我军描写成为没有群众支援，不受群众拥护的“孤军”吗？那么，他们对国民党反动派又是怎样安排的呢？占城市，有豪绅、显贵“欢迎”进山村，有土匪、特务接应处处有“群众”，“神通”大得很。两相比较，编导者究竟颂扬谁，反对谁，爱什么人，恨什么人，已经是一清二楚了。
    班长徐仁说：影片的外景，是在我家乡辽宁省凤城县附近拍的。我亲自参加了拍摄，亲自看了他们歪曲历史事实的种种无耻伎俩。影片里唯一表示人民支援小分队的东西就是一头小毛驴。为这条驴，他们千挑万选，这也“不合格”，那也“用不上”，选来选去，选中了一条又瘦又小、风都吹得倒的毛驴，上了镜头。这是为什么？他们是借一条驴的形象，来说明我军不受人民群众支持。这简直是造谣！过去战争的年代，我们县，我们村，我们家，都积极支援过自己的子弟兵，解放军要粮有粮，要车有车，要人有人。咱们军队打国民党二十五师，我父亲和乡亲们，亲自上火线送过军粮，运过伤员，天寒地冻，风里雪里，战斗了几十天。一次，往宽甸送我军一位伤员，为了及时送到，保证治疗，我父亲赶了一天一夜的路。他说：“那时候，饿也忘了，累也忘了，心里只想着一件事：支援咱们军队打胜仗！”想想群众热爱我军、关怀我军的心情，再看看电影，一眼就看穿了编导者仇视我军，仇视人民群众，恶意歪曲历史事实的黑心肠。
    他们借拍影片为名，公开欺压群众，破坏生产。
    班长翟洪阁说：提起对待人民群众，编导者拍摄影片中，许多言论、行动，也是十分恶毒的。一次拍小分队行军，路过一个村庄。明明有宽敞大路，他们不让走，却让人把当地群众的土墙推倒，拔掉墙内正在生长的一片大白菜，拉开架式拍电影。参加拍摄工作的部队同志都反对这样做，认为他们侵犯了群众利益，破坏了生产。谁料，编导者竟恬不知耻地说：“不要紧，我们给钱，要赔多少赔多少！”还美其名说：“这是艺术需要。”鬼话！这是他们反革命反人民的需要，是借拍影片为名，公开欺压群众！
    毛主席说：“我们不能爱敌人，不能爱社会的丑恶现象，我们的目的是消灭这些东西。这是人们的常识，难道我们的文艺工作者还有不懂得的么？”
    可是《逆风千里》的编导者，对敌人是那样的爱，对我们军队是那样的恨，这决不是偶然的。
    他们的立场、观点、思想感情、生活作风，完全是国民党反动派那一套。
    参加拍摄的干部战士们说：这个影片的编导者，不仅在影片中反映出他们那鲜明、顽固的反动派的立场，而且在日常生活中也反映了他们那种反动的思想感情。他们一讲起国民党反动派那一套来，就特别的起劲。多次给我们讲国民党反动军队装备如何好，待遇如何高，打仗如何能耐，讲得津津有味。他们平时穿着国民党的服装，在城市里到处逛。老百姓看了直咬牙，他们却自以为得意。我们向他们提出，这样影响不好，可是他们置之不理。有一天，他们穿着国民党军官的演出服装，手挽着个“官太太”，闯进了我们的饭堂。可见这帮家伙的骨子里到底是些什么东西。他们是多么向往国民党的生活，多么留恋国民党的穿着！平时他们总是头上戴着“疙瘩帽”，身上穿着“大小褂”，手上挎个提包，装满苹果、糖块，摇摇摆摆，走到哪里吃到哪里。他们是以拍摄电影为名，大过国民党生活之瘾。
    国民党的反动统治，早已被我们推翻了。怀恋旧中国，梦想复辟资本主义的一切牛鬼蛇神，包括《逆风千里》的编导者，你们的下场也决不会比国民党反动派更好一些。
