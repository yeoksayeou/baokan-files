	It should be made clear to every comrade that the words and actions of a Communist must be judged by whether they conform to the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people and are supported by them. This is the highest standard.

	Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Shanghai, the city with the highest concentration of industrial workers in our country, has seen over 20,000 outstanding workers from the industrial system join the Communist Party of China in the past year.

	Mao Zedong's works have become the best textbooks for new party members. They study Mao Zedong's works seriously, understand them deeply, and apply them actively. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they charge into battle without fear.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 29th — Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, Shanghai, the city with the highest concentration of industrial workers in our country, has seen over 20,000 outstanding workers from the industrial system join the Communist Party of China in the past year.

	Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the party organizations at various levels in Shanghai's industrial departments have strictly followed Chairman Mao's instructions on party-building work. In the past year, the majority of the new party members developed are workers on the front lines of production. Some production teams that originally had no party members now have party members, many of whom are young workers and women workers. With the help of the party organizations and old party members, these new party members continuously improve their class consciousness and party spirit, playing a model leading role in their respective positions, becoming a bridge for the party to connect with the masses, and further strengthening the combat effectiveness of the factory party organizations.

	Some new party members from various factories recently shared their growth process with reporters, expressing their excitement and emotion. They pointed out that as advanced and revolutionary members of the working class, they originally had a natural connection with the party, holding the deepest affection for the party and the most sincere love for Chairman Mao. However, it was only after they were continuously nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought and armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought that their class consciousness underwent a qualitative leap, becoming conscious fighters for the cause of communism. Their growth process is a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Last year, factories and enterprises in Shanghai launched a mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works on the basis of the socialist education movement. The majority of workers studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On Practice." Some even studied Chairman Mao's four philosophical works, including "On Contradiction." These new party members emerged as active elements in the wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They studied Chairman Mao's works most seriously, understood them most deeply, and applied them most actively. Chairman Mao's works became their best textbooks for party lessons. From Chairman Mao's works, they obtained the great spiritual power to transform their worldview and the objective world, further raising their ideological awareness and gradually clarifying the most fundamental issue for a revolutionary: to struggle for the cause of communism all one's life. Jiang Shichuan, a new party member from Shanghai Radio Factory, suffered immense exploitation and oppression before liberation. After liberation, his family's life improved year by year. Jiang Shichuan, with a heart full of gratitude to the party, worked diligently. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," he compared his thoughts and work over the years, realizing that production is for the Chinese revolution and the people of the world who are still not liberated. He should contribute everything for the great ideal of realizing communism worldwide. Thus, his revolutionary horizon broadened, and he felt that his work had new significance. His production became more energetic, especially showing concern for domestic and international revolutionary affairs and the work of the team. He continuously influenced and promoted the progress of his comrades around him with his exemplary actions.

	The party organizations at various levels in the factories continuously help these new party members arm themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings on the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society. They consciously put them in the midst of fierce class struggles to experience hardships and gain experience. These new party members showed firm stances and keen political instincts in the struggles, firmly holding high the banner of eliminating the bourgeoisie and promoting the proletariat. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the first severe test they face after joining the party. They charge into battle without fear in the struggle. In some factories or workshops, the first big-character poster exposing anti-party and anti-socialist elements was posted by new party members.

	Shen Bocheng, the deputy leader of the famous Red Thunder Youth Group and a new party member, is a young technician of worker origin. In 1962, when he was transferred to the Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Experimental Factory, he was determined to temper himself into a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause. But at that time, a bourgeois "authority" specially had a whole day's talk with him, advocating that he should focus on his business, walk the path of personal struggle of the bourgeoisie, and "cultivate" himself into a bourgeois "expert." When Shen Bocheng was confused, the party branch secretary moved in to live with him, often had heart-to-heart talks with him, pointing out that the bourgeois "authority" wanted him to walk a dangerous path. At this time, Shen Bocheng, linking his thoughts with reality, repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" again, his mind suddenly became clear, deeply realizing that the bourgeois "authority's" persuasion to him was actually an attempt to drag him into the bourgeoisie's quagmire; he must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to be a person like Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. From then on, he studied Chairman Mao's works more seriously, and his ideological awareness continuously improved. He and other members of the group, despising the various cold mockery and jeers of the bourgeois "authority" and "expert," bravely took on the heavy responsibility of researching and developing a new type of synthetic fiber under very difficult conditions, after 1,050 experiments, finally succeeded.

	Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, these new party members, through the tempering of the three great revolutionary movements, not only greatly improved their ideological awareness and further solidified their class stance, but also many of them had a relatively deep understanding of Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts. Therefore, they dared to struggle and were good at struggling, and their contributions in the field of production became greater and greater. Some people, in the process of technological innovation, used the philosophical views of Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," saw the factors of success in failure, enhanced their confidence to overcome difficulties, continuously accumulated experience from practice, conducted specific analysis of complex phenomena, grasped the key points, and thus successfully solved difficult problems. Fang Zhongliang, a new party member and steelworker from Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, used Chairman Mao's dialectical views to carefully explore the laws of steelmaking, resulting in the use of old and outdated converters to smelt some high-grade steel types that originally needed to be smelted in open-hearth furnaces, with a qualification rate of over 99%.

	In the process of growing from an ordinary worker into a conscious communist fighter, these new party members deeply felt the greatness and brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They loved Chairman Mao even more and loved to read Chairman Mao's books even more. They expressed their determination to always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, do revolution for a lifetime, and let the red flag of revolution forever fly high on the land of China.

    应该使每个同志明了，共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准
    毛泽东思想哺育我们成为无产阶级先锋战士
    上海产业系统一年来两万多名优秀职工光荣入党
    毛主席著作成了新党员的最好的党课教材。他们对毛主席著作，学习认真，理解深刻，用得很活。在这次文化大革命中，他们冲锋陷阵，无所畏惧
    新华社上海二十九日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，我国产业工人最集中的城市上海，最近一年来又有两万多名产业系统的优秀职工光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    在中共上海市委的领导下，上海工业部门的各级党组织，在建党过程中严格遵循了毛主席有关建党工作的指示，一年来发展的新党员，绝大部分都是战斗在生产第一线的工人。有些原来没有党员的生产小组，现在已发展了党员，其中不少是青年工人和女工。这些新党员在党组织和老党员的帮助下，不断提高自己的阶级觉悟和党性修养，在各个岗位上发挥了模范带头作用，成为党联系群众的桥梁，工厂党组织的战斗力得到了进一步的加强。
    一些工厂的新党员最近向记者介绍他们的成长过程时，心情十分兴奋和激动。他们指出，自己作为先进的、革命的工人阶级的一员，原来和党就有天然的联系，对党有着最深厚的感情，对毛主席怀着最真挚的热爱。但是，只有在他们不断受到伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，用毛泽东思想武装自己以后，阶级觉悟才发生了质的飞跃，成为一个自觉地为共产主义事业奋斗的无产阶级先锋战士。他们的成长过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己的过程。
    上海的工厂企业去年在开展社会主义教育运动的基础上，掀起了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的新热潮，广大职工普遍地学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，有部分人还进而学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》等四篇哲学著作。这些新党员就是在活学活用毛主席著作热潮中涌现出来的积极分子。他们对毛主席的著作，学习最认真、理解最深刻、用得最活。毛主席著作成了他们最好的党课教材。他们从毛主席著作中得到了改造自己世界观的和改造客观世界的伟大精神力量，思想觉悟有了进一步的提高，逐渐明确一个革命者最根本的问题，是为共产主义事业奋斗一生。上海无线电二厂新入党的冲床工蒋仕传，解放前受尽了剥削和压迫，解放后，他一家人的生活越过越好。蒋仕传怀着对党报恩的心情，勤勤恳恳地生产。他反复学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章后，对比了自己这些年的思想和工作，觉悟到生产是为了中国革命和世界上三分之二还没有解放的人民，自己应当为了在全世界实现共产主义的伟大理想而贡献出一切。这样，他的革命胸怀宽阔了，感到自己的工作有了崭新的意义，生产越来越有劲，特别是变得关心国内外的革命大事，关心小组的工作，不断以自己的模范行动，去影响、推动周围的同志进步。
    工厂的各级党组织，不断帮助这些新入党的工人用毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说来武装自己，并且有意识地把他们放到激烈的阶级斗争中去经风雨、见世面。这些新党员在斗争中表现得立场坚定，政治嗅觉敏锐，以极大的革命热情坚持兴无灭资斗争。当前正在蓬勃开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是他们入党后经受的第一个严峻考验。他们在斗争中冲锋陷阵，无所畏惧。有些工厂或车间揭发反党反社会主义分子的第一张大字报，就是由新党员贴出来的。
    上海著名的红雷青年小组的副组长、新入党的沈伯成，是一个工人出身的青年技术员。他一九六二年调到当时的上海合成纤维实验工厂时，立志要把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。但就在那时，有一个资产阶级“权威”，特地同他长谈了一整天，鼓动他埋头钻业务，走资产阶级的个人奋斗的道路，把自己“造就”成一个资产阶级“专家”。正当沈伯成迷惑不解的时候，党支部书记搬去和他住在一起，经常和他谈心，指出资产阶级“权威”要他走的是一条危险的道路。这时沈伯成联系自己的思想实际，重新反复学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》两篇文章，思想豁然开朗，深切地认识到那个资产阶级“权威”对自己的劝诱，实质上是企图把自己拉到资产阶级的泥坑里；自己一定要按毛主席的教导，作张思德、白求恩那样的高尚的人。从此，他更加认真学习毛主席著作，思想觉悟不断提高。他和小组的其他同志一起，蔑视资产阶级“权威”“专家”的种种冷嘲热讽，在很困难的条件下，勇敢地挑起研究试制一种新型合成纤维的重担，经过一千零五十次的试验，终于获得了成功。
    在毛泽东思想的哺育下，这些新入党的工人通过三大革命运动的锻炼，不仅大大提高了思想觉悟，进一步坚定了阶级立场，而且许多人对毛主席的哲学思想有了比较深刻的理解，因此他们敢于斗争、善于斗争，在生产领域里所作出的贡献越来越大。有些人在技术革新中，运用毛主席《矛盾论》《实践论》的哲学观点，在失败的时候看到成功的因素，增强了克服困难的信心，不断从实践中积累经验，对复杂的现象进行具体分析，抓住关键所在，从而顺利地解决了难题。上海第一钢铁厂新入党的炼钢工人房忠良，运用毛主席的辩证观点，精心探索炼钢规律，结果用又老又旧的转炉，炼出了原来需要用平炉冶炼的一些高级钢种，合格率达到百分之九十九以上。
    这些新党员在从一个普通工人成长为自觉的共产主义战士的经历中，深切地感受到毛泽东思想的无比伟大，无比光辉。他们更加热爱毛主席，更加爱读毛主席的书。他们表示一定要永远牢记毛主席的教导，读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，让革命的红旗在中国的土地上永远高高飘扬。
