Warm Congratulations to the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers

Premier Zhou Enlai's Telegram of Congratulations

New China News Agency, June 27th: The full text of the telegram of congratulations from Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers is as follows:

Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers:

On the occasion of the solemn opening of the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers, I, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and in my personal capacity, extend warm congratulations to the conference. I wish this conference great success in supporting and aiding the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, opposing imperialism and neocolonialism led by the United States, and developing the national cultures of Asian and African countries.

At present, the international situation is excellent. The entire world situation is in a state of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization, which is the inevitable result of the deepening of people's revolutionary struggles. People around the world are further uniting to form the broadest and most genuine international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices. A new anti-American revolutionary storm is about to sweep across the globe.

The Soviet modern revisionists have consistently sabotaged the anti-imperialist revolutionary movements of the Asian and African peoples and consistently sabotaged the Asian and African Writers' Conferences. This time, the split conference they orchestrated once again proves that the Soviet leadership is an accomplice of American imperialism and a betrayer of the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples and the Vietnamese people. This conference, attended by representatives from more than forty countries and regions, held in Beijing, is an unprecedentedly grand gathering of the Asian and African organizations. It once again demonstrates the strength of the Asian and African peoples in uniting against imperialism, showing that any attempts by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces of various countries to sabotage Asian and African unity are in vain. This conference marks a completely new stage in the Asian and African writers' movement. This conference will not only powerfully promote the development of the Asian and African writers' movement but will also have a profound impact on the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

Today, the Chinese people are in the midst of a high tide of a cultural revolution. At this time, the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers is being held in Beijing. We sincerely welcome the delegates to visit various parts of our country after the conference.

Heartfelt wishes for the success of the conference!

Prince Norodom Sihanouk's Letter of Congratulations

New China News Agency, June 27th: The full text of the letter of congratulations from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Head of State of the Kingdom of Cambodia, to the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers is as follows:

Dear Friends:

I am very pleased to extend my warmest congratulations to all Asian and African writers gathered in Beijing to discuss their common problems and wish your conference every success.

Asian and African writers, whether they are novelists or poets, philosophers or historians, or even journalists, play an important role and have a great responsibility. Promoting the social, economic, and cultural development of their countries, effectively supporting the struggle against imperialist aggression, and striving to strengthen unity and the resolve of the people, these are difficult but inspiring tasks.

Therefore, I sincerely wish that this Beijing conference will contribute to strengthening support for the peoples of Indochina, especially the Vietnamese people, who are suffering from American aggression. Finally, I wish that the truly anti-imperialist Asian and African writers will find the words and tones that help to rebuild and strengthen Asian and African unity.

Norodom Sihanouk

Prince Souphanouvong's Telegram of Congratulations

New China News Agency, June 27th: The full text of the telegram of congratulations from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, to the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers is as follows:

Beijing, Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers:

I, on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Lao people, and myself, extend my respect and sincere greetings to this conference and all the delegates.

This conference is held at a time when the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are achieving victories in their struggle against American imperialism. American imperialism is frantically interfering with and invading many countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, and the Congo, further exacerbating the already tense situation. This conference demonstrates the growing strength of the unity of Asian and African writers. This conference concentrates on the rich and combative essence of Asian and African people's literature and will open a new chapter in the literary history of the Asian and African peoples and progressive humanity.

As a sacred task of writers, this conference will spare no effort to contribute to the struggle against American imperialism—the most vicious enemy of humanity. American imperialism is trampling on the national cultures of the three continents and suppressing the surging national liberation movements.

As a fighter on the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism, the Lao people highly value the great power of literature, that is, the cultural front in the cause of national liberation. The delegation of the Lao Cultural Association, participating in the conference, will do its utmost to help the conference succeed. We are firmly convinced that the achievements of the conference will be a great encouragement to the Lao people's struggle against American imperialism and for national salvation, as well as to other patriotic movements.

Finally, I sincerely wish the conference a brilliant success in an atmosphere of close unity and resolute struggle.

Kwame Nkrumah's Telegram of Congratulations

New China News Agency, June 27th: The full text of the telegram of congratulations from Kwame Nkrumah to the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers is as follows:

Chairman of the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers in Beijing:

Please accept my congratulations on the great achievements of the recently concluded Standing Committee of the Asian and African Writers. This achievement shows Asian and African unity, which is achieved at a time when people around the world who love freedom and peace urgently need to unite. Because this is the time when imperialism, colonialism, and reactionary forces, as well as all similar oppressive forces, are adopting new neocolonialist methods. This is also the time when we must make every effort to support and consolidate the unity of all those who oppose not only political and economic imperialism but also cultural imperialism. I am deeply convinced that in the near future, the joint efforts of all freedom fighters and peace-loving people around the world will achieve victory in the struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, racism, and the oppressive forces of reactionaries. I wish the upcoming Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers even greater success.

    热烈祝贺亚非作家紧急会议
    周恩来总理的贺电
    新华社二十七日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来致亚非作家紧急会议的贺电，全文如下：亚非作家紧急会议：
    当亚非作家紧急会议隆重开幕之际，我谨代表中国人民、中国政府和以我个人的名义，向大会致以热烈的祝贺，预祝这次会议在支持和声援越南人民的抗美救国斗争、反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义和发展亚非各国的民族文化方面，作出新的贡献。
    目前，国际形势大好，整个世界局势正处于大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程中，这是人民革命斗争深入发展的必然结果。全世界人民正在进一步团结起来，结成最广泛、最真实的反对美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶的国际统一战线，一个新的反美革命风暴即将在全世界范围内兴起。
    苏联现代修正主义者一贯破坏亚非人民的反帝革命运动，一贯破坏亚非作家会议。这次他们一手制造的分裂会议又一次证明，苏联领导集团是美帝国主义的帮凶，是亚非人民和越南人民革命事业的背叛者。这次有四十多个国家和地区的代表参加的在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，是亚非组织空前盛大的集会，再一次显示了亚非人民团结反帝的力量，说明了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的任何破坏亚非团结的活动，都是徒劳的。这次会议标志着：亚非作家运动进入了一个完全新的阶段。这次会议，不仅会有力地推动亚非作家运动的发展，而且会对亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争产生深远的影响。
    今天，中国人民正投身于一个社会主义文化大革命的高潮之中。值此时期，亚非作家紧急会议在北京召开，我们诚挚地欢迎与会的朋友们会后到我国各地去参观访问。
    衷心祝愿会议胜利成功！
              中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来

    西哈努克亲王的贺信
    新华社二十七日讯　柬埔寨王国国家元首诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王致亚非作家紧急会议的贺信，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    我十分高兴地向聚会在北京，研究他们共同问题的全体亚非作家致以最热烈的祝贺，并祝他们的会议圆满成功。
    亚非作家，不论是小说家或诗人，哲学家或历史学家，或者甚至是新闻记者，都起着重要的作用，有着重大的责任。促进国家的社会、经济和文化的发展，有效地支持反对帝国主义侵略的斗争，为加强团结和人民的决心而努力，这些都是困难、但又激动人心的任务。
    因此，我谨祝愿这次北京会议能够为增强对遭受美国罪恶侵略的印度支那人民，特别是越南人民的支援作出贡献。最后，我祝愿真正反帝的亚非作家找到有助于重建并加强亚非团结的词句和语调。
                                诺罗敦·西哈努克

    苏发努冯亲王的贺电
    新华社二十七日讯　老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王致亚非作家紧急会议的贺电，全文如下：北京，亚非作家紧急会议：
    我谨以老挝爱国战线党、老挝人民以及我个人的名义，向这次会议和与会的全体代表表示我的敬意和诚挚的问候。
    这次会议是在这样的时刻召开的：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在反对美帝国主义的斗争中取得胜利，美帝国主义正在疯狂地对越南、老挝、印度尼西亚和刚果等许多国家进行干涉和侵略，从而使已经紧张的局势进一步恶化。这次会议显示了日益增强的亚非作家团结的巨大力量。这次会议集中地体现了亚非人民文学的丰富和有战斗性的精华，并将在亚非人民和进步人类的文学史上揭开新的一页。
    作为作家的一个神圣任务，这次会议将竭尽全力，来对反对美帝国主义——人类最凶恶的敌人——的斗争作出贡献。美帝国主义正在蹂躏三大洲各国的民族文化和镇压风起云涌的民族解放运动。
    作为战斗在反对美帝国主义的斗争的最前线的一员，老挝人民非常重视文学的巨大力量，也就是说非常重视民族解放事业中的文化阵线。老挝文化协会代表团前来参加会议，将尽自己的一切力量帮助会议取得成功。我们坚信，会议的成就，对于老挝人民反对美帝国主义和救国的斗争以及其他爱国运动，将是巨大的鼓舞。
    最后，我衷心祝愿会议在洋溢着紧密团结和坚决斗争的气氛中取得光辉的成就。
  老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席　老挝三方民族团结政府副首相　苏发努冯亲王

    克瓦米·恩克鲁玛的贺电
    新华社二十七日讯　克瓦米·恩克鲁玛致亚非作家紧急会议的贺电，全文如下：北京亚非作家紧急会议主席：
    请接受我对刚刚结束的亚非作家常设局会议所取得的巨大成就的祝贺。这个成就表明了亚非团结，它是在世界各地爱好自由和平的全体人民极需团结起来的时候取得的。因为这个时刻正是帝国主义、殖民主义和反动势力以及一切类似的压迫势力采取新殖民主义新方式的时刻。这也是必须尽一切努力来支持和巩固所有不仅反对政治和经济帝国主义，而且也反对文化帝国主义的人们的团结的时刻。我深信，在不久的将来，所有自由战士和全世界爱好和平人民的共同努力，将在反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义、种族主义以及反动派的压迫势力的斗争中取得胜利，祝即将召开的亚非作家紧急会议获得更加辉煌的成功。
