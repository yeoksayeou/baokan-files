    Chemical Fertilizer Industry Front: Red Flags Fluttering
    From January to May, our country's chemical fertilizer industry front has achieved a series of new victories in production. These victories are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. These victories once again demonstrate with eloquent facts: that when Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it can generate enormous material strength.
    Chairman Mao teaches us: Marxism-Leninism must develop in struggle. Correct things always develop in the process of struggling against incorrect things. The achievements made by the chemical fertilizer industry front in production have come precisely from the great debate on giving prominence to politics. The vast number of workers and staff on the chemical fertilizer industry front, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticized erroneous ideas and confused concepts such as "politics is a soft task, production is a hard task"; "factories are for production, production is everything, everything obeys production, everything serves production"; and "politics and business take turns being prominent." Through great debate, they clarified their understanding of giving prominence to politics and first implemented giving prominence to politics in the ideological revolutionization of people. This laid a solid ideological foundation for doing all work well. They launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's writings; they strived to transform their world outlook, establishing the revolutionary thought of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world; they not only clarified that enterprises must be run according to Mao Zedong Thought but also applied Mao Zedong Thought to practice, solving specific problems in the increase production and practice economy movement.
    The great debate on giving prominence to politics is an intense struggle between correct and incorrect ideas, a sharp class struggle between giving prominence to proletarian politics and giving prominence to bourgeois politics. Giving prominence to proletarian politics and arming the minds of the vast number of workers and staff with Mao Zedong Thought has revolutionized people's thinking. Production on the chemical fertilizer industry front has leaped forward, and many problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past have been solved. Advanced enterprises have become even more advanced, and enterprises with relatively poor production in the past have also caught up. The chemical fertilizer industry presents a thriving atmosphere, powerfully supporting agricultural production.
    Of course, giving prominence to politics cannot be completely resolved through one debate or a period of effort. New situations, new conditions, and new contradictions may impact giving prominence to politics. The workers and staff on all our industrial fronts must resolutely give prominence to politics, strive to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, actively participate in the great proletarian cultural revolution, criticize the bourgeoisie, and promote the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, learning from each other and helping each other with the revolutionary spirit of communism. In this way, our industrial production upsurge will definitely be able to develop sustainably and healthily.

    化肥工业战线上红旗飘扬
    我国化肥工业战线上，从一月到五月，在生产上取得了一系列的新胜利。这些胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。这些胜利，又一次以雄辩的事实表明了：毛泽东思想被群众掌握了，能够产生出多么巨大的物质力量。
    毛主席教导我们：马克思列宁主义必须在斗争中才能发展。正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。化肥工业战线在生产上取得的成绩，正是从突出政治的大辩论中得来的。化肥工业战线的广大职工，用毛泽东思想作为武器，批判了“政治是软任务，生产是硬任务”；
  “工厂是搞生产的，生产就是一切，一切服从于生产，一切服务于生产”；“政治与业务轮流突出”等等错误思想和糊涂观念，通过大辩论，明确了对突出政治的认识，把突出政治首先落实到人的思想革命化上。这就为做好一切工作，打下了牢固的思想基础。他们掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮；他们努力改造自己的世界观，树立起为中国人民和世界人民服务的革命思想；他们不但明确了必须按照毛泽东思想办企业，并且运用毛泽东思想到实际中去，解决增产节约运动中的具体问题。
    突出政治的大辩论，就是正确思想同错误思想的一场激烈斗争，突出无产阶级政治还是突出资产阶级政治的一场尖锐的阶级斗争。突出了无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想武装了广大职工的头脑，人的思想革命化了，化肥工业战线上生产就突飞猛进，许多过去长期解决不了的问题解决了。先进的企业更先进了，原来生产较差的企业也赶上来了。化肥工业就呈现出一片兴旺气象，有力地支援了农业生产。
    当然，突出政治，不是经过一次辩论，一个时期的努力，就能够完全解决的。新的情况，新的条件，新的矛盾，都可能冲击突出政治。我们各个工业战线上的职工们，必须坚决突出政治，努力活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加伟大的无产阶级文化革命，批判资产阶级，发扬无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，以共产主义的革命精神，互相学习，互相帮助。这样，我们的工业生产高潮一定能够持续地、健康地发展下去。
