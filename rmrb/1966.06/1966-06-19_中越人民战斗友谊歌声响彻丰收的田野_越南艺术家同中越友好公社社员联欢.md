    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. Led by Su Hai, head of the Circus Troupe of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Vietnamese artists visited the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune in Shahe, Changping County, Beijing, this morning. They joined the commune members in a joyful celebration in the fields and participated in wheat harvesting. The sound of the Sino-Vietnamese people's fighting friendship echoed throughout the bountiful fields.
    The Vietnamese comrades arrived at the Fourth Production Team of the commune just as the members and officers and soldiers of a certain air force unit stationed in Beijing were harvesting wheat. The circus troupe members were warmly welcomed by Guo Zhaoxiang and Ma Chenzhen, deputy directors of the commune, as well as the commune members and the officers and soldiers. As soon as the performers put down their props, they picked up sickles and joined everyone in harvesting wheat. The sun was scorching hot, and the performers were covered in sweat during the labor. Jin Ying, a female performer, excitedly told reporters that participating in today's labor was the happiest thing for her. She mentioned that the circus troupe often performed for the Vietnamese People's Army in the past, and sometimes even directly participated in combat. On September 26th of last year, they were performing for the Vietnamese People's Army at an artillery position in Thanh Hóa Province. When enemy planes invaded, they helped transport shells for the troops, and with their cooperation, the artillery shot down the F-105 aircraft that the U.S. imperialists boasted about. Li Jinzhu, the female captain of the production team, told the Vietnamese comrades that in order to support the Vietnamese people in driving out U.S. imperialism as soon as possible, they would put in more effort in production, which would add more strength. She excitedly said that although they encountered drought again this year, under the leadership of the Party, everyone had great enthusiasm and confidence, and finally overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest, with the team's yield reaching 500 jin per mu.
    To commemorate this meaningful day of labor, the guests and hosts proposed naming this day "Anti-U.S. Labor Day."
    During the break, the Vietnamese artists and the commune members held a joint celebration in the fields. Primary school students from the commune performed the "The Radiance of Chairman Mao" dance, and An Fenglin, a five-good soldier from the air force unit stationed in Beijing, sang songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." In addition to performing wonderful acrobatic acts, Vietnamese artists such as female performer Qing Lü also sang songs such as "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Farm Village" and "Commune Members Are All Sunflowers."
    Guo Zhaoxiang, the deputy director of the commune, spoke at the celebration, saying that as long as U.S. imperialism exists for one day, our struggle cannot be relaxed for even a minute. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are determined to support the Vietnamese people and drive U.S. imperialism out of Vietnam as soon as possible with practical actions of striving for production and stepping up military training.
    In his speech, Head Su Hai, on behalf of the Vietnamese people and all members of the Việt-Trung People's Friendship Cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi, extended cordial greetings to the Chinese people and all members of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune. He said that U.S. imperialism looks very ferocious, destroying the fields and construction of Vietnam. But U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. Over the years, they have not achieved any results, but have increased the Vietnamese people's hatred of the enemy and fighting power, and production has risen even more. At the celebration, he presented to the commune members fragments of the American Thunder-type aircraft shot down in Thái Nguyên Province on April 29 this year, which were also fragments of the 1,000th aircraft shot down by the Vietnamese people, as well as related albums.
    The celebration was filled with an atmosphere of fighting friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people from beginning to end, and the comrades of the two countries sang songs such as "Unity is Strength." The Vietnamese artists also visited the commune's duck farm and pig farm today. Guo Zhaoxiang introduced the commune's production situation to the guests.

    中越人民战斗友谊歌声响彻丰收的田野
    越南艺术家同中越友好公社社员联欢
    新华社十八日讯　越南民主共和国杂技团团长苏海率领越南艺术家们，今天上午来到北京市昌平县沙河中越友好人民公社参观访问，和社员们在田间联欢，并一起割麦。丰收的田野上，传出了中越人民战斗友谊的歌声。
    越南同志来到公社第四生产队，正赶上社员和人民解放军驻京空军某部的官兵一起在收割小麦。杂技团演员们受到了公社副主任郭兆祥、马陈祯和社员以及部队官兵的热烈欢迎。演员们一放下道具，马上拿起镰刀和大家一起收割小麦。这时烈日当头，演员们在劳动中汗流浃背。女演员金英激动地对记者说：能参加今天的劳动，是她最高兴的事情。她谈到杂技团过去经常到战地给越南人民军演出，有时还直接参加战斗。去年九月二十六日，他们在清化省一处炮兵阵地上给越南人民军演出。敌机入侵时，就给部队运送炮弹，在他们的配合下，炮兵打下了美帝吹嘘的F—105飞机。生产队女队长李金珠对越南同志说：为了支援越南人民早日赶走美帝国主义，她们在生产上多流一把汗，就是多增加一分力量。她兴奋地说，虽然这里今年又遇到干旱，在党的领导下，大家干劲大，信心足，终于战胜了干旱，夺得了丰收，全队每亩产量达到五百斤。
    为了纪念今天这个有意义的劳动，宾主提议把这一天命名为“抗美劳动日”。
    在休息的时刻，越南艺术家同社员们一起在田野里举行了联欢会。公社小学生在这里演出了“毛主席的光辉”舞蹈，驻京空军部队五好战士安凤林演唱了《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。越南艺术家们除表演了精采的杂技节目外，女演员清滤等还演唱了《毛主席来到咱农庄》、《社员都是向阳花》等歌曲。
    公社副主任郭兆祥在联欢会上讲话，他说，只要美帝国主义存在一天，我们的斗争连一分钟也不能放松。我们在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，决心以努力生产，加紧练兵的实际行动，支援越南人民，把美帝国主义早日赶出越南去。
    苏海团长在讲话中代表越南人民和河内郊区越中人民友好合作社全体社员，向中国人民和中越友好人民公社全体社员致以亲切问候。他说，美帝国主义看样子很凶恶，破坏了越南的农田和建设。但美帝国主义是纸老虎，几年来他们并没有取得任何结果，却增加了越南人民对敌人的仇恨和战斗力，生产更加上升。他在联欢会上把今年四月二十九日在太原省击落的美国雷公式飞机残片，也是越南人民击落美帝的第一千架飞机的残片，以及有关画册，赠送给公社社员。
    联欢会自始至终洋溢着中越两国人民战斗友谊的气氛，两国同志合唱《团结就是力量》等歌曲。越南艺术家们今天还参观了公社的鸭场和养猪场等单位。郭兆祥向客人们介绍了公社的生产情况。
