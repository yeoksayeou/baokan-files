To the Editors:

    After seeing the film "Catching Conscripts," I feel that this film has many problems in all aspects. I now put forward the following points of view for your reference:
      (1) In the old society, catching conscripts mainly targeted the poor. The Kuomintang's conscription caused many parents to lose their children, many women to lose their husbands, and many children to lose their fathers, leaving countless working people separated from their families and their families ruined. This is an unpayable debt of sin that Chiang Kai-shek owes the people. This is a class hatred that we can never forget. However, the film portrays conscription as a disaster for the landlord class, focusing on the infighting between the village head and the landlord. I think the direction is completely reversed. What effect can this have on ourselves? What educational significance can it have?
      (2) The film reflects that conscription not only caught the poor, but even the landlord's sons could not escape. I think this is also a complete distortion of historical facts. Looking back sixteen years, was it a must for the landlord's sons to become soldiers? Was it really necessary for the landlord's sons to become peddlers if they didn't become soldiers? Was the landlord's life as bitter as reflected in the film? If young people who do not know the truth watch the movie, wouldn't they sympathize with the landlords? Wouldn't it paralyze their revolutionary fighting spirit?
      (3) The landlord's life reflected in the film is very frugal. The landlord has only one dish on the table when he drinks, and he even licks the table when he spills a little wine. The landlord does not work, and his property is obtained through exploitation. How can he cherish the fruits of labor? Perhaps the author believes that this description is meant to illustrate that the landlord is stingy and miserly. I think the landlord is very stingy and miserly. However, this is not in relation to himself, nor to his family, but to the poor. They love money like their lives and are greedy by nature. For money, they even go so far as to take the lives of the poor. This is the class nature of the landlord. Whether the film writes about the landlord's frugality, stinginess, or miserliness, if it does not write about their exploitation of the poor, wouldn't it cover up their reactionary essence?
      (4) The film reflects that the landlord's entire family is illiterate and does not even recognize their own names. When the eldest son sends two thousand yuan home, it is defrauded by the village head. I think this is also untrue. In the past, only the poor had no money to study. I have never heard that landlords could not go to school. The landlord is an exploiting class. They practice usury, collect rent, keep accounts, and use the abacus. How can they do this if they are illiterate? Isn't this exonerating the landlord class?
      (5) The film depicts the village head aiming his gun at the landlord when a conflict arises between the village head and the landlord. Who is the village head's gun aimed at? In the old society, the village head's gun was aimed at the people and the poor. But in the film, the village head's gun is aimed at the landlord instead. The Kuomintang reactionary government represents the interests of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. Can the village head treat the landlord like this? In the old society, the real situation was that the village head tried every means to extort money and manpower from the poor, not trying every means to extort from the landlord as reflected in the film. The village head and the landlord have always been in cahoots. No one can deny this!
      (6) In the film, when the landlord's eldest son is about to arrive home, there is a grand fanfare, full of spirit, as if a happy event is coming soon and a heroic figure is to be welcomed. What kind of emotion does the film express? My answer is, the emotion of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. Because it praises a hero of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie.
      (7) The film does not depict the exploitation of the poor by the village head, the team leader, the landlord, etc. We only see the village head doing this and that bad thing in the landlord's house, and we can't see anything else. We can think about it. Can this village head, who rectifies the landlord, not be even more ruthless in rectifying the poor? But the film does not reflect this. On the contrary, this village head actually stood up for the poor and rectified the landlord. What kind of reasoning is this?
      (8) The film only writes about one poor family. The old man in this family was forced to death by the landlord and the village head. The son was caught to be a conscript, and later ran away to join the guerrillas. But the film does not have any sympathy for them, but instead, like the landlord, slanderously calls them bandits. And what this person went to do in the end is not explained. He was neither seen joining the People's Liberation Army, nor was he seen coming forward to take revenge later. In the last scene, although it is said that conscription caused a mass riot, only a Kuomintang certificate of appointment was broken, and the landlord, the village head, the team leader, etc., were not overthrown. I think this ending is also very wrong.
      (9) The author uses the exposure of conscription as a name to carry out artistic creation, but after watching the audience, it only causes an unhealthy burst of laughter, and cannot get a trace of class education from the film at all. Conscription was an extremely painful event for the working people in the old society. However, after being reflected on the screen, it is like playing around. I think this is very unserious. Taking the past suffering and past hatred of the working people and putting it on the screen has actually become a satirical comedy. Can this stimulate our class feelings and let the next generation always remember the past suffering and always remember class hatred? The author's attitude is a question worth studying.
      (10) Of course, the author's description of this film cannot be said to be without any basis. In the past Kuomintang-controlled areas, the infighting between the village head and the landlord was not absent. The village head's rectification of the landlord may have also occurred. But this is an extremely individual phenomenon. We cannot take individual phenomena and put them on the screen, in books, and on the stage. The things in the work must have a certain representativeness. If the author wants to write a satirical comedy, I think it is also possible. However, to satirize the Kuomintang reactionaries, to satirize the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, absolutely cannot ridicule the working people. Our authors must not forget what Chairman Mao said, that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and serve politics.
    Chairman Mao said at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: "It is necessary to make literature and art a very good component of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and eliminate the enemy, and help the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind." However, "Catching Conscripts" has helped the enemy in many ways and defended the landlord class. This is completely contrary to Chairman Mao's instructions. Best regards

### 《抓壮丁》为地主阶级作辩护

专栏：

    《抓壮丁》为地主阶级作辩护编辑同志：
    看了《抓壮丁》后，我觉得这部影片在各方面都存在着不少的问题。现在提出如下几点看法，供你们参考：
      （一）旧社会抓壮丁，主要是抓穷人。国民党抓壮丁，使许多父母失去了孩子，许多妇女失去了丈夫，许多孩子失去了父亲，使无数劳动人民妻离子散，家破人亡。这是蒋介石欠下人民的一笔算不清的罪恶账，这是我们永远不能忘记的满腔阶级仇恨。但是，影片把抓壮丁写成是地主阶级的灾难，着重去讲保长和地主之间的钩心斗角。我认为方向完全搞反了。这样，对我们自己能起什么作用呢？能有什么教育意义呢？
      （二）影片反映抓壮丁不但抓穷人，连地主儿子也跑不了。我认为也完全歪曲了历史事实。回顾一下十六年前，地主的儿子是非当兵不可吗？地主的儿子不当兵是真的非要去做小贩不可吗？地主的生活是影片所反映的那么苦吗？如果不知真情实况的青年人，看了电影之后，不会同情地主吗？不会麻痹革命斗志吗？
      （三）影片所反映的地主生活，过得很勤俭。地主喝酒也只有一个菜上桌，碰洒了点酒，还用嘴去桌上嘬。地主不劳动，他的财物是剥削来的，怎么会爱惜劳动成果呢？也许作者认为，这样描写，是在说明地主很小气，很吝啬。我认为，地主是很小气，很吝啬的。可是，不是对自己而言，也不是对他的家庭而言，而是对穷人而言。他们爱财如命，贪婪成性。为了钱，他们甚至不惜去要穷人的性命。这才是地主的阶级本性。影片写地主勤俭也罢，小气、吝啬也罢，如果不写他们对穷人的剥削，不就掩盖了他们的反动本质吗？
      （四）影片反映地主全家一字不识，连自己姓名也不认得，大儿子寄两千元回家，竟被保长诓去了。我认为这也是不真实的。过去只有穷人没有钱念书，从来没听说过地主也不能上学。地主是剥削阶级。他们放高利贷、收租、记账、打算盘，不识字能行吗？这样写，难道不是为地主阶级开脱吗？
      （五）影片描写保长与地主发生了矛盾，就用枪口对准了地主。保长的枪口，到底是对付谁的？在旧社会里，保长的枪口，是对付人民的，是对付穷人的。可是影片里保长的枪口，反而对准了地主。国民党反动政府是代表地主阶级、资产阶级的利益的。保长能这样对付地主吗？在旧社会里，真实的情况是，保长千方百计敲诈穷人，要钱要人；而不象影片所反映的那样，千方百计敲诈地主。保长和地主从来都是一个鼻孔通气的。这谁也不能否认！
      （六）在影片里，当地主的大儿子快来到家门之前，乐声大作，神气十足，好象不久就有喜事到来、要欢迎一位英雄人物似的，结果到来的却是一位蒋匪反动军官。影片表现出来的是一种什么感情呢？我的回答是，地主阶级、资产阶级感情。因为它歌颂一位地主阶级、资产阶级的英雄。
      （七）影片里更没有描写保长、队长、地主等对穷人的剥削。我们只看到保长在地主家干出了这样那样的坏勾当，其余什么也看不见了。我们可以想想看，这样能整地主的保长，不会更加厉害的整穷人吗？可是影片并未反映出这一点。相反，这位保长，倒是给穷人出了气，整了地主。这是一种什么道理？
      （八）影片里只写了一个穷人的家庭。这个家庭的老头子被地主、保长逼死了，儿子被抓去当壮丁，后来跑去参加了游击队。可是影片对他们一点同情都没有，倒是口口声声和地主一样，诬蔑说是当土匪去了。而且这个人到底是干什么去了，最后也没有作交代。既没见他参加解放军，后来又没见他出面来报仇。在最后的一个镜头里，虽然说是抓壮丁引起了群众暴动，可是只打破了一张蒋介石的委任状，地主、保长、队长等等，也还并没有打倒。我认为，这个结尾也是十分不对头的。
      （九）作者以揭露抓壮丁为名，进行艺术创作，可是，观众看完后，只是引起不健康的一顿笑声而已，根本不能从影片得到一丝一毫的阶级教育。抓壮丁，在旧社会里，对劳动人民来说，是一个极其痛苦的事件。可是反映到银幕上后，反而象闹着玩一样，我认为这是非常不严肃的。拿劳动人民过去的苦、过去的仇恨，放到银幕上来，竟然变成了讽刺喜剧。这样能激发我们的阶级感情，能让下一代永远记住过去苦、永远记住阶级仇吗？作者的态度，是一个很值得研究的问题。
      （十）当然，作者描写这部影片，也不能说一点依据也没有。在过去国民党统治区内，保长和地主之间的钩心斗角不是没有的。保长整地主的事也可能出现过。但是这是极其个别的现象。我们不能拿个别现象，放到银幕上来，放在书本中和舞台上来。作品里的事情，是要有一定的代表性的。如果作者想写讽刺喜剧，我认为也是可以的。但是，要讽刺国民党反动派，讽刺地主阶级、资产阶级，绝对不能挖苦劳动人民。我们的作者千万不能忘记了毛主席说的，文艺是要为工农兵服务，为政治服务的。
    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上说：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”可是，《抓壮丁》却在很多方面，帮助了敌人，给地主阶级作了辩护。这是完全违背毛主席的指示的。此致敬礼
