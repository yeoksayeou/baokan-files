    The so-called "Ministerial Conference of the Asian and Pacific Region" held in Seoul ended hastily on June 16 after three days. This is an important step by US imperialism, after shifting its strategic focus eastward, to intensify the formation of an "Asian anti-communist alliance" centered on Japan, and to plot the expansion of its war of aggression in Asia. It is also a component of the Soviet-US collusion to jointly oppose China and the people of Asia.

    This Seoul anti-communist conference was entirely planned by US imperialism.

    As early as February of this year, US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Bundy clamored for US imperialism's lackeys and puppets in Asia to form an "alliance to contain China." The Japanese magazine *Economist*, published on April 19, also revealed that the Seoul anti-communist conference was "to respond to the US policy of containing China" and "to gather and strengthen the anti-communist system to encircle China." On May 26, US Secretary of State Rusk publicly stated that the United States was very concerned about this Seoul anti-communist conference. This clearly shows that US imperialism is the general director of this conference.

    Participants in this conference included Japan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, "Malaysia," Thailand, South Vietnam, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, all of whom are accomplices, vassals, and running dogs of US imperialism. They are all tools for US imperialism to launch wars of aggression in Asia. Now, the Johnson administration wants to gather them together to form a single anti-communist military bloc to patch up its military strategic system for aggression in Asia, intensify its military encirclement of China, and deploy armed attacks against the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. At the meeting, many "representatives" issued狂热反共反华叫嚣 (kuángrè fǎngòng fǎnhuá jiàoxiāo/fervent anti-communist and anti-China outcries). Park Chung-hee, the US running dog in South Korea, clamored at the meeting: "In a showdown with international communism, the use of force is necessary and inevitable." The joint communiqué of the conference openly "expressed sympathy" for the South Vietnamese puppet clique and supported US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. This was a black meeting frantically opposing the people of China, Korea, Vietnam, and the people of Asian countries, a black meeting plotting a war of aggression.

    It is worth noting that Japanese militarists have been particularly enthusiastic in participating in the conspiracy activities in Seoul. It actively serves US imperialism's policy of aggression and war, attempting to rely on the United States to realize its ambition for external expansion and aggression. After the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" was signed last December, the black hand of Japanese militarists further extended into South Korea. The "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" has in fact been formed. However, Japanese militarists are not satisfied with this. It is trying to rely on the power of US imperialism to strengthen its control over the Southeast Asian region. The so-called "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference" held in Tokyo in April was an important step by Japanese militarists to intensify expansion in the Southeast Asian region. And at this Seoul anti-communist conference, Japanese militarists played a major role again.

    US imperialism is hastily piecing together its accomplices, minions, and running dogs in the Asian and Pacific regions, urging them to work harder for US aggressive policies and war policies, which precisely shows the extreme difficulty of US imperialism's situation and exposes the extreme weakness of US imperialism. Due to the vigorous development of the anti-US revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, due to the successive victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against US aggression and national salvation, and especially because the Chinese people have become a powerful fortress that firmly opposes US imperialism's policy of aggression and war and resolutely supports the anti-US struggles of the people of all countries, US imperialism, in coordination with Soviet revisionism, has shifted the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia. The United States has concentrated the main part of its overseas military forces in the Asian and Western Pacific regions, mainly targeting China with its aggressive spearhead, and is frantically expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, attempting to intensify the suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asian countries. But what is the result? Socialist China is getting stronger and stronger. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against US aggression and national salvation has achieved successive victories. The flames of the anti-imperialist revolution of the Asian people are burning more and more fiercely. At the same time, the various military blocs controlled by US imperialism, such as the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," the "Central Treaty Organization," and the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," are in fact in a state of disintegration, paralysis, and collapse. At the North Atlantic military group conference at the end of last year, US Secretary of Defense McNamara loudly called on his "allies" to join him in "containing" China, but the response was very cold. It was under these circumstances that US imperialism hastily planned the Seoul anti-communist conference, attempting to piece together the so-called "Asian anti-communist alliance." This shows that no matter how great the failure US imperialism suffers, no matter how unfavorable the situation it faces, and no matter how difficult the situation it is in, it always has to struggle desperately and counterattack frantically. However, US imperialism helplessly begs its own collection of garbage, pulling out the likes of Park Chung-hee, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Chiang Kai-shek to form a formation. This can only show that US imperialism has exhausted its tricks, once again exposing that it is indeed a paper tiger.

    Regarding the Seoul anti-communist conference, the Soviet revisionist leading group also issued a statement, hypocritically expressing condemnation. But anyone with discernment knows that this is completely deceptive. The Soviet leaders have long betrayed the people of Asia and the people of the world. They have formed a counter-revolutionary alliance with US imperialism, frantically hostile to and undermining the revolutionary movement of the people of Asia and the people of the world. The Soviet leaders have long colluded with US imperialism to carry out rampant anti-China activities. They adapt to the needs of US imperialism to encircle China, doing everything possible to help the United States build a so-called "wall of containment" around China. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet leaders have been colluding with US imperialism, running around and working for the Johnson administration's "peace talks" conspiracy. The Soviet leaders have always supported the Indian reactionaries against China and expanded outward. The Soviet leaders are flirting with Japanese militarism, flattering the Japanese reactionaries as a "stabilizing force in Asia." The Soviet leaders are also colluding with the Indonesian reactionaries, the Thai reactionaries, and "Malaysia." They even sent representatives to sit on the same bench with the "representatives" of the puppet groups of South Korea, South Vietnam, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and participated in a series of meetings held in Asia that were hostile to the Chinese people and the people of Asia. All these facts prove that the Soviet revisionist leading group is an accomplice of US imperialism's aggression in Asia, a destroyer of the revolutions of the people of Asian countries, and has even degenerated to the point of shamefully colluding with the puppets and running dogs of US imperialism. The facts are very clear that to oppose US imperialism and its running dogs, we must oppose Soviet modern revisionism and must never engage in any "united action" with them.

    Now, people clearly see that the Chinese people have friends all over the world, and the vast people of all countries in the world demand friendship with China, support China, and praise China. Who exactly in the world is opposing China? It is nothing more than a small handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, nothing more than such garbage as Park Chung-hee and Nguyễn Cao Kỳ. Those counter-revolutionary and anti-people demons and monsters oppose China precisely because we resolutely engage in socialism, resolutely oppose imperialism, resolutely oppose modern revisionism, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. The influence of the Chinese revolution is growing, China's international prestige is getting higher and higher, and the beacon of Mao Zedong Thought shines on the whole world, emitting incomparably brilliant light. All this has aroused extreme fear and hatred among all kinds of demons and monsters in the world, which is not surprising.

    The Seoul anti-communist conference is actually nothing more than a circus performance directed by Washington. The Chinese people and the people of all Asian countries simply do not put US imperialism in their eyes, let alone this small handful of US imperialism's puppets and running dogs. US imperialism, this paper tiger, has been poked full of holes in Asia. Now it wants to rely on these puppets and running dogs to save its fate of complete failure. Isn't this very ridiculous? In today's Asia, the revolutionary torrent is surging. The US aggressors are trapped in the heavy encirclement of the people of all countries, facing the disaster of annihilation. Now, it is pulling out some of the puppets and running dogs it has raised to the battlefield, which can at most only add a few more funerary objects.

    US imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people. The Chinese people stand unswervingly with the revolutionary people of all Asian countries, support each other, and fight to smash all aggressive conspiracies and counter-revolutionary plans plotted by US imperialism and its running dogs. No matter how many accomplices and running dogs serve US imperialism, the complete failure of the US aggressors in Asia is inevitable, and the people of all Asian countries will surely win the final victory in the anti-US revolutionary struggle.

    黔驴技穷
　　观察家
    在汉城举行的所谓“亚洲和太平洋地区部长会议”，开了三天之后，于六月十六日草草收场。这是美帝国主义在它的战略重点东移以后，加紧拼凑以日本为核心的“亚洲反共联盟”，策划在亚洲扩大侵略战争的一个重要步骤。这也是苏美加紧勾结联合反对中国、反对亚洲人民的阴谋的一个组成部分。
    这次汉城反共会议，完全是由美帝国主义一手策划的。
    早在今年二月间，美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿邦迪就曾叫嚷，要美帝国主义在亚洲的仆从和傀儡组成一个“遏制中国的联盟”。四月十九日出版的日本《经济学人》杂志也透露，汉城反共会议是“为了呼应美国的遏制中国的政策”，“是为了集结和加强反共体制，以包围中国”。五月二十六日，美国国务卿腊斯克公开表示美国对这次汉城反共会议十分关心。这就清楚地表明，美帝国主义是这次会议的总导演。
    参加这次会议的有日本、菲律宾、澳大利亚、新西兰、“马来西亚”、泰国、南越、南朝鲜和蒋介石匪帮等，全部都是美帝国主义的帮凶、附庸和走狗。它们都是美帝国主义在亚洲发动侵略战争的工具。现在，约翰逊政府想把它们纠集在一起，组成一个单一的反共军事集团，来补缀它侵略亚洲的军事战略体系，加紧它对中国的军事包围，部署对中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的武装进攻和进一步扩大侵略越南的战争。在会上，不少“代表”发出了狂热的反共反华叫嚣。美国在南朝鲜的走狗朴正熙在会上叫嚷：“在同国际共产主义摊牌中，使用武力是必要的和不可避免的”。会议的联合公报公然对南越傀儡集团“表示同情”，支持美帝国主义侵略越南。这是一次疯狂反对中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民和亚洲各国人民的黑会，是一次策划侵略战争的黑会。
    值得注意的是，日本军国主义者特别起劲地参与了在汉城进行的阴谋活动。它积极地为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，妄图以美国为靠山，实现它对外扩张和侵略的野心。去年十二月，“日韩条约”签订之后，日本军国主义者的黑手，进一步伸进了南朝鲜。“东北亚军事联盟”事实上已经形成。但是，日本军国主义者并不以此为满足。它力图倚仗美帝国主义的势力，加强控制东南亚地区。今年四月，在东京召开的所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”，是日本军国主义者对东南亚地区加紧扩张的重要步骤。而在这一次的汉城反共会议上，日本军国主义者又扮演了一个主要的角色。
    美帝国主义七拼八凑，急于把它在亚洲及太平洋地区的帮凶、娄罗和走狗纠集在一起，要它们进一步替美国的侵略政策和战争政策卖力气，这正好说明美帝国主义处境的极端困难，暴露了美帝国主义的极端虚弱。由于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民反美革命斗争蓬勃发展，由于越南人民抗美救国斗争节节胜利，特别是由于中国人民已经成为坚持反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、坚决支持各国人民反美斗争的强大堡垒，美帝国主义在苏联修正主义的配合下，把它的反革命全球战略重点从欧洲转移到了亚洲。美国已经把派驻海外军事力量的主要部分，集中在亚洲及西太平洋地区，把侵略矛头主要指向中国，并且疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，力图加紧镇压亚洲各国人民的革命斗争。但是，结果如何呢？社会主义的中国越来越强大。越南人民抗美救国斗争取得节节胜利。亚洲人民的反帝革命火焰越燃越炽烈。与此同时，美帝国主义所控制的各种军事集团，如“北大西洋公约组织”、“中央条约组织”和“东南亚条约组织”，事实上都处于分崩离析和瘫痪、瓦解的状态。在去年年底的北大西洋军事集团的会议上，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉曾经大声疾呼，要它的“盟国”同它一起来“遏制”中国，但是反应十分冷淡。正是在这种情况下，美帝国主义匆匆忙忙地策划了汉城反共会议，企图拼凑所谓“亚洲反共联盟”。这表明，美帝国主义不管遭到多么大的失败，面临着多么不利的形势和多么困难的处境，它总是要拚命挣扎、疯狂反扑的。但是，美帝国主义无可奈何地乞怜于它自己搜罗的一些垃圾，把朴正熙、阮高其和蒋介石之流，拉出来摆成一个阵势。这只能表明，美帝国主义已是黔驴技穷，再一次暴露了它确确实实是一只纸老虎。
    对于汉城反共会议，苏联修正主义领导集团也发表了一个声明，假惺惺地表示谴责。但明眼人一望便知，这完全是骗人的。苏联领导人早已背叛了亚洲人民和世界人民。他们同美帝国主义结成了反革命的同盟，疯狂敌视和破坏亚洲人民和世界人民的革命运动。苏联领导人早就同美帝国主义勾结起来，进行猖狂的反华活动。他们适应美帝国主义包围中国的需要，千方百计地帮助美国在中国的周围建立一道所谓“遏制的墙”。在越南问题上，苏联领导人一直同美帝国主义串通一气，为约翰逊政府的“和谈”阴谋，奔走效劳。苏联领导人一直支持印度反动派反对中国，向外扩张。苏联领导人同日本军国主义打得火热，恭维日本反动派是什么“亚洲的安定力量”。苏联领导人同印度尼西亚反动派、泰国反动派以及“马来西亚”也勾勾搭搭，他们甚至派出代表同南朝鲜、南越等傀儡集团和蒋介石匪帮的“代表”坐在一条板凳上，参加了在亚洲举行的一系列敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的会议。所有这些事实证明，苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义侵略亚洲的帮凶，是亚洲各国人民革命的破坏者，甚至已经堕落到同美帝国主义的傀儡和走狗同流合污的可耻地步。事实十分清楚，要反对美帝国主义及其走狗，就必须反对苏联现代修正主义，绝不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。
    现在，人们清楚地看到，中国人民的朋友遍天下，世界各国的广大人民要求同中国友好，拥护中国，赞扬中国。世界上究竟是哪些人在反对中国呢？无非就是一小撮帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，无非就是朴正熙、阮高其这些垃圾。那些反革命、反人民的妖魔鬼怪反对中国，正是因为我们坚决搞社会主义，坚决反对帝国主义，坚决反对现代修正主义，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。中国革命的影响越来越大，中国的国际威望越来越高，毛泽东思想的灯塔照耀着全世界，发射出无比灿烂的光芒。这一切引起了世界上形形色色牛鬼蛇神的极端恐惧和仇恨，是毫不奇怪的。
    汉城反共会议，其实不过是华盛顿导演的一场马戏团的表演。中国人民和亚洲各国人民，根本不把美帝国主义放在眼里，何况是这一小撮美帝国主义的傀儡和走狗。美帝国主义这只纸老虎在亚洲已经被戳得千疮百孔，现在它想依靠这些傀儡和走狗来挽救它彻底失败的命运，这岂不是十分可笑吗？在今天的亚洲，革命的洪流汹涌澎湃。美国侵略者陷于各国人民的重重包围之中，面临着灭顶之灾。现在，它把自己豢养的一些傀儡和走狗拉出来上阵，充其量只能增加几个殉葬品而已。
    美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人。中国人民坚定不移地同亚洲各国革命人民站在一起，互相支持，为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗所策划的一切侵略阴谋和反革命计划而斗争。不管有多少帮凶和走狗为美帝国主义效劳，美国侵略者在亚洲的彻底失败是不可避免的，亚洲各国人民一定能够赢得反美革命斗争的最后胜利。
