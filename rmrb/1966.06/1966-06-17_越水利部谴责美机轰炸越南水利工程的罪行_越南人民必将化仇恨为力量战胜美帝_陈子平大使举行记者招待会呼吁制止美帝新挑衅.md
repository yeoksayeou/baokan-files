    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 13th. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 13th, strongly condemning the towering crime of US imperialism in intensifying its dispatch of aircraft to attack water conservancy projects and dikes in North Vietnam.
    The statement, announced by Phan My, Deputy Minister of Water Resources, at a press conference held on the afternoon of the 13th, pointed out that from February to May this year alone, US aircraft bombed various water conservancy projects in North Vietnam more than 500 times, including 49 bombings of dikes. In particular, recently, US imperialism has expanded the bombing of various dikes in North Vietnam. The statement pointed out that attacking water conservancy projects and dikes of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is an extremely serious act of war by the US authorities and part of their extremely vicious conspiracy to intensify the "escalation" of the war against North Vietnam.
    The statement severely condemned and accused the US government of deliberately using the bombing of water conservancy projects and dikes to cause floods and droughts, pointing out that this is the most heinous and most brutal war action that even Hitler's crimes in the past cannot compare with. This proves that US imperialism is consistently unwilling to abandon any barbaric means. This is a serious provocation to all progressive humanity and a blatant trampling on the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue and international law.
    The statement said that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are deeply convinced that the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice, including the American people, will resolutely condemn and stop this crime of US imperialism.
    The statement concluded by saying that US war criminals must be severely punished. The Vietnamese people, who have a glorious tradition of overcoming natural disasters and enemy misfortunes, will surely turn hatred into strength, resolutely fight to the end, actively overcome all difficulties, defend themselves, defend production, and ultimately defeat the American invading bandits.
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Trần Tử Bình, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists this afternoon, distributing a statement recently issued by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam condemning the towering crime of US imperialism in intensifying the bombing of water conservancy projects and dikes in North Vietnam.
    The statement condemned US imperialism's attempt to intensify and expand the bombing and strafing of water conservancy projects in North Vietnam in the upcoming rainy season, in order to achieve the criminal purpose of destroying agriculture and devastating a large number of villages and densely populated areas in the northern plains. This fully exposes that US imperialism not only violates the most basic principles of international law and tramples on the 1954 Geneva Accords, but also tramples on the most basic principles of humanity.
    The statement pointed out that the criminal acts of US imperialism can only show its weakness and failure in the war of aggression against South Vietnam. The statement said that no matter how adventurously US imperialism sends 300,000, 400,000, or more aggressor troops to South Vietnam, and no matter how frantic its bombing and strafing of North Vietnam reaches, it will surely be resolutely countered by our entire people and will be thoroughly defeated.
    Ambassador Trần Tử Bình said at the press conference: We earnestly call on the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice, including the American people, to more forcefully condemn the criminal actions of US imperialism, to stop US imperialism from realizing its malicious conspiracy in time, and to vigorously support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialism.

    越水利部谴责美机轰炸越南水利工程的罪行
    越南人民必将化仇恨为力量战胜美帝
    陈子平大使举行记者招待会呼吁制止美帝新挑衅
    新华社河内十三日电　越南民主共和国水利部十三日发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义加强派遣飞机袭击越南北方水利工程和堤坝的滔天罪行。
    越南水利部副部长潘美在十三日下午举行的记者招待会上公布的这项声明指出，仅从今年二月到五月，美国飞机对越南北方各个水利工程的轰炸就达五百次以上，其中轰炸堤坝达四十九次。特别是在最近，美帝国主义还扩大对越南北方的各个堤坝的轰炸。声明指出，袭击越南民主共和国的水利工程和堤坝，是美国当局的极端严重的战争行动，是它加强对越南北方进行“升级”战争的极其恶毒阴谋的一部分。
    声明严厉谴责和控诉美国政府蓄意用轰炸水利工程和堤坝来造成水灾和旱灾的罪行，指出这是连过去希特勒的罪行也无可比拟的最令人发指的、最凶暴的战争行动。这证明美帝国主义是始终不肯放弃任何一种野蛮手段的。这是对全体进步人类的严重挑衅，是对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议和国际法的粗暴践踏。
    声明说，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府深信全世界爱好和平和主持公理的人民，其中包括美国人民在内，将会坚决谴责并制止美帝国主义的这种罪行。
    声明最后说，美国战争罪犯必须受到严厉惩罚。有着战胜天灾敌祸光荣传统的越南人民，必将把仇恨化为力量，坚决战斗到底，积极克服一切困难，来保卫自己，保卫生产，最后必定战胜美国侵略强盗。
    新华社十六日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，今天下午举行中外记者招待会，散发越南民主共和国水利部最近发表的关于谴责美帝国主义加强轰炸越南北方水利工程和堤坝的滔天罪行的声明。
    声明谴责美帝国主义妄图在即将到来的雨季中加强和扩大轰炸扫射越南北方水利工程，以达到破坏农业，毁坏北部平原的大量村庄和人口稠密区的罪恶目的。这充分暴露了美帝国主义不仅违反了国际公法的最起码的原则，践踏了一九五四年日内瓦协议，而且还践踏了人类最起码的法则。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的罪恶行为只能表明它在侵略越南南方的战争中的虚弱和失败。声明说，不管美帝国主义冒险把三十万、四十万或者更多的侵略军派到越南南方，也不管它对越南北方的轰炸扫射达到何等疯狂的程度，它一定会遭到我们全国人民的坚决反击，并将被彻底击败。
    陈子平大使在记者招待会上说：我们恳切呼吁全世界爱好和平和主持公理的人民，其中包括美国人民在内，更有力地谴责美帝国主义的罪恶行动，及时制止美帝国主义实现它的恶毒阴谋，大力支持越南人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。
