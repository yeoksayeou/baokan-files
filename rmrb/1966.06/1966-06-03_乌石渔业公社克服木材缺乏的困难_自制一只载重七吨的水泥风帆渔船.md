    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou - The Wushi Fisheries Commune in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, recently trial-produced a seven-ton cement sailboat. The first fishing trip of this boat increased production by about 20% compared to similar wooden boats, and it is very popular among fishermen.
    Haikang County is located in the Leizhou Peninsula, where there are few forests and a shortage of wood. In the past, shipbuilding required purchasing wood from Hainan Island, which was very expensive. After studying the Dazhai's self-reliance experience, the commune members of Wushi Fisheries Commune proposed the requirement of manufacturing cement fishing boats. The Zhanjiang Prefectural Aquatic Products Bureau supported them, sent personnel for technical guidance, and the first cement fishing boat was built in less than a month.
    This type of cement fishing boat has a solid structure, a light hull, seamless overall connection, strong wind and impact resistance, large buoyancy, shallow draft, and a smooth hull surface with low resistance, making it faster than similar wooden sailboats, thus resulting in better operational efficiency than wooden boats.
    Except for a small amount of wood used for the mast, rudder, keelson, hatch cover, and keel, the entire hull of this type of cement fishing boat is made of wire mesh and cement mortar. The cost is 20% lower than wooden fishing boats of the same tonnage and type, and it also saves a large amount of wood, tung oil, iron nails, and other materials. Because cement boats do not leak water, after being put into production, there is no need to spend labor bailing water or baking the boat. The fresh water consumed by the crew will not be salinized, which saves repair costs, improves the departure rate, and also improves the working and living conditions of the fishermen.

    乌石渔业公社克服木材缺乏的困难
    自制一只载重七吨的水泥风帆渔船
    新华社广州电　广东省海康县乌石渔业公社最近试制了一只载重七吨的水泥风帆渔船。这只船第一次出海捕鱼比同类木船增产二成左右，很受渔民欢迎。
    海康县地处雷州半岛，森林少，木材缺乏，过去造船都要到海南岛采购木材，成本很高。乌石渔业公社的社员，学习了大寨的自力更生经验之后，就提出制造水泥渔船的要求。湛江专署水产局支持他们，派人员进行技术指导，用了不到一个月的时间，第一只水泥渔船就造出来了。
    这种水泥渔船，结构坚固，船身轻，整体联接无缝，抗风和抗冲击能力强，浮力大，吃水浅，船壁表面光滑，阻力小，航速比同类木质风帆渔船快，因而作业效果比木船好。
    这种水泥渔船，除了船桅、舵、插板、仓盖和弦龙骨用少量的木材外，整个船身都是用钢丝网和水泥沙浆制成，造价比同吨位同类型的木质渔船低百分之二十，还节省了大量的木材、桐油和铁钉等材料。因为水泥船不会渗漏水，投入生产后，不用花费劳动力戽水，也不用烤船，船员食用的淡水也不会被咸化，既节约修理费用，提高了出航率，也改善了渔民的劳动条件和生活条件。
