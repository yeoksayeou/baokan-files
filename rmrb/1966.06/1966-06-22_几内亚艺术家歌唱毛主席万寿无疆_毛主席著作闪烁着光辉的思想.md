    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st – The Guinean National Djoliba Dance Company concluded its visit and performances in Hangzhou and departed for Shanghai by bus today.

    During his stay in Hangzhou, Mr. Sissoko Amadou, the General Director of the dance company, told Chinese friends that the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in construction have strengthened the forces of world peace. These achievements were made under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. He said that as the members of the Guinean dance company learn more about China, they love Chairman Mao even more and love Chairman Mao's works even more.

    Gonde Souri, an actor of the dance company, reads Chairman Mao's works every night. He said, "Reading Chairman Mao's books has taught me a lot and given me a lot of wisdom."

    Actor Keita Manseli said: "I have read Volume IV of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong once, and now I am carefully reading it for the second time. I see the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought between the lines." Drummer Kamara Seguba specifically brought back a copy of Chairman Mao's works for his younger brother. He said, "After reading Chairman Mao's books, my younger brother will know how to be a good person."

    The dance company arrived in Hangzhou on the 14th. They performed three shows in Hangzhou and were warmly welcomed by the audience. Last night, the Chinese hosts held a farewell banquet for them.

    At the banquet, Kouyate Sori Kondia, the Deputy General Director of the dance company, passionately sang "Long Live Chairman Mao," and all the members clapped in unison, chanting "Ah, Chairman Mao, we wish you a long, long life!"

    This famous West African singer expressed great admiration after seeing an embroidery of Chairman Mao working on an airplane during a visit. He said that this embroidery showed him how Chairman Mao was working for the people and painting a picture of the future for mankind.

    毛主席著作闪烁着光辉的思想
    据新华社杭州二十一日电  几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团结束了在杭州的访问演出，今天乘车前往上海。
    舞蹈团总团长西索柯·阿马杜在杭州期间向中国朋友说，中国人民在建设中取得的辉煌成就，加强了世界和平的力量，这些成就是在毛泽东主席领导下取得的。他说，几内亚舞蹈团成员们随着对中国了解的增多，更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛主席著作。
    舞蹈团的演员贡德·索里每天晚上读毛主席著作。他说：“读了毛主席的书，使我知道了很多东西，给了我很多智慧。”
    演员凯塔·芒塞利说：“《毛泽东选集》第四卷我已读了一遍，现在正仔细读第二遍，我从字里行间看到了毛泽东思想的光辉。”鼓手卡马拉·塞古巴特地给他弟弟带回一部毛主席著作。他说：“读了毛主席的书，我的弟弟就会知道怎样做人。”
    舞蹈团是十四日到达杭州的。他们在杭州演出三场，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。昨晚，中国主人为他们举行了欢送宴会。
    宴会上，舞蹈团副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚满怀激情地歌唱毛泽东主席万寿无疆，全体团员一齐击掌相和“啊，毛主席呀，祝你万寿无疆！”
    这位西非著名的歌唱家在参观中看到毛主席在飞机上工作的一幅绣象后表示非常喜爱，他说，这幅绣象使他看到毛主席怎样在为人民工作，在为人类描绘前景。
