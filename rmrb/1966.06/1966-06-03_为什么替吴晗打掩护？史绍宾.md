Title: Why Cover Up for Wu Han?

    In the article "Hu Shi and Wu Han" (People's Daily, April 13, 1966), we quoted two letters exchanged between Hu Shi and Wu Han. Many comrades inquired about how these materials were obtained. It's a long story. There's a twisty process involved, a small episode in the current fierce class struggle.

    Before the national liberation, Hu Shi hastily fled the mainland, leaving behind a batch of archives, including the correspondence between Wu Han and him. These archives were later preserved at the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, directly controlled by the relevant responsible persons of the institute.

    Since the criticism of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began last November, everyone has been expecting the comrades in charge of the Institute of Modern History to fully utilize the expertise of their colleagues, take advantage of the institute's superior conditions, especially the Hu Shi archives they possess, and actively engage in this struggle to expose Wu Han's true face of anti-communism, anti-people, and counter-revolution.

    Strangely, for months, the criticism of Wu Han has been so intense and widespread across the country that many workers, peasants, and soldiers wielding hammers, hoes, and guns have taken up pens to join the battle. However, the Institute of Modern History, which has attracted much attention, has been quiet and inactive under the leadership of certain individuals in power. Wu Han threw out his "self-criticism," using his "glorious history" as a shield, attempting to counterattack, but the Institute of Modern History did not say a word. Wu Han's active advocate, Shi Hanren, clamored for critics of Wu Han to produce all the materials, but the Institute of Modern History remained silent.

    The Institute of Modern History, capable of making "authoritative" statements, has failed to live up to expectations. Outsiders are unaware of the underlying reasons. Your unwillingness to expose is also an attitude, and others cannot be "forced to order" you. However, the struggle with Wu Han is not a private matter of one person or institution, but a major event in the class struggle. If you don't move, others will; if you don't expose, others will. It’s not a situation of "only one shop, no branches," where you can perpetually "occupy the latrine without defecating." Therefore, people visiting the Institute of Modern History to borrow Hu Shi's archives have been coming in an endless stream. Everyone assumed that although the institute's responsible person maintained "silence" on the current great debate, they probably wouldn't be "silent" on providing materials!

    However, no one expected that borrowing these materials would be as difficult as "ascending to heaven"! Some were turned away and didn't even get to touch a single page of Hu Shi's archives. We were relatively lucky and got to see a little, but it was still very risky. If it hadn't been for a "chance encounter" and grabbing the "pigtail," we would have been turned away as well. Those with more influence than us saw a bit more.

    We haven't witnessed firsthand what others experienced at the Institute of Modern History, so we won't make any rash comments. However, we will briefly describe our own experience here to broaden comrades' knowledge and add a page of "veritable records" to this unprecedented great debate.

    We arrived at the Institute of Modern History and received a warm welcome. When we mentioned borrowing Hu Shi's diary, they readily agreed and even displayed a "communist" style: "We were originally using it, but since you want it, you can take it all!" This truly made us overjoyed and immensely grateful. However, upon opening it, we couldn't help but laugh. It turned out to be Hu Shi's diaries from 1921 and 1922. At that time, Wu Han was still a twelve or thirteen-year-old child, how could he have any connection with Hu Shi? We had to ask: "As far as we know, Hu Shi's diary is not just these. What about the others?" The reply was very blunt: "These are the only two!" Since they wouldn't show us the diary, we clearly expressed our hope to see the correspondence between Wu Han and Hu Shi. They deliberately evaded, saying, "There are no such letters!" We were certain that others had seen them and that they couldn't possibly not exist. They then equivocated: "They probably haven't been transferred to us, or they're still piled up in those boxes and haven't been sorted out yet!" We later learned that they were lying through their teeth, but at the time, we genuinely believed them. Since they spoke so resolutely and we couldn't see them, what could we do?

    Things turned out to be very coincidental. Later, we saw a card catalog in the room with the words "Hu Shi Archives Catalog" prominently displayed. Upon opening it, the directory of files containing correspondence between Hu Shi and Wu Han was clearly written. This discovery greatly alarmed them. First, they wouldn't let us check it, then they wouldn't let us copy it, saying it was "confidential" and accusing us of various things. However, with the directory in plain sight and the lies exposed, they were in a truly awkward position and had to change their tune: "The letters exist, but some have been taken outside the city, and some are currently in use. You can't see them today." At this point, we still thought it was localism at play, fearing that others would use the materials first. Since they were currently in use, how could we force them to lend them to us? Therefore, we suggested that we just look at them in their office, but they still disagreed. After all this back and forth, two hours passed, and it was almost time to get off work. Having no other choice, we came up with a compromise: "You're not using them when you're eating, right? Can you at least let us see them then? If you can't let us see all of them, can you let us see a selection?" Having been pushed to this point, they could no longer find any excuse to refuse and very reluctantly brought out four files. However, they still manipulated them, removing the main letters from one file and leaving only half a damaged letter to deal with us.

    One of the comrades at the Institute of Modern History who was receiving us probably felt that what they were doing was too outrageous. While we were burying ourselves in copying, he said: In a day or two, all these letters will be printed out, and a full copy will be sent to you. Once bitten, twice shy. This time, we weren't so naive, but rather skeptical. Sure enough, more than a dozen "days or two" passed, and not even half a shadow of this "full copy" of materials had been seen.

    That's how things went. We originally thought this was the evil influence of bourgeois academic overlords monopolizing information. Later, with the deepening of the struggle, looking back and thinking carefully, we realized that our awareness was not high enough, our eyes were not sharp enough, and our sense of smell was not sensitive enough. This matter was not just a manifestation of the bourgeois academic overlord style; it was actually a sharp class struggle.

    Thoroughly exposing Wu Han's anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary history is an important aspect of thoroughly overthrowing this bourgeois "authority." All revolutionaries are actively engaged in this struggle. As a specialized institution researching modern and contemporary Chinese history, and possessing firsthand materials related to Wu Han's dirty history, it has maintained prolonged silence in this fierce class struggle to counterattack the bourgeoisie. We want to ask: Are you a research institution serving the proletariat or a research institution serving the bourgeoisie?

    You don't rise up to expose Wu Han and even use "confidentiality" as an excuse to prevent others from exposing him, tightly wrapping and securely concealing Wu Han's shameful history. What is the purpose of this?

    We believe that the Institute of Modern History should make contributions to this cultural revolution. We also believe that all the revolutionary comrades in the Institute of Modern History will certainly be able to bravely stand up, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly break with the representatives of the bourgeoisie, and actively engage in the current great socialist cultural revolution!

    Postscript: Today we saw the recently published "Historical Research" 1966, Issue 3, containing the editorial department's "Annotation on the Correspondence between Wu Han and Hu Shi". We know that the chief editor of "Historical Research" is one of the responsible persons of the Institute of Modern History. It seems that the current situation of the struggle is forcing them to make a gesture of "criticizing" Wu Han. However, we urge readers to be sure to keep their eyes open and distinguish between genuine and fake. The editor's note to "Annotation on the Correspondence between Wu Han and Hu Shi" is well worth careful consideration. We have re-annotated these thirteen letters, and we ask everyone to compare them. May 18, 1966

    为什么替吴晗打掩护？
    史绍宾
    在《胡适与吴晗》（《人民日报》一九六六年四月十三日）这篇文章中，我们引用了胡适与吴晗的两封来往信件。不少同志打听这些材料是怎样得来的。说来话长。这里面有一番曲折的过程，它是当前这场激烈的阶级斗争的一个小插曲。
    全国解放前夕，胡适匆匆逃出大陆，丢下了一批档案，其中有吴晗和他的来往信件。这批档案，后来保存在中国科学院近代史研究所，由该所有关负责人直接掌握。
    从去年十一月对吴晗的《海瑞罢官》展开批判以来，大家一直期待着，近代史研究所负责的同志能充分发挥本所同志的专长，利用本所的优越条件，特别是他们所掌握的胡适档案，积极投入这场斗争，揭露吴晗反共、反人民、反革命的真实面目。
    令人奇怪的是，几个月来，全国范围内对吴晗的批判进行得这样激烈、这样广泛，许多拿铁锤、拿锄头、拿枪杆的工农兵群众都拿起了笔杆，参加了战斗。而众所瞩目的近代史研究所，在该所个别当权者的领导下，却冷冷清清，不见动静。吴晗抛出了他的“自我批评”，拿他的“光荣历史”作挡箭牌，妄图反攻，近代史研究所没有出来说一句话。吴晗的积极辩护士时汉人叫嚷，批评吴晗的人拿出全部材料来，近代史研究所却仍然一声不吭。
    能够作“权威”发言的近代史研究所，为什么有负众望，其中底细，外人不得而知。你们不愿意揭发，也是一种态度，别人是不好“强迫命令”的。可是，和吴晗的斗争，非一人一机构的私事，而是阶级斗争的大事。你不动，别人要动；你不揭，别人要揭。不是“只此一家，别无分号”，可以老是“占着茅坑不拉屎”的。于是，到近代史研究所登门拜访，借阅胡适档案的人，便络绎不绝。人们都以为，该所负责人对目前的大辩论虽然保持“沉默”，大概不至于要资料也“沉默”吧！
    但是，谁也没有想到，借阅这批材料之难，“难于上青天”！有的人是吃了闭门羹，连一页胡适档案都不曾摸着。我们还算幸运，给看了一点，不过那也危险得很，如果不是有个“巧遇”，抓住了“辫子”，那也同样要吃闭门羹。来头比我们大的，又比我们多看到一点。
    别人在近代史研究所的遭遇究竟如何，没有目睹，不敢妄加议论。我们亲身领教过的，在这里且略述一二，以广同志们的见闻；也给这次空前的大辩论，增添一页“实录”。
    我们到了近代史研究所，蒙受热情招待。一提借阅胡适日记，慨然应允，而且颇有“共产主义”的风格：“我们本来正在用，你们既然要，都可以带走！”真叫人喜出望外，万分感激。但是翻开一看，真是啼笑皆非，原来那是胡适一九二一、一九二二两年的日记。当年的吴晗，还是个十二三岁的娃娃，那能和胡适有什么瓜葛呢？我们不得不问：“据我们所知，胡适日记，不止这些，别的呢？”回答很干脆：“只有这两本！”日记不给看，我们就明白提出希望看吴晗与胡适的往来信件。他们故意推脱，说：“没有这样的信！”我们肯定别人见过，不可能没有。他们又支吾其词：“大概没有移交给我们，或者还堆在那几口箱子里，没有清理出来！”事后我们才知道，这是瞪着眼睛说瞎话，但在当时，我们是确实信以为真了。人家讲得这样斩钉截铁，实在看不到，又有什么办法呢？
    事情十分凑巧。后来，我们在室内看到了一个卡片柜，“胡适档案目录”六字，赫赫在目，打开一看，胡适与吴晗往来信件的案卷目录，写得一清二楚。这一发现，颇令他们着慌。先是不让查，后是不准抄，说是要“保密”，还给我们扣了不少帽子。可是，目录俱在，谎言拆穿，处境实在尴尬，只好改口：“信是有，有的拿到城外去了，有的正在用，今天不能看。”这时，我们还以为，这是本位主义在作怪，怕别人先用这批材料。既然人家正在用，怎么好硬借走呢？于是我们提出，就在他们所里看一看，还是不同意。这样折腾来，折腾去，两个多钟头过去了，快下班了，实在无法，我们又提出个变通办法：“你们吃饭的时候总不用吧，总可以给我们看看；不能全部看，选看一部分也好。”说到这种地步，他们再找不到任何拒绝的遁辞，才非常勉强地拿出四个案卷来。可是，也还要上下其手，把一个案卷的主要信件抽掉，只留下半封残信来应付我们。
    近代史研究所的一位接待的同志，大概自己也觉得这样搞实在太不象话了。在我们埋头赶抄的时候，他表示：过一两天，这些信就可全部打印出来，送一全份给你们。吃一堑，长一智，这一回我们不那么天真，而是将信将疑了。果然，十几个“一两天”过去了，这“一全份”材料还没有见到半点影子。
    事情经过就是如此。我们原来以为，这是资产阶级学阀垄断资料的恶风。后来，随着斗争的深入，回头仔细想想，才觉得我们觉悟不高，眼睛不亮，嗅觉不灵。这件事，哪里只是资产阶级学阀作风的表现而已，实际上也是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。
    彻底揭露吴晗反共、反人民、反革命的历史，是彻底打倒这个资产阶级“权威”的斗争的一个重要方面。一切革命者都在积极地投入这场斗争。作为研究中国近、现代史的一个专门机构，又掌握着有关吴晗肮脏历史的第一手材料，在这场反击资产阶级的激烈的阶级斗争中，却长期保持沉默。我们要问：你们究竟是为无产阶级服务的研究机构，还是为资产阶级服务的研究机构？
    你们不起来揭发吴晗，还借口“保密”，不让别人来揭发，把吴晗见不得人的历史，包得紧紧的，裹得严严的，这究竟是为了什么？
    我们认为，近代史研究所应当在这场文化革命中作出贡献。我们也相信，近代史研究所一切革命的同志，一定能够勇敢地站出来，高举毛泽东思想红旗，同资产阶级的代表人物彻底决裂，积极投入当前这场伟大的社会主义文化大革命！
                        一九六六年五月六日
    附记：今天我们看到了最近出版的《历史研究》一九六六年第三期，载有编辑部的《评注吴晗胡适通信》。我们知道，《历史研究》的主编，就是近代史研究所的一位负责人。看来，目前斗争的形势迫使他们作出“批判”吴晗的姿态。但是，我们请读者千万注意，要擦亮眼睛，辨别真假。《评注吴晗胡适通信》的编者按，很值得认真推敲。我们把这十三封信重新作了按语，请大家对照比较。　一九六六年五月十八日
