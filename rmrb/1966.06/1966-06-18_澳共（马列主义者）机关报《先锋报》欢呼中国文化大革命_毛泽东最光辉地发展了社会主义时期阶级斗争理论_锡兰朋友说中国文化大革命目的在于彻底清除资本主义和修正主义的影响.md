    The Australian Communist (Marxist-Leninist) Organ "Vanguard" Hails the Chinese Cultural Revolution
    Mao Zedong Most Brilliantly Developed the Theory of Class Struggle in the Socialist Period
    Ceylonese Friends Say the Purpose of the Chinese Cultural Revolution Is to Thoroughly Eliminate the Influence of Capitalism and Revisionism
    (Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 16th) The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ "Vanguard" published an article on the 16th entitled "The Victory of Marxism-Leninism in China," hailing the Cultural Revolution movement being carried out by the Chinese people.
    The article pointed out that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a "struggle between the power of the proletarian dictatorship and the power of the bourgeoisie. There are contradictions between proletarian power and bourgeois power, and this is an antagonistic contradiction. The predominantly developing aspect of this contradiction is the strength of the proletarian dictatorship in China."
    The article said that the Chinese Communists encourage and help Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals to master the theory of Marxism-Leninism and make them "philosophers who understand the unity of theory and practice." "They launched a massive movement precisely for this purpose—to let the people think for themselves and act for themselves. They are the people who strengthen this dictatorship, and they are the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people. They have launched a just struggle against all bourgeois capitalist ideas and against a small handful of stubborn elements within China who are trying to restore capitalism."
    The article emphasized that the Chinese people must exercise dictatorship over "a small handful of bourgeois remnants and their followers." These people "have received strong and very strong support from imperialists and modern revisionists. The center of modern revisionism is the leading group of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
    The article said that imperialists are preparing to fight China. They collude with all elements who oppose the proletarian dictatorship in China to carry out conspiracies. "Their loyal allies are the Soviet revisionist group. This group speaks in the name of communism and Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, its activities are more cunning and energetic."
    The article said: "China was liberated in 1949. Conspiracies and provocations against China have never ceased. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have always been very vigilant. The main aspect of their vigilance is to strengthen the Chinese people's widespread understanding of Marxism-Leninism.
      "On the other hand, the imperialists have not been sleeping. They studied the experience of the Soviet Union. They broke through the Soviet Union from within. For them (and for us), this is a matter of great significance—a matter of life and death. But they lamented: 'We have failed to defeat China, which has always been our number one enemy.'
    "In 1966, when their own crisis was greatly intensified, would their efforts be reduced in any way? Of course not!
    "Therefore, this is the situation. Of course, there are also capitalist elements within China. Marx pointed out a hundred years ago that socialism is nurtured in the womb of capitalism: capitalist elements and influences will exist for a long time. Lenin developed this argument, pointing out that the struggle against capitalism and its influence will continue for a long period. Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, as one of his most brilliant contributions to Marxism-Leninism, has summed up and developed this argument from the experiences of China and the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the working class initially won, but now the bourgeoisie has won. China is drawing lessons from this to ensure that the working class continues to hold power."
    The article concluded: "The old-fashioned talk about wonderful socialist victories and everything going smoothly cannot stand up to analysis. An investigation of the facts refutes this. There is struggle now and there will be struggle in the future. This will not be the last manifestation of revisionism in China. The struggle will continue." However, the article emphasized: "We will win. Marxism-Leninism is invincible. The events in China prove this. Marxism-Leninism in the hands of the workers is invincible. We Marxist-Leninists in Australia are happy about the great victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. It helps the advance of the oppressed people of the world."
    (Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 16th) Thomas Appu and Cyril Kuradonga, members of the General Council and Working Committee of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, who recently visited China, spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 15th. Kuradonga said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the torch of the world communist movement." Appu, when talking about the current socialist Cultural Revolution in China, said that it is urgently necessary to carry the revolution through to the end in order to thoroughly eliminate the influence of capitalism and revisionism.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 16th) Vasantha Kumar, a famous Ceylonese dancer, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 14th: "Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the oppressed people all over the world." He also said: "Whenever I read Chairman Mao's works, they always give me great encouragement and strength."
    This progressive Ceylonese artist specifically mentioned Chairman Mao's work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," saying: This work points out the correct direction for artists. As an artist, I often think that I should use art as a weapon to fight.
    Kumar also highly praised the new Chinese clay sculpture art "Rent Collection Courtyard." He said: "When I saw the pictures of this great creation by Chinese artists—which has made such a great contribution to the oppressed people—I was overjoyed. I have never seen such a vivid depiction of the suffering of the oppressed masses." He attributed these achievements to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. Kumar recalled that his wife shed tears when she saw these pictures, which reminded her of the painful experiences she had personally suffered as a tea picker. He said: "The Chinese artists who created this group of clay sculptures must have first learned from the working people and had the same feelings as the working people, otherwise they could not have created such vivid works." He said that the practice of art workers integrating with the working people and participating in labor is very correct.

    澳共（马列主义者）机关报《先锋报》欢呼中国文化大革命
    毛泽东最光辉地发展了社会主义时期阶级斗争理论
    锡兰朋友说中国文化大革命目的在于彻底清除资本主义和修正主义的影响
    据新华社墨尔本十六日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》，十六日以《马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利》为题，发表文章，欢呼中国人民正在开展的文化大革命运动。
    文章指出，中国的文化大革命是一场“无产阶级专政的权力和资产阶级权力之间的斗争。无产阶级权力和资产阶级权力之间是有着矛盾的，这是一种对抗性的矛盾。这个矛盾的占压倒优势的发展的方面，是中国的无产阶级专政的力量。”
    文章说，中国共产党人鼓励和帮助中国工人、农民和知识分子掌握马克思列宁主义的理论，并使他们成为“懂得理论和实践的统一的哲学家”。“他们发动一个规模巨大的运动，正是为了这个目的——让人民自己思考，自己行动。他们是加强这一专政的人，他们是中国人民的绝大多数。他们掀起了一场反对一切资产阶级资本主义思想、反对中国国内一小撮力图使资本主义复辟的顽固分子的行动的正义斗争。”
    文章强调说，中国人民必须对“一小撮资产阶级的残余及其追随者”实行专政。这些人“得到了帝国主义者、现代修正主义者的有力的、十分有力的支持。现代修正主义者的中心是苏联共产党领导集团。”
    文章说，帝国主义者准备同中国作战。他们勾结一切反对中国无产阶级专政的分子进行阴谋活动。“他们的忠实的同盟军是苏联修正主义集团。这个集团假借共产主义、马克思列宁主义的名义说话。因此，它的活动更加狡猾，干得也更加起劲。”
    文章说：“中国在一九四九年获得了解放。反对中国的阴谋和挑衅从来没有停止过。中国共产党人和中国人民一直非常警惕，他们的警惕性的主要方面，就是加强中国人民广泛地对马克思列宁主义的了解。
      “另一方面，帝国主义并没有睡大觉。他们研究了苏联的经验。他们从内部攻破了苏联。对他们说来（对我们说来也是如此），这是一件具有重大意义——决定生与死——的事情。但是他们哀叹：‘我们未能战胜过始终是我们的头号敌人——中国。’
    “在他们自己的危机大大加剧的一九六六年，他们的努力会有任何减少吗？当然不会！
    “因此，情况就是这样。在中国内部当然也有资本主义分子。马克思在一百年前指出，社会主义孕育于资本主义的母腹中：资本主义分子和影响会长期存在。列宁发展了这一论述，他指出，同资本主义及其影响的斗争将继续一个很长的时期。当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东，作为他对马克思列宁主义的最光辉的贡献之一，是从中国和苏联的经验中，总结和发展了这一论述。在苏联，最初工人阶级获得胜利，现在资产阶级取得了胜利。中国正在汲取这方面的教训，以保证工人阶级继续不断掌握政权。”
    文章最后说：“关于美妙的社会主义胜利和一切顺当的老一套说法是经不起分析的。对事实的调查否定了这一点。现在和将来都有斗争。这也不会是修正主义在中国的最后表现。斗争将继续下去。”但是，文章强调说：“我们必胜。马克思列宁主义是打不倒的。中国的事件证明了这一点。掌握在工人手中的马克思列宁主义是战无不胜的。我们澳大利亚的马克思列宁主义者为马克思列宁主义在中国的伟大胜利而感到高兴。它有助于世界被压迫人民的前进。”
    据新华社科伦坡十六日电　最近访问了中国的锡兰工会联合会总理事会和工作委员会成员托马斯·阿普和西里尔·库拉东加十五日向新华社记者发表谈话。库拉东加说：“毛泽东思想是世界共产主义运动的火炬”。阿普在谈到中国当前的社会主义文化大革命时说，迫切需要把革命进行到底，以彻底清除资本主义和修正主义的影响。
    据新华社科伦坡十六日电　锡兰著名舞蹈家瓦山塔·库玛尔十四日对新华社记者说：“毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界被压迫人民的伟大领袖。”他还说：“每当我阅读毛主席著作的时候，总给我极大的鼓舞和力量。”
    这位进步的锡兰艺术家，特别谈到了毛主席的著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，他说：这篇著作指出了艺术家的正确方向。作为一个艺术家，我经常想，我应该用艺术作为武器进行战斗。
    库玛尔还高度地赞扬了中国的新泥塑艺术《收租院》。他说：“当我看到中国艺术家的这一伟大的创作——它对被压迫人民作出了这么大的贡献——的图片时，我高兴得不得了。我过去从来没有看到过这么生动地反映被压迫人民群众受苦的创作。”他把这些成就归功于毛泽东主席的正确领导。库玛尔追述说，他的妻子在看到这些图片时流了泪，这些图片使她想起了她作为一个采茶人亲身遭受的痛苦经历。他说：“创作这组泥塑的中国艺术家一定是先向劳动人民学习，并具有了同劳动人民同样的感情，否则他们不可能创造出这么生动的作品。”他说，艺术工作者必须同劳动人民相结合和参加劳动这一做法是十分正确的。
