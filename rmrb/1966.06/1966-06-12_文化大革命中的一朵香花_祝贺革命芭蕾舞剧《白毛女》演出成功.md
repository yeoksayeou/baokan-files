    A Fragrant Flower in the Cultural Revolution
    ——Congratulations on the Successful Performance of the Revolutionary Ballet "The White-Haired Girl"
    Ding Yi
    Editor's Note: In the current high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl," a fragrant flower cultivated under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, has been warmly praised by the broad masses of the audience since its performance in the capital.
    Today, our newspaper reprints Comrade Ding Yi's article, which, through high praise of "The White-Haired Girl," forcefully refutes the black words of the bourgeois "authority" gentlemen in literary and art circles. These gentlemen have tried their best to slander our revolutionary literature and art, saying that it has "too much class character" and is "class labeling." Under this pretext, they openly oppose Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, attempting to make our revolutionary literature and art forget class struggle, not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not serve proletarian politics, but instead serve bourgeois politics, degenerate into modern revisionist literature and art, and clear the way for capitalist restoration.
    In this great proletarian cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and art workers must thoroughly criticize the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong thought black line in literary and art circles. These gentlemen say there is "too much class character," then we must have more class character, more proletarian class character. The more class character, the more we can consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, the more we can block the road to capitalist restoration. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the revolutionary literary and artistic front, highlight politics, adhere to the correct direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and firmly serve proletarian politics.
    In the upsurge of the vigorous development of the socialist cultural revolution in our country, the performance of the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" in the capital has set a very good example for revolutionary literature and art. It is an achievement gained by resolutely implementing Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, a new flower that has grown up by correctly implementing the Party's literary and artistic policy, and another victory of the socialist cultural revolution. It further proves the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible and all-conquering; proving that in the literary and artistic field, as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic line, and adhere to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the proletarian literary and artistic ranks will have no fortress they cannot conquer, no position they cannot occupy.
    During its performance in the capital, the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" attracted a large audience of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously praised "The White-Haired Girl." This fact powerfully refutes the reactionary fallacies of all kinds of conservatives. It proves that foreign classical art forms can be completely transformed according to the principles of "making foreign things serve China" and "making the past serve the present" to serve our socialist cause. Chairman Mao said: "We do not refuse to make use of the literary and artistic forms of past ages, but these old forms, in our hands, are transformed, and imbued with new content, and become revolutionary things serving the people." The artistic practice of "The White-Haired Girl" proves the undeniable truth of this Marxist-Leninist thesis.

          Highlighted the Idea of Class Struggle
    The revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a re-creation based on the opera "The White-Haired Girl." However, it has made considerable improvements and enhancements in ideological content, achieving great success. The opera "The White-Haired Girl" was a product of the democratic revolution period in our country, subject to certain limitations of the era. In socialist today, the key question is whether the re-creation based on the original opera can break through its original limitations, whether it can infuse the spirit of the socialist era, so as to further deepen and enhance its theme and meet the current requirements of the times, and play a greater role in inspiring and educating the people. In their creative practice, the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance seized this core issue, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighted politics, and highlighted class struggle, thereby greatly improving the political quality of this work.
    Chairman Mao taught us: Where there is oppression, there is resistance and struggle. Chairman Mao also taught us: The history of human civilization for thousands of years is a history of class struggle. The opera "The White-Haired Girl" reflects these views of Chairman Mao to a certain extent. However, due to the limitations of the times, and the limitations of the class consciousness and ideological level of the original author, the reflection is not profound enough. The comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance used Chairman Mao's theories to re-analyze this subject matter; re-recognized the class struggle and class relations in our country's rural areas during the period of the democratic revolution, thereby further embodying Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle in their creation, and more deeply and accurately reflecting the situation of class struggle in our country's rural areas at that time, improving the ideology of this work.
    The directing comrades of the ballet added a prologue to the whole play, which is by no means an insignificant stroke, and is not merely out of the need for the traditional formal structure of the ballet. This prologue not only explains the historical background at that time, but also clearly outlines the social outline for us. In the prologue, groups of poor peasants, under the supervision of the landlord's lackeys, are forced to send the grain they have earned with their blood and sweat into the landlord's granary. From their eyes and emotions, we see the deep hatred of the oppressed and exploited peasants for the landlord class, see their unyielding spirit, and see the class resistance force accumulated in their hearts. It foretells that in a very short period of time, a revolutionary struggle movement, like a violent storm, will inevitably arrive. It also clearly reveals to the audience that the Yang Bailao family's misfortune is not the misfortune of an individual peasant family, but the common destiny of hundreds of millions of poor peasants in our country under the cruel oppression of the feudal system in the old society. Next, the ballet focuses on depicting Yang Bailao's rising up to resist the evil landlord; depicting Xi'er's strength and unyielding spirit in the face of Huang Shiren and Huang's mother's bullying; depicting underground Party member Zhao Dashu guiding Wang Dachun to join the Eighth Route Army and embark on the correct path for the oppressed class to seek its own liberation; depicting how, under the extremely heavy feudal exploitation, the peasants of our country, once they had the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately rose up and acted, throwing themselves into the heated struggle of rent reduction and anti-hegemony; and finally depicting how the awakened people took up arms and joined the ranks of armed struggle in order to achieve complete liberation. Through this series of plot descriptions, the directing comrades of the ballet clearly and distinctly ran a red line of class struggle throughout the entire play.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "War is the continuation of politics," "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to allow the people to gain political power." In the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance followed Chairman Mao's teachings and prominently reflected the idea of armed struggle. They not only vividly depicted the plot of the Eighth Route Army coming to Yanggezhuang to arm the masses and carry out struggle in the fifth act of the ballet, but also added a very combative epilogue. Xi'er, who had just been rescued from the deep mountains and caves, immediately joined the Eighth Route Army and embarked on the battlefield of revolutionary armed struggle together with other liberated peasants after defeating the evil landlord. This epilogue is well added and extremely important.
    The bourgeois "authority" gentlemen in literary and art circles always ridicule our revolutionary literature and art as "slogans" or "labeling." This is their black talk, the manifestation of their class nature. The reason why they curse us as "slogans" and "labeling" is because they are very afraid that our literature and art will reflect the politics of the proletariat and serve the politics of the proletariat. Is the epilogue of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" a "slogan"? Is it "labeling"? No, absolutely not! This epilogue correctly reflects the inevitable path for the oppressed class to seek its own liberation, and also truthfully reflects the history of our people's revolutionary struggle. Xi'er's resolute action to join the armed struggle is precisely the inevitable development of her strong character, which has been tempered under the cruel oppression of the landlord class for a long time, and in the continuous struggle against oppression. The addition of this plot in the epilogue highlights the idea of armed struggle and more completely completes the character shaping of Xi'er.

      Successfully Reshaped the Image of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Striving to shape heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the fundamental task of socialist literature and art. The comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance followed Chairman Mao's teachings, used the method of class analysis, and, with the idea of ​​writing biographies for the poor and lower-middle peasants, made a completely new treatment of the representative figures of the oppressed class in the play, such as Xi'er, Yang Bailao, Wang Dachun, and Zhao Dashu. The image of these characters is shaped higher, more typical, and more ideal. This is another great achievement they have gained in this creative practice.
    The role of Xi'er is a character that runs through the whole play and is the main representative figure of the poor peasants in the whole play. In this work that reveals the darkness of the old society, praises the brightness of the new society, and reflects the class struggle in our country's rural areas during the period of the democratic revolution, it should reveal the heinous oppression and bone-sucking exploitation of the feudal evil landlord against the peasants through this role, and also reflect the resistance spirit and class qualities of the oppressed. The opera "The White-Haired Girl" has defects in shaping this character image. It unrealistically depicts Xi'er's gentle and submissive character, and overly depicts her misfortunes and humiliations. It was not until Xi'er endured and endured again, with no way out, that she showed her resistance. This lowers the spiritual outlook of this character, lowers her class qualities, and does not fully demonstrate the typical character of a typical figure of the oppressed class. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" reshaped the new Xi'er. The suffering of life did not wear away her rebellious character, and class oppression tempered her strong will. She has deep hatred for the evil landlord and is full of indignation and injustice towards the feudal society. The hatred and indignation accumulated in her heart can burst out the flame of struggle at any time. She dares to help her father resist the bullying of the evil landlord, and she has no servile demeanor when she is forced to work for the landlord. She fearlessly counterattacks every encroachment by the evil landlord. From her, we see the brilliance of the strong character of the vast oppressed peasants in our country.
    Yang Bailao's position in the whole play is second only to Xi'er. Yang Bailao in the opera "The White-Haired Girl" is a weak-character, timid person. He suffered from exploitation and oppression, and tasted the pain and bitterness. Although he was deeply resentful, he was subdued by the darkness of the old society. He finally ended his bitter life by committing suicide by poisoning. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" created another Yang Bailao. Deep suffering, cruel exploitation, and the darkness of the old society did not subdue him. He dares to resist, dare to struggle, dare to protect his own flesh and blood, and dare to resist the bullying of the oppressors. His blow to the landlord Huang Shiren with a carrying pole is a brave challenge to the old society and the old system. Although he was persecuted and lost his life, his character showed the never-yielding resistance spirit of the oppressed class.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has also developed the treatment of the roles of Zhao Dashu and Wang Dachun compared to the original opera "The White-Haired Girl." Their personalities are clearer and stronger. In particular, allowing Zhao Dashu to appear as an underground Party member not only highlights this character, but also more accurately reflects the real life of class struggle in rural areas at that time.
    In their creative practice, the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance adhered to the creative method of combining revolutionary realism with revolutionary romanticism, and reshaped the main characters in the play, washing away the filth and dirt that the feudal ruling class has imposed on the poor peasants in our country for thousands of years; the class qualities of the oppressed who are not afraid of the powerful, not afraid of the powerful, dare to resist, and dare to struggle are gloriously displayed.
    The revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has achieved gratifying achievements both in the deepening of the theme of the work and in the shaping of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is precisely the inevitable result of the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting proletarian politics, and highlighting class struggle in their creative practice.

          Made Ballet Art Gain New Life
    Chairman Mao taught us that the culture of imperialism and the feudal class should be overthrown. "If this kind of thing is not overthrown, no new culture can be established. No destruction, no construction; no blockage, no flow; no stopping, no progress. The struggle between them is a life-and-death struggle." This is the law of development of objective things, and also the law of class struggle. In the current socialist cultural revolution, in the field of literature and art, whether or not to dare to break the bourgeois and feudal literary and artistic thoughts and art forms, to mark the new of socialism and establish the difference of the proletariat, has become the key issue to whether to win the victory of the struggle.
    Ballet art is a foreign classical art form. For many years, bourgeois "experts" have regarded it as the "highest artistic peak" and as a "sacred and inviolable sacred object." They believe that its artistic laws cannot be touched, and its inherent forms cannot be changed, otherwise it will destroy the integrity of its form and the unity of art, and it will no longer be a ballet. How should revolutionary dance workers treat this issue? Is it to move it to the socialist stage intact, so that it continues to promote bourgeois ideology to poison the people, and destroy the socialist revolution and socialist construction from the ideological field? Or is it to thoroughly transform it, so that it can become a tool for serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, for serving proletarian politics, and for serving the socialist economic base? This is a sharp class struggle on the dance art front. In this struggle, our country's revolutionary dance workers were not intimidated by the reactionary arguments of these bourgeois "experts." They took a clear-cut stand and firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, and bravely launched an attack on this stubborn artistic fortress! Let the working people replace the foreign talents and foreign beauties, and become the protagonists on the socialist ballet stage. Replacing the bourgeois love affair with the revolutionary and fighting life of the workers, peasants, and soldiers has become the new content of the revolutionary ballet. And starting from reflecting these brand-new contents, the old forms and old techniques of ballet were fundamentally transformed, new forms and new techniques were created, and this art was given new life. Since then, in our country, ballet has truly become the artistic treasure of the people.
    This is a great revolution. The birth of revolutionary modern ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" is the victorious result of this great revolution.
    Bourgeois ballet "experts" are afraid and annoyed when they see revolutionary ballets. They will rant: "You are fooling around, you are blaspheming sacred objects, destroying all the laws, and it is not a ballet at all!" Revolutionary dance workers responded loudly to these "experts" through their creations: "Gentlemen, you are right, we are going to break your laws. If we don't break your bourgeois ballet art system, our proletarian ballet cannot be established. We don't need your approval. We serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we serve proletarian politics, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have approved us and support us in doing so. It is unanimously reflected that revolutionary ballet is good, we can understand such ballet, up and down the stage, it is the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the voice of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it speaks for us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is to the taste of our workers, peasants, and soldiers." Although the revolutionary ballet has only just taken its first step, its abundant proletarian vitality and its deep artistic power to serve proletarian politics are fundamentally incomparable to bourgeois ballet. Bourgeois "expert" gentlemen! You can only curse, those things you regard as treasures can only be thrown into the garbage heap of history.
    The success of the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is the result of our country's revolutionary dance workers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and making a big revolution in ballet. They also vividly prove that Chairman Mao's point of view of "no destruction, no construction" is the truth. However, at this time, some people insisted on putting forward the fallacy of "without construction, it is impossible to achieve truly thorough destruction" to sing the opposite tune to Mao Zedong Thought. May I ask, if the proletariat does not crush the state machine of the bourgeois dictatorship, how can it establish the state of the proletarian dictatorship? If the proletariat does not overthrow the capitalist social system, how can it build a socialist society? If the proletariat does not smash the old world to pieces, how can it create a new world? Similarly, in the field of culture and art, if the proletariat does not thoroughly criticize and transform the bourgeois and feudal literature and art, it will be impossible to establish its own literature and art. The revolutionary modern plays of Peking Opera are precisely the excellent plays such as "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment" that have been created by clearing away the reactionary content of the old Peking Opera, breaking its inherent forms, and abandoning its stale techniques. It is precisely because the symphonic music "Shajiabang" broke the foreign frames created by bourgeois musicians that the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers occupied the symphonic music position for the first time in history. The clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" is also precisely because the revolutionary art workers crushed the "formal beauty" of bourgeois sculpture art, overturned the "lotus seat" of feudal superstitious sculpture art, and did what no predecessors had done or could have done, and used sculpture art to vividly express class struggle. All these facts prove the incomparable correctness of Chairman Mao's thesis of "no destruction, no construction" and thoroughly shatter the fallacy of "without construction, it is impossible to achieve truly thorough destruction."
    The different views and different attitudes held on the relationship between "destruction" and "construction" are the reflections of the world outlook of two different classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Only the most advanced proletariat can truly understand the objective truth of the development of things "no destruction, no construction" with a materialistic world outlook. The intentions of those who shout "without construction, it is impossible to achieve truly thorough destruction" are very obvious. To put it bluntly, they just don't allow breaking the bourgeois things, and don't allow establishing the proletarian things. In the current high tide of the socialist cultural revolution, their shouting of this slogan can only show that they are serving the dying bourgeoisie, and can only show that they are the vanguards of the unwilling bourgeoisie. We must never be disturbed by them. We must adhere to Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the point of view of "no destruction, no construction," learn from the spirit of the directing comrades of the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" to make a big revolution in ballet, and bravely attack everything that is bourgeois, revisionist, and feudal decaying in the field of literature and art. Break all the shackles that bind us, all the rules and regulations. For the needs of our class, mark the new of socialism, establish the difference of the proletariat, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.
    The performance of the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" in the capital is coming to an end. We sincerely congratulate the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance for the success they have achieved, and sincerely thank them for their great contribution to the socialist cultural revolution.
                        (Originally published in the "People's Liberation Army Daily" on June 10) (Attached picture)
    Thousands of years of hatred must be avenged, and tens of thousands of years of grievances must be extended. The masses have risen up one after another to accuse and severely punish the traitorous evil landlord Huang Shiren.
    The liberated peasants sing: Millions of workers and peasants rise up together, the smoke and dust roll in, how many Xi'ers have turned over, and the beautiful rivers and mountains will always shine!

### 文化大革命中的一朵香花——祝贺革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》演出成功

    文化大革命中的一朵香花
    ——祝贺革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》演出成功
    丁毅
    编者按：在当前无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，毛泽东文艺思想培育下开放的一朵香花——革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，在首都演出以来，获得了广大观众的热烈赞扬。
    今天本报转载的丁毅同志写的这篇文章，通过对《白毛女》的高度评价，有力地驳斥了文艺界的资产阶级“权威”老爷们的黑话。这些老爷们竭力诬蔑我们的革命文艺谈“阶级性太多了”，是“阶级标签主义”。他们以此为借口，公开反对毛泽东文艺思想，妄图使我们的革命文艺忘掉阶级斗争，不为工农兵服务，不为无产阶级政治服务，而去为资产阶级政治服务，蜕化为现代修正主义文艺，为资本主义复辟扫清道路。
    在这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者，一定要彻底批判文艺界反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。这些老爷们说“阶级性太多了”，我们就一定要阶级性多，要无产阶级的阶级性多，阶级性越多，越能巩固无产阶级专政，越能堵死资本主义复辟的道路。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，在革命的文艺战线上，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的正确方向，坚定地为无产阶级政治服务。
    在我国社会主义文化大革命蓬勃开展的高潮中，革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在首都的演出，为革命的文艺树立了一个很好的样板。它是坚决贯彻毛泽东文艺路线所获得的成果，它是正确执行党的文艺方针而成长起来的新花，它是社会主义文化大革命的又一胜利。它进一步证明了毛泽东思想战无不胜、攻无不克的巨大威力；证明了在文艺领域里，只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻党的文艺路线，坚持毛泽东文艺思想，无产阶级的文艺队伍就没有攻克不下的堡垒，攻占不了的阵地。
    舞剧《白毛女》在首都演出期间，吸引了广大工农兵观众。工农兵齐声赞扬《白毛女》。这一事实，有力地回击了形形色色的保守派的反动谬论。证明了外来的古典的艺术形式完全可以根据“外为中用”“古为今用”的原则加以改造，来为我们的社会主义事业服务。毛主席说过：“对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了。”《白毛女》的艺术实践，证明了这一马克思列宁主义论断的无可争辩的真理性。
          突出了阶级斗争的思想
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是根据歌剧《白毛女》进行再创造的。但是，它在思想内容上作了相当大的改进和提高，获得了巨大的成功。歌剧《白毛女》是我国民主革命时期的产物，它受着一定时代的局限。在社会主义的今天，根据原歌剧进行再创造，能否突破它原有的局限性；能否贯注以社会主义的时代精神，就成为能否进一步深化提高它的主题思想，满足当前的时代要求，对人民群众起到更大的鼓舞和教育作用的关键问题了。上海市舞蹈学校的同志们在创作实践中抓住了这一核心问题，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，突出阶级斗争，从而大大地提高了这一作品的政治质量。
    毛主席教导我们：哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，有斗争。毛主席又教导我们：人类几千年的文明史就是一部阶级斗争的历史。歌剧《白毛女》在一定程度上反映了毛主席的这些观点。但由于时代的限制，由于原作者阶级觉悟、思想水平的限制，反映得很不深刻。上海市舞蹈学校的同志们运用毛主席的学说，重新分析了这一题材；重新认识了民主革命时期我国农村中的阶级斗争、阶级关系，从而在他们的创作中，更深一步地体现了毛主席阶级和阶级斗争的观点，更深刻更准确地反映了当时我国农村的阶级斗争的情况，提高了这一作品的思想性。
    舞剧的编导同志在全剧之前加了一个序幕，这绝不是无关轻重的一笔，更不只是出自舞剧传统形式结构的需要。这个序幕不仅交代了当时的历史背景，并且为我们清楚地勾划出当时的社会轮廓。序幕中，一群群贫苦农民在地主狗腿子的监视下，被迫把自己血汗换来的粮食送进地主的粮仓。从他们的眼神里，情绪里，我们看到被压迫被剥削的农民对地主阶级的深刻仇恨，看到了他们不屈的精神，看到了他们内心中郁积着的阶级反抗力量。它预示着：在很短期间内，一场势如暴风骤雨，异常迅猛的革命斗争运动势必到来。它也向观众清楚地揭示了杨白劳一家的遭遇并不是个别农家的厄运，而是在旧社会，在封建制度残酷压迫下，我国亿万贫苦农民共同的命运。接着，舞剧着重地描绘了杨白劳对恶霸地主的奋起反击；描写了喜儿在黄世仁、黄母的欺凌面前坚强不屈；描写了地下党员赵大叔指引王大春投奔八路军，走上被压迫阶级谋求自身解放的正确道路；描写了在无比惨重的封建压榨下的我国农民一旦得到了中国共产党的领导，就立即奋起，行动起来，投身于减租反霸的火热斗争；最后又描写出觉悟了的人民拿起武器，为求得彻底解放，加入了武装斗争的行列。通过这一系列的情节描绘，舞剧的编导同志把一条阶级斗争的红线，鲜明清楚地贯穿于全剧之中。
    毛主席教导我们：“战争是政治的继续”，“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权”。上海市舞蹈学校的同志们在舞剧《白毛女》的创作中，遵照了毛主席的教导，突出地反映了武装斗争的思想。他们不仅在舞剧第五场中生动地描绘了八路军来到杨各庄后，武装群众、开展斗争的情节，并且增加了一个非常战斗化的尾声。刚刚从深山野洞中被救出来的喜儿，在斗垮了恶霸地主之后，立即同其他翻身农民一起，拿起武器，参加八路军，走上革命武装斗争的战场。这个尾声加得好，加得异常重要。
    文艺界的资产阶级“权威”老爷们总是讥讽我们革命的文艺是什么“标语口号”，什么“贴标签”。这是他们的黑话，是他们阶级本性的表现。他们所以咒骂我们是“标语口号”“贴标签”，因为他们十分害怕我们的文艺反映无产阶级的政治，为无产阶级的政治服务。舞剧《白毛女》这个尾声是“标语口号”吗？是“贴标签”吗？不，绝不是！这个尾声正确地反映了被压迫阶级谋求自身解放的必经之途，也真实地反映了我国人民革命斗争的历史。喜儿毅然参加武装斗争的行动，正是她长期在地主阶级的残酷压榨下，在不断地反抗压迫的斗争中，磨炼出来的坚强性格的必然发展。尾声增加的这一情节突出了武装斗争的思想，也更圆满地完成了喜儿的性格塑造。
      成功地重新塑造了贫下中农形象
    努力塑造工农兵的英雄人物，是社会主义文艺的根本任务。上海市舞蹈学校的同志们遵循毛主席的教导，运用阶级分析的方法，本着为贫下中农立传的思想，对剧中被压迫阶级的代表人物喜儿、杨白劳、王大春、赵大叔等，成功地作了全新的处理。把这些人物的形象塑造得更高，更典型，更理想。这是他们在这次创作实践中获得的另一巨大成就。
    喜儿这一角色是贯穿全剧的人物，是全剧中贫苦农民的主要代表人物。在这一揭露旧社会的黑暗，歌颂新社会的光明，反映民主革命时期我国农村阶级斗争的作品中，应该通过这一角色，揭示出封建恶霸地主对农民的穷凶极恶的压迫，敲骨吸髓的剥削，又反映出被压迫者的反抗精神和阶级品质。歌剧《白毛女》对这一人物形象的塑造是有缺陷的。它不真实地描写了喜儿性格的柔顺和屈从，过多地描写了她所遭遇的不幸和屈辱。直到喜儿一忍再忍，毫无退路的时候，才表现了她的反抗。这就降低了这一人物的精神面貌，降低了她的阶级品质，没有充分展示一个被压迫阶级的典型人物的典型性格。舞剧《白毛女》重新塑造了新的喜儿。生活的苦难没有磨损她反抗的性格，阶级压迫更锻炼了她坚强的意志。她对恶霸地主怀有深仇大恨，对封建社会充满愤懑不平。郁积在她心里的仇恨和愤懑，随时都能迸发出斗争的火焰。她敢于帮助父亲反抗恶霸的欺凌，她被迫替地主干活也毫无半点奴颜婢膝。对恶霸地主的每一次进逼，她都毫无畏惧地给以反击。从她身上，我们看到了我国广大被压迫农民的坚强性格的光辉。
    杨白劳在全剧中所居的地位仅次于喜儿。歌剧《白毛女》里的杨白劳是一个性格软弱，胆小怕事的人。他受尽了剥削欺压，尝尽了痛苦辛酸，虽然苦大仇深，但却被旧社会的黑暗压服了。他终于以服毒自杀，结束了自己悲苦的一生。舞剧《白毛女》创造了另一个杨白劳。深重的苦难，残酷的剥削，旧社会的黑暗都没有把他压服。他敢于反抗，敢于斗争，敢于保护自己的亲生骨肉，敢于抵抗压迫者的欺凌。他举起扁担向地主黄世仁的一击，正是向旧社会旧制度勇敢的挑战。虽然他被迫害丢掉了生命，但从他的性格中显示出了被压迫阶级永不屈服的反抗精神。
    舞剧《白毛女》对赵大叔、王大春这两个角色的处理比歌剧《白毛女》原作也有发展。他们的性格更明朗，更坚强了。特别是让赵大叔以地下党员的身份出现，不但突出了这一人物，也更准确地反映了当时农村阶级斗争的生活真实。
    上海市舞蹈学校的同志们在创作实践中，坚持了革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，对剧中主要人物进行的重新塑造，把几千年来封建统治阶级强加在我国贫苦农民身上的污秽、泥垢冲洗得干干净净；把被压迫者不畏强暴，不惧权势，敢于反抗，敢于斗争的阶级品质光辉地显示出来。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，无论在作品主题的深化上，或是在工农兵英雄人物的塑造上都获得了可喜成就。这正是上海市舞蹈学校的同志们在创作实践中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，突出阶级斗争的必然成果。
          使芭蕾艺术获得了新生
    毛主席教导我们，帝国主义和封建阶级的文化应该被打倒，“不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”这是客观事物的发展规律，也是阶级斗争的规律。在当前社会主义文化大革命中，在文艺领域里，敢不敢破资产阶级、封建主义的文艺思想和艺术形式，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，就成为能否取得斗争胜利的关键问题。
    芭蕾艺术是外来的古典艺术形式。多少年来，资产阶级的“专家”们把它奉为“至高无上的艺术顶峰”，把它奉为“神圣不可侵犯的圣物”。认为它的艺术规律不容触动，它的固有形式不容更改，否则就破坏了它形式的完整，艺术的统一，不成其为芭蕾舞剧了。革命的舞蹈工作者如何对待这一问题？是把它原封不动地搬上社会主义舞台，让它继续宣扬资产阶级思想来毒害人民，从意识形态领域里来破坏社会主义革命、社会主义建设呢？还是把它彻底改造，使它成为为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，为社会主义经济基础服务的工具呢？这是摆在舞蹈艺术战线上的一场尖锐的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，我国革命的舞蹈工作者没有被这些资产阶级“专家”们的反动论调吓倒。他们旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，坚决遵循毛主席的教导，勇敢地向这一顽固的艺术堡垒展开了进攻！让劳动人民代替了洋才子、洋佳人，成为社会主义芭蕾舞台上的主人公。用工农兵的革命的战斗的生活代替了资产阶级的谈情说爱，成为革命芭蕾舞剧的全新内容。并且从反映这些崭新的内容出发，从根本上改造了芭蕾舞的旧形式、旧技巧，创造了新形式、新技巧，使这一艺术获得了新的生命。从此，在我国，芭蕾舞剧才真正成为人民自己的艺术财富。
    这是一场大革命。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》《白毛女》的诞生，就是这场大革命的胜利果实。
    资产阶级芭蕾舞“专家”们看了革命芭蕾舞剧，他们害怕，他们恼火。他们会胡说：“你们这是胡闹，这是亵渎圣物，破坏了一切规律，根本不成其为芭蕾舞剧！”革命的舞蹈工作者通过他们的创作，响亮地回答了这些“专家”：“先生们，你们说对了，我们就是要破掉你们那些规律。不破掉你们资产阶级芭蕾舞的艺术体系，我们无产阶级的芭蕾舞就建立不起来。我们不需要你们批准。我们是为工农兵服务的，是为无产阶级政治服务的，广大工农兵批准了我们，拥护我们这么办。一致反映，革命芭蕾舞剧就是好，这样的芭蕾舞剧我们看得懂，舞台上下，是工农兵的形象，工农兵的声音，工农兵的感情，为我们工农兵说了话，对我们工农兵的口味。”革命芭蕾舞剧虽然才仅仅迈开了第一步，但它所具有的无产阶级充沛的生命力，它为无产阶级政治服务的深厚的艺术力量，是资产阶级芭蕾舞剧根本不能与之相比的。资产阶级的“专家”先生们！你们只管咒骂吧，你们奉为至宝的那些东西只能被丢进历史的垃圾堆。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的成功，是我国革命的舞蹈工作者活学活用毛主席著作，破除迷信，解放思想，大闹芭蕾舞革命的成果。它们又生动地证明了毛主席“不破不立”观点是真理。可是，就在这时候，却有人偏偏提出什么“没有立，就不可能达到真正彻底的破”的谬论，来跟毛泽东思想唱反调。试问，无产阶级如不粉碎资产阶级专政的国家机器，如何能建立起无产阶级专政的国家？无产阶级如不推翻资本主义的社会制度，从何建设社会主义社会？无产阶级如不把旧世界打个落花流水，又怎能创造一个新世界？同样，在文化艺术领域里，无产阶级如不对资产阶级、封建主义的文艺进行彻底的批判、改造，也就无从建立自己的文艺。京剧革命现代戏正是清除了旧京剧的反动内容，打破了它固有的形式，扬弃了它陈腐的技巧，才创造出《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》等优秀剧目。交响音乐《沙家浜》正是打破了资产阶级音乐家所制造的那些洋框框，才破天荒第一次让工农兵的思想感情，工农兵的英雄人物占领了交响乐阵地。泥塑《收租院》也正是革命的美术工作者打垮了资产阶级雕塑艺术的“形式美”，掀翻了封建迷信雕塑艺术的“莲花座”，做了前人所未做，也不可能做的事情，用雕塑艺术活生生地表现了阶级斗争。这一切事实都证明了毛主席“不破不立”的论断的无比正确，彻底粉碎了“没有立，就不能达到真正彻底的破”的谬论。
    对“破”和“立”的关系，所持的不同观点，不同态度，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个不同阶级的世界观的反映。只有最先进的无产阶级，才能以唯物主义的世界观真正认识“不破不立”这一事物发展的客观真理。喊叫“没有立，就不能达到真正彻底的破”的人，他们的用心是很明显的。说穿了，他们就是不准破资产阶级的东西，不准立无产阶级的东西。在当前社会主义文化大革命的高潮中，他们喊出这一口号，只能说明他们是为垂死挣扎的资产阶级服务，只能说明他们是不甘死亡的资产阶级的马前卒。我们绝不能受他们的干扰，我们必须坚持毛泽东思想，坚持“不破不立”的观点，学习革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的编导同志们大闹芭蕾舞革命的精神，在文艺领域里，勇猛地向一切资产阶级、修正主义、封建主义腐朽没落的东西进攻。破除一切束缚我们的条条、框框，一切清规戒律。为了我们阶级的需要，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在首都的演出即将结束了。我们衷心祝贺上海市舞蹈学校的同志们所获得的成功，衷心感谢他们对社会主义文化大革命作出的巨大贡献。
