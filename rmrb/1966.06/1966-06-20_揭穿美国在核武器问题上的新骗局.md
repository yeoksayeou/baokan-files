    Exposing the New American Swindle on Nuclear Weapons
　　Observer

    On May 9th, our country successfully conducted its third nuclear test. The next day, Premier Zhou Enlai, at the farewell banquet held by Comrade Shehu, once again clarified China's consistent position on the issue of nuclear weapons and pointed out that China had suggested to the United States that both sides undertake obligations not to be the first to use nuclear weapons, but American imperialism had rejected China's proposal. The success of our country's third nuclear test and Premier Zhou Enlai's speech dealt another heavy blow to American imperialism, causing a great uproar in the United States and placing the US government in a very passive position.

    Under these circumstances, the US government proposed in the Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks on May 25th the following suggestion: whether China's draft agreement on not being the first to use nuclear weapons could be considered in connection with the US-British-Soviet partial nuclear test ban treaty. Subsequently, on June 3rd, the US government revealed the content of this suggestion through The New York Times, saying that "if China is willing to agree to stop its atomic weapons tests, the United States would agree not to be the first to use nuclear weapons."

    This card played by the US government is another big swindle it is playing on the issue of nuclear weapons.

    As early as October 16, 1964, the same day as our country's first nuclear test, the Chinese government proposed convening a summit conference of world leaders to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and to take the guarantee not to use nuclear weapons as the first step towards the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. The Chinese government has taken the lead in announcing that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any circumstances. The Chinese government has also proposed to the United States that China and the United States first reach an agreement on the issue of guaranteeing not to use nuclear weapons before the summit conference of world leaders is held. However, the US government has consistently refused. Now, the US government suddenly indicates that it can "consider" an agreement on not being the first to use nuclear weapons. Does this indicate that it has changed its past position? No, absolutely not.

    What the US government says about considering not being the first to use nuclear weapons is false; its real intention is to trap China into the tripartite partial nuclear test ban treaty.

    What is the tripartite partial nuclear test ban treaty? It is a heinous act by the US and Soviet nuclear hegemons to consolidate their nuclear monopoly, bind the hands and feet of all peace-loving countries, and deceive the people of the world. It is a great betrayal by the Soviet leadership of the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the world. The Chinese government was the first and most resolute in opposing this treaty. We will not participate in this treaty at any time or under any circumstances. China's solemn position is known to the world and is clearly understood by the US government.

    So why does the US government now put forward such an absurd suggestion and widely publicize it in the world? The reason is very simple. The rapid development of China's nuclear weapons has greatly exceeded the expectations of the United States, accelerating the bankruptcy of its nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail policy. Therefore, the US government came up with this scheme: using the bait that the United States can "consider" not being the first to use nuclear weapons to trick China into accepting the tripartite treaty, restricting China's development of nuclear weapons, while the United States can still continue to engage in nuclear weapons in a big way, to save its nuclear monopoly. If China does not fall into its trap, it can righteously refuse to undertake the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and shift the responsibility to China.

    The US government is complacent, thinking that it can get rid of its passive situation with such a trick. In fact, this trick is very clumsy and can be seen through at a glance by anyone with a little common sense. China's proposal on mutual non-use of nuclear weapons is a practical step that helps eliminate the threat of nuclear war and move towards the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The tripartite treaty, however, is a serious step that legalizes the US development of nuclear weapons and the implementation of its nuclear blackmail policy, aggravating the threat of nuclear war. How can these two mutually exclusive and completely unrelated things be mentioned in the same breath, how can they be "linked"? The US government deliberately puts the two together, in fact, to ask us to abandon our principles and make a deal with the United States. This is absolutely impossible. The Chinese government will never do such a thing. If we agree to do so, it would be tantamount to betraying the people of the world, selling out the people of the world, and helping the United States consolidate its nuclear monopoly and implement its nuclear blackmail policy. Wouldn't we be no different from the Khrushchev revisionists? Wouldn't we become sinners in history?

    The US government's proposal in the Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks to consider linking China's proposal on not being the first to use nuclear weapons with the tripartite partial nuclear test ban treaty, and deliberately revealing it and publicizing it, is also aimed at trapping China into so-called disarmament negotiations. As early as 1965, when the 20th UN General Assembly passed a resolution to convene a world disarmament conference, the US and Soviet representatives sang in chorus at the meeting, one saying that absorbing China to participate in the meeting was "possible," and the other saying that China's participation in the meeting was "very necessary." Recently, on the same day that The New York Times revealed the content of the Sino-US ambassadorial-level talks, US State Department spokesman McCloskey also said: "We are certainly always interested in whether there are any indications that the Chinese Communists may be genuinely interested in practical disarmament arrangements." All of these are for the purpose of probing. However, we want to tell the United States straightforwardly that all your efforts are in vain.

    We have long seen through what the so-called disarmament of US imperialism is all about. What it calls disarmament is actually arms expansion. What it calls complete disarmament is actually complete arms expansion. The United States has been using the rhetoric of "disarmament" as a cover to deceive world public opinion and conceal its implementation of comprehensive arms expansion and war preparations. More than a thousand disarmament conferences have been held since the war, but the military equipment of US imperialism has not only not decreased but has greatly increased. US military spending has increased from $14.3 billion in 1947 to approximately $60 billion this year, and the armed forces have increased from 1.58 million in 1947 to more than 3 million this year. The United States also has more than 2,000 military bases and facilities abroad, with more than one million troops stationed there. This is an unadulterated and thorough arms expansion, with no shadow of disarmament at all.

    The most acute issue in the current international situation is the Vietnam issue, not any disarmament issue. US imperialism is stepping up its aggression against Vietnam and threatening to expand the war to the entire Indochina and China. Under these circumstances, how can we talk about disarmament? How can we sit down with US imperialism to discuss disarmament issues? If we do so, not only will it have no practical significance, but it will also shift the struggle goals of the people of the world, making it easier for US imperialism to wantonly expand its war of aggression. Therefore, whether it is within the United Nations or outside the United Nations, China will never participate in any world disarmament conference.

    The issue of disarmament has always been a topic for political transactions between Soviet modern revisionists and US imperialism. After signing the traitorous tripartite treaty, the Soviet Union has been stepping up its collusion with the United States on the so-called issue of preventing nuclear proliferation. Just as the United States was expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, the Soviet Union responded to the US request and resumed the Geneva Disarmament Conference in July last year, which had been interrupted for ten months. The Soviet representative openly said, "We do not want to make our discussions dependent on Vietnam (issue)," and even said that it was precisely because the US aggression against Vietnam had greatly aggravated the international situation that it was "necessary to make the greatest efforts" to make progress in the Geneva Disarmament Conference. The reason why the Soviet leaders are so eager to finalize the "prevention of nuclear proliferation" issue is that they are eager to maintain the hegemony of the two nuclear powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, through this treaty, so that the United States and the Soviet Union can cooperate to dominate the world, while creating the false impression of easing the international situation, paralyzing and relaxing the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against US imperialism. This once again exposed the reactionary face of the Soviet leaders acting as accomplices of US imperialism and promoting the line of Soviet-US cooperation to dominate the world.

    What tripartite treaty, what world disarmament conference, what prevention of nuclear proliferation, what linking China's draft agreement on not being the first to use nuclear weapons with the tripartite partial nuclear test ban treaty, all of these are aimed at restricting and depriving China and all peace-loving countries of their legitimate right to develop self-defense armed forces, and restricting and depriving them of their right to possess and develop nuclear weapons. In a word, it is only allowed for the United States to comprehensively expand its arms, and not allowed for the peace-loving countries of the world, especially the Asian and African countries, to have self-defense armed forces; only the United States and the Soviet Union are allowed to have nuclear weapons, and other countries are not allowed to have nuclear weapons. However, this is absolutely impossible. The success of China's three nuclear tests has shattered the wishful thinking of the United States and its accomplices, and has given tremendous encouragement to the peace-loving countries and people of the world. Under these circumstances, the US attempt to play new tricks on the issue of nuclear weapons is doomed to bankruptcy.

    The Chinese government has always advocated the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China conducts nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons in order to resist the nuclear threat of the United States, break the nuclear monopoly of the United States, and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons. As long as the United States possesses nuclear weapons for one day, China must continue to develop nuclear weapons and never relax its vigilance. The various tricks of the United States on the issue of nuclear weapons can have no other result than to expose itself.

    揭穿美国在核武器问题上的新骗局
　　观察家
    五月九日，我国成功地进行了第三次核试验。第二天，周恩来总理在谢胡同志举行的告别宴会上，再一次阐明了中国在核武器问题上的一贯立场，并且指出，中国曾经向美国建议，彼此承担义务，相互不首先使用核武器，但是美帝国主义拒绝了中国的建议。我国第三次核试验的成功和周恩来总理的这次讲话，给美帝国主义又一个沉重的打击，在美国引起轩然大波，使美国政府陷于十分被动的境地。
    在这种情况下，美国政府于五月二十五日的中美大使级会谈中提出这样一个建议：是否可以把中国关于不首先使用核武器的协议草案同美英苏部分停止核试验条约联系起来考虑。接着，在六月三日，美国政府通过《纽约时报》透露了这个建议的内容，说“如果中国愿意答应停止它的原子武器试验，美国就同意不首先使用核武器”。
    美国政府打出的这一张牌，是它在核武器问题上玩弄的又一个大骗局。
    中国政府早在一九六四年十月十六日，即我国第一次核试验的同一天，就曾经建议召开世界各国首脑会议，讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器问题，而把保证不使用核武器作为全面禁止核武器的第一步。中国政府已经率先宣布，在任何时候、任何情况下，中国都不会首先使用核武器。中国政府还曾经向美国提出，在世界各国首脑会议举行之前，中国同美国先就保证不使用核武器问题达成协议。但是，美国政府始终不干。现在，美国政府忽然表示它可以“考虑”关于不首先使用核武器的协议。这是不是表明它改变了过去的立场呢？不，绝不。
    美国政府说什么要考虑不首先使用核武器，那是假的；它想把中国套进三国部分停止核试验条约，才是真的。
    三国部分停止核试验条约是个什么东西？它是美苏两个核霸王力图巩固它们的核垄断地位、束缚一切爱好和平国家的手脚、愚弄全世界人民的罪恶勾当，是苏共领导对苏联人民和全世界人民利益的大叛卖。中国政府是首先并且是最坚决地反对这个条约的。我们在任何时候、任何情况下都不会参加这个条约。中国这种严正立场是举世周知的，也是美国政府清楚明白的。
    那么美国政府为什么现在提出这样一个荒谬的建议，并且在世界上广为宣扬呢？理由很简单。中国核武器发展之快，大大超过了美国的预想，使它的核垄断地位和核讹诈政策加速破产。于是，美国政府就想出了这么一条计谋：用什么美国可以“考虑”不首先使用核武器作为诱饵，骗中国接受三国条约，限制中国发展核武器，而美国却仍然可以继续大搞特搞核武器，来挽救它的核垄断地位。如果中国不上它的圈套，它就可以振振有辞地拒绝承担不首先使用核武器的义务，并且把责任推到中国身上。
    美国政府自作聪明，以为用这样一个骗局就可以摆脱被动的处境。其实，这个骗局是十分笨拙的，是稍有常识的人一眼就可看穿的。中国关于相互不使用核武器的建议，是一个有助于消除核战争威胁，走向全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的切实步骤。而三国条约却是一个使美国发展核武器、推行核讹诈政策合法化，加重核战争威胁的严重步骤。这两个互相排斥、毫无共同之点的东西怎么能够相提并论，怎么能够“联系起来”呢？美国政府故意把两者扯在一起，实际上是要我们放弃原则，同美国达成交易。这是绝对办不到的。中国政府永远不会干这样的事。如果我们同意这样干，那就等于背叛全世界人民，出卖全世界人民，帮助美国巩固核垄断地位，帮助美国推行核讹诈政策。那我们岂不是同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者没有区别了吗？岂不是成了历史的罪人吗？
    美国政府在中美大使级会谈中提出把中国关于不首先使用核武器的建议同三国部分停止核试验条约联系起来考虑，并且故意透露出来，大肆渲染，其目的还在于，要把中国套进所谓裁军谈判中去。早在一九六五年第二十届联合国大会通过召开世界裁军会议的决议时，美苏两国代表就在会上一唱一和，一个说吸收中国与会是“可能”的，一个说中国与会是“非常必要”的。最近，在《纽约时报》透露中美大使级会谈内容的同一天，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基又说：“对于是否有任何迹象表明中国共产党人也许真正对切实可行的裁军安排感兴趣，我们当然是始终感兴趣的。”所有这些，都是为了进行试探。但是，我们要直截了当地告诉美国，你们这一切都是白费心机。
    美帝国主义的所谓裁军究竟是怎么一回事，我们老早就看透了。它所说的裁军，就是扩军。它所说的全面裁军，就是全面扩军。美国一直以侈谈“裁军”作幌子，欺骗世界舆论，掩盖它实行全面扩军备战。战后各种裁军会议开了一千多次，美帝国主义的军备不仅没有减少，反而大量增加。美国的军费从一九四七年的一百四十三亿美元增加到今年的大约六百亿美元，武装部队从一九四七年的一百五十八万人增加到今年的三百万人以上。美国还在国外拥有两千多个军事基地和军事设施，驻扎有一百多万军队。这是不折不扣的全面彻底扩军，根本没有一点裁军的影子。
    当前国际上最尖锐的问题是越南问题，而不是什么裁军问题。美帝国主义正在加紧侵略越南，并且威胁要把战火扩大到整个印度支那和中国。在这种情况下，怎么能谈得上什么裁军呢？怎么能同美帝国主义坐在一起讨论什么裁军问题呢？如果这样做，不仅没有实际意义，反而会转移世界人民的斗争目标，便于美帝国主义肆意扩大侵略战争。因此，不论是在联合国内或联合国外，召开什么世界裁军会议，中国都决不参加。
    裁军问题一直是苏联现代修正主义者同美帝国主义进行政治交易的一个题目。苏联在签订了叛卖性的三国条约之后，一直在同美国就所谓防止核扩散问题加紧勾结。正当美国扩大侵略越南战争的时候，苏联响应美国的要求，于去年七月间恢复了中断十个月之久的日内瓦裁军会议。苏联代表公然说，“不希望使我们的讨论取决于越南（问题）”，甚至说，正是由于美国对越南的侵略大大加剧了国际局势，才“必须尽最大努力”使日内瓦裁军会议取得进展。苏联领导人所以迫不及待地想就“防止核扩散”问题拍板成交，是急于企图通过这个条约来维持苏美两个核大国的霸权，以便美苏合作主宰世界，同时造成国际局势和缓的假象，麻痹和松懈世界革命人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。这又一次暴露了苏联领导人充当美帝国主义帮凶，推行苏美合作主宰世界路线的反动面目。
    什么三国条约，什么世界裁军会议，什么防止核扩散，什么把中国关于不首先使用核武器的协议草案与三国部分停止核试验条约联系在一起，所有这一切，都是为了限制和剥夺中国和一切爱好和平的国家发展自卫武装力量的正当权利，限制和剥夺它们拥有和发展核武器的权利。一句话，就是只许美国全面扩军，不许世界爱好和平国家、特别是亚非国家拥有自卫武装力量；只许美国和苏联有核武器，不许其它国家有核武器。但是，这是绝对办不到的。中国三次核试验的成功，把美国及其帮凶的如意算盘打得粉碎，给世界爱好和平的国家和人民以巨大的鼓舞。在这种情况下，美国还企图在核武器问题上玩弄新的骗局，更是注定要破产的。
    中国政府一贯主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器。中国进行核试验，发展核武器，是为了抵制美国的核威胁，打破美国的核垄断，最后消灭核武器。只要一天美国掌握着核武器，中国就一定要继续发展核武器，决不放松警惕。美国在核武器问题上的种种骗局，除了暴露它自己之外，不可能有别的结果。
