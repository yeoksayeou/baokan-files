    Good Canals Temper Good People, Both Spiritual and Material Harvests Achieved
    The Shaoshan Irrigation District's Main Canal and North Canal Completed and Open for Water Diversion
    This project is a school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Among the 100,000-strong labor force on the entire construction site, more than 600 joined the Party, over 10,000 young people joined the League, and over 40,000 were rated as "Five-Good" Mineworkers and Staff.
    Comrade Tao Zhu said at the water diversion ceremony that the construction of this project proves that the power of Mao Zedong Thought is unparalleled, the superiority of the socialist system is unparalleled, and the general line is completely correct. This is a powerful response to a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who attack and slander our socialist system and construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 2nd June - On June 2nd, people from four counties, Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Shuangfeng, and Xiangtan City held a grand rally to warmly celebrate the completion and water diversion of Hunan Province's first large-scale water diversion project - the Shaoshan Irrigation District's Main Canal and North Canal.
    Early in the morning, thousands of people's commune members, carrying colorful flags, beating gongs and drums, flocked to various gathering places in groups. The central venue near the Shaoshan Irrigation District's water diversion dam in Yangtan, Xiangxiang County, was crowded with people and filled with joy. On the hillsides on both sides, huge banners were erected with slogans such as "The completion of the Shaoshan Irrigation District project is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought" and "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participate in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution." A couplet was also pasted on the colorful archway: "Flying waves irrigate ten thousand hectares, wielding a pen to write a thousand canals."
    Tao Zhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and First Secretary of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made a special trip to participate in today's water diversion ceremony and delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: The Shaoshan Irrigation District project is also one of the major projects in the Central South region. This project will have a huge impact on the change of Hunan's agricultural landscape. It was created by the vast masses of people in Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Xiangxiang and other counties and cities, the people of the hometown of Chairman Mao and Chairman Liu, with heroic spirit and diligent hands in ten months, and is another brilliant achievement of Mao Zedong Thought. The construction of this project proves that the power of Mao Zedong Thought is unparalleled, the superiority of the socialist system is unparalleled, and the general line is completely correct. He said: Now, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, such as the Deng Tuo gang, attack and slander our socialist system and construction. Today, the completion and water diversion of the Shaoshan Irrigation District's Main Canal and North Canal is a powerful response to them. This proves that no force can stop us from moving forward. Mao Zedong Thought is great. If we read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, all problems can be solved and all difficulties can be overcome. He finally said: With water conservancy well built, we must achieve stable and high yields, and further realize agricultural mechanization in order to build large-scale socialist agriculture. We must better study Chairman Mao's works, better highlight politics, become more revolutionary, and continue to move forward.
    Also attending today's water diversion ceremony were Wang Shoudao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, Wang Yanchun, Second Secretary, Cheng Qian, Governor of Hunan Province, Tan Wenbang, Second Political Commissar of the Hunan Military Region, as well as the heads of the provincial, prefectural, and county committees. More than 600 representatives who participated in the Second Six-Good Units and Five-Good Individuals Representatives Conference of the Shaoshan Irrigation District project, which ended on the 1st, also attended the ceremony.
    The water diversion ceremony was presided over by Hua Guofeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC, Deputy Governor of Hunan Province, and Commander-in-Chief of the Shaoshan Irrigation District Project Headquarters, who also gave a report. Comrades Wang Shoudao, Zhang Pinghua, and Governor Cheng Qian spoke at the meeting, and Zheng Dagui, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works and a model "Five-Good" mineworker who participated in the construction of the project, also spoke.
    At 11 o'clock in the morning, after Comrade Tao Zhu cut the ribbon, the gate of the water inlet was slowly opened, and the Shaoshan Irrigation District officially started water diversion. Instantly, the滔滔漣河水飞淀出浪花 surged into the new canal. The crowds standing on both sides of the canal and on the surrounding hills cheered and jumped, applauding and shouting: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!
    The Shaoshan Irrigation District project was decided by the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Hunan Provincial People's Committee on June 28 last year and started construction on July 1. The entire project includes the Main Canal, the South Canal, and the North Canal. What has now been completed and opened for water diversion are the Main Canal and the North Canal. These two main canals pass through 70 mountains and cross more than 80 streams, rivers, and mountain gullies, totaling 174 kilometers in length, stretching across the triangular hilly areas of Xiangxiang, Xiangtan, and Ningxiang counties, benefiting 700,000 mu of farmland in these three counties (after the completion of the second phase of the South Canal, the benefited area can be increased to more than 1 million mu). During the construction of the project, a total of 15 million cubic meters of earth and stone were completed, approximately 85,000 cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete, seven tunnels with a total length of more than 2,800 meters were opened, and 19 aqueducts with a total length of more than 5,200 meters were erected. More than 1,700 small structures such as canal culverts, inverted siphons, diversion gates, and pedestrian bridges were built. The project was completed in just ten months, at the end of April this year. The canal has undergone two trial water tests for more than 30 days, and the situation is good.
    The Shaoshan Irrigation District canal can not only divert water for irrigation, but also develop shipping, flood prevention, and flood diversion, and can also develop aquaculture. It will play a great role in developing production in hilly areas.
    This construction project is a revolutionary melting pot, a school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, producing talents and experiences. Among the 100,000-strong labor force on the entire construction site, more than 600 joined the Communist Party of China at the construction site, more than 10,000 young people joined the Communist Youth League, 42,000 were rated as "Five-Good" mineworkers and staff, and more than 4,600 units were rated as "Six-Good" units. The goal of "good canals temper good people, both spiritual and material harvests achieved" has been reached.
    The victorious completion of the Shaoshan Irrigation District's Main Canal and North Canal is a great victory for the general line, and a great victory for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Practice has shown that revolutionary people, as long as they act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, can generate unlimited wisdom and power, and can continuously discover, invent, create, and advance in various undertakings!

    修好渠道炼好人　精神物质双丰收
    韶山灌区总干渠和北干渠竣工通水
    这项工程是一座活学活用毛主席著作的学校，全工地十万劳动大军中，六百多人入党，一万多青年入团，四万多人被评为“五好”民工、职工。
    陶铸同志在通水典礼上说，这项工程的兴建证明：毛泽东思想的威力是无比的，社会主义制度的优越性是无比的，总路线是完全正确的，这是对一小撮攻击和污蔑我们社会主义制度和建设的反党反社会主义分子的有力回击。
    新华社长沙二日电　六月二日，湘乡、湘潭、宁乡、双峰四县和湘潭市的人民举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝湖南省第一个大型引水工程——韶山灌区总干渠和北干渠竣工通水。
    大清早，成千上万的人民公社社员扛着彩旗，敲锣打鼓，成群结队地涌向各个集会地点。设在湘乡县洋潭的韶山灌区引水坝附近的中心会场，人山人海，一片欢腾。两旁山坡上，竖着“韶山灌区工程的建成是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利”、“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗积极参加社会主义文化大革命”等巨幅标语牌，彩门上还贴着一幅对联：“飞涟灌万顷，挥笔写千渠”。
    国务院副总理、中共中央中南局第一书记陶铸，专程前来参加了今天的通水典礼大会，并且在会上讲了话。他说：韶山灌区工程，在中南地区来讲，也是大工程之一。这项工程对湖南农业面貌的改变将发生巨大的影响，这是湘潭、宁乡、湘乡等县、市广大人民群众、毛主席和刘主席两位主席家乡的人民群众，用英雄的干劲，用勤劳的双手，在十个月的时间内创造出来的，是毛泽东思想又一次的辉煌成就。这项工程的兴建证明：毛泽东思想的威力是无比的，社会主义制度的优越性是无比的，总路线是完全正确的。他说：现在，一小撮反党反社会主义分子，如邓拓黑帮，攻击和污蔑我们的社会主义制度和建设，今天韶山灌区的总干渠、北干渠竣工通水就是给他们的有力的回击。这证明：什么力量也不能阻止我们前进。毛泽东思想是伟大的，我们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，一切问题都可以解决，一切困难都可以克服。他最后说：水利修好了，要稳产高产，要进一步实现农业机械化，才能建设社会主义大农业。我们必须更好地学习毛主席著作，更好地突出政治，更加革命化，继续前进。
    参加今天通水典礼大会的还有中共中央中南局书记处书记王首道、中共湖南省委第一书记张平化、第二书记王延春、湖南省省长程潜，湖南军区第二政治委员谭文邦以及省委、地委、县委负责人。参加一日结束的韶山灌区工程第二次六好单位五好个人代表会议的六百多名代表，也参加了典礼。
    通水典礼由中共湖南省委书记处书记、湖南省副省长、韶山灌区工程指挥部总指挥长华国锋主持并作了报告。王首道同志、张平化同志、程潜省长在会上讲了话，参加工程建设的学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好民工标兵郑达贵也讲了话。
    上午十一点，陶铸同志剪彩后，进水闸闸门徐徐启动，韶山灌区正式通水了。顿时，滔滔的涟河水飞淀出浪花，涌进新渠道。站在渠道两岸和两旁山坡的人群欢呼跳跃，鼓掌高呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
    韶山灌区工程是中共湖南省委、湖南省人民委员会去年六月二十八日决定于七月一日动工兴建的。整个工程，包括总干渠和南干渠、北干渠。现在完工通水的是总干渠和北干渠。这两条干渠穿过七十座山岭，跨越八十多条溪河、山冲，共长一百七十四公里，纵横伸展在湘乡、湘潭、宁乡三县的三角丘陵地带，可使这三个县的七十万亩农田受益（第二期工程南干渠建成后，受益面积可以增加到一百万亩以上）。在工程兴建中，共完成土石方一千五百万立方，混凝土和钢筋混凝土大约八万五千立方，凿开共长二千八百多米的隧洞七处，架设共长五千二百多米的渡槽十九座。兴建了渠下涵、倒虹吸、分水闸、人行桥等小型建筑物一千七百多处。工程只经过十个月的时间，于今年四月底建成。渠道经过两次三十多天的试水检验，情况良好。
    韶山灌区渠道既可引水灌溉，又可发展航运、防涝、撇洪，并可发展水产。它将在发展丘陵地区生产上发挥很大作用。
    这项建设工程是一座革命化的熔炉，一座活学活用毛主席著作的学校，出人材，出经验。全工地十万劳动大军，有六百多人在工地加入了中国共产党，一万多青年加入了共产主义青年团，四万二千多人被评为“五好”民工、职工，四千六百多个单位被评为“六好”单位。“达到了修好渠道炼好人，精神物质双丰收”的目的。
    韶山灌区总干渠、北干渠的胜利建成，是总路线的伟大胜利，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作的伟大胜利。实践表明：革命的人民，只要按毛主席的指示办事，就能产生无限的智慧和力量，就能在各项事业中，不断的有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进！（附图片）
