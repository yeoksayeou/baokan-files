    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 1st - The Chinese Pavilion, hailed as the "Flower of the Paris Exposition," successfully closed on May 30th. During the thirteen days of exhibition, the Chinese Pavilion received approximately 800,000 visitors.

    Many visitors enthusiastically praised the Chinese people and their great leader Mao Zedong after their visit, cheering "Long live the happy Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong, the liberator of the Chinese people, I salute you!"

    In the last three days of the exhibition, the number of visitors reached its peak. From morning till night, the audience entering the Chinese Pavilion was endless. Sometimes it almost blocked the entrance.

    Some visitors came twice or three times, and some even came five or six times. People who never visited the Expo before also came because of its reputation and left satisfied. The disabled came to visit in hand-cranked vehicles. Teachers from schools brought their students to visit collectively. One visitor said, "Your exhibition has attracted and fascinated Parisians, and there is no doubt about it."

    Many people gave the Chinese Pavilion staff a thumbs-up, praising China's arts and crafts. Many also wrote enthusiastic praises of the Chinese people and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong in the visitor's book. Hundreds of people paid tribute and greetings to Chairman Mao in the visitor's book.

    An overseas Chinese wrote: "How can I express the joy of an overseas Chinese in a foreign country in words? I can only sincerely shout: Long live New China and Chairman Mao!"

    Many visitors asked for Chairman Mao badges and photos of Chairman Mao.

    There are countless words of friendship and encouragement to the Chinese people in the visitor's book: "We want to be your friends." "Keep moving forward, you have chosen a good path!" "Learn from China!" "China is the future!" "Your exhibition reflects the strong vitality of China," "You can be proud to be Chinese," "Light comes from the East."

    During the exhibition, hundreds of people left messages and signed their names every day. On the last day of the exhibition, 890 people left messages and 800 people signed their names. Many of them were from other European countries and Asian, African, and Latin American countries; there were various languages in the visitor's book.

    Many people from French provinces regretted that Chinese arts and crafts could not be exhibited in their hometowns. A person from Bordeaux took many slides of the Chinese Pavilion and bought Chinese records to play with the slides. He told the Chinese staff that he had also taken slides back to show when the Chinese Pavilion was exhibited last year, which was very popular. Unfortunately, he could not explain in detail during the screening, so this year he specially copied the text descriptions of the exhibits.

    The Chinese Pavilion's small shop was also very popular, receiving approximately 10,000 customers every day.

    Many visitors said that this Chinese arts and crafts exhibition will remain in people's memories for a long time.

    毛泽东领导下走向幸福的中国人民万岁！
    八十万人参观巴黎博览会中国馆。许多人留言表示：“向中国学习！”“中国就是未来！”“光明来自东方！”
    新华社巴黎一日电　被誉为“巴黎博览会之花”的中国馆在五月三十日胜利闭幕。在十三天展出期间，中国馆一共接待了大约八十万观众。
    许多观众在参观后热情歌颂中国人民和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东，欢呼“在毛泽东领导下走向幸福的中国人民万岁！”“中国人民的解放者——毛泽东，我向你致敬！”
    在展出的最后三天，参观者的人数达到了高峰。从早到晚进入中国馆的观众川流不息。有时几乎把入口处都堵塞不通了。
    有些观众两次、三次地来看，最多的甚至来了五、六次。从来不参观博览会的人也慕名而来，满意而归。残废人坐着手摇车来参观。学校的老师带着他们的学生集体来参观。一位观众说：“你们的展览吸引了并且迷住了巴黎人，这一点是无人怀疑的。”
    许许多多人向中国馆工作人员伸出大拇指，赞扬中国的工艺美术。还有许多人在留言簿上写下了热情赞颂中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席的语言。在留言簿上向毛主席致敬和致意问候的有好几百人。
    一位华侨写道：“怎样才能用言语来表达一个身在异国的华侨的欢欣心情呢？我只能衷心地高呼：新中国和毛主席万岁”。
    许多参观者索要毛主席象纪念章和毛主席的照片。
    留言簿上向中国人民表示友谊和鼓励的话更是多得数不清：“我们愿成为你们的朋友。”“继续前进吧，你们选择了美好的道路！”“向中国学习！”“中国就是未来！”“你们的展览反映了中国强大的生命力”，“你们可以为自己是中国人而感到骄傲”，“光明来自东方”。
    展出期间，每天都有好几百人留言，好几百人签名留念。在展出的最后一天里，留言的有八百九十人，签名的有八百人。他们之中有许多是来自其他欧洲国家和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的；留言簿上各种文字都有。
    许多法国外省人惋惜中国工艺美术品不能在他们的故乡展出。一个波尔多人在中国馆照了许多幻灯片并买了中国唱片准备放映时配合。他对中国工作人员说，去年中国馆展出，他也照了幻灯片回去放映，大受欢迎。可惜他无法在放映时详加说明，所以今年他特地把展品的文字说明都抄了回去。
    中国馆附设的小卖部也很受欢迎，每天大约要接待一万名顾客。
    许多观众表示，这次中国工艺美术展览将长久地留在人们的记忆中。
