    Mao Zedong's works shine with golden light
    Hundreds of millions of people sing loudly  Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts

    Editor's Note: In the surging high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are using the force of a thunderbolt to verbally criticize and write condemnations of all kinds of monsters and demons, exposing and criticizing their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. At this fighting moment, the broad masses of the people greatly need to sing to their hearts' content, to sing about our great Party, to sing about our great leader Chairman Mao, to sing about the invincible and ever-victorious Mao Zedong Thought. Use singing to express revolutionary feelings and inspire fighting will.

    Today, we recommend a batch of newly created songs to our readers. These songs reflect the feelings of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, expressing their infinite loyalty and infinite love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and expressing their firm fighting spirit for the proletarian revolution.

    Let us all sing, sing "Mao Zedong's works point the way, the road is clear and bright, if you ask me which road I am taking, I will always follow the Party in revolution," sing "Workers, peasants and soldiers, hearts are the reddest, vanguards on the revolutionary road," sing "Mao Zedong Thought is a revolutionary treasure, whoever opposes it is our enemy"! Use magnificent songs to encourage revolutionary fighters, use passionate songs to sweep away monsters and demons!

    毛主席著作闪金光
    亿万人民高声唱  毛主席是我们心中红太阳
    编者按：在汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以雷霆万钧之势，对形形色色的牛鬼蛇神口诛笔伐，揭露和批判他们的反党反社会主义言行。在这战斗的时刻，广大群众很需要尽情地歌唱，歌唱我们伟大的党，歌唱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，歌唱战无不胜、攻无不克的毛泽东思想。用歌唱抒发革命情怀，激励战斗意志。
    今天，我们向读者推荐一批新创作的歌曲。这些歌曲反映了广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子的心情，表现了他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限忠诚和无限热爱，表现了他们对无产阶级革命的坚强斗志。
    让我们大家唱起歌来，唱“毛主席著作指方向，道路指得明又亮，要问我走的哪一条路，永远革命跟着党”，唱“工农兵，心最红，革命路上打先锋”，唱“毛泽东思想是革命的宝，谁要是反对它，谁就是我们的敌人”！用一句句雄壮的歌声鼓舞革命战士，用一句句激昂的歌声横扫牛鬼蛇神！
