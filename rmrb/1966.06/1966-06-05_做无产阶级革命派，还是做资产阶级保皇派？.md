To be a revolutionary of the proletariat or a royalist of the bourgeoisie?

Under the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, Peking University has launched a surge of the proletarian cultural revolution. The previously suppressed proletarian revolutionaries at Peking University have stood up. They have overthrown the rule of the bourgeois royalist clique headed by Lu Ping. A struggle to smash the capitalist restoration plot is unfolding in victory, and the bourgeois royalists are surrounded by the broad masses.

Peking University is one of the most important strongholds in China's educational field with a long history. Some major officials of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, who were anti-party and anti-socialist and pursued a revisionist line, had always regarded it as a base for contending with the proletariat for the younger generation.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists stubbornly carried out the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, practicing bourgeois dictatorship at Peking University. Under the rule of Lu Ping and his group, some institutions still nominally retained the banner of proletarian dictatorship, but in reality, they were engaged in evil deeds against proletarian dictatorship. They promoted a bourgeois revisionist educational line, trying to lead young students down the revisionist path and to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists elevated the so-called academic authorities of the bourgeoisie to the heavens, allowing them to spread poison among young students, systematically propagating bourgeois and revisionist thoughts. They suppressed revolutionary teachers and ruthlessly attacked them.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists carefully cultivated students who accepted their revisionist educational policies, providing them with various conveniences and special treatment. They attempted to cultivate a batch of revisionist seedlings and disperse them across the country.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists were extremely hostile to the children of workers and peasants, and to students who resisted their revisionist educational policies. These royalists devised many methods, from enrollment to teaching, from semester exams to graduation assignments, to restrict, exclude, harass, and discriminate against these good students, even engaging in extremely brutal struggles against them.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists fiercely resisted and sabotaged the socialist education movement. Revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University exposed the large number of anti-party and anti-socialist actions of Lu Ping and these royalists during the socialist education movement, and exposed a large amount of material on their implementation of revisionist educational policies. However, they still resisted. Under the direct command of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, they launched a fierce counterattack and revenge. They fabricated various charges against the revolutionaries, slapped them with many hats, organized attacks, and fought in relays. The brutal struggle they waged against a group of activists lasted as long as seven months. This was an extremely serious counter-revolutionary incident that occurred in 1965.

Lu Ping and this small clique of royalists often used the pretext of disrupting organizational discipline and opposing leadership to strike down those who did not obey their orders. Their party spirit is indeed strong; their party spirit is the party spirit of the bourgeois royalists, the party spirit of revisionist counter-revolutionaries. They indeed have organizational discipline and leadership. Their organizational discipline is the organizational discipline of the bourgeois royalists, and their leadership is the leadership of revisionist counter-revolutionaries. We must tell these gentlemen that what is opposed to your party spirit is the party spirit of the proletariat. Those who disrupt your organizational discipline are those who consciously observe the organizational discipline of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Those who oppose your leadership are those who consciously support and defend the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. These people are good comrades, they are proletarian revolutionaries, they are the vanguard of the proletarian revolution at Peking University. The Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao is to support the proletarian revolutionaries, overthrow your leadership, and overthrow you, this batch of royalists.

The struggle at Peking University is a struggle between the proletarian revolutionaries and the bourgeois royalists, a struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism, a struggle between the proletarian educational line and the bourgeois educational line, a struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, an extremely sharp class struggle.

The struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the younger generation is an important part of the class struggle in socialist society. The struggle between the two lines and two roads in the educational field ultimately comes down to whether to cultivate the younger generation into successors of the proletariat or successors of the bourgeoisie. This is a crucial matter concerning the future and the future appearance of our party and state.

Imperialism's fantasy of "peaceful evolution" for the new socialist China is placed on the younger generation. They mistakenly believe that our younger generation will not follow the path of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, but will follow the revisionist path. Lu Ping and his group stubbornly carried out the revisionist educational line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, precisely adapting to the needs of imperialism.

Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people in our country. Anyone who tries to block it, preventing Mao Zedong Thought from meeting the masses, will not succeed. Even in a stronghold that has been occupied by Lu Ping and his group for many years, the vast majority of students, staff, and teachers support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, support our party, and support the Party Central Committee. There, many students, staff, and teachers have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fought resolutely against Lu Ping and his group.

The struggle at Peking University is a typical struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration. All revolutionary comrades should draw extremely valuable experience and lessons from here.

The unfolding of the proletarian cultural revolution poses a sharp question to educators, to young students, to all cultural workers, and to everyone: in the life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the two classes and the two roads, on which side will you stand? Will you be a revolutionary of the proletariat or a royalist of the bourgeoisie? Everyone must make their own choice.

We believe that the vast majority of people, more than ninety-five percent, will certainly spurn the bourgeois royalists and stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, closely uniting around Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and carry the socialist revolutionary cause of our country and the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

### 做无产阶级革命派，还是做资产阶级保皇派？

    做无产阶级革命派，还是做资产阶级保皇派？
    在毛主席和党中央的伟大号召下，北京大学掀起了无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮。北京大学过去被压抑的无产阶级革命派，站起来了。他们推翻了以陆平为首的资产阶级保皇派的统治。一场粉碎资本主义复辟阴谋的斗争正在胜利展开，资产阶级保皇派陷入了广大群众的包围之中。
    北京大学是我国教育领域中的具有悠久历史的一个最重要阵地。反党反社会主义的、实行修正主义路线的前北京市委一些主要负责人，一直把它看成为同无产阶级争夺青年一代的基地。
    陆平等这一小撮保皇党，顽固地执行前北京市委的修正主义路线，在北京大学实行资产阶级专政。在陆平等人的统治下，一些机构名义上还保存着无产阶级专政的旗号，实际上干的是反对无产阶级专政的罪恶勾当。他们推行资产阶级的修正主义的教育路线，竭力要把青年学生引向修正主义的道路，竭力要把青年学生培养成资产阶级的接班人。
    陆平等这一小撮保皇党，把资产阶级的所谓学术权威捧上了天，让他们在青年学生中大肆放毒，系统地宣传资产阶级思想、修正主义思想。他们排挤革命的教师，对他们进行无情的打击。
    陆平等这一小撮保皇党，对于一些接受他们修正主义教育方针的学生，精心培养，给予各种方便条件和特殊照顾。他们企图培养出一批修正主义的苗子，把他们散布到各地。
    陆平等这一小撮保皇党，对于工农子弟，对于抵制他们那一套修正主义教育方针的学生，极端仇视。这些保皇党订出许多办法，从招生到教学，从学期考试到毕业分配，都千方百计地来限制、排斥、刁难和歧视这类好学生，甚至对他们进行极粗暴的斗争。
    陆平等这一小撮保皇党，拼命抵制和破坏社会主义教育运动。北京大学的革命师生在社会主义教育运动中，揭发了陆平这些保皇党反党反社会主义的大量言行，揭发了他们实行修正主义教育方针的大量材料，但他们仍然顽抗。他们在前北京市委的直接指挥下，还疯狂地反扑，进行反攻倒算。他们给革命派捏造种种罪名，戴了许多帽子，组织围攻，轮番作战。他们对一批积极分子进行的这种残酷斗争，竟长达七个月之久。这是一九六五年发生的一个极端严重的反革命事件。
    陆平等一小撮保皇党，动辄用破坏组织纪律、反领导这些名义打击不服从他们命令的人。他们的党性确实很强，他们的党性就是资产阶级保皇党的党性，就是修正主义反革命的党性。他们确实是有组织纪律的，有领导的。他们的组织纪律就是资产阶级保皇党的组织纪律，他们的领导就是修正主义反革命的领导。我们必须告诉这班老爷们，同你们的党性敌对的，正是无产阶级的党性。破坏你们的组织纪律的，正是自觉地遵守无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的组织纪律。反对你们的领导的，正是自觉地拥护和捍卫以毛主席为首的党中央的领导。这些人是好同志，是无产阶级革命派，是北京大学无产阶级革命的先锋。以毛主席为首的党中央，就是要支持无产阶级革命派，推翻你们的领导，打倒你们这批保皇党。
    北京大学的斗争，是无产阶级革命派和资产阶级保皇派的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和修正主义的斗争，是无产阶级教育路线和资产阶级教育路线的斗争，是革命和反革命的斗争，是极其尖锐的阶级斗争。
    资产阶级同无产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争，是社会主义社会阶级斗争的一个重要部分。教育领域里的两条路线两条道路的斗争，归根到底，就是把青年一代培养成为无产阶级接班人，还是培养成为资产阶级接班人。这是关系到我们党和国家的前途和将来面貌的关键性的大事。
    帝国主义对社会主义新中国“和平演变”的幻想，寄托在青年一代。他们妄想我们的青年一代不走马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的道路，而走修正主义的道路。陆平等人顽固地执行前北京市委修正主义的教育路线，正是适应了帝国主义的需要。
    毛泽东思想在我国日益深入人心。任何人要想封锁，不让毛泽东思想和群众见面，都是办不到的。就是在被陆平等人盘踞了多年的这样一个顽固堡垒中，绝大多数学生、职工、教师，都是拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，拥护我们党，拥护我们党中央的。在那里，很多学生、职工和教师，一直高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同陆平等人进行坚决的斗争。
    北京大学的斗争，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争的一个典型。一切革命的同志，都应该从这里得到极其宝贵的经验教训。
    无产阶级文化大革命的展开，向教育工作者，向青年学生，向一切文化工作者，也向一切人提出了一个尖锐的问题：在无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两个阶级、两条道路的生死斗争中，究竟站在哪一边，是做无产阶级革命派，还是当资产阶级保皇派？每个人都必须做出自己的选择。
    我们相信，绝大多数人，百分之九十五以上的人，必然会唾弃资产阶级保皇派，站在无产阶级革命派这一边，紧紧地团结在毛主席、党中央的周围，把我国的社会主义革命事业，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
