    Actively Studying and Applying Mao Zedong Thought to Break Down Rules and Regulations and Conservatism
    China's Power Plant Production is Unprecedentedly Good
    (Xinhua News Agency, June 6) The broad masses of workers in China's power industry system are actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, sweeping away the ideological obstacle of "potential reaching its limit," and creating a great new situation in the movement to increase production and practice economy.
    Since the beginning of this year, the production situation of power plants across the country has been unprecedentedly good, with significant decreases in both coal consumption and plant power consumption. The total savings from these two items amount to more than 300,000 tons of coal for the state. In addition, power plants in various regions have vigorously mixed in low-quality coal, saving more than one million tons of good coal for the state and supporting industries such as steel and chemical fertilizers.
    These new achievements of China's power industry once again eloquently demonstrate that even in highly automated and mechanized enterprises like thermal power plants, it is people, not things, that play the decisive role. The practice of power plants in various regions proves that as long as politics are emphasized and people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created.
    China's power industry has developed rapidly in recent years. In addition to the doubling of electricity generation, significant achievements have been made in various other economic and technical tasks. The coal consumption for electricity generation in 1965 was 20 percent lower than in 1957. Boiler thermal efficiency approached and reached international advanced levels. Therefore, it was generally believed that the potential of China's thermal power plants had been tapped "almost completely," and that it would be impossible for the annual decline in coal consumption for electricity generation to reach more than 10 grams as in previous years.
    Now, practical results have proven that this idea of "potential reaching its limit" is a manifestation of metaphysical thinking that does not emphasize politics and sees things but not people. At the beginning of this year, the broad masses of power industry workers, through extensive debates on political and professional matters, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's instructions on increasing production and practicing economy, and universally raised their awareness. They realized that increasing production and practicing economy is not only an economic task but also a major political task, which is related to the speed of socialist construction and the early completion of the Third Five-Year Plan. Whether it is "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "building the country through diligence and frugality" or "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" and "extravagance and waste" is the dividing line between the two ideologies and the two roads of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the issue of construction. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, many power plant workers fiercely opened fire on various rules and regulations and conservative ideas that hindered increased production and practiced economy, and at the same time, they adopted practical and feasible organizational and technical measures, thus quickly opening up a new situation.
    For many years, the Fuxin Power Plant had three imported units whose output could only reach 90 percent due to some manufacturing and design problems. Some people thought that it would be difficult to further improve the equipment output. However, in this year's movement to increase production and practice economy, the workers studied Chairman Mao's works and worked hard on the word "use." The entire plant, from top to bottom, exposed and examined the erroneous ideas of fearing risks and seeking ease in the past, and diligently practiced hard skills in operation, meticulously exploring the rules and finding key points. After repeated research and bold experiments, various effective measures were taken, two unnecessary valves were cut off from each unit, and the steam pressure and temperature reached the rated standards, and the equipment output reached the design capacity. This one item alone can save more than 10,000 tons of coal a year. In addition to other measures, the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by the Fuxin Power Plant in the first quarter of this year has dropped to 381 grams, creating a new record in history.
    In the past, many people in the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant were also bound by foreign and old frameworks, believing that high-pressure boilers must have three feed water pumps for water supply, otherwise it would affect safe power generation. This year, the workers studied Chairman Mao's works with this problem in mind and universally realized that to make revolution, one must struggle and dare to take risks. They proposed stopping one feed water pump and conducted repeated tests with the support of the plant leaders. The results proved that only two feed water pumps can fully meet the needs of high-pressure boilers. This measure not only saves equipment but also saves more than 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity every day.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of power industry workers, by actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, have improved their political sense of responsibility, clarified the view of working for the revolution, and urgently demanded to master advanced technology. Some advanced experiences that were not easily promoted in the past, such as "operating under the red line" and "rational start and stop of machines and furnaces," have now been universally promoted. Many workers have also consciously paid attention to saving every bit and plugged many waste loopholes, correspondingly improving power generation capacity.

### 活学活用毛主席著作破除清规戒律和因循守旧思想  我国电厂生产情况空前良好

    活学活用毛主席著作破除清规戒律和因循守旧思想
    我国电厂生产情况空前良好
    新华社六日讯　我国电力工业系统广大职工活学活用毛泽东思想，扫除“潜力到顶”的思想障碍，在增产节约运动中又创开了一个大好局面。
    今年以来，全国电厂的生产情况空前良好，煤耗和厂用电都大幅度下降。两项合计，为国家节约了三十多万吨煤炭。此外，各地电厂还大力掺烧了劣质煤，为国家节省了一百多万吨好煤，支援了钢铁、化肥等工业。
    全国电力工业取得的这些新成绩，再一次雄辩地说明，即使在火力发电厂这样高度自动化机械化的企业里，起决定性作用的同样是人而不是物。各地电厂的实践证明，只要突出政治，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，任何人间奇迹都是可以创造出来的。
    我国电力工业近几年发展很快。除了发电量成倍增长以外，其他各项经济技术工作也都取得了很大成绩。一九六五年的发电煤耗比一九五七年降低百分之二十。锅炉热效率接近和达到了国际先进水平。因此，一般人便认为，我国火力发电厂的潜力已经挖掘得“差不多了”，每年发电煤耗的下降幅度如果要象往年那样达到十克以上，已经是不可能的事。
    现在实践结果证明，这种“潜力到顶”的想法，正是不突出政治，见物而不见人的形而上学思想的表现。广大电力工业职工在今年一开始，通过政治和业务关系的大辩论，活学活用了毛主席的有关增产节约的指示，普遍提高了觉悟。他们认识到，增产节约不仅是经济任务，更是重大的政治任务，它关系到社会主义建设速度和第三个五年计划的提前完成；多快好省、勤俭建国，还是少慢差费、铺张浪费，是无产阶级和资产阶级在建设问题上的两种思想两条道路的分界线。因此，许多电厂职工今年一开始就狠狠地向阻碍增产节约的各种清规戒律和因循守旧思想开了火，同时又采取了切实可行的组织和技术措施，因而很快就打开一个新局面。
    阜新电厂多年以来，有三台进口机组由于制造和设计上有些问题，出力只能达到百分之九十。有些人认为再提高设备出力是很难办到的。但是在今年的增产节约运动中，职工们学习了毛主席的著作，并且在“用”字上狠下功夫，全厂从上到下揭发和检查了过去怕冒风险、贪图省事的错误思想，在操作上大练过硬本领，细致地摸规律、找关键。经过反复研究，大胆试验，采取了各种有效措施，每台机组割掉了两个不必要的阀门，汽压、汽温都达到了额定标准，设备出力达到了设计能力。仅这一项，一年就能节约煤炭一万多吨。加上其他措施，阜新电厂今年第一季度每发一度电煤耗已下降到三百八十一克，创造有史以来的新纪录。
    上海杨树浦电厂过去不少人也由于受了洋框框、旧框框的束缚，认为高压锅炉必须有三台给水泵供水，不然就会影响安全发电。今年，职工们带着这个问题学习了毛主席的著作，普遍认识到：要革命，就要斗争，要敢于担风险。他们提出了停掉一台给水泵的建议，并且在厂领导的支持下进行了反复试验。结果证明，只用两台给水泵完全能够满足高压锅炉的需要。这项措施既节省了设备，每天还能节省一万多度电力。
    在增产节约运动中，广大电业职工通过活学活用毛泽东思想，提高了政治责任感，明确了为革命劳动的观点，迫切要求掌握先进技术。过去有些不易推广的先进经验，如“压红线运行”、“机炉合理启停”等，现在都已普遍推广开了。许多职工还自觉地注意点滴节约，堵塞了许多浪费漏洞，相应地提高了发电能力。
