    Following Chairman Mao's Teachings and Taking the Road of Self-Reliance
    Our Country's New Wear-Resistant Plowshare Material Officially Put into Production
    This New Product's Birth Has Great Significance for Better Utilizing Our Country's Resources and Developing Agricultural Machinery Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: China's newly researched and successfully developed new type of plowshare material has recently been officially put into production.
    This low-cost, low-alloy, high-strength new type of wear-resistant plowshare material, suitable for soil-working parts of agricultural implements, was jointly researched and developed by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Mechanization Sciences, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Anshan Hongqi Tractor Factory, and other units, based on the characteristics of our country's resources. The birth of this new product has great significance for better utilizing our country's resources and developing agricultural machinery materials through self-reliance.
    Agricultural machinery often works in the fields, and its soil-working parts (such as plowshares, moldboards, hoe teeth, etc.) are inevitably worn down by soil, stones, and tree roots during tillage. The wear of these parts not only consumes a large amount of high-quality steel but also increases the tractor's pulling resistance and fuel consumption, deteriorates the quality of tillage, affects agricultural production, and raises operating costs. Plowshares, in particular, have higher requirements for materials, needing to be both hard and wear-resistant, and tough and non-brittle. In the past, our country always selected materials according to foreign standards, resulting in high costs and unsatisfactory service life.
    Foreign countries have been researching plowshare materials for more than thirty years. Some countries use high-carbon tool steel, while others develop high-chromium alloy steel. Relevant departments in our country have also made many efforts in the past, but without satisfactory results.
    What direction should the development of agricultural machinery materials in our country take? Is it to follow behind foreigners, or to take our own path? This is a major question of direction. Relevant researchers constantly studied Chairman Mao's works, enhanced their ideological awareness, overcame their fear of difficulties, and went deep into the front line of production to conduct a large number of experiments. They worked together with tractor drivers in different regions and seasons, conducting large-scale comparative tests on more than 140,000 mu of cultivated land, and finally obtained reliable data. A large number of tests have shown that this new type of wear-resistant plowshare material, compared with commonly used plowshare materials, has the advantages of high strength and wear resistance, as well as easy control of part heat treatment and manufacturing quality, uniform hardness, and fine metallographic structure. It is particularly suitable for production by small and medium-sized agricultural implement factories with relatively simple equipment. (Attached picture)
    Right picture: Shanxi Province has produced a 20-horsepower small Yuejin brand tractor. In the past, commune members in mountainous and hilly areas said, "Tractors are really good, but our plots are too small." Now, with this kind of tractor, even small plots of three to five mu can be cultivated mechanically.

    遵循毛主席教导走自力更生道路
    我国新型犁铧耐磨材料正式投入生产
    这项新产品的诞生对于更好地利用我国资源发展农业机械材料有重大意义
    新华社二日讯　我国新研究成功的新型犁铧材料，已在最近正式投入了生产。
    这种适用于农具土壤工作部件的低成本、低合金、高强度的新型犁铧耐磨材料，是中国农业机械化科学研究院、鞍山钢铁公司、鞍山红旗拖拉机厂等单位，根据我国资源特点共同研究成功的。这项新产品的诞生，对于更好地利用我国资源，自力更生发展农业机械材料具有重大的意义。
    农业机械经常在田野工作，其土壤工作部件（如犁铧、犁镜、锄齿等）不可避免地在翻耕土壤过程中，被土壤或石头、树根所磨损。这些零件的磨损不仅消耗了大量的优质钢材，同时还会引起拖拉机牵引阻力、油耗的增加，耕地质量变坏，影响农业生产，提高了作业成本。特别是犁铧，对材料的要求更高，既要硬而耐磨，又要韧而不脆。过去我国一直按国外的标准选用材料，因此成本高而使用寿命不理想。
    国外对犁铧材料研究已有三十年以上的历史。有的国家采用高碳工具钢，有的国家则发展高铬合金钢。我国有关部门过去也曾经作过不少的努力，但没有获得满意的结果。
    我国农业机械材料应朝什么方向发展？是跟在外国人后面跑，还是走我们自己的路，这是一个重大的方向问题。有关研究人员不断学习了毛主席著作，提高了思想觉悟，克服了畏难情绪，深入到生产第一线，进行了大量的试验工作。他们在不同地区，不同季节，同拖拉机手共同作业，进行了十四万余亩耕作的大面积对比试验，终于获得了可靠的数据。大量的试验表明，这种新型犁铧耐磨材料和常用的犁铧材料比较，具有高强度耐磨，以及零件热处理制造质量容易控制、硬度均匀、金相组织细密等优点，特别适用于设备比较简陋的中小型农具厂生产。（附图片）
