    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 21st -- Our country's electricity industry workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and proceeding from the overall interests of national construction, are vigorously promoting the experience of live-line work, providing favorable conditions for various departments of the national economy to complete the Third Five-Year Plan.
    Recently, the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power held a national on-site observation and demonstration conference on live-line work in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, comprehensively reviewing the major achievements in promoting live-line work in recent years, and exchanging relevant work experiences.
    Live-line work refers to the maintenance work carried out by power workers on energized high-voltage lines or equipment. In the past, when our country's power workers repaired high-voltage lines and equipment, they generally had to cut off the power, which affected the production of industrial departments, affected people's lives, and caused great losses to the national economy. The advantage of promoting live-line work is that it can reduce the number and duration of power outages, achieve uninterrupted power supply, and create more wealth for various sectors of the national economy. According to calculations, universally promoting the experience of live-line work nationwide can provide at least several hundred million more kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is enough to produce tens of millions of tons of fertilizer or steel. Therefore, it has significant economic significance for the national economy.
    The information provided at the conference showed that live-line work has greatly developed in our country. This experience was first successfully tested by workers at the Anshan Electric Power Bureau in 1958. At that time, it could only be carried out on lines with relatively low voltage. Later, the Technical Improvement Bureau of the Northeast Electric Power Administration successfully tested the experience of "equipotential" live-line work on ultra-high-voltage lines. Currently, live-line work has been popularized in twenty-seven provinces and cities across the country, and the number of work items has increased from the original dozen or so to more than one hundred and sixty. Voltage levels include 10,000 volts, 35,000 volts, 110,000 volts, and 220,000 volts. Whether it is plateau, plain, or mountain area, whether it is the hot south or the frigid north, operations can be carried out. Live-line work tools have also developed from large, bulky, rough, and heavy to small, exquisite, refined, and light, basically achieving portability and rope-based operation. Operators can carry the tools away with just a backpack, which is very convenient. Many live-line work projects have reached and exceeded the world's advanced levels; some projects that other countries do not have, we have; some projects that other countries have, we also have. These facts fully demonstrate that our country's electricity industry workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are intelligent and courageous. They dare to break the "authority" of foreign experts, dare to take our own road, and bravely scale the peaks of modern science and technology.
    The many experiences exchanged at the conference showed that as long as we creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, give prominence to politics, resolutely oppose old frameworks and old habits, establish the idea of serving the people and serving industrial and agricultural production wholeheartedly, conscientiously act according to scientific laws, do a good job in thorough safety measures, and operate according to regulations, live-line work is absolutely safe. Conversely, if politics is not in command, if we disarm ourselves ideologically, and if the operation is sloppy, accidents will occur even during power outages. Many units with relatively good promotion of live-line work, such as the power departments in Anshan, Jinzhou, Jilin, Harbin, and Luda, have paid attention to grasping the ideological revolutionization of people, cultivating a professional team with red ideology, good work style, and sophisticated technology, and have made improvements in tools. Over the years, they have carried out thousands of live-line operations without any major or minor accidents.
    Currently, workers in our country's electricity industry departments are further expanding the projects and scope of live-line work. Some areas have begun to list live-line work as a regular maintenance method, so that continuous power supply can be achieved throughout the year, ensuring the needs of industrial and agricultural production. Some units, on the basis of realizing live-line work in the entire power supply system, are further studying how to change some of the live-line work in the substation and distribution systems to all live-line work. The power generation system is also studying live-line work. Once these experiments are successful, they will have a profound impact on our country's socialist construction.

    电力工业职工敢于打破洋“权威”
    实行带电作业　攀登技术高峰
    新华社鞍山二十一日电  我国电力工业职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从国家建设的整体利益出发，大力推行带电作业的经验，为国民经济各个部门完成第三个五年计划提供了有利条件。
    最近，水利电力部在辽宁省鞍山市召开了全国带电作业现场观摩表演会议，全面地检阅了几年来推行带电作业的重大成就，并且交流了有关这方面的工作经验。
    带电作业，就是电力工人在有电的高压线路或设备上进行检修工作。过去，我国电力工人检修高压线路和设备，一般都要停电，因而影响工业部门的生产，影响人民生活，给国民经济造成很大损失。推行带电作业的好处是，可以减少停电的次数和时间，做到不间断地供电，能够为国民经济各部门创造更多的财富。据计算，全国普遍推行带电作业经验，每年至少可以多供几亿度电，这些电足够生产上千万吨的化肥或钢铁，因此，它对国民经济具有重大的经济意义。
    会议提供的资料表明，带电作业在我国有了很大的发展。这项经验最早是在一九五八年首先由鞍山电业局职工试验成功的。当时，还只能在电压比较低的线路上进行。以后，东北电业管理局技术改进局又试验成功了在超高压线路上进行“等电位”带电作业的经验。目前，带电作业已经普及到全国二十七个省市地区，作业项目也由原来的十几个发展到一百六十多个，电压等级包括一万伏、三万五千伏、十一万伏到二十二万伏。不管是高原、平川、山地，也不管是炎热的南方还是严寒的北方，都能操作。带电作业的工具也由大、笨、粗、重，发展到小、巧、精、轻，基本上实现了轻便化、绳索化，操作工人只用背包就可以把工具带走，非常方便。其中不少带电作业项目达到和超过了世界先进水平；有的项目国外没有的我们有了，国外有的我们也有了。这些事实充分说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国电力工业职工是聪明勇敢的，他们敢于打破外国专家的“权威”，敢于闯我国自己的道路，勇于攀登现代科学技术的高峰。
    会议交流的许多经验表明，只要活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，狠反老框框老习惯，树立彻底为人民服务、为工农业生产服务的思想，认真按科学规律办事，做好周密的安全措施，按制度操作，带电作业是绝对安全的。相反，如果政治不挂帅，思想上解除了武装，操作马马虎虎，就是停电作业也会发生事故。不少推广带电作业比较好的单位，如鞍山、锦州、吉林、哈尔滨、旅大等地的电力部门，由于注意抓人的思想革命化，培养了一批思想红、作风好、技术精的专业队伍，并在工具上做了改进，几年来进行了上千次的带电作业，并没有发生过一次大小事故。
    目前，我国电力工业部门职工正在进一步扩大带电作业的项目和范围。有的地区已开始把带电作业列为正规的检修方法，这样就可以做到常年不停电，保证工农业生产的需要。还有些单位在供电系统全部实现带电作业的基础上，又在进一步研究把变电、配电系统的部分带电作业改为全部带电作业。发电系统也在研究带电作业。这些试验成功后，将对我国社会主义建设产生深远影响。
