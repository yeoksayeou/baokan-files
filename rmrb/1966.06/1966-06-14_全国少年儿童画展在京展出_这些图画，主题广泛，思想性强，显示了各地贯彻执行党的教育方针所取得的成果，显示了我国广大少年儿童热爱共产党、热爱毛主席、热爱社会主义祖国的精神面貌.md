    National Children's Art Exhibition Opens in Beijing
    These paintings, with broad themes and strong ideological content, demonstrate the achievements made in various regions in implementing the Party's education policy, and showcase the spiritual outlook of the vast number of Chinese children who love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and love the socialist motherland.
    The National Children's Art Exhibition officially opened at the Beijing Art Museum on the 5th.
    The more than two hundred paintings on display were selected from works by primary and secondary school students and kindergarten children from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. The authors are aged five to sixteen. These paintings have broad themes and strong ideological content, demonstrating the achievements made in various regions in implementing the Party's education policy and showcasing the spiritual outlook of the vast number of Chinese children who love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and love the socialist motherland.
    《毛主席是我们心中的太阳》("Chairman Mao is the Sun in Our Hearts") is the title of a painting by Wan Lvpíng, an eleven-year-old from Beijing. The painting depicts children of all ethnic groups in China cheering around the kind Chairman Mao, expressing the Chinese children's love for Chairman Mao. In Wang Zhao's 《我们就是向日葵，太阳就是共产党》("We are Sunflowers, the Sun is the Communist Party") from Beijing No. 39 Middle School, a radiant red sun shines brightly, illuminating a field of vigorously growing sunflowers, symbolizing the glory of the Party and Chairman Mao, which nurture the healthy growth of Chinese children.
    The young authors' paintings, such as 《夜读》("Night Reading"), 《在候车室里》("In the Waiting Room"), 《比赛前》("Before the Competition"), 《我和奶奶》("Me and Grandma"), and 《全家学毛选》("The Whole Family Studies the Selected Works of Mao"), vividly reflect the scene of children enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's works. 《夜读》("Night Reading") depicts rural children reading Chairman Mao's 《愚公移山》("The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains") around an oil lamp at night. The characters are vivid and the emotions are sincere. From the excited expressions of the figures in the painting, it can be seen that Chairman Mao's works have given them enormous strength.
    Class education is another important theme of these exhibits. Paintings such as 《不忘昔日苦》("Never Forget the Sufferings of the Past"), 《听老贫农讲村史》("Listening to Old Poor Peasants Talk About Village History"), 《在革命烈士墓前》("At the Tomb of Revolutionary Martyrs"), and 《接过爸爸的针线包》("Taking Over Dad's Sewing Kit") are all excellent. Some of the paintings on display reflect the participation of children in the current Socialist Cultural Revolution.
    With rich imagination, many young authors painted the great achievements of all aspects of the socialist construction of the motherland with innocence and enthusiasm. Many of the authors of these paintings are the children of workers and farmers. The paintings they created with the theme of their parents' factories, mines, and people's communes are very intimate and touching. 《山村新貌》("New Look of Mountain Village"), painted by Zhang Shǒuhuái, a thirteen-year-old student in Chengdu, depicts a tall dam, tier upon tier of pumping stations diverting river water to terraced fields high in the mountains, as well as orchards all over the mountains, layered terraces, and vigorously growing crops.
    The paintings that children painted with their own lives as the theme, such as 《下丁家小愚公》("Little Yugong of Xia Dingjia") painted by Fàn Huìyǔ from Huáng Xiàn, Shandong, and 《不要吃社里的菜》("Don't Eat the Commune's Vegetables") painted by Zhāng Hóngjiàn from Lüda City, Liaoning, have a strong breath of life, vividly reflecting their ideological character of loving labor and loving the collective.
    This exhibition is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the National Committee for the Defense of Children of the Chinese People, and the Chinese Artists Association. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国少年儿童画展在京展出
    这些图画，主题广泛，思想性强，显示了各地贯彻执行党的教育方针所取得的成果，显示了我国广大少年儿童热爱共产党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义祖国的精神面貌
    全国少年儿童画展五日起在北京美术馆正式展出。
    这次展出的二百多幅图画，是从全国各省、市、自治区的中小学学生和幼儿园孩子的作品中选出来的，作者的年龄是五岁到十六岁。这些图画主题广泛，思想性强，显示了各地贯彻党的教育方针所取得的成果和我国广大少年儿童热爱共产党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义祖国的精神面貌。
    《毛主席是我们心中的太阳》是北京十一岁的万绿萍的一幅画的题目。画面上我国各民族的少年儿童正围着慈祥的毛主席欢呼，表现了我国少年儿童对毛主席的热爱。北京三十九中王昭的《我们就是向日葵，太阳就是共产党》这幅画中，画着一轮红日光芒四射，照耀着一片茁壮生长的向日葵，象征党和毛主席的光辉，哺育着我国少年儿童在健康成长。
    小作者们画的《夜读》、《在候车室里》、《比赛前》、《我和奶奶》、《全家学毛选》等，生动地反映了少年儿童热烈学习毛主席著作的情景。《夜读》画的是农村少年们夜晚围着油灯在读毛主席的《愚公移山》，人物形象生动，感情真挚。从画中人物兴奋的表情可以看出，毛主席的著作给了他们巨大的力量。
    阶级教育是这些展品的另一个重要主题。《不忘昔日苦》、《听老贫农讲村史》、《在革命烈士墓前》、《接过爸爸的针线包》等画都很出色。展出的画中有一部分是反映少年儿童参加当前社会主义文化大革命的。
    许多小作者以丰富的想象力，天真而又热情地画出了祖国社会主义建设各方面的巨大成就。这些图画的作者有许多是工人、农民的子弟，他们以自己父母工作的工厂、矿山和人民公社为主题画的画，非常亲切感人。成都十三岁的学生张守淮画的《山村新貌》，画着高大的水坝，节节的扬水站把河水引向高高山上的梯田里，还有遍山的果树、层层的梯田和茁壮的庄稼。
    孩子们以他们自己的生活为主题画的画，例如山东黄县范惠宇画的《下丁家小愚公》，辽宁旅大市张洪建画的《不要吃社里的菜》等，有着强烈的生活气息，生动地反映了他们热爱劳动、热爱集体的思想品德。
    这个展览是由教育部、共青团中央、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会和中国美术家协会联合主办的。　（新华社）
