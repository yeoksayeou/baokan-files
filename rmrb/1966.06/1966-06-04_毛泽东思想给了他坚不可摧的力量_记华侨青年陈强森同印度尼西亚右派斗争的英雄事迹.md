    Mao Zedong Thought Gave Him an Indomitable Spirit
    —A Record of Overseas Chinese Youth Chen Qiangshen's Heroic Struggle Against the Indonesian Rightists

    Editor's Note: The 21-year-old overseas Chinese student Chen Qiangshen, trapped in the bloody den of the Indonesian reactionaries, endured brutal torture by fascist thugs, remained steadfast and unyielding, and continued to fight, defending the dignity and honor of the motherland. His deeds fully demonstrated the fearless heroism of the Chinese people and were praised and admired by the people of the motherland.

    What power made this overseas Chinese youth so righteous and indomitable? It was his boundless love for the great motherland and his boundless faith in the great thought of Mao Zedong.

    Chen Qiangshen grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. Reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words made him understand revolutionary principles and established his firm resolve and conviction to struggle for the interests of the motherland and the people. Therefore, he could disregard life and death and fight to the end.

    In this struggle, although the Indonesian reactionaries were ferocious and ruthless, they were defeated and weak in the face of Chen Qiangshen's unyielding spirit. Chen Qiangshen's heroic struggle proved that overseas Chinese with a powerful socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao as their backing are invincible. The anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese actions carried out by the Indonesian reactionaries under the instructions of American imperialism will only backfire and hasten their own doom.

    Chen Qiangshen, who was kidnapped and illegally detained for five days and nights by the right-wing reactionary organization "KAMI" (Indonesian Student Action Unity Organization) in Indonesia, recently returned to the motherland from Jakarta. In the den of the thugs, he suffered severe beatings and interrogations, leaving him with severe injuries, a broken jaw, and bloodied clothes. However, he remained steadfast and unyielding, firmly refuting the right-wing thugs' slanders, defending the dignity and honor of the motherland, and foiling the right-wing forces' plots. Through the protests of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the negotiations of the overseas Chinese organizations, the Indonesian right-wing forces finally had to release him.

    Chen Qiangshen took "listening to Chairman Mao's words" as his oath and "serving the people" as taught by Chairman Mao as his life's purpose, demonstrating an indomitable will in the struggle. When the Indonesian reactionaries persecuted him madly, he, with boundless courage and strength, completely disregarded his own life and death and fought to the end to defend the honor of the motherland. His deeds greatly inspired the suffering overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

    Recording the Evidence of the Right-Wing Thugs

    On the afternoon of March 18, several hundred armed Indonesian soldiers and thugs in more than ten cars suddenly rushed into the Jakarta Chinese Middle School, a school with a long history among the overseas Chinese, and carried out a mad attack and destruction. At that time, Chen Qiangshen, a senior three student standing at the school gate, was extremely indignant at such despicable and barbaric behavior. To capture the evidence of the thugs, he took out a notebook and recorded the license plate numbers of all the cars the right-wing soldiers and thugs were riding in.

    The thugs patrolling the street saw him recording the car numbers and panicked. A thug in a yellow uniform suddenly rushed over and choked his neck, threatening him with a knife. Several other thugs also rushed over, snatched his notebook, and dragged him to a military vehicle. The thugs reported to the four soldiers wearing blue caps in the car: "He recorded our car numbers, including the car number of General Yani's (former commander of the Indonesian Army) wife." At that moment, several soldiers and thugs immediately beat Chen Qiangshen up in a frenzy. Chen Qiangshen saw the right-wing soldiers' panic-stricken expressions and remembered Chairman Mao's judgment that all reactionaries are paper tigers, seeing through the hollow nature of the right-wing forces. Although the right-wing thugs beat him with fists and feet, his body was filled with the strength of struggle and the confidence of victory.

    The right-wing soldiers and thugs, ignoring Chen Qiangshen's protests, kidnapped him into another car and drove to North China and Huaqiao schools to carry out destruction and looting, taking the looted items away in the car. In the car, the thugs beat Chen Qiangshen while interrogating him: "Where are there more overseas Chinese schools? Show us the way." Chen Qiangshen looked at these thugs with contempt and replied firmly: "I don't know!"

    After the thugs finished destroying these overseas Chinese schools, as the car passed by the gate of the American Embassy, they shamelessly whistled and waved, reporting to their masters.

    Chen Qiangshen realized that he had been kidnapped, and a severe struggle and test lay ahead. At this moment, he thought of the great leader Chairman Mao, the great motherland, and the 650 million people of the motherland, and he felt fearless. He made up his mind: he must fight to the end in this struggle.

    Head Can Be Cut Off, But Will Not Surrender to Right-Wing Thugs

    In the evening, the car drove into an office of "KAMI." Chen Qiangshen saw a blue-eyed, high-nosed Westerner eating dinner in the courtyard. The thugs respectfully handed over various items they had looted from the overseas Chinese schools to this Westerner. Then, several thugs locked Chen Qiangshen in a dark room. Chen Qiangshen knew this was a torture chamber. How to deal with these ruthless and unreasonable thugs? Chen Qiangshen recalled the many stories of revolutionaries fighting against the enemy in prison that he had read, and the first thing that came to his mind was "Nine Red Hearts to the Motherland." He thought: "I am an overseas Chinese student and have never violated Indonesian laws. The thugs kidnapping me is illegal. Justice is on my side, and with a powerful socialist motherland as my backing, there is nothing to fear!"

    The thugs first searched him and took away his ballpoint pen, slippers, and cash. Then, they pointed to the bloodstains on the wall and threatened: "Do you see those bloodstains? You must tell the truth." They also pointed to the dark window and said: "Outside is the grave. If you don't talk, this will be your fate!" One thug even savagely said: "I haven't 'eaten' anyone for a long time."

    The thugs immediately accused Chen Qiangshen of being a "spy" for the Chinese Embassy. Chen Qiangshen immediately refuted them, saying that the Chinese Embassy had no spies. He stood up straight and said, "I am an overseas Chinese student. Since you are destroying our school, I have the right to record your crimes. You are falsely accusing me, and you have no right to arrest me! What you are doing is illegal and shameful!" The thugs asked, "Where are you from?" Chen Qiangshen replied, "I am Chinese!" The thugs provocatively asked him why he did not take Indonesian citizenship, and Chen Qiangshen replied confidently: "Choosing citizenship is my freedom and is also in accordance with Indonesian law. You have no right to interfere. I love my motherland and also love the Indonesian people."

    The thugs could not get anything out of Chen Qiangshen and were furious. Like a pack of wolves, some punched and kicked him, while others whipped him with military belts, chains, and iron rods. Chen Qiangshen was injured in six places on his head, his face was swollen and bruised, his jaw was broken, and blood flowed from various wounds, soaking his shirt. He was beaten unconscious several times and then revived by the thugs with cold water. Later, the thugs tore open his shirt, burned his chest with cigarette butts, forced him to drink soap water, and pushed him to the ground, stomping on his chest with military boots.

    While torturing him, the thugs shouted and forced Chen Qiangshen to admit that he was a "spy" for the Chinese Embassy. However, the 21-year-old Chen Qiangshen remained steadfast and unyielding in the face of the thugs' cruel torture and threat of death. During this process, his mind was always filled with a passage from Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "'Man's death is certain. Only the manner of it is in question. It can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Chen Qiangshen had read this passage countless times and could recite it from memory. Each time he read it, he became more clear about the purpose of life and was greatly inspired. However, he had never felt the profound meaning of this sentence as deeply as he did today; he had never felt as strongly as he did today that it gave him the strength of a thunderbolt. He also thought of his own oath written behind a picture of Chairman Mao in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong":

    "Chairman Mao, I love you!
    Chairman Mao, I am a son of the people.
    I will serve the people,
    For the liberation of all mankind,
    I will listen to your words!"

    Chen Qiangshen, who disregarded his own life and death, was determined to defend the dignity and honor of the motherland with his blood and life. Every time he regained consciousness, he would stand up from the ground and glare at the thugs without saying a word. The thugs, despite using all kinds of methods, could not make him yield in the face of this overseas Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This farce of fascist torture ended in failure.

    Days and Nights in the Den

    Chen Qiangshen often heard the interrogation and torture sounds of the thugs in the prison cell; he also often smelled the stench of rotting corpses. At this time, he calmly assessed his dangerous situation again. He thought that the Indonesian reactionaries were carrying out anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities, attempting to slander China and isolate China. This was a class struggle on an international scale. Class struggle is a struggle to the death, and there will always be bloodshed and sacrifice. Therefore, he made two mental preparations. One was to force the Indonesian reactionaries to release him through resolute struggle. He endured unbearable pain and continued to exercise. Every time he was allowed to "take a walk," he would go out for a stroll and do light chest-expanding exercises. The other preparation was that he recognized that he could not have any illusions about the enemy, so he once again made up his mind to be prepared to sacrifice his life. To express his love for Chairman Mao, the motherland, the people of the motherland, and the Indonesian people before his sacrifice, one night, he wrote the following sentences on a book he found in the prison cell with chalk: "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with revisionism!" "Youth is always beautiful, but true youth belongs only to the revolutionaries!" "Farewell, friends..." He wrote and wrote, unknowingly filling a thick book. That night, he felt extremely relieved and excited, and he stayed awake all night.

    Blood Debt Must Be Repaid with Blood!

    Just as Chen Qiangshen was fighting against the right-wing thugs day and night in the "KAMI" headquarters in Jakarta, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia made a serious protest to the relevant authorities in Indonesia, and the teachers and students of Chen Qiangshen's alma mater were also running around to rescue him. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, guilty and afraid, could not produce any evidence and finally had to release Chen Qiangshen.

    On the fifth day after Chen Qiangshen was kidnapped—March 22 in the afternoon—he was taken from the "KAMI" headquarters to the Fifth Military Region Command by the right-wing soldiers and released. When Chen Qiangshen left the "KAMI" headquarters, it was raining, and he was only wearing a pair of pants, with his upper body bare. When he asked for his shirt to be returned, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, fearing that their crimes would be exposed, dared not return Chen Qiangshen's blood-stained shirt to him.

    The teacher who came to greet him saw that Chen Qiangshen's body and face were covered with wounds, and he anxiously asked about his condition. However, Chen Qiangshen's first concern was not himself but the safety of the school and the teachers and students. His first words were: "Is the school safe?" "Are the students attending classes as usual?" Then, he hugged the teacher excitedly and shouted: "We must take revenge! We must take revenge! Blood debt must be repaid with blood!"

    Chen Qiangshen was immediately sent to the hospital. After examination, the doctor diagnosed him with severe injuries, internal bleeding in the chest, a broken jaw, and inability to close his mouth, with bruises all over his body. Chen Qiangshen was kept in Jakarta for treatment and rest for more than a month. During this period, although his body was very weak, he studied the works of Chairman Mao even more diligently. He once again read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and wrote down the following reflections with deep feelings: "Indeed, if one does not do things beneficial to the people and the motherland during one's lifetime, one will surely feel regret and shame one day." "I am determined to be an ordinary person, dedicating my life to the people and my youth to the motherland, inheriting the gun of the predecessors, and fighting for the glorious cause to the end."

    In mid-May this year, Chen Qiangshen returned to the embrace of the motherland. When he took the train from Guangzhou to Beijing, he was warmly welcomed at the station by Vice Chairman Lin Xiusi and Zhuang Mingli of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, responsible persons from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and representatives of Beijing's returned overseas Chinese. Chen Qiangshen's heroic deeds of remaining steadfast and unyielding in the face of severe torture and threat of death by the Indonesian reactionaries were highly praised by the welcomers. Vice Chairman Fang Fang, Zhuang Xiquan, and Huang Changshui of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission also received him. Fang Fang said to him, "Young people like Chen Qiangshen who love the motherland, defend the honor of the motherland, and are not afraid of violence are the pride of the vast number of overseas Chinese and the victory of Mao Zedong Thought." Chen Qiangshen humbly replied: "This is because there is a powerful socialist motherland as my backing and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. I have only done what I should have done. Compared to the anti-imperialist fighter Zhao Xiaoshou, I still have a long way to go." He expressed his determination to study the works of Chairman Mao better in the future, listen to Chairman Mao's words, obey the motherland's arrangements, and serve the people of the motherland and the people of the world for life.

    毛泽东思想给了他坚不可摧的力量
    ——记华侨青年陈强森同印度尼西亚右派斗争的英雄事迹
    编者按：二十一岁的华侨学生陈强森，身陷印尼反动派的血腥魔窟，饱受法西斯暴徒的严刑拷打，始终英勇不屈，坚持斗争，维护祖国的尊严和荣誉。他的事迹，充分表现了中国人民大无畏的英雄气概，受到祖国人民的赞扬和钦佩。
    是什么力量使得这位华侨青年这样正义凛然，坚不可摧？是对伟大祖国的无限热爱，是对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限信仰。
    陈强森是在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长起来的。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，使他懂得了革命道理，树立了为祖国和人民利益而奋斗的坚强决心与信念。因而，他能置生死于度外，坚持斗争到底。
    在这一场搏斗中，尽管印尼反动派张牙舞爪，下尽毒手，凶恶之至，但在陈强森的硬骨头面前，他们是败者，是弱者。陈强森的英勇斗争证明，有毛主席英明领导的强大祖国作为靠山的华侨，是不可侮的。印尼反动派在美帝国主义指使下疯狂地进行的反华排华暴行，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，加速它的末日的到来。
    被印度尼西亚右派反动组织“卡米”（印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织）绑架并非法监禁了五昼夜的华侨学生陈强森，最近从雅加达回到了祖国。他在暴徒的魔窟里遭到了严刑拷打和逼供，打得遍体鳞伤，牙床骨折断，但他英勇不屈，义正辞严地驳斥了右派暴徒的污蔑，维护了祖国的尊严和荣誉，使右派势力的阴谋不能得逞。经过我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的抗议和华侨团体的交涉，印度尼西亚右派势力最后不得不释放了他。
    陈强森以听毛主席的话作为自己的誓言，以毛主席教导的“为人民服务”作为自己的人生目的，在斗争中表现了坚不可摧的顽强意志。当印度尼西亚反动派对他进行疯狂迫害时，他以无穷的勇气和力量，把个人的生死完全置之度外，为维护祖国的荣誉而坚持斗争到底。他的事迹，对印度尼西亚受难的华侨是巨大的鼓舞。
    把右派暴徒的罪证记录下来
    三月十八日午后，几百名印度尼西亚武装军人和暴徒乘着十多辆汽车，突然闯到雅加达中华中学，向这所已有很长历史的华侨学校进行疯狂的袭击和破坏。当时站在校门口的高中三年级学生陈强森，对这种卑鄙野蛮的行径非常愤慨。为了抓住暴徒的罪证，他拿出本子把右派军人和暴徒乘坐的车辆号码全部记录下来。
    在街上巡逻的暴徒看见他记下汽车号码不禁着慌。一个穿黄色制服的暴徒突然冲过来勒住他的脖子，并且用匕首威胁他。另外几个暴徒也涌过来，他们抢走他的本子，又把他拖到一辆军车旁，暴徒向车上的四名戴蓝帽的军人报告说：他记下了我们的车辆号码，连亚尼将军（前印度尼西亚陆军司令）夫人的汽车号码也记下了。当时，立即有几个军人和暴徒气急败坏地把陈强森痛打了一顿。陈强森看出右派军人刚才惊慌失措的神态，他想起了毛主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，看穿了右派势力外强中干的本质。虽然右派暴徒对他拳脚交加，但他全身充满了战斗的力量和胜利的信心。
    接着，右派军人和暴徒不理会陈强森的抗议，把他绑架到另一辆汽车上，开往北华和侨众两所华侨学校进行破坏和抢掠，并把抢掠到的物品搬到车上带走。在车上，暴徒们一面围殴陈强森，一面逼问他：“那里还有华侨学校，给我们指路。”陈强森以鄙视的眼光扫射这些暴徒，斩钉截铁地回答道：“我不知道！”
    暴徒们破坏完这些华侨学校后，汽车经过美国大使馆的门前时，还恬不知耻地吹口哨和招手，向他们的主子报功。
    在车上的陈强森意识到自己遭到了绑架，一场严酷的斗争和考验摆在他的面前。这时，他想起了伟大领袖毛主席，想起了伟大的祖国和祖国的六亿五千万人民，他感到什么也不怕。他下定决心：一定要在这场斗争中坚持到底。
    头可断，绝不能向右派暴徒屈服
    傍晚，汽车驶进“卡米”的一个办事处。陈强森看到院子里正有一个蓝眼睛、高鼻子的西方人在吃晚餐。暴徒们把他们从华侨学校抢来的各种东西恭恭敬敬地交给了这个西方人，然后，几个暴徒将陈强森关进了一间阴森的房子里。陈强森知道这是一间刑讯室。怎样对付这些凶恶无情、蛮不讲理的暴徒？陈强森回想起他所读过的许多革命者在牢狱里跟敌人斗争的故事，最先想起的是《九颗红心向祖国》。他想：“我是一个华侨学生，从来没有违反印度尼西亚政府的法律，暴徒绑架我是非法的。正义在我这一边，有强大的社会主义祖国作靠山，没有什么可怕的！”
    暴徒首先强行搜身，抢走了陈强森的圆珠笔、拖鞋和现金。接着，他们指着墙上的血迹威胁说：“你看到那些血迹吗？你要老老实实地说。”他们又指着黑沉沉的窗外说：“外面就是坟墓。你不讲，就是这样下场！”有个暴徒甚至野蛮地说：“我已经好久没有‘吃’人了。”
    暴徒一开始就诬指陈强森是中国大使馆的“特务”。陈强森立即驳斥他们说，中国大使馆根本没有什么特务。他挺起胸膛说，“我是华侨学生。既然你们破坏我们的学校，我就有权利记下你们的罪证。你们这是给我枉加罪名，你们无权逮捕我！你们干的这些勾当是非法的，见不得人的！”暴徒问，“你是那里人？”陈强森回答说，“我是中国人！”暴徒们又挑衅地问他为什么不入印度尼西亚国籍，陈强森理直气壮回答说：“选择什么国籍是我的自由，也符合印度尼西亚的法律。你们无权干涉，我热爱我的祖国，也热爱印度尼西亚人民。”
    暴徒们从陈强森的嘴里捞不到什么东西，一个个气得暴跳如雷。他们象一群豺狼似的，有的拳打脚踢，有的用军用腰带、铁链、铁棍使劲抽打他。陈强森头部六处受伤，脸部青肿，牙床骨顿时被打断，鲜血不断从各处伤口流出来，上衣被染红了。他几次被打得昏了过去，又被暴徒们用冷水浇醒。后来，暴徒又扯开他的上衣，用烟头烫灼他的胸膛，用肥皂水灌他，还把他推倒在地，用军靴践踏他的胸部。
    暴徒一边拷打，一边叫嚷，强迫陈强森承认他是“中国大使馆的特务”。但是，刚满二十一岁的陈强森，在暴徒的残酷刑罚和死亡威胁面前，始终坚贞不屈。在这个过程中，他的脑海中始终萦回着毛主席在《为人民服务》一文中的一段话：“‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。陈强森对这段话不知阅读过多少遍，以至能够全部背诵出来。每阅读一遍，他都更加明确人生的目的，受到巨大的鼓舞。但是，他从来没有象今天这样深刻地体会到这句话的深刻意义；从来没有象今天这样，使他增加了雷霆万钧的力量。他又想起了自己在《毛泽东选集》里的毛主席象背后写下的自己的誓言：
    “毛主席，我爱您！
    毛主席，我是人民的儿子。
    我要为人民服务，
    为解放全人类，
    听您的话！”
    把自己的生死置之度外的陈强森，决心用自己的鲜血和生命来维护祖国的尊严和荣誉。每当他从昏迷中醒来时，他总是昂然地从地上爬起来，对暴徒怒目而视，一言不发。暴徒们在这位用毛泽东思想武装起来的华侨青年面前，尽管使尽了各种办法，丝毫不能使他屈服。这场严刑逼供的法西斯丑剧，就这样以失败而告终了。
    魔窟里的日日夜夜
    陈强森在囚室里不时听到暴徒的审问声和拷打声；还不时嗅到一阵阵腐尸的臭味。这时，他又一次冷静地估计了自己的险恶处境。他想，印度尼西亚反动派搞反华、排华，妄图诬蔑中国、孤立中国，这是一场国际范围内的阶级斗争。阶级斗争是你死我活的斗争，总是要流血、要牺牲的。因此，他做了两种思想准备。一种是经过坚决的斗争，迫使印度尼西亚反动派释放他。他忍受着难以忍受的剧痛，坚持锻炼身体。每次“放风”的时候，他都出来散步和做轻微的扩胸运动。另一种准备，他认识到对敌人决不能存有任何的幻想，因此，再一次下定了准备牺牲生命的决心。为了在牺牲前再一次抒发他对毛主席、对祖国、对祖国人民和印度尼西亚人民的热爱，一天晚上，他用粉笔在囚室里找到的一本书上写了这样的句子：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“中国和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒修正主义！”“青春啊永远是美丽的，可是真正的青春只属于革命者！”“永别了，朋友们……。”他写着写着，不知不觉把厚厚的一本书写满了。这一晚，他心头感到万分舒坦，而且激动和兴奋得彻夜不眠。
    血债要用血来还！
    正当陈强森日日夜夜地在雅加达“卡米”总部跟右派暴徒进行针锋相对的斗争的时候，中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚有关当局进行了严正的交涉，陈强森母校的老师和学生也在为营救他而奔走。印度尼西亚右派反动势力做贼心虚，拿不出任何证据，最后不得不释放了陈强森。
    陈强森被绑架后的第五天——三月二十二日下午，被右派军人从“卡米”总部带到第五军区司令部，予以释放。陈强森离开“卡米”总部的时候，天正下着雨，他身上只穿着一条裤子，上身赤膊。当他要求发回他的上衣时，印度尼西亚右派反动势力由于害怕暴露他们的罪证，不敢把陈强森血迹斑斑的上衣还给他。
    前来迎接他的老师，看到陈强森身上、脸部伤痕累累，关切地探问他的身体情况，但是陈强森首先关心的不是他自己，而是学校和老师、同学们的安全。他第一句话就问：“学校安全吗？”“同学们照常上课吗？”接着，他激动地抱着老师喊着：“要报仇！要报仇！血债要用血来还！”
    陈强森立即被送往医院，经过检查，医生诊断他身负重伤，胸有淤血，牙床骨被打断，上下颚无法合拢，遍体有被抽打的创伤。陈强森被留在雅加达治疗和休养了一个多月。在这期间，尽管他身体十分衰弱，却更加勤奋地学习毛主席著作。他又一次翻阅了《为人民服务》一文，深有感触地写下了如下的心得：“的确，生前不做有益人民有益祖国的事，总有一天自己会觉得悔恨和感到羞耻。”“我决心做一个平凡的人，把一生交给人民，把青春献给祖国，继承先辈的枪，为壮丽的事业奋斗到底。”
    今年五月中旬，陈强森回到了祖国的怀抱。当他坐火车从广州到达北京的时候，在车站上受到华侨事务委员会副主任林修德、庄明理，全国侨联、北京市侨联负责人以及北京市归侨代表的热烈欢迎。陈强森在印度尼西亚反动派严刑逼供和死亡威胁面前坚贞不屈的英雄事迹，受到了欢迎者的高度赞扬。华侨事务委员会副主任方方、庄希泉、黄长水等还接见了他。方方对他说，象陈强森这样热爱祖国、维护祖国荣誉和不怕强暴的好青年，是广大海外华侨的光荣，是毛泽东思想的胜利。陈强森谦虚地回答说：“这是因为有了强大的社会主义祖国做靠山，有了毛主席的英明领导，我只是做了我应该做的一点事。比起反帝战士赵小寿同志，我还差得很远。”他表示今后要更好地学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，服从祖国分配，为祖国人民和世界人民服务一辈子。
