    Shanghai workers' study-of-Chairman Mao's-writings pacesetters Cai Zuquan, Yang Fuzhen, Yang Huaiyuan, and the Honglei Group hold a discussion
    The Sharper the Class Struggle, the More We Must Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Writings in a Living Way
    Whether Chairman Mao's works have been truly learned well depends on whether they can be used in the class struggle, whether one can strike accurately and stand firm. In learning during struggle, one must first study and grasp Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle; in using during struggle, one must use the viewpoint of class and class struggle to identify the enemy and overthrow the enemy. Using means fighting. Exerting great effort on the word "use" is exerting great effort on the word "fight."
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th - The four pacesetters in Shanghai's working class in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings—Cai Zuquan, director of the Electric Light Source Laboratory of Fudan University and of worker origin; Yang Fuzhen, weaving machine operator at State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1; Yang Huaiyuan, deputy political commissar of the Democratic No. 5 ship and former service worker; and the Honglei Youth Group of the Synthetic Fiber Research Institute—recently stated at a forum: In the current upsurge of the vigorously developing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad working class must better study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful revolutionary weapon, charge forward in the Great Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, sweep away all demons and monsters, and overthrow all bourgeois "authorities." They said: The laboring people are the creators of history, and we must reverse the history that has been reversed by all exploiting classes!
    To Be Fearless Warriors in the Class Struggle,
    Use Mao Zedong Thought to Wash the Entire Earth Clean
    Cai Zuquan, Yang Fuzhen, Yang Huaiyuan, and the youth of the Honglei Group said at the forum: Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the creators of history and the masters of the country. We must manage, inquire about, and display the militant power of the proletariat in the current struggle between the bourgeois conspiracy to restore capitalism and the proletariat's counter-restoration! Cai Zuquan said:
  "Chairman Mao taught us long ago, 'After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight us to the death. We must never underestimate these enemies.' The large number of demons and monsters entrenched in the ideological and cultural front are enemies without guns, and they are fighting us to the death. In such a life-and-death class struggle, no one can say, 'It has nothing to do with me.' If the proletariat does not overthrow the bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie will rebel; if the bourgeoisie really restores capitalism, we proletarians will lose our heads!" Yang Fuzhen and Yang Huaiyuan then said in succession: Class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation are the three great revolutionary movements. Chairman Mao placed class struggle at the top of the three revolutionary movements, precisely to have us grasp this key link of class struggle in all our work. We must never only engage in the struggle for production and scientific experimentation without engaging in class struggle. Class struggle is an objective reality, and the class enemy is not reconciled to his own demise; if you do not defeat him, he will defeat you. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and never forget class struggle.
    They said: Making light bulbs, weaving cloth, doing good service work, and developing new synthetic fibers are all just parts of the revolutionary struggle. The class struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois is the major issue concerning the overall situation, the fate and future of our Party and country, and the most important matter concerning the world revolution. We must be thorough revolutionaries, we must be good students of Chairman Mao, and in class struggle, we should be fearless revolutionary warriors who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The youth of the Honglei Group and Cai Zuquan both believe: Our process of listening to Chairman Mao's words and making light bulbs and developing new synthetic fibers for the revolution is one filled with sharp and complex class struggle. Without giving prominence to politics, without firmly grasping class struggle, and without actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we would not have the strong courage and strength to engage in scientific experimentation, and we might have been overthrown by the bourgeois "authorities" long ago. If the proletariat does not overthrow all demons and monsters and thoroughly destroy the large and small "Three-Family Villages," and if capitalism is restored throughout the country, why should we make light bulbs or develop new synthetic fibers? Should we serve the bourgeoisie instead? Wouldn't the results of scientific experimentation instead be used by the class enemy to deal with our own laboring people? This is absolutely not allowed. They unanimously pointed out: The class enemy is not only afraid of us making light bulbs, weaving cloth, doing good service work, and developing new synthetic fibers for the revolution, but more importantly, they are afraid of us reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and carrying out class struggle in a big way according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must make revolution, we must study and master Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful revolutionary weapon, in class struggle to transform the world, and we must use Mao Zedong Thought to wash everything filthy on the earth clean!
    To Better Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Writings in a Living Way in Class Struggle,
    Conscientiously Learn and Constantly Improve the Skills of Class Struggle
    Learning in struggle and using in struggle is a basic experience of the four pacesetters, Cai Zuquan, etc., in studying Chairman Mao's writings. In the current high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they continue to use this experience, more earnestly studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way with the problems in the class struggle on the ideological and cultural front in mind, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, actively participating in the battle to smash the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, eradicate anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, and constantly improve their ideological awareness and fighting ability. They realized: The sharper and more complex the class struggle, the more we must study Chairman Mao's writings, and the more we can learn; and whether Chairman Mao's writings have been truly learned well depends on whether they can be used in the class struggle, whether one can strike accurately and stand firm. In learning during struggle, one must first learn and master Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle in this sharp and complex class struggle; in using during struggle, one must use the viewpoint of class and class struggle to identify the enemy and overthrow the enemy. Using means fighting. Exerting great effort on the word "use" is exerting great effort on the word "fight." They are determined to learn a little, use a little, learn while using, and not only fight against enemies with guns but also learn to fight against enemies without guns, conscientiously learn and constantly improve the skills of class struggle. They stated that they must firmly grasp the gun barrel and pick up the pen barrel to defend the seal of power.
    Cai Zuquan, Yang Fuzhen, Yang Huaiyuan, and the youth of the Honglei Group all spoke at the forum: Under the new situation of class struggle, the current offensive by a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements against us has new characteristics. They said: "We are facing extremely hidden and extremely cunning enemies. They have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, seized the leadership of some departments and units, opposed the red flag under the guise of the 'red flag,' worn masks, and launched batch after batch of poisonous arrows at the Party and socialism, killing people without using knives and without shedding blood. Their position is very intimidating to some people, their methods are very deceptive to some people, and they have launched a frenzied offensive against us in the ideological sphere, playing a role that enemies with guns cannot play. These enemies without guns must not be underestimated." They stated: "No matter what tricks the class enemy plays, the goal is only one: to seize our seal of power, to restore capitalism in China, and to ride on our heads again." They unanimously believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon. We must use this most powerful weapon in the class struggle to identify the reactionary faces of the class enemy and expose the enemy's conspiracies and tricks.
    How can we use the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to identify the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies without guns and sweep away all demons and monsters? The four study pacesetters, Cai Zuquan, etc., believe that, in summary, there are three main points: First, follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have a sense of the enemy situation in your mind at all times, never forgetting class struggle; second, follow Chairman Mao's instructions in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and master the six criteria for distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds and judging the right and wrong of speech and action; third, use Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly transform the world outlook, completely break with all old ideas, old concepts, old habits, and old traditions, and block the class enemy's "air-raid shelters."
    They said: Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again…till their doom; that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people’s cause, and they will never go against this logic." The class enemy will never lay down his butcher knife. The reason why they are adopting more hidden and cunning counter-revolutionary methods today is because the socialist revolution has developed in depth, and their counter-revolutionary tactics have also changed accordingly. Cai Zuquan, etc., pointed out: "Why did Deng Tuo's anti-Party black hand first reach for one-third of our 'spare' time? It is because they vainly attempt to break through this 'one-third' of 'spare' time to occupy the other 'two-thirds' of the time, vainly attempting to have us relax our revolutionary vigilance in this 'one-third' of the time and accept the bourgeois and revisionist toxins they spread with a 'relaxed mood'; vainly attempting to start from corrupting the 'one-third of life' of those whose revolutionary stand is not firm until they are completely corrupted. What they want is not just 'one-third' but 'three-thirds'. Dulles wanted to seize our third generation, and the Deng Tuo gang wanted to seize our 'one-third'. The goal is the same: to change the color of our country." They unanimously believe: "We must engrave Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle in our hearts like printing plates, have a sense of the enemy situation in our minds, and be vigilant against the enemy's attack on us at all times." Cai Zuquan, etc., said: "Our laboring people's standards ultimately come down to one. That is, love the Party, love Chairman Mao, love socialism, and love Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever opposes the Party, opposes Chairman Mao, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought is our enemy! No matter how high their position is, how great their power is, no matter what masks they wear, or what new tricks they play, their true colors will be revealed when they are illuminated by the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought."
    Everyone also talked about: The class enemy often uses those old ideas, concepts, habits, and traditions as their "hiding places" and "air-raid shelters." Only by firmly establishing the proletarian world outlook and constantly conducting criticism and self-criticism can we be good at identifying and eliminating the "ghosts" manifested in various forms and not give the class enemy any "hiding place."
    These four Shanghai pacesetters in studying Chairman Mao's writings emphasized in their speeches: Class struggle is intense and long-term. Today we have eradicated the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and another black line may appear tomorrow; today we have smashed the "Three-Family Village" gang, and another batch of gangs may appear tomorrow. However, as long as we study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, never forget class

    上海工人学习毛主席著作标兵蔡祖泉杨富珍杨怀远和红雷小组座谈
    阶级斗争越尖锐　越要活学活用毛主席著作
    毛主席著作是不是真正学好了，就看在阶级斗争中是不是用得上，打得准，过得硬。在斗争中学，首先就要学习和掌握毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说；在斗争中用，就是要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来识别敌人，斗倒敌人。用就是斗。在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是在“斗”字上狠下功夫。
    新华社上海十二日电　上海市工人阶级活学活用毛主席著作的四个标兵——复旦大学电光源实验室主任、工人出身的蔡祖泉，国棉一厂织布挡车工杨富珍，民主五号轮副政委、前服务员杨怀远和合成纤维研究所红雷青年小组，最近在一次座谈会上表示：在当前正在蓬勃开展的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，广大工人阶级一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的革命武器，在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，彻底粉碎反党反社会主义的黑线，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，打倒一 切资产阶级“权威”。他们说：劳动人民是历史的创造者，一定要把被一切剥削阶级颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来！
    要做阶级斗争中的大无畏的战士，
    用毛泽东思想把整个地球洗刷干净
    蔡祖泉、杨富珍、杨怀远和红雷小组的青年，在座谈会上说：工农兵是历史的创造者，是国家的主人。我们对当前正在开展的一场资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，一定要管，一定要问，一定要显示无产阶级的战斗威风！蔡祖泉说：
  “毛主席早就教导我们，‘在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。’盘踞在思想文化阵地上的大量牛鬼蛇神，就是不拿枪的敌人，就在和我们作拼死的斗争。在这样一场你死我活的阶级斗争当中，没有一个人能说‘与我无关’。无产阶级不打倒资产阶级，资产阶级就要造反；资产阶级真要复辟了，我们无产阶级就要人头落地！”杨富珍、杨怀远先后接着说：阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是三项伟大革命运动。毛主席把阶级斗争放在三项革命运动的头一项，就是要我们在一切工作中都要抓住阶级斗争这条纲。我们决不能只搞生产斗争和科学实验，不搞阶级斗争。阶级斗争是客观存在，阶级敌人是不甘心自己灭亡的，你不打垮他，他就打垮你。我们就是要听毛主席的话，永远不忘阶级斗争。
    他们说：造灯、织布、做好服务工作、搞新型合成纤维，都不过是革命斗争的一部分，兴无灭资的阶级斗争，才是关系全局的大问题，是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途、关系到世界革命的头等大事，我们要做一个彻底的革命者，我们要做毛主席的好学生，在阶级斗争中就应该是一个高举毛泽东思想红旗大无畏的革命战士。红雷小组的青年和蔡祖泉都认为：我们听毛主席的话，为革命造灯和搞新型合成纤维的过程，就是一个充满了尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的过程。不突出政治，不狠抓阶级斗争，不积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，我们搞科学实验就没有强大的勇气和力量，可能早就被资产阶级“权威”们搞垮了。如果无产阶级不打倒一切妖魔鬼怪，不彻底捣毁大大小小的“三家村”，资本主义在全国复辟了，我们还为什么造灯、为什么搞新型合成纤维呢？难道要我们为资产阶级服务吗？科学实验的成果不是反而要被阶级敌人用来对付我们劳动人民自己了吗？这是绝对不允许的。他们一致指出：阶级敌人不只是害怕我们为革命造灯、织布、做好服务工作、搞新型合成纤维，更主要的是害怕我们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示大搞阶级斗争。我们就是要革命，就是要在阶级斗争中学习和掌握毛主席思想这个最强大的革命武器来改造世界，就是要用毛泽东思想把地球上的一切乌七八糟的东西洗刷个干干净净！
    在阶级斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，
    认真学会和不断提高阶级斗争的本领
    在斗争中学，在斗争中用，是蔡祖泉等四个标兵学习毛主席著作的一条基本经验。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，他们继续运用这条经验，更加认真地带着思想文化战线上阶级斗争中的问题活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，积极参加捣毁“三家村”反党集团的战斗，铲除反党反社会主义的毒草，不断提高自己的思想觉悟和战斗能力。他们体会到：阶级斗争越是尖锐复杂，越是要学毛主席著作，也越是学得进；而毛主席著作是不是真正学好了，就看在阶级斗争中是不是用得上，打得准，过得硬。在斗争中学，首先就要在这一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中学习和掌握毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，在斗争中用，就是要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来识别敌人，斗倒敌人。用就是斗。在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是在“斗”字上狠下功夫。他们决心学一点，用一点，一边学，一边用，既要跟拿枪的敌人作斗争，更要学会跟不拿枪的敌人作斗争，认真学习和不断提高阶级斗争的本领。他们表示，一定要紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，保卫印把子。
    蔡祖泉、杨富珍、杨怀远和红雷小组青年，在座谈会上都谈到：在新的阶级斗争形势下，当前一小撮反党反社会主义分子对我们的进攻，具有新的特点。他们说：“我们面对着十分隐蔽、极为狡猾的敌人。他们钻进革命队伍内部，把持一些部门和单位的领导权，打着‘红旗’反红旗，戴着假面具，向党和社会主义发射了一批又一批的毒箭，杀人不用刀，杀人不见血。他们的地位很能吓唬一些人，他们的手法很能迷惑一些人，他们在意识形态领域内向我们发起猖狂的进攻，起着拿枪的敌人所不能起的作用。对于这些不拿枪的敌人，决不能小看。”他们表示：“不管阶级敌人玩弄什么花样，目的只是一个，那就是夺掉我们的印把子，让资本主义在中国复辟，他们重新骑在我们头上。”他们一致认为，毛泽东思想是最最锐利的武器。我们在阶级斗争中要用这个最强大的武器，识别阶级敌人的反动面目，戳穿敌人的阴谋诡计。
    怎样运用毛泽东思想的武器，去识别不拿枪的敌人的阴谋诡计，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神呢？蔡祖泉等四个学习标兵认为，归纳起来主要有三点：第一，遵循毛主席的教导，头脑里时时刻刻要有敌情观念，念念不忘阶级斗争；第二，按照毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中的指示，掌握辨别香花和毒草，判断言论和行动的是非的六条标准；第三，用毛泽东思想彻底改造世界观，同一切旧思想、旧观念、旧习惯、旧传统彻底决裂，堵塞阶级敌人的“防空洞”。
    他们说：毛主席说过：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”阶级敌人决不会放下屠刀，他们今天所以采取更加隐蔽、狡猾的反革命手法，是因为社会主义革命深入发展了，他们的反革命策略也跟着改变了。蔡祖泉等指出：“为什么邓拓的反党黑手，首先就伸向我们三分之一的‘业余’时间？就是因为他们妄想突破这‘三分之一’的‘业余’时间，来占领其他的‘三分之二’时间，妄想要我们在这‘三分之一’时间里，放松革命的警惕，‘以轻松的心情’，来接受他们散布的资产阶级、修正主义毒素；妄想从腐蚀那些革命立场不坚定的人的‘生命的三分之一’开始，直到全部被他们腐蚀掉。他们要的不止是‘三分之一’，而是‘三分之三’。杜勒斯要夺取我们的第三代，邓拓黑帮要夺取我们的‘三分之一’，目的是一个，都是要我们国家变颜色。”他们一致认为：“我们要把毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导象印板一样刻在心上，头脑里就有了敌情观念，就会随时随地警惕敌人对我们的进攻。”蔡祖泉等说：“我们劳动人民的标准，归根到底是一个。这就是热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，热爱毛泽东思想。谁反对党，反对毛主席，反对社会主义，反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们的敌人！不管他们地位有多高，权力有多大，不管他戴什么假面具，变什么新戏法，用毛泽东思想这面照妖镜一照，他们的原形就毕露了。”
    大家还谈到：阶级敌人还往往利用那些旧的思想、观念、习惯、传统，做他们的“隐蔽所”和“防空洞”。我们只有牢固地树立无产阶级的世界观，经常地进行批判和自我批判，才能善于识别和清除以各种形式表现出来的“阴魂”，不给阶级敌人以任何“藏身之地”。
    上海这四个学习毛主席著作的标兵在发言中强调指出：阶级斗争是剧烈而又长期的。今天我们铲除了反党反社会主义的黑线，明天还可能出现另外的黑线；今天我们捣毁了“三家村”黑帮，明天还可能有另一批黑帮。但是，我们只要活学活用毛主席著作，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，真正掌握住毛泽东思想中的一些最根本的观点，永远保持革命警惕，我们就能在任何时候识别任何敌人，打败任何敌人，就能把他们一个一个从最隐蔽的角落里揪出来，放在光天化日之下示众！
    敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢做、敢革命，
    把一切资产阶级“权威”打个落花流水
    蔡祖泉、杨富珍、杨怀远和红雷小组青年，怀着强烈的战斗激情，在座谈会上表示：毛主席鼓励我们：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”他们说：我们在党和毛主席的领导下，在这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，就是要敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢做、敢革命！蔡祖泉说：“一切牛鬼蛇神和资产阶级‘权威’总以为我们工农兵不懂历史，他们恶毒的借古讽今，恶毒的咒骂无产阶级专政，阴谋复辟。我们说：你们打错了算盘！历史是劳动人民创造的。我们劳动人民最懂得阶级斗争的历史。你们哪里是什么历史家，你们统统是政治阴谋家、个人野心家！”杨怀远说：“文化也是我们劳动人民创造的。谁说我们文化水平不高？我们活学活用毛主席著作，我们掌握毛泽东思想，我们就比一切资产阶级‘权威’都要高明千百万倍！”
    他们说：资产阶级“权威”在我们工农兵面前神气活现，摆出一副老爷的架势。其实，他们不过是“城隍庙里的泥菩萨”，气势汹汹，骨子里却虚弱得很，剥开来看，尽是稻草和烂泥。他们有的不过是资产阶级、修正主义的黑货，最大的本领就是做帝国主义、修正主义的应声虫。我们无产阶级有自己的权威，最大的权威就是毛主席，就是毛泽东思想。资产阶级“权威”再装腔作势，也吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民。
    在科学实验中有重大创造的蔡祖泉和红雷小组的青年，都联系自己的切身体会，激动地说：“我们靠毛泽东思想，天不怕，地不怕，早就同那些资产阶级‘权威’较量过了。资产阶级‘权威’并没有什么了不起，他们妄想长期霸占思想文化的阵地，垄断科学研究，这是绝对办不到的。”“敢于革命的工人是什么‘权威’也不怕的，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们勇往直前，一定要把一切资产阶级‘权威’打个落花流水。”
    他们还谈到，要在无产阶级文化大革命这一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争当中，更加认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示进一步改造世界观，实现思想革命化。他们认为，在无产阶级文化大革命当中，要大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，这对于我们每个人都是一个严重的考验。革命化，就是要在革命斗争中才能“化”。我们越是在革命斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，就越是能“化”得快，“化”得彻底；而越是加速思想革命化，就越是增强我们的战斗力，越是能在同阶级敌人作斗争中，发挥我们作为无产阶级文化大革命的主力军的作用。
    这四个标兵一致表示：我们工人阶级是毛泽东思想的卫士！保卫毛泽东思想，就是保卫我们的生命。我们热烈拥护党中央改组北京市委的英明决定，我们欢呼毛泽东思想的新胜利。我们决心做坚定的彻底的革命派，一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子照毛主席的指示办事，一辈子做保卫毛泽东思想的战士。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。谁敢反党反社会主义，谁敢动毛泽东思想一根毫毛，我们就要同他们拚，把他们统统砸成碎粉！
