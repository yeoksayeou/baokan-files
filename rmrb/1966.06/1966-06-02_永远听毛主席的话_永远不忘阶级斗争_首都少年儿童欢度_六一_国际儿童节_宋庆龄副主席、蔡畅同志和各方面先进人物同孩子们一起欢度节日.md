    Xinhua News Agency, 1st – The vast number of children in the capital joyfully celebrated "June 1st" International Children's Day today. The children expressed that they will always listen to Chairman Mao, be good children of Chairman Mao; resolutely join worker, peasant, and soldier uncles and aunts to thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party and anti-socialist big bad guys, never forget class struggle, and become firm successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling celebrated the holiday with children in the capital at the Beijing Children's Palace today. Also participating in the holiday activities were Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, as well as responsible persons from the Ministry of Education, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Ministry of Health, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Municipal People's Committee.

    The children of the capital, who are growing up healthily under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, wore new holiday clothes early this morning and rushed to various public places and schools to participate in various meaningful activities. The Capital Young Pioneers' celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day at the Beijing Workers' Stadium, with the participation of 15,000 Young Pioneers, was the center of activities throughout the city.

    Young friends from various countries in Beijing also celebrated the holiday with the children of the capital today.

    At the beginning of the celebration, a group of "Red Scarves" representatives from 1.67 million Young Pioneers across the city congratulated everyone on the holiday and all children in the country and the world. In the collective recitation of the congratulatory message, they said that when we celebrate the holiday, we feel boundless happiness and joy. However, we will never forget that class enemies are not reconciled to their demise. The "Three-Family Village," a group of big bad guys, cooperated with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to spread dark rumors, organized black gangs to oppose the Party, and plotted to change the country with conspiracies and tricks. They are still plotting against our children. These are all your delusions! We will pull out your black flags, smash your black lines, crush your black gangs, destroy your black dens, drag out all the monsters and demons, and thoroughly smash you! In their speech, they also firmly said that we Young Pioneers of the Mao Zedong era read Chairman Mao's books from an early age, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, do whatever Chairman Mao says, and are determined to be good children of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, we will always remember your words, study hard and make progress every day. Dear Chairman Mao, you are the great standard-bearer of the proletarian revolution, and thousands of Young Pioneers will always follow you. Dear Chairman Mao, you are the red sun in our hearts, and thousands of red scarves and red hearts are towards you and the Party.

    At the meeting, the Young Pioneers performed songs and dances reflecting their love for the great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "Be Good Children of Chairman Mao," "Communist Children's Corps," and "The East is Red." During the performance of the song and dance "Be Good Children of Chairman Mao," a Young Pioneer recited: "Chairman Mao's words are the most effective, we love Chairman Mao's words the most, Chairman Mao's words are all truth, teaching us to make revolution from an early age, to be good children of Chairman Mao, to be successors of the revolution." They also performed other programs reflecting the excellent revolutionary qualities of Chinese children, such as the chorus "Learn from Uncle Mai Xiande" and the song and dance "Little Militia." Each program received warm applause from the audience.

    Advanced figures from all fronts in the capital, outstanding teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, childcare workers, and educators from Beijing also celebrated the holiday with the children today.

    The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe, the Ballet Troupe of the Central Opera and Dance Drama Theatre, the Central National Song and Dance Ensemble, the Acrobatic Troupe of the China Railway Art Troupe, and the China Puppet Theatre Troupe performed programs for the Young Pioneers today.

    The Beijing Children's Palace, the Beijing Children's Science and Technology Museum, the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, and the children's homes in various districts simultaneously carried out holiday activities today. Thousands of children watched various cultural programs and sports performances and played various games in these places. More than 10,000 children watched military performances by commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army at the Children's Palace, and many children also performed songs and dances such as "Give the US Imperialists a Big Punch." Science and technology performances and aviation model performances organized by the Children's Science and Technology Museum attracted more than 20,000 children. At the Summer Palace, children and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army held a get-together. Many schools also held celebrations today.

    In recent days, many units in the city have carried out holiday activities.
