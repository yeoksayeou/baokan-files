    My Representative Attending the Bureau Standing Committee Institutional Subcommittee Meeting of the World Peace Council Delivers a Speech
    Opposing the Soviet Leaders' Peddling of the US Peace Talk Deception and Betrayal of the Vietnamese People's Conspiracy
    The Broadest and Most Genuine Anti-American International United Front Must Not Include the Lackeys and Accomplices of US Imperialism
    The Soviet Revisionist Leadership Group's So-called "Anti-War Front" Aims to Unite with US Imperialism to Extinguish the Flames of Revolution in Various Countries

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th of June. The Chinese representative attending the Bureau Standing Committee Institutional Subcommittee Meeting of the World Peace Council recently gave an interview to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, exposing the Soviet revisionists' manipulation of the leadership of the World Peace Council and their unscrupulous activities in coordinating with US imperialism in promoting the "peace talk" deception on the Vietnam issue.
    The Subcommittee meeting was held in Berlin from May 14th to 15th. Representatives from more than a dozen countries, including China, Guinea, Algeria, the United Arab Republic, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Belgium, and India, attended the meeting.
    The Chinese representative pointed out that on the eve of the meeting, the leadership of the World Peace Council distributed to various countries a blue paper entitled "The Focus of the World—Vietnam," which openly put forward five "preconditions" for a "negotiated settlement" of the Vietnam issue. These "preconditions" were obviously carefully planned by the Soviet revisionists in an attempt to further peddle Johnson's "peace talk" conspiracy. These five "preconditions" are:
    "Not to continue bombing North Vietnam.
    "Recognizing that the National Liberation Front (of South Vietnam) is the only legitimate negotiating partner. The current Saigon government, like the two puppet governments of Bao Dai established by France and maintained by the United States, cannot represent the people. It is inconceivable that the US government should make its recognition of the National Liberation Front dependent on the 'goodwill' of that puppet government.
    "The US government should make an unambiguous statement about the withdrawal of troops and war materials and actually begin the withdrawal, and guarantee that this withdrawal will be completed. Relevant countries, including the People's Republic of China, will meet in Geneva to negotiate to provide this guarantee, as was the case in concluding the 1954 Geneva Accords.
    "Immediately end all threats and immediately stop increasing US loans, troops and war materials in Vietnam.
    "Self-determination for South Vietnam. The issue of reunification and foreign policy is an internal affair of the government that the people of South Vietnam will freely establish."
    The Chinese representative pointed out that with a little analysis, it is not difficult to see that these five "preconditions" are a major conspiracy to betray the Vietnamese people. It is very clear that the key to solving the Vietnam issue is the immediate and complete withdrawal of US aggressor troops from South Vietnam, but this document does not mention it at all.
    The so-called "preconditions" for resolving the Vietnam issue in the document are closely coordinated with the US government's conspiracy in every aspect. The US government has repeatedly played the trick of "suspending bombing," and the World Peace Council document, manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, proposes "not to continue bombing North Vietnam." The US says "it is not difficult for the Viet Cong to make its opinions heard," and the document describes the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, as a "negotiating partner." The US is playing tricks such as "negotiating before withdrawal," "negotiating while withdrawing," and "symbolic troop withdrawal," which in reality means never withdrawing, and the document proposes that the US only needs to "begin the withdrawal" and "stop increasing" US troops and war materials in Vietnam in order to legalize the continued presence of US aggressor troops in South Vietnam. The US's "unconditional negotiation" conspiracy has repeatedly failed, and the document proposes to reconvene the Geneva Conference and attempts to drag China into it to participate in "guaranteeing." The US says that South Vietnam is under "threat" from North Vietnam, and the document echoes this by saying "immediately end all threats." The US attempts to split Vietnam, and the document also attempts to obstruct the Vietnamese people from reunifying their motherland under the guise of South Vietnamese "self-determination" and "internal affairs." This document also specifically opposes China and viciously provokes the anti-imperialist solidarity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.
    In the final analysis, these negotiation "preconditions" are designed to deceive into a "peace talk" situation that can be prolonged indefinitely, thereby helping US imperialism to obtain what it cannot obtain on the battlefield, allowing it to stay in South Vietnam for a long time and permanently split Vietnam. This is the most blatant program of the Soviet revisionist leadership group to betray the Vietnamese people. This is a great insult to the heroic Vietnamese people.
    The Chinese representative pointed out that, in fact, peddling the above-mentioned "peace talk" proposals has been the central activity of the World Peace Council in recent times. As early as during the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council Presidium in March of this year, a so-called statement that "the Americans should go to Geneva to negotiate" had already emerged. Now it has been decided to hold the World Peace Council meeting in Geneva, and to hold an international rally there on the twelfth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords on July 20, etc. All of this is the product of US-Soviet collusion to "reconvene the Geneva Conference." The Soviet leaders are trying their best to make the June World Peace Council meeting a meeting to peddle the US "peace talk" fraud, a meeting where the US and the Soviet Union collude and unite with reactionaries from various countries to betray the Vietnamese people and oppose China. The political conspiracy of US imperialism and its accomplices—modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership group—is obvious to anyone with discerning eyes. The Chinese people are determined to thoroughly expose it!
    The Chinese representative also revealed that at this meeting, in the process of drafting documents related to the World Peace Council meeting to be held in June, the Soviet representative also tried his best to promote the revisionist foreign policy line of the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, promoting the so-called "front of war opponents," in an attempt to lead the world peace movement away from the path of resolutely struggling against US imperialism and its lackeys, and into the orbit of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world."
    The Chinese representative pointed out that the draft appeal for cooperation among peace forces put forward at this meeting does not mention the struggle of the people of various countries against imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States, nor does it mention support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist US aggression and save the country, but vigorously promotes the indiscriminate "anti-war" proposition, saying that "preventing war" is "the most important issue," and advocating taking "joint actions" to "block the passage to war." The document also attempts to continue to impose so-called "peaceful coexistence" and "complete and thorough disarmament" on the peace movement as "basic principles."
    The Chinese representative spoke at the meeting and strongly opposed the draft appeal. He said that the presentation of this document is a serious step by the Soviet leaders to further betray the cause of the world's people against imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace, and is also another proof that they are using the World Peace Council as a tool of their national foreign policy.
    The Chinese representative pointed out that the purpose of the so-called "cooperation of various peace forces" is to link the World Peace Council with the United Nations, an instrument of aggression controlled by US imperialism, to incorporate the activities of the peace movement into the orbit of the United Nations, and to promote the line of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" in the peace movement.
    The Chinese representative then pointed out that the various "anti-war" propositions in the document are nothing more than a replica of the so-called "front of war opponents" put forward by the Soviet revisionist leadership group at the 23rd Congress of the CPSU. He said that it is wrong to talk vaguely about maintaining world peace and opposing war. To defend world peace, it is necessary to oppose the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States. The Chinese people have always advocated that all countries and peoples subjected to US aggression, control, interference, and bullying should unite and form the broadest, not narrow, and the most genuine, not false, anti-American united front. This united front certainly cannot include the lackeys and accomplices of US imperialism. The Chinese representative listed facts to expose the Soviet leaders' single-minded pursuit of joint action with US imperialism and undermining the revolutionary struggles of various countries. He emphasized that China and the revolutionary people of various countries absolutely cannot engage in any "joint action" with the Soviet revisionist leadership group, which has degenerated into an accomplice of US imperialism. The "anti-war front" proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership group is opposed to the international anti-American united front, and its purpose is to unite with US imperialism and reactionaries from various countries to extinguish the flames of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of various countries.
    The Chinese representative also mentioned that at the meeting, some representatives from African countries also disagreed with the contents of the draft document. They pointed out that the document should add content on the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism. The draft document was not adopted at the meeting.
    The meeting also discussed documents on the organizational structure of the World Peace Council. This document was designed to facilitate the Soviet revisionists' strengthening of control within the World Peace Council and wielding of the baton. It aroused objections and dissatisfaction from many representatives. The discussion descended into chaos. The meeting also failed to reach a consensus on this issue and ended in a hasty conclusion.
    The Chinese representative finally told the Xinhua News Agency reporter that US imperialism has fallen into the heavy encirclement of the people of the world and is heading towards its demise. The Soviet revisionists are wholeheartedly serving it and can only increasingly expose their traitorous faces of being enemies of the people of the world. They will never have a good end.

### 反对苏联领导兜售美国和谈骗局出卖越南人民的阴谋

    我出席世界和平理事会主席团机构小组委员会议的代表发表谈话
    反对苏联领导兜售美国和谈骗局出卖越南人民的阴谋
    最广泛最真实的反美国际统一战线决不能把美帝国主义的走狗和帮凶包括在内
    苏联修正主义领导集团所谓的“反战阵线”是要联合美帝扑灭各国人民革命烈火
    新华社八日讯　出席世界和平理事会主席团机构小组委员会会议的中国代表最近对新华社记者发表谈话，揭露苏联修正主义者操纵世界和平理事会领导机构，在越南问题上肆无忌惮地配合美帝国主义搞“和谈”骗局的罪恶活动。
    小组委员会会议是在五月十四日到十五日在柏林举行的。出席会议的有中国、几内亚、阿尔及利亚、阿联、英国、法国、苏联、比利时、印度等十几个国家的代表。
    中国代表指出，就在这次会议开会的前夕，世界和平理事会领导机构向各国散发了一个题为《世界的焦点——越南》的蓝皮文件，公然提出关于“谈判解决”越南问题的五点“前提”。这些“前提”显然是苏联修正主义者精心策划的，妄图进一步贩卖约翰逊的“和谈”阴谋。这五点“前提”是：
    “不继续轰炸北越。
    “承认（南越）民族解放阵线是唯一合法的谈判伙伴。目前的西贡政府，同法国所树立而为美国所维持的保大两届傀儡政府一样，不能代表人民，美国政府要把对民族解放阵线的承认，取决于那个傀儡政府的‘善意’，是不可想象的。
    “美国政府毫不含糊地作出关于撤退军队与战争物资的声明，并真的开始进行撤退，而且保证将会完成这一撤退行动。有关国家，其中包括中华人民共和国，将在日内瓦开会谈判来给予这种保证，正如缔结一九五四年日内瓦协议的情况一样。
    “立即终止一切威胁，立即终止增加美国在越南的贷款、军队和战争物资。
    “南越自决。关于重新统一和外交政策的问题，是南越人民将要自由建立的政府的内部事务。”
    中国代表指出，人们稍加剖析，就不难看出，这五点“前提”，是一个出卖越南人民的大阴谋。事情非常清楚，解决越南问题的关键是美国侵略军立即全部撤出南越，而这个文件中对此却只字不提。
    文件中的所谓解决越南问题的“前提”，条条项项都是同美国政府的阴谋紧密配合的。美国政府一再玩弄“暂停轰炸”的讹诈手段，苏联修正主义者操纵的世界和平理事会的文件就提出“不继续轰炸北越”。美国说“越共不难使它的意见让人听到”，文件就把南越人民唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线说成是“谈判的伙伴”。美国在玩弄所谓“先谈后撤”、“边谈边撤”和“象征性撤军”等阴谋，实际上就是永远不撤，文件就提出美国只要“开始进行撤退”和“终止增加”美国在越南的军队和战争物资，以便让目前在南越的美国侵略军继续赖在那里合法化。美国的“无条件谈判”阴谋一再破产，文件就提出重新召开日内瓦会议，并妄想把中国套进去，参与“保证”。美国说南越受到北越的“威胁”，文件就呼应说“立即终止一切威胁”。美国企图分裂越南，文件也就在南越“自决”、“内政”等幌子下企图阻挠越南人民重新统一祖国。这个文件还指名反华，恶毒地挑拨中越两国人民的反帝团结关系。
    归根结蒂，这些谈判“前提”，是要骗出一个可以无限期拖下去的“和谈”局面，从而帮助美帝国主义取得它在战场上所得不到的东西，让它长期赖在南越，永久分裂越南。这是苏联修正主义领导集团最露骨地出卖越南人民的纲领。这是对英勇的越南人民的莫大侮辱。
    中国代表指出，事实上，兜售上述“和谈”主张，正是世界和平理事会最近一个时期以来的中心活动内容。早在今年三月世界和平理事会主席团布达佩斯会议期间，就已经冒出了一个所谓要让“美国人到日内瓦去谈判”的声明。现在又选定到日内瓦去开世界和平理事会会议，并且还要在七月二十日日内瓦协议签订十二周年之际在那里举行什么国际集会等等。这一切都是美苏合谋“重新召开日内瓦会议”的产物。苏联领导人正在千方百计地使六月世界和平理事会会议，成为一次兜售美国“和谈”骗局的会议，一次美苏勾结，并联合各国反动派出卖越南人民和反对中国的会议。美帝国主义及其帮凶——以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义这种政治阴谋，明眼人一看便知。中国人民决心要把它彻底戳穿！
    中国代表还揭露说，在这次会议上，在草拟有关将在六月召开的世界和平理事会会议的文件的过程中，苏联代表还竭力推销苏共二十三大的修正主义对外路线，宣扬所谓“战争反对者阵线”的主张，妄图使世界和平运动背离同美帝国主义及其走狗作坚决斗争的道路，而纳入“美苏合作主宰世界”的轨道。
    中国代表指出，在这次会议上端出的关于和平力量合作的呼吁书草案，只字不提各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，也不提支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，却大力兜售不分是非的“反战”主张，说“防止战争”是“最首要的问题”，鼓吹采取“联合行动”来“阻挡通向战争的通路。”文件还企图继续把所谓“和平共处”、“全面彻底裁军”强加给和平运动作为“基本原则”。
    中国代表在会上发言，强烈反对这个呼吁书草案。他说，这个文件的提出，是苏联领导人进一步背叛世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平事业的一个严重步骤，也是他们把世界和平理事会作为一国的外交政策工具的又一证明。
    中国代表指出，所谓“各种和平力量合作”的目的是要使世界和平理事会同美帝国主义控制的侵略工具联合国挂钩，把和平运动的活动纳入联合国的轨道，在和平运动中推行“美苏合作主宰世界”的路线。
    中国代表接着指出，文件中的各种“反战”主张无非是苏联修正主义领导集团在苏共二十三大上提出的所谓“战争反对者阵线”的翻版。他说，笼统地讲维护世界和平、反对战争是错误的。要保卫世界和平，必须反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。中国人民一贯主张所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺侮的国家和人民联合起来，结成一条最广泛而不是狭隘的、最真实而不是虚伪的反美统一战线。这条统一战线当然不能把美帝国主义的走狗和帮凶包括在内。中国代表列举事实，揭露苏联领导人一心同美帝国主义搞联合行动，破坏各国人民的革命斗争。他强调说，中国和各国革命人民绝对不能同已经堕落为美帝国主义帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团搞什么“联合行动”。苏联修正主义领导集团所提出的“反战阵线”是同国际反美统一战线相对抗的，其目的是要联合美帝国主义和各国反动派扑灭各国人民反帝革命斗争的烈火。
    中国代表还谈到，在会上，有些非洲国家代表也不同意文件草案内容。他们指出，文件应该增加亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义反对殖民主义斗争的内容。这个文件草案在会上没有通过。
    会议还讨论了关于世界和平理事会的组织机构的文件，这个文件是为了便于苏联修正主义者在世界和平理事会内加强控制，挥舞指挥棒服务的。它引起了许多代表的异议和不满。讨论陷入一片混乱之中。会议对此也没有达成一致意见，最后草草收场。
    中国代表最后对新华社记者说，美帝国主义已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中，正在走向灭亡。苏联修正主义者一心一意为它效劳，只能越来越暴露出自己与世界人民为敌的叛徒嘴脸，他们也决不会有什么好下场的。
