    Tirana's People Enthusiastically Prepare to Welcome Our Party and Government Delegation
    Broad Masses of Workers and Agricultural Cooperative Members Determined to Greet the Envoys of the Chinese People with Outstanding Production Achievements
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 23rd (Dispatch from our correspondent) The residents of Tirana, the capital of Albania, are preparing with friendly and joyful passion to warmly welcome the envoys of the Chinese people – the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council.
    The entire city of Tirana has been adorned in festive attire. On the building of the Tirana City People's Council Executive Committee, located in Skanderbeg Square in the city center, hang giant portraits of the great leaders of the Chinese and Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. On the opposite Trade Ministry building, hang giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. On other tall buildings, hang portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Zhu De, and Albanian Party and Government leaders such as Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu.
    All the streets and lanes and buildings along the streets in Tirana are flying the national flags of Albania and China and brightly colored flags. At the entrance to Permet Street, where the Chinese Party and Government Delegation will pass, a tall archway has been erected, with a huge banner hanging on it reading "Welcome Esteemed Guests!" Along the thoroughfare leading to the delegation's residence, which is seven or eight kilometers long, are huge banners spanning the streets, reading: "Long Live the Eternal Friendship of the Chinese and Albanian Peoples!" "Long Live the Communist Party of China Headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Albanian Party of Labor Headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" "There Can Be No Victorious Opposition to Imperialism Without Thoroughly Exposing Revisionism!" These slogans express the ironclad unity of China and Albania, the two parties and the two peoples, and the fighting will to carry the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and its running dogs and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership to the end.
    Since the good news was announced that Comrade Zhou Enlai would lead the Chinese Party and Government Delegation on its third visit to Albania, the people of Tirana have been preparing day and night with joy and excitement to warmly welcome the envoys of the Chinese people. They regard this welcome as a grand demonstration of the great friendship and militant unity of the Chinese and Albanian parties, countries, and peoples in the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism.
    In recent days, workers and staff of factories, government offices, and enterprises, and students of schools throughout the city have been making colorful decorations, flags, propaganda posters, and slogan boards with deep affection, preparing to solemnly welcome their Chinese comrades-in-arms from the center of the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism, from the center of world revolution. The female workers of the Stalin Textile United Factory continued to work after getting off work without going home. Within a few days, they made five thousand bouquets of colorful flowers, six thousand red flags, two hundred giant silk banners, forty banners with fighting slogans, and a large number of slogan boards. Each workshop held photo exhibitions introducing the achievements of the Chinese people and showcasing Sino-Albanian friendship. Osman Çaze, the labor party branch secretary of the "Sino-Albanian Friendship" class of this factory, said: "When Comrade Zhou Enlai visited Albania for the first time, he spent the Lunar New Year's Eve with the workers of our Stalin Textile United Factory. This has become a major event that we will never forget. Our class is not only preparing to personally greet him with great enthusiasm, but also to present him with better labor achievements as a tribute of welcome. In the past week, we have overfulfilled the plan by 3.5 percent every day. This is our way of welcoming the Chinese Party and Government Delegation."
    The broad masses of members of the agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of the capital, although in the midst of the busy wheat harvest season, immediately joined the upsurge of preparing to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. The news that the Chinese Party and Government Delegation was about to visit Albania inspired the members' enthusiasm.
    The "New China" Agricultural Production Cooperative originally planned to end the wheat harvest on July 5th. However, encouraged by the news that Comrade Zhou Enlai was about to visit, the members put forward the slogan "Harvest Quickly, Thresh Quickly to Welcome Distinguished Guests," and decided to work day and night to rush the harvest, striving to complete the wheat harvest by June 23rd. The agricultural cooperative's 1,500 male and female members will greet the Chinese friends with the joy of the wheat harvest victory. Ibrahim Marlo, the chairman of the agricultural cooperative, told the Xinhua News Agency reporter: "In order to express their deep friendship with the Chinese people, the members also painstakingly built an eye-catching white slogan with stones on a hillside not far from the cooperative, where the delegation will pass by: 'Welcome Chinese Guests!' 'Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian Peoples!'"
    In order to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests, the literary and art workers of Tirana immediately mobilized. The painters of the "House of Artists" painted thirty giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Chairman Zhu De in a very short time; they rushed to make more than 1,000 large national flags of Albania and China and more than 200 huge banners with fighting slogans written in Albanian and Chinese. "Painter Halmi Hoxha, with boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao, worked for two days and nights to paint ten giant portraits of Chairman Mao. He said, 'Comrade Zhou Enlai is coming to Albania for a visit shortly after the Albanian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Shehu visited China. This is a great event. When I think of the great political significance of this visit, and that this visit will further enhance the friendship between our two peoples, my enthusiasm comes.'" More than 250 cultural organizations, groups, and amateur cultural organizations throughout the city are enthusiastically rehearsing various literary and art programs. More than 1,000 literary and art workers and 1,500 athletes will perform wonderful programs in Skanderbeg Square to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.
    At night, the entire city of Tirana is brightly lit, and neon slogans specially made to welcome the Chinese brothers are shining brightly on tall buildings, showing the great friendship of the Chinese and Albanian parties, countries, and peoples. Amplifiers are broadcasting songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "Tirana-Beijing," "Socialism is Good," "One Hand Holds a Pick, One Hand Holds a Gun," and "Song of the Guerrillas." The entire city is filled with a festive scene, filled with the friendship of proletarian internationalism, and everywhere cheering the close combat unity of the Chinese and Albanian parties, countries, and peoples.

    到处充满无产阶级国际主义情谊到处欢呼阿中两国人民战斗团结
    地拉那人民热烈准备欢迎我党政代表团
    广大工人和农业社社员决心以优异的生产成就迎接中国人民使者
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　本社记者报道：阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那的居民正怀着友谊和欢乐的激情，热烈准备欢迎中国人民的使者——由中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团。
    地拉那全市已经披上了节日的盛装。位于全市中心斯坎德培广场上的地拉那市人民会议执行委员会的大楼上，悬挂着中阿两国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和恩·霍查同志的巨幅画象。对面的贸易部大楼上悬挂着马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的巨幅画象。在另外一些高大建筑物上，挂着毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、周恩来总理、朱德委员长和霍查同志、谢胡同志等阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人的画象。
    地拉那市的所有大街小巷和街道两旁的建筑物上，都飘扬着阿中两国的国旗和鲜艳的彩旗。在准备夹道欢迎中国党政代表团的佩尔梅特大街的入口处，搭起了一座高大的牌楼，上面悬挂着“欢迎敬爱的贵宾！”的巨大横幅。在长达七、八公里的、通向代表团驻地的通衢大道上，挂满了巨大的跨街横幅，上面写着：“阿中两国人民的永恒友谊万岁！”“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！”“以恩·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“不彻底揭露修正主义就不能胜利地反对帝国主义！”等口号。这些口号表达了阿中两国、两党和两国人民的钢铁般的团结和把反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底的战斗意志。
    自从周恩来同志将率领中国党政代表团第三次访问阿尔巴尼亚的喜讯公布以后，地拉那人民就以欢欣鼓舞的心情，夜以继日地进行准备，以便热烈地欢迎中国人民的使者。他们把这一欢迎当作阿中两党、两国和两国人民在反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义斗争中的伟大友谊和战斗团结的一次大示威。
    这些天来，全市各工厂、机关、企业的职工和学校的学生们都在满怀深情地赶扎彩花，赶制旗帜、宣传画、标语牌等，准备隆重欢迎来自反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争中心、来自世界革命中心的中国战友。斯大林纺织联合工厂的女工们下班后仍不回家，几天之内就赶制出了五千束彩色缤纷的花束、六千面红旗和二百面巨幅锦旗，以及四十幅写着战斗口号的横幅和大量的标语牌。每个车间都举办了介绍中国人民的成就、表现中阿友谊的图片展览。这个厂的
  “阿中友好”班的劳动党支部书记奥斯曼·恰泽说：“周恩来同志第一次访问阿尔巴尼亚时，曾经和我们斯大林纺织联合工厂的工人一起欢度了除夕。这成了我们永志不忘的一件大事。我们班不仅准备满怀热情地亲自去迎接他，而且还要以更好的劳动成就作为欢迎他的献礼。最近一周来，我们每天都是超额百分之三点五完成计划。这就是我们欢迎中国党政代表团的心意”。
    首都郊区农业生产合作社的广大社员虽然正在麦收大忙季节，也立即卷入了准备欢迎中国贵宾的热潮。中国党政代表团即将访问阿尔巴尼亚的消息鼓舞了社员们的干劲。
  “新中国”农业生产合作社原计划在七月五日结束麦收。但是，在周恩来同志即将来访的消息的鼓舞下，社员们提出了“快收、快打迎贵宾”的口号，决定夜以继日地抢收，争取在六月二十三日完成麦收。农业社的一千五百名男女社员将带着麦收胜利的欢欣去迎接中国友人。农业社的主席易卜拉欣·马洛对新华社记者说：“社员们为了表达对中国人民的深情厚谊，还在离合作社不远的代表团将要路过的一个山坡上用石头精心砌成醒目的白色标语：“欢迎中国贵宾！”“中阿两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”
    为了迎接中国贵宾，地拉那的文艺工作者立即动员起来，“艺术家之家”的画家们在很短的时间内就绘制出了三十幅毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席、周恩来总理和朱德委员长的巨幅画象；赶制出了一千多面大型的阿中两国国旗和二百多幅写有阿中两国文字的战斗口号的巨大横幅。“画家哈尔米·霍查怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬的心情，在两昼夜赶画出十幅毛主席的巨幅画象。他说，“周恩来同志在以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国之后不久，就前来阿尔巴尼亚访问，这是一件了不起的大事。我一想到这次访问的重大政治意义，想到这次访问将更进一步增强我们两国人民的友谊，我的劲头就来了。”全市二百五十多个文化机关、团体和业余文化组织正在热情地赶排各种文艺节目。一千多名文艺工作者和一千五百名运动员将在斯坎德培广场上表演精采节目，欢迎中国贵宾。
    入夜，地拉那全市灯火通明，为欢迎中国兄弟特制的霓虹灯标语，在高大的建筑物上闪闪发光，显示出阿中两党、两国和两国人民的伟大的友谊。扩音机播送着《大海航行靠舵手》、《地拉那—北京》、《社会主义好》、《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》、《游击队之歌》的歌声。全市到处是节日般的欢腾景象，到处充满着无产阶级国际主义的情谊，到处在欢呼阿中两党、两国和两国人民亲密无间的战斗团结。（附图片）
