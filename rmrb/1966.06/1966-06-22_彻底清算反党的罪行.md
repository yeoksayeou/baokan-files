    Thoroughly Liquidate the Anti-Party Crimes
    The author of "Sailing Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" portrays the counter-revolutionary loafer, the "Anti-Communist Vengeance Army" element, as an elusive "warrior." You desperately promote counter-revolutionary activities; your belly full of bad intentions cannot escape the discerning eyes of the people. The day of thorough liquidation has arrived. The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the ability to distinguish all poisonous weeds and the power to sweep away all monsters and demons. Since you want to incite the overthrown landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and all class enemies to emerge and rebel, since you want to act as trumpeters for counter-revolutionary restoration, then stand up and compete. The iron fists of the revolutionary people will not spare you!
    Zhu Guang, Educated Youth Sent-Down to the Countryside, Qutou Brigade, Yongledian Farm, Tongxian County, Beijing

    彻底清算反党的罪行
    《逆风千里》的作者，把反革命娄罗，“反共复仇军”分子，塑造成神出鬼没的“勇士”。你们拼命地为反革命活动张扬，你们一肚子的坏水，是瞒不过人民群众雪亮眼睛的。现在彻底清算的日子到了。毛泽东思想武装下的人民群众，有辨别一切毒草的能力和横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的威力。你们既然要煽动被打倒的地、富、反、坏分子和一切阶级敌人出笼造反，你们既然要为反革命复辟充当吹鼓手，那末，你们就站出来较量较量吧。革命人民的铁拳是饶不了你们的！
