    "Coal" on the "Locomotive"
    Beijing Radio Factory No. 2　Liu Zongming
    The locomotive pulls dozens of carriages, crosses high mountains, and spans rivers, flying thousands of miles in an instant, truly possessing an inexhaustible vigor.
    What is the source of the locomotive's power? It is the heat energy produced by the burning of coal. Railway workers often say: "Coal is the treasure of treasures." Without it, the locomotive cannot move forward; without it, the locomotive cannot pull the carriages.
    A revolutionary, in a sense, is also like a "locomotive." This "locomotive," to fly fast, charge fiercely, and carry much on the road of revolution, equally needs "coal." This spiritual "coal" is Mao Zedong Thought. The great communist fighter Ouyang Hai said: "The locomotive relies on coal and water to drive the carriages; people need to read Chairman Mao's books more to have strength." Mao Zedong Thought, for a revolutionary, is as important as "coal" on the "locomotive."
    If the locomotive is to advance forever on the road of revolution, never decelerating, it is not enough to add coal once; instead, it must be added constantly, incessantly. A revolutionary can only advance forever by constantly, frequently, and repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works.
    If adding coal to the locomotive is just filling it in shovel by shovel without making it burn, then no matter how much is filled, it will be difficult to move an inch. Because without burning, it cannot generate heat, it will not produce kinetic energy, and it will not be able to move forward. If a person studies Chairman Mao's works by simply reading them article by article, learning without applying, and not using them to fight the "ego," even if they learn a lot, it will be of no avail. Because without "struggle," the "cold air" in the thoughts cannot be removed, and the enthusiasm for revolution cannot be "ignited."
    The reason why Ouyang Hai was able to become a great communist fighter lies in his ability to constantly study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual "coal," generated infinite power in his heart.

### “火车头”上的“煤”

    “火车头”上的“煤”
    北京无线电二厂　刘宗明
    火车头，拉着几十节车厢，跨高山，越江河，顷刻之间，飞出千里之外，身上真有一股使不完的劲头。
    火车头力量的源泉是什么呢？是煤的燃烧产生的热能。铁路工人常说：“煤是宝中宝”。没有它，火车头便不能前进；没有它，火车头就带不动车厢。
    一个革命者，从某种意义上说，也正象一个“火车头”。这个“火车头”，要在革命的道路上，飞得快、闯得猛，载得多，同样少不了“煤”。这个精神上的“煤”，就是毛泽东思想。伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海说：“火车头靠煤、靠水才能带动车厢，人要多读毛主席的书才有力量。”毛泽东思想，对一个革命者来说，正象“火车头”上的“煤”一样重要。
    火车头要在革命的道路上永远前进，永不减速，光靠一次加煤是不行的，而是要不断地加煤，不停地加煤。一个革命者，只有不断学、经常学、反复学习毛主席著作，才能永远前进。
    往火车头中加煤，如果只是一铲一铲填进去，并不使其燃烧，那么，填得再多，它也是寸步难行的。因为不燃烧，就不能发热，就不会产生动能，就无法前进。一个人学习毛主席著作，如果只是一篇一篇读一读，学而不用，不拿它和“我”字斗，即使学得再多，也是无济于事的。因为不“斗”，思想中的“冷气”就除不掉，干革命的劲头就“烧”不起来。
    欧阳海所以能够成为一个伟大的共产主义战士，正在于他能够不断地活学活用毛主席著作，毛泽东思想这个精神上的“煤”，在他心中产生了无穷的动力。
