    A Brief Discussion on "Even a Clever Cook Cannot Cook Without Rice"

    "Even a clever cook cannot cook without rice," this saying seems to make sense. However, it reflects a passive attitude of a "clever cook" being "helpless" in the face of "no rice," reflects the thinking of "seeing things but not people," and becomes an excuse for some people at work to emphasize objective conditions and ignore the subjective factors of people.
      "Clever cook" is "people," and "rice" is "things." The relationship between "clever cook" and "rice" is the relationship between people and things. Certain material conditions are the objective basis for us to do our work well, and are indispensable; however, things are created by people, and the human factor is primary. Chairman Mao said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle on earth can be created."
    The Daqing people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have set a brilliant example for us in straightening out the relationship between people and things. How to get a drilling rig weighing more than sixty tons onto the well site when there are no cranes or tractors? The Daqing people said: "People are alive, whether we carry it or move it, we still have to get it up..." They relied on their own hands, moving it inch by inch, foot by foot, and pulled these big guys onto the drilling platform. Wang Tieren said: "If there are conditions, we must go ahead; if there are no conditions, we must create conditions and go ahead!"
    The secret lies in the word "create." Without rice, the "clever cook" indeed cannot cook; but the "clever cook" has a brain and hands, can open up wasteland to grow fields, grow rice, and cook. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The stage on which the military strategist operates is built on objective material conditions, but the military strategist, relying on this stage, can direct many lively, majestic, and vigorous dramas." The Daqing people have already followed Chairman Mao's teachings and "directed" a "majestic and vigorous drama" on the "stage" of the Daqing Oilfield; 700 million Chinese people will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and "direct" one more "majestic and vigorous drama" after another on the "stage" of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and "direct" a brand new world!

    略谈“巧妇难为无米炊”
　　北京针织总厂　王瑞尧
    “巧妇难为无米炊”，这话听起来似乎有道理。然而它却反映了一种“巧妇”在“无米”面前“无所作为”的消极态度，反映了“见物不见人”的思想，成为一些人在工作中强调客观条件，忽视人的主观因素的口实。
      “巧妇”就是“人”，“米”，就是“物”。“巧妇”与“米”的关系，就是人与物的关系。一定的物质条件是我们作好工作的客观基础，是不可少的；然而，物又是人创造的，人的因素第一。毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以创造出来。”
    毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆人，在摆正人与物的关系问题上，为我们树立了光辉典型。六十多吨重的钻机，缺少吊车、拖拉机，怎样弄上井场？大庆人说：“人是活的，抬也好，搬也好，总是要上，……”硬是凭着双手，挪一寸，挪一尺，把这些大家伙拉上钻台。王铁人说过：“有条件要上，没有条件创造条件也要上！”
    奥妙就在这“创造”二字上。无米，“巧妇”的确无法作饭；但是“巧妇”有脑有手，可以开荒种田，长出米来，作出饭来。毛泽东同志说过：“军事家活动的舞台建筑在客观物质条件的上面，然而军事家凭着这个舞台，却可以导演出许多有声有色威武雄壮的活剧来。”大庆人已经按照毛主席的教导，在大庆油田的“舞台”上，“导演”出了“威武雄壮的活剧”；七亿中国人民，将继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在中国革命和世界革命的“舞台”上，导演出一幕幕更加“威武雄壮的活剧”来，“导演”出一个崭新的世界！
