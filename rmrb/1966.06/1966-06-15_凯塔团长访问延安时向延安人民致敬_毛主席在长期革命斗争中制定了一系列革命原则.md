    He also said that after visiting China's various construction projects, he understood that the Chinese people's principle of self-reliance and famous works on people's war, etc., were not put forward now, but were revolutionary principles that Chairman Mao had formulated long ago in the long revolutionary struggle of leading the Chinese people. He wished the people of Yan'an continued success in implementing Mao Zedong Thought and achieving even greater victories in future construction. After the banquet, the Yan'an Prefectural Administrative Office held a literary and artistic performance for the distinguished Malian guests.

    贵宾们离开宾馆之前，还为延安人民签字留念。留言中说：“马里的革命干部怀着尊敬的心情，向在决定性的年代里接待并勇敢地支援了解放军总部，保卫了毛泽东主席的延安人民致敬，并表示兄弟般的祝贺。”
    马里贵宾在延安期间，参观了延安革命纪念馆，访问了凤凰山路、杨家岭、枣园、王家坪等中共中央和毛主席当年居住过的旧址。
    十三日晚，延安专署副专员土金璋举行宴会，欢迎马里贵宾。土金璋在宴会上讲话，热烈祝贺马里人民在莫迪博·凯塔总统的领导下，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持非洲民族解放运动，维护亚非人民的团结和国内建设方面所取得的成就。他表示延安人民坚决支持马里人民和非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。
    马马杜·马戴拉·凯塔部长在讲话中代表马里人民向中国革命圣地——延安，向参加过革命和大生产运动，向保卫了革命的领导人的延安人民致以亲切热烈的敬意。他说，中共中央和毛主席在延安地区住了十多年，这里曾经是中国人民革命的首都。
    他还说，参观了中国的各项建设，明白了中国人民的自力更生的原则和关于人民战争等著名论著，不是现在才提出来的，而是毛主席领导中国人民在长期革命斗争中早已制订了的革命的原则。他祝延安人民继续贯彻毛泽东思想，在今后的建设中取得更大的胜利。宴会后，延安专署为马里贵宾举行了文艺晚会。
