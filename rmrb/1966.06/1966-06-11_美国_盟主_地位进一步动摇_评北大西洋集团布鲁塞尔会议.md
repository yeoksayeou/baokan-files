    The outcome of the recent North Atlantic Group Ministerial Council meeting in Brussels indicates that this aggressive military bloc is further collapsing, and the United States' "leader" status in the imperialist camp is becoming increasingly shaky.
    This Brussels meeting was held amidst great turbulence in the world situation. The in-depth development of the world people's revolutionary struggles, especially the vigorous rise of the anti-imperialist revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, cannot but have a profound impact on the imperialist camp. This inevitably leads to fierce division and reorganization within the imperialist bloc.
    After World War II, American imperialism arrogantly declared that the "American Century" had arrived. It not only carried out aggression and expansion in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but also sought to place all capitalist countries under its control. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "American imperialism even implements a 'survival of the fittest' policy towards its allies in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania, attempting to trample them underfoot." The North Atlantic Group is one tool for the United States to control its Western European "allies."
    The unevenness of economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Over the past two decades since the war, the balance of power within the imperialist camp has undergone fundamental changes. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, formed based on the balance of power in the early post-war period, can no longer be maintained as it was. Its decline and disintegration are inevitable. France's announcement of its withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" and its expulsion of American forces from Western Europe, to varying degrees, reflect the common desires of many member states of this bloc, only that de Gaulle took the biggest step. The general trend and popular sentiment are irresistible to the United States.
    Back then, the North Atlantic Group was cobbled together under the banner of anti-Sovietism. In recent years, the Khrushchev revisionists, in pursuit of the illusion of realizing US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, have pursued a line of capitulationism. On European issues, the Khrushchev revisionists have made concessions step by step, adopting a policy of "appeasement." In the eyes of American imperialism, the Soviet Union, whose leadership has been usurped by the revisionist clique, is no longer a threat but a close partner. With the vigorous development of the anti-American revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, with the successive victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle, and especially with China becoming a powerful fortress insisting on opposing the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism and resolutely supporting the anti-American struggles of the people of all countries, American imperialism has had to shift its global strategic focus from Western Europe to the Far East. The Johnson administration, on the one hand, vainly attempts to intensify the suppression of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle and the revolutionary movements of the Asian people, and directs its aggression towards China, and on the other hand, wants to maintain control over Western Europe. This precisely exposes a series of contradictions such as American imperialism's excessive ambition and insufficient strength. And de Gaulle is precisely taking advantage of the United States' difficult situation to take the lead in raising the banner of rebellion, demanding that the once formidable American leader get out of France. De Gaulle stated plausibly: "Due to the internal and external evolution of Eastern countries (note: referring to the modern revisionist bloc), the fact is that the West is no longer threatened as it was in the past when the United States used the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an excuse to establish a protective position in Europe. The danger to the West has disappeared far in the past and now." This enables Western European countries, especially France, to more justifiably resist the control exerted over them by the United States through the tool of the North Atlantic Group.
    It is precisely under these circumstances that the United States found itself in a weak and powerless position at the Brussels meeting. It can no longer be as arrogant as it used to be, it can no longer point fingers and issue orders, and it can no longer make its allies completely obedient and subservient to its baton. The Brussels meeting's decision to move the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and other important institutions of this aggressive bloc out of Paris and find new locations marks the accelerating disintegration of this military bloc under American control. In the words of American newspapers, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is already "crippled."
    At present, the contradictions between imperialist countries are more intense and complex than in the past. The contradictions between the United States and France are shifting from a stage mainly focused on control and anti-control to a new stage mainly focused on vying for hegemony in Europe. Surrounding this struggle between the United States and France, West Germany, Britain, Italy, and other Western European countries are engaging in intrigue and diplomatic maneuvers, forming a complex and intricate struggle situation. Under this situation, although the United States has racked its brains and tried to gather the other thirteen countries to isolate and besiege France, at the Brussels meeting, there were few followers and the ranks were not aligned. The era of American hegemony issuing orders and receiving immediate obedience is gone forever.
    Dividing one into two is the universal law of the development of things. The aggressive military blocs cobbled together and controlled by American imperialism are also subject to this objective law. The North Atlantic Group is accelerating its disintegration, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, etc., are also in the process of disintegration. With the further rise of the anti-American storm of the world's revolutionary people, and with the further failure of American imperialism's policies of aggression and war, one day, there will be a situation where the tree falls and the monkeys scatter. When that time comes, its doomsday will also be approaching.

    美国“盟主”地位进一步动摇
    ——评北大西洋集团布鲁塞尔会议
    本报评论员
    最近在布鲁塞尔召开的北大西洋集团部长理事会的结果，表明这个侵略性军事集团进一步走向崩溃，美国在帝国主义阵营中的盟主地位越来越动摇了。
    这次布鲁塞尔会议，是在世界局势大动荡的情况下举行的。世界人民革命斗争的深入发展，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反帝革命风暴的猛烈兴起，不能不对帝国主义阵营发生深刻的影响。这就必然使帝国主义集团内部发生剧烈分化和重新改组。
    美帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束后，狂妄地宣称：“美国世纪”已经来到了。它不仅向广大的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区进行侵略和扩张，而且要把所有的资本主义国家置于自己的控制之下。正如毛泽东同志指出的：“美帝国主义甚至对它在西欧、北美和大洋洲的盟国，也实行‘弱肉强食’的政策，力图把它们踩在自己的脚下。”北大西洋集团就是美国控制西欧“盟国”的一个工具。
    经济政治发展的不平衡是资本主义的绝对规律。战后二十多年来，帝国主义阵营内部的力量对比，发生了根本的变化。在战后初期实力对比的情况下组成的北大西洋公约组织，拖到今天，已经再也不能按老样子维持下去了。它的没落和瓦解，是势所必然的。法国宣布退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”，并且要把美国势力赶出西欧，这在不同程度上反映了这个集团许多成员国的共同愿望，只不过戴高乐的步子迈得最大罢了。大势所趋，人心所向，这是美国无法抗拒的。
    当年，北大西洋集团是打着反苏的旗帜拼凑起来的。近几年来，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了追求实现美苏合作主宰世界的迷梦，推行投降主义的路线。在欧洲问题上，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者步步退让，采取“绥靖”政策。在美帝国主义看来，被修正主义集团篡夺了领导权的苏联，对它早已不是什么威胁，而是亲密的伙伴了。随着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的反美革命斗争的蓬勃发展，随着越南人民抗美斗争的节节胜利，特别是中国已经成为坚持反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，坚决支援各国人民的反美斗争的强大堡垒，美帝国主义不得不把它的全球战略重点从西欧移到远东。约翰逊政府一面妄图加紧镇压越南人民的抗美救国斗争和亚洲人民的革命运动，并把侵略矛头指向中国，一面又想维持对西欧的控制。这就恰恰暴露了美帝国主义野心太大和实力不足等等一系列的矛盾。而戴高乐正是利用美国的处境困难，首先打出反叛的旗帜，要当年叱咤风云的美国盟主从法国滚出去。戴高乐振振有词地说：“由于东方国家（按：指现代修正主义集团）的内部和外部的演变，事实是，西方目前不再受过去在美国以北大西洋公约组织为借口在欧洲建立保护地位时所受到的威胁，对西方的危险过去和现在都远远地消失了”。这就使西欧国家，特别是法国，更能理直气壮地反抗美国通过北大西洋集团这一工具对它们进行的控制。
    正是在这种情况下，美国在布鲁塞尔会议上处于一种软弱无力的地位。它再也不能象过去那么神气了，它再也不能指手划脚、发号施令了，它再也不能使它的盟国完全俯首贴耳、听命于它的指挥棒了。布鲁塞尔会议决定把这个侵略集团的驻欧盟军最高司令部和其他重要机构迁出巴黎，另觅新址，标志美国控制下的这个军事集团正处于加速瓦解的过程中。用美国报纸的话来说，北大西洋公约组织已经“断肢缺腿”了。
    目前，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，比过去更为剧烈，更为复杂了。美法矛盾正在从以控制与反控制为主的阶段，转入到以争霸欧洲为主的新阶段。围绕着美法之间的这一斗争，西德、英国、意大利和其他西欧国家勾心斗角，纵横捭阖，形成了一种错综复杂的斗争局面。在这种形势下，美国虽然煞费心机，力图纠集其他十三国，孤立和围攻法国，但是在布鲁塞尔会议上，追随者寥寥无几，旗鼓不整。美国霸主一呼百诺的时代，已经一去不返了。
    一分为二是事物发展的普遍规律。美帝国主义所拼凑和控制的侵略性军事集团，也同样地受这个客观规律的支配。北大西洋集团正在加速四分五裂，东南亚军事集团、中央条约组织等等，也处于分崩离析之中。随着世界革命人民反美风暴的进一步兴起，随着美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的进一步失败，总有一天，会出现树倒猢狲散的局面，到了那个时候，它的末日也就临近了。
