Prince Souphanouvong and Others Issue Joint Statement
Condemn U.S. Imperialism and Lao Rightists for Subverting the National Unity Government
Reaffirm the Struggle for a Peaceful, Neutral, Independent, Democratic, United, and Prosperous Laos

New China News Agency, Khamkeut, June 24th - According to the Pathet Lao radio broadcast: On June 22nd, Vice Premier Prince Souphanouvong of the Lao National Unity Government and ministers and state secretaries from the Lao Patriotic Front and neutralist forces within this government issued a joint statement on the fourth anniversary of the government's establishment.

The statement severely condemns the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the Lao right-wing clique in subverting the Lao National Unity Government, and reaffirms the struggle for a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, united, and prosperous Laos.

The statement says that after the establishment of the Lao National Unity Government on June 23, 1962, U.S. imperialism and the Lao right-wing clique used various cunning and deceitful methods to sabotage this government. Finally, through the military coup staged in Vientiane on April 19, 1964, they overthrew this government and later created the puppet regime in Vientiane.

Under the direct command of the American neocolonial rulers, the regime in Vientiane is pursuing domestic and foreign policies that are completely at odds with the political program of the National Unity Government and the wishes of the Lao people for peace and neutrality. It sells out the country's sovereignty and independence and serves U.S. imperialism in strengthening and expanding its aggression against Laos.

The Vientiane puppet regime, in order to carry out the U.S. imperialist policy of "using Laotians to fight Laotians," has dispatched mercenaries equipped and commanded by the United States to launch continuous nibbling attacks on the liberated areas of the Lao Patriotic Front and neutralist forces. Especially in the past two years, Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Vientiane puppet regime, in collusion with American invaders, have used various types of modern jet aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, to bomb and strafe the liberated areas, committing heinous crimes against the Lao people.

The statement says that to help U.S. imperialism extricate itself from its desperate situation in South Vietnam, the U.S. puppet clique in Laos is hastening to prepare conditions for the direct invasion of the central and southern regions of Laos by the U.S. Army.

The statement points out that in the areas controlled by the United States and its puppets, peasants are concentrated in "strategic hamlets" and "development zones" disguised as concentration camps; the majority of the urban population is ruthlessly exploited, and their lives are becoming increasingly impoverished.

The areas controlled by the U.S. puppet clique are hung with the deceptive sign of an "independent state," but in reality, they are a new type of American colony and a war base.

The statement says that in foreign affairs, the Vientiane puppet regime follows American orders, closely colludes with American lackeys and puppets, especially the Thai reactionary regime and the South Vietnamese puppet clique, to serve American aggression against Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia. The Vientiane puppet regime opens the door wide for the American lackey—the Japanese reactionary ruling clique—to send people to Laos for espionage activities and to monopolize the Lao economy.

The Vientiane puppet regime has repeatedly fabricated incidents to slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. It is well known that these two countries have consistently and thoroughly respected and strictly adhered to the Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue, actively supporting Laos' sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, peace, and neutrality. The Vientiane puppet regime also defames and opposes the neutral country of Cambodia. The statement says that currently, the Vientiane government, with Prince Souvanna Phouma as the "prime minister," is wearing the disguise of "independence," "peace and neutrality," and "unity government" to deceive public opinion and cover up their treacherous acts. In essence, it is merely an illegal regime, completely serving as an American puppet, becoming the main tool for the U.S. to wage "special warfare" in Laos. It has no right to represent the Lao people. This puppet regime has been and is being condemned and opposed by the Lao people and is being spat upon by the peace-loving people of the world.

The statement solemnly declares: "We will continue to shoulder the extremely glorious and arduous task entrusted to us by the country and the people, and struggle for a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, united, and prosperous Laos."

The statement says: "The U.S. government must thoroughly respect and strictly adhere to the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Lao issue, must abandon all plots and means of aggression against Laos, and must not interfere in Laos' internal affairs, allowing the Laotians to solve their own internal affairs."

The statement finally expresses absolute confidence that the Lao people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation will surely achieve a complete victory.

    苏发努冯亲王等发表联合声明
    谴责美帝和老挝右派颠覆民族团结政府
    重申继续为建立和平中立独立民主统一和繁荣的老挝而斗争
    新华社康开二十四日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王和这个政府中的老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的大臣和国务秘书，二十二日就这个政府成立四周年发表联合声明。
    声明严厉谴责美帝国主义和老挝右派集团颠覆老挝三方民族团结政府的罪行，重申为建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而斗争。
    声明说，一九六二年六月二十三日老挝三方民族团结政府成立后，美帝国主义和老挝右派走狗集团就用各种阴险和狡猾的手段来破坏这个政府。最后是通过一九六四年四月十九日在万象策划的军事政变推翻了这个政府，后来又制造了万象傀儡政权。
    在美国新殖民主义统治者的直接指挥下，万象的政权奉行着完全同三方民族团结政府的政治纲领背道而驰、同老挝人民的和平与中立愿望背道而驰的内外政策，出卖国家的主权与独立，为美帝国主义加强和扩大对老挝的侵略战争效劳。
    万象伪政权为了推行美帝国主义“用老挝人打老挝人”的阴险政策，派遣由美国装备和指挥的雇佣军，接连对老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量解放区发动蚕食进攻，特别是最近两年多来，富马亲王和万象伪政权同美国侵略者合伙，使用各种类型的现代化喷气式飞机，包括B—52型战略轰炸机，疯狂地轰炸、扫射解放区各地，对老挝人民犯下了滔天的罪行。
    声明说，为了帮助美帝国主义摆脱它在越南南方陷入泥潭的绝望处境，美国在老挝的走狗集团正加紧为美国陆军直接侵占中寮和下寮地区准备条件。
    声明指出，在美国及其走狗控制的地区，农民被集中到“团结村”和“振兴区”等变相集中营里；城市中的大多数人民被残酷剥削，生活日益贫困。
    美国走狗集团控制的地区挂着“独立国家”的骗人招牌，但它实质上是美国的新型殖民地和战争基地。
    声明说，在对外方面，万象伪政权奉行美国的命令，同美国的仆从和走狗，首先是同泰国反动当局和南越傀儡集团紧密勾结，为美国对老挝、印度支那和东南亚的侵略政策效劳。万象伪政权为美国的仆从——日本反动统治集团派人到老挝进行间谍活动和垄断老挝经济敞开大门。
    万象伪政权多次制造事件来污蔑越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国。众所周知，这两个国家一贯彻底地尊重和严正地履行关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，积极支持老挝的主权、独立、领土完整、和平与中立。万象伪政权还诋毁和反对中立国家柬埔寨。声明说，目前，以富马为“首相”的万象政权，披着“独立”、“和平中立”和“联合政府”的外衣，企图欺骗舆论和掩盖它们干的祸国殃民的勾当，实质上只不过是一个非法的政权，彻头彻尾地充当美国的傀儡，变成了为美国在老挝进行“特种战争”服务的主要工具。它毫无资格代表老挝人民。这个傀儡政权已经和正在遭到老挝人民的谴责和反对，遭到全世界爱好和平人民的唾骂。
    声明郑重宣布：“我们将继续担负起祖国和人民所交给的极其光荣而繁重的任务，为建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而斗争。”
    声明说：“美国政府必须彻底尊重和严正履行一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，必须放弃侵略老挝的一切阴谋和手段，不准干涉老挝的内部事务，让老挝人自己解决老挝的内部事务。”
    声明最后表示绝对相信，老挝人民抗美救国的正义斗争，必将取得彻底胜利。
