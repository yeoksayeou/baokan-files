    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own destruction. The awakening of the masses of the people in colonies and semi-colonies and the awakening of the masses of the people within imperialist countries themselves are such conditions. Imperialism is driving the masses of the people all over the world into the great struggle to wipe out imperialism.
