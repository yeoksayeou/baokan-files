    Hanoi, June 9th (Xinhua News Agency) - The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 9th, expressing the Vietnamese people's full support for the Indonesian people's just struggle against the pro-American and reactionary clique.
    The commentary, entitled "The Heinous Face of Indonesia's New Regime in Ruining the Country and Bringing Disaster to the People Has Been Fully Exposed," stated that eight months after the pro-American and reactionary clique seized power in Indonesia, the country's appearance has completely changed. Domestically, a fascist system has been established; externally, it has completely leaned towards imperialism. The true face of the pro-American and reactionary Indonesian clique has been revealed. The Indonesian people and the people of the world have clearly seen that it is precisely them and their masters—the imperialists headed by the United States—who conspired to stage a coup d'état in Indonesia, and that the September 30th Movement was a just and patriotic action carried out to stop the reactionary clique's coup plot and defend the Indonesian revolution.
    The commentary said that the Indonesian people and the people of all countries clearly see the close relationship between the Indonesian reactionary clique and imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Recently, they have openly sided with the imperialist camp.
    The commentary stated that the Indonesian reactionary authorities' actions against China and their persecution of overseas Chinese have pleased the imperialist bloc. Having received rewards from their masters, they have become even more rampant in their opposition to China. They sent thugs to storm the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and many consulates, carrying out large-scale destruction and assaulting Chinese diplomats. Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese have been massacred, beaten, robbed of their property, and had their homes burned down.
    The commentary said that recently, a newspaper of the Indonesian reactionary clique also distorted the South Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation and slandered the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. The pro-American and reactionary Indonesian clique has also blatantly arrested and shut down the personnel and agencies of the national liberation movements in North Kalimantan and Malaya located in Jakarta. The Indonesian reactionary clique, through the above actions, opposes socialist countries and the revolutionary movements in Southeast Asia and the world.
    The commentary pointed out that the pro-American and reactionary Indonesian authorities are following a path of anti-people and counter-revolution. They are intensifying their activities in an attempt to completely extinguish the Indonesian revolutionary movement and turn Indonesia into a country subordinate to imperialism. However, in any case, their conspiracy cannot be realized. The commentary pointed out that although the Indonesian reactionary clique's terrorist actions have caused significant losses to the Indonesian revolutionary forces and the people, the Indonesian revolutionary movement will not be extinguished as a result. The Indonesian revolutionary movement has made great progress. The Indonesian people have become politically awakened. The Communist Party of Indonesia is a party with a forty-six-year history of heroic and glorious struggle for Indonesia's independence and for the rights of the Indonesian working people. The Indonesian people, the Communist Party of Indonesia, and the various patriotic and progressive forces of Indonesia will surely win, and the reactionary doglegs of imperialism will surely be overthrown. The more the reactionary clique slides down the path of ruining the country and bringing disaster to the people, the more their ugly faces will be exposed, the deeper the people's hatred for them will be, and the more the struggle against them will be promoted.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the Indonesian people's struggle against the imperialist reactionary dogleg clique is a just struggle for the interests of Indonesia and for the interests of the revolutionary movements in Southeast Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people fully support the fraternal Indonesian people in this struggle.

    越《人民报》指出印尼的革命运动是扑灭不了的
    印尼亲美反动集团祸国殃民必将被推翻
    据新华社河内九日电　越南《人民报》九日发表评论，表示越南人民完全支持印度尼西亚人民反对亲美反动集团的正义斗争。
    这篇题为《印度尼西亚新政权的祸国殃民面目已经暴露无遗》的评论说，在亲美反动集团夺取印度尼西亚政权的八个月后，这个国家的面貌完全改变了。在国内，建立了法西斯制度，在对外方面，完全投靠了帝国主义。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的真面目被揭穿了。印度尼西亚人民和世界人民都看清正是它们及其主子——以美国为首的帝国主义阴谋在印度尼西亚搞政变，而九月三十日运动的行动是正义、爱国的，是为了制止反动派的政变阴谋和保卫印度尼西亚革命而进行的行动。
    评论说，印度尼西亚人民和各国人民清楚地看到印度尼西亚反动集团同帝国主义，特别是同美帝国主义的密切关系。最近，它们已经公开地倒向帝国主义阵营一边。
    评论说，印度尼西亚反动当局反对中国和迫害华侨的行动，使帝国主义集团感到高兴。它们得到主子的犒赏，就更加猖狂地反对中国。它们派遣暴徒冲进中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和许多领事馆，进行大肆破坏，对中国外交人员行凶。数以万计的华侨遭到它们的屠杀、殴打、抢劫财产、焚毁房屋。
    评论说，最近，印度尼西亚反动集团的一家报纸还歪曲越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争和诋毁越南南方民族解放阵线。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团还明目张胆地逮捕和封闭设在雅加达的北加里曼丹和马来亚的各个民族解放运动的人员和机关。印度尼西亚反动集团通过以上行动来反对社会主义国家和反对东南亚和世界的革命运动。
    评论指出，印度尼西亚亲美反动当局正在沿着反人民、反革命的道路走下去。它们正在加紧活动，企图彻底扑灭印度尼西亚的革命运动，并且把印度尼西亚变成一个附属于帝国主义的国家。但是，无论如何，它们的这个阴谋是无法实现的。评论指出，虽然，印度尼西亚反动集团的恐怖行动给印度尼西亚革命力量和人民造成了重大损失，但是印度尼西亚的革命运动是不会因此而被扑灭的。印度尼西亚革命运动有了很大的发展。印度尼西亚人民在政治上已经觉醒了。印度尼西亚共产党是一个有着四十六年为印度尼西亚的独立和为争取印度尼西亚劳动人民的各种权利而进行英勇和光荣斗争历史的政党。印度尼西亚人民、印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚的各种爱国进步力量一定会胜利，帝国主义的反动走狗集团一定将会被推翻。反动集团越是沿着祸国殃民的道路滑下去，它们的丑恶面目就越加暴露，人民对它们的仇恨就越深，反对它们的战斗就越加得到促进。
    评论最后说，印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义反动走狗集团的斗争是一场为着印度尼西亚的利益、为着东南亚和世界革命运动的利益而进行的正义斗争。越南人民完全支持在这一斗争中的兄弟的印度尼西亚人民。
