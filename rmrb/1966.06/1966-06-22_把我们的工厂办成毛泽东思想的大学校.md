    Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in a letter concerning the living study and application of Chairman Mao’s works on the industrial and transportation front:
    Mao Zedong Thought reflects the objective laws of domestic and international class struggle, and the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people. Mao Zedong Thought did not arise spontaneously from the laboring people, but was rather a brilliant inheritance and development by Chairman Mao of Marxism-Leninism based on great revolutionary practice, a synthesis of the new experiences of the international communist movement, elevating Marxism-Leninism to a completely new stage.
    Therefore, it is imperative to instill Mao Zedong Thought into workers and peasants through the living study and application of Chairman Mao’s works, in order to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and to transform spiritual strength into immense material power.
    Since 1961, the 3517 Factory has conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, placing the living study and application of Chairman Mao’s works at the forefront of all tasks. This factory, through the living study and application of Chairman Mao’s works, has instilled Mao Zedong Thought into the masses of workers and staff. As a result, the proletarian consciousness of the workers and staff has been greatly heightened, their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity have been fully brought into play, and spiritual strength has been transformed into immense material power. They have achieved excellent results in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation.
    The working class is the most advanced and most revolutionary class. However, the working masses themselves cannot spontaneously generate the revolutionary theories that guide their actions. It is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work for them, and strengthen the education of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by arming the minds of the broad masses of workers and staff with Mao Zedong Thought can they have a firm and correct political direction, have vigorous revolutionary drive, and become conscious proletarian revolutionary fighters.
    Our factories are not only positions for carrying out the struggle for production, but also positions for carrying out class struggle. What do we rely on to run factories well? We rely on Mao Zedong Thought, we rely on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must turn the factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Cultivating and creating revolutionized laborers of the proletariat with Mao Zedong Thought is the primary task of our factories.
    Some people say: Factories are for production, they are for producing products. Producing products should be the primary task, how can cultivating revolutionized people be the primary task?
    We say: That’s not right. Marxism-Leninism has always held that people are the most active and decisive factor in the productive forces.
    Chairman Mao said:
    Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle on earth can be created.
    Our factories must adhere to the socialist direction, take the socialist road, and serve socialist construction and the broad masses of working people. If it is only for producing products, then what is the difference between that and a capitalist factory? Only with people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can we adhere to the socialist and communist direction. With such people, we will certainly be able to produce large quantities of advanced products. With such people, we can truly run socialist factories well.
    Facts prove once again: Following the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, giving prominence to politics, living studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, grasping living ideas greatly, and grasping the ideological revolutionization of people greatly, any work can be done well. This is the case with the army, this is the case with factories, and this is the case with all work.

    把我们的工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校
    林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信中指出：
    毛泽东思想，反映了国内国际阶级斗争的客观规律，反映了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。毛泽东思想并不是劳动人民自发地产生的，而是毛主席在伟大的革命实践基础上天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义的思想，是综合了国际共产主义运动的新经验，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    因此，必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。
    三五一七工厂，从一九六一年以来，认真贯彻执行了军委和林彪同志的指示，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。这个厂，通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到职工群众中去。这样，职工群众的无产阶级觉悟就大大提高了，他们的革命积极性和创造性就充分发挥出来了，精神力量就转化为巨大的物质力量。他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，取得了很好的成绩。
    工人阶级是最先进、最革命的阶级。但是，工人群众自己不能自发地产生指导他们行动的革命理论。必须对他们加强政治思想工作，加强毛泽东思想的教育。只有用毛泽东思想武装广大职工的头脑，才能使他们有坚定正确的政治方向，有旺盛的革命干劲，成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士。
    我们的工厂，不仅是进行生产斗争的阵地，而且是进行阶级斗争的阵地。办好工厂靠什么？靠毛泽东思想，靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。必须把工厂办成一座毛泽东思想的大学校。用毛泽东思想培养和造就无产阶级的革命化的劳动者，是我们工厂的首要任务。
    有人说：工厂是搞生产的，是要出产品的。应当把出产品作为首要任务，怎么能把培养革命化的人作为首要任务呢？
    我们说：不对。马克思列宁主义从来认为，人是生产力中最活跃的起决定作用的因素。
    毛主席说：
    世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。
    我们的工厂，一定要坚持社会主义方向，走社会主义道路，为社会主义建设和广大劳动人民服务。如果仅仅是为了出产品，那和资本主义的工厂还有什么两样呢？有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能坚持社会主义、共产主义的方向。有了这样的人，也一定能出大量的、先进的产品。有了这样的人，才能真正办好社会主义的工厂。
    事实再一次证明：按照军委和林彪同志的指示，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，大抓活的思想，大抓人的思想革命化，无论什么工作都可以做好。部队是这样，工厂也是这样，一切工作都是这样。
