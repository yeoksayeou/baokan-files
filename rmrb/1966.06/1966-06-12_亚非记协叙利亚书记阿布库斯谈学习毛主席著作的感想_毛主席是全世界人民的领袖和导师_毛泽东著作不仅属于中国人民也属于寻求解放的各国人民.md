    Xinhua News Agency, June 11th -- Abu Qus, Syrian Secretary of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters his thoughts on studying Volume I of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," saying that Mao Zedong's writings not only belong to the Chinese people and guide the Chinese revolution, but also belong to the people of all countries who seek a path to liberation from these writings.
    He said, "Mao Zedong's writings are great writings. They enlighten the reader, correctly guide the reader to consider their own practice, to examine it, and to find the correct solutions from it." "Works that reach such a level are truly immortal works."
    He said that Mao Zedong's writings are like the sun, calling on us to work and urging people to struggle. Mao Zedong's writings also expose all conspiracies of compromise, concession, surrender, and 'peaceful coexistence,' and encourage us to carry out armed revolutionary struggle. Without armed struggle, we cannot defeat our enemies.
    He praised Chairman Mao's scientific thesis that "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." He said, "Only those who are willing to fail, surrender, and betray the cause of the people of all countries deny the correctness of Mao Zedong's writings."
    He emphasized that we should continue to hold high the banner of opposition to imperialism and all enemies, never compromise or concede to them, and never make any deals with them on the principle of eliminating colonialism.
    He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong has become a creative leader in the theoretical analysis and revolutionary practice of Marxism-Leninism."
    He said, "The Selected Works of Mao Zedong are written in simple, national language, so people with a little education can understand them. It is written specifically for the broad masses of the people."
    He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong's writings have taught me many things, especially when I encounter difficulties in my thinking and organization and feel helpless, it has taught me how to solve problems." He said, "After reading Mao Zedong's writings, I am now able to use it to analyze the situation in Arab countries and to identify the right and wrong of each step in the Arab struggle."
    He concluded, "I should thank Chairman Mao Zedong's writings. Hundreds of millions of people around the world thank Mao Zedong's writings and thank the Chinese people for the great achievements they have made by persevering in studying Mao Zedong's writings. This is the most sublime gratitude of the people of the world to the leader and teacher of the people of the whole world, and they will always thank him."

    亚非记协叙利亚书记阿布库斯谈学习毛主席著作的感想
    毛主席是全世界人民的领袖和导师
    毛泽东著作不仅属于中国人民也属于寻求解放的各国人民
    新华社十一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处叙利亚书记阿布库斯最近对新华社记者谈到他学习《毛泽东选集》第一卷的感想时说，毛泽东的著作不仅属于中国人民和指导中国的革命，而且也属于要求从这些著作中寻找解放道路的各国人民。
    他说：“毛泽东的著作是伟大的著作，它启发读者的觉悟，正确地指导读者去考虑自己的实践，去检查它并从中找到正确的解决办法。”“达到如此水平的作品真是不朽的著作。”
    他说：毛泽东的著作就好比是太阳，号召我们去工作，督促人们去斗争。毛泽东的著作也揭露了一切妥协、让步、投降和“和平共处”的阴谋，鼓舞我们去进行武装的革命斗争。没有武装斗争，我们便不能战胜我们的敌人。
    他赞扬毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的科学论断。他说：“只有那些甘心失败、投降、背叛各国人民事业的人，才否认毛泽东著作的正确性。”
    他强调说，应当继续高举反对帝国主义和一切敌人的旗帜，绝不向他们妥协、让步，绝不在消灭殖民主义的原则上同他们作任何交易。
    他说，“毛泽东主席在对马克思列宁主义的理论分析和革命实践方面成为一位有创造性的领袖”。
    他说，“毛泽东选集是用浅显的、民族的语言写的，因此，稍有一些文化的人都会看懂。他是专为广大人民群众而写的”。
    他说，“毛泽东主席的著作教给了我许多东西，特别是当我在思想上、组织上遇到困难，感到束手无策的时候，它教了我解决问题的办法。”他说：“在读了毛泽东的著作之后，我今天能够用它来分析阿拉伯国家的形势，也能够识别在阿拉伯斗争事业中每一个步骤上的正确和错误。”
    他最后说：“我应该感谢毛泽东主席的著作。全世界亿万人民都感谢毛泽东的著作，并且感谢中国人民由于坚持不懈地学习毛泽东的著作而取得的伟大成就。这是世界人民对这位全世界人民的领袖和导师的最崇高的谢意，他们将永远感谢他。”
