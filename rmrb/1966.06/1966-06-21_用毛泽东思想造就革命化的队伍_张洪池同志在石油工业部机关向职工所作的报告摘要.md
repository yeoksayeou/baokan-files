Editor’s Note: Emphasizing politics must be implemented on people, and on the ideological revolutionization of people. Comrade Zhang Hongchi is an instructor at Daqing Oilfield. He has a profound understanding of the great significance of emphasizing politics, believing that the key to doing a good job in the oilfield is to build a highly revolutionary workforce armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Because he grasped the fundamental point of political work, he achieved outstanding results.

All our undertakings are the undertakings of the masses and must be carried out by relying on the masses. The progress of various undertakings depends on the degree of revolutionization of the masses and cadres. If we want to do a good job in industry, we must have a revolutionary workforce; if we want to do a good job in agriculture, we must have a revolutionary agricultural production army; if we want to do a good job in commerce, education, culture, and all undertakings, we must have a revolutionary team. With such a revolutionary team, we can guarantee the implementation of the Party's line and policies and create any human miracle.

Arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and realizing the ideological revolutionization of people is the fundamental purpose of emphasizing politics. At present, our country is undergoing a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a great revolution touching people's souls. All regions and departments should, in this great revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from and apply the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing politics, and take a big step forward in promoting the ideological revolutionization of people.

I used to be a cook in the exploration headquarters. In 1964, I was transferred to the well-logging team of the drilling headquarters as an instructor. The well-logging team has 184 people, divided into 13 types of work. This team has been able to endure hardships and complete the tasks assigned by the Party after several years of battle. Of course, there is also class struggle, ideological class struggle, in this team. Faced with this situation, based on my own experience over the years, to do a good job, we must rely on the leadership of the Party, we must arm the worker comrades with Mao Zedong Thought, and we must rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses.

Raising Class Consciousness is Fundamental

In our team, a few people were complaining about their wages and benefits, and some disliked the hardship of the well-logging team and asked to be transferred. At first, I patiently talked to them. Some comrades thought this was like a blind man lighting a lamp – a waste of time, and said to me: "These people's problems are not difficult to solve. Give them a stern criticism, and they will be honest." I said: "We can't do that. These comrades are class brothers, they suffered class oppression in the old society and grew up in hardship. They are only temporarily backward, surrounded by the enemy of bourgeois individualism, and have not yet awakened. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to raise their consciousness."

At that time, Wang Miyu was a relatively typical case. This person came from a poor family, suffered oppression from landlords in the old society, and participated in the revolution after liberation. People like him are most determined in the revolution as long as they are given more education and their class consciousness is raised. But he was burdened with a good family background, was undisciplined, and dared to do anything. After I figured out his situation, I said to him: "Master Wang, you are an old worker and have been participating in the revolution for a long time. You have the responsibility to educate the younger generation. Tell the young people about the sufferings you endured in the old society and let the young people who grew up in sugar water receive an education." He was unwilling to speak at that time. I asked him: "Why don't you speak?" He said: "People will say, you came from such a bitter background and are still so backward." After several enlightenments, he recalled his past sufferings at a staff and worker meeting, which educated everyone, and he himself underwent a great transformation.

But after a period of time, the problem came up again. Sometimes the captain would ask him to do some work, and he wouldn't go and would argue with the captain. Some people said: "This comrade can't be changed." At that time, I thought, since he was so backward before and could change through that recollection of past sufferings, I believe that as long as I arm him with Mao Zedong Thought, he can become a conscious revolutionary. Later, I moved into the collective dormitory where he lived and stayed with him. Once, I said to him: "In enterprises, implementing the class line means relying on old workers and relying on the activists of the working class, so we must rely on you! You are always enthusiastic about the cause of the Party, aren't you! I am a new recruit. If I make any mistakes in implementing the Party's policies, point them out to me and help me, so that the cause of the Party will not suffer losses." He said: "No, no, you haven't done anything wrong." Later, he began to examine his own shortcomings. After he realized his shortcomings, I used Chairman Mao's words to enlighten him and read him a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations. In the editor's note of the article "This Township Has Achieved Cooperation in Two Years," Chairman Mao criticized a type of person, saying: "This kind of person is always passive, always stops before moving forward at critical moments, and always needs someone to give him a strong push on his back before he is willing to take a step forward." After hearing this passage, he remembered the spirit. He said to his comrades: "My revolution, Wang Miyu, is always pushed by others before taking a step. The revolution is not conscious." Because he could listen to Chairman Mao's words, his consciousness was further raised. I also used my own practical actions to influence him, and he truly transformed. In the past two years, he has been continuously rated as a "Five-Good Red Flag Bearer."

This made me realize that: length must be measured with a ruler, weight must be measured with a scale, and people must be measured with a class standard. As long as we treat a class brother according to Chairman Mao's words, arm him with Mao Zedong Thought, and help him with deep class feelings, and raise his class consciousness, he will continue to progress. Wang Miyu's transformation proves that raising class consciousness is the fundamental way to transform a person.

Help Comrades with Class Feelings

The cadres of the team are on an equal footing under the collective leadership of the Party branch. To improve the relationship between cadres, when encountering problems, they should be resolved through branch discussions and consultations, and the branch secretary should not impose his opinions on others. A forced melon is not sweet, and imposed opinions are not accepted by others. It is necessary to state the facts and reason things out so that every cadre truly realizes that it is not acceptable to not act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.

Xin, the captain of our team, was enthusiastic about his work and eager to do a good job. He thought about his work while walking, eating, and sleeping. But he did not emphasize politics in managing production. The workers called him the "Number-Counting Captain." In the morning, he looked at the number of well-logging operations; on the well site, he looked at the number of curve lines; at the motor pool, he counted the number of vehicles; in the evening, he checked the number of staff and workers. He was busy with production all day long, and whenever there was a problem, he would go to the top; whenever there was a problem, he would run to it. According to Chairman Mao's instructions on dissecting a sparrow and grasping the main contradictions, I advised him: "We should sit down and study what problems exist." After research by the Party branch committee, it was determined to carry out activities to find shortcomings. First, we organized a force to dissect Team Three, and found more than 130 shortcomings, which greatly shocked everyone ideologically. After finding shortcomings and making rectifications, accidents decreased and things became easier.

Once, when the wellhead worker of Team Five was operating, he was talking to someone, and the instrument was pulled up two centimeters away from touching the pulley. Fortunately, the winch driver saw it and quickly braked, preventing an instrument-falling-into-the-well accident. Ren Kang, the acting captain of Team Five, did not report this after returning. When Captain Xin went to Team Five for lunch, he heard the driver discussing it. Some said: "Today we should give the winch driver a merit." Some said: "It almost caused an accident, and you still want to give him a merit!" After hearing this, Captain Xin asked seven people, including the duty cadre, and none of them knew about it. Captain Xin said angrily: "We must hold a meeting and give Ren Kang a stern criticism." I said to him: "Don't rush to criticize him, first find out what happened. Not only must he be educated and truly realize his mistake, but everyone must also be educated." Later, after a study by several branch committee members, they said: "The problem lies with the workers, but the root is with the cadres. If we hold a meeting, we must first make a self-criticism." Because this was not the only accident, we had recently experienced several signs of accidents. A few days ago, Team Eight dropped an instrument into the well, stopped production to salvage it, and caused losses to the state. After the branch committee meeting, we first organized some key personnel to discuss: Are accidents avoidable? What are the hazards of accidents? Then, we held a staff and worker meeting, invited old workers to talk about the comparison between the old and new societies, and put the broken instrument that had fallen down before everyone. When we talked about the signs of this accident, everyone realized that although there were only two centimeters away from causing an accident this time, our thinking had already fallen into the well. We are here to make revolution, and we cannot cause losses to the country. After calculating the political and economic accounts, everyone was very saddened. At this time, I checked myself: "The problem lies with the comrades, but the root is with us cadres. The accident signs are not only in Team Five, but also in other teams. This is a matter of thought and style. As the 'squad leader', to lead the team, I must lead the thought and the style, but now I have not led everyone well. We must carry this broken instrument to the well site to find the reasons and find the gaps." At that time, everyone was scrambling to carry it. After the instrument was carried away, everyone started discussing, and some comrades were so moved that they shed tears. We carried the broken instrument for fifteen kilometers to the well site. We and the comrades of Team Five surrounded the wellhead to find shortcomings, found a total of fifty shortcomings, and studied Chairman Mao's writings. Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in line with the interests of the people. If there are any mistakes, we must correct them. This is called being responsible to the people." Everyone said: "We dropped the instrument, causing losses to the people and losses to the Party. We must bury the bad style under the well and take the good style back."

That night, we held another staff and worker meeting, and the entire team comprehensively identified shortcomings, which promoted the work.

Do More Investigation, Plant the Roots in the Masses

Chairman Mao said that there is no right to speak without investigation. We must put down our airs and willingly be students of the masses. There was a technician in our team named Yang Yuanshan, who would seize on people's shortcomings and severely criticize them. Once, Team Six supported Team Three with a motor. Team Six gave Team Three an old motor. After hearing the feedback from Team Three, Yang Yuanshan did not investigate and insisted that Team Six had replaced the good parts from the old motor, and gave Team Six a hard time, telling them to replace it with a new one for Team Three. In this way, Team Six certainly did not accept it. One day, I said to him: "Old Yang, tomorrow you will come with me to Team Six to investigate the situation. Why does this team always have problems?" When we arrived at Team Six, we investigated each problem clearly and wrote them into short stories. I asked him to talk about these problems at the staff and worker meeting, and said to Yang Yuanshan: "You don't need to criticize anything like a bad style, not being responsible to the people, etc. Just explain each problem to everyone clearly, and explaining it clearly is itself a criticism, and everyone will see it clearly." During the discussion, everyone said: "Technician Yang has accurately identified the problem this time. In the past, he always criticized our team for having a bad style, this problem, that problem, not being responsible to the people, but this time we saw the problem. This is of great help to us." Later, I asked Old Yang, how was this investigation? He said: "This investigation was very profound. I didn't criticize anyone by name, but everyone was sincerely convinced, and the gains were great. I will not criticize or praise without grasping first-hand information in the future." I said: "Not only should we put out each problem, but we should also emphasize politics and analyze it with Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, your analysis and solution of problems was just dealing with the matter itself. If you use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze it, you will give everyone a political lesson." From then on, this comrade began to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and paid attention to investigation and research in his work. The staff and workers reflected: "The branch committee of our team is a melting pot. Yang Yuanshan was relatively backward before, but this time he really used Mao Zedong Thought, and he spoke in a way that convinced us and warmed our hearts."

Cadres should not impose their opinions on others, but let the masses realize the problems themselves, which requires acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Once, I visited the exhibition hall of oilfield construction and saw oil wells one by one on the model, and crude oil was sent to the oil depot through the oil transfer station. I thought at the time: Our team is a small team operating separately, if the team cadres can be like oil wells, one person in one team, rooted in each small team, and go deep into the masses, wouldn't many situations be understood clearly? Some cadres, whose families live here, refuse to live in the small team no matter how you ask them. At first, only Captain Xin, Deputy Instructor Wang, and I lived in three small teams respectively. Captain Xin became very familiar with the situation in Team One. Deputy Instructor Wang summarized how to do the work of backward people in Team Three, and shared his experience at the meeting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I seized on these two things and talked a lot about the benefits of living in the small team. Living in the small team, the staff and workers are by your side every day, and you have an impression in your mind, and you can understand what they are thinking. At the branch committee meeting, I put forward the opinion that cadres should live in the small teams. After discussion, everyone agreed. After the cadres lived in the small teams, the situations were discovered quickly, understood clearly, and the problems were solved in a timely manner, and the cadres were constantly under the supervision of the masses. In this way, technical cadres did ideological work, political cadres also understood the production situation, and the entire branch committee was united.

The Key Is to Build a Team with Mao Zedong Thought

Through the study of Chairman Mao's works and the tempering of actual struggle over the past two years, I have realized that if cadres want to lead the team well, they must first arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal and diligent to the cause of the Party and the people. We must rely on the Party, rely on the wisdom of the masses, and rely on the strength of the masses.

How to lead staff and workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way?

First, grasp class education. Arm the minds of staff and workers with the viewpoint of class struggle. In this way, studying Chairman Mao's works can be linked to reality. Class struggle is not only carried out in movements, but must be integrated into daily actions and production. Taking wage evaluation as an example, is it just giving him money, or is it grasping class education? The leadership believes that the main thing is to improve the consciousness of the staff and workers. After discussion by the branch, it was also agreed that we should seize this evaluation opportunity to focus on class education. At that time, we researched and determined to carry out three talks (talking about the situation, talking about understanding, talking about the Party's cultivation) and three comparisons (comparing the old society, comparing the countryside, comparing one's own contribution to the Party). The old worker He Daolai started crying as he talked. He said: "In the old society, what was there to evaluate wages? I was over ten years old and still didn't have pants to wear, and I didn't know how to wear shoes until I was over twenty." The old worker Tang Ronghe said that he was an apprentice at the age of thirteen. One day, he went to bed at twelve o'clock at night, and got up five minutes late in the morning. The capitalist used a fire hook to burn a hole in his thigh. Later, he was driven out and had to go to the streets to beg for food. He pulled up his trouser leg for everyone to see, and the scar was still there. After recalling and comparing, the new staff and workers were greatly educated, and the evaluation work went smoothly.

Second, grasp situation education. I often go to meetings outside, and I tell everyone about it after I go back. Analyze the current contradictions with Mao Zedong Thought. Once the international situation is discussed, the staff and workers' horizons are broadened. When staff and workers get angry, they are not angry about small things, but about big things, about imperialism, about revisionism. What they think about are major socialist matters and major world revolution matters. Otherwise, if you think about small things a lot, you will inevitably not have time to think about big things, and you will fall into the circle of individualism.

Third, grasp the education of materialist dialectics. Through meetings on application, talk about dialectics. Cadres talk, and workers also talk. Once, during the evaluation of red flags, thirteen people in the trade union committee, twelve people agreed to rate Team One as a "Five-Good Red Flag." Feng Zongfa said: "I don't think it is reasonable for Team One to be rated as a Five-Good Red Flag, because the accidents they had were serious." It was actually a serious accident sign, but they did not take this matter seriously. I suggested taking it to the staff and worker meeting for evaluation. At the meeting, everyone initially thought that Team One could be rated as a Five-Good unit, because they had always been very good, their style was excellent, and besides, the accident sign was not a big problem. Some comrades disagreed with this view and said: "The instrument repair team had a problem, and they went back and found 227 shortcomings, which shows that they have consciousness. You say Team One's style is excellent, so why did the accident sign come out and they didn't go back to find shortcomings? This is a matter of principle." Through discussion, everyone thought that the instrument repair team was still better. The leader of Team One gave the Five-Good Red Flag to the instrument repair team on the spot.

Fourth, grasp revolutionary tradition education. Work hard, and the cadres must take the lead. None of us cadres have any good clothes, and none of us dress up. This also has an impact on the workers. In 1964, when I first arrived on the team, the worker Hu Xuequan would change into clean clothes after he got off work, put on his glasses, and wear his leather shoes. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he understood the principle of building socialism with hard work. Later, he didn't change his clothes after he got off work, and he was also active in his work. Because wearing work clothes he's not afraid of anything, and he can do anything; wearing good clothes, if he sees oil, he has to avoid it. He said: "I didn't come here to wear clothes, I came here to make revolution."

Fifth, grasp cadre leading. To drive the whole team to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, we cadres must first study well. Only if the cadres study well can they use Mao Zedong Thought to educate everyone. To learn well, the first thing is for myself to learn well. I first become a student, and then a teacher. After I have learned well, I will teach others. If you don't demand strict ideological transformation from yourself and ask others to learn, they won't listen to you. We focused on advanced models. With models, everyone can see them and touch them. One instrument vehicle had a bad structure and had been unused for four years, but no one knew exactly what the problems were. The maintenance team studied "Oppose Book Worship" and Chairman Mao's quotations on investigation and research with this problem. Chairman Mao said: "Can't you solve that problem? Then, go and investigate the current state and history of that problem! After you have completely investigated and understood it, you will have a solution to that problem." They disassembled the car and studied it, and found the problem, and only replaced one gear, and this vehicle was used in production. This drove everyone's learning. Later, the workers summarized four sentences, which are: speaking is inseparable from Chairman Mao's thought, discussing things is inseparable from the class viewpoint, working is inseparable from revolutionary drive, and handling affairs is inseparable from the interests of the Party.

Continuously Transform Your Own Thinking

Over the past few years, I have studied Chairman Mao's works and achieved some results. However, the achievements I have made are still far from the requirements of the Party for a Party member. I still have personal distracting thoughts and sometimes consider how to maintain my prestige. If I think too much about my own things, I will think less about the revolutionary cause. Once, a leading comrade in the oilfield said to me: "Zhang Hongchi, after becoming a pacesetter, you can't lie on the red flag, you should carry the red flag and run, carry the red flag and break through. If your head is broken and your nose is bruised, you will come up with experience and lessons. If you break through ten things and eight of them are wrong, you can still get two, but if you don't break through, you won't get any." These words had a great educational effect on me. At that time, I would get nervous when I heard that I was asked to speak at the meeting. Later, I thought, this still contained the word "I". Why do I always think about the word "I"? Why don't I think about making more contributions and thinking of more ways for the cause of the Party and the cause of the people? If you always consider personal gains and losses, you will have burdens. Therefore, living a lifetime, you must read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and transform your thinking for a lifetime. A person will always have problems and contradictions at any time. There will be problems if you are criticized or make mistakes, and there will also be problems if you have achievements or are praised. Thinking about my study of Chairman Mao's works, it is very disproportionate compared to today's revolutionary requirements. The revolution will always be passed on from the older generation to the next generation, which is an inevitable law. This revolutionary burden is on our shoulders, and we must carry it, and we are fully capable of carrying it. The most fundamental guarantee is that we have the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, I will work harder to study Chairman Mao's works, hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on using Mao Zedong Thought to bring out a highly revolutionary team.

### 用毛泽东思想造就革命化的队伍——张洪池同志在石油工业部机关向职工所作的报告摘要

    用毛泽东思想造就革命化的队伍
    ——张洪池同志在石油工业部机关向职工所作的报告摘要
    编者按：突出政治必须落实到人，落实到人的思想革命化。张洪池同志是大庆油田的一位指导员，他对突出政治的重大意义有深刻的领会，认为搞好油田工作的关键是要用毛泽东思想造就一支非常革命化的职工队伍。由于他抓住了政治工作的根本之点，所以作出了出色的成绩。
    我们的一切事业都是群众的事业，都要依靠群众来进行。各项事业的进展，决定于群众和干部的革命化的程度。我们要搞好工业，必须有一支革命化的职工队伍；要搞好农业，必须有一支革命化的农业生产大军，要搞好商业，要搞好文教，要搞好一切事业，都必须有一支革命化的队伍。有了这样一支革命化的队伍，就可以保证党的路线、政策的贯彻执行，就可以创造出任何人间奇迹。
    用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，实现人的思想革命化，这是突出政治的根本目的。目前，我国正在进行着一场无产阶级文化大革命，这是触及人们灵魂的大革命。各个地区、各个部门应当在这场大革命当中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习和运用解放军突出政治的经验，在促进人的思想革命化方面，大大前进一步。
    我原来在勘探指挥部当炊事员。一九六四年调到钻井指挥部测井中队当指导员。测井中队有一百八十四人，分十三个工种。这个队伍经过几年会战，能吃苦，能完成党交给的任务。当然，这个队伍里边也有阶级斗争，有意识形态方面的阶级斗争。面对着这种情况，根据自己几年来的体会，要搞好工作，一定要靠党的领导，要用毛泽东思想武装工人同志，要靠群众的智慧和力量。
    提高阶级觉悟是根本
    在我们中队里，有少数人闹工资待遇，也有嫌测井队苦，要求调动工作的。开始，我都耐心地同他们谈。有的同志认为这是瞎子点灯——白费蜡，对我说：“这些人的问题不难解决。你狠狠地批评他们一顿，就老实了。”我说：“我们不能这样。这些同志是阶级兄弟，他们在旧社会里受阶级压迫，在苦水里长大的。他们只是暂时落后，被资产阶级个人主义这个敌人包围住了，现在还没有觉悟。我们要用毛泽东思想来提高他们的觉悟。”
    当时，比较典型的是王米玉。这个人家庭出身苦，在旧社会受地主压迫，解放后，就参加了革命。象他这样的人，只要加强教育，提高阶级觉悟，他对革命是最坚决的。但是他背了一个出身好的包袱，无组织无纪律，什么都敢干。我把他的情况搞清楚以后，就对他说：“王师傅，你是个老工人，参加革命的时间长。你有责任教育青年一代，你把在旧社会受的苦向青年们讲一下，让在蜜糖里长大的青年受一次教育。”他当时不肯讲。我问他：“你为什么不讲？”他说：“人家会说，你出身那么苦还那么落后。”经过几次启发，他在职工大会上进行了忆苦，教育了大家，他本人也有很大转变。
    可是过了一段时间，问题又来了。有时候队长叫他去做些工作，他不去，和队长顶撞。有的说：“这个同志改不了。”当时我就想，既然他以前那么落后，通过那次忆苦能转变，我相信只要用毛泽东思想把他武装起来，就能够成为自觉的革命者。后来，我就搬到他住的集体宿舍里和他住在一起。有一次，我对他说：“在企业里，贯彻阶级路线就是要依靠老工人，依靠工人阶级的积极分子，所以就要依靠你们呀！你对党的事业总是热爱的吧！我是个新兵，如果我执行党的政策有什么不对的地方，你给我指出来，帮助我，不要使党的事业受到损失。”他说：“不，不，你没有做错。”后来，他自己检查起缺点来了。当他认识到缺点以后，我就用毛主席的话来启发他，给他读了一段毛主席语录。毛主席在《这个乡两年就合作化了》一文的按语里，批评一种人说：“这种人老是被动，在紧要的关头老是止步不前，老是需要别人在他的背上击一猛掌，才肯向前跨进一步。”他听过这段话以后，记住了精神。他和同志们说：“我王米玉革命，老是人家推一下，才走一步，革命不是自觉的。”因为他能听毛主席的话，觉悟进一步提高。我又用自己的实际行动去影响他，他真正转变了。这两年来，连续被评为五好红旗手。
    这使我体会到：长短要用尺来量，轻重要用秤来称，人要用阶级标准来衡量。对待一个阶级兄弟，只要按照毛主席的话去做，用毛泽东思想去武装他，带着深厚的阶级感情去帮助他，提高他的阶级觉悟，他会不断进步的。王米玉的转变，证明提高阶级觉悟是改造一个人的根本。
    要带着阶级感情帮助同志
    中队干部之间，在党支部集体领导下是同级关系。要搞好干部之间的关系，遇事就要通过支部讨论和商量的办法来解决，不能由支部书记把意见强加于人。强扭的瓜不甜，强加于人的意见人家不服。要通过摆事实、讲道理，使每一个干部真正认识到：不按照毛主席的指示办事，是不行的。
    我们队的辛队长，对工作积极热情，很想把工作做好。他走路、吃饭、睡觉，都是想着工作。但是他在管生产中不突出政治。工人说他是“数数队长”。早晨起来，看一看测井数；到井上，看一看曲线条数；到了车场，数一数汽车的台数；晚上，查一查职工人数。他一天到晚就是忙生产，哪里有问题他就顶上去，哪里出了问题他就往哪里跑。我根据毛主席说的要解剖麻雀和抓主要矛盾的指示，劝他说：“我们应该坐下来研究研究，到底存在什么问题。”党支委会研究后，确定开展找差距活动。首先组织力量解剖三小队，就找出了一百三十多条差距，大家思想上震动很大。经过找差距，进行整改，事故减少了，事情好办了。
    有一次，五小队井口工在操作的时候跟别人讲话，仪器拉上来差两厘米就碰到滑轮，幸亏被绞车司机看到了，赶快刹车，防止了仪器落井事故。五小队代理队长任康，回来以后没有汇报。吃午饭的时候，辛队长到五小队去，听到司机在议论。有的说：“今天要给绞车司机立一功。”有的说：“差一点出了事故，还立一功！”辛队长听到后，问了值班干部等七个人，都不知道有这回事。辛队长恼火地说：“非要开个大会，狠狠批评任康一顿不可。”我对他说：“你不要忙于去批评人家，先把事情弄清楚。既要使他受到教育，真正认识错误，又要使大家都受一次教育。”后来几个支委一研究，说：“问题出在工人身上，根子是在干部身上。要开大会，我们先检讨。”因为事故不只是这一次，最近我们出现了几次事故苗头。前些日子八小队把仪器掉到井里去了，停产打捞，给国家造成损失。支委会后，我们首先组织一些骨干讨论：事故是不是可以避免？事故的危害性是什么？然后，我们开职工大会，请老工人讲讲新旧社会对比，又把原来掉下去的那个坏仪器摆在面前。我们讲到这次事故苗头时，大家认识到，这次虽然只差两厘米就要出事故，但是我们的思想早已经掉到井里去了。我们是来革命的，不能给国家造成损失。政治账、经济账一算，大家听了都很沉痛。这时，我就检查自己：“问题出在同志们身上，但根子是在我们干部身上。事故苗头不只是五小队有，其他小队也有。这是个思想和作风问题。我是‘班长’，要带队伍，就要带思想带作风，现在没有把大家带好。我们要把这个坏仪器抬到井场去找原因，找差距。”当时大家都争着抬。把仪器抬走后，大家就议论开了，有的同志被感动得流了眼泪。我们抬着坏仪器跑了十五公里，抬到井场。我们和五小队的同志围着井口找差距，一共找了五十条差距，又学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”大家说：“我们掉了仪器，使人民受了损失，使党受了损失。我们要把坏作风埋在井下，把好作风带回去。”
    当天晚上，我们又开职工大会，整个中队全面找了一次差距，促进了工作。
    多做调查，把根子扎在群众中
    毛主席讲过，没有调查就没有发言权。要放下架子，甘当群众的小学生。我们中队有个技术员叫杨元山，他抓住人家一点缺点，就狠狠批评。有一次，六小队支援三小队一个马达。六小队把一个旧马达给了三小队。杨元山听了三小队的反映后，也不调查，硬说六小队从旧马达上换下了好零件，把六小队整了一顿，叫他们把新的换下来给三小队。这样，六小队当然不服。有一天，我对他说：“老杨，你明天跟我到六小队把情况调查一下。他们这个队为什么老出问题？”我们到了六小队，把问题一个一个调查清楚，写成小故事。我让他把这些问题在职工大会上讲一讲，并对杨元山说：“你也不要批评什么作风不好，对人民不负责任呀等等，你就把一个问题一个问题和大家讲清楚，讲清楚本身就是个批评，大家就会看得明白。”讨论时，大家就说：“杨技术员这次可把问题看准了。过去，老批评我们队作风不好，这样问题，那样问题，对人民不负责任，这次我们才看到问题了。这对我们帮助太大了。”后来，我问老杨，这次调查怎样？他说：“这次调查可深刻了。没有点名批评大家，可是大家都心服口服，收获太大了。以后我不掌握第一手资料就不批评、不表扬。”我说：“不但要把一个个问题摆出来，还要突出政治，用毛泽东思想去分析。你过去分析、解决问题，是就事论事。如果你用毛泽东思想来分析，就给大家上了一堂政治课。”从此以后，这个同志开始认真学习毛主席著作，在工作中注意调查研究了。职工反映说：“我们中队的支部班子是个熔炉。杨元山原来是比较落后的，这一次确实用了毛泽东思想，讲得我们心服口服，讲得我们心里热乎乎的。”
    干部不要把意见强加于人，要让群众自己认识到问题，这就必须按照毛主席的指示办事。有一次我参观油田建设的展览馆，看到模型上一口一口油井，原油是通过转油站送到油库。我当时想：我们队是小队分散单独作业，队干部如果能象油井一样，一个人在一个队，扎在各个小队，深入到群众中，许多情况不是就可以了解清楚了吗？有些干部，家属住在这里，硬叫他住到小队去他不干。开始，只有辛队长、王副指导员和我三个人，分住在三个小队。辛队长在一小队把情况摸得很熟。王副指导员在三小队总结了如何做后进人的工作，并在学习毛主席著作讲用会上，讲了自己的体会。我抓住这两件事，就大讲住在小队的好处。住在小队，职工天天在你的旁边，脑子里就有一个印象，就可以了解他在想些什么。在支委会上，我提出了干部住到小队去的意见。经过讨论，大家都同意了。干部住在小队以后，情况发现得快，摸得清楚，问题也解决得及时，而且使干部经常处在群众监督之下。这样，技术干部做思想工作了，政治干部也了解生产情况了，整个支部班子就拧在一起了。
    关键是要用毛泽东思想造就队伍
    通过两年来学习毛主席著作和实际斗争的锻炼，我认识到干部要想带好队伍，首先要用毛泽东思想武装自己，对党、对人民的事业要无限忠诚、要勤勤恳恳。要依靠党，依靠群众的智慧，依靠群众的力量。
    怎样带领职工活学活用毛主席著作？
    第一、抓阶级教育。用阶级斗争的观点去武装职工头脑。这样学习毛主席著作就能联系实际了。阶级斗争不只是在运动中搞，而且要贯穿到日常行动中、生产中。拿评工资来说，只是给他评钱呢，还是抓阶级教育？领导上认为：主要在于提高职工的觉悟。支部讨论以后也认为要通过这次评级，狠抓一下阶级教育。当时，我们研究确定开展三谈（谈形势、谈认识、谈党的培养）、三比（比旧社会、比农村、比自己对党的贡献）活动。老工人何道来谈着谈着哭起来了。他说：“在旧社会那里有什么评工资的？我十几岁了还没有穿上裤子，二十多岁的人还不知道怎么穿鞋。”老工人唐荣和讲，他十三岁当学徒。有一天，晚上十二点睡觉，早上晚起了五分钟，资本家就用火钩子在他大腿上?了一个洞。后来他被赶了出来，只好到街上去要饭。他把裤腿拉起给大家看，那个伤疤还在。经过回忆对比，对新职工教育很大，评级工作进行得很顺利。
    第二、抓形势教育。我常到外边开会，回去以后给大家讲一讲。用毛泽东思想分析当前的矛盾。一讲国际形势，职工的眼界就开阔了。职工生气就不是生小气，而是生大气了，生帝国主义的气，生修正主义的气。他们想的是社会主义大事，世界革命的大事。不然，小事想的多，大事必然就没空去想，就会钻到个人主义的圈子里去。
    第三、抓唯物辩证法教育。通过讲用会，讲辩证法。干部讲，工人也讲。有一次评红旗，工会委员会十三个人，有十二个人同意把一小队评为五好红旗。冯宗发说：“我看一小队评上五好红旗不合理，他们出的事故是严重的。”实际上是一个严重的事故苗头，但是他们没有认真对待这件事。我就建议拿到职工大会上去评。在会上，开头大家认为一小队可以评为五好单位，因为他们一贯很好，作风过硬，况且那个事故苗头又不是大问题。有的同志就不同意这样看法，说：“仪修班出了问题，回去找了二百二十七条差距，说明他们有觉悟。说一小队作风过硬，为什么出了事故苗头，回去不找差距？这可是个原则性问题。”通过讨论，大家认为还是仪修班过硬。一小队小队长就把五好红旗当场交给仪修班。
    第四、抓革命传统教育。艰苦奋斗，干部要带头。我们几个干部，谁也没有什么好衣服，谁也不打扮。这对工人也有影响。一九六四年，我刚到队上的时候，工人胡学全收工回来，衣服就换得干干净净，戴着眼镜，穿上皮鞋。他学习了毛主席著作，懂得了搞社会主义建设要艰苦奋斗的道理。后来，他下班回来也不换衣服了，工作也积极了。因为穿工作服什么也不怕，干什么都行；穿好衣服一碰见油，就要躲开。他说：“我不是来穿衣服的，我是来革命的。”
    第五、抓干部带头。要带动全队活学活用毛主席著作，首先我们干部要学好。干部学得好，才能用毛泽东思想去教育大家。干部要学好，首先是我自己要学好。我先当学生，后当先生，自己学好了，再去教人家。对于自己的思想改造要求不严，叫人家去学，人家就不听你这一套。我们狠抓了先进样板。有了样板，大家就看得见，摸得着。有一台仪器车构造不好，放了四年没有用，但究竟有些什么毛病，谁也不清楚，保养班带着这个问题学了《反对本本主义》和毛主席有关调查研究的语录。毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”他们把车子拆开研究，就找到了毛病，只换了一个齿轮，这台车子就用到生产上去了。这样就带动了大家的学习。以后工人总结了四句话，就是：讲话不离毛主席思想，论事不离阶级观点，工作不离革命干劲，办事不离党的利益。
    不断改造自己的思想
    这几年来，我学习了毛主席著作，取得了一点成绩。但是，我做出的成绩，和党对一个党员的要求来比，还差得很远。我还有个人杂念，有时考虑怎样保持威信。脑子里想自己的东西多了，想革命事业就少了。有一次，油田一位领导同志对我说：“张洪池，当了标兵以后，不能躺在红旗上，应该扛着红旗跑，扛着红旗闯。你头碰破了，鼻子碰烂了，你就闯出经验教训来了。如果你闯十个事情，有八个闯错了，还能得到两个，如果你不闯的话，一个也得不到。”这些话对我的教育作用很大。当时一听到叫我在大会上讲话就紧张。后来一想，这里面还是包含了“我”字。为什么老考虑“我”字呢？为什么不考虑一下，为党的事业，为人民的事业，多做一些贡献，多想一些办法呢？老考虑个人得失，就会有包袱。所以，活一辈子，要读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想。一个人什么时候都会有问题、有矛盾，受了批评、犯了错误有问题，有了成绩、受了表扬也会有问题。想想自己对毛主席著作的学习，同今天的革命要求来比，很不相称。革命总是要老一代交给下一代的，这是必然规律。这副革命重担就压在我们肩上，我们一定要把它担起来，我们也完全能够担起来。最根本的保证就是我们有伟大的毛泽东思想。今后，我要更加努力学习毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持用毛泽东思想带出一支非常革命化的队伍。
