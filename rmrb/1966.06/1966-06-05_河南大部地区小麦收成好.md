    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 3rd) The vast number of commune members in Henan Province are joyfully harvesting wheat. The area of wheat harvested and threshed in the province has reached over 40 million mu.

    Henan is one of the provinces with the largest wheat planting area in China. Except for some areas in western and northern Henan which experienced reduced production due to drought, most areas of the province have had a good wheat harvest. Across the boundless plains, golden waves roll, the wheat grows tall with large ears. Men and women commune members are busily harvesting, transporting, and threshing.

    Henan suffered from drought around the time of wheat sowing last year, and some areas were still dry this spring. However, the vast number of cadres and commune members in the rural areas of the province launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works last autumn, and this spring they widely carried out activities to learn from the heroic deeds of Jiao Yulu, resulting in a tremendous change in their spiritual outlook, and establishing the idea of farming for the revolution. Thus, under unfavorable natural conditions, they made full use of existing water conservancy facilities to fight drought during sowing and protect seedlings; and they tried every means to tap water sources and expand the irrigated area. In the plains areas suitable for well-digging, a high tide of well and spring construction was universally launched; in the newly built canal irrigation areas, intensive canal supporting projects were carried out. These two water conservancy projects alone expanded the irrigated area in the province by more than 6 million mu. In the mountainous and hilly areas, the masses also built more than 40,000 water cellars (dry wells) and ponds, and more than 1,800 small reservoirs and large ponds with a water capacity of more than 10,000 cubic meters this past winter and spring. With so many water conservancy projects, the irrigated area of wheat fields throughout the province has increased many times over the past.

    In this year's wheat production, the vast number of rural commune members broke with many years of old habits and vigorously promoted advanced agricultural technologies. In the past, areas that were not accustomed to applying base fertilizer to wheat fields applied base fertilizer, and the area of fertilized wheat fields accounted for about 60%. In many areas, only drought-resistant waterings were done in the past, but now both drought-resistant waterings and yield-increasing waterings are being done.

### 河南大部地区小麦收成好

    河南大部地区小麦收成好
    据新华社郑州三日电　河南省广大农村社员正在喜气洋洋地收割小麦。全省收割登场的小麦已达四千多万亩。
    河南是我国小麦种植面积最大的一个省份。除了豫西和豫北的一部分地区因受旱减产以外，全省大部分地区的小麦获得了好收成。一望无际的大平原上，金浪滚滚，小麦长得棵高穗大，男女社员们一面紧张地收割，一面迅速地装运和碾打。
    去年小麦播种前后河南就旱，今春部分地区仍旱。但是，全省农村广大干部和社员，从去年秋季就掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，今年春天又广泛地开展了学习焦裕禄英雄事迹的活动，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，树立了为革命种田的思想。从而在不利的自然条件下，充分利用现有水利设施，抗旱播种，抗旱保苗；并且千方百计地挖掘水源，扩大灌溉面积。适宜打井的平原地区，普遍掀起了井泉建设高潮；新建的渠灌区，大力进行了灌渠配套工程。只这两项水利建设，全省就扩大了灌溉面积六百多万亩。山区和丘陵地区的群众，在去冬今春还修了水窖（旱井）和涝池四万多个，小水库和容水万方以上的大水塘一千八百多个。有了这样多的水利工程，就使得全省的麦田灌溉面积比往年成倍地增加。
    广大农村社员在今年小麦生产中，打破了许多年来的陈旧习惯，大力推广了先进的农业技术。过去，不习惯施麦田底肥的地方，施了底肥，施肥的麦田面积占百分之六十左右。不少地区，过去只浇抗旱水，现在既浇了抗旱水，又浇了增产水。
