    Using Literary Weapons to Fiercely Attack Class Enemies
    The "Ode to the Five Goods, Sing of the Advanced" Theatrical Performance of the Xiamen Municipal Finance and Trade System Employees Fully Demonstrates the Role of the Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers as the Main Force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Giving the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Line the Most Powerful Counterattack
    The employees of the Xiamen Municipal Finance and Trade System recently held a "Ode to the Five Goods, Sing of the Advanced" theatrical performance. With boundless reverence for the great leader Chairman Mao, boundless love for the socialist system, and strong class feelings, they broke down superstitions, dared to explore and create, and self-composed, self-sang, and self-performed many programs, fully demonstrating the role of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, giving the anti-Party and anti-Socialist black line a powerful counterattack.
    The programs in this performance were collectively created and directed by more than two hundred employees from twenty-four enterprises in Xiamen. Many programs are vivid and lively, short and concise, and full of fighting atmosphere. For example, the comic dialogue "Serving the Counter for Revolution" and the comic dialogue "Grasping the Socialist Abacus Tightly," reflecting the revolutionary spirit of commercial workers who hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, are stationed at the counter, have the motherland in their hearts, and have the world in view; the dance "Capturing the Enemy at Sea," reflecting the broad masses of fishermen with full of class hatred, increasing vigilance a hundredfold, and persisting in the struggle against the enemy at sea; the drum ballad performance "Fish Hook Quality Dares to be Higher than Norway's," reflecting self-reliance, hard work, daring to think and dare to break through, creating brilliant achievements in the Great Leap Forward, and the collective recitation "Spring Breeze Battle Song"; as well as the quick-board rap "Singing Green Island," reflecting the advanced deeds of finance and trade workers who are not afraid of hardship or fatigue, wholeheartedly for the revolution, supporting industrial and agricultural production, and serving the people's lives, the female chorus "Red Foreign Trade Workers," and the comic dialogue "Red Granary Keepers," etc., have all been warmly praised.
    The process of the Xiamen Municipal Finance and Trade Department employees carrying out amateur literary and artistic activities has struggled against all kinds of bourgeois ideas. In the past, some people believed that finance and trade employees were "roughnecks" standing at the counter, "did not understand art," and these people looked down on the "small trinkets" of employee amateur art. Some people also advocated that employees' amateur literary and artistic activities should be divorced from reality and engage in large-scale, foreign-style activities. In the past one or two years, the broad masses of finance and trade employees have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on literature and art, and clarified that it is a major historical task for workers, peasants, and soldiers to be the masters of socialist culture. They are determined to hold the literary and artistic weapons in their own hands, participate in the class struggle, and, under the leadership of the Party organization, enthusiastically compiled and performed many good programs reflecting the actual struggle life. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the amateur literary and artistic activists of the Xiamen Finance and Trade System repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Literature and art should be well integrated into the entire revolutionary machine as a component part, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy, and helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind." Understand that workers, peasants, and soldiers should use amateur literary and artistic activities to promote Mao Zedong Thought, occupy and expand the ideological and cultural positions of the proletariat, and carry out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Everyone has a clear direction, full of confidence, compiled and performed a large number of programs, enthusiastically singing the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao, singing the praises of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the new era of heroic figures, and used practical actions to fight back against the anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons.
    Not only employees but also family members actively participate in the amateur literary and artistic activities of the Xiamen Finance and Trade System. At the theatrical performance, thirty-seven fishermen's family members from the Fishing Commune sang revolutionary songs such as "Sailing the Sea Depends on the Helmsman" and "Fishermen's Family Members Make Revolution" with fiery class feelings, expressing the fishermen's women's boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. The average age of this family chorus is fifty-two years old, and they are all people who have suffered the bitterness of blood and tears in the old society. They said: In the old society, our fishermen were called "sea-begging pigs" by the reactionaries and feudal fishing tyrants. Today, we have completely turned ourselves over and become masters of our own affairs. We must go on stage to sing about the happiness brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. At this moment of defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending the Party, and sweeping away anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, their emotions are particularly agitated, and the more they sing, the more energetic they become. The singing on the stage is exciting, and the applause under the stage is thunderous. (Xinhua News Agency)

    用文艺武器狠狠打击阶级敌人
    厦门市财贸系统职工举行的“颂五好、唱先进”文艺观摩演唱专场，充分显示出广大工农兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的主力军作用，给反党反社会主义的黑线以最有力回击
    厦门市财贸系统职工最近举行了“颂五好、唱先进”文艺观摩演唱专场。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比崇敬，对社会主义制度的无比热爱和强烈的阶级感情，破除迷信，敢闯敢创，自编、自唱、自演了许多节目，充分显示出广大工农兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的主力军作用，给反党反社会主义的黑线以有力回击。
    这次观摩演出的节目，是厦门市二十四个企业单位的二百多个职工集体创作和导演的。许多节目鲜明生动、短小精干，富有战斗气氛。如反映商业工作者高举毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，身在柜台，胸怀祖国，放眼世界的革命气魄的对口剧《为革命站柜台》和对口词《紧握社会主义算盘》；反映广大渔民群众满怀阶级仇恨，百倍提高警惕，坚持海上对敌斗争的舞蹈《海上捕俘》；反映自力更生、奋发图强，敢想敢闯，创造大跃进光辉业绩的锣鼓词表演《鱼钩质量敢与挪威比高低》、集体朗诵《春风战歌》；以及反映财贸职工不怕苦，不怕累，一心为革命，支援工农业生产、为人民生活服务等先进事例的快板《唱绿岛》、女声小合唱《红色的外贸职工》、对口词《红色粮仓保管员》等，都受到热烈赞扬。
    厦门市财贸部门职工开展业余文艺活动的过程，曾经同形形色色的资产阶级思想作过斗争。过去，曾经有人认为财贸职工是站柜台的“大老粗”，“不懂艺术”，这些人对职工业余文艺的“小玩艺”看不上眼。也有的人主张职工业余文艺活动脱离实际地搞大型的、洋的。近一二年来，广大财贸职工认真学习了毛主席关于文艺问题的指示，明确了工农兵做社会主义文化的主人是一个重大的历史任务。他们决心把文艺武器掌握在自己手中，参加阶级斗争，并且在党组织领导下满腔热情地编演了许多反映现实斗争生活的好节目。在无产阶级文化大革命中，厦门财贸系统职工业余文艺活动积极分子反复学习了毛主席的教导：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”懂得工农兵应该通过业余文艺活动宣传毛泽东思想，占领和扩大无产阶级思想文化阵地，开展兴无灭资的斗争。大家方向明确，信心很足，自己编演了大批节目，热情地歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂工农业生产大跃进和英雄辈出的新时代，用实际行动回击了反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神。
    厦门财贸系统的业余文艺活动不仅职工参加，家属也积极参加。在观摩演唱会上，来自渔捞公社的三十七个渔民家属以火热的阶级感情演唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《渔民家属闹革命》等革命歌曲，表达了渔家妇女对党和毛主席的无比热爱。这支家属合唱队的平均年龄五十二岁，都是饱受旧社会辛酸血泪苦的人，她们说：在旧社会，我们渔民被反动派和封建渔霸叫做“讨海猪”，今天我们彻底翻身，当家做主，一定要上台歌唱共产党、毛主席给我们带来的幸福。在这捍卫毛泽东思想、捍卫党，横扫反党反社会主义牛鬼蛇神的时刻，她们的情绪分外激昂，越唱越有劲，台上歌声激荡，台下掌声雷鸣。　（新华社）
