    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th dispatch. Our reporter reports: A revolutionary movement for ideological emancipation, in which emancipated farmers and herdsmen in Tibet are smashing the ideological shackles of the feudal serf system, is unfolding throughout the region. The encirclement and annihilation of ground squirrels, long-term pests called "divine rats," by more than 100,000 emancipated farmers and herdsmen in the Lhasa River valley is a revolution to eliminate old ideas. This mass movement to change customs and habits lasted more than two months and recently concluded, with most of the ground squirrels on more than 300,000 *ke* (acres) of land being eliminated.

    Rat infestation is a major disaster for agricultural and pastoral production in Tibet. According to a survey by the Tibetan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, there are two to three thousand rat holes per hectare of cultivated land on the Lhasa Plain. Ground squirrels damage cultivated land, irrigation canals, and pastures, gnaw on seedlings, and steal grain, seriously affecting agricultural and pastoral production.

    However, rat infestation and other insect pests, diseases, etc., have been protected by the Tibetan serf system for centuries. The reporter heard statements like this everywhere in the rural areas of Lhasa: ground squirrels are "reincarnations of lamas" and "lice on living Buddhas." The serf-owner class has long used temples to vigorously promote these ideas, paralyzing the working people, making them resigned to fate, and forever subjecting them to ignorance and oppression.

    After the revolution, Tibetan emancipated peasants became masters of their own affairs, and their ideological consciousness underwent profound changes. They not only had the power to smash the serf system, but also relied on the organized collective power to bravely declare war on old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that harmed the people and hindered the development of production. Since the beginning of spring this year, the reporter has seen male and female farmers and herdsmen in the Lhasa River valley, uniting village by village, township by township, and county by county, to launch a massive encirclement and annihilation war against the "divine rats" sealed by the feudal serf system, leaving the pests with nowhere to hide. While fighting the "divine rats," farmers in many villages also carried out activities to eliminate underground insects and diseases.

    What has driven the Tibetan emancipated peasants to abandon old ideas is the revolutionary practice guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought. Emancipated peasants love the Party and Chairman Mao, and love Chairman Mao's works. In the vast rural areas, reading Chairman Mao's books and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions has become a common practice. Everywhere, one hears comments like, "The Dalai's sutras are recited for the serf owners, and Chairman Mao's words are spoken for us," and "Chairman Mao's works are the omnipotent golden key." Emancipated peasants use Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle and the viewpoint of materialist dialectics to carry out production and construction and scientific experiments. They are not afraid of "gods," not afraid of "ghosts," not afraid of all kinds of pests, and they fight against the residual influence of the feudal serf system.

    In Zhangduo Township, Dazi County, in the lower reaches of the Lhasa River, the reporter saw male and female farmers encircling and annihilating ground squirrels on the last piece of farmland. People carried small cans, arrayed in a long line, using spoons to place poisoned bait in the rat holes. Thirty-nine-year-old poor peasant Ciren Dunzhu told the reporter, "This is an enemy without guns. If we don't eliminate it, it will harm us for a lifetime!" Ciren Dunzhu told us about his views on "gods and ghosts." This herdsman from the northern Tibetan grasslands only gained emancipation after being a slave for twenty-seven years. After the revolution, he was elected as the mutual aid team leader. He began to be emancipated politically and economically, but ideologically he was still bound and oppressed by old ideas and old habits. Class enemies used his religious superstitions to obstruct the adoption of new farm tools and the acceptance of advanced technologies for eradicating rat infestations, insect pests, and diseases. They spread rumors that killing would anger the gods and ghosts, that one would be reincarnated as cattle and horses in the next life, that the more rats were killed, the more would appear, and so on. He was temporarily misled. As a result, the production of the entire team quickly lagged behind other teams that adopted new technologies. His wife also died at childbirth at the hands of lamas who chanted scriptures. Last winter and this spring, he studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone, and he further realized that this was class struggle. He told the reporter: Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. The enemy still wants to use our old ideas to fool us and ride on our necks. I will never listen to their nonsense again.

    The fact that emancipated farmers and herdsmen have begun to believe in science and materialism has caused the remaining ideological rule of the Tibetan feudal serf system to be in a state of great collapse.

    In Xiongduo Township, Linzhou County, farmers fought "divine rats" to protect crops and dug canals on "divine mountains," and as a result, the crops grew very well. In a field infested with insects in Dazi County, enlightened farmers sprinkled 666 pesticide powder on one side of the land to kill the insects, while shamans chanted scriptures and performed rituals on the other side; a few hours later, the shamans had no choice but to sneak away.

    The fact that the emancipated serfs of Tibet dare to break "theocracy," dare to break with the remaining ideas of the feudal serf system, and dare to trample those monsters and demons in the ideological field under their feet and ridicule them is a new awakening of the emancipated serfs, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the plateau, and has great significance.

### 毛泽东思想推动西藏翻身农奴大破“神权”  拉萨河流域十多万农牧民围歼长期为患被称为“神鼠”的地老鼠

    毛泽东思想推动西藏翻身农奴大破“神权”
    拉萨河流域十多万农牧民围歼长期为患被称为“神鼠”的地老鼠
    据新华社拉萨二十日电  本社记者报道：西藏翻身农牧民砸碎封建农奴制度的思想枷锁，争取思想大解放的革命运动正在各地展开。拉萨河流域十多万翻身农牧民围歼长期为患的被称为“神鼠”的地老鼠，就是一场破除旧思想的革命。这一群众性的移风易俗活动，历时两个多月，已在最近结束，三十多万克（亩）土地上的地鼠大部分被消灭。
    鼠害是西藏地区农牧业生产上的一大灾害。据西藏农业科学研究所调查，拉萨平原上每公顷耕地就有鼠洞两三千个。地鼠破坏耕地、水渠、草场，啃食幼苗，盗窃粮食，使农牧业生产受到严重影响。
    但是，鼠害和其它虫害、病害，等等，千百年来都受到西藏农奴制度的保护。记者在拉萨农村到处听到这样的说法：地老鼠是“喇嘛转世”、“活佛身上的虱子”，农奴主阶级长期以来通过寺庙大肆宣扬，麻痹劳动人民，让他们听天由命，永远受愚弄和压迫。
    革命后，西藏翻身农民当家作主，思想意识发生了深刻的变化。他们不但有力量砸碎农奴制度；而且依靠组织起来的集体力量，勇敢地向危害人民、束缚生产发展的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯宣战。今年开春以来，记者看到拉萨河流域的男女农民、牧民，村与村、乡与乡、县与县，普遍联合起来，向封建农奴制度封的“神鼠”展开声势浩大的围歼战，使害鼠无藏身之地。许多村庄的农民在和“神鼠”斗争的同时，还开展了灭地下虫，灭病害等活动。
    推动西藏翻身农民抛弃旧思想的是在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下的革命实践。翻身农民热爱党和毛主席，热爱毛主席著作。在广大农村，读毛主席的书，按毛主席的指示办事，已经蔚然成风，到处听到这样的议论：“达赖的经是为农奴主念的，毛主席的话是为我们说的”，“毛主席著作是万能的金钥匙”。翻身农民运用毛主席的关于阶级斗争的学说，关于唯物辩证法的观点，去进行生产建设和科学实验活动，不怕“神”，不怕“鬼”，不怕一切害人虫，和封建农奴制度的残余影响作斗争。
    记者在拉萨河下游的达孜县张多乡，看到男女农民正在围歼最后一片农田上的地老鼠。人们提着小罐，摆开一字长蛇阵，用勺子往鼠洞里放毒饵。三十九岁的贫农次仁顿珠对记者说：“这是不拿枪的敌人，不消灭它，它要害我们一辈子！”次仁顿珠给我们讲起他对“神鬼”的看法。这位藏北草原的牧民，当了二十七年奴隶才翻身。革命后，他当选为互助组长。他在政治上、经济上开始翻身，但在思想上还受旧思想、旧习惯的束缚和压迫。阶级敌人利用他的宗教迷信观念，阻挠采用新式农具和接受根治鼠害、虫害和病害等先进技术。他们造谣说，杀生要触怒神鬼，来世要变牛马，老鼠越灭越多，等等。他一时受到了迷惑，结果，全组生产很快落后于其他一些采用新技术的组。他的妻子在难产时，也死于念经的喇嘛之手。去冬今春，他和大伙一起学习毛主席著作，才进一步认识到这是阶级斗争。他对记者说：毛主席的话千真万确，敌人还想利用我们的旧思想来愚弄我们，骑在我们脖子上。我是再也不听信他们那套鬼话了。
    翻身农牧民开始相信科学，相信唯物论，使得西藏封建农奴制度残存的思想统治处于大崩溃之中。
    在林周县雄多乡，农民们斗“神鼠”保庄稼，在“神山”上动土修渠，结果庄稼长得很好。在达孜县的一块受虫灾的地里，觉悟了的农民在半边地上撒六六六药粉灭了虫，巫师们在另半边地上念经作法；几小时后，巫师们只好偷偷溜走。
    西藏翻身农奴敢于破“神权”，敢于同封建农奴制度的残余思想决裂，敢于把那些意识形态领域里的牛鬼蛇神踩在脚底下，奚落他们，这是翻身农奴的新觉醒，是毛泽东思想在高原上的新胜利，是有着伟大意义的。
