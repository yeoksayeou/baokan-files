    Cultural Revolution, We Must Charge Forward!
　　Worker of Taiyuan Tool Factory　Zheng Kai
    The red flag flutters, the east wind blows,
    The tide of the Cultural Revolution surges;
    We are the main force of the three great revolutions,
    We must also charge forward in the Cultural Revolution!
    Chairman Mao's teachings are kept in mind,
    Class struggle is never forgotten for a moment;
    Whoever stirs up trouble and attacks the Party,
    We will resolutely struggle and show no mercy!
    What "authorities," "scholars," "celebrities,"
    Are just putting on airs to scare people!
    We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought,
    We have the demon-revealing mirror of class struggle.
    We can smash open attacks with guns and bullets,
    Hidden arrows and dark winds cannot shake us in the slightest,
    Thirty-six stratagems, no matter which trick you use,
    Our eyes see them clearly!
    History is created by the working people,
    The working people are the true masters of culture,
    Raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher,
    And thoroughly eliminate all the monsters and demons!

    文化大革命，咱要打冲锋！
　　太原工具厂工人　郑楷
    红旗飘飘舞东风，
    文化革命浪潮涌；
    我们是三大革命的主力军，
    文化大革命咱也要打冲锋！
    毛主席教导记在心，
    一刻也不忘阶级斗争；
    谁要兴风作浪攻击党，
    坚决斗争绝不留情！
    什么“权威”、“学者”、“名流”，
    不过是装腔作势来吓人！
    我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，
    我们有阶级斗争的照妖镜。
    明枪明弹，咱能把它击得粉碎，
    暗箭黑风，也动不了咱毫毛半根，
    三十六计，不管你们用的哪种诡计，
    我们的眼睛看得分明！
    历史本是劳动人民创造，
    劳动人民才是文化的真主人，
    更高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，
    把牛鬼蛇神彻底肃清！
