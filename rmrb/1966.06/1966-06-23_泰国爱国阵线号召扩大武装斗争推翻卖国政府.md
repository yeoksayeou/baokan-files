    Revolution's central task and highest form is armed seizure of power; it is the resolution of problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad; it is correct in all cases.
    Patriotic Front of Thailand Calls for Expanding Armed Struggle to Overthrow Traitorous Government
    Statement condemns Thanom government's participation in US imperialist aggression against Vietnam, pointing out: Since the Thanom government participates in the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people have the right to pursue and eliminate the enemy within Thai territory; once the war expands, it will not be diverted by the subjective wishes of the Thanom government and US imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd – Paron Chularat, the overseas representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand in Beijing, provided Xinhua News Agency with a statement issued by the Patriotic Front of Thailand on May 8th, condemning the Thai Thanom-Praphat government for sending troops to participate in the US imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam. The statement called on the Thai people to rise up and oppose this heinous crime of the Thanom-Praphat government.

    The statement said that the Thanom-Praphat government's brazen decision to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam is the most despicable and filthy decision. "It shows that the Thanom-Praphat government has further sold out Thailand to US imperialism, even disregarding the serious consequences that it will bring to the Thai nation and people, shamelessly taking the lives of the Thai people and the property of the nation to serve imperialism."

    The statement said: "This act of the Thanom-Praphat government is a rogue act that completely violates the interests of the Thai nation and goes against the will of the Thai people. It is an arrogant and reckless act of bringing wolves into the house, and it will bring great disasters to the nation and the people."

    The statement said: "Since the Thanom-Praphat government can invade the borders of other countries to trample on and destroy the national sovereignty of Vietnam, then the Vietnamese people also have every legitimate right to rise up, resist, and pursue and eliminate the enemy within Thai territory, just as the Thanom-Praphat government has done to the Vietnamese people." "The Thanom-Praphat government and its American masters wishfully want to lead the war to develop in a direction favorable to them. However, once the Vietnam War expands into a large-scale war, neither the Thanom-Praphat government nor US imperialism itself can drive the war to shift according to their subjective wishes."

    The statement, in discussing the plight of the Thai people under the exploitation and oppression of the Thanom-Praphat government, said: "The Patriotic Front of Thailand takes this opportunity to appeal to all compatriots to unite and carry out various forms of struggle, resolutely oppose and stop the Thanom-Praphat government from participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam and serving the conspiracy to expand the Vietnam War. We especially want to appeal to the officers and soldiers of all units of the National Defense Forces to resolutely refuse to participate in the heinous crimes of the Thanom-Praphat government, and to resolutely rise up to fight against forcing you to go to the South Vietnamese battlefield or other areas to act as cannon fodder for US imperialism."

    "Now, the people of the Northeast and South (of Thailand) have already risen up to fight against the tyranny of the Thanom-Praphat government. The people are forced to take up arms to defend themselves. The struggle of the people in the Northeast and South is a brilliant example for the people of the whole country. The Thanom-Praphat government uses violence to maintain their ruling position and uses armed forces to suppress the people; they are armed to the teeth. If the people do not have their own armed forces, they cannot defeat them. We appeal to the people of the whole country to fully support the armed struggle of the people in the Northeast and South, and to be prepared at any necessary moment to carry out armed struggle like the people in the Northeast and South!"

    The statement, in the name of all patriotic Thai people, expressed to the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia: The Thai people will certainly work together with them and fight side by side to completely defeat the common enemy – the US imperialist policy of aggression and war!

    Xinhua News Agency, June 18th – Bangkok dispatch: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station said in a commentary published on the 16th that US imperialism is a paper tiger, and the thirty million Thai people will certainly be able to defeat US imperialism just like the people of South Vietnam are doing now.

    The commentary said that US imperialist aggression is being met with increasingly fierce opposition from the Thai people. Therefore, it is continuously sending troops into Thailand in order to collude with the Thanom-Praphat group to suppress the Thai people.

    The commentary said that US imperialism's increasing troops in Thailand, in addition to exposing its aggressive face, also exposes the essence of its paper tiger, showing that it is very afraid of the growing strength of the Thai people, who are increasingly awakening and widely rising up to carry out a struggle for national salvation.

    The commentary emphasized: No matter how many troops US imperialism sends to be enemies with the Thai people and slaughter the Thai people, it certainly cannot escape the fate of extinction. The commentary said that the Thai people have their own experience in fighting against US imperialism, and are also learning from the struggle experiences of the people of various countries. Since the fourteen million people of South Vietnam are able to defeat US imperialism, the thirty million Thai people, as long as they dare to rise up and fight, will certainly be able to defeat US imperialism.

    The commentary pointed out that US imperialism's wishful thinking of permanently occupying Thailand and using Thailand as a base for its aggression will eventually be shattered by the Thai people. If the US invading troops do not withdraw from Thailand immediately, they will suffer the same fate as they have in South Vietnam, and in the end, they will all be buried in the land of Thailand.

### 泰国爱国阵线号召扩大武装斗争推翻卖国政府

    革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。
    泰国爱国阵线号召扩大武装斗争推翻卖国政府
    声明谴责他侬政府参与美帝侵越战争，指出：既然他侬政府参与侵越战争，越南人民就有权追击和消灭敌人于泰国境内；战争一旦扩大，就不会以他侬政府和美帝的主观愿望而转移
    新华社二十二日讯　在北京的泰国爱国阵线驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖向新华社提供了泰国爱国阵线五月八日发表的一项声明，谴责泰国他侬—巴博政府派兵参加美帝国主义在越南进行的侵略战争。声明号召泰国人民起来反对他侬—巴博政府的这一滔天罪行。
    声明说，他侬—巴博政府关于派兵参加侵略越南战争这一肆无忌惮的决议，是最卑鄙龌龊的决议。“它说明他侬—巴博政府更进一步把泰国出卖给美帝国主义，甚至不顾将会给泰国国家和人民带来什么样的严重后果，恬不知耻地拿泰国人民的生命和国家的财产去为帝国主义效劳。”
    声明说：“他侬—巴博政府这一行径，是一种完全违反泰国国家利益和违背泰国人民的意愿的流氓行径，是一种嚣张狂妄的引狼入室的行径，它将给国家人民带来巨大的灾难。”
    声明说：“既然他侬—巴博政府可以侵入别人的国境去蹂躏和破坏越南的国家主权，那么越南人民也完全有正当的权利，起来反抗并追击和消灭敌人于泰国境内，正如他侬—巴博政府对越南人民所做的一样。”“他侬—巴博政府及其美国主子，一厢情愿地想把战争引向对他们有利的方面发展。但是，越南战争一旦扩大为大规模的战争的时候，无论他侬—巴博政府，或者是美帝国主义本身，谁也不能驱使战争依照他们的主观愿望转移。”
    声明在谈到泰国人民在他侬—巴博政府榨取和镇压下水深火热的情况后说：“泰国爱国阵线借此机会，呼吁全国同胞团结起来，进行各式各样的斗争，坚决反对和制止他侬—巴博政府参与侵略越南的战争和为扩大越南战争的阴谋效劳。我们特别要向国防军各部队官兵兄弟们呼吁，坚决起来拒绝参与他侬—巴博政府的滔天罪行，坚决起来为反对强迫你们到南越战场或其它地区充当美帝国主义的替死鬼而斗争。”
    “现在，（泰国）东北部和南部人民，已经起来和他侬—巴博政府的暴政进行斗争。人民被迫拿起武器进行自卫。东北部和南部人民的斗争，是全国人民的光辉榜样。他侬—巴博政府以暴力来维持他们的统治地位，用武装来镇压人民，他们已武装到牙齿。人民如果没有自己的武装，就不能战胜他们。我们向全国人民呼吁，全力支援东北部和南部人民的武装斗争，随时准备在必要的时刻，象东北部和南部人民一样进行武装斗争！”
    声明以全泰国爱国人民的名义，向越南、老挝和柬埔寨人民表示：泰国人民一定和他们同心协力并肩战斗，彻底打败共同敌人——美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策！
    新华社十八日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十六日在发表的一篇评论中说，美帝国主义是纸老虎，三千万泰国人民一定能象现在南越人民一样战胜美帝国主义。
    评论说，美帝国主义的侵略正遭到泰国人民越来越猛烈的反对，因此它源源不断地把军队开进泰国，以便勾结他侬—巴博集团一起镇压泰国人民。
    评论说，美帝国主义增兵泰国除了暴露它的侵略面目以外，也暴露了它的纸老虎的本质，说明它对于日益觉醒、并广泛地起来进行救国斗争的泰国人民力量的不断壮大感到十分害怕。
    评论强调：不管美帝国主义要派多少军队来同泰国人民为敌，残杀泰国人民，它肯定不能逃脱灭亡的命运。评论说，泰国人民有自己同美帝国主义斗争的经验，同时也在学习各国人民的斗争经验。既然一千四百万南越人民能够战胜美帝国主义，三千万泰国人民只要敢于起来斗争，也一定能够战胜美帝国主义。
    评论指出，美帝国主义妄想永久占领泰国并利用泰国作为它进行侵略的基地的如意算盘，终将被泰国人民粉碎。美国侵略军如果不立即从泰国撤退，它就要遭到同它在南越一样的命运，最后一定要全部被埋葬在泰国的土地上。
