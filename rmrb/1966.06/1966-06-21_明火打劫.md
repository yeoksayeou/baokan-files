　　The South Vietnamese puppet regime announced a 50 percent devaluation of its fake currency. It is said that this measure is to curb inflation in South Vietnam, which is complete nonsense.
　　The South Vietnamese puppet clique has been issuing banknotes indiscriminately, and inflation has become increasingly serious, causing the people to suffer unspeakably. Now, it has announced a 50 percent devaluation of its fake currency, instantly reducing the total value of the banknotes it issued by half. Even the Associated Press has had to admit that this open robbery is the "heaviest blow" to the lives of the people in the US-puppet occupied areas of South Vietnam. It seems that the South Vietnamese puppet clique, nearing its doomsday, is becoming even more unscrupulous in order to save its tottering rule.

    明火打劫
    南越傀儡政权宣布伪币贬值百分之五十。据说这一措施是为了制止南越的通货膨胀，这完全是一派谎言。
    南越傀儡集团滥发钞票，通货膨胀日益严重，人民苦不堪言。现在，它宣布伪币贬值百分之五十，一下子就把它所发行的钞票总值减少了一半。这种明火打劫的办法，连美联社都不得不承认，是对南越美伪占区人民生活的“最重打击”。看来，临近末日的南越傀儡集团，为了挽救它摇摇欲坠的统治，更加不择手段了。
