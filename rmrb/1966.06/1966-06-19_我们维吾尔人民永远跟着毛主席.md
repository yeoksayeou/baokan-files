    Hearing that the Deng Tuo gang was vehemently opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in Beijing, I was instantly trembling with anger, my blood rushing to my head. I rushed into the house in one breath, and carefully looked at each of the seven Chairman Mao portraits posted on the three walls, and mumbled a few words to him before I felt a little more comfortable. After that, for many days, one thought kept going around in my mind: No way! I'm going to lead my two sons to Beijing to fight those black gangs! Mao Zedong Thought is the ever-shining red sun in our hearts. The Deng Tuo gang opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, they are trying to remove the red sun from our hearts. You really have some nerve! Let me tell you, Mao Zedong Thought has already taken root in Kurban Tulum's heart and in the hearts of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. To take away the red sun in our hearts is harder than climbing to heaven. I am already over eighty years old this year, and many people who know me are surprised. How come Kurban Tulum is getting tougher as he gets older, and has been a labor model every year, and even cut off his long beard? Actually, it’s not strange at all, it’s because there is an ever-shining red sun in my heart! Since I returned from Beijing after seeing Chairman Mao twice, my heart has never left Chairman Mao for a moment. During the day, when I cut reeds and chop reeds for the team, I think of Chairman Mao and feel an inexhaustible strength. Sometimes, when I finish work and go home to eat, I look up and see the portrait of Chairman Mao, and I run out to work for a while before coming back to eat. I also miss Chairman Mao at night. Just over a month ago, when the new highway was just completed, I dreamed that a car drove on the new highway and stopped in front of my house. Chairman Mao, whom I missed day and night, was surrounded by a red glow, walking towards me, and I rushed forward to greet him with ecstasy....

    I, Kurban Tulum, cannot leave Chairman Mao for a moment. When the peaches, apricots, and grapes in the orchard are ripe, I always want to keep the best ones and find a way to send them to Chairman Mao. Last year, I specifically planted a lot of cantaloupes, preparing to send them to Chairman Mao, but I never had the opportunity, which made me very anxious. Fortunately, Chairman Liu and Vice Premier Chen Yi came to Hotan, and I was very happy to entrust them to send two. The small cloth hat I wore when I first met Chairman Mao eight years ago, although it is old, I still wear it often. The "Hurjun" (back strap) that contained the gifts I sent to Chairman Mao, and the single-layer jacket I wore to see Chairman Mao, I have kept them well and take them out to look at from time to time. Why do I post seven Chairman Mao portraits in the house? Because this way I can see him no matter which way I face. Every day, I look at the portrait of Chairman Mao, and I shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" countless times in my heart!

    Trees have roots, and water has a source. My Kurban Tulum's love for Chairman Mao did not come out of thin air. The Deng Tuo gang of anti-Party elements likes to talk about history, so I will talk to you about history. I, Kurban Tulum, lived in the old society for more than sixty years, more than forty of which were spent in the animal pens and dugouts of the bayi (landlords), serving as a stepping stone for the bayi to mount horses, washing the bayi's body, sitting in the bayi's private prison.... What kind of humiliation have I, Kurban Tulum, not suffered! The bayi family slaughtered a sheep every few days, and I thought I could always get some soup to drink, no, they even soaked steamed buns to feed the dogs. At that time, we poor people didn't even have a proper name. My father's name was Tulum, which means sheepskin bag. That was not my father's real name. It was an insulting nickname given by the bayi because he accused my father of eating too much! I worked for the bayi for more than forty years, and in the end, I was left with a body full of debts.

    Let’s look at Kurban Tulum’s current life: I live in a snow-white house, eat white flour and fruit, and drink milk. I was also elected as a representative of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People’s Congress and a regional labor model. The changes in my hometown are also very great. In the past, some poor people here couldn’t even afford coarse cloth clothes, let alone quilts. Now everyone wears fine cloth and silk clothes, and every family has quilts. In the past, poor people couldn’t even afford a hoe, but now we have all kinds of new farm tools, and we also have tractors. My eldest son is also a tractor driver. In the past, this place was dry and lacked water, and poor people had to be exploited by the bayis even for drinking water. Now the brigade has built a new canal, which can ensure a good harvest even in dry years. Before 1957, our brigade still needed the state to supply grain. From 1959, we had surplus grain to sell to the state. Our brigade is an ordinary brigade in Hotan County. Which place in the entire Hotan and the entire Xinjiang has not undergone earth-shaking changes like our brigade! Every one of such great changes to me, Kurban Tulum, and my hometown, cannot be separated from Chairman Mao, cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought, and cannot be separated from the good policies and guidelines formulated by Chairman Mao. How can we not love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who have brought us such great changes? I often think that my parents were tortured to death by landlords when I, Kurban Tulum, was young, but when I was over sixty years old, I had parents again. These parents are Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In the past, when Uyghurs met, they would bless each other with Huda's (meaning God) blessing, but now I have changed this sentence to the Communist Party blesses you, Chairman Mao blesses you. It was precisely to express my love for the Party and Chairman Mao that I, Kurban Tulum, repeatedly wanted to ride a donkey to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. After being persuaded to come back, I lost my appetite. Later, I learned that the best workers could go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, and I suddenly became more motivated to work. Finally, at the age of seventy, I became a labor model and went to Beijing twice to see Chairman Mao. This year, Chairman Liu also received me in Hotan. After being liberated, I was determined to follow Chairman Mao to the end step by step. In 1959, I joined the Chinese Communist Party. This year, I started studying Chairman Mao's works, and I also sent more than 100 copies of Chairman Mao's books to the brigade's cultural center and various production teams, so that everyone can follow Chairman Mao to make revolution step by step.

    The Deng Tuo gang wants the Communist Party to step down and "rest," and wants us to move away from Chairman Mao step by step, so that the bayis can ride on the necks of us poor people again. This is really daydreaming. Let me tell you, the knife handle is in the hands of our working people, and we must overthrow all of you monsters and demons in this Cultural Revolution. The black books you write and the black talk you speak cannot cover up the light of the sun in the slightest. The more fiercely you scold, the more closely I, Kurban Tulum, and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will unite around the Party and Chairman Mao. We must better read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely follow Chairman Mao, and carry the revolution through to the end.

    That day, when I heard the Deng Tuo gang attacking the crimes of the Party, I rushed into the house in one breath and said these words to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, I, Kurban Tulum, will say it to you a thousand times and ten thousand times in the future: Dear Chairman Mao, we, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, will always love you and always follow you step by step!

    我们维吾尔人民永远跟着毛主席
　　新疆维吾尔自治区人民代表大会代表、自治区劳动模范　库尔班吐鲁木
    听说邓拓黑帮在北京一个劲地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，我顿时气得浑身打颤，血直往上涌。我一口气奔进屋里，把三面墙上贴的七张毛主席象，一张张摸着细细地看了一遍，对他老人家喃喃地说了几句话，心里这才稍稍舒坦了些。那以后，一连好多天一个念头始终在我脑子里打转：不成！我要领着两个儿子上北京和黑帮们拼去！毛泽东思想是我们心中不落的红太阳，邓拓黑帮反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，就是想摘掉我们心中的红太阳，你们的胆子真不小！告诉你们，毛泽东思想已经在我库尔班吐鲁木的心里，在新疆各族人民的心里扎下了根。要摘走我们心里的这个红太阳，比登天还难。我今年已经八十多岁了，许多认识我的人都感到奇怪，怎么库尔班吐鲁木越老越硬朗了，年年都当劳动模范，连长胡子也剪掉了，其实一点也不奇怪，就因为我心里有个不落的红太阳啊！自从我两次去北京见毛主席回来，我的心一刻也没有离开过毛主席。白天，我为队里割苇草、剁苇草时想着毛主席，感到浑身有使不完的劲。有时干完活回家吃饭，抬头一见毛主席象，我就又跑出去干上一会，再回来吃饭。夜晚我也想念毛主席。就在一个多月前新公路刚修通的时候，我还梦见新公路上开来一辆小汽车，停在我家门前，我日夜想念的毛主席周身披着一团红光，向我走来，我欣喜若狂地迎上前去……。
    我库尔班吐鲁木一刻也不能离开毛主席。果园里的桃子、杏子、葡萄熟了，我总想把最好的留下，设法给毛主席送去。去年我特意种了好多甜瓜，准备送给毛主席，但是一直没有机会，把我急得什么似的。幸好刘主席、陈毅副总理来到和田，我才高高兴兴地托他们送去两个。八年前我第一次去见毛主席时戴的小布帽，虽然旧了，但我还经常戴着它。我那条装过送给毛主席的礼物的“呼尔郡”（背搭子），那件穿着去见毛主席的单夹袢，我都保存得好好的，还不时拿出来看一看。为什么我要在屋里贴七张毛主席象？因为这样我无论脸朝哪里都能看到他老人家。每天，我眼睛看着毛主席象，心里还要无数遍地高呼毛主席万岁！
    树有根，水有源。我库尔班吐鲁木对毛主席的热爱，不是凭空产生的。邓拓一伙反党分子喜欢谈历史，我就和你们谈谈历史吧。我库尔班吐鲁木在旧社会生活了六十多年，其中的四十多年是在巴依（财主）的牲口圈和地窝子里度过的，给巴依当上马石（地主骑马时踩踏的垫脚石），替巴依洗身子，坐巴依的私牢……。我库尔班吐鲁木什么样的屈辱没有受过啊！巴依家几天就宰一只羊，我想总能捞到点汤喝喝吧，不，他们还要泡上馍馍喂狗呢。那时，我们穷人连个正名儿也没有，我父亲的名字叫吐鲁木，意思是羊皮袋子，那并不是我父亲的本名，是巴依诬我父亲饭吃得多，给起的侮辱性外号！我给巴依干了四十多年活，到头来还落了个满身的债务。
    再看看库尔班吐鲁木现在的生活吧：住上了雪白的房子，吃上了白面和水果，还喝上了奶子，我还被选为新疆维吾尔自治区人民代表大会代表和自治区劳动模范。我家乡的变化也很大。过去，这里穷人有的连粗布衣服还穿不上，更不用说盖被子。现在人人穿上了细布和纱绸衣服，家家都有了被子。过去穷人连坎土镘也买不起，现在我们有了各种新式农具，还有了拖拉机。我的大儿子还当了拖拉机手。过去这里干旱缺水，穷人连吃水也要受巴依的剥削，如今大队修了新水渠，旱年也能保丰收。一九五七年前我们大队还要国家供应粮食，从一九五九年起，我们就有余粮卖给国家了。我们大队是和田县的一个普通的大队，全和田、全新疆哪个地方不和我们大队一样起了翻天覆地的变化！我库尔班吐鲁木和我家乡这样大的变化，有哪一项离得开毛主席，有哪一项离得开毛泽东思想，离得开毛主席制订的好方针、好政策。对于给我们带来这么大变化的毛主席、共产党，我们怎能不热爱？我常想，我库尔班吐鲁木在幼年时，父母就被地主折磨死，但是到了六十多岁上我却又有了父母，这父母就是毛主席和共产党。过去我们维吾尔人见面都要互相祝福胡大（真主的意思）保佑，现在我把这句话改成了共产党保佑，毛主席保佑。正是为了表示对党和毛主席的热爱，我库尔班吐鲁木当年才几次三番要骑上毛驴去北京见毛主席。被人劝回来后，弄得我茶饭不思。后来我得知劳动最好的人可以上北京见毛主席，浑身平添了劳动干劲。终于在七十多岁当上了劳动模范，两次到北京见了毛主席。今年刘主席又在和田接见了我。解放后翻了身，我就决心步步跟着毛主席走到底。一九五九年，我加入了中国共产党，今年我又开始学习毛主席著作，我还给大队文化室和各生产队送了一百多本毛主席的书，让大伙也步步跟着毛主席闹革命。
    邓拓黑帮却要共产党下台“休息”，要我们步步远离毛主席，好让巴依们重新骑到我们穷人的脖子上来，这真是大白天做梦。告诉你们，刀把子在我们劳动人民的手里，我们一定要在这场文化大革命中，把你们这些牛鬼蛇神统统打倒。你们写的黑书，讲的黑话，丝毫遮盖不了太阳的光芒，你们越骂得凶，我库尔班吐鲁木和新疆各族人民越要紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围，我们要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚决跟着毛主席，将革命进行到底。
    那天我听到邓拓黑帮攻击党的罪行，一口气奔进屋里对毛主席说的就是这些话。毛主席，我库尔班吐鲁木今后还要一千遍一万遍地对你说：亲爱的毛主席，我们新疆各族人民永远热爱你，永远步步跟着你！　　（新华社乌鲁木齐十八日电）（附图片）
