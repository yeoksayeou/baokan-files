    Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association (AJA) issued a press communiqué on June 2nd, signed by Secretary-General Djawoto, exposing that a person named Arifin Bey, who claims to be the "Secretary-General" of the Asian-African Journalists Association, is visiting certain countries in execution of the Indonesian right-wing's plot to sabotage the AJA.
    The communiqué emphasized that this Arifin Bey, who has no connection with the Asian-African Journalists Association, was once a broadcaster for the "Voice of America" and represents the reactionary right-wing fascist group in Indonesia. This group is responsible for various atrocities and the barbaric massacre of hundreds of thousands of patriotic nationalists, progressive democrats, and communists, and for the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of progressive people, including hundreds of journalists, in numerous prisons and concentration camps.
    The communiqué stated that this person, Arifin Bey, who was illegally "appointed" as the so-called Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association by the Indonesian right-wing military regime, is now representing and implementing the reactionary policies of this regime. This regime, due to its barbaric crimes and fascist acts, has been subjected to the angry and strong condemnation of all progressive people and journalists worldwide, and has been condemned by many international and national conferences of Asian and African peoples, including the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the AJA Secretariat held in April this year with the participation of nineteen Asian and African countries.
    The communiqué stated that this Arifin Bey is one of the reactionary figures in the Indonesian right-wing journalists association. He serves the reactionary regime of Indonesia, and therefore, cannot be considered to have any connection with the Asian-African Journalists Association, a fighting organization of Asian and African journalists that upholds the anti-imperialist banner, guided by the 1963 Jakarta Declaration.
    The communiqué reiterated that it is the duty of all progressive Asian and African journalists to strongly express solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of people and journalists who have been killed and imprisoned in Indonesia.
    The communiqué further emphasized that the purpose of Arifin Bey's visit is to undermine the rock-solid anti-imperialist front of Asian and African journalists centered on the AJA Secretariat. After the AJA Secretariat was forced to evacuate Jakarta, it is currently working in Beijing, as unanimously agreed by the participants of the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the AJA Secretariat.
    The communiqué calls on all progressive journalists, organizations, and people who value Asian-African solidarity and resolutely oppose imperialism to expose the truth and conspiracy of the "visits" of Arifin Bey and his ilk, who serve the Indonesian right-wing military regime. Their sole purpose is to undermine the AJA and the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples.

    亚非记协书记处谴责印尼反动分子的招摇撞骗
    印尼右派破坏不了亚非记协反帝斗争
    新华社二日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处二日发表由总书记查禾多签署的新闻公报，揭露一个自称为亚非新闻工作者协会“总书记”的、名叫阿里芬·贝的人访问某些国家，是在执行印度尼西亚右派破坏亚非记协的阴谋。
    公报强调指出，这个同亚非新闻工作者协会毫无关系的名叫阿里芬·贝的人，曾经是“美国之音”的广播员，代表印度尼西亚反动的右派法西斯集团，这个集团对各种暴行和数十万爱国的民族主义者、进步的民主人士和共产党人横遭野蛮屠杀负有责任，对几十万进步人民、包括几百名新闻工作者被监禁在许多监狱和集中营负有责任。
    公报说，这个被印度尼西亚右派军事政权非法地“任命”为所谓亚非新闻工作者协会总书记的人现在正代表着并且在执行这个政权的反动政策。这个政权由于它的野蛮罪行和法西斯行径，受到了全世界所有进步人士和新闻工作者的愤怒的和强烈的谴责，受到了亚非人民的许多国际会议和全国性会议的谴责，其中包括今年四月召开的有十九个亚非国家参加的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体（扩大）会议。
    公报说，这个阿里芬·贝是印度尼西亚右派新闻工作者协会的反动人物之一，他是为印度尼西亚的反动政权服务的，因此，不能认为他同亚非新闻工作者协会，这个以一九六三年雅加达宣言为指导原则，高举反帝旗帜的亚非新闻工作者的战斗组织有任何关系。
    公报重申，向印度尼西亚几十万被杀害和监禁的人民和新闻工作者强烈表示声援，是所有亚非进步新闻工作者的义务。
    公报还进一步强调，阿里芬·贝访问的目的，是破坏以亚非新闻工作者协会书记处为核心的亚非新闻工作者坚如磐石的反帝阵线，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处被迫撤离雅加达以后，根据亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体（扩大）会议与会者一致同意，目前正在北京进行工作。
    公报要求所有以亚非团结为重、坚决反帝的进步新闻工作者、团体和人民，揭露为印度尼西亚右派军事政权服务的阿里芬·贝之流的“访问”的真相和阴谋，他们唯一的目的是破坏亚非新闻工作者协会和亚非人民的反帝斗争。
