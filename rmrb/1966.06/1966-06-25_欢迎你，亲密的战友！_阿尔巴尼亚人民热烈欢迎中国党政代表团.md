    Welcome, Dear Comrades-in-Arms!
    -- The Albanian People Warmly Welcome the Chinese Party and Government Delegation

    The friendly visit to Albania by the Chinese Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, has become a major event in the lives of the Albanian people. The Albanian people welcomed the envoys of the great Chinese people, Comrade Zhou Enlai, the close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, with boundless enthusiasm and sublime feelings.

    Today, Tirana, the capital of Albania, is decorated in a riot of colors, appearing exceptionally beautiful. The entire city is filled with an atmosphere of joy and friendship. At the airport, along the roads leading to the city center, and throughout the entire city, countless Chinese and Albanian national flags flutter in the wind, red flags waving. Numerous huge banners hang across tall buildings and streets. Workers, farmers, intellectuals, students, and cadres of the capital, filled with joy, flocked from all directions to the airport, to the roads along which the delegation would pass, and to the main thoroughfares of the city early in the morning.

    When Comrade Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Comrades Hoxha and Shehu, entered the city center in an open-top car, the welcoming crowds, dressed in festive attire, waved bouquets and Chinese and Albanian national flags, and held portraits of the leaders of both countries, holding a warm welcome. People cheered the great unity and fighting friendship of the Chinese and Albanian parties, countries, and peoples with unbridled enthusiasm. Slogans such as "Enver Hoxha – Mao Zedong," "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" "Imperialism and Revisionism are Bound to Fail!" resounded through the sky, and revolutionary songs echoed throughout the city. Colorful welcoming leaflets, scattered from high buildings by the people, floated across the city like a rain of colors from the azure sky. The Albanian people expressed the great friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples on these leaflets. These leaflets demonstrated the determination of the Chinese and Albanian peoples to share weal and woe, resolutely defend Marxism-Leninism, and carry the great struggle against imperialism and against revisionism to the end, and poured out the Albanian people's boundless love for the Chinese people and their great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

    In Skanderbeg Square in the city center, the climax of welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests appeared. There, tens of thousands of people packed the large and wide square, making it watertight. A thousand artists performed large-scale dances such as "Holding a Pick in One Hand and a Gun in the Other" and excerpts from the Chinese drama "The South China Sea Great Wall" for the distinguished Chinese guests. Acrobatic troupe actors performed wonderful Chinese acrobatics. Three hundred choir members, accompanied by a hundred-member orchestra, sang loudly "Beijing – Tirana" and songs praising Chairman Mao Zedong. Fifteen hundred athletes wearing various colored sportswear performed various graceful gymnastics performances in the center of the square. In the center of the square, athletes used graceful movements to form various flower patterns on tall iron tower frames. Two athletes held high the Chinese and Albanian national flags at the top of the tower frame, symbolizing the fighting unity of China and Albania.

    In the square, the capital's militia, embodying the Albanian people's revolutionary fighting spirit of "holding a pick in one hand and a gun in the other," stood in neat rows, shouting majestic slogans, paying tribute to Comrade Zhou Enlai and other distinguished Chinese guests.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai waved frequently to the artists, singers, athletes, and militiamen, thanking them for their wonderful performances full of fighting spirit, unity, and friendship.

    Among the welcoming crowds were the ranks of workers from various factories and enterprises in Tirana. They were determined to greet Comrade Zhou Enlai and other distinguished Chinese guests with greater production achievements. Wan Jiangge, a worker at the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory who had studied in China in 1964, said: "The workers in our factory, like all the Albanian people, warmly welcome the arrival of Comrade Zhou Enlai with incomparable joy. Our factory was built with Chinese assistance, and it is a crystallization of Sino-Albanian friendship. We are determined to greet the distinguished Chinese guests with greater production achievements."

    All members of the Mezhez Agricultural Cooperative, who are celebrating this year's summer harvest, participated in the welcoming procession in the suburbs today, welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests like welcoming relatives. A few days ago, when the news of Comrade Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit was announced, the cooperative immediately held party organization and member meetings to discuss how to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. They worked overnight to make flags, banners, and practice songs and dances, and also launched a labor competition to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. Bu Solaru, a female member of the cooperative, a candidate for the People's Assembly, and a member of the Youth League, said, "Today is the happiest day for me. Comrade Zhou Enlai is visiting our country for the third time, and I sincerely welcome him. I am determined to exceed the production tasks with greater labor enthusiasm to celebrate his arrival." Dai Lusi, a milker at the agricultural cooperative named "New China," led her two children to wait by the road at five o'clock in the morning to welcome the Chinese relatives. She said: "Today is the third time I have come to welcome Premier Zhou. I hope he comes often. If he comes a thousand times, I will welcome him a thousand times. I came so early to welcome him because I love Mao Zedong. I wish Mao Zedong a long life like the Albanian mountains, to bring happiness to the Chinese people and to the people of the world."

    In the welcoming ranks, there were tens of thousands of Young Pioneers from the capital. They waved bouquets and red flags naively, welcoming Grandpa Zhou's arrival. The Young Pioneers of the Hassan Vogili Eight-Year School held the flowers they had carefully planted and cultivated themselves. They said: "We offer these flowers and our hearts to Grandpa Zhou." Osmani, the squadron leader of the "Sino-Albanian Friendship Class" of this school and an outstanding student, said: "I welcome Grandpa Zhou with a fiery heart. Grandpa Zhou's visit will not only enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples, but also enhance the friendship between the Young Pioneers of the two countries. We are determined to use better academic achievements to celebrate his visit."

    Among the student ranks who warmly welcomed Comrade Zhou Enlai, Emili, a student in the History Department of Tirana University, said: "Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Albania is a great encouragement to our people, and it also has a great promotion effect on my further study of Mao Zedong's works. I have already read articles such as 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains,' and 'Serve the People.' I want to study more of Mao Zedong's works. Our school is currently holding semester exams. In order to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's arrival, I want to strive for excellent results."

    The famous Albanian writer She Musalei said: "Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit to Albania is a huge event that is difficult to describe in words and fills my heart with joy. Because I have deep respect and love for the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and its great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. The inspiring words Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke to us at the Writers Club during his visit to Albania in 1964 still resonate in our minds. We welcome his arrival with deep friendship, and we will enrich our creations with revolutionary spirit and content."

    Today, in the welcoming ranks, there were also commanders and fighters of the Albanian People's Army wearing brand-new military uniforms. They warmly welcomed Comrade Zhou Enlai with feelings of respect and love for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Ku Husena, a soldier and sharpshooter of the Albanian People's Army who has won the title of "Five-Good Soldier" for three consecutive years, said: "I, like the people of the whole country and all the soldiers, warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. In the name of a soldier, I extend a fighting salute to the distinguished Chinese guests!" He also said: "The armies of Albania and China have a traditional revolutionary friendship, and we will always fight side by side with the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

    Not long ago, the visit to China by the Albanian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Shehu and the "Sino-Albanian Joint Statement" signed by both sides promoted the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples to a new stage. Now, Comrade Zhou Enlai himself has led the Chinese Party and Government Delegation for the third time after his two visits in 1964 and 1965, and his friendly visit here will surely push the great friendship and fighting unity between the Chinese and Albanian parties, countries, and peoples to a new peak.

### 欢迎你，亲密的战友！——阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢迎中国党政代表团

    欢迎你，亲密的战友！
    ——阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢迎中国党政代表团
    由中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团，到达阿尔巴尼亚进行的友好访问，成为阿尔巴尼亚人民生活中的一件大事。阿尔巴尼亚人民以无限热情和崇高的感情，来欢迎伟大中国人民的使者，毛泽东同志的亲密战友周恩来同志。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民首都地拉那打扮得五彩缤纷，显得分外美丽。全城充满了欢乐和友谊的气氛。在机场上，在通往市区的公路两旁，在整个市区，无数面中阿两国国旗迎风飘扬，红旗招展。在高大的建筑物上和街道上横挂着无数面巨幅标语。首都的工人、农民、知识分子、学生、干部怀着喜悦的心情，一清早就从四面八方涌向机场，涌向代表团路经的公路和城市的通衢大道。
    当周恩来同志在霍查同志和谢胡同志陪同下乘敞篷汽车进入市区时，穿着节日服装的欢迎群众，挥舞着花束和中阿两国国旗，举着中阿两国领导人的画象，举行热烈欢迎。人们以奔放的热情欢呼中阿两党、两国和两国人民的伟大团结和战斗友谊。“恩维尔·霍查—毛泽东”、“阿中友谊万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“帝国主义和修正主义必败”等口号声震天动地，革命歌声响彻全城。人们从高楼上撒下的五颜六色的欢迎传单，有如彩雨一般从碧空中飘向全城。阿尔巴尼亚人民在这些传单上表达了中阿两国人民的伟大友谊。这些传单表明了中阿两国人民同甘共苦，坚决保卫马克思列宁主义，把反对帝国主义和反对修正主义的伟大斗争进行到底的决心，倾注了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的无限热爱。
    在市中心斯坎德培广场，出现了欢迎中国贵宾的最高潮。在那里，成千上万的人群把宽大、广阔的广场挤得水泄不通。一千名文艺工作者向中国贵宾演出了“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”等大型舞蹈和中国的话剧《南海长城》中的片段。杂技团的演员们表演了精采的中国杂技。三百名合唱队员在一百人组成的乐队伴奏下，高声歌唱“北京—地拉那”和歌颂毛泽东主席的歌曲。穿着各种颜色运动服的一千五百名体育大军，在广场中心进行了各种姿态优美的体操表演。在广场中心，运动员们在高大的铁制塔架上用优美的动作组成各式各样的花朵图案。两名运动员在塔架的尖顶高举中阿两国国旗，象征着中阿两国的战斗团结。
    广场里，体现阿尔巴尼亚人民“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的革命战斗精神的首都民兵，排着整齐的队伍，呼着雄壮的口号，向周恩来同志和其他中国贵宾致敬。
    周恩来同志向艺术家、歌唱家、运动员、民兵们频频招手，感谢他们的充满战斗、团结和友谊精神的精采表演。
    在欢迎的人群中有着地拉那各工厂企业的职工队伍。他们决心以更大的生产成绩迎接周恩来同志和其他中国贵宾。曾在一九六四年到中国学习过的地拉那拖拉机配件工厂的工人万·江哥说：“我们厂的工人同全体阿尔巴尼亚人民一样，以无比高兴的心情热烈欢迎周恩来同志的到来。我们的工厂是由中国帮助建设的，它是阿中友好的结晶。我们决心以更大的生产成绩，来迎接中国贵宾。”
    正在欢庆今年夏季丰收的梅泽兹农业合作社全体社员今天都参加到郊区的欢迎行列，他们象迎接亲人似的欢迎中国贵宾。几天前，当周恩来同志即将来访的消息公布以后，这个合作社立即召开党组织和社员大会，讨论如何迎接中国贵宾。他们彻夜赶制旗帜、标语和练习歌舞，还为迎接中国贵宾展开了劳动竞赛。合作社的女社员、人民议会代表候选人、青年联盟盟员布·索拉露说，“今天是我最高兴的日子了。周恩来同志第三次到我国来访问，我衷心地欢迎他。我决心以更大的劳动热情超额完成生产任务来祝贺他的到来。”以“新中国”命名的农业合作社挤奶员戴·卢西为了迎接中国亲人，早晨五点钟就领着她的两个孩子，来到公路旁等待。她说：“今天我是第三次来欢迎周总理，我希望他常来，他来一千次，我就欢迎他一千次。我这样早来欢迎他是因为我热爱毛泽东，我祝愿毛泽东象阿尔巴尼亚高山一样长寿，为中国人民，为全世界人民谋幸福。”
    在欢迎的队伍里，有成千上万的首都少先队员。他们天真地挥舞着花束、红旗，迎接周伯伯的到来。哈桑·沃格利八年制学校的少先队员们拿着他们自己精心栽种和培育的鲜花。他们说：“我们把这些鲜花和我们的心一起献给周伯伯。”这个学校的“阿中友好班”少先队中队长、优秀学生奥斯马尼说：“我用一颗火热的心，迎接周伯伯。周伯伯的访问不仅将增进阿中两国人民的友谊，也将增进两国少先队员的友谊。我们决心用更好的学习成绩来祝贺他的访问。”
    在热情欢迎周恩来同志的学生队伍中，地拉那大学历史系学生埃米利说：“周恩来总理到阿尔巴尼亚访问是对我国人民的巨大鼓舞，对我进一步学习毛泽东著作也有很大的推动作用。我已经读过《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》这些文章，我还要学习更多的毛泽东著作。现在我们学校正在举行学期考试，为了欢迎周恩来总理的到来，我要争取得到优秀成绩。”
    阿尔巴尼亚著名作家谢·穆萨莱说：“周恩来同志访问阿尔巴尼亚是一件巨大的、难以用笔墨形容的、使我内心充满喜悦的重大事件。因为我对中国人民、中国共产党和它的伟大领袖毛泽东同志深怀敬爱之情。周恩来同志一九六四年访问阿尔巴尼亚时，在作家俱乐部对我们讲的鼓舞人心的话，现在仍然在我们脑际回响。我们以深厚的友情欢迎他的到来，我们将以革命精神和内容来丰富我们的创作。”
    今天在欢迎的队伍中，还有穿着崭新军服的阿尔巴尼亚人民军的指战员。他们怀着对中国人民、中国人民解放军尊敬和热爱的感情，热情地欢迎周恩来同志。曾经接连三年获得“五好战士”称号的阿尔巴尼亚人民军战士、神枪手库·胡塞纳说：“我同全国人民和所有战士一样，热烈欢迎周恩来总理，我以战士的名义向中国贵宾致以战斗的敬礼！”他又说：“阿中两国军队有着传统的革命友谊，我们将永远与中国人民解放军并肩战斗。”
    不久以前，以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国和双方签署的“中阿联合声明”，把中阿两国人民的友谊推进到了一个新的阶段。现在，周恩来同志又亲自率领中国党政代表团，继一九六四年和一九六五年两次访问之后，第三次到这里进行友好访问，必将把中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的伟大友谊和战斗团结推向新的高峰。　新华社记者（附图片）
