    Overthrow the Bourgeois Academic Authorities' Rule
    Cui Min, Zhang Wenqing, Chen Xinxiu, Gao Deyuan, Graduates of Peking University
    During our five years of study at Peking University, no one, and no course, systematically taught the works of Chairman Mao. The gang members used bourgeois reactionary viewpoints to resist Mao Zedong Thought, peddled bourgeois and revisionist private goods, sang a tune contrary to the Party's educational policy, and contended with the Party for the younger generation.
    We are graduates of the Law Department of Peking University, and today we specially bring this big-character poster to our alma mater to support the socialist cultural revolution at Peking University and to denounce the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the "Three-Family Village" gang.
    For a long time, under the control of the "Three-Family Village" gang members Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, Peking University has become an independent kingdom monopolized and ruled by bourgeois academic authorities. They have turned Peking University into a base for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, wantonly spreading feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist poisons, desperately resisting Mao Zedong Thought, resisting the Party's educational policy, and contending with the Party for the younger generation, vainly attempting to drag young students over to become gravediggers for the landlords and bourgeoisie.
    The Party and Chairman Mao teach us that the task of institutions of higher learning is to propagate and study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to arm the students' minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. But what has Peking University done? Whether it is the university Party committee, or the various departments and so many teaching and research sections, who has organized, led, or helped students to earnestly study the works of Chairman Mao? No one has. During our five years of study at Peking University, no one, and no course, systematically and comprehensively taught the works of Chairman Mao. What did we learn? "Soviet Civil Law," "Soviet Criminal Law," "Criminal Procedure Law," "Bourgeois State Law," "History of Foreign States and Law," "History of Chinese States and Law," and so on, truly a dazzling array, but there was no systematic teaching of the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, no systematic teaching of Chairman Mao's expositions on class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and no systematic teaching of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's formulated policies and guidelines for eliminating counterrevolutionaries in our country. Law is the most concentrated expression of the will of the ruling class. In principle, the law department of a socialist university must use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, take the works of Chairman Mao as the basic and primary teaching material, and guide students to honestly and faithfully read Chairman Mao's books, focusing on solving the problem of world outlook. However, the reality is not so. Some professors enthusiastically lectured on Laski's theories and the American "separation of powers." Some professors relished in promoting that "citizens' ownership should be protected by law." Some people tirelessly narrated the changes of dynasties in Chinese history. Others tasted a thick book written by a professor at Moscow University and how much royalties he got. Some people often openly bragged about how profound their knowledge was, and so on. Have you talked about Chairman Mao's works? Can you talk about Chairman Mao's works? The teaching materials used were Soviet textbooks or "lecture notes" by bourgeois "authorities" and "professors." As for Chairman Mao's works? In their view, it was not "logical" and lacked "systematicness," and could only be used as a "reference book." To teach philosophy, one had to start from Aristotle of ancient Greece and end up with the so-called "three major laws" and "seven categories," while Mao Zedong's brilliant works such as "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" were only mentioned in passing, as references only. They quoted a few paragraphs from Chairman Mao only to decorate the facade, embellish it, taking phrases out of context, piecing things together, "taking what they needed," forcing the shoe to fit the foot, and letting Chairman Mao's works serve them. This is how they blatantly used bourgeois reactionary viewpoints to resist Mao Zedong Thought. This is the despicable method of these bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, using the guise of teaching Chairman Mao's works to peddle bourgeois and revisionist private goods.
    Those bourgeois academic authorities, putting on the faces of teachers, adopted the "cramming" method, stubbornly instilling their set of bourgeois reactionary ideas into the minds of the younger generation. Students took notes in class, copied notes after class, memorized notes for exams, and burned notes after the exams. But what use are these things after all? We have graduated for several years, and have never seen anyone use "Soviet Criminal and Civil Law" to judge a case, and have never learned the wonderful use of Laski's theory. As for becoming famous and successful, those who have been poisoned by this will end up being battered and bloodied. You talk about this law and that law, but you just don't talk about Mao Zedong Thought, you just don't talk about Chairman Mao's theory on class, class struggle, and the people's democratic dictatorship. Aren't your bourgeois teaching line, teaching ideas, and teaching methods openly resisting Mao Zedong Thought and singing a tune contrary to the Party's educational policy?
    We have graduated and left school for several years. Has Peking University made progress and become better in these years? No! The fact is that in these years, due to the control of the "Three-Family Village" gang members Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and others, the bourgeois rule has become increasingly serious. Some of our classmates stayed on at the school as graduate students, supposedly to study "the history of the Chinese legal system." We have never heard of any agency or department needing this "knowledge." May we ask Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk: Why do you want to guide good young people to delve into the pile of old papers? What kind of "talent" are you training by running schools, and which class do you serve?
    After the start of the Cultural Revolution, under the instruction of your backstage boss, the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, you tried to reverse the direction of this great revolution, guiding it from a sharp class struggle to a discussion of purely academic issues. Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk personally planned and organized dozens of comrades in the Law Department to search through all the historical materials of the Ming Dynasty to study how many unjust cases Hai Rui had redressed for the peasants! You not only promoted this so-called "good experience" at Peking University, but also sent people to the "Qing officials" problem discussion meeting held by the Institute of Law to promote this black merchandise. By doing so, you are blatantly resisting this Cultural Revolution.
    The above facts show that Peking University, under the control of the "Three-Family Village" gang, has long been completely turned into a stubborn bastion of revisionism, becoming a position for them to poison young people and compete with the proletariat for the younger generation.
    Peking University is a school with a glorious revolutionary tradition, and now it has become an anti-Party and anti-socialist tool monopolized and ruled by bourgeois academic authorities, tarnishing the reputation of Peking University. Now the Cultural Revolution is developing vigorously throughout the country with an unstoppable force, sweeping away all monsters and demons and washing away all bourgeois dirt and pollution. At Peking University, the prelude to the struggle has also begun, which is a great thing. We are delighted to learn that the new Municipal Party Committee has decided to remove Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun from all their posts, and the work team has entered Peking University. We warmly support the decisions of the Central Committee and the new Municipal Party Committee. Although we have graduated and left school, we are determined to fight alongside the comrades of Peking University, thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop and all its branches, overthrow the rule of the bourgeois academic authorities, and fight for the construction of a new socialist Peking University! Let us closely unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, pursue the victory, and beat those bourgeois "experts," "professors," and "authorities" to the point where they are in a sorry state and completely discredited, so that Mao Zedong Thought can take root, blossom, and bear fruit at Peking University. We firmly believe that the proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University will surely win a complete victory!

    打倒资产阶级学阀统治
    北京大学毕业生　崔敏　张文清　陈新秀　高德原
    我们在北大学习五年，从来没有一个人，也没有一门课系统地讲授过毛主席著作。黑帮分子用资产阶级反动观点来对抗毛泽东思想，贩卖资产阶级、修正主义私货，同党的教育方针唱反调，同党争夺青年一代
    我们是北大法律系的毕业生，今天特为母校送来这张大字报，声援北大的社会主义文化大革命，声讨“三家村”黑帮分子的反党反社会主义罪行。
    长期以来，北京大学在“三家村”黑帮分子陆平、彭珮云的把持下，成为资产阶级学阀垄断、统治的独立王国。他们把北大作为反党反社会主义的大本营，放肆地散布封建主义、资产阶级和修正主义的毒素，拼命抵制毛泽东思想，对抗党的教育方针，同党争夺青年一代，妄图把青年学生拉过去做地主、资产阶级的殉墓人。
    党和毛主席教导我们：高等学校的任务就是宣传、学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，用马列主义、毛泽东思想武装学生的头脑，培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。而北大是怎样做的呢？无论是校党委，还是各系和那么多的教研室，有谁来组织、领导、帮助学生认真地学习过毛主席著作吗？没有。我们在北大学习五年，从来没有一个人，也没有一门课系统地、全面地讲授过毛主席著作。我们学了些什么呢？“苏维埃民法”、“苏维埃刑法”、“刑事诉讼法”、“资产阶级国家法”、“外国国家与法的历史”、“中国国家与法的历史”等等，真可谓名目繁多，五花八门，然而就是没有系统地讲过《毛泽东选集》，没有系统地讲过毛主席关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的论述，没有系统地讲过党中央和毛主席制定的我国肃反路线、方针、政策。法律是统治阶级意志最集中的表现，按理来说，社会主义大学的法律系必须用毛泽东思想来统帅一切，把毛主席著作当做基本的、主要的教材，引导学生老老实实地，原原本本地读毛主席的书，着重解决世界观的问题，然而事实却不然。有的教授在课堂上兴致勃勃地大讲英国的拉斯基学说和美国的“三权分立”。有的教授津津有味地宣扬什么“公民的所有权应当受到法律保护”。有的人不厌其烦地叙述中国历代王朝的更迭。还有人品味莫斯科大学某教授写了厚厚的一本书，得了多少稿费。有人则是经常公开吹嘘自己学问如何渊博，等等。你们讲过毛主席著作吗？你们能讲毛主席著作吗？教材，用的是苏联教科书，或者是什么资产阶级“权威”、“教授”的“讲义”。而毛主席著作呢？在他们看来，那是不合“逻辑”、缺乏“系统性”的，只能作为“参考书”。讲哲学要从古希腊的亚里斯多德开始，落脚到什么“三大规律”、“七个范畴”，而对毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，只是附带几句，参考参考而已。他们引几段毛主席的话，不过是为了装潢门面，点缀一番，断章取义，东拼西凑，“各取所需”，削足塞履，让毛主席著作为他们服务。他们就是这样明目张胆地用资产阶级的反动观点来对抗毛泽东思想，这就是这些资产阶级“学者”“权威”打着红旗反红旗，打着讲毛主席著作的幌子，贩卖资产阶级、修正主义私货的卑鄙手法。
    那些资产阶级的学阀们，板起一副教师爷的面孔，采取“填鸭式”办法，硬把他们那一套资产阶级反动思想，灌输进年青一代的心灵。学生在课堂上记笔记，课后抄笔记，考试背笔记，考完烧笔记。而这些东西究竟有什么用呢？我们毕业几年了，未曾见用什么“苏维埃刑民法”断一案者，更未领教过拉斯基学说的妙用。至于成名成家嘛，凡是中了此毒的，到头来被碰得头破血流。你们讲这法，讲那法，就是不讲毛泽东思想，就是不讲毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争和人民民主专政的学说。你们的这种资产阶级教学路线、教学思想、教学方法，不是公开对抗毛泽东思想、同党的教育方针唱反调吗？
    我们毕业离校几年了，是否这几年北大进步了，变好了呢？没有！事实是，这几年来，由于“三家村”黑帮分子陆平、彭珮云等人的控制，资产阶级统治日甚一日。我们的同学有的毕业后留校做研究生，据说是研究“中国法制史”。我们没有听说过那个机关、那个部门需要这门“学问”。请问陆平、彭珮云之流：你们为什么要把好好的青年引导去钻故纸堆呢？你们办学校究竟是要培养什么“人才”，为那个阶级服务呢？
    文化大革命开始以后，你们在后台老板前北京市委的指使下，力图扭转这场大革命的方向，把它从一场尖锐的阶级斗争引导到纯学术问题的讨论上。陆平、彭珮云之流，亲自策划、组织法律系几十个同志，遍查全部明史资料，来研究什么海瑞究竟为农民平了几个冤狱！你们不但在北大推广这种所谓的“好经验”，而且派人到法学研究所举办的“清官”问题讨论会上推销这种黑货。你们这样做，就是明目张胆地对抗这场文化大革命。
    以上事实说明，北大在“三家村”黑帮分子的控制下，早已完全变成了修正主义的顽固堡垒，成为他们毒害青年，同无产阶级争夺青年一代的阵地。
    北大是一个具有光荣革命传统的学校，现在变成了资产阶级学阀垄断、统治的反党反社会主义工具，污辱了北大的校誉。现在文化大革命正在全国轰轰烈烈开展，其势不可挡，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，荡涤着一切资产阶级的泥垢污染。在北大，斗争的序幕也已经揭开，这是一件天大的好事。我们欣闻新市委已决定撤销陆平、彭珮云一切职务，工作组已进驻北大，我们热烈拥护中央和新市委的决定。虽然我们已毕业离校，但我们决心同北大的同志们一道，共同战斗，彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店和它的一切分店，打倒资产阶级学阀的统治，为建设社会主义新北大而战斗！让我们紧密团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜追击，把那些资产阶级的“专家”、“教授”，“权威”打他个落花流水，威风扫地，使毛泽东思想在北大生根、开花、结果。我们坚信，北大的无产阶级革命派一定能够取得彻底的胜利！
