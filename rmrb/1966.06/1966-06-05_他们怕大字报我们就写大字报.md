    From the big-character poster of Nie Yuanzi and six other comrades from Peking University, we have seen the reactionary crimes of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun, which fills us with righteous indignation. We want to warn the "Three-Family Village" black gang elements Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun, your attempt to maintain the stubborn anti-Party and anti-socialist stronghold and resist stubbornly is a pipe dream! The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will absolutely not spare you! We will thoroughly expose your conspiracies and tricks, smash your stubborn fortress with hammers, and completely eliminate this gang of black gangsters!
    After the articles by Gao Ju and He Ming were published, a high tide of denouncing the "Three-Family Village" was set off across the country. But you do not allow the masses to criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang politically, do not allow meetings to be held, and do not allow big-character posters to be written. Why is this? It is not difficult to see that you are afraid of big-character posters, afraid of holding meetings to denounce your accomplices, and afraid of the masses rising up to bring down the "bosses" of this gang of black gangsters. Let us tell you, we will hold meetings and write big-character posters to thoroughly expose you black gang and expose your ugly faces in broad daylight! Your attempt to stick to the anti-Party and anti-socialist stronghold and resist the revolutionary people to the end is absolutely impossible!
    We want to solemnly warn Deng Tuo, Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and all the big and small demons and monsters, your doomsday has arrived, quickly raise your black hands and thoroughly confess your reactionary crimes to the people. Otherwise, none of you will escape!

    他们怕大字报我们就写大字报
    我们从北京大学聂元梓等七同志的大字报中，看到了宋硕、陆平、彭珮云的反动罪行，无不义愤填膺。我们要警告宋硕、陆平、彭珮云“三家村”黑帮分子，你们企图保持反党反社会主义的顽固堡垒，负隅顽抗，这是白日做梦！用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民绝对饶不了你们！我们要彻底揭露你们的阴谋诡计，用铁锤砸烂你们的顽固堡垒，彻底消灭你们这群黑帮！
    当高炬、何明的文章发表以后，全国掀起了声讨“三家村”的高潮。而你们不让群众从政治上进行批判反党反社会主义的黑帮，不让开大会，写大字报，这是为什么？不难看出，你们害怕大字报，害怕开大会声讨你们的同伙，害怕群众起来搞垮你们这群黑帮的“老板”。告诉你们，我们就是要开大会，写大字报，彻底揭露你们这伙黑帮，把你们的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下！你们要坚守反党反社会主义的堡垒，跟革命的人民顽抗到底，这绝对办不到！
    我们要正告邓拓、宋硕、陆平、彭珮云和一切大大小小的牛鬼蛇神，你们的末日到了，赶快举起你们的黑手，向人民彻底交代你们的反动罪行。不然，你们一个也别想逃掉！
