    Record of Atrocities of Indonesian Armed Forces Colluding with Right-Wing Thugs to Attack and Destroy Chinese Representative Offices

    Since October 1965, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have stirred up an anti-China wave, taking a series of fascist violent actions against Chinese representative offices in Indonesia. All these anti-China atrocities were carried out under the leadership and cooperation of Indonesian military police. Obviously, this is a planned action taken by the Indonesian government in order to completely break off diplomatic relations between the two countries. The main events of these anti-China fascist atrocities committed by the Indonesian armed forces in collusion with right-wing thugs in the past eight months are listed as follows:

    1965
    October 16 A unit of more than 40 Indonesian armed forces personnel, armed with guns, illegally broke into the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, searched the offices and dormitories, and forcibly searched and insulted Chinese diplomatic officials. The officer in charge of this armed force claimed that they were sent by the Jakarta Military Region Command and were executing orders from the government.

    October 21 One Indonesian army soldier, armed with a machine gun, accompanied by two men in plain clothes, illegally invaded the Chinese Embassy dormitory at 72 Chatti Petambulan Road, Jakarta, and forcibly conducted an inspection. Subsequently, an Indonesian armed forces patrol jeep once broke into the courtyard of the dormitory.

    November 2 A group of Indonesian right-wing thugs, under the instigation and support of the local military and political authorities, held an anti-China demonstration in front of the Chinese Consulate in Medan, smashed the doors and windows of the consulate with stones, rushed into the consulate, forcibly took away the Chinese national flag and national emblem hanging in the consulate, and shouted slogans insulting Chinese national leaders. When the thugs attacked, a large number of Indonesian military police on the scene stood by and did not stop them. According to Indonesian newspapers in Medan, Anwar Batang, Secretary of the North Sumatra Provincial Government, and Governor Tenuum Banu, representative of the provincial governor, had met with the thugs in advance and "expressed their gratitude for their attitude." Colonel Nanlan, representative of the Second Military Region Commander, met with them afterwards and expressed sympathy and admiration for their actions.

    December 10 Indonesian right-wing thugs held an anti-China rally at the Medan Stadium. The Acting Governor of North Sumatra and the Chief of Staff of the Second Military Region both spoke at the rally. After the meeting, the thugs attacked the Chinese Consulate in Medan again, injuring three staff members of the consulate.

    1966
    February 3 More than 1,000 right-wing thugs, with the connivance of the Indonesian government, launched a rampant attack on the Chinese Embassy. They openly smashed the Chinese national emblem hanging on the gate of the embassy, ​​seized the copper plaque bearing the mark of the "Embassy of the People's Republic of China," and injured a staff member of the embassy. Dozens of Indonesian military police present not only stood by and did not stop them, but also waved to the thugs to signal and encourage them. During this period, the Chinese Embassy had repeatedly notified relevant departments such as the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Police, and the Mobile Police Command by telephone, requesting them to immediately take effective measures to protect the safety of the embassy. However, they never took active measures.

    February 10 Several hundred right-wing thugs launched a rampant attack on the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin.

    February 23 Thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing forces attacked the Chinese Consulate in Ujung Pandang.

    February 25 After a mass meeting of loyalty to President Sukarno was held under the auspices of the Governor of South Sulawesi Province, a group of more than 300 right-wing thugs shouted slogans such as "Long Live Nasution," and then attacked and destroyed the Chinese Consulate in Ujung Pandang. Chinese Consul Shi Jinkan and other staff members of the consulate were beaten and injured. The military police on the scene stood by and allowed the thugs to commit violence. Afterwards, they also prevented the Chinese Consulate from taking down the Indonesian national flag raised by the thugs on the consulate's flagpole, saying that this was the order of the Ujung Pandang base commander.
    The thugs also painted the slogan "Long Live Nasution" on the walls of the consulate.

    March 9 Several hundred thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces frantically attacked and destroyed the Jakarta branch of the Xinhua News Agency, barbarously injuring Xinhua branch reporters Zhang Haitao, Li Ruifeng, Tan Dongbai, and two staff members.

The thugs also forcibly kidnapped Wu Pengde and Li Huanquan, staff members of the Consulate General, to the Fifth Military Region Command of the Army for illegal interrogation. Afterwards, an Indonesian army lieutenant and two soldiers escorted them to the detention center. After Wu Pengde and Li Huanquan repeatedly questioned and protested, the Fifth Military Region Command sent an officer to escort them to the gate of the Chinese Embassy and released them.

    March 29 With the connivance of the Medan authorities, more than 1,000 thugs claiming to be the "Indonesian Youth and Student Unified Action Organization Arif Rahman Ampera Brigade" attacked the Chinese Consulate in Medan again. When the thugs committed the violence, the military police specially responsible for guarding the Chinese Consulate did not take any measures to stop them.

    April 15 Indonesian army troops, under the cover of armored vehicles, colluded with right-wing thugs, totaling more than 1,000 people, and frantically attacked the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. They injured five Chinese diplomatic officials, including First Secretary Lü Zibo and Deputy Military Attaché Shi Xinren, and even openly fired dozens of shots at the embassy personnel. Staff member Zhao Xiaoshou was shot in the chest and seriously injured. When they were leaving, they shouted slogans such as "Long Live America" ​​and "We have completed the task that Uncle Suharto told us to destroy the Chinese Embassy."

    April 19 About 300 Indonesian right-wing thugs, led by three police officers, destroyed and occupied the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta. They declared: "We are here to take over the Chinese Consulate General on the order of Uncle Amir, Commander of the Fifth Military Region. From today, this house is ours." On May 22, with the open support of the Jakarta Fifth Military Region Command, the office of the Chinese Consulate General was officially transferred to the "Indonesian University Student Unified Action Organization" as its "headquarters."

    May 4 More than 30 Indonesian right-wing thugs, in coordination with military police, destroyed and occupied the Chinese Consulate in Ujung Pandang, and hung up a large banner of "Kami Headquarters".

    May 7 With the support of the Indonesian Sumatra Defense Area Inter-Regional Command and the Second Military Region authorities, they openly instigated Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to coerce overseas Chinese to hold anti-China rallies and parades in Medan. They were "inspected" by Brigadier General Mosqueda, the Chief of Staff and representative of the Defense Area Inter-Regional Commander, at the Sumatra Defense Area Inter-Regional Command. And, once again, they frantically attacked the Chinese Consulate in Medan, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Uncle Suharto".

    May 28 More than 40 Indonesian right-wing thugs and Chiang Kai-shek elements, with the full assistance and cooperation of the armed military police in South Kalimantan, destroyed and occupied the Chinese Consulate in Banjarmasin. When the thugs handed over the Chinese Consulate to the Tenth Military Region Command for "takeover," Sabirin Mochtar, Commander of the Tenth Military Region, openly "expressed his respect" for their atrocities.

    印尼武装部队伙同右派暴徒袭击、破坏中国代表机构的暴行录
    自一九六五年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起了一股反华的逆流，对中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构采取了一系列的法西斯暴力行为。所有这些反华暴行都是在印度尼西亚军警的带领和配合下干出来的。显然，这是印度尼西亚政府为了完全破裂两国外交关系而采取的有计划的行动。现将八个月来，印度尼西亚武装部队伙同右派暴徒制造这类反华法西斯暴行的主要事件列举如下：
    一九六五年
    十月十六日　一支荷枪实弹的印度尼西亚武装部队四十余人，非法闯入中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆商务参赞处，大肆搜查办公室和宿舍，并且对中国外交官员强行人身搜查和侮辱。指挥这批武装部队的军官声称，他们是由雅加达军区司令部派来的，是奉政府命令来执行任务的。
    十月二十一日　印度尼西亚陆军士兵一人持机枪一挺，偕便衣二人，非法侵入雅加达的查蒂·佩坦布兰路七十二号中国大使馆宿舍强行进行检查。随后，又有印度尼西亚武装部队的一辆巡逻吉普车，一度闯入宿舍的院内。
    十一月二日　一批印度尼西亚右派暴徒在当地军政当局指使和支持下到棉兰中国领事馆前举行反华示威，用石头打碎了领事馆的门窗，冲入领事馆内，强行劫走在领事馆内悬挂的中国国旗和国徽，叫喊侮辱中国国家领导人的口号。当暴徒袭击时，在场的大批印度尼西亚军警，一直袖手旁观，不加制止。据棉兰的印度尼西亚报纸报道，北苏门答腊省政府秘书长安瓦尔·巴唐和省长代表、州长特努姆·巴努，在事前曾接见这批暴徒，并“对他们的态度表示感谢”。第二军区司令的代表南兰上校，在事后接见他们，对他们的行为表示同情和赞许。
    十二月十日　印度尼西亚右派暴徒在棉兰体育馆举行反华大集会，北苏门答腊代省长和第二军区参谋长都在会上讲了话，会后暴徒再度袭击中国驻棉兰领事馆，打伤领事馆三名工作人员。
    一九六六年
    二月三日　有一千多名右派暴徒在印度尼西亚政府纵容下，对中国大使馆进行猖狂的袭击。他们公然打碎了悬挂在大使馆大门上的中国国徽，劫走了刻有“中华人民共和国大使馆”标志的铜牌，并打伤了大使馆一名工作人员。在场的印度尼西亚数十名军警非但袖手旁观，不加制止，而且还对暴徒挥手示意，加以鼓动。在此期间，中国大使馆曾先后数次电话通知印度尼西亚外交部、警察部和机动警察司令部等有关部门，要求他们立即采取有效措施保护大使馆的安全，但是，他们始终没有采取积极行动。
    二月十日　有数百名右派暴徒，对中国驻马辰领事馆进行了猖狂的袭击。
    二月二十三日　印度尼西亚右派势力组织的暴徒袭击了中国驻望加锡领事馆。

    暴徒们还在领事馆门墙上涂写了“纳苏蒂安万岁”的标语。

    三月二十九日　在棉兰当局的纵容下有一千多名自称“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织阿里夫·拉赫曼安贝拉旅”的暴徒，再次疯狂地袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆。暴徒行凶时，专门负责守卫中国领事馆的军警，对暴徒未采取任何制止措施。
    四月十五日　印度尼西亚陆军部队在装甲车的掩护下伙同右派暴徒，共一千多人，疯狂地袭击了中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆。他们打伤了一等秘书吕子波、副武官时心仁等中国外交官员五人，甚至公然向大使馆人员连续开枪数十发，工作人员赵小寿胸部中弹，伤势严重。他们在临走时还大喊“美国万岁”、“我们完成了苏哈托伯伯叫我们捣毁中国大使馆的任务”等口号。
    四月十九日　印度尼西亚右派暴徒约三百人，在三名警察官的率领下，破坏和强占了中国驻雅加达总领事馆。他们宣称：“我们是奉第五军区司令阿米尔伯伯的命令来接管中国总领事馆的。从今天起，这座房子就是我们的了。”五月二十二日在雅加达第五军区司令部公然支持下已正式把中国总领事馆办公处移交给“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”作为它的“总部”。

    五月四日　印度尼西亚右派暴徒三十多人，在军警配合下，破坏和霸占了中国驻望加锡领事馆，并且挂上“卡米总部”的大幅横布。
    五月七日　在印度尼西亚苏门答腊防御区际司令部和第二军区当局的支持下，公然唆使蒋帮特务分子，胁迫华侨在棉兰举行反华集会和游行，他们在苏门答腊防御区际司令部接受了防御区际司令的代表、参谋长莫斯基达准将的“检阅”。并且，再一次猖狂地袭击了中国驻棉兰领事馆，叫喊“苏哈托伯伯万岁”等口号。
    五月二十八日　印度尼西亚右派暴徒伙同蒋帮分子四十多人，在南加里曼丹武装军警的全力协助和配合下，破坏和霸占中国驻马辰领事馆。当暴徒们将中国领事馆交由第十军区司令部“接管”时，第十军区司令沙比粦·默赫达尔竟公然对他们的暴行“表示敬意”。　（新华社）
