    A Living Textbook of Class Struggle
    A group of Tibetan emancipated serfs held a forum, warmly praising the Sichuan Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe's
    performance of the drama "Song of the Slaves," considering it a good play that sings the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's ethnic policies, and the revolutionary spirit of slaves.
    A group of Tibetan emancipated serfs recently held separate forums in Beijing, warmly praising the Sichuan Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe's performance of the drama "Song of the Slaves." They said it is a good play that sings the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's ethnic policies, and the revolutionary spirit of slaves, and it is a play of their own, the emancipated serfs.
    With boundless excitement, they said that for thousands of years, the hardworking and brave serfs and slaves created a brilliant history and boundless wealth, but they were deprived of all rights, even the freedom to speak. Today, the Party and Chairman Mao led the vast number of serfs and slaves to stand up, not only politically and economically, but also to ascend to the stage and become the protagonists, shining heroes. This was something their ancestors could not even dream of. They said that the era has arrived for serfs and slaves to hold their heads high in culture. The vast number of emancipated slaves, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, drive away all the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, and man-eating beasts who have ruled the stage for thousands of years, seize the cultural front held by representatives of the bourgeoisie, and resolutely plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    "Song of the Slaves" is the first large-scale drama reflecting the heroic struggle of the Liangshan Yi people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The drama, through the process of the protagonist Jueha's growth into a heroic figure in the struggle, sings the praises of the great revolutionary struggle of hundreds of thousands of slaves in Liangshan under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, who thoroughly destroyed the evil slave system and leaped from slave society across several centuries to socialist society. It sings the praises of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's ethnic policies in the Liangshan area. The play focuses on publicizing Chairman Mao's idea that "national struggle, in the final analysis, is a question of class struggle," grasps the class contradictions and class struggle, and vividly illustrates the truth that "where there are classes, there is class struggle; where there is oppression, there is resistance."
    Many of the Tibetan emancipated serfs who participated in the forum were serfs for generations, suffering from the cruel exploitation, oppression, and persecution of the serf owners. Some of them were maimed by the serf owners and bandits using cruel tortures. They have an irreconcilable deep hatred for class enemies and the deepest class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. They said that as long as a play sings the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, the emancipated serfs and the working people, and strikes at the serf owners and reactionaries, they will welcome it and love it. Although some of these emancipated serfs do not understand Chinese and some are blind, they either only use their eyes to watch or only use their ears to listen, and they watch it again and again, and listen to it again and again. Every time they watch "Song of the Slaves," they cannot restrain their excitement.
    Emancipated serfs Bude, the head of Laxi Township in Baqing County, Tibet Autonomous Region, and Ciden, the head of Chazi Township in Angren County, said that "Song of the Slaves" not only accuses the serf owners of cruel and barbaric oppression and exploitation, but more importantly, it sings the praises of the vast number of slaves' fearless revolutionary spirit in bravely fighting against the serf owners under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. They said that "Song of the Slaves" greatly boosted the morale of our emancipated serfs and deflated the arrogance of the serf owners. This play is not only a revolutionary struggle history of the Yi emancipated serfs, but also a revolutionary struggle history of the vast number of Tibetan serfs. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our re-created parents, and the great Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of all our ethnic groups. Without the Party and without Chairman Mao, there would be no us, and there would be no bright and splendid new life for all ethnic groups today. After watching this play, we hate the serf owners and all reactionaries even more, love the Party and Chairman Mao even more, and admire and support Mao Zedong Thought even more.
    Emancipated serfs Qunze and Caideng Jianzan, interns at the Tibet Nationalities Institute in Beijing, said that in the past, we thought that only the Tibetan serf owners were the most brutal, the most reactionary, and the most barbaric. After watching "Song of the Slaves," we understood that crows are all black under the sky, and serf owners, landlords, and all exploiting classes are all equally bad. They are all poisonous snakes in human skin. But now some people are even talking nonsense that there are good people and honest officials in the exploiting classes. Their purpose is to make us forget class and forget class struggle so that their reactionary conspiracy to restore capitalism can succeed. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Anything reactionary, if you don't hit it, it won't fall." This is an absolutely true truth. "Song of the Slaves" tells us that no matter which ethnic group wants to be liberated, it must take up guns to carry out armed struggle. "Song of the Slaves" is a living textbook of class struggle. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget the bitterness of class, never forget the hatred of class, and never forget class struggle. We must carry the revolution through to the end and eliminate all man-eating wolves and all ghosts and monsters in the world!
    These Tibetan emancipated serfs deeply love revolutionary modern drama. Every time they watch "Song of the Slaves," they pour out their strong, clear-cut feelings of love and hate. Although some people do not understand Chinese, they can fully understand the plot because the play reflects the suffering and struggles they have personally experienced. Bude, who is blind, is a strong and unyielding man. When the bandits gouged out his eyes, he endured the intense pain with anger and did not shed a single tear in front of the enemy. But when he "listened" to "Song of the Slaves" in the theater, his boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for class enemies surged into his heart, and he couldn't help but cry. Emancipated serfs Longzhen and Zhengdian Lamu, interns at the Tibet Nationalities Institute in Beijing, said that when they were watching the play, they couldn't tell whether the events on stage were the affairs of their Yi brothers or a replay of their past lives. They were completely captivated by the plot, and the emotions on and off the stage were tightly intertwined.
    During its performance in Beijing, "Song of the Slaves" was also warmly welcomed by workers, peasants, soldiers, and other audiences. In the seven years since its birth, the play has undergone twelve major revisions and hundreds of minor revisions. The entire process of revision and performance is a process of the cultural troupe's creative staff and actors repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works, combining with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the masses of slaves. As members of the work team, they participated in the earth-shaking democratic reform movement in the Liangshan area, struggled together with the slave masses, and established a flesh-and-blood class relationship with the slave masses. Therefore, they had a strong desire to create heroic images of the slave masses and reflect the revolutionary struggle of the slave masses.

    一部阶级斗争的活教材
    一批藏族翻身农奴举行座谈，热烈赞扬四川凉山彝族自治州文工团
    演出的话剧《奴隶之歌》，认为这是一部歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂党的民族政策、歌颂奴隶革命精神的好戏
    一批藏族翻身农奴最近在北京分别举行座谈会，热烈赞扬四川省凉山彝族自治州文工团演出的话剧《奴隶之歌》。说它是一部歌颂毛泽东思想、歌颂党的民族政策、歌颂奴隶革命精神的好戏，是他们翻身奴隶自己的戏。
    他们怀着无比激动的心情说，勤劳勇敢的广大农奴和奴隶千百年来创造了辉煌的历史，创造了无穷的财富，但是，却被剥夺了一切权利，甚至连说话的自由都没有。今天，党和毛主席领导广大农奴和奴隶翻了身，他们不但在政治上经济上站起来了，而且还登上了戏剧舞台，成了舞台上的主人公，成了光芒四射的英雄人物。这是他们祖祖辈辈过去连做梦也想不到的。他们说，农奴们、奴隶们在文化上扬眉吐气的时代到来了。以毛泽东思想武装起来的广大翻身奴隶一定要同全国工农兵一起，把几千年来统治舞台的帝王将相、才子佳人、吃人的野兽全部赶走，把掌握在资产阶级代表人物手里的文化阵地夺过来，坚决插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    《奴隶之歌》是第一部反映凉山彝族人民在党和毛主席的领导下英勇斗争的大型话剧。剧中通过主人公觉哈这个英雄形象在斗争中成长的过程，歌颂了凉山几十万奴隶在党和毛主席的领导下，彻底摧毁万恶的奴隶制度，从奴隶社会跨越几个世纪飞跃到社会主义社会的伟大革命斗争，歌颂了毛泽东思想、党的民族政策在凉山地区取得的伟大胜利。这个剧着力宣传了毛主席的“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题”的思想，抓住了阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，生动形象地阐明了“哪里有阶级，哪里就有阶级斗争；哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗”的真理。
    参加座谈会的这批藏族翻身农奴中有许多人祖祖辈辈都是农奴，受尽了农奴主残酷的剥削、压榨和迫害。其中有的被农奴主和叛匪施过毒刑而成了残废。他们对阶级敌人有着不共戴天的深仇大恨，对党和毛主席有着最深厚的阶级感情。他们说，只要哪部戏是歌颂毛泽东思想，歌颂翻身奴隶和劳动人民，打击奴隶主、打击反动派的，他们就欢迎，他们就热爱。这批翻身农奴中虽然有些人不懂汉语，有的人双目失明，但是他们或者只用眼睛看，或者只用耳朵听，而且看了一遍又一遍，听了一遍又一遍。每次看《奴隶之歌》的时候，他们总是无法抑制自己激动的心情。
    翻身农奴、西藏自治区巴青县拉稀乡乡长布德、昂仁县查孜乡乡长茨登等说，《奴隶之歌》不只是控诉奴隶主残酷野蛮的压迫和剥削，更重要的是它歌颂了广大奴隶在党和毛主席的领导下同奴隶主进行英勇搏斗的大无畏革命精神。他们说，《奴隶之歌》大大长了我们翻身奴隶的志气，灭了奴隶主的威风。这个剧不仅是一部彝族翻身奴隶的革命斗争史，也是藏族广大农奴的革命斗争史。共产党毛主席是我们的再生父母，伟大的毛泽东思想是我们各族人民的命根子。没有党，没有毛主席，就没有我们，就没有各族人民今天光辉灿烂的新生活。看了这个戏以后，我们对奴隶主、对一切反动派更加仇恨，对党对毛主席更加热爱，对毛泽东思想更加崇拜，更加拥护。
    翻身农奴、西藏民族学院在京实习生群则和才登坚赞等说，过去我们以为只有藏族农奴主最残暴、最反动、最野蛮，看了《奴隶之歌》以后，我们懂得了天下的乌鸦一般黑，天下的农奴主、地主、一切剥削阶级都是一样坏，他们都是披着人皮的毒蛇。可是现在有些人竟然胡说什么剥削阶级里也有好人，也有清官，他们的目的就是要使我们忘掉阶级，忘掉阶级斗争，好让他们复辟资本主义的反动阴谋得逞。毛主席指出：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”这是千真万确的真理。《奴隶之歌》告诉我们，不管哪个民族要想得到解放，非拿起枪杆进行武装斗争不可。《奴隶之歌》是一部阶级斗争的活教材。我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，永远不忘阶级苦，永远不忘阶级仇，永远不忘阶级斗争。我们一定要把革命进行到底，把世界上一切吃人的恶狼、一切牛鬼蛇神通通消灭光！
    这些藏族翻身农奴非常热爱革命现代剧。他们每一次看《奴隶之歌》的时候，都倾注了自己强烈的爱憎分明的感情。有些人虽然不懂汉语，但是他们完全能够理解剧情，因为剧中反映的正是他们自己亲身经历的苦难和斗争。双目失明的布德是一个坚强的硬骨头，当叛匪挖去他双目的时候，他满含愤怒的烈火，忍受住剧烈的疼痛，在敌人面前没有掉下一滴眼泪。但是当他在剧场里“听”《奴隶之歌》的时候，对党和毛主席无限的爱和对阶级敌人刻骨的仇恨，一齐涌上了他的心头，他忍不住哭了。翻身农奴、西藏民族学院在京实习生龙珍和正殿拉姆说，她们在看剧的时候，分不清台上演的是彝族兄弟的事，还是自己过去生活的重演。她们完全被剧情吸引住了，台上台下的感情紧紧地交融在一起。
    《奴隶之歌》在北京演出期间，还受到工农兵和其他观众的热烈欢迎。这个剧诞生七年来，前后大修改十二次，小修改上百次。整个修改、演出的过程，正是文工团的创作人员和演员反复学习毛主席著作，与工农兵群众、与奴隶群众相结合的过程。他们作为工作队的一员，曾参加过凉山地区翻天覆地的民主改革运动，同奴隶群众一起斗争，同奴隶群众建立了血肉相连的阶级感情，因此产生了塑造奴隶群众的英雄形象、反映奴隶群众革命斗争的强烈愿望。
