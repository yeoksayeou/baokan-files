    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th – A. Bingham, a member of the Canadian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation who was invited to visit our country, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters: "Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary teacher, the second Lenin. Mao Zedong Thought has comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism and is a beacon guiding the Chinese people and the people of the world in their revolution."
    He said: "Mao Zedong Thought not only points out the direction forward for the Chinese people, but also points out the direction of revolution for the people of the world. Mao Zedong's works are welcomed by the people of the world, and the people of the world regard them as truth."
    A. Bingham made these remarks to the agency's reporter here on the 3rd while discussing his impressions of his visit to China. He remained in Guangzhou for a few more days to recuperate after the delegation left China due to illness. He has now left here to return to his country.
    He said that Mao Zedong's works are accessible in language, rich in content, and close to the masses, making them easily understandable to the working people. Now, not only are the Chinese people working hard to study Mao Zedong's works, from which they obtain guidance for their actions and struggles, but the working people of the world are also studying Mao Zedong's works.
    A. Bingham praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, China's face has undergone tremendous changes in seventeen years, and it has stood tall in the world as a country with a brand new face. The Chinese people work for the benefit of all the people, and in their work, they do not consider personal interests but are wholeheartedly devoted to the collective. They have a high degree of political consciousness and, through studying Mao Zedong's works, clearly understand that they work for the revolution, and everyone is moving towards a common revolutionary goal. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles.
    A. Bingham also refuted the fallacy that China is increasingly being "isolated." He said that it is only the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries who are trying to isolate China, while the revolutionary people of the world, regardless of various obstacles, are eagerly seeking to understand the new China. He said: "China is the most resolute country in the world in the anti-imperialist struggle. China is full of light everywhere. I love the Chinese people. Just like many friends in various countries, although I am seventy-four years old this year, I still want to come and see the new China myself."

    加拿大朋友说全世界劳动人民在学习毛主席著作
    毛泽东是伟大的革命导师，是第二个列宁
    新华社广州七日电　应邀来我国访问的加拿大—中国友好协会代表团团员阿·宾汉在接见新华社记者时说：“毛泽东是一位伟大的革命导师，是第二个列宁。毛泽东思想全面发展了马克思列宁主义，是指导中国人民和全世界人民革命的灯塔。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想不仅为中国人民指出了前进的方向，而且为全世界人民指出了革命的方向。毛泽东著作受到世界人民的欢迎，全世界人民把它作为真理。”
    阿·宾汉是三日在这里向本社记者畅谈访华观感时这样说的。他因为养病，在代表团离开中国后继续在广州休养了几天，现在他已离开这里回国。
    他说，毛泽东著作语言通俗，内容丰富，接近群众，劳动人民一看就懂。现在不仅中国人民努力学习毛泽东著作，从中得到指导他们行动和斗争的方向和动力，世界劳动人民也在学习毛泽东著作。
    阿·宾汉赞扬中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。他说，由于毛泽东思想的指导，中国面貌在十七年中发生了巨大的变化，已经以一个具有崭新面貌的国家屹立在这个世界上。中国人民为全体人民的利益而工作，他们在工作中不考虑个人利益，一心为集体。他们有高度的政治觉悟，在大学毛泽东著作中，明确为了革命而工作，大家朝着一个共同的革命目标前进。在毛泽东思想的指导下，他们能创造出奇迹。
    阿·宾汉还驳斥了所谓中国日益被“孤立”的谬论。他说，企图孤立中国的，只是帝国主义和各国反动派，而世界革命人民却不顾各种阻挠，如饥似渴地想了解新中国。他说：“中国是世界上反帝斗争最坚决的国家，中国到处充满光明，我热爱中国人民。正象世界各国许多朋友一样，我今年虽然七十四岁了，但还要亲自来看看新中国。”
