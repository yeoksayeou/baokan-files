	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on the Issue of Transporting Willing-to-Return Injured Overseas Chinese from Indonesia
	Firmly Demands that the Indonesian Government Provide a Clear and Positive Response on the Issue of Transporting Overseas Chinese
	Strongly Protests Again the Indonesian Government's Further Cruel Persecution of Overseas Chinese

	Sending ships to transport injured overseas Chinese back to China is an inalienable right of the Chinese government to protect its citizens abroad. The Chinese government once again proposes that the two governments immediately begin negotiations on the specific arrangements for the Chinese government to send ships to transport overseas Chinese.

	New China News Agency, June 29th: On the 29th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China handed a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China, firmly demanding that the Indonesian government immediately provide a clear and positive response to the issue of the Chinese government sending ships to transport willing-to-return injured overseas Chinese, and proposing that negotiations on the specific arrangements begin in the second week of July.

	The note also strongly protests the Indonesian government's cruel persecution of overseas Chinese and once again demands that the Indonesian government immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese.

	The full text of the note is as follows:

	To the Indonesian Embassy in China:

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends greetings to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China and states the following:

	On May 18th, the Chinese government sent a note to the Indonesian government, deciding to send ships to Indonesia in the near future to bring back willing-to-return injured overseas Chinese, and requesting that the Indonesian government respond promptly and make necessary arrangements. However, for more than a month, despite repeated inquiries from the Chinese government, the Indonesian government has deliberately delayed its response, repeatedly claiming that the Indonesian side needs to conduct research. On June 15th, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs even said that "no overseas Chinese have requested to return to their country," and demanded that the Chinese Embassy provide a list of overseas Chinese who wish to return. This fully shows that the Indonesian government is deliberately creating obstacles and unreasonably obstructing and hindering the urgent issue of the Chinese government sending ships to transport injured overseas Chinese.

	It is known to all that the persecution of a large number of overseas Chinese and their requests to return to their country are the result of the Indonesian government's mad anti-China and anti-Chinese policies. Arranging ships and assisting injured overseas Chinese to return to their country is originally the responsibility that the Indonesian government cannot shirk. The Chinese government has made this reasonable and legitimate request to the Indonesian government, but it has been met with arrogant rejection. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government, out of concern for the safety of injured overseas Chinese, has decided to send ships to transport them back to China. You are still trying every means to obstruct this. I wonder what your intentions are? Do you really want to completely drive these persecuted overseas Chinese to their deaths? The Indonesian government's unreasonable attitude has caused great indignation among the Chinese people.

	You claim that "no overseas Chinese have requested to return to their country," which is a complete lie. Tens of thousands of persecuted overseas Chinese have lost their homes and livelihoods and are in dire straits. They naturally seek to return to their country for a way out. In fact, they have long requested the Indonesian government to leave the country and return to their homeland. The Chinese Embassy and Consulate have also continuously received applications from injured overseas Chinese requesting to return to their country. Your fabrication that overseas Chinese do not wish to return only further exposes your plot to obstruct and sabotage the Chinese government's sending of ships to bring back injured overseas Chinese. Your demand that the Chinese Embassy provide a list of injured overseas Chinese who wish to return is nothing more than to further persecute the overseas Chinese on the list and force them to give up their request to return to their country. The Chinese government firmly opposes these vicious plots.

	While obstructing the Chinese government's sending of ships to transport injured overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government has taken a series of even more vicious measures against overseas Chinese. Preliminary information indicates that recently in Jakarta, Palembang, Aceh, Padang, and Mamuju, you have continuously committed acts of persecution against overseas Chinese, looting, beating, arresting, and even massacring innocent overseas Chinese. You have ordered overseas Chinese in some places to leave their original residences within a limited time, forcing a large number of overseas Chinese to become refugees. You have used the pretext of "registration," "screening," and "supervision" of overseas Chinese to brutally violate the personal freedom of overseas Chinese. You have also announced the reimplementation and expansion of the 1959 No. 10 anti-Chinese decree, attempting to deprive a large number of overseas Chinese of their means of livelihood. To be honest, is there any government in the world that, like yours, so blatantly disregards its commitments and cruelly persecutes foreigners with racism, so brutally tramples on international norms? The Chinese government once again strongly protests to the Indonesian government and once again demands that the Indonesian government immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese.

	It must be pointed out that in the situation where Chinese citizens abroad are being persecuted and their lives and property are in danger, the Chinese government sending ships to transport them back to their country is an inalienable right of the Chinese government to protect its citizens abroad. Chinese ships have already been arranged and are ready to set sail at any time. The Chinese government firmly demands that the Indonesian government immediately provide a clear and positive response to the issue of the Chinese government sending ships to transport willing-to-return injured overseas Chinese. The Chinese government once again proposes that the two governments immediately begin negotiations on the specific arrangements for the Chinese government to send ships to transport overseas Chinese, and proposes that the negotiations begin in the second week of July. The Chinese government designates Mr. Yao Dengshan, Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, as the chief representative of the Chinese side, and Mr. Xu Ren, Consul-General of China in Jakarta, as the representative. The Chinese government requests that the Indonesian government promptly appoint corresponding representatives to negotiate with the Chinese representatives.

	With the highest respect,

	Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

    我外交部关于接运自愿返国受害华侨问题照会印尼政府
    坚决要求印尼政府就我接侨问题作肯定答复
    再次强烈抗议印尼政府进一步残酷迫害华侨罪行
    派船接运受害华侨回国，是中国政府不容剥夺的护侨权利。中国政府再次建议，两国政府立即就中国政府派船接侨的具体安排问题进行谈判。
    新华社二十九日讯　中国外交部二十九日把一件照会交给印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，坚决要求印度尼西亚政府就中国派船接运自愿返国的受害华侨问题立即作出明确和肯定的答复，并且建议在七月的第二个星期内开始就具体安排问题进行谈判。
    照会还强烈抗议印度尼西亚政府残酷地迫害华侨，并且再次要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止对华侨的一切迫害。
    照会的全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并申述如下：
    中国政府五月十八日曾照会印度尼西亚政府，决定在最近期间派遣船只前往印度尼西亚，接回自愿返国的受害华侨，要求印度尼西亚政府迅速作出答复，并作出必要的安排。但是，一个多月以来，尽管中国政府不断催问，印度尼西亚政府却故意拖延不复，再三推托说，印度尼西亚方面需要进行研究。六月十五日，印度尼西亚外交部竟然说什么“没有华侨提出回国要求”，并且要求中国大使馆提供自愿返国的华侨名单。这充分表明，印度尼西亚政府蓄意制造障碍，对中国政府派船接运受害华侨这样一个迫切的问题，进行无理的刁难和阻挠。
    众所周知，大批华侨遭受迫害、要求回国是疯狂反华排华的印度尼西亚政府一手造成的。安排船只，协助受害华侨回国，本来是印度尼西亚政府不容推卸的责任。中国政府曾向印度尼西亚政府提出这一正当和合理的要求，却遭到了蛮横的拒绝。在这种情况下，中国政府出于对受害华侨安危的关怀，才决定自行派船接运受害华侨回国。你们又想方设法进行阻挠。试问，你们的居心究竟何在？难道你们一定要把这些被迫害得无以为生的华侨完全置于死地而后快吗？印度尼西亚政府这种蛮不讲理的态度，引起了中国人民极大的愤慨。
    你们说“没有华侨提出回国要求”，是彻头彻尾的撒谎。成千上万遭受迫害的华侨，倾家荡产，衣食无着，正处于水深火热之中。他们为了活路要求回国，是理所当然的。事实上，他们早就向印度尼西亚政府提出离境回国的要求，中国大使馆和领事馆也不断接到受害华侨要求回国的申请。你们捏造什么华侨不愿回国，只能更加暴露你们阻挠和破坏中国派船接回受害华侨的阴谋。你们要求中国大使馆提供自愿返国的受害华侨的名单，无非是要对名单中的华侨进一步迫害，胁迫他们放弃回国的要求。中国政府坚决反对你们这些恶毒的阴谋。
    印度尼西亚政府在阻挠中国派船接运受害华侨的同时，对华侨采取了一系列更加恶毒的迫害措施。据初步了解，最近你们在雅加达、巨港、亚齐、巴东、美玛等地，又连续制造了迫害华侨的暴行，对无辜华侨进行了抢掠、殴打、逮捕甚至屠杀。你们勒令一些地方的华侨限期离开原住地，迫使大批华侨流离失所。你们借口对华侨实行“登记”、“甄别”和“监督”，粗暴地侵犯华侨的人身自由。你们还宣布要重新推行和扩大一九五九年第十号排华法令，企图剥夺广大华侨的生计。老实说，世界上哪有一个国家的政府象你们这样，如此不顾信义，残酷地对外侨进行种族主义迫害，粗暴地践踏国际关系准则。中国政府再次向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈的抗议，并再次要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止对华侨的一切迫害。
    必须严正指出，中国政府在本国侨民横遭迫害，生命财产毫无保障的情况下，派船接运他们回国，是中国政府不容剥夺的护侨权利。中国的船只早已安排就绪，准备随时启航。中国政府坚决要求印度尼西亚政府就中国派船接运自愿返国的受害华侨问题立即作出明确和肯定的答复。中国政府再次建议，两国政府立即就中国政府派船接侨的具体安排问题进行谈判，并建议谈判在七月的第二个星期内开始举行。中国政府指定中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山先生作为中国方面的首席代表，中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁先生为代表。中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府迅速指派相应的代表，同中国代表谈判。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国外交部
    一九六六年六月二十九日
                        于北京
