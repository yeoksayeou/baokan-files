    Brief Remarks
    "Concise" Deception
    U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg has again put forward so-called "two-point summary of peace talk proposals." The U.S. propaganda machine is making every effort to promote this, saying that it shows the U.S. attitude has "gone beyond the U.S. fourteen-point plan for seeking peace in Vietnam published at the beginning of the year." In fact, the so-called "two-point summary" is just a variation of the "fourteen-point plan." U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey inadvertently revealed its essence. He said that Goldberg was merely "briefly explaining the fourteen points," merely "reiterating existing U.S. policy."
    Since the "fourteen-point plan" has been exposed as a deception, is "briefly explaining" this deception not also a deception?
    The More Respectable You Try to Be, the Less Respectable You Are
    U.S. Democratic Senator Clark advocated that "the United States should withdraw from Vietnam immediately as soon as it can withdraw with dignity," but "we cannot let people drive them into the sea."
    U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam was inherently undignified. If it withdraws from South Vietnam, where can it find any dignity? The more the American aggressors try to delay, the more undignified they will inevitably become, and in the end they can only be driven into the sea by the Vietnamese people.

    三言两语
    “扼要”的骗局
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡又提出所谓“和谈建议两点总结”。美国宣传机器竭力宣传，这是表明美国的态度已“超出了美国在年初发表的争取越南和平的十四点计划”。其实，所谓“两点总结”不过是“十四点计划”的变种。美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基就不打自招地道破了它的实质。他说，戈德堡只是“扼要说明十四点”，只是“重申美国现有的政策”。
    既然“十四点计划”已被揭穿是个骗局，“扼要地说明”这个骗局，难道就不是骗局了吗？
    越要体面越不体面
    美国民主党参议员克拉克主张“美国应当在一俟能够体面地撤出时便立即撤出越南”，但是“我们不能让人家赶到海里去”。
    美帝国主义侵略越南本来就是不体面的。它从南越撤出，哪里还能有什么体面？美国侵略者越想往后拖，就必然越不体面，而且最后只能被越南人民赶到海里去。
