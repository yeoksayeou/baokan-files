Dear friends:

The road of struggle before us is broad and long. The path is strewn with blades and thorns, for this is the path of a people fighting for the freedom and unity of their homeland. The great Chinese people stand at the forefront of the peoples of all countries. Let us, as comrades-in-arms, walk side by side and hand in hand on this great road! The blades and thorns will pierce our feet and make them bleed, but the blood we shed as we march forward will bloom into flowers along the sides of this road for future generations.

On this long journey, many of us will fall, but they will become torches held high along this path, guiding the peoples of the world to freedom. Respected comrades of the Chinese Communist Party and the National People's Congress, respected comrades of the government of the People's Republic of China and the National People's Congress, dear friends and comrades attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers:

First of all, I would like to express my sincere and warm gratitude to the Chinese people and their glorious leaders for their enthusiastic and fraternal welcome to us.

Today, we are being received by this great China, which has many glorious traditions. One of these traditions is sincere and fraternal hospitality. China knows how to receive its friends in any situation, always so frank, sympathetic, and respectful.

The Malian delegation is very pleased to come to participate in the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers. The Malian delegation will do its utmost, out of goodwill, to contribute as much as possible to the complete success of this historic meeting.

The Malian delegation first of all pays warm tribute to the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian and African Writers' Association, which is loyal to the principles and ideas of the Association and has shown revolutionary tenacity and firmness. The delegation also salutes the representatives of various countries who have come in large numbers without hesitation to attend this conference.

Dear comrades, by traveling a long way to Beijing, you have actually achieved the first victory. This will lay a solid foundation for us to frustrate the various plots of those who seek to sabotage the unity of the forces of the peoples of all countries in their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and to decisively fight for the freedom and peace of the peoples of all countries over the next ten days.

Finally, the Malian delegation, in the name of the people of Mali, their party, and President Modibo Keita, the General Secretary of the Party, expresses its respect to the people of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and its leaders. The delegation especially wishes to express friendly respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the tireless and indefatigable fighter who has devoted all his energy and time to the cause of socialism and the defense of the interests of the proletariat of the whole world. Our language is too poor to even briefly recount all that Chairman Mao has done for the peoples of all countries, and the expectations of the peoples of the world for him and the Chinese revolution.

Dear comrades, the Malian delegation believes that this emergency conference is being held at a time when the international situation is exceptionally favorable for the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism and old and new colonialism and their lackeys. Although imperialism has never been so aggressive, it has never been so full of sharp contradictions as it is today. We should draw the most beneficial lessons from this. We should act in unison with the peoples of the world, with the unity of anti-imperialist forces, and with the consolidation and enhancement of the revolutionary consciousness of the Asian and African peoples, to oppose the aggressive forces of imperialism, which are now in a state of sharp contradictions, internal divisions, and complete disarray.

We pay tribute to the heroic people of Vietnam, and we support the heroic people of Vietnam. The inevitable victories of the Vietnamese people will greatly and effectively prove that our cause is just, and that we must strive to defend this cause.

We pay tribute to and support the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are bravely resisting imperialist aggression and subversive plots. To the peoples of our brother countries who have been attacked by reactionary military coups instigated by imperialism and its lackeys (who are against the freedom, peace, and security of revolutionary countries), we say: Take courage. We tell them: March on to final victory, because a true revolutionary people may suffer a defeat, but a just war waged by the people for the people's welfare and for the establishment of a just and prosperous society will never fail.

Dear comrades, take courage, the international situation is very favorable for our victory. International public opinion condemns imperialism and exposes those who divide the anti-imperialist front. We should adhere to the correct path we are taking, not only because the international situation is favorable to us, but also because the peoples of our various countries are in an inspiring domestic environment. We live for struggle, and it is precisely because of this that if we really want to move forward, we should overcome the difficulties we face.

Comrades, our emergency conference is convened at a time when the great people of the People's Republic of China, who are faithful to their traditions of struggle and loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, are advancing in great strides on the path of the cultural revolution. The People's Republic of China has carried out revolutions in all aspects and is continuing to do so, making all sciences serve humanity.

China, let us experience its achievements today and benefit from them. We should believe that the experience of China tells us that without a healthy and vigorous national culture of the people, no revolution can be realized. The construction of socialism, the struggle for freedom, peace, and dignity, and the general struggle for the world proletariat, all these are inseparable from the cultural revolution.

Indeed, without living in the homes of the people, in their fields, in their factories, and living with them, singing with them, and shedding tears with them, there can be no people's culture. Writing well, singing well, drawing well, and sculpting well, all these are good. But if all these become the personal knowledge or material monopoly of those who can do so, then they are worthless. Only when culture in expression and in emotion belongs to the people, that is, when workers, peasants, technicians, soldiers, and intellectuals all contribute without prejudice and privilege, does it have value.

Mali has a proverb: "Soy sauce is good, but do not forget that soy sauce cannot be made without ordinary water." Therefore, no matter how valuable culture is, if its foundation is not rooted in the people, it is worthless. In Mali, people also say, "The ears of corn connect the sheaves, the sheaves connect the stacks, but no one can make the stacks accommodate the sheaves." We must never forget that we come from the people, and the best way to understand the people and arm the people is to return to the people.

The Malian delegation pays tribute to the cultural revolution being carried out by the Chinese people and hopes that this new weapon of basic experience, absorbed by the people of Mali and the peoples of the world, will help to consolidate their national independence.

No people of any country can progress if they rely only on the past. No people of any country in the world can advance if they think that only foreign things are valuable. First of all, one must completely live in one's own land to be able to say that one lives with people of other countries.

Dear comrades, the duty of Asian and African writers is the duty of the vanguard. We should raise the banner of the socialist revolution to oppose the cultural aggression of imperialism. As Chairman Mao has instructed, we must never forget that a fierce and sharp class struggle is being waged on the cultural front. Our task is to strive for victory. The cultural offensive of imperialism is one of its most dangerous weapons because it is hidden under the slogans of friendship and freedom.

The Malian delegation congratulates the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers on its success. It is convened at a time when the international situation is characterized by imperialism's intensified aggression, which seeks to lead the anti-imperialist struggle astray and destroy the alliance and friendship. Therefore, in the long run, our only friends are the people, our only friends are the people fighting for liberation in every corner of the world, those who are uncompromising against imperialism, old and new colonialism. Our duty is to cultivate and consolidate this friendship forever. When the enemies of the people, disguised reactionaries, want to be friends with us, be careful. Mali has a proverb: "When your new friend asks you to help him remove his old friend's head, be careful." Therefore, when imperialism and colonialism, which are slaughtering our brothers everywhere, sing about "cultural freedom," "democracy," "freedom," "peace," etc., they can never be our friends.

Asian and African writers, let us raise the banner of the cultural revolution to oppose imperialism and its lackeys.

Long live the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers!

Long live the struggle of the peoples of the world against imperialism and its lackeys!

Long live the world socialist cultural revolution for the freedom, independence, and peace of the peoples of the world!

Long live the unity of the Asian and African peoples!

Long live the friendship and peace between the peoples of all countries!

### 马里代表团长戈洛戈的致词

专栏：

    马里代表团长戈洛戈的致词亲爱的朋友们：
    我们面前斗争的道路是广阔而漫长的。道路上布满了利刃和荆棘，因为这是为祖国的自由和统一而斗争的人民的道路。伟大的中国人民站在各国人民的最前列，让我们作为战友，在这条大道上肩并肩，手拉手，共同前进！利刃和荆棘将刺得我们的脚踝流出鲜血、但我们向前迈步时所流出的鲜血，将在这大道两旁，为后代培育出鲜花。
    在这漫长的路途中，我们中间会有很多人倒下，但是他们将成为延展在这条道路上的高高举起的火炬，指引世界人民去取得自由。尊敬的中国共产党和代表同志们，尊敬的中华人民共和国政府和全国人民代表大会的同志们，亲爱的参加亚非作家紧急会议的朋友们和同志们：
    我首先表示向中国人民和她光荣的领导人表示真诚和热烈的谢意，感谢他们对我们热情和兄弟般的欢迎。
    今天接待我们的这个伟大的中国，有着许多光辉的传统，真诚而兄弟般的好客就是这种传统之一。中国懂得在任何情况下接待她的朋友，永远是那么坦率、同情和带着敬意。
    马里代表团很高兴地前来参加亚非作家紧急会议。马里代表团将竭尽全力，出自善意，尽可能地为这次具有历史意义的会见完全成功而作出贡献。
    马里代表团首先向忠于亚非作家协会原则和思想、表现出革命坚韧性和坚定性的亚非作家常设局，致以热烈的敬意。代表团也向毫不犹豫地大批前来参加这次大会的各国代表致敬。
    亲爱的同志们，你们经过长途跋涉来到北京，实际上就已经取得了第一个成就，成为我们在今后十天内挫败那些破坏各国反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义、坚决争取各国人民的自由与和平力量的团结一致的各种阴谋，取得伟大的胜利，打下牢固的基础。
    最后，马里代表团以马里人民、她的党和党的总书记莫迪博·凯塔总统的名义，向中华人民共和国全体人民、中国共产党及其领导人表示敬意。代表团特别要向毛泽东主席，这位把全部精力和时间献给社会主义、献给保卫全世界无产者的利益的事业坚持不懈、毫不疲倦的斗士，致以友好的敬意。我们的语言太贫乏，即使是简短地叙述，也很难叙述毛主席为各国人民所已经作出的一切，和世界各国人民对他和中国革命的期望。
    亲爱的同志们，马里代表认为，这次紧急会议举行的时候，正处于国际形势空前有利于各国人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义及其走狗的斗争发展的时候。帝国主义虽然从来没有这样富于侵略性，但也从来没有象今天这样充满了尖锐的矛盾。我们应当从中吸取最有益的教训。应当以全世界人民的一致行动，以反帝力量的团结一致，以巩固和提高亚非人民的革命意识，来反对帝国主义的侵略势力，而它们正处在矛盾重重、内部分化和完全张惶失措的境地。
    我们向英雄的越南人民致敬，我们支持英雄的越南人民，越南人民必然不断取得的胜利，极大的、有效的证明我们的事业是正义的，也证明我们应当竭力保卫这个事业。
    我们向英勇抗击帝国主义侵略和挑衅阴谋的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民致敬，并对他们表示支持。我们对遭到帝国主义及其仆从（它们反对革命国家的自由、和平和安全）的反动军事政变袭击的兄弟国家的人民说：鼓起勇气。我们对他们说：前进、直到最后胜利，因为真正的革命人民可能会打一次败仗，但是由人民所进行的，为人民的福利，为建立一个公正、繁荣的社会的正义战争，是决不会失败的。
    亲爱的同志们，鼓起勇气，国际形势对我们的胜利是非常有利的。国际舆论谴责帝国主义，揭露那些分裂反帝阵线的人。我们应当坚持我们所走的正确道路，不仅是因为国际形势对我们有利，而且是由于我们各个国家的人民正处在鼓舞人心的国内环境中。我们生活是为了斗争，正是因为如此，如果我们真正要前进的话，我们应该克服面对着的困难。
    同志们，我们的紧急会议召开的时刻正是忠于它的斗争传统的，忠于马列主义原则的中华人民共和国的伟大人民，在文化革命战斗的道路上阔步前进，中华人民共和国已在各方面进行了革命，它正继续进行革命，使各门科学为人类服务。
    中国，让我们就地体验它今天的经验，使我们得到教益。我们应当相信，中国的经验告诉我们，要是不依靠健康的、朝气蓬勃的人民的民族文化，任何革命都不可能实现。社会主义建设，为自由、和平、尊严而进行的斗争，为世界无产阶级进行的总斗争，这一切都是和文化革命分不开的。
    的确，不在人民群众的家里，不在他们的地里，不在他们的工厂里和他们一起生活，一起唱歌，一起流泪，是不可能有人民的文化的。善写、会唱、能作图绘画、会雕刻，这一切都是好的。但是，如果这一切成了那些会这样作的人的个人知识或物质垄断的话，那就一文钱也不值了。只有当文化在表达方面以及在情感方面是属于人民的时候，也就是说，当工人、农民、技术员、士兵和知识分子都毫无偏见和特权而作出贡献的时候，它才有价值。
    马里有句格言：“酱油尽管好，但可不要忘记作酱油离不开普通的水。”因此，不论文化有多么大的价值，如果它的基础不扎在人民中，它就会一文不值。在马里人们还说，麦穗连接麦捆，麦捆连结麦堆，但谁也不能使麦堆去迁就麦捆。我们永远不能忘记我们来自人民，而了解人民和武装人民的最好办法，就是回到人民中去。
    马里代表团向中国人民所进行的文化革命致敬，并期望着作为马里人民以及世界各国人民吸取的这个新武器的基本经验，从而得到巩固自己的民族独立。
    任何一个国家的人民，如果只是依靠过去的东西生存，它就不会进步。世界上任何一个国家的人民，如果认为只有国外的东西才有价值，它就不会前进。首先必须完全生活在自己的国土里，才能说得上和其他国家的人一同生活。
    亲爱的同志们，亚非作家的职责是先锋队的职责。我们应当高举社会主义革命的旗帜反对帝国主义的文化侵略。正如毛主席所指示的那样，永远不要忘记在文化战线上正在进行着一场激烈、尖锐的真正的阶级斗争。我们的任务是争取胜利。帝国主义的文化攻势是他的武器中最危险的一种，因为它隐藏在友谊与自由的口号下。
    马里代表团祝贺亚非作家紧急会议成功，它召开的时候正是国际形势以帝国主义加剧侵略企图，将反帝斗争战线引入歧途，对同盟军和友谊加以破坏为特征的时候。因此，从长远来看，我们唯一的朋友就是人民，我们唯一的朋友是世界上各个角落为解放而战斗的人们，是那些反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义毫不妥协的人们。我们的职责在于永远培养和巩固这种友谊。当人民的敌人，伪装的反动派要同我们交朋友时，要当心，马里有一句格言：“当你的新朋友要求你帮助他搬掉他老朋友的头时，你要当心”。因此，当到处屠杀我们的兄弟的帝国主义和殖民主义歌唱“文化自由”、“民主”、“自由”、“和平”等等时，他们永远不能做我们的朋友。
    亚非作家们，让我们高举文化革命的旗帜，反对帝国主义及其走狗。
    亚非作家紧急会议万岁！
    世界各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争万岁！
    为世界各国人民的自由、独立、和平服务的世界社会主义文化革命万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    各国人民之间的友谊和和平万岁！
