    We also have Revisionists in our school

    Foreword: There is something I can't sleep well without sharing with everyone, so for this assignment, I didn't follow the scope defined by the teacher. Instead, I'm taking this opportunity to tell you about something I urgently need to say. If the teacher thinks it's not okay and gives me a zero, I have no objection.
    The midterm exams are coming up soon, and Teacher × is very "concerned" about us, running to the classroom to lecture us. I'll just pick out a few sentences to talk about. Then I'll talk about what these few sentences illustrate.
    He complained: "Your family gives you seven or eight yuan a month; is that easy? If you don't study hard, first of all, you're letting down your family, letting down your parents!" He commented: "As long as you're not reactionary in politics, you can serve the people by acquiring knowledge." He shouted: "Generally, students from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds are afraid to study, fearing people will say they have a purely academic viewpoint. You study! What are you afraid of? I'll back you up!" How jarring! Such remarks are not uncommon in our school.
      "If you don't study hard, first of all, you're letting down your family, letting down your parents!" I ask, what kind of family and what kind of parents should we be worthy of? How can we be worthy of them by studying well? Are we supposed to tell students from exploiting class families to be worthy of their landlord, rich peasant, and capitalist families and parents? The landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists who haven't been reformed hate the Party, socialism, and the emancipated workers and peasants to the bone. They always dream of restoration, dreaming of the day when Chiang Kai-shek returns to the mainland, slaughtering the revolutionary people and resuming their licentious and shameless exploitative lives (some capitalists still live exploitative lives). They constantly educate their children to take over their class and work for the realization of their conspiracies. If their children want to be worthy of their families and parents, they must resolutely be hostile to the working people, desperately climb up, usurp power, and change the color and nature of our country. Think about it, telling them to be worthy of their families and parents is such blatant indulgence!
    Are we supposed to tell students from worker and poor peasant backgrounds to study to be "worthy" of their families? Telling us to put being worthy of "family and parents first" is a very cunning enticement, attempting to make us indulge in the small circle of our families, content with the status quo, diligently seeking personal gain, forgetting the past bitterness, forgetting the Party's kindness, forgetting the 600 million people, forgetting the two-thirds of the world's population still struggling in deep waters, forgetting class struggle, abandoning the lofty ideal of communism, not making revolution, and comfortably sliding towards revisionism.
      "As long as you're not reactionary in politics," doesn't this mean that there's no need for revolutionization? What's the point of studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought? What's the point of adhering to anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and supporting the liberation struggles of oppressed peoples? What's the point of digging out the roots of revisionism and preventing the restoration of class enemies? As long as you're "not reactionary," that's enough. Isn't this advocating class cooperation? Can it be said that their conspiracy is not peaceful evolution?
    Teacher ×'s so-called "serving the people" is so beautiful and touching! Imagine: a person who puts their family and parents above all else, a person who doesn't listen to the Party's teachings and opposes promoting their own revolutionization, how far are they from the mire of revisionism? How can they talk about "serving the people"?
      "Generally, students from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds are afraid to study." This person is a big liar. Who doesn't know? A large number of them don't care about proletarian politics, spend more than ten hours a day burying themselves in books, almost bursting their brains. Can you say they're afraid to study? "Fearing people will say they have a purely academic viewpoint." They can't hide their tails, they have a guilty conscience, so how can they not be afraid? Instead of educating them to surrender to the proletariat, they're backing up their purely academic viewpoint. Isn't this blatantly encouraging them not to betray their original class, to be enemies of the people, and to compete with the Party?
    Isn't this practicing class reconciliation and abolishing revolution as the key link, using the bourgeoisie's deceptive pacifism, humanism, and bourgeois individualism to corrode the revolutionary will of the youth, and trying to lead the youth onto the wrong path of non-revolution or even counter-revolution? How incompatible is this with the proletarian class education put forward by our Party, using the Marxist-Leninist class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and dialectical materialism viewpoint, that is, using the communist world view to arm the youth, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the youth, and promoting the proletarian revolutionization of the youth! Isn't this revisionist stuff?
    What does Teacher ×'s "concern" for us illustrate? It illustrates that there is revisionism in our school, and there are revisionists in our school. It is very dangerous not to understand this.
    Of course, this is not worth panicking about. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The existence of certain erroneous things is not strange, and there is no need to be afraid. This can enable people to better learn to fight against it. Great storms are not terrible. Human society has developed from great storms." At the same time, we must remember another passage from Chairman Mao: "It is certainly not right to fail to criticize, to watch erroneous ideas spread everywhere, and to allow them to occupy the market. Errors must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be struggled against." We must carry out a tit-for-tat struggle against revisionist monsters and demons, and we must never allow them to spread, we must never coexist peacefully with them, and we must never allow them to be manipulated.
    I firmly believe that revisionists are only a handful after all. We have the Communist Party of China, the great Chairman Mao, and a powerful proletarian dictatorship. All revisionism will be completely shattered. In our school, with the leadership of the Party branch and more than 700 teachers and students closely united around the Party branch, revisionism cannot turn the world upside down, and we will surely advance further and further on the revolutionary road.

### 我们学校里也有修正主义者

    我们学校里也有修正主义者
    慕振奎
    前言：有一件事，不向大家谈谈，连睡觉都睡不好，所以这次作文，我没有按老师划定的范围作，而借此机会，把我迫切要说的一件事向大家说说。如果老师认为不行，给我零分，我也没意见。
    快段中考试了，×老师很“关心”我们，跑到教室里给我们讲了许多。这里只拣其中随便几句谈一谈。然后再说说这几句话说明了什么。
    他责怪：“家里一月给你拿七八元钱，就是老容易？不好好学习，首先来说对不起你家庭，对不起你父母！”他议论：“只要政治上不反动，把知识学到手就能为人民服务。”他嚷道：“一般地、富出身的同学不敢学习，怕人家说自己单纯升学观点。你学吧，怕什么！我给你撑腰！”多么刺耳！这类言论，在我们学校并不少见。
      “不好好学习，首先来说对不起你家庭，对不起你父母！”请问要对得起什么样的家庭，什么样的父母呢？怎样才能用学习好来对得起呢？叫剥削阶级家庭出身的学生对得起他们的地主、富农、资本家家庭和父母吗？没有改造好的地、富、资本家对党、对社会主义、对翻了身的工人、农民恨入骨髓，他们总妄想复辟，做梦也想着有朝一日，蒋介石返回大陆，把革命人民斩尽杀绝，还过自己荒淫无耻的剥削生活（现在有些资本家仍过着剥削生活），他们无时不教育自己的子女，接下他们的班，为他们阴谋的实现卖命。他们的子女要对得起自己的家庭和父母，就必须坚决与劳动人民为敌，拼命往上爬，篡夺政权，使我们的国家变色、变质。请想想，叫他们对得起家庭和父母，这是多么露骨的纵容啊！
    叫我们工人、贫下中农出身的学生为“对得起”自己的家庭而学习吗？叫我们把对得起“家庭和父母放在一切之‘首’”，这是非常狡猾的引诱，企图要我们陶醉于家庭这个小圈圈里，苟且偷安，孜孜以求，忘记过去的苦，忘记党的恩，忘记六亿人民，忘记那占全世界人口三分之二的仍挣扎在水深火热之中的阶级兄弟，忘记阶级斗争，放弃共产主义的远大理想，不革命，舒舒适适地滑向修正主义。
      “在政治上只要不反动”，这岂不是说还要什么革命化？还学马列主义、毛泽东思想干什么？还坚持什么反帝、反修，援助被压迫人民的解放斗争？还搞什么挖掉修正主义根子，防止阶级敌人复辟？只要“不反动”就行了。这难道不是在宣扬阶级合作，其阴谋能说不是和平演变？
    ×老师所谓的“为人民服务”，多么优美动人！试想：一个把自己家庭和父母放在一切之“首”的人，一个不听党的教导，反对促进自己革命化的人，与修正主义的泥坑还有什么距离？怎么能谈得上“为人民服务”呢？
      “一般地、富出身的同学不敢学习”，此人是个大骗子，谁不知道？他们之中很有一部分都不过问无产阶级政治，一天钻书本十多个小时，脑袋都快使崩了，能说是不敢学习？“怕人家说自己单纯升学观点”。尾巴盖不住，做贼心虚，怎么会不怕？不教育他们向无产阶级投降，而为他们的单纯升学观点撑腰，这不是明目张胆在鼓舞他们不背叛原阶级，与人民为敌，与党较量吗？
    这还不是在以实行阶级调和，取消革命为纲，用资产阶级骗人的和平主义、人道主义和资产阶级个人主义去腐蚀青年的革命意志，竭力把青年引上不革命甚至反革命的歧途？这与我们党所提出的以无产阶级的阶级教育为纲，用马克思列宁主义的阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点和辩证唯物主义观点，也就是用共产主义的世界观武装青年，用毛泽东思想武装青年，促进青年无产阶级革命化，多么格格不入啊！这不是修正主义的东西是什么？
    ×老师对我们的“关心”说明了什么？说明我们学校也有修正主义，我们学校也有修正主义者，不了解这一点那是很危险的。
    当然，这并不值得大惊小怪，正如毛主席教导我们的：“某些错误东西的存在是并不奇怪的，也是用不着害怕的，这可以使人们更好地学会同它作斗争。大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”同时，我们还要记住毛主席的另一段教导：“不加批评，看着错误思想到处泛滥，任凭它们去占领市场，当然不行。有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”我们要与修正主义这个牛鬼蛇神针锋相对地开展斗争，决不能任其泛滥，决不能与之和平共处，决不能听其摆布。
    我坚信：修正主义者毕竟只是一小撮，我们有中国共产党，有伟大的毛主席，有强有力的无产阶级专政，一切修正主义必将被彻底粉碎。在我们学校，有党支部的领导，有七百多紧紧团结在党支部周围的师生，修正主义翻不了天，我们必将在革命的道路上前进再前进。
