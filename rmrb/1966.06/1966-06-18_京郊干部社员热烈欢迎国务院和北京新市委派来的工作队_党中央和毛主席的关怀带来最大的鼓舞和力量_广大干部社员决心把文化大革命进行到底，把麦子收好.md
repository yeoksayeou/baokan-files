    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are deeply concerned about agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing and have decided that the State Council and the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee organize work teams to help with the summer harvest work in the counties and districts of Beijing. According to this spirit, the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee issued a call to do a good job in the "Three Summers" (summer harvest, summer planting, summer hoeing) production and strive for a double harvest in the Cultural Revolution and agricultural production. After these inspiring messages were transmitted to the suburbs, the broad masses of cadres and commune members immediately responded enthusiastically, expressing their determination to respond to the concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with practical actions.
    After the new Beijing Municipal Party Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of the 13th, many communes and teams immediately organized cadres and commune members to conduct discussions, and some even held oath-taking rallies. The broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, were eager to speak. They discussed class struggle and production struggle, and their words expressed their love for Chairman Mao. A poor peasant commune member from Huzhuang Brigade, Hanzhuang Commune, Pinggu County, said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee has defeated the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are still so concerned about our production. We must carry the Great Cultural Revolution through to the end and harvest the wheat well to repay the kindness of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee." The broad masses of cadres and commune members enthusiastically responded to the requirement of giving prominence to politics, as put forward by Comrade Wu De, Second Secretary of the new Municipal Party Committee, in his mobilization report at the telephone conference. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: The more acute the class struggle, the more important it is to give prominence to politics. The busier the "Three Summers" work, the more we must study Chairman Mao's works. We poor and lower-middle peasants must do a good job in the "Three Summers" while continuing to fire at the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs. Everyone believes that in the past, under the pernicious influence of the former Municipal Party Committee's revisionist line, some brigades did not put politics in command, but rather work points. Now, it is necessary to resolutely eliminate the pernicious influence of the former Municipal Party Committee and resolutely implement putting politics in command. When the Yanhe Brigade of Liqiao Commune in Shunyi County harvested wheat for the first day, commune members went to the fields with Chairman Mao's quotations boards and quotation books. Each team also set up a merit book to record good people and good deeds, and promptly broadcast them through the brigade's radio.
    During the summer harvest, the broad masses of cadres and commune members greatly promoted the revolutionary spirit. The Guangde Brigade of the Red Star Commune in Daxing County started harvesting wheat on the 15th. Commune members said: "Doing a good job in the summer harvest with practical actions is a powerful blow to anti-Party and anti-socialist elements." People got up early and finished late, and they also studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Combat Liberalism" during their rest. Due to the mobilization of the commune members' enthusiasm, they not only harvested quickly, but also harvested carefully.
    The work teams organized by the State Council and the new Municipal Party Committee have successively arrived in the communes and teams, and have been warmly welcomed by the local cadres and masses. Counties and districts have also organized forces to go to the countryside to help with the summer harvest. (Attached picture)
    Right picture: Commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, while helping the masses to rush to harvest wheat, also self-compiled and self-directed programs related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and went to the fields to carry out propaganda. The broad masses of commune members warmly stated: It is necessary to resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    京郊干部社员热烈欢迎国务院和北京新市委派来的工作队
    党中央和毛主席的关怀带来最大的鼓舞和力量
    广大干部社员决心把文化大革命进行到底，把麦子收好
    新华社十七日讯　党中央、毛主席十分关怀北京郊区的农业生产，决定由国务院、中共北京新市委组织工作队到北京市各县区帮助夏收工作。根据这个精神，中共北京新市委发出搞好“三夏”（夏收、夏种、夏锄）生产，争取文化革命和农业生产双丰收的号召。这些鼓舞人心的消息传到郊区以后，社队广大干部、社员立即热烈响应，纷纷表示要以实际行动，回答党中央和毛主席的关怀。
    中共北京新市委十三日晚上召开电话会议以后，许多社队立即组织干部、社员进行了讨论，有的还开了誓师大会。广大群众，特别是贫农下中农，争先发言。他们议阶级斗争，论生产斗争，千言万语，句句表达了对毛主席的热爱。平谷县韩庄公社胡庄大队一个贫农社员说：“毛主席和党中央领导的无产阶级文化大革命，打垮了前北京市委反党反社会主义的黑线。毛主席和党中央还这样关心咱们的生产。我们一定把文化大革命进行到底，把麦子收好，答谢毛主席和党中央的恩情。”广大干部、社员热烈响应新市委第二书记吴德同志在电话会议动员报告中提出的突出政治的要求，很多贫农下中农说：阶级斗争越尖锐，越要突出政治。“三夏”工作越忙，越得学习毛主席著作。咱们贫农下中农要一面搞好“三夏”，一面继续向反党反社会主义黑帮开火。大家认为，过去，在前市委修正主义路线的恶劣影响下，一些大队不是政治挂帅，而是工分挂帅。现在，必须坚决肃清前市委的恶劣影响，坚决实行政治挂帅。顺义县李桥公社沿河大队第一天收小麦，社员们下地时，带着毛主席语录牌、语录本，各队还设了功劳簿，记载好人好事，并及时通过大队广播。
    在夏收中，广大干部和社员，大大发扬了革命精神。大兴县红星公社广德大队，十五日开始割麦，社员们说：“以实际行动搞好夏收，就是对反党反社会主义分子的有力打击。”人们起得早，收工晚，休息时还学习了《愚公移山》、《反对自由主义》，由于调动了社员们的积极性，不只收得快，而且收得细。
    国务院、新市委组织的工作队，已经陆续到达社队，受到了当地干部群众的热烈欢迎。各县、区也纷纷组织力量，下乡帮助夏收。（附图片）
