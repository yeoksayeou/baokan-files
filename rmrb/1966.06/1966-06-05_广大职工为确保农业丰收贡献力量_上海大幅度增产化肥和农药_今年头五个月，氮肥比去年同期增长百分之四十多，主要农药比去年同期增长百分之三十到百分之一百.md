　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd -- Workers in Shanghai's fertilizer plants and pesticide plants are actively tapping production potential, greatly increasing the output of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and developing new varieties of pesticides. From January to May this year, nitrogen fertilizer increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year; major pesticides such as Dipterex, Rogor, BHC raw powder, and the antibacterial agent "401" increased by 30% to 100% compared with the same period last year.
　　The continuous development of agricultural production requires the development of more effective new varieties of pesticides. This year, the workers more consciously studied Chairman Mao's works, enhancing their determination and confidence to help farmers overcome nature. They recognized that in recent years, due to following Chairman Mao's instruction to take agriculture as the foundation, many varieties have been developed, contributing to ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. However, they must never be satisfied with the existing varieties. Stagnation in variety development is tantamount to surrendering to crop diseases and insect pests. Therefore, they pay closer attention to crop diseases and insect pests and try every possible means to trial-produce new pesticides with stronger pertinence. Hearing that some rice paddies had a blast disease, with the rice leaves turning white and gradually dying, and that other pesticides were not very effective, the workers of the Shanghai Pesticide Factory, with the assistance of the Shanghai Pesticide Research Institute, immediately improvised equipment and experimented with a new type of pesticide, "Daowenjing" (Rice Blast Control), and gave batches for trial use by the people's communes as they were produced. Workers and technicians from the United Chemical Plant and the Shanghai Pesticide Research Institute, in order to effectively kill snails that harm crops, trial-produced a "snail killer." They took samples to the fields and tried them out with the commune members. Snails have shells, and it is not easy to kill them by simply spraying medicine, so they tried to make the medicine have a fragrance that attracts snails to eat. After repeated experiments, a relatively satisfactory formula has been found, and the trial production is actively underway.
　　The workers are also speeding up the installation of equipment for new pesticides that have been successfully trial-produced in the past and putting them into production as soon as possible. At present, new pesticides that are being produced in batches include "Chlordane" and "Heptachlor" for killing underground pests such as cutworms and mole crickets, "Daojiaoqing" for specifically treating rice sheath blight, and the antibacterial agent "401," which was created in China to prevent potato black scurf.
　　The workers of the fertilizer factories, who "compete for every ounce" in production, this year further launched a large-scale technical innovation campaign, tapped the potential of equipment, and greatly increased the production of synthetic ammonia and nitrogen fertilizer. The large-scale Wu Jing Chemical Plant, newly built in China, has increased its ammonia production capacity by one time compared to the original design level due to continuous equipment and process reforms. The small fertilizer plants scattered in the suburbs, originally designed to produce 800 tons of ammonia per year, have now increased their production capacity to 3,000 tons of ammonia per year. In recent years, the workers of these small fertilizer plants have followed Chairman Mao's teaching of having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, and have continuously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution. Starting in the second half of last year, the workers of these small fertilizer plants further broke down superstitions and boldly reformed the synthesis tower, which was previously called the "tiger's ass." The relevant leading departments of the city transferred some experienced workers and technicians from various factories and concentrated them to fight a war of annihilation, reforming the plants one by one. At present, the production capacity of the synthesis towers reformed in some factories in Jiading, Pudong, Nanhui, and other places is generally 20% to 30% higher than the original design level.

### 广大职工为确保农业丰收贡献力量  上海大幅度增产化肥和农药  今年头五个月，氮肥比去年同期增长百分之四十多，主要农药比去年同期增长百分之三十到百分之一百

    广大职工为确保农业丰收贡献力量
    上海大幅度增产化肥和农药
    今年头五个月，氮肥比去年同期增长百分之四十多，主要农药比去年同期增长百分之三十到百分之一百
    新华社上海三日电　上海化肥厂和农药厂的职工积极挖掘生产潜力，大幅度增加化肥和农药的产量，发展农药新品种。今年一到五月份氮肥比去年同期增长百分之四十多；敌百虫、乐果、六六六原粉、抗菌剂“401”等主要农药，比去年同期增长百分之三十到百分之一百。
    农业生产不断地发展，要求农药发展更有效的新品种。今年，职工们更自觉地学习毛主席著作，提高了帮助农民战胜自然的决心和信心。他们认识到，几年来，由于遵照毛主席以农业为基础的指示，发展了不少品种，为确保农业丰收贡献了力量，但是，绝不能满足于已有的品种。在品种上停滞不前，就等于向农作物的病虫害认输。因此，他们更加密切关注农作物的病虫害，及时地千方百计地试制针对性更强的新农药。听说有的田里水稻有一种瘟病，稻叶发白并渐渐枯死，用别的农药效果都不大，上海农药厂的工人在上海农药研究所的协助下，立即因陋就简，拼凑设备，试验一种新型农药“稻瘟净”，试出一批，就交给人民公社试用一批。联合化工厂和上海农药研究所的工人、技术人员，为了有效地杀治危害农作物的蜗牛，试制出了一种“杀蜗牛剂”。他们带了样品到田头，和社员们一道亲手试用。蜗牛有壳，单纯喷撒药物，不容易杀治，他们就设法使药物具有引诱蜗牛来吃的香味。经过反复试验，目前已找到一种比较满意的配方，试制工作正在积极进行中。
    职工们还为过去试制成功的新农药尽速装置设备，及早投入生产。目前，成批生产的新农药有杀治地老虎、蝼蛄等地下害虫的“氯丹”和“七氯”，有专治水稻纹枯病的“稻脚青”和我国独创的防治马铃薯黑疽病的抗菌剂“401”等。
    在生产上“斤两必争”的化肥工厂职工们，今年更进一步大闹技术革新，挖掘设备潜力，大量增产合成氨、增产氮肥。我国新建的大型化肥厂——吴泾化工厂，由于不断改革设备、工艺，目前氨的生产能力已比原设计水平提高一倍。散布在郊区原设计为年产氨八百吨的小化肥厂，目前生产能力已提高到年产氨三千吨的水平。几年来，这些小化肥厂的职工遵照毛主席关于有所发现、有所发明、有所创造、有所前进的教导，不断开展技术革新和技术革命。从去年下半年开始，这些小化肥厂职工进一步大破迷信，大胆改革过去被称为“老虎屁股”的合成塔。市有关领导部门从各厂抽调了一些有经验的工人、技术人员，集中起来打歼灭仗，一个个厂地进行改革。目前，嘉定、浦东、南汇等一些厂经过改革的合成塔，生产能力一般都比原设计水平提高百分之二十到三十。
