    The directors of "Sailing Against the Wind" stand on the position of the overthrown reactionary class, trying their best to beautify and praise the "unyielding" counter-revolutionary spirit of the Kuomintang reactionaries, writing histories and biographies for a group of executioners with blood on their hands. In the directors' writings, the prisoners escorted by our army are all invariably so tenacious, calm, and composed, without the slightest fear.

    Chairman Mao taught us that all reactionaries are paper tigers. This is an irrefutable truth. All reactionaries are outwardly strong but inwardly weak in the face of the revolutionary people. This is determined by their reactionary nature of being divorced from the people and being greedy for life and afraid of death. During the Liberation War, our army captured tens of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's officers. These guys, who used to be domineering and imposing, once they were captured alive by us, whether they were "big officials" or "small officials," were all panic-stricken, begging for mercy. Take the enemy division commander Sun Zhenrong in the film "Sailing Against the Wind" as an example. Sun Zhenrong was actually Li Zhengyi, the division commander of the 25th Division (the so-called "Thousand Li Colt Division"), the main force of the Kuomintang, which was completely annihilated by our army in the Xin’anling battle in Northeast China in November 1946. What was Li Zhengyi's performance after being captured by our army? When he was dragged out of the prisoner group by our army, he was wearing a gray military uniform of a Kuomintang soldier, covered in mud and grease, scared out of his wits, trembling all over, his pockmarked face covered with sweat. His left leg was injured in the battle, and he limped when he walked. When he saw our soldiers, he bowed and asked us not to kill him. During the escort, in order to save his own life, he cursed Chiang Kai-shek in front of our soldiers, declaring that he did not want to fight a civil war. Other captured Kuomintang officers, like their superiors, said in a low voice, "We are guilty, we are guilty!" begging to save their lives.

    The film's depiction completely violates historical truth. Why did the directors reverse black and white, fabricate facts, and try their best to beautify the enemy army? Why did they throw out these counter-revolutionary "models" of "loyalty and devotion to the party and the country"? To put it bluntly, it is to "educate" the overthrown reactionary class in the country, to be like the counter-revolutionary "models" portrayed in the film, and to follow Chiang Kai-shek to the end in counter-revolution.

    The directors of the film insidiously issued a howl of "loyalty to the party and the country" to the overthrown reactionary class in the country, portrayed "models" of "loyalty to the party and the country," and at the same time, pointed out specific ways to "loyalty to the party and the country." This method is the spirit of resistance and sabotage against our army by the prisoners of war, which the film spares no effort to praise. In order to achieve this goal, the directors spared no effort to vilify our army, describing the detachment escorting the prisoners as weak and incompetent; on the other hand, they highlighted and exaggerated the rebellious spirit of the prisoners of war. They attempted to tell all the demons and monsters in the country that rebellion is possible, and the Communist Party is weak and can be bullied. This vicious intention of the directors runs through the entire film and becomes the soul of the film.

    The directors slandered that our army does not do political work at all: Instructor Song Zhigang is a political worker, but what about him? The soldiers do not understand the significance of escorting prisoners, and he does not do ideological work either. When he heard the news that our army had abandoned Fengcheng, he did not promptly mobilize the masses to find a solution, but was impatient, rude, and helpless. Our army in the directors' writings lacks a high degree of class consciousness: on the way to escort the prisoners, the soldiers look worried and listless, unable to see smiles, unable to hear songs, and unable to feel their high revolutionary optimism. They do not look like revolutionary soldiers at all, let alone revolutionary soldiers who have won a battle. When the detachment advanced towards the Shuanglong River Estuary, it was attacked from both sides by Kuomintang bandits. Everyone panicked and said, "It's too late," "It's terrible." Company Commander Hu was extremely irritable, and the veteran soldier Ji Pengfei even suggested shooting the prisoners. They fabricated that our army had no discipline or vigilance: soldier Ji Pengfei left his post without authorization while guarding the enemy division commander; the enemy special agent chief escaped and returned, but no one cared; the prisoners carried out conspiracies at will, but no one strictly stopped them. They distorted the flesh-and-blood relationship between our army and the masses of people: everywhere our army went, it was so deserted, without the enthusiastic help and strong support of the people, but instead allowed the "Anti-Communist Loyalty and National Salvation Army" elements to take advantage. They also slandered that our army had no way to deal with the prisoners of war's rebellion...

    These are all the directors' nonsense, all shameless fabrications with ulterior motives!

    In the war history of our army, there has never been a command, a troop escorting prisoners, a prisoner policy, or a mass of people like those depicted in the film "Sailing Against the Wind."

    The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is an invincible army. Chairman Mao had already made such an evaluation of our army's combat effectiveness in the article "On Coalition Government": "Judging from its combat effectiveness, judging from its having the broad masses of the people cooperate in the war, judging from its political quality and internal unity, it has already become the main force in China's War of Resistance Against Japan." After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our army became even stronger. In the Liberation War, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the cadres and soldiers had a high degree of class consciousness, had a deep hatred for the enemy, were extremely high in morale, were very closely united, had very active political work, and had forged a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses of the people. Wherever we went, we received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people. Therefore, our army was invincible in battle, and in a short period of more than three years, we eliminated more than eight million Chiang bandit troops, winning the victory of the Liberation War. The Xin'anling battle in Northeast China in November 1946, referred to in the film "Sailing Against the Wind," saw our army completely annihilate the enemy's main force, the 25th Division, in just over three days. When our detachment accepted the task of escorting prisoners, the superiors gave very clear instructions, explaining several plans for how to deal with different situations. At that time, the political work cadres who led the detachment to carry out the task did a very good job of political work. After accepting the task, they immediately made in-depth mobilizations, explained the significance of carrying out the escort of prisoners, envisioned the problems that might be encountered, and mobilized the soldiers to find ways to overcome difficulties. On the way to escort the prisoners, they also did a lot of political and ideological work in a timely manner, depending on the different situations and problems. The soldiers had just won a battle and were in extremely high spirits. On the way to escort the prisoners, they talked and laughed, sang constantly, held their heads high, and strode forward. They had a clear understanding of the task, carried out the task very seriously, strictly implemented the prisoner policy, and treated the prisoners with extreme seriousness. The prisoners were despondent, greedy for life and afraid of death. Under the escort of our army, they obediently walked hundreds of kilometers and arrived at their destination. The mass conditions at that time were also very favorable to our army. After Chairman Mao issued the "Establish Consolidated Northeast Base Areas" instruction in December 1945, our Party, government, and army did a lot of in-depth mass work, and the people enthusiastically supported our army. In every battle against the enemy, the people actively led the way for our army, sent intelligence, transported ammunition, carried stretchers, and solved the problems of food and housing... The people hated the enemy intensely and used various methods to strike at the enemy, causing great difficulties to the enemy army. On the way our detachment escorted the prisoners, at the earnest request of the local government and mass organizations, several victory celebration meetings were held. The people were elated, shouting "Down with Chiang Kai-shek, liberate all of China!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" When the people saw the prisoners, they were filled with indignation and could not help but want to kill this group of national scum. Because our army implemented a policy of leniency towards prisoners of war and did a lot of explanatory work to the people, the prisoners were able to keep their heads.

    The iron facts completely expose the directors' shameless lies!

    The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is the pillar of our great motherland. Therefore, all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements always harbor a deep hatred for our army. The directors of the film "Sailing Against the Wind" are precisely writing about our army with such vicious hatred. The directors felt that their individual strength was insufficient, so they attempted to use the broken loudspeaker of "Sailing Against the Wind" to "mobilize" more people to rebel with them. Isn't the directors' intention to encourage counter-revolutionary elements to rise up and carry out restoration self-evident?

    The directors of the film also sought to reassure counter-revolutionary elements at home and encourage them to place their hopes on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and be prepared to rebel at any time, so as to cooperate from within and without one day to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration, by promoting the care and concern of the Kuomintang reactionaries' chiefs for the captured personnel, their intentions are truly evil and poisonous!

    The directors proved to people that when the bandit army commander learned that his subordinate Sun Zhenrong had been captured by our army and was being escorted to Fengcheng, he was so anxious that he was on pins and needles. He immediately sent cavalry to follow and investigate; he also sent special agent chief Yang Ziming to risk his life, disguised as a straggling soldier of our army to infiltrate our interior, and colluded with Sun Zhenrong and others to carry out cooperation from within and without. Look, what meticulous care, what "heart-warming" feelings of a superior "caring for and loving" his subordinates! This is completely nonsense!

    The Kuomintang army was an army with class oppression and class antagonism. Officers oppressed soldiers, superiors bullied subordinates. The relationship between senior generals was also full of infighting and deceit. Take the division commander and deputy division commander of the film "Sailing Against the Wind" as an example. The actual situation at that time was: the enemy division commander saw that the entire army had been defeated by us, felt that the situation was bad, and immediately escaped by car (he was captured alive by us before he could run far), even abandoning the deputy division commander. The deputy division commander led the defeated soldiers and retreated, and when he saw that the division commander had escaped first, he burst into cursing. What kind of feelings were there between them, what kind of meticulous care was there?

    The directors reversed black and white and talked nonsense, and their sinister purpose was to give all counter-revolutionary elements in the country a "reassurance pill" to encourage them to be counter-revolutionary to the end.

    Chairman Mao taught us: Never forget class struggle! For more than sixteen years since the founding of New China, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements have not been reconciled to failure and have always conspired to overthrow our great People's Republic. The directors of the film "Sailing Against the Wind" are standing on the counter-revolutionary position and launching a frantic attack on the Party and socialism. We must smash this broken loudspeaker that promotes counter-revolutionary elements to rebel and eliminate all pests!

    The directors of the film, we warn you: your vicious intentions to promote counter-revolutionary elements to rebel will never succeed. Our great motherland is very consolidated under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is invincible in the world. We have the magic weapon of people's war, and no enemy can do anything to us. All commanders and fighters of our People's Liberation Army resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements: "Only allow them to be well-behaved, and do not allow them to talk nonsense or act recklessly." All counter-revolutionary elements have no way out except to honestly surrender to the people, reform themselves, repent, and start anew. Anyone who wants to rebel will only bring about their own destruction. The directors of "Sailing Against the Wind" vainly attempt to promote counter-revolutionary elements to rise up and rebel, you can only end up with your heads broken and bloodied!

    砸碎煽动反革命分子造反的破喇叭
    卢健中　余培明
    《逆风千里》的编导者站在被推翻了的反动阶级的立场上，竭力美化和歌颂国民党反动派“坚贞不屈”的反革命精神，为一群双手沾满劳动人民鲜血的刽子手写史立传。在编导者的笔下，被我军押解的俘虏，无一例外都是那么顽强、沉着、镇定，没有半点惧色。
    毛主席教导我们，一切反动派都是纸老虎。这是颠扑不破的真理。一切反动派在革命人民的面前，都是色厉内荏、十分虚弱的，这是他们脱离人民、贪生怕死的反动本质所决定的。解放战争时期，我军俘虏过成千上万的蒋匪军官。这些过去作威作福、威风凛凛的家伙，一经被我生擒活捉，不论是“大官”，还是“小官”，无一不是惊惶失色、告饶求命的。就拿影片《逆风千里》中的敌师长孙振戎来说吧。孙振戎实际上是一九四六年十一月，被我军在东北新开岭战斗中全歼的国民党主力二十五师（所谓“千里驹师”）的师长李正谊。李正谊被我军俘虏后的表现是怎样的呢？他被我军从俘虏群中揪出来时，穿一身沾满泥土和油渍的国民党士兵的灰军衣，吓得面无人色，浑身直哆嗦，麻脸上尽是汗水，左腿在战斗中被打伤了，走路一瘸一拐地。他见到我军战士就鞠躬，请求我们不要杀他。在押解途中，他为了保全自己的生命，当着我军战士的面，破口大骂蒋介石，表白他不想打内战。其他被俘的国民党军官，也同他们的上司一样，低声下气地连连说：“我们有罪，我们有罪！”请求保住他们的一条命。
    影片的描写完全违背了历史的真实。编导者为什么要颠倒黑白、捏造事实，尽力美化敌军？为什么要抛出这些“忠贞不二”、“效忠党国”的反革命“样板”呢？戳穿说，就是为了“教育”国内被推翻了的反动阶级，要象影片所刻划的那些反革命“样板”一样，死心塌地地跟着蒋介石反革命到底。
    影片编导者阴险地向国内被推翻了的反动阶级发出了“效忠党国”的嚎叫，刻划了“效忠党国”的“样板”，同时，又给他们指出了“效忠党国”的具体办法。这个办法就是影片不遗余力地歌颂的战俘对我军的反抗、捣乱精神。为了达到这个目的，编导者一方面竭力丑化我军，把我押送俘虏的分队描写得软弱无能；一方面突出渲染战俘的反叛精神。企图以此告诉国内的一切牛鬼蛇神：造反是可以的，共产党是软弱可欺的。编导者这一恶毒的用心，贯串在整部影片中，成为这部影片的灵魂。
    编导者污蔑我军根本不做政治工作：指导员宋志刚身为政治工作人员，但他怎么样呢？战士们不懂得押送俘虏的意义，他也不做思想工作。听到我军放弃奉城的消息，他不及时发动群众想办法，而是焦躁粗暴，束手无策。编导者笔下的我军，是没有高度阶级觉悟的：在押送俘虏路途中，战士们愁眉苦脸，无精打彩，看不到欢笑，听不见歌声，感觉不到他们高昂的革命乐观主义精神，根本不象革命战士的样子，更不象打了胜仗的革命战士的样子。小分队朝双龙江口行进时，遭到国民党匪军两头夹攻，大家慌成一团，说什么“晚了”，“糟了”，胡排长烦躁不堪，老战士纪鹏飞竟提出要枪毙俘虏。他们捏造我军没有纪律和警惕性：战士纪鹏飞看守敌师长竟擅离岗位；敌特工处长逃出去、打进来竟没有人过问，俘虏随心所欲地进行阴谋活动竟没有人严厉制止。他们歪曲我军与人民群众血肉相连的关系：我军所到之处，都是那么冷冷清清，没有人民群众的热情帮助和大力支援，反而让“反共忠义救国军”分子钻了空子。他们还污蔑我军对战俘的反叛毫无办法……。
    这些，都是编导者的胡言乱语，都是别有用心的无耻捏造！
    在我军的战争史上，根本没有象影片《逆风千里》所描绘的那样的指挥、那样押送俘虏的部队、那样的俘虏政策、那样的人民群众。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是一支战无不胜、攻无不克的军队。对我军战斗力，毛主席在《论联合政府》一文中，早已作过这样的评价：“按其战斗力说来，按其有广大的人民配合作战说来，按其政治质量及其内部统一团结等项情况说来，它已经成了中国抗日战争的主力军。”抗日战争胜利以后，我军更加强大。在解放战争中，我军有党和毛主席的英明领导，干部战士有高度的阶级觉悟，对敌人怀着深刻的仇恨，斗志十分高昂，团结十分紧密，政治工作十分活跃，又和人民群众结成了血肉情谊，所到之处，无不受到广大人民的热烈支援。因此，我军在战斗中，所向披靡，以秋风扫落叶之势，在短短的三年多时间，就消灭了蒋匪军八百多万，取得了解放战争的胜利。影片《逆风千里》所指的一九四六年十一月东北新开岭战斗，我军三天多就全歼了敌主力二十五师。我小分队接受押送俘虏任务时，上级指示十分明确，交代了在不同情况下如何处置的几套方案。当时领导小分队执行任务的政治工作干部，政治工作做得很好，接受任务后，立即做了深入动员，讲清了执行押送俘虏的意义，设想了可能遇到的问题，发动战士想办法克服困难。押送俘虏途中，又针对不同情况和问题，及时做了许多政治思想工作。战士们刚打了胜仗，情绪极为高昂，在押送俘虏途中，有说有笑，歌声不断，昂首挺胸，阔步前进。他们对任务有明确的了解，执行任务十分认真，严格执行了俘虏政策，对待俘虏的态度极端严肃。俘虏们丧魂落魄，贪生怕死，在我军押送下，乖乖地走了几百公里，到达了目的地。当时的群众条件，对我军也十分有利。一九四五年十二月，毛主席发出《建立巩固的东北根据地》的指示后，我党、政、军做了大量深入的群众工作，人民群众对我军热烈拥护。每次对敌作战中，人民群众都积极给我军带路，送情报，运弹药，抬担架，解决吃和住的问题……。人民对敌人则是万分仇恨，用种种办法打击敌人，使敌军遭到极大的困难。我小分队押送俘虏途中，在地方政府和群众团体的殷切要求下，开了几次祝捷大会，人民群众兴高采烈，高呼“打倒蒋该死，解放全中国！”“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”人民群众见到俘虏，气愤填膺，情不自禁要杀死这群民族败类。由于我军执行了宽待俘虏的政策，向人民群众做了许多解释工作，俘虏才保住了他们的脑袋。
    铁的事实，完全戳穿了编导者的无耻谰言！
    伟大的中国人民解放军是我们伟大祖国的支柱。因此，一切反党反社会主义分子，总是对我们的军队怀着刻骨的仇恨。影片《逆风千里》的编导者正是怀着这样恶毒的仇恨来描写我们军队的。编导者感到自己单枪匹马力量不足，就企图通过《逆风千里》这个破喇叭来“动员”更多的人跟他们一起造反。编导者鼓励反革命分子起来搞复辟的用意，不是昭然若揭了吗？
    影片的编导者还通过宣扬国民党反动派头目对被俘人员的关怀和惦念，来安抚国内反革命分子，鼓励他们要对蒋介石匪帮寄予希望，时刻准备造反，以便有朝一日里应外合，推翻共产党领导，实行反革命复辟，其用心真是至恶至毒！
    编导者向人们证明：匪军长得知其部属孙振戎被我军俘获押往奉城时，焦急得如坐针毡，立即派出骑兵跟踪追察；还派特工处长杨子鸣冒着生命危险，化装成我军掉队战士打入我内部，与孙振戎等一同搞里应外合。看，这是多么无微不至的关怀，多么“感动人心”的上级“关怀爱护”下级的感情！这完全是一派胡说！
    国民党军队是一支存在着阶级压迫和阶级对立的军队。长官压迫士兵，上级欺压下级。高级将领之间的关系也是勾心斗角，尔虞我诈。就拿影片《逆风千里》的正副师长来说吧，当时的实际情况是：敌师长见全军被我打垮，感到大势不好，立即乘车逃跑（没跑多远，被我生擒），连副师长也不要了。副师长带着溃兵败下阵来，见师长先逃了，就破口大骂起来。他们之间，那里有什么感情可言，那里有什么无微不至的关怀？
    编导者颠倒黑白地胡说一通，其阴险目的，就是给国内一切反革命分子吃上一颗“定心丸”，要他们反革命到底。
    毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争！新中国成立十六年多以来，一小撮反党反社会主义分子并不甘心失败，总是阴谋推翻我们伟大的人民共和国。影片《逆风千里》的编导者，就是站在反革命的立场上，向党向社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。我们必须砸碎这个鼓吹反革命分子造反的破喇叭，消灭一切害人虫！
    影片的编导者，我们警告你们：你们鼓吹反革命分子造反的恶毒用心是绝对不能得逞的。我们伟大的祖国，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，十分巩固。伟大的中国人民解放军，是天下无敌的。我们有人民战争这个法宝，任何敌人也奈何不得。我们人民解放军全体指战员，对待反革命分子，坚决按照毛主席的教导：“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。”一切反革命分子只有老老实实向人民投降，改恶从善，悔过自新，才有出路。谁要造反，就会自取灭亡。《逆风千里》的编导者妄想鼓吹反革命分子起来造反，你们只能得到碰得头破血流的下场！
