    Expressing Infinite Love for the Chinese People and Their Great Leader Comrade Mao Zedong
    阿報 (Albanian Newspaper) Enthusiastically Reports the Grand Occasion of the People of Tirana, Filled with Revolutionary Fervor, Welcoming Our Party and Government Delegation
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 25th – Albanian newspapers on the 25th, with extensive coverage, enthusiastically reported the grand reception and warm welcome received by the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai upon arriving in Tirana.
    《人民之声报》(The Voice of the People) and 《团结报》(Unity) each devoted three pages to reporting the arrival of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation and other related news.
    《人民之声报》(The Voice of the People), under the large, all-page headline "Unprecedented Grand and Solemn Welcome in Tirana for Comrade Zhou Enlai," published a lengthy report by its reporter. The author, using fervent language, reported on the grand occasion of the entire population of Tirana lining the streets to welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai. The reporter wrote in the report: "The welcome received by Zhou Enlai and the Chinese Party and Government Delegation he led is extraordinary and indescribable."
    The report said that Tirana and the entire Albania had never before welcomed a foreign delegation so warmly, so enthusiastically, and so grandly. The entire capital, men, women, old, and young, expressed their common feelings to the distinguished guests, to the great nation that is the bulwark of world revolution and socialism, to the staunch standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism – the great Chinese Communist Party, and to their great leader Comrade Mao Zedong – whose thought has revolutionized the thinking and face of China's 700 million people.
    "Yesterday's enthusiastic scene of welcoming Comrade Zhou Enlai and other distinguished guests from fraternal China will forever remain in the memory of the residents of the capital. Such a welcome is a shining manifestation of our eternal friendship with China and its glorious Chinese Communist Party; a shining manifestation of the revolutionary upsurge triggered by the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party, a historically significant year, and the Party's open letter; a shining manifestation of the enthusiasm aroused by the visit of our Party and Government Delegation to China and the welcome it received, as well as the Albania-China Joint Statement; a shining manifestation of the love and respect of our people for the great Chinese people."
    《团结报》(Unity), under the eye-catching headline "Our People Open Their Arms and Welcome the Distinguished Chinese Guests with Revolutionary Enthusiasm, Grandly and Solemnly" prominently published on the front page a report by its reporter, detailing the moving scene of Comrade Zhou Enlai's arrival in Tirana being greeted with an unprecedented grand and enthusiastic welcome along the streets. The reporter wrote: "The warm and grand welcome to the Chinese Party and Government Delegation is a manifestation of the friendship that links our two parties, two countries, and two peoples. It expresses the boundless love of our people for the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, for the great and talented Chinese people, and for the greatest, most sincere, and closest friends in the common struggle for socialism and communism, for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, against imperialism headed by the United States, and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leadership group."
    The 《青年之声报》(Voice of Youth), published on the 25th, published an editorial titled "Paying Revolutionary Respects to Respected Friends," saying: "Our people and youth regard Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit as another manifestation of the profound, fraternal, and unbreakable combat friendship between our two peoples and two parties." "Comrade Zhou Enlai, your visit, like your previous two visits to our country, will surely further strengthen the unbreakable revolutionary friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples."
    The editorial also warmly praised China's vigorously developing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The editorial said, "The cultural revolution that the Chinese people are carrying out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the struggle of the Chinese people to eradicate bourgeois and feudal ideology and to consolidate the position of proletarian ideology, is a great contribution of the Chinese people in the struggle for the complete victory of the socialist revolution and the thorough smashing of imperialism and revisionism."

    向中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志表达无限热爱之情
    阿报刊热情报道地拉那人民满怀革命情谊倾城欢迎我党政代表团盛况
    新华社地拉那二十五日电  阿尔巴尼亚各报二十五日以大量篇幅，热情报道由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团到达地拉那，受到隆重接待和热烈欢迎的盛况。
    《人民之声报》和《团结报》各以三个版的篇幅，报道了中国党政代表团抵达和其他有关消息。
    《人民之声报》在《地拉那空前盛大隆重欢迎周恩来同志》的横贯全版的大字标题下，刊登了该报记者写的一篇长篇报道。作者用火热的语言，报道了地拉那全城居民夹道欢迎周恩来同志的盛况。记者在报道中写道：“周恩来和由他率领的中国党政代表团所受到的欢迎是不同寻常的、是难以用言语来表达的。”
    报道说，地拉那和整个阿尔巴尼亚从来没有这样热烈、这样热情、这样盛大地欢迎过外国代表团。整个首都的男女老幼向贵宾们，向世界革命和社会主义堡垒的伟大国家，向马克思列宁主义坚定的旗手——伟大的中国共产党，向他们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志——他的思想使中国七亿人民的思想和面貌实现了革命化——表达了他们的共同的感情。
    “昨天欢迎周恩来同志和来自兄弟中国的其他贵宾的热烈场面将永远留在首都居民的记忆中，这样的欢迎是我们对中国及其光荣的中国共产党的永恒友情的光辉表现；是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立二十五周年这一具有历史意义的一年和党的公开信所掀起的革命高潮的光辉表现；是我国党政代表团在中国的访问和受到的欢迎，以及阿尔巴尼亚中国联合声明所激起的热情的光辉表现；是我国人民对伟大的中国人民热爱和尊敬的光辉表现。”
    《团结报》在《我国人民张开双臂，满怀革命热情地、盛大隆重地欢迎中国贵宾》的通栏醒目标题下，在头版头条地位刊登了该报记者的一篇报道，详细描写周恩来同志到达地拉那受到空前盛大、热烈的夹道欢迎的动人情景。记者写道：“对中国党政代表团热烈、盛大的欢迎，是联系我们两党、两国和两国人民的友谊的表现。它表达了我国人民对以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，对伟大和天才的中国人民，对在争取社会主义和共产主义、争取马克思列宁主义的胜利、反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争中最伟大、最真诚和最亲密的朋友所怀有的无限热爱。”
    二十五日出版的《青年之声报》以《向尊敬的朋友致以革命的敬礼》为题发表社论说：“我国人民和青年，把周恩来同志的访问看作是我们两国人民和两党之间深厚的、兄弟般的、牢不可破的战斗友谊的又一表现。”“周恩来同志，您的访问将象您在我国的前两次访问一样，必将更加加强阿中两国人民牢不可破的革命友谊。”
    社论还热烈赞扬了正在蓬勃开展的中国的无产阶级文化大革命。社论说，“中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下正在进行的文化大革命、中国人民为铲除资产阶级和封建主义思想和为巩固无产阶级思想阵地所进行的斗争，是中国人民在争取社会主义革命的完全胜利、彻底粉碎帝国主义和修正主义斗争中的伟大贡献。”（附图片）
