    To the esteemed Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:
    We, more than 800 teachers and students of Peking University, were on the train returning to school from the front line of the rural class struggle when we heard the news about the big-character poster put up by Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others from the Department of Philosophy. Everyone was filled with indignation, expressing boundless hatred for the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies of the likes of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun. We immediately plunged into battle, writing letters of determination, holding discussion meetings, and studying Chairman Mao's works. Using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we launched verbal and written attacks, severely condemning and denouncing the counter-revolutionary actions of Song Shuo, Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk. The entire train transformed into a fiery battlefield of the socialist cultural revolution.
    For the past six months, while fighting alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, we deeply experienced that the poor and lower-middle peasants have the firmest stance and the clearest distinction between love and hate. They have boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and boundless faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to take the poor and lower-middle peasants as our role models, and with strong class feelings, plunge into this life-and-death great revolution, sweeping away all monsters and demons.
    Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun, and their ilk, having long controlled the leadership of Peking University, have consistently resisted Mao Zedong Thought, resisted the Party's guidelines and policies, suppressed our revolutionary demands, and turned Peking University into a revisionist stronghold. We have deeply felt this in our years of study and work at Peking University. They are resolutely hostile to the people, engaging in clandestine activities, and until recently, they still stubbornly resisted, attempting to reverse the wheels of history, employing deceptive, obfuscating, suppressive, and threatening means to prevent us from rising up in revolution. No! This is impossible, a thousand times, ten thousand times impossible!
    Here, on the speeding train, we would like to assure the esteemed Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: We will resolutely respond to your call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely destroy the strongholds of the "Three-Family Village," uproot them completely, and thoroughly overthrow them!
    We swear to you that we must stand at the forefront of the great revolutionary movement, resolutely seize back the leadership of Peking University from the hands of the black gang elements, and fight to the end to quickly build a thriving, truly socialist New Peking University! We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.
    Swear to defend the Party Central Committee!
    Defend Mao Zedong Thought!
    Defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!
    The entire faculty, staff, and students of Peking University participating in the Socialist Education Movement in Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan offer this on the train, June 2, 1966.

    北大参加农村社会主义教育运动师生在返校途中
    致电党中央和毛主席
    表示决心建设一个真正的社会主义的新北大
    敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们八百多名北大师生，从农村阶级斗争前线返校的途中，在列车上听到了哲学系聂元梓等同志贴大字报的消息后，个个义愤填膺，对宋硕、陆平、彭珮云之流反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，表示无比的愤恨。我们立即投入战斗，写决心书，开讨论会，学习毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，口诛笔伐，严厉斥责和声讨宋硕、陆平、彭珮云之流的反革命行径，整个列车变成了社会主义文化大革命的火热战场。
    半年来，在和贫下中农共同战斗的日子里，我们深深体验到贫下中农立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，他们对党对毛主席无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想无限信仰。我们决心以贫下中农为榜样，带着强烈的阶级感情，投入这场你死我活的大革命，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    陆平、彭珮云之流，长期把持北大的领导权，一直对抗毛泽东思想，抵制党的方针政策，压制我们的革命要求，把北大变成了修正主义堡垒。对这一点，我们在北大几年的学习和工作中，是深有体会的。他们坚决与人民为敌，进行不可告人的勾当，直到最近仍然负隅抵抗，企图倒转历史车轮，采用欺骗蒙蔽、压制威胁手段，不许我们起来革命。不！这办不到，一千个、一万个办不到！
    在这里，在疾驶的列车上，我们谨向敬爱的党中央和毛主席保证：我们坚决响应您的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决摧毁“三家村”据点，把它们连根拔掉，彻底打倒！
    我们向您宣誓，我们一定要站在伟大革命运动最前列，坚决从黑帮分子手中夺回北大领导权，为迅速建设一个欣欣向荣的真正的社会主义的新北大而奋斗到底！不获全胜，决不收兵。
    誓死保卫党中央！
    保卫毛泽东思想！
    保卫无产阶级专政！北京大学参加四川乐山专区社会
  主义教育运动的全体师生员工敬上一九六六年六月二日于列车上
