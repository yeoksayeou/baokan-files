    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, of great historical significance, is entering a magnificent climax under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the active participation of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the vast numbers of revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. The Seventh "Shanghai Spring" music festival, held amidst this high tide of the Cultural Revolution, has successfully concluded. This "Shanghai Spring" fully demonstrated the great power of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, embodied the magnificent momentum of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and brought into play the role of the worker, peasant, and soldier masses as the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
    The biggest characteristic of the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" is that it held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The more than two hundred programs performed at this music festival were filled with soaring revolutionary spirit and the militant atmosphere of the proletariat. The red thread of the great Mao Zedong Thought ran through all the programs: resolutely defending Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically praising Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought. It is a product of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and a paean to the great Mao Zedong Thought.
      "What class speaks for what class." The worker, peasant, and soldier masses and revolutionary literary and art workers who participated in the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" firmly stood on the proletariat's position and sang a "rival opera" against the demons and monsters in literary and art circles. While the demons and monsters frantically attacked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the "Shanghai Spring" wholeheartedly praised the Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao; while the demons and monsters desperately slandered socialism, the "Shanghai Spring" enthusiastically praised socialism; while the demons and monsters used emperors, kings, generals, prime ministers, talented scholars, and beautiful ladies to dominate the artistic stage, excluding the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the "Shanghai Spring" wholeheartedly sang the praises of worker, peasant, and soldier heroes; while the demons and monsters promoted "deviation from the classics and rebellion against orthodoxy," the "Shanghai Spring" enthusiastically promoted and sang the "classics" of Mao Zedong Thought and the "way" of people's revolutionary war. The performers of "Shanghai Spring" said it well: Every song we sing, every dance step we take, is a bullet firing at the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs! The holding of the Seventh "Shanghai Spring" was a major counterattack by the revolutionary people against the anti-Party and anti-socialist literary and art black line.
    Chairman Mao pointed out at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: Our literature and art "are first of all for the workers, peasants and soldiers, are created for them and are utilized by them." This "Shanghai Spring" was held precisely by following Chairman Mao's teaching. People can see that the worker, peasant, and soldier masses have ascended the artistic stage of music and dance, participating in a series of activities such as creation, performance, and commentary. Most of the programs in the opening performance were works created by the worker, peasant, and soldier masses themselves. Many programs, from content to form, embodied the spirit of the Cultural Revolution, posing a powerful challenge to bourgeois music and dance "authorities" and "experts." This fact shows far more than just that workers, peasants, and soldiers can sing a few songs and dance a few dances; it illustrates a question of far-reaching significance: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken up the powerful weapon of music and dance and plunged into a battle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie in the cultural sphere, expanding the socialist cultural front. This marks the worker, peasant, and soldier masses as the powerful main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and as the masters of culture. At the same time, Shanghai's music and dance workers actively participated in this "Shanghai Spring" together with the worker, peasant, and soldier masses. They performed programs that promoted Mao Zedong Thought, praised worker, peasant, and soldier heroes, and were loved by the worker, peasant, and soldier masses; and they sent the programs to factories, villages, and troops to perform, receiving a warm welcome from the worker, peasant, and soldier masses. This is the result of their emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works creatively, and going among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their experience proves that only by firmly listening to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's direction on literature and art, striving to integrate with the worker, peasant, and soldier masses, and truly shifting their foothold to the side of the proletariat can revolutionary literary and art workers make beneficial contributions to the socialist literary and art cause.
    Shanghai is a city with millions of industrial workers and a glorious revolutionary tradition. The revolutionary people of Shanghai, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and played a pioneering role in the country. Their revolutionary spirit is worth learning from all over the country.

    无产阶级文化大革命的灿烂春光
    ——祝第七届“上海之春”胜利闭幕
    具有伟大历史意义的无产阶级文化大革命，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在广大工农兵群众、广大革命干部和革命知识分子的积极参加下，正进入一个波澜壮阔的高潮。在这个文化大革命高潮中举行的第七届“上海之春”音乐会，胜利闭幕了。这一届“上海之春”，充分地显示了毛泽东文艺思想的伟大力量，体现了无产阶级文化大革命的磅礴气势，发挥了工农兵群众在无产阶级文化大革命中的主力军作用。
    第七届“上海之春”的最大特点，就是它高高地举起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。这届音乐会演出的二百多个节目，洋溢着昂扬的革命精神，充满了无产阶级的战斗气息。在全部节目里，都贯穿着伟大毛泽东思想的红线：坚决捍卫毛泽东思想，热情歌颂毛泽东思想，大力宣传毛泽东思想。它是伟大毛泽东思想的产物，又是伟大毛泽东思想的颂歌。
      “什么阶级说什么话。”参加第七届“上海之春”演出的工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者，坚定地站在无产阶级的立场上，同文艺界的牛鬼蛇神大唱“对台戏”。牛鬼蛇神疯狂地攻击共产党和毛主席，“上海之春”则尽情地歌颂共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席；牛鬼蛇神竭力诽谤社会主义，“上海之春”则热烈赞美社会主义；牛鬼蛇神用帝王将相、才子佳人统治艺术舞台，排斥工农兵英雄形象，“上海之春”则尽情地歌颂工农兵英雄人物；牛鬼蛇神宣扬什么“离经叛道”，“上海之春”则热情地宣传和歌颂毛泽东思想之“经”、人民革命战争之“道”。“上海之春”的演出者们说得好：我们的每一句歌声，每一个舞步，都是向反党反社会主义黑帮开火的子弹！第七届“上海之春”的举行，是革命人民对反党反社会主义的文艺黑线的一次大反攻。
    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上指出：我们的文学艺术“首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这一届“上海之春”，正是遵循毛主席这一教导而举行的。人们可以看到，工农兵群众登上了音乐舞蹈的艺术舞台，参加了创作、演出和评论等一系列活动。在开幕演出的节目中，大部分是工农兵群众自己创作的作品。许多节目，从内容到形式，都体现了文化大革命的精神，向资产阶级音乐舞蹈“权威”、“专家”提出了强有力的挑战。这个事实，决不止是说明工农兵会唱几首歌，会跳几个舞，而是说明一个有深远意义的问题：广大工农兵拿起了音乐舞蹈这一有力的武器，投入了文化领域的一场兴无灭资的战斗，扩大了社会主义的文化阵地。这标志着工农兵群众是无产阶级文化大革命的强大主力军，是文化的主人。与此同时，上海的音乐舞蹈工作者，同工农兵群众一道积极参加了这届“上海之春”，他们演出了宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵英雄，为工农兵所喜闻乐见的节目；并且把节目送到工厂、农村、部队中去演出，受到工农兵热烈欢迎。这是他们突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作、深入工农兵以后取得的成果。他们的经验证明，革命的文艺工作者只有坚决听毛主席的话，坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方向，努力同工农兵群众相结合，真正把立足点转移到无产阶级方面来，才能为社会主义文艺事业作出有益的贡献。
    上海是一个拥有百万产业工人的城市，富有光荣的革命传统。上海的革命人民，在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在全国起了先锋的作用。他们的革命精神是值得全国各地学习的。
    第七届“上海之春”，不仅放射出上海的无产阶级文化大革命的灿烂春光，而且生动地反映了我国无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃的革命形势。目前，全国广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，用毛泽东思想作武器，正以雷霆万钧之势，横扫盘踞在思想文化阵地上的牛鬼蛇神。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
