    Seize the Hegemony of "Authority," Overthrow the Arrogance of "Authority"
    Chen Yonggui, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Party Branch Secretary of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County
    Editor's Note: Comrade Chen Yonggui's article is powerfully written. Combining his own personal experience and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, he thoroughly refutes the so-called "authority."
    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution seeks to sweep away all bourgeois "authorities" who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Chen Yonggui says: The "authority" of the bourgeoisie is the "right" to exploit the working people and the "power" to oppress the working people. To overthrow the "authority" of the bourgeoisie means to thoroughly seize the "power" of the bourgeoisie in the cultural sphere, to completely destroy the "power" of the bourgeoisie, and to thoroughly liberate the working people from the influence of all kinds of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.
    Comrade Chen Yonggui says it well: "Bourgeois 'authority' gentlemen! Let me tell you: The real 'authority' is not you, but we workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought." As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we can "grasp the truth and be invincible," trampling all bourgeois "authorities" who are anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought under our feet and firmly establish the authority of the proletariat!
    The bourgeois "authority" scolds us workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization," "simplification," and "pragmatism." This is utter nonsense, more stinking than dog farts. When a poisonous snake raises its head, it must be struck; if not struck, it will harm people. We must take up the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, take up hammers, iron bars, hoes, and carrying poles, and strike down all these poisonous snakes, sweeping them away!
    The era of bourgeois "authority" ruling and deceiving the people is over; the era of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory has begun.
    Certain so-called "authorities" constantly refer to themselves as "authorities" and "scholars," saying that workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works is "vulgarization" or "simplification." Let me tell you, bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! What "right" do you have? What "power" do you have?
    In the old society, we saw too much of the so-called "authority." Their "right" was the right to suppress the people, the right to rule the people; their "power" was to "beat the beggars, scold the poor, and look down on us workers, peasants, and soldiers." Their "right" was "hegemony," hegemonizing rivers, hegemonizing land, hegemonizing mountains, hegemonizing people; their "power" was the "arrogance" of bullying the poor, beating the poor, scolding the poor, drinking the blood of the poor, and eating the flesh of the poor. Now, you "authority" gentlemen, wearing the cloak of revolution, waving the banner of the Communist Party, living a socialist life, are engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, racking your brains for imperialism and revisionism. You flaunt your power, bullying others with the "rights" given to you by the Party and the people.
    In our Dazhai, before liberation, there were also landlord and rich peasant "authorities." In addition to economically exploiting and oppressing the poor and lower-middle peasants, they also used some theoretical "authority" to mislead and deceive us. For example, saying things like "The population of Dazhai cannot exceed three hundred, or trouble will ensue," or "Walnut trees take eighteen years to bear fruit, and planting walnut trees will lead to death." At that time, some people were deceived. The elderly were unwilling to plant walnut trees, fearing they wouldn't live to eat the nuts; the young were afraid to plant walnut trees, fearing they would die. In fact, those were all tricks by the landlords and rich peasants to rule and fool the peasants. After liberation, we had Mao Zedong Thought, and the "theories" of the landlords and rich peasants could no longer rule us. Now, the population of Dazhai has increased to three hundred and seventy, with both people and wealth flourishing. The walnut trees we planted bear fruit in the second year! Let me tell you, bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Although your tricks are a little more sophisticated than those of the landlords and rich peasants in the past, the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought carry a "demon-revealing mirror" with them. No matter what tricks you play, they will expose your true forms.
    The great Mao Zedong era is an era of the working people rising up to make revolution, an era of insisting on carrying the socialist revolution through to the end on the political, economic, and ideological-cultural fronts. The working people must have sharp weapons to thoroughly revolutionize and liberate themselves. This weapon is none other than Mao Zedong Thought. To smash the bourgeois "authority's" monopoly on philosophical theory, we workers, peasants, and soldiers must rise up to master Chairman Mao's philosophical theory. This is a life-and-death class struggle we are waging against the bourgeoisie. The wise and great Chairman Mao foresaw this inevitable struggle before the national liberation. He said: "After the enemy with guns has been eliminated, the enemy without guns still exists. They will inevitably wage a desperate struggle against us, and we must not underestimate these enemies." After the decisive victory of the national socialist revolution, Chairman Mao again reminded us: "The struggle to decide whether socialism or capitalism will win in ideology in our country will still take a considerable amount of time to resolve." Precisely because he foresaw these things, he took various measures to hand revolutionary theory over to the worker-peasant-soldier masses, to liberate philosophical theory from classrooms, research institutes, and offices, and to make it a sharp weapon in the hands of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    We Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers have not disappointed Chairman Mao's hopes. We follow Chairman Mao's instructions and seize the position of theory. Chairman Mao's books have the strongest class character, the highest theoretical quality, and the greatest practical significance. We workers, peasants, and soldiers participate in the practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment every day. We are best able to understand Chairman Mao's words, best able to comprehend the spiritual essence of Mao Zedong Thought. What we learn from Chairman Mao's works is all real, practical, and alive. We in Dazhai have realized that workers, peasants, and soldiers rising up to master theory and Mao Zedong Thought is not a general issue, but a fundamental issue of revolution, a fundamental issue of construction, a fundamental issue of preventing revisionism, a fundamental issue of preventing capitalist restoration, a fundamental issue of opposing imperialism, and a fundamental issue of thoroughly smashing the bourgeois "authority." Therefore, we believe that studying Chairman Mao's books and mastering Mao Zedong Thought is a need of the revolution, a need of the situation, a need to oppose American imperialist aggression and do a good job in war preparedness, a need to prevent and oppose revisionism, and a need to prevent capitalist restoration. Precisely because of this, the worker-peasant-soldier masses rising up to master Mao Zedong Thought is the trend of the times, the inevitable trend of historical development. Whoever tries to block this trend of the times is "a moth flying into the fire - seeking its own destruction."
    This truth, that truth, Chairman Mao's words are all truth. This "authority," that "authority," the workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest authority.
    Certain so-called "authorities" constantly say that they adhere to the truth, that we shouldn't "vulgarize" or "simplify" theory, etc. All of these are shields against the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and talismans against workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought. I want to ask: Do you really understand what truth is?
    The experience of Dazhai for more than twenty years after liberation proves that this truth, that truth, Chairman Mao's words are all truth. Leaving aside other things, let's just take the anti-disaster struggle since 1963: In August 1963, Dazhai suffered an unprecedented, devastating disaster. The mountains slid, the land was destroyed, the houses collapsed, and the roads were cut off. At that time, the landlords, rich peasants, and "authorities" who had been overthrown in Dazhai also gloated over our misfortune and spread poison. According to their "theories," it would be difficult for Dazhai's production to recover even in another hundred years. However, we in Dazhai remembered Chairman Mao's words: Bad things can be turned into good things, and bad things can lead to good results. After the disaster, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and made the determination to "turn bad things into good things." We repaired the land, built houses, and supported the seedlings. In the anti-disaster struggle, we learned and applied, and applied and learned. The commune members said:
  "The more we study Chairman Mao's books, the lighter the pressure becomes, the more methods we find, and the greater our drive becomes." Sure enough, spirit was transformed into matter. In 1964, we basically overcame the disaster and achieved a historically great harvest. In 1965, we suffered another severe drought of one hundred and fifty days, and we waged a tenacious and unyielding struggle against the drought. As a result, we won another bumper harvest of 796 jin per mu. From after the disaster to now, in only two years and eight months, relying on our one hundred and twenty-odd laborers, and relying on the "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" spirit that Chairman Mao spoke of, we have not only achieved bumper grain harvests year after year, but also built 148 new tile-roofed houses and 60 cave dwellings made of bluestone. All the land has been completely renovated, with better quality and higher standards than before the disaster. Now, Dazhai has "terraced fields in layers, rows of new houses, upstairs and downstairs, electric lights and telephones." A new socialist Dazhai has been initially built. Comrades who come to visit Dazhai say: Dazhai is changing every day, changing every month. We say: This is because the working people of Dazhai love to study Chairman Mao's books, study every day, study every day. Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Can you find such a "basis" in your "theories"? Can you find such a miracle in your history? You will never find it.
    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Let me tell you: We in Dazhai are not satisfied with the achievements we have made. We want to follow the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, "go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," support the world people's revolution. We will do what we say, and we will make you smash your heads against the facts!
    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Let me tell you: The real "authority" is not you, but we workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought! In the past, a saying circulated in Dazhai: "A child bride doesn't become a person, but if she becomes a person, she turns into a dragon." We child brides - the poor and lower-middle peasants - armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have already turned into "dragons." You can no longer steal food from the dragon's mouth.
    Whoever opposes us mastering Mao Zedong Thought is a counter-revolutionary, and we will fight him to the end.
    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Do you say that workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Mao Zedong's works is "vulgarization" and "simplification"? Open your ears and listen to what the people of Dazhai are saying.
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "Chairman Mao's book is a treasure among treasures, we can't live without it for generations."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle is the theory of liberation for the poor and lower-middle peasants."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "As long as we keep Chairman Mao's book, the revolutionary cause will never be lost. We must read Chairman Mao's book every day, and we will not worry about changing the world."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "After reading Chairman Mao's book, we have clear direction, we see higher, and we are not afraid of difficulties."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "With Chairman Mao's book, we can overthrow the old world, create a new world, and also defend the new world."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "With Chairman Mao's book, we can win the country and also rule the country."
    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! Do you oppose workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought? Do you want to sever our connection with the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao? Open your ears again and listen to what the people of Dazhai are saying.
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "Whoever opposes us reading Chairman Mao's book is a running dog of imperialism."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "Whoever opposes us reading Chairman Mao's book is a big traitor to the Communist Party."
    The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: "Whoever opposes us reading Chairman Mao's book is China's Khrushchev."
    The people of Dazhai have suffered enough from the "authority" of landlords and rich peasants for generations. We have tasted the sweetness of the new society. I am a farmer in my fifties, and like many class brothers in Dazhai, I have suffered the bitterness of the old society and tasted the sweetness of the new society. I understand who is good and who is bad. In the old society, I worked as a hired hand for landlords for more than twenty years. In the new society, I have engaged in revolution for more than twenty years. Under the "authority" rule of those landlords, rich peasants, traitors, and Japanese imperialists, forty poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai were forced to death by landlords and rich peasants, twenty fled to other places during famine years, forty were killed by Japanese devils and traitors, and forty sold their wives and took their children away, totaling one hundred and forty people. At that time, the living conditions of our poor and lower-middle peasants were: begging for food in childhood, working as oxen and horses for landlords and rich peasants in middle age, and dying of illness and starvation in old age, almost without exception. Now, you bourgeois "authority" gentlemen oppose us mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and you don't let us follow Chairman Mao. You want to pull us back to that cannibalistic old society. Let me tell you, the seeds that Mao Zedong Thought has sown in the minds of our poor and lower-middle peasants have already taken root and sprouted. They will grow for a thousand years, ten thousand years, and ten thousand years. Chairman Mao said: "It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to be opposed by the enemy." Your opposition to our studying Chairman Mao's works proves that we are studying correctly. Not only our generation must study, but our children and grandchildren must also study, passing it down from generation to generation. You want to alienate us from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. That is a pipe dream! We know: Whoever is with my family, I am with whoever. We are not confused about who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to attack. We want to attack you bourgeois "authorities," demons and monsters!
    Seize the "power" of the bourgeois "authority," and knock down the "prestige" of the bourgeois "authority."
    The talk has to come back, why are certain so-called "authorities" are so brave that they dare to show off their power? Because they have power, they have influence, they use the power and influence they have swindled from the Party and the people to show off their arrogance in front of the Party and the people. This is absolutely not allowed. We must take away their "power" and knock down their "prestige", pulling them off the bourgeois "authority" throne.

    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! You are prepared, organized, and planned in your opposition to the Party and Chairman Mao, and we have also made preparations early on. Chairman Mao taught us: When the enemy sharpens their knives, we must also sharpen our knives. You hold sticks in your hands, and we also hold sticks in our hands. Your sticks are "funeral staffs", and our sticks are "magic cudgels". How can a small fish stir up great waves, and how can an ant shake a big tree? 70% of the 500 million peasants in the country are poor and lower-middle peasants. We can wash you all away with our spittle, what is so great about you!

    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! You have provoked this struggle. Chairman Mao taught us: The only way to deal with the enemy's attack is to "use their own methods against them". Now that you have proactively provoked this struggle, we must take the field fully armed and fight a hard battle to the death, and we will never stop until we win complete victory!

    Bourgeois "authority" gentlemen! You are good, come stand up. Chairman Mao taught us: "If they want to fight, wipe them out completely. That's how things are, if they attack, we will eliminate them, and they will feel better. Eliminate a little, feel a little better; eliminate more, feel more comfortable; eliminate completely, completely comfortable." If one of you comes out, we will hit one, if you don't come out, we will drag you out, and we will give you a complete comfort.

    The struggle with the bourgeois "authority" is a life-and-death struggle, we are clear-eyed, clear-minded, and determined. If they dare to resist stubbornly, we will fight them for as long as they "resist", until we achieve a complete victory in this Great Cultural Revolution! We mean what we say, and we don't fire blanks! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 夺掉“权威”的霸权，打倒“权威”的威风

专栏：

    夺掉“权威”的霸权，打倒“权威”的威风
    全国人民代表大会代表、昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    编者按：陈永贵同志这篇文章写得痛快淋漓。他结合自己的切身经验，活学活用毛泽东思想，对所谓“权威”作了透彻的驳斥。
    无产阶级文化大革命，要横扫一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级“权威”。陈永贵同志说：资产阶级的“权威”，就是剥削劳动人民之“权”，欺压劳动人民之“威”。我们要打倒资产阶级的“权威”，就是要在文化领域中彻底夺资产阶级之“权”，彻底灭资产阶级之“威”，把劳动人民从各种各样的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的影响下彻底解放出来。
    陈永贵同志说得好：“资产阶级‘权威’老爷们！告诉你们：真正的‘权威’不是你们，而是我们掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵”。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能“抓住真理，所向披靡”，把一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级“权威”统统踩在脚下，把无产阶级的权威巩固地树立起来！
    资产阶级“权威”，骂我们工农兵学习毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“简单化”、“实用主义”，这真是胡说八道，比狗屁还臭。毒蛇露头，非打不行；不打，它就要伤人。我们要拿起毛泽东思想武器，拿起铁锤、铁棍、?头、扁担，把这些毒蛇统统打掉，扫除干净！
    资产阶级“权威”统治和蒙蔽人民时代已经过去了，工农兵掌握理论的时代开始了
    某些所谓“权威”，开口闭口以“权威”、“学者”自居，说什么工农兵学毛主席著作是“庸俗化”呀、“简单化”呀，告诉你，资产阶级“权威”老爷们！你们是什么“权”？什么“威”？
    在旧社会，所谓“权威”，我们经的见的太多了。他们的“权”，是压制人民之权，统治人民之权；他们的“威”，是“打讨吃，骂穷人，看不起我们工农兵”。他们的“权”是“霸权”，霸河、霸地、霸山、霸人；他们的“威”是欺负穷人的“威风”，打穷人、骂穷人、喝穷人的血、吃穷人的肉。现在你们这些“权威”老爷们，披着革命的外衣，打着共产党的旗号，过着社会主义的生活，干着反党反社会主义的勾当，为帝国主义、修正主义费尽心机。你们凭着党和人民给你们的“权”，抖威风，仗势欺人。
    在我们大寨，解放以前也有过地主、富农“权威”，他们除了在经济上剥削、压榨贫下中农以外，还用什么理论上的“权威”，来迷惑、蒙蔽我们贫下中农。如说什么“大寨的人口不能超过三百，超过了就要惹祸”呀，“核桃树十八年才能结果，种了核桃树要死人”呀。那时候，也曾蒙蔽了一些人，老年人不愿意栽核桃树，怕栽上自己吃不上；青年人不敢栽核桃树，怕栽上树自己要死命。其实，那都是地主、富农统治、愚弄农民的鬼把戏。解放以后，我们有了毛泽东思想，地主、富农的那些“理论”，就再也不能统治我们贫下中农了。现在我们大寨的人口增加到三百七十口，是人财两旺；我们栽的核桃树，是头年栽树第二年就结果！告诉你，资产阶级“权威”老爷们！虽然你们的鬼把戏比过去地主、富农高明一点，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，随身就带着“照妖镜”，耍什么鬼把戏，也要照得你们现原形。
    伟大的毛泽东时代，就是劳动人民起来闹革命的时代，就是要在政治战线、经济战线、思想文化战线上坚持把社会主义革命进行到底的时代。劳动人民要彻底革命，彻底解放，就得有锐利的武器。这武器不是别的，就是毛泽东思想。要打垮资产阶级“权威”对哲学理论的垄断，我们工农兵就得起来掌握毛主席的哲学理论。这是我们同资产阶级进行的一场你死我活的阶级大搏斗。英明伟大的毛主席在全国解放以前，他就预料到了这场不可避免的斗争。他说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在全国社会主义革命取得决定性胜利以后，毛主席又提醒我们：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”正由于他老人家预料到这些，便采取各种措施，要把革命理论交给工农兵群众，要把哲学理论从课堂上、从研究所、从办公室里解放出来，成为工农兵手中锐利的武器。
    我们中国的工农兵，没有辜负毛主席的希望，我们遵照毛主席的指示，夺取理论的阵地。毛主席的书阶级性最强，理论性最高，实践性最大。我们工农兵，每天参加生产斗争、阶级斗争、科学实验的实践，我们最能懂得毛主席的话，最能领会毛泽东思想的精神实质，我们从毛主席著作中所学到的东西，全是真的、实的、活的。我们大寨人体会到，工农兵起来掌握理论，掌握毛主席思想，那不是一般问题，而是革命的根本，建设的根本，防止修正主义的根本，防止资本主义复辟的根本，反对帝国主义的根本，彻底粉碎资产阶级“权威”的根本。所以，我们认为，学习毛主席的书，掌握毛泽东思想，是革命的需要，是形势的需要，是反对美帝国主义侵略，搞好战备的需要，是防止和反对修正主义的需要，是防止资本主义复辟的需要。正是由于这样，工农兵群众起来掌握毛泽东思想，是时代的潮流，是历史发展的必然趋势。谁要阻挡这个时代潮流，谁就是“扑灯蛾投火——自寻灭亡”。
    这真理，那真理，毛主席的话句句是真理。这“权威”，那“权威”，掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵是最大的权威
    某些所谓“权威”，口口声声说什么坚持真理呀，不要把理论“庸俗化”、“简单化”呀，等等，所有这些，都是反对党中央、反对毛主席的挡箭牌，反对工农兵掌握毛泽东思想的护身符。我要问一问：你们究竟懂得什么是真理？
    我们大寨解放以后二十多年的经验证明，这真理，那真理，毛主席的话句句是真理。别的不说，就以一九六三年以来的抗灾斗争来说吧：一九六三年八月，大寨遭了历史上没有过的、毁灭性的灾害，山溜了，地毁了，房倒了，路断了。那时，大寨被打倒的地主、富农、“权威”，也曾幸灾乐祸，散布毒素。根据他们的“理论”，再有一百年，大寨的生产也再难恢复了。可是，我们大寨人就记住毛主席的一句话：坏事可以变成好事，坏的东西可以引出好的结果。灾后，我们遵照毛主席的教导，下了“一定要把坏事变成好事”的决心，修土地，盖房屋，扶禾苗，在抗灾斗争中，我们边学边用，边用边学。社员们说：
  “毛主席的书，越学压力越轻，越学办法越多，越学干劲越大。”果然，精神变物质，一九六四年，就基本上战胜了灾害，取得了历史上的特大丰收。一九六五年，又遭了一百五十天的大旱，我们又与干旱进行了顽强不屈的斗争，结果又夺了亩产七百九十六斤的大丰收。灾后到现在，只有两年零八个月时间，就凭着我们的一百二十多个劳力，就凭着毛主席所说的
  “愚公移山”精神，不仅取得了粮食连年丰收，还新修瓦房一百四十八间，青石窑洞六十孔，所有的土地，全部进行了整修，比灾前质量更好，标准更高。现在，大寨是“层层梯田，排排新房，楼上楼下，电灯电话”，一个社会主义新大寨已初步建成。来大寨参观的同志们说：大寨是天天变，月月变。我们说：这是因为大寨的劳动人民爱学毛主席的书，天天学，日日学。资产阶级“权威”老爷们！从你们的“理论”上，能找到这样的“根据”吗？在你们的历史上，能找到这样的奇迹吗？永远也找不到。
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！告诉你们：我们大寨人，并不以取得现有的成绩为满足，我们要遵照党中央和毛主席的教导，“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”，支援世界人民革命，我们说得到做得到，要让你们在事实面前碰得头破血流！
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！告诉你们：真正的“权威”不是你们，而是我们掌握了毛泽东思想的工农兵！过去，我们大寨流传着一句俗话：“童养媳妇不成人，成了人了变成龙”。我们这些童养媳妇——贫下中农，在毛泽东思想武装下，已经变成“龙”了，你们再想从“龙口夺食”，那万万办不到了。
    谁要反对我们掌握毛泽东思想，谁就是反革命，我们就和他拼到底
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！你们说工农兵学毛泽东著作“庸俗化”、“简单化”吗？你们扒开耳朵听听，看我们大寨人是怎样说的。
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“毛主席书是宝中宝，祖祖辈辈离不了。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“毛主席的阶级斗争学说，就是贫下中农翻身求解放的学说。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“只要保住毛主席书，革命事业永不丢，天天要读毛主席书，改天换地不发愁。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“读了毛主席的书，方向明，看得高，遇到困难吓不倒。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“有了毛主席的书，我们能推翻旧世界，创造新世界，也能保卫新世界。”
    我们大寨贫下中农说：“有了毛主席的书，我们能打江山，也能坐江山。”
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！你们反对工农兵掌握毛泽东思想吗？你们想割断我们和党中央、毛主席的联系吗？你们扒开耳朵再听听，看我们大寨人又是怎样说的。
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“谁要反对我们读毛主席书，谁就是帝国主义大走狗。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“谁要反对我们读毛主席书，谁就是共产党的大叛徒。”
    我们大寨的贫下中农说：“谁要反对我们读毛主席书，谁就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。”
    我们大寨人祖祖辈辈吃尽了地主、富农“权威”的苦头。尝到了新社会的甜头。我是一个五十多岁的农民，同大寨的许多阶级弟兄一样，吃过旧社会的苦，尝到新社会的甜，最懂得谁好谁坏。在旧社会，我给地主扛过二十多年长工，新社会，我干过二十多年革命。在那些地主、富农、汉奸、日本帝国主义的“权威”统治下，大寨的贫下中农被地主、富农逼死的有四十人，灾荒年月逃荒外地的有二十人，被日本鬼子、汉奸杀死的四十人，卖了老婆、带走子女的有四十人，共一百四十人。那时候，我们贫下中农的生活处境是：童年讨吃要饭，中年为地主、富农当牛当马，老年病饿而死，几乎无一例外。现在，你们这些资产阶级“权威”老爷们，反对我们掌握毛泽东思想，不让我们跟毛主席走，就是想把我们拉回到那吃人的旧社会去。告诉你们，毛泽东思想给我们贫下中农思想上撒下的种子，已经生根发芽，她要生长一千年，一万年，万万年。毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”你们反对我们学习毛主席著作，正说明我们学对了。不仅我们这一辈要学，我们的儿孙也要学，要代代相传，一脉不断。你们想离间我们和党中央、毛主席的关系，那是白日做梦！我们知道：谁和我一家，我和谁一家。依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁，我们并不糊涂，我们要打击的，就是你们这些资产阶级“权威”、牛鬼蛇神！
    把资产阶级“权威”的“大权”夺过来，把资产阶级“权威”的“威风”打倒在地
    话还得说回来，某些所谓“权威”，为什么他们敢抖威风？因为他们有权，有势，他们借着向党和人民骗来的权势，在党和人民面前抖威风。这是万万不行的。必须把他们的“权”夺过来，把他们的“威风”打倒在地，把他们从资产阶级的“权威”宝座上拉下来。
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！你们反党反毛主席是有准备、有组织、有计划的，我们也是早做了准备的。毛主席教导我们：敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀。你们手里把着棍子，我们也拿着棍子。你们的棍子是“哭丧杖”，我们的棍子是“千钧棒”。一条小鱼，怎能掀起大浪，一只蚍蜉，岂能摇动大树。全国五亿农民，有百分之七十是贫下中农，我们唾一口唾沫，也能把你们冲走，你们有什么了不起！
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！这场斗争是你们挑起的。毛主席教导我们：对待敌人的进攻，只能是“以其人之道还治其人之身”。既然你们主动地挑起了这场斗争，我们就要全副武装上阵，打一场你死我活的硬仗，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们！是好样的，你们统统站出来吧。毛主席教导我们：“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”你们出来一个，我们就打一个，你们不出来，我们就把你们揪出来，总得给你们个彻底舒服。
    和资产阶级“权威”的斗争，是一场你死我活的斗争，我们眼明，心亮，决心大，他们如果敢于负隅顽抗，他们“抗”到什么时候，我们就和他们斗到什么时候，直至取得这场文化大革命的彻底胜利！我们是说到做到，不放空炮！（新华社）
