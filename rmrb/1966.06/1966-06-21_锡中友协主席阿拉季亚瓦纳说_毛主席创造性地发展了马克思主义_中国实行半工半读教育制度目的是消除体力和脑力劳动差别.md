Chairman Mao is respected because he creatively developed Marxism."

    Aladyiawana praised China's policy of self-reliance. He said, "The policy of self-reliance implemented by China is a great example for us. This is the main weapon for China to achieve development." He said that because of the implementation of this policy, "China today does not owe any country a penny, and it has already developed so much."
    Regarding education, he praised the part-work part-study system implemented in China. He said, "The purpose of implementing this education system is to eliminate the difference between manual labor and mental labor."

    新华社科伦坡十九日电  锡中友好协会主席阿拉季亚瓦纳十八日晚上在科伦坡就他最近对中国的访问向公众作报告说：“毛主席思想在中国非常受尊敬。毛主席所以受尊敬，是因为他创造性地发展了马克思主义。”
    阿拉季亚瓦纳说，中国在各个领域中取得的成就和发展，要归功于以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的正确领导和“政治第一”的思想。
    阿拉季亚瓦纳赞赏中国的自力更生政策。他说，“中国实行的自力更生政策对于我们是一个伟大的榜样。这是中国取得发展的主要武器。”他说，由于实行了这种政策，“中国今天不欠任何国家一块钱，而它已经那么发达了。”
    关于教育问题，他赞扬了中国所实行的半工半读制度。他说：“执行这种教育制度的目的是消除体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别。”他说，中国采取这些措施，是为了防止产生新的资产阶级。他还说，实际上，“中国的教育涉及一切方面。没有一个地方不是在进行教育”。
