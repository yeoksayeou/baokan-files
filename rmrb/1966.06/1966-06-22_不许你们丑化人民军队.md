    The history of the Chinese People's Liberation War is a history of the victory of Mao Zedong's military thought. In this unprecedented great liberation war in Chinese and foreign history, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, annihilated the eight million reactionary troops of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty supported by US imperialism, and buried the reactionary and dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek group.

    However, "Adverse Winds for a Thousand Li" directs its spearhead at our army from the very beginning. The medic Zhu Xiaoling's white horse, carrying a medicine box, gets startled and runs away. She follows behind, shouting loudly, "Catch it!" The white horse passes through our troops, but our soldiers are indifferent. Instead, they let the prisoner Yang Ziming volunteer to chase the white horse and take the opportunity to escape.

    Although the film also adorns itself with the annihilation of the enemy's "Thousand Li Colt" division, this is a smokescreen. In reality, the director is deliberately beautifying the enemy. Look, after our army annihilates the "Thousand Li Colt" division, it retreats in a hurry, Fengcheng falls prematurely, and our troop escorting prisoners is ambushed and intercepted by the enemy along the way. The enemy is aggressive and pursues along the way.

    Enemy officers Sun Zhenrong and Zhang Lanshan secretly plot and deliberately drag down our army. Our army is helpless. Instructor Song Zhigang has to beg the enemy, "This place is desolate, can you walk a few steps ahead to find a way?" Even Sun Zhenrong can secretly move under the surveillance of our army's sentry, instructing his subordinates to move away the sentry guarding him. The enemy even makes a big fuss over a bowl of egg drop soup, smashing the bowl. Faced with the enemy's extreme arrogance, our army can only swallow its anger and is unable to deal with it. We are the great People's Liberation Army, an army created by Chairman Mao himself, with a high degree of political consciousness and strong combat effectiveness. Each and every one of us is resourceful and brave, and in any situation, we have the spirit of advancing bravely and overwhelming the enemy. In the Xinkailing Campaign, the enemy was battered by our army, and a large number of senior officers became our prisoners. However, in the film "Adverse Winds for a Thousand Li," the director portrays the enemy as vigorous and rampant, stirring up a wave of reactionary evil winds and reactionary dark waves, while our small detachment escorting the enemy is weak and incompetent, submissive, muddleheaded, and pathetic. Isn't this the director viciously distorting and slandering our army, and doing his best to praise and beautify the enemy!

    Chairman Mao said: "Mistakes must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be struggled against." We must criticize and eradicate all poisonous weeds. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, eradicate all poisonous weeds, and overthrow all demons and monsters!

### 不许你们丑化人民军队

    不许你们丑化人民军队
    一部中国人民解放战争的历史，就是毛泽东军事思想胜利的历史。在这场中外历史上空前伟大的解放战争中，中国人民解放军和全国人民，在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，消灭了美帝国主义支持下的蒋家王朝的八百万反动军队，埋葬了蒋介石集团的反动、黑暗统治。
    可是，《逆风千里》一开始就把进攻的矛头指向我军。卫生员朱小玲的白马驮着药箱受惊跑了，她跟在后边不住地大声喊：“捉住它！”白马在我部队面前穿过，我们的战士却无动于衷，反而让俘虏杨子鸣自报奋勇，追赶白马，而趁机逃跑了。
    影片虽然也点缀了一下我军歼灭了敌军“千里驹”师，但这是幌子，实际上编导者在有意美化敌人。你看吧，我军歼灭“千里驹”师后匆匆忙忙地撤退了，奉城提前失守了，我押送俘虏的部队一路遭到敌人追击截杀，敌人则气势汹汹，沿途追击。
    敌军孙振戎与张兰山密谋策划，故意拖着我军。我军毫无办法，指导员宋志刚只好央告敌人：“这里荒无人烟，你能不能走几步到前面想办法？”甚至，孙振戎在我军岗哨监视下还能秘密活动，他指示部下把看守他的岗哨调开；敌人还因为一碗鸡蛋汤的事，大吵大闹，把碗都打碎了。对于敌人这种极度的嚣张，我军也只能忍气吞声，无法对付。我们是伟大的人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造起来的军队，有着高度的政治觉悟和强大的战斗力，一个个都是机智勇敢，无论在任何情况下，都有一往无前、压倒敌人的气概。在新开岭战役中，敌人被我军打得焦头烂额，大批高级军官成了我军的俘虏。可是，在《逆风千里》这部影片里，编导者却把敌人写得神气活现，疯狂猖獗，刮起一阵阵的反动妖风，掀起一个个的反动黑浪，而我押送敌人的小分队却个个懦弱无能，逆来顺受，浑浑噩噩，灰溜溜的不象样儿。这不是编导者恶毒歪曲和污蔑我军，极力赞颂和美化敌人吗！
    毛主席说：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”凡是毒草我们就要批判它，铲除它。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把一切毒草都铲尽除绝，把一切牛鬼蛇神统统打倒！
