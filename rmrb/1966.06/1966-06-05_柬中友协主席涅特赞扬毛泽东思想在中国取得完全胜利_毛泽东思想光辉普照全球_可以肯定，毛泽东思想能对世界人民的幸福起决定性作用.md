    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 3rd - Ran Niet, chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, who recently led a delegation to visit China, told a reporter from the *Industrie et Commerce* on May 30: "Although we only spent a month on a friendly visit to China, we deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought has achieved a complete victory in China. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon of our time. The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought not only shines throughout China, but also illuminates the entire world."

    He said, "Now, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing bravely on all revolutionary fronts, holding high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. All countries and peoples subjected to aggression are also fighting under the influence of Mao Zedong Thought, powerfully impacting imperialism and colonialism. It can be affirmed that Mao Zedong's great thought will certainly play a decisive role in world peace and the happiness of the people of all countries."

    Ran Niet, when discussing the industrial construction situation in Northeast China, said that in the many factories we visited, we saw people producing with great enthusiasm and selflessness. We saw things in China that had never existed before, and that are rare even in the world. China now has many factories that manufacture various kinds of machinery.

    He pointed out that China's ability to achieve such a great victory is not due to anything else, but to the 650 million Chinese people resolutely studying Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people achieved revolutionary victory. Similarly, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are achieving great victories today. One can imagine how brilliant China's future will be!

    He said that the delegation he led visited some people's communes. He said that he visited the Chinese countryside in 1959, and since then, China's people's communes have developed rapidly. Elementary and middle schools have been established in the Chinese rural people's communes, and agriculture has been greatly mechanized. The lives of the people's commune members have improved even more than in 1959, and basic needs such as food, clothing, and housing have been largely resolved. He emphasized: "Compared with the past, it is very clear today that the face of the Chinese countryside has changed."

    In his conversation, Ran Niet also talked about the fighting friendship between the Cambodian and Chinese peoples. He said: "The friendship between Cambodia and China has a long history. Today, in the common struggle against imperialism, especially against US imperialism, the friendship between the two countries has become more consolidated and strengthened. US imperialism stubbornly pursues its policies of aggression and war, and constantly instigates its Thai and South Vietnamese puppets to invade Cambodia. Under these circumstances, strengthening the friendship between China and Cambodia is of great significance. China and Cambodia must unite and fight uncompromisingly against the aggressors. We are confident that final victory will surely belong to us."

    柬中友协主席涅特赞扬毛泽东思想在中国取得完全胜利
    毛泽东思想光辉普照全球
    可以肯定，毛泽东思想能对世界人民的幸福起决定性作用
    新华社金边三日电　最近曾率代表团访问过中国的柬中友好协会主席兰·涅特五月三十日向《工商报》记者说：“虽然我们在中国进行友好访问只有一个月的时间，但是我们深深地感到，毛泽东思想在中国已经取得了完全的胜利。毛泽东思想是当代最强大的武器。毛泽东思想的光辉不仅照耀着整个中国，而且也普照着全世界。”
    他说，“现在，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，正在各条革命战线上高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜奋勇前进。所有受侵略的国家和人民，也在毛泽东思想的影响下进行斗争，有力地冲击着帝国主义和殖民主义。可以肯定，毛泽东的伟大思想一定能够对世界和平以及世界各国人民的幸福起决定性的作用。”
    兰·涅特谈到参观中国东北工业建设情况时说，在我们参观的许多工厂里，看到人们都以高度的热情和忘我精神进行生产。我们看到了中国从来不曾有过的甚至世界上也是少见的东西，现在中国已经出现了许多制造各种机器的工厂。
    他指出，中国能取得如此伟大的胜利，这不是因为别的，而是六亿五千万中国人民坚决学习毛泽东思想的结果。在毛泽东思想的指引下，中国人民取得了革命的胜利，同样，在毛泽东思想的指引下，中国人民今天又取得了伟大的胜利。可以想象，中国的未来将会何等的光辉灿烂！
    他说，他率领的代表团参观了一些人民公社。他说，一九五九年他参观过中国的农村，从那时到现在，中国的人民公社已经有了迅速的发展。中国农村人民公社中，设立了小学和中学，农业已经大大机械化。人民公社社员的生活已经比一九五九年更加提高了，吃、穿、住等已经基本解决。他强调指出：“同过去相比，今天可以很清楚地看到中国农村的面貌已经改观。”
    兰·涅特在谈话中还谈到柬中两国人民的战斗友谊。他说：“柬中两国的友谊具有悠久的历史，今天在反对帝国主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，两国的友谊更加巩固和加强了。美帝国主义顽固地推行它的侵略和战争政策，不断唆使它的泰国和南越傀儡侵略柬埔寨。在这种情况下，加强中柬之间的友谊具有重要意义，中国和柬埔寨必须团结一致，不妥协地同侵略者作斗争。我们确信，最后胜利一定属于我们。”
