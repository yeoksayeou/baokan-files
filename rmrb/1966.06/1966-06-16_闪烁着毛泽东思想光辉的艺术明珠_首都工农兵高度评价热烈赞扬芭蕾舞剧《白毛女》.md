    Xinhua News Agency, June 15th—Our reporter reports: The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital are appraising and praising the large-scale revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" with strong revolutionary passion. They unanimously praised this artistic pearl shining with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought as a new achievement of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and another good model of revolutionary literature and art following the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women", the revolutionary modern Peking Opera "The Red Lantern", the symphonic music "Shajiabang", the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard", and others. From the performance of this play, they once again concluded: As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implement the Party and Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, we will surely be able to build the most glorious and splendid socialist new literature and art in human history.
    The revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was performed in the capital for thirty-three shows from April 30th to June 13th, each show fully booked. With its strong socialist spirit of the times, profound ideological content, and new form of revolutionary ballet art, it has won enthusiastic praise from more than 50,000 Chinese and foreign audiences in the capital. Hundreds of thousands more audiences enjoyed the ballet through television.
    The revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl", born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is another artillery shell fired at the ideological and cultural fronts controlled by those anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs; it powerfully encourages the revolutionary fighting spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Many worker, peasant, and soldier audiences, in their class-emotion-filled congratulatory letters and articles, and at symposiums held with the actors, particularly emphasized that the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has significant political meaning. They believe that the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, based on the height of the socialist era, and re-creating based on the opera of the same name from the New Democratic period, eulogized the great Mao Zedong Thought, successfully shaped the image of the poor peasant hero who dared to resist and dared to struggle, and established it highly on the ballet stage. This is another artillery shell fired at the ideological and cultural fronts controlled by those anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, fiercely bombarding those monsters and demons who promote bourgeois literary and artistic thought and so-called literary and art of the 1930s; it powerfully encourages the revolutionary fighting spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Worker, peasant, and soldier audiences quoted Chairman Mao's words, saying that in the world today, all culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class and a certain political line. If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not praise the proletariat but praise the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not praise the bourgeoisie but praise the proletariat and the working people. There is no third way. They said that for more than ten years since the founding of the country, the Beijing art stage has still been filled with emperors, generals, ministers, talented scholars, and beautiful women, and even dead ghosts have been brought onto the stage. Why not perform the stories of Daqing "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, Chen Yonggui, and Ouyang Hai-style worker, peasant, and soldier heroes? This is because a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang elements have blocked the door and do not allow it; it is because bourgeois and modern revisionist literature and art are desperately advocating performing so-called "middle characters," writing about so-called "not good, not bad, mediocre masses," preventing worker, peasant, and soldier heroes from ascending the art stage. It is very clear that which class is eulogized, which class's heroic figures are shaped, and which class is allowed to occupy a dominant position on the art stage is precisely the focus of the current class struggle on the literary and art front between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
    Shi Chuanxiang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a sanitation worker in Chongwen District, Beijing, said in a discussion that history is created by us working people. The working people who were beasts of burden in the old society have become masters of the country after liberation, and I, a night soil collector, have also become a representative of the National People's Congress. These monsters and demons do not allow us workers, peasants, and soldiers who have already ascended the political stage to go to the art stage, completely reversing history, which can only show that they extremely hate the proletariat and the working people who are masters of their own affairs; they are actually attempting to use the art stage to peddle bourgeois and revisionist black goods, corrode the souls of the revolutionary people, and carry out capitalist restoration activities using this method of "peaceful evolution." Many worker, peasant, and soldier audiences said that we must thoroughly overthrow all reactionary literature and art that serves the restoration of the bourgeoisie and establish a new socialist literature and art in order to firmly occupy the literary and art front. Following Chairman Mao's teachings and with the idea of writing biographies for the poor and lower-middle peasants, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School enthusiastically eulogized the revolutionary spirit of the poor peasants in the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," gloriously displaying the excellent class qualities of the Chinese rural proletariat who are not afraid of the powerful, not afraid of authority, dare to resist, and dare to struggle, fully expressing what we workers, peasants, and soldiers want to say in our hearts, truly achieving what Chairman Mao said of becoming "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy, helping the people to fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind."
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" more prominently and profoundly reflects the life-and-death class struggle situation during China's democratic revolution, placing the peasants' struggle against oppression and exploitation in the primary position, and pointing out that the leadership of the Party and armed struggle are the only way for all oppressed people to strive for freedom and liberation.
    When commenting on the great achievements of this ballet, worker, peasant, and soldier audiences said that the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, using Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle, re-analyzed the original opera, further recognizing the rural class relations and class struggle during China's democratic revolution. Their new work more prominently and profoundly reflects the life-and-death class struggle situation at that time, placing the peasants' struggle against oppression and exploitation in the primary position, and pointing out that the leadership of the Party and armed struggle are the only way for all oppressed people to strive for freedom and liberation. They seized on this characteristic of class struggle to conceive the plot, shaping the images of representative figures of the oppressed class, such as Xi'er, Yang Bailao, Wang Dachun, and Uncle Zhao in the opera, in a taller, more typical, and more ideal way, making it clear to people the brilliance of these characters' unyielding and resisting to the end revolutionary character. This new treatment has enabled the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" to embody the spirit of the socialist era and play a greater role in encouraging and educating the broad masses of people today.
    Many worker, peasant, and soldier audiences said that they were particularly satisfied with the images of Yang Bailao and Xi'er portrayed in the play. Zhang Tilun, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Nan Zhangdai Production Brigade in the suburbs of Beijing, said that this play fully portrays the hard-boned spirit of our poor and lower-middle peasants in resisting exploitation and oppression. In past movies and operas, Yang Bailao committed suicide by drinking brine, which always made people feel a little uncomfortable. This time, in the ballet, when Yang Bailao was forced to a dead end by the landlord, he picked up a carrying pole and swung it at the landlord... This pole hit well! It hit out our class hatred and class resentment, and it hit out the backbone of the poor who would rather die than yield. He also said: Before liberation, there was an old poor peasant named Zhang Jihong in our village. The traitors and landlords used him as a beast of burden and still tried not to pay him, forcing him to pick up a sharp knife and fight with the landlord. The landlord colluded with the Japanese devils and used bayonets and bullets to kill Zhang Jihong. He was seriously injured, and even when he was dying, he fought the enemy with stones and poles. The good thing about the play "The White-Haired Girl" is that it reflects this hard-boned spirit of our poor and lower-middle peasants. Han Jie, a soldier from a naval unit of the People's Liberation Army, said that in the ballet, Xi'er is not a slave who kneels and begs for mercy in front of the rulers, but bravely fights the enemy with her chest held high, not being humiliated by the enemy. In the end, she finally escaped from the Huang family, which made people feel happy. When Xi'er met Huang Shiren in the Grandma Temple, she angrily raised the candlestick and smashed it. This was not just smashing at one of her enemies, but smashing at the dark society and feudal forces. She wanted to smash the man-eating feudal system and smash the evil old world. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" highlights the resistance of the peasants in this way, which is completely in line with the truth of history. After Xi'er's hometown was liberated by the Eighth Route Army, she did not stop fighting because she had gained happiness and punished her enemy Huang Shiren, but instead took up a gun and continued the revolution, liberating the thousands of people still living inhuman lives under the system of exploitation, and carrying the revolution through to the end. This made me think that two-thirds of the world's people are still suffering, and I must have the motherland in my heart, look at the world, and join the people of the world in fiercely attacking and eliminating our common enemy—US imperialism—until the people of the whole world are liberated like Xi'er. Zhang Jinghe, a five-good worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said in a discussion that we proletariat are hard-boned and have never been weak. Before liberation, my family's experience was the same as "The White-Haired Girl." From the time I entered the factory as a child laborer at the age of eight, I fought with the Japanese devils. When the capitalists oppressed us, we had to fight to survive. He excitedly said to the actors: Watching this play is really enjoyable, you understand the hearts of our workers!
    The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marked the newness of socialism, established the difference of the proletariat, drove away all the foreign talents and beautiful women, and allowed the proletariat and the working people to ascend the socialist ballet stage as the protagonists.
    The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promoted the revolutionary spirit of daring to break and daring to establish, and launched an attack on the foreign classical ballet, which the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" regarded as "sacred and inviolable," creating a revolutionary modern ballet, giving ballet art a new life, and winning the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said: The ballet in the past was a position for the bourgeoisie to peddle poison. What Swan Lake, Giselle...are all corrupt, decadent, and reactionary foreign things. We don't want to look at it at all, and we hate it from the bottom of our hearts. For many years, bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" have touted this kind of thing as the "supreme" "artistic peak," saying that it is untouchable and cannot be surpassed, and moving it to the stage without any changes, poisoning the revolutionary people and "undermining the foundations of socialism" spiritually. In this sharp class struggle in dance art, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School were not intimidated by the reactionary theories of the bourgeois "authorities." They bravely broke the "foreign framework" and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, as well as the principles of "making foreign things serve China" and "making the past serve the present," marked the newness of socialism, established the difference of the proletariat, drove away all the foreign talents and beautiful women, and allowed the proletariat and the working people to ascend the socialist ballet stage as the protagonists, letting the fighting lives of the revolutionary people replace the love affairs of princes and princesses and the bourgeoisie in feudal society, becoming the brand-new content of the revolutionary ballet. This is the result of the actors and directors emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and it is another great victory in the ballet revolution following The Red Detachment of Women. Chen Fa, a representative of the National People's Congress and an old worker of the "February 7th" strike, said excitedly in a discussion with the actors: "You have ambition! The play you perform has a revolutionary style! We, the working class, are infinitely proud and infinitely proud of your courage to fundamentally transform ballet into the artistic wealth of the people!" Many worker audiences also used the great achievements they had made in adhering to self-reliance on the production front to encourage the actors, saying: We Chinese people must have ambition. What foreigners have, we must have, and what foreigners don't have, we must also have. What bourgeois "experts" don't allow to break, we must resolutely break. We have established good models like Daqing and Dazhai in industry and agriculture, and we must also establish many good models like The Red Detachment of Women and The White-Haired Girl in culture and art, and show them to those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," and show them to the imperialists and modern revisionists, and tell them: Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, we can create any miracle and break through any stubborn fortress! Your artistic practice has proven the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, and it has proven that as long as the cultural revolution army of the proletariat adheres to Chairman Mao's direction on literature and art, there will be no fortress that cannot be taken down and no position that cannot be occupied.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is good in terms of nationalization, massification, composition, music, and stage art, and it has new developments and creations.
    The worker, peasant, and soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only warmly praised the ideological content of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" from a political standard, but also highly evaluated the new form and new techniques of this revolutionary ballet art. They believe that this ballet is good in terms of nationalization, massification, composition, music, and stage art, and it has new developments and creations.
    Li Hong and others from the Beijing Metal Structure Factory said that the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" not only maintains the characteristics of ballet dance, such as large movements and strong jumping, and retains many difficult movements such as rotations and pointe work, as well as basic forms such as solo dances, pas de deux, and group dances, but also creates new dance language and performance techniques. It successfully used the movements of Chinese opera and traditional national dance, making ballet art nationalized and massified. They said that this ballet is truly a play in dance and dance in play, everything starts from life and everything starts from content; it is fundamentally different from some foreign classical ballets, which only grind their toes, dance for dance, and dance for art, and often become pure technical performances divorced from content and character.
    Many worker, peasant, and soldier audiences cited one of the most exciting scenes in this ballet—the pas de deux of Dachun and Xi'er reuniting in the seventh act—saying that the plot and the inner activities of the characters are particularly rich and moving: Xi'er initially mistook Dachun for Huang Shiren's lackey and resisted angrily. Later, she recognized that he was a relative and was both sad and happy; until she met with the villagers, she walked out of the Black Mountain Cave facing the red sun. The actors appropriately used lifting movements and their own created new ballet dance vocabulary to perfectly express it, which is not easy. Many people said that this scene grabbed our hearts.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" broke the fixed pattern of classical ballets that only dance and do not sing. On the basis of using dance movements to portray characters, it boldly added twenty solo and chorus accompaniments with distinct national styles, creating a new form of ballet that combines singing and dancing, which is particularly popular among worker, peasant, and soldier audiences. They believe that adding accompaniment to this ballet can better express the dramatic content, better highlight the characters' personalities, better shape the characters' images, and also better help the audience understand the plot, allowing the audience to hear clearly and see clearly. Wang Guoyin, a worker at the Beijing No. 1 State Cotton Factory, said that because the dance and accompaniment are harmoniously unified, Xi'er's image appears to be fleshy and very full. At the critical moment, a high song fully demonstrates Xi'er's spiritual world, making us closer to Xi'er and our hearts closer to her. She also said: Xi'er, with scars all over her body and full of anger, escaped from the Huang family, and the accompanist sang "I want to live, I want revenge..." This song shook our hearts. This is not singing, but Xi'er is using all her strength to accuse and shout, fully demonstrating Xi'er's strong character and the fire of revenge. Many worker, peasant, and soldier audiences said: The accompaniment when Xi'er and the villagers were liberated: "The sun is coming out, the sun is coming out, the sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party," not only sang Xi'er, but also sang our infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao.

    闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的艺术明珠
    首都工农兵高度评价热烈赞扬芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》
    新华社十五日讯　本社记者报道：首都广大工农兵观众怀着强烈的革命激情，评赞大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。他们一致称赞这颗闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的艺术明珠，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的新成果，是继芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、革命现代京剧《红灯记》、交响音乐《沙家浜》、泥塑《收租院》等之后出现的又一个革命文艺的好样板。他们从这个剧的演出，再一次得出结论：只要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻党和毛主席的文艺路线，我们就一定能够建立人类历史上最光辉灿烂的社会主义新文艺。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》从四月三十日到六月十三日在首都演出三十三场，场场满座。它以强烈的社会主义时代精神、深刻的思想内容和革命芭蕾舞艺术的新形式，赢得了首都五万多名中外观众的热烈赞扬，还有成千上万名观众通过电视欣赏了这一舞剧。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命的现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是向那些反党反社会主义黑帮控制的思想文化阵地射出的又一发大炮弹；它有力地鼓舞了广大工农兵的革命斗志。
    许多工农兵观众在充满阶级感情的贺信和文章中，在同演员一起举行的座谈会上，特别强调指出，在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》具有重大政治意义。他们认为，上海市舞蹈学校师生高举毛泽东思想红旗，立足于社会主义时代高度，根据新民主主义时期的同名歌剧进行再创作，歌颂了伟大的毛泽东思想，成功地塑造了敢于反抗、敢于斗争的贫农英雄形象，在芭蕾艺术舞台上高高地树立起来，这是向那些反党反社会主义黑帮控制的思想文化阵地射出的又一发大炮弹，狠狠地轰击了那些宣扬资产阶级文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的牛鬼蛇神；有力地鼓舞了广大工农兵的革命斗志。
    工农兵观众引用毛主席的话说，在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民。二者必居其一。他们说，建国十多年了，北京艺术舞台上还是搬帝王将相、才子佳人，连死鬼也上了台，为什么不演大庆“铁人”王进喜、陈永贵、欧阳海式的工农兵英雄？就是因为有一小撮反党反社会主义黑帮分子把住了门，不让搬；就是因为资产阶级和现代修正主义文艺拼命提倡演什么“中间人物”，写所谓“不好不坏、亦好亦坏、中不溜儿的芸芸众生”，阻挡工农兵英雄登上艺术舞台。很明显，歌颂哪一个阶级，塑造哪一个阶级的英雄人物，让哪一个阶级在艺术舞台上占统治地位，正是当前文艺战线上无产阶级同资产阶级斗争的焦点。
    全国人民代表大会代表、北京市崇文区清洁工人时传祥在座谈中说，历史是我们劳动人民创造的，旧社会当牛作马的劳动人民在解放后当了国家的主人，我这个掏粪工人也当了全国人民代表大会代表。这些牛鬼蛇神竟不让我们已经登上政治舞台的工农兵群众走上艺术舞台，把历史完全颠倒过来，只能说明他们极端仇视当家作主的无产阶级和劳动人民；他们实际上是企图利用艺术舞台，贩卖资产阶级、修正主义黑货，腐蚀革命人民的灵魂，用这种“和平演变”的手法进行资本主义复辟活动。许多工农兵观众都说，我们一定要彻底打倒一切为资产阶级复辟服务的反动文艺，建立社会主义的新文艺，才能巩固地占领文艺阵地。上海市舞蹈学校师生遵循毛主席的教导，本着为贫下中农立传的思想，在舞剧《白毛女》中满腔热情地歌颂贫农的革命精神，把中国农村无产阶级不畏强暴、不惧权势、敢于反抗、敢于斗争的优秀的阶级品质光辉地显示出来，充分表达了我们工农兵心里要说的话，真正做到象毛主席所说的成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》更突出、更深刻地反映了我国民主革命时期你死我活的阶级斗争情况，把农民反压迫、反剥削的斗争放在主要地位，并指出党的领导和武装斗争，是一切被压迫人民争取自由解放的唯一道路。
    工农兵观众在评述这出舞剧的巨大成就时说，上海市舞蹈学校师生运用毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的学说，对原歌剧重新作了分析，进一步认识到我国民主革命时期农村阶级关系和阶级斗争，在他们的新作中更突出、更深刻地反映了当时你死我活的阶级斗争情况，把农民反压迫、反剥削的斗争放在主要地位，并指出党的领导和武装斗争是一切被压迫人民争取自由解放的唯一道路。他们抓住这一阶级斗争的特点来构思情节，把歌剧中的喜儿、杨白劳、王大春、赵大叔等被压迫阶级的代表人物的形象塑造得更高大、更典型、更理想，使人清楚地看到这些人物不屈不挠、反抗到底的革命性格的光辉。这样重新处理的结果，就使芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》体现了社会主义时代精神，对今天广大人民群众起到更大的鼓舞和教育作用。
    许多工农兵观众都谈到，他们对剧中塑造的杨白劳和喜儿的形象特别满意。北京郊区南张岱生产大队党支部书记张体伦说，这出戏，把咱贫农下中农反剥削反压迫的硬骨头劲儿演足了。过去的电影和戏里，杨白劳是喝盐卤自杀的，叫人瞧了，心里总有点憋得慌。这回芭蕾舞剧里，杨白劳叫地主逼得无路可走的时候，抄起扁担就朝地主抡过去……这一扁担打得好！打出了我们的阶级仇、阶级恨，打出了穷人宁死不屈的骨气。他还说：解放前，我们村里有一个老贫农张继红，汉奸、地主拿他当牛马使唤，还想不给工钱，逼得他拿起尖刀就跟地主拼。地主勾结日本鬼子用刺刀、枪弹杀害张继红，他身受重伤，临死还拿石头、杠子跟敌人斗。《白毛女》这出戏好就好在它反映了我们贫农下中农的这种硬骨头精神。解放军海军某部战士韩杰说，舞剧中，喜儿不是在统治者面前屈膝乞怜的奴隶，而是挺起胸来和敌人英勇斗争，不受敌人污辱。最后终于逃出黄家，看了让人心里痛快。喜儿在奶奶庙与黄世仁相遇时，愤怒地举起蜡台砸去。这不单单是向她的一个仇人砸去，而是在向黑暗社会和封建势力砸去，她要打碎那吃人的封建制度，打碎那万恶的旧世界。舞剧《白毛女》这样突出农民的反抗性，完全符合历史的真实。喜儿在八路军解放她的家乡以后，并未因自己获得幸福和惩办了仇人黄世仁就不再进行斗争，而是扛起枪来，继续革命，解救千千万万还在剥削制度下过着非人生活的阶级兄弟，将革命进行到底。这一点使我想到世界上还有三分之二的人民正在受苦受难，我要胸怀祖国，放眼全球，和全世界人民一道，狠狠打击和消灭我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义，直到全世界人民都象喜儿一样获得解放。石景山钢铁厂五好工人张景和在座谈中说，我们无产阶级是硬骨头，从来没有软弱过。解放前，我家的遭遇同“白毛女”一样。我从八岁进厂当童工起，就跟日本鬼子斗。资本家压迫我们，我们要活下去，就得斗争。他激动地对演员们说：看这个剧，真痛快，你们懂得我们工人的心！
    上海市舞蹈学校师生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，把那些洋才子、洋佳人统统赶跑，让无产阶级、劳动人民作为主人公登上社会主义的芭蕾艺术舞台。
    上海市舞蹈学校师生高举毛泽东思想红旗，发扬敢破敢立的革命精神，向资产阶级“专家”、“权威”奉为“神圣不可侵犯的圣物”——外国古典芭蕾展开进攻，创造出革命现代芭蕾舞剧，使芭蕾艺术获得新的生命，博得了广大工农兵的热烈赞扬。他们说：过去的芭蕾舞是资产阶级贩卖毒素的一个阵地，什么《天鹅湖》、《吉赛尔》……都是些腐朽、没落、反动的洋玩意儿，我们根本不想瞅它一眼，压根儿讨厌。多少年来，资产阶级“专家”、“权威”竟把这种东西吹捧为“至高无上”的“艺术顶峰”，说它不可触动，更不能超越，把它原封不动地搬上舞台，来毒化革命人民，从精神上“挖社会主义的墙脚”。在舞蹈艺术的这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，上海市舞蹈学校师生们没有被资产阶级“权威”的反动论调吓倒，勇敢地打破“洋框框”，坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向和“外为中用”，“古为今用”的原则，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，把那些洋才子、洋佳人统统赶跑，让无产阶级、劳动人民作为主人公登上社会主义的芭蕾艺术舞台，让革命人民的斗争生活代替封建社会王子、公主和资产阶级的谈情说爱，成为革命芭蕾舞剧的全新内容。这是演员和编导同志们突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的成果，是继《红色娘子军》以后芭蕾革命的又一巨大胜利。全国人民代表大会代表、“二七”老工人陈发在同演员座谈中激动地说：“你们有志气！你们演的这个戏，有革命气派！我们工人阶级为你们敢于从根本上把芭蕾舞改造成为人民的艺术财富，感到无比骄傲，无比自豪！”许多工农观众还用他们在生产战线上坚持自力更生所取得的巨大成就，鼓励演员们说：我们中国人民就得有志气，外国人有的我们一定要有，外国人没有的我们也要有，资产阶级“专家”不让破的我们要坚决破。我们在工农业方面树立了“大庆”、“大寨”式的好样板，同样要在文化艺术方面树立许多象《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》这样的好样板，拿给那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”们看看，给帝国主义、现代修正主义分子看看，告诉他们：我们在当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，什么奇迹都能创造，什么顽固的堡垒都能攻破！你们的艺术实践已经证明了毛泽东思想战无不胜、攻无不克的强大的威力，证明了无产阶级文化革命大军只要坚持毛主席的文艺方向，就没有拿不下的堡垒，没有攻占不了的阵地。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在民族化、群众化以及作曲、音乐和舞台美术等方面，都是好样的，都有新的发展和创造。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，不仅从政治标准上热烈赞扬舞剧《白毛女》的思想内容，同时，他们对这一革命芭蕾艺术的新形式、新技巧也作了很高的评价。他们认为，这出舞剧在民族化、群众化以及作曲、音乐和舞台美术等方面都是好样的，都有新的发展和创造。
    北京金属结构厂工人李虹等说，舞剧《白毛女》不仅保持了芭蕾舞蹈动作大、跳跃性强等特长，保留了旋转、足尖舞等许多难度很高的动作和独舞、双人舞、群舞等基本形式，而且创造了新的舞蹈语言和表演手法。它成功地运用了我国戏曲和传统的民族舞蹈动作，使芭蕾艺术民族化、群众化。他们说，这出舞剧，真是舞中有戏，戏中有舞，一切从生活出发，一切从内容出发；它根本不同于有些外来的古典芭蕾，这些芭蕾光磨脚尖，为舞而舞，为艺术而艺术，常常变成脱离内容和人物性格的纯技术表演。
    许多工农兵观众举出这出舞剧中最精采的场面之一——第七场大春和喜儿重逢的双人舞说，这段情节和人物的内心活动特别丰富感人：喜儿起初误把大春当作黄世仁的狗腿子，愤怒对抗，后来认出是亲人，又悲又喜；直到跟乡亲们见面，迎着红太阳走出了黑山洞。演员们恰当地运用托举动作和自己创造的新芭蕾舞蹈语汇，十分完美地把它表现出来，真不容易。许多人说，这场戏把我们的心都扣住了。
    舞剧《白毛女》打破古典芭蕾舞剧只跳不唱的死套套，在运用舞蹈动作刻划人物的基础上，大胆地加了二十首具有鲜明的民族风格的独唱、合唱等伴唱，创造了芭蕾舞剧载歌载舞的新形式，特别受到工农兵观众的热烈欢迎。他们认为，这出舞剧加了伴唱，能够更好地表现戏剧内容，更突出了人物性格，更好地塑造了人物形象，同时也更能帮助观众理解剧情，让观众听得清楚，看得明白。北京国棉一厂工人王国荫说，由于舞蹈和伴唱和谐地统一在一起，使喜儿的形象显得有血有肉，非常丰满。在关键时刻，一曲高歌，充分展现了喜儿的精神世界，使我们更加接近喜儿，和她心贴着心。她还说：喜儿带着满身鞭痕，怀着满腔怒火逃出黄家，伴唱者唱出“我要活，我要报仇……”，这歌声把我们的心都震动了。这不是在歌唱，而是喜儿用全身力量在控诉，在呼喊，充分表现了喜儿的坚强性格和复仇的怒火。许多工农兵观众都说：喜儿和乡亲们翻身解放时的伴唱：“太阳出来了，太阳出来了，太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党”，不仅唱出了喜儿，也唱出了我们对党、对毛主席的无限热爱。
