    How Did Lu Ping Serve the "Three-Family Village"?
    Lu Zhanhui, Chen Zhenhan, Zhou Yuzhong, Zhang Renwu, Biology Department of Peking University
    Before Deng Tuo was exposed, Lu Ping never mentioned Wu Han's anti-Party crimes, attempting to protect Wu Han. After Deng Tuo was exposed, he staged a farce of sacrificing "pawns" to protect "generals," attempting to exonerate Deng Tuo from his anti-Party crimes. These facts fully demonstrate that Lu Ping was a loyal running dog of the "Three-Family Village" black shop.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a vigorous socialist cultural revolution has unfolded across the country. Only at Peking University, controlled by the anti-Party element Lu Ping, did things remain stagnant. Until April 16th of this year, Lu Ping did not mention Wu Han's political problems, but repeatedly emphasized things like "honest officials" and "corrupt officials." This was entirely in accordance with his master Deng Tuo's intentions, to lead students into "academic" discussions and protect Wu Han.
    How can a mantis stop a chariot! The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and all revolutionary masses had long stripped away Wu Han's disguise as an "authority" and "scholar," thoroughly exposing Wu Han's counter-revolutionary true face. Not only that, even Deng Tuo, the owner of the "Three-Family Village," was about to be exposed. At this time, Lu Ping, according to the "Three-Family Village's" trick of sacrificing "pawns" to protect "generals," collaborated with the *Beijing Daily* to direct a "Zhou Yu beating Huang Gai" farce. Comrades, please look at the following facts.
    The long-silent Peking University Party Committee suddenly became active on April 16th. In order to peddle the black goods of the April 16th *Beijing Daily*, the university Party Committee convened a meeting of Party members at six o'clock in the morning to "instruct": "Today's *Beijing Daily* has an important article, please study it carefully and pay attention to collecting mass reactions, and distribute the newspaper to you as soon as it arrives." As good as their word, the Peking University Party Committee was unprecedentedly "active" for the first time, distributing the *Beijing Daily* to students at eight o'clock in the morning, and arranging for some comrades doing political work to organize discussions immediately. The "momentum" and "impetus" were truly unprecedented! As everyone knows, the materials published in the *Beijing Daily* on April 16th and the editor's note of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* were a big conspiracy and a big deception. The Peking University Party Committee under Lu Ping's control, however, touted this newspaper as a "positive and important article," which fully demonstrates that Lu Ping was a loyal running dog of the "Three-Family Village" black shop!
    Also on the afternoon of April 16th, Lu Ping presided over the first all-school criticism meeting against Wu Han since the Cultural Revolution. Did Lu Ping really want to stand up in the Cultural Revolution? No, definitely not! Criticizing Wu Han was fake; deceiving the masses, protecting Deng Tuo, and resisting the socialist Cultural Revolution was real.
    At this meeting, Lu Ping personally came forward and asked us to "carefully read the April 16th *Beijing Daily*." Wasn't this to make us believe the nonsense in the editor's note of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* that Wu Han was the "commander," Liao Mosha was the "general," and Deng Tuo was just a small pawn who made mistakes in confusion? Isn't this another ironclad proof of protecting the chief general Deng Tuo after Wu Han was exposed? No wonder the *Beijing Daily* could not wait to report Lu Ping's "important speech" at the mass meeting at Peking University the next day. Look, how closely they cooperated!
    Also at this meeting, Lu Ping described the issue of "rehabilitating unjust verdicts" for Hai Rui, which he personally guided some teachers and students of the Law Department to investigate 1,500 volumes of books and 14 million words of materials under Deng Tuo's instructions, as being "correct" in direction and "correct" in method. This was clearly still trying to lead us into piles of ancient books, to pull the criticism of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist political issues to "academic" issues, and to provide cover for Deng Tuo. Also at this meeting, Lu Ping also uniquely proposed the road of combining leaders, teachers, and students, and emphasized that it should be "resolutely implemented in future struggles." When linked to his repeated obstruction of students' revolutionary demands to go to factories and the countryside, isn't this opposing the road of intellectuals combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers proposed by Chairman Mao? This is completely running counter to the correct path proposed by the Party Central Committee.
    Lu Ping was busy all day and still feared that things were not proper. The next day, April 17th, he hurriedly convened the first all-school Party member meeting since the Cultural Revolution, openly declaring that this was a mobilization meeting "on the issue of academic criticism." Isn't this blatantly attempting to drag all Party members of Peking University with him to bring this life-and-death political struggle of the Cultural Revolution into academic issues? Fearing that his appeal was not strong enough, he brought out the banners of the "Beijing Municipal Party Committee" and the *Beijing Daily*, repeatedly emphasizing the need to "thoroughly understand the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and the Higher Education Party Committee," to "carefully study and discuss" the "criticism" materials and editor's notes published by the *Beijing Daily*," and that "Party members and cadres should take the lead," and so on. Lu Ping desperately emphasized the need to closely follow the spirit of the "Municipal Party Committee" and the "Higher Education Party Committee." Isn't this clearly wanting our broad masses and Party members and cadres to follow the traitor Deng Tuo and the anti-Party element Song Shuo? What Lu Ping did was so rampant and insidious!
    By April 22nd, the Peking University Party Committee under Lu Ping's control had gone even further than the *Beijing Daily* in highlighting Wu Han and protecting Deng Tuo. Lu Ping used his propaganda machine to convey at all levels that "Wu Han is a cutting-edge representative figure of anti-Party and anti-socialism," and that "the criticism of Wu Han should be placed in the entire socialist Cultural Revolution," and so on. Furthermore, in the face of the strong demands of the broad masses of students to criticize Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, the Party Committee under Lu Ping's control repeatedly issued prohibitions, asking everyone to "concentrate their fire on criticizing Wu Han," and said that "this is the spirit of the Central Committee." Articles criticizing Deng Tuo written by students were suppressed, and the revolutionary demands of the masses were criticized. Everyone, see, this Lu Ping, who has always advocated that "Wu Han's problem is an academic problem," has now become a cutting-edge figure against Wu Han. Isn't there clearly something fishy here? The ghost is none other than the "Three-Family Village" gang member Lu Ping, under the instructions of his master, directing a farce of sacrificing "pawns" to protect "generals," and singing a counter-tune to the Cultural Revolution personally led by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!
    The above facts fully demonstrate that Lu Ping, who hangs the sign of "Party Secretary" of Peking University, is a member of the "Three-Family Village" black shop. In the socialist Cultural Revolution, he held up the banner of "closely following the Party Central Committee" while engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities! He vainly attempts to put up a desperate resistance, hold on to the reactionary fortress, and resist the Cultural Revolution. However, this is absolutely impossible to succeed. We, the revolutionary youth of Peking University armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand up and sweep away all monsters and demons!

    陆平是怎样为“三家村”效劳的？
    北京大学生物系　陆占慧　陈贞汉　周裕忠　张壬午
    陆平在邓拓被揪出来前，只字不提吴晗的反党罪行，企图保护吴晗过关。他在邓拓被揪出来后，又导演了一出牺牲“车马”保护“将帅”的丑剧，企图为邓拓开脱反党的罪责。这些事实充分说明，陆平地地道道是“三家村”黑店的忠实走狗。
    在党中央和毛主席的领导下，全国开展了一场轰轰烈烈的社会主义文化大革命。唯独在反党分子陆平把持下的北京大学按兵不动。直到今年四月十六日以前，陆平对吴晗的政治问题只字不提，而反复强调什么“清官”呀，“贪官”呀。这完全是按照他的主子邓拓旨意，把同学引到“学术”讨论中去，保护吴晗过关。
    螳臂怎能挡车！广大工农兵群众及一切革命群众早已把吴晗“权威”“学者”的画皮剥下来了，吴晗的反革命的真面目彻底暴露了。不仅如此，就连“三家村”掌柜邓拓眼看也要被揪了出来。这时，陆平又按“三家村”牺牲“车马”保护“将帅”的诡计，配合《北京日报》导演了一出“周瑜打黄盖”的丑剧。请同志们看看下面的事实吧。
    沉闷已久的北大党委，在四月十六日突然积极起来了。为了兜售四月十六日《北京日报》的黑货，校党委在早晨六点钟就召集党员开会“指示”说：“今天《北京日报》有重要文章，请大家认真学习，并注意收集群众反应，报纸来了马上发给你们。”说到做到，北大党委破天荒第一次这样“积极”，在早晨八点多钟就把《北京日报》发到同学手中，并布置一些做政治工作的同志马上组织讨论。“声势”之大，“气势”之猛，真是空前！众所周知，《北京日报》四月十六日发表的材料和《前线》、《北京日报》编者按是个大阴谋、大骗局。陆平把持下的北大党委，却把这份报纸作为“正面的重要文章”大加宣扬，这不是充分说明了陆平地地道道是“三家村”黑店的忠实走狗吗！
    也就在四月十六日下午，陆平主持了文化大革命以来的第一次全校批判吴晗大会。陆平真地要站到文化大革命中来吗？不，决不是！批判吴晗是假，欺骗群众、保护邓拓、抗拒社会主义文化大革命是真。
    在这次大会上，陆平亲自出马，让我们“认真读读四月十六日《北京日报》”。这不就是要让我们相信《前线》《北京日报》编者按所说的吴晗是“主帅”，廖沫沙是“主将”，而邓拓则不过只是一名小卒，他不过是稀里糊涂地犯了错误的鬼话吗？这不就是在吴晗被揪出后，保护主将邓拓过关的又一铁证吗？难怪第二天《北京日报》迫不及待地报道了陆平在北京大学群众大会上的“重要讲话”。请看，他们一唱一和配合得多么紧密啊。
    就是在这次大会上，陆平又把在邓拓指使下自己亲身指导法律系部分师生查了一千五百卷书和一千四百万字的资料研究一个海瑞的“平冤狱”的问题，说成是方向“对头”、方法“正确”。这明明是还要把我们引到古书堆中去，把批判邓拓反党反社会主义的政治问题往“学术”问题上拉，为邓拓打掩护。也就是在这次大会上，陆平还独出心裁地提出了领导、教师、同学三结合这条道路，并强调在“今后斗争中坚决执行”。这和他百般阻挠同学下厂下乡的革命要求联系起来，不就是与毛主席所提出的知识分子与工农兵相结合的道路相对抗吗？这完全是与党中央提出的正确道路背道而驰的。
    陆平忙了一天，还怕事情不妥。第二天即四月十七日晚上，他又急急忙忙召开了文化大革命以来第一次全校党员大会，公开宣称这是“关于学术批判问题”动员大会。这不是明目张胆地企图拉着北大的全体党员跟他一起把这场文化大革命你死我活的政治斗争带到学术问题中去吗？他生怕自己的号召力还不强，就又搬出了“北京市委”和《北京日报》的招牌，反复强调要“吃透中央、北京市委和高教党委的指示精神”，要对“《北京日报》公布的“批判”材料和编者按语认真学习、讨论”，“党员和干部要带头”，等等。陆平拼命强调要紧跟“市委”“高教党委”精神，这不是明明白白地要让我们广大群众和党员干部跟叛徒邓拓走，跟反党分子宋硕走吗？陆平所干的勾当是何等猖狂和阴险啊！
    到四月二十二日，陆平把持的北京大学党委在突出吴晗、保护邓拓方面比《北京日报》走得更远了。陆平利用他的宣传机器层层下达，说什么“吴晗是反党反社会主义的尖端性代表人物”，要“把批判吴晗放在整个社会主义文化大革命中去”，等等。并且在广大同学强烈要求批判邓拓反党反社会主义罪行的情况下，陆平把持的党委却一再下达禁令，要大家“集中火力批判吴晗”，并说“这是中央精神”。同学们写出的批判邓拓的文章遭到扣压，群众的革命要求受到指责。大家看，这个一贯宣扬“吴晗的问题是学术问题”的陆平，现在居然成了反吴晗的尖端人物，这里不是明明有鬼吗？鬼不是别的，鬼就是“三家村”黑帮分子陆平在他的主子指示下，导演了一场牺牲“车马”保护“将帅”的丑剧，与党中央、毛主席亲自领导的文化大革命唱对台戏！
    以上事实充分说明，挂着北京大学“党委书记”招牌的陆平，是“三家村”黑店的一员。他在社会主义文化大革命中，打着“紧跟党中央”的旗号，干着反党反社会主义的勾当！他妄图负隅顽抗，坚守反动堡垒，对抗文化大革命。但是，这是绝对不能得逞的。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的北京大学的革命青年，坚决挺身而出，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神！
