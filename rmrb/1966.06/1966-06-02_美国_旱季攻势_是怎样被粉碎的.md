      "The Viet Cong's rainy season is over!" "Our dry season has arrived!" "Exploit our land and air superiority to change the situation in the dry season!" This was the frantic noise shouted by the American aggressors at the end of last year, and the delirious ravings of the American aggressors who were being beaten into a state of panic by the South Vietnamese people!
    Last spring and summer, under the heavy blows of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, the U.S.-puppet troops suffered extremely惨重的failures on the South Vietnamese battlefield. In order to reverse the defeat, from July of last year, the American aggressors rapidly increased their invading army in South Vietnam from more than 60,000 to more than 200,000. The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, under the instruction of the Pentagon, personally formulated a new "five-point" strategic plan.
    In order to implement this plan, starting from the end of last year, the American aggressors concentrated almost all of its strategic mobile forces in South Vietnam to launch one large-scale and protracted "dry season offensive" after another against the Central Highlands region of South Vietnam, the guerrilla areas and liberated areas in the Fifth Interzone from Quang Ngai Province to the north of Phu Yen Province, and the areas around Saigon.
    The American "dry season offensive" was officially launched with more than 40,000 American aggressors, a large number of puppet troops, and mercenary troops simultaneously launching "five major strategic strikes" against areas around Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Saigon. In coordination with this, the American aggressors also launched many medium and small-scale "sweeps" against the plain areas of Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces, as well as the strategic transportation routes in the Southern Eastern Zone and the Southern Western Zone, in an attempt to disperse the Liberation Army's forces, forcing them to compete with them on these major and minor battlefields, in order to achieve the goal of annihilating the Liberation Army one by one.
    In southern Quang Ngai province, the U.S. Marines advanced into Mo Duc and Duc Pho. However, as soon as they arrived, they were immediately plunged into a sea of guerrilla warfare and thousands of them were annihilated. While this U.S. Marine Corps was being beaten everywhere and passively coping with the situation, the Liberation Army and guerrillas in Quang Ngai Province, with extremely swift momentum, cut off Highway 1 from Son Tinh to Chu Lai, forcing the enemy to divert troops to rescue it. However, the Son Tinh northwest battlefield was a battlefield that the Liberation Army had already chosen, and according to the predetermined plan, the Liberation Army transferred the enemy to Dong Giap and Hill 62, annihilated two battalions and four companies of the U.S. Marine Corps in one fell swoop, and quickly defeated the reinforcements sent by the enemy to "relieve" Highway 1.
    In northern Binh Dinh Province, the unprecedented and longest large-scale sweep launched by the U.S. aggressors from January 28 to March 7 also turned into an unprecedented and disastrous failure for the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. In this battle alone, 9,166 enemies were eliminated, including 5,160 American aggressors; 374 enemy planes were shot down or damaged, and 30 tanks were destroyed.
    Around Saigon, the American aggressors continuously launched many large "sweeps" against Duc Hoa and Duc Hue in Bien Hoa Province, Cu Chi in Gia Dinh Province, and Vung Tau and Rung Sat in Ba Ria Province. However, the guerrilla warfare of the people in various places has caused this series of "sweeps" by the American aggressors to have also suffered shameful failures. It should be particularly pointed out that in the so-called "Rolling Stone" offensive launched by the American bandits, as soon as the American aggressors moved out, the Liberation Army gave the enemy a heavy blow in the D war zone with lightning speed, completely annihilating two battalions and their headquarters of the 1st Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, in addition to completely annihilating two U.S. armored battalions, and inflicting heavy casualties on an Australian battalion. In this battle, the Liberation Army made brilliant achievements, making the enemy's defense line north and northwest of Saigon even more seriously threatened.
    Just as the main force of the American aggressors was exhausted, battered, and suffered heavy casualties everywhere, the Liberation Armed Forces continuously and actively launched fierce offensives for a long time in the vital areas of Quang Ngai and Thua Thien, surrounding and severely attacking the invaders' strongholds in Phu Bai and Phong Dien in Thua Thien Province, the western part of Quang Nam Province, the northwestern part of Quang Ngai Province, and many strongholds in the provinces of Rach Gia, Can Tho, Tan An, Cholon, and Soc Trang, eliminating a large number of enemy effectives. The Liberation Armed Forces also actively attacked the enemy on the transportation lines of Quang Ngai, My Tho, and Binh Thuan provinces, sank enemy ships on the Saigon River, and inserted themselves behind enemy lines to attack the American aggressors' military bases in Chu Lai, An Khe, Vung Tau, Tan Son Nhut, etc., and the puppet troops' bases in Hue, Quang Nam, Ben Tre, Ba Ria, Saigon, etc. with thunderous force. At this point, the "dry season offensive" launched by the American aggressors has been completely bankrupted under the heavy blows of the Liberation Armed Forces. Even Westmoreland, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, had to tremble in fear and lament that "the coming months will be the hard months in this war." "There are already various indications that the other side will actively launch an offensive in the rainy season, and the other side will be strengthened this rainy season than last year...." On the South Vietnamese battlefield, an even greater惨败 is awaiting the American aggressors!

### 美国“旱季攻势”是怎样被粉碎的

    美国“旱季攻势”是怎样被粉碎的
      “越共的雨季过去了！”“我们的旱季到来了！”“发挥陆空优势，旱季改观战局！”这是美国侵略者去年年底声嘶力竭喊出的哇哇噪音，也是被南越人民打得丧魂失魄的美国侵略者的梦呓！
    去年春季和夏季，在南越人民武装力量的沉重打击下，美伪军在南越战场上遭到了极其惨重的失败。为了扭转败局，从去年七月起，美国侵略者把它在南越的侵略军迅速地从六万多人增加至二十多万人。侵越美军总司令威斯特摩兰根据五角大楼的指示，亲自制订了一个新的“五点”战略计划。
    为了实现这个计划，美国侵略者从去年年底开始，几乎集中了它在南越的全部战略机动力量，对南越西原地区、从广义省到富安省北部的第五联区的平原游击区和解放区，以及西贡周围等地区，发动了一个紧接一个的大规模和长时间的“旱季攻势”。
    美国的“旱季攻势”，是以四万多名美国侵略军，大批伪军、仆从军，同时对广义、平定、富安和西贡周围等地区发动“五大战略打击”而正式揭开序幕的。与这相配合，美国侵略者还对广治和承天省的平原地区，以及南部东区和南部西区的战略交通路线发动了许多次中、小规模的“扫荡”，妄图以此分散解放军的力量，使解放军被迫在上述这些主要和非主要战场上与他们较量，以便达到一个个吃掉解放军的目的。
    在广义省南部，美国海军陆战队进犯慕德和德普。但是，他们一到，立即就陷入游击战的火海里，被歼灭了成千人。正当这支美国海军陆战队到处挨打、被动应付之际，广义省的解放军和游击队，以极其迅猛之势，切断了从山靖通向朱莱的第一号公路，迫使敌人不得不抽调兵力赶往救援。但是，山靖西北战场是解放军早就选择好了的战场，解放军按照预定计划，把敌人调动至东甲和六二高地，一举全歼了美国海军陆战队两个营又四个连，并迅速地击溃了敌人为第一号公路“解围”而派来的援军。
    在平定省北部，美国侵略军从一月二十八日至三月七日所发动的规模空前、为时最久的一次大扫荡，也变成了美国侵略军及其走狗所遭到的空前惨重的失败。仅此一仗，就消灭了九千一百六十六个敌人，其中包括五千一百六十个美国侵略者；击落击伤敌机三百七十四架，击毁战车三十辆。
    在西贡周围，美国侵略者对堤岸省的德和、德惠，嘉定省的古芝，巴地省的头顿、浔巴等地连续发动了多次大“扫荡”。但是，各地人民的游击战争，使美国侵略者这一连串的“扫荡”也已遭到可耻的失败。特别应该指出，在美国强盗发动的所谓“滚石”攻势中，美国侵略军一出动，解放军就以迅雷不及掩耳之势，在D战区给予敌人以狠狠的打击，全歼美国第一步兵师第一旅的两个营及其司令部，此外还全歼美军两个装甲营，并使一个澳大利亚营遭到沉重伤亡。这一仗，解放军立下了辉煌的战功，使敌人在西贡北面和西北面的防线受到更加严重的威胁。
    正当美国侵略军的主力由于处处挨打、疲惫不堪、伤亡惨重的时候，解放武装力量却连续、主动地在广义、承天等要冲地区，发动长时间的猛烈进攻，包围并沉重地打击了侵略者在承天省的富牌、丰田据点和广南省西部、广义省西北部以及迪石、芹苴、新安、堤岸、朔庄等省的许多据点，消灭了敌人大量有生力量。解放武装力量还主动袭击了广义、美萩、平顺等省交通线上的敌人，击沉了敌人在西贡河上的舰艇，并插入敌后，以雷霆万钧之势，袭击了美国侵略者在朱莱、安溪、头顿、新山一等的军事基地和伪军在顺化、广南、槟椥、巴地、西贡等的基地。至此，美国侵略者所发动的“旱季攻势”在解放武装力量的沉重打击下已彻底破产。甚至侵越美军总司令威斯特摩兰也不得不胆战心惊地哀叹，“即将到来的几个月将是这场战争中艰苦的几个月。”已“有种种迹象表明，对方将在雨季中主动发动进攻，今年雨季对方将比去年得到增强……。”在南越战场上，更大的惨败正在等待着美国侵略者！
