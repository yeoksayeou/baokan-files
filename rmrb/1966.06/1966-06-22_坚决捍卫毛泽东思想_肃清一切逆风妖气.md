    All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to run rampant freely.
    Resolutely Defend Mao Zedong Thought, Sweep Away All Counter-Current Evil Winds
    Zhang Wannian, Commander of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" and Participant in the Xin Kai Ling Battle

    Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged." "Facing the Wind for a Thousand Li" sings a completely opposite tune, portraying the people's war led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao as a war without the support and assistance of the masses. Throughout the film, one does not see scenes of the people actively cooperating with the troops to strike at the enemy, nor does one see scenes of the people warmly supporting their own soldiers. The only masses seen are either panicking, terrified, and fleeing before the enemy, or obsequiously calling the enemy "officials" and "bosses." What is particularly infuriating is that after our army arrives at "Hulu Tao," not even a single basic member of the masses can be found, portraying the People's Liberation Army as a "lone army" to whom no one responds no matter how loudly they call. In contrast, the enemy has a certain mass "base" in our controlled areas, and there is even a group of lurking "anti-communist revenge army" engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

    This is a distortion of black and white, the greatest distortion, and the most vicious attack on Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and the people.

    I am an old soldier who participated in the Xin Kai Ling Battle. At that time, I was most aware of the situation of the people actively cooperating with the troops to strike at the enemy and warmly supporting their own soldiers. On the eve of the Xin Kai Ling Battle, when the people heard that we lacked materials for building fortifications, they took the wood and door panels they were going to use to build new houses and actively sent them to our positions. Many old men and women also complained to us about the towering crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and said to us with resentment: "As long as we can eliminate more Chiang Kai-sheks, we are willing to sacrifice our old lives!" As soon as the battle started, the local armed forces and the people, in addition to actively delivering ammunition to the troops, carrying stretchers, and nursing the wounded, also seized every opportunity to actively participate in the battle, set up ambushes, block gaps, and capture prisoners, making significant contributions to the complete annihilation of the enemy's 25th Division.

    It was precisely because we conscientiously implemented the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, and the army and people built a wall of bronze and iron, that after only three days of fierce fighting, we completely and totally annihilated the Kuomintang's so-called "Thousand Li Colt" 25th Division in the Xin Kai Ling area. After the end of the Xin Kai Ling Battle, in order to encourage their soldiers to make persistent efforts to completely eliminate the enemies of the entire Northeast and the entire China, the people actively sent their sons and husbands to join the army. Whether the troops were marching or fighting, day or night, whether it was a strong wind or heavy rain, the people actively led the way for us and sent intelligence. Every time we arrived at a campsite, the local people's government actively helped to raise grain and fodder. There were people when we needed them, and materials when we needed them. The masses regarded the People's Army as their own brothers. For example, one day, our troops arrived in a village in Linjiang late at night, but as soon as the people heard that their own soldiers had arrived, they got up one after another to help boil water and cook food. Old women even helped the soldiers sew clothes and socks overnight. All of this reflected the people's boundless love and enthusiastic support for the People's Army. However, the film "Facing the Wind for a Thousand Li" portrays the people's war led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao as a war without the support and assistance of the masses. Isn't the author's reactionary class stand very clear!

    What kind of tree blossoms what kind of flower, what class speaks what kind of words. The reason why the author of "Facing the Wind for a Thousand Li" wants to viciously attack Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is not accidental. Chairman Mao is the helmsman of the world people's revolution. Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the magic weapon for the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory, and it is also the magic weapon for the world people to seek liberation and make revolution. Imperialism and modern revisionism are most afraid of this magic weapon, therefore, anti-Party and anti-socialist elements desperately oppose it, attack it, and curse it. We are Chairman Mao's good soldiers, with the brightest eyes and the most sensitive sense of smell. We must smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs to pieces! Resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought!

### 坚决捍卫毛泽东思想  肃清一切逆风妖气

    凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥
    坚决捍卫毛泽东思想  肃清一切逆风妖气
    “塔山英雄团”团长、新开岭战斗参加者　张万年
    毛主席英明地指出：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”《逆风千里》大唱反调，把中国共产党和毛主席领导的人民战争，描写成一场没有群众拥护和支援的战争。影片自始至终看不到人民群众积极配合部队打击敌人的场面，也看不到人民群众热烈支援自己的子弟兵的场面。所看到的一些群众，不是在敌人面前惊慌、恐惧、逃亡，就是卑躬屈节地叫敌人“长官”、“老总”，特别使人愤恨的是，当我军来到“葫芦套”以后，连一个基本群众都找不到，把解放军描写成叫天天不应，叫地地不灵的“孤军”。与此相反，敌人在我统治区却有一定群众“基础”，而且还有一批潜伏的“反共复仇军”在进行反革命活动。
    这是颠倒黑白，是最大的歪曲，是对毛主席人民战争思想和人民群众最恶毒的攻击。
    我是参加新开岭战斗的一个老战士。当时，人民积极配合部队打击敌人，热烈支援自己的子弟兵的情况，我是最清楚的。新开岭战斗前夕，老百姓听说我们修筑工事缺乏器材，就将自己要盖新房子用的木材、门板等东西，主动给我们送到阵地上。许多老大爷老大娘，还向我们控诉蒋介石匪帮的滔天罪行，并愤恨地对我们说：“只要能多消灭蒋该死，就是献出我这条老命也甘心情愿！”战斗一打响，地方武装和人民群众，除积极地为部队送弹药，抬担架，护理伤员之外，还抓紧一切机会，主动参加战斗，打阻击，堵口子，抓俘虏，为全歼敌二十五师作出了重大贡献。
    正因为我们认真贯彻了党中央和毛主席人民战争思想，军民筑成铜墙铁壁，所以，只经过三天的激烈战斗，就把国民党号称“千里驹”的二十五师，彻底地、全部地消灭在新开岭地区。新开岭战斗结束之后，人民群众为了鼓舞子弟兵再接再厉，彻底消灭全东北和全中国的敌人，纷纷送自己的儿子和丈夫参军。部队行军、作战，不管白天黑夜，也无论是刮大风下大雨，人民群众都主动地为我们带路，送情报。每到宿营地，当地人民政府就积极帮助筹粮筹草，真是要人有人，要物有物。群众把人民军队看作自己的亲兄弟。比如有一天，我们部队来到临江的一个乡村，已经是深夜时候，但老百姓一听说来了自己的子弟兵，就纷纷起床，帮助烧水，做饭。老大娘还连夜帮助战士缝补衣服和鞋袜。所有这一切，都体现了人民群众对人民军队的无比爱戴和热情支持。而影片《逆风千里》却把共产党和毛主席领导的人民战争，描写成一场没有群众拥护和支援的战争。作者的反动的阶级立场，不是十分清楚吗！
    什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。《逆风千里》的作者之所以要恶毒地攻击毛主席的人民战争思想，并不是偶然的。毛主席是世界人民革命的舵手。毛主席的人民战争思想，是中国人民取得革命胜利的法宝，也是世界人民求解放闹革命的法宝。帝国主义和现代修正主义最害怕这个法宝，因此，反党反社会主义分子，就拼命地反对它，攻击它，咒骂它。我们是毛主席的好战士，眼睛最亮，嗅觉最灵。我们一定要把反党反社会主义的黑帮砸得粉身碎骨！坚决捍卫毛泽东思想！
