    Hail a Big-Character Poster from Peking University
    By Our Commentator
    The big-character poster by Comrade Nie Yuanzi and others has exposed a major conspiracy of the "Three-Family Village" black gang!
    Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village" black den, has been exposed, but this anti-Party clique is not reconciled to its defeat. They are still putting up a last-ditch resistance, using the words of Song Shuo, a member of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party group, to "strengthen leadership and stick to their posts."
    What "posts" are they "sticking to"? They are "sticking to" the reactionary strongholds they have occupied for many years. What "leadership" are they strengthening? It is to direct their accomplices to struggle desperately, trying to maintain their anti-Party and anti-socialist positions.
    Song Shuo's "strengthen leadership" and "stick to their posts" is a signal. It reflects the dynamics of all monsters and demons in this sweeping Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They will not give up an inch, they will fight for every piece of land, and they will not fall unless they are struggled against.
    The "Three-Family Village" black gang is full of tricks. Earlier, they adopted the tactic of "sacrificing pawns to save the king." Now that the "king" has fallen, they are adopting the method of saving as many pawns as possible. They vainly attempt to preserve their strength and wait for an opportunity to act.
    Peking University, which has been controlled for many years by Lu Ping, Peng Peiyun and others, is an important stronghold of the "Three-Family Village" black gang and a stubborn fortress for their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. As late as May 14, Lu Ping was still conveying the so-called emergency instructions from Song Shuo, Deputy Director of the University Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and frantically making arrangements to deceive, mislead, and suppress the vast numbers of young students and revolutionary cadres and teachers, preventing them from responding to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to rise up in revolution. Peng Peiyun is a mysterious figure who scurries around, pulling strings and making connections. In this incident, she went underground, traveling between the dormitory of the History Department of Peking University in the Ming Tombs and Song Shuo and Lu Ping, offering advice and secretly directing.
    All this shows that the branches of the "Three-Family Village" black den and the "pawns" of the "Three-Family Village" black gang are still resisting in a directed, organized, and planned way.
    Lu Ping, in his capacity as "Secretary of the Party Committee" of Peking University, and in the name of the "organization," threatened the students and cadres who rose up in revolution, saying that disobeying the command of their clique was a violation of discipline and an act against the Party. This is a common trick used by the anti-Party elements of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. May we ask Lu Ping, what Party are you talking about? What organization is yours? What discipline is yours? Facts compel us to answer that your "Party" is not a real Communist Party, but a fake Communist Party, a revisionist "Party." Your "organization" is an anti-Party clique. Your discipline is the cruel and ruthless suppression of proletarian revolutionaries.
    Lu Ping's tricks cannot deceive anyone.
    For proletarian revolutionaries, we abide by the discipline of the Chinese Communist Party, and we unconditionally accept the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the supreme instruction for all our work. Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle in socialist society, and his instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in the ideological sphere, are what we must resolutely follow. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, or opposes the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, no matter what banner they fly, no matter how high their position or how old their seniority, they actually represent the interests of the overthrown exploiting classes, and the people of the whole country will rise up against them, overthrow them, and thoroughly destroy their black gangs, black organizations, and black discipline.
    The unprecedented wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history is surging forward. The clowns who try to block this tide are doomed to destruction.
    Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and proletarian cultural fighters are taking counter-revolutionary cultural positions one by one with overwhelming force, destroying counter-revolutionary cultural fortresses. Those "Three-Family Villages" and "Four-Family Villages" are just paper tigers. Their "generals" cannot be saved, and their "pawns" cannot be saved either.
    The proletarian revolutionaries of Peking University will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and will surely unite the masses more powerfully to fight. Those who have not yet seen clearly will quickly raise their awareness and join the ranks of the struggle. The revolutionary struggle of the vast number of teachers and students of Peking University against bourgeois representatives will surely be victorious. A thriving, truly socialist new Peking University will soon appear in the capital of the people.

    欢呼北大的一张大字报
    本报评论员
    聂元梓等同志的大字报，揭穿了“三家村”黑帮分子的一个大阴谋！
    “三家村”黑店的掌柜邓拓被揭露出来了，但是这个反党集团并不甘心自己的失败。他们仍然负隅顽抗，用“三家村”反党集团分子宋硕的话来说，叫作“加强领导，坚守岗位”。
    他们“坚守”的是什么“岗位”？他们“坚守”的是他们多年来一直盘踞的反动堡垒。他们加强的是什么“领导”？就是指挥他们的伙计作垂死挣扎、力图保持他们反党反社会主义的阵地。
    宋硕的“加强领导”，“坚守岗位”，这是一个信号。它反映了在这场摧枯拉朽的无产阶级文化大革命中，一切牛鬼蛇神们的动态。他们是一步不让的，寸土必争的，不斗不倒的。
    “三家村”黑帮是诡计多端的。在前一个时候，他们采取“牺牲车马，保存主帅”的战术。现在“主帅”垮台了，他们就采取能保存多少车马就保存多少车马的手法。他们妄图保存实力，待机而动。
    为陆平、彭珮云等人多年把持的北京大学，是“三家村”黑帮的一个重要据点，是他们反党反社会主义的顽固堡垒。已经到了五月十四日，陆平还传达北京市委大学部副部长宋硕的所谓紧急指示，并手忙脚乱地进行部署，欺骗、蒙蔽和压制广大青年学生和革命干部、革命教师，不许他们响应毛主席和党中央的号召起来革命。彭珮云是一个神秘人物，上窜下跳，拉线搭桥。在这个事件中，她转入地下活动，来往于北京大学历史系住地十三陵和宋硕、陆平之间，出谋划策，秘密指挥。
    这一切，都说明“三家村”黑店的分号，“三家村”黑帮的“车马”们，还是有指挥、有组织、有计划地进行顽抗。
    陆平以北京大学“党委书记”的身份，以“组织”的名义，对起来革命的学生和干部，进行威吓，说什么不听从他们这一撮人的指挥就是违犯纪律，就是反党。这是“三家村”黑帮反党分子们惯用的伎俩。请问陆平，你们所说的党是什么党？你们的组织是什么组织？你们的纪律是什么纪律？事实使我们不能不做出这样的回答，你们的“党”不是真共产党，而是假共产党，是修正主义的“党”。你们的“组织”就是反党集团。你们的纪律就是对无产阶级革命派实行残酷无情的打击。
    陆平们这一套是骗不了人的。
    对于无产阶级革命派来说，我们遵守的是中国共产党的纪律，我们无条件接受的，是以毛主席为首的党中央的领导。毛泽东思想，是我们各项工作的最高指示。毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的学说，关于在意识形态领域中兴无灭资的无产阶级文化大革命的指示，是我们必须坚决遵循的。凡是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席和党中央的指示的，不论他们打着什么旗号，不管他们有多高的职位、多老的资格，他们实际上是代表被打倒了的剥削阶级的利益，全国人民都会起来反对他们，把他们打倒，把他们的黑帮、黑组织、黑纪律彻底摧毁。
    人类历史上空前未有的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮，汹涌澎湃，妄图阻挡这个潮流的小丑们，他们是难逃灭顶之灾的。
    工农兵和无产阶级的文化战士，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，以排山倒海之势，正在一个一个地夺取反革命的文化阵地，摧毁反革命的文化堡垒。那些什么“三家村”、“四家村”，不过是纸老虎，他们的“将帅”保不住，他们的“车马”也同样是保不住的。
    北京大学的无产阶级革命派，一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定能够更加有力地团结群众进行战斗。一时还看不清楚的人们，一定会迅速地提高自己的觉悟，参加到战斗的行列中来。北京大学广大师生的反对资产阶级代表人物的革命斗争，一定能够胜利。一个欣欣向荣的真正的社会主义的新北大，一定会很快地出现在人民的首都。
