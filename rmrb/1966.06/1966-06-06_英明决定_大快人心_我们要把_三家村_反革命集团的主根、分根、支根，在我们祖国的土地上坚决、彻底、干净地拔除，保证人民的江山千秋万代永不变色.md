    A Brilliant Decision, Immensely Satisfying
    We must resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly uproot the main root, branch roots, and twig roots of the "Three-Family Village" anti-revolutionary group from the land of our motherland, to ensure that the people's Jiangshan never changes color for generations to come.
    Feng Fusheng, Instructor of a Unit of the Air Force on the Fujian Front

    The news of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision to reorganize the Beijing Municipal Party Committee fills me with immense excitement. This is a great victory for the people and the broad masses of cadres in Beijing, a great victory for the people of the whole country, and a great victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought. As a People's Liberation Army soldier, I fully support this brilliant and correct decision of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.
    The former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, being situated close to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, has for a long time failed to implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and has failed to implement the correct line of Marxism-Leninism. They have used the powers given to them by the Party and the people to implement an anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. They controlled many departments and schools of the Beijing municipal party and government organs, controlled newspapers and periodicals, did not promote the great Mao Zedong Thought, did not cultivate proletarian revolutionary successors, but promoted a revisionist line, spread the decadent bourgeois poison, and vainly attempted to carry out capitalist restoration in our country, change the color of our country, and drag us back to the old society, making us slaves of the landlords and capitalists again. These bourgeois schemers have now been thoroughly exposed, which is truly a great and satisfying good thing.
      "Three-Family Village" is an anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary group. "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" have become their counter-revolutionary tools. For a long time, they have viciously attacked our great Party and Chairman Mao, and slandered the great Mao Zedong Thought. How could they be so insane? Now it is clear that they have a backstage supporter, a backer, and roots. This root is the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Their backstage boss is the main person in charge of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. These are representative figures who have sneaked into our Party and seized important Party positions. They are revisionists and anti-Party conspirators. The facts of the class struggle are so startling. We cannot but express our utmost indignation towards these anti-Party and anti-socialist schemers.
    Under the brilliant leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the impact of the worker-peasant-soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, these counter-revolutionary black gangs have been completely exposed to the light of day. We, the worker-peasant-soldier masses, must hold higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, and resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly uproot the main root, branch roots, and twig roots of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary group from the socialist land of our motherland, to ensure that our people's Jiangshan never changes color for generations to come. "We should pursue the tottering foe with power to spare." We must pursue and strike hard, directly attacking the lair of the counter-revolutionary black gang, and drag them all out, and never let them slip away.
    Chairman Mao said long ago that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, which look terrible, but are actually nothing great. The anti-Party and anti-socialist counter-revolutionary group is also like this, no matter who they are, no matter how high their position, how famous their reputation, how old their qualifications, or how great their prestige, no matter when or where, as long as they oppose the brilliant, great, and correct Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight them to the end. These anti-Party and anti-socialist groups will certainly be crushed and buried under the blows of the worker-peasant-soldier masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Their names will be infamous for ten thousand years.
    We must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works even more diligently in a living way, stand at the forefront of the Socialist Cultural Revolution, and fight to the end to defend Mao Zedong Thought.

    英明决定　大快人心
    我们要把“三家村”反革命集团的主根、分根、支根，在我们祖国的土地上坚决、彻底、干净地拔除，保证人民的江山千秋万代永不变色

    中共中央决定改组北京市委的消息传来，我感到万分振奋。这是北京市人民和广大干部的大胜利，是全国人民的大胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。作为一个解放军战士，我完全拥护党中央和毛主席这个英明、正确的决定。
    前北京市委，他们身在党中央和毛主席的身边，长期以来不执行党中央和毛主席的指示，不执行马克思列宁主义的正确路线，他们利用党和人民给他们的职权，贯彻执行一条反党反社会主义的黑线。他们把持了北京市党政机关的许多部门、学校，把持着报纸刊物，不宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，不培养无产阶级革命接班人，而推行修正主义路线，散布腐朽的资产阶级毒素，妄图在我国进行资本主义复辟，改变我们国家的颜色，把我们拉回到旧社会去，让我们重新给地主资本家做牛马。这些资产阶级的阴谋家，现在被彻底揭穿了，这真是一件大快人心的大好事。
      “三家村”是反党反社会主义的反革命集团，《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》变成了他们手中的反革命工具，他们长期以来恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党和毛主席，污蔑伟大的毛泽东思想。他们怎么能这样疯狂呢？现在清楚了，他们有后台，有靠山，有根子。这个根子就是前北京市委。他们的后台老板就是前北京市委的主要负责人。这是一些混到我们党内，窃踞了党的重要职权的代表人物，他们是修正主义分子，是反党阴谋家。阶级斗争的事实，多么惊心动魄。对这些反党反社会主义的阴谋家，我们不能不表示万分的愤慨。
    在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众的冲击下，这些反革命的黑帮彻底暴露于光天化日之下了。我们工农兵群众，一定更高举起毛泽东思想红旗，团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，乘胜前进，把“三家村”反党反社会主义反革命集团的主根、分根、支根，在我们祖国社会主义的土地上，坚决、彻底、干净地拔除，保证我们人民的江山千秋万代永不变色。“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，我们一定穷追猛打，直捣反革命黑帮的巢穴，把他们全部揪出来，决不能让他们滑掉。
    毛主席早就说过，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并没有什么了不起。反党反社会主义的反革命集团也是这样，不管他们是些什么人，有多高的职位，多响的名声，多老的资格，多大的威风，不管在什么时候，什么地方，只要他们反对英明、伟大、正确的毛泽东思想，我们就要和他们斗到底。这些反党反社会主义集团一定会在毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众打击下，被粉碎！被埋葬！他们的名字将遗臭万年。
    我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加勤奋地活学活用毛主席著作，站在社会主义文化大革命的前列，为捍卫毛泽东思想战斗到底。
