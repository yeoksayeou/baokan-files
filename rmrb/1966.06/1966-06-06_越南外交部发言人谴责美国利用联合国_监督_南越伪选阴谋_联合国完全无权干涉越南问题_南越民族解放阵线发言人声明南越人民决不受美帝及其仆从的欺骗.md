    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, authorized to issue a statement on the 4th regarding the U.S.-puppet clique's attempt to use the United Nations to "supervise" the so-called "elections" held by the South Vietnamese puppet regime, pointed out that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam question. All U.N. decisions concerning the Vietnam question are completely invalid.

    The statement pointed out that in order to save the thoroughly corrupt puppet regime and give it a veneer of legitimacy, the United States and its running dogs intend to play an "election" farce, attempting to piece together a so-called "legitimate government" in South Vietnam. The so-called "elections" held under the guns of 260,000 U.S. invading troops, more than 500,000 South Vietnamese puppet troops, and the armies of U.S. accomplices are nothing more than a blatant fraud. Precisely for this reason, the United States and its running dogs are plotting to bring in U.N. "observers" to "supervise" this "election," attempting to use the U.N.'s signboard to "legitimize" this puppet clique in international public opinion. At the same time, they also intend to pave the way for U.N. interference in the Vietnam question and to utilize the U.N. to serve the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns and protests the above-mentioned vicious conspiracy of the U.S. government and its running dogs to world peace-loving public opinion.

    The statement said that the United Nations has absolutely no right to interfere in the Vietnam question. The Saigon puppet regime's suggestion, under the orders of the United States, to invite the U.N. to send "observers" to South Vietnam to supervise the "election" farce is completely illegal and violates the 1954 Geneva Accords on the Vietnam question, and is a violation of international law. The U.N.'s decision to send "observers" to South Vietnam in September to "supervise" the deceptive "elections," as well as all other U.N. decisions regarding the Vietnam question, are completely invalid.

    The statement said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that countries inside and outside the United Nations that love peace and uphold justice will resolutely expose and condemn the above-mentioned tactics of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The U.S. government must recognize the four points of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; must stop the war of aggression against Vietnam; must withdraw U.S. and its lackey troops and weapons from South Vietnam, and allow the people of South Vietnam to resolve the internal affairs of South Vietnam themselves in accordance with the program of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front; and the U.S. government must stop the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is the only correct way to resolve the Vietnam question. There is no other way.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 5th, according to a report by the Vietnam News Agency: The spokesman for the Foreign Liaison Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, authorized on the 4th, issued a statement strongly condemning the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique to use the United Nations to "supervise" the sham "elections" to be held in South Vietnam.

    The statement pointed out that the so-called "elections" that the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique was forced to agree to hold are merely a deceptive action to appease the people of South Vietnamese cities who are resolutely struggling to overthrow the puppet regime. When 300,000 U.S. invading troops and their accomplice armies are openly occupying South Vietnam and carrying out an extremely brutal war of aggression there, the "elections" they hold in South Vietnam cannot be free and legal, and cannot produce any results that conform to the wishes of the people of South Vietnam. Everything performed in South Vietnam under the arrangement of the United States is merely an attempt to restore, maintain, and strengthen the rule of the United States and its puppets there.

    The statement pointed out that whether U.S. imperialism and its puppets hold "elections" or not, whether they establish a civilian government or a military government, it will not change their policies of aggression and national betrayal in the slightest. The U.S. and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique are inviting the United Nations to "supervise" the "elections" in an attempt to use the U.N.'s signboard to cover up the "election" fraud they are plotting, and to provide a legal basis for the U.S.-puppet regime.

    The statement announced: "The people of South Vietnam and the South Vietnam National Liberation Front resolutely condemn this deceptive act of the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, and oppose any interference by the United Nations in the internal affairs of the people of South Vietnam." "The people of South Vietnam will never be deceived by the U.S. imperialists and their puppets. They are determined to advance their national and comprehensive struggle to completely defeat the U.S. war of aggression, overthrow the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky regime, in order to realize their just goals—independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and ultimately the reunification of the motherland."

### 越南外交部发言人谴责美国利用联合国“监督”南越伪选阴谋  联合国完全无权干涉越南问题  南越民族解放阵线发言人声明南越人民决不受美帝及其仆从的欺骗

    越南外交部发言人谴责美国利用联合国“监督”南越伪选阴谋
    联合国完全无权干涉越南问题
    南越民族解放阵线发言人声明南越人民决不受美帝及其仆从的欺骗
    据新华社河内五日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人四日就美伪集团企图利用联合国“监督”南越伪政权举行所谓“选举”的阴谋受权发表声明指出，联合国完全无权干涉越南问题。联合国有关越南问题的一切决定都是完全无效的。
    声明指出，美国和它的走狗为了挽救腐朽透顶的傀儡政权并为它涂上一层合法的脂粉，打算玩弄一个“选举”骗局，企图在越南南方拼凑出一个所谓“合法政府”。在二十六万美国侵略军、五十多万南越伪军和美国的帮凶军的枪口下举行的所谓“选举”，只不过是一场明目张胆的骗局。正因为这样，美国及其走狗才阴谋把联合国的“观察员”弄来
  “监督”这一“选举”，企图利用联合国的招牌，使这个傀儡集团在国际舆论中“合法化”。同时，它们还企图为联合国干涉越南问题、利用联合国为美国对越南进行的侵略战争效劳铺平道路。
    越南民主共和国外交部向世界爱好和平舆论强烈谴责和抗议美国政府及其走狗的上述恶毒阴谋。
    声明说，联合国完全无权干涉越南问题。西贡伪政权奉美国的命令建议联合国派“观察员”前来南越监督“选举”的丑剧，是完全非法的，是违反一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的，是违反国际法的。联合国关于将在九月间派“观察员”前往越南南方“监督”骗人的“选举”的决定，以及联合国有关越南问题的其他一切决定，都是完全无效的。
    声明说，越南民主共和国外交部相信，联合国内外的爱好和平和主持公理的国家，将坚决揭露和谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的上述手段。美国政府必须承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张；必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须从越南南方撤出美国及其仆从的军队和武器，让越南南方人民根据越南南方民族解放阵线的纲领自己解决越南南方的内部事务；美国政府必须停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动。这是解决越南问题的唯一正确途径。此外，别的道路是没有的。
    据新华社河内五日电　据越南通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人四日受权发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义和阮文绍—阮高其集团策划利用联合国“监督”将在南越举行伪“选举”的阴谋。
    声明指出，阮文绍—阮高其集团被迫答应举行的所谓“选举”，只不过是一个为了安抚正在为推翻伪政权而坚决斗争的越南南方城市人民的欺骗行动。在三十万美国侵略军及其仆从军公然占领越南南方并在那里进行极端残暴的侵略战争的时候，他们在越南南方举行的“选举”不可能是自由、合法的选举，不可能产生任何符合越南南方人民愿望的结果。在美国的布置下，在越南南方上演的一切丑剧只不过企图恢复、保持和加强美国及其仆从在那里的统治。
    声明指出，美帝国主义及其仆从举不举行“选举”，他们是成立文官政府还是军人政府，这丝毫不会改变他们的侵略和卖国政策。美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团邀请联合国“监督”“选举”，是企图利用联合国的招牌来掩盖他们所策划的“选举”骗局，并为美伪政权提供一个合法基础。
    声明宣布：“越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线坚决谴责美帝国主义者及其走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团的这一欺骗行径，反对联合国对越南南方人民内政进行任何干涉。”“越南南方人民决不会受美帝国主义者及其仆从的欺骗。他们坚决推进他们全国性的和全面的斗争，以彻底打败美国的侵略战争，推翻阮文绍—阮高其政权，以实现他们的正义目标——独立、民主、和平、中立进而统一祖国。”
