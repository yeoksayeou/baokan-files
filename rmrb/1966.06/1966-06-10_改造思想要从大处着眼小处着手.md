    Learning is for application, and application is even more important learning. Learning without application is equivalent to not learning. Having it on your lips and written in your notebooks is not real learning, let alone mastering it. Only by rooting Chairman Mao's teachings in our minds and implementing them in our actions can we truly learn well. Leading cadres must especially guard against the tendency of "not being able to use the big things, and not wanting to use the small things." We must start with the big picture, focus on the details, learn a little, use a little, and learn and use repeatedly.
    I studied Chairman Mao's works, read quite a few books, but for a long time, I didn't follow the right path and the results were minimal. In the past, I always thought that the main responsibility of a leading cadre was to grasp the guidelines and policies, so when studying Chairman Mao's works, I couldn't learn "bit by bit" or use "bit by bit" like the soldiers, but had to approach it from the "big picture." I didn't have much schooling when I was young, my theoretical level was low, and my work level was low. I only paid attention to putting some effort into learning theory, and didn't pay attention to putting effort into the word "use." As a result, I didn't want to use the small things, and I couldn't use the big things well. When the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published, I buried myself in it as if I had found a treasure. After 1954, I lived in school twice, determined to read more books thoroughly and "improve" myself well. Over the years, I read through Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," read many key articles again and again, and could recite many quotations. I always got four or five points on exams and was rated as a five-good student upon graduation. Everyone said I learned well, and I also felt like I had a lot of "capital."
    In March 1960, I returned to the army full of confidence, determined to do a good job. However, my person returned, but my thoughts were still in the big city, and I felt uncomfortable everywhere in this small mountain valley. Once, during a chiefs of staff exercise, it started raining heavily just before departure. I saw the rain getting heavier and heavier, and the ground was covered with mud. I was used to walking on the main road, and walking on the small road in the rain and mud made me feel uncomfortable. Coincidentally, a vehicle from the communications detachment came over. They said my eyes were not good, and it was inconvenient to move at night, so they asked me to take the car. I didn't refuse and got in the car. When I arrived at the exercise location, everyone was covered in mud, except for me who was clean. One comrade saw me and said: "The political commissar really knows how to walk. Such heavy rain and not even the soles of his shoes are wet." Although this was a joke, I felt very uncomfortable when I heard it. Later, I heard a lot of comments saying that I couldn't share the joys and sorrows with everyone. This increased my annoyance even more. At that time, I also felt that the comrades were too serious, what was the big deal about walking a little less.
    Soon, I had another conversation with a staff officer. This staff officer was not very settled in his work because his wife worked in the city and couldn't be transferred for a while. I talked to him for a long time, explained many reasons, and finally, he summarized it in one sentence. He said: "The reasons are easy to say, but when you encounter specific problems, it's the same for everyone. Aren't you also unaccustomed to squatting in the mountain valley?" This shot hit accurately and hard. Although the conversation was unsuccessful, it forced me to sit down and think carefully. After thinking it over, I realized that it was really wrong for me to carry this pile of ideological problems. I was troubled, and I couldn't do my job well. I also made a comparison of my situation in recent years: in the past, I lived in the mountain valley and my thinking was very happy. Why did I develop the ideas of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and seeking comfort after living for a few years studying and reading books? The problem lies in the fact that I didn't link the study of theory with practice, especially not putting much effort into the word "use." Theory was theory, and I was still me. Learning was equivalent to not learning.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "As for the theory of Marxism, we must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it lies entirely in application." I was determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and put effort into the word "use." According to my ideological situation at the time, I especially wanted to overcome my thoughts of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and seeking comfort through studying Chairman Mao's works. I decided to do it and put it into action. Afraid of hardship, I would do the hard work, and go to the hard places. If labor was hard, I would go to the company units performing production tasks to squat and work with the soldiers. If camping was hard, I would camp with the soldiers. Once, our regiment camped in a mountainous forest area, marching over a thousand miles. I followed the team to wade through mountains and rivers, without riding a horse once. One day, we marched more than one hundred and ten miles, climbing four big mountains in a row. The weather was hot and the road was difficult. In the end, I was really exhausted. Looking at the horse following me, I really wanted to ride it for a while to catch my breath. But I immediately thought that difficult times are also times for exercise, and I decided to persevere to the end. Although I suffered some hardships, it was a test and exercise for my will.
    As the saying goes, "A towering tree starts from a seedling, and a thousand-mile dike collapses from an ant hole." Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that my wrong thoughts of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and seeking comfort were precisely because I had not strictly demanded myself in some so-called "small things" over the years, and was influenced by bourgeois ideology. To transform my ideology and prevent "peaceful evolution," I must start with the big picture, start with the details, consciously and strictly demand myself at all times and places, and prevent special privileges. Once, when I went to take a bath, a newly arrived waiter brought me a new sheet and a new towel. I asked, "Why change to new ones?" He said, "Those are too dirty, these are cleaner." I said, "It doesn't matter, if others can use them, I can use them too." After taking a bath, I told the waiter: "Leading cadres and soldiers are the same, they are all servants of the people. There is only a revolutionary division of labor, and there is no distinction between noble and lowly in terms of personality. If things are dirty, they should be washed frequently so that everyone can be healthy." When I went to the company to help with work, I never sought special privileges in daily trivial matters such as housing, eating, labor, and walking. I always put myself in the position of an ordinary soldier. I firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "When quantitative change reaches a certain maximum point, it causes the decomposition of the unity and produces a change in quality." Small things are the root of big things, and small problems can develop into big problems. Special privileges in life may turn into political degeneration.
    Over the years, in the process of studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming my subjective world, I have insisted on learning bit by bit and using bit by bit. I feel that it is more practical and the effect is more obvious. Some of the original ideological problems have now been basically overcome. I deeply realize that only by rooting the study of Chairman Mao's works in our minds and implementing them in our actions can we truly learn well.

### 改造思想要从大处着眼小处着手

    改造思想要从大处着眼小处着手
    某团政委　李贵民
    学是为了用，用是更重要的学。学了不用，等于不学。挂在口头上，记在小本上，不是真正的学，更谈不上学到手。要把毛主席的教导扎根在思想上，贯彻到行动上，才能真正学好。领导干部要特别防止“大的用不了，小的不想用”的偏向。要从大处着眼，小处着手，学一点，用一点，反复用，反复学。
    我学习毛主席著作，书读得不少，可是很长一段时间，路子没走对，成效甚小。早先我总认为一个领导干部，主要职责是掌握好方针政策，在学习毛主席著作时，也就不能象战士那样“点点滴滴”的学，“点点滴滴”的用，得从“大的方面来”。我从小没念过几天书，理论水平低，工作水平低，只注意在学理论上下点功夫，没有注意在“用”字上下功夫，结果，小的不愿用，大的用不好。当《毛泽东选集》出版的时候，我就如获至宝埋头苦读。一九五四年以后，我先后两次住校，决心扎扎实实多读些书，把自己好好“提高提高”。几年来，我通读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，许多重点文章读了又读，不少语录都能背得出来，次次考试都是四分五分，毕业时被评为五好学员。大家说我学得不错，我也觉得“本钱”不少了。
    一九六○年三月，我满怀信心回到了部队，决心把工作搞好。可是，人回来了，思想却还留在大城市，处处感到这小山沟别扭。有一次搞首长司令部演习，临出发时，下起了大雨。我看雨越下越大，遍地泥水。大马路走惯了，再走小路，还要淋雨踩泥，心里就不大舒服。正巧，通信分队车子过来了，他们说我眼睛不好，夜间行动不便，让我坐车走，我没有再推辞就上车了。到了演习地点，大家身上都泥泥巴巴，独有我上下干净。有个同志见了说：“政委就是会走路，这么大雨，连鞋底都没湿。”这虽是玩笑，我听了却很不是滋味。以后，还听到不少议论，说我不能和大家同甘苦。这更增加了我的烦恼。当时，我还觉得同志们过分认真，少走点路算个啥问题。
    不久，我又和一个参谋谈话。这个参谋因爱人在城市工作，一时调不来，工作就不大安心。我和他谈了半天，讲了许多道理，最后，叫他一句话给总结了。他说：“道理好说，具体问题碰到谁都一样，你不也是蹲不惯山沟吗？”这一炮打得准，打得狠。话虽没有谈成，却逼着我坐下来好好想想。我左思右想，自己带着这一堆思想问题，确实不对劲。自己苦恼，工作也作不好。我又把自己几年来的情况作了个对比：过去我住在山沟里，思想很愉快。为什么住了几年学，读了几年书，反而滋长了怕苦怕累，贪图安逸的思想呢？问题就在于：学习理论没联系实际，特别是没有在“用”字上狠下功夫，理论是理论，我还是我，学了等于没学。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我决心按照毛主席的教导，在“用”字上下功夫。根据我当时的思想情况，特别要通过学习毛主席著作，克服自己怕苦、怕累，贪图安逸的思想。说干就干，决心从行动上兑现。怕吃苦，就偏干苦活，偏到苦的地方去。劳动苦，我就到执行生产任务的连队蹲点和战士们一起劳动。野营苦，我就和战士们一起野营。一次，我们团在山岳丛林地区野营，行军上千里。我随队跋山涉水，没有骑过一次马。有一天行军一百一十多里，连续爬了四座大山，天气热，道路难走。最后，我实在筋疲力尽了，看看跟着我的那匹马，真想骑一会喘喘气。但我马上想到：艰苦的时候，也正是锻炼的时候，决心坚持走到底。虽然吃了些苦，对自己的意志，却是一次考验和锻炼。
    俗话说：“参天大树起于幼苗，千里之堤溃于蚁穴”。我通过学习毛主席著作，认识到自己怕苦、怕累，贪图安逸的错误思想，正是由于几年来在一些所谓“小事”上对自己要求不严，受了资产阶级思想的影响。要改造自己的思想，防止“和平演变”，就要从大处着眼，小处入手，随时随地自觉地严格要求自己，防止特殊化。有一次去洗澡，一个新来的服务员，给我拿出来一条新垫单，一条新毛巾。我问：“换新的干什么？”他说：“那些太脏了，这个比较干净。”我说：“不要紧，人家能用，我也能用。”洗完澡，我告诉这位服务员：“领导干部和战士一样，都是人民的勤务员，只有革命的分工，没有人格的贵贱，如果东西脏了，就应该经常洗一洗，让大家身体都健康。”我下连帮助工作，在住房、吃饭、劳动、走路等日常小事上，也从不特殊，都把自己放在普通一兵的地位。我牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“数量的变化达到了某一个最高点，引起了统一物的分解，发生了性质上的变化。”小事是大事之根，小问题能发展成大问题，生活上的特殊化可能会变成政治上的变质。
    几年来，我在学习毛主席著作、改造主观世界的过程中，坚持一点一滴地学，一点一滴地用，感到比较实在，效果也比较明显。原来的一些思想问题，现在基本上克服了。我深深体会到：学习毛主席著作，只有扎根在思想上，贯彻在行动上，才算真正学好。
