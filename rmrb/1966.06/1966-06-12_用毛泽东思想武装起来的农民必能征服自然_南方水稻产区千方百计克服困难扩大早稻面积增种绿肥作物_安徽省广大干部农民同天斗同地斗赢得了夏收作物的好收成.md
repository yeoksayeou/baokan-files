    Peasants Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Will Surely Conquer Nature
    Southern Rice Producing Areas Overcome Difficulties in Every Way to Expand Early Rice Acreage and Increase Green Manure Crops
    Broad Masses of Cadres and Peasants in Anhui Province Fight Against Heaven and Earth to Win a Good Harvest of Summer Crops
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th – The transplanting of early rice has concluded in the southern rice producing areas. This year’s early rice production is characterized by: expanded acreage, a surge in green manure, and more improved varieties. This is the result of the broad masses of cadres and commune members in these areas, who have studied Chairman Mao’s writings, further established the thought of farming for the revolution, and actively implemented scientific farming.
    This year, the early rice planting area in provinces and regions such as Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Anhui has expanded. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, the total early rice planting area in the southern rice producing areas has increased by nearly ten million mu compared to last year. Although some rice producing areas in the Yangtze River Basin experienced low temperatures and excessive rainfall during the seedling cultivation period, leading to seedling rot, the cadres and commune members in these areas overcame various difficulties, promptly cultivated supplementary seedlings, and the planting area was not reduced.
    The efforts of communes and production teams in various localities to expand the early rice area in every possible way are inseparable from the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, the masses have displayed high revolutionary enthusiasm for increasing grain production and universally regard expanding the planting area as an important measure for striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. After learning from Dazhai, agricultural water conservancy construction has further developed since last winter and this spring, which has also created conditions for expanding early rice planting.
    Due to the extensive planting of green manure crops and the raising of green duckweed in rice paddies, the amount of fertilizer applied to early rice fields has generally increased this year. The area for the popularization of improved rice varieties, especially high-yielding dwarf rice varieties with significant yield-increasing effects, such as Dwarf Foot Nantou, Guangchang Dwarf, and Pearl Dwarf, is also wider than last year. The three provinces and cities of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have basically popularized improved rice varieties.
    In recent years of practice, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in the southern rice producing areas have become increasingly clear that to obtain high rice yields, it is necessary to farm with revolutionary spirit and carry out production reforms and implement scientific farming. Therefore, the quality of early rice seedling cultivation and transplanting this year is higher than in previous years. Many areas have strengthened the leadership of model fields (spots) on the basis of past model fields (spots). Some responsible cadres from provinces, districts, and counties took “Selected Works of Mao Zedong” and hoes, went to model fields (spots) to stay, labor, and live study and apply Chairman Mao's writings together with the masses in the three great revolutionary movements. At the same time, various localities have also adopted the effective method of "inviting in and sending out" to promote advanced experience in rice production. The farming experience of old peasants in the Chao-Shan area of Guangdong Province and Longxi of Fujian Province, as well as the rice cultivation experience of labor models such as Chen Yongkang of Jiangsu Province and Tian Qifa of Hunan Province, have not only been promoted in their own provinces this year, but also spread to some other provinces and regions in the south. According to incomplete statistics from Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi, more than 6,000 rice technical experts have been invited from other places this year. In some rice producing areas of Jiangsu and Fujian provinces, due to the vigorous promotion of technical experiences such as standardized seedling fields and moist seedling fields, although low temperatures and excessive rainfall were encountered during the rice seedling cultivation period this year, there were few instances of seedling rot.
    Relevant departments believe that although the current situation of early rice production in the southern rice producing areas is very good, various localities should still use the view of dividing one into two, not only seeing the favorable situation, but also seeing the shortcomings in production. For example, some areas have delayed the sowing period due to seedling rot, some areas have suddenly expanded the area of high-yielding and fertilizer-resistant improved varieties, and technical guidance has not yet kept up, and some areas have already seen the emergence of rice diseases and insect pests, and so on. Various localities must continue to give prominence to politics, do a good job of people's ideological work, and manage early rice in every possible way, and strive for high yield and bumper harvest.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th – The broad masses of cadres and commune members in Anhui Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish great ambitions, lofty aspirations, fight against heaven, and fight against earth. This year's agricultural production presents an inspiring and excellent situation. Now, the summer crops of the province have all been harvested. Except for individual areas suffering from disaster and reduced production, most areas have good harvests, which are rare good years since liberation. At present, the commune members are joyfully delivering summer grain to the state.
    Anhui Province's good summer harvest this year was not achieved under favorable weather conditions. Since last autumn sowing, there have been severe droughts, frost damage, rust, and armyworms. The broad masses of commune members, who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, are no longer slaves of nature. These disasters have all been overcome by the commune members one by one.
    In the past two years, the production conditions in Anhui Province have undergone great changes, laying the foundation for a good harvest of summer crops this year. This is the result of the hard work and solid work of the broad masses of commune members and cadres who have studied Chairman Mao's writings, established the lofty ambition of the Foolish Old Man, and established a firm confidence in completely changing the backward face of the disaster area. First of all, water conservancy projects have been further improved. The Huai River area, which has suffered from floods for years, has summed up years of experience in water management and crop planting. Starting from the overall situation, it has dismantled a large number of water-blocking projects and gradually established a set of water conservancy systems mainly for drainage (including strip fields, terrace fields, electric irrigation and drainage stations, and embankments), which has greatly improved disaster resistance capabilities. This spring, Wuhe County suffered a rainstorm of 270 millimeters, and 260,000 mu of wheat in the county were flooded. However, due to the effect of strip fields, terrace fields, and electric irrigation and drainage stations, only a few thousand mu were reduced in production, and the rest achieved good harvests. Various localities have also made great efforts to build fertilizer infrastructure, greatly increasing fertilizer sources, and the amount of fertilizer accumulation and application has exceeded any previous year. This year, Anhui has also promoted excellent varieties such as "Early Foreign Wheat", "Jili", "Abo", and "Nanda 2419" according to local conditions, and the quantity and area are also unprecedented.
    All of this is the result of the provincial Party committees at all levels holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the broad masses of cadres and commune members to live study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, and firmly grasping the prominence of politics. During the summer harvest season, our reporter visited the Huai River Plain and strongly felt the tremendous changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of cadres and commune members in this area. They are determined to make revolution in this old disaster area, and the past thoughts of relying on the state, following the old ways, and sticking to conventions have been swept away. In particular, the old disaster areas with more natural disasters and lower agricultural yields have seen even greater enthusiasm and confidence among cadres and commune members, and the increase in production this year is also relatively large. For example, Wuhe, Sixian, and Lingbi counties in the Suzhou Prefecture, and Fengtai, Yingshang, and Bozhou counties in the Fuyang Prefecture are all like this. Since last year, a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's writings has been launched in the vast rural areas of Anhui Province, which is the fundamental reason for the profound changes in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of cadres and commune members. Many rural people's commune production teams throughout the province have established groups to study Chairman Mao's writings. Commune members study in the fields during the day and in the cultural rooms at night. Since this year, tens of thousands of activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings have emerged throughout the province. They link with reality, live study and apply Chairman Mao's writings, and greatly promote the ideological revolutionization of people. Therefore, countless good people and good deeds of selflessness, forgetting oneself for the public, loving the collective, loving the country, and actively producing have emerged in rural areas.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民必能征服自然
    南方水稻产区千方百计克服困难扩大早稻面积增种绿肥作物
    安徽省广大干部农民同天斗同地斗赢得了夏收作物的好收成
    新华社十一日讯　南方水稻产区早稻插秧已经结束。今年早稻生产的特点是：面积扩大，绿肥激增，良种多。这是由于这些地区广大干部和社员，大学毛主席著作，进一步树立了为革命种田的思想，积极实行科学种田的结果。
    今年湖南、湖北、广西、安徽等省、区的早稻种植面积都有扩大。据有关部门的初步统计，南方水稻产区早稻种植总面积比去年增加近一千万亩。长江流域有些水稻产区虽然在育秧期间低温多雨，早稻发生烂秧现象，但是这些地区的干部、社员克服了各种困难，及时补育秧苗，播种面积没有减少。
    各地社队在可能的条件下千方百计地扩大早稻面积，是同活学活用毛主席著作分不开的。今年是第三个五年计划的第一年，群众学了毛主席著作后，增产粮食的革命热情高涨，普遍把扩大种植面积，作为争取农业生产丰收的重要措施。各地大学大寨以后，去冬今春农田水利建设有了进一步发展，也为扩种早稻创造了条件。
    由于各地大种绿肥作物和在稻田养绿萍的结果，今年早稻田的施肥量普遍增多。水稻良种，特别是增产效果显著的水稻矮秆良种，如矮脚南特、广场矮、珍珠矮等推广的面积，也比去年广，广东、浙江、上海三个省、市基本上普及了水稻良种。
    在近几年的实践中，南方水稻产区的广大干部、社员越发清楚地认识到：要获得水稻高产，必须用革命精神种田，必须进行生产上的改革，实行科学种田。因此，今年早稻育秧、插秧的质量都高于往年。许多地区在过去办样板田（点）的基础上，加强了对样板田（点）的领导。有些省、区、县的负责干部带着《毛泽东选集》和锄头，到样板田（点）蹲点、劳动，在三大革命运动中同群众一道活学活用毛主席著作。同时，各地还采取过去行之有效的“请进来，派出去”的办法，推广水稻生产先进经验。广东省潮汕和福建省龙溪的老农种田经验，江苏省陈永康和湖南省田启发等劳动模范的种水稻经验，今年不仅在他们本省内推广，而且还传授到南方其他一些省、区。据湖北、湖南、广西三省、区的不完全统计，今年从外地请进来的水稻技术能手达六千多人。江苏、福建两省的一些水稻产区，由于大力推广合式秧田、湿润秧田等技术经验，今年水稻育秧期间虽遇低温多雨天气，很少发生烂秧现象。
    有关部门认为，当前南方水稻产区早稻生产形势虽然很好，各地还要运用一分为二的观点，既看到有利的形势，也要看到生产上的不足。如有些地区因烂秧推迟了播种期，有些地区高产耐肥的良种骤然扩大后，技术指导还未跟上去，有的地区水稻病虫害已经露头，等等。各地要继续突出政治，做好人的思想工作，千方百计地把早稻管好，力争高产多收。
    新华社合肥十一日电　安徽省广大干部和社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树雄心，立壮志，和天斗，和地斗，今年农业生产呈现出令人振奋的大好形势。现在，全省夏收作物已全部登场。除了个别地方遭灾减产以外，绝大部分地区都是好收成，是解放以来不多见的好年景。目前，社员们正欢欣鼓舞地向国家交售夏粮。
    安徽省今年夏季收成好，并不是在风调雨顺的情况下取得的。去年秋种以来，先后发生了严重的干旱、冻害、锈病和粘虫。掌握了毛泽东思想的广大社员，不再是自然的奴隶了。这些灾害，都被社员们一一战胜了。
    安徽省近两年来，生产条件起了很大变化，为今年夏收作物取得好收成打下了基础。这是广大社员和干部学习毛主席著作，立下愚公大志，树立彻底改变灾区落后面貌的坚强信心，苦干实干的成果。首先，水利工程有了进一步改善。历年遭受涝灾的淮北地区总结了多年治水和作物种植的经验，从全局出发，拆除了大量阻水工程，逐步建立起一套以排水为主的水利系统（包括条田、台田、电力排灌站、圈圩筑堤等），大大提高了抗灾能力。今年春天，五河县遭受一次降水二百七十毫米的暴雨袭击，全县二十六万亩小麦受淹。但是，由于条田、台田和电力排灌站起了作用，结果只有几千亩减产，其它都获得好收成。各地还大抓肥料基本建设，大大增加肥料来源，积肥量和施肥水平超过过去任何一年。安徽今年还因地制宜地推广了
  “早洋麦”、“吉利”、“阿勃”、“南大二四一九”等优良品种，数量之多，面积之大，也是历年来所没有的。
    所有这一切，都是全省各级党委高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、领导广大干部和社员活学活用毛主席著作、狠抓突出政治的结果。夏收季节，本社记者访问淮北平原，强烈地感觉到这个地区的广大干部、社员精神面貌的巨大变化。他们立志在这个老灾区闹革命，一些人过去那种依赖国家，因循守旧、故步自封的思想，一扫而光。特别是自然灾害多、农业产量低的老灾区，干部、社员的干劲更足，信心更大，今年增产的幅度也比较大。如宿县专区的五河、泗县、灵璧等县，阜阳专区的凤台、颍上、亳县等县，都是这样。去年以来，安徽省广大农村掀起一个学习毛主席著作的群众运动，是广大干部社员精神面貌发生深刻变化的根本原因。全省许多农村人民公社生产队建立了学习毛主席著作小组。社员白天在田头地边学，晚上在文化室里学。今年以来，全省涌现了数以万计的学习毛主席著作积极分子。他们联系实际，活学活用毛主席著作，大大促进了人的思想革命化。因此，农村出现的舍己为人、为公忘私、热爱集体、热爱国家、积极生产的好人好事多不胜计。
