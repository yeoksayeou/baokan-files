    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, June 24th -- The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published an editorial today, warmly welcoming the Chinese Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai on its visit to Albania.

    In the editorial titled *Welcome, Comrades-in-Arms from Great Socialist China!*, *People's Voice* said: "Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit to our country is a historical event for our people and party, and a powerful expression of the brotherly profound friendship that the great Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China have for our party, our people, and our country. This visit is another new contribution to further strengthening the Albanian-Chinese brotherly friendship and the revolutionary unity of Albania and China, the two peoples, and our two Marxist-Leninist parties."

    The editorial pointed out that the friendship and revolutionary unity of the Albanian and Chinese parties, governments, and peoples were forged by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Enver Hoxha.

    The editorial said: "During this visit, the determination of our two peoples and two parties to support each other in socialist construction and socialist revolution, to forever be loyal to Marxist-Leninist thought, and to develop and strengthen our friendly relations and mutual cooperation will be demonstrated again."

    The editorial pointed out that "the plans and actions of the imperialist reactionaries and the Khrushchev modern revisionists to prevent the great Chinese people from advancing victoriously toward socialism and communism have been shamefully defeated. Today, the People's Republic of China has become a world power with strong political, economic, and military potential, and its international prestige is increasing day by day. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, holding high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have relied on self-reliance to build an independent and powerful socialist economy, and are rapidly building a modern industry, agriculture, culture, and national defense. The achievements made by the great Chinese people in socialist construction are of great significance to the entire international communist movement and workers' movement, to the people of all countries, and to the cause of revolution, socialism, and communism."

    The editorial said that the great struggle of ideological consciousness, especially the ongoing Socialist Cultural Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party, "is another victory for the great revolutionary thought of Mao Zedong, the great Marxist-Leninist leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. The Socialist Cultural Revolution currently underway to eradicate bourgeois and feudal ideology and to consolidate the position of proletarian revolutionary ideology is not only of historical significance to China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, but also of historical significance internationally. This struggle is of great benefit to the international communist movement, to Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries around the world, and to defeating imperialism and revisionism."

    The editorial pointed out when talking about the current international situation, "The new China, independent, free, and socialist, stands tall before the people of the world and has become an indestructible fortress for the people of all countries in their struggle for socialism, freedom, and independence. The Chinese Communist Party, in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, adheres to the correct principled stand and has become a strong shock force in the international communist workers' revolutionary movement. It has consistently and resolutely opposed the Soviet revisionists and their followers, and has fought for the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The exposure and struggle by the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership group is a great contribution to the cause of revolution, to socialism and communism, and to the cause of freedom and independence of the people of all countries. Humanity will never forget this contribution."

    The editorial said, "The Chinese Communist Party, with its resolute stance and struggle against imperialism and against Khrushchev and Tito revisionism, with its high revolutionary spirit and loyalty to the people of all countries, to the cause of revolution and socialism, has become a great inspiring example, winning the sympathy, respect, love, and admiration of all Marxist-Leninist revolutionary forces around the world, and inspiring true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries."

    The editorial concluded, "The Albanian and Chinese people, the two parties, and the two countries will forever hold high the pure banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, the revolutionary banner, the banner of socialism and communism. We will use this banner to overthrow the enemies of imperialism and revisionism, and to advance the glorious cause of socialism and communism for the happiness of our two peoples and the progressive humanity of the world."

    新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》今天发表社论，热烈欢迎由周恩来同志率领的中国党政代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚。
    《人民之声报》在题为《欢迎您，来自伟大的社会主义中国的战友！》的社论中说：“周恩来同志来我国访问，对我国人民和党来说是一个历史性的事件，是伟大中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府对我们党、我国人民和我国怀有的兄弟般的深情厚谊的有力表现。这次访问是对进一步增强阿中兄弟友谊，以及阿中两国、两国人民和我们两个马克思列宁主义政党的革命团结的又一新贡献。”
    社论指出，阿中两党、两国政府和两国人民的友谊和革命团结，是由以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩·霍查为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党锤炼起来的。
    社论说：“在这次访问中，将再次表现我们两国人民和两党决心在社会主义建设和社会主义革命中互相支持，永远忠于马克思列宁主义思想，发展和增强我们的友好联系和互助合作。”
    社论指出，“帝国主义反动派和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者企图阻止伟大的中国人民向社会主义和共产主义胜利进军的计划和行动遭到了可耻的失败。今天，中华人民共和国已经成为世界强国，她具有强大的政治、经济和军事潜力，她的国际威望日益提高。中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想红旗，依靠自力更生建成了独立的强大的社会主义经济，并且正在高速度地建设现代化工业、农业、文化和国防。伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的成就，对整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动、对世界各国人民、对革命、社会主义和共产主义事业具有伟大的意义。”
    社论说，思想意识的伟大斗争，特别是目前由中国共产党领导的还在进行的社会主义文化大革命，“是中国人民、中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的伟大领袖毛泽东的伟大的革命思想的又一胜利。目前，为了铲除资产阶级和封建主义思想，为了巩固无产阶级革命思想的阵地而进行的社会主义文化大革命，不仅对中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设具有历史性意义，而且在国际范围内也具有历史意义。这场斗争对于国际共产主义运动、对全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命者、对战胜帝国主义和修正主义来说，都有莫大的益处。”
    社论在谈到当前国际形势时指出，“独立、自由的社会主义的新中国屹立于世界人民面前，成了各国人民争取社会主义、自由独立的坚不可摧的堡垒。中国共产党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反对帝国主义和反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争中坚持正确的原则立场，成了国际共产主义工人革命运动中的坚强的突击队。她一贯坚决地、毫不妥协地反对苏联修正主义者及其追随者，为社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的团结而斗争。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的揭露和斗争，是对革命事业、对社会主义和共产主义、对各国人民的自由独立事业的巨大贡献。人类将永志不忘这一贡献。”
    社论说，“中国共产党以其反对帝国主义、反对赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义的坚决的立场和斗争，以其高度的革命精神和对各国人民、对革命和社会主义事业的忠诚，成了伟大的鼓舞榜样，赢得了全世界所有马克思列宁主义革命力量的同情、尊敬、热爱和敬仰，鼓舞了真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命者。”
    社论最后说，“阿中两国人民、两党、两国将永远高举战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的纯洁的旗帜，革命的旗帜，社会主义和共产主义的旗帜，我们将用这面大旗打倒帝国主义和修正主义敌人，为了我们两国人民和世界进步人类的幸福而把光辉的社会主义、共产主义事业推向前进。”
