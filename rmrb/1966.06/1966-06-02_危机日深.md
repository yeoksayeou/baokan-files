    On June 1st, a large-scale anti-American demonstration broke out in Hue, South Vietnam. Angry masses attacked and burned the American "Consulate." This is a sign of the further aggravation of the crisis of U.S. imperialism's rule in South Vietnam. It shows that no matter what hard or soft tactics the American aggressors employ, they have been unable to stabilize their colonial rule over South Vietnam.
    Since April this year, the puppet clique fostered by the United States has been in a serious political crisis. On the one hand, the people in the South Vietnamese enemy-occupied areas have launched powerful anti-American demonstrations, demanding the overthrow of the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime. On the other hand, the South Vietnamese puppet cliques have been constantly fighting among themselves and have openly staged a fierce brawl. In order to quell this crisis, the Johnson administration once attempted to use deceptive tricks such as "general elections," "reconciliation," and "organizing a civilian government" to ease the people's resistance and the puppet cliques' infighting, but it did not succeed. When soft tactics failed, they resorted to hard ones. The United States openly supported Nguyen Cao Ky in sending troops to Da Nang, using force to suppress the movement against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique. At that time, U.S. authorities gleefully clamored that the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique had "apparently firmly controlled the situation." They thought that the political situation in South Vietnam could be stabilized from then on. However, the development of the facts ran counter to the wishes of the American aggressors. The U.S.-directed Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique's armed suppression resulted in even stronger anti-American sentiment in South Vietnam, making the U.S. rule in South Vietnam increasingly critical.
    U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are caught in a predicament of being attacked from both inside and outside. The more defeats they suffer militarily, the more unstable their internal affairs become. The more unstable their internal affairs become, the more military setbacks they will suffer. The American aggressors and their running dogs are heading towards complete failure and destruction along such a vicious cycle.

### 危机日深

    危机日深
    六月一日，南越顺化爆发了大规模反美示威。愤怒的群众袭击并焚烧了美国“领事馆”。这是美帝国主义在南越统治危机进一步加剧的标志。它说明，不管美国侵略者怎样施展硬的还是软的手段，都已经无法稳定它对南越的殖民统治了。
    今年四月以来，美国扶植的傀儡集团一直处于严重的政治危机之中。一方面，南越敌占区人民掀起强大的反美示威，要推翻阮高其伪政权。另一方面，南越的傀儡集团不断发生内讧，并且公开演出了一场激烈的火并。为了平息这场危机，约翰逊政府曾经企图用“大选”、“和解”、“组织文官政府”等骗人把戏来缓和人民的反抗和傀儡集团的内讧，但是并未能得逞。软的不行就来硬的，美国公然支持阮高其出兵岘港，用武力镇压反对阮高其集团的运动。当时，美国当权人物曾兴高采烈地叫嚷阮高其傀儡集团“显然已经稳固地控制了局势”。他们以为南越的政治局势从此可以稳定下来。但是，事实的发展同美国侵略者的愿望相反。美国指使阮高其傀儡集团的武力镇压，结果在南越激起了更强烈的反美情绪，使美国在南越的统治危机越来越严重。
    美帝国主义和它的走狗，正陷于内外夹攻的困境之中。它们在军事上越是失利，它们的内部就越是不稳。它们内部越不稳，它们在军事上也就越要遭到挫败。美国侵略者及其走狗正在沿着这样一种恶性循环走向彻底的失败和灭亡。
