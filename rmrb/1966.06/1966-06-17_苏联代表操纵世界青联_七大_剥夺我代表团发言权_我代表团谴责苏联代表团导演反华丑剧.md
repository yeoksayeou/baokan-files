    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 15th. The Seventh Congress of Member Organizations of the World Federation of Democratic Youth is currently being held in Sofia. On June 9th, just as Li Wenyao, head of the Chinese delegation, was delivering a formal speech to the plenary session, the Soviet delegation manipulated the meeting, employing extremely base tactics such as heckling, stomping, booing, disrupting translation work, and cutting off the power, repeatedly interrupting the Chinese delegation's speech, and ultimately even depriving the Chinese delegation of the right to speak. The person in charge of the Chinese youth delegation issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding this matter, strongly protesting this anti-China farce meticulously planned by the Soviet delegation.
    The person in charge of the Chinese youth delegation pointed out: The Soviet delegation's manipulation of the meeting and illegal deprivation of the Chinese delegation's right to speak is a thorough destruction of the most basic democratic principles of international conferences, and another serious step by the Soviet youth organization leaders in more frantically opposing China and splitting the international youth movement after the 23rd Congress of the CPSU. The Soviet delegation's rude behavior fully proves their extreme hatred of truth and revolution, and proves that their so-called joint actions are nothing but deceptive lies. The person in charge of the Chinese youth delegation solemnly pointed out: The just voice of 130 million Chinese youth cannot be suppressed by any force. The anti-China farce directed by the Soviet delegation cannot harm a single hair of the Chinese youth, but can only further expose the shameful features of the Soviet revisionist clique as accomplices of American imperialism and traitors to the revolutionary people of the world.

    苏联代表操纵世界青联“七大”剥夺我代表团发言权
    我代表团谴责苏联代表团导演反华丑剧
    新华社索非亚十五日电　世界青联第七次会员组织大会正在索非亚举行。六月九日，正当中国代表团团长李文耀在全体大会上作正式发言时，苏联代表团操纵会场，采用起哄、跺脚、嘘叫、扰乱翻译工作、切断电源等极端卑劣的手法，一再打断我代表团的发言，并且最后竟然剥夺我代表团的发言权。中国青年代表团负责人就此事向新华社记者发表谈话，强烈抗议苏联代表团精心策划的这一反华丑剧。
    中国青年代表团负责人指出：苏联代表团操纵会议，非法剥夺中国代表团的发言权，这是对国际会议最起码的民主原则的彻底破坏，是苏联青年组织领导人在苏共二十三大后更猖狂反华、分裂国际青年运动的又一严重步骤。苏联代表团的这种蛮横作法，充分证明他们极端仇视真理，仇视革命，证明他们口口声声的所谓联合行动都不过是骗人的鬼话。中国青年代表团负责人严正指出：一亿三千万中国青年正义的声音是任何力量也压制不了的。苏联代表团导演的反华丑剧，损害不了中国青年的一根毫毛，只能更进一步地暴露了苏联修正主义集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶、世界革命人民的叛徒的可耻面目。
