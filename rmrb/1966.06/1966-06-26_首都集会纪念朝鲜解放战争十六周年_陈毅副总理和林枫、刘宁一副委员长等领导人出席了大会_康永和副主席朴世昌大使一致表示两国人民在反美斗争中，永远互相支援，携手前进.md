	Capital Rally Commemorates the 16th Anniversary of the Korean War

	Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairmen Lin Feng, Liu Ningyi, and other leaders attended the meeting.

	Vice Chairman Kang Yonghe and Ambassador Pak Se-chang both expressed that the peoples of the two countries will always support each other in the struggle against the United States and march forward together.

	Xinhua News Agency, June 25th - Today, over 1,500 people from various sectors in the capital held a rally to commemorate the 16th anniversary of the Korean War, expressing resolute support for the Korean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea and for national reunification.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi of the State Council, Vice Chairman Lin Feng of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman and Vice Chairman of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army Li Tianyou, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong attended the meeting.

	Vice Chairman Kang Yonghe of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and Ambassador Pak Se-chang of North Korea both spoke at the meeting. They praised the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, expressing that the peoples of the two countries will always support each other in the struggle against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and march forward together. In his speech, Kang Yonghe condemned U.S. imperialism for intensifying its "global strategy" and condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as U.S. imperialism's accomplices. He emphasized that only by resolutely opposing modern revisionism can one successfully oppose U.S. imperialism.

	Kang Yonghe said, sixteen years ago, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party led by Comrade Kim Il-sung, with the sympathy and support of the revolutionary peoples of the world, the Korean people rose up to resist the armed invasion of the American bandits. After three years of bloody struggle, they achieved a great victory in the war of national liberation. The Korean people's struggle for victory has greatly inspired all oppressed peoples and nations in the world and has made a tremendous contribution to the defense of peace in Asia and the world. He said that the results of the Korean War fully demonstrate that the decisive factor in determining the outcome of a war is people, their awareness, courage, and spirit of sacrifice; not things, not some new weapons. The ferocious U.S. imperialism has been exposed in the face of a powerful people's war, and is nothing but a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

	He condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying South Korea, supporting the puppet regime in South Korea, and imposing fascist rule on the people, violating the Korean Armistice Agreement. He condemned U.S. imperialism for orchestrating the signing of the "Korean-Japanese Treaty" between the Japanese reactionaries and the Park Chung-hee puppet clique, thereby reintroducing Japanese militarism into South Korea, making South Korea a double colony of the United States and Japan.

	Kang Yonghe pointed out that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its "global strategy." Recently, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, nine of its accomplices, satellites, and lackeys held a so-called "Ministerial Conference on Asia and the Pacific Region" in Seoul, a counter-revolutionary black meeting. This is an important step for U.S. imperialism to intensify the formation of an "anti-communist alliance in Asia" with Japan as the core and to plan the expansion of the war of aggression in Asia.

	Kang Yonghe condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for adopting a two-faced approach of false condemnation and real betrayal towards the "Seoul Conference." He said that the Seoul anti-communist conference has aroused the indignant denunciation of the peoples of Korea, Vietnam, China, and other peace-loving countries and peoples. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership issued a false condemnation statement, putting on a show. Everyone knows that the Soviet revisionist leadership is particularly eager to help the United States build a so-called "wall of containment" around China. The Soviet revisionist leadership has allowed U.S. imperialism to shift its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia, enabling the United States to transfer troops stationed in Western Europe to invade Vietnam. The Soviet revisionist leadership is in collusion with U.S. imperialism to intensify the support for Japanese militarism, eagerly pursuing "Soviet-Japanese cooperation," with the sole purpose of forming a Soviet-U.S.-Japan alliance.

	Kang Yonghe condemned that the Soviet revisionist leadership openly sent representatives to sit on the same bench with the "representatives" of the South Korean, South Vietnamese puppet cliques, and the Kuomintang bandits to hold meetings. The Soviet revisionist leadership is acting as a broker for the Johnson administration's "peace talks" fraud in the Vietnam issue. The Soviet revisionist leadership is also colluding with the reactionaries of Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, and "Malaysia." All this proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership's attitude towards the "Seoul Conference" is completely a two-faced approach of false support and real betrayal of the struggles of various countries' peoples.

	Kang Yonghe emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the most brutal aggressor in contemporary times, the enemy of national liberation and world peace. The Soviet revisionist leadership is the accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the destroyer of the revolutionary movements of various countries' peoples. To unite with the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership for "joint action" is equivalent to uniting with U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism, the Park Chung-hee traitorous clique, and other reactionaries to oppose the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, the Vietnamese people, and the revolutionary peoples of various countries. This practice of not distinguishing between enemies and friends, treating enemies as friends, is a betrayal of the revolution. Modern revisionism, in collaboration with U.S. imperialism within the revolutionary ranks, plays the role of an accomplice that no imperialism and reactionaries can play in opposing the peoples of the world.

	He emphasized that only by resolutely opposing modern revisionism can one successfully oppose U.S. imperialism. To carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end, we must resolutely draw a clear political, ideological, and organizational line with modern revisionism and wage a principled struggle against them. Everyone can see that the new leadership of the Soviet Union, in order to pursue the line of Soviet-U.S. cooperation, is walking further and further down the road of surrendering to U.S. imperialism and betraying the interests of the peoples of various countries. They are worse and more cunning than Khrushchev. We must have no illusions about them and must expose and strike them mercilessly, carrying the struggle against modern revisionism to the end.

	Kang Yonghe said that U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They are just a small clique. More than 90% of the world's population are people who want revolution and liberation. To the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike the most vicious common enemy, U.S. imperialism. All countries and peoples who have been invaded, controlled, interfered with, and bullied by the United States should unite, forming the broadest and most genuine, not narrow and hypocritical, international anti-U.S. united front. The more this united front develops and consolidates, the less hiding place there will be for U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices.

	Kang Yonghe said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the tiger is terrifying, but in reality, he is afraid of the people. In essence, it is a paper tiger. As long as people are not afraid of him and dare to struggle against him, expose him, and overthrow him, it is not difficult to do." The Korean War that broke out sixteen years ago proved this truth. Today's Vietnam War further proves this truth. U.S. imperialism has been expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam and deploying military attacks on China and Korea. However, the heroic Korean people and the Vietnamese people are not to be trifled with. The Chinese people are also not to be trifled with. Just as the Chinese People's Volunteers fought in Korea to aid Korea and defend the motherland, we are ready at any time to fight to support the anti-aggression struggles of the peoples of various countries and to fight to defend the security of our motherland and the peace of Asia and the world.

	When talking about the deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries, Kang Yonghe said, the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Korea are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and on the principles of independence, self-reliance, and equality. It can withstand any severe test and cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces.

	When talking about the domestic situation, Kang Yonghe said, our people are vigorously carrying out a great proletarian cultural revolution under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a fierce struggle in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a key issue in the deepening of our revolution in this stage, and a top priority that concerns the future and destiny of our country and the future and destiny of the world revolution. The Chinese people are determined to carry this struggle to the end. We believe that through this revolutionary struggle, the socialist consciousness of our people will be greatly enhanced, the spirit of socialist revolution will be greatly promoted, and the progress of our socialist construction will be greatly accelerated. Currently, the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country has already borne rich fruits, and a new era of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasping and applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought has begun in our country. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism of our time, a powerful weapon for the Chinese people to be invincible, and also a powerful weapon for the revolutionary peoples of the world to be invincible. Our people admire it without limit, and the revolutionary peoples of the world admire it without limit. We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in carrying the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries to the end, and strive for the gradual realization of communism in the world.

	Ambassador Pak Se-chang then spoke. He said that in the face of the heroic struggle of the Korean people, the aggressive war launched by the U.S. imperialist bandits sixteen years ago suffered a humiliating defeat, which clearly shows that any small country and weak nation, as long as it is closely united, takes up arms, and fights bravely, can defeat any imperialist bandit.

	He said that the Korean people will never forget the heroic image of the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought bravely on the highlands and villages of Korea. The U.S. imperialists have not learned from the humiliating defeat in the Korean War but continue to occupy South Korea, repeatedly and brutally violate the armistice agreement, bring in various new weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic and missile weapons, and continuously carry out provocations and military exercises against the northern part of the Republic. The U.S. imperialists are also intensifying the collusion between Japanese militarists and the South Korean puppets to quickly establish an aggressive "Northeast Asian Military Alliance" with Japanese imperialists as the backbone. He said that recently, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, its lackeys and puppets held a so-called "Ministerial Conference on Asia and the Pacific Region" in Seoul. This conference plotted a sinister conspiracy to form a new aggressive military bloc to oppose the socialist countries and national liberation movements in Asia.

	The ambassador said that U.S. imperialism is the culprit obstructing the reunification of Korea, the root cause of the misfortune and suffering of the South Korean people today. The Korean people must drive the U.S. invaders out of South Korea and complete the historical task of reunifying the motherland. If the U.S. imperialists dare to launch another military adventure in Korea, then the invaders will surely suffer a devastating blow in the face of the united people of our country.

	The ambassador condemned U.S. imperialism for expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam, plotting to spread the flames of war to the entire Indochina and Asia. He also condemned the faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, the Park Chung-hee clique, for sending the young and strong men of South Korea to the front lines of the U.S. war in Vietnam to be cannon fodder. He said that the Korean people firmly stand on the side of the Vietnamese people and will oppose the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, in any situation, and fight side by side with the brotherly Vietnamese people to the end.

	Ambassador Pak Se-chang said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant results in socialist construction and strengthening national defense. He said that in the common struggle against the world's reactionary leader, U.S. imperialism, the friendship and unity between the two countries' peoples have been inherited and developed. The friendly relations between the two countries have been further consolidated and developed through comradely cooperation and mutual support in socialist construction and through the struggle to oppose U.S. imperialism and achieve the final victory of the socialist cause. The peoples of the two countries, who have always fought side by side in the long-term common struggle against imperialism, will, in any storm, share weal and woe, and march forward hand in hand.

	Today's meeting was jointly organized by the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the China-Korea Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation. The responsible persons of these units participated in the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Yang Jie of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.

	Diplomats from the Korean Embassy in China, Korean experts and students in Beijing, and Vietnamese friends in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting.

	Among the invited guests were Nguyen Van Thieu, Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Japanese peace activist Nishizono Teru, representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand Mongkhol Nanasuk, Head of the Malayan National Liberation League Representative Office in China Sharmah, Indonesian peace activist Willy Halim, American friend Coverland, New Zealand peace activist Louis Ayling, Australian friend Mrs. F. Russell, and Head of the Palestine Liberation Organization Office in Beijing Rashid Said Galib, among others.

	On June 25th, over 1,500 people from various sectors in the capital held a rally to commemorate the 16th anniversary of the Korean War, expressing resolute support for the Korean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea and for national reunification.

	Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Lin Feng, Vice Chairman Liu Ningyi, and others attended the meeting. The photo shows the meeting venue.

    首都集会纪念朝鲜解放战争十六周年
    陈毅副总理和林枫、刘宁一副委员长等领导人出席了大会
    康永和副主席朴世昌大使一致表示两国人民在反美斗争中，永远互相支援，携手前进
    新华社二十五日讯　首都各界一千五百多人今天举行集会，纪念“六·二五”朝鲜人民祖国解放战争十六周年，表示坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜、争取祖国统一的正义斗争。
    国务院副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长林枫，人大常委会副委员长、中国和委会副主席刘宁一，政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑，外交部副部长韩念龙等出席了大会。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席康永和，朝鲜驻中国大使朴世昌，先后在大会上讲了话。他们赞扬了中朝两国人民的深厚友谊，表示两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，永远互相支援，携手前进。康永和在讲话中谴责美帝国主义加紧推行它的“全球战略”，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当了美帝国主义的帮凶。他强调说，只有坚决反对现代修正主义才能胜利地反对美帝国主义。
    康永和说，十六年前，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在世界革命人民的同情和支援下，奋起抗击美国强盗的武装侵略，经过三年的浴血奋战，取得了祖国解放战争的伟大胜利。朝鲜人民的胜利斗争给了全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族极大的鼓舞，对保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。他说，朝鲜战争的结果充分表明，决定战争胜负的因素是人，是人的觉悟、勇敢和牺牲精神；而不是物，不是什么新式武器。穷凶极恶的美帝国主义在强大的人民战争中原形毕露，只不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。
    他谴责美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜，扶植南朝鲜傀儡政权，对人民实行残酷的法西斯统治，破坏朝鲜停战协定的罪行。谴责美帝国主义撮合日本反动派和朴正熙傀儡集团签订“韩日条约”，从而把日本军国主义势力再一次引入南朝鲜，使南朝鲜沦为美国和日本的双重殖民地。
    康永和指出，美帝国主义正在变本加厉地推行它的“全球战略”。最近，在美帝国主义的导演下，九家美国的帮凶、附庸和走狗在汉城举行了一个所谓“亚洲及太平洋地区部长会议”的反共黑会。这是美帝国主义加紧拼凑以日本为核心的“亚洲反共联盟”、策划扩大亚洲侵略战争的重要步骤。
    康永和谴责苏联修正主义领导集团对于“汉城会议”采取假谴责、真出卖的两面手法。他说，汉城反共会议已经激起朝鲜、越南、中国和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的愤怒声讨。但是，苏联修正主义领导集团却装腔作势发表了一个假谴责的声明。大家知道，苏联修正主义领导集团特别热中于帮助美国在中国周围建立一道所谓“遏制的墙”。苏联修正主义领导集团纵容美帝国主义把它的反革命全球战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲，使美国得以把驻在西欧的部队源源东调去侵略越南。苏联修正主义领导集团配合美帝国主义加紧扶植日本军国主义的政策，苦苦追求“苏日合作”，其目的无非是要合伙搞一个苏美日联盟。
    康永和谴责说，苏联修正主义领导集团公然派代表同南朝鲜、南越等傀儡集团和蒋介石匪帮的“代表”坐在一条板凳上开会。苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上为约翰逊政府充当贩卖“和谈”骗局的掮客。苏联修正主义领导集团还同印度尼西亚反动派、泰国反动派、老挝反动派和“马来西亚”勾勾搭搭。这都证明苏联修正主义领导集团对于“汉城会议”所作的姿态，完全是一种对各国人民斗争假支持、真出卖的两面手法。
    康永和强调指出，美帝国主义是当代最残暴的侵略者，是民族解放和世界和平的死敌。苏联修正主义领导集团就是美帝国主义的帮凶，就是各国人民革命运动的破坏者。同以苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者采取“联合行动”，等于联合美帝国主义、联合日本军国主义、联合朴正熙卖国集团及其他反动派来反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、反对中国、反对越南人民和各国革命人民。这种敌我不分、认敌为友的做法，是对革命的背叛。现代修正主义在革命队伍内部配合美帝国主义，反对世界人民，起着任何帝国主义和反动派都不可能起的帮凶作用。
    他强调说，只有坚决反对现代修正主义才能胜利地反对美帝国主义。为了把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，我们必须坚决同现代修正主义在政治上、思想上和组织上划清界限，并同他们作原则性的斗争。谁都可以看到，苏联新领导集团为了推行苏美合作的路线，在投降美帝国主义、出卖各国人民利益的道路上越走越远。他们比赫鲁晓夫更坏、更狡猾。对于他们，绝不能抱丝毫幻想，必须无情地揭露和打击，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    康永和说，美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和一切反动派都是纸老虎。它们合起来只不过是一小撮。占全世界人口百分之九十以上的人民是要革命、要解放的。为了最大限度地孤立和打击最凶恶的共同敌人美帝国主义，所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人民应该团结起来，结成最广泛而不是狭隘的、最真实而不是虚伪的国际反美统一战线。这条统一战线越是发展、越是巩固，美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶就越无藏身之所。
    康永和说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”“如果他们要打，就把他们彻底消灭。事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”十六年前爆发的朝鲜战争证明了这个真理。今天的越南战争进一步证明了这个真理。美帝国主义一直在扩大侵越战争，并部署对中国和朝鲜的军事进攻。但是，英雄的朝鲜人民和越南人民都不是好惹的。中国人民也决不是好惹的。就象中国人民志愿军抗美援朝、保家卫国那样，我们随时准备着为支援各国人民的反侵略斗争而战，为保卫祖国安全、保卫亚洲和世界和平而战。
    在谈到中朝两国人民的深厚友谊时，康永和说，中朝两国人民的友谊和团结，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是建立在独立自主和平等的原则基础上的。它是经得起任何严峻考验的，是任何反动力量所破坏不了的。
    康永和在谈到国内形势时说，我国人民正高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗猛烈地展开一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是一场意识形态领域中无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁的激烈斗争，是现阶段我国革命深入发展的关键问题，是关系到我们国家的前途和命运、也关系到世界革命的前途和命运的头等大事。中国人民决心要把这场斗争进行到底。我们相信，通过这场革命斗争，必将大大提高我国人民的社会主义觉悟，大大发扬社会主义革命的精神，大大加速我国社会主义建设的进程。目前我国广大的工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的运动已经结出了丰硕的果实，一个工农兵直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新纪元已经在我国开始。毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是我国人民战无不胜的强大武器，也是世界革命人民战无不胜的强大武器。我国人民无限崇拜它，世界革命人民无限钦佩它。我们将世世代代永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持把反对帝国主义、反对修正主义、反对各国反动派的斗争进行到底，为在全世界逐步实现共产主义而奋斗。
    朴世昌大使接着讲话。他说，在朝鲜人民的英勇斗争面前，美帝国主义强盗在十六年前发动的侵略战争遭到了可耻的惨败，这清楚地表明，任何小国和弱小民族，只要紧密团结，拿起武器，进行英勇的斗争，就能够打败任何帝国主义强盗。
    他说，朝鲜人民永远不会忘记在朝鲜的高地和村庄英勇战斗过的中国人民志愿军勇士们的英雄形象。美帝国主义者并没有从朝鲜战争的惨败中吸取教训，而是继续霸占着南朝鲜，不断地粗暴违反停战协定，将各种新式武器运进南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成了原子及火箭基地，不断进行反对共和国北半部的挑衅活动和军事演习。美帝国主义还加紧推动日本军国主义者和南朝鲜傀儡勾结起来，以便尽快建立起以日本帝国主义者为骨干的侵略性“东北亚军事联盟”。他说，最近，在美帝国主义操纵下，它的仆从和傀儡在汉城举行了所谓“亚洲及太平洋地区部长会议”。这个会议策划了一个罪恶阴谋，准备拼凑新的侵略性军事集团，来反对亚洲的社会主义国家和民族解放运动。
    大使说，美帝国主义是阻碍朝鲜统一的罪魁，是今天南朝鲜人民所遭到的不幸和痛苦的祸根。朝鲜人民一定要把美国侵略者从南朝鲜赶出去，完成统一祖国的历史任务。如果美帝国主义者在朝鲜再次进行军事冒险，那么侵略者就必将在团结起来的我国人民面前遭到毁灭性的打击。
    大使谴责美帝国主义扩大对越南的侵略战争，阴谋把战火扩大到印度支那和整个亚洲地区。他还谴责美帝国主义的忠实走狗朴正熙集团，把南朝鲜的青壮年送到美国侵越战争的前线充当炮灰。他说，朝鲜人民坚定地站在越南人民一边，在任何情况下都将反对共同敌人美帝国主义，同兄弟的越南人民并肩战斗到底。
    朴世昌大使说，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，在进行社会主义建设和加强国防力量的斗争中，取得了辉煌的成就。他说，在反对世界反动派头子美帝国主义的共同斗争中，我们两国人民的友谊和团结得到了继承和发展。我们两国的友好关系，通过社会主义建设中的同志般的合作和相互支援，通过反对美帝国主义和争取社会主义事业最后胜利的斗争，得到了进一步的巩固和发展。在反对帝国主义的长期共同斗争中一直并肩战斗的朝中两国人民，在任何风浪中，都将同生死，共患难，相互携手前进。
